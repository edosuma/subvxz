02:28.281 --> 02:30.613
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

02:31.451 --> 02:34.614
<i>A construction foreman in Griffith Park
heard the crash.</i>

02:34.687 --> 02:35.847
Hey!

02:36.489 --> 02:38.855
<i>He saw a cyclist cartwheel off his bike</i>

02:38.925 --> 02:43.191
<i>and slam face-first into the unforgiving
asphalt of Riverside Drive.</i>

02:44.397 --> 02:45.694
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

02:45.765 --> 02:47.665
<i>As we begin our descent
into Los Angeles,</i>

02:47.734 --> 02:51.898
<i>we ask that you please be sure
that your seatbelts are fastened...</i>

02:51.971 --> 02:55.702
<i>A 911 call brought out the troops
from Fire Station 76.</i>

02:57.043 --> 02:58.977
- What happened?
- You had an accident.

02:59.078 --> 03:01.842
- Do you know what happened?
- No shit, I had an accident. What?

03:03.416 --> 03:06.385
<i>I don't remember any of this,
nor do I recall the cause of the spill.</i>

03:06.452 --> 03:08.545
- Our batteries are off.
- I've been in here six hours now, and...

03:08.621 --> 03:11.089
Listen to me. Wait a minute.
We're ready to go...

03:11.157 --> 03:12.681
Hypochondriac.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.288
OR 2.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.289
<i>County-USC was
the closest emergency room,</i>

03:18.364 --> 03:20.355
<i>and I quickly realized</i>

03:20.433 --> 03:21.695
<i>that if you find yourself there</i>

03:21.768 --> 03:25.067
<i>with nothing more than
a bump on the head,</i>

03:29.609 --> 03:35.411
<i>you are one lucky Angeleno.</i>

03:44.123 --> 03:45.249
Wow.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.693
Ready.

03:56.769 --> 03:59.363
<i>I'm not entirely comfortable with this.</i>

04:13.386 --> 04:14.751
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:22.629 --> 04:25.291
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

04:26.065 --> 04:28.693
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

04:31.604 --> 04:33.037
Okay.

04:35.675 --> 04:37.142
Really?

04:44.550 --> 04:48.418
<i>Doctors told me to expect
up to four weeks of disorientation.</i>

04:49.822 --> 04:51.813
Christ. All right.

04:51.891 --> 04:55.952
<i>I'm not asking for sympathy.
I just want you to know, I just...</i>

04:56.029 --> 04:57.257
<i>I'm not asking for sympathy.</i>

04:57.330 --> 04:59.127
I just want you to understand
what's going on

04:59.198 --> 05:01.689
<i>if I start writing about
what a bang-up job</i>

05:01.768 --> 05:03.167
Governor Schwarzenegger's doing.

05:03.236 --> 05:07.263
S- C-H-W-A-R-Z... Scratch that.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.835
Passe. Lacks context.

05:29.562 --> 05:30.654
<i>Right. So the question is...</i>

05:30.730 --> 05:31.958
<i>Hey, Tommy.</i>

05:32.031 --> 05:34.499
<i>Theoretically could I,
seeing as how the Governor has retired</i>

05:34.567 --> 05:37.627
his position at the muscle magazine,
could I interview him?

05:37.704 --> 05:41.868
<i>Right. And will my non- Teutonic lineage
be an issue?</i>

05:42.709 --> 05:47.339
<i>See, no, that's... That's...
It gets to be funny. It's just an article.</i>

05:47.413 --> 05:49.745
Do I need to have been on steroids
for a long time to even apply?

05:49.816 --> 05:51.113
Good.

05:52.985 --> 05:55.886
Gail, I like
the "attention must be paid" reference.

05:55.955 --> 05:58.116
I might move it down a paragraph,
though.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.092
<i>Thanks. I'm getting you a new desk.</i>

06:02.628 --> 06:04.619
Good morning, gentlemen.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.900
<i>- Thanks.
- Hey, guys. Check it out.</i>

06:10.570 --> 06:13.164
I got a study here that says
the number of Americans under 35

06:13.239 --> 06:15.639
who read a newspaper
is now down to 40%.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.868
<i>- Forty?
- Forty.</i>

06:16.943 --> 06:19.070
And the group we're losing mostly
are college-educated women.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.635
- Pull my finger.
- Jesus Christ.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.044
Hey, honey.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.480
<i>"Welcome back, Steve. "
That would have been nice.</i>

06:23.549 --> 06:25.915
<i>Thank you. You know, when Lopez
and I started out together...</i>

06:25.985 --> 06:28.078
You had to walk 20 miles to school
in the snow with no shoes?

06:28.154 --> 06:29.485
...people cared about
what went on in the world.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.352
- Am I right, Steve? I mean, Christ.
- Back when people cared.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.187
We're at war, and the only thing
that sells papers

06:33.259 --> 06:34.624
is a Lindsay Lohan cooch shot.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.093
Jesus, did someone
actually run that in print?

06:36.162 --> 06:37.891
- I thought that was just on the Web.
- All right, all right.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.226
- All I am saying is...
- I didn't see that.

06:39.298 --> 06:41.562
...that if you run an excellent,
if I do say so myself,

06:41.634 --> 06:45.866
front-page piece about how corporate
America is profiting from this war,

06:45.938 --> 06:48.600
and the only reader response you get
is on two hands...

06:48.674 --> 06:49.834
<i>- Meanwhile...
- That was a good piece, by the way.</i>

06:49.909 --> 06:50.933
<i>- Fine. Thanks. You read it?
- I read that.</i>

06:51.010 --> 06:52.910
<i>- Did you really?
- I didn't read it, but I loved it, Curt.</i>

06:52.979 --> 06:55.743
Meanwhile, Lopez here
scrapes his forehead,

06:55.815 --> 06:58.511
and gets, what,
I'm guessing about 75 e-mails

06:58.584 --> 06:59.608
from readers worried about his safety?

06:59.685 --> 07:02.882
<i>- I chased this piece.
- Then I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

07:02.955 --> 07:06.118
<i>There is something
very wrong in this world.</i>

07:06.192 --> 07:07.921
Newsflash, something wrong
with the world.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.518
<i>Yeah.
Your face hurts my feelings, Steve.</i>

07:09.595 --> 07:10.619
<i>That's harassment.</i>

07:10.696 --> 07:12.357
- Mary?
- An environmental group studying...

07:12.432 --> 07:13.490
- Please.
... chemical contaminants

07:13.566 --> 07:14.658
- in people's bodies.
- I literally... No.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.702
- Give some blood and write about it.
- Let me check my e-mails.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.202
I think it would be a good idea for you.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.863
I'm glad you feel that way. I just did that.

07:19.939 --> 07:20.997
What do you think?

07:21.073 --> 07:22.700
<i>The thought in my mind is,
"No, thank you. "</i>

07:22.775 --> 07:25.369
It was funny.
People love it when you bleed.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.605
- Readers.
- Busted.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.169
What is that? What do you call that,
what you just did?

07:28.247 --> 07:29.839
<i>- Transference.
- Freud.</i>

07:29.982 --> 07:31.415
<i>Freud. Thank you. No.</i>

07:31.484 --> 07:32.712
Sorry about the face.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.345
- I hate needles.
- So use it.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.221
<i>Originally used as a camp by settlers</i>

07:40.293 --> 07:43.023
<i>outside of what was then
the village of Los Angeles,</i>

07:43.095 --> 07:47.327
<i>it was called La Plaza Abaja,
or the Lower Plaza.</i>

08:45.124 --> 08:46.455
Stevie Wonder fan?

08:46.526 --> 08:49.359
<i>My Cherie Amour is the song of my life.</i>

08:49.428 --> 08:50.452
<i>Signed, Sealed, Delivered.</i>

08:50.530 --> 08:52.054
But you really shouldn't write
on a violin like that

08:52.131 --> 08:54.565
because you have to treat a violin
like a child, you have to protect it.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.761
You only got two strings.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.098
All I want to do is play music,
and here's the problem

09:00.172 --> 09:01.332
that I'm having right here.

09:01.407 --> 09:04.501
<i>This one's gone, this one's gone,
this little one's out of commission.</i>

09:04.577 --> 09:06.545
But you get that in
Cleveland public schools.

09:06.612 --> 09:07.840
A lot of military statues in Cleveland.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.643
- A very military-oriented city.
- Is that where you're from?

09:09.715 --> 09:11.410
You're not gonna get musicians
on parade there.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.078
<i>You got Severance Hall there.
You have The Music Settlement.</i>

09:14.153 --> 09:15.142
Ohio State University.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.554
<i>Whereas in Los Angeles, you have
Los Angeles PD, you have LA Times,</i>

09:18.624 --> 09:20.057
you have Los Angeles Lakers.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.924
<i>Those are armies, too.
Military regimentation, experimentation,</i>

09:22.995 --> 09:25.327
Roman gable, Roman Catholicism,
Colonel Sanders,

09:25.398 --> 09:26.490
- but this guy right here is...
- Colonel Sanders.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.692
<i>...the quarterback with the orchestra.</i>

09:27.767 --> 09:29.530
Now the cello could back this guy
with the same moves,

09:29.602 --> 09:30.933
<i>but the cello can't be concert master.</i>

09:31.003 --> 09:34.564
No. He leads out, this was
Itzhak Perlman, Jascha Heifetz.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.471
You can't play music
in the winter in Cleveland

09:36.542 --> 09:37.531
because of the ice and the snow.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.601
<i>That's why I prefer Los Angeles
to Beethoven City,</i>

09:39.679 --> 09:41.271
because it never rains
in Southern California,

09:41.347 --> 09:43.542
and if it does, all I have to do
is just go in the tunnel,

09:43.616 --> 09:44.947
<i>I could play to my heart's content.</i>

09:45.017 --> 09:48.783
I'm flabbergasted about the statue.
Aren't you flabbergasted about this?

09:49.455 --> 09:51.923
- Anyway, nice to meet you.
- Do you have any idea how it got here?

09:51.991 --> 09:54.186
- No.
- Maybe they dropped it off late at night.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.354
'Cause it's just astonishing to sit here
for hours and just... Just gaze at it.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.125
- It... It just blows me away.
- No idea.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.460
It really blows me away

10:00.533 --> 10:04.594
that someone as great as Beethoven
was the leader of Los Angeles.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.368
Yeah.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.572
<i>I'm Steve Lopez, LA Times.</i>

10:13.646 --> 10:15.113
- Lopez, L-O-P-E-Z?
- Yeah.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.843
<i>Lopez, Los Angeles Times. Mr. Lopez.</i>

10:17.917 --> 10:19.145
- What's your name?
- Lopez.

10:19.218 --> 10:20.651
Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Junior.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.086
<i>N- A- T-H- A-N-I-E-L A-N- T-H- O-N-Y</i>

10:23.155 --> 10:25.089
A- Y-E-R-S J-U-N-I-O-R.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.153
Or J-R-period.

10:31.797 --> 10:35.426
I apologize for my appearance.
I've had a few setbacks.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.769
Me, too.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.142
Who are Nancy, Paul, and Craig?

10:46.212 --> 10:48.976
<i>Those were my classmates at Juilliard.</i>

10:51.083 --> 10:52.948
<i>Good afternoon, Juilliard School.</i>

10:53.019 --> 10:55.112
Registrar's office, please.

11:01.527 --> 11:02.892
What's up?

11:03.562 --> 11:06.395
It's highly classified. I can't tell you.

11:06.999 --> 11:10.264
- How many?
- More than we can afford to lose.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.997
Evidently, it goes like this.

11:12.071 --> 11:14.130
<i>Stock price sinks, we lose reporters.</i>

11:14.206 --> 11:16.003
<i>Stock price sinks more,
we lose more reporters.</i>

11:16.075 --> 11:17.235
<i>That won't produce more or less...</i>

11:17.309 --> 11:19.641
<i>Hi, this is Steve Lopez from
the LA Times. I'm calling to enquire</i>

11:19.712 --> 11:22.613
as to whether a Nathaniel Anthony Ayers
attended your school.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.616
A- Y-E-R-S. I'm sorry.

11:25.051 --> 11:27.019
Freaking child lock.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.355
- How is our son, by the way?
- He's good.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.224
He likes his classes.
He likes his pre-gay roommate.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.626
You should call him.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.028
- I call him.
- Is a lie.

11:39.098 --> 11:40.656
I call him. He doesn't call me back.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.030
- He calls me back.
- Mary...

11:42.101 --> 11:44.467
- Just try again.
- Yes, Mary.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.595
- Yes, Mary.
- Yes. Yes, Steve.

11:45.671 --> 11:47.502
- I gotta take this call.
- Great.

11:47.573 --> 11:49.837
- Because I don't have a story. Hello?
- Call him.

11:49.909 --> 11:51.536
<i>I'm sorry, we have no record</i>

11:51.610 --> 11:54.135
<i>of a Nathaniel Anthony Ayers
ever attending Juilliard.</i>

11:54.213 --> 11:55.578
Really?

11:56.716 --> 11:59.150
But then I don't have a story.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.786
<i>Thanks for checking.</i>

12:10.863 --> 12:13.388
I'm not doing the blood thing.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.694
I got too many other good ideas.

12:18.137 --> 12:22.301
My dad is gonna freak
when he finds out I met you.

12:22.374 --> 12:24.308
He loves your column.

12:24.376 --> 12:26.003
What about you?

12:27.346 --> 12:30.440
- Well, I don't really read the newspaper.
- Sure.

12:31.517 --> 12:33.542
But when I do...

12:37.256 --> 12:39.986
<i>Hey! Those aren't all for me, are they?</i>

12:40.059 --> 12:42.425
I'm also going to need a clump of hair
and some urine.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.019
<i>That's easy.</i>

12:45.931 --> 12:47.694
- All right.
- Okay.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.191
Make a fist for me.

13:00.546 --> 13:01.638
Come on.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.243
Crap.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.951
<i>- Lopez.
- Mr. Lopez?</i>

13:09.021 --> 13:10.420
Yeah, can you just hold on one second?

13:10.489 --> 13:12.184
I'm having a little
technical difficulty here.

13:12.258 --> 13:15.386
<i>This is Rosie Delgado
from the Juilliard School.</i>

13:16.462 --> 13:17.952
<i>Mr. Lopez?</i>

13:18.030 --> 13:19.827
Yes. Please continue.

13:19.899 --> 13:23.926
<i>After we spoke yesterday, I realized
I only checked our graduates.</i>

13:24.003 --> 13:26.699
<i>So I looked in our matriculates,
and there he was.</i>

13:26.772 --> 13:30.208
<i>Nathaniel Anthony Ayers
enrolled in 1970</i>

13:30.276 --> 13:33.734
<i>and he dropped out toward the end
of his second year.</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:34.871
<i>Thank you.</i>

13:35.848 --> 13:40.683
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.
Nathaniel was shy in our first encounter.</i>

13:40.753 --> 13:43.244
<i>He stepped back... He backed away.</i>

13:43.923 --> 13:47.791
<i>He... Nathaniel is... Is what?</i>

13:47.860 --> 13:51.455
<i>Nathaniel is...
A great column is what Nathaniel is.</i>

13:51.530 --> 13:54.328
<i>Nathaniel is missing.</i>

14:17.590 --> 14:18.921
Son of a bitch.

14:18.991 --> 14:22.119
- Raccoons.
- Oh, yeah?

14:22.194 --> 14:24.458
<i>- That's the culprit.
- Oh, boy.</i>

14:24.930 --> 14:26.830
<i>What are they doing?
They eat the grass?</i>

14:26.899 --> 14:28.628
No, they eat the worms in the grass.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.998
<i>They eat the worms in the grass?</i>

14:30.069 --> 14:32.537
Yeah, we had them.
It's a God-awful mess.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.630
- Wanna know how I got rid of them?
- Yes.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.402
Coyote urine.

14:36.475 --> 14:40.434
- Wow. Coyote urine?
- Seriously. In powdered form.

14:40.512 --> 14:42.810
- Remarkable.
- It's a whole industry, you know.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.906
Funny.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.451
- Hey, I'm Neil, by the way.
- Okay.

15:56.322 --> 16:01.760
<i>Anxiety, restlessness, euphoria.
If you're experiencing...</i>

16:01.827 --> 16:03.954
<i>I would spend every night tossing
and turning...</i>

16:06.031 --> 16:09.159
<i>Wow. Okay, and what is the proper
method of application?</i>

16:09.234 --> 16:10.428
<i>Should I sprinkle it in the yard?</i>

16:10.502 --> 16:13.335
<i>First, you wanna dilute
the urine powder in water.</i>

16:13.405 --> 16:16.670
<i>- Wait, I want to?
- Well, maybe I should say "have to. "</i>

16:16.742 --> 16:21.042
<i>And then you're gonna have to hang
the liquid from trees in plastic bags.</i>

16:21.113 --> 16:23.479
<i>So, people are doing this
all over Southern California?</i>

16:23.549 --> 16:26.609
<i>Oh, yes, sir.
Last month, I sold some to Paula Abdul.</i>

16:26.685 --> 16:30.849
But no Simon Cowell?
'Cause that would be exciting. Figure?

16:32.124 --> 16:36.060
I'm gonna call you back a little later.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.470
Hey.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.476
Hey, Nathaniel.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.075
Remember me?

17:03.322 --> 17:04.482
Sorry.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.154
Maybe have a minute when you're done?

17:13.464 --> 17:14.932
Let me know.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.797
I just saw you, so I...

17:49.334 --> 17:50.596
Nothing.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.010
<i>Mr. Steve Lopez, Los Angeles Times,
Los Angeles, California.</i>

18:04.083 --> 18:05.414
Hey, Nathaniel.

18:05.484 --> 18:06.610
I've been searching for Mr. Beethoven,

18:06.685 --> 18:07.709
but he's slipping away like a dream.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.947
I'm trying to get back into shape,
but I don't have any sheet music.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.354
<i>Beethoven's String Quartet,
Opus 59, Number 1,</i>

18:12.424 --> 18:14.688
<i>Violin Concerto, Opus 61 in D,</i>

18:14.760 --> 18:17.354
<i>Fifth Concerto, Opus 73 in E Flat,
red car, green car,</i>

18:17.429 --> 18:20.489
there goes a police car, and God is right
on the other side of that wall.

18:20.566 --> 18:23.160
I had to dig a hole
to bury some human defecation.

18:23.235 --> 18:24.293
But they didn't have
the human decency...

18:24.369 --> 18:25.393
I was looking for you.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.371
...to use the proper facilities.
- I noticed that you've moved.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.134
Well, it's beautiful here,
because you can play music

18:29.208 --> 18:30.903
and have pigeons clapping
as they take off,

18:30.976 --> 18:32.807
<i>and right there
is The Los Angeles Times Building.</i>

18:32.878 --> 18:34.812
- Right, that's where I work.
- Mr. Steve Lopez, staff writer.

18:34.880 --> 18:35.869
New York, Cleveland, it doesn't matter.

18:35.948 --> 18:36.972
All I have to do is
look up at that building

18:37.049 --> 18:38.038
and I know exactly where I am.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.141
I was thinking about...

18:39.218 --> 18:40.412
I'm in Los Angeles,
Los Angeles, California,

18:40.486 --> 18:41.544
- Los Angeles Lakers.
... writing about you

18:41.620 --> 18:42.609
for the paper.

18:42.688 --> 18:43.814
<i>Magic Johnson,
Magic Johnson Theaters.</i>

18:43.889 --> 18:46.323
Magic Johnson is a basketball player,
but he's also a big, black man.

18:46.391 --> 18:48.484
What if I were to wanna write a story
about you for the newspaper?

18:48.560 --> 18:50.892
<i>Los Angeles Times,
Los Angeles newspaper.</i>

18:50.963 --> 18:53.955
- Staff writer, Mr. Steve Lopez.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

18:54.032 --> 18:57.968
Do you mind if I record this?
And I wanna write a story about you.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.129
A column about how a guy like you
winds up on the street.

19:00.205 --> 19:01.399
- What do you think of that?
- Mr. Lopez needs to do

19:01.473 --> 19:02.599
what Mr. Lopez needs to do.

19:02.674 --> 19:04.733
No one could ever stop Mr. Lopez
from doing what he wants to do.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.937
Are you flying that plane?

19:07.646 --> 19:09.614
No. No, I'm right here.

19:11.016 --> 19:12.040
I don't know how God works.

19:12.117 --> 19:15.143
I called Juilliard, and they said
you went there, but you didn't finish.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.154
I bombed right out of there.
I bombed out of Juilliard.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.849
- Yeah, what happened?
- I just... It didn't happen.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.893
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.951
Anyone I could contact? Family?

19:24.029 --> 19:26.259
Family? Miss Floria Ayers, my mom.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.925
<i>She's a beautician.
Beauty is art. Music is beauty.</i>

19:29.001 --> 19:30.969
I don't do hair. I do my own hair,

19:31.036 --> 19:33.561
but obviously, my mom does
everybody's hair in the community.

19:33.639 --> 19:37.166
<i>They would come for her.
She's quite a woman.</i>

19:37.242 --> 19:40.234
But I don't know how you're gonna talk
to her, though, because she passed.

19:40.312 --> 19:42.507
Okay. Sorry to hear that.

19:44.483 --> 19:45.973
Who could I call?

19:46.051 --> 19:48.747
226-962-6746.

19:50.055 --> 19:51.113
Whose number's that?

19:51.190 --> 19:54.057
You know,
it's a dream out here, Mr. Lopez.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.287
<i>The sun is shining.
The nights are cool and serene,</i>

19:56.361 --> 19:59.298
and I notice that everyone is smiling.

19:59.464 --> 20:02.262
<i>- Delivered just hours before...
- Americans are asking...</i>

20:03.302 --> 20:05.031
Hi, I'm calling for Jennifer Ayers-Moore.

20:05.103 --> 20:07.333
<i>How will we finally win this war?</i>

20:07.406 --> 20:08.395
<i>Hello?</i>

20:08.473 --> 20:10.202
<i>Hi, this is Steve Lopez
from the LA Times.</i>

20:10.275 --> 20:14.336
<i>I spoke with your aunt, I believe, earlier.
She suggested I give you a call.</i>

20:14.413 --> 20:17.382
<i>- About what?
- About your brother, Nathaniel.</i>

20:19.117 --> 20:20.379
Is he dead?

20:20.452 --> 20:23.615
What? No, no, no, he's alive.

20:24.256 --> 20:26.019
<i>Is he all right?</i>

20:27.793 --> 20:33.129
He's... Yeah. He's homeless.
I don't know if you're aware of that.

20:33.699 --> 20:35.826
But he seems very bright, and...
May I record this?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.732
And talented, obviously.
Juilliard and all.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.129
I'm, I'm... I'm sorry.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.536
<i>- Your name again, please?
- Steve Lopez.</i>

20:41.873 --> 20:43.363
Mr. Lopez, why are you calling?

20:43.442 --> 20:46.900
<i>I'm gonna write
a column about Nathaniel.</i>

20:46.979 --> 20:48.105
Why?

20:50.716 --> 20:55.210
Because that's what I do. Everyone has
a story, and it's interesting,

20:55.287 --> 20:58.450
<i>you know, that a Juilliard alum
is now homeless.</i>

20:58.991 --> 21:02.757
<i>But he seems smart
and kind, and... And...</i>

21:03.262 --> 21:07.926
And spends his days filling the city air
with violin music, and I just...

21:08.000 --> 21:09.991
He plays the violin now?

21:11.136 --> 21:15.505
He's... Yeah. Why?
He used to play something else?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.070
Bye, Mama.

21:37.596 --> 21:41.054
- Good morning, Nathaniel.
- Morning, Miss Little John.

21:51.209 --> 21:52.699
So, what do you want to play for me?

21:52.778 --> 21:56.111
I'm going to play some Beethoven, sir.
I'm crazy about Beethoven.

21:56.181 --> 21:58.206
<i>He was younger than me
when he started playing piano,</i>

21:58.283 --> 22:01.047
and I wanted to play the piano,
but so many kids played it,

22:01.119 --> 22:04.088
and there's only one at school,
so it's hard to get practice time in.

22:04.156 --> 22:08.456
So, I chose the cello. Hardly anyone
at school wanted to play the cello.

22:08.527 --> 22:11.189
And Beethoven was composing
when he was only 22,

22:11.263 --> 22:12.753
and I'm already older than that,

22:12.831 --> 22:15.197
so I figure I got a lot of
catching up to do.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.132
Let's hear you play.

22:46.865 --> 22:51.996
<i>He had the talent, that's for sure.
I called his mother that night.</i>

22:52.070 --> 22:56.336
<i>I told her that I thought he was
the most gifted kid I've ever met.</i>

22:57.209 --> 23:00.667
<i>I said that if he made
a full commitment to music,</i>

23:00.746 --> 23:06.514
<i>if he really, really gave it all he had,
the whole world would open up to him.</i>

23:07.753 --> 23:09.448
<i>And he did. He really did.</i>

23:09.521 --> 23:12.820
<i>Go see if Martha's rollers are ready.
They should be on the kitchen table.</i>

23:12.891 --> 23:14.358
Okay, Mama.

23:18.463 --> 23:20.556
Miss Florence, I'll be back in 20.

23:20.632 --> 23:22.099
He ain't gonna get no sleep.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.635
He gonna kill that little girl
before he kills everybody...

23:24.703 --> 23:29.003
$20,000! I told him he gotta buy me
something real pretty. Real pretty.

23:49.327 --> 23:51.693
<i>Before long, it got so that was all he did.</i>

23:51.763 --> 23:54.891
<i>No more football, no more baseball.
Just music.</i>

23:56.701 --> 23:58.794
<i>Day in and day out.</i>

24:04.676 --> 24:07.474
<i>The whole world
was changing around him.</i>

24:07.979 --> 24:10.038
<i>And that was all he did.</i>

24:10.949 --> 24:12.439
<i>Music.</i>

26:11.136 --> 26:12.763
Hey, you awake?

26:42.367 --> 26:45.530
You know what I hear
when you play your music?

26:47.072 --> 26:49.506
I hear the voice of God coming...

26:50.775 --> 26:52.470
I'm serious.

26:58.483 --> 27:01.111
You got something special here, baby.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.554
A way out.

27:05.957 --> 27:09.120
<i>There is a whole world waiting for you.</i>

27:50.635 --> 27:52.865
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

27:53.505 --> 27:57.566
<i>Nathaniel was shy in our first encounter.
Period.</i>

27:57.642 --> 28:00.475
<i>He took a step back
when I approached him to say</i>

28:00.545 --> 28:03.070
<i>I liked the way his violin music</i>

28:03.148 --> 28:06.879
<i>drowned out the jackhammers
on Grand Street. Period.</i>

28:08.219 --> 28:11.279
<i>Nathaniel's first instrument
was the cello.</i>

28:11.356 --> 28:14.553
<i>Strangely, he has never had
any training on the violin instrument.</i>

28:14.626 --> 28:16.355
<i>He has never had... Period.</i>

28:16.428 --> 28:19.022
<i>He has never had
any training on the violin.</i>

28:19.097 --> 28:21.861
<i>He switched to the latter
after winding up on the streets.</i>

28:23.234 --> 28:26.032
<i>One day, I asked him
about his hopes and dreams.</i>

28:26.104 --> 28:30.165
<i>"That's easy," he said.
"I'd like to get these other two strings. "</i>

28:33.978 --> 28:35.912
<i>Dear Mr. Lopez,</i>

28:35.980 --> 28:39.575
<i>this morning I read your article
about the street musician</i>

28:39.651 --> 28:41.482
<i>and was deeply moved.</i>

28:42.420 --> 28:45.048
<i>This cello is one I used for 50 years,</i>

28:45.123 --> 28:47.853
<i>until arthritis got the better of me.</i>

28:48.626 --> 28:51.322
<i>Please pass it along to Mr. Ayers</i>

28:51.396 --> 28:54.627
<i>with my prayers
for his health and safety.</i>

29:11.316 --> 29:12.749
- Nathaniel!
- All I'm trying to do

29:12.817 --> 29:14.114
is work as hard as I can
to clean up the tunnel.

29:14.185 --> 29:16.244
- Hey! Nathaniel!
- But they don't want me to help them.

29:16.321 --> 29:17.447
I won't have it, you know.

29:17.522 --> 29:19.615
- Don't want to have this degradation...
- Are you out of your mind?

29:19.691 --> 29:21.022
...because they just won't respect
that Beethoven...

29:21.092 --> 29:22.218
What are you doing?

29:22.293 --> 29:24.557
...and I try to tell every one of them,
I won't have this nastiness...

29:24.629 --> 29:27.860
- Nathaniel!
... this degradation, I won't have it.

29:28.833 --> 29:30.027
Don't!

29:30.835 --> 29:32.598
Don't! Don't!

29:37.542 --> 29:40.067
<i>I'm not going to have this nastiness
in this tunnel. This degradation.</i>

29:40.145 --> 29:41.203
Good.

29:43.314 --> 29:45.544
Remember when I said
I was gonna write about you?

29:45.617 --> 29:47.414
Well, I did.

29:47.485 --> 29:51.353
When people heard that you were
just playing with two strings,

29:51.923 --> 29:54.517
some of them thought you might want
something better to work with.

29:54.592 --> 29:57.493
No. I can't cover that.

29:57.562 --> 29:59.154
You don't have to pay for it. It's a gift.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.198
- I'm sure it's a very beautiful instrument.
- Free and clear.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.325
People are very, very generous.

30:03.401 --> 30:04.561
But, look, here's the deal.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.230
It's not safe for you to have something
this valuable on the streets...

30:07.305 --> 30:08.567
You don't have to worry
about that, Mr. Lopez.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.005
I've been mugged 24 times.

30:10.074 --> 30:11.735
I will fight to the death
to protect this instrument.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.300
Right, that's my point exactly.

30:13.378 --> 30:14.572
So, apparently there's a place

30:14.646 --> 30:16.477
that's a couple of blocks down
that's called Lamp.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.038
- I can't go... No, I can't go there.
- And I... Hold on.

30:18.116 --> 30:19.140
I can't go... No, I can't go there.

30:19.217 --> 30:20.206
<i>- They smoke cigarettes.
- I talked to the guy.</i>

30:20.285 --> 30:22.446
<i>- He says you can keep it there.
- They drop the butts on the ground.</i>

30:22.520 --> 30:24.579
<i>They do it to torment me. They just...
They do it to torment me.</i>

30:24.656 --> 30:27.420
<i>That's the deal. You wanna play this,
you gotta do it there.</i>

30:27.492 --> 30:29.790
- I can't do that.
- Oh, yeah.

30:34.799 --> 30:39.395
<i>Except for this one time. Take it out
and give it a test drive or whatever.</i>

30:39.904 --> 30:41.531
- So I can play it here?
- For a couple minutes,

30:41.606 --> 30:44.234
and then we're gonna bring it to Lamp.

31:02.827 --> 31:05.455
Laying in there like a pig in a blanket.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.595
Only... Only the greats.
Really, only the greats.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.157
Yo-Yo Ma, Jacqueline du Pre,

31:12.036 --> 31:15.130
and the coolest cucumber of them all is

31:15.206 --> 31:16.605
Janos Starker.

31:17.742 --> 31:21.473
Gotta put rosin on your bow.
It's just like feeding a parakeet.

31:21.546 --> 31:25.277
A bow needs rosin
just like a police car needs prisoners.

35:08.172 --> 35:10.936
So pack it up. We'll bring it to Lamp,
you can get back at it.

35:11.008 --> 35:12.600
I haven't really gotten a chance
to know her yet.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.406
- So...
- I'm not saying you can't play.

35:14.479 --> 35:16.504
<i>- You can. Just not here.
- This is the perfect music environment</i>

35:16.581 --> 35:17.639
<i>- for playing music.
- This?</i>

35:17.715 --> 35:18.909
- No.
- Yes.

35:18.983 --> 35:20.416
<i>This is a sidewalk, okay?</i>

35:20.485 --> 35:23.113
<i>- That's the deal. We made a deal.
- No, no, no. You'll break the bridge.</i>

35:23.187 --> 35:25.815
<i>- You'll put water in it, you'll drown her.
- That's what I'll do?</i>

35:25.890 --> 35:26.879
- It will be ruined.
- Why would I damage it?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.482
- I gave you the damn thing.
- It won't play right ever,

35:28.559 --> 35:30.288
- because, Mr. Lopez, you'll ruin it.
- I'm not going to...

35:30.361 --> 35:31.419
I'm not gonna see you
get killed over this.

35:31.496 --> 35:33.487
You don't know what you're doing.
Let me put it away myself.

35:33.564 --> 35:35.259
<i>Then put it away.</i>

35:35.833 --> 35:37.460
<i>Thank you.</i>

35:39.737 --> 35:42.968
<i>Because when you start
a relationship with somebody...</i>

35:43.040 --> 35:44.871
- Don't make a big deal of it, okay?
- It is a big deal.

35:44.942 --> 35:46.637
In a minute,
you'll have it set up down at Lamp

35:46.711 --> 35:48.474
and be playing like you never stopped.

35:48.546 --> 35:49.638
- Right?
- It's brand-new, this relationship.

35:49.714 --> 35:51.739
- I don't want this relationship to end.
- Do you know where it is?

35:51.816 --> 35:53.943
- No, I can't do that.
- Just leave that there. I'll drive you.

35:54.018 --> 35:55.178
<i>I have my cart there.
I could get it in my cart.</i>

35:55.253 --> 35:56.311
What are you doing?
You're gonna let go.

35:56.387 --> 35:57.445
- Just let your fingers go.
- Does anyone...

35:57.522 --> 35:58.546
Does anyone see
what he's doing right here?

35:58.623 --> 36:01.217
- He's stealing it.
- I'II... I'll meet you there.

36:01.292 --> 36:02.953
San Julian and 6th.

36:03.027 --> 36:04.392
All right?

36:05.129 --> 36:08.394
- I'll drive. You walk.
- I know where it is...

36:08.466 --> 36:10.400
See you in a half hour?

36:28.219 --> 36:30.187
For cash money
I got speed, man.

36:30.254 --> 36:31.551
I'm good.

36:42.600 --> 36:43.828
Jesus.

36:44.402 --> 36:45.630
Fine.

36:46.704 --> 36:48.501
<i>Tennis shoes.</i>

36:49.373 --> 36:50.840
Oh, boy.

37:10.928 --> 37:13.123
One at a time. One at a time.

37:20.771 --> 37:22.500
<i>The pusher. Ten cents.</i>

37:24.575 --> 37:27.009
- Say, hey, is David here?
- Yes?

37:29.046 --> 37:30.707
I'm here for David.

37:30.781 --> 37:32.043
- Who?
- David.

37:32.116 --> 37:34.084
David? I can go get him.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.515
<i>Thanks.</i>

37:39.557 --> 37:40.956
David!

37:41.025 --> 37:42.117
Hey.

37:52.737 --> 37:54.932
- Hi.
- Hi. You a volunteer?

37:55.006 --> 37:57.065
<i>Steve Lopez, Los Angeles Times.</i>

37:57.141 --> 37:59.609
<i>- Don't be scared. Come in.
- Thanks.</i>

38:01.178 --> 38:02.611
Every staff has a key,

38:02.680 --> 38:05.547
so if he does come by and I'm not here,
then anybody can get it for him.

38:05.616 --> 38:06.981
- Well, he'll be here.
- Okay.

38:07.051 --> 38:08.040
He said he was coming.

38:08.152 --> 38:09.847
Can you sign in for me?

38:09.920 --> 38:11.547
<i>- Sure.
- Thanks.</i>

38:13.124 --> 38:14.489
- Afternoon.
- Hi. How are you?

38:15.126 --> 38:18.994
I mean, it's tired.
It's like they can't find the medication

38:19.063 --> 38:21.497
that's right for me, you know?

38:21.565 --> 38:23.430
- You know what I'm trying to say?
- Yeah.

38:23.501 --> 38:26.095
When they put me on lithium,

38:26.170 --> 38:29.037
<i>it was like a portion of my brain</i>

38:29.106 --> 38:31.131
was fully functional.

38:31.876 --> 38:33.673
You know what I mean?

38:33.978 --> 38:36.378
Because it's like when I take
the lithium and everything,

38:36.447 --> 38:39.848
it totally eliminates
the voices in my mind

38:39.917 --> 38:41.714
<i>when they first start rising up,</i>

38:41.786 --> 38:44.380
you know, and it stops them, right there.

38:44.455 --> 38:46.423
I don't like that,
because they just stop them.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.755
<i>Because, see, sometimes
those voices comfort me.</i>

38:49.827 --> 38:53.593
<i>And when they comfort me,
if they give me all this lithium,</i>

38:53.664 --> 38:56.292
<i>then I no longer have the voices
to comfort me.</i>

38:56.367 --> 38:57.698
You understand what I'm saying?

38:57.768 --> 38:59.201
Do you feel what I'm saying to you?

39:05.209 --> 39:06.972
- You mind if I sit here?
- Not at all.

39:07.044 --> 39:08.068
All right.

39:08.145 --> 39:10.136
- I'm Steve.
- I'm Steve, too.

39:10.214 --> 39:11.511
Oh, boy. Hi.

39:11.582 --> 39:14.881
- I knew I picked the right spot.
- Yeah, you're good.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.346
So are you a new Lamp staff, or...

39:20.925 --> 39:24.156
- No. I'm just waiting for somebody.
- Okay.

39:28.432 --> 39:30.457
I just try to keep Leeann happy.

39:30.534 --> 39:34.129
He is a bright spot in my life.
We value the same things.

39:35.239 --> 39:36.638
<i>And we're comfortable together.</i>

39:36.707 --> 39:40.165
<i>Thank you, Leeann.
That's so nice to hear you say that.</i>

39:41.545 --> 39:43.137
I call him Piggy Boy and stuff like that,

39:43.214 --> 39:45.876
but I shouldn't,
because he's in a bad shape.

39:45.950 --> 39:48.077
We thought his problem was cocaine.

39:48.152 --> 39:50.177
- But it was pancreatic cancer.
- Yeah?

39:50.254 --> 39:53.587
KK's French, Egyptian,
and African-American,

39:53.657 --> 39:55.454
<i>and I am a quarter French.</i>

39:55.526 --> 39:57.926
<i>I know about disease.
I know how to treat it.</i>

39:57.995 --> 40:00.793
Now I understand people.
I can help so many people fast,

40:00.865 --> 40:01.923
<i>and I can comfort them.</i>

40:01.999 --> 40:05.366
<i>They've got Italian nurses, 6'4",
in the county hospital.</i>

40:05.436 --> 40:07.495
And one of them talked to me
like I was trash.

40:07.571 --> 40:11.735
Now, this is probably that the hour
of power that the Bible speaks of,

40:11.809 --> 40:14.801
somebody who speaks a harsh
language, will have what the computer...

40:14.879 --> 40:16.210
<i>The computer is probably the beast.</i>

40:16.280 --> 40:18.180
My aunt ended up with
26 shock treatments

40:18.249 --> 40:19.375
because she didn't want to go to bed

40:19.450 --> 40:20.678
with her sex-crazed husband.

40:20.751 --> 40:23.276
He was paying call girls $200 apiece,

40:23.354 --> 40:24.616
going to bed with them
and coming home

40:24.688 --> 40:26.315
and giving my aunt all kinds of diseases.

40:26.390 --> 40:28.415
I got sick. I was working over there.

40:28.492 --> 40:31.893
And I got sicker than a dog one day.
I got an infection in my esophagus.

40:31.962 --> 40:35.159
<i>The neighbor's dog was sick one day
and the only thing I had on hand</i>

40:35.232 --> 40:37.996
was a packet of tetracycline
for my chickens.

40:38.068 --> 40:41.595
<i>So they wouldn't... They were too busy
to treat her at the moment.</i>

40:41.672 --> 40:43.105
<i>- You're fantastic.
- They'd already given her...</i>

40:52.983 --> 40:55.816
Ice cold. Ice cold.

40:55.886 --> 40:58.252
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

40:59.390 --> 41:03.520
<i>I put Nathaniel's new instruments
in safekeeping and waited.</i>

41:05.996 --> 41:08.863
<i>Fifteen minutes.
Thirty minutes. An hour.</i>

41:11.635 --> 41:14.968
<i>Too long, in fact,
'cause guess what, schmuck,</i>

41:15.506 --> 41:17.940
<i>you got a deadline tomorrow.</i>

41:19.276 --> 41:22.677
<i>And the story of a guy not showing up</i>

41:22.746 --> 41:24.407
<i>is not a story.</i>

41:26.283 --> 41:28.774
<i>Nathaniel. Nathaniel. Nathaniel.</i>

41:48.672 --> 41:49.900
Okay.

42:08.392 --> 42:11.828
So, you guys are basically united
by non-belief.

42:12.563 --> 42:14.428
<i>- That's right.
- Yeah.</i>

42:14.498 --> 42:16.466
So, do you non-gather?

42:17.167 --> 42:18.725
And non-worship?

42:18.802 --> 42:20.667
We tried, but...

42:22.506 --> 42:25.304
- Not a lot to talk about.
- Yeah.

42:25.376 --> 42:28.004
- Now we have a website.
- Swell.

42:31.682 --> 42:33.513
Anything else you don't believe in?

42:33.584 --> 42:35.074
- Sorry.
- Yeah, actually...

42:35.152 --> 42:36.847
- Sorry.
- Okay.

42:36.921 --> 42:39.116
<i>- Lopez.
- Can you hear this?</i>

42:39.189 --> 42:40.315
Sorry, can't hear you.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.552
<i>I said, can you hear this?</i>

42:57.575 --> 43:00.567

I am so good, but I still have
to tweak things so I can win.

44:39.843 --> 44:43.040
<i>There's a fine line in performances.</i>

44:43.113 --> 44:45.547
- I mean, I can't let her beat me.
- I really have to practice.

44:46.016 --> 44:47.278
Half an hour is all it takes for me.

It's amazing, right?

47:40.224 --> 47:41.691
Does it look like
I need some anger management to you?

47:41.758 --> 47:43.453
Yeah. Man, I'll take him any day.

47:43.527 --> 47:45.722
He quiets everybody down.

47:45.796 --> 47:49.061
- What does he have, schizophrenia?
- I don't know.

47:50.200 --> 47:54.432
Well, we should hook him up with
psychiatric services and find out, right?

47:54.504 --> 47:57.405
Yeah, I don't get
too hung up on diagnosis.

47:57.908 --> 47:59.876
What do you mean?

47:59.943 --> 48:00.932
What do I mean?

48:01.011 --> 48:05.038
But how do you help somebody
if you don't know what they have?

48:05.549 --> 48:07.244
Look at these people.

48:07.317 --> 48:10.218
Every one of them's been diagnosed
more than you can imagine.

48:10.287 --> 48:12.482
And as far as I can tell,
it hasn't done them any good.

48:12.689 --> 48:15.089
But he needs medication, right?

48:15.158 --> 48:17.786
I'll tell you one thing he doesn't need.

48:17.861 --> 48:21.024
One more person telling him
he needs medication.

48:25.235 --> 48:27.726
Son of a bitch.

48:27.804 --> 48:29.533
- Where'd he go?
- Who?

48:29.606 --> 48:31.904
- Nathaniel.
- Don't ask me, dude.

48:35.679 --> 48:37.374
<i>- Thanks, Steve.
- You're welcome, Steve.</i>

48:40.584 --> 48:43.678
<i>- Keep walking. Keep walking!
- There's a cop over there.</i>

48:43.754 --> 48:46.450
- He'll shoot a nigga with a pop.
- You got that cheese, huh?

48:46.523 --> 48:49.390
- You're right about that cheese.
- Hold on, hold on. Hold up.

48:50.394 --> 48:51.759
Hey, wait!

48:52.396 --> 48:54.364
Want to buy some candy?

49:55.392 --> 49:57.121
Five-o. Five-o.

49:59.730 --> 50:01.789
No way this is gonna be...

50:02.766 --> 50:04.393
<i>That boy's not the real police.</i>

50:04.468 --> 50:07.733
Oh, man.
Hell, man. Where's my piece at, nigga?

50:54.351 --> 50:55.579
Back up.

50:57.220 --> 50:58.278
I went over to the library.

50:58.355 --> 50:59.652
I thought I might pick up
some sheet music.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.782
<i>Sonata Number 1, F Major, Opus 5,</i>

51:01.858 --> 51:04.827
<i>Sonata Number 2 in A Major,

51:04.895 --> 51:06.226
What happened?
Somebody get beat up?

51:06.296 --> 51:07.354
Overdose, I think.

51:07.697 --> 51:10.063
<i>The other night, someone...
There was a beating over here.</i>

51:10.133 --> 51:13.261
Someone got bones rearranged
in their face. It was just crazy.

51:13.336 --> 51:17.204
I don't understand why anybody
would do something like that.

51:17.274 --> 51:19.572
<i>- This where you sleep?
- I used to sleep on Wall Street,</i>

51:19.643 --> 51:21.474
<i>but it's too dirty.</i>

51:37.861 --> 51:41.058
You know, Mr. Lopez, my vision...

51:41.131 --> 51:43.656
I hate to admit it, but I'm gonna have
to be like Beethoven.

51:43.733 --> 51:47.863
<i>Just do what he did and just die.
Thank you, Mr. Lopez.</i>

51:48.905 --> 51:50.429
My vision is not far-off stuff,

51:50.507 --> 51:52.941
just basically getting
across the street safely.

51:53.009 --> 51:54.499
Honor thy father and mother,
and then, hopefully,

51:54.578 --> 51:57.411
the music will take care of itself.

51:57.481 --> 51:58.778
<i>That's really all you can do.</i>

51:58.849 --> 52:00.214
I mean, when you think about it,

52:00.283 --> 52:02.444
there's not much that
you can do other than that.

52:02.519 --> 52:05.249
- Would you care for a drink?
- I'm fine.

52:06.957 --> 52:08.390
<i>Thanks.</i>

52:10.427 --> 52:13.760
Gotta tuck this guy in here,
nice and safe.

52:14.030 --> 52:17.431
Put that down there.
Make sure this corner...

52:17.501 --> 52:18.627
You can rest on this.

52:24.341 --> 52:27.538
Do you think of writers often, Mr. Lopez?

52:27.611 --> 52:31.138
Do you think of writers
the way I think about musicians?

52:34.251 --> 52:37.618
I write for a living,

52:37.687 --> 52:40.781
and it's not like it used to be.

52:42.125 --> 52:43.922
I love thinking about musicians.

52:43.994 --> 52:48.624
<i>I imagine Beethoven and Mozart
in that window where the light is,</i>

52:48.698 --> 52:51.690
and they just hunger and they thirst
like we do.

52:53.069 --> 52:54.593
It's angelic.

52:56.873 --> 52:59.137
I believe these children of God are
gonna be okay tonight.

52:59.209 --> 53:02.144
<i>They're gonna sleep and dream
as humans do.</i>

53:27.904 --> 53:29.337
Our Father,

53:33.009 --> 53:35.637
<i>who art in Heaven,</i>

53:35.712 --> 53:37.577
hallowed be thy name.

53:38.815 --> 53:40.612
<i>Thy kingdom come,</i>

53:42.452 --> 53:44.420
<i>thy will be done,</i>

53:45.789 --> 53:48.758
<i>on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

54:03.106 --> 54:05.006
<i>Give us this day our daily bread...</i>

54:05.075 --> 54:06.667
<i>Just keep it coming. There's plenty.</i>

54:06.743 --> 54:10.907
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

54:10.981 --> 54:14.007
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

54:19.923 --> 54:21.220
<i>I knew only part of his story.</i>

54:21.291 --> 54:24.522
<i>I knew him playing the violin
on a dairy crate in the morning sun,</i>

54:24.594 --> 54:28.997
<i>suspended somewhere between
boy genius and lost traveler.</i>

54:31.268 --> 54:33.862
<i>Every night, my friend Nathaniel tucks
his instruments away</i>

54:33.937 --> 54:36.269
<i>and lays his head
among the predators and hustlers,</i>

54:36.339 --> 54:39.365
<i>among fallen drunks
sprawled in the streets,</i>

54:39.442 --> 54:44.277
<i>as rats the size of meatloaves dart
out of the drains to feed off the squalor.</i>

54:50.487 --> 54:54.321
<i>...lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.</i>

54:54.391 --> 54:58.384
<i>For thine is the kingdom,</i>

54:59.829 --> 55:02.662
<i>the power and the glory,</i>

55:06.269 --> 55:07.759
forever.

55:10.473 --> 55:11.565
<i>Forever and ever.</i>

55:11.641 --> 55:15.509
<i>I tell him this is no place for him.
He says he wants to be here.</i>

55:15.578 --> 55:18.308
<i>He says this is his choice.</i>

55:18.381 --> 55:22.317
<i>Should I take him at his word,
or should I try to force him inside?</i>

55:22.385 --> 55:25.479
<i>Wouldn't a little arm-twisting be
more humane</i>

55:25.555 --> 55:27.079
<i>than leaving him here on the streets</i>

55:27.157 --> 55:31.116
<i>in this lost colony of broken,
helpless souls?</i>

55:32.462 --> 55:34.930
I hope you sleep well, Mr. Lopez.

55:37.701 --> 55:40.534
I hope the whole world sleeps well.

55:53.416 --> 55:55.543
A- D-A-M C-R-A-N-E.
He wants to meet you.

55:55.618 --> 55:56.642
Who?

55:57.453 --> 56:00.547
The guy from the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, Adam Crane.

56:00.622 --> 56:02.317
Wondering if you wanna come
hear a concert

56:02.391 --> 56:05.792
at Disney Hall some time as his guest.

56:05.861 --> 56:07.453
They're doing Beethoven.

56:07.529 --> 56:11.295
- Ludwig van?
- Beethoven, all season long.

56:11.366 --> 56:12.958
<i>They got one coming up. The Third.</i>

56:13.035 --> 56:16.061
<i>- Well, what's the date today?
- No, the Third Symphony.</i>

56:18.540 --> 56:20.201
I'll cause a scene.
I don't wanna cause a scene.

56:20.275 --> 56:21.708
I don't wanna stick out
or anything like that.

56:21.777 --> 56:24.575
So it's just...
It's impossible. It can't happen.

56:28.784 --> 56:31.685
What if I could get us in for a rehearsal?

56:44.399 --> 56:46.264
Nathaniel, let's go.

56:46.335 --> 56:47.529
What I did with the keys right here...

56:47.603 --> 56:48.797
Come on. Lock up the cart.

56:48.871 --> 56:50.270
- No. You know what, Mr. Lopez?
- Come on, we gotta go.

56:50.339 --> 56:51.533
I can't leave my stuff here
with these rascals.

56:51.607 --> 56:52.699
They can't be trusted.
They'll do anything.

56:52.774 --> 56:54.969
Oh, no. We have an entire orchestra
waiting for us. We are gonna go.

56:55.043 --> 56:56.305
They have drug addicts
and cigarette smokers here,

56:56.378 --> 56:57.572
and they will steal all of what I have.

56:57.646 --> 56:59.136
- No one is going to steal your shit.
- I can't leave it.

56:59.214 --> 57:00.408
No, no. We have to get in touch
with the mayor...

57:00.482 --> 57:01.949
- Nathaniel, it's garbage.
... Antonio Villaraigosa...

57:02.017 --> 57:03.678
...or the president.
- No one is gonna steal this garbage.

57:03.752 --> 57:05.117
- In the corner...
- No, no, no, Mr. Lopez,

57:05.187 --> 57:06.654
I'm not gonna be
able to make it up there.

57:06.722 --> 57:07.848
Okay. Oh, boy.

57:07.923 --> 57:10.187
<i>Fantasia. Walt Disney Hall.
Donald Duck.</i>

57:10.325 --> 57:11.792
I have to deal with things here

57:11.860 --> 57:14.727
because I wouldn't leave a dog
with these people here.

57:14.796 --> 57:15.922
Right. Okay. Fine.

57:15.998 --> 57:17.363
A cockroach does not tell a greyhound
what to do.

57:17.432 --> 57:22.028
It's fine! Do you understand? It's fine.

57:22.104 --> 57:25.767
I do not give a smooth fart
if we go or not. Do you understand?

57:25.841 --> 57:28.605
There are a million other things
I could be doing right now.

57:28.677 --> 57:30.702
Obligations,
things that people pay me to do.

57:30.779 --> 57:33.543
I have a job. I'm a professional person.

57:47.563 --> 57:49.087
- Sorry.
- All right.

57:49.164 --> 57:50.358
What?

57:52.501 --> 57:55.129
Still not gonna leave my cart here.

57:57.739 --> 57:58.967
Okay.

58:01.143 --> 58:02.201
Pick a side.

58:02.477 --> 58:05.446
The company is offering you
a very generous exit package.

58:05.514 --> 58:06.503
Yeah.

58:06.582 --> 58:09.210
- I understand how difficult this is.
- Wait!

58:09.952 --> 58:10.976
Right.

58:11.053 --> 58:14.420
Unfortunately, this is the reality
of our business.

58:17.025 --> 58:19.960
Nathaniel, hard left
coming up right here.

58:37.379 --> 58:39.047
Mr. Lopez, are you okay?

58:50.559 --> 58:53.289
How long has it been
since you've been in a concert hall?

58:59.501 --> 59:01.093
This is great.

59:03.138 --> 59:04.332
There's the conductor.

59:13.081 --> 59:16.244
- Just us.
- Yeah, just us.

59:17.686 --> 59:19.779
It's the way it should be.

01:01:35.757 --> 01:01:38.920
- He's in the room.
- Who is?

01:01:38.994 --> 01:01:40.359
Beethoven.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.026
Sing the hate out!

01:01:48.003 --> 01:01:49.197
Stop.

01:01:49.438 --> 01:01:51.633
- All right.
- Strong finish!

01:01:51.706 --> 01:01:52.730
Get up there.

01:01:56.578 --> 01:01:59.479
I'm telling you,
it was such an unbelievable experience,

01:01:59.548 --> 01:02:02.745
the whole thing, the whole day.

01:02:02.818 --> 01:02:07.221
And if you had seen him,
if you could have felt him...

01:02:07.289 --> 01:02:08.586
I mean, it's the same hall.

01:02:08.657 --> 01:02:11.888
We're listening to the same
goddamn music, but... But no.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.894
You see him, it's one thing,
but you feel him...

01:02:13.962 --> 01:02:15.623
I'm watching him.
He's watching the music.

01:02:15.697 --> 01:02:17.392
And while they're playing, I say,

01:02:17.466 --> 01:02:19.866
"My God, there is something
higher out there.

01:02:19.935 --> 01:02:22.768
"Something higher out there,
and he lives in it, and he's with it. "

01:02:22.838 --> 01:02:26.330
I've never even experienced it,
but I can tell...

01:02:26.408 --> 01:02:29.639
I don't even know
what you fucking call it.

01:02:29.711 --> 01:02:33.044
- Grace.
- What? What is it?

01:02:33.114 --> 01:02:36.675
- Grace.
- All right. That's grace?

01:02:36.751 --> 01:02:39.982
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Yeah.

01:02:45.193 --> 01:02:47.593
To be there with him like that

01:02:47.662 --> 01:02:51.359
and see the way that he is transported.
He surrenders.

01:02:52.367 --> 01:02:53.994
Damn it, honey.

01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:58.005
I mean, I've never loved anything
the way that he loves music.

01:03:02.677 --> 01:03:06.807
Hey, come on.
I'm thinking about my day.

01:03:06.882 --> 01:03:08.611
I'm thinking about my day.
I wasn't thinking about you.

01:03:08.683 --> 01:03:10.981
That I believe, honey.

01:03:12.187 --> 01:03:13.518
Call the mayor.
He's been trying to reach you.

01:03:13.588 --> 01:03:15.215
- Which mayor?
- The mayor!

01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:16.848
Okay.

01:03:29.271 --> 01:03:30.295
Call the mayor.

01:03:32.307 --> 01:03:33.467
Thank you.

- I'm good.

01:04:48.016 --> 01:04:49.677
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:04:49.751 --> 01:04:50.740
You need something?

01:04:50.819 --> 01:04:52.377
A man only needs
what he can carry, Mr. Lopez,

01:04:52.454 --> 01:04:54.615
and I have all I can carry right here.
I have my bedding.

01:04:54.689 --> 01:04:56.452
- I have my drums. I have my flower.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:04:56.524 --> 01:04:58.924
- I have my water bottle. I have it all.
- Hey, listen, listen. Listen.

01:04:58.994 --> 01:05:00.825
You can't hang out here.

01:05:00.895 --> 01:05:03.864
- I can't?
- You can't hang out here.

01:05:03.932 --> 01:05:06.093
You can't. Sorry.

01:05:06.167 --> 01:05:09.466
I don't mind that at all, Mr. Lopez.
Not at all.

01:05:09.537 --> 01:05:13.439
You understand, right?
It's a... It's a thing. Policy.

01:05:16.945 --> 01:05:20.346
- I'll be over here if you need me.
- Over there?

01:05:21.416 --> 01:05:23.850
Okay. You all right?

01:05:26.721 --> 01:05:29.246
Yeah, I just... You know, I... Yeah.

01:05:31.292 --> 01:05:33.021
Sorry. I gotta...

01:05:36.197 --> 01:05:39.291
All right, Mr. Lopez, I completely
understand that you're working.

01:05:39.367 --> 01:05:41.892
You're working. You have to work.
People have to work.

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:44.165
All right, get out of the way
when people are working,

01:05:44.239 --> 01:05:45.604
because you don't wanna
stand out there

01:05:45.674 --> 01:05:47.767
in front of people,
especially not Mr. Lopez.

01:05:47.842 --> 01:05:50.538
You stand in front of Mr. Lopez,
he's gonna tell you to get out of here.

01:05:50.612 --> 01:05:52.546
So, it's a lot of work.

01:05:53.648 --> 01:05:56.242
<i>- I think he's good. You know, I really do.
- I'm sure...</i>

01:05:56.317 --> 01:06:00.276
I mean, I just... This is great.
I think... I think it'll really help.

01:06:00.355 --> 01:06:02.289
I feel like you are exactly what he needs.

01:06:02.357 --> 01:06:03.381
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

01:06:03.458 --> 01:06:05.619
<i>- Does that make sense?
- Yes, it does.</i>

01:06:07.562 --> 01:06:10.861
<i>- Graham Claydon. Thank you.
- At your service.</i>

01:06:12.067 --> 01:06:15.161
All we need is a place for them to meet
and rehearse, like an apartment.

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:17.261
You're asking for an apartment
for Nathaniel?

01:06:17.338 --> 01:06:20.432
- Yeah.
- Does he want an apartment? Thanks.

01:06:20.508 --> 01:06:24.103
- Yes.
- And he told you this?

01:06:24.179 --> 01:06:27.080
- Yes.
- You're so full of shit, Lopez.

01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:29.744
- I don't want an apartment.
- Good, 'cause it's not.

01:06:29.818 --> 01:06:31.251
It's actually a music studio

01:06:31.319 --> 01:06:33.150
for Mr. Claydon to give you
the cello lessons.

01:06:33.221 --> 01:06:35.121
Well, why don't we have Mr. Claydon
come down here?

01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:36.316
This is a perfect place to play in,
the tunnel.

01:06:36.391 --> 01:06:37.380
No, Mr. Claydon doesn't like tunnels.

01:06:37.459 --> 01:06:38.949
We'll just have Mr. Claydon come here
to do the lesson.

01:06:39.027 --> 01:06:40.426
- He says it has to be quiet.
- Well...

01:06:40.495 --> 01:06:42.690
It has to be quiet for the cello lessons,
so your apartment...

01:06:42.764 --> 01:06:43.788
It's not my apartment.

01:06:43.865 --> 01:06:45.765
I know. I know. The apartment
that belongs to no one.

01:06:45.834 --> 01:06:47.665
I don't have an apartment.
I don't wanna be in an apartment.

01:06:47.736 --> 01:06:48.828
I don't need an apartment.

01:06:48.903 --> 01:06:50.063
Beethoven lives out
in the freshness of the air.

01:06:50.138 --> 01:06:51.162
Nathaniel, the apartment
is not the point.

01:06:51.239 --> 01:06:52.501
He's the leader of Los Angeles.

01:06:52.574 --> 01:06:54.474
- It's an opportunity.
- "Angeles" means "angels. " You can't...

01:06:54.542 --> 01:06:56.203
- You can't hold down angels.
- Do you want the opportunity?

01:06:56.277 --> 01:06:57.266
- You can't clip angels.
- Stop.

01:06:57.345 --> 01:07:01.179
- Do you want an opportunity or not?
- Do you have an apartment?

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:07.850
No. I have a house.

01:07:16.498 --> 01:07:19.524
So angry. Yelling.

01:07:20.502 --> 01:07:22.436
It doesn't make sense.

01:07:46.127 --> 01:07:48.618
- Do you have a family?
- What?

01:07:48.696 --> 01:07:50.664
Are you a married man?

01:07:52.033 --> 01:07:54.263
- Is there a Mrs. Steve Lopez?
- No.

01:07:56.104 --> 01:08:00.336
I did. Mary. But we split up.

01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:05.343
We have a son, Thomas.
He's in college now.

01:08:05.413 --> 01:08:09.076
Mr. Steve Lopez, Mr. Thomas
Steve Lopez, Mrs. Mary Steve Lopez.

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:13.052
Not Mrs. Lopez. Mary Weston.

01:08:13.121 --> 01:08:17.921
- Mrs. Mary Weston Steve Lopez.
- No. Just Mary Weston. Period.

01:08:17.992 --> 01:08:21.984
We were married. We're not anymore,
so now she's just Mary.

01:08:22.063 --> 01:08:25.999
You were married to Mary,
but you're not married to Mary anymore.

01:08:26.067 --> 01:08:29.036
Correct. Don't ask me how.

01:08:31.406 --> 01:08:35.035
Mrs. Floria Ayers, Miss Jennifer Ayers.

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:37.872
And then there was
Mr. Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Sr.

01:08:37.946 --> 01:08:40.176
He was a big man. He had big hands.

01:08:40.247 --> 01:08:43.479
I have very small hands.

01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:46.349
Fit around a violin, a cello.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.948
Mr. Ayers was a big man,
but he wasn't a god.

01:08:53.895 --> 01:08:55.920
I have my god.

01:08:55.997 --> 01:08:57.395
Mr. Steve Lopez.

01:08:57.465 --> 01:08:58.453
Oh, boy.

01:08:58.533 --> 01:09:00.023
Yeah, you're my god.
Flying around high.

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.796
- You're my god.
- I'm not comfortable being your god.

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:03.167
Mr. Steve Lopez, staff writer,
you are my god.

01:09:03.238 --> 01:09:04.899
- That it? I'm your god?
- Yes, you are. You're my god.

01:09:04.973 --> 01:09:07.305
All right. I am your god.

01:09:07.375 --> 01:09:08.865
And as your god,

01:09:08.943 --> 01:09:11.844
I command you to be at Lamp,
2:00 p. m., one week from today

01:09:11.912 --> 01:09:15.212
for a cello lesson. Done deal.

01:09:18.286 --> 01:09:20.481
And it's a really sweet deal, too.

01:09:20.555 --> 01:09:22.886
'Cause if you show up,
I will grant you eternal life.

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:25.585
Hell, I might even make you a disciple.

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:28.322
If you don't, you're on your own.

01:09:29.997 --> 01:09:31.225
<i>This is my apartment.
This is my apartment.</i>

01:09:31.299 --> 01:09:32.663
<i>This is my apartment.</i>

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:34.224
<i>This is my apartment.
This is my apartment.</i>

01:09:34.301 --> 01:09:35.496
<i>This is my apartment.</i>

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:36.696
<i>Always number one.
Always number two.</i>

01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:37.897
<i>Nathaniel.</i>

01:09:37.971 --> 01:09:39.599
<i>We've always been here,
Nathaniel Ayers.</i>

01:09:39.674 --> 01:09:42.006
<i>I've always been with you, Nathaniel.</i>

01:09:42.076 --> 01:09:45.045
<i>I'll never leave you, Nathaniel.
I love you, Nathaniel.</i>

01:09:45.113 --> 01:09:47.138
<i>- I love you.
- No one else loves you, Nathaniel.</i>

01:09:47.215 --> 01:09:49.944
<i>But I love you, Nathaniel.
I'll protect you, Nathaniel.</i>

01:09:50.018 --> 01:09:53.078
<i>When you fell from Heaven,
they laughed at you, Nathaniel.</i>

01:09:53.154 --> 01:09:56.715
<i>You're my heart, Nathaniel.
I do love you, Nathaniel.</i>

01:09:56.791 --> 01:09:58.918
<i>We'll be together forever, Nathaniel.</i>

01:09:58.993 --> 01:10:00.017
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

01:10:00.094 --> 01:10:01.994
<i>Look, I'll be here
to protect you from the pain.</i>

01:10:02.063 --> 01:10:05.123
<i>- I'll be here to protect you from the pain.
- Fibber. You fibber. You fib.</i>

01:10:05.199 --> 01:10:06.496
<i>I'll protect you from the noise.</i>

01:10:06.567 --> 01:10:08.000
Fear for you. Fear for you.

01:10:08.069 --> 01:10:09.696
<i>I'll protect you from their beady eyes.</i>

01:10:09.771 --> 01:10:11.830
<i>- I'll be here to obey.
- I'll protect you from their eyes.</i>

01:10:13.908 --> 01:10:15.967
<i>- Step right, Nathaniel.
- No one else loves you, Nathaniel.</i>

01:10:16.044 --> 01:10:17.568
<i>You're my boy, Nathaniel.</i>

01:10:17.645 --> 01:10:20.307
<i>- Take off the shoes.
- I'll protect you. I'll protect you.</i>

01:10:20.381 --> 01:10:22.611
No one can kill the child.
That's what the child is about.

01:10:22.684 --> 01:10:23.878
Forget you. Jump off!

01:10:43.204 --> 01:10:44.193
Come on.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.635
Hey. Look at that.

01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:52.145
Don't see those on the street.
Quick right.

01:10:53.448 --> 01:10:55.109
And then, and then...
And then right again, right here.

01:10:55.183 --> 01:10:58.346
Nathaniel. Come on down.

01:10:58.419 --> 01:11:02.913
What are you... Come on. We go down
here and then to the end and left.

01:11:02.991 --> 01:11:04.515
I think we should do the lesson out here.

01:11:04.592 --> 01:11:06.958
No, no, no. It's just this way. Come on.

01:11:07.028 --> 01:11:09.155
Mr. Lopez... Mr. Lopez.

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:11.221
Mr. Lopez, I really think
we should do it out here.

01:11:11.299 --> 01:11:14.325
No, come on. Let's have a look.
It's right down here.

01:11:14.402 --> 01:11:15.869
Mr. Lopez.

01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:18.033
Nathaniel, come on.

01:11:18.406 --> 01:11:20.101
It's really clean.

01:11:23.344 --> 01:11:25.141
Come check it out.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:30.412
We should do it out here. It's better.
I'm more comfortable out here.

01:11:35.256 --> 01:11:36.621
Looks nice.

01:11:38.793 --> 01:11:40.158
Looks nice.

01:11:45.433 --> 01:11:46.900
It's nice.

01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:24.329
Come on. You can do it.

01:12:49.097 --> 01:12:50.359
Hey.

01:12:54.936 --> 01:12:56.062
I can't live here.

01:12:56.137 --> 01:12:58.537
I'll give you a hand with that.

01:13:01.375 --> 01:13:02.569
Got it.

01:13:04.779 --> 01:13:07.270
Oh, boy. Let's get this in nice.

01:13:10.318 --> 01:13:11.376
Good.

01:13:16.691 --> 01:13:17.715
It's great, right?

01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:20.386
I mean, I like it. What do you think?

01:13:22.497 --> 01:13:25.796
It's nice. It's clean.
The bathroom's better than...

01:13:28.002 --> 01:13:29.526
Except for him.

01:13:29.604 --> 01:13:31.231
I don't wanna die in here.

01:13:31.305 --> 01:13:32.567
Don't...

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.732
Somebody could just come in here
and kill me...

01:13:33.808 --> 01:13:35.708
- You'll be fine. Nathaniel?
... and take all of my belongings.

01:13:35.776 --> 01:13:37.300
- Nathaniel, the door locks.
- A fly only lives 12 days.

01:13:37.378 --> 01:13:39.972
What if in 12 days, someone walks
through that door and murders me?

01:13:40.047 --> 01:13:41.742
And I don't care
about this Claydon thing, either.

01:13:41.816 --> 01:13:43.647
Walt Disney Hall. Disney Duck.

01:13:43.718 --> 01:13:45.015
Doesn't make a difference.
I don't need any of that.

01:13:45.086 --> 01:13:47.145
If I'm gonna take a lesson,
I should take the lesson in the tunnel

01:13:47.221 --> 01:13:50.156
where I can hear the city sounds
and not be locked off from life,

01:13:50.224 --> 01:13:51.350
locked off from the world.

01:13:51.425 --> 01:13:53.723
In the tunnel I can hear the music
the way it's supposed to be played.

01:13:53.794 --> 01:13:55.318
Not in this place, there's no city sounds,

01:13:55.396 --> 01:13:58.058
there's no Beethoven,
there's no Los Angeles, California.

01:13:58.132 --> 01:13:59.622
I don't belong here.

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.031
I'm never coming here again.

01:14:32.133 --> 01:14:34.124
Nathaniel, that's Graham Claydon.

01:14:35.803 --> 01:14:37.532
Pleased to meet you, Nathaniel.

01:14:38.839 --> 01:14:41.569
I always love meeting a fellow musician.

01:14:44.145 --> 01:14:46.113
I brought you something.

01:14:46.314 --> 01:14:49.010
I know you're partial to Beethoven,

01:14:49.083 --> 01:14:51.643
so I thought you'd enjoy this,

01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:57.323
because, you know,
without Johann Sebastian

01:14:57.391 --> 01:15:00.622
there would be no Ludwig van.

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:19.279
The A, the D, the A, the D, the A, the D.

01:15:21.182 --> 01:15:23.810
Steady. Don't rush it. Don't rush it.

01:15:29.824 --> 01:15:31.121
And...

01:15:35.529 --> 01:15:37.520
Well, for someone who hasn't had
a lesson in three decades,

01:15:37.598 --> 01:15:39.691
you play quite beautifully.

01:15:40.134 --> 01:15:41.328
Thank you.

01:15:41.402 --> 01:15:42.596
- So...
- Thank you.

01:15:42.703 --> 01:15:45.228
Work on a smoother rhythm
with the right hand.

01:15:45.306 --> 01:15:47.797
And don't stop-start.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:50.366
Carry a phrase all the way through.

01:15:50.611 --> 01:15:51.600
- Great.
- Give you a ride uptown?

01:15:51.712 --> 01:15:53.202
- Thank you.
- Mr. Claydon?

01:15:54.081 --> 01:15:55.981
- Yes.
- Sir?

01:15:57.885 --> 01:16:00.376
Do you think I could be good again?

01:16:02.556 --> 01:16:04.046
Yes, I do.

01:16:06.961 --> 01:16:09.486
I like your apartment, by the way.

01:16:09.897 --> 01:16:11.421
- It's not my apartment.
- It's not. It's just a...

01:16:11.499 --> 01:16:12.659
I don't live here.

01:16:13.034 --> 01:16:14.296
Well, you should.

01:16:15.836 --> 01:16:19.567
God has blessed you
with a gift, Nathaniel.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.871
Nothing pains God more
than when we squander his blessings.

01:16:23.144 --> 01:16:25.612
- You owe it to him to care for this...
- I don't owe God.

01:16:28.049 --> 01:16:30.176
Mr. Steve Lopez is my god.

01:16:30.484 --> 01:16:32.145
- What?
- Star writer for Los Angeles.

01:16:32.219 --> 01:16:34.449
Higher power flying around
with wings like an angel.

01:16:34.522 --> 01:16:36.922
Mr. Steve Lopez is my...

01:16:37.558 --> 01:16:38.582
He doesn't know what he's saying.

01:16:38.659 --> 01:16:40.786
Mr. Graham Claydon is going to tell me
who my god is?

01:16:40.861 --> 01:16:41.850
Down by the car?

01:16:41.929 --> 01:16:43.157
Do you know who my god is,
Mr. Claydon?

01:16:43.297 --> 01:16:45.060
I know who my god is!

01:16:45.132 --> 01:16:46.156
- He's a good teacher.
- I know who my god is.

01:16:46.233 --> 01:16:47.495
You should accept his help gracefully.

01:16:47.568 --> 01:16:49.331
Graceful is the ballerinas at Juilliard.

01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:51.135
Those girls were graceful.

01:16:51.205 --> 01:16:53.833
- Tiny ballerinas just twirling round.
- There's other people in this...

01:16:54.775 --> 01:16:56.174
- Twirling round. Angels.
- All right,

01:16:56.243 --> 01:16:58.370
- graceful as little ballerinas.
- I love them flying around

01:16:58.446 --> 01:17:00.812
like I love Mr. Steve Lopez flying around.

01:17:00.881 --> 01:17:03.042
I love God. I love you!

01:17:10.124 --> 01:17:11.455
I love you.

01:17:14.729 --> 01:17:15.855
I don't want him to love me.

01:17:15.930 --> 01:17:18.091
Well, it looks like
you might have to get over that.

01:17:18.165 --> 01:17:19.427
It's a bad idea.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.468
"I love you, Steve,"
turns into, "You failed me, Steve,"

01:17:21.535 --> 01:17:23.366
turns into very bad things.

01:17:23.437 --> 01:17:25.598
That's my limited experience.

01:17:25.773 --> 01:17:28.298
I don't want to be on the other side
of that with him. Would you?

01:17:28.376 --> 01:17:31.436
He doesn't know if I'm a ballerina,
if I'm God, if I'm an airplane pilot.

01:17:31.512 --> 01:17:34.003
He has no idea what he's saying.

01:17:35.282 --> 01:17:37.409
Is there something you want
from me, Lopez?

01:17:37.618 --> 01:17:39.745
Or did you just come to show me
your prom dress? You look nice.

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:40.809
I want you to help him

01:17:41.155 --> 01:17:42.679
because he's sick
and he needs medication

01:17:42.757 --> 01:17:44.486
and you have a team of doctors here.

01:17:44.558 --> 01:17:46.958
Tell them to sit down with him.
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

01:17:47.395 --> 01:17:49.989
Nathaniel's made it quite clear
he's not ready to speak to a psychiatrist.

01:17:50.064 --> 01:17:51.053
Force him.

01:17:51.198 --> 01:17:52.256
- Force him?
- Tell him to do it.

01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:53.391
Tell him he can't play his instruments

01:17:53.467 --> 01:17:54.491
until he sits down with a shrink.

01:17:54.568 --> 01:17:58.060
- That's not what we do here.
- What you do here is fucked.

01:18:00.174 --> 01:18:01.334
It is.

01:18:02.276 --> 01:18:07.475
Look, even if I did wanna
cohorse Nathaniel into psychiatry...

01:18:07.548 --> 01:18:08.913
- Coerce.
... which... Whatever.

01:18:08.983 --> 01:18:10.746
- Coerce.
- Lf I wanted to do that, which I don't,

01:18:10.818 --> 01:18:13.582
I couldn't force him to take medication.

01:18:13.654 --> 01:18:15.918
The law is the law.
Unless he's an imminent danger

01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:17.787
to himself or someone else...

01:18:17.858 --> 01:18:19.849
Are you gonna answer that, or what?

01:18:24.832 --> 01:18:27.300
I'm in the car. What if he was
a danger to someone else?

01:18:27.368 --> 01:18:31.099
- But he's not.
- Mary, I'm on the way. Relax.

01:18:31.172 --> 01:18:33.367
What if someone said he was?

01:18:33.441 --> 01:18:35.568
What if someone dialed 911
and said Nathaniel had attacked him?

01:18:35.643 --> 01:18:36.667
They'd put him in psychiatric hospital.

01:18:36.744 --> 01:18:38.644
I know you're not thinking
of lying on him, Lopez.

01:18:38.712 --> 01:18:40.703
And then he would be
in a 14-day psychiatric hold,

01:18:40.781 --> 01:18:43.375
they'd put him on meds straight away.

01:18:43.784 --> 01:18:46.252
What if that's all it took
for him to be well?

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.720
What if two weeks of meds,
a two-week window

01:18:48.789 --> 01:18:53.419
into what his life could be,
changed his life? Saved his life?

01:18:54.295 --> 01:18:56.820
Why wouldn't you want to be
part of that?

01:18:58.265 --> 01:19:02.929
Steve, Nathaniel has one thing going
for him right now. A friend.

01:19:04.004 --> 01:19:08.441
If you betray that friendship, you destroy
the only thing he has in this world.

01:19:08.509 --> 01:19:10.977
I don't want to be his only thing.

01:19:17.151 --> 01:19:19.517
Didn't you just tell somebody
you was in your car?

01:19:25.192 --> 01:19:27.023
Mary, relax. What table are we at?

01:19:27.094 --> 01:19:29.221
<i>This is Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, Jr.,
Mr. Lopez. I was calling...</i>

01:19:29.296 --> 01:19:30.490
- Nathaniel.
... because you promised me

01:19:30.564 --> 01:19:32.759
a hard case for my cello
and I haven't received it yet.

01:19:32.833 --> 01:19:34.664
<i>- Yeah?
- And also I need sheet music</i>

01:19:34.735 --> 01:19:36.134
<i>for Beethoven's Second Sonata.</i>

01:19:36.203 --> 01:19:39.866
<i>And also Opus 131 and Septet for
strings and woodwinds, and Opus 20...</i>

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:41.999
Can you just... One sec.

01:19:42.076 --> 01:19:44.977
<i>- ... and also my A string is missing...
- So, we're talking about...</i>

01:19:45.045 --> 01:19:47.479
I need my A string replaced.

01:19:47.548 --> 01:19:50.415
Nathaniel, you know, this is not...

01:19:53.087 --> 01:19:56.181
<i>...his series in the Times
on the struggles and the triumphs</i>

01:19:56.257 --> 01:19:58.452
<i>of Nathaniel Anthony Ayers</i>

01:19:58.526 --> 01:20:01.859
<i>has brought crucial attention to one
of the most pressing issues in our city.</i>

01:20:01.929 --> 01:20:03.556
<i>...promises you should make good
on those promises...</i>

01:20:03.631 --> 01:20:05.155
Get off the phone.

01:20:05.232 --> 01:20:07.996
<i>...to address this problem
with compassion and commitment.</i>

01:20:08.068 --> 01:20:09.092
<i>And in honor of this,</i>

01:20:09.169 --> 01:20:13.367
<i>it is my pleasure to present this year's
Media Award to Steve Lopez.</i>

01:20:15.009 --> 01:20:16.306
Thank you.

01:20:19.446 --> 01:20:21.914
<i>...you know that I can't leave
my cart anywhere.</i>

01:20:21.982 --> 01:20:25.577
<i>It houses my violin, my cello,
and my weapons of mass destruction.</i>

01:20:25.653 --> 01:20:28.645
<i>A child needs protection. You don't want
to put a baby in the trunk of a car</i>

01:20:28.722 --> 01:20:30.883
<i>and have it get bashed up
against the wall.</i>

01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:33.950
<i>Bashed up against the wall.
Bashed up against the wall.</i>

01:20:37.665 --> 01:20:40.691
I got a phone call from Mark Rosenthal
today, remember him?

01:20:40.801 --> 01:20:41.859
Book editor?

01:20:41.936 --> 01:20:43.369
Bob Geldof with a crew cut.

01:20:43.437 --> 01:20:46.895
He's been reading your Nathaniel stuff,
thinks it's genius, whatever.

01:20:46.974 --> 01:20:50.933
- Whatever.
- Anyway. He said it's a book.

01:20:51.712 --> 01:20:53.236
What did he say exactly?

01:20:53.314 --> 01:20:57.546
"It's personal, it's political, it's timely.
I can sell the shit out of it. "

01:20:57.618 --> 01:21:00.416
- Oh, boy.
- His words, excuse me, not mine.

01:21:00.487 --> 01:21:03.320
Well, it's complicated.
Nathaniel's complicated.

01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:06.052
Well, yeah, he's mentally ill, I mean.

01:21:07.795 --> 01:21:10.457
Right. But beyond that, it's endless.

01:21:10.531 --> 01:21:12.761
I just...
I don't want to take full responsibility.

01:21:12.833 --> 01:21:15.358
By all means, avoid full responsibility.

01:21:15.436 --> 01:21:17.961
Just, you know, keep going
with the partial responsibility

01:21:18.038 --> 01:21:21.201
and exploiting him
like you are now.

01:21:21.275 --> 01:21:22.264
You should stop.

01:21:22.343 --> 01:21:23.435
'Cause that's a slippery slope
right there,

01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:24.602
Lopez.

01:21:24.678 --> 01:21:26.441
- Stop. Stop.
- One day, you're getting a book...

01:21:26.513 --> 01:21:28.242
- Please stop.
... from the guy. And the next,

01:21:28.315 --> 01:21:29.339
he's expecting, I don't know,
some sort of...

01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:30.508
Mary, stop.

01:21:30.584 --> 01:21:33.576
...consistency in the relationship.
Screw that, man.

01:21:33.654 --> 01:21:37.055
Who needs that shit, right? My words.

01:21:37.124 --> 01:21:39.058
- You driving?
- No, I have a car.

01:21:39.126 --> 01:21:40.559
And a driver?

01:21:42.663 --> 01:21:44.893
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

01:21:44.999 --> 01:21:47.092
It's Nathaniel for you.

01:21:48.969 --> 01:21:51.164
<i>...as a youngster labeled mentally ill</i>

01:21:51.238 --> 01:21:53.206
<i>because of the underlying
cigarette habit,</i>

01:21:53.273 --> 01:21:55.036
<i>constant disturbance,
constant disturbance.</i>

01:21:55.109 --> 01:21:56.940
<i>You know, bigots have children, too.</i>

01:21:57.011 --> 01:21:58.774
<i>Pens from Steve Lopez. Many thanks.</i>

01:21:58.846 --> 01:22:01.280
<i>Constant disturbance,
constant disturbance.</i>

01:22:01.348 --> 01:22:03.373
<i>Bigots have children.
Bigots have children, too.</i>

01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:06.977
<i>Pens... Paper...
Pens from Steve Lopez. Many thanks.</i>

01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:13.619
<i>And a cello from Steve Lopez.
Steve Lopez... Many thanks to that.</i>

01:22:13.694 --> 01:22:17.289
<i>Without Steve Lopez,
I wouldn't have any of that...</i>

01:22:17.364 --> 01:22:18.991
<i>Constant disturbance.</i>

01:22:19.066 --> 01:22:22.035
<i>Constant disturbance.
Constant disturbances.</i>

01:22:22.302 --> 01:22:25.271
<i>I've had what I think is a beautiful idea.</i>

01:22:25.339 --> 01:22:28.137
<i>I think Nathaniel should give a recital.</i>

01:22:28.976 --> 01:22:32.571
I don't know if I can make that call.
He hasn't been very lucid lately.

01:22:32.646 --> 01:22:34.876
<i>- Right. When is he clearest?
- I don't...</i>

01:22:34.948 --> 01:22:37.382
<i>When is he most able
to focus his thoughts?</i>

01:22:37.451 --> 01:22:39.476
<i>- When he's playing.
- Right.</i>

01:22:39.987 --> 01:22:42.751
This could increase his confidence
a thousand fold.

01:22:42.823 --> 01:22:44.620
It could be transformative.

01:22:44.692 --> 01:22:47.217
<i>How can we not give him that, Steve?</i>

01:22:50.297 --> 01:22:52.060
God bless you, Steve.

01:22:53.534 --> 01:22:55.001
Sure he does.

01:23:08.549 --> 01:23:14.385
My first concert, I was so nervous,
I vomited all down my tuxedo.

01:23:14.455 --> 01:23:16.821
It was so embarrassing.

01:23:19.226 --> 01:23:22.559
Want to know how I got over
those jitters, Nathaniel?

01:23:23.597 --> 01:23:24.859
I prayed.

01:23:26.133 --> 01:23:28.567
Shall we pray together, you and I?

01:23:30.304 --> 01:23:31.931
Heavenly Father,

01:23:32.439 --> 01:23:34.703
shine your light on brother Nathaniel,

01:23:34.775 --> 01:23:38.040
that he may speak
with your voice tonight.

01:24:35.435 --> 01:24:39.701
<i>Nathaniel, you never have been here,
Nathaniel. I'm here, Nathaniel.</i>

01:24:39.773 --> 01:24:41.764
<i>- You're not there.
- Nathaniel.</i>

01:24:41.842 --> 01:24:45.039
<i>You never have been here.
You never will be here.</i>

01:24:47.447 --> 01:24:48.709
<i>My voice is all there is.</i>

01:24:48.782 --> 01:24:50.340
Everything's fine.

01:24:50.417 --> 01:24:51.748
<i>- Follow my voice, Nathaniel.
- Tune up and play.</i>

01:24:51.819 --> 01:24:52.979
<i>Run away from these people, Nathaniel.</i>

01:24:53.053 --> 01:24:54.179
<i>They'll laugh at you.</i>

01:24:54.254 --> 01:24:55.881
<i>- You're nothing.
- Nathaniel Ayers.</i>

01:25:06.967 --> 01:25:08.400
Nathaniel?

01:25:10.337 --> 01:25:12.532
I got some soup here for you.

01:25:35.562 --> 01:25:36.927
Nathaniel?

01:25:38.065 --> 01:25:40.533
You think I'm stupid.
Is that what you think?

01:25:40.601 --> 01:25:43.729
<i>You want to kill them, Nathaniel.
They'll kill you first, Nathaniel.</i>

01:25:43.804 --> 01:25:44.828
No.

01:25:44.905 --> 01:25:46.429
<i>They'll string you up, Nathaniel.</i>

01:25:46.506 --> 01:25:49.304
No. You think I can't see everything.
I see everything.

01:25:49.376 --> 01:25:51.276
I know who you are.
I know what you're doing.

01:25:51.345 --> 01:25:52.812
<i>- Dogs, biting at your feet.
- Nathaniel.</i>

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.939
<i>- I thought you might be hungry.
- Nathaniel, over there.</i>

01:25:55.015 --> 01:25:58.576
<i>- The dusty open manual.
- Nathaniel, come here.</i>

01:25:58.652 --> 01:25:59.812
<i>The manual.</i>

01:25:59.887 --> 01:26:03.254
That's hydrochloric acid. If I eat that, it'll
burn me up inside and kill me like a dog.

01:26:03.323 --> 01:26:05.188
<i>- Oh, no.
- Nathaniel.</i>

01:26:05.259 --> 01:26:07.489
<i>- Nathaniel, I wouldn't do that.
- Nathaniel.</i>

01:26:08.362 --> 01:26:11.491
<i>Nathaniel.</i>

01:26:13.033 --> 01:26:15.126
<i>You'll eat it, dust and all.</i>

01:26:16.203 --> 01:26:17.363
Okay.

01:26:18.171 --> 01:26:19.832
It's good, see.

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:30.978
Shit.

01:26:36.023 --> 01:26:37.115
Don't put your hands on me!

01:26:37.190 --> 01:26:39.055
- Nathaniel!
- Back the hell off!

01:26:39.126 --> 01:26:41.720
Don't you ever touch me!
Don't ever put your hands on me!

01:26:41.795 --> 01:26:44.093
Please, don't. Nathaniel.

01:26:47.467 --> 01:26:48.661
Don't you ever touch me.

01:26:48.735 --> 01:26:49.827
Stop.

01:27:02.616 --> 01:27:03.981
Nathaniel!

01:27:15.028 --> 01:27:18.987
What am I supposed to do?
I should have support.

01:27:29.443 --> 01:27:30.967
Hi, Nathaniel.

01:27:34.047 --> 01:27:37.448
It's freezing out here.
Don't you wanna come home?

01:27:37.517 --> 01:27:39.712
I can't go back there. It's not safe.

01:27:39.786 --> 01:27:41.754
Come on, home, Nathaniel.

01:27:47.027 --> 01:27:48.494
Nathaniel?

01:27:49.563 --> 01:27:51.531
Where are you gonna sleep?

01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:04.003
David, sorry, it's Steve. Listen.

01:28:04.745 --> 01:28:07.236
Can you call me back
when you have a second?

01:28:07.314 --> 01:28:10.545
There was an incident
with Nathaniel tonight. I'm a little

01:28:11.518 --> 01:28:14.578
worried. Anyway, call back
when you have a sec.

01:28:18.358 --> 01:28:19.825
All right, let's go.

01:28:30.337 --> 01:28:34.637
It's my thing!
I claim my right to those possessions!

01:28:34.708 --> 01:28:36.437
Show me your stuff!

01:28:39.813 --> 01:28:41.371
- Linda!
- What?

01:28:41.448 --> 01:28:43.541
- Hey, where's Nathaniel?
- I don't know. I haven't seen him.

01:28:43.617 --> 01:28:45.778
- I haven't seen him.
- Hey! Hey!

01:28:46.119 --> 01:28:47.643
Is it Darryl?

01:28:47.721 --> 01:28:48.881
Hey, stay back. Who the hell are you?

01:28:48.955 --> 01:28:51.617
<i>LA Times. That's the last guy
you should be arresting.</i>

01:28:51.691 --> 01:28:53.750
- Come on, man! Come on.
- Skid row cleanup, sir. Let's go.

01:28:53.827 --> 01:28:54.919
Steve! Steve!

01:28:54.995 --> 01:28:57.828
This man is in illegal possession
of a shopping cart and a milk crate.

01:28:57.898 --> 01:28:59.832
Are you gonna arrest him
for possession of a milk crate?

01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:02.391
- Steve! Steve!
- That's correct, sir.

01:29:05.005 --> 01:29:06.472
Take it easy.

01:29:07.441 --> 01:29:09.375
Help! Help!

01:29:18.418 --> 01:29:19.817
<i>Come on!</i>

01:29:20.353 --> 01:29:21.843
Officer, what happened?

01:29:21.922 --> 01:29:24.152
A couple of kids came out here
with some baseball bats

01:29:24.224 --> 01:29:25.623
and beat the shit out of this poor guy.

01:29:25.692 --> 01:29:27.785
- Get a name?
- Negative, sir.

01:29:33.633 --> 01:29:35.760
Sorry, excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:29:37.804 --> 01:29:42.400
Is this Admits? May I make
an enquiry about a... Excuse me.

01:29:42.742 --> 01:29:44.334
- This way?
- What?

01:29:44.411 --> 01:29:45.571
Yeah, down here.

01:29:45.645 --> 01:29:48.910
It's usually on the... I'm sorry.
It's usually on the screen.

01:29:49.649 --> 01:29:53.346
Excuse me, ma'am. Recent ER
admits named Ayers, A-Y-E-R-S.

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:55.417
Thank you, by the way.

01:29:56.857 --> 01:29:57.983
No.

01:29:59.059 --> 01:30:00.856
Hi. Thank you.

01:30:00.927 --> 01:30:03.589
I'm looking for a recent admission.

01:30:03.663 --> 01:30:07.099
I'm hoping you have a recent admission
with a man named Ayers, A-Y-E-R-S.

01:30:07.501 --> 01:30:11.198
I know. Contreras was the reporting
officer. He was the officer on site.

01:30:12.939 --> 01:30:14.873
It's not the... It's not the...

01:30:18.545 --> 01:30:20.342
Mr. Ayers. A-Y-E-R-S.

01:30:20.413 --> 01:30:23.314
Nathaniel Anthony Ayers.
5'10" African-American.

01:30:23.617 --> 01:30:25.050
Hi. It's me again.

01:30:25.585 --> 01:30:27.177
It's gonna be a long shift.
What's your name?

01:30:27.487 --> 01:30:30.081
N- A-T-H-A-N-I-E-L A...

01:30:31.358 --> 01:30:33.121
I do words for a living. It doesn't matter.

01:30:33.193 --> 01:30:34.751
Whoever has two stripes
on their arm or more.

01:30:34.828 --> 01:30:37.262
Ayers! A-Y-E-R-S.

01:30:37.330 --> 01:30:42.529
N- A-T-H-A-N-I-E-L
A- N-T-H-O-N-Y A-Y-E-R-S.

01:30:42.702 --> 01:30:44.499
No! Do not put me on hold again!

01:30:44.571 --> 01:30:48.132
A- Y-E-R-S!

01:31:12.532 --> 01:31:14.727
<i>- Lopez.
- Steve, David.</i>

01:31:14.801 --> 01:31:17.133
<i>I got your message, what's up?</i>

01:31:17.204 --> 01:31:20.105
There was a beating of a homeless man
on Winston Street,

01:31:20.173 --> 01:31:23.006
<i>- it was right in Nathaniel's spot.
- It wasn't him.</i>

01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:25.236
What? How do you know?

01:31:25.312 --> 01:31:29.271
'Cause he's here,
eating a crazy-big breakfast.

01:31:30.283 --> 01:31:33.548
I guess sleeping inside
can give a man an appetite.

01:31:34.421 --> 01:31:35.718
What?

01:31:35.789 --> 01:31:38.257
<i>He spent last night in the apartment.</i>

01:31:39.359 --> 01:31:40.917
<i>He came inside.</i>

01:31:59.546 --> 01:32:00.774
Thank you.

01:32:00.847 --> 01:32:04.180
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:32:04.351 --> 01:32:06.478
I thought I lost it forever.

01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:07.878
Hi.

01:32:09.489 --> 01:32:10.751
You good?

01:32:14.294 --> 01:32:18.321
I literally looked everywhere else
in Los Angeles but here.

01:32:19.966 --> 01:32:21.831
Not that I was worried.

01:32:22.335 --> 01:32:24.326
What happened? What made you
decide to sleep in here?

01:32:24.404 --> 01:32:27.931
Oh, well, a body can only take
so much, Mr. Lopez.

01:32:28.008 --> 01:32:30.841
I'm not young anymore,
I'm a middle-aged man.

01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:32.935
- You know how it is.
- Sure.

01:32:34.914 --> 01:32:36.575
I mean, a body gets weary, a body...

01:32:36.650 --> 01:32:38.379
Housewarming gift.

01:32:48.728 --> 01:32:50.457
Thank you, Mr. Lopez.

01:32:52.666 --> 01:32:55.897
Thank you, Mr. Lopez. Thank you.

01:33:01.274 --> 01:33:03.640
I've done good by you, haven't I?

01:33:04.144 --> 01:33:06.635
I mean, things aren't so bad, right?

01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:15.250
Say, things are set for Jennifer
to become your executor.

01:33:15.322 --> 01:33:18.917
I can't believe Beethoven himself
is in my own apartment.

01:33:19.359 --> 01:33:22.192
Are you still okay with that?
Having Jennifer handle things for you?

01:33:22.262 --> 01:33:24.253
It's all right with me
if it's all right with Beethoven.

01:33:24.331 --> 01:33:26.424
Well, you guys let me know.

01:33:27.967 --> 01:33:31.926
'Cause there's papers you gotta sign.
They just got back from...

01:33:32.505 --> 01:33:35.201
You should read them
so you know what you're signing.

01:33:35.275 --> 01:33:37.869
All right, yeah, I'll just sign them
Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, Jr.,

01:33:37.944 --> 01:33:41.937
apartment B-116, and the B stands for

01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:45.217
Beethoven.

01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:48.847
- Read them and sign them.
- All right.

01:33:48.922 --> 01:33:49.980
- Okay.
- All right.

01:33:50.056 --> 01:33:51.614
What do you...
You got anything to drink?

01:33:51.691 --> 01:33:54.285
Yes, sir, Mr. Lopez.
Absolutely, Mr. Lopez,

01:33:54.361 --> 01:33:58.855
help yourself to some water, it's where
the dripping sound is coming from.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.927
- At your leisure.
- All right.

01:34:12.178 --> 01:34:13.543
Is there a...

01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:18.875
What's with Neil Diamond?

01:34:18.952 --> 01:34:20.852
I thought that was you.

01:34:28.995 --> 01:34:31.987
Well, I'm flattered.
He's a good-looking guy.

01:34:34.601 --> 01:34:36.091
What's wrong?

01:34:38.004 --> 01:34:40.199
What's this business about me

01:34:40.573 --> 01:34:44.009
having a schizophrenic mind?

01:34:46.079 --> 01:34:47.603
It's, it's... It's legal jargon.

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:51.047
It says that I have a schizophrenic mind.
I do not.

01:34:51.117 --> 01:34:52.277
It doesn't mean anything.

01:34:52.352 --> 01:34:55.810
- I have a schizophrenic mind.
- That's not what I think.

01:34:56.122 --> 01:34:58.716
Nathaniel, they try to put people in a...

01:34:58.792 --> 01:35:00.589
- I'm not going anywhere.
- And the good news is that

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:02.594
it has nothing to do with you.

01:35:02.662 --> 01:35:05.529
I don't go where you say to go.
I go where I want to go.

01:35:05.598 --> 01:35:07.725
You don't put me away, Mr. Lopez.
You don't put me away.

01:35:07.801 --> 01:35:09.200
- Okay. Okay.
- You don't put me away.

01:35:09.269 --> 01:35:10.293
I'm not gonna... I don't...

01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:12.167
- No, no, you don't have to go...
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

01:35:12.238 --> 01:35:13.330
...to court.
You don't have to go anywhere.

01:35:13.406 --> 01:35:14.805
Jennifer will take care of you.

01:35:14.874 --> 01:35:16.899
My sister's not coming near me.
She is not coming near me.

01:35:16.976 --> 01:35:18.876
- She's not coming near me.
- Okay, remember when you said...

01:35:18.945 --> 01:35:20.242
If I say she's not coming
then she's not coming.

01:35:20.313 --> 01:35:22.474
You said... Nathaniel, you said...

01:35:22.549 --> 01:35:24.983
Listen, I'm not going to have anymore...
I'm not going to have anymore...

01:35:25.051 --> 01:35:28.612
I will tell you. I will tell you. I'm sick
of being Nathaniel and you Mr. Lopez.

01:35:28.688 --> 01:35:29.848
Okay. I'm not just...

01:35:29.923 --> 01:35:32.619
Wait. I'm not your boy.
I am not Mr. Colonel Sanders's boy.

01:35:32.692 --> 01:35:35.661
You know, I'm sorry I was wrong.
I'm sorry I was wrong.

01:35:35.728 --> 01:35:39.789
I can take care of myself.
I can take care of myself, Mr. Lopez.

01:35:39.866 --> 01:35:44.701
I don't need you. I don't need this city.
I despise this city and I despise you.

01:35:47.707 --> 01:35:49.834
And if I ever see you again,

01:35:51.044 --> 01:35:52.739
I'll cut you open

01:35:53.713 --> 01:35:55.704
and gut you like a fish.

01:36:05.892 --> 01:36:09.453
Because I'm Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Jr.

01:36:10.864 --> 01:36:13.492
Mr. Ayers.

01:36:16.202 --> 01:36:20.229
I'm Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Jr.
N- A-T-H-A...

01:36:24.811 --> 01:36:26.244
N- A-T-H-A...

01:36:26.312 --> 01:36:31.951
<i>- N-A-T-H-A...
- You're of no consequence.</i>

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:48.629
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:37:18.064 --> 01:37:20.328
So, that was my first mistake.

01:37:25.405 --> 01:37:27.896
The Northridge Quake, '94, remember?

01:37:28.508 --> 01:37:30.203
I smelled the toast.

01:37:33.713 --> 01:37:35.681
We'd been here two days.

01:37:36.916 --> 01:37:39.077
All our crap still in boxes.

01:37:39.152 --> 01:37:40.915
And at 4:00 a. m. It hit.

01:37:41.588 --> 01:37:43.249
God, that terror.

01:37:47.427 --> 01:37:50.123
You, me and Thomas.
What was he, nine?

01:37:50.530 --> 01:37:55.229
All huddled
under that bedroom door frame.

01:37:55.568 --> 01:37:57.832
I told him it was a good omen.

01:38:00.974 --> 01:38:03.204
Welcoming us to our new life.

01:38:04.077 --> 01:38:05.476
Better life.

01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:08.442
In LA.

01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:24.757
I should have had us
on the first flight back to Philly.

01:38:35.775 --> 01:38:37.970
I thought I was helping someone.

01:38:39.145 --> 01:38:41.409
And it was a guy who's got a gift.

01:38:41.481 --> 01:38:43.813
He's lost his way. I'm gonna...

01:38:49.088 --> 01:38:52.387
Inevitably backfired.

01:38:53.059 --> 01:38:55.050
He's backlashed to the...

01:38:57.130 --> 01:39:02.124
And the very person I was trying to be of
some redeeming service to turns on me.

01:39:02.869 --> 01:39:05.667
I'm the enemy. You know?

01:39:08.608 --> 01:39:09.905
A stranger.

01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:12.470
And...

01:39:13.946 --> 01:39:16.574
I don't know who to fault.

01:39:16.649 --> 01:39:21.848
I can't see any outcome to support.

01:39:26.559 --> 01:39:29.187
Can't believe in anything worthwhile.

01:39:33.066 --> 01:39:36.433
Done trying. I resign. I resign.

01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:39.031
From everything.

01:39:39.639 --> 01:39:41.607
It's... It's official.

01:39:49.315 --> 01:39:51.715
You couldn't stop that earthquake.

01:39:57.223 --> 01:40:00.420
You can't fix LA in just...

01:40:02.128 --> 01:40:04.756
And you're never gonna cure Nathaniel.

01:40:10.036 --> 01:40:12.596
Just be his friend and show up.

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.650
Good? I'll be right here if you need me.

01:41:49.068 --> 01:41:51.036
...go, next to the gold store.

01:41:51.103 --> 01:41:53.833
You know what I mean.
He wanted to drink and everything.

01:41:53.906 --> 01:41:56.101
Okay, okay, okay. Bitch, slow down.

01:41:56.976 --> 01:42:01.106
Do you still love me?
Like you did at the start?

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:02.909
I ain't playing with you.

01:42:02.982 --> 01:42:05.075
I'm saying I do.

01:42:05.151 --> 01:42:07.847
It means you and me together forever.

01:42:09.655 --> 01:42:13.523
So that's why I'm saying I do.

01:42:15.027 --> 01:42:18.360
- I love you, Lois.
- I love you, too, Darryl.

01:42:21.133 --> 01:42:24.660
Disguise himself now as...

01:42:24.737 --> 01:42:29.504
They disguise themselves...
Where is Los Angeles?

01:42:29.976 --> 01:42:31.773
Cleveland?

01:42:35.147 --> 01:42:36.444
And...

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.930
We...

01:43:08.581 --> 01:43:10.742
We had some life, didn't we?

01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:15.751
Yeah.

01:43:16.789 --> 01:43:18.017
Yeah.

01:44:02.568 --> 01:44:05.162
<i>Beethoven's Triple Concerto, right?</i>

01:44:05.671 --> 01:44:07.536
- Yeah.
- It's a good one.

01:44:09.875 --> 01:44:11.103
I liked it.

01:44:11.544 --> 01:44:15.480
Mr. Ayers, I'm gonna give your sister
a ride to the hotel.

01:44:15.548 --> 01:44:18.073
You don't have to
call me that, Mr. Lopez.

01:44:18.150 --> 01:44:22.177
I know. I want to. I should have been
calling you that all along.

01:44:22.822 --> 01:44:24.756
I said such terrible things
to you, Mr. Lopez.

01:44:24.824 --> 01:44:28.590
I... I hate myself for saying those things.

01:44:28.661 --> 01:44:31.152
Sometimes friends piss
each other off, right?

01:44:31.230 --> 01:44:33.095
It's part of the deal.

01:44:33.532 --> 01:44:39.300
I can't imagine that you would want to be
my friend after I said all those things.

01:44:39.438 --> 01:44:40.598
I just...

01:44:40.673 --> 01:44:42.004
Mr. Ayers,

01:44:44.276 --> 01:44:46.506
I'm honored to be your friend.

01:45:06.632 --> 01:45:08.691
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

01:45:09.468 --> 01:45:12.062
<i>A year ago, I met a man
who was down on his luck</i>

01:45:12.138 --> 01:45:14.971
<i>and thought I might be able to help him.</i>

01:45:15.041 --> 01:45:17.009
<i>I don't know that I have.</i>

01:45:17.376 --> 01:45:19.742
<i>Yes, my friend Mr. Ayers
now sleeps inside.</i>

01:45:19.812 --> 01:45:22.372
<i>He has a key. He has a bed.</i>

01:45:23.516 --> 01:45:26.212
<i>But his mental state, and his well-being,</i>

01:45:26.285 --> 01:45:29.516
<i>are as precarious now
as they were the day we met.</i>

01:45:32.925 --> 01:45:35.723
<i>There are people who tell me
I've helped him.</i>

01:45:35.795 --> 01:45:38.059
<i>Mental health experts who say</i>

01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:42.430
<i>that the simple act of being someone's
friend can change his brain chemistry,</i>

01:45:42.501 --> 01:45:45.129
<i>improve his functioning in the world.</i>

01:45:45.905 --> 01:45:48.806
<i>I can't speak for Mr. Ayers
in that regard.</i>

01:45:49.075 --> 01:45:52.340
<i>Maybe our friendship has helped him.
But maybe not.</i>

01:45:54.847 --> 01:45:57.281
<i>I can, however, speak for myself.</i>

01:45:58.117 --> 01:46:01.553
<i>I can tell you that by witnessing

01:46:08.094 --> 01:46:11.860
