WEBVTT

00:00.977 --> 00:02.679
Over 68 million Americans

00:02.725 --> 00:05.056
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:05.156 --> 00:06.890
If danger strikes,

00:06.953 --> 00:09.699
the FBI's International Response Team

00:09.832 --> 00:11.486
is called into action.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.074

00:20.788 --> 00:22.415
Welcome to Mexico, señor.

00:39.426 --> 00:41.326
All you hear about growing on San Diego

00:41.328 --> 00:42.728
is how dangerous T.J. is.

00:42.730 --> 00:45.030
But all... I mean, this place rocks!

00:45.032 --> 00:46.932
Oh. Thanks for inviting me.

00:46.934 --> 00:49.568
You only turn 18 once. We
might as well do it right.

00:49.570 --> 00:51.203
True that. And about time

00:51.205 --> 00:53.338
you finally invited
me down here with you.

00:53.340 --> 00:55.107
You know, I was waiting
for the right time.

00:55.109 --> 00:58.410
I wanted you to have
the best experience ever.

00:58.412 --> 01:00.479
Well, speaking of...

01:00.481 --> 01:02.314
Look what I got.

01:02.316 --> 01:03.749
Where the hell did you get that?

01:03.751 --> 01:06.552
This guy was passed out in the
bathroom with it in his hand.

01:06.554 --> 01:07.553
Whoa, hey!

01:07.555 --> 01:08.854
You need to slow down.

01:08.856 --> 01:10.422
- You're crazy.
- No way!

01:10.424 --> 01:17.262
I'm in T.J. with my best
friend, and I'm ready to party!

01:19.800 --> 01:21.633
Oh.

01:23.270 --> 01:24.269
It's okay.

01:24.271 --> 01:25.070
Oh.

01:26.974 --> 01:28.273
Breathe.

01:28.275 --> 01:30.542
It's almost over. You're okay.

01:31.445 --> 01:33.779
Oh.

01:39.286 --> 01:40.953
Roxy?

01:42.723 --> 01:45.527
Promise you're not gonna
tell anyone at school.

01:46.093 --> 01:47.759
Roxy?

01:52.299 --> 01:54.233
Roxy?

02:00.708 --> 02:02.741
Roxy?

02:03.711 --> 02:05.844
This isn't funny.

02:08.649 --> 02:10.846
If you're trying to
scare me, it's working.

02:11.552 --> 02:13.418
What?

02:21.795 --> 02:23.695
Lee Kern, an 18-year-old
high school senior

02:23.697 --> 02:26.431
from San Diego, California,
was identified as the victim

02:26.433 --> 02:28.166
when Federales found his cellphone

02:28.168 --> 02:30.002
still in his possession
in Delgado Square

02:30.004 --> 02:31.803
completely covered in red paint.

02:31.805 --> 02:33.672
They immediately contacted
the U.S. Consulate,

02:33.674 --> 02:35.107
who, in turn, asked for our help.

02:35.109 --> 02:36.508
What's the preliminary C.O.D.?

02:36.510 --> 02:38.677
It's hard to tell
with all the red paint,

02:38.679 --> 02:41.413
but his neck was sliced at the carotid.

02:41.415 --> 02:43.048
Religious iconography aside,

02:43.050 --> 02:44.316
do you think there's a message here?

02:44.318 --> 02:46.451
Persecuting him for his
sins, making him a martyr.

02:46.453 --> 02:48.020
Martyr or not, it's clearly someone

02:48.022 --> 02:49.087
wanting to make a statement.

02:49.089 --> 02:50.589
Yeah, whoever it was, they weren't shy.

02:50.591 --> 02:52.157
Agreed. The hanging in a public area

02:52.159 --> 02:54.359
and the red paint scream
someone is looking for attention.

02:54.361 --> 02:57.362
Yeah, but from whom?
Cops, locals, tourists?

02:57.364 --> 02:59.431
Jack, seems Lee wasn't alone.

02:59.433 --> 03:01.233
Border patrols sent this.

03:01.235 --> 03:03.669
Meet Roxy Bental... also
18... A classmate of Lee's.

03:03.671 --> 03:04.937
Boyfriend-girlfriend?

03:04.939 --> 03:07.439
Yeah, from the look of
Lee's social media page,

03:07.441 --> 03:11.476
more like friends ringing in
Lee's 18th birthday T.J. style.

03:11.478 --> 03:13.679
Yeah, road-tripping there
is like a rite of passage

03:13.681 --> 03:15.714
for American kids since
the drinking at is 18.

03:15.716 --> 03:17.769
Yeah, but most kids return home safely,

03:17.824 --> 03:19.284
like Roxy did last night.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.086
Border Patrol has he crossing

03:21.088 --> 03:23.355
back into the U.S. at 11:43 P.M.

03:23.357 --> 03:24.389
So Lee ends up dead,

03:24.391 --> 03:26.258
and Roxy skips back across the border.

03:26.260 --> 03:27.426
Does that smell funny to you guys?

03:27.428 --> 03:29.328
About to get stinkier, actually.

03:29.330 --> 03:31.063
Roxy has a SENTRI card.

03:31.065 --> 03:32.497
Isn't that for frequent border-crossers?

03:32.499 --> 03:35.133
Yes, it's issued by U.S.
Customs to U.S. citizens

03:35.135 --> 03:36.835
for quicker crossing in
and out of the country.

03:36.837 --> 03:40.038
Seems Roxy not only made the
pilgrimage to T.J. weekly,

03:40.040 --> 03:42.140
each time, it's with a different guy

03:42.142 --> 03:43.675
as you can see here.

03:43.677 --> 03:45.277
So why would a teen
girl go back and forth

03:45.279 --> 03:46.244
over the border so often?

03:46.246 --> 03:47.346
Maybe she's a drug mule.

03:47.348 --> 03:48.380
Well, as long as there's demand,

03:48.382 --> 03:49.448
this is gonna keep happening.

03:49.450 --> 03:51.817
I mean, there were 843
drug-related murders

03:51.819 --> 03:53.285
of foreigners in Mexico last year.

03:53.287 --> 03:55.053
So did these kids get
mixed up in the drug trade?

03:55.055 --> 03:56.088
Once we're on the ground,

03:56.090 --> 03:58.056
Simmons and I will
check the crime scene.

03:58.058 --> 03:59.624
Mae, you take a look at the Vic.

03:59.626 --> 04:02.027
Clara, you have a chat with Roxy.

04:02.029 --> 04:04.129
We're not about to let the
murder of an 18-year-old

04:04.131 --> 04:06.732
high school student go unpunished.

04:26.976 --> 04:29.778
There's an old Mexican
expression that says,

04:29.780 --> 04:31.479
They tried to bury us.

04:31.481 --> 04:33.815
They didn't know we were seeds.

04:42.125 --> 04:43.625
I talked to Officer Calderon.

04:43.627 --> 04:46.027
He said they lost six
officers in the past month.

04:46.029 --> 04:47.662
Well, the cartels, they I.D. officers

04:47.664 --> 04:48.830
coming to and from crime scenes,

04:48.832 --> 04:50.165
they target them for investigating.

04:50.167 --> 04:52.267
And sometimes their families.

04:52.269 --> 04:54.502
You see why the masks are
a necessary precaution.

04:54.504 --> 04:56.304
Mm-hmm.

04:57.541 --> 04:59.774
I'm Officer Roberto
Calderon. Gracias for coming.

04:59.776 --> 05:00.582
Matt Simmons.

05:00.591 --> 05:01.684
Thanks for having us.

05:01.690 --> 05:03.557
Local store owner saw
the body this morning

05:03.814 --> 05:05.146
while opening up.

05:05.148 --> 05:07.449
So how did no one notice
a body being strung up

05:07.451 --> 05:08.984
in a popular place like this?

05:08.986 --> 05:11.753
Even Delgado Square slows
down for a small window of time

05:11.755 --> 05:12.754
between night and day.

05:12.756 --> 05:14.823
Whoever did this must have known that.

05:14.825 --> 05:16.458
Might even live around here.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.326
It's not easy getting
a body up that high.

05:18.328 --> 05:20.595
Corpse with a slit-open neck
would have painted this tree

05:20.597 --> 05:22.897
and everything underneath it with blood.

05:22.899 --> 05:24.366
Yeah, or it would have bled dry.

05:24.368 --> 05:25.367
But there's none of that here.

05:25.369 --> 05:27.068
This isn't the original crime scene.

05:27.070 --> 05:28.403
The question is where's the primary,

05:28.405 --> 05:29.804
and who would be brazen
enough to do this?

05:29.806 --> 05:32.073
All the roads in Mexico
lead to the cartels.

05:32.075 --> 05:33.875
Whoever this kid was, he unfortunately

05:33.877 --> 05:36.111
came across them, did
something to piss them off,

05:36.113 --> 05:37.379
and paid the price.

05:41.318 --> 05:43.118
Are you aware that the FBI believes

05:43.120 --> 05:45.954
you're smuggling drugs from
Mexico into the United States?

05:45.956 --> 05:48.323
Because I am. And I
stand by my conviction.

05:48.325 --> 05:49.391
I'm not a puppet

05:49.393 --> 05:51.326
of the United States
of Special Interests.

05:51.328 --> 05:53.028
What are you talking about?

05:53.030 --> 05:55.163
The pharmaceutical companies
might have you and the feds

05:55.165 --> 05:57.332
in their back pocket, but not me.

05:57.334 --> 05:59.601
So you're not smuggling
recreational drugs.

05:59.603 --> 06:02.737
No. No, no, I'm not a criminal.

06:02.739 --> 06:04.773
I'm an entrepreneur. I
provide a much-needed service

06:04.775 --> 06:07.676
for senior citizens who can't
afford prescription meds.

06:07.678 --> 06:09.844
So you're buying
prescription meds in Mexico,

06:09.846 --> 06:11.613
bringing them into
America, for what reason,

06:11.615 --> 06:13.048
out of the kindness of your heart?

06:13.050 --> 06:15.050
No. But I'm charging
pennies on the dollar

06:15.052 --> 06:16.918
compared to what Big Brother charges.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.353
Hmm.

06:18.355 --> 06:20.555
And all the different
boys who follow you there

06:20.557 --> 06:22.290
and tag along, do they
get a small percentage

06:22.292 --> 06:24.159
- of your up charge?
- No.

06:24.161 --> 06:25.593
Then why bring them?

06:25.595 --> 06:27.562
Because every frat boy
with his liquid courage

06:27.564 --> 06:29.964
has a tendency to hit on me,
and if I've got some arm candy,

06:29.966 --> 06:31.166
they tend to leave me alone.

06:31.168 --> 06:34.102
And what about Lee? Did he
know why you invited him?

06:34.104 --> 06:35.637
Of course not.

06:35.639 --> 06:37.172
But he was having such a good time

06:37.174 --> 06:39.407
until he ran off on me.

06:39.409 --> 06:40.475
Ran off?

06:40.477 --> 06:42.243
Yeah, he was blowing chunks.

06:43.313 --> 06:44.612
And so I told him I'd
be back in a minute,

06:44.614 --> 06:47.949
I covered him with my
jacket, and then I ran off.

06:47.951 --> 06:50.652
When I got back, he'd
gotten up and split.

06:50.654 --> 06:51.920
Why did you leave him?

06:51.922 --> 06:53.455
'Cause the pharmacies were closing.

06:53.457 --> 06:55.356
And I've got customers
with serious health issues

06:55.358 --> 06:57.125
that can't afford to
miss their daily dose.

06:57.127 --> 07:00.462
Knowing Lee, he stumbled back
home and is sleeping it off.

07:00.464 --> 07:02.997
Lee is dead.

07:02.999 --> 07:04.664
What?

07:05.469 --> 07:07.352
No, that's impossible.

07:08.105 --> 07:09.404
You're lying.

07:09.406 --> 07:11.406
I wish that I was.

07:11.408 --> 07:12.674
Listen, I need you to think.

07:12.676 --> 07:14.709
Is there anything he
could have done or said

07:14.711 --> 07:16.911
that would have led someone
to want to murder him?

07:16.913 --> 07:19.380
Murder?

07:19.382 --> 07:20.663
No.

07:21.328 --> 07:24.652
No, not that I can think of.
We were just having a good time.

07:25.956 --> 07:27.422
No, he did say that there was a guy

07:27.424 --> 07:28.490
passed out in the bathroom

07:28.492 --> 07:30.492
with a bag of coke in his hand.

07:30.494 --> 07:31.359
Lee took it.

07:31.361 --> 07:32.293
How much coke?

07:32.295 --> 07:33.328
I don't know.

07:33.330 --> 07:35.730
Like, um, a sandwich bag full.

07:35.732 --> 07:36.865
I threw it out.

07:36.867 --> 07:38.937
That can go for a pretty
penny on the streets.

07:39.336 --> 07:41.218
I need the name of that bar.

07:42.239 --> 07:44.506
Yeah, of course.

07:44.508 --> 07:46.113
Of course.

07:46.576 --> 07:48.824
This is my fault.

07:49.546 --> 07:50.612
This is my fault.

07:50.614 --> 07:51.980
If I hadn't have brought him down there,

07:51.982 --> 07:53.615
then he wouldn't be dead!

08:00.390 --> 08:02.757
Thank you for allowing me to
assist you, Examiner Granado.

08:02.759 --> 08:03.858
I should thank you.

08:03.860 --> 08:05.660
We're so understaffed and overworked.

08:05.662 --> 08:08.663
I can use an extra pair of hands.

08:09.900 --> 08:12.278
After all these years, it's
still not easy to see the dead.

08:13.103 --> 08:14.747
And especially this young.

08:15.272 --> 08:17.252
So much life ahead of him.

08:19.309 --> 08:20.675
Well, the cut is clean.

08:20.677 --> 08:22.877
It's not jagged, so the
blade wouldn't be serrated.

08:22.879 --> 08:24.546
The C.O.D. is an exsanguination due

08:24.548 --> 08:25.680
to the cutting of the carotid.

08:25.682 --> 08:26.648
It was a quick death.

08:26.650 --> 08:28.716
Like the way you bleed an animal.

08:28.718 --> 08:30.954
What kind of blade do we think did this?

08:35.859 --> 08:39.159
The path of the wound
tapers off as if it's curved.

08:39.162 --> 08:40.981
Like what?

08:41.932 --> 08:44.899
When I was a kid, I would
spend my spring breaks

08:44.901 --> 08:47.235
at my grandparents' house,
and they had a garden.

08:47.237 --> 08:49.671
And so I was always there to help plant.

08:49.673 --> 08:52.607
And my job was to cut all of the weeds.

08:52.609 --> 08:57.048
So my grandpa would give me...

08:57.714 --> 08:58.980
this.

08:58.982 --> 09:00.381
A sickle?

09:00.383 --> 09:02.116
Sí.

09:04.788 --> 09:06.721
Can you hand me the tweezers?

09:11.261 --> 09:12.894
Thank you.

09:17.868 --> 09:21.236
It looks like somebody has
been playing in the sand box.

09:31.481 --> 09:34.161
Roxy said she left Lee here.

09:49.699 --> 09:52.033
Arterial spray.

09:53.436 --> 09:56.009
This is our primary crime scene.

09:59.109 --> 10:01.109
There's also a trail of
blood... ends abruptly.

10:01.111 --> 10:04.812
So whoever did this must have
a vehicle they're moving him in.

10:04.814 --> 10:06.648
That explains how they got
Lee's body up in that tree.

10:06.650 --> 10:07.815
Tie a little rope to a bumper,

10:07.817 --> 10:09.150
you got yourself an instant winch.

10:09.152 --> 10:11.085
The owner any help?

10:11.087 --> 10:13.254
He said it's too many
kids come through here

10:13.256 --> 10:15.256
to remember any one face.

10:15.258 --> 10:18.559
He prays that American
kids stop coming down here.

10:18.561 --> 10:20.017
They're too much trouble.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.611
Officer Calderon, we
believe whoever did this

10:22.673 --> 10:25.400
transported the body
in some kind of vehicle.

10:25.402 --> 10:26.634
Unless you got a plate number,

10:26.636 --> 10:28.436
it would be almost
impossible to find it.

10:28.438 --> 10:30.638
We got traffic cameras at the border,

10:30.640 --> 10:32.874
but not across the city.

10:35.378 --> 10:37.612
I've seen this before... La Horca.

10:37.614 --> 10:40.048
Mm-hmm. The Gallows Cartel.

10:40.050 --> 10:41.215
They mark their territory.

10:41.217 --> 10:43.584
Roxy said that Lee
lifted a bag of cocaine

10:43.586 --> 10:45.219
off of some guy who'd
passed out in the bathroom.

10:45.221 --> 10:46.587
What if he was a member of La Horca?

10:46.589 --> 10:48.923
Like I told you, all
roads lead to the cartels.

10:49.859 --> 10:50.992
What do you got, Mae?

10:50.994 --> 10:53.061
Well, the victim's
carotid artery was severed

10:53.063 --> 10:54.562
with a sickle.

10:54.564 --> 10:55.697
A farmer's tool?

10:55.699 --> 10:56.931
Give the man a prize.

10:56.933 --> 10:58.766
Interesting choice of
weapon for the cartels.

10:58.768 --> 11:01.803
I also found some traces
of sand on Lee's body,

11:01.805 --> 11:03.271
a possible secondary transfer.

11:03.273 --> 11:04.639
Sand?

11:04.641 --> 11:07.909
La Horca's one of the cartels
vying for supremacy in T.J.

11:07.911 --> 11:09.577
They love to surf.

11:09.579 --> 11:11.779
Maybe the transfer is
from one of their hangouts

11:11.781 --> 11:12.814
near Aguila Beach.

11:12.816 --> 11:14.182
Great. Let's roll.

11:17.454 --> 11:19.020
I'm sorry, I can't go.

11:19.022 --> 11:20.855
I got called to another crime scene.

11:20.857 --> 11:22.423
Please proceed without me.

11:22.425 --> 11:24.258
I'll catch up when I can.

11:33.657 --> 11:35.610
_

12:07.670 --> 12:09.504
You check the house.

12:11.241 --> 12:12.040
You got this?

12:12.042 --> 12:14.375
Yeah, I'm good.

12:18.415 --> 12:20.615
Uh, psst. Carlos.

12:23.086 --> 12:26.354
Jack Garrett, FBI.

12:34.164 --> 12:35.563
They're a little...

12:35.565 --> 12:36.931
protective of me.

12:36.933 --> 12:38.633
Maybe they have good reason to be.

12:40.003 --> 12:42.036
You got big cojones, my friend.

12:42.038 --> 12:44.372
I'm not your friend.

12:44.374 --> 12:45.673
Seen him?

12:45.675 --> 12:46.808
Why? Did you lose him?

12:46.810 --> 12:48.076
He's dead.

12:48.078 --> 12:49.377
Uh...

12:49.379 --> 12:51.154
Where you been for the last 24 hours?

12:51.193 --> 12:53.114
Right here, partying.

12:53.116 --> 12:56.113
With plenty of witnesses
to support my alibi.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.486
House is clean.

12:58.488 --> 13:00.054
What about the sand?

13:00.056 --> 13:02.824
Scraped this off one
of the boards inside.

13:02.826 --> 13:05.393
Can I offer you guys a beer?

13:06.896 --> 13:09.597
Una mamacita to keep you warm?

13:09.599 --> 13:12.467
Mi casa es su casa.

13:15.171 --> 13:17.021
Cole?!

13:18.818 --> 13:21.185
Cole?!

13:22.011 --> 13:22.977
Yeah?

13:22.979 --> 13:25.813
You got someplace better to be?

13:35.119 --> 13:37.616
You know this agente?

13:38.194 --> 13:39.227
Yeah.

13:39.229 --> 13:40.528
Yeah?

13:40.530 --> 13:42.964
I did four years...

13:42.966 --> 13:45.266
at Lompoc 'cause of this Fed.

13:45.268 --> 13:47.377
Hmm. Don't recall.

13:47.871 --> 13:50.438
All you dirt bags look the same to me.

13:54.511 --> 13:55.409
Shh, shh!

13:58.581 --> 13:59.947
Stupid move, Cole.

13:59.949 --> 14:02.650
It seems you need your
boyfriend here to protect you.

14:02.652 --> 14:04.185
Come on, let's get him out of here.

14:04.187 --> 14:06.287
Up, up, up.

14:06.289 --> 14:08.756
Next time, duck, Fed.

14:17.667 --> 14:20.134
Why didn't I get a
deconfliction notification

14:20.136 --> 14:22.170
from FBI Headquarters
that you were here, Ryan?

14:22.172 --> 14:24.038
Because it was on a
need to know basis, Dad,

14:24.040 --> 14:25.239
and you didn't need to know.

14:25.241 --> 14:27.341
Well, if I did, we wouldn't
have blown your cover!

14:39.040 --> 14:41.274
I've been in Tijuana
the last three months,

14:41.336 --> 14:42.696
deep cover, as biker Cole Dabb.

14:42.860 --> 14:45.728
What does La Horca believe
you bring to the table?

14:45.730 --> 14:47.229
Security.

14:47.231 --> 14:49.532
With this biker gang I got,
we've done some small drug runs

14:49.534 --> 14:51.934
into El Paso to prove ourself
to Hector and his cartel.

14:51.936 --> 14:54.236
And we are just weeks
away from the big shipment

14:54.238 --> 14:55.571
that will take them all down.

14:55.573 --> 14:58.741
So us crashing Hector's
party compromised all that.

14:58.743 --> 15:00.910
Yeah. Yeah, but that's on me.

15:00.912 --> 15:02.678
I should have never
looked away from Dad.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.147
I think... I think I was just
shocked that he was there.

15:05.149 --> 15:06.515
It's all right, it's a rookie mistake.

15:06.517 --> 15:08.517
- I should know better.
- Yes, you should.

15:08.519 --> 15:11.186
But the fight was a nice cover.

15:13.824 --> 15:14.890
Okay, so what now?

15:14.892 --> 15:16.625
Well, we have a backstop plan.

15:16.627 --> 15:18.060
What's a backstop plan?

15:18.062 --> 15:20.863
If things go sideways in
an undercover investigation,

15:20.865 --> 15:23.032
there's a contingency
plan to save cover.

15:23.034 --> 15:24.466
So what is it?

15:24.468 --> 15:27.202
Sorry, Mae. It's above
your clearance level.

15:27.204 --> 15:29.872
Oh, well, I really
need a promotion then.

15:29.874 --> 15:32.908
But, Dad, I need to
get back out there now.

15:34.745 --> 15:36.445
They'll assume we're interrogating you,

15:36.447 --> 15:39.748
so we have until morning before
La Horca becomes suspicious.

15:39.750 --> 15:42.184
And right now, I need
your expertise on Tijuana.

15:42.186 --> 15:44.420
I thought that's what
the local police were for.

15:44.422 --> 15:46.789
We thought so, too, but
right now, they're fighting

15:46.791 --> 15:48.223
too many wars on too many fronts

15:48.225 --> 15:49.892
to worry about us and our problems.

15:49.894 --> 15:52.294
So we need you.

15:56.534 --> 15:57.866
What do you got?

15:57.868 --> 16:00.903
We know all crime in Tijuana
leads right back to the cartels.

16:00.905 --> 16:02.504
Yeah. They're like an octopus.

16:02.506 --> 16:03.939
They have their tentacles in everything.

16:03.941 --> 16:06.208
But this... this kid's death
had nothing to do with La Horca.

16:06.210 --> 16:07.610
How can you be so sure of that?

16:07.612 --> 16:10.012
Because even the smallest crimes
have to be blessed by Hector,

16:10.014 --> 16:11.380
their leader, and this wasn't.

16:11.382 --> 16:13.349
Well, the forensic evidence
supports what Ryan's saying.

16:13.351 --> 16:15.017
The sand is free of
any organic materials,

16:15.019 --> 16:16.585
which means it didn't
come from the beach.

16:16.587 --> 16:17.886
Then where did it come from?

16:17.888 --> 16:19.121
A sand bag.

16:19.123 --> 16:21.290
Wet sand or dirt with organic materials

16:21.292 --> 16:22.891
can rot and decompose.

16:22.893 --> 16:26.228
It creates a problem with mold
and mildew and unpleasant odors.

16:26.230 --> 16:29.198
And so they filter all of that
out in the store-made sand bags.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.266
Yeah, sand bags are typically
associated with flooding,

16:31.268 --> 16:33.702
but they can be used
to hold things down.

16:33.704 --> 16:36.939
A sickle, a sand bag, and a vehicle.

16:36.941 --> 16:40.342
If this wasn't La Horca, who was it?

16:40.344 --> 16:43.812
And who'd be so bold as to do
this in the cartel's territory?

16:43.814 --> 16:46.582
Guys, we got another body.

16:46.584 --> 16:47.916
We have an I.D.?

16:47.918 --> 16:50.419
American businessman Robert Miller.

16:50.421 --> 16:51.387
Where?

16:51.389 --> 16:52.621
That's the thing, just like last time,

16:52.623 --> 16:53.656
there are two crime scenes.

16:53.658 --> 16:55.090
Mexican authorities found his car

16:55.092 --> 16:57.593
at a parking lot just
outside the dog track.

16:57.595 --> 16:59.328
That's probably where he was abducted.

16:59.330 --> 17:02.398
And the we found his body
staged under a bridge in Tijuana.

17:02.400 --> 17:05.434
Clara, Simmons, see what you
can find from the abduction site.

17:05.435 --> 17:07.336
Mae, you and Ryan come with me.

17:07.338 --> 17:09.038
No, I can't show my face out there.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.373
Then you won't.

17:11.375 --> 17:13.442
Well, staging is clearly similar.

17:13.444 --> 17:16.078
He's also painted black.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.479
His carotid is sliced upon,

17:17.481 --> 17:18.714
and he's been left out in the open.

17:18.715 --> 17:20.883
Yet significantly more gruesome.

17:20.885 --> 17:24.086
Unsub removed his arms.
The violence is escalating.

17:24.088 --> 17:25.454
Yeah, but he didn't pose him.

17:25.455 --> 17:27.455
So the religious
connotations of the first body

17:27.458 --> 17:29.858
are most likely coincidental. Agreed.

17:29.860 --> 17:32.494
He's sliced, gutted,
bled out, and dismembered

17:32.496 --> 17:35.030
before being coated with
black paint postmortem.

17:35.032 --> 17:37.766
I mean, it's almost like
he was dipped in a vat.

17:37.768 --> 17:39.535
How can you tell when
the body was painted?

17:39.537 --> 17:41.303
Well...

17:41.305 --> 17:43.272
the unsub painted over dried blood,

17:43.274 --> 17:45.541
so the body bled out
before being painted,

17:45.543 --> 17:48.143
which tells us something
about the unsub's ritual.

17:48.145 --> 17:49.445
Like?

17:49.447 --> 17:52.681
Well, all the mutilations and
the force-feeding of cigars

17:52.683 --> 17:55.951
and I smell beer, too, it's postmortem.

17:55.953 --> 17:57.653
So this isn't about
the victim suffering.

17:57.655 --> 17:59.621
There doesn't appear to
be any malice towards them.

17:59.623 --> 18:02.057
Lee Kern's body was
displayed in a public square

18:02.059 --> 18:05.794
for everyone to see, Robert
Miller is under a bridge.

18:05.796 --> 18:08.630
Given the conflicting
settings, it doesn't appear

18:08.632 --> 18:10.866
that the unsub is trying
to make a statement.

18:10.868 --> 18:12.968
Not a consistent one, at least.

18:15.072 --> 18:16.338
Go.

18:16.340 --> 18:18.340
Hey, Jack, the front left tire

18:18.342 --> 18:20.342
on the vic's vehicle was slashed.

18:20.344 --> 18:22.111
Yeah, the unsub probably ambushed him.

18:22.113 --> 18:24.213
That indicates a
highly-organized attack.

18:24.215 --> 18:26.749
And, Jack, we also found
something else interesting.

18:26.751 --> 18:28.016
Shoot.

18:28.018 --> 18:29.218
Well, whatever vehicle they're using

18:29.220 --> 18:30.252
to transport the bodies

18:30.254 --> 18:33.122
is leaking fuel in its own tire track.

18:33.124 --> 18:37.059
Yep. I found it here, too.

18:38.028 --> 18:40.863
Gas.

18:40.865 --> 18:42.531
Peanuts.

18:42.533 --> 18:44.733
Well, whoever's doing this
has converted their vehicle

18:44.735 --> 18:46.034
to be Eco-friendly.

18:46.036 --> 18:47.903
And we didn't see it in the alleyway

18:47.905 --> 18:50.172
at the first kill because
we were at the scene

18:50.174 --> 18:54.510
almost 24 hours after
the fact and it dried.

18:54.512 --> 18:55.310
Monty, you there?

18:55.312 --> 18:56.612
I am, indeed.

18:56.614 --> 18:58.313
And it seems that the Eco-friendly craze

18:58.315 --> 18:59.882
is still pretty small there in Tijuana.

18:59.884 --> 19:01.383
So let me see what I can dig up.

19:01.385 --> 19:03.919
Are you able to find a
connection between the vics?

19:03.921 --> 19:05.888
No, in fact, other than
them both being American,

19:05.890 --> 19:07.689
it seems they couldn't
be any more different.

19:07.691 --> 19:09.725
Lee Kern was a high school
senior from San Diego,

19:09.727 --> 19:12.094
Miller was from Flagstaff, Arizona,

19:12.096 --> 19:14.630
who was an engineer for
BTL Petroleum Industries.

19:14.632 --> 19:16.331
Wait, he works for a
Mexican oil company?

19:16.333 --> 19:17.432
That's correct.

19:17.434 --> 19:19.711
Could this be Eco-terrorism?

19:20.604 --> 19:22.771
Guys, come here.

19:26.010 --> 19:27.609
Or is it the cartels?

19:27.611 --> 19:30.379
I thought you said La Horca
wasn't involved in this.

19:30.381 --> 19:32.781
Right, La Horca, but there
are other cartels in Tijuana

19:32.783 --> 19:35.217
vying for power, and their
mutual enemy is Big Oil.

19:35.219 --> 19:36.185
Big Oil?

19:36.187 --> 19:37.686
Yeah, a few years back,

19:37.688 --> 19:39.788
the cartels started tapping
into the oil company's

19:39.790 --> 19:42.391
main line and siphoning off
large amounts of oil to sell.

19:42.393 --> 19:43.492
To combat this,

19:43.494 --> 19:44.860
the oil companies
brought in mercenaries.

19:44.862 --> 19:46.195
It's been a war ever since.

19:46.197 --> 19:48.363
Like this place doesn't
have enough problems already.

19:48.365 --> 19:50.499
But the different cartels
don't agree on anything

19:50.501 --> 19:52.234
except their mutual hatred for Big Oil.

19:52.236 --> 19:54.036
So maybe this wasn't just a message.

19:54.038 --> 19:55.737
Maybe it was a blood sacrifice.

19:55.739 --> 19:56.738
A blood sacrifice?

19:56.740 --> 19:58.740
Yeah, think like an animal sacrifice,

19:58.742 --> 20:01.176
only the cigar and the
beer were the offerings.

20:01.178 --> 20:02.244
Okay, but to whom?

20:02.246 --> 20:03.862
When I saw the offerings,
I started thinking

20:03.868 --> 20:06.682
how the cartels used to
commonly go to black magic

20:06.684 --> 20:08.684
looking for protection or favor.

20:08.686 --> 20:10.886
Of course! Like in 2003, there was

20:10.888 --> 20:13.188
this American college
student who was abducted

20:13.190 --> 20:15.357
in a border town by local dealers.

20:15.359 --> 20:18.560
He was killed as part
of a human sacrifice

20:18.562 --> 20:21.029
to protect a large drug
shipment going out the next day.

20:21.031 --> 20:23.532
So Officer Calderon was
right, this was the cartels.

20:23.534 --> 20:24.867
Just not the way we thought.

20:24.869 --> 20:27.202
So this has nothing to do
with someone running afoul

20:27.204 --> 20:28.136
of Mexican drug dealers.

20:28.138 --> 20:29.277
But may have everything to do with

20:29.293 --> 20:30.939
the cartels' black magic rituals.

20:30.941 --> 20:32.608
They employ a spirit guide.

20:32.610 --> 20:35.110
It's one part voodoo
doctor, one part priest,

20:35.112 --> 20:36.879
and the rest, all devil worship.

20:36.881 --> 20:38.614
He's the number one guy in these parts,

20:38.616 --> 20:42.317
his name is Julio
Salazar... A.K.A. El Cuco.

20:42.319 --> 20:44.720
If he's not behind
this, he knows who is.

20:44.722 --> 20:46.788
Where can we find him?

20:51.528 --> 20:54.162
- You're kidding me.
- No.

20:54.164 --> 20:56.131
When El Cuco is not
doing black magic rituals,

20:56.133 --> 20:57.566
he's giving palm readings to tourists

20:57.568 --> 20:59.568
or selling occult
paraphernalia to the locals.

20:59.570 --> 21:01.737
I mean, just the idea that
he's getting this close

21:01.739 --> 21:04.239
to innocent people on a daily
basis makes my skin crawl.

21:04.241 --> 21:05.540
Yeah, well, wait till you meet him.

21:05.542 --> 21:06.909
He's got the charm of a rattlesnake.

21:06.911 --> 21:08.610
The shop is halfway
between the kill sites

21:08.612 --> 21:10.412
and where the unsub has been
bleeding out their victims.

21:10.414 --> 21:12.547
El Cuco definitely needs
blood for his rituals.

21:12.549 --> 21:14.516
Could be why we didn't find all
the blood at the crime scene.

21:14.518 --> 21:16.218
So he's collecting them
at a secondary location

21:16.220 --> 21:17.486
for ritualistic purposes.

21:17.488 --> 21:19.521
All right, everybody follow my lead.

21:19.523 --> 21:22.658
Ryan, you stay back, cover our six.

21:27.097 --> 21:29.298
FBI.

22:09.540 --> 22:11.807
His eyes are gone.

22:29.771 --> 22:32.067
This definitely looks like black magic.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.252
Yeah, well, black magic
is treated differently here

22:34.254 --> 22:35.076
than it is in the States.

22:35.131 --> 22:38.055
Yeah, superstitions have a long
tradition in Mexican culture,

22:38.057 --> 22:40.858
so spells to the locals
are like prayers to us.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.093
All right, let's go through this.

22:42.095 --> 22:44.028
The third victim is Julio Salazar,

22:44.030 --> 22:46.063
killed in the same
manner as the first two.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.408
His neck was slashed with a sickle,

22:48.455 --> 22:50.799
and like the second victim, he
had cigars stuffed in his mouth.

22:50.909 --> 22:52.375
But this time, his eyes were removed.

22:52.377 --> 22:54.578
Yeah, it looks like the
same killer, but if it was,

22:54.580 --> 22:56.747
why wasn't the body
painted in the same manner?

22:56.749 --> 22:58.081
Yeah, the body wasn't dipped in a vat

22:58.083 --> 22:59.483
like the other ones, or even moved.

22:59.485 --> 23:01.918
All the blood confirms that
this is the primary crime scene.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.453
But if this is another blood sacrifice,

23:03.455 --> 23:04.721
how does it fit the pattern?

23:04.723 --> 23:06.790
Or why does it deviate? I
mean, the first two kills

23:06.792 --> 23:07.891
were clean and precise,

23:07.893 --> 23:09.659
and this one just
seems angry and rushed.

23:09.661 --> 23:11.194
And how are these victims connected?

23:11.196 --> 23:14.831
In under 12 hours, we have
three murders with similar M.O.s.

23:14.833 --> 23:17.200
But if his spells provided
protection to the cartels,

23:17.202 --> 23:18.301
then why kill him?

23:18.303 --> 23:20.103
Because the unsubs weren't
tied to the cartels,

23:20.105 --> 23:23.173
more likely an individual driven
to make black magic sacrifices.

23:23.175 --> 23:24.407
For their own protection?

23:24.409 --> 23:26.777
Maybe. Certainly feels
like a spree-oriented kill.

23:26.779 --> 23:28.378
The killers seem to be deviating.

23:28.380 --> 23:29.446
Their pace is increasing.

23:29.448 --> 23:31.314
Yeah. But to what end?

23:31.316 --> 23:32.215
And for whom?

23:34.353 --> 23:35.685
Go ahead, Monty.

23:35.687 --> 23:39.256
So with pollution and
war over oil in Tijuana,

23:39.258 --> 23:41.758
a few locals have converted
their diesel engines

23:41.760 --> 23:42.859
to run on food oils.

23:42.861 --> 23:44.194
Five people have registered

23:44.196 --> 23:46.358
their biodiesel engines with the DMV.

23:46.428 --> 23:47.952
I was able to find four of them,

23:48.006 --> 23:49.633
and they have confirmed
alibis with the police.

23:49.635 --> 23:51.168
But the fifth one is M.I.A.

23:51.170 --> 23:52.068
You got a name?

23:52.070 --> 23:53.870
Miguel Gonzalez, 40.

23:53.872 --> 23:55.105
Essentially fallen off the planet.

23:55.107 --> 23:56.807
Access to his address has been blocked,

23:56.809 --> 23:58.441
but I put in a call to the Tijuana DMV

23:58.443 --> 23:59.509
to figure out why.

23:59.511 --> 24:01.311
That seems like a person of interest.

24:01.313 --> 24:02.612
What else have you found?

24:02.614 --> 24:04.881
Robert Miller's employer
laid him off nine months ago.

24:04.883 --> 24:06.583
However, he's been crossing
the border into Mexico

24:06.585 --> 24:09.152
from his home in Arizona, where
he's married with two kids.

24:09.154 --> 24:11.254
He could have just been
searching for other employment.

24:11.256 --> 24:13.523
Maybe, but, strangely,
he had his severance check

24:13.525 --> 24:15.992
forwarded to an address
in the village of Narvado

24:15.994 --> 24:17.327
on the outskirts of Tijuana

24:17.329 --> 24:18.562
instead of his home in the U.S.

24:18.564 --> 24:20.197
All right, Mae, you stay with the body

24:20.199 --> 24:22.108
until the local authorities arrive.

24:22.701 --> 24:24.734
Monty, get me an address for Miller.

24:24.736 --> 24:26.903
You got it.

24:26.905 --> 24:28.805
Why don't you guys head to Miller's,

24:28.807 --> 24:31.708
and I'll catch up with you later?

24:37.850 --> 24:39.425
Are you okay, Dad?

24:40.052 --> 24:41.852
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

24:41.854 --> 24:43.220
I'll see you in a bit.

24:43.222 --> 24:44.788
Okay.

24:49.561 --> 24:50.827
Agent Jack Garrett.

24:50.829 --> 24:52.329
Section Chief Cruz, Jack.

24:52.331 --> 24:54.464
Mateo, long time, no speak.

24:54.466 --> 24:55.532
What can I do for you?

24:55.534 --> 24:56.900
I think you know the answer to that.

24:56.902 --> 24:57.868
The director's not happy.

24:57.870 --> 24:58.935
We're handling it.

24:58.937 --> 25:00.770
You pulled you son from a high-profile

25:00.772 --> 25:02.772
undercover operation and
have yet to pull the trigger

25:02.774 --> 25:04.107
on the backstop plan. Why?

25:04.109 --> 25:07.010
Since we have no local
assistance in the area,

25:07.012 --> 25:09.145
Ryan's knowledge on the ground has been

25:09.147 --> 25:11.581
an integral part of the
I.R.T.'s investigation.

25:11.583 --> 25:13.450
Cut the bull, Jack. You
had no right to pull him.

25:13.452 --> 25:14.784
His cover was blown.

25:14.786 --> 25:16.186
It was compromised, okay?

25:16.188 --> 25:17.821
You're trying to buy time,
and we don't have any.

25:17.823 --> 25:22.158
You've got to put the
backstop plan in motion ASAP.

25:22.160 --> 25:26.730
Look, I understand he's
your son, but duty calls.

25:30.102 --> 25:31.334
Copy.

25:31.336 --> 25:32.702
Good.

25:32.704 --> 25:36.115
I'll tell the director that
there will be no more delays.

25:41.013 --> 25:43.280
We got the call.

25:51.089 --> 25:52.923
How did you come upon such darkness?

25:52.925 --> 25:55.892
Some clues and some
profiling led us to his door.

25:55.894 --> 25:57.360
- You know him?
- Sí.

25:57.362 --> 25:59.529
He's the Don of Darkness,
but from the looks of it,

25:59.531 --> 26:01.097
he got what he had coming to him.

26:01.099 --> 26:03.500
Probably got double crossed
by his bosses in the cartels.

26:03.502 --> 26:04.768
Why do you say that?

26:04.770 --> 26:07.771
Who else would dare kill a
priest of such dark power?

26:08.974 --> 26:12.327
Maybe someone who needs
or wants that power.

26:12.617 --> 26:14.749
_

26:15.847 --> 26:17.380
Ryan, perimeter's clean.

26:17.382 --> 26:19.015
No signs of blood or struggle anywhere.

26:19.017 --> 26:21.251
All right. Let's take a look inside.

26:24.790 --> 26:25.922
Hola.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.293
My name is Ana Sofia.

26:30.295 --> 26:31.995
I speak English, if that's easier.

26:31.997 --> 26:33.496
- Great.
- Mama?

26:33.671 --> 26:35.624
_

26:36.134 --> 26:38.435
They're just here to
ask a few questions.

26:38.437 --> 26:39.803
But why don't you go to your room,

26:39.805 --> 26:41.371
and I'll tell you all about it later.

26:41.373 --> 26:43.740
How about that? Yeah?

26:44.977 --> 26:46.734
Please, come in.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.513
What's going on here?

26:50.515 --> 26:51.881
That's what we're
hoping you can tell us.

26:53.385 --> 26:56.252
Simmons, Clara.

26:56.254 --> 26:58.688
Robert Miller is your
husband, Arturo is his son?

26:58.690 --> 27:00.957
Sí.

27:00.959 --> 27:03.526
Is this about his other family?

27:03.528 --> 27:04.728
So you know about them?

27:04.730 --> 27:06.896
I only discovered it a few months ago

27:06.898 --> 27:09.032
when his job sent over some paperwork

27:09.034 --> 27:10.700
listing his wife in Arizona.

27:10.702 --> 27:12.369
And what happened when you
confronted him about it?

27:12.371 --> 27:14.671
He admitted it, and we fought.

27:14.673 --> 27:15.563
But...

27:16.174 --> 27:19.133
my son needs a father, so...

27:19.811 --> 27:21.344
we're managing.

27:23.348 --> 27:26.416
But you're here for another reason.

27:27.819 --> 27:29.886
What did Roberto do?

27:29.888 --> 27:31.821
I'm sorry, but your husband

27:31.823 --> 27:33.857
has been the victim of a homicide.

27:39.886 --> 27:42.219
Dios mío.

27:47.572 --> 27:49.806
Mrs. Miller, you didn't
know about your husband's

27:49.808 --> 27:51.041
other family for years.

27:51.043 --> 27:52.909
Is it possible that he
had other affiliations,

27:52.911 --> 27:54.911
relationships that
could have led to this?

27:54.913 --> 27:58.522
My husband gambled, and he drank, and...

27:59.084 --> 28:01.068
God knows what else, but...

28:01.720 --> 28:03.920
he always kept a roof over our heads,

28:03.922 --> 28:05.989
and he never laid a hand on me.

28:05.991 --> 28:08.925
Or my son or anybody else.

28:11.730 --> 28:15.165
But you do know
something, don't you, Ana?

28:16.201 --> 28:17.667
What is it?

28:36.988 --> 28:39.422
A shrine to the Grim Reaper?

28:39.424 --> 28:41.024
No.

28:41.026 --> 28:42.492
La Santa Muerte...

28:42.494 --> 28:44.594
Patron saint of those
who've been left behind.

28:44.596 --> 28:45.695
Left behind by whom?

28:45.697 --> 28:47.664
By God.

28:49.301 --> 28:52.669
Ana, did you have something to
do with your husband's death?

28:54.806 --> 28:56.929
I was so angry.

28:57.843 --> 28:59.876
I prayed for bad things.

28:59.878 --> 29:02.245
But I didn't mean any of them.

29:02.247 --> 29:04.714
I was so upset.

29:04.716 --> 29:06.683
You prayed here at this altar?

29:06.685 --> 29:08.384
Yeah.

29:08.386 --> 29:11.020
And at the Tijuana mobile altars.

29:11.022 --> 29:13.323
Mama?

29:16.261 --> 29:19.462
If you need anything,
I'll be with my son.

29:24.236 --> 29:26.603
The La Santa Muerte following
is one of the largest

29:26.605 --> 29:28.538
belief systems in Mexico.

29:28.540 --> 29:30.140
They've got 12 million followers.

29:30.142 --> 29:31.774
Right, but both the Catholic Church,

29:31.776 --> 29:33.776
who views it as an evil
offshoot of Catholicism,

29:33.778 --> 29:35.912
and the local police, who
see it as a belief system

29:35.914 --> 29:37.914
for the lower class, have
outlawed and denounced

29:37.916 --> 29:38.715
the faith's practice.

29:38.717 --> 29:39.582
Outlawed it?

29:39.584 --> 29:41.050
Yeah, there are no churches.

29:41.052 --> 29:43.319
I mean, its followers have
to set up prayer altars

29:43.321 --> 29:45.522
like these that are either
mobile or easily dismantled

29:45.524 --> 29:47.690
so the local police don't
find them and destroy them.

29:47.692 --> 29:49.325
Well, isn't it true that
if you ask for something

29:49.327 --> 29:50.727
from La Santa Muerte,
you have to offer her

29:50.729 --> 29:52.162
- something in return?
- Yes.

29:52.164 --> 29:53.663
Like a metaphysical quid pro quo.

29:53.665 --> 29:56.366
Is the unsub doing this
because they want something

29:56.368 --> 29:58.735
from La Santa Muerte,
and if so, what is it?

29:58.737 --> 30:00.370
The colors strewn across the altar,

30:00.372 --> 30:01.337
they're the same colors

30:01.339 --> 30:02.972
that the first two victims were painted.

30:02.974 --> 30:04.340
Yeah, this is more
than just superstition.

30:04.342 --> 30:07.443
We're looking at a La
Santa Muerte practitioner

30:07.445 --> 30:08.811
or a fanatic.

30:11.650 --> 30:13.850
- Hey.
- All right, Monty.

30:13.852 --> 30:15.718
Everyone's here. Go ahead.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.621
Okay, La Santa Muerte
is highly adaptable

30:18.623 --> 30:19.722
to the individual believer.

30:19.724 --> 30:21.457
Not only do they not have any churches,

30:21.459 --> 30:22.926
there's also no bible, either.

30:22.928 --> 30:24.861
Followers have spells
that have been handed down

30:24.863 --> 30:26.362
from generations through word of mouth.

30:26.364 --> 30:29.265
I found one ex-member who wrote a blog

30:29.267 --> 30:30.934
that outlines some of the spells.

30:30.936 --> 30:32.335
Can you link any of them to the murders?

30:32.337 --> 30:34.571
What seems to be consistent
here is that two of the three

30:34.573 --> 30:37.006
murders have been blood sacrifice spells

30:37.008 --> 30:39.008
designed to restore an absent loved one.

30:39.010 --> 30:40.543
So the unsub lost someone.

30:40.545 --> 30:42.779
And this is all a personal
act to get that person back.

30:42.781 --> 30:45.348
Turns out the colors have
a power structure to them.

30:45.350 --> 30:48.718
Red is the lowest, then black
is a little bit more powerful.

30:48.720 --> 30:49.886
Gold is king.

30:49.888 --> 30:51.788
Lee Kern was the first, and he was red.

30:51.790 --> 30:54.324
Yeah, and the red spell
asks for the bloodletting

30:54.326 --> 30:55.625
of someone young.

30:55.627 --> 30:57.961
So the sacrifice of Lee
Kern should have satisfied

30:57.963 --> 30:59.629
the saint and returned
the unsub's loved ones.

30:59.631 --> 31:00.863
But, clearly, it didn't.

31:00.865 --> 31:03.333
So then the unsub tried
to cast a stronger spell.

31:03.335 --> 31:04.701
Exactamundo.

31:04.703 --> 31:07.203
The color black asks for
the bloodletting of a sinner,

31:07.205 --> 31:09.439
so the display of Robert
Miller should have worked, too.

31:09.441 --> 31:10.807
But it didn't, either.

31:10.809 --> 31:13.009
Therefore, the unsub
felt he needed more power

31:13.011 --> 31:16.079
and tried to absorb it by
killing the occult priest,

31:16.081 --> 31:17.213
Julio Salazar.

31:17.215 --> 31:19.415
And now with the most
powerful color left,

31:19.417 --> 31:21.150
they believe that they will
get their loved one back.

31:21.152 --> 31:22.885
What does the gold sacrifice entail?

31:22.887 --> 31:24.988
Taking the heart from
a person of authority,

31:24.990 --> 31:27.290
but unlike the others,
the victim must be alive,

31:27.292 --> 31:29.692
aware during the ceremony.

31:29.694 --> 31:32.061
So this grief-induced
spiritually-motivated unsub

31:32.063 --> 31:34.163
is out there right now looking
for someone who fits that.

31:34.165 --> 31:37.834
Someone like an officer of the law.

31:45.216 --> 31:48.282
_

31:49.197 --> 31:52.478
_

31:56.198 --> 32:00.049
_

32:02.363 --> 32:04.496
_

32:05.644 --> 32:08.769
_

32:11.290 --> 32:15.555
_

32:17.802 --> 32:18.802
_

32:19.880 --> 32:20.919
_

32:21.880 --> 32:23.403
_

32:29.682 --> 32:31.264
Officer Calderon is missing.

32:31.299 --> 32:32.791
He was on a disturbing the peace call

32:32.862 --> 32:34.565
for a La Santa Muerte altar.

32:34.627 --> 32:36.560
He ran the plates, and they
belong to Miguel Gonzalez.

32:36.562 --> 32:39.063
But here's the thing. I
found Miguel, and he's dead.

32:39.065 --> 32:40.298
Who was driving the truck?

32:40.300 --> 32:42.099
Impound records show that Alma Gonzalez

32:42.101 --> 32:43.567
has reclaimed the car three times.

32:43.569 --> 32:45.303
Gonzalez? Any relation to Miguel?

32:45.305 --> 32:46.537
Yeah, brother and sister.

32:46.539 --> 32:48.139
Well, why was the truck
towed in the first place?

32:48.141 --> 32:50.174
Because it had a La Santa
Muerte altar in the bed.

32:50.176 --> 32:52.343
The altars are illegal,
so the police destroy them

32:52.345 --> 32:54.245
and impound any vehicle
associated with them.

32:54.247 --> 32:57.648
And Alma has a long history of
violations, and even arrests.

32:57.650 --> 32:59.817
The last one, only two
months ago by Officer Calderon

32:59.819 --> 33:02.119
for erecting and displaying
La Santa Muerte altars.

33:02.121 --> 33:03.988
Probably had the sand
bags to hold down the altar

33:03.990 --> 33:04.955
in the back of the truck.

33:04.957 --> 33:05.923
It must have busted open,

33:05.925 --> 33:07.291
transferring some sand to the victims.

33:07.293 --> 33:09.627
Alma's connection to La
Santa Muerte and Miguel

33:09.629 --> 33:10.961
make her our prime suspect.

33:10.963 --> 33:14.065
According to public records,
Alma and her sister, Teresa,

33:14.067 --> 33:17.101
were left a family-owned
business a year ago.

33:17.103 --> 33:18.703
Wait a minute. There's another sibling?

33:18.705 --> 33:20.738
So what if the black
magic priest's murder

33:20.740 --> 33:21.739
felt like a different kill

33:21.741 --> 33:23.174
because they're two different unsubs?

33:23.176 --> 33:24.942
Alma and Teresa are working as a team.

33:24.944 --> 33:27.144
Together, they drive around
T.J. in a pickup truck

33:27.146 --> 33:29.580
with a Santa Muerte altar,
looking for their next victims.

33:29.582 --> 33:31.549
To find someone young,
they went to Tijuana's

33:31.551 --> 33:32.983
most popular bar district.

33:32.985 --> 33:35.486
They needed a sinner, so they
found a gambler at a dog track.

33:35.488 --> 33:36.654
And needing a man of authority,

33:36.656 --> 33:38.155
they lure a police officer
in with their altar.

33:38.157 --> 33:41.192
So the family biz is a salvage yard,

33:41.194 --> 33:44.295
which he signed over
about a year ago today.

33:44.297 --> 33:45.663
Wait, why would he sign it over?

33:45.665 --> 33:47.832
Miguel applied for a
U.S. Visa, but was denied,

33:47.834 --> 33:49.734
so he did what millions
of other people do

33:49.736 --> 33:52.436
in search for a better life...
He hopped the border illegally.

33:52.438 --> 33:53.771
He didn't make it, did he?

33:53.773 --> 33:55.958
No, and his absence has
been absolutely devastating

33:55.997 --> 33:56.707
to his sisters.

33:56.709 --> 33:59.276
They're about to lose the
salvage yard to bankruptcy,

33:59.278 --> 34:00.344
which explains why I wasn't able

34:00.346 --> 34:02.246
to access the address through the DMV.

34:02.248 --> 34:04.543
The truck's being held up
in a probate court case.

34:04.567 --> 34:06.168
So they haven't heard
or seen their brother

34:06.184 --> 34:06.910
in over a year.

34:06.965 --> 34:09.620
The anniversary of his
disappearance is their trigger.

34:09.621 --> 34:11.856
So the sisters believe that
by performing this ritual,

34:11.858 --> 34:13.891
they can bring their
brother Miguel back to them

34:13.893 --> 34:15.159
and he'll fix everything.

34:15.161 --> 34:18.161
And they needed Officer
Calderon alive to perform it.

34:18.164 --> 34:20.931
We better hurry before
he runs out of time.

34:33.346 --> 34:35.780
Ryan, you hang back.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.549
Anyone tries to get
in or out, stop them.

34:46.058 --> 34:47.992
FBI! Drop the weapon!

34:49.562 --> 34:52.196
Move away from Officer Calderon!

34:52.197 --> 34:54.331
We know what you're doing.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.567
How your brother,
Miguel, went to the States

34:56.569 --> 34:57.735
to make a better living.

34:57.737 --> 35:00.171
And once settled, he was
going to send for you both,

35:00.173 --> 35:01.105
but he never did.

35:01.107 --> 35:02.606
Because he couldn't.

35:02.608 --> 35:05.509
You see, he made it across,
but he didn't get far.

35:05.511 --> 35:06.677
Mentirosos!

35:06.679 --> 35:07.578
We're not lying, Alma.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.246
You are!

35:09.248 --> 35:10.748
Miguel is in America.

35:10.750 --> 35:14.652
But Teresa and I, we broke
our promise to La Santa Muerte.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.654
We stopped displaying our
altar because we were afraid of

35:16.656 --> 35:18.456
la policia, so she's punishing us.

35:18.458 --> 35:20.057
Keeping Miguel away from us,

35:20.059 --> 35:22.226
taking our business and our home, too!

35:22.228 --> 35:23.994
With this final sacrifice,

35:23.996 --> 35:26.363
we'll satisfy La Huesuda
and return Miguel to us!

35:26.365 --> 35:29.033
No, no! It's too late for that.

35:29.035 --> 35:30.668
I'm, sorry.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.837
Miguel is dead.

35:34.307 --> 35:37.208
You'll never see Miguel again.

35:43.649 --> 35:44.515
No!

36:01.534 --> 36:07.972
I pity the sisters.
Their grief, it just...

36:07.974 --> 36:12.009
it twisted a faith that offers
real hope and guidance to many.

36:12.011 --> 36:15.279
You also offer hope.

36:15.281 --> 36:17.982
The way you fight for your
people against monumental odds.

36:17.984 --> 36:20.718
The world can use more
men like you, Calderon.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.753
Gracias.

36:39.205 --> 36:41.405
Good work, Dad.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.908
Couldn't have done it without you, son.

36:43.910 --> 36:46.010
I don't know about that.

36:46.012 --> 36:49.213
Look, now that it's over,
I need to get back under.

36:51.384 --> 36:53.050
Why are you taking the toughest,

36:53.052 --> 36:55.286
most dangerous road
there is in the Bureau?

36:55.288 --> 36:58.689
You cast a really large shadow.

36:58.691 --> 37:00.291
I have to make my own way if I ever hope

37:00.293 --> 37:01.926
to step out of it, become my own man.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.827
Yeah, I get that.

37:03.829 --> 37:05.796
But at what price?

37:05.798 --> 37:08.198
The exact same price
you've been willing to pay

37:08.200 --> 37:10.701
your entire career.

37:10.703 --> 37:12.670
I'm asking you to see
me as a fellow agent,

37:12.672 --> 37:14.672
not as your son.

37:16.008 --> 37:18.742
That's easier said than done.

37:18.744 --> 37:20.544
I know you're worried.

37:20.546 --> 37:24.181
But you know the deeper
my cover, the safer I am.

37:24.183 --> 37:25.883
This backstop plan's gonna give me

37:25.885 --> 37:28.218
even more credibility with La Horca.

37:39.398 --> 37:45.202
Ryan, you remember when you were little

37:45.204 --> 37:47.371
and we used to go to that lake

37:47.373 --> 37:48.906
and fish all day?

37:48.908 --> 37:51.075
Yeah.

37:51.077 --> 37:53.611
Yeah, you'd start a fire.

37:53.613 --> 37:55.980
Fry up some perch or
catfish that we'd caught.

37:55.982 --> 37:59.283
We'd just watch the stars and talk.

37:59.285 --> 38:02.152
Some of the best times of my life.

38:03.556 --> 38:05.489
Yeah, me too.

38:07.059 --> 38:10.961
But when this is over,
you owe me a fishing trip.

38:48.768 --> 38:51.168
Habla Inglés?

38:51.170 --> 38:53.837
His name is Cole Dabb, and
we got him on possession,

38:53.839 --> 38:55.639
intent to distribute,

38:55.641 --> 38:58.008
assault and battery of a federal agent.

38:58.010 --> 39:01.712
We tried to extradite
him, but we couldn't.

39:04.850 --> 39:07.184
He's your problem now.
