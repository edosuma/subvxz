WEBVTT

00:38.780 --> 00:40.828
-Hey.
-All right, you made it!

00:42.040 --> 00:43.530
-Good.
-Want a beer?

00:44.460 --> 00:46.781
Rise, my creation!

00:49.000 --> 00:50.490
-All right.
-Have a good flight.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.370
-See you.
-Bye.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.500
Bye.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.157
And finally, Your Honor,
last week I caught him

01:24.290 --> 01:27.362
just sitting in his car
across the street, watching us.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.538
I chased him off, but he came back
that night and jumped in our pool.

01:30.670 --> 01:32.911
He was wasted
and screaming his head off.

01:33.050 --> 01:34.290
Our son can't sleep.

01:34.420 --> 01:37.048
He's worried about this guy
breaking into our house.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.751
Your Honor,
I know he used to live there,

01:39.890 --> 01:41.756
and I am sorry
for whatever happened...

01:42.310 --> 01:43.380
but this has to stop.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.551
Mr. Dudley, you can respond.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.930
Well, first of all,

01:48.060 --> 01:52.145
let me just say how embarrassed I am
that it's come to this.

01:53.230 --> 01:56.143
There's really no excuse
for my behavior.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.366
I don't know.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.731
Something happens to you
when you lose your job.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.781
It's just...

02:07.290 --> 02:08.746
Afternoons are hard,

02:08.870 --> 02:11.532
not doing what you usually do.

02:11.670 --> 02:13.832
So you start to feel a little...

02:14.550 --> 02:16.370
a little weird, a little guilty.

02:16.840 --> 02:17.830
You know?

02:18.470 --> 02:20.848
Two o'clock. Two o'clock.
Two o'clock is the worst.

02:20.970 --> 02:24.053
It's just the way the light hits you.
It gets under your skin.

02:25.810 --> 02:28.472
And, you know,
it can make you go a little crazy.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.590
You know?

02:31.810 --> 02:33.721
Now, does that make any sense, or...?

02:34.650 --> 02:35.560
No.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.698
Look, the point... the point is...

02:39.410 --> 02:40.809
is that I was drinking...

02:41.660 --> 02:42.650
a lot.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.572
You know, it wasn't
the fun kind of drinking, either.

02:47.330 --> 02:50.072
But I'm on a better path now,
Your Honor.

02:50.210 --> 02:52.201
I recently entered
the Order of the Lynx.

02:52.330 --> 02:54.833
-Is that a rehab facility?
-No.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.416
No, it's a secret society.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.180
It's not secret-secret. You know,
you can Google them or whatever.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.632
But it was founded in 1866
by Harwood Fritz Merrill.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.388
Mr. Dudley, this is the last hearing
before lunch.

03:05.510 --> 03:07.217
Yeah, yeah. Of course. I'm sorry.

03:08.640 --> 03:12.224
I have an appointment with
a temporary employment agency.

03:12.810 --> 03:13.800
So...

03:14.860 --> 03:16.931
I am trying, Your Honor.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.277
But most of all...

03:22.320 --> 03:25.233
what I really want to say
to you guys is...

03:27.750 --> 03:28.865
I'm sorry.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.667
I'm truly sorry.

03:33.500 --> 03:37.289
The idea of your kid
being scared like that,

03:37.420 --> 03:40.003
it's the worst thing
I can ever possibly imagine.

03:40.880 --> 03:41.870
So...

03:42.640 --> 03:44.756
I was lucky to grow up in that house.

03:45.220 --> 03:46.210
And...

03:46.850 --> 03:50.673
I kind of dreamed of raising a family
of my own one day in there.

03:52.310 --> 03:53.300
But I guess...

03:54.900 --> 03:58.609
all I care about now is that your son
is as happy in there as I was.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.355
So I won't come back.

04:01.780 --> 04:02.770
I promise.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.446
Your Honor,

04:10.580 --> 04:12.116
I think he means what he says.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.918
Maybe at this point,
the best thing to do is drop the...

04:16.790 --> 04:17.916
the complaint.

04:19.089 --> 04:20.079
Beautiful.

04:20.589 --> 04:21.579
Lunch.

04:25.010 --> 04:26.000
Hey.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.756
Thank you for understanding.

04:28.220 --> 04:30.097
And now that,
you know, we're all cool,

04:30.220 --> 04:31.881
I'd love to make it up to you guys.

04:32.020 --> 04:33.806
Maybe I could bring over
some burgers,

04:33.940 --> 04:35.260
crank up the BBQ.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.720
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.100
Sure. Why not

04:38.230 --> 04:40.813
-Because... no.
-OK.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.101
-It is our house now.
-OK.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.278
OK Know what?

04:45.410 --> 04:47.731
-Paint the house puke yellow.
-Damn right I will.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.999
My dad, he busted his ass for 30
years paying for those rose bushes.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.031
I don't give a shit about your dad!

04:53.160 --> 04:54.992
You know what, man What?

04:55.580 --> 04:57.457
-Oh, my God!
-Out of the way!

04:57.580 --> 04:58.741
Put down the pepper spray.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.918
-Tell me about your strengths.
-My strengths?

05:06.390 --> 05:08.540
Well, as you can see,
my test scores indicate

05:08.680 --> 05:11.559
that my strengths are certainly not
PowerPoint or Excel.

05:14.690 --> 05:15.680
OK.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.605
If you don't hear from me
in the next... six or seven weeks,

05:22.030 --> 05:23.930
feel free to give me a call.

05:27.110 --> 05:28.908
-Your rsum for me?
-Yeah, here you go.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.907
Stone walked halfway
across the bridge.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.576
Down below, moonlight shimmered

05:33.700 --> 05:36.078
on the dark waters
of the Vitava River.

05:36.210 --> 05:39.032
The cocaine was wearing off
and the night felt empty.

05:39.170 --> 05:41.081
Now more than ever--

05:45.510 --> 05:46.921
Two grand. It's all there.

05:48.050 --> 05:50.633
Hey, didn't you play fullback
at Poly?

05:50.760 --> 05:52.250
I played baseball at Poly.

05:52.390 --> 05:55.519
My senior year, I was All-CIF.
Well, you know, honorable mention.

05:57.230 --> 05:58.265
You need a helmet!

06:38.520 --> 06:40.147
Hey. How's Larry?

06:40.270 --> 06:41.897
Heard he's back in the hospital.

06:42.020 --> 06:44.261
He's fine. Getting all fixed up.

06:44.690 --> 06:46.351
It's weird seeing you out here alone.

06:48.820 --> 06:51.278
You know, if anything happens,

06:51.410 --> 06:53.117
come see me about a memorial bench.

06:54.450 --> 06:57.613
Listen, man, he's not dead, OK?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.706
You're next, Ernie.

06:59.830 --> 07:02.128
-What?
-Tee's open. You're up.

07:07.670 --> 07:11.083
I got three calls this morning
before 10 a.m. I'm sick of it.

07:12.010 --> 07:13.171
You're past due.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.634
You're already garnishing my wages.
What more do you want from me?

07:19.850 --> 07:22.683
Your monthly payments went up.
Didn't you get our letters?

07:22.810 --> 07:24.107
No, I burned them.

07:25.020 --> 07:27.603
I don't know what else to say.
You signed the agreement.

07:27.730 --> 07:31.234
No, I co-signed to help my dad.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.692
He didn't say things were bad,
then he checked out.

07:36.030 --> 07:37.941
He died and left me with this mess.

07:38.450 --> 07:39.611
I'm so sorry.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.871
It's 80 grand. It could be worse.

07:47.670 --> 07:48.705
Do you have debt?

07:50.340 --> 07:51.330
Student loans.

07:51.470 --> 07:54.041
Luckily, I was able to defer those
for a long time.

07:54.970 --> 07:57.098
You took out loans
to become a loan officer?

07:57.220 --> 07:58.210
Yeah.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.477
Well done. You're living the dream.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.057
Well, if you think
things are bad now,

08:03.190 --> 08:05.852
wait until we sell your debt
to a third-party collector.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.435
What?

08:07.570 --> 08:08.640
Unless you catch up,

08:08.780 --> 08:10.771
it will happen
in the next month or so.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.813
I promise you, those guys
will make your life a living hell.

08:14.740 --> 08:15.730
I promise you.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.283
Thank you for coming in.
Take a mug if you'd like.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.030
They're free.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.391
Hello.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.602
You've reached the Lynx Lodge 49.

08:47.730 --> 08:49.061
Please leave a message.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.560
Hey.

08:50.690 --> 08:52.067
Is anyone in there?

08:52.190 --> 08:55.353
It's Dud again.
You know, from the other night.

08:56.280 --> 08:59.523
I kind of wish you guys
would post your hours.

09:00.450 --> 09:03.613
Anyway, listen,
Ernie, if you get this,

09:03.750 --> 09:07.323
I'm ready to get started on my
journey toward knighthood

09:07.460 --> 09:09.337
or squiredom,

09:09.460 --> 09:10.541
or whatever.

09:11.210 --> 09:12.450
Anyway,

09:12.590 --> 09:16.333
I'm sure you guys have got
more important things going on,

09:16.470 --> 09:17.460
SO...

09:17.590 --> 09:19.638
I hope Larry's doing better. OK.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.421
Call me back. It's Dud.

09:33.030 --> 09:35.772
Here you go, guys. Whenever
you're ready. Thank you so much.

09:35.900 --> 09:36.901
Thanks.

09:37.820 --> 09:39.697
-Jeremy wants you in his office.
-Why?

09:45.370 --> 09:47.168
-Hey. You wanted to see me?
-Hey.

09:47.870 --> 09:50.874
Sarah says
that this looks... ridiculous.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.126
What do you think?

09:52.630 --> 09:54.337
I mean, she told our therapist.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.048
Our therapist!
She couldn't tell me directly!

09:57.510 --> 09:59.296
That's part of the problem, right?

09:59.720 --> 10:02.212
It's really busy.
I should probably be out there.

10:02.350 --> 10:04.341
No, no, no.
Just, if you could, you know...

10:04.470 --> 10:05.471
Sit. Come.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.260
So...

10:10.400 --> 10:11.890
You can guess what this is about.

10:13.820 --> 10:15.185
They were gonna get rotten.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.140
I figured
I might as well just take them.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.368
-Take what?
-The avocados.

10:20.490 --> 10:21.525
You steal avocados?

10:22.950 --> 10:24.532
-Yes.
-I don't care.

10:24.910 --> 10:26.457
Take them. They're good fat.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.161
So why am I here?

10:30.250 --> 10:31.740
Look, this is hard. OK.

10:33.170 --> 10:35.377
I've decided to promote Karen

10:35.510 --> 10:37.330
to assistant manager.

10:38.510 --> 10:39.329
That's fine.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.256
I know you've been here for a year

10:41.390 --> 10:44.382
and she's only been here for three
months, but it is all political.

10:44.850 --> 10:46.761
Omni HQ likes Karen

10:46.890 --> 10:49.473
because... she did the calendar.

10:49.900 --> 10:53.018
But I told them that you were the
best we had in terms of brute labor.

10:53.150 --> 10:56.029
Jeremy, seriously, it's fine.
I don't want a promotion.

10:56.150 --> 10:58.448
-Why not?
-Because the bank will take it.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.527
I need to be on tables.
I need the cash.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.197
That's a relief. I thought
you were gonna be mad at me.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.037
No. Never.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.286
Bring it in for a hug.

11:07.160 --> 11:07.991
No.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.326
OK. Fair enough.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.747
But, listen,
we also hired a new girl.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.626
Or... young woman.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.299
She's gonna be shadowing you
this week.

11:16.420 --> 11:17.251
OK.

11:17.380 --> 11:20.008
And I told her that she's gonna be
working with Liz Dudley.

11:21.130 --> 11:22.427
Queen of Shamroxx.

11:26.100 --> 11:28.387
Long story short,
it's a bit of a mess.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.841
Obviously, Mooch buys a lot of china,

11:31.980 --> 11:33.516
so we need to fix this ASAP.

11:33.650 --> 11:36.108
You mean, I need to fix this.
Mooch is my customer.

11:36.230 --> 11:38.062
Exactly.
That's why I'm counting on you.

11:38.190 --> 11:40.318
Why the hell
would you quote him that price?

11:40.450 --> 11:41.440
Are you insane?

11:41.570 --> 11:44.119
I don't know. It was me and Mooch
like the old days.

11:44.240 --> 11:48.154
Paradise Lounge
has that happy hour with the oysters.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.610
We were having a blast.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.203
-I didn't want to ruin the mood.
-So now I get to jump on the grenade.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.587
Thank you for your service
to our country.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.298
OK, next item on the agenda.

11:58.420 --> 12:01.629
Gleeson Pipe is sponsoring
a sport fishing day -

12:01.760 --> 12:04.673
some charter boat
out to San Clemente Island.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.802
It's a big jerk-off
for their plumbers.

12:06.930 --> 12:09.922
They've reserved a spot for me
and one more.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.268
-What do you say, Beautiful Jeff?
-I'm in.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.893
I make the ultimate sacrifice
and Beautiful Jeff goes on a cruise?

12:18.020 --> 12:19.146
Yes, old piece of shit.

12:19.650 --> 12:21.948
Beautiful Jeff
is having a better year than you.

12:22.070 --> 12:25.904
Only because he's slinging Pex to all
the Korean export guys in Cerritos.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.362
Pex Pipe is the future.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.407
I'm the future. You'll be dead soon.

12:31.540 --> 12:33.360
Pex Pipe is lightweight garbage.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.990
That's why you can sell it.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.120
"Lightweight."

12:37.210 --> 12:38.200
Look at this.

12:39.170 --> 12:40.501
That's all cosmetic.

12:40.630 --> 12:41.836
You're a mannequin.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.086
This is the real thing.

12:45.220 --> 12:48.963
Right here. Real human man flesh!

12:49.350 --> 12:50.670
Fine. Let's do this.

12:50.810 --> 12:52.676
Do more than me,
you can take the cruise.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.339
Yeah.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.063
Easy-peasy... bitch.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.641
-All right.
-Here we go.

13:02.150 --> 13:03.891
Come on, man.
I could do this all day!

13:07.240 --> 13:08.526
Can't do it.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.709
Impressive, Ernie. I thought
you would have a heart attack.

13:13.830 --> 13:15.787
-Not bad for an old man.
-Thanks.

13:16.290 --> 13:17.951
Have fun on the high seas.

13:19.750 --> 13:20.740
Hey.

13:21.130 --> 13:22.757
Where's my commission check?

13:22.880 --> 13:23.961
Any day now.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.541
You're still my butter and egg man.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.353
-Here we go, pistols at dawn.
-Come on now, Mooch.

13:39.770 --> 13:41.977
You know _
we can't give you that price.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.310
It's too late.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.989
I already quoted Bob's price
to Glen at TC Mechanical,

13:46.110 --> 13:49.239
and he wants to put in a big order,
so the market is set.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.735
God damn it.

13:52.910 --> 13:54.651
I'll take the hit with the factory,

13:54.790 --> 13:55.780
OK?

13:59.210 --> 14:02.999
So, I hear you know something
about the Orbis redevelopment.

14:03.130 --> 14:04.120
No.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.792
I'm just riding rumors
like everyone else.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.881
What are you hearing?

14:09.010 --> 14:11.388
Everybody's waiting
for Captain's smoke signals.

14:11.510 --> 14:15.799
If I could just chase Captain down,
I could get our lines spec'd early.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.595
Good luck!

14:17.730 --> 14:21.894
Every plumber and wholesaler in SoCal
is gonna be chasing this project.

14:22.440 --> 14:23.566
It's the Holy Grail.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.902
Got this in '81 at the Cuckoo's Nest.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.612
I was 13.

14:30.740 --> 14:33.482
My older brother snuck me in.
We went mad dog in the pit.

14:34.370 --> 14:37.112
Then, after the show,
a couple of skinheads jumped us.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.662
One of them had a knife.

14:39.540 --> 14:40.530
He got me.

14:41.170 --> 14:43.958
And my brother lit his ass up
with a piece of rebar.

14:45.550 --> 14:46.665
It all evens out.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.172
So that's Champ.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.508
And this is Gerson.
He's bussing our section today.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.211
If he slacks,
feel free to screw him on tips.

14:56.350 --> 14:57.476
And I don't slack...

14:57.600 --> 15:00.058
unless I'm high
or having weird emotions.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.642
OK, let's go. Kill floor awaits.

15:02.770 --> 15:04.977
You're in great hands, Heather.
Liz is the best.

15:06.110 --> 15:08.101
So, did you read the training manual?

15:08.240 --> 15:10.231
Grooming standards and all that?

15:10.360 --> 15:11.441
I did, yes.

15:11.570 --> 15:14.653
This is a place of glamor and fun.

15:14.780 --> 15:15.986
Never forget that.

15:16.120 --> 15:19.203
"Moments of truth in service."

15:19.330 --> 15:21.992
Oh, I know. It's just high-level
corporate poetry.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.373
It just means
anticipating the needs of customers.

15:25.500 --> 15:29.414
So, in about five minutes, those guys
are going to want another pitcher,

15:29.550 --> 15:32.679
and knowing that
is my Shamroxx moment of truth.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.052
Someday you might have
one of your own,

15:35.180 --> 15:36.170
Oh, yeah!

15:37.930 --> 15:40.388
-So, are you in school?
-I am.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.182
I'm actually taking business classes
at Golden West.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.813
My cousin and I
are going to open a hair salon.

15:46.900 --> 15:47.935
Entrepreneurs.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.566
Oh, we're trying.

15:50.610 --> 15:51.600
So, what about you?

15:52.200 --> 15:54.407
-What are you doing?
-I'm working here.

16:00.870 --> 16:03.498
The nurses we talked to
seemed... worried.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.338
Larry's not responding well.
He's still really out of it.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.252
Those doctors are useless.

16:09.380 --> 16:12.509
They refused to administer
the supplements I provided,

16:12.630 --> 16:14.212
so I had to do it sub rosa.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.751
How is he with you, Ernie?

16:15.890 --> 16:16.800
Me?

16:16.930 --> 16:17.920
Fine.

16:18.470 --> 16:22.020
I mean, I haven't had a chance
to go over since the surgery.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.430
I've been busy.

16:27.150 --> 16:28.936
Besides, it's just bypass surgery.

16:29.070 --> 16:30.777
-Quadruple bypass.
-Yeah.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.447
They knock those out every day.

16:32.570 --> 16:34.060
Larry's gonna be fine.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.537
I'm going tomorrow afternoon.

16:38.910 --> 16:42.244
I'm sorry, Ernie, but I think
we've got to prepare for the worst.

16:42.370 --> 16:46.034
Yeah, I went to Harbor Municipal.
I put a deposit on a memorial bench.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.160
What?

16:47.290 --> 16:49.622
No, stop it.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.798
You guys
are trying to bury him alive.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.297
You haven't seen him, Ernie.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.330
Then there's everything
happening here.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.592
We've got to get in touch
with London,

16:57.720 --> 16:59.131
let them know what's going on.

16:59.260 --> 17:02.389
Ernie, there are strict protocols
for appointing a new SP.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.635
Just listen.

17:03.770 --> 17:06.340
I wasn't supposed to say anything,
but last week

17:06.480 --> 17:08.471
Larry told me he's stepping down.

17:08.859 --> 17:11.568
He's finally making me
Sovereign Protector.

17:11.690 --> 17:13.351
No way!

17:13.490 --> 17:14.638
Congratulations!

17:14.780 --> 17:16.020
Love you, too.

17:17.450 --> 17:19.327
OK, yeah. Way to go, man.

17:19.450 --> 17:22.499
Yeah, but, I mean, London
should still be involved, right?

17:22.619 --> 17:23.826
I mean, they might... Hey.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.281
Look, there are other
worthy candidates.

17:27.420 --> 17:30.412
I'm saying we shouldn't get
too far ahead of ourselves.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.668
If it will make you feel better,
Scott, I'll call London

17:33.800 --> 17:35.791
and we'll sort it all out, OK?

17:36.430 --> 17:37.545
Anything else?

17:39.600 --> 17:42.092
Sean Dudley called.
Left another message.

17:42.220 --> 17:44.348
-Are you gonna be working with him?
-I guess so.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.801
-We mentioned it the other night.
-I'd reach out.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.430
He might lose interest.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.562
These are fish bones. Look at this.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.696
Oh, my gosh!

17:55.820 --> 17:57.606
As far down as you can see.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.150
Lizard.

18:04.620 --> 18:06.497
They gave me a restraining order.

18:06.620 --> 18:08.076
Jesus. For how long?

18:08.210 --> 18:09.200
Three years.

18:09.710 --> 18:12.088
The judge said their attacks on me
were justified.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.917
I told you to let me come with you.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.962
Because you were a paralegal
for ten minutes?

18:17.090 --> 18:19.548
Because I could have helped.
You need help, Dud.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.670
Look...

18:21.760 --> 18:23.171
It's been a year, OK?

18:23.310 --> 18:24.926
-It's time--
-Well, you know what?

18:25.060 --> 18:27.688
You can't have a funeral
without a body, so shut it.

18:27.810 --> 18:29.346
There will never be a body, OK?

18:29.480 --> 18:31.016
It's not an excuse any more.

18:31.770 --> 18:32.896
What are you doing?

18:34.690 --> 18:35.521
Dud.

18:36.690 --> 18:37.987
Get out of my room.

18:38.110 --> 18:41.489
I am so tired
of your depressing shit.

18:41.910 --> 18:44.618
-I don't need help. You need help.
-I don't need help!

18:44.740 --> 18:47.823
I took responsibility like an adult!

18:48.370 --> 18:49.781
And guess what, Dud?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.991
It was depressing,

18:52.130 --> 18:54.246
but you... don't... get...

18:54.380 --> 18:55.370
a...

18:56.050 --> 18:57.040
pass!

19:27.580 --> 19:28.706
Lodge 1, London.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.029
Hi.

19:30.160 --> 19:33.289
I'm Ernie Fontaine,
the Luminous Knight at Lodge 49

19:33.420 --> 19:34.706
in Long Beach, California.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.239
Oh... yeah.

19:36.380 --> 19:38.872
Lodge 49, one of our success stories.

19:39.010 --> 19:39.829
What?

19:39.970 --> 19:42.758
You have one of the most robust
memberships in North America.

19:45.640 --> 19:46.630
OK.

19:47.100 --> 19:49.979
I'm calling because we're about
to go through a succession.

19:50.100 --> 19:53.058
I think our Sovereign Protector,
Larry Loomis, has been in touch.

19:53.190 --> 19:55.431
He's stepping down
and giving me the throne.

19:55.570 --> 19:56.560
I see.

19:56.690 --> 19:59.682
We haven't heard from Mr. Loomis,
but thank you for telling us.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.230
Really?

20:01.820 --> 20:04.152
Well, what happens now?

20:04.530 --> 20:06.828
You guys send out
an emissary, right?

20:08.120 --> 20:10.748
Wherever possible
we like to oversee transitions.

20:10.870 --> 20:13.874
You can expect a visitor
in the next few weeks.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.953
Until then, take care, Mr. Fontaine.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.540
And congratulations.

20:19.670 --> 20:20.660
Thank you.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.456
One, two,

20:56.580 --> 20:58.036
three, four,

20:58.170 --> 21:00.548
five, six, seven,

21:00.670 --> 21:02.081
eight, nine,

21:02.220 --> 21:04.120
40, 41, 42.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.590
It's open.

21:15.140 --> 21:18.360
I just had a call from Lodge 49
in California.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.720
They're doing succession.

21:21.150 --> 21:22.140
OK.

21:22.650 --> 21:24.106
I just sent Anil to Marseille,

21:24.240 --> 21:26.777
and Clara has her surgery,
so I guess I'm sending you.

21:30.540 --> 21:31.530
OK.

21:31.910 --> 21:33.071
Is there a problem?

21:34.410 --> 21:35.411
No, it's...

21:36.250 --> 21:38.321
just a very long flight, and...

21:39.790 --> 21:41.497
I have tickets to the Ashes.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.713
Jocelyn, when we made you
an emissary, it was understood--

21:44.840 --> 21:46.217
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

21:46.340 --> 21:48.843
I'll start the paperwork immediately.

21:53.020 --> 21:56.138
One, two, three, four, five...

21:57.310 --> 21:59.221
We're a manufacturer's rep.

22:00.020 --> 22:03.934
Basically, the middle man between
the factory and the wholesaler.

22:04.530 --> 22:05.520
But...

22:05.650 --> 22:07.857
I spend a lot of time
chasing down plumbers,

22:07.990 --> 22:10.982
trying to get them to buy our lines
from the wholesaler.

22:11.780 --> 22:14.112
Anyway, we rep 20 lines.

22:15.540 --> 22:16.530
Toilets, faucets,

22:16.660 --> 22:18.662
brass, PVC pumps.

22:19.000 --> 22:19.819
Nice.

22:19.960 --> 22:22.998
It's not as exciting as it sounds,
but it used to be.

22:23.630 --> 22:25.962
Before the crash,
I could write business all day.

22:26.420 --> 22:28.832
Now everything is just a hustle.

22:29.970 --> 22:32.132
-What kind of pumps do you sell?
-Morley.

22:32.260 --> 22:34.308
Morley? Yeah. It's a good line.

22:34.430 --> 22:35.727
It's easy to install.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.392
So you don't work
on pools at all any more?

22:39.520 --> 22:40.510
No.

22:40.980 --> 22:42.141
No, I...

22:42.270 --> 22:43.726
All my gear got liquidated.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.779
So... And I can't do
heavy maintenance with my foot.

22:47.900 --> 22:48.947
-Right.
-Yeah.

22:49.070 --> 22:50.401
But it's cool, you know.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.232
I just need to find something
to keep me busy...

22:54.830 --> 22:56.116
until I figure out how to...

22:56.910 --> 22:58.366
how to get my dad's shop back.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.490
So...

23:03.130 --> 23:04.416
your postulancy.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.871
Yes, my postulancy. So, what's next?

23:07.010 --> 23:10.219
Well, we'll keep meeting up,
and you'll need to track down Blaise.

23:10.340 --> 23:13.640
He'll get you started on the alchemy
and philosophical stuff.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.808
There are a few things
you need to memorize.

23:15.930 --> 23:18.171
But, honestly,
you could take it or leave it.

23:18.310 --> 23:19.436
Most people leave it.

23:20.100 --> 23:22.102
How long does it take
to become a squire?

23:22.230 --> 23:24.972
-Like, a few months or weeks or...?
-Well, it depends.

23:25.110 --> 23:27.738
Once we can see
that you are dedicated,

23:27.860 --> 23:30.909
there's a whole secret ceremony.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.696
Cool, a secret...

23:32.820 --> 23:34.276
What happens at the ceremony?

23:34.870 --> 23:36.360
Well, I can't tell you that.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.452
But, basically,
there's a solemn oath...

23:40.120 --> 23:44.239
and then we will begin
to entrust you with the mysteries.

23:44.380 --> 23:46.417
Entrusted with the mysteries.

23:47.090 --> 23:48.080
That's...

23:48.420 --> 23:50.411
That's so cool.
That's all I ever wanted.

23:50.550 --> 23:53.463
We usually order a pizza
or something afterwards.

23:53.590 --> 23:54.637
Cool.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.137
Thank you for everything.

23:56.930 --> 23:58.420
-Thank you, Dud.
-And...

23:58.930 --> 24:00.591
tell Larry hello for me.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.056
Actually, I've got a work emergency.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.931
Is there a chance...

24:07.650 --> 24:09.106
If you're not doing anything,

24:09.240 --> 24:11.026
could you go by and see Larry?

24:12.110 --> 24:13.407
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

24:13.530 --> 24:14.816
Maybe read a book to him?

24:14.950 --> 24:17.078
Yeah. Yeah, that would be no problem.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.032
If Larry hits me,
I'll just hit him back.

24:22.870 --> 24:23.951
There you go.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.320
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.006
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:31.920 --> 24:35.333
You are the first guy under 50
I've seen check out one of these.

24:36.010 --> 24:38.217
Oh, it's not for me.

24:38.350 --> 24:40.307
It's for a friend.
He's an old Vietham vet.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.978
-See? The old guys love Tom Stone.
-Yeah.

24:43.100 --> 24:45.899
He's a boxer,
an art dealer and a secret agent.

24:50.900 --> 24:51.890
OK.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.350
Enjoy.

24:53.780 --> 24:54.770
Yeah.

24:56.870 --> 24:57.860
Hi.

25:01.450 --> 25:03.999
"At midnight,
Pavel entered the lobby.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.990
It was now or never.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.700
Stone reached into his overcoat,

25:07.840 --> 25:10.662
took the safety off his .228
just in case.”

25:11.460 --> 25:13.929
The True Lodge sent you.

25:17.300 --> 25:18.290
Ernie did.

25:20.470 --> 25:22.097
I'm... I'm Sean.

25:24.140 --> 25:26.017
You met me at the Lodge
the other night.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.140
Do you remember?

25:28.650 --> 25:31.028
Remember, you... you really...

25:32.110 --> 25:33.896
And I thought she was crazy.

25:34.030 --> 25:35.316
I didn't believe her.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.310
Who?

25:38.370 --> 25:39.576
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:40.160 --> 25:43.369
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, Ernie told me to come by, so...

25:43.500 --> 25:44.570
Really?

25:44.710 --> 25:46.997
Well, that's incredibly nice of you.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.161
Is... Is Ernie coming?

25:49.630 --> 25:52.622
-No. No, he's got a work thing.
-Work.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.750
-Yeah.
-Right.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.120
-Yeah.
-Ernie.

25:55.930 --> 25:58.217
I need to talk to Ernie.

25:58.340 --> 25:59.466
He's not here, Lar.

25:59.970 --> 26:01.677
But, hey, he told us the news.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.801
-He did?
-Oh, don't worry. No, no, no.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.513
He's gonna call London
and take care of everything.

26:07.730 --> 26:08.891
You just need to rest.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.432
You don't need to stay.
I'm just gonna sit here and work.

26:15.030 --> 26:16.236
I'll keep him company.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.526
OK, yeah. Good idea.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.993
Hey, does Larry have any family
that ever stops by?

26:25.370 --> 26:27.532
No. He's an old bachelor.

26:28.330 --> 26:30.788
He doesn't have any family,
just the Lodge.

26:33.170 --> 26:34.251
All right, well...

26:34.380 --> 26:35.370
See you, Lar.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.121
Hey, Liz!

27:54.340 --> 27:55.330
I...

27:55.880 --> 27:58.588
I got some toilet paper.
I used the coupon you gave me.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.586
Hey... Hey, Liz?

28:07.220 --> 28:09.302
Hey, Liz, I got the toilet paper.

28:11.140 --> 28:12.130
Liz?

28:20.950 --> 28:22.486
What do you want to do for dinner?

28:33.920 --> 28:36.662
He's a...
He's a really, really nice guy, too.

28:36.790 --> 28:39.703
It's funny, we both have a background
in residential hydronics.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.751
Yes! More parasailing!

28:43.220 --> 28:46.679
That is the only way you can truly
get to know someone.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.808
But it sounds like Ernie
deals more with fixtures like...

28:50.640 --> 28:52.722
faucets, sinks, toilets -
that kind of thing.

28:54.190 --> 28:55.476
Get ready, Caitlin,

28:55.600 --> 28:58.262
for the greatest adventure
of your life.

29:05.780 --> 29:07.737
Liz, I think I've got a crush
on somebody.

29:08.490 --> 29:10.447
You are not Caitlin's type.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.202
No. No, not Caitlin. It's...

29:14.830 --> 29:16.070
It's for real. It's...

29:16.710 --> 29:18.087
She works at the library.

29:20.670 --> 29:22.252
A librarian.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.171
Yeah, I know. It's awful.

29:25.630 --> 29:26.711
Is she mousy?

29:27.220 --> 29:28.346
How mousy is she?

29:29.350 --> 29:30.636
Is she an actual mouse?

29:30.760 --> 29:32.421
Yes, she's an actual mouse.

29:32.850 --> 29:35.057
This is progress.
You're rejoining the world.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.009
Yeah.

29:36.520 --> 29:37.851
Have you talked to her yet?

29:39.940 --> 29:41.351
Just today.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.481
OK.

29:43.190 --> 29:44.567
I'm afraid if I keep going back,

29:44.700 --> 29:47.909
she's gonna think I'm some sort of
creepy stalker person.

29:48.660 --> 29:52.449
Well, you do have a restraining order
against you, so...

29:52.580 --> 29:55.288
It's for civil harassment,
so that's different.

29:55.410 --> 29:56.491
The best kind.

29:58.790 --> 29:59.780
Yeah.

30:02.130 --> 30:03.620
It's just been so long.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.120
I guess I just stopped...

30:07.050 --> 30:09.132
thinking about
that sort of thing this year.

30:09.850 --> 30:10.840
Yeah.

30:12.350 --> 30:13.590
I know what you mean.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.427
And, to be honest,

30:15.560 --> 30:17.380
it's been a while since I...

30:21.320 --> 30:22.310
You know.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.020
You know.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.368
Listen to me,
you just need to get it over with.

30:29.820 --> 30:31.948
Go up to the desk and ask her out.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.367
-Be direct.
-Yeah.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.827
OK. Yeah, direct.

30:38.830 --> 30:40.127
I'm telling you,

30:40.250 --> 30:42.742
something's going on at Orbis.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.370
I want to go after Captain.

30:46.130 --> 30:48.462
If we can get with him
on this Orbis deal--

30:48.590 --> 30:51.890
Come on, Ernie.
You're never gonna get to Captain.

30:52.010 --> 30:53.500
He lives in a different world.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.426
Developers, architects.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.221
With these big-money guys at the top,

30:57.350 --> 31:00.012
it's all shadows
and secret handshakes.

31:00.520 --> 31:01.646
That's not us.

31:02.230 --> 31:03.516
We're simple men.

31:04.230 --> 31:07.029
We just need to keep
our wholesalers happy.

31:07.990 --> 31:10.402
-What are you trying to prove?
-Nothing.

31:11.410 --> 31:13.902
Is this because you got torched
by Beautiful Jeff?

31:14.290 --> 31:15.325
I don't know.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.616
I just need this.

31:22.290 --> 31:24.088
I'm tired of the nickel and dime.

31:24.460 --> 31:26.667
These big projects
just never pan out.

31:28.630 --> 31:30.587
I'm just saving you a ton of hassle.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.170
OK.

31:36.270 --> 31:37.260
Thank you.

31:39.980 --> 31:41.436
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:41.560 --> 31:42.550
I'm Sean.

31:44.020 --> 31:45.647
I came in here yesterday.

31:47.820 --> 31:49.106
What can I help you with?

32:01.580 --> 32:02.957
-Hi.
-Hi.

32:05.130 --> 32:06.746
Hey, did you hear?

32:06.880 --> 32:09.508
Somebody found a seal
wandering down Willow Street.

32:09.630 --> 32:10.586
Really?

32:11.130 --> 32:13.428
I guess he got lost
and swam up the channel.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.553
O Animal Rescue
said it happened a few times now.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.762
Something about
rising water temperatures.

32:22.810 --> 32:23.800
I'll be right back.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.180
This is 900 square feet.

32:26.730 --> 32:28.607
-Really?
-Yeah, give or take.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.947
Hello, gentlemen.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.270
Hi, Sean.

32:37.160 --> 32:41.040
Colby, this is Sean Dudley.
His dad was the previous tenant.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.150
Cool.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.320
Yeah. So...

32:45.170 --> 32:46.285
what kind of...

32:46.420 --> 32:48.240
what kind of shop
are you opening here?

32:48.380 --> 32:49.666
Vape lounge.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.371
Nice! Vape lounge. Vape city.

32:53.260 --> 32:54.830
Love it.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.216
Just what we need...

32:57.350 --> 32:58.749
in this town...

33:00.220 --> 33:03.679
is one more vape lounge.

33:07.440 --> 33:08.475
Hey. How's it going?

33:08.610 --> 33:09.600
OK, thanks.

33:09.730 --> 33:12.108
Heather's a natural.
She doesn't need me any more.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.275
Oh, my God!

33:15.410 --> 33:18.402
Jeremy, who is this?

33:18.530 --> 33:19.531
This is Floyd.

33:19.660 --> 33:22.072
Hi! He's beautiful. Can I hold him?

33:22.500 --> 33:23.490
Sure.

33:23.620 --> 33:25.247
Get under his arms, right there.

33:27.710 --> 33:29.587
-Hello!
-Got him? OK.

33:29.710 --> 33:32.668
-Heather, your order's up.
-Hey, can you hold him for a sec?

33:33.090 --> 33:34.080
No.

33:36.590 --> 33:39.093
-I don't like holding babies.
-Oh, come on.

33:39.220 --> 33:40.847
Look how cute he is!

33:43.390 --> 33:45.347
You know you want to hold him.

34:02.950 --> 34:03.940
Wonderful.

34:20.260 --> 34:21.341
Where's she going?

34:24.389 --> 34:25.846
What the hell did you say to her?

34:29.650 --> 34:33.223
So, this is Lodge 1 in London,
where Harwood Fritz Merrill's buried?

34:33.360 --> 34:36.148
That's the allegorical picture.

34:36.820 --> 34:39.061
-Merrill actually painted that one.
-Right.

34:39.199 --> 34:40.860
And he's buried with the Golden Book.

34:40.989 --> 34:43.572
The allegorical Golden Book.

34:44.699 --> 34:47.498
Yeah, the one he found in the desert

34:47.620 --> 34:49.918
with all the secret formulas
for alchemy

34:50.040 --> 34:52.202
and the universal elixir
that can turn...

34:53.420 --> 34:55.127
that can turn lead into gold.

34:56.300 --> 34:59.008
That's the allegorical history.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.092
There's a lot of legend
surrounding Merrill.

35:03.010 --> 35:04.000
They're fun,

35:04.140 --> 35:06.928
but we actually know a lot
about the actual man.

35:07.060 --> 35:09.597
He was badly wounded
in the Crimean War,

35:09.730 --> 35:11.971
spent the next ten years
wandering around Europe

35:12.110 --> 35:13.896
and the Mediterranean,

35:14.020 --> 35:16.603
until he went to London
and founded the Order.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.390
For him,

35:18.530 --> 35:20.100
alchemy was a metaphor

35:20.240 --> 35:23.483
for the transformation of the soul.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.906
In alchemy, we ask the question,

35:27.040 --> 35:29.577
how can you get something
from nothing?

35:30.790 --> 35:32.997
So he didn't turn lead into gold?

35:37.800 --> 35:39.006
That's a metaphor.

35:42.970 --> 35:44.040
Listen,

35:44.180 --> 35:47.389
Merrill believed
there were two kinds of alchemists.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.420
First is the charlatan,

35:50.020 --> 35:53.900
who was just looking for
a shortcut to fortune,

35:54.020 --> 35:57.650
and the next was the true philoso--

36:02.570 --> 36:04.527
Are you... Are you OK? That's...

36:07.330 --> 36:10.539
The true philosopher,

36:10.660 --> 36:12.742
who used that world out there

36:12.880 --> 36:15.872
as a beautiful text

36:16.000 --> 36:18.583
just waiting to be deciphered.

36:19.050 --> 36:22.588
We just need to learn
how to look at it...

36:23.340 --> 36:24.887
with the right eyes.

36:26.140 --> 36:26.959
OK?

36:27.970 --> 36:31.929
It's bingo night. I have to set up
the Throne Room for the blue-hairs.

36:32.060 --> 36:33.186
Well, I can help.

36:33.690 --> 36:34.680
OK.

36:39.190 --> 36:41.818
-In here.
-You... need some more...?

36:41.950 --> 36:43.770
No, I'm good, thanks.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.196
Let's see here.

36:58.630 --> 36:59.665
So...

36:59.800 --> 37:02.462
-So this is the Throne Room?
-No, this is the Throne Room.

37:02.590 --> 37:03.671
Oh, yeah.

37:05.470 --> 37:08.178
We'll start with chairs
and then we'll go get the tables.

37:12.520 --> 37:13.510
OK.

37:14.520 --> 37:15.897
I'm glad you're here.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.280
You know, people have a hard time
committing to joining.

37:20.940 --> 37:22.237
Yeah, well, I hate to say it,

37:22.360 --> 37:24.658
but it might help
if you lower your membership fee.

37:24.780 --> 37:25.770
I know.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.560
Two hundred bucks is a little steep.

37:28.990 --> 37:30.230
You mean $2,000.

37:31.410 --> 37:33.208
If it was $2,000,

37:33.330 --> 37:34.570
no one would be here.

38:07.740 --> 38:08.730
What?

38:09.450 --> 38:11.020
There's no place for us to go.

38:17.370 --> 38:21.204
Are you blind?
There's no place for any of us to go!

38:21.880 --> 38:23.416
Honk your little horn again!

38:24.090 --> 38:26.218
There's no place to go!

39:05.590 --> 39:06.580
OK.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.852
Right back the way you came, darling.
Can't miss it.

40:54.610 --> 40:56.112
Hey, there you are.

40:56.530 --> 40:59.443
Bingo night - still a source
of revenue, if you can believe it.

41:00.620 --> 41:03.203
Blaise told me you took off earlier.
Is everything OK?

41:04.170 --> 41:05.820
You owe me two grand.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.882
I never thought you'd show up
with that money.

41:15.010 --> 41:16.080
But you took it.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.671
I've got a commission check coming.

41:20.470 --> 41:21.847
I'm going to pay you back.

41:22.600 --> 41:24.386
I was always going to pay you back.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.010
I don't want your money, Ernie.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.185
Yes, you do.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.311
No.

41:29.400 --> 41:32.233
Put the money in the Lodge
to my dues for the next ten years.

41:32.570 --> 41:33.560
Are you serious?

41:33.990 --> 41:35.810
I want to take the squire oath now.

41:35.950 --> 41:38.328
Absolutely, yeah. Why not?
We can do that next week.

41:38.660 --> 41:41.573
And I want a key so I can come inside
whenever I need to.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.203
-I can't give you a key.
-I want a key, Ernie.

42:05.730 --> 42:07.220
You know, when I'm out there...

42:09.940 --> 42:11.430
I feel like I'm all alone.

42:15.490 --> 42:17.447
And all these things
chasing me, it's...

42:18.780 --> 42:20.691
It's dragons and dickheads.

42:23.790 --> 42:25.155
But it's different in here.

42:30.540 --> 42:32.417
I can see what this place is.

42:34.210 --> 42:35.291
I can feel it.

42:38.800 --> 42:39.790
Can't you?

42:58.030 --> 43:00.237
...please call extension 2-2-1-9,

43:00.370 --> 43:03.078
Dr. Tolliver, extension 2-2-1-9.

43:12.290 --> 43:13.451
They must have moved him.

43:18.630 --> 43:21.429
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where you guys moved Larry Loomis?

43:21.850 --> 43:24.717
He checked himself out an hour ago.
Said he was going to Egypt.

43:25.060 --> 43:27.267
You let him walk out of here
in that condition?

43:27.810 --> 43:29.881
-Patient's rights.
-Told you.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.220
The dude's immortal.

43:35.730 --> 43:36.731
Hey, it's Dad.

43:36.860 --> 43:38.988
Just calling to say hi, you know.

43:39.110 --> 43:40.692
No biggie. Call me back.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.440
Lizard, hey!

43:43.950 --> 43:45.486
Dud leaves for his trip tomorrow.

43:45.620 --> 43:48.078
Thought we'd start up the grill,
do a little send-off.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.749
I know it's a hassle driving
up here, but I would love--

43:52.630 --> 43:53.620
Hey.

43:54.460 --> 43:55.450
Hey.
