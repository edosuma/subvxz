LUCY:
Previously on Killjoys...

00:04.130 --> 00:05.916
Hi.
Hi.

00:06.007 --> 00:08.589
I present Sylas
and Evi Robbel

00:08.676 --> 00:09.916
of Land Robbel.

00:10.011 --> 00:12.172
Primary benefactors
of this prison.

00:12.263 --> 00:13.298
Here we go.

00:13.389 --> 00:17.177
D'avin Jaqobis,
experienced prison fighter.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.183
Pass.
What?

00:19.812 --> 00:20.801
(GASPS)

00:20.897 --> 00:22.558
What? What,
did you see it?

00:22.648 --> 00:24.104
It's my dad.
He's in trouble.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.557
KHLYEN: You tell me how
I can find the others,

00:25.776 --> 00:27.562
and I promise you
a quick death.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.310
You're giving up
that easy, Kin Rit?

00:29.530 --> 00:31.111
Dutch would skin
your ass for it.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.188
Yala's dead.

00:32.283 --> 00:34.239
Never sticks.
Family trait.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.074
Do you want me to stay?

00:36.454 --> 00:37.660
JOHN: So you love Dutch.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.078
Figure of speech.

00:39.165 --> 00:41.030
So how long can
these hatchlings survive

00:41.125 --> 00:42.365
on Westerley's surface?

00:42.460 --> 00:44.041
Long enough to scare
the shit out of you.

00:44.128 --> 00:46.619
We need to prep
for a ground fight.

00:46.714 --> 00:47.829
You sold everyone out.

00:47.924 --> 00:50.290
I had a chance to save you,
and I took it.

00:50.468 --> 00:52.049
THE LADY:
You still miss them?
Your daughters?

00:52.261 --> 00:55.298
Yes. They were
the stars I followed.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.471
I could give you more
than they ever could.

00:59.185 --> 01:00.800
I will
give you a galaxy.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.241

01:44.605 --> 01:46.311
Go, go!
Move it!

01:59.829 --> 02:01.319
So it ends...

02:03.082 --> 02:04.538
And so it begins.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.162
We need to talk about
what you promised.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.713
What I promised?
Yes.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.673
lbeHeve
your exact words were,

02:11.966 --> 02:13.706
"I will
give you a galaxy."

02:14.468 --> 02:16.959
That was what you call
a figure of speech.

02:17.263 --> 02:21.222
I will have a galaxy,
so you will have a galaxy.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.346
I didn't take it that way.
Hmm.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.598
But my needs are
much smaller than that.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.146
Give me a planet,
just one.

02:29.692 --> 02:31.353
Say... Qresh.

02:31.861 --> 02:33.192
Qresh?
Mmm-hmm.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.397
VVhy?

02:35.031 --> 02:37.363
Nice to have my old home
again, I suppose.

02:37.450 --> 02:39.031
Humans are sentimental
like that.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.784
(MUTTERS UNDER BREATH)
lfyou love Qresh so much,
why don't you marry it?

02:42.955 --> 02:44.240
What was that?

02:45.041 --> 02:46.156
Nothing.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.239
Ah.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.868
You can have Qresh,
for now,

02:51.172 --> 02:54.084
but if this doesn't
work, Khlyen,

02:54.467 --> 02:56.458
I will be starting over
in another system,

02:56.552 --> 02:58.918
and I won't leave
anything behind.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.798
Not even Qresh.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.505
Understood.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.677
But why
wouldn't it work?

03:05.686 --> 03:06.721
Are you nervous?

03:06.812 --> 03:08.643
I do not get nervous.

03:09.482 --> 03:10.722
You're on the cusp
of achieving

03:10.816 --> 03:12.556
everything you've
worked towards
for centuries.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.562
Apprehension
isn't surprising.

03:15.738 --> 03:16.944

03:21.243 --> 03:23.279
You guys want to call ahead
to the Armada,

03:23.371 --> 03:25.202
get 'em to run me
a nice bath?

03:25.289 --> 03:27.450
I could use a nice soak
before the next round
of beatings.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.826
Whoa, whoa!
lnnocent victim here!

03:32.088 --> 03:34.830
PREE: Victim, maybe,
but I've seen your
sexer bills, Turin.

03:35.091 --> 03:36.627
l'd hardly
call you innocent.

03:37.259 --> 03:39.716
Never thought I'd be
so happy to see
a couple of bartenders.

03:39.804 --> 03:42.591
Wow. They really
beat you up.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.304
Nothing gets by
this one, huh?

03:44.392 --> 03:45.427
Here.
Aah!

03:45.684 --> 03:47.640
We've been
scouting out the lab
you were in for days.

03:47.937 --> 03:49.473
If I was Dutch,
you'd give me a medal.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.894
lfyou were Dutch,
you'd be dead,

03:51.190 --> 03:52.805
along with the rest of
Team Awesome Force.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.936
Dead, how?
Later.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.811
For now, let's get to
the Black Root ship
these assholes came in on

03:58.989 --> 04:00.525
so we can get off
this pissant moon.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.117
No,no,no,
no,no,no.

04:02.201 --> 04:04.157
We can'tjust
abandon Old Town.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.702
We need to get our people
out of those factories

04:06.789 --> 04:08.654
and avenge
Dutch's death.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.989
Uh, Pree?

04:13.963 --> 04:15.794
Well,
that's convenient.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.794
So why doesn't this feel
like a good thing?

04:23.472 --> 04:26.680
DUTCH: D'av and Johnny
have been training teams
from the Herks to sabotage,

04:26.767 --> 04:28.883
infiltrate, and get out
fast and quiet.

04:28.978 --> 04:30.013
The Lady won't know
what's hit her.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.093
How many?

04:31.188 --> 04:33.270
Well, so far,
we have 12 teams.

04:33.357 --> 04:36.064
Twelve teams,
200 factories.

04:36.152 --> 04:37.767
I'd say you need
to train faster.

04:37.862 --> 04:39.648
But what ifjust had
to take out one?

04:39.738 --> 04:40.727
Tell him.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.063
No, you tell him.
You figured it out.

04:42.158 --> 04:43.694
Yeah, you found
all the raw data, so...

04:43.784 --> 04:45.399
Yeah, but you finessed it,
which is really more of the...

04:45.494 --> 04:47.576
Hey,guys,|have
a really fun game.

04:47.663 --> 04:48.948
The first one
who starts talking

04:49.039 --> 04:50.245
doesn't get punched
in the face.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.038
That does sound
like a fun game.

04:52.668 --> 04:55.535
Okay. So, nine days ago,
the people of Old Town

04:55.629 --> 04:56.880
were put
on 24-hour shifts.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.465
Why? Go ahead,
tell 'em.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.085
We assume it was
to maximize output,

05:00.176 --> 05:02.588
which would also explain
why The Lady
slaved all the factories

05:02.678 --> 05:03.838
to the main
Old Town plant.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.214
It gives her
complete control.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.092
And us,
one big fat target.

05:07.183 --> 05:09.094
We hit one factory,
we shut them all down.

05:09.185 --> 05:11.517
Exactly, and no one gets
punched in the face.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.518
Now, that sounds
like a plan.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.318
We need
a pretty big bomb

05:21.405 --> 05:22.736
to hit
that factory with.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.779
There's no way
the Herks has
that kind of firepower.

05:24.867 --> 05:28.451
She also doesn't
usually receive
unannounced guests.

05:30.039 --> 05:31.620
Prison ship,
Killjoys?

05:32.708 --> 05:34.915
It's just a bit on the nose,
don't you think?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.583
Delle Seyah?

05:41.717 --> 05:42.957
Hello, sister.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.176

got out instead.

I'm sorry, that's when
things got complicated.

06:11.622 --> 06:12.657
I know.

06:13.749 --> 06:14.955
It's all right.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.538
How did Jaq even know
where we were?

06:18.629 --> 06:20.915
Our son has many gifts,
unlike his father.

Now, take us to Qresh
so I can
reclaim my place

06:23.634 --> 06:25.090
as Head of the Nine,
gather the armed forces,

06:25.177 --> 06:27.008
and start a proper war
with The Lady.

on the same team now?

06:28.931 --> 06:29.920

a problem with that.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.130
Oh, spare me.

that you're dead?

Westerley now.

That dirt moon?
Why?

06:40.150 --> 06:41.139
Dutch...

06:41.235 --> 06:43.442
Because that dirt moon
is our home.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.895
lthink we should
go to Qresh.

06:46.115 --> 06:47.776
What?
Oh, see?

06:47.866 --> 06:50.778
Even a Jaqobis can
see reason...
eventually.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.655
Not for you, for us.

what we need.

you still have a link.

you were dead.

Well, a bunch
of them, actually.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.835
Everyone's back in Old Town,
and they were told

07:51.930 --> 07:53.921
they didn't need to come back
into work, ever.

is already
at the tipping point,

07:55.601 --> 07:56.636
it means
we're too late.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.968
No. No, if Turin
has enough air
to bust my balls,

there's enough air
in the atmosphere
to reverse the process.

to take down the factory.

lt's risky, but we got
volunteers up here
to make it work.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.728
And I need some readings
from my weather station

08:09.823 --> 08:11.359
to see what's changed
in the air quality.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.907
Go out into the air
to tell you
how bad the air is.

to see first.

We're getting

from this planet,

at us.

have to do this.

Oh, but, Gared,
if this goes bad,

09:10.968 --> 09:12.879
I don't know if I can
come and save you.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.920
Maybe it's my turn
to do the saving.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.641
Oh, I could, uh...

09:22.521 --> 09:24.102
get used to that.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.224
Yeah.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.905
D'AVlN: Let's get
right to it.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.949
We need
military ordnance.

Specifically,
guided missiles,
air-to-surface,

09:41.123 --> 09:42.283
heavy payload.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.705
What would
make you think

09:43.792 --> 09:45.748
that we would have
anything like that?

09:45.836 --> 09:48.202
Because the Robbel clan
is known for two things,

09:48.297 --> 09:50.709
being a bunch of grasping
little parvenus...

09:50.799 --> 09:52.335
Why, thank you.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.338
And for being perfectly happy
selling weapons

09:55.471 --> 09:59.089
to anybody with as much joy
and few scruples as possible.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.095
How much do you
have to spend?

10:02.186 --> 10:04.677
We're a bit short
on joy right now.

10:05.355 --> 10:10.349
Well, there are other ways
we could make this happen.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.398
We should talk about
the big one.

10:14.490 --> 10:15.946
The big one.
The arms.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.989
Definitely him.
Definitely.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.695
"Definitely him" What?

10:21.497 --> 10:23.158
For Landsunion.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.907
Evi's had her filthy
little eyes on you
for some time now...

10:27.002 --> 10:29.584
(SNARLS)
And... truth be told,
so have I.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.253
So, who do you prefer?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.916
What the hells
are they talking about?

10:36.011 --> 10:39.003
Oh, just the oldest
Qreshi custom there is.

10:40.182 --> 10:41.217
They're asking
which of them

10:41.308 --> 10:43.219
you would like
to marry, Jaqobis.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.555
TU RIN: Never thought
I’d ever say this,

10:49.650 --> 10:51.106
but I think
Gared was the smart one

10:51.193 --> 10:52.808
for getting out of Old Town
when he could.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.143
Oh, hush.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.815
We get Zeph any new info
on the weather,

10:55.906 --> 10:57.146
they blow up
the factory,

10:57.241 --> 10:58.822
and everything goes back
to normal.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.774
Everything goes back
to normal,

11:00.869 --> 11:02.985
I think I mightjust
stick with this whole
drug dealer thing.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.446
A lot less stressful
than running the RAC.

11:05.749 --> 11:06.784
Tell me about it.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.582
Well, that's certainly
something new.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.289
Yep, Gared was
the smart one.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.549
We should
get moving now.

11:19.263 --> 11:21.470
What kind of
weapon is this?

11:21.557 --> 11:24.424
It's not a weapon.
Though according
to Johnny,

11:24.518 --> 11:27.134
my pottery is a crime
against humanity.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.765
Look, |, uh...

11:32.067 --> 11:34.308
I need your help
with these Qreshis.

11:34.403 --> 11:37.270
Kendry says
if I reveal myself
too soon

11:37.364 --> 11:39.355
as the heir
to the Tenth Family,

11:39.449 --> 11:42.657
things on Qresh could get
a little stabby.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.578
I can tell you a secret.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.116
I know
what The Lady wants.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.326
Jaq's body.
We know that.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.252
No. No,
someone else.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.251
Someone who knows
Hullen physiology.

11:58.093 --> 12:01.256
And who has she spent
more time with
than any other human?

12:03.056 --> 12:04.171
Khlyen.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.052
That's why
she brought him back.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.351
To make sure the transfer
with Jaq holds.

12:09.438 --> 12:10.974
And once she has
the abilities...

12:11.064 --> 12:12.565
There's no way
of stopping her.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.352
That's why we have
to rescue Papa.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.525
I don't even know
whose side he's on anymore.

12:16.612 --> 12:19.274
Papa always fights
for his family,

12:20.157 --> 12:21.317
for his home.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.406
And we have
to do the same.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.029
Qresh was never my home.

12:30.292 --> 12:33.284
And after all this time,
how is it still yours?

12:33.378 --> 12:34.879
It's where l was born.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.007
The Kin Rits were
the first of the Ten.

12:41.637 --> 12:44.344
We chose
which families ruled,

12:45.641 --> 12:47.632
and which families served.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.725
And after
all this time,

12:52.064 --> 12:53.395
I'm ready for it.

12:54.316 --> 12:57.683
Ready to go home
and take
my rightful place.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.484
I think I know
how you can help.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.946
You can't
marry Jaqobis.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.944
He has no lands,
no titles.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.151
I'm not entirely sure
he can read.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.951
Seyah Kendry,
marriage isn't always

13:09.039 --> 13:11.701
just about lands
and titles.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.624
It can be
about loftier things.

13:14.753 --> 13:15.913
Like banging.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.916
Lots and lots...
(SLAPS)

13:18.006 --> 13:18.995
...of banging.

13:19.091 --> 13:21.707
Okay, as soon as
this evil bitch is
done with Westerley,

13:21.802 --> 13:23.212
she's gonna come
right for Qresh.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.168
And there won't be
any more banging.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.969
If she's such a threat,
why should we give you

13:27.057 --> 13:29.173
the things we might need
to defend ourselves?

13:31.353 --> 13:34.390
Because this is
about more than just
fighting for yourselves.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.223
This is about
taking a stand. This...

13:38.318 --> 13:41.936
And because ifyou give us
all the missiles and guns
you can spare,

13:42.155 --> 13:44.316
Delle Seyah Kendry
will make the Land Robbel

13:44.408 --> 13:45.568
a member of the Nine.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.241
She will?
Oh, no, she will not.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.444
Our mutual friend
has already agreed to it.

13:50.539 --> 13:51.528
Go and ask her.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.370
Fine.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.084
Give my friends
that which they require,
and l,

14:02.342 --> 14:04.674
Delle Seyah Kendry
of Land Kendry,

14:04.761 --> 14:07.138
will offer Land Robbel

14:07.222 --> 14:11.010
a seat at
the Council of Nine.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.395
Uh... Oh.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.726
I think my speech
might have worked.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.276
Absolutely.

14:21.737 --> 14:24.103
We get to the bar,
get this info to Zeph,

14:24.197 --> 14:25.653
and have a nice drink
orﬁve.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.231
Less talking,
more walking.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.532
(CREATURE SNARLS)
Did you hear that?

14:31.246 --> 14:33.111
Hey! Pree?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.238
Oh man, am I glad
to see you.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.079
This fog, it's like,
crazy, huh?

14:39.171 --> 14:41.787
Oh. It's me, Carl.

14:41.882 --> 14:42.917
Who?

14:43.258 --> 14:44.759
Hi, lwork with Gared.

14:44.926 --> 14:48.054
Come on, | play wompball
with you guys
every weekend.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.300
You stole my tablet.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.675
All right,
whatever.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.181
You can come back
with us to the bar.

14:53.268 --> 14:56.305
Great! Man, lfeel
a lot safer
with you guys than...

14:56.396 --> 14:58.102
(CREATURE SNARLS)
(CARL SCREAMS)

15:01.818 --> 15:02.807
Carl?

15:14.081 --> 15:15.412
Well, shit.

15:21.630 --> 15:24.087
Missiles are loaded.
We have to get back.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.373
You okay to go
with the Robbels?

15:26.468 --> 15:29.005
Well, they do give
good grovel.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.758
I'd forgotten how much
I missed that.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.008
Did, um...

15:34.726 --> 15:36.466
Did, um... Did Jaq say
anything about me?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.226
Like what?
I don't know.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.851
The last time I saw him,
I, I didn't even
know who he was.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.316
I guess I wouldn't
blame him if he...

15:45.070 --> 15:46.185
hated me.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.571
We are here because
he insisted we save you.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.612
So no,
he doesn't hate you.

15:53.703 --> 15:56.319
I don't think he cared much
for that cube we left him in,

15:56.414 --> 15:58.405
but that was
Aneela's idea.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.995
It's not like I could
ever change her mind.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.248
Yeah, I know
the feeling.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.250
Oh, Gods, Jaqobis,
take that hair shirt off.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.502
It's not a good look for you.
It's not that.

16:09.386 --> 16:10.375
lt's you.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.090
You seem different.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.591
It's been a long journey...

16:19.604 --> 16:22.562
but at the end,
there was Aneela.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.351
And when you've
got someone like that
to fight for...

16:30.448 --> 16:31.699
In any case...

16:34.202 --> 16:35.578
off to your war.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.318
You too.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.538
Good luck.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.658
I don't need
luck, Jaqobis.

16:43.253 --> 16:44.413
l have breeding...

16:45.964 --> 16:47.124
and knives.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.920
JOHN: Welcome to
the SS Ladyki/ler.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.422
l'm Johnny. I'll be
your cruise director.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.753
We have multiple cans
of whup-ass

16:54.848 --> 16:56.258
waiting for you
inthelounge.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.965
Well, we've got
the buckets of sunshines
ready for launching.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.345
Any luck with the
targeting system?

17:00.437 --> 17:02.974
Say hello to the
Missile Beaconator 5000.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.190
Patent pending.

17:04.274 --> 17:05.980
Plunk this puppy
by a control core,

17:06.067 --> 17:07.523
and missiles will
fly to it like Dutch

17:07.611 --> 17:09.727
to an emotionally
unavailable
father figure.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.520
Aah! Too soon?

17:11.698 --> 17:12.904
You can'tjust
go in there

17:12.991 --> 17:14.822
and say, "Hi,
where's your control core?"

17:14.910 --> 17:15.899
We need a diversion.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.359
We put together
a strike force,
20 people.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.443
We go in hard,
draw their fire.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.823
You sneak in
the back.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.576
We have volunteers...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.203
You have volunteers
for an
infiltration mission,

17:24.294 --> 17:25.875
which you said
would be quick
and quiet.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.294
This sounds like
a full-on assault,

17:28.381 --> 17:29.837
and that
means casualties.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.040
It's the only way.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.590
Well, then you make
your case to them.

17:32.928 --> 17:34.168
They'll make
their choice.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.422
DUTCH: |Wi||.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.345
So pep rally.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.048
We got missiles.
We got targets.
We got plans.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.760
ZEPH: Uh, Johnny,
we have a problem.

17:42.854 --> 17:45.687
And right on schedule.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.480
So far, the fog's
only over Old Town,

17:47.567 --> 17:50.434
but that extreme
locaHzaﬂon
can't be natural.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.905
And then the whole
monsters-eating-people thing.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.196
These creatures were
the size of a houseplant
last time we saw them.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.114
I guess The Lady's
wee creepy-crawlies

17:57.202 --> 17:58.362
turned into bigger,
hungry ones.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.034
That rapid growth rate
is concerning.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.782
Yeah, missiles can wait.
We have to get down there.

18:01.873 --> 18:02.908
No.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.039
We hit
the factories first,

18:05.126 --> 18:06.536
and then
we save Old Town.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.290
Dutch, the factories
aren't the ones
eating people.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.542
Look, right now,
the cloud is
over Old Town.

18:11.633 --> 18:12.873
There are
over 200 factories.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.424
lfthis is
just a test run...

18:14.511 --> 18:17.002
Then we're up to
our asses in aliens
before we can stop her.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.883
We have friends
down there.
They have families.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.010
They're just gonna
have to hold on
until we can get them.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.846
LUCY: Dutch, a Black Root ship
is approaching the Herks.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.552
We're cloaked.
How did they find us?

18:25.647 --> 18:27.638
LUCY: It’s hailing
with an SOS.

18:27.732 --> 18:32.146
GARED: Guys? Johnny,
shouldn’t there be
a ship around here?

18:32.904 --> 18:34.235
Is that Gared?

18:34.322 --> 18:35.858
GARED: Yeah.
I’ve come to help.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.694
Yeah, forgot to mention.

18:42.372 --> 18:45.034
TU RlN: Make yourself at home.
Drinks on the house.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.370
So what exactly
do you mean
by, "Hold on," Zeph?

18:48.461 --> 18:50.577
ZEPH: Send me
the info you got
from my weather station,

18:50.672 --> 18:53.254
and I'll figure out a way
to bioengineer the fog

18:53.341 --> 18:55.798
to repel those...
things.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.251
You really think
you can do this, Zeph,

18:58.346 --> 19:01.008
or is this just some shit
you're saying
to keep us calm?

19:02.017 --> 19:03.678
Maybe.
Is it working?

19:05.603 --> 19:07.434
Come on. Ginny?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.057
Pree, I haven't
been home in days.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.184
I got things
to do, man.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.061
And I don't want anybody
out there right now.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.600
Besides...

19:13.695 --> 19:16.528
(GRUNTS)
...this little one
could use a friend.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.778
Hey, sweetie.

19:21.411 --> 19:23.447
I grabbed
whoever I could
off the streets.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.699
Most folks got out of town
when they saw the fog.

19:25.790 --> 19:26.950
You tell 'em why?

19:27.042 --> 19:30.159
Nah. No point
scaring them
more than we have to.

19:32.255 --> 19:33.540
You talk to Zeph?

19:33.631 --> 19:35.667
Oh, yeah,
she has a plan.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.082
Thatbad,huh?

19:37.260 --> 19:40.002
Team Awesome Force
has been
pissing me off and...

19:40.388 --> 19:42.879
saving our asses
longer than
I care to recall.

19:44.309 --> 19:47.301
If anyone can
sort this shit out,
Yardeen can.

19:48.646 --> 19:52.355
Well, we had
a plan, but...

19:53.109 --> 19:56.101
like my old friend
Big Joe used to say,

19:56.488 --> 19:58.979
"Plans are for shit.
What else you got?"

19:59.824 --> 20:03.032
I say we go for
a full frontal attack,

20:03.119 --> 20:04.575
hitting them hard

20:04.662 --> 20:07.790
and not stopping until
we win or die trying.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.576
Are you in?

20:12.796 --> 20:14.332
D'AVlN: They're not
buying it.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.879
Okay, I'm gonna
cut the bullshit, um...

20:20.845 --> 20:22.881
This isn't what
you volunteered for.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.631
Hells, this isn't
even your fight.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.720
But it could be,

20:30.021 --> 20:31.557
if you choose it.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.473
Like many of you,

20:34.984 --> 20:38.147
l have spent my life
apart from family,

20:38.488 --> 20:39.568
politics,

20:40.782 --> 20:41.988
all that other bullshit.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.741
That's why
I became a Killjoy.

20:46.996 --> 20:51.239
But today,
lam part of something.

20:51.793 --> 20:56.457
I am fighting
a darkness that is
threatening Old Town,

20:56.548 --> 20:57.913
the Quad, our home.

20:59.884 --> 21:03.718
And lwon't stop fighting
until this darkness is gone

21:03.805 --> 21:05.341
orlam.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.516
But ifwe win...

21:12.105 --> 21:13.470
lfwe win...

21:16.276 --> 21:18.187
the Quad will
need protectors.

21:20.155 --> 21:22.111
And lwould be honored

21:24.075 --> 21:28.239
to stand alongside
anybody who
joins this fight today.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.947
I would
call them family.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.076
So who's with me?

21:52.896 --> 21:55.137
Let's go see a bitch
about a bombing.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.106
(EXHALES)

22:07.744 --> 22:09.109
(LAUGHS)

22:09.704 --> 22:11.410
You have to
hold still.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.489
Okay, again.
For real this time.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.415
(LAUGHS)

22:16.669 --> 22:18.455
I can't help it.
It tickles!

22:23.009 --> 22:24.874
Wait, what if
they scan me?

22:24.969 --> 22:27.005
I built this
earpiece myself.

22:28.056 --> 22:30.763
Chromium plating,
subatomic transistors.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.636
lt's undetectable,
untraceable,

22:32.727 --> 22:35.139
and will let you
hearJohnny
wherever he is.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.016
Okay, but...

22:38.691 --> 22:39.976
can Johnny
hear my thoughts?

22:40.068 --> 22:41.274
It's not...

22:42.237 --> 22:43.602
You'll be
fine, Gared.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.357
Do you need me
to explain it again?

22:48.451 --> 22:50.237
Do you think
they'll ever forgive me?

22:51.287 --> 22:53.949
After what I did?

22:54.207 --> 22:56.038
They're trusting you
to pull this off.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.535
Isn't that your answer?

23:00.213 --> 23:02.955
Maybe the question
isn't if they forgive you,

23:03.258 --> 23:05.249
but whether
you forgive yourself.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.050
I turned against
the people
I cared about, too.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.426
It takes time.

23:14.644 --> 23:15.759

23:16.354 --> 23:17.969
You care about people.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.142

23:21.943 --> 23:23.274
Good luck, Gared.

(FANCY GROANS)

23:27.907 --> 23:29.647
I should never have
said anything.

23:31.661 --> 23:32.867
You really think
this is gonna work?

23:32.954 --> 23:35.366
You heard what he said.
As long as
Khlyen still trusts him.

23:35.456 --> 23:37.037
Yeah, but, you know...

23:37.417 --> 23:38.406
it's Gared.

23:40.628 --> 23:41.913

this isn't gonna work...

No, no, it's not that.
ljust...

23:46.634 --> 23:49.341
I just, I wanted
to say that

if anything happens,
I, uh...

On our way, Johnny.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.136

Oh, Watch that barrel
there, mister.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.853
ZEPH:
Johnny, lneed you
to see something.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.654
I pulled these scans
from my weather station

24:10.742 --> 24:12.778
and isolated
the fog elements.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.322
JOHN: Lucy, can you pull up
Zeph's scans?

24:15.747 --> 24:17.203
ZEPH: What do these
look like to you?

24:17.874 --> 24:19.239
Holy shit.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.325
That's definitely a virus.
You have to tell Old Town.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.705
That what I thought at first,
but look closer.

24:25.006 --> 24:26.121
lt's attenuated.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.876
And what kind of virus
is attenuated, Johnny?

24:27.967 --> 24:30.583
Remember when I said that
you had that tone sometimes

24:30.678 --> 24:31.963
that made me
want to punch babies?

24:32.055 --> 24:33.340
That’s the one.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.259
An attenuated virus
is a vaccine.

24:35.350 --> 24:36.556
Exactly.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.850
I don't think this fog was
supposed to poison anybody,

24:38.936 --> 24:40.642
it was supposed to
immunize them.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.220
Yeah, but against what?

24:44.067 --> 24:45.682
(PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

my sights squared.

are backwards
like they are.

rock and roll.

what were you gonna
tell me earlier on?

a distraction

25:56.848 --> 25:59.009

on this ship here.

How exactly are they
going to attack

fire them at you.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.058
What are we supposed to do?

31:33.142 --> 31:35.053
You remember
where the hells
you're from.

31:35.144 --> 31:36.600
TURIN: These people
ain't woke, Pree.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.435
They don't even know
who they are.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.103
Is that man
on drugs?

31:40.274 --> 31:41.514
Probably, sweetie.

31:41.609 --> 31:43.270
But what the hell is he
talking about, Pree?

31:47.323 --> 31:49.484
None of you are
who you think you are.

31:49.992 --> 31:52.153
Oh, hells, lthought
l was a Killjoy.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.819
Not that I wasn't
fabulous at it,

31:55.331 --> 31:57.037
but I'm a bartender.

31:57.208 --> 31:58.573
That's who lam.

31:58.876 --> 32:01.583
And when I look at you all,
you know what I see?

32:02.004 --> 32:04.336
People who have
been through
the Black Rain,

32:04.507 --> 32:06.168
and Company bombings,

32:06.717 --> 32:08.253
Spring Hill wall.

32:09.053 --> 32:10.884
Because you're Old Town,

32:10.971 --> 32:12.711
the lowest of the low,

32:12.807 --> 32:14.672
and damn proud of it.

32:14.767 --> 32:17.133
You never give up
and you never give in,

32:17.228 --> 32:19.469
no matter
who you think you are.

32:20.147 --> 32:25.107
And now we are going
to sit here
and not be afraid.

32:25.194 --> 32:26.434
And sing some songs?

32:26.654 --> 32:30.112
Yes, baby,
and sing some songs.

32:31.534 --> 32:33.820
(SINGING) A girl from Leith

32:34.328 --> 32:36.694
With skin like snow

32:37.123 --> 32:39.409
What brought me here

32:39.750 --> 32:41.957
She’d like to know

32:42.545 --> 32:47.209
Was it the job,
the Company gin

32:47.716 --> 32:53.336
She ain’t never met
a real Wester/yn

32:53.430 --> 32:55.682
Oh, Westerley

32:55.766 --> 32:58.178
I’m Wester/yn

32:58.477 --> 33:00.308
Oh, Westerley

33:00.437 --> 33:02.769
I’ll say it again

33:02.857 --> 33:05.189
Screw ’em all

33:05.276 --> 33:07.642
They’ll never ken

33:07.945 --> 33:10.607

33:35.890 --> 33:37.005
Wow

33:37.975 --> 33:40.091
Ah, oh

33:44.023 --> 33:45.513
You know, these are
the moments that I miss.

33:45.608 --> 33:47.564
You, me,
a bunch of dead assholes.

33:49.987 --> 33:52.319
D'AVl N:
Holding them off.
Status update?

33:52.615 --> 33:53.730
(BEEPS)

33:54.575 --> 33:55.815
Are we good?

33:55.910 --> 33:57.150
Golden.

33:57.286 --> 33:59.197
D'av, package delivered.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.028
Meet you
at the rendezvous.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.577
Fall back! Fall back!

34:04.668 --> 34:06.078
MAN : Back it up!
WOMAN: Go! Move it!

34:06.170 --> 34:07.660
D'AVlN: Tell Rennika
to hold on
until we ’re in the clear.

34:07.755 --> 34:10.542
No problem. We're almost
home-free, kiddies.

34:23.270 --> 34:24.430
That's my girl.

34:37.993 --> 34:38.982
(SlGHS)

34:43.958 --> 34:45.243
Sorry, Yala.

34:47.461 --> 34:48.621
DUTCH: So am I.

34:50.881 --> 34:52.041
Yala.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.542
I wanted to see
what you'd do on your own,

34:53.634 --> 34:55.420
what side
you're really on.

34:56.178 --> 34:57.588
And now I know.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.841
You need to come with me.
This plan of yours
won't work.

34:59.974 --> 35:02.215
Actually, I think
it worked out pretty well.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.219
You sent Gared,
knew I'd find the bug,

35:07.314 --> 35:09.521
hear your voice,
and come right to you.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.394
Everyone has a weakness,

35:11.485 --> 35:13.646
especially if it's
someone they love.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.652
Now you're
coming with us.

35:15.864 --> 35:17.729
No. You can't do this.

35:17.825 --> 35:19.736
Oh, I'm pretty sure
we can.

35:19.827 --> 35:20.907
Johnny?

35:21.203 --> 35:22.534
We got you...

35:25.499 --> 35:26.909
and we've got
another beacon.

35:27.001 --> 35:28.741
And some big-ass missiles.

35:28.836 --> 35:31.623
Why am I not surprised
that you of all people

35:31.714 --> 35:33.500
would mistake
the size of your missiles

35:33.590 --> 35:34.921
for the power you have?

35:36.510 --> 35:38.626
Did Khlyen just make
a dickjoke?

35:38.721 --> 35:41.007
If you destroy the factory,
The Lady will
destroy the Quad,

35:41.098 --> 35:42.213
and for what?

35:42.308 --> 35:43.673
Her children are
already in Old Town.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.428
I burned them down once.
I can do it again

35:45.519 --> 35:46.679
once the fog is gone.

35:46.770 --> 35:49.557
That fog is the final
treatment for
the fully grown alien form,

35:49.648 --> 35:51.604
and once it's gone,
they will be indestructible.

35:51.692 --> 35:54.308
I thought the vaccine
was to inoculate
the people of Old Town,

35:54.403 --> 35:55.609
but if it's
for the hatchlings...

35:55.696 --> 35:57.436
People of Old Town
don't matter anymore,

35:57.531 --> 35:58.771
except as food.

35:58.866 --> 35:59.855
That's not happening.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.190
It already has.

36:01.577 --> 36:03.363
We can't win this war.

36:03.454 --> 36:05.069
But if I can
keep Qresh safe...

36:05.164 --> 36:06.995
No, lam fighting
for Westerley.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.073
Yala, you can't fight
for something

36:09.168 --> 36:11.409
unless you know what
you're willing to lose.

36:13.672 --> 36:14.878
Now, I have a plan.

36:18.594 --> 36:19.879
So do I.

36:21.388 --> 36:24.596
Johnny, how wide
are the target zones
for the missiles?

36:24.683 --> 36:26.219
Well, a few kilometers,
but I thought
we just needed

36:26.310 --> 36:27.641
to take out the factory,
don't we?

36:27.728 --> 36:30.561
Yeah, well,
he said Old Town is
full of those bugs.

36:30.731 --> 36:32.016
lfwe don't stop it now...

36:32.107 --> 36:33.096
We never will.

36:34.777 --> 36:36.233
l'll reset the target zone.

36:38.655 --> 36:39.986
Someone needs
to tell Pree.

36:40.074 --> 36:41.655
Lucy, prep your engines.
We're coming in.

36:41.742 --> 36:43.323
LUCY: Preparing for evac.

36:43.911 --> 36:45.993
All right, everybody,
stay close.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.241

Jump pods will be waiting
for us in the Badlands.

36:52.419 --> 36:54.250
We just have
to get there.

36:54.338 --> 36:56.499
It's just a game, sweetie.
Just like hide-and-seek.

36:56.590 --> 36:58.876
Why isn't
anybody smiling?

36:59.426 --> 37:01.007
Everyone needs
to stick together,

37:01.095 --> 37:02.676
but when I say run,
you run.

37:02.971 --> 37:03.960
Aah!

37:04.056 --> 37:05.216

is in the Badlands.

37:20.531 --> 37:21.737
It’s now or never.

JOHN: Are you sure
you want to do this?

no other way.

have time for this.

38:21.675 --> 38:22.755
Found you.

38:22.843 --> 38:24.925
I don't want you to.
Aneela.

38:25.012 --> 38:26.593
And I don't want
to go to Arkyn.

38:30.934 --> 38:34.222
We don't always get to do
the things we want, my love.

38:39.026 --> 38:40.982
And what we're
doing on Arkyn,

38:41.069 --> 38:42.605
that's for all of Qresh.

38:42.696 --> 38:44.982
And I promise you,
once we're done there,

38:45.532 --> 38:47.033
we will come home again.

38:56.043 --> 38:57.203

Hey.

did you, Mommy?

a little while.

okay now.

Well, Yala, that was
quite the show.

if it wasn't?

understand what
