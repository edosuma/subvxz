WEBVTT

00:26.526 --> 00:27.760
- Why?

00:27.762 --> 00:29.495
- So we can
have a record of it,

00:29.497 --> 00:30.796
so we can show papi.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.399
It helps him to remember.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.034
Now, are you ready?

00:35.702 --> 00:38.337
Like we practiced, okay?

00:38.339 --> 00:40.139
- Like that?

00:40.141 --> 00:43.409
- Si, exactly like that.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.210
Now don't stop, okay, Annie?

01:43.169 --> 01:45.671
- This should be take 11.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.673
This Ana Carter, U.S. citizen,

01:47.675 --> 01:50.542
documenting proof
for my student visa.

01:50.544 --> 01:53.779
Phd chemical engineering
at Oxford university.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.315
Currently testing electrolyte
for batteries exposed

01:56.317 --> 01:59.384
to varying
electromagnetic pulse.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.553
7.13, electromagnetic
pulse managed

02:01.555 --> 02:03.755
by algorithm 13, running 13.

02:06.593 --> 02:09.895
Hypothesis correct, atom again
unaffected by varying pulse.

02:09.897 --> 02:13.165
Electrolyte stable,
7.13 successful.

02:16.536 --> 02:20.772
Test 7.14, electromagnetic
pulse managed by algorithm 14.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.876
And we're running 14.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.546
Okay, hypothesis correct.

02:27.548 --> 02:31.617
Atom unaffected by varying
pulse, electrolyte stable.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.818
7.14 successful.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.823
Test 7 and 15.

02:38.791 --> 02:41.360
Pulse managed by algorithm 15.

02:42.695 --> 02:43.762
Running 15.

02:54.574 --> 02:57.342
Hypothesis correct, atom
unaffected by varying pulse.

02:57.344 --> 03:01.380
Electrolyte stable,
7.15 successful.

03:04.551 --> 03:07.452
Test 7.16, electromagnetic
pulse managed

03:07.454 --> 03:09.521
by digital algorithm 16.

03:12.325 --> 03:13.692
Running 16.

03:20.833 --> 03:24.336
Hypothesis correct, atom
unaffected by varying pulse.

03:24.338 --> 03:27.239
Electrolyte stable,
16 successful.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.617
Test 7.17, pulse managed
by digital algorithm 17.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.223
Running 17.

03:55.836 --> 03:56.935
Whoa.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.707
What?

04:08.882 --> 04:11.717
- Hey, I'm gonna take my
undergrads for a beer.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.652
Do you want to come?

04:14.621 --> 04:16.755
- Yep, it happened again.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.290
Disappeared.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.392
It doesn't make sense.
- Coffee?

04:20.394 --> 04:21.560
I brought some good stuff.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.795
- Six times now,
it's always the same.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.364
- So?

04:25.366 --> 04:27.266
- So, it's not a mistake.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.967
We're making this happen.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.435
- Deconstruct.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.870
An atom disappeared.
- Just an electron.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.406
- Disappeared, so deconstruct.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.541
An electron can't just vanish.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.678
- Theoretically, if it's
destroyed, or moved,
or hiding, it can.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.879
- We haven't destroyed anything.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.614
If you had you
would wiped out...

04:42.616 --> 04:45.951
Okay, so you removed
it or it's hidden.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.787
- But carbon wouldn't have
bonded if the electron

04:48.789 --> 04:52.457
was just hiding.
- So you removed it.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.525
Okay.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.561
I've just never seen it
done like that before.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.697
Where's it going and how?

05:00.934 --> 05:05.070
- The calculations
are proportional to
the subject volume.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.872
For an atom this should be fine.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.808
- Where did you get it?
The algorithm, I mean.

05:09.810 --> 05:14.713
I was trying to show variance
in pulse had no effect
on the electrolyte.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.515
- Wait, but hang on a sec.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.883
Where's this one from?
- Test 17

05:17.885 --> 05:20.052
to effect an entire atom.

05:23.022 --> 05:24.456
No hypothesis.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.027
No hypothesis, running 17.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.840
- We're gonna need
a bigger boat.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.455
Okay, so these I recognize
from my undergrad days.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.590
This is just secondary
school geometry.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.926
But 17, it's quantum theory.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.463
Except you've dicked
around with it.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.897
Why have you got pi in there?

06:05.899 --> 06:07.899
- I needed an endless
string, non-repeating.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.768
- Yeah, but you
can't use pi this way.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.002
It doesn't make sense.

06:11.004 --> 06:14.740
- You're gonna
crash the server.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.907
- We need help.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.509
A molecule is
something I can trace,

06:17.511 --> 06:21.646
but we need help recoding
so we use less power.

06:21.648 --> 06:24.649
- If you're talking
about that...

06:24.651 --> 06:26.017
- Can you ask her?

06:27.019 --> 06:29.087
- Fuck no, she's like...

06:30.556 --> 06:31.790
Seriously, no.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.860
- Distributive computing, mostly
it's charities that use it.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.129
You sign your computer up to
kill cancer in its spare time,

06:37.131 --> 06:39.765
your processor crunches
numbers whilst you sleep.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.166
This place runs a couple.
- Really?

06:41.168 --> 06:42.534
- Really.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.869
- Can we use them?

06:43.871 --> 06:45.937
- You've cut your hair, Nathan.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.540
Sure, you register your
project, give it a year,

06:48.542 --> 06:50.108
hope a dozen people log on.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.610
I like it.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.479
You look a little less faggy.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.047
- Distributive computing--
- needs volunteers.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.916
- We need a lot.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.985
How many?
- Our test crashed the server.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.887
- I heard, well done!

07:01.889 --> 07:03.755
You hackers, you.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.992
- We need processing on
the petaflop's range.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.828
- What are you
doing up there?
- And this could pull that?

07:09.830 --> 07:11.797
- It's not legal,
it won't happen like that.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.632
- But it is possible?

07:13.634 --> 07:15.934
- Tapping the school's easy,
we're inside the firewall.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.170
Likewise, a worm that will
sign people up to the grid

07:18.172 --> 07:20.705
without their knowledge,
piece of piss.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.041
But how the worm spreads.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.444
or you could have
half the planet

07:25.446 --> 07:28.113
donating spare
capacity by Tuesday.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.449
- That would be nice.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.516
- Here.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.586
- Hello.
- Vivisection is murder.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.121
- Okay, scrufter.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.723
- And you can do this?
- Sure.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.659
Tell me what you're doing.

07:40.661 --> 07:41.726
I want in.

07:45.064 --> 07:47.933
- Ana, what she's
suggesting is illegal.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.168
Hacking, stealing servers.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.109
Okay, let's do it.

07:59.078 --> 08:00.946
- And their packing,
it's all--
- it'll be fine.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.482
It's just, it makes me sad.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.819
Something nice?

08:40.821 --> 08:45.023
- Si, actually it's grilled
chicken wrapped in parma ham

08:45.025 --> 08:47.926
stuffed with
mozzarella and basil.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.029
Si, I know.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.268
I know.

08:56.270 --> 08:58.303
- Nathan, you're
such a goddamn wet.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.005
It's utterly untraceable.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.107
It just worms along from email
address book to address book

09:02.109 --> 09:05.143
feeding us power, and it's
growing exponentially.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.313
I'm monitoring Norton, mcafee,
but so far we're clean.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.849
God, this fucker's heavy.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.584
- Come watch.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.621
Three, two, one.

09:19.258 --> 09:20.725
- Okay.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.093
Technically, we're not
moving stuff, are we?

09:22.095 --> 09:24.029
Moving involves locomotion.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.665
We know we're not destroying.
- Or deconstituting.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.067
There's no residue, no
trace of the particle.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.036
- It means we're
sending it somewhere.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.171
- Yeah, but where?

09:33.173 --> 09:36.841
we're creating a frame.
- And we have marble 42.

09:36.843 --> 09:37.976
- Again, i
see what we're doing.

09:37.978 --> 09:42.747
And these variables, Ana,
this part of the equation?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.683
- And goodbye, marble.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.152
Oh, yeah, feedback from
the electrodes, current.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.020
I had to account for it.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.156
- So a number comes back in fed

09:51.158 --> 09:52.591
into the equation from outside?

09:52.593 --> 09:54.225
- An electric
oscillation, yes.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.927
- So, those are the electrodes?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.862
- And marble 44.
- An end can be--

09:57.864 --> 09:59.064
- negative.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.098
And your electrodes,
they were right angles.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.933
- Adios, marble 44.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.302
Yeah, so?

10:04.304 --> 10:06.304
- Your electrodes
create three axes.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.973
- In three dimensions.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.207
I never noticed before because
you have them pointing up.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.743
- But instead of like this,

10:12.378 --> 10:14.279
you define them like this.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.381
- Giving you an x,
y, and a z axis.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.217
- Up and down, forward
and back, left and right.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.820
- we could mark
a point anywhere.

10:21.822 --> 10:26.658
- Using the dimensions of the
subjects to define the unit.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.628
- Test 17.108 to
control the out node.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.229
Running diagnostics.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.897
So, if we wanted to send--

10:32.899 --> 10:35.233
- can we settle on something
with a touch of panache?

10:35.235 --> 10:37.202
Phase, teleport, zap?

10:37.204 --> 10:38.937
You lack imagination.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.673
- Okay, we want
to phase it here.

10:41.675 --> 10:42.941
- What's that?

10:42.943 --> 10:45.243
40 centimeters on
the positive x axis?

10:45.245 --> 10:47.145
- Yeah, put a little
into the y, negative,

10:47.147 --> 10:49.214
so that we can see that
these things will work.

10:49.216 --> 10:52.083
- So x is 40, call
it eight units.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.886
Negative one y,
negative two on the z.

10:54.888 --> 10:58.223
Hypothesis has the
subject moving, phasing,

10:58.225 --> 11:00.659
to a location 40
centimeters away.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.293
- And landing with a bump.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.428
- And landing with a bump.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.929
Running 17.108.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.986
- Whoa.
- Are you fucking joking?

11:27.988 --> 11:29.320
Oh, my god, we did it.
- Not yet.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.089
We still have a range
more test to run,

11:31.091 --> 11:33.258
but you know what we've done.
- Funding.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.093
Funding, funding,
we need to raise--

11:35.095 --> 11:36.194
- the worm is giving
us the capacity.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.363
- Everything will change.

11:40.232 --> 11:41.366
- Everything.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.134
Look at the
implications, just think.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.402
- Look, my uncle is a fund
manager, I could call him.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.071
- Everything,
i mean, the obvious.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.272
- Can we make it stable?

11:47.274 --> 11:49.307
- Not subject to
flying, but intrinsic?

11:49.309 --> 11:51.309
- It wouldn't stay open.
- Permanently, no.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.777
The processor
wouldn't handle it.

11:52.779 --> 11:53.945
- You're saying
to create a space?

11:53.947 --> 11:55.246
- A sphere.
- It would be a sphere,

11:55.248 --> 11:56.781
there's no other way.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.349
- Everything will change,
start with the obvious.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.784
- With a predetermined out node.

11:59.786 --> 12:02.253
- It's wormhole theory, we've...

12:02.255 --> 12:04.823
- Built a wormhole.

12:04.825 --> 12:05.890
A wormhole.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.359
We're teleporting shit?

12:08.361 --> 12:11.496
People, we're going to be gods.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.031
GPS will be up tomorrow.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.266
- Dad, can
you call Lawrence?

12:15.268 --> 12:16.968
We need solicitors.
- Start with the obvious.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.269
Patents, patents, copyrights.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.238
- We need experts, yes.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.473
But we need them soon.

12:21.475 --> 12:23.174
And uncle Scott, tell
them we'll have a demo.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.509
- In a month?
- In a week?

12:24.511 --> 12:26.411
- On Friday.
Look, dad, I've got to go.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.113
But what this is, is big.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.347
- So medicine.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.082
Tumors out of the
brain like that.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.417
Think how agriculture
will change.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.153
From a wormhole on a farm,
zap, into your fridge.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.921
The way we feed the
world will change.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.290
Wormholes in the floodplains
of Bangladesh and the Sahara

12:39.292 --> 12:44.062
- If this works and it doesn't
collapse all of reality.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.463
- We open wormholes
to the earth's core,

12:45.465 --> 12:47.265
tap geothermal energy,

12:47.267 --> 12:50.335
run cables through wormholes
to solar panels near the sun.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.270
- We'll need to check
for cellular mutation

12:52.272 --> 12:53.371
or molecular decay.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.306
- We also need to
discuss structure.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.475
We need to set up a
company, we need finance.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.011
- Minerals, we can pull
minerals from anywhere,

13:00.013 --> 13:01.846
send products everywhere.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.414
- Liv, where's this one going?

13:03.416 --> 13:06.384
- Gods, we're gonna
change the world.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.872
Hello, ferny.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.542
Oh my god!
Oh my god!

13:31.545 --> 13:32.977
Aw, your face.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.415
- What, what did I do?

13:43.255 --> 13:44.322
- Thank you.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.895
- You're
chewing a toothpick.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.130
- It's what cool guys do.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.464
- Oh, so you're a cool guy now?

13:53.466 --> 13:55.433
- Yeah, I am, actually.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.404
- Wanna see a magic trick?

13:59.406 --> 14:00.471
- Yeah.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.409
- I can make matter disappear.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.246
- Oh, can you now?
- Mhmm.

14:09.048 --> 14:10.114
You ready?

14:10.583 --> 14:11.850
Alright.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.055
You watching?

14:17.057 --> 14:18.356
- Yeah.
- Good.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.429
Ah,

14:24.431 --> 14:26.497
okay.
One more time, okay?

14:26.499 --> 14:28.066
Good.
- I'm watching you.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.133
- I know.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.372
Shit!

14:34.374 --> 14:37.342
- I think you should
probably stick to the piano.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.943
- Oh, thank you.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.086
Ha!

14:49.021 --> 14:50.922
- Very good.
- I know.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.525
- But where did it go?

14:56.362 --> 14:58.296
Up your sleeve.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.364
- Really?

15:03.369 --> 15:06.371
- You messed up the first two
times on purpose, didn't you?

15:06.373 --> 15:08.539
So the third time i
wasn't paying attention

15:08.541 --> 15:13.011
and you picked it up
with your other hand.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.078
Show me.

15:15.514 --> 15:16.581
Show me!

15:18.450 --> 15:20.218
Yes, I'm a genius.

15:33.365 --> 15:37.001
Six years since we were
undergrads together.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.437
- Second year physics.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.505
- Long time.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.208
- It is.

15:51.550 --> 15:52.650
Nate?

16:03.629 --> 16:05.029
Tests are perfect.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.497
DNA, rna identical.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.534
Hey!

16:10.302 --> 16:11.536
Looking good.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.338
- Yeah, I warned you
i was a cool guy.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.574
Come see, Liv's created
a stable sphere.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.210
- It's only 30
centimeters across.

16:19.212 --> 16:22.580
We can't process
anything bigger, not yet.

16:39.631 --> 16:41.366
Tempting, right?

16:41.368 --> 16:43.267
- It's so interesting.

16:44.403 --> 16:45.470
It doesn't look like
i thought it would.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.572
- No, it's doing...

16:47.574 --> 16:48.740
You can see the numbers there.

16:48.742 --> 16:52.510
It's doing things
with light that...

16:52.512 --> 16:54.645
Anyway, stand over there.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.486
Yeah.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.759
Phase attack!
Get in.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.627
- That is something, though.

17:09.629 --> 17:10.762
There's potential for it.

17:10.764 --> 17:12.563
- No one will attack
anyone, hippie.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.598
Retaliation would be too easy.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.466
- Like the atom bomb?
- Bingo.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.801
Think how this will
affect transport.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.403
- If we can phase live fauna.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.671
- Think.
Cities will change.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.074
People will live in the
country, phase into the office.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.642
- All the social
problems cities bring--

17:24.644 --> 17:26.611
- will change.
Travel will change.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.046
Phase to the mountains.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.381
- Phase to the beaches,
to mom for tea.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.616
- To the moon.

17:32.618 --> 17:35.420
To the vault of
a bank, anywhere.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.221
- Now you're talking.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.289
Nathan.

17:48.768 --> 17:49.834
Such wit.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.340
We're moving fast here.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.675
You think we should--
- no.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.077
No, we need to get a test in

17:59.079 --> 18:01.379
before the university
get involved.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.082
Buying all the hardware
to run this legally

18:04.084 --> 18:06.150
means serious product first.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.685
- Okay, stinky thing.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.388
Prepare to make history.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.395
Granny?

18:17.397 --> 18:19.464
Hello, granny, it's Liv.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.566
Olivia.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.567
Yes.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.635
Question, how's tinkles?

18:27.340 --> 18:28.439
- Yeah, the patents.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.607
I need them processed.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.842
I needed them
processed yesterday

18:30.844 --> 18:34.579
and I need them done
in Ana's name, okay?

18:34.581 --> 18:37.148
All of them, they're all
gonna want to see this.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.616
I mean, dad, this is massive.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.119
- Your
grandmother's cat, really?

18:41.121 --> 18:43.554
- Fuck, oh my god!
- Way bigger.

18:44.556 --> 18:47.825
Dad, it's like
inventing electricity.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.660
- It's sound science.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.363
Granny will spot anything odd.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.599
Nate, can you give
us a hand here?

18:54.601 --> 18:56.400
- It's all possible, isn't it?

18:56.402 --> 18:57.802
- This is the
single biggest thing

18:57.804 --> 18:59.537
that mankind--
- little boy a hand.

18:59.539 --> 19:04.609
- Red suits you, and
this thing with the hair?

19:04.611 --> 19:07.345
No, really, I like it, honest.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.748
It's not so dragon tattoo,
hacker stock image.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.750
- It's a good move.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.751
Incognito.

19:17.623 --> 19:18.656
- Olivia, darling.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.691
Come in, come in!

19:20.693 --> 19:21.893
Oh, it's cold out there.

19:21.895 --> 19:24.595
Oh, come in, come on through.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.599
Well you look lovely.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.868
You've taken that horrible
blue shit out of your hair.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.937
Are you, um, here
for tinkles again?

19:32.939 --> 19:34.705
- Hello to you too, granny.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.908
We just wanted to see
how he's doing, actually.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.709
- Well, he's doing wonderfully.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.745
Hello there, I'm Brenda.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.914
I'm Olivia's
grandmother, and you are?

19:42.916 --> 19:44.715
- I'm Ana, hi.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.551
This is Nathan.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.685
- I'm Nathan.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.753
- They're my assistants.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.288
Although Ana is an immigrant,

19:50.290 --> 19:52.657
so feel free to
call border patrol.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.259
- You're not being
suspicious at all.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.527
Any reason why he wouldn't be?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.729
- Oh, he fractured the
space time continuum,

19:58.731 --> 20:01.399
visited the fourth dimension.
- Did he now?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.901
Would you like some tea?

20:09.741 --> 20:10.875
- This place is nuts.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.410
- Tell me about it.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.712
I knew she came from
money, but this?

20:14.714 --> 20:15.846
- You're looking
quite smart, actually?

20:15.848 --> 20:16.847
- Well, you know what?

20:16.849 --> 20:18.583
I'm channeling my inner granny.

20:18.585 --> 20:21.652
- Yeah, I her grandfather
is Earl somebody.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.521
11th in line for the throne.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.589
- Seriously?

20:26.491 --> 20:27.558
Check this.

20:30.762 --> 20:31.829
- Ana?

20:33.398 --> 20:34.465
- What's up?

20:35.767 --> 20:38.536
- Do you want to go
see a movie tonight?

20:38.538 --> 20:39.737
- Sure.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.540
We could all use
the break, right?

20:42.542 --> 20:45.977
- I mean like, go see
a movie, see a movie.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.782
- What are you...?

20:51.784 --> 20:55.686
- Fuck, forsaken
cock fuckers, fuck!

20:56.688 --> 20:58.556
- Good grief, Olivia.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.857
- I cannot fucking believe this.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.425
Can you fucking believe this?

21:01.427 --> 21:02.893
- I cannot fucking believe it.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.396
- I can't fucking
believe it, either.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.897
More tea?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.733
- Microsoft have a patch out.

21:08.735 --> 21:09.800
- A patch?

21:10.702 --> 21:12.837
- They're shutting
the worm down.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.572
- Okay, so what
does that give us?

21:14.574 --> 21:15.873
- A day Max.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.776
- The meeting is on
Friday, the demo.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.512
We'll get funding then.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.547
- Not enough to pull
cycles on this scale.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.715
- So?

21:24.717 --> 21:28.019
- We need to do a final
test, a knock out.

21:30.922 --> 21:32.757
- You're not suggesting...

21:32.759 --> 21:34.525
- She is.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.926
We need to be true
revolutionaries right
out of the gate.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.028
- She's right.

21:37.030 --> 21:38.596
To guarantee investment
on this scale,

21:38.598 --> 21:39.830
we'll need to have--
- and we'd need to do it now.

21:39.832 --> 21:40.931
Right now.

21:45.704 --> 21:47.772
- Okay, I'll do it.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.473
- Uh.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.877
The world doesn't work like
that anymore, Lancelot.

22:03.789 --> 22:04.889
- Well.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.391
- Well, then.

22:09.861 --> 22:11.796
- All systems operational.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.931
Temperature's dropping, holding.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.333
- Hydraulics one, up.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.335
Hydraulics two, up.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.904
Hydraulics three,
Liv, higher, higher.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.505
Up.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.107
- Diagnostics
reading okay.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.076
Still waiting for the
numbers to plateau.

22:25.078 --> 22:26.944
- .272, .99.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.448
Liv, the readings here,
they're inconsistent.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.849
Cable one's overheating.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.384
Switch to two and three.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.619
- On my mark,
engage phase two.

22:35.621 --> 22:37.755
- Ana, hold still.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.361
- Could this feel
anymore ominous?

22:43.363 --> 22:44.595
At all?

22:44.597 --> 22:45.796
- You don't have to
do this, you know?

22:45.798 --> 22:47.098
- Yes, she does.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.666
Now relax, exhale.

22:48.668 --> 22:49.767
You're screwing
with the readings.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.068
Nate?

22:51.070 --> 22:54.071
- For the record, I'm
really, seriously scared.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.506
- Don't be.

22:55.508 --> 22:58.943
This is all you.
- Picture the nobel.

22:58.945 --> 23:01.912
- What if I grow tentacles?
- Or testicles.

23:01.914 --> 23:04.882
A great big, Harry pair of--
- we phase matter.

23:04.884 --> 23:08.018
We take matter and we pass
it through a wormhole.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.954
- Unaltered, pass it unaltered.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.922
- Your point?
The numbers really are dropping.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.525
We should go.
- Just matter.

23:15.460 --> 23:16.861
What if we're...

23:18.930 --> 23:19.997
- What?

23:20.866 --> 23:22.099
- Nothing, no.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.470
Good luck.

23:32.611 --> 23:33.677
- Nate?

23:35.914 --> 23:38.616
You owe me a movie, cool guy.

23:50.962 --> 23:52.029
- Good luck.

24:03.475 --> 24:06.110
- Okay, and on three, two, one.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.861
Hi, I'm James.
Do you have a moment?
- Sorry.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.696
- No, don't be.

25:32.698 --> 25:33.797
No, I'm kidding.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.534
- They're using it for animal
testing, you know that?

25:36.536 --> 25:39.703
Not today, okay?
- Okay, no worries,
maybe next time.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.171
What's your name?
- Ana, yes.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.540
- Ana, that's a lovely name.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.843
I used to have a pet
rabbit called Ana.

25:46.811 --> 25:48.312
Ana, you're in science, right?

25:48.314 --> 25:50.047
- We don't really use animals.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.048
- Oh, of course, of course.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.917
But you do--
- sorry, look.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.652
I support what
you're doing, I do.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.554
Just not today.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.104
- Well, hello again.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.639
How're you feeling?

26:15.641 --> 26:18.108
- I shouldn't drink so much.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.044
Can't remember shit.

26:20.979 --> 26:22.346
I hope I didn't...

26:26.184 --> 26:27.851
Good.

26:27.853 --> 26:30.187
- So, we've pretty much
lost all of our capacity.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.789
We're back to atoms
for the time being.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.123
- Everything?

26:33.125 --> 26:36.060
That was quick.
- Was it really?

26:36.062 --> 26:37.595
- Yeah, so basically
that thing is mothballed

26:37.597 --> 26:38.829
for the moment.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.599
We do have computer models.
- We have.

26:41.601 --> 26:42.600
Sorry.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.201
We have it modeled, yes.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.004
So we can run analytic
tests on the server.

26:47.006 --> 26:49.039
- Until we get funding.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.608
- Yes, until then.

26:56.815 --> 26:59.950
- Everything went
okay though, right?

27:01.653 --> 27:02.853
Nate?

27:02.855 --> 27:04.221
- Yeah, of course.

27:06.024 --> 27:07.157
Why do you ask?

27:11.162 --> 27:13.931
- Okay, so what do we do next?

27:20.405 --> 27:22.673
- What do we do?

27:22.675 --> 27:26.644
Okay.
So firstly, how are those tests?

27:26.646 --> 27:28.746
- Tests?
- You're the chemist.

27:28.748 --> 27:32.750
You said you needed to
take samples, run tests.

27:57.442 --> 28:00.911
- Memories, so many
wonderful memories.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.315
Do you remember the video we did

28:05.317 --> 28:06.884
from the photos of loredo?

28:06.886 --> 28:08.218
I found it upstairs.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.821
I will pack it as well.
- No, mom.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.322
- Ay, let me pack it!

28:12.324 --> 28:14.692
You can throw out
anything you don't want.

28:14.694 --> 28:17.795
- That doesn't make sense,
it's more work for both of us.

28:17.797 --> 28:21.832
Just throw it away,
or give it to charity.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.233
- And the comic books?

28:23.235 --> 28:25.369
- Just put them in the trunk.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.037
- The trunk?

28:27.039 --> 28:29.840
- I told you, everything
has to fit in a small trunk.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.241
- But there's so many things!

28:31.243 --> 28:34.011
- Well, that's the
point of a small trunk.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.345
You kept it, mom.
- Okay,

28:36.982 --> 28:38.048
don't get antsy.

28:43.822 --> 28:45.889
How are thing otherwise?

28:50.261 --> 28:51.328
- They're...

28:53.965 --> 28:55.365
Things are fine.

28:56.735 --> 29:01.305
Just a bit of a
cold, but I'm okay.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.006
- Don't work too hard.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.143
I miss you.

29:47.986 --> 29:49.052
- Hello?

30:35.434 --> 30:37.201
Okay, okay then.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.369
Just please, leave
my stuff and go.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.872
Please leave my work!

30:41.874 --> 30:43.273
For fuck's sake!

32:03.021 --> 32:04.087
Hey!

32:04.689 --> 32:05.956
Who are you?

32:07.392 --> 32:10.394
I don't need to call the police,

32:10.396 --> 32:12.462
I just want my stuff.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.231
It's just my work.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.935
It's worthless to you.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.002
Please.

32:23.474 --> 32:24.541
Good.

33:27.638 --> 33:30.007
- Ana, are you okay?

33:30.009 --> 33:32.576
Your voicemail had me worried.

33:33.411 --> 33:35.145
It must be late there.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.480
- My voicemail?

33:36.482 --> 33:37.547
I...

33:38.383 --> 33:41.018
My room's been broken into.

33:41.020 --> 33:44.087
They took my laptop
and some other stuff.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.058
- Did you lose much work?

33:48.060 --> 33:50.594
- Well, it's backed
up at the lab.

33:50.596 --> 33:53.663
It's also photos, memories.

34:01.773 --> 34:05.308
- I found something last
night I'm going to send you.

34:05.310 --> 34:06.743
It'll cheer you up.

34:06.745 --> 34:07.811
- Okay.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.348
- I love you, baby.

34:21.192 --> 34:23.660
- Don't worry, mom,
I'll call them.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.062
I love you, too.

34:28.199 --> 34:32.569
So I can't even report my card
stolen, that's ridiculous!

34:32.571 --> 34:35.705
I don't know!
It's just...

34:35.707 --> 34:36.773
Yes.

34:37.675 --> 34:39.376
Okay.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.444
My passport.

34:42.547 --> 34:46.216
Can I take a name and
a reference number?

34:47.585 --> 34:48.652
Okay, Jim.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.188
I'll do it tomorrow.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.255
Yes.

34:52.857 --> 34:54.324
No.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.392
Thank you.

34:59.530 --> 35:01.665
But why aren't you
taking this seriously?

35:01.667 --> 35:04.367
Someone stole our work.

35:04.369 --> 35:07.537
- Look, it's not like they'll
make sense of anything.

35:07.539 --> 35:08.605
And you don't remember
what happened--

35:08.607 --> 35:09.673
- no, that's what I'm saying!

35:09.675 --> 35:11.475
After the experiment, nothing!

35:11.477 --> 35:12.843
I can't remember!

35:12.845 --> 35:14.711
I mean, was I attacked
on my way home?

35:14.713 --> 35:17.714
'Cause my room is trashed,
my head hurts all the time,

35:17.716 --> 35:19.616
and I've been--
- hey, hey.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.684
Don't worry.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.720
- I'm not worried.

35:23.722 --> 35:26.623
I just want to
know what happened.

35:32.865 --> 35:35.765
No, something went wrong
with the experiment.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.334
- Nothing went wrong.

35:37.336 --> 35:40.871
You'll have forgotten
all about it tomorrow.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.517
- Listen, it's really
not such a big deal.

35:53.519 --> 35:54.918
- Nate, listen to yourself.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.653
You're being weird.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.789
My passport, bank
cards, all my work.

36:01.526 --> 36:03.226
Something's not right.

36:03.228 --> 36:04.661
- Ah, cock bollocks.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.897
Here we go.
- So what's going on?

36:06.899 --> 36:09.699
- Check your
email, we all got it.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.768
- before you
discuss with us, you mean?

36:11.770 --> 36:15.338
Check your email.
- Someone stole my computer.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.573
- So they did.

36:17.375 --> 36:18.675
- Wow.
- Yeah.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.644
- Utterly untraceable
were your exact words.

36:20.646 --> 36:23.213
- They've traced
it to the university.

36:23.215 --> 36:24.748
This is a big place.

36:28.819 --> 36:32.589
- Liv, we don't--
- this is a big place.

36:32.591 --> 36:35.692
- Look, someone is
gonna come and ask questions.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.294
How well do you think
that's gonna go, Olivia?

36:37.296 --> 36:39.429
- I'm the one
who let her out.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.598
Just saying.
- What's gchq, anyway?

36:41.600 --> 36:43.667
- What's wrong with you?

36:46.671 --> 36:48.505
- Government communications hq.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.707
They deal with cyber terrorism.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.676
- How worried should we be?
- Cyber terrorism?

36:52.678 --> 36:56.279
- I don't see how it
could be traced directly to us,

36:56.281 --> 37:00.250
unless we do something
really stupid of course.

37:13.864 --> 37:16.766
- Nate, how many
days have passed?

37:18.369 --> 37:19.970
Since the experiment?

37:21.739 --> 37:24.674
It's a simple question, i
can go check for myself.

37:24.676 --> 37:28.678
- Will you stop that,
it's getting on my nerves.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.414
Two weeks, I think.
- You think.

37:32.817 --> 37:34.918
Okay, thanks for your help.

37:36.821 --> 37:38.888
- What's that?

37:38.890 --> 37:40.490
- A notebook.

37:40.492 --> 37:41.825
Did I tell you I'm not
remembering things?

37:41.827 --> 37:43.393
- You were attack, mugged.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.328
- Thanks, I'll write that down.

37:45.330 --> 37:47.430
It's good that you
both seem so concerned.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.699
- We are.
I really am.

37:49.701 --> 37:50.834
Why do you think

37:50.836 --> 37:53.937
Why won't you let me help?
- Help?

37:53.939 --> 37:55.939
Yes, that'd be great.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.709
So, how're the tests?

37:59.711 --> 38:00.710
- What tests?

38:00.712 --> 38:01.778
See, that's what I mean.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.979
I can't remember.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.314
- You needed to
take samples to see

38:04.316 --> 38:05.482
if the wormhole--
- come on.

38:05.484 --> 38:08.685
You're saying I didn't
do that already?

38:42.787 --> 38:44.621
Why is this locked?

38:45.724 --> 38:49.526
- Don't you have the keys?
- What keys?

38:49.528 --> 38:50.927
I have been in this
room all semester.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.463
There are no keys.
- Okay, relax.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.065
I'll ask maintenance.

38:57.601 --> 39:01.705
- You know, I dreamed
about this room last night.

39:01.707 --> 39:05.675
- Someone must've
locked it, I'll check.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.877
- Who else has been in here?

39:09.980 --> 39:11.681
They have my laptop.

39:11.683 --> 39:12.949
Maybe they're
after the project--

39:12.951 --> 39:14.617
- we're here all the time.

39:14.619 --> 39:18.521
Nobody's after our
project, don't be paranoid.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.523
- My project.

39:21.592 --> 39:23.727
- Yes, Ana, your project.

39:24.962 --> 39:26.730
Are you okay?

39:26.732 --> 39:27.864
You didn't eat lunch.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.799
Get some rest.

39:29.801 --> 39:34.804
and we'll go over them
in the morning, okay?

39:39.009 --> 39:40.076
- Nate.

39:51.856 --> 39:53.823
- Don't antagonize her, okay?

39:53.825 --> 39:55.425
- She winds me up.

39:55.427 --> 39:58.962
- She's fragile, but
she's still smart.

39:58.964 --> 40:02.632
We don't want her
messing this up, alright?

41:13.204 --> 41:14.471
- Hey, where did you get that?

41:14.473 --> 41:15.939
Where did you get that mask?

41:15.941 --> 41:19.075
Where did you buy it?
- Let go of me, murderer.

42:19.169 --> 42:20.570
- Oh, hi, hello.

42:21.972 --> 42:23.706
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

42:25.109 --> 42:26.943
Joining us today?

42:26.945 --> 42:28.278
- I need to go home.

42:28.280 --> 42:31.548
Actually, those ape masks,
who has--
- Ana.

42:31.550 --> 42:33.116
Ana, we know.

42:33.118 --> 42:34.817
- How do you know my name?

42:34.819 --> 42:36.953
- We know what you're doing
in there, your experiment.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.821
You have two options.

42:38.823 --> 42:41.024
You do the right thing--
- or what?

42:41.026 --> 42:43.326
I'm sorry, are you
threatening me?

42:43.328 --> 42:47.030
Do you want me to
call the police?

42:47.032 --> 42:48.197
- Be my guest.

42:59.743 --> 43:03.580
- Hey, hey!

45:20.884 --> 45:23.753
- They're leaving
via the back window, three.

45:23.755 --> 45:25.254
Any sign of them?

45:27.124 --> 45:29.392
- Negative, it's empty.

45:29.394 --> 45:31.794
I'll head up a floor.

45:53.050 --> 45:54.117
- Hello?

46:05.095 --> 46:06.162
Hello?

47:57.074 --> 47:58.374
- Ana, hi.

47:58.376 --> 48:00.343
How're you feeling?

48:00.345 --> 48:02.545
- How do you know where I am?
- - Okay.

48:02.547 --> 48:04.413
How would I know where you are?

48:04.415 --> 48:05.882
You aren't at home?

48:05.884 --> 48:08.351
- I'm out, I'm not
feeling so good.

48:08.353 --> 48:11.153
- Your head
still hurting?

48:12.289 --> 48:13.356
- My head?

48:14.524 --> 48:15.591
It's okay.

48:17.395 --> 48:22.531
Something's not--
- I know, that's why I called.

48:22.533 --> 48:24.901
Look, I'm in London
tomorrow with the team.

48:24.903 --> 48:27.036
But you want to go grab
dinner when I get back?

48:27.038 --> 48:31.641
- No, just you and me
tomorrow at the Sushi place.

48:31.643 --> 48:33.175
Nine, I'll say.

48:36.246 --> 48:38.447
Ana, are you--
- yes, I said yes.

48:38.449 --> 48:40.516
- Right it down, okay?

48:40.518 --> 48:43.619
There's a pen by the mouse cage.

51:12.369 --> 51:14.303
- You should eat.

51:14.305 --> 51:16.338
You look awful.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.140
Not like that, but...

51:19.209 --> 51:22.344
I don't understand
why you're not eating.

51:22.346 --> 51:23.779
- What's happening?

51:24.614 --> 51:26.515
- What do you mean?

51:26.517 --> 51:28.651
- You know what I mean, Nate.

51:28.653 --> 51:30.352
What's happening?

51:32.489 --> 51:33.722
- You tell me.

51:34.758 --> 51:36.559
- Don't do that.

51:36.561 --> 51:38.727
Don't make this
difficult for me.

51:38.729 --> 51:40.429
- Don't be weird.

51:40.431 --> 51:41.831
Look, I'm not trying to make
anything difficult for anyone.

51:41.833 --> 51:43.732
- Then what's happening?

51:43.734 --> 51:45.868
- And I want you to tell me.

51:45.870 --> 51:47.536
What's wrong?

51:47.538 --> 51:49.572
What've have you to
be paranoid about?

51:49.574 --> 51:51.807
- It's not paranoia, Nate.

51:53.710 --> 51:57.113
There's something
faulty with my memory.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.582
- You were hit.

51:59.584 --> 52:01.784
- Then I should see a doctor.

52:01.786 --> 52:03.552
No.

52:03.554 --> 52:05.754
It has to do with the wormhole.

52:05.756 --> 52:07.756
- You're seeing a doctor.

52:07.758 --> 52:10.726
You've got an mri
scan in two weeks.

52:10.728 --> 52:11.794
- Do I now?

52:12.729 --> 52:15.231
See, that's what I mean.

52:15.233 --> 52:19.435
I'm having trouble remembering
things, recent things.

52:19.437 --> 52:23.539
- Well, we tested for that
with the mice and with the cat.

52:23.541 --> 52:25.774
- I don't know what it is.

52:26.843 --> 52:28.777
And you guys, I mean.

52:28.779 --> 52:31.313
You're not helping.
- Ana.

52:31.315 --> 52:32.515
- What?

52:32.517 --> 52:35.684
- You've told us this
before, all of it.

52:36.786 --> 52:37.853
Told us.

52:42.292 --> 52:46.495
Look, Ana, I need you
to stop investigating.

52:46.497 --> 52:49.798
The detective stuff,
it's dangerous.

52:49.800 --> 52:53.569
I mean, with the government
agency and the worm and...

52:53.571 --> 52:57.306
They're sending
someone to investigate.

52:57.308 --> 53:00.342
Ana, I need you to
trust me on this.

53:03.380 --> 53:06.182
Do you remember two summers ago,

53:06.184 --> 53:10.953
we went climbing in the quarry
with the ropes and stuff?

53:10.955 --> 53:12.521
Remember how I got stuck?

53:12.523 --> 53:14.190
Like, really stuck?

53:16.726 --> 53:18.427
And I was scared.

53:19.863 --> 53:22.865
I think I even cried a little.

53:22.867 --> 53:25.568
- You cried a lot, Nate.

53:25.570 --> 53:28.571
I didn't know grown men
could cry like that.

53:28.573 --> 53:29.872
- I was scared.

53:31.808 --> 53:35.778
But you talked me through
it, you got me down.

53:35.780 --> 53:37.213
I trusted you.

53:38.915 --> 53:42.418
And I trusted that you wouldn't
tell anyone else, either.

53:42.420 --> 53:44.320
- I never did.

53:44.322 --> 53:45.554
Except my mom.

53:46.489 --> 53:48.624
- You told your mom?
- Sure.

53:48.626 --> 53:50.759
I mean, she's my mom.

53:50.761 --> 53:52.728
She thinks you're cute.

53:56.433 --> 53:58.834
- So I need you to trust me.

54:01.805 --> 54:03.772
Stop the investigation.

54:06.276 --> 54:07.843
Okay, that's good.

54:09.946 --> 54:12.881
But I need you to write it down.

54:19.422 --> 54:20.656
Write it down.

54:21.758 --> 54:25.494
Stop the investigation,
trust Nate, trust Liv.

54:27.998 --> 54:29.265
Ana, please.

54:44.748 --> 54:48.484
- If I ask you to
kiss me right now,

54:48.486 --> 54:50.486
what would you do?

55:04.334 --> 55:06.935
- Why aren't you eating?

55:06.937 --> 55:08.837
You really should eat.

55:24.020 --> 55:26.555
- I am exhausted.
- Yep.

55:26.557 --> 55:27.723
Yeah, me too.

55:28.792 --> 55:31.527
Hey, look, your silk
worm is still alive.

55:31.529 --> 55:32.828
I think he's trying
to make a nest.

55:32.830 --> 55:34.596
- It's called
a cocoon, Nathan.

55:34.598 --> 55:37.833
- Your only friend
in the whole world.

55:45.608 --> 55:46.675
You okay?

55:51.514 --> 55:53.582
- Looking for something?

56:00.623 --> 56:02.825
- Any idea what this means?

56:02.827 --> 56:04.026
- No idea.

56:04.028 --> 56:06.829
- What does is mean?
- You wrote it, sister.

56:06.831 --> 56:10.599
It's a prime number,
if that helps.

56:10.601 --> 56:12.468
- Where's my camcorder?

56:12.470 --> 56:13.635
- My place.

56:13.637 --> 56:15.070
I took it to digitize
the experiments.

56:15.072 --> 56:17.139
- Yep, you said
he should take it.

56:17.141 --> 56:19.375
- Did I really?
- Mhmm.

56:19.377 --> 56:21.410
- Can you bring it back?

56:21.412 --> 56:23.579
It'll help to see
what we've been up to.

56:23.581 --> 56:24.646
- Sure.

56:25.849 --> 56:27.583
- What are you working on?

56:27.585 --> 56:30.018
- I'm trying to
streamline the code, Ana.

56:30.020 --> 56:31.487
- So?

56:31.489 --> 56:33.088
- So we can operate
the generator again

56:33.090 --> 56:35.657
without all those illegally
acquired processors.

56:35.659 --> 56:36.725
Happy?

56:38.027 --> 56:41.029
- Why don't you call your mom?

56:41.031 --> 56:42.865
How is she, anyway?

56:42.867 --> 56:45.134
How did her move go?
- My mother?

56:45.136 --> 56:47.936
Why, is she involved in this?

56:47.938 --> 56:49.838
- Oh, my god.

56:49.840 --> 56:50.839
- Look, you want me out of here.

56:50.841 --> 56:52.074
I get it.

56:52.076 --> 56:53.976
Why mention my mother?

56:56.646 --> 56:58.013
What is going on?

56:58.015 --> 57:01.617
I dream about this
door, I dream about it!

57:01.619 --> 57:04.686
- Hey, you guys
better come join us.

57:07.857 --> 57:09.958
The vice chancellor's here.

57:21.070 --> 57:22.971
- So, as I was saying,

57:24.574 --> 57:28.811
it infected millions, hundreds
of millions of computers.

57:31.080 --> 57:32.147
Apparently.

57:32.149 --> 57:35.951
And it's been traced
to our university,

57:35.953 --> 57:38.821
to this department,
ladies and gentlemen,

57:38.823 --> 57:41.890
from an ip address
in this building.

57:43.927 --> 57:44.993
Well done.

57:44.995 --> 57:50.666
You've actually achieved
something of significance.

57:50.668 --> 57:54.102
This is Mr.
stovington from gchq.

57:54.104 --> 57:57.573
He'll be questioning
everyone in the department.

57:57.575 --> 57:58.707
Do cooperate.

58:00.510 --> 58:04.880
And you're welcome to have
a member of faculty present,

58:04.882 --> 58:09.852
should you wish.

58:09.854 --> 58:10.919
- Ana!

58:12.789 --> 58:14.223
Ana.

58:14.225 --> 58:15.991
Jesus, get a grip.

58:17.227 --> 58:20.629
- Okay, so
this detective guy.

58:20.631 --> 58:23.031
Tell me again just how
we don't end up in jail.

58:23.033 --> 58:24.733
- She's not gonna stand
up to questioning.

58:24.735 --> 58:27.903
- She'll be fine,
won't you, Ana?

58:27.905 --> 58:29.805
- Where are the patents?

58:29.807 --> 58:31.907
- The what where?

58:31.909 --> 58:33.141
- The patents.

58:35.812 --> 58:37.913
You're stealing my project.

58:37.915 --> 58:38.981
- Excuse me?

58:39.816 --> 58:41.617
Where are the filing documents?

58:41.619 --> 58:43.151
In whose name are they?
- They're in your name.

58:43.153 --> 58:45.120
- Then where are they?
- With my father's solicitor.

58:45.122 --> 58:48.223
- What did you do to me?
- I warned you.

58:48.225 --> 58:49.892
- Ana, Liv and i
are trying to help.

58:49.894 --> 58:50.959
- No!

59:01.037 --> 59:03.105
- What did we do to her?
- Yeah.

59:03.107 --> 59:04.773
Ana.
- You said something

59:04.775 --> 59:07.609
about matter, about how
the wormhole moving matter.

59:07.611 --> 59:09.244
What was that about?

59:09.246 --> 59:11.113
- I don't remember.
- No, you do.

59:11.115 --> 59:14.182
You said, "the wormhole,
it just sends matter."

59:14.184 --> 59:17.319
- Yeah, but...
- Go home, just calm down.

59:17.321 --> 59:19.555
- But what if there's
something else?

59:19.557 --> 59:21.089
If we're more than just matter?

59:21.091 --> 59:24.092
What if there's a part of
me that doesn't have mass?

59:24.094 --> 59:26.161
If I went through but...

59:28.064 --> 59:30.165
But my soul was left behind.

59:30.167 --> 59:31.967
- Uh, I'm not sure
i can take this.

59:31.969 --> 59:33.835
- Okay, look, you need
to listen to yourself.

59:33.837 --> 59:36.138
You just accused us of
trying to steal your project,

59:36.140 --> 59:37.739
and now you're talking
about your soul.

59:37.741 --> 59:40.042
- You're fucking crazy.
- Liv, shut up.

59:40.044 --> 59:41.043
Okay.

59:41.045 --> 59:42.077
Look, Ana, we're trying to help.

59:42.079 --> 59:43.111
We do care.

59:43.113 --> 59:44.179
Ana, Ana!

59:45.848 --> 59:46.915
Shit.

1:00:21.751 --> 1:00:23.085
- Ana!

1:00:23.087 --> 1:00:25.654
Twice in one day, lucky me.

1:00:25.656 --> 1:00:27.956
Everything okay?
- Hey.

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.024
Mom, look.

1:00:29.826 --> 1:00:32.127
Have I been--
- acting a bit strange?

1:00:32.129 --> 1:00:33.362
Yes, you have.

1:00:38.868 --> 1:00:39.935
- Say again?

1:00:41.971 --> 1:00:43.939
- No, this morning.

1:00:43.941 --> 1:00:46.174
Did we talk already today?

1:00:47.810 --> 1:00:51.279
- Ana, are you sure you're--
- what password?

1:00:51.281 --> 1:00:56.051
You said I shouldn't talk to
you unless you say a password.

1:00:56.053 --> 1:00:58.120
- What was the password?

1:01:02.191 --> 1:01:03.325
- Ana.
- Mom.

1:01:04.127 --> 1:01:07.229
- Is that really you?
- Of course.

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:10.732
Mom, hey.

1:01:11.801 --> 1:01:14.302
- You said that
you'd say a word,

1:01:14.304 --> 1:01:17.172
that I shouldn't trust
you unless you say--

1:01:17.174 --> 1:01:19.174
- you're my mom.

1:01:19.176 --> 1:01:22.978
I'm not giving you a
password to talk to you.

1:01:30.019 --> 1:01:32.187
Just don't listen to me
if I talk to you about--

1:01:32.189 --> 1:01:33.288
- Ana.

1:01:34.757 --> 1:01:35.891
I have to go.

1:01:36.893 --> 1:01:39.294
There's someone at the door.

1:01:40.396 --> 1:01:43.832
Talk to me when
you're feeling better.

1:03:13.289 --> 1:03:14.356
- Nate, look, I'm really sorry.

1:03:14.358 --> 1:03:15.857
Oh, god, sorry.

1:03:15.859 --> 1:03:18.527
- I thought you were someone else.
- - No, it's okay.

1:03:18.529 --> 1:03:20.328
Don't worry.
- Sorry.

1:03:23.533 --> 1:03:25.200
What are you...?

1:03:25.202 --> 1:03:28.303
- Neurological damage,
just doing some research.

1:03:28.305 --> 1:03:30.505
- Well, good luck.
- Thanks.

1:03:32.441 --> 1:03:34.910
- Excuse me, can i
ask you something?

1:03:34.912 --> 1:03:37.245
- Yeah, I have a boyfriend.

1:03:37.247 --> 1:03:39.080
- Oh, god no, don't worry.

1:03:39.082 --> 1:03:40.482
I'm just trying to
work something out.

1:03:40.484 --> 1:03:43.151
Does human memory have mass?

1:03:43.153 --> 1:03:46.154
I mean, if you could
wipe a person's memories,

1:03:46.156 --> 1:03:48.323
would their brain weigh less?

1:03:48.325 --> 1:03:49.324
Weird one, I know.

1:03:49.326 --> 1:03:50.425
It's just--
- no, no.

1:03:50.427 --> 1:03:53.295
Um, it's an
interesting question.

1:03:54.430 --> 1:03:57.032
You know, I have no idea.

1:03:57.034 --> 1:03:58.300
Have you tried Google?

1:03:58.302 --> 1:04:00.135
- It just want to
sell me USB sticks.

1:04:00.137 --> 1:04:01.403
- Well, how do they work?

1:04:01.405 --> 1:04:02.404
Do they weigh more
when they're full?

1:04:02.406 --> 1:04:05.340
- No, I wouldn't
imagine, anyway.

1:04:05.342 --> 1:04:09.411
- I think the human memory
works much the same.

1:04:09.413 --> 1:04:12.013
It's electricity, ons and offs.

1:04:12.015 --> 1:04:13.181
Like an empty battery
has the same--

1:04:13.183 --> 1:04:14.449
- has the same
mass as a full one.

1:04:14.451 --> 1:04:16.484
I know about batteries.

1:04:16.486 --> 1:04:20.922
So memory is electricity,
but electricity is electrons

1:04:22.491 --> 1:04:24.893
and electrons have mass.

1:04:24.895 --> 1:04:25.961
Thanks.

1:04:28.030 --> 1:04:29.497
One last thing.

1:04:29.499 --> 1:04:31.366
Do you think we're
more than our memories?

1:04:31.368 --> 1:04:33.101
I mean, we're born with none

1:04:33.103 --> 1:04:35.003
and die with a lifetime's worth.

1:04:35.005 --> 1:04:38.473
So when we talk about
the idea of a soul,

1:04:38.475 --> 1:04:41.509
maybe we're just
talking about...

1:04:42.879 --> 1:04:44.512
Sorry, you're busy.

1:04:45.348 --> 1:04:46.648
Thanks, anyway.

1:04:48.084 --> 1:04:50.418
- Good luck with your work.

1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:52.287
- Thank you.

1:06:16.138 --> 1:06:18.440
- Someone with a key?

1:06:18.442 --> 1:06:20.241
Yeah, I'll hold.

1:06:20.243 --> 1:06:22.344
- Oh, yeah.
They're asking everyone.

1:06:22.346 --> 1:06:25.447
Someone broke in over
at the chemistry lab.

1:06:25.449 --> 1:06:26.748
Probably some drugs, then.

1:06:26.750 --> 1:06:28.450
- These protestors are horrid.

1:06:28.452 --> 1:06:30.218
They shouldn't allowed to
harass people like that.

1:06:30.220 --> 1:06:32.487
- I know, right?
This is Oxford.

1:06:32.489 --> 1:06:35.490
- Tracy said her
rep said they'll be
arresting someone today

1:06:35.492 --> 1:06:37.459
for the Internet thing.

1:06:50.506 --> 1:06:53.174
- Ana, hi. You um...
- Don't.

1:06:53.176 --> 1:06:54.442
I don't trust you.

1:06:54.444 --> 1:06:56.444
I don't believe you,
so just don't, okay?

1:06:56.446 --> 1:06:57.779
- You heard about the break in?

1:06:57.781 --> 1:06:59.247
- I did, actually.

1:06:59.249 --> 1:07:01.516
- A protester, they
think, a week ago.

1:07:01.518 --> 1:07:04.219
Caught on cctv, though they
can't make out the face.

1:07:04.221 --> 1:07:06.087
- Couldn't they?
- You muppet.

1:07:06.089 --> 1:07:07.355
Why the hell are you breaking--

1:07:07.357 --> 1:07:10.458
- something's very wrong
with me, you know this.

1:07:10.460 --> 1:07:12.293
- Yes, something is.

1:07:12.295 --> 1:07:14.396
- Because of that.

1:07:14.398 --> 1:07:15.764
- It's complicated.

1:07:15.766 --> 1:07:17.165
- I'm sure it is.

1:07:17.167 --> 1:07:18.166
- It's not
what you think.

1:07:18.168 --> 1:07:20.535
- What do I think, Nate?

1:07:20.537 --> 1:07:21.603
Tell me.

1:07:23.506 --> 1:07:26.408
Look, I'm like a crazy person.

1:07:26.410 --> 1:07:29.544
So whatever you did
to me, well done.

1:07:30.713 --> 1:07:32.380
It worked.
- Yeah.

1:07:32.382 --> 1:07:33.815
Ana, there is something
wrong with you,

1:07:33.817 --> 1:07:36.418
but we don't know how--
- you're lying.

1:07:36.420 --> 1:07:39.621
You want the project,
but it's my project.

1:07:39.623 --> 1:07:42.690
It's mine, and I'm
closing it down.

1:07:42.692 --> 1:07:44.559
- Ana, what have you done?

1:07:44.561 --> 1:07:46.461
- Hello, somebody
call maintenance?

1:07:46.463 --> 1:07:48.763
- Yes, we need the keys
for the storage room.

1:07:48.765 --> 1:07:50.365
Can you open it?

1:07:57.673 --> 1:07:58.773
- Ana.

1:07:59.642 --> 1:08:00.708
- Nathan.

1:08:08.851 --> 1:08:11.820
- I gave you the key
for this already.

1:08:11.822 --> 1:08:13.655
You said you would
bring it right back.

1:08:13.657 --> 1:08:15.457
- No, I don't think it was--

1:08:15.459 --> 1:08:16.591
- that's right, darlin'.

1:08:16.593 --> 1:08:17.625
We were stood right here.

1:08:17.627 --> 1:08:22.564
- Not without the key and
if you've lost the only one,

1:08:22.566 --> 1:08:23.865
I'll have to fetch
a member of faculty.

1:08:23.867 --> 1:08:25.467
- That won't be necessary.

1:08:25.469 --> 1:08:26.701
We'll find it.

1:08:33.509 --> 1:08:34.576
What the hell are you doing?

1:08:34.578 --> 1:08:35.844
Are you nuts?

1:08:35.846 --> 1:08:37.545
We broke the law!

1:08:37.547 --> 1:08:39.447
There's police everywhere,
and you want to bring some,

1:08:39.449 --> 1:08:41.249
some pissant farm
hand down here.

1:08:41.251 --> 1:08:42.884
And what if he goes to the vc?

1:08:42.886 --> 1:08:44.619
And the vc goes, gee, heck.

1:08:44.621 --> 1:08:46.688
You know, all this kooky
stuff and the government

1:08:46.690 --> 1:08:49.457
are investigating us because
for some damn worm virus--

1:08:49.459 --> 1:08:50.592
- Liv!
- Fuck you,

1:08:50.594 --> 1:08:52.594
you know that I'm brain damaged

1:08:52.596 --> 1:08:54.762
and none of you have
done anything to help!

1:08:54.764 --> 1:08:57.665
- You're not brain damaged, Ana.
- Did I not tell you to shut up?

1:08:57.667 --> 1:08:58.900
Fuck you both.

1:09:14.350 --> 1:09:16.751
- Sir, she's here.

1:10:04.667 --> 1:10:06.601
- Hello, Ms. Carter.

1:10:15.544 --> 1:10:16.945
- Shouldn't
i have a lawyer?

1:10:16.947 --> 1:10:18.880
Am I being arrested?

1:10:18.882 --> 1:10:20.615
- Heavens, no.

1:10:20.617 --> 1:10:23.851
No, we simply wish to
ask you some questions.

1:10:23.853 --> 1:10:26.554
I mean, you are
perfectly entitled to
have a lawyer present.

1:10:26.556 --> 1:10:28.856
But in that case, well,

1:10:28.858 --> 1:10:31.459
then we'd have to travel
all the way across town

1:10:31.461 --> 1:10:34.229
and fill in lots and lots
of paper work, and so on,

1:10:34.231 --> 1:10:35.530
and so forth.

1:10:35.532 --> 1:10:38.700
I mean, it really is quite dull.

1:10:38.702 --> 1:10:39.801
Come.

1:10:41.604 --> 1:10:42.670
Please.

1:10:51.981 --> 1:10:54.249
Would you like a peanut?

1:10:55.651 --> 1:10:58.453
I have this theory that you
can always tell if a man--

1:10:58.455 --> 1:11:00.288
oh, well in your case a woman,

1:11:00.290 --> 1:11:02.490
is guilty based
on how they react

1:11:02.492 --> 1:11:06.728
when the interrogation
officer offers them a peanut.

1:11:12.735 --> 1:11:14.802
- No, thank you.

1:11:14.804 --> 1:11:15.870
- No?

1:11:16.972 --> 1:11:18.039
Sure?

1:11:22.812 --> 1:11:23.878
Suit yourself.

1:11:32.988 --> 1:11:34.055
So.

1:11:35.824 --> 1:11:36.891
- So?

1:11:38.727 --> 1:11:40.695
- So what do you think?

1:11:42.498 --> 1:11:43.898
- About what?

1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:45.333
- Well, do you think you passed

1:11:45.335 --> 1:11:49.404
my guilty peanut test
or not?

1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:52.974
I'm only messing.

1:11:52.976 --> 1:11:54.676
I do apologize.

1:11:54.678 --> 1:11:56.644
However, you would be
amazed the amount of men

1:11:56.646 --> 1:11:58.479
I've had admit to
murdering their own parents

1:11:58.481 --> 1:12:00.515
by offering them a peanut.

1:12:00.517 --> 1:12:01.883
Would you like a peanut?

1:12:01.885 --> 1:12:03.084
"Oh, I killed my mother!"

1:12:03.086 --> 1:12:04.619
I mean, it's...

1:12:05.788 --> 1:12:07.855
It's like a magic trick.

1:12:15.597 --> 1:12:16.864
Anyway.

1:12:16.866 --> 1:12:17.932
To business.

1:12:18.901 --> 1:12:19.901
- Look, mister.

1:12:19.903 --> 1:12:21.869
I'm sorry, I'm really busy.

1:12:21.871 --> 1:12:23.504
- Yes, I know.

1:12:23.506 --> 1:12:25.740
You're a hard one to pin
down, keep very strange hours.

1:12:25.742 --> 1:12:27.608
I mean, most students
do, but you, you're--

1:12:27.610 --> 1:12:29.610
- can we do this another time?

1:12:29.612 --> 1:12:32.513
I'm not really--
- have a look at this.

1:12:32.515 --> 1:12:35.616
Tell me if you recognize it.

1:12:35.618 --> 1:12:38.986
- What is this?
- I'll be honest with you.

1:12:38.988 --> 1:12:41.856
We're not looking for
the worm's author.

1:12:41.858 --> 1:12:43.891
We know you wrote it,

1:12:44.893 --> 1:12:48.396
but what we don't
know is what it does.

1:12:51.900 --> 1:12:53.568
Come now.

1:12:53.570 --> 1:12:56.838
What, you thought you'd
get, oh, 800 million people

1:12:56.840 --> 1:13:00.975
to do your homework and
it would stay a secret?

1:13:03.612 --> 1:13:06.514
- Look, I've been
unwell, alright?

1:13:13.789 --> 1:13:16.958
But I have no idea
what I'm looking at.

1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:19.560
You know I'm a chemist,
not a programmer.

1:13:19.562 --> 1:13:21.062
- All we want to know

1:13:21.064 --> 1:13:23.598
is what it is, miss Carter.

1:13:25.567 --> 1:13:26.868
Anarchy?

1:13:26.870 --> 1:13:28.836
Clogging up the system?

1:13:28.838 --> 1:13:30.738
Are you a part of that?
- I have no idea.

1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:32.407
Anarchy?
- Well, your friends--

1:13:32.409 --> 1:13:35.176
- they're not my
friends, are they?

1:13:37.079 --> 1:13:39.514
Why don't you ask them.

1:13:43.652 --> 1:13:45.620
- We have gathered
here today for one reason,

1:13:45.622 --> 1:13:50.091
- Over 18%
of students are scientists.

1:13:50.093 --> 1:13:54.429
We have murder on our hands
if we let this stuff go ahead.

1:13:54.431 --> 1:13:55.930
- Ana!

1:13:55.932 --> 1:13:58.666
This is Ana we were
telling you all about.

1:13:58.668 --> 1:14:00.501
- She's American.
- Is she?

1:14:00.503 --> 1:14:02.837
- She is.
- Well, that makes sense.

1:14:02.839 --> 1:14:04.639
- Decided not to join
us in the end, then?

1:14:04.641 --> 1:14:08.176
- Clearly not, though we did
give you every chance to.

1:14:08.178 --> 1:14:11.078
- We did, we tried.
- What is this?

1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:12.747
- So, what do we have here?

1:14:12.749 --> 1:14:13.948
Half a dozen lab mice?

1:14:13.950 --> 1:14:16.083
- Only mice.
- Only mice.

1:14:16.085 --> 1:14:17.452
Then rabbits.

1:14:18.587 --> 1:14:22.623
But you've left this
section blank, Ana.

1:14:22.625 --> 1:14:23.825
What were you doing to them?

1:14:23.827 --> 1:14:25.660
- What are you doing
to them, Ana, in there?

1:14:25.662 --> 1:14:28.196
- Witnesses said they
saw you bring a cat in.

1:14:28.198 --> 1:14:29.197
But where's the paperwork, Ana?

1:14:29.199 --> 1:14:31.532
- Where, indeed?
- A pet.

1:14:32.801 --> 1:14:34.068
That's not legal, Ana.

1:14:34.070 --> 1:14:35.837
- That's not legal at all.

1:14:35.839 --> 1:14:37.939
You should see what
they built in there.

1:14:37.941 --> 1:14:39.106
- Listen.
- Should we?

1:14:39.108 --> 1:14:40.842
Should we see her lab?

1:14:40.844 --> 1:14:42.009
- No!

1:14:42.011 --> 1:14:43.578
- We have everything
we need, Ana!

1:14:43.580 --> 1:14:45.079
- We're shutting you down.

1:14:45.081 --> 1:14:46.180
- Shut her down!
Shut her down!

1:14:47.483 --> 1:14:49.550
Shut her down!
Shut her down!

1:14:49.552 --> 1:14:51.586
Shut her down!
Shut her down!

1:14:51.588 --> 1:14:54.021
Shut her down!
Shut her down!
- Aw!

1:14:54.023 --> 1:14:56.791
We're only joking, Ana!

1:14:56.793 --> 1:14:57.859
- Wah-wah.

1:15:36.231 --> 1:15:37.298
- My notes.

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:00.288
What's wrong with me?

1:16:25.347 --> 1:16:27.915
Hi, I think I left
something here last time.

1:16:27.917 --> 1:16:30.785
- Oh, well
come in, come in.

1:16:30.787 --> 1:16:32.753
Would you like some tea?

1:16:32.755 --> 1:16:35.122
- I would love some tea.

1:16:36.625 --> 1:16:37.658
- Ana!

1:16:37.660 --> 1:16:39.327
Hey, look, are you okay?
- Peachy.

1:16:39.329 --> 1:16:41.295
- Where are you?

1:16:41.297 --> 1:16:42.964
Can you come back to the lab?

1:16:42.966 --> 1:16:44.765
- All I wanted was for you
to explain what was going on.

1:16:44.767 --> 1:16:47.101
- We explained
it to you so many times.

1:16:48.237 --> 1:16:49.904
Ana, you just keep forgetting.

1:16:49.906 --> 1:16:51.272
Look, look, I'm sorry.

1:16:51.274 --> 1:16:54.976
Can you just come
back to the lab?

1:16:54.978 --> 1:16:56.644
Ana?
- Goodbye, Nathan.

1:16:56.646 --> 1:16:58.145
- Ana?

1:19:17.018 --> 1:19:18.119
- Yes, she does!

1:19:18.121 --> 1:19:19.353
Now relax, exhale.

1:19:19.355 --> 1:19:21.255
You're screwing
with the readings.

1:19:21.257 --> 1:19:22.890
Nate.
- We phase matter.

1:19:22.892 --> 1:19:25.092
We take matter and
we pass it through--

1:19:25.094 --> 1:19:26.894
- unaltered, pass it unaltered.

1:19:26.896 --> 1:19:28.062
- Your point?

1:19:28.064 --> 1:19:30.231
Numbers really are
dropping, we have to go!

1:19:30.233 --> 1:19:31.265
- Just matter, right?

1:19:31.267 --> 1:19:32.867
We're...
- What?

1:19:35.203 --> 1:19:37.238
- Nothing, no.

1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:38.339
- Nate?

1:19:40.809 --> 1:19:43.310
You owe me a movie, cool guy.

1:19:56.258 --> 1:19:57.424
- Okay.

1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:00.327
And on three, two, one.

1:20:16.111 --> 1:20:18.479
- 271 apparently successful.

1:20:18.481 --> 1:20:21.215
Readings inconclusive,
couldn't map the subsets.

1:20:21.217 --> 1:20:22.917
The wormhole stays
open too long.

1:20:22.919 --> 1:20:25.286
Gravitational distortion,
needs to close instantaneously

1:20:25.288 --> 1:20:26.453
to do a wormhole.

1:20:26.455 --> 1:20:28.522
Guys, we have a problem.

1:20:42.103 --> 1:20:43.170
Two, one.

1:20:48.411 --> 1:20:50.244
Two, one.

1:20:53.349 --> 1:20:54.415
Two, one.

1:21:10.498 --> 1:21:13.133
- Ana, what are you doing here?

1:21:13.969 --> 1:21:17.304
- I'm...
I mean, what are you doing here?

1:21:17.306 --> 1:21:18.873
- It's my room.

1:21:18.875 --> 1:21:21.375
- How did you know I was here?

1:21:21.377 --> 1:21:22.943
- It's my room, i
was coming home.

1:21:22.945 --> 1:21:24.879
- You were at the lab.

1:21:24.881 --> 1:21:26.981
You were at the lab, how
did you know I was here?

1:21:26.983 --> 1:21:28.182
- Ana, listen--

1:21:28.184 --> 1:21:30.517
- how did you know I was here?!

1:21:30.519 --> 1:21:33.287
- Jesus.
Look, you told me.

1:21:33.289 --> 1:21:34.521
You told me you were here.

1:21:34.523 --> 1:21:36.257
- You're sleeping with Liv,

1:21:36.259 --> 1:21:37.291
which I don't give a fuck about.

1:21:37.293 --> 1:21:39.059
But Nate, you're not stupid.

1:21:39.061 --> 1:21:41.395
You must know how
much that hurts me.

1:21:41.397 --> 1:21:43.297
I thought you and me, we had--

1:21:43.299 --> 1:21:45.132
- forget about Liv, please!

1:21:45.134 --> 1:21:47.601
Look, and you're the one
going through my underwear.

1:21:47.603 --> 1:21:49.937
So just, enough.

1:21:49.939 --> 1:21:51.906
We never realized how badly
this was affecting you.

1:21:51.908 --> 1:21:54.675
- Affecting, Nate?
Affecting?

1:21:54.677 --> 1:21:56.410
I'm losing my mind!

1:21:56.412 --> 1:21:58.512
I don't eat, I don't drink.

1:21:58.514 --> 1:22:00.214
My dreams are insane.

1:22:00.216 --> 1:22:02.049
I have no memories, I have
to make notes all the time.

1:22:02.051 --> 1:22:03.617
It's--
- you can have them back.

1:22:03.619 --> 1:22:05.953
- I don't want them back!

1:22:10.158 --> 1:22:11.392
I do things behind
my own back and--

1:22:11.394 --> 1:22:14.328
- please, just put that down.

1:22:14.330 --> 1:22:15.429
Come to the lab.

1:22:15.431 --> 1:22:18.065
We can explain it there.
- Explain now.

1:22:18.067 --> 1:22:19.300
- No.

1:22:19.302 --> 1:22:21.001
No, you won't remember.

1:22:21.003 --> 1:22:22.002
Come to the lab.

1:22:22.004 --> 1:22:23.504
Liv has rewritten the algorithm.

1:22:23.506 --> 1:22:25.539
- What is happening to me, Nate?

1:22:25.541 --> 1:22:27.207
What is that?

1:22:27.209 --> 1:22:28.442
What is that?!

1:22:28.444 --> 1:22:29.510
Why don't I eat?

1:22:29.512 --> 1:22:32.279
Why don't I remember?

1:22:39.321 --> 1:22:40.688
Answer it.

1:22:40.690 --> 1:22:42.623
- Don't threaten me.

1:22:42.625 --> 1:22:44.124
I'm trying to help.

1:22:44.126 --> 1:22:46.327
- Answer the phone.

1:22:46.329 --> 1:22:48.462
You want me to trust you?

1:22:50.198 --> 1:22:51.265
- Okay.

1:22:56.338 --> 1:22:57.404
Hello.

1:22:58.106 --> 1:22:59.974
No, no, I'm with her now.

1:22:59.976 --> 1:23:01.041
- Who is it?

1:23:02.577 --> 1:23:05.212
Who is it?
Who is it?

1:23:20.730 --> 1:23:22.496
- This is
Ana Carter, U.S. citizen.

1:23:22.498 --> 1:23:26.633
Ana Carter, Ana
Carter, Ana Carter...

1:23:26.635 --> 1:23:28.168
Something's not right.

1:23:28.170 --> 1:23:29.570
- Everything will change.

1:23:29.572 --> 1:23:32.239
People, we're going to be gods.

1:23:35.310 --> 1:23:38.012
- It doesn't
look like I thought it would.

1:23:44.085 --> 1:23:46.553
- It that really you?

1:23:47.722 --> 1:23:49.790
- Why don't
you call your mom?

1:23:49.792 --> 1:23:51.158
How is she, anyway?

1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:52.559
How did her move go?

1:23:52.561 --> 1:23:56.764
- Want
to see a magic trick?

1:23:56.766 --> 1:23:58.599
Want to see a magic trick?

1:23:58.601 --> 1:24:01.135
- You thought
you'd get 800 million people

1:24:01.137 --> 1:24:02.336
to help you do your homework

1:24:02.338 --> 1:24:03.570
and it would stay a secret?

1:24:03.572 --> 1:24:04.638
I'm losing my mind!

1:24:04.640 --> 1:24:06.140
Losing my mind!

1:24:07.676 --> 1:24:12.046
- Do you want to
go see a movie tonight?

1:24:12.048 --> 1:24:14.615
We'll go see a movie.

1:24:14.617 --> 1:24:18.318
Said you needed to take
samples, run tests.

1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:20.254
- I found
something last night,

1:24:20.256 --> 1:24:21.688
it'll cheer you up.

1:24:22.824 --> 1:24:25.159
- Nobody's
after our project.

1:24:42.710 --> 1:24:45.212
- To
the moon, to the moon.

1:24:45.214 --> 1:24:47.481
To the vault of a bank.

1:24:47.483 --> 1:24:50.851
Anywhere.

1:24:58.860 --> 1:25:00.828
- Ana, thank fuck.
Where's Nate?

1:25:00.830 --> 1:25:02.196
Come inside.
- I shot him.

1:25:02.198 --> 1:25:04.398
I need help.
- What are you doing?

1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:06.333
You didn't shoot anyone.

1:25:06.335 --> 1:25:07.801
- You need to help me, okay?

1:25:07.803 --> 1:25:09.403
I've lost my soul.

1:25:09.405 --> 1:25:10.537
- Do I...

1:25:10.539 --> 1:25:13.807
I did the peanut routine
with you earlier, didn't I?

1:25:13.809 --> 1:25:15.309
Sorry about that.

1:25:15.311 --> 1:25:17.611
It's Carter, miss Carter.
- Yes, yes.

1:25:17.613 --> 1:25:19.580
- Look, I don't know why
i do that shit, but, uh,

1:25:19.582 --> 1:25:21.281
let's get you cleaned up.

1:25:21.283 --> 1:25:23.383
High as a kite.
- No, it's a wormhole.

1:25:23.385 --> 1:25:25.185
And they slept together!

1:25:25.187 --> 1:25:27.588
- You in some sort of trouble?
- No trouble, officer.

1:25:27.590 --> 1:25:31.158
She's fine, aren't you?
- I've lost my soul.

1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:33.760
I saw it on the video.
- Okay, yep.

1:25:33.762 --> 1:25:36.530
Come on, let's get you inside.

1:25:41.603 --> 1:25:42.703
- No!

1:25:45.773 --> 1:25:47.407
It was you!

1:25:47.409 --> 1:25:49.443
You did this to me!
- You fucking muppet.

1:25:49.445 --> 1:25:50.677
Come on.
- No!

1:25:52.413 --> 1:25:54.715
- Ana, I'm trying to help.

1:25:54.717 --> 1:25:56.350
Okay?

1:25:56.352 --> 1:25:57.684
Shit.

1:25:57.686 --> 1:25:59.720
Your level of gratitude
leaves a little something

1:25:59.722 --> 1:26:00.787
to be desired.

1:26:05.460 --> 1:26:08.495
Nate, I found her in the crowd.

1:26:08.497 --> 1:26:11.298
Christ, what did she do to you?

1:26:11.300 --> 1:26:12.633
- I've lost my mind.

1:26:12.635 --> 1:26:14.201
- You haven't.

1:26:23.278 --> 1:26:24.845
- Nate, I have.

1:26:24.847 --> 1:26:25.913
I have.

1:26:25.915 --> 1:26:29.816
I'm seeing things
that cannot be real.

1:26:30.885 --> 1:26:33.687
I've hurt myself.

1:26:33.689 --> 1:26:37.257
- We understand what happened.
- Did you see the video?

1:26:37.259 --> 1:26:38.759
- Mhmm.
- What was that?

1:26:38.761 --> 1:26:40.761
Was that my soul?
- Don't, okay?

1:26:40.763 --> 1:26:42.863
That's not science,
and it doesn't help.

1:26:42.865 --> 1:26:45.632
- You remember the experiment.

1:26:47.435 --> 1:26:48.669
- Yes, I remember
the experiment.

1:26:48.671 --> 1:26:50.270
- We needed readings.

1:26:50.272 --> 1:26:51.705
- So we could run it
as a computer model.

1:26:51.707 --> 1:26:54.708
But the wormhole was open
too long, creating a vacuum.

1:26:54.710 --> 1:26:56.843
- Your generator
creates wormholes.

1:26:56.845 --> 1:26:59.613
Wormhole theory takes the
fabric of space and time

1:26:59.615 --> 1:27:01.848
and it folds it
creating a path here.

1:27:01.850 --> 1:27:03.984
- We, your machine,
the algorithm,

1:27:03.986 --> 1:27:05.852
induces an event
horizon at the out node.

1:27:05.854 --> 1:27:07.988
- A mathematical black hole
pulling the subject through.

1:27:07.990 --> 1:27:09.590
- So it was open
too long and...?

1:27:09.592 --> 1:27:11.725
- And the gravity field
distorted the readings.

1:27:11.727 --> 1:27:12.993
Our numbers were
all over the chart.

1:27:12.995 --> 1:27:15.295
- You remember the first
time you went through.

1:27:15.297 --> 1:27:17.998
Afterwards, we
decided, all of us,

1:27:19.267 --> 1:27:20.834
that we had to
get those numbers.

1:27:20.836 --> 1:27:22.769
- The first time?
- We had to find a way

1:27:22.771 --> 1:27:27.708
to shut it off the
nanosecond you were through.

1:27:27.710 --> 1:27:28.942
- We had to...

1:27:29.777 --> 1:27:32.913
Yes, the worm's
numbers were dropping.

1:27:34.616 --> 1:27:38.552
So we had to make
sure it snapped shut

1:27:38.554 --> 1:27:40.988
the moment my mass was through.

1:27:51.799 --> 1:27:54.568
You used the scale sensor to
automatically cut the generator

1:27:54.570 --> 1:27:57.437
the moment it had
weight applied to it.

1:27:57.439 --> 1:27:59.573
- It was your idea.

1:27:59.575 --> 1:28:01.408
- So, we ran it again.

1:28:02.810 --> 1:28:05.345
I went through a second time.

1:28:05.347 --> 1:28:06.413
But then...

1:28:07.815 --> 1:28:09.850
After that I can't...

1:28:09.852 --> 1:28:11.285
What happened?

1:28:22.363 --> 1:28:24.931
- Three, two, one.

1:28:32.373 --> 1:28:34.875
271 apparently successful.
- What?

1:28:34.877 --> 1:28:36.076
- Keep watching.

1:28:37.478 --> 1:28:39.713
The wormhole stays
open too long.

1:28:39.715 --> 1:28:41.782
Guys, we have a problem.

1:28:44.886 --> 1:28:48.055
Okay, so there's the out node
with the scale sensor cutoff.

1:28:48.057 --> 1:28:49.690
Okay, we ready?

1:28:49.692 --> 1:28:52.959
- It's fine, I'm fine,
and we've done this once.

1:28:52.961 --> 1:28:54.027
- Yeah, and the
cycles are dropping.

1:28:54.029 --> 1:28:55.796
We have minutes, seconds, even.

1:28:55.798 --> 1:28:57.564
It's really now or never.

1:28:57.566 --> 1:28:59.633
- Come on, we need this.

1:29:00.702 --> 1:29:01.768
It's fine.

1:29:07.408 --> 1:29:10.544
- Okay, and
on three, two, one.

1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:14.114
- Liv!
- Shit.

1:29:15.750 --> 1:29:16.817
You alright?

1:29:18.586 --> 1:29:19.820
What the fuck?

1:29:20.655 --> 1:29:22.489
- No, no, no, no, no.

1:29:23.558 --> 1:29:24.624
What am I?

1:29:25.526 --> 1:29:27.427
- Ana.
- Am I a clone?

1:29:28.763 --> 1:29:29.996
Tell me what that is?
- Okay, please, not again.

1:29:29.998 --> 1:29:31.665
- We can show you.
- What happened?

1:29:31.667 --> 1:29:32.933
- Relax, Ana!

1:29:32.935 --> 1:29:34.101
Just listen to us, please!
- Tell me!

1:29:38.874 --> 1:29:40.006
- Every time!

1:29:41.442 --> 1:29:42.743
Every time.

1:29:42.745 --> 1:29:44.678
- Jesus, you're not a clone!
- I am, I saw!

1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:45.846
There were two of them!

1:29:45.848 --> 1:29:46.947
- You're a chemist,
you dumb shit!

1:29:46.949 --> 1:29:48.648
All those samples you took!

1:29:48.650 --> 1:29:50.650
- Liv, she doesn't remember.
- No.

1:29:50.652 --> 1:29:52.119
Well, there's the microscope.

1:29:52.121 --> 1:29:53.553
Show her.

1:29:53.555 --> 1:29:55.589
Tell you girlfriend to
write it down this time!

1:29:55.591 --> 1:29:57.958
Jesus, you fucking shot at me.

1:29:59.894 --> 1:30:02.129
- Don't.
You don't need to.

1:30:10.071 --> 1:30:13.006
- So?
- Increase the resolution.

1:30:14.041 --> 1:30:17.878
- It's not working properly.
- Oh, it is.

1:30:17.880 --> 1:30:21.047
- There's nothing
here, there's no...

1:30:22.950 --> 1:30:25.719
- It's complicated.
- Woops, you're an anomaly.

1:30:25.721 --> 1:30:27.454
A quantum fucking mistake.

1:30:27.456 --> 1:30:28.455
- Liv, don't make
any harder than it is.

1:30:28.457 --> 1:30:29.823
- No?

1:30:29.825 --> 1:30:32.159
I am sick of her
thinking I'm the bad guy.

1:30:32.161 --> 1:30:34.961
I've hardly slept the last
month trying to figure it out!

1:30:34.963 --> 1:30:39.599
And the number of times, daily,
that this retard comes in

1:30:39.601 --> 1:30:41.067
and shoots at me!

1:30:41.069 --> 1:30:43.103
Where the hell did she
get a gun from, anyway?

1:30:43.105 --> 1:30:45.539
- You're light, Ana.

1:30:45.541 --> 1:30:49.609
When we fold space and we pull
you across the event horizon,

1:30:49.611 --> 1:30:51.211
we're pulling you faster
than the speed of light.

1:30:51.213 --> 1:30:53.814
That's how a wormhole works.

1:30:56.851 --> 1:31:00.053
You're the light
that got left behind.

1:31:04.892 --> 1:31:06.460
- That's not possible.

1:31:06.462 --> 1:31:08.695
I'm more than just a copy.

1:31:09.530 --> 1:31:10.597
I think.

1:31:11.132 --> 1:31:13.967
I mean, I'm thinking right now.

1:31:13.969 --> 1:31:15.168
I have emotions.

1:31:16.237 --> 1:31:17.504
I am.

1:31:18.539 --> 1:31:20.240
- We don't understand
it, either.

1:31:20.242 --> 1:31:21.475
You're light.

1:31:21.477 --> 1:31:23.009
You have photonic weight.

1:31:23.011 --> 1:31:25.912
You have a radiation signature.

1:31:25.914 --> 1:31:27.047
You do exist.

1:31:27.949 --> 1:31:29.950
- I'm just not real.

1:31:29.952 --> 1:31:32.018
- Not in the normal sense.

1:31:32.020 --> 1:31:35.689
It's why you're not
making memories, or
eating, or drinking.

1:31:35.691 --> 1:31:39.025
It's why your dreams are so--
- my dreams.

1:31:39.027 --> 1:31:44.231
Like, like I'm looking
through someone else's...

1:31:47.969 --> 1:31:49.069
Tell me.

1:31:50.571 --> 1:31:52.706
I know what happens next.

1:32:00.848 --> 1:32:01.915
- Hey.

1:32:05.653 --> 1:32:08.188
Sorry I pushed you in the alley.

1:32:11.259 --> 1:32:13.960
That whole day was just...

1:32:21.235 --> 1:32:22.836
I was so scared.

1:32:25.139 --> 1:32:28.041
You don't remember
though, do you?

1:32:29.944 --> 1:32:31.011
- And her?

1:32:31.712 --> 1:32:33.079
- Well, she has mass.

1:32:33.081 --> 1:32:34.180
She...

1:32:35.883 --> 1:32:37.150
She exists.

1:32:37.152 --> 1:32:38.818
She's the real Ana.

1:32:40.121 --> 1:32:41.655
- No.

1:32:41.657 --> 1:32:43.957
Bullshit, don't say that!

1:32:43.959 --> 1:32:45.859
How can I not be?

1:32:45.861 --> 1:32:48.194
- This is really
hard for me, too.

1:32:48.196 --> 1:32:52.165
I feel hollow, like
I'm missing something.

1:32:52.167 --> 1:32:54.100
- Yeah, like a soul?

1:32:55.102 --> 1:32:58.238
- Hey, I eat, I walk
around everyday.

1:32:59.640 --> 1:33:01.207
I remember what I do.

1:33:02.677 --> 1:33:05.178
I remember what you do.

1:33:05.180 --> 1:33:07.213
I was pulled through.

1:33:09.317 --> 1:33:10.584
I'm real.

1:33:15.156 --> 1:33:19.659
- It'll be alright,
and we're gonna be there.

1:33:19.661 --> 1:33:20.860
- I know.

1:33:20.862 --> 1:33:23.096
- Just don't be sad, okay?

1:33:24.765 --> 1:33:26.266
This'll work out.

1:33:27.635 --> 1:33:31.871
The algorithm's being
rewritten, and I'll talk to her.

1:33:32.673 --> 1:33:34.240
- To me, you mean.

1:33:37.678 --> 1:33:40.680
- Just for the
moment, can we not...?

1:33:50.191 --> 1:33:52.392
- So, what happened?

1:33:52.394 --> 1:33:54.027
You two?

1:33:54.029 --> 1:33:55.962
What, just like that?

1:33:55.964 --> 1:33:57.364
- Ana, I'm crazy about you.

1:33:57.366 --> 1:33:59.032
I have been for so long.

1:33:59.034 --> 1:34:03.036
Why not me?
- Because you're not real.

1:34:04.972 --> 1:34:06.106
- We can fix it.

1:34:06.108 --> 1:34:08.208
- We open up the wormhole again.

1:34:08.210 --> 1:34:10.110
- I've rewritten the code so
that it's no longer defined

1:34:10.112 --> 1:34:11.878
by volume but by mass.

1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:14.681
You have no mass, we
can send you through.

1:34:14.683 --> 1:34:16.282
- Send me where?

1:34:16.284 --> 1:34:18.351
- You won't go anywhere.

1:34:18.353 --> 1:34:19.753
Nowhere, essentially.

1:34:19.755 --> 1:34:20.820
It's...

1:34:21.756 --> 1:34:24.290
It's like smashing a mirror.

1:34:24.292 --> 1:34:26.693
Your reflection
doesn't go anywhere,

1:34:26.695 --> 1:34:27.761
it's just...

1:34:28.829 --> 1:34:29.896
Gone.

1:34:31.065 --> 1:34:32.899
- You want to kill me.

1:34:32.901 --> 1:34:35.702
- You're not alive to kill.

1:34:35.704 --> 1:34:37.170
You're my reflection.

1:34:37.172 --> 1:34:40.073
You'll open your
eyes and be here.

1:34:42.276 --> 1:34:43.843
- I am real, I exist!

1:34:43.845 --> 1:34:45.178
Oh, my god!

1:34:45.180 --> 1:34:48.181
I exist, I don't want to die!

1:34:59.927 --> 1:35:01.995
Mom?
- Hi, it's me.

1:35:01.997 --> 1:35:04.464
I just got your--
- mom, I love you so much.

1:35:04.466 --> 1:35:06.766
I just don't tell
you this enough.

1:35:06.768 --> 1:35:08.201
- Oh,
baby, don't be silly.

1:35:08.203 --> 1:35:09.803
I love you, too.

1:35:10.905 --> 1:35:12.005
Are you okay?

1:35:26.987 --> 1:35:28.154
Do you remember?

1:35:30.358 --> 1:35:31.958
I remember.

1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:34.360
Memories are wonderful.

1:35:34.362 --> 1:35:36.196
Did you get my package?

1:35:36.198 --> 1:35:39.265
Do you remember playing
the piano with me?

1:35:39.267 --> 1:35:40.333
- Yes.

1:35:46.340 --> 1:35:50.477
How can I not be real if
i remember these things?

1:36:23.344 --> 1:36:24.778
- Why?

1:36:24.780 --> 1:36:26.279
- So we can
have a record of it,

1:36:26.281 --> 1:36:28.181
so we can show papi.

1:36:28.183 --> 1:36:30.350
It helps him to remember.

1:36:30.352 --> 1:36:32.318
Now, are you ready?

1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:34.387
Like we practiced, okay?

1:36:41.529 --> 1:36:42.962
- Like that?

1:36:42.964 --> 1:36:45.932
- Si,
exactly like that.

1:36:45.934 --> 1:36:47.433
Now don't stop, okay, Annie?

1:37:11.959 --> 1:37:13.092
- Mom, sorry.

1:37:14.829 --> 1:37:17.831
I'm just listening
to it right now.

1:37:18.899 --> 1:37:21.367
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

1:37:22.336 --> 1:37:23.837
Love you.

1:37:23.839 --> 1:37:24.904
- Mommy!

1:37:25.406 --> 1:37:27.407
Mommy, I love you!

1:37:27.409 --> 1:37:29.209
I love you so much!

1:37:29.211 --> 1:37:30.276
Mommy!

1:37:44.291 --> 1:37:46.459
What about the things I've done?

1:37:46.461 --> 1:37:49.929
What about my memories,
the stuff that makes me me!

1:37:49.931 --> 1:37:52.498
- They're mine, not yours.

1:37:52.500 --> 1:37:56.336
All those things you've
done, they're here.

1:38:11.218 --> 1:38:13.219
Can't I just stay here?

1:38:14.521 --> 1:38:17.056
Please, I can sleep in there.

1:38:17.058 --> 1:38:18.458
Just give me one last--

1:38:18.460 --> 1:38:20.526
- you won't remember this.

1:38:20.528 --> 1:38:25.198
- We kept you here at first.
- Seemed safe.

1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:27.000
- But you would
forget everything.

1:38:27.002 --> 1:38:28.334
- Everything.

1:38:28.336 --> 1:38:29.369
- It was horrible.

1:38:29.371 --> 1:38:31.137
You hurt yourself.

1:38:31.139 --> 1:38:32.372
- You hurt us.

1:38:32.374 --> 1:38:33.573
- We couldn't
get anything done.

1:38:33.575 --> 1:38:35.174
- It was easier
with you out there.

1:38:35.176 --> 1:38:37.677
- It was just...
- Awful for you, I know.

1:38:37.679 --> 1:38:39.545
I felt it everyday.

1:39:06.473 --> 1:39:07.540
You okay?

1:39:10.010 --> 1:39:11.511
- No, not really.

1:39:12.579 --> 1:39:13.646
- I know.

1:39:15.182 --> 1:39:17.250
- Yeah, you probably do.

1:39:20.421 --> 1:39:21.587
I'm scared.

1:39:42.710 --> 1:39:43.977
- What?

1:39:47.247 --> 1:39:48.314
- So.

1:39:49.583 --> 1:39:50.683
- Yeah.

1:39:52.486 --> 1:39:53.987
- Look at us,

1:39:53.989 --> 1:39:57.023
sitting here like
two normal people.

1:39:57.025 --> 1:40:00.560
I feel like I should
say something profound.

1:40:04.631 --> 1:40:07.667
- You know, if i
were in your place...

1:40:08.769 --> 1:40:10.203
If I were you,

1:40:11.572 --> 1:40:14.674
I don't know if I could do this.

1:40:14.676 --> 1:40:16.576
I don't think I could.

1:40:18.612 --> 1:40:20.747
- Yeah, you could.

1:40:33.794 --> 1:40:35.628
Thank you.

1:40:35.630 --> 1:40:39.665
You're an asshole and if
i think that, so does she.

1:41:34.721 --> 1:41:35.788
Go on, then.

1:41:38.859 --> 1:41:40.126
Hit me.

1:41:43.097 --> 1:41:45.164
- Three, two, one.

1:42:02.650 --> 1:42:06.319
- And the project?
- We shut it down.

1:42:06.321 --> 1:42:08.221
- No, why?
- I'm with Ana, I mean--

1:42:08.223 --> 1:42:09.589
- how can we stop progress?

1:42:09.591 --> 1:42:11.290
It's out there now,
we know it's possible.

1:42:11.292 --> 1:42:12.458
- Someone else
will discover it.

1:42:12.460 --> 1:42:16.129
Even after what we just--
- well, because of that, yes!

1:42:16.131 --> 1:42:18.498
Do we outlaw cars
because people crash?

1:42:18.500 --> 1:42:20.633
Or electricity because
it electrocutes?

1:42:20.635 --> 1:42:23.870
I have the mri on Thursday,
that'll give us some closure.

1:42:23.872 --> 1:42:25.438
Then we press ahead.

1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:26.639
It's called progress.

1:42:26.641 --> 1:42:27.773
Did we really imagine
there weren't gonna

1:42:27.775 --> 1:42:29.742
be any teething issues?

1:42:31.912 --> 1:42:33.613
- And the worm?

1:42:33.615 --> 1:42:36.482
- I can hack the
blame onto anyone,

1:42:36.484 --> 1:42:39.385
I just need someone
with a motive.

1:42:42.823 --> 1:42:45.791
- We still have a million
more tests to run, true.

1:42:45.793 --> 1:42:47.326
But we need to move forward.

1:42:47.328 --> 1:42:50.496
And to move forward,
we need money, funding.

1:42:50.498 --> 1:42:52.732
Now you said that the
meetings were back on.

1:42:52.734 --> 1:42:54.867
- Yeah, but--
- good, good.

1:42:54.869 --> 1:42:56.602
Now, then.

1:42:56.604 --> 1:42:58.871
Do you remember all the cool
shit we said we were gonna do?

1:42:58.873 --> 1:43:00.239
Watch.

1:43:00.241 --> 1:43:02.208
Everything will change.

1:43:07.347 --> 1:43:09.649
Guys, pay attention.

1:43:09.651 --> 1:43:10.850
Can we get something to eat?

1:43:10.852 --> 1:43:12.185
I'm starving.

1:43:12.886 --> 1:43:13.953
Yeah?

1:43:14.788 --> 1:43:15.888
Come on.

1:43:25.399 --> 1:43:28.301
- Wow,
that was amazing.

1:43:30.337 --> 1:43:31.671
Wasn't it?

1:43:31.673 --> 1:43:33.406
What a clever sticks you are.

1:43:33.408 --> 1:43:34.840
- I did okay?

1:43:34.842 --> 1:43:37.210
- You were brilliant.

1:43:37.212 --> 1:43:40.213
Now, this is the best part.

1:43:40.215 --> 1:43:44.450
We can go back and listen to
it again, and again if we want.

1:43:45.519 --> 1:43:46.519
- Can
i give it to papi?

1:43:46.521 --> 1:43:47.787
- Sure you can.

1:43:47.789 --> 1:43:50.890
When he comes back,
you can do anything.

1:43:52.726 --> 1:43:56.562
Now, press that to turn it off.
