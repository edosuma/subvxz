00:02.711 --> 00:04.629
[serene music]

00:09.343 --> 00:11.302
[church bell ringing]

00:39.039 --> 00:41.416
In my planet,
the women are barren.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.045
I traveled secretly...

00:46.046 --> 00:49.340
across the depths of space,
assuming human form...

00:51.802 --> 00:54.429
so I'd may came to know
earthly women...

00:54.638 --> 00:57.140
and repopulate
my desolated planet.

01:00.436 --> 01:04.355
I wish for you to know
my true name. Xunobulax.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.315
Xunobulax?

01:06.859 --> 01:07.775
Yeah.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.362
Our race makes love just once.

01:13.282 --> 01:17.160
We put all our cosmic energy
into that one explosive... act...

01:19.413 --> 01:21.998
and then,
like your terrestrial mayfly...

01:22.875 --> 01:25.543
we die of a sweet
early content.

01:27.046 --> 01:29.839
I want to make love to you
in the manner of my people.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.634
I want it to be my last act.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.763
Keep that up, Rod, and it will be
your last act.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.307
I can't return home without
accomplishing my mission.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.184
I said stop!

01:47.608 --> 01:50.818
- I want my first time to be with you.
- And so do I.

01:50.819 --> 01:54.322
Cool, I understand.
Please, Stacy.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.138
What the fuck is this?

02:25.062 --> 02:26.395
Hold on.

02:30.234 --> 02:33.277
Ben!
Get your ass over here!

02:34.738 --> 02:36.739
Mark, is that you in there?

02:45.791 --> 02:47.125
This isn't funny!

02:49.128 --> 02:50.419
What the hell...

02:52.798 --> 02:54.215
Rod!

02:55.134 --> 02:57.093
[screams]

02:57.636 --> 02:58.928
[slashing]

02:59.138 --> 03:00.513
No! Rod!

03:00.722 --> 03:02.598
[groans]

03:18.490 --> 03:19.866
[in a shaky voice]
Stacy...

03:20.534 --> 03:21.909
[coughing]

03:23.036 --> 03:24.453
[crying] Stacy....

03:33.130 --> 03:34.463
Stacy!

03:34.673 --> 03:35.840
[coughs]

03:40.512 --> 03:42.054
Stacy!

03:53.108 --> 03:54.483
No! Rod!

03:56.278 --> 03:57.486
Oh, my God!

03:58.780 --> 04:00.698
[screams]

04:01.700 --> 04:03.618
[slashing]

04:04.077 --> 04:05.870
[scary intense music]

04:30.062 --> 04:31.896
[panting and moaning]

04:32.105 --> 04:33.147
Mmm...

04:35.192 --> 04:38.486
I was supposed to be home
15 minutes ago.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.530
Sixth graders can stay out
later than you can.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.368
[moaning]
[heavy breathing]

04:48.830 --> 04:50.498
No, baby, come on...

04:50.999 --> 04:52.291
No, no, no, no...

04:52.501 --> 04:53.584
No.

04:54.002 --> 04:54.961
No.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.257
Mmm...Stop.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.177
Doesn't it ever bother you
you could die a virgin?

05:03.387 --> 05:04.136
Yeah.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.847
It's right up there
with global warming.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.683
[laughs]

05:14.106 --> 05:16.607
I think we should start
seeing other people.

05:16.817 --> 05:17.900
What?

05:19.069 --> 05:20.027
Look...

05:20.237 --> 05:21.612
We've been dating for about a year,

05:21.822 --> 05:23.614
and I really don't think
it's working out.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.991
All right?

05:26.243 --> 05:27.410
[knocks on car window]

05:33.292 --> 05:35.334
- Hi, Mrs. Marken.
- You two having fun?

05:35.544 --> 05:37.044
Hi, Mom.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.631
Kenny, you wouldn't happen to
have a cigarette for me, would ya?

05:42.384 --> 05:43.342
Sure.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.390
Mrs. Marken,
smoking's really bad for you.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.560
Ah....

05:52.769 --> 05:54.687
The industrial strength.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.608
I owe you.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.278
I'm going to have to smoke this here.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.239
Brent doesn't like me
to smoke in the house.

06:07.326 --> 06:11.329
- It's my last guilty pleasure.
- Is Dad still up?

06:11.872 --> 06:15.249
- My, we're out late tonight, huh?
- Kenny was just leaving.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.668
Too bad.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.051
It looks like the coast is clear.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.345
If you want to beat the heat,
you better hurry up.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.848
Mrs. Marken?

06:31.058 --> 06:32.058
Mm-hmm.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.145
- Your headlights are on.
- Very observant.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.939
Thanks.
Good night.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.441
Good night.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.702
So, is this goodbye
or good night?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.121
Pick one.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.541
- Pick one.
- I think it's up to you.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.346
Don't... slam the door!

07:25.946 --> 07:28.155
Like a little tiny mouse.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.365
Ssh.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.160
- Good night.
- Good night.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.192
- Do you know what time it is?
- Daddy, don't scare me like that.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.194
You're grounded the next two
Friday nights.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.405
Most 6th graders stay out
later than I can.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.365
They're not the sheriff's daughter.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.205
[sighs]

08:20.459 --> 08:22.334
[eerie music]

08:29.301 --> 08:31.260
[phone ringing]

08:35.432 --> 08:37.015
[Sheriff] Marken.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.105
Alright, I'll get down there
as soon as I can.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.484
[car door opens and shuts]

08:47.360 --> 08:48.652
[car engine starting]

08:50.113 --> 08:52.072
[dramatic soft music]

09:00.207 --> 09:01.582
Daddy.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.281
- You're the only one here?
- First on the scene.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.909
The forensics and homicide
are on their way from Richmond.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.496
That's the victim's car.
It's covered in blood, Sheriff.

09:44.501 --> 09:48.504
Over here, I found the boy
faced down in the water...

09:48.797 --> 09:51.632
with about a million stab wounds.
And the girl...

09:53.093 --> 09:55.261
Well, nailed to a tree.

09:55.971 --> 09:59.223
A lot of blood pumped out of
her wounds, which means...

09:59.432 --> 10:03.352
Which means all this was done
to her while she was still alive.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.897
[screaming]

10:17.450 --> 10:20.202
[techno trance music]

10:28.712 --> 10:29.628
Jody, doll...listen...

10:29.838 --> 10:32.214
I'm trying to pump out a special
edition of the paper before lunchtime.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.882
And if you tell me all that you know,
I'll be your best friend...

10:34.092 --> 10:35.384
your very, very best friend...

10:35.594 --> 10:36.802
and you can be
co-editor of the paper,

10:37.012 --> 10:38.220
and apply to all those
Ivy League schools

10:38.430 --> 10:40.347
with those young marriageable boys.
What do ya think?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.516
Don't be silent like that. No, no, no.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.310
I want you to talk to
your dad and snoop dog for me.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.769
You know what I'm saying?

10:45.979 --> 10:48.397
Timmy, I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.191
You haven't heard about
Rod and Stacy?

10:51.401 --> 10:54.486
Are you already taking footnotes for
your pathetic little gossip column?

10:54.988 --> 10:58.157
- Did they break up?
- Break up? Wake up, they're dead!

10:58.366 --> 11:00.534
They flatlined, they shuffled
off the mortal coil,

11:00.744 --> 11:02.453
they croaked,
and gone to see their maker.

11:03.163 --> 11:03.996
Duh...

11:04.205 --> 11:05.956
How can you be so
critically uninformed?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.667
Will you look, the whole school is
buzzing with that music.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.340
Hey, look!

11:14.549 --> 11:16.759
Maybe there's something for my
incredibly pathetic gossip column

11:16.968 --> 11:18.052
after all.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.428
[school bell ringing]

11:19.638 --> 11:21.555
Like I'm not paying attention.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.143
Mr. Sisler, Sheriff Marken's
here to see you, sir.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.603
Shall I bring him in?

11:27.812 --> 11:28.854
Yeah.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.939
Thank you, Diana.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.698
- Oh, Brent. It's been a while.
- Tom.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.625
I don't need to tell you what
an uproar the school is in.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.211
I canceled all the regular
classes for the day and...

11:52.754 --> 11:55.673
asked the teachers to
counsel and console the kids.

11:55.882 --> 11:59.760
I know there are professionals
for these sorts of situations, but...

12:00.762 --> 12:02.179
I thought it'd be best coming fromâ€’

12:02.389 --> 12:03.305
Listen, Tom.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.432
I'm to have to stop by
some of your classes...

12:05.642 --> 12:07.059
to ask a few questions.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.646
I'd like to start with the ones
those two kids attended.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.565
Naturally, you're
all horrified...

12:13.775 --> 12:16.694
by the sudden senseless loss
of your classmates.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.196
Perhaps some of you feel guilty

12:19.406 --> 12:21.824
that you weren't nicer to
Rod and Stacey while they were alive

12:22.033 --> 12:23.909
or maybe you're...
I don't know...

12:24.119 --> 12:27.371
haunted by something unpleasant
you might have said to one of them.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.792
Once, in the 8th grade,
I had a fight with Rod...

12:32.001 --> 12:34.712
And I told him to fuck off and die!

12:35.839 --> 12:37.339
[sobs]

12:37.966 --> 12:39.550
[stifled laughter]

12:41.344 --> 12:42.970
Hey, come on, guys.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.682
It's alright, Heather.

12:47.100 --> 12:47.933
[sobs]

12:49.310 --> 12:52.354
Maybe we'll all feel better if we
talk about our lost classmates

12:52.564 --> 12:53.981
and how we feel.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.527
Mark, you were friends with Rod.
Do you want to say something?

13:00.321 --> 13:02.239
Oh, man...

13:04.743 --> 13:06.869
I don't know, I'm just...

13:07.996 --> 13:08.871
Thank you, Mark.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.794
How about you, Sandy?

13:17.881 --> 13:18.964
Sandy!

13:19.716 --> 13:20.507
Oh, um...

13:20.967 --> 13:21.800
I...I, uh...

13:22.177 --> 13:24.636
I guess at times like this...

13:25.472 --> 13:27.055
...I just hope there's a heaven.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.766
[sighs] Lame.

13:30.393 --> 13:31.685
Cindy, come on.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.645
I think it's important
in times like this

13:33.855 --> 13:35.439
we offer each other some support.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.941
I'd like to offer the killer's
ass some support

13:38.151 --> 13:39.943
in the fucking electric chair.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.488
[chatter]

13:42.697 --> 13:44.114
That's a legitimate reaction,

13:44.324 --> 13:45.949
unfortunately, the means of
execution in this state

13:46.159 --> 13:47.826
happens to be lethal injection.

13:48.745 --> 13:53.040
Ben, I know you have a very different
point of view regarding this tragedy.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.249
So...

13:56.711 --> 13:57.920
Go ahead.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.965
Well, I would like to know whether
this killer...

14:01.966 --> 14:06.512
removed any body parts, or sexually
defiled any orifice of either victims.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.305
You're tragically sick.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.390
I wanna know, because if he didn't,

14:10.600 --> 14:13.435
I'm starting to think this loser
deserves a thumbs down.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.604
How can you be so insensitive?

14:15.814 --> 14:17.564
And you're like Mother Teresa?

14:17.774 --> 14:19.566
You're the one told Rod to drop dead.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.194
You're only fooling yourself with this
display of indifference.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.571
Hey, Jackhole, you're not
playing Death Quake now,

14:24.781 --> 14:25.697
this is the real world!

14:25.949 --> 14:26.949
Fuck you.

14:27.492 --> 14:30.077
This is Ben's pathetic
concept of cool,

14:30.286 --> 14:31.703
He has to pretend he's not afraid.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.081
Well, hello Cindy Freud!

14:34.290 --> 14:36.041
What's your concept of cool, doc?

14:36.251 --> 14:39.169
Bang the entire senior class
starting with "A"?

14:39.379 --> 14:42.506
If I'm so all used up then, why do
you try to hook me up nonstop?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.591
I find experience attractive!

14:44.801 --> 14:46.844
Alright, shut up now,
would you please?!

14:47.053 --> 14:49.054
Everyone! Jesus!

14:49.639 --> 14:51.557
What is wrong with you people?

14:53.268 --> 14:54.560
Jody...

14:55.061 --> 14:58.897
certainly I can count on you to say
something singularly constructive.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.151
Dad?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.822
Please excuse the intrusion,
Mr. Marliston,

15:07.031 --> 15:09.241
but Sheriff Marken would like
to address the class.

15:09.492 --> 15:10.534
Hi, Sheriff...

15:10.869 --> 15:12.828
Leonard Marliston.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

15:13.037 --> 15:13.871
Likewise.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.499
Class, please give your attention
to Sheriff Marken.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.504
Two of your fellow students,
Rod Harper and Stacy Twelfmann...

15:22.714 --> 15:24.423
were murdered
last night at the falls...

15:24.632 --> 15:27.509
by a person or persons unknown,
in a cold-blooded fashion.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.556
The reason I came here was to ask
you, as friends and good citizens...

15:32.765 --> 15:34.683
to come forward to me
or my staff...

15:34.893 --> 15:37.686
with any information you might have
concerning this terrible crime.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.355
[teacher] Is there a
suspect yet, Sheriff?

15:40.565 --> 15:41.273
[Sheriff] No.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.483
[teacher] Well, is there any other
information you can give us?

15:43.693 --> 15:46.153
I'm not at liberty to discuss
the case any further.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.949
Well, Sheriff, Plato says that
polis can only remain healthy

15:51.159 --> 15:52.993
if truth is available to all citizens.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.748
Well, Plato can give out
all details he wants

15:57.957 --> 15:59.750
when he's the
sheriff of this town.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.922
[Jody] He's doing it deliberately.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.257
Of course he is.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.177
All the more reason why
you should ignore it.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.638
Do you think she goes
all the way?

16:17.810 --> 16:18.894
Doubt it.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.146
Who'd want to fuck her?

16:24.484 --> 16:25.692
Look.

16:40.583 --> 16:41.625
[laughter]

16:42.669 --> 16:44.002
Shit.

16:44.462 --> 16:45.837
Stop throwing shit!

16:46.047 --> 16:48.173
- Fuck you!
- Jesus Christ!

16:48.383 --> 16:49.883
[laughing]

16:52.053 --> 16:54.846
Okay now,
I am done with relationships...

16:55.056 --> 16:57.224
but I see a hope for you.
Come on.

16:57.433 --> 16:57.933
Come on.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.726
- No, Jody, no.
- Come on.

16:59.936 --> 17:00.936
It's sad and pathetic.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.188
You watch him eat every single day
and you never talk to him.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.982
My parents have been
married for 25 years

17:05.191 --> 17:06.525
and all they do is watch TV.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.151
Come on, you're going to go.
You're going to talk to him.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.569
You don't want to make a scene!

17:17.704 --> 17:19.204
How are you doing?

17:21.207 --> 17:22.290
[sighs]

17:22.500 --> 17:25.002
It's a pretty freaky
day today, isn't it.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.627
Yeah, I guess so.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.891
You shit sucking liar!

17:41.269 --> 17:42.811
I'm gonna kill you!

17:43.771 --> 17:45.689
Better than a cock-sucking liar!

17:45.690 --> 17:47.315
I'll kill you, you little shit!

17:50.528 --> 17:52.195
What's going on here?

17:53.031 --> 17:54.990
[cheering and yelling]

17:56.576 --> 17:59.202
It's a compliment when a guy
says you can suck good dick.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.248
You got something
on your mouth there.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.960
- He's lying to everyone about me!
- Tell me about it in the office!

18:07.462 --> 18:08.628
[boos]

18:08.838 --> 18:10.464
Hey, hey! What's your
phone number, Annette?

18:11.632 --> 18:13.133
No, it was someone, not me.

18:15.720 --> 18:16.887
What's up with that?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.473
Dylan's been telling people
Annette gave him a hummer.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.434
- Did she?
- Are you kidding?

18:22.643 --> 18:23.894
No.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.646
She thinks fellatio is a
character in Shakespeare.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.024
She wouldn't know a dick if
it's name was Woody.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.526
[laughs]

18:32.028 --> 18:33.403
That's funny.

18:33.905 --> 18:36.323
What do you think, Mark?

18:36.866 --> 18:37.657
Huh?

18:38.493 --> 18:40.911
I think these ribs rule.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.003
[grinding metal]

18:51.005 --> 18:52.964
[scary music]

19:03.226 --> 19:05.310
Come on, honey, we're late.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.438
- Hi, handsome.
- Hi.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.741
[slow blues music]

19:24.914 --> 19:26.081
Here we go.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.835
Hello. Come here handsome.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.711
Good to see you!

19:34.423 --> 19:35.423
[clock chimes]

19:35.633 --> 19:36.967
[door knock]

19:37.844 --> 19:38.718
Who is it?

19:39.804 --> 19:41.304
Hi, Annette?

19:41.722 --> 19:42.639
Yeah?

19:42.849 --> 19:44.516
It's Loralee Sherman.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.143
Excuse me?

19:46.352 --> 19:47.853
Loralee Sherman.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.021
Is your mom home?

19:50.231 --> 19:51.106
Uh...

19:52.441 --> 19:53.567
No.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.902
She didn't tell you
I was coming by?

19:56.320 --> 19:57.195
No.

19:57.613 --> 20:01.116
I must have just missed her.
Can I leave a note?

20:10.168 --> 20:12.127
Okay, just one second.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.383
Could you slip it through
the door, please?

20:19.093 --> 20:21.720
[screams]

20:22.889 --> 20:25.015
[scary intense music]

20:37.153 --> 20:38.945
I think I'm ready for the run.

20:39.155 --> 20:39.988
[drunken laugh]

20:40.198 --> 20:42.449
Hey, hey, come on now.
What's the hurry, gorgeous?

20:43.367 --> 20:45.911
Slow down. Slow down.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.753
- Who left the door open?
- I don't know.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.880
- Annette?
- Annette?

20:58.132 --> 20:58.965
Annette!

20:59.592 --> 21:00.383
Annette!

21:00.593 --> 21:02.219
[eerie music]

21:02.470 --> 21:04.429
[scream]

21:07.350 --> 21:08.683
[screams]

21:09.393 --> 21:10.644
- Grab there...
- Okay.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.437
Grab underneath.
Get a good grip, alright?

21:12.647 --> 21:16.233
Step through, let their weight and
their momentum take them over.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.234
Okay.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.777
The most important thing
is this grip.

21:18.986 --> 21:19.819
Latch on like a pitbull.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.279
[growling]
Grrr...

21:21.489 --> 21:23.031
Is there any way you
could give me some mace,

21:23.241 --> 21:25.325
or maybe a ray gun,
stun gun, anything?

21:25.534 --> 21:27.494
No, it's against the law.
Here I come.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.081
[phone ringing]

21:32.458 --> 21:34.334
- Take 5, champ.
- Okay.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.337
Marken.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.841
[eerie music]

21:48.808 --> 21:51.059
Looks like we have
an encore performance, Sheriff.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.689
Agent Bronhill, this is
special agent Majestik.

21:57.191 --> 22:00.277
- Who was first on the scene?
- My deputy.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.196
I responded to the father's
call around 11:00 pm,

22:03.406 --> 22:05.615
notified the sheriff
immediately afterwards.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.078
We got this.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.047
We're in the big league now.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.513
[Coroner] As you can see on the
inside left thigh

22:28.723 --> 22:31.474
there's a one inch deep carving
of the word "virgin".

22:32.101 --> 22:33.977
The ones we found in all 3 victims.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.438
Like Stacy Twelfmann...

22:36.647 --> 22:39.357
Annette DeWolde was in fact a virgin
at the time of death.

22:40.443 --> 22:44.112
The hymen was intact. We found no
evidence of semen on the clothes...

22:44.322 --> 22:47.657
skin, hair, mouth, or the anus.

22:48.909 --> 22:51.911
No abrasions or contusions
in the pubic region.

22:52.330 --> 22:55.457
In fact no evidence of
sexual penetration of any kind.

22:56.709 --> 23:00.378
Neither was the boy we found in the
first killings sexually assaulted.

23:01.422 --> 23:04.382
Of course I can't tell you if
he died a virgin...

23:05.092 --> 23:09.137
but I can tell you that he did not
have sex at the time of the killings.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.265
It would appear...

23:12.475 --> 23:14.267
that your killer has
been quite accurate

23:14.477 --> 23:17.145
in the application of his signature.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.858
[eerie intense music]

23:22.360 --> 23:23.318
[scream]

23:26.113 --> 23:26.946
[door knock]

23:27.156 --> 23:28.198
Come in.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.287
Hi, honey.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.289
Hi, Daddy.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.333
Listen...

23:38.834 --> 23:41.336
I need to ask you
a personal question.

23:41.545 --> 23:42.837
About what?

23:43.047 --> 23:43.588
[sighing]

23:43.798 --> 23:45.507
It's about you and Kenny.

23:46.509 --> 23:49.719
- What is it?
- About how far you've gone?

23:51.680 --> 23:52.764
Gone?

23:53.682 --> 23:54.849
Gone, you know...

23:56.268 --> 23:57.602
base wise.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.688
Are you two kissing?

24:01.774 --> 24:02.899
Of course.

24:05.236 --> 24:08.279
I'm not a child anymore, Dad.
That's normal.

24:08.489 --> 24:09.989
I'm not criticizing.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.117
I know. I know...

24:13.536 --> 24:15.537
Have you gone further than that?

24:18.624 --> 24:23.002
Listen, I wouldn't ask you this unless
it was absolutely necessary.

24:25.506 --> 24:29.634
Can you go further...
than you have?

24:31.137 --> 24:32.262
Yes.

24:33.597 --> 24:34.973
[sighs]

24:36.016 --> 24:38.768
No, no, but you don't have
to worry about it.

24:40.062 --> 24:40.979
Okay?

24:41.522 --> 24:43.773
We just broke up the other day.

24:45.609 --> 24:46.651
Yeah.

24:49.363 --> 24:52.407
Are you disappointed...Dad?

24:52.950 --> 24:53.992
Hm?

24:54.785 --> 24:57.245
Are you disappointed
that I'm still a virgin?

24:57.955 --> 25:01.082
No, no...not at all.

25:02.918 --> 25:03.960
Okay...

25:06.922 --> 25:09.716
I'm very, very, very proud of you.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.551
[kiss]

25:14.513 --> 25:16.431
You're still my little girl.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.228
- Good night.
- Good night.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.646
I love you.

25:25.608 --> 25:27.525
[serene music]

25:34.825 --> 25:37.494
Parents in our town need to know
what's really going on here.

25:38.078 --> 25:40.371
Does that mean revealing
the signature?

25:40.581 --> 25:42.165
Yeah, I suppose it does.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.083
Textbooks say don't.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.378
It'll leave us no conclusive way
to verify the killer's confession.

25:47.588 --> 25:51.007
- It could also spur copycat crimes.
- This is different.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.219
This isn't a signature.
It's a message.

25:54.762 --> 25:55.720
Message?

25:58.432 --> 26:00.517
I want you to set up an
emergency town meeting.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.810
Tonight at 6:00 pm.

26:03.020 --> 26:07.023
And I want every parent of every
teenager in town there. Do it.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.402
We don't have a venue
big enough for that.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.905
We'll use the gym
at the high school.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.158
No kids.
Not yet.

26:19.954 --> 26:22.455
There you are, Mr. Marliston.

26:22.665 --> 26:25.291
- Oh, Jody....Hi.
- Hi.

26:26.544 --> 26:29.879
I finished my T.S. Elliot paper.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.881
Great. Wow.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.344
I want you to know,
I really love his work.

26:36.554 --> 26:37.595
Good.

26:40.849 --> 26:45.103
"Alas, our dried voices
When we whisper together

26:46.313 --> 26:49.732
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind and dry grass

26:50.734 --> 26:55.154
[both]: Or rats feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar"

26:59.368 --> 27:00.827
[laughing softly]

27:04.665 --> 27:09.627
Do you think that that's how it is
between people, Mr. Marliston?

27:10.296 --> 27:12.630
Everything dry...

27:12.798 --> 27:15.967
and meaningless
and hopelessly empty?

27:17.928 --> 27:18.886
Um...

27:20.097 --> 27:22.015
I heard that you broke up
with Kenny.

27:22.808 --> 27:27.020
What does that have to do with it?
I'm very over him.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.398
Do you think that any serious
thought that I have...

27:30.608 --> 27:33.651
is solely attributed to my one
misspent year with Kenny Ascot?

27:33.944 --> 27:36.654
No, I'm sorry.
Jody, I'm...it's, uh...

27:38.407 --> 27:39.991
[under her breath]
Oh, god...

27:41.493 --> 27:45.997
I'm sorry. I'm very embarrassed
that I just yelled at you.

27:46.248 --> 27:49.167
No, I...I'm really sorry,
it's none of my business.

27:56.759 --> 27:58.009
What's wrong?

27:58.886 --> 28:01.846
It's weird. I just saw
someone standing there.

28:05.434 --> 28:06.809
- Jody, no...Jody...
- What?

28:12.941 --> 28:15.985
[anticipatory music]

28:38.926 --> 28:39.926
Come out!

28:46.350 --> 28:48.601
[eerie music]

29:13.293 --> 29:15.753
- Anything?
- No, no.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.548
I guess we've spooked each
other pretty good, didn't we?

29:18.757 --> 29:19.465
[giggles]

29:19.675 --> 29:20.842
[nervous laugh]
Yeah...

29:21.552 --> 29:24.137
Come on, I have to go to this
meeting your father organized.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.980
- Are you gonna be alright?
- Yeah.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.441
- Hey, Mr. Marliston?
- Yeah?

29:36.650 --> 29:37.734
Um...

29:38.277 --> 29:40.236
Can we talk again sometime?

29:40.446 --> 29:43.322
- Jody, of course.
- I mean just us.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.201
Um....yeah.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.497
Sure, yeah...

29:51.707 --> 29:53.207
- Go home, Jody.
- Okay.

29:53.417 --> 29:54.792
- Run!
- Okay.

29:58.172 --> 30:01.591
You cannot tell these parents that
somebody's murdering virgins.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.552
Maybe Annette DeWolde
would be alive today...

30:04.762 --> 30:07.096
if I had revealed details
about the first two killings.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.932
Jeez, Brent, get a hold of yourself.
You've got responsibilities.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.642
Get your hands off me!

30:12.436 --> 30:14.270
Don't talk to me
about responsibilities!

30:14.480 --> 30:16.647
You and I both know what it
means to walk away from those.

30:17.274 --> 30:19.984
If word gets back to these kids
that somebody is...

30:20.903 --> 30:23.529
murdering virgins, we're
gonna have a goddamn...

30:25.324 --> 30:26.949
...fuck fest on our hands.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.951
It's better than a pile
of dead teenagers.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.760
[gasps]

30:45.969 --> 30:47.053
Oh, god...

30:47.262 --> 30:47.970
Boo!

30:48.180 --> 30:50.681
- What are you doing here?
- Timmy, what are you doing here?

30:50.891 --> 30:52.558
- I'm getting the scoop.
- Then, get it.

30:52.768 --> 30:55.311
[sheriff] I want to thank you very
much for coming out this evening.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.356
As I'm sure you all know...

30:59.274 --> 31:02.318
in the last two days
we have lost 3 of our children.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.822
We have now established a
common link between those killings.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.240
Well, what is it?

31:08.116 --> 31:10.493
All 3 victims attended
our public high school...

31:11.703 --> 31:15.581
and all 3 victims,
to the best of our knowledge...

31:15.791 --> 31:18.125
appeared to be... virgins.

31:18.669 --> 31:20.127
[crowd gasping and shouting]

31:20.337 --> 31:23.923
Holy hymens, Batman!
They're killing virgins?!

31:24.132 --> 31:26.425
You're not suggesting that's
more than coincidence?

31:26.635 --> 31:28.177
Are you close to an arrest?

31:28.720 --> 31:29.387
No.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.264
Well, what are we
supposed to tell our kids?

31:31.473 --> 31:33.599
To go out and get laid if they
want to feel safe?

31:34.142 --> 31:35.560
No, I'm not saying that.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.478
I can't lock my daughter
up in the basement.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.438
I wouldn't worry about it, Victor.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.816
What are you saying about my daughter?

31:42.025 --> 31:43.526
Sit down, Victor, I was joking.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.945
It's a hell of a time to be joking
about a thing like this!

31:46.488 --> 31:47.780
Hey, back off!

31:48.699 --> 31:50.283
[yelling and shouting]

31:50.492 --> 31:51.617
[grunting]

31:52.369 --> 31:54.161
This is totally excellent!
Would you look at them?

31:54.371 --> 31:56.455
They've turned into a bunch of
mindless animals down there!

31:56.665 --> 31:57.582
Jody, get out of the way.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.083
[crowd shouting and yelling]

32:01.712 --> 32:04.005
Battery! Can I use your
phone for a second? Please?

32:04.214 --> 32:06.299
- Please? No, no, no, no.
- You never give it back to me.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.343
[sheriff] Please, remember why
we came here!

32:10.262 --> 32:12.305
- Just give this to me.
- Here, here, here.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.685
Elway? Stop the presses...
Listen, I've got your story for you.

32:17.895 --> 32:20.021
Virgin killer terrorizesâ€’
Wait, you're breaking up.

32:20.230 --> 32:22.273
No, no, no, not
virtue killer...virgin killer!

32:22.482 --> 32:23.858
I gotta get out of this
corridor, hang on.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.360
I'm asking you
for the last time!

32:27.905 --> 32:29.697
Alright, that's enough!

32:31.366 --> 32:32.575
Oh, Daddy...

32:36.663 --> 32:37.747
Timmy?

32:40.375 --> 32:41.292
Timmy!

32:41.501 --> 32:43.044
I need my cell phone back!

32:46.798 --> 32:47.840
Timmy!

32:49.509 --> 32:50.509
Timmy?

32:54.848 --> 32:55.973
Shit!

33:01.647 --> 33:02.605
Timmy!

33:07.486 --> 33:08.611
Timmy!

33:13.992 --> 33:14.992
Timmy...

33:29.800 --> 33:31.759
[eerie music]

33:32.678 --> 33:33.678
Timmy?

33:44.523 --> 33:47.942
Timmy, come on!
This isn't funny anymore!

33:49.861 --> 33:53.781
I'll be your best friend.
Your very, very, very best friend.

33:54.199 --> 33:57.326
[eerie intense music]

34:04.126 --> 34:06.085
[cellphone ringing]

34:09.255 --> 34:10.880
[cellphone ringing]

34:14.136 --> 34:15.678
[cellphone ringing]

34:17.304 --> 34:19.139
Oh...is that for me?

34:19.349 --> 34:20.266
[cellphone ringing]

34:23.520 --> 34:24.978
[cellphone ringing]

34:28.400 --> 34:31.277
[screams loudly]

34:37.409 --> 34:39.659
[screams loudly]

34:42.080 --> 34:44.040
[suspenseful music]

35:19.034 --> 35:20.993
[grunting]

35:41.348 --> 35:42.473
Virgin.

35:43.433 --> 35:44.850
[loud screaming]

35:45.060 --> 35:45.810
Ah...!

35:46.019 --> 35:47.311
[glass breaking]

35:48.188 --> 35:50.147
[intense scary music]

36:12.212 --> 36:13.420
[screams]
[glass breaking]

36:14.548 --> 36:15.923
[screams]
[glass breaking]

36:31.106 --> 36:31.856
Uh...!

36:32.065 --> 36:33.899
[glass breaking]

36:41.950 --> 36:43.159
Jody! Jody!

36:43.368 --> 36:44.785
- Daddy, she was after me!
- What?!

36:44.995 --> 36:47.037
She killed Timmy! She's in there!

36:47.247 --> 36:49.665
- Take her! Stay back!
- Dad, be careful, please!

37:22.032 --> 37:24.742
Maybe the nose was just
a little bit smaller.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.455
And there was a gray
streak right there.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.167
Like that, yeah.

37:38.673 --> 37:39.882
That's her.

37:41.551 --> 37:43.761
That's at least what I saw of her.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.014
Can you make her, Sheriff?

37:47.432 --> 37:48.641
I don't know.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.854
[ringing bell]
Hey, listen to me! Listen to me!

37:54.064 --> 37:56.023
- Listen to me!
- Give me the bell.

37:56.233 --> 37:57.900
Hey, you stupid fucking
FBI sons of bitches,

37:58.109 --> 37:59.652
why don't you come
out here and get me?!

37:59.861 --> 38:00.527
Watch your language!

38:00.737 --> 38:01.779
You did good, baby.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.240
Listen to me, I killed those kids.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.075
I've got to make
a couple of calls.

38:06.284 --> 38:06.867
Okay.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.702
Your mother will be here in
a couple of minutes, okay?

38:08.912 --> 38:10.412
- Okay.
- You'll be fine.

38:12.207 --> 38:13.082
Hey!

38:13.291 --> 38:15.793
- I killed those kids.
- Watch your language.

38:16.086 --> 38:19.129
You're a bunch of sons of bitches!
That's what you are.

38:19.339 --> 38:22.299
And you know what? I loved
killing those kids. They were evil.

38:22.509 --> 38:25.719
I loved killing them. But do you know
what I did before I killed them?

38:26.471 --> 38:27.721
I kissed them.

38:27.931 --> 38:28.973
Like this!

38:29.599 --> 38:31.350
[screaming]

38:32.269 --> 38:34.353
Rolly, that's my name!
Don't you hurt me!

38:34.771 --> 38:37.273
I'm telling you! I'm telling you!
I know my rights!

38:54.666 --> 38:55.582
Brent.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.544
Great meeting last night.

38:59.421 --> 39:01.297
Very comforting to the parents.

39:01.715 --> 39:03.299
Listen, are you alone?

39:03.717 --> 39:04.341
Yes.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.427
Good, because I got
something I wanna show you.

39:06.636 --> 39:08.220
I'm faxing to you now.

39:31.828 --> 39:34.955
Are you looking at it?
Tell me that's not her.

39:35.999 --> 39:36.874
Who?

39:37.083 --> 39:39.960
Loralee Sherman.
Tell me that's not her?

39:41.463 --> 39:44.089
Oh, jeez Brent, you are cracking up.

39:44.299 --> 39:46.300
A few years ago,
I thought about contacting her.

39:46.509 --> 39:47.968
I traced her to West Virginia.

39:48.178 --> 39:50.763
About two hours from here.
This time I'm going out there.

39:50.972 --> 39:51.680
Listen, Brent...

39:51.890 --> 39:54.183
Nobody has seen or heard of her
for over 25 years.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.018
Now why the hell would she
be showing up now...

39:56.227 --> 39:58.395
as some sort of psycho killer?

40:02.233 --> 40:04.276
Put the phone down,
I'll call you back.

40:05.695 --> 40:07.863
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

40:08.573 --> 40:10.866
Were you listening to me?
What did you hear?

40:11.659 --> 40:14.661
No, I didn't hear anything. I just
picked up the phone to call Mom.

40:15.246 --> 40:18.499
I couldn't figure out how
to get a line out, that's all.

40:25.048 --> 40:28.717
Sorry, honey.
This case, I guess it's, uh...

40:29.594 --> 40:31.929
guess it's really getting to me.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.890
I'm sorry, baby,
it's not your fault, honey.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.683
It's not your fault.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.734
Hi, Sheriff Marken.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.069
Hello, Sandy.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.531
Oh, my god, Jody. Are you okay?
Everybody's been asking about you.

40:50.740 --> 40:55.411
Sheriff! Rolly, prisoner wants
to make a full confession.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.914
I hope it's faster than
last week's confession.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.919
- God, you're not gonna believe this.
- What?

41:04.754 --> 41:06.713
Hurricane hormone has hit
the whole entire school.

41:07.549 --> 41:10.217
Word got out that your attacker
has this thing for virgins.

41:10.677 --> 41:13.846
So everyone's decided to take
themselves off endangered species list.

41:14.055 --> 41:14.721
And have sex.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.516
You're making it sound like
it's some kind of a flu shot.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.601
We're talking hymen holocaust here.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.855
But they couldn't print the location,
so I'm gonna give you the 411.

41:24.732 --> 41:27.443
- Where is it?
- The old Donkey Hill hunting lodge.

41:27.652 --> 41:30.821
That skashy keg place?
That place is such a shithole.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.406
All we need is floor space.

41:32.949 --> 41:34.783
Didn't you want your first time to be
something beautiful,

41:34.993 --> 41:35.909
something romantic?

41:36.161 --> 41:39.121
Jody, you have to go!
Everybody's gonna be there.

41:39.873 --> 41:41.999
Mark's going, of course.
And Kenny.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.587
And you cannot leave saving his life
up to that slut Sharon.

41:47.630 --> 41:51.300
Cindy's holding her pre-game talk
at the bleacher's at lunch. All girls.

41:51.718 --> 41:52.885
Jody...

41:53.261 --> 41:55.637
- Sweetheart, how's my baby?
- I'm fine, Mom.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.139
How's your leg?

41:57.557 --> 41:58.390
Mm...baby.

41:58.766 --> 41:59.808
Hi, Mrs. Marken.

42:00.018 --> 42:03.020
Sandy, good to see you.
I'm so happy you're here.

42:04.105 --> 42:07.107
Honey, are you finished yet?
You ready to come home?

42:07.859 --> 42:09.818
I was gonna go to school with Sandy.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.612
I don't think that's a very good idea.

42:11.821 --> 42:13.655
Why don't you go home
with your mother?

42:14.115 --> 42:16.867
Dad, I'd really like to be
with my friends right now.

42:17.494 --> 42:19.411
She'll be safe with us, Mr. Marken.

42:20.205 --> 42:22.748
It's okay, Sheriff.
I'll keep an eye on her.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.670
[ominous music]

42:28.880 --> 42:30.714
[school bell ringing]

42:48.483 --> 42:49.399
Jody!

42:49.609 --> 42:50.609
Come on!

42:56.824 --> 43:00.285
- It's nice to see you, Jody.
- Are you alright?

43:03.873 --> 43:06.041
How did you make it through?

43:09.712 --> 43:11.046
Hi.

43:11.881 --> 43:13.840
[breathing heavily]

43:15.051 --> 43:16.134
Jody...

43:17.345 --> 43:18.929
I almost lost you.

43:20.014 --> 43:22.266
I don't think I could
go on living if I had.

43:23.017 --> 43:25.769
- Really?
- Of course.

43:25.979 --> 43:27.896
What about what's her face?

43:29.607 --> 43:32.109
Ah, Jody, I love you.

43:33.069 --> 43:35.153
But I still have female friends.

43:35.697 --> 43:38.365
- But?
- But...

43:39.701 --> 43:43.745
Let's not fight. Come with me
to this party tonight.

43:44.122 --> 43:47.374
No, I promised my dad I'd be home
after school and I'd stay there.

43:47.584 --> 43:48.458
I promised.

43:49.002 --> 43:52.045
Look, if you don't want
to go with me...

43:53.047 --> 43:54.381
just say so.

43:55.174 --> 43:57.009
Don't use your dad as an excuse.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.510
I'm not.

44:03.933 --> 44:05.225
Who's that?

44:06.561 --> 44:09.354
- It's my bodyguard.
- Bodyguard?

44:09.981 --> 44:10.856
Yeah.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.317
I told my dad I'd be home at 3.

44:13.860 --> 44:15.360
But you'll come with me?

44:16.029 --> 44:17.988
You'll come with me later
and we'll go together?

44:18.197 --> 44:19.698
I'll think about it.

44:34.631 --> 44:35.631
[laughs]

44:37.091 --> 44:39.801
Girls have to do everything.

44:40.011 --> 44:41.887
Boys are totally clueless when
it comes to sex.

44:42.263 --> 44:44.306
It starts with them
trying to unhook our bras,

44:44.515 --> 44:46.683
fumbling around and it never changes.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.186
Wait until they try to put
their dicks in you.

44:49.395 --> 44:50.020
[giggling]

44:50.229 --> 44:51.855
Please don't say they
need help with that?

44:52.649 --> 44:53.565
Always.

44:55.902 --> 44:57.110
What about birth control?

44:57.862 --> 44:59.821
Girls, there's no time
for the pill...

45:00.031 --> 45:02.616
and certainly no chance
for withdraw, so...

45:03.242 --> 45:04.576
I recommend condoms.

45:05.411 --> 45:08.830
What about clitoral
or vaginal orgasm?

45:08.831 --> 45:12.042
Unless we're talking about
masturbation, forget it.

45:16.255 --> 45:18.465
Aren't you being just
a little hard on the boys?

45:20.635 --> 45:24.638
Dennis asked me today
if chicks had 2 holes or 3.

45:24.972 --> 45:28.100
- Did not!
- How could you not know that, dude?

45:28.559 --> 45:32.187
Oh yeah, I forgot I was hanging
with the poontang clan back here.

45:34.941 --> 45:37.359
I get it that four kids
are dead, but...

45:38.486 --> 45:41.154
I'm sorry, this is
still pretty choice.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.242
No shit!

45:47.704 --> 45:50.497
Next thing we have to do,
is find a psycho

45:50.707 --> 45:52.958
who's offing chicks
who don't give head.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.793
[twisted laugh]

45:55.044 --> 45:55.877
Yeah...

45:56.087 --> 45:57.629
Then I don't have to worry
about one hole.

46:00.174 --> 46:01.133
Nice and good afternoon.

46:01.342 --> 46:02.259
This is Stan Michaels,

46:02.468 --> 46:05.011
coming to you live from
George Washington High School...

46:05.471 --> 46:07.806
the epicenter of what can only
be described as...

46:08.015 --> 46:11.226
the senseless slaughter of innocence
here in Cherry Falls, Virginia.

46:11.561 --> 46:14.271
In the last 3 days,
four teenagers have been killed,

46:14.480 --> 46:16.314
a fifth viciously attacked.

46:16.524 --> 46:20.026
Certain local officials believe
the killer, still at large...

46:20.236 --> 46:23.321
may be targeting teenage
high school virgins.

46:23.740 --> 46:25.240
And now, students
here on campus

46:25.450 --> 46:27.743
are rumored have
organized a sex party

46:27.952 --> 46:30.620
to actually eliminate themselves
as possible targets.

46:30.830 --> 46:31.413
[chime]

46:31.622 --> 46:33.957
[P.A. announcement] Attention,
this is your principal speaking.

46:34.709 --> 46:36.793
It has come to my notice
that certain individuals

46:37.003 --> 46:39.963
have taken it upon themselves
to organize a wild party tonight.

46:41.007 --> 46:42.382
I want you to know...

46:42.842 --> 46:45.927
that any George Washington High
student attending this gap,

46:46.137 --> 46:50.223
will be disadvantaged by every
penalty it is in my power to impose.

46:50.433 --> 46:53.310
[chime]
[school bell ringing]

46:54.270 --> 46:56.229
[yelling and cheering]

46:57.648 --> 46:59.608
[driving industrial music]

47:04.030 --> 47:06.531
This report says local
school officials at a loss

47:06.741 --> 47:07.866
as to how to handle the situation.

47:08.075 --> 47:10.619
We'll get comments now
from students...

47:11.245 --> 47:13.830
[loud cheering and yelling]

47:44.237 --> 47:47.739
Hail, hail, Virgin High!
Drop your pants and fuck, or die!

47:47.949 --> 47:52.118
Hail, hail, Virgin High!
Drop your pants and fuck or die!

48:03.047 --> 48:04.297
Hi, Mom.

48:05.508 --> 48:07.843
How's my brave little baby?

48:08.052 --> 48:10.595
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

48:10.805 --> 48:15.058
Don't worry, Deputy Mina was
watching me like a hawk all day.

48:15.810 --> 48:18.228
Must've been a very
interesting day at school.

48:18.563 --> 48:19.521
Yeah...

48:20.064 --> 48:22.816
Definitely wasn't
your typical Thursday.

48:23.025 --> 48:24.526
[laughs]

48:25.236 --> 48:27.529
I smell fresh cookies here.

48:29.031 --> 48:30.240
These are a little bit burnt,

48:30.449 --> 48:33.159
but I've got another batch coming out
of the oven in a second.

48:33.369 --> 48:34.202
Mmm.

48:34.412 --> 48:37.289
Oh, honey. Don't eat this.
Spit it out. Come on.

48:37.498 --> 48:39.916
Then let me get you some water
to wash it down.

48:41.919 --> 48:46.006
Mom? Do you know anything about
a woman named Loralee Sherman?

48:47.550 --> 48:48.592
Loralee Sherman?

48:49.218 --> 48:50.176
Yeah.

48:50.386 --> 48:51.344
No, why?

48:51.804 --> 48:55.223
I overheard Daddy talking to
Mr. Sisler and they mentioned her.

48:56.350 --> 48:58.393
I have no idea who
you're talking about.

48:59.520 --> 49:03.356
Mr. Sisler said that she had
disappeared 25 years ago.

49:05.026 --> 49:07.569
Wouldn't a story like that
make small town news?

49:08.070 --> 49:09.112
[sighs]

49:10.114 --> 49:12.490
I've never heard of her,
and I've lived here all my life...

49:12.992 --> 49:15.035
except those two years
at Berkeley.

49:18.247 --> 49:20.248
You know,
I think you should go lie down,

49:20.458 --> 49:22.000
take a little rest.
You're looking a little pale.

49:22.209 --> 49:24.252
And I'll call you when
it's time for dinner, okay?

49:24.462 --> 49:25.545
I'm wasted.

49:27.131 --> 49:28.548
Okay, sweetheart?

49:45.191 --> 49:46.566
I'm going to West Virginia.

49:47.026 --> 49:49.444
West Virginia?
We need you here.

49:49.862 --> 49:52.030
Well, there's something
I've gotta do there.

49:54.408 --> 49:57.911
Okay, I'll hold down the fort.

49:58.329 --> 50:01.414
But we are getting some calls
from some irate parents.

50:01.624 --> 50:03.249
What do you want us to do
about this sex party

50:03.459 --> 50:04.668
the high school kids are throwing?

50:04.877 --> 50:07.295
Sex party?
Do you know where it is?

50:08.089 --> 50:09.214
I'll find out.

50:10.132 --> 50:12.217
Treat it like any other party.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.679
If there's trouble, move in.
Otherwise, lay off.

50:20.685 --> 50:22.185
I could be gone a while.

50:28.275 --> 50:30.235
[instrumental music]

51:02.018 --> 51:04.185
[eerie foreboding music]

51:23.456 --> 51:24.706
[distant sound]
[gasp]

51:57.865 --> 51:59.824
[eerie suspenseful music]

52:20.054 --> 52:21.096
Oh God, Mom!

52:21.305 --> 52:23.932
What are you doing here? You get
your ass home right now!

52:24.141 --> 52:27.268
Mom, tell me about
Loralee Sherman. Tell me! Tell me!

52:27.603 --> 52:28.478
Tell me!

52:31.065 --> 52:32.607
When I was in high school...

52:34.360 --> 52:36.694
there was a girl named
Loralee Sherman...

52:37.571 --> 52:39.906
that claimed she was raped by...

52:42.326 --> 52:44.160
4 drunken seniors.

52:44.829 --> 52:45.745
And?

52:49.083 --> 52:51.126
Nobody was ever
formally charged.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.336
Nobody.

52:56.632 --> 52:59.092
Nobody was ever charged.

52:59.802 --> 53:01.469
Was there any evidence?

53:02.555 --> 53:04.597
Did she identify them?

53:05.099 --> 53:05.890
Yeah.

53:06.100 --> 53:07.600
Then why weren't they charged?

53:08.227 --> 53:12.147
Because they were from good
families, stars of the football team.

53:12.356 --> 53:14.732
That kind of thing.
And she was just this loner

53:14.942 --> 53:16.192
that nobody cared for.

53:16.402 --> 53:18.945
She just thought she was
smarter than everybody.

53:20.239 --> 53:22.365
Nothing would have
ever come from it.

53:23.284 --> 53:26.244
I don't know if it would have
held up in court.

53:27.037 --> 53:30.373
Not then, and I don't think it
would have held up now.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.542
So, you all just let it go?

53:32.751 --> 53:33.751
Yeah...

53:34.253 --> 53:35.962
She left town...

53:37.214 --> 53:39.883
and nobody ever
saw her again.

53:42.303 --> 53:43.511
And that was...

53:44.930 --> 53:46.931
That was 27 years ago.

53:48.142 --> 53:49.726
Who were the men that raped her?

53:51.812 --> 53:53.229
Well...

53:53.439 --> 53:57.108
Two of the guys left town
about the year after that.

53:58.235 --> 53:59.152
And that was good thing,

53:59.361 --> 54:01.863
because we were all able to
move forward from there.

54:03.199 --> 54:04.490
Who else?

54:06.202 --> 54:09.704
- Tommy Sisler.
- The Principal.

54:12.291 --> 54:14.751
You said that there were
four men.

54:15.753 --> 54:17.170
Who is the fourth?

54:20.633 --> 54:21.966
Mom?

54:27.514 --> 54:29.432
Who is the fourth, Mom?

54:32.228 --> 54:33.353
Mom!

54:37.316 --> 54:40.276
Your father.
Your father.

54:42.905 --> 54:47.825
Honey, he didn't participate. He was
sick, he was falling down drunk.

54:48.494 --> 54:52.080
But he went to the police then, and
then he told them what happened?

54:53.082 --> 54:56.668
Honey, those were his good friends.
He couldn't do that.

54:56.877 --> 54:58.586
And besides, what are you
gonna tell the police?

54:58.796 --> 55:02.215
That a drunken girl had sex
with three drunken boys?

55:02.424 --> 55:03.424
- I mean whoâ€’
- No.

55:06.679 --> 55:08.304
You said it was rape.

55:28.534 --> 55:30.743
[police radio chatter]

55:32.871 --> 55:34.872
[eerie music]

57:40.207 --> 57:43.584
[cracking sound]
[child screaming]

57:52.761 --> 57:54.720
[baby crying]

[police radio dispatcher]
44, 10-5 to 45.

58:34.845 --> 58:35.928
45.

58:36.513 --> 58:37.638
What's your twenty?

58:41.477 --> 58:43.019
I'm headed back now.

58:43.353 --> 58:45.480
Did you find what
you were looking for, sir?

58:48.567 --> 58:49.442
Sir?

58:50.194 --> 58:51.402
I don't know.

58:51.778 --> 58:54.363
Well, I got a message for you to
meet up with Tom Sisler

58:54.573 --> 58:56.574
at the high school tonight, ASAP.

58:57.242 --> 58:58.284
Say what?

58:58.869 --> 59:03.080
Something to do with a Loralee
Sherman. I spoke to his secretary, sir.

59:05.167 --> 59:06.542
Sir, are you there?

59:07.628 --> 59:09.504
Roger that.
I'll check it out.

59:16.136 --> 59:18.095
[rock guitar playing]

59:39.034 --> 59:41.077
Honey, I really need to see you.

59:43.539 --> 59:44.830
You're early.

59:49.127 --> 59:51.587
My parents are total frauds.

59:53.674 --> 59:56.342
- It's disgusting.
- Of course they are.

59:56.802 --> 59:58.261
They're your parents.

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:01.973
My dad's into hookers.

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:06.018
I think my mom probably
was a hooker.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:08.980
[snickers]

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.195
I can't believe
I let them influence

01:00:16.405 --> 01:00:18.739
every single decision
that I've ever made.

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:23.202
You lose your
spiritual virginity...

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:26.497
when you realize
that your parents...

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.792
are even bigger hypocrites
than your friends are.

01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:33.045
Yeah...

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:36.757
[breathing getting louder]

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.009
Mmm...

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:42.013
[softly] Bite it.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.606
Bite it.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.692
Bite it.

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:55.568
Mmm...

01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:57.278
Harder.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:58.696
Mmm...

01:00:58.905 --> 01:00:59.947
[panting] yeah...

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:01.407
Harder.

01:01:02.034 --> 01:01:03.117
Mmm...

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:04.410
- Harder.
- Mmm...

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:06.037
- Harder.
- Mmm!

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:08.331
Harder!

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:10.374
Mmm!

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.432
Let's do it.

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:31.228
Kenny, you've been pressuring me
for a whole year to sleep with you.

01:01:32.064 --> 01:01:33.814
Let's just do it.

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:37.818
You're only doing it 'cause
you're pissed at your parents.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:39.153
Aww...

01:01:40.656 --> 01:01:42.198
What's wrong, Kenny?

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.575
Can't you decide?

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:48.829
It doesn't have to be
this complicated, baby.

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:49.789
Oh...

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.125
Don't you like my body?

01:01:57.005 --> 01:01:58.255
I love your...

01:01:58.799 --> 01:02:00.758
I love your body, baby.

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:05.971
I just want you to be with me
because you want to be with me.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:07.932
That's all.

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:11.143
Spare me the violins.

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:17.650
Hey, where are you going?

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.152
I changed my mind about tonight.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:24.031
I don't need some
stupid kids sex party.

01:02:26.702 --> 01:02:28.828
You have better company
in mind?

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:29.954
Well...

01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:33.916
Frankly, yes.

01:02:34.126 --> 01:02:36.585
Like Mr. Marliston, maybe?

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:38.963
Whoa...

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:41.924
Where did that come from?

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:45.845
I've seen you
hanging out with him.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.099
Well, you probably have.

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:53.227
So now, I should start
looking for you around every corner...

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:56.772
eavesdropping, snooping and
sneaking about?

01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:58.691
[sighs]

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:03.404
Kenny, I had no idea
that your poor mind...

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.532
was so diseased.

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:21.922
If you go now,
I don't want to see you again!

01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:25.134
It's over!

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.052
[door slamming]

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:58.459
[intense music]

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:02.922
[thud]
Ah...

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:05.966
[mob yelling and shouting]

01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:13.974
You take the north side, you take
the rear. Beau, you get the south.

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.226
I'll watch the front.

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:18.270
Hey Deputy, do you want to
infiltrate the party with me?

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.397
Go undercover for half an hour?

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:22.107
Get movin'!

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:23.317
[laughs]

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:31.242
[distant screams]

01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:35.788
[slow dance music playing]

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:44.547
Hey...

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:46.340
Oh...Hi, Mark.

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:49.885
Sharon, you look voluptuous.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:52.221
Eww...

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.557
What is that smell?

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.518
It's just a little cologne.

01:04:57.978 --> 01:05:01.522
I, uh, wouldn't go near any candles
if I were you.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.816
You might spontaneously combust.

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:11.115
- Hi, Mark.
- Oh, hi.

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:17.288
What's that smell?

01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:18.873
Uh...

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:20.958
Nothin'.

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:24.628
I like it.

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:27.464
Yeah?

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:57.536
You like to dance?

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:05.252
Hi.

01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:11.508
Have you ever
played Death Quake?

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:17.348
Okay, but you have
to wear a rubber.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.685
- And I want your CDs.
- Not my imports.

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:24.772
I want everything. Domestic,
imports, bootlegs, works.

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:32.279
Okay, you can have my CDs.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:35.115
- And your K2 snowboard.
- Not my snowboard.

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:39.453
Alright, the board too.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:43.374
You know, that's an awful lot
for 10 minutes of beasting.

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:46.502
Don't flatter yourself, you'll be
lucky to last 10 seconds.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:47.252
Ha-ha...

01:06:47.462 --> 01:06:51.215
You just better hope that when I erupt
you don't end up on the ceiling.

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:57.262
Hi.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:58.973
Hey, Sharon...

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:04.561
You don't have to be nervous.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:07.439
You're the one who's shaking.

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:26.625
You okay?

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.335
Yeah...

01:07:29.004 --> 01:07:29.878
Yeah.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:31.005
Oh...

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:34.008
What's wrong?

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:37.011
I can't face this is
happening again.

01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:40.431
Twice today I stopped a girl from
putting her hands in my pants.

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:45.185
Is there something you want to
tell me? I don't mind a challenge.

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:51.608
Right. Neither do I.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.610
Thank you, Sharon.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:54.820
Thank you.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:58.365
You could've given it a shot.

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:02.411
Hey, uh, I always knew he was
a butt pirate.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:06.915
- You wanna get with a real man?
- No. Do you?

01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:08.167
Ow!

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:13.297
[grunts]

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:22.473
Hi, Mr. Marliston.

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:24.767
Oh, jeez Jody, you scared me. Hi.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.060
I'm sorry.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:30.647
- How are you?
- Good. How are you doing?

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.193
What have you got in this trunk?

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:38.197
Oh, just, you know, just
some old memorabilia.

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.823
Do you want a hand or something?

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:44.787
Yeah...yeah,
I could use a hand with this.

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:46.412
Are you sure you're up for it?

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:47.997
It's going all the way
into my basement.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.420
There, go this way.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:56.131
You know...

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:59.551
You're just about the only person
that I trust these days.

01:08:59.928 --> 01:09:01.011
Me? Come on.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:04.430
What about your dad? I know
how close you are with your father.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:08.727
I found out some pretty terrible
things about my father recently.

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:10.437
- Oh, yeah...?
- Yeah.

01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:13.189
Like what?
That he's a liar, a fraud...

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:15.024
a criminal?

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:17.194
Yeah.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:29.915
What's in the trunk?

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:32.042
Your dad.

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:33.252
[laughs]

01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:34.627
Maybe mine.

01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:48.433
[intense music]

01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:50.227
[screaming] Daddy!

01:09:52.147 --> 01:09:53.438
[screaming] Ah...

01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:59.027
[moody dance music]

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:07.119
[giggling softly]

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:14.168
[smooching]
[moaning]

01:10:56.127 --> 01:10:58.128
Hey Brent, tell us the story...

01:10:58.338 --> 01:11:00.839
Tell us about what
happened 27 years ago...

01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:05.135
when you were very drunk.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.388
Tom Sisler's in the story,

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:11.391
and so is a woman by the name
of Loralee Sherman.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.394
There are people
who can help you.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:21.109
Don't hurt her!
Please!

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:23.695
I'm not gonna hurt her.

01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:24.947
[laughs]

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:27.449
You are, with the truth.

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:32.871
I'll get you started.

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:36.708
See, I remember the story like this.
It was...

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:39.836
a dark and scary night...

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:42.881
kind of like tonight.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.967
My mother already
told me this story!

01:11:45.176 --> 01:11:46.677
You can't hurt me with this story!

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:47.970
Shut up!

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:50.472
Shut up! I'll kill you
if you don't shut up!

01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:51.431
[screams]

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.101
Alright!
I'll tell you!

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:10.158
There were four of us.

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:12.828
We were drunk.

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:18.208
About ready to graduate
from high school.

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:25.299
We were going to a party to
celebrate the end of our senior year.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:32.306
Then we saw a car broke down
on the side of the road.

01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:36.143
It was Loralee.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.153
We all knew her from school.

01:12:46.738 --> 01:12:49.406
She was a weird kid.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:53.452
Kind of pretty in a way, I guess.

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:56.997
I was in really bad shape.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.086
Tom told her to get
into his car, but...

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:07.007
she wouldn't do it.

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:11.053
So, they started teasing her.

01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:15.390
Laughing at her.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:17.893
And then she got mad.

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.813
She called Tom a homo...

01:13:22.357 --> 01:13:24.358
[crying]
and then she just took off.

01:13:25.943 --> 01:13:27.986
And they took off right after her.

01:13:32.367 --> 01:13:34.368
That's when things got crazy.

01:13:36.788 --> 01:13:38.872
They poured booze
down her throat.

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:42.417
Then, I guess what happened...

01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:53.553
Well, you know what happened.

01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:56.473
Yeah, well, I don't remember,
so, keep going.

01:13:57.642 --> 01:14:00.310
First Tom,
then Harry...

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.104
[crying]

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:03.480
then Jim.

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:07.192
Then, they came looking for me...

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:09.319
and they grabbed me...

01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:11.947
[sobs]

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.698
they threw me on top of her.

01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:16.993
But I knew what I was doing.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:20.038
God help me, I knew what
I was doing!

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:23.125
God, daddy, no.

01:14:25.837 --> 01:14:28.630
Happy graduation, baby!
Woo!

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:34.177
I knew.

01:14:35.847 --> 01:14:37.180
[crying]

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.526
[crying]

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:01.163
Did you know that she
was in love with you, Brent?

01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:05.625
Oh, yeah. Love letters, poems,
songs...

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:08.462
All things she wrote
before you raped her.

01:15:10.631 --> 01:15:14.801
That's why she came over to the car.
Because she saw your face.

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:17.137
She never had the nerve
to approach

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.389
the big star quarterback,
Brent Marken.

01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:24.561
You never knew that
she loved you, did you, Brent?

01:15:24.896 --> 01:15:26.938
Oh, how could you?

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.734
She never had the nerve to approach
you before you raped her.

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:33.653
And after you raped her,
there was no one to tell.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:37.157
Except me.

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:39.576
[hitting]
[screaming]

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:43.788
[hitting and screaming]
Over and over again.

01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:52.672
It's very difficult to look like
the one person in the world

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:55.175
your mother loves and hates the most.

01:15:58.513 --> 01:16:00.305
We have the same
color of eyes...

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:02.307
No...

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:04.267
Dad.

01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:06.353
No, no...

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:10.023
No...

01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:11.733
No.

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:14.569
It's a stinking hypocritical world,
isn't it, Brent?

01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:17.572
Where rapists become
the pillars of the community.

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:21.117
And the stinking
hypocritical people in it...

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:24.955
wouldn't even miss their own
worthless befouled lives very much.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:26.748
So...

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:32.212
So, what better to deprive them of
the only innocence they have left.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.298
Their precious...

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:39.177
virginal children.

01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:43.223
[car engine revving and stopping]

01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:52.357
Please!
Don't hurt her!

01:16:55.695 --> 01:16:56.695
[Sheriff Marken] No!

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:04.953
[Sheriff Marken] No!

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:06.913
[cutting sound]

01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:09.749
Does that hurt?

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.668
[doorbell ringing]

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:13.461
Please, help!

01:17:14.088 --> 01:17:14.963
[muffled scream]

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:16.965
[muffled scream]
Help!

01:17:17.425 --> 01:17:18.216
Shut up!

01:17:25.766 --> 01:17:26.725
I'm coming!

01:17:29.604 --> 01:17:33.106
Hi, Kenny. What are you
doing here at midnight?

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.276
Mister Marliston...

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:38.320
Mister...M..[mumbling]

01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:40.405
Something wrong with your mouth, Kenny?
What do you want?

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:41.948
Unh...

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:43.074
Unh...

Unh!

01:17:54.629 --> 01:17:56.838
- Where's Jody?
- How should I know?

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:59.424
'Cause her bike is
parked by your stairs.

01:17:59.634 --> 01:18:00.634
No, it's not.

[grunting]

01:18:08.768 --> 01:18:11.144
Why are you looking at me
like that, Kenny?

01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:14.189
- Why are you wearing lipstick?
- Because it makes me pretty.

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:16.691
Oh...!

I'm gonna kill you!

Mr. Marliston just killed my daddy!

He killed all those kids.
He's trying to kill us!

- Yeah.

Well, who's that with you?

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:15.477

Brent's dead!
Marliston's the killer!

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:24.944
He nailed the chief!

Do you copy, over?

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:33.596
Kenny!

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:44.566
Come on!

01:21:49.947 --> 01:21:52.115
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:56.953
Go away!

01:21:57.371 --> 01:21:59.330
[screams and groans]

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.167
Jody!

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:06.629
[screaming]

01:22:31.572 --> 01:22:32.697
Stay there.

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:36.868
[screams]

01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:43.583
[screaming]
Ahhhh!

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:53.468
Kenny!

01:22:55.346 --> 01:22:56.763
[slow motion] Kenny!

01:22:58.057 --> 01:23:00.016
[sinister music]

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:08.316
[screams]

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:25.458
[screams]

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:50.149
- Mark, don't!
- Man, get back here!

01:23:51.318 --> 01:23:52.860
Mister Marliston.

01:23:58.534 --> 01:23:59.283
No!!

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:00.451
Get outta here!!

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:03.287
[gunshots]

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:13.006
[panting]

01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:17.927
[heavy breathing]

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:28.771
[haunting piano music]

01:24:41.452 --> 01:24:45.621
So you have absolutely no idea why
your father was in West Virginia?

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:52.879
And you can think of no reason...

01:24:53.338 --> 01:24:55.798
why Leonard Marliston
committed these murders?

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:57.884
No.

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:02.305
And after all this, you can think
of nothing else to tell me?

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:06.142
I think you've asked my daughter
enough questions.

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:07.185
Agent Bronhill.

01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:10.897
Well, thank you for now, ladies.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:11.981
[sigh]

01:25:12.399 --> 01:25:14.067
You've been very cooperative.

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.699
[serene music]

01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:23.993
Let's go.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:45.431
[car engine starting]

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:52.772
[birds chirping]

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:02.573
[changing to eerie music]
