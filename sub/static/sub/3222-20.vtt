WEBVTT

00:03.878 --> 00:07.047
Frank Devereaux.
He's a jackass and a lunatic...

00:07.257 --> 00:09.341
...but he's also a surveillance expert.

00:09.551 --> 00:14.555
Frank, dig up some dirt on Richard Roman.
That night, I was burned off every IP I had.

00:14.764 --> 00:18.225
- Ears on my phone, eyes on my house.
- Dick's got people watching you?

00:18.393 --> 00:20.811
Frank! Don't shoot, we're coming in.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.565
Who's to say this ain't the day they
come for old Frank-Who-Knew-Too-Much?

00:24.941 --> 00:26.567
Bobby? Hey!

00:26.901 --> 00:27.943
Your time's up.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.862
Bobby, you ran away from your reaper.

00:34.284 --> 00:37.202
- Hi, boys. You can see me?
- Bobby?

00:37.412 --> 00:39.997
- What were you thinking?
- We still have work to do.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.582
It's not right. You know that.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.208
What was I thinking?

00:43.376 --> 00:45.210
- What do you think we should do?
- I don't know.

00:45.378 --> 00:49.256
Everything is supposed to end.
He was supposed...

00:51.009 --> 00:52.217
Now...

00:53.845 --> 00:56.096
What are the odds this ends well?

00:58.183 --> 00:59.850
What are the odds?

01:06.107 --> 01:09.902
Yeah, I hear you. All right.
Well, thanks for looking. Yep, bye.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.072
Nora didn't see any pattern to
the dig sites, either.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.948
Yeah, because
they got nothing in common.

01:15.116 --> 01:18.994
I got nothing from local lore 50 miles
in every direction of all of them.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.038
It's just old dirt.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.290
What's Dick looking for?

01:31.257 --> 01:33.759
Hey, go easy, you idiots.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.136
Sorry for the jump scare.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.807
How does this work? I leave the cap off
and you just genie your way out?

01:40.016 --> 01:42.309
I wish it were that easy. The thing...

01:45.063 --> 01:46.855
Bobby?

01:50.318 --> 01:51.360
Damn it.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.695
It's hard to stay focused.
I'm kind of worn out.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.657
- You've been pretty busy for a dead guy.
- All right, listen.

01:56.825 --> 02:00.744
I don't know how long before my next ghost
nap, so let's just skip to the skinny.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.371
Those numbers I gave you...

02:04.582 --> 02:07.584
- The empty lot in Cheeseville?
- It ain't gonna be empty for long.

02:07.794 --> 02:11.630
I got a gander at Dick's big plan,
right before he Lincolned me.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.090
They're breaking ground...

02:13.258 --> 02:15.050
- What month is it?
- Uh, April.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.635
Ground's broke.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.972
They're surveying.
They're getting ready to build something.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.766
- Build what...?
- Exactly. What?

02:22.976 --> 02:26.478
They're building as we're yammering.
Check it out yourself.

02:26.729 --> 02:30.149
It's all right. You guys missed it
because you've been kind of busy...

02:30.316 --> 02:32.067
...killing ghosts the past few days.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.154
But Dick is about to get into
the Soylent Green business.

02:35.446 --> 02:38.824
That site will show you they're building
a biotech lab. Right?

02:40.034 --> 02:42.035
Biotech, my ass.

02:42.245 --> 02:45.706
That sucker is a state-of-the-art
slaughterhouse. And we're the beef.

02:45.915 --> 02:48.125
Don't you think that's a little bold,
even for Dick?

02:48.293 --> 02:49.835
I bet no one will even notice.

02:51.462 --> 02:55.674
He's gonna dumb us all down with
turducken-style munchies. Make us docile.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.928
- It's in the meat.
- We haven't been to Biggerson's...

03:00.096 --> 03:01.972
...since that whole fiasco.
Biggerson's?

03:02.140 --> 03:05.475
- He's bought a list of joints ten pages long.
- Ah.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.145
Next, he's gonna cure us.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.105
- Cure us of what?
- All the biggies.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.232
Cancer, AIDS, heart disease.

03:12.483 --> 03:15.527
Let's just say they got an affinity
for stem cell research.

03:15.737 --> 03:19.823
The, uh, Leviathan real estate mooks,
building that cancer center.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.993
- It's going to be a research center.
- Research for what?

03:23.203 --> 03:26.830
They're not hunting anymore.
They're engineering the perfect herd.

03:26.998 --> 03:31.293
With the very first dose, starts to work on
the DNA, slowing the metabolism...

03:31.461 --> 03:34.254
...causing weight gain
and inapting their emotional range...

03:34.422 --> 03:36.340
...which makes them perfectly complacent.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.968
We gone up against plenty, liked to eat a
few folk in the woods. This ain't that.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.763
This is about knocking us
off the top of the food chain.

03:42.931 --> 03:46.308
This is about them Levis
living here forever, one-percenter style...

03:46.643 --> 03:48.560
...while we march our dopey, fat asses...

03:48.728 --> 03:51.188
...down to the shiny new death camps
at every corner.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.080
It's an e-mail...

04:09.249 --> 04:10.499
...from Frank.

04:10.667 --> 04:14.127
- Frank's alive?
- That jackass, always stealing my thunder.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.589
"Sam and Dean, if you're reading this,
I'm dead.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.678
Or worse.

04:22.845 --> 04:26.139
This e-mail was sent because some prince
is trying to hack into my hard drive...

04:26.307 --> 04:29.059
...right this second.
So unless it's you, you got trouble.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.778
Um, ahem. Okay. My drive is full of
compromising info. Your new aliases...

04:39.946 --> 04:44.116
...hangouts, where you stored your car..."
Baby?

04:44.284 --> 04:47.494
Even though he encrypted his drive,
he says we should assume...

04:47.662 --> 04:49.788
...that someone
can hack into it eventually.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.623
He did put a tracking device in it.

04:54.002 --> 04:57.379
All right, let's see
where Frank's drive is.

05:01.718 --> 05:02.801
Perfect.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.929
It's in the middle of the Death Star.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.365
How'd it go last night?

06:49.575 --> 06:53.078
Charlie. It's a moral imperative you let me
live vicariously through you.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.163
Pictures or it didn't happen, right?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.047
You hooked up at a charity benefit?

07:04.215 --> 07:08.718
If you can't score at a reproductive rights
function, then you simply cannot score.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.137
Wait, is that legal?

07:10.346 --> 07:12.347
We were two consenting adults.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.224
No. That.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.146
Why do you insist on breaking the law
on company property?

07:19.313 --> 07:22.899
- Hmm, faster internet connection here.
- If Pete finds out, he's gonna fire you.

07:23.067 --> 07:26.069
- Or get you arrested.
- Teddy Bear Pete? Please.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.699
You know I've been doing this for, like,
a month. I can cover my tracks, Harry.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.492
- Trust me.
- Charlie.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.164
My office. Now.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.750
- I love you.
- I know.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.511
Charlie Bradbury.

07:51.679 --> 07:52.762
Dick.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.514
Sit.

08:02.190 --> 08:07.861
Charlie, I've been running things for, well,
feels like since before the dawn of man.

08:08.696 --> 08:09.988
I always had a vision.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.116
And I'm close to realizing that dream.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.036
I don't wanna brag, but the world
is my dinner plate.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.039
I don't want anything to jeopardize that.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.292
Definitely not the actions of one
tiny little person.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.921
Sir, I can fix this. Please don't fire me.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.756
- What's she talking about?
- Uh...

08:27.924 --> 08:30.425
Is that about hacking those Super PACs?

08:32.094 --> 08:34.054
Because that was adorable.

08:34.304 --> 08:38.350
How does a high school dropout become
one of the brightest minds at Roman, Inc?

08:38.518 --> 08:39.768
Um...

08:40.311 --> 08:44.898
Honestly? Historically, I've had
this problem with authority, no offense...

08:45.066 --> 08:48.818
...so I realized that the only way
I could get away with being me was to be...

08:49.070 --> 08:51.655
...as indispensable as possible.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.158
Sorry.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.995
You're kind of
completing me right now, Charlie.

09:00.206 --> 09:04.459
You have that spark.
That thing that makes humans so special.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.461
Not everyone has it, you know.

09:06.671 --> 09:11.675
Those people, they can be replaced.
But people like you are impossible to copy.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.928
- Copy?
- Take the compliment.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.140
This belonged to one Frank Devereaux.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.811
Thought he could bring down
the whole company. He was wrong.

09:23.145 --> 09:27.399
Let's keep him wrong. It's encrypted,
or whatever you crazy kids say these days.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.027
- Break it open and bring it to me.
- Yeah, I'm on it. And thank you.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.612
You're welcome.

09:33.030 --> 09:35.156
You have three days or you're fired.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.992
Good talk.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.248
Is this real life?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.333
Uh...

09:45.876 --> 09:48.211
Dick Roman gave me an assignment.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.046
Is that... good?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.799
It means the eye of Sauron is on me.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.761
Well, if you need anything,
I'll be back in the Shire.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.478
All right, H. It's just you and me now.

10:31.505 --> 10:35.925
How about a nice game of chess?

10:39.805 --> 10:40.972
Wait a second.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.434
Seriously? WarGames?

10:49.106 --> 10:51.149
Shall we play a game, bitches?

10:51.776 --> 10:54.444
That was hardly
the Chamber of Secrets, right? Booya.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.240
Shall we play a game?

11:00.409 --> 11:03.119
Nice try, Zero Charisma.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.956
And back to square one.

11:07.124 --> 11:09.209
Let's see where Frank's drive is.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.712
Perfect.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.131
It's in the middle of the Death Star.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.219
All right, well, off to Chicago.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.599
No, wait, boys. You can't just break in.
They know your mugs.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.688
What if we mailed in the flask?
Then I could ghost through the joint.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.023
It's not like Dick can kill me twice.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.609
What, you got a better plan?

11:37.113 --> 11:41.574
Come on. Just because I'm dead, doesn't
mean I don't know how to do my damn job.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.869
Bobby, that's Dick's office.

11:46.789 --> 11:50.917
I think what Sam is trying to say is,
what happens if you run into Dick and...

11:51.836 --> 11:54.629
You know, go vengeful.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.340
You know that's not something you can
just shake off.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.758
Come on. Give me some credit.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.596
What, I'm supposed to just ride the pine?

12:04.348 --> 12:05.390
Sorry, Bobby.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.120
Did you go home last night?

12:28.748 --> 12:32.667
I'll get us some coffee.
I assume you want some crack in yours.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.128
Yes, please.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.218
Finally.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.478
Who is this d-bag?

12:54.982 --> 12:56.024
Don't do it.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.109
Roman said to bring it right to him.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.908
You're right, H. You're always right.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.588
What the frak's a Leviathan?

13:19.465 --> 13:23.885
The thing to know about Leviathan
is these monsters are as old as time...

13:24.053 --> 13:25.470
...strong as all get-out...

13:25.638 --> 13:30.308
sodium borate, commonly known
as Borax. Splash liberally...

13:30.476 --> 13:32.769
decapitation is key.
And put that head in a box...

13:32.937 --> 13:34.395
the superman of monsters...

13:34.563 --> 13:37.232
don't use backup.
Send it to the moon if you can...

13:37.399 --> 13:39.692
If they die, they don't die easy.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.236
Your memory, the works.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.780
Top boss is Mr. Dick Roman.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.156
He runs the show.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.959
Cut one, you see black goo.

13:56.126 --> 13:59.629
We're through the looking glass.
Blood is black and black is blood.

13:59.797 --> 14:03.591
Don't turn your back, get out
of the building, get out of the country.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.642
How goes it?

14:12.810 --> 14:16.938
Pretty sure I spent the last 24 hours
hacking into a loony bin. Where's Pete?

14:17.106 --> 14:20.275
Uh, probably snuck down to the garage
for a smoky treat.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.286
How's it going with that drive?

14:31.453 --> 14:34.664
Uh, great. Charlie was here all night.

14:34.874 --> 14:38.418
That drive's very important to me.
I'm gonna want a watchful eye kept.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.546
- Well, I will do just that.
- No. You won't.

14:43.424 --> 14:47.302
Bruce Springsteen. Eli Manning.
Our own little Charlie.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.304
You know what they are? Irreplaceable.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.141
You're more of a Tim Tebow,
Joe Biden type.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.102
You got no spark in you.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.438
In fact, there's nothing in you...

14:59.565 --> 15:00.773
...except Daryl's dinner.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.513
Hey, Pete.
Sorry I left without telling you.

15:33.098 --> 15:37.644
No, I just wasn't feeling well.
It's a... lady thing.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.270
I will be in first thing.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.855
Gotta go, cramps.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.204
- It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Get away from me, you...

15:56.747 --> 15:58.957
- Shapeshifter!
- We're not shapeshifters.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.376
Jeez.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.465
We're not Leviathans. Okay?
You want us to prove it?

16:07.633 --> 16:10.093
- You know what Borax does to them?
- Yeah.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.803
Sam?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.057
Huh?

16:16.225 --> 16:17.475
Your turn.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.312
Good.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.774
Who the hell are you guys?

16:27.486 --> 16:30.863
America, a nation of greatness.

16:33.075 --> 16:36.411
A nation of hard-working individuals.

16:36.620 --> 16:41.374
And rest assured, no one works harder
for you than SUCROCORP.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.167
Here at SUCROCORP...

16:43.669 --> 16:47.630
...your well-being is our
number one priority.

16:51.969 --> 16:56.389
SUCROCORP. Eat well, live well.

17:00.310 --> 17:03.771
So you're saying
you guys are monster hunters?

17:03.939 --> 17:06.482
So there are other monsters?

17:06.942 --> 17:08.526
Stop. Never mind. Just...

17:09.486 --> 17:14.656
Okay, I get how you tracked the drive.
Straight GPS. But it's still at the office.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.576
How did you find me?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.917
Ugh. Son of a gun jacked my webcam?

17:26.086 --> 17:27.127
Welcome to Frank.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.881
That's creepy, but I'll give it to him.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.093
So you're telling me
everything he had on his drive is true?

17:34.762 --> 17:36.846
- That and more.
- Wait.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.599
How long did it take you
to crack into Frank's drive?

17:39.767 --> 17:41.059
A day or so.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.978
- Is there anything you can't hack into?
- Not yet.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.939
- How about Dick Roman's e-mail?
- Why would I...?

17:47.816 --> 17:51.027
- Oh, he's one of them.
- No. Uh, he's their leader.

17:52.279 --> 17:55.364
So what's the endgame?
Steal our resources, make us his slaves?

17:55.532 --> 17:57.408
Planet-wide Value Meal. We're the meat.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.745
Heh. You can't be... serious.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.626
Okay. All right. Let's do this.
What am I looking for?

18:07.711 --> 18:10.922
Well, for starters, uh,
anything about archaeological dig sites.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.465
Like Indiana Jones stuff?

18:12.633 --> 18:15.009
All we know is that Dick's
been digging all over the world...

18:15.177 --> 18:16.928
...and we need to know
what he's looking for.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.305
You know, I was having a really good week.
I met someone.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.517
Downloaded the new Robyn album.
Everything was coming up me.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.187
- Oh, crap.
- Look. We get it sucks...

18:26.355 --> 18:30.024
No, not that. This.
Dick's e-mail isn't on the company server.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.485
- It's on a private one. In his office.
- Meaning?

18:32.653 --> 18:35.321
You can't get in it unless you have
his phone or you're at his desk.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.406
So if we're inside Dick's office...

18:37.574 --> 18:40.284
...we can hack into his e-mail?
You can't. Only someone like...

18:44.331 --> 18:47.875
But I sure as hell ain't doing it.
I am doing my job and...

18:49.169 --> 18:53.256
What are the chances I see everything on
that drive and Dick lets me live anyway?

18:53.715 --> 18:54.799
I think you know.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.636
So I erase the drive first.

18:59.054 --> 19:02.098
Protect me and you,
then I go back to my old life. Right?

19:04.017 --> 19:05.476
- What?
- It's not that easy.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.897
You're on Dick's radar, which means
you don't have an old life anymore.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.733
I'm gonna die.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.320
I should've taken that job at Google.

19:17.489 --> 19:23.536
Look, Charlie. It's okay if you can't do
it. I mean, you didn't volunteer for this.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.414
Totally. Exactly.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.375
But now I volunteer.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.880
- What?
- I gotta go back in anyways...

19:34.047 --> 19:37.550
...to wipe Frank's drive.
Might as well break into Dick's office too.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.636
Are you sure?

19:40.929 --> 19:43.931
No. But these things are gonna eat
everyone I know.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.850
What kind of douche bag
stands by for that?

19:46.518 --> 19:52.273
However, I've never broken into anything
in real life before. So plan?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.318
- You got a Bluetooth?
- Yeah.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.445
Security system, can you get into that?

19:57.613 --> 19:59.822
I can reroute any surveillance cameras
we need.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.157
Let's start with that.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.367
Do you have a keycard
to get into the building?

20:03.535 --> 20:07.079
Uh, yeah, I can't duplicate it,
but I can make a fake tag...

20:15.464 --> 20:19.050
- How's it going?
- Great, since she set all this up.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.468
Um, look. Ahem.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.223
See this? I can put each camera
on a prerecorded loop.

20:25.557 --> 20:29.477
- Once I do that, she'll have 15 minutes.
- Fifteen minutes ain't a lot of time.

20:29.645 --> 20:33.314
She said if it took longer to hack his
desktop then she deserved to be eaten.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.774
I like her.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.818
Wait, is that?

20:39.863 --> 20:41.155
Son of a bitch.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.990
- What?
- Look at her bag.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.081
Bobby. You think he, uh...

20:50.290 --> 20:52.917
Hitched a ride after we told him to
cool his jets? Yeah.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.294
- What the hell is he thinking?
- He's not.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.507
- Do we call it off?
- We only got one shot at this.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.180
Charlie, it's Dean, are you singing?

21:06.348 --> 21:09.809
- I sing when I'm nervous. Don't judge me!
- Judgment-free zone.

21:10.018 --> 21:13.062
Listen, uh, check the side pocket
in your bag.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.231
Oh.

21:16.608 --> 21:17.984
Thank you.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.863
- Mm. Good idea.
- Yeah, no problem.

21:23.365 --> 21:28.202
Look, that's, uh, kind of family heirloom.
It's a good-luck charm. So don't lose it.

21:28.787 --> 21:29.870
Copy that.

21:30.789 --> 21:31.914
Okay.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.417
Let's do this.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.381
Uh, Charlie?

21:42.634 --> 21:44.802
- Uh, Charlie?
- I'm having a hard time moving.

21:45.679 --> 21:46.804
You can do this.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.556
Uh, I'm not a spy.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.474
I can't do it. I can't do it.
I can't do it.

21:50.767 --> 21:54.186
- Charlie, hey, it's Sam.
- I'm sorry, Sam, I just...

21:54.354 --> 21:58.024
It's okay, uh, listen, who's your favorite
Harry Potter character?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.696
Uh, Hermione.

22:04.531 --> 22:09.660
Hermione. Well, uh, did Hermione run
when Sirius Black was in trouble?

22:09.828 --> 22:12.163
- Or when Voldemort attacked Hogwarts?
- Seriously?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.999
- Shut up.
- No. Of course not.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.917
What did she do?

22:17.377 --> 22:19.253
She kicked ass.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.631
She actually saves Harry
in practically every book...

22:22.841 --> 22:26.594
...then she ends up with the wrong...
Uh, stay on track. She kicked ass, right?

22:26.762 --> 22:28.220
So, what are you gonna do?

22:30.390 --> 22:34.352
- I'm gonna kick it in the ass.
- Heh. Good girl.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.646
You go, Dumbledork.

23:34.621 --> 23:37.206
I'm in. I've always wanted to say that.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.127
You're on the clock. Move.

23:53.932 --> 23:58.769
Hey. There's a big-ass guard up here
blocking the door. What do I do?

23:58.937 --> 24:00.604
Just wait him out.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.235
He's not going anywhere.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.073
Okay. Uh, you work there every day.
Do you know the guy?

24:11.241 --> 24:13.451
I guess. I've seen him,
I never talked to him.

24:13.618 --> 24:17.997
Okay, when you see him does he look
at you, or just kind of slide his eyes by?

24:18.165 --> 24:19.540
Um...

24:19.708 --> 24:24.170
Eye contact? I don't know, he always
kind of smiles a bit. I don't really...

24:24.337 --> 24:26.213
Good. You're gonna walk up to him...

24:26.756 --> 24:28.424
...and flirt your way past.

24:30.051 --> 24:32.595
I can't. He's not my type.

24:33.430 --> 24:36.765
- You gotta play through that.
- As in he's not a girl.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.103
Oh. Oh.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.064
Pretend he has boobs.

24:45.567 --> 24:49.361
- Worse.
- I don't know, uh...

24:49.613 --> 24:52.448
...do you have any tattoos?
Give him a sneak peek there.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.200
All tattoos are sexy.

24:54.409 --> 24:57.620
Mine is Princess Leia in a slave bikini,
straddling a twenty-sided die.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.499
I was drunk. It was Comic-Con.

25:03.376 --> 25:06.295
We've all been there.
Okay, I'm gonna walk you through this.

25:12.677 --> 25:15.054
Let's start with a smile. Relax.

25:15.305 --> 25:19.058
Charlie, you just got home,
and Scarlett Johansson is waiting for you.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.267
Oh.

25:22.145 --> 25:25.689
- Can I help you, miss?
- Hey, Bill.

25:25.899 --> 25:29.318
- Charlie from IT.
- Oh. Burning the midnight oil, huh?

25:29.653 --> 25:33.781
Just like you.
I mean, when you're not at the gym.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.866
Do you work out with all your free time?

25:36.034 --> 25:40.871
Heh. I try to hit the gym at least three days
a week. To get back to my fighting weight.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.998
It shows. You look amazing.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.876
- It shows, you look amazing.
- This never happened.

25:46.628 --> 25:49.922
Do anything else with your free time?
Like take a girl for a drink?

25:50.090 --> 25:51.924
Do anything else with your free time?
Like...

25:52.092 --> 25:55.553
Stop laughing, Sammy.

25:57.097 --> 26:00.015
Um, you don't know that bar?
Stop Laughing, Sammy?

26:00.183 --> 26:02.142
That place is bringing sexy back.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.103
Stop talking, Charlie.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.981
Stop talking, Charlie. Right. So, um...

26:07.148 --> 26:11.402
...you were saying,
about going out, drinks?

26:12.862 --> 26:17.241
- Um, yeah, that would be great.
- Cool.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.910
Pencil that in. Hey, can I ask a favor?

26:20.120 --> 26:22.371
The ladies room downstairs is nasty.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.374
Can I use the Exec Washroom
to powder my nose?

26:27.544 --> 26:32.131
Yeah. Why not? Um, right down the hall,
first door on the right.

26:41.850 --> 26:44.768
- I feel dirty.
- You and me both, sister.

26:46.646 --> 26:50.858
- The eagle is landing. Going radio silent.
- Let us know when you're out.

26:53.153 --> 26:56.655
- So I guess we just wait?
- Yeah.

27:14.257 --> 27:18.677
Your password is "winning,"
with two ones? Fail.

27:48.541 --> 27:51.752
Okay, let's Yoda this.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.738
- Hey, you!
- What are you doing in here?

28:20.031 --> 28:23.075
- You said first door on the left, right?
- No, I said first door on the right.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.203
Oh. Silly me,
I'm always forgetting things.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.581
Do you know what else I forgot to do?

28:34.129 --> 28:35.963
Give you my phone number.

28:36.715 --> 28:40.592
Uh, we really shouldn't be in here, Mr.
Roman doesn't like people in his office.

28:40.802 --> 28:43.679
I'm sure. Have you seen his bathroom?

28:46.850 --> 28:49.852
Gotta go, call me.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.822
This is awesome.
You know what, new plan.

29:01.990 --> 29:05.701
From now on, we stay in the van
and send in the 90-pound girl.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.704
Dean, every Chomper on Earth
knows our face.

29:08.872 --> 29:13.292
How many you think are in that building?
We wouldn't make it past the lobby.

29:15.628 --> 29:19.631
I know. Doesn't mean I gotta be happy
about sending in fricking Veronica Mars.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.051
She'll be fine.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.138
Or we'll go in.

29:27.432 --> 29:30.434
And get as far as we can. Damn right.

29:49.829 --> 29:52.623
- Hey, guys?
- Hey.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.417
Sending you all the flagged dig files now.

29:56.669 --> 30:00.380
- Charlie, you're a genius!
- I know. It's a problem.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.137
Damn it.

30:07.388 --> 30:10.349
Hey, Pete!
Guess we're both on deadline, huh?

30:10.558 --> 30:11.725
How's it going?

30:11.893 --> 30:15.145
Good, good, I'll give you a full
progress report in a few hours.

30:15.355 --> 30:19.233
Great. Hit that deadline, right?

30:21.611 --> 30:23.529
Well, holler if you need anything.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.247
- Hey, guys? Still there?
- Yeah, the hell was that?

30:33.581 --> 30:36.083
Oh, just my manager, the monster.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.794
- Leave.
- I can't. I gotta act normal.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.505
I told him I was working.
Let's just finish this.

30:44.384 --> 30:47.845
- Hey, are you seeing this?
- Looks like Dick stopped digging days ago.

30:48.763 --> 30:51.390
- Why?
- Guess he found what he was looking for.

30:51.724 --> 30:53.433
- Can you check...?
- Way ahead of you.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.395
Looking at travel reports, expenses...

30:57.522 --> 31:01.817
Here we go. Something in a suitcase
left Iran last week.

31:01.985 --> 31:05.070
Spent the last 72 hours
in armored cars and private planes.

31:06.990 --> 31:10.534
Whatever it is, it's coming here.
For Dick. Tonight.

31:11.035 --> 31:14.705
- So, what the hell is it?
- Whatever it is, he wants it bad.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.665
We gotta grab it. End of story.

31:16.833 --> 31:20.752
Well, it's landing at a private airport
near here. Crap. Right about now.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.462
A courier's set to pick it up.

31:22.630 --> 31:25.007
- Landing time?
- Forty-two minutes. Can you make it?

31:26.843 --> 31:30.053
We can try. Uh, all right, Charlie,
one more favor then get out of there.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.055
Outstanding.

31:32.724 --> 31:36.143
- You'll call when the package is in hand?
- Absolutely.

31:36.436 --> 31:38.061
I'm here, waiting.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.981
In fact, I've got time for a light snack.

31:54.370 --> 31:55.495
Hey, Charlie.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.582
I was hoping I'd find you here.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.810
- Hey, watch it.
- Sorry.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.541
So now what?

32:45.880 --> 32:49.758
I've been looking for this a very,
very long time.

32:58.267 --> 33:00.519
Now who could've done that?

33:01.396 --> 33:04.022
- A courier's set to pick it up.
- Landing time?

33:04.190 --> 33:06.733
- Forty-two minutes. Can you make it?
- We can try.

33:06.901 --> 33:09.903
- Uh, one more favor then get out of there.
- What do you need?

33:10.113 --> 33:11.405
More time.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.408
Then let's get you some.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.077
Travel department's e-mailing Dick.

33:17.245 --> 33:21.373
"Suitcase still en route, but diverted by
weather and will be 30 minutes late."

33:34.762 --> 33:37.889
I'll mop you off the drive,
and get the hell out of Dodge.

33:38.391 --> 33:41.518
- Call us when you're clear.
- I'll text you from the border, bro.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.984
- Hey, watch it.
- Sorry.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.780
Hey, watch it.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.014
Hey, Charlie.
I was hoping I'd find you here.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.641
- Um, hey, Mr. Roman.
- Please...

34:23.311 --> 34:24.393
...Dick.

34:25.980 --> 34:29.399
Pete, we're good here.
Why don't you go grab a bite?

34:34.655 --> 34:36.697
Show me what you've found.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.165
- So now what?
- See what we've won.

34:52.340 --> 34:56.676
- Did we just steal a hunk of red clay?
- That's a good question.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.554
We'll answer that a few thousand
miles from here.

34:59.722 --> 35:01.098
Where's Charlie?

35:06.062 --> 35:08.647
So there's nothing about my company?

35:09.190 --> 35:12.234
Oh. What about a Sam or a Dean?

35:12.860 --> 35:14.861
- I'm sorry, who?
- Sam and Dean Winchester.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.780
Give it a little peek, would you?

35:18.741 --> 35:19.866
Dick Roman.

35:22.537 --> 35:25.664
Come on. The girl's right there.

35:25.832 --> 35:26.873
Worry about her.

35:27.083 --> 35:30.168
Is it me,
or did it just drop ten degrees in here?

35:30.711 --> 35:33.380
- Bit nippy, yeah.
- I'll have maintenance check the a.c.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.215
I can't have you cold, now, can I?

35:36.551 --> 35:38.593
You miserable...

35:39.554 --> 35:41.680
Damn it, Bobby. Come on...

35:44.684 --> 35:46.393
Nothing about those Winchesters.

35:46.561 --> 35:50.438
If items were deleted from the drive,
would you be able to tell?

35:50.690 --> 35:54.067
Not if they were deleted properly.

35:56.404 --> 35:57.904
When they're crafty.

35:58.906 --> 36:00.824
- Have all the data sent to me.
- Of course.

36:03.828 --> 36:07.622
- So, really, how did you do it?
- Um, do what?

36:07.957 --> 36:11.626
You broke the unbreakable. What's the
thought process? Walk me through it...

36:11.794 --> 36:13.420
...and ixnay the jargon.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.963
Um...

36:15.423 --> 36:17.507
Nothing's unbreakable, really.

36:18.092 --> 36:20.135
Nothing's safe
if you poke at it long enough.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.845
"Nothing's safe." I like that.

36:22.930 --> 36:25.724
But that isn't what I'm asking, Charlie.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.268
Your spark, it's one in a million.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.854
Believe me, but when you got it
you invent...

36:31.272 --> 36:36.526
...guns and iPads and viruses and
you can be crafty. What is that, Charlie?

36:37.028 --> 36:39.696
I could feed every fact in your brain
to someone else...

36:39.864 --> 36:42.115
...they still wouldn't be able to be you.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.159
I guess you can't clone me.

36:44.785 --> 36:46.828
Don't think that doesn't piss me off.

36:52.501 --> 36:53.752
Yes?

36:54.629 --> 36:57.214
Fantastic. Bring it to my office,
I'll be right there.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.552
I think we're on to something here.
Stay here, will you?

37:02.845 --> 37:05.138
Be back in two shakes.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.540
"Nothing is safe," apparently.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.293
Lock the building down. Now.

37:54.188 --> 37:55.855
Hold on there, Charlie.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.872
Dean! He's one of them!

38:20.089 --> 38:23.383
That would explain it.
Hanging with the wrong crowd, kiddo.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.931
Not so fast, Dick.

38:38.691 --> 38:42.902
All right, enough, show yourself.

38:43.070 --> 38:45.405
Let's do this like real monsters.

38:50.536 --> 38:53.204
You gotta do that again, that tickles.

38:53.372 --> 38:55.498
Dean, come on, come on.

39:02.256 --> 39:05.008
- Charlie, talk to us. You okay?
- No.

39:05.634 --> 39:08.178
- Why didn't you kill him?
- We can't yet.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.597
But we will.

39:10.848 --> 39:13.600
The really evil ones always need
a special sword.

39:14.477 --> 39:18.521
Oh. Okay. I'm gonna pass out now.

39:24.737 --> 39:27.697
Because they have it! Now get it back!

39:27.865 --> 39:31.785
- Before they figure the damn thing out!
- Please, sir. Don't bib me.

39:32.078 --> 39:35.914
Bib you?
Why would I waste a perfectly good meal?

39:46.384 --> 39:48.259
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

39:48.552 --> 39:51.304
I left your dumb flask
on the back seat, by the way.

39:51.472 --> 39:54.015
Worst good-luck charm ever.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.309
- There you go.
- Thanks.

39:56.477 --> 40:01.439
- So listen, um, we can't thank you enough.
- Actually, you can.

40:01.857 --> 40:04.692
Never contact me again. Like, ever. Deal?

40:06.112 --> 40:07.570
Deal. Heh.

40:08.864 --> 40:12.742
- You keep your head down out there.
- This ain't the first time I've disappeared.

40:15.204 --> 40:18.873
You think my name is really
Charlie Bradbury? Please.

40:19.083 --> 40:22.252
So good luck saving the world.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.296
Peace out, bitches.

40:28.175 --> 40:30.176
She's kind of like the little sister
I never wanted.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.305
We gotta talk.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.684
You mean before we get back to the car,
and the flask?

40:37.893 --> 40:39.060
Exactly.

40:39.228 --> 40:43.022
- So, what happened in the lobby, Dean?
- Man, if I'd had a free shot...

40:43.190 --> 40:45.024
...I'd have bitch-slapped
the hell out of Dick.

40:45.192 --> 40:48.778
Yeah, but, I mean,
Charlie got her arm broken.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.780
- He didn't mean to do it.
- Exactly.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.866
He's not in control. Not about Dick.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.910
- That was vengeful-spirit crap.
- I know.

40:56.162 --> 40:59.998
- But it's still Bobby.
- But if he goes there he won't be anymore.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.083
And we won't be able to pull him back.

41:02.251 --> 41:04.794
- And then what are we supposed to do?
- I know.

41:08.090 --> 41:10.467
Let's just figure out
what that thing we stole is.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.427
Then figure out what to do with Bobby.
