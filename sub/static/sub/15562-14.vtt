WEBVTT

00:03.008 --> 00:04.843
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers.

00:04.844 --> 00:07.484
We do apologise for the
heat in the store today.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.757
The temperature is
controlled by corporate,

00:09.867 --> 00:11.234
and we are working on it.

00:11.268 --> 00:12.666
And though I am thankful

00:12.666 --> 00:14.934
for all of you who have taken
the time to tell me

00:14.968 --> 00:16.802
that it is hot in here,

00:16.837 --> 00:18.304
the next person who does,

00:18.338 --> 00:19.772
I'ma have to murder.

00:21.341 --> 00:23.275
That is all.

00:23.623 --> 00:25.323
How about you cool it with the attitude?

00:25.358 --> 00:26.992
- Not today, Dina.
- What, you think you're

00:27.026 --> 00:27.993
the only person that's uncomfortable?

00:28.027 --> 00:30.262
My pelvic area is like
the Gulf Coast right now.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.368
Seriously, I could steam
shellfish in these khakis.

00:32.369 --> 00:33.170
- Good God.
- If you can't

00:33.204 --> 00:34.905
be professional, stay off the airwaves.

00:34.939 --> 00:36.540
Whoa, keep your hands
off Thor's hammer. Come on.

00:36.574 --> 00:37.675
No, it's... no, absolutely not.

00:37.709 --> 00:38.742
- It's mine now.
- Oh, yeah?

00:38.777 --> 00:39.743
- How about it?
- Boom.

00:39.778 --> 00:40.944
What about that? Round two.

00:40.979 --> 00:41.779
Is that your own personal microphone?

00:41.813 --> 00:43.180
Yeah. I carry this one with me.

00:43.214 --> 00:44.081
Guys. Guys, come on.

00:44.122 --> 00:46.763
I know it's hot in here,
but let's breathe.

00:46.771 --> 00:49.139
Let's have some patience
for one another.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.976
Yeah, you know, the heat makes us all

00:52.010 --> 00:53.177
act irrationally, you know, I mean...

00:53.211 --> 00:55.920
If your face stays where
it is, it's gonna get punched.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.716
- I was just saying...
- Punched.

01:01.504 --> 01:04.736
- Synced and corrected by hawken45 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:11.930 --> 01:14.537
God, the heat really brings
out your age, doesn't it?

01:14.866 --> 01:17.167
Dina, I am trying to keep
a positive attitude today,

01:17.202 --> 01:18.268
so help me out, okay?

01:18.303 --> 01:20.537
Yeah, sure. Sorry.

01:24.242 --> 01:27.678
So did you eat a lot
of French onion soup last night,

01:27.712 --> 01:30.415
or is that just the natural
scent your body secretes?

01:31.049 --> 01:32.750
You just have a very unique musk.

01:32.784 --> 01:34.918
It's thick. It's, like, swampy.

01:34.953 --> 01:36.587
- Okay.
- It's like a swampy musk.

01:36.621 --> 01:38.722
- I'm walking away. Bye.
- It's not bad.

01:38.757 --> 01:40.257
What? No offense.

01:40.291 --> 01:41.725
Yeah, so anyway,

01:41.760 --> 01:44.528
the heat's really
blasting away over here,

01:44.562 --> 01:46.530
and since you guys set the temperatures,

01:46.564 --> 01:48.265
I was hoping you could turn it off.

01:48.299 --> 01:50.245
No problem. I can help you with that.

01:50.511 --> 01:54.514
- Thank you.
- And my computer says

01:54.549 --> 01:57.017
you're at 66 degrees, so that's perfect.

01:57.051 --> 01:57.851
Well... well, no.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.053
Maybe your computer's not working,

02:00.087 --> 02:04.524
'cause I can assure you it is
extremely warm in the store.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.426
Mm-hmm, yeah. In my experience,

02:06.460 --> 02:08.061
computers don't make the mistakes.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.062
People do.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.597
I'm just gonna put a note on here

02:10.631 --> 02:11.698
that says "manager error."

02:11.732 --> 02:12.933
It is not an error.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.100
I know what hot is,

02:14.135 --> 02:16.002
and I am very, very hot.

02:16.037 --> 02:18.438
I'm sure you are. Please hold.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.028
What...

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.117 --> 02:33.019
Marcus, what do you know
about this pallet?

02:33.933 --> 02:36.056
Are you asking 'cause I'm
in charge of the warehouse now?

02:36.090 --> 02:38.959
'Cause you heard I'm in charge
of the warehouse now, right?

02:39.305 --> 02:40.760
I did. Yeah.

02:40.795 --> 02:42.963
A promotion with no raise. Well done.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.531
Thank you. It just goes to show

02:44.565 --> 02:46.933
you keep your head down,
you do the work,

02:46.968 --> 02:50.070
get your thumb cut off,
and agree not to sue,

02:50.104 --> 02:51.348
anything can happen.

02:52.073 --> 02:54.230
Okay. So you can clean this up?

02:54.734 --> 02:56.484
I got a lot on my plate right now,

02:56.586 --> 02:59.337
uh, but sure, yeah,
I'll take care of it.

02:59.981 --> 03:01.226
You know what they say:

03:01.288 --> 03:03.523
heavy is the head that wears the pants.

03:03.557 --> 03:04.591
Okay.

03:04.625 --> 03:06.593
It's Shakespeare.

03:06.627 --> 03:08.899
Maybe pick up a book once in a while.

03:10.731 --> 03:13.374
Hey, Glenn, I just wanted
to check on the ETA of...

03:14.401 --> 03:17.337
Ooh, it is pleasant as hell in here.

03:17.883 --> 03:19.939
Well, yeah, I had to turn on the AC...

03:19.974 --> 03:21.508
in February!

03:21.542 --> 03:22.942
Can you believe that?

03:22.977 --> 03:24.344
I'm trying to get them to fix it,

03:24.378 --> 03:26.045
but, my God, these people!

03:26.594 --> 03:29.015
So while everybody's
out there boiling in the heat,

03:29.368 --> 03:32.002
you just sitting in here
in your ivory ice tower?

03:32.143 --> 03:33.686
I'm doing everything I can.

03:33.991 --> 03:34.773
Are you?

03:35.329 --> 03:37.512
'Cause your people are counting on you.

03:37.514 --> 03:40.353
So maybe this isn't
about asking for help.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.537
Maybe this is about...

03:44.865 --> 03:46.699
11:35?

03:46.734 --> 03:49.569
- Keep guessing.
- It's about...

03:49.603 --> 03:52.872
time I fixed the heat myself?

03:52.907 --> 03:55.186
Okay, I can work with that. Yes, Glenn.

03:55.188 --> 03:59.679
Get out there and fix
that heating system or whatever.

03:59.713 --> 04:01.981
Yeah, I can.
I... I'm gonna fix it myself.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.484
Yeah. That's what I'm doing.

04:04.518 --> 04:05.919
- Okay.
- Doing that right now.

04:05.953 --> 04:08.755
Yeah, go fix it. And take your time!

04:08.789 --> 04:10.040
It's about the journey!

04:11.231 --> 04:13.393
Ooh, max cool.

04:13.745 --> 04:15.163
That's what I'm all about.

04:18.029 --> 04:19.998
Ugh, can you stay on your side?

04:20.099 --> 04:22.000
You're getting your gross
guy heat all over me.

04:22.036 --> 04:24.437
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this better? Is this helping?

04:24.471 --> 04:25.672
- No!
- You like that?

04:25.706 --> 04:28.508
It's worse! It's grosser!

04:28.534 --> 04:30.335
Oh, my God, you are such a drama queen.

04:30.376 --> 04:31.780
You're disgusting.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.913
I am really sorry.

04:33.948 --> 04:35.915
I just thought leather pants
would look cool.

04:35.950 --> 04:37.917
I didn't realize they'd stick
to sweaty legs.

04:37.959 --> 04:41.057
It's fine. It's not real leather anyway.

04:41.112 --> 04:43.857
It's made out of recycled soda bottles.

04:43.891 --> 04:46.593
I'm going to this mixer
for single IT guys.

04:46.627 --> 04:48.962
Yeah? You gonna meet some women?

04:48.996 --> 04:51.598
No. Just other IT guys.

04:51.632 --> 04:53.766
Well, they're gonna love these pants.

04:53.801 --> 04:54.901
Uh, hey, Amy?

04:55.159 --> 04:58.539
This woman slipped on some
yogurt in Grocery, and, uh...

04:58.572 --> 05:01.040
No! No... Marcus was su...

05:01.518 --> 05:03.544
Okay, um, I'll be right back.

05:03.577 --> 05:04.711
Just wait here, ma'am.

05:04.745 --> 05:05.551
Here you are.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.630
I'm in IT.

05:13.854 --> 05:18.725
Ooh! Ahhh!

05:21.318 --> 05:23.530
Oh, shut the door.
You're letting the air out.

05:24.359 --> 05:25.598
Are you Glenn?

05:25.633 --> 05:28.902
'Cause this is Glenn's office,
but you don't look like Glenn.

05:28.936 --> 05:30.637
Unless Glenn completely changed

05:30.671 --> 05:32.072
everything about the way he looks,

05:32.073 --> 05:34.748
or Glenn's actually
always looked like Garrett

05:34.748 --> 05:36.944
but has just been wearing
a mask all these years.

05:36.977 --> 05:38.745
I'll get to the point.
I know you're not Glenn.

05:38.779 --> 05:40.580
Wow. Well, you figured that one out.

05:40.817 --> 05:43.111
Look, I'm just taking a
break from the heat.

05:43.817 --> 05:46.119
Yeah, it is a lot cooler in here.

05:46.845 --> 05:49.589
I mean, a gal could dry her pants out
all the way in a place like this.

05:50.958 --> 05:53.860
Marcus, a customer
just slipped on the spill.

05:53.894 --> 05:55.495
Yeah, sorry, Ames. We'll get to it.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.764
We're all just pretty hot back here.

05:57.798 --> 05:59.999
Yeah, no, I get it. It's hot everywhere.

06:00.034 --> 06:01.768
But you said you'd clean it up.

06:02.305 --> 06:03.603
Okay. Relax.

06:03.637 --> 06:04.938
There's no need to get emotional.

06:05.542 --> 06:07.941
Emotional? Am I...
am I getting emotional?

06:08.315 --> 06:09.121
Kind of?

06:09.510 --> 06:12.011
Okay, you know what?
It's not a big deal.

06:12.046 --> 06:15.014
Just needs to get cleaned up.
I'll have one of my guys do it.

06:15.049 --> 06:16.066
Much apreesh.

06:17.151 --> 06:18.952
Oh, and hey, Ames, smile.

06:18.986 --> 06:20.620
You'll live longer.

06:23.023 --> 06:24.980
Did you just tell me to smile?

06:25.782 --> 06:27.527
Yeah, you little sourpuss.

06:29.997 --> 06:31.505
Attention, employees.

06:31.765 --> 06:34.634
Do not clean up the yogurt spill
in Grocery.

06:34.668 --> 06:36.502
This is a warehouse problem,

06:36.537 --> 06:39.005
and it will be cleaned up
when they clean it up.

06:39.039 --> 06:40.974
Go to hell, Marcus.

06:41.593 --> 06:42.909
Excuse me. It's a little hot in here.

06:42.943 --> 06:44.783
We are aware of it!

06:45.913 --> 06:47.046
Okay.

06:48.015 --> 06:49.505
Have a heavenly day.

06:50.775 --> 06:52.241
I cannot believe he told me to smile.

06:52.276 --> 06:54.143
Yeah. That's so out of line.

06:54.178 --> 06:55.503
I completely agree.

06:55.504 --> 06:57.105
Would it help if I just cleaned it up?

06:57.139 --> 06:59.674
'Cause I really,
really want to clean it up.

06:59.708 --> 07:00.908
Like, really.

07:00.943 --> 07:03.478
Do not touch this spill.

07:03.512 --> 07:05.113
Okay, leaving it to fester.

07:05.147 --> 07:06.981
You know what? Maybe let's
just let this one go, you know?

07:07.016 --> 07:08.149
Because the... the heat.

07:08.641 --> 07:11.375
And also, maybe the heat is
causing, like, a number of us

07:11.376 --> 07:14.644
to act in ways that seem
a little, I don't know,

07:14.678 --> 07:16.212
uh, overboard.

07:16.247 --> 07:17.280
So what are you saying?

07:17.314 --> 07:18.948
We should let Marcus
off the hook because it's hot?

07:18.983 --> 07:21.317
No. No. No. It's just...

07:21.352 --> 07:26.831
remembering that all of us
are in the hot store, you know?

07:26.879 --> 07:29.612
Including me, Mateo, you.

07:31.216 --> 07:32.182
Yeah, I know,

07:32.241 --> 07:34.018
and we're staying cool
as [Bleep] cucumbers.

07:34.019 --> 07:35.585
- Okay.
- Mateo!

07:39.018 --> 07:40.740
What is wrong with people today?

07:42.393 --> 07:43.727
Whoa!

07:44.729 --> 07:46.369
What a view!

07:46.831 --> 07:49.399
Now I get why Brett's always
trying to make me come up here

07:49.434 --> 07:50.867
and smoke out with him.

07:50.902 --> 07:54.285
Yeah, well, this shouldn't take long.

07:54.402 --> 07:56.233
Your job is to hand me the tools

07:56.233 --> 07:58.671
as I need them, okay?

07:58.671 --> 08:00.105
Wow, you're so handy.

08:00.139 --> 08:01.973
It's "handsy." Plural.

08:02.008 --> 08:05.483
But yeah, the Sturgises
have always been builders.

08:05.624 --> 08:07.758
In fact, my ancestors built the ships

08:07.793 --> 08:10.595
that brought the very first
African-Americans

08:10.629 --> 08:12.597
to this country.

08:12.631 --> 08:14.732
You mean, like, slave ships?

08:14.766 --> 08:15.425
No!

08:17.183 --> 08:17.904
No.

08:20.806 --> 08:25.162
Uh, okay, well, let's see
what we're dealing with here.

08:28.981 --> 08:32.616
Whoa! I can't believe you know
how to fix that.

08:33.068 --> 08:35.231
Well, I definitely do,

08:35.787 --> 08:39.389
so why don't you just, uh,
be quiet and shut up?

08:45.464 --> 08:46.530
Do you have to make that noise?

08:46.981 --> 08:48.766
I've got a really bad itch
at the back of my throat.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.334
You know how they say people
swallow, on average,

08:50.369 --> 08:51.969
three spiders per year
while you're asleep?

08:52.570 --> 08:54.396
I think, last night, I hit my trifecta.

08:56.208 --> 08:56.960
Ugh.

09:05.517 --> 09:06.817
Yep, that pen still clicks.

09:06.852 --> 09:08.819
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I bugging you?

09:08.854 --> 09:10.788
Oh, it's not your fault.
You're just an annoying person.

09:10.822 --> 09:12.857
Look, let's be adults and just not talk.

09:12.891 --> 09:13.818
Fine with me.

09:25.504 --> 09:26.671
You remember that time we had sex?

09:26.705 --> 09:28.572
What the hell? Take off your pants.

09:30.475 --> 09:33.778
Thank you both for agreeing to sit down.

09:33.812 --> 09:35.146
Uh, mistakes were made.

09:35.595 --> 09:36.714
Some things were said

09:36.748 --> 09:38.883
that I'm sure both parties regret.

09:38.917 --> 09:41.018
She told me to go to hell. I'm Catholic.

09:41.053 --> 09:42.720
That's the worst place we can go.

09:42.754 --> 09:44.722
Well, at least I didn't
tell you to smile.

09:44.756 --> 09:46.724
What's wrong with that?
You have a nice smile.

09:46.758 --> 09:48.859
I have an amazing smile.
It lights up a room.

09:48.894 --> 09:50.995
But you don't tell me
when to smile, Marcus.

09:51.029 --> 09:54.398
I will smile when I damn well please.

09:54.433 --> 09:56.767
Fine. I'm sorry if you felt offended.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.670
I just forgot how sensitive
women can be.

09:59.705 --> 10:01.038
Marcus, no.

10:01.073 --> 10:02.557
So now I'm sensitive.

10:02.741 --> 10:04.819
Well, how's this for sensitive, Marcus?

10:04.859 --> 10:06.143
I am writing you up.

10:06.695 --> 10:09.480
Uh-oh, guys. Miss Amy's
writing my name on the board.

10:09.514 --> 10:10.815
That's...

10:10.849 --> 10:12.550
Oh, you think that's funny?

10:12.584 --> 10:14.719
Yeah, 'cause you were being
like an uptight teacher.

10:14.753 --> 10:16.153
What did we say about deescalating?

10:16.188 --> 10:18.489
More like I'm your superior

10:18.523 --> 10:20.891
at a job you used to have, Marcus.

10:20.926 --> 10:22.193
You're fired.

10:22.227 --> 10:23.894
You're firing me? For nothing?

10:23.929 --> 10:25.663
No, no, no, no, no, no. No!

10:25.697 --> 10:26.697
Let's back it up, okay?

10:26.732 --> 10:28.599
Uh, nobody is getting fired.

10:28.633 --> 10:30.701
And it's not "nothing," all right?

10:30.736 --> 10:33.070
I think what happened was,
maybe you said some things

10:33.105 --> 10:35.686
that tapped into kind of
a gender/power matrix, so...

10:35.718 --> 10:38.476
Ugh, seriously, dude, you're
being a bigger bitch than Amy.

10:41.403 --> 10:42.613
Marcus, you're fired.

10:42.647 --> 10:43.814
Oh...

10:53.418 --> 10:55.552
Okay, so...

10:55.587 --> 10:58.759
you may have heard
that we had an incident.

10:58.760 --> 10:59.893
We had to let Marcus go.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.000
- What?
- What?

11:01.596 --> 11:03.628
Are you allowed to fire people?

11:04.065 --> 11:05.432
That's unclear. Probably.

11:05.466 --> 11:06.733
I don't know. He seemed to think so.

11:06.775 --> 11:09.119
Anyway, the rest of the warehouse

11:09.119 --> 11:10.737
walked out in solidarity with him.

11:10.772 --> 11:12.739
Yeah. They're surprisingly loyal.

11:12.774 --> 11:16.076
Apparently he promised them he
was ushering in a new era, so...

11:16.110 --> 11:19.646
So we are going to unload this truck.

11:22.483 --> 11:24.584
Do we even know how to unload a truck?

11:24.619 --> 11:26.453
Because I came back here once
when they were doing it,

11:26.487 --> 11:28.622
and it is very elaborate
and choreographed.

11:28.656 --> 11:30.892
I mean, it was poppin'. It was hummin'.

11:31.314 --> 11:33.437
It was like boom! Boom! Shabam!

11:33.711 --> 11:36.545
Boom, boom! Alakazam! Sha-pow!

11:36.739 --> 11:38.034
Guys, it's fine, okay?

11:38.065 --> 11:38.832
I've got the manual,

11:38.866 --> 11:41.434
so, you know, all we need, really,

11:41.469 --> 11:44.337
are two people throwing the truck,

11:44.371 --> 11:46.873
one pushing the line,
one on bulk transition,

11:46.907 --> 11:49.442
two pulling pallets,
three pre-pushing HBA,

11:49.477 --> 11:52.508
and one person bowling C and D.

11:54.215 --> 11:56.549
Okay, so that sounds great.

11:56.584 --> 11:57.686
Let's do that.

12:15.669 --> 12:17.570
So, uh, what are you thinking about?

12:17.605 --> 12:19.139
What are you doing? What is that?

12:19.173 --> 12:20.206
I don't know. Just, I thought...

12:20.241 --> 12:22.794
I thought that's something
that people say after...

12:23.511 --> 12:25.278
- Oh.
- Um...

12:29.873 --> 12:31.217
Am I supposed to ask you
what you're thinking about?

12:31.252 --> 12:33.052
- No.
- Because I can if you want.

12:33.087 --> 12:34.420
- Please don't.
- Okay. Sure.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.057
Glenn? I need to talk to you.

12:38.921 --> 12:41.489
I think the heat may be
getting to Jonah and Amy.

12:43.599 --> 12:46.702
They may have gone...
and I try not to use this term...

12:47.401 --> 12:48.186
cray-cray.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.069
They've gone cray-cray.

12:50.104 --> 12:51.671
They're both cray-cray!

12:52.056 --> 12:52.686
Hello!

12:56.443 --> 12:58.044
- All right, let's just go...
- Shh!

12:58.078 --> 12:59.045
It could be a fake walk-away.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.246
He's probably still listening.

13:00.281 --> 13:01.514
Why would he do a fake walk-away?

13:01.549 --> 13:02.649
I always do a fake-out walk-away.

13:02.683 --> 13:04.517
Then I can hear what people
are really saying about me.

13:04.552 --> 13:06.085
And what are they saying about you?

13:06.120 --> 13:07.420
Oh, it's never good.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.422
It looks really complicated.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.523
Yeah, well,

13:10.558 --> 13:12.636
everything's computerized nowadays.

13:12.823 --> 13:14.643
But it's still the same basic guts.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.198
Let me just try diagnostics here.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.066
Uh... ooh, uh...

13:21.335 --> 13:22.268
Oh, uh...

13:22.303 --> 13:24.643
Okay, I seem to have
changed the language.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.900
Okay, guys. Good work.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.150
I know we're all tired,
but we're getting there.

13:37.184 --> 13:40.620
We've only got, like, 200 more boxes.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.754
Almost there.

13:43.324 --> 13:44.357
Where's the scanner?

13:44.391 --> 13:47.525
I've got it. But I kind of
got walled in over here.

13:47.729 --> 13:49.596
Don't worry, Sandra.
Everything's gonna be okay.

13:49.630 --> 13:51.731
Just toss the scanner over to us.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.851
Ow! Scanner's broken.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.147
I can't even help my own employees

14:08.182 --> 14:10.083
when they need me the most.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.363
That's not true.
You help us all the time.

14:14.021 --> 14:14.610
Like how?

14:15.222 --> 14:16.753
Oh, you want examples?

14:17.691 --> 14:18.893
Okay, um,

14:19.526 --> 14:21.361
oh, well, we wouldn't be able

14:21.395 --> 14:23.096
to come in to work in the morning

14:23.130 --> 14:25.181
if you didn't unlock the doors.

14:25.335 --> 14:27.133
Actually, nowadays it's all

14:27.167 --> 14:29.148
opened automatically by computers.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.673
Okay, but who turns on the computer?

14:33.707 --> 14:35.108
Corporate does.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.611
Really? That's awesome.

14:38.379 --> 14:39.435
Ha. Hmm.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.273
There's absolutely no reason
whatsoever for me to be here.

14:45.386 --> 14:48.821
I'm just a pathetic, useless old man,

14:49.377 --> 14:51.767
apparently descended from slave traders.

14:52.660 --> 14:55.828
You're not that old.
What are you, like, 40?

14:55.863 --> 14:57.030
57.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.831
Holy [Bleep].

14:58.866 --> 15:00.477
Should you be up this high?

15:14.763 --> 15:15.683
So...

15:16.450 --> 15:17.417
sex again?

15:17.451 --> 15:19.118
Yeah. Yeah.

15:20.854 --> 15:22.221
Okay, bend your knees this time.

15:22.256 --> 15:24.057
Okay. Will you... can you guide me?

15:24.091 --> 15:26.826
Guide you? I'm walking
backwards. You guide me.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.261
I know, but I can't... I can't see.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.596
Okay, well, all I see
is the box in my face.

15:30.631 --> 15:31.731
Slow down! Slow down! Slow down!

15:35.102 --> 15:37.170
Ow! Ow.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.872
Amy! Oh, God, um... Oh, okay.

15:39.907 --> 15:41.575
Guys, are you okay?

15:41.903 --> 15:43.863
Stand back. I'm gonna break through.

15:46.477 --> 15:48.301
Guys, I can't break through.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.036
Hello?

15:53.318 --> 15:54.545
Hello!

15:57.022 --> 15:59.016
Is anybody coming back to help me?

16:00.525 --> 16:02.393
I know this doesn't help that much,

16:02.427 --> 16:05.396
but you can really take a fall.

16:06.431 --> 16:09.500
You ever considered a
career as a pro wrestler?

16:09.534 --> 16:11.767
Actually, yes.

16:12.203 --> 16:15.005
When I was a kid, I wanted
to be The Ultimate Warrior.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.740
I had the arm ribbons and everything.

16:16.775 --> 16:18.008
I did.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.044
Did you have the big, poufy hair?

16:20.078 --> 16:20.661
Yes.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.885
Breeze feels good.

16:26.351 --> 16:26.969
Yeah.

16:27.352 --> 16:29.709
I'm starting to feel
like a normal person again.

16:30.088 --> 16:32.323
That heat was making me insane.

16:32.357 --> 16:33.591
Yeah.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.438
We fired Marcus.

16:36.761 --> 16:39.396
Like, if you could do anything,

16:39.431 --> 16:40.664
what would you do?

16:42.634 --> 16:44.938
I've always wanted to travel.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.071
Oh, yeah. Me too.

16:47.105 --> 16:48.769
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:48.948 --> 16:51.682
Like, I hear that in some
of the McDonald's in Asia,

16:52.099 --> 16:53.370
they serve spaghetti.

16:53.712 --> 16:55.834
- No way!
- Yeah.

16:56.781 --> 16:59.116
God, I would love to see that!

17:02.621 --> 17:03.179
Wait.

17:04.422 --> 17:05.886
We should just go!

17:07.791 --> 17:08.659
- Oh, what?
- Yeah.

17:08.693 --> 17:11.729
We should just travel
the world together,

17:11.762 --> 17:12.896
you and me.

17:12.941 --> 17:14.278
Oh, well, I mean, I...

17:14.628 --> 17:16.532
You know, I have a baby,

17:16.568 --> 17:18.102
and then there's Bo,

17:18.136 --> 17:19.737
and I'm still finishing up school,

17:19.771 --> 17:23.240
and we haven't really spent
that much time together.

17:23.273 --> 17:24.114
No. No.

17:25.109 --> 17:25.674
Yeah.

17:32.851 --> 17:35.786
Okay, fine. We can travel the world.

17:35.820 --> 17:36.481
Yeah?

17:37.122 --> 17:37.850
Sure.

17:38.749 --> 17:40.758
Oh... oh, man.

17:40.792 --> 17:43.044
We're gonna have to get so many shots!

17:45.764 --> 17:46.664
Listen, I'm just saying

17:46.698 --> 17:48.399
if you put that much effort
into your work...

17:48.433 --> 17:50.668
Can we not turn this
into a job review, please?

17:50.702 --> 17:53.335
Hello? Mr. Sturgis, are you still there?

17:54.773 --> 17:57.741
Uh, yes, this is Glenn Sturgis.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.102
I wear a tie with clouds on it.

18:00.779 --> 18:02.018
Thanks for your patience.

18:02.107 --> 18:04.112
We've finally resolved
the heating issue.

18:04.290 --> 18:06.751
Turns out, it was a problem
with our computers.

18:06.785 --> 18:08.452
It's now been fixed, and the store

18:08.486 --> 18:10.490
should already be cooling back down.

18:10.561 --> 18:12.262
Oh, okay, great.

18:12.390 --> 18:14.087
Hallelujah!

18:16.828 --> 18:19.891
Well, I guess, uh,
we can go back to work.

18:19.953 --> 18:21.656
Ugh, finally.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.601
Hey, uh, I normally wouldn't say this,

18:24.636 --> 18:27.871
but, uh, I had a good time
having sex with you today.

18:27.906 --> 18:31.141
Yeah. Me too. You're... good at it.

18:31.176 --> 18:32.676
- Thanks.
- Yeah. But it's, uh,

18:32.711 --> 18:33.711
not gonna happen again.

18:33.745 --> 18:35.608
- Oh, no, definitely not.
- It might, though.

18:35.608 --> 18:37.715
Hey, you know what? If it did,
wouldn't be opposed to it.

18:37.749 --> 18:38.816
Me too.

18:38.850 --> 18:40.617
But just... just the sex part.

18:40.652 --> 18:41.618
I find the rest of you repulsive.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.454
Oh, the sound of your voice
makes me want

18:43.488 --> 18:44.888
to punch myself in the throat.

18:44.923 --> 18:45.856
Yeah.

18:46.124 --> 18:47.776
I just totally lost it.

18:48.226 --> 18:50.360
I mean, I don't have
the authority to fire Marcus.

18:50.395 --> 18:53.197
Oh, yeah, no, we were, uh...
we were out of our minds.

18:53.804 --> 18:55.632
Ugh. We're gonna have
to swallow our pride

18:55.667 --> 18:57.735
and beg him to come back.

18:57.769 --> 18:59.369
- Oof.
- Marcus,

18:59.404 --> 19:01.697
who thinks drinking water is a scam.

19:01.948 --> 19:05.843
Marcus, who once said,
"Bedsheets are for losers."

19:05.877 --> 19:09.052
And who's, um, coming here right now.

19:12.751 --> 19:15.073
Hey, Marcus, um, we need to talk.

19:15.073 --> 19:16.984
Totally. I am so sorry.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.823
I went for a drive,
I cooled down a lot...

19:19.858 --> 19:21.725
'cause my car doesn't have doors,

19:21.760 --> 19:23.660
and I thought about today.

19:23.710 --> 19:25.236
And I said some things about both of you

19:25.236 --> 19:26.656
that were uncalled for.

19:27.465 --> 19:29.433
I think the heat must have gotten to me.

19:29.467 --> 19:30.464
I'm really sorry.

19:31.569 --> 19:35.606
Well, um, today is your lucky day,

19:35.640 --> 19:37.875
because I haven't
filed the paperwork yet.

19:37.909 --> 19:40.944
So I'm gonna let you off
with a warning this time.

19:40.979 --> 19:42.679
- That's big of you.
- Thank you.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.948
So we can just all come back to work.

19:44.983 --> 19:46.683
- Sure. Whatever.
- And then maybe we should

19:46.718 --> 19:47.918
grab dinner or something tonight.

19:47.952 --> 19:49.753
- Yeah...
- Just, like, to, you know,

19:49.788 --> 19:51.188
hash it all out so we can all
be cool with each other.

19:51.222 --> 19:52.089
That's probably not gonna happen.

19:52.123 --> 19:53.457
We'll keep it open. We'll keep it open.

19:53.491 --> 19:54.525
- Okay. All right.
- Sure.

19:54.559 --> 19:55.759
Thank you guys.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.095
Oh, there's that smile.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.801
I don't know. I can't decide.

20:03.835 --> 20:07.538
Should we go London,
Atlantis, Hong Kong...

20:07.572 --> 20:08.438
right, it's... Uhhuh.

20:08.473 --> 20:11.708
And then... or London,
Hong Kong, Atlantis?

20:11.743 --> 20:13.877
- Uh, yeah.
- It's confusing.

20:13.912 --> 20:16.541
Oh, wait a minute, Glenn.

20:17.248 --> 20:18.782
It's cool in here again.

20:19.484 --> 20:20.885
Wait. How?

20:22.253 --> 20:24.254
You fixed it!

20:24.648 --> 20:25.264
I did?

20:26.591 --> 20:27.947
Oh, my God, I did.

20:28.326 --> 20:30.394
Ha!

20:30.428 --> 20:32.229
Oh, no!

20:32.263 --> 20:33.263
What?

20:33.298 --> 20:36.266
I really wanted us to
travel the world together,

20:36.301 --> 20:39.536
but I-I feel like the store needs you.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.807
- Yeah, it does.
- Yeah.

20:43.842 --> 20:45.042
Mm-hmm.

20:47.812 --> 20:49.552
When you get to Macau,

20:50.448 --> 20:53.058
you buy yourself some McNoodles, kiddo.

20:53.384 --> 20:55.752
- Okay.
- Okay?

20:56.256 --> 20:57.106
Bon voyage.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.758
Oh! Ooh!

21:01.793 --> 21:03.360
What the...

21:03.394 --> 21:04.862
Oh, Glenn, are you okay?

21:04.896 --> 21:05.929
Oh, do you need help?

21:05.964 --> 21:06.930
No, I'm good.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.832
Maybe just try to...

21:10.902 --> 21:12.514
Maybe if you roll out of it?

21:13.471 --> 21:15.318
Yeah, swim! Swim out of it!

21:15.840 --> 21:17.841
Okay. Mm.

21:17.876 --> 21:19.443
You're not going anywhere.
