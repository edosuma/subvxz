You know the kind of guy
who does nothing
but bad things...

00:03.704 --> 00:06.674
and then wonders why
his life sucks?

00:06.707 --> 00:11.112
Well, that was me.
Every time somethin' good
happened to me,

00:11.145 --> 00:13.247
somethin' bad
was always waitin'
around the corner.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.051
Karma.

00:17.085 --> 00:19.187
That's when I realized
I had to change.

00:20.721 --> 00:23.357
So I made a list
of everything bad
I've ever done,

00:23.391 --> 00:26.327
and, one by one,
I'm gonna make up
for all my mistakes.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.329

to be a better person.

My name is Earl.

[ Earl Narrating ]
As important as it is for me
to cross things off my list,

00:34.835 --> 00:38.306
it's also important
to take time out to enjoy
the finer things in life,

00:38.339 --> 00:42.476
like jumpin' a tiny motorcycle
over my brother's head.

00:42.510 --> 00:46.180
I'm excited.
I'm gonna stick my tongue out
to see if he touches it.

00:46.214 --> 00:50.218
But you gotta tell me what
it looks like 'cause I'm too
scared to keep my eyes open.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.357
Earl, we got a problem.

- Ow.
- Jesse's back.

[ Earl Narrating ]
The Jesse Joy was talkin'
about was my ex-girlfriend.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.733
She was also number 145
on my list.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.269
I first met Jesse
at her workplace.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.239
In business terms, I was what
they call a repeat customer.

01:11.272 --> 01:15.576
You keep this up, I'm gonna
have to rename this place
Hickey Bail Bonds.

01:15.609 --> 01:19.680
Well, as an investor, I'm gonna
have to ask you to institute
a no nut-kicking policy. Ow!

01:22.150 --> 01:24.552
Ooh!
[ Chuckles ]
Sorry about that.

01:26.654 --> 01:29.157
Here. You can use
my nut ice for your head.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.292
It's only been on
the outside of my pants.

Aren't you a gentleman.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.197
[ Earl Narrating ]
It was love at first sight.

01:36.230 --> 01:40.201
So we started hangin' out.

01:40.234 --> 01:43.837
In fact, Jesse was the first
person to ever let me jump her
with a tiny motorcycle.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.508
She even got along with Randy,

01:47.541 --> 01:50.611
who finally found someone
who enjoyed Mad Libs
as much as he did.

a butt princess who lived
in a beautiful butt castle."

"Until one day she was captured
by a fire-breathing butt."

Things were goin' so well,

02:12.833 --> 02:15.203
she even gave me a three-week
anniversary present.

02:16.437 --> 02:19.640
Oh, my God!

That's close enough
to get sweat on.

I'll see you later.

Me and Jesse
had a good thing goin'.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.818
And it was all happenin'
pretty fast.

02:30.851 --> 02:34.255
But, not as fast as it happened
later that night with Joy.

02:34.288 --> 02:38.726
In just seven hours, I went
from havin' a semi-serious
three-week girlfriend...

02:38.759 --> 02:41.895
to bein' the husband
of a pregnant woman whose name
I kept forgettin'.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.799
I thought about callin' Jesse
to talk to her...

02:45.833 --> 02:47.968
and tell her
what I had done.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.905
But then I realized
that I'd have to talk to her
and tell her what I had done.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.974
[ Joy ]
Oh, snap.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.877
You got us Metallica tickets
for our honeymoon?

02:56.910 --> 02:59.780
[ Clears Throat ]
Actually, those tickets
are for, uh,

03:01.249 --> 03:04.618

I am so takin' off my panties
and sittin' on your shoulders.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.657
That might upset
the people behind us.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.960
There ain't
nobody behind us.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.899
[ Earl Narrating ]
If tellin' Jesse it was over
was difficult before,

03:18.932 --> 03:22.536
our Metallica honeymoon
had made it impossible.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.339
Great concert.
Baby liked it too.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.808
He's still bangin' his tiny
fists on my cootie wall.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.943
He's gonna be a drummer.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.413
[ Earl Narrating ]
But Jesse eventually
tracked me down,

03:32.446 --> 03:35.949
which wasn't hard
because there were
two places I like to drink.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.952
And since I wasn't
in my El Camino,
well, she found me.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.759

where have you been?

to reach you for days.

Yeah, I, uh--

03:52.833 --> 03:55.269
You went to the concert
without me?

03:55.303 --> 03:58.005
Now, honey,
why would he take you?
It was our honeymoon trip.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.542
Look, Lars even
signed my baby hump.

about, "honeymoon"?

a pretty funny story. Uh--

under your pillow,

will bring you your own man.

I felt bad about Jesse,
but what was I gonna do?

04:28.869 --> 04:31.439
I was married now, and after
seein' my wife's left hook,

04:31.472 --> 04:34.041
I decided it was best
to stay on her good side.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.910

Jesse would have
forgotten about me...

but I was wrong.

Even though Joy's bounty
was 200 bucks...

05:08.976 --> 05:12.780
and a bounty hunter
license was 250,
Jesse took the loss.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.915
She wasn't in it
for the money.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.950
She could have gone
after Joy right then,

05:16.984 --> 05:19.019

to bring her in.
