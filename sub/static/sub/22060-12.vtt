WEBVTT

00:03.558 --> 00:05.159
Oh, what do you mean
he ghosted you?

00:05.161 --> 00:08.762
We went on a couple of dates
and had fun and then nothing.

00:08.764 --> 00:10.097
Nothing?

00:10.099 --> 00:12.666
He didn't respond to any of
my texts or my phone calls.

00:12.668 --> 00:14.235
He's not interested.

00:14.237 --> 00:15.202
Why?

00:15.204 --> 00:16.537
You tell me.

00:16.539 --> 00:17.571
I have no idea.

00:17.573 --> 00:20.741
Well, maybe you
did that thing.

00:20.743 --> 00:21.742
What thing?

00:21.744 --> 00:23.210
The thing where you
chew really loud.

00:23.212 --> 00:24.845
I don't chew really loud!

00:24.847 --> 00:27.147
You are the only person that
has a hang-up about that.

00:27.149 --> 00:28.682
If you say so.

00:28.684 --> 00:31.685
DISPATCHER: 12-David, we have
a 10-30, robbery in progress

00:31.687 --> 00:32.820
at Exceptional Deli,

00:32.822 --> 00:35.389
174 West 74th Street.
Oh, come on.

00:35.391 --> 00:36.790
(siren wailing)

00:43.131 --> 00:45.132
You're under arrest.
- Move it.

00:45.134 --> 00:46.834
Anything you say or do
will be used against you

00:46.836 --> 00:48.602
in a court of law.

00:48.604 --> 00:49.904
Thank God you're here.

00:49.906 --> 00:51.305
Follow me.
MAN: If you need an attorney,

00:51.307 --> 00:54.174
one will be provided for you.
This kid tried to rob me.

00:54.176 --> 00:55.142
- Get him off of me!
- You have the right to remain silent.

00:55.144 --> 00:56.810
Billy, what's going on?

00:56.812 --> 00:58.712
Whoa, come over here.
Calm down, calm down.

00:58.714 --> 01:02.182
This man is under arrest
for-for petty larceny, Jamie.

01:02.184 --> 01:04.952
For-for-for stealing
and disobeying an order

01:04.953 --> 01:07.054
and for being a really bad guy.
- Okay.

01:07.056 --> 01:08.622
Okay, Billy. How about this?
Okay, Billy. Calm down.

01:08.624 --> 01:10.224
How about this?
We go outside

01:10.226 --> 01:11.926
and we'll take care
of this, okay?

01:11.928 --> 01:14.261
Uh... stealer!

01:14.263 --> 01:15.496
All right. All right, Billy.
Okay.

01:15.498 --> 01:16.864
All right.

01:16.866 --> 01:19.700
He stole those cigarettes
and-and-and he stole candy.

01:19.702 --> 01:20.868
I don't steal candy.
- Right.

01:20.870 --> 01:23.037
We-we know, we know, Bill,
we know you don't.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.940
But, hey. Hey, Bill.
Bill, hey.

01:25.942 --> 01:28.008
When-when something
like this happens,

01:28.010 --> 01:30.077
what are you supposed to do?

01:30.079 --> 01:31.045
Call...

01:31.047 --> 01:34.415
9-1-1.

01:34.417 --> 01:37.584
Call 911. But-but-but he-he was
going to flee the scene.

01:37.586 --> 01:38.852
He was breaking
the law, Bill,

01:38.854 --> 01:40.614
and you're a good citizen
for trying to help.

01:40.722 --> 01:43.223
Next time, don't put
yourself in harm's way.

01:43.225 --> 01:44.658
Otherwise, you'd be
putting us out of a job.

01:44.660 --> 01:46.459
I don't want to do that.

01:46.461 --> 01:48.061
- You call 911.
- Mm-hmm.

01:48.063 --> 01:50.363
And if they run,
we'll chase 'em, okay?

01:50.365 --> 01:52.198
Are you going to arrest him?

01:52.200 --> 01:53.700
Yeah, he's getting
a desk appearance ticket

01:53.702 --> 01:55.605
and he's gonna have to
explain himself to a judge.

01:55.606 --> 01:57.204
Oh, ho, ho.
Good!

01:57.205 --> 01:58.805
All because
of you, Billy.

01:58.807 --> 02:00.640
But, hey, listen, next time...

02:00.642 --> 02:04.311
Call 911. Call 911
and, uh, don't hold him.

02:04.313 --> 02:05.378
Right.

02:05.380 --> 02:07.614
You be careful out there.
You, too, Billy.

02:10.283 --> 02:11.818
Yeah, you be careful, Bill.

02:14.822 --> 02:17.057
And one more bonus of the job,

02:17.059 --> 02:19.426
you can sit down with
a president, a rock star,

02:19.428 --> 02:21.194
famous athlete,
and a cop.

02:21.196 --> 02:24.364
Whose stories does
everyone want to hear?

02:24.366 --> 02:26.466
The cop's.

02:26.468 --> 02:28.068
Believe it or not, yes.

02:28.070 --> 02:31.204
I've seen it many times,
and I'll tell you why.

02:32.306 --> 02:36.409
Some have happy endings,
some have heartbreaking ones.

02:36.411 --> 02:39.646
But the best ones reveal
the unvarnished truth

02:39.648 --> 02:43.583
of who we really are.

02:43.585 --> 02:46.086
Sounds like you really
miss being a cop.

02:48.889 --> 02:52.959
I miss the job every single day.

02:52.961 --> 02:56.262
But I really, really
miss the bad guys.

02:56.264 --> 02:57.731
(laughing)

02:57.733 --> 03:01.768
Well, by that, I mean, there is
no better feeling for a cop

03:01.770 --> 03:04.571
than slapping the cuffs
on a bad guy

03:04.573 --> 03:06.906
and getting him off the street.

03:06.908 --> 03:08.074
All right, well,
we've taken enough

03:08.076 --> 03:09.242
of the police
commissioner's time,

03:09.244 --> 03:12.545
unless anybody has any last,
final question?

03:12.547 --> 03:15.815
Well, I have a question
for all of you.

03:15.817 --> 03:17.751
How many of you want to be cops?

03:21.689 --> 03:23.823
Anyone?

03:26.594 --> 03:28.728
Yeah.

03:28.730 --> 03:32.265
I want to be the first black
female police commissioner.

03:32.267 --> 03:35.602
(chuckles)
Good for you.

03:35.604 --> 03:38.371
But not 'cause I like cops
or anything like that.

03:40.808 --> 03:42.575
'Cause I want to
change the system.

03:42.577 --> 03:44.978
I want to change
everything about it.

03:44.980 --> 03:47.814
GORMLEY:
Okay, uh, listen up.

03:47.816 --> 03:49.249
We're gonna
exit out this way.

03:49.251 --> 03:51.618
Officer Dubrowski is gonna
take you back downstairs.

03:51.620 --> 03:52.585
Follow him.

03:52.587 --> 03:54.087
Thank you.

03:54.089 --> 03:55.155
Uh, excuse me.

03:55.157 --> 03:57.223
Um, sorry.

03:57.225 --> 03:58.725
Um, what's your name?
- Sophia.

03:58.727 --> 04:01.494
Um, can I give you this?

04:01.496 --> 04:02.996
I'd love it if
you called me.

04:02.998 --> 04:05.198
I'd like to talk to you
some more about this.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.900
Sure. Okay.

04:06.902 --> 04:07.834
Okay.

04:07.836 --> 04:10.069
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

04:10.071 --> 04:11.538
Thank you.
Good luck, Sophia.

04:11.540 --> 04:12.739
Thanks.

04:17.478 --> 04:19.245
Hey!
- Hi.

04:19.247 --> 04:20.245
You got here early.

04:20.248 --> 04:22.115
Hi, Lieutenant.

04:22.117 --> 04:23.049
Ms. Reagan.

04:23.051 --> 04:24.517
I'm glad I got
to hear that.

04:24.519 --> 04:27.120
I didn't even know
you missed the job.

04:27.122 --> 04:31.658
Well... I do miss
living those stories.

04:31.660 --> 04:34.360
Well, as you can see, nobody
wants to be a cop anymore.

04:34.362 --> 04:36.729
I do.

04:36.731 --> 04:42.168
You do?

04:42.170 --> 04:44.771
What do you know.

04:44.773 --> 04:47.807
I signed up to take
the exam on Monday.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.943
Well... (chuckles)
I'll leave you two.

04:49.945 --> 04:51.044
I'll catch you later, boss.

04:51.046 --> 04:53.112
Yeah.

04:53.114 --> 04:55.248
But I didn't tell Mom yet.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.516
Well, you want it
to be a surprise.

04:56.518 --> 04:59.886
Why don't I think
she'll be happy about it?

04:59.888 --> 05:01.788
Why wouldn't she be
happy about it?

05:01.790 --> 05:04.090
It's the family business.

05:04.092 --> 05:07.494
Because it's the
family business.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.831
Let's talk.

05:11.833 --> 05:15.168
All I'm asking is that you
request that he be remanded.

05:15.170 --> 05:16.135
It's not my case.

05:16.137 --> 05:17.270
What do you mean
it's not your case?

05:17.272 --> 05:19.305
You're the
supervising ADA.

05:19.307 --> 05:21.407
Last time I checked, supervising
means you're the boss.

05:21.409 --> 05:22.909
Good morning, Anthony.

05:22.911 --> 05:24.544
Used to be.
- (sighs) Yeah.

05:24.546 --> 05:26.179
Nice to see you, too.

05:26.181 --> 05:28.314
We need to speak to the witness
in the Sanchez murder case.

05:28.316 --> 05:29.516
Uh, the vic's grandmother.
(phone rings)

05:29.518 --> 05:31.584
Yeah, Rosalie Morales.
I remember her.

05:31.586 --> 05:34.454
Yeah, and I want to make sure
that she's prepped for court.

05:34.456 --> 05:36.289
Erin Reagan.

05:38.025 --> 05:39.659
Ah, right.

05:39.661 --> 05:41.027
I'll be right over.

05:41.029 --> 05:42.862
Can you speak to
the witness on your own?

05:42.864 --> 05:44.063
DANNY: Think you
can handle that

05:44.065 --> 05:45.398
all by yourself, tough guy?

05:45.400 --> 05:46.699
Yeah, well, at least I don't
have to come up here

05:46.701 --> 05:48.034
begging my sister
for favors.

05:48.036 --> 05:50.036
You know, I remember when you
used to knock down doors.

05:50.038 --> 05:51.070
Now you just open doors.

05:51.072 --> 05:52.305
ERIN:
Guys, guys.

05:52.307 --> 05:53.706
You know how juvenile you sound?

05:56.210 --> 05:57.210
Thank you, Anthony.

05:57.212 --> 05:58.878
Let me know how it goes.

06:00.648 --> 06:03.550
Don't forget the door
on the way out.

06:07.922 --> 06:09.455
(intercom buzzes)

06:16.830 --> 06:18.398
Excuse me.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.267
Have you seen this woman around?
Ms. Morales?

06:21.269 --> 06:25.405
The massage parlor, upstairs.

06:25.407 --> 06:27.874
Thank you.

06:32.079 --> 06:33.546

07:32.917 --> 07:36.018
Excuse me. Anthony Abetemarco,
was he brought in?

07:36.020 --> 07:37.052
He's being prepped
for surgery.

07:37.054 --> 07:39.054
- Well, can I see him?
- I'm sorry.

07:39.056 --> 07:40.355
Can you at least tell me

07:40.357 --> 07:41.523
if he's gonna be okay?
- Hey.

07:41.525 --> 07:42.658
Hey.
- He's okay.

07:42.660 --> 07:43.726
He's not likely.

07:43.728 --> 07:45.027
You saw him?

07:45.029 --> 07:48.163
I came in as soon as it
went out over the air.

07:48.165 --> 07:50.265
Seems like the bullet didn't
hit any major arteries,

07:50.267 --> 07:52.034
but did do
some muscle damage.

07:52.036 --> 07:54.403
I... It's all my fault.
I should've been with him.

07:54.405 --> 07:56.004
I...
- Okay, no, take it easy.

07:56.006 --> 07:57.272
All right? What would've
happened then?

07:57.274 --> 07:58.440
You would've
been shot, too.

07:58.442 --> 07:59.942
- You have a shooter?
- No.

07:59.944 --> 08:02.044
When Anthony came in,
he was unconscious.

08:02.046 --> 08:03.412
We don't have any
witnesses yet,

08:03.414 --> 08:05.247
but I promise you,
as soon as I hear anything,

08:05.249 --> 08:07.382
I will let you know.

08:07.384 --> 08:09.685
Wait. You're investigating?

08:09.687 --> 08:11.019
Yeah, I'm investigating.

08:11.021 --> 08:14.289
Look, whatever differences
he and I have, he's still a cop.

08:14.291 --> 08:15.491
I'm on it.

08:19.195 --> 08:22.030
(camera clicking)

08:25.335 --> 08:26.869
Oh, what a mess.
Can I help you?

08:26.871 --> 08:28.303
Help us?

08:28.305 --> 08:29.805
Don't you mean
can we help you?

08:29.807 --> 08:31.073
It's our crime scene.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.707
My crime scene.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.476
Who are you?

08:34.477 --> 08:35.977
Mancuso, I'm with the
Department of Investigation.

08:35.980 --> 08:38.212
So?

08:38.215 --> 08:40.115
So?

08:40.116 --> 08:41.549
I'm looking
into the shooting.

08:41.552 --> 08:43.184
Why is D.O.I. looking into this?

08:43.187 --> 08:44.987
Yeah, what'd you think
Anthony was doing here?

08:44.989 --> 08:46.421
Getting a happy ending
or something?

08:46.423 --> 08:47.790
Are you gonna be a problem?

08:47.792 --> 08:50.025
Look, we caught the shooting, so
it would save us all some time

08:50.027 --> 08:51.760
if we just cooperate.
It's fine by me.

08:51.762 --> 08:53.729
As long as you understand
that on corruption matters,

08:53.731 --> 08:54.730
I take the lead.

08:54.732 --> 08:57.299
That's fine by us
because, unlike you,

08:57.301 --> 09:00.302
we don't get our jollies off of
looking for dirt on other cops.

09:00.304 --> 09:02.671
Good cops don't have
any dirt to find.

09:02.673 --> 09:04.640
Mm-hmm.
- Any witnesses?

09:04.642 --> 09:06.642
The owner says he was the
only one here at the time.

09:06.644 --> 09:09.011
Good. Where was he
at the time?

09:09.013 --> 09:10.379
Says he was in the back.

09:10.381 --> 09:12.915
Heard some yelling,
then shots were fired.

09:12.917 --> 09:16.084
When he finally came out,
Anthony was on the floor,

09:16.086 --> 09:18.420
and the shooter was in the wind.

09:18.422 --> 09:19.555
That's convenient.

09:19.557 --> 09:20.856
DANNY:
Sure is.

09:20.858 --> 09:22.357
And let me guess, you don't
have a description

09:22.359 --> 09:23.458
of the shooter,
either, do you?

09:23.460 --> 09:24.927
He said he didn't see him.

09:24.929 --> 09:25.928
Did you lean on him?

09:25.930 --> 09:28.463
Of course you didn't.
You know, maybe,

09:28.465 --> 09:30.432
you ought to stick to
investigating corruption

09:30.434 --> 09:32.768
instead of shootings.

09:39.742 --> 09:41.076
I'm looking for
Anthony Abetemarco.

09:41.078 --> 09:42.978
NURSE:
Are you family?

09:42.980 --> 09:45.113
I'm his wife. Ex-wife.

09:45.115 --> 09:46.982
Vivian Abetemarco.

09:46.984 --> 09:48.617
NURSE:
He's still in surgery.

09:48.619 --> 09:49.885
H-How much longer?

09:49.887 --> 09:51.520
It will be a while.
I would take a seat.

09:51.522 --> 09:52.688
Vivian?

09:53.890 --> 09:55.057
Hi, Erin Reagan.

09:55.059 --> 09:56.859
You're Erin Reagan.

09:56.861 --> 09:57.960
Nice to meet you.

09:57.962 --> 09:59.628
And this is?

09:59.630 --> 10:01.496
Our daughter, Sophia.

10:01.498 --> 10:02.531
Hi.

10:02.533 --> 10:04.499
Is my dad gonna be okay?

10:04.501 --> 10:06.835
That's what the doctors
are telling me.

10:06.837 --> 10:09.538
You can sit, honey.
We'll probably be here a while.

10:14.344 --> 10:16.879
It's nice to finally
meet her, though.

10:16.881 --> 10:19.281
I wish it was under
different circumstances.

10:19.283 --> 10:21.149
He's always talking
about you to her.

10:21.151 --> 10:23.719
He is?
- Yeah. He is.

10:23.721 --> 10:26.388
Always telling her to be
just like Erin Reagan.

10:26.390 --> 10:28.557
Oh, okay.

10:28.559 --> 10:30.525
Yeah, Anthony thinks
very highly of you.

10:31.661 --> 10:33.729
Me, not so much.

10:33.731 --> 10:36.231
I'm... I'm sorry?

10:36.233 --> 10:39.201
You sent Anthony to interview
a witness by himself.

10:39.203 --> 10:42.271
I certainly did not mean
to put him in harm's way.

10:42.273 --> 10:43.505
Right.

10:43.507 --> 10:46.541
But he just can't say no to you.

10:49.479 --> 10:50.812
(woman speaking Spanish on TV)

10:50.814 --> 10:52.314
I told you, he never came here.

10:52.316 --> 10:53.749
So you were here
all day, though?

10:53.751 --> 10:55.117
Yes, all day.

10:55.119 --> 10:57.552
You ever go to that
massage parlor next door?

10:57.554 --> 11:00.289
Do I look like I go
to a massage parlor?

11:00.291 --> 11:02.624
So the detective
who was supposed to

11:02.626 --> 11:04.860
interview me about
my granddaughter's murder

11:04.862 --> 11:06.728
went to the
massage parlor instead?

11:06.730 --> 11:09.431
We don't know that. We're still
investigating what happened.

11:09.433 --> 11:11.033
Uh-huh. I can tell
you what happened.

11:11.035 --> 11:12.634
He took a "detour."

11:12.636 --> 11:14.369
We'll take your theory
under advisement.

11:14.371 --> 11:16.705
So, this place next door,
the massage parlor--

11:16.707 --> 11:18.006
what can you tell us
about it?

11:18.008 --> 11:20.075
I know it's mostly men go there.

11:20.077 --> 11:22.010
I know it's mostly women
work there.

11:22.012 --> 11:25.080
You're the detectives,
you figure it out.

11:28.451 --> 11:30.519
We'll let ourselves out.

11:34.023 --> 11:35.557
She's here.

11:35.559 --> 11:38.593
FRANK: Hey.
- Hi.

11:38.595 --> 11:41.863
Hi.

11:41.865 --> 11:43.131
How's Anthony?

11:43.133 --> 11:45.901
He's gonna be okay.

11:49.839 --> 11:53.775
That's good to hear,
but not why you're here.

11:53.777 --> 11:55.777
No.

11:57.046 --> 11:58.547
Nicky?

11:59.816 --> 12:02.818
I don't want her to take
the police exam, Dad.

12:02.820 --> 12:05.053
And why not?

12:05.055 --> 12:07.990
I just came from Anthony,
shot in the line of duty.

12:07.992 --> 12:10.525
Which has absolutely nothing
to do with her taking the test.

12:10.527 --> 12:11.827
It does to me.

12:11.829 --> 12:13.095
It's a classroom test.

12:13.097 --> 12:15.263
It's not an undercover
narcotics operation.

12:15.265 --> 12:19.234
It's the first step.
And Nicky is not a cop.

12:20.336 --> 12:22.304
You don't know that.

12:22.306 --> 12:25.607
I am very proud to come
from a cop family.

12:25.609 --> 12:27.642
It defines who I am
and what I do.

12:27.644 --> 12:29.644
Nicky is not a cop.

12:29.646 --> 12:31.213
She doesn't get to decide

12:31.215 --> 12:33.015
what she wants to do
for a living?

12:33.017 --> 12:34.149
That's not fair.

12:34.151 --> 12:36.952
But it is the real
question here.

12:38.521 --> 12:40.989
You remember when I wanted
to take the exam--

12:40.991 --> 12:42.224
how Mom reacted?

12:42.226 --> 12:44.793
Yes. But moms are hardwired

12:44.795 --> 12:46.995
to worry about
their child's safety.

12:46.997 --> 12:50.032
And I'm a mom first.

12:53.903 --> 12:56.405
I find it hard to believe
you have no idea

12:56.407 --> 12:57.439
why this guy
stopped calling you.

12:57.441 --> 12:58.440
How can that be?

12:58.442 --> 13:00.208
Well, most guys find out
that I'm a cop,

13:00.210 --> 13:01.309
and that's an
instant turnoff.

13:01.311 --> 13:04.913
God forbid I should
carry a gun and kick ass.

13:04.915 --> 13:05.881
So, maybe that's it.

13:05.883 --> 13:07.082
No.

13:07.084 --> 13:08.617
This guy seemed to be
one of the few

13:08.619 --> 13:09.751
who thought it was cool.

13:09.753 --> 13:11.286
Well, maybe you did something
to turn him off.

13:11.288 --> 13:12.487
See, there you go again.

13:12.489 --> 13:13.789
What?
- Why do you always assume

13:13.791 --> 13:15.157
it's something that I did?

13:15.159 --> 13:16.691
Why can't it be that
he's insecure,

13:16.693 --> 13:17.993
or that he had hang-ups
about something,

13:17.995 --> 13:19.127
or that he's immature?

13:19.129 --> 13:20.862
Uh, no, I...

13:20.864 --> 13:23.198
DISPATCHER: All units in the vicinity of
West 81st Street and 9th Avenue,

13:23.200 --> 13:28.770
we have an unauthorized male,
white, operating an NYPD RMP.

13:30.306 --> 13:32.507
(sirens wailing)

13:35.111 --> 13:37.012
(tires screeching)

13:47.156 --> 13:49.091
(sirens chirping)

13:51.594 --> 13:54.463
Stand back.
Stand back. Stand back!

13:54.465 --> 13:55.831
Put your hands on the wheel,
where I can see 'em!

13:55.833 --> 13:57.432
Stand back!
Stand back!

13:57.434 --> 13:59.067
Captain, Captain,
we know this guy.

13:59.069 --> 14:00.936
I said hands
on the wheel, now!

14:00.938 --> 14:04.206
Hands on your head.
Hands on your head now!

14:04.208 --> 14:05.674
He wouldn't hurt anybody.

14:05.676 --> 14:06.908
He stole an RMP.

14:06.910 --> 14:08.176
He's a cop buff, boss.

14:08.178 --> 14:10.112
Let me see your hands!

14:10.114 --> 14:12.447
- Billy. Billy, don't move.
- Put your hands where I can see 'em!

14:12.449 --> 14:14.116
Don't reach for anything.

14:14.118 --> 14:15.383
BILLY:
Let me see your hands.

14:15.385 --> 14:16.618
JAMIE:
He's developmentally disabled.

14:16.620 --> 14:18.453
- We know him from the neighborhood.
- Congratulations.

14:18.455 --> 14:19.554
He doesn't have a gun.

14:19.556 --> 14:20.856
(moaning)

14:20.858 --> 14:23.058
Everyone, hey, please,
holster your weapons.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.860
Holster your weapons!

14:24.862 --> 14:26.995
Do not holster your weapons.
Stand down, Officer.

14:26.997 --> 14:28.296
Please, let me go in there
and talk to him.

14:28.298 --> 14:29.831
Okay, tell everyone to
holster their weapons.

14:29.833 --> 14:31.032
Stand down, Officer.
That's an order.

14:31.034 --> 14:34.002
Hands on your head.
You're under arrest, Jamie.

14:34.004 --> 14:36.471
Okay, look, Billy, I'm putting
my hands on my head. Look.

14:36.473 --> 14:38.006
You have the right
to remain silent.

14:38.008 --> 14:41.042
Anything you say may
be used against you...

14:41.044 --> 14:42.210
What-what are you doing?

14:42.212 --> 14:43.845
BILLY: You have the right
to an attorney.

14:43.847 --> 14:44.813
Lower your damn weapons!

14:44.815 --> 14:46.481
HOLLIS:
Officer! Officer!

14:46.483 --> 14:48.116
- You have the right to an attorney.
- I'm giving you a direct order

14:48.118 --> 14:49.151
to return back to your RMP.

14:49.153 --> 14:52.020
...one, one will be
provided for you.

14:52.022 --> 14:53.388
Okay, can I come talk
to you, Billy?

14:53.390 --> 14:56.258
Having understood them, do you
still wish to speak to me?

14:56.260 --> 14:57.826
I do wish to speak
to you, Billy.

14:57.828 --> 15:00.595
I do. Because we got
a situation here.

15:00.597 --> 15:03.598
We got a situation here.
Yeah, you see these

15:03.600 --> 15:04.966
other officers?

15:04.968 --> 15:06.434
They're a little scared,
all right?

15:06.436 --> 15:07.836
So I need you
to help me

15:07.838 --> 15:10.205
show them that everything
is okay.

15:10.207 --> 15:11.206
Can you do that?

15:11.208 --> 15:13.041
I heard a 1085.

15:13.043 --> 15:14.309
Okay.

15:14.311 --> 15:17.312
"Officer needs assistance."
I wanted to help!

15:17.314 --> 15:19.748
1085!
- Okay, Billy,

15:19.750 --> 15:20.882
but right now,

15:20.884 --> 15:24.519
I'm the officer
that needs assistance, okay?

15:24.521 --> 15:25.854
So can you help me out?

15:25.856 --> 15:28.290
(groaning):
Help Jamie.

15:28.292 --> 15:29.457
Can you do that?

15:31.627 --> 15:33.828
(moans)

15:33.830 --> 15:35.830
Mm-hmm.

15:35.832 --> 15:38.300
Hmm.
- Okay.

15:38.302 --> 15:39.467
All right,
I'm gonna open the door,

15:39.469 --> 15:41.303
and we're gonna walk
back to my car.

15:41.305 --> 15:42.904
Hands behind your
head, all right?

15:42.906 --> 15:44.406
Okay?

15:44.408 --> 15:45.874
Okay.

15:45.876 --> 15:47.008
Hands on your head.

15:47.010 --> 15:48.176
Hands on my head.

15:48.178 --> 15:49.377
Okay?

15:53.783 --> 15:56.518
Right?

15:58.087 --> 15:59.554
Okay, Billy.

15:59.556 --> 16:00.655
Okay, I'm gonna...

16:00.657 --> 16:02.324
You know what?
Can we show these guys?

16:02.326 --> 16:03.825
How we cuff people, Billy?

16:03.827 --> 16:05.860
Okay, Jamie.

16:05.862 --> 16:07.696
All right, let's do it.

16:09.332 --> 16:10.332
Okay, hands behind your back.

16:10.334 --> 16:12.634
This is how we do it.

16:12.636 --> 16:16.004
Right?

16:16.006 --> 16:17.239
Okay.

16:17.241 --> 16:19.441
(handcuffs clicking)

16:24.413 --> 16:26.681
You're a good cop.

16:26.683 --> 16:28.550
You, too, Bill.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.252
All right?

16:30.254 --> 16:32.153
Hmm.

16:40.630 --> 16:43.231
You disobeyed a direct order.
I was just trying to tell you

16:43.233 --> 16:45.634
that we knew the guy, boss.
Why couldn't you trust me?

16:45.636 --> 16:47.002
It's not my job
to trust you.

16:47.004 --> 16:49.104
It's to make decisions
that keep my officers safe.

16:49.106 --> 16:50.472
I just wanted an opportunity...

16:50.474 --> 16:53.275
You don't get an opportunity
to do anything without my say.

16:53.277 --> 16:55.610
Just wanted you to know that
we knew the guy, that he had mental problems.

16:55.612 --> 16:57.245
Which makes the situation
even more volatile.

16:57.247 --> 16:58.213
I knew he didn't have a gun.

16:58.215 --> 16:59.281
And how did
you know that?

16:59.283 --> 17:01.049
Was it your Spidey-sense?

17:01.051 --> 17:02.183
I knew I could talk him down.

17:02.185 --> 17:03.518
You think, because
your last name is Reagan,

17:03.520 --> 17:04.452
that you can disobey orders,

17:04.454 --> 17:05.553
and do whatever
it is you want.

17:05.555 --> 17:06.788
I think I can do
whatever I want to do

17:06.790 --> 17:08.323
because you're clearly
a jackass.

17:08.325 --> 17:09.824
JANKO:
Oh, wait.

17:09.826 --> 17:10.892
Jamie. Hey, listen. Hey.

17:10.894 --> 17:11.859
didn't mean that.

17:11.862 --> 17:13.994
Tensions were high.
We know Billy.

17:13.997 --> 17:15.463
Now you have your girlfriend
sticking up for you?

17:15.464 --> 17:16.998
What did you just say?
- Eddie.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.968
You really are a jackass.

17:19.970 --> 17:21.970
Consider yourselves suspended.

17:21.972 --> 17:23.872
Pending charges for
insubordination.

17:23.874 --> 17:25.674
Before you sign off,
you got to turn in your shields,

17:25.675 --> 17:28.510
your guns and your I.D. badges.

17:32.048 --> 17:34.149
(sighs)

17:47.106 --> 17:48.273
Oh, no.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.008
Did I die and wake up in Hell?

17:50.010 --> 17:52.144
That's funny.

17:52.146 --> 17:53.745
Doc says you're gonna be okay.

17:53.747 --> 17:55.347
Yeah? Then why are you here?

17:55.349 --> 17:56.982
'Cause I caught the case.

17:58.184 --> 17:59.851
Would you mind answering
a few questions for me?

17:59.853 --> 18:01.486
Yeah, I do mind.

18:01.488 --> 18:03.321
Oh, come on.

18:03.323 --> 18:04.723
Look, I get it, all right?

18:04.725 --> 18:06.324
We're not fans
of each other.

18:06.326 --> 18:09.027
You think I'm a prick,
I know you're an ass.

18:09.029 --> 18:11.396
But it is
what it is. Okay?

18:11.398 --> 18:12.998
That's personal,
this is business.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.867
Now, just help me find the son
of a bitch who did this to you.

18:16.736 --> 18:18.704
Hello?

18:18.706 --> 18:22.074
Oh, you know what? Whatever.

18:22.076 --> 18:24.076
I tried Morales's apartment.

18:24.078 --> 18:25.677
She wasn't in.

18:25.679 --> 18:27.245
I showed a photo
to her neighbor,

18:27.247 --> 18:29.881
and she pointed me
to the massage parlor.

18:29.883 --> 18:31.349
When I was walking up
the stairs,

18:31.351 --> 18:33.418
I heard two guys arguing
in Spanish.

18:33.420 --> 18:36.121
I got shot just as I
was taking out my gun.

18:36.123 --> 18:38.757
I'm pretty sure I hit him.

18:38.759 --> 18:41.126
Wait, you... you hit him?

18:41.128 --> 18:43.762
Yeah.
You mean you shot the perp?

18:43.764 --> 18:44.763
Yeah.

18:44.765 --> 18:45.764
Are you sure?

18:45.766 --> 18:47.132
Yeah.

18:47.134 --> 18:48.166
Okay, where'd you hit him?

18:48.168 --> 18:49.735
I mean, where on the body
did you hit him?

18:49.737 --> 18:50.869
Hit his leg, I think.

18:50.871 --> 18:52.204
But I didn't do
too much damage

18:52.206 --> 18:55.073
because he was still able
to hightail it out of there.

18:55.075 --> 18:56.808
Okay. All right.

18:56.810 --> 18:58.376
Now, see, was that difficult?

18:59.846 --> 19:02.514
Okay, um...

19:02.516 --> 19:05.383
One other question. Um...

19:05.385 --> 19:07.953
What the hell were you doing
at the massage parlor?

19:07.955 --> 19:09.287
I just told you.

19:09.289 --> 19:11.323
Right. You went there

19:11.325 --> 19:13.892
because you thought
the grandmother

19:13.894 --> 19:15.494
that you were looking for

19:15.496 --> 19:17.462
was supposed to be there
in the massage parlor.

19:17.464 --> 19:20.065
First of all, this grandmother
is 60 years old, not 100.

19:20.067 --> 19:21.600
Mm.
- And why would I doubt it

19:21.602 --> 19:23.135
when I was told
she was at the massage parlor?

19:23.137 --> 19:24.369
I don't know.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.604
Oh, I get it.

19:25.606 --> 19:27.005
What?
- You think I was there

19:27.007 --> 19:28.907
on company time
getting a massage.

19:28.909 --> 19:30.275
What?!

19:30.277 --> 19:31.676
You think I-I'm looking
for happy endings...

19:31.678 --> 19:32.944
- Oh.
- ...in a sleazy massage parlor

19:32.946 --> 19:35.413
for kicks while I'm on duty?

19:35.415 --> 19:37.015
That's not what I was saying.

19:37.017 --> 19:38.817
I mean, obviously,
it wasn't a happy ending.

19:38.819 --> 19:40.352
Look how the hell
it turned out for you.

19:40.354 --> 19:41.620
Get the hell out!

19:41.622 --> 19:42.988
Leave me alone.

19:42.990 --> 19:45.223
Get out.

19:45.992 --> 19:48.460
Go!
- All right.

19:53.466 --> 19:55.300
(elevator bell dings) No misgivings about
her taking the test?

19:55.302 --> 19:56.601
None.

19:56.603 --> 19:58.537
- What if she wasn't related to you?
- Still none.

19:58.539 --> 19:59.905
Even in this climate?

19:59.907 --> 20:01.706
In spring, summer and fall.

20:01.708 --> 20:02.874
Thank you, Baker.

20:02.876 --> 20:05.877
I think it is a
calling and an honor

20:05.879 --> 20:07.212
to serve in this department.

20:07.214 --> 20:09.781
But that it's Nicky
doesn't even make you blink?

20:09.783 --> 20:12.050
If a smart, savvy,
young candidate

20:12.052 --> 20:14.219
from a long line
of dedicated cops

20:14.221 --> 20:16.955
wants to take the exam--
if I blink at that,

20:16.957 --> 20:19.224
you should throw me
out the door.

20:19.226 --> 20:20.959
And...

20:20.961 --> 20:23.795
on another
kind of related matter,

20:23.797 --> 20:26.398
I've been looking at the
curriculum for our explorers.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.100
I didn't like much
of what I saw.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.168
Which part?

20:30.170 --> 20:32.771
The part that says
police work is the same

20:32.773 --> 20:34.773
as every other
civil service job.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.843
In other words,
most of the parts.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.477
Well, I could take a look-see.

20:39.479 --> 20:41.780
Look, it's kind of like
recruiting for the NBA

20:41.782 --> 20:43.815
and stressing
the great knee doctors

20:43.817 --> 20:45.550
and free sneakers.

20:45.552 --> 20:47.085
Kind of misses the heart of it.

20:47.087 --> 20:49.054
(chuckles): Well,
I don't think it's that bad.

20:49.056 --> 20:50.822
Well, it's what I think it is.

20:50.824 --> 20:52.891
Well, what kind of heart
you talking about?

20:52.893 --> 20:55.193
The kind that makes them want
to become cops

20:55.195 --> 20:57.462
would be a good start.

20:58.331 --> 21:00.265
Garrett?

21:00.267 --> 21:03.401
Well, how do you
safely replicate the thrills

21:03.403 --> 21:05.537
of being on the street?
These are kids.

21:07.306 --> 21:11.509
Our best cops
telling their best stories.

21:11.511 --> 21:13.245
(door opens)

21:13.247 --> 21:15.313
She's early.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.349
Oh, okay.

21:17.351 --> 21:19.217
Let's have her.

21:20.419 --> 21:21.887
- Hey.
- Nicky.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.055
How's it going?
NICKY: Hi, guys.

21:24.057 --> 21:25.490
We'll finish this later?

21:25.492 --> 21:27.025
Get started on it first.

21:29.295 --> 21:31.029
Please.

21:35.868 --> 21:37.969
Okay, let's hear it.

21:37.971 --> 21:39.738
Hear what?

21:39.740 --> 21:42.507
Why I shouldn't take the exam.

21:42.509 --> 21:45.410
You think that's
why I asked you up here?

21:45.412 --> 21:46.811
Why else?

21:46.813 --> 21:48.914
Why would I do that?

21:48.916 --> 21:51.950
Because Mom asked you to.

21:51.952 --> 21:54.519
Have I ever done something

21:54.521 --> 21:56.388
simply because your mother
asked me to?

21:56.390 --> 21:57.923
I have no way of knowing that.

21:57.925 --> 22:00.892
Okay, have I ever
denied you anything

22:00.894 --> 22:03.561
without hearing you out first?

22:03.563 --> 22:05.931
No.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.232
Thank you.

22:07.234 --> 22:09.534
For your information,

22:09.536 --> 22:12.938
I asked you up here
to help you study.

22:13.773 --> 22:15.774
Really?

22:15.776 --> 22:16.808
Really.

22:16.810 --> 22:18.977
And what about Mom?

22:18.979 --> 22:21.079
- I didn't invite her.
- I meant

22:21.081 --> 22:22.714
about how
she's feeling.

22:22.716 --> 22:26.451
Oh, her job is to worry
and give you reasons

22:26.453 --> 22:30.488
why you shouldn't do something
and hopefully,

22:30.490 --> 22:32.557
a few reasons
why you should.

22:32.559 --> 22:36.428
Take a look at that picture
for exactly five minutes

22:36.430 --> 22:41.266
and then I'm gonna
ask you questions.

22:41.268 --> 22:42.534
Here's the tip.

22:42.536 --> 22:44.002
Notice all the
surroundings.

22:44.004 --> 22:46.738
Don't just look
at the person.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.007
How many entrances
to the building?

22:49.009 --> 22:50.375
How many windows
in the building?

22:50.377 --> 22:51.543
What lights are on

22:51.545 --> 22:52.677
in those windows?

22:52.679 --> 22:53.845
What time of day is it?

22:53.847 --> 22:55.013
Stuff like that.

22:56.248 --> 22:58.750
Go.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.901
It is possible Anthony
went off the reservation,

23:16.903 --> 23:18.169
took a detour.

23:18.171 --> 23:20.338
I doubt it.
It's not his M.O.

23:20.340 --> 23:21.606
I thought you
didn't like him.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.408
I don't like him
poaching our cases.

23:23.410 --> 23:25.543
Doesn't make him a bad cop.
Hello.

23:25.545 --> 23:27.112
Yeah, I'm still here.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.947
I just said "hello," didn't I?

23:28.949 --> 23:30.615
Yeah.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.751
In the leg?

23:32.753 --> 23:35.754
Uh-huh. Okay.
Got it. Thanks.

23:35.756 --> 23:38.056
St. Irene's had a gunshot Vic
with a leg wound.

23:38.058 --> 23:39.190
Name?

23:39.192 --> 23:43.628
Dominic Carbone.

23:44.797 --> 23:47.098
Weapons possession,
drug possession,

23:47.100 --> 23:48.233
did a year at Rikers.

23:48.235 --> 23:50.402
Court case pending.

23:50.404 --> 23:52.270
Greatest hits list.

23:52.272 --> 23:54.205
Looks like a real rock star.

23:55.074 --> 23:57.308
Let's go.

23:59.111 --> 24:02.147
I told you,
I didn't do anything.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.581
You didn't do anything.

24:03.583 --> 24:05.216
So, how the hell'd you get
the bullet in your leg?

24:05.218 --> 24:07.552
I shot myself by accident
cleaning my gun.

24:07.554 --> 24:09.054
You got a permit
for that gun?

24:09.056 --> 24:10.755
Come on,
it's a bad neighborhood.

24:10.757 --> 24:11.890
Cut the crap, Dominic.

24:11.892 --> 24:13.258
DANNY: You want to
tell us why the hell

24:13.260 --> 24:14.392
you shot a cop?

24:14.394 --> 24:15.760
I didn't.

24:15.762 --> 24:17.462
- You didn't? - Uh-uh.
- So, who the hell did?

24:17.464 --> 24:20.365
You want me to have a bullet
in my head instead of my leg?

24:20.367 --> 24:21.800
Well, you shot a cop.

24:21.802 --> 24:23.668
You're lucky you don't have
a bullet in your head already.

24:23.670 --> 24:26.704
You know, the thing about birds,
you treat them right,

24:26.706 --> 24:28.239
take care of them like I do,

24:28.241 --> 24:29.841
they find their way home
every time.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.509
Mm-hmm. Is that right?

24:31.511 --> 24:33.645
The more you fly them,
the smarter they get.

24:33.647 --> 24:35.146
Well, it's too bad
you can't get any smarter,

24:35.148 --> 24:36.448
'cause we're gonna arrest you
for possession

24:36.450 --> 24:38.917
and then we're gonna confirm
it was you who shot a cop.

24:38.919 --> 24:40.552
You're not gonna see
these birds anymore.

24:40.554 --> 24:41.886
That is, unless
they're smart enough

24:41.888 --> 24:43.888
to come find your
dumb ass in prison.

24:43.890 --> 24:45.123
Get up. Put your hands
behind your back.

24:45.125 --> 24:47.625
Can I just do one thing first?
Hey!

24:47.627 --> 24:49.894
Please, can I just release
my birds?

24:50.763 --> 24:53.531
Go ahead. And don't try
anything stupid.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.133
Thank you.

25:07.746 --> 25:08.813
All right.

25:08.815 --> 25:10.548
Get over there.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.350
Look, I swear to God,
I didn't mean to hit that cop.

25:12.352 --> 25:14.552
(handcuffs tighten) The owner pulled a gun,
that's the only reason I fired.

25:14.554 --> 25:15.620
Right.

25:15.622 --> 25:18.156
I was on orders, bro.

25:18.158 --> 25:20.024
I'm not the bad guy here.
You shot a cop.

25:20.026 --> 25:21.593
Makes you a bad guy to us.

25:21.595 --> 25:22.894
Who gave you the orders?

25:23.896 --> 25:25.263
Who gave you the orders?!

25:25.265 --> 25:27.832
Victor Ruiz.

25:27.834 --> 25:29.234
He runs the Double Treys.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.235
And what do
the Double Treys

25:30.237 --> 25:31.636
have to do with
this massage parlor?

25:31.638 --> 25:33.972
The Warriors are selling
drugs out of that place

25:33.974 --> 25:35.373
and that's Trey territory.

25:35.375 --> 25:37.408
And you were supposed to go
there and try to stop them?

25:37.410 --> 25:38.543
Yeah.

25:38.545 --> 25:39.544
Do you recognize
this woman?

25:39.546 --> 25:41.613
DOMINIC:
(laughs) Oh, yeah.

25:41.615 --> 25:44.082
She's the drug courier.
Hold on.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.884
<i>She's</i> the drug courier?

25:45.886 --> 25:47.252
Good cover, right?

25:47.254 --> 25:49.487
Who's going to
suspect a granny?

26:01.627 --> 26:03.628
Biggest charge you
get on the job.

26:04.311 --> 26:05.545
Don't overthink it.

26:05.546 --> 26:07.379
First thing that comes to mind.
Uncle Jamie first.

26:07.381 --> 26:09.548
Uh, rescuing a kid from danger.

26:09.550 --> 26:11.116
Getting a rapist
off the streets.

26:11.118 --> 26:12.651
DANNY: Besides doing a
ride-along with my niece,

26:12.653 --> 26:15.654
uh, saving people's lives.

26:15.656 --> 26:17.189
Slapping the cuffs
on a murderer.

26:17.191 --> 26:18.524
HENRY:
And when you're a cop,

26:18.526 --> 26:20.059
it's never the same day twice.

26:20.061 --> 26:21.760
JAMIE:
No sitting behind a desk.

26:21.762 --> 26:23.262
No punching in
or punching out.

26:23.264 --> 26:25.664
Uncle Danny, I'm serious.

26:25.666 --> 26:26.999
Okay.

26:27.001 --> 26:30.903
I like the idea that I
would get to help people.

26:30.905 --> 26:32.805
ERIN: Okay,
so you guys want to stop

26:32.807 --> 26:34.139
sugarcoating it now?

26:34.141 --> 26:35.507
Nobody's sugarcoating it.

26:35.509 --> 26:36.475
Really?

26:36.477 --> 26:37.776
Yeah.

26:37.778 --> 26:38.811
'Cause I don't hear
anyone talking about

26:38.813 --> 26:40.179
the stinkers and the jumpers,

26:40.181 --> 26:41.847
the crack addicts

26:41.849 --> 26:43.215
and the child abusers.

26:43.217 --> 26:45.084
Not to mention,
the anticop sentiment

26:45.086 --> 26:47.386
that is your thank-you
these days.

26:47.388 --> 26:50.689
- So, you take the bad with the good.
- You're really gonna sit there

26:50.691 --> 26:52.458
and pretend that the job
doesn't take a toll?

26:52.460 --> 26:54.560
I didn't say the job
doesn't take a toll.

26:54.562 --> 26:55.761
Your job takes a toll, Mom.

26:55.763 --> 26:57.963
So, what's wrong
with being a cop?

26:57.965 --> 27:00.866
I never said there was anything
wrong with being a cop.

27:00.868 --> 27:02.534
You just don't want Nicky
to be a cop.

27:02.536 --> 27:05.437
No. I just want Nicky

27:05.439 --> 27:06.972
to look at
all her options

27:06.974 --> 27:09.441
and not go blindly joining
the family business.

27:09.443 --> 27:12.344
I am and this is one
of the options.

27:12.346 --> 27:15.547
And I'm just saying there are
plenty of ways to help people

27:15.549 --> 27:17.716
that don't put you
in harm's way.

27:20.820 --> 27:22.221
She has a point.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.989
It's different now.

27:23.991 --> 27:26.158
It's a different culture
than when we all got started.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.293
Back then, it was considered
an honor.

27:28.295 --> 27:29.394
And it still is.

27:29.396 --> 27:31.430
But?
It's not a but.

27:31.432 --> 27:33.732
No, please.

27:33.734 --> 27:36.602
All of these...

27:36.604 --> 27:40.272
gangsters and rapists
and murderers

27:40.274 --> 27:42.708
that you all get a charge
out of taking down,

27:42.710 --> 27:44.476
I prosecute them.
I put them away.

27:44.478 --> 27:46.478
And there's not one that
I wouldn't gladly see walk

27:46.480 --> 27:48.480
if it meant that...

27:50.250 --> 27:51.650
...if it meant that one of you

27:51.652 --> 27:53.385
would still be
sitting at this table

27:53.387 --> 27:56.655
and not lying somewhere
in a morgue.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.379
Look, I didn't mean to, um...

28:20.381 --> 28:21.780
You didn't?

28:21.782 --> 28:23.515
Yeah, I kind of did.

28:23.517 --> 28:27.853
Oh, our dinners really
aren't about eating.

28:27.855 --> 28:29.688
- I know.
- You hope the food's good,

28:29.690 --> 28:33.625
but... the connections
are why we gather.

28:33.627 --> 28:35.194
Yeah,

28:35.196 --> 28:38.096
but I pretty much
disconnected things.

28:38.098 --> 28:40.833
No. I mean, I went
through the same hoops

28:40.835 --> 28:43.035
when Jamie wanted
to join the department.

28:43.037 --> 28:47.439
Yeah, but you had just
lost a son to the job.

28:47.441 --> 28:49.775
And you had just
lost a brother.

28:49.777 --> 28:54.413
But you didn't stand
in Jamie's way.

28:54.415 --> 28:57.449
Well, I didn't think
it was my place.

28:57.451 --> 28:58.851
Not that I didn't feel it.

28:58.853 --> 29:00.819
And now?

29:00.821 --> 29:04.389
He made a choice.
I supported him.

29:04.391 --> 29:07.526
(sighs)

29:07.528 --> 29:09.061
But not Nicky?

29:09.063 --> 29:13.398
I'm not <i>not</i>
supporting Nicky.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.334
But there are pros
and cons to this job

29:15.336 --> 29:17.236
and the dinner table
is a chorus of pros,

29:17.238 --> 29:18.403
so it falls on me.

29:18.405 --> 29:20.005
Well, you put it
that way...

29:20.007 --> 29:21.573
She romanticizes it.

29:21.575 --> 29:22.741
How could she not?
You all do.

29:22.743 --> 29:25.410
Well, what is that
supposed to mean?

29:25.412 --> 29:26.979
Come on, Dad.

29:26.981 --> 29:28.714
It's a home team
advantage here.

29:28.716 --> 29:31.583
(sighs)
Look...

29:31.585 --> 29:33.418
I'm just trying
be supportive.

29:33.420 --> 29:35.754
Like you were when I
wanted to take the exam?

29:35.756 --> 29:39.458
Now, I regret that.

29:39.460 --> 29:41.026
You do?
- Yeah.

29:41.028 --> 29:44.029
I wish I'd taken a stronger
stand with your mother,

29:44.031 --> 29:47.532
but she was dead set
against you joining.

29:47.534 --> 29:49.034
Why do you think that was?

29:49.036 --> 29:50.302
Same reasons you have.

29:50.304 --> 29:51.870
Not exactly.

29:54.340 --> 29:58.043
I begged her to
take that stance.

30:02.448 --> 30:03.682
You did?

30:03.684 --> 30:05.517
I knew the job
wasn't for me,

30:05.519 --> 30:07.185
but I didn't want
to disappoint you.

30:07.187 --> 30:11.156
(sighs) Oh.

30:11.158 --> 30:12.791
And you didn't push it

30:12.793 --> 30:16.695
because someone you loved
and trusted asked you not to.

30:16.697 --> 30:19.464
Oh.

30:19.466 --> 30:22.968
So maybe you can give me
a little of that.

30:29.475 --> 30:31.843
(sighs)

30:35.581 --> 30:38.016
You testified that
your granddaughter

30:38.018 --> 30:39.584
was shot by the Double Treys.

30:39.586 --> 30:40.652
That's right.

30:40.654 --> 30:41.787
But you left out the part
that you were

30:41.789 --> 30:43.555
running drugs and cash
for The Warriors.

30:43.557 --> 30:45.314
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:45.338 --> 30:46.259
Sure you don't.

30:46.260 --> 30:48.460
We got a witness that says
you're the drug courier,

30:48.462 --> 30:49.895
so you can play dumb
all you want,

30:49.897 --> 30:51.330
but you're looking at
criminal possession

30:51.332 --> 30:53.165
and operating as a trafficker.

30:53.167 --> 30:54.166
That's 20 years.

30:54.168 --> 30:55.734
Unless you cooperate.

30:55.736 --> 30:57.970
Cooperate how?

30:57.972 --> 30:59.304
Bring us to the
drop-off, that's how.

30:59.306 --> 31:01.239
What do I get?

31:01.241 --> 31:03.241
ERIN: I won't charge
you for trafficking.

31:03.243 --> 31:05.043
You plead to possession
in the second degree.

31:05.045 --> 31:06.378
Three years.

31:06.380 --> 31:09.281
I walk out this door,
offer's off the table.

31:10.583 --> 31:13.051
Well, you can walk, honey,

31:13.053 --> 31:15.153
'cause you got nothin' on me.

31:15.155 --> 31:16.855
I never been arrested,

31:16.857 --> 31:18.924
I have no drugs on me,
and I'm guessing

31:18.926 --> 31:21.393
this witness is the guy
who shot at your cop, so...

31:21.395 --> 31:23.562
see you around.

31:28.835 --> 31:30.469
(door opens, slams)

31:34.907 --> 31:36.408
Hi.

31:36.410 --> 31:38.043
Please tell me that bag
has something other

31:38.045 --> 31:39.478
than green Jell-O in it.

31:39.480 --> 31:40.712
It does.

31:40.714 --> 31:43.482
Prosciutto, mozzarella,
roasted peppers

31:43.484 --> 31:45.684
on ciabatta with
extra balsamic.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.753
You are an angel.

31:47.755 --> 31:49.354
I met your ex-wife.

31:49.356 --> 31:50.622
Sorry about that.

31:50.624 --> 31:53.925
She blames me
for you being shot.

31:53.927 --> 31:56.028
That's okay. She blames me
for everything,

31:56.030 --> 31:58.030
including global warming.

31:58.032 --> 31:59.931
For the record, not your fault.

31:59.933 --> 32:01.900
Mmm.

32:01.902 --> 32:03.735
I am glad you're okay.

32:03.737 --> 32:05.604
Me, too.

32:05.606 --> 32:07.005
For Sophia's sake.

32:07.007 --> 32:09.841
She certainly is
daddy's little girl.

32:09.843 --> 32:11.043
You can tell that.

32:11.045 --> 32:13.779
- And I worked hard for that title.
- (laughs)

32:13.781 --> 32:16.281
Which is why this corruption
investigation,

32:16.283 --> 32:17.582
it's killing me.

32:17.584 --> 32:20.285
I'm really sorry
I put you in danger.

32:20.287 --> 32:21.620
You didn't put me in danger.

32:21.622 --> 32:23.388
I-I did, and I shouldn't
be so...

32:23.390 --> 32:25.290
What? Good at what you do?

32:25.292 --> 32:26.858
Care about your cases?

32:26.860 --> 32:28.960
Let me tell ya,

32:28.962 --> 32:31.363
when Sophia grows up, I
hope she's just like you.

32:31.365 --> 32:32.998
And not because
you're a hottie.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.667
A hottie.

32:35.669 --> 32:37.936
Not because you're good looking,

32:37.938 --> 32:39.471
but because you're smart,

32:39.473 --> 32:43.041
you know what you want,
you know how to go after it.

32:43.043 --> 32:44.876
And you're a good mom,

32:44.878 --> 32:47.312
'cause you taught Nicky
to be the same way.

32:54.954 --> 32:56.822
BAEZ:
<i>60 years old.</i>

32:56.824 --> 32:57.889
You'd think
she'd know better.

32:57.891 --> 32:59.558
She has to
make quick money.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.560
BAEZ: At 60, I
want to be living

33:01.562 --> 33:03.595
in a little house
on the beach in Aruba...

33:04.697 --> 33:06.164
...where I'm gonna
own a tiki bar

33:06.166 --> 33:07.599
that specializes

33:07.601 --> 33:09.801
in fancy drinks
and Puerto Rican food.

33:09.803 --> 33:11.570
Not something I would ever
peg you

33:11.572 --> 33:14.306
for being an owner of,
but sounds fun.

33:14.308 --> 33:16.975
Yeah. I'm gonna call it
"Tiki-Rican."

33:16.977 --> 33:18.410
Hmm...

33:18.412 --> 33:20.312
What about you?
- Eh, I don't...

33:20.314 --> 33:21.780
I don't go that far
into the future.

33:21.782 --> 33:24.850
Though I will say, I
hope that, on occasion,

33:24.852 --> 33:26.952
I'll be fortunate enough
to be sitting by your side

33:26.954 --> 33:28.653
at that tiki bar.

33:28.655 --> 33:30.188
I hope so, too.

33:31.724 --> 33:33.325
She's turning.

33:33.327 --> 33:35.193
Subject is turning left

33:35.195 --> 33:37.362
onto Meserole.

33:42.168 --> 33:44.436
Signal in the S.U.

33:45.505 --> 33:47.305
On three.

33:47.307 --> 33:48.507
One,

33:48.509 --> 33:49.508
two,

33:49.510 --> 33:50.809
three.

33:51.777 --> 33:52.844
Team out.

33:57.383 --> 33:59.851
Police department,
search warrant!

33:59.853 --> 34:01.353
(officers shouting)

34:01.355 --> 34:03.355
Move! Clear right!

34:03.357 --> 34:04.656
Flank left!

34:05.691 --> 34:06.758
Car is clear.

34:06.760 --> 34:07.993
(gunshots)

34:09.161 --> 34:10.996
OFFICER:
Man down, man down!

34:12.697 --> 34:13.831
It's okay.

34:13.833 --> 34:15.766
Hey, get him out of here!
Come on!

34:15.768 --> 34:16.735
We need a medic!
(gunshots)

34:16.737 --> 34:18.469
Go, go, go!

34:21.206 --> 34:22.940
Fan out, fan out!
Let's go.

34:22.943 --> 34:25.377
Move, move.
Move, come on.

34:25.379 --> 34:27.646
Right here. Over here!
(shouting)

34:27.648 --> 34:29.246
On the left!

34:44.630 --> 34:45.697
Baez!

34:46.699 --> 34:47.899
(shouts)

34:49.001 --> 34:50.869
(man groaning)

34:50.871 --> 34:52.204
Hey.

34:53.172 --> 34:53.938
Where's the other shooter?

34:53.940 --> 34:55.473
Anybody else here?

34:55.475 --> 34:57.108
Answer the question.
Yes.

34:57.110 --> 34:58.643
Where?
- To the left.

34:58.645 --> 35:00.812
Cuff him.

35:03.249 --> 35:04.382
Spread out.

35:04.384 --> 35:05.750
Go.

35:13.092 --> 35:15.327
OFFICER:
Over here.

35:20.433 --> 35:22.500
(panting)

35:28.774 --> 35:30.609
Granny.

35:30.611 --> 35:32.477
At your age? Really?

35:32.479 --> 35:34.079
You should've took that deal.

35:34.081 --> 35:35.247
Honey.

35:44.545 --> 35:45.578
Hi.

35:45.580 --> 35:46.580
Hey.

35:47.106 --> 35:49.473
So I got a call
from the C.O.

35:49.475 --> 35:51.208
to report to One PP
on Monday morning.

35:51.210 --> 35:52.943
- Me, too.
- What's it about?

35:52.945 --> 35:54.244
I don't know

35:54.246 --> 35:56.480
Aren't you supposed
to have some sort of insight?

35:56.482 --> 35:58.282
I didn't hear
anything on my end.

35:58.284 --> 36:00.384
- Well...
- Two, please.

36:00.386 --> 36:02.619
(sighs) Do you think we could be
in even more trouble?

36:02.621 --> 36:05.689
No, I mean, we already
got suspended for a week.

36:05.691 --> 36:08.558
Could we please get some,
uh, fortune cookies?

36:08.560 --> 36:10.227
Thank you.

36:10.229 --> 36:12.162
Usually, they bring those
at the end.

36:12.164 --> 36:13.630
I know. I don't want
to have to wait.

36:13.632 --> 36:16.500
So, what are you gonna
do with your time off?

36:16.502 --> 36:18.235
I'm just gonna work
on the Chevelle.

36:18.237 --> 36:20.237
I'm taking kickboxing classes.

36:20.239 --> 36:21.571
Twice a day.

36:21.573 --> 36:23.407
I'm gonna look amazing
at the end of the week.

36:23.409 --> 36:24.541
What, no dates?

36:24.543 --> 36:26.043
Mm, nope.

36:26.045 --> 36:28.378
Taking some me time.

36:28.380 --> 36:29.947
Thank you.
- Thanks.

36:29.949 --> 36:32.149
So, did you ever find out
why you got blown off?

36:32.151 --> 36:33.583
I did.

36:33.585 --> 36:36.219
What, you're not gonna tell me?

36:36.221 --> 36:38.822
Okay, fine. It's because of you.

36:38.824 --> 36:39.957
Me?

36:39.959 --> 36:41.158
Apparently,
I talk about you too much,

36:41.160 --> 36:42.726
and it made him
feel inferior, I guess.

36:42.728 --> 36:44.995
Well, I see how I could make
other guys feel inferior.

36:44.997 --> 36:48.131
Do you see why
I didn't want to tell you?

36:48.133 --> 36:49.166
I'm kidding.

36:49.168 --> 36:50.300
Well, I didn't know
that talking

36:50.302 --> 36:51.668
about work and my partner...

36:51.670 --> 36:53.303
Your brave and handsome partner.

36:53.305 --> 36:54.972
(exhales)

36:55.907 --> 36:58.208
...was gonna be such a turnoff.

36:59.711 --> 37:01.244
It's ridiculous.

37:01.246 --> 37:02.846
It's ridiculous.

37:06.484 --> 37:08.585
"The greatest risk
is not taking one."

37:08.587 --> 37:10.487
Between the sheets.
- What?

37:10.489 --> 37:11.688
You're supposed to add
"between the sheets"

37:11.690 --> 37:13.290
to the end of the fortune
in a fortune cookie.

37:13.292 --> 37:14.524
You know, for fun,

37:14.526 --> 37:16.526
so yours would be, "The greatest
risk is not taking one

37:16.528 --> 37:17.527
between the sheets."

37:17.529 --> 37:19.229
(chuckling):
Okay.

37:19.231 --> 37:20.263
So what's yours?

37:20.265 --> 37:23.200
"Your partner
will make you very happy"

37:23.202 --> 37:24.368
between the sheets.

37:24.370 --> 37:25.836
It does not say that.
That's what it says.

37:25.838 --> 37:26.870
You're lying.
Give it to me.

37:26.872 --> 37:27.904
"Your partner will
make you very happy."

37:27.906 --> 37:29.006
Show me.
You can't read my fortune.

37:29.008 --> 37:31.375
- It's not a wish.
- Yeah, it's like a wish.

37:31.377 --> 37:32.709
If I eat it,
it makes it real.

37:32.711 --> 37:34.311
That's not how that works.

37:37.849 --> 37:40.917
We're just a couple of regular
P.O.s here to talk to you today.

37:40.919 --> 37:43.320
And we know you've met
a lot of bosses in suits

37:43.322 --> 37:46.056
and brass in uniforms
and a lot of bars and stripes.

37:46.058 --> 37:47.257
Well, that's not us.

37:47.259 --> 37:48.425
Yeah, we're just cops.

37:48.427 --> 37:50.227
And the odds are,
if you're lucky enough

37:50.229 --> 37:52.362
to join this department,
you'll be one of us.

37:52.364 --> 37:54.097
And that story we
told you about Billy,

37:54.099 --> 37:55.298
cops do that.

37:55.300 --> 37:56.266
Regular cops.

37:56.268 --> 37:57.267
JAMIE:
And sometimes,

37:57.269 --> 37:59.436
cops have to make
a judgment call

37:59.438 --> 38:02.139
that gets them jammed up
with the brass and the bosses.

38:02.141 --> 38:03.974
JANKO: Like us.
Reason we're here,

38:03.976 --> 38:07.277
we pulled a suspension
for insubordination.

38:07.279 --> 38:09.513
(murmuring)
JAMIE: Which happened while we were trying

38:09.515 --> 38:10.480
to help out Billy.

38:10.482 --> 38:12.282
Which was the
right thing to do.

38:12.284 --> 38:15.118
And the risky thing,
as it turns out.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.253
We made a judgment call.

38:16.255 --> 38:17.521
We'd do it again.

38:17.523 --> 38:19.523
Risk isn't always
about facing down a gun,

38:19.525 --> 38:21.291
sometimes it's about
helping someone in trouble

38:21.293 --> 38:22.893
so they don't end up
in more trouble.

38:22.895 --> 38:24.428
That's a risk worth taking.

38:24.430 --> 38:25.962
Because you saved Billy's life.

38:25.964 --> 38:28.231
Maybe. We'll never
know for sure.

38:28.233 --> 38:29.499
JAMIE:
But maybe.

38:29.501 --> 38:30.934
And at the end of the day,
that's as good a reason

38:30.936 --> 38:32.969
as any for becoming a cop.
- Yeah.

38:32.971 --> 38:35.338
Okay, kids,
it's time to move on.

38:35.340 --> 38:37.107
(all moaning)
But no worries,

38:37.109 --> 38:39.876
I'm gonna schedule
Officer Reagan and Janko

38:39.878 --> 38:41.578
to come back
and talk to you again.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.180
But now that you heard

38:43.182 --> 38:45.348
the real deal
from our uniformed officers,

38:45.350 --> 38:48.652
how many of you are thinking
about becoming cops?

38:50.455 --> 38:52.923
Wow. That's fantastic.

38:52.925 --> 38:55.325
On that note,
Lieutenant Dubrowski is gonna

38:55.327 --> 38:57.060
take you down to
the CompStat room.

38:57.062 --> 38:58.462
Thank you for coming.

38:58.464 --> 39:00.730
GIRL: Thank you.
(applause)

39:02.100 --> 39:04.835
Wow. You two could take
this show on the road.

39:04.837 --> 39:06.937
Rather just take it back out
on the beat, Lieutenant.

39:06.939 --> 39:09.206
These kids, that's the best
response we've ever gotten.

39:09.208 --> 39:10.974
Well, glad we
could help, boss.

39:10.976 --> 39:13.009
Maybe it's a good idea, letting
them hear from regular cops.

39:13.011 --> 39:15.479
Wow. That's exactly
what your old man said

39:15.481 --> 39:17.147
when he ordered it up.

39:21.652 --> 39:23.687
Ah, I guess we do work
pretty well together, huh?

39:23.689 --> 39:25.155
Between the sheets.

39:25.157 --> 39:27.624
(laughing):
You're ridiculous.

39:27.626 --> 39:30.494
Then she told the prince, if
he was really interested in her,

39:30.496 --> 39:32.762
he'd have to wait for her
to come ck from college.

39:32.764 --> 39:35.432
And then, they could talk
about getting married.

39:35.434 --> 39:38.335
And then, she told him,
he better do something else

39:38.337 --> 39:42.005
other than being a prince,
'cause that ain't a real job.

39:42.007 --> 39:43.573
Maybe he should be a cop.

39:43.575 --> 39:44.674
Maybe he should.

39:44.676 --> 39:45.809
DANNY:
If you ask me,

39:45.811 --> 39:47.777
Prince Charming would make
one heck of a cop.

39:47.779 --> 39:49.312
I mean,
that's some detective work.

39:49.314 --> 39:52.249
Finding the only girl in town
who happened to lose one shoe.

39:52.251 --> 39:56.052
Sophia, honey, wait outside
for a minute, okay?

39:56.054 --> 39:57.521
Actually, I'm gonna be brief.

39:57.523 --> 39:59.422
So, she might as well stay.

39:59.424 --> 40:01.992
I came by

40:01.994 --> 40:03.960
to tell your dad
that the man who shot him

40:03.962 --> 40:06.696
is from a really,
really bad drug gang.

40:06.698 --> 40:08.298
But because your dad

40:08.300 --> 40:09.733
was so brave,

40:09.735 --> 40:12.068
we were able to catch
every single one

40:12.070 --> 40:13.570
of those bad guys.

40:13.572 --> 40:15.138
And put them in jail?

40:15.140 --> 40:16.506
That's the plan.

40:16.508 --> 40:18.542
Anyway,
D.O.I. is closing

40:18.544 --> 40:21.411
their corruption investigation,
and in fact, uh,

40:21.413 --> 40:24.214
looks like you'll be receiving
a commendation from the DA.

40:24.216 --> 40:25.715
I knew it!

40:25.717 --> 40:27.417
ABETEMARCO: Let me
ask you something.

40:27.419 --> 40:29.953
Erin said you wanted
this case. Why?

40:29.955 --> 40:32.289
Well, 'cause even though
you happen to work

40:32.291 --> 40:35.292
for the DA's office,
you're still a brother in blue.

40:35.294 --> 40:38.028
Well, thank you, brother.

40:38.030 --> 40:39.729
Anytime.

40:39.731 --> 40:40.997
So, uh...

40:42.266 --> 40:44.000
Going forward, maybe we could
bury the hatchet.

40:44.002 --> 40:45.335
Tell you what,

40:45.337 --> 40:47.437
you stop poaching my cases,
we'll bury the hatchet.

40:47.439 --> 40:48.605
Not gonna happen.

40:48.607 --> 40:49.873
That's my job.

40:49.875 --> 40:51.241
Well, then, that's a no.

40:51.243 --> 40:52.342
Bye.

40:52.344 --> 40:53.510
Bye.

40:53.512 --> 40:55.812
Don't wave to him.

41:07.525 --> 41:08.858
Hey.

41:10.695 --> 41:13.330
Did you come all the way
out here just for me?

41:13.332 --> 41:17.734
Well, I was in the neighborhood.

41:17.736 --> 41:20.337
Thanks, Grandpa.

41:20.339 --> 41:22.172
You're always there for me.

41:23.274 --> 41:24.507
ERIN:
Hey.

41:24.509 --> 41:25.709
How'd it go?

41:27.945 --> 41:29.646
Hey.

41:29.648 --> 41:31.848
Hey.

41:33.951 --> 41:36.052
Okay, I think.

41:36.054 --> 41:37.520
Just okay?

41:37.522 --> 41:39.923
Actually, I nailed it.

41:39.925 --> 41:41.891
Good.

41:41.893 --> 41:44.794
Now we have some bragging rights
at the dinner table.

41:48.633 --> 41:52.636
And you didn't take that test
just to see how you stack up?

41:52.638 --> 41:55.405
Not at all.

41:59.977 --> 42:04.014
Whatever I end up doing, I
respect the family business.

42:04.016 --> 42:05.749
I hope you know that.

42:09.053 --> 42:14.557
And whatever you end up doing,
I respect your choice.

42:14.559 --> 42:16.426
I hope you know that.

42:18.296 --> 42:21.197
I do.

42:23.367 --> 42:25.702
So what's next?

42:27.338 --> 42:29.005
How about lunch?

42:30.341 --> 42:32.375
You free?

42:33.177 --> 42:35.578
I am.

42:36.414 --> 42:39.149
Lights and sirens.

42:45.189 --> 42:47.624
FRANK:
Let me in here, will you?
