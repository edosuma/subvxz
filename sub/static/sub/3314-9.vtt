WEBVTT

00:13.394 --> 00:16.977
(phone buzzing)

00:21.482 --> 00:23.143
(typing)

00:23.144 --> 00:24.854
EXCUSE ME?

00:24.855 --> 00:28.238
I... I WAS NOT
CHECKING MY PHONE.

00:28.239 --> 00:30.200
YES YOU WERE. YEAH.

00:30.201 --> 00:32.532
I'M WORKING HARD OVER
HERE AND YOU'RE TEXTING?

00:32.533 --> 00:35.915
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HEARD THE
BUZZ AND I HAD TO CHECK.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.657
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS DRIVING.

00:37.658 --> 00:41.251
ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?

00:41.252 --> 00:43.293
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A
VERY INTIMATE MOMENT HERE

00:43.294 --> 00:46.256
AND YOU ARE... YOU ARE
CHECKING YOUR PHONE.

00:46.257 --> 00:47.627
OKAY, I'M SORRY, JOE.

00:47.628 --> 00:48.928
IT'S JUST I'M A
CITY COUNCILWOMAN.

00:48.929 --> 00:51.721
YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE OF
TOLEDO HAVE ME ON CALL 24/7,

00:51.722 --> 00:53.843
AND THAT TEXT COULD HAVE
BEEN VERY IMPORTANT.

00:53.844 --> 00:55.265
AND WAS IT?

00:55.266 --> 01:00.230
THAT DEPENDS ON HOW IMPORTANT
CAT VIDEOS ARE TO YOU.

01:00.231 --> 01:02.562
LOOK. LOOK IT KEEPS PAWING
AT ITS OWN REFLECTION.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.063
SEE, 'CAUSE IT THINKS
IT'S ANOTHER CAT.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.856
ISN'T THAT SO... SOMETHING
I CAN WATCH LATER?

01:06.857 --> 01:09.739
OKAY, UH, LOOK, ALL
RIGHT, I'M SORRY.

01:09.740 --> 01:12.532
I AM PUTTING THIS AWAY,
AND I AM 100% YOURS.

01:12.533 --> 01:14.364
NOW, WHERE WERE WE?

01:14.365 --> 01:16.956
NO. NO, I MEAN I...
YOU KNOW, I...

01:16.957 --> 01:18.828
I CAN'T GO BACK. YOU
KNOW, I LOST MY PLACE.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.201
I DON'T... YOU KNOW, I WOULD
NEVER DO ANYTHING TO YOU

01:21.202 --> 01:22.622
LIKE WHAT YOU JUST DID TO ME.

01:22.623 --> 01:24.294
- OH, IS THAT SO?
- OH, THAT IS VERY SO.

01:24.295 --> 01:26.296
UH, NEED I REMIND YOU
OF A CERTAIN NIGHT

01:26.297 --> 01:28.968
WHEN OUR ROLES WERE REVERSED,
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THINGS,

01:28.969 --> 01:30.970
YOU WERE WATCHING
THE SUPER BOWL.

01:30.971 --> 01:33.513
THAT WAS A PREARRANGED
FANTASY, AS SPECIFIED

01:33.514 --> 01:38.268
BY THE CONDITIONS ON THE VALENTINE'S
DAY COUPON THAT YOU GAVE ME!

01:38.269 --> 01:42.142
LOOK, ADMIT IT, YOU ARE AS
EASILY DISTRACTED AS I AM.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.984
NO, NO, NOT WHEN I'M
IN BED WITH MY WIFE.

01:44.985 --> 01:46.356
OKAY? ALL RIGHT,
WHEN I AM IN HERE,

01:46.357 --> 01:48.188
I AM LIKE LASER FOCUSED, MAN.

01:48.189 --> 01:49.989
MY MOM COULD BE AT THE
FOOT OF THIS BED,

01:49.990 --> 01:52.992
GETTING RIPPED LIMB FROM LIMB
BY RABID COYOTES, ALL RIGHT?

01:52.993 --> 01:55.114
AND I GOT MY EYE ON THE PRIZE.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.578
CAN WE JUST MAYBE MOVE ON?

01:58.579 --> 02:01.120
(sighs) FINE.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.952
I MEAN, I CAN TRY...

02:02.953 --> 02:04.954
(phone buzzing)

02:04.955 --> 02:08.458
OKAY, I'LL JUST TURN THAT OFF.

02:08.459 --> 02:11.050
AWW!

02:11.051 --> 02:14.554
YOU KNOW WHAT? I HOPE YOU
ENJOY THAT CAT VIDEO.

02:14.555 --> 02:16.807

02:50.881 --> 02:53.253
LADIES, EYES UP HERE, OKAY?

02:53.254 --> 02:54.964
YOU KNOW, I MIGHT BE
KIND OF OLD-SCHOOL,

02:54.965 --> 02:56.426
BUT MY IDEA OF A SATURDAY-MORNING
FAMILY BREAKFAST

02:56.427 --> 02:58.848
INVOLVES EYE CONTACT

02:58.849 --> 03:01.351
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
HUMAN INTERACTION.

03:01.352 --> 03:03.433
I'M HAVING LOTS OF
HUMAN INTERACTION

03:03.434 --> 03:05.435
WITH MY 806 FRIENDS.

03:05.436 --> 03:08.017
YOU ONLY HAVE 806 FRIENDS?

03:08.018 --> 03:09.520
(sing-song) LOSER.

03:11.021 --> 03:13.403
THOSE AREN'T FRIENDS.
NOBODY HAS 806 FRIENDS.

03:13.404 --> 03:15.945
OH YEAH? WELL, I HAVE
3,000 FOLLOWERS.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.988
LENNOX, IF 3,000 PEOPLE
WERE FOLLOWING YOU,

03:18.989 --> 03:20.820
IT WOULD BE TERRIFYING, OKAY?

03:20.821 --> 03:23.823
FRIENDS, FOLLOWERS? COME ON, IT'S LIKE
ALL WORDS HAVE LOST THEIR MEANING.

03:23.824 --> 03:26.085
WHO NEEDS WORDS WHEN
YOU HAVE EMOJIS?

03:26.086 --> 03:29.208
I CAN'T BELIEVE MIRIAM POSTED
THIS PHOTO OF ME EATING RAMEN.

03:29.209 --> 03:33.092
I WAS MID-SLURP. NOT EVEN JENNIFER
LAWRENCE LOOKS GOOD MID-SLURP.

03:33.093 --> 03:35.044
OH, I'M SORRY, JOE.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

03:35.045 --> 03:37.467
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T SEE
ME, 'CAUSE I WAS HIDING

03:37.468 --> 03:38.888
RIGHT HERE IN REAL LIFE.

03:38.889 --> 03:40.430
I SAID I'M SORRY.

03:40.431 --> 03:42.101
LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT
LAST NIGHT TOO, OKAY?

03:42.102 --> 03:44.013
- GIVE ME A KISS.
- (phone beeps)

03:44.014 --> 03:45.805
OOH!

03:45.806 --> 03:48.227
CLEARLY YOU'RE
OVERCOME WITH REMORSE.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.939
I AM. ONE SECOND...

03:49.940 --> 03:51.981
AND SEND.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.314
YOU KNOW YOU'RE TETHERED TO THAT
THING LIKE AN UMBILICAL CORD.

03:54.315 --> 03:57.026
JOE, WE NEED THESE, OKAY?
WE NEED TO BE CONNECTED.

03:57.027 --> 03:59.740
NOT EVERY SINGLE INTIMATE
MOMENT OF OUR LIVES.

04:01.912 --> 04:03.913
I'M TALKING ABOUT BREAKFAST.

04:03.914 --> 04:06.286
Both: OH.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.918
YOU KNOW WHAT? I BET THIS FAMILY

04:08.919 --> 04:10.920
COULDN'T GO THE WHOLE WEEKEND
WITHOUT LOOKING AT THOSE PHONES.

04:10.921 --> 04:13.833
I COULD, BUT WHAT ABOUT MY HOMEWORK?
I HAVE TO GO ONLINE TO GET IT.

04:13.834 --> 04:16.926
LAST NIGHT YOU SAID YOU HAD
NO ASSIGNMENTS THIS WEEKEND.

04:16.927 --> 04:19.379
THANKS SO MUCH.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.971
OH, I SEE WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

04:21.972 --> 04:24.183
HEY, LOOK, I'M NOT TELLING ANYONE
TO THROW THEIR PHONES AWAY.

04:24.184 --> 04:26.596
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T
BE ADDICTED TO THESE THINGS.

04:26.597 --> 04:27.937
EVERYTHING IN MODERATION.

04:27.938 --> 04:29.439
UM, WHAT ABOUT YOU
AND WORKING OUT?

04:29.440 --> 04:31.311
DON'T GO OFF-TOPIC.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.942
THAT WAS REALLY
WONDERFUL, HONEY.

04:32.943 --> 04:35.355
YOU'VE GIVEN US A LOT TO
THINK ABOUT, YOU KNOW?

04:35.356 --> 04:39.949
- (beeps) -SIRI, REMIND ME TO
THINK ABOUT WHAT JOE JUST SAID.

04:39.950 --> 04:41.741
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO.

04:41.742 --> 04:43.953
EVERYBODY REMEMBER OUR
LITTLE SWEAR JAR UP HERE

04:43.954 --> 04:44.994
THAT'S FULL OF QUARTERS?

04:44.995 --> 04:47.246
AH, THAT (jackhammer
pounding) THING.

04:47.247 --> 04:49.118
(jackhammer continues)

04:49.119 --> 04:51.711
SERIOUSLY? THE BUCHWALDS
ARE DOING CONSTRUCTION

04:51.712 --> 04:52.912
ON THE (jackhammer
rattles) WEEKEND?

04:52.913 --> 04:54.914
HEY!

04:54.915 --> 04:58.339
SH... (jackhammer rattles)!
IT'S 9:00 IN THE MORNING!

05:01.512 --> 05:03.012
AREN'T YOU GOING TO
GET SOME CHANGE?

05:03.013 --> 05:04.804
OH, NO, THEY'RE GOING TO
BE DOING CONSTRUCTION

05:04.805 --> 05:06.766
ON THAT POOL FOR A LONG TIME.

05:06.767 --> 05:08.638
OKAY, HERE'S THE
DEAL, ALL RIGHT?

05:08.639 --> 05:10.430
ANYONE WHO MAKES IT
TILL MONDAY MORNING

05:10.431 --> 05:13.272
WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEIR PHONE
WILL GET EVERYTHING IN THIS JAR.

05:13.273 --> 05:14.394
(laughs)

05:14.395 --> 05:16.896
PLUS $200 FROM MY WALLET.

05:16.897 --> 05:18.197
- I'M IN.
- ME TOO.

05:18.198 --> 05:20.490
ARE YOU GOING TO
LOCK UP OUR PHONES?

05:20.491 --> 05:22.201
WE'RE NOT LOCKING ANYTHING UP.

05:22.202 --> 05:24.744
WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE GOING ON THE
HONOR SYSTEM. MEL, ARE YOU IN?

05:24.745 --> 05:26.366
ARE YOU GOING TO GUILT
ME TO DEATH IF I SAY NO?

05:26.367 --> 05:28.618
COME ON, WOULD I EVER
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

05:28.619 --> 05:30.620
I'M IN.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.754
GOOD, ALL RIGHT. SO THE
CLOCK STARTS RIGHT NOW.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.416
(phone dings)

05:36.417 --> 05:39.839
OH! OH, CAN YOU DELAY THE
CLOCK JUST, LIKE, ONE MINUTE?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.011
NO, I'M SORRY, THAT'S
NOT HOW TIME WORKS.

05:42.012 --> 05:43.883
BUT, JOE, THIS GUY MIGHT
BE ASKING ME OUT.

05:43.884 --> 05:45.595
ASKING YOU OUT? OKAY,
GO AHEAD AND TEXT HIM.

05:45.596 --> 05:48.728
AND LENNOX LASTED
ALMOST ONE MINUTE.

05:48.729 --> 05:51.931
NO! NO, I WANT THAT MONEY.

05:51.932 --> 05:54.974
GOOD. OKAY, SO NO TEXTS,

05:54.975 --> 05:57.236
NO EMAILS, NO BROWSING
THE INTERNET,

05:57.237 --> 05:59.859
NO CUTE LITTLE ANIMALS OR BABIES
PLAYING IN SPAGHETTI, ALL RIGHT?

05:59.860 --> 06:00.940
FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

06:00.941 --> 06:02.782
YOU THINK YOU CAN
DO THIS TOO, JOE?

06:02.783 --> 06:04.984
PFF! ARE YOU KIDDING?
GIVE ME A PARTY HAT,

06:04.985 --> 06:07.117
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING
TO BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

06:08.829 --> 06:11.040
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I
LOVE MY PHONE, MAN,

06:11.041 --> 06:13.874
BUT NOT MORE THAN I LOVE THE
PEOPLE AROUND ME. YOU KNOW?

06:15.796 --> 06:17.917
I MEAN, EVERYBODY PRETENDS, YOU
KNOW, PHONES ARE FOR CONNECTING.

06:17.918 --> 06:21.000
RIGHT? MY THEORY IS, THEY USE
THESE PHONES TO AVOID PEOPLE.

06:21.001 --> 06:22.632
BECAUSE YOU REALLY
WANT TO CONNECT, MAN,

06:22.633 --> 06:24.173
YOU DISCONNECT FROM YOUR PHONE,

06:24.174 --> 06:26.175
AND YOU CONNECT TO THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU!
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:26.176 --> 06:27.927
YOU TALK TO THEM,
YOU LISTEN TO THEM.

06:27.928 --> 06:29.308
- YOU KNOW, JOE...
- I'M NOT DONE YET.

06:29.309 --> 06:31.140
I WAS AT THE COFFEE SHOP
YESTERDAY, ALL RIGHT?

06:31.141 --> 06:33.933
IT'S FILLED WITH THESE COUPLES WHO
ARE NOT TALKING TO EACH OTHER.

06:33.934 --> 06:35.515
YEAH, IT'S A SAD STATE OF...

06:35.516 --> 06:37.106
SHH! I GOT THE ANSWER.

06:37.107 --> 06:39.939
RIGHT? THIS MORNING, I
CHALLENGED MY FAMILY

06:39.940 --> 06:42.191
TO NOT USE THEIR SCREENS
FOR THE ENTIRE WEEKEND.

06:42.192 --> 06:44.113
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY
INTERACT LIKE HUMAN BEINGS

06:44.114 --> 06:45.695
INSTEAD OF LIKE 'BOTS.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.577
- YOU DID THAT?
- YEAH, I DID, MAN.

06:47.578 --> 06:49.288
YOU KNOW? AND I'M TURNING THIS
WHOLE THING AROUND, ALL RIGHT?

06:49.289 --> 06:50.910
STARTING AT HOME. AND I'LL TELL
YOU SOMETHING RIGHT NOW, MORRIS.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.411
IF EVERYBODY DID THAT,

06:52.412 --> 06:55.034
WE COULD CHANGE THIS WHOLE
COUNTRY IN 48 HOURS.

06:55.035 --> 06:57.707
RIGHT, NOW I WANT YOU TO
STRETCH OUT YOUR HAMMIES.

06:57.708 --> 06:58.918
OKAY.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.920
WOW, I GOTTA SAY, JOE,

07:00.921 --> 07:03.753
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A
VERY PERSUASIVE GUY.

07:03.754 --> 07:06.546
REALLY? OH, YOU KNOW, I JUST SAY
WHAT I THINK AND WHAT I FEEL.

07:06.547 --> 07:08.888
I SPEAK FROM WHAT I LIKE
TO CALL MY HEART-BRAIN.

07:08.889 --> 07:10.890
HEART-BRAIN.

07:10.891 --> 07:12.972
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,
BUT I LOVE THE SOUND OF IT.

07:12.973 --> 07:15.434
DO YOU? I'M FULL OF
IDEAS LIKE THAT.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.727
YOU KNOW, I BOOK
SPEAKERS FOR CONVENTIONS

07:17.728 --> 07:19.859
AND CORPORATE RETREATS,
AND I REALLY THINK

07:19.860 --> 07:21.941
PEOPLE WOULD BE INTERESTED
IN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.983
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
BEING A MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER?

07:23.984 --> 07:25.775
YOU MEAN HAVE I THOUGHT
ABOUT TALKING PASSIONATELY

07:25.776 --> 07:28.027
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WHILE AN
AUDIENCE HANGS ON MY EVERY WORD?

07:28.028 --> 07:29.619
UM, YEAH.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.531
ONLY, LIKE, ALL THE TIME.

07:31.532 --> 07:34.163
YOU THINK YOU COULD PUT TOGETHER
A 45-MINUTE PRESENTATION?

07:34.164 --> 07:36.666
I COULD CUT IT DOWN
TO 45 MINUTES.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.167
WHY DON'T YOU PUT
SOMETHING TOGETHER,

07:38.168 --> 07:39.959
AND I'LL SEND A
CONTRACT OVER LATER.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.381
AND WHEN I GET AN OPENING,
I'LL TRY YOU OUT.

07:42.382 --> 07:44.794
ALL RIGHT, THAT SOUNDS GOOD, MAN.
THANK YOU.

07:44.795 --> 07:46.385
ALL RIGHT, NOW LET'S GET
YOU INTO THE GARAGE.

07:46.386 --> 07:47.927
WE'RE GONNA DO SOME
SQUATS WHILE I TELL YOU

07:47.928 --> 07:49.800
HOW I'M GONNA FIX THE
NATION'S SCHOOLS.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.516
HEY, MEL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA...

07:56.517 --> 07:59.689
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU...
ARE YOU MEDITATING?

07:59.690 --> 08:01.941
YES, I OMMMMM.

08:01.942 --> 08:03.983
JUST A LITTLE MEDITATION HUMOR.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.106
I DO THAT EVERY NOW AND ZEN.

08:07.157 --> 08:08.658
ANY MORE?

08:08.659 --> 08:09.869
NO, I'M DONE.

08:09.870 --> 08:11.871
IT TURNS OUT, WITHOUT
THE INTERNET,

08:11.872 --> 08:13.873
I HAVE ALL THIS EXTRA
TIME I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD.

08:13.874 --> 08:16.786
AND I GOTTA SAY, MEDITATING
MAKES YOU FEEL PRETTY GREAT.

08:16.787 --> 08:21.000
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE TRYING
ON SHOES FOR YOUR MIND.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.382
SO WAIT A MINUTE. BY CUTTING
YOU OFF FROM YOUR ELECTRONICS,

08:23.383 --> 08:25.795
I'VE JUST GIVEN YOU A WHOLE
NEW OUTLOOK ON YOUR LIFE.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.797
THAT'S WHY I CAME
IN HERE, HONEY,

08:27.798 --> 08:30.760
BECAUSE I WAS JUST TELLING MY CLIENT
MORRIS ABOUT OUR TECH-FREE WEEKEND,

08:30.761 --> 08:32.932
AND IT TURNS OUT HE ARRANGES
SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS

08:32.933 --> 08:35.685
AND HE WANTS TO HIRE NONE
OTHER THAN JOE LONGO.

08:35.686 --> 08:37.897
OH, WOW, I'M SO
HAPPY FOR YOU, JOE.

08:37.898 --> 08:39.639
OOH, AND I KNOW JUST
HOW WE CAN CELEBRATE.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.021
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT DURING
MY MEDITATION. SHUT THE DOOR.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.024
OOH, OKAY.

08:46.446 --> 08:49.108
NOW YOU AND ME...

08:49.109 --> 08:53.913
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
SECRET PHONE TIME?

08:53.914 --> 08:55.244
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

08:55.245 --> 08:57.206
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
A LITTLE JOE-MANCE.

08:57.207 --> 08:58.918
OKAY, I TOLD YOU NEVER
TO USE THAT WORD AGAIN.

08:58.919 --> 09:01.330
BESIDES, WE CAN DO THAT ANYTIME,

09:01.331 --> 09:03.963
BUT WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO CHECK OUR
EMAILS BEFORE THE KIDS NOTICE WE'RE GONE.

09:03.964 --> 09:06.836
- WE ALL MADE A PACT.
- I LEARNED MY LESSON.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.048
DON'T I DESERVE A DIGITAL QUICKIE?
THE KIDS DON'T HAVE TO KNOW.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.170
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU'VE
COMPLETELY LEARNED YOUR LESSON.

09:11.171 --> 09:13.552
OKAY OKAY OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DIDN'T LEARN MY LESSON,

09:13.553 --> 09:14.884
'CAUSE WE'RE ADULTS.

09:14.885 --> 09:17.386
IT'S TOO LATE FOR US
TO LEARN LESSONS.

09:17.387 --> 09:19.268
LOOK, MEL, I KNOW
IT'S HARD, ALL RIGHT,

09:19.269 --> 09:20.730
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW IF YOU'RE
GOING TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING

09:20.731 --> 09:21.851
UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY
ACCOMPLISH IT.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.683
OOH.

09:23.684 --> 09:27.316
THAT'S A GOOD LINE. I GOTTA
USE THAT FOR MY SPEECH.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.948
I'M SORRY, OKAY,
ANYWAY, BACK TO YOU.

09:28.949 --> 09:31.951
THE POINT IS, HONEY, I KNOW YOU
CAN ABSTAIN FROM USING THAT PHONE

09:31.952 --> 09:33.783
FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

09:33.784 --> 09:36.696
OKAY, FINE, YOU CONVINCED ME.

09:36.697 --> 09:38.497
I CAN DO THIS.

09:38.498 --> 09:40.499
SEE WHAT I JUST DID RIGHT THERE.

09:40.500 --> 09:43.292
I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING, I'M LIKE
A NATURAL MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER.

09:43.293 --> 09:44.624
I MEAN, I PSYCH YOU UP, BABY.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.005
I MOVE YOU FORWARD, ALL RIGHT?

09:46.006 --> 09:47.877
I MAKE YOU BECOME THE
BEST VERSION OF YOU...

09:47.878 --> 09:50.470
OKAY, STOP. YOU'RE MOTIVATING
ME TO JUMP OUT THE WINDOW.

09:52.673 --> 09:54.884
OKAY, I'M GOING TO
BE THE RACE CAR,

09:54.885 --> 09:57.476
DANI'S GOING TO BE THE HAT,
LENNOX IS GOING TO BE THE DOG,

09:57.477 --> 10:00.019
- AND AS USUAL, MEL IS GOING TO BE...
- All: THE SHOE.

10:00.020 --> 10:01.560
YOU LEARN FAST.

10:01.561 --> 10:04.934
EDUCATED GUESS. ZAPPOS JUST
SENT HER A SHOT GLASS.

10:04.935 --> 10:07.777
LOOK AT US. LOOK
AT US HERE, HUH?

10:07.778 --> 10:09.939
WE'RE CONNECTING AND
NOT USING ANY SCREENS.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.111
- MEL?
- Mel: I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.443
OH, HEY, DANI?

10:14.444 --> 10:15.865
EVERYONE GETS $2500.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.787
NO, THEY DON'T. CHECK THE RULES.

10:17.788 --> 10:20.369
AUNT MEL TORE UP THE RULES
LAST TIME WE PLAYED.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.791
WELL, THEN LOOK THEM UP ONLINE.

10:21.792 --> 10:23.162
NO, NO, NO. NO, REMEMBER?

10:23.163 --> 10:25.044
NOBODY'S GOING
ONLINE UNTIL MONDAY.

10:25.045 --> 10:26.375
YEAH, BUT JOE, WE NEED RULES.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.837
WELL, I'M NOT PLAYING UNLESS
WE'RE PLAYING CORRECTLY.

10:27.838 --> 10:30.009
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO PLAY
THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

10:30.010 --> 10:31.460
I WANTED TO PLAY SCRABBLE.

10:31.461 --> 10:33.963
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER
BECAUSE WE CHOSE THIS...

10:33.964 --> 10:36.135
- (Lennox and Dani shouting) -WE CHOSE THIS
GAME, AND WE'RE GONNA PLAY THIS GAME!

10:36.136 --> 10:37.807
AW, YOU GUYS STARTED
YELLING WITHOUT ME.

10:37.808 --> 10:40.309
BUT THAT'S MY FAVORITE
PART OF FAMILY GAME NIGHT.

10:40.310 --> 10:42.852
WE'RE NOT YELLING, HONEY.
WE'RE CONNECTING...

10:42.853 --> 10:44.523
VERY LOUDLY.

10:44.524 --> 10:45.935
YEAH, WELL, CHECK THIS OUT, JOE.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.817
A MESSENGER JUST DROPPED OFF
SOME CONTRACTS FOR YOU TO SIGN.

10:47.818 --> 10:49.318
IT'S FOR YOUR
SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT.

10:49.319 --> 10:51.941
- THAT WAS FAST. AWESOME!
- YEAH.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.233
- READ THE NOTE ON THE COVER.
- OH.

10:54.234 --> 10:56.445
"JOE, A SPEAKER GOT SICK
AND I HAVE AN OPENING

10:56.446 --> 10:59.949
"FOR TOMORROW. TEXT ME
IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE."

10:59.950 --> 11:00.831
THAT'S SWEET!

11:00.832 --> 11:02.912
- I'M GONNA GO...
- WHAT?

11:02.913 --> 11:04.744
WHAT, JOE? WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA GO DO?

11:04.745 --> 11:07.047
I'M GONNA...

11:08.919 --> 11:12.211
I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IT.

11:12.212 --> 11:14.884
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO TEXT HIM BACK?

11:14.885 --> 11:19.098
NO. NO, I'M NOT, BECAUSE I'M NOT
GOING TO VIOLATE MY PLEDGE.

11:19.099 --> 11:21.972
YOU KNOW? THERE'LL BE OTHER
SPEAKING OPPORTUNITIES.

11:24.514 --> 11:26.605
WOW, THEY REALLY PAY A
LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS.

11:26.606 --> 11:27.937
REALLY? YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.398
DOESN'T MATTER, ALL RIGHT?

11:29.399 --> 11:30.980
MONEY... MONEY DOESN'T
MATTER, OKAY?

11:30.981 --> 11:32.271
BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT
PRINCIPLE, MEL.

11:32.272 --> 11:35.695
AND AFTER ALL, WHO ARE WE
WITHOUT OUR PRINCIPLES?

11:37.868 --> 11:40.240
(typing)

11:41.912 --> 11:43.744
(beeping)

11:50.460 --> 11:52.211
THIS IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.923
WELL, WELL, WELL.

11:53.924 --> 11:57.636
THE ROLE MODEL IS CAUGHT
TEXTING IN THE CLOSET.

11:57.637 --> 11:59.428
DOES THIS SERIOUSLY LOOK
LIKE I'M TEXTING TO YOU?

11:59.429 --> 12:01.430
ALL RIGHT? BECAUSE THAT IS NOT
WHAT I'M DOING, ALL RIGHT?

12:01.431 --> 12:04.013
WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS I'M LOOKING
UP MORRIS'S CONTACT INFO.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.645
- IN THE CLOSET?
- I DON'T HAVE IT ANYWHERE ELSE.

12:06.646 --> 12:09.018
BESIDES, IF PEOPLE SAW
ME USING MY PHONE,

12:09.019 --> 12:10.900
THEY'D THINK I WAS
ACTUALLY TEXTING.

12:10.901 --> 12:12.852
I MEAN, YOU JUST DID.

12:12.853 --> 12:16.025
RELAX, JOE. I WON'T
TELL ANYBODY.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.357
LENNOX, THERE IS NOTHING
TO TELL HERE, ALL RIGHT?

12:18.358 --> 12:20.159
BUT THANK YOU.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.530
LET ME FINISH.

12:21.531 --> 12:23.322
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT YOUR TEXTING

12:23.323 --> 12:25.164
IF YOU DON'T TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT MY THREE TEXTS.

12:25.165 --> 12:27.917
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE. I DID
ONE TEXT. WHY DO YOU GET THREE TEXTS?

12:27.918 --> 12:30.039
OH, HEY, IF THAT'S A PROBLEM,
I CAN JUST GO TELL AUNT MEL

12:30.040 --> 12:31.211
ABOUT YOUR CLOSET AFFAIRS.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.295
WELL, I DEFINITELY
WOULDN'T WORD IT THAT WAY.

12:36.546 --> 12:39.378
ALL RIGHT, FINE. FINE,
YOU GET THREE TEXTS.

12:39.379 --> 12:41.140
AND YOU LOOK SO INNOCENT.

12:41.141 --> 12:42.972
AH, FINALLY!

12:42.973 --> 12:44.934
I CAN USE MY THUMBS
THE WAY GOD INTENDED.

12:44.935 --> 12:46.847
(typing)

12:57.607 --> 12:59.820
- (typing)
- (cat meows)

13:03.033 --> 13:04.533
(clears throat)

13:04.534 --> 13:06.996
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED!
THE PHONE FELL INTO MY HANDS.

13:06.997 --> 13:08.327
OH, YOU'RE NOT JOE.

13:08.328 --> 13:09.909
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
TELL HIM, ARE YOU?

13:09.910 --> 13:11.961
TELL JOE WHAT?

13:11.962 --> 13:15.044
OH, YOU'RE BAD...
IN THE GOOD WAY.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.047
MOVE OVER.

13:22.923 --> 13:26.555
AH, LOOK AT ME! I WAS ABOUT TO
PLUG IN MY PHONE TO RECHARGE IT,

13:26.556 --> 13:28.848
BUT SINCE I DIDN'T USE
IT TODAY, NO NEED.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.980
BECAUSE YOUR WORDS
MOTIVATED ME, JOE.

13:30.981 --> 13:33.192
YOU KNOW, THANKS FOR BEING
SUCH A GOOD ROLE MODEL.

13:33.193 --> 13:34.984
YEAH, YEAH. YOU
KNOW, LISTEN, MEL,

13:34.985 --> 13:36.525
I ACTUALLY HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

13:36.526 --> 13:37.897
THIS WHOLE NO-CELL-PHONE
CHALLENGE

13:37.898 --> 13:39.608
WAS A LOT HARDER THAN I
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE,

13:39.609 --> 13:41.401
AND THE TRUTH IS, HONEY...

13:42.993 --> 13:44.533
I BARELY MADE IT
THROUGH THE FIRST DAY.

13:44.534 --> 13:45.865
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.746
I MEAN, THOSE SCREENS
ARE SO TEMPTING.

13:47.747 --> 13:48.868
YEAH, THEY REALLY
ARE, SO TEMPTING.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.329
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, BABY?
YOU JUST GOTTA BE STRONG.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.620
SO STRONG.

13:51.621 --> 13:53.042
WELL, I GOTTA GET TO SLEEP

13:53.043 --> 13:54.753
BECAUSE I GOTTA GET UP EARLY.

13:54.754 --> 13:56.165
I HAVE MY FIRST SPEAKING
ENGAGEMENT TOMORROW.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.627
OH, YOU GOT THE GIG?
CONGRATULATIONS.

13:58.628 --> 13:59.959
THANKS. YEAH, I'M REALLY
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.961
WOW, THAT'S AWESOME.

14:01.962 --> 14:04.263
WAIT A MINUTE, I'M CONFUSED.

14:04.264 --> 14:07.226
UM, HOW DID YOU BOOK
THIS GIG FOR TOMORROW?

14:07.227 --> 14:09.469
HUH?

14:10.810 --> 14:12.681
I MEAN, WITHOUT
USING YOUR PHONE,

14:12.682 --> 14:14.473
LIKE, HOW DID YOU GET
IN TOUCH WITH HIM?

14:14.474 --> 14:18.817
DID YOU USE SOME SORT OF, I
DON'T KNOW, HOGWARTS OWL?

14:18.818 --> 14:22.361
(laughs) GOOD ONE.
YOU'RE HILARIOUS.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.074
I'M FALLING ASLEEP RIGHT NOW.
GOOD NIGHT.

14:25.075 --> 14:26.986
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
BROKE YOUR PLEDGE.

14:26.987 --> 14:28.697
YOU TEXTED HIM!

14:28.698 --> 14:30.749
ALL WHILE I'M MAKING
THIS HUGE SACRIFICE.

14:30.750 --> 14:33.452
HUGE SACRIFICE! YOU MISSED
OUT ON A DAY OF CAT VIDEOS.

14:33.453 --> 14:35.544
YEAH, JOE! A WHOLE DAY!

14:35.545 --> 14:36.996
YOU KNOW WHAT, JOE?

14:36.997 --> 14:39.128
- KNOCK KNOCK.
- WHO'S THERE?

14:39.129 --> 14:41.710
HYPOCRITE. YOU'RE
A BIG HYPOCRITE.

14:41.711 --> 14:43.923
THAT'S NOT EVEN THE CORRECT
FORM OF A KNOCK-KNOCK JOKE.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.385
OH YEAH? KNOCK KNOCK, WHO CARES?

14:46.386 --> 14:49.929
LISTEN, GIVING THIS SPEECH IS
NOT JUST ABOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?

14:49.930 --> 14:51.931
IT'S ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE
TO LEAD BETTER LIVES.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.723
IT'S NOT SO HARD, JOE. JUST
ADMIT WHAT YOU DID WAS WRONG.

14:54.724 --> 14:57.686
OKAY, FINE, I'LL ADMIT THAT WHAT
I DID WAS SLIGHTLY INCONSISTENT.

14:57.687 --> 14:59.858
UH, INCONSISTENT
WITH BEING RIGHT?

14:59.859 --> 15:03.322
WHATEVER! ALL RIGHT, I SAID ONE
THING AND THEN DID ANOTHER!

15:03.323 --> 15:04.903
THAT IS THE DEFINITION
OF A HYPOCRITE.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.156
YOU KNOW WHAT? SOME OF THE
MOST EFFECTIVE MEN IN HISTORY

15:07.157 --> 15:08.988
HAVE BEEN BIG HYPOCRITES
IN THEIR PERSONAL LIFE.

15:08.989 --> 15:11.830
- THAT'S YOUR DEFENSE?
- I DON'T KNOW!

15:11.831 --> 15:13.622
IS IT WORKING?

15:13.623 --> 15:15.834
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
YOU'RE CHECKING TEXTS,

15:15.835 --> 15:16.875
DANI'S CHECKING EMAILS.

15:16.876 --> 15:18.537
WHOA WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.
BACK UP.

15:18.538 --> 15:19.959
DANI CHEATED?

15:19.960 --> 15:21.880
I DID NOT TELL YOU THAT.

15:21.881 --> 15:23.802
BUT YOU KNOW, AT LEAST SHE WASN'T
CLAIMING TO BE A ROLE MODEL.

15:23.803 --> 15:25.674
ALL RIGHT.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.676
HEY, LOOK, LET'S
JUST END THIS NOW.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.928
WE SHOULDN'T GO TO BED ANGRY.
IT'S NOT GOOD TO GO TO BED ANGRY.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.720
ALL RIGHT? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT...

15:31.721 --> 15:33.812
I THINK I GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING

15:33.813 --> 15:35.264
THAT WILL HELP YOU RELAX,

15:35.265 --> 15:38.767
MAYBE EVEN, YOU KNOW,
HELP YOU SLEEP BETTER.

15:38.768 --> 15:40.769
MMM. SO DO I.

15:40.770 --> 15:43.652
- MMM.
- HOT, HOT CAT VIDEOS.

15:43.653 --> 15:46.615
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO WATCH THEM, BECAUSE
SOMEONE IN THIS HOUSE HAS RESTRAINT.

15:46.616 --> 15:49.029
OH, OH, OH, HEY, LOOK! IT'S ME!

15:59.209 --> 16:01.380
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:01.381 --> 16:03.382
SHOULDN'T YOU BE ON YOUR WAY TO
YOUR BIG SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT?

16:03.383 --> 16:05.964
MEL, HOW CAN I GO OUT THERE
IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE

16:05.965 --> 16:08.137
AND TELL THEM TO DO SOMETHING
THAT I COULDN'T DO?

16:08.138 --> 16:09.888
HOW WOULD I FEEL ABOUT MYSELF?

16:09.889 --> 16:11.890
ANSWER? NOT GREAT.

16:11.891 --> 16:14.053
LOOK, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ALL
THOSE THINGS I SAID LAST NIGHT.

16:14.054 --> 16:16.055
NO, HONEY, YOU WERE RIGHT.

16:16.056 --> 16:17.476
I WAS BEING A TOTAL HYPOCRITE.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.897
NO, YOU WERE RIGHT.

16:18.898 --> 16:19.938
AND YOU WERE RIGHT FIRST.

16:19.939 --> 16:22.521
I DO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME
STARING AT MY PHONE,

16:22.522 --> 16:24.653
BECAUSE IT'S EASY,

16:24.654 --> 16:26.445
AND REAL INTERACTION IS HARD,

16:26.446 --> 16:29.198
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
TO YOUR HUSBAND FOR OVERREACTING.

16:29.199 --> 16:31.780
LOOK, SURE, YOU'RE NOT PERFECT,

16:31.781 --> 16:34.283
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WHAT
YOU HAVE TO SAY ISN'T VALUABLE,

16:34.284 --> 16:36.075
AND IT'LL BE VALUABLE
TO THAT AUDIENCE TOO.

16:36.076 --> 16:37.246
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

16:37.247 --> 16:38.827
OF COURSE I DO.

16:38.828 --> 16:40.879
YOU'RE FULL OF GOOD IDEAS,
BETWEEN LONGO FIT AND THIS,

16:40.880 --> 16:42.751
YOU SHOULD REALLY WRITE A BOOK.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.713
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT DOING THAT?

16:44.714 --> 16:46.545
YOU MEAN, HAVE I EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT EXPRESSING MYSELF

16:46.546 --> 16:49.469
WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED FOR 200 PAGES?
UM, YEAH.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.262
- ONLY, LIKE, ALL THE TIME.
- WELL, THEN DO IT.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.684
BUT FIRST YOU SHOULD GET GOING SO
YOU'RE NOT LATE TO YOUR SPEECH.

16:55.685 --> 16:57.556
THOSE PEOPLE ARE
COUNTING ON YOU.

16:57.557 --> 17:00.689
OH MY GOD. YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT.

17:00.690 --> 17:01.850
AGAIN.

17:01.851 --> 17:03.562
NOT THAT I'M KEEPING TRACK.

17:03.563 --> 17:04.943
WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU?

17:04.944 --> 17:06.445
- MWAH!
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK.

17:06.446 --> 17:08.148
YEAH! THANK YOU.

17:11.411 --> 17:14.533
WAIT, SO WHICH ONE OF YOU IS
THE MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.955
WELL, ME, BUT I CAN'T
PURSUE ALL OF MY TALENTS

17:16.956 --> 17:19.329
OR THE REST OF THE WORLD
WOULD JUST GET JEALOUS.

17:21.831 --> 17:23.662
HEY THERE, FAMILY.

17:23.663 --> 17:25.254
OH, LOOK WHO'S HOME.

17:25.255 --> 17:27.666
- HOW'D THE SPEECH GO, JOE?
- IT WENT AMAZING.

17:27.667 --> 17:29.338
A LOT OF PEOPLE CAME UP
TO ME AFTER THE SPEECH

17:29.339 --> 17:31.340
AND TOLD ME JUST HOW
INSPIRED THEY WERE.

17:31.341 --> 17:34.553
ACTUALLY, ONE GUY... HE GOT OUT
OF HIS WHEELCHAIR TO THANK ME.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.176
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING
TO TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT,

17:37.177 --> 17:41.140
BUT YOU CAN'T CALL
IT A COINCIDENCE.

17:41.141 --> 17:43.021
WOW.

17:43.022 --> 17:45.774
I NEED A MOMENT AFTER THAT ONE.

17:45.775 --> 17:47.566
ANYWAY, THE COOLEST THING
IS THAT A FEW PEOPLE

17:47.567 --> 17:49.188
ACTUALLY CAME UP TO ME
AFTER I WAS DONE TALKING,

17:49.189 --> 17:50.569
AND THEY ASKED ME IF
THEY COULD BUY MY BOOK.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.691
- AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- I SAID, "PRE-ORDER IT RIGHT NOW

17:52.692 --> 17:55.154
"BECAUSE AS IT HAPPENS,
I'M WRITING ONE."

17:55.155 --> 17:56.575
THAT'S GREAT, JOE.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.287
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? PUT ME
DOWN FOR A PRE-ORDER TOO.

17:58.288 --> 18:01.870
ME TOO. BUT CAN I GET
MINE IN AN E-BOOK?

18:01.871 --> 18:02.911
ABSOLUTELY.

18:02.912 --> 18:04.753
YOU SEE? I'M NOT
ANTI-TECHNOLOGY.

18:04.754 --> 18:07.005
AND ALSO, IF I'M GOING
TO GET IT IN AN E-BOOK,

18:07.006 --> 18:10.470
I'M ALSO GOING TO NEED AN E-BOOK
READER WITH A LEATHER CASE.

18:12.262 --> 18:13.802
YOU WANT ME TO READ
YOUR BOOK, DON'T YOU?

18:13.803 --> 18:16.175
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. OKAY?

18:16.176 --> 18:18.387
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU GUYS, I
COULD NOT HAVE DONE ANY OF IT

18:18.388 --> 18:19.978
WITHOUT THIS LOVELY
LADY HERE TODAY.

18:19.979 --> 18:21.890
I MEAN, SHE IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAD THE CONVICTION

18:21.891 --> 18:23.312
AND THE CHARACTER TO
STICK IT OUT, YOU KNOW,

18:23.313 --> 18:25.894
AND NOT LOOK AT A
PHONE OR A SCREEN

18:25.895 --> 18:27.726
OR SEND A SINGLE TEXT.

18:27.727 --> 18:28.937
I MEAN, I CRACKED, YOU KNOW?

18:28.938 --> 18:30.729
- LENNOX CRACKED.
- HEY!

18:30.730 --> 18:32.321
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO OUT ME.

18:32.322 --> 18:34.404
- BUT DON'T YOU FEEL BETTER NOW?
- NO.

18:36.656 --> 18:38.997
DON'T FEEL BAD, OKAY?
DANI CRACKED TOO.

18:38.998 --> 18:40.619
WHAT? I DID NOT.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.040
DANI, MEL TOLD ME.

18:42.041 --> 18:44.203
- BUT SHE WAS THE ONE...
- DANI, IT IS RUDE

18:44.204 --> 18:46.206
TO INTERRUPT YOUR FATHER
WHEN HE'S SPEAKING.

18:48.418 --> 18:49.709
FINE.

18:51.961 --> 18:53.922
WAIT, WHY'D YOU DO THAT? YOU
DIDN'T SAY ANY SWEAR WORDS.

18:53.923 --> 18:58.136
YEAH, BUT I'LL BE SAYING
PLENTY LATER IN MY BEDROOM.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.809
AND SO... CAN I HAVE THAT
JAR, PLEASE, SWEETIE?

19:00.810 --> 19:03.021
PER OUR AGREEMENT...

19:03.022 --> 19:04.523
MEL...

19:04.524 --> 19:06.185
YOU GET THE WINNINGS.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.727
- OH.
- AW.

19:08.728 --> 19:10.819
WOW. YOU KNOW, I WASN'T
EXPECTING TO WIN,

19:10.820 --> 19:12.271
SO I DIDN'T PREPARE A SPEECH.

19:12.272 --> 19:14.033
THAT'S OKAY, NO ONE
WANTS TO HEAR ONE.

19:15.325 --> 19:17.035
CONGRATULATIONS, MEL.

19:17.036 --> 19:19.618
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH
THAT BIG PILE OF CASH YOU WON...

19:19.619 --> 19:23.041
FAIRLY AND SQUARELY?

19:23.042 --> 19:26.124
UH, WELL, I'M NOT...
I'M NOT SURE YET.

19:26.125 --> 19:28.547
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO HAND
IT TO YOU, AUNT MEL,

19:28.548 --> 19:31.049
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BE ABLE
TO SURVIVE THE DEPRAVATION.

19:31.050 --> 19:34.052
JEEZ, I WISH I HAD
YOUR DISCIPLINE.

19:34.053 --> 19:36.555
SEE, GIRLS, IT JUST
GOES TO SHOW YOU,

19:36.556 --> 19:38.797
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE
THIS WOMAN RIGHT HERE.

19:38.798 --> 19:42.892
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE SHE IS CAPABLE
OF SO MUCH MORE THAN WE KNOW.

19:43.853 --> 19:46.935
ALL RIGHT! I CHEATED TOO.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.437
OKAY, I WATCHED KITTENS
VERSUS DUCKLINGS,

19:48.438 --> 19:51.770
AND IT WAS ADORABLE. YOU
KNOW, WE ALL CHEATED,

19:51.771 --> 19:54.112
SO NOBODY DESERVES THIS
MONEY FROM THE SWEAR JAR.

19:54.113 --> 19:55.904
WE ARE GIVING IT TO CHARITY.

19:55.905 --> 19:59.078
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS HOUSE
CHEATS LIKE (jackhammer pounding).

20:02.872 --> 20:06.164
WELL, WELL, WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT
BACK ON THE TECHNOLOGY SAUCE, HUH?

20:06.165 --> 20:09.167
I SURE AM, BUT, YOU SEE, I AM
USING THE COMPUTER FOR GOOD NOW.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.999
BECAUSE I CLEARED MY
SCHEDULE OUT FOR THE DAY

20:11.000 --> 20:13.422
SO I COULD SIT DOWN AND
START TO WRITE MY BOOK.

20:13.423 --> 20:15.464
OH, GOOD FOR YOU. HOW MANY
PAGES HAVE YOU WRITTEN?

20:15.465 --> 20:18.007
I JUST SAT DOWN.

20:18.888 --> 20:21.099
BUT I THOUGHT I HEARD
YOU WAKE UP HOURS AGO.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.101
YEAH, YOU DID, BUT YOU
KNOW, I HAD TO WORK OUT,

20:23.102 --> 20:25.103
AND THEN, OF COURSE, I HAD TO GET
DANI'S LUNCH READY FOR SCHOOL,

20:25.104 --> 20:26.725
AND THEN I STARTED THE
MARINADE AND THEN,

20:26.726 --> 20:28.727
YOU KNOW, I NEVER NOTICED
HOW MESSY THE PANTRY WAS,

20:28.728 --> 20:30.108
SO OF COURSE, I HAD
TO CLEAN THAT OUT.

20:30.109 --> 20:32.271
BUT NOW... NOW I AM FOCUSED

20:32.272 --> 20:35.694
AND READY TO START WORK
ON MY BEST SELLER.

20:35.695 --> 20:37.816
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU FOR SITTING
DOWN AND TACKLING THAT.

20:37.817 --> 20:40.569
AND YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER HAD
A BOOK DEDICATED TO ME,

20:40.570 --> 20:42.951
IN CASE YOU WANTED
TO CHANGE THAT.

20:42.952 --> 20:45.824
BUT I'LL JUST GO NOW
AND LET YOU FOCUS.

20:45.825 --> 20:47.626
OKAY? FOCUS, JOE, FOCUS!

20:47.627 --> 20:49.668
- GIVE ME A "J"!
- MEL.

20:49.669 --> 20:51.039
I GOT IT.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.873
- BYE.
- HEY, WHOOP!

20:55.214 --> 20:57.005
- (door closes)
- (sighs)

20:57.006 --> 20:58.968
OKAY.

21:12.812 --> 21:15.485
I THINK I DESERVE A BREAK.

21:18.398 --> 21:20.108
- (kitten meowing)
- LOOK AT THAT.

21:20.109 --> 21:23.031
(laughing) KITTEN
NURSING ON A GORILLA.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.705
OH, MAN, NATURE'S CRAZY.
