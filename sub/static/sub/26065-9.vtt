assistance.

to me?

04:53.759 --> 04:56.762
[Candice]<i> Rick couldn't pay</i>

04:59.165 --> 05:01.733
- He's your son too.
- I know he's my son.

05:03.436 --> 05:04.703

[Carl]<i> We believe</i>
<i>he just didn't wanna pay...</i>

05:17.116 --> 05:19.028

He didn't want anything

05:19.052 --> 05:20.963

[Lynnanne]<i> With Rick</i>

05:26.259 --> 05:27.993
[Kenneth]<i> Sonia was the one</i>
<i>who was working.</i>

05:28.060 --> 05:29.795
Rick was staying with her
and she appeared

05:29.862 --> 05:31.908
to be fronting
a lot of the bills.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.843
[Lynnanne]<i> Sonia</i>
<i>doesn't blame Rick</i>

05:33.867 --> 05:35.934
<i>for the situation.</i>

05:36.001 --> 05:39.338
It's hopeless.
Debbie's out to destroy me.

05:39.405 --> 05:41.873
[Lynnanne]<i> Instead, they unite</i>

05:41.941 --> 05:43.875
<i>against a common enemy.</i>

05:43.943 --> 05:45.544
[Carl]<i> He's saying</i>
<i>that if Debbie</i>

05:45.611 --> 05:46.923
was causing all
of their problems

05:46.947 --> 05:48.391
that they would be
so much better off

05:48.415 --> 05:51.216
if Debbie weren't around.

05:51.283 --> 05:53.151
[Bill]<i> And she began</i>
<i>to believe, "Okay.</i>

06:10.770 --> 06:12.204
Now you're talking.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.174
We can post this all

06:22.848 --> 06:24.616

That's right, yes.

06:41.801 --> 06:44.469
No, I'd like to stay anonymous.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.449
[Carl]<i> Sonia tried</i>

[Kenneth]<i> Everything</i>
<i>to make sure that</i>

[suspenseful music playing]

07:35.922 --> 07:39.635
Yeah, I'm fine.
Um, I'm sorry about that.

07:39.659 --> 07:41.193

It'll be over

07:44.531 --> 07:46.843
Okay. All righty then.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.400
[Kenneth] She told
one of her friends,

[Kenneth]<i> And that was</i>
<i>looming over Rick's head.</i>

09:31.204 --> 09:33.649
<i>They viewed this as doomsday.</i>

09:33.673 --> 09:37.609
[Lynnanne]<i> And there's</i>
<i>only one person to blame.</i>

09:37.676 --> 09:39.388
[Carl]<i> If they got rid</i>
<i>of Debbie,</i>

09:39.412 --> 09:41.146
their life would be blissful.

09:41.213 --> 09:43.281
That all their problems
would go away

09:43.349 --> 09:45.283
and everything would be great.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.154
You know...

09:51.490 --> 09:54.737
if only Debbie
would disappear...

09:54.761 --> 09:56.895
[Bill]<i> I believe</i>
<i>that Rick put that idea</i>

09:56.962 --> 09:59.675
to kill Debra in Sonia's head.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.299
[Kenneth]<i> This was</i>
<i>something that,</i>

10:01.367 --> 10:03.435
<i>you know, Rick was trying
to manipulate her</i>

10:03.502 --> 10:04.836
<i>into doing.</i>

10:04.903 --> 10:06.905
I have an idea.

10:06.972 --> 10:08.884
[Bill]<i> And she told Rick</i>
<i>that, "I have an idea."</i>

10:08.908 --> 10:10.620
And it will be concrete

10:10.644 --> 10:13.044
and it will solve
their problems.

10:13.112 --> 10:16.247
Wait, you don't mean
what I think you mean?

10:16.315 --> 10:18.961
Yeah.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.986
You can't be serious.

10:21.053 --> 10:23.966
What are our options?

10:23.990 --> 10:25.635
[Candice]<i> I think</i>
<i>Rick manipulated her</i>

10:25.659 --> 10:27.125
but her heart was in it.

10:29.729 --> 10:32.842
[Lynnanne]<i> In the early hours</i>
<i>of November 7th,</i>

10:32.866 --> 10:35.700
<i>the day before Rick
is due in court.</i>

10:38.871 --> 10:41.784
<i>Sonia uses Rick's son's key</i>

10:41.808 --> 10:44.453
<i>to gain entry to Debbie's house.</i>

10:44.477 --> 10:47.145
[Candice]<i> She saw Debbie</i>
<i>as an obstacle</i>

10:47.212 --> 10:48.991
to her future happiness

10:49.015 --> 10:50.548
and nothing was gonna stop her.

10:50.616 --> 10:53.618

11:06.899 --> 11:08.633
[Lynnanne]
<i>She finds Debbie asleep</i>

11:08.701 --> 11:10.201
<i>in front of the television.</i>

11:13.972 --> 11:15.384
[Kenneth]
<i>She was dressed for bed,</i>

11:15.408 --> 11:16.819
Sonia crept in a point in time

11:16.843 --> 11:18.376
when she was asleep.

11:26.986 --> 11:29.298
[Bill] She stood on the side
and the shotgun

11:29.322 --> 11:31.389
would have been put right up
to her face.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.795
[gunshot]

11:36.862 --> 11:39.330
[Kenneth]<i> It was one shot</i>
<i>at pointblank range.</i>

11:41.333 --> 11:44.736
[Carl] I don't know
why she was so enraged

11:44.803 --> 11:46.705
that she could do such a thing.

11:49.742 --> 11:52.744
[suspenseful music playing]

11:58.283 --> 12:01.219
[Lynnanne]<i> Sonia's cruelty</i>
<i>doesn't stop there.</i>

12:01.286 --> 12:03.132
<i>She knows full well</i>

12:03.156 --> 12:05.534
<i>that Debbie's 12-year-old son</i>

12:05.558 --> 12:07.959
<i>will be coming home
to that house</i>

12:08.026 --> 12:10.228
<i>after school.</i>

12:10.295 --> 12:11.741
[Bill]<i> He was coming back</i>
<i>to Debra</i>

12:11.765 --> 12:13.364
<i>after spending
the weekend with Rick.</i>

12:13.432 --> 12:14.944
So he rode the bus home

12:14.968 --> 12:18.481
and got home
sometime after 4:00.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.372
[Kenneth]<i> Mom's car was there</i>
<i>which was unusual.</i>

12:21.440 --> 12:23.308
[Bill]<i> Called out to his mom.</i>

12:23.375 --> 12:26.222
<i>She didn't answer.</i>

12:26.246 --> 12:28.847
So he walked in,
turned the light on.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.582
[Kenneth]<i> It was a very,</i>

12:30.649 --> 12:32.784
<i>very grizzly scene.</i>

12:39.859 --> 12:41.926
I can't understand

12:41.994 --> 12:44.440
why a person let a child...

12:44.464 --> 12:46.531
<i>Why she would let him
find her like that.</i>

12:46.598 --> 12:49.567
<i>It's beyond my comprehension.</i>

12:51.871 --> 12:54.984
[Candice] <i>She let that happen.</i>

12:55.008 --> 12:56.719
[handcuffs clinking]

12:56.743 --> 13:00.923
[Lynnanne]<i> Suspicion</i>
<i>immediately falls on Rick.</i>

13:00.947 --> 13:02.792
[Carl]<i> They wanted to know</i>
<i>if we knew of anybody</i>

13:02.816 --> 13:04.994
<i>that might wanna harm Debbie</i>

13:05.018 --> 13:07.663
and we told them

13:07.687 --> 13:10.533
we knew one person.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.957
[Lynnanne]<i> But when</i>
<i>investigators examine</i>

13:13.025 --> 13:14.359
<i>Rick's phone,</i>

13:14.426 --> 13:17.195
<i>they find a new prime suspect.</i>

13:19.565 --> 13:22.967
<i>Rick has secretly
been recording conversations</i>

13:23.035 --> 13:26.771
<i>that depict Sonia
as a cold-blooded killer.</i>

13:28.707 --> 13:30.152
[Bill] Rick wanted
that information

13:30.176 --> 13:32.955
in case we started
looking at him.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.279
So...

13:36.248 --> 13:37.849
tell me more.

13:37.916 --> 13:40.051
This weekend.

13:40.118 --> 13:41.853
What about then?

13:41.920 --> 13:44.189
[Bill]<i> So we would realize</i>
<i>that he didn't kill her</i>

13:44.256 --> 13:46.324
<i>- but Sonia did.</i>
- [Kenneth]<i> Rick was talking</i>

13:46.391 --> 13:48.193
to her about have
you ever hurt anything a day

13:48.260 --> 13:50.639
in your life?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.331
You've never killed
anything in your life.

13:53.398 --> 13:54.443
I mean, try killing your cat,

13:54.467 --> 13:56.201
you'll see it's not so easy.

13:56.268 --> 13:57.913
Sonia's response was,
"The cats don't deserve it."

13:57.937 --> 13:59.982
Cat doesn't deserve it.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.673
But Debbie does.

14:04.543 --> 14:07.679
[Lynnanne]<i> A jury finds</i>
<i>Sonia Weidenfelder</i>

14:07.746 --> 14:10.593
<i>and Rick Spaulding

<i>Both are convicted
of first-degree murder.</i>

14:15.554 --> 14:18.734

[Carl]<i> When we heard</i>

14:30.302 --> 14:32.170
They really were gonna get
what they deserved.

14:32.237 --> 14:33.972
You got a little something here.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.773
[Lynnanne] <i>In the name of love,</i>

14:35.841 --> 14:39.777
<i>Sonia was willing
to sacrifice Debra's life.</i>

14:39.845 --> 14:41.579
<i>A devoted mother</i>

14:41.647 --> 14:44.582
<i>who had a beautiful
future ahead.</i>

14:44.650 --> 14:45.783
[Bill]<i> She didn't have</i>
<i>any remorse</i>

14:45.851 --> 14:47.385
<i>for what she did.</i>

14:47.452 --> 14:49.365
I think that she did that
with the thought that

14:49.389 --> 14:51.022
that was the right thing to do.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.693
[Candice]<i> Sonia wanted Rick</i>
<i>at all cost.</i>

14:57.062 --> 15:00.509
<i>And she wanted him
without any encumbrances</i>

15:00.533 --> 15:03.368
and, Debbie was an encumbrance.

15:14.279 --> 15:16.392
[Candice]<i> Jealousy isn't always</i>

15:16.416 --> 15:19.350
<i>between love rivals.</i>

15:19.418 --> 15:22.598
It can be between
family members.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.534
<i>A lifetime of domination
and control</i>

15:25.558 --> 15:27.125

[Lynnanne] <i>Her death devastates</i>

All right. Come on in.

16:12.270 --> 16:15.451

Hey, pop.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.461

[Shannon]<i> Denise had her eye</i>
<i>on Maurice Coles</i>

16:35.895 --> 16:39.541
<i>for some time but knew
that he was married.</i>

16:39.565 --> 16:41.966
But as soon his wife passed

16:42.034 --> 16:45.169
Denise saw that as her chance

16:45.237 --> 16:48.172
to be the... be the shoulder

16:48.240 --> 16:51.487
for Maurice to lean on.

[Marqweisha]<i> She was</i>
<i>determined to move in.</i>

17:01.586 --> 17:03.254
I couldn't understand why.

Why you so eager
to be with someone

17:04.723 --> 17:06.591
<i>who just lost their spouse.</i>

17:06.658 --> 17:07.925
It was definitely too quick.

17:07.993 --> 17:09.727
I told my father
it was too quick.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.195
This is Latoya.

<i>that is not a good mix.</i>

[Candice]<i> Denise became an ally</i>

she wanted to help him

18:34.546 --> 18:36.280
Yeah, of course.

Don't be bringing
laundry here every weekend.

- Hey.

20:29.894 --> 20:32.274
[Shannon]<i> Martre</i>
<i>was very excited</i>

20:32.298 --> 20:36.278
about making this mask
as part of his application.

20:36.302 --> 20:39.014
[Lynnanne]<i> Martre sees this</i>
<i>as his ticket</i>

20:39.038 --> 20:40.871
<i>to a bright future.</i>

20:50.415 --> 20:53.818
[Lynnanne]<i> March 12th, 2017,</i>

20:53.885 --> 20:57.266
<i>19-year-old Martre Cole's dream</i>

20:57.290 --> 21:00.291
<i>of going to art school
has come true</i>

21:00.358 --> 21:03.405
<i>but before he can enroll,</i>

21:03.429 --> 21:05.529
<i>he disappears.</i>

21:08.300 --> 21:11.079
Simple, here it is.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.504
Looks just like him, doesn't it?

21:13.571 --> 21:16.040
[Marqweisha]<i> Denise was saying</i>
<i>how he was there earlier</i>

21:16.107 --> 21:19.554
and that him and her
had made a mask.

21:19.578 --> 21:24.626
Okay. So after he finished
with the mask, what did he do?

21:24.650 --> 21:26.851
He said,

21:26.918 --> 21:29.231
"I'm going to Michelle's
to get my wallet."

21:29.255 --> 21:31.233
[laughs]

21:31.257 --> 21:33.035
[Michelle]
<i>I didn't believe not one word</i>

21:33.059 --> 21:36.238
that came out of her mouth
at this time.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.707
[Lynnanne]
<i>The paper imprint of his face</i>

21:38.731 --> 21:42.867
<i>is the only trace of Martre
they find in the house.</i>

21:42.934 --> 21:47.738
[Michelle] The mask was like
a paper mache of Tre's face

21:47.806 --> 21:52.209
that didn't sit well
with me at all.

21:53.611 --> 21:55.924
<i>Yeah, I just didn't like...
I didn't like the mask.</i>

21:55.948 --> 21:57.615
- You try.
- Hey, hey.

21:57.682 --> 21:59.328
[Marqweisha] <i>She tried to like</i>

21:59.352 --> 22:01.686
<i>put it on me and Michelle,
and we backed up.</i>

22:01.753 --> 22:05.489
[Lynnanne]<i> Denise's behavior</i>
<i>makes the sisters suspicious.</i>

22:05.557 --> 22:07.669
[Marqweisha]
<i>She was extremely friendly</i>

22:07.693 --> 22:10.294
and I'm looking,
I was like, "That's weird.

22:10.362 --> 22:13.742
She don't ever talk
to Michelle."

22:13.766 --> 22:18.680
<i>I noticed Latoya
quickly grab her things.</i>

22:18.704 --> 22:21.505
She headed straight towards
the door and left.

22:21.573 --> 22:23.552
[Lynnanne]<i> And her chatty</i>
<i>younger sister</i>

22:23.576 --> 22:26.577
<i>is unusually quiet and solemn.</i>

22:26.644 --> 22:28.824
I think we should call
the police.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.359
Yeah.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.894
Don't be ridiculous.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.363
[Michelle]<i> I was like,</i>
<i>"Well, if he doesn't</i>

22:34.387 --> 22:35.653
come back tonight,

22:35.720 --> 22:40.435
I will be contacting
authorities."

22:40.459 --> 22:43.772
[Lynnanne]<i> The sisters file</i>
<i>a missing person's report.</i>

22:43.796 --> 22:47.832
<i>Three weeks later,
their worst fears come true.</i>

22:47.866 --> 22:49.911
<i>Martre's body is discovered</i>

22:49.935 --> 22:53.604
<i>dumped in a wooded area
just out of town.</i>

22:54.739 --> 22:58.120
[Shannon] <i>He was in a box</i>

22:58.144 --> 23:01.590
and he was put in there
in such a way

23:01.614 --> 23:03.125
almost like an accordion

23:03.149 --> 23:06.484
<i>with his hands behind his back.</i>

23:06.551 --> 23:08.753
I was mind blown.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.465
Um...

23:10.489 --> 23:13.090
I was disgusted,

23:13.158 --> 23:15.292
<i>angry, hurt.</i>

23:15.360 --> 23:19.563
I felt my heart, like,
literally break in half

23:19.631 --> 23:22.566
and I just don't understand.

23:24.836 --> 23:27.371
[Lynnanne]
<i>The body is strangely exposed</i>

23:27.439 --> 23:29.440
<i>and detectives think the killer</i>

23:29.507 --> 23:32.220
<i>may have only
half-finished the job.</i>

23:32.244 --> 23:35.290
<i>On a hunch,
they remove Martre's body</i>

23:35.314 --> 23:40.095
<i>but set up a camera
in case the killer returns.</i>

23:40.119 --> 23:44.522
<i>They also look into Martre's
art school application.</i>

23:44.589 --> 23:46.323
Sheila Crenshaw, please.

23:48.259 --> 23:49.527
No?

23:49.594 --> 23:51.128
What about in the past?

23:51.196 --> 23:54.465
[Lynnanne]<i> They discover</i>
<i>something very odd.</i>

23:55.800 --> 23:57.712
She doesn't exist.

23:57.736 --> 24:02.050
So who was sending
all those emails?

24:02.074 --> 24:06.143
[Shannon] We were able to find
the computer IP addresses

24:06.211 --> 24:10.325
to know that
it was really Denise Gay

24:10.349 --> 24:13.017
<i>who created this
fictitious person</i>

24:13.084 --> 24:15.886
<i>and created an email identity</i>

24:15.954 --> 24:18.355
as Sheila Crenshaw.

24:18.423 --> 24:20.057
[sighs] Denise?

24:22.761 --> 24:25.140
That's why she was helping him.

24:25.164 --> 24:29.166
[Candice]<i> The amount</i>
<i>of planning and execution</i>

24:29.234 --> 24:31.168
that Denise went through,

24:31.236 --> 24:34.749
it was so elaborate.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.953
[Lynnanne]<i> And the police's</i>
<i>hunch pays off.</i>

24:37.977 --> 24:40.622
<i>The hidden camera captures
the killer</i>

24:40.646 --> 24:43.358
<i>returning to the scene.</i>

24:43.382 --> 24:46.628
[Shannon] We were
hundred percent confident

24:46.652 --> 24:50.454
that the person in that image
was in fact Denise Gay.

24:53.258 --> 24:54.436
[Candice]
The police were watching

24:54.460 --> 24:57.261
the entire spectacle.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.307
[Lynnanne]
<i>The police have a body</i>

24:59.331 --> 25:03.378
<i>and evidence
of Denise's phony emails.</i>

25:03.402 --> 25:04.713
Looking good.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.715
[Lynnanne]
<i>Then an unlikely witness</i>

25:06.739 --> 25:10.407
<i>tells exactly how Martre died.</i>

25:10.475 --> 25:12.943
She described
how she was able to see

25:13.011 --> 25:15.857
<i>through the door of his room.</i>

25:15.881 --> 25:17.058
No, no, no, no, no.

25:17.082 --> 25:18.393
[Denise] Shh, it's okay.

25:18.417 --> 25:20.529
I'm not gonna put it
over your mouth.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.953
[Shannon]
That mask was described as

25:23.021 --> 25:27.024
not having any ability
to breathe through.

25:27.091 --> 25:28.893
How are you doing in there, Tre?

25:28.960 --> 25:30.027
Tre?

25:35.300 --> 25:37.279
[Martre] Get off me! Get off me!

25:37.303 --> 25:40.348
[Shannon] And she could see
her mother and her sister

25:40.372 --> 25:41.972
on top of Martre.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.618
[Martre] Get off me! Get off me!

25:43.642 --> 25:45.509
- Go.
- [Martre] Get off me!

25:45.577 --> 25:47.111
Go back to your room.

25:47.178 --> 25:50.180
[Shannon]<i> He was screaming</i>
<i>for his life.</i>

25:50.248 --> 25:55.030
She described how she saw
his feet kicking in the air,

25:55.054 --> 25:58.322
<i>how he was grasping for breath,</i>

25:58.389 --> 26:01.725
how he was begging for them
to get off of him.

26:01.793 --> 26:04.039
[Martre] Get off me! Get off me!

26:04.063 --> 26:06.130
[Shannon] When he said,
"Get off me, get off me,"

26:06.197 --> 26:08.732
it probably was the last breath

26:08.800 --> 26:10.067
he had in him.

26:12.804 --> 26:15.839
[dramatic music playing]

26:22.080 --> 26:24.059
[Shannon]
<i>And it is a few minutes later</i>

26:24.083 --> 26:27.618
<i>where she peeks out
and she sees this container.</i>

26:27.685 --> 26:29.864
Go to your room.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.155
Go.

26:31.222 --> 26:33.223
[Shannon] <i>And we know now</i>

26:33.291 --> 26:34.825
that Martre Coles' body

26:34.892 --> 26:38.940
was actually inside
that container.

26:38.964 --> 26:43.901
[Candice] Ultimately she was
the key to solving this case.

26:43.968 --> 26:46.548
[Lynnanne]<i> The 13-year-old</i>
<i>is the star witness</i>

26:46.572 --> 26:48.617
<i>for the prosecution.</i>

26:48.641 --> 26:52.009
<i>Denise and Latoya Gay
stand trial</i>

26:52.043 --> 26:54.178
<i>for conspiracy to commit murder</i>

26:54.245 --> 26:56.190
<i>and first-degree murder.</i>

26:56.214 --> 26:59.694
<i>They are found guilty
on both counts.</i>

26:59.718 --> 27:01.852
[Shannon]<i> The best</i>
<i>that we could theorize</i>

27:01.919 --> 27:03.965
<i>for the jury was that</i>

27:03.989 --> 27:08.303
he was simply in her way.

27:08.327 --> 27:12.173
<i>And a constant reminder
to Maurice</i>

27:12.197 --> 27:15.733
<i>of his beloved wife who died.</i>

27:18.069 --> 27:21.605
[Candice] She wanted to be
the only important person

27:21.673 --> 27:23.540
in Maurice's life.

27:23.608 --> 27:25.876
That meant Martre had to go.

27:25.943 --> 27:28.790
[Lynnanne]
<i>In 2018 Latoya receives</i>

27:28.814 --> 27:32.016
<i>a total of 30 years behind bars.</i>

27:32.083 --> 27:34.885
<i>Martre's sisters
have mixed feelings.</i>

27:34.952 --> 27:38.956
My heart really went out
to Latoya

27:39.023 --> 27:41.358
and her sister that
they were raised

27:41.426 --> 27:45.295
by a master manipulator.

27:45.363 --> 27:47.142
<i>I'm truly sorry
that both of them</i>

27:47.166 --> 27:51.969
were put in that predicament
by such a selfish woman.

<i>The mastermind, Denise Gay,</i>

<i>and in the state of Virginia,</i>

<i>life means life.</i>

28:01.512 --> 28:04.225
Denise is exactly

28:04.249 --> 28:07.117
the first day
I laid eyes on her,

28:07.185 --> 28:11.055
pure evil.

[Candice]<i> Fortunately Denise</i>
<i>is never gonna have</i>

28:13.124 --> 28:15.770
<i>the opportunity to commit
another murder</i>

28:15.794 --> 28:17.594
outside of prison.

28:17.662 --> 28:19.441
But if I were her cell mate,

28:19.465 --> 28:21.042
I wouldn't turn my back on her.

28:21.066 --> 28:24.068
[tense music playing]

28:33.244 --> 28:35.646

28:37.116 --> 28:39.183
<i>kind, loving, no problems.</i>

Mary told Billy

he would always have
a place with her.

29:19.490 --> 29:22.025
