00:47.113 --> 00:49.411
- No, Meatwad.
- Break, stupid.

00:49.482 --> 00:52.576
- Meatwad, the piñata's over there.
- Where is it?

00:52.952 --> 00:54.044
Here?

00:54.354 --> 00:57.187
You're the birthday boy.
Let's just take off the blindfold.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.521
- Is it back here?
- Meatwad.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.463
- Hooray! Meatwad, you hit it, see?
- Hurrah.

01:07.934 --> 01:09.834
- Where's the candy?
- Look, you got a cake.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.838
- Who needs candy? Come on, Meatwad.
- Is there candy in there?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.601
Just get your friends in here.

01:14.674 --> 01:18.440
Frylock, I'm friends with
a toilet paper tube, an apple, and a box.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.376
I'm crazy in the head.

01:20.847 --> 01:23.839
You gonna dis me, boy?
Dis me to my face.

01:23.917 --> 01:28.149
- Boxy, please, don't take it like that.
- How am I supposed to take it, then?

01:28.221 --> 01:31.315
We just want to celebrate my birthday
with some cake.

01:31.391 --> 01:34.224
I don't want no cake. I want me some pie.

01:34.694 --> 01:37.162
You understand what I'm saying?

01:38.398 --> 01:40.696
- No, sir.
- Let me break it down.

01:40.967 --> 01:45.199
You know, when you're in the shower
with some fine, foxy hoochie mama...

01:45.271 --> 01:47.034
and she got that...

01:48.174 --> 01:49.664
- What?
- Meatwad?

01:49.742 --> 01:51.676
I don't know if I believe that.

01:51.744 --> 01:54.736
I mean, I've seen action figures
without their pants.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.448
- They ain't got that.
- Meatwad.

01:57.517 --> 02:00.850
- He is talking here.
- I mean, I don't mean to interrupt.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.047
Watch out, he's got a knife.

02:04.157 --> 02:07.126
Okay, Boxy, put the knife down.

02:07.193 --> 02:09.092
<i>Let's all sing Happy Birthday. Ready?</i>

02:09.162 --> 02:12.791
<i>- Happy
- Happy birthday</i>

02:12.866 --> 02:15.562
Hold up. Stop. Don't sing.
Stop. Hold on a sec.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.433
Look who showed up.
I thought you didn't do birthdays.

02:18.505 --> 02:21.633
Do them?
I am responsible for the paradigm shift...

02:21.708 --> 02:26.202
in birthdays and how they will be viewed
in the following centuries.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.206
<i>- Shake, what the hell is that?
- You know The Birthday Song?</i>

02:30.283 --> 02:32.751
The famous one?
It usually puts everybody to sleep.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.845
You mean the one we were
trying to sing when you interrupted?

02:35.922 --> 02:38.823
Kiss that snooze fest goodbye,
because I wrote a new one.

02:38.892 --> 02:43.329
And from now on, whenever someone
blows out candles or unties a ribbon...

02:43.396 --> 02:46.490
this is what their waitresses
will be singing.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.793
- This is Zakk Wylde.
- This is Ozzy's old guy?

03:21.868 --> 03:24.428
The man knows his way
around five strings.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.064
You're telling me
that this is the new birthday song?

03:27.140 --> 03:30.735
Gee willikers!
It must be Obvious Day on Camp Stupid.

03:31.177 --> 03:35.238
<i>What it's called is
Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary.</i>

03:35.548 --> 03:37.778
It came to Geddy and I in a dream.

03:37.850 --> 03:41.308
- Geddy?
- Geddy Lee. Lead singer of Rush.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.385
Rush. Geddy Lee.

03:43.456 --> 03:46.323
Will you shut up
when the big people are talking?

03:46.559 --> 03:51.019
He happens to be extremely highly paid
for his input on this project.

03:51.097 --> 03:54.760
- Tell me this fades out right here.
- All right. Hang on. Okay.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.826
See, this is where you're supposed to say
the number of years.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.099
I'm gonna rewind it. You do it.
Okay. Here we go.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.162
Okay.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.604
Say it. How many years are you?

04:08.815 --> 04:11.249
Just say how old you are, Meatwad.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.110
- I don't know.
- All right.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.055
You're just ruining the song.
What are you, 55, 56?

04:18.124 --> 04:19.317
Yes, I'm 55.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.485
<i>Fifty-five bells</i>

04:24.430 --> 04:26.796
You got to be kidding.
No one's gonna sing this.

04:26.866 --> 04:29.835
They better. Otherwise,
how am I gonna pay Zakk Wylde...

04:29.902 --> 04:32.598
for his priceless participation
in my project?

04:32.672 --> 04:35.334
- See, I got to get royalties on this.
- It's done, right?

04:35.408 --> 04:37.740
Hang on.
We're gonna repeat this verse again.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.301
Then there's another verse
about the death cycle...

04:40.380 --> 04:43.747
which Zakk and I both feel
is really important to the piece.

04:44.684 --> 04:48.017
- That's it. This sucks.
- You can't have birth without death.

04:48.087 --> 04:50.555
It's the duplicitous edge
which we all walk upon.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.614
Can I blow out the candles now?

04:52.692 --> 04:56.128
- Because there's wax all over my cake.
- Of course. It's your birthday.

04:56.195 --> 04:59.130
- But cough up the royalties first.
- How much did that cost?

04:59.198 --> 05:01.325
I'm so tired of people in the private sector.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.393
Look, every business has
an initial investment, okay?

05:04.470 --> 05:06.870
Everybody has birthdays,
and they all need to sing.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.430
How much did it cost?

05:09.509 --> 05:11.739
I guess we'll start with travel.

05:11.811 --> 05:15.679
Zakk, as you well know,
traveled by a train of white stallions...

05:15.748 --> 05:18.979
which I had to buy and feed.
And, of course, you know...

05:19.052 --> 05:21.145
- the snow machine...
- Give me that.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.654
$1.4 million.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.714
The money is gonna roll right in.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.727
You know how many birthdays
there are a year?

05:28.795 --> 05:30.262
There are hundreds.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.927
Literally hundreds.

05:37.136 --> 05:40.196
You see this? How much can a horse eat?
They're white.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.935
They got to be bleached?
What the hell is this crap?

05:43.009 --> 05:45.705
Shake? I've got Zakk's people
on the phone here.

05:45.778 --> 05:49.009
- They still haven't gotten a check.
- I haven't gotten their invoice.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.710
- Tell them to re-fax it.
- You tell them.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.377
How are we gonna do that?

05:55.555 --> 05:59.457
Wait. If that's the guy about the house,
tell him I'll be right there.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.890
- House?
- Yeah.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.258
For sale? You put the house up for sale?

06:03.329 --> 06:05.388
Yeah, just till we get
some cash flow going.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.729
Shake, we rent the house.
We don't own it.

06:07.800 --> 06:11.327
I know that. I have no intention of leaving.
But we need money.

06:11.571 --> 06:12.868
How are you doing?

06:12.939 --> 06:16.136
So you saw the sign. I guess
you want to take a look at the house.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.144
I mean, we have a couple other people
coming later today.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.339
It's really a lucky thing you stopped by.

06:21.414 --> 06:24.850
Trees. I take care of them.
I'm a tree wizard.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.544
That is great.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.654
Come on in. I've got a tray of muffins.
One. Take one.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.486
Tree wizard needs $6.48.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.049
And, as you can see, it's fully furnished.

06:35.361 --> 06:38.262
Two-zero.
No bathroom, and that is by design.

06:38.331 --> 06:42.290
We don't want people to mess things up
with their waste, know what I'm saying?

06:42.802 --> 06:45.293
Right. Of course you do.
You know what I'm saying.

06:45.371 --> 06:49.398
And, as you can see,
the phone is highly cordless.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.303
- Alabama.
- Yes. Absolutely.

06:53.379 --> 06:57.247
We are conveniently located
adjacent to Alabama. What else?

06:57.984 --> 07:01.044
In the back, there's a ton
of science equipment. It must be worth...

07:01.120 --> 07:03.748
- That stuff's not for sale.
- Bring your muffin. It's here.

07:03.823 --> 07:05.120
Shake, he's gone.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.386
- And so is the TV.
- And the muffins, too.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.860
I'm sorry.
Did I not bury you in the backyard?

07:09.929 --> 07:11.362
Stay away from the muffins.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.524
Look at this.
We got another potential buyer.

07:13.599 --> 07:14.998
Hello! It's snowing.

07:15.067 --> 07:18.161
- They're gonna cancel school.
- Oh, no. What kind of car is it?

07:18.237 --> 07:21.400
Don't tell me it's a chariot driven
by a train of white stallions.

07:21.474 --> 07:23.965
It's a chariot driven by a train
of white stallions.

07:24.043 --> 07:27.240
It's Zakk. You got to cover for me.
I wasn't here.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.641
- Is Milkshake here?
- No. I mean...

07:30.716 --> 07:33.947
The beating I'm about to put on him
is gonna be indescribable.

07:34.020 --> 07:38.354
- He's in the back. Go ahead and get him.
- Thanks. Nice place, by the way.

07:38.424 --> 07:39.948
I see you.

07:40.526 --> 07:43.654
Zakk, my man, I've been looking...
Thank God you stopped by.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.629
No. Put that down.

07:46.532 --> 07:49.501
- So where's my money?
- Is this really about money?

07:49.569 --> 07:51.298
I thought it was about the love.

07:51.370 --> 07:54.737
- I thought it was about the music.
- No. It's about the money.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.368
The jack is gonna start rolling in.
You know that live event I alluded to?

07:58.444 --> 07:59.604
It's happening.

07:59.679 --> 08:03.911
And I want you to check out this venue,
because we got an exclusive booking.

08:04.183 --> 08:07.084
See? Kids love pizza.
And they love squalor.

08:07.253 --> 08:10.780
Meatwad's already experiencing
our interactive fun zone.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.348
Which wire you can eat
and which one you can't?

08:13.426 --> 08:16.418
- Meatwad, put that down.
- I know, Dad. Don't eat the hot meat.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.657
- But the ground's pretty tasty, isn't it?
- No.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.426
Frylock, will you please calm down?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.469
I know we have to have rubber mats
put in, because the kids...

08:23.536 --> 08:26.164
- The kids need to be grounded.
- This asbestos is itchy.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.799
You're gonna blast that dumb-ass song
here, aren't you?

08:28.875 --> 08:30.900
Not me. Kids are coming to see...

08:30.977 --> 08:35.607
the Black Mountain Scorpion Hoedown
Bluegrass Experience Gang...

08:35.681 --> 08:38.376
featuring Zakk Wylde on washtub bass.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.315
Zakk, did we not do the sound check?

08:42.388 --> 08:45.824
No, jackass. I'm not working
with any plastic scorpions.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.553
These things are beyond gay.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.993
Zakk, the song needs exposure...

08:50.062 --> 08:52.155
and the only way to do that is to tour.

08:52.231 --> 08:55.428
Dumb ass, take a look.
These things are bolted into the ground.

08:55.501 --> 08:59.028
Yeah. We're talking
about wicked poisonous scorpions.

08:59.105 --> 09:02.199
- There's gonna be children here. Come on.
- Okay. Where's Geddy?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.435
Geddy?

09:04.310 --> 09:06.107
- Geddy who?
- Geddy Lee?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.847
I don't know.
I don't know who you're talking about.

09:08.915 --> 09:10.746
Of Rush. "Of salesman"?

09:10.816 --> 09:12.306
<i>Of salesman</i>

09:12.385 --> 09:14.353
You swore to God that he would be here.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.646
Yeah.

09:16.455 --> 09:20.016
Geddy's people said that
he was heavily involved in his solo album.

09:20.092 --> 09:22.026
He wouldn't do it, would he?

09:22.261 --> 09:25.094
- Of course he would do it...
- If you had the money.

09:25.164 --> 09:29.692
Mostly I was dealing with the maid
who answers the phone at his house.

09:29.769 --> 09:32.670
But I have told Consuela several times...

09:33.172 --> 09:36.107
He's getting a Post-it on the fridge.
I do know that.

09:36.175 --> 09:38.575
Why did I even get wasted
and work with you?

09:38.644 --> 09:42.603
I mean, this isn't even a real microphone.
It's a stick with a marshmallow on it.

09:42.682 --> 09:45.549
- The room is intimate. Just project.
- Project what?

09:45.618 --> 09:47.916
I don't even know
what the... you're talking about.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.420
You got to go from the diaphragm.

09:49.488 --> 09:51.649
I mean,
I was... wasted when we recorded it.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.521
Just follow Deadly's lead on this.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.187
He knows this song
like the back of his stinger.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.561
And watch out for the stinger.
It will kill you.

10:00.700 --> 10:04.329
- Come on, Meatwad. Come out and dance.
- Those are big roaches.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.132
No. They're scorpions.

10:06.205 --> 10:09.003
- You want to meet them?
- Scorpions? No.

10:09.075 --> 10:11.908
Zakk "Mild," let's kick it up a notch.

10:12.078 --> 10:14.444
What do you need, a drink?
You want some pills?

10:14.513 --> 10:17.539
- Need me to get some bitches?
- No. I ain't doing this.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.915
I know what you mean.
I'm not really feeling it...

10:19.986 --> 10:21.977
because I can't feel like humans,
you know?

10:22.054 --> 10:23.487
If only there was some way.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.525
I don't know if it's that.
I just think the song sucks.

10:26.592 --> 10:28.082
Is it that it sucks...

10:28.160 --> 10:30.560
or you just want to go do, like, solo thing?

10:30.630 --> 10:34.293
- Is that what you want to do now?
- Yeah, maybe if I do that, I will.

10:35.167 --> 10:38.568
Man, don't you pull it out on us.
You're gonna use this...

10:40.973 --> 10:43.533
Can I say that when I ordered them,
I had no idea...

10:43.609 --> 10:45.440
they came armed with laser cannons?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.273
She probably charged me extra, too.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.611
What will you tell Zakk's wife
and children?

10:50.683 --> 10:53.117
You saw him. The guy was drunk
and out of control...

10:53.185 --> 10:54.675
What's that jet doing in our yard?

10:54.754 --> 10:56.449
Hell. What does it look like?

10:56.522 --> 10:59.923
It's in the shape of a bass guitar,
and it's painted with a giant owI.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.517
Swooping down from the moon.
I know. It's Geddy's jet.

11:02.595 --> 11:05.393
- Floor it. We got to get out of here.
- Hi, Geddy.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.533
Shut up. Just keep driving.
Don't look at him. Go.

11:09.602 --> 11:12.002
<i>- Where are we going?
- Mexico. Ándale.</i>
