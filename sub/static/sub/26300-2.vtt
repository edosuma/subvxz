WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:03.000
- Get down!
<i>- Previously on</i> Star...

00:03.030 --> 00:05.550
Give me my money, or
next time we won't miss.

00:05.630 --> 00:06.976
Prepare for emergency landing.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.280
We're gonna be okay.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.320
- Mr. Ferrera.
- Record business is over.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.846
The hell I'm letting you close us down.

00:11.870 --> 00:13.730
- What's this about?
- I need a partner.

00:13.770 --> 00:15.400
- I miss you.
- Looks like you miss

00:15.460 --> 00:16.920
<i>Atlanta a little bit more, though.</i>

00:16.940 --> 00:19.770
- I said get...
- I said take your clothes off.

00:19.810 --> 00:22.320
Gravity Records, huh? Nice move.

00:22.380 --> 00:23.779
You better bring real
cash to the playground

00:23.780 --> 00:24.780
before I close the park.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.860
I still believe in Take 3.
Well, it don't matter anyway.

00:27.880 --> 00:30.220
Y'all still under contract.
Y'all owe me another album.

00:30.250 --> 00:31.450
I'm pregnant.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.690
I got this.

00:36.790 --> 00:39.790
As long as I got you, Jahil.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.500
Hey, Lottie.

00:47.540 --> 00:49.670
Get up.

00:54.580 --> 00:57.260
Carlotta. Carlotta.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.880
Andy?

00:59.380 --> 01:01.900
- What you doing here?
- Jahil gave me the keys

01:01.920 --> 01:03.650
to get in when me and
Angel were recording.

01:03.690 --> 01:06.350
- Are you sleeping here?
- Don't worry about what I'm doing.

01:06.390 --> 01:08.099
I set you up in Philly for a reason.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.160
Tired of being a bitch.

01:09.190 --> 01:10.560
I don't want to run no more.

01:10.590 --> 01:12.006
I want my life back,
and I want my career.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.610
Well, you ain't gonna have
none of that if my sister

01:13.630 --> 01:15.310
- get a whiff of you.
- Think I can get the money.

01:15.330 --> 01:17.576
- I know a couple people...
- Cassie live by a street code.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.270
It ain't even about the money no more.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.580
It's about pride.

01:20.620 --> 01:22.850
It was you she wanted dead, not Jahil.

01:24.420 --> 01:26.620
- Can you talk to her for me?
- I can't.

01:26.660 --> 01:28.800
You're the only loose
end to the shooting.

01:28.840 --> 01:31.130
- What about you?
- I'm family.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.060
We don't snitch.

01:34.100 --> 01:35.990
I can't even tell Cotton what she did.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.170
So what am I supposed to do?

01:37.200 --> 01:40.550
Well, I suggest you stay
here till I figure out

01:40.580 --> 01:43.100
how to keep your stupid
ass alive, all right?

01:43.120 --> 01:44.740
Okay.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.390 --> 01:55.720
Ah. Sorry I'm late.

01:55.750 --> 01:57.650
I spent the night at
the office last night.

01:57.690 --> 01:59.360
Had to stop and change my clothes.

01:59.390 --> 02:00.760
You bring Simone?

02:00.780 --> 02:03.460
She's not coming, Star.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.500
I tried.

02:05.530 --> 02:07.130
I know.

02:09.900 --> 02:12.740
There we are.

02:14.270 --> 02:16.470
That's your baby.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.879
Girl, you are pregnant.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.340
How am I gonna raise a kid?

02:25.480 --> 02:28.320
I just think about my mama, you know?

02:28.350 --> 02:30.840
- I'll give you two some time.
- Thank you.

02:31.090 --> 02:34.830
Look... you are not your mother, Star.

02:35.930 --> 02:38.240
You ain't got to make the same mistakes.

02:38.330 --> 02:40.400
And you don't have to do this alone.

02:40.430 --> 02:41.900
You got the village.

02:41.930 --> 02:43.400
Simone won't even talk to me.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.040
She'll come around.

02:45.070 --> 02:49.020
And you still got me,
and you got Cotton.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.419
And I guess Bruce could learn
how to change a diaper, too.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.426
- Oh, I can't wait to see that.
- Oh, yeah, it's gonna be

02:53.450 --> 02:54.890
- way too much powder.
- I'm going to milk it.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.380
And you have the father if you want.

02:59.420 --> 03:02.340
He's not in the picture.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.930
Hold up. I got to take this.
Give me a sec.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.560
Picking up coffee,

03:11.600 --> 03:13.700
- or just on Carlotta time?
- Excuse me?

03:13.730 --> 03:15.070
I need you in the office ASAP.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.600
Well, I'm kind of in the
middle of something,

03:16.620 --> 03:18.256
- and I have a 10:00.
- I'm trying to land

03:18.280 --> 03:20.436
a hot movie project that'll
put Gravity Media on the map.

03:20.460 --> 03:22.140
So what does that have to do with me?

03:22.170 --> 03:25.280
I need Take 3 to deliver a hot
song to tease the soundtrack.

03:25.310 --> 03:28.710
My artists need to be focused
on their own album projects.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.540
They need to be focused
on crossover appeal.

03:30.580 --> 03:31.780
You said it yourself.

03:31.820 --> 03:35.220
This is Gravity Records,
not Midtown Sound.

03:37.420 --> 03:39.070
We're leaving for the
office in ten minutes,

03:39.090 --> 03:42.090
and I have a call in
to the film producers.

03:42.130 --> 03:45.330
Papi Chulo.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.800
What's this?

03:47.830 --> 03:50.140
No sleepovers. You know the rules.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.800
Won't happen again, hmm?

03:51.840 --> 03:53.370
I'll get your car pulled around.

03:53.410 --> 03:56.010
Oh, no, I already did
that, and I'm driving.

04:00.510 --> 04:02.010
Wake up, Mama.

04:02.050 --> 04:04.150
I need to get to work.

04:05.890 --> 04:08.520
"Music division head Carlotta Brown

04:08.550 --> 04:09.950
"carries her weight

04:09.990 --> 04:12.320
in a mega-merger with Gravity Media."

04:13.600 --> 04:14.790
Give me a second.

04:14.830 --> 04:17.990
Like my sister really
needs a bigger head.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.079
Gravity Records is still just a label.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.700
We got a business model that
everybody's doing right now,

04:22.720 --> 04:24.320
from Chance the Rapper to Frank Ocean.

04:24.340 --> 04:25.616
I already got a streaming service

04:25.640 --> 04:26.800
ready to partner with us.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.540
All we need is a hot artist.

04:28.570 --> 04:30.160
Hot artists ain't enough.

04:30.310 --> 04:31.800
I want one of Lottie's.

04:31.910 --> 04:33.480
I got an in with Star.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.280
I'm not about to build my whole business

04:35.300 --> 04:37.410
on no damn white girl. Are you crazy?

04:37.450 --> 04:41.350
I need me a strong black
Mandingo, like Noah Brooks.

04:41.390 --> 04:42.876
Ain't he the biggest
artist on her label?

04:42.900 --> 04:45.300
Yeah, Noah's still trying to
get his head back on straight.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.420
- And?
- And, besides, he's not responding

04:47.440 --> 04:49.180
to nobody coming at him all gangsta.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.130
Gangsta?

04:51.160 --> 04:52.930
If we gonna be in business together,

04:52.940 --> 04:54.300
you got to promise me you legit.

04:55.020 --> 04:58.500
I'm as clean as you are
pretty, pretty boy.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.210
Now go get me Noah Brooks.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.010
Look, I don't know who you
think you talking to,

05:04.040 --> 05:06.660
but I'll see what I can do.

05:35.470 --> 05:36.840
It's gonna be okay.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.280
We're gonna be okay.

05:39.460 --> 05:41.410
<i>Alex. Alex.</i>

05:42.280 --> 05:43.380
- Hey.
- So I was able

05:43.420 --> 05:46.420
to cancel the moving truck.

05:46.450 --> 05:48.880
But... we still got to pay the deposit.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.750
I should make Carlotta pay

05:50.790 --> 05:52.620
since she's forcing me to do this album.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.730
I should be in New York right now.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.660
You know you can model
just about anywhere.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.880
Can you? Uh, no, 'cause
we're in Atlanta...

06:00.920 --> 06:03.100
... and there aren't any
real modeling gigs here.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.040
I think you need to slow down.

06:05.070 --> 06:08.520
You're taking on every single gig
ever since that plane crash.

06:08.620 --> 06:12.740
Um... I got to get to the studio.

06:12.780 --> 06:14.650
The sooner I get this album done,

06:14.680 --> 06:16.950
the sooner we can get to New York.

06:19.490 --> 06:21.620
Grandma, I don't know if you heard,

06:21.640 --> 06:24.490
but me and Alex are not
going to New York anymore.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.360
I was gonna tell you last night,
but I know you were asleep.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.780
What, you ain't got nothing
smart to say about that?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.900
Grandma, what happened to your face?

06:37.940 --> 06:40.340
Grandma, what happened?

06:42.980 --> 06:44.256
Yeah, so
they say it's going to take

06:44.280 --> 06:46.680
about six months to finish this album.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.439
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault, babe.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.840
I know you want to be here with me.

06:52.660 --> 06:54.180
Look, I got to go, okay?

06:54.260 --> 06:55.420
But I love you.

06:55.450 --> 06:56.660
Love you, too.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.560
No other company
can secure talent,

06:58.590 --> 07:00.260
marketing, and music for the film.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.300
Gravity Media is full service.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.830
Yeah, we'll talk later.

07:03.860 --> 07:06.530
- Simone.
- Hey.

07:06.570 --> 07:09.300
Um... about the other night,

07:09.340 --> 07:11.470
I just... wanted to say I'm sorry

07:11.480 --> 07:13.340
that I slipped away
without saying anything.

07:13.370 --> 07:15.370
You know, I had a lot to drink, so...

07:15.410 --> 07:17.040
whatever happened between us...

07:17.080 --> 07:19.570
Nothing happened. We
talked, you threw up

07:19.580 --> 07:21.426
all over your clothes, I
put them in the laundry.

07:21.450 --> 07:25.140
Yeah, okay. I was gone.

07:25.220 --> 07:27.050
- Hey, why are you out here?
- Well,

07:27.090 --> 07:28.600
we were all supposed
to meet at the studio,

07:28.620 --> 07:29.920
but Star has an appointment

07:29.940 --> 07:31.770
and Alex is doing some
live thing on the Gram,

07:31.790 --> 07:34.120
so I'm just waiting around as usual.

07:34.260 --> 07:36.440
Hey, put yourself first.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.060
Put some rules in place.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.100
Thank you.

07:40.130 --> 07:43.270
And I would never leave you waiting.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.520
What the hell are you
doing in my office?

07:51.620 --> 07:54.660
- I already told you.
- Look, you may be my boss,

07:54.740 --> 07:56.499
but I'm not your bitch, Mateo.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.626
We were actually just finishing
up the mock-up for the movie

07:58.650 --> 08:01.180
to take two of our artists'
careers to the next level.

08:01.220 --> 08:03.790
All right, we want
to show synergy across

08:03.820 --> 08:05.820
our digital space.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.190
Gravity Film, Gravity Records.
Take a look.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.900
You want to put Star and
Noah in a movie together?

08:11.930 --> 08:13.660
- That's right.
- Then you need to go through me

08:13.680 --> 08:15.700
before you start making
plans for my artists.

08:15.800 --> 08:19.140
<i>Our</i> artists. <i>Black Ivy</i> is raw and edgy.

08:19.180 --> 08:20.870
Noah Brooks is the king of R&B,

08:20.910 --> 08:24.470
and I think his audience
love his bad boy image.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.240
And Star... she's got tons of followers.

08:26.280 --> 08:28.210
I mean, she's wrong
in all the best ways.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.480
So we want to land the script

08:30.520 --> 08:32.820
and start filming by the end
of the quarter so we can get

08:32.850 --> 08:33.880
the investors excited.

08:33.890 --> 08:35.690
The answer is no.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.220
Star can't do it.

08:37.289 --> 08:39.020
No?

08:39.059 --> 08:40.700
You're the president of Gravity Records,

08:40.720 --> 08:43.320
and you're willing to leave
easy money on the table?

08:46.370 --> 08:48.670
I need to tell you something...

08:48.700 --> 08:51.640
in the strictest confidence.

08:51.670 --> 08:54.970
Sorry, y'all. Had to get
some blood work done.

08:55.010 --> 08:58.540
So Gravity Media is
going after a hot movie script.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.110
And they want y'all to write a
song for the soundtrack ASAP.

09:01.150 --> 09:03.980
You need to tell him that
this isn't a drive-through.

09:04.020 --> 09:05.579
You can't just order up a track.

09:05.580 --> 09:08.400
You saw what Kendrick did
for TDE with <i> Black Panther.</i>

09:08.500 --> 09:10.820
This could be a good
opportunity for Take 3.

09:11.990 --> 09:13.790
Or you individually.

09:13.830 --> 09:17.130
He wants to announce it this
afternoon at the press junket.

09:17.160 --> 09:21.570
So, I need you to read the
script and start writing.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.330
Now that we're all
working together again,

09:23.370 --> 09:25.540
can we promise to respect
each other's time?

09:25.570 --> 09:27.470
I had a doctor's appointment.

09:28.140 --> 09:30.010
Look.

09:33.310 --> 09:35.300
Still got nothing to say, Simone?

09:35.330 --> 09:37.050
What do you want me to say, Star?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.820
- Nothing.
- I just don't think

09:39.850 --> 09:41.450
you're ready to have nobody's baby.

09:41.490 --> 09:44.060
I mean, you get high off of
the idea of being famous.

09:44.190 --> 09:45.560
That's all you got?

09:45.620 --> 09:47.320
I mean, that baby's
just gonna be messed up

09:47.360 --> 09:49.590
- just like Mama messed us up.
- Simone...

09:49.660 --> 09:52.260
... stop.

09:53.670 --> 09:55.800
Star, what's wrong?

09:56.640 --> 09:58.000
Who outed me?

09:58.040 --> 09:59.879
- _
- SIMONE: Anybody who took a good

09:59.880 --> 10:01.400
look at your ass.

10:01.510 --> 10:05.160
Why would this be on Gravity
Media's gossip site?

10:07.580 --> 10:11.350
I'm-a kill that Ricky
Ricardo-looking ass.

10:11.380 --> 10:14.159
- I'm-a kill you.
- Star.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.180
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm-a sue you.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.890
- Star, slow down.
- No, he's messing with my life.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.260
Have you seen the tweets?

10:20.290 --> 10:21.806
They're already talking trash about me.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.540
Listen, we're trying to
launch a digital platform,

10:24.580 --> 10:26.760
and gossip attracts traffic.

10:26.780 --> 10:28.000
- Gossip?
- Star, look,

10:28.030 --> 10:30.430
if you want to hit somebody, hit me.

10:30.470 --> 10:32.099
- I told him.
- You?

10:32.100 --> 10:33.669
He wanted to put you in
his movie, and I had

10:33.670 --> 10:36.070
to explain to him why you
weren't available right now,

10:36.110 --> 10:38.810
- but he gave me his word.
- And you gave me yours.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.500
I get that you're not
our manager anymore,

10:41.510 --> 10:42.980
but now you're just a suit?

10:43.020 --> 10:44.510
You got to see these numbers.

10:44.550 --> 10:47.010
The site is getting hits
all over the place,

10:47.020 --> 10:48.526
and everybody's talking about you, Star.

10:48.550 --> 10:50.616
And I'm sure there are going
to be more questions for you

10:50.640 --> 10:52.096
at the press conference this afternoon.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.219
You think I'm showing up to
help you launch a company?

10:54.220 --> 10:55.320
Hell no.

10:55.430 --> 10:57.730
Don't be foolish. Come on.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.280
Use the attention to work for you.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.120
That's what a real star does.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.660
Take it out of my budget.

11:28.890 --> 11:30.190
What's up, man?

11:31.190 --> 11:32.930
Not much.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.900
- Long time.
- Too long.

11:34.940 --> 11:37.100
I figured I'd stop by and see you.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.000
I was hoping we could sit
down and talk business.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.540
Is that right?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.120
Yeah.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.040
My partner and I got a new venture.

11:45.070 --> 11:48.080
Indie, streaming, artist-driven.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.780
None of this corporate BS.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.199
And I know your contract's
coming up for renegotiation.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.980
Yeah, it is.

11:54.020 --> 11:56.580
But I ain't looking to do
business with your shady ass.

11:56.620 --> 11:58.140
Where you been at

11:58.160 --> 12:00.020
the last three months
when I was in rehab?

12:00.110 --> 12:02.570
I ain't get no call from you, nothing.

12:02.610 --> 12:05.240
But now we got business. Now we boys.

12:05.330 --> 12:08.400
I made a mistake. I can admit that.

12:08.430 --> 12:10.500
- I could also fix it.
- I'm done

12:10.520 --> 12:12.800
giving grown-ass men second chances.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.970
We ain't got no business, bro.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.100
We done.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.810
Mr. Jones?

12:26.850 --> 12:28.950
Can I have a moment?

12:29.920 --> 12:31.460
We found your grandmother's clothing.

12:31.490 --> 12:34.500
It indicates potential
signs of a sexual assault.

12:34.540 --> 12:36.180
It's vital we get her
down to the hospital

12:36.200 --> 12:38.060
to administer a rape kit.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.900
A rape kit?

12:41.300 --> 12:43.300
Yes.

12:50.610 --> 12:52.500
Grandma, I...

12:55.780 --> 12:57.710
I was talking to the cop.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.810
We may have to go down to the
hospital for an examination.

13:00.850 --> 13:03.850
They say you need to do a rape kit.

13:03.890 --> 13:07.550

You know, you should just...

15:11.810 --> 15:13.560
really learn how to let it all go.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.660
Oh, that would be really
easy if I were you.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.250
Your IG comments are full

15:17.280 --> 15:18.766
of people telling you how great you are.

15:18.790 --> 15:20.850
You're a plane crash

15:20.860 --> 15:21.980
I'm a pregnant whore.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.370
Yeah, well, then don't respond.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.740
Why, 'cause you agree with them?

15:24.760 --> 15:26.580
I mean, I can have my
own opinion, right?

15:26.640 --> 15:29.060
Yeah, you always have
an opinion, Simone.

15:29.100 --> 15:31.080
For once could it be on my side?

15:31.100 --> 15:32.540
I have always been on your side.

15:32.570 --> 15:33.780
I've been committed to this group,

15:33.800 --> 15:35.350
and we're supposed to
be a team, but instead

15:35.370 --> 15:37.160
you make it all about your damn self.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.560
I think about myself?

15:38.710 --> 15:40.140
You've done everything you can

15:40.160 --> 15:41.810
to get away from me and this group.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.610
Which is exactly why you
ran off with Angel.

15:43.650 --> 15:45.280
Please leave Angel out of this.

15:45.310 --> 15:47.180
You're the one leaving
Angel out. Not me.

15:47.220 --> 15:50.060
You were clinging to him 'cause
that's exactly what you do.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.930
But when you got sick of
me, you followed his ass

15:51.950 --> 15:53.420
- all the way to the D.R.
- No.

15:53.460 --> 15:54.650
I made sacrifices for us.

15:54.690 --> 15:56.190
There's a difference there, Star.

15:56.230 --> 15:57.850
- Sure you did.
- Who knew that pregnancy

15:57.880 --> 15:59.360
would make you even more of a bitch?

15:59.380 --> 16:01.440
Hey! Not today,
you little she-devils.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.646
- Yes, we are doing it today!
- I am so sick of her ass...

16:03.670 --> 16:05.400
What you're gonna do today

16:05.420 --> 16:06.999
is get that song finished

16:07.000 --> 16:08.476
without tearing each other's heads up,

16:08.500 --> 16:10.100
and that's per Carlotta's orders.

16:10.140 --> 16:11.670
Wait, Derek. I really, really need you

16:11.710 --> 16:12.860

16:13.010 --> 16:15.280
Y'all make a bitch need a zanny.

16:15.310 --> 16:17.340
No.

16:24.590 --> 16:26.590
Where you going?

16:27.730 --> 16:29.170
I need a break, too.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.930
This is not your fault.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.440

16:46.480 --> 16:48.700

17:19.099 --> 17:20.810
What's your opinion?

17:21.970 --> 17:23.910
I'm not here to judge.

17:23.940 --> 17:26.609
People can be brutal.

17:26.650 --> 17:29.310
I know that.

17:29.350 --> 17:31.280
You just got to ignore it.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.450
You know me.

17:33.490 --> 17:35.620
I keep it pushing.

17:36.690 --> 17:38.900
Look...

17:38.980 --> 17:41.160
I know I was using a lot on tour,

17:41.190 --> 17:43.830
and you were missing the girls,

17:43.860 --> 17:45.760
and we were pretty messed up

17:45.800 --> 17:47.440
and probably partied too much.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.730
You don't have to do this.

17:49.770 --> 17:51.540
Look, I-I'm not trying
to be like my pops

17:51.570 --> 17:53.740
and leave my kid out in the cold.

17:55.610 --> 17:59.040
If the child is mine, I
have a right to know.

18:00.150 --> 18:02.280
I did the math.

18:03.320 --> 18:06.600

are not the father.

18:08.180 --> 18:10.620

20:14.980 --> 20:17.410
feature film,<i> Black Ivy,</i>
starring Noah Brooks

20:17.450 --> 20:19.180
with a soundtrack from Take 3.

20:19.220 --> 20:21.300
A new single will be released

20:21.320 --> 20:23.050
tomorrow night on Gravity
Media's website.

20:23.090 --> 20:25.300
Now I'll entertain your questions.

20:27.490 --> 20:28.760
All right, Star.

20:28.790 --> 20:30.390
Looks like all the
questions are for you.

20:36.370 --> 20:37.870
All right.

20:37.900 --> 20:41.640
Well, I'm happy to announce
that I am pregnant.

20:41.670 --> 20:43.260
And I don't intend on that slowing down

20:43.270 --> 20:44.640
my career in the slightest.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.900
If you want to keep up with my music,

20:45.920 --> 20:48.680
follow my IG and my website for updates.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.910
@Charlene321 wants to know

20:50.950 --> 20:53.340
how come you haven't
revealed who the father is?

20:53.420 --> 20:55.620
And what type of role
model do you claim to be?

20:55.650 --> 20:57.860
- That is personal.
- Yeah.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.320
Can we get back to the film?

20:59.360 --> 21:00.770
When Ms. Davis answers the question.

21:00.790 --> 21:02.960
She ain't got to answer
nothing. Next question.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.640
Okay, then, Noah,
we all know the history here.

21:05.660 --> 21:06.660
Are you the father?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.120
- Shut it down.
- All right,

21:08.140 --> 21:10.919
NosyBitch321 and all you
other nosy bitches...

21:10.920 --> 21:12.816
- Star, please.
- No, no, no. You want to know something?

21:12.840 --> 21:14.120
I'll tell you what you can know.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.020
It's none of your damn
business who got me pregnant

21:16.040 --> 21:17.310
or how they got me pregnant.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.510
As far as what kind of role model I am,

21:19.550 --> 21:20.999
go in the kitchen and ask your mama

21:21.000 --> 21:22.009
who your real daddy is.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.850
All y'all, too.

21:30.190 --> 21:31.990
Welcome to Gravity Media.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.060
I still don't like your ass.

21:41.350 --> 21:43.350
That's them hormones kicking in.

21:43.380 --> 21:44.840
Get the hell out my way!

21:44.900 --> 21:47.890
- Star!
- Don't see me right here?

21:47.920 --> 21:49.520
Star? Star, slow down.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.890
It's probably not good for your baby.

21:51.930 --> 21:54.790
Now you care about my baby?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.980
Now you want to look out?

21:57.010 --> 21:58.819
Girl, I heard you threw
up on our new boss.

21:58.820 --> 22:00.256
I'm trying to look out for all of us.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.360
So that's what you care about.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.850
Yes, you're like a bulldozer
running everybody over.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.670
- Are you okay?
- I've always been that way, Simone.

22:05.690 --> 22:06.970
That's how we got out of foster care.

22:06.980 --> 22:09.990
That's how we survived
when Mama was high.

22:10.030 --> 22:12.180
I bulldoze so you don't have to.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.640
But I'm selfish, right?

22:26.500 --> 22:29.040
- There he is.
- What's up, Andy?

22:29.080 --> 22:30.380
Man, it's good to see you.

22:30.410 --> 22:32.060
I really appreciate you
meeting me out here, bro.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.920
Yeah, man, it's all good.
Where you been, man?

22:33.950 --> 22:36.800
Around, up,
down, everywhere, man.

22:36.820 --> 22:39.890
That... That Jahil thing
really, really messed me up.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.680
- So...
- Yeah, it was heavy.

22:43.390 --> 22:48.140
Look, bro, I know we ain't
never been... cool or nothing.

22:48.220 --> 22:50.280
And that's my fault.

22:50.320 --> 22:53.180
I'm in some trouble.

22:53.220 --> 22:55.820
I owe some people some money, and...

22:56.060 --> 22:57.980
I can't really go to my family about it,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.120
so, you know...

23:00.160 --> 23:01.600
I'm just trying to see if you...

23:01.620 --> 23:03.860
Listen, man, I-I... Like...

23:03.900 --> 23:05.860
I'm not even gonna hold you,
man. We just lost the tour.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.810
- And I might even do this movie
- I... already know.

23:07.830 --> 23:09.999
- just to make ends.
- Yeah. You good. We good.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.370
- We good, yeah. Yeah.
- A'ight. Yeah.

23:12.410 --> 23:13.800
Yeah.

23:14.410 --> 23:16.440
Hey.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.440
Andy. Whatever it is, man,

23:19.480 --> 23:21.510
you can make it to the other side.

23:21.550 --> 23:24.380
I know that 'cause I've been there.

23:24.420 --> 23:25.940
You're gonna be all right.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.020
All right?

23:34.260 --> 23:36.260
- Holla at me.
- Yeah!

23:36.300 --> 23:38.560
Yeah.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.010
Miss Ruby,

23:47.040 --> 23:49.370
nobody's coming in here.

23:51.650 --> 23:53.920
I promise.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.340
You?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.360
A lot of things you don't know about me.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.500
Also, I've snuck a few
of your joints before.

24:18.410 --> 24:21.140
Helps with my PTSD.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.540
There was a girl.

24:27.750 --> 24:30.650
Bianca.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.350
She was sitting next to me.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.760
On the plane.

24:37.790 --> 24:41.430
She died because of me.

24:41.460 --> 24:44.200
She died because they took
me off the plane first.

24:44.230 --> 24:48.000
It wasn't your fault.

24:48.030 --> 24:51.440
Neither is what happened to you.

24:52.610 --> 24:55.240
I don't know...

24:55.280 --> 24:58.210
I've lived in this house
for over 20 years.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.580
Raised my boys here.

25:03.780 --> 25:07.790
Mourned my husband and my son here,

25:07.820 --> 25:10.960
and, uh, I've earned the right.

25:10.990 --> 25:15.000
I've paid for the right
to have a safe home,

25:15.040 --> 25:18.360
and he just took it.

25:23.870 --> 25:25.900
Don't let him take another damn thing,

25:25.970 --> 25:29.070
Miss Ruby.

25:30.680 --> 25:33.280
Jayden drew this.

25:33.310 --> 25:35.250
That's Jahil.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.180
Kids these days, boy.

25:38.220 --> 25:40.040
They see too much.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.540
What am I supposed to tell him?

25:41.640 --> 25:43.350
Jahil's murderer is still out there

25:43.390 --> 25:45.120
and we not gonna do anything?

25:45.160 --> 25:47.220
Look, Cotton, your
father was a good man,

25:47.240 --> 25:49.360
but he did a lot of dirt.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.900
Now, the last thing he would want

25:50.930 --> 25:52.580
is you caught up in his mess.

25:52.740 --> 25:54.770
He would want you to try to move on.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.030
Move on?

25:56.070 --> 25:58.700
Is that what you call what you doing?

25:58.740 --> 26:01.410
All you do is work,
Mama, you never home.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.410
I'm just trying to honor his
memory by living his dream.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.940
<i>His</i> dream. Not yours.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.110
He should be here living it.

26:09.150 --> 26:12.950
Cotton, I don't want you out
there doing nothing crazy.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.750
Promise me you won't.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.990
Mama, I can't.

26:17.020 --> 26:18.690
I already talked to Titi Cassie.

26:18.730 --> 26:20.690
She gonna help me since you not.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.340
Y'all got a minute?

26:36.460 --> 26:38.740
I'd like to audition for the lead role.

26:40.910 --> 26:43.050
I'm sorry, Simone,
that's not gonna happen.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.550
I mean, y'all are
considering my sister Star.

26:45.590 --> 26:47.266
Because she's
already well-positioned.

26:47.290 --> 26:48.920
Her single is still on the charts.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.570
She has name recognition,
and, of course...

26:50.590 --> 26:51.900
You know what? If y'all
had a real vision,

26:51.920 --> 26:54.090
you'd realize I'm what
you're looking for.

26:54.130 --> 26:56.730
I grew up in foster care. I was abused.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.900
My mother was a junkie
and I was in juvie.

26:59.020 --> 27:01.070
I don't just relate to this character,

27:01.100 --> 27:04.300
I am this character, and
I know I can play her.

27:06.280 --> 27:07.870
Simone Davis, right?

27:07.910 --> 27:10.980
Yes, that's my name.

27:11.010 --> 27:13.140
And if you ever come
after my sister again,

27:13.180 --> 27:14.726
I swear to God, I'll
check your ass so fast,

27:14.750 --> 27:17.560
you'll never forget it.

27:20.420 --> 27:22.350
I'm looking for Mateo.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.290
He said to meet him here about a movie.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.560
Actually, that was me trying
to get you down here.

27:26.590 --> 27:29.330
I'm in business with Maurice Jetter.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.576
I'm not interested, all right?
And he already knows that.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.900
But wait. You haven't heard
my side of the story yet.

27:34.930 --> 27:36.570
I'm his partner, Cassie Brown.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.520
Carlotta's sister.

27:38.660 --> 27:40.770
Look, me and Maurice
got big plans, Noah.

27:40.810 --> 27:43.810
This is gonna be one of the
hottest live music venues

27:43.840 --> 27:47.110
in the city... with Noah Brooks
as the artist-in-residence.

27:47.150 --> 27:48.840
If you can get your head far enough out

27:48.860 --> 27:50.220
of your ass to think big.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.596
Look, I-I'm supposed to be prepping for

27:51.620 --> 27:53.330
- a movie role right now, I...
- Listen up, Noah.

27:53.350 --> 27:55.660
You ain't no ho-type artist.

27:55.800 --> 27:56.950
You're a king.

27:56.990 --> 27:59.920
So be a king and let
this be your castle.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.280
But I'm not looking for change.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.630
Nobody's ever looking.

28:06.670 --> 28:10.040

Noah.

29:31.140 --> 29:32.320
Feel me?

29:32.350 --> 29:35.790
Look, whatever you're offering,
I'm with it. All right?

29:35.820 --> 29:37.560
But it has to go through Carlotta.

29:37.590 --> 29:40.040
Why? What does Carlotta
got to do with this?

29:40.100 --> 29:42.630
Like I told Maurice, I'm not
doing nothing without her.

29:42.710 --> 29:45.750
But if you're looking for a
hungry artist to get onstage,

29:45.780 --> 29:47.230
I can link y'all up with my boy Andy.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.350
Andy?

29:48.380 --> 29:49.820
Yeah, he used to work with Jahil.

29:49.850 --> 29:51.050
I mean, he can blow.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.850
He just got back in town.

29:52.890 --> 29:55.160
Yeah. Yeah, send him my way.

29:55.190 --> 29:56.790
I'm always looking for fresh meat.

29:56.830 --> 29:59.940
- Bet.
- Bet.

30:12.440 --> 30:15.120
I'll be right back, okay?

30:17.720 --> 30:19.660
Hey, excuse me.

30:19.690 --> 30:21.420
We've been waiting for hours.

30:21.460 --> 30:22.730
I'm sorry, ma'am, for what?

30:22.760 --> 30:24.090
What do you mean "for what"?

30:24.130 --> 30:25.830
A rape kit.

30:25.860 --> 30:28.320
We were told to sit and wait
and no one's come in yet.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.879
We only have one nurse on site

30:29.880 --> 30:31.380
that can process these kits.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.070
And tonight we've had
four come in alone.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.740
Look, she's old and scared.

30:35.770 --> 30:38.170
- And none of this is her fault.
- I know.

30:38.210 --> 30:39.600
Maybe if she can come back tomorrow.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.580
We're not going anywhere.

30:41.610 --> 30:43.880
Get us some help right now!

30:43.920 --> 30:46.280
I'll try to find the nurse.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.400
I've got you.

31:00.570 --> 31:03.320

31:24.940 --> 31:26.166
throw a little hot sauce in there,

31:26.190 --> 31:28.620
and slap your throat three
times. You'll be all right.

31:28.690 --> 31:30.640
You know, there's only thing
I've been good at my whole life?

31:30.660 --> 31:33.180
- One thing I could count on.
- Sure ain't been listening.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.730
No, it's singing, Bruce. And
I can't even do that now.

31:35.770 --> 31:37.270
I'm done.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.600
And I definitely don't have
time for your energy right now.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.716
What the hell is your problem?

31:41.740 --> 31:43.480
Child, her throat done went out.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.940
Is that like a pregnancy
thing or something?

31:45.980 --> 31:49.650
No, it's like a "my whole
damn life" thing, Simone.

31:49.680 --> 31:52.100
I got the entire world
attacking me, including you,

31:52.120 --> 31:53.780
and now my body's attacking me.

31:53.890 --> 31:58.050
Yeah, well, just bulldoze
'em, Star, okay?

31:58.090 --> 32:00.660
You hear me?

32:00.690 --> 32:02.860
Why are you trying to
play my sister now?

32:02.890 --> 32:05.290
Look. I know that I said

32:05.330 --> 32:08.000
I didn't feel like you
were ready, but...

32:08.030 --> 32:10.300
you could prove me wrong.

32:10.330 --> 32:12.900
You could prove everybody
wrong like you always do.

32:13.480 --> 32:16.510
- Is this some kind of apology?
- No, not really.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.879
- Sounds like an apology.
- No.

32:17.880 --> 32:19.710
Feels like an apology.

32:19.740 --> 32:22.060
I see you guys are talking again.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.700
Where the hell have you been?

32:23.820 --> 32:27.080
Uh, Miss Ruby needed me.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.750
Mm, she needed some weed?

32:30.760 --> 32:34.620
- So y'all are codependent again?
- Shut up, Alex.

32:34.660 --> 32:37.040
I had to Iyanla Star's ass
because her voice is hoarse

32:37.060 --> 32:38.790
and these trolls are coming in hard.

32:38.830 --> 32:40.596
You know, I'm really sick
of people just saying

32:40.620 --> 32:42.900
whatever they want, and
not thinking about

32:42.930 --> 32:45.570
how they can hurt people.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.770
All of us included.

32:47.810 --> 32:49.350
Well, we should
fight back, you know?

32:49.370 --> 32:50.900
We should check these bitches who think

32:50.920 --> 32:53.440
that they can disrespect
us and do what we do best.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.110
We have to finish this song.

32:55.150 --> 32:57.210
Hell yes, Simone.

32:57.250 --> 33:01.440
You know, I really need that
today, too, so it works out.

33:01.590 --> 33:03.520
Me, too.

33:03.550 --> 33:06.420
But first, some hot water
and lemon and hot sauce

33:06.440 --> 33:07.860
and whatever else you
were talking about.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.890
Slap your throat three times.

33:09.930 --> 33:12.390
Huh?

33:15.730 --> 33:18.430
Stay the hell away from my child.

33:20.440 --> 33:22.870
I'm gonna talk to my
niece when I want to.

33:22.910 --> 33:24.540
And tell her more lies?

33:24.580 --> 33:27.060
'Cause you and I both know you
can't tell her the truth.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.260
It'd just break her heart.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.839
You know I didn't mean to hurt her.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.950
You never mean to hurt nobody

33:31.980 --> 33:33.660
with your stupid ass.

33:35.220 --> 33:38.020
Always so high and mighty.

33:38.060 --> 33:40.390
But guess what. The word on the street

33:40.420 --> 33:42.600
is you not running Midtown no more,

33:42.620 --> 33:45.090
or should I say Gravity Records?

33:45.130 --> 33:47.230
That don't have nothing to do

33:47.270 --> 33:48.760
with you staying away from Cotton.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.470
Oh, but it does.

33:50.500 --> 33:53.870
See, you turned your back on
family to focus on business,

33:53.910 --> 33:57.320
and now business is turning
its back on you, huh?

33:58.800 --> 34:01.210
The suit don't make the boss, sis.

34:01.250 --> 34:04.050
If Cotton knew what you did,

34:04.080 --> 34:07.020
she'd hate you even more
than I do right now.

34:07.050 --> 34:09.000
Now why don't you go get
your own life, Cassie,

34:09.040 --> 34:10.489
and stay your ass out of mine?

34:10.520 --> 34:12.560
Oh, bitch, I've just begun.

34:12.590 --> 34:16.560

34:16.590 --> 34:19.480

So I just busted through

they're gonna have to listen
to what I have to say.

38:00.110 --> 38:01.740

Babe, it's okay. You can say it.

38:22.860 --> 38:25.370
You know, nobody has ever believed in me

38:25.400 --> 38:27.700
the way that you have, Angel.

38:27.740 --> 38:31.370
And I love you for that,

her to get some rest.

39:04.110 --> 39:06.480
Thank you for getting
her to the hospital.

39:10.610 --> 39:14.050

39:16.320 --> 39:18.200

She's right.

39:31.430 --> 39:34.340
I don't think I have
faith in neither of 'em.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.410
You don't have to be strong for me.

39:46.680 --> 39:49.520
It's okay to let go, baby.

39:50.950 --> 39:52.740
It's okay.

39:56.160 --> 40:00.260
Girl, look at this. We got
our own little Starhive.

40:00.300 --> 40:02.930
- Starlets.
- That's good.

40:02.960 --> 40:06.070
Maybe now they'll stop
asking me who the daddy is.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.990
Except me. Yes, ho, I'm nosy.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Who is it?

40:10.040 --> 40:13.310
It don't matter. Fathers leave.

40:13.340 --> 40:16.320
Fathers break your heart. That's it.

40:16.360 --> 40:17.999
So, if I can spare my child from that,

40:20.560 --> 40:22.249
to not let Jahil be in my life.

40:22.250 --> 40:25.590
A-And now that he's gone, I wish
that I had all that time back.

40:25.620 --> 40:28.659

not passing your mess

40:28.660 --> 40:29.690
