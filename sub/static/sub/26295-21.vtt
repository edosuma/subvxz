WEBVTT

00:06.658 --> 00:09.226
All right, okay.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.576
Uh, coming.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.710
- Morning.
- Hey.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.209
- Are you guys ready to go?
- Getting there.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.452
Emily's still in the bathroom.

00:17.495 --> 00:19.062
She's gonna make us late again.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.586
- Ethan, hold on.
- Em!

00:21.630 --> 00:22.674
Hey!

00:22.718 --> 00:24.807
Em, hurry up!

00:24.850 --> 00:27.331
Can I just have, like,
20 more minutes, please?

00:27.375 --> 00:28.985
We have to get to work.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.007
Look, I'm covered in spit up.
I haven't showered in days.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.425
I'm... look, I'm so exhausted.
Okay, Em, take your time.

00:34.469 --> 00:35.663
You're going to visit Bernie,
right?

00:35.687 --> 00:37.298
Yeah.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.840
We'll take Vincent
and meet you at the hospital.

00:38.864 --> 00:41.215
Oh, thank you so much, April.

00:42.477 --> 00:43.913
Don't say it. I know.

00:43.956 --> 00:45.586
Take Vincent so I can
finish getting ready.

00:45.610 --> 00:46.568
Thank you.

00:46.611 --> 00:47.699
All right.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.809
I saw that they just
put Sophie's surgery

00:50.833 --> 00:52.530
on the schedule.
How's Phillip holding up?

00:52.574 --> 00:54.141
Oh, he's trying
to stay positive.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.422
He's looking forward
to being on the other side

00:55.446 --> 00:56.708
- of it, though.
- Oh, yeah.

00:56.752 --> 00:59.102
In other news,
a little birdie told me

00:59.146 --> 01:00.712
it was your birthday today.
Oh, yeah?

01:00.756 --> 01:02.975
Did that little birdie happen
to have long, dark hair?

01:03.019 --> 01:05.500
- Don't look at me.
- I never reveal my sources.

01:05.543 --> 01:06.979
- Mm-hmm.
- So any plans tonight?

01:07.023 --> 01:08.633
No, just dinner with Robin.

01:08.677 --> 01:11.201
So you and Robin have been
spending some time together.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.725
You thinking about rekindling?
Wow.

01:13.769 --> 01:16.815
You are just brimming with
curiosity today, aren't you?

01:16.859 --> 01:18.861
- Mm-hmm.
- Maggie.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.125
You want me to turn the air on?

01:22.169 --> 01:23.581
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I always run hot.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.433
Well, you got through
the polar vortex.

01:25.476 --> 01:28.392
And now you just have
the sweltering Chicago summer

01:28.436 --> 01:30.002
to look forward to.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.763
I'm gonna skip town
before that heat wave hits.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.224
What, you going on
some cruise I don't know about?

01:34.268 --> 01:38.881
Actually, I'm... I'm heading
back to Minneapolis.

01:38.924 --> 01:40.100
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.405
What, for the weekend?

01:41.449 --> 01:45.235
Um, I was gonna fill
you in later.

01:45.279 --> 01:47.281
Hamline made me an offer
I couldn't refuse

01:47.324 --> 01:49.544
to go back and teach,
so I'm going to tie up

01:49.587 --> 01:51.894
some loose ends here
and then head back in a week.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.681
Well... well, what about...
What about the trial?

01:56.725 --> 01:58.901
What about the...
Your clinical trial?

01:58.944 --> 02:01.947
They're gonna let me continue
my treatment back home.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.865
- It's good.
- Congratulations.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.301
Thank you.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.235
Guess it'll be good to sleep
in your own bed again.

02:10.259 --> 02:12.741
Yeah, yeah. And you know what?

02:12.784 --> 02:16.484
I'm gonna get in that claw-foot
tub you tried to fight me for.

02:16.527 --> 02:21.184
You offered that woman
$10 more than I paid.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.055
You ain't right.
That's a great tub.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.321
Your echo report looks good.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.410
You're gonna have to continue
cardiac rehab

02:29.453 --> 02:31.499
for a couple of weeks.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.762
But best guess,
you're going home tomorrow.

02:33.805 --> 02:35.024
Well, thank God.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.721
'Cause that chef can't make
a poached egg

02:36.765 --> 02:37.809
to save his life.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.333
All the money I'm spending here,

02:39.376 --> 02:42.292
this place should be
Michelin starred.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.009
Look, Dad, I've got to run,
but I'll be back

02:44.033 --> 02:46.209
to check in later.

02:46.253 --> 02:49.212
Hey, before you go,

02:49.256 --> 02:50.822
happy birthday.

02:52.346 --> 02:55.479
- Shocked I remembered?
- Yeah, frankly.

02:55.523 --> 02:59.091
Well, I will admit
that I almost forgot.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.964
But Carlotta was cleaning out
the attic a few weeks ago

03:02.007 --> 03:04.314
and she found your old
Ninja Turtle mask...

03:04.358 --> 03:05.881
From my seventh birthday?

03:05.924 --> 03:07.665
- Yes.
- Wow, yeah.

03:07.709 --> 03:11.060
Uh, Mom made that Donatello
birthday cake from scratch.

03:11.103 --> 03:15.064
She planned every detail.
You mean your nanny.

03:15.107 --> 03:16.674
No, I mean Mom.

03:16.718 --> 03:19.199
Mom was having
a depressive episode.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.026
She'd been in bed for weeks.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.854
That's not how I remember it.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.641
That doesn't surprise me.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.556
Now, what is that
supposed to mean?

03:28.599 --> 03:31.167
You always paint me
as the absentee father

03:31.211 --> 03:34.039
and your mother as the saint,
and I'm telling you

03:34.083 --> 03:35.737
your nanny planned the party.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.304
I paid for it.

03:37.347 --> 03:38.653
And your mom never came.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.437
Why do you feel the need
to disparage her?

03:40.481 --> 03:41.806
- I'm not disparaging her.
- Yes, you are.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.701
- No, I'm not!
- You do this every time.

03:45.399 --> 03:48.924
- I'll... I'll come back later.
- No, you stay.

03:48.967 --> 03:49.967
I'm leaving.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.283
Need some help out here.
Got a patient down.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.894
Get a gurney out there.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.941
She's seizing.
She looks like she's full term.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.290
Must be eclamptic.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.734
Lucy, get me ten grams
of magnesium.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.641
- On it.
- Name's Desiree Parker.

04:10.685 --> 04:13.253
She had just signed in.
Husband went to park the car.

04:13.296 --> 04:16.343
Desiree, I'm Dr. Manning.
Can you tell me where you are?

04:16.386 --> 04:18.040
- What? What?
- You're in a hospital.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.303
You just had a seizure.
Let's get her on the backboard.

04:20.346 --> 04:23.480
Yes, Doctor.
Gonna get you into the ER.

04:23.524 --> 04:25.066
All right,
let's lift her on my count.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.049
Ready? One, two, three.

04:29.791 --> 04:32.097
All right.

04:32.141 --> 04:33.708
She's seizing again. Lucy!

04:33.751 --> 04:35.797
- Excuse us.
- Injecting magnesium.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.459
The magnesium isn't working.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.983
Let's get her two milligrams
of Ativan IM.

04:48.026 --> 04:50.768
Let's check her vitals
and get her some oxygen.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:01.692 --> 05:03.627
Well, there's the fetus
but she's not even close

05:03.651 --> 05:07.219
to full term.
Maybe 20, 21 weeks.

05:07.263 --> 05:09.526
But she's so big.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.573
Whoa, that's all free fluid.
Maybe she's cirrhotic.

05:12.616 --> 05:15.140
No, no, she has cancer.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.968
My wife.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.362
She has ovarian cancer.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.190
Stage four.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.813
Thanks.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.817
What is it? What's wrong?

05:39.861 --> 05:41.297
- Honey.
- It's okay.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.735
Um, Desi, your CT scan
shows that your cancer

05:44.779 --> 05:47.390
has metastasized to your brain.

05:47.434 --> 05:48.522
Oh, God.

05:50.132 --> 05:53.962
There's a large tumor
on your right temporal lobe.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.398
That's what caused your seizure.

05:58.532 --> 05:59.837
I knew the risk I was taking

05:59.881 --> 06:01.535
when I decided
against treatment.

06:01.578 --> 06:04.407
Yeah, we, uh,

06:04.451 --> 06:07.105
got the diagnosis when we were
three months along

06:07.149 --> 06:10.413
with the pregnancy. With Elijah.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.937
That's his name.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.635
I was already stage four.

06:14.678 --> 06:17.420
It was highly unlikely that
treatment would be successful.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.596
Unlikely, not impossible.

06:21.468 --> 06:22.904
I didn't want any interventions

06:22.947 --> 06:25.167
that could harm the baby.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.690
What are our options?

06:26.734 --> 06:29.432
Well, given the size
and location of the tumor,

06:29.476 --> 06:32.783
um, a craniotomy is recommended
to resect it.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.306
Brain surgery?

06:34.350 --> 06:36.308
That could hurt Elijah, right?

06:36.352 --> 06:38.528
Well, they would take
every precaution,

06:38.572 --> 06:42.402
but, yes, general anesthesia
does pose a small risk

06:42.445 --> 06:44.491
for the fetus.
Then, no, I won't do it.

06:44.534 --> 06:45.927
Desi, we agreed

06:45.970 --> 06:47.774
not to take treatment
off the table completely,

06:47.798 --> 06:49.931
especially as
circumstances evolve.

06:55.197 --> 06:57.025
Could you give us some time
to discuss it?

06:57.068 --> 06:58.809
Of course.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.167
Getting dolled up.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.342
Where you headed?

07:10.386 --> 07:12.693
Having breakfast with my sister.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.651
- Oh, Denise is in town?
- Mm-hmm.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.131
Third time this month.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.873
Little sneak's been dating
someone in Streeterville.

07:18.916 --> 07:22.050
Finally agreed to make
the introductions.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.052
Does she...

07:24.095 --> 07:25.445
Never mind.

07:25.488 --> 07:28.665
No, spit it out.

07:28.709 --> 07:32.495
Probably a dumb question,
but does she date men or women?

07:33.801 --> 07:36.847
Oh, well, every trans woman
is different.

07:36.891 --> 07:40.111
But Denise dates men.

07:40.155 --> 07:43.332
Speaking of... Denise!

07:43.375 --> 07:47.684
Look at you! You look awesome!

07:47.728 --> 07:49.730
Oh, stop it. Hey, Will.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.993
- Hi.
- I'm serious.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.473
She isn't lying.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.692
Well, if I look good,
I owe it to Trevor.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.215
We've been on a low carb kick.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.087
Um, no, you can thank
your folks for that.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.697
I see good genes
run in the family.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.960
Okay.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.528
He's a keeper.
Trevor, this is Will Halstead.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.095
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.749
I got you covered. Have fun.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.228
Thank you. Well, come on.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.447
Yeah, good luck, man.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.642
You're gonna need it
with those two.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.406
Okay.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.930
Ow!

08:15.973 --> 08:17.497
Matt Jacobson, 14-year-old male.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.900
Fell attempting
a skateboard trick.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.195
It hurts!

08:20.238 --> 08:21.477
Complaining of pain
to the left forearm.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.241
- Vitals stable.
- All right.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.263
You notify his parents?
Uh, dad's right behind us.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.245
Keep breathing, kid.
I know that it hurts.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.552
Just try to keep breathing.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.381
He, uh, was screaming his
head off the whole way here.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.078
- Oh!
- All right.

08:34.121 --> 08:37.125
On my count. One, two, three.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.563
Thank you, you guys.

08:41.607 --> 08:44.087
Hey, Matt, did you put your
arms out in front of you

08:44.131 --> 08:46.134
to break your fall?
I can't remember.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.484
- Ow!
- All right, easy there.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.139
Breath sounds are normal.
Dad, did you see what happened?

08:51.182 --> 08:52.575
No, I was in the house.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.229
I got to him as quick
as I could.

08:54.272 --> 08:56.318
But I don't move so fast. Yeah.

08:56.361 --> 08:57.711
Oh!

08:57.754 --> 08:58.992
All right, Matt,
can you move your head for me?

08:59.016 --> 09:00.583
My arm hurts so bad.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.735
All right, just touch your
chin to your chest, then.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.413
Make it stop hurting, please!

09:04.456 --> 09:06.546
He's too distracted
to clear the C-spine.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.635
Let's take care of his pain
and then we'll reassess.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.593
Monique, get a line in
and give 4 of morphine.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.596
No, no, no, I hate needles.
Can't you give me pills?

09:13.640 --> 09:15.511
They're gonna take a lot
longer to work, bud.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.774
- I don't want a needle.
- Just give him a pill.

09:17.818 --> 09:20.255
Please.

09:20.298 --> 09:23.301
All right, fine.
Uh, give 7.5 hydrocodone.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.826
Once the pain subsides,
we'll do a chest x-ray,

09:25.869 --> 09:29.394
AP and lateral x-rays
of both arms.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.614
Be right back, okay?

09:31.658 --> 09:33.877
It hurts. Oh.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.140
Dr. Rhodes, you smell alcohol

09:36.184 --> 09:38.055
- on dad's breath?
- Oh, yeah.

09:38.099 --> 09:41.319
- He reeked of it.
- It hurts!

09:41.363 --> 09:42.756
Ah!

09:46.803 --> 09:48.196
Hey.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.806
Just the lady I was looking for.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.329
Uh-oh. What's up?

09:51.373 --> 09:53.505
You still friendly
with the chairman

09:53.549 --> 09:56.160
of the anthropology department
at University of Chicago?

09:56.204 --> 09:59.337
Yes, I just saw him
last weekend at a fundraiser

09:59.381 --> 10:00.643
for the Boys & Girls Club. Why?

10:00.687 --> 10:02.427
Well, you know,
they've been trying

10:02.471 --> 10:03.994
to recruit Cece for years.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.996
And I was just thinking...
Daniel.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.519
What? Oh, come on.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.975
They would jump
at the opportunity to have her

10:08.999 --> 10:10.435
on the faculty.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.437
And let's face it,
she should stay in Chicago

10:12.481 --> 10:14.309
and stick with
the same medical team.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.833
Why don't you just
tell her how you feel?

10:16.877 --> 10:19.444
Do you have the number?

10:19.488 --> 10:22.186
- All right.
- Send it to me.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.797
Sent.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.494
Thank you.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.980
Emily should be here soon.
I'll hang with him till then.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.372
All right, I... I can take him.

10:34.416 --> 10:37.419
He's still sleeping. I got it.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.291
Thank you.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.167
Hey.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.995
You got a pep in your step.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.233
Trevor knock it out of the park?

10:49.257 --> 10:50.693
The guy's a prince.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.913
I can't believe Denise
kept him hidden for so long.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.655
Poor thing was so nervous,
she didn't eat a bite.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.110
Well, maybe she was worried
her big sister

10:57.134 --> 10:58.875
wouldn't approve.

10:58.919 --> 11:01.443
I mean, you can be a little
judgmental at times.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.314
I think you mean discerning.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.447
Whatever.
Where are you going, anyway?

11:05.490 --> 11:07.667
Forgot my phone in the car.
Be back in a sec.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.581
All right.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.159
Hey!

11:22.203 --> 11:23.813
Denise.

11:26.773 --> 11:29.253
Hey, Denise.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.734
You all right? I'm fine, really.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.344
Oh, your lip's bleeding.
Let me...

11:33.388 --> 11:36.086
I said I'm fine.
I just need to call me an Uber.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.045
Listen, why don't
you come inside?

11:38.088 --> 11:39.568
Let me check you out properly.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.154
Looks like you're banged up
pretty good.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.267
I'm not coming inside, Will.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.878
And you can't mention
this to Maggie.

11:44.921 --> 11:48.708
Promise me.
I won't mention it to Maggie.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.622
But you got to
let me examine you.

11:50.666 --> 11:51.754
I don't...

11:52.973 --> 11:54.844
Denise?

11:54.888 --> 11:57.629
Whoa. Denise.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.501
Denise?

12:05.028 --> 12:06.769
Denise? Oh, my God.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.031
- What happened?
- She fainted.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.641
Where? How?

12:09.685 --> 12:11.556
And where's Trevor?

12:11.600 --> 12:13.863
He had to, um...

12:13.907 --> 12:15.711
Let her fill you in
when she's feeling better.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.780
Is treatment four open?

12:17.824 --> 12:20.217
Okay. Here, this way.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.393
All right.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.787
Given the kid's description
of what happened,

12:24.831 --> 12:27.181
I'd expect a Colles
or Smith fracture.

12:27.224 --> 12:30.401
But this is not
a fracture from a fall.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.838
And with the bruising pattern,

12:31.881 --> 12:33.840
I'd say he was struck
with something.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.365
Like a cane.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.759
You think his father did this?

12:39.802 --> 12:41.717
I think there's
a strong possibility, yeah.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.242
It's odd, though,
that he brought his son in.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.897
I mean, usually they try
to hide the abuse

12:47.941 --> 12:49.899
or delay seeking
medical treatment.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.747
Mm-mm, there's something
off here, Miss Goodwin.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.468
I-I know it.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.948
Okay.

12:54.991 --> 12:58.168
Pull social work in to do
an evaluation and have them

12:58.212 --> 13:00.475
check for any pending
or prior claims of abuse,

13:00.518 --> 13:05.349
but let's wait to involve DCFS
until we're absolutely sure.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.482
- Of course. Thank you.
- All right.

13:10.311 --> 13:14.663
Dr. Rhodes, Matt's requesting
more meds for the pain.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.839
Really? Oh, come on.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.755
That kid is 120 pounds
soaking wet.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.844
He's had two tabs
of hydrocodone.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.499
He should be high as a kite.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.109
Do me a favor.

13:26.153 --> 13:30.374
Get a new urine sample
and run a tox.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.723
On it.

13:35.553 --> 13:38.034
Caleb, I was just headed to you.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.123
Have you and Desi made
a decision about surgery?

13:40.167 --> 13:43.474
Uh, not exactly. Um, can we...?

13:43.518 --> 13:44.824
Sure.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.565
My wife and I,
we agreed that if the cancer

13:47.609 --> 13:51.308
progressed quickly that
she would reconsider treatment.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.615
The tumor in her brain,
it could be impairing

13:53.658 --> 13:54.877
her judgment, right?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.748
Yes, it's a possibility, but...

13:56.792 --> 13:59.969
So maybe she can't
make this decision.

14:00.013 --> 14:02.015
Caleb, I understand that
you're overwhelmed,

14:02.058 --> 14:04.036
but Desi did appear to have
all of her faculties...

14:04.060 --> 14:06.193
Hey, I know my wife.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.456
She's not thinking clearly.
I'm telling you.

14:09.936 --> 14:13.156
Okay, um, I will have
the head of psychiatry

14:13.200 --> 14:15.767
- evaluate Desi.
- Thank you.

14:18.683 --> 14:21.382
You said she fainted.
What happened to her face?

14:21.425 --> 14:24.864
Her lip is busted.
It looks like she got hit.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.346
I told you you're gonna have
to talk to your sister.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.610
Wait.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.003
Did Trevor do this?

14:39.835 --> 14:41.706
So this is why you didn't
want us to meet.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.883
- You told her?
- He didn't have to.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.382
How long has Trevor been
putting his hands on you?

14:45.406 --> 14:48.365
He hasn't.
He just lost his temper today.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.890
It's my fault.
I was pushing his buttons.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.457
- We have to call the cops.
- Don't!

14:53.501 --> 14:55.198
Say anything and I'll deny it.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.853
Why?
What is wrong with you, Denise?

14:57.897 --> 15:00.203
No, I don't expect you
to understand, okay?

15:00.247 --> 15:01.813
Look, Trevor may not be perfect,

15:01.857 --> 15:03.728
but at least he loves me for me.

15:03.772 --> 15:06.383
Loves you?
This man doesn't love you.

15:06.427 --> 15:10.344
He preys on you.
He preys on you because he can.

15:10.387 --> 15:13.129
- Mags, let me talk to you.
- Look at your face!

15:13.173 --> 15:15.915
Come on. Let's go.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.438
Denise, sit tight.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.962
I'm gonna have plastics come
take a look at that lip.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.225
- What?
- Listen.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.662
You shoot from the hip
and we all love that about you,

15:24.706 --> 15:27.883
but maybe try a softer approach.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.625
Sometimes the truth hurts.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.509
What's going on?

15:45.553 --> 15:48.034
I couldn't find Emily.
She wasn't in Bernie's room.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.470
He said she hasn't come by yet.

15:49.513 --> 15:50.688
I'll call her.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.516
I did already.
She didn't pick up.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.953
I left a voicemail.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.824
She had a really rough
night with Vincent.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.497
I don't think she slept
more than an hour.

15:57.521 --> 15:59.088
I know it's a lot.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.786
I just hope she's not falling
back to her old ways.

16:01.830 --> 16:05.051
Well, she's made a lot of
strides these last few months.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.749
Let's try to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.185
All right.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.946
I'll run Vincent down
to the daycare center,

16:10.970 --> 16:13.885
see if they have room for him.
Okay.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.627
Hi, buddy. Hello.

16:18.890 --> 16:22.416
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.333
Hey, Desi. How are you feeling?

16:26.376 --> 16:29.292
Okay. Just a bit, um, drowsy.

16:29.336 --> 16:32.165
That's from the Ativan.
Should wear off soon.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.862
In the meantime,
I wanted to introduce you

16:33.905 --> 16:36.604
to Dr. Charles.
He's our head of psychiatry.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.388
Psychiatrist. Why?

16:38.432 --> 16:40.584
Desiree, I just wanna ask you
a couple of quick questions

16:40.608 --> 16:44.742
if that's okay.
You can-me... Desi.

16:44.786 --> 16:47.180
- I'm sorry?
- Call me...

16:47.223 --> 16:48.703
Bag her.

16:48.746 --> 16:51.445
Desi!

16:51.488 --> 16:52.272
What's going on?

16:52.315 --> 16:55.014
Let's give them some room.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.016
Her right pupil is dilated
and sluggish.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.105
I need to tube her
and send her to CT stat.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.455
I suspect edema.
It's a swelling in the brain.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.239
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.807
- Do the surgery!
- Mr. Parker...

17:05.849 --> 17:08.069
I'm her surrogate
decision maker.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.071
I said do it. Now.

17:13.944 --> 17:15.164
Where are the pills?

17:15.208 --> 17:16.707
I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:16.731 --> 17:17.949
Did you take them already?

17:17.992 --> 17:20.213
Just tell me.
Where are the pills?

17:20.256 --> 17:22.780
Hey, hey.
What's going on in here?

17:22.824 --> 17:25.566
Guy abused his son
and came here to score opioids.

17:25.608 --> 17:28.308
- Are you insane?
- I ran a tox on Matt.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.397
He hasn't taken any
of the pills we've given him.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.095
Meanwhile I search the Illinois
Prescription Database.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.706
Turns out Mr. Jacobson here
has been flagged

17:35.750 --> 17:37.621
as a frequent flyer.

17:37.665 --> 17:41.408
I swear to God I didn't lay
a hand on my son.

17:41.451 --> 17:44.498
And I sure as hell didn't
take his pain meds!

17:44.541 --> 17:46.282
Take a drug test
to prove it, then.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.110
I don't have to prove
anything to you!

17:48.154 --> 17:49.720
All right, look,
I have a better idea.

17:49.764 --> 17:52.810
Why don't we all go speak
with Matt, all right?

17:52.854 --> 17:53.942
Please.

17:59.948 --> 18:01.123
I took the pills.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.169
Dr. Rhodes ran a tox screen,
Matt.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.823
They're not in your system. So?

18:05.867 --> 18:07.216
Maybe the test was wrong.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.715
We're going around
in circles, Miss Goodwin.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.001
That's it.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.091
I'm calling Child
Protective Services.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.963
No. No, my dad never touched me.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.399
Please don't call them.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.013
They're right here.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.798
Fine, he told him
to pocket them.

18:23.841 --> 18:24.973
Dr. Rhodes.

18:29.891 --> 18:32.372
How did you hurt
yourself today, Matt?

18:32.415 --> 18:34.896
Did you really fall off
your skateboard?

18:38.073 --> 18:42.164
Son. Just tell us the truth.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.905
You won't get in trouble.

18:45.602 --> 18:49.432
- I slammed my arm in the door.
- On purpose?

18:52.261 --> 18:54.872
I'm so sorry, Dad.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.918
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.573
I just wanted to help you.

19:08.451 --> 19:13.456
I got into a awful car wreck
about ten years ago.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.198
My back's been
a mess ever since.

19:16.242 --> 19:19.462
Doc had me on Oxy which was
working pretty well,

19:19.506 --> 19:21.899
but then some new
government guidelines,

19:21.943 --> 19:23.510
something came out.

19:23.553 --> 19:27.427
Yes, the CDC introduced new
prescribing recommendations.

19:27.470 --> 19:30.691
A response to the opioid crisis.

19:30.734 --> 19:35.391
With opioids, there is always
the concern with, um,

19:35.435 --> 19:36.871
overdose or misuse.

19:36.914 --> 19:39.439
Yeah, well, I wasn't misusing.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.572
Hit up just about every doctor
in the city.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.444
But no one would write me
a new prescription.

19:44.487 --> 19:47.925
And how are you currently
managing your pain?

19:51.146 --> 19:52.843
Drinking, mostly.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.371
I thought I did
a better job hiding it.

20:00.286 --> 20:04.246
But, God, I can't believe
he'd personally harm himself

20:04.290 --> 20:08.729
to try and get me pills.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.252
Well, Mr. Jacobson,
I'll give you

20:10.296 --> 20:13.168
the contact information
of a general practitioner

20:13.212 --> 20:14.387
in Schaumburg.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.519
I'm confident he'll be able
to help you.

20:16.563 --> 20:19.174
- I appreciate it.
- Sure.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.046
Mr. Jacobson, um,

20:22.090 --> 20:26.094
for what it's worth,
I am very, very sorry.

20:36.452 --> 20:37.975
I apologize, Miss Goodwin.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.848
I... I just... I...

20:40.891 --> 20:44.721
Oh, I can't believe
that I was so off base.

20:44.765 --> 20:48.551
Well, I appreciate
your intent, Dr. Rhodes.

20:48.595 --> 20:51.598
But next time just
ask more questions

20:51.641 --> 20:53.600
before you start accusing.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.107
Well, Denise, your blood
sugar's pretty low.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.959
I suspect that's what
caused you to faint.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.830
'Cause you haven't
been eating enough.

21:06.874 --> 21:09.746
Thanks to Trevor. Am I right?

21:09.790 --> 21:11.226
What, he told you
to lose weight?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.141
Just lay off, okay?

21:17.058 --> 21:18.842
I'm gonna have a nurse
put an IV in.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.907
Give you some fluids and bring
you a glass of orange juice.

21:20.931 --> 21:23.412
Fine, but can I leave
after that, please?

21:23.456 --> 21:24.674
Yeah, that should do it.

21:24.718 --> 21:27.155
I'll send the nurse in now.

21:36.077 --> 21:38.514
My sister needs protection
from that monster.

21:38.558 --> 21:41.343
I want you to report what you
saw today to the police and...

21:41.387 --> 21:42.866
Maggie, I can't do that.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.215
Excuse me?

21:44.259 --> 21:46.019
Look, I want to see
that prick behind bars, too.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.481
But what if she's not ready
to leave him?

21:50.657 --> 21:54.182
Which I don't think she is.

21:54.225 --> 21:57.141
I think Denise will be better
off if we convince her

21:57.185 --> 21:59.100
to report it herself
and walk away.

21:59.143 --> 22:02.103
My sister won't do that!

22:02.146 --> 22:04.714
I got an idea.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.369
Grab your coat
and meet me out front.

22:11.939 --> 22:15.812
Daniel, do you believe
Mrs. Parker lacked the capacity

22:15.856 --> 22:17.205
to refuse brain surgery?

22:17.248 --> 22:18.946
I never got a chance
to evaluate her.

22:18.989 --> 22:21.688
But a tumor in that area
certainly has the potential

22:21.731 --> 22:24.038
to affect reasoning,
understanding...

22:24.081 --> 22:26.562
Desi has been consistent
in her refusal of treatment

22:26.606 --> 22:27.998
since her initial diagnosis.

22:28.042 --> 22:30.349
She also agreed to consider
additional treatment

22:30.392 --> 22:31.654
if the disease progressed.

22:31.698 --> 22:34.135
Well, is there any
written record explicitly

22:34.178 --> 22:36.616
stating her wishes?
Just the advanced directive.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.835
Which clearly
establishes her husband

22:38.879 --> 22:40.315
as her surrogate decision maker.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.838
This isn't right.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.512
Her husband is taking advantage
of the situation.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.862
But doesn't the fact that she
granted him power of attorney

22:45.886 --> 22:48.018
in the first place demonstrate
a bond of trust?

22:48.062 --> 22:50.412
A bond that he is breaking
by completely disregarding

22:50.456 --> 22:51.935
her wishes.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.981
If we operate and anything
happens to the fetus...

22:54.024 --> 22:58.855
I'm sorry, Dr. Manning, but
the advanced directive stands.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.386
Will you guys excuse me
really quick?

23:07.429 --> 23:10.040
I will be right back, sorry.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.216
Maggie! Hey, beautiful.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.305
What do I owe the pleasure?
Don't you touch me.

23:14.349 --> 23:16.873
Come near my sister again,
respond to a text,

23:16.917 --> 23:20.224
answer a phone call,
and I will call the cops.

23:20.268 --> 23:21.922
I don't know what she told you,

23:21.965 --> 23:23.793
but you know your sister.
She's a drama queen.

23:23.837 --> 23:24.881
Don't you try me.

23:30.104 --> 23:31.627
That's what you
came down here for?

23:31.671 --> 23:34.108
Warn me to stay away?
That's right.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.370
What's it gonna be?

23:38.678 --> 23:40.897
Could have saved
yourselves a trip.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.117
I was done with
that freak anyways.

23:45.249 --> 23:48.383
You better back up...

23:48.427 --> 23:50.603
Go ahead.

23:50.646 --> 23:51.734
Take your shot.

24:16.890 --> 24:19.022
- Connor!
- Hi, Carlotta.

24:19.066 --> 24:20.850
Hi. Come inside.

24:20.894 --> 24:23.636
Thank you.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.291
Is this what you're looking for?

24:28.162 --> 24:30.077
Yeah, that's it. Thank you.

24:43.351 --> 24:46.485
Um, Carlotta,

24:46.528 --> 24:48.878
are there any other albums

24:48.922 --> 24:50.401
between '88 and '94?

24:50.445 --> 24:54.275
Don't see any. Why?

24:54.318 --> 24:57.800
Well, there's hardly
any pictures of my mom.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.715
Your poor mother.

24:59.759 --> 25:03.676
So much of the time
she wasn't feeling herself.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.955
Hey, baby. Call me back.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.174
- I didn't mean to...
- Denise.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.285
If you're here to lecture me,
you can save your breath.

25:28.309 --> 25:29.789
I already signed
my discharge papers.

25:29.832 --> 25:32.008
- Trevor's not gonna pick up.
- How do you know?

25:32.052 --> 25:33.706
- I went to talk to him.
- You what?

25:33.749 --> 25:35.011
You won't be hearing from him.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.013
No, no. Trevor wouldn't...

25:37.057 --> 25:38.425
He wouldn't run scared.
You're lying.

25:38.449 --> 25:39.886
I told him I knew
about his abuse.

25:39.929 --> 25:42.584
And I was never gonna
let him hurt you again.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.107
- You had no right.
- Denise...

25:44.151 --> 25:46.849
- What did he say?
- He said...

25:50.505 --> 25:52.289
He said you meant a lot to him.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.599
He was really upset.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.470
Devastated.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.037
But I gave him no choice.

26:01.081 --> 26:05.389
I told him that if he ever
spoke to you again,

26:05.433 --> 26:07.043
I was gonna call the cops.

26:09.306 --> 26:10.873
You stay out of my life, Maggie.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.745
Denise.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.626
- Cece.
- Hey.

26:24.670 --> 26:25.932
Hey.

26:25.975 --> 26:28.108
How did everything go with
your... your check up?

26:28.151 --> 26:29.152
Good. Good, good.

26:29.196 --> 26:30.806
Great. Listen.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.610
Are you doing anything tonight?
Do you have any plans?

26:32.634 --> 26:33.809
No.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.594
'Cause I am having dinner
with the head

26:35.637 --> 26:37.639
of the anthropology department
at U of C.

26:37.683 --> 26:38.945
Okay.

26:38.988 --> 26:40.487
There's a position
opening up next semester.

26:40.511 --> 26:42.035
So what's that got
to do with me?

26:42.078 --> 26:43.534
Well, I just thought you'd...
You'd like to join us

26:43.558 --> 26:45.299
because the position
sounds great.

26:45.342 --> 26:48.519
I mean, two classes a semester,
sabbatical every three years,

26:48.563 --> 26:49.801
you could... you
could write your book.

26:49.825 --> 26:52.785
I already have a position
at Hamline.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.023
I know, but... but
this way you could...

26:54.047 --> 26:55.396
You could stay in Chicago.

26:55.439 --> 26:56.678
You could keep working
with Dr. Singh.

26:56.702 --> 27:00.227
Maybe I don't want
to stay in Chicago.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.316
Have you ever thought of that?

27:02.359 --> 27:05.798
Damn, Danny, sometimes
you don't know when to quit.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.243
Can you heat up his bottle?

27:16.286 --> 27:17.853
It's on the top shelf
in the fridge.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.289
You got it.

27:26.601 --> 27:28.951
Ethan? Come here.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.390
All of Emily's clothes are gone.

27:33.434 --> 27:35.654
So is her suitcase.

27:46.969 --> 27:49.711
Dr. Charles?

27:49.755 --> 27:51.365
You know where Dr. Manning is?

27:52.453 --> 27:54.411
I think she's with
another patient.

27:54.455 --> 27:57.719
But, um, they should be coming
to prep Desi for surgery

27:57.763 --> 27:59.678
very soon.
No, no, it's not that.

28:01.592 --> 28:03.682
Without the operation,
Desi's never gonna wake up,

28:03.725 --> 28:05.988
is she?

28:06.032 --> 28:07.816
It's unlikely.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.862
So she'd lose the baby, right?

28:09.905 --> 28:11.820
Well, not necessarily.

28:11.864 --> 28:14.301
Plan would be to continue
to treat the swelling

28:14.344 --> 28:16.651
in her brain with steroids
which should allow her

28:16.695 --> 28:18.740
to remain on the ventilator
long enough to deliver

28:18.784 --> 28:23.440
via C-section once the fetus
becomes viable in a few weeks.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.705
You mean she'd become
one human incubator.

28:27.575 --> 28:29.292
You know, that's not
the term that I would use.

28:29.316 --> 28:30.665
But, um...

28:32.972 --> 28:35.496
I know what she
would want me to do.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.108
I just, uh...

28:41.807 --> 28:43.896
- You're terrified.
- Mmm.

28:50.772 --> 28:54.341
Desi and I were just kids
when we met.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.865
Freshman year of college.

28:59.476 --> 29:01.391
You know, we've really
grown up together.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.459
You know, we've seen each
other through everything

29:06.483 --> 29:10.313
and she knows me
better than anyone.

29:10.357 --> 29:12.185
Yeah.

29:12.228 --> 29:14.535
And you know her
better than anyone.

29:14.578 --> 29:18.060
Which is why she trusted you
to become her voice

29:18.104 --> 29:22.195
when she was no longer able
to speak for herself.

29:22.238 --> 29:23.718
And, Caleb, look.

29:23.762 --> 29:27.374
Letting go of someone that
you love when every instinct

29:27.417 --> 29:30.812
is telling you to hold on,
to fight,

29:30.856 --> 29:35.556
I mean, it's the hardest
thing in the world.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.993
But Desi knew that you
were up to the task.

29:39.560 --> 29:43.346
Now you just have to come
to believe that you are, too.

30:09.068 --> 30:10.330
Mags?

30:13.246 --> 30:14.377
Are you okay?

30:20.557 --> 30:21.863
Me and Denise...

30:24.257 --> 30:26.172
We'd just gotten close again.

30:28.087 --> 30:29.523
And now...

30:33.266 --> 30:35.572
I probably lost her for good.

30:53.112 --> 30:55.070
Clear!

30:56.637 --> 30:57.856
- Dad?
- Epi.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.181
Charge again to 200.
What happened?

30:59.205 --> 31:00.728
We don't know.

31:00.771 --> 31:01.729
He flipped into V-fib.
Might have had an MI.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.078
Charging. Charged.

31:03.122 --> 31:06.255
Clear.

31:06.299 --> 31:07.561
Epi, charge to 200.

31:07.604 --> 31:10.303
I'm taking over.

31:10.346 --> 31:11.913
Charged. Clear.

31:16.178 --> 31:19.442
- Asystole.
- Epi.

31:19.486 --> 31:22.010
Meds are in.

31:22.054 --> 31:25.492
Come on!

31:25.535 --> 31:28.495
Come on, Dad! Come on!

31:28.538 --> 31:29.931
Come on!

31:29.975 --> 31:31.474
Connor, he'd already been
down ten minutes

31:31.498 --> 31:35.241
by the time you got here.

31:35.284 --> 31:36.503
Connor.

31:36.546 --> 31:39.462
No!

31:42.248 --> 31:45.642
Time of death, 17:42.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.446
Hi.

32:06.489 --> 32:07.838
We'll be moving Desi
up to pre-op

32:07.882 --> 32:09.425
and Dr. Abrams will be waiting
for us up there.

32:09.449 --> 32:12.234
- No.
- I'm sorry?

32:12.278 --> 32:13.757
No surgery.

32:15.368 --> 32:16.760
Can you give us a moment?

32:19.459 --> 32:21.200
Caleb, are you sure?

32:21.243 --> 32:22.375
Yeah.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.555
The cancer took everything
away from Desi.

32:30.252 --> 32:33.125
But this is the one thing
she was determined

32:33.168 --> 32:35.127
not to let it touch.

32:39.305 --> 32:40.828
She's been so brave.

32:42.699 --> 32:46.312
For me, for Elijah.

32:46.355 --> 32:51.056
The least I can do is try to
have an ounce of her courage.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.991
Em, it's me again. Call me back.

33:13.034 --> 33:17.430
Took a lot of rocking
but Vincent's finally asleep.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.258
- She still not picking up?
- No.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.044
I'm gonna talk
to Bernie tomorrow

33:23.088 --> 33:25.177
and let him know Emily's gone.

33:25.220 --> 33:28.832
And after tonight,
I'll keep Vincent at my place

33:28.876 --> 33:32.010
till... till Bernie's released.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.968
The baby can stay here.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.622
- April, no.
- What?

33:35.665 --> 33:37.537
I already know his routine. Hey.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.973
His stuff is here.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.975
Vincent's not
your responsibility.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.760
It's no problem. Really.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.243
Listen.

33:48.287 --> 33:50.985
I'm not sure how long
this is gonna last.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.639
Even after Bernie's out
of the hospital,

33:52.682 --> 33:56.425
the guy...
Guy doesn't have a job.

33:56.469 --> 33:59.167
If Emily doesn't come back,

33:59.211 --> 34:02.431
Vincent may be with me
for the foreseeable future.

34:04.346 --> 34:05.956
With us.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.654
I'm not gonna let you
do this alone.

34:07.697 --> 34:09.308
- April...
- What?

34:13.355 --> 34:18.317
Anyone else would have bailed
on this whole mess

34:18.360 --> 34:20.797
a long time ago.

34:20.841 --> 34:21.841
But you're still here.

34:23.844 --> 34:25.324
Because it's you, Ethan.

34:50.175 --> 34:55.527
I was coming to tell my dad
that he was right.

34:55.571 --> 34:58.357
And that my mother wasn't
at my seventh birthday party.

34:58.400 --> 35:03.623
In fact, she... she wasn't there
for most of my life.

35:06.234 --> 35:12.762
I turned her into
this doting, perfect mother.

35:12.806 --> 35:16.810
Turns out it was all fiction.

35:16.853 --> 35:19.769
All these years, I blamed
my dad for her death.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.991
I thought that it was
his cheating that drove her

35:24.034 --> 35:26.994
- to kill herself.
- Hey.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.213
Hey.

35:28.256 --> 35:30.693
You were just trying
to make sense of it.

35:39.702 --> 35:42.575
What else am I inventing?

35:59.896 --> 36:01.637
I'll go check on Vincent.

36:33.103 --> 36:36.281
Ethan, uh... whoa.
What's going on?

36:36.324 --> 36:38.805
- Where have you been?
- Look, I'm so sorry.

36:38.848 --> 36:41.460
I was feeling really overwhelmed

36:41.503 --> 36:42.809
and I kinda freaked out.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.245
You ditched your son.

36:44.289 --> 36:46.247
I know it was really
irresponsible for me

36:46.291 --> 36:48.031
to just take off,
but I only made it

36:48.075 --> 36:49.555
to St. Louis before
turning back.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.731
I couldn't leave Vincent.

36:51.774 --> 36:52.993
Hey, sweetie. It's Mama.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.560
Are you ready to go for a ride?

36:54.603 --> 36:58.259
Do you know what time it is?
Where are you going?

36:58.303 --> 37:00.174
Back to the hospital
to see Bernie.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.915
ICU's no place for a baby.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.656
- It's fine.
- No.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.484
Vincent's staying here.

37:05.527 --> 37:07.529
Excuse me?

37:07.573 --> 37:09.792
Give me my son.
You can't keep him from me.

37:09.836 --> 37:12.012
No, I'm not keeping
him from you.

37:12.055 --> 37:13.709
But Vincent needs consistency.

37:13.753 --> 37:16.669
Em, this is no kind
of life for Vincent, all right?

37:16.712 --> 37:18.497
You need to come up with a plan.

37:20.890 --> 37:24.285
All right, all right.

37:24.329 --> 37:27.375
I'll put him back to bed
and stay here tonight.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.682
If that's okay with you, April.

37:29.725 --> 37:31.379
Yeah, of course.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.555
And in the morning
I'll figure something out.

37:33.599 --> 37:36.819
With or without Bernie.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.081
I promise.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.911
Oh, honey.

37:58.754 --> 38:02.889
Hey. Hey.

38:02.932 --> 38:06.109
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:06.153 --> 38:08.721
I wasn't sure that you
were gonna show.

38:10.549 --> 38:11.941
So what's up?

38:11.985 --> 38:16.772
Um, so that's a really...
That's a good situation

38:16.816 --> 38:18.252
- at Hamline.
- Yeah.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.775
Y-yeah, yeah. Do that.

38:19.819 --> 38:23.257
Right?

38:23.301 --> 38:24.476
Yeah.

38:35.443 --> 38:38.098
What's this?

38:49.022 --> 38:51.024
You're resigning from Med.

38:51.067 --> 38:53.505
Caroline, these last few
months with you,

38:53.548 --> 38:55.376
I don't... I don't understand it.
It's crazy.

38:55.420 --> 38:58.118
It's felt... it's
felt like... like...

38:59.772 --> 39:03.950
Like coming home.
Uh, I wanna go with you.

39:03.993 --> 39:07.649
Oh, Danny.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.564
I want to marry you.

39:09.608 --> 39:10.957
Again.

39:15.614 --> 39:18.181
I lied.

39:18.225 --> 39:22.142
There was no... there was
no offer from Hamline.

39:22.185 --> 39:25.014
They didn't ask me to come back.

39:25.058 --> 39:26.755
- They didn't?
- No.

39:28.975 --> 39:32.805
I found out a couple days ago

39:32.848 --> 39:35.938
that my lymphoma is progressing

39:35.982 --> 39:37.984
and the clinical trial
isn't working

39:38.027 --> 39:40.682
and there's nothing more
they can do.

39:40.726 --> 39:42.597
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.294
I shouldn't have lied
about any of that.

39:44.338 --> 39:47.341
I just thought that it would be
better for everyone

39:47.385 --> 39:50.910
if I just left.
I want to be there.

39:50.953 --> 39:55.349
For all of it. All of it.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.699
You know,
in sickness and in health?

39:59.614 --> 40:00.876
If you'll have me.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.770
Please don't make me
get down on one knee.

40:05.794 --> 40:08.014
I don't think I'd ever be able
to get back up.
