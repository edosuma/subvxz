WEBVTT

00:06.307 --> 00:08.741
Ah, the end of the year.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.543
The weather changes,

00:11.545 --> 00:13.312
<i>Kids pair off,</i>

00:13.314 --> 00:15.280
First love.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.617
It amazes me
how the power of love

00:18.619 --> 00:20.486
Sometimes guides
the perfect couples

00:20.488 --> 00:22.521
Right into
each other's arms.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.194
And sometimes
it does that.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.832
But it's still first crush
and i love this time of year.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.602
( chuckles )
probably because
i don't have to worry

00:36.604 --> 00:39.438
Like those other poor sap,
seventh-grade fathers.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.240
( laughs )
wait a minute.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.543
<i>( soft music playing )</i>

00:52.286 --> 00:53.952
No-ooo!

00:59.460 --> 01:01.026
Dad, are you
out of your mind?

01:01.028 --> 01:04.396
Riley, it's time
for the talk.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.565
In front
of the whole class?!

01:08.803 --> 01:11.570
Yeah, give her the talk.
Let's see what you know.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.906
Okay.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.707
- When a daughter--
- stop.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.677
Excuse me.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.581
Not today, chachi.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.384
( grunts )

01:26.720 --> 01:28.620
Sir, you've known me
all year.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.255
You like me,
admit it.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.424
I don't wanna.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.294
I'm one of the good kids.
What are you so afraid of?

01:36.030 --> 01:37.296
Okay.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.001
No-ooo!

01:43.003 --> 01:44.636
( trails off )

01:45.906 --> 01:47.339
Okay, guys.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.575
It's seventh-grade
spring fever,

01:49.577 --> 01:52.711
Which leads to dating,
which leads to movies,

01:52.713 --> 01:56.281
Which leads to popcorn,
which leads to putting
your hands together

01:56.283 --> 01:57.916
In the dark
touching the popcorn,

01:57.918 --> 02:00.819
Which leads to holding hands,
which leads to that.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.992
Oh, i am not
ready for this.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.460
Come with me.
Come here.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.828
Come on, no,
come on.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.063
Come with me.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.333
Riley, i am begging you,

02:14.335 --> 02:16.034
Stay in neverland,
okay?

02:16.036 --> 02:17.202
No growing up.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.075
What do you want?

02:23.077 --> 02:25.878
The way i see it,
i'm in an interesting
position here.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.479
How do you figure,
farkle?

02:27.481 --> 02:29.815
Let's approach this
as a scientific equation.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.650
You're scared of lucas
going out with riley, right?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.952
( scoffs )
oh, does it show?

02:33.954 --> 02:35.921
Yeah, he's good-looking
and athletic.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.323
He's 36!

02:40.094 --> 02:41.693
Give your daughter to me.

02:41.695 --> 02:44.163
I'll give you four oxen
and my best milking cow.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.068
Are you actually
thinking about this?

02:50.070 --> 02:52.437
It's a good deal.

02:53.707 --> 02:54.873
I will decide

02:54.875 --> 02:56.441
Who i go on
my first date with

02:56.443 --> 02:59.344
At such time
as somebody asks me.

Why do you think
he put his hand back down?

04:03.877 --> 04:05.611
Because your dad
wouldn't call on him.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.612
( laughs )
and i don't think

04:06.614 --> 04:07.980
He ever will again.

04:07.982 --> 04:11.049
( sighs )
life used to be so simple, maya.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.118
Wake up, brush my hair,
eat cereal,

04:13.120 --> 04:15.988
Pick up the bowl of cereal
that i dropped.

04:15.990 --> 04:18.056
When did all
of this pressure happen?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.659
Boys have it easy,
they get to ask.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.727
Girls have it easy.

04:21.729 --> 04:24.029
Yeah, we gotta do
all the asking.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.131
All they have
to do is say no.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.600
Well, they could
say yes.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.936
They could do that?

04:30.938 --> 04:33.605
Oh yeah, they wouldn't
last a day in our shoes--

04:33.607 --> 04:35.907
Waiting for them to get
the courage to ask us?

04:35.909 --> 04:39.044
And then doing the vacuuming
and ironing the babies.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.113
Riley, this isn't
the '90s anymore.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.748
You want something,
you go get it.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.117
You're telling me you're not
a little bit afraid of this?

04:45.119 --> 04:48.086
- No.
- You're saying that
if you had feelings

04:48.088 --> 04:50.589
For somebody that you
wouldn't be nervous?

04:50.591 --> 04:52.791
No, the only thing
that makes me nervous

04:52.793 --> 04:54.877
Is that the thing
that everybody wants

04:54.878 --> 04:56.962
To happen never happens
because everybody's too afraid

04:56.964 --> 04:58.096
To make it happen.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.199
You know what i was
always afraid of?

05:01.201 --> 05:03.018
- What?
- You.

05:03.019 --> 05:04.836
- How come?
- I know we're
good friends and all,

05:04.838 --> 05:06.872
But i've always considered
you a bit of a threat.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.207
Just like i know you've
always considered me
a bit of a threat.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.843
Yeah, you keep me
up at night.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.112
But now i realize you're
actually the solution

05:14.114 --> 05:16.114
- To my riley-maya dilemma.
- How do you figure?

05:16.116 --> 05:17.783
I just never
asked one out

05:17.785 --> 05:19.117
Because i knew
it would break
the heart of the other.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.652
What if i ask
one of 'em out?

05:20.654 --> 05:22.087
Bye-bye, i get
the other one.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.022
What if i ask
the other one out?

05:24.024 --> 05:25.123
Hello, i get
the first one.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.092
How long you
wanna do this?

05:27.094 --> 05:28.660
Well, there's
only two of them.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.195
So you're gonna ask
one of them out?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.031
Maybe i will...

05:33.033 --> 05:33.965
Someday.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.534
Hey, ranger rick.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.685
Hey, other one.

05:36.686 --> 05:37.835
- You wanna go out with me?
- What?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.237
You wanna take me
to a movie

05:39.239 --> 05:41.073
And put our hands
in the popcorn
at the same time

05:41.075 --> 05:42.741
And see what happens,
or what?

05:44.778 --> 05:46.745
Okay, you and me
'cause i don't care.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.814
( gasps )

05:59.126 --> 06:00.792
- ( hisses )
- yeow!

06:00.794 --> 06:02.027
Back, traitor.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.729
Traitor, me?

06:03.731 --> 06:05.530
Could this possibly be
because i asked lucas out?

06:05.532 --> 06:06.631
You asked lucas out.

06:06.633 --> 06:07.799
What?  You're upset?

06:07.801 --> 06:08.934
I'm beyond upset.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.303
I'm whatever
the next one is.

06:11.305 --> 06:13.071
What, you think
he's cute?

06:13.073 --> 06:14.806
He's a'ight.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.242
What, you wanted him
to ask you out?

06:17.244 --> 06:21.113
Maybe, but now you ruined
my eight-year plan.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.014
Riles, you've been all goofy
about lucas

06:23.016 --> 06:24.616
Since you fell into his lap
on the subway.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.818
- You pushed me.
- And now i pushed him.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.120
What do you mean?

06:28.122 --> 06:29.154
Don't worry about it.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.555
I am worried.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.857
I am worried
about our friendship

06:31.859 --> 06:33.992
Which you have called
into question on this day.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.827
Oh, all right, you want
to ask each other questions?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.129
Go ahead.

06:37.131 --> 06:38.864
- Why did you ask him?
- How long do you know me?

06:38.866 --> 06:40.766
- Where are you taking him?
- You think i would hurt you?

06:40.768 --> 06:43.268
- What are you gonna wear?
- You don't think i have
a bigger plan?

06:43.270 --> 06:45.971
Can i at least be
your maid of honor?

06:47.074 --> 06:49.808
Of course, when i marry
anybody else in the world

06:49.810 --> 06:51.676
- Besides ranger rick.
- ( scoffs ) what?

06:51.678 --> 06:54.146
You're just going
to date him and then
throw him away?

06:54.148 --> 06:55.580
- Hey, whack job?
- Yes.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.982
He doesn't wanna
go out with me.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.751
He's not going out with me.
He's never going out with me.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.187
Well, if he doesn't want
to go out with you,

07:02.189 --> 07:04.890
Do you not want me
to go out with him?

07:04.892 --> 07:06.591
( sighs )
come here.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.763
Life is changing,
isn't it?

07:11.765 --> 07:12.864
Yes.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.866
But this never will.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.301
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

07:16.303 --> 07:18.603
Who's that?
I wasn't
expecting anybody.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.172
Oh, i was.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.143
You.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.179
( mimics )
me.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.015
Auggie's not home.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.651
Yeah, i'm not here
to see auggie.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.020
Riley's not home either.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.388
Hi, lucas.

07:38.025 --> 07:41.159
That's right, i lied
right in yo' face.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.929
Actually, mr. Matthews,
i'm not here to see her either.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.163
You're not?

07:45.165 --> 07:46.164
You're not?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.866
I want to do this
the right way.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.035
So first, i'm here
to talk to you, sir.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.303
( chuckles )

07:57.711 --> 07:59.911
I want to do this
the right way too, lucas.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.080
No!

08:10.991 --> 08:12.991
Mr. Matthews,
would it be possible

08:12.993 --> 08:14.426
To speak to you alone?

08:14.428 --> 08:16.928
- About homework?
- No.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.296
- About a grade?
- No.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.031
Then this has
nothing to do with me

08:20.033 --> 08:21.933
And you've come
to the wrong place.
Good day.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.102
- Actually--
- i said good day, sir.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.204
But i need
to talk to you.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.139
Is this about
a historical event?

08:28.141 --> 08:30.342
I can only speak to you
about historical events.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.777
- Yes.
- Well, then go right ahead.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.813
I'm asking you permission
to ask out your daughter.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.149
You tricked me.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.118
That's right, i lied
right in yo' face.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.686
Get him, topanga.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.889
My pleasure.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.090
Lucas...

08:45.092 --> 08:46.358
You are about
the most charming

08:46.360 --> 08:47.893
Young man
i have ever met.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.195
Yeah!

08:51.932 --> 08:54.299
But as delighted as i am
that in this day and age

08:54.301 --> 08:56.067
You would come to get
our blessing,

08:56.069 --> 08:58.737
- Do you really think
that riley is ready--
- yes!

08:58.739 --> 09:01.406
( scoffs )
riley, be cool.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.844
Yes.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.279
Topanga, we really
need to talk.

09:07.281 --> 09:09.080
Mr. Matthews,
we really need
to talk.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.016
Good, help me.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.118
When a father turns
a certain age,

09:13.120 --> 09:14.886
Things will start
happening to you

09:14.888 --> 09:17.055
That you don't understand.
It'll confuse you,

09:17.057 --> 09:18.156
But it's a magical time.

09:18.158 --> 09:21.026
Shut up.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.061
Look, don't worry.
This is all normal

09:23.063 --> 09:26.231
And it's just your body's
way of telling you
that you are a woman.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.099
Look, if it makes
you feel any better,

09:28.101 --> 09:29.401
Don't think of it
as a date.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.836
Think of it as
a beautiful fantasy world

09:31.838 --> 09:33.939
That only
includes the two of them
and not you anymore.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.174
I appreciate you, maya.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.742
I think you're
pretty fierce.

09:38.512 --> 09:39.778
Hey, kiddies.

09:39.780 --> 09:40.912
Uncle boing.

09:40.914 --> 09:41.913
Whoo.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.181
- My brother!
- My brother!

09:43.183 --> 09:45.050
- Hey, i come with news.
- Thank you, i'm good.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.985
I'm joining the n.Y.U.
Pre-college program

09:46.987 --> 09:48.219
So i'll be here
all summer.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.989
- Okay, i'm no good.
- I gotcha, honey.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.090
Josh, would you
do me a favor

09:52.092 --> 09:53.325
And explain
to your niece

09:53.327 --> 09:55.060
That she is
way too young

09:55.062 --> 09:57.395
To go out
on her first date?

09:57.397 --> 09:59.264
Niece...

09:59.266 --> 10:02.834
What kept you so long?
Welcome to the party, guys.
Enjoy.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.170
- Get out of my house!
- I'll go the party
with you, josh.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.805
Still too old
for you, maya.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.340
Three years,
what's three years

10:08.342 --> 10:09.874
In the history
of love?

10:09.876 --> 10:11.493
They found some
cavemen footprints,

10:11.494 --> 10:13.111
A man and a woman,
they didn't know
how old they were.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.312
All the scientists
could tell was that

10:14.314 --> 10:15.981
They were holding hands.
You know why?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.515
That was all
that was important.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.251
- Wow, maya.
- Keep looking at me.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.120
Ooh, you know
what's really important

10:22.122 --> 10:23.822
Is i have my first
appointment

10:23.824 --> 10:24.923
With my campus advisor
downstairs.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.964
So i have everybody's
permission except mr. Matthews?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.799
Lucas, i like you.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.167
I really do.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.902
But do i look
like the kind of guy

10:37.904 --> 10:40.538
That would let his child
go out on a date this young?

10:43.910 --> 10:45.377
I put a ring
on it.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.347
What?

10:49.349 --> 10:51.583
We're engaged.

10:51.585 --> 10:54.886
Oooh, let us tell you
why you're not engaged.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.489
Let me tell you
why we are.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.057
Sing it, baby.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.892
♪ look at me ♪

11:00.894 --> 11:05.563
♪ i'm ava morgenstern... ♪

11:05.565 --> 11:07.332
♪ matthews. ♪

11:07.334 --> 11:09.000
( chuckles )
what?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.468
Oh my gosh.
Look at this ring.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.070
It looks just like mi--

11:12.072 --> 11:14.205
Hey!
Give me this.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.941
Yeah, it's auggie's
grandma's ring.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.244
( scoffs )
it's actually my ring.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.547
Oh, you're not
auggie's grandma?

11:22.549 --> 11:25.083
Ava honey,
are you looking at me?

11:25.085 --> 11:26.851
You looking at me
right in my eyes?

11:26.853 --> 11:28.186
Okay good, i got
something to say,

11:28.188 --> 11:30.155
- Ugh!
- Ava: Eww!

11:32.359 --> 11:34.225
Greetings, matthews,
i've come to ask riley out

11:34.227 --> 11:36.227
On her first date
now that maya has
asked out lucas.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.495
What?

11:37.497 --> 11:38.530
Why would you
do that?

11:38.532 --> 11:40.065
Because nobody
does nothin'.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.133
You lit
the fire, huh?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.568
Somebody had to push
these two kids together.

11:43.570 --> 11:46.271
Have i told you lately
i think you're pretty fierce?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.373
Have i told you lately i think
you're pretty fierce?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.475
- ( chuckles )
- what's going on?

11:50.477 --> 11:52.010
What's going on,
farkle,

11:52.012 --> 11:55.046
Is that this kid here
wants my blessing.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.614
You want it?

11:56.616 --> 11:57.615
I do, sir.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.150
You got it.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.985
- Really?
- Really?

12:00.987 --> 12:02.353
- Really?
- Really?

12:02.355 --> 12:04.556
Because i got a cow
in the elevator.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.629
- On one condition.
- Uh-oh.

12:11.631 --> 12:15.266
I want this
to be a double date.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.468
Okay?

12:16.470 --> 12:18.203
If you are gonna
go out with him,

12:18.205 --> 12:20.171
Then you...

12:20.173 --> 12:22.207
Are gonna go out
with him.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.610
That works for me because
you're riley or maya.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.546
Dad, you can't
just tell her

12:28.548 --> 12:30.348
Who to go out with
on her first date.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.484
Oh, don't think
of it as a date, maya.

12:32.486 --> 12:34.185
Think of this
as a magical time

12:34.187 --> 12:35.620
And a journey
to include--

12:35.622 --> 12:37.322
( blows raspberry )

12:37.324 --> 12:39.324
( sighs )

12:39.326 --> 12:41.126
- So--
- yes.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.193
- Riley--
- yes.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.695
- Maya...
- I'll fix it.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.330
Would you like
to go out with me?

12:45.332 --> 12:48.366
Y...Ay!

12:50.270 --> 12:51.503
I can't
fix that.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.139
- So, maya--
- no.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.039
- Would you--
- no.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.107
I mean it, maya.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.078
Would you whatever
he's doing with her?

13:05.051 --> 13:06.384
Yeah, fine.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.061
So what
is your primary reason
for choosing n.Y.U.?

13:17.063 --> 13:18.696
Academics, location,
or other?

13:18.698 --> 13:21.065
Uh, well, it was
academics.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.102
But now it's other.

13:26.339 --> 13:30.041
I can't believe you'd let
farkle be your first date
so lucas can be mine.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.043
Riles, i'm not gonna look
at it as a first date.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.244
We hang out with farkle
all the time.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.146
This is just...
More hanging out.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.648
But farkle thinks
it's a date.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.184
Then this is just more
farkle thinking it's a date.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.453
But does that mean
that my date with lucas

13:42.455 --> 13:43.655
Isn't actually a date?

13:43.657 --> 13:46.090
No no, your date
with lucas is serious

13:46.092 --> 13:48.326
Right-of-passage,
coming-of-age,
growing-up stuff.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.195
Should i be scared?
( chuckles )

13:50.197 --> 13:52.063
Of ranger rick?

13:52.065 --> 13:54.232
Sure, honey, you be
as scared as you like.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.204
Well, i don't think
you need to be anywhere
near that scared.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.105
- We have to go.
- Why?

14:01.107 --> 14:03.107
Maya, please.
Do you trust me?

14:03.109 --> 14:04.275
More than anyone
in the world.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.410
Then don't turn around.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.512
Okay, if you say
not to, i won't.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.314
Let's go.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.316
Oh, wait, i forgot.
I'm still me.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.056
You know what
the best thing is about
going out with farkle?

14:18.058 --> 14:19.557
What?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.392
No matter what happens

14:21.394 --> 14:23.294
I won't get hurt.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.138
How do i look, mom?

14:34.140 --> 14:37.442
( sighs )
like your father won't let
you out of the house.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.077
Good.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.080
Do you remember
your first date with dad?

14:42.082 --> 14:43.448
Oh...

14:43.450 --> 14:45.083
We were two years old

14:45.085 --> 14:46.651
And we played
in the playground.

14:46.653 --> 14:50.121
No, we were eight
and we caught fireflies.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.156
No, we were
in sixth grade

14:52.158 --> 14:54.459
And we kissed
against the lockers.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.829
No, we threw socks
into a laundry basket.

14:57.831 --> 15:01.266
No, he fell into
a llama pen at the zoo.

15:01.268 --> 15:05.503
No, that was his first
date with shawn.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.306
Well, i am really excited
for my first date.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.208
Oh, what girl
wouldn't be.

15:10.210 --> 15:13.244
All right, let's get
this thing over with.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.313
- Ay chihuahua.
- What?

15:15.315 --> 15:17.215
For someone
who does not care

15:17.217 --> 15:19.083
You do look
pretty ay chihuahua.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.319
Yeah, i just figured
even though i'm not

15:21.321 --> 15:22.654
Counting this as
a first date

15:22.656 --> 15:24.455
It seems like it's
a pretty big deal for farkle

15:24.457 --> 15:27.258
So i wanted to give him
at least 84%.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.494
Good.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.496
So you're feeling better
about my uncle josh?

15:31.498 --> 15:33.298
No, that's just
another lump of coal

15:33.300 --> 15:35.199
I'll bury deep
in my dungeon of sadness

15:35.201 --> 15:37.468
Next to my daddy issues
and ballerina dreams.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.505
Maya, i didn't know that you
dream of being a ballerina.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.641
I don't.
I dream of ballerinas kicking me
with their pointy toes

15:43.643 --> 15:46.544
While they're
stabbing me in the face
with their bun heads.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.713
Oh.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.114
Well, you look great.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.285
Okay, guys.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.254
I know that you
love each other

15:56.256 --> 15:59.190
And that you probably
wanna get married.

15:59.192 --> 16:03.294
But i wonder if you understand
the actual responsibilities

16:03.296 --> 16:04.796
That go along
with being a couple.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.598
It means we push
only each other
on the swings.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.234
And never share a cubby
with anybody else.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.604
Even if
i'm home sick.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.344
It was one time.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.746
How long are you gonna
hold this over my head?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.748
I don't want you
sharing a cubby

16:23.750 --> 16:24.916
With emma weathersbee.

16:24.918 --> 16:28.353
Her rain boots
mean nothing to me.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.589
Now you see, guys,

16:31.591 --> 16:32.890
This right here...

16:32.892 --> 16:36.594
This is why you probably
may not be ready to--

16:36.596 --> 16:38.396
But it made me
feel bad.

16:38.398 --> 16:42.200
It hurts my heart
that it made you feel bad.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.803
Do you,
auggie doggie matthews,

16:45.805 --> 16:48.239
Promise for the rest
of our lives

16:48.241 --> 16:50.475
To never make me
feel bad again?

16:50.477 --> 16:51.809
I do.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.611
Hold on.

16:53.613 --> 16:54.746
And do you,

16:54.748 --> 16:57.448
Ava melanie ruth
esther morgenstern,

16:57.450 --> 17:00.718
Promise to care about me
and never make me
feel bad either?

17:00.720 --> 17:03.421
I do.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.922
No, you don't.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.658
What was that?

17:08.862 --> 17:11.829
Honey, the girls just got ready
for their first date.

17:11.831 --> 17:15.233
You missed a real milestone
in our child's life.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.634
Oh yeah?

17:18.505 --> 17:20.571
Let me be the first
to introduce you

17:20.573 --> 17:23.441
To mr. And mrs.
Auggie doggie matthews.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.812
Oh... That's just--
it's great.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.781
Well, then let me
be the first

17:29.783 --> 17:32.250
To carry the bride
over the threshold.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.420
- Whee!
- Whee!

17:36.923 --> 17:38.256
But--

17:39.859 --> 17:41.225
Hey, that's my wife.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.460
Go to bed!

17:42.462 --> 17:43.761
Okay.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.868
What if i get nervous
and i have nothing to say?

17:50.870 --> 17:53.271
Farkle, riley and maya
are our friends.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.639
We've been together
all year

17:54.640 --> 17:56.006
And you haven't run out
of things to say yet.

17:56.009 --> 17:58.409
And if you do,
i'll be right here to--

17:58.411 --> 18:00.244
What's the matter?

18:02.749 --> 18:03.981
Oh my gosh,
look at maya.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.950
She's giving me
like 84%.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.753
I expected a cat t-shirt
and sweatpants,
but look at her.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.455
Hey maya, let's run
towards each other
in slow motion.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.290
- Maya!
- No.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.758
Come on,
you know you want to.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.693
Farkle, who else
would-- stop.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.164
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.932
I thought i was going to be
too nervous to say anything,
but i'm not.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.533
I'm talking really good.
I'm a good day-talker.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.634
I'm the best day-talker
there is.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.004
Even though
this just happened,

18:27.006 --> 18:30.508
There are some moments
you know you're gonna
remember forever.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.809
This is one of 'em.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.912
I'm the second-best
day-talker there is.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.848
Oh, train's coming.
All aboard.

18:36.850 --> 18:38.416
( mimics horn )

18:39.853 --> 18:42.053
Well, this concludes
our tour of the n.Y.U. Area.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.921
I hope you'll enjoy
the summer program.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.290
Yeah, and i hope we can
enjoy some of it together.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.726
( chuckles )
well, i'm sure
i'll see you around.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.329
Wait a minute,
um, i thought--

18:51.331 --> 18:53.764
- What?
- I thought
we were kinda--

18:53.766 --> 18:54.932
What?

18:54.934 --> 18:56.417
Getting along.

18:56.418 --> 18:57.901
I mean, weren't you smiling
a lot at me and stuff?

18:57.904 --> 19:00.004
I'm a tour guide,
josh.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.140
It's my job to be nice
to high school kids.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.947
Well, this is
pretty easy so far.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.550
Because we're
already friends.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.819
Let's always be friends
no matter what happens, okay?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.020
Yeah, first let's
see what happens.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.455
Okay.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.658
I don't wanna jinx this
but it's just like us

19:20.660 --> 19:21.726
Hanging out at school.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.494
What could possibly
go wrong?

19:29.469 --> 19:31.002
Sophie, sophie,
um...

19:31.004 --> 19:32.904
I thought we connected
pretty well.

19:32.906 --> 19:35.006
I'm gonna be
a junior, junior.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.908
I got a couple
years on you, don't i?

19:36.910 --> 19:39.477
What's three years?
You think three years
matters at our age?

19:39.479 --> 19:41.646
Yeah, i do.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.656
Maya?

19:51.658 --> 19:53.991
She pulled that
three-years-older thing
on you, huh?

19:53.993 --> 19:55.693
( chuckles )
yeah yeah.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.528
I really put
myself out there.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.665
Oh, i'm sure
i couldn't possibly
identify with your pain.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.868
Cavemen?
Footprints?

20:03.870 --> 20:05.436
Hold hands?

20:05.437 --> 20:07.003
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- A little bit, yeah.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.058
How do you
deal with it?

20:10.059 --> 20:12.043
Well, me, i've got
this dungeon of sadness.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.911
Oh yeah?
You got me in there?

20:13.913 --> 20:16.514
Oh yeah.
You and a whole flock
of ballerinas.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.384
Lucas?

20:23.423 --> 20:24.989
Go over there,
riley.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.424
Be with your
best friend.

20:28.161 --> 20:29.860
But what about
our date?

20:29.862 --> 20:32.096
I had a good time.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.733
I'm glad you were
my first date.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.413
What happened
to your date?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.748
We had a good time

20:50.750 --> 20:53.985
And then my best friend
got all needy.

20:53.987 --> 20:56.988
Yeah, i know
how that goes.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.923
Thanks for being
there for me.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.792
Hey, i'm sure you'll
make it up to me someday.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.729
( doors chime )

21:04.731 --> 21:06.030
How about now?

21:06.032 --> 21:07.932
Again?
( chuckles )

21:07.934 --> 21:09.667
Whoa!

21:11.004 --> 21:13.671
Hi, i'm riley.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.106
We were just
talking about you.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.441
( laughs )
i'm lucas.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.011
I love it.

21:20.013 --> 21:23.114
You know those moments
that you were talking about

21:23.116 --> 21:25.116
That we're going
to remember forever?

21:25.118 --> 21:26.651
Yeah?

21:41.100 --> 21:42.533
Not bad, farkle.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.568
Tell your friends.

21:57.116 --> 21:59.984
Our little girl went
on her first date.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.286
Our little boy
got married.

22:02.288 --> 22:04.188
I say we move
to florida.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.824
Nice!

22:06.826 --> 22:09.093
Mine was like
when it's summer

22:09.095 --> 22:10.528
And then the breeze
comes up

22:10.530 --> 22:13.097
And then it rains
for like two seconds

22:13.099 --> 22:15.866
And then everything glows
and there's a rainbow.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.134
How was yours?

22:17.136 --> 22:19.804
Mine was like a shih tzu
going after a chew toy.

22:21.074 --> 22:24.175
So it was a magical night
for the both of us.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.945
You realize, topanga,
that...

22:27.947 --> 22:30.114
Life as we know it
has changed.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.916
You realize, maya,
that...

22:31.918 --> 22:33.851
Life as we know it
has changed.

22:33.853 --> 22:34.885
Scared?

22:34.887 --> 22:35.953
Scared?

22:35.955 --> 22:38.155
Nah.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.757
I got you.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.627
No.

22:43.629 --> 22:44.829
I got you.
