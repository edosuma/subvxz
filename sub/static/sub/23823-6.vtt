WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:05.038
PARIS: I fled the field of battle.
I've brought shame on the whole city.

00:06.120 --> 00:07.713
HECTOR:
Alexander isn't coming back.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.590
What about the search parties?
<i>—</i> We've called them off.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.717
My husband isn't dead.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.590
Achilles and the Myrmidons
are refusing to fight.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.953
AENEAS:
That's 500 of their best men.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.709
HECTOR:
Then we have to move quickly.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.070
Enlist all men over 14 and under 40.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.916
ODYSSEUS: One hour.
Or you know what they'll do to her.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.038
AENEAS:
The horses, they're gone from the stables.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.952
What?
<i>—</i> Greeks! Attacking.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.713
Get the men out there. Now!

00:32.280 --> 00:33.634
To the wall! Move!

00:35.560 --> 00:37.437
XANTHIUS:
Lord Pandarus is a determined man.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.109
He will find out the truth

00:39.880 --> 00:41.109
unless you open that door.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.638
Aphrodite, why have you done this to me?

00:48.560 --> 00:49.595
I won't let you take him.

00:50.760 --> 00:51.830
APHRODITE WHISPERS:
No./

01:19.520 --> 01:23.434
WOMAN SPEAK SOFTLY
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE

01:48.920 --> 01:51.912
MEN MOAN IN PAIN

02:03.000 --> 02:04.195
HECTOR:
Are you alright, son?

02:12.640 --> 02:13.710
I saw you...

02:17.040 --> 02:18.030
As a boy.

02:19.720 --> 02:20.994
At the city games.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.269
You wrestled your brother.

02:26.880 --> 02:27.915
It was a good fight.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.950
Did I fight Well?

02:35.760 --> 02:37.558
What did you do
before you became a soldier?

02:39.600 --> 02:40.829
BIacksmith's apprentice.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.790
For your father?

02:45.840 --> 02:46.830
I am an orphan.

02:50.640 --> 02:51.675
No.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.753
No, you are a son of Troy.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.231
I am ready to give my life for her.

03:05.000 --> 03:05.990
What's your name?

03:08.800 --> 03:09.835
Astyanax.

03:38.560 --> 03:39.595
EVANDER:
What was it like?

03:41.080 --> 03:42.150
Did you fight near Hector?

03:44.800 --> 03:46.074
Did you kill any Greeks?

03:47.880 --> 03:49.473
I wish I could have been there with you.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.632
They slaughtered us.
<i>—</i> What?

03:55.240 --> 03:57.151
You are not a soldier, you're a boy.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.198
And you are not going out there.
<i>—</i> I will fight for my city if I want to.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.035
Like you.

04:03.680 --> 04:04.715
Like all men.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.070
The young were supposed
to be kept in reserve.

04:21.079 --> 04:22.115
I ordered it.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.634
The enemy out through our lines.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.756
There was no choice
but to send other reinforcements.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.713
The Greeks celebrate outside our walls.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.719
They can see victory on the horizon.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.513
SOLDIER SHOUTS OUT

04:52.120 --> 04:54.509
Pissing distance from the wall
and still we can't get in.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.594
Not without the Myrmidons, no.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.071
When this is over,
I want a thousand songs

05:00.160 --> 05:01.878
written about the craven Myrmidons.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.516
One thousand tales
of how they sat on their arses

05:05.600 --> 05:06.829
while we did the fighting.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.075
As long as you aren't expecting me
to sing any of them.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.271
She watched.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.952
I sent Paris running
like a scared child from my sword

05:20.560 --> 05:22.437
and still she stays behind a wall.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.230
Odysseus has been sent back
to speak to Achilles.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.160
Perhaps he can work his magic.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.994
PARIS BREATH ES SOFTLY

05:39.880 --> 05:43.191
A CREAKING SOUND

05:43.760 --> 05:45.273
WOMAN:
How come you're alive?

05:48.480 --> 05:49.595
Are you dangerous?

05:54.920 --> 05:55.910
So am I.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.830
A WOMAN SHOUTS OUT

06:50.160 --> 06:51.150
WOMAN:
Penthesilea.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.555
Our Amazon queen.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.994
How do you come to be in the river?

07:01.720 --> 07:03.154
PENTHESILEA:
What's your name?

07:06.600 --> 07:07.635
You're a soldier.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.877
But a long way from any battlefield.

07:22.760 --> 07:26.958
RAVEN CAWS

07:38.280 --> 07:39.634
You think it's barbaric.

07:43.760 --> 07:47.116
I had him searching for the man
who was betraying us.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.832
As it turned out, that man was him.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.034
Perhaps it is barbaric.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.396
But the war isn't just outside
these walls.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.990
It is in here.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.716
It is with us.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.790
It's in the streets, in the houses

08:10.160 --> 08:11.434
in the shadows of Troy.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.318
Let him be a lesson to us all.

08:17.920 --> 08:21.038
That treachery has a friendly face.

08:23.480 --> 08:24.675
And this is how it ends.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.590
Helen.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.596
You found me.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.198
I told you to get him out of the city.

09:20.640 --> 09:21.675
Not kill him.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.115
I tried.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.880
But he would not be persuaded.

09:29.920 --> 09:30.990
You're lying.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.274
He was going to take it to the king
with a letter of accusation.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.675
You know I can get you out.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.434
I wouldn't need long.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.119
A night's preparation, that's all.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.156
I didn't ask for that.
<i>—</i> You don't need to.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.351
INDISTINCT CHATTER

10:31.600 --> 10:32.590
WOMAN:
Draw.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.790
Loose.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.710
We found this.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.190
Do Troy's common soldiers
carry weapons like this?

10:55.480 --> 10:58.233
I am Alexander, son of Priam.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.189
Prince of Troy.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.472
My fate and that of the city
are entwined.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.794
So it was inability that led you to jump?
<i>—</i> There's a prophecy.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.591
There always is with boys like you.
<i>—</i> As long as I live, Troy is doomed.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.517
So if I killed you now,
I'd be doing Troy a service?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.115
I'm not afraid to die.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.195
Just not very good at it.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.439
So you say you come to fight for Troy?

11:25.400 --> 11:28.040
I come to fight for whoever wants
to kill Greeks.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.513
What did the Greeks do to you?

11:31.640 --> 11:32.755
Most of them, nothing.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.029
I'll kill them anyway.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.080
I'll kill any man that fights
under the banner of the Myrmidons.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.319
So you wish to kill Achilles?

11:45.480 --> 11:46.470
I wish to try.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.434
We ride for the city tomorrow.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.876
Come with us and fight for your people.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.589
If it makes you feel any better

11:57.680 --> 11:59.512
you'll almost certainly die
in the process.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.110
You miss it.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.636
I know you do.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.476
The adrenaline.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.713
The taste of metal on your tongue.

12:52.000 --> 12:52.990
The sound.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.630
The chaos.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.594
I miss the hush.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.552
When I meet an opponent worthy of me

13:07.920 --> 13:09.513
everyone around us stops to watch.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.710
The din of battle drains away
like a wave.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.270
For a few moments,
it's just the two of us.

13:22.920 --> 13:23.876
And then I kill him.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.956
And then everyone gets back
to what they were doing.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.879
ODYSSEUS:
Then come and do it.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.795
Come and fight.

13:44.880 --> 13:45.915
End this.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.755
My honour prevents it.

14:01.680 --> 14:02.670
PATROCLUS:
I tried.

14:13.960 --> 14:14.995
You should eat.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.509
You'll need your strength.

14:25.960 --> 14:26.916
We leave at sunrise.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.510
What will you do?

14:33.840 --> 14:35.672
If you're going to kill yourself,
just do it.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.318
Why does your queen hate Achilles?

14:43.080 --> 14:44.115
He killed her daughters.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.269
And sisters.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.470
Soldiers.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.829
There's a price to pay.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.271
A CUTTING SOUND
<i>—</i> He has not paid it yet.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.595
For luck.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.873
The Greeks camp outside our walls.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.195
My people are starving.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.270
My brother is gone.

15:26.600 --> 15:27.795
Your son is kicking me.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.518
I've known Pandarus since I was a boy.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.835
I would never have believed
he was capable of betraying us.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.236
No.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.790
Aphrodite.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.229
Allow me to find a way

16:11.000 --> 16:11.956
through the darkness

16:13.360 --> 16:14.873
to hold the walls of my city together.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.157
Let the children of Troy
play in the sun again.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.350
Let them taste bread.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.711
Let fathers grow old with their young ones

16:26.880 --> 16:27.711
with their wives...

16:31.720 --> 16:32.755
Their brothers.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.393
WIND WHISTLES SOFTLY

16:57.040 --> 16:58.269
WhY do you play with me?

17:00.760 --> 17:02.592
Why didn't you tell me about the prophecy?

17:04.079 --> 17:05.559
<i>APHRODYYE".
It was not mine to tell.</i>

17:08.200 --> 17:09.998
We sent our son away to die

17:11.680 --> 17:13.079
and then we let him back

17:14.760 --> 17:16.955
even though we knew
what damage it would do.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.555
<i>APHRODITE:
It's true.</i>

17:20.079 --> 17:22.992
<i>Troy will fall while Paris lives.</i>

17:24.000 --> 17:25.957
<i>But the curse has been broken</i>

17:26.000 --> 17:29.516
<i>and what was promised,
will not come to pass.</i>

17:31.800 --> 17:33.871
Your heart stopped
when you hit the water.

17:34.360 --> 17:35.998
I'm not dead.
<i>—</i> But you were.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.757
And the woman warriors brought you back.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.518
When you left the mortal realm
the prophecy was completed.

17:44.880 --> 17:45.950
Death took you

17:47.200 --> 17:48.998
and now you start afresh.

17:50.600 --> 17:51.874
A second chance.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.630
A chance for what?

17:58.960 --> 18:01.600
For fathers to grow old
with their children

18:03.040 --> 18:04.030
and their brothers.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.198
Do you remember choosing me?

18:13.440 --> 18:14.475
Yes.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.472
If we replayed that day
a thousand times again

18:19.880 --> 18:22.190
you'd choose me a thousand times more.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.675
Yes.

18:27.000 --> 18:27.990
Yes.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.630
WIND WHISTLES

18:34.480 --> 18:36.312

ANDROMACHE:
Hector.

18:52.840 --> 18:53.796
My brother's alive.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.590
I thought you were never coming back.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.515
Why?

20:32.240 --> 20:33.469
Why did you leave me?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.034
I was in disgrace.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.995
We would have fixed it.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.556
There was a prophecy.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.636
I don't care.

20:46.760 --> 20:49.195
I don't care about a stupid prophecy.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.713
Aphrodite visited me.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.552
She came and she told me

20:59.320 --> 21:00.833
that I had another chance.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.079
That I could come home...

21:05.640 --> 21:06.675
to you.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.550
HELEN:
I love you.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.195
I love you.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.553
You need to speak to them.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.310
I know.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.440
Have you ever been inside
the walls of Troy?

23:10.720 --> 23:11.710
Once.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.790
When I was a little girl.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.199
Was it a happy place?

23:29.440 --> 23:30.430
There was a market.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.515
Women selling jewellery.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.633
A man roasting birds on a spit.

23:42.200 --> 23:46.433
Children playing, merchants, musicians,
colours I'd never seen before.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.436
I want you to know that every memory
you have of that place

23:56.480 --> 23:59.279
every building you passed,
every person you saw

24:01.400 --> 24:02.720
I will burn it all down.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.749
I will put it to the sword,
I will wash it in blood.

24:07.760 --> 24:08.830
Can you picture that?

24:12.280 --> 24:13.236
ODYSSEUS:
Sir.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.120
You, come in. You, fuck off.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.035
Any news of Achilles?
<i>—</i> Still nothing.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.874
We can still take the city.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.634
We can do it quicker with him.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.232
You're in a hurry to get home, Odysseus?

24:43.920 --> 24:44.955
Yeah.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.150
Don't start rushing.
That's when mistakes get made.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.310
Come with me.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.555
It's about your brother.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.519
Could not live with what he had done.

25:27.600 --> 25:28.670
ODYSSEUS:
I'm sorry.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.070
HECUBA GASPS

26:10.920 --> 26:11.955
Mother.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.678
Aphrodite came to us.

26:28.600 --> 26:29.510
She came to me, too.

26:30.360 --> 26:31.998
She said the curse was broken.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.669
That you'd died and returned.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.551
It's true.

26:39.800 --> 26:40.835
My son.

26:42.880 --> 26:43.870
They killed Agelaus.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.150
I'm sorry.

26:48.560 --> 26:49.595
He was a good man.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.317
Let's get you some food and a bed.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.998
Mother...
<i>—</i> HECTOR: What's wrong?

26:55.040 --> 26:56.872
Can we speak with the generals together?

26:58.160 --> 26:59.833
PARIS:
We only need ten men at first.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.560
Acaicos?
<i>—</i> Dead.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.439
Eukleos?
<i>—</i> Dying.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.035
Kairos?

27:07.000 --> 27:08.229
No.
— OK.

27:08.720 --> 27:11.917
We have Deiphobus, Troilus, myself,
you and Aeneas.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.356
Aeneas, give us five more of your best
and most absolutely alive soldiers.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.636
Give them a sword and shield and have them
by the front gate immediately.

27:17.720 --> 27:18.835
Cousins, a bit of caution.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.957
I'm afraid caution
is of little use to us now.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.794
If you were still of a mind to listen

27:24.040 --> 27:27.635
then my advice is to hold fast
and come up with a less suicidal strategy.

27:29.720 --> 27:30.710
ANDROMACHE:
Ten of you?

27:30.960 --> 27:33.110
Reinforcements will join us
once we've started.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.198
Let's hope none of them run away
this time.

27:37.880 --> 27:38.870
You're sure about this?

27:45.600 --> 27:46.635
I fight for both of you.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.271
<i>PARS".
The Greeks have pushed up to the walls.</i>

28:06.760 --> 28:08.751
<i>Only Achilles is left at the beach</i>

28:09.160 --> 28:10.389
<i>and he's not fighting.</i>

28:15.840 --> 28:17.433
<i>We go behind their lines</i>

28:17.880 --> 28:19.200
<i>cut off their supplies</i>

28:19.760 --> 28:21.034
<i>destroy their stores.</i>

28:21.520 --> 28:22.430
<i>Everything.</i>

28:23.360 --> 28:25.078
<i>Do to them what they did to us.</i>

28:34.200 --> 28:35.235
My husband is back.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.235
Where is he now?

28:42.840 --> 28:43.989
On the battlefield.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.395
He fights for the city.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.670
Good for him.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.591
My position has been reaffirmed.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.075
The Greeks

28:56.600 --> 28:59.114
will be sent back to where they came from

28:59.800 --> 29:01.199
and you should go with them

29:01.880 --> 29:03.314
if you have half a mind.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.034
You know I can't leave without you.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.751
I'll have guards come here
and whip the flesh from your back

29:14.840 --> 29:16.911
if you presume to dictate terms to me.

29:18.720 --> 29:19.915
Your husband is back.

29:22.520 --> 29:25.956
But the clays of him putting
your wellbeing before the city's...

29:26.680 --> 29:27.670
are.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.593
Those Trojan jewels are a noose
around your neck...

29:34.040 --> 29:35.075
and they're tightening.

29:37.560 --> 29:38.675
Perhaps you didn't hear.

29:40.400 --> 29:41.390
The curse was lifted.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.350
Tide has turned.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.236
When the walls of Troy start to fall

29:49.280 --> 29:50.509
and the chaos takes over

29:52.480 --> 29:54.357
there'|| be very little I can do
to protect you.

29:58.640 --> 29:59.710
Let me help you.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.478
You need to get out of the city.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.470
Now.

30:17.800 --> 30:18.790
DEIPHOBUS:
Oh, hello!

30:18.880 --> 30:22.111
PARIS: Be respectful Deiphobus,
they can kill you with their bare hands.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.994
DEIPHOBUS: God, I'd like that.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.913
HECTOR:
Good evening, your majesty.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.113
PENTHESILEA:
Has Greek blood been spilled?

30:30.880 --> 30:31.790
No.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.551
It's not a good evening yet, is it?

31:05.800 --> 31:06.995
MAN:
They've got some nerve.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.310
This is madness.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.516
They won't attack first
without Achilles' say so.

31:21.600 --> 31:22.635
So don't kill any of them.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.917
RIDER 1: Ya! Ya!

33:12.080 --> 33:14.594
MAN SHOUTS:
Greeks! Here they come!

33:15.080 --> 33:16.832
Here they come!

33:23.600 --> 33:25.273
MAN:
The Greeks are pulling back to the beach!

33:25.360 --> 33:27.670
Come on! On the double! Lets go!

33:27.760 --> 33:31.037
SOLDIERS CRY OUT

33:34.600 --> 33:35.795
MAN:
Kill them all!

33:51.360 --> 33:53.431
ANDROMACHE:
Sounds almost peaceful, doesn't it?

33:56.920 --> 33:59.480
But out there it's screaming
and it's blood.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.069
And our husbands are there.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.670
Fighting for us.

34:08.239 --> 34:09.230
And the city.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.034
Willing to sacrifice everything.

34:14.360 --> 34:15.759
And we have to stand and watch.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.154
You don't strike me as the sort
to enjoy just being a spectator.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.038
I have no desire for battle.

35:08.680 --> 35:12.355
SOLDIERS SHOUT OUT

35:13.720 --> 35:15.677
We're in arrow's range,
we should fight.

35:17.920 --> 35:19.274
We're Myrmidons, are we not?

35:31.040 --> 35:32.678
The Trojans are burning our supplies.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.798
And with us so close to victory?

35:35.200 --> 35:36.349
How inconsiderate of them.

35:36.440 --> 35:39.592
If we run out of food,
we will starve with everyone else.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.830
Well, I'm sure Menelaus
has it under control.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.877
He doesn't have it under control.

35:43.960 --> 35:47.112
He doesn't have anything under control.
The time has come, Achilles.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.349
You've lost a prize

35:53.440 --> 35:55.875
and you've been sitting around
like sour milk ever since.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.239
You're no better than Agamemnon.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.519
He knows he's an arrogant bastard.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.955
He doesn't try to hide it behind
some lofty ideals.

36:05.840 --> 36:06.671
Are you done?

36:06.760 --> 36:08.319
I'm done sitting around waiting for you

36:08.400 --> 36:10.596
to remember that you have a pair of balls
and a sword.

36:10.920 --> 36:14.993
I would like to go home now
and I cannot until this war is finished.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.429
Then perhaps you should leave

36:16.520 --> 36:18.955
before I forget that I once
had affection for you.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.073
It's not affection.

36:23.440 --> 36:24.430
It's love.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.754
I'm not afraid of it.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.311
When my mother dipped me
in the river as a child

36:30.400 --> 36:31.720
she did so with a mother's love.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.270
She gripped me tightly.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.396
Even as she looked to make me invincible

36:41.040 --> 36:42.314
she feared she'd drown me.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.430
Love is weakness.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.270
It doesn't have to be.

36:55.000 --> 36:55.990
Fight with me.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.639
If not, then fight for me.

37:04.720 --> 37:08.793
ANDROMACHE SCREAMS IN PAIN

37:09.600 --> 37:12.114
SHE SOBS

37:29.960 --> 37:31.030

PARIS:
Achilles! He's here!

Stay close, Alexander!

38:33.680 --> 38:39.676

38:58.720 --> 39:03.112
CLASH OF LONE SWORDS

PATROCLUS SCREAMS

39:37.440 --> 39:38.669
No!

39:42.400 --> 39:45.233
ACHILLES SCREAMS

40:14.240 --> 40:15.992
You sent another man out in your armour.

40:50.560 --> 40:56.556
BABY CRIES

42:21.320 --> 42:23.072
Your son, my prince.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.315
We'll name him Astyanax.

45:16.520 --> 45:17.999
He's going to come for you, isn't he?

45:25.880 --> 45:26.915
Hector, you can beat him.

45:30.040 --> 45:31.075
Hector?

45:31.160 --> 45:32.434
BABY CRIES

45:48.040 --> 45:50.031
CASSANDRA:
Their army's gone back to the beach.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.035
Yes.

45:53.560 --> 45:55.836
I liked it when they were
outside the walls.

45:57.640 --> 45:58.835
I like being able to see them.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.000
I think the things that you can't see

46:02.080 --> 46:03.798
are much scarier
than things that you can.

46:09.320 --> 46:10.310
My husband...

46:11.440 --> 46:13.909
Tell me.
What do you see of Hector?

46:16.200 --> 46:17.349
Does Achilles come for him?

46:18.880 --> 46:19.915
I don't know.

46:21.440 --> 46:22.635
What do you see?

46:24.000 --> 46:25.149
I don't see anything.

46:26.840 --> 46:28.035
Just blackness.

46:28.760 --> 46:30.034
Then the curse has been lifted.

46:36.520 --> 46:39.194
We've burnt their supplies,
we have the Amazons on side.

46:39.280 --> 46:40.759
The time to strike is now.

46:40.920 --> 46:44.550
Our army is hungrier than theirs.
<i>—</i> Our army will always be hungry.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.791
But theirs will recover.

46:48.320 --> 46:49.310
And if you lose?

46:52.680 --> 46:53.875
Achilles.

48:05.320 --> 48:06.833
HE SCREAMS:
Hector!

48:19.160 --> 48:20.514
Hector!

48:32.720 --> 48:33.551
You'll never...

48:43.520 --> 48:44.555
ACHILLES:
Hector!

48:46.240 --> 48:47.833
Your people are watching!

48:52.720 --> 48:54.279
I have to fight him.
<i>—</i> No.

48:55.160 --> 48:55.991
He's right.

48:56.480 --> 48:57.993
The city is watching, I can't refuse.

48:58.400 --> 48:59.356
You must.

49:03.640 --> 49:04.789
HECTOR:
Bring me my armour.

49:16.560 --> 49:18.870
I saw your man die on the beach.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.594
He begged for mercy
like a raped servant girl.

49:26.360 --> 49:29.159
I've never seen a soldier die
with less dignity.

49:36.480 --> 49:38.312
SHE SHIVERS

49:41.520 --> 49:43.636
My queen will open your heart

49:44.120 --> 49:46.191
and drink your blood,
you son of a whore.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.029
Son of a goddess, actually.

49:57.880 --> 49:58.995
Hector!

50:00.800 --> 50:01.710
ANDROMACHE:
Please.

50:02.200 --> 50:03.599
Don't go out there. Not today.

50:04.760 --> 50:06.433
Don't fight that man.
<i>—</i> I have no choice.

50:06.680 --> 50:08.671
Stay here with me,
with our son.

50:11.080 --> 50:12.309
Please.
<i>—</i> I would choose

50:12.640 --> 50:14.916
a short life as your husband
over a long one alone.

50:16.240 --> 50:20.757
BABY CRIES

50:22.160 --> 50:23.150
I fight for you both.

50:30.240 --> 50:31.435
HECTOR:
Open the gates!

51:38.320 --> 51:41.153
BABY MEWLS

51:44.680 --> 51:47.115
MEWLING CONTINUES

53:19.520 --> 53:20.954
You do bleed like the rest of us.

53:32.760 --> 53:34.114
HECTOR SCREAMS

53:59.880 --> 54:01.279
BABY MEWLS

54:05.760 --> 54:06.750
On your knees.

54:11.280 --> 54:12.475
I'll die on my feet.

54:22.520 --> 54:23.476
HECTOR SCREAMS

54:26.040 --> 54:27.633
You will die on your knees.

54:47.800 --> 54:51.634
ANDROMACHE SOBS

55:05.040 --> 55:06.439
When you get to the river man

55:07.760 --> 55:08.795
pause a while.

55:11.400 --> 55:13.596
Your wife and your son
will be there shortly.

56:03.200 --> 56:04.156
ASTYANAX:
Astyanax.

56:07.960 --> 56:08.950
I'm an orphan.

56:11.760 --> 56:12.955
<i>HECTOR:
You're a son of Troy.</i>

56:15.280 --> 56:16.918
I'm ready to give my life for her.
