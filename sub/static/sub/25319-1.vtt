a ten-percent increase

- is the minimum that we need.

parachute force instead?

36:01.592 --> 36:03.260
Uh, parachute force

36:03.293 --> 36:05.362
would be dispersed
over too large an area.

36:05.395 --> 36:08.399
So we could use Lake Victoria.

36:08.432 --> 36:12.468
Either parachute in
with inflatable boats at night,

36:12.502 --> 36:14.438
or cross from Kenya.

36:14.471 --> 36:17.841
Ehud, there are crocodiles
in Lake Victoria.

36:17.874 --> 36:20.944
Plus, it's impossible to come
all the way across the lake

36:20.978 --> 36:23.214
from Kenya
in rubber boats unnoticed.

36:23.247 --> 36:25.816
This is not a drill, okay?

36:25.849 --> 36:27.451
It's the real world.

36:27.484 --> 36:31.355
Motta, why don't we send in
the commandos,

36:31.388 --> 36:34.491
take the airport, and then wait
to hear from Amin?

36:36.326 --> 36:38.662
Well...

36:38.695 --> 36:41.365
if you want to take control
of the airport,

36:41.398 --> 36:43.500
you're gonna have to use
a much bigger force.

36:43.533 --> 36:45.536
Could you run some numbers
for me?

36:45.569 --> 36:48.672
I want to present
a plan tomorrow.

36:48.705 --> 36:51.542
Also, call special forces
unit to base.

36:51.575 --> 36:53.544
Of course, Defense Minister.

36:53.577 --> 36:54.678
Thank you.

36:54.711 --> 36:56.214
No problem.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.690
I think I know why Rabin
wanted Motta here.

37:06.723 --> 37:09.259
He wants to stop us
from coming up

37:09.293 --> 37:12.463
with a viable military option.

37:12.496 --> 37:16.767
That way, he doesn't have
to make a decision.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.937
He wants to blame you
for this crisis.

37:21.738 --> 37:23.674
That's politics.

37:25.575 --> 37:27.278
(door opens)

37:27.311 --> 37:29.413
(door closes)

37:33.884 --> 37:36.287
(chuckling): You know,
I wish I could do that.

37:37.587 --> 37:40.024
There was a phone call.

37:40.057 --> 37:42.660
They want you back
at base tomorrow.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.397
When is the premiere?

37:47.531 --> 37:48.832
It's not about that.

37:48.865 --> 37:51.901
You know I have
no choice here, right?

37:51.935 --> 37:54.538
Sarah, I have to go.
It's my job.

37:54.571 --> 37:56.307
There's always a choice.

37:56.340 --> 37:57.375
That's not true.

37:59.009 --> 38:00.878
What choice
do those hostages have?

38:00.911 --> 38:02.880
If you think you have no choice,

38:02.913 --> 38:04.715
you're a hostage, too.

44:02.772 --> 44:04.775
Well, I-I'm a French citizen.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.143
I was working in Israel,

44:06.176 --> 44:08.412
and, uh, I've got
that I.D. card,

44:08.445 --> 44:09.913
which I handed in
with my passport.

44:09.946 --> 44:10.913
You are soldier.

44:10.947 --> 44:12.382
No, I'm French. I, uh...

44:12.415 --> 44:14.284
You are spy. (speaks Arabic)

44:14.317 --> 44:16.219
Wait.
No, I-I'm a French citizen.

44:16.252 --> 44:17.921

- All right.

44:17.954 --> 44:19.423

- Okay.

44:21.357 --> 44:23.026
He's French.

44:23.059 --> 44:24.695
He is your friend?

44:24.728 --> 44:26.864
- Yes. -Then you go
through there, too.

44:33.470 --> 44:35.305
For this plan to succeed,

44:35.338 --> 44:37.240
we need to use
a big enough force

44:37.273 --> 44:39.342
to seize control of the airport.

44:39.375 --> 44:42.446
First, we use the commandos,
kill the terrorists,

44:42.479 --> 44:44.080
secure the hostages.

44:44.114 --> 44:46.850
Then we fly in reinforcements.

44:46.883 --> 44:50.754
Heavy weaponry,
at least 1,000 men.

44:52.122 --> 44:54.124
You want to invade Uganda,
Shimon?

44:54.157 --> 44:58.195
Oh, we give it back to them
when we leave.

44:58.228 --> 45:00.330
We cannot invade a country
that is a member

45:00.363 --> 45:02.466
of the UN
and the African League.

45:02.499 --> 45:05.769
And it's impossible to move
a force of that size

45:05.802 --> 45:07.070
4,000 kilometers undetected.

45:07.103 --> 45:08.905
SHIMON:
We have to act.

45:08.938 --> 45:11.842
There can be no negotiations
with terrorists.

45:11.875 --> 45:14.411
I'm talking to
the chief of staff, Shimon.

45:14.444 --> 45:16.779
The soldier, not the politician.

45:16.813 --> 45:20.050
I have to agree
with the prime minister.

45:20.083 --> 45:22.252
RABIN: We need to find out
if Amin is helping them.

45:22.285 --> 45:24.821
You were in Uganda, right?
You dealt with him?

45:24.854 --> 45:26.923
I trained his army, yes.

45:26.956 --> 45:30.794
I'd like to assume he's not
gonna declare war on France.

45:30.827 --> 45:33.797
Having said that,
the man is absolutely crazy.

45:33.830 --> 45:37.167
He might have a dream,
some kind of a vision,

45:37.200 --> 45:40.203
and anything can happen.

45:40.236 --> 45:42.906
I can try... call him.

45:44.374 --> 45:46.276
If Amin is on
the terrorists' side,

45:46.309 --> 45:48.278
we may have to negotiate.

45:48.311 --> 45:53.049
SHIMON: Prime Minister, they
are asking for 52 terrorists.

45:53.082 --> 45:55.551
Israel cannot capitulate.
It cannot.

45:55.585 --> 45:57.521
They're going to start
killing the hostages

45:57.554 --> 46:00.023
the day after tomorrow.

46:00.056 --> 46:01.258
Call Amin.

46:01.291 --> 46:02.993
I want to know where he stands.

46:08.131 --> 46:09.966
They have moved
the Jews together

46:09.999 --> 46:11.968
at the old terminal at Entebbe.

46:12.001 --> 46:15.372
They have surrounded them
with high explosives.

46:15.405 --> 46:19.376
They have TNT on the plane
and all around the building,

46:19.409 --> 46:21.244
even on their bodies.

46:21.277 --> 46:25.415
They said that they will commit
suicide with the hostages.

46:25.448 --> 46:28.819
Tell your government
there is nothing I can do.

46:28.852 --> 46:31.054
MOTTA: But, Your Excellency,
this is your country.

46:31.087 --> 46:32.455
You have an opportunity

46:32.488 --> 46:35.424
to go down in history
as a great man.

46:35.458 --> 46:37.027
The man who saved these people.

46:37.060 --> 46:39.229
This is a-a great
opportunity, sir,

46:39.262 --> 46:40.831
given to you by God.

46:40.864 --> 46:42.933
AMIN: All the terrorists want
is for you

46:42.966 --> 46:45.202
to send your prisoners here.

46:45.235 --> 46:48.806
Don't listen to those from
the PFLP sitting beside you.

46:51.207 --> 46:53.276
You are offending me,
old friend.

46:53.309 --> 46:55.145
All I'm trying to do

46:55.178 --> 46:57.547
is make sure
the hostages are safe.

46:57.580 --> 46:59.082
MOTTA:
I'm sorry, Your Excellency,

46:59.115 --> 47:01.618
but please consider
what I'm saying.

47:01.651 --> 47:05.120
Don't miss this opportunity

47:05.154 --> 47:07.157
to show the people
who say bad things about you

47:07.190 --> 47:08.425
what a great man you are.

47:08.458 --> 47:10.527
Actually, I-I think this will

47:10.560 --> 47:12.328
get you the Nobel Prize
for peace.

47:16.466 --> 47:18.535
Uh, Y-Your Highness?

47:20.670 --> 47:22.306
Y-Your Highness?

47:27.310 --> 47:29.179
Why would the PFLP want us

47:29.212 --> 47:31.014
to fly their prisoners
to Uganda?

47:31.047 --> 47:34.251
I think that's Amin,
not the Palestinians.

47:34.284 --> 47:36.486
He wants to be there when
the prisoners are released.

47:36.519 --> 47:38.622
He wants to show the Soviets
and the Arabs

47:38.655 --> 47:40.457
that he is with them now.

47:40.490 --> 47:44.361
He wants their approval,
their support, their arms.

47:44.394 --> 47:46.428
The $5 million.

47:46.462 --> 47:48.431
If the Ugandans
are with the terrorists,

47:48.464 --> 47:50.967
this operation
will have to be even bigger.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.169
SHIMON:
I spoke to Kissinger.

47:53.202 --> 47:55.972
He said it's better
if everybody dies

47:56.005 --> 47:58.008
than we negotiate.

47:58.041 --> 48:00.176
Yeah, well,
if it's not a French problem,

48:00.209 --> 48:03.680
then it's even less
of an American problem, Shimon.

48:03.713 --> 48:07.050
(sighs) Let's do
the only thing we can do.

48:07.083 --> 48:09.052
No, wait. Please.

48:11.187 --> 48:12.589
Yitzhak.

48:14.357 --> 48:17.594
Shimon, let me explain
the situation as it stands.

48:17.627 --> 48:19.229
We have no intelligence.

48:19.262 --> 48:21.331
We only know the hostages
are in the terminal.

48:21.364 --> 48:22.632
Nothing else.

48:22.665 --> 48:24.367
What if they moved
them around last night?

48:24.400 --> 48:25.936
What if now
we have people sitting

48:25.969 --> 48:27.713
in the middle of them
with guns and grenades?

48:27.737 --> 48:29.372
As soon as they know
we're coming,

48:29.405 --> 48:32.075
they start to kill the men,
the women, the children.

48:32.108 --> 48:35.479
So they are selecting Jews,
and you want to negotiate.

The hijackers put off their
deadline to 8:00 a.m. Sunday

01:03:38.513 --> 01:03:40.982
after Israel broke
its long-standing policy

01:03:41.016 --> 01:03:42.418
and agreed to negotiate.

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:44.086
The difference of opinion
in Israel

01:03:44.119 --> 01:03:46.222
is not over whether the
hostages should be released,

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:48.457
but over whether releasing
terrorists from jail here

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:50.392
is too high a price
to pay for it.

01:03:50.425 --> 01:03:53.562
<i>Tonight, a special series
of prayers began</i>

01:03:53.595 --> 01:03:56.064
<i>at the Western Wall
and at most synagogues.</i>

01:03:56.098 --> 01:03:58.467
<i>Prayers which expressed
the hope that the government</i>

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.569
<i>made the right decision
on the negotiations</i>

01:04:00.602 --> 01:04:02.437
<i>and that the Israeli
and Jewish hostages</i>

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:05.474
<i>will indeed come out
of Uganda safely.</i>

01:04:05.507 --> 01:04:07.944
(insects chirping)

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:59.228
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

01:04:59.261 --> 01:05:00.963
You left your gun
lying on the wall.

01:05:00.996 --> 01:05:02.665
One of the Jews
could have picked it up.

01:05:02.698 --> 01:05:04.566
Relax, man.
The Israelis have surrendered.

01:05:04.599 --> 01:05:06.568
They have not surrendered.

01:05:06.601 --> 01:05:08.270
What if this is a trick?

01:05:08.303 --> 01:05:10.038
What if they are buying
more time?

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:12.508
- We have to be ready.
- Okay, okay.

01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:17.046
Why are you here?

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:22.651
I want to throw bombs

01:05:22.684 --> 01:05:25.054
into the consciousness
of the masses.

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:28.257
And what if you have to throw
a real bomb, my friend?

01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:29.959
Have you killed?

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:32.228
You think you can do it?

01:05:33.662 --> 01:05:37.031
You choose to pick up arms
and fight.

01:05:37.065 --> 01:05:39.335
You choose to come here.

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:42.337
You could have
a nice life in Europe.

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:44.540
I wish I had your life.

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:46.642
I would not pick up a gun.

01:05:46.675 --> 01:05:49.078
Only people with nothing
understand.

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:51.013
The Jews understand.

01:05:52.514 --> 01:05:54.717
When your people massacred them,

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:58.120
the ones who survived
had nothing.

01:05:58.153 --> 01:06:00.990
They brought their dead
to Palestine.

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:03.159
They brought
their shame and humiliation.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:08.697
They did what was done to them
to us.

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:12.234
But I didn't do it to them.

01:06:12.267 --> 01:06:13.970
You did it to them.

01:06:16.538 --> 01:06:19.375
You are here because
you hate your country.

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.711
I'm here because I love mine.

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:27.049
Are you ready to kill?

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.319
Are you ready to die?

01:06:34.389 --> 01:06:36.592
If this negotiation is a trick,

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:38.561
we start killing immediately.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.432
Immediately.

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:05.054
BENNY: We can fly down
over the Red Sea

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:07.289
at low level
to avoid enemy radar.

01:07:07.322 --> 01:07:10.225
When the last plane
leaves at 23:45,

01:07:10.258 --> 01:07:13.796
the runway lights stay on
for 15 minutes.

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:17.366
- That's our window.
- SHIMON: Mm.

01:07:17.399 --> 01:07:19.801
The Ugandan soldiers
have nothing at stake.

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.603
Once they see us
when we get there,

01:07:21.636 --> 01:07:23.481
- they will start running.
- MOTTA: Just a second there.

01:07:23.505 --> 01:07:26.208
You said you didn't have
enough fuel, right?

01:07:26.241 --> 01:07:27.810
- (tapping table)
- This is crucial.

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:30.345
Yeah, we're gonna have
to refuel on our way back home.

01:07:30.378 --> 01:07:33.382
Sir, Kenya will be
the best place to do it.

01:07:33.415 --> 01:07:34.650
Motta.

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:36.819
This operation
is not gonna succeed.

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:39.555
This is a charade, okay?
This... it's fantasy.

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:41.590
The Germans separated the Jews.

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:46.361
Selection, Motta.

01:07:46.394 --> 01:07:48.629
We can't just sit here,
do nothing.

01:07:48.663 --> 01:07:50.833
These are my men.

01:07:50.866 --> 01:07:54.303
If they die,
it's my responsibility.

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.738
No, Motta.
They are Israeli soldiers.

01:07:56.771 --> 01:07:59.108
It's the prime minister's
responsibility.

01:08:03.678 --> 01:08:06.549
Are you going to back me up
on this, Motta?

01:08:18.827 --> 01:08:21.096
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:23.899
They're negotiating.

01:08:23.932 --> 01:08:25.867
You think they're gonna
call you back?

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:28.403
I don't think the operation's
gonna be approved, but...

01:08:28.435 --> 01:08:30.371
we have to practice.

01:08:31.473 --> 01:08:33.442
Why does it have to be you?

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:35.676
How many times
are we gonna talk about this?

01:08:35.710 --> 01:08:38.147
We can't just be at war
all the time.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.916
You're not at war all the time.
You're a dancer.

01:08:40.948 --> 01:08:43.719
I fight so you can dance.

01:08:45.886 --> 01:08:49.258
What if I stop dancing?

01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:57.165
(phone ringing)

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:03.805
Yeah.

01:09:06.774 --> 01:09:07.942
ALI:
Calm down.

01:09:07.975 --> 01:09:09.478
Quiet, quiet.

01:09:09.511 --> 01:09:11.212
Listen.

01:09:11.246 --> 01:09:14.716
The Israeli government
has agreed to negotiate.

01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:18.786
The deadline has been extended
until 11:00 a.m. on Sunday.

01:09:18.819 --> 01:09:20.354
(applause)

01:09:20.388 --> 01:09:22.323
As a gesture of goodwill,

01:09:22.357 --> 01:09:24.426
we have released
all French nationals.

01:09:24.459 --> 01:09:26.361
And then,
once our comrades are freed,

01:09:26.394 --> 01:09:28.397
you will all be free.

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.399
You can go back
to the big room now.

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:32.934
- (applause)
- Come on.

01:09:34.236 --> 01:09:35.836
Come on.

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:37.839
Israel never negotiates.

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:39.841
- BOSE: Come on, everyone.
- No.

01:09:59.027 --> 01:10:02.264
(woman continues crying)

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:17.379
Where do you think
you are going?

01:10:17.412 --> 01:10:19.615
This is a letter for my wife.

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:28.724
Hurry up.

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:37.366
<i>- Oui, monsieur.
- Merci.</i>

01:10:47.442 --> 01:10:49.411
(quiet chatter)

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:02.524
(speaking French)

01:11:14.569 --> 01:11:16.538
(quiet conversation in French)

01:11:20.375 --> 01:11:21.743
Here.

01:11:21.776 --> 01:11:23.879
- I'll take care of it.
- (groans)

01:11:25.513 --> 01:11:26.915
(coughs)

01:11:44.432 --> 01:11:45.934
Yeah.

01:11:57.145 --> 01:11:59.381
(engine idling)

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.752
(engine shuts off)

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:06.021
What is this?

01:12:06.054 --> 01:12:08.390
Huh? It's supposed to be black.

01:12:08.423 --> 01:12:10.492
- Hey, it's the only color
they had. -Yeah.

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:18.433
You gotta be kidding me, right?

01:12:18.466 --> 01:12:20.869
<i>I want the best shooters
of the unit</i>

01:12:20.902 --> 01:12:22.871
<i>inside the Mercedes with me.</i>

01:12:22.904 --> 01:12:24.773
<i>We're gonna raid the terminal
in five teams.</i>

01:12:24.806 --> 01:12:26.775
Joshua will lead the first team.

01:12:26.808 --> 01:12:28.110
Muki, second team.

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:30.445
Zeev, third team.

01:12:30.478 --> 01:12:33.148
Amos and Erez, fourth and fifth.

01:12:33.181 --> 01:12:35.983
We're gonna land here
in the new terminal runway,

01:12:36.017 --> 01:12:37.853
all the way to here.

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:40.422
We're gonna go out in one
Mercedes and two Land Rovers.

01:12:40.455 --> 01:12:42.557
We're gonna drive all the way
to the old terminal.

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:44.126
We're gonna park
under the tower,

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:46.594
hidden from sniper fire.

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.096
Surprise and speed is the key.

01:12:48.129 --> 01:12:52.033
<i>And if the prime minister
approves this mission,</i>

01:12:52.066 --> 01:12:53.769
<i>we will go.</i>

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:55.170
RABIN: <i>
The terrorists only need</i>

01:12:55.203 --> 01:12:56.805
<i>a few minutes to kill everyone.</i>

01:12:56.838 --> 01:12:59.107
What if the first plane
is identified and attacked

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:02.544
before the rest of the force
has time to land and deploy?

01:13:02.577 --> 01:13:04.946
They won't stand a chance.

01:13:04.979 --> 01:13:07.182
And if it fails,

01:13:07.215 --> 01:13:10.685
the blow to the IDF,
to Israel, will be...

01:13:10.718 --> 01:13:12.488
catastrophic.

01:13:14.055 --> 01:13:16.591
Anyway, I am bound
by the Cabinet's decision.

01:13:16.624 --> 01:13:19.928
Yitzhak, you are the Cabinet.

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:25.667

01:16:08.963 --> 01:16:10.799
Can you do it, Yoni?

01:16:18.339 --> 01:16:19.941
RABIN (over phone):
Is there anything

01:16:19.974 --> 01:16:21.285
blocking their path
to the hostages?

01:16:21.309 --> 01:16:22.844
EHUD:
No, sir.

01:16:22.877 --> 01:16:26.982
There are no obstacles
around the terminal.

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:30.051
Nothing to stop our men
reaching the hostages.

01:16:30.084 --> 01:16:32.721
I want the photograph to reach
the men before they leave.

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:34.289
Thank you.

01:16:37.258 --> 01:16:40.128
There's nothing to stop
the operation from proceeding.

01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:42.163
So now you have
to make a decision.

01:16:42.196 --> 01:16:43.798
If I was still a general,

01:16:43.831 --> 01:16:45.867
I would never approve
this mission.

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.370
It's a huge risk.

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:52.140
YONI: There will be casualties.
You all know that.

01:16:52.173 --> 01:16:56.143
What we cannot doubt
is the mission.

01:16:56.177 --> 01:16:58.112
We must complete our objective.

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:00.915
We need to get to the terminal
in three minutes,

01:17:00.948 --> 01:17:03.685
kill all the terrorists
and rescue the hostages.

01:17:03.718 --> 01:17:05.253
And we don't stop for nothing

01:17:05.286 --> 01:17:07.689
