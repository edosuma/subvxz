01:50.009 --> 01:50.976
Yo.

01:51.177 --> 01:53.202
Hey, I was doing some research
for next year...

01:53.413 --> 01:56.313
...and I think I figured out
which website I wanna subscribe to.

01:56.516 --> 01:59.542
- The Vag-tastic Voyage.
- Which one is the Vag-tastic Voyage?

01:59.751 --> 02:01.515
<i>The Vag-tastic Voyage</i>
<i>is the one where...</i>

02:01.721 --> 02:05.020
<i>... they find random girls on the street,</i>
<i>and they invite them into a van...</i>

02:05.225 --> 02:06.988
...and then they bang them
in the van.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.455
It's like 13 bucks a month...

02:08.661 --> 02:10.322
...and you get access
to other sites.

02:10.530 --> 02:14.830
Like one's Latina, one's Asian,
you know, there's one for fetishes...

02:15.034 --> 02:17.525
...like feet and pee-pee and shit
and stuff like that.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.500
That's disgusting.
You're like an animal.

02:19.706 --> 02:22.174
I'm... What? I'm disgusting?
You're the weird one, man.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.343
Don't make me feel weird
because I like porn.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.842
You're weird for not liking porn.
I'm normal as shit.

02:27.046 --> 02:28.809
Peeing on people. That's normal?

02:29.015 --> 02:31.347
Evan, I'm not saying
I'm gonna look at it.

02:31.551 --> 02:33.917
I'm just saying that
it comes with the site, okay?

02:34.120 --> 02:36.486
I don't know what I'm gonna be into
10 years from now.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.384
I'm just sick of all the amateur stuff.

02:38.591 --> 02:41.754
I mean, like, if I'm paying top dollar,
I want a little production value.

02:41.961 --> 02:44.691
Like some editing, transition,
something. Some music.

02:44.898 --> 02:48.732
Yeah, well, I'm sorry the Coen brothers
don't direct the porn that I watch.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.493
They're hard to get ahold of, okay?

02:50.703 --> 02:53.536
Plus your parents are gonna be
looking at the bill, dipshit.

02:53.740 --> 02:58.143
Yeah, you're right. I probably should
pick the one with the least dirty name.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.439
What about, like, Perfect Ten?

03:02.649 --> 03:04.446
Something like that, you know?

03:04.651 --> 03:06.209
Like Perfect Ten?

03:06.419 --> 03:08.250
Because that could be
any number of things.

03:08.454 --> 03:11.821
They can't really get you for that.
That could be, like, a bowling website.

03:12.559 --> 03:16.051
Yeah, but they don't really show dick
going in, which is a huge concern.

03:16.262 --> 03:17.229
I didn't realize that.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.990
Plus, have you ever seen
a vagina by itself?

03:21.334 --> 03:22.596
Not for me.

03:22.802 --> 03:24.235
Hi.

03:25.104 --> 03:28.232
- Thanks for taking him, Seth.
- No... No problem, Jane.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.671
- How are you?
- Good.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.469
Beautiful.

03:33.446 --> 03:35.073
- Don't touch that.
- What are you...?

03:35.281 --> 03:37.374
- I'm not a piece of meat.
- You two are funny.

03:38.184 --> 03:41.347
I can't imagine what you're gonna do
without each other next year.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.579
Evan told me
you didn't get into Dartmouth.

03:44.424 --> 03:48.451
I got into some schools, some
pretty good ones. So I'll be fine.

03:48.661 --> 03:51.653
- You gonna miss each other?
- No. Miss each other? No, thank you.

03:51.864 --> 03:53.422
I don't... I don't miss each other.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.430
I'm gonna cry myself
to sleep every night.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.193
- Me too.
- When I'm out partying.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.995
Go to school, boys.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.166
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Jane.

04:03.509 --> 04:08.208
I am truly jealous you got to suck
on those tits when you were a baby.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.315
Yeah, well, at least you got to
suck on your dad's dick.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.655
Hey, Seth,
you can't park in the faculty lot.

04:25.865 --> 04:28.766
Don't be such a vagine, man.
I gotta get a Red Bull before class.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.927
You're being an idiot.
You shouldn't have parked there.

04:33.139 --> 04:34.663
Fuck it. I'm about to graduate.

04:34.874 --> 04:37.638
They should be sucking
on my ball sac.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.572
It's the least they could do
for stealing three years of my life.

04:44.684 --> 04:48.245
- Oh, fuck me.
- Look at those nipples.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.388
They're like little baby toes.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.649
It's not fair
they get to flaunt that stuff...

04:52.859 --> 04:54.952
...and I have to hide
every erection I get.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.789
You know what I do?
I flip my boner up into my waistband.

04:57.997 --> 04:59.988
It hides it and it feels awesome.

05:00.199 --> 05:02.633
I almost blew a load
into my bellybutton.

05:02.835 --> 05:05.804
I mean, just imagine if girls weren't
weirded out by our boners...

05:06.005 --> 05:07.666
...and just, like,
wanted to see them.

05:07.874 --> 05:10.968
I mean, that's the world
I one day wanna live in.

05:11.177 --> 05:14.305
It's been two years since I've seen
an actual human female nipple.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.482
Shauna?
Shauna was two years ago now?

05:16.683 --> 05:17.650
Yeah.

05:17.850 --> 05:20.284
Yeah, I guess so.
But she was insanely hot.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.683
Exactly. She was too hot, okay?
That's what sucks.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.154
How can that suck?
I'd be psyched if I got with her.

05:26.359 --> 05:27.849
You got, like, two dozen handjobs.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.757
Yes, and three-quarters of a blowjob,
but who's counting?

05:30.963 --> 05:33.056
Look, it was the peak
of my ass-getting career...

05:33.266 --> 05:34.824
...and it happened way too early.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.968
- You're like Orson Welles.
- Exactly!

05:37.170 --> 05:39.661
If I'd paced myself,
I'd be having at least steady sex...

05:39.872 --> 05:41.169
...with a decent-looking girl.

05:41.374 --> 05:44.343
I honestly see now why Orson Welles
ate his fat ass to death.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.341
You'll have sex in college,
everyone does.

05:46.546 --> 05:49.640
But the point is to be good at sex
by the time you get to college.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.682
You don't want girls thinking
you suck dick at fucking pussy.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.853
I still think you have
a chance with Jules.

05:55.054 --> 05:56.851
She got incredibly hot over
last summer...

05:57.056 --> 05:59.024
...and she obviously
hasn't realized it yet...

05:59.225 --> 06:01.887
...because she's still talking to you
and flirting with you.

06:02.095 --> 06:05.121
Are you out of your mind?
Look at Jules' dating record, okay?

06:05.331 --> 06:08.664
She dated Dan Remick, who's had
a six-pack since, like, kindergarten.

06:08.868 --> 06:12.429
Jason Stone, who looks like
fucking Zack Morris. And Matt Muir.

06:12.638 --> 06:14.902
Matt Muir.
He's the sweetest guy ever.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.939
Have you ever stared into his eyes?

06:17.143 --> 06:19.703
It was like the first time
I heard the Beatles.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.973
Why would she end
her high school career with me?

06:23.182 --> 06:25.207
Becca dated Eric Rosecrantz
for like two years.

06:25.418 --> 06:28.717
Yeah, but he's a fucking idiot.
You're a step up from that dick-load.

06:28.921 --> 06:31.014
That's why you need to stop...
Will you get this?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.624
That's why you need to stop
being a pussy and nail her.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.589
You could bang her
before you leave.

06:35.795 --> 06:38.730
And I'm not gonna dance around it,
she looks like a good fucker.

06:38.931 --> 06:41.331
I'm tired of you talking
about her like that, man.

06:41.534 --> 06:44.992
What, you can talk about her all day
and if I say one thing, it's blasphemy?

06:45.204 --> 06:46.762
Well, I don't constantly insult her.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.372
I'm not trying to insult her.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.099
I'm just saying that
she looks like a good fucker, okay?

06:51.310 --> 06:52.834
She looks like she can take a dick.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.605
Some women pride themselves
on their dick-taking abilities.

06:55.815 --> 06:58.716
Dick-taking abilities? You think
that's good to say about someone?

06:58.918 --> 07:01.113
The fucked-up thing is,
I actually do, okay?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.915
If a woman tried to compliment me on
my dick-giving abilities, I'd be psyched.

07:05.124 --> 07:06.489
Hey, yo, Seth.

07:08.761 --> 07:09.728
What?

07:09.929 --> 07:12.955
Did you hear I'm having
a big grad party next Saturday?

07:14.901 --> 07:16.334
- No.
- Yeah.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.903
- Oh, shit!
- You're not coming.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.804
Tell your fucking faggot friend
he can't come either.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.143
So Jesse wanted me to tell you...

07:30.349 --> 07:32.715
...you're a fucking faggot
and can't come to his party.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.784
You really bitched out
back there, man.

07:34.987 --> 07:36.318
I bitched out?

07:36.522 --> 07:39.286
You bitched out, man,
you fucking Judas.

07:39.492 --> 07:40.686
You fucking left me hanging.

07:40.893 --> 07:42.884
Did you want me to dive
in front of his spit?

07:45.932 --> 07:48.025
Come on, guys, let's go!

08:03.015 --> 08:04.539
This is bullshit.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.877
Pussy.

08:07.420 --> 08:11.049
If I equals the square root
of negative one...

08:11.257 --> 08:16.820
...then I squared equals
negative one. Okay?

08:17.029 --> 08:19.259
In other words,
if you consider I as a constant...

08:19.465 --> 08:23.231
...you can then define the square roots
of all the negative numbers.

08:23.669 --> 08:28.106
So I is an imaginary number.
It doesn't really exist.

08:28.307 --> 08:31.367
If I equals the square root
of negative one...

08:31.577 --> 08:33.568
...then I squared equals
negative one.

08:33.779 --> 08:36.441
Is this making s...? Okay.

08:43.054 --> 08:44.352
- Okay, bye.
- Evan!

08:44.891 --> 08:46.358
- Evan, hey.
- Hey, Becca.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.151
- Hey, thank you for your pen.
- Hey.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.989
No problem. No, no, don't worry.
No worries. You keep it.

08:51.197 --> 08:54.758
You won't have to borrow one again
because you'll have that one.

08:54.967 --> 08:58.835
- Thank you so much, that's...
- You're welcome. Don't worry about it.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.665
So I was gonna ask you...

09:00.873 --> 09:03.364
...did you hear about
Jesse's grad party next weekend?

09:03.576 --> 09:07.137
- It should be fun.
- I heard. I... It's a maybe.

09:07.346 --> 09:08.836
- Really?
- For me at the moment.

09:09.348 --> 09:10.576
- My R.S.V.P.
- Just a maybe?

09:10.783 --> 09:11.750
So far.

09:11.951 --> 09:14.613
There's so much other fun shit
that's gonna be happening...

09:14.820 --> 09:17.846
...that I can't really commit and,
you know, hurt someone's feelings.

09:18.057 --> 09:21.117
Fun shit? But I never see you
at parties or anything.

09:21.994 --> 09:24.792
That's because of
all the other fun shit I'm off doing.

09:24.997 --> 09:26.726
I'd love to be at all of them, but...

09:26.933 --> 09:28.764
Why weren't you
at Dimitri's on Saturday?

09:28.968 --> 09:30.458
There was so many things
going on.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.763
I couldn't find a minute
to make an appearance.

09:32.972 --> 09:36.408
- What did you do?
- Saturday was a crazy night for me.

09:39.478 --> 09:41.412
<i>I had some friends over,</i>
<i>we had a few drinks.</i>

09:41.614 --> 09:43.445
<i>That's Vag-tastic!</i>

09:43.649 --> 09:46.379
<i>I hung out in my basement,</i>
<i>the chill zone, where we chill-lax.</i>

09:46.586 --> 09:49.214
<i>Like "relax" and "chill"</i>
<i>all at once.</i>

09:50.323 --> 09:51.813
Seth's parents
were throwing a party.

09:52.024 --> 09:54.959
<i>We got to hang around adults,</i>
<i>which was a nice change of pace.</i>

09:55.161 --> 09:58.597
<i>You converse, you talk to people</i>
<i>and they have interesting stories.</i>

09:58.798 --> 10:02.461
<i>I talked to a man who claimed he had</i>
<i>climbed five mountains in his life.</i>

10:02.835 --> 10:06.100
Then we went to a nightclub, which
was incredible. This big, fancy one.

10:06.305 --> 10:09.069
- Gonna look at tits right now!
- <i>I'm feeling crazy. I said that.</i>

10:10.443 --> 10:11.740
- <i>You got in?</i>
- <i>We got right in.</i>

10:11.944 --> 10:13.741
- Wanna do this, 'roid monkey?
- Fuck you!

10:13.946 --> 10:17.313
<i>Then we called it a night.</i>
<i>We were all just really exhausted.</i>

10:17.516 --> 10:19.279
What the fuck?!

10:19.485 --> 10:22.716
You would've loved it. It was
an incredible, unbelievable night.

10:22.922 --> 10:24.219
That sounds like a lot of fun.

10:24.423 --> 10:27.324
You know, I'd love to go
do something like that sometime.

10:27.526 --> 10:29.153
Who wouldn't? I mean, it was like...

10:29.362 --> 10:32.559
...me and Seth are
always kind of cooking up these...

10:32.765 --> 10:35.393
...fun, sort of,
little, you know, events.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.331
I guess you guys are really
gonna go crazy next year together.

10:38.537 --> 10:41.267
We were going to,
but we got into different schools.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.499
Really? That sucks.

10:43.909 --> 10:46.935
Yeah, I mean, it's not too bad.
I mean, it should be okay.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.704
Not too worried about it, really.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.508
Don't worry about it.
I'm not worried at all.

10:52.218 --> 10:56.621
- All right, well, thank you for the pen.
- Yeah. No problem.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.689
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.156
Bye, Evan.

11:11.203 --> 11:14.536
Mrs. Hayworth, I joined this class
because I'd be cooking with a partner.

11:14.740 --> 11:18.301
But she's never here, and I don't get
twice the grades for doing all the work.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.570
I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.806
I know, but look at Evan, okay?
Just look at him.

11:24.016 --> 11:27.474
Don't keep me waiting much longer.
I'm getting impatient up here.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.485
You know what I'm talking about.
Miroki, you're embarrassing me.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.091
I'm here in my unit, isolated and alone,
eating my terrible-tasting food...

11:34.293 --> 11:35.760
...and I gotta look over at that.

11:35.961 --> 11:38.156
Looks like the most fun
I've ever seen in my life.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.492
And it's B.S. Excuse my language.
I'm just saying that I wash and dry.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.827
I'm like a single mother.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.003
We all know Home Ec is a joke,
no offense.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.605
Everyone takes this class to get an A.
It's bullshit, and I'm sorry.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.743
I'm not putting down your profession,
but it's just the way I feel.

11:51.944 --> 11:54.242
I don't wanna sit here alone
cooking this shitty food.

11:54.447 --> 11:58.406
No offense. And I just think
that I don't ever need to cook tiramisu.

11:58.617 --> 12:00.346
When am I gonna need
to cook tiramisu?

12:00.553 --> 12:01.918
Am I gonna be a chef? No.

12:02.121 --> 12:05.113
There's three weeks left in school.
Give me a fucking break.

12:05.324 --> 12:07.485
I'm sorry for cursing.

12:08.694 --> 12:10.992
All right, Jules' partner isn't here
today either.

12:11.197 --> 12:12.630
Pair up with her. Station four.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.957
Jules?

12:16.235 --> 12:18.032
All right. I'll give it another shot.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.228
I'll give Home Ec another shot.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.044
Hey, Jules.
Your partner didn't come today?

12:32.952 --> 12:34.783
- That's kind of a personal question.
- What?

12:35.421 --> 12:38.447
Nothing. It's my attempt at humor.
I was just...

12:38.758 --> 12:40.453
Oh, like coming.

12:40.659 --> 12:42.718
Like "coming" coming.

12:44.296 --> 12:47.265
Wow, that was a little too far
right there. The gesture.

12:47.466 --> 12:50.367
Yeah. It's pretty far.
Shit, I do that...

12:50.569 --> 12:52.935
No, don't worry.
I'm actually used to it.

12:53.139 --> 12:55.733
My older brother says, like,
the nastiest shit.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.068
Like he called me "hymen"
until I was 12.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.812
- That's sick. That's not even clever.
- I know.

13:01.013 --> 13:01.980
I know.

13:02.181 --> 13:04.741
I would've gone with something
at least mildly entertaining.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.350
You know, like... Like...
Like "family Jules."

13:07.553 --> 13:11.956
Or like "nuts." Yeah, that's funny.
That's a fucking funny joke.

13:12.391 --> 13:14.359
Fucking funny.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.929
- I can't believe that.
- So, all right. We gotta...

13:18.130 --> 13:19.097
...mix it up.

13:54.967 --> 13:59.336
Yeah, Hayworth will notice this,
if we cover it with chocolate.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.831
- The whole thing?
- Just dump it on. I'm serious.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.065
Okay.

14:03.876 --> 14:06.743
- And now it looks professional.
- That's really impressive.

14:06.946 --> 14:09.380
- It's beautifully done.
- I think we're gonna get an A.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.976
So, what are you doing tonight?

14:14.320 --> 14:16.049
- Probably nothing. Why?
- I don't know.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.246
My parents are gone
so I'm having a party.

14:18.457 --> 14:21.051
I don't really know how many people
are gonna be there...

14:21.260 --> 14:23.524
...but you could stop by
if you wanted to.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.223
Yeah, I love parties.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.257
Really?

14:28.634 --> 14:30.966
I just don't really ever
see you at them.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.865
You know, it's a love-hate thing.

14:33.072 --> 14:36.405
So, like, you know, right now,
I really love them, though.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.076
- Yeah.
- Good shit, right, Miroki?

14:40.479 --> 14:41.571
Yeah.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.408
Hey, Miroki, could we have
a minute alone? Just... Thanks.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.177
Dude, Jules is having
a fucking party.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.751
Hey!

14:49.154 --> 14:52.419
- Don't tell Fogell about the party.
- Gangsters. What's up, guys?

14:52.925 --> 14:55.951
I was just walking down the hall
and Nicola was right in front of me.

14:56.161 --> 14:59.096
She's wearing these tight white pants
with this black G-string...

14:59.298 --> 15:02.324
...and you could see right
through the pants. It was so sweet.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.844
It's 10:33.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.716
What?

15:20.786 --> 15:22.048
I told her what time it was.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.189
That's the coolest fucking story
I've ever heard in my entire life.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.951
- Can I hear it again? You have time?
- Yeah, yeah, Seth.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.958
I'll miss your knee-slappers
when me and Evan are at Dartmouth.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.256
While you guys are at Dartmouth,
I'll be at State...

15:33.465 --> 15:36.559
...where the girls are half as smart
and twice as likely to fellash me.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.169
What are you guys doing tonight?
Asshole.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.566
We got nothing.
Nothing tonight, Fogell.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.641
No? Well, if nothing comes up,
we can get shitfaced again, yeah?

15:44.843 --> 15:47.573
You're always calling me a pussy,
but today you're wrong.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.214
At lunch, I'm going to the same place
Mike Snider went...

15:50.416 --> 15:52.782
...to pick up my brand-new fake ID.

15:53.652 --> 15:57.088
Yeah. Fake ID. Fake ID. I'm tight.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.723
That's insane. Evan was like,
"I heard about this party.

15:59.925 --> 16:02.860
We shouldn't tell Fogell."
I was like, "No, we should tell Fogell."

16:03.062 --> 16:05.189
You could buy us booze now.
It's awesome.

16:05.397 --> 16:08.855
Yeah, I'll... Sure, I'll buy the booze.
Yeah, we're gonna get our drinks on.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.559
We're gonna party
and get crunk and rock out, dude.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.829
If you're not in this class,
leave this class.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.200
Fogell! Hi.

16:16.408 --> 16:17.466
Okay. Gotta go.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.667
Well done. Seriously.
See you after class.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.008
You tell that idiot
you're not rooming with him?

16:22.214 --> 16:23.181
Not yet. No.

16:23.382 --> 16:26.112
All right, well, you better.
That guy's the fucking anti-poon.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.252
Seth, it's dishes time.
What's the holdup?

16:28.687 --> 16:30.712
We're getting a fake ID, so...

16:30.923 --> 16:33.687
- It's not like a big deal.
- Wow, that's cool.

16:33.892 --> 16:36.019
But you guys have, like,
four more years to go...

16:36.228 --> 16:37.627
...so do you wanna get to work?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.196
Well, we got into
different schools, so...

16:40.399 --> 16:42.492
So you're cutting the cord?
What's gonna happen?

16:42.701 --> 16:45.261
Nothing. Jeez, what does
everybody think is gonna happen?

16:45.471 --> 16:48.304
The world's gonna explode if we
don't spend every second together?

16:48.507 --> 16:50.873
I mean, we're not dependent
on each other, you know.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.476
We met when we were 8.
We were fine before then.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.477
I was. I mean, it's like,
we don't do everything together.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.377
No. All right, I gotta take a piss.

16:58.584 --> 17:01.212
My dick's not gonna shake itself.
Come on, babe.

17:03.455 --> 17:06.185
- He's a crack-up.
- I'm just gonna go.

17:08.993 --> 17:11.359
Well, at least
we're getting a graduation party.

17:11.563 --> 17:12.689
Thank God, man.

17:12.897 --> 17:14.762
I'm excited.

17:14.967 --> 17:18.425
I would do terrible, disgusting things
to hook up with Jules.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.400
- Unforgivable things.
- I hear you, man.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.733
I'd give my middle nut
to start dating Becca.

17:22.941 --> 17:24.840
Becca's a bitch.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.672
You know what? I'm seriously
getting fucking sick of you...

17:27.880 --> 17:30.314
...talking about her like that,
if we can be honest.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.143
- Me too.
- Why do you hate her so much?

17:32.351 --> 17:34.751
You've never given me a reason.
I think you like her.

17:35.154 --> 17:38.248
- Fuck no, man! I hate Becca.
- Why, man?

17:38.457 --> 17:40.925
Fine, Evan. Here it comes.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.924
When I was a little kid,
I kind of had this problem.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.756
And it's not even that big of a deal.

17:45.964 --> 17:48.694
Something like 8 percent of kids
do it, but whatever. It's...

17:48.901 --> 17:55.329
For some reason, I don't know why,
I would just kind of sit around all day...

17:57.076 --> 17:58.873
...and draw pictures of dicks.

18:00.946 --> 18:02.004
What?

18:02.514 --> 18:04.641
Draw pictures of dicks.

18:04.983 --> 18:06.382
Dicks?

18:06.585 --> 18:08.382
Like a man dick?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.889
Yeah. Like a man dick.

18:13.692 --> 18:16.957
<i>I'd sit there for hours, drawing dicks.</i>
<i>I don't know what it was.</i>

18:17.162 --> 18:20.928
<i>I couldn't touch the pen to paper</i>
<i>without drawing the shape of a penis.</i>

18:21.133 --> 18:23.397
- <i>That's fucked.</i>
- <i>No shit, it's really fucked up.</i>

18:23.602 --> 18:24.864
<i>Here I am, this little kid...</i>

18:25.070 --> 18:28.005
<i>... and I can't stop drawing dicks</i>
<i>to save my own life.</i>

18:37.082 --> 18:39.812
All right. I mean, I don't see
what this has to do with Becca.

18:40.018 --> 18:42.384
Just listen. Okay?

18:42.588 --> 18:45.751
<i>Your precious little Becca</i>
<i>sat next to me for all of fourth grade.</i>

18:46.458 --> 18:50.087
<i>And in the classroom is where</i>
<i>I did the majority of my illustrations.</i>

18:50.929 --> 18:54.126
<i>I was very secretive about this</i>
<i>whole dick operation I had going on.</i>

18:54.333 --> 18:55.891
<i>Even I thought I was fucking crazy.</i>

18:56.101 --> 18:57.762
<i>Imagine what everyone else</i>
<i>would think.</i>

18:57.970 --> 18:59.938
<i>So I would stash</i>
<i>all of my dick drawings...</i>

19:00.139 --> 19:03.006
<i>... in this</i> Ghostbusters <i>lunchbox</i>
<i>that I had.</i>

19:03.208 --> 19:07.406
<i>So one day I'm finishing up this</i>
<i>real big, veiny, triumphant bastard.</i>

19:07.613 --> 19:08.705
<i>All of a sudden...</i>

19:08.914 --> 19:10.643
Pussy!

19:13.085 --> 19:15.019
You hit Becca's foot with your dick?

19:15.220 --> 19:17.950
Yeah. I know.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.439
Oh, my God!

19:34.773 --> 19:38.903
<i>She starts crying. She flips out.</i>
<i>And she rats me out to the principal.</i>

19:39.111 --> 19:41.602
<i>He finds this</i> Ghostbusters <i>lunchbox</i>
<i>dick treasure chest...</i>

19:41.813 --> 19:43.212
<i>... and he fucking flips out.</i>

19:52.624 --> 19:56.060
<i>He calls in my parents. Turns out this</i>
<i>principal is some religious fanatic...</i>

19:56.261 --> 19:58.422
<i>... and he thinks I'm possessed</i>
<i>by some dick devil.</i>

19:58.630 --> 20:02.066
<i>My parents make me see a therapist,</i>
<i>and he's asking me dick questions.</i>

20:02.267 --> 20:04.497
<i>They made me stop eating foods</i>
<i>shaped like dicks.</i>

20:04.703 --> 20:06.330
<i>No hot dogs, no Popsicles.</i>

20:06.538 --> 20:09.405
You know how many foods are
shaped like dicks? The best kinds.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.041
Yeah.

20:11.843 --> 20:14.778
Well, I don't...
That's really messed up.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.808
- Super gay.
- All right, let's stop this madness.

20:18.016 --> 20:21.247
- Let's just go get some dessert.
- I can't, I gotta go meet my counselor.

20:21.453 --> 20:23.751
I'm picking out my classes
for next year.

20:24.756 --> 20:28.817
So I gotta sit and eat dessert alone,
like I'm fucking Steven Glanzberg?

20:29.561 --> 20:31.961
I gue... Yeah, I mean,
what do you want me to do?

20:33.031 --> 20:35.090
I don't know. Nothing. It's fine.

20:35.767 --> 20:39.533
- Just relax, man. I'll see you later.
- That's fine. I'll be fine.

20:46.845 --> 20:48.813
Hey, pussy.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.879
Fuck off.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.778
Just the one. Just the one. Not both.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.612
- So I'll call Andy and Greg.
- Okay.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.288
And I'll bring the '80s dance music.

20:57.489 --> 20:59.081
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right on.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.725
Seth! Hi. There you are.
We were just talking about you.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.122
- Here I am.
- That's weird.

21:04.329 --> 21:07.059
So you're coming to my party tonight?
Because it's fully on.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.326
Yeah, why? Should I not come?
Because I could think of other shit...

21:10.535 --> 21:13.026
Oh, no. No.
I want you to come, I just...

21:13.238 --> 21:16.469
You said something earlier about,
like, a fake ID or something, right?

21:16.675 --> 21:19.235
Yeah, I'm gonna get one.
For sure, for sure.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.174
I'm getting that for sure.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.913
Can you get us booze?

21:27.352 --> 21:29.684
Yeah. I can.
I can get you guys alcohol.

21:29.888 --> 21:31.412
- Really? Seriously?
- Yes, for sure.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.181
That would be awesome.
Thank you.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.860
Because we were worried about that.
That would be great.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.723
Plus, you know, you scratch
our backs, we'll scratch yours.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.955
Well, Jules, the funny thing
about my back...

21:41.166 --> 21:43.657
...is that it's located on my cock.

21:46.204 --> 21:48.172
So you do want alcohol?
You want some or no?

21:48.373 --> 21:50.568
You do or you don't?
You do want alcohol.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.107
- Yeah.
- Either way.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.302
- Well...
- Either way. Either way's fine.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.242
This is actually kind of a big favor.

21:56.448 --> 22:00.384
Because my parents left me like
100 bucks to feed myself for the week.

22:00.585 --> 22:03.782
But the house is full of food,
so I just thought I'd spend it all...

22:03.989 --> 22:06.787
...on, you know,
extra drinks for the party, so...

22:06.992 --> 22:10.120
That's really nice. I don't think
I've ever done anything that nice.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.853
- It's cool?
- Yeah.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.224
- Okay. Thank you.
- Awesome.

22:13.432 --> 22:16.401
I mean, seriously, that's really...
That's nice of you. Thank you.

22:16.601 --> 22:20.230
So should I just get a shitload
of different shit?

22:21.073 --> 22:23.371
Well, you gotta get me
some Kyle's Killer Lemonade.

22:23.575 --> 22:26.806
Kyle's Killer Lemonade. That's kind of
gay, but I can get it for you.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.247
So... Okay, so then
we will see you tonight.

22:30.449 --> 22:31.279
Go to the ball, guys.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.211
Evan. Get into the game.

22:34.786 --> 22:36.686
Kick it over to me.

22:36.888 --> 22:38.947
Seth! Get off the field!

22:39.157 --> 22:41.318
Get out of here.
They're gonna make me run laps.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.720
Just fucking listen, okay?

22:42.928 --> 22:46.386
Jules and her stupid fucking friend
asked me to buy her alcohol.

22:46.598 --> 22:49.533
But not just her, for her whole party.
You know what that means?

22:49.735 --> 22:52.898
By some miracle, we were paired up
and she actually thought of me.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.801
Thought of me enough to decide
I was the guy she would trust...

22:56.007 --> 22:58.805
...with the whole fun-ness of her party.
She wants to fuck me.

22:59.010 --> 23:01.843
She wants my dick
in or around her mouth.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.811
Did you think that maybe
she's using you to get her alcohol?

23:05.016 --> 23:07.541
- She doesn't want your dick.
- Of course I thought of that.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.744
The first thing that came
to my mind. Listen.

23:09.955 --> 23:12.048
My older brother always says
the nastiest shit.

23:12.257 --> 23:14.725
Like he called me "hymen"
until I was 12.

23:14.926 --> 23:16.416
Seth, I wanna blow you.

23:17.295 --> 23:18.557
She didn't say that. Come on.

23:18.764 --> 23:20.595
She didn't say the second part,
the first...

23:20.799 --> 23:23.199
She's got an older brother.
She could have asked him.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.994
She looked me in the eyes and said:

23:25.203 --> 23:28.934
"Seth, Mom is making a pubie salad.
I need some Seth's Own dressing."

23:29.141 --> 23:31.507
She's D.T.F.
She's down to fuck, man.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.372
P in vagi.
She wants to fuck, man.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.241
Tonight is the night
that fucking is an actual possibility.

23:37.449 --> 23:40.077
You sound like an idiot.
You're not gonna sleep with her.

23:40.285 --> 23:43.550
No. Dude, I know
I talk a lot of shit, okay?

23:43.755 --> 23:46.349
But she's gonna be at the party
and she's gonna be drunk.

23:46.558 --> 23:49.959
She likes me at least a little.
At the very least, I'll make out with her.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.153
Two weeks, handjob.
Month, blowjob. Whatever.

23:52.364 --> 23:53.922
And then I make her my girlfriend.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.100
And I've got, like,
two solid months of sex.

23:56.301 --> 23:57.893
By the time college rolls around...

23:58.103 --> 24:00.367
...l'll be like the Iron Chef
of pounding vag.

24:00.572 --> 24:01.869
Can we talk about this later?

24:02.073 --> 24:04.007
What the fuck, Evan?
We're down two points.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.040
Fucking calm down, Greg.
It's soccer.

24:06.244 --> 24:07.836
- It's soccer.
- Fuck you, man.

24:08.046 --> 24:10.276
Hey, Greg, why don't you go
piss your pants again?

24:10.482 --> 24:13.007
- That was eight years ago, asshole.
- People don't forget.

24:13.218 --> 24:15.277
Do you wanna hear the best part?
Becca.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.284
You do the same thing with her.

24:17.489 --> 24:19.582
When you guys are shitfaced,
you get with her.

24:19.791 --> 24:22.555
This is our last party
as high school people.

24:22.761 --> 24:25.628
I've ignored my hatred for Becca
in coming up with this plan.

24:25.831 --> 24:28.595
I'm flexing nuts. Just fucking
come with me on this voyage...

24:28.800 --> 24:30.358
...and stop being a pussy
for once...

24:30.569 --> 24:33.595
...and we can fucking
fuck some girls already.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.504
- I should buy Becca alcohol?
- Yeah, it'll be pimp.

24:36.708 --> 24:39.575
That way you know she'll be drunk.
You know when girls say:

24:39.778 --> 24:42.941
"I was so shitfaced last night.
I shouldn't have fucked that guy."

24:43.148 --> 24:44.513
We could be that mistake!

24:46.818 --> 24:48.080
Have you talked to Fogell?

24:48.286 --> 24:51.187
All right, you talk to Becca.
I'll talk to that retard, Fogell.

24:51.389 --> 24:52.356
Don't worry.

24:52.557 --> 24:55.492
- Seth, get off the field!
- Goal.

24:55.694 --> 24:57.423
- You're getting that!
- No, I'm not!

25:01.399 --> 25:03.264
Hey, Becca. Hey, hold up.

25:03.468 --> 25:04.435
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

25:04.636 --> 25:07.036
Hi. Did you hear
about the party tonight?

25:07.239 --> 25:09.207
Yeah. Yeah, I just heard.
It sounds awesome.

25:09.407 --> 25:11.375
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.

25:11.576 --> 25:12.907
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.

25:13.111 --> 25:14.669
That's why I came looking for you.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.041
Me and the guys are gonna
go to a liquor store.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.773
And I just thought, you know...

25:18.984 --> 25:21.646
...if you needed someone
to get you yours, I could do that.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.377
I could be that person.

25:23.588 --> 25:24.816
Yeah.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.513
Yeah, no, that would be great.

25:26.725 --> 25:30.058
That would save me such a hassle,
because I was gonna beg my sister.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.628
Could you get me, like,
a bottle of Goldslick Vodka?

25:32.831 --> 25:35.425
Yeah. That's the one
with the little golden flakes in it?

25:35.634 --> 25:38.296
- Yeah. The girly one.
- That's classy.

25:38.503 --> 25:40.232
Well, I'll pay you back at the party.

25:40.438 --> 25:42.167
No, you won't.
No, it's my treat, miss.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.636
- Really?
- Yep. That's that.

25:43.842 --> 25:46.709
It's the first of many too,
so get used to it, sister.

25:46.912 --> 25:49.107
Well, thank you.

25:49.314 --> 25:51.145
Yeah, no problem.

25:58.123 --> 26:00.353
- I'm sorry. It was an accident.
- It's okay.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.153
I was gonna give you a nudge...
A punch, the friend thing.

26:03.361 --> 26:04.385
I didn't mean...

26:04.596 --> 26:06.029
- Hey, Becca.
- Hey.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.255
- Hey.
- Gaby.

26:07.465 --> 26:08.659
- What's up, Evan?
- Hey, Gaby.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.698
- We should get to class.
- We're gonna go.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.460
- So I will see you tonight.
- Okay.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.229
- Really, don't worry.
- Okay. Sorry.

26:14.439 --> 26:16.498
- Bye.
- Sorry.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.039
Bye.

26:19.544 --> 26:21.171
Sorry.

26:29.020 --> 26:31.420
Where's that sack of shit, Fogell?
He said he'd be here.

26:31.623 --> 26:33.056
I'm here with my thumb up my ass.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.249
I did it, dude.
I even offered to pay for it.

26:35.460 --> 26:37.325
It was pimp.
I feel like a pimp right now.

26:37.529 --> 26:40.157
- Like one of those pimps.
- That is fucking pimp.

26:40.365 --> 26:43.528
- That's what I was afraid of.
- Why didn't I think of that? Shit.

26:45.804 --> 26:47.101
Sh... We're screwed.

26:47.305 --> 26:48.567
- Okay? We're screwed.
- Okay.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.798
This is what we get
for trusting Fogell, okay?

26:51.009 --> 26:53.170
He pussied out.
I know he pussied out.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.580
What are you making?

26:56.114 --> 27:00.517
I'm just drilling holes.
The last two weeks. Fuck it.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.477
What do we tell the girls,
we couldn't do the one thing...

27:03.688 --> 27:05.849
...we promised because
we're dickless incompetents?

27:06.057 --> 27:09.151
Now we're never gonna bone
because of that used tampon, Fogell.

27:09.361 --> 27:13.058
How'd he get into Dartmouth?
I don't get it. He's got shit for brains.

27:13.264 --> 27:15.164
All right,
how else can we get alcohol?

27:15.367 --> 27:18.097
- Yo, guys! What's up?
- Fogell, where have you been, man?

27:18.303 --> 27:20.168
You almost gave me
a goddamn heart attack.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.569
- Let me see it. Did you pussy out?
- No, no, man. I got it.

27:23.775 --> 27:25.834
It's flawless. Check it.

27:26.044 --> 27:27.238
Hawaii?

27:27.445 --> 27:30.073
All right, that's good.
It's hard to trace, I guess.

27:30.281 --> 27:33.648
Wait, you changed your name
to McLovin?

27:34.185 --> 27:36.483
- Yeah.
- McLovin?

27:37.555 --> 27:40.649
What kind of a stupid name is that?
Are you an Irish R & B singer?

27:40.859 --> 27:43.191
They let you pick any name you want
when you're there.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.987
And you landed on McLovin?

27:45.196 --> 27:47.357
Yeah, it was between that
or Mohammad.

27:47.565 --> 27:49.726
Why the fuck would it be
between that or Mohammad?

27:49.934 --> 27:51.925
Why not just pick
a common name?

27:52.137 --> 27:55.265
Mohammad is the most common name
on earth. Read a fucking book.

27:55.473 --> 27:57.270
Have you ever met anyone
named Mohammad?

27:57.475 --> 27:59.272
Have you ever met anyone
named McLovin?

27:59.477 --> 28:01.570
No, that's why you picked
a dumb fucking name.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.042
- Fuck you.
- Give me that.

28:03.248 --> 28:06.649
All right. You look like a future
pedophile in this picture, number one.

28:06.851 --> 28:09.945
Number two, it doesn't even have
a first name. It just says McLovin!

28:10.155 --> 28:11.247
What? One name?

28:11.456 --> 28:14.016
One name? Who are you, Seal?

28:14.225 --> 28:16.523
Fogell, this ID says
you're 25 years old.

28:16.728 --> 28:18.286
Why wouldn't you just put 21, man?

28:18.496 --> 28:20.521
Seth, Seth, Seth.
Listen up, ass-face.

28:20.732 --> 28:24.224
Every day, hundreds of kids go into
the liquor store with their fake IDs...

28:24.436 --> 28:26.233
...and every single one
says they're 21.

28:26.438 --> 28:28.167
How many 21 -year-olds
are in this town?

28:28.373 --> 28:29.772
It's called fucking strategy.

28:29.974 --> 28:32.135
Let's stay calm, okay?
Let's not lose our heads.

28:32.343 --> 28:35.471
It's a fine ID. It'll... It's gonna work.
It's passable, okay?

28:35.680 --> 28:38.205
This isn't terrible.
I mean, it's up to you, Fogell.

28:38.416 --> 28:40.941
This guy's gonna think,
"Here's a kid with a fake ID"...

28:41.152 --> 28:45.384
...or "Here's McLovin, the 25-year-old
Hawaiian organ donor."

28:45.590 --> 28:47.751
Okay? So, what's it gonna be?

28:48.293 --> 28:49.783
I am McLovin.

28:50.795 --> 28:53.457
No, you're not. No one's McLovin.
McLovin's never existed...

28:53.665 --> 28:57.032
...because that's a made-up, dumb,
fucking fairy-tale name, you fuck!

28:57.235 --> 28:59.567
Jeez, man. It'll work.
Give it a chance.

28:59.771 --> 29:01.136
Did you move my...?

29:01.339 --> 29:02.601
Where is my car?

29:02.807 --> 29:04.206
Oh, my God, man.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.775
What did I say to you?
I told you not to park here.

29:06.978 --> 29:09.378
Why would you park
in the staff parking lot?

29:09.581 --> 29:10.878
Shut the fuck up, Fogell.

29:11.082 --> 29:13.642
I mean, because you're not staff.

29:13.852 --> 29:17.379
I know that, Fagell! I know that!

29:19.791 --> 29:21.656
Evan, let's go to your house.

29:22.794 --> 29:25.422
Wait, are you guys
still picking me up from work?

29:26.831 --> 29:28.423
Can you answer me?

29:32.237 --> 29:34.967
Man, don't you have
any non-infant clothes?

29:36.040 --> 29:37.007
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.369
Why don't you just wear
what you wore to school?

29:39.577 --> 29:42.637
I can't do that. I can't let Jules
see me in what I wore to school.

29:42.847 --> 29:44.280
It's completely unbecoming.

29:44.482 --> 29:47.883
No one's gotten a handjob
in cargo shorts since Nam.

29:48.086 --> 29:50.953
I have to kill these guys.
You don't negotiate with terrorists.

29:51.156 --> 29:53.989
Really? Yeah, that's what
we should be talking about right now.

29:54.192 --> 29:56.660
Then why don't you go
and get some of your own clothes?

29:56.861 --> 29:58.226
That's the dumbest thing ever.

29:58.429 --> 30:01.557
My parents will see that my car's
been towed and I'll be grounded.

30:01.766 --> 30:03.893
These fucking terrorists
multiply like bunnies.

30:04.102 --> 30:05.399
Where did I leave the M16?

30:05.603 --> 30:09.004
Do you have any bigger clothes
or do you only shop at babyGap?

30:09.207 --> 30:11.437
Fuck me. I can't...

30:12.010 --> 30:14.240
That's fun.
Why do they make that?

30:14.445 --> 30:17.505
If you can't even win,
then why am I fucking playing?

30:17.715 --> 30:19.478
Do you wanna go see
what my dad has?

30:43.308 --> 30:45.071
<i>What the fuck?</i>

30:48.613 --> 30:49.705
What the hell is that?

30:49.914 --> 30:51.848
It's a fucking vest, dumbass.

30:52.050 --> 30:54.518
- I'm trying to look older.
- You look like Pinocchio.

30:54.719 --> 30:57.210
- It's just a vest.
- They got a lot of booze in there.

30:57.422 --> 31:00.391
If we get it now, we can get
to the party faster with Jules' shit.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.787
No way, man. I work there.
They know I'm not 25.

31:02.994 --> 31:05.019
Nobody said anything about you,
dick-mouth.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.255
You really fucked me on this one.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.262
So now I'm gonna steal the booze.

31:09.467 --> 31:12.231
Don't do this.
I promise you I'll get the liquor later.

31:12.437 --> 31:14.735
Mike Snider's ID always works.
So will mine, man.

31:14.939 --> 31:18.375
Mike Snider's ID doesn't have
one fucking name on it! Okay?

31:18.576 --> 31:22.171
I thought you Dartmouth guys would
be smart enough to understand that.

31:22.680 --> 31:25.046
Now Seth's gotta
pick up all the pieces.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.911
He won't do it. Don't worry.

31:27.118 --> 31:30.315
I forgot to tell you, my mom said we
can have the TV from the basement...

31:30.521 --> 31:32.216
Shut the fuck up,
he's gonna hear you.

31:32.423 --> 31:34.220
Just be quiet.
Wait until he goes away.

31:34.425 --> 31:36.985
You still haven't told him
that we're rooming together?

31:37.195 --> 31:38.628
Fogell, shut the fuck up.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.923
And take off your vest.
You look like Aladdin.

31:41.132 --> 31:43.828
Okay. You got it.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.602
Hope piggy can run.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.352
How old are you?

32:12.563 --> 32:14.121
Twenty-two.

32:14.632 --> 32:17.260
You certainly are.
That'll be 80 dollars.

32:17.835 --> 32:19.564
Okay.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.069
Thank you kindly. Will that do?

32:22.273 --> 32:24.468
Certainly will. Thank you, Seth.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.644
Hey, thank you.

32:37.255 --> 32:38.688
You dropped your purse, ma'am.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.323
Would you like some help?

32:40.525 --> 32:42.720
Well, that would be lovely,
young man.

32:42.927 --> 32:46.021
Would you like me
to buy you alcohol?

32:46.531 --> 32:48.522
That would be lovely.

32:48.733 --> 32:51.293
- Enjoy your remaining years.
- I will.

32:51.502 --> 32:54.801
- Enjoy fucking Jules.
- I will.

33:13.091 --> 33:14.752
Don't do it, kid.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.898
I never had a choice.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.871
You fucking killed her!

33:31.943 --> 33:32.910
No!

33:43.254 --> 33:46.223
Where's all the stolen liquor?
Did you hide it up your butt?

33:46.424 --> 33:49.222
Piss off! I was gonna do it,
but there was a security breach.

33:49.427 --> 33:50.655
You never would've done it.

33:50.862 --> 33:54.093
Let's go to a liquor store
and watch your stupid ID get rejected.

33:54.298 --> 33:56.732
Wait, I'm gonna go put my vest
back in my locker.

34:23.828 --> 34:25.455
All right. Here we are. This is it.

34:25.663 --> 34:26.960
- You ready? Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:28.199 --> 34:31.565
- Here's the money and the list.
- Change is yours. Keep the change.

34:31.768 --> 34:34.829
- Thank you. What's the list for?
- The alcohol.

34:35.039 --> 34:37.940
We're gonna get alcohol
for the whole party, okay?

34:38.141 --> 34:40.804
We put a lot of time into this list,
so don't fuck it up.

34:41.012 --> 34:41.978
It's perfect.

34:42.179 --> 34:45.513
Ouzo, bourbon,
spiced rum, Goldslick...

34:45.716 --> 34:48.184
Goldslick Vodka. That's for Becca.
Don't forget that.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.119
Raspberry vodka, Scotch...

34:51.322 --> 34:53.085
And Kyle's Killer Lemonade.
A six-pack.

34:53.291 --> 34:56.192
This is a lot. I don't know
if I can get away with all this.

34:56.393 --> 34:57.793
What difference does it make?

34:57.995 --> 35:01.362
I don't know, man.
I'm, like, really nervous.

35:01.966 --> 35:04.434
- Are you okay?
- No, man. I should have wore the vest.

35:04.635 --> 35:06.967
- Calm down.
- What the fuck are you doing?

35:07.171 --> 35:09.036
What if I go in
and they turn me down, man?

35:09.240 --> 35:11.105
Then we're in the same place
we're in now.

35:11.309 --> 35:13.004
- Who cares?
- It's fucking humiliating!

35:13.211 --> 35:15.008
Everybody sees them
kicking me out.

35:15.213 --> 35:18.307
What if they make me
put the liquor back? I can't do that.

35:18.516 --> 35:20.882
This whole thing
is bigger than you, Fogell!

35:21.085 --> 35:24.452
So grow a pair of nuts and fucking
walk in there and buy the alcohol!

35:24.989 --> 35:27.184
What if I don't feel like it
anymore, Seth? What?

35:27.391 --> 35:29.188
Then I'll fucking kill you, okay?

35:29.393 --> 35:31.361
I'll stab you
through your fucking heart.

35:31.562 --> 35:33.052
No, you can do this, man.
Come on.

35:33.264 --> 35:36.131
Killing me won't get you alcohol.
I'm the one with the fake ID.

35:36.334 --> 35:38.325
Then I'll cut
your dumb fucking face off...

35:38.536 --> 35:41.630
...throw it over mine and get your ID
and buy it my fucking self!

35:41.839 --> 35:44.706
Oh, really? You don't have
the technology or the steady hands...

35:44.909 --> 35:46.877
...to pull off a procedure like that,
so ha!

35:47.078 --> 35:48.568
Peace.

35:49.213 --> 35:51.738
Fogell, just be cool, man.
Get in and get out.

35:51.949 --> 35:52.916
You're the hero.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.187
Sorry.

36:27.318 --> 36:28.945
Is there a problem here, sir?

36:29.153 --> 36:32.486
No. No problem whatsoever.

36:35.693 --> 36:38.355
Sir, did you do this? On the floor?

36:38.563 --> 36:40.030
No.

36:40.231 --> 36:41.858
And you should really clean this up.

36:42.066 --> 36:44.227
Someone could really
hurt themselves.

36:46.003 --> 36:47.868
Fuck my life.

36:48.472 --> 36:49.905
We're so fucked.
We're so fucked.

36:50.107 --> 36:51.938
This plan's been fucked
since Jump Street.

36:52.143 --> 36:54.737
Okay, just calm down.
Just calm down, all right?

36:55.279 --> 36:58.009
Hey, so did you bring a condom
for tonight?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.150
You brought a condom with you?

37:00.351 --> 37:02.216
Yeah. I figured
I might as well, you know?

37:02.420 --> 37:04.945
I brought a little bottle
of spermicidal lube too.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.322
You laughed in my face
when I said I'd be having sex tonight.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.826
That doesn't mean
you shouldn't always be prepared.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.328
- You didn't even bring a condom?
- No.

37:15.533 --> 37:17.330
No, Evan,
that wasn't part of the plan.

37:17.535 --> 37:19.560
You did this
without consulting with me.

37:19.770 --> 37:23.433
We've never discussed, like, any plan,
but you keep saying we have a plan.

37:23.641 --> 37:26.576
I had, like, a general outline.
You know?

37:26.777 --> 37:29.575
I was gonna go down on her
for, like, several hours, okay?

37:29.780 --> 37:32.681
She would love that. She'd be smitten.
She'd go out with that.

37:32.883 --> 37:34.578
Or I dry hump the shit out of her leg.

37:34.785 --> 37:37.811
Well, I just... I don't see the harm
in bringing one little condom.

37:38.022 --> 37:40.149
And one little bottle
of spermicidal lube?

37:40.358 --> 37:42.792
Yeah, one little bottle
of spermicidal lube.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.792
- Evan, that's psycho shit, man.
- No, it's not.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.624
That's, like, Charles Manson shit.

37:47.832 --> 37:50.926
What, do you think Becca's gonna be
psyched that you brought lube?

37:51.135 --> 37:54.536
"Oh, Evan. Thank you for bringing
that lube for my pussy.

37:54.739 --> 37:57.833
I never would've been able to handle
your fucking 4-inch dick...

37:58.042 --> 38:01.136
...inside my pussy
without that gigantic bottle of lube."

38:01.345 --> 38:02.972
- Okay, that's... That's enough.
- Fuck.

38:03.180 --> 38:05.808
These girls are 18,
they're not dried-up old ladies.

38:06.017 --> 38:08.008
- They're good to go.
- Then I won't bring the lube.

38:08.219 --> 38:11.188
Don't make me feel like that.
I thought it was cool.

38:11.389 --> 38:13.687
- This is a nice kind.
- Let me see that for a second.

38:13.891 --> 38:15.882
- An impressive kind.
- It is kind of cool.

38:16.093 --> 38:17.788
- That's cool.
- Fucking dumbass. Lube?

38:17.995 --> 38:19.360
- That's funny.
- You brought lube?

38:19.563 --> 38:22.794
You owe me 6 bucks because I'm not
walking over to get it and it exploded.

38:24.502 --> 38:26.697
Hello, Mindy.

38:39.417 --> 38:41.977
I love that stuff.
Been drinking it for years.

38:43.387 --> 38:47.721
You know, I heard they recently
decided to add more hops to it.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.190
Okay.

38:53.397 --> 38:55.888
I'm gonna need to see
some identification.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.366
Really?

38:59.570 --> 39:01.800
Makes me feel young again.
There you go.

39:04.475 --> 39:06.670
Oh, shit, it's Cary Hutchins.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.315
She had the biggest tits
I've ever seen.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.346
I heard she got
breast-reduction surgery.

39:13.551 --> 39:15.212
What? Making your tits smaller?

39:15.419 --> 39:18.479
That's like slapping God
for giving you a gorgeous gift.

39:18.689 --> 39:19.951
She had back problems, man.

39:20.157 --> 39:23.251
And it's not just making them smaller.
They completely reshape them.

39:23.461 --> 39:25.395
They make them
more supple and symmetrical.

39:26.163 --> 39:28.063
I gotta catch a glimpse
of these warlocks.

39:28.265 --> 39:29.823
Let's make a move.

39:31.402 --> 39:33.233
- She's going around the corner.
- Come on!

39:39.643 --> 39:42.578
Okay. Your total is 96.59.

39:52.523 --> 39:53.785
I don't believe it!

39:54.725 --> 39:56.750
Are you okay, mister?

39:57.561 --> 39:59.688
What the shit was that?

40:01.232 --> 40:04.258
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

40:05.770 --> 40:07.101
I don't believe it.

40:07.304 --> 40:09.670
I don't know, man.
I think she looked better before.

40:09.874 --> 40:13.275
But now that she can jog comfortably,
she's in the best shape she's ever...

40:16.647 --> 40:18.410
What is this? What's that?

40:21.152 --> 40:22.414
Oh, man.

40:27.658 --> 40:29.216
Holy shit, they busted Fogell.

40:30.327 --> 40:32.227
How did this happen, Evan?
Fuck, man!

40:32.430 --> 40:33.920
His dad's gonna fucking kill him.

40:34.131 --> 40:35.291
Look, okay?

40:35.499 --> 40:38.900
He assaulted the customer,
grabbed the cash and ran out.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.070
So...

40:40.271 --> 40:41.898
- How...?
- How...? How...? How...?

40:42.106 --> 40:45.507
- Say when, height-wise.
- I'm gonna start up here, tell me when.

40:45.709 --> 40:47.939
- I'll start on the bottom and...
- When.

40:48.145 --> 40:50.170
Whatever 5'10" is,
he was 5'10".

40:50.381 --> 40:53.043
Ethnically, I mean, did... What...?

40:54.251 --> 40:58.813
I mean, was he...?
Was he like us, or...?

41:00.191 --> 41:01.488
A woman?

41:01.692 --> 41:02.716
- Female?
- No.

41:02.927 --> 41:05.418
- Is that what you're asking?
- No, no. Was he...?

41:05.629 --> 41:06.596
- Like...
- What? What?

41:06.797 --> 41:07.764
- African?
- Af... Af...

41:07.965 --> 41:09.489
- Was he African?
- African.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.759
No. He was American,
and he was like you.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.836
- He looked just like you.
- He was Jewish. Okay, Jew.

41:15.039 --> 41:17.530
- It's an odd crime for a Jew.
- They're pretty docile.

41:17.741 --> 41:21.336
Okay, so we have an African Jew
wearing a hoodie.

41:21.545 --> 41:25.072
No, you don't. No. That's not what
I said. Is that what you heard me say?

41:25.282 --> 41:28.080
I said he looked like you.
Do you look like an African Jew?

41:28.953 --> 41:31.114
- No, I look like a cop.
- Yeah.

41:32.456 --> 41:34.651
He was Caucasian.

41:34.859 --> 41:36.622
- Caucasian.
- All right.

41:36.827 --> 41:37.794
- Okay.
- Well, touché.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.327
Kind of looked like Eminem.
Does that help you?

41:40.531 --> 41:41.498
- An M&M.
- An M&M.

41:41.699 --> 41:44.395
- So he was circular...?
- Marshall Mathers. Eminem?

41:44.602 --> 41:47.799
- The rapper, Eminem.
- Did he look like this?

41:48.339 --> 41:50.830
- I'm an amateur. I kind of...
- That looks like an M&M.

41:51.041 --> 41:55.410
Longer face? Bigger nose?
Would you say his mouth was wider?

41:55.613 --> 41:56.978
Open? A gap?

41:57.181 --> 42:02.016
Is there another squad car in the area
that could be of further assistance?

42:02.219 --> 42:03.846
I don't seem to be getting any.

42:04.054 --> 42:06.955
Okay, so just walk me through again
what this guy did.

42:07.157 --> 42:10.217
He... He... He came in, he's wielding...

42:10.427 --> 42:14.693
He's wielding something. He hits
this small gentleman in the slacks.

42:14.899 --> 42:17.925
And then he jumps over you,
he feels you up, violates you.

42:18.135 --> 42:19.796
- I did not say that.
- No, he doesn't.

42:20.004 --> 42:23.633
Look, I can't do this. I told you already,
I have an exam tomorrow.

42:23.841 --> 42:27.174
Can you understand that?
I have a goddamn veterinary exam!

42:28.746 --> 42:30.509
Goddamn it. This is bullshit.

42:30.714 --> 42:33.444
This is some bullshit.
I got an exam tomorrow. Forget this.

42:33.651 --> 42:35.516
Well, apparently someone
has an exam.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.380
How'd you know?

42:38.255 --> 42:39.882
You. You're the one
that got punched?

42:40.090 --> 42:41.717
- Yeah.
- Okay.

42:41.926 --> 42:44.292
First things first.
What is your name?

42:48.165 --> 42:49.894
My name?

42:50.100 --> 42:53.900
It's M... McLov... McLovin.

42:54.505 --> 42:55.972
McLovin?

42:56.173 --> 42:57.538
Yeah.

42:58.609 --> 43:00.099
Now, what's your first name?

43:00.311 --> 43:01.505
What?

43:01.712 --> 43:03.543
- Your first name?
- My first name?

43:04.815 --> 43:09.479
Technically I don't have a first name,
so don't worry about my first name.

43:10.554 --> 43:12.715
But we're the police.

43:12.923 --> 43:14.754
We just wanna get
the story straight.

43:16.293 --> 43:17.453
- Come on.
- Fuck, man.

43:17.661 --> 43:20.061
- Come on!
- He must be so afraid.

43:20.264 --> 43:23.233
I don't believe this bullshit.
I can't believe this is happening!

43:23.434 --> 43:26.926
I didn't know you could get arrested
for this shit. We need that liquor.

43:27.137 --> 43:29.765
- Are they gonna take him downtown?
- Fuck Fogell.

43:29.974 --> 43:31.805
He got arrested, okay?
We're on our own.

43:32.009 --> 43:33.533
We need a new way to get liq...

43:33.744 --> 43:37.339
Fuck! The money, man! Fuck!
How much money can you get?

43:37.548 --> 43:39.709
Why are you talking about money?
What about Fogell?

43:39.917 --> 43:43.580
That doesn't matter anymore. I lost
a hundred dollars of Jules' money.

43:43.787 --> 43:47.348
Are we gonna bust him out of jail?
Bake a cake with a fucking file in it?

43:47.558 --> 43:51.619
Fuck Fogell. We need a new way to
get liquor, which is fucking impossible.

43:51.829 --> 43:54.730
All right, you need to calm down.
We need to think for a second.

43:54.932 --> 43:57.696
- We need to think this out.
- Fuck thinking, we need to act!

44:00.037 --> 44:01.265
Seth!

44:01.472 --> 44:04.305
- What the fuck happened?
- Just... Just get up. Slowly.

44:04.508 --> 44:07.272
You all right? You okay?

44:07.478 --> 44:10.413
I am so sorry, man. I am so sorry.

44:10.614 --> 44:14.607
I didn't even effing see you at all, man.
Are you okay?

44:14.818 --> 44:18.219
So it's just McLovin?

44:18.422 --> 44:19.980
Yeah.

44:20.758 --> 44:22.953
- That's badass.
- That is badass.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.388
- Really cool.
- A badass name.

44:24.595 --> 44:27.291
- Lot of people with weird names.
- Chingy. Shakira.

44:27.498 --> 44:28.931
Rafe. Pax.

44:29.133 --> 44:32.261
We arrested a man-lady
who was legally named "Fuck."

44:32.469 --> 44:34.334
Think he was Vietnamese,
it was with a P-H.

44:34.538 --> 44:36.506
But it's still shocking
to see on a license.

44:36.707 --> 44:40.234
- Okay, and how old are you, McLovin?
- Old enough.

44:41.645 --> 44:43.112
Old enough for what?

44:45.582 --> 44:47.482
To party.

44:51.822 --> 44:53.687
Can I see your ID?

44:54.258 --> 44:56.317
Yeah, I think I have it.

45:20.851 --> 45:24.014
- You're an organ donor.
- What?

45:24.221 --> 45:25.916
I didn't wanna, but my wife insisted.

45:26.123 --> 45:27.886
I give him shit for it too. All the time.

45:28.092 --> 45:31.118
I say, "It's just like a woman.
Even after you're dead...

45:31.328 --> 45:34.388
...they wanna tear your heart out."
- They wanna tear your...

45:34.598 --> 45:37.362
- I say it weekly and it's still funny.
- It still makes me laugh.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.001
- Really funny.
- There you go.

45:39.203 --> 45:42.297
I'm sorry, guys.
I don't really have any information.

45:42.506 --> 45:45.066
He just hit me,
and I didn't see what he looked like.

45:45.275 --> 45:47.641
- I don't know if I can help you.
- You in a hurry?

45:47.845 --> 45:49.870
Yeah, kind of had to catch that bus.

45:50.080 --> 45:53.777
- Where were you headed?
- Near 13th and Granville.

45:54.585 --> 45:57.383
- We can take you there.
- Get your information on the way.

45:57.588 --> 45:59.852
- Why waste 2 bucks?
- We'll take you. No problem.

46:00.057 --> 46:03.686
Please don't report me, man.
We can figure this out, right?

46:03.894 --> 46:06.488
Why the fuck wouldn't I report you?
You just hit me.

46:08.532 --> 46:10.523
Because I'll do anything.

46:10.734 --> 46:13.225
Please, okay? Anything.
Like, literally...

46:13.437 --> 46:14.870
...fucking anything.

46:15.072 --> 46:18.667
Name anything. Name it. Name it.

46:19.743 --> 46:22.507
All right, look. Hey, man. All right.

46:22.713 --> 46:24.146
Listen, you can trust me, okay?

46:24.815 --> 46:27.579
I'm gonna be totally honest with you.

46:29.019 --> 46:31.419
I have a warrant out
for a totally nonviolent crime.

46:31.622 --> 46:35.353
Okay? There. Mercy Street, guys.

46:35.559 --> 46:37.254
I'll be honest with you for a second.

46:37.461 --> 46:39.691
You better get us a shitload of cash
or a shitload of alcohol...

46:39.897 --> 46:41.558
...or you're going to fucking prison.

46:41.765 --> 46:43.858
What are you doing, man?
You don't need to...

46:44.067 --> 46:46.035
No, let's not...
Let's hang on a second here.

46:46.236 --> 46:47.294
- Cough it up.
- Fine.

46:47.504 --> 46:49.335
Don't know if we should be
doing anything official.

46:49.573 --> 46:52.474
We're working together. It's like
<i>Let's Make a Deal</i>. Here we go.

46:53.377 --> 46:54.776
Seven bucks?

46:54.978 --> 46:58.038
Are you fucking serious? This isn't
enough. What are you, a 6-year-old?

46:58.315 --> 47:01.944
- It's all I have, man. It's all I have.
- You better think of something quickly.

47:02.152 --> 47:06.111
- My back! My back. Cops, my back.
- No, no, no. Wait, don't do that.

47:06.323 --> 47:08.587
All right, listen.
I can get you alcohol.

47:08.792 --> 47:10.953
I'm going over to this party
right now, bro. Okay?

47:11.161 --> 47:15.097
It's got booze, it's got girls.
Booze and girls equals...

47:15.299 --> 47:17.494
I don't know. Do you?
I don't know. Do you?

47:17.701 --> 47:20.636
- I think you do. Do you?
- Yes. That's a definite yes.

47:20.838 --> 47:21.805
Definite yes, then.

47:22.005 --> 47:24.337
- Give me one sec to talk to him.
- Stay right here.

47:24.541 --> 47:27.840
Yeah, yeah. Do what you gotta do.
Mix it over. I'll be over by the car.

47:28.045 --> 47:31.014
Just talk it out. Hey, I'm a nice guy.

47:31.815 --> 47:33.942
- Come on, it's great.
- What are you thinking?

47:34.151 --> 47:35.618
- What are you doing?
- What?

47:35.819 --> 47:38.219
I lost Jules' money,
Fogell's dead to us now...

47:38.422 --> 47:40.014
...we don't have any choice.
Let's go.

47:40.224 --> 47:43.193
I don't like this idea. This guy's
fucking creepy, man. Look at him.

47:43.393 --> 47:46.157
What? He looks like a guy.
That's what guys look like.

47:46.363 --> 47:48.991
- What is your problem?
- You guys know a guy named Jimmy?

47:49.199 --> 47:51.429
You totally look like his brother.

47:51.635 --> 47:54.069
You totally
look like his brother, man.

47:54.271 --> 47:55.829
You do.

47:57.541 --> 47:59.338
You promised Becca
you'd get her alcohol.

47:59.543 --> 48:01.511
If you don't, she's gonna have
a shitty night.

48:01.712 --> 48:03.680
That's all I'm saying. Come on.

48:04.481 --> 48:06.449
We bingo, bango, ready to go, go?

48:07.050 --> 48:09.575
- Good luck on your exam tomorrow.
- Good luck on your exam.

48:09.786 --> 48:12.687
- You don't wanna ride the bus.
- Buses smell like piss, generally.

48:12.890 --> 48:13.857
- You know why?
- Why?

48:14.057 --> 48:15.649
People piss on them.

48:21.798 --> 48:26.758
You know, one of you bros could've
come up and sat up with me.

48:26.970 --> 48:28.665
- We're fine back here.
- Back's fine.

48:28.872 --> 48:30.806
Safe in the back seat.

48:34.278 --> 48:35.336
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

48:36.713 --> 48:39.307
- Hey, Jules.
- Who is it? Who's on the phone?

48:39.516 --> 48:40.983
Seth. Hey, where are you?

48:41.184 --> 48:44.642
I'm in a cab right now,
on the way to a liquor store.

48:44.855 --> 48:46.652
Good. I can't wait
for you to get here.

48:46.857 --> 48:49.382
Well, I hope your friends
are ready to get fucked up.

48:50.994 --> 48:52.222
<i>I'm sure they will be.</i>

48:52.429 --> 48:54.624
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- <i>Peace.</i>

48:55.599 --> 48:57.396
Oh, man! Dude, this is crazy.

48:57.601 --> 49:00.331
She called, she said,
"I can't wait for you to get there."

49:00.537 --> 49:03.472
That sounds like
she fully wants it, man! Oh, yeah!

49:03.674 --> 49:08.168
Who's gonna give it to her, huh,
my man? You, that's who.

49:08.378 --> 49:10.573
Man.

49:10.948 --> 49:12.609
You guys on MySpace, or...?

49:25.696 --> 49:29.723
Officers? I can answer those
questions now if you want me to.

49:29.933 --> 49:32.959
We get the gist of it. You were
buying beer, some guys punched you.

49:33.170 --> 49:35.365
Don't worry about it.
We're not gonna find them.

49:35.572 --> 49:38.132
- Case closed.
- But it was only...

49:49.519 --> 49:53.011
- But it was only one guy.
- Only one guy? Shit.

49:53.223 --> 49:54.815
How am I supposed to
find one guy?

49:55.025 --> 49:58.461
This job really isn't how, you know,
shows like <i>CSI</i> make it out to be.

49:58.662 --> 50:02.291
When I first joined the force, I assumed
there was semen on everything...

50:02.499 --> 50:04.967
...and there was some, like,
huge semen database...

50:05.168 --> 50:08.331
...that had every bad guy's semen in it.
There isn't. That doesn't exist.

50:08.538 --> 50:11.336
I often go to sleep and dream of
waking up in a world where...

50:11.541 --> 50:13.975
...everything's covered in semen.
- I mean, who doesn't?

50:14.177 --> 50:16.145
It'd be nice.
Like that crime scene today.

50:16.346 --> 50:18.780
If the man had ejaculated
and then punched you...

50:18.982 --> 50:20.609
...we'd have a shot at catching him.

50:20.817 --> 50:23.047
- No way.
- Just punched in the face, no semen.

50:23.253 --> 50:25.744
- No semen.
- Story of my life.

50:30.961 --> 50:34.761
Michaels here, he's six months in.

50:35.599 --> 50:37.999
He's young,
but the Force is strong with this one.

50:38.201 --> 50:40.601
Learning you are, young padawan.

50:40.804 --> 50:42.396
Thank you very much.

50:43.673 --> 50:46.039
- That's Yoda.
- Are you familiar with Yoda?

50:46.243 --> 50:47.733
From <i>Attack of the Clones?</i>

50:47.944 --> 50:52.005
<i>We have a 245 at East 24 and</i>
<i>Montgomery, Bailey's Bar and Grill.</i>

50:52.215 --> 50:54.183
Car 98 on it.

50:54.384 --> 50:57.319
See, Michaels, you always
take a call at a bar because...

50:57.521 --> 50:59.580
...better or worse,
you get a beer out of it.

51:00.524 --> 51:01.582
Pretty sweet, huh?

51:01.792 --> 51:03.885
- True that. Amazing thinking.
- Hey, McLovin.

51:04.094 --> 51:07.154
We got a situation at Bailey's,
so we'll drop you off after, all right?

51:07.364 --> 51:09.389
Actually, I kind of
have to be somewhere...

51:09.599 --> 51:12.659
- Sweet. Sit tight.
- Set course for Bailey's, warp 10.

51:12.869 --> 51:14.200
Engage.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.138
Yeah.

51:21.344 --> 51:24.404
Welcome to the Thunderdome.

51:26.550 --> 51:29.178
Hey, man, are you sure it's cool
that we're here with you?

51:29.386 --> 51:30.717
Oh, definitely, man.

51:30.921 --> 51:32.889
I'm essentially
best friends with the guy...

51:33.090 --> 51:35.024
...so a bunch of my buds
are coming.

51:35.225 --> 51:38.023
We're gonna rock out
with our cocks out. Just kidding.

51:38.228 --> 51:40.958
- We are gonna rock out.
- Just go, just go.

51:41.164 --> 51:43.132
What's up? What's up? What's up?

51:44.367 --> 51:46.767
Hello, hello. Hey, guys.

52:04.554 --> 52:06.681
This is something
a smart person wouldn't do.

52:06.890 --> 52:09.518
Look, just act cool and act casual,
and try and look old.

52:09.726 --> 52:12.388
We'll get the booze
and get the fuck out of here, okay?

52:16.333 --> 52:18.460
Hey, where the party at? Right.

52:18.668 --> 52:21.432
- You got those shots, bro?
- It's coming.

52:22.439 --> 52:23.929
Come on, let's party.

52:24.141 --> 52:27.542
Come on. Do it up.

52:33.383 --> 52:35.544
We should grab one of these buckets
and get out.

52:35.752 --> 52:38.516
You out of your mind? How are we
gonna get a fucking bucket out?

52:38.722 --> 52:40.587
- Dude, what the fuck?
- Hey, man.

52:40.790 --> 52:42.587
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

52:42.792 --> 52:45.818
- What are you...? What? Nothing.
- You using my phone?

52:46.029 --> 52:49.658
- What do you think you're doing?
- Hang up. Nothing.

52:49.866 --> 52:51.731
What... What...
What's wrong, Mark?

52:51.935 --> 52:54.631
You weren't invited.
Get the fuck out of here.

52:54.838 --> 52:57.932
- Come on, Mark. It's cool, man.
- You using my fucking phone?

52:58.141 --> 52:59.938
You calling your
fucking friends again?

53:00.143 --> 53:02.236
You calling your friends,
your fantastic friends?

53:02.445 --> 53:04.345
No. I mean, yes. But I mean I'll...

53:04.548 --> 53:06.982
Come on, man, just relax.
Mark, please.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.345
Get the fuck out of here.
The fuck out of my house.

53:09.553 --> 53:11.020
Get the fuck out of my house.

53:11.221 --> 53:14.384
- This is my house.
- Don't be such a dick, man!

53:14.758 --> 53:16.157
What the fuck?

53:16.359 --> 53:18.350
Mark! You really wanna do this, man?

53:18.562 --> 53:21.156
Here we go.
We're really gonna do this?

53:22.699 --> 53:24.496
That's right, motherfucker.

53:25.635 --> 53:27.865
Come on, pussy. Get up, dude.

53:28.405 --> 53:31.135
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, bro.
I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro.

53:31.341 --> 53:34.936
Tiger got out of the cage, man.
All right? I'm sorry. Come on, Mark.

53:35.145 --> 53:37.306
Let's just chill.
Everyone just chill out.

53:37.814 --> 53:39.714
Truce, man.

53:42.619 --> 53:44.553
Right in the nads!

53:47.125 --> 53:50.686
This is for your friends.
Here, have another one.

53:50.896 --> 53:54.093
Shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
Oh, my God. What do we do?

53:54.299 --> 53:55.994
- Come on. Come on.
- Choose one.

53:57.102 --> 54:01.937
- We can slip out the back, man.
- Come on. Let's hurry up and do this.

54:02.140 --> 54:04.233
Are you crazy, man?
Wanna end up like that guy?

54:04.443 --> 54:07.003
Not me. I need my nuts, man,
for a lot of things.

54:07.212 --> 54:08.941
- We need liquor.
- You need it. I don't.

54:09.147 --> 54:11.809
I'm gonna tell Becca how I feel.
Maybe she'll get with me.

54:12.017 --> 54:14.315
I'm not gonna get her
drunk out of her mind.

54:14.519 --> 54:17.283
Oh, really? Then how come
you never made a move, you pussy?

54:17.489 --> 54:20.856
Because I respect her, Seth. I'm not
gonna put unfair pressure on her.

54:21.059 --> 54:23.050
I don't see a problem.
Let's just do it.

54:23.261 --> 54:25.957
We're leaving, okay?
You wanna get killed for liquor?

54:26.164 --> 54:29.463
No, but I would get killed for pussy,
no questions asked.

54:29.668 --> 54:32.796
- Fuck this, man.
- You're just gonna bail on me?

54:33.004 --> 54:35.871
- I'm going.
- Fucking bitch.

54:36.475 --> 54:38.773
Move, people.

54:39.778 --> 54:43.407
- Thank you.
- Oh, I love this place.

54:52.591 --> 54:54.218
What the hell is going on in there?

54:54.426 --> 54:56.656
If the bullets start flying,
hit the deck.

54:56.862 --> 54:59.057
You pissed everywhere,
you son of a bitch!

54:59.264 --> 55:02.495
Everywhere? You didn't
see me pissing anywhere.

55:02.701 --> 55:04.430
I don't know
what you're talking about.

55:04.636 --> 55:06.331
Take your nuts out of your shells!

55:06.538 --> 55:08.130
Michaels, I got your back.

55:08.340 --> 55:10.240
Why don't you show this rummy
how we roll?

55:10.442 --> 55:11.739
10-4.

55:12.344 --> 55:15.336
Excuse me, sir.
Stop what you are doing at once.

55:16.648 --> 55:19.776
- Blue guys!
- Resisting. Resisting!

55:19.985 --> 55:21.543
- Slater!
- Michaels!

55:22.020 --> 55:23.248
Everybody stay calm.

55:25.123 --> 55:28.286
- Everybody stay calm.
- Get the fuck out of my way!

55:28.693 --> 55:30.456
Stay calm! Fuck!

55:31.396 --> 55:33.296
- Should I shoot him?
- No, no, no!

55:33.498 --> 55:35.762
- No!
- Stop him, McLovin!

55:35.967 --> 55:38.697
McLovin, stop him!
Do it, do it, do it, do it!

55:43.241 --> 55:46.472
Please stop it, you fucking bum.
What the fuck?

56:01.159 --> 56:04.151
McLovin! Nice!

56:04.729 --> 56:06.629
He just came at me.
I took him down.

56:06.832 --> 56:09.357
- I'm buying you a beer, McLovin.
- I'm buying you one too.

56:09.568 --> 56:12.128
Take note. That's how
you take down a motherfucker.

56:12.337 --> 56:13.702
That's right.

56:13.905 --> 56:16.465
McLovin in the fucking house!

56:51.243 --> 56:55.577
Hey. You dance hot.

56:56.515 --> 56:58.210
Thank you.

57:14.032 --> 57:17.832
Okay, okay. Here we... Here we go.

57:18.703 --> 57:20.398
- Hello?
- <i>Evan, it's Becca.</i>

57:20.605 --> 57:22.334
Oh, Becca. Hi.

57:22.541 --> 57:26.773
Hey. Hello. Hey. Becca.

57:27.178 --> 57:28.668
- Becca...
- <i>Evan, can you hear me?</i>

57:28.880 --> 57:30.905
- Hello? What?
- <i>Can you hear</i>...<i>? Piece of shit!</i>

57:31.116 --> 57:33.482
Guy sells me
a piece of shit fucking phone.

57:33.685 --> 57:35.118
- Becca?
- It's Becca.

57:35.320 --> 57:37.311
<i>I get one bar</i>
<i>everywhere I fucking go.</i>

57:37.522 --> 57:40.286
- What is he saying?
- <i>Fucking asshole.</i>

57:40.492 --> 57:42.255
- I think...
- What happened?

57:42.460 --> 57:44.018
Son-of-a-fucking-bitch
phone company.

57:44.229 --> 57:46.891
- What? It's rude. Hello?
- <i>Fuck. You suck.</i>

57:47.098 --> 57:48.725
Bullshit phone. Piece of shit.

57:48.934 --> 57:51.266
<i>I swear I'll bitchslap you</i>
<i>so fucking hard.</i>

57:51.469 --> 57:53.027
- What?
- Bec...?

58:37.082 --> 58:38.947
Thanks.

58:40.652 --> 58:42.381
This is fucking crazy.

58:51.429 --> 58:54.694
Hey. Look what fell out of the truck!

58:56.534 --> 58:57.967
You're full of shit.

58:58.169 --> 59:00.103
Yeah, I know.

59:00.805 --> 59:05.401
Dude. Dude.
We're so gonna get fucked up.

59:05.610 --> 59:07.942
- All right.
- Hey.

59:08.480 --> 59:10.107
What is that?

59:11.483 --> 59:13.110
I don't know. What?

59:13.318 --> 59:17.049
That fucking stain on your pants, idiot.
What is that?

59:17.555 --> 59:19.648
- What are you talking about, man?
- Dude.

59:20.592 --> 59:23.026
- Is that blood?
- What the fuck is that?

59:23.228 --> 59:25.196
- Are you bleeding?
- I'm not cut or anything.

59:25.397 --> 59:28.093
- Why would I be bleeding?
- It's fucking blood, man.

59:29.267 --> 59:31.929
Were you dancing
with some chick in there?

59:32.504 --> 59:34.734
- Yeah, so?
- It's blood.

59:34.939 --> 59:38.466
- Dude, that's not funny.
- It's blood, dude.

59:38.677 --> 59:42.204
But why would I be bleeding?
Why the fuck would I be bl...?

59:42.414 --> 59:44.177
Dude, why would there be bl...?

59:46.484 --> 59:49.453
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.

59:51.656 --> 59:55.057
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna fucking throw up.

59:55.260 --> 59:56.784
Someone perioded
on my fucking leg?

59:56.995 --> 59:59.054
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck do I do?

59:59.264 --> 01:00:01.494
I've never before
seen that in my life!

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.361
This is so disgusting.

01:00:03.568 --> 01:00:05.058
- Yes, it is.
- I'm gonna go get Bill.

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:06.794
- He's gotta check this shit out.
- Fuck, yeah.

01:00:07.005 --> 01:00:10.202
No. Who's Bill? Don't tell Bill!
Bill has nothing to do with this!

01:00:10.408 --> 01:00:12.968
Hey, calm down.
Let me get a picture of that real quick.

01:00:13.178 --> 01:00:14.509
No, you can't have a picture!

01:00:14.713 --> 01:00:16.578
- Dude, stop!
- Bill, Bill! Check it out!

01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:18.681
This kid's got period blood
on his slacks.

01:00:18.883 --> 01:00:20.680
It's merlot.
That's what you don't get.

01:00:20.885 --> 01:00:23.513
Hey, Pat! This jerk-off's
got period blood on his pants!

01:00:23.722 --> 01:00:25.690
- Please stop.
- God, man, let me see.

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:28.825
Oh, my God,
that's a fucking man-gina, man.

01:00:29.027 --> 01:00:32.428
- Do you need a tampon? I could...
- Wait, wait. I have one! I have one!

01:00:33.098 --> 01:00:35.089
Yeah, right? I don't know.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.326
- I gotta wash this off. Is this the line?
- What does it look like?

01:00:38.536 --> 01:00:40.197
Fuck me, right?

01:00:55.453 --> 01:00:57.944
"Yeah, I'm McLovin.
I'd like to buy some..."

01:01:00.158 --> 01:01:01.750
Shit.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.292
- Rewind, rewind.
- Rewind it. Yeah!

01:01:04.496 --> 01:01:06.521
So hot. Let's see it again.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.401
- Your legs lifted off the ground.
- That is bona fide badass, man.

01:01:12.604 --> 01:01:14.970
You gotta keep that tape, McLovin.
It is badass.

01:01:15.173 --> 01:01:16.435
- It really is.
- Really?

01:01:16.641 --> 01:01:19.474
Well, don't you guys, like,
need it for, like, evidence or...?

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:22.840
The only thing that's evidence of
is you can take a hit like a champ.

01:01:23.047 --> 01:01:24.742
Seriously. Take that.

01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:29.545
Are there any ladies
we'd like to show this tape to?

01:01:30.321 --> 01:01:33.848
No. You don't wanna meet a chick
in a bar, man. Seriously.

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:36.686
That was a turning point
in my life, when I realized that.

01:01:36.895 --> 01:01:41.093
You gotta go to other places. You gotta
go to a spin class, a farmers' market...

01:01:41.299 --> 01:01:43.995
...pumpkin patch,
given the time of year.

01:01:44.202 --> 01:01:46.670
Just somewhere social,
non-threatening.

01:01:46.871 --> 01:01:50.102
- You know, something like that.
- Yeah, I met the missus at paintball.

01:01:50.308 --> 01:01:53.277
Yeah, I shot her in the neck.
And we just...

01:01:53.478 --> 01:01:55.343
And we just hit it off, you know.

01:01:55.547 --> 01:01:58.983
My first wife...
Who is a whore, by the way.

01:01:59.184 --> 01:02:00.515
- Where do you think I met her?

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:03.551
A bar. A bar.

01:02:03.755 --> 01:02:05.746
- It was this bar.
- It was this bar.

01:02:05.957 --> 01:02:08.118
Yeah, it was this bar.

01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:12.090
Bought her a Binion's,
complimented her on her tote bag...

01:02:12.297 --> 01:02:17.166
...and next thing I know, she's putting
her mouth around the tip of my penis.

01:02:17.969 --> 01:02:19.994
You don't have to tell me that.

01:02:20.205 --> 01:02:22.969
- Right in there.
- She opened up my world, sexually.

01:02:23.174 --> 01:02:25.574
On our wedding night,
we had group sex.

01:02:25.777 --> 01:02:27.142
I wasn't involved in it.

01:02:27.345 --> 01:02:29.870
- But I could hear it through the wall.
- I was.

01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:33.073
She was amazing. And then it was
exactly 23 months later...

01:02:33.284 --> 01:02:35.309
...that I found out
she was an actual whore.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.488
- We discovered her on the street.
- Yeah.

01:02:37.689 --> 01:02:39.122
I'm sorry.

01:02:39.324 --> 01:02:41.554
She was bad.
Fucking whoring bitch.

01:02:41.759 --> 01:02:45.195
- But you got a new wife now, so...
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:45.396 --> 01:02:47.694
And she is wonderful.

01:02:47.899 --> 01:02:49.867
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You'll meet her.

01:02:50.068 --> 01:02:52.229
You know what?
I bet I know your trick, McLovin.

01:02:52.437 --> 01:02:54.769
- You play the whole myst...
- <i>Calling all units.</i>

01:02:54.973 --> 01:02:56.600
Just turn that off.

01:02:56.808 --> 01:02:59.800
<i>Send backup!</i>
<i>There's so much blood</i>...

01:03:00.011 --> 01:03:03.742
I bet you play the whole
mysterious-guy thing, right?

01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:07.746
Yeah, seriously.
How's it going with the ladies?

01:03:08.019 --> 01:03:12.046
It's not the going with the ladies
I care about...

01:03:12.257 --> 01:03:15.055
...it's the coming.

01:03:16.928 --> 01:03:18.896
- I get it.
- What is it? What is it?

01:03:19.097 --> 01:03:20.394
Like:

01:03:20.598 --> 01:03:22.259
Like coming.

01:03:25.136 --> 01:03:29.368
- That's funny. That is really funny.
- Oh, my God.

01:03:34.379 --> 01:03:37.542
All right, looks like we got a call.
We can't pay for these.

01:03:37.749 --> 01:03:39.046
10-4. We'll be right there.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:41.878
- Speedy Gonzales, let's go.
- We should get road beers.

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.388
Hell, yeah,
we should get some road beers.

01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:46.750
Can I have 13 beers to go, please?

01:03:46.958 --> 01:03:50.189
Please. God, my fucking leg.

01:04:06.444 --> 01:04:08.105
Fuck.

01:04:34.339 --> 01:04:36.705
- I think it's him.
- Is it him?

01:04:36.908 --> 01:04:38.170
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Becca.</i>

01:04:38.376 --> 01:04:42.073
Hi, I had a bad reception.
So about your Goldslick...

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.976
- Guys, shut up.
- Hey, what's going on over there?

01:04:45.183 --> 01:04:47.242
It's nothing. It's just...

01:04:47.452 --> 01:04:50.319
I was just calling, you know,
to see if you were coming...

01:04:50.521 --> 01:04:53.752
...because I thought maybe you were
stuck at, like, a nightclub...

01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:56.483
...or a cocktail party or something.

01:04:56.694 --> 01:04:59.959
No, no, I'm gonna be there for sure.
Full throttle.

01:05:00.164 --> 01:05:01.859
- <i>Charlie's Angels 2.</i>
- <i>Awesome.</i>

01:05:03.768 --> 01:05:06.066
- <i>I can't wait to see you. Evan?</i>
- Okay, bye.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.728
That was the first time I ever did coke.
Off that bitch's nipple. That was so...

01:05:09.941 --> 01:05:11.670
- A little white sniff.
- That was awesome.

01:05:11.876 --> 01:05:12.843
That was gorgeous.

01:05:13.044 --> 01:05:16.309
Hey, hey, hey.
You guys, stay in this room, man.

01:05:16.514 --> 01:05:19.711
They're gonna kill that guy tonight.
That chick's boyfriend is pissed.

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:21.441
Yeah. He's a beast.

01:05:21.652 --> 01:05:24.678
I've been praying for a fight.
I'm literally waking up and praying...

01:05:24.889 --> 01:05:26.823
...to see a fucking fight.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.220
Who's that guy?

01:05:35.266 --> 01:05:36.255
- Hi.
- Who is that guy?

01:05:36.467 --> 01:05:38.492
- Who's this guy?
- Pleasure to see you fellas.

01:05:38.703 --> 01:05:39.761
Hi, everyone.

01:05:39.971 --> 01:05:41.632
- Who are you?
- I'm nobody.

01:05:41.839 --> 01:05:43.397
No, no, no. I know you. I know you.

01:05:43.608 --> 01:05:45.838
He was at that party
I was telling you about.

01:05:46.044 --> 01:05:47.204
- No, no.
- Who is it?

01:05:47.412 --> 01:05:50.540
Remember? He's Jimmy's brother.
The guy. The singer.

01:05:50.982 --> 01:05:53.382
- No.
- He's the guy with the beautiful voice.

01:05:53.584 --> 01:05:56.144
- The fucking singer, Jimmy's brother!
- That's not me, man.

01:05:56.354 --> 01:05:58.083
- Oh, my God.
- Sing for us! Sing.

01:05:58.289 --> 01:05:59.756
"It's not me"? You fucking lying?

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:03.051
No, I don't mean to accuse you guys
of being ill-informed, but...

01:06:03.261 --> 01:06:05.627
My brother came from Scottsdale,
Arizona to be here.

01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:07.195
You're not gonna sing for him?

01:06:07.398 --> 01:06:08.558
- Fucking bullshit.
- Sing.

01:06:08.766 --> 01:06:10.927
- You're a fucking singer.
- You sing good.

01:06:11.135 --> 01:06:12.602
- Sing it again.
- Like a bird.

01:06:12.804 --> 01:06:15.466
- No, I know, I just... I want to.
- You want a line of cocaine?

01:06:15.673 --> 01:06:16.765
- No way, man.
- Yeah.

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:19.135
Don't make this weird. Sing.

01:06:19.343 --> 01:06:21.504
- Sing it again.
- Turbo.

01:06:25.883 --> 01:06:27.908
- Fuck! Over!
- Okay, watch this.

01:06:28.119 --> 01:06:30.952
I'll get it right on the nose.

01:06:31.155 --> 01:06:33.385
You're gonna fuck it up.
You're gonna fuck it up.

01:06:33.591 --> 01:06:35.422
Under!

01:06:35.626 --> 01:06:37.821
I feel hammered.
That doesn't make any sense.

01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:40.623
- You're a fucking pussy.
- Okay, okay. Great, great.

01:06:40.832 --> 01:06:44.290
- Okay, McLovin, see if you can do it.
- The kid's gonna nail it.

01:06:44.502 --> 01:06:47.369
Come on, McLovin.
Do it, buddy. Come on, buddy!

01:06:47.572 --> 01:06:50.166
- Bring it!
- 0.08, motherfuckers!

01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:53.036
- Man!
- That's my boy!

01:06:53.444 --> 01:06:55.378
- Yes!
- Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck.

01:06:56.247 --> 01:06:59.045
So, what's it like to have guns?

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:01.946
It is awesome, McLovin.

01:07:02.153 --> 01:07:03.814
- I mean, it's mindbl...
- It's great.

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:06.751
I haven't had one for long,
a few months, but I'll tell you...

01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:08.721
...it's like having two cocks.
- Yup.

01:07:08.926 --> 01:07:11.759
If one of your cocks
could kill someone.

01:07:12.864 --> 01:07:15.424
- Can I hold one?
- What?

01:07:15.633 --> 01:07:16.930
Can I hold one of your guns?

01:07:20.204 --> 01:07:23.264
- Yeah, sure.
- Fine with me. Why not?

01:07:23.474 --> 01:07:25.772
Everyone should hold a gun
at least a couple times.

01:07:25.977 --> 01:07:27.410
Yeah, there you go.

01:07:27.612 --> 01:07:29.944
- Have a blast.
- "Have a blast."

01:07:30.148 --> 01:07:34.312
- That's funny.
- I've never held one of these before.

01:07:34.519 --> 01:07:37.249
- Are they hard to shoot?
- If you're Michaels, they are.

01:07:37.455 --> 01:07:39.150
- He can't shoot worth dick.
- What?

01:07:39.357 --> 01:07:40.847
I can shoot. What are you...? Wait.

01:07:41.058 --> 01:07:43.356
- I can't shoot worth dick?
- You cannot shoot.

01:07:43.561 --> 01:07:45.995
- I shot that cat last week.
- It was already dead, man.

01:07:46.197 --> 01:07:47.755
- I still shot it.
- That cat was dead.

01:07:47.965 --> 01:07:49.830
There's only one way
to settle this, guys.

01:07:50.401 --> 01:07:51.891
- Shoot-off.
- Shoot-off.

01:07:52.103 --> 01:07:54.936
- Shoot-off!
- Shoot-off!

01:07:55.139 --> 01:07:56.834
There's a lot of reasons
why I like you.

01:07:57.041 --> 01:07:59.339
I mean, you're handsome
and you're a good friend.

01:07:59.544 --> 01:08:03.571
Dude, there he is. That's the guy.
Hey, Mark, right there.

01:08:05.483 --> 01:08:06.507
Oh, you got a stain too.

01:08:08.352 --> 01:08:10.513
- We're blood brothers.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:08:10.721 --> 01:08:13.246
You're in my house,
you answer my questions.

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:15.357
What were you doing
dancing with Jacinda?

01:08:18.062 --> 01:08:19.323
I don't even dance. I just...

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:22.055
I don't even dance ever, so...
I've never even tried it.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:24.928
Then where the hell did this
come from, asshole?

01:08:26.404 --> 01:08:28.929
Maybe you and I rubbed up against
each other at some point.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:32.109
I don't remember. Maybe it was
some ricochet scenario. I don't know.

01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:34.335
- How am I supposed to know?
- Kick his ass, Mark.

01:08:34.545 --> 01:08:36.308
Shut the fuck up, Scarlett.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.877
Where do you get off
dancing with my fiancée?

01:08:48.326 --> 01:08:49.384
To some girl.

01:09:02.773 --> 01:09:04.104
Talk about the hurting.

01:09:14.352 --> 01:09:15.785
- Shit.
- All right.

01:09:38.776 --> 01:09:40.437
- Yo! Fight!
- Move it!

01:09:40.645 --> 01:09:42.374
- Go, check this out!
- Oh, fuck!

01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:44.548
And what the hell is this?

01:09:45.049 --> 01:09:48.348
- I don't fucking... It's detergent.
- Yeah, what are you doing with it?

01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:53.147
I got fucking blood on my pants.

01:09:53.357 --> 01:09:54.881
Get down.

01:09:56.894 --> 01:09:59.328
What the fuck is this all about, man?
Are you...?

01:10:00.364 --> 01:10:03.697
- Well, fuck me.
- Fellas.

01:10:04.268 --> 01:10:07.237
Oh, shit,
I've been tackled by little girls!

01:10:07.438 --> 01:10:08.530
You die! You're next!

01:10:11.275 --> 01:10:16.042
I should fucking kill you,
you motherfucker!

01:10:16.247 --> 01:10:20.206
- Hold him, Jimmy's brother! Hold him!
- What do you mean? No. No way!

01:10:20.418 --> 01:10:22.147
- You humiliated me!
- I'm sorry!

01:10:22.353 --> 01:10:25.914
- You used my leg as a tampon!
- I'm calling the cops.

01:10:26.123 --> 01:10:30.822
Evan! Come on! Move!

01:10:31.062 --> 01:10:33.690
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

01:10:33.898 --> 01:10:38.062
Yeah. Fifth and Paysview. Hurry.

01:10:38.269 --> 01:10:40.999
Mark, I called the cops.
You should hide your gun.

01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:42.830
You're a fucking pussy.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.268
Don't listen to him, officer.

01:10:44.475 --> 01:10:46.909
If you make this,
we're no longer friends, Michaels.

01:10:47.144 --> 01:10:49.544
- You're a fucking pussy.
- Cheating. You're cheating.

01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:55.345
- Fuck me.
- Oh, suck on my nuts, Slater!

01:10:55.553 --> 01:10:57.384
All right, you...
That was a lucky shot.

01:10:57.588 --> 01:11:00.751
- That was a lucky shot.
- I rule.

01:11:00.958 --> 01:11:02.186
I got jizzed on. All right.

01:11:02.426 --> 01:11:04.451
- Can I shoot one?
- Yeah, go nuts. Go nuts.

01:11:04.662 --> 01:11:06.129
Have a good time, man.

01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:09.231
Empty the clip.
Empty the clip on it, man. Shit!

01:11:09.433 --> 01:11:13.392
The cops! Bail! Bail! Bail!
Shotgun, shotgun! Damn it!

01:11:14.839 --> 01:11:16.204
Shotgun.

01:11:25.616 --> 01:11:28.176
- What a rush.
- What do you guys wanna do?

01:11:28.386 --> 01:11:30.820
- Man, let's get drunk!
- Let's get more fucked up!

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:33.114
You're fucking living the dream,
Michaels!

01:11:33.324 --> 01:11:34.291
Oh, man.

01:11:34.492 --> 01:11:36.221
This is gonna be the best night ever.

01:11:36.427 --> 01:11:38.861
- <i>Got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview.</i>
- Shit.

01:11:39.063 --> 01:11:41.429
<i>All units in the area report</i>
<i>to Fifth and Paysview.</i>

01:11:41.632 --> 01:11:43.930
- <i>Car 98, that's you. Do it.</i>
- Fuck.

01:11:44.135 --> 01:11:46.194
- Shit.
- Shit.

01:11:46.404 --> 01:11:49.669
Car 98 on it.
You dumb fucking whore.

01:11:49.874 --> 01:11:52.866
Hey, did she say we're gonna get
to shoot somebody or something?

01:11:53.077 --> 01:11:54.374
Oh, God, I wish.

01:11:54.612 --> 01:11:57.979
It's probably some lame house party.
We'll drop you off after. Cool?

01:11:58.215 --> 01:12:00.479
Yeah, man.
Let's show these fuckers how we roll!

01:12:15.166 --> 01:12:18.795
- You fucking prick.
- What?

01:12:21.739 --> 01:12:25.675
- You bailed on me.
- I didn't bail on you.

01:12:25.876 --> 01:12:27.935
Yeah, you did.

01:12:28.145 --> 01:12:30.978
You said you were gonna
do something and you didn't do it.

01:12:31.182 --> 01:12:32.308
That's bailing.

01:12:32.516 --> 01:12:35.747
You're the one that dragged me to
that fucking party with those lunatics.

01:12:35.953 --> 01:12:40.913
- I didn't bail on you.
- You bailed on me, okay?

01:12:41.125 --> 01:12:43.525
You bailed on me this morning
when Jesse spat on me...

01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:45.354
...and you're bailing on me
next year.

01:12:45.563 --> 01:12:48.623
What the fuck? It finally comes out.
That's good, man.

01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:50.767
We were supposed to go
to college together.

01:12:51.001 --> 01:12:53.060
Since we were kids,
since elementary school...

01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:55.704
...that's all we've ever talked about,
us going together.

01:12:55.906 --> 01:12:57.533
And you got into
fucking Dartmouth.

01:12:57.741 --> 01:12:59.732
You're making me feel
like I'm a bad guy.

01:12:59.944 --> 01:13:02.879
What...? I didn't do anything wrong.
I got into a good school.

01:13:03.647 --> 01:13:06.810
How the fuck am I supposed to get
into Dartmouth? You knew I couldn't.

01:13:07.051 --> 01:13:08.518
How fucking selfish are you?

01:13:08.719 --> 01:13:10.744
You had no problem letting Fogell
take the fall.

01:13:10.955 --> 01:13:12.923
You don't want me going
to a good school.

01:13:13.123 --> 01:13:15.114
- Fuck, man!
- So, what the fuck do you want?

01:13:15.326 --> 01:13:17.851
I'm not gonna let you
slow me down anymore, Seth.

01:13:21.031 --> 01:13:22.089
What are you saying?

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:26.530
I've wasted the last three years
sitting around talking bullshit with you.

01:13:26.737 --> 01:13:28.705
Instead of chasing girls
and making friends...

01:13:28.906 --> 01:13:31.898
...l've just sat around
wasting all my time with you.

01:13:32.109 --> 01:13:34.703
And now I'm going to college
a fucking friendless virgin.

01:13:34.945 --> 01:13:38.403
Is this about Becca?
This is about some girl, man?

01:13:38.616 --> 01:13:40.049
- I like her!
- Who gives a fuck?

01:13:40.251 --> 01:13:42.412
She's some fucking girl!
You gonna go out with her?

01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:45.111
- What about after that?
- Fuck you, you're a piece of shit.

01:13:45.623 --> 01:13:48.387
Fuck you! And next time
you're pissed off about something...

01:13:48.592 --> 01:13:51.425
...don't keep it inside for 10 years,
say it like a fucking man!

01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:52.596
- Don't touch me.
- Fuck you!

01:13:55.132 --> 01:13:58.067
Hey, McLovin, are the numbers
on your side odd or even?

01:13:58.269 --> 01:14:02.000
- I don't know. It's too dark to see.
- We got flashlights.

01:14:02.206 --> 01:14:03.969
Oh, that's true.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.545
Where the fuck are we?

01:14:12.416 --> 01:14:14.384
- Hey, Slater.
- What's that?

01:14:14.618 --> 01:14:16.347
Slater.

01:14:19.757 --> 01:14:23.386
Now, young Michaels, you will die.

01:14:24.962 --> 01:14:28.295
All right. Come on, stop it.
I can't fucking see. I can't see. Fuck it.

01:14:28.499 --> 01:14:30.296
- Like it?
- Hey, fuck off, that hurts.

01:14:30.501 --> 01:14:32.230
- You stop first.
- Not until you stop.

01:14:32.436 --> 01:14:34.063
- Stop it, asshole.
- Hey, you stop.

01:14:35.139 --> 01:14:37.164
- Fuck you, Evan!
- Don't fucking touch me.

01:14:49.086 --> 01:14:50.178
Why did you do that?

01:14:50.387 --> 01:14:52.548
- You shined the light in my face.
- You did too.

01:14:52.756 --> 01:14:54.781
- I'm driving.
- We were playing Lightsabers.

01:14:54.992 --> 01:14:57.017
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God.

01:14:57.227 --> 01:14:59.627
Are you guys gonna make sure
he's okay?

01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:04.128
- Check on him.
- You check.

01:15:04.335 --> 01:15:07.793
- You go out there and check on him.
- Fuck that. You go.

01:15:08.005 --> 01:15:12.339
Balls. Okay, we'll both go out there
and check on him.

01:15:13.811 --> 01:15:16.678
I can't believe this is happening again.
What are the odds?

01:15:17.214 --> 01:15:18.841
Fuck.

01:15:22.853 --> 01:15:26.550
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah, we're great, thanks.

01:15:26.757 --> 01:15:31.217
Hey, hey, where's the love?

01:15:31.428 --> 01:15:35.888
- He's okay. He's fine.
- Stand right next to your friend.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.931
- Get over there.
- I got them.

01:15:38.135 --> 01:15:39.466
You got these guys?

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:48.175
You boys doing
a bit of drinking tonight?

01:15:48.379 --> 01:15:52.509
- No, officer. Not at all. Not... We...
- We found those.

01:15:52.716 --> 01:15:53.842
I don't believe you.

01:15:57.521 --> 01:15:59.682
Freeze. Stand right there.

01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:01.949
- We're telling the truth.
- Keep it going.

01:16:02.159 --> 01:16:04.491
- Don't be a hero tonight, guys.
- Wrong night for that.

01:16:04.695 --> 01:16:06.253
You gotta fucking take care of this.

01:16:06.463 --> 01:16:10.524
No. Look, I am not fixing your mistakes
again, okay? Fuck that shit.

01:16:10.734 --> 01:16:13.032
I don't wanna get shitcanned.
I like this job.

01:16:13.237 --> 01:16:15.501
Me too. I get free haircuts.
I'm not taking the fall.

01:16:15.706 --> 01:16:17.333
Okay, okay!

01:16:18.342 --> 01:16:20.503
We're gonna arrest
these two little dipshits, okay?

01:16:20.711 --> 01:16:22.440
And we're gonna pin it on them.

01:16:23.113 --> 01:16:24.580
Yeah, do what you have to do.

01:16:31.055 --> 01:16:32.113
Spread your shit!

01:16:32.322 --> 01:16:35.348
Get on the ground!
Loaded gun, ready to go!

01:16:35.559 --> 01:16:38.153
Spread your shit!
Pussies on the pavement, fellas.

01:16:38.362 --> 01:16:40.557
- Come on!
- Please don't shoot, sir.

01:16:40.764 --> 01:16:43.358
"Please don't shoot."
Shut up and spread your shit!

01:16:44.935 --> 01:16:47.836
I am the law! Okay?

01:16:48.038 --> 01:16:49.164
Now hold hands.

01:16:49.373 --> 01:16:50.772
- What?
- Why?

01:16:50.974 --> 01:16:54.569
You don't want an asshole where your
face used to be, Whaling Jennings.

01:16:54.778 --> 01:16:57.178
- Hold his fucking hand!
- Fucking hold my hand.

01:16:57.381 --> 01:16:59.747
There. That's not so hard, is it?

01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:02.384
Here, McLovin, have a cigarette.

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.383
Smoke up. Life's short, you know.

01:17:06.156 --> 01:17:08.147
Suck it in, my friend.

01:17:08.358 --> 01:17:10.918
Suck it long and deep.

01:17:11.128 --> 01:17:12.618
Enjoy it.

01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:15.790
McLovin, McLovin, McLovin.

01:17:17.267 --> 01:17:22.500
- You like Officer Slater and myself?
- Yeah, you guys are awesome.

01:17:22.706 --> 01:17:25.834
Thanks.
We really like you too, McLovin.

01:17:26.043 --> 01:17:27.601
So here's what's about to happen.

01:17:27.811 --> 01:17:29.244
We're gonna arrest these guys...

01:17:29.446 --> 01:17:33.007
...you're gonna write a witness report
saying they leapt in front of our car...

01:17:33.217 --> 01:17:35.549
...and there was nothing we could do.
Sound cool?

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.721
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Good.

01:17:39.923 --> 01:17:42.221
That's good.
Pretend he's your little sister.

01:17:42.426 --> 01:17:44.417
Your little sister with the...

01:17:55.305 --> 01:17:56.329
What the fuck?

01:18:08.719 --> 01:18:10.243
Fagell?

01:18:19.563 --> 01:18:21.554
- Shit!
- Shit!

01:18:25.569 --> 01:18:26.934
Run! Run!

01:18:27.137 --> 01:18:28.365
Wait.

01:18:28.572 --> 01:18:31.973
Hold on, I gotta get all the booze.
Seth, wait up!

01:18:32.176 --> 01:18:33.837
McLovin bailed!

01:18:34.044 --> 01:18:36.103
Chase the kid!

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.812
Stop!

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:07.869
That was a fast kid.

01:19:10.547 --> 01:19:14.984
I want a ride! You hear me?
You can't unarrest me!

01:19:17.487 --> 01:19:18.977
Stop!

01:19:21.124 --> 01:19:25.026
- McLovin!
- Come on.

01:19:26.997 --> 01:19:28.157
McLovin!

01:19:28.899 --> 01:19:31.663
McLovin! Why?

01:19:33.604 --> 01:19:34.662
McLovin, come back!

01:19:36.573 --> 01:19:41.567
My hand! Monster!
Nicole! Nicole, get Daddy.

01:19:41.778 --> 01:19:44.269
- Get Daddy.
- Get Daddy!

01:19:44.481 --> 01:19:47.075
- Oh, shit.
- Get away from my kids!

01:19:50.387 --> 01:19:52.548
You sick sons of bitches!

01:19:55.559 --> 01:19:57.049
What the fuck?

01:20:02.833 --> 01:20:05.267
Michaels, are you okay?

01:20:05.502 --> 01:20:07.265
- It's just beer.
- Give me a break.

01:20:07.471 --> 01:20:09.063
- It's just beer.
- Man up.

01:20:09.273 --> 01:20:10.865
What happened?
What, did you lose him?

01:20:11.074 --> 01:20:13.838
He's a freak.
He's the fastest kid alive.

01:20:14.044 --> 01:20:16.569
- This is not good.
- He's the fastest kid alive.

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:19.839
Fastest kid alive, my ass. Come on.
What are we gonna do?

01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:22.050
I'll shoot my gun in the air.

01:20:22.286 --> 01:20:24.220
Give me a fucking warning
before you do it.

01:20:24.421 --> 01:20:26.389
I'll scare him out of wherever
he's hiding.

01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:29.252
This isn't gonna do shit.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

01:20:29.459 --> 01:20:31.290
This is your fault, you piece of...

01:20:31.828 --> 01:20:34.228
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
They shot Seth.

01:20:34.431 --> 01:20:36.558
They fucking shot Seth, I know it.

01:20:37.301 --> 01:20:38.529
Holy shit.

01:20:38.735 --> 01:20:39.724
Holy shit. Holy shit.

01:20:41.338 --> 01:20:42.430
- Should I run?
- Yes.

01:20:47.177 --> 01:20:49.270
- Fuck. Stop!
- Stop the bus!

01:20:49.479 --> 01:20:50.912
- Stop it!
- It's stopping.

01:20:51.114 --> 01:20:53.275
- It's stopping.
- Oh, thank God.

01:20:56.053 --> 01:20:58.283
Hey, Evan, pay for me, please.

01:21:00.657 --> 01:21:01.624
That's me and him.

01:21:02.726 --> 01:21:06.253
Hey, hey. It's you.

01:21:06.463 --> 01:21:07.691
McMuffin.

01:21:08.098 --> 01:21:09.463
- You know this guy?
- It's...

01:21:09.666 --> 01:21:13.693
Ain't got no cop people to help you
keep your booze now, do you?

01:21:13.904 --> 01:21:17.237
Hey! Back the fuck up, man,
or I'll beat the shit out of you.

01:21:17.441 --> 01:21:19.500
- Give me the booze.
- <i>Hey! Back the fuck up.</i>

01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:22.907
<i>Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.</i>

01:21:23.113 --> 01:21:24.774
Please, please, calm down, sir.

01:21:33.957 --> 01:21:39.293
Goldslick.

01:21:50.741 --> 01:21:52.834
Get off the bus
or I'm calling the cops.

01:21:59.549 --> 01:22:01.608
Eat shit, bum.

01:22:01.985 --> 01:22:04.078
Oh, shit, guys.
We're three blocks away, man.

01:22:04.287 --> 01:22:06.687
We made it. We made it
with the booze and everything.

01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:08.221
We made it.

01:22:08.425 --> 01:22:09.858
Hold this.

01:22:10.594 --> 01:22:13.119
I can't believe
you still have the liquor.

01:22:14.164 --> 01:22:15.222
It's awesome.

01:22:15.432 --> 01:22:18.492
Yeah, I told you the idea would work.
I fooled those cops.

01:22:18.735 --> 01:22:21.704
I'm McLovin. I am McLovin.

01:22:23.573 --> 01:22:24.972
Why do you guys have detergent?

01:22:25.175 --> 01:22:28.144
I don't understand why you were
smoking cigarettes with those cops.

01:22:28.345 --> 01:22:29.972
Because I fucking rule.

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:33.479
- We are so gonna get laid tonight.
- I am. I'm gonna get laid.

01:22:33.683 --> 01:22:36.083
We're finally gonna
get our drinks on.

01:22:38.255 --> 01:22:39.950
I can't believe Becca's bottle broke.

01:22:40.157 --> 01:22:41.522
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Yeah.

01:22:41.725 --> 01:22:44.626
I thought you didn't need it.
You were gonna tell her how you feel.

01:22:44.828 --> 01:22:47.353
Good luck getting Jules drunk enough
to have sex with you.

01:22:47.564 --> 01:22:49.498
- What's wrong with you guys?
- Nothing.

01:22:49.699 --> 01:22:52.862
You two femmes can talk about it
next year at your little slumber party.

01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:54.765
Oh, you told him.

01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:57.599
- Told me what?
- Yeah. You're an idiot, Fogell.

01:22:57.808 --> 01:22:59.605
- Well, we gotta tell him now.
- No, we...

01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:01.277
Well, he knows something's up.

01:23:01.511 --> 01:23:03.775
What are you guys talking about?
Tell me now.

01:23:04.014 --> 01:23:06.175
Seth, me and Evan are
rooming together next year.

01:23:06.383 --> 01:23:07.372
What's the big deal?

01:23:07.584 --> 01:23:09.518
"Oh, my God,
Fogell's rooming with Evan."

01:23:09.719 --> 01:23:11.414
Jeez, why don't you go cry about it?

01:23:11.621 --> 01:23:14.055
- I didn't tell you because...
- You're a backstabber...

01:23:14.257 --> 01:23:17.488
...and you lied to your best friend
and you just don't care anymore?

01:23:17.694 --> 01:23:19.889
I didn't expect this from you, Evan.

01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:21.523
Not from you.

01:23:21.731 --> 01:23:23.926
Give me that booze, Fagell.

01:23:27.504 --> 01:23:30.473
We never should have had to hide
our arrangement.

01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:42.982
- Seth's here.
- Seth, you're here.

01:23:43.186 --> 01:23:46.917
Hi. Everybody, Seth has got it.

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.307
- Evan.
- Gaby, hey.

01:24:12.516 --> 01:24:14.381
Where have you been?
You almost blew it.

01:24:14.584 --> 01:24:17.109
- What are you talking about?
- Becca. She's been waiting.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.617
She's over there.

01:24:19.489 --> 01:24:20.786
She's way smashed.

01:24:20.991 --> 01:24:23.289
And she's been yammering
about you all night.

01:24:23.493 --> 01:24:25.290
Really? What was she saying?

01:24:25.495 --> 01:24:27.588
She told you that she thinks
I'm a good guy?

01:24:27.797 --> 01:24:30.357
No, no.
She said something more like:

01:24:30.567 --> 01:24:33.092
"I will fully blow him tonight."

01:24:33.336 --> 01:24:35.668
- What?
- I know.

01:24:39.109 --> 01:24:41.339
- Yeah.
- But she's totally hammered...

01:24:41.545 --> 01:24:44.446
...and if I get with her
and I'm not drunk, isn't that unethical?

01:24:45.282 --> 01:24:46.681
Not if you're drunk too.

01:24:48.018 --> 01:24:49.383
I guess not.

01:24:49.586 --> 01:24:50.917
To Seth.

01:24:51.121 --> 01:24:53.316
- To Seth!
- All right.

01:24:53.523 --> 01:24:55.388
Who the fuck is Seth?

01:24:55.592 --> 01:24:57.287
I'm Seth!

01:24:58.995 --> 01:25:01.225
Let's do another one to me.

01:25:12.275 --> 01:25:13.867
Oh, boy.

01:25:14.611 --> 01:25:16.670
Calm down. Calm down, man.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.939
Calm down. She likes you.

01:25:19.316 --> 01:25:21.546
She wants to suck on your penis.

01:25:21.785 --> 01:25:23.412
It's a good thing.

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:27.283
It's the best thing.

01:25:28.091 --> 01:25:29.752
Just down the hatch.

01:25:57.587 --> 01:25:59.487
Fogell. What's up?

01:26:46.469 --> 01:26:48.767
Evan, hey. Evie, come here.

01:26:48.972 --> 01:26:50.371
Can you please help me up?

01:26:50.573 --> 01:26:54.134
I fell down and none of these assholes
will help me up.

01:26:54.344 --> 01:26:56.904
- Shit.
- Becca.

01:26:57.113 --> 01:26:59.206
I have been waiting for you
for, like, ever.

01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:01.384
- What took you so long?
- I know, it...

01:27:01.584 --> 01:27:04.018
- Do you have my Goldslick?
- No, I can't even...

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.881
It's such a crazy story, okay?

01:27:06.089 --> 01:27:09.388
- I swear I was try...
- It doesn't even matter.

01:27:09.592 --> 01:27:12.083
Look. Look what we...
We can just drink this.

01:27:12.295 --> 01:27:14.559
- Here. You could have a drink.
- Oh, no.

01:27:14.764 --> 01:27:16.755
- I'm already pretty wasted.
- Take a drink.

01:27:16.966 --> 01:27:19.332
Okay, here's to you.
This is to Becca.

01:27:19.536 --> 01:27:20.628
To Becca.

01:27:20.837 --> 01:27:23.169
- To the respecting...
- Guys.

01:27:23.373 --> 01:27:26.433
- Women.
To people respecting women.

01:27:26.643 --> 01:27:29.635
Okay. Yeah.

01:27:32.082 --> 01:27:33.310
You're a lightweight.

01:27:34.684 --> 01:27:36.049
Hey.

01:27:37.087 --> 01:27:40.352
You and me,
we should go upstairs, because...

01:27:40.557 --> 01:27:44.687
Because I need to
tell you something. Okay?

01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:47.422
You could just tell me here,
I mean...

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:52.363
I can't tell you, because
it's a secret for you from me.

01:27:52.569 --> 01:27:54.628
- All right.
- So come. Come on. Okay.

01:27:54.838 --> 01:27:55.998
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

01:27:56.206 --> 01:27:58.401
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:28:03.847 --> 01:28:07.112
You changed your name
to McLovin?

01:28:08.985 --> 01:28:11.613
- That's so cool.
- Thanks.

01:28:11.821 --> 01:28:15.689
So, like, what's Hawaii like?

01:28:16.359 --> 01:28:17.724
All right. I am back.

01:28:17.927 --> 01:28:20.191
I had to thank the peeps
for coming out, you know.

01:28:20.397 --> 01:28:22.888
Jules. I want you
to have a drink with me.

01:28:23.099 --> 01:28:25.465
Just drink some of this.
You're gonna love it.

01:28:25.668 --> 01:28:27.465
You're to...
I know you're gonna love it.

01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:31.231
- You know, I...
- It's green beer. For your information.

01:28:31.441 --> 01:28:34.069
You know, I'm actually good
right now. But thank you.

01:28:34.544 --> 01:28:37.775
And thank you very much
for bringing everything, again.

01:28:37.981 --> 01:28:39.608
Seriously, it really made the night.

01:28:39.816 --> 01:28:42.580
No, that's how I roll.
That's the thing.

01:28:42.786 --> 01:28:45.619
It's no problems. You'll learn that.

01:28:51.428 --> 01:28:56.058
I love talking
and conversing with you.

01:28:56.266 --> 01:28:59.258
But I can't hear you, though,
because the music is so loud.

01:28:59.469 --> 01:29:02.632
So do you wanna go outside
and talk more?

01:29:05.508 --> 01:29:08.136
Yeah. Sorry, sure.
You know, why not?

01:29:08.344 --> 01:29:10.312
Let's do it.
I haven't conversed in ages.

01:29:10.513 --> 01:29:13.971
- Okay. Ladies... Ladies first.
- Okay.

01:29:15.051 --> 01:29:17.019
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:19.620
- Watch your step. I fell earlier today.
- You serious?

01:29:19.823 --> 01:29:21.916
Well, I was hit by a car.
It's a long story.

01:29:22.492 --> 01:29:26.223
- Oh, shit. Careful.
- Okay, well...

01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:30.527
So loud. Don't let the parents hear.

01:29:31.167 --> 01:29:33.032
You look so pretty.

01:29:36.339 --> 01:29:40.537
- Are you okay?
- I so flirt with you in math.

01:29:40.743 --> 01:29:42.870
Tell me about it. I... Samesies.

01:29:43.079 --> 01:29:48.608
I've wanted to tell you for so long
that you're the best girl.

01:29:48.818 --> 01:29:53.721
I know. I've wanted to get with you,
like, so hard.

01:29:55.325 --> 01:29:57.657
Like so hard.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.500
You're the best.

01:30:05.702 --> 01:30:09.229
We'll take this sweater off. I think so.

01:30:09.439 --> 01:30:12.670
Just be careful, because it's a
meaningful sweater to me. It's vintage.

01:30:12.876 --> 01:30:13.934
Okay.

01:30:14.677 --> 01:30:17.544
- Bought it at that vintage market.
- Just hurry.

01:30:18.047 --> 01:30:20.572
- And this one.
- It's off.

01:30:20.783 --> 01:30:22.876
Hey, wait, careful.

01:30:24.053 --> 01:30:25.577
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my.

01:30:25.788 --> 01:30:26.982
Put that there.

01:30:27.190 --> 01:30:28.885
- Now, looky, looky...
- Okay.

01:30:29.092 --> 01:30:31.652
...what I got for you under here.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:30:31.861 --> 01:30:33.658
You are the prettiest girl...

01:30:33.863 --> 01:30:36.764
...this side of the Mississippi.
- I have a little something...

01:30:36.966 --> 01:30:39.833
...for you under here.

01:30:40.036 --> 01:30:41.060
You look so pretty.

01:30:41.538 --> 01:30:43.836
- Look so pretty.
- Under there.

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.871
Hello.

01:30:47.143 --> 01:30:49.168
For you.

01:30:53.783 --> 01:30:58.220
You're the best. You're so unique.

01:30:58.421 --> 01:30:59.888
Come here.

01:31:00.089 --> 01:31:02.421
Evan, kiss me.

01:31:02.759 --> 01:31:04.556
I like you so much.

01:31:05.628 --> 01:31:07.493
Come on, McLovin.

01:31:07.697 --> 01:31:09.528
I've never been
with an older guy before.

01:31:09.732 --> 01:31:13.065
Well, it's way better.

01:31:13.269 --> 01:31:15.464
I know, we made some
kick-ass tiramisu earlier.

01:31:15.672 --> 01:31:19.199
It was deli... It looked weird.
But it was delicious.

01:31:23.713 --> 01:31:26.910
What...? What's wrong?

01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:31.145
I... I would prefer
if we would just do that...

01:31:31.354 --> 01:31:34.881
...at some other time.

01:31:35.091 --> 01:31:38.151
No. There is no other time.
School is up.

01:31:38.361 --> 01:31:42.627
- What's wrong with right now?
- Well, I mean, you're... You're drunk.

01:31:43.333 --> 01:31:47.235
- You're, like, really, really drunk.
- So? You're drunk. You're drunk, Jules.

01:31:47.437 --> 01:31:50.406
Yeah, I'm actually...
I'm not drunk at all.

01:31:50.607 --> 01:31:53.167
I don't even drink, so it's...
I mean...

01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:57.470
Jules, you drink. You drink.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.513
Everybody... You...
You had me get liquor, so you drink.

01:32:00.717 --> 01:32:01.741
It's like...

01:32:01.951 --> 01:32:05.284
Well, yeah, because
I'm throwing a party, remember?

01:32:05.488 --> 01:32:07.080
Other people drink
and so I just...

01:32:07.290 --> 01:32:08.780
You...?

01:32:10.159 --> 01:32:13.492
You don't wanna, you know?

01:32:15.298 --> 01:32:18.233
Not right now.

01:32:18.434 --> 01:32:21.494
You know, not while you're drunk.

01:32:22.138 --> 01:32:24.129
But, you know, thank you.

01:32:29.479 --> 01:32:34.007
- Evan. Evan, I'm so wet.
- Oh, yeah.

01:32:34.217 --> 01:32:37.516
They said that would happen
in health, when I learned about it.

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:39.517
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:32:39.722 --> 01:32:42.885
- They taught me about...
- Who's down there?

01:32:43.092 --> 01:32:44.320
Yeah, it's your hand.

01:32:49.232 --> 01:32:52.599
- Thank you, that's good.
- You have such a smooth cock.

01:32:52.802 --> 01:32:54.827
Thank you.
You would too if you were a man.

01:32:55.038 --> 01:32:57.529
But you got such a smooth chest.

01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:00.402
I am gonna give you...

01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:05.047
...the best blow-J ever...

01:33:05.248 --> 01:33:07.648
...with my mouth.

01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:10.045
Why don't we...?
Why don't we just kiss a while?

01:33:10.253 --> 01:33:13.848
Why don't we keep kissing for a bit,
instead of...?

01:33:15.758 --> 01:33:17.316
How badly do you wanna fuck me?

01:33:17.794 --> 01:33:19.421
Jesus Christ.

01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:21.196
Jesus, fuck.

01:33:21.397 --> 01:33:22.659
- Hang on one second.
- What?

01:33:22.865 --> 01:33:24.594
Becca,
I don't think you wanna do this.

01:33:24.801 --> 01:33:28.703
- You're really drunk.
- No, I'm not. I am not drunk.

01:33:28.905 --> 01:33:33.069
- I see that you are. I think you are.
- And I really... I want you inside me.

01:33:33.276 --> 01:33:35.506
I want you to be my first.
I want you inside me.

01:33:35.712 --> 01:33:37.907
So just... Just go with it.

01:33:38.114 --> 01:33:40.048
- Let it happen.
- I know, but...

01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:42.541
Becca, this is kind of intense.

01:33:42.752 --> 01:33:47.086
And I just... I'm so drunk.
I can't even, like, process this.

01:33:47.290 --> 01:33:49.622
And you're really pretty.

01:33:49.826 --> 01:33:51.885
And I just think
this isn't how I pictured it.

01:33:52.095 --> 01:33:56.532
I don't understand why you have to be
such a little bitch about it.

01:33:57.734 --> 01:34:00.862
- Did you just call me a bitch?
- Yes, a scared...

01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:03.664
See, I, like,
I think we're not thinking clear...

01:34:03.873 --> 01:34:05.135
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

01:34:05.341 --> 01:34:07.707
- Go get Gaby.
- I'll go get her.

01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:12.643
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Go get Gaby, please.

01:34:26.863 --> 01:34:30.492
- I got a boner.
- Good.

01:34:31.801 --> 01:34:34.395
- Do you have a condom?
- Yes.

01:34:36.339 --> 01:34:38.307
And lube.

01:34:38.508 --> 01:34:39.998
Seth?

01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:46.414
Are...? Are you crying?

01:34:46.816 --> 01:34:49.683
No, I just have something
in both my eyes.

01:34:49.886 --> 01:34:51.046
I don't cry. That's funny.

01:34:51.254 --> 01:34:53.484
You look... You look...
It looks like you're crying.

01:34:53.689 --> 01:34:55.020
So...

01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:59.592
It was my last chance
and I fucked it up and...

01:34:59.796 --> 01:35:01.354
Your last chance to do what?

01:35:01.564 --> 01:35:04.590
To make you
my girlfriend for the summer.

01:35:05.201 --> 01:35:08.034
You're, like, the coolest person
that's ever talked to me.

01:35:08.237 --> 01:35:09.829
I thought we'd both be drunk.

01:35:10.039 --> 01:35:12.769
What does me being drunk
have anything to do with it?

01:35:12.975 --> 01:35:15.273
You'd never get with me
if you were sober.

01:35:15.478 --> 01:35:16.945
Look at you.

01:35:18.014 --> 01:35:22.212
- Look at me.
- Seth, come on, you didn't blow it.

01:35:22.819 --> 01:35:24.411
I think maybe...

01:35:25.054 --> 01:35:26.817
What the fuck?!

01:35:27.023 --> 01:35:28.684
Help me.

01:35:30.893 --> 01:35:31.860
Shirley.

01:35:32.061 --> 01:35:34.120
I'm sorry.

01:35:34.530 --> 01:35:37.021
- Someone forgot to call pest control.
- Yep.

01:35:37.233 --> 01:35:39.064
Where you going?
Hey, party's still on.

01:35:39.268 --> 01:35:40.496
- Where are you going?
- No.

01:35:40.703 --> 01:35:43.900
If you're back there, get out.
Everyone, come on.

01:35:44.106 --> 01:35:45.869
- We will shoot you.
- Party's over.

01:35:46.075 --> 01:35:47.565
- Evan.
- Get the hell out of here.

01:35:47.777 --> 01:35:49.438
Keep your hands up.

01:35:55.218 --> 01:35:57.914
Life's bullshit, Miroki.

01:36:07.296 --> 01:36:09.264
Ev, wake the fuck up, man.

01:36:09.465 --> 01:36:11.763
We gotta go.
Those fucking cops are here, man.

01:36:15.071 --> 01:36:17.369
"Oh, no, it's the cops."
We have a complaint.

01:36:17.573 --> 01:36:20.098
- Evan, come on.
- Get the hell out of here right now.

01:36:20.309 --> 01:36:21.936
Get out of here.
She's not interested.

01:36:22.144 --> 01:36:24.840
- Drop the crantini and move it, sister.
- See you, sugar tits.

01:36:25.047 --> 01:36:26.014
Guys, come on, move.

01:36:26.215 --> 01:36:29.343
Everybody out.
Leave the booze and go.

01:36:30.519 --> 01:36:31.713
What the fuck, man?

01:36:32.521 --> 01:36:33.783
What the fuck, Seth?

01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:36.220
He's my best friend. Oh, shit.

01:36:36.826 --> 01:36:39.226
Oh, shit. Come on.

01:36:39.428 --> 01:36:42.056
I assume you all have guns
and crack.

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:48.531
Oh, my God, come on. Don't stop.

01:36:51.107 --> 01:36:52.472
Okay, everyone...

01:36:52.675 --> 01:36:55.508
...prepare to be fucked
by the long dick of the law.

01:36:55.711 --> 01:36:57.474
Get out.

01:36:59.282 --> 01:37:00.271
Come on, go.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.078
Fuck off, Seth.

01:37:08.658 --> 01:37:09.852
Get a room.

01:37:10.059 --> 01:37:12.459
I'm gonna save you.
I'm gonna save you, Evan.

01:37:14.096 --> 01:37:15.757
Fuck.

01:37:17.433 --> 01:37:20.630
Fuck. Fuck, man, so heavy.

01:37:35.952 --> 01:37:38.352
It's in. Oh, my God, it's in.

01:37:38.554 --> 01:37:40.920
All right, everybody out.
Come on, let's go.

01:37:41.123 --> 01:37:43.489
McLovin! What the fuck?

01:37:43.693 --> 01:37:46.059
- Officer Slater, is that you?
- You ran away from us.

01:37:46.262 --> 01:37:48.230
Why did you run away?
Michaels, get up here.

01:37:48.431 --> 01:37:50.365
- No. I didn't run away.
- What the fuck?

01:37:50.566 --> 01:37:51.555
Why would you do that?

01:37:51.767 --> 01:37:54.258
- I was disoriented from...
- Were you violating that girl?

01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:56.870
You just violated her with your penis?
Michaels, look.

01:37:57.073 --> 01:37:58.438
- McLovin?
- No, no, no.

01:37:59.008 --> 01:38:00.498
No.

01:38:01.143 --> 01:38:02.940
Holy shit.
Were you just getting laid?

01:38:03.145 --> 01:38:05.807
No. Yeah, I was, but...

01:38:06.015 --> 01:38:08.279
- Yes, yes, he was.
- It's not what you think, guys.

01:38:08.484 --> 01:38:10.679
- I'm not even...
- Sit the fuck down. Stay down.

01:38:10.886 --> 01:38:12.717
- Calm down.
- I thought we were friends...

01:38:12.922 --> 01:38:14.389
...and then you go running away.

01:38:14.590 --> 01:38:16.217
Contain yourself.

01:38:16.425 --> 01:38:17.915
- We're friends.
- Shut up.

01:38:18.127 --> 01:38:20.391
- Calm down. Calm down, man.
- Why? What?

01:38:20.596 --> 01:38:22.188
You just cock-blocked McLovin.
Okay?

01:38:22.398 --> 01:38:23.888
He's our friend. We don't do that.

01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:27.433
We should be guiding his cock,
not blocking it.

01:38:27.636 --> 01:38:31.367
Just relax, okay?
Let's make this right.

01:38:39.048 --> 01:38:41.312
Wait, what are you...?
What are you guys doing?

01:38:41.517 --> 01:38:44.714
No, please, I can't... I can't go to jail.
Please, I can't go to jail.

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:48.720
No, look.
We're really sorry, McLovin.

01:38:48.924 --> 01:38:52.257
This has... This has gone on...
This has gone way too far.

01:38:52.461 --> 01:38:55.521
What? What are you talking about?

01:38:55.731 --> 01:38:59.667
We know you're not 25, man.
We're not idiots, McLovin.

01:38:59.869 --> 01:39:02.360
- Yeah.
- Did you know the whole time?

01:39:02.571 --> 01:39:07.736
Look, when we were your age,
we hated cops.

01:39:07.943 --> 01:39:11.106
When we saw you
in the liquor store today, we just...

01:39:11.313 --> 01:39:13.372
I guess we saw a bit of ourselves,
you know...

01:39:13.582 --> 01:39:16.676
...and we just wanted
to show you that...

01:39:16.886 --> 01:39:19.252
...you know, cops can have
a fun time too, you know?

01:39:19.455 --> 01:39:21.047
Yeah.

01:39:21.824 --> 01:39:26.352
You know, in a way,
I think we wanted to show ourselves.

01:39:28.097 --> 01:39:30.429
Also, I'm...

01:39:30.633 --> 01:39:33.761
I'm really sorry
that I blocked your cock.

01:39:34.437 --> 01:39:37.565
- Apology accepted.
- Seriously, man.

01:39:38.607 --> 01:39:40.165
That feels good.

01:39:40.376 --> 01:39:42.241
- It feels so good.
- I missed you guys.

01:39:42.445 --> 01:39:44.811
I just wish we could
make it up to you somehow, man.

01:39:45.014 --> 01:39:47.642
Well, do you think
you can do me a really big favor?

01:39:47.850 --> 01:39:49.909
- What is it? Anything.
- Name it.

01:39:50.119 --> 01:39:53.145
- This kid's fucking crazy.
- Stay back for your own safety.

01:39:53.355 --> 01:39:55.653
Get off me, you fucking cops.
Get your hands off.

01:39:55.858 --> 01:39:58.383
Do you know who I am?
I'm Fogell.

01:39:59.261 --> 01:40:02.662
- The joint can't hold me.
- Holy shit, Fogell's a badass.

01:40:02.865 --> 01:40:05.834
I'm gonna break your glasses,
you fucking cop. You can't hold me.

01:40:06.035 --> 01:40:07.127
Fucking pigs.

01:40:12.108 --> 01:40:13.302
Oh, shit.

01:40:15.911 --> 01:40:17.503
Nice mullet, asshole.

01:40:18.147 --> 01:40:20.012
- You crazy.
- This kid's crazy.

01:40:20.216 --> 01:40:23.276
He's nuts.
Well, we caught the infamous Fogell.

01:40:23.486 --> 01:40:25.113
Get your hands...
Wait for me, Nicola.

01:40:25.321 --> 01:40:26.754
Wait for me on the outside.

01:40:27.690 --> 01:40:29.817
We were gonna go to Hawaii.

01:40:30.926 --> 01:40:32.621
Man, that's gonna get you
so much ass.

01:40:32.828 --> 01:40:33.795
Seriously?

01:40:33.996 --> 01:40:37.193
- I know what to do about the car.
- Sweet.

01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:41.429
Fucking go. Fucking throw up.

01:40:45.307 --> 01:40:46.672
Are you carrying me?

01:40:46.876 --> 01:40:49.003
No, I'm saving you from the cops.

01:40:49.378 --> 01:40:50.367
You saved me?

01:40:52.214 --> 01:40:55.149
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about, but thanks.

01:40:55.351 --> 01:40:57.478
Can I... Should I just walk?

01:40:57.686 --> 01:41:01.213
- Should I walk?
- Yeah, sure.

01:41:01.991 --> 01:41:05.984
- Okay.
- Where do you wanna go?

01:41:06.829 --> 01:41:09.957
Sleepover at my house?
You wanna come sleep...?

01:41:11.667 --> 01:41:14.636
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:41:17.706 --> 01:41:19.401
Does your mom
still have pizza bagels?

01:41:19.608 --> 01:41:21.235
Yeah. Lots.

01:41:21.443 --> 01:41:23.377
Pizza bagels.

01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:34.214
So by signing this,
you are officially saying...

01:41:34.423 --> 01:41:36.857
...that as we stopped you
from being mugged...

01:41:37.059 --> 01:41:39.960
...a crackhead stole our cruiser
and did God knows what with it.

01:41:40.162 --> 01:41:42.756
- You cool to sign that?
- Of course. I owe you guys my life.

01:41:42.965 --> 01:41:45.559
We owe you, Mc...
Wait, what's your real name again?

01:41:45.768 --> 01:41:46.792
- Fogell.
- Fuck that.

01:41:47.002 --> 01:41:49.562
- We're calling you McLovin.
- McLovin.

01:41:49.772 --> 01:41:52.172
Let's do this dance, boys.

01:42:15.764 --> 01:42:18.426
- Oh, my God.
- What did I tell you guys, right?

01:42:18.634 --> 01:42:19.601
That was crazy.

01:42:25.608 --> 01:42:26.802
All right.

01:42:27.009 --> 01:42:28.943
All right, now, guys, check this out.

01:42:29.144 --> 01:42:32.341
It's probably the greatest move
in doughnut-spinning history.

01:42:32.548 --> 01:42:33.537
You paying attention?

01:42:33.749 --> 01:42:37.014
Behold, the upward-spiraling pigtail.

01:42:37.219 --> 01:42:40.484
- Why is it called that?
- I don't know.

01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.753
Make the badge proud, Slater.

01:42:48.764 --> 01:42:50.925
He's not usually this drunk
when he does this...

01:42:51.133 --> 01:42:54.261
...but I think
that could make it more cool.

01:42:59.375 --> 01:43:01.104
McLovin!

01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:12.678
Oh, no.

01:43:13.489 --> 01:43:14.820
Fuck.

01:43:21.230 --> 01:43:24.597
- Slater!
- Officer Slater.

01:43:26.402 --> 01:43:29.337
All right. Fucking crazy.

01:43:30.139 --> 01:43:31.106
Let's do this.

01:43:31.974 --> 01:43:36.138
- Hurry, hurry. Let's go. Go, go.
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

01:43:36.345 --> 01:43:38.506
- I'm out, I'm out.
- Good, here we go, here we go.

01:43:38.714 --> 01:43:40.807
Yeah? Yeah, okay. Back up.

01:43:41.016 --> 01:43:43.610
Don't blow yourself up, asshole.

01:43:48.791 --> 01:43:52.283
Yes. Oh, my God.

01:43:52.494 --> 01:43:54.894
It worked. It worked.

01:43:55.097 --> 01:43:59.033
We won. We won.

01:44:07.643 --> 01:44:09.543
Can we shoot at it?

01:44:10.713 --> 01:44:13.841
I don't know. Can you?

01:44:32.668 --> 01:44:34.363
Break yourself, fool.

01:44:40.743 --> 01:44:42.233
Tight.

01:44:42.444 --> 01:44:45.038
Listen, and then she said
she was gonna give me a blow-J.

01:44:45.247 --> 01:44:48.978
- I can't believe she said that to you.
- Man, you have no idea.

01:44:49.184 --> 01:44:52.051
- What was she thinking?
- You don't even know.

01:44:59.862 --> 01:45:03.855
I gotta tell you.
I gotta tell you something, Evan.

01:45:04.066 --> 01:45:05.397
What?

01:45:05.601 --> 01:45:07.466
I was in your room, like,
three weeks ago...

01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:09.899
...while you were taking a shit.

01:45:10.105 --> 01:45:15.099
And I saw your housing, like, forms.

01:45:15.611 --> 01:45:19.809
So I knew you and Fogell
were gonna live together, you know.

01:45:20.015 --> 01:45:22.575
I'm sorry, man, I don't know.

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:28.716
I should've told you.
I don't know why I didn't.

01:45:28.924 --> 01:45:31.654
Don't... No, don't be sorry.
I should be sorry.

01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:34.590
I was being a dick.
I was being a big dick to you.

01:45:34.797 --> 01:45:36.025
No, I...

01:45:36.231 --> 01:45:40.634
Listen, Seth, I want you to know,
I don't wanna live with Fogell.

01:45:40.836 --> 01:45:45.796
I never wanted to live with him.
I just don't... I ha...

01:45:46.008 --> 01:45:48.169
I'm afraid to live with strangers.

01:45:50.045 --> 01:45:51.171
I can't.

01:45:52.281 --> 01:45:54.249
I can't do it.

01:45:55.651 --> 01:45:58.381
I know, I know.

01:45:59.688 --> 01:46:02.555
I can't believe you saved me.

01:46:04.226 --> 01:46:06.353
You saved me.

01:46:06.562 --> 01:46:09.463
I can't believe. I owe you so...

01:46:10.332 --> 01:46:14.462
You carried me. I love you.

01:46:15.103 --> 01:46:16.536
I love you, man.

01:46:19.508 --> 01:46:21.533
I love you.

01:46:22.978 --> 01:46:27.608
I love you. I'm not even
embarrassed to say it. I just...

01:46:27.816 --> 01:46:29.784
I lo... I love you.

01:46:29.985 --> 01:46:31.646
- I'm not embarrassed.
- I love you.

01:46:31.854 --> 01:46:33.321
I love you.

01:46:33.522 --> 01:46:36.286
Why don't we say that every day?
Why can't we say it more often?

01:46:36.492 --> 01:46:38.722
I just love you. I just wanna
go to the rooftops and scream:

01:46:38.927 --> 01:46:40.224
"I love my best friend, Evan."

01:46:40.429 --> 01:46:44.058
- We should go up on my roof.
- For sure.

01:46:44.266 --> 01:46:50.068
Like, when you went away for Easter,
on your vacation, I missed you.

01:46:50.272 --> 01:46:53.730
- I missed you too.
- I want the world to know.

01:46:54.176 --> 01:46:58.840
It's... It's the most beautiful thing
in the world.

01:47:02.451 --> 01:47:05.978
Come here. Come here, man.

01:47:16.665 --> 01:47:19.190
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:47:32.214 --> 01:47:34.273
What the fuck?

01:47:41.657 --> 01:47:46.651
- What up?
- Morning. Morning.

01:47:47.129 --> 01:47:49.620
I should get moving.
I should get moving.

01:47:49.831 --> 01:47:52.026
I should be getting
a move on, for sure.

01:47:52.234 --> 01:47:55.203
Yeah, you don't...
I mean, you don't have to, you know.

01:47:55.404 --> 01:47:58.464
I don't really have anything
going on.

01:47:58.674 --> 01:48:01.199
You don't have to rush off like that.

01:48:04.713 --> 01:48:06.738
You wanna hang out?

01:48:07.182 --> 01:48:09.616
I was gonna go to the mall.

01:48:09.818 --> 01:48:13.254
I have to get a new comforter.

01:48:13.889 --> 01:48:16.380
For college.
The mall, they would sell that.

01:48:16.592 --> 01:48:18.150
Cool. So...

01:48:19.528 --> 01:48:21.792
...your mom's got huge tits.

01:48:24.433 --> 01:48:25.695
What do you think?

01:48:25.901 --> 01:48:27.266
I don't know, man. Don't ask me.

01:48:27.469 --> 01:48:30.233
Because I don't give a shit
how pants look.

01:48:30.439 --> 01:48:32.805
Yeah, I need someone's opinion.

01:48:33.008 --> 01:48:36.341
Those are too tight.
Those are way too tight.

01:48:36.545 --> 01:48:39.013
- Yeah, but, like...
- Way too tight. You need to upgrade.

01:48:39.214 --> 01:48:41.774
There's not enough pants where
there should be. More pants.

01:48:41.984 --> 01:48:44.350
Yeah, but...
I mean, does it look weird?

01:48:44.553 --> 01:48:47.920
Looks like you're standing funny. You
wouldn't stand like that. Like a duck.

01:48:48.123 --> 01:48:49.886
Yeah, but I'm doing like...

01:48:50.092 --> 01:48:53.323
- I'm doing the college poses like...
- I don't know if you are.

01:48:53.528 --> 01:48:55.428
- You might just be doing...
- Hey, prof.

01:48:55.631 --> 01:48:57.690
- Okay.
- That test was...

01:48:58.333 --> 01:49:02.201
Hey, Susan. Are you gonna
party tonight or no?

01:49:02.404 --> 01:49:05.965
Yeah, but that's just... It's like I wish
there were more pants where...

01:49:06.208 --> 01:49:07.436
You know, where there aren't.

01:49:07.676 --> 01:49:09.541
But when I was wearing
your dad's pants...

01:49:09.745 --> 01:49:12.543
...I realized that if I wear pants
that are a little too small...

01:49:12.748 --> 01:49:14.443
...it might encourage me
to lose weight.

01:49:14.650 --> 01:49:16.550
And also,
chicks can kind of see, like...

01:49:16.752 --> 01:49:19.380
...you know, the borders
and outline of my dick a little.

01:49:19.588 --> 01:49:22.557
Yeah, man, they go nuts for that.
The male camel toe.

01:49:22.758 --> 01:49:25.750
Yeah, the camel tail. It's right...

01:49:25.961 --> 01:49:27.622
I know where it is, where it happens.

01:49:27.829 --> 01:49:29.490
Like, right there.

01:49:29.698 --> 01:49:33.259
It's like they're so tight that one ball is,
like, above my dick, even.

01:49:33.468 --> 01:49:35.163
- Yeah, exactly.
- It's like three.

01:49:35.370 --> 01:49:37.964
It's like a three thing.
It's like ball, dick, ball.

01:49:38.173 --> 01:49:39.538
It's like a division sign.

01:49:39.741 --> 01:49:41.538
Like a bunch of people
crammed into a van.

01:49:42.477 --> 01:49:46.208
- Making my ass look weird?
- It makes a lot of stuff look weird.

01:49:46.548 --> 01:49:47.981
No, those are way too tight.

01:49:48.817 --> 01:49:51.581
You're right, these look stupid.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:49:51.787 --> 01:49:55.052
I'm really sorry about that.
I can't believe I actually did that.

01:49:55.257 --> 01:49:57.316
I feel bad that I'm making you
buy me a new one.

01:49:57.526 --> 01:49:58.788
It's seems, like, ridiculous.

01:49:58.994 --> 01:50:03.021
- No. I have to, it's puke. It's gross.
- Oh, my God.

01:50:03.231 --> 01:50:05.722
Do alcoholics get hangovers?

01:50:05.934 --> 01:50:08.732
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
It's them.

01:50:09.638 --> 01:50:13.540
- What the fuck do we do, man?
- Don't stop. I don't know.

01:50:15.377 --> 01:50:17.811
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:50:18.747 --> 01:50:20.442
How's it going?

01:50:22.184 --> 01:50:24.948
It's so good to...
How are you feeling?

01:50:25.587 --> 01:50:29.079
I've felt better. But I'll be fine.
How about you?

01:50:30.192 --> 01:50:34.322
I'm okay, you know, yeah.
Did you have fun last night?

01:50:36.865 --> 01:50:40.392
You know,
I actually don't remember much.

01:50:40.602 --> 01:50:42.126
I don't remember anything.

01:50:43.038 --> 01:50:46.007
- So weird.
- Nothing.

01:50:46.508 --> 01:50:49.102
I didn't puke on you, did I?

01:50:49.578 --> 01:50:51.808
You didn't.
I remember that you... I avoided it.

01:50:52.013 --> 01:50:56.109
It whizzed right by me, and I said,
"Stay away from me," you know.

01:50:56.752 --> 01:51:02.691
I'm really sorry about
everything last night, and I just...

01:51:04.359 --> 01:51:06.793
Thank you for being
such a nice guy about it all.

01:51:07.696 --> 01:51:09.323
That's okay, you know.

01:51:09.531 --> 01:51:12.125
At least you don't have
a black eye from it.

01:51:15.537 --> 01:51:18.665
- That looks terrible.
- Yeah.

01:51:19.574 --> 01:51:23.874
You look great. You don't look terrible.
It's just, like, a bad bruise.

01:51:24.079 --> 01:51:26.809
Everything's great, just from he...
This, just like right there.

01:51:27.015 --> 01:51:28.607
- Your eye.
- Yeah, your eye.

01:51:28.817 --> 01:51:30.444
Everything else is great.

01:51:30.652 --> 01:51:34.645
But seriously,
I acted like a fucking idiot last night.

01:51:37.359 --> 01:51:41.557
You don't deserve that.
So I'm sorry.

01:51:42.397 --> 01:51:46.197
On the upside,
I think you look cool with a black eye.

01:51:46.401 --> 01:51:49.768
I'm just gonna throw that out there.
I don't... I don't know.

01:51:49.971 --> 01:51:53.964
Well, thank you, smart guy.
Thanks. That's actually why I'm here.

01:51:54.176 --> 01:51:57.475
Because I have to get
a ton of cover-up for the grad photo.

01:51:57.679 --> 01:52:00.113
Oh, man. Fuck.

01:52:00.315 --> 01:52:02.715
And I'm gonna get Jules
a new comforter.

01:52:02.918 --> 01:52:04.852
I have to get a comforter too.
For college.

01:52:05.053 --> 01:52:07.578
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I just figured I would need one.

01:52:07.789 --> 01:52:09.689
So, Seth...

01:52:11.026 --> 01:52:14.985
So do you wanna come
buy me cover-up or something?

01:52:15.197 --> 01:52:17.222
I mean, you kind of owe me.

01:52:18.633 --> 01:52:22.000
Yeah, definitely.
I would love to do that.

01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:24.370
I had such bad acne last year...

01:52:24.573 --> 01:52:27.940
...that I pretty much became,
like, an expert on the stuff.

01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:31.104
Well, you drove.
Evan drove me here, though, so...

01:52:31.313 --> 01:52:33.338
Well, so...
Well, I mean, I have my dad's car.

01:52:33.548 --> 01:52:36.381
So I could just give you a lift...

01:52:36.585 --> 01:52:38.610
...and then Evan
could take Becca home.

01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:41.220
If that works.
I don't know if it's in your route.

01:52:41.423 --> 01:52:42.651
It'd be fine with me.

01:52:42.858 --> 01:52:45.622
Fine, yeah.
Maybe we can get some food.

01:52:46.828 --> 01:52:48.090
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:52:50.999 --> 01:52:52.660
So I guess I'll call you, then.

01:52:52.868 --> 01:52:54.859
Yeah, give me a call.
Yeah, you have my number.

01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:58.096
I have your information.
So put her there.

01:52:58.306 --> 01:53:01.275
Perfect. Good. All right, man.

01:53:01.476 --> 01:53:02.875
- Okay.
- Okay, guys.

01:53:03.078 --> 01:53:04.602
- Becca.
- Bye, guys.

01:53:04.813 --> 01:53:06.371
- Bye, have fun.
- See you, Jules.

01:53:06.581 --> 01:53:09.709
Yeah, that's funny. Too funny.

01:53:09.918 --> 01:53:12.409
Where do you wanna go to eat?

01:53:13.788 --> 01:53:17.053
So can you honestly help me figure out
what kind of cover-up to get?

01:58:24.432 --> 01:58:25.831
I love you.
