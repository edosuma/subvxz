00:13.518 --> 00:18.939
Mr President, the soldiers that attacked us
at the crash site, they were Americans.

00:19.023 --> 00:21.561
Their commander is a Colonel Samuels.

00:21.651 --> 00:24.901
Whoever attacked us
had access to our flight plan.

00:24.987 --> 00:29.199
The only way they could have gotten
that information was from the inside.

00:29.283 --> 00:35.286
Roger, tell me everything you know about
Colonel Ron Samuels from Fort Benning.

00:35.373 --> 00:37.365
I don't know anything about him.

00:37.458 --> 00:42.250
I just spoke to Roger Stanton. He's hiding
something from me. I'm going to arrest him.

00:42.338 --> 00:44.829
I wanted to warn you.
They know about OPCOM.

00:44.924 --> 00:46.798
- How?
- I told them.

00:46.884 --> 00:49.375
This way I get him trusting me again.

00:49.887 --> 00:53.719
If she would have known anything,
she would have told us. Kill her.

00:53.808 --> 00:56.133
You don't have to kill me.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.971
Can you identify any words that they said?

01:02.066 --> 01:04.522
Salat. It means "prayer".

01:04.610 --> 01:07.184
I want a list of every mosque
in a 15-mile radius.

01:07.280 --> 01:12.025
I don't know what Syed Ali looks like.
I need you to identify him for me.

01:12.118 --> 01:14.241
- Start a fire.
- You're crazy.

01:14.328 --> 01:18.741
Crazier than going to LA where
a nuclear bomb might go off any minute?

01:21.085 --> 01:23.872
There's been an accident.
We need an ambulance.

01:26.591 --> 01:29.960
- Somebody hacked in.
- Who else had access to it?

01:30.678 --> 01:34.972
- Marie?
- I didn't expect you to find anything.

03:22.707 --> 03:25.708
- Hello.
- Marie, we have a problem.

03:26.711 --> 03:28.371
What is it?

03:28.462 --> 03:31.748
Basheer and Marko are dead.
Omar has the van now.

03:31.841 --> 03:35.541
- What do you need me to do?
- They were supposed to pick up the trigger.

03:35.636 --> 03:39.504
- Where is it?
- At the place where Marko worked.

03:39.599 --> 03:43.050
In his locker. R & J Lumber in Burbank.

03:43.644 --> 03:47.476
- Is there a combination?
- No. It requires a key.

03:47.565 --> 03:53.983
You must do whatever you can to gain access
to this locker and bring the trigger to Omar.

03:54.071 --> 03:56.360
You want me to do this?

03:56.449 --> 04:01.526
Marie, our mission depends on you now.
I'm counting on you.

04:02.914 --> 04:04.990
I'll take care of it.

04:05.082 --> 04:08.582
- I know you will.
- I'll see you there.

04:08.669 --> 04:12.288
Marie, you should change your appearance.

04:12.381 --> 04:14.457
OK.

04:40.660 --> 04:45.238
At the mosque, all we need you
to do is identify Syed Ali.

04:45.331 --> 04:48.451
Then we'll transfer you back to CTU.

04:49.836 --> 04:52.291
- You OK?
- Yeah.

04:52.380 --> 04:56.128
I know how difficult this must be for you.

04:56.217 --> 04:58.506
Do you?

04:58.594 --> 05:04.015
It would really help me out a lot
if you could tell me what's going on.

05:04.100 --> 05:07.599
I'm not at liberty to tell you
any more than I already have.

05:07.687 --> 05:11.981
Your people took the liberty
of arresting my father.

05:12.066 --> 05:17.902
Syed Ali took the liberty of kidnapping me
and killing Paul Koplin in front of me.

05:17.989 --> 05:22.236
I think I've earned the right
to know what's going on.

05:22.326 --> 05:25.446
We believe Syed Ali
is at the centre of a terrorist attack

05:25.538 --> 05:28.989
that's gonna take place in Los Angeles today.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.788
What kind of terrorist attack?

05:32.837 --> 05:34.913
A nuclear bomb.

05:44.765 --> 05:47.766
You're the only person we know of
that's ever seen him.

05:47.852 --> 05:50.521
We need you to identify him for us.

05:50.605 --> 05:56.607
The reason why I'm taking you with me now
is because we're running out of time.

06:00.990 --> 06:03.481
- Jack Bauer.
- It's George.

06:03.576 --> 06:07.739
Baker should be on site any minute. I got
a hard perimeter set up around the mosque.

06:07.830 --> 06:10.748
I'll get back to you
as soon as we get there, George.

06:10.833 --> 06:15.080
Jack, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

06:15.171 --> 06:17.377
The Sheriffs Department at Newhall

06:17.465 --> 06:20.798
were transporting Kim
and they got into an accident.

06:20.885 --> 06:25.547
- What kind of accident?
- Don't worry. She didn't get hurt.

06:25.640 --> 06:30.052
What the hell was she doing with them?
Your people were supposed to pick her up.

06:30.144 --> 06:34.224
By the time our guys got to the station,
they'd already moved her.

06:34.315 --> 06:37.020
I guess some local deputy
was trying to be a big shot,

06:37.109 --> 06:39.482
claiming jurisdiction for a murder charge.

06:39.570 --> 06:42.357
Where is she now?

06:42.448 --> 06:44.820
She ran off after the accident.

06:44.909 --> 06:49.820
Maybe she was trying to avoid the local
police or trying not to get brought back to LA.

06:49.914 --> 06:54.659
Damm it, George. You told me you would
take care of this. You gave me your word.

06:54.752 --> 06:57.919
Please, please find my daughter.

06:58.005 --> 07:04.091
Jack, if it's any consolation,
she is outside the projected blast radius.

07:04.178 --> 07:06.669
Just find her, George.

07:09.725 --> 07:11.801
What was that about?

07:14.188 --> 07:16.596
My daughter.

07:16.691 --> 07:19.976
- Is she involved in this somehow?
- No.

07:21.404 --> 07:24.737
She's in some kind of trouble, though.

07:26.659 --> 07:30.823
I don't know yet. I hope not.

07:35.668 --> 07:37.376
Yes, I'll tell him.

07:37.461 --> 07:42.538
The consensus at Justice is that
the evidence against Stanton isn't actionable.

07:42.633 --> 07:46.085
How much more do they need?
We've established a direct link

07:46.179 --> 07:49.382
between him and the mercenaries
that shot down Bauer's plane.

07:49.473 --> 07:52.677
That connection is still circumstantial.

07:52.768 --> 07:56.268
He's been sabotaging our efforts
to find the bomb all day.

07:56.355 --> 07:59.807
I cannot and I will not allow him
to continue heading up NSA.

07:59.901 --> 08:03.898
I'm only saying it's going to take time
to get a judge to issue a warrant.

08:03.988 --> 08:07.689
- We don't have time, Mike.
- Then don't worry about a pretext.

08:07.783 --> 08:14.533
Take him out of play now and we'll deal
with the legal ramifications tomorrow.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.201
Sherry was right.

08:19.587 --> 08:22.339
My own people working against me.

08:24.842 --> 08:30.466
Stanton won't be easy to break.
Not in the time we have.

08:32.183 --> 08:38.683
We may need to expand the limits of how far
you've been willing to go in the past.

08:38.773 --> 08:40.647
What are you saying, Mike?

08:40.732 --> 08:47.400
That you do whatever it takes to find out
what Stanton knows about this bomb.

08:49.408 --> 08:51.899
I'm sorry. I can't disturb them right now.

08:51.994 --> 08:55.695
David only found out about
Stanton because of me,

08:55.790 --> 08:58.910
and it makes no sense
that he's keeping me out of the loop.

08:59.001 --> 09:01.409
I'm not sure what you think
I can do about that.

09:01.504 --> 09:05.371
Why don't you just tell me
what he's doing about Stanton?

09:05.466 --> 09:09.131
He hasn't let me in on it yet,
so I don't know what's been decided.

09:09.220 --> 09:12.304
Can't you find out?

09:12.390 --> 09:17.431
Mrs Palmer, if the president wanted input
from either of us, I'm sure he'd let us know.

09:17.520 --> 09:21.518
Lynne, you took credit
for my work on David's speech,

09:21.607 --> 09:24.098
and that was OK, I was fine with that.

09:24.193 --> 09:30.314
But right now my only interest
is to help David get through this day.

09:30.408 --> 09:33.574
I assume that's your priority as well?

09:33.661 --> 09:36.152
I'll see what I can do.

09:58.269 --> 10:00.178
- Miss Warner.
- She stays with me.

10:00.271 --> 10:03.936
We're good to go. I've got 30 men
ready to move on your order.

10:04.025 --> 10:09.150
- How many people in the mosque?
- 100 to 125, divided into target groups of 10.

10:09.238 --> 10:11.278
- We're not going in, not yet.
- Sir?

10:11.365 --> 10:17.984
We go in hot and it'll give Syed Ali time to
take his own life before Kate can identify him.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.995
- What's the alternative?
- We wait for the prayer service to end.

10:22.084 --> 10:26.296
He comes out, Kate identifies him,
then we'll take him out surgically.

10:26.380 --> 10:30.425
- Fast and alive. He's no good to us dead.
- What if someone spots us first?

10:30.510 --> 10:34.210
They phone Ali, we lose our surprise.
Assuming he's even inside.

10:34.305 --> 10:37.591
We're working on a weak hunch.
He might be at some other mosque.

10:37.683 --> 10:41.266
We're gonna have to take that chance.
We're waiting this out.

10:41.354 --> 10:45.601
I could go in. See if he's inside.

10:49.362 --> 10:52.647
I'll wear a hijab, hide my face.

10:52.740 --> 10:54.946
He wouldn't see me.

10:55.952 --> 10:59.866
I don't feel comfortable
putting you in that kind of a position.

10:59.956 --> 11:03.788
From what you've told me,
we're all in a pretty bad position.

11:03.876 --> 11:08.088
If I could help, I'd really like the chance.

11:14.804 --> 11:18.422
- You really think you can do this?
- Yeah.

11:20.935 --> 11:26.771
Get me the schematics to the mosque.
I'll look at the floor plan.

11:59.124 --> 12:02.706
- Everything's in place, Mr President.
- Do it.

12:02.794 --> 12:04.870
Let's move.

12:29.571 --> 12:31.113
What's going on, Mike?

12:31.197 --> 12:35.195
Mr Stanton, by order of the president,
I'm placing you under arrest

12:35.285 --> 12:39.781
for conspiracy to commit treason
against the United States of America.

12:39.873 --> 12:43.123
What the hell are you talking about?

12:45.795 --> 12:47.835
Hands off.

12:49.215 --> 12:51.885
I demand to speak to the president.

12:51.968 --> 12:55.468
I'm sure you'll get your chance, sir. Let's go.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.630
Come in.

13:40.475 --> 13:44.555
Sir, Mrs Palmer's been trying
to reach you for the last half-hour.

13:44.646 --> 13:46.888
Yes, I know.

13:46.982 --> 13:50.398
She's on line seven waiting right now.

13:50.485 --> 13:54.732
- I can put her off if you'd like.
- No, I'll take it.

13:55.782 --> 13:58.534
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

14:11.881 --> 14:14.373
- Yes, Sherry. What is it?
- David, thank God.

14:14.467 --> 14:19.129
I was just wondering
what you'd decided to do about Roger.

14:19.222 --> 14:21.844
I'm having him questioned.

14:21.933 --> 14:25.219
Has he admitted to ordering
Jack Bauer's plane shot down?

14:25.312 --> 14:26.391
Not yet.

14:26.479 --> 14:29.101
Then we don't know
any more than we did an hour ago.

14:29.190 --> 14:31.266
What is your point, Sherry?

14:31.359 --> 14:35.404
My point is I think you should have waited
for something more concrete.

14:35.488 --> 14:40.364
I don't run my decisions past you,
Sherry, not any more.

14:40.452 --> 14:45.363
A large part of the intelligence you're basing
your decisions on came from me.

14:45.457 --> 14:48.707
I think I've earned a seat at the table here.

14:48.793 --> 14:52.293
You're not a member of my staff.
You're not a government employee.

14:52.380 --> 14:55.999
- And you're not my wife.
- That was your decision, not mine.

14:56.092 --> 15:01.716
Sherry, whatever role you're playing
here today is on my terms, my timetable.

15:01.806 --> 15:05.674
Continue doing what you're doing.
I'll speak to you soon.

15:05.769 --> 15:07.845
But...

15:18.281 --> 15:21.816
We need one person that
we can coordinate with, not three.

15:21.910 --> 15:24.365
Yeah, we got that sorted out.

15:24.454 --> 15:29.531
You have him contact Jack Bauer.
He's running point for us.

15:31.795 --> 15:32.826
Hey.

15:33.964 --> 15:41.211
FBI. They want a representative at the
mosque, but they've got their wires crossed.

15:41.304 --> 15:44.341
Listen, what we were talking about before...

15:44.432 --> 15:49.853
Yeah, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
put you on the spot like that.

15:51.022 --> 15:54.723
No, actually, I'm glad you did.

15:56.278 --> 15:59.314
- You are?
- Yeah.

15:59.406 --> 16:04.648
There's been something hanging
between us since you started here.

16:04.744 --> 16:07.282
Yeah. Yeah, there has.

16:08.665 --> 16:16.162
I made a decision a while ago to try to keep
personal and professional stuff separate.

16:16.256 --> 16:18.332
But now I...

16:23.555 --> 16:24.337
Michelle Dessler.

16:24.431 --> 16:28.179
- Tell Almeida Warner's getting agitated.
- OK, I'll tell him.

16:28.268 --> 16:31.185
- There's a problem in room seven.
- Bob Warner?

16:31.271 --> 16:33.762
Yeah, he's getting violent.

16:40.113 --> 16:42.734
Get your hands off of me!

16:42.824 --> 16:44.900
You can't keep me here!

16:46.828 --> 16:48.987
- What's going on?
- He asked for water.

16:49.080 --> 16:52.284
- He bolted out the door.
- Why can't I see my lawyer?

16:52.375 --> 16:54.913
Sit him down. Calm down, Mr Warner!

16:55.003 --> 16:59.048
I won't calm down.
I want someone to start listening to me.

16:59.132 --> 17:01.884
I need you to calm down!

17:01.968 --> 17:04.720
Whatever Reza told you, he's lying.

17:04.804 --> 17:08.173
You are not helping your case here.
You understand me?

17:08.266 --> 17:14.601
You wanna have a conversation, or do you
want me to lock you up for the night?

17:19.778 --> 17:21.770
Where are my daughters?

17:21.863 --> 17:25.731
Marie left here five minutes
after Reza was taken to your office.

17:25.825 --> 17:27.901
What about Kate?

17:30.789 --> 17:34.407
What? Has something happened to Kate?

17:34.501 --> 17:36.826
She's with one of our agents.

17:36.920 --> 17:40.087
One of your agents? Why?

17:40.632 --> 17:43.668
You're gonna have to trust us, Mr Warner.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.844
She's gonna be fine, all right?

17:46.930 --> 17:48.922
Trust?

17:50.433 --> 17:53.802
This is where the men pray,
in front, closest to the entrance.

17:53.895 --> 17:58.890
You walk by them as you pass through here
down to the women's prayer area in the back.

17:58.984 --> 18:02.732
You've got one shot. Once you pass them,
their backs'll be to you.

18:02.821 --> 18:04.979
Get a clean look at the whole room.

18:05.073 --> 18:11.526
If you spot Ali, go past the women's prayer
area here, up here to this fire-exit door.

18:11.621 --> 18:16.330
We'll disable the alarm while you're inside.
We'll be waiting for you in the alley.

18:16.418 --> 18:18.576
- Are you clear?
- Yeah.

18:20.130 --> 18:23.795
- Are your men in place?
- Yeah.

18:23.883 --> 18:25.960
OK. Let's go.

18:36.187 --> 18:38.761
Kate, you sure about this?

18:39.608 --> 18:41.150
Yeah.

18:42.569 --> 18:44.645
OK. Take this.

18:46.531 --> 18:49.983
If Ali sees you, or you feel like
you're in danger, press that.

18:50.076 --> 18:56.957
It'll send a distress signal to my walkie-talkie
and we'll be in immediately.

18:57.042 --> 18:59.118
Be careful.

19:33.828 --> 19:36.154
She's in.

19:41.920 --> 19:48.041
- The prayers have already begun.
- I'm sorry I'm late. There was traffic.

19:48.134 --> 19:51.088
- Have you prayed with us before?
- Yes.

19:51.179 --> 19:54.513
It's been a while, though. I've been away.

21:25.941 --> 21:28.977
It's Jack. You're all right.

21:29.069 --> 21:32.402
He's in there. Syed Ali. He's in there.

21:45.186 --> 21:47.344
Stanton's last call was to Virginia.

21:47.438 --> 21:50.355
He wasn't on long enough
to get a complete number,

21:50.441 --> 21:54.059
but we know it's a Langley prefix.

21:55.071 --> 21:56.399
CIA.

21:58.574 --> 22:00.650
Sergeant.

22:10.753 --> 22:12.829
Sit down.

22:21.889 --> 22:24.380
We have it all, Roger.

22:27.061 --> 22:31.308
You reactivated OPCOM
with an eyes-only order.

22:32.108 --> 22:38.442
You used it to communicate with Colonel
Samuels as recently as two hours ago.

22:39.490 --> 22:45.493
And we've connected Samuels directly to
the mercenaries that tried to kill Jack Bauer.

22:45.579 --> 22:52.033
I don't know, Roger. It almost seems
as if you want this bomb to go off today.

22:54.463 --> 23:01.261
But I'll tell you this: if people die,
Roger, you'll be executed.

23:02.388 --> 23:10.052
And even if we find the bomb in time, you'll
still get life without the possibility of parole.

23:11.272 --> 23:16.859
But all I want... is to find the bomb in time.

23:20.781 --> 23:23.486
That's why I have a deal for you.

23:25.244 --> 23:30.867
You tell me everything -
I mean everything - and I'll bury this.

23:33.002 --> 23:36.003
You resign, due to health reasons.

23:37.256 --> 23:39.712
You'll collect your pension.

23:39.800 --> 23:45.008
You'll retire in a nice house,
somewhere in the country.

23:45.097 --> 23:48.513
You'll be given a written grant of immunity.

23:50.436 --> 23:54.481
And nobody will ever know
anything about this.

23:57.860 --> 23:59.936
Do we have a deal?

24:13.959 --> 24:19.120
I don't know what
you're talking about, Mr President.

24:19.215 --> 24:22.880
I've done nothing wrong.

24:22.968 --> 24:27.013
I don't know any more
about the bomb than you do.

24:45.074 --> 24:47.909
I want you to cover
these two back exits from the alley.

24:47.994 --> 24:50.864
We're looking for
a Middle Eastern man, late 30s.

24:50.955 --> 24:53.790
Black shirt, silver buttons, black pants.

24:53.874 --> 24:56.412
Miss Warner and I will
cover the main entrance.

24:56.502 --> 25:00.749
As soon as the crowd starts
to leave the building, she'll identify Ali.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.378
I'll inform Agent Baker. He will give the go.

25:03.467 --> 25:08.213
No one moves before that happens.
If you fire your weapon, shoot to wound only.

25:08.305 --> 25:11.509
We're looking at 19 minutes
before the service is over.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.266
Is everybody clear?
We cannot afford any mistakes here.

25:15.354 --> 25:17.430
OK. Let's go.

25:36.667 --> 25:39.454
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.

25:49.680 --> 25:53.512
Control the focus with the centre dial here.

26:04.070 --> 26:11.282
What you did for us in the mosque, I thought
it was really courageous. Thank you.

26:11.369 --> 26:14.951
You're kidding me. I'm still shaking.

26:15.039 --> 26:17.364
You did great.

26:21.545 --> 26:25.164
The prayer service lets out in 17 minutes.

29:05.836 --> 29:09.536
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Thanks for keeping this discreet.

29:09.631 --> 29:11.423
Of course.

29:11.508 --> 29:14.379
Ted, how long have you been
with the Secret Service?

29:14.469 --> 29:16.758
Five and a half years, sir.

29:18.223 --> 29:21.473
I understand you have
a background in Special Ops.

29:21.560 --> 29:25.937
Green Berets, sir.
Unit seven out of Fort Myers, '87.

29:26.023 --> 29:29.890
- Ever put your training to use?
- The Gulf, sir.

29:29.985 --> 29:32.820
Anywhere else?

29:32.904 --> 29:36.108
There were some other... covert ops.

29:39.161 --> 29:42.078
Under the directorate at the CIA?

29:45.292 --> 29:48.708
It's all right, Ted. I'm not on a witch-hunt here.

29:48.795 --> 29:52.247
But I do need you to answer the question.

29:52.341 --> 29:55.425
Yes, sir. For the CIA.

29:56.303 --> 30:01.510
Good. You understand
the gravity of today's situation?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.842
Of course, sir.

30:03.935 --> 30:08.977
I guess you've heard that Roger Stanton's
no longer functioning as the head of NSA.

30:09.066 --> 30:14.024
- I heard he was arrested.
- He was, under my authority.

30:16.782 --> 30:21.490
What I'm about to ask you to do falls outside
the parameters of your Secret Service charge.

30:21.578 --> 30:26.620
You won't be able to tell anyone
about this without my direct consent.

30:26.708 --> 30:29.330
Are you still with me, Ted?

30:29.419 --> 30:31.626
What would you like me to do, sir?

30:34.007 --> 30:37.625
Extract information from Roger Stanton.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.340
I see.

30:41.431 --> 30:46.592
If he resists, how far am I permitted to go?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.722
Whatever you need to do.

30:54.236 --> 30:56.312
Yes, sir.

31:05.038 --> 31:10.033
Tony. Richards and Maccabee were shot.
So was Reza Naiyeer. They're all dead.

31:10.127 --> 31:12.119
- What?
- A janitor found their bodies.

31:12.212 --> 31:14.881
I just got off the phone with the LAPD.

31:14.965 --> 31:17.041
Are there any suspects?

31:18.260 --> 31:22.174
Last time I talked to Maccabee,
she said that Marie Warner had just got there.

31:22.264 --> 31:24.636
She wanted to talk to Reza.

31:24.725 --> 31:27.809
Marie Warner?
She was there during the shootings?

31:27.894 --> 31:34.146
Security cameras show she was the only one
to leave the building in the last 40 minutes.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.197
- Bauer.
- It's Tony.

31:47.289 --> 31:51.951
- How's it going over there?
- We got about 10 minutes.

31:52.044 --> 31:54.914
- Are you still with Kate Warner?
- Yes, I am.

31:55.005 --> 31:59.216
I got some information, but you need
to keep this conversation one-sided.

31:59.301 --> 32:01.792
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

32:03.889 --> 32:10.057
Richards and Maccabee have been
shot and killed. So was Reza Naiyeer.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.604
Uh-huh.

32:11.688 --> 32:15.472
We have strong evidence
that Marie Warner was the shooter.

32:17.694 --> 32:19.901
Yeah, I understand.

32:19.988 --> 32:26.358
Has Kate Warner been contacted
by anybody in the last half-hour?

32:26.453 --> 32:29.122
No, she's been with me the entire time.

32:29.206 --> 32:30.237
Jack,

32:30.332 --> 32:33.037
I think you have to
treat her as an unknown.

32:33.126 --> 32:36.330
For all we know,
she's working with her sister.

32:36.421 --> 32:41.214
I don't think so. Ali's men would've
killed her if we hadn't shown up.

32:41.301 --> 32:45.346
If Kate's sister's part of this,
or if she's one of the terrorists,

32:45.430 --> 32:48.467
I really don't think Kate knows about it.

32:48.558 --> 32:53.220
Jack, that's your call.
I just wanted to give you the information.

32:53.313 --> 32:54.807
OK, thanks.

32:57.442 --> 32:59.518
Was that your office?

33:00.862 --> 33:02.772
Yeah.

33:02.864 --> 33:06.648
- Are they still holding my dad?
- Yes, your dad's safe.

33:06.743 --> 33:10.408
What about my sister? Is she OK?
Has anyone heard from her?

33:10.497 --> 33:12.454
I don't think so.

33:46.533 --> 33:50.198
Excuse me. Bill told me
you're the guy in charge.

33:50.287 --> 33:51.781
I'm the foreman.

33:51.872 --> 33:56.332
I need a favour. I need to get something
out of my boyfriend's locker.

33:56.418 --> 33:59.538
- Your boyfriend?
- Marko Ashami.

34:00.630 --> 34:04.711
- You go out with Marko?
- I did. We got into a fight last night.

34:04.801 --> 34:08.965
It's a long story, but the point of it is
we're not going out any more.

34:09.056 --> 34:12.674
- That why he didn't show up for work today?
- I guess.

34:12.768 --> 34:15.259
It was a pretty bad fight.

34:16.438 --> 34:20.685
And he's got something
in his locker that belongs to me.

34:20.775 --> 34:24.820
I can't go opening people's lockers.
You'll have to work it out with Marko.

34:24.905 --> 34:30.147
I don't know how well you know Marko, but if
I could've worked it out, I wouldn't be asking.

34:30.243 --> 34:33.031
Please. It's really important.

34:34.121 --> 34:36.612
I'm sorry. I can't.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.286
Can't or won't?

34:46.467 --> 34:49.255
I'd really show my appreciation.

34:52.766 --> 34:54.889
And I'd show it to you first.

34:58.647 --> 35:00.853
What do you mean?

35:00.941 --> 35:04.392
- Is this your office?
- Yeah.

35:04.486 --> 35:06.692
Does it have a lock?

35:35.393 --> 35:40.435
Time is of the essence, Mr Stanton.
Intensity and duration of the electrical current

35:40.524 --> 35:45.766
will increase substantially
each time I repeat a question.

35:45.862 --> 35:48.353
Yes, I know the drill, Agent Simmons.

35:48.448 --> 35:53.443
What is your agenda, Mr Stanton,
and who else is involved?

36:09.678 --> 36:15.930
Who else knew about the bomb, Mr Stanton?
Who have you been working with?

36:17.060 --> 36:20.476
I don't know anything about the bomb.

36:25.694 --> 36:27.936
Who are you working with, Mr Stanton?

36:36.079 --> 36:39.911
Please, Mr Almeida, just tell me
what is going on with my daughter Kate.

36:40.000 --> 36:46.252
- I already told you, Mr Warner. She's fine.
- What is she doing with one of your agents?

36:49.426 --> 36:51.917
Reza Naiyeer is dead.

36:54.514 --> 36:56.590
Oh, God.

36:57.726 --> 37:04.393
We just found out. He and two of our agents
were shot and killed at your office.

37:13.116 --> 37:16.200
What about Marie? Is she OK?

37:17.621 --> 37:20.112
Please tell me Marie is OK.

37:22.334 --> 37:24.540
Look...

37:24.628 --> 37:29.005
I'm sorry to have to
tell you this, Mr Warner,

37:29.090 --> 37:32.922
but we believe Marie committed the murders.

37:41.353 --> 37:45.600
It's a trick. I know it's a trick.
You're trying to trick me.

37:59.204 --> 38:00.947
Here they come.

38:01.039 --> 38:04.788
All teams, be alert. They're coming out now.

38:11.508 --> 38:13.999
- Can you see him yet?
- No.

38:16.012 --> 38:19.428
- Wait a minute.
- Is that him?

38:20.934 --> 38:23.306
It could be the one behind those three men.

38:23.395 --> 38:26.182
Just take your time, Kate. Be sure.

38:26.982 --> 38:29.473
I can't see his face.

38:41.913 --> 38:43.989
No, it's not him.

38:51.339 --> 38:53.712
I don't see him. I don't see him!

38:53.800 --> 38:57.335
Keep looking. He's gotta be in the crowd.

39:00.640 --> 39:03.974
There's the greeter.
Normally he'd be the last one out.

39:04.060 --> 39:06.551
Damm it. Anything on the back exits?

39:06.646 --> 39:09.683
- Negative. No one's gone in or out.
- Damm it!

39:09.774 --> 39:12.811
Kate, you would tell me
if you saw him, right?

39:12.903 --> 39:15.903
Of course I would. What do you mean?

39:17.532 --> 39:21.862
Why are you looking at me like that,
as if I'm suspicious? I didn't see him!

39:21.953 --> 39:26.449
Just relax. He must have made you
when you were inside the mosque.

39:26.541 --> 39:32.745
Agent Baker, he didn't come outside.
Give the word to go. Secure the building.

39:32.839 --> 39:35.876
Open the gate.

39:35.967 --> 39:38.043
Go! Go!

39:40.096 --> 39:44.758
- What's going on?
- Federal agent. I've got a warrant.

39:50.190 --> 39:54.484
- I am the imam here. What's going on?
- Calm down, sir. We're federal agents.

39:54.569 --> 39:58.614
We received positive identification
of an international terrorist here.

39:58.698 --> 40:01.699
- We need to find him now.
- Do you have a search warrant?

40:01.785 --> 40:03.861
Yes, I do, sir.

40:05.455 --> 40:08.954
Get back here. Keep her against the wall.

40:09.042 --> 40:11.747
- Can you see anything?
- Clear.

40:18.385 --> 40:20.461
Damm it!

40:29.229 --> 40:31.802
Put the blanket on him!

40:45.078 --> 40:48.577
The clothes match the description.

40:48.665 --> 40:52.200
Teams A and B maintain positions.
We've got Ali.

40:53.128 --> 40:55.749
- He's dead, Jack.
- Son of a bitch!

40:57.174 --> 40:59.665
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

41:01.845 --> 41:05.130
- CTU.
- This is Jack Bauer. Get Mason on the line.

41:05.223 --> 41:07.299
Ali has killed himself.

41:32.209 --> 41:34.996
I'm gonna have to get back to you.

41:38.924 --> 41:42.257
These clothes don't belong to this man.

41:42.344 --> 41:46.176
Look at the pants.
They're three inches too short.

41:46.264 --> 41:52.634
Maintain secure exits. Ali is still in the
building. Repeat: Ali is still in the building.
