What is that,
three in a row?

00:13.937 --> 00:15.838
That would be four,
actually.

00:15.905 --> 00:17.206
- Oh, God.
- Come on.

00:17.273 --> 00:18.607
What do you say,
we go five outta nine?

00:18.675 --> 00:20.709
So you can keep abusing me?
No, thank you.

00:20.777 --> 00:21.939
- I'm done.
- Oh, come on.

00:22.006 --> 00:23.302
I'll spot you three.

00:23.370 --> 00:24.619
Game time's over, Wyatt.
They're here.

00:24.687 --> 00:25.859
They're here?

00:25.927 --> 00:27.322
You can set up
in the conference room.

00:27.390 --> 00:28.691
Yeah.
No, I'm just...

00:28.759 --> 00:32.756
Get set up in
the conference room.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.056
- You did let him win, right?
- It wasn't easy.

00:35.124 --> 00:36.990
The guy has the coordination
of a two-year-old.

00:37.058 --> 00:39.490
I know, the last time these
venture capitalists came in,

00:39.557 --> 00:41.025
I took him boxing to
calm him down.

00:41.092 --> 00:43.225
I basically had to punch myself
in the face to let him win.

00:45.060 --> 00:46.894
I don't get it.
I mean, if he's such a genius,

00:46.962 --> 00:48.832
why does he get so nervous
around a bunch of investors?

00:48.899 --> 00:50.870
Eh, you spend
two years working on

00:50.937 --> 00:52.338
a satellite phone
that fits in your pocket

00:52.405 --> 00:53.606
and then bet
the company on it.

00:53.674 --> 00:55.411
You'd be a little
nervous too, I think.

00:55.479 --> 00:57.280
The prototype...

00:57.348 --> 00:59.216
I can't find it.
I don't know where I--

00:59.284 --> 01:01.187
You mean this?

01:01.255 --> 01:02.591
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

01:02.658 --> 01:05.093
- Fail miserably.
- I would.

01:05.161 --> 01:07.799
- Is that the...
- $20 million prototype, yes.

01:07.867 --> 01:09.435
And you don't even
get to look at this bad boy

01:09.502 --> 01:11.204
until after
we close the deal today.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.441
Wow, they're
like storm troopers.

01:13.509 --> 01:15.943
Storm troopers
don't write checks.

01:16.011 --> 01:17.813
Now all you gotta do
is walk in there,

01:17.881 --> 01:19.281
show them
how the phone works...

01:19.349 --> 01:22.487
Right, and Suntech Digital
will be a new force

01:22.554 --> 01:24.656
in global communications.
Let's knock 'em dead.

01:26.759 --> 01:29.396
All right.

01:29.463 --> 01:30.965
Wait, wait.
Where do you think you're going?

01:31.032 --> 01:32.967
Into the room
with the people.

01:33.034 --> 01:35.538
Wrong, that's
the adult table in there.

01:35.605 --> 01:37.273
And you haven't
earned the privilege yet.

01:37.341 --> 01:38.742
But I played
air hockey with him--

01:38.810 --> 01:39.977
You need to
go back to the office

01:40.045 --> 01:41.345
and file
a patent for the phone.

01:41.413 --> 01:43.347
A patent? I don't
know how to file a patent.

01:43.415 --> 01:45.182
- Figure it out.
- Can't we do that after--

01:45.250 --> 01:47.184
No, and you keep talking,
I'm gonna start billing you.

01:47.252 --> 01:48.886
And my time
runs $1,000 an hour.

01:48.953 --> 01:50.854
But isn't this our time,
Mr. Hand?

01:52.991 --> 01:54.425
I stand corrected.

01:54.493 --> 01:56.127
<i>Your Fast Times</i>
<i>at Ridgemont High</i> quote,

01:56.194 --> 01:58.862
that proves you
belong at the adult table.

01:58.930 --> 02:01.198
Hey,
that's a great movie.

02:01.265 --> 02:02.932
And it spoke
to a generation...

02:13.480 --> 02:16.349
Hey, you busy?

02:19.987 --> 02:22.156
Okay, have you
ever filed a patent before?

02:22.224 --> 02:23.724
I just got back from
this meeting with Harvey

02:23.792 --> 02:25.092
and he wants me
to file this patent,

02:25.160 --> 02:27.027
but I have no idea what
that paperwork looks like.

02:27.095 --> 02:29.964
So...any help in
this arena would be re--

02:32.300 --> 02:33.734
Did Harvey call you
and tell you to do that?

02:43.410 --> 02:45.544
If it isn't the golden boy.

02:45.612 --> 02:47.680
You're Harvey's
project, right?

02:47.748 --> 02:50.250
What's your name?
Mike, Mike Ross.

02:50.318 --> 02:51.685
Gregory Boone.

02:51.753 --> 02:53.387
So what are you doing here?

02:53.455 --> 02:56.424
Weren't you signing some big
deal this afternoon downtown?

02:56.492 --> 02:58.594
Well, evidently I haven't
earned the privilege yet.

02:58.661 --> 02:59.862
Get the adult table speech?

03:03.300 --> 03:05.000
Yeah, instead of
watching the deal close,

03:05.068 --> 03:07.003
I get to file the patent.

03:07.070 --> 03:08.904
Yeah, those suck.

03:10.707 --> 03:13.242
Wait, you--you've done
one of these before?

03:13.310 --> 03:15.411
Like 100.
Why?

03:20.250 --> 03:21.950
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.353
Now.

03:25.421 --> 03:27.289
It's okay,
you don't have to apologize.

03:27.356 --> 03:29.057
I took care of it.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.593
Patent claim.

03:30.660 --> 03:32.161
I negotiated a deal
to get it done.

03:32.229 --> 03:33.429
What are you talking about?

03:33.497 --> 03:35.599
Gregory.
He agreed to file it for me.

03:35.666 --> 03:37.701
And all I have to do is
proof his Bainbridge briefs.

03:37.768 --> 03:40.504
Ah. That explains
why he said to give you this.

03:42.941 --> 03:44.542
And why he called you a sucker.

03:46.311 --> 03:47.445
He called me a what now?

03:49.982 --> 03:54.386
Mike Ross, allow me to
introduce the Bainbridge briefs.

03:54.454 --> 03:57.757
- Which stack?
- All of them.

03:57.824 --> 03:59.192
Wait a minute,
are these all--

03:59.259 --> 04:01.194
Still printing, yeah.
I'd give it about a half hour.

04:01.262 --> 04:05.132
Um...that's six printers,
23 pages a minute, 30 minutes.

04:05.199 --> 04:08.836
That's 4,140 pages.
Plus all this.

04:08.903 --> 04:10.905
Which means the next time
you negotiate a deal,

04:10.972 --> 04:12.740
I would suggest
to get your facts straight.

04:12.808 --> 04:15.410
Uh...
I am a sucker.

04:15.478 --> 04:17.779
Mm-hmm.

04:17.846 --> 04:20.015
When did that happen?

Nice of you
to join us this morning.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.529
For your information,
Mr. Sunshine,

04:56.596 --> 04:57.830
I've been here
all night proofing.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.198
That belongs to--
okay.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.766
Where's my confirmation?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.434
What?

05:02.857 --> 05:04.958
The fact that you don't know
already concerns me.

05:05.026 --> 05:06.593
Oh, you mean
the patent thing?

05:06.660 --> 05:09.229
"The patent thing"
is the only piece of paper

05:09.296 --> 05:10.596
that's holding up
our deal from yesterday.

05:11.965 --> 05:13.099
Where is it?

05:13.166 --> 05:14.667
It's on my desk.

05:14.735 --> 05:16.335
Well, if it's not on mine
by the time I get back,

05:16.403 --> 05:18.070
I'm gonna feed you to Louis.

05:19.306 --> 05:22.141
No problem.

05:27.681 --> 05:29.115
Please tell me
that you filed that--

05:29.183 --> 05:30.650
Patent?
No, not yet.

05:30.717 --> 05:32.118
I gave it to you yesterday.

05:32.186 --> 05:33.619
At the same time
I gave you my Bainbridge briefs,

05:33.687 --> 05:35.020
which you haven't finished.

05:35.088 --> 05:37.023
I was here all night,
and I barely got through half.

05:37.090 --> 05:38.657
And I was on hold
for almost 11 minutes

05:38.725 --> 05:40.960
before I gave up on your patent,
so what's your point?

05:41.028 --> 05:42.561
I swear I will
finish those filings,

05:42.629 --> 05:43.863
but you have to give me
this patent confirmation

05:43.930 --> 05:45.131
before Harvey gets back.

05:45.198 --> 05:48.501
Sorry, golden boy.
Deal's a deal.

06:05.418 --> 06:08.320
What do you
think you're doing?

06:08.388 --> 06:11.490
Uh...I'm proofing briefs.
Why?

06:11.558 --> 06:13.192
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, there is.

06:13.260 --> 06:15.228
That's Gregory's responsibility,
why are you handling it?

06:15.295 --> 06:18.297
Oh, I...volunteered.

06:18.365 --> 06:20.232
He didn't pawn it off on you?

06:20.300 --> 06:22.535
- No.
- No.

06:22.603 --> 06:24.570
I mean, he didn't
even want me to do it,

06:24.638 --> 06:27.940
but you know,
I-I-I had some extra time.

06:28.008 --> 06:30.810
So I insisted.

06:35.850 --> 06:38.118
Congratulations.

06:38.186 --> 06:40.488
You've shown loyalty
to your fellow associates.

06:40.556 --> 06:42.857
I know Gregory tricked you
into doing his work.

06:42.925 --> 06:44.759
I wanted to see how you react
when pressed about it.

06:44.827 --> 06:46.861
You held up.

06:46.929 --> 06:48.563
I respect that.

06:48.631 --> 06:50.298
Thanks?

06:50.366 --> 06:51.499
See, but I don't
understand something now.

06:51.567 --> 06:52.768
If you didn't know how
to file a patent,

06:52.835 --> 06:54.470
then why didn't
you just run to Harvey?

06:56.439 --> 06:58.874
He was busy.

06:58.942 --> 07:00.709
But you see, Mike,
that's why you come to see me.

07:03.946 --> 07:09.852
Look, Mike, I know...
I can come across a bit...

07:09.920 --> 07:12.421
Prickly.

07:12.489 --> 07:13.656
But we're a team here.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.626
That means I'm here to help.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.632
Okay, all right.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.900
So can you help me now?

07:25.004 --> 07:28.640
I already have.

07:28.707 --> 07:30.275
Are--

07:30.342 --> 07:33.178
thank you, Louis.

07:38.185 --> 07:40.687
Donna, blue is your color.

07:40.754 --> 07:42.355
Is Harvey back?

07:42.423 --> 07:44.391
No.
Can I put this on his desk?

07:44.458 --> 07:46.293
Yes.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.461
Will you tell him
I put it there hours ago?

07:48.529 --> 07:52.332
What time
you want me to say?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.434
- 11:00 am?
- Absolutely.

07:55.970 --> 07:58.038
And then maybe I can use
my access to his bank accounts.

07:58.105 --> 08:01.408
To buy myself
a house in the Hamptons.

08:01.475 --> 08:02.375
- 12:15?
- No.

08:11.085 --> 08:13.819
You wanted to see me?

08:17.591 --> 08:20.426
Sit down.

08:25.733 --> 08:27.601
I looked through your work on
the Bainbridge briefs.

08:33.107 --> 08:34.842
Spectacular.

08:37.044 --> 08:38.346
You caught the discrepancies

08:38.414 --> 08:40.081
between listed assets and
potential assets.

08:40.149 --> 08:41.416
That had a huge impact, Mike.

08:41.484 --> 08:43.284
Yeah, I know.
Millions.

08:43.352 --> 08:45.721
But anyone
would've caught that, right?

08:45.788 --> 08:48.356
Um, out of the 50 associates
that are under purview,

08:48.424 --> 08:49.791
not one of them
would've caught that.

08:49.859 --> 08:51.793
You just have
this eye for detail, Mike.

08:51.861 --> 08:53.628
I mean, no wonder
Harvey's so crazy about you.

08:53.696 --> 08:54.796
It's amazing.
I mean, I really,

08:54.864 --> 08:56.464
really, seriously
appreciate that.

08:56.532 --> 09:00.267
Hey,
thank you, Louis.

09:00.335 --> 09:01.369
That's nice.

09:01.436 --> 09:03.404
You know that I pick a...

09:03.471 --> 09:05.139
Pony out of the herd
every year, don't you?

09:05.207 --> 09:07.241
- A pony?
- Oh, yeah.

09:07.309 --> 09:08.910
Someone who shows potential.

09:08.978 --> 09:10.712
Stamp my own little
brand on him.

09:10.780 --> 09:12.247
Mm.

09:12.314 --> 09:13.582
Are you that pony, Mike?

09:18.721 --> 09:21.690
I...work for Harvey.

09:21.758 --> 09:22.891
As you should.

09:22.959 --> 09:24.660
Good.

09:24.728 --> 09:26.062
Well, listen,
I have some work to get to.

09:26.129 --> 09:29.365
So maybe we can meet
for lunch tomorrow at the club.

09:29.432 --> 09:31.500
- Say, 1:00pm?
- Uh, you know, tomorrow...

09:31.568 --> 09:32.835
I know I just
posed that as a question,

09:32.903 --> 09:33.803
but I really
didn't mean it that way.

09:39.177 --> 09:43.247
Hey, what's up?

09:43.315 --> 09:45.216
We just heard from Wyatt.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.251
He got a response
from the Patent Office.

09:47.319 --> 09:49.753
And?

09:49.821 --> 09:50.787
It's been denied.

09:50.855 --> 09:52.156
What?

09:52.223 --> 09:54.391
Evidently, there was
a similar claim.

09:54.459 --> 09:56.326
Wait, what do you mean?
Somebody beat us to it?

09:56.394 --> 09:58.495
No, someone beat you to it.

09:58.562 --> 10:00.696
They filed
less than 24 hours ago,

10:00.764 --> 10:03.766
which means you filed a day
later than you said you would.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.268
I tried to tell you that
I didn't know how to do that.

10:05.336 --> 10:06.469
And I told you to
figure it out.

10:06.537 --> 10:08.204
And I did, and it got filed.

10:08.272 --> 10:10.874
After you lied and said
you'd already followed through.

10:14.646 --> 10:17.314
Okay,
what's gonna happen now?

10:17.382 --> 10:18.916
I suggest
you get on the phone,

10:18.984 --> 10:21.318
call the Patent Office,
and find out who beat us to it.

10:21.386 --> 10:23.888
Then you're gonna have Donna
find any judge who will listen,

10:23.955 --> 10:25.423
so we can get an injunction,

10:25.490 --> 10:27.458
and stop whoever it is from
launching their product first.

10:27.526 --> 10:28.960
Okay, got it.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.395
Now I've gotta call Wyatt
and calm him down.

10:30.462 --> 10:32.196
You think that's
gonna be a walk in the park?

10:34.533 --> 10:37.301
Hey, Harvey...

10:37.369 --> 10:39.670
Did you tell him it was me?

10:39.738 --> 10:42.439
Why would I do that?
I'm responsible for you.

10:42.507 --> 10:44.742
It was me.

11:05.564 --> 11:07.498
They signed
the paperwork, Wyatt.

11:07.565 --> 11:08.999
They can't pull out.

11:09.067 --> 11:11.568
The patent dispute
is not an issue, okay?

11:11.636 --> 11:14.270
No, they cut the check.
End of story.

11:14.338 --> 11:18.073
I'm in court right now,
let me call you back.

11:18.141 --> 11:19.975
So it's
Velocity Data Solutions.

11:20.043 --> 11:21.710
Did you serve them
with notice of the hearing?

11:21.778 --> 11:23.378
A billion dollar company.

11:23.446 --> 11:26.214
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.850
Did you not
see the sign outside?

11:29.918 --> 11:31.719
I'm just putting it away,
your honor.

11:31.787 --> 11:32.887
It should already be
in your pocket.

11:32.955 --> 11:34.622
But you were
already running late,

11:34.690 --> 11:36.757
so perhaps
that's why it wasn't.

11:36.825 --> 11:39.627
Let the records show that
the counsel is fined $1,000

11:39.694 --> 11:41.328
for failing to follow
the posted rules of the court.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.397
- Your honor, I didn't mean--
- And for mouthing off.

11:43.465 --> 11:44.999
Mouthing off?

11:45.067 --> 11:48.403
Another outburst like that,
and you will be escorted out.

11:50.373 --> 11:51.406
Wow.

11:53.610 --> 11:55.711
Mr. Salinger?

11:55.779 --> 11:57.313
Your honor,
this is a waste of your time.

11:57.381 --> 11:59.749
The U.S. Patent Office
is the only judicial body

11:59.817 --> 12:01.985
that should be
handling this dispute.

12:02.053 --> 12:05.189
Velocity Data Solutions
requests dismissal.

12:05.257 --> 12:08.526
Your honor.
If I may?

12:10.061 --> 12:12.462
- This injunction request--
- Counsel approach.

12:20.637 --> 12:22.305
That's the exhibit filing?

12:24.073 --> 12:25.807
Why wasn't I
given a courtesy copy?

12:25.875 --> 12:28.143
Given the expedited nature
of this hearing, I--

12:28.211 --> 12:29.478
Hand it to me.
Hand it to me.

12:37.521 --> 12:39.422
And I would've assumed
that a lawyer

12:39.489 --> 12:41.357
appearing before
a judge would come on time,

12:41.425 --> 12:44.794
with his mouth shut, and
prepared with a courtesy brief.

12:47.465 --> 12:49.733
- My apologies.
- Request denied.

12:49.801 --> 12:53.270
Court adjourned for morning.

12:53.338 --> 12:55.039
Better luck
next time, Harvey.

12:58.777 --> 13:01.546
From now on, I want him
when I go against you.

13:05.651 --> 13:07.085
Wait here.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.857
- Your honor, I have--
- Send him in.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.404
Counselor?

13:25.471 --> 13:27.572
You asked to see me.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.141
You must
have something to say.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.176
Excluding
friends, associates,

13:31.244 --> 13:32.478
and the clients
that I represent,

13:32.546 --> 13:33.679
there are very few people

13:33.747 --> 13:35.248
that I'm on
a first name basis with.

13:35.316 --> 13:36.816
And I've never had anyone,

13:36.883 --> 13:40.186
let alone
a judge I've never met,

13:40.254 --> 13:42.855
address me as Harvey
in open court.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.323
But if you're gonna screw me,

13:44.391 --> 13:47.694
I guess it's only fair
that you call me by name.

13:47.761 --> 13:48.895
I could have
you brought up on review

13:48.963 --> 13:50.163
for talking to me like that.

13:50.231 --> 13:52.265
Then we can
get it all on record.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.535
- Get what?
- Whatever it is

13:54.602 --> 13:56.971
that you seem to have against me
for no apparent reason.

13:57.038 --> 13:59.674
I have a solid argument for
any reasonable judge

13:59.741 --> 14:02.544
to grant my injunction.
So solid it begs the question,

14:02.611 --> 14:04.546
why do you have it in for me?

14:04.613 --> 14:06.314
And I don't even know
your first name.

14:06.382 --> 14:08.183
Really?

14:08.250 --> 14:10.685
- My wife never mentioned it?
- Your wife?

14:10.752 --> 14:12.953
The woman you had
an affair with last month?

14:17.212 --> 14:18.345
Hey wait, what happened in there?

14:18.413 --> 14:20.213
Donna, the address for
that fundraiser

14:20.281 --> 14:21.614
at the gallery last month,

14:21.682 --> 14:23.917
I need you to text it to me,
and clear my afternoon.

14:25.987 --> 14:27.688
Hey, where are we going?

14:27.755 --> 14:29.222
You're going back
to the office to file

14:29.290 --> 14:31.826
an interference claim
with the Patent Office.

14:31.894 --> 14:33.361
Okay.
Wait, what's that?

14:33.429 --> 14:35.998
It's how they determine
who wins these situations.

14:36.065 --> 14:38.200
It's not always who filed first,
so we have a chance.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.401
So why didn't we
do that in the first place?

14:39.469 --> 14:40.770
Because it takes longer,

14:40.837 --> 14:43.039
and I wanted to head
Velocity off at the pass.

14:43.107 --> 14:44.207
Hey, where you going?

14:44.275 --> 14:46.109
To iron out a wrinkle.

14:52.082 --> 14:54.817
If you're really interested,
come back tomorrow around 1:00.

14:54.885 --> 14:57.754
The afternoon light really
makes this canvas come alive.

14:57.821 --> 15:00.823
Pardon me, I was wondering,
would I get a discount

15:00.891 --> 15:02.925
for being the guy you
cheated on your husband with?

15:05.028 --> 15:06.428
Can you
excuse me for a second?

15:09.299 --> 15:10.766
What are you doing here?

15:10.834 --> 15:12.936
I had a hearing in front of
the judge this morning,

15:13.003 --> 15:14.471
it didn't go very well.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.807
- Why did you lie to him?
- I'm sorry.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.575
I mean, I recall
you being tipsy that night,

15:18.643 --> 15:20.110
but I'm finding it
hard to believe

15:20.178 --> 15:21.945
that your memory is so cloudy,

15:22.013 --> 15:23.280
you forgot
I sent you home in a cab.

15:23.347 --> 15:24.615
After humiliating me.

15:24.682 --> 15:26.116
I was the perfect gentleman.

15:26.184 --> 15:27.584
Yes, exactly.

15:27.652 --> 15:30.020
I fall all over myself
making a pass,

15:30.088 --> 15:32.389
and you do the right thing
and send me home.

15:32.456 --> 15:34.057
I'm sorry
you felt humiliated,

15:34.125 --> 15:35.992
but I told you, I don't
sleep with married women.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.662
Right.
The moral code.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.898
No. It's too big
of a pain in the ass.

15:40.965 --> 15:43.266
As evidenced by my experience
in court this morning.

15:43.334 --> 15:44.468
What do you
want from me, Harvey.

15:44.536 --> 15:45.903
I need you
to tell him the truth.

15:45.971 --> 15:47.505
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

15:47.573 --> 15:50.174
- Why didn't you just tell him?
- He's never gonna believe me.

15:50.242 --> 15:51.809
And what makes you think
he'll believe me?

15:54.680 --> 15:57.549
Because he'd want to.

15:59.352 --> 16:02.221
Our whole marriage, Donald's
only cared about one thing.

16:02.289 --> 16:05.057
His sterling reputation.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.025
Never overturned.

16:07.761 --> 16:11.697
I was--when he found out
you and I had...

16:11.764 --> 16:14.532
He changed.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.834
He looked at me
for the first time again.

16:16.902 --> 16:18.336
Like I mattered.

16:20.639 --> 16:21.906
I'm sorry.
I can't tell him.

16:27.812 --> 16:31.215
No, this is a request from
the applicant for--

16:31.282 --> 16:33.984
yes, but I have up
to a year before you--

16:34.051 --> 16:36.420
- hello--no, I can't hold...
- You ready?

16:36.488 --> 16:38.856
I can't go to the club,
I have to do this for Harvey.

16:38.924 --> 16:40.257
Yes, the person before you
said that I had

16:40.325 --> 16:41.892
to file the blue form--
No, no, no, no.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.661
We have a court reserved in
30 minutes, we have to go now.

16:43.729 --> 16:45.396
Yes, I'm trying
to file the oral hearing.

16:45.464 --> 16:47.799
But what you people
keep doing is trans--hello?

16:47.867 --> 16:50.635
Hello?

16:53.340 --> 16:54.707
You work for me, too.

16:54.774 --> 16:56.442
And that means
when Harvey is not here,

16:56.510 --> 16:58.611
you gotta listen
to what I say, Mike.

16:58.679 --> 17:01.047
Louis, this claim needs
to be filed today.

17:01.115 --> 17:03.183
Harvey's orders.

17:03.251 --> 17:05.051
In that case...
Gregory!

17:05.119 --> 17:06.721
I'm on your side, remember?

17:06.789 --> 17:08.388
Watch this.
Yes?

17:08.457 --> 17:10.191
Hi.
Patent interference claim...

17:10.258 --> 17:11.626
Can you have it filed
before we get back?

17:11.694 --> 17:13.426
Cool? Thanks.
Let's go.

17:15.263 --> 17:16.464
What's with the...?

17:35.952 --> 17:38.388
Who's winning?

17:38.455 --> 17:40.990
- You need to warm up?
- No, I'm good.

17:41.058 --> 17:43.760
You serve first.
Come on, show me what you got.

17:43.828 --> 17:45.461
15-love.

17:45.529 --> 17:46.929
All right,
you wanna play like that?

17:46.997 --> 17:47.930
Let's do this thing.
Come on.

17:55.338 --> 17:56.439
Wait, wait.

18:01.277 --> 18:04.046
Hey, Tom.

18:04.114 --> 18:05.414
Game.
Hey, Tom.

18:05.482 --> 18:07.082
We should definitely
have lunch to talk about--

18:07.150 --> 18:08.618
I mean, I have seen
your approach shot, man.

18:08.686 --> 18:09.919
You have really improved.
I'm not kidding.

18:09.987 --> 18:11.254
You know,
maybe you can play now,

18:11.322 --> 18:12.923
me and my associate
were just starting up.

18:12.991 --> 18:15.392
How about you two against me,
I'll just play--

18:15.460 --> 18:16.627
Tom, seriously,
I'll even--

18:16.694 --> 18:18.996
I'll spot you three sets.

18:19.064 --> 18:20.264
All right,
I'll see you later then.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.701
- Isn't that, uh...?
- It's Tom Keller.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.139
Yeah, the premiere
fantasy sports guy, right?

18:27.206 --> 18:29.308
That's him.
Yeah, I play it ever year.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.376
Yeah, you and five million
other fantasy footballers.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.512
I mean, the guy generates
200 million per annum, right?

18:34.580 --> 18:37.648
And he still uses his fraternity
brother as a general counsel.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.883
I mean, someone with that
many assets just makes me sick.

18:39.951 --> 18:41.718
Okay.

18:41.786 --> 18:43.653
- So is it my serve?
- Let's hit the showers.

18:45.856 --> 18:47.590
But, wait...

18:47.657 --> 18:49.392
Sorry, sir, but--

18:49.460 --> 18:52.095
No introductions necessary,
we're on a first name basis.

18:52.163 --> 18:53.530
I brought you a present.

18:53.598 --> 18:56.433
Yours to keep,
after you sign my injunction.

18:56.501 --> 18:58.035
- A pen.
- It's custom.

18:58.103 --> 18:59.870
French.
<i>Le bic.</i>

18:59.938 --> 19:02.340
Oh, my earlier ruling
wasn't clear enough for you?

19:02.407 --> 19:04.742
Crystal, but I didn't
want you to suffer for it.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.911
You see,
if you don't sign my injunction,

19:06.979 --> 19:08.679
there's gonna be a lawsuit.

19:08.747 --> 19:10.648
And when the next judge
sees all the facts,

19:10.716 --> 19:12.383
he's gonna overturn your ruling.

19:12.450 --> 19:13.851
You may be right.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.619
But by then your clients
will have dumped you.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.922
You may be right,
but that sterling reputation

19:17.989 --> 19:20.724
that you value so highly...
Down the tubes.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.960
Which would matter,
except for one thing.

19:23.028 --> 19:26.063
I've decided to leave the bench.

19:26.131 --> 19:28.832
Try my hand at litigation.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.834
And I'm your last case.

19:30.902 --> 19:34.271
Divorce will do that.
Make you wanna change your life.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.840
- You filed for divorce?
- Soon enough.

19:36.908 --> 19:40.076
Perhaps we could discuss

19:40.144 --> 19:42.413
a little quid pro quo
before I do.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.881
I'm listening.

19:44.949 --> 19:47.350
You sign a document that says
you slept with my wife,

19:47.418 --> 19:49.285
I'll give you your injunction.

19:49.353 --> 19:51.054
And why would
you want me to do that?

19:51.121 --> 19:53.856
To prevent her from taking me
for half of everything I own.

19:53.924 --> 19:57.893
So what you're saying
is you'd like to blackmail me.

19:57.961 --> 20:00.395
I'm saying
we could both benefit.

20:00.463 --> 20:02.230
And since you're
the one who screwed me,

20:02.298 --> 20:05.166
I'd say you owe me one.

20:14.311 --> 20:15.344
Harvey Specter.

20:15.412 --> 20:16.713
What are you
hiding from me, Harvey?

20:16.780 --> 20:17.914
Wyatt, do you remember

20:17.982 --> 20:19.616
six months ago
when you got all nervous

20:19.684 --> 20:21.385
and you thought everything
was falling apart?

20:21.452 --> 20:23.320
Yeah, yeah.
But this is a little different.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.455
That's what you said then.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.290
And a year ago,
and 18 months ago.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.359
And we agreed that
when this happens again,

20:28.427 --> 20:30.661
I'll remind you of those times

20:30.729 --> 20:32.397
and I'll hang up.
Okay, Harvey--

20:32.464 --> 20:33.498
Trust me,
it's for your own good.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.333
Harvey,
please don't hang up--

20:42.741 --> 20:44.776
Hey, Tom.
You just missed a great game.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.311
We were, uh...
We were just re--

20:46.379 --> 20:48.213
I was beating him.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.184
You know, ten years ago,

20:53.252 --> 20:55.787
before these dot-com
millionaires,

20:55.855 --> 20:57.222
there were men of substance
in this club.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.224
You know, men who understood
how business gets done.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.627
Well, maybe he's just not
interested in talking business

21:02.695 --> 21:04.728
while he's in a towel.
Like, he's not interested

21:04.796 --> 21:06.597
because he doesn't
think I'm cool.

21:06.665 --> 21:07.965
And he's a pothead who thinks

21:08.033 --> 21:10.201
that anybody who
doesn't smoke is a nerd.

21:10.268 --> 21:12.570
I mean...

21:12.637 --> 21:14.238
so I treat my body
like a temple?

21:14.305 --> 21:17.274
Does that make me uncool?
I don't think so.

21:17.341 --> 21:20.076
No.

21:20.144 --> 21:22.011
But on the other hand...

21:22.079 --> 21:24.581
You kinda seem his type.

21:24.648 --> 21:26.349
- Why do you say that?
- Because you're young.

21:26.417 --> 21:29.853
And you think
of yourself as...hip.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.055
Whatever, I guess.
You know, I'm sure you

21:32.123 --> 21:36.159
enjoyed
the occasional bong hit.

21:36.227 --> 21:38.962
No.
No, I don't smoke.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.167
I mean, that's just
a little strange.

21:43.234 --> 21:44.568
Why is it strange?

21:44.636 --> 21:47.004
I mean, because
the drug test that you took--

21:47.072 --> 21:49.807
well, that I made you take--
would indicate otherwise.

21:59.317 --> 22:00.717
You're not gonna
dispute it now, are you?

22:02.386 --> 22:04.587
Relax, Mike.

22:04.655 --> 22:05.688
Relax.

22:05.756 --> 22:07.356
I'm not offended.

22:07.424 --> 22:08.724
I'm not even surprised.

22:08.791 --> 22:09.892
And in fact,
in this instance,

22:09.959 --> 22:11.594
we can use this
to our advantage.

22:11.661 --> 22:13.062
What are you
talking about, Louis?

22:13.129 --> 22:14.597
I'm just saying,
you know, back in the day,

22:14.665 --> 22:16.399
to woo a client you
would take him to dinner,

22:16.467 --> 22:17.700
you would buy him a drink.

22:17.768 --> 22:19.101
But that's
not gonna work with Tom.

22:19.169 --> 22:21.705
Not in a million years.
Not with me, anyway.

22:21.772 --> 22:23.606
But with
someone of his generation

22:23.674 --> 22:24.941
who shares
the same proclivities?

22:25.009 --> 22:27.344
You saying you want me
to smoke pot with him?

22:27.412 --> 22:29.580
I'm saying you can
help me land him as a client.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.219
That's the only
reason I'm here, isn't it?

22:34.286 --> 22:35.554
No, Mike.
Stop.

22:35.621 --> 22:37.122
Just stop, okay?

22:37.190 --> 22:39.692
I assure you, no one was
more disappointed than me

22:39.760 --> 22:42.128
when I found out the results
of your drug test, okay?

22:42.196 --> 22:44.230
Then I had to say to myself,
"Louis, do what you do,

22:44.298 --> 22:47.901
make lemonade."

22:47.969 --> 22:51.071
And if I don't?

22:51.139 --> 22:54.340
You're a smart kid.

22:54.408 --> 22:56.009
And I really
wanna see you succeed.

23:04.786 --> 23:05.819
Ball's in your court.

23:09.190 --> 23:10.991
Hey, Tom, I was
just gonna tell you,

23:11.059 --> 23:12.793
I wanted to--
okay.

23:18.199 --> 23:19.666
Dude creeps me out, man.

23:19.734 --> 23:21.635
And he never
wears a towel, ever.

23:21.702 --> 23:23.336
Yeah, tell me about it.

23:27.174 --> 23:29.242
Hey, I know you must
hear this all the time,

23:29.310 --> 23:31.845
but totally addicted
to your website, man.

23:31.912 --> 23:35.515
All right, who placed sixth
in passing yards last year?

23:35.583 --> 23:37.384
Carson Palmer.

23:37.452 --> 23:39.052
3,970.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.720
How many sacks
did James Hall have?

23:40.788 --> 23:42.523
11?

23:42.590 --> 23:44.625
Uh-uh.
Ten and a half.

23:44.693 --> 23:46.927
- Yeah, I know, I rounded up.
- Well, your league doesn't

23:46.995 --> 23:48.396
or I would've
come in better than 20th.

23:51.366 --> 23:53.568
Your Ross's Raiders,
right?

23:53.636 --> 23:55.270
Yeah, Mike Ross.

23:55.337 --> 23:57.339
- Tom Keller.
- Good to meet you.

23:57.406 --> 23:59.274
Congratulations, man, you
got a nice little team there.

23:59.341 --> 24:00.709
Yeah.

24:00.776 --> 24:02.077
No, if Roethlisberger
hadn't let you down,

24:02.144 --> 24:03.545
you'd have been top ten
for sure, I'm telling you.

24:03.612 --> 24:04.846
Yeah, well,
that's what happens

24:04.914 --> 24:07.081
when you get high
before the draft, right?

24:07.149 --> 24:10.017
You get high?

24:18.760 --> 24:22.095
Mm.

24:29.505 --> 24:32.341
Oh.

24:45.520 --> 24:48.355
How's it going with Harvey?

24:49.724 --> 24:50.991
Me?

24:51.059 --> 24:54.461
Uh...It's...
You know, it's good.

24:54.528 --> 24:56.129
I'm learning.

24:57.598 --> 24:59.032
A lot of learning.
Bye.

25:34.405 --> 25:38.007
What's black and white
and gonna cost you dearly?

25:38.075 --> 25:39.408
Whoa.

25:39.476 --> 25:42.378
Took me all morning
to file this, golden boy.

25:42.446 --> 25:44.413
You owe me
and I won't forget it.

25:44.481 --> 25:46.583
Oh, God!
Thank you.

25:46.650 --> 25:48.919
You smell papery.

25:52.657 --> 25:54.391
Wyatt,
it doesn't happen immediately.

25:54.459 --> 25:56.160
The paperwork's coming.

25:56.228 --> 25:58.229
Don't worry about it, okay?

25:58.296 --> 26:01.232
Boom.
There you go, look at that.

26:01.300 --> 26:03.534
Wyatt, let me
call you back, okay?

26:03.602 --> 26:05.636
Five minutes.
Bye.

26:05.704 --> 26:08.306
- What's this?
- What is this?

26:08.373 --> 26:10.174
That's confirmation
of the interference claim

26:10.242 --> 26:12.443
which I proofed.
Up top.

26:12.511 --> 26:14.345
What, you think
you're working in a fraternity?

26:14.412 --> 26:15.813
You don't barge in here
when I'm on the phone.

26:15.881 --> 26:19.116
And why you so flushed?

26:19.184 --> 26:21.752
- Why am I so what?
- Your face is red.

26:21.820 --> 26:23.187
It looks like
you've been in the sun.

26:23.255 --> 26:25.056
Um...Yeah, I--

26:25.123 --> 26:29.394
I--this morning, Louis
took me to the tennis club.

26:29.462 --> 26:31.763
He didn't give you
the speech about the, um,

26:31.831 --> 26:34.132
the ponies, did he?
Oh, my God.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.667
How he likes
to cut one from the herd.

26:35.735 --> 26:37.236
The ponies.

26:37.303 --> 26:38.504
Was he wearing the headband?

26:38.571 --> 26:40.739
You know about the headband?
With the...

26:40.807 --> 26:42.742
Oh, my God, are you
kidding me with that guy?

26:42.809 --> 26:44.810
Hey, if you guys were
playing tennis all morning,

26:44.878 --> 26:46.879
how'd you have time
to file this?

26:50.017 --> 26:51.818
Uh...

26:51.886 --> 26:53.453
He--it was this morning--

26:53.520 --> 26:55.355
actually,
I was on the phone with them,

26:55.422 --> 26:58.124
and Louis helped me--
Look at me.

26:58.192 --> 27:00.194
And he did this
snapping thing, and Gregory--

27:00.261 --> 27:03.030
Look at me.

27:08.068 --> 27:10.936
You're high.

27:12.439 --> 27:14.274
Get out.

27:16.077 --> 27:17.577
Harvey, you don't understand.
Louis--

27:17.645 --> 27:20.513
Out.

27:31.927 --> 27:33.727
Donna?

27:33.795 --> 27:36.563
Can you get
Wyatt back on the line?

27:52.980 --> 27:54.914
What are you doing in here?

27:54.982 --> 27:57.450
It's the ladies room.

27:57.518 --> 28:00.887
I'm sorry.

28:00.955 --> 28:03.990
Look, can you do me a favor?
Can we--

28:04.057 --> 28:06.292
can we just keep this
our little secret?

28:06.360 --> 28:09.028
Why are your eyes so red?

28:11.899 --> 28:15.134
I need some air.

28:15.202 --> 28:17.469
You took Mike Ross on
a field trip today?

28:17.537 --> 28:19.404
- Yep.
- Aside from subjecting him

28:19.472 --> 28:21.006
to you in a towel,
what happened?

28:21.074 --> 28:22.974
Well, I beat him in
straight sets,

28:23.042 --> 28:24.576
if that's what you're get--
Don't play dumb, Louis.

28:24.644 --> 28:26.111
Tell me what you did to him.
What're you, jealous?

28:26.179 --> 28:28.179
Harvey, come on, the kid
is starving for a mentor,

28:28.247 --> 28:29.547
someone to give him
some advice.

28:29.615 --> 28:31.115
So maybe if you
just took the time--

28:31.183 --> 28:33.317
I'm telling you right now,
you try to move in on him--

28:33.385 --> 28:34.652
Harvey,
where is this coming from?

28:34.720 --> 28:36.387
Harvey,
I've got the outside counsel

28:36.455 --> 28:39.191
for Velocity on the line.
Put them through.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.668
What happened after
you smoked with that guy?

28:47.735 --> 28:49.670
- Here.
- I just got paranoid.

28:49.738 --> 28:51.872
I felt bad for lying to him,

28:51.940 --> 28:55.176
I told him that Louis
put me up to it

28:55.243 --> 28:56.110
and that he couldn't
trust him.

28:56.178 --> 28:57.745
So what did he say?

28:57.813 --> 29:00.281
He said that Louis
gave him the creeps anyway.

29:00.349 --> 29:01.649
You know,
he's never gonna hire him.

29:01.717 --> 29:02.951
Okay,
you have to tell Harvey.

29:04.386 --> 29:06.153
I tried,
he wasn't listening.

29:06.221 --> 29:07.989
So then go home
and tell him tomorrow.

29:08.057 --> 29:10.158
Oh, God, you should've
seen his face.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.994
- We had a deal.
- What deal?

29:16.998 --> 29:18.932
- Thanks for hearing me out.
- No, what're you talking about?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.267
What deal?
It's nothing.

29:20.334 --> 29:23.336
I just promised that
I wouldn't...

29:23.404 --> 29:26.039
Do anything stupid
and let him down, and I did.

29:26.107 --> 29:27.375
Wait, you let him down?

29:27.442 --> 29:29.644
No, the way I see it,
he let you down.

29:29.711 --> 29:31.178
What?

29:31.246 --> 29:32.847
He's gotta know
what Louis is capable of,

29:32.914 --> 29:34.381
so if he didn't
listen to what happened

29:34.449 --> 29:35.949
it's 'cause
he didn't want to.

29:36.017 --> 29:37.551
Mike, you need to tell him.

29:37.619 --> 29:39.386
I don't know how often
you come across Harvey,

29:39.454 --> 29:41.054
but he's not exactly
the listening type.

29:41.122 --> 29:42.923
Right.

29:42.991 --> 29:45.259
But he's also the first person
that would tell you

29:45.327 --> 29:48.094
never to take no for an answer
from anyone.

29:56.437 --> 29:58.839
Harvey, how you doing
this fine day?

29:58.907 --> 30:01.876
I'm ready to hear
your settlement offer, George.

30:01.943 --> 30:03.645
Cutting to the chase,
I like that.

30:03.712 --> 30:07.082
What's the number?

30:07.149 --> 30:09.685
Ten million.

30:09.753 --> 30:12.422
That's half what we spent
developing the prototype.

30:12.490 --> 30:13.957
And ten million
more than you'll get,

30:14.025 --> 30:16.492
the way the wind's blowing.
Yeah, well, winds can change.

30:16.560 --> 30:17.894
And you and I both know
the injunction

30:17.962 --> 30:19.295
will get overturned
on appeal.

30:19.363 --> 30:20.697
I don't know
anything of the kind.

30:20.765 --> 30:22.666
Then why are you calling
with an offer at all?

30:27.438 --> 30:29.472
15, that's
as high as I'll go.

30:29.540 --> 30:32.075
- Okay, I'm hanging up now.
- 20 million, that's it.

30:32.143 --> 30:34.211
The offer's good for 24 hours.

30:34.278 --> 30:35.779
And I'm sure
I don't have to remind you

30:35.847 --> 30:38.615
that you're legally required
to present this to your client.

30:47.651 --> 30:49.114
Is he free?

30:49.115 --> 30:50.816
Not for you.

30:50.884 --> 30:52.317
How much did he tell you?

30:52.385 --> 30:56.187
He didn't have to tell me,
I read it on his face.

30:56.255 --> 30:57.855
- You heard him.
- Maybe he did the same to me.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.195
Get in there.

31:04.931 --> 31:07.800
And be careful.

31:11.271 --> 31:13.406
Harvey.

31:13.474 --> 31:15.809
We talked about this, right?
Barging into my office.

31:15.877 --> 31:17.277
I'm not leaving
until you hear me out.

31:17.345 --> 31:19.113
- Wanna bet?
- You owe it to me.

31:19.180 --> 31:21.182
- Oh, I owe it to you?
- Yeah.

31:21.249 --> 31:22.683
Look, this is
not my fault, all right?

31:22.751 --> 31:24.451
- Louis made me do it.
- Louis did, right.

31:24.519 --> 31:26.387
He put a gun to your head
and made you smoke pot.

31:26.455 --> 31:28.589
Yeah, he did.
He pulled out the drug test--

31:28.657 --> 31:30.090
which I failed, by the way.

31:30.158 --> 31:31.725
And then he told me
that if I didn't smoke pot

31:31.793 --> 31:34.561
to help him land this
new client, that he'd fire me.

31:37.164 --> 31:38.397
Come on.

31:38.465 --> 31:39.665
It's not so different
than asking someone

31:39.733 --> 31:41.900
out for drinks, is it?
You and I had a deal.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.569
I'm sorry.

31:43.637 --> 31:45.437
And if next time
Louis asks you to do something

31:45.505 --> 31:47.840
that I told you not to do,
what then?

31:47.907 --> 31:50.008
I told you that
I did not have a choice.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.109
Oh, because
he had a gun to your head.

31:51.177 --> 31:52.477
- Yes!
- What are your choices

31:52.545 --> 31:53.912
if someone
puts a gun to your head?

31:53.980 --> 31:55.447
What are you talking about?
You do what they say

31:55.515 --> 31:56.848
or they shoot you.
Wrong.

31:56.916 --> 31:59.051
You take the gun,
or you pull out a bigger one,

31:59.119 --> 32:00.552
or you call their bluff.

32:00.620 --> 32:03.254
Or you do any one of
146 other things.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.455
If you can't
think for yourself,

32:04.523 --> 32:05.923
maybe you
aren't cut out for this.

32:05.991 --> 32:08.192
No, I can and I am.
Look, I did what I had to do.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.027
I made the best out
of a bad situation.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.496
Which is what I am good at.

32:11.563 --> 32:13.231
Which is what you hired me
to do in the first place.

32:13.298 --> 32:15.432
Yeah, I hired you
and I expect your loyalty.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.634
So if Louis asks you to do
something like that,

32:17.702 --> 32:19.536
you come to me first.
Oh, right.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.805
Like when I came to you
and you told me

32:21.872 --> 32:23.373
that I couldn't sit
at the adult table, right.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.442
I remember that.
Or-or when you told me

32:25.509 --> 32:27.144
to go file the patent
by myself, like that?

32:27.212 --> 32:29.046
- Excuse me?
- You know what?

32:29.114 --> 32:31.882
Maybe it's time
you showed me some loyalty.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.487
Do you know how long it was

32:35.554 --> 32:38.690
before I got
to sit at the adult table?

32:38.758 --> 32:40.159
It was when
I brought in my first client.

32:40.226 --> 32:42.428
Which I don't recall
you having done.

32:42.496 --> 32:44.997
And when you screwed up
that patent

32:45.065 --> 32:46.932
and Wyatt
went ape shit on me,

32:47.000 --> 32:48.967
I didn't put that on you,
I took it on myself.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.603
Because that's my job.

32:50.670 --> 32:53.272
And it's your job to do
what I say when I say it.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.541
So if you're
talking about loyalty,

32:55.609 --> 32:58.444
you better goddamn earn it.

33:01.047 --> 33:04.617
You're right.

33:04.685 --> 33:07.420
I said I'm sorry and
I meant it.

33:09.423 --> 33:10.990
Harvey...

33:11.058 --> 33:14.228
I want you to tr--
I need you to trust me, okay?

33:14.296 --> 33:15.930
And I will
work as long as I can,

33:15.998 --> 33:18.333
as hard as it takes
to make that happen.

33:18.401 --> 33:19.634
I mean,

33:19.702 --> 33:20.802
you don't even
have to pay me, all right?

33:20.870 --> 33:23.205
I'll work for free.

33:23.272 --> 33:25.573
For free.

33:25.641 --> 33:27.642
What, I meant...not forever.

33:27.710 --> 33:29.177
Just as, like,
a probationary thing.

33:29.244 --> 33:30.878
Donna,
tell Wyatt I'm on my way over.

33:30.946 --> 33:32.213
Do you never
have to press a button?

33:32.281 --> 33:33.447
Got it.
And Jessica wants to see

33:33.515 --> 33:34.448
Mike in her office right now.

33:37.485 --> 33:39.853
Louis told me
what you did at the club.

33:41.255 --> 33:43.457
I bet he didn't
tell you the whole story.

33:43.524 --> 33:45.993
He told me enough
to impress me.

33:50.099 --> 33:52.500
New business is hard.

33:52.568 --> 33:54.169
People will
promise you the world

33:54.236 --> 33:56.138
but until they
sign that engagement letter,

33:56.205 --> 33:59.608
it means nothing.

33:59.676 --> 34:02.378
Now I don't know
what you told Tom Keller,

34:02.446 --> 34:05.482
but bring a client in
at your age...

34:05.550 --> 34:06.850
That reminds me of Harvey.

34:09.353 --> 34:11.120
Jessica,
before we get started,

34:11.188 --> 34:12.188
there's
something in the retainer

34:12.255 --> 34:13.656
that Tom pointed out.

34:13.723 --> 34:14.889
It's not a big deal, really.

34:14.958 --> 34:16.257
- We were just--
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

34:16.326 --> 34:17.960
Like I said,
we're here to make you happy.

34:18.027 --> 34:20.896
Right?

34:25.268 --> 34:27.235
I thought you
wanted nothing to do with him?

34:27.304 --> 34:29.438
I didn't.
But then I thought about it.

34:29.505 --> 34:31.107
And he might not
be a very good person,

34:31.175 --> 34:32.708
but a little deviousness

34:32.775 --> 34:34.643
is the sort of thing
you look for in a good lawyer.

34:34.712 --> 34:36.713
I mean, the other guy
I was with, he was too nice.

34:36.781 --> 34:39.416
We were buddies,
we went to school together.

34:39.484 --> 34:41.083
It's time I grew up,
got a real shark.

34:41.152 --> 34:43.286
Well, I had no intention

34:43.355 --> 34:45.089
of being that way
to get your business.

34:45.157 --> 34:48.391
That's exactly why I insisted
that you be my point man.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.761
I want someone
being devious for me,

34:50.829 --> 34:51.728
not to me.

34:54.333 --> 34:55.967
- What?
- It's just...

34:56.034 --> 34:58.269
Louis would've never
told Jessica that I existed,

34:58.337 --> 35:00.505
let alone that I helped him
if you hadn't done that.

35:00.572 --> 35:03.407
Hey, the way I see it,
the three of us stick together,

35:03.475 --> 35:04.608
we'll make a pretty good team.

35:08.146 --> 35:09.814
You know,
I got a better idea.

35:09.881 --> 35:11.282
$20 million?

35:11.350 --> 35:13.784
They claim
it's their final offer.

35:13.852 --> 35:15.453
That's what it cost to
make the prototype.

35:15.521 --> 35:19.491
Not to mention my entire savings
and two years of my life.

35:19.558 --> 35:21.425
Wyatt...

35:21.493 --> 35:23.928
They know we're stalled
on our injunction.

35:23.996 --> 35:27.097
Which means, to them,
they're giving you a fair price

35:27.165 --> 35:29.767
as an insurance policy
against the risk of possibly

35:29.835 --> 35:31.936
losing the interference claim.

35:32.004 --> 35:34.038
I don't care
what it is to them.

35:34.106 --> 35:37.341
It's not fair.

35:37.409 --> 35:40.211
Fair or not,
it's their final offer.

35:44.416 --> 35:47.818
You think I should take it?

35:47.886 --> 35:50.655
I think you should tell them
to shove it up their ass.

35:52.392 --> 35:54.844
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm terribly sorry,

35:54.845 --> 35:56.880
but we have a problem.

35:56.947 --> 35:58.314
What problem?

35:58.382 --> 36:00.149
We came down here
because you led us to believe

36:00.217 --> 36:01.618
that your client
was ready to accept

36:01.685 --> 36:03.853
our settlement agreement.
And I thought he would.

36:03.921 --> 36:05.788
Look, I took him the offer.

36:05.856 --> 36:09.024
I presented it to him,
and recommended that he take it.

36:09.092 --> 36:10.292
In fact,
I urged him to take it.

36:10.359 --> 36:12.127
You know what he told me to do?

36:12.195 --> 36:14.062
He told me to tell you to
shove it up your ass.

36:18.100 --> 36:20.468
Now I know you didn't have
me come all the way down here

36:20.536 --> 36:21.837
just to tell me that.

36:21.904 --> 36:24.507
You're right.
That's not all Wyatt said.

36:24.574 --> 36:26.309
He said rather than
spending years

36:26.376 --> 36:29.079
fighting this out in court,
in 48 hours

36:29.147 --> 36:32.249
he's gonna put this online.

36:34.220 --> 36:36.821
That's a little rough,
but you get the idea.

36:36.889 --> 36:39.191
What are you showing us?
Is this a website?

36:39.259 --> 36:41.860
Available at
the Suntech domain name.

36:41.928 --> 36:44.129
All the design plans and
calculations have been uploaded.

36:44.197 --> 36:45.998
- Is this online now?
- Can be.

36:46.066 --> 36:48.500
Which means the whole world
will have access to my designs.

36:48.568 --> 36:50.602
They'll be ten knock-offs
of that phone

36:50.669 --> 36:52.638
before you can catch
a cab back to your headquarters.

36:52.705 --> 36:55.607
- We could file an injunction.
- Not before tomorrow.

36:55.675 --> 36:58.243
And once
that technology is out there,

36:58.311 --> 36:59.711
good luck putting
that genie back in the bottle.

36:59.779 --> 37:01.346
Well, then we'll sue.

37:01.414 --> 37:03.015
But my client won't
have any money.

37:03.083 --> 37:05.751
What he will have is credit
for the initial design.

37:05.819 --> 37:08.654
Which, after he incorporates
under a different name,

37:08.722 --> 37:10.589
will be worth
a hell of a lot more money

37:10.657 --> 37:12.358
than the $20 million that
you're offering.

37:16.530 --> 37:19.298
And you're saying that
this was all your client's idea.

37:22.769 --> 37:23.935
Yes.

37:24.003 --> 37:27.038
That's what I'm saying.

37:40.886 --> 37:41.986
Thought you weren't coming.

37:42.054 --> 37:44.622
I had to settle a case first.

37:44.690 --> 37:47.358
You have the paperwork
we talked about?

37:57.104 --> 37:59.038
What is this?

37:59.106 --> 38:01.173
It's a copy of
the judicial conduct codes.

38:01.241 --> 38:03.408
A friend of mine works at
the Attorney General's office

38:03.476 --> 38:05.176
gave it to me.
We had a nice chat about you.

38:05.244 --> 38:08.713
I told him if you were willing
to blackmail someone once,

38:08.780 --> 38:10.180
chances are
you'd done it before.

38:10.248 --> 38:12.249
He's very anxious to meet you.

38:12.317 --> 38:14.151
You think you can
get away with screwing my wife

38:14.219 --> 38:15.952
and then have me investigated?

38:16.020 --> 38:17.621
You actually have it
the wrong way around.

38:17.688 --> 38:19.823
The only thing I've
done so far

38:19.891 --> 38:21.458
is have you investigated.

38:21.526 --> 38:23.427
What?

38:23.494 --> 38:25.729
I never
actually slept with Lauren.

38:25.797 --> 38:27.598
But I knew
you'd never believe me

38:27.666 --> 38:29.200
so I kept my mouth shut.

38:29.268 --> 38:30.802
But now that
she's getting a divorce,

38:30.870 --> 38:32.504
my policy no longer applies.

38:32.572 --> 38:35.908
And of course, she's free to
date whoever she pleases.

38:37.477 --> 38:39.812
And she pleases me.

38:39.880 --> 38:42.714
Enjoy your evening, Donald.

39:05.272 --> 39:07.941
I've always
heard about this place.

39:08.009 --> 39:10.410
Which room is Hoffa buried in?

39:10.477 --> 39:12.445
Not sure, but...

39:12.513 --> 39:16.182
The Arc of the Covenant's
just down the hall on the left.

39:16.249 --> 39:17.450
When you're
finished down here,

39:17.518 --> 39:18.885
I'd like you to come upstairs

39:18.952 --> 39:22.289
and start putting together
a settlement memorandum.

39:22.356 --> 39:24.791
- They went for it?
- Thanks to your idea.

39:24.859 --> 39:27.193
Well, I mean,
it wasn't really my idea--

39:27.261 --> 39:28.494
They're settling for
400 million.

39:28.562 --> 39:29.963
Okay, yeah, that was my idea.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.100
So does this mean
I get to keep my job?

39:34.168 --> 39:35.468
I wanna
talk to you about that.

39:35.536 --> 39:37.137
- Before you do, Harvey--
- Do we have to have

39:37.204 --> 39:38.538
a conversation about
how you keep interrupting me?

39:38.606 --> 39:40.574
Um...

39:40.641 --> 39:43.677
Look, sometimes when
someone pulls a gun on you,

39:43.744 --> 39:47.514
instead of bullets
it's filled with blanks.

39:47.582 --> 39:48.949
What's this?

39:49.016 --> 39:50.884
It's a copy of
your drug test results.

39:50.952 --> 39:53.019
But this says I passed.

39:53.087 --> 39:55.756
You did.

39:55.824 --> 39:57.925
Louis showed me a fake?

39:57.993 --> 39:59.226
I'm gonna go
have a talk with him.

40:01.562 --> 40:05.032
You know what,
why don't you let me do it?

40:05.099 --> 40:06.533
You think you're ready
for the adult table?

40:06.601 --> 40:09.503
What, didn't you hear?
I just landed my first client.

40:09.570 --> 40:11.605
Why do you think
I'm showing you this now

40:11.673 --> 40:12.773
and not going straight
to Louis?

40:16.811 --> 40:19.179
- Go easy on him.
- Nope.

40:19.247 --> 40:21.981
Good boy.

40:24.218 --> 40:25.785
You lied.

40:25.852 --> 40:27.420
That other drug test
you showed me was a fake.

40:27.487 --> 40:28.754
How'd you figure that out?

40:28.821 --> 40:30.889
Someone once told me
I have an eye for detail

40:30.957 --> 40:32.524
when it comes
to important paperwork.

40:32.592 --> 40:34.359
Well, maybe you're not
as good as you think you are,

40:34.426 --> 40:35.894
or you
would've caught it sooner.

40:35.961 --> 40:38.330
Okay, so this was
all some sort of test?

40:38.397 --> 40:40.698
You blackmail me,
you jeopardize my job?

40:40.766 --> 40:42.400
Mike, stop.
Stop.

40:42.467 --> 40:44.368
We all came out ahead,
didn't we?

40:44.436 --> 40:46.169
That new client's
gonna bring us millions.

40:46.237 --> 40:47.872
Jessica knows your name now.

40:47.939 --> 40:49.440
It's a win-win.

40:52.176 --> 40:54.043
You're right.

40:54.111 --> 40:56.178
She does know my name.

40:56.246 --> 40:58.280
Which is why she'll listen
when I tell her

40:58.348 --> 41:00.015
exactly what happened.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.985
Okay,
but before you do that

41:04.053 --> 41:06.688
it is...that time again,
isn't it?

41:06.756 --> 41:08.156
What time?

41:08.224 --> 41:10.825
Pee in a cup time.

41:10.893 --> 41:12.994
Oh.

41:13.062 --> 41:14.562
And now you know I'd fail.

41:14.629 --> 41:15.796
Of course,
you can run to mommy,

41:15.864 --> 41:17.398
tell her your story,
and take your chances.

41:17.466 --> 41:19.734
Or you can
take the test and trust

41:19.802 --> 41:22.537
that I'll keep it to myself
as my way of thanking you.

41:35.253 --> 41:37.721
Ah, you know,
I actually did some reading

41:37.789 --> 41:40.623
of the Pearson-Harmon
drug policy as well.

41:40.691 --> 41:43.226
It turns out that you
have to wait three months

41:43.293 --> 41:45.027
before you can
request another drug test.

41:45.095 --> 41:46.996
See, it's a little detail that
you might've missed.

41:47.064 --> 41:49.898
So, drink up.

41:51.234 --> 41:53.568
Oh, and I spoke to Tom Keller.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.370
He says that he feels
he'd be best served

41:55.437 --> 41:57.672
with a combination of
me and Harvey.

41:57.740 --> 42:00.475
I think you'll get
that call in the morning.
