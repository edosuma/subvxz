WEBVTT

00:04.832 --> 00:06.634
HOME TO THOUSANDS OF
RESTAURANTS.

00:06.667 --> 00:09.036
<i>THE</i> MOST COMPETITIVE CITY
IN THE WORLD.

00:09.069 --> 00:10.571
BUT THERE'S ONE RESTAURANT
THAT NEEDS MY HELP

00:10.604 --> 00:11.238
MORE THAN ANY OTHER,

00:11.272 --> 00:13.507
AND IT'S RIGHT DOWN THERE.

00:13.541 --> 00:15.976
TONIGHT ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,</i>

00:16.010 --> 00:19.480
NEW YORK CITY MAY BE
THE MECCA OF FINE DINING,

00:19.513 --> 00:21.448
BUT IN THE HEART OF MANHATTAN

00:21.482 --> 00:23.417
IS A RESTAURANT
IN SUCH BAD SHAPE,

00:23.450 --> 00:26.520
IT MAY PROVE TO BE
GORDON'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE YET.

00:26.554 --> 00:27.821
OH, MY GOD!

00:27.855 --> 00:29.890
DILLONS, AN INDIAN EATERY,

00:29.924 --> 00:30.000
IS NOT ON THE VERGE
OF DISASTER...

00:30.000 --> 00:31.692
IS NOT ON THE VERGE
OF DISASTER...

00:31.725 --> 00:33.027
WHAT DO WE NEED,
A DEATH IN THE RESTAURANT

00:33.060 --> 00:34.461
BEFORE SOME
GETS A GRIP?

00:34.495 --> 00:35.729
IT'S ALREADY THERE.

00:35.763 --> 00:37.398
IT'S ROTTEN, MY MAN!

00:37.431 --> 00:38.799
THE MENU IS CONFUSING.

00:38.832 --> 00:40.334
BRITISH, ITALIAN--

00:40.367 --> 00:41.936
THE ONLY THING THAT'S NOT
ON HERE IS CHINESE.

00:41.969 --> 00:42.736
THE FOOD IS AWFUL.

00:42.770 --> 00:44.405
GREEN BURGERS KILL PEOPLE!

00:44.438 --> 00:46.607
THERE IS A LANGUAGE BARRIER.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.776
TELL HIM IN YOUR LANGUAGE
HE'LL KILL SOMEBODY!

00:48.809 --> 00:50.611
AND AS FAR
AS THE CLEANLINESS GOES...

00:50.644 --> 00:51.812
HOLY!

00:51.845 --> 00:53.180
OH, MY GOD!

00:53.214 --> 00:54.748
IT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT.

00:54.782 --> 00:56.584
AND WHAT MAKES MATTERS WORSE,

00:56.617 --> 00:59.353
THE NUMEROUS MANAGERS
DON'T SEEM TO CARE.

00:59.386 --> 01:00.000
I HAVE NOTHING TO BE GUILTY OF.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.121
I HAVE NOTHING TO BE GUILTY OF.

01:01.155 --> 01:02.122
YOU WHAT?

01:02.156 --> 01:03.557
NO ONE IS GETTING SERVED

01:03.591 --> 01:05.492
ON THIS  RESTAURANT
TONIGHT.

01:05.526 --> 01:07.628
GET READY TO WITNESS
ONE CRAZY WEEK

01:07.661 --> 01:09.496
IN THE LIFE OF GORDON RAMSAY.

01:09.530 --> 01:12.566
THIS IS THE LUCKIEST DAY
OF THEIR  LIFE, OKAY?

01:12.600 --> 01:14.702
AS HE ATTEMPTS TO TURN AROUND

01:14.735 --> 01:15.936
A MANHATTAN MESS.

01:15.970 --> 01:17.204
CAN YOU GO AND TELL THEM

01:17.238 --> 01:18.839
THAT THE KITCHEN IS CLOSED.

01:18.872 --> 01:22.142
TONIGHT ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.</i>

01:46.233 --> 01:47.568
YES, LISA.
HOW ARE YOU?

01:47.601 --> 01:49.336
WE'RE DILLONS.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.138
THIS IS AN AMERICAN-IRISH
RESTAURANT.

01:51.171 --> 01:54.875
WE'VE AN INDIAN-NESS
CONNECTED TO IT.

01:59.880 --> 02:00.000
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE

02:00.000 --> 02:01.315
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE

02:01.348 --> 02:03.117
THAT DILLONS HAS LASTED
THIS LONG.

02:03.150 --> 02:05.986
OKAY, AND YOU HAD EIGHT PEOPLE
LEAVE ON YOU, YES?

02:06.020 --> 02:08.489
WE KIND OF LURCH BETWEEN
CATASTROPHE AND DISASTER.

02:11.358 --> 02:12.860
WE STARTED THIS RESTAURANT

02:15.029 --> 02:17.598
BUT THE RESTAURANT
IS NOT DOING THAT WELL.

02:17.631 --> 02:19.600
DILLONS, GOOD EVENING,
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

02:19.633 --> 02:21.935
WE HIRED MARTIN TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS BUSINESS.

02:21.969 --> 02:22.936
LA DA DA DA.

02:22.970 --> 02:24.004
I HAVE AN OBJECTIVE.

02:24.038 --> 02:25.472
THE IDEA WAS TO CAPTURE

02:25.506 --> 02:26.774
THE BEST OF ALL WORLDS.

02:26.807 --> 02:28.175
WHAT ARE WE CHOOSING FROM?

02:28.208 --> 02:29.610
WE HAVE BEEF BHUNA.

02:29.643 --> 02:30.000
WHICH MENU?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.178
WHICH MENU?

02:31.211 --> 02:32.379
LAMB CHOPS, SHEPARD'S PIE--

02:32.413 --> 02:33.681
THAT'S THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE.

02:33.714 --> 02:34.748
HAMBURGERS.

02:38.052 --> 02:39.687
I THINK PEOPLE
ARE A BIT CONFUSED

02:39.720 --> 02:42.656
AS TO, LIKE, WHAT KIND
OF RESTAURANT THIS IS.

02:42.690 --> 02:46.260
I DON'T KNOW WHAT EACH MANAGER
DOES SPECIFICALLY.

02:47.895 --> 02:49.096
I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER.

02:49.129 --> 02:50.331
I'M THE OPERATIONS MANAGER.

02:50.364 --> 02:51.732
AND I'M THE FLOOR MANAGER
HERE.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.468
NOBODY REALLY KNEW KHAN
WAS A MANAGER.

02:54.501 --> 02:56.403
HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING HERE.

02:56.437 --> 02:57.871
I DON'T LIKE TO WORK HERE

02:57.905 --> 02:59.340
BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S
SO MESSED UP.

03:02.309 --> 03:03.711
I THINK IN AN IDEAL WORLD,

03:03.744 --> 03:05.612
MARTIN WOULD BE
AN ONGOING CHARACTER

03:05.646 --> 03:06.880
IN A REALITY TV SERIES.

03:06.914 --> 03:08.382
MARTIN, MARTIN.

03:08.415 --> 03:09.717
THANK YOU.

03:09.750 --> 03:10.918
MY RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE

03:10.951 --> 03:12.586
AN AWFUL LOT OF THINGS.

03:12.619 --> 03:16.790
I MAKE SURE
THAT EVERYTHING RUNS.

03:16.824 --> 03:19.193
IF SOMETHING'S BROKEN,
I FIX IT.

03:19.226 --> 03:20.627
I MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S
TOILET PAPER

03:20.661 --> 03:22.429
TO WIPE YOUR BUTT WITH.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.998
FREQUENTLY I WILL HAVE
TO COOK SOMETHING

03:25.032 --> 03:26.667
BECAUSE THE COOKS WHO MAKE
THE INDIAN FOOD--

03:28.068 --> 03:29.803
DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE
AMERICAN FOOD.

03:31.338 --> 03:33.273
IF WE GET CUSTOMERS IN HERE,

03:33.307 --> 03:35.275
I WILL WALK UP TO TABLES,
SERVE THEM THEIR FOOD,

03:35.309 --> 03:36.510
AND THEY'LL BE SWATTING FLIES
AWAY.

03:37.378 --> 03:38.946
IT IS DISGUSTING.

03:42.149 --> 03:44.651
THE KITCHEN'S NOT CLEAN.

03:44.685 --> 03:45.953
THAT PROBLEM HAS BEEN
ERADICATED NOW.

03:45.986 --> 03:47.421
I THINK IT HAS.

03:47.454 --> 03:51.658
OH, THERE'S A FLY.

03:51.692 --> 03:53.327
FOR LAST SIX MONTHS,

03:53.360 --> 03:55.329
WE ARE LOSING, LIKE,
$20,000 TO $30,000 A MONTH.

03:55.362 --> 03:57.431
I CANNOT CONTINUE
LOSING MONEY LIKE THIS.

03:57.464 --> 04:00.000
I DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE
WITH THIS NIGHTMARE.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.033
I DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE
WITH THIS NIGHTMARE.

04:00.067 --> 04:02.269
I'LL DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING,

04:02.302 --> 04:05.639
WHAT GORDON RAMSAY
ASKS ME TO DO

04:05.672 --> 04:10.878
TO MAKE THIS PLACE
SUCCESSFUL.

04:10.911 --> 04:14.381
IRONICALLY, GORDON'S SUCCESSFUL
NEW YORK RESTAURANT

04:14.415 --> 04:16.917
IS ONLY TWO BLOCKS AWAY
FROM THIS KITCHEN NIGHTMARE.

04:18.852 --> 04:20.954
DILLONS WITH A CANOPY
ALL TAPED DOWN

04:20.988 --> 04:23.857
AND WHAT THE
IS THAT SIGN THERE?

04:23.891 --> 04:25.225
IT'S LIKE A SCOREBOARD.

04:28.028 --> 04:29.363
MORNING.
HELLO.

04:29.396 --> 04:30.000
GORDON RAMSAY--
MARTIN, GENERAL MANAGER.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.198
GORDON RAMSAY--
MARTIN, GENERAL MANAGER.

04:31.231 --> 04:32.299
PLEASE SEE DILLONS--

04:32.332 --> 04:33.367
DILLONS INDIAN RESTAURANT.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.202
INDIAN RESTAURANT, YES.

04:35.235 --> 04:36.937
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
AN INDIAN, DOES IT?

04:36.970 --> 04:38.005
DILLONS.
NO.

04:38.038 --> 04:39.039
NO.
DILLONS--NO.

04:39.072 --> 04:40.541
WHEN I FIRST MET GORDON,

04:40.574 --> 04:42.509
I ASSUMED HE'D BE
A FAIRLY INTIMIDATING GUY.

04:42.543 --> 04:43.777
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
HE WAS.

04:45.746 --> 04:47.514
MOHAMMAD, HOW ARE YOU?
FINE, THANK YOU.

04:47.548 --> 04:48.749
HELLO.
JENNA.

04:48.782 --> 04:50.517
JENNA, NICE TO SEE YOU.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.352
GORDON DEFINITELY HAS
A PRESENCE ABOUT HIM.

04:52.386 --> 04:53.520
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

04:53.554 --> 04:54.755
I SHOULD BE TERRIFIED

04:54.788 --> 04:56.423
OR JUST RELAX
AND GO WITH EVERYTHING.

04:56.457 --> 04:58.725
THIS IS ANDREW,
OPERATIONS MANAGER.

04:58.759 --> 04:59.993
GENERAL MANAGER,
OPERATIONS MANAGER.

05:00.027 --> 05:01.028
YES.

05:01.061 --> 05:02.663
I HAVE ONE ROCKY TABLE.

05:02.696 --> 05:04.498
TRUST YOU TO PICK
THE WORST TABLE IN THE HOUSE.

05:04.531 --> 05:05.432
LET'S SIT AT THIS TABLE,
SHALL WE?

05:05.466 --> 05:06.733
YEAH?
OKAY.

05:06.767 --> 05:07.801
GOOD.

05:11.805 --> 05:12.906
UH, MARTIN?

05:12.940 --> 05:14.441
YES.

05:14.475 --> 05:15.542
UM, WITH SUCH A HUGE MENU...

05:15.576 --> 05:16.910
HMM.

05:16.944 --> 05:18.912
AM I RIGHT IN THINKING
THERE'S TWO KITCHENS?

05:18.946 --> 05:20.380
THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT CHEFS
IN ONE KITCHEN.

05:20.414 --> 05:22.015
THEY WORK ALONGSIDE
EACH OTHER.

05:22.049 --> 05:24.051
BRITISH, ITALIAN, BUFFALO--

05:24.084 --> 05:25.385
YES.

05:25.419 --> 05:28.155
THE ONLY THING
THAT'S NOT ON HERE IS CHINESE.

05:28.188 --> 05:29.923
ARE YOU NORMALLY
THIS BUSY FOR LUNCH?

05:29.957 --> 05:30.000
OH, ACTUALLY
IT'S A LITTLE BUSY TODAY.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.758
OH, ACTUALLY
IT'S A LITTLE BUSY TODAY.

05:34.027 --> 05:35.829
WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE
COMING IN

05:35.863 --> 05:36.830
BECAUSE THEY SEE
AN EMPTY RESTAURANT.

05:36.864 --> 05:38.799
SOMETIMES I DON'T GET
A TABLE AT ALL.

05:38.832 --> 05:40.501
FROM THE MAIN MENU,

05:40.534 --> 05:42.302
ASSORTED VEGETARIAN APPETIZERS.

05:42.336 --> 05:43.303
AND THEN FOR MAIN COURSE,

05:43.337 --> 05:44.238
THE LAMB BIRYANI

05:44.271 --> 05:45.839
AND BEEF BHUNA.

05:45.873 --> 05:47.508
FROM THE AMERICAN MENU,

05:47.541 --> 05:49.076
I'LL GO FOR THE SALMON NICOISE.

05:49.109 --> 05:50.143
PLEASE,
THANK YOU.

05:50.177 --> 05:51.378
YOU'RE WELCOME.

05:51.411 --> 05:53.347
GOD, I'M LONELY.

05:53.380 --> 05:55.215
I NEED THE APPETIZERS FIRST.

05:55.249 --> 05:56.783
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:56.817 --> 05:58.919
I'M QUITE EXCITED
TO SEE THE REACTION.

05:58.952 --> 06:00.000
GOT, LIKE, GREAT SERVICE,
GREAT FOOD,

06:00.000 --> 06:00.654
GOT, LIKE, GREAT SERVICE,
GREAT FOOD,

06:00.687 --> 06:03.190
SO IT'S A WIN-WIN SITUATION.

06:03.223 --> 06:04.892
THE WALLS ARE GHASTLY.

06:04.925 --> 06:07.995
LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN PLASTERED
WITH HOSPITAL LINEN.

06:08.028 --> 06:09.630
THAT'S WHERE THE CUSTOMERS GO

06:09.663 --> 06:11.098
AFTER THEY COME OUT
OF THIS RESTAURANT.

06:11.131 --> 06:12.866
OF COURSE THERE'S NO
SALMON.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.635
WHY WOULD THERE BE
SALMON?

06:14.668 --> 06:16.303
WHEN GORDON RAMSAY ORDERED
HIS LUNCH,

06:16.336 --> 06:19.139
HE MUST'VE LOOKED IN
TO A  CRYSTAL BALL

06:19.172 --> 06:21.942
'CAUSE HE ORDERED SOMETHING
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE.

06:21.975 --> 06:23.810
LET ME JUST MAKE SURE

06:23.844 --> 06:25.612
THAT I CAN ORDER SOMETHING
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE.

06:30.984 --> 06:32.719
RIGHT.

06:32.753 --> 06:34.054
THERE'S TWO FRITTERS.

06:34.087 --> 06:35.556
THOSE ONES BOTH
ARE VEGETABLE.

06:35.589 --> 06:36.790
THEY'RE BOTH VEGETABLE.

06:36.823 --> 06:37.858
YES.

06:37.891 --> 06:40.260
MAY THE LORD ABOVE
NOT POISON ME.

06:40.294 --> 06:42.329
AMEN.

06:42.362 --> 06:43.830
IN TERMS OF BEAUTY,

06:43.864 --> 06:45.599
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
AN INDIAN CLASSIC, IS IT?

06:45.632 --> 06:47.868
IT LOOKS LIKE
A DEHYDRATED TURD.

06:50.070 --> 06:52.606
THERE'S MEAT IN THERE.

06:52.639 --> 06:55.042
UM, THAT ONE'S GOT MEAT
IN THERE.

06:55.075 --> 06:56.076
IT'S NOT VEGETARIAN.

06:56.109 --> 06:57.878
TASTES LIKE LAMB.

06:57.911 --> 06:59.379
IF HE WERE A VEGETARIAN,

06:59.413 --> 07:00.000
I WOULD EXPECT A LAWSUIT.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.048
I WOULD EXPECT A LAWSUIT.

07:03.850 --> 07:06.820
YOU GUYS ARE KILLING ME
RIGHT NOW.

07:06.853 --> 07:09.856
THE ASSORTED VEGETARIAN
APPETIZER PLATE

07:09.890 --> 07:12.559
HAS TO BE VEGETARIAN.

07:12.593 --> 07:14.595
HE JUST HAD A MEAT ONE.

07:14.628 --> 07:18.899
KNOCK ON WOOD,
THE WORST IS OVER, RIGHT?

07:18.932 --> 07:20.434
OKAY.
THAT'S THE BEEF BHUNA.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.436
BEEF BHUNA.

07:22.469 --> 07:24.404
AND THE LAMB BIRYANI.
LAMB BIRYANI.

07:24.438 --> 07:25.639
AND SHE'S BRINGING
A PLATE FOR YOU.

07:25.672 --> 07:27.441
THANKS, DARLING.

07:27.474 --> 07:28.976
WOULD YOU, UH...

07:29.009 --> 07:30.000
WOULD YOU MIND GETTING ME
A CLEAN ONE, PLEASE?

07:30.000 --> 07:30.978
WOULD YOU MIND GETTING ME
A CLEAN ONE, PLEASE?

07:31.011 --> 07:33.547
SORRY.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.349
WHAT THE  IS THAT?

07:35.382 --> 07:38.285
IT ALWAYS WORRIES ME
WHEN THEY STICK TOMATO ROSES

07:38.318 --> 07:41.321
ON TOP OF FOOD
AND THE TOMATO'S ROTTEN.

07:49.997 --> 07:52.566
THAT IS NOT A PIECE OF BEEF

07:52.599 --> 07:54.501
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE A PIECE
OF BEEF TO YOU, MY DARLING?

07:54.534 --> 07:57.104
IT'S DRY.
IT LOOKS LIKE PORK.

07:57.137 --> 07:58.605
IF THAT'S BEEF,

07:58.639 --> 08:00.000
THEN I WAS BORN
IN BANGLADESH.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.075
THEN I WAS BORN
IN BANGLADESH.

08:02.109 --> 08:03.143
GOMEZ?

08:03.176 --> 08:04.444
YEAH?

08:04.478 --> 08:06.079
HE SAYS TO TRY THIS.
IT'S PORK.

08:06.113 --> 08:07.681
PRETTY SURE IT'S PORK.

08:07.714 --> 08:09.249
THE BEEF?

08:12.753 --> 08:13.887
PORK.

08:13.920 --> 08:14.721
NO.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.356
IT WAS LAMB.

08:16.390 --> 08:18.258
SO NOW IT WAS LAMB.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.861
GORDON DIDN'T SEEM TO ENJOY
MUCH OF ANYTHING.

08:20.894 --> 08:23.196
AND THAT'S HOW IT USUALLY GOES
WITH CUSTOMERS.

08:23.230 --> 08:24.931
WHERE DO YOU START
ON THIS ONE?

08:24.965 --> 08:26.400
THE POTATOES ARE SICK, MARTIN.

08:26.433 --> 08:27.601
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY WERE COOKED

08:27.634 --> 08:28.602
AT LEAST A WEEK AGO.

08:30.604 --> 08:32.172
AND FROZEN SALMON TOO.

08:32.205 --> 08:33.807
ANDREW, THAT'S GOOD.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.876
YOU HAVE COME TO THE RESCUE
ONCE AGAIN.

08:35.909 --> 08:38.478
ONE OF THE GREATEST CHEFS
IN THE WORLD

08:38.512 --> 08:40.380
WANTS SOMETHING TO EAT,

08:40.414 --> 08:42.215
AND I HAD TO MAKE IT.

08:42.249 --> 08:44.184
THANK YOU.

08:44.217 --> 08:46.253
SO THIS IS FROM
THE AMERICAN KITCHEN.

08:47.521 --> 08:49.189
LOOKS LIKE A DOORMAT.

08:49.222 --> 08:51.224
ANOTHER FLY.

08:53.193 --> 08:54.461
UH, IS THIS NORMAL?

08:54.494 --> 08:55.796
UM...

08:55.829 --> 08:56.897
YES, IT IS.

08:56.930 --> 08:57.898
WHO MADE THIS?

08:57.931 --> 08:59.132
UM, I DID.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.000
SO YOU'RE
THE OPERATIONS MANAGER.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.701
SO YOU'RE
THE OPERATIONS MANAGER.

09:00.734 --> 09:02.402
YES.
YOU'RE THE CHEF AS WELL?

09:02.436 --> 09:03.670
YES.

09:03.704 --> 09:05.205
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY OTHER CHEFS
IN THE BACK

09:05.238 --> 09:06.339
THAT CAN COOK THIS FOOD?

09:06.373 --> 09:07.741
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK
ANY WESTERN STYLE FOOD.

09:07.774 --> 09:08.775
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
YES.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.745
JUST...EAT THAT.

09:11.778 --> 09:13.647
NOT WITH PLEASURE.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.582
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING
THAT COULD GO WRONG

09:15.615 --> 09:18.085
WENT HORRIBLY
AND CATASTROPHICALLY WRONG.

09:18.118 --> 09:19.519
OH, GOD!

09:22.289 --> 09:23.523
CALLISTUS?
YEAH.

09:23.557 --> 09:25.025
PLEASE TO MEET YOU.
GORDON.

09:25.058 --> 09:26.893
TELL HIM IN A REALLY NICE WAY

09:26.927 --> 09:28.395
"YOUR FOOD IS."

09:30.464 --> 09:31.498
THE FOOD WAS BLAND.

09:31.531 --> 09:32.999
OLD-FASHIONED.

09:33.033 --> 09:34.534
I'VE EATEN IT.
I DON'T FEEL TOO GOOD.

09:37.104 --> 09:38.705
WHAT HE SAYS IS THAT

09:38.739 --> 09:40.674
THAT LAMB IS PROBABLY
THE OLD LAMB.

09:40.707 --> 09:42.109
YOU SERVED ME OLD LAMB?

09:51.118 --> 09:52.452
MADE A MISTAKE?

10:03.797 --> 10:06.700
COMING UP, GORDON'S NIGHTMARES
ARE REALIZED,

10:06.733 --> 10:08.668
THAT IS POISON.

10:08.702 --> 10:10.837
AS HE TAKES A LOOK
INSIDE THIS KITCHEN.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.672
GREEN BURGERS KILL PEOPLE!

10:12.706 --> 10:14.908
WILL ANDREW AND MARTIN
SURVIVE THE NIGHT?

10:14.941 --> 10:16.409
I'VE NEVER MET
A GENERAL MANAGER

10:16.443 --> 10:18.411
SO  AS YOU.

10:18.445 --> 10:21.715
AND LATER, WHAT FILTH
WILL GORDON FIND LURKING BELOW?

10:21.748 --> 10:23.049
OH, MY GOD!

10:23.083 --> 10:24.584
WHAT DO WE NEED,
A DEATH IN THE RESTAURANT

10:24.618 --> 10:26.219
BEFORE SOME
GETS A GRIP?

10:26.253 --> 10:28.188
THAT'S COMING UP
ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.</i>

10:35.682 --> 10:37.781
AFTER GORDON'S
LUNCHTIME FIASCO,

10:37.781 --> 10:39.816
HE NOW TRIES TO UNDERSTAND

10:39.850 --> 10:42.219
HOW THIS RESTAURANT
IS MANAGED.

10:42.252 --> 10:43.954
NO, I'M NOT WORTHY
OF SPARKLING WATER.

10:43.987 --> 10:45.489
I HAVE TAP WATER HERE.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.625
ARE WE GONNA RESET
THIS TABLE?

10:48.658 --> 10:50.026
EENIE MEENIE MINY MOE,

10:50.060 --> 10:51.728
CATCH A MANAGER
BY THE TOE.

10:51.762 --> 10:53.063
YOU ARE WHAT?
ON THE FLOOR.

10:53.096 --> 10:54.164
YOU'RE THE FLOOR MANAGER.

10:54.197 --> 10:55.565
FLOOR MANAGER.
HOLY MACKEREL.

10:55.599 --> 10:57.434
WHEN I CAME TO WORK,

10:57.467 --> 10:59.903
I WAS NERVOUS,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME

10:59.936 --> 10:59.996
I WAS HAPPY BECAUSE
I HAVE A CHANCE

10:59.996 --> 11:01.371
I WAS HAPPY BECAUSE
I HAVE A CHANCE

11:01.404 --> 11:02.806
TO WORK WITH CHEF RAMSAY.

11:05.942 --> 11:06.943
YOU THINK IT'S THAT FUNNY

11:06.977 --> 11:08.211
AND EASY TO DO?

11:09.379 --> 11:11.014
EVERYBODY HERE HATES KHAN.

11:11.047 --> 11:13.083
AND I CAN'T FIRE THE GUY,

11:13.116 --> 11:15.152
BECAUSE HE'S PROTECTED
BY MOHAMMAD.

11:15.185 --> 11:16.553
NOW WE HAVE A FLOOR MANAGER,

11:16.586 --> 11:18.155
OPERATIONS MANAGER,

11:18.188 --> 11:21.424
AND GENERAL MANAGER.

11:21.458 --> 11:22.726
I WAS RESTING,

11:22.759 --> 11:24.261
JUST THINKING OF VARIOUS THINGS

11:24.294 --> 11:26.296
I'VE GOT TO SORT OUT.

11:26.329 --> 11:28.198
ONE OF THE WAITRESSES
WAS RUBBING MY HAIR.

11:28.231 --> 11:29.996
IT WAS A NATURAL THING.

11:29.996 --> 11:30.000
IT WAS A NATURAL THING.

11:30.033 --> 11:32.035
HOW MANY MANAGERS
DOES THIS PLACE NEED?

11:32.068 --> 11:33.303
I FOUND A NEW MANAGER.

11:33.336 --> 11:34.604
WE NOW HAVE A FLOOR MANAGER,

11:34.638 --> 11:36.006
AMONGST THE OPERATION MANAGER

11:36.039 --> 11:37.641
THAT'S MANAGED BY
THE GENERAL MANAGER.

11:37.674 --> 11:41.178
THREE  MANAGERS
AND THEY'RE ALL.

11:41.211 --> 11:43.013
DEAR, OH, DEAR!

11:43.046 --> 11:45.816
WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF THE STAFF STRUCTURE,

11:45.849 --> 11:47.417
IT'S TIME FOR GORDON
TO SEE THE STAFF IN ACTION

11:47.450 --> 11:49.419
AT A DINNER SERVICE.

11:49.452 --> 11:52.189
WELCOME.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

11:52.222 --> 11:53.456
ARE YOU STILL LOOKING
OVER THE MENU?

12:00.497 --> 12:01.932
THE INDIAN'S VERY GOOD.

12:01.965 --> 12:03.533
WHAT ARE WE CHOOSING FROM?
WHICH MENU?

12:03.567 --> 12:05.468
IT'S ALSO BECOMING CLEAR
TO GORDON

12:05.502 --> 12:07.304
THAT THE MULTIPLE STYLES
OF MENU

12:07.337 --> 12:09.206
IS NOT A POSITIVE,
BUT A NEGATIVE.

12:12.008 --> 12:12.943
THANK YOU.

12:15.846 --> 12:17.948
OKAY, READY?

12:17.981 --> 12:20.183
OKAY, FAROUK,

12:20.217 --> 12:22.752
OH, ,
HOLY MOSES.

12:22.786 --> 12:24.054
OH, DEAR.

12:25.121 --> 12:26.756
ME.

12:28.925 --> 12:29.996
LIFT IT OFF THE FLOOR

12:29.996 --> 12:30.360
LIFT IT OFF THE FLOOR

12:30.393 --> 12:32.262
AND DON'T PUT IT
ON THE FLOOR.

12:32.295 --> 12:33.630
HELLO, MADAM.

12:33.663 --> 12:34.698
FLOOR MANAGER?

12:34.731 --> 12:36.099
OPERATIONS MANAGER?

12:36.132 --> 12:37.934
GENERAL MANAGER?

12:37.968 --> 12:39.569
ANYBODY?

12:39.603 --> 12:42.906
MOHAMMAD, CAN YOU EXPLAIN
TO GOMEZ--

12:42.939 --> 12:43.874
YES.

12:43.907 --> 12:45.175
THAT WE'VE GOT TO STOP

12:45.208 --> 12:46.610
PUTTING THINGS ON THE FLOOR.

12:46.643 --> 12:48.378
YES?

12:48.411 --> 12:50.814
IT'S UNHYGIENIC.

12:50.847 --> 12:53.416
UNHYGIENIC AND IT COULD
BE DANGEROUS TOO.

12:53.450 --> 12:54.651
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

12:54.684 --> 12:57.487
DEAR, OH DEAR, OH DEAR.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.656
IT'S 40 MINUTES
INTO THE SERVICE,

12:59.689 --> 12:59.996
AND UNBELIEVABLY NO FOOD
HAS LEFT THE KITCHEN.

12:59.996 --> 13:02.425
AND UNBELIEVABLY NO FOOD
HAS LEFT THE KITCHEN.

13:02.459 --> 13:04.661
MY FIRST TABLE STILL
HASN'T GOTTEN HER ENTREE.

13:08.131 --> 13:10.600
ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS

13:10.634 --> 13:12.202
KITCHEN CHAOS.

13:19.843 --> 13:21.578
WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?

13:21.611 --> 13:23.546
I'M TAKING OVER
EXPEDITING HERE.

13:23.580 --> 13:25.015
- YOU'RE EXPEDITING?
- YES.

13:25.048 --> 13:26.082
MOHAMMAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

13:27.484 --> 13:29.252
YOU'VE GOT THREE MANAGERS,
TWO CHEFS,

13:29.286 --> 13:29.996
EIGHT GIRLS OUT
AT THE FRONT

13:29.996 --> 13:30.954
EIGHT GIRLS OUT
AT THE FRONT

13:30.987 --> 13:33.189
AND NO ONE CAN
DELEGATE.

13:33.223 --> 13:34.891
OH, MY GOD.

13:34.925 --> 13:37.827
OKAY KIDS--

13:37.861 --> 13:39.729
LET EVERYBODY KNOW.

13:39.763 --> 13:41.998
AND WHEN INFORMATION
IS SHOUTED FROM THE KITCHEN,

13:42.032 --> 13:43.700
MARTIN IS BUSY AGAIN.

13:43.733 --> 13:46.236
NOT WITH CUSTOMERS,
BUT WITH HIS PHONE.

13:46.269 --> 13:48.271
OH, MY GOD.

13:48.305 --> 13:51.508
OKAY, THAT HAS TO BE READY
BEFORE THIS GOES UP.

13:51.541 --> 13:53.276
ULTIMATELY,
MARTIN DOESN'T BELONG

13:53.310 --> 13:54.945
IN A LEADERSHIP POSITION.

13:58.014 --> 13:59.416
THIS PLACE IS RUNNING
IN CHAOS.

13:59.449 --> 13:59.996
IT'S TOTALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL.

13:59.996 --> 14:00.784
IT'S TOTALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL.

14:00.817 --> 14:02.319
AND THERE NEEDS
TO BE LEADERSHIP HERE.

14:02.352 --> 14:04.454
SO WHAT
ARE YOU COOKING TONIGHT?

14:05.722 --> 14:06.690
NOTHING.

14:06.723 --> 14:07.857
NOTHING AT ALL?

14:07.891 --> 14:09.025
UH-UH.

14:09.059 --> 14:10.360
GET ME THE GENERAL MANAGER,
MARTIN, PLEASE.

14:10.393 --> 14:12.295
ALL RIGHT.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.831
MARTIN!

14:14.864 --> 14:17.634
GORDON RAMSAY WAS REALLY
GETTING UNDER MY SKIN.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.069
OKAY, RIGHT.

14:19.102 --> 14:20.103
THIS YOUNG MAN'S HERE.

14:20.136 --> 14:21.237
HE'S STANDING HERE,

14:21.271 --> 14:22.472
AND HE HAS NOTHING TO COOK.

14:22.505 --> 14:24.040
IS THIS HOW YOU RUN
A PLACE?

14:25.842 --> 14:27.677
WHY DID IT TAKE ME
TO LET YOU KNOW

14:27.711 --> 14:29.379
THAT HE'S STANDING THERE
PLAYING WITH RADISHES.

14:29.412 --> 14:29.996
BECAUSE, UM...

14:29.996 --> 14:31.014
BECAUSE, UM...

14:31.047 --> 14:32.382
YOU'RE BUSY.

14:35.485 --> 14:37.153
AH,.

14:37.187 --> 14:38.588
HE WAS ALLUDING
TO MY RELATIONSHIP

14:38.621 --> 14:39.689
WITH THE WAITRESSES.

14:39.723 --> 14:40.790
YOU GET OFF ON IT.

14:40.824 --> 14:42.025
GIRLS STROKING YOUR HAIR.

14:42.058 --> 14:45.628
MASSAGING YOUR  EGO.

14:45.662 --> 14:47.364
YOU'RE SUCH A FAKE!

14:47.397 --> 14:48.999
I'M NOT FAKE,
I'M JUST--

14:49.032 --> 14:51.034
WHY--WHY ARE YOU SAYING
I'M A FAKE?

14:51.067 --> 14:52.569
YOU'VE GOT MEMBERS
OF YOUR TEAM

14:52.602 --> 14:53.670
STANDING HERE
GETTING PAID,

14:53.703 --> 14:55.338
DOING  ALL.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.806
I'VE NEVER MET A GENERAL MANAGER

14:56.840 --> 14:58.508
SO  AS YOU!

14:58.541 --> 14:59.509
OH, OKAY.

14:59.542 --> 14:59.996
IF THIS WAS YOUR MONEY,

14:59.996 --> 15:01.244
IF THIS WAS YOUR MONEY,

15:01.277 --> 15:02.979
WOULD YOU LET HIM STAND HERE
PLAYING WITH HIS?

15:03.013 --> 15:03.747
THAT'S WHAT
YOU WERE DOING HERE, ISN'T IT?

15:03.780 --> 15:05.448
YOU'RE RIDING MOHAMMAD.

15:05.482 --> 15:06.750
YOU'RE SKINNING THAT POOR MAN.

15:06.783 --> 15:08.284
YES, YOU  ARE.

15:08.318 --> 15:10.053
YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF A WEAK RICH MAN.

15:10.086 --> 15:11.688
THAT'S WHAT JUST
CLICKED IN MY MIND.

15:11.721 --> 15:13.289
HE GOT PERSONAL.

15:13.323 --> 15:14.457
HE WAS ACCUSING ME
OF RIDING MOHAMMAD.

15:14.491 --> 15:15.458
THIS TYPE OF THING.

15:15.492 --> 15:16.626
AND THAT GOT ME,

15:16.659 --> 15:18.194
BECAUSE HOW THE HELL

15:18.228 --> 15:20.163
HAVE YOU GOT THE RIGHT
TO SAY SOMETHING TO ME.

15:20.196 --> 15:21.598
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

15:21.631 --> 15:23.266
WE GOT MORE STAFF
THAN CUSTOMERS TONIGHT

15:23.299 --> 15:25.335
AND WE STILL CAN'T GET IT
RIGHT.

15:25.368 --> 15:28.738
GENERAL MANAGER.

15:28.772 --> 15:29.996
GENERAL TOSS POT.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.441
GENERAL TOSS POT.

15:31.474 --> 15:32.575
WHAT IS GOING ON BACK THERE?

15:35.211 --> 15:37.580
AN HOUR AND A HALF
INTO DINNER SERVICE,

15:37.614 --> 15:40.517
AND ONLY A FEW DISHES HAVE
MADE THEIR WAY TO CUSTOMERS,

15:40.550 --> 15:42.318
WHO ARE NOT EXACTLY THRILLED

15:42.352 --> 15:44.921
WITH DILLONS DINING EXPERIENCE.

15:44.954 --> 15:46.556
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15:50.193 --> 15:51.995
AND THOSE WHO HAVEN'T
RECEIVED FOOD

15:52.028 --> 15:53.296
ARE GETTING READY TO LEAVE.

15:53.329 --> 15:54.531
IN TWO MINUTES, WE'RE LEAVING.

15:54.564 --> 15:56.066
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE ASKED--

15:56.099 --> 15:58.101
SERIOUSLY, TWO MINUTES
WE'RE LEAVING.

15:58.134 --> 15:59.302
WHAT ELSE I CAN DO FOR YOU
RIGHT NOW

15:59.335 --> 15:59.869
SO THAT WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY?

15:59.903 --> 15:59.996
YOU TELL ME.

15:59.996 --> 16:01.237
YOU TELL ME.

16:01.271 --> 16:02.972
I'M SORRY, LADIES.

16:03.006 --> 16:03.973
I CAN DISCOUNT YOUR BILL
AND YOU CAN GO.

16:18.154 --> 16:19.856
IT'S DAY TWO AND GORDON

16:19.889 --> 16:21.524
HAS ALREADY BEEN APPALLED
BY THE FOOD

16:21.558 --> 16:24.761
AND DISMAYED
BY THE INADEQUATE MANAGEMENT.

16:24.794 --> 16:26.463
TIME TO DO THE THING
I'VE BEEN DREADING MOST, YEAH?

16:26.496 --> 16:27.897
GETTING INTO THE KITCHEN.

16:27.931 --> 16:29.996
I AM NOT LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS PART.

16:29.996 --> 16:30.333
I AM NOT LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS PART.

16:33.636 --> 16:34.871
WHEN WERE THESE CHANGED LAST?

16:34.904 --> 16:36.139
UM, THAT ONE...

16:36.172 --> 16:38.741
WELL, AT LEAST THE FLIES
LOOK FRESH.

16:38.775 --> 16:40.176
OH, MY GOD.

16:40.210 --> 16:41.945
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY IS THE FLIES.

16:41.978 --> 16:43.713
THERE IS A LOT OF FLIES HERE.

16:46.549 --> 16:47.984
WHAT IS THAT?

16:48.017 --> 16:49.052
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

16:49.085 --> 16:50.220
YOU DON'T KNOW.

16:50.253 --> 16:52.255
MOLDY.

16:52.288 --> 16:54.224
THAT IS QUITE FRANKLY
THE WORST HAMBURGER

16:54.257 --> 16:56.292
I'VE EVER SEEN
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

16:56.326 --> 16:58.428
OH, MY GOD.

16:58.461 --> 16:59.996
THESE WERE MY
POTATOES FOR LUNCH.

16:59.996 --> 17:00.964
THESE WERE MY
POTATOES FOR LUNCH.

17:00.997 --> 17:02.232
DO ME A FAVOR.

17:02.265 --> 17:03.233
YES.

17:03.266 --> 17:05.702
EAT THAT.

17:05.735 --> 17:07.036
THANK GOD I SAT
THE LITTLE  DOWN

17:07.070 --> 17:08.271
TO EAT THEM.

17:08.304 --> 17:10.039
THAT'S NOT A POTATO.

17:10.073 --> 17:11.174
GREEN CHICKEN.

17:20.116 --> 17:21.217
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

17:21.251 --> 17:24.721
FOR GOD'S SAKE!

17:24.754 --> 17:26.322
LOOK AT THAT!

17:26.356 --> 17:28.391
LOOK!

17:28.424 --> 17:29.559
COCKROACHES!

17:29.592 --> 17:29.996
HOLY!

17:29.996 --> 17:31.728
HOLY!

17:40.382 --> 17:41.461
OH, MY GOD!

17:41.461 --> 17:43.321
THAT IS THE WORST HAMBURGER

17:43.321 --> 17:45.323
I'VE EVER SEEN
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

17:45.356 --> 17:46.557
HAVING DISCOVERED
THE TERRIBLE CONDITIONS

17:46.591 --> 17:47.925
IN THE KITCHEN,

17:47.959 --> 17:50.261
GORDON NOW VENTURES
DOWN TO THE BASEMENT

17:50.294 --> 17:51.629
OF THE RESTAURANT

17:51.663 --> 17:53.231
TO CHECK OUT
WHAT'S LURKING BELOW.

17:53.264 --> 17:55.566
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

17:55.600 --> 17:57.702
WHAT?

17:57.735 --> 17:59.604
WHAT IS THAT?

17:59.637 --> 18:01.506
IS THAT FOR RATS
OR MICE?

18:03.241 --> 18:04.987
SO WE HAVE GOT RATS HERE.

18:04.987 --> 18:06.911
SO WE HAVE GOT RATS HERE.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.687
THERE'S RAT DROPPINGS.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.488
LOOK AT THEM ALL!
EVERYWHERE!

18:17.522 --> 18:19.524
RATS.
RATS.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.559
OH, MY GOOD GOD.

18:21.592 --> 18:23.995
LOOK AT THE COCKROACHES.

18:24.028 --> 18:25.596
OH, MY GOD--LOOK.

18:25.630 --> 18:26.931
I'VE GOT ONE
IN MY  HAIR.

18:26.964 --> 18:27.999
IT'S COCKROACHES.

18:28.032 --> 18:30.001
BOXES FULL OF THEM.

18:30.034 --> 18:32.904
LOOK!

18:32.937 --> 18:34.987
LOOK AT THEM ALL!

18:34.987 --> 18:36.507
LOOK AT THEM ALL!

18:36.541 --> 18:37.642
OH, MY GOD!
LOOK.

18:37.675 --> 18:38.743
THERE THEY ARE THERE,

18:38.776 --> 18:40.745
IN REFRIGERATION.

18:40.778 --> 18:43.147
OH,  NO.

18:43.181 --> 18:44.716
OH, MY GOD.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.218
OH, NO!

18:47.251 --> 18:49.220
LOOK AT THAT!

18:49.253 --> 18:51.222
OH, MY GOD!

18:51.255 --> 18:53.791
LOOK AT THEM.

18:53.825 --> 18:56.160
THERE YOU GO.

18:56.194 --> 18:58.830
THERE YOU GO.

18:58.863 --> 19:00.932
IT'S LIKE A NIGHTMARE.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.867
LOOK, MOHAMMAD--

19:02.900 --> 19:04.635
I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVEN
A PEPPER.

19:04.669 --> 19:04.987
IT'S ROTTEN.

19:04.987 --> 19:06.204
IT'S ROTTEN.

19:06.237 --> 19:08.239
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THE FLIES IN THE DINING ROOM.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.141
I KNOW WHERE THEY'RE
BREEDING NOW.

19:10.174 --> 19:12.243
LOOK AT IT!

19:12.276 --> 19:13.411
I'VE EATEN HERE!

19:13.444 --> 19:15.480
COME ON!

19:15.513 --> 19:17.348
MARTIN!

19:17.381 --> 19:18.649
WE'LL MISS YOU.

19:18.683 --> 19:20.818
HOPEFULLY SEE YOU SOON.
TAKE CARE, BYE.

19:22.854 --> 19:24.555
OKAY, YEAH,
I NEED MARTIN URGENTLY.

19:24.589 --> 19:25.490
HE'S THE GENERAL MANAGER,
YES?

19:25.523 --> 19:27.125
YEAH, GOOD.

19:27.158 --> 19:28.760
YOU'RE--YOU'RE NEEDED
RIGHT NOW.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.128
I'M NEEDED RIGHT NOW?

19:30.161 --> 19:32.230
YES, NEEDED IN THE KITCHEN
URGENTLY.

19:32.263 --> 19:33.598
ARE YOU IN CHARGE OF THIS?

19:33.631 --> 19:34.987
ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS?

19:34.987 --> 19:35.900
ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS?

19:35.933 --> 19:38.903
THAT IS THE SALAD
THAT I HAD--LUNCHTIME.

19:38.936 --> 19:41.672
AS I OPEN THE BAG AND BANG--
OUT COME THE FLIES.

19:41.706 --> 19:43.407
UH, GENTLEMEN, IT GETS WORSE
THAN THAT.

19:43.441 --> 19:45.877
IT'S GREEN.

19:45.910 --> 19:48.579
IT'S BEYOND EDIBLE.

19:48.613 --> 19:50.081
IT'S DISGUSTING!

19:50.114 --> 19:54.352
LOOK AT THE COLOR
OF THOSE CHICKEN WINGS.

19:54.385 --> 19:56.220
EVERYTHING IN THERE WAS PUTRID.

19:56.254 --> 19:58.556
HOW LONG HAS THAT BEEN
IN THERE?

19:58.589 --> 20:00.858
GIVE ME AN ANSWER
BECAUSE I'M  MYSELF.

20:00.892 --> 20:02.193
YES, UH,
THERE'S A HEAD CHEF

20:02.226 --> 20:03.895
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

20:03.928 --> 20:04.987
TRY TO RECTIFY IT--
THIS WILL KILL SOMEBODY.

20:04.987 --> 20:05.763
TRY TO RECTIFY IT--
THIS WILL KILL SOMEBODY.

20:05.797 --> 20:08.399
I'M NOT PASSING THE BUCK,
BUT...

20:08.432 --> 20:09.934
I KNOW MY GENERAL MANAGER

20:09.967 --> 20:11.602
KNOWS WHAT THE
GOES ON IN MY FRIDGES.

20:11.636 --> 20:13.037
WHERE ARE YOUR STANDARDS?

20:13.070 --> 20:15.406
OUR STANDARDS ARE--
LOOK AT IT!

20:15.439 --> 20:16.774
LET ME JUST TELL YOU
SOMETHING.
YES.

20:16.808 --> 20:18.109
I'VE EATEN HERE!

20:18.142 --> 20:20.912
WHEN'S THAT FROM?

20:20.945 --> 20:22.647
THAT'S BEEN SLICED.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.816
THAT'S GONE OUT.
WHAT IS THAT--WHERE IS IT--

20:24.849 --> 20:26.784
HEY, MADAM.
WHERE'S THAT TOMATO GONE?

20:28.920 --> 20:31.022
LOOK, IT'S  ROTTEN,

20:31.055 --> 20:32.690
YOU  IDIOT.

20:32.723 --> 20:34.987
IT'S ROTTEN!

20:34.987 --> 20:35.326
IT'S ROTTEN!

20:39.797 --> 20:41.065
NO, NO, NO.

20:41.098 --> 20:41.766
SO WHERE IS IT?

20:41.799 --> 20:43.201
OH, MY GOD.

20:46.571 --> 20:49.207
THINGS ARE LOOKING PRETTY GLUM.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.975
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK!

20:51.008 --> 20:52.410
LOOK!

20:52.443 --> 20:54.879
IT'S ROTTEN, MOHAMMAD!

20:54.912 --> 20:58.850
TELL HIM IN YOUR LANGUAGE
HE'LL KILL SOMEBODY!

20:58.883 --> 20:59.984
WHAT DO WE NEED,

21:00.017 --> 21:01.452
A DEATH IN THE RESTAURANT

21:01.485 --> 21:04.589
BEFORE SOME
GETS A GRIP?

21:04.622 --> 21:04.987
HOW MANY TABLES
ARE OUT THERE?

21:04.987 --> 21:05.957
HOW MANY TABLES
ARE OUT THERE?

21:05.990 --> 21:07.391
THERE'S THREE.
THREE.

21:07.425 --> 21:09.060
YOU TELL THOSE THREE TABLES

21:09.093 --> 21:10.995
THIS IS LUCKIEST DAY
OF THEIR  LIVES.

21:11.028 --> 21:14.198
OKAY?

21:14.232 --> 21:15.566
THE ONLY THING WORSE

21:15.600 --> 21:17.268
THAN HAVING TABLES SENT AWAY

21:17.301 --> 21:18.836
IS KNOWING THAT WHAT I WAS
GOING TO SERVE THEM

21:18.870 --> 21:20.271
COULD MAKE THEM SICK.

21:20.304 --> 21:21.873
NO ONE IS GETTING SERVED

21:21.906 --> 21:23.507
ON THIS  RESTAURANT
TONIGHT.

21:23.541 --> 21:25.076
LET'S MAKE THAT CLEAR.

21:25.109 --> 21:26.878
YES OR NO?
ANYONE AGAINST THAT?

21:26.911 --> 21:28.079
NO.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.647
NO--GOOD.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.115
THAT DIDN'T GO DOWN TOO WELL.

21:31.148 --> 21:32.683
HE WAS EXTREMELY ANGRY,
EXTREMELY PISSED OFF.

21:32.717 --> 21:34.987
WE ARE NOT...EVER AGAIN

21:34.987 --> 21:37.088
WE ARE NOT...EVER AGAIN

21:37.121 --> 21:38.656
SERVING ANY OF THIS FOOD.

21:38.689 --> 21:40.191
I DON'T GIVE A
WHAT ANYONE SAYS.

21:40.224 --> 21:42.526
CAN YOU GO AND TELL THEM

21:42.560 --> 21:44.528
THAT THE KITCHEN IS CLOSED
RIGHT NOW.

21:44.562 --> 21:46.764
OUT THERE AND TELL THEM
THE TRUTH.

21:46.797 --> 21:48.132
TELL THEM NOW!

21:48.165 --> 21:50.368
GORDON WAS SO OUTRAGED.

21:50.401 --> 21:53.204
SO ANGRY.

21:53.237 --> 21:55.306
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT.

21:55.339 --> 21:57.608
GREEN BURGERS TO
FURRY CUCUMBER

21:57.642 --> 21:59.310
TO
ROTTEN POTATOES.

21:59.343 --> 22:00.311
OUT THERE!
HELLO.

22:00.344 --> 22:01.312
HI.

22:01.345 --> 22:03.080
I'M SORRY TO INFORM YOU

22:03.114 --> 22:04.987
THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE
SERVING DINNER THIS EVENING.

22:04.987 --> 22:05.583
THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE
SERVING DINNER THIS EVENING.

22:05.616 --> 22:09.687
CHEF RAMSAY'S SHUT DOWN
THE KITCHEN.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.255
IT'S JUST DISGRACEFUL.

22:11.289 --> 22:14.225
I FEEL TERRIBLE
THAT IT'S GOTTEN TO THIS POINT.

22:14.258 --> 22:17.428
I'M  SPEECHLESS.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.530
IT IS A NIGHTMARE.

22:19.563 --> 22:20.932
THIS IS SO HORRIBLE.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.566
I SHOULD CLOSE DOWN
THIS PLACE.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.770
THIS IS WORSE THAN A NIGHTMARE.

22:37.007 --> 22:38.448
GORDON HAS ENCOUNTERED

22:38.448 --> 22:40.088
ONE OF THE MOST
DISGUSTING KITCHENS

22:40.088 --> 22:41.089
HE HAS EVER SEEN.

22:41.122 --> 22:43.258
OH, MY GOD!

22:43.291 --> 22:45.460
AND SO HE MUST TAKE
SERIOUS ACTION.

22:47.262 --> 22:49.030
LET'S GO.

22:53.134 --> 22:54.469
I WANT THESE GUYS TO KNOW

22:54.502 --> 22:55.536
I MEAN
BUSINESS.

22:55.570 --> 22:58.339
A CLEAN MEANS A PROPER CLEAN.

23:02.410 --> 23:02.651
RIGHT, YOU DIRTY LITTLE
,

23:02.651 --> 23:04.212
RIGHT, YOU DIRTY LITTLE
,

23:04.245 --> 23:05.313
WHERE ARE YOU?

23:08.616 --> 23:11.953
I WAS JUST LOOKING AT HIM...

23:11.986 --> 23:14.188
AND THINKING...

23:14.222 --> 23:16.291
OKAY, WHEN I SAY "CLEAN,"

23:16.324 --> 23:18.126
I MEAN "CLEAN," YEAH?
GUYS!

23:18.159 --> 23:20.028
LET'S GO!

23:20.061 --> 23:25.533
THESE GUYS ARE PROFESSIONAL
STEAM CLEANERS, YEAH?

23:25.566 --> 23:28.303
GUYS, KITCHEN'S STRAIGHT
THROUGH THERE.

23:28.336 --> 23:29.804
IT WASN'T JUST CLEANERS;

23:29.837 --> 23:31.272
IT WAS CLEANERS PLUS.

23:31.306 --> 23:32.651
THEY WERE DRESSED LIKE PEOPLE

23:32.651 --> 23:32.774
THEY WERE DRESSED LIKE PEOPLE

23:32.807 --> 23:34.976
FROM STAR WARS,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

23:35.009 --> 23:37.178
AND YOU GUYS ARE DOING IT
WITH THEM, YEAH?

23:37.211 --> 23:38.980
OH, GOD.

23:43.785 --> 23:45.687
TO SEEK OUT AND DESTROY

23:45.720 --> 23:49.123
ALL MOLDY, ROTTEN,
AND CONTAMINATED FOODS.

23:49.157 --> 23:51.059
WE GOT WORK TO DO.

23:51.092 --> 23:53.695
THE NEXT PHASE
OF OPERATION STERILIZE,

23:53.728 --> 23:56.497
STEAM CLEAN EVERY SQUARE INCH
OF THE KITCHEN.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.102
NOW IT'S TIME
TO ENLIGHTEN MOHAMMAD

24:01.135 --> 24:02.651
AND HIS MANAGERS
WITH A LITTLE TRIP

24:02.651 --> 24:02.904
AND HIS MANAGERS
WITH A LITTLE TRIP

24:02.937 --> 24:04.505
A COUPLE OF BLOCKS AWAY

24:04.539 --> 24:06.841
TO THE KITCHEN OF GORDON'S
NEW YORK RESTAURANT.

24:06.874 --> 24:08.843
OKAY, I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

24:08.876 --> 24:12.246
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
NIGHT AND DAY.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.582
THIS IS A KITCHEN.

24:17.385 --> 24:19.454
HAVE A LOOK AROUND.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.329
GORDON'S KITCHEN
IS ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR.

24:28.363 --> 24:30.732
NO MATTER WHAT SIZE RESTAURANT
YOU ARE,

24:30.765 --> 24:32.133
YOU CAN KEEP A CLEAN SHOP

24:32.166 --> 24:32.651
AND YOU CAN KEEP IT
ORGANIZED.

24:32.651 --> 24:33.468
AND YOU CAN KEEP IT
ORGANIZED.

24:33.501 --> 24:37.005
OPEN THE FRIDGE DOOR,
MARTIN.

24:37.038 --> 24:38.940
WE WENT TO THE LONDON.

24:38.973 --> 24:40.508
THAT WAS THE WALK OF SHAME.

24:40.541 --> 24:43.911
TWICE A DAY THESE FRIDGES
ARE CLEANED.

24:43.945 --> 24:45.513
THIS IS HEAVEN,

24:45.546 --> 24:48.750
THAT WAS HELL.

24:53.888 --> 24:55.390
IN ORDER TO REACH OUT

24:55.423 --> 24:56.591
TO THE LOCAL INDIAN COMMUNITY

24:56.624 --> 24:58.126
AND NEW YORKERS AT LARGE,

24:58.159 --> 25:01.195
GORDON HAS COME UP
WITH HIS STRATEGY FOR THE MENU.

25:01.229 --> 25:02.651
CONTEMPORARY INDIAN CUISINE.

25:02.651 --> 25:03.297
CONTEMPORARY INDIAN CUISINE.

25:03.331 --> 25:04.832
DOES HE KNOW WE'RE ON BROADWAY?

25:04.866 --> 25:05.933
WHERE ARE WE?

25:05.967 --> 25:07.201
NEW JERSEY.
NO, NO--

25:07.235 --> 25:08.770
- NEW JERSEY?
- OH,  ME.

25:08.803 --> 25:10.838
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
WE'RE IN  NEW YORK.

25:12.507 --> 25:13.608
RIGHT.

25:13.641 --> 25:14.876
WITH THIS SALMON,

25:14.909 --> 25:16.544
WE'RE GONNA MAKE
A BIT OF A BROTH

25:16.577 --> 25:18.713
WITH COCONUT AND TOMATOES
AND ONIONS.

25:18.746 --> 25:20.148
RIGHT.

25:20.181 --> 25:22.617
THE SECRET BEHIND THIS COLOR
IS NICE AND PINK--IT'S SWEET.

25:22.650 --> 25:24.786
A LITTLE BIT
OF CURRY POWDER, YES?

25:24.819 --> 25:26.421
YES.
AND THEN FROM THERE,

25:26.454 --> 25:30.391
JUST SIT IT ON TOP
OF THE CHUTNEY.

25:30.425 --> 25:31.526
PAN-SEARED SCALLOPS,

25:31.559 --> 25:32.651
A WALNUT CHUTNEY,

25:32.651 --> 25:33.327
A WALNUT CHUTNEY,

25:33.361 --> 25:35.196
WONDERFUL, CRISPY SALMON

25:35.229 --> 25:37.131
WITH A TOMATO COCONUT
CURRY BROTH.

25:37.165 --> 25:38.933
HE JUST OPENED MY EYES

25:38.966 --> 25:40.568
TO WHAT CAN BE DONE.

25:40.601 --> 25:44.539
CLEAN, MODERN WAY
TO SERVE INDIAN FOOD.

25:44.572 --> 25:45.673
VERY GOOD.

25:45.706 --> 25:46.974
LOOK AT ME--
OH JEEZ.

25:47.008 --> 25:48.109
GIVE ME A CUDDLE ,
OKAY?

25:48.142 --> 25:49.944
VERY, VERY GOOD.

25:52.780 --> 25:54.615
OKAY, OKAY,
YOU CAN LET GO NOW.

25:54.649 --> 25:56.617
HE CAN LET GO NOW.

25:56.651 --> 25:58.586
HE CAN LET  GO NOW!

25:58.619 --> 26:00.321
OKAY, GOOD.

26:04.826 --> 26:07.728
TO HELP EXECUTE
GORDON'S MENU MAKEOVER,

26:07.762 --> 26:09.363
HE HAS ENLISTED THE HELP

26:09.397 --> 26:11.899
OF ONE OF THE TOP INDIAN CHEFS
IN NEW YORK CITY,

26:11.933 --> 26:13.167
VIKAS KHANNA.

26:13.201 --> 26:14.669

26:32.651 --> 26:32.653
GORDON'S DESIGN TEAM

26:32.687 --> 26:33.955
TO DRAMATICALLY TRANSFORM

26:33.988 --> 26:38.292
THE RESTAURANT'S INTERIOR
AND EXTERIOR.

26:38.326 --> 26:39.961
IT'S A NEW DAY.

26:39.994 --> 26:42.964
THE TACKY ELECTRONIC SIGN
IS BEING REMOVED,

26:42.997 --> 26:44.232
AND THE RESTAURANT IS GIVEN

26:44.265 --> 26:45.867

AMAZING JOB.

27:12.894 --> 27:14.262
MOHAMMAD, HAVE A LOOK
FROM DOWN HERE.

27:14.295 --> 27:15.897
WOW.

27:15.930 --> 27:17.198

27:17.231 --> 27:18.232
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

27:18.266 --> 27:19.634
BEAUTIFUL.

27:19.667 --> 27:21.269
IT HAS A NICE CLEAN,
CRISP LOOK.

27:21.302 --> 27:22.904
IT LOOKS NOW LIKE
IT'S BEEN DONE

27:22.937 --> 27:24.405
BY PROFESSIONALS
THE WAY IT SHOULD.

27:24.438 --> 27:25.640
OH, WOW!

27:25.673 --> 27:26.974
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

27:27.008 --> 27:28.576
ISN'T IT LOVELY?

27:28.609 --> 27:29.877
I'M HAPPY TO COME INTO WORK NOW

27:29.911 --> 27:31.245
AND NOT SEE THE MATERIAL.

27:35.950 --> 27:37.785
IT'S SO MUCH MORE
THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE.

27:37.818 --> 27:38.953
NEW CHAIRS,

27:38.986 --> 27:40.288
NEW BANQUETTES,

27:40.321 --> 27:41.522
NEW LINEN,

27:41.556 --> 27:43.024
NEW PICTURES,

27:43.057 --> 27:47.161
AND IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
THAT IS CLASSY, YES?

27:47.195 --> 27:49.697
HE JUST TURNED THIS RESTAURANT
FROM 0 TO 100.

27:49.730 --> 27:51.232
WE'RE GONNA GO OUTSIDE

27:51.265 --> 27:53.201
AND HAVE A QUICK LOOK
OUTSIDE.

27:53.234 --> 27:56.170
WOW, BEAUTIFUL.

27:56.204 --> 27:57.438
WOW!

27:57.471 --> 27:59.340
OH, MY GOD!

28:06.113 --> 28:07.548
STAND BACK A LITTLE BIT.

28:07.582 --> 28:08.583
THERE'S NO CONFUSION.

28:08.616 --> 28:09.584
THE COLOR'S BEAUTIFUL.

28:09.617 --> 28:11.085
YES.

28:11.118 --> 28:12.887
I'M NOT GONNA MISS
THAT SIGN.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.122
I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE IT GONE.

28:15.156 --> 28:17.258
IT LOOKS LIKE A REAL RESTAURANT
AGAIN.

28:17.291 --> 28:19.327
AMAZING JOB.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.062
AFTER WORKING THROUGH
THE NIGHT,

28:21.095 --> 28:22.763
VIKAS IS READY TO PRESENT

28:22.797 --> 28:25.533
THE NEW MENU
HE DESIGNED WITH GORDON.

28:25.566 --> 28:27.068
THE OLD MENU HAS BEEN REPLACED

28:27.101 --> 28:28.669
WITH CLASSIC INDIAN DISHES

28:28.703 --> 28:30.338
THAT HAVE A MODERN TWIST.

28:30.371 --> 28:32.651
EVERYTHING IS DONE
VERY SIMPLE

28:32.651 --> 28:32.673
EVERYTHING IS DONE
VERY SIMPLE

28:32.707 --> 28:34.308
ACCORDING TO AMERICAN PALATE.

28:34.342 --> 28:39.280
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT INDIAN FOOD
LIKE THAT EXISTED.

28:39.313 --> 28:41.282
OKAY,
THAT'S A VERY BASIC CURRY.

28:41.315 --> 28:43.084
WE MOVE TO THE NEXT DISH,
WE HAVE KADHAI SHRIMP HERE.

28:44.218 --> 28:46.854
AFTER THE TRIO,
WE HAVE THE CHICKEN KORMA.

28:46.887 --> 28:48.122
WE'RE USING SAFFRON,

28:48.155 --> 28:49.824
REAL SAFFRON
FOR THIS FLAVOR.

28:49.857 --> 28:52.827
MR. VIKAS IS SO CUTE.

28:52.860 --> 28:55.830
HE IS A MAGICIAN TO ME.

28:55.863 --> 28:59.634
AND GORDON'S RECIPE
OF SAFFRON CAULIFLOWER.

28:59.667 --> 29:01.102
THE MENU REFLECTS THESE VALUES

29:01.135 --> 29:02.651
OF FRESHNESS IN FOOD,

29:02.651 --> 29:02.937
OF FRESHNESS IN FOOD,

29:02.970 --> 29:04.405
VIBRANT FLAVORS,

29:04.438 --> 29:07.041
AND IT'S VERY APPROACHABLE
FOR EVERYONE.

29:11.045 --> 29:14.048
WITH THE KITCHEN, MENU,
AND DECOR

29:14.081 --> 29:15.850
ALL IN GOOD SHAPE,

29:15.883 --> 29:18.019
IT'S TIME FOR GORDON
TO TURN HIS ATTENTION

29:18.052 --> 29:19.153
BACK TO THE STAFF.

29:19.186 --> 29:20.988
BIG, BIG, BIG NIGHT, YES?

29:21.022 --> 29:24.258
THIS PLACE IS ABOUT TO BE
RELAUNCHED PROPERLY.

29:24.292 --> 29:27.061
TONIGHT IT HAS TO WORK,
OKAY?

29:27.094 --> 29:28.629
WHAT'S YOUR ROLE FOR TONIGHT,
GENERAL MANAGER?

29:28.663 --> 29:29.930
I'M IN FRONT OF HOUSE.

29:29.964 --> 29:31.399
UM, I'LL BE MEETING,
GREETING--

29:31.432 --> 29:32.651
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

29:32.651 --> 29:32.700
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

29:32.733 --> 29:33.868
WHEN THE CUSTOMERS SIT DOWN,

29:33.901 --> 29:35.136
WILL YOU NOT SORT OF BE
SO FALSE

29:35.169 --> 29:36.637
WHEN YOU JUMP ON--

29:36.671 --> 29:38.673
JUST SOMETIMES I FEEL IT'S
SO IN-YOUR-FACE.

29:38.706 --> 29:39.807
IT'S INTIMIDATING FOR THEM.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.941
OKAY.
YEAH?

29:40.975 --> 29:42.510
WATCHING YOUR PERFORMANCE,

29:42.543 --> 29:44.812
I WAS, LIKE, WHEW--
TACKY.

29:44.845 --> 29:46.314
WILL YOU PROMISE TO KEEP
YOUR PHONE OFF

29:46.347 --> 29:48.349
IN THE MIDDLE OF SERVICE?

29:50.117 --> 29:51.452
THAT'S DONE.

29:51.485 --> 29:52.820
WILL YOU PROMISE TO BE ATTENTIVE
TO STAFF NEEDS

29:52.853 --> 29:53.921
WHEN NECESSARY?
YEP.

29:53.954 --> 29:55.823

STEPPING INTO THIS BUSINESS?

29:58.959 --> 29:59.994
YEAH?

30:00.027 --> 30:01.862
I'LL ACT LIKE I ALWAYS DO,
YES.

30:01.896 --> 30:02.651
WILL YOU NOT TAKE IT
AS YOUR CAFE AND HANG-OUT AREA?

30:02.651 --> 30:05.366
WILL YOU NOT TAKE IT
AS YOUR CAFE AND HANG-OUT AREA?

30:05.399 --> 30:07.201
THAT IS A GREAT MORALE
BOOSTER

30:07.234 --> 30:10.204
BEFORE THE OPENING
OF THIS AMAZING NEW RESTAURANT.

30:10.237 --> 30:11.739
WILL YOU ACTUALLY TREAT IT
AS A BUSINESS?

30:11.772 --> 30:13.207
IF YOU COULD TRY TO MAKE

30:13.240 --> 30:15.042
SOME IMPROVEMENT THIS EVENING.

30:15.076 --> 30:17.311
PLEASE?
YEAH.

30:22.249 --> 30:23.517
OKAY.

30:23.551 --> 30:25.553
YOU'RE GIVING HIM
SUCH A HARD TIME

30:25.586 --> 30:27.088
AND IT'S MAKING ME ANGRY.

30:27.121 --> 30:29.156
I'M FRUSTRATED FOR THE LACK
OF RESPECT

30:29.190 --> 30:30.858
THIS MAN HAS.

30:30.891 --> 30:32.560
THAT'S WITH HIM,
NOT WITH YOU.

30:32.593 --> 30:32.651
SO WOULD YOU MIND
KEEPING YOUR NOSE

30:32.651 --> 30:33.427
SO WOULD YOU MIND
KEEPING YOUR NOSE

30:33.461 --> 30:35.296
OUT OF MY BUSINESS.

30:35.329 --> 30:36.897
DON'T TRY AND INTERRUPT ME.

30:36.931 --> 30:38.733
EXCUSE ME,
THIS IS A LOYAL WORKER THERE--

30:38.766 --> 30:40.000
OH, HERE WE GO.
NO, I'M SORRY.

30:40.034 --> 30:40.968
YOU DON'T NEED YOUR MINIONS

30:41.001 --> 30:42.603
TO TRY AND CONVINCE ME
HOW GOOD YOU ARE

30:42.636 --> 30:43.938
ON THE BACK
OF WHAT I'VE EXPERIENCED.

30:43.971 --> 30:44.939
IS THAT CLEAR?

30:44.972 --> 30:46.307
MARTIN, PLEASE--

30:46.340 --> 30:48.809
GORDON HELP US TO ACHIEVE
THAT ONE.

30:48.843 --> 30:50.177
AN AMAZING JOB.

30:53.314 --> 30:54.782
ABSOLUTELY, DEFINITELY.

30:57.084 --> 30:58.619
THANK YOU, MOHAMMAD.

30:58.652 --> 31:00.287
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT
FOR THE LAST WEEK.

31:00.321 --> 31:01.522
I'M REALLY PLEASED
THAT IT CAME OUT.

31:01.555 --> 31:02.651
SO NOW I WANT TO SEE
POSITIVITY FROM EVERYBODY.

31:02.651 --> 31:03.090
SO NOW I WANT TO SEE
POSITIVITY FROM EVERYBODY.

31:03.124 --> 31:04.792
ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY.

31:04.825 --> 31:06.727
AND IF THERE'S ANYONE
WHO DOESN'T THINK

31:06.761 --> 31:07.561
THEY CAN PULL ON THE ROPE
LIKE THAT,

31:07.595 --> 31:08.896
LOOK FOR A NEW JOB.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.508
IT'S THE MORNING OF RELAUNCH,

31:14.508 --> 31:15.342
AND GORDON HAS ORGANIZED
A PLAN

31:15.375 --> 31:18.388
TO SPREAD THE WORD IN MANHATTAN.

31:18.388 --> 31:20.328
IT'S A PURNIMA PARADE.

31:20.328 --> 31:21.329
LOOK AT THAT!

31:30.539 --> 31:31.573
OFF WE GO.

31:31.606 --> 31:33.642
AND WE JUMP ON, YES?

31:33.675 --> 31:34.876
IT'S AMAZING.

31:34.910 --> 31:37.879
THE GIRLS, MUSIC,

31:37.913 --> 31:39.714
AND THE PROMOTING IDEAS--
ALL OF THEM.

31:39.748 --> 31:40.736
I LOVE IT,
I LOVE YOU!

31:40.736 --> 31:41.349
I LOVE IT,
I LOVE YOU!

31:41.383 --> 31:42.884
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HAPPY NOW.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.789
PEOPLE WERE ASKING
WHERE THE RESTAURANT IS,

31:47.822 --> 31:51.159
AND IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE
TO DO SOMETHING TOGETHER.

31:51.192 --> 31:53.562
WE NEEDED THAT
MORE THAN ANYTHING

31:53.595 --> 31:55.697
BECAUSE I THINK ALL
OF OUR SPIRITS WERE SO BROKEN.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.869
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'VE ALL COME ALIVE!

32:00.902 --> 32:02.103
MY GOD!

32:04.339 --> 32:06.942
IT'S ONLY TWO HOURS TO GO
UNTIL THE DOORS OPEN.

32:06.975 --> 32:09.344
AND THE RESTAURANT
IS BOOKING UP.

32:09.377 --> 32:10.736
THE FUTURE OF PURNIMA
RESTS GREATLY

32:10.736 --> 32:11.746
THE FUTURE OF PURNIMA
RESTS GREATLY

32:11.780 --> 32:13.081
ON TONIGHT'S RE-OPENING.

32:13.114 --> 32:14.649
YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
ABSOLUTELY.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.051
FOR MOHAMMAD,

32:16.084 --> 32:17.786
TONIGHT IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.

32:17.819 --> 32:19.020
BUT HE NEEDS HIS STAFF

32:19.054 --> 32:21.389
TO RISE TO THE OCCASION.

32:21.423 --> 32:22.924
HELLO, GOOD EVENING!

32:22.958 --> 32:24.392
I WOULD SAY THIS TABLE
RIGHT HERE.

32:24.426 --> 32:25.994
I GOT A TABLE
RIGHT HERE FOR YOU.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.929
THIS IS VERY EXCITING TO SEE

32:27.963 --> 32:29.998
THIS RESTAURANT IS FULL AGAIN.

32:30.031 --> 32:33.134
THE KITCHEN IS UNDER
THE STRONG LEADERSHIP OF VIKAS.

32:33.168 --> 32:34.903
SO HE'S GONNA BRING THE FOOD.

32:34.936 --> 32:36.438
BUT GORDON WILL BE KEEPING
AN EYE

32:36.471 --> 32:38.073
ON THE GENERAL MANAGER,
MARTIN.

32:38.106 --> 32:40.175
APPETIZERS--
EVERYBODY TAKES THEM OUT.

32:40.208 --> 32:40.736
THE SUCCESS OF PURNIMA
DEPENDS ON THE TEAMWORK.

32:40.736 --> 32:43.278
THE SUCCESS OF PURNIMA
DEPENDS ON THE TEAMWORK.

32:43.311 --> 32:45.947
THAT'S THE CRUCIAL POINT
OF RUNNING PURNIMA.

32:45.981 --> 32:47.449
UH, MARTIN.

32:47.482 --> 32:48.950
YEAH?
GIMME THE PHONE.

32:51.586 --> 32:52.954
IS IT ON?
IT'S OFF, IT'S OFF.

32:52.988 --> 32:53.989
JUST OFF.

32:54.022 --> 32:55.557
IT'S OFF--OKAY.

32:55.590 --> 32:57.125
YES, SIR,
YOU READY FOR ORDER?

33:00.261 --> 33:01.830
ONE CHICKEN TIKKA TRIO.

33:01.863 --> 33:04.165
THIS IS THE NEW STAFF
OF PURNIMA.

33:04.199 --> 33:05.667
NEW DECOR, NEW MENU,

33:05.700 --> 33:07.969
CONTEMPORARY, FRESH--
AND HOW EXCITING.

33:08.003 --> 33:10.736
IT'S ALL FRESH, ALL NEW,
AND WONDERFUL.

33:10.736 --> 33:12.007
IT'S ALL FRESH, ALL NEW,
AND WONDERFUL.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.708
EVERYTHING'S JUST GOING
PERFECTLY WELL.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.978
BUT ,
MARTIN'S STILL HERE.

33:21.116 --> 33:22.517
EXCELLENT--NICE ATMOSPHERE
IN THE DINING ROOM.

33:22.550 --> 33:23.718
NICE ATMOSPHERE.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.553
HOW'S THE VEGETABLE
MEDLEY?
VERY GOOD.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.389
CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONDING WELL

33:27.422 --> 33:28.823
TO THE NEW MENU.

33:28.857 --> 33:30.091
AND THE FIRST WAVE OF ORDERS

33:30.125 --> 33:32.594
IS NOW HITTING THE KITCHEN.

33:32.627 --> 33:34.763
LET'S GO.

33:34.796 --> 33:37.298
I NEED ONE LAMB CHOP
MEDIUM RARE, PLEASE.

33:37.332 --> 33:39.467
PIPING HOT, PLEASE.

33:39.501 --> 33:40.736
TAKE THIS, TAKE THIS.

33:40.736 --> 33:43.071
TAKE THIS, TAKE THIS.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.706
WE GOTTA TURN SOME CUSTOMERS
TONIGHT.

33:44.739 --> 33:46.675
WE GOTTA TURN TABLES,
YEAH?

33:46.708 --> 33:48.710
IT'S GOOD.
IT'S REALLY GREAT.

33:48.743 --> 33:50.145
CAULIFLOWER'S GREAT.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.983
BUT AS THE ORDERS START
TO PILE IN,

33:55.016 --> 33:56.618
MARTIN'S LACK
OF MANAGERIAL SKILLS

33:56.651 --> 33:58.319
START TO SHOW.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.428
AND THE WAIT STAFF
BECOMES CONFUSED.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.430
CAN YOU GET
THE TWO BACK TABLES?

34:08.463 --> 34:09.864
SERVICE, PLEASE.

34:09.898 --> 34:10.736
CAN SOMEBODY TAKE THIS, PLEASE?

34:10.736 --> 34:11.766
CAN SOMEBODY TAKE THIS, PLEASE?

34:11.800 --> 34:13.935
WHICH IS CAUSING DISORDER
IN THE KITCHEN,

34:13.968 --> 34:15.203
AND EVERYTHING IS STARTING
TO BACK UP.

34:15.236 --> 34:16.971
MARTIN, KHAN,

34:17.005 --> 34:18.406
THE FOOD'S SITTING HERE,

34:18.440 --> 34:19.707
AND NO ONE'S MOVING
THEIR ASS, YES?

34:19.741 --> 34:21.209
IT'S GETTING COLD
AND COLD AND COLD.

34:23.144 --> 34:24.646
OH, MY GOD!

34:24.679 --> 34:25.647
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

34:25.680 --> 34:27.048
I NEED ANOTHER RICE, PLEASE.

34:27.082 --> 34:28.416

34:28.450 --> 34:29.951

34:32.320 --> 34:34.155
EVERYONE'S STANDING IN IT.

34:34.189 --> 34:35.523
DARLING, CAN YOU GET
OUT OF THE RICE, PLEASE?

34:37.992 --> 34:39.627
MARTIN, COULD YOU SWEEP
THE RICE THEN,

34:39.661 --> 34:40.736
RATHER THAN EVERYONE
STANDING IN IT?

34:40.736 --> 34:40.895
RATHER THAN EVERYONE
STANDING IN IT?

34:40.929 --> 34:42.063
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

34:42.097 --> 34:43.631
BE NICE TO DO SOMETHING,
YEAH?

34:43.665 --> 34:45.133
SO WE DON'T HAVE
TO SEND MORE FOOD TO THE RATS.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.001
THAT'S GREAT;
FINALLY FOUND A JOB.

34:47.035 --> 34:48.703
OH,.

34:48.736 --> 34:50.353
EVEN ON A NIGHT WITH
A TOP CHEF AT THE HELM,

34:50.353 --> 34:52.574
MARTIN'S MISMANAGEMENT
OF HIS WAITERS

34:52.574 --> 34:54.454
HAS CAUSED PROBLEMS
IN THE KITCHEN,

34:54.454 --> 34:56.456
AND THE CUSTOMERS
ARE PAYING THE PRICE.

35:00.394 --> 35:01.628
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!

35:01.661 --> 35:04.264
IT'S COLD.
THEY FORGOT OUR ORDER.

35:04.297 --> 35:07.278
I'M SURPRISED NONE OF THE FOOD
CAME OUT WARM.

35:07.278 --> 35:09.878
IT'S A NIGHTMARE!

35:09.878 --> 35:10.736
OKAY, WE'RE NOW JUST STARTING

35:10.736 --> 35:11.958
OKAY, WE'RE NOW JUST STARTING

35:11.958 --> 35:13.399
TO TURN THESE FIRST TABLES

35:13.399 --> 35:14.438
BUT PANIC SET IN.

35:14.438 --> 35:16.399
CUSTOMERS ARE COMPLAINING
ABOUT FOOD BEING COLD.

35:18.939 --> 35:21.079
AND THESE STAFF ARE NOT USED
TO BEING BUSY,

35:21.079 --> 35:22.398
ESPECIALLY LIKE THIS.

35:26.438 --> 35:28.078
FOUR LEMON RICE

35:28.078 --> 35:28.939
IT'S COLD, YEAH,
LET'S GO.

35:28.939 --> 35:29.998
IT'S COLD 'CAUSE IT'S
LYING AROUND.

35:29.998 --> 35:30.879
JUST TAKE THIS, PLEASE.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.979
SERVICE, PLEASE.

35:32.979 --> 35:35.398
I NEVER SERVED
AS MANY CUSTOMERS BEFORE.

35:35.398 --> 35:39.259
WHO'S RUNNING THE RESTAURANT?
MARTIN?

35:39.259 --> 35:40.736
GORDON, YEAH.
SOMEBODY ORDERED THIS, 33.

35:40.736 --> 35:41.340
GORDON, YEAH.
SOMEBODY ORDERED THIS, 33.

35:46.219 --> 35:48.120
LET'S GO,
AND THERE YOU GO.

35:48.120 --> 35:48.980
ROUND AND THE BIG TRAY.

35:48.980 --> 35:49.960
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT TABLE?

35:52.460 --> 35:53.940
VAKAS--

35:53.940 --> 35:55.760
"VAKAS?"
VIKAS.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.361
I DON'T THINK THAT MARTIN

35:57.361 --> 35:59.800
UNDERSTANDS WHAT
A GENERAL MANAGER

35:59.800 --> 36:01.141
REALLY SHOULD BE DOING.

36:01.141 --> 36:02.661
DON'T MAKE ANY PHONE CALLS
ALONG THE WAY.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.921
STRAIGHT TO THE TABLE.

36:07.761 --> 36:09.080
NO, IT'S ACTUALLY BURNING,
YES.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.180
IT'S ACTUALLY BURNING?

36:12.460 --> 36:13.461
CUSTOMERS ARE COMPLAINING

36:13.461 --> 36:15.443
ABOUT THE FOOD COLD,
MY MAN.

36:15.443 --> 36:17.363
WHEN YOU PUT THE MEAL OUT
JUST NOW--

36:17.363 --> 36:20.162
I BELIEVE GORDON'S TRYING
TO GET ME ANGRY, IRED,

36:20.162 --> 36:21.962
ANNOYED OR WHATEVER.

36:21.962 --> 36:25.123
AND I WASN'T TAKING
ANY PART WITH THAT.

36:25.123 --> 36:26.762
AH,.

36:26.762 --> 36:28.542
GORDON HAS SEEN ENOUGH

36:28.542 --> 36:30.843
OF MARTIN'S MANAGERIAL
INCOMPETENCE,

36:30.843 --> 36:32.842
AND BELIEVES HE MAY HAVE
FOUND A SOLUTION.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.303
BE HONEST WITH ME.

36:34.303 --> 36:35.824
CAN YOU MANAGE THIS PLACE?

36:37.185 --> 36:39.444
SO STOP BLENDING IN
AND STAND ON YOUR FEET.

36:39.444 --> 36:40.736
OKAY?

36:40.736 --> 36:40.845
OKAY?

36:42.104 --> 36:44.065
I WILL TRY MY BEST
TO CONVINCE CHEF RAMSAY

36:44.065 --> 36:45.544
THAT I CAN RUN THIS RESTAURANT.

36:50.404 --> 36:51.244
ONE MINUTE, ONE MINUTE.

36:51.244 --> 36:52.464
I JUST DID THAT--

36:52.464 --> 36:53.504
NO, NO, NO!

36:53.504 --> 36:54.344
I HAVE TO PUT--

36:54.344 --> 36:56.524
THAT'S OKAY,
THAT'S OKAY--RELAX.

36:56.524 --> 36:58.024
WITH KHAN TAKING THE REINS,

36:58.024 --> 37:01.425
FOOD IS FINALLY MAKING IT
OUT TO THE CUSTOMERS.

37:01.425 --> 37:02.545
GOOD MAN.
THANK YOU.

37:02.545 --> 37:03.204
EXCELLENT.

37:17.865 --> 37:19.105
WITH KHAN IN THE DINING ROOM

37:19.105 --> 37:20.684
AND VIKAS IN THE KITCHEN,

37:20.684 --> 37:23.185
THE RESTAURANT IS BEGINNING
TO RUN SMOOTHLY.

37:26.506 --> 37:28.186
AND THEY MAKE ME FEEL GOOD.

37:28.186 --> 37:31.627
ONE, TWO, THREE!

37:31.627 --> 37:34.287
TONIGHT I MADE OVER $100.

37:34.287 --> 37:35.906
I WAS SO HAPPY.

37:44.547 --> 37:47.908
THE GRAND OPENING OF PURNIMA
WAS BUMPY IN THE MIDDLE,

37:47.908 --> 37:49.587
BUT FINISHED ON A HIGH NOTE.

37:49.587 --> 37:50.887
MOHAMMAD, CAN I HAVE
A QUICK WORD WITH YOU PLEASE?

37:50.887 --> 37:54.408
HOWEVER, GORDON KNOWS
HIS WORK IS NOT DONE.

37:54.408 --> 37:56.688
THIS PLACE
CAN BE PHENOMENAL.

37:56.688 --> 37:58.368
THE LOCATION'S EXTRAORDINARY.

37:58.368 --> 38:01.108
THIS IS A NEW START.
EXACTLY.

38:01.108 --> 38:02.547
YOU HAVE TO TREAT IT
AS A NEW BEGINNING.

38:02.547 --> 38:03.208
OF COURSE.

38:03.208 --> 38:04.547
I MEAN, IN A PERFECT WORLD,

38:04.547 --> 38:06.688
I WOULD SACRIFICE
ONE OF YOUR MANAGERS

38:06.688 --> 38:09.387
TO EMPLOY VIKAS.

38:09.387 --> 38:10.736
YOU CANNOT CARRY DRIFTWOOD
IN YOUR BUSINESS.

38:10.736 --> 38:13.748
YOU CANNOT CARRY DRIFTWOOD
IN YOUR BUSINESS.

38:13.748 --> 38:17.307
OUT OF THE THREE MANAGERS...

38:17.307 --> 38:20.647
ONE HAS TO GO.

38:20.647 --> 38:23.048
BETWEEN YOU AND I,

38:23.048 --> 38:25.528
MARTIN HAS AN AMAZING WAY

38:25.528 --> 38:26.988
OF MANIPULATING YOU.

38:26.988 --> 38:29.608
AND HE'S NOT WORTH
HIS WEIGHT

38:29.608 --> 38:31.328
IN TERMS OF WHAT
HE BRINGS TO THE TABLE.

38:31.328 --> 38:33.928
HEARING GORDON RAMSAY
SAY THAT TO MOHAMMAD,

38:33.928 --> 38:36.047
THAT MAKES ME UPSET
AND ANGRY.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.188
THE FRUSTRATION
JUST BOILED OVER.

38:38.188 --> 38:40.488
TONIGHT, MOHAMMAD--
YES.

38:40.488 --> 38:40.736
I HAVE NEVER USED YOU,
I'VE RESPECTED YOU.

38:40.736 --> 38:42.028
I HAVE NEVER USED YOU,
I'VE RESPECTED YOU.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.448
I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE DONE.

38:43.448 --> 38:44.768
I'VE NEVER CHEATED YOU.

38:44.768 --> 38:46.648
WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:48.767 --> 38:49.928
COME HERE.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.928
YOU'RE RECOMMENDING--

38:51.928 --> 38:53.028
ENOUGH--I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

38:53.028 --> 38:54.448
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN INSULTING.

38:54.448 --> 38:57.327
YOU'VE ACCUSE ME OF--

38:57.327 --> 38:58.048
DID YOU HEAR WHAT
I JUST SAID TO HIM?

38:58.048 --> 38:59.128
MARTIN--

38:59.128 --> 39:01.387
LET HIM GO.
GO ON, GET IT OUT.

39:01.387 --> 39:03.228
GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.

39:05.308 --> 39:07.688
YOU'VE ACCUSED ME OF RIDING
ON THIS MAN'S SHOULDERS.

39:07.688 --> 39:08.768
WHY ARE YOU POINTING LIKE THAT?

39:08.768 --> 39:10.736
BECAUSE I'M ANGRY, OKAY?

39:10.736 --> 39:10.868
BECAUSE I'M ANGRY, OKAY?

39:10.868 --> 39:12.327
YOU WANT TO SEE PASSION,
I'M GIVING YOU PASSION.

39:12.327 --> 39:13.568
THIS PERSON I'VE RESPECTED,

39:13.568 --> 39:15.308
AND YOU'VE HAD THE AUDACITY
TO ACCUSE ME

39:15.308 --> 39:17.248
OF, LIKE,
TAKING HIS MONEY--

39:17.248 --> 39:18.088
RIDING OFF HIS BACK.

39:18.088 --> 39:19.328
RIDING OFF HIS BACK
IS WHAT YOU SAID.

39:19.328 --> 39:21.308
WELL, THAT IS DISGUSTING.
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT.

39:21.308 --> 39:22.408
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

39:22.408 --> 39:24.087
WHAT ABOUT--
WHAT ABOUT--

39:24.087 --> 39:26.368
I HAVE NOTHING
TO BE GUILTY OF.

39:26.368 --> 39:27.868
YOU WHAT?
NOTHING.

39:27.868 --> 39:28.648
YOU SAT IN IT.

39:28.648 --> 39:30.428
IT'S ROTTEN!

39:32.548 --> 39:33.928
YEAH, YOU RAN IT,
YOU SAT IN IT--

39:33.928 --> 39:34.768
YES.

39:34.768 --> 39:35.368
YOU WASTED IT.

39:35.368 --> 39:36.408
YES, I WASTED, YES.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.228
AND YOU ENCOURAGED IT.

39:38.228 --> 39:39.549
THIS WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

39:39.549 --> 39:40.736
IT SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL--

39:40.736 --> 39:41.869
IT SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL--

39:41.869 --> 39:43.869
AND I ASKED YOU
TO COME ON BOARD.

39:45.648 --> 39:47.188
I'M GLAD.
NOT GUILTY.

39:47.188 --> 39:49.048
MOHAMMAD, I--

39:49.048 --> 39:49.510
NOT GUILTY!

39:53.928 --> 39:55.128
I HAVE NOTHING
TO BE GUILTY OF.

39:55.128 --> 39:58.029
YOU WHAT?
NOTHING.

39:58.029 --> 39:58.928
YOU SAT IN IT.

39:58.928 --> 40:00.528
YEAH, YOU RAN IT,
YOU SAT IN IT--

40:00.528 --> 40:01.695
YOU WASTED IT.

40:01.729 --> 40:02.730
YES, I WASTED, YES.

40:02.763 --> 40:04.465
AND YOU ENCOURAGED IT.

40:04.498 --> 40:05.833
THIS WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

40:05.866 --> 40:09.804
IT SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL--

40:09.837 --> 40:11.672
AND I ASKED YOU
TO COME ON BOARD.

40:11.705 --> 40:12.706
I'M GLAD.
NOT GUILTY.

40:12.740 --> 40:13.559
MOHAMMAD, I--

40:13.559 --> 40:14.426
NOT GUILTY!

40:14.426 --> 40:15.728
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE
THIS PUT-DOWN ANYMORE.

40:15.761 --> 40:17.563
I HAVE NOTHING
TO BE GUILTY OF.

40:17.596 --> 40:19.231
LISTEN,
THIS IS MY LAST NIGHT.

40:19.264 --> 40:20.666
YOU SAID IT WAS
YOUR LAST NIGHT.

40:20.699 --> 40:21.456
YES.
I'M CONFUSED.

40:21.456 --> 40:21.834
YES.
I'M CONFUSED.

40:21.867 --> 40:23.068
YES, THIS IS MY LAST NIGHT.

40:23.102 --> 40:24.603
THIS IS MY LAST--TONIGHT!

40:24.637 --> 40:26.105
OKAY, PLEASE TELL THE OWNER.
NOT ME.

40:26.138 --> 40:28.140
THIS IS MY LAST NIGHT.

40:28.173 --> 40:29.808
I'M OUT OF HERE.
I QUIT.

40:33.479 --> 40:35.314
WHEN MARTIN LEFT,

40:35.347 --> 40:36.782
ACTUALLY I'M IN SHOCK.

40:36.815 --> 40:38.784
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT'S GONNA GO
THAT BAD.

40:38.817 --> 40:42.321
I THINK GORDON RAMSAY
IS FULL OF ,

40:42.354 --> 40:44.757
AND I'M EXTREMELY ANGRY,
EXTREMELY PISSED OFF.

40:44.790 --> 40:46.825
AND I NOW TURN MY BACK
AND WALK AWAY.

40:51.630 --> 40:53.265
WITH THE SUCCESS OF THE RELAUNCH

40:53.298 --> 40:55.167
AND THE CHANGE OF MANAGEMENT,

40:55.200 --> 40:57.036
PURNIMA HAS BEATEN THE ODDS

40:57.069 --> 40:59.772
AND IS NOW LOOKING
TO A BRIGHT FUTURE.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.640
IN THE FOLLOWING DAYS,

41:01.674 --> 41:04.476
PURNIMA'S CONTEMPORARY
INDIAN FOOD AND ATMOSPHERE

41:04.510 --> 41:06.178
CONTINUED TO GENERATE
GREAT BUZZ

41:06.211 --> 41:07.646
THROUGHOUT NEW YORK CITY.

41:16.722 --> 41:18.791
THE RESTAURANT'S REVENUE
INCREASED,

41:18.824 --> 41:21.393
AND NATURALLY,
SO DID THE SERVERS' TIPS.

41:21.427 --> 41:21.456
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

41:21.456 --> 41:23.028
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

41:23.062 --> 41:25.898
AND CHEF VIKAS ACCEPTED
AN OFFER FROM MOHAMMAD

41:25.931 --> 41:28.133
TO BE THE RESTAURANT'S
ONGOING CONSULTANT.

41:31.103 --> 41:32.771
THANKS A LOT.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

41:32.805 --> 41:34.139
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

41:36.041 --> 41:38.310
LET'S BE HONEST--
IT'S GONE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL.

41:38.343 --> 41:40.079
- YES?

41:40.112 --> 41:42.247
GREAT FOOD, GREAT DECOR,

41:42.281 --> 41:44.717
GREAT BUZZ,
HAPPY CUSTOMERS.

41:44.750 --> 41:46.085
I REALLY MEAN IT.
THANK YOU.

41:46.118 --> 41:47.086
BLOODY GOOD JOB.

41:47.119 --> 41:49.221
YES?
YEAH?

41:49.254 --> 41:51.423
I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE CHANGES

41:51.457 --> 41:53.058
GORDON HAS MADE HERE.

41:53.092 --> 41:56.495
HE HAS GIVEN THIS PLACE
AN OPPORTUNITY TO THRIVE

41:56.528 --> 41:58.197
AND BE A REAL RESTAURANT.

41:58.230 --> 42:00.499
FROM ALL OF US OVER HERE,

42:00.532 --> 42:02.167
I THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.

42:02.201 --> 42:03.469
LISTEN, YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

42:03.502 --> 42:04.536
YOU'VE GOT ALL THE TOOLS,

42:04.570 --> 42:05.871
NOW DO IT.

42:05.904 --> 42:07.573
YOU START WORKING HARD.

42:07.606 --> 42:09.108
GORDON DID WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE

42:09.141 --> 42:10.876
WITH THE RESTAURANT.

42:10.909 --> 42:12.311
KHAN.

42:12.344 --> 42:14.580
MY EXPERIENCE WITH CHEF GORDON
WAS WONDERFUL.

42:14.613 --> 42:16.415
I HAVE THE CONFIDENCE
THAT WE CAN RUN THIS BUSINESS

42:16.448 --> 42:18.350
AND WE CAN RUN THIS RESTAURANT
SUCCESSFULLY.

42:18.383 --> 42:19.718
OKAY.
YES, BIG HUG.

42:19.752 --> 42:20.719
OKAY.

42:21.754 --> 42:24.590
OKAY!
RIGHT!

42:24.623 --> 42:26.358
PULL HIM BACK,
PULL HIM BACK.

42:26.391 --> 42:27.359
EXCELLENT!

42:27.392 --> 42:28.627
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

42:28.660 --> 42:29.862
NEIGHBORS!
YES.

42:29.895 --> 42:30.963
NEXT TIME,
I'M COMING TO EAT.

42:30.996 --> 42:32.364
I'M NOT COMING TO WORK.

42:32.397 --> 42:33.799
YES, YOU'RE WELCOME.
OKAY?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

42:44.309 --> 42:45.644
EXCELLENT.
GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.

42:45.677 --> 42:46.712
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED.

42:46.745 --> 42:48.547
STAND STRONG.
THANK YOU.

42:48.580 --> 42:49.648
GOOD NIGHT.

42:49.681 --> 42:51.456
GOOD NIGHT.

42:51.456 --> 42:51.550
GOOD NIGHT.

42:51.583 --> 42:54.419
OH, WHAT A TRANSFORMATION.

42:54.453 --> 42:55.888
I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK

42:55.921 --> 42:57.422
WE COULD TURN THIS AROUND.
TO THIS EXTENT

42:57.456 --> 42:59.124
FROM WHAT I SAW
ON MY FIRST DAY HERE.

42:59.158 --> 43:00.526
MY GOD.

43:06.051 --> 43:07.551
NEXT TIME ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

43:07.551 --> 43:09.648
THE MIXING BOWLS BUSINESS IS DWINDLING

43:09.648 --> 43:10.850
AND RELATIONSHIPS ARE CRUMBLING.

43:10.850 --> 43:12.389
YOU CAN'T GET SO OVERWHELMED.

43:12.389 --> 43:13.449
I WASN'T TOLD!

43:13.449 --> 43:14.749
THE MANAGER IS DESPERATE.

43:14.749 --> 43:15.909
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

43:15.909 --> 43:17.389
THE OWNER HAS LOST HIS PASSION.

43:17.389 --> 43:20.349
YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN WHOSE
DIED AND PUT OUT OF HIS MISERY.

43:20.349 --> 43:21.456
AND HIS WIFE WANTS
HIM TO SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.

43:21.456 --> 43:22.629
AND HIS WIFE WANTS
HIM TO SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.

43:22.629 --> 43:24.589
I CAN'T SACRIFICE MYSELF,

43:24.589 --> 43:25.949
FOR THE MIXING BOWL ANYMORE.

43:25.949 --> 43:28.845
GORDON IS THE LAST CHANCE
FOR THIS DYING VENTURE.

43:28.845 --> 43:30.690
IT'S A RESTAURANT IN CRISIS.

43:30.690 --> 43:32.870
DO NOT TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!

43:32.870 --> 43:35.229
NEXT TIME ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.
