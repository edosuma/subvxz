[dramatic music]

00:04.205 --> 00:06.440
*

00:06.474 --> 00:10.211
[brooding rock music]

00:10.244 --> 00:12.713
- My name is Brian Demmick.
I'm 34.

00:12.746 --> 00:15.483
I am an armor maker
and I am an educator.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.052
I have a pretty broad
background.

00:18.086 --> 00:20.488
I think that'll help me
in this competition.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.057
- My name is Craig Barr.
I'm 50 years old,

00:23.091 --> 00:24.758
and I've literally forged
thousands

00:24.792 --> 00:26.560
and thousands of blades.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.696
I can do it in my sleep
with my eyes closed.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.565
My wife would say
that I'm different.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.734
- My name is Mark Nevling.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.536
I'm 55 years old.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.706
When I first met my wife,
her family was like,

00:38.739 --> 00:40.741
"He does what for a living?"

00:40.774 --> 00:45.279
And most people do until they
actually see my work in person.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.847
- My name is Paul Brown.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.317
Bladesmithing is an artistic
expression for me.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.484
I've got a different eye.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.353
I'm a little bit ADOS.

00:52.386 --> 00:55.689
That's Attention Deficit--
Ooh, Shiny.

00:55.723 --> 00:59.327
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.262
You're here to engage
in three rounds of

01:01.295 --> 01:03.564
edged weapon making competition
specifically designed

01:03.597 --> 01:05.733
to test every aspe
of your skills.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.768
At the end of each round,
you'll be presenting your work

01:07.801 --> 01:09.403
to our panel of expert judges.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.572
They're the ones
who decide whether or not

01:11.605 --> 01:13.541
you walk out of here
with 10 grand and the title.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.776
Let's meet them now.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.879
World-renowned knifemaker
Jason Knight,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.781
historic weapons
re-creation specialist

01:20.814 --> 01:23.617
and swordsmith David Baker,

01:23.651 --> 01:27.721
and Kali martial artist,
Doug Marcaida.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.624
Now, I'm sure that you guys
showed up here expecting that

01:30.658 --> 01:32.326
in the first round
of this competition

01:32.360 --> 01:35.729
you would make a signature blade
in your signature style.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.666
Well, at "Forged in Fire"
we like to change things up.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.268
In this first round
of competition,

01:40.301 --> 01:43.537
you will be making a karambit.

01:43.571 --> 01:48.542
- I have never made one of those
before in my life.

01:48.576 --> 01:52.646
- Karambit is a curved blade
that is made to be a weapon.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.749
- I've never, never seen
anything like this before.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.786
- It is most commonly held
this way--underhand.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.689
It's got a point so that
you can thrust with the blade.

02:01.722 --> 02:05.659
The inside curve is gonna be
sharpened so I can cut this way.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.396
And finally the outer curve
is also gonna be sharpened

02:08.429 --> 02:10.298
so you can lacerate this way.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.832
- Additionally,
each of your blades

02:11.865 --> 02:14.502
will have an integral
finger ring.

02:14.535 --> 02:17.205
It will have a double-edged
forward-facing curve.

02:17.238 --> 02:20.508
- Double-edge,
so four grinding edges.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.211
Extremely difficult.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.878
- Now, in the second
round of competition,

02:24.912 --> 02:26.347
you'll be putting handles
on your blades

02:26.380 --> 02:28.582
to turn them into
fully functional weapons

02:28.616 --> 02:30.784
that will then be tested
for strength and durability

02:30.818 --> 02:32.420
splitting through a dowel,

02:32.453 --> 02:36.690
and for edge retention
in a ham stab and slice.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.559
You will have 10 minutes
to work on your design.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.595
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.498
Oh, and one other thing.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.434
Because this is
"Forged in Fire,"

02:46.467 --> 02:48.436
we have a gift for you
underneath those cloths.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.570
Go ahead and lift that up.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.473
*

02:52.506 --> 02:54.975
That is a section
of coil spring.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.510
Once you get that uncoiled,

02:56.544 --> 02:57.811
it should make
a pretty strong knife.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.413
- Oh, jeez.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.782
Working with spring steel
can be difficult

03:01.815 --> 03:03.417
because heating it

03:03.451 --> 03:05.386
and bending it out
of that coil could be

03:05.419 --> 03:08.489
a very challenging experience.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.591
- Good luck, bladesmiths.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.561
Your 10-minute design
window starts now.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.729
*

03:15.763 --> 03:18.499
- You know where
this can go off the rails?

03:18.532 --> 03:19.600
The karambit,
when you look at it,

03:19.633 --> 03:21.635
it's a very simple design.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.905
Overdesigning these things
is what can really go wrong.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.940
- I'm just thinking about
how it's gonna be tested.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.410
I feel like
a more sharp angle

03:29.443 --> 03:31.712
on there would lend itself
to coming down

03:31.745 --> 03:33.447
and delivering
a nice, deep cut;

03:33.481 --> 03:36.484
also would really assist
in punching

03:36.517 --> 03:38.286
and stabbing through something.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.420
*

03:39.453 --> 03:41.789
- The design for my karambit

03:41.822 --> 03:44.558
was basically just me
going out there winging it

03:44.592 --> 03:46.494
because I never made one before.

03:46.527 --> 03:47.961
I don't consider myself
to be an artist.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.563
I'm more utilitarian,

03:49.597 --> 03:50.698
and that's where I shine,
you know?

03:50.731 --> 03:51.865
That's my strong point.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.502
*

03:54.535 --> 03:56.737
- When I draw a knife, it looks
like a three-year-old did it.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.872
My wife wanted me
to do it in crayon,

03:58.906 --> 04:00.941
'cause she thought it
would be pretty funny.

04:00.974 --> 04:05.513
My plan is to design it
in a semi-traditional shape,

04:05.546 --> 04:07.881
but big enough that
you can fit it in your hand.

04:07.915 --> 04:08.982
*

04:09.016 --> 04:09.983
- I love karambits.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.685
I've made several.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.587
I'm gonna try to make
a standard karambit,

04:13.621 --> 04:15.689
but I'm gonna throw
my little flair,

04:15.723 --> 04:17.491
my little style in
on top of it.

04:17.525 --> 04:18.592
It'll be different for sure.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.361
It won't be the norm.

04:20.394 --> 04:23.063
- Bladesmiths, your 10-minute
design window is closed.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.534
Your three-hour forge time
starts now.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.336
*

04:28.369 --> 04:29.570
And they're off.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.872
Paul is the only
one of our smiths

04:31.905 --> 04:35.409
who has actually made
a karambit before.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.711
- We had a challenge before
where we had to have them

04:37.745 --> 04:38.946
to put an integral ring
on a knife...

04:38.979 --> 04:40.681
- Exactly.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.049
- And none of them were
well-executed at all.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.884
- I don't know
what this thing is.

04:43.917 --> 04:44.985
I don't know how this thing's
gonna be used.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.754
I'm really nervous.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.990
My main goal is to get it shaped
as quick as I can.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.859
- Brian just going for
straight-up

04:51.892 --> 04:54.662
man-versus-steel technique.
- Yeah.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.064
- Mainly because I'm hammering
my blade to shape,

04:57.097 --> 04:59.533
it's just not moving
the metal fast enough.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.535
So as soon as somebody
jumps off the power hammer

05:01.569 --> 05:03.437
and I see an opening,
I just jump on the power hammer

05:03.471 --> 05:04.572
and I start drawing it out.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.340
- This is a workout.

05:06.374 --> 05:09.076
This is a hard game
right here to play,

05:09.109 --> 05:12.346
and if you're not ready
physically and mentally,

05:12.380 --> 05:13.547
you're going down.

05:13.581 --> 05:17.818
*

05:17.851 --> 05:19.520
- Forging the karambit
is difficult

05:19.553 --> 05:20.921
because
I've never done it before.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.690
[metallic clanging]
Oops.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.926
So my plan is to revert
to what I know works for me.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.528
I'm just winging it.
- Yeah.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.530
- [laughs]
- You know all that planning?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.399
All that careful drawing?
Out the window.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.666
- Right out the window.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.967
When you forge
your cutting edge,

05:34.001 --> 05:36.470
it's gonna bring the tip
of the blade up.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.871
So you don't want that
on this blade,

05:37.905 --> 05:39.607
so I'm basically gonna

05:39.640 --> 05:41.709
just do a rough forging
on the lower cutting edge

05:41.742 --> 05:43.944
and just make sure
I got a good, straight blade

05:43.977 --> 05:45.413
and I'm gonna go to the grinder.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.881
*

05:47.915 --> 05:49.883
- The hardest part
when you have that spring

05:49.917 --> 05:51.585
is to get it flattened out

05:51.619 --> 05:53.854
so that you can
actually make the knife.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.490
The concern I have more
with this competition

05:56.524 --> 05:59.493
is, I'm used to doing things
at a certain pace.

05:59.527 --> 06:03.431
And out there, that's way faster
than I build a knife.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.065
The whole blade's still
pretty darn thick.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.767
It's got a long way to go.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.969
- So, Mark, he's got
his steel drawn out

06:09.002 --> 06:10.871
to a very decent length.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.706
- He could get two karambits.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.676
- Even in combat, when you have,

06:15.709 --> 06:17.077
they don't function well.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.012
It's a close-quarter
combat weapon.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.482
It's supposed to be
very concealed.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.484
Even if the blank is here,
I can flick

06:23.517 --> 06:26.820
and I can capture and cut
and puncture with karambit.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.188
- Man, do that to me.
I like that.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.959
*

06:31.992 --> 06:33.727
- I've got a plan
kind of in mind

06:33.761 --> 06:35.929
because I've made the knife.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.031
We're in good shape.
This is gonna work.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.200
Trying to kind of get
my little hole in there

06:40.233 --> 06:42.436
before we, uh,
have to be real careful

06:42.470 --> 06:43.971
or else I'm gonna
make my metal too thin

06:44.004 --> 06:46.006
and put it in a bad spot.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.610
- The hole is the critical issue
on this knife.

06:49.643 --> 06:53.146
We don't want the hole to cut
our finger off when we use it.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.782
- The last time
I made a karambit,

06:54.815 --> 06:57.150
I probably took six hours
to make the blade.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.720
I've gotta go balls-to-the-wall
to get this thing going.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.523
*

07:02.556 --> 07:04.592
- One hour has elapsed.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.527
You have just two hours
remaining

07:06.560 --> 07:08.529
to finish your karambits.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.798
- It's getting warm.
[laughs]

07:10.831 --> 07:13.467
- After drifting the initial
hole on the power hammer,

07:13.501 --> 07:14.902
I bring it over to the anvil,

07:14.935 --> 07:16.937
but the height of my anvil
is rather high.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.474
So I grab a couple forge bricks

07:20.508 --> 07:21.609
and throw them down
in front of it

07:21.642 --> 07:22.776
and stand on them.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.878
[metallic clanging]
- Ooh.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.715
- I like it when the steel's
so hot it catches dirt on fire.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.016
[laughter]

07:29.049 --> 07:30.484
- The hammer was uncomfortable,

07:30.518 --> 07:31.919
the anvil was uncomfortable,

07:31.952 --> 07:34.154
the, you know, I was like, "Ah!"

07:34.187 --> 07:36.056
*

07:36.089 --> 07:37.825
- At this stage of the game,
I'd invested

07:37.858 --> 07:40.694
a lot of time
in hammering my blade to shape.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.963
I don't use a lot of these
tools in my own shop.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.132
Totally outside
of my comfort zone.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.234
I tended to do more hand
hammering.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.837
Come on, baby.
Come on.

07:49.870 --> 07:54.842
- So Brian's still working
on his karambit's shape.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.611
- I'm hammering my bevels in
and making sure

07:57.645 --> 08:00.080
that I'm not gonna have a lot
of work to do on the grinder,

08:00.113 --> 08:01.715
because that clock is ticking.

08:01.749 --> 08:05.919
*

08:05.953 --> 08:07.521
- The hardest part will be

08:07.555 --> 08:09.923
forging that big ring
in the back.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.525
I've never done that before.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.293
Gonna start punching
the hole now.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.295
Still pretty thick.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.997
I'm looking at the blade,

08:17.030 --> 08:18.799
and I'm going,
"I have too much metal here."

08:18.832 --> 08:21.268
So I'm thinning it out
and cutting it down.

08:21.301 --> 08:24.204
I'm having a lot of trouble
working on the grinder.

08:24.237 --> 08:27.140
Come on. [bleep].

08:27.174 --> 08:28.909
Trying to make sure
everything is straight

08:28.942 --> 08:30.611
is extremely difficult,

08:30.644 --> 08:33.614
especially with a curved blade
on both sides.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.016
Not too happy
with how I'm doing.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.051
My handle feels too long.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.988
It feels great like that,

08:41.021 --> 08:43.323
but it feels too long like this.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.759
- Watching Mark,
in this particular challenge

08:45.793 --> 08:47.628
for this kind of karambit,

08:47.661 --> 08:49.897
we are expecting to hold it
this way, a normal thing,

08:49.930 --> 08:52.065
which is a whole art form
in itself

08:52.099 --> 08:55.335
to be able to get a handle
that fits the hand.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.071
- Hopefully the guys
who are working with it

08:58.105 --> 08:59.907
have bigger hands
than mine.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.577
I tend to have kind small hands.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.613
- Finally got my bevels
on the knife.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.681
I've kind of got it going
in the direction I want it.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.583
I need to heat-treat this blade.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.318
- Paul's got a very hot tip
on that blade.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.786
- Oh, yes, he do.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.122
That looks like
about 2,000 degrees.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.191
And when you quench
above 1,500 degrees,

09:18.225 --> 09:21.695
the grain structure inside of
the steel will begin to enlarge.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.864
If the blade breaks,
it looks like sugar.

09:23.897 --> 09:30.938
- Got to go. Here we go.
- What is he doing?

09:30.971 --> 09:34.174
- I know that that's a weak
structure inside of his steel.

09:34.207 --> 09:37.010
I feel like he's in the most
trouble of all of them,

09:37.044 --> 09:39.613
and I don't think he even knows.

09:39.647 --> 09:40.914
- The heat-treat went
really well.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.750
Took a file to it.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.652
She skated across there
just like I wanted it to.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.153
*

09:46.186 --> 09:48.021
[metallic clanging]
- Oh, he dropped it.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.190
- Happened to knock my blade off
onto the floor,

09:50.223 --> 09:51.925
and it goes tip-first
into the concrete.

09:51.959 --> 09:52.960
[groans]

09:52.993 --> 09:57.130
Oh, [bleep].

09:57.164 --> 09:59.299
There's something inside of me

09:59.332 --> 10:01.068
that needs to pee
just a little bit.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.805
*

10:04.838 --> 10:06.373
It goes tip-first
into the concrete

10:06.406 --> 10:08.341
and chipped the concrete
and didn't hurt the blade.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.977
- Paul dropped his blade.
It didn't break.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.178
That's good.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.413
- So, I call that a win.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.918
- You have only one hour
remaining to finish your work.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.054
*

10:21.088 --> 10:22.723
- Uh-oh.

10:22.756 --> 10:23.757
I don't know
if I got the design right.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.859
I don't know.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.327
I think the biggest struggle
for me during the challenge

10:27.360 --> 10:29.262
is grinding
the lower cutting edge

10:29.296 --> 10:31.398
because it's curved.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.767
You can't lay it completely
flat on your platten.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.235
It just won't work.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.170
- Craig's blade
actually looks pretty good, man.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.172
- That's just it.
- It looks good.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.674
- It's really taking shape.
- He's got the ring on there.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.309
He's got it dropping
in on both sides

10:42.342 --> 10:44.277
and then swelling into a hand.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.314
- I know that my tang--
I believe it's too long.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.751
I'm not gonna address it
at this point because if I do,

10:50.784 --> 10:52.820
I'll end up with nothing
to present to the judges.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.154
I feel pretty good about it.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.689
It is what it is.
Just got to keep going.

10:55.723 --> 10:58.291
*

10:58.325 --> 11:01.228
- So, with a half an hour left,
I'm feeling under the knife.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.064
I just have to really try to get
that geometry as good as I can.

11:04.097 --> 11:07.267
I'm just trying to get
everything forged as close

11:07.300 --> 11:10.170
as I can
without making it too thin.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.240
- Oh, he's changing his shape.
- Adding more curves.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.274
- Wow.
- More of an angle.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.843
- [scoffs]

11:15.876 --> 11:17.444
- Dang, he's making
that a great.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.913
- More of a bend.
- It's like a big fish hook now.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.782
- Yeah, but he can stab
you around a corner.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.751
[laughter]

11:23.784 --> 11:26.887
*

11:26.920 --> 11:28.455
- Craig just quenched.
- Yep.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.157
*

11:30.190 --> 11:32.425
- I don't see anything good now

11:32.459 --> 11:34.294
that I'm thrilled with.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.864
I am not happy with
the length of the handle,

11:36.897 --> 11:40.801
the thickness of the metal
around the ring.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.103
- Mark's been at the grinder
for a while now

11:43.136 --> 11:44.838
and he still has
that large handle.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.874
- If the blade is good,
it'll perform,

11:46.907 --> 11:49.376
but it go back to the end user--
how comfortable it is.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.945
- The grinds are
completely uneven.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.114
It's embarrassing.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.083
Normally at this point
I would be throwing it away

11:56.116 --> 11:57.384
and starting over again.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.753
- Ten, nine,

11:59.787 --> 12:02.255
eight, seven, six,

12:02.289 --> 12:04.324
five, four,

12:04.357 --> 12:07.527
three, two, one.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.462
Shut down your machines!
Drop your tools!

12:09.496 --> 12:11.899
Your forging time is over.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.067
*

12:14.101 --> 12:17.004
- I just was so
out of my element

12:17.037 --> 12:19.973
never having even
made one of these before.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.109
I could be the first
eliminated very easily.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.045
- It went a lot better
than I hoped it would.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.847
It's looking pretty good.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.517
I got this.

12:30.550 --> 12:33.486
- Bladesmiths, over the course
of the last three hours,

12:33.520 --> 12:36.824
you had the opportunity
to forge karambits.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.793
Brian, please present
your work to the judges.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.362
*

12:42.395 --> 12:44.197
- Well, Brian,
what I like about your design

12:44.231 --> 12:46.299
is that it looks like
you're gonna be able to thrust

12:46.333 --> 12:48.035
neatly with a punch with that.

12:48.068 --> 12:51.171
It feels like it
definitely can hook and slash.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.106
- Thank you.
- The only problem is

12:53.140 --> 12:56.109
it's very awkward-feeling
in my hand.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.979
A couple of inches
is too much handle here.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.413
*

13:00.447 --> 13:02.015
- Craig, are you ready?

13:02.049 --> 13:04.217
- No.
[laughs]

13:04.251 --> 13:07.020
*

13:07.054 --> 13:09.156
- When you look at the karambit
from a distance,

13:09.189 --> 13:12.459
the scale looks very much
like a karambit.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.427
When you get up close,

13:14.461 --> 13:16.463
ay karambit,
that's a big karambit.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.966
- [laughs]
Yeah. I agree.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.367
- So much space in there.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.102
Can that be fixed?
Hopefully it can.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.171
Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.206
- Mark, you're up.

13:26.239 --> 13:29.542
*

13:29.576 --> 13:31.378
- If you have it normally
this way,

13:31.411 --> 13:33.947
that's a fine-feeling karambit
right there.

13:33.981 --> 13:37.017
The minute you add the ring,
it separates my finger

13:37.050 --> 13:39.586
and now it's so unwieldy
to hold onto.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.154
- It was kind of
difficult for me.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.422
I'd like to get in there
and file

13:42.455 --> 13:44.324
the inside of that ring
a little bit,

13:44.357 --> 13:45.258
but I didn't have time
to do that.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.359
- Yeah.

13:46.393 --> 13:47.961
*

13:47.995 --> 13:49.296
- Paul, you're up.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.564
*

13:51.598 --> 13:53.500
- I look at that,
and you nailed it.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.535
Size-wise, it's right there.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.971
The alignment is good.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.139
- It feels good.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.473
It looks good.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.110
But...

14:03.143 --> 14:05.078
I have two problems.

14:05.112 --> 14:08.315
One that I can see right here
is how thin your ring is.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.918
This becomes the weakest
part of the knife,

14:10.951 --> 14:12.886
and it should be
the focal point of it.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.888
My other concern is,

14:14.922 --> 14:17.524
I was watching you
heat-treat your blade.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.227
This blade was as hot
as the inside of that forge.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.895
I know what steel
like that looks like.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.430
It looks like sand
when you break it.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.631
It's weak.

14:24.664 --> 14:28.135
So that's my concern with this.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.470
- It's time for the judges
to make that decision

14:30.503 --> 14:32.405
that sends one of you
away from the Forge.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.074
I'll need you to leave
your blades here

14:34.107 --> 14:35.408
for closer inspection

14:35.442 --> 14:38.211
and then step off
the Forge floor.

14:38.245 --> 14:43.416
*

14:43.450 --> 14:44.952
- What'd you guys think of that?

14:44.985 --> 14:46.920
- Brutal.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.556
- Okay, is there a blade
on this table

14:49.589 --> 14:52.960
that you judges feel moves
forward no doubt about it?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.161
all: Yes.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.262
- Which blade is that?

14:55.295 --> 14:57.164
- Paul.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.232
- Paul has the closest
to what a karambit should be

14:59.266 --> 15:00.968
in terms of scale.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.036
Your blade begins
right after the pinkie.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.705
You've got the ricasso
and the blade shape right there.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.341
- All right. Is there another
blade out of these three?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.343
- Yes.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.145
- And that's Craig's blade
with the long handle.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.181
- That blade shape, I think,

15:14.214 --> 15:16.349
is probably the best
of all of them.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.351
Craig could just literally cut

15:18.385 --> 15:20.653
an inch out of the middle
of that handle.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.256
If it's done properly,
it's going to be just as strong.

15:23.290 --> 15:27.594
- So, now we come down
to our last two bladesmiths.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.329
Why don't we
start with Brian?

15:29.362 --> 15:30.964
- Is that me?
- Yeah, that's you, big guy.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.499
- Oh, boy.
- No, you got this.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.034
*

15:34.067 --> 15:36.436
- Flamingo of doom.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.138
- Between this alignment

15:38.171 --> 15:40.640
and this being
as thin as it is, it hurts.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.543
He could heat this up
and bend that forward,

15:43.576 --> 15:45.478
realign that,

15:45.512 --> 15:48.015
but this is just gonna get
thinner and thinner and thinner.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.650
- All right.
Let's move on to Mark.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.085
*

15:52.119 --> 15:53.553
- Just like Brian's,

15:53.586 --> 15:56.056
you can't align it
in your hand.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.491
The indexing hole
should be here.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.561
- I think that's my clunker.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.596
- When I put my finger here
and I move this,

16:03.630 --> 16:05.465
it's always cutting into me
because it's not big enough.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.167
Between these two,

16:07.200 --> 16:09.636
both are uncomfortable,
but this is worse.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.171
- Right here, right now,

16:11.204 --> 16:13.473
that would injure me;
that wouldn't.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.009
- You know, I love the shape
of the blade, though.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.477
- All right.
It's that time.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.778
Doug, have you made
your final decision?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.113
- Yes, I have.
- Dave?

16:20.147 --> 16:21.414
- Yep.
- Jason?

16:21.448 --> 16:22.515
- Yeah, man.
- All right.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.017
Let's go tell our smiths.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.652
*

16:25.685 --> 16:28.755
Bladesmiths, the judges
have made a final decision.

16:28.788 --> 16:32.592
It's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

16:32.625 --> 16:36.529
Mark, your blade did
not make the cut.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.332
- Mark, yours is not
the only one that had issues

16:39.366 --> 16:41.368
with the length of the handle,

16:41.401 --> 16:43.803
but your ring in comparison
to the other blades,

16:43.836 --> 16:46.373
if used right now,
may cause some injury,

16:46.406 --> 16:47.507
and for that we have to
let you go.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.077
*

16:50.110 --> 16:52.612
- Mark, please
surrender your blade.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.381
- The lessons I learned
in the Forge here

16:54.414 --> 16:56.549
I think is, periodically
I have to

16:56.583 --> 16:59.286
try something different
outside the box...

16:59.319 --> 17:00.787
Take care.

17:00.820 --> 17:04.091
Because the day
you stop learning

17:04.124 --> 17:06.126
is the day
they put you in the ground.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.495
*

17:08.528 --> 17:10.163
- Bladesmiths, congratulations.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.398
You've made it through
the first round

17:11.431 --> 17:12.765
and it's on to the second.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.534
You weapons have been tempered

17:14.567 --> 17:16.403
and now it's time
to put handles on them,

17:16.436 --> 17:18.271
turning them into
fully-functional weapons

17:18.305 --> 17:20.773
that'll be put to the test
splitting a dowel

17:20.807 --> 17:23.576
and in a ham
stab and slice.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.113
You will have three hours
in this round.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.581
Time runs out and your weapons
have been tested,

17:28.615 --> 17:30.683
one of you will have
to surrender your blades

17:30.717 --> 17:32.119
and leave the Forge.

17:32.152 --> 17:35.855
Good luck.
Your time starts now.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.158
- And we're off to the races.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.792
- I think, of everybody,

17:39.826 --> 17:43.096
Paul has the easiest job
in this round.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.532
But he has the most
questionable heat-treat.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.100
- Well, he's also got
the big question:

17:47.134 --> 17:48.735
getting those scales attached

17:48.768 --> 17:51.238
and comfortable
around that ring.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.639
- Right now, I'm just trying
to figure out a good way

17:52.672 --> 17:54.407
to put a handle on this
to make it work

17:54.441 --> 17:55.875
and reinforce my hole here

17:55.908 --> 17:57.744
so it's got a good thickness
on it.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.512
I'm gonna
guess it's some G-10.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.149
It's a fiberglass matte
and phenolic resin.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.683
I've already got holes
for my scales.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.585
I've got
the rough grinding done.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.753
I'm feeling good.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.588
This is gonna be a cakewalk.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.524
*

18:11.558 --> 18:12.759
- I'm really excited to
advance,

18:12.792 --> 18:14.294
but at the same time,

18:14.327 --> 18:15.662
I have a lot of big repairs

18:15.695 --> 18:17.430
that I have to make
to this weapon.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.499
The judges want me
to move that finger hole,

18:19.532 --> 18:20.567
so I need to move this knot.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.404
*

18:24.437 --> 18:26.139
- Man, that's ballsy.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.607
- Well, that changes things.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.843
- Brian's cut the ring off
of his handle.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.745
- I like that.
I'm down with that.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.282
- The ring is the foundation
of the karambit.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.217
If the ring isn't right,

18:37.250 --> 18:39.419
the knife isn't gonna cut,
and I'm going home.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.654
*

18:41.688 --> 18:44.491
I'm confident in my ability
to weld this thing back on

18:44.524 --> 18:46.426
and to create something
that's structural.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.596
- The ring works
with the handle,

18:49.629 --> 18:51.264
and if you don't have
the right distance

18:51.298 --> 18:52.732
between that and the blade,

18:52.765 --> 18:55.235
it's gonna be
very difficult to operate.

18:55.268 --> 18:58.838
- So my game plan initially was
to reset the angle on my handle.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.473
I feel really good about it.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.709
I think I addressed
those issues adequately.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.512
Soon, I'll have to go
and select my handle material

19:05.545 --> 19:06.846
and I really need
to come up with a plan

19:06.879 --> 19:08.915
for the handle really fast.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.385
My plan for round two

19:12.419 --> 19:15.422
is to correct the length
of my tang first,

19:15.455 --> 19:17.724
normalize the area
that I repaired

19:17.757 --> 19:20.460
so that I have a strong tang.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.295
- I think that Craig is
actually cutting his knife

19:22.329 --> 19:23.663
in half back there.
- You bet. Perfect.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.798
- Weld it.
- Cut an inch out of the middle.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.535
- Now I'm gonna weld
the blade back together

19:28.568 --> 19:30.970
and just my time with it
so I don't warp the tang.

19:31.003 --> 19:35.375
I use the torches to normalize
the area that I welded.

19:35.408 --> 19:38.645
It'll basically
harden that area.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.480
In the next hour, I want to

19:40.513 --> 19:42.849
at least have my scales
fitted up.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.818
I hope I have enough time
at the end to sharpen my blade.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.720
- One hour has elapsed.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.823
You have just two hours
remaining to finish your work.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.226
*

19:53.260 --> 19:54.927
- I'm starting to relax
'cause I realize

19:54.961 --> 19:57.230
the other two guys
are fighting it,

19:57.264 --> 19:59.332
and I don't have to.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.435
- He needs to reinforce
that integral finger ring.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.937
- Yeah.
With something sturdy.

20:04.971 --> 20:08.375
- The judges pointed out
that my tang was very thin,

20:08.408 --> 20:10.810
and that was kind of
part of my plan.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.346
I had planned
on putting scales over that.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.714
My knife is looking fine.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.383
I've got extra time,

20:16.416 --> 20:17.784
and I'm starting to look
at the other guys.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.353
I'm more concerned
about them than I am me.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.689
Nobody wants to just beat
somebody without a fight.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.825
*

20:25.858 --> 20:27.360
- Well, you'll all
be happy to know that

20:27.394 --> 20:29.329
Brian has finally shut down
his grinder,

20:29.362 --> 20:31.464
and it looks like he's gonna
go into his handle material.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.765
- So I choose this material

20:32.799 --> 20:34.000
because
it's kind of rustic-looking

20:34.033 --> 20:35.668
and it's a size that I need.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.003
I don't know
what my handle material is,

20:37.036 --> 20:38.971
but it smells pretty bad.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.542
The grinder is different than
the one that I have at home.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.411
Where do I grind these edges?

20:44.444 --> 20:46.979
Working with a different machine
in a different way

20:47.013 --> 20:49.015
than I'm generally
used to working

20:49.048 --> 20:50.950
is a real challenge for me.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.853
Ugh. [bleep].

20:53.886 --> 20:55.988
I lay in a grind
at an awkward angle,

20:56.022 --> 20:57.924
and I mess up my edges.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.025
- I think he's in trouble.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.461
- He's grinding it convex

21:01.494 --> 21:03.930
into that blade
while trying to grind it flat.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.799
- This is a big problem.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.035
If I have to start
this thing from scratch,

21:09.068 --> 21:10.837
I am n gonna enough time.

21:10.870 --> 21:15.342
20 minutes left.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.043
- Oh, [bleep].

21:17.076 --> 21:18.845
- What do you think
about Brian's current status?

21:18.878 --> 21:19.779
- I think he's in trouble.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.814
*

21:21.848 --> 21:24.417
- The clock is just ticking
way faster than I would like.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.453
I have so many things
that I have to go through.

21:26.486 --> 21:27.920
I have to fix that edge,

21:27.954 --> 21:29.489
grind the handle,

21:29.522 --> 21:31.658
and I have to get
this blade sharpened.

21:31.691 --> 21:36.463
If those things don't happen,
my blade won't advance.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.097
- The type of handle that
I'm gonna make

21:38.130 --> 21:39.999
I would refer to as a swell.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.969
It's just gonna be narrower
in the front and tapered.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.937
I make a mistake, I'm done.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.640
Time is running out,
and to make it to round three,

21:47.674 --> 21:48.941
I need to ensure
that my blade

21:48.975 --> 21:51.544
is a strong blade
and a sharp blade.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.913
My blade's still
a long ways from perfect.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.782
I'm sharpening my blade,
and I realize

21:55.815 --> 21:57.650
that I got to strop this thing.

21:57.684 --> 21:58.918
Then I remembered
I had a leather belt on,

21:58.951 --> 22:00.953
and I'm like, "Go for it

22:00.987 --> 22:02.855
'cause my pants
ain't gonna fall off."

22:02.889 --> 22:05.658
I'm flipping out.
[laughs]

22:05.692 --> 22:07.894
- Oh, no.
He done took his belt off.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.496
- There's nice leather strops

22:09.529 --> 22:10.730
sitting
on the table right there.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.665
- Not as nice as that belt.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.767
- After sharpening it,
I realized

22:14.801 --> 22:17.670
that there was still
way too much meat on my blade,

22:17.704 --> 22:19.939
and it just is gonna
be mediocre sharp.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.542
That's weighing on me
a little bit.

22:22.575 --> 22:25.712
Boy, I sacrificed a lot of
finish work to put [inaudible]

22:25.745 --> 22:27.814
[laughs]
It's pretty rough.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.582
*

22:29.616 --> 22:31.584
- Ten, nine,

22:31.618 --> 22:34.020
eight, seven, six,

22:34.053 --> 22:36.155
five, four,

22:36.188 --> 22:39.826
three, two, one.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.561
Shut down your machines
and drop your tools.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.130
- Time is up.
I've done my best.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.966
Now it's up to the judges
to give it their best shot.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.100
Let's see what happens.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.836
I didn't get it very sharp, so.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.471
- Me either.
- I finally get a chance

22:51.504 --> 22:52.939
to look
at my competitors' blades.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.907
I feel mine might be
a little flashier,

22:54.941 --> 22:56.909
but that was what
I was going for.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.511
We'll see about the heat treat.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.946
[laughs]

22:59.979 --> 23:03.850
*

23:03.883 --> 23:07.754
- Bladesmiths, this is the
strength and durability test.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.522
I'll be taking
your karambits

23:09.556 --> 23:10.923
and batoning them

23:10.957 --> 23:14.461
into these
hardwood dowels twice.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.796
If there's any cracks,
there's any issues

23:16.829 --> 23:19.198
with your blade,
it'll come apart.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.567
Brian, are you ready?

23:20.600 --> 23:21.568
- Ready.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.736
*

23:23.770 --> 23:26.072
If I'm gonna have
any chance at all,

23:26.105 --> 23:29.075
I just hope that my blade
is able is survive the test.

23:29.108 --> 23:37.617
*

23:37.650 --> 23:41.053
- Well, Brian, after two whacks,
there's no damage.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.689
There's no bending.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.024
It looks the same
as it did before.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.926
You pass that test.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.194
Craig, are you ready?

23:48.227 --> 23:49.562
- Yes, absolutely.
- Better be.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.597
- [laughs]
All right.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.131
*

23:52.164 --> 23:55.602
Watching Jason
hammer Brian's blade

23:55.635 --> 23:57.203
was a little more violent
than I thought it was gonna be,

23:57.236 --> 23:59.906
so now I'm starting to get
a little bit anxious.

23:59.939 --> 24:09.749
*

24:09.782 --> 24:12.018
- Well, Craig, no damage.

24:12.051 --> 24:15.822
It's good to see that you
shortened up your handle here.

24:15.855 --> 24:19.125
Sometimes when we give advice,
people don't take it.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.660
But I don't see any issues.

24:20.693 --> 24:21.961
Well done.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.030
- Thank you.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.932
- Paul, are you ready?
- Tear it up.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.700
*

24:27.734 --> 24:29.636
This is a make-or-break moment,
literally.

24:29.669 --> 24:30.970
If it breaks, I'm broke.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.238
[laughs]
I go home.

24:32.271 --> 24:39.211
*

24:46.619 --> 24:50.923
- Paul, my concern
was your heat-treat,

24:50.957 --> 24:53.125
but it held up.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.260
Well done.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.563
- Thank you.

24:56.596 --> 24:59.131
- Bladesmiths,
this is a sharpness test.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.900
To see how sharp
your karambits are,

25:00.933 --> 25:02.201
I will take your weapon

25:02.234 --> 25:03.736
and I will delivery
multiple stabs

25:03.770 --> 25:05.938
and slashes
on this side of ham.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.740
Brian, you're up first.
You ready?

25:07.774 --> 25:09.709
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

25:09.742 --> 25:12.979
- The thing that gives me
the most concern about my blade

25:13.012 --> 25:15.081
is, if he slashes
from the front,

25:15.114 --> 25:18.117
that blade might bite in, hook,

25:18.150 --> 25:20.252
and just drive it further
into the meat

25:20.286 --> 25:23.155
rather than creating
a smooth cut through there.

25:23.189 --> 25:30.129
*

25:37.369 --> 25:38.705
- Well, Brian,

25:38.738 --> 25:40.773
your karambit here is sharp.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.875
It lacerated deeply.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.678
Your thrusting with
the alignment of my hand,

25:45.712 --> 25:47.614
it penetrated all the way.

25:47.647 --> 25:51.751
But the handle is a little bit
on the skinny side.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.653
The finger ring's a little bit
on the bigger side,

25:53.686 --> 25:55.121
so even putting my finger
in there

25:55.154 --> 25:57.156
there's so much space
to move around,

25:57.189 --> 25:59.358
but overall, it will cut.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.127
- All right, thanks.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.261
- Craig, you're up next.
You ready?

26:02.294 --> 26:05.197
- Yes, I am.
- Let's do this.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.667
- I'm still not pleased
with the sharpness of my blade,

26:07.700 --> 26:09.902
so if I'm gonna fail anywhere,
it'll be right now.

26:09.936 --> 26:16.876
*

26:21.714 --> 26:23.282
- Okay, Craig.

26:23.315 --> 26:25.718
Your handle's
a little on the thick side,

26:25.752 --> 26:29.021
but your blade is razor sharp.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.958
The tip is pointy enough
to puncture deep within.

26:31.991 --> 26:35.361
Overall, your blade will cut.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.863
- Thank you, sir.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.097
- Paul, you're next.
You ready?

26:38.130 --> 26:39.666
- Let's do this.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.769
- Do this.
- Both these guys are in.

26:42.802 --> 26:46.939
This is my time.
I either shine or I go home.

26:46.973 --> 26:53.913
*

27:01.788 --> 27:03.189
- Well, Paul,

27:03.222 --> 27:05.424
it feels like
a Goldilocks moment here.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.259
One handle's too small.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.728
One handle's too big.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.830
One fits just right.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.932
And as you can see,
the damage that you can do

27:12.965 --> 27:14.667
with a blade that fits.

27:14.701 --> 27:17.770
Your blade is sharp
to lacerate and puncture.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.840
Overall, your blade will cut.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.709
- Thank you.
- Good job.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.276
- I was trying not to do

27:24.310 --> 27:25.845
a little happy dance
in front of everybody.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.780
[humming]

27:27.814 --> 27:29.181
- Bladesmiths,

27:29.215 --> 27:31.083
the judges have scoured over

27:31.117 --> 27:32.384
the performance of your blades,

27:32.418 --> 27:34.386
and they've made
a final decision.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.756
It's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

27:36.789 --> 27:43.462
*

27:43.495 --> 27:44.731
- Bladesmiths,

27:44.764 --> 27:46.165
the judges have scoured over

27:46.198 --> 27:47.834
the performance of your blades,

27:47.867 --> 27:50.903
and they've made
a final decision.

27:50.937 --> 27:53.005
Brian, your blade did
not make the cut.

27:53.039 --> 27:54.841
*

27:54.874 --> 27:57.176
- Brian, making a karambit
in a six-hour challenge

27:57.209 --> 27:58.845
is no small feat

27:58.878 --> 28:01.047
and you brought us
a functioning karambit.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.716
But in the end,
the placement of the ring

28:03.750 --> 28:05.718
and the angle of the blade

28:05.752 --> 28:07.854
just added up to make the
least comfortable of the three.

28:07.887 --> 28:11.123
And that's why we've got
to let you go.

28:11.157 --> 28:13.860
- Brian, please
surrender your weapon.

28:13.893 --> 28:14.927
- Nobody wants to lose.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.462
You want to advance.

28:16.495 --> 28:19.131
But I think I came here
to prove to myself

28:19.165 --> 28:21.968
that I could compete with
other people in blademaking.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.302
- Take care, man.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.937
- I accomplished my goal.

28:24.971 --> 28:27.306
I was able to show
that I can make a knife

28:27.339 --> 28:29.308
that's beautiful, that's strong,

28:29.341 --> 28:32.278
and that can hold up to some
really brutal punishment.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.113
*

28:34.146 --> 28:36.215
- Craig, Paul,
congratulations.

28:36.248 --> 28:37.884
You've managed to make it
into the third round

28:37.917 --> 28:39.418
of this competition,

28:39.451 --> 28:41.153
and you are one step
closer to the title

28:41.187 --> 28:42.789
of "Forged in Fire" Champion

28:42.822 --> 28:45.024
and a check for 10 grand.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.026
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

28:47.059 --> 28:49.528
where you will re-create
an iconic weapon from history.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.899
That weapon is...

28:52.932 --> 28:53.966
the makraka.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.469
*

28:57.503 --> 29:00.072
The makraka is
a sickle-shaped weapon

29:00.106 --> 29:02.541
with its cutting edge on
the inside curve of the blade.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.044
It was notably used
by the Azande tribe,

29:05.077 --> 29:06.913
a dangerous clan
that invaded and conquered

29:06.946 --> 29:09.882
Central Africa
in the early 1800s.

29:09.916 --> 29:12.518
With the help of the makraka,
they took no prisoners

29:12.551 --> 29:14.821
while defending their land
and resources.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.924
The sword was often used
in executions to remove limbs

29:17.957 --> 29:20.292
and decapitate intruders
or enemies.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.261
The Azandes' fatal
and terrorizing

29:22.294 --> 29:24.563
use of the makraka
is highlighted in the game

29:24.596 --> 29:26.098
"The Deadliest Warrior."

29:26.132 --> 29:29.268
*

29:29.301 --> 29:33.072
The length of the blade must be
between 18 and 20 inches,

29:33.105 --> 29:36.008
and you must also have
a 4-inch deep

29:36.042 --> 29:38.344
curve in your blade.

29:38.377 --> 29:39.946
You will have five days
at your home forge

29:39.979 --> 29:41.981
to accomplish this task.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.416
After those five days, you will
return and present your weapons

29:44.450 --> 29:46.953
to our panel of expert judges.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.021
Good luck, bladesmiths.
We'll see you in five days.

29:49.055 --> 29:50.389
*

29:50.422 --> 29:52.091
- Good luck to you, man.
- We got this.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.227
*

29:55.261 --> 29:57.296
Y'all ready for this?

29:57.329 --> 29:59.331
Gonna try to see
if I can knock out a makraka.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.601
Gosh.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.037
It's gonna be interesting
when I get done with it.

30:05.071 --> 30:08.407
I'm gonna try to make sure
this thing is stout and thick.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.443
Now I need to
put a curve in it.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.113
If you simply use gravity
and slap it a few times,

30:14.146 --> 30:15.214
there's no hammer marks on it.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.349
It all bends around easy.

30:17.383 --> 30:20.186
Yeah, baby!
[laughs]

30:20.219 --> 30:22.221
The biggest problem
with this weapon

30:22.254 --> 30:24.223
is, it's got
a 4-inch curve in it.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.292
It doesn't fit
in my heat-treat oven,

30:26.325 --> 30:28.327
and it doesn't fit
in my quench tank.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.930
I may have to rethink
how I heat-treat now.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.564
I think I'll just push
the cookies out of the way

30:32.598 --> 30:34.033
in the wife's oven and then
probably stick it in there.

30:34.066 --> 30:35.301
[laughs]

30:35.334 --> 30:38.504
*

30:38.537 --> 30:41.507
- Day one here at my home forge,
and I'm ready to get started.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.476
We're gonna be
building the...makraka?

30:44.510 --> 30:46.345
Am I saying it right?
[laughs]

30:46.378 --> 30:48.047
One of the things
I'm most concerned about

30:48.080 --> 30:49.882
is being able to present
to the judges

30:49.916 --> 30:51.884
something that's worthy
of using it

30:51.918 --> 30:53.519
and testing it,
but I don't know.

30:53.552 --> 30:56.388
It's a strange looking weapon.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.624
First, I'm gonna go
for a Damascus blade.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.960
We've got about 15 layers,
I believe.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.294
So, I'm gonna throw that
in the forge

31:02.328 --> 31:03.996
and bring it up
to a welding temperature.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.564
What I'm hoping to see
when I press this billet

31:05.597 --> 31:07.299
is that it takes
the weld immediately.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.235
I mean, I don't want
to see any cold spots.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.470
I can still see my joints.

31:11.503 --> 31:14.340
I don't like that.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.641
Before I go too far,
I'll grind it down

31:15.674 --> 31:16.608
and see what it looks like.

31:16.642 --> 31:20.146
*

31:20.179 --> 31:22.614
If this doesn't go the way
I planned it, it's garbage.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.484
I'll have to throw it away
and start over.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.553
- Day two.
Biggest challenges for today

31:27.586 --> 31:29.155
is coming up
with a quench tank.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.656
This one's not gonna work.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.291
This would be fine
for a big, long sword.

31:32.324 --> 31:33.960
It's a big, round sword.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.028
So, I've had to build
a new quench tank.

31:36.062 --> 31:39.031
Perfect. Oh, yeah.
I'm in good shape.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.266
So, I'm going
into the heat-treat.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.468
It's so long.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.337
With my forge, you can't heat
the whole blade at one time.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.039
You have to kind of drift it
in and drift it out,

31:47.073 --> 31:48.407
and it's kind of a chore.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.009
But it's all I have.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.244
*

31:52.278 --> 31:54.280
Here we go.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.514
That's not hard.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.349
Son of a bitch.

31:57.383 --> 31:58.951
If you don't have a hard blade,

31:58.985 --> 32:00.219
all you've got
is a real pretty piece

32:00.252 --> 32:01.487
of steel
that looks like a knife.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.156
Heat-treating makraka: take two.

32:04.190 --> 32:07.159
*

32:07.193 --> 32:08.660
That drags pretty hard.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.129
It's not hard again.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.297
Take three.

32:11.330 --> 32:14.400
*

32:14.433 --> 32:17.236
God.

32:17.269 --> 32:20.973
Failed not once,
not twice, three times.

32:21.007 --> 32:23.642
Perhaps it's not the steel.
Perhaps it's my oil.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.477
So, a quick phone call tells me

32:25.511 --> 32:27.413
there's quench oil
in Springfield.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.115
Road trip.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.349
It's an incredible
waste of time,

32:30.382 --> 32:31.717
but I've got no choice.

32:31.750 --> 32:35.087
*

32:35.121 --> 32:37.389
- Seems like I got my welds
real good on my billet,

32:37.423 --> 32:39.591
so I'm gonna try
forging this blade.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.428
My plan for today
is to finish my forging.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.330
I really want to make sure

32:44.363 --> 32:46.565
I don't draw
this blade out too long,

32:46.598 --> 32:48.367
otherwise my arc
will be too high.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.469
I don't want it to be
too much of a curve.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.371
Probably as straight
as I'm gonna get it.

32:52.404 --> 32:55.107
It's pretty vital to me
to get this heat-treat going

32:55.141 --> 32:57.376
and see just how
this blade's gonna react.

32:57.409 --> 33:00.112
All right, here we go.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.580
I'm looking
at my heat-treating oven.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.482
I know the blade
isn't gonna fit in there.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.017
It's wide enough,
but it's not long enough.

33:05.051 --> 33:06.485
I'm gonna try the torch.

33:06.518 --> 33:07.686
Oh, I don't think
I'm gonna be successful.

33:07.719 --> 33:08.787
I got to try something.

33:08.820 --> 33:13.225
*

33:13.259 --> 33:15.661
This might be all right.
I don't know.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.029
It looks good.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.097
I'm gonna test it.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.166
*

33:20.199 --> 33:23.335
[metallic clang]

33:23.369 --> 33:26.072
- I need to test this blade.
You ready?

33:26.105 --> 33:28.440
If this blade fails,
I'm back to square one.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.142
[metallic clang]

33:30.176 --> 33:31.377
[bleep].

33:31.410 --> 33:33.545
The blade broke.

33:33.579 --> 33:36.315
Literally, there's no time
to think about the solution.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.284
I'm just gonna grab
that piece of leaf spring...

33:38.317 --> 33:39.418
All right.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.786
And start forging a blade.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.654
Doesn't that get you?

33:42.688 --> 33:45.091
Some guy in a poor third-world
country can make stuff

33:45.124 --> 33:47.526
like this that will
withstand battle,

33:47.559 --> 33:49.295
and I got $70,000
worth of equipment,

33:49.328 --> 33:50.829
and I can't do it.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.631
- Day four.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.800
I had to drive all day
to go get some more oil.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.602
I got to get
this heat treat right.

33:56.635 --> 34:00.072
Moment of truth here.

34:00.106 --> 34:01.473
I sure hope it's hard.

34:01.507 --> 34:05.577
That's the sound
I've been looking for.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.679
My first oil was contaminated.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.416
The new oil, it worked
just like it was supposed to.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.784
Thank you.
[laughs]

34:12.818 --> 34:15.187
I've lost way too much time
because of heat-treating.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.256
Fit and finish is my forte.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.491
I don't have the chance
to do that now.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.260
I am a little bit of panic mode

34:21.293 --> 34:23.329
because my time
has dwindled away.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.763
I'm gonna have to
beef this thing up.

34:24.796 --> 34:26.598
It has to be
an effective weapon.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.534
*

34:28.567 --> 34:31.270
- I had to completely
forge another blade.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.805
Now it's day five,
and I got 20 hours left.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.607
That'll work.
I'm ready to heat-treat.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.309
The reason this blade failed is

34:37.343 --> 34:39.245
because of what
I have to heat-treat with.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.147
I know the blade
isn't gonna fit in there.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.382
The plan is to leave
a small slit at the bottom

34:43.415 --> 34:44.750
that the blade will
slide in and out of.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.453
Let's give this a shot.

34:47.486 --> 34:48.554
It looks nice.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.489
*

34:50.522 --> 34:51.790
If I don't get this blade

34:51.823 --> 34:53.592
heat-treated correctly,
I'm done.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.428
*

34:56.462 --> 34:58.497
Definitely hardened.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.599
Oh, what a relief.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.568
I've got a blade I believe
I can take to the final round.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.504
So now I've got to do a little
fitting on my handle material.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.473
But I don't know if I
have enough time to finish.

35:07.506 --> 35:13.479
*

35:13.512 --> 35:15.647
- Welcome back.
You've had five days

35:15.681 --> 35:18.217
at your home forge
to work on your makrakas.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.251
Craig, how'd it go?

35:19.285 --> 35:20.586
- Pretty good.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.222
I forged my blade
from a leaf spring.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.524
It has a hidden tang design
with a hickory handle.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.359
- That's fantastic.

35:27.393 --> 35:28.594
What about you, Paul?

35:28.627 --> 35:29.895
- I basically did
the same thing.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.763
I went with
the leaf spring steel.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.632
I ended up putting
a fuller in mine to help out

35:33.665 --> 35:35.434
just a little bit
in the strength part of it,

35:35.467 --> 35:37.669
but it was a good build.
I liked it.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.405
- All right, gents.
Up first:

35:39.438 --> 35:40.406
The kill test.
Doug?

35:40.439 --> 35:42.574
*

35:42.608 --> 35:44.410
- Bladesmiths,
makraka is a weapon

35:44.443 --> 35:45.611
used by the Zande warriors.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.379
It has a sickle-like blade

35:47.413 --> 35:49.281
and a tip representative
of the warrior's manhood.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.250
*

35:51.283 --> 35:54.286
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon can do,

35:54.320 --> 35:55.887
I will take your makraka

35:55.921 --> 35:57.923
and I'll delivery a lethal blow
on this ballistic dummy.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.325
Craig, you're up first.
You ready?

35:59.358 --> 36:00.659
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

36:00.692 --> 36:01.927
- All right.

36:01.960 --> 36:08.867
*

36:16.442 --> 36:17.709
- That's nasty.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.778
You can mess somebody up
with that thing.

36:19.811 --> 36:23.982
- This is one of the lightest
swords I've ever picked up.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.751
Your tip over here was so sharp

36:25.784 --> 36:28.787
that it went through
and broke some bones.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.990
Your edge of the inside curve
allowed me to lacerate

36:32.023 --> 36:35.394
deep into his bowels right here.

36:35.427 --> 36:38.764
But the most important thing,
it will kill.

36:38.797 --> 36:41.267
- Thank you.
- Paul, it's your turn.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.768
- I'm ready.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.836
I feel pretty good
about my blade.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.773
I know Craig, though,
that guy has got some skills.

36:47.806 --> 36:50.542
This is going to be
a close competition.

36:50.576 --> 36:57.516
*

37:06.858 --> 37:09.961
- Well, Paul, where one was
speed, this is power,

37:09.995 --> 37:11.830
because it's a lot heavier.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.933
It dug in deep
into the chest cavity.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.935
On the lacerations
from the blow,

37:16.968 --> 37:20.038
it tends to cut in
and pull out heavily.

37:20.071 --> 37:24.543
Almost lacerating total front
part of this ballistics dummy.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.879
Overall, your makraka will kill.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.348
- Thank you.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.716
- Up next, the strength test.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.918
Dave?

37:32.951 --> 37:34.953
- Gentlemen,
an advantage of that sword

37:34.986 --> 37:36.955
was to actually
reach around the shield,

37:36.988 --> 37:38.757
hitting the man behind it.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.493
So, to test the strength
and durability of your blades,

37:41.527 --> 37:43.362
I'm going to strike
these shields four times

37:43.395 --> 37:44.930
with each of your weapons.

37:44.963 --> 37:47.799
This kind of wood can withstand
extremely brutal force.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.335
So, remember:

37:49.368 --> 37:50.902
this is not about
what your sword does

37:50.936 --> 37:53.739
to the shield; what
the shield does to your swords.

37:53.772 --> 37:54.973
Craig, you're up first.
Are you ready?

37:55.006 --> 37:56.875
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

37:56.908 --> 38:03.849
*

38:11.790 --> 38:14.926
All right.
I don't see any nicks or damage.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.095
Blade's still sharp.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.464
Very nice.
Well done.

38:18.497 --> 38:21.066
- Thank you, sir.
- Good job.

38:21.099 --> 38:23.402
- All right, Paul, you're up.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.036
- Let's do this.

38:25.070 --> 38:32.010
*

38:37.082 --> 38:40.018
- All right, Paul.
I don't see any blade damage,

38:40.051 --> 38:42.821
and the edge is in good shape.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.089
I like the leather wrap
on the handle.

38:44.122 --> 38:45.524
It's nice.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.559
So, all in all, nicely done.

38:47.593 --> 38:49.928
- Thank you.
- Next up is the sharpness test.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.598
For that,
I'll give you back to Doug.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.766
- The makraka sword was used by
the Zande warriors

38:54.800 --> 38:56.535
for beheading their prisoners.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.504
To see how sharp
your weapons are,

38:58.537 --> 39:00.639
we're gonna do a mock
beheading over here.

39:00.672 --> 39:01.773
Craig, you're up first.
You ready?

39:01.807 --> 39:03.108
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.142
- All right.

39:04.175 --> 39:12.083
*

39:12.117 --> 39:13.719
- Well, Craig,

39:13.752 --> 39:15.821
on a vertical chop,
it was easy to control.

39:15.854 --> 39:19.625
My worry was about
on a horizontal chop or slice

39:19.658 --> 39:21.727
that the weight
would put pressure on my wrist.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.762
No issues whatsoever.

39:23.795 --> 39:26.632
Overall, your blade will cut.

39:26.665 --> 39:27.899
- Thank you.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.167
- Paul, you're up.
You ready?

39:29.200 --> 39:31.803
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.839
- Watching Craig's blade go
through both those watermelons,

39:33.872 --> 39:35.874
you know, now I'm hoping
that mine can do the same.

39:35.907 --> 39:38.710
If my blade can't at least
match his stroke for stroke,

39:38.744 --> 39:41.079
I'm probably gonna go home
without the $10,000.

39:41.112 --> 39:54.059
*

40:00.932 --> 40:02.834
- Okay, Paul.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.870
The feel of your blade is
a little bit on the heavy side

40:04.903 --> 40:06.838
when you're doing
a horizontal slice.

40:06.872 --> 40:09.541
It got hung up
on the watermelon.

40:09.575 --> 40:10.676
Almost cutting all the way
through, though.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.544
But on the vertical slice,

40:12.578 --> 40:16.548
it just pulls you in and easily
cuts all the way through.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.183
Your makraka will cut.

40:18.216 --> 40:20.652
- Thank you.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.187
- Craig, Paul,

40:22.220 --> 40:24.222
the judges have made
their final decision,

40:24.255 --> 40:26.157
but before I get into that,

40:26.191 --> 40:27.859
they have some feedback
for both of you.

40:27.893 --> 40:29.928
Dave?
- Paul, you brought us a piece

40:29.961 --> 40:32.531
that's got
a lot of detail work to it.

40:32.564 --> 40:34.666
The work you put
into your handle,

40:34.700 --> 40:36.502
that plait, the fuller,

40:36.535 --> 40:37.936
all of that together
is really nice,

40:37.969 --> 40:40.472
but it might have
been more beneficial

40:40.506 --> 40:42.508
to put that work into lightening

40:42.541 --> 40:43.675
and straightening that blade.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.944
But all in all,

40:45.977 --> 40:47.746
I think it's a really nice job
and it's a good looking piece.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.981
- Thank you.
- Doug?

40:50.015 --> 40:52.584
- Craig, I really like
your blade.

40:52.618 --> 40:55.153
I'll say this, it is still
one of the lightest blades

40:55.186 --> 40:57.589
I've ever used in my hands,

40:57.623 --> 40:59.591
and it's wicked sharp,

40:59.625 --> 41:02.027
showing that the light blade
can also be a great performer.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.563
- Thank you, sir.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.164
- Bladesmiths,
in just five days,

41:06.197 --> 41:07.833
you've done
some exceptional work

41:07.866 --> 41:10.101
and your blades performed
very well,

41:10.135 --> 41:11.870
but in this arena
of competition,

41:11.903 --> 41:14.540
there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" Champion,

41:14.573 --> 41:15.741
and that champion is...

41:15.774 --> 41:20.946
*

41:20.979 --> 41:22.548
Craig, congratulations,

41:22.581 --> 41:24.783
you are the "Forged in Fire"
Champion.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.284
- Thank you all.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.554
- Paul, your blade
did not make the cut.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.089
- Paul, you gave us
a powerful blade,

41:31.122 --> 41:32.891
but you fell short on sharpness.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.560
The bottom line:

41:34.593 --> 41:35.861
it underperformed
the watermelons.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.696
For that reason,
we have to let you go.

41:37.729 --> 41:39.531
*

41:39.565 --> 41:41.132
- I accomplished
what I wanted to do.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.901
There are guys on here that
have made

41:42.934 --> 41:44.302
thousands of blades

41:44.335 --> 41:45.804
and didn't make it
as far as I did.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.906
- Take care, man.

41:47.939 --> 41:49.941
- First thing I do when I get
home is I'm gonna take a nap.

41:49.975 --> 41:51.877
It was a hell of a week.
I lost five pounds.

41:51.910 --> 41:54.212
*

41:54.245 --> 41:56.815
- Craig, you are
the "Forged in Fire" Champion,

41:56.848 --> 41:59.818
and that's a title that comes
with a check for $10,000.

41:59.851 --> 42:00.986
Congratulations.
[applause]

42:01.019 --> 42:02.287
- I'm quite surprised.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.055
I never thought
I'd get this far.

42:04.089 --> 42:06.157
- Why don't you present
your blade to the judges?

42:06.191 --> 42:07.559
- I certainly didn't
walk away with this.

42:07.593 --> 42:09.194
Paul put up a fight.

42:09.227 --> 42:11.229
But I could come there
with the best-looking thing,

42:11.262 --> 42:12.998
but if it doesn't perform,
then you're out.

42:13.031 --> 42:19.170
*
