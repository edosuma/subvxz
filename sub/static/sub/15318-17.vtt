<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary...

00:01.762 --> 00:03.162
[Druitt]:
We were a part of something,

00:03.192 --> 00:04.658
something we called "the five,"

00:04.660 --> 00:06.026
a small group dedicated

00:06.028 --> 00:07.261
to expanding our knowledge
of the physical world.

00:07.478 --> 00:09.044
Helen was able to procure

00:09.046 --> 00:12.714
a very rare sample of ancient
untainted vampire blood.

00:12.716 --> 00:14.965
After each of us was injected,

00:14.967 --> 00:18.081
we received
unique gifts as a result.

00:18.083 --> 00:19.781
Griffin's molecules
became photosensitive.

00:19.783 --> 00:22.113
Watson's mind
grew to new heights,

00:22.115 --> 00:24.781
and Tesla's reaction
was the most dramatic.

00:24.783 --> 00:28.414
But Helen... her gift was
the most simple. And elegant.

00:28.416 --> 00:31.387
I'm 159 years old.
You have known me for three.

00:31.389 --> 00:32.392
It's an autotype,

00:32.394 --> 00:33.663
one of only five

00:33.665 --> 00:35.932
that were built
during the Second World War.

00:35.934 --> 00:37.802
Without it, the war could have
ended very differently.

01:59.082 --> 02:00.849
[Blows land]

02:17.910 --> 02:21.614
A bit more violent
than I expected.

02:22.177 --> 02:23.011
Uh, bad luck.

02:26.048 --> 02:27.015
Could've used a warning

02:27.017 --> 02:28.884
before you fired
that Cannon.

02:28.886 --> 02:30.619
Sorry, Nigel.
Things were heating up.

02:30.621 --> 02:32.088
You all right?

02:32.090 --> 02:33.557
Fine.

02:33.559 --> 02:35.826
Bloody freezing country,

02:52.315 --> 02:55.383
Ludicrous, parading
around Nazi France alone.

02:55.416 --> 02:57.950
Should've brought some
bloody SAS lads for safety.

02:57.952 --> 03:00.485
More men means attracting
more attention.

03:00.487 --> 03:02.520
Unlike blowing up a
checkpoint with a tank.

03:02.522 --> 03:04.622
Well, if your German
sounded more Bavarian...

03:04.624 --> 03:05.690

03:25.647 --> 03:26.880
Time is of the essence,
I'm afraid.

03:26.882 --> 03:29.316
We've only a few hours
to achieve our objective.

03:29.318 --> 03:30.951
You got our coded messages.

03:30.953 --> 03:32.553
I take it sabotage
is already underway.

03:32.555 --> 03:33.821
<i>La resistance</i>
<i>has begun</i>

03:33.823 --> 03:35.656
cutting power
and destroying rail lines,

03:35.658 --> 03:36.891
but what we do not know

03:36.893 --> 03:38.860
is when this invasion
will come.

03:38.862 --> 03:40.161
That depends on us, actually.

03:40.163 --> 03:42.263
General Eisenhower's
awaiting our signal.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.664
According to intelligence,

03:43.666 --> 03:45.966
there's an installation
near Varreville,

03:45.968 --> 03:46.901
a key
to Hitler's Atlantic Wall.

03:46.903 --> 03:48.802
How so?

03:48.804 --> 03:50.503
[Watson]: It apparently
houses a new technology

03:50.505 --> 03:52.038
developed by the Nazis,

03:52.040 --> 03:53.506
one they intend to deploy
against any approaching armada.

03:53.508 --> 03:54.407
[Magnus]:
Have you noticed

03:54.409 --> 03:56.809
any odd weather
patterns locally?

03:56.811 --> 03:58.277
As you can see,

03:58.279 --> 04:00.513
the trees have begun
to turn months early,

04:00.515 --> 04:02.348
there are failed crops
on every farm,

04:02.350 --> 04:06.686
and it rains for
hours every day.

04:06.688 --> 04:08.554
What have they created?

04:11.024 --> 04:14.460
She might as well
know the truth.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.462
We believe the SS
possess a device

04:16.464 --> 04:18.564
that can change
the weather.

04:18.565 --> 04:19.765
They could create
massive storms

04:19.767 --> 04:20.766
that could scuttle

04:20.767 --> 04:22.301
any landing attempts
on the beaches.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.936
From one device?

04:23.938 --> 04:26.872
Likely powered by a hive
of thermal sand rays

04:26.874 --> 04:28.040
to provide the energy
to power it.

04:28.042 --> 04:29.775
<i>Pardon?</i>

04:29.777 --> 04:30.776
Subterranean
desert creatures.

04:30.778 --> 04:33.912
They live off geothermal.

04:33.914 --> 04:36.514
We should know...
we deal with monsters.

04:36.516 --> 04:38.516
I deal with Nazis.

04:38.518 --> 04:39.851
I'd say we're even.

04:39.853 --> 04:41.787
Ha! I like this girl.

04:41.789 --> 04:42.954
We need to get
to Varreville,

04:42.956 --> 04:44.723
find the device,
and disable it.

04:44.725 --> 04:46.592
Otherwise, the invasion
will fail.

04:46.594 --> 04:48.460
Varreville is close.
I can take you there.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.896
It's a little more
complicated than that.

04:50.898 --> 04:51.930
We also need to find

04:51.932 --> 04:54.299
the latest schematics
for this machine.

04:54.301 --> 04:55.301
The word is the SS

04:55.303 --> 04:56.535
are keeping the
plans for the device

04:56.537 --> 04:58.637
in a town called Carentan.

04:58.639 --> 04:59.805
Is that a problem?

04:59.807 --> 05:03.709
The Gestapo have built
an underground bunker

05:03.711 --> 05:05.577
beneath this town.

05:05.579 --> 05:08.313
Many of my men have been taken
there for interrogation.

05:08.315 --> 05:09.580
None have come out.

05:09.582 --> 05:12.884
Carentan is
a very bad place.

05:22.093 --> 05:23.561
If that's more
chamomile tea,

05:23.563 --> 05:26.097
you can pour it
down the toilet.

05:26.099 --> 05:28.801
The kitchen says we're
out of black tea.

05:28.803 --> 05:30.235
Why?

05:30.237 --> 05:32.638
Because China was
invaded by Japan.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.608
Excuses.

05:35.610 --> 05:38.444
Still no word
from Dr. Magnus?

05:38.446 --> 05:39.779
Ugh.

05:39.781 --> 05:42.949
Worse than your coffee.

05:42.951 --> 05:45.552
You think they've
been captured?

05:45.554 --> 05:46.686
More that Helen
wasn't listening

05:46.688 --> 05:49.388
when I explained
how my autotype works.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.856
I'm sure they're fine.

05:50.858 --> 05:52.057
I should have
gone with them.

05:52.059 --> 05:54.992
As you know,
General Eisenhower's orders

05:54.994 --> 05:56.027
are to shoot you

05:56.029 --> 05:58.029
if you try and
get on a plane.

05:58.031 --> 05:59.197
Not that it would
really stop you,

05:59.199 --> 06:01.532
you being a vampire,
and all.

06:02.968 --> 06:05.036
Bad coffee,
English food,

06:05.038 --> 06:06.505
and worse, stuck here

06:06.507 --> 06:09.041
with the Kansas State
Glee Club.

06:09.043 --> 06:10.409
Come on, sir.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.677
Working for Allied Command
isn't so bad, is it?

06:11.679 --> 06:12.979
I work alone.

06:12.981 --> 06:15.748
But you cracked
the enigma code.

06:15.750 --> 06:16.883
It changed the tide
of the entire war.

06:16.885 --> 06:17.851
It did, didn't it?

06:17.853 --> 06:18.952
I'm just saying,

06:18.954 --> 06:21.121
you're doing
great things here, sir.

06:21.123 --> 06:25.058
The Japanese
invasion of China...

06:25.060 --> 06:26.860
What was the
inciting incident?

06:26.862 --> 06:31.064
The Marco Polo Bridge incident
of '37, wasn't it, sir?

06:31.066 --> 06:34.167
According to the war
department, yes.

06:34.169 --> 06:35.636
Or I could tell you
the truth...

06:35.638 --> 06:36.737

06:42.111 --> 06:44.011
About a hundred men,

06:44.013 --> 06:46.413
likely all to protect
SS operations

06:46.415 --> 06:49.149
in the bunker
below ground.

06:49.151 --> 06:50.884
There's only
the one entrance?

06:50.886 --> 06:52.186
Two.

06:52.188 --> 06:53.186
One is from
the mayor's office,

06:53.188 --> 06:55.689
the other is just below
Cafe Normandie.

06:55.691 --> 06:56.757
Well, I'd vote
for the cafe

06:56.759 --> 06:58.125
rather than the
mayor's office.

06:58.127 --> 06:59.860

However, before that
wondrous event,

08:22.715 --> 08:25.250
we need some information
about the upcoming invasion.

08:29.022 --> 08:32.991
You should have stayed in
England with Professor Tesla.

08:44.705 --> 08:48.875

to the bunker already.

08:48.877 --> 08:51.311

I see you've finally found
a country to call home.

09:42.636 --> 09:45.803
National Socialism suits you.

09:58.551 --> 10:00.618
that a man
born in the age of Victoria

10:00.620 --> 10:04.054
could have remained
so... spry?

10:04.056 --> 10:06.489
Oh, he does the most
unspeakable things to his blood.

10:06.491 --> 10:08.058
That is, of course,

10:08.060 --> 10:12.494
when he's not stealing it from
others in the dark of the night.

10:12.496 --> 10:14.663

But I plan on making
you afraid to live.

12:02.909 --> 12:04.843
These communiques will
not be intercepted?

12:04.845 --> 12:06.511
Not from this.

It uses a magnetic
sub frequency

12:08.182 --> 12:09.648
to speak
to its counterpart.

Tell me good news.

12:33.506 --> 12:35.841
I need to talk to Eisenhower.
Right now.

12:40.213 --> 12:42.079
Stay with me, James.

12:42.081 --> 12:44.015

is still young.

12:48.219 --> 12:51.087

concrete information.

Patience. Hmm?

12:54.292 --> 12:55.825
Now, a man

13:01.700 --> 13:03.132
The question is, why?

13:03.134 --> 13:04.334
What would cause the allies

13:04.336 --> 13:06.235

25:44.902 --> 25:46.969
Magnus missing in action.

25:46.971 --> 25:50.306
Am with 101st Airborne
under a Captain J. Zimmerman.

25:50.308 --> 25:52.041
Have evaded detection so far.

25:52.043 --> 25:55.111
Please advise. Griffin."

25:55.113 --> 25:56.212
Take this to Eisenhower,

25:56.214 --> 25:57.513
and if he says
that it's cryptic,

25:57.515 --> 25:59.148
I'll knock his teeth in.

25:59.150 --> 26:00.149
Now go.

26:00.151 --> 26:01.083
Yes, sir.

26:05.422 --> 26:08.858
It's the craziest
looking thing.

26:08.860 --> 26:12.329
At least allied command
will know the situation.

26:12.331 --> 26:14.298
If you say so.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.066
Thank you, Captain,
for getting me this far.

26:16.068 --> 26:19.370
Don't mention it.

26:19.372 --> 26:21.005
So you're off, then?

26:21.007 --> 26:22.507
Utah Beach. You?

26:22.509 --> 26:25.977
Uh, Carentan.
I have to try.

26:25.979 --> 26:29.414
Yeah, well, try and
keep your clothes on.

26:29.416 --> 26:32.884
Unlikely.

26:32.886 --> 26:35.887
You really think command'll
turn back the armada?

26:35.889 --> 26:38.089
Well, if they're
smart, they will.

26:38.091 --> 26:39.390
The weapon's still active.

26:39.392 --> 26:40.925
The landings will fail
unless we knock it out.

26:40.927 --> 26:43.627
And only this Watson fella
knows how to do this.

26:43.629 --> 26:45.428
'Fraid so.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.430
Carentan, huh?

26:47.432 --> 26:49.365
I can get help.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.972
[Zimmerman]:
Damn shooting gallery.

27:02.013 --> 27:03.714
Place is tighter'n
a Berlin rally, Captain.

27:03.716 --> 27:04.548
Krauts for days.

27:04.550 --> 27:05.917
There's no telling

27:05.919 --> 27:08.119
how long they'll keep them
both alive down there.

27:08.121 --> 27:10.021
With reinforcements,
there's got to be a way in.

27:10.023 --> 27:11.422
No offense
to your people, ma'am,

27:11.424 --> 27:13.157
but there's no way
we have enough men

27:13.159 --> 27:15.091
to bust a guy out of
an underground bunker.

27:15.093 --> 27:16.660
Not without a bloodbath.

27:16.662 --> 27:19.362
We only need to
create a distraction.

27:19.364 --> 27:20.696
Nigel will do the rest.

27:20.698 --> 27:23.499
Naked fella here?
That I'd like to see.

27:25.301 --> 27:26.368
Well, that's the tricky part,
isn't it?

27:28.638 --> 27:30.272
What the hell, man?

27:30.274 --> 27:32.407
Holy mother of God!

27:32.409 --> 27:33.375
Well, I'll be.

27:33.377 --> 27:36.111
Better than a comic book?

27:36.113 --> 27:38.314
Yeah.

27:38.316 --> 27:40.616
Why bother gathering
intelligence from us?

27:40.618 --> 27:42.919
You have the ultimate weapon
at your disposal.

27:42.921 --> 27:46.390
We don't wish
to destroy Europe,

27:46.392 --> 27:48.358
we only wish to conquer it.

27:51.329 --> 27:52.997
The invasion is set
for Norway.

27:52.999 --> 27:57.334
We came here to deal with
your weather machine,

27:57.336 --> 27:59.370
in case it threatened
future operations.

28:01.973 --> 28:03.607
I think...
I think you are bluffing.

28:03.609 --> 28:07.010
And bluffing
is an American concept.

28:07.012 --> 28:10.580
I am disappointed to see you
engage in that.

28:12.349 --> 28:16.553
You know, in Berlin,
in the Reich,

28:16.555 --> 28:19.155
I am you, Helen.

28:19.157 --> 28:21.057
May I call you Helen?

28:21.059 --> 28:23.259
Absolutely not.

28:27.565 --> 28:29.667
I command the <i> SS Ahnenerbe.</i>

28:31.002 --> 28:33.438
No doubt you have heard of us.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.107
Hitler's
abnormal hunting division.

28:36.109 --> 28:39.378
<i>Ja.</i> Very much so.

28:39.380 --> 28:42.482
We find and we capture...

28:42.484 --> 28:45.485
Beings with
powerful abnormalities

28:45.487 --> 28:46.720
to serve the Fatherland.

28:46.722 --> 28:48.589
That's an odd agenda

28:48.591 --> 28:51.092
for the champions
of racial purity.

28:51.094 --> 28:53.327
You know, let me be clear.

28:53.329 --> 28:54.561
I am not going to be the one
who kills you.

28:54.563 --> 28:55.596
That will probably

28:55.598 --> 28:58.799
be some nameless
interrogator in Berlin.

28:58.801 --> 29:00.667
I just wanted to meet you.

29:00.669 --> 29:03.036
I am such a big
fan of yours, Helen.

29:03.038 --> 29:04.471
And of yours, Dr. Watson.

29:06.007 --> 29:07.140
Not only because of

29:07.142 --> 29:09.009
your exploits
in the war.

29:09.011 --> 29:11.444
No.

29:11.446 --> 29:14.681
I admire...

29:14.683 --> 29:16.316
Your stamina.

29:16.318 --> 29:20.521
You are both
over 80 years old.

29:20.523 --> 29:23.457
And I will not let
either one of you rest

29:23.459 --> 29:25.626
until I know the reasons why.

29:27.329 --> 29:30.030
Your retinas
are burned.

29:30.032 --> 29:31.732
There's only one creature
on Earth

29:31.734 --> 29:33.300
that could cause
that exact injury.

29:33.302 --> 29:37.104
<i>Ja.</i> Oh, and
it was worth it.

29:37.106 --> 29:38.339
You're not dealing
with sand rays.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.808
You have
a Tunisian fire elemental.

29:40.810 --> 29:42.310
That's the real weapon.

29:42.312 --> 29:44.678
You needed the
weather machine...

29:44.680 --> 29:46.280
to control it.

29:46.282 --> 29:49.683
To keep it calm
until you unleash it.

29:49.685 --> 29:51.518
[Laughs] That's right.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.187
It was your invention

29:53.189 --> 29:56.757
that provided the final
piece to the puzzle.

29:56.759 --> 29:58.058
And with that,
now I can control

29:58.060 --> 30:00.528
the most powerful creature
in history.

30:00.530 --> 30:04.298
Not only
will your invasion fail...

30:04.300 --> 30:09.235
<i>You will lose the war.</i>

30:45.315 --> 30:47.750
First six on me.

30:57.162 --> 30:59.096
Sergeant.

30:59.098 --> 31:00.897
See those barrels,
12 o'clock?

31:00.899 --> 31:01.798
It's a good
firing position

31:01.800 --> 31:03.300
to cover
from the street.

31:03.302 --> 31:05.702
Take Dunne with you,
and that slapjack.

31:05.704 --> 31:07.304
And extra ammo.

31:07.306 --> 31:08.171
I'm on it, cap.

31:30.628 --> 31:32.628
What makes you think
you can control it?

31:32.630 --> 31:34.297
Well, you see,

31:34.299 --> 31:36.132
there are ancient texts
of the Phoenicians

31:36.134 --> 31:38.368
that describe this powerful
fiery beast

31:38.370 --> 31:40.303
that killed thousands
of their enemies,

31:40.305 --> 31:44.375
and then it went back
to its habitat, satiated.

31:44.377 --> 31:45.743
Ancient texts?

31:45.745 --> 31:48.280
You're basing this
all on legend?

31:48.282 --> 31:49.748
We uncovered
the creature.

31:49.750 --> 31:52.251
Under Tunis, one year ago.

31:52.253 --> 31:55.288
Perfectly preserved in a tomb.

31:55.290 --> 31:56.856
You have no idea

31:56.858 --> 31:58.024
what you're
actually dealing with.

31:58.026 --> 32:00.026
A fire elemental
can't be contained

32:00.028 --> 32:02.061
once it's been unleashed.

32:02.063 --> 32:03.929
You can't simply call it
back with a dog whistle.

32:03.931 --> 32:07.032
It will continue
to consume fuel

32:07.034 --> 32:08.333
and oxygen,

32:08.335 --> 32:11.670
for weeks, for months,
before it rests.

32:11.672 --> 32:15.440
Your master-stroke
has doomed the Reich.

32:15.442 --> 32:17.909
And probably the world.

32:17.911 --> 32:22.982
What button was it
that Herr Druitt pushed?

32:22.984 --> 32:23.816
[Cries out]

32:34.129 --> 32:34.962
[Kicks a piece of metal]

32:56.050 --> 32:58.851
I hope your boyfriend's
right about this place!

33:04.959 --> 33:06.794

33:08.130 --> 33:09.764

33:25.348 --> 33:26.882
[A blow lands]

33:40.264 --> 33:41.364

33:44.268 --> 33:45.101
No.

33:54.946 --> 33:55.780
James!

33:55.782 --> 33:57.148
James!

34:11.864 --> 34:13.097
This is goin' really well.

34:17.268 --> 34:18.802
[Whispering] Nigel? Nigel?

34:18.804 --> 34:19.969
Here.

34:25.944 --> 34:28.844
Thank God!
Nigel, help James!

34:30.581 --> 34:32.014
Thank you.

34:36.121 --> 34:37.821
Nigel, dear boy.

34:37.822 --> 34:39.922
Darling, are you all right?

34:41.159 --> 34:43.525
Schematics.
I need the schematics.

34:43.527 --> 34:44.360
They should be here.

34:48.031 --> 34:49.931
Professor?

35:03.480 --> 35:05.581
[Machine springs to life]

35:25.469 --> 35:28.871
Or just plain old
garden-variety greed?

35:28.873 --> 35:30.906
Huh?

35:34.044 --> 35:36.178
How long?

35:36.180 --> 35:40.416
I was recruited by the SS
when I was still at West Point.

35:40.418 --> 35:42.217
My family supports the Reich.

35:42.219 --> 35:43.552
It was my duty.

35:46.056 --> 35:48.491
You were good,
but I was better.

35:48.493 --> 35:50.492
How did you figure it out?

35:50.494 --> 35:51.927
Simple logic,
really.

35:51.929 --> 35:54.196
You see, Ike would never
have launched <i>Overlord</i>

35:54.198 --> 35:56.031
if he knew
that Druitt was in France.

35:56.033 --> 35:57.533
But then it suddenly
dawned on me:

35:57.535 --> 35:59.668
What if the good general
wasn't actually getting

35:59.670 --> 36:01.637
any of the information
I've been providing him with?

36:01.639 --> 36:04.206
Or worse,

36:04.208 --> 36:07.343
what if someone
tipped off the SS in Carentan

36:07.345 --> 36:10.646
about Helen
and her mission?

36:10.648 --> 36:15.719
Oh, you made me like you.

36:17.421 --> 36:18.354
He's ready.

36:21.191 --> 36:22.357
Professor...

36:22.359 --> 36:25.994
Enjoy your tribunal,
Lieutenant.

36:35.137 --> 36:37.071
[Gunfire]

36:51.288 --> 36:52.555

[Gunfire resumes]

37:18.646 --> 37:22.015
[Plane approaches]

37:28.556 --> 37:31.425
I found these grunts
looking for a fight.

37:31.427 --> 37:35.261
506th, Easy Company,
can't find their C.O.

37:48.141 --> 37:50.175
[Magnus]: 5:30.

37:50.177 --> 37:52.411
First wave of landings should
start in less than an hour,

37:52.413 --> 37:55.280
if they stick to the timetable.

37:55.282 --> 37:56.748
There it is.
Maintenance entrance.

38:00.086 --> 38:01.186
What's the plan?

38:01.188 --> 38:02.321
Kill or disable
the elemental

38:02.323 --> 38:03.556
without setting it off.

38:03.558 --> 38:04.757
Can you do it, James?

38:04.759 --> 38:07.394
Well, if you get me
inside, we have a chance.

38:07.396 --> 38:11.298
Well, it doesn't look
too hard.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.500
Something this important
I thought

38:12.502 --> 38:13.668
would be more heavily guarded.

38:13.670 --> 38:15.403
[Shell explodes]

38:35.478 --> 38:36.945
This is madness!

Get over that line!

39:00.138 --> 39:02.204
I want bazooka fire
on those tanks all day!

39:06.610 --> 39:07.676
We're going in!

39:07.678 --> 39:10.513
Keep them away
from the entrance!

39:10.515 --> 39:13.148
[Groaning]

39:17.754 --> 39:20.722
They're friendlies!
Covering fire!

39:40.175 --> 39:42.143
Oh, it's incredible.

39:45.514 --> 39:48.450
Oh... the climate
settings are all wrong!

39:48.452 --> 39:52.622
None of my safety protocols
are in place.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.090
James...

39:54.092 --> 39:56.626
There's one part of the legend
that's actually true.

39:58.329 --> 40:00.730
There's no way to really kill
a fire elemental.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.065
It's kind of

40:02.067 --> 40:04.568
why they call them
"elementals."

40:04.570 --> 40:06.236
You're telling me this now?

40:06.238 --> 40:09.239
[Shouting]

40:17.415 --> 40:19.650
It can't leave.

40:19.652 --> 40:21.619
Is there a way that
you can force it down?

40:23.321 --> 40:26.290
Air pressure change.

40:26.292 --> 40:29.259
I can create
massive wind shear.

40:29.261 --> 40:31.696
Literally bury it
in the Earth.

40:31.698 --> 40:32.930
Can you make that happen?

40:32.932 --> 40:36.767
It's not what it was
designed for, but...

40:38.536 --> 40:39.469
Hold on!

40:54.351 --> 40:56.052
N!

41:40.768 --> 41:43.436
What have you done?

41:43.438 --> 41:45.838
What I always do.
What you can't.

41:48.342 --> 41:49.543
Treat her well,
James.

officer.
