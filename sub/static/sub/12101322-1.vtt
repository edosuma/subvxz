WEBVTT

00:48.655 --> 00:50.624
The things I do for you.

00:50.656 --> 00:51.758
Excuse me, for me?

00:51.792 --> 00:53.460
Yeah, for you.

00:53.493 --> 00:55.996
Do you happen to have $30,000?

00:56.029 --> 00:58.232
No, I didn't think
so, so keep digging.

00:58.265 --> 01:01.000
Otherwise, the next grave
we're digging is our own.

01:01.033 --> 01:04.237
Okay, I will keep digging.

01:04.271 --> 01:05.105
For you.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.543
That's just childish.

01:09.310 --> 01:10.478
When
you've been in Vegas

01:10.510 --> 01:13.079
for as long as I have, you
think you've seen everything,

01:13.112 --> 01:14.849
but nothing prepared
me for this.

01:14.882 --> 01:16.216
Look at these two idiots.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.951
They think they can
solve all their problems

01:17.984 --> 01:19.887
by digging up the corpse
of Charlie Chaplin

01:19.920 --> 01:20.855
and ransoming it.

01:20.888 --> 01:23.524
Yes, that's right, you
heard me correctly.

01:23.557 --> 01:26.159
Holding a dead body
hostage to ransom it.

01:26.192 --> 01:27.227
God knows to whom.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.181
But let
me catch you up here.

02:22.215 --> 02:23.783
These two are con-men.

02:23.817 --> 02:25.718
They're not very good con-men.

02:25.752 --> 02:28.254
I'm not sure how you fail
at being a petty thief,

02:28.288 --> 02:30.625
but these two are
managing it, nonetheless.

02:31.425 --> 02:33.594
And here's why they
need the money.

02:39.199 --> 02:40.034
Get in.

02:42.703 --> 02:44.070
Whoa, whoa, hey, wait.

02:44.104 --> 02:44.939
Wait.

02:48.808 --> 02:50.911
You've been avoiding
my calls, Cal?

02:50.943 --> 02:52.712
Mr. Evans, thank God.

02:52.746 --> 02:54.181
I thought these were just,

02:55.282 --> 02:56.250
no, we haven't
been avoiding you.

02:56.282 --> 02:59.152
We've been busy earning
money to pay you back.

02:59.186 --> 03:00.888
Then you've got
the full amount.

03:03.623 --> 03:04.324
Not exactly, no.

03:05.258 --> 03:06.260
How short are you?

03:07.026 --> 03:10.296
He's about five
foot two.

03:10.330 --> 03:11.599
Terry, don't.

03:15.002 --> 03:17.605
How much is this debt again?

03:17.638 --> 03:20.307
It's 30 grand, Terry.

03:20.340 --> 03:24.945
In that case, I'm guessing
we're about $29,980 short.

03:27.347 --> 03:28.682
Wait, wait, wait.

03:28.715 --> 03:30.183
It's just a bad joke, Mr. Evans.

03:30.217 --> 03:31.218
Mr. Evans.

03:31.251 --> 03:34.855
No, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.

03:34.888 --> 03:37.358
Wait please, Mr. Evans, please.

03:37.390 --> 03:38.658
No, no, wait please, please.

03:38.692 --> 03:40.628
Hey, hey, leave him alone.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.329
Okay, okay.

03:48.001 --> 03:49.837
That's my favorite tooth.

03:49.870 --> 03:51.372
Okay look, he's just
an idiot, Mr. Evans.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.338
Please, stop.

03:52.372 --> 03:53.374
Terry, stop.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.308
I don't think your brother

03:54.342 --> 03:56.410
appreciates the gravity
of this situation.

03:56.443 --> 03:58.078
Okay Mr. Evans, I do.

03:58.110 --> 03:59.045
Okay, I do.

03:59.079 --> 04:00.013
I'm gonna get you every
penny of your money.

04:00.046 --> 04:02.282
If you boys don't
get this money pronto,

04:02.314 --> 04:04.784
then I guarantee you'll
both be digging a grave

04:04.818 --> 04:06.153
before the week is out.

04:07.319 --> 04:08.155
Let 'em out.

04:10.323 --> 04:11.325
This isn't over.

04:21.134 --> 04:21.968
What now?

04:23.903 --> 04:25.206
Now we gotta brainstorm.

04:26.338 --> 04:27.240
No distractions, Terry.

04:27.274 --> 04:29.309
We're gonna take this seriously.

04:29.341 --> 04:31.377
You realize until
the late 1860s,

04:31.411 --> 04:33.947
people thought tomatoes
were poisonous.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.081
- No they didn't.
- Yeah they did.

04:35.115 --> 04:36.016
No, they didn't.

04:36.050 --> 04:37.985
In fact, they actually
made their ketchup

04:38.017 --> 04:39.419
out of mushrooms and grapes.

04:39.452 --> 04:40.387
Don't be absurd.

04:40.420 --> 04:41.321
Think about it.

04:41.355 --> 04:43.891
A grape's just like
a tomato in texture.

04:43.923 --> 04:45.358
No it isn't, it's green.

04:45.391 --> 04:47.161
Those who hate grapes.

04:47.194 --> 04:50.230
Is it even ketchup if it
isn't made from tomatoes?

04:50.262 --> 04:51.931
- Well,
- Got you there.

04:54.134 --> 04:56.270
Thank you, very nice.

04:56.302 --> 04:58.838
Oh my, you've got to
love American breakfast.

05:08.281 --> 05:09.716
Stop it.

05:09.750 --> 05:12.019
Look at that, perfectly
even distribution.

05:12.052 --> 05:13.153
Stop it, it's weird.

05:13.185 --> 05:14.253
Stop it, knock it off.

05:14.286 --> 05:15.154
You should try it.

05:15.187 --> 05:16.423
No, thank you.

05:16.456 --> 05:17.992
Just eat your food.

05:19.192 --> 05:20.860
Don't know what
you're missing.

05:27.367 --> 05:28.367
What?

05:28.401 --> 05:29.370
They're cold.

05:31.370 --> 05:32.271
What's cold?

05:32.305 --> 05:33.507
My beans.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.141
Your beans are cold?

05:35.175 --> 05:36.009
Yeah.

05:38.310 --> 05:39.212
Well, mine aren't.

05:39.245 --> 05:41.214
Well good for you, mine are.

05:41.247 --> 05:42.449
Why can't you just eat them?

05:42.482 --> 05:43.650
You what?

05:43.682 --> 05:46.353
Can't you just for once
not be you and just eat them?

05:46.386 --> 05:47.821
What's your problem?

05:47.853 --> 05:49.389
You, you're my problem.

05:49.422 --> 05:51.225
You know that, right?

05:53.059 --> 05:54.461
You eat 'em.

05:54.494 --> 05:55.429
I've got my own.

05:55.461 --> 05:56.396
We'll swap.

05:56.428 --> 05:57.330
I thought yours were cold.

05:57.363 --> 05:58.364
They are.

05:58.398 --> 05:59.299
Then why would
I want cold beans?

05:59.331 --> 06:00.334
That's not the point.

06:00.367 --> 06:01.068
Oh, there's a
point to all this?

06:01.100 --> 06:02.336
- Yeah.
- What is it?

06:02.369 --> 06:03.504
You've made this about me.

06:03.536 --> 06:04.904
- No I didn't.
- Yes you did.

06:04.937 --> 06:05.838
No I didn't.

06:05.872 --> 06:06.473
Refill?

06:06.505 --> 06:08.241
Yes please, uh, no, no.

06:08.274 --> 06:09.108
I'm so sorry.

06:09.142 --> 06:12.245
My brother's beans
appear to be cold.

06:12.278 --> 06:13.180
How are yours?

06:13.213 --> 06:15.281
Mine are lovely,
thank you for asking.

06:15.314 --> 06:17.151
Then how could his be cold?

06:17.184 --> 06:18.519
I said the exact same thing.

06:18.552 --> 06:21.455
Excuse me, I'm
sitting right here.

06:21.487 --> 06:23.891
Oh yes, there you are.

06:23.923 --> 06:26.025
Hey Janice, can
you do another beans?

06:26.059 --> 06:27.561
Apparently, they're cold.

06:27.593 --> 06:28.562
Two beans?

06:28.595 --> 06:29.429
No, one.

06:29.461 --> 06:31.031
The other one's fine.

06:31.064 --> 06:32.232
That doesn't make sense.

06:32.264 --> 06:33.399
That's what I said.

06:33.432 --> 06:34.267
Me, too.

06:35.468 --> 06:36.403
I'm so sorry.

06:36.435 --> 06:37.937
Refill?

06:37.971 --> 06:39.506
Yes, please.

06:39.538 --> 06:41.408
Tell me, what time
do you get off?

06:41.440 --> 06:42.508
Are you kidding?

06:42.541 --> 06:44.343
Uh, no.

06:44.377 --> 06:45.045
Why?

06:45.077 --> 06:46.345
I've just never been hit on

06:46.379 --> 06:48.115
by a priest before, that's all.

06:48.148 --> 06:50.250
But this is Vegas.

06:50.283 --> 06:52.853
But we're not
actually priests.

06:52.886 --> 06:55.422
You look like priests.

06:55.454 --> 06:57.356
We're,

06:57.389 --> 06:59.459
we're chaplains.

06:59.492 --> 07:00.561
Chaplains?

07:00.593 --> 07:04.831
That's right,
we are chaplains.

07:04.865 --> 07:06.066
What's the difference?

07:06.098 --> 07:07.867
Oh, it's a different
denomination.

07:07.901 --> 07:09.336
We're allowed to date priests.

07:09.369 --> 07:10.437
You're allowed
to date priests?

07:10.470 --> 07:12.172
Not we're allowed
to date priests,

07:12.204 --> 07:13.240
I'm aware of how that sounded.

07:13.273 --> 07:16.043
We're, we're allowed to date,

07:16.076 --> 07:19.112
unlike priests who are
not allowed to date.

07:20.447 --> 07:21.415
Anything else?

07:24.084 --> 07:25.853
You understand I'm not gay.

07:25.886 --> 07:27.020
We're not gay.

07:27.052 --> 07:28.187
What's wrong with being gay?

07:28.221 --> 07:30.490
There's nothing
wrong with being gay.

07:30.523 --> 07:31.458
That's not what I was saying.

07:31.490 --> 07:33.259
Yeah, but we can't
be gay, we're brothers.

07:33.293 --> 07:35.394
So, you're not gay
because you're brothers?

07:35.427 --> 07:37.129
No, that's not
why we're not gay.

07:37.163 --> 07:38.398
We're not gay 'cause
we're not gay.

07:38.430 --> 07:41.234
But if we were gay,
we couldn't be together.

07:41.267 --> 07:43.336
Terry, would you,

07:43.370 --> 07:45.504
would you let me handle
this and you can.

07:45.538 --> 07:46.874
I'll just wait for my beans.

07:46.906 --> 07:48.141
There you go.

07:49.276 --> 07:51.078
We don't take him
out much, you know,

07:51.110 --> 07:54.247
but it's part of my sort of
community outreach program,

07:54.281 --> 07:56.516
you know, the older
members of the clergy.

07:56.548 --> 07:57.383
There you go.

07:58.617 --> 08:01.855
Well thank you,
thank you very much.

08:02.956 --> 08:03.924
God bless you.

08:06.326 --> 08:08.462
Oh, God bless you.

08:08.495 --> 08:09.930
What you have to
go and do that for?

08:09.963 --> 08:10.631
What?

08:10.663 --> 08:11.365
Make a scene.

08:11.398 --> 08:12.633
- I didn't.
- You did.

08:12.665 --> 08:14.166
No I didn't, your
beans were cold.

08:14.199 --> 08:16.336
Yeah, but I don't
like to make a fuss.

08:16.369 --> 08:17.437
Well, you didn't make a fuss.

08:17.470 --> 08:19.273
- You did.
- On your behalf,

08:19.305 --> 08:20.539
because your beans were cold.

08:20.572 --> 08:22.408
I was being assertive and manly.

08:22.442 --> 08:23.377
You know, that's
what women like.

08:23.410 --> 08:25.946
I don't need you to
man up for me, Cal.

08:25.978 --> 08:27.514
I wasn't manning
up for you, Terry.

08:27.547 --> 08:29.249
I was manning up for your beans.

08:29.281 --> 08:30.283
They were cold.

08:30.317 --> 08:31.617
Ha, ha, ha.

08:31.651 --> 08:33.320
There you go, hot beans.

08:33.352 --> 08:34.420
Well, thank you.

08:34.453 --> 08:36.055
And there you go.

08:36.089 --> 08:37.424
What's this?

08:37.456 --> 08:39.293
That's my card with my number.

08:39.326 --> 08:41.028
You can call any time.

08:41.061 --> 08:43.464
I'm a night owl,
so really anytime.

08:45.465 --> 08:46.633
Sorry you're smiling.

08:46.666 --> 08:47.600
It's okay to smile.

08:50.403 --> 08:52.206
Much better, thank you.

08:54.441 --> 08:56.109
Oh, no.

08:56.142 --> 08:57.377
What is that she gave you?

08:57.409 --> 08:58.945
Is that her number?

08:58.979 --> 08:59.913
I think it is.

09:02.481 --> 09:03.382
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

09:03.416 --> 09:05.419
I'm gonna eat that up.

09:05.451 --> 09:07.354
We're gonna go
straight to hell.

09:07.386 --> 09:08.187
What are you
talking about, why?

09:08.221 --> 09:12.058
You hit on her
dressed as a priest.

09:12.091 --> 09:13.092
But dressed as a priest

09:13.126 --> 09:15.395
doesn't mean I'm actually
a priest, you idiot.

09:16.395 --> 09:17.430
- Still.
- Still what?

09:17.464 --> 09:19.566
You think that's the
reason we're going to hell?

09:19.599 --> 09:21.100
You have a real
short memory, Terry,

09:21.134 --> 09:23.336
if you think that's why
we're going to hell.

09:28.541 --> 09:31.177
Listen, good luck, mate.

09:31.211 --> 09:32.046
What?

09:34.413 --> 09:36.316
Come here, you.

09:36.349 --> 09:37.350
You what?

09:37.384 --> 09:39.019
I recognize you.

09:39.052 --> 09:41.355
National Leprosy Day, my ass.

09:41.388 --> 09:42.990
When I got home
and told my wife,

09:43.023 --> 09:45.558
her and the kid had
a good laugh at me.

09:45.591 --> 09:47.427
Wear yellow for the lepers?

09:47.460 --> 09:49.296
Give a buck, save an ear?

09:49.328 --> 09:50.997
I look like an idiot.

09:51.030 --> 09:52.331
Where's your friend?

09:52.365 --> 09:53.633
I want my goddamn money back.

09:53.666 --> 09:56.336
No need to get agitated.

09:56.369 --> 09:58.504
Stay right there,
I'm calling the police.

09:58.538 --> 10:01.375
Dial 9-1-1, no one's
going anywhere.

10:01.408 --> 10:03.176
That's not even a real gun.

10:05.177 --> 10:06.278
Sit down!

10:06.312 --> 10:08.615
I said no one's going anywhere.

10:08.648 --> 10:11.283
I'm sure the police
are gonna love to hear

10:11.317 --> 10:14.120
about two con-men
dressed as priests.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.189
Actually, they're chaplains.

10:17.222 --> 10:18.724
Thanks for that.

10:18.758 --> 10:19.692
That wasn't for you.

10:19.725 --> 10:21.794
I can't have people
shooting guns in here.

10:21.827 --> 10:22.696
You should go.

10:25.798 --> 10:28.300
Here, for the
meals and the mess.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.602
Keep the change.

10:29.635 --> 10:31.337
He's not a bad guy, you know.

10:31.370 --> 10:32.438
Him?

10:33.139 --> 10:36.409
Not him, he's a
fucking asshole.

10:36.442 --> 10:38.778
I'm talking about my brother.

10:46.219 --> 10:48.155
Thanks for helping
me out back there.

10:48.187 --> 10:49.722
Terry, it was an incredibly
dangerous scenario.

10:49.755 --> 10:50.690
The man had a gun.

10:50.724 --> 10:52.526
I can't put myself in
that kind of danger.

10:52.558 --> 10:54.528
No shit, Sherlock, I noticed.

10:55.629 --> 10:58.298
So why did they stop thinking
tomatoes were poisonous?

10:58.331 --> 11:00.300
Oh, when they came
back from the Civil War

11:00.332 --> 11:01.201
there was a food shortage.

11:01.234 --> 11:02.269
They'd eat anything.

11:02.302 --> 11:04.437
You're making this up, Terry.

11:04.471 --> 11:05.337
No, for real.

11:05.370 --> 11:06.539
- You are.
- No.

11:07.474 --> 11:08.442
Oh, shit.

11:09.842 --> 11:11.777
Better think fast, Einstein.

11:11.811 --> 11:14.447
- Fancy watching a movie?
- Sure.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.634
I didn't know
it was a musical.

11:36.503 --> 11:38.105
It's not a musical,
it's a silent movie.

11:38.138 --> 11:39.206
I can hear music.

11:39.239 --> 11:41.375
You can't hear any sound.

11:42.509 --> 11:45.111
If I can hear it.

11:45.144 --> 11:47.413
You can't hear
any talking sound.

11:47.447 --> 11:49.349
Music isn't sound.

11:50.549 --> 11:52.585
But music is a sound.

11:52.619 --> 11:53.720
It's a silent movie, Terry.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.723
I don't know what you're,
just shut up and watch it.

11:57.823 --> 11:59.425
Why didn't they let him speak?

12:01.226 --> 12:02.261
He couldn't speak.

12:02.294 --> 12:04.197
He couldn't speak,
he was a mute?

12:04.230 --> 12:05.130
Not a mute, he couldn't speak

12:05.164 --> 12:07.700
'cause there was no
technology to speak.

12:09.335 --> 12:10.336
That's why there's no sound.

12:10.370 --> 12:12.206
That's why it's a silent movie.

12:14.374 --> 12:15.274
But there's music.

12:15.307 --> 12:16.610
I'm sitting in another seat.

12:18.344 --> 12:19.879
Do you think he had a stutter?

12:25.851 --> 12:28.721
Gotta say, he was
really something, wasn't he?

12:28.754 --> 12:29.556
Who?

12:31.423 --> 12:32.225
Charlie Chaplin, Terry.

12:32.258 --> 12:33.359
The guy we just watched.

12:33.393 --> 12:34.728
Who'd you think I was talking
about, Vladimir Putin?

12:34.760 --> 12:37.396
I prefer
Robert Downey, Junior.

12:37.429 --> 12:38.697
What?

12:38.730 --> 12:40.933
You could
hear him in his version.

12:40.966 --> 12:41.768
His version?

12:41.801 --> 12:43.470
Yeah.

12:43.503 --> 12:45.338
His version of the
life of the genius we just saw?

12:45.370 --> 12:46.305
Right.

12:46.339 --> 12:47.607
Terry, there
wouldn't be a version

12:47.639 --> 12:48.674
of the life of the
genius we just saw

12:48.707 --> 12:50.509
if there wasn't a Charlie
Chaplin to begin with.

12:50.543 --> 12:51.411
Of course not.

12:51.443 --> 12:53.379
That wouldn't make
any sense, would it?

12:54.214 --> 12:55.549
You're impossible
sometimes, you know that?

12:55.581 --> 12:56.350
So as you can see,

12:56.383 --> 12:58.218
not exactly criminal
masterminds.

12:58.250 --> 13:01.520
But there's never a shortage
of criminals in Vegas.

13:01.553 --> 13:03.722
You just have to
know where to look.

13:09.361 --> 13:11.463
Thank you, thanks
for sending the car.

13:11.496 --> 13:12.731
It's my pleasure.

13:12.764 --> 13:14.500
Car nice, was the driver nice?

13:14.533 --> 13:15.968
Beautiful.

13:16.001 --> 13:16.936
Your wheels, right?

13:16.970 --> 13:17.870
Yeah, yeah, you're
gonna love this place.

13:17.903 --> 13:20.373
I'm telling you, tonight
you'll be getting

13:20.405 --> 13:22.542
the full VIP treatment.

13:24.244 --> 13:25.478
Can't wait.

13:25.510 --> 13:27.280
Wait 'til you see
this little doll.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.448
Lakshmi.

13:36.923 --> 13:38.625
This is Mr. Evans.

13:38.658 --> 13:40.326
I want you to give him a night

13:40.360 --> 13:42.395
that he'll remember
'til he's 100.

13:43.163 --> 13:46.500
- Mr. Evans.
- Thanks, brother.

13:56.875 --> 13:59.478
I just think Robert Downey,
Junior did him better,

13:59.511 --> 14:00.345
that's all.

14:00.379 --> 14:01.615
Did a better
Chaplin than Chaplin?

14:01.648 --> 14:03.250
Yeah, 'cause we
could hear him.

14:03.283 --> 14:05.485
I mean, I know that's
not fair or anything.

14:09.522 --> 14:10.657
What are you doing?

14:10.690 --> 14:14.361
Oh, I'm trimming Bloom,
and then I'm gonna do Bruce.

14:14.394 --> 14:16.328
- Bruce and Bloom?
- Yeah.

14:16.361 --> 14:17.831
- You've named them?
- Why not?

14:17.864 --> 14:20.899
I'm sure I'm gonna
regret this, but why?

14:20.932 --> 14:24.004
Because they respond better
to a loving environment

14:24.037 --> 14:25.971
and conversation, that's why.

14:26.004 --> 14:27.474
I don't know why
you're bothering at all.

14:27.506 --> 14:28.441
It's legal now.

14:28.475 --> 14:30.777
The government doesn't
have shit like this.

14:30.809 --> 14:32.544
These things are
worth a fortune.

14:32.577 --> 14:34.247
Jesus Christ.

14:35.315 --> 14:36.349
What?

14:36.381 --> 14:37.816
I'm one good looking man.

14:37.850 --> 14:39.052
I think it's the beard.

14:39.085 --> 14:40.519
If I could bottle
this and sell it,

14:40.552 --> 14:42.956
we'd have no more
money troubles.

14:42.989 --> 14:45.625
You still wouldn't be
Charlie Chaplin rich.

14:45.658 --> 14:46.960
He was rich, wasn't he?

14:46.993 --> 14:49.596
Even he's not Robert
Downey, Junior rich.

14:49.629 --> 14:51.298
Well then Robert
Downey must have been

14:51.331 --> 14:52.599
a better Chaplin than Chaplin.

14:52.631 --> 14:54.900
Thank you, I knew
you'd have to admit that

14:54.933 --> 14:56.669
sooner rather than later.

14:56.702 --> 14:59.072
The day I'm
corrected by a fucking,

14:59.105 --> 15:00.807
By a, by a, go on.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.442
- No.
- Go on, say it.

15:03.475 --> 15:04.376
No, I told mom I wouldn't.

15:04.410 --> 15:06.445
And in front of
Bloom and Bruce, even.

15:06.479 --> 15:07.814
How dare you?

15:07.846 --> 15:09.848
Did you know that
Chaplin was worth

15:09.881 --> 15:11.550
400 million bucks when he died?

15:11.583 --> 15:12.651
That's a lot of money.

15:12.684 --> 15:14.353
That's a fuck load of money.

15:14.386 --> 15:15.488
Fucking mega money.

15:17.056 --> 15:18.892
I don't know if you
want to witness this bro,

15:18.924 --> 15:20.592
but you might learn
a thing or two.

15:20.625 --> 15:22.361
That's never happening, dude.

15:22.394 --> 15:23.062
Did you forget?

15:24.764 --> 15:25.798
Of course it's happening.

15:25.831 --> 15:27.667
She gave me her number,
she must want me to call.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.469
We'll see.

15:29.501 --> 15:30.602
- Hello?
- Hello?

15:30.635 --> 15:32.438
- Hello?
- Hello?

15:33.873 --> 15:34.708
Yeah, that's it.

15:58.764 --> 16:00.933
You can suck dick.

16:00.966 --> 16:02.668
Yeah, 'cause
it's my first time.

16:05.171 --> 16:07.540
Shultz, what are
you doing here?

16:07.572 --> 16:10.610
Well, well, same thing as you.

16:15.114 --> 16:16.983
Blowing off a little steam.

16:17.817 --> 16:18.951
Oh, good.

16:19.585 --> 16:22.122
Look, I've been meaning to call.

16:22.154 --> 16:25.891
Hey, we don't need to be
talking business tonight.

16:25.924 --> 16:26.959
No, but it's coming.

16:26.993 --> 16:28.161
I got it on the line.

16:28.193 --> 16:30.062
You must have a
lot on the line.

16:30.096 --> 16:31.965
No, they're good for it.

16:31.998 --> 16:33.800
Who?

16:33.832 --> 16:34.500
Two British boys.

16:34.533 --> 16:37.069
They got a little scheme going.

16:37.102 --> 16:38.637
What's their names?

16:38.671 --> 16:40.440
Mind your business.

16:40.472 --> 16:41.674
I'll get it.

16:42.274 --> 16:44.110
You will be paid for the delay.

16:45.144 --> 16:47.846
I thought you said we didn't
need to talk business.

16:47.879 --> 16:49.950
I'm here to enjoy myself.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.569
You're right, we don't
need to talk business.

17:15.842 --> 17:18.178
Why not kill him
before the club?

17:18.211 --> 17:19.413
I liked him.

17:20.712 --> 17:23.182
Besides, it's easier
when they're sleepy.

17:23.215 --> 17:25.551
Well good fucking
thing you don't like me.

17:26.184 --> 17:28.153
Ugh, now he's gonna be heavier.

17:28.186 --> 17:31.090
He should be lighter after
the load he just left in you.

17:32.692 --> 17:35.528
- Is Helen there?
- Hello, who you want?

17:36.229 --> 17:38.498
Is Helen there, Helen?

17:38.530 --> 17:39.898
Chicken ball special?

17:39.932 --> 17:41.233
No, I don't want
the chicken balls.

17:41.267 --> 17:43.236
Chow mein
special, right?

17:43.269 --> 17:44.304
Or the chow mein special.

17:44.336 --> 17:46.506
I think I've dialed the
wrong number, sweetheart.

17:46.538 --> 17:47.206
I've dialed the wrong number.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.974
- Hello?
- Bye.

17:49.008 --> 17:51.510
She gave you a
fucking fake number.

17:51.544 --> 17:52.946
The two could be a five.

17:52.979 --> 17:53.880
Yeah, it could be,

17:53.913 --> 17:54.881
or it could be all
the numbers are wrong.

17:54.913 --> 17:56.548
She could be dyslexic,

17:56.582 --> 17:57.517
that's why she's
written it that way.

17:57.549 --> 18:01.687
I bet, I bet that's what.

18:05.857 --> 18:08.260
Terry, it's the
Bride of Frankenstein.

18:08.294 --> 18:10.530
Hey, I hear
you two in there.

18:10.563 --> 18:12.999
You owe me money for rent.

18:13.031 --> 18:15.768
She must need the rent
money for Botox or something.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.903
Or maybe her 23rd facelift.

18:17.936 --> 18:19.204
You guys can't
keep hiding from me

18:19.238 --> 18:21.173
every time you owe me money.

18:21.207 --> 18:23.910
I'll be back tomorrow.

18:25.678 --> 18:26.713
We can add her to the list

18:26.746 --> 18:29.082
of people demanding
money from us.

18:29.115 --> 18:31.851
At least the worst thing she
can do to us is kick us out.

18:31.884 --> 18:33.185
Terry, you listening to me?

18:33.219 --> 18:35.255
Sorry, I was just
reading something here.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.789
Do you know he's
buried in Vegas?

18:37.823 --> 18:38.625
Who?

18:38.657 --> 18:40.292
- Chaplin.
- So?

18:40.326 --> 18:42.295
Oh, Jesus Christ, Cal.

18:42.327 --> 18:45.030
Charlie Chaplin, who was buried

18:45.064 --> 18:47.534
with 400 million
fucking dollars,

18:47.567 --> 18:50.769
he's buried right here in Vegas.

18:50.803 --> 18:53.039
Well, it's a shame he's
not alive then, Terry,

18:53.071 --> 18:55.040
'cause we could ask him
for a 30 grand loan,

18:55.074 --> 18:56.942
or actually he could
donate it to the lepers.

18:56.976 --> 18:58.111
That would be better.

18:58.144 --> 19:00.246
- We could dig him up.
- What?

19:00.278 --> 19:02.582
Did him up and sell his body.

19:02.615 --> 19:03.682
Sell it to who?

19:03.715 --> 19:04.483
Highest bidder.

19:04.517 --> 19:06.318
Terry, we can't
put him on Ebay.

19:06.352 --> 19:08.288
- Hollywood.
- Hollywood?

19:08.320 --> 19:09.488
Yeah, Hollywood.

19:09.521 --> 19:11.890
And what number am I dialing
to ring all of Hollywood?

19:11.923 --> 19:12.959
Any of 'em.

19:12.991 --> 19:16.562
Any one of them fuckers
would pay to get him back.

19:16.596 --> 19:18.131
- His corpse?
- Yeah.

19:18.163 --> 19:20.599
He was worth a fucking fortune.

19:24.336 --> 19:25.171
His corpse.

19:29.608 --> 19:31.076
You might be onto
something here.

19:31.777 --> 19:35.782
If we stole his body and held
it ransom like a hostage,

19:35.815 --> 19:39.318
anybody that got it back,
then they'd be a hero.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.054
Jesus, they'd be legends
in their own right,

19:41.086 --> 19:44.257
the people that safely return
Chaplin's body to the grave.

19:44.289 --> 19:46.658
I mean, you can't
buy that kind of PR.

19:46.692 --> 19:50.195
Yeah, and it'd be really good
for their public relations.

19:52.298 --> 19:53.299
We could do this.

19:54.232 --> 19:56.134
We could seriously do this.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.369
Nah, you're kidding.

19:57.403 --> 19:59.372
No, we could do this.

19:59.404 --> 20:00.306
You could be right.

20:00.339 --> 20:02.674
But I'm never right,
according to you.

20:02.708 --> 20:04.344
Well mark your
calendar, brother.

20:04.376 --> 20:06.046
This might be the first time.

20:09.248 --> 20:11.217
Previously
on Age of the Living Dead.

20:11.250 --> 20:14.721
I can't live
as a vampire, not anymore.

20:14.753 --> 20:18.591
If you left me, you wouldn't
want to see me suffer.

20:30.702 --> 20:31.337
Freeze!

20:35.374 --> 20:37.076
Claire, what are you doing?

20:37.108 --> 20:37.943
Hey, sis.

20:39.310 --> 20:42.048
These are as much mine
as they are yours.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.715
It's not, you know that.

20:43.749 --> 20:45.018
We've been through this.

20:45.050 --> 20:46.086
They're in the will.

20:46.118 --> 20:48.120
Dad left it to me as much
as he left them to you.

20:48.153 --> 20:50.056
You got paid what you were
owed from the will, Claire.

20:50.088 --> 20:51.723
You know that.

20:51.757 --> 20:54.060
Whatever, and
it's not Claire now.

20:57.863 --> 20:59.365
It's Lakshmi.

20:59.397 --> 21:00.198
Locks me?

21:00.231 --> 21:01.299
Lakshmi, L-A-K.

21:01.333 --> 21:02.869
Do I look like a lock?

21:02.902 --> 21:05.270
Okay, Lakshmi,
whatever that means.

21:05.304 --> 21:07.407
She's a Hindu goddess,
goddess of wealth

21:07.440 --> 21:11.778
and prosperity and beauty,
and she makes me feel special.

21:11.810 --> 21:13.413
Oh, you're special, all right.

21:16.915 --> 21:18.417
Do you have somewhere to stay?

21:20.051 --> 21:21.286
I sleep at the club.

21:22.988 --> 21:23.823
I see.

21:24.890 --> 21:29.262
I'm doing a lot better,
you know, than before.

21:31.196 --> 21:32.398
Okay, that's good.

21:39.337 --> 21:42.274
You don't suppose
I could have a shower

21:42.307 --> 21:44.277
and brush my teeth?

21:44.309 --> 21:45.412
Of course you could.

21:59.258 --> 22:02.495
You can see
the cogs turning, can't you?

22:02.528 --> 22:05.498
This idiot actually
thinks his drunken brother

22:05.530 --> 22:07.267
has come up with a good plan.

22:26.152 --> 22:26.920
Hello?

22:26.952 --> 22:28.320
Hey,
you sound British.

22:28.354 --> 22:29.322
Who is this?

22:29.355 --> 22:32.290
I'm a friend
of the late Mr. Evans.

22:32.324 --> 22:34.293
What do you mean, late Evans?

22:34.326 --> 22:36.229
Glad I
have your attention.

22:36.261 --> 22:38.063
We need to talk.

22:38.096 --> 22:39.298
What are we talking about?

23:00.219 --> 23:01.054
Hello?

23:03.055 --> 23:04.356
Get in.

23:04.390 --> 23:06.225
If I get in that car,
will I ever get out?

23:06.258 --> 23:08.995
Hey, let's not
pretend you have a choice.

23:24.076 --> 23:25.545
I like this with the evil
lighting and everything.

23:25.577 --> 23:27.145
It's very intimidating.

23:27.179 --> 23:28.147
What do you want?

23:28.180 --> 23:30.249
Why so hostile, pilgrim?

23:30.281 --> 23:31.384
I'm here to help.

23:31.416 --> 23:34.553
Okay, help with what?

23:34.586 --> 23:37.390
You or your idiotic brother

23:38.490 --> 23:41.294
owe $30,000 to an
associate of mine.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.695
Okay.

23:43.729 --> 23:48.268
And my associate, whom I
represent, has just retired.

23:49.500 --> 23:51.436
The guy who gave you the money.

23:52.104 --> 23:57.309
So that debt passes to my
guy, and he wants it back.

23:58.109 --> 24:02.347
He's getting ready
to retire you, too.

24:02.381 --> 24:03.349
Okay, and?

24:03.382 --> 24:07.519
And, pilgrim, I and I
alone can, shall we say,

24:08.953 --> 24:10.389
delay that inevitability.

24:11.257 --> 24:13.192
Why would you do
something like that?

24:13.224 --> 24:15.360
Because I'm a helpful guy,

24:15.394 --> 24:20.200
and because I like people
like you owing me favors.

24:23.335 --> 24:26.873
Hey, open up that bag.

24:31.911 --> 24:33.412
Nah, I'm all right.

24:33.444 --> 24:34.279
Open it.

24:44.189 --> 24:47.360
Jeez, is that a
head in the bag?

24:47.393 --> 24:48.294
What the hell's the
matter with you?

24:48.327 --> 24:50.096
Who drives around
with a head in a bag?

24:50.128 --> 24:52.163
You fucking crazy?

24:52.196 --> 24:55.300
Certainly helps
in my line of work.

24:56.067 --> 24:58.170
Okay, look, I
don't have the money.

24:58.202 --> 24:59.605
I would have just paid
back the original debt.

24:59.637 --> 25:01.339
It doesn't matter to
me if it's you or Evans

25:01.373 --> 25:03.241
or Freddy Four
Fingers I owe it to.

25:03.275 --> 25:05.311
I just don't have it,
so it's all the same.

25:05.344 --> 25:09.015
I understand that
you guys had a scam.

25:09.048 --> 25:10.249
A scam?

25:10.281 --> 25:11.583
Or a scheme.

25:11.616 --> 25:13.385
I've never known the
difference between the,

25:13.419 --> 25:17.523
I don't care, as long as
it amounts to 30K by Friday.

25:19.490 --> 25:21.359
On second thoughts, maybe
a scheme sounds better,

25:21.393 --> 25:23.930
unless it has the word
pyramid in front of it.

25:23.962 --> 25:24.696
Yeah, maybe.

25:24.730 --> 25:28.300
Maybe you think you're a cowboy

25:28.334 --> 25:32.404
and that we haven't seen a
cowboy in this town before.

25:33.172 --> 25:36.475
Look, I need a week,
a week for my scheme.

25:36.508 --> 25:38.912
All right, a week.

25:41.212 --> 25:43.182
I didn't catch your name.

25:43.214 --> 25:45.250
That's 'cause I
didn't give it to you.

25:45.284 --> 25:46.419
All right, pilgrim.

25:48.186 --> 25:50.288
We'll play it your way, but
don't you and your brother

25:50.321 --> 25:52.324
even think of skipping town.

25:53.092 --> 25:56.296
Can you let me
out here, please?

25:58.130 --> 25:58.965
Driver.

26:35.701 --> 26:38.570
Terry, Terry, wake up.

26:38.604 --> 26:39.404
Put your shoes on.

26:39.438 --> 26:41.574
What, why?

26:41.606 --> 26:42.807
Put your shoes on.

26:42.842 --> 26:44.410
'Cause the guy that was trying
to kill us has been killed.

26:44.442 --> 26:45.277
Shoes, Terry, but them on.

26:45.309 --> 26:46.611
Well, that's great news.

26:46.644 --> 26:48.713
No, it's not
great news, Terry.

26:48.747 --> 26:50.416
Where are your pants?

26:50.449 --> 26:53.119
No, not that Terry, these.

26:53.152 --> 26:55.721
He's been replaced by somebody
crazier and meaner, okay?

26:55.753 --> 26:57.423
So it's not great news.

26:57.455 --> 26:58.323
Meaner than Evans?

26:58.356 --> 27:00.393
- Yes.
- How mean?

27:00.425 --> 27:03.229
He turned up with
Evans' head in a bag.

27:03.261 --> 27:05.263
Shirt, come on.

27:05.297 --> 27:06.766
Jesus Harry Christ.

27:06.798 --> 27:08.366
That's right, we've
hit the big time.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.602
Well, what now?

27:09.634 --> 27:11.369
Now we're gonna
follow your plan,

27:11.403 --> 27:12.671
after we get some
shovels and a van.

27:12.703 --> 27:13.571
We need a van.

27:13.605 --> 27:15.274
I don't have a plan.

27:15.307 --> 27:17.777
Terry, we're
digging up Chaplin.

27:25.784 --> 27:27.720
How we gonna find
this grave, anyway?

27:29.587 --> 27:31.356
Charlie Chaplin's grave?

27:31.390 --> 27:32.358
Well, what else?

27:32.391 --> 27:33.392
We're not looking for
any other fucking grave

27:33.424 --> 27:34.793
that I know of.

27:34.826 --> 27:37.430
His name will be written
on the gravestone, Terry.

27:37.462 --> 27:38.263
That's what we're doing.

27:38.297 --> 27:39.265
We just have to read.

27:39.298 --> 27:41.099
That's convenient, isn't it?

27:41.133 --> 27:42.835
For those of us that
can read, it is, yeah.

27:42.867 --> 27:45.336
All right, well
you do that part.

27:45.369 --> 27:46.270
Why are you so mad, anyway?

27:46.305 --> 27:48.106
That's just how they
do it in cemeteries.

27:48.140 --> 27:49.675
Yeah, but I don't
like graveyards.

27:49.708 --> 27:51.444
Why, what's wrong
with graveyards?

27:51.477 --> 27:54.780
Well, they're wasted
space, aren't they?

27:54.813 --> 27:57.083
Taking up all this land.

27:57.115 --> 27:58.349
What would you have
done with the land?

27:58.383 --> 28:00.286
I'd have made
it a golf course.

28:00.318 --> 28:01.319
You don't play golf, Terry.

28:01.353 --> 28:02.254
That's not the point.

28:02.288 --> 28:04.355
Golf courses make a
shit load of money.

28:04.388 --> 28:05.623
This is just a waste of land

28:05.656 --> 28:08.093
for people who
can't appreciate it,

28:08.126 --> 28:09.294
'cause I mean, they're dead.

28:09.327 --> 28:11.497
Well, this is a waste of
time, isn't it, playing golf?

28:11.529 --> 28:13.231
You reading these gravestones?

28:13.265 --> 28:14.300
You walked right by it.

28:14.333 --> 28:16.335
Well, you didn't tell me to.

28:16.367 --> 28:17.368
We're gonna need a faster way.

28:17.402 --> 28:18.303
This'll take forever.

28:18.336 --> 28:20.506
Well here, let's
ask these old codgers.

28:20.538 --> 28:22.740
Be nice, Terry.

28:22.773 --> 28:24.609
Excuse me, awful
sorry to bother you.

28:24.643 --> 28:27.779
No bother, we're just
here doing our weekly visit.

28:27.813 --> 28:29.482
Ah, that's sweet,
someone close?

28:29.515 --> 28:30.716
My mother.

28:30.749 --> 28:32.284
Oh, that's nice,
you still come

28:32.317 --> 28:33.751
and take care of
it and everything.

28:33.785 --> 28:35.387
Well, she's my
mother, so we come

28:35.420 --> 28:37.323
- because we can't afford any,
- Yeah, right.

28:37.355 --> 28:38.190
Listen, you don't know where

28:38.223 --> 28:40.259
Charlie Chaplin's
grave is, do you?

28:40.291 --> 28:41.226
- Who?
- What?

28:41.259 --> 28:42.528
Charlie Chaplin, film star.

28:43.194 --> 28:45.396
I didn't know he's
buried in this cemetery.

28:45.430 --> 28:46.632
Yeah, it is this cemetery.

28:46.664 --> 28:47.899
It is, thank you.

28:47.932 --> 28:48.600
Cheers.

28:48.634 --> 28:50.201
I didn't know that, did you?

28:50.234 --> 28:51.703
I can't say I did, no.

28:51.737 --> 28:53.471
- Where abouts?
- What?

28:53.505 --> 28:55.374
The grave, where is it?

28:55.406 --> 28:57.475
I don't know, do I?

28:57.509 --> 28:59.411
I wouldn't be asking
you the question.

28:59.443 --> 29:00.479
I don't know.

29:00.511 --> 29:03.214
I didn't even know he was
buried in this cemetery.

29:03.248 --> 29:05.518
You learn something new
every day, don't you?

29:06.417 --> 29:07.752
Where you boys from?

29:07.786 --> 29:10.256
London, Wembley,
to be precise.

29:10.288 --> 29:11.624
Ah, where they
play the tennis.

29:11.656 --> 29:13.692
The fuck, what is it
with people and the tennis?

29:13.724 --> 29:14.526
I know, I know, I know.

29:14.559 --> 29:15.193
Thank you very much.

29:15.228 --> 29:16.095
That's Wimbledon.

29:16.127 --> 29:18.431
- All right, walk it off.
- Nice boys.

29:20.332 --> 29:21.467
Very smooth, by the way.

29:21.500 --> 29:22.268
What?

29:22.300 --> 29:24.903
- Somebody close.
- Well, it was.

29:25.804 --> 29:26.971
So what kind of
criminal mastermind

29:27.006 --> 29:30.409
tells people what we're looking
for and where we're from?

29:30.442 --> 29:31.777
Give it a rest.

29:31.809 --> 29:33.345
You think Fred and
Ginger back there

29:33.377 --> 29:35.246
are gonna rumble our plan?

29:35.279 --> 29:37.516
I'm sure tons of
people come here

29:37.548 --> 29:38.850
and ask that same question.

29:38.884 --> 29:40.352
Who's Fred and Ginger?

29:40.384 --> 29:42.654
They were, oh, nevermind.

29:44.890 --> 29:46.192
Try over there.

29:46.224 --> 29:47.025
All right.

29:47.058 --> 29:48.661
It looks exclusive
and expensive.

29:49.595 --> 29:51.829
And they don't play
tennis in Wembley.

29:51.863 --> 29:53.599
That's fucking Wimbledon.

29:53.632 --> 29:54.967
It's just the action, Terry.

29:55.000 --> 29:55.968
What do you want me to tell you?

29:56.000 --> 29:56.935
I just don't get it.

29:56.969 --> 29:58.770
Why are people always
confused about that?

29:58.804 --> 30:01.307
I don't know, why are you
so aggressive with people

30:01.339 --> 30:02.707
that are just grieving?

30:05.743 --> 30:06.913
Didn't look too sad.

30:30.434 --> 30:31.936
Oh, got an interesting
one this morning.

30:31.970 --> 30:33.038
What's up?

30:33.070 --> 30:35.440
Multiple complaints about
a fund starter account.

30:36.275 --> 30:38.509
Let me guess, IRS
collection scam?

30:38.542 --> 30:39.644
Nope.

30:39.678 --> 30:41.513
- Ethiopian prince?
- Nope.

30:41.546 --> 30:42.847
No one does that one anymore.

30:42.881 --> 30:44.383
- Fake cancer.
- Close.

30:44.415 --> 30:46.317
Go on, then.

30:46.351 --> 30:47.687
National Leprosy Day.

30:48.953 --> 30:51.389
- Leprosy?
- Yep.

30:51.423 --> 30:53.791
America has had
a leprosy outbreak?

30:53.825 --> 30:56.461
More of like a national
leprosy scam outbreak.

30:57.395 --> 30:58.431
I hate people.

30:59.798 --> 31:01.500
I'm getting the nerds in here.

31:03.734 --> 31:05.737
Give me the Cyber Crime unit.

31:05.770 --> 31:08.539
And if anyone finds my car,
let me know immediately.

31:08.573 --> 31:11.944
I don't want any charges,
just my car back.

31:11.977 --> 31:14.480
Why would someone steal
a 10 year old Mitsubishi?

31:14.512 --> 31:15.114
Who knows?

31:15.146 --> 31:16.548
You'd have to ask Lakshmi.

31:16.580 --> 31:18.683
- Who?
- Don't ask.

31:20.719 --> 31:21.554
Cocksucker.

31:23.454 --> 31:25.590
Borrows 100 grand from me,

31:25.624 --> 31:27.425
no intention of
ever paying it back.

31:29.394 --> 31:32.765
Now here he used it to start
his own loansharking business.

31:32.798 --> 31:33.633
He did.

31:34.865 --> 31:36.902
Mr. Evans.

31:36.934 --> 31:37.735
He looks good dead.

31:37.769 --> 31:39.872
He does.

31:41.472 --> 31:43.509
I wouldn't have lent
those British pricks

31:43.541 --> 31:45.278
any money in the first place.

31:46.478 --> 31:49.382
Probably spent it all
on bangers and mash.

31:51.549 --> 31:53.519
I want my money.

31:53.551 --> 31:55.987
We're working on
it, at least 20K.

31:56.922 --> 31:57.757
Good.

32:00.525 --> 32:03.429
This is hard work, digging
holes in the desert.

32:04.195 --> 32:06.831
I don't see you
doing any digging.

32:06.865 --> 32:08.599
I'm supervising you.

32:08.633 --> 32:10.303
Sorry, sorry.

32:12.037 --> 32:14.740
Jesus, got to work
for myself around here.

32:14.772 --> 32:17.041
Get this done, you schnorr.

32:17.075 --> 32:19.878
I would, except you
keep talking to me

32:19.911 --> 32:21.814
Hey Billy, a
little respect, huh?

32:21.846 --> 32:24.549
Sorry, sorry.

32:26.484 --> 32:29.754
Whoever finds
them first gets 10K.

32:35.559 --> 32:36.394
Nah.

32:41.900 --> 32:43.969
I don't know if we're
ever gonna find it.

32:47.138 --> 32:48.940
You know Tony Curtis
is in here somewhere?

32:48.973 --> 32:50.407
Is he dead?

32:50.409 --> 32:51.576
I hope so, they buried him.

32:51.609 --> 32:53.078
Oh yeah, good point.

32:56.847 --> 32:57.682
Hey.

33:01.086 --> 33:01.987
There you go.

33:02.020 --> 33:03.388
How'd you find that
if you can't read?

33:03.422 --> 33:04.789
It's got a picture on it.

33:05.891 --> 33:06.959
Well, we found him.

33:08.058 --> 33:08.894
What now?

33:09.661 --> 33:13.164
Now brother, we
turn it all around.

33:13.198 --> 33:15.768
We completely
reinvent ourselves.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.604
We be totally unpredictable.

33:22.473 --> 33:24.609
So basically exactly what
you ordered last night.

33:24.643 --> 33:25.911
That's correct.

33:25.943 --> 33:29.013
Hopefully without a
side of gunfire this time?

33:29.047 --> 33:30.449
Great diet.

33:30.481 --> 33:32.084
Yeah, but this way I
get to see you again.

33:32.116 --> 33:33.152
Because you know, the
number you gave me

33:33.184 --> 33:35.119
seemed to be a Chinese takeaway.

33:35.153 --> 33:39.491
Well, I covered for you
two last time with the cops.

33:40.226 --> 33:43.162
Yeah, we do appreciate that,
but you didn't know that,

33:43.194 --> 33:45.029
not when you gave me the number.

33:45.063 --> 33:46.999
This is Vegas.

33:47.031 --> 33:49.835
You can get whatever
you want in this town.

33:49.867 --> 33:51.636
You don't need a waitress.

33:51.670 --> 33:53.471
But you're not
just a waitress.

33:53.505 --> 33:55.775
I don't want anything else.

34:03.481 --> 34:05.517
Don't make me regret this.

34:05.549 --> 34:06.484
You don't already?

34:06.518 --> 34:08.153
No, it wasn't you.

34:08.185 --> 34:11.155
Oh.

34:11.188 --> 34:13.090
That wasn't nice.

34:13.123 --> 34:14.892
You probably deserved it.

34:14.925 --> 34:15.860
Why?

34:15.893 --> 34:17.562
I don't know Terry,
because you're you?

34:17.596 --> 34:20.164
Why do you always get
all the girls and I don't?

34:20.197 --> 34:22.467
I don't know, because you've
got the demeanor of Eeyore,

34:22.501 --> 34:23.469
what do you want me to tell you?

34:23.501 --> 34:24.536
Fuck you, Tigger.

34:24.568 --> 34:25.503
I'm a nice guy.

34:25.536 --> 34:26.471
Oh, you're a nice guy?

34:26.505 --> 34:28.173
Why don't you rustle
us up some cash then?

34:28.206 --> 34:29.842
I'm working on that.

34:29.875 --> 34:30.675
Sure you are.

34:31.543 --> 34:32.510
Oh my God, what is that?

34:32.543 --> 34:34.179
That, my not so smart brother,

34:34.211 --> 34:36.215
is the answer to
all our problems.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.483
I beg your pardon?

34:37.516 --> 34:38.317
Our problem?

34:38.349 --> 34:39.485
- Yeah, our problem.
- Our problem,

34:39.518 --> 34:40.853
as in yours and mine?

34:40.885 --> 34:42.621
- Yeah.
- Our problem?

34:42.653 --> 34:43.487
That's right.

34:43.521 --> 34:45.523
When you took
$30,000 of our money,

34:45.556 --> 34:47.625
money that we borrowed
from a gangster,

34:47.659 --> 34:49.728
and put it all on a
50 to one long shot

34:49.760 --> 34:51.496
because your
horoscope told you to,

34:51.530 --> 34:53.065
that becomes our problem?

34:53.097 --> 34:54.833
Don't knock astrology.

34:54.865 --> 34:56.501
It's a science.

34:56.534 --> 34:58.170
- It's not a science.
- I'm a Capricorn.

34:58.202 --> 34:59.670
I'm a Pisces.

34:59.704 --> 35:01.673
- That makes us compatible.
- That is so weird,

35:01.706 --> 35:03.108
but you know what, I
could feel it between us.

35:03.141 --> 35:04.677
We have that sort of energy.

35:06.545 --> 35:09.715
It's mumbo jumbo, superstitious
claptrap and you know it is.

35:09.748 --> 35:10.548
Really?

35:10.581 --> 35:11.782
I'm a Pisces.

35:11.815 --> 35:13.084
You're a Leo.

35:13.117 --> 35:14.552
Now tell me what that is.

35:16.054 --> 35:19.124
I opened a fund starter
account for leprosy.

35:22.661 --> 35:23.329
You did what?

35:23.362 --> 35:25.197
The donations are pouring in.

35:25.230 --> 35:26.264
- The donations.
- Uh huh.

35:26.297 --> 35:28.833
And how are you gonna
get the donations, Terry?

35:28.867 --> 35:31.769
I also opened a Western
Post account online.

35:31.802 --> 35:33.605
You're outrageous.

35:33.637 --> 35:35.973
And you always think
I'm the stupid one.

35:36.007 --> 35:37.909
How'd you like them apples?

35:37.943 --> 35:39.211
It's wire fraud.

35:39.244 --> 35:40.079
What?

35:40.711 --> 35:43.315
It's wire fraud, you idiot.

35:43.347 --> 35:45.250
The minute you try and
touch a penny of that money,

35:45.282 --> 35:46.284
it's wire fraud.

35:46.318 --> 35:48.086
That's 10 years inside, Terry.

35:48.119 --> 35:50.222
- 10 years?
- 10, Terry, 10.

35:50.255 --> 35:51.256
You can count, right?

35:51.289 --> 35:52.291
One, two, three, four, five,

35:52.324 --> 35:53.724
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

35:53.757 --> 35:55.126
10 years.

35:55.159 --> 35:56.795
I'm not going back
in there for 10 years.

35:56.827 --> 35:57.461
Why are you such an idiot?

35:57.496 --> 35:59.097
I feel like I'm babysitting

35:59.130 --> 36:01.267
a special needs
giraffe or something.

36:02.867 --> 36:04.635
I barely got
through last stretch.

36:04.668 --> 36:06.203
That was only 18 months.

36:06.237 --> 36:08.106
And Michael's still in
there because of what you did,

36:08.139 --> 36:10.208
so we need a plan that doesn't
get us banged up, okay?

36:10.240 --> 36:11.643
And that isn't this one.

36:13.344 --> 36:14.645
Well what, then?

36:14.679 --> 36:15.581
Chaplin.

36:15.614 --> 36:16.882
We have a plan.

36:17.514 --> 36:20.351
- It's over three grand.
- Oh my God, no.

36:20.385 --> 36:23.188
This is dead, dead to us
like mom is dead to us, okay?

36:23.221 --> 36:24.822
You leave mom out of this.

36:25.523 --> 36:28.093
If you two would like to
settle up, I can get going.

36:28.126 --> 36:30.129
Yes, of course we can.

36:31.329 --> 36:33.031
Here, keep the change.

36:33.063 --> 36:35.266
- It's $21.80.
- For breakfast?

36:35.300 --> 36:39.037
Yes, so could you
just please pay?

36:39.070 --> 36:39.905
Here.

36:41.405 --> 36:42.974
Do I still get
to keep the change?

36:43.007 --> 36:43.908
Sure.

36:45.275 --> 36:46.144
No, wait.

36:46.844 --> 36:48.312
I'll see
you tomorrow, Janice.

36:48.346 --> 36:50.916
Wait, wait, whoa.

36:50.949 --> 36:51.916
What do you want?

36:51.949 --> 36:52.817
Just a date.

36:52.851 --> 36:54.353
You feel like trouble.

36:54.385 --> 36:56.221
I'm not.

36:56.253 --> 36:58.289
Like a small amount of trouble.

36:58.322 --> 36:59.991
A Pisces amount of trouble.

37:00.025 --> 37:01.626
I could do with less
trouble in my life.

37:01.659 --> 37:03.694
I get that, but
let me tell you

37:03.728 --> 37:05.163
why I might be worth
the trouble, though.

37:05.195 --> 37:06.063
- Wow.
- No, no.

37:06.097 --> 37:09.001
Listen to my accent.

37:09.034 --> 37:10.702
Everything sounds better
in an English accent.

37:10.735 --> 37:12.037
Is that it, a British accent?

37:12.070 --> 37:13.939
English, English accent.

37:13.972 --> 37:16.274
British accent is
Scotland and Wales.

37:16.306 --> 37:18.943
If you've ever heard
a Welsh person speak,

37:18.976 --> 37:20.177
it doesn't matter.

37:20.211 --> 37:22.246
I was kind of expecting a
list of reasons or something.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.348
A list, I can do a list.

37:23.380 --> 37:24.415
A long list or a short list?

37:24.449 --> 37:26.151
- Long list.
- How long?

37:26.184 --> 37:27.386
Like Schindler's list.

37:28.786 --> 37:30.855
I'm not sure why I said that.

37:30.889 --> 37:32.190
I'm so sorry.

37:32.222 --> 37:34.925
Why are boys so stupid?

37:34.958 --> 37:37.195
It's probably just to
make you feel sorry for us.

37:38.429 --> 37:39.632
I'll let you know.

37:41.231 --> 37:42.233
All right.

37:43.902 --> 37:44.737
She'll be back.

37:45.402 --> 37:47.105
She has to be.

37:47.137 --> 37:50.041
- She does work here.
- Shut up, Terry.

37:52.744 --> 37:53.445
What do you think?

37:53.478 --> 37:54.679
Pretty standard.

37:54.713 --> 37:57.749
Opened a Western Post account
using their own IP address.

37:57.782 --> 38:00.085
I can tell you what city, state,

38:00.117 --> 38:02.887
possibly a home
address by the morning.

38:02.920 --> 38:05.222
- Why so long?
- Glitch in the system.

38:05.255 --> 38:07.759
I could have that
for you tonight.

38:07.791 --> 38:08.760
I got this.

38:46.797 --> 38:48.433
You sure about this?

38:50.869 --> 38:52.971
You know a better idea?

39:30.375 --> 39:31.744
- Hello.
- Hey.

39:33.878 --> 39:35.981
That's great, I'm just
gonna have a coffee.

39:36.014 --> 39:36.949
Not eating today?

39:36.981 --> 39:39.317
No, I'm waiting for
a couple of friends.

39:39.349 --> 39:41.886
- I'll get some more menus.
- Thank you.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.289
Hey, what's your name?

39:44.322 --> 39:45.123
Helen.

39:45.155 --> 39:47.224
- Hello, Helen.
- Hi.

39:47.257 --> 39:49.160
Maybe you know my friends.

39:49.193 --> 39:51.295
British dudes, brothers.

39:52.496 --> 39:54.199
They come in here a lot.

39:55.300 --> 39:57.235
Don't think so.

39:57.268 --> 39:58.503
I'll go get those menus.

39:58.536 --> 40:00.238
You sure?

40:00.271 --> 40:01.807
They have very distinct accents,

40:01.840 --> 40:04.042
so it would be
hard to miss them.

40:04.074 --> 40:06.243
I think I'd remember accents.

40:06.277 --> 40:07.880
I think you would, too.

40:13.083 --> 40:14.352
I'll go get those menus.

40:24.161 --> 40:26.230
At least there's
a full moon out.

40:26.264 --> 40:28.432
Proves astrology's a science.

40:28.465 --> 40:30.000
- What does?
- The moon.

40:30.034 --> 40:31.970
How does it prove that
astrology's a science?

40:32.003 --> 40:34.940
Are you actually gonna get
in here today and do anything?

40:34.972 --> 40:36.373
I'm supervising, Terry.

40:36.407 --> 40:38.343
I'm keeping a lookout.

40:38.376 --> 40:40.579
Making sure you're safe,
like I'm always doing.

40:40.612 --> 40:42.146
Go on, why don't you
talk about the moon.

40:42.179 --> 40:44.014
Tell me about that
whilst you work.

40:44.047 --> 40:44.882
Tides.

40:46.217 --> 40:47.018
What about them?

40:47.050 --> 40:48.452
- You've heard of tides.
- Yes Terry,

40:48.485 --> 40:49.887
I've heard of tides.

40:49.920 --> 40:53.090
Well the moon
causes the tides.

40:53.123 --> 40:54.391
Scientific fact.

40:54.425 --> 40:55.493
Okay.

40:55.525 --> 41:00.065
The human body, 90% water,
another scientific fact.

41:00.097 --> 41:02.032
- 70%.
- Don't quibble all the time.

41:02.065 --> 41:03.634
Fine, fine, it's mostly water.

41:03.668 --> 41:05.871
Mostly water, so what?

41:05.903 --> 41:09.474
Since the moon can affect
something as mighty as an ocean,

41:09.507 --> 41:13.010
do you think something as
inconsequential as we are

41:13.043 --> 41:16.214
on a cosmic scale won't
be affected by it?

41:17.416 --> 41:20.552
That is the biggest load
of rubbish I have ever heard.

41:20.585 --> 41:21.920
It's science.

41:21.952 --> 41:22.586
No, it's not.

41:22.619 --> 41:24.121
What about ponds?

41:24.155 --> 41:25.123
What about them?

41:25.155 --> 41:26.324
There's a large body of water.

41:26.356 --> 41:27.291
They don't have tides.

41:27.324 --> 41:28.525
What about the bathtub?

41:28.559 --> 41:30.327
You don't get an extra
splish or a splosh

41:30.360 --> 41:31.962
just 'cause there's
a full moon out.

41:40.605 --> 41:43.407
Well done, my son, well done.

42:36.193 --> 42:37.628
Wait, wait.

42:37.661 --> 42:39.530
Are we supposed to be
pulling or pushing?

42:39.563 --> 42:41.465
You pull him in, Cal.

42:49.373 --> 42:50.308
What, no.

42:51.675 --> 42:54.244
Wait a second, wait a second.

42:54.277 --> 42:55.480
Hey, how are you?

42:56.280 --> 43:01.019
I'm good, I'm just hanging
out with my brother.

43:01.052 --> 43:02.754
- Really?
- Be there in a sec, Terry.

43:02.786 --> 43:04.288
What was that?

43:04.322 --> 43:07.025
Okay, well then I
owe you 200 bucks.

43:07.057 --> 43:08.159
For not taking the bribe.

43:08.193 --> 43:12.030
Look, how about I give it
to you later over drinks?

43:12.063 --> 43:16.034
This better not be just you
trying to get your dick wet.

43:16.067 --> 43:17.168
You got it.

43:19.603 --> 43:20.438
Problem?

43:21.572 --> 43:23.742
Somebody just asking after us.

43:23.775 --> 43:25.677
No prizes for
guessing who that is.

43:25.710 --> 43:27.445
I've got a problem.

43:28.679 --> 43:30.081
Yeah.

43:30.114 --> 43:31.349
Oh, yeah, yeah.

43:32.349 --> 43:33.552
Sorry, sorry bro.

43:34.619 --> 43:35.620
Come on, push.

43:35.652 --> 43:37.088
I am pushing.

43:45.695 --> 43:47.431
Dude, what the fuck is it now?

43:49.300 --> 43:50.468
Hey, you called me.

43:50.501 --> 43:51.769
All right, listen.

43:51.802 --> 43:53.570
I need you to do something
for me, it's important.

43:53.603 --> 43:56.573
I need you to find
two Brits right away.

43:56.606 --> 43:57.509
Names.

43:57.541 --> 43:58.643
I don't have the names yet.

43:58.675 --> 43:59.744
You know what, without names.

43:59.777 --> 44:01.679
Dude, dude, find them, okay?

44:01.711 --> 44:02.480
It's important.

44:02.512 --> 44:03.547
Do what we fucking
pay you to do.

44:03.581 --> 44:06.418
Two fucking Brits, they
both have English accents.

44:06.451 --> 44:07.385
Hey, where the
fuck is my money

44:07.418 --> 44:10.355
for the last two favors
I did for you guys?

44:10.387 --> 44:11.456
Michael pays the bills.

44:11.489 --> 44:12.356
He said you would.

44:12.389 --> 44:13.357
Just relax, all right?

44:13.391 --> 44:14.192
We always fucking pay.

44:14.224 --> 44:16.460
You making big
money anywhere else?

44:18.596 --> 44:21.266
I'm working a tip.

44:21.298 --> 44:22.300
- What?
- On a fraud.

44:22.333 --> 44:24.235
Fraud, I'm not a cop.

44:24.268 --> 44:25.503
What do I give a
shit about fraud for?

44:25.536 --> 44:28.440
- It's about leprosy.
- Leprosy?

44:28.472 --> 44:31.108
How the fuck could
a leper be a fraud?

44:31.141 --> 44:33.077
They don't even have
any fucking fingers.

44:33.811 --> 44:34.846
I gotta go.

44:34.878 --> 44:37.614
Hey, find those fucking
Brits, it's important.

44:37.648 --> 44:39.217
They both have English accents.

44:39.250 --> 44:40.085
Find them.

44:41.186 --> 44:44.689
Fucking idiots, I'm
surrounded by fucking idiots.

45:00.838 --> 45:01.506
Sit anywhere you'd like.

45:01.539 --> 45:03.307
I'll be with you in a minute.

45:03.340 --> 45:05.374
We're not here to eat.

45:06.244 --> 45:07.345
Make it quick, I'm busy.

45:07.378 --> 45:08.480
Is the owner around?

45:09.413 --> 45:11.115
Nope, he lives in Hong Kong.

45:11.148 --> 45:12.750
- Hong Kong?
- Yep.

45:12.782 --> 45:15.152
Just waiting for the development
up the street to finish

45:15.186 --> 45:16.488
and then it's demolition time.

45:16.521 --> 45:17.422
You the manager?

45:17.454 --> 45:19.490
Might as well be.

45:19.523 --> 45:21.525
The wifi network from
this diner was used

45:21.559 --> 45:23.695
to set up a fraudulent account.

45:23.728 --> 45:24.896
So?

45:24.929 --> 45:26.530
It was used in a
fraudulent scheme,

45:26.563 --> 45:28.132
which is a crime in
the state of Nevada,

45:28.166 --> 45:29.334
and anyone that
helps these people.

45:29.367 --> 45:31.402
Every bum, grifter
and con artist

45:31.434 --> 45:33.371
around the neighborhood
use the free wifi.

45:33.403 --> 45:36.173
They also get their mail
too, and we keep it for them.

45:36.206 --> 45:37.375
Can we see it?

45:37.407 --> 45:38.409
What?

45:38.442 --> 45:39.878
The mail.

45:39.911 --> 45:40.846
Got a warrant?

45:42.346 --> 45:43.380
We'll be back.

45:44.282 --> 45:45.450
See ya then, Arnie.

45:54.592 --> 45:58.864
Jeez, you startled me.

46:05.503 --> 46:07.572
What've you got?

46:07.605 --> 46:09.407
Those two brothers
you asked me about?

46:09.440 --> 46:11.876
Yeah, what about them?

46:11.909 --> 46:14.811
They in a lot of trouble?

46:14.844 --> 46:15.913
Why?

46:15.947 --> 46:17.215
Just wondering.

46:18.682 --> 46:19.317
Not really.

46:19.351 --> 46:21.186
I just need to talk to them.

46:21.219 --> 46:21.987
I don't want to get myself

46:22.019 --> 46:23.320
into the middle of
something nasty.

46:23.353 --> 46:24.755
You won't.

46:24.789 --> 46:26.891
I'm trying to help them.

46:26.923 --> 46:30.461
I'm offering them an
olive branch so things

46:31.728 --> 46:34.198
Look, money talks.

46:35.532 --> 46:37.536
If you don't talk,
you don't get any.

46:38.635 --> 46:40.237
I could find them for you.

46:42.907 --> 46:44.409
When?

46:44.442 --> 46:45.710
I'll call you tomorrow.

46:49.012 --> 46:50.382
Make sure you do.

47:15.505 --> 47:18.609
Jeez, you'd think the bastard
would have lost some weight.

47:18.643 --> 47:20.411
He wasn't that
heavy to start with.

47:20.443 --> 47:21.579
Wait, wait there a minute.

47:21.612 --> 47:23.748
Show some respect,
for Christ sake.

47:23.780 --> 47:24.681
He's an icon.

47:24.715 --> 47:25.682
Respect?

47:25.715 --> 47:26.884
We just dug him up.

47:26.916 --> 47:29.820
That doesn't mean you have
to disrespect him, does it?

47:32.523 --> 47:33.423
This better be worth it.

47:33.456 --> 47:35.659
This thing weighs a ton.

47:35.693 --> 47:38.830
It's a one-time big
effort for a big payday.

47:41.465 --> 47:43.034
Just keep moving.

47:43.067 --> 47:43.867
I am.

47:43.900 --> 47:44.969
- Wait, wait.
- What?

47:49.507 --> 47:51.509
- Oh, it's her.
- No.

47:51.541 --> 47:52.376
I won't be long.

47:52.409 --> 47:53.877
I'm not babysitting him.

47:53.911 --> 47:55.046
You don't have to babysit.

47:55.079 --> 47:58.883
You can go out, you
know, or just don't.

47:58.916 --> 47:59.751
Come on.

48:03.621 --> 48:04.456
Sorry.

48:08.858 --> 48:10.862
So, pretty nice place, huh?

48:10.894 --> 48:12.063
I'm not going
to sleep with you.

48:12.096 --> 48:14.599
Do you mean
tonight, or like ever?

48:14.632 --> 48:15.967
Wow.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.534
'Cause we can order oysters.

48:17.568 --> 48:19.437
I'll stick with a martini.

48:19.469 --> 48:20.937
Good choice, me too.

48:20.971 --> 48:22.773
That's not a martini.

48:22.806 --> 48:23.440
Oh, that's a martini.

48:23.474 --> 48:25.509
This is a Hawaiian martini.

48:25.543 --> 48:26.411
Never heard of it.

48:26.443 --> 48:28.445
It's delicious,
you need to try it.

48:28.478 --> 48:29.480
I see you looking at it.

48:29.512 --> 48:31.014
You want to try
it, I can see you.

48:31.047 --> 48:32.349
Will you stop talking
about it if I do?

48:32.382 --> 48:33.585
I will if you try it.

48:34.684 --> 48:35.519
All right.

48:36.653 --> 48:38.789
- Whoa, whoa.
- What?

48:38.822 --> 48:41.826
Wait, you need to remember
your life as it is now,

48:41.858 --> 48:43.927
pre-Hawaiian martini.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.829
You're gonna be so mad
at me once you try this

48:45.862 --> 48:48.699
that it isn't the very first
thing I told you about.

48:48.733 --> 48:50.501
Okay, you ready?

48:50.534 --> 48:51.369
Go.

48:54.505 --> 48:55.472
And, boom.

48:57.875 --> 49:00.510
- It's okay.
- You're such a liar.

49:00.543 --> 49:02.980
Oh my God, it's more than okay.

49:03.012 --> 49:04.213
It's a little
better than okay.

49:04.248 --> 49:06.818
It is the finest drink to
ever touch those gorgeous lips,

49:06.851 --> 49:07.619
and you know it is.

49:07.652 --> 49:09.721
You need to stop
hitting on me.

49:09.753 --> 49:10.889
Why?

49:10.922 --> 49:12.490
And stop saying things to
try and make me love you.

49:12.523 --> 49:13.825
Oh my God, you love me?

49:13.858 --> 49:15.460
That is so sudden, but okay.

49:15.492 --> 49:17.362
You should try and
play it cool, you know?

49:17.394 --> 49:18.429
Knock it off.

49:20.597 --> 49:22.366
You can't blame a guy
for wanting something real.

49:22.400 --> 49:23.367
Real?

49:23.400 --> 49:25.435
Well, not fish love, anyway.

49:25.469 --> 49:27.438
- What?
- Fish love?

49:27.471 --> 49:28.907
What the hell is fish love?

49:29.907 --> 49:31.708
There's a rabbi and he
sees a guy eating a fish

49:31.742 --> 49:34.379
and he says to him, why
are you eating fish?

49:34.411 --> 49:36.380
The guy looks back
at him all confused

49:36.414 --> 49:38.149
and he goes, I love fish.

49:38.181 --> 49:40.417
He goes oh, you love fish.

49:40.451 --> 49:42.420
That's why you killed
it, cooked it and ate it?

49:42.452 --> 49:44.389
And the guy says, oh,
you know what I mean.

49:44.422 --> 49:46.423
He goes to him, you
love the taste of fish.

49:46.456 --> 49:47.657
You don't love fish itself.

49:47.692 --> 49:50.161
If you loved the fish, he'd
still be swimming in the stream.

49:50.193 --> 49:52.429
It's just self gratification.

49:52.463 --> 49:54.865
You like the way it tastes,
the way it makes you feel.

49:54.898 --> 49:56.534
Well, that's just fish love.

49:56.567 --> 49:59.403
So much of what's in the
world today is fish love.

50:00.271 --> 50:02.140
Somebody taking something
from somebody else

50:02.172 --> 50:04.474
just because of the
way it makes them feel.

50:04.507 --> 50:07.846
Even if you don't date me,
don't settle for fish love.

50:08.978 --> 50:10.181
Did you come up with that?

50:10.213 --> 50:11.648
- No.
- So who did?

50:11.681 --> 50:12.616
Wayne Newton.

50:12.650 --> 50:14.050
You are so full of it.

50:14.083 --> 50:15.852
I'm not, he sat
right in this chair,

50:15.885 --> 50:17.721
told me that story,
made me try that drink,

50:17.755 --> 50:18.655
and I never looked back.

50:18.688 --> 50:19.990
Is anything you say the truth?

50:20.023 --> 50:21.692
Everything I tell
you is the truth.

50:21.724 --> 50:26.730
That's probably not true,
but I like the way you say it.

50:27.197 --> 50:29.800
Well in that case,
Greg, two more, please.

50:29.833 --> 50:31.568
Now you're just
trying to get me drunk.

50:31.601 --> 50:32.469
That's also true.

50:32.503 --> 50:34.572
See, we could play
this game all night.

50:36.507 --> 50:37.942
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

50:51.588 --> 50:52.590
There
are some men in life

50:52.623 --> 50:55.192
you're going to come
across who are just evil.

50:55.226 --> 50:56.394
I mean, they are brutes.

50:56.427 --> 51:00.198
They are the spies and the
type of men that enslave you.

51:00.231 --> 51:01.899
They regiment your life.

51:01.931 --> 51:04.868
They tell you what to do,
what to think, what to feel.

51:04.902 --> 51:07.972
They drill you, diet you,
treat you like cattle.

51:08.005 --> 51:09.173
They use you.

51:09.206 --> 51:12.076
They use everyone like cannon
fodder, but you know what?

51:12.108 --> 51:14.644
They're honest about it.

51:14.677 --> 51:18.748
They are who they are,
just brutes, dictators.

51:18.782 --> 51:20.184
They are evil men.

51:20.885 --> 51:22.687
But the people I
despise more than them

51:22.719 --> 51:25.121
are the ones that
dress like heroes

51:25.155 --> 51:27.057
but would sell you
out in a heartbeat.

51:28.259 --> 51:30.094
Detective, how are you?

51:31.228 --> 51:32.195
Fine.

51:32.228 --> 51:33.897
What brings you here?

51:34.965 --> 51:36.000
I have some information

51:36.032 --> 51:37.101
- Not here.
- that might be

51:37.134 --> 51:39.202
- of use to you.
- Not here.

51:39.235 --> 51:40.737
- Billy hasn't been paying.
- Shut up.

51:40.771 --> 51:42.707
- For information I provide.
- Hey, hey.

51:42.739 --> 51:45.675
What, are you fucking stupid?

51:45.708 --> 51:46.977
Excuse me?

51:47.010 --> 51:48.179
You're a snitch.

51:48.211 --> 51:50.914
You've been bought
and paid for already.

51:50.947 --> 51:54.184
We don't have to pay
you anything anymore.

51:54.217 --> 51:55.118
Look, look.

51:56.619 --> 52:00.056
Take a look at it.

52:00.090 --> 52:04.262
That's you taking our
cash for your information.

52:05.563 --> 52:06.797
We own you.

52:06.829 --> 52:09.199
We don't have to pay
you any money anymore,

52:09.233 --> 52:13.571
but you've gotta continue
to pay me with information.

52:13.603 --> 52:15.605
Otherwise I'll make damn sure

52:15.639 --> 52:18.710
that your boss will see
those pictures like that.

52:21.045 --> 52:22.613
You need me as a friend.

52:22.646 --> 52:26.317
Maybe you don't
need us as an enemy.

52:26.349 --> 52:27.183
You know what?

52:27.217 --> 52:29.320
Get the fuck outta here.

52:29.353 --> 52:31.322
Here, here's some gas money.

52:31.355 --> 52:35.592
Hit the road and don't be
bothering Mr. Hynkel anymore.

52:51.240 --> 52:52.742
How was the date?

52:52.775 --> 52:54.177
It went very well, thank you.

52:54.210 --> 52:55.145
Really?

52:55.179 --> 52:56.947
Then how come you're
sitting here with me?

52:58.748 --> 53:01.651
Because I am a
gentleman, Terry.

53:01.684 --> 53:03.320
So she won't bang you, then?

53:03.353 --> 53:07.291
That is so, so factual.

53:09.159 --> 53:10.994
But it was a classy
place, Champagne's.

53:11.027 --> 53:13.597
I was trying to
project a classy image.

53:13.630 --> 53:14.498
How classy?

53:14.532 --> 53:16.100
They don't serve
Red Bull as a mixer.

53:16.132 --> 53:17.968
- Ooh, that is classy.
- I know, right?

53:18.001 --> 53:19.369
Gonna see her again?

53:19.402 --> 53:20.804
Tonight.

53:20.838 --> 53:22.073
Same place?

53:22.106 --> 53:23.307
Why fix it if it ain't broke?

53:23.340 --> 53:25.142
Yeah, that and the
fact that you and me

53:25.175 --> 53:28.245
are barred from virtually
every other bar in Vegas.

53:28.277 --> 53:31.247
Which reminds me, I needed
to tell you something,

53:31.280 --> 53:33.083
and I hope this doesn't
come as a complete surprise,

53:33.117 --> 53:37.188
but Terry, I wasn't fucking
planning on taking you.

53:37.221 --> 53:38.688
No shit.

53:38.722 --> 53:40.658
- Hey, whoa.
- What?

53:40.690 --> 53:42.792
Show some respect,
use a coaster.

53:42.826 --> 53:44.362
Do we have any coasters?

53:44.394 --> 53:46.230
You could fashion
one out of something,

53:46.262 --> 53:47.230
you know you could, Terry.

53:47.264 --> 53:48.265
I tell you what I'll do.

53:48.297 --> 53:50.266
If and when we sell this guy,

53:50.300 --> 53:54.672
I'll use part of the proceeds
to buy some coasters.

53:55.905 --> 53:59.043
So, now that we have said body,

54:00.376 --> 54:02.980
how exactly do we monetize it?

54:04.414 --> 54:06.083
- Monetize it?
- Yeah, what it means is,

54:06.115 --> 54:08.318
I know what it means.

54:08.351 --> 54:09.987
I'm surprised to hear
you saying the word.

54:10.019 --> 54:11.389
Go on, then.

54:11.422 --> 54:12.956
We're gonna ransom
it to the family

54:12.989 --> 54:14.357
or a Hollywood type, remember?

54:14.391 --> 54:16.126
And you have a phone number

54:16.159 --> 54:17.795
for some of these
Hollywood types?

54:17.827 --> 54:18.762
Oh my God, Terry,

54:18.795 --> 54:20.797
I'm following the plan
that you laid down.

54:20.831 --> 54:21.766
I was drunk.

54:21.798 --> 54:23.367
You're always drunk.

54:26.202 --> 54:27.204
Hey, hey, come on.

54:27.237 --> 54:28.838
It's not a footstool.

54:28.871 --> 54:31.341
Well now it appears it's
gonna be here for a while.

54:31.375 --> 54:33.844
I might as well make it useful.

54:33.876 --> 54:34.778
You don't know that.

54:34.811 --> 54:36.112
You got any numbers?

54:36.146 --> 54:38.849
- I'm figuring that out.
- Uh huh.

54:38.882 --> 54:40.385
Wait, turn that up.

54:42.385 --> 54:43.286
Turn the fucking thing up.

54:43.320 --> 54:44.422
I'm turning it up.

54:44.454 --> 54:46.157
Get on with it.

54:46.190 --> 54:48.759
Draws attention on
his final resting place

54:48.791 --> 54:50.293
here in Las Vegas.

54:50.327 --> 54:52.263
The family has offered
a substantial reward

54:52.295 --> 54:55.465
for the return of his body,
with no questions asked.

54:55.498 --> 54:57.834
If anyone has any information,

54:57.867 --> 54:59.936
please contact your
local police department

54:59.969 --> 55:02.105
or this television station.

55:02.139 --> 55:04.909
This is Sophia
Crawford reporting live

55:04.942 --> 55:08.244
from the now empty grave
of Charlie Chaplin.

55:14.384 --> 55:16.186
Goddard.

55:16.219 --> 55:16.887
What's up?

55:16.920 --> 55:17.788
Whatever you two got going on,

55:17.822 --> 55:19.023
I want you to hand
it off to Napaloni.

55:19.056 --> 55:22.827
I want all available hands on
deck for this Chaplin thing.

55:22.860 --> 55:23.760
I just got a
warrant for the diner,

55:23.795 --> 55:25.829
the one where the
lepers get their mail.

55:25.862 --> 55:27.263
Give it to Napaloni.

55:27.297 --> 55:30.101
This Chaplin thing is all
over the news world wide

55:30.134 --> 55:32.302
and the mayor wants
whoever's responsible caught.

55:32.335 --> 55:34.204
And whoever these clowns
are are gonna pay,

55:34.237 --> 55:36.773
and I want my division to
catch him, is that clear?

55:36.806 --> 55:38.208
- Loud and clear, sir.
- Yes, sir.

55:38.242 --> 55:41.446
Good, now go catch
some body snatchers, now.

55:43.280 --> 55:45.015
Back to you, Bob.

55:45.047 --> 55:45.715
Fuck.

55:45.748 --> 55:46.884
We should call that number.

55:46.916 --> 55:47.884
- No.
- We should check

55:47.918 --> 55:49.019
what the reward is.

55:49.052 --> 55:50.120
- No.
- Let's just see

55:50.152 --> 55:52.222
what the number is, this
could be a quick fix, Terry.

55:52.255 --> 55:54.090
- No.
- Why not?

55:54.123 --> 55:55.358
Feels like a trap to me.

55:55.391 --> 55:57.094
It's not a trap,
it's on the news.

55:57.126 --> 55:59.028
- So?
- So we know it's legit.

55:59.061 --> 55:59.962
Really?

55:59.996 --> 56:02.298
Orson Welles' War of
the World broadcast

56:02.331 --> 56:03.232
was on national news,

56:03.266 --> 56:05.368
and that was the biggest
fucking hoax ever.

56:05.402 --> 56:06.971
- But this isn't.
- How do you know?

56:07.003 --> 56:08.873
Because we have
the fucking body.

56:10.173 --> 56:11.275
Oh, yeah.

56:12.309 --> 56:14.778
Who the fuck is that?

56:14.811 --> 56:15.746
Who is it?

56:15.780 --> 56:17.882
Oh my
God, shut the fuck up.

56:17.914 --> 56:19.349
Why, who is it?

56:19.382 --> 56:22.218
Terry, I
can hear you in there.

56:22.251 --> 56:23.286
Stapleton.

56:23.320 --> 56:25.256
Stapleton, let it in.

56:40.737 --> 56:43.373
- Have you got $750?
- For what?

56:43.407 --> 56:45.543
I still haven't paid the rent.

56:45.576 --> 56:46.876
Coming.

56:46.909 --> 56:48.078
You haven't?

56:50.414 --> 56:52.116
- Stapleton.
- Cal.

56:52.148 --> 56:54.851
How the devil are you?

56:54.885 --> 56:57.822
Oh, I'm blessed with good
health, as is my family.

56:57.855 --> 56:59.824
Terry, I trust you are well?

56:59.856 --> 57:01.525
Any better,
there'd be six of me.

57:03.427 --> 57:05.396
Any better, there'd
be six of you.

57:05.429 --> 57:06.564
I like that one.

57:09.233 --> 57:10.901
Where's my rent?

57:10.934 --> 57:12.236
Uh, well you see.

57:12.268 --> 57:14.304
I see you have money
for new furniture.

57:14.338 --> 57:15.439
No, no, it's just a coffin,

57:15.472 --> 57:18.375
coffee table from
the thrift store.

57:18.407 --> 57:21.578
Hey, how much was
it again we owed you?

57:21.612 --> 57:25.449
750 for this month
plus 750 for last month.

57:25.481 --> 57:27.617
Right, we've been working
so hard earning all that money

57:27.650 --> 57:29.886
that we're gonna give
it to you tomorrow.

57:29.920 --> 57:30.521
You will?

57:30.554 --> 57:31.555
We will?

57:31.588 --> 57:34.291
We will, yes, absolutely.

57:34.324 --> 57:37.027
Okay, well then I'll be
by in the morning, then.

57:37.059 --> 57:39.195
Oh, afternoon, actually,
which is slightly better for us.

57:39.228 --> 57:41.364
- Evening, actually.
- Early evening?

57:41.398 --> 57:44.168
- Watch the step, though.
- Cal, no, morning.

57:47.371 --> 57:50.273
Great, and just how are
we gonna have 1500 bucks

57:50.306 --> 57:51.407
by tomorrow afternoon?

57:51.442 --> 57:53.409
I have no idea, but I
figured the immediate problem

57:53.443 --> 57:54.277
was to get her out of here

57:54.311 --> 57:56.280
because she kept
looking at the coffin.

57:56.313 --> 57:58.115
Paying the rent is
tomorrow's problem.

57:58.148 --> 57:59.283
Yeah, but what are we gonna,

57:59.315 --> 58:01.284
oh, it's the leprosy money.

58:01.318 --> 58:03.320
It's almost five grand now.

58:03.353 --> 58:04.288
Terry, Terry, no.

58:04.320 --> 58:06.923
There is no safe way
to access that money.

58:07.590 --> 58:09.259
Well, I don't
want to be homeless.

58:09.293 --> 58:11.394
And I don't want to call
a five by eight cell home

58:11.427 --> 58:13.163
for the next 10 years.

58:13.195 --> 58:14.498
Well, what are
we gonna do then?

58:14.530 --> 58:16.166
I don't know.

58:21.038 --> 58:23.373
Hello Bruce, hello Bloom.

58:23.407 --> 58:26.343
No, no, no.

58:26.376 --> 58:27.611
Terry, they're just plants.

58:27.643 --> 58:28.978
They're my plants.

58:29.012 --> 58:30.314
Which you grew to sell.

58:30.347 --> 58:31.348
That was before.

58:31.380 --> 58:32.516
We need the money.

58:32.548 --> 58:34.050
Stop making it weird.

58:34.083 --> 58:35.085
It's not weird.

58:35.117 --> 58:36.987
- Yes it is.
- No it's not.

58:37.019 --> 58:38.956
It's a genuine
scientific condition.

58:38.989 --> 58:40.624
There's a genuine term for it.

58:40.657 --> 58:42.159
No there isn't, what is it?

58:42.192 --> 58:43.260
Paraphilia.

58:43.293 --> 58:43.927
Paraphilia?

58:43.960 --> 58:45.161
I never heard of paraphilia.

58:45.195 --> 58:47.463
It sounds like necrophilia,
where some guy fucks a corpse.

58:47.496 --> 58:48.665
Is that what you're
gonna do to the plants?

58:48.699 --> 58:50.401
You're gonna fuck
the plants, Terry?

58:50.434 --> 58:52.369
You're gonna upset them.

58:52.402 --> 58:53.369
Fuck you.

58:53.402 --> 58:54.605
Get a black bag.

59:16.659 --> 59:18.295
So, what do you got for me?

59:19.996 --> 59:21.264
Brought you something.

59:21.297 --> 59:24.434
Stills from a surveillance
camera at the cemetery

59:24.467 --> 59:26.469
where Charlie Chaplin's
body was stolen from.

59:26.503 --> 59:29.405
Somebody stole
Charlie Chaplin's body?

59:29.438 --> 59:30.540
It's all over the news.

59:30.574 --> 59:32.409
I don't watch
the fucking news.

59:32.442 --> 59:34.043
I know.

59:34.077 --> 59:36.447
So why would I
care about this?

59:36.480 --> 59:40.150
The official
reward is $100,000.

59:40.182 --> 59:42.385
The family, they're
willing to pay a lot more

59:42.418 --> 59:43.586
if this is settled quickly.

59:43.619 --> 59:45.088
Go on.

59:45.722 --> 59:48.726
They added the still from the
surveillance camera footage.

59:51.695 --> 59:52.630
What is that?

59:52.663 --> 59:55.032
It's a moving van,
Lloyd's Moving Company.

59:56.298 --> 59:58.168
Anybody else know about it?

59:58.201 --> 1:00:00.204
No one.

1:00:00.237 --> 1:00:01.072
Good.

1:00:02.106 --> 1:00:06.176
So I figured that's gotta
be worth at least 10 grand.

1:00:06.208 --> 1:00:10.047
10 fucking grand?

1:00:10.079 --> 1:00:11.681
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1:00:13.750 --> 1:00:15.485
How'd you come to that figure?

1:00:15.518 --> 1:00:18.788
10% of the minimum you're
gonna get out of this.

1:00:18.822 --> 1:00:20.289
Fair enough.

1:00:20.322 --> 1:00:22.225
I'll think about it.

1:00:24.126 --> 1:00:27.297
More important, what
about the Brits?

1:00:27.329 --> 1:00:28.798
I need something
more to go on.

1:00:28.831 --> 1:00:29.665
Dude, find them, all right?

1:00:29.699 --> 1:00:32.201
What the fuck are
we paying you for?

1:00:32.235 --> 1:00:33.637
You don't.

1:00:33.670 --> 1:00:35.306
Fuck off, fuck off.

1:00:43.313 --> 1:00:44.548
No ma'am, we're not looking

1:00:44.581 --> 1:00:46.383
for the ghost of
Charlie Chaplin.

1:00:46.416 --> 1:00:47.751
We're looking for
the actual body.

1:00:47.784 --> 1:00:50.320
Okay, thank you.

1:00:50.353 --> 1:00:51.822
You've had how
many calls so far?

1:00:51.855 --> 1:00:53.289
Over 17,000.

1:00:53.322 --> 1:00:54.357
17,000?

1:00:55.458 --> 1:00:56.259
Every whack job from here

1:00:56.293 --> 1:00:58.528
to Williams, Arizona
has a theory.

1:00:58.561 --> 1:01:00.663
That's what happens when
you put up 100 grand reward.

1:01:00.697 --> 1:01:03.367
I had no idea there were
so many psychics out there.

1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:06.070
- And nothing.
- A whole nothing burger.

1:01:08.170 --> 1:01:09.773
Vegas PD.

1:01:11.842 --> 1:01:14.110
We're sure this
is the right place?

1:01:14.143 --> 1:01:14.977
Positive.

1:01:15.012 --> 1:01:17.714
And where did we
get this contact?

1:01:17.746 --> 1:01:19.282
Facebook.

1:01:19.315 --> 1:01:22.285
- Facebook?
- Yeah.

1:01:22.318 --> 1:01:23.554
You set up a drug
deal on Facebook.

1:01:23.586 --> 1:01:25.188
Yeah.

1:01:25.222 --> 1:01:26.257
What could possibly go wrong?

1:01:26.289 --> 1:01:30.427
I belong to a holistic
healing group on Facebook.

1:01:30.460 --> 1:01:32.362
- Holistic healing?
- Yeah.

1:01:32.394 --> 1:01:35.498
You, with crystals
and candles and shit.

1:01:35.532 --> 1:01:36.633
Oh, fuck off.

1:01:36.666 --> 1:01:40.436
With like, meditation and
yoga and eating properly,

1:01:40.469 --> 1:01:41.605
that sort of shit.

1:01:41.637 --> 1:01:43.206
And this is you,
you belong to this.

1:01:43.239 --> 1:01:44.174
Why not?

1:01:44.208 --> 1:01:45.776
Because you're an
antisocial, alcoholic,

1:01:45.809 --> 1:01:47.544
violent sociopath, Terry.

1:01:47.577 --> 1:01:48.712
That's why not.

1:01:48.744 --> 1:01:51.514
If we all took a
more holistic approach

1:01:51.547 --> 1:01:55.751
to our daily routines, we would
all live in greater harmony.

1:01:55.784 --> 1:01:57.587
It's in the Tai Chi.

1:01:57.621 --> 1:01:59.256
- In the Tai Chi?
- Yeah.

1:01:59.289 --> 1:02:00.224
- You've read the Tai Chi?
- Uh huh.

1:02:00.257 --> 1:02:02.126
And how'd you do that
when you can't read?

1:02:02.159 --> 1:02:03.494
Was there pictures?

1:02:08.431 --> 1:02:09.833
Hi Terry.

1:02:09.865 --> 1:02:11.268
Nice to see you again.

1:02:11.300 --> 1:02:13.670
Namaste, Lakshmi.

1:02:13.702 --> 1:02:14.538
Likewise.

1:02:18.175 --> 1:02:19.276
Hello.

1:02:19.309 --> 1:02:20.777
You must be Cal.

1:02:20.809 --> 1:02:22.778
Cal, yes, that's me, even
though I thought we were gonna

1:02:22.811 --> 1:02:24.681
use fake names.

1:02:24.713 --> 1:02:26.650
Terry has told
us all about you.

1:02:26.682 --> 1:02:27.518
Well, that's good.

1:02:27.550 --> 1:02:28.585
Us, who's us?

1:02:28.617 --> 1:02:29.219
In the group.

1:02:29.251 --> 1:02:30.119
The group from Facebook,

1:02:30.152 --> 1:02:32.455
where we write down
what kind of crime

1:02:32.489 --> 1:02:34.525
we're about to commit, great.

1:02:34.557 --> 1:02:36.360
Please, leave the
bags on the bar.

1:02:37.494 --> 1:02:39.363
I assume it holds
the wondrous bounty

1:02:39.396 --> 1:02:41.398
that Terry has told us about.

1:02:41.431 --> 1:02:43.432
We took the liberty
of giving you a sample

1:02:43.465 --> 1:02:44.634
from our last batch.

1:02:44.666 --> 1:02:46.936
Don't fucking move or I'll
blow your fucking head off.

1:02:46.969 --> 1:02:50.473
Hey, hey, what the fuck
do you think you're doing?

1:02:50.507 --> 1:02:52.409
I don't know him, so I
brought a little friend of mine.

1:02:52.442 --> 1:02:53.911
But we're friends.

1:02:55.445 --> 1:02:56.480
On Facebook.

1:02:59.382 --> 1:03:01.518
Oh, he's serious?

1:03:01.550 --> 1:03:02.418
Yeah.

1:03:02.452 --> 1:03:04.588
Was he dropped on
his head as a kid?

1:03:04.621 --> 1:03:06.190
He probably should have been.

1:03:06.222 --> 1:03:09.460
Oh, both of you strip.

1:03:13.663 --> 1:03:14.731
I said strip.

1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:18.335
Now.

1:03:20.469 --> 1:03:21.337
And make it sexy.

1:03:24.407 --> 1:03:25.442
Dance for me.

1:03:40.824 --> 1:03:41.659
Shake it.

1:03:50.532 --> 1:03:52.368
Oh, this is awkward.

1:03:54.271 --> 1:03:55.973
They're a gift from our mom.

1:03:57.507 --> 1:03:58.608
So are mine.

1:03:59.775 --> 1:04:00.810
I know that, Terry.

1:04:14.423 --> 1:04:16.793
All right, no wires.

1:04:16.826 --> 1:04:18.494
Let's get down to business.

1:04:21.398 --> 1:04:23.900
Oh, so you're not
trying to rip us off?

1:04:23.932 --> 1:04:26.436
Do I look like a
fucking criminal to you?

1:04:26.469 --> 1:04:28.572
No, no, I wouldn't say that.

1:04:30.539 --> 1:04:31.375
Good.

1:04:33.943 --> 1:04:35.646
And good kush,
just like you said?

1:04:36.278 --> 1:04:38.548
I told you, it's good shit.

1:04:42.052 --> 1:04:43.019
It is.

1:04:45.554 --> 1:04:48.424
Not worth what you're
asking for it, though.

1:04:49.291 --> 1:04:52.028
I'm the one that does the
deals between me and my brother.

1:04:52.061 --> 1:04:53.362
And I hear it.

1:04:53.396 --> 1:04:54.564
So if it's such good shit,

1:04:54.597 --> 1:04:56.600
how come it's not worth the
six grand we're asking for?

1:04:56.632 --> 1:04:58.467
Hey, you told me five.

1:04:58.501 --> 1:04:59.803
Not now, Terry.

1:04:59.835 --> 1:05:03.639
Market's saturated,
and besides, that

1:05:03.672 --> 1:05:07.343
cutting, weighing,
packaging and reselling.

1:05:07.376 --> 1:05:10.413
Why should I do all the work
and not get paid for it?

1:05:10.447 --> 1:05:12.516
And besides, you're
obviously desperate.

1:05:12.548 --> 1:05:14.951
And what makes you think
that we're desperate?

1:05:17.387 --> 1:05:18.155
Terry.

1:05:18.188 --> 1:05:19.222
He also posted
on Facebook group

1:05:19.255 --> 1:05:22.425
that he needed to offload
some pot, desperately.

1:05:26.429 --> 1:05:27.865
You didn't, did you?

1:05:34.771 --> 1:05:35.706
Five grand.

1:05:35.739 --> 1:05:37.708
It's take it or leave it, then.

1:05:37.740 --> 1:05:38.608
Fine.

1:05:38.641 --> 1:05:41.477
- No, wait.
- I thought we had a deal.

1:05:41.510 --> 1:05:44.748
We do, but not
for six or five.

1:05:44.780 --> 1:05:45.715
How much?

1:05:45.748 --> 1:05:46.549
Three.

1:05:46.583 --> 1:05:47.416
- Deal.
- No way.

1:05:47.449 --> 1:05:49.552
Terry.

1:05:49.585 --> 1:05:51.587
I like you, Terry.

1:05:51.621 --> 1:05:56.427
You have a gentle soul,
the aura of a Leo.

1:05:58.128 --> 1:05:59.630
I like you, too.

1:06:00.262 --> 1:06:03.567
I reckon that if you
and I met in another life,

1:06:03.599 --> 1:06:04.802
we'd be lovers.

1:06:05.768 --> 1:06:06.602
Fuck me.

1:06:07.637 --> 1:06:08.472
No, thanks.

1:06:12.007 --> 1:06:12.842
Three grand.

1:06:17.579 --> 1:06:18.414
Keep the ones.

1:06:25.487 --> 1:06:26.623
Stop, just stop.

1:06:44.173 --> 1:06:46.543
Hey, look at me.

1:06:48.510 --> 1:06:49.146
Look at me.

1:06:50.813 --> 1:06:53.850
So you are absolutely,
positively sure

1:06:54.751 --> 1:06:59.523
that you have no idea why
your van was in the cemetery

1:06:59.556 --> 1:07:01.191
the night that body
got stolen, huh?

1:07:01.224 --> 1:07:02.059
I told you.

1:07:04.561 --> 1:07:05.396
I have no idea.

1:07:06.230 --> 1:07:11.434
Look, this van had a
wrong odometer reading

1:07:11.467 --> 1:07:12.536
the next morning.

1:07:13.503 --> 1:07:15.138
There was mud in the van.

1:07:15.170 --> 1:07:16.439
Okay, that's all I know.

1:07:20.009 --> 1:07:20.844
I believe you.

1:07:25.949 --> 1:07:26.784
You do?

1:07:27.916 --> 1:07:28.751
I do.

1:07:39.528 --> 1:07:40.831
Let me go, then.

1:07:42.030 --> 1:07:43.599
That I cannot do.

1:07:45.201 --> 1:07:47.170
But you said you believe me.

1:07:47.202 --> 1:07:48.704
Yes, I do believe you,

1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:53.476
but there are two things.

1:07:53.510 --> 1:07:56.580
One, I have to make
sure I'm not wrong,

1:07:57.579 --> 1:08:02.619
and two, you've seen my face.

1:08:08.757 --> 1:08:10.660
These fucking things.

1:08:11.994 --> 1:08:14.697
Motherfucker, come on, baby.

1:08:22.872 --> 1:08:26.243
I'm not wrong, I'm not
wrong, and I won't talk.

1:08:26.275 --> 1:08:28.010
I swear I won't.

1:08:28.043 --> 1:08:29.813
I'm telling you
it's the coffin.

1:08:29.845 --> 1:08:31.881
I thought you said
it was a coffee table.

1:08:31.914 --> 1:08:34.251
No, that's what
they're using it for.

1:08:34.283 --> 1:08:35.184
And they're not goths?

1:08:35.217 --> 1:08:36.185
Goths?

1:08:36.219 --> 1:08:37.253
Yes, goths.

1:08:37.287 --> 1:08:39.990
- You mean like Germans?
- Germans?

1:08:40.023 --> 1:08:41.557
Like Visigoths.

1:08:41.591 --> 1:08:43.627
No, goths, like Nic Cage.

1:08:43.659 --> 1:08:45.528
They're English, not German.

1:08:45.561 --> 1:08:46.863
There's English goths.

1:08:46.895 --> 1:08:48.664
Can we just get
back to the coffin?

1:08:48.698 --> 1:08:49.798
By all means.

1:08:49.832 --> 1:08:51.935
What if Charlie,

1:08:56.238 --> 1:09:00.543
the missing dead silent
comedian is in that apartment?

1:09:00.577 --> 1:09:02.279
Then we call the hotline
and collect the reward.

1:09:02.311 --> 1:09:04.680
First we take
possession of the coffin

1:09:04.713 --> 1:09:06.917
to be able to collect
the fucking reward.

1:09:06.949 --> 1:09:07.850
Then we break in.

1:09:07.884 --> 1:09:09.286
I have a pry bar.

1:09:09.319 --> 1:09:11.888
I have a key, I own the place.

1:09:11.921 --> 1:09:13.090
Even better.

1:09:15.257 --> 1:09:16.292
So with
everyone plotting

1:09:16.326 --> 1:09:19.229
to steal the precious
cargo or kill them for it,

1:09:19.261 --> 1:09:21.831
the boys hit upon
an ingenious idea.

1:09:21.863 --> 1:09:23.832
Simply take the body
back and rebury it

1:09:23.865 --> 1:09:26.802
and pretend it never happened.

1:09:26.836 --> 1:09:28.305
And like the true
geniuses they really are,

1:09:28.337 --> 1:09:31.307
they decided to retrace
some dangerous steps,

1:09:31.341 --> 1:09:32.910
because they are morons.

1:09:41.650 --> 1:09:42.751
Terry.

1:09:42.784 --> 1:09:43.819
What?

1:09:43.853 --> 1:09:44.954
The door's unlocked.

1:09:46.989 --> 1:09:47.890
Shut up.

1:09:52.295 --> 1:09:54.764
What the fuck?

1:09:54.796 --> 1:09:55.665
Whoa.

1:10:03.105 --> 1:10:05.608
That is messed up.

1:10:08.277 --> 1:10:09.346
He's got no ears.

1:10:11.381 --> 1:10:13.115
Do you think he's a leper?

1:10:13.149 --> 1:10:18.155
That
was in poor taste.

1:10:18.387 --> 1:10:19.189
Yeah, but it's funny.

1:10:19.221 --> 1:10:21.625
It was funny, but
we need to start

1:10:21.658 --> 1:10:23.126
being a bit more
respectful, you know?

1:10:23.158 --> 1:10:24.159
Why, we didn't do this.

1:10:24.194 --> 1:10:26.396
No, but we've done
other stuff in poor taste.

1:10:26.429 --> 1:10:28.898
What, like defiling a grave?

1:10:28.930 --> 1:10:31.134
Didn't defile a grave,
we desecrated a grave.

1:10:31.167 --> 1:10:32.068
What's the difference?

1:10:32.101 --> 1:10:35.204
Well, defile is a
bit more, you know.

1:10:36.405 --> 1:10:37.239
Like intimate.

1:10:38.373 --> 1:10:40.242
You defile that waitress yet?

1:10:40.275 --> 1:10:44.213
Oh, no, and stop.

1:10:44.247 --> 1:10:45.649
You know they fired her.

1:10:48.117 --> 1:10:49.619
All right, we gotta focus.

1:10:50.319 --> 1:10:52.154
I wonder what idiot did this.

1:10:52.188 --> 1:10:53.823
Don't know, don't care.

1:10:53.855 --> 1:10:54.724
They're not here now.

1:10:54.756 --> 1:10:56.058
Let's just get on with it.

1:10:56.091 --> 1:10:57.826
Yeah, all right.

1:10:57.859 --> 1:10:58.694
Hold on.

1:11:00.162 --> 1:11:02.731
You don't think this has
anything to do with us, do you?

1:11:02.765 --> 1:11:04.034
No, why would it be?

1:11:04.833 --> 1:11:06.769
You don't think it's
a bit of a coincidence?

1:11:06.802 --> 1:11:07.970
Not really.

1:11:08.003 --> 1:11:09.271
Terry, are you serious?

1:11:09.305 --> 1:11:10.707
We took his van to steal

1:11:10.739 --> 1:11:12.274
the most famous person
in the world's body

1:11:12.307 --> 1:11:15.310
and then 24 hours later

1:11:15.344 --> 1:11:17.980
after the world's gone
crazy with this news

1:11:18.014 --> 1:11:19.682
and we've turned into the
biggest Easter egg hunt

1:11:19.716 --> 1:11:22.819
in the world, he winds
up dead and tortured.

1:11:22.851 --> 1:11:24.354
You don't think
it's coincidental?

1:11:25.387 --> 1:11:28.024
Nah, very violent city.

1:11:28.056 --> 1:11:30.126
- Well, that's true.
- Violent country.

1:11:30.158 --> 1:11:32.228
I can see that
Terry, but still.

1:11:32.261 --> 1:11:34.164
This wouldn't ever
happen in the rainforest.

1:11:34.197 --> 1:11:36.699
Well, what?

1:11:36.733 --> 1:11:38.335
It's very peaceful there.

1:11:39.801 --> 1:11:41.904
I was thinking of going
on a yoga retreat.

1:11:43.338 --> 1:11:46.009
- I'm leaving.
- No, don't be stupid.

1:11:46.042 --> 1:11:47.043
What?

1:11:47.076 --> 1:11:48.278
We still need the keys.

1:11:48.310 --> 1:11:51.113
Now don't be a Jessie,
just go and get them.

1:11:51.146 --> 1:11:52.716
I'm not putting my
hand in his pocket.

1:11:52.748 --> 1:11:54.250
Oh, you sissy.

1:11:54.283 --> 1:11:55.252
Oh my God.

1:11:59.255 --> 1:12:01.257
It's okay mate, I'm
just borrowing it.

1:12:02.057 --> 1:12:04.961
I forgot, he can't
hear me, can he?

1:12:04.993 --> 1:12:08.363
That, that was in poor taste.

1:12:08.396 --> 1:12:09.364
Funny though.

1:12:09.398 --> 1:12:12.868
It was funny, but that
doesn't make it okay.

1:12:23.912 --> 1:12:25.380
It's gone!

1:12:25.413 --> 1:12:27.082
What do you mean, it's gone?

1:12:27.115 --> 1:12:28.251
Gone where?

1:12:28.283 --> 1:12:29.952
Well how the hell
do I know where?

1:12:29.985 --> 1:12:32.154
It's just gone.

1:12:32.854 --> 1:12:36.492
Those bastards must have
turned it in for my reward.

1:12:38.094 --> 1:12:41.297
- Their reward?
- What?

1:12:41.329 --> 1:12:42.465
They had it first,

1:12:42.497 --> 1:12:44.934
then surely it's their reward.

1:12:46.168 --> 1:12:48.872
If they stole it
in the first place,

1:12:48.904 --> 1:12:52.007
they don't deserve
the fucking reward.

1:12:52.041 --> 1:12:53.744
Surely they
deserve it the most.

1:12:55.177 --> 1:12:57.213
Just shut up.

1:13:05.921 --> 1:13:07.890
It's about
Charlie Chaplin.

1:13:07.923 --> 1:13:09.359
What about it?

1:13:09.391 --> 1:13:11.360
It's a terrible
thing they did.

1:13:11.394 --> 1:13:12.395
Yes it is.

1:13:12.427 --> 1:13:13.528
Listen, I'm awfully busy.

1:13:13.563 --> 1:13:15.398
If you know something, there's
a hotline you can call.

1:13:15.430 --> 1:13:16.365
I know who did it.

1:13:16.399 --> 1:13:17.901
You do?

1:13:17.934 --> 1:13:20.970
- No, you don't.
- Of course I do.

1:13:21.002 --> 1:13:21.636
Like I said.

1:13:21.671 --> 1:13:23.539
They were from Liverpool.

1:13:23.573 --> 1:13:25.008
Liverpool, England?

1:13:25.041 --> 1:13:27.243
They sounded like
the Beatles to me.

1:13:27.275 --> 1:13:29.179
They don't play
tennis in Liverpool.

1:13:29.212 --> 1:13:30.346
I'm sure they do.

1:13:30.378 --> 1:13:31.347
No, it's Wembley.

1:13:33.515 --> 1:13:34.116
Wimbledon?

1:13:34.149 --> 1:13:36.251
No, definitely Wembley.

1:13:36.284 --> 1:13:37.820
Well, like I said.

1:13:37.854 --> 1:13:38.521
There's a hotline you can call.

1:13:38.554 --> 1:13:40.157
I'm a little busy right now.

1:13:42.625 --> 1:13:44.394
We could certainly
use the money.

1:13:51.199 --> 1:13:53.302
What are we gonna do now?

1:13:53.336 --> 1:13:54.904
Fucked if I know.

1:13:54.936 --> 1:13:56.305
We could just dump it.

1:13:56.338 --> 1:13:57.907
No, that wouldn't be right.

1:13:57.939 --> 1:13:59.074
Why?

1:13:59.108 --> 1:14:00.844
Well, because it would be
sacrilegious or something.

1:14:00.877 --> 1:14:02.412
And digging him up wasn't?

1:14:02.444 --> 1:14:06.048
Well yeah, but two wrongs
don't make a right, Terry.

1:14:06.082 --> 1:14:07.150
Well then?

1:14:07.182 --> 1:14:08.417
The whole point of trying
to bring him back here

1:14:08.451 --> 1:14:10.019
was to diffuse the situation,

1:14:10.051 --> 1:14:12.087
you know, to calm
everybody down.

1:14:12.121 --> 1:14:13.389
If we just ditch him
on a street corner

1:14:13.421 --> 1:14:15.224
like some random snot rag,

1:14:15.257 --> 1:14:17.394
everybody's gonna be
demanding our blood again.

1:14:18.927 --> 1:14:20.529
We need another plan.

1:14:20.563 --> 1:14:21.398
Like what?

1:14:23.231 --> 1:14:24.600
We could take him
back to the apartment.

1:14:24.634 --> 1:14:25.935
I need a drink.

1:14:32.541 --> 1:14:35.979
Terry, it's a one-time big
effort for a massive payday.

1:14:36.011 --> 1:14:40.349
Wait, I swear I heard
them words somewhere before.

1:14:40.382 --> 1:14:41.617
- Just keep moving.
- I am.

1:14:42.585 --> 1:14:44.988
Here we go, here we go, yeah.

1:14:49.492 --> 1:14:51.394
- Oh bugger.
- What?

1:14:51.426 --> 1:14:53.395
I forgot the keys.

1:14:53.429 --> 1:14:54.329
Again?

1:14:54.363 --> 1:14:55.365
You forgot them last time.

1:14:55.398 --> 1:14:57.432
Come on, we'll just ram it.

1:14:57.466 --> 1:14:58.902
All right, let's go.

1:15:00.302 --> 1:15:02.372
Oh, it's open, that was
a bit of luck, wasn't it?

1:15:02.404 --> 1:15:03.639
That's handy.

1:15:06.242 --> 1:15:07.577
Police!

1:15:21.023 --> 1:15:23.293
Call an
ambulance and forensics.

1:15:23.326 --> 1:15:24.360
Yes, ma'am.

1:15:28.663 --> 1:15:30.300
This is Detective Bennet.

1:15:30.332 --> 1:15:33.435
I need an ambulance
at 2310 Sunset Road.

1:15:33.469 --> 1:15:34.304
Hey Bennet.

1:15:35.171 --> 1:15:37.606
Get me the footage
from this CCTV camera.

1:15:39.207 --> 1:15:42.277
Oh ho ho, see you later, bro.

1:15:42.310 --> 1:15:43.412
Where are you going?

1:15:43.445 --> 1:15:44.346
I have a date.

1:15:44.380 --> 1:15:45.280
Don't wait up.

1:15:45.314 --> 1:15:46.316
What about him?

1:15:46.349 --> 1:15:47.583
Well, he's asleep already.

1:15:47.615 --> 1:15:49.685
That's not what I meant.

1:15:49.719 --> 1:15:51.386
He's not going
anywhere, is he?

1:15:51.420 --> 1:15:53.088
Look, I'll deal with
it when I get home.

1:15:53.122 --> 1:15:54.257
We will, you mean.

1:15:54.289 --> 1:15:55.158
What?

1:15:55.190 --> 1:15:57.193
Well, it's always
the same with you.

1:15:57.225 --> 1:16:00.063
It's always I 'til
you want something.

1:16:02.631 --> 1:16:05.268
We have to figure something out.

1:16:05.301 --> 1:16:07.303
We will, brother.

1:16:07.336 --> 1:16:09.271
Okay, just give me a few hours
just to be a human being.

1:16:09.305 --> 1:16:12.008
I just need a little
stress relief.

1:16:12.041 --> 1:16:14.277
That's what the kids are
calling it nowadays, are they?

1:16:14.310 --> 1:16:16.212
For God's sake, bear in mind

1:16:16.244 --> 1:16:17.713
my only source of stress is you.

1:16:17.747 --> 1:16:21.184
I love you, but it's you,
so just give me a few hours

1:16:21.216 --> 1:16:22.184
to be a human being,
and you know what?

1:16:22.217 --> 1:16:25.188
Meditate, do yoga, do
whatever it is you do

1:16:25.220 --> 1:16:26.355
to relieve yourself of stress,

1:16:26.389 --> 1:16:27.556
and then we'll figure him out.

1:16:27.590 --> 1:16:29.391
But pay the rent.

1:16:29.425 --> 1:16:30.460
She's coming.

1:16:32.395 --> 1:16:33.496
All right, well it's there.

1:16:33.529 --> 1:16:34.664
Try not to sleep with her.

1:16:34.697 --> 1:16:35.532
Be good.

1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:52.682
This better be good.

1:16:52.715 --> 1:16:54.484
I could have gotten laid.

1:16:54.516 --> 1:16:55.385
- It is.
- Good.

1:16:55.417 --> 1:16:57.353
What do you got?

1:16:57.386 --> 1:17:00.423
That moving van,
the one from Lloyd's?

1:17:00.456 --> 1:17:01.289
Yeah, what about it?

1:17:01.323 --> 1:17:03.291
Did you have to
burn his ears off?

1:17:03.324 --> 1:17:05.260
Hey, I had to be sure.

1:17:05.293 --> 1:17:06.162
Both of them?

1:17:06.194 --> 1:17:08.363
It took both ears
for me to be sure.

1:17:08.396 --> 1:17:10.298
Poor son of a bitch.

1:17:10.332 --> 1:17:11.801
Turned out he didn't
know anything.

1:17:11.833 --> 1:17:13.068
Doesn't now.

1:17:13.101 --> 1:17:14.503
Well, that's a given.

1:17:15.604 --> 1:17:18.074
So what about this van?

1:17:18.106 --> 1:17:21.577
CCTV footage, two
blocks from the cemetery.

1:17:22.778 --> 1:17:24.447
- Got a clear shot.
- Great.

1:17:25.113 --> 1:17:27.016
Passenger's face.

1:17:28.551 --> 1:17:30.253
Creepy looking motherfucker.

1:17:32.154 --> 1:17:35.058
Hmm, you got an ID on this guy?

1:17:35.091 --> 1:17:36.826
Sure do, he's
a convicted felon

1:17:36.859 --> 1:17:39.462
by the name of Terry Deacon.

1:17:39.494 --> 1:17:41.430
D, Terry D, Terry D.

1:17:42.530 --> 1:17:43.632
You know him?

1:17:43.666 --> 1:17:45.301
No, I don't think so.

1:17:45.333 --> 1:17:47.103
You got an address, right?

1:17:47.136 --> 1:17:49.238
- You're gonna love this.
- What?

1:17:49.270 --> 1:17:50.505
He's got a brother.

1:17:50.538 --> 1:17:53.076
So what, I got
a fucking brother.

1:17:53.109 --> 1:17:54.310
British brother.

1:17:54.342 --> 1:17:57.380
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:17:57.412 --> 1:17:58.713
These are the two Brits?

1:17:58.747 --> 1:17:59.582
This guy's?

1:18:01.283 --> 1:18:02.852
So this address.

1:18:02.885 --> 1:18:05.755
Hey, you want to
make some real money?

1:18:05.787 --> 1:18:07.322
Of course I do.

1:18:07.355 --> 1:18:09.257
You've gotta get rid
of Hynkel, all right?

1:18:09.291 --> 1:18:10.293
We gotta get rid of him.

1:18:10.326 --> 1:18:12.427
Whoa, I'm not
condoning murder.

1:18:12.461 --> 1:18:13.396
I'm not saying murder.

1:18:13.429 --> 1:18:16.099
Look, you're a cop,
he's a scumbag criminal.

1:18:16.131 --> 1:18:19.134
You figure out a way to set
him up, we get him put away.

1:18:21.804 --> 1:18:23.739
I got just the thing.

1:18:23.771 --> 1:18:24.606
What?

1:18:25.573 --> 1:18:26.408
Bait.

1:18:32.881 --> 1:18:34.750
Terry, come on, I
know you're in there.

1:18:34.783 --> 1:18:36.552
I saw Cal in the
parking lot and he said,

1:18:36.585 --> 1:18:38.287
- Stapleton.
- Terry.

1:18:38.319 --> 1:18:39.421
How's it going?

1:18:39.454 --> 1:18:40.389
Good, you have my rent?

1:18:40.421 --> 1:18:42.591
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1:18:43.591 --> 1:18:45.594
Are you going out tonight?

1:18:45.627 --> 1:18:47.429
No, no, no.

1:18:47.462 --> 1:18:48.163
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

1:18:48.197 --> 1:18:49.699
The place is a
mess, all right?

1:18:49.731 --> 1:18:51.399
Come on Terry, come
on, we can have a drink.

1:18:51.432 --> 1:18:53.469
Maybe next month, all right?

1:18:53.502 --> 1:18:56.306
- All right Terry, thank you.
- Okay.

1:19:02.344 --> 1:19:04.480
You're late, pilgrim.

1:19:05.148 --> 1:19:06.916
I don't have a watch, sorry.

1:19:06.948 --> 1:19:08.884
That doesn't mean
you're not late.

1:19:08.917 --> 1:19:11.520
Yeah, okay, I'm late.

1:19:12.488 --> 1:19:13.523
Also, I don't have it.

1:19:13.555 --> 1:19:17.759
Wow, I do have more
than one bowling ball bag.

1:19:17.792 --> 1:19:19.528
Yet, I don't have it yet.

1:19:19.561 --> 1:19:20.395
I should have said that.

1:19:20.430 --> 1:19:23.466
You are playing
with fire, mister.

1:19:23.498 --> 1:19:26.202
I thought Brits
paid their debts.

1:19:26.234 --> 1:19:27.603
We do, we do, we really do.

1:19:28.270 --> 1:19:30.672
What would Mr. Churchill say?

1:19:31.372 --> 1:19:33.509
Well not very much, he's dead.

1:19:33.542 --> 1:19:35.778
Something your brother
will have in common

1:19:35.810 --> 1:19:39.581
with Mr. Churchill if you
don't stop your talking

1:19:39.614 --> 1:19:40.483
and start doing something.

1:19:40.515 --> 1:19:42.817
Okay, look, it's
coming, it's coming.

1:19:42.850 --> 1:19:43.551
Really?

1:19:43.585 --> 1:19:45.354
I would hardly
come to meet you

1:19:45.386 --> 1:19:46.922
if I was just gonna skip town.

1:19:48.224 --> 1:19:50.293
24 hours.

1:19:50.326 --> 1:19:51.493
All right, that's tight.

1:19:51.527 --> 1:19:55.198
So is the noose around
your neck, pilgrim.

1:20:06.408 --> 1:20:07.777
Let's see what we've got.

1:20:11.479 --> 1:20:13.215
Well hello again.

1:20:13.248 --> 1:20:14.349
You know him?

1:20:14.382 --> 1:20:15.318
I believe I do.

1:20:15.350 --> 1:20:16.752
Let's see what else we have.

1:20:18.587 --> 1:20:19.722
I recognize that car.

1:20:24.426 --> 1:20:27.764
Whoa, good evening, Father.

1:20:33.301 --> 1:20:34.336
You know them too?

1:20:34.369 --> 1:20:36.706
I do believe Christmas,
Easter and Thanksgiving

1:20:36.738 --> 1:20:38.440
came all on the
same day this year.

1:20:38.474 --> 1:20:40.409
Those are our Chaplain
boys and lepers,

1:20:40.442 --> 1:20:42.444
which means we know
exactly where they are.

1:20:42.478 --> 1:20:43.445
And where's that?

1:20:58.827 --> 1:21:00.329
No, thank you.

1:21:00.362 --> 1:21:01.430
What's your name?

1:21:01.462 --> 1:21:02.364
Janice.

1:21:02.398 --> 1:21:03.798
Hello, Janice.

1:21:03.832 --> 1:21:06.435
Is Helen back there or anything?

1:21:06.467 --> 1:21:07.869
- No.
- Is she coming in today?

1:21:07.903 --> 1:21:08.804
No.

1:21:08.837 --> 1:21:10.773
Do you know when
she's coming in again?

1:21:10.805 --> 1:21:12.407
No.

1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:13.275
Oh.

1:21:14.643 --> 1:21:16.346
You wanna hear the specials?

1:21:18.079 --> 1:21:18.914
No.

1:21:19.748 --> 1:21:22.717
Hey, do you happen
to know two customers

1:21:22.751 --> 1:21:25.421
with British accents
that come here a lot?

1:21:25.453 --> 1:21:26.322
Does that ring a bell?

1:21:26.354 --> 1:21:27.455
- No.
- You sure?

1:21:27.488 --> 1:21:28.523
Yeah.

1:21:30.458 --> 1:21:31.426
Thank you, Janice.

1:21:31.460 --> 1:21:33.563
You've been very helpful.

1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:53.483
You got something?

1:21:54.317 --> 1:21:58.787
Yeah, contact with
the British brothers.

1:22:00.488 --> 1:22:02.024
Bring them to me.

1:22:08.663 --> 1:22:09.731
The
silent movie star

1:22:09.765 --> 1:22:13.069
was rumored to be buried
with many personal effects,

1:22:13.101 --> 1:22:17.340
including his 1972
honorary gold-plated Oscar,

1:22:17.372 --> 1:22:21.576
which he received for a lifetime
of dedication to the arts.

1:22:22.243 --> 1:22:25.014
The body's whereabouts
are still unknown.

1:23:00.082 --> 1:23:01.517
Like, he's cute
and everything,

1:23:01.550 --> 1:23:05.154
but I've got myself to
think about, you know?

1:23:05.186 --> 1:23:06.087
I know.

1:23:06.122 --> 1:23:08.391
Like, he'd sell me
out in a heartbeat.

1:23:08.423 --> 1:23:09.192
Probably.

1:23:09.225 --> 1:23:10.493
Probably lie
his ass off to me.

1:23:10.525 --> 1:23:13.429
He just wants to get laid.

1:23:17.599 --> 1:23:18.900
Oh, no more for me.

1:23:20.101 --> 1:23:25.507
Actually, that's for
me, but I'd gladly buy you one.

1:23:25.707 --> 1:23:29.110
Oh my God, you're
Wayne Newton.

1:23:29.144 --> 1:23:31.146
Last time I checked.

1:23:31.180 --> 1:23:33.048
You drink here?

1:23:34.983 --> 1:23:37.485
Let's keep that our secret.

1:23:37.519 --> 1:23:38.521
Of course.

1:23:39.188 --> 1:23:41.423
Wow, I'm such a fan.

1:23:42.591 --> 1:23:43.559
Well, thank you.

1:23:43.591 --> 1:23:45.161
This is so unreal.

1:23:46.094 --> 1:23:46.929
Cheers.

1:23:48.963 --> 1:23:50.899
Can I ask you something?

1:23:50.932 --> 1:23:52.467
Sure, anything.

1:23:52.501 --> 1:23:54.069
Do you know Cal?

1:23:54.101 --> 1:23:58.474
Cal, you mean British Cal?

1:23:58.506 --> 1:23:59.474
Yeah, British Cal.

1:23:59.507 --> 1:24:01.443
- Yes I do.
- Why?

1:24:01.476 --> 1:24:02.644
Did he con you out of money?

1:24:02.677 --> 1:24:04.447
Oh my God, no, no.

1:24:04.479 --> 1:24:08.650
He's a small fish in a big pond.

1:24:09.417 --> 1:24:13.588
There's something
called fish love.

1:24:14.890 --> 1:24:16.926
Oh shit.

1:24:16.958 --> 1:24:18.092
What?

1:24:18.126 --> 1:24:19.628
You really do know him.

1:24:19.661 --> 1:24:21.230
Yes, I really do.

1:24:21.262 --> 1:24:24.199
- Oh no.
- What?

1:24:24.233 --> 1:24:25.801
I messed up.

1:24:25.833 --> 1:24:27.802
Well, he's not a bad guy.

1:24:27.836 --> 1:24:29.572
What should I do?

1:24:31.206 --> 1:24:33.443
Go make it right.

1:24:40.282 --> 1:24:41.117
Thank you.

1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:58.835
Hey.

1:24:59.702 --> 1:25:01.537
There's something
I have to tell you.

1:25:01.569 --> 1:25:02.604
Is it how handsome I am?

1:25:02.637 --> 1:25:04.273
Shut up, I'm serious.

1:25:04.305 --> 1:25:06.475
I was being serious too.

1:25:07.208 --> 1:25:08.277
There's a guy at the diner

1:25:08.310 --> 1:25:10.279
looking for you
and your brother.

1:25:10.311 --> 1:25:13.815
I took his money to rat you
out, but I couldn't do it.

1:25:14.882 --> 1:25:15.850
I'm sorry.

1:25:15.884 --> 1:25:17.953
That's okay, I think
I can guess who he is.

1:25:17.985 --> 1:25:19.555
You're not mad?

1:25:19.587 --> 1:25:21.657
No, no, no.

1:25:21.689 --> 1:25:23.658
It's not your fault, you
didn't borrow the money.

1:25:23.692 --> 1:25:26.194
Don't read into this
more than you should.

1:25:26.228 --> 1:25:27.229
I won't.

1:25:27.261 --> 1:25:28.898
I shouldn't have lied.

1:25:28.930 --> 1:25:31.199
Well, in the spirit
of sharing things,

1:25:31.233 --> 1:25:34.570
I guess I should
tell you something.

1:25:34.603 --> 1:25:35.238
Oh?

1:25:36.171 --> 1:25:39.007
Me and Terry have a dead
body hidden at the apartment.

1:25:39.041 --> 1:25:40.074
Whose?

1:25:40.108 --> 1:25:41.644
It's a really long story.

1:25:41.676 --> 1:25:45.179
Well, as long as it's
not Charlie Chaplin.

1:25:45.212 --> 1:25:47.782
Yeah, as long as it's not him.

1:25:49.885 --> 1:25:51.186
Holy shit.

1:25:53.020 --> 1:25:55.291
Fucking pig, I told you
not to fucking touch me.

1:25:59.595 --> 1:26:01.197
What the hell's going on here?

1:26:02.597 --> 1:26:04.632
She's drunk, ran a red light,

1:26:04.666 --> 1:26:06.135
has a trunk full of marijuana,

1:26:06.167 --> 1:26:08.570
no driver's license,
no insurance

1:26:08.604 --> 1:26:10.072
and the vehicle
registration shows the car

1:26:10.104 --> 1:26:11.773
is actually owned by you.

1:26:12.707 --> 1:26:13.675
Police brutality!

1:26:14.842 --> 1:26:16.211
Thanks, I'll
take it from here.

1:26:16.243 --> 1:26:18.313
I can't do that.

1:26:18.346 --> 1:26:19.782
Sure you can.

1:26:19.814 --> 1:26:20.615
Nope.

1:26:20.649 --> 1:26:22.084
Don't be such a dick.

1:26:22.117 --> 1:26:23.786
It was a one time
thing, I was drunk.

1:26:23.819 --> 1:26:25.788
And you never returned
one of my phone calls.

1:26:25.820 --> 1:26:26.956
That hurt.

1:26:26.988 --> 1:26:29.324
I'm not even drunk, I only
had three bottles of wine.

1:26:30.826 --> 1:26:31.793
Really, you want
to do this now?

1:26:31.827 --> 1:26:34.195
No, what I want to do
is what we did before.

1:26:34.229 --> 1:26:35.130
Here, now?

1:26:35.163 --> 1:26:38.233
No, how about tomorrow
night, same place?

1:26:39.801 --> 1:26:42.204
Fine, but this
is the last time.

1:26:42.237 --> 1:26:44.006
Done.

1:26:44.038 --> 1:26:45.140
Get these off of me.

1:26:51.712 --> 1:26:52.747
See you tomorrow.

1:26:55.317 --> 1:26:56.351
Asshole!

1:27:00.122 --> 1:27:01.591
Can you believe this guy?

1:27:03.824 --> 1:27:06.161
Are you really gonna sleep
with that jerk for me?

1:27:06.194 --> 1:27:08.664
No, I'm gonna sleep
with him for me.

1:27:08.697 --> 1:27:09.798
He was great in bed.

1:27:10.931 --> 1:27:12.300
That's my sis.

1:27:14.269 --> 1:27:15.904
Why'd you ignore his calls then?

1:27:15.936 --> 1:27:17.840
Because he's so fucking needy.

1:27:17.872 --> 1:27:19.340
Fucking men.

1:27:19.373 --> 1:27:22.377
You know what, if I'd know
that all you needed to get laid

1:27:22.411 --> 1:27:24.313
was me getting arrested, I mean,

1:27:24.345 --> 1:27:26.314
I would have done
that shit ages ago.

1:27:26.347 --> 1:27:27.815
Just get in.

1:27:27.849 --> 1:27:29.251
- I'll drive.
- No, you're not.

1:27:52.707 --> 1:27:56.277
Terry, Terry my good
friend, I'm coming in.

1:27:57.479 --> 1:28:01.383
Terry, I need to
check the fuse boxes.

1:28:01.416 --> 1:28:03.217
Are you here?

1:28:03.251 --> 1:28:04.320
Drunk asshole's gone.

1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:14.896
See, I told you it's back.

1:28:14.930 --> 1:28:16.432
I didn't doubt
you for a minute.

1:28:17.432 --> 1:28:21.470
You said my delusions were
bigger than my cup size.

1:28:21.502 --> 1:28:25.306
You said you'd only agree to
come so you could prove it.

1:28:25.340 --> 1:28:26.442
No, no, no.

1:28:33.247 --> 1:28:36.784
Christ, I'm gonna get high
just driving this thing.

1:28:36.818 --> 1:28:39.221
Yeah, sorry, the
bag must have split.

1:28:42.823 --> 1:28:44.192
Where are we going, anyway?

1:28:44.225 --> 1:28:46.862
I'm taking you to my
place to sleep it off,

1:28:46.895 --> 1:28:49.331
but first I have to
make a quick stop.

1:28:49.363 --> 1:28:50.265
It's a work thing.

1:28:51.399 --> 1:28:52.735
Yeah, no worries.

1:28:52.768 --> 1:28:53.435
Walk it away.

1:29:01.275 --> 1:29:02.778
Jesus Christ Terry, stop.

1:29:02.810 --> 1:29:04.412
What the hell are you doing?

1:29:04.445 --> 1:29:06.314
Oh my God, you weren't lying.

1:29:06.347 --> 1:29:07.983
I told you I was
telling the truth.

1:29:08.015 --> 1:29:09.283
I'm opening it up.

1:29:09.317 --> 1:29:11.386
Why, why, why
would you do that?

1:29:11.418 --> 1:29:13.354
'Cause he was
buried with his Oscar.

1:29:13.387 --> 1:29:15.757
- So?
- So we could sell it.

1:29:15.791 --> 1:29:17.391
How Terry, how are
we gonna do that?

1:29:17.425 --> 1:29:19.862
God, I wish you were lying.

1:29:19.895 --> 1:29:20.696
How what?

1:29:20.729 --> 1:29:21.564
How are you gonna
explain the fact

1:29:21.596 --> 1:29:23.998
that you have Charlie
Chaplin's Oscar?

1:29:24.032 --> 1:29:25.100
Or mentally ill,

1:29:25.132 --> 1:29:26.300
or something that would
make a decent legal defense.

1:29:26.333 --> 1:29:28.002
Whatever you're doing, stop.

1:29:28.036 --> 1:29:29.037
Give me that.

1:29:29.069 --> 1:29:30.538
Are you two?

1:29:30.572 --> 1:29:34.275
No, no, she's
helping us, okay?

1:29:34.309 --> 1:29:35.409
Why?

1:29:35.443 --> 1:29:36.912
I don't know.

1:29:38.814 --> 1:29:42.251
Listen Cal, there's
something else.

1:29:44.219 --> 1:29:45.887
I made a bit of a mess.

1:29:45.921 --> 1:29:47.289
It's in the bathroom.

1:29:47.322 --> 1:29:49.324
In the bathroom I've
made a bit of a mess.

1:29:49.356 --> 1:29:53.261
Terry, I'll help you clean
it up afterwards, okay?

1:29:53.295 --> 1:29:55.898
Can you give me a minute
to explain everything else?

1:29:58.500 --> 1:30:00.202
I'll be right in.

1:30:01.136 --> 1:30:03.873
I told you he's not a bad guy.

1:30:14.515 --> 1:30:16.284
Look, I can explain.

1:30:18.286 --> 1:30:20.221
Okay, I can explain everything.

1:30:20.255 --> 1:30:21.390
What the fuck?

1:30:21.422 --> 1:30:23.157
What's wrong with you two?

1:30:23.190 --> 1:30:25.260
It seemed like a win-win,
you have to understand that.

1:30:25.292 --> 1:30:27.362
Tell me it is
your brother's idea.

1:30:27.395 --> 1:30:28.463
It was.

1:30:28.496 --> 1:30:30.899
Well that makes you an
idiot and him a super idiot.

1:30:30.931 --> 1:30:31.867
Okay, so he's an idiot.

1:30:31.899 --> 1:30:34.402
He's a super idiot,
he's a fucking moron,

1:30:34.435 --> 1:30:36.971
and I've been cleaning
up for him forever.

1:30:37.005 --> 1:30:40.242
It's fucking like
babysitting 24/7.

1:30:40.274 --> 1:30:41.509
Wait, Terry, Terry!

1:30:42.444 --> 1:30:43.279
Shit.

1:30:44.279 --> 1:30:45.480
But he's my brother, okay?

1:30:45.514 --> 1:30:49.418
He's family and I love him, and
you'd do the same for yours.

1:30:49.451 --> 1:30:52.386
Every cop, trooper and
FBI agent in the state

1:30:52.420 --> 1:30:53.823
are looking for you two.

1:30:55.489 --> 1:30:56.457
Terry!

1:31:13.541 --> 1:31:14.443
I'll have a tea.

1:31:18.313 --> 1:31:20.481
Make it English Breakfast.

1:31:33.494 --> 1:31:36.998
Janice, I'll take a tea also.

1:31:37.966 --> 1:31:40.236
My pal here will pay for it.

1:31:41.069 --> 1:31:43.272
Who the fuck are you?

1:31:43.305 --> 1:31:45.340
I'm the fuck that
you owe 30 grand to,

1:31:45.372 --> 1:31:46.942
that's who the fuck I am.

1:31:46.975 --> 1:31:50.279
- Get ready.
- Yeah, they never do.

1:31:51.046 --> 1:31:53.382
I'm telling you something,
for your well being,

1:31:53.414 --> 1:31:58.186
we're gonna work this out
right here and right now, okay?

1:32:01.456 --> 1:32:03.225
Any food?

1:32:03.257 --> 1:32:04.092
Food?

1:32:05.193 --> 1:32:06.595
No Janice, no food for me.

1:32:07.962 --> 1:32:11.132
How about you, have
any last requests?

1:32:14.069 --> 1:32:16.405
No, I'm fine.

1:32:19.073 --> 1:32:22.310
- Look, I can explain.
- I figured

1:32:22.344 --> 1:32:26.314
that the aforementioned
30 grand is not available,

1:32:28.149 --> 1:32:31.320
but why don't you just give
us Charlie Chaplin's body?

1:32:32.988 --> 1:32:35.257
What makes you
think I have it?

1:32:35.289 --> 1:32:37.192
I have my sources.

1:32:37.225 --> 1:32:39.061
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:32:39.094 --> 1:32:40.162
Yeah, well I think you do.

1:32:40.194 --> 1:32:44.265
You and your stupid fucking
brother stole that body,

1:32:44.298 --> 1:32:47.536
and I want to know where it is.

1:32:47.569 --> 1:32:49.271
If you think I'm
bringing any trouble

1:32:49.304 --> 1:32:51.105
to my brother's front doorstep,

1:32:51.773 --> 1:32:54.342
you don't know fuck
all about family.

1:32:58.380 --> 1:33:00.414
I know this
about family, okay?

1:33:00.448 --> 1:33:02.451
I will blow your fucking
kidney out your ass

1:33:02.484 --> 1:33:04.286
without thinking twice about it.

1:33:05.020 --> 1:33:09.057
Now I will take you and your
brother will come to get you,

1:33:09.090 --> 1:33:11.360
and he will bring the body.

1:33:11.393 --> 1:33:12.360
That's what I know about family.

1:33:12.394 --> 1:33:14.029
Now if you want to stay alive,

1:33:14.061 --> 1:33:17.265
you'll walk the fuck out
of here to my car, or not.

1:33:19.466 --> 1:33:21.603
Janice, thank you very much.

1:33:23.171 --> 1:33:24.439
Let's get out of here.

1:33:24.471 --> 1:33:26.041
Let's walk right to it.

1:33:35.382 --> 1:33:37.219
So our
crooked, underpaid cop

1:33:37.252 --> 1:33:40.355
wants to entrap the
crooked, overpaid mob boss.

1:33:40.387 --> 1:33:42.323
He's only got our boy's
fake leprosy money,

1:33:42.356 --> 1:33:44.192
but anyone who
tries to claim that

1:33:44.225 --> 1:33:45.527
will be committing wire fraud,

1:33:45.560 --> 1:33:49.431
which gives him what he
needs, Hynkel behind bars.

1:33:49.463 --> 1:33:52.167
However, surely a mob boss
isn't going to risk it all

1:33:52.199 --> 1:33:55.703
for five grand, right?

1:33:55.737 --> 1:33:57.471
Look, I know we fucked up.

1:33:57.505 --> 1:33:59.440
We both know we fucked up.

1:33:59.474 --> 1:34:00.375
But everything we're doing now

1:34:00.408 --> 1:34:03.177
is about trying to
set it right, so just,

1:34:09.783 --> 1:34:11.386
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:34:12.353 --> 1:34:13.186
You need to get down here.

1:34:13.220 --> 1:34:14.822
- Can I call you back, Janice?
- No.

1:34:14.855 --> 1:34:17.458
You really have
to get down here.

1:34:19.359 --> 1:34:20.395
What happened?

1:34:22.363 --> 1:34:23.399
Shit.

1:34:38.378 --> 1:34:39.448
Fucking hell.

1:34:42.649 --> 1:34:43.551
Holy shit.

1:34:46.121 --> 1:34:47.489
That's my landlord.

1:34:47.521 --> 1:34:50.125
That's also my landlord.

1:34:50.158 --> 1:34:51.427
Oh fuck, sorry.

1:34:53.228 --> 1:34:54.395
We have a bigger problem.

1:34:54.429 --> 1:34:55.697
A bigger problem than this?

1:34:55.729 --> 1:34:56.831
- Oh yeah.
- What?

1:34:58.233 --> 1:34:59.835
That guy I tried
to save you from?

1:35:00.502 --> 1:35:03.438
He just picked up your
brother and took him.

1:35:19.154 --> 1:35:20.322
The one
thing you can depend on

1:35:20.354 --> 1:35:23.357
with greedy men is that their
greed is never satisfied,

1:35:23.390 --> 1:35:26.861
so yes, five grand
was more than enough.

1:35:38.273 --> 1:35:40.475
- Well I'll be damned.
- What?

1:35:40.507 --> 1:35:43.711
That piece of shit cop
has finally proven useful.

1:35:44.445 --> 1:35:47.849
Maybe we should put him
back on the payroll.

1:35:57.225 --> 1:36:00.629
- Yeah.
- I have one of 'em.

1:36:00.662 --> 1:36:02.364
Good, where?

1:36:02.396 --> 1:36:04.332
- In the usual place.
- Done.

1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:08.203
Billy has one of
those Limey pricks.

1:36:09.337 --> 1:36:10.372
Where?

1:36:11.072 --> 1:36:13.675
Let's just say he's
gonna need a shovel.

1:36:13.707 --> 1:36:14.542
Good.

1:36:16.243 --> 1:36:16.944
Terry.

1:36:16.978 --> 1:36:18.078
- Limey prick.
- Terry?

1:36:18.113 --> 1:36:20.815
If you ever want to see
your brother alive again,

1:36:20.847 --> 1:36:24.252
you bring that body
to the desert at dawn,

1:36:24.284 --> 1:36:26.320
- you got me?
- Okay, all right.

1:36:26.354 --> 1:36:27.189
Give me an hour.

1:36:32.426 --> 1:36:34.496
Let's get them out of here.

1:36:34.529 --> 1:36:36.231
Come on, up you get.

1:36:40.335 --> 1:36:42.871
Some guy took Terry
out of here at gunpoint.

1:36:42.904 --> 1:36:44.839
- Is this him?
- That's him.

1:36:44.872 --> 1:36:46.641
Don't suppose he mentioned
where they were headed.

1:36:46.673 --> 1:36:48.342
I didn't ask.

1:36:48.376 --> 1:36:50.779
Are you interested in specials?

1:36:53.014 --> 1:36:54.716
All right, just stop.

1:36:54.748 --> 1:36:56.384
If you were gonna
steal the coffin,

1:36:56.417 --> 1:36:58.420
you must have had a
way to transport it.

1:37:01.389 --> 1:37:02.923
The truck's out back.

1:37:02.957 --> 1:37:04.459
- Shut up.
- Perfect.

1:37:04.492 --> 1:37:06.561
Hey look, I'll make you a deal.

1:37:06.594 --> 1:37:09.498
Help me move this thing and
I'll cut you in on the reward.

1:37:10.664 --> 1:37:13.335
Okay, but we're
coming with you.

1:37:14.269 --> 1:37:15.804
Partners.

1:37:15.837 --> 1:37:18.941
Fine, then everybody's
going to the desert.

1:37:47.502 --> 1:37:49.437
- Nice work, Billy.
- Thank you.

1:37:49.470 --> 1:37:50.372
Where's the other one?

1:37:50.404 --> 1:37:51.939
He'll be here soon.

1:37:52.939 --> 1:37:54.308
Who the fuck are you?

1:37:56.476 --> 1:37:58.445
I'm the last person
you're ever gonna see,

1:37:58.479 --> 1:37:59.715
you little prick.

1:38:01.481 --> 1:38:05.420
Not if my brother has
something to say about it.

1:38:05.453 --> 1:38:08.390
Even if your brother
turns up with 30K,

1:38:08.422 --> 1:38:11.827
you boys, you ain't
leaving the desert.

1:38:13.761 --> 1:38:15.631
We didn't bring
shovels for nothing.

1:38:16.963 --> 1:38:19.400
Stupid fucking Limeys.

1:38:35.449 --> 1:38:37.918
Who the fuck are these people?

1:38:41.555 --> 1:38:43.090
You all right, Terry?

1:38:43.123 --> 1:38:43.958
Kinda.

1:38:44.891 --> 1:38:47.028
Who the fuck are all of you?

1:38:47.060 --> 1:38:48.496
We want the reward.

1:38:48.529 --> 1:38:50.432
What reward?

1:38:50.465 --> 1:38:52.333
Why'd you bring them?

1:38:52.367 --> 1:38:53.935
I needed their truck, okay?

1:38:53.967 --> 1:38:57.471
What, you couldn't borrow
a truck again from Mr. Lloyd?

1:38:57.505 --> 1:39:00.708
Listen, nobody else needs
to lose their ears, okay?

1:39:00.742 --> 1:39:02.043
We got the body.

1:39:02.076 --> 1:39:04.412
What fucking body?

1:39:04.444 --> 1:39:05.746
The body of Charlie Chaplin.

1:39:08.815 --> 1:39:11.418
You Limey pricks stole that?

1:39:11.452 --> 1:39:12.052
Yeah, we did.

1:39:12.086 --> 1:39:13.186
Yeah, we did, okay?

1:39:13.220 --> 1:39:14.955
It's not the best plan in
the world, but it's ours,

1:39:14.988 --> 1:39:16.490
and he's worth 100 grand reward,

1:39:16.524 --> 1:39:18.526
so let's just do
this and get it done.

1:39:18.559 --> 1:39:21.363
Hey, that's our body.

1:39:21.395 --> 1:39:22.663
Someone shut her the fuck up.

1:39:22.697 --> 1:39:23.532
My pleasure.

1:39:24.966 --> 1:39:26.534
Or not.

1:39:26.567 --> 1:39:28.403
We're in control here.

1:39:28.435 --> 1:39:29.670
You, ponytail.

1:39:30.505 --> 1:39:31.873
Go in the back of
the silver Cadillac

1:39:31.905 --> 1:39:33.375
and get the shovels out.

1:39:34.175 --> 1:39:35.577
We're gonna need 'em.

1:39:51.893 --> 1:39:53.662
Who the hell is this?

1:39:59.199 --> 1:40:02.703
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1:40:02.737 --> 1:40:04.506
You two gonna
tell him, or am I?

1:40:10.912 --> 1:40:12.447
What the fuck?

1:40:13.547 --> 1:40:16.784
It's busier than Piccadilly
Circus around here.

1:40:22.155 --> 1:40:23.524
What's going on here?

1:40:24.192 --> 1:40:26.761
Thank God you're here, feeling
a little outnumbered here.

1:40:26.793 --> 1:40:28.195
Everyone needs to
put the guns down

1:40:28.229 --> 1:40:29.831
and kneel on the ground.

1:40:29.863 --> 1:40:30.898
Shoot her now.

1:40:33.568 --> 1:40:35.136
Drop the gun or I'll
blow her fucking head off,

1:40:35.168 --> 1:40:36.770
I mean it, and yours too.

1:40:36.804 --> 1:40:38.739
Now drop the guns, drop them.

1:40:38.773 --> 1:40:39.673
Call for backup.

1:40:41.542 --> 1:40:43.878
- Sorry.
- Gardiner?

1:40:43.911 --> 1:40:45.747
Now look what shit
you've got us into, Terry.

1:40:45.779 --> 1:40:46.814
- Shut up.
- Me?

1:40:46.847 --> 1:40:47.748
Yeah you, who else?

1:40:47.782 --> 1:40:49.016
I didn't fucking do this.

1:40:49.050 --> 1:40:51.119
- This was your idea.
- No it wasn't.

1:40:51.152 --> 1:40:52.520
You said dig up Chaplin.

1:40:52.552 --> 1:40:54.456
- I was drunk.
- You're always drunk.

1:40:54.488 --> 1:40:56.023
Just shut the fuck
up, both of you.

1:40:56.056 --> 1:40:57.658
I've only been drunk once.

1:40:57.692 --> 1:40:59.527
Which has lasted 30 years.

1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:00.628
What's your point?

1:41:00.661 --> 1:41:02.931
How did your country
ever have a fucking empire?

1:41:02.963 --> 1:41:06.801
I said shut

1:41:12.105 --> 1:41:12.940
Annie!

1:41:25.886 --> 1:41:27.087
Fuck me, that was a
bit close, wasn't it?

1:41:27.122 --> 1:41:30.592
I'm telling you, next time
we dig up someone less famous.

1:41:32.158 --> 1:41:34.027
What good would
that do, Terry?

1:41:34.060 --> 1:41:34.895
Help!

1:41:39.567 --> 1:41:41.034
We gotta get her
to the hospital.

1:41:41.068 --> 1:41:42.804
Get the coffin out.

1:41:48.074 --> 1:41:49.144
I know CPR.

1:41:50.578 --> 1:41:52.681
CPR, we don't need CPR.

1:41:53.314 --> 1:41:54.615
Get her in the truck,
get her in the truck.

1:41:54.649 --> 1:41:55.583
She's still breathing.

1:41:55.615 --> 1:41:56.885
You're not a doctor.

1:41:56.917 --> 1:41:57.818
He doesn't need to be a doctor

1:41:57.853 --> 1:42:00.087
to see if she's still
breathing, Terry.

1:42:00.121 --> 1:42:02.590
She didn't even
finish high school.

1:42:02.622 --> 1:42:04.157
What does that have
to do with anything?

1:42:04.190 --> 1:42:06.860
You don't even know
what CPR stands for.

1:42:06.894 --> 1:42:09.063
'Course I do, critical
pressure release.

1:42:09.095 --> 1:42:10.964
Critical pressure release?

1:42:10.997 --> 1:42:13.234
Sounds like you're
having a wank.

1:42:36.623 --> 1:42:39.793
So then they
just left me in the desert.

1:42:39.827 --> 1:42:41.729
I mean, I am a Hollywood icon.

1:42:41.761 --> 1:42:44.298
They just dropped me
like a hot potato,

1:42:44.332 --> 1:42:46.301
but then I guess
it doesn't matter.

1:42:46.333 --> 1:42:47.202
I mean, I am dead.

1:42:47.234 --> 1:42:49.304
It's not like I've
got someplace to be.

1:42:50.237 --> 1:42:52.206
Suppose it's like I used to say,

1:42:52.238 --> 1:42:54.641
nothing is permanent
in this wicked world.

1:42:54.675 --> 1:42:55.844
Not even your troubles.

1:43:04.150 --> 1:43:05.220
- It's him.
- Who?

1:43:05.886 --> 1:43:10.958
Chaplin, the body they've
been talking about on the news.

1:43:10.992 --> 1:43:15.195
- The news?
- Yeah, and there's a reward.

1:43:15.229 --> 1:43:18.066
Well don't just
stand there, call them.

1:43:18.099 --> 1:43:19.734
This must be our lucky day.

1:43:57.404 --> 1:43:58.340
What now, Terry?

1:43:58.372 --> 1:44:00.340
We have to
get out of this city.

1:44:00.373 --> 1:44:01.574
And go where?

1:44:01.609 --> 1:44:03.811
Anywhere, somewhere
we can start all over again.

1:44:03.844 --> 1:44:05.346
You mean
again again again.

1:44:05.378 --> 1:44:07.414
I believe in
second chances, it's calming.

1:44:07.448 --> 1:44:08.115
Terry,
this has got to be

1:44:08.149 --> 1:44:10.318
our tenth or eleventh chance.

1:44:10.350 --> 1:44:11.752
Maybe we should
have just gone bigger.

1:44:11.786 --> 1:44:12.621
Bigger?

1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:15.356
Bigger than Chaplin, who's that?

1:44:16.756 --> 1:44:17.991
John Lennon.

1:44:18.024 --> 1:44:20.327
He's cremated, Terry.

1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:20.961
What about Elvis?

1:44:20.994 --> 1:44:23.664
We know where he's buried.

1:44:23.698 --> 1:44:25.800
Have you
gone completely nuts?

1:44:25.832 --> 1:44:27.734
- Well yeah, but
- You know what,

1:44:27.768 --> 1:44:28.402
it isn't even nuts, is it?

1:44:28.435 --> 1:44:29.804
You're just drinking again.

1:44:32.038 --> 1:44:33.006
Just forget
I said anything.

1:44:33.039 --> 1:44:35.176
No no, you're
gotta be level 10 drunk

1:44:35.208 --> 1:44:36.943
to have suggested Elvis.

1:44:36.976 --> 1:44:38.712
You ever
been to Memphis?

1:44:39.447 --> 1:44:40.782
All right, well
we should look it up

1:44:40.814 --> 1:44:41.815
just to investigate this.

1:44:41.849 --> 1:44:43.251
I'm not saying yes, Terry.
