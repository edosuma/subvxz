00:03.738 --> 00:06.071
Previously on The Royals...

00:06.073 --> 00:08.007
- Maybe I find you...
- Pathetic.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.608
Attractive.

00:10.745 --> 00:14.480
I want you to be devoted
to my wellbeing full-time.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.116
- You wanna get out of here?
- Absolutely.

00:17.118 --> 00:20.619
You have an opportunity
to inspire us.

00:20.755 --> 00:23.022
Maybe the answer
isn't walking away.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.592
Maybe you should try and
change it from the inside.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.528
Yesterday, when you found me
in an alley...

00:29.530 --> 00:32.031
Not in an alley.
I found you in the park.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.800
This was hanging around my neck the
night before the King was killed.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.770
- What does it mean?
- We figure this out,

00:37.772 --> 00:40.172
we figure out who's been
killing my family.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.408
And then we make them pay.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.511
I hope I didn't keep
you waiting.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.246
I'd wait a lifetime for you.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.284
It's nothing personal,
Captain Lacey.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.820
- (Gunshot)
- You tell me what you did!

00:54.822 --> 00:57.122
He's dead.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.194
Are you holding?
Come on, hook a girl up.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.063
I can't help you, okay?

01:04.065 --> 01:08.133
Ouch! Feisty princess.

01:08.135 --> 01:11.103
- What is this?
- An early birthday present.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.572
Oh, my...

01:13.574 --> 01:16.275
You and diamonds,
like gin and tonic,

01:16.277 --> 01:18.377
are destined for each other.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.279
So, what's your poison?

01:20.281 --> 01:22.714
Drugs? Booze? Boys?

01:22.716 --> 01:25.584
- Yes!
- Okay, I hear that.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.153
- I'm Len.
- Mandy.

01:28.155 --> 01:30.289
I was happy
when I saw you in my bed.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.828
You fell in love with her.
You know how I know?

01:35.830 --> 01:38.764
You had her in your pocket,
you didn't follow through.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.166
Don't worry because we're
stealing that diamond

01:41.168 --> 01:42.701
and getting the hell
out of here.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.403

James on the ride back,

02:06.560 --> 02:09.728
probably about after the
ninth repeat in a row.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.798
Trust me,
James has seen far worse

02:12.800 --> 02:17.669
like that time he was being
personally tortured

02:17.671 --> 02:20.739
by Saddam Hussein in Kuwait,

02:20.741 --> 02:22.741
or wherever the hell
that was.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.677
Not even close.
Night, ladies.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.282
You are going to look
so banging

02:30.284 --> 02:31.717
for the party tomorrow night.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.886
I mean, all this PLUS your
gran's earrings?

02:34.889 --> 02:36.855
Damn, girl. Come with me.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.261
You have to.
You're the birthday girl,

02:42.263 --> 02:43.896
you get what you want.

02:43.898 --> 02:46.565
Have them set it in the
necklace and voila.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.301
But it's not even mine.
It belongs to the people.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.203
Trust me, the people want
their princess

02:51.205 --> 02:52.738
to wear it for her birthday.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.374
It's just not as pretty
behind glass.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.876
It needs to be let out and
taste freedom once in a while.

02:57.878 --> 03:01.813
I'm sure they would rather see
it on you than your uncle.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.652
Are you sure
it's not too much, though?

03:06.654 --> 03:09.288
I mean, our birthdays are
always just a reason

03:09.290 --> 03:11.623
for my mother to throw
a hoity-toity gala.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.425
They're never even about us.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.894
Was that supposed to be
a reason for not wearing it?

03:15.896 --> 03:18.864
You deserve to be the center
of attention on a normal day.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.766
Your Succession Bill quietly
passed late last night

03:54.768 --> 03:56.802
with barely the margin
we needed.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.670

And, with Lucius and Cyrus
dominating the headlines,

04:08.983 --> 04:12.284
people won't even notice
the succession has changed.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.720
That is to say, no one knows.

It's nice when all your

What of the gala

- I'm hit.
- Not in the face!

05:14.381 --> 05:16.014
Please! Have mercy.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.351
The pain! The pain!

05:19.353 --> 05:21.420
- You guys are so weird.
- Help.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.555
- How did you know?
- It's not a dorm room.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.424
It's a palace.
I have security.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.693
Is the Queen's high society
birthday party

05:27.695 --> 05:30.996
- still in effect tonight?
- The guest list is ancient.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.432
It's alright. Some of those
old timers can party.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.502
Any royal cougars?

05:51.819 --> 05:53.585
Is that...?

05:53.587 --> 05:56.121
The Crown Jeweler will set
it in the necklace for me!

05:56.123 --> 05:58.423
But I talked him into five
minutes with it

05:58.425 --> 06:01.026
so that I could
"plan my outfit."

06:02.062 --> 06:03.929
- Gimme, gimme!
- Sshh!

06:03.931 --> 06:06.898
There are two guards out
there for this thing

06:06.900 --> 06:10.736
who would flip if they knew someone
else had their mitts on it.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.537
(Text alert)

06:17.111 --> 06:20.812
Of course. Rachel says my
mother's not even coming.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.881
We should just cancel.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.617
I mean, our birthdays have
always been more about her

06:25.619 --> 06:28.086
and her old boring friends
than us, anyway.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.056
Just some lame excuse
for a gala,

06:31.058 --> 06:33.925
each year more boring
than the last.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.695
Even when you guys were kids?

06:36.697 --> 06:38.997
Not even one
special birthday?

06:40.033 --> 06:43.001
Once. It was our ninth.

06:43.003 --> 06:46.772
The Queen was away on some
official trip to Toronto,

06:46.774 --> 06:50.108
so my dad threw us, like,
a real kids' birthday party.

06:50.110 --> 06:54.179
Carnival games, the whole
deal. We had dodgems, even!

06:54.948 --> 06:57.015
I'm sorry, what-ems?

06:57.017 --> 07:00.118
Dodgems! The little cars you
smash into each other with.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.087
Ohhh... bumper cars.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.857
Sure.
And he had this cake made

07:05.859 --> 07:07.759
that we had to jump out of.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.096
Hold this.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.032
I gotta go.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.802
You're a model
who blew off her gig.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.937
Where could you possibly
have to be?

07:18.939 --> 07:22.174
Well, it may or may not have
to do with your birthday.

07:22.176 --> 07:24.609
Which is NOT being canceled,
by the way.

- For the twins' birthday.

birthday again?

celebrating
those little shits.

08:15.696 --> 08:15.961
What do you want to do, then?

08:20.934 --> 08:24.903

09:33.040 --> 09:35.173
You still work here?

09:35.175 --> 09:37.075
Please.
Just one question. Please.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.077
Fine, if it means you'll be
gone quicker.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.712

09:40.714 --> 09:42.314

know Mandy?

09:46.119 --> 09:47.819
Including your own.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.889
I'm happy. Doesn't anybody
care that I'm happy?

09:50.891 --> 09:53.258
Of course I do. But aren't
you moving a little fast?

09:53.260 --> 09:56.094
She's stayed over almost
every night last week.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.064
Sorry, what business is that
of yours?

09:59.066 --> 10:01.666
I'm getting really sick
of trying to find ways

10:01.668 --> 10:04.069
to tell you that I am sick
of you and your games.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.837
Get over it.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.206
Stop being such a jealous
ex-bodyguard.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.809
I just want to make sure
you're protected.

10:10.811 --> 10:14.245
You don't get the privilege
of protecting me any longer.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.982
Thank God.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.775
- Lady Holloway.
- Your Majesty.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.245
I'll get some wine.

10:52.653 --> 10:56.254
You are truly
a petulant disgrace.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.157
You make a mockery of
the country and the crown.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.892
First with
your pitiful tirade,

11:00.894 --> 11:03.995
then flaunting this pitiful
bimbo around in public.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.665
All this, not to mention
what you did to my husband.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.968
Promising he'd be Prime
Minister, then reneging.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.170
Maybe you should ask
Mr. Holloway the truth

11:12.172 --> 11:14.072
about why our deal is off.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.007
You two will have a lot
to talk about.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.876
Where is he tonight,
by the way?

11:17.878 --> 11:20.311
Working hard after you
shafted him.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.781
More like working
someone's hard shaft.

11:22.783 --> 11:26.985
Enjoy the show. I hear
there's a surprise ending.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.193
So once I've poured
enough liquor down her,

11:35.195 --> 11:37.429
I'll get her alone and switch
the real one for that.

11:37.431 --> 11:40.198
Not bad for 3500 bucks,
right?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.367
I mean, convincing enough
on its own,

11:42.369 --> 11:44.769
but five drinks,
and she'll never know.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.740
You did that thing
with the camera?

11:48.742 --> 11:51.042
Looped a decoy feed, or
I wouldn't be standing here.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.312
It was literally in my hands
hours ago!

11:55.248 --> 11:57.882
Dude! Snap out of it.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.984
This was your plan.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.454
You fell for her, I get it,

12:02.456 --> 12:04.289
because you have a dick
and she's hot.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.324
But time to come back
to reality.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.260
For what we've been talking
about for two years.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.796
We are so close.

12:14.101 --> 12:17.268
You remember that night we took that
guy at the Bellagio for ten grand?

12:17.871 --> 12:22.974
I was so excited and you were
your typical Jasper self,

12:22.976 --> 12:26.010
all "it's cool, no big deal."

12:28.081 --> 12:32.016
Then we, uh... celebrated...

12:32.018 --> 12:34.052
on his penthouse balcony.

12:36.323 --> 12:39.457
I'll never forget what you
said to me after that.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.326
You were done
with those jobs.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.528
After watching your parents
scrape by

12:43.530 --> 12:45.897
on small score
after small score,

12:45.899 --> 12:47.465
you were done.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.535
Then what did you say to me?

12:55.308 --> 12:56.975
You just need one great job.

12:56.977 --> 13:01.212
And that looks like one hell
of a great job to me.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.457
Have you heard from them?

13:12.459 --> 13:14.425
Your folks?

13:15.829 --> 13:18.296
Last I heard,
they were being evicted

13:18.298 --> 13:20.865
from Desert Oasis
Trailer Park.

13:22.836 --> 13:26.371
You're so close to proving
that you're not your dad.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.941
That you're smarter than him.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.344
More talented than him.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.246
That you have better taste...

13:35.248 --> 13:37.048
in everything.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.358
- How...?
- Once you lied to the world,

13:47.360 --> 13:50.361
I knew I was a dead man. So I was
prepared when they walked in.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.430
Alistair, I need you
to know that I,

13:52.432 --> 13:56.167
No, Helena, this is where
I speak and you listen.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.103
I realize now that it's
always been about you,

13:59.105 --> 14:00.905
that I was your convenience.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.440
I'm meant to be grateful

14:02.442 --> 14:04.375
for whatever time I had with
you, and I was.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.377
For 30 years.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.947
Until you dragged Henry's
name through the mud.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.615
That really woke me up.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.318
So, yes, I'm alive.
But not to you.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.487
Not anymore.
To you, I'm dead forever.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.860
That's the speech I'd
prepared to give you.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.163
Until I remembered the kids.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.132
Are they my kids?

14:28.134 --> 14:30.535
Or was that just another lie?

14:30.537 --> 14:33.605
In all truthfulness, I don't
know if the twins are yours.

14:33.607 --> 14:36.407
In the back of my mind,
I've always wondered.

14:37.644 --> 14:41.613
Believe me, Alistair,
this is not a lie.

14:41.615 --> 14:44.449
I promise I will never lie
to you again.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.652
It's the kids' birthday
party tonight.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.455
And yet you're here.

14:50.457 --> 14:53.358
Stuck in your own head,
like you always are.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.026
Never
considering anyone else.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.594
That's not true, Alistair.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.330
Not when we were here,
when we were young,

14:59.332 --> 15:01.499
before I got caught up
in a tide

15:01.501 --> 15:04.469
bigger than any one person
could bear.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.644
I'm not the cruel person
you're making me out to be.

15:12.646 --> 15:15.313
You still had a choice,
Helena.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.449
Everything you've done
has been for one purpose:

15:18.451 --> 15:20.285
getting yourself
on the throne.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.553
And with this new
Succession Bill,

15:22.555 --> 15:25.556
it's all coming together
the way you always wanted.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.159
None of this
is the way I wanted it.

15:28.161 --> 15:31.029
You think I'd have chosen for
things to turn out how they did?

15:31.031 --> 15:33.231
Maybe so.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.433
But you've never had
to sacrifice anything

15:35.435 --> 15:39.070
while everyone around you
continues to lose everything.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.041
Don't you see the twins
are the only ones left?

15:43.043 --> 15:45.176
Hold on to what little
you have left with them

15:45.178 --> 15:46.945
because without them,

15:46.947 --> 15:49.480
you'll be completely alone.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.968
Everybody is looking up here.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.536
The way you look,
you should be used

16:11.538 --> 16:14.539
- to eyes in your direction.
- This is different.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.274
I feel ashamed.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.276
Like I've done
something wrong.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.211
Am I a disgrace to the crown?

16:20.213 --> 16:22.080
Nonsense.

16:22.082 --> 16:25.984
You're an inspiring vision
of peace and purity.

16:25.986 --> 16:30.154
It's those Philistine bitches
who are the disgrace.

16:30.156 --> 16:33.725
Darling, know that with you
by my side,

16:33.727 --> 16:36.294

shone brighter.

This is so absurd.

16:46.473 --> 16:50.208
Oh, my God!
And now we're turning.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.477

16:52.479 --> 16:56.180

so much trouble.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.472

did you do all this?

17:21.473 --> 17:24.742
Luckily, you guys roll with one of the
best party-throwers on the planet.

17:24.743 --> 17:27.244
All I had to was distract you
and swipe your phone

17:27.247 --> 17:30.381
- and steal Holden's number.
- You sneaky bitch.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.350
This is insane!

17:32.352 --> 17:35.553

the memo on the change of plans.

when it officially
becomes your birthday.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.368
All of this is just foreplay.
