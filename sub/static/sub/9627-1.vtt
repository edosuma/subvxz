00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:57.024 --> 00:58.724
- Mickey, Ben?
- Yeah?

00:58.726 --> 01:00.859
- Mr. Jacobson's ready for you.
- Great.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.628
Before we get
the meeting started,

01:02.630 --> 01:04.830
I need to do one quick thing,
if you don't mind.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.432
Will, over here real quick.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.333
- How's that look?
- Uh...

01:08.335 --> 01:10.235
- This is a first.
- It's perfect.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.804
Okay, good.
Let's get... here.

01:11.806 --> 01:14.126
- You want to put one there?
- Put one in that corner.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.777
Every storyline,
every plot twist,

01:18.779 --> 01:20.345
every character arc

01:20.347 --> 01:22.681
of every so-called
"reality show"...

01:22.683 --> 01:24.950
Is preconceived by a team
of writers and producers...

01:24.952 --> 01:27.086
To manipulate "reality"...

01:27.088 --> 01:28.587
Into entertainment.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.091
Okay, understood. Audiences are
getting bored with faux reality.

01:32.093 --> 01:35.127
So, what is
your revolutionary idea?

01:35.129 --> 01:38.163
I want to produce a reality show
that is genuinely real.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.199
I propose we pick
a subject at random.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.733
Mr. and Mrs. anybody.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.269
And we make that person
the subject of our series.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.572
The star of our show.

01:46.574 --> 01:49.341
Without their knowledge.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.243
Come again?

01:51.245 --> 01:53.078
I say we pick
an unwitting subject,

01:53.080 --> 01:55.747
and without their knowledge,
we put their entire lives...

01:55.749 --> 01:58.417
Under complete and
all-encompassing surveillance.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.085
And because they have no idea...

02:00.087 --> 02:02.087
That they are the subject
of this reality show,

02:02.089 --> 02:05.324
their behavior will be
100% natural.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.693
Guys, this does not sound legal.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.061
Interesting idea,

02:09.062 --> 02:11.196
but it smells like
a lawsuit waiting to happen.

02:11.198 --> 02:13.932
Leonard, we predicted you might
voice just such a concern.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.434
We've taken the Liberty...

02:15.436 --> 02:17.202
Of doing extensive research
into the issue.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.304
Granted, installing hidden
cameras in people's home, work,

02:19.306 --> 02:21.840
technically could be in
violation of trespassing laws

02:21.842 --> 02:23.041
or breaking and entering laws,

02:23.043 --> 02:24.943
but, at most,
be considered a misdemeanor...

02:24.945 --> 02:26.445
And would cost a fine.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.180
We had the agency's
legal department...

02:28.182 --> 02:30.149
Do a risk-versus-cost
benefit analysis.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.950
We projected the
worst-case scenario, Leonard.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.286
Okay?
Should our subject sue,

02:34.288 --> 02:38.524
<i>at most</i>
a payout would cap off...

02:38.526 --> 02:40.259
At under $1.5 million.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.028
- It's a no-fucking-brainer.
- I humbly believe,

02:43.030 --> 02:46.031
and it happens to be the opinion
of our legal team as well,

02:46.033 --> 02:48.033
that any suit
would be dismissed anyway,

02:48.035 --> 02:50.636
because, technically,
actual reality,

02:50.638 --> 02:52.204
as opposed to staged reality,

02:52.206 --> 02:54.273
would fall under the category
of documentary,

02:54.275 --> 02:56.341
which would fall under the
category of news, which would...

02:56.343 --> 02:58.410
Fall under the protection
of the first amendment,

02:58.412 --> 02:59.945
freedom of the press, et cetera.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.880
Who is this magical somebody?

03:01.882 --> 03:03.882
Who's this instant star
that everybody's gonna be...

03:03.884 --> 03:05.083
So fascinated by?

03:05.085 --> 03:07.452
This show is proof positive
that anybody...

03:07.454 --> 03:10.522
<i>Anybody</i> is fascinating.

03:10.524 --> 03:14.159
We pick our subject...
At random.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.464
- I love it. Let's do it.
- Oh.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.134
- That's great, great.
- Wait, wait, wait.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.770
Wait, wait. Leonard,
this whole legal issue

03:24.772 --> 03:26.805
it makes me very nervous.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.273
Fuck it.
- Cunt.

03:28.275 --> 03:30.475
This is the kind
of cutting-edge content...

03:30.477 --> 03:32.544
That could turn
this whole stale genre around.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.046
- But...
- "But."

03:34.048 --> 03:36.915
- There's always a "but."
- Shut up. Listen.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.884
I'll give you
the eight episodes.

03:38.886 --> 03:42.621
But you gotta promise me this
is gonna be fucking riveting.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.456
You have my word.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.859
When I hit this space bar,

03:49.163 --> 03:52.397
it's gonna stop on somebody.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.167
And in keeping
with the conceit of this show,

03:55.169 --> 03:58.704
whoever it stops on
is who we go with.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.839
Here we go. Three...

04:00.841 --> 04:02.841
No, you know what?
I got it.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.277
Shane, get over here.
You do it.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.613
Me? Why?

04:07.615 --> 04:09.781
Why?
Somebody gives you...

04:09.783 --> 04:11.450
The opportunity
to be a part of history,

04:11.452 --> 04:12.751
and you say, "why?"

04:12.753 --> 04:14.720
"Neil, you be the first one
to walk on the moon."

04:14.722 --> 04:16.421
"Why?"

04:16.423 --> 04:18.923
Shane, get your ass over here
and do this thing.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.259
This is an honor.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.427
Stand here.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.696
What's the matter with you?
Give me your little hand.

04:24.698 --> 04:28.433
Now, loosen your hands.
Three. Three.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.536
Do a three.

04:31.538 --> 04:34.139
Two.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.340
One

04:38.345 --> 04:41.647
name: Dennis Paul Warwick, 49.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.548
He's currently employed
as a c.P.A...

04:43.550 --> 04:45.517
For Vogel and stern.

04:45.519 --> 04:49.054
He pays his taxes on time,
his fico score is 822...

04:49.056 --> 04:50.555
Almost perfect.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.357
Top three Google searches:

04:52.359 --> 04:56.695
Recipes, math games, and stamps.

04:56.697 --> 05:00.165
Wow. Recipes,
math games, and stamps.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.700
Shut the fuck up, Shane.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.336
Dennis is married
to Katherine fay Warwick.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.737
She's a former teacher...

05:05.739 --> 05:07.939
But left to become
a full-time mom...

05:07.941 --> 05:11.977
To Amy Ann Warwick.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.912
Just turned 18.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.315
Uh, g.P.A. Is 4.0.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.116
She's on the swim team,
debate team,

05:18.118 --> 05:19.951
captain of
the cheerleading squad,

05:19.953 --> 05:21.653
and vice president
of the student council.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.755
And the fourth member
of the family,

05:23.757 --> 05:25.457
seven-year-old
neutered male...

05:25.459 --> 05:27.859
Wheaten terrier mix named Harry.

05:27.861 --> 05:31.096
<i>Hello.</i>

05:31.098 --> 05:33.465
Hello,
is this Dennis Paul Warwick...

05:33.467 --> 05:35.701
Of 5309 stratford road?

05:35.703 --> 05:37.202
<i>Yes, it is.
Who's calling?</i>

05:37.204 --> 05:39.037
Mr. Warwick, my name
is Jerome hellman.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.872
I'm calling from office city.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.408
Did you recently purchase
an ink cartridge...

05:43.410 --> 05:45.477
<i>From our online store
using American express,</i>

05:45.479 --> 05:47.979
last four digits: 1437?

05:47.981 --> 05:49.681
<i>Yes, I did.
Is there something wrong?</i>

05:49.683 --> 05:50.982
Far from it, Mr. Warwick.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.752
You may not be aware
that your online purchase...

05:53.754 --> 05:55.821
<i>Entered you in our tropical
getaway sweepstakes.</i>

05:55.823 --> 05:57.489
<i>You and your family have won...</i>

05:57.491 --> 05:59.458
An all-expense paid
luxury vacation to...

05:59.460 --> 06:02.527
The kalala Hawaii resort and spa
in Maui.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.296
What?

06:48.642 --> 06:50.475
Zoom in.

06:51.779 --> 06:52.779
Pan right.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.155
Home again, home again,
jiggity jig.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.026
I need a vacation
from that vacation.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.895
Oh.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.431
I'm exhausted.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.065
I'm gonna take a shower.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.268
Stacy and I were talking about
going to Sushi.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.103
Bye-bye.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.540
What an unexpected treat.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.146
Hey, if, um,
Amy's taking a shower,

07:28.148 --> 07:30.182
shouldn't we be looking at that?

07:30.184 --> 07:32.217
It just seems more interesting.

07:32.219 --> 07:35.487
Don't be a pig, Shane.
Although we should follow Amy.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.522
See if she's really going
to this "Stacy's"...

07:37.524 --> 07:39.024
Or maybe somewhere else.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.426
- Put the "b" team on that.
- "B" team.

07:41.428 --> 07:44.262
Be prepared to follow Amy
in about 10 minutes.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.264
<i>Copy.</i>

07:47.801 --> 07:49.868
Although I suppose
if Amy's taking a shower,

07:49.870 --> 07:52.037
it couldn't hurt
to have a little peek.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.842
What? If they
want it for sweeps...

08:06.186 --> 08:08.653
That hotel was beautiful,

08:08.655 --> 08:11.756
but nothing beats being back
in your own bed, right?

08:11.758 --> 08:14.292
Mmm, right.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.850
What? No sex?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.519
Why don't you go to Amy's room?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.587
Maybe she's rubbing one out
to her team Edward poster.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.565
So, the craft expo's coming back
in a couple weeks.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.334
Barbara said I could sell
my ornaments at her booth.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.069
Mmm. That sounds good.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.838
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on, dad.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.840
- I don't want to be late.
- Hey.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.142
I have a student council meeting
before first period.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.777
- Mmm. Love you.
- Bye-bye.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.313
- Go, beavers.
- Go, beavers.

09:08.315 --> 09:11.850
And just remember:
Mango moves, papaya plugs.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.419
- Dad.
- Mango moves, papaya plugs.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.054
Stop it.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.160
Hey, Mickey.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.929
So, Leonard is so excited
about this show...

09:57.931 --> 10:00.599
That he wants to include it
in the presentation next week...

10:00.601 --> 10:02.767
At the affiliates' dinner
in New York City.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.604
- That's fantastic.
- And we need a sizzle reel,

10:05.606 --> 10:08.306
- and we need it asap.
- A sizzle reel?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.674
It's only been a week.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.476
We do need it
by the end of tomorrow...

10:11.478 --> 10:13.244
So we can include it
in the show reel.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.512
Tomorrow?

10:15.716 --> 10:17.515
Shane, steal the dog.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.783
What?

10:18.785 --> 10:21.086
Nobody's at home.
Go in the house, steal the dog.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.854
Before they get back
from their stupid swap meet.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.856
When you go in,
leave the door open a bit,

10:24.858 --> 10:27.292
like it was left unlocked
and that's how the dog got out.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.827
But that's fake.

10:28.829 --> 10:32.364
It is absolutely not fake.
The dog could have gotten out.

10:32.366 --> 10:33.832
Dogs get out all the time.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.834
All that matters
is that their reactions...

10:35.836 --> 10:37.836
Are 100% authentic.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.871
It's not like we're not
gonna give it back.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.240
Now, go in the house
and get the fucking dog.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.244
Hey, Harry.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.847
Here, Harry.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.117
Here... here, boy.

10:53.353 --> 10:56.521
Come on, Harry.
Come on, Harry.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.823
Ah! Come on, boy.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.092
Shane...

11:01.094 --> 11:03.762
What an idiot.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.234
J-mo, help him in,
help him in.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.903
Don't hurt the dog.
Otherwise we're fucked.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.205
Sit over here.
You're holding him wrong.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.175
You're gonna break his paw.
Shit, here they come back now.

11:20.113 --> 11:23.248
Oh, I'm so hungry too,
and I'm exhausted.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.850
What do you guys
want to eat?

11:25.852 --> 11:28.253
I need to sit down
for a few minutes anyway.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.588
- What the...
- Hmm.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.791
- The door's open.
- Oh, my god.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.592
- Did you leave it open?
- Do you think someone...

11:34.594 --> 11:36.995
- I didn't leave it open.
- You think somebody broke in?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.730
<i>- Where's Harry?
- It doesn't look like it.</i>

11:38.732 --> 11:40.331
<i>- Harry?
- Harry?</i>

11:40.333 --> 11:42.600
Harry? Honey, go upstairs
and look and see if the dog's...

11:42.602 --> 11:45.370
Under your bed. How he hides
under your bed sometimes.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.005
Now we're getting somewhere.

11:47.007 --> 11:50.608
- You guys, he's not upstairs.
- Great. Who left the door open?

11:50.610 --> 11:53.244
- He's ran away, dad.
- I don't know. Let's go look.

11:53.246 --> 11:56.247
Oh! Honey! Harry!

11:56.249 --> 11:58.183
- You go that way.
- Harry, where are you?

11:58.185 --> 12:01.119
- You go that way. Come on!
- Go that way. Oh!

12:01.121 --> 12:03.555
- Who left the door open?
- Oh, my gosh.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.889
Dennis, where's the dog?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.324
This is good.
This is good.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.493
You go that way, okay?
I'll go this way.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.962
Fine.
I swear, I'm just gonna...

12:10.964 --> 12:12.997
- I didn't...
- Just get in the car.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.733
Yes!

12:14.735 --> 12:16.101
Roll down the windows.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.936
Call for him as we go.
Keep your eyes open.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.537
Harry!

12:19.539 --> 12:21.906
This is real human drama now.

12:37.224 --> 12:40.058
He's here.
Hurry, hurry, come look.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.160
- Oh, my god!
- Hi.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.528
Oh! Harry!

12:43.530 --> 12:46.898
Oh, you little stinker!

12:46.900 --> 12:48.900
- Oh!
- Thank you so much.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.902
- No problem.
- Oh, he's...

12:50.904 --> 12:52.937
- Where did you find him?
- Sleeping in my tomato plants.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.540
I live a few blocks
down that way.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.177
- Nice to meet you.
- All right.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.546
- Thank you so much.
- Can't thank you enough.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.048
- Our doggy's home!
- Oh, Harry.

13:04.050 --> 13:07.752
Sweet. That's so sweet.
Oh, that's good.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.222
Hey. Hey, val.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.724
So how was I?

13:12.726 --> 13:14.526
Great, great, perfect.
Thanks for helping out.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.594
So you gonna tell me
what this show is about?

13:16.596 --> 13:17.796
Later, later, later.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.998
Okay. Here we go.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.566
Come on, come on.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.402
I think it's terrible.
It's just terrible.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.371
What's so terrible about it?

13:26.373 --> 13:29.140
To put people under surveillance
without their knowledge.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.142
To broadcast
all their dirty laundry...

13:31.144 --> 13:32.911
In front of millions of people
on television.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.413
Are you kidding me?
This poor man and his family.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.449
Poor man? Once these episodes
start airing,

13:38.451 --> 13:40.084
this guy's gonna be famous.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.319
Just because something
is successful,

13:41.321 --> 13:42.921
it doesn't mean that it's right.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.190
Can't imagine that this
isn't gonna land you in jail.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.559
Jail? Absolutely not.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.861
The lawyers have sleuthed-out
every loophole.

13:49.863 --> 13:53.164
The network is 100% behind it.
They believe in me.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.800
They know I can make
these people fascinating.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.869
And frankly I'm bummed out
that you're not more supportive.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.205
- Is that Shane?
- What?

14:00.207 --> 14:02.941
Over there.
Is that Shane at that table?

14:02.943 --> 14:05.610
- Yeah, of course.
- Why? What's Shane doing there?

14:05.612 --> 14:09.080
He's filming your close-up.
And j-mo is filming my close-up.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.685
And that plumbing truck
is getting the wide master.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.688
You've been taping
this whole lunch?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.990
I've been taping everything
since I came up with the idea.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.159
- I even taped the pitch.
- This is not cool, Mickey.

14:21.161 --> 14:24.162
- This is not cool.
- Where you going?

14:24.164 --> 14:25.496
Thank god I saw Shane...

14:25.498 --> 14:27.498
Before I talked about
my brother's problem.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.134
It wouldn't have killed you
to tell me we'd film this lunch.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.769
That's the point of the show.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.572
People don't act naturally when
they know they're on camera.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.574
Whatever, whatever.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.625
Oh.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.304
God!

15:06.306 --> 15:08.373
- Smoked salmon Benedict.
- Thank you.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.540
And mimosas.

15:09.542 --> 15:13.177
Ooh-la-la.
Booze before 7 A.M.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.313
It is a very special day,
isn't it?

15:15.315 --> 15:16.614
Mmm-mmm.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.616
Ten bucks says we get to see
some morning sex.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.118
You're on.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.854
- Mmm. Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

15:22.856 --> 15:24.322
<i>Happy anniversary.</i>

15:24.324 --> 15:26.057
Thank you.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.725
I hate to break up
this love-fest,

15:27.727 --> 15:29.961
but I've got cheerleading
practice before first period.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.896
- Okay, let's go.
- Hurry up, dad.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.546
- Gotta run. See you at lunch?
- Yeah.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.682
- I love you.
- I love you too.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.017
- Bye, Stacy.
- Bye.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.019
God, he's so good-looking.

15:55.021 --> 15:57.622
I don't know how you can
keep your hands off him.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.958
- You're obsessed with sex.
- I am not!

15:59.960 --> 16:02.794
If I had a boyfriend
like Mike, I might be.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.196
- You need a boyfriend, period.
- Ya think?

16:05.198 --> 16:07.298
There'll be plenty of time
for sex and all that stuff...

16:07.300 --> 16:08.633
After we're married.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.069
Yeah, if he waits around
that long.

16:11.071 --> 16:14.172
Honey, he will.
We have it all planned out.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.673
Oh, yeah, right.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.142
Like Mike is gonna wait
till marriage to have sex.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.477
Give me a break.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.079
I bet they hook up tonight.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.947
Lot of those girls
who like to stay virgins...

16:22.949 --> 16:24.182
Until they're married,

16:24.184 --> 16:25.450
- they'll do anal.
- It's true.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.918
Aw, that's gross.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.820
- What? It's true.
- Let's hope so.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.154
We could use
a little teenage sodomy...

16:30.156 --> 16:32.036
To spice things up on this show.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.426
We are in great shape.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.528
Everyone in New York loves it,

16:37.530 --> 16:40.198
and what they love
is that it's real...

16:40.200 --> 16:42.900
Real people doing real things,
untainted by the knowledge...

16:42.902 --> 16:44.402
That they are being filmed.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.537
This has caught the attention
from the affiliates...

16:46.539 --> 16:48.940
And from some
pretty big sponsors already.

16:48.942 --> 16:52.210
We are already negotiating
product placement deals.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.112
Holy shit balls!

16:54.114 --> 16:58.416
We have pearly smile toothpaste,
we have wrecking ball condoms,

16:58.418 --> 17:00.118
and blump's peanut butter.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.686
- Great!
- Wait a minute.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.788
What do you mean,
"product placement deals"?

17:03.790 --> 17:06.557
The advertisers,
they pay a premium,

17:06.559 --> 17:08.726
which then they cross-promote
our show...

17:08.728 --> 17:10.428
Through their own
advertising network.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.030
I know what
a product placement deal is,

17:12.031 --> 17:13.698
but how can I guarantee
that the warwicks...

17:13.700 --> 17:15.833
Will use these products if they
don't know they're being filmed?

17:15.835 --> 17:18.102
You managed to get all
the cameras inside the house.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.671
How hard could it be
to get a tube of toothpaste...

17:20.673 --> 17:22.140
In their hands?

17:26.378 --> 17:28.713
No, you stay here.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.753
Housekeeper's gone.
House is clear.

17:35.755 --> 17:36.854
Here, put these on.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.123
How's that look?
All right, good.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.125
I need you to plant
the toothpaste...

17:41.127 --> 17:43.861
In the master bathroom
on Katherine's sink.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.064
I need you to put
the wrecking ball condoms...

17:46.066 --> 17:48.266
Are those for old men
with saggy balls?

17:49.269 --> 17:51.135
And I want you to plant them...

17:51.137 --> 17:54.539
In Dennis's gym bag, which is
in the master bedroom closet.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.641
And I need you to put
the peanut butter...

17:56.643 --> 17:58.309
In the pantry in the kitchen.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.311
Move your ass.

18:11.424 --> 18:15.393
Ugh! Gah. These condoms
are crap, by the way.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.761
How the fuck would you know?

18:16.763 --> 18:19.003
You've never been laid a day
in your fucking life.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.466
Hey.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.068
Now put the peanut butter
in the pantry.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.637
Mickey, check this out.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.673
- Shane...
- Yeah, you want that?

18:28.675 --> 18:31.843
Want that? Yeah?

18:31.845 --> 18:34.812
Shane, that's cruel. Stop it.
Shane, the dog's gonna choke.

18:36.082 --> 18:38.983
<i>He's awesome.</i>

18:38.985 --> 18:41.052
Hey, Mickey.

18:41.054 --> 18:43.321
Shane, Shane, Amy's coming home.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.022
There we go.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.193
She's going in the back door.
Out the front door.

18:49.195 --> 18:51.929
Quick! Out the front door!

18:56.369 --> 18:59.303
Shit! Upstairs, quick.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.205
<i>Upstairs.</i>

19:03.743 --> 19:05.176
<i>Shane? Shane?</i>

19:05.178 --> 19:06.944
Shane, can you hear me?

19:06.946 --> 19:09.080
As soon as she's distracted,
leave the room, all right?

19:09.082 --> 19:10.715
- Warwick?
- Yes.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.783
She's distracted.
Now, out, out!

19:14.187 --> 19:16.821
No, wait! Go back, go back!
She's coming upstairs!

19:16.823 --> 19:18.089
Closet! Closet!

19:29.369 --> 19:31.502
Oh, shit! Shane!

19:39.879 --> 19:42.079
All right, she's in
the bathroom. Move, move!

19:55.695 --> 19:58.596
Made it.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.632
- And with the goods. Oh, yeah.
- Shane, sit your ass down!

20:01.634 --> 20:03.901
You almost blew
this whole fucking show!

20:05.004 --> 20:06.571
And give me
those goddamn panties.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.475
Who is it, Harry?

20:15.415 --> 20:17.348
The ups guy's long gone.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.287
- <i>Hey, aimsie-waymsie.</i>
- Hey, stace.

20:23.289 --> 20:24.755
- <i>Ready to get your fitness on?</i>
- Yeah.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.058
- I'm headed to the gym now.
- <i>Okay, sounds good.</i>

20:27.060 --> 20:29.427
Do you want me to pick you up,
or should I...

20:29.429 --> 20:30.928
<i>Amy?</i>

20:30.930 --> 20:34.432
<i>Ames? Amy, oh, my god! Amy!</i>

20:34.434 --> 20:36.701
<i>Amy!</i>

20:36.703 --> 20:38.536
Give me those fucking panties.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.204
No, they're mine.
I earned them.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.439
That's petty theft.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.040
The biggest ships
always go down...

20:43.042 --> 20:44.442
Because of
the smallest offenses.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.377
Do you know what catches
most serial killers?

20:46.379 --> 20:49.113
Parking tickets. Do you know
what caught Timothy McVeigh?

20:49.115 --> 20:50.481
An expired license plate.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.650
I refuse to let this whole
fucking ship go down...

20:52.652 --> 20:54.118
Because you stole
a pair of panties.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.920
- Now give them to me.
- Take a look at this.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.321
- What?
- Look at this.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.626
- What the fuck is she doing?
- Maybe she has epilepsy.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.761
Alex, check Amy's...

21:03.763 --> 21:05.463
Background medical
just one more time.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.665
See if we overlooked some sort
of seizure disorder.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.733
Okay, on it.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.704
- We gotta do something.
- I don't see anything in here...

21:13.706 --> 21:15.773
About epilepsy
or a seizure disorder.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.876
It does say that she has
a severe peanut allergy.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.911
Oh, shit!

21:22.882 --> 21:24.148
What did I do?

21:24.150 --> 21:26.884
- You fed peanut butter...
- Oh.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.919
To the goddamn dog,

21:28.921 --> 21:32.623
and the dog licked her face!

21:32.625 --> 21:34.592
We gotta call 911.
She's dying.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.995
No, we can't call 911.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.764
- We can't call 911.
- Why not?

21:39.766 --> 21:41.766
Because we're not supposed
to be here, remember?

21:41.768 --> 21:43.634
We're supposed to be invisible.
We're nonexistent.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.003
Our cover would be blown.
The whole show would be blown.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.105
We've gotta think
of something else!

21:48.107 --> 21:50.241
Most people with severe peanut
allergies carry epi pens.

21:50.243 --> 21:52.410
Maybe I should run in there
and see if she's got one.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.245
I've got one!
I've got one!

21:54.247 --> 21:57.381
I have this major bee allergy.

21:57.383 --> 22:00.051
- Here.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:00.053 --> 22:01.986
You can't run in there
with a fucking epi pen.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.255
- That's tough to explain.
- Fuck it. I'm gonna save her.

22:04.257 --> 22:07.024
Hey, hey.
Shane, get back here!

22:07.026 --> 22:09.093
Shane, get back here!

22:16.302 --> 22:18.169
Who the fuck
called an ambulance?

22:18.171 --> 22:20.805
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

22:20.807 --> 22:22.440
<i>Hi, my name is Stacy Thorn.</i>

22:22.442 --> 22:24.408
<i>I think my friend's
having an allergic reaction.</i>

22:24.410 --> 22:26.877
<i>I just got off the phone with
her. She has a peanut allergy.</i>

22:26.879 --> 22:29.146
<i>It sounds like she's going
into anaphylactic shock.</i>

22:29.148 --> 22:31.028
<i>Help is en route.</i>

22:32.051 --> 22:33.951
- There she is.
- Oh!

22:33.953 --> 22:37.021
Hi! Oh, my baby!

22:44.497 --> 22:46.597
We lost blump's peanut butter.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.766
Leonard is not very happy.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.768
How the hell
was I supposed to know...

22:50.770 --> 22:53.104
That she was deathly allergic
to peanuts?

22:53.106 --> 22:56.340
You're supposed to know
everything they do, all right?

22:56.342 --> 22:58.342
Do you not have them under
all-encompassing surveillance?

22:58.344 --> 23:00.711
Yeah, well, that one
fell through the cracks.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.781
Well, my dear,
those cracks just cost us...

23:03.783 --> 23:06.083
Our biggest sponsor!

23:08.388 --> 23:11.555
Lupe, we were very,
very clear with you...

23:11.557 --> 23:13.557
When we first hired you
10 years ago.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.694
- Twelve. Twelve, honey.
- Twelve years ago.

23:16.696 --> 23:20.798
We told you that Amy has
a severe allergy to peanuts...

23:20.800 --> 23:23.467
And that you must never, ever
under any circumstance...

23:23.469 --> 23:25.436
Bring any item
into this house...

23:25.438 --> 23:28.773
That was made with
or of peanuts.

23:28.775 --> 23:31.308
<i>Sí, sí,</i> Mr. Dennis.
No peanuts.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.814
Well, what is this?

23:36.816 --> 23:40.217
<i>Pos...</i> No, no, Mr. Dennis.
Don't know.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.720
Lupe, there's no point in lying.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.955
We know that it was you
who brought the peanut butter.

23:44.957 --> 23:49.260
- It had to be you.
- No, Mr. Dennis. No, no, no.

23:49.262 --> 23:53.931
Me know that no buy
peanut butter. Makes Amy sick.

23:53.933 --> 23:57.234
No, no, lupe.
It doesn't just make her sick.

23:57.236 --> 24:00.037
Amy almost died.

24:00.039 --> 24:04.108
Lupe, you've really left us
with no other choice.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.279
We're going to have to
let you go.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.814
<i>Ay,</i> Mr. Dennis.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.782
We're gonna give you
two weeks' pay.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.951
We'll give you a good reference
if you need one,

24:13.953 --> 24:16.554
but beyond that we...
We really feel it's best...

24:16.556 --> 24:18.889
If we just terminate
this relationship.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.541
Oh...

24:39.745 --> 24:43.147
I feel terrible.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.850
Honey, she's like family.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.953
I feel terrible too.

24:50.223 --> 24:52.890
<i>It had to be done.</i>

25:27.793 --> 25:30.895
- What is this?
- What's going on?

25:30.897 --> 25:33.998
- What is this?
- A box of condoms?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.033
What were they doing
in your gym bag?

25:36.035 --> 25:38.936
- My gym bag?
- Yes, your gym bag.

25:38.938 --> 25:41.505
Why do you have a box of condoms
in your gym bag, Dennis?

25:41.507 --> 25:43.774
We haven't used condoms
for 25 years.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.944
I have no idea why there's
a box of condoms in my gym bag.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.313
You better do better than that.
I'm about to lose it right now.

25:49.315 --> 25:52.082
Why the fuck are you hiding a
box of condoms in your gym bag?

25:52.084 --> 25:54.418
Katherine. I swear to god.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.820
I swear on my mother's eyes
those are not my condoms.

25:56.822 --> 25:58.656
I have no idea
how they got there.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.057
Really. Really.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.826
So they walked by themselves
and landed in your gym bag.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.996
I have no idea how they got
into my gym bag!

26:07.233 --> 26:08.933
Wait a second.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.269
Those gotta be Craig's.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.972
- Who the hell is Craig?
- Craig sanderson from work.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.974
We work out at the office gym...

26:16.976 --> 26:18.509
At the same time in the morning.

26:18.511 --> 26:19.843
He's a total womanizer.

26:19.845 --> 26:21.545
Always talking about
his latest conquests.

26:21.547 --> 26:24.515
He must have put those
into my gym bag by mistake...

26:24.517 --> 26:26.383
- While we were getting dressed.
- Mmm.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.152
And you expect me
to believe that.

26:28.154 --> 26:30.588
You see, I watch way too much
daytime television...

26:30.590 --> 26:33.090
To be one of those
oblivious idiot housewives...

26:33.092 --> 26:35.359
Who choose to ignore
all the signals.

26:35.361 --> 26:38.262
Signals? What signals?

26:38.264 --> 26:40.998
Are you intimating
that I'm giving off...

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
All kinds of signals
that I'm a cheating husband?

26:43.002 --> 26:44.668
This is a really big
fucking signal!

26:44.670 --> 26:48.439
It's not just one lone condom.
It's a whole box full of them!

26:49.775 --> 26:51.909
Wait a second.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.978
I wish these were my condoms.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.713
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

26:55.715 --> 26:57.648
It means I wish
these were my condoms...

26:57.650 --> 27:00.217
Because read the goddamn label.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.686
Those condoms
are jumbo-sized.

27:02.688 --> 27:05.189
Do you really think that
if I was hiding condoms,

27:05.191 --> 27:07.057
I'd be using jumbo-sized?

27:07.059 --> 27:08.659
- Look what it says here!
- I see!

27:08.661 --> 27:10.995
"For penises
nine inches and larger."

27:10.997 --> 27:13.197
Does that sound like me to you?

27:15.434 --> 27:17.434
Nine inches or longer?

27:19.038 --> 27:21.605
- That guy Craig?
- Oh.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.607
I've seen him in the shower.

27:23.609 --> 27:25.776
Those are definitely
his condoms.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.345
Jesus.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.348
Slow push in.
Dramatic push in. Good.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.517
Nice. Nice.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.919
I love you...

27:35.921 --> 27:38.656
More than anyone
has loved anyone...

27:38.658 --> 27:40.157
Since they invented love.

27:41.527 --> 27:43.894
I'm sorry I jumped
to conclusions like that.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.563
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I-i...

27:46.565 --> 27:49.733
I understand.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.804
And just for the record,

27:53.806 --> 27:55.673
your penis is
the perfect size for me.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.595
I wouldn't want it
a hair bigger.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.091
All right.

28:14.093 --> 28:16.427
All right, boss.
Bam. Text away.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.178
All right,
so whatever I text now...

29:08.180 --> 29:12.249
Will come up on Mike's phone
as being from Stacy's number?

29:12.251 --> 29:13.484
Affirmative.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.544
God, oh, my god,
oh, my god, oh, my god!

29:40.546 --> 29:42.446
- Amy, what happened?
- Oh, my god!

29:42.448 --> 29:45.115
- What?
- I got into Harvard!

29:45.117 --> 29:47.284
Oh, ho! Ho...

29:50.790 --> 29:52.456
What about Amy's college fund?

29:52.458 --> 29:54.758
How much of that is gonna
cover her tuition?

29:54.760 --> 29:59.163
Well, if she gets into Harvard,
let's say,

30:00.432 --> 30:02.699
- it won't even cover half.
- What?

30:02.701 --> 30:04.835
We'll still have to
come up with 40 grand a year.

30:04.837 --> 30:07.371
Oh, my god.
What about student loans?

30:07.373 --> 30:09.339
She can get a student loan.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.508
We're right in the middle
of that catch-22 tax bracket...

30:11.510 --> 30:13.710
Where we do too well
to be eligible for much...

30:13.712 --> 30:17.214
And not well enough
to where it's not gonna hurt.

30:17.216 --> 30:20.083
Let me talk to Mr. stonecypher
about a raise.

30:20.085 --> 30:22.419
It's been too long anyhow.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.890
Mr. stonecypher...
Carl?

30:26.892 --> 30:28.926
I've been with the company
long enough...

30:28.928 --> 30:30.594
And I've proved myself
numerous times...

30:30.596 --> 30:33.463
Dennis, before you continue,
come on in. Have a seat.

30:33.465 --> 30:36.733
I've been meaning to talk to you
for the last couple of days,

30:36.735 --> 30:39.236
but I needed to get my facts
straight before I did.

30:39.238 --> 30:42.272
It's come to my attention
that there have been some, uh,

30:42.274 --> 30:44.708
discrepancies in some
of your work of late.

30:44.710 --> 30:47.778
- "Discrepancies"?
- I was surprised myself,

30:47.780 --> 30:50.280
because generally your work
is pretty spit-and-Polish,

30:50.282 --> 30:54.351
but a few of our clients
that you're on point for...

30:54.353 --> 30:55.953
Have contacted me
with some complaints...

30:55.955 --> 30:58.288
About errors in their books.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.456
That's impossible.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.125
Well, we had
a forensics accounting team...

31:02.127 --> 31:04.661
Do a complete audit
of the accounts in question,

31:04.663 --> 31:08.599
and, uh, well, there are some
pretty glaring faux pas.

31:15.341 --> 31:18.809
I have absolutely no idea
how this could have happened.

31:18.811 --> 31:21.778
I never let work go out
without triple-checking it.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.280
I don't understand this.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.815
Maybe there's a problem
with my computer...

31:24.817 --> 31:26.350
Or a glitch in the software.

31:26.352 --> 31:27.618
I'm mortified.

31:27.620 --> 31:30.520
What-what-what...
What can I do?

31:30.522 --> 31:33.223
- Fix it.
- Right, I... yes, sir.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.392
I will get on this right away.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.330
Oh, yeah, what did you
come in here to ask me?

31:40.332 --> 31:42.599
Uh...

31:42.601 --> 31:43.934
Nothing. Never mind.

31:43.936 --> 31:46.103
I'll get on this right away,
Mr. stonecypher.

31:52.177 --> 31:55.379
- Stacy, are you in here?
- Uh, yeah.

31:55.381 --> 31:58.148
Where have you been? I've been
looking everywhere for you.

31:58.150 --> 32:01.051
Sorry, Amy. Bad cramps today.
I've been really sick.

32:01.053 --> 32:03.387
Oh. Well, take it easy.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.522
No biggie.
Meet you on the field, okay?

32:05.524 --> 32:07.357
Oh, yeah, I'll be
coming in a minute.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.660
- You definitely will be.
- Huh?

32:09.662 --> 32:11.561
Nothing.
I didn't say anything.

32:11.563 --> 32:14.064
- All right. See you out there.
- All right. Thanks.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.266
That was a close one.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.502
Are we horrible people?

32:18.504 --> 32:21.071
What she doesn't know
will never hurt her.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.742
The show
is not dramatic enough.

32:25.744 --> 32:29.646
What happened to the dark and
secret lives these people lead?

32:29.648 --> 32:31.682
With all due respect,
we need a little more time...

32:31.684 --> 32:33.183
For the secrets to emerge.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.685
Okay, that's a problem,

32:34.687 --> 32:36.887
'cause we don't have
the luxury of time.

32:36.889 --> 32:38.488
This is television.
We need to start... uh!

32:38.490 --> 32:40.724
We need to start cutting promos
in the next month...

32:40.726 --> 32:42.059
To get these sponsors.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.127
No problem. Listen. We
promised you guys something...

32:44.129 --> 32:46.964
That's real human drama,
salacious and sexy,

32:46.966 --> 32:48.632
and that's exactly
what you're gonna get.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.634
Mickey's got three
different surveillance teams...

32:50.636 --> 32:52.669
Following these people 24/7.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.272
You're gonna get plenty
of material for the promos.

32:55.274 --> 32:56.914
Okay, now...

32:59.878 --> 33:01.712
Continuing with the basics.

33:01.714 --> 33:05.248
A roux is used
as the thickening agent...

33:05.250 --> 33:07.651
For three of the primary
mother sauces.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.721
Our <i> grand</i> sauce
in classical French cooking.

33:10.723 --> 33:13.023
And if you understand
how to make a good roux,

33:13.025 --> 33:14.424
you're halfway there.

33:14.426 --> 33:17.627
Now, today we're gonna
partner up into teams of two...

33:17.629 --> 33:19.229
To learn how to make the roux.

33:26.905 --> 33:28.638
Hmm.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.407
Very nice.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.175
Very nice blond roux.

33:32.177 --> 33:35.178
Wow.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.180
You really do know
what you're doing.

33:37.182 --> 33:41.518
So, if you already know how
to cook, what brings you here?

33:41.520 --> 33:43.920
Well, my wife got me
some cooking classes...

33:43.922 --> 33:46.089
As a 20th
wedding anniversary present.

33:46.091 --> 33:47.858
Actually, I think
it might have been...

33:47.860 --> 33:49.259
More of a present to herself.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.395
She loves to eat.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.997
Guess all the good ones
really are taken.

33:53.999 --> 33:56.233
Oh.

33:59.405 --> 34:03.407
Okay. Here we have the very tall
and delightful tiff wichmann.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.575
Okay. Next up we have
Francesca Corey.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.210
- Hi.
- This is Mickey Wagner.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.446
- Mickey, this is Zoe cozy.
- Pleased to meet you.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.748
Has anybody told you
what we're doing here?

34:11.750 --> 34:14.016
- Not really.
- Okay, it's a reality show.

34:14.018 --> 34:16.018
- Okay.
- It's like <i> the bachelor.</i>

34:16.021 --> 34:19.523
Girls competing for a guy,
but what's different here...

34:19.525 --> 34:21.658
Is that these girls
are competing...

34:21.659 --> 34:24.661
To try and get a married man
to have an affair.

34:24.663 --> 34:25.996
Oh, that's sexy.

34:25.998 --> 34:27.831
But he doesn't know that
he's on a reality show.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.533
- Oh.
- He's under surveillance,

34:29.534 --> 34:31.835
and these girls
are just flirting with him,

34:31.837 --> 34:34.404
and whoever can get him to cheat
on his wife first wins.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.906
- Okay?
- That's awesome.

34:35.908 --> 34:38.208
I have one more question. Uh...

34:38.210 --> 34:39.676
If I do get this part,

34:39.678 --> 34:42.344
and I'm the one that gets
this guy to cheat on his wife,

34:42.347 --> 34:44.214
do I actually
have to have sex with him?

34:44.216 --> 34:46.248
Well, we...
Well, yeah, of course.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.751
Is that a problem?

34:47.753 --> 34:50.053
Dennis!

34:50.054 --> 34:52.522
Nice meeting you.
See you next Saturday.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.257
Wait.
Oh, this is so embarrassing!

34:55.260 --> 34:59.029
My car won't start,
and my cell phone battery died,

34:59.031 --> 35:01.131
so I can't even call a cab.

35:01.133 --> 35:03.567
Do you think I could use yours
so I could call one?

35:03.569 --> 35:05.068
Sure.

35:05.070 --> 35:06.536
Thank you so much.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.839
I have to go all the way
to prospect heights.

35:08.841 --> 35:10.740
Prospect heights?
I live in prospect heights.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.442
- Get outta town!
- Yeah, hop in.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.945
- I'll give you a ride.
- Oh, well, thank you so much.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.646
- Sure.
- My hero.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.855
All right.

35:26.859 --> 35:30.460
I'm telling you, this was
the best anniversary gift...

35:30.462 --> 35:32.028
I've ever given you.

35:32.030 --> 35:34.598
- Dig in.
- Mmph.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.167
How was the class anyway?
Was it fun? Tell me.

35:37.169 --> 35:39.336
- It was great.
- Did you make any new friends?

35:41.707 --> 35:42.873
No.

35:44.776 --> 35:48.011
- Well, thank you so much again.
- You're welcome.

35:48.013 --> 35:50.580
- My knight in shining armor.
- Oh, please.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.749
Have a good night.

35:58.457 --> 36:00.290
Nobody in particular.

36:10.000 --> 36:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:27.286 --> 36:30.720
This is the part where
scholars and critics agree.

36:30.722 --> 36:35.992
This was frost's intent
is that it's about making...

36:35.994 --> 36:39.262
Personal choices, people,
and rationalizing. Yes.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.698
Mr. rudofsky,
can I use the restroom?

36:41.700 --> 36:42.700
Sure. Yeah.

36:51.510 --> 36:52.842
Hello?

37:46.531 --> 37:48.698
All right, stace,
what's so urgent...

37:48.700 --> 37:50.133
- Amy.
- Oh, my god.

37:50.135 --> 37:51.701
Amy.

37:51.703 --> 37:54.337
- What...
- This isn't what it looks like.

37:54.339 --> 37:56.039
Not what it looks like?

37:56.041 --> 37:58.742
My best friend
and my boyfriend are fucking.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.010
No, please let me explain.

38:00.012 --> 38:01.845
Why would you do this?

38:01.847 --> 38:03.613
Why would you text me
to come see this?

38:03.615 --> 38:06.983
Why would you do that?
Oh, my god!

38:28.640 --> 38:31.074
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

38:31.076 --> 38:33.143
is to make fast friends
with this Amy chick.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.744
Okay. So who is she?

38:34.746 --> 38:37.414
Well, she's a total square,
very goody-goody,

38:37.416 --> 38:38.782
but she's vulnerable.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.350
She's going through
a big heartbreak right now,

38:40.352 --> 38:42.218
and she's very susceptible
to a strong influence.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.586
That's where you come in.

38:43.588 --> 38:45.021
Take her for a walk
on the wild side?

38:45.023 --> 38:47.190
Exactly, but it's not
gonna be easy.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.825
This chick
has never had a drink,

38:48.827 --> 38:50.760
never smoked a cigarette,
never done a drug.

38:50.762 --> 38:51.995
She's never even had sex.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.930
I love it.
So who's in on it?

38:53.932 --> 38:55.598
Who knows I'm not a real
student in high school?

38:55.600 --> 38:58.168
Nobody knows,
and nobody can ever know.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.203
The students, the teachers,
the administrators...

39:00.205 --> 39:03.373
Everybody will believe you are
100% a real student.

39:03.375 --> 39:06.209
Holy shit!
Let me at her.

39:07.813 --> 39:10.480
Let's see
who's in the office here.

39:10.482 --> 39:12.716
Oh. Amy, are you busy?

39:12.718 --> 39:14.451
- No, Mr. gates.
- Oh, good.

39:14.453 --> 39:17.287
I'd like you to meet
Yvonne morticello.

39:17.289 --> 39:19.656
Yvonne is a new student
here at mid central.

39:19.658 --> 39:22.759
Amy, I'd like you to give
Yvonne the two-cent tour...

39:22.761 --> 39:24.627
Of our hallowed halls, please.

39:24.629 --> 39:25.862
- Happy to.
- Thank you.

39:25.864 --> 39:28.832
Which is relevant in that we...

39:28.834 --> 39:31.034
- Hi, Mr. rudofsky.
- Hello.

39:31.036 --> 39:34.938
This is one of our new students,
Yvonne morticello.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.040
This is Mr. rudofsky.
He teaches English.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.608
He's awesome.

39:39.611 --> 39:42.312
Soccer. I love soccer.

39:42.314 --> 39:44.080
Oh, my god. Me, too.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.082
I love to read.

39:46.084 --> 39:49.386
Oh, my god.
I love to read, too.

39:49.388 --> 39:51.721
So, this is the auditorium.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.724
Debates, plays...

39:56.561 --> 39:58.061
Yeah.

39:58.063 --> 40:00.230
Okay, come on. I'll show you
the football field.

40:00.232 --> 40:01.765
You okay?

40:03.568 --> 40:07.237
Yeah, I just don't really
like it in here right now.

40:07.239 --> 40:08.938
Um, just some bad memories.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.943
I won't pry, but you look just
like I did like a month ago...

40:13.945 --> 40:16.613
When I found out
my bitch of a best friend...

40:16.615 --> 40:19.682
And scum of a boyfriend were
hooking up behind my back.

40:19.684 --> 40:21.084
Lovely, right?

40:21.086 --> 40:23.787
Are you kidding me?

40:23.789 --> 40:27.757
That exact same thing
just happened to me.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.260
That's a really bizarre
coincidence.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.061
I don't believe in coincidences.

40:32.063 --> 40:33.763
I just believe in fate.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.799
Looks like I showed up
just in time.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.935
You and I need to have
a long chat.

40:45.544 --> 40:47.210
<i> Dennis?</i>

40:47.212 --> 40:50.480
<i>Mr. stonecypher would like
to see you in his office.</i>

40:50.482 --> 40:52.482
Did he say what...

41:02.928 --> 41:04.427
Mr. stonecy...

41:04.429 --> 41:06.963
Uh, Carl, you wanted to see me?

41:08.133 --> 41:10.700
Have a seat, Dennis.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.973
Dennis, I'm not good
at sugarcoating things,

41:16.975 --> 41:18.541
so I'm just gonna say it.

41:18.543 --> 41:20.543
I have to fire you.

41:22.614 --> 41:23.980
What?

41:27.419 --> 41:29.319
But I've been with this company
for more than...

41:29.321 --> 41:31.287
I know,
umpteen yadda-yadda years,

41:31.289 --> 41:33.289
and that's why I fought for you.

41:33.291 --> 41:35.291
But, uh, due to
your recent errors...

41:35.293 --> 41:37.327
But those are problems
with the computer.

41:37.329 --> 41:38.595
Irrelevant.

41:38.597 --> 41:42.332
Due to screw-ups
attributed to you,

41:42.334 --> 41:43.666
we just lost
the midline account.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.235
Oh, my god.

41:45.237 --> 41:46.903
Well, let me talk to them.

41:46.905 --> 41:48.938
I can clear it up
with one phone call.

41:48.940 --> 41:50.940
Are you kidding?
The ship has sailed.

41:50.942 --> 41:53.376
I gave you ample time
to fix the irregularities...

41:53.378 --> 41:54.711
With your software,

41:54.713 --> 41:57.514
but magically more discrepancies
keep popping up.

41:57.516 --> 41:59.182
But now my I.T. Guys
say that...

41:59.184 --> 42:00.984
There's nothing wrong
with your computer...

42:00.986 --> 42:03.520
Or your operating system
or your software.

42:03.522 --> 42:05.955
Now, the board of directors
told me I have to fire you,

42:05.957 --> 42:08.191
and that's what I'm doing.

42:08.193 --> 42:11.094
And I'm not happy about it,
Dennis.

42:11.096 --> 42:13.096
But I have no choice.

42:25.777 --> 42:27.176
Okay.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.092
Thank you.

42:50.402 --> 42:52.502
Dennis, what are you...
It-it's...

42:52.504 --> 42:55.805
It's dark out. What are you
doing home so late?

42:55.807 --> 42:57.407
Is everything okay?

42:59.010 --> 43:00.510
Honey?

43:02.147 --> 43:03.479
I was fired.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.417
What?

43:07.419 --> 43:09.052
I was just fired.

43:10.221 --> 43:13.556
Well, that's my cue. Um...

43:13.558 --> 43:17.360
You, uh... sounds like you guys
need a little family time.

43:17.362 --> 43:20.263
If you need me
for anything, just call.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.864
Sorry, Dennis.

43:27.138 --> 43:29.539
Oh, my god.
Honey, what happened?

43:33.111 --> 43:35.378
I'm sorry.

43:35.380 --> 43:38.748
Wha... oh.

43:38.750 --> 43:41.684
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my god. It's okay.

43:41.686 --> 43:44.787
I don't know what we're gonna...
What we're gonna do.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.055
It's okay.

43:48.093 --> 43:50.660
It's okay. It's okay.

43:50.662 --> 43:52.829
I don't know
what we're going to do.

44:00.905 --> 44:02.739
How's your show going?

44:02.741 --> 44:04.641
The show is actually
coming along pretty well.

44:04.643 --> 44:07.276
Some real human drama
is actually starting to unfold.

44:07.278 --> 44:09.145
<i>Amy and
her new friend Yvonne...</i>

44:09.147 --> 44:11.047
<i>Hit it off like gangbusters.</i>

44:11.049 --> 44:14.083
<i>Two peas in a pod. Turns out
they have a ton in common.</i>

44:14.085 --> 44:16.085
<i>Not just their likes
and their dislikes,</i>

44:16.087 --> 44:18.254
<i>but both having been betrayed
and heartbroken recently.</i>

44:18.256 --> 44:21.391
F-i-g-h-t.

44:21.393 --> 44:24.027
You can't lick the beavers!

44:24.029 --> 44:26.496
<i>Amy gave her Stacy's spot
on the cheerleader squad,</i>

44:26.498 --> 44:28.064
<i>and because Yvonne
is so beautiful,</i>

44:28.066 --> 44:31.134
<i>she instantly became
super popular at school,</i>

44:31.136 --> 44:32.635
<i>which drives Stacy crazy.</i>

44:32.637 --> 44:34.170
<i>Sucks to be her.</i>

44:34.172 --> 44:37.073
<i>And Mike still keeps trying
to get Amy back any way he can,</i>

44:37.075 --> 44:39.542
<i>but any time Amy seems
like she's gonna weaken,</i>

44:39.544 --> 44:41.644
<i>Yvonne is right there
to set her straight.</i>

44:41.646 --> 44:44.047
<i>Amy completely trusts Yvonne,
which is why Amy is starting...</i>

44:44.049 --> 44:46.482
<i>To do things
outside her comfort zone.</i>

44:46.484 --> 44:48.151
<i>Like the other day
when Yvonne convinced Amy...</i>

44:48.153 --> 44:49.619
<i>They should ditch school.</i>

44:49.621 --> 44:51.454
<i>Meanwhile,
since Dennis got fired,</i>

44:51.456 --> 44:53.856
<i>he's managed to get some
pretty high-profile meetings...</i>

44:53.858 --> 44:55.892
<i>At some really
top-notch companies.</i>

44:55.894 --> 44:57.727
You know, we do have
an immediate opening.

44:57.729 --> 44:59.595
<i>The meetings all seem
to go really, really well,</i>

44:59.597 --> 45:00.930
<i>but in the 11th hour,</i>

45:00.932 --> 45:02.932
<i>something always seems
to go south.</i>

45:02.934 --> 45:04.133
Carl stonecypher, please.

45:04.135 --> 45:06.369
This is Elaine margolis
from fgb.

45:06.371 --> 45:08.131
<i>Hold, please.</i>

45:10.575 --> 45:12.175
Uh, Carl stonecypher.

45:12.177 --> 45:13.743
Good afternoon.

45:13.745 --> 45:15.678
I'm calling because
you're listed as a reference...

45:15.680 --> 45:17.747
On Dennis Warwick's resume.

45:17.749 --> 45:20.883
Your letter of recommendation
was beyond glowing, and I...

45:20.885 --> 45:22.885
<i>Dennis never seems
to be able to close the deal...</i>

45:22.887 --> 45:24.454
<i>For some reason,</i>

45:24.456 --> 45:26.723
<i>leaving him
perpetually unemployed.</i>

45:26.725 --> 45:29.425
You should know
that my legal team...

45:29.427 --> 45:33.196
<i>Forced me to begrudgingly write
that letter of reference.</i>

45:33.198 --> 45:35.898
I should tell you that
i personally had to fire...

45:35.900 --> 45:39.335
<i>Mr. Warwick for some
pretty egregious grievances.</i>

45:39.337 --> 45:41.504
Oh. I see.

45:41.506 --> 45:43.306
<i>And then
to complicate matters at home,</i>

45:43.308 --> 45:44.941
<i>there's all these women.</i>

45:44.943 --> 45:46.809
Do these look ripe to you?

45:46.811 --> 45:49.312
I mean, how do you know?

45:49.314 --> 45:50.813
Do you squeeze 'em?

45:50.815 --> 45:53.349
Well, you just, uh...

45:53.351 --> 45:55.918
- You do what?
- You wanna smell the button.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.286
- Oh.
- Oh.

45:57.288 --> 45:59.088
Sorry. I didn't mean
to touch your melon.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.990
- Was it like that?
- Hey.

46:00.992 --> 46:03.059
Oh, well, thank you, Dennis.

46:03.061 --> 46:04.961
Nice to meet you, um...

46:04.963 --> 46:06.062
Women are finding him
attractive...

46:06.064 --> 46:07.430
And flirting with him,

46:07.432 --> 46:09.365
<i>and it's making his wife
very suspicious.</i>

46:09.367 --> 46:12.468
<i>Not only that, but Katherine
is starting to show signs...</i>

46:12.470 --> 46:15.271
<i>That she's unsatisfied
with their sex life.</i>

46:15.273 --> 46:16.706
Wow.

46:16.708 --> 46:19.542
Wow, that sounds pretty good.
You said they were boring.

46:19.544 --> 46:22.245
Sounds like a little mini soap
opera is starting to play out.

46:22.247 --> 46:23.446
It's getting there.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.281
The network won't stop
breathing down my neck.

46:25.283 --> 46:27.183
Just give me
a little more time, okay?

46:27.185 --> 46:29.719
My gentle nudging has planted
some real seeds here.

46:29.721 --> 46:33.356
- There is no more time.
- Step it up. Add more conflict.

46:33.358 --> 46:36.926
They want more conflict? Fine.
I'll give 'em more conflict.

46:39.297 --> 46:41.030
Thank you again for the ride.

46:41.032 --> 46:43.166
My car should be ready
by next week.

46:43.168 --> 46:45.168
Happy to oblige.

46:45.170 --> 46:47.403
Dennis, I know
you've been generous...

46:47.405 --> 46:49.705
In giving me another ride home,

46:49.707 --> 46:52.875
but could you maybe do me
just one more small favor?

46:52.877 --> 46:56.646
Uh, yeah, sure.
What is it?

46:57.949 --> 47:00.116
The electricity's been out
in the building,

47:00.118 --> 47:02.118
and I'm just a little scared...

47:02.120 --> 47:05.121
Walking into
the apartment alone.

47:05.123 --> 47:07.423
All the friends I'm staying with
are out of town.

47:10.228 --> 47:11.861
Please.

47:12.931 --> 47:14.997
Wow, you're not kidding.

47:14.999 --> 47:18.067
- It is spooky in here.
- It's an old building,

47:18.069 --> 47:19.936
and they're rewiring
the whole place.

47:19.938 --> 47:23.439
They said it'd be done
by tonight, but as you can see...

47:25.009 --> 47:27.043
She's good, she's good,
she's good.

47:27.045 --> 47:29.312
See, I told you. I told you
she was the good one.

47:29.314 --> 47:31.480
Dennis...

47:31.482 --> 47:34.217
Is it bad if I confess
something to you?

47:34.219 --> 47:37.286
Oh, I don't know. I guess
it depends on what it is.

47:37.288 --> 47:39.722
I mean, if you're gonna
confess to a mass killing spree,

47:39.724 --> 47:41.891
then probably, yeah.

47:41.893 --> 47:44.093
You're funny.

47:44.095 --> 47:45.695
Seriously, though.

47:45.697 --> 47:50.433
Is it bad if I confess
that I like you?

47:50.435 --> 47:53.436
Oh, well, uh...

47:53.438 --> 47:55.137
I like you, too, Francesca.

47:55.139 --> 47:57.573
You're a great cooking partner.

47:57.575 --> 47:59.275
No.

47:59.277 --> 48:01.410
I <i> like</i> you.

48:01.412 --> 48:05.715
I know you're married and all,
but I can't help how I feel.

48:05.717 --> 48:07.216
Is that bad?

48:07.218 --> 48:08.718
Um...

48:08.720 --> 48:12.521
Well, um, I don't think
it's bad to have...

48:12.523 --> 48:14.590
When I first got dumped
by my ex,

48:14.592 --> 48:17.627
I never thought I could ever
be attracted to anyone again.

48:17.629 --> 48:20.429
Well, uh,
f-f-f-Fran-Francesca...

48:20.431 --> 48:23.232
Shh. Can I tell you
a secret?

48:23.234 --> 48:24.533
Okay.

48:24.535 --> 48:26.736
There's no problem with my car.

48:27.839 --> 48:30.339
I just wanted you
to give me a ride home.

48:31.542 --> 48:33.943
- Oh.
- Dennis?

48:33.945 --> 48:35.745
Yeah.

48:35.747 --> 48:37.813
I want you.

48:37.815 --> 48:39.415
Francesca!

48:39.417 --> 48:41.951
This is all
very flattering, but I...

48:41.953 --> 48:43.953
I'm a happily married man.

48:43.955 --> 48:46.122
I know you're going
through a lot,

48:46.124 --> 48:48.057
and I'm going through
a lot, too,

48:48.059 --> 48:50.326
but this is no way for us
to solve our problems.

48:50.328 --> 48:53.195
This is just an invitation
to more problems.

48:53.197 --> 48:55.998
Listen, I've got to get going.

49:00.371 --> 49:01.904
Je... good-bye.

49:05.510 --> 49:07.343
What the fuck?

49:07.345 --> 49:09.345
High-five for not cheating
on your wife.

49:09.347 --> 49:10.513
Come on.

49:10.515 --> 49:12.748
High-five for not cheating
on your wife.

49:12.750 --> 49:15.084
What the fuck
is wrong with this guy?

49:15.086 --> 49:17.653
It definitely does not make
for good television...

49:17.655 --> 49:20.022
When a husband
refuses to cheat on his wife...

49:20.024 --> 49:22.191
With a series
of gorgeous supermodels.

49:22.193 --> 49:24.427
I figured since Dennis
refused to cheat,

49:24.429 --> 49:26.796
maybe we could see
if we could get...

49:26.798 --> 49:27.964
Katherine to cheat.

49:29.033 --> 49:30.766
- I know that, uh, women are...
- Voila.

49:30.768 --> 49:34.003
Statistically four times
less likely to cheat,

49:34.005 --> 49:36.439
or something like that,
but I figure...

49:36.441 --> 49:38.174
I figure it's worth a shot.

49:38.176 --> 49:41.811
Yeah, I like it. The bored
suburban housewife angle.

49:41.813 --> 49:44.647
Actually, I like it, too, and i
actually think she might do it.

49:44.649 --> 49:46.182
- Great.
- 'Cause she's gotta be...

49:46.184 --> 49:47.683
Sexually frustrated
at this point.

49:47.685 --> 49:50.052
She's only ever been
with Mr. 17-second man.

49:50.054 --> 49:53.055
- Don't knock 17 seconds.
- Ooh, the poor thing.

49:53.057 --> 49:55.057
Who are you thinking
of using as bait?

49:55.593 --> 49:57.460
I've rubbed your naked body.

49:57.462 --> 49:59.362
I beg your pardon.

49:59.364 --> 50:01.831
Uh, Mrs. Warwick, right?

50:01.833 --> 50:03.165
Do I know you?

50:03.167 --> 50:05.935
Uh, Chad.
I was your masseuse.

50:05.937 --> 50:08.704
I work at that spa in the mall.
Salutations, remember?

50:08.706 --> 50:11.440
Oh, my god! Ha.
I remember you.

50:12.643 --> 50:14.243
Salutations.

50:14.245 --> 50:17.213
I'm Chad. I'll be giving you
your massage today.

50:17.215 --> 50:19.115
I'm so sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

50:19.117 --> 50:21.117
- It's not a problem.
- You're not in your uniform.

50:21.119 --> 50:23.085
It an out-of-context
kind of thing.

50:23.087 --> 50:26.922
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm-I'm good. How are you?

50:26.924 --> 50:29.959
I am fantastic, actually.
Thank you for asking.

50:29.961 --> 50:32.395
Well, cheers to that.
Really.

50:32.397 --> 50:34.463
- Yeah.
- So are you, um...

50:34.465 --> 50:36.032
You coming from the gym?

50:36.034 --> 50:39.502
I am training for another
ironman, as a matter of fact.

50:39.504 --> 50:41.804
I gotta get a couple bananas,
make a smoothie,

50:41.806 --> 50:43.606
and then I'm off
to work, actually.

50:43.608 --> 50:45.307
- Wow.
- You should come back in.

50:45.309 --> 50:46.876
I can get you a family rate.

50:46.878 --> 50:49.178
Oh, wow.
Uh, that sounds great.

50:49.180 --> 50:52.481
I... I could actually use
another massage.

50:52.483 --> 50:54.917
This is my card.
I also do house calls.

50:54.919 --> 50:57.486
It's not affiliated
with the spa, but, uh,

50:57.488 --> 50:59.388
my cell's on the back.

50:59.390 --> 51:01.090
Give me a call.

51:01.092 --> 51:03.359
I have to go. I'm off.

51:03.361 --> 51:05.161
But I'll see you later,
Mrs. Warwick.

51:05.163 --> 51:07.930
Uh, k-Kat... Katherine.
You can...

51:07.932 --> 51:09.852
- Katherine.
- Call me Katherine.

51:40.965 --> 51:44.133
That's what
I'm talkin' about, g!

51:44.135 --> 51:47.870
Yes! Okay!

51:47.872 --> 51:50.673
- Okay. Hey.
- Congrats, Mickey.

51:50.675 --> 51:52.808
- We're back on track.
- Thanks, boys.

51:55.513 --> 51:57.213
Lindsey, of course.

51:58.282 --> 52:00.449
Holy yuck.
What did you put in there?

52:00.451 --> 52:02.551
Shh! It's Tequila.

52:02.553 --> 52:04.954
Well, it's disgusting.
You know I don't drink.

52:04.956 --> 52:06.589
Well, you know
i don't drink either,

52:06.591 --> 52:09.592
but I have a shot now and then
to help me get over my ex...

52:09.594 --> 52:11.193
A heck of a lot quicker.

52:14.132 --> 52:16.765
Oh, come on.
It's no big deal.

52:18.369 --> 52:21.103
Don't let Mike be the one
to have all the fun.

52:25.243 --> 52:26.742
Screw it.

52:34.852 --> 52:36.952
Amy, this is ridiculous.

52:36.954 --> 52:38.754
We've been best friends
since we were three.

52:38.756 --> 52:40.856
Can we at least
talk about this, please?

52:40.858 --> 52:42.925
Do you smell something?

52:42.927 --> 52:47.396
Something stinks like...
Hot garbage.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.068
Amy, please, come here.
Just for a minute.

52:53.070 --> 52:55.004
What, you don't have
a mind of your own anymore?

52:55.006 --> 52:57.072
You gotta look to her?

52:57.074 --> 53:00.242
I'm gonna go to class.
See you next Tuesday.

53:03.381 --> 53:05.181
Listen, I know you hate my guts.

53:05.183 --> 53:07.583
I don't blame you.
I hate my guts, too.

53:07.585 --> 53:10.085
But I at least wanted
to tell you I feel...

53:10.087 --> 53:13.189
So unbelievably terrible
about what I did.

53:13.191 --> 53:15.658
I take full responsibility
and I'd gladly...

53:15.660 --> 53:17.826
Devote my life
to doing whatever it takes...

53:17.828 --> 53:20.362
To make things okay
between us again.

53:21.399 --> 53:24.633
I miss you.
Aimsie-waymsie.

53:34.812 --> 53:36.345
Fight! Fight! Fight!

53:39.116 --> 53:41.050
Oh!

53:48.459 --> 53:50.392
Oh!

53:51.696 --> 53:53.429
Oh, my god.

53:57.635 --> 53:59.902
Amy, your behavior
in the hallway...

53:59.904 --> 54:01.937
Was so public
and so abhorrent...

54:01.939 --> 54:04.340
That I really have no choice
but to punish you...

54:04.342 --> 54:06.375
In the same way
i would any other student.

54:06.377 --> 54:09.311
- I can't play favorites.
- We understand.

54:09.313 --> 54:11.113
Amy will be suspended
for three days.

54:11.115 --> 54:12.648
What?

54:15.586 --> 54:17.720
She had alcohol on her breath?

54:18.823 --> 54:21.357
Oh, my god.
I'm in a state of shock.

54:21.359 --> 54:25.227
She's lucky the school only
gave her three days, Dennis.

54:25.229 --> 54:27.997
We cannot let her think that
this behavior is acceptable.

54:27.999 --> 54:31.100
- I'm so sorry, ame.
- It's not your fault.

54:31.102 --> 54:34.203
I just went crazy.
I don't know what came over me.

54:34.205 --> 54:37.006
It would have been more crazy
not to have done what you did.

54:37.008 --> 54:39.008
Anyways, I gotta go, but, um,

54:39.010 --> 54:40.809
use this down time
to decompress.

54:40.811 --> 54:45.047
Just think of it like
a mini... stay-cation.

54:45.049 --> 54:48.050
Oh, and if you find yourself
being too stressed or anxious,

54:48.052 --> 54:50.819
I left you some medicine in the
side pocket of your backpack.

54:52.123 --> 54:53.222
Medicine?

54:53.224 --> 54:55.391
Good night, sweet cheeks.
Mwah.

55:02.967 --> 55:05.701
Yvonne, you're crazy.

55:22.753 --> 55:24.593
Off you yoga class!

55:33.464 --> 55:35.564
I don't care
if it's flipping burgers!

55:35.566 --> 55:38.267
I don't care
if it's shoveling dog shit!

55:38.269 --> 55:40.602
I don't care if it's
wearing a fucking sandwich!

55:40.604 --> 55:43.472
You need to get your sad sack
self out of this house...

55:43.474 --> 55:44.873
And get a fucking job, okay?

55:44.875 --> 55:46.942
Or you're gonna be sleeping
on the couch!

55:46.944 --> 55:51.213
- This is fucking humiliating!
- Humiliating for you?

55:51.215 --> 55:53.849
Don't you think
it's humiliating for me?

55:53.851 --> 55:57.720
I tried to get a job bagging
groceries, for god sakes!

55:57.722 --> 55:59.121
They wouldn't hire me!

55:59.123 --> 56:01.623
I have no idea
what's going on here.

56:01.625 --> 56:04.026
- What, do I have leprosy?
- I don't know,

56:04.028 --> 56:06.095
but fucking figure it out!

56:07.498 --> 56:08.831
Fuck!

56:12.937 --> 56:15.404
Great yoga class today.

56:17.608 --> 56:19.341
Good craft fair today.

56:21.445 --> 56:23.579
Great spinning class today.

56:25.716 --> 56:29.151
<i>Okay, so tell me.
Are you having an affair?</i>

56:29.153 --> 56:31.854
- Why would you say that?
- Because look at you.

56:31.856 --> 56:34.223
You've never been happier.
You've never looked better.

56:34.225 --> 56:37.459
Is it obvious? If you look
at me, you can actually tell?

56:37.461 --> 56:38.794
Are you?

56:38.796 --> 56:40.362
Tell me.

56:40.364 --> 56:42.364
I think I'm in love with him.

56:42.366 --> 56:45.768
Wait a minute. You're having
an affair? I knew it!

56:45.770 --> 56:48.203
No, I don't
just mean I'm-I'm...

56:48.205 --> 56:51.140
I think I'm really
in love with the man.

56:51.142 --> 56:52.908
I would be, too.
Are you kidding?

56:52.910 --> 56:56.445
Who wouldn't want to be ravaged
by that gorgeous stud?

56:56.447 --> 56:58.013
Throw him my way...

56:58.015 --> 56:59.882
- When you're tired of him.
- Okay, you know what?

56:59.884 --> 57:02.050
I shouldn't have told you.

57:02.052 --> 57:03.786
I'm not just in love
with the sex.

57:03.788 --> 57:06.021
- I think I'm in love with him.
- Katherine.

57:06.023 --> 57:08.891
- What?
- Don't be naive.

57:08.893 --> 57:11.727
Come on. This is the first time
in your life...

57:11.729 --> 57:14.730
You're legitimately
being fucked.

57:14.732 --> 57:17.766
You're not in love.
You're in lust.

57:17.768 --> 57:21.003
And by the way, who cares?
Have fun.

57:23.040 --> 57:26.241
I never knew what sex was
before Chad, okay?

57:27.778 --> 57:30.612
I certainly never had an orgasm.

57:30.614 --> 57:32.648
- Can't believe I just said that.
- Oh, my god!

57:32.650 --> 57:34.149
- Are you kidding?
- Uh-uh.

57:34.151 --> 57:36.418
- Nope.
- Oh, you poor thing.

57:36.420 --> 57:38.754
For 20 years,
I've been married to a man...

57:38.756 --> 57:41.323
Who never put a shred of effort
into our sex life.

57:41.325 --> 57:42.825
Mmm.

57:42.827 --> 57:45.994
I never knew what I was missing.

57:45.996 --> 57:48.831
Now I'm like a blind person
who can suddenly see.

57:48.833 --> 57:50.365
For god's sake.

57:50.367 --> 57:52.367
Oh.

57:54.238 --> 57:56.238
I never knew
what a sex life could be.

57:58.175 --> 58:00.876
And now that I do, it has me...

58:00.878 --> 58:02.544
It has me very angry.

58:05.015 --> 58:06.515
I'll be home late.

58:06.517 --> 58:08.217
Excuse me. Where do you think
you're going, young lady?

58:08.219 --> 58:10.152
Have you forgotten
you're still grounded?

58:10.154 --> 58:12.221
I thought I was only grounded
through my suspension.

58:12.223 --> 58:15.390
No, you're grounded
until further notice.

58:15.392 --> 58:17.526
Well, that's not fair.

58:17.528 --> 58:19.928
I'm sorry. What does fair
have to do with it?

58:19.930 --> 58:22.331
Amy, don't back-talk
your mother like that, okay?

58:22.333 --> 58:24.666
I'm not back-talking. I'm just
saying that it's not fair.

58:24.668 --> 58:27.169
I feel like if the school's
forgiven me, my parents do, too.

58:27.171 --> 58:29.238
Just stop right there!
You keep this up...

58:29.240 --> 58:32.407
We took away your credit card.
We took away your car.

58:32.409 --> 58:33.842
I'm gonna take away your phone.

58:33.844 --> 58:36.111
- What?
- Who you going out with?

58:36.113 --> 58:39.348
I was gonna go pick up Yvonne,
but I don't have a car anymore.

58:39.350 --> 58:41.216
We were gonna go
to that French restaurant.

58:41.218 --> 58:43.519
Oh, the French restaurant.

58:43.521 --> 58:45.521
Have you forgotten
your father's out of work?

58:45.523 --> 58:48.023
And again with
this Yvonne morticello.

58:48.025 --> 58:49.725
- Is that the troublemaker?
- Yup.

58:49.727 --> 58:52.127
You guys don't even know
what you're talking about, okay?

58:52.129 --> 58:53.795
You don't even know her.

58:53.797 --> 58:55.664
She's the only person
who's been there for me...

58:55.666 --> 58:57.165
Through this Stacy
and Mike nightmare.

58:57.167 --> 59:00.435
Well, good for you. You can see
her when you're not grounded.

59:00.437 --> 59:03.572
And you know what? Enough of
this Mike and Stacy situation.

59:03.574 --> 59:05.140
I'm sick of it!

59:05.142 --> 59:07.476
For god's sake,
you don't have cancer...

59:07.478 --> 59:09.011
And you're not homeless.

59:09.013 --> 59:11.713
There are people out there with
a lot more problems than you.

59:11.715 --> 59:13.849
So just get over
your little pity party, okay?

59:13.851 --> 59:15.784
- I cannot believe you two!
- Get over it!

59:15.786 --> 59:17.653
- Who are you? Ugh!

59:17.655 --> 59:19.454
Get upstairs and stay up there!

59:31.235 --> 59:34.169
You don't think we're being
a little too hard on her?

59:34.171 --> 59:36.672
Dennis, no, we need to nip this
in the bud right now!

59:36.674 --> 59:38.907
No matter how much it hurts us.

59:38.909 --> 59:42.778
We-we... we need to show her
that she can't act this way.

59:42.780 --> 59:45.914
If we just do this right,
we play our cards right,

59:45.916 --> 59:49.117
she will never make
these mistakes again.

59:57.695 --> 01:00:01.029
I hate you!

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:07.235
I hate you!

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:11.506
I hate you!
I hate you!

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:32.894
- Wake up, loser.
- I'm up.

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:36.098
What... where are you?
It's, like, almost midnight.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.933
I'm outside your house.

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:39.835
Come on. I got some more fun
for us to go.

01:00:39.837 --> 01:00:43.572
You mean, like, sneak out?

01:00:43.574 --> 01:00:45.774
Uh, of course I mean sneak out.

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:49.444
Come on. Your parents will never
find out. I promise.

01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:51.713
- I can't.
- You can.

01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:54.082
I'll have you back
in a couple of hours, tops.

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:56.084
They'll never be the wiser.

01:00:58.188 --> 01:00:59.521
I can't.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:03.025
This is so insane.

01:01:03.027 --> 01:01:05.327
I'm so freaking out.
I'm excited.

01:01:08.732 --> 01:01:11.066
<i> Ah!</i>

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:13.101
All right, here we are.

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:16.471
Where are we?
This place is shady.

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:19.007
This fat creep ed-e's place.

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:21.009
I just need to get
some quick cash...

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:24.112
So we can get into the club.

01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:26.715
You're not gonna have sex with
somebody for money, are you?

01:01:26.717 --> 01:01:30.218
Are you crazy?
Ugh. I would never do that.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.887
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, ugly.

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:33.388
It's Yvonne and friend.

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.757
<i>It's about damn time.
Come on up.</i>

01:01:39.563 --> 01:01:42.664
It's late, Yvonne.

01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:44.866
I didn't think
you were gonna show up.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.568
This is my bff, Amy.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.271
- Nice to meet you, Amy.
- Hi, ed-e.

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:52.574
Well, you're a pretty
young thing. She's cute.

01:01:52.576 --> 01:01:55.077
You creep-o.
Don't get any ideas.

01:01:55.079 --> 01:01:57.179
Amy's a good little girl.

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:59.481
She'd never do this
in a million years.

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:00.849
Do what?

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:02.751
Ed-e's got
this skeevy little web site...

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:04.252
Where he takes naked pictures...

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:06.188
Of the girls he meets
along his travels.

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:09.758
Naked pictures for the Internet?

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.127
Relax.
My face will be covered.

01:02:12.129 --> 01:02:14.196
He pays great
for a few quick shots.

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:16.298
It's actually
a Russian web site.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.467
It's only seen in Russian.
It's not seen in America at all.

01:02:18.469 --> 01:02:20.268
But in case a girl
feels uncomfortable,

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:23.205
I let her cover her face
with a towel so she's incognito.

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:24.973
- So...
- You do this a lot?

01:02:24.975 --> 01:02:29.377
Of course. How else do you think
i afford these fabulous shoes?

01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:33.014
So, let me get you a drink.
Okay? Both you guys.

01:02:33.016 --> 01:02:34.583
All right?

01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:37.252
And you could sit right here
and relax...

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.954
And, uh, and watch.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:41.456
It only takes a few minutes.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.862
Made yours a little weaker.

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:50.232
Here you go, honey.

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:53.368
Suck it in.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.537
Nice. There you go.

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:57.579
That's it. Perfect.
Okay, lean back more.

01:02:58.675 --> 01:03:00.308
Nice, nice.

01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:05.046
Turn around.
Do some doggy shots.

01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:08.216
Sexy body, huh?
You don't think so?

01:03:08.218 --> 01:03:09.518
Ass up in the air.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.386
Okay. Hold it.

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:13.221
Put the boob up there like that.
That's okay.

01:03:13.223 --> 01:03:15.957
We see a nice little hang.
Nice natural boobies.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:19.227
We like natural boobies.
That's it. That's the shot!

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:21.229
Beautiful. One.

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:24.065
And that's it. We are done!

01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:25.567
But hold on a minute.

01:03:25.569 --> 01:03:28.003
If you wanna go without the
towel so I can see your face,

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:30.472
- I'll pay you more money.
- Yeah?

01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:33.408
- How much more?
- Instead of getting $100,

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:36.878
- I'll give you $500.
- $500?

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.815
You swear no one in America
will ever see these?

01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:42.350
It's a Russian web site.
It's even spoken in Russian.

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:44.319
You can't even Google this
here in America.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:47.222
Fuck it. Why not?

01:03:47.224 --> 01:03:49.391
Wait. You swear?

01:03:49.393 --> 01:03:52.794
On my mother's eyes.
Hold this.

01:03:52.796 --> 01:03:54.529
All right. I'm gonna need
another drink for this.

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:55.864
Pour some more shots?

01:03:55.866 --> 01:03:57.866
One, two, three.

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:01.970
Perfect. Beautiful.

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:06.741
Beautiful.
The whole shot's great.

01:04:06.743 --> 01:04:09.477
And just do a little spread
right there. Suck it in.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:10.979
Okay, legs a little bit apart.

01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:12.447
That's the shot. Beautiful.

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:14.082
Turn around.
We'll do some doggy shots.

01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:16.218
Boobies. Booby. Nice.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.220
That's it. Perfect. Don't move.

01:04:19.957 --> 01:04:23.058
- Done. Who's next?
- No. No, no, no, no.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:26.461
She'll never do this.
She's going to Harvard.

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:30.065
I've shot girls that went
to Harvard, Yale, Stanford.

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:32.100
Tuition is very expensive.

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:34.236
Ed-e, don't even go there.

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:36.271
Let her speak for herself.

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:39.241
Honey, would you like to make
a little extra spending money?

01:04:40.611 --> 01:04:42.544
- I don't...
- Before you give me an answer,

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.746
since you're new...
You're not a model by trade...

01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:46.248
I'll give you a little bonus.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:49.384
I could start you out at $1,000.

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:53.054
- $1,000?
- Oh, not enough?

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:55.523
I'll give you $1,500.

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:59.961
Ed-e, you're wasting your time.
Amy's a virgin.

01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:02.030
She's saving everything
for her wedding night.

01:05:04.034 --> 01:05:08.603
Wai-wait a second.
You're a virgin?

01:05:08.605 --> 01:05:11.973
A virgin in my business is more
of an endangered species...

01:05:11.975 --> 01:05:15.443
Than a black sumatran rhino
is to the world.

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:18.380
Well, how about, miss virgin,

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:22.250
I give you $2,500?

01:05:25.856 --> 01:05:29.557
- $2,500?
- Mm-hmm. Come on, sweetie.

01:05:29.559 --> 01:05:31.793
You only live once, you know?
Come on. Sit over here, honey.

01:05:31.795 --> 01:05:34.095
You go switch places here.
You come here, honey.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.131
She'll hold your money for you.

01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:37.799
- I'm freaking out.
- Don't worry about it.

01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:41.803
Come on, sweetie.
Tuition, expenses.

01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:44.839
Food in the cafeteria.

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:50.345
Will you help me here?

01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:53.982
Best job I ever had.

01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:56.751
Pretty fast, huh?
Haven't lost it, have I?

01:05:56.753 --> 01:05:58.086
- You're hot.
- Thanks.

01:05:58.088 --> 01:06:00.048
Thank you.
What do you think of her?

01:06:00.991 --> 01:06:02.123
Stand up. Let's go.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.491
I want to try you standing.
Nice.

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:05.293
Oh, let's see a little cleavage.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:06.728
Right there.
Right there!

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:08.430
That's it. Don't move. Good.

01:06:08.432 --> 01:06:09.764
Oh, your underpants, honey.

01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:12.133
All right. Good girl.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.669
Show off the booby.
There you go. Perfect.

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:16.004
This is really nice.

01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:18.126
Right there. So you see it.
Let me see booby.

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:23.144
Let's see the tushy.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:25.947
Let's see your tush.
Okay. Right there. Okay.

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:31.453
Okay, lie back.

01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:33.655
Little bit apart.
There you go. That's it.

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:35.690
Actually, put it on the sofa.
Perfect.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:38.293
Okay. That's great.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.700
Now, I gotta see
one little kiss.

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:59.941
- Sharon's ready for you guys.
- Oh, who is Sharon?

01:07:59.943 --> 01:08:02.610
Who's Sharon? Sharon's the new
head of the network, okay?

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:05.013
- Leonard was shit-canned.
- Leonard got fired?

01:08:05.015 --> 01:08:07.248
Dude, get your head
out of your ass. Game face.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.250
Okay. Hi there.
Thank you.

01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:13.688
We've seen all the rough cuts.
We've watched all the footage.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.723
And we really like the show.

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:18.792
I mean, we're really happy
with the direction it's heading.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:23.131
Music from heaven.

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:27.569
Does this guy
know what he is doing, or what?

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:30.839
We do have one little tiny note.
We need a happy ending.

01:08:30.841 --> 01:08:32.506
- A happy ending?
- Yeah.

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:34.042
It's just too depressing.

01:08:34.044 --> 01:08:36.211
Look, the audience wants to go
on a roller-coaster ride.

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:38.746
But ultimately, they want
to know that everything...

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:41.282
Is safe and sound and in its
place at the end of the day.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:43.718
- Hmm.
- What you have right now...

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.487
You've got
an out-of-work husband,

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:47.354
a wife who cheats,

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:49.823
a daughter
who's completely out of control.

01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:52.093
You have to bring them
back together.

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:55.763
I mean, I don't know,
some unifying event. Right?

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:58.166
Something that they care
equally about,

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.767
that they could get
passionate about,

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:01.836
excited about,
forget about their problems.

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:05.140
And reunite in some emotionally
satisfying climax.

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:08.109
I don't care what the event is.
I won't decide that for you.

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:10.578
I'm gonna leave that up to you
and your team of writers.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.081
- Great.
- So look. Here's the deal.

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:16.484
Once everything's in the can
and we're ready to go to air,

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:19.354
we've decided that <i> the womanizer</i>
will be the show's lead-in.

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:24.158
Oh...
I get a little excited.

01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:27.795
That's the network's
biggest show right now.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:28.962
Guys...

01:09:28.965 --> 01:09:30.298
<i> All right.</i>

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:33.001
Think, think, think. Ideas.
Come on. Be creative.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:35.737
We need one unifying event,
something that will...

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:38.006
Make the warwicks
forget about their problems...

01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:40.108
And come together as a family.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.343
We could get Dennis's job back.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:45.479
No, that's not very
emotionally charged.

01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:48.983
Nobody's gonna cry over a guy
getting his accountant job back.

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:51.953
- Keep thinking, keep thinking.
- What if Amy got sick?

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:54.522
Rallying around a sick kid
in the hospital.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.891
- That's tear-jerky.
- Sick with what?

01:09:56.893 --> 01:09:58.193
I don't know. Cancer?

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:03.264
Cancer.

01:10:03.266 --> 01:10:05.867
Just get Amy sick with cancer.

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:07.969
Just make her get cancer.

01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:10.000
You can't just somebody
with a fucking cancer gun!

Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:14.042
We can shoot someone
with a real gun.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:16.144
Like stage
a carjacking or something.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:16.146 --> 01:10:18.446
- Possible.
- The dog.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:22.000
- We're not shooting the dog.
- No, don't shoot the dog.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:22.417
- We're not shooting the dog.
- No, don't shoot the dog.

01:10:22.419 --> 01:10:24.419
The dog
is the unifying character.

01:10:24.421 --> 01:10:27.689
The dog is the one that will
bring the family back together.

01:10:27.691 --> 01:10:28.856
Hmm.

01:10:32.629 --> 01:10:34.128
Harry.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:39.467
Amy, I forbid you ever to see
that Yvonne morticello again.

01:10:41.538 --> 01:10:43.037
Open up.

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:47.875
Oh, like you have
so much respect for him.

01:10:47.877 --> 01:10:50.511
Screaming at him all the time
for being out of a job.

01:10:50.513 --> 01:10:53.514
Making him feel like a total
loser. Why don't you get a job?

01:10:53.516 --> 01:10:55.717
How dare you?
You ungrateful little snatch!

01:10:55.719 --> 01:10:57.919
- Keep your hands off me!
- That's enough.

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:00.755
- Caffeine.
- All right.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:03.625
- Ha... j-mo, you idiot!
- Fuck.

01:11:06.029 --> 01:11:08.296
Shane, j-mo, get your asses
back in here right now.

01:11:08.298 --> 01:11:10.231
They're coming back. We can't
be spotted. Get back here!

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:11.933
Uh!

01:11:12.969 --> 01:11:14.302
Watch the dog!

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:16.804
Oh!

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:19.207
- Oh!
- You did not just hit the dog!

01:11:19.209 --> 01:11:21.042
- I'll back up.
- Oh, my god!

01:11:21.044 --> 01:11:23.211
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my god!

01:11:23.213 --> 01:11:25.947
God, I think you just hit him!
Oh, no!

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:29.217
- Oh! Oh! Shit!
- Oh, my god!

01:11:29.219 --> 01:11:31.519
- Son of a bitch.
- Harry.

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:32.920
- Oh!
- Oh, my god!

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:34.722
I didn't see him.
He just bolted out!

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:36.758
<i>You killed Harry!
Oh, my god!</i>

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.359
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

01:11:38.361 --> 01:11:40.395
<i>- I didn't see him!</i>
- You didn't hear me say...

01:11:40.397 --> 01:11:42.196
"The dog!
Watch the fucking dog!"

01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:44.666
He bolted out. I didn't see him.
Who left the door unlocked?

01:11:44.668 --> 01:11:45.933
- Again!
- It wasn't me!

01:11:45.935 --> 01:11:47.502
- Oh, my god.
- Did you leave it unlocked?

01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:49.837
Is this another one
of your acts of defiance?

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:52.273
It's my fault that you
just killed my dog?

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:53.775
Oh, god!

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:56.177
Oh.

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:58.680
I will never
forgive you for this!

01:11:58.682 --> 01:12:01.182
Oh, my god!

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:02.517
Oh, Harry.

01:12:06.122 --> 01:12:07.822
Oh, god.

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:11.059
I'm so sorry.

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:14.395
There's your happy ending,
asshole.

01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:18.599
Goddamn it!
It was right in front of you!

01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:20.935
All you had to do
was stop the fricking car!

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:22.537
You think I'd run over
my own dog?

01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:24.739
Yes! I don't know
what to think of you anymore!

01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:26.908
- I didn't see the dog.
- Where are you going?

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:30.278
- None of your beeswax!
- Get your ass back here!

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.747
- Amy, come back here.
- Get back in here, Amy!

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:34.415
We know you're upset
about Harry.

01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:37.552
- We're all upset about Harry.
- Get away from me!

01:12:37.554 --> 01:12:39.420
Let's talk about this
like a family.

01:12:39.422 --> 01:12:40.922
We're not a family!

01:12:40.924 --> 01:12:42.490
Dennis, don't let her drive off!

01:12:42.492 --> 01:12:44.058
- Stop!
- I don't blame you.

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.761
- I am sorry.
- Get off of me!

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:48.963
I don't blame you.
It's not your fault.

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:52.100
- It's my fault, Amy.
- Talk to mommy!

01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:54.635
Amy talk to mommy!

01:12:54.637 --> 01:12:57.338
- Amy!
- Oh, my god!

01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:59.006
Somebody follow her.
I don't care where she goes.

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:01.609
- Put somebody on her.
- Should I chase after her?

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:03.444
I want you out.

01:13:03.446 --> 01:13:07.882
- What?
- I want you out of this house!

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:10.318
Katherine, I...
I know you don't mean that.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.021
Don't touch me!
You disgust me!

01:13:14.023 --> 01:13:17.658
Katherine. Where is this
coming from all of a sudden?

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:21.162
All of a sudden?
Are you really that blind?

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:24.799
- Katherine...
- I want you out!

01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:26.634
Now!

01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:10.511
It's all right. My parents
aren't going to be back...

01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:12.480
From their safari for a month.

01:14:12.482 --> 01:14:14.882
It's gonna be a nonstop party.

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:17.952
Good. I need a distraction.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:21.222
Ooh. My spies tell me
Mike is on his way.

01:14:21.224 --> 01:14:23.825
So, remember, when he gets here,
you gotta play it totally cool.

01:14:23.827 --> 01:14:26.828
Just go right up to him and be
like, "hey' what's up?"

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:28.329
You don't even care
that he's here...

01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:30.198
Because you're so into Tyler.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.934
And Tyler's prepped,
and he's gonna play along.

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:35.236
Cool.

01:14:35.238 --> 01:14:37.505
Here. Take this.

01:14:39.008 --> 01:14:41.275
- What is that?
- Ecstasy.

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:44.512
- I don't know.
- No, no, no. Don't think.

01:14:44.514 --> 01:14:47.381
Think long, think wrong.
Just do.

01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:49.417
And swallow.

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:54.856
See? Come on.

01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:57.058
Let's go out there
and be responsible teenagers.

01:14:57.727 --> 01:14:59.393
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:06.033
This is great. All right.

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:08.269
Do you need me,
or can I get in on this?

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.840
- Right.
- I'm just gonna ignore that.

01:15:28.591 --> 01:15:31.259
- Amy, can we talk for a minute?
- Back off, friend.

01:15:31.261 --> 01:15:33.461
- Can't you see she's busy?
- Don't call me friend, asshole.

01:15:33.463 --> 01:15:35.997
- I wanna talk to my girlfriend.
- Ex-girlfriend.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:37.732
Amy, are you drunk?

01:15:37.734 --> 01:15:42.169
I am drunk, I am high,
i am young, and I'm hot.

01:15:43.673 --> 01:15:45.439
I have something
very important to talk about,

01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:47.141
but it's gotta be in private.

01:15:47.143 --> 01:15:48.976
I don't like
what's happening to you.

01:15:48.978 --> 01:15:50.211
Tough titty!

01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:53.915
She's got nothin'
to say to you, Mike.

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:56.317
You stay out of this.
You're nothing but trouble.

01:15:56.319 --> 01:16:00.254
She's got a new boyfriend now,
and you'll have to deal with it.

01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:03.424
Oh, and if, uh,
you think she's still a virgin,

01:16:03.426 --> 01:16:04.992
you're sadly mistaken.

01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:08.596
Because Tyler here, he's been
fucking the shit out of her.

01:16:08.598 --> 01:16:10.865
Oh, and after four years,

01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:13.067
you never got to tap that,
did you?

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:15.303
Tyler fucked her
the night they met.

01:16:15.305 --> 01:16:18.306
- Poor Mikey.
- Get the fuck outta here.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.862
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:44.131
Jesus Christ, man.

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:46.067
Mickey, Mickey...

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:47.902
Just go with it.
Just go with it.

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:49.704
He's not gonna do it.
He's not gonna do it.

01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:52.039
- I think he's gonna do it.
- He's too big of a pussy.

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:53.040
He'll never do it.

01:17:00.016 --> 01:17:01.382
I know you.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.659
Amy!

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:18.666
Amy!

01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:20.568
Amy, open this fucking door!

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:23.004
Fuck you!
Keep going.

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:26.941
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
What the...

01:17:31.614 --> 01:17:33.414
Fucking bastard!

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:34.949
- Get fucking off me!
- Yeah!

01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:36.984
Mike, wait!
What are you doing?

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:39.754
Stop! You made your choice,
now deal with it!

01:17:39.756 --> 01:17:41.589
I may have acted
like an asshole,

01:17:41.591 --> 01:17:42.923
but you're a fucking monster!

01:17:42.925 --> 01:17:44.291
You made her
into a fucking monster!

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:46.594
Shut the fuck up.
Look, fine.

01:17:46.596 --> 01:17:48.062
Now have it your way.

01:17:48.064 --> 01:17:50.765
I wanted to do this in private,
but fuck it!

01:17:54.904 --> 01:17:57.605
Nice extracurricular
activities, you slut.

01:17:57.607 --> 01:18:00.207
You whore.

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:02.109
Damn!

01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:03.611
Holy sh...

01:18:03.613 --> 01:18:06.847
Good-bye, Harvard.
Hello, porn career.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:09.817
You told me
no one would see these!

01:18:09.819 --> 01:18:11.519
- Ed-e swore to me...
- I hate you!

01:18:11.521 --> 01:18:13.788
- You ruined my life!
- Amy, wait!

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:17.558
Don't fucking look
at those, asshole.

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:23.731
Amy!

01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:29.937
Amy! Amy, stop!

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.574
Elliot, start her up!
Elliot, follow her!

01:19:44.147 --> 01:19:45.646
Hello?

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:48.983
This is Dennis Warwick.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.820
What?

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:55.790
My god, is she all right?

01:20:02.932 --> 01:20:05.533
Oh, my god!

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:13.340
God!

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:16.544
No!

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:27.555
No! Oh, god, no!

01:20:28.925 --> 01:20:30.424
Amy Warwick, please.

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:32.426
Mr. Warwick,
I'm lt. Simmons.

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:34.028
Where's my daughter?
Is she all right?

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:36.997
She's all right,
but she's inconsolable.

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:38.999
We tried calling your house
a number of times...

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:40.041
And no one answered.

01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:46.273
Listen, before I take you
to her, you should know,

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:48.843
your daughter struck
and killed a pregnant woman...

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:50.044
On hanson boulevard.

01:20:50.046 --> 01:20:52.279
Amy was three times over
the legal alcohol limit.

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:53.948
God.

01:20:56.552 --> 01:20:58.485
No! No!

01:20:58.487 --> 01:21:01.555
- Let go of me!
- Go! Go!

01:21:01.557 --> 01:21:04.024
Let go of me!
Do something!

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:06.460
Amy!

01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:08.963
My baby! Oh!

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:11.465
No! Let go of me!

01:21:11.467 --> 01:21:13.901
Let go of me!

01:21:13.903 --> 01:21:16.103
Amy! Please!

01:21:16.105 --> 01:21:18.138
<i>- What do we do?</i>
- Oh, my god!

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.041
We gotta run in there
and tell them about the show.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:23.911
Just tell them about the cameras
and be like, "I'm so sorry.

01:21:23.913 --> 01:21:25.112
I'm sorry."

01:21:25.114 --> 01:21:27.014
- No, shut the fuck up!
- Shut up!

01:21:27.016 --> 01:21:28.182
- Shut up!
- What do we do?

01:21:28.184 --> 01:21:30.818
Shut up!
We keep shooting!

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:32.553
Everybody! Why?

01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:34.455
People die every day!

01:21:34.457 --> 01:21:35.756
We're just capturing it!

01:21:35.758 --> 01:21:39.226
Now, just chill, everybody!
Be professional!

01:21:51.774 --> 01:21:54.275
Mmm. Got another one in you?

01:21:55.444 --> 01:21:56.977
Somebody's making up
for lost time.

01:21:56.979 --> 01:22:01.615
Twenty years to be exact.

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:03.017
Hmm.

01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:38.052
Oh, my god.

01:22:45.394 --> 01:22:48.729
Oh, my god.

01:23:02.244 --> 01:23:04.044
- Ah! Oh, my, yes!
- Fuck.

01:23:04.046 --> 01:23:06.046
- No, don't stop. Don't stop!
- Fuck! Fuck!

01:23:06.048 --> 01:23:08.048
Yes!

01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:10.150
Oh, my god.

01:23:15.591 --> 01:23:17.758
This has gone way too far.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.460
- This needs to stop.
- Yes, please.

01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:21.962
Where the fuck do you think
you're going, Shane?

01:23:21.964 --> 01:23:23.831
Shit your fucking ass down
and shut up.

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:25.299
That goes for every one of you.

01:23:26.969 --> 01:23:30.270
Oh, god. Yeah.

01:23:30.272 --> 01:23:32.639
Ah, don't stop. Don't stop.

01:23:32.641 --> 01:23:34.174
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.743
Ah, god.

01:23:35.745 --> 01:23:37.678
Oh! Yeah!

01:23:40.016 --> 01:23:41.582
Ah!

01:23:41.584 --> 01:23:43.650
Oh, god! Yeah! Don't stop!

01:23:49.392 --> 01:23:50.491
Oh, fuck.

01:23:50.493 --> 01:23:51.692
- Huh? What?
- Oh, fuck.

01:23:51.694 --> 01:23:53.060
Oh, no. No!

01:23:53.062 --> 01:23:55.295
Oh! Uh!

01:23:55.297 --> 01:23:56.964
Ah!

01:23:59.335 --> 01:24:01.101
No! No! God, help me!

01:24:01.103 --> 01:24:03.537
Oh, god!

01:24:09.845 --> 01:24:11.745
Oh! Oh!

01:24:19.155 --> 01:24:21.955
I just popped in to tell you
your daughter's dead.

01:24:28.998 --> 01:24:30.497
- Oh!
- Ohhh!

01:24:30.499 --> 01:24:33.233
Holy shit!
He's totally fucking lost it!

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:34.435
Oh, my god.

01:24:34.437 --> 01:24:36.236
Hello, 911.
I'd like to report a murder.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:38.372
What the fuck are you doing?
Gimme that fucking phone!

01:24:38.374 --> 01:24:40.641
- Gimme that fucking phone!
- Oh, god!

01:24:40.643 --> 01:24:42.142
- I'm calling 911!
- No!

01:24:42.144 --> 01:24:43.477
Fuck!

01:24:43.479 --> 01:24:45.679
Fuck! Fuck!

01:24:47.483 --> 01:24:50.918
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

01:24:52.488 --> 01:24:54.688
No! No, no!

01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:56.957
Listen!
It's not what it looks like!

01:24:56.959 --> 01:24:59.193
It's not what you think it is.
I'm gonna tell...

01:24:59.195 --> 01:25:03.097
It's a... it's a show.

01:25:03.099 --> 01:25:07.568
- Okay? It's a show.
- What?

01:25:07.570 --> 01:25:09.636
It's all a fucking reality show!

01:25:09.638 --> 01:25:12.372
You've been the stars
of a reality show for months!

01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:15.008
- Jesus, get off of me!
- Mickey, Mickey.

01:25:15.010 --> 01:25:16.343
I'm an actor!

01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:19.113
I was hired
to fucking seduce your wife...

01:25:19.115 --> 01:25:21.115
To make the show
more interesting!

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:24.518
There's a producer. He...

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.387
Fuck!
His name's Mickey Wagner, okay?

01:25:27.389 --> 01:25:29.056
He's the one that hired me.

01:25:29.058 --> 01:25:31.291
He's the one that
put me up to this.

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:33.494
He's the one that's
had you under surveillance!

01:25:33.496 --> 01:25:35.496
There's fucking cameras
everywhere.

01:25:35.498 --> 01:25:38.532
All over your house.
All over your car, your work.

01:25:38.534 --> 01:25:39.633
Everywhere!

01:25:39.635 --> 01:25:41.568
Dude, you didn't lose your job.

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:44.605
He fucking got you fired!

01:25:44.607 --> 01:25:46.106
It's all fake!

01:25:47.343 --> 01:25:49.743
He thought your family
was too boring for TV,

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:53.814
so he fucking injected conflict
to create drama.

01:25:55.651 --> 01:26:00.254
He's watching right now from
a fucking Van across the street.

01:26:00.256 --> 01:26:02.422
It's not my fault.

01:26:02.424 --> 01:26:04.758
Just let me go.
Just let me go.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.294
Let me go!

01:26:09.932 --> 01:26:12.166
Cameras everywhere?

01:26:15.804 --> 01:26:20.007
<i>It's all fake!</i>

01:26:20.009 --> 01:26:23.410
<i>It's all a fucking reality show!</i>

01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:37.658
Oh, shit.

01:26:48.204 --> 01:26:50.270
Mickey Wagner?

01:26:51.907 --> 01:26:53.540
<i>I'm gonna kill you.</i>

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:57.444
- Drive! Drive!
- Boss, boss, look!

01:26:57.446 --> 01:26:59.246
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, fuck.

01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:04.151
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

01:27:04.153 --> 01:27:06.386
Get us the fuck outta here!

01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:09.523
I know you're in there!

01:27:09.525 --> 01:27:11.258
I can see you!

01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:13.527
- Oh, no!
- Jesus Christ.

01:27:13.529 --> 01:27:15.429
You destroyed my family!

01:27:15.431 --> 01:27:18.365
You destroyed my life!

01:27:18.367 --> 01:27:19.900
Come out of there!

01:27:21.637 --> 01:27:23.503
Go, go, go!

01:27:37.019 --> 01:27:40.020
- He's gonna kill us!
- What's happening?

01:27:40.022 --> 01:27:42.322
I'm gonna kill you!

01:27:44.026 --> 01:27:45.425
Oh, god!

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:48.228
You come into my family!

01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:49.863
You come into my house!

01:27:49.865 --> 01:27:52.766
I'm coming into yours!

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:54.101
Oh, my god!

01:28:16.959 --> 01:28:18.825
Uh... ow.

01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:22.362
Get up,
get up. Get up, get up, get up!

01:28:22.364 --> 01:28:24.031
Go!

01:28:24.033 --> 01:28:26.500
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:28:34.543 --> 01:28:36.143
Ah!

01:28:51.727 --> 01:28:53.327
Jeez!

01:28:55.397 --> 01:28:59.499
- Wait!
- You're Mickey Wagner.

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:01.568
Dennis, just calm down.

01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:03.837
Why did you do this to me?

01:29:05.374 --> 01:29:08.942
Why did you do this?
I had the perfect life.

01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:11.178
And now I have nothing.

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:14.014
Because of you.

01:29:16.318 --> 01:29:19.786
Dennis, it is an honor...

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:23.790
To finally meet you
face to face.

01:29:24.793 --> 01:29:26.593
I... I feel as though...

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:30.430
I've come to know you
and your wonderful family...

01:29:30.432 --> 01:29:34.334
In a way that nobody has ever
come to know you before.

01:29:34.336 --> 01:29:35.836
Cut the bullshit!

01:29:37.439 --> 01:29:39.506
I wanna know why?

01:29:41.343 --> 01:29:45.846
Because... I wanted
to make good television.

01:29:45.848 --> 01:29:49.249
I wanted to make you a star.

01:29:49.251 --> 01:29:50.784
Now, Dennis...

01:29:51.954 --> 01:29:54.054
There's a silver lining to this.

01:29:55.157 --> 01:29:58.258
If you can just
see beyond this moment...

01:29:59.661 --> 01:30:02.863
And take in
the big picture here.

01:30:02.865 --> 01:30:05.766
I know... I know you're in
a lot of pain right now.

01:30:06.869 --> 01:30:10.771
But if you trust me,
i can help you...

01:30:10.773 --> 01:30:12.773
Turn this pain...

01:30:14.877 --> 01:30:16.610
Into fame.

01:30:19.882 --> 01:30:21.615
Fuck fame!
