00:01.280 --> 00:03.330
everyday the world is sending its messages

00:03.780 --> 00:06.280
Signals. some of those signals are easy.

00:07.490 --> 00:08.890
A store's having a sale.

00:09.140 --> 00:11.330
Return address labels will cure cancer.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.740
"we will shut off your phone."

00:17.360 --> 00:19.850
But some signals are harder to read.

00:24.870 --> 00:25.750
"hey!"

00:28.350 --> 00:29.220
"hey!"

00:30.500 --> 00:33.430
"hey! I missed you, and I'd love to see you at my show."

00:33.930 --> 00:36.880
"hey! come to the show. let's make chloe jealous."

00:36.940 --> 00:39.150
"hey! I'm having a show do not come."

00:39.210 --> 00:41.160
"hey! I just ordered too many invitations,

00:41.160 --> 00:43.150
And I'm just sending them out to everybody I know."

00:43.230 --> 00:44.570
"hey! have a good summer.

00:44.570 --> 00:46.800
-I hope we have classes together next year." -"hey!

00:46.800 --> 00:48.000
ever since I got hit by a car,

00:48.000 --> 00:49.540
I talk to myself an awful lot."

00:49.540 --> 00:50.780
How long have you been there?

00:51.330 --> 00:55.190
I watch you sometimes. you have a head injury. I worry.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.710
All right. well, should I go?

00:56.720 --> 00:58.010
Oh, sweetheart, you can't go.

00:58.010 --> 01:00.410
no, thank you. you're right. I am not going.

01:00.710 --> 01:03.650
-But you have to go. -your brain damage is

01:03.650 --> 01:05.310
A little bit different than mine, isn't it?

01:05.310 --> 01:06.790
Well, what signal do you want to send?

01:07.160 --> 01:09.200
If you don't go, it says, "i'm not over you,

01:09.200 --> 01:10.900
And I can't bear to see you with chloe."

01:10.900 --> 01:12.770
And if you do go, it says, "i'm not over you,

01:12.770 --> 01:14.510
But I can't bear to be apart." 

01:14.510 --> 01:16.050
what does it say if he's found with this 

01:16.050 --> 01:17.260
Crammed down his throat?

01:17.260 --> 01:19.560
oh, don't do that. I need the address.

01:19.560 --> 01:22.950
-What? you're going? -hey, I didn't sleep with him.

01:22.950 --> 01:26.210
Oh, god. I cannot believe that he just dumped this in my lap.

01:26.610 --> 01:28.190
Well, you know what? I'm not gonna go.

01:28.230 --> 01:31.390
And just so there's no confusion of the signal that I'm sending,

01:31.390 --> 01:32.740
I'm gonna go tell him face-to-face

01:32.740 --> 01:35.430
That the reason I'm not going is because I have moved on...

01:35.430 --> 01:37.670
And I have better things to do that night.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.630
-Hey. -now what the hell is that supposed to mean?

01:45.590 --> 01:48.080
So is he coming down or what? here. call him again.

01:48.670 --> 01:49.400
Cause you know what?

01:49.400 --> 01:52.200
For some reason, I'm not welcome into the apartment that I own.

01:52.390 --> 01:54.210
Maybe because you tried to destroy

01:54.210 --> 01:55.760
His relationship with chloe.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.360
I don't know. I'm not a mind reader.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.550
Oh! did I tell you?

02:00.830 --> 02:04.020
He invited me to his gallery show.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.110
He invited me, too, but, sadly,

02:06.110 --> 02:07.460
I teach comedy traffic school that night.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.660
well, you know what?

02:08.660 --> 02:11.070
I'm not going either. I don't care if he begs me.

02:11.570 --> 02:13.590
And i-i don't care what it says to anyone,

02:13.590 --> 02:17.160
Cause you know what? I've moved on, and I am a-ok.

02:17.390 --> 02:20.220
-Or maybe you love him. -stop it! shut up!

02:20.540 --> 02:22.170
Why do you do stuff like that?

02:22.170 --> 02:23.670
They won't let me listen to the radio.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.270
You!

02:35.560 --> 02:36.460
Hey, sam.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.640
-Hey. -what's up?

02:37.640 --> 02:41.260
Uh, I got your little invitation challenge to your show.

02:41.450 --> 02:43.140
Yeah, about that...

02:43.160 --> 02:46.940
Um, chloe kinda found out I sent you an invitation

02:46.940 --> 02:50.560
And... strongly suggested you don't come.

02:50.580 --> 02:51.480
Chloe did?

02:51.480 --> 02:52.490
Yeah, she just kinda thinks

02:52.490 --> 02:54.890
That the feelings might be a little raw still.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.410
I-i don't know...

02:56.410 --> 03:00.470
And that, um, maybe you're not... over me.

03:00.760 --> 03:01.910
Over you?

03:04.800 --> 03:07.360
I am so over you.

03:07.540 --> 03:10.760
Yeah. no, I'm actually gonnbe at your little show

03:10.760 --> 03:12.000
With a date.

03:12.010 --> 03:15.160
-A date? -oh, I'm sorry that I haven't filled you in

03:15.160 --> 03:16.720
On all the details of my life,

03:16.720 --> 03:20.160
But, um, while I was so busy getting over you,

03:20.240 --> 03:22.010
I actually met someone,

03:22.010 --> 03:24.660
And, um, it has turned into something real.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.640
And his name is rance,

03:26.640 --> 03:29.520
And he's very comfortable with himself,

03:29.520 --> 03:31.660
And he has nothing to prove.

03:31.660 --> 03:36.510
So I will see you at the shizzow, okay?

03:39.890 --> 03:40.610
Rance?

03:40.610 --> 03:41.460
I know!

03:50.940 --> 03:52.700
Oh, I'm so stupid!

03:53.750 --> 03:55.830
Maybe I'll just tell him that rance got called into surgery

03:55.830 --> 03:57.940
-And he can't go. -oh, he's a doctor now?

03:57.940 --> 04:00.960
Yes, he's a doctor, and now I am going to the show alone.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.770
Alone? why not just go with a million cats?

04:03.770 --> 04:06.110
-Maybe I will. -you won't catch me at an art show.

04:06.110 --> 04:07.710
I don't like art. it makes me feel things.

04:07.710 --> 04:09.210
I don't like to feel things

04:09.210 --> 04:11.510
you're feeling plenty of things right now.

04:11.540 --> 04:12.490
Excuse me.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.200
I'm the boyfriend. deal with it.

04:15.410 --> 04:17.019
God. that's my boss.

04:17.019 --> 04:19.470
There's gotta be some kind of line he's crossing here, right?

04:19.470 --> 04:22.089
-It's not happening if you don't look at it. -like poverty.

04:22.110 --> 04:25.510
you know what? I can do this.

04:25.570 --> 04:28.880
I can do this, cause, yeah, I'm attractive.

04:29.040 --> 04:32.010
Right? all this, you know, up in here.

04:32.410 --> 04:34.700
-I can get a guy by tomorrow. -make it a hot guy.

04:34.700 --> 04:38.060
Right. a hot guy. a hot guy, like, "check it out, dude.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.570
I'm bringing a hot guy to your gallery show

04:39.570 --> 04:41.070
no, if you bring a hot guy,

04:41.070 --> 04:43.250
It'll just seem like you're trying to make todd jealous.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.510
-Loser guy. I'm bringing a loser guy to the gallery show. -no.

04:46.510 --> 04:48.320
if I see a hot chick with a loser guy,

04:48.320 --> 04:51.310
It's like she's saying, "hey! hey, check me out. try me.

04:51.310 --> 04:53.330
I'm get-able." I'm right in there.

04:53.330 --> 04:55.830
I'd kill her. look at me. I will.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.760
come here, breakfast.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.050
And there goes mine.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.020
Ooh, look. there's a hot guy. trip him.

05:06.020 --> 05:07.070
I don't want to have a hot guy.

05:07.070 --> 05:09.700
I just want a-a nonthreatening, but not pathetic,

05:09.700 --> 05:12.630
Perfectly average, run-of-the-mill rance.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.660
That's why we're going to a bookstore.

05:14.660 --> 05:15.800
Once you get inside,

05:15.800 --> 05:18.100
Look for a guy who's buying "marley & me."

05:18.100 --> 05:20.600
-That means he's got a soul. -or a boyfriend.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.220
Look, you do not need to cruise a bookstore for a date.

05:24.260 --> 05:25.510
Go with this guy I know.

05:25.510 --> 05:27.740
He's the most vicious art critic in all of chicago.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.450
-It'll destroy todd. -I don't want to destroy todd.

05:31.510 --> 05:32.830
Oh, then I'm lost here.

05:34.940 --> 05:36.130
It's okay, andrea.

05:36.140 --> 05:38.190
You know, I'm probably just better at this

05:38.220 --> 05:40.710
Because, you know, I'm in a relationship,

05:40.710 --> 05:43.650
And--and you're not, and, you know,

05:43.650 --> 05:46.000
It's of a give and ta-- okay.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.074

06:01.720 --> 06:04.440
Ooh! ooh! excuse me. could you reach this for me?

06:04.440 --> 06:05.550
I don't work here.

06:05.870 --> 06:08.480
Well, that's too bad, cause it was a book on manners!

06:11.630 --> 06:12.850
-What? -come here.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.610
Carry on.

06:30.670 --> 06:33.540
Mm. so... whatcha readin'?

06:35.350 --> 06:37.120
"controlling your anger."

06:38.700 --> 06:41.350
Step one--don't look at the prices in this place, right?

06:41.370 --> 06:43.400
Am I right? am I right?

06:48.440 --> 06:50.590
Oh. excuse me, miss. miss, hi.

06:50.590 --> 06:52.910
Can you just put that back, please?

06:52.920 --> 06:53.980
Why? do you want it?

06:53.980 --> 06:56.080
no. just-- can you just put it back?

06:56.080 --> 06:57.140
So you're not buying it.

06:57.140 --> 06:59.440
You're just spending some quality time with it?

06:59.480 --> 07:02.650
Look, as a favor to me, can you just put it back?

07:02.650 --> 07:03.750
oh, to you?

07:03.930 --> 07:06.580
Well, if it's for you, after all you've done for me...

07:06.740 --> 07:08.970
-Uh, just--can you just give it to me? -hey! do not grab!

07:09.010 --> 07:12.210
-Oh! oh! do not push! -oh, I just did.

07:13.210 --> 07:16.150
She's the one who started it! she's--oh, forget it.

07:16.150 --> 07:17.780
Nobody reads anymore anyway!

07:17.890 --> 07:20.420
This place is gonna be a yogurt shop in two months!

07:23.380 --> 07:24.380
Damn it!

07:25.190 --> 07:28.110
Come on. damn it!

07:28.980 --> 07:30.550
If you're trying to break into this car,

07:30.550 --> 07:32.950
You're drawing an awful lot of attention to yourself.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.630
Anyone can get in with a key.

07:34.630 --> 07:36.550
I let to give myself a challenge.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.210
Yeah, but that's not gonna work

07:38.210 --> 07:40.860
Cause you got that thingy bent all wrong.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.670
You just said "thingy." you're disqualified.

07:46.300 --> 07:50.510
I don't want to sound sexist, but you're in my sandbox here.

07:50.740 --> 07:53.150
Okay, here we go. almost got it.

07:53.380 --> 07:54.880
Almost got it.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.040
Got it!

08:04.970 --> 08:06.490
Do you like photography?

08:11.250 --> 08:13.650
Look at all these city people here at todd's show.

08:13.770 --> 08:15.380
I'll bet somone in here is a bisexual.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.110
-These photos are not good. -shh! howard!

08:19.250 --> 08:21.680
What would you know? the only pictures you like

08:21.770 --> 08:23.760
Are the ones on the menu that help you order.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.030
What about that one?

08:25.970 --> 08:28.580
Oh, I should have left you in the car.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.890
Art should challenge you.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.760
If I'm gonna pay $12 for parking,

08:32.780 --> 08:34.409
Art should make me think.

08:34.530 --> 08:36.080
I'm not thinking, regina.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.080
Well, don't let that stop you from talking.

08:41.100 --> 08:41.890
Hey.

08:42.010 --> 08:44.020
Oh, hey. good. you're here.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.420
Do I look okay? your message was a little confusing.

08:47.420 --> 08:49.060
I haven't been to many art shows,

08:49.060 --> 08:51.340
But I've never heard of "casual average."

08:51.340 --> 08:53.000
Yeah. no, no, it's good. it's good.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.410
You're not too dressed up,

08:54.410 --> 08:56.590
And, uh, the sweater's-- it's a little pilly.

08:56.590 --> 08:57.910
It's perfect. perfect.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.950
Let's--let's go... look at... some art.

09:09.950 --> 09:10.730
Todd!

09:12.800 --> 09:16.260
Sam's here. you told me you told her not to come.

09:16.810 --> 09:18.780
-I did. -well, then wha--

09:19.160 --> 09:21.590
Can we not do this now? I have a lot on my mind.

09:21.590 --> 09:23.120
It is my first gallery show.

09:24.290 --> 09:27.640
Baby, let's just get outta here.

09:29.570 --> 09:30.480
Buildings...

09:30.650 --> 09:31.780
Buildings...

09:32.430 --> 09:33.720
Buildings.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.350
Okay, now we're talking.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.820
Oh, well, sure, you like that one. it's a naked woman.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.190
Well, that's not why I like it. there's an overall theme.

09:43.190 --> 09:44.350
There's an intimacy to it.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.350
well, that's what those artists do

09:46.350 --> 09:48.890
They get these models drunk, they loosen their inhibitions,

09:48.910 --> 09:50.610
And they have sex with them. you saw "titanic." well,

09:50.610 --> 09:52.050
i don't like it because of the sex.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.340
There's an idea. there's a point of view.

09:54.340 --> 09:57.940
-There's a mole. that's our daughter. -oh, my god!

10:01.350 --> 10:02.980
Could you excuse me for a second?

10:03.110 --> 10:03.800
Hey.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.570
Great choice. this is gonna kill todd.

10:07.570 --> 10:09.310
I don't want to kill todd, all right?

10:09.310 --> 10:12.150
Because if he's dead, then he can't see how okay I am.

10:12.150 --> 10:14.890
Well, meet cameron, the art critic I told you about

10:14.890 --> 10:16.490
the vicious one?

10:16.490 --> 10:19.450
-Yeah, this is gonna kill todd. -we're not killing todd!

10:19.540 --> 10:21.200
This is not artisanal cheese.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.200
you're mad. go take it out on the photos.

10:24.710 --> 10:26.770
This craig guy--he looks familiar. do I know him?

10:26.770 --> 10:28.180
Oh, god. did you sleep with him?

10:28.180 --> 10:30.380
oh, please. he's wearing a swatch.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.620
-Where's dena, by the way? -oh, I don't know.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.000
i gave her the address myself.

10:35.110 --> 10:36.050
Oh. you know?

10:41.990 --> 10:44.040
-Hello? -it's limiting!

10:44.040 --> 10:45.560
It's confining! this is art!

10:45.700 --> 10:47.670
You are not a photograph.

10:48.290 --> 10:50.370
Is this the rawlston gallery?

10:50.370 --> 10:53.080
There is no freedom! there are no choices!

10:53.100 --> 10:54.110
This is art!

10:55.920 --> 10:56.790
Andrea.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.660
I hope she didn't get lost. mm, huh.

11:01.700 --> 11:02.560
Yeah. hi.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.270
Oh, hey. hi. I just spent the last five minutes

11:05.270 --> 11:07.600
Trying to understand a picture called "coat check"

11:07.600 --> 11:10.860
Until I realized it was actually a sign for the coat check. oh.

11:11.610 --> 11:14.360
-Can I take your coat? -yeah, sure, sure. thanks.

11:15.210 --> 11:17.730
Okay. oh, wait. wait. wait. just wait.

11:19.700 --> 11:20.520
Now.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.310
Oh. sorry.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.780
No, that's okay. oh, no. it's-- it's caught around my purse.

11:26.800 --> 11:27.460
It's okay. I gotta be able to get the...

11:27.460 --> 11:29.980
It's okay. I got it. i-i--just let go.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.380
just relax. oh, let go

11:33.020 --> 11:34.970
God. did you see her ankle bracelet? what a whore.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.410
You know what? I'm actually glad I slept with her boyfriend.

11:37.410 --> 11:38.320
you almost had to.

11:38.340 --> 11:39.500
I know, right? -oh, what? hey!

11:39.540 --> 11:41.380
Oh! oh! let go!

11:41.400 --> 11:43.200
You let go! I just got that!

11:43.330 --> 11:45.630
Man, you are strong. I thought you were older. oh!

11:45.670 --> 11:49.180
Older? what?! oh, crap!

11:49.210 --> 11:52.220
I know! I wanted to borrow that one.

11:58.580 --> 12:00.590
I brought a mugger to todd's show.

12:01.110 --> 12:03.490
Bad boys are hot. it's gonna kill todd.

12:03.730 --> 12:05.480
Andrea, he might actually kill todd.

12:05.480 --> 12:06.980
oh, just call the police.

12:06.980 --> 12:07.900
Oh, yeah, and have them

12:07.900 --> 12:10.040
Come arrest my new boyfriend who I know so well?

12:10.110 --> 12:12.920
No, no. i-i'm just gonna find him, get him outta here,

12:12.920 --> 12:14.030
And then I will call the police.

12:14.030 --> 12:15.630
this is gonna be hard to hear.

12:15.630 --> 12:18.150
-What? -you're probably not having sex tonight

12:20.170 --> 12:21.470
Yeah, I did--i didn't tell you this,

12:21.470 --> 12:23.020
Because then I thought you weren't gonna come

12:23.020 --> 12:25.970
And everything, but we are actually on a scavenger hunt!

12:25.990 --> 12:27.640
And the first thing that we were supposed to get

12:27.640 --> 12:29.920
Was a cheap glass of wine from an art gallery.

12:29.940 --> 12:33.750
And now what we need to find is a policeman's cap, so let's go.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.520
Oh! hey, guys.

12:37.730 --> 12:38.360
Hey.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.400
Sam!

12:39.420 --> 12:41.940
Todd. oh, my god. it's so crazy to see you.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.410
At my art show?.

12:43.410 --> 12:46.310
we love it. we love it, the two of us

12:46.320 --> 12:49.050
Yeah, me and, uh... my lover.

12:49.130 --> 12:49.810
See, chloe

12:49.810 --> 12:51.310
sam brought a date. they're dating.

12:51.310 --> 12:53.630
Really? for how long?

12:53.630 --> 12:55.690
Don't answer that. what, are you writing a book?

12:55.770 --> 12:57.440
Hi. uh, you must be rance.

12:57.450 --> 12:59.840
-Rance? -rance, rance, crazy pants.

12:59.860 --> 13:03.010
Yep, that's what they call him down at, um, the workplace.

13:03.020 --> 13:04.190
And where's that?

13:04.430 --> 13:07.650
-No one knows. -I manage a jazz club.

13:07.890 --> 13:09.230
Mm. likely story.

13:09.440 --> 13:13.020
-What?! -uh, likey story. I likey.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.320
I likey a lot, my boyfriend.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.320
Would you excuse us?

13:15.320 --> 13:17.880
We're gonna go enjoy the art by the exit.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.770
-"rance"? -just ignore him.

13:22.770 --> 13:25.270
Artists. you know, they all got syphilis or something.

13:25.270 --> 13:27.900
Makes 'em crazy. why am I the one explaining myself?

13:28.210 --> 13:30.290
Did I do something wrong here?

13:30.290 --> 13:32.690
I don't know. does this ring a bell?

13:33.720 --> 13:35.870
We're not on a scavenger hunt, are we?

13:35.890 --> 13:39.310
Three years ago, in the park, next to the zebra bar,

13:39.330 --> 13:41.920
You ripped one of these out of my hands.

13:41.950 --> 13:43.930
So what do you have to say about that?

13:45.090 --> 13:47.210
It's... possible.

13:48.780 --> 13:50.920
Okay. i, um...

13:52.240 --> 13:54.490
Need a minute because I only had something to say

13:54.490 --> 13:56.550
If you had said, "no, I did not."

13:56.710 --> 13:58.120
Just, um...

13:59.540 --> 14:00.450
Take your time.

14:00.490 --> 14:01.610
Yeah. okay.

14:02.030 --> 14:03.160
There is nothing new!

14:03.160 --> 14:05.060
there is no innovation! this is art!

14:05.060 --> 14:06.670
You know, I tried to be nice to andrea.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.880
I invite her to my lunches with sam at the souplantation.

14:08.880 --> 14:13.330
There are no possibilities! there is no truth! this is--

14:13.330 --> 14:16.580
No! no! there's no truth because she's always lying!

14:17.860 --> 14:20.660
There is no meaning! there is no point! this--

14:20.660 --> 14:22.050
Yeah! yeah, there's no point--

14:22.050 --> 14:24.460
No point in trying to push me aside, 'cause I have spent

14:24.460 --> 14:27.280
The last 20 years waiting to be friends with sam again,

14:27.280 --> 14:29.750
And if andrea thinks she's just gonna get in between us,

14:29.750 --> 14:31.570
I will twist her head off like a little bottle top

14:31.570 --> 14:32.870
will you just shut up?

14:33.260 --> 14:36.090
I'm the only one who's supposed to be talking here!

14:37.100 --> 14:39.380
-Yeah, the--the rawlston gallery... -oh, yes!

14:39.880 --> 14:42.570
Is run by morons, and they would never get what I do... oh.

14:42.570 --> 14:44.420
But they are at 18th and halsted,

14:44.420 --> 14:46.590
So will you just get outta here?!

14:47.910 --> 14:48.920
Thank you.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.030
I really hope somebody buys you.

14:52.070 --> 14:53.900
I'm not for sale. get outta here!

14:57.880 --> 15:02.030
So you just woke up one day and decided to stop stealing.

15:02.060 --> 15:05.050
No, uh, you were the last person I robbed, actually.

15:05.460 --> 15:06.330
Oh, really?

15:06.490 --> 15:09.780
Was it something in my eyes that inspired you to change?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.720
No, no. you wouldn't let go of your purse.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.020
I separated my shoulder.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.120
My arm was in a sling for weeks.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.980
I didn't have insurance, so I had to use a paper bag.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:19.700 --> 15:20.850
That--that's okay.

15:20.870 --> 15:22.720
So, yeah, I've changed,

15:22.750 --> 15:25.710
But people really don't believe that's possible, so...

15:31.960 --> 15:32.850
I do.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.010
What?

15:34.120 --> 15:35.850
Believe that people can change.

15:39.370 --> 15:41.090
You wanna stick around,

15:41.540 --> 15:43.120
Eat somethin'?

15:43.220 --> 15:45.470
-You sure? -yeah.

15:46.610 --> 15:49.040
Oh, just, uh, just for the record,

15:49.720 --> 15:53.700
That was your car that we were breaking into, right?

15:54.750 --> 15:56.110
Yes, it was.

15:59.580 --> 16:01.960
Nothing to see here. keep it moving, fellas.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.440
Keep it--keep it moving.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.010
I forgive the artist for all his other sins here tonight.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.250
This photograph is transcendent.

16:08.250 --> 16:09.760
You want a punch in the nose?

16:11.970 --> 16:12.790
Howard.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.850
Howard, what are you doing?

16:14.850 --> 16:16.510
I protected her body on her prom night,

16:16.510 --> 16:18.250
And I'm gonna protect it now. well,

16:18.250 --> 16:19.820
I have news for you about your prom night.

16:19.860 --> 16:22.340
-What? -nothing.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.440
Can I get you a refill?

16:36.160 --> 16:37.060
Thank you.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.080
I thought you were getting rid of him.

16:41.100 --> 16:41.880
Yeah, but you know what?

16:41.880 --> 16:43.580
he said he's changed, and I believe him.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.910
I mean, if I can't believe that someone's changed,

16:45.930 --> 16:47.940
Then how can I expect anyone else to believe that I have,

16:48.010 --> 16:49.940
-Right? -did he threaten your family?

16:49.960 --> 16:51.400
Hmm? because you don't really like them.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.130
I'm serious. 

16:52.130 --> 16:54.930
hey, wouldn't it be crazy if in pretending

16:54.950 --> 16:57.440
To be moving on, that I actually was moving on?

16:57.450 --> 17:00.160
Cause you know what? i-i kinda like him.

17:03.180 --> 17:05.180
Oh, my god! oh, my god! it's my date!

17:05.180 --> 17:06.359
It's my date! he's a thief! 

17:06.359 --> 17:08.660
stop him! he's a thief! let's go. come on.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.770
He's a... I was just trying to hide it.

17:10.099 --> 17:11.859
I'm tired of people ogling my daughter.

17:14.780 --> 17:15.640
Sam?

17:19.690 --> 17:22.339
So you still think I'm a thief.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.440
A thief?

17:24.099 --> 17:26.950
A thief who stole my heart!

17:29.070 --> 17:30.950
We can go whenever you want. um...

17:36.400 --> 17:38.040
Please stay

17:38.150 --> 17:39.740
Until the accusation thing,

17:39.740 --> 17:40.890
We were having such a good time! 

17:40.890 --> 17:43.090
no, I think I should go.

17:43.580 --> 17:46.140
I think I need to date people I haven't robbed.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.580
And still no apology for that.

17:50.660 --> 17:54.330
You two have shamed me in front of the chicago art world.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.720
I bought eight of todd's photos

17:56.720 --> 17:57.970
Out of pure embarrassment.

17:58.170 --> 18:00.010
I hope you like silhouettes of trees.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.430
I'm sorry, dad.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.760
A pretty humiliating night for both of us, huh?

18:07.800 --> 18:09.870
No, just you.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.890
It's a naked picture of your ex-girlfriend.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.470
Look, i-i only put it in the show to sell it...

18:18.780 --> 18:21.040
To make money to--to buy you a present.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.580
Shut up, todd. you still want her.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.870
-Why can't you just admit it? -because it's not true.

18:25.870 --> 18:26.590
Oh, yeah?

18:26.600 --> 18:29.430
Well, if you love me so much, where's my naked picture?

18:29.520 --> 18:33.090
I mean, am I not a fitting enough subject for your art?

18:33.130 --> 18:35.550
Are these babies not good enough for you?

19:07.180 --> 19:09.310
You brought a mugger to my show?

19:10.310 --> 19:13.430
Yeah, well, I was, uh, gonna bring a serial killer,

19:13.430 --> 19:14.960
But his van broke down.

19:16.060 --> 19:18.190
I mean, you can date whoever you want.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.670
I'm not dating...

19:20.650 --> 19:22.850
I know. I get it.

19:23.490 --> 19:24.790
What about you, smart guy?

19:24.810 --> 19:26.340
Did you really think this one through?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.330
Well, I have a right to display my art.

19:29.340 --> 19:30.300
Oh, give it up. 

19:30.300 --> 19:32.300
I'm gonna have to side with chloe on this one.

19:32.710 --> 19:35.590
I wanted it in my show. it's my best picture.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.240
There's a red dot on it.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.760
Who bought it? oh, god. that feels weird.

19:43.690 --> 19:44.960
Nobody bought it.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.560
I didn't want anyone to have it,

19:48.560 --> 19:52.130
So i-i put a "sold" sticker on it.

19:58.830 --> 19:59.730
Yeah.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.160
Maybe.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.240
Out of my way! you!

20:09.670 --> 20:13.590
Oh, pooh. you're late. sorry you missed all the fun.

20:13.750 --> 20:16.810
Oh! not really. I brought my own fun.

20:18.660 --> 20:20.470
Hello, andrea. come in early tomorrow.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.920
Do you mind? I want to show you your new office.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.910
i think you're gonna like it.

20:22.910 --> 20:25.060
If you need to make a copy, it's super convenient.

20:26.610 --> 20:28.920
Okay, so you don't like practical jokes.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.520
That's good to know. that's how a friendship grows!

20:34.690 --> 20:36.450
Come on. I'll walk you out.

20:37.310 --> 20:38.580
Signals are like art--

20:39.070 --> 20:41.600
The meaning can be interpreted in countless ways,

20:41.870 --> 20:44.210
Like that statue of a giant clothespin.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.690
Actually, no one knows what that one means.

20:47.300 --> 20:50.130
But sometimes a signal is nothing like art.

20:50.470 --> 20:52.690
Its meaning is crystal clear.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.500
You have your valet ticket?

20:56.500 --> 20:58.900
Yeah, I have it right here. oh, my god. damn it!

20:58.900 --> 21:00.900
That bastard stole my wallet! I can't believe it!

21:00.900 --> 21:01.830
Oh, here it is.
