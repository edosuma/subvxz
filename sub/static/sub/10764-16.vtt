00:27.060 --> 00:28.288
Uncle Phil, please.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.660
Do you mind turning the music back on?
I'm trying to study.

00:32.465 --> 00:36.094
I'm expecting a very important client.
We have a golfing date...

00:36.169 --> 00:39.434
and I'd appreciate it
if you could study somewhere else.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.804
Okay, I get it.
You're trying to impress him.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.206
That's right.

00:43.643 --> 00:45.838
You might want to change them pants.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.240
- Good morning, sweetie.
- Hey, Aunt Viv.

00:50.316 --> 00:53.843
- What time is Jameson getting here?
- What are you wearing, Vivian?

00:53.920 --> 00:54.909
Excuse me?

00:54.988 --> 00:57.456
That red blouse.
That's Jameson's bad-luck color.

00:57.524 --> 00:59.321
This happens to be my favorite blouse...

00:59.392 --> 01:02.418
so he can just go find himself
another bad-luck color.

01:04.697 --> 01:07.757
Maybe he can pick one
out of Uncle Phil's pants.

01:10.103 --> 01:13.732
Vivian, please change.
I know he's a little superstitious...

01:13.807 --> 01:16.867
but his big account
helps to pay our little bills.

01:16.943 --> 01:19.241
All set for a great game of golf, Dad.

01:19.312 --> 01:22.577
Carlton, what is it,
recess at the clown convention?

01:24.350 --> 01:28.013
That's right. And by the way, Will,
who cut your hair, Ray Charles?

01:29.756 --> 01:33.214
I've been saving that one for a week.
Don't even try to top it.

01:34.527 --> 01:37.462
That must be Jameson.
Vivian, humor him.

01:37.897 --> 01:41.196
- Mr. Jameson Whitworth.
- Jameson, how are you?

01:41.267 --> 01:43.758
Fine. Vivian, it's lovely to see you again.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.067
And it's nice seeing you, Jameson.

01:46.506 --> 01:48.269
- How are you, Mr. Whitworth?
- Not great.

01:48.341 --> 01:51.504
My caddy called me on the car phone
a few minutes ago and canceled.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.274
I've learned my lesson: Never trust a Leo.

01:54.581 --> 01:55.809
Ain't that the truth?

01:55.882 --> 01:58.680
Back in Philly I knew this guy
named Leo Brentley.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.921
The dude tried to steal my lucky drawers.

02:05.358 --> 02:08.258
- You have a pair of lucky drawers?
- Well, yeah.

02:08.328 --> 02:12.424
- So do I.
- This is all very interesting.

02:12.899 --> 02:15.891
Carlton, you can caddy for both of us.
Shall we go, gentlemen?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.403
Wait a second.
I have a very good feeling about this.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.961
How would you like to be my caddy?

02:20.039 --> 02:22.530
I ain't down with carrying golf clubs.

02:22.609 --> 02:24.270
It's $50, plus tip.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.702
Fore!

03:42.889 --> 03:45.187
This is the worst round of golf
I've ever played.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.522
Well, the green's a little wet today.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.501
- That's what's wrong.
- What?

04:17.457 --> 04:18.856
A hole in one!

04:19.158 --> 04:21.353
I made a hole in one.
The first time in my life.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.487
- Some shot, Mr. Whitworth.
- Congratulations, Jameson.

04:24.564 --> 04:25.553
Did you see that, Will?

04:25.632 --> 04:29.033
It's because your hat's turned to the side,
you can see better.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.832
No. There's more to it than that.

04:33.239 --> 04:34.467
There is?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.708
Jameson, let me buy lunch.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.711
- A hole in one calls for a celebration.
- I'll say.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.475
I have to make it quick.
I have to get back to the office.

04:42.548 --> 04:45.312
I'm making a major investment
in Thorton Pharmaceuticals.

04:45.385 --> 04:49.253
- Maybe I'll get lucky again, Will.
- That's wack.

04:49.922 --> 04:52.652
"Wack." In what sense of the word?

04:53.192 --> 04:55.956
It's Saturday afternoon.
All you're thinking about is work.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.054
That's got to be hurting you
with the girlies.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.564
Will, please.

04:59.899 --> 05:02.766
Forget about the office,
forget about that stock.

05:02.835 --> 05:04.325
Just max and relax.

05:05.204 --> 05:06.967
Kick back and enjoy yourself.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.032
Go home and let your wife know
she's still got it.

05:10.343 --> 05:11.605
You're right.

05:12.378 --> 05:14.369
Doggone it, you're right.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.442
Doggone it, I'm right.

05:22.522 --> 05:25.958
Geoffrey, I really think I made
an impression on Mr. Whitworth.

05:26.025 --> 05:29.222
And was your sucking up
as successful as you'd hoped?

05:29.929 --> 05:31.157
I'll say.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.755
I'm gonna apply for a summer job
with his company.

05:33.833 --> 05:38.327
But, Carlton, Dad's his lawyer.
Isn't that kind of using a connection?

05:41.641 --> 05:43.040
I can't believe it, Vivian.

05:43.109 --> 05:46.044
Jameson made a hole in one,
and he's not a very good golfer.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.945
- What's his handicap, sir?
- Ain't it obvious?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.982
Everybody, the working girl is home.

05:54.587 --> 05:57.579
- How was your day?
- I love working in an art gallery.

05:57.657 --> 05:59.090
I'm learning so much.

05:59.158 --> 06:02.389
I just told my boss,
"Teach me. I'm a blank slate."

06:04.797 --> 06:06.662
At least you're honest.

06:08.568 --> 06:12.402
- What exactly do you do in this job?
- This is a very exclusive art gallery.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.906
So, they're trying to maintain
a certain atmosphere.

06:14.974 --> 06:18.171
So, when customers come in the door,
I ignore them.

06:19.045 --> 06:22.742
If they ask me about a piece of art,
I look right through them.

06:23.249 --> 06:26.150
If they ask for a price, I go like this...

06:29.155 --> 06:30.884
And walk away.

06:31.924 --> 06:34.916
Hilary, it sounds like
they hired you to be a snob.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.360
I guess they saw something in me.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.666
- Mr. Whitworth.
- Hello.

06:41.734 --> 06:45.727
- Jameson, this is a surprise.
- Actually, Philip, I'm not here to see you.

06:45.805 --> 06:49.502
- I told you I impressed him, Ashley.
- I'm here to see Will.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.566
No, sir, my name is Carlton.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.810
I know that. I'd like to see Will.

06:57.283 --> 06:58.648
I'll get him.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.650
Vivian, I brought this for you.

07:01.721 --> 07:04.121
- What is it?
- It's a sprig of wolfsbane.

07:04.190 --> 07:07.125
Hang it over your kitchen door
and all will be well.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.690
But Jameson,
everything's fine in our kitchen.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.127
That you know of.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.563
What's up, J?

07:14.634 --> 07:17.034
I'll tell you what.
You saved me a lot of money.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.092
Word?

07:18.171 --> 07:21.334
On the golf course, you told me
not to buy Thorton Pharmaceuticals.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.466
The stock dropped 10 points today.

07:23.543 --> 07:26.341
Jameson, I think you're reading
a little too much into this.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.812
I don't know nothing about stocks.
It was just luck.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.281
Precisely. You're a good-luck charm.

07:31.350 --> 07:34.581
I would've lost millions,
but thanks to my "Yo, homey" here...

07:39.492 --> 07:40.754
I didn't.

07:41.427 --> 07:45.227
So what you're saying is thanks to me,
you got lucky twice yesterday.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.231
Three times.

07:56.008 --> 07:58.875
The wife girlie will be smiling for months.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.647
You have a bright future, young man.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.309
This is no fair.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.846
There are many forces at work
in the universe, Will.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.788
For example, the power in numbers.

08:12.859 --> 08:15.327
The four arms of the Mutable Cross, Virgo.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.225
When the moon is in the seventh house.

08:17.296 --> 08:20.390
The sixth-ray energies,
Saturn to Neptune...

08:20.700 --> 08:23.134
the seventh sun, born for good luck...

08:23.536 --> 08:25.299
all numbers.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.174
Yeah.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.943
Jameson, why don't I fix you a drink?

08:35.615 --> 08:38.379
I don't drink. I like to keep my mind clear.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.852
I think he's cleared it out pretty well.

08:46.025 --> 08:49.153
My lucky numbers
have always been three and seven.

08:49.495 --> 08:52.953
- Will, when's your birthday?
- July 3.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.499
- What year?
- 1973.

08:59.205 --> 09:03.574
So you were born on 7-3-73...

09:04.143 --> 09:05.667
my lucky numbers.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.713
Jameson, that's just a coincidence.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.941
Coincidence? I don't think so.

09:11.551 --> 09:15.544
- I was born August 4, 1974.
- A Leo?

09:21.928 --> 09:24.260
Will, I have an assignment for you.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.257
I want you to go through these files.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.197
They're about a company
called Innermark.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.167
I've been analyzing the data for months...

09:30.236 --> 09:32.397
trying to decide
whether or not I should buy it.

09:32.471 --> 09:33.904
You want me to read all this?

09:33.973 --> 09:36.237
That's not necessary. Just feel the pages.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.834
Tell me what kind of energy you get back.

09:38.911 --> 09:43.314
Jameson, I have to say
this all sounds a little...

09:43.482 --> 09:44.676
Insane?

09:47.053 --> 09:48.418
...unorthodox.

09:48.487 --> 09:51.320
You have an excellent brokerage firm
to advise you.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.450
J, straight up, I don't know
nothing about this stuff.

09:54.794 --> 09:57.194
Will, you don't know that you know...

09:57.263 --> 09:59.458
but believe me, you know.

10:02.301 --> 10:03.734
Man, I don't know.

10:05.004 --> 10:07.131
Exactly. We'll talk tomorrow.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.071
Philip, Vivian, have a nice day.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.075
Why is that man running loose
on the streets without medication?

10:18.584 --> 10:22.020
He's a little eccentric, Vivian,
but he has a brilliant financial mind.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.817
He does?

10:23.889 --> 10:26.187
Philip, why don't you tell Will
about Sparky?

10:26.258 --> 10:28.556
I don't think we need to go into that.

10:28.894 --> 10:29.918
Last year...

10:29.996 --> 10:33.124
Jameson was taking all of his stock advice
from his dog.

10:33.332 --> 10:35.129
That's untrue, Vivian.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.232
He only took tax advice from Sparky.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.462
Then, last spring...

10:41.540 --> 10:44.270
Sparky met with an untimely run-in
with a milk truck...

10:44.343 --> 10:47.608
but of course, that didn't stop Jameson
from talking to him.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.747
He talks to the spirit of a dead dog?

10:51.450 --> 10:52.644
No.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.786
He had him stuffed and put in his office.

10:56.722 --> 10:58.986
Uncle Phil, why do you humor this guy?

10:59.058 --> 11:01.959
The planet he's on
ain't even been discovered yet.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.352
He's an important client...

11:04.430 --> 11:07.888
and he's just entrusted you
with a very serious financial decision.

11:07.967 --> 11:11.425
- This has got to be handled delicately.
- What am I supposed to do?

11:11.504 --> 11:14.564
Tomorrow, you to go down
to Whitworth's Capital Investments...

11:14.640 --> 11:18.269
find Jameson Whitworth and tell him
that you're a 17-year-old kid...

11:18.344 --> 11:20.938
and you're in no position
to give financial advice.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.208
Exactly. That's Sparky's job.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.925
Your main man is in effect, Mr. Whitworth.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.591
Thank you, Gladys. Will, come in.

11:40.066 --> 11:41.761
What's going on, J?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.806
You know, I just wanted to come so...

11:52.945 --> 11:54.674
Is something wrong, Will?

11:55.948 --> 11:56.937
No.

11:58.851 --> 12:02.514
Look, I'm a little pressed for time,
so let's just get right to the point.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.182
Excellent. All right, Will,
Innermark Industries.

12:05.257 --> 12:06.884
Do we buy this stock or not?

12:07.226 --> 12:10.127
Look, that's what I came
to talk to you about.

12:11.197 --> 12:14.928
I don't think I'm in any position
to give you financial advice.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.433
I'm only 17.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.134
Did you say 17?

12:20.106 --> 12:22.870
This is a sign. Will, look at this.

12:23.275 --> 12:25.038
This machine gives me stock quotes.

12:25.111 --> 12:28.012
What price has Innermark
been trading at all day?

12:30.216 --> 12:31.240
Seventeen.

12:32.618 --> 12:34.245
You've done it again, Will.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.015
I'm calling my broker.

12:36.655 --> 12:39.146
Wait, I really don't think you should...

12:40.025 --> 12:44.223
Miles? Buy me one million shares
of Innermark Industries. Right.

12:44.997 --> 12:46.089
Done.

12:47.366 --> 12:50.494
You bought a million shares of stock
because I told you I was 17?

12:50.569 --> 12:52.036
That's right.

12:53.072 --> 12:57.031
This is just one big coincidence.
Besides, I'm about to turn 18.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.842
- Did you say 18?
- No.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.839
Yes, you did.

13:05.651 --> 13:09.747
Look at this, Will.
The stock just went up to $18.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.991
You just made me $1 million.

13:13.225 --> 13:15.625
That doesn't mean anything,
Mr. Whitworth.

13:15.694 --> 13:18.094
I can understand you being frightened
by your powers.

13:18.164 --> 13:21.497
But there are forces at work
in the universe beyond our understanding.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.228
Don't fight them, Will.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.667
Learn to accept them...

13:24.737 --> 13:27.433
and there will always be
a place for you here.

13:34.446 --> 13:36.676
You know, Will's been gone for hours.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.343
I wonder how his meeting
with Mr. Whitworth is going.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.817
Nothing to worry about, Ashley.

13:40.886 --> 13:43.980
Traffic from Mars is very heavy
this time of day.

13:45.057 --> 13:47.491
I'm home. Carlton, get the camera.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.688
I want a picture of me
opening my first paycheck.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.561
- Congratulations, baby.
- That's wonderful.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.630
I'm so excited.

13:55.701 --> 13:58.169
Mom, Dad, I'll start paying
my own way around here...

13:58.237 --> 14:00.137
and I won't accept no for an answer.

14:00.206 --> 14:03.437
You still owe me $5
for those magazines you bought.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.306
Ashley, don't be petty.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.976
- All set.
- Here goes.

14:10.049 --> 14:12.540
Don't you all feel like a part of history?

14:13.752 --> 14:14.810
What?

14:16.422 --> 14:18.754
Federal taxes? This is an outrage.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.523
Didn't President Bush say,
"No new taxes"?

14:21.594 --> 14:23.585
But federal taxes aren't new.

14:23.662 --> 14:27.689
They are to me. And who is this FICA guy?

14:30.669 --> 14:33.365
Hilary, taxes are taken
out of everybody's salary.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.636
They pay for highways, national defense,
and housing programs.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.940
I thought the government was supposed
to pay for all that.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.344
Okay, I know the solution.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.507
I'm going to demand a raise.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.414
Hilary, you've only been there a week.

14:46.485 --> 14:47.975
Nobody starts at the top.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.629
Yeah. Lunch on the company yacht?

15:00.065 --> 15:02.124
Yeah, that sounds great, Jameson.

15:02.201 --> 15:05.329
Let's say you have the limo
pick me up noon-ish.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.734
Yeah, all right. Peace back at you, babe.

15:16.515 --> 15:20.178
Will, I want you to return all that stuff
before the cops get here.

15:22.521 --> 15:23.715
What are you tripping?

15:23.789 --> 15:26.451
J gave me this stuff
as a little thank-you gift.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.494
- For what?
- I made him $1 million.

15:29.561 --> 15:33.497
That may seem like a lot, Will,
but wait till they take out all the taxes.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.130
Will, how did you make Jameson
$1 million?

15:37.803 --> 15:39.964
To be honest, I have no idea.

15:40.839 --> 15:42.807
Jameson seems to think I'm good luck.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.343
Will, there's no such thing
as good luck or bad luck.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.777
Yes, there is. I've got bad luck.

15:50.582 --> 15:53.016
You look handsome, Will. Nice suit.

15:53.085 --> 15:55.383
You like it, Ash? Custom-made.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.183
Size 42, extra fly.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.889
When you work for Whitworth,
you get all the fringe benefits.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.793
Does he need a butler?

16:06.432 --> 16:08.627
Just asking. For a friend.

16:11.003 --> 16:15.463
Will, you don't really think you're capable
of giving financial advice, do you?

16:15.541 --> 16:16.735
Aunt Viv...

16:17.309 --> 16:21.837
there are forces at work in this universe
that are beyond our understanding.

16:22.614 --> 16:25.549
And if these forces
want to give me a limo...

16:25.617 --> 16:28.381
a cellular phone, and an Armani suit...

16:28.654 --> 16:30.622
who are we to argue with them?

16:35.260 --> 16:38.889
Will, I sent you there to get out
of this arrangement with Jameson...

16:38.964 --> 16:41.364
and now you're in deeper than before.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.628
I know. I just feel terrible.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.499
Am I showing enough cuff?

16:48.540 --> 16:51.407
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna put an end to this.

16:53.545 --> 16:56.013
Yes, Philip Banks for Jameson Whitworth.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.542
Yes, I've been talking to Will here.

17:00.619 --> 17:03.213
First of all, I'd like to say
he's very flattered...

17:03.322 --> 17:07.019
but it's a little risky having a high-school
student give financial advice.

17:07.092 --> 17:10.084
As your lawyer,
I'd advise you put an end to it.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.457
Sure, you want to talk
to him yourself? Okay.

17:17.269 --> 17:19.328
Yo, J. What up, coolie-bop?

17:22.508 --> 17:23.667
Really?

17:24.576 --> 17:25.770
Really?

17:26.078 --> 17:28.876
Yeah, if that's the way you want it,
that's cool.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.073
All right. Peace.

17:32.484 --> 17:33.883
What did he say?

17:33.952 --> 17:35.715
Uncle Phil, you're fired.

17:47.299 --> 17:49.995
So, is Mr. Whitworth ready to see us yet?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.833
He's still in there talking to his homey.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.930
You'll just have to chill.

17:57.976 --> 18:00.570
All right. We can't afford
to lose Whitworth's account.

18:00.646 --> 18:04.013
- We need a game plan.
- I thought we had agreed on groveling.

18:04.716 --> 18:08.208
Yes, but we need to straighten out
the order in which we grovel.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.153
I'll go first.

18:10.222 --> 18:13.749
Since my father founded the law firm,
I can make an emotional plea.

18:13.826 --> 18:17.284
Philip, you can remind him of all our
dedicated service to his company.

18:17.362 --> 18:19.421
- What do I say?
- Nothing.

18:20.065 --> 18:22.932
You're only here because
his lucky number is three.

18:23.735 --> 18:25.066
Of course.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.566
J, come on, man,
you've got to meet with them.

18:29.641 --> 18:32.542
- They're sitting right outside.
- Straight up, pop.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.909
I'm sorry, but the aura is wack.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.182
What did you say, Sparky?

18:39.418 --> 18:42.581
He's talking? He hasn't talked in weeks.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.588
You think it's a good idea
to have the meeting?

18:47.826 --> 18:49.088
Word?

18:52.364 --> 18:54.992
What's that? Go ahead with the meeting?

18:55.067 --> 18:57.035
Send them in right away.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.996
There you have it.
Sparky says have the meeting.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.206
Well, all right.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.367
It's two against one.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.379
Gladys, send them in, please.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.751
- Jameson, good to see you.
- Have a seat.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.980
- Will, excuse us, please.
- Sure.

19:16.054 --> 19:19.717
He stays. I want him here.
Sparky wants him here.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.259
Okay.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.923
Jameson, Furth, Wind & Meyer
has represented you...

19:26.999 --> 19:28.489
for the past 20 years.

19:28.567 --> 19:31.058
And I think I speak for all the lawyers
in the firm...

19:31.136 --> 19:35.004
when I say that we're dedicated
to continuing in that capacity.

19:35.407 --> 19:37.375
So? Lawyers are a dime a dozen.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.740
There's some truth in that.

19:43.649 --> 19:46.550
You had an interesting point
you wanted to make, didn't you?

19:46.618 --> 19:47.949
Yes, Henry.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.148
Jameson, to elaborate
on what Henry was saying, it...

19:53.625 --> 19:55.752
Yes? What?

19:56.762 --> 19:58.252
This is terrible.

19:58.597 --> 20:01.157
- What's the matter?
- That was my broker.

20:01.233 --> 20:04.725
Innermark stock is plummeting.
It's already down 10 points.

20:06.572 --> 20:09.063
My God, it's already down to $6 a share.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.666
It's down to $5, $4, $3...

20:11.743 --> 20:14.041
Great. That's your lucky number.

20:15.247 --> 20:19.240
I just lost a fortune.
Will, you owe me $14 million.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.851
Here's $5.

20:23.822 --> 20:25.847
This is serious. Don't you know anything?

20:25.924 --> 20:28.449
No. How many times do I have to tell you?

20:28.527 --> 20:31.462
Why did you tell me to buy that stock?
You're out of your mind.

20:31.530 --> 20:32.724
I'm out of my mind?

20:32.965 --> 20:35.991
You're the one that's got Lassie
as your vice president.

20:38.103 --> 20:41.766
You're not lucky. You're unlucky.
You're a curse. Get out of my office.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.831
- Don't you talk to him like that.
- Excuse me?

20:43.909 --> 20:46.207
It's your fault he's involved in this.

20:46.278 --> 20:49.941
This isn't the first time that your craziness
has got us in hot water.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.279
Last January, on my birthday...

20:52.351 --> 20:55.445
when I could have been home
with my wife and family, where was I?

20:55.520 --> 20:57.715
Stuck in the office
buried under paperwork...

20:57.789 --> 20:59.313
because Sparky chased a Buick...

20:59.391 --> 21:03.521
and you thought that was his way
of telling you to take over General Motors.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.587
Jameson, I am through
with your craziness.

21:06.665 --> 21:10.294
If that means we lose
a $20 million account, then so be it.

21:11.503 --> 21:15.701
Jameson, I think that's Philip's way
of saying "I'm sorry."

21:18.610 --> 21:21.443
- Why didn't you ever say this before?
- I should have.

21:21.513 --> 21:25.142
Absolutely. I had no idea
your birthday was in January.

21:25.984 --> 21:27.713
You're a Capricorn.

21:28.620 --> 21:32.147
My horoscope says
a Capricorn will lead me to prosperity.

21:32.224 --> 21:35.421
Philip, you're just the goat
I've been looking for.

21:35.994 --> 21:38.622
Gentlemen, welcome back.

21:44.603 --> 21:47.572
The way you stood up for me, Uncle Phil,
you were all that.

21:47.639 --> 21:51.166
- I didn't like the way he was treating you.
- So what happened next?

21:51.243 --> 21:53.905
Uncle Phil told him
he could take his big account...

21:53.979 --> 21:57.574
fold it five ways and stick it
where Sparky can't find it.

21:58.617 --> 22:02.109
- Wow, Dad, that took guts.
- Well done, sir.

22:02.187 --> 22:04.747
You know, I've always wished
I had the nerve...

22:04.823 --> 22:06.791
to tell off my employers.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.862
Daddy, you've been
a wonderful example for me.

22:15.934 --> 22:19.028
How much abuse can one person take
for the sake of a job?

22:19.104 --> 22:21.572
There are lots of things about my boss
that bug me.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.234
And I've been putting up with him
for a whole week.

22:24.309 --> 22:26.072
It's time to take action.

22:27.045 --> 22:30.071
Hilary, I don't want you
to go screaming at your boss.

22:30.148 --> 22:31.376
Can you?

22:33.185 --> 22:36.052
Philip, I am really proud of you.

22:36.988 --> 22:40.321
Life is too short to put up with
the Jameson Whitworths of the world.

22:40.392 --> 22:41.916
Straight up, Uncle Phil.

22:41.993 --> 22:44.291
I can't believe that loon
changed his mind...

22:44.363 --> 22:46.297
because you told him
you were a Capricorn.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.129
Capricorn? Philip,
your birthday's January 30.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.259
You're an Aquarius.

22:50.335 --> 22:53.793
Vivian, for a $20 million account,
I'm a Capricorn.
