WEBVTT

01:00.920 --> 01:02.320
Sorry.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.240
<i>You lied to us!</i>

01:14.640 --> 01:16.600
About Carol Fincher.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.040
You arranged a meeting
via a dating website.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.400
I did.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.120
I lied.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.000
And when I realised
she was an ex-employee, I backed off.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.120
Nothing happened.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.560
But you deleted the account
after talking to us.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.720
Why?

01:36.080 --> 01:37.400
I have affairs.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.600
A couple of years ago,
for financial reasons,

01:40.680 --> 01:42.800
I signed over half the company to my wife.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.840
And, as you know,
there's nothing more...

01:45.760 --> 01:46.800
greedy...

01:47.560 --> 01:49.040
than a deceived woman.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.520
Just when I thought
I couldn't like you any less.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.880
What were you doing
on Wednesday night?

01:55.960 --> 01:57.000
This Wednesday?

01:57.080 --> 01:59.520
Between midnight and 8:00 a.m.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.280
I was at home with my wife.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.160
You were seen leaving
a black Fiesta on Hampstead Heath.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.720
You're lying.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.720
And I'm sick of being lied to.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.240
Rav.
It's him.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.160
Is he cooperating?
-It looks like it.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.360
He's offered us unrestricted access

02:57.440 --> 02:59.640
to his email, bank details,
travel itineraries...

02:59.720 --> 03:00.720
What was he doing on the Heath?

03:00.800 --> 03:02.040
Doing what he's always doing, I reckon,

03:02.120 --> 03:04.680
being a cheating dickhead.
But this time with a Kassia Beckworth.

03:04.760 --> 03:08.400
Good. Well, hold him, keep me in the loop,
and dig into his alibi.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.640
I'll get forensics
to look at Kassia Beckworth's Fiesta.

03:10.720 --> 03:11.720
Later.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.680
Come with me, both of you.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.720
Can you shut the door?

03:27.920 --> 03:30.040
You said you didn't know.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.640
About Grace Gibson and your husband.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.080
I didn't. Not until Tim told me.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.800
So why'd you access CCTV
outside her house?

03:39.160 --> 03:40.920
-I was asked.
-No.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.840
Not almost 72 hours before
anyone knew she was dead.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.280
I was helping DI Williamson.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.880
I knew that she was listed
as missing at that time.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.160
-No.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.200
I was learning about the system.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.040
I thought I might as well
do something useful.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.560
So you knew nothing
about Jason and Grace Gibson?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.320
Before she was killed?

04:00.400 --> 04:02.200
Not at the time, no.

04:02.280 --> 04:03.320
Did it lead anywhere?

04:03.400 --> 04:04.840
Sorry, what is this?

04:04.920 --> 04:07.160
No minicab or delivery van?

04:07.240 --> 04:09.320
Like the other crime scenes.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.640
-I wasn't looking for those then.
Look for them now.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.560
Check all the CCTV footage
the night of Grace's murder again.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.880
Immediately.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.120
Hey!

04:30.120 --> 04:31.640
Hiya!

04:32.640 --> 04:34.960
-What a surprise!

04:35.040 --> 04:36.720
Do you live here?

04:36.800 --> 04:37.800
What are you doing here?

04:37.880 --> 04:40.280
Well, I've just been seeing
a friend up the road.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.520
Yeah, so where are you off to?

04:41.600 --> 04:43.000
Do you fancy grabbing
a coffee or something?

04:43.080 --> 04:46.320
I'd love to,
but I'm already running late.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.400
You know, I... I could think
that you're trying to avoid me.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.480
No, don't think that.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.000
I've just got this lecture
and I can't miss it.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.520
-You can walk with me, though.
-Great.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.800
So is everyone nice to you here?

05:04.800 --> 05:05.880
At uni?

05:06.800 --> 05:08.440
Everyone treat you all right?

05:09.480 --> 05:10.880
Yeah, they do.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.560
I don't know.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.440
I really care about you.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.440
Anyway, Peter,
thanks for keeping me company.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.280
-My pleasure.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.000
Oh, hang on.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.520
I almost forgot.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.560
I hope you like it.

05:31.640 --> 05:32.680
Oh.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.560
Thank you.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.440
What do you say to having dinner together?

05:42.120 --> 05:44.400
Yeah!
Yeah, we should fix something up.

05:44.480 --> 05:45.480
Yeah?

05:46.520 --> 05:47.920
Definitely.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.080
Good.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.040
I'll see you, Peter.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.320
See ya.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.480
Oh...

08:50.840 --> 08:53.200
Don't...

08:57.480 --> 08:59.360
Does this look overdressed?

08:59.440 --> 09:00.440
For what?

09:00.520 --> 09:03.200
I'm meeting Andrew Barnes
about Lambeth today.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.560
Can't you postpone that,

09:04.640 --> 09:06.840
so we could go somewhere,
you and I?

09:08.320 --> 09:10.600
Take care of each other,
have a few days off.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.240
I don't take days off.

09:14.760 --> 09:16.200
Is Henry going to be there?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.480
No, why?

09:19.440 --> 09:21.520
Well, he's familiar with the project.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.840
-Knows what Barnes wants to hear.

09:23.920 --> 09:27.120
It's not his fault
we're in the position we're in, you know.

09:28.760 --> 09:32.040
He warned you about Lambeth.
So did Grace.

09:36.040 --> 09:39.080
You let your personal feelings
about Henry get in the way.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.520
He irritates me.
Always has.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.960
Maybe you should change.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.960
That doesn't do you any favours.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.080
I inspected
the Lambeth site earlier.

09:59.160 --> 10:03.040
I'm afraid I have no choice than to issue
you with a fail notice, Mrs Gibson.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.880
On what grounds?

10:04.960 --> 10:07.280
Green space,
accessibility, sustainability.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.840
You're breaking our planning agreement
on almost every point.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.280
Well, in our view these changes
were made well within its parameters.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.320
You've got until Monday

10:16.400 --> 10:19.360
to submit a proposal detailing
whatever measures you'll be taking.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.800
Or else we'll shut it down.

10:21.560 --> 10:25.520
And you risk being blacklisted
from any further contracts on public land.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.960
Surely there must be another way
we can solve this?

10:30.040 --> 10:31.520
That benefits both of us.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.560
I'm not sure I follow you, Mrs Gibson.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.640
I think you do.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.160
I hope I don't.

10:40.200 --> 10:45.360
Erm, we've been going through
a very difficult time recently.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.000
I'm sure you've heard
about my sister.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.920
I'm really sorry for your loss,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.360
but you can't ask me to ignore
our planning regulations.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.800
No, of course not,

10:54.880 --> 10:57.640
but given everything that's happened
with Grace and how it's affecting us,

10:57.720 --> 11:00.680
I think we would definitely benefit
from more time.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.960
Your personal situation is why
you're getting till Monday.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.560
I'm sorry.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.040
What an awful little man.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.280
I'll bring someone in to...

11:19.360 --> 11:20.920
have a look at this.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.800
Why don't you do it?

11:27.800 --> 11:28.840
Me?

11:28.920 --> 11:30.320
Yes, you.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.040
Sure. Yeah.
Absolutely.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.440
I, erm...

11:38.880 --> 11:40.960
Yeah, I'd love to.
Thank you.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.440
I, erm...

13:36.360 --> 13:38.680
I was just checking up on the place.

13:38.760 --> 13:41.600
Sylvie wants it on the market
as soon as possible.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.880
I'm just collecting
some of Grace's things.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.160
I miss her, too, you know.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.840
Here we go.
Here we go.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.440
Oh. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.640
-Sit.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.840
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?

14:20.920 --> 14:22.600
-Oh.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.280
What's the matter?

14:28.280 --> 14:29.920
Hey! Hey!

14:38.120 --> 14:40.400
He should be here any minute.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.560
Hassan El

15:06.160 --> 15:07.600
DS Marcella Backland. Can I have a word?

15:12.400 --> 15:13.880
Your vehicle was parked

15:13.960 --> 15:16.360
at the junction of Hallum Street
and Ferndell Road

15:16.440 --> 15:19.840
last Wednesday between 22:50 and 23:25.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.920
So?

15:21.960 --> 15:25.000
So, a murder was carried out
around that time.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.160
A murder?

15:30.880 --> 15:31.880
No, sorry.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.640
Your car was parked for 35 minutes,

15:34.720 --> 15:36.360
you didn't see anything?

15:36.440 --> 15:39.760
No man or woman leaving the house?

15:39.840 --> 15:41.160
Thirty

15:41.240 --> 15:43.960
Did I pick up or leave a ride?
-No.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.000
Hmm, no. Ah, oh,
I was, er, on my break then.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.280
I was probably trying to sleep.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.400
Sorry.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.720
-I wish I could be more help.
-Thanks.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.160
That's very helpful. Thanks.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.200
<i>The taxi arrives</i>
<i>outside Grace's house at 22:51.</i>

16:05.280 --> 16:09.040
And he stays there
for the next 37 minutes, till 23:28.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.760
It's all logged...

16:11.920 --> 16:13.040
here.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.680
So the driver might've seen something.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.920
No, I already spoke to him.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.080
His name is Hassan El-Sayed.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.840
He was on a break, taking a nap.
Nothing suspicious.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.680
There's been another attack.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.880
Looks like our killer.
Need you all down there now.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.080
Now.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.480
<i>Can you give us a description?</i>

16:36.560 --> 16:38.280
He was all in black.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.240
It was over in seconds.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.400
And then I found these.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.440
What did he want?

16:46.520 --> 16:48.520
Can you tell me
about your movements today?

16:48.600 --> 16:53.400
Yes, I went down to the swimming pool
from senior swimming session

16:53.480 --> 16:56.880
and then, I stopped off at Dusan's...

16:57.880 --> 16:59.240
to pick up the dog.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.760
Er, who's Dusan?
Is that the dog

17:02.840 --> 17:05.760
No.  I'm his.

17:05.840 --> 17:09.280
Sorry, Mr Davies, so you're saying
that there's usually no dog in the house?

17:09.360 --> 17:10.400
No.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.680
No.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.920
What do you think he was up to?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.720
-Found this.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.040
I don't know, it's unmarked.

17:20.120 --> 17:21.480
It was by the wall where he jumped.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.680
-We've got a footprint. Size nine.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.160
We should have the make
and brand in an hour or so.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.640
And that's Cullen.
Cullen's a size nine.

17:28.720 --> 17:29.840
Oh, God.
So are ten million others.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.120
He's out now.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.480
We don't know the last time
Guy Roberts left him unattended.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.920
Clive Bonn's at the station.
We haven't got anything else.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.520
It's not enough to bring him in.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.960
Rav, please.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.280
What about an invitation?

17:41.360 --> 17:42.480
Off the record!

17:42.560 --> 17:44.280
Give me one last chance with Cullen.

17:45.320 --> 17:46.400
All right, fine.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.760
If you get him to talk, you bring him in.

17:50.760 --> 17:51.880
-Thanks.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.880
Yeah.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.960
Yeah, it was great.
It was good.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.480
Erm...

19:06.480 --> 19:07.560
I've been thinking...

19:08.600 --> 19:09.960
about Bendek.

19:10.960 --> 19:14.080
-I'm not really happy having him here.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.880
-Oh, no, no. I just, erm...

19:20.080 --> 19:22.320
I don't know.
I just don't feel comfortable

19:22.400 --> 19:24.040
with someone being in the house.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.600
Well, he's all right.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.960
We need the money.

19:31.040 --> 19:34.240
Thing is, we don't.
Not really.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.800
Well, like I said, you know...

19:39.200 --> 19:41.320
It's good to save a little bit.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.360
You know, for the future.
I mean, anything can happen.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.520
Like what?

19:46.520 --> 19:48.080
Well, like, anything.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.920
I don't want you to worry.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.960
<i>This is Ade. You know what to do!</i>

20:45.680 --> 20:47.880
<i>Hey, Adrian, it's me.</i>

20:49.440 --> 20:51.360
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

20:52.880 --> 20:54.360
<i>Call me.</i>

21:05.840 --> 21:08.720
Where were you between
11:00 and 1:00 today?

21:09.960 --> 21:13.240
What, that's it?
Straight to the point?

21:14.480 --> 21:16.560
You're not gonna offer me
anything to drink?

21:17.560 --> 21:19.480
-Tea, please.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.440
With milk.

21:27.640 --> 21:28.760
Why did you do it?

21:29.800 --> 21:31.480
Why did I do what?

21:33.280 --> 21:35.200
Come here voluntarily.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.880
I'm out of prison.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.560
I've paid my debt to society,
and I'm trying to start anew.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.600
You know, the sooner you realise
that you're wrong,

21:44.680 --> 21:47.400
the better for me
and the other people around me.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.400
With Maddy Stevenson?

21:52.680 --> 21:55.320
You're ruining my chances
of a normal life.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.280
Where were you between
11:00 and 1:00 today?

22:12.640 --> 22:13.720
Out walking.

22:14.640 --> 22:17.440
-Enjoying my freedom.
-You're gonna have to do better than that.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.840
Can I have your shoe?

22:21.080 --> 22:22.240
Your shoe.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.880
I need to photograph it.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.480
The sole.

22:40.040 --> 22:43.920
If you're going to keep them,
I need some new ones to go home with.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.160
Sorry to hear about the dog.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.120
You can put your shoe back on.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.560
I'm guessing all this has to do
with whatever happened

22:54.640 --> 22:55.880
between 11:00 and 1:00 today.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.440
We're gonna need to get into yours.

22:57.520 --> 23:01.280
I need your keys,
or is it a key card?

23:07.960 --> 23:10.960
This is the last time
I'm helping you, Marcella.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.240
Now you stay away from me.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.960
Or what... Peter?

24:12.480 --> 24:14.480
Why?

24:27.960 --> 24:29.360
So how's everything going?

24:30.160 --> 24:31.320
I'm good.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.760
Better.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.480
And Jason?

24:40.560 --> 24:41.760
Fired.
-Yeah.

24:45.120 --> 24:47.680
Yeah, it's a real...
it's a real pity.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.440
Erm...

25:09.280 --> 25:10.760
Have I missed my moment?

25:12.920 --> 25:14.720
There was a moment, was there?

25:18.760 --> 25:21.720
-I wasn't really in a good place.
-I know.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.400
And that's why I didn't act on it.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.720
Is that why you've come?

25:28.560 --> 25:30.960
I'm here because I still care about you.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.680
-Thanks.
-Mmm.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.320
I'll see you tomorrow.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.800
What was he doing here?

26:02.400 --> 26:03.520
What happened?

26:05.080 --> 26:06.800
Jason, what happened?

26:09.800 --> 26:11.840
I haven't felt anything since the morgue.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.280
I needed to feel something.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.000
So I paid someone to hit me.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.040
It worked.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.360
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

26:33.320 --> 26:34.960
I never meant to hurt you.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.640
Well, what did you think getting
your new girlfriend knocked up

26:37.720 --> 26:39.000
would do to me?

26:40.480 --> 26:42.080
You take those,

26:42.160 --> 26:43.920
wait till they kick in...

26:44.000 --> 26:45.960
and I'll drive you back to Greg's.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.320
Hi, how are you?
Hi. Good.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.560
What, er, are you doing here?
You looking for Matthew?

27:11.640 --> 27:12.680
No.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.840
What do you think of me?

27:20.680 --> 27:24.320
I like you. You're, er...
you're good for Matthew.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.440
Why?

27:26.480 --> 27:28.560
It's just that we both care about him

27:28.640 --> 27:32.040
and I just thought it would be good
if we were friends.

27:32.120 --> 27:34.320
Oh, God, I thought we were.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.120
Yeah, better friends.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.480
Sure, yeah. Yeah.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.000
-I'm sure we can work on it.
-Good, good.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.480
You got a moment right now?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.160
Yeah, sure.
-Excellent. All right. Good.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.720
Are you serious?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.560
Yeah, Matthew said that
you weren't allowed to see her.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.960
At the morgue.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.480
You need closure, believe me.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.040
What the hell do you know about it?

28:58.560 --> 28:59.840
You okay?

29:03.600 --> 29:04.720
Yeah.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.880
Better than I expected.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.480
Thanks.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.040
Sylvie showed some confidence
in me yesterday.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.840
That's good.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.240
Yeah, that's good.

29:56.280 --> 29:58.720
I want my job back.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.960
Well, you should have
thought of that before you started--

30:01.040 --> 30:03.680
Before I started a relationship
with Grace. Yeah, I know.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.520
But that's not what we did, though.

30:05.600 --> 30:08.480
We loved each other.
She's dead.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.960
Now I have nothing.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.400
So I really need this job.

30:12.480 --> 30:16.560
Before you started lying to me,
was what I was about to say.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.200
We didn't lie, Sylvie.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.480
We just didn't tell the truth.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.680
-Oh, quit the lawyer bullshit--
-Sylvie.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.560
This wasn't work.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.360
We didn't want you to know.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.440
I want my job back.

30:33.520 --> 30:37.760
No. You don't get things in life, Jason.
You earn them.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.240
Er, listen,

30:55.320 --> 30:57.480
Jason, it must have seemed a bit--

30:57.560 --> 31:00.280
-What the hell!
-Shut it.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.360
-Yeah. Yeah, you are.

31:05.040 --> 31:08.560
But I wonder what Sylvie would say
about the way you do it.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.560
Now tell me about the company.

31:15.680 --> 31:17.000
Where are we with Clive Bonn?

31:17.080 --> 31:19.640
Kassia Beckworth,
she did pick him up at the Heath

31:19.720 --> 31:20.880
and they had sex.

31:20.960 --> 31:24.520
We've had a preliminary report
on Ms Beckworth's Fiesta from forensics.

31:24.600 --> 31:28.520
A 1.6L Ti-VCT Duratec I-4 engine.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.720
Black as we know.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.600
-Mileage was just under 3,000--
-Oh, Jesus, Mark. Mark.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.520
Is there anything of interest in there?

31:35.600 --> 31:36.680
Yeah, erm...

31:36.760 --> 31:38.680
No signs of damage
to the glass or metalwork,

31:38.760 --> 31:42.200
no signs of repairs,
and no traces of blood.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.640
Marcella, you with us?

31:44.640 --> 31:47.000
But we know it wasn't
the car that hit Cara.

31:47.080 --> 31:50.960
And Bonn was here during
the attempted attack on Walter Davies.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.560
Has anyone got anything
on the white plastic card

31:53.640 --> 31:55.200
that was found in Davies' garden?

31:55.280 --> 31:56.600
Short version...

31:56.680 --> 31:59.120
it's incredibly hard
to retrieve information from them,

31:59.200 --> 32:00.920
so I've asked a hacker friend
to help me out.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.560
And there was nothing on the minicab?

32:02.640 --> 32:04.800
We got the DNA results back
from the Gibson house.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.200
Blood type O.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.320
-Cullen was O.
He's also a man.

32:08.400 --> 32:11.440
The blood's from a woman.
There's no match on the DNA database.

32:13.840 --> 32:17.360
Get DNA samples from every woman
that might have been in that house.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.080
Oh, surely you've done yours by now?

32:20.160 --> 32:22.080
I never went to the house.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.840
Doesn't matter.
Nurse's office, second floor.

32:26.720 --> 32:28.280
Marcella.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.840
Wait here.
I'll return the car for you.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.200
Thanks, brother.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.800
The driver is called Sergei,
and he will text you when he's outside.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.800
-Thank you.
-No worries.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.400
So let me confirm the address with you.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.400
Thanks, brother.

33:47.360 --> 33:51.240
The police had a talk with me yesterday.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.760
Nothing about immigration,
just about last Wednesday night.

33:53.840 --> 33:58.160
You were parked at the junction of
Hallum Street and Ferndell Road

33:58.240 --> 34:00.440
for 35 minutes.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.320
What about it?

34:02.400 --> 34:03.520
Someone was murdered,

34:03.600 --> 34:05.280
in a house you could have seen
from the car.

34:05.360 --> 34:06.720
They thought it was me.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.320
Wow, shit! Seriously!

34:08.400 --> 34:10.240
That's what it was.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.680
What

34:12.760 --> 34:14.960
Some woman, came out,
backed her car up

34:15.040 --> 34:17.160
and dragged something heavy
over to it and drove off.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.120
A woman? Yes, a woman.
What's wrong with you?

34:20.320 --> 34:21.520
I saw her with my own eyes.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.040
Look, move!

34:23.120 --> 34:24.160
What's wrong with you?

34:24.240 --> 34:25.360
Go home and hide.
The police spoke to me.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.360
What do you mean the police...

34:37.720 --> 34:39.840
This is for my dog, you bastard!

35:53.320 --> 35:54.640
-Hi.
-Hey.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.320
Thanks.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.440
What's Vannux?

35:58.520 --> 36:00.920
Erm, it's er,

36:01.000 --> 36:02.600
antidepressant.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.360
Why are you looking at that?

36:05.440 --> 36:07.480
It's just research for the client.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.680
So, erm...

36:10.800 --> 36:13.360
it has nothing to do
with what you said before?

36:13.440 --> 36:15.400
You're okay?
I mean, we're okay?

36:15.480 --> 36:17.120
Yeah.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.000
-Okay.
Oh, Bendek!

36:20.960 --> 36:22.600
Is that you?

36:37.800 --> 36:39.560
Can't even be bothered to say hello.

36:39.640 --> 36:42.400
Well, if you gotta go,
you gotta go.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.800
Come on.

37:16.600 --> 37:17.720
Sorry.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.680
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry...

37:23.760 --> 37:25.120
It's all right, are you okay?

37:25.200 --> 37:26.240
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

37:26.320 --> 37:27.960
Excuse me for a second.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.520
<i>Maddy, you all right?</i>

38:00.600 --> 38:02.240
Sorry to bother you, I'm just...

38:03.280 --> 38:04.560
I'm just getting a bit freaked out.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.160
About what?

38:06.240 --> 38:08.880
<i>I haven't heard from my boyfriend in days.</i>

38:08.960 --> 38:11.480
Right, does Peter know about him?

38:11.560 --> 38:13.600
No, I don't think so.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.600
<i>-Yeah.</i>

38:16.680 --> 38:19.760
And he gave me this perfume.
It's my favourite.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.880
<i>Adrian normally buys it for me.</i>

38:22.920 --> 38:24.680
Where are you right now?

38:24.760 --> 38:26.800
<i>Hang on a minute,</i>
<i>the lights are on.</i>

38:26.880 --> 38:28.960
It must be Adrian.
I'll call you back.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.320
<i>Look, you can call me anytime,</i>

38:30.400 --> 38:32.360
but, Maddy, you've got to listen to me--

38:38.840 --> 38:40.640
Can you get eyes
on Peter Cullen for me now?

38:41.880 --> 38:43.160
Adrian?

38:46.280 --> 38:48.320
You could have called, you know?

38:54.000 --> 38:56.360
And I thought we were getting on
so well together.

39:00.360 --> 39:01.640
Peter, I can explain.

39:01.720 --> 39:04.280
"The subject is looking
for constant confirmation

39:04.360 --> 39:07.480
and is therefore easy to befriend
and get close to."

39:22.000 --> 39:23.040
Fuck.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.160
So what do you want to know?

39:53.240 --> 39:57.400
What is so important that it's worth
deceiving and betraying me for?

39:58.560 --> 40:00.160
Peter, please...

40:00.240 --> 40:02.200
Do you want to know if I killed them?

40:03.960 --> 40:05.800
Do you want to know
if I'm the Grove Park Killer?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.600
Where's my back

41:23.880 --> 41:25.400
Hey, it's all right.

41:26.520 --> 41:27.640
Okay. It's now off.

41:49.320 --> 41:50.400
Get off her!

41:50.480 --> 41:52.040
Stay away from me!

41:53.120 --> 41:55.400
Maddy!
Can we get the medics in?

41:57.920 --> 41:59.640
Okay, slow down, darling.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.840
Breathe.

42:00.920 --> 42:04.360
You're okay. Okay, okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

42:04.440 --> 42:05.560
Breathe.

42:05.640 --> 42:08.480
It's all right. It's okay. You're okay.
You're safe. You're okay.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.680
Get him out of here!

42:13.880 --> 42:15.000
Can we get medics?

42:58.200 --> 42:59.480
We caught him.

43:01.480 --> 43:02.960
It was Cullen.

44:15.040 --> 44:16.080
Rav...

44:17.040 --> 44:19.440
<i>Cullen used to sit, and watch them die.</i>

44:19.520 --> 44:22.320
<i>It's what he did to his victims in 2005.</i>

44:22.400 --> 44:24.200
<i>It's what he was going to do to Maddy.</i>

44:24.280 --> 44:27.920
He'd move a chair closer
so he could get a better look.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.400
<i>Now I haven't checked the crime scenes,</i>

44:29.480 --> 44:33.160
<i>but whoever killed Liz Harper,</i>
<i>Carol Fincher, Benjamin Williams,</i>

44:33.240 --> 44:35.000
<i>they didn't move anything.</i>

44:35.080 --> 44:36.920
<i>They couldn't have been sitting over them.</i>

44:37.000 --> 44:38.160
<i>Like Cullen did in 2005.</i>

44:40.280 --> 44:41.960
<i>These latest victims...</i>

44:43.120 --> 44:45.080
Cullen didn't kill them.
