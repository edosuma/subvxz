00:21.900 --> 00:26.620
You may believe that you have to die

00:27.610 --> 00:29.930
before the Judgment comes.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.480
But I think the fire

00:34.480 --> 00:36.530
is not around the corner.

00:37.140 --> 00:40.750
The fire is not awaiting

00:42.530 --> 00:44.450
XXX

00:44.450 --> 00:47.880
The fire has already come,

00:48.690 --> 00:54.060
as we mortals drink, gamble and 
fornicate our ways through this world.

00:54.060 --> 00:58.000
Death to hell's bells thundering twelve

00:58.000 --> 01:01.940
The clock of damnations has 
already struck midnight

01:03.470 --> 01:06.420
We're cooked,done

01:06.620 --> 01:10.370
Stick a fork in the ass of the human race

01:10.370 --> 01:13.400
and turn us over on Satan's spits

01:13.400 --> 01:18.320
because we are not going to hell

01:19.440 --> 01:23.880
Surely you understand in Las Vegas,Nevada

01:27.730 --> 01:33.800
I say, we are in hell, now.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.080
Why parking in the alley two 
blocks from the crime scene?

01:42.080 --> 01:46.110
You know,sanitation is flushing out the 
sewer line.We don't want to block their trucks.

01:47.220 --> 01:49.550
Oh, What we've got here?

01:50.570 --> 01:51.950
Hey, guy. Hey

01:56.740 --> 01:59.020
We've got a male DB

01:59.020 --> 02:00.660
Call it in. You've got it,Mitch?

02:00.660 --> 02:02.620
I'll tape the scene.

02:27.370 --> 02:29.280
The man was shot execution-style.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.530
22 in the back of the head

02:32.600 --> 02:35.200
Woman was shot as well,bound and gagged.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.670
I guess the next door complained
about the noise,

02:37.670 --> 02:39.160
manager finally called the police.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.240
unis found this

02:42.540 --> 02:44.630
I don't see any luggage.

02:44.630 --> 02:47.200
Wedding rings still on the fingers.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.200
That rules out robbery,but not infidelity.

02:51.030 --> 02:52.890
One gets to watch the other one die?

02:58.730 --> 03:01.690
Maybe someone was trying to 
teach them a lesson.

03:02.110 --> 03:05.820
Did you guys happen to see the 
Fitzgerald's thermometer on your way over?

03:05.820 --> 03:09.430
Oh yeah, 109, hot as hell.

03:09.430 --> 03:12.240
Anything under 110 is manageable.

03:12.800 --> 03:16.050
Above that,crime rate goes way up.

03:17.950 --> 03:19.250
Sounds like it's getting hotter.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.380
well,there's no wallet
or I.D.On this one either.

04:49.090 --> 04:51.380
This looks like a wet spot.

05:01.410 --> 05:02.240
semen.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.870
There's no indication
she was re-dressed.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.660
It doesn't look like sexual assault.

05:07.670 --> 05:10.800
So... middle class couple...

05:11.380 --> 05:14.840
takes a walk on the wild
side,checks into this dump for...

05:15.630 --> 05:18.990
some fine dining and romance.

05:19.590 --> 05:22.940
Somebody breaks in,kills the
man,and tortures the woman.

05:22.950 --> 05:24.040
For what?

05:24.050 --> 05:25.520
Maybe it's a drug thing.

05:25.530 --> 05:30.770
Well,wouldn't be the first time some nice folks
from henderson came east of fremont to score.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.990
Did you find any drug
residue or paraphernalia?

05:34.000 --> 05:34.750
Not yet.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.950
Maybe tox'll find it in them.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.740
We have one too many bibles.

06:01.180 --> 06:02.940
I don't think they helped.

06:02.950 --> 06:05.230
So you didn't hear or
see anything suspicious?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.330
This job--
you kidding me?

06:06.340 --> 06:08.050
That's all I see and all I hear.

06:08.060 --> 06:09.540
Is that the register?

06:09.550 --> 06:11.040
Give it to me,give it to me.

06:11.050 --> 06:12.450
Room 106.

06:12.460 --> 06:15.140
Paid for the week,cash in
advance,signed 'em in myself.

06:15.150 --> 06:16.090
We got a problem.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.230
What's the problem?

06:17.240 --> 06:19.030
Your handwriting sucks.

06:19.040 --> 06:19.880
What the hell does this say?

06:19.890 --> 06:22.440
Oh,uh... oh,that.

06:22.450 --> 06:26.320
That's the name here and
that's,that's a,well,that's an A.

06:26.330 --> 06:28.130
and the license plate...

06:28.140 --> 06:32.240
that's an n and--
oh-- that's a V.

06:32.250 --> 06:33.930
That's nevada.

06:33.940 --> 06:35.470
You think?

06:43.260 --> 06:44.930
Sidle: Green bloat stage.

06:44.940 --> 06:47.520
He's been here at least 18 hours.

06:47.530 --> 06:50.960
Do you ever wonder why ants don't
crawl up the nose,eat the brains?

06:50.970 --> 06:53.220
I would. Protein.

06:53.530 --> 06:56.620
Ants are scavengers; they
tend to stay on the surface.

06:56.630 --> 06:58.650
You think dead skin
tastes better than brains?

06:58.660 --> 07:02.600
Well,they will go for brains late
in decomp,after all the skin is gone.

07:02.610 --> 07:03.920
Do ants have taste buds?

07:03.930 --> 07:05.070
Ronnie...

07:05.080 --> 07:08.440
I'm going to have to limit
you to 20 questions per case.

07:08.450 --> 07:10.710
- Really?
- Nineteen?

07:11.520 --> 07:12.860
Brass: Hey,sara.

07:13.510 --> 07:15.130
Hey... jim.

07:15.140 --> 07:16.990
So... enjoying the sunshine?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.440
Not really.

07:18.450 --> 07:20.300
D.B.Is a derelict.

07:20.310 --> 07:22.180
I'm kind of surprised to
see you investigating this.

07:22.190 --> 07:25.320
Oh,I'm not working this. I'm working the
double homicide over at the rancho center motel.

07:25.330 --> 07:27.930
We're just doing a
neighborhood sweep for suspects.

07:27.940 --> 07:29.270
You're new. I'm jim brass.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.510
- Yeah.Ronnie lake.
- Right.

07:30.520 --> 07:31.560
Ronnie lake.

07:31.570 --> 07:32.650
Like veronica.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.070
You know,the actress?

07:34.080 --> 07:36.180
Sullivan's travels?

07:36.190 --> 07:38.630
I think that's my dad's favorite movie.

07:38.640 --> 07:39.900
Right.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.790
203-charlie,control.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.900
We have a few hookers
who used the motel.

07:43.910 --> 07:44.870
They're willing to talk.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.700
Yeah,203-charlie,I'm on my way.

07:46.710 --> 07:48.600
- Got to run.
- Bye

07:49.250 --> 07:53.010
So I got a hit off of the print on
the motel room's do not disturb sign.

07:53.790 --> 07:56.500
Drug dealer with priors
for assault-- nice.

07:56.510 --> 08:01.770
Yes,well,don't get too excited because I got
another hit off of the telephone-- pedophile--

08:02.000 --> 08:07.020
and I got one off of the dresser-- rapist--
and another one off of the bed frame--

08:07.030 --> 08:09.980
a prostitute,a pimp,and
another prostitute.

08:09.990 --> 08:10.960
Is that it?

08:10.970 --> 08:13.380
For felonies,yes. You
want misdemeanors,too?

08:13.880 --> 08:16.000
So the blood on the shirt
belongs to your victims.

08:16.010 --> 08:18.530
The high velocity spatter on
the front is a mixture of both

08:18.540 --> 08:21.500
and the blood drops on the left sleeve
appear to solely belong to the woman.

08:21.510 --> 08:23.090
Probably cast-off from the beating.

08:23.100 --> 08:27.050
Now,the pattern on the sleeve has
a straight line on the outside,

08:27.060 --> 08:30.430
and then a matching band
of spatter on the inside.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.659
So the killer rolled up his sleeves?

08:32.669 --> 08:34.340
He had a lot of work to do.

08:34.350 --> 08:37.770
Speaking of which--
the wet spot.

08:38.470 --> 08:42.159
The sex stain was a male
- female combo,both unknown,

08:42.169 --> 08:46.280
but the female shared alleles at
all loci with both of the victims.

08:46.890 --> 08:48.960
It's their daughter.

08:51.020 --> 08:53.200
The parents weren't that old.

08:53.210 --> 08:55.760
The girl would be a teenager at most.

08:55.770 --> 09:00.600
So the killer caps mom and dad,rapes
the girl,and takes her with him.

09:00.610 --> 09:04.430
If you've got a missing
kid,I've got a pedophile.

09:05.510 --> 09:07.310
Alistair rhodes.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.270
Busted in august '94
for child molestation.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.530
That's pre-codis,so there's
no dna on file to match.

09:13.540 --> 09:15.440
Alistair rhodes.

09:15.450 --> 09:16.880
I remember this guy.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.030
He was a lounge singer,called
himself three miles of bad.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.330
It was all over the news.

09:21.340 --> 09:25.260
Well,according to the sheet,he
served five years and made parole.

09:25.270 --> 09:27.140
A registered sex offender.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.030
We know where he lives.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.860
You think those are your fingers
itching to pick up the spike?

09:31.870 --> 09:34.490
Your hands injecting your veins?

09:34.500 --> 09:37.930
Satan finds mischief
still in idle hands.

09:37.940 --> 09:39.870
Brass: Alistair rhodes.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.110
Most people around here
just call me reverend.

09:44.120 --> 09:47.260
Hey,why don't you guys
go super-size those?

09:47.660 --> 09:51.860
So,reverend,I hear that
confession is good for the soul.

09:51.870 --> 09:53.930
You have anything to tell me?

09:53.940 --> 09:58.200
The man you're looking
for no longer exists.

09:58.770 --> 10:01.760
If you'll excuse me,I
have some chores to do.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.380
You ever been to the
rancho center motel?

10:08.390 --> 10:10.090
Plenty of times.

10:10.100 --> 10:15.620
With hookers,addicts,drug
dealers,pimps,wife beaters,runaways.

10:16.560 --> 10:17.960
I save people.

10:17.970 --> 10:20.040
You ever save these two?

10:22.730 --> 10:25.030
You know them,don't you?

10:26.550 --> 10:28.170
There's nothing I can tell you.

10:28.180 --> 10:30.330
These people have a
daughter,and she's missing.

10:30.340 --> 10:32.800
And due to the fact that you're
a convicted sex offender that

10:32.810 --> 10:36.480
means that you better come up with a lot
more than these corny priestly homilies

10:36.490 --> 10:37.990
and you better come up with them fast.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.030
I don't answer to you.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.650
I want to talk to my lawyer.

10:41.660 --> 10:44.670
That's a good idea because
you're under arrest.

10:45.110 --> 10:46.890
Yo,rambar,I have some documents to...

10:46.900 --> 10:48.160
piece of junk.

10:48.170 --> 10:49.610
where's rambar?

10:49.820 --> 10:52.210
Where all state employees
go when they fail repeatedly.

10:52.220 --> 10:53.170
Fbi lab?

10:53.180 --> 10:55.950
Sucking down taxpayer dollars
in quantico as we speak.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.700
Me,I like to think I'm
broadening my horizons.

10:58.710 --> 10:59.940
Yeah,along with your pay grade.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.600
Oh,happy coincidence indeed,sir.

11:02.610 --> 11:04.340
What you got here?

11:05.610 --> 11:07.210
Somebody needs to switch to decaf.

11:07.220 --> 11:09.940
In there somewhere is a
nevada plate number and a name.

11:09.950 --> 11:10.850
Can you dig it out?

11:10.860 --> 11:12.500
I could try.

11:13.290 --> 11:17.390
Brown: The plate number is something,something,
something,d,seven,something,something.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.090
Okay,well,it's a fairly new model.

11:19.100 --> 11:23.250
The four letter,nuree thmber configuration
has only been standard a couple years.

11:27.540 --> 11:29.560
Well,uh... it's a start.

11:29.570 --> 11:34.040
Well,can you cross-reference these records
against the characters in the vics' last name.

11:34.050 --> 11:38.980
It's
m,a,blank,blank,blank,I,blank,blank.

11:43.990 --> 11:45.990
now that's a good start.

11:54.810 --> 11:57.190
Brown: Alvin and girlie macalino.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.630
Let's do it.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.730
This makes what,the third
power outage since summer?

12:01.740 --> 12:02.910
Fourth,actually.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.350
If I didn't know any better,I'd say
the city was trying to get rid of us.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.710
That's a hundred
dollar fine right there.

12:14.090 --> 12:15.910
That's not good.

12:16.460 --> 12:17.850
Brown: Las vegas pd.

12:17.860 --> 12:19.470
Is anybody home?

12:35.100 --> 12:37.190
It smells metallic.

13:11.470 --> 13:13.330
Oh,man.

13:13.340 --> 13:15.230
What the hell is that?

13:17.350 --> 13:19.310
That looks like balut.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.090
It's this filipino delicacy.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.410
My grandmother's best
friend is from manila.

13:24.420 --> 13:26.180
Bet it tastes like chicken.

13:26.770 --> 13:30.210
The macalinos must've been in quite a
hurry to leave their dinner out like that.

13:57.310 --> 13:59.650
so much for the daughter.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.990
no visible signs of sexual trauma.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.990
If it's any consolation.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.490
It's not.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.300
Burger giant

14:25.310 --> 14:28.170
They were eating it at the
motel and someone had it here.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.770
Possible connection?

14:31.840 --> 14:35.260
Hey,maybe we can add
robbery to the list.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.660
Wi-fi card but no laptop.

14:46.990 --> 14:48.840
Mom,dad...

14:49.170 --> 14:51.180
and two girls.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.250
They have another daughter?

14:59.280 --> 15:02.270
okay,so it's not just
the ringing in my ears.

15:57.770 --> 16:01.320
One girl gets my little
pony,the other one ends up here.

16:01.330 --> 16:03.760
That doesn't seem fair,does it?

16:29.970 --> 16:31.250
greg?

16:31.260 --> 16:33.010
Do you have any allergies?

16:33.020 --> 16:34.500
No. Why?

16:35.210 --> 16:36.860
Give me a hand.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.390
The macalinos had two
daughters-- amy and elizabeth.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.970
Elizabeth is dead,and amy is missing.

17:11.980 --> 17:15.780
That is tragic,but it has
nothing to do with my client.

17:15.790 --> 17:18.910
Your fingerprints were found at the
motel where the macalinos were murdered.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.540
My client has already explained that.

17:20.550 --> 17:23.650
Back before you were saving souls,

17:23.660 --> 17:26.800
when you were just molesting
children,you had a partner...

17:26.810 --> 17:28.820
attorney: Who died in
prison eight years ago.

17:28.830 --> 17:33.490
We found male dna on the bedsheets
at the rancho center motel.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.270
You got yourself a new
partner,just like old times.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.800
Only,this time,the
parents busted in on you.

17:44.810 --> 17:47.660
That was bad for you,but worse for them.

17:47.670 --> 17:50.680
And now that mom and dad
are never going to come home,

17:50.690 --> 17:55.140
you get yourself a whole new playpen to
party in and a new buddy to party with.

17:55.150 --> 17:58.670
The dna at the motel--
was it my client's?

17:59.730 --> 18:00.350
No.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.760
Then why is he still in custody?

18:04.220 --> 18:06.270
Because he's still lying.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.040
You're not an ordained minister.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.840
You're not a part of
any recognized church.

18:09.850 --> 18:12.380
You got nothing to hide behind.

18:12.390 --> 18:15.170
So avoid the death penalty--
give us your partner,

18:15.180 --> 18:19.940
we get the girl,and
you get...redemption.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.670
Six years ago,I was an
alcoholic and a crackhead.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.580
This man pulled me out of
the gutter and saved my life.

18:27.590 --> 18:29.280
My firm is doing this pro bono.

18:29.290 --> 18:34.020
I guarantee he will not
do another day in jail.

18:34.420 --> 18:36.450
My partner...

18:37.330 --> 18:39.190
is the lord.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.330
Well,I'm sure it's not
his dna on those sheets.

18:44.100 --> 18:49.310
So anyway,when I graduated I got offers
from both the labs in new york and miami.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.010
Know why I picked vegas?

18:51.020 --> 18:53.370
Sidle: I know you have
nine questions left.

18:53.380 --> 18:55.530
Crime rate's growing faster here.

19:07.250 --> 19:08.970
All of his...

19:09.720 --> 19:12.370
valuables in a rubber-band wad.

19:12.750 --> 19:13.770
No I.D.

19:13.780 --> 19:15.560
Check the shirt pocket.

19:15.570 --> 19:17.500
I was getting there.

19:20.980 --> 19:22.320
Driver's license.

19:22.330 --> 19:23.360
Expired.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.660
Edward kaye,born
1-28-51.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.990
New socks.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.910
Happy face sandwich wrapper.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.370
It's got to be handouts from a shelter.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.100
Make some calls.

19:37.110 --> 19:39.570
You get to ask some questions,ronnie.

19:55.090 --> 19:57.850
You know,if I had to
gauge it by his apartment,

19:57.860 --> 20:00.470
I'd say that alistair
rhodes is a regular guy.

20:00.480 --> 20:04.580
Yeah,I'm sure that's what he
wants everybody to think,too.

20:13.470 --> 20:14.670
Hey,nick.

20:17.320 --> 20:20.030
For a guy with his own
flip-down ironing board,

20:20.040 --> 20:22.400
these shirts look pretty wrinkled.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.180
Hey,archie.

21:01.220 --> 21:01.730
Yo.

21:01.740 --> 21:04.520
Whatever you're
doing,that's more important.

21:04.610 --> 21:06.990
Roman numerals one through six.

21:07.020 --> 21:08.400
All right,let me guess.

21:08.430 --> 21:09.400
Star wars bootlegs.

21:09.410 --> 21:10.960
Child pornography.

21:10.980 --> 21:12.630
Start with the latest first.

21:12.650 --> 21:13.660
Yeah.

21:32.510 --> 21:34.220
that's enough. Let it play.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.730
bang you with chains of iron!

21:38.950 --> 21:41.040
Come from her now!

21:42.080 --> 21:44.150
Back,pandemonium!

21:44.390 --> 21:46.740
Back,confusion!

21:46.970 --> 21:48.050
Leave...

21:48.080 --> 21:48.910
this...

21:48.920 --> 21:50.040
stop it!

21:51.380 --> 21:52.250
That's enough!

21:52.260 --> 21:54.350
Hey,stop,stop!Now,spirit!

21:55.630 --> 21:57.100
Why did you stop him?

21:57.140 --> 21:58.140
- He was hurting her!
- No!

21:58.160 --> 21:59.680
This isn't kiddie porn.

21:59.730 --> 22:01.660
It's an exorcism.

22:01.690 --> 22:03.150
This is your fault.

22:03.190 --> 22:05.050
You didn't believe.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.230
You didn't believe.

22:13.110 --> 22:15.510
Come from her now!

22:21.520 --> 22:22.710
Leave...

22:22.720 --> 22:24.310
this...

22:24.320 --> 22:25.560
girl...now!

22:25.580 --> 22:27.880
Stop it! That's enough!

22:29.830 --> 22:31.430
Why did you stop him?

22:31.440 --> 22:32.550
- He was hurting her!
- No!

22:32.590 --> 22:34.160
Amy's not here.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.400
It's your fault.

22:36.430 --> 22:38.010
You didn't believe.

22:38.590 --> 22:39.740
You didn't believe.

22:39.790 --> 22:42.760
I've helped other people
cast out the devil before.

22:42.790 --> 22:44.030
Videos one through five.

22:44.080 --> 22:49.670
I advised the reverend to document his
rituals for situations just like this.

22:49.690 --> 22:53.330
He performed a religious service
with the full consent of the parents

22:53.350 --> 22:55.300
and then he left the motel room.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.900
Look,if you think we're
going to fall for that,

22:56.930 --> 22:59.170
you have a lot more
faith than I thought.

22:59.190 --> 23:02.530
He has no knowledge of the deaths or
of amy macalino's current whereabouts.

23:02.550 --> 23:04.370
Counselor,is this your
idea of cooperation?

23:04.430 --> 23:05.910
L-listen to me.

23:05.940 --> 23:07.500
Listen to me.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.890
The mother came to me...

23:10.310 --> 23:13.240
at her wit's end,heart in her hand,

23:13.260 --> 23:17.570
begging me,begging me to free her child.

23:17.610 --> 23:20.910
She said she'd tried doctors
and pills,but nothing worked,

23:20.980 --> 23:26.110
so I went to the house,I
saw it with my own eyes.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.570
Let...

23:38.030 --> 23:39.000
me...

23:39.030 --> 23:41.160
out of here!

23:46.670 --> 23:48.830
the thing in that house...

23:50.790 --> 23:52.490
it wasn't amy.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.780
It wasn't human.

23:54.830 --> 23:56.760
I had to cast it out.

23:56.830 --> 23:58.390
Did it work?

24:08.720 --> 24:12.460
The exorcism--
did it work?

24:15.110 --> 24:16.670
No.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.940
Amy's father broke the rules:

24:19.960 --> 24:26.070
Never speak to it, never
interrupt,and believe me completely.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.840
Do only as I say.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.010
And he didn't believe.

24:31.680 --> 24:38.710
Mr.Grissom,do you believe
in a separate,living evil?

24:40.960 --> 24:44.110
You're primitive man on the savannah.

24:44.260 --> 24:47.470
You see something move out
of the corner of your eye.

24:47.540 --> 24:49.830
You assume it's a hyena.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.530
You run,you live.

24:52.750 --> 24:57.910
If you assume it's the wind
and you're wrong,you die.

24:58.540 --> 25:01.720
We have the genes of the ones who ran.

25:01.990 --> 25:07.790
We're genetically hardwired to believe
living forces that we cannot see.

25:07.840 --> 25:13.880
The devil's slyest trick is
making us believe he isn't real.

25:14.190 --> 25:18.100
But call his name
loud and long enough...

25:19.720 --> 25:22.050
guess who comes knocking on your door?

25:22.080 --> 25:23.390
Usually guys like you.

25:23.430 --> 25:25.590
Look,enough with the sunday school bull.

25:25.630 --> 25:27.410
This meeting is over,the deal is off.

25:27.430 --> 25:28.690
We've answered your questions.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.280
I told you the truth.

25:32.150 --> 25:34.260
You have to let me leave.

25:34.290 --> 25:35.400
He's right about that.

25:35.420 --> 25:36.870
If you're not charging
him with anything...

25:36.880 --> 25:38.570
we're charging you with assault.

25:38.610 --> 25:39.230
Fine.

25:39.260 --> 25:42.000
We'll make bail. You'll be
out of here in six hours.

25:44.390 --> 25:48.680
Multiple contusions on the
face,subdural hematomas.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.270
This guy was definitely roughed up.

25:50.290 --> 25:51.920
C.O.D.?

25:51.940 --> 25:53.720
Being homeless in las vegas.

25:53.740 --> 25:55.590
Cardiac arrest due to dehydration.

25:55.610 --> 25:56.490
Thanks,doc.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.770
Anytime.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.370
- Hi,ronnie.
- Hi.

25:59.620 --> 26:03.040
I faxed the D.B.'S photo to
various indigent organizations.

26:03.070 --> 26:05.820
Shelter on rancho and main
I.D.'D him as a regular.

26:05.870 --> 26:08.410
Their special this week
was socks and sandwiches.

26:08.460 --> 26:11.150
Rancho and main is less than
a mile from where we found him.

26:11.170 --> 26:16.400
Bum got into a fight-- business as
usual-- and died of exposure,right?

26:17.680 --> 26:19.500
oops,that was a question.

26:19.530 --> 26:21.690
I know,I'm down to four,

26:21.710 --> 26:24.380
but,I mean,that's
it-- case closed,right?

26:24.410 --> 26:26.700
What does that look like to you?

26:29.290 --> 26:31.350
Perimortem abrasions...

26:31.360 --> 26:34.010
parallel,double rails.

26:34.190 --> 26:36.100
It's handcuffs.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.390
Cops must have picked
him up before he died.

26:38.420 --> 26:40.700
Maybe that's not all they did.

26:41.130 --> 26:42.600
Well,that's a guess.

26:42.650 --> 26:46.310
What is the first thing that the
police do when they question a suspect?

26:46.340 --> 26:47.800
Check for I.D.Standard procedure.

26:47.840 --> 26:51.390
Eddie kaye's only identification
was an expired driver's license

26:51.410 --> 26:55.210
found separated from all
of his worldly possessions.

26:56.270 --> 26:57.800
Print it.

26:58.380 --> 27:01.430
Well,you're not seriously going to go
after the cops over something like this?

27:01.470 --> 27:03.430
You know what? That
question I will answer.

27:03.460 --> 27:06.690
We're not here to protect
anyone,ronnie,not even the cops.

27:06.730 --> 27:09.150
We're here to figure out what happened.

27:09.180 --> 27:13.850
If you can't do that,you
should get a different job.

27:26.950 --> 27:28.580
Officer casella?

27:28.650 --> 27:29.460
That's me.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.320
I'm sara sidle,I'm with the crime lab.

27:31.340 --> 27:33.070
- This is my partner ronnie lake.
- Hi.

27:33.100 --> 27:36.440
Can you tell me why your
fingerprints were found on this?

27:37.250 --> 27:38.580
Well,sure,I touched it.

27:38.630 --> 27:40.640
What else did you touch?

27:42.890 --> 27:43.720
I'm sorry,what do you mean?

27:43.740 --> 27:45.340
Did you strike this man?

27:45.360 --> 27:46.630
Okay,are you trying to jam me up?

27:46.660 --> 27:47.720
We're not trying to do anything.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.760
Where'd you get the bruise,casella?

27:49.800 --> 27:51.880
I got it doing my job.

27:52.750 --> 27:56.460
A couple of train wrecks were slugging
it out over this crap sandwich.

27:56.510 --> 28:01.050
I try to save them from themselves,but
no good deed goes unpunished,

28:01.090 --> 28:03.660
so,uh,one of 'em takes a poke at me.

28:07.350 --> 28:09.200
So I cuff him up,I check his I.D.

28:09.230 --> 28:13.020
I'm ready to run him in,but
my partner says to drop it.

28:13.120 --> 28:17.550
He says this is an old bum
trick,right,like take a swing at a cop,

28:17.590 --> 28:19.420
you go to jail where they have A.C.

28:19.460 --> 28:20.760
They have food,they have water.

28:20.790 --> 28:22.510
I can't believe I almost fell for that.

28:22.550 --> 28:23.970
I kind of wish you had.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.670
The man died.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.200
What do you got there,greg?

28:55.300 --> 28:56.920
22 handgun.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.300
Looks like it could
be the murder weapon.

29:00.040 --> 29:00.950
You off the clock?

29:00.990 --> 29:01.910
Yeah.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.130
Good job.

29:03.190 --> 29:04.530
Thanks.

29:04.560 --> 29:05.630
How you doing?

29:05.640 --> 29:08.110
Well,I've had better days.

29:08.210 --> 29:09.650
You missing me yet?

29:09.710 --> 29:11.580
A little more every day.

29:11.770 --> 29:12.870
Grissom's in the attic.

29:12.900 --> 29:14.350
Still.

29:17.870 --> 29:18.720
- hey.
- Hey.

29:18.750 --> 29:20.000
Bee frame.

29:20.030 --> 29:22.790
Inside,I've got the queen,the
workers,the whole colony.

29:22.810 --> 29:24.310
You're looting the
crime scene of its bees?

29:24.360 --> 29:26.140
I cleared it with animal control.

29:26.180 --> 29:27.700
This colony is healthy.

29:27.730 --> 29:30.520
I need it to study
colony collapse disorder.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.820
Bees are dying in record 
numbers everywhere.

29:32.860 --> 29:36.030
You know,I did read that
if every bee on earth died,

29:36.050 --> 29:38.990
the human race would
follow four years later.

29:39.900 --> 29:42.780
There's no hard evidence
to support that,though.

29:43.220 --> 29:46.720
But the world will end...someday.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.680
you don't think that's cheating?

30:04.720 --> 30:06.760
Anybody can get their
hands on that stuff.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.680
My kid can get the clear,the cream.

30:09.720 --> 30:13.590
Dispatch,we have plate number david-paul
william-robert- one-eight-four,

30:13.630 --> 30:15.310
multiple warrants,parking violations.

30:15.340 --> 30:18.390
Maybe we should juice
up all the players.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.980
Level the field,be more
entertaining for me.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.700
You are one sick twist,my
friend,you know that?

30:23.970 --> 30:25.810
Stolen vehicle.

30:25.920 --> 30:26.940
Hold up.

30:26.970 --> 30:30.890
Dispatch,we have plate number
paul-robert-zebra-david- seven-five-zero.

30:30.940 --> 30:33.050
Stolen vehicle,outstanding homicide.

30:33.070 --> 30:34.970
At koval,oflaf s vegas boulevard.

30:34.990 --> 30:36.650
Wanted for murder, code 6.

30:36.680 --> 30:38.130
Back up.

30:39.980 --> 30:41.870
*****

31:12.360 --> 31:14.730
- hands,let me see your hands!
- Out of the car now!

31:15.020 --> 31:16.000
Get your hands up!

31:16.030 --> 31:17.340
Let me see your hands!

31:17.350 --> 31:18.890
Get out of the car.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.410
Hands!

31:22.000 --> 31:24.080
You know who we're looking
for,scumbag-- amy macalino.

31:24.130 --> 31:25.360
Where is she?

31:25.390 --> 31:26.870
I'm amy.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.040
so you're sure you never
saw this guy before?

31:47.060 --> 31:48.230
That guy?

31:48.250 --> 31:49.970
Uh-uh,no.

31:50.270 --> 31:52.760
Okay,but this guy,uh-huh.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.900
Uh-huh,he was definitely
at the rancho center motel.

31:55.930 --> 31:58.890
He was there,um,three nights ago.

31:58.910 --> 32:01.200
Had his little camera
with him and everything.

32:01.220 --> 32:01.930
Camera?

32:01.960 --> 32:03.900
Yeah,like video camera
and all that stuff.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.180
That helps,thanks.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.590
Thanks for your cooperation.

32:06.610 --> 32:09.420
Um...don't I get a reward?

32:09.450 --> 32:11.490
Yeah,you get to leave.

32:19.300 --> 32:20.810
Hi,amy.

32:21.530 --> 32:24.040
I'm catherine willows,I'm
with the crime lab.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.210
You here to probe me?

32:26.400 --> 32:27.760
Swab.

32:31.650 --> 32:35.530
No,no,amy,this,this
is,um,this is in the mouth.

32:43.770 --> 32:47.940
Staff tells me that you've
already gone through the S.A.E.Kit.

32:47.990 --> 32:51.150
They tell you I'm all banged up inside?

32:52.710 --> 32:54.800
Not in those words.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.700
Amy...

33:00.830 --> 33:02.880
the man that took you...

33:02.980 --> 33:05.410
he cannot hurt you again.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.080
We've got him.

33:07.130 --> 33:07.740
Then can I go?

33:07.770 --> 33:09.710
W-w-where's my clothes?

33:09.760 --> 33:14.540
Well,they're evidence for
now,but you'll get them back.

33:17.170 --> 33:20.880
The clothes that you
wore-- were they yours or...

33:21.950 --> 33:24.350
did he make you wear them?

33:27.270 --> 33:30.580
He made me do a lot of things.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.700
Andrew wolflynn.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.880
Bet your friends call you wolf,huh?

33:34.910 --> 33:36.790
So I'm going to call you wolf.

33:36.850 --> 33:38.680
You can call me jim.

33:38.860 --> 33:41.350
You know,it's really exciting
to meet such a hyphenate.

33:41.370 --> 33:42.400
You know what I mean?

33:42.420 --> 33:44.380
I mean,you're a triple threat.

33:44.410 --> 33:48.630
You know,kidnapper-
rapist-auteur.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.920
Do you like making movies?

33:51.090 --> 33:52.710
What are you talking about?

33:52.780 --> 33:53.730
Kiddie porn.

33:53.780 --> 33:54.790
No.

33:55.330 --> 33:57.340
No,n-no,no way,no-not me,man.

33:57.380 --> 33:59.800
No,not just you--you and a partner.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.200
He shoots,you score.

34:06.590 --> 34:08.190
it must be a really good business.

34:08.230 --> 34:09.960
Low budget,high profits.

34:10.010 --> 34:13.130
Unless you get caught.

34:19.290 --> 34:22.560
I've contacted child services.

34:22.699 --> 34:25.580
You'll have to stay there
for at least tonight.

34:27.550 --> 34:29.850
Do you have any relatives?

34:30.260 --> 34:32.350
Not anymore.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.110
I've got a daughter.

34:40.070 --> 34:42.260
She's almost your age.

34:42.310 --> 34:44.760
Maybe we should hang out.

34:48.030 --> 34:51.520
There'll be some counselors
there that you can talk to and...

34:52.710 --> 34:55.190
take as much time as you need and...

34:56.260 --> 34:59.080
whenever you're ready,to go back to school.

34:59.150 --> 35:00.500
Where do you go?

35:00.560 --> 35:02.080
Jefferson.

35:02.470 --> 35:04.290
Jefferson high?

35:04.340 --> 35:05.080
I don't know that one.

35:05.110 --> 35:07.240
Jefferson middle.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.170
Amy,what grade are you in?

35:11.190 --> 35:13.320
Sixth.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.150
I'm 12.

35:19.480 --> 35:22.050
We got your fingerprints,your semen.

35:22.110 --> 35:26.430
I mean,we got you in the dead couple's car
working to bang their kidnapped daughter.

35:26.550 --> 35:27.550
We got...

35:27.590 --> 35:29.030
did I leave anything out?

35:29.070 --> 35:31.300
Oh,yeah,we got your gun.

35:31.450 --> 35:33.030
I don't own a gun.

35:33.100 --> 35:35.410
No,you know,we checked
the serial number.

35:35.450 --> 35:36.600
It belongs to your grandmother.

35:36.630 --> 35:38.210
But you know...

35:38.260 --> 35:41.840
and you know,it must be really
hard to get that gun off ol' granny.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.450
What the hell are you doing?

35:43.500 --> 35:45.440
I'm just checking your shirt size.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.570
I might want to give
you a christmas present.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.280
17 1/2,36.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.950
You know what? I was
leaving something out,wolf.

35:53.240 --> 35:59.420
We got your shirt soaked not in
one but both of the victims' blood.

35:59.460 --> 36:01.780
You see,this is what
we call a slam dunk.

36:01.810 --> 36:03.150
You're going to jail.

36:03.180 --> 36:04.730
You're going to do time.

36:04.780 --> 36:06.640
But why do it alone?

36:07.400 --> 36:09.210
Don't be a patsy.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.230
Just tell us the name of your partner.

36:12.290 --> 36:14.690
Come on,share with a friend.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.250
And you know what? You don't
even have to tell me his name.

36:17.270 --> 36:19.250
All you have to do...

36:19.280 --> 36:20.880
is point.

36:23.110 --> 36:25.700
I've never seen that
guy before in my life.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.260
Come on,you can do better than that.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.970
I want a lawyer.

37:05.650 --> 37:07.010
What are you doing?

37:07.460 --> 37:08.440
Hey.

37:08.610 --> 37:11.270
I'm trying to make some
sense out of the spatter.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.350
Now,we've already determined that the...

37:14.390 --> 37:17.930
the killer rolled up his sleeves
when he murdered the motel victims,

37:17.980 --> 37:21.250
but when I found the
shirt,the cuffs were buttoned,

37:21.270 --> 37:23.460
and I'm not much bigger than this guy.

37:23.760 --> 37:24.880
And look.

37:25.050 --> 37:27.370
This is as far as the sleeves go up.

37:30.050 --> 37:32.080
Would you give me the
shirt off your back?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.370
Sure.

37:35.570 --> 37:37.000
Here you go.

37:42.590 --> 37:43.750
Okay.

37:50.770 --> 37:51.760
Easy.

37:51.820 --> 37:54.870
So wolflynn wasn't
wearing the shirt,was he?

37:54.910 --> 37:56.850
I guess amy was.

37:57.860 --> 37:59.950
A trophy after sex.

38:01.290 --> 38:02.550
Hey.

38:03.010 --> 38:05.180
I have something I'd like you to see.

38:05.270 --> 38:09.090
The macalino family computer
wares covered from the stolen car.

38:09.120 --> 38:13.580
Archie...found the chat logs.

38:14.030 --> 38:16.070
A lot of traffic between
amy and the wolfman.

38:16.110 --> 38:17.680
Keep reading.

38:25.150 --> 38:27.610
It looks like amy's luring the wolfman.

38:27.650 --> 38:30.530
What would you do if you found
this on lindsey's computer?

38:30.590 --> 38:32.920
Ground her for life.

38:32.980 --> 38:35.230
Take the laptop.

38:35.330 --> 38:38.070
Lock her in the attic,maybe?

38:39.570 --> 38:41.790
Well,you push kids,they push back.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.110
Things can get out of hand pretty quick.

38:44.160 --> 38:47.610
The macalinos were pushed
all the way to an exorcism.

38:47.790 --> 38:52.950
Now,alistair rhodes says that he
left the motel when his ritual failed.

38:52.990 --> 38:56.340
The video shows the
father tried to stop it.

38:56.430 --> 38:59.150
He probably untied her. Right?

38:59.160 --> 39:05.500
So amy escapes,she goes and
gets her knight in shining armor.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.490
Yeah,wolf and his .22 caliber.

39:07.540 --> 39:09.710
They return to the motel.

39:10.240 --> 39:13.810
The parents are gone,but
the room's still paid for.

39:13.940 --> 39:17.000
They have sex and burgers.

39:17.070 --> 39:21.810
And amy calls her mom and dad,who
come back because they still love her.

39:21.870 --> 39:25.170
Dad gets killed first...quick,

39:25.210 --> 39:31.420
but mom,the true believer,the one
who wanted to drive out the demons,

39:31.450 --> 39:33.010
she has to suffer.

39:36.480 --> 39:39.990
And amy goes home to get her computer...

39:40.040 --> 39:42.680
and kills her little sister.

39:43.260 --> 39:45.760
I'll call brass. We'll go pick amy up.

40:03.570 --> 40:06.060
amy,there's somebody here to see you.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.100
Could you come with me,please?

40:17.680 --> 40:19.260
Just wait in here.

40:41.170 --> 40:43.000
We need to see amy macalino.

40:43.050 --> 40:44.760
Popular girl tonight.

40:44.810 --> 40:47.530
- She's upstairs with her minister.
- Let's go.

40:47.570 --> 40:48.540
her what?

40:49.690 --> 40:51.310
Control,this is willows.

40:51.350 --> 40:52.650
I'm at C.P.S.

40:52.690 --> 40:53.520
I need backup.

40:53.540 --> 40:55.090
Code three now.

40:55.680 --> 40:58.060
I cast you out!

41:04.330 --> 41:05.790
alistair,turn around.

41:05.810 --> 41:06.870
Turn around.

41:06.900 --> 41:08.180
Now!

41:08.190 --> 41:10.350
Get down on your knees.

41:14.750 --> 41:16.230
I saved her.

41:18.900 --> 41:20.610
I saved her.
