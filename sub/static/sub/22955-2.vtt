00:17.670 --> 00:19.470
Listen, we have
a bit of a situation,

00:19.570 --> 00:21.570
-something we need
to bring you in on.
-Me?

00:22.640 --> 00:23.540
Hi, Howard.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.710
- He looks exactly like me.
- He is you, Howard.

00:27.810 --> 00:30.710
30 years ago, scientists,
they opened up a passage,

00:30.810 --> 00:32.650
the Crossing.
When you go through this door,

00:32.750 --> 00:34.950
you're in another world,
identical to ours.

00:35.050 --> 00:36.890
A kill order came out
from my side

00:36.990 --> 00:38.260
targeting people on your side.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.890
Handle is Baldwin.

00:39.990 --> 00:41.230
She's a contract assassin.

00:41.330 --> 00:43.060
Your wife may be her
next target.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.360
When do you visit?

00:44.460 --> 00:45.430
Every night.

00:45.530 --> 00:48.300
I need to pretend to be you.

00:49.770 --> 00:50.800
Why do they want to hurt Emily?

00:50.900 --> 00:52.470
To send me a message.

00:52.570 --> 00:53.970
By threatening my wife?

00:54.070 --> 00:55.000
Why not yours?

00:55.110 --> 00:56.240
My Emily's dead.

00:57.270 --> 00:59.010
What on Earth have you been
doing over there?

00:59.110 --> 01:01.080
You don't want to know.

01:16.890 --> 01:19.830
* When I stand

01:19.930 --> 01:23.300
* My back to the sea

01:23.400 --> 01:26.040
* A big white cloud...

01:26.140 --> 01:27.670
Something odd's
been happening lately.

01:27.770 --> 01:29.340
I checked your hours;
you've been breathing a lot

01:29.440 --> 01:31.240
of the other side's air,
and I want to know why.

01:31.340 --> 01:32.840
You know that conversation

01:32.940 --> 01:34.980
is a waste
of your time and mine.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.480
Yes, do remind me that your
clearance is higher than mine.

01:37.580 --> 01:39.220
That's always such a turn-on.

01:44.650 --> 01:46.260
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.290
- What?
- Two Bulgarians acting like

01:48.390 --> 01:49.960
they didn't just
come in together.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.260
They're with you.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.660
Midnight Station
called me two hours ago.

01:53.760 --> 01:57.670
There's a rendition order
in your name.

01:57.770 --> 02:00.570
-Jesus, Emily.
-I don't mean to tell you
your job, Howard,

02:00.670 --> 02:02.770
but if you thought I came here
to hold your hand,

02:02.870 --> 02:04.840
you've forgotten what I do.

02:04.940 --> 02:06.280
You have no idea.

02:06.380 --> 02:07.880
Why is there a rendition
in your name?

02:07.980 --> 02:09.210
That's not what this is.

02:09.310 --> 02:11.009
Your guys here
are gonna take me,

02:11.110 --> 02:12.780
make up whatever story
they want,

02:12.880 --> 02:14.250
and you'll never see me again.

02:14.350 --> 02:16.390
Let's be honest
with each other for once.

02:17.390 --> 02:19.360
Tell me why
you've been crossing over,

02:19.460 --> 02:22.660
and I'll call off
the retrieval team.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.460
I can't.

02:26.460 --> 02:29.300
Well, then,
I'm sorry I can't help you.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.540
Thank you for coming.

02:31.640 --> 02:34.540
Please leave quietly
with the nice gentlemen.

02:35.470 --> 02:38.340
* Oh, how I love it

02:38.440 --> 02:42.310
* Yes, how I love it

02:42.410 --> 02:45.880
* Oh, how I love it so

02:47.820 --> 02:50.650
* Oh, how I love it...

02:50.750 --> 02:52.660
So you know...

02:52.760 --> 02:53.990
I'm unarmed.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.360
* Yes, I love it

02:56.460 --> 03:00.460
* Oh, how I love it so

03:05.870 --> 03:08.940
* After all

03:09.040 --> 03:12.780
* Is said and done

03:12.880 --> 03:16.250
* Everything

03:16.350 --> 03:20.250
* Is just like it began

03:20.350 --> 03:22.850
* Days that came

03:22.950 --> 03:25.860
* Years again... *

03:29.690 --> 03:31.700
*

03:59.690 --> 04:01.660
*

04:08.870 --> 04:10.830
*

04:38.130 --> 04:41.030
*

05:07.660 --> 05:09.690
*

05:35.150 --> 05:37.050
Hey, buddy.

05:39.260 --> 05:41.220
That his blood or yours?

05:41.320 --> 05:42.860
Neighbor's. Neighbor's dog.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.490
No problem.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.100
Good boy.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.630
Did you get any sleep?

05:47.730 --> 05:50.100
Long story.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.170
What do you got?

05:54.270 --> 05:55.940
Name.

05:57.740 --> 05:59.080
Name?

05:59.180 --> 06:02.010
Baldwin's real name.

06:02.110 --> 06:03.550
That's it?

06:03.650 --> 06:06.550
I asked him for network, bio,

06:06.650 --> 06:08.690
possible crash pads
on their side.

06:08.790 --> 06:10.920
Tell this kid to stop
fucking around, all right?

06:11.020 --> 06:12.960
When you go back?

06:13.060 --> 06:14.320
Soon.

06:14.420 --> 06:16.760
I need you to keep him
a while longer.

06:16.860 --> 06:18.260
Okay. Yeah.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.030
Pope wants to see you.

06:23.130 --> 06:24.930
Okay.

06:25.030 --> 06:27.170
Keep him away from
the neighbor's dog, huh?

06:32.840 --> 06:34.810
*

07:00.300 --> 07:01.770
Look at her.

07:01.870 --> 07:04.740
You could set a clock
by her bowels.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.710
I find myself envious of a dog.

07:09.350 --> 07:12.020
Doctor say anything new?

07:12.120 --> 07:14.020
Prostate.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.290
Things we know.

07:16.390 --> 07:17.990
You need anything?

07:18.090 --> 07:20.060
Do I need anything?

07:20.160 --> 07:21.560
You're so kind, dear boy.

07:21.660 --> 07:23.090
No, thank you.

07:23.190 --> 07:25.460
No, I'm quite taken care of.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.670
Remember when these places

07:29.770 --> 07:32.240
were used predominantly
for worship?

07:32.340 --> 07:34.000
Now they're reserved

07:34.100 --> 07:36.970
for ghosts, I suppose.

07:37.070 --> 07:41.080
Sad, really,
what's become of our world.

07:41.180 --> 07:43.450
Had an unpleasant encounter

07:43.550 --> 07:46.180
with three Bulgarians
last night when I got in.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.090
Yes, I heard. Kolya's men.

07:49.190 --> 07:51.050
What's my exposure?

07:53.120 --> 07:55.960
If I'm walking
into that building today,

07:56.060 --> 07:58.190
like to know
if someone's gonna lock me up

07:58.290 --> 08:00.000
for killing three contractors.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.300
Here's what you'll do.
Go to the Office...

08:02.400 --> 08:03.800
one of two outcomes.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.700
Either you're taken
for the murder

08:05.800 --> 08:08.170
of three men
on a routine rendition,

08:08.270 --> 08:11.940
or nothing happens.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.750
In which case, there was
no rendition last night.

08:15.850 --> 08:18.010
Someone was trying to kill you,

08:18.110 --> 08:20.150
and they're now
covering their tracks.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.750
Either way,

08:23.850 --> 08:26.860
I suggest you watch your back.

08:28.220 --> 08:30.960
I managed to get you
a 36-hour visa this time.

08:31.060 --> 08:32.960
Don't ask me how.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.080
*

08:57.220 --> 08:59.160
That's it.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.960
44C12.

09:07.030 --> 09:09.000
*

09:27.880 --> 09:30.920
36 hours. Safe travels.

09:44.730 --> 09:46.170
Thank you for joining us, Emily.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.270
It appears
there's been an incident

09:50.370 --> 09:51.940
that we need to discuss.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.640
Why is Personnel
in this meeting?

10:00.380 --> 10:02.750
Three men are dead.

10:02.850 --> 10:04.150
Bulgarian contractors

10:04.250 --> 10:07.160
who were assigned
to your operations team.

10:07.260 --> 10:11.190
Bob, is this a debrief
or an inquisition?

10:11.290 --> 10:13.130
You were there.

10:13.230 --> 10:16.170
I got a rendition call.

10:16.270 --> 10:18.600
2330.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.500
A message, that an agent
had been recalled

10:21.600 --> 10:23.770
and I should bring him in.

10:23.870 --> 10:25.680
Who was the agent?

10:30.180 --> 10:32.450
Why do I feel
this is news to you?

10:35.420 --> 10:38.020
Emily...

10:38.120 --> 10:40.990
there was no rendition order
for any agent last night.

10:42.630 --> 10:45.330
Nothing went
to the Midnight Station.

10:45.430 --> 10:47.860
Our ledger's blank.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.370
So maybe you'd like
to explain to me

10:50.470 --> 10:53.440
why three men from your team
were found dead.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.370
You having a hardship, Emily?

10:55.470 --> 10:57.310
A hardship?

10:57.410 --> 10:59.610
-Is everything all right
in your personal life?
-Can you not see

10:59.710 --> 11:02.810
I'm trying to have
a conversation with him?

11:02.910 --> 11:05.350
We're going to need
blood and urine.

11:05.450 --> 11:08.990
One fuck-up, we can test.

11:09.090 --> 11:10.820
We can't afford
another Istanbul,

11:10.920 --> 11:12.120
and neither can you.

11:12.220 --> 11:14.060
I'm sorry.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.230
None of this makes any sense.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.100
Take a few days.
We'll be in touch.

11:23.430 --> 11:25.100
I'm here if you want to talk.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.370
Fuck off.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.410
*

11:55.000 --> 11:56.570
You took care of his wife?

11:56.670 --> 11:59.840
She's in a different hospital,
unlisted and under guard.

11:59.940 --> 12:01.500
What about him?

12:01.600 --> 12:04.340
Yeah, he'll cooperate.
He's been promoted to Analysis.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.680
I want him with us.

12:06.780 --> 12:08.510
Sorry, you can't just
walk over here

12:08.610 --> 12:11.010
and dictate the terms of
this collaboration, all right?

12:11.110 --> 12:13.220
I have Baldwin's real name.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.020
Which I'm guessing
is more than you have.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.650
So let me make this clear.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.420
Sometimes
I'm gonna ask for stuff.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.630
You want the name?

12:23.730 --> 12:26.430
I want other Howard with us.
That's the deal.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.100
Before this, you were Interface?

12:34.200 --> 12:36.110
- Yes.
- Then you know what these are.

12:36.210 --> 12:37.940
- Yes.
- Take code from conversations,

12:38.040 --> 12:40.080
find word in cipher phrase book.

12:40.180 --> 12:42.150
We translate incoming words,
not outgoing words.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.180
That goes
to outgoing department.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.320
Outg... I'm sorry.
Uh, we, uh...

12:46.420 --> 12:48.520
we-we translate
these conversations

12:48.620 --> 12:50.090
into what, exactly?

12:50.190 --> 12:53.060
Work fast. More folders come
in the afternoon.

13:03.770 --> 13:05.330
Silk.

13:11.410 --> 13:14.580
Our mutual friend
has requested your presence.

13:14.680 --> 13:16.150
Now, let's get
one thing straight.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.250
You're only
part of this arrangement

13:17.350 --> 13:18.550
because of him.

13:18.650 --> 13:21.180
You will not interfere,

13:21.280 --> 13:23.490
and you will share nothing
with him

13:23.590 --> 13:25.960
about the nature of our work.

13:26.060 --> 13:27.720
I don't really know anything

13:27.820 --> 13:29.460
about the nature of our work.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.860
Exactly.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.330
So, what are we doing?

13:38.200 --> 13:40.900
You're gonna find the woman
who tried to kill your wife.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.410
*

14:24.210 --> 14:26.250
*

14:50.510 --> 14:52.540
*

15:03.450 --> 15:07.360
He's upstairs, isolated,
under watch.

15:07.460 --> 15:08.660
Put them together.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.660
No one in, no one out.

15:29.650 --> 15:31.580
Wait here.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.490
Heard you got a promotion.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.720
That's right. Analysis.

15:41.820 --> 15:45.330
So, 30 years
toiling in obscurity,

15:45.430 --> 15:48.130
and now you're suddenly
moving up in the world.

15:48.930 --> 15:50.430
I'm sorry. Wh... Uh...

15:50.530 --> 15:53.900
Why exactly are we
in a concert hall?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.770
There's a violinist
named Nadia Fierro.

15:56.870 --> 15:59.940
Italian-born,
immigrated here in '94.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.840
She's expected here
for a rehearsal.

16:01.940 --> 16:04.780
- You heard of her?
- No.

16:04.880 --> 16:08.480
On my side,
Nadia is not a violinist.

16:08.580 --> 16:12.420
She's an assassin,
goes by the name Baldwin.

16:16.760 --> 16:20.430
She's... the other her.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.570
You got to be kidding me.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.440
Can't believe
we even own the same shirt.

16:30.540 --> 16:33.910
You always wear
that shiny white undershirt?

16:34.010 --> 16:36.750
It's a... it's a Thompson Tee.

16:36.850 --> 16:37.850
Emily bought 'em for me.

16:37.950 --> 16:40.180
You know, the...

16:40.280 --> 16:42.520
They have the... the pit guards

16:42.620 --> 16:44.750
for... sweating.

16:46.390 --> 16:48.360
Anyway, based on the math,

16:48.460 --> 16:51.390
we know these two women
share a past.

16:51.490 --> 16:54.530
Nine, ten years
before the timeline diverged.

16:54.630 --> 16:56.630
Same childhood, traumas,

16:56.730 --> 16:59.640
behavioral whatever.

16:59.740 --> 17:00.970
Right now, Baldwin is hurt.

17:01.070 --> 17:03.170
She's in a city
that's not her own.

17:03.270 --> 17:04.609
She has to act impulsively.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.980
When she acts impulsively,
she acts like herself.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.740
So the more we get on Nadia,
the more we learn

17:08.839 --> 17:10.609
about where Baldwin might go.

17:10.710 --> 17:13.280
Okay, wh-what...

17:13.380 --> 17:16.990
wh-what exactly is it
that you do for a living?

17:17.089 --> 17:20.319
I do a lot of things,
including retrieval.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.829
Come over here, quick trips,

17:22.930 --> 17:25.589
find defectors
and bring 'em home.

17:25.690 --> 17:29.470
I just... I... I don't
understand how we can be...

17:30.930 --> 17:34.440
I mean, is your world really
that different from mine?

17:34.540 --> 17:36.670
This is really not
a conversation you want to have.

17:36.770 --> 17:39.580
Okay, well, like,
30 years ago, when the...

17:39.680 --> 17:43.080
when this door,
portal was discovered...

17:43.180 --> 17:45.880
Not discovered.
That's... imprecise.

17:45.980 --> 17:49.690
"Discovered" implies there were
always these two realities.

17:49.790 --> 17:51.650
There was one reality,

17:51.750 --> 17:54.190
and then... it duplicated.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.860
Nobody knows how.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.700
Well, maybe somebody knows,
but they're not telling.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.700
Look, think of it like this.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.970
Up until 30 years ago,

18:04.070 --> 18:06.700
there was just this.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.410
Then this happened.

18:09.510 --> 18:11.240
Then this.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.740
Now we're like...

18:14.840 --> 18:17.810
Two people,
two completely different paths.

18:33.830 --> 18:35.230
Ja, hallo?

19:02.590 --> 19:04.560
Oh.

20:28.740 --> 20:30.780
She plays beautifully.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.960
Jesus.

21:32.170 --> 21:35.210
They were asking how you are.

21:35.310 --> 21:37.650
I'm fine.

21:52.290 --> 21:54.360
A crosser's come over.

21:56.060 --> 21:58.100
His name's Howard Silk.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.900
He's an operative from home;
been a problem for a while.

22:06.070 --> 22:07.880
And he has your name.

22:23.090 --> 22:25.960
Standard course of action is...

22:31.330 --> 22:33.440
I know what it means.

22:46.350 --> 22:49.990
This is her address.

22:50.090 --> 22:51.950
You need to kill her.

22:53.860 --> 22:56.020
Before they use her
to get to you.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.600
Won't be easy.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.600
- It will be for me.
- Nadia...

23:08.700 --> 23:11.170
Don't call me that.

23:12.410 --> 23:14.110
You share a past with her.

23:14.210 --> 23:15.980
We share nothing.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.450
*

23:31.830 --> 23:33.400
I can do it.

24:54.980 --> 24:56.980
*

25:12.660 --> 25:14.460
Nadia's in the bar next door.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.200
- You have her home address?
- Yes.

25:17.300 --> 25:20.840
All right. You want to go check
it out, take other me with you?

25:20.940 --> 25:22.140
And you... where are you going?

25:22.240 --> 25:24.310
The bar, see what I can
get out of her.

25:24.410 --> 25:25.870
Got a mickey?

25:27.280 --> 25:28.980
Tranquilizer? Ketamine?

25:29.080 --> 25:30.980
Jesus, you fucking guys
are Housekeeping, right?

25:31.080 --> 25:32.280
Give it to him.

25:43.790 --> 25:46.260
Jennifer Wilcox.

25:48.230 --> 25:50.430
Okay.

25:50.530 --> 25:52.600
They're not for you.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.710
Don't let him leave your sight.

26:38.150 --> 26:41.150
Where did you get that?

26:41.250 --> 26:43.150
Confiscated Items.

26:53.400 --> 26:57.400
You know, they didn't even look
at my phone log.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.770
They just didn't want to know.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.970
It's not about you.

27:02.070 --> 27:03.910
It's Howard.

27:04.010 --> 27:06.340
Whatever bullshit he's into.

27:06.440 --> 27:08.180
Let it go.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.450
Anything about that contractor
who slipped across?

27:16.550 --> 27:18.250
- Baldwin.
- Em...

27:18.350 --> 27:20.390
No inquiry into
who she's working for?

27:20.490 --> 27:21.920
How she got her papers?

27:22.020 --> 27:23.630
Whatever the operation is,
someone's

27:23.730 --> 27:26.190
made it clear
they don't want it looked into.

27:26.290 --> 27:29.030
So let's leave it alone.

27:30.230 --> 27:32.940
- Fuck it.
- Fuck it.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.210
*

27:53.560 --> 27:56.390
Excuse me. Hi. Uh,

27:56.490 --> 27:57.530
I need the, uh...

27:57.630 --> 27:59.360
Do you speak English at all?

27:59.460 --> 28:00.700
No? Uh...

28:00.800 --> 28:02.160
Okay, sorry. I need a-a...

28:02.260 --> 28:03.170
I need to make a call.

28:03.270 --> 28:05.330
Do you have a landline
I could, uh...

28:05.430 --> 28:07.200
I'm sorry. I don't...

28:07.300 --> 28:09.240
I don't speak any German.

28:14.380 --> 28:16.240
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.190
Hi, Jen.

28:30.290 --> 28:31.760
Hi, it's your...

28:31.860 --> 28:34.360
Yeah, of course.
You know who it is.

28:34.460 --> 28:36.260
Jenny, please don't hang up.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.430
I, uh...

28:38.530 --> 28:39.900
I'm-I'm here.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.100
I'm-I'm... I'm in Berlin.

28:42.200 --> 28:45.270
And, uh, I'm actually
right across the street.

28:45.370 --> 28:46.570
Please don't hang up.

28:46.670 --> 28:49.180
Jenny, sweetie, I-I came all...

28:58.520 --> 29:01.420
May I have a... Scotch?

29:06.690 --> 29:09.400
Thank you for...

29:09.500 --> 29:12.700
Had my U.S. cell phone
with me here, and...

29:12.800 --> 29:15.370
Useless.

29:15.470 --> 29:16.940
She's your daughter?

29:18.270 --> 29:19.940
Yeah.

29:20.040 --> 29:22.080
She, uh, she plays
in the orchestra

29:22.180 --> 29:24.210
rehearsing across the street.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.220
Jennifer Wilcox.

29:27.320 --> 29:28.480
Do you know her?

29:29.780 --> 29:33.190
No.

29:33.290 --> 29:35.860
I don't know what
I'm doing here. I...

29:35.960 --> 29:38.130
cashed in all my airline miles.

29:38.230 --> 29:40.800
I... thought I'd surprise her.

29:44.630 --> 29:46.030
Sorry, I'm...

29:46.130 --> 29:49.600
Confessions of a stage dad.

29:49.700 --> 29:53.310
Maybe you're familiar
with the type.

29:55.340 --> 29:56.440
Well...

29:56.540 --> 29:58.810
on behalf of all
screwup fathers everywhere,

29:58.910 --> 30:00.550
I apologize humbly.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.360
*

30:31.580 --> 30:33.620
*

30:51.200 --> 30:53.240
*

31:06.410 --> 31:10.290
I think the tipping point
came in her fifth grade year.

31:10.390 --> 31:14.220
I was driving her hard,
preparing for this recital.

31:14.320 --> 31:15.890
It was just elementary school,
you know,

31:15.990 --> 31:18.530
but I was really pushing.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.730
Did she enjoy playing?

31:21.830 --> 31:23.570
I thought so.

31:23.670 --> 31:26.770
I mean, if you have a gift
for something, you...

31:26.870 --> 31:29.000
you enjoy it, right?

31:30.370 --> 31:31.870
Anyway.

31:31.970 --> 31:34.310
You don't have kids, I take it.

31:34.410 --> 31:35.380
No.

31:38.780 --> 31:41.650
My father was not a good man.

31:42.950 --> 31:44.490
Was?

31:44.590 --> 31:46.620
He's dead.

31:46.720 --> 31:47.790
How old were you?

31:47.890 --> 31:49.420
Ten.

31:50.660 --> 31:52.190
Failed artist.

31:52.290 --> 31:55.500
Nothing but drink and anger.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.670
Left me his debt.

31:57.770 --> 31:59.530
House in Kopenick.

31:59.630 --> 32:00.900
A small, shitty existence.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.370
I never sold it.

32:03.470 --> 32:05.510
Maybe someday it will burn down.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.420
It's corticosteroids.
It's nothing.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.550
- Not anti-depressant?
- No, it's for hands.

32:18.650 --> 32:20.220
It's the carpal tunnel.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.320
Nothing.
Just put 'em back.

32:22.420 --> 32:24.460
I'm sorry, what exactly
is our intention here?

32:24.560 --> 32:26.660
How does playing with
this woman's underwear

32:26.760 --> 32:28.230
give us any useful information?

32:28.330 --> 32:29.960
She doesn't know
about any of this.

32:30.070 --> 32:31.730
Just like you, Howard.

32:31.830 --> 32:34.440
I am not him.

32:34.540 --> 32:36.440
You may know him.

32:36.540 --> 32:38.310
You do not know me.

32:38.410 --> 32:40.380
Do you really think
you're that different?

32:40.480 --> 32:44.280
Do you think I can't look at you
and know everything about him?

32:44.380 --> 32:47.350
Look at him and know
everything about you?

32:47.450 --> 32:50.950
You share more than you think.

32:51.050 --> 32:52.550
I see everything.

32:55.860 --> 32:57.460
It's him.

32:58.930 --> 33:00.800
What?

33:00.900 --> 33:03.870
Should be an address somewhere...
I don't know, tax records.

33:03.970 --> 33:05.870
A house in Kopenick,
was her father's.

33:05.970 --> 33:07.770
She says it's empty.

33:07.870 --> 33:10.000
There's a good chance
you'll find Baldwin there.

33:10.110 --> 33:12.540
I'll see what else
I can get here.

33:13.980 --> 33:16.410
Look for tax records.

33:17.980 --> 33:20.580
Finished here, yeah?

33:21.580 --> 33:23.050
No.

33:39.430 --> 33:40.870
It's the house
where she grew up.

33:40.970 --> 33:42.540
How far is it?

33:42.640 --> 33:43.870
20 minutes.

33:43.970 --> 33:46.440
Drive fast.

34:18.510 --> 34:20.409
*

34:50.570 --> 34:52.610
*

35:21.000 --> 35:23.170
*

35:38.120 --> 35:41.260
*

36:13.590 --> 36:15.690
This is where she grew up?

36:15.790 --> 36:17.530
They both grew up here.

36:17.630 --> 36:21.060
This was the past they share.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.330
*

36:48.790 --> 36:50.730
She was just here.

37:09.980 --> 37:12.310
This is Nadia Fierro's address.

37:12.410 --> 37:15.180
We've got to get back
to the concert hall.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.420
*

37:32.830 --> 37:34.870
She was looking for Nadia.

37:34.970 --> 37:37.000
She may be coming to you.

37:41.980 --> 37:43.950
*

38:14.440 --> 38:17.680
I have
a small confession to make.

38:17.780 --> 38:19.550
I was...

38:19.650 --> 38:22.880
I was in the concert hall
earlier,

38:22.980 --> 38:24.590
looking for Jen,

38:24.690 --> 38:27.790
and, uh... I saw you play.

38:27.890 --> 38:30.630
Beautifully. Why...

38:30.730 --> 38:32.790
why do you take off your shoes?

38:37.430 --> 38:41.200
Well, after my father died,
I, um,

38:41.300 --> 38:45.140
I did not have... things.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.610
But you stayed with the violin.

38:48.710 --> 38:50.810
Even after he was gone.

38:50.910 --> 38:53.350
I was good at it.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.990
Do you ever wonder...

38:58.090 --> 39:00.920
what you'd be if you weren't?

39:02.920 --> 39:04.990
*

39:05.090 --> 39:08.000
I mean, you could be anything.
You were free.

39:14.070 --> 39:15.700
I was lost.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.340
I went from foster home
to foster home.

39:18.440 --> 39:21.310
And I tried on lives
like dresses.

39:21.410 --> 39:23.240
Every year there was a new home.

39:23.340 --> 39:26.910
New family.

39:27.010 --> 39:28.380
New Christmas present

39:28.480 --> 39:31.320
addressed to a new name.

39:31.420 --> 39:34.190
You become
who they want you to be.

39:34.290 --> 39:36.390
And you lose yourself.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.600
You still had the violin.

39:50.170 --> 39:51.440
Well...

39:51.540 --> 39:54.540
we cannot escape who we are.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.680
Papa?

40:45.930 --> 40:47.900
*

41:12.050 --> 41:14.190
Nadia! Nadia!

42:42.080 --> 42:43.340
Nadia!

43:49.480 --> 43:51.210
Stay in the car.

43:51.310 --> 43:53.110
Leave this to us.

43:55.620 --> 43:56.780
Where's Silk?

43:56.880 --> 43:58.690
He got out before I did.

43:58.790 --> 44:00.090
Find her before the police do.

44:17.040 --> 44:18.540
She's in here somewhere.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.070
We don't have much time.

44:22.880 --> 44:26.010
Hey. Hey. I'm not gonna be
much help without a gun.

44:27.920 --> 44:30.020
Give him your sidearm.

45:19.600 --> 45:22.670
She comes out
that door, take the shot.

45:22.770 --> 45:24.910
- I need her alive.
- Your side's problems

45:25.010 --> 45:26.770
are not our side's problems.

45:26.870 --> 45:28.980
Time you understood.

45:47.490 --> 45:49.500
*

47:40.770 --> 47:43.210
- What do we do?
- The police are here.

47:43.310 --> 47:46.850
- Be fast.
- I don't have clear ID.

47:46.950 --> 47:49.220
- Permission to fire.
- Take the shot.

47:49.320 --> 47:50.480
No, no, stop!

47:58.090 --> 47:59.290
Disappear.

48:08.370 --> 48:10.400
*

48:41.770 --> 48:44.210
Howard, got to go.

48:44.310 --> 48:45.710
Now!

48:53.250 --> 48:55.220
*

49:38.030 --> 49:39.860
- She gonna make it?
- The police have her.

49:39.960 --> 49:42.130
The other one is dead.

49:58.050 --> 50:00.150
She was innocent.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.190
Get in the car.

50:06.290 --> 50:08.020
We'll put you up somewhere.

50:08.120 --> 50:09.860
I'm sleeping here tonight.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.330
No, you're not.

50:11.430 --> 50:13.830
Let me ask you something,
you sloppy fuck: Do you have

50:13.930 --> 50:16.030
the slightest clue how much
you've escalated this thing?

50:16.130 --> 50:18.200
You let a crosser
get into police custody.

50:18.300 --> 50:19.900
We've dealt with worse.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.400
Well, that's not
surprising, I guess,

50:21.500 --> 50:23.100
given this fucking amateur hour.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.940
- Get in the car.
- No. Fuck you.

50:25.040 --> 50:26.810
I don't answer to you.

50:30.540 --> 50:33.050
Just because Quayle
is willing to play this game

50:33.150 --> 50:35.250
doesn't mean that I will.

50:38.020 --> 50:40.350
I know what you are.

50:40.450 --> 50:42.590
Understand?

50:50.800 --> 50:52.230
Keep men outside this door.

50:52.330 --> 50:55.600
Again, terrific work
tonight, fellas.

50:55.700 --> 50:57.600
Really fucking clean.

51:08.220 --> 51:10.920
That's not a bedroom.

51:11.020 --> 51:13.520
I'll make up the couch for you.

51:25.500 --> 51:27.600
Things got out of hand tonight.

51:32.310 --> 51:35.540
There's too much that
I can't control over here.

51:35.640 --> 51:37.640
Aldrich, obviously,
for one thing,

51:37.740 --> 51:39.350
is a fucking liability.

51:41.080 --> 51:42.980
If I'm gonna do this right,

51:43.080 --> 51:45.350
I need your help.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.260
My help?

51:49.260 --> 51:51.020
Yeah. I'll talk to Quayle.

51:51.120 --> 51:53.190
Get you transferred to Strategy,

51:53.290 --> 51:55.400
where you can be useful.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.930
You want me to spy for you.

52:00.030 --> 52:02.200
Yeah.

52:04.710 --> 52:07.440
Why am I a part of this?

52:07.540 --> 52:10.510
You demanded
that I be there today.

52:10.610 --> 52:12.910
I-I don't understand why
I'm involved in any of this.

52:13.010 --> 52:15.020
I don't know, Howard.
Maybe I'm trying to help you.

52:15.120 --> 52:18.050
And why is my perceived
well-being so important to you?

52:18.150 --> 52:20.050
A few days ago,
you were nothing.

52:20.150 --> 52:22.260
A flatliner, sleepwalking.

52:24.630 --> 52:26.630
Look at you now.

52:29.500 --> 52:32.770
Do me a favor, stop trying
to make me in your image.

52:34.840 --> 52:36.500
Where you going?

52:36.600 --> 52:38.710
I'm going where I've gone
every evening

52:38.810 --> 52:41.280
for the last six weeks.

52:41.380 --> 52:43.640
To the hospital to see my wife.

53:14.510 --> 53:18.310
How long have you known
your ex-husband's signal plan?

53:29.460 --> 53:32.530
Perhaps we should find
a signal plan of our own.

53:32.630 --> 53:35.060
I've always thought
we should speak more often.

53:40.330 --> 53:42.540
Is Howard working for you
right now?

53:42.640 --> 53:44.710
'Cause he almost
got himself killed.

53:46.610 --> 53:48.940
Not ordinarily my concern,

53:49.040 --> 53:51.450
but whoever ordered it
is trying to pin it on me,

53:51.550 --> 53:54.150
so they're trying
to ruffle me, too.

53:54.250 --> 53:56.320
I need to know what he's into.

53:59.650 --> 54:03.320
May I offer you some advice?

54:05.290 --> 54:07.390
Best leave this alone.

54:10.230 --> 54:12.200
I know about the contractor.

54:12.300 --> 54:15.400
The one who went over
to the other side.

54:15.500 --> 54:17.640
I know that she's been
conducting illegal operations,

54:17.740 --> 54:20.410
and I know that
no one's talking about it.

54:20.510 --> 54:23.280
I've heard rumors myself.

54:23.380 --> 54:25.150
About a Housekeeping agent

54:25.250 --> 54:27.810
under suspicion
of substance abuse.

54:30.620 --> 54:34.320
How is everything
in your personal life, Emily?

54:41.930 --> 54:44.160
Why do you care so much

54:44.260 --> 54:47.770
about some poor bastards
on the other side?

54:47.870 --> 54:51.140
Because it's my job.

54:51.240 --> 54:53.710
Keeping the peace.

54:53.810 --> 54:56.110
Peace?

54:56.210 --> 54:58.410
I wonder when
we've ever had peace.

55:01.750 --> 55:04.550
I wonder if there will
ever come a reckoning...

55:06.690 --> 55:08.860
...for what they did to us.

55:11.560 --> 55:13.830
Times are changing.

55:13.930 --> 55:17.900
Scary to think how fragile
this peace really is.

55:20.500 --> 55:23.170
And how about you, Pope?

55:23.270 --> 55:24.940
How have you been feeling?

55:25.040 --> 55:27.310
Oh, much better these days,

55:27.410 --> 55:28.940
thank you.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.780
Isn't that a shame.
