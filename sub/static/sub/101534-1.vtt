reported by many

where your life flashes
before your eyes.

inside here.

from your brain waves

28:12.441 --> 28:13.984
Hey. Hey, hey.

28:14.068 --> 28:16.362
Relax. You’re back.

28:21.742 --> 28:24.286
A wedding?

28:24.370 --> 28:27.039
What else did you see?

28:27.123 --> 28:28.457
(stammering)

28:28.541 --> 28:30.042
We-we were in an old church.

28:30.126 --> 28:32.753
The-There was a large crowd,
about 50, 70 people.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.713
But all their faces
were blurred.

28:34.797 --> 28:36.674
Blurred?

28:36.757 --> 28:40.052
Yeah. I got out of there as
soon as that thing came at me.

28:41.846 --> 28:44.390
The same thing that you saw
during hypnosis?

28:46.392 --> 28:48.269
-What did it look like?
-I-I don’t know,

28:48.352 --> 28:50.813
but it-it... I guess
it looked like a person,

28:50.896 --> 28:52.690
but it-it didn’t move like one.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.692
I see.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.527
I think most likely
that’s your brain

28:56.610 --> 28:58.487
trying to protect you
from your trauma.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.698
It’s trying to keep you
from remembering.

29:00.781 --> 29:05.453
You just have to remember
that that thing is not real.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.957
Next time, we’ll stay
a little longer.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.043
At least one face should appear.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.879
Longer?

29:14.962 --> 29:17.298
That’s why you’ve been sick
for so long.

29:17.381 --> 29:20.634
If you can avoid it,
I think we could overcome this.

29:20.718 --> 29:23.387
Listen, I know
this sounds very strange,

29:23.471 --> 29:26.140
especially after having seen
so many other doctors,

29:26.223 --> 29:28.767
but I mean it--
you are doing well.

29:28.851 --> 29:33.981
The level of detail that you saw
in your first session...

29:34.064 --> 29:36.066
that is remarkable.

29:38.068 --> 29:41.572
Now, I’m committed
to reversing your condition.

29:41.655 --> 29:44.116
I think we can
if we keep pushing.

29:45.576 --> 29:48.287
But I can’t do this
if you don’t trust me.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.208
Okay?

29:56.545 --> 29:58.005
Okay.

29:58.088 --> 29:59.507

Hey.

-Hey. How you doing, bro?
-Come on in.

30:05.763 --> 30:07.306

How are you? -You good?

30:07.389 --> 30:09.016
Yeah, I’m fine, I’m fine.
You all right?

at me, though.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.104
-Ah.
-Is that for us?

30:14.188 --> 30:16.148
-Oh, yeah. I got you, bro.
-Thank you so much.

30:16.232 --> 30:18.234
Ava, got a surprise for you.

Hey. Chinese.

30:25.741 --> 30:28.244
So, uh, how’s it going so far?

30:28.327 --> 30:29.912
-How’s the study?
-Uh, it’s okay.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.455
-Yeah?
-It’s okay. Yeah.

30:31.539 --> 30:35.876
I’m still getting used to
all this, but, um...

30:37.586 --> 30:40.965

You... That’s amazing. Nol.

-That-that’s progress
right there. -Yeah.

30:47.930 --> 30:50.849
You know, uh,
I remember that day, man.

30:50.933 --> 30:52.518
You know, you two
are the only reason

30:52.601 --> 30:54.895
I even considered settling down.

30:56.438 --> 30:59.775
-Were we always that happy?
-Yeah.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.944
You were inseparable.
It was gross.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.614
You and Rachel,
you’d always talk about

31:05.698 --> 31:07.825
this 40-year plan.

31:07.908 --> 31:11.787
Y’all had it mapped out
before you even got engaged.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.664
-Hi, Uncle Gary.
-GARY (chuckles): Hey.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.624
And this munchkin
was the first thing

31:15.708 --> 31:17.334
y’all checked off the list.

31:19.003 --> 31:20.462
-Yeah. You still remember it?
-Yeah.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.131
Yeah, and I’m gonna get
my first car

31:22.214 --> 31:24.216

-And a half.

straight-up weak. (laughs)

this is funny, Gary.

42:23.166 --> 42:24.292

42:24.376 --> 42:26.586
-In your memory?
-Yeah. Yes.

42:26.670 --> 42:30.298
