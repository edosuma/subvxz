02:16.903 --> 02:18.537
Sandy speaking.

02:21.107 --> 02:24.143
How you doing?
I'll take that. Sorry...

02:24.145 --> 02:25.410
Yeah.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.780
Yeah, well check it.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.249
Thank you very much.

02:30.251 --> 02:33.418
And then I'll be with you...
Hmm?

02:33.420 --> 02:36.622
Well, Friday, as far as I knew.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.191
Was Friday not in my diary?

04:29.769 --> 04:32.904
[Woman on radio
<i> welcome to night vision.</i>
<i> I'm Lucy Walsh.</i>

04:32.906 --> 04:34.773
<i> On this week's show</i>
<i> we'll be reviewing</i>

04:34.775 --> 04:37.309
Monica Malone's latest
collection of poetry.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.545
Offering their expert
opinions, as usual,

04:40.547 --> 04:43.115
are noted local
playwright, tom breslin.

04:43.117 --> 04:48.420
And novelist Sandy Duffy,
author of the award winning
<i> a patch of fog.</i>

04:48.422 --> 04:52.424
<i> This is a building</i>
<i>of enormous cultural importance</i>
<i> to this city,</i>

04:52.426 --> 04:54.826
<i> and you're saying that</i>
<i> we should just tear it down?</i>

04:54.828 --> 04:57.663
<i> No, I think my exact words are</i>
<i> we should burn it down.</i>

04:57.665 --> 05:00.599
<i> Oh, come on now, Sandy,</i>
<i> aren't you just being</i>
<i>provocative for the sake of it?</i>

05:00.601 --> 05:02.167
<i> Maybe when he's finished</i>
<i> playing to the gallery</i>

05:02.169 --> 05:04.870
<i> we can have an intelligent</i>
<i> conversation.</i>

05:12.945 --> 05:14.746
There's a memorial to
Lewis at poet's corner.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.515
Maybe we should turn
that into a car park?

05:16.517 --> 05:19.151
Well, exactly, he already has
a memorial at poet's corner.

05:19.153 --> 05:22.287
- What more does he need?
- Well, I think that
will generate enough heat

05:22.289 --> 05:24.122
on our message board.

05:24.124 --> 05:27.192
That's all the fiery debate
we have time for this evening,

05:27.194 --> 05:29.594
but before we go,
I'm happy to announce we will be

05:29.596 --> 05:33.999
celebrating the 25th
anniversary of <i> a patch of fog</i>
with a one off TV special

05:34.001 --> 05:38.403
and live interview
with Sandy Duffy
at the end of this season.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.849
Lucy, are you alone?

05:50.851 --> 05:53.285
<i> Sorry, I got called away.</i>

05:53.287 --> 05:56.555
<i> Someone upstairs thought</i>
<i> you might wanna go</i>
<i> a bit easier on tom.</i>

05:56.557 --> 05:59.991
Oh, come on.
It's just a couple of old dogs
barking at each other.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.861
<i> Well, look,</i>
<i> they gave me the yellow card</i>
<i> to show you, so.</i>

06:02.863 --> 06:05.030
You're a very
good company, girl.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.998
Am I gonna see you tonight?

06:07.000 --> 06:11.470
<i> I can't. Phoebe has</i>
<i> an early start tomorrow.</i>

06:11.472 --> 06:13.905
When do I get to meet her?

06:13.907 --> 06:16.141
<i> Soon.</i>

06:16.143 --> 06:19.378
Great, can't wait.

06:19.380 --> 06:22.314
-<i> See you tomorrow.</i>
- Yep, night.

06:22.316 --> 06:25.884
- Talk to you soon.
-<i> Goodnight.</i>

06:43.936 --> 06:47.239
That picture's from
when you didn't look like a bag
of shite rolled down a hill.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.943
Since when do I pay you
to tell me the truth?

06:51.945 --> 06:54.846
It's a freebie.
Something for you.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.882
Those just came this morning.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.917
Publisher's already
looking at a second run.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.354
Fathers who already have it
are buying it for their sons.

07:02.356 --> 07:04.356
You just wait until
after the special.

07:04.358 --> 07:06.458
<i> The culture show,</i>
all of the big boys,

07:06.460 --> 07:08.727
they'll be wanting
a piece of you.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.796
It's always been a solid
seller in the states.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.231
Wee promotion tour.
New York.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.534
Look, Freddie,
i appreciate all the,

07:15.536 --> 07:19.471
well, your effort,
but do we have to do all this?

07:19.473 --> 07:21.106
I'm tired.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.708
I'm sick of always
talking about it.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.544
Of always being
talked to about it.

07:25.546 --> 07:30.048
Listen...
My advice to you as a friend;

07:30.050 --> 07:31.650
it doesn't make financial sense.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.951
Yeah, and your advice
is in no way

07:32.953 --> 07:35.387
motivated by your commission?

07:36.756 --> 07:40.158
I don't need the money
and I don't need the hassle.

07:40.160 --> 07:44.262
After the interview
we're changing the record.

07:44.264 --> 07:49.401
This wouldn't be anything
to do with a presenter of the
female persuasion, would it?

07:49.403 --> 07:52.504
It's my book, my decision.

07:54.106 --> 07:58.410
So what are we going
to drink to then?

07:58.412 --> 08:01.446
- Obscurity?
- Has a ring to it.

08:01.448 --> 08:02.814
Hollow.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.485
<i> The telegraph</i> called.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.520
Dougie hasn't shown up
for his interview.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.655
Oh, for fuck's sake.

08:10.657 --> 08:14.926
Listen, don't decide just yet.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.762
Take a little bit of time.

08:17.764 --> 08:20.098
Think about it. Ok?

08:58.204 --> 09:00.505
<i> Supersavers, this Christmas,</i>

09:00.507 --> 09:03.008
<i> all our Christmas trees</i>
<i> on special offer...</i>

09:07.146 --> 09:09.681
Yep? I'm just in the shop.

09:09.683 --> 09:14.085
I'm going to pay for stuff
and then I'm going to be
with you, very shortly.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.755
Yeah, yeah. I'm on my way now.

09:16.757 --> 09:20.859
Be there shortly. Ok. Bye.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.861
Excuse me, sir?

09:22.863 --> 09:24.563
Do you mind if I have a
quick word with you please?

09:24.565 --> 09:27.732
- Who me? I'm alright.
- Inside, if you don't mind.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.201
- Is this absolutely necessary?
- Yeah, it really is.

09:30.203 --> 09:33.438
Just stepping off the floor
for ten minutes, Sheila.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.574
Straight through here.

09:37.710 --> 09:41.346
Yeah, well, see what
happened was I, I obviously got
distracted by my phone.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.349
- It was just an accident.
- An accident?

09:46.552 --> 09:50.455
- That's what they all say.
- I.D.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.357
Look, you don't
have to do this.

09:52.359 --> 09:56.227
I mean, surely you've
some degree of autonomy.

09:56.229 --> 10:00.732
Well, can't you let me
off with just a warning?

10:00.734 --> 10:05.804
Shoplifters will be prosecuted.
Signs all over the shop, sir.

10:05.806 --> 10:09.441
- You sure you didn't read them?
- Why would I read them?
I'm not a thief.

10:12.712 --> 10:16.548
- Alexander Duffy.
- So what happens now?

10:16.550 --> 10:19.784
Well, I'm obliged
to call the police.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.053
Then I'll take you down stairs,
we'll stand on the street,

10:22.055 --> 10:23.455
I'll put my hand
on your shoulder

10:23.457 --> 10:25.290
and we'll wait for
the police to arrive.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.326
Could take anywhere
between 20 to 25 minutes.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.261
Especially this time of year
with it being Christmas,

10:30.263 --> 10:32.430
the traffic's terrible.

10:32.432 --> 10:35.300
The longer we wait,
the more people will see you.

10:35.302 --> 10:39.771
The more people that see you,
the bigger the deterrent.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.240
That's the theory anyway.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.509
Look what's your name?

10:46.412 --> 10:49.514
- It's Robert.
- Robert, please don't do this.

10:49.516 --> 10:55.487
Nothing I can do, sir.
You see, you've been captured
on our cctv system,

10:55.489 --> 11:01.026
which then is all recorded
onto this disc.

11:01.028 --> 11:04.763
Even if I wanted to help you,
i couldn't really.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.598
It's out of my hands, sir.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.700
Well, isn't there
anything can be done?

11:08.702 --> 11:10.468
What if I pay for the pen now?

11:10.470 --> 11:13.371
And then if there's any left
over, you get yourself a pint.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.640
Did I say pint?
I meant two pints.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.242
I don't drink.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.514
Please, Robert.

11:22.516 --> 11:26.051
I mean, this...
This could ruin me.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.485
I appear on television.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.120
Well, I don't want to
end up on the news.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.488
Also, I teach at the university,

11:30.490 --> 11:31.623
they have an ethics clause.

11:31.625 --> 11:32.991
I could get the sack.

11:32.993 --> 11:37.328
Hello, bill?
Yeah, it's Robbie.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.732
Robert, what happened to one guy
doing another guy a favor, eh?

11:40.734 --> 11:43.468
It's Christmas.
Come on, man.

11:43.470 --> 11:47.172
Yeah. Hmm.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.707
Please.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.041
Yeah, I was just
checking the system.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.543
Yeah, just making
sure, you know.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.511
Sorry about that.
Ok, you take care.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.014
Happy Christmas.
Love to the wife. Bye-bye.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.483
Oh, listen, Robert.
Cheers, really.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.086
- Thanks so much.
- No, put your money away.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.054
- Really?
- Aye.

12:03.056 --> 12:08.093
What happened to one guy
doing another guy a favor?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.261
Right.

12:11.163 --> 12:13.098
Thanks.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.401
So I'm... I'm free to go?

12:17.903 --> 12:21.172
I tell you what,
if you want to repay me

12:21.174 --> 12:25.777
you could... you could
buy me a Coca-Cola sometime.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.912
Absolutely, Robert.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.547
Any time,
it would be a pleasure.

12:29.549 --> 12:33.518
Brilliant!
I get off in half an hour.

12:39.525 --> 12:42.427
Nothing like a drink after work.

12:49.735 --> 12:51.970
- So, you're on the telly?
- Mm-hmm.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.606
- What program?
- It's called <i> night vision?</i>

12:54.608 --> 13:00.879
- Never seen it.
- We review plays,
films, books, poetry.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.048
I'll have to watch that.

13:06.252 --> 13:09.120
So, what about you, have you
always been in security?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.523
Yeah. Yeah, always.

13:15.995 --> 13:17.595
Well, that must be exciting,
you know.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.431
Keeping up with the thieves.
Learning the new tricks.

13:20.433 --> 13:24.302
Yeah, it has its moments.
There's plenty of tricks though.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.004
There's the toothpick.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.173
Where they wedge
a toothpick in the pocket,

13:28.175 --> 13:29.908
so the pocket stays open.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.643
And then they just knock
all the stuff in their pocket

13:31.645 --> 13:33.411
- off the shelves, you see.
- Right.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.146
Now, my personal favorite,
which is a great one,

13:35.148 --> 13:37.081
- that's called the bicycle.
- Mm-hm.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.684
That's where the thief will
ride up on his bike

13:39.686 --> 13:42.353
outside of my store
and he'll ask me
to look after his bike.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.455
And because I'm such a nice
fella I say, "yeah, no problem."

13:44.457 --> 13:46.925
- Right.
- So I'm looking after his
bike and he's gone inside.

13:46.927 --> 13:50.295
Then his accomplice comes along
and jumps on the bike
and rides away, see.

13:50.297 --> 13:53.798
And while I'm chasing him,
what's the other fella
doing in me shop?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.366
I suppose he's
filling his pockets.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.336
Yeah. Yeah.
See, you'd be good at this, you.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.739
Then there's the telephone.

14:03.709 --> 14:06.778
And that's the one where the
thief pre-sets his phone to go

14:06.780 --> 14:08.313
while he's inside the shop,
you see.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.882
And then he walks out
with the goods.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.350
Can I get you another one, sand?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.818
You know, Robert,
I'd like nothing more,

14:13.820 --> 14:15.987
but I really have to go.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.922
Jesus Christ.

14:20.292 --> 14:23.127
- Alright, Sandy?
- Yeah, listen, Robert.

14:23.129 --> 14:24.629
I really appreciate
all your help.

14:24.631 --> 14:25.864
Thanks again.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.532
That's alright, pleasure.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.033
I'm sure everything'll be fine.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.904
What do you mean
everything'll be fine?

14:32.906 --> 14:36.074
Well, we've got a
little bit of a problem.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.176
See, the disc.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.011
They all get collected,
you see, at the end of the week,

14:40.013 --> 14:42.981
and me boss reviews them all.
Just to keep me on me toes.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.549
Yeah, my name's on that disc.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.551
I know. It'll be ok.
Don't worry. I'll fix it.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.720
I'll get it,
and we'll just meet here,
same time, same place.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.588
Well, can you not just erase it
and throw it away, Robert?

14:50.590 --> 14:53.658
Can you not just
meet me on Sunday?

14:53.660 --> 14:56.594
- Yeah, alright.
- Alright.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.797
You get home safe.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.802
Nice to meet you, Sandy.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.994
Thank you.

15:53.218 --> 15:55.186
There you go, Maggie.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.388
Din-dins.

15:59.591 --> 16:01.326
There you go.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.731
Yeah. That's it.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.818
Bullshit!

16:26.820 --> 16:31.422
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry, Sarah.
I was miles away.

16:33.259 --> 16:36.361
- Sorry about that.
- Ok.

16:40.632 --> 16:43.468
- Shall we continue?
- Mm-hmm.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.103
What did you study
at university?

16:45.105 --> 16:48.039
English literature
and creative writing.

16:48.041 --> 16:51.209
Then along came <i> fog.</i>

16:51.211 --> 16:55.646
It's hard to believe
you were only 25 at the time.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.383
Where did the idea come from?

17:00.486 --> 17:01.853
My family.

17:03.655 --> 17:06.723
My father was agoraphobic.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.795
One day there was
a terrible fog.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.531
I went out into it.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.233
I got lost in it.

17:17.336 --> 17:19.904
I was six years old.

17:19.906 --> 17:23.741
<i> How come you never</i>
<i> told me your father</i>
<i> suffered from agoraphobia?</i>

17:23.742 --> 17:26.344
<i> I thought I did.</i>
<i> It's no big deal.</i>

17:26.346 --> 17:28.512
<i> It is when you're young.</i>

17:28.515 --> 17:31.582
<i> Did he live to see</i>
<i> your book published?</i>

17:32.551 --> 17:34.218
<i> No.</i>

17:35.854 --> 17:37.822
Did you love him?

17:39.091 --> 17:42.860
I'm sorry,
are we on or off the record now?

17:42.862 --> 17:45.897
Why? Is it a difficult question?

17:47.934 --> 17:51.936
He was a difficult man
to get to know.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.205
Good evening, miss.

17:54.207 --> 17:57.742
That's a lovely dress you have
on if you don't mind my saying.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.577
What, this old thing?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.779
You think?

18:01.781 --> 18:04.549
Listen, there's
a new movie playing in town

18:04.551 --> 18:06.451
and I was wondering if...

18:06.453 --> 18:10.688
Now, does he really
wanna go and see a movie?

18:11.590 --> 18:13.724
Subtext.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.761
The actual meaning
hidden below the words.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.796
So when will the show air?

18:18.798 --> 18:22.867
It's a TV special, at the end
of the series, next month.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.735
And will they come here to film?

18:24.737 --> 18:29.273
You know, observe the creature
in his natural habitat?

18:30.576 --> 18:32.410
Have you had a chance
to start my book yet?

18:32.412 --> 18:35.246
Ah. Look, I was gonna start it
the other night but I got

18:35.248 --> 18:39.750
trapped by this, well,
a fan I suppose you'd call him.

18:39.752 --> 18:43.621
Sad little man. It was hours
before I could get away.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.556
But I'll start tonight,
i promise.

18:49.995 --> 18:53.131
Robert.
What are you doing here?

18:55.968 --> 18:59.770
I got off early, so thought
I'd come and say hello.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.240
Troy Griffin, Robert green.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.509
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you, Troy.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.311
- Are you a lecturer as well?
- Oh, I...

19:07.313 --> 19:10.081
- Doesn't look old enough,
does he?

19:10.083 --> 19:12.717
That's the nicest thing
I've heard all week.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.857
So are you in the
education game, Robert?

19:19.859 --> 19:23.294
Security, Troy.
Business is booming.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.662
Time of year.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.732
Thieves everywhere.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.102
So how do you two
know each other?

19:31.104 --> 19:34.539
Oh, me and Robert go way back.
Yeah.

19:43.148 --> 19:46.350
I gotta go.
It was nice meeting you, Robert.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.718
- You too, Troy.
- All the best.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.120
- See you again.
- Yeah. Great.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.855
Take care.

19:54.893 --> 19:56.894
Seems like a nice fella.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.663
So, what are you
doing here, Robert?

19:58.665 --> 20:00.665
Told ya.
I've come to see you.

20:00.667 --> 20:04.068
You've seen my office, so,
thought I'd come and see yours.

20:04.070 --> 20:09.040
Well, now you've seen it.
Let's go for a walk, huh?

20:20.085 --> 20:25.223
Sandy, I couldn't help
overhear Troy talking about
your TV special.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.491
- Ah.
- When's that gonna be on?

20:27.493 --> 20:29.760
Uh... wouldn't have a clue.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.864
Why did you
only ever do one book?

20:33.866 --> 20:35.833
Did you get the old
writer's block, did you?

20:35.835 --> 20:39.604
No. I didn't get
the old writer's block.

20:39.606 --> 20:43.040
- Any sign of my disc, Robert?
- Yeah, I've got it.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.276
It's safe.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.812
It's in my house.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.881
Right, this way.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.285
I watched your
show the other night.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.120
Does that Lucy one fancy you?

20:56.122 --> 20:58.589
No. I wish.
We're just colleagues.

20:58.591 --> 21:02.093
You and that big fruit went at
it hammer and tongs, didn't ya?

21:02.095 --> 21:04.929
- Does he hate your guts, sand?
- Nah. It's all an act.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.897
It just makes for
better television.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.766
No, but I didn't like
the way he spoke to you.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.936
It wasn't nice.
But you were so cool.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.038
Took him apart with your words.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.540
- Well, that's my job.
- Yeah, you're the best in the world.

21:16.542 --> 21:20.645
Being paid to
read books and watch movies.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.913
Do you think I could come
along with you one time and,

21:22.915 --> 21:25.049
you know,
give you a layman's opinion?

21:25.051 --> 21:27.084
Look, Robert,
where exactly are we going?

21:27.086 --> 21:31.022
Just down here. Oh, come on,
we're nearly there now.

21:32.724 --> 21:35.426
Sand, you know
when you was a kid,

21:35.428 --> 21:39.163
did ya, did you ever put
two coins on the track
with a friend?

21:39.165 --> 21:42.166
Kinda like a blood brothers
kinda thing?

21:42.168 --> 21:43.567
No.

21:44.836 --> 21:47.238
No, me neither.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.007
For god's sake, Robert.
We're trespassing.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.677
I didn't see no signs.

21:56.682 --> 22:00.985
I've never been any good
at making friends, Sandy.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.720
I don't know why.

22:06.091 --> 22:08.492
For god's sake.

22:11.197 --> 22:15.399
Robert! I'm never gonna
get that disc, am I?

22:16.535 --> 22:18.069
You crazy fuck!

22:32.017 --> 22:34.018
There you go.

22:40.492 --> 22:42.193
I've seen
this sort of thing before.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.961
- Yeah?
- It's more common
than you think.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.397
- Has he made sexual advances?
- God, no.

22:46.399 --> 22:49.066
- Well, at least not yet.
- You have to be tough with him.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.501
Threaten him with exposure.

22:50.503 --> 22:51.802
Well, see, that's the problem.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.839
- He wants to expose me.
- Expose what?

22:54.841 --> 22:57.842
One accidental
incident of shoplifting?

22:57.844 --> 23:01.178
I take it it was just the once?

23:01.180 --> 23:04.682
Yeah, but it only needs once
for someone in my position.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.384
I really don't want this
to get into the papers.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.386
You just say you've
taken legal advice.

23:08.388 --> 23:11.522
Threaten him with the police.
The main thing is, show no fear.

23:11.524 --> 23:14.825
Be firm and be tough.
Watch him crumble.

23:14.827 --> 23:19.897
Listen, Freddie. Can this
meeting just be between us?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.465
This meeting never happened.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.769
Sandy. Where have you been?

23:24.771 --> 23:27.605
What time do you call this?
I almost give up on you.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.840
Sorry. I was... sorry.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.710
Alright. Don't catastrophize.

23:32.712 --> 23:35.513
Well, it's a line from
your book. Don't you remember?

23:35.515 --> 23:37.214
There's some big words
in here, isn't there?

23:37.216 --> 23:39.583
Me dictionary's in tatters.
Look.

23:40.886 --> 23:44.288
Right. Belfast awakes
to find itself a-wrapped

23:44.290 --> 23:46.190
in a dense shroud of fog.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.426
"Honest and emotional."
<i> The independent.</i>

23:48.428 --> 23:54.432
"A fine de-boot. Sandy Duffy
has a way with words."
<i> The Irish press.</i>

23:54.434 --> 23:58.102
Well, I'll say he does.
Look what he talked me into.

23:59.572 --> 24:00.938
Can I ask you something, Sandy?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.273
Yeah.

24:02.275 --> 24:04.775
I find it difficult
reading properly.

24:04.777 --> 24:10.147
- I hear that.
- I never told
anyone that before.

24:10.149 --> 24:13.050
What'd be really good,
if you could do me one of them,

24:13.052 --> 24:16.487
you know them audiobooks
that you can get?

24:16.489 --> 24:18.155
Hey?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.627
What you doin'
all the way over here?

24:23.629 --> 24:27.164
I just wanted
a quiet smoke, Robert.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.201
We've left our
drinks in there.

24:37.676 --> 24:40.511
Sand,
what's that word say there?

24:40.513 --> 24:44.014
- Peripatetic.
- And what does that mean?

24:44.016 --> 24:48.018
It means to be nomadic.
To wander from place to place.

24:48.753 --> 24:50.221
Sandy Duffy.

24:51.957 --> 24:53.791
Smarter than my dictionary.

24:53.793 --> 24:58.496
Yeah, well,
it's only a wee dictionary.
Look, I've gotta head.

24:58.498 --> 25:01.699
I've an art exhibit this evening
for this week's <i> night vision.</i>

25:01.701 --> 25:03.868
- Oh, great.
- No, Robert.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.270
You're not going anywhere.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.209
What's wrong, Sandy?

25:12.211 --> 25:14.044
Have I done something wrong?

25:14.046 --> 25:16.680
I'm sorry that you're lonely.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.682
But I'm not responsible.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.785
We can't keep
meeting up like this.

25:21.787 --> 25:26.190
I've taken legal advice.
If I don't get the disc tonight,
I'm gonna report you.

25:26.192 --> 25:29.527
Have you ever
surfed the net, Sandy?

25:29.529 --> 25:32.229
Have you ever looked up
cctv footage of shoplifters?

25:32.231 --> 25:34.131
- Oh, god.
- No, listen.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.201
There was this girl, right,
she wasn't even famous.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.704
She only stole
a bottle of shampoo. Yeah?

25:40.706 --> 25:43.340
And she got over a million hits.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.709
Loneliness may not be a
crime but you know what is?

25:45.711 --> 25:49.380
- Blackmail.
- I'm not blackmailing ya.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.415
- I'm just making conversation.
- Really?

25:51.417 --> 25:54.318
I wonder what the police
would think of that.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.986
Let's go and ask them.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.023
Let's see what the papers say.
"Writer steals pen."

25:59.025 --> 26:00.658
- It practically writes itself.
- Oh, yeah.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.393
I'll be in the papers,
but I won't be on my own.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.695
You blackmailed me
into befriending you.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.664
You offered me money
and I said no, if you remember.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.033
- We'll just see what
the police say, eh?
- Yeah, let's.

26:09.035 --> 26:12.436
Especially when I tell 'em
about your other thefts.

26:18.009 --> 26:19.777
What other thefts?

26:19.779 --> 26:21.912
No, you don't know.
You're just bluffing.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.380
We'll find out
soon enough, won't we?

26:23.382 --> 26:24.515
There's no way.
There's just no way.

26:24.517 --> 26:25.950
Really?

26:27.686 --> 26:30.020
Last week, that pen.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.923
Three months ago, a paperweight.

26:34.893 --> 26:39.463
<i> Six months ago, aftershave.</i>

26:39.465 --> 26:42.032
Were they all accidents,
as well?

26:42.034 --> 26:45.603
You must be accident prone.

26:45.605 --> 26:49.406
Funny thing is, your phone
goes off every single time.

26:49.408 --> 26:52.476
What are the odds on that? Hey?

26:52.478 --> 26:56.714
I think the papers'll
still wanna speak to me?

26:56.716 --> 26:59.817
Look, I didn't take legal
advice. No, I made that up.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.085
Be with you in a minute, gents.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.820
Alright, bill. No worries.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.956
We're not going anywhere.
Are we?

27:05.958 --> 27:08.225
You can come to the
art exhibit with me tonight.

27:08.227 --> 27:11.762
You know, give me the layman's
opinion, just like you said.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.765
I'll even start
recording that audiobook.

27:14.767 --> 27:19.069
- What do you say?
- Am I a blackmailer?

27:19.071 --> 27:20.404
No.

27:21.773 --> 27:23.841
Am I a sad little man?

27:24.776 --> 27:28.178
- No.
- Remind me.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.215
- Who's the thief?
- Me.

27:32.984 --> 27:37.688
So who's really
the sad little man?

27:44.129 --> 27:45.629
I could do that.

27:45.631 --> 27:48.032
Or am I missing something,
Sandy?

27:48.034 --> 27:49.633
It's all subjective.

27:49.635 --> 27:53.170
Is it blood? Is it rusty water
from the river?

27:53.172 --> 27:58.442
No, I don't see that. I see
a bath full of tomato soup.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.178
Y'know, I'll be honest with ya.

28:03.882 --> 28:06.450
I did know who you were
when you came into my shop.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.318
Yeah. I mean, you know,
i watched the show.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.120
I wasn't a big fan back
then, but I am now.

28:10.122 --> 28:14.792
I wouldn't miss it now.
You know, everyone knows
who you are.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.560
Who'd have thought it, eh?

28:16.562 --> 28:18.529
Sandy Duffy, a shop-lifter.

28:21.399 --> 28:22.733
Shh.

28:24.502 --> 28:26.470
It's all subjective.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.440
Inevitable.

28:38.516 --> 28:42.119
Ooh, I like this one.
I like the light.

28:43.354 --> 28:45.622
It's a heater, Robert.

28:49.828 --> 28:55.499
Robert... what exactly
do you want from me?

28:58.436 --> 29:01.939
You make it sound like
i wanna stick pins in ya.

29:05.343 --> 29:07.911
I just wanna be your friend.

29:09.614 --> 29:12.449
And this is your
idea of friendship?

29:12.451 --> 29:15.252
Hoarding evidence of me
shoplifting to use against me?

29:15.254 --> 29:18.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
No, you've got this
completely wrong.

29:18.524 --> 29:21.258
I'm not hoarding anything.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.193
Think of it as safe-keeping.

29:23.195 --> 29:26.597
You know, you was gonna
get caught anyway,
wasn't ya, in the end.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.866
Imagine if you'd have got
caught by somebody else.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.567
You'd be finished.
You would.

29:30.569 --> 29:34.404
You wouldn't be at this
fancy art exhibition.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.840
I'm doing you a favor.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.443
Yeah?

29:39.445 --> 29:42.946
So what exactly
am I doing wrong, Sandy?

29:42.948 --> 29:44.181
Tell me.

29:47.886 --> 29:50.087
- Thanks.
- No, it's alright.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.822
Come on, let's go.
I've had enough.

29:51.824 --> 29:54.124
This is crap, this.
It's rubbish.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.293
Absolutely rubbish.

30:39.537 --> 30:44.875
"In the years to come,
he would look back on the day
when the fog came down,

30:44.877 --> 30:48.712
and the streets of belfast
were clogged and blinded,

30:48.714 --> 30:53.684
and when his son wandered alone,
and he wasn't able to find him.

30:55.386 --> 30:58.956
His son was a mystery to him.

30:58.958 --> 31:02.492
Was this the way it was
with all fathers?

31:02.494 --> 31:06.830
Watching them grow and turn
into something unfamiliar?

31:06.832 --> 31:10.033
<i> He was a vagabond.</i>

31:10.035 --> 31:12.536
<i> Disobedient.</i>

31:13.872 --> 31:17.307
<i> How would</i>
<i> this young lad grow old?</i>

31:18.509 --> 31:20.611
<i> What would he become?</i>

31:25.751 --> 31:27.684
Hiya, Robert.
Welcome, come on in.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.087
Oh, thank you very much.
You shouldn't have bothered.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.522
- D'you find it alright?
- Yeah.

31:32.524 --> 31:36.226
- Good. Come on in.
- Wow.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.929
So this is the house
that <i> fog</i> built.

31:38.931 --> 31:42.032
Yeah, I suppose so.
Can I take your coat?

31:42.034 --> 31:44.101
No, you're ok.

31:44.103 --> 31:47.571
Right, well,
let me give you a tour.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.941
And this is my office.

31:50.943 --> 31:53.644
- So.
- Wow.

31:58.716 --> 32:01.685
- What's this?
- Oh, that's Troy's new novel.

32:01.687 --> 32:04.621
I have to read it
and then write a foreword.

32:04.623 --> 32:08.392
- Any good?
- Well, so far so good.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.193
Haven't started it yet.

32:17.268 --> 32:19.236
So are you looking
for something, Robert?

32:19.238 --> 32:22.306
- Yeah, a copy of your book.
- Oh, you won't find that here.

32:22.308 --> 32:25.108
What? You haven't got
a copy of your own book?

32:25.110 --> 32:29.112
No. The original
handwritten manuscript's
here somewhere, but, no books.

32:29.114 --> 32:32.249
Wow. I'd love to see that.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.817
Yeah, well,
I'm not sure where it is.

32:33.819 --> 32:35.485
I'll dig it out for the next
time you come round, eh?

32:35.487 --> 32:38.155
But, in the meantime,
this'll keep you happy.

32:38.157 --> 32:41.658
The first three chapters
of <i> patch of fog.</i> Huh?

32:41.660 --> 32:44.628
- Wow.
- Alright.

32:45.596 --> 32:47.397
Sandy? Can I just...

32:47.399 --> 32:50.000
...just take a quick selfie?

32:51.235 --> 32:52.669
Here you go. Just here.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.338
- Oh, with me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.472
Of course, yeah.

32:56.909 --> 32:58.608
- Alright?
- No, no, no. No good.

32:58.610 --> 32:59.843
We need to be a bit closer,
just a little bit closer.

32:59.845 --> 33:01.144
- Really?
- Ready?

33:01.146 --> 33:03.580
Ok. Ow.

33:04.482 --> 33:05.983
Hey...

33:09.253 --> 33:13.423
- Is that what I think it is?
- Think of it as a peace pipe.

33:13.425 --> 33:17.027
I was a bit harsh on you
in the art exhibit.

33:26.604 --> 33:28.872
I've never done it before.

33:28.874 --> 33:31.241
It's alright. I'm with ya.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.853
That's the spirit.

33:47.225 --> 33:49.092
Oh, exhale, Robert.

33:54.298 --> 33:55.999
Alright?

33:56.001 --> 33:57.868
Yeah. Me head's a bit spinny.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.302
That means it's working.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.838
It's lovely home-grown stuff.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.206
Almost organic.

34:08.413 --> 34:09.913
Wow.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.853
Get the full tension.

34:34.438 --> 34:37.139
- Sandy?
- Hm?

34:38.543 --> 34:40.911
Can I ask you
something personal?

34:40.913 --> 34:42.279
Yeah.

34:43.246 --> 34:45.114
Why do you steal?

34:51.121 --> 34:57.327
There's this...
Intense feeling comes over you.

34:59.030 --> 35:03.100
You're waiting for that
hand on your shoulder.

35:03.102 --> 35:06.770
<i> To be caught</i>
<i> for the first time.</i>

35:06.772 --> 35:11.908
<i> To be shown up as a fraud</i>
<i> in front of the whole world.</i>

35:11.910 --> 35:16.580
<i> Your heart thumps,</i>
<i> your palms sweat.</i>

35:16.582 --> 35:19.783
<i> You even have</i>
<i> difficulty breathing.</i>

35:22.120 --> 35:24.788
It sounds awful.

35:24.790 --> 35:29.059
It's the greatest feeling
in the world.

35:30.728 --> 35:33.497
Provided you don't get caught.

35:33.499 --> 35:37.501
See, you understand.

35:38.336 --> 35:41.605
I can talk to you.

35:41.607 --> 35:45.976
And yet there's still
this elephant in the room.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.377
Yeah.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.747
Yeah, a big pink elephant.

35:53.251 --> 35:59.322
No. Robert,
the elephant is a metaphor.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.359
It means something
that everyone ignores

36:02.361 --> 36:05.929
because they don't wanna talk
about it but it's always there,

36:05.931 --> 36:10.033
getting in the way of
things that really matter.

36:10.035 --> 36:13.103
The discs of me shoplifting.

36:13.105 --> 36:16.706
How can we be real friends when
that's hanging over my head

36:16.708 --> 36:21.745
like the sword of...
Like a big sword?

36:23.047 --> 36:24.981
So what do you suggest?

36:24.983 --> 36:28.351
Well, why don't we
go to your place now,

36:28.353 --> 36:32.322
get it, throw it in the river,
and be done with it
once and for all?

36:32.324 --> 36:35.192
- What do you say?
- Don't you trust me?

36:35.194 --> 36:37.294
Of course I do, 100 percent.

36:37.296 --> 36:40.530
And we've got a connection,
haven't we?

36:40.532 --> 36:43.567
- No doubt about it.
- So why do you want the disc?

36:43.569 --> 36:46.002
So why do you
wanna keep the discs?

36:46.004 --> 36:48.572
I mean, if we're really friends,
don't you trust me, Robert?

36:48.574 --> 36:50.040
Yeah.

36:51.542 --> 36:55.579
I'm keeping the disc
for your safety.

36:55.581 --> 37:02.052
Ah... well, then,
here's to friendship...

37:03.187 --> 37:05.322
...and death to elephants.

37:05.324 --> 37:08.024
Yeah. Death to elephants.

37:08.026 --> 37:09.593
Alright.
Did you have a bag or anything?

37:09.595 --> 37:11.094
- No.
- Ok.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.530
- I'm ok.
- You ok?

37:13.532 --> 37:16.099
- Dave. Alright?
- - How are you?

37:16.101 --> 37:18.101
Cold, isn't it?
Hey, this is on me.

37:18.103 --> 37:19.269
Ok, no problem, thank you.

37:19.271 --> 37:20.604
Thank you.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.906
Front or back, Robert?

37:23.774 --> 37:25.575
- The back.
- Back it is.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.244
You know where
you're going, Dave?

37:27.246 --> 37:29.346
- 39 Barnes road?
- 39 Barnes road.

37:29.348 --> 37:30.580
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.249
- Ok.
- Ok.

37:33.585 --> 37:34.584
It was a good night,
wasn't it, sand?

37:34.586 --> 37:36.253
Ah, the best...

37:36.255 --> 37:38.555
- See you later.
- All the best.

37:38.557 --> 37:41.124
- Text ya.
- Bye.

37:47.632 --> 37:50.700
Morning, Robert.
How's the head today?

37:53.138 --> 37:56.773
Listen, what are you
doing this evening?

38:20.064 --> 38:21.665
Hello, everyone.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.933
I'm John. Um...

38:23.935 --> 38:25.335
What's going on?
Where's Sandy?

38:25.337 --> 38:27.337
He called in sick.

38:27.339 --> 38:28.972
He never told me.

38:28.974 --> 38:31.174
Is he ok?

38:31.942 --> 38:33.410
I don't know.

39:04.475 --> 39:07.043
Hello, Sandy.
Yeah, it's only me.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.813
I was just a little bit
worried if you're not well.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.781
I'm gonna go home now
and feed Maggie and then,

39:11.783 --> 39:14.517
and then I'll pop up
and see how you're doing.

39:31.336 --> 39:33.236
Jesus, fuck.

40:01.699 --> 40:04.267
Jesus. What the fuck?

40:37.568 --> 40:41.004
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

41:46.470 --> 41:48.004
Oh, shit.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.975
Back the fuck off, you.

41:51.977 --> 41:55.545
No, no, no. Over here.
Over here. Here, here.

41:58.315 --> 41:59.682
Yes.

42:00.718 --> 42:01.951
Got ya.

43:42.721 --> 43:44.954
Whoo!

43:50.761 --> 43:53.162
Now, this week,
let's really push ourselves.

43:53.164 --> 43:58.935
Really stretch ourselves.
Life inside a ping-pong ball.

44:02.439 --> 44:04.007
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

44:04.009 --> 44:06.242
Good, good. Sandy,
this is my daughter, Phoebe.

44:06.244 --> 44:07.777
Phoebe, this is
my colleague, Sandy.

44:07.779 --> 44:10.079
Phoebe, very pleased to
meet you.

44:13.951 --> 44:15.585
Could you blow them up for me?

44:20.024 --> 44:23.026
- How did you do that?
- Squashed it.

44:23.028 --> 44:26.329
- Pure brute strength.

44:28.032 --> 44:29.766
Ah.

44:32.436 --> 44:35.104
<i> Ok, everyone.</i>
<i> Phones off, please.</i>

44:39.843 --> 44:42.445
- Hello, Robert.
- - <i> Are you ok, Sandy?</i>

44:42.447 --> 44:45.815
<i>I missed your class last night.</i>
<i> Are you still sick?</i>

44:45.817 --> 44:47.850
No, I'm fine, thank you.

44:47.852 --> 44:50.720
<i> Ah, I wish I could</i>
<i> say the same.</i>

44:50.722 --> 44:53.656
<i> You'll never guess</i>
<i> what happened to me.</i>

44:53.658 --> 44:55.558
<i> I got broken into.</i>

44:55.560 --> 44:58.127
Did they take anything?

44:58.129 --> 44:59.996
<i> Am I ever gonna see you again?</i>

44:59.998 --> 45:03.332
Well, you can see me in a
few minutes. I'm gonna be on TV.

45:03.334 --> 45:05.501
<i> That's not what I mean.</i>
<i> You know what I mean.</i>

45:05.503 --> 45:06.703
<i> I mean seeing you as a friend.</i>

45:06.705 --> 45:08.571
Now, Robert, what do you think?

45:08.573 --> 45:11.374
<i> I think you forgot something</i>
<i> very important about me.</i>

45:11.376 --> 45:15.645
- What's that?
-<i> I'm in security.</i>

45:18.515 --> 45:19.982
Sandy, we're ready for you.

45:19.984 --> 45:21.551
Oh, just a minute.

45:21.553 --> 45:24.120
We're live in 30 seconds.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.460
Sandy, please.

45:37.401 --> 45:40.536
Phones off, everybody.

45:40.538 --> 45:45.108
Ok, we're live in
ten, nine, eight...

45:45.110 --> 45:50.680
- Sandy.
- ...Seven, six, five, four...

45:50.682 --> 45:53.182
Welcome to <i> night vision,</i>
I'm Lucy Walsh.

45:53.184 --> 45:58.087
On this week's show, we'll be
reviewing a new film
by Joe Flynn, and asking...

46:00.892 --> 46:04.827
And we're out.
Four minutes of vt.

46:07.197 --> 46:09.799
Anyone heard any good jokes?

46:09.801 --> 46:11.100
Three polar bears
walk into a bar.

46:11.102 --> 46:13.369
- Excuse me.
- Sandy.

46:13.371 --> 46:16.172
See if he's alright.

46:18.876 --> 46:20.543
Sandy, are you ok?

46:20.545 --> 46:22.478
Yeah, I just need some air.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.980
- Robert.
- - <i> What?</i>

46:23.982 --> 46:25.081
We need to talk.

46:25.083 --> 46:26.482
<i> There's nothing to talk about.</i>

46:26.484 --> 46:28.584
You can't end it like this.

46:28.586 --> 46:30.953
<i> No, you ended it.</i>
<i> Not me, Sandy.</i>

46:30.955 --> 46:34.323
- Sandy,
we're back in two minutes.
- Alright, alright!

46:34.325 --> 46:36.225
<i> Are you feeling alright?</i>

46:36.227 --> 46:38.628
<i> Maybe you're not over</i>
<i> your sickness at all, are you?</i>

46:38.630 --> 46:40.797
<i> You're sweating like</i>
<i> a pig on the tele.</i>

46:40.799 --> 46:42.832
I need to know what you're
gonna do with that video.

46:42.834 --> 46:45.501
<i> Enjoy the rest of the show,</i>
<i> Sandy. I know I will.</i>

46:45.503 --> 46:47.904
Shit.
Sorry for shouting at ya.

46:47.906 --> 46:49.906
It's ok. It's ok.

46:52.576 --> 46:54.477
- <i> It's Robert...</i>
- Shit, shit, shit, shit.

46:54.479 --> 46:56.179
<i> - ...leave me a message.</i>
- Hey, Robert.

46:56.181 --> 46:59.348
It's Sandy. Call me, please.

47:01.986 --> 47:03.953
- Hello?
- - <i> Sandy, what's up?</i>

47:03.955 --> 47:05.621
The way you just bolted?
Is everything ok?

47:05.623 --> 47:08.658
Yeah, bit of an upset stomach.

47:08.660 --> 47:12.028
Listen, I don't think I did
your ratings any good tonight,
at all.

47:12.030 --> 47:15.298
<i> Lucky for you</i>
<i> the viewers only really</i>
<i> tune in for tom and me.</i>

47:15.300 --> 47:17.800
Listen,
can I chat to you tomorrow?

47:17.802 --> 47:20.603
I'm still feeling shattered.

47:20.605 --> 47:23.105
-<i> Ok.</i>
- Alright, bye.

47:44.661 --> 47:46.028
Excuse me, can I help?

47:46.030 --> 47:49.298
No, thank you. Sorry. Excuse me.

48:25.502 --> 48:28.104
Right, let's begin.
Settle down, please.

48:29.240 --> 48:32.008
Ok. Settle down.
Work to do.

48:33.410 --> 48:36.245
That means be quiet or get out!

48:39.049 --> 48:44.020
Thank you. Today we ask
the eternal question.

48:44.022 --> 48:45.087
Which is more important?

48:45.089 --> 48:47.290
Style or substance?

49:07.744 --> 49:13.249
Robert. I can see ya.
Look, open up. For god's sake.

49:13.251 --> 49:16.252
I know I made a mistake
and I'm sorry.

49:16.254 --> 49:19.989
Look, I'm gonna wait
out here in my car.

49:19.991 --> 49:23.359
I'll wait as long
as it takes, ok?

49:31.902 --> 49:34.236
Ah, fuck. Here we go.

49:40.610 --> 49:43.279
Excuse me, sir.

49:43.281 --> 49:45.748
- Everything alright?
- Quite alright, thank you.

49:45.750 --> 49:49.251
It's just we've had a
report of a strange car
loitering in the area.

49:49.253 --> 49:51.787
Am I breaking any law, officer?

49:51.789 --> 49:54.757
Well, there's no need for that.
We're just talking.

49:54.759 --> 49:57.159
But we'll be back
this way shortly.

49:57.161 --> 50:00.629
And if you're still here,
we're gonna have to talk in
more detail.

50:00.631 --> 50:04.567
Well, as it happens,
i was just leaving.

50:50.213 --> 50:51.981
Robert.

50:51.983 --> 50:54.917
Listen, I am so sorry
for breaking into your house.

50:54.919 --> 50:57.453
I was just so scared, man.

51:00.223 --> 51:01.624
Are you ok?

51:11.101 --> 51:12.868
When the police
come to talk to you...

51:12.870 --> 51:14.904
Why would the police
come to talk to me?

51:14.906 --> 51:18.074
That's what they do
in situations like this.

51:18.076 --> 51:20.276
Situations like what?

51:24.448 --> 51:26.882
Just tell them...

51:29.687 --> 51:31.687
I didn't wanna be alone.

51:31.689 --> 51:32.988
What?

51:36.626 --> 51:39.261
Can you hear that, Sandy?

51:40.430 --> 51:42.398
Robert?

51:42.400 --> 51:44.934
Robert, there's a train coming.
Get off the track.

51:44.936 --> 51:46.602
Robert!

51:46.604 --> 51:49.805
Will you get off
the fucking track!

51:50.273 --> 51:51.607
Robert!

51:59.916 --> 52:01.450
Jesus.

52:12.662 --> 52:15.798
Thank you. Thank you.

52:24.574 --> 52:28.377
"Jack marched to the front door
and flung it wide.

52:31.781 --> 52:35.718
<i> The rolling fog crept in</i>
<i> almost at once.</i>

52:39.689 --> 52:41.590
<i> He did not have</i>
<i> long to wait before</i>

52:41.592 --> 52:45.027
<i> the inside and</i>
<i> outside worlds merged.</i>

52:45.029 --> 52:47.663
<i> Would he look for his son?</i>

52:47.665 --> 52:50.966
Would his son look for him?

52:50.968 --> 52:56.372
Would this be the way to
bridge the immeasurable gap
between them?"

53:01.811 --> 53:05.881
I bet you,
if I start in this corner,
you start on that corner,

53:05.883 --> 53:07.683
I'll get to the middle
before you. What do you say?

53:07.685 --> 53:09.718
There isn't enough sheets,
though, to cover the floor,
Sandy.

53:09.720 --> 53:10.886
I'll buy you a new one.

53:10.888 --> 53:12.021
Well, what about
the sofa, though?

53:12.023 --> 53:13.522
Get you a new one of those, too.

53:13.524 --> 53:15.824
But only if you win.

53:15.826 --> 53:21.030
<i> "What kind of man</i>
<i> would put his own well-being</i>
<i> before that of a child?</i>

53:21.032 --> 53:23.666
<i> Jack took a step outside.</i>

53:23.668 --> 53:27.603
<i> He felt his way along</i>
<i> the path to the gate."</i>

53:53.029 --> 53:54.563
Excuse me, miss?

53:54.565 --> 53:56.632
Put that down, please.

53:58.401 --> 54:02.671
At this point,
I'm obliged to tell you...

54:04.941 --> 54:06.575
...that I'm a very big
fan of the show.

54:10.413 --> 54:12.448
For a second there
i thought that you...

54:12.450 --> 54:14.850
What, I was gonna
stick the cuffs on you?

54:16.087 --> 54:17.586
God, I must have
a guilty conscience.

54:17.588 --> 54:19.455
It's all the swag in my handbag.

54:20.858 --> 54:24.693
Thank you,
I'm glad you enjoy the show.

54:24.695 --> 54:28.897
Yeah, I love it.
I never miss it.

54:28.899 --> 54:33.602
You must... you must have your
work cut out, though, eh?

54:34.404 --> 54:35.537
Sorry?

54:35.539 --> 54:36.872
Well, you know.

54:36.874 --> 54:39.308
Keepin' Sandy and tom apart.

54:39.310 --> 54:43.279
Off camera,
they're the best of friends.

54:43.281 --> 54:47.750
- Well, I doubt that.
- What makes you say that?

54:47.752 --> 54:49.985
- Well...

54:54.724 --> 54:56.458
That's mine.

54:58.561 --> 55:00.896
- Is it?
- Yeah.

55:10.106 --> 55:12.675
You make sure
you don't lose that.

55:13.777 --> 55:15.678
Butterfingers.

55:17.247 --> 55:20.749
- Are you ok?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

55:22.585 --> 55:23.852
It's nice to meet you.

55:23.854 --> 55:25.988
- Robert.
- Robert.

55:25.990 --> 55:27.356
You too.

55:27.358 --> 55:29.692
You... you say hello
to Sandy for me.

55:29.694 --> 55:33.128
- I will.
- And you keep up
the good work, Lucy.

55:33.130 --> 55:36.298
- Fantastic show. Fantastic.
- Thank you.

55:36.300 --> 55:39.468
Yeah, fantastic.
Take care.

55:39.470 --> 55:41.870
Bye. Come on.

55:42.672 --> 55:44.006
Happy Christmas!

55:44.008 --> 55:45.674
You too.

55:59.357 --> 56:02.391
Are you hungry, Phoebe?

56:09.666 --> 56:12.735
Met another fan the other day,
didn't we, phoebes?

56:12.737 --> 56:17.039
- Security guard called Robert.
- He was weird.

56:17.041 --> 56:18.807
A bit intense, maybe.

56:18.809 --> 56:20.209
Ok, how to make a pizza.

56:20.211 --> 56:22.144
You pay attention, Phoebe.

56:22.146 --> 56:24.680
So, make two fist.

56:24.682 --> 56:28.717
Spin like frisbee
and then let her rip.

56:28.719 --> 56:30.185
- Oh...

56:30.187 --> 56:31.587
Do you think you
could do better?

56:31.589 --> 56:33.655
- Right, you have a go.

56:33.657 --> 56:35.791
Some of that and that.

56:36.426 --> 56:37.993
Sorry.

56:39.396 --> 56:41.230
That's it.
Go on, get into it, phoebes.

56:41.232 --> 56:43.432
Yeah, good technique.

56:47.904 --> 56:50.506
I don't know how to do it.

56:53.076 --> 56:56.178
Yeah, but can you spin?

56:56.180 --> 56:58.046
That's it. That's it,
that's it, that's it.

57:02.185 --> 57:04.153
There we go. Go on.

57:15.465 --> 57:17.099
That's it.

57:17.867 --> 57:19.368
Are you ok?

57:19.370 --> 57:22.805
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You're turn. Give mum a go.

57:22.807 --> 57:26.008
Alright,
let's show you how it's done.

57:34.984 --> 57:37.119
Ok. You two stay here.
I'm gonna check it out.

57:37.121 --> 57:38.754
- No, don't go out there.
- No, it'll be ok.

57:38.756 --> 57:42.524
No, you don't know
who's out there.

57:44.928 --> 57:47.496
I'll call the police.

57:47.498 --> 57:49.832
Come on, come on, come on.

57:54.571 --> 57:56.438
Excuse me?
Aren't you Sandy Duffy?

57:56.440 --> 57:58.307
Fuck off.

58:01.611 --> 58:02.911
Robert.

58:04.247 --> 58:06.315
Robert!

58:06.317 --> 58:07.950
What the fuck is wrong with you?

58:07.952 --> 58:09.618
I spent half last night
talking to the police

58:09.620 --> 58:12.588
because some dick smashed my
windscreen. And Lucy's too.

58:12.590 --> 58:14.356
- Well, did the police
find out who it was?
- No.

58:14.358 --> 58:17.926
- I covered for you.
- It's too soft.

58:17.928 --> 58:20.295
- Is Lucy alright?
- No, she's not alright.

58:20.297 --> 58:23.365
Nor is her daughter.
This is serious, Robert.

58:23.367 --> 58:25.000
- What's serious, Sandy?
- Well, you turning
up at my house.

58:25.002 --> 58:26.702
- What? You and Lucy?
- What?

58:26.704 --> 58:28.437
Because if I remember,
you told me that youse two were

58:28.439 --> 58:30.205
- both just colleagues.

58:30.207 --> 58:32.674
Right, no, and last night, you
said to me that you were going

58:32.676 --> 58:34.309
home to mark some papers.

58:34.311 --> 58:36.211
So, how do you think I felt
when I looked through

58:36.213 --> 58:38.680
your window and it
looked like the fuckin' waltons?

58:38.682 --> 58:40.215
Oh, that's funny, because
when I looked through my window,

58:40.217 --> 58:41.717
it looked like
the fuckin' mansons!

58:41.719 --> 58:43.352
It's too hard.

58:51.227 --> 58:52.794
- Where's yours, Sandy?
- Oh, for god's sake.

58:52.796 --> 58:54.730
- I left it.
- Don't lie to me.

58:54.732 --> 58:56.532
Shh!

58:56.534 --> 58:58.166
You gave it to her daughter,
didn't you?

58:58.168 --> 59:00.802
- What?
- Aye, I know.

59:00.804 --> 59:04.172
I know what happened.
She asked you to do
the interview.

59:04.174 --> 59:06.341
You said no.
So she hopped into your bed.

59:06.343 --> 59:08.977
- Lucy hopped into my bed.
- She hopped into your bed.

59:08.979 --> 59:11.446
And then you said yes.

59:12.749 --> 59:14.683
You know, she's just
using you, mate.

59:14.685 --> 59:17.185
- Yeah, I've seen it before.
- Mm-hm.

59:17.187 --> 59:21.256
Best thing you can do
is not do the interview.

59:21.258 --> 59:24.393
I don't know if your head's
full of wee sweetie white mice,

59:24.395 --> 59:26.028
but I will be
doing the interview.

59:26.030 --> 59:28.063
And you're so wrong about Lucy.

59:28.065 --> 59:30.132
- Oh, really?
- Really.

59:31.534 --> 59:34.670
- We can all do interviews.
- What?

59:34.672 --> 59:38.440
Imagine the interview
i could do about you.

59:50.954 --> 59:52.988
Ah, fuck this.

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:12.941
So, you're still hell-bent

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:16.712
on a life of quiet
contemplation after the special?

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:18.246
Or can I tempt you
away from all that?

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:22.751
Why are you
still pushing this?

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:26.888
Sometimes I wish the fucking
thing had never been published.

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:31.259
Is it that obsessive?
That fan?

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:33.095
Is that what's
stood your back up?

01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:36.898
No, no. Thanks to you,
all that's sorted.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.233
Is it?

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:46.842
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
fucking work with me!

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:04.393
Alright, mate?

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:43.732
- Change.
- Cheers.

01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:44.966
What time do you stay open till?

01:01:44.968 --> 01:01:47.903
- Twelve.
- Alright, man. Thanks.

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:50.072
Goodnight.

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:25.006
<i> One day there was a fog</i>
<i> and I went out.</i>

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:27.943
<i> Got lost in it.</i>

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:33.448
So, what do you think?

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.884
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm very happy with it.

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:37.786
No, no, I mean,
i mean about the cars.

01:02:37.788 --> 01:02:40.455
- Do you know who did it?
- No, how would I know?

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:43.258
It was probably kids.
They run wild these days.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.961
Not in your neighborhood.

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:51.032
Aren't you forgetting
that I do this for a living?

01:02:51.034 --> 01:02:54.069
I know when someone's
not being honest with me.

01:02:54.071 --> 01:02:56.404
You're imagining things.

01:02:56.406 --> 01:03:00.642
That's what my
ex-husband used to say.

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:08.216
Sorry, I have to take this.

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:16.625
- Yes, Robert?
- - <i> The delivery men</i> <i> are coming at three o'clock</i>

01:03:16.627 --> 01:03:19.294
<i> and I'm snowed under here at</i>
<i> work. Could you do me a favor?</i>

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.663
<i>- Could you let them in for me?</i>
- Yeah, but I don't
even have a key to your...

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:25.734
<i> It's never stopped you</i>
<i> in the past has it, mate?</i>

01:03:32.241 --> 01:03:33.508
Fuck!

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:04.539
Nothing like a drink
after work, eh?

01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:06.341
Where is everything?

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:10.512
Now listen, Robert, I wanted
to make proper amends, you know.

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:11.880
I wanted to go that extra mile.

01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:13.615
So, the lads who
delivered your sofa,

01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:15.650
I got them to take
everything else away.

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:17.986
But don't worry you're
getting brand new stuff.

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:20.856
It's all gonna arrive tomorrow.
So.

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:21.990
Well, what'd you get me?

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:23.391
Well, you got a 40 inch TV.

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:25.393
You got a laminated floor.
You got a bookcase.

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:27.963
You got a coffee table.
You got a rug. You got cushions.

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:30.198
All on me.
All arriving tomorrow.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.466
Ok?

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:33.668
Brilliant.

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:37.939
Right, well drink up because
we've got our night class
to go to.

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:46.314
That's
why I gave her an imaginary
rocking horse as a metaphor.

01:04:46.316 --> 01:04:48.850
Sort of like the fog
in <i> a patch of fog.</i>

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:53.989
- Yes?
- Now I'm sorry to say this

01:04:53.991 --> 01:04:57.158
but that's a load
of nonsense, Vera.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.526
Why do you say that?

01:04:58.528 --> 01:04:59.728
Well, because the fog's
not a metaphor.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.396
- Isn't it?
- No.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:03.732
No, the fog's not imaginary.
Right.

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:06.534
The fog's, the fog's real.
You can see it.
You can touch it.

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:09.905
So how can something real
be a metaphor?

01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:11.706
It does, doesn't make sense.

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:13.842
Maybe you should look up
the word metaphor

01:05:13.844 --> 01:05:16.845
in your wee dictionary, Robert.

01:05:16.847 --> 01:05:18.446
It is Robert, isn't it?

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:32.928
Now, over the break
i want you all

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:36.031
to write a story
based on this video.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.867
Is that you, Sandy?

01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:40.535
None other.

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:43.772
It's a creative arts
project I'm involved in.

01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:45.874
You'll notice that I've
emailed you all a copy.

01:05:45.876 --> 01:05:48.109
I want you to study it closely.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:50.111
Who is this man?

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:54.816
What does he want? What stage
of his story are we at?

01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:58.820
I want you to tell his story.

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:02.791
Use your imaginations
to the full.

01:06:02.793 --> 01:06:05.894
It's only make-believe,
after all.

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:10.231
Have a good break.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.809
Hey. Why did you do that?

01:06:20.811 --> 01:06:23.144
- It'll never work, Sandy.
- Oh, it already has, Robert.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.846
It's typical of my
teaching methods.

01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:27.816
I made the video,
i sent it to my night class

01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:29.317
and that's how
you got hold of it.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:31.086
So why was it shot
in my living room?

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:32.620
- Really?
- It doesn't look anything
like your living room.

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:33.755
Not anymore.

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:35.623
Well, Lucy. I'll tell Lucy.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:37.625
She'll believe me.
I'll tell Lucy what you've done.

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:40.962
Yeah? And I'll tell Lucy
that you're a total nutcase,

01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:42.430
you've been
stalking me for months

01:06:42.432 --> 01:06:43.765
and you probably
wrecked her car, too.

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:45.700
Now who do you think
she's gonna believe?

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:49.804
And if I ever see you again,
if you dare go anywhere near

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:53.108
Lucy or Phoebe, I will set
the police on you like that.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:56.778
Goodbye, Robert.
I wish I could say it was
a pleasure knowing you.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.380
It wasn't.

01:06:58.382 --> 01:07:01.383
No, wait. Don't leave me, Sandy.
Don't leave me.

01:07:01.385 --> 01:07:04.119
Right, if I've done
anything wrong, I'm sorry.

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:05.854
I can change.
But just give me another chance.

01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:07.322
No.

01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:09.357
You jumped in front
of a train for me.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:12.827
I jumped in front
of a train for me.

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:15.663
We're not friends,
we never were.

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:17.332
I despise you.

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:20.035
I've always despised
everything about you.

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:24.239
I only put up with you
because I had to,
and now I don't have to anymore.

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:25.740
Oh, well, I'll still
go to your class.

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:27.809
You can't stop me
from doing that.

01:07:27.811 --> 01:07:29.577
- I'll still get to see you.
- No, you won't.

01:07:29.579 --> 01:07:31.179
You are a disruptive influence.

01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:33.148
If you show your face
around here again

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:35.183
I will see that security
show you off the premises.

01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:37.685
No, no, you can't do that.

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:40.989
I can do that.
See, I'm Sandy Duffy.

01:07:40.991 --> 01:07:43.558
Who the fuck are you?

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:24.299
You're on there.

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:27.769
I'm obliged to call the police.
I'll take you downstairs.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.872
Stand on the street with you,
put me arm on your shoulder.

01:08:30.874 --> 01:08:32.707
We'll wait for the
police to turn up.

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:36.044
Anywhere between
20 and 25 minutes.

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:59.067
Put your money away. Hey?

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:03.904
What happened to one guy
doing another guy a favor?

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:18.386
I get off in 20 minutes.
Fancy a little drink?

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:26.426
Well, fuck off then!
Hey?

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:30.031
Hey?
Who do you think you are?

01:09:30.033 --> 01:09:32.867
Sandy Duffy?
You're not, you know.

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:36.371
Look, get out. Go on.
Go on, get out.

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:19.280
Lucy.

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:48.076
So, after your
mother passed away

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:50.245
your father's anxieties
became more pronounced

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:53.281
and he was diagnosed
with agoraphobia.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:55.450
He never left the house again?

01:10:55.452 --> 01:10:57.685
Only for his own funeral.

01:10:57.687 --> 01:11:02.423
So is the novel
autobiographical?
Or semi-autobiographical?

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:06.928
He was agoraphobic,
but was there really a fog?

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:10.365
Well, it was in the days before
the city had banned coal fires

01:11:10.367 --> 01:11:14.636
and belfast's like a valley,
so the combination of coal fires

01:11:14.638 --> 01:11:20.241
and a cold snap produced a fog
that turned day into night.

01:11:20.243 --> 01:11:22.710
You couldn't see your own hand
in front of your face.

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:24.312
And you got lost in one?

01:11:24.314 --> 01:11:25.380
Yes.

01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:27.348
<i> For how long?</i>

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:31.319
<i> About four,</i>
<i> four and a half hours,</i>

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:32.920
<i> but it seemed a lot longer.</i>

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:34.722
<i> I can imagine.</i>

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:37.425
<i> In fog the father went</i>
<i> looking for the son,</i>

01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:39.627
<i> but your dad didn't?</i>

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:41.095
That's not nice.

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:43.665
<i> The dramatic</i>
<i> inadequacy of reality.</i>

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:46.334
<i> How did that make you feel?</i>

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:50.905
I was six.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.007
How do you think?

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:55.276
- Frightened?
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:55.278 --> 01:11:58.579
- Abandoned?
- Sure.

01:11:58.581 --> 01:11:59.447
Rejected?

01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:03.685
Lay it on, why don't you?

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:09.090
<i> Yet you dedicated</i>
<i> your book to him?</i>

01:12:10.459 --> 01:12:12.627
<i> "For my father George.</i>

01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:15.830
Farewell, my lovely."

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:19.634
Can you remember how you felt
when you wrote those words?

01:12:19.636 --> 01:12:23.371
There was an intense
feeling came over me.

01:12:23.373 --> 01:12:25.440
My heart began to thump.

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:27.709
My palms to sweat.

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:32.347
I even had trouble
breathing for a while.

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:34.282
<i> Quite an emotional moment.</i>

01:12:34.284 --> 01:12:36.517
<i> Yeah, it was.</i>

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:39.687
<i> Difficult moment?</i>

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:42.156
No.

01:12:42.158 --> 01:12:45.760
- It was the greatest
feeling in the world.
- Greatest feeling in the world.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:09.717
Thank you.

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:16.824
Lucy, can I have a moment?

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:22.864
You were right the other day.

01:13:22.866 --> 01:13:27.001
About me seeing
someone else, in a way.

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:29.904
The person who wrecked your car.

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:44.352
You broke into
somebody's house?

01:13:44.354 --> 01:13:46.521
What were you thinking?

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:53.127
That man sounds dangerous.

01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:59.133
No. Robert's really only
a danger to himself.

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:07.375
<i> "Traced his</i>
<i> fingertips along it.</i>

01:14:07.377 --> 01:14:09.043
<i> It felt good to be in contact</i>

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:12.480
<i> with something</i>
<i> so old and strong."</i>

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:33.968
I didn't tell you everything
because I... I didn't want
you thinking badly of me.

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.003
I couldn't bear that.

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:40.341
I don't know what to think.

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:43.144
<i> ...moved further</i>
<i> into the thinning fog.</i>

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:46.447
<i> The granite wall</i>
<i> loomed up before him.</i>

01:14:46.449 --> 01:14:49.717
<i> He traced his</i>
<i> fingertips along it.</i>

01:14:57.326 --> 01:15:03.264
<i> It felt good</i>
<i> to be in contact with</i>
<i> something so old and strong.</i>

01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:05.666
<i> The wall led Jack</i>
<i> to a heavy gate."</i>

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:07.702
Oh, shit.

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:41.903
<i> "Peered through</i>
<i> the bars like a prisoner.</i>

01:15:41.905 --> 01:15:47.008
<i> The fog swirled,</i>
<i> revealing what lay beyond.</i>

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:51.379
<i> Somehow Jack knew he had</i>
<i> reached his destination.</i>

01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:53.714
<i> 'Andy,' he called out.</i>

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:56.150
<i> Dad? I'm over here!</i>

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:01.222
<i> Jack allowed the voice</i>
<i> to lead him.</i>

01:16:01.224 --> 01:16:03.324
<i> The fog parted.</i>

01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:08.195
<i> There sat Andy, shivering</i>
<i> on a slab of cold stone.</i>

01:16:08.197 --> 01:16:10.865
<i> Jack wrapped his boy</i>
<i> in his arms.</i>

01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:12.733
<i> 'I knew you would come, dad.'</i>

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:16.904
<i> 'of course I came. The house</i>
<i> felt so empty without you.'</i>

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:18.773
<i> 'you're not angry at me?'</i>

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:21.208
<i> 'how could I be angry at you?'</i>

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:24.612
<i> 'do you want to go home, dad?</i>
<i> The fog is going.'</i>

01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:25.880
<i> 'don't be scared.'</i>

01:16:25.882 --> 01:16:27.782
<i> 'I'm not scared.'</i>

01:16:27.784 --> 01:16:29.684
<i> 'we'll go soon.</i>

01:16:29.686 --> 01:16:35.256
<i> But first let's sit with your</i>
<i> mum a little while longer.'</i>

01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:36.924
the end."

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.819
How did you get in?

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:07.688
Trade secret, Sandy.

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:12.093
Fancy a drink before
we get started?

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:13.995
Start what?

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:17.665
You stole something from me,
where is it?

01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:20.968
Oh, don't worry.
It's in a safe place.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:23.671
- I buried it.
- Well, I want it back.

01:17:23.673 --> 01:17:25.606
- No, you don't.
- You're a thief!

01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:28.275
And you stole my manuscript.
Where is it?

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:31.545
Well, it's not
really yours, is it? Eh?

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:37.051
<i>A patch of fog</i> by George Duffy.

01:17:39.087 --> 01:17:42.590
And that lovely dedication.

01:17:42.592 --> 01:17:44.659
"For my son, Sandy.

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.961
Farewell, my lovely."

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:49.296
You took that a little bit
literally, didn't you?

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:53.100
Why are you doing this?
Why did you pick me?

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:55.169
I didn't. You picked me, Sandy.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.138
- What?
- You picked me from the start.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.273
You chose my shop.
You bought me a drink.

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:01.609
- You saved my life.
- I told you
the other night that...

01:18:01.611 --> 01:18:04.512
No, all that stuff you said the
other night, you didn't mean it.

01:18:04.514 --> 01:18:06.647
No, you picked me, Sandy.

01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:10.284
Remember when you said
you'd show me the manuscript?

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:12.553
Well, I've seen it now.

01:18:12.555 --> 01:18:16.123
It's ok. It's alright.

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.525
I know.

01:18:17.527 --> 01:18:18.993
Look, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:22.263
Sandy, Sandy.
Sit down. Sit down.

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:28.369
Are you ok?

01:18:30.338 --> 01:18:34.308
My father
was an embarrassment.

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:38.212
He wouldn't step
outside the house.

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:40.981
He knew I wanted to be a writer.

01:18:40.983 --> 01:18:44.185
I found the manuscript
after he died.

01:18:44.187 --> 01:18:47.988
But he turned his greatest
shame into a triumph.

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:51.525
And what did I get?
A lousy fucking dedication.

01:18:51.527 --> 01:18:53.561
Well, fuck him!

01:18:53.563 --> 01:18:55.062
You see?

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:56.597
Come here. Have a drink.

01:18:56.599 --> 01:18:58.566
Have a drink. Eh?

01:18:58.568 --> 01:19:01.235
We'll show him.

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.704
You've been spreading
yourself far too thin, sand.

01:19:03.706 --> 01:19:07.274
Alright? Now it's time
to concentrate
on what really matters.

01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:10.878
Yeah. It's time to concentrate
on writing your own book.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.880
You just have to sign these
resignation letters first.

01:19:12.882 --> 01:19:16.117
- What?
- Well, you know,
<i> night vision,</i> uni.

01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:19.053
You'll have to resign.
You'll have to pack it all in.

01:19:19.055 --> 01:19:22.289
I've already done mine.
You're my job now, Sandy.

01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:25.559
You. That's why
I'm gonna be moving in.

01:19:25.561 --> 01:19:27.561
Hey? You do all the writing.

01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:30.431
I'll do all the cooking
and the cleaning,
and I'll look after you.

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:34.869
Because I know you've got a
great book in you, Sandy Duffy.

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:40.040
Yeah. Just you sign this
and then that's it.

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:41.075
Alright?

01:19:41.077 --> 01:19:42.076
Here you go.

01:19:42.078 --> 01:19:44.779
Come on. Sign it.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.215
You really are mad, aren't you?

01:19:48.217 --> 01:19:50.050
Hey?

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:54.221
If you think I would willingly
entomb myself with you?

01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:57.324
It's not gonna happen, Robert.

01:19:57.326 --> 01:19:59.560
That's not nice, sand.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:04.165
I've done all this for you.

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:06.867
- It's your decision.
- Yeah, it is.

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:11.138
I was just thinking
about Lucy, that's all.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:16.911
- What about Lucy?
- Well, imagine if it comes out

01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:20.281
that Lucy done a TV special
on a paganist?

01:20:20.283 --> 01:20:23.150
She slept with him as well, eh?
How bad's that gonna look?

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:25.653
She'll have to disown you.
Telly will get rid of you.

01:20:25.655 --> 01:20:28.455
You'll lose everything, sand.
This big lovely house.

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:30.624
You'll lose it all.
You'll have no-one.

01:20:30.626 --> 01:20:32.493
Eh? I mean, look.

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:36.463
At least this way you still
get to be Sandy Duffy.

01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:40.434
And I know how much
that means to you.

01:20:40.436 --> 01:20:44.972
You'd rather die
than the truth come out,
wouldn't you, sand?

01:20:44.974 --> 01:20:50.344
You've always found it hard
to make friends,
haven't you, Robert?

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:55.115
- Yeah, until I met you.
- Yeah. I'm you're only friend
though, aren't I?

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:58.853
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:01.155
And now the last people

01:21:01.157 --> 01:21:04.024
who might ask a question
about your whereabouts...

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:08.295
...you've just told
them in this letter

01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:11.465
that they'll never
see you again.

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:16.036
Now you've told me
you buried it.

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:18.505
Where is it?

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:20.975
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Oh, yes you are.

01:21:20.977 --> 01:21:23.410
Now, Sandy.
No, stop it.

01:21:23.412 --> 01:21:28.315
- You wouldn't hurt a fly.
- Huh. No flies on you,
Robert, eh?

01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:31.418
You don't know me.
Where's my fucking manuscript?

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:34.188
- Stop it, Sandy.
- Where is my manuscript?

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:38.492
You've cut me.
Now, I won't be on me own again.

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:40.327
I'll be in the room
upstairs on the left.

01:21:40.329 --> 01:21:42.529
Oh, no, you're fucking not!

01:21:42.531 --> 01:21:45.266
You can't take fuck off
for an answer.

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:48.335
This has gotta stop before...

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:49.570
Sandy.

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.607
Sandy...

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.910
Stop it, Sandy.

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:17.598
Oh, this is ridiculous,
Robert.

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.806
Robert?

01:22:25.808 --> 01:22:28.609
Come on, that's enough.

01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:30.110
Robert.

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:33.948
Robert, I didn't mean it.

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:35.916
As I say, I was
only trying to sca...

01:22:35.918 --> 01:22:38.452
I was trying to scare you.

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:43.123
Shit.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:44.825
Come on, Robert.
Wake up, please.

01:22:44.827 --> 01:22:48.128
Oh, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:52.633
Shit.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:47.267
Fuck.

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:33.580
Goodbye, Robert.

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:43.090
Oh fuck. Shit!

01:27:43.092 --> 01:27:44.858
Shit!

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.326
No!
