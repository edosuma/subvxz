00:07.800 --> 00:08.926
<i>FEMALE NARRATOR'. Tables.</i>

00:09.000 --> 00:12.322
<i>Tables are made so a person
can sit down and do something.</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:14.323
<i>Or nothing.</i>

00:14.400 --> 00:16.209
<i>Any person can sit at a table,</i>

00:16.280 --> 00:18.931
<i>and if the table
is large enough, many people.</i>

00:19.000 --> 00:22.049
<i>To make jokes, eat a meal, tell stories.</i>

00:22.120 --> 00:25.044
<i>Tables are for people
to be together and share.</i>

00:25.120 --> 00:28.044
<i>And that is why tables are like Pied Piper.</i>

00:28.120 --> 00:31.044
<i>Grapefruits, postcards, hugs.</i>

00:31.120 --> 00:33.487
<i>These are things people share
to connect, to become closer.</i>

00:33.560 --> 00:36.689
<i>To open up about ideas and things
that make us feel alive,</i>

00:36.760 --> 00:41.561
<i>like air, ballet, amazing haircuts,
weird countries,</i>

00:41.640 --> 00:46.441
<i>three-alarm chili, mountains,
continents, the Earth, life.</i>

00:46.520 --> 00:50.923
<i>Life is beautiful and sad
and hopeful and dangerous.</i>

00:51.000 --> 00:52.843
<i>So maybe the reason we share so much</i>

00:52.920 --> 00:55.241
<i>is because we understand
that without sharing,</i>

00:55.320 --> 00:57.049
<i>we can't survive.</i>

00:57.160 --> 00:59.401
<i>And sharing is tables.</i>

00:59.480 --> 01:01.323
<i>Pied Piper.</i>

01:02.480 --> 01:06.246
Yes. Tables. I see. It's a metaphor.

01:07.040 --> 01:10.681
- It's a wonderful ad spot.
- Yeah. We're all just tables.

01:10.760 --> 01:12.205
I love what you've done with the place.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.284
It's a really nicely done place.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.448
Say, is that your dog?

01:20.840 --> 01:22.842
It's a dog.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.761
You and I have never really
had much of a rapport, have we?

01:28.280 --> 01:31.329
It's wanting.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.047
Oh, look.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.205
Well, we're almost there.
Prepare to gather, everyone.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.763
No, I didn't say to gather.
I simply said prepare to gather.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.170
- Monica, hey.
- Oh, hey. How's it going?

01:48.240 --> 01:50.368
- You holding up okay?
- Not really.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.488
I know. Her parties are always deeply weird.

01:52.560 --> 01:56.087
Hey, um, I guess this is as good a time
as any to say it,

01:56.160 --> 02:00.290
but I'm really sorry for not getting Pied Piper.

02:00.360 --> 02:04.729
And to be honest, it's really embarrassing
to be so fucking wrong.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.963
Well, here's the thing, you might not be.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.883
What? What are you talking about?

02:11.120 --> 02:12.121
Uh...

02:13.080 --> 02:14.127
Okay.

02:14.200 --> 02:18.683
So, well, Pied Piper launches
and everything's great,

02:18.760 --> 02:22.401
and we spent a fucking bazillion dollars,
on the tables ad

02:22.480 --> 02:26.690
and now we are almost
at 500,000 installs, right?

02:26.760 --> 02:29.286
- Yeah. What's the problem?
- Well, as you know,

02:29.360 --> 02:31.806
installs isn't really the metric that matters.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.049
We need daily active users,
people who come back to the platform.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.487
Okay, so how many daily users
do you actually have?

02:37.560 --> 02:39.005
Okay, what would... What would be a number

02:39.080 --> 02:41.481
that would make you say,
"Oh, that's bad."

02:42.040 --> 02:44.771
I don't know, like, 100,000?

02:45.160 --> 02:46.161
Oh...

02:46.240 --> 02:47.321
Are you less?

02:47.400 --> 02:49.050
How much less?

02:49.840 --> 02:52.730
- Nineteen thousand.
- Nineteen thousand less than a...

02:52.800 --> 02:55.849
- Eighty-one thousand?
- No. No, just 19,000.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.843
- That's the only number.
- What?

02:57.920 --> 03:00.764
- That's... That's terrible.
- Yeah. I'm aware.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.207
- Well, yeah, that's art, not a chair.
- Uh... Oh.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.441
Richard! Oh, my...

03:05.520 --> 03:07.204
Wait, you haven't told Laurie yet, have you?

03:07.280 --> 03:09.282
- No.
- Okay. Well, who else knows?

03:10.160 --> 03:11.810
- Dinesh and Gilfoyle?
- No.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.566
Erlich?

03:14.640 --> 03:15.721
No.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.482
Well, apparently Jared knows.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.406
Yeah, Pied Piper's sort of what I'm known for,

03:33.480 --> 03:36.882
but I'm into a lot of cool stuff.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.644
Like, a lot.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.007
You seem surprised.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.208
I'll give you an example. A few months ago,

03:43.280 --> 03:45.169
I'm at my computer, freestyling,

03:45.240 --> 03:46.890
just kind of jammin' out, you know.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.645
Before I knew it, I had thrown together

03:49.720 --> 03:52.690
the greatest video-chat app
the world has ever seen.

03:52.760 --> 03:56.367
So you invented Skype a few months ago?

03:56.440 --> 03:59.091
Great ideas just sort of flow through me.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.925
The platform, you know,
it's sort of a group project,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.402
but the video-chat app, that's my solo album.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.960
- Oh, Robert.
- I'm Dinesh.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.089
What the fuck is going on with you?

04:13.160 --> 04:14.161
Hmm?

04:14.840 --> 04:16.683
Could you be more specific?

04:17.519 --> 04:18.646
You're hiding something.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.848
What? No, I'm not.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.649
Everything's fine.
You know, everything's fine.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.449
That's a lie.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.443
I could tell because you subscribe

04:26.520 --> 04:30.411
to traditional Judeo-Christian
mores of right and wrong.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.289
You're made uncomfortable by untruth.

04:33.680 --> 04:37.446
My commitment to LaVeyan Satanism
grants me certain freedoms.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.524
There is no good and evil, there's only self.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.971
- Would you like a beverage?
- Yes, I would.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.203
Lie. You just want me to go
to the bar and leave you alone.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.486
Gil... You crack me up.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.527
Lie.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.369
I terrify you, as I should.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.722
Get out of here.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.285
Okay, thank you.

05:07.960 --> 05:11.885
Okay, so, I just spoke with my friend
who runs a market research firm.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.724
- Mmm-hmm.
- She's gonna set up a focus group

05:13.800 --> 05:16.770
for the platform,
put it in the hands of some real users,

05:16.840 --> 05:18.763
and hopefully it'll be super-obvious
what's going wrong.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.486
- Okay, great.
- Clink, clink, clink. Gather.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.483
Faster, please. Gather faster. We're close.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.403
We need to see the numbers change.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.324
499,995,

05:28.400 --> 05:32.803
499,996...

05:36.360 --> 05:38.886
499,997...

05:48.680 --> 05:49.761
It's going great.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.491
They've been engaging with the platform
for about an hour now.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.369
- They're just starting the Q and A.
- Oh, great.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.488
Thank you, everyone,
for sharing your feelings

05:56.560 --> 05:59.166
on the revolutionary new Pied Piper platform.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.722
Now, Bernice, you say here that you were,

06:02.840 --> 06:06.049
"Totally freaked out by the platform."

06:06.120 --> 06:08.566
What specifically totally freaked you out?

06:08.680 --> 06:12.685
Everything. Just every single thing about it.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.364
<i>Just, like, how it worked.</i>

06:14.440 --> 06:19.128
Now, who else found themselves
totally freaked out by this platform?

06:20.120 --> 06:23.124
Barry, Warren, Natalie, Martina,

06:23.200 --> 06:26.283
Gwen, Amy, Walker and Clay.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.488
<i>You were all totally freaked out.</i>

06:28.920 --> 06:30.968
Was anyone not totally freaked out?

06:31.680 --> 06:34.411
Clark? Good. What was your reaction?

06:34.480 --> 06:36.881
It just made me feel stupid.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.002
<i>This file sync thing is confusing.</i>

06:39.080 --> 06:42.243
<i>When I put videos into my main folder,
it says it uploaded them,</i>

06:42.320 --> 06:44.402
but then I didn't see where they went.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.528
It said stuff was on my phone and my iPad,

06:46.600 --> 06:48.967
but when I looked at the memory,
it said, "Zero K used,"

06:49.040 --> 06:50.724
so stuff wasn't on there.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.527
That's the platform.
He's describing the platform

06:53.640 --> 06:55.722
and what's great about it.
Well, clearly he doesn't get it.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.406
Clearly, none of these people get it.
Maybe this is a bad group.

06:58.520 --> 07:01.967
This is the fifth one today
and it's the least hostile reaction we've seen.

07:02.040 --> 07:06.090
Okay, well, everyone that I showed
the beta to loved it. Loved.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.527
- Oh, shit.
- What?

07:09.520 --> 07:10.806
Who did you give the beta to?

07:10.880 --> 07:14.362
- Your friends. Engineers.
- Well, yeah, Monica.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.488
I wanted to give it to people
who would understand

07:16.560 --> 07:19.166
what I'm trying to do,
so I could get useful feedback.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.730
And with all due respect, I gave it to you,

07:20.800 --> 07:22.689
the one person
without a computing background,

07:22.760 --> 07:25.001
and you said it felt engineered.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.803
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.723
You're trying to sell
the platform to regular people,

07:30.800 --> 07:34.407
but you never actually put it
in the hands of regular people.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.641
Like them.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.609
<i>Shouldn't there be a download button?</i>

07:37.680 --> 07:41.162
Did they honestly forget
to add a download button?

07:41.720 --> 07:43.006
You know what, Richard,
why don't we just go...

07:44.880 --> 07:46.484
I mean, who designed this thing?

07:46.560 --> 07:48.801
I did. I designed it.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.730
Excuse me? Who are you?

07:52.560 --> 07:54.927
Uh, my name is Richard Hendricks,
I'm the CEO of Pied Piper.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.047
Oh, my God.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.083
Oh, you're the one

07:58.160 --> 07:59.810
who forgot the download button.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.207
Yes.

08:01.720 --> 08:05.566
But no. No, actually,
there is no download button because, well,

08:05.640 --> 08:07.483
you don't need a download button.
We're past that.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.050
I mean, that's the old thing.
This guy, actually,

08:09.120 --> 08:10.485
he should have told you that.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.130
I'm a moderator, not an advocate.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.168
Okay, well, with Pied Piper,

08:14.240 --> 08:16.891
you don't need to download anything
or send anything at all,

08:16.960 --> 08:20.681
anywhere, because the second
you take a photo or a video

08:20.760 --> 08:24.481
or compose a text message,
it's on all of your devices instantly.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.688
- So it's all on my phone?
- Yes.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.684
Wrong! It says, "Zero K used."
So it's not on there.

08:29.760 --> 08:30.761
Ah-ha!

08:32.159 --> 08:34.765
Yes, well, that's the best part
about the platform right there.

08:34.840 --> 08:38.525
Yes, because you're right,
it's not actually on the phone.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.808
But you don't need it to be on the phone

08:41.880 --> 08:44.531
if you can see it on the phone,

08:44.600 --> 08:46.967
even though there's nothing there at all.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.486
But... Where the hell is it?

08:49.560 --> 08:50.721
Everywhere.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.121
And nowhere, sort of.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.928
Let me... Let me just take a step back here

08:58.000 --> 09:00.765
and explain it in a simpler way.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.524
- Um, sorry, what was your name?
- Bernice.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.887
Bernice, what did you
have for breakfast today?

09:04.960 --> 09:07.645
- Scrambled eggs.
- Scrambled eggs.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.722
And what's in the eggs?

09:09.800 --> 09:11.529
Electrons. Right?

09:11.600 --> 09:14.604
And we all know how
electrons exist in orbitals.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.762
<i>Multivalent states? No?</i>

09:16.840 --> 09:19.161
No one knows this? Okay.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.561
Okay, that's fine. Bad example. That's on me.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.722
I'll... I'm going to use the whiteboard here.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.007
<i>You're gonna... You're gonna love this. Okay.</i>

09:26.840 --> 09:29.605
Then, once we hit a critical mass of users,

09:29.680 --> 09:32.570
the volume of data
moving through the system

09:32.640 --> 09:36.042
will enable the neural net
to start optimizing the platform.

09:36.120 --> 09:39.249
It will actually get smarter
and faster all on its own.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.924
Is that like when I'm texting

09:41.000 --> 09:43.321
and my phone starts guessing
what I'm going to say?

09:43.400 --> 09:45.164
This goes way beyond autocomplete.

09:45.240 --> 09:49.040
Actually, all of your devices
will begin helping each other

09:49.120 --> 09:51.168
in ways that we can't even design or predict.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.848
Okay, but see, the problem is...

09:54.920 --> 09:55.921
<i>Terminator.</i>

09:57.360 --> 10:00.603
What? No. No, no.
No, no, no. No.

10:00.680 --> 10:04.446
I can assure you that there is no
Skynet type of situation here.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.206
No. Pied Piper will in no way become sentient
and try to take over the world.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.922
He just told us he couldn't predict it.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.049
I'm just saying... Everybody died.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.441
- Yeah.
- You're right.

10:16.520 --> 10:20.002
In those movies,
there were a lot of casualties.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.961
Quite scary to think. It's food for thought.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.610
Speaking of...

10:24.680 --> 10:26.330
<i>Can we order some pizzas in here?</i>

10:30.400 --> 10:34.086
So, when we put our files
into a Pied Piper folder,

10:34.160 --> 10:36.049
they get split up into tiny bits

10:36.120 --> 10:40.728
and spread across a network
of other users' devices?

10:40.800 --> 10:43.929
Yes, that's
peer-to-peer distribution. Continue.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.809
But they can't look at any of our files

10:45.880 --> 10:49.407
because they only have tiny,
scrambled pieces of them?

10:49.480 --> 10:51.687
- Encrypted sharding.
- Clark with the assist. Great.

10:51.760 --> 10:55.287
- Uh, go on.
- But we can look at any of our files anytime,

10:55.360 --> 10:59.604
anywhere, even though they're not
actually on any of our devices.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.841
Yes. Yes, Bernice, that's it.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.922
That's Pied Piper. That's everything.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.243
So it's all on our phones
even though it sort of isn't.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.800
Oh, my God. That's awesome.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.291
Isn't it? Yeah.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.085
So, what do you think?
Will you use Pied Piper now?

11:15.160 --> 11:17.686
- Well, yeah, I think I will.
- Me, too,

11:17.760 --> 11:20.525
-now that you've explained how it works.
- There you go.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.443
That's what we've been aiming for.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.406
<i>They get it.</i>

11:25.480 --> 11:27.209
What's he smiling at?

11:27.280 --> 11:30.284
This data was corrupted
the second he walked in that room.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.802
So we're tanking,
and it's because we're too good.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.601
That's one way of looking at it. Uh, yes.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.126
Yes, we have created a product
so far ahead of its time,

11:42.200 --> 11:45.283
people are having difficulty
wrapping their heads around it.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.045
Well, then we just need
to change the platform, right?

11:48.120 --> 11:50.851
- We simplify it.
- Well, we can't.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.447
It's not as if I don't want to,
it's just that we literally can't do it.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.885
Um, if you build an airplane and people
are afraid of anything that flies,

11:57.960 --> 11:59.769
you can't just take the wings off of it because,

11:59.840 --> 12:04.687
at that point, all you're left with
is a really slow, super-expensive shitty bus.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.125
No, we built an airplane, we gotta fly it.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.885
What's the point of flying
if it's fucking empty?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.082
I think people will want to fly

12:13.160 --> 12:16.243
once they realize how cool the platform is.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.448
Guys, I know we're in a tough spot right now,

12:18.520 --> 12:21.126
and I know we needed a quarter-million DAUs

12:21.200 --> 12:23.407
in order to get our next round of funding,
but this is it.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.925
I think we can do this.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.924
All we gotta do is just take
every last dollar that we have,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.923
which is... Sorry, Jared, what?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.209
Well, after the table ads...

12:33.280 --> 12:35.806
...the salaries, recruiter fees...

12:36.840 --> 12:38.410
You know what? I haven't run the numbers.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.608
It would be irresponsible to estimate.

12:40.680 --> 12:43.763
Okay, is it less than a million dollars?

12:43.840 --> 12:46.889
- Oh, God, yeah.
- Okay.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.850
- It's higher than 500,000, right?
- Yeah.

12:50.840 --> 12:54.481
I guess it's about $697,240.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.050
But don't quote me on that.

12:56.120 --> 13:00.682
Okay, we use that money
to do outreach, tutorials,

13:00.800 --> 13:04.885
user meet-ups,
create a guerrilla marketing campaign

13:04.960 --> 13:08.043
that explains how cool the platform is.

13:08.120 --> 13:12.045
I know it's not ideal, but I really think
we can pull this off.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.804
Yeah, that seems doable.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.166
Lie.

13:15.240 --> 13:19.290
Or here's another idea.
We could put the platform on hold,

13:19.400 --> 13:22.290
take the money we have left,
and pivot to something

13:22.360 --> 13:24.886
that doesn't require hours of explanation.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.290
You know, I've been showing
people the video-chat app

13:28.360 --> 13:31.091
-that I hacked together and...
- Shut up, Dinesh!

13:31.920 --> 13:33.888
You ungrateful pricks, all of you.

13:34.520 --> 13:39.321
Your tepid response to our intrepid boss
makes me ill.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.526
His plan, will it work? Mmm-mmm.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.044
Almost certainly not.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.930
All of you will likely look back
at this time in your lives

13:48.000 --> 13:51.800
and realize you wasted a whole year
with nothing to show for it.

13:51.880 --> 13:55.521
But if this company is a plane,
then this is Richard's goddamn plane,

13:55.600 --> 13:58.365
and if he wants to fly it
into the side of a fucking mountain,

13:58.480 --> 14:02.041
that is his prerogative
and it is our duty to climb on,

14:02.120 --> 14:06.489
strap in and have a fiery death
right behind him.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.400
I don't...
I don't know about that, but...

14:09.480 --> 14:11.528
Richard, the floor.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.968
Crashing aside, I think this is the plan, and,

14:15.080 --> 14:17.890
really, what other option do we have?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.883
Well, I know what option I have.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.121
I can quit.

14:23.920 --> 14:24.921
So I quit.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.811
Okay. Any... Anybody else?

14:30.640 --> 14:32.165
Guys, no.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.288
Look, Douglas,

14:34.360 --> 14:36.362
customer support is going
to be a big part of this.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.250
We need you guys
if we're going to get 250,000 users.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.243
I barely have any customers
to support, Richard.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.049
And the only way
you're going to get that many users

14:43.120 --> 14:46.329
is if you go to one of those click farms
in Bangladesh and pay for them.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.170
Good fuckin' luck, man. I'm out.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.965
- Guys, wait.
- Jared, let them go.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.849
I have to do their exit interviews.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.161
I guess I can do them
on their walk to their cars.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.286
Richard, we're better off without them.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.566
Lie.

15:03.480 --> 15:07.326
This is intolerable.
A man can only take so much.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.921
- Mmm-hmm.
- Banished from my own company? No.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.809
I'm just going to give them what they want.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.006
I'm going to resign.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.930
We can go to Haiti, build orphanages.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.331
Haiti?

15:21.120 --> 15:25.808
Is it not said that one should
think globally and act locally?

15:25.880 --> 15:27.405
I'm not acting at all.

15:28.160 --> 15:32.006
Lao Tzu teaches
the best fighter is never angry.

15:32.080 --> 15:35.641
More important than the blow
is knowing when to strike.

15:35.720 --> 15:39.281
Like, perhaps, after we experience

15:39.360 --> 15:42.603
the executive white water
rafting trip in Coeur D'Alene?

15:45.960 --> 15:47.610
Gavin, do you have a moment?

15:48.800 --> 15:50.040
Yes.

15:50.840 --> 15:51.841
Alone?

15:52.400 --> 15:53.640
Of course. Denpok?

15:53.720 --> 15:54.721
What?

15:55.320 --> 15:56.845
Give us a moment, please?

16:02.880 --> 16:05.565
Gavin, I'm really not
supposed to be talking to you,

16:06.560 --> 16:08.449
but there's something
I think you should know about.

16:08.840 --> 16:09.887
I'm listening.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.123
A customer service rep
that just left Pied Piper

16:13.240 --> 16:15.607
is on campus right now
interviewing for a job.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.931
Why would anyone leave Pied Piper now?

16:19.040 --> 16:21.691
I thought maybe
you'd want to ask him yourself.

16:23.760 --> 16:24.761
Well done.

16:25.560 --> 16:26.561
Well done.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.051
Okay. Thank you for coming in, Douglas.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.804
- Yeah.
- Right this way. Okay.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.761
Uh...

16:37.760 --> 16:38.761
Douglas.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.970
Consider the possum. Nature's...

16:44.040 --> 16:46.611
Gavin, if you're bringing another animal
into this boardroom,

16:46.680 --> 16:50.480
-this meeting is over.
- Of course not. Don't insult me.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.250
Gentlemen and lady of the Hooli board,

16:54.320 --> 16:57.210
I am the possum to which I refer.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.851
Playing dead to outwit those
who wish me harm.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.285
But it's time to end the charade.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.408
I'm sorry, Gavin. What charade?

17:03.480 --> 17:07.530
For months, I've led the world to believe
that my EndFrame division was pursuing

17:07.599 --> 17:11.685
a broad-based compression platform
in direct competition with Pied Piper.

17:11.800 --> 17:16.442
But secretly, I knew that any such platform
was destined to fail.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.647
But Pied Piper is not failing.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.007
It's the most popular app in the Hooli store.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.560
One of the most installed, yes.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.928
But I happen to know, because
I make it my business to know,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.606
that their daily active user numbers
are abysmal.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.448
So, you were never developing a platform.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.010
Why didn't you tell us this?

17:36.000 --> 17:40.449
Says the chairperson of the board
that recently asked for my resignation.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.648
Trust cuts both ways.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.166
I thought it best to leave you out of it.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.730
I'm sorry, Gavin,

17:46.800 --> 17:49.007
I'm just finding all of this
impossible to believe.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.924
If you were never building a platform,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.606
what did we just spend
three-quarters of a billion dollars on?

17:54.200 --> 17:55.850
I'm not going to tell you.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.927
Instead, I'm going to let
the new head of product

17:59.000 --> 18:00.650
for Hooli/EndFrame tell you.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.209
Hello, everyone.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.170
I'm Jack Barker, and I'm very excited

18:08.240 --> 18:11.926
to introduce Hooli/EndFrame's
newest product...

18:13.000 --> 18:16.607
We call it The Box.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.687
Pied Piper's loss is Hooli's gain.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.690
May the best product win.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.563
Can I get you a shirt, sir? There you go.

18:29.640 --> 18:32.530
<i>Actually, let me ask you a question, Emily.</i>

18:32.600 --> 18:34.443
<i>What did you have for breakfast today?</i>

18:34.520 --> 18:36.409
<i>- Um, yogurt.
- Okay.</i>

18:36.480 --> 18:39.211
<i>And we all know what's in yogurt, right?</i>

18:39.280 --> 18:41.647
<i>Electrons. Multivalent states.</i>

18:46.160 --> 18:48.686
Welcome to the Pied Piper
Informational Seminar.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.611
Now, what is Pied Piper? Excellent question.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.480
Here it is.

18:54.240 --> 18:57.961
One of your Hooli/EndFrame boxes
would go right here in this rack.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.486
Okay, let me show you the next location

19:01.560 --> 19:03.562
in which we would install one of your boxes.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.850
- Congratulations, Jack.
- And congratulations to you, Gavin.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.571
- Hey, John? John?
- John?

19:15.440 --> 19:17.329
A lot of people have raised their hands

19:17.400 --> 19:20.085
throughout this seminar saying,
"Hey, is this thing like the Terminator?"

19:20.160 --> 19:22.208
Uh, no. Not at all.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.203
Hi, how big are your files?

19:24.280 --> 19:26.169
Dodge Challenger?

19:26.240 --> 19:27.241
Hoodie?

19:43.520 --> 19:46.364
- John?
- Yo!

19:46.440 --> 19:48.761
- John?
- John!

19:48.840 --> 19:50.808
John!

19:51.360 --> 19:53.044
This is Pied Piper, guys, okay?

19:53.120 --> 19:54.770
If I could just explain it one more time.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.691
Guys? Please don't leave. I beg you.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.442
Hi, Bernice. Yeah.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.726
We kind of thought
we nailed it with tables,

20:17.800 --> 20:21.247
but you say you want something
light, fun, inviting.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.848
But most of all, you want something
that delivers

20:23.920 --> 20:27.208
a step-by-step guide
to all of the nuances of your platform.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.884
- Yeah.
- All of this with the caveat that

20:28.960 --> 20:31.611
you don't have enough money
for even a minuscule ad buy.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.801
Yes, that's right.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.009
That's a pretty small target to hit.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.322
Anyway, here's what we came up with.

20:41.520 --> 20:45.320
<i>Oh, hello, welcome to Pied Piper.</i>

20:45.400 --> 20:46.970
<i>How can I help you?</i>

20:50.320 --> 20:52.687
What in the name of fuck is that?

20:53.840 --> 20:56.411
Well, his name is

20:56.480 --> 20:59.131
Pipey, the Pied Piper piper.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.921
He's fun. And, you know,
the demo's interactive.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.206
Just...

21:04.280 --> 21:06.328
<i>Looks like you want to compress a movie file!</i>

21:06.400 --> 21:09.643
<i>Can I help? You know,
with Pied Piper's revolutionary</i>

21:09.720 --> 21:13.281
<i>neural network, optimized,
sharded data distribution system,</i>

21:13.360 --> 21:17.684
<i>it's just six clicks away! Follow me!</i>

21:18.640 --> 21:21.450
- I like it.
- That's a fuckin' lie.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.567
Yeah.

21:22.640 --> 21:26.406
So, Richard, you want us
to take the most sophisticated

21:26.480 --> 21:29.324
and technically complex
compression-based platform

21:29.400 --> 21:33.086
- ever created and add that?
<i>- Still</i> here!

21:35.600 --> 21:40.561
Well, after the booths
at CES and South by Southwest,

21:40.640 --> 21:43.689
- all of our outreach, the Dodge Challenger...
<i>- Still</i> here!

21:43.760 --> 21:47.481
Plus, all the cost of working up,
you know, this,

21:47.560 --> 21:51.246
-we are pretty much all out of money.
- Follow me!

21:53.920 --> 21:55.285
Okay.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.765
<i>Uh-oh. Somebody seems confused!</i>

21:58.840 --> 22:00.922
<i>Let me walk you through
Pied Piper's proprietary</i>

22:01.000 --> 22:03.571
<i>peer-to-peer content distribution system.</i>

22:10.960 --> 22:13.167
Richard? Are you indisposed?

22:13.240 --> 22:14.810
Richard, can I come in?

22:18.280 --> 22:20.931
Richard, I'm sorry the guys didn't like Pipey.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.046
It's over, Jared.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.925
Well, you know, a lot of animated characters
have rough starts.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.810
Early Bugs Bunny cartoons
were just garish displays

22:30.880 --> 22:32.689
of anti-Japanese hysteria,

22:32.760 --> 22:34.683
and now he's the face of Warner Bros.

22:34.760 --> 22:38.128
I'm not talking about Pipey, Jared.
I'm talking about Pied Piper.

22:38.800 --> 22:42.930
We're dead. We fought Gavin Belson,
Russ, Hooli,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.367
the lawsuit, that fucking Box,

22:45.440 --> 22:47.966
all so we could build our platform
the way we wanted to.

22:48.040 --> 22:53.649
And we did, but I guess
you just can't fight public opinion,

22:53.720 --> 22:57.008
except for one woman named Bernice.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.009
Face it, Jared, being too early
is the same as being wrong.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.161
Hey-

23:06.520 --> 23:09.251
- We'll figure it out.
- I don't know if we will.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.730
Besides, I think I'm getting tired
of being kicked in the balls.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.121
Come on, we have a few weeks of runway left.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.043
Uh, I don't want to say exactly how much.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.122
Again, I'm not comfortable estimating, but...

23:20.200 --> 23:24.205
Take what's left of it
and divide it up amongst the guys.

23:24.280 --> 23:27.090
I mean, it won't be anywhere close to
what you're owed in back pay,

23:27.160 --> 23:28.571
but at least it's something.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.928
Don't give up. Richard, come on, not yet.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.923
We've got to hang on,
we've got to see what happens.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.843
Something could turn around. I know it will.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.488
- You really believe that?
- Absolutely.

23:40.800 --> 23:43.531
Gilfoyle's right, you're a terrible liar.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.005
Um, just set an all-hands
for tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.082
And I'll tell the gang.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.401
It's over, Jared.

23:58.680 --> 24:02.207
And lastly, our deal
to furnish EndFrame boxes

24:02.280 --> 24:05.124
to Maleant Data System Solutions
has officially closed,

24:05.200 --> 24:09.046
putting us far ahead of
even the most optimistic profit targets

24:09.120 --> 24:10.565
issued by this very board.

24:10.640 --> 24:14.565
Gavin, it appears we owe you an apology.

24:14.680 --> 24:17.570
We'd like to restore
your full status as CEO and chair

24:17.640 --> 24:21.725
with a significantly revised bonus
and stock options package.

24:22.600 --> 24:23.761
Thank you.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.127
Of course, apology accepted.

24:26.200 --> 24:29.124
I would like nothing more
than to move forward

24:29.200 --> 24:31.487
in a harmonious and productive manner.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.449
Actually, with that in mind,

24:33.520 --> 24:35.887
there's something I'd like to show you.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.964
It's outside. Is that all right?

24:39.080 --> 24:40.730
A little field trip, if you will?

24:43.080 --> 24:44.411
Just down here.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.571
A little farther.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.001
We're almost there.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.401
Just out here, everyone. Almost there.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.484
Consider the elephant.

25:00.600 --> 25:07.006
Legend has it its memory
is so robust it never forgets.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.082
And I assure you,
gentlemen of the Hooli board,

25:09.160 --> 25:12.687
and lady, neither do I.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.603
Okay, guys, uh,

25:29.000 --> 25:32.368
we need to have a serious discussion
about the future of the company.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.204
What? Why is everyone smiling?

25:37.280 --> 25:39.009
Richard, something happened last night.

25:39.840 --> 25:43.003
The daily active users are up, way up.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.561
- Look at it. Look.
- Really?

25:46.640 --> 25:47.641
Holy shit!

25:49.040 --> 25:50.929
Did we just get 7,000 users in a day?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.445
We sure did! We're back!

25:52.960 --> 25:54.644
I don't know if it was the outreach

25:54.720 --> 25:57.803
or the tutorials,
but we seem to be getting traction.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.281
Richard, you pulled us out of a nosedive.

26:00.360 --> 26:05.287
Of course, inevitably, we will run out of fuel
and plummet towards the Earth,

26:05.360 --> 26:08.967
leaving only a crater behind
of torn flesh and excrement,

26:09.040 --> 26:11.520
but in the meantime, we are flying high!

26:11.600 --> 26:13.887
Yeah. I guess we are.

26:13.960 --> 26:15.928
You know, it's crazy, just last night I was

26:16.000 --> 26:18.731
telling Jared that I thought
we should shut down the company.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.485
Well, perfect timing then, huh?

26:25.280 --> 26:26.281
Oh.

26:26.360 --> 26:27.885
Excuse me. I should get this.

26:29.680 --> 26:30.681
Hey, Jared.

26:33.360 --> 26:36.250
- Are those numbers legit?
- Of course.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.685
- All right, then.
- This is Jared.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.726
<i>MAN". So, are we happy?</i>

26:42.800 --> 26:44.882
Yeah. Worked out great.

26:44.960 --> 26:48.965
So let's keep the 7,000 users that I bought

26:49.040 --> 26:51.964
and add another thousand a day
for the next week.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.485
<i>You got it, buddy.</i>
