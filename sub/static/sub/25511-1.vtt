05:24.210 --> 05:30.000
Even old flesh is erotic flesh.

07:27.170 --> 07:31.210
They say, that in the valley of the rats,

07:32.130 --> 07:36.070
there is no chair for the Lords of the Earth.

08:05.020 --> 08:06.230
Hey Jesse!
- Bobby.

08:07.130 --> 08:09.160
It is a sweet ride. - Thanks.

08:11.050 --> 08:12.180
How much did it cost you?

08:14.160 --> 08:17.170
I mean did you get a deal on it or something?- No.

08:18.230 --> 08:21.070
So I don't get it.- Get what?

08:21.120 --> 08:25.110
This.
- I'm not sure I'm following you.

08:27.030 --> 08:28.130
It was a stupid movie.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.140
I don't think you're getting the point.

08:32.020 --> 08:34.020
There was nothing to get.

08:36.220 --> 08:38.090
Is this just for fun?

08:38.220 --> 08:43.100
Is this fun for you? Because that, I could understand.

08:44.010 --> 08:50.180
But wanting to reenact... That seems a bit... - Silly?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I do not get it.

08:55.060 --> 09:03.200
Besides, it's too constructed. You want your friends, and your ex-girlfriend and you're in and out of a moving limousine...

09:05.110 --> 09:07.110
It's not a wedding, Bobby.

09:08.130 --> 09:15.970
Hey asshole, you have to time the pick up locations for this to even make it work. There is no natural ability to it.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.020
Naturability?

09:20.230 --> 09:22.190
Ok. I'm getting out.

09:23.090 --> 09:27.140
Look. I mean... I'm not supposed to meet her for another 10 minutes. We could hang out.

09:27.210 --> 09:30.070
You said I could unload whatever I wanted.

09:35.020 --> 09:36.130
What the fuck?

09:47.230 --> 09:53.090
So, you just get out of jail? You got a rich uncle or something?

09:53.210 --> 09:55.050
Nah. I wasn't in jail.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.010
I was in holding for 36 hours then they had to let me go.- Ok... [murmurs]

10:05.190 --> 10:07.190
That's cool, man.

10:16.030 --> 10:18.110
So you've seen Amanda recently?

10:19.000 --> 10:23.160
About... 10 minutes ago? -That is pretty recent.

10:26.170 --> 10:29.000
How about you, Dick? Have you seen Amanda lately?

10:29.150 --> 10:31.060
No.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.200
Nothing recent.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.160
So what's the plan?

10:43.110 --> 10:46.210
Ride around all day, getting drunk?
-Something like that.

10:49.140 --> 10:51.140
I've heard worse plans. -Yeah.

10:53.180 --> 10:56.100
So Dick, I was just thinking...

10:57.220 --> 11:03.050
You saw a lot of Juliette without me knowing.

11:06.020 --> 11:09.090
What do you mean?
- Just that you two would hang out a lot.

11:12.140 --> 11:18.190
A lot from your perspective. I mean, Jesse, she was a human being, not a possession...

11:19.010 --> 11:21.220
Well I'm just saying Dick, like...

11:23.010 --> 11:25.230
She was free to hang out with whoever she wanted, ok?

11:39.230 --> 11:41.100
Thanks, brother!

11:47.010 --> 11:49.010
I'm gonna find out who killed her.

11:50.030 --> 11:51.230
It's fine. It's good.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.110
Dick, I wanna ask you...

12:05.230 --> 12:07.170
Do you have any idea who killed her

12:09.030 --> 12:11.030
No. Why, should I?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.100
Well, technically, you were the last person to see her alive.

12:15.170 --> 12:17.000
Officially, you were.

12:17.050 --> 12:21.050
Yeah. According to certain pigs.

12:22.090 --> 12:26.090
Well, if the media says you did it, then you did it.-Yeah. Fuck.

12:37.070 --> 12:40.120
This is not the conversation I envisioned having.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.220
What was the conversation you were envisioning?
...Fuckhead.

12:52.004 --> 12:54.040
I'm getting out.

14:24.170 --> 14:26.017
We should go!
-Yeah.

14:28.002 --> 14:30.002
-So, let's go!

16:44.010 --> 16:47.010
Even old flesh is erotic flesh.

17:09.010 --> 17:11.950
I'm not sure why I'm doing this.- I'm sorry.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
What?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
This is a bit silly, isn't it?

17:21.010 --> 17:22.020
It's good to see you.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.520
Do you have all this scripted?

17:25.020 --> 17:29.000
No, I'm just going with the flow!

17:30.010 --> 17:31.020
Right.

17:37.010 --> 17:39.310
You ever fucked in the back of a limousine?

17:40.010 --> 17:42.020
Yes. Once.
- How was it?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I was drunk.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.320
I have some vodka here...

17:51.010 --> 17:53.010
Do you wanna fuck in the back of a limo?

17:59.010 --> 18:04.000
Why not?- Because we're not lovers anymore, that's why not. But sure, I'll have a drink.

18:12.020 --> 18:16.020
Sorry, no ice. - Sorry, no fucking.

18:23.010 --> 18:25.010
Wish I'd have saved some of my slushee.

18:26.010 --> 18:28.010
I can get you another slushee.

18:29.010 --> 18:35.000
Is that code for something?
- That was always your problem Jesse. You read way too much into things.

18:35.010 --> 18:38.000
It's cinematic.
- It's unrealistic.

18:38.010 --> 18:40.010
That was never our problem, Amanda.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.010
You know, you're right. That wasn't.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.010
So...

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Where did things go wrong?

18:54.010 --> 18:57.020
You killed your old girlfriend, Jesse, that's what happened.

18:58.020 --> 19:00.020
You know that's not true.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.010
The police thought it was true.
- Typical conservative pigs. I didn't kill her.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Yeah, that's right, they are all conservative pigs, Jesse. And here we are, riding around in a limo.

19:11.020 --> 19:14.310
Look, I don't own this limo, I had to rent it!

19:15.010 --> 19:18.010
So you are a hipster conservative? Nice.

19:20.020 --> 19:23.000
I'm going to find out who killed her, Amanda.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah, well good luck with that. I'm getting the fuck out. Thanks for the drink.

19:53.010 --> 19:56.000
Your spirit, it's not from here.

20:00.020 --> 20:02.010
It appears to be from Russia!

20:05.000 --> 20:09.010
Some spirits are from here. We call it the dregs.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.010
People like me. From the valley of the rats...

20:53.000 --> 20:57.020
[Whispers] I'll always be with you. Always.

22:28.010 --> 22:31.010
Fifty cents... I remember when these were a quarter!

22:32.020 --> 22:35.010
My mom puked on that phone last night.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.000
Thanks!

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Hello. How is your night going, boss?

29:24.000 --> 29:25.010
I'm not your boss, ok?

29:27.010 --> 29:30.020
You are paying me, but whatever you say, boss.

29:31.010 --> 29:35.020
Tell me, do you hear everything that happens back here?

29:43.010 --> 29:50.000
Well, mostly I'm tuning out, but yeah. If you wanna get technical about it, I can hear everything.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.010
It's not a matter of privacy, only if there was to be any sort of emergency...

30:00.000 --> 30:06.010
Nah, it's fine, I understand. It's nothing you can't read about on the internet! If you wanted to.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Except for the hooker.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.010
That's nothing new here.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
Just so you know, everything's kosher.
-It's fine.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.010
What's your name, driver?- It's Luke.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.010
- Short for Lucas? - Not exactly.

30:33.020 --> 30:39.000
Well, Luke, I'd like you to have a drink with me.

30:40.010 --> 30:44.950
Fuck. Sorry.
- That's alright, boss.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Maybe next time.- Yeah, sure.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.020
So, is there something you needed to see me for?

30:57.010 --> 31:01.010
Still got a couple of hours of driving left.
- I wanted to ask you something.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
What do you make of all of this?- Make of all what, boss?

31:08.010 --> 31:13.000
This. All this shit back here.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
You know, I know you haven't tuned it all out, so I just wanted to know...

31:20.010 --> 31:22.020
What do you think?

31:25.000 --> 31:32.960
Look, sir. It doesn't matter what I think. I drive, that's it.

31:33.010 --> 31:36.010
I don't get involved. I can't

31:37.010 --> 31:42.010
You think your shit back here is the worst thing I've ever seen?You think I would've been shocked?

31:43.020 --> 31:48.010
I have heard and seen shit that'd curl the skin off your yuppie face.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.310
You think your shit's the end of the world. It's not.

31:55.010 --> 31:57.020
There is no "end of the world", sucker.

31:58.000 --> 32:03.010
This shit... Your shit... My shit... All the shit in this city...

32:04.000 --> 32:07.010
It just keeps it all going. And it's always gonna keep going.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.960
Long after you and me and everyone we've ever known is long gone...

32:13.010 --> 32:16.020
This city is just gonna keep on keepin' on.

34:07.010 --> 34:09.010
It's been a long time...
...A long time ago...

34:16.000 --> 34:20.010
Only our dreams have not been humiliated.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.010
I hope to see you around, Jesse.

36:16.010 --> 36:18.010
So, let's go!

45:50.000 --> 45:52.410
Why do you feel like you have to destroy everything?

46:15.000 --> 46:20.010
You can't create through destruction.
- You can only create through destruction.

46:22.010 --> 46:24.820
I think that's a dangerously capitalistic point of view.

46:25.020 --> 46:27.020
I'm not a capitalist.

46:29.010 --> 46:31.010
There are other ways to make your point!

46:32.000 --> 46:34.010
I'm not trying to make a point.

46:36.010 --> 46:39.010
You are trying to take over the city by using fear.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
I AM THE CITY!

47:10.000 --> 47:11.010
I am the city.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.020
Fear's no good.

47:29.020 --> 47:31.010
So, you're afraid of me?

47:34.010 --> 47:35.010
Of course not.

47:36.020 --> 47:39.010
So, then...?- So then nothing.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.010
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
Exactly. That's what we are.

47:49.020 --> 47:53.000
Kings, and Queens, of nothing!

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
In the land of the nymphs, the praise of Folly...

48:01.000 --> 48:02.010
Remember folly?

48:03.010 --> 48:05.010
Folly was a goddess.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
I'd heard a story once. About two cities around the hills somewhere...

48:19.010 --> 48:23.020
Hills? Which hills?- I don't know where, I don't remember.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.950
Anyway, the cities would perform this ritual where they would battle each other.

48:30.000 --> 48:35.010
Only not with regular soldiers. The people in the city would climb over each other like acrobats.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.010
...and form these gigantous creatures!

48:40.000 --> 48:43.960
...Each person becoming a muscle working these creatures like two giants,

48:44.010 --> 48:48.020
pulled together by the connecting works of human beings, forming the legs...

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
...the torso, the arms, the hands...

48:52.010 --> 48:53.020
...even the fingers.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.010
And then, it would battle against each other.

48:58.010 --> 49:00.010
Why?

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
I don't remember.

49:04.020 --> 49:07.010
So, you remember the imagery of the story, but not the story itself?

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
I guess so.

49:12.010 --> 49:16.010
You remember what you wanted to remember. Just like everyone else.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Why the limo, Lina?

59:21.020 --> 59:25.010
I'm not sure. I usually prefer cabs.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.510
Why did you kill your boyfriend?

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
I didn't.

59:31.010 --> 59:32.820
Are you sure about that?

59:36.000 --> 59:37.410
He wasn't my boyfriend.

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:43.010
So, why did you kill your boyfriend?
