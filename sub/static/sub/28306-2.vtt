-(rhythmic breathing)
-(drumroll, fanfare)

00:07.175 --> 00:10.778
ANNOUNCER: Fosse/Verdon.
All new, Tuesdays at 10:00
on FX.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.049
ANNOUNCER: FX presents
What We Do in the Shadows.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.488
NADJA:
Are we almost there?

00:20.521 --> 00:23.657
All this walking and walking
and walking, Guillermo,

00:23.691 --> 00:25.659
do you never tire of it?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.228
Screw this. I'm flying.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.263
Who's with me? Bat!

00:29.297 --> 00:31.399
NADJA:
He doesn't have the address,
so, you know...

00:31.432 --> 00:33.134
I don't have the address.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.569
Vampires love virgins.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.271
It's their favorite food.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.407
And, um, I've managed
to find a group

00:39.440 --> 00:42.410
with an extremely high ratio
of virgins.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.345
So, LARPing,
as you probably know,

00:44.378 --> 00:46.580
stands for
Live Action Role-Playing.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.182
You will give me the scroll,

00:48.216 --> 00:50.618
or you will taste the wrath
of my pike.

00:50.651 --> 00:51.952
JENNA:
Some people think that

00:51.985 --> 00:53.754
we kind of mix up reality.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.189
Don't worry, we're well aware.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.791
Um, we know it isn't real.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.393
No, it's real.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.628
Yeah.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.930
Roll for intimidation.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.265
(dice clattering)

01:04.298 --> 01:05.466
JONATHAN:
Negative for intimidation.

01:05.499 --> 01:07.067
KYLE:
Roll again.

01:07.101 --> 01:10.771
Well, obviously they are
all virgins, so good work there.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.573
Thank you, Master.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.876
Shh! Guillermo!
You'll spook the virgins!

01:15.909 --> 01:17.678
Your accent!

01:19.079 --> 01:20.448
-I will join.
-One.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.882
-I will join.
-Two.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.151
Yes!

01:23.184 --> 01:24.785
SHANICE:
Jenelf has volunteered, sire.

01:24.818 --> 01:28.489
No. Jenelf has
but 23 hit points.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.491
-You still have enough points.
-All who agree Jenelf

01:30.524 --> 01:33.494
does not have enough points
to come on the quest, say "aye."

01:33.527 --> 01:34.795
Aye.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.497
OTHERS:
Aye.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.499
Why do they ignore
the little female one?

01:38.532 --> 01:40.501
Perhaps it is part
of their game.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.670
They pretend she's invisible?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.238
KYLE:
You call this
a sojourner's tavern?

01:44.272 --> 01:46.674
Your mead tastes
like griffin piss.

01:46.707 --> 01:47.975
(spits)

01:49.009 --> 01:50.444
I don't want these virgins.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.580
They are going to taste too sad.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.182
-Oh, come on.
-Let's just eat the mean one.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.983
No, I know what
you're bloody like.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.951
If you eat the mean one, you're
gonna be mean all evening.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.820
No, thank you.
This is a bowl of rotten fruit!

01:59.853 --> 02:02.656
All right, I think you need
to calm down, my beauty.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.992
-Coming?
-In a moment.

02:07.395 --> 02:08.996
-JONATHAN: Sorry, Jen.
-SHANICE: Sorry.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.101
Be strong, sweet little one.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.204
Someday they will all be dead,

02:16.237 --> 02:19.039
and you will do a shit
on all of their graves.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.808
("You're Dead"
by Norma Tanega playing)

02:22.476 --> 02:24.978
* Don't sing if you want
to live long *

02:25.012 --> 02:27.481
* They have no use
for your song *

02:27.515 --> 02:30.117
* You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead *

02:30.150 --> 02:32.520
* You're dead
and out of this world *

02:34.588 --> 02:37.625
* Now your hope and compassion
is gone *

02:37.658 --> 02:40.361
* You sold out your dream
to the world *

02:40.394 --> 02:42.696
* Stay dead, stay dead,
stay dead *

02:42.730 --> 02:44.832
* You're dead
and out of this world. *

02:54.942 --> 02:56.377
(ship horn blows)

02:56.410 --> 02:58.579
NANDOR: Recently,
we've had a very powerful

02:58.612 --> 03:02.250
and ancient vampire move
into the house, and it's

03:02.283 --> 03:03.884
made things a little...

03:03.917 --> 03:05.419
challenging.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.221
(roaring)

03:07.255 --> 03:09.423
The Baron has charged us
with the task

03:09.457 --> 03:12.025
of taking power
over the New World.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.495
He expected us to have conquered
the New World,

03:14.528 --> 03:16.530
but I don't remember him
ever mentioning it.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.098
NADJA:
I just remembered,

03:18.131 --> 03:20.501
the last time me and the Baron
were making love,

03:20.534 --> 03:22.903
he said something to me.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.606
"If you ever get
to the New World, my dear,

03:25.639 --> 03:28.041
"take over the land and
subjugate the entire population,

03:28.075 --> 03:29.777
otherwise I'll have your head."

03:29.810 --> 03:31.612
But I couldn't pay attention,

03:31.645 --> 03:34.682
because he was doing that thing
where he pays a lot of attention

03:34.715 --> 03:36.183
-to your area.
-His thing is,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.719
he's got this irritating habit
of giving you orders

03:38.752 --> 03:40.588
just at the moment of climax.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.056
So you're both there
in the moment, and then...

03:43.090 --> 03:45.593
he barks an order,
and you're, "Huh? What?"

03:45.626 --> 03:47.561
"Uh... what?"

03:47.595 --> 03:49.430
Nothing.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.731
"I beg your pardon?"

03:50.764 --> 03:52.300
(high-pitched);
"What are you saying?"

03:52.333 --> 03:54.302
And he never repeats
what he said.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.638
Expects you to have listened,
during the climax.

03:57.671 --> 04:01.108
So I guess we conquering
the New World now.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.313
Extend arm... and dust.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.047
Careful of the spider house.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.783
You wouldn't like it
if a spider came and dusted

04:09.817 --> 04:12.219
-your house,
would you, Guillermo?
-Guess not.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.754
(gasps)

04:13.787 --> 04:16.089
GUILLERMO:
The worst part about having

04:16.123 --> 04:18.659
the Baron stay with us
is the Baron's familiar.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.061
She's so... creepy.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.730
Oh!

04:22.763 --> 04:26.233
GUILLERMO:
She's got everyone on edge,
popping up behind doors,

04:26.266 --> 04:27.935
behind bushes.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.137
(whispering):
She can hear everything we say.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.939
Everything.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.077
She's worse than Guillermo.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.313
Always there.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.620
-Why the hell are we meeting
in the fancy...
-Shh!

04:46.654 --> 04:49.857
Why are we meeting in the fancy
room and not in the library?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.992
Because this is
a secret meeting.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.828
All secret meetings take place
in the fancy room.

04:54.862 --> 04:55.963
(curtains close)

05:00.701 --> 05:02.370
Do you want to pull the curtains
a little bit louder?

05:02.403 --> 05:03.437
It got stuck.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.439
-Sorry?
-It got stuck.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.640
(sighs)

05:06.674 --> 05:09.777
Now, the Baron's specific plan

05:09.810 --> 05:11.345
was that we are to conquer

05:11.379 --> 05:12.980
-North America.
-He actually said,

05:13.013 --> 05:16.283
-"the New World."
-No, he specified
Staten Island.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.552
No, the entirety
of North America.

05:18.586 --> 05:19.853
Then that would include Canada.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.689
What the fuck
would anyone want with Canada?

05:21.722 --> 05:24.358
Apparently, there is
a very active trade

05:24.392 --> 05:25.859
-in beaver pelts.
-Oh.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.395
That was hundreds
of years ago, Master.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.696
Guillermo, don't talk.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.297
Where was I? Yes.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.166
We need a plan
for total domination.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.537
We could poison the humans'
milks with witch's piss.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.407
-Uh, how would that work?
-We could assassinate the king.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.875
-We don't have a king
in America.
-Even easier.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.544
NADJA:
This is too much to ask.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.846
What a big bloody cheeky jerk,
coming here,

05:45.879 --> 05:47.748
telling us to take over
the whole of Staten Island

05:47.781 --> 05:50.584
just by ourselves,
while I bet he's having

05:50.618 --> 05:52.520
a lovely bloody nap up there!
I hope he's resting well!

05:52.553 --> 05:54.221
You want me
to come sing you a lullaby?!

05:54.254 --> 05:56.156
-Nadja, no.
-Silly boy.
-NANDOR: Nadja, don't...

05:56.189 --> 05:57.591
-don't raise your voice.
-LASZLO: That's very risky.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.259
-Woof!
-NANDOR: Shh! We are not alone

05:59.292 --> 06:01.261
in this house.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.096
Guillermo, check the curtain.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.699
Make sure she
is not eavesdropping on us.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.003
-Hello.
-(others groaning)

06:10.037 --> 06:12.172
COLIN:
I was just eavesdropping
behind the curtain there.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.541
Secret meeting, huh?

06:13.574 --> 06:15.175
-No.
-Uh-uh.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.710
What were you guys
talking about? Can I join?

06:16.744 --> 06:18.178
NADJA:
No. So sorry.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.047
We're planning your, um...

06:20.080 --> 06:22.416
-surprise party.
-NANDOR: Yeah.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.251
COLIN:
Oh. A surprise party, huh?

06:24.284 --> 06:25.453
OTHERS: Mm-hmm.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.888
Well, it's not much
of a surprise now, is it?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.624
You know,
if-if the fun part of the party

06:30.658 --> 06:33.260
is that it's a surprise,

06:33.293 --> 06:35.362
and you eliminate...

06:35.395 --> 06:37.865
all element of surprise,

06:37.898 --> 06:40.768
then it just becomes
a party, right?

06:40.801 --> 06:42.269
-Eh...
-So, tell me

06:42.302 --> 06:44.472
what's really going on,
because, frankly--

06:44.505 --> 06:46.406
let's be honest--
you've never even thought

06:46.440 --> 06:48.108
of throwing a party for me,

06:48.141 --> 06:50.744
-have you?
-NADJA: The Baron wants us

06:50.778 --> 06:52.613
to take over the land,

06:52.646 --> 06:55.816
-at least Staten Island.
-Well, it sounds like you want

06:55.849 --> 06:57.818
to talk to the local leaders.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.119
-Yeah.
-Yes.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.788
Okay, well,
I-I can help with that.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.790
-NANDOR: You can?
-I know exactly who you need

07:02.823 --> 07:04.792
-to talk to and where to go.
-NANDOR: Show us the way,

07:04.825 --> 07:06.326
Colin Robinson.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.662
Let our journey
to total domination

07:08.696 --> 07:11.364
begin this very evening!

07:15.469 --> 07:17.938
Perhaps you could just give us
the destination,

07:17.971 --> 07:20.774
and we could fly ahead and meet
you there, Colin Robinson.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.410
It's kind of hard to find.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.846
You know, I actually don't mind

07:25.879 --> 07:28.081
taking the bus.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.683
Everyone kind of focuses on

07:29.717 --> 07:33.020
the "day" part of "daywalker,"

07:33.053 --> 07:36.924
but actually, no one focuses
on the "walker" part.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.326
You know,
there's a lot of walking...

07:39.359 --> 07:41.128
Bat.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.700
They're never gonna be able
to find the place.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.636
COLIN:
Of course,
you can always have buses

07:48.669 --> 07:50.838
that are one-tier, two-tier,

07:50.871 --> 07:52.873
but you never see
three-tier buses.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.576
They would be hit
when they go under bridges.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.314
I appreciate, uh,
your perspective, Mr. Chapman,

08:01.348 --> 08:03.116
but the zoning ordinance...

08:03.150 --> 08:06.019
These are the ones who
rule over the local peasants?

08:06.053 --> 08:08.989
-Yes. Isn't this wonderful?
-No.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.190
Is it a wrestling pit?

08:10.223 --> 08:12.225
No. No. Just-just watch.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.528
-But when does
the wrestling start?
-Never.

08:14.562 --> 08:17.030
You're recognized, Mr. Peterson.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.966
Uh, according to the statute,
if Mr. Chapman's residence

08:18.999 --> 08:20.568
was originally zoned

08:20.601 --> 08:23.036
as a mixed-use or
multiple-dwelling structure...

08:23.070 --> 08:24.538
I come here every week.

08:24.572 --> 08:27.474
It's a smorgasbord of...
banality and despair.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.509
BARBARA:
Mr. Robinson? You're next up.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.979
-Is Mr. Robinson here?
-I'm just gonna do
a quick mega-feed,

08:32.012 --> 08:33.346
and then I'll be right back.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.015
BARBARA:
Mr. Robinson, are you here?

08:35.048 --> 08:37.484
I'm holding up a finger
indicating to hold on a second.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.752
Uh, I'll be right back.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.688
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:44.558 --> 08:47.327
(microphone feedback)

08:47.360 --> 08:49.429
(amplified creaking)

08:49.462 --> 08:52.399
COLIN:
Council. Uh, Madam President.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.234
When it comes
to zoning ordinances,

08:54.267 --> 08:56.436
I have a few thoughts.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.706
"Ordinance."
What does it mean?

08:58.739 --> 09:00.708
Webster's Unabridged Dictionary

09:00.741 --> 09:02.943
defines "ordinance"
as an "authoritative..."

09:02.976 --> 09:05.779
We will here demand our power.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.447
We have come up with a list
of all the things

09:07.480 --> 09:10.684
we would like to change
once the vampires are in charge.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.787
I'd like to see the construction
of a huge opaque dome

09:13.821 --> 09:16.289
the size of the city,

09:16.323 --> 09:20.427
covering the city,
and blocking out all sunlight.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.696
No noise during daylight hours.

09:22.730 --> 09:26.700
All local churches
to destroy their crucifixes.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.568
A total ban on turtlenecks.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.570
A vampire-only
television channel.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.139
I would like for me, personally,

09:32.172 --> 09:34.274
my favorite comedy,
Priests Falling Over.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.945
Free but compulsory
harpsichord concerts

09:37.978 --> 09:39.913
every day of the week.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.616
We would have nun-free zones
with a sign that says:

09:42.650 --> 09:46.553
"No Nuns. No Nuns. None."

09:46.586 --> 09:49.489
COLIN:
So, in closing,
hopefully next week,

09:49.522 --> 09:52.760
I can, uh, provide
a little bit more clarity,

09:52.793 --> 09:54.762
uh, as to the direction

09:54.795 --> 09:57.631
I feel like, uh,
our zoning laws should go.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.733
Thank you so much.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.102
BARBARA:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.971
Is Mr., uh,

10:04.004 --> 10:05.472
Nandor?

10:05.505 --> 10:07.140
Mr. Nandor?

10:07.174 --> 10:08.275
Yes.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.977
(quietly):
I got this.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.483
-Greetings, mortals.
-(microphone feedback)

10:16.516 --> 10:18.018
I will make this quick.

10:18.051 --> 10:21.488
I, Nandor the Relentless,

10:21.521 --> 10:23.824
conqueror of thousands,

10:23.857 --> 10:25.492
immortal warrior

10:25.525 --> 10:28.662
who has twice
turned the Euphrates itself

10:28.696 --> 10:30.497
red with blood,

10:30.530 --> 10:34.702
hereby demand the complete
and total supplication

10:34.735 --> 10:38.171
of this governing body
to my command!

10:39.206 --> 10:43.343
Submit and receive mercy.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.778
Resist...

10:44.812 --> 10:47.781
and only death awaits.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.717
(man coughs)

10:51.919 --> 10:55.555
Thank you for your input,
uh, Mr. Nandor...

10:55.588 --> 10:56.957
He's blown it.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.559
Hasn't even mentioned
the turtlenecks.

10:59.592 --> 11:00.994
...to zoning ordinances,

11:01.028 --> 11:03.563
but if you would like
to return...

11:03.596 --> 11:05.532
-Yes.
-when we have a...

11:05.565 --> 11:08.535
Yes, I would very much like
to-to return then.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.137
-When we have an open session,
-Great.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.739
you are entirely welcome
to join.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.974
Fantastic. Great.
When would that be?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.308
In about two months.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.145
But if you access our website--

11:18.178 --> 11:19.412
uh, do you have a computer?

11:19.446 --> 11:21.148
That will be the perfect time

11:21.181 --> 11:22.582
-for you to speak.
-Great. Fantastic.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.217
I live on Tanglewood,

11:24.251 --> 11:26.920
and the bar on the ground floor
below my apartment...

11:26.954 --> 11:29.656
LASZLO:
How best to describe Nandor?
I would say that

11:29.689 --> 11:32.826
he's blessedly unburdened
with the complications

11:32.860 --> 11:35.028
of a university education.

11:35.062 --> 11:38.398
But give him an ax,
and he's second to none.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.934
Though you wouldn't want him
as your barrister.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.702
Ha!

11:42.736 --> 11:44.938
Don't let him fucking see this.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.843
LASZLO:
So, their leader
is the Lazarro shrew?

11:49.877 --> 11:51.278
COLIN:
Correct.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.781
Where lies
Barbara Lazarro's weakest point?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.382
Oh, her Achilles' heel?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.717
So it's her foot?
Well, that's simple.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.720
-I know exactly what to do.
-I meant in Greek mythology,

12:00.754 --> 12:02.722
there's a human
who's held by his...

12:02.756 --> 12:04.624
Stop talking.
Who would you say

12:04.657 --> 12:07.427
is the most powerful member
of that group?

12:07.460 --> 12:08.962
Well, Ms. Lazarro.
But Doug Peterson

12:08.996 --> 12:11.631
is looking to unseat her
in the upcoming election.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.200
Some people think
he has a chance.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.068
-The streak of piss with a case?
-COLIN: Yeah.

12:15.102 --> 12:18.238
Shall we kill him as a warning?

12:18.271 --> 12:21.308
No. Let's use him as a pawn,

12:21.341 --> 12:24.044
but then I will visit
Barbara Lazarro

12:24.077 --> 12:26.780
-under cover of night.
-Yeah!

12:26.814 --> 12:27.815
(chuckling)

12:27.848 --> 12:29.616
Where's Nadja?

12:30.650 --> 12:32.619
(bat squeaking)

12:32.652 --> 12:34.487
Hello, cheeky little one.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.957
Out having some fun, are we?

12:36.990 --> 12:40.227
-Uh, not really.
-Oh, no.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.962
NADJA:
I remember how it feels

12:41.995 --> 12:43.831
to be powerless
and disrespected.

12:43.864 --> 12:47.067
Back home in my village,
I had many strikes against me.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.737
I was a woman, and I had Gypsy
blood, and we were so poor

12:50.770 --> 12:53.440
that we used to use
donkey dung for fuel,

12:53.473 --> 12:55.442
and when the donkey dung
ran out,

12:55.475 --> 12:57.811
we would have to burn
the donkey.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.413
So yes, I do know
what it feels like

13:00.447 --> 13:02.415
to be mocked and teased

13:02.449 --> 13:04.584
and to cry myself to sleep
at night

13:04.617 --> 13:07.087
by the light
of a burning donkey.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.956
Are those little dogshits
not giving you

13:08.989 --> 13:10.991
the deep respect you deserve?

13:11.024 --> 13:12.960
Yeah.

13:12.993 --> 13:16.964
Come. Let's walk and talk about
what the future could be like

13:16.997 --> 13:19.699
for the new Jenna.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.369
LASZLO:
Now, my plan is to win
the trust of Barbara Lazarro.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.636
Am I devious?

13:23.670 --> 13:25.372
Yes, I think I am.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.107
But as the old saying goes,

13:27.140 --> 13:29.676
I didn't come here
to make friends.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.144
That's bullshit.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.180
That's exactly
what I came here to do.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.983
-Uh, yes?
-Good evening, Madam Lazarro.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.618
My name is Laszlo Cravensworth.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.953
And who do we have here?

13:39.987 --> 13:42.189
Oh, I'm watching my little
granddaughter for the night.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.691
What a lovely little nibble
she would be.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.294
I'm sorry, do I know you?

13:47.327 --> 13:48.495
Well, you do now.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.530
And may I say
you are a credit

13:50.563 --> 13:52.832
to the women's
suffragette movement.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.969
And you're also
very easy on the eye.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.737
And I'm glad to see
your foot injury

13:57.770 --> 13:59.372
-isn't slowing you down.
-My what?

13:59.406 --> 14:00.507
Your foot.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.977
Now, I come to you
with a warning.

14:04.011 --> 14:07.180
Those who you trust
cannot be trusted.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.516
-But I am here
to help you with that.
-Now, if-if this is

14:09.549 --> 14:13.320
borough council-related,
I have regular office hours.

14:13.353 --> 14:17.524
If there is a stone,
so to speak, in your shoe

14:17.557 --> 14:20.227
that needs eliminating...

14:20.260 --> 14:23.263
I-I mean, the... the raccoon
population is out of control.

14:23.296 --> 14:27.034
Saw three of them in my
garbage can this morning. Three.

14:27.067 --> 14:30.770
-It's a nightmare.
-Really? I do like
a direct woman.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.908
You know, I...

14:34.942 --> 14:36.576
(baby fussing)

14:36.609 --> 14:39.179
I really do have
to get Emily here, um,

14:39.212 --> 14:40.914
bathed and washed.

14:40.948 --> 14:43.183
Uh, why don't you, uh,
call my office in the morning,

14:43.216 --> 14:45.452
and I'll... I'll try to see
if I can find someone

14:45.485 --> 14:48.288
who can help you with whatever
it is you need help with.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.757
It's not I who needs help,
it's you.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.926
So it's me who's ending
this conversation.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.894
Not you.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.396
And...

14:56.429 --> 14:59.266
you won't remember
a thing about it.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.401
And, you, my darling,
won't remember a thing

15:01.434 --> 15:04.037
about a damn thing.
(kisses)

15:04.071 --> 15:06.773
NANDOR:
Trying to ally
with Barbara Lazarro

15:06.806 --> 15:08.708
is a shit plan.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.978
The power move here

15:11.011 --> 15:15.748
is to make Doug Peterson
my personal agent of chaos.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.985
Peterson destroys Lazarro,

15:18.018 --> 15:21.054
Nandor destroys Peterson

15:21.088 --> 15:24.924
and the council... is mine.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.327
(bat squeaking)

15:28.928 --> 15:30.897
That's a nice little bitch
you've got there.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.599
Pardon me?

15:32.632 --> 15:34.401
A nice little bitch
being led on a leash

15:34.434 --> 15:36.003
by a frightened little man.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.771
It reminds me of how you
are led about on a leash

15:38.805 --> 15:41.841
by the human bitch
Barbara Lazarro.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.110
Look, I don't want
any trouble, okay?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.344
So just take my wallet.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.014
I'm not here to rob you,
little man.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.682
All right,
let's do it the fast way.

15:49.716 --> 15:53.153
Tonight before you drift
into a slumber,

15:53.186 --> 15:57.057
you will hear a voice
that will command your actions.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.526
Okay.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.960
Oh.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.896
Okay. Great.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.368
JENNA:
Is this like
a Tony Robbins, like,

16:08.401 --> 16:09.502
Unleash the Power Within thing?

16:09.536 --> 16:12.472
Unleash the power.
Yes, exactly. Yes.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.142
You're saying that would help me
sed-seduce men?

16:15.175 --> 16:17.044
And destroy them.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.979
-And women, too. (chuckles)
-Oh.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.381
Yeah, I-I should be honest.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.883
I have... I have a boyfriend,

16:23.916 --> 16:25.218
and we do s-stuff.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.554
I mean, we do stuff on camera

16:27.587 --> 16:30.690
because that's...
that's the stuff he likes,

16:30.723 --> 16:33.793
and that's the stuff
that he tells me I like.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.064
You know what? Just college is,
like, a really complicated time.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.800
This is college, right?

16:40.833 --> 16:44.371
Here I am, and this-this
beautiful older woman

16:44.404 --> 16:47.174
wants to take me
on a sexual journey.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.741
And, like, I...

16:48.775 --> 16:50.177
Are you a junior?
Are you a senior?

16:50.210 --> 16:51.378
I'm senior.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.180
-(chuckles)
-Oh. Okay.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.082
And you are just a fresh baby

16:55.115 --> 16:56.816
shot out of her mother's womb,

16:56.849 --> 16:58.385
glistening with light.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.588
Thank you.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.923
You're sure you want to do this?

17:03.956 --> 17:05.358
Um...

17:05.392 --> 17:07.360
I should be honest with you.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.396
I'm a virgin.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.733
Maybe we should just start

17:13.766 --> 17:15.902
-with mouth stuff,
if that's okay.
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.037
Just mouth stuff.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.407
(growls)

17:20.440 --> 17:23.410
Ow. Uh...

17:23.443 --> 17:24.944
Oh.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.380
Wowie zowie, that is...

17:27.414 --> 17:29.349
(muffled): Uh, shush, darling.
You don't need to talk.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.418
Oh, I'm sorry.
I always talk too much.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.186
Oh, ah!

17:33.220 --> 17:34.887
The Lazarro woman's
demanded proof

17:34.921 --> 17:37.023
of my ability as an ally,

17:37.056 --> 17:40.059
so, uh... here goes.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.296
Hello,
my little nighttime brother.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.332
Fuck me.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.301
Fucking thing just bit me.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.069
But that'll heal immediately.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.871
There we are.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.706
Seems I overestimated
our kinship.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.742
I'll have to take things up
a notch.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.079
(clarinet playing)

18:05.017 --> 18:07.654
(raccoons chittering)

18:13.593 --> 18:16.263
I call out to you

18:16.296 --> 18:18.631
through the ether,

18:18.665 --> 18:20.667
Doug...

18:22.635 --> 18:26.105
...Peters.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.074
Peters?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.810
Peterson.
Doug Peterson.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.413
I call out to you

18:33.446 --> 18:34.914
through the ether,

18:34.947 --> 18:38.751
Doug Peterson.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.019
(door opens)

18:40.052 --> 18:41.120
-D...
-GUILLERMO: Did you call me?

18:41.154 --> 18:42.455
What?

18:42.489 --> 18:44.657
-I just heard...
Did you call me?
-No.

18:44.691 --> 18:48.094
I was calling through the ether
to Doug Peterson.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.329
-You're not calling.
-No.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.331
If I need anything,
I will call you.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.099
But not through the ether.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.867
Just by regular yelling.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.969
-All right, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.172
Peterson.

19:00.707 --> 19:04.477
Doug Peterson.

19:05.178 --> 19:09.048
Doug Peterson.

19:09.081 --> 19:13.019
Do you hear me call you?

19:13.052 --> 19:15.522
I hear you.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.123
Great.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.426
Hi, Doug.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.497
Now, my sweet
little baby turkey...

19:24.531 --> 19:25.732
(chuckles)

19:25.765 --> 19:28.201
...I'd like you to drink
something from this vial.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.836
-Huh?
-Oh.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.305
Is it vodka or something?

19:32.339 --> 19:35.508
It's like a very strong spirit
with a little spicy kick.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.910
Um, it is my blood.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.882
Well, your blood is delicious.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.417
(chuckles)
Why do they call it blood?

19:44.451 --> 19:47.019
Well, it's...
it is the blood from my body,

19:47.053 --> 19:50.056
so I-I call it my blood.
(chuckles)

20:01.634 --> 20:03.603
(screams)

20:03.636 --> 20:07.006
I mean, w-we don't know
who was behind this.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.277
Is this a gang-related activity?

20:10.310 --> 20:13.613
Is-is MS-13 sending a message?

20:13.646 --> 20:16.082
I gave you those raccoons
as a bloody gift.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.084
BARBARA:
This was a clear
and direct threat

20:18.117 --> 20:19.886
to my well-being...

20:19.919 --> 20:21.954
NANDOR:
They laughed at me.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.524
They will not be laughing
now that I am about to unleash

20:24.557 --> 20:27.627
my hellhound Doug Peters...

20:27.660 --> 20:29.529
son.

20:29.562 --> 20:34.033
...and to the safety
of every member of this council.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.968
It's a grim portent
of things to come

20:36.002 --> 20:39.238
if we don't surrender,
you ignorant bitch.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.441
-(whispers): Yes, Doug Peterson.
-BARBARA: What?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.943
I will rip your head
from your body.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.112
And I will hang your entrails

20:46.145 --> 20:48.581
from the traffic light
on Hylan Boulevard

20:48.615 --> 20:50.249
so our new masters will see

20:50.283 --> 20:52.985
that only those who submit
will survive!

20:53.019 --> 20:55.455
Mr. Peterson,
you are way out of order.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.123
-(grunting)
-(Barbara gasps)

20:57.156 --> 20:59.125
Heed my vision
before it's too late!

20:59.158 --> 21:00.727
I have received a message

21:00.760 --> 21:03.330
from a slouching beast
in the night!

21:03.363 --> 21:05.365
(Doug grunting)

21:07.800 --> 21:10.136
-The man is quite obviously mad.
-DOUG: He spoke to me

21:10.169 --> 21:11.838
-through the ether!
-Or someone's driven him mad.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.475
Something terrible is coming!

21:15.508 --> 21:17.644
(screaming)

21:17.677 --> 21:19.178
-This is an embarrassment.
-DOUG: Unhand me,
you troglodyte!

21:19.211 --> 21:20.747
Well, I did not hear you peep up

21:20.780 --> 21:22.281
when we were coming up
with the new plan.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.850
I was making a new vampire.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.752
-Wait, I'm sorry, what?
-Nothing.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.920
Perhaps we should come up
with a new plan, then.

21:27.954 --> 21:31.591
DOUG:
Vengeance will be mine
when nightmares are made real!

21:31.624 --> 21:34.361
-Are you leaving with us?
-No. I-I can't stand up
right now,

21:34.394 --> 21:36.496
-if you know
what I mean. (chuckles)
-(groans)

21:36.529 --> 21:39.332
DOUG:
Tear the fucking veil of
illusion from your eyes!

21:39.366 --> 21:41.534
And witness the hellscape
that is our destiny!

21:41.568 --> 21:44.203
Wh-What was that
about a vampire?

21:44.236 --> 21:48.107
DOUG: I will tear your balls off
and feed them to your children!

21:48.140 --> 21:50.477
I, um...

21:50.510 --> 21:53.713
I've been fighting off
this very intense...

21:53.746 --> 21:56.816
flu, I think. I... Um,

21:56.849 --> 22:00.787
'cause I didn't have enough
layers on the other night.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.655
Think it's mono.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.391
Uh, no, I don't...

22:04.424 --> 22:06.125
think it's...

22:06.158 --> 22:07.326
(loudly retching)

22:13.099 --> 22:17.269
* No vampires
remain in Romania *

22:21.007 --> 22:24.811
* I am not
your Dracula spectacular *

22:24.844 --> 22:28.581
* This is not your weekend
in Vegas *

22:28.615 --> 22:32.519
* This is not
your selfie obscura *

22:32.552 --> 22:36.389
* I am not your tour guide
of Paris *

22:36.423 --> 22:40.059
* This is not
West Hollywood on Thursday *

22:40.092 --> 22:43.896
* I am not your object d'art *

22:43.930 --> 22:47.767
* I am not your sepia heyday *

22:47.800 --> 22:51.471
* This is not the moment
we part. *

23:01.280 --> 23:03.750
by the most beautiful woman
I had ever seen.

23:03.783 --> 23:06.919
She was clawing
at the glass.
I was hypnotized.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.320
I used hypnosis on him.
