SMITH: <i>In 1945, America's greatest generation
came back from war.</i>

00:47.040 --> 00:49.646
MAN 1: <i>The flags of freedom fly over Europe.</i>

00:51.320 --> 00:52.960
SMITH: <i>Nazi Germany had been defeated...</i>

00:53.000 --> 00:57.085
<i>...and three months later,
Imperial Japan surrendered as well.</i>

00:57.280 --> 00:59.647
MAN 2: <i>And there's jubilation around this earth.</i>

00:59.800 --> 01:04.169
SMITH: <i>Men returned home. Among them,
some of baseball's most beloved names.</i>

01:04.319 --> 01:07.449
<i>Musial. DiMaggio. Williams.</i>

01:07.600 --> 01:10.251
<i>Life in the United States
could return to normal.</i>

01:10.400 --> 01:12.289
<i>- What's the guy's name?
- What's on second?</i>

01:12.440 --> 01:13.840
<i>- Who's on second?
- Who's on first?</i>

01:13.960 --> 01:15.086
<i>- I don't know.
- Third base.</i>

01:15.240 --> 01:16.287
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:16.440 --> 01:19.683
SMITH: <i>And baseball was proof positive
that democracy was real.</i>

01:19.840 --> 01:22.650
<i>A baseball box score, after all,
is a democratic thing.</i>

01:22.800 --> 01:25.531
<i>It doesn't say how big you are
or what religion you follow.</i>

01:25.680 --> 01:28.365
<i>It does not know how you voted
or the color of your skin.</i>

01:28.560 --> 01:32.121
<i>It simply states what kind of ballplayer
you were on any particular day.</i>

01:32.320 --> 01:33.924
MAN 3: <i>And he did it. It's a home run.</i>

01:34.080 --> 01:35.923
<i>They knew he'd do it.</i>

01:36.080 --> 01:39.323
SMITH: <i>African Americans
had served their country gallantly.</i>

01:39.480 --> 01:42.529
<i>They returned home from fighting
to free the world from tyranny...</i>

01:42.680 --> 01:46.526
<i>...only to find racism, segregation
and Jim Crow law still waiting at home.</i>

01:46.680 --> 01:49.047
MAN 4: <i>Segregation was the law...</i>

01:49.200 --> 01:52.443
<i>...and no group was more scrupulous
in its observance of custom...</i>

01:52.600 --> 01:54.170
<i>...than organized baseball.</i>

01:54.320 --> 01:55.760
SMITH: <i>There was a long road ahead.</i>

01:59.520 --> 02:01.887
<i>If African Americans dreamed
of playing baseball...</i>

02:02.040 --> 02:03.690
<i>...it was not for the Yankees...</i>

02:03.840 --> 02:07.208
<i>...but for teams like the Kansas City
Monarchs of the Negro Leagues...</i>

02:07.360 --> 02:11.001
<i>...where the barnstorming style of play
stood in contrast to the Majors.</i>

02:11.440 --> 02:14.330
<i>In 1946, there were
16 Major League baseball teams...</i>

02:14.480 --> 02:17.882
<i>...with a total of 400 players
on their rosters.</i>

02:18.040 --> 02:20.691
<i>Every one of the 400 players
were white.</i>

02:20.840 --> 02:26.529
<i>But when opening day came in 1947,
that number dropped to 399...</i>

02:26.680 --> 02:28.603
<i>...and one man stood apart.</i>

RICKEY: Gentlemen, I have a plan.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.611
Plan's good, Mr. Rickey.
You always have one.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.445
RICKEY: My wife says I'm too old. Heh, heh.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.045
That my health's not up to it.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.121
My son says, uh, everybody in...

03:10.080 --> 03:14.290
Everybody in baseball
is gonna be against me. Heh.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.522
But I'm gonna do it.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.602
SUKEFORTH: Do what, Mr. Rickey?

03:22.440 --> 03:25.808
I'm gonna bring a Negro ballplayer...

03:26.800 --> 03:29.451
...to the Brooklyn Dodgers.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.125
With all due respect, sir,
have you lost your mind?

03:41.880 --> 03:44.406
Think... Think about...

03:45.960 --> 03:47.086
Think about the abuse...

03:47.240 --> 03:49.527
...that you are gonna take
from the newspapers...

03:49.680 --> 03:52.524
...let alone how this is gonna play out
in Flatbush!

03:53.080 --> 03:54.809
Please, Mr. Rickey.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.963
Sit down, Harold.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.491
No law against it, Clyde.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.965
No.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.801
No, but there's a code.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.527
You break a law and get away with it,
some people think you're smart.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.401
You break an unwritten law...

04:22.680 --> 04:25.001
...you'll be an outcast.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.201
Mm-hm.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.364
So be it.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.446
New York's full of Negro baseball fans.

04:36.160 --> 04:41.121
Dollars aren't black and white,
they're green.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.726
Every dollar's green.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.248
I don't know who he is...

04:48.040 --> 04:49.883
...or where he is...

04:51.720 --> 04:53.643
...but he's coming.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.727
(CROWD CHEERING)

04:57.400 --> 04:58.811
Hey, runner!

04:58.960 --> 05:02.169
Where'd you learn to move like that,
at a dime-a-dance night?

05:02.360 --> 05:03.850
Stand still!

05:04.000 --> 05:05.411

05:05.560 --> 05:06.721

JACKIE: Catcher!

05:13.680 --> 05:15.569
When you gonna start throwing for real?

05:15.720 --> 05:17.006
You talking to me?

05:17.160 --> 05:19.162
You got a rag arm, catcher.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.530
Steal home.
You'll find out what kind of arm I got.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.444
Okay.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.766
I'm coming.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.764
Where's your shortstop from?

05:28.920 --> 05:30.081
California.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.402
Sure got a mouth on him.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.168

<i>When this decision will be communicated

06:08.280 --> 06:10.647
- Fill her up?
- Yes, sir.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.451
MAN 1: You boys heading out?
MAN 2: Uh, Chicago.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.409
MAN 1: Chicago, huh? Heh.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.283
- You boys get around.
- Yeah, we sure do.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.563
- Hey. Hey, you, where you going?
JACKIE: - To the toilet.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.410
Hell, come on, boy.
You know you can't go in there.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.123
Them Cokes are a nickel.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.645
Take that hose out of the tank.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.484
- Robinson.
- What?

06:56.160 --> 06:57.969
I said take it out.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.685
We'll get our 99 gallons of gas
someplace else.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.525
All right, then. Go on.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.450
Go on! Use it.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.484
Roy Campanella.

07:26.640 --> 07:31.168
Hell of a player. He's too sweet.
They'd eat him alive.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.810
SUKEFORTH: All right.

07:32.960 --> 07:36.282
Oh, sorry. Oh, wait. Sorry.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.723
- Satchel Paige, then.
RICKEY: - He's too old.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.362
We need a player with a future,
not a past.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.925
Here.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.809
Jack Roosevelt Robinson.

07:48.640 --> 07:53.407
Four-sport college man, out of UCLA.
That means he's played with white boys.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.724
Playing for the Kansas City Monarchs.

07:56.880 --> 08:00.407
Twenty-six years old.
He's batting .350. Three-fifty.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.363
Methodist.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.851
Commissioned Army officer.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.371
He was court-martialed.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.090
SUKEFORTH: <i>He's a troublemaker.</i>

08:09.280 --> 08:11.567
<i>Well, he argues with umpires.</i>

08:11.760 --> 08:13.524
<i>A quick temper is his reputation.</i>

08:13.720 --> 08:15.600
PARROTT: <i>Well, what was he court-martialed for?</i>

08:15.720 --> 08:20.009
RICKEY: <i>Wouldn't sit in the back
of a military bus. Fort Hood, Texas.</i>

08:20.160 --> 08:23.084
Driver asked him to, uh, move back.

08:23.240 --> 08:24.651
(SCOFFS)

08:24.800 --> 08:26.768
MPs had to take him off.

08:27.720 --> 08:28.846
There, you see?

08:29.000 --> 08:32.163
I see he resents segregation.

08:34.320 --> 08:37.688
If he were white, we'd call that spirit.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.691
Robinson's a Methodist.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.763
I'm a Methodist. God's a Methodist.

08:43.960 --> 08:47.089
We can't go wrong. Find him.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.404
Bring him here.

08:49.560 --> 08:54.600
SUKEFORTH: How are you, fellas?
I'm looking for your, uh, shortstop.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.121
You Jackie Robinson?

09:05.720 --> 09:07.484
Who are you?

09:10.640 --> 09:11.926
JACKIE: <i>Mr. Rickey.</i>

09:12.760 --> 09:14.250
What's this about?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.606
This is about baseball, Jackie.

09:34.360 --> 09:38.684
I see you starting in spring
with our affiliate in Montreal.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.968
If you make it there...

09:43.640 --> 09:45.688
...we'll try you down here...

09:46.160 --> 09:47.241
...with the Dodgers.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.966
With the white Brooklyn Dodgers.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.531
(SCOFFS)

09:53.680 --> 09:55.523
Hmm.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.490
I'll pay you $600 a month.

09:59.200 --> 10:03.762
And a $3500 bonus
when you sign the contract.

10:03.920 --> 10:04.967
That agreeable?

10:06.440 --> 10:09.444
- Yes, that's fine but...
- There's one condition.

10:09.720 --> 10:13.770
I know you can hit behind the runner.
That you can read a pitch.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.327
One question is...

10:16.480 --> 10:18.528
...can you control your temper?

10:19.440 --> 10:20.487
My temper?

10:20.680 --> 10:22.967
Yes, your temper! What are you, deaf?

10:23.720 --> 10:28.726
A black man in white baseball, heh,
can you imagine the reaction?

10:28.880 --> 10:31.008
The vitriol?

10:33.640 --> 10:38.567
Dodgers check into a hotel,
a, uh, a decent, good hotel.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.041
You're worn out from the road.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.926
Some clerk won't give you the pen
to sign in with.

10:45.120 --> 10:49.682
"We got no room for you, boy. Not even
down in the coal bin where you belong."

10:49.840 --> 10:53.811
Team stops at a restaurant.
Waiter won't take your order.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.891
"Didn't you see the sign on the door?
No niggers allowed."

10:58.040 --> 11:01.840
What are you gonna do then?
Fight him? Ruin all my plans?

11:03.560 --> 11:06.040
Answer me, you black son of a bitch!

11:11.840 --> 11:14.605
You want a player who doesn't
have the guts to fight back?

11:16.360 --> 11:17.725
No.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.605
No.

11:21.480 --> 11:26.088
I want a player who's got the guts
not to fight back.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.767
People aren't gonna like this.

11:30.240 --> 11:34.040
They're gonna do anything
to get you to react.

11:34.200 --> 11:38.125
Echo a curse with a curse
and, uh, they'll hear only yours.

11:38.280 --> 11:42.968
Follow a blow with a blow and they'll say,
"The Negro lost his temper."

11:43.120 --> 11:46.169
That "The Negro does not belong."

11:46.320 --> 11:48.641
Your enemy will be out in force...

11:48.800 --> 11:52.247
...and you cannot meet him
on his own low ground.

11:52.720 --> 11:56.964
We win with hitting, running, fielding.
Only that.

11:57.120 --> 12:01.330
We win if the world is convinced
of two things:

12:01.480 --> 12:05.804
That you are a fine gentleman
and a great baseball player.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.527
Like our Savior...

12:13.080 --> 12:15.162
...you gotta have the guts...

12:15.760 --> 12:17.649
...to turn the other cheek.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.409
Can you do it?

12:36.840 --> 12:40.561
You give me a uniform...

12:42.600 --> 12:47.208
...you give me a, heh,
number on my back...

12:50.360 --> 12:52.362
...and I'll give you the guts.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.047

13:09.600 --> 13:11.841
Brooklyn? For what?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.729
Uh...

13:13.880 --> 13:16.804
I don't want to say on the phone.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.682
In fact, I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.565
What's going on? Aren't you supposed
to be playing in Chicago?

13:27.520 --> 13:30.683
We've been tested, you and me.

Jack, what are you talking about?
What is going on? What happened?

13:50.760 --> 13:52.410
Will you marry me, Rae?

13:56.400 --> 13:57.925
Absolutely.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.324

14:00.520 --> 14:01.931
Yes. Yes.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.607
When?

14:05.760 --> 14:07.524
Um...

14:07.680 --> 14:09.762
How about right now?

14:14.920 --> 14:17.048
Did my mom look happy?

14:17.880 --> 14:21.407
Yes. You know your mother loves me.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.282
Did my gram look happy?

14:24.640 --> 14:26.210
Yes.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.211
My brother look happy?

14:34.280 --> 14:36.328
- Heh, your brother?
- Ha, ha.

14:37.280 --> 14:41.968
Everyone looked happy. I've never seen
so many happy-looking people.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.688
Did Jack Robinson look happy?

14:51.800 --> 14:53.689
What if I can't make you happy?

14:55.080 --> 14:56.650
Too late.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.809
You already do.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.488
It's you and me, Rae.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.889
Ooh, ha, ha.

- Till the wheels fall off.
- Hmm.

15:16.320 --> 15:19.164
Oh, Jack, the world is waiting for us.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.767
The world can wait one more night.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.840
Are you coming, Mrs. Robinson?

15:29.120 --> 15:31.691
I'd follow you anywhere, Mr. Robinson.

15:32.280 --> 15:33.805
Okay.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.124
Okay.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.041
WOMAN: (ON PA)
<i>Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour.</i>

15:48.200 --> 15:50.521
<i>Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour.</i>

15:50.880 --> 15:55.761
"Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour.
Flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour."

15:57.520 --> 15:59.045
Are you okay?

16:00.520 --> 16:02.682
I've just never seen one before.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.405
JACKIE: Oh.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.690
Yeah, we're not in Pasadena anymore.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.885
Rae?

16:18.360 --> 16:19.407
Rae?

16:22.160 --> 16:23.730
Rae!

16:29.480 --> 16:31.642
Oh, boy.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.761
We have to lighten the plane.

16:38.520 --> 16:41.046
There's some bad weather east of here.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.931
A heavy plane is dangerous.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.568
So someone'll have to cancel.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.770
Look, I'm with the Brooklyn Dodger
organization.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.331
I have to get down to Daytona.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.086
I'm supposed to report to spring training
in the morning.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.887
WOMAN 1: We'll do our best to get you there
by tomorrow, but it might be the day after.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.287
- Jack.
WOMAN 2: - Right this way.

17:06.560 --> 17:07.766
You gave away our seats?

17:10.680 --> 17:12.887
You get us back on that plane.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.201
You get us back on that plane right now.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.923
Do you wanna call the sheriff...

17:20.359 --> 17:21.964
...or should I?

17:40.440 --> 17:41.771
MAN: Watch your step.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.287
Oop, there he is. There's my boy.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.125
Folks, stand back,
we'll get the bags out.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.647
Jackie Robinson.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.845
Wendell Smith.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.046
<i>Pittsburgh Courier.</i>

18:04.800 --> 18:05.926
A reporter?

18:07.720 --> 18:08.926
(CHUCKLES)

18:09.080 --> 18:12.846
Mr. Rickey sent me to meet you.
I'm gonna be your Boswell.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.041
My who?

18:15.200 --> 18:16.486
SMITH: Your chronicler.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.848
Your advance man.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.487
Hell, even your chauffeur.

18:21.640 --> 18:22.971
Mrs. Robinson.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.525
It's Rachel.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.327
Man, you two looked wiped out.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.521
You got a car?

18:30.680 --> 18:32.444
Uh-huh.

18:34.600 --> 18:39.367
SMITH: Brooklyn plays downtown.
Montreal just a few blocks from here.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.888
Joe and Duff Harris live here.

18:57.640 --> 19:01.406
He gets out the Negro vote.
He does a lot of good for colored people.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.161
Now, Mr. Rickey set it up himself.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.720
"If the Robinsons can't stay
at the hotels...

19:07.880 --> 19:10.963
...they should stay someplace
that represents something."

19:11.200 --> 19:14.010
You'll stay here all but a few days
at the end of the week...

19:14.160 --> 19:18.927
...when the Dodger organization goes
to Sanford. It's about 45 minutes away.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.646
You'll stay here, Rachel.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.844
This'll be your home
when Jackie has to travel.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.609
Uh, where are the other wives staying?

19:27.760 --> 19:30.001
Welcome to Daytona Beach.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.041
- There are no other wives.
WOMAN: - You must be Jackie.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.329
You're the only one that Mr. Rickey
allowed to spring training.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.446
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm. After you.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.601
MAN 1: Come on, now, skip.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.768
MAN 2: All right, here we go, boys!

19:47.360 --> 19:49.840
- I got it! I got it!
- I got it!

19:51.560 --> 19:52.971
That was a pretty big hop, there.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.360
- You got the hop!
- Ha, ha.

19:54.520 --> 19:58.286
Spring training.
It's where we work out our differences.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.645
DUROCHER: All right!

20:10.800 --> 20:13.963
You boys continue
to pretend you're ballplayers.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.648
- Morning, Leo.
- Good morning, Mr. Rickey.

20:17.560 --> 20:18.766
How are they doing?

20:18.920 --> 20:22.641
They're rusty, but we'll have them
oiled up in no time, ready to go.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.290
Oop.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.049
First day of spring training.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.851
Pittsburgh Courier readers need to know
how it feels.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.011
It's okay.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.082
That's not exactly a headline.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.370
It's all I got.

20:44.880 --> 20:49.488
Look, Jack, right now,
it's just me asking you.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.843
<i>But there's gonna be The New York Times
and the Sporting News.</i>

20:53.000 --> 20:56.322
- You should think about it.
- If they ask something, I'll answer it.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.124
Okay, well here's one for you:

20:58.280 --> 21:00.886
What if one of these white pitchers
throws at you?

21:04.840 --> 21:08.367
Look, they're gonna try to get under
your skin. You need to be ready.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.329
Listen, listen.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.091
You know...

21:13.240 --> 21:15.083
You know how when you're
at the plate...

21:15.240 --> 21:17.686
...you want to see the ball
come in slow?

21:18.160 --> 21:21.004
You want to see these questions
come in slow too.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.726
Hey, Jackie. Jackie, you think you can
make it with these white boys?

21:28.880 --> 21:33.966
Uh, I had no problems with white men
in the service or at UCLA.

21:34.120 --> 21:37.044
What you gonna do if one of these
pitchers throws at your head?

21:37.200 --> 21:38.725
Yeah, Jack.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.884
- I'll duck.
- Heh, that's a good one.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.042
MAN: Hey, Jack, what's your natural position?

21:47.360 --> 21:49.203
I've been playing shortstop.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.931
Are you after Pee Wee Reese's job?

21:52.120 --> 21:53.724
JACKIE: Uh...

21:53.880 --> 21:55.723
Reese plays for Brooklyn.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.969
I'm still trying to make Montreal.

21:58.120 --> 22:01.647
Hey, Jack.
Hey, Jack, is this about politics?

22:01.840 --> 22:03.046
It's about getting paid.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.249
MAN: "About getting paid." Hear what he
said? "it's about getting paid."

22:06.400 --> 22:07.526
He's gotta be kidding.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.808
Yeah. Good luck, Hop.

22:12.240 --> 22:15.130
Clay, Jackie Robinson.

22:15.280 --> 22:19.922
Jackie, I'd like you to meet Clay Hopper.
Manager of the Montreal Royals.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.481
Jack. They call me Hop.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.446
Now, we ain't doing much today.
Just tossing the ball around, hitting a few.

22:26.600 --> 22:30.002
You can probably toss with those fellows
over there.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.123
Jorgensen, come here!

22:40.760 --> 22:43.764
You're not playing him at shortstop,
huh, Clay?

22:43.960 --> 22:47.521
Oh, he's getting by on a quick release.
His arm's too weak for short.

22:47.680 --> 22:50.081
I think second base is his spot.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.411
I agree.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.725
Clay...

22:56.360 --> 23:01.002
...I need you to get the other players
to act like gentlemen around him.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.049
Treat him like they would
any other teammate.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.281
Hmm, mm-hm.

23:04.480 --> 23:08.087
- Be natural, work together in harmony.
- Mm-hm.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.131
That was practically superhuman.

23:21.280 --> 23:23.169
Heh, "superhuman"?

23:23.320 --> 23:25.402
I mean, don't get carried away,
Mr. Rickey.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.562
That's still a nigger out there.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.608
MAN 2: Nice job, boys!

23:40.200 --> 23:44.922
Clay, I realize that attitude
is part of your cultural heritage.

23:45.080 --> 23:49.688
That you practically nursed race prejudice
at your mother's breast...

23:49.840 --> 23:51.888
...so I'll let that go.

23:53.520 --> 23:56.330
But I will tell you this:

23:56.480 --> 24:01.168
You will either manage Robinson fairly
and correctly...

24:01.520 --> 24:04.649
...or you, sir, can be unemployed.

Yes, sir.

Yeah, well, the wife's inside cooking.

24:47.240 --> 24:50.210
You know what she asked me?
She asked me this morning:

24:50.720 --> 24:53.041
What do you serve when a hero's coming
to dinner?

24:53.200 --> 24:56.409
Heh, um, Mr. Brock, I'm just a ballplayer.

24:56.560 --> 24:57.721
Oh, no, no.

24:57.880 --> 25:01.851
You tell that to all the little colored boys

Welcome to opening day of the 1947
Brooklyn Dodgers season.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.767
As many of you know,
the Dodgers finished 96-60 last season.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.844
Respectable, but still two games
behind St. Louis...

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.571

the World Series.

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:00.169
<i>...what I mean to say is, he can toss
a lamb chop past a hungry wolf.</i>

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.846
<i>Oh, and it's a hard-hit ball down

usually goes to the runner but not this time.</i>

will remain to be seen.

uniform off two years ago...

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.484
...I promised the missus I'd never put
on another uniform again.

Roses and sleep
are two wonderful things, Burt.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:25.609

casket, and flowers look great on top of it.

to me, Burt.

What's this about, Branch?

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.246
I need you to manage the Dodgers
for me, Burt.

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:40.600
- No.
- Now, wait.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.004

You promised her you'd never
put on a uniform again.

I'm not prejudiced. It's physiological.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.368
Tar baby skin gonna melt.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.369
CROWD: Whoa!
MAN 3: You can't hit that?

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.363
MAN 4: One more! Strike him!

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.205
CHAPMAN: Why don't you get that boy
that you sent down...

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.408
...to the International League, huh?

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.523
That's where Africans play, ain't it?

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.011
Who was that?

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.924
Who'd you put out of a job, nigger?

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.249
Come on, Jackie.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.442
BARBER: <i>Robinson, waiting for the pitch.</i>

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.602
<i>Swings, and it's a fly ball out to left.</i>

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.362
<i>Ennis settles under it for the out.</i>

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.128
<i>Sky's starting to clear now,
the sun pushing its way through.</i>

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.726
Nigger can't play.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.927
It's all right, he can take it.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.291
God built him to last.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.648
BARBER: <i>No score, bottom of the 4th.</i>

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.644
<i>Spider Jorgensen
taking a small lead off first.</i>

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.644
Jorgensen, a rookie,
spent last season in Montreal.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.965
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:08.561
<i>And Stanky lines a single
out to right field.</i>

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.131
MAN 1: Three!

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.360
MAN 2: Hung low. Now there you go.
ANNOUNCER: (ON PA) <i>Next up for the Dodgers:</i>

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.127
<i>Jackie Robinson.</i>

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.286
CHAPMAN: Hey!

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.805
Hey, Pee Wee!

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.361
Hey, what's this nigger doing
for you all...

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.490
...that you let him drink out
of the same water fountain as you?

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.571
Huh?

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.123
I hope you don't take showers
with him.

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.611
Because you gonna be a mess!

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.166
Hey! nigger!

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.362
You like white women, huh?

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.002
Hey, which one of these Dodger wives
are you climbing on tonight?

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.281
UMPIRE: Time!

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.364
Wait, timeout, hold on.
He's gotta take a nap.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.521
Hey, which one is it?

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.964
I think I know!

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.641
Dixie?

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.201
(CHUCKLING)

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:01.046
Sorry. Dixie,
I hate to be the one to tell you.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.807
I saw her walking earlier
with a little bit of a bow in her step.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.446
It'll be fine.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.440
It'll be fine. He looks like a nice boy.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.369
That right, boy?

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.210
Come on, nigger, nigger, nigger!

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.929
BARBER: <i>Two men on for Robinson.</i>

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.363
<i>Here's the pitch from Leonard.</i>

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.922
<i>Swung on,
and it's a towering infield pop-up.</i>

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.446
<i>Seminick settles under it.</i>

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.201
- Hey, is that a home run?
MAN 3: - Yeah.

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.163
If you're playing in an elevator shaft.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.926
Can of corn, and Robinson is out.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.842
You don't belong here, nigger!

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.484
You hear me?
Why don't you look in the mirror?

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.768
This a white man's game.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.726
All right? Get that through
your thick monkey skull!

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.330
Look at me, baby.

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.010
(PANTING)

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.121
Look at me, baby. Look at me.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.690
(SCREAMING)

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.451
(SOBBING)

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.800
No!

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.450
No.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.640
The next white son of a bitch
that opens his mouth...

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.962
...I'll smash his goddamn teeth in.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.847
RICKEY: You can't do that, Jack.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.485
I'm supposed to just let this go on?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.571
RICKEY: These men have to live with themselves.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.325
I have to live with myself too.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.964
Right now I'm living a sermon out there.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.528
You don't matter now, Jack.

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.564
You're in this thing.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.008
You don't have the right to pull out
from the backing of people...

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.721
...that believe in you, that respect you,
that need you.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.166
Is that so?

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.604
If you fight, they won't say
that Chapman forced you to.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:36.402
They'll say that you're in over your head.
That you don't belong here.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.962
Do you know what it's like having
somebody do this to you?

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.281
No.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.366
No.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.411
You do.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.166
You're the one...

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.049
...living the sermon.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.284
In the wilderness.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.169
Forty days.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.691
All of it.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.411
Only you.

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:07.091
There's not a goddamn thing I can do
about it.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.770
Of course there is!

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:11.605
You can get out there and hit!

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.843
You can get on base and score.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.049
You can win this game for us.

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:20.485
We need you.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.688
Everybody needs you!

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.400
You're medicine, Jack!

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.241
MAN: Let's go, fellas.

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.090
They're taking the field.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.731
MAN: Now, get out there.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.041
Be smart, fellas.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.326
Let's go!

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.048
Who's playing first?

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.681
I'm gonna need a new bat.

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.843
BARBER: <i>Eight zeros on the scoreboard
for the Phi/lies, seven for the Dodgers.</i>

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.480
<i>No score,
with the bottom of the 8th coming up.</i>

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.085
CHAPMAN: All right, nigger.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.006
Hey, boy!

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.129
Porch monkey!

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.244
Hey, nigger, I know you can hear me.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.602
You know what you're here for,
don't you, huh?

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:51.004
You're here to get the nigger dollars
for Rickey at the gate.

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:55.403
You don't belong here, nigger!

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.325
Sit down.
You sit down or I sit you down.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.920
CHAPMAN: What's the problem, Stank?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.129
You're the problem, you disgrace.
What the hell kind of man are you?

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.808
You know he can't fight back. Why don't
you try picking on someone who can.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.361
I'm not gonna fight you,
get thrown out of the game.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.524
Stanky now having a chin-wag
with his ex-teammate Chapman.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.569
Both men, masters of distraction.

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:17.848
Stanky from second
and Chapman from the dugout.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.321
We'll have to wait and see
what the umpire does...

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:23.370
...since he's well within his rights
to kick Stanky out.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:27.684
Hey, 12! That's enough.
Back to the dugout.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.763
You shut your mouth or I shut it for you.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.610
This ain't happening.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.287
Hey, Stank? What's it like
being a nigger's nigger?

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:41.001
I don't know, Chapman. What's it
like to be a redneck piece of shit?

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.609
BARBER: <i>Robinson up.</i>

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.410

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:05.004
BARBER: <i>Not much of a hit to speak of,
but Jackie is standing on first.</i>

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.005
Go, Jackie.

ANNOUNCER: (ON PA)
<i>Center fielder, number 7, Pete Reiser.</i>

into the batter's box.</i>

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.929
Robinson with another big lead off first.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.560
He's just as restless
as a cat with a hot foot.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.081
MAN 2: Back.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.765
- Whoa!
- Safe!

(CROWD CHEERING)

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:33.209
BARBER: <i>The Flatbush faithful
voicing their approval of Jack...</i>

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.050
<i>...as this type of scrappy play...</i>

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.443
<i>...is exactly what they've grown
to expect of their beloved Bums.</i>

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.090
MAN 3: Play now.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.005
Work it.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.523
Steal it, sweetheart. Take it.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.043
- Strike three, you're out.
MAN 4: - He's going!

Come on!

BARBER: <i>Hermanski cracks a single to left...</i>

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.331
<i>...and Robinson is able to trot home
for the first run...</i>

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:45.165
<i>...that may also be the decider.</i>

Hey, Robinson!

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:14.847
Thanks.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.690
For what?

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.526
You're on my team.
What the hell am I supposed to do?

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:31.847
Nice hit.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.047
All this fuss over a rookie.

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:45.403
What, he's got 10, 12 at bats.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.846
Y'all gonna spoil him.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.128
Chapman,
do you think it cost you the game?

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.080
No. I think that a single out
to the left field cost us the game.

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:54.401
(CHUCKLES)

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.642
You think you were a little hard
on Robinson?

01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:00.441
No. Look, we treat him the same way
we treat Hank Greenberg...

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.126
...except we call him a kike
instead of a coon.

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:05.760
Whenever we play exhibitions
with the Yankees...

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.321
...we call Joe DiMaggio "The Wop."

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.448
All right? They laugh about it.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.047
And it's forgotten when the game's over.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.563
JACKIE: <i>I don't care if they like me.</i>

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.287
I didn't come here to make friends.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:37.209
I don't even care if they respect me.
I know who I am.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.171
Got enough respect for myself.

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.409
But I do not want them to beat me.

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.650
They're never gonna beat you.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:59.289
They came close today.

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.241
I'm going in that Phillies dugout
tomorrow...

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.482
...and I'm gonna wring
Ben Chapman's neck!

(LAUGHING)

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.608
Did I say something funny?

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.048
When I first told you about Robinson,
Harold...

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.170
...you were against it.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.482
Now, all of the sudden
you're worried about him.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.966
Wonder how that happened.

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:36.442
- Why, any decent-minded person would...
- Sympathy, Harold.

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:39.531
It's a Greek word. It means "to suffer."

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:43.127
"I sympathize with you"
means "I suffer with you."

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.451
That Philadelphia manager is, uh...

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:30.040
<i>...holding off all challengers.</i>

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:32.283
<i>During that time
and during this season...</i>

01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:35.046
<i>...I have watched Jackie Robinson
submerge himself...</i>

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.850
<i>...to serve something greater.</i>

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:41.769
<i>And I don't mean the Brooklyn Dodgers,
though he's doing that too.</i>

01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:45.763
<i>The man flat-out has guts.</i>

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:49.208
<i>A stand-up force of nature,
he's complicated everything but himself.</i>

01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:52.807
<i>He's changing the world
and refusing to let it change him.</i>

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.249
<i>But baseball isn't tennis.</i>

01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:58.169
<i>It takes a team.</i>

01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:01.487
<i>Joining together was a start.</i>

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:03.802
<i>Staying together, a big step forward.</i>

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:06.122
<i>But working together is how you win.</i>

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:07.560
Out!

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:09.210
(GROANS)

01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:11.328
Jackie, you son of a gun,
I could kiss you!

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:12.641
Nice catch.

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:14.290
Yours or mine? Heh.

01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:17.485
SMITH: <i>Down the stretch
on the last long road trip of the year...</i>

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:21.008
<i>...Jackie Robinson and the Brooklyn
Dodgers are doing exactly that.</i>

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:25.088
<i>They're holding off the Cardinals
and streaking towards the pennant.</i>

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:30.320
Boss, we did it.

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:32.721
We did it, we swept Cincinnati!

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.291
RICKEY: (OVER PHONE) <i>Great, Harold.</i>

01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.329
One more win could do it.

01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:38.528
Who's pitching tomorrow
for the Pirates?

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:41.330
Ostermueller.

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:46.003
BARBER: <i>Fritz Ostermueller on the mound.</i>

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.844
<i>He's 12-8 on the season.</i>

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.241
<i>A big game today in Pittsburgh.</i>

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:53.609
<i>A win and the Dodgers will have clinched
the National League pennant...</i>

01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:56.366
<i>...Yankees having already clinched
in the American League.</i>

01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:57.681
<i>There's bad blood here...</i>

01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:01.526
<i>...as Ostermueller beaned Robinson
in the head earlier in the season...</i>

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:04.251
<i>...prompting quite a rhubarb at the time.</i>

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:07.883
<i>Teams have gone
their separate ways since...</i>

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:10.520
<i>...with Ostermueller left standing
in the Dodgers' way...</i>

01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:13.291
<i>...as they chase the pennant
that eluded them last year.</i>

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.249
Come on, Jackie, let's go!

01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:20.760
BARBER: <i>Here comes the pitch.</i>

01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:23.368
<i>And Robinson takes outside. Ball one.</i>

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:26.928
- Come on, Fritz, let's get this boy!
- You don't belong here.

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:28.645
And you never will.

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:30.484
BARBER: <i>Robinson crowding the plate.</i>

01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:32.927
<i>Jack hasn't backed down
to a pitcher all season.</i>

01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:34.161
MAN: There you go, Jackie!

01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:38.564
You got nothing for him, Ostermueller!
But he's got something for you!

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.882
BARBER: <i>Ostermueller winds and throws.</i>

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:44.844
<i>Low and away, ball two.</i>

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:47.122
<i>Fritz seems
to be pitching around Jackie...</i>

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:50.250
<i>...or as they say in the trade,
trying to get him to chase.</i>

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:52.402
<i>Robinson's having
a fine rookie standard...</i>

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:55.643
<i>...batting .301 with 31 doubles
and 10 home runs.</i>

01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:58.929
<i>He has stolen 27 bases this season
and has yet to be thrown out attempting.</i>

01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:00.730
(OSTERMUELLER GRUNTS)

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:03.201
<i>Needless to say,
Ostermueller being careful with him.</i>

01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:06.969
BARBER: (OVER RADIO) <i>It's 3-0 now.</i>

01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:10.444
<i>Robinson patient,
waiting for something he can swing on.</i>

01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.445
Give me something.

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.405
Give me something I can hit.

01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:16.766
You want it?

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:18.490
What are you afraid of?

01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:30.129
What are you afraid of?

01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:33.969
BARBER: <i>Ostermueller looking in for the sign.</i>

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.771
Be careful what you ask for, boy.

01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:43.449
BARBER: <i>And here comes the pitch.</i>

01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:47.247
(CROWD CHEERING)

01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:49.602
<i>Oh, and that's a deep fly ball to left.</i>

01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:52.001
<i>Kiner on his horse,
I don't think he'll get there.</i>

01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:53.730
<i>Back, back, back, and...</i>

01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:56.360
<i>Oh, ho, ho, doctor!</i>

01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:58.648
<i>Robinson got his pitch!</i>

01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:00.040
<i>It's a home run.</i>

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:01.287
(CHEERING)

01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.771
<i>And barring a miracle comeback...</i>

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:05.810
<i>...the Dodgers are going
to the World Series!</i>

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.001
WOMAN: Yes!

01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:08.491
(ALL CHEERING)

01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:10.005
He did it, he did it!

(CROWD CHEERING)

01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.330
Pittsburgh!

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:28.367
Yes!

01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:30.364
Way to go, Jackie!

01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:36.728
BARBER: <i>Jack in his home run trot now,
and the home crowd here at Forbes...</i>

01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:39.486
<i>...recognizing something special
when they see it.</i>

01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:41.847
<i>All the same,
I can practically hear the roar...</i>

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.526
<i>...from the heart of Flatbush back
in Brooklyn.</i>

01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:22.405
WOMAN: Jackie, yeah, yeah!

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:26.531
Robinson rounds third...

...headed for home...

01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:35.442
...sweet home.
