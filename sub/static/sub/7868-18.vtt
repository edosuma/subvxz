{\pos(192,210)}I can't believe you're making us go
to a {\birthday}party

01:47.651 --> 01:49.035
{\pos(192,210)}for a kid we don't{\even} know.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.767
{\pos(192,210)}You remember Dylan.

01:50.892 --> 01:52.778
{\pos(192,210)}You were in Toddle Tots together.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.905
I don't{\even} remember if Dylan's a boy.{\or a girl.}

01:55.073 --> 01:56.517
{\pos(192,210)}Of course you do.

01:56.642 --> 01:57.742
{\pos(192,210)}Dylan's a...

01:59.131 --> 02:00.661
{\pos(192,210)}Let me check the invitation.

02:01.166 --> 02:02.322
Fish theme?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.508
That tells me nothing!

02:07.341 --> 02:09.252
{\pos(192,210)}There's got to be
a clue here somewhere.

02:11.528 --> 02:13.924
See? Dylan's clearly a gir...

02:19.119 --> 02:21.777
{\pos(192,210)}What kind of party
has two activities?

02:21.902 --> 02:23.684
{\pos(192,210)}They're just trying to confuse me.

02:24.024 --> 02:26.687
{\pos(192,210)}Look, everyone,
Dylan's best friend is here.

02:30.683 --> 02:31.692
I give up!

02:32.029 --> 02:34.014
{\pos(192,210)}I hope Dylan likes trucks.

{\pos(192,210)}You don't know Battle Balls?

03:04.038 --> 03:06.799
{\pos(192,210)}It's a Japanese card game
based on a cartoon

03:06.924 --> 03:09.897
{\pos(192,210)}based on an ancient religion
based on a candy bar.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.316
It makes Digimon look like Pokemon.

What? Impossible!

03:29.766 --> 03:31.902
"No food allowed in bank"?

03:32.027 --> 03:34.234
Better lie low, my sweet red friend.

until he gets what he wants.

{\pos(192,210)}And he wants $1 million
in unmarked bills!

03:51.772 --> 03:53.190
{\pos(192,210)}That would be nice.

04:00.836 --> 04:02.225
It's just a candy apple.

04:03.827 --> 04:07.329
{\pos(192,210)}- {\Clearly he's saying}He wants to be tasered again.
- Get him deep in the meat.

{\pos(192,210)}Community service?

04:19.505 --> 04:21.093
{\pos(192,210)}But... that's work.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.101
What about jail?
- Community service.

04:24.226 --> 04:25.472
I wanna go to jail.

I'll serve anything
but the community.

04:33.648 --> 04:37.154
{\So,}Sweetie, this community service detail
should end around 5:00.

04:37.279 --> 04:39.111
{\pos(192,210)}You want to go
to that seafood place?

04:40.026 --> 04:41.616
{\pos(192,210)}You got your book club again.

04:41.741 --> 04:44.158
{\pos(192,210)}Man, that thing sure meets a lot.

04:44.283 --> 04:47.217
{\pos(192,210)}You know, I've read that book.
Maybe I could come and...

04:47.342 --> 04:49.640
{\pos(192,210)}Right, not enough chairs.

04:51.149 --> 04:53.261
I'll probably be asleep
in front of the fridge

04:53.386 --> 04:55.114
when you get home. Bye.

04:57.707 --> 04:59.757
The community service detail.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.026
You people make me sick.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.969
Whatcha packing, Simpson?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.137
{\Just }My lunch.

05:05.587 --> 05:08.641
Chicken parm, meatball parm,
eggplant parm,

05:08.809 --> 05:11.875
shish ka-parm, angel food parm,
moo goo gai parm.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.098
{\pos(192,180)}My wife can parm anything.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.143
{\pos(192,210)}My wife only parms on my birthday.

05:17.268 --> 05:20.152
And that's only if I give her
the sad puppy dog look.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.675
Want a bite?
- Really? You mean it?

05:28.861 --> 05:31.317
Criminals, here's your assignments.

05:31.442 --> 05:34.672
Brockman, you get the used condoms
out of that thorn bush.

05:34.797 --> 05:38.314
Krustofsky, go sort those bums
by the war they were in.

05:39.089 --> 05:42.074
And, Simpson, you sit down
at this picnic table here

05:42.199 --> 05:43.634
and grab a bite with me.

05:43.802 --> 05:47.074
Teacher's pet.
- Find your nose, funny man.

05:47.199 --> 05:48.999
There was cocaine in there.

05:49.124 --> 05:51.016
I won't last an hour.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.607
Do you ever wear your police pants
to regular things?

05:58.775 --> 06:00.723
Throw a jean jacket on top
of these babies,

06:00.848 --> 06:02.209
and you can go anywhere.

06:02.334 --> 06:05.030
From fast food to fine dining?

06:05.198 --> 06:07.116
And everything in between.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.195
Ever stop breathing
when you're asleep?

06:10.559 --> 06:11.787
All the time.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.039
They say it's 'cause I'm overweight.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.041
Overweight? You?
No, that's crazy.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.977
Now, me, I have to get
my underwear specially made

06:20.102 --> 06:21.922
by this village in the Ukraine.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.093
They call me "Daddy Round-Round."

06:24.218 --> 06:26.105
Send me a Christmas card every year.

06:26.230 --> 06:27.928
That's some big underwear.

06:28.096 --> 06:31.056
My underpants paid
for their water filtration system.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.641
That's it for today.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.399
Simpson, hold on a sec.

06:35.265 --> 06:36.327
You wanna...

06:37.075 --> 06:38.239
I don't know...

06:38.364 --> 06:39.831
get a beer sometime?

06:39.956 --> 06:41.442
Ever been to Moe's?

06:41.949 --> 06:45.208
Earth to Homer,
I arrested you there last month.

06:46.596 --> 06:48.323
Sorry I was such a jerk about it.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.854
Who could blame you?
Your sports team lost.

06:52.365 --> 06:53.848
I'll see you at Moe's.

06:53.973 --> 06:56.508
I'm there every day, 5:00 to 11:00.

06:59.417 --> 07:02.755
Calling all units,
Chief Wiggum just made a friend.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.786
He's not my friend.

07:04.911 --> 07:08.427
He's just a non violent perp
I'm gonna pound a few beers with.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.262
Is he looking at me right now?

07:11.377 --> 07:13.015
Don't be so obvious.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.100
Let's all look
without looking, okay?

07:19.189 --> 07:21.273
God, he likes me!
Officer up.

07:22.012 --> 07:24.528
Officer way, way up.{\pub}

07:29.806 --> 07:31.106
This is so awesome.

07:31.231 --> 07:34.078
I can't believe I'm having breakfast
where the cops do.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.675
And you can feel good
about eating here, too.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.137
Because all the cooks are ex-cons
getting a second chance.

07:50.035 --> 07:53.430
Dang. I lost track of time.
I'm gonna be late for work.

07:54.555 --> 07:55.933
No, you won't.
Follow me.

08:00.004 --> 08:02.314
So this is what it feels
like to be a pregnant lady.

08:06.113 --> 08:08.662
Think you got
all the best Battle Ball cards?

08:08.787 --> 08:10.650
Stink again, smell-wad.

08:10.775 --> 08:13.492
Ralph Wiggum's
got a platinum lava genie.

08:15.319 --> 08:18.038
How'd a pull-up like you
get a great card like that?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.833
My not-dead grandma
sent it from Tokyo.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.186
Ralph, I will play you
for that card?

08:23.868 --> 08:26.821
But if I win, you have to teach me
how to play this game.

08:26.946 --> 08:27.946
Deal.

08:29.418 --> 08:31.692
Sir, I think something's going down.

08:31.817 --> 08:32.970
Something big.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.972
Could that be some sort
of narcotics transaction?

08:36.140 --> 08:37.640
What are you asking me for?

08:41.313 --> 08:43.147
I see you're impressed by my costume

08:43.272 --> 08:45.593
to the school's annual
drug-awareness assembly.

08:46.730 --> 08:48.485
So am I getting a raise or not?

08:51.948 --> 08:54.408
Hand me my coffee.
- Want some sugar?

08:54.685 --> 08:55.835
No, I got it.

09:02.404 --> 09:03.883
Impressive.

09:04.923 --> 09:08.755
{\Would it be okay if}- Can I ran a make on myself?
- Go ahead.

09:12.403 --> 09:15.846
Drunk and disorderly?
That's a little redundant.

09:16.903 --> 09:19.587
Mind if I do
a little spring cleaning?

09:19.712 --> 09:21.687
Tell you what,
I'll look the other way

09:21.812 --> 09:24.605
while you press "control-F3."

09:25.494 --> 09:27.399
You put yourself on AMBER Alert.

09:29.027 --> 09:30.300
My God!

09:31.613 --> 09:32.728
There he is!

09:32.853 --> 09:34.406
Okay, that's better.

09:36.961 --> 09:39.319
Not a good time
to be carrying this cake.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.325
Listen, Homer,
would you like to see my...

09:43.450 --> 09:45.209
my favorite place
in the whole world?

09:45.377 --> 09:47.127
Really? Me?

09:47.744 --> 09:50.188
Homer, I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.

09:50.313 --> 09:52.072
Cops don't have many friends.

09:52.197 --> 09:53.753
Civilians are scared of us,

09:53.878 --> 09:57.161
and other cops remind us of things
we want to forget.

09:57.286 --> 10:00.724
That's why our friendship is...
so special to me.

10:01.048 --> 10:03.477
Chief... me, too.

10:04.322 --> 10:07.063
I've been back here
for, like, ten hours.

10:07.188 --> 10:10.306
Any chance of a bathroom break?
- Thanks a lot, jailbird.

10:10.431 --> 10:12.903
Now I've got you on burglary
and killing a moment.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.514
Mrs. Simpson,

10:15.639 --> 10:19.076
Bart has always been
what we educators term a no-goodnik.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.496
But lately his behavior
has taken a more sinister turn.

10:23.304 --> 10:26.750
We have reason to believe
your son has been dealing drugs.

10:27.859 --> 10:29.593
Dealing drugs?

10:29.718 --> 10:31.281
That's impossible.

10:32.046 --> 10:34.007
He doesn't have the math skills.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.261
I know you've tried everything
to keep Bart under control...

10:37.429 --> 10:39.471
Ritalin, Lithium, Zoloft.

10:39.596 --> 10:40.786
They didn't work.

10:40.911 --> 10:42.849
He has moved on to drugs.

10:47.763 --> 10:48.772
Are you here?

10:52.436 --> 10:54.889
You really know
how to roll 'em, Bart.

10:55.644 --> 10:57.214
That's drug talk.

10:57.484 --> 10:59.177
But I could be mistaken.

10:59.302 --> 11:02.369
Let me just listen to a little more
out of context.

11:02.537 --> 11:05.789
This product is unbelievable.
- It's imported, you know.

11:12.915 --> 11:15.201
You ever worry
the sun's not gonna come back

11:15.326 --> 11:17.134
after it goes down at night?

11:18.327 --> 11:19.386
Me, neither.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.710
But you know who does?
Ralphie.

11:21.835 --> 11:23.509
Got a lot of worries, that kid.

11:23.634 --> 11:25.324
What if the bed wets him?

11:25.449 --> 11:27.811
What if Superman
decided to kill everybody?

11:29.610 --> 11:30.956
Ralph's a good kid.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.346
And he should be.

11:32.471 --> 11:33.984
He's got a great dad.

11:36.119 --> 11:38.238
You always know
the perfect thing to say.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.360
<i>Chief, it's Lou.</i>

11:43.032 --> 11:44.153
What is it now?

11:44.278 --> 11:46.246
<i>They're shooting at us.
We need backup.</i>

11:46.414 --> 11:48.847
You need backup, or you want backup?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.270
<i>We got a 2-11 in progress.</i>

11:51.798 --> 11:54.246
What have I told you
about not using the numbers?

11:54.599 --> 11:56.550
<i>It's an armed robbery, damn it.</i>

11:58.421 --> 12:00.003
I guess we should go.

12:04.697 --> 12:07.017
Can I cuff him?
- Sure. Why not?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.602
Chief, he's not trained.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.520
Who are you, the rules police?

12:11.127 --> 12:12.606
We are the police police.

12:13.072 --> 12:15.859
Nobody moves,
or the doughboy gets popped.

12:17.278 --> 12:20.113
Take your hands off my brother
from another mother.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.784
Get out of here!

12:23.952 --> 12:25.185
Not to worry.

12:25.310 --> 12:27.722
That's what bulletproof
vests are for.{\pub}

12:37.549 --> 12:39.589
{\$SPRINGFIELD
GENERAL HOSPITAL}

12:43.263 --> 12:44.429
Is he gonna be okay?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.073
It's gonna be touch and go.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.716
His left lung was filled
with shamrock shake.

12:48.841 --> 12:51.019
McDonald's didn't even
sell them, this year.

12:55.036 --> 12:56.091
Don't worry.

12:56.216 --> 12:59.512
Clancy was there for me,
and I'll be there for him.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.226
{\$GET WELL
DADDY ROUND-ROUND}

13:27.724 --> 13:29.798
Don't die on me, Clancy.

13:31.158 --> 13:34.002
You said our friendship was special.

13:35.339 --> 13:37.341
If it was so special,

13:37.874 --> 13:41.148
wake up, you fat sack of...

13:45.481 --> 13:47.075
What happened to me?

13:47.243 --> 13:48.538
You saved my life.

13:48.663 --> 13:51.746
And I came here every day
to make sure you pulled through.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.708
Thanks, Homer.
You're a true friend.

13:55.349 --> 13:56.718
Unlike that Lou.

13:56.843 --> 13:58.086
You're too late.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.255
I've been sleeping on that couch
for a week.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.037
You missed the wakeup.
That's all that counts.

14:05.384 --> 14:07.620
I haven't seen my family in days.

14:07.745 --> 14:09.554
Would you mind if I went home now?

14:09.679 --> 14:12.017
Now? But I just woke up.

14:13.049 --> 14:14.811
If you really want me to stay...

14:14.979 --> 14:16.764
You do what you have to do.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.940
Live your life... which I saved.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.197
Fine. I'll stay a little more.

14:21.322 --> 14:22.322
Great.

14:22.643 --> 14:25.414
Can you read me a story...
that you write yourself?

14:25.539 --> 14:27.587
It should be about
an imaginary meeting

14:27.712 --> 14:29.297
between Babe Ruth and Hitler.

14:29.422 --> 14:31.875
But make no mention
of baseball or Germany.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.150
And... begin.

15:08.331 --> 15:10.867
Awesome.
You finally made my room cool.

15:12.822 --> 15:14.454
Are you a drug-o?

15:14.622 --> 15:16.155
What? No.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.999
Not until you raise my allowance.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.536
Explain to me what you were doing
in the basement with Milhouse.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.613
Getting higher and higher...

15:24.249 --> 15:25.882
... scores on Battle Ball.

15:32.238 --> 15:33.848
That's pretty nifty.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.095
Let me try.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.021
My gosh, that's adorable.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.023
This one's going
on the Christmas tree.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.300
It's no fun if my Mom likes 'em.

15:46.383 --> 15:47.458
Come on, toilet.

15:47.583 --> 15:50.031
If you can handle Dad,
you can handle this.

15:50.644 --> 15:52.534
Where you been the last few weeks?

15:52.702 --> 15:55.287
Playing nursemaid to Chief Wiggum.

15:55.577 --> 15:58.520
People who get shot in the chest
are such big babies.

16:01.381 --> 16:03.980
That is so much better
than hospital beer.

16:07.101 --> 16:09.892
<i>So this is
the St. Elmo's Fire reunion</i>

16:10.017 --> 16:13.096
that Andrew McCarthy himself
was going to attend.

16:13.651 --> 16:16.092
Maybe I lied,
but you've been so needy.

16:16.217 --> 16:19.978
"I'm hungry","I'm itchy",
"That's not my blood type".

16:22.235 --> 16:23.902
What have we here?

16:24.942 --> 16:26.651
"World's worst friend."

16:26.819 --> 16:28.320
Man, you planted that!

16:28.488 --> 16:30.889
It's your word
against the Chief of police.

16:31.014 --> 16:32.684
Take him away, boys.

16:32.809 --> 16:35.452
Chief, being a bad friend
isn't against the law.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.829
If it was,
he'd be getting the chair.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.596
You all would!

16:39.721 --> 16:41.506
Bad friend!

16:52.637 --> 16:53.678
Who gave me up?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.076
Guess what, Silkie.

16:55.201 --> 16:57.974
It was your own mother.
- How does that feel?

16:58.142 --> 16:59.467
You both jive.

16:59.592 --> 17:02.287
You hear me?
You both jive.

17:08.279 --> 17:10.852
Everything reminds me of Clancy.

17:11.792 --> 17:14.156
You mugs'll never
take me alive, see.

17:19.025 --> 17:20.064
Everything.

17:20.189 --> 17:22.374
Homer, you have visitors.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.303
We haven't seen the Chief in days,

17:24.428 --> 17:26.836
we're starting to worry.
- Any idea where he might be?

17:27.003 --> 17:29.554
I have an idea, but I must go alone.

17:30.836 --> 17:34.508
My car is filled with printer paper
I stole from work.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.224
Chief.

17:39.623 --> 17:42.811
I brought a 32-piece chicken bucket.

17:44.091 --> 17:47.155
Just like you to forget
that I might want some.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.235
Come on.
Stitch those alligators.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.071
We got to get those knockoff
Lacoste shirts to the mall

17:53.239 --> 17:55.491
in time for the crazy days
of summer sale.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.616
Freeze.

17:57.743 --> 17:58.821
Careful, boys.

17:58.946 --> 18:00.456
Looks like his weapon's loaded

18:00.581 --> 18:03.373
with 12 original herbs and spices.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.095
You're jive.
Do you hear me?

18:08.220 --> 18:09.421
You're all jive.

18:17.255 --> 18:18.409
I'm sorry, Homer.

18:18.674 --> 18:21.800
If I hadn't have been so needy,
we wouldn't be in this trunk.

18:22.421 --> 18:25.270
I was kind of ungrateful.
You did save my life.

18:25.569 --> 18:27.676
Well, at least we got
to be friends again,

18:27.801 --> 18:29.790
you know, before we got whacked.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.736
We're not gonna get whacked.

18:32.904 --> 18:36.281
Because you're Chief Wiggum,
and you'll figure a way out of this.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.241
You have that much faith in me?

18:38.409 --> 18:41.455
No. Faith is what you have
in things that don't exist.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.413
Your awesomeness is real.

18:59.103 --> 19:02.015
Louie, how about some ominous music?

19:02.183 --> 19:06.048
It will make our drive
to the body dumpery most cinematic.

19:06.785 --> 19:08.040
You got it, boss.

19:13.356 --> 19:16.716
This sounds like
your Folk Divas mix.

19:19.265 --> 19:22.271
I'm gonna slap some sense
into that CD changer.

19:22.396 --> 19:23.723
Eat Fix-A-Flat.

19:30.063 --> 19:33.413
That was a tire iron
poking me in the back.

19:34.457 --> 19:36.007
That clears up a lot.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.610
Attention all units.

19:40.735 --> 19:44.086
The Chief and Homer have moved
into a new phase in their friendship.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.670
The flame will burn
less brightly perhaps,

19:46.795 --> 19:49.437
but this time, may last much longer.

19:49.769 --> 19:51.106
Well said, Lou.

19:52.067 --> 19:55.443
You wanna take out the police copter
and hassle people with the spotlight?

19:55.611 --> 19:57.946
I know just the guy.

20:00.156 --> 20:02.033
Flanders. Wake up.

20:02.201 --> 20:06.037
Take off your clothes
and prepare to be raptured.

20:06.516 --> 20:07.997
Okily dokily.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.183
Now, shave off your moustache

20:10.308 --> 20:13.024
and drink the hairs
in a cup of cocoa.

20:13.149 --> 20:14.128
Hot cocoa?

20:14.296 --> 20:16.546
No, ice cold.
