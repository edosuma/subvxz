00:47.768 --> 00:52.000
There are some things
in this world so frightening,

00:52.072 --> 00:54.267
that we pretend
they don't exist.

00:54.341 --> 00:57.208
Stuff of nightmares.

00:57.277 --> 00:59.643
We tell ourselves,

00:59.713 --> 01:01.874
"There's no such thing."

01:01.948 --> 01:03.848
But the truth is,

01:03.917 --> 01:05.111
they're out there...

01:08.054 --> 01:09.646
...even closer than we fear.

03:12.312 --> 03:13.574
Silver bullets.

03:18.685 --> 03:19.879
Nice touch.

03:25.525 --> 03:26.856
So, caretaker.

03:29.729 --> 03:31.924
Looks like you're out of a job.

03:34.668 --> 03:35.828
You and your people

03:35.902 --> 03:38.530
have been defending
these pathetic creatures

03:38.605 --> 03:40.436
for a long time.

03:40.507 --> 03:43.840
But it'll all be over soon enough.

03:49.282 --> 03:52.615
We'll attack each of these camps

03:52.686 --> 03:54.017
and destroy them.

03:55.555 --> 03:58.991
And this disgrace to our true nature
will be over forever.

04:00.994 --> 04:02.256
So, what was on the tape?

04:02.329 --> 04:04.456
You'll never find the boy
in time.

04:08.935 --> 04:10.300
No.

04:11.671 --> 04:12.933
It can't be.

04:13.006 --> 04:14.633
It's already begun.

04:16.743 --> 04:17.801
The legend is true.

04:21.781 --> 04:23.009
Where's the boy?

04:23.083 --> 04:24.345
Tell me!

04:24.417 --> 04:25.884
Not in this lifetime.

04:33.493 --> 04:35.154
Hurry. Gather your men.

04:35.228 --> 04:37.560
We have four days till full moon.

04:37.630 --> 04:39.257
Take this to Varek. He goes north.

04:39.332 --> 04:40.765
Tell him there's no time to lose.

04:40.834 --> 04:42.995
You find this boy
or it's the end of us.

04:48.842 --> 04:50.400
You can see for yourself.

04:50.477 --> 04:51.842
The boy is safe.

04:51.911 --> 04:53.742
But with the red moon,

04:53.813 --> 04:55.781
we should be ready for anything.

04:55.849 --> 04:57.749
Just to make sure.

04:57.817 --> 04:59.409
And you be careful.

04:59.486 --> 05:02.478
The red moon's powers
will be very strong.

05:02.555 --> 05:04.455
And you'll have to lock down
till this is over.

05:06.926 --> 05:08.393
I gotta go.

05:08.461 --> 05:10.361
Good luck. Stay sharp.

05:12.866 --> 05:14.026
He's gonna make it.

05:15.869 --> 05:17.029
We all are.

05:18.138 --> 05:19.662
This isn't a dream anymore.

05:21.174 --> 05:23.574
Four more days.

05:24.811 --> 05:26.301
Well, that's the good news.

05:26.379 --> 05:29.109
Bad news is now you all
gotta spend the night downstairs.

06:41.221 --> 06:42.483
It's probably just a fuse.

06:42.555 --> 06:43.681
I'll be right back.

07:47.487 --> 07:48.476
Ralph?

08:08.374 --> 08:09.363
Ralph?

08:25.725 --> 08:27.215
Oh, my God.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.232
Tell me when, Varek,

08:36.302 --> 08:37.633
and they're all dead.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.011
So it's true?

08:47.080 --> 08:48.411
The boy's alive.

08:49.749 --> 08:50.841
Where is he?

08:52.285 --> 08:53.616
Don't hurt him!

08:53.686 --> 08:55.347
That's not what I want.

08:55.421 --> 08:56.786
If you cooperate with us,

08:56.856 --> 08:59.120
then you will be spared,
along with your husband.

09:00.693 --> 09:01.921
If you choose otherwise,

09:01.995 --> 09:04.896
then you will be forced
to watch him suffer in agony,

09:04.964 --> 09:06.625
allowing you one last
look at the life

09:06.699 --> 09:08.064
that you elected to end.

09:08.134 --> 09:09.396
Do you understand?

09:17.910 --> 09:18.899
Good.

09:19.712 --> 09:20.701
Now...

09:21.547 --> 09:23.014
where's the child?

09:25.451 --> 09:26.782
We don't know.

09:27.954 --> 09:29.182
We never have.

09:29.255 --> 09:30.517
She's lyin'.

09:30.590 --> 09:31.921
They gotta know, Varek.

09:31.991 --> 09:34.391
You think we hadn't thought
of something like this?

09:36.162 --> 09:37.254
Of someone like you?

09:40.099 --> 09:41.566
You think you're a martyr.

09:43.236 --> 09:45.170
You might as well
be holding the blade.

09:55.915 --> 09:58.076
No! No! No!

10:08.728 --> 10:09.717
That's it?

10:11.264 --> 10:12.424
You believe her?

10:13.333 --> 10:15.198
It doesn't make any sense.
It's not possible, Varek.

10:15.268 --> 10:16.496
It makes perfect sense.

10:17.537 --> 10:18.868
They can't tell us
what they don't know,

10:18.938 --> 10:20.269
no matter what we do to them.

10:21.507 --> 10:22.496
It's foolproof.

10:22.575 --> 10:24.406
They're dying for some kid
they've never even seen?

10:24.477 --> 10:25.671
They have faith.

10:27.180 --> 10:28.306
It's all they need.

10:28.381 --> 10:31.350
Think of something.
This kid is out there.

10:33.286 --> 10:35.652
I'd rather die than
go back to that.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.917
We'll find the child.

10:37.990 --> 10:39.321
There is no alternative.

10:42.195 --> 10:43.526
We'll find him, Sonja.

10:50.837 --> 10:52.429
You can't even see the kid's face.

10:53.506 --> 10:54.837
So that's how they did it.

10:56.109 --> 10:57.974
Boosted morale
without risking a thing.

10:59.412 --> 11:00.743
We're wasting our time, Varek.

11:00.813 --> 11:02.974
We only have four more nights
to find this kid.

11:04.784 --> 11:05.773
Zo.

11:07.720 --> 11:08.709
Wait.

11:11.824 --> 11:13.086
You see that?

11:13.159 --> 11:15.059
- What?
- Right there.

11:16.562 --> 11:17.722
Look at the mirror.

11:25.505 --> 11:27.405
Huguenot.

11:28.841 --> 11:30.866
Come on, baby, breathe.

11:30.943 --> 11:32.274
Please, just breathe.

11:38.117 --> 11:39.584
Will, he can't breathe.

11:39.652 --> 11:42.587
I gave him his shot this morning.
I don't understand.

11:42.655 --> 11:44.384
His inhaler doesn't help!

11:44.457 --> 11:46.391
He just keeps getting
worse and worse.

11:46.459 --> 11:47.721
Rachel.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.056
It's gonna be okay.

11:50.663 --> 11:53.598
Tim, I want you to breathe deep...

11:55.101 --> 11:56.728
...and don't move.

11:56.803 --> 11:57.963
Come on, sweetie.

12:11.150 --> 12:12.139
Thank you.

12:14.353 --> 12:17.254
Man, this stuff smells like crap.

12:19.325 --> 12:20.383
Yeah.

12:42.381 --> 12:43.746
Hey, baby.

12:43.816 --> 12:45.340
You okay?

12:47.253 --> 12:49.221
You want to see something freaky?

12:55.995 --> 12:57.360
Isn't that awesome?

13:07.340 --> 13:09.035
Did you have another bad dream?

13:10.476 --> 13:11.636
No, I'm fine.

13:17.550 --> 13:19.245
Oh, come here, you.

13:19.318 --> 13:20.979
Let's snuggle.

13:23.389 --> 13:24.651
I love you, Mom.

13:24.724 --> 13:26.055
I love you, too, baby.

14:04.030 --> 14:05.793
Everything all right?

14:05.865 --> 14:07.890
I was worried when
you weren't there this morning.

14:07.967 --> 14:09.093
Tim had another attack.

14:09.168 --> 14:10.362
A bad one.

14:10.436 --> 14:11.562
He's all right now.
He's sleeping.

14:11.637 --> 14:13.798
So is Rachel. She was up
most of the night.

14:16.175 --> 14:17.164
The, um...

14:18.411 --> 14:22.370
The moon... is
getting very powerful.

14:22.448 --> 14:23.779
This may get worse.

14:23.849 --> 14:25.783
Well, thank God for you, Will.

14:25.851 --> 14:27.113
You've always been there for us.

14:27.186 --> 14:28.585
I don't know what we'd
do without you.

14:28.654 --> 14:30.315
It's all in a day's work.

14:40.333 --> 14:41.322
Hey.

14:44.136 --> 14:45.569
Tim looks well.

14:47.073 --> 14:48.062
Yeah.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.040
He gets sick
and he gets better.

14:50.109 --> 14:51.440
It's his whole life.

14:53.379 --> 14:55.472
He comforts me.

14:55.548 --> 14:56.537
Jonas.

14:59.085 --> 15:00.552
What's wrong, Rachel?

15:02.188 --> 15:04.156
There's something
I have to tell you.

15:05.725 --> 15:07.716
It's time for me and Tim to leave.

15:07.793 --> 15:10.353
We have to.

15:10.429 --> 15:11.828
I have to learn to be a mother.

15:11.897 --> 15:14.127
A good mother.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.328
Figure out what I want to do
with the rest of my life.

15:17.403 --> 15:20.201
You guys have raised Tim.
I haven't.

15:20.272 --> 15:23.673
I'm so goddamned dependent
on everyone here.

15:23.743 --> 15:26.769
I have to learn to stand
on my own two feet.

15:26.846 --> 15:29.906
He's been dead
over 13 years now, Jonas.

15:29.982 --> 15:32.143
What progress have I made?

15:32.218 --> 15:33.515
His ghost is all around me,

15:33.586 --> 15:36.646
every time I look
at you, Nana, Katherine.

15:38.524 --> 15:39.786
I still see him.

15:39.859 --> 15:41.451
Come on, Rachel.
Don't fool yourself.

15:41.527 --> 15:45.861
My brother's ghost is gonna be
with you wherever you go.

15:45.931 --> 15:47.660
So you need to be strong

15:47.733 --> 15:49.325
despite that.

15:49.402 --> 15:50.562
He'd want you to.

15:52.004 --> 15:53.266
I'm sorry, Jonas.

15:55.608 --> 15:57.007
I've already made my decision.

15:59.378 --> 16:00.538
Hey, Doak!

16:03.916 --> 16:04.905
Okay.

16:08.020 --> 16:09.419
What up, dog?

16:09.488 --> 16:12.616
You know.
Gotta give 'em what they want.

16:12.692 --> 16:14.182
What's that, D?

16:14.260 --> 16:16.125
I don't know. Let me see
what I got in here.

16:17.196 --> 16:20.461
- Uh, oh. New DVD.
- Yes!

16:23.636 --> 16:24.967
- Morning.
- Morning.

16:25.037 --> 16:26.470
- Good morning, Rachel.
- Hi, Mom.

16:26.539 --> 16:28.439
What's everyone doing here?
Did I miss something?

16:28.507 --> 16:29.769
- Mail.
- Muffins.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.239
Oh, you're forgetting your nametag.

16:35.114 --> 16:36.445
- Oh, shoot.
- Here.

16:37.850 --> 16:38.874
Thanks, Nana.

16:38.951 --> 16:40.509
Come on, Kat. Let's go hang.

16:40.586 --> 16:41.712
Totally.

16:42.988 --> 16:44.319
Be cool, fool.

16:47.426 --> 16:49.121
Ooh! Aw, shoot.

16:51.263 --> 16:53.060
This piece of track keeps catching.

16:53.132 --> 16:55.896
Uh, when did we start
wielding blades?

16:55.968 --> 16:57.458
Oh, a few days ago.

16:58.471 --> 16:59.529
What?

16:59.605 --> 17:01.072
Mom gave it to me.

17:01.140 --> 17:02.903
- All right.
- She was saving it for my birthday.

17:02.975 --> 17:05.000
I caught her trying
to hide it in her jewelry box.

17:06.512 --> 17:08.207
- So I got it early.
- Nice.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.577
Let me see that.

17:09.647 --> 17:10.637
Oh, sure.

17:11.916 --> 17:13.781
It looks so, uh, used.

17:15.488 --> 17:16.785
It was my dad's.

17:19.023 --> 17:22.016
Hey, look what
the cat dragged in.

17:22.728 --> 17:23.922
- Hey, Adam.
- Baby.

17:24.864 --> 17:25.887
Hey, babe.

17:30.402 --> 17:31.562
How you feelin', big guy?

17:31.637 --> 17:32.661
I'm hungry.

17:32.738 --> 17:34.103
All right. He said it.

17:34.173 --> 17:35.697
Let's go get some breakfast.

17:36.642 --> 17:38.667
- Easy.
- Why does he have to do that?

17:40.079 --> 17:42.775
Hey. Heard you had
a bit of a scare last night.

17:42.848 --> 17:44.315
How do you feel?

17:44.383 --> 17:46.408
Huge. Check that out.

17:46.485 --> 17:47.816
Check this out.

17:47.887 --> 17:49.149
Thanks, Uncle Jonas.

17:49.221 --> 17:50.483
Early birthday present.

17:50.556 --> 17:52.524
Wow, Dad. Is that a smile?

17:53.559 --> 17:55.117
Adam taking care of you?

17:56.929 --> 17:57.987
Come on.

18:00.466 --> 18:02.593
How about that moon last night?

18:02.668 --> 18:04.829
It was pretty wild, huh?

18:04.904 --> 18:06.633
Shoot. I'm late.

18:06.705 --> 18:08.297
So, you'll drop Timmy at the store?

18:08.374 --> 18:09.466
We'll be there.

18:30.496 --> 18:31.622
Wave to Courtney.

18:34.967 --> 18:36.832
Hey, Adam! Rachel!

18:38.003 --> 18:39.300
How's Tim?

18:39.371 --> 18:40.633
All better?

18:40.706 --> 18:42.936
He's fine. Thanks.

18:44.009 --> 18:45.306
Good news.

18:51.984 --> 18:54.418
Tim had an attack last night.

18:54.486 --> 18:55.748
Last night.

18:55.821 --> 18:57.584
We can't even sneeze in this town

18:57.656 --> 18:59.749
without anyone knowing our business.

18:59.825 --> 19:01.156
Isn't that weird?

19:01.227 --> 19:03.593
I mean, it's not normal. It's not.

22:09.615 --> 22:11.014
We're not here right now.

22:11.083 --> 22:12.880
Leave a message and we'll
get right back to you.

22:12.951 --> 22:14.384
Thanks.

22:14.453 --> 22:15.920
Hey, guys, it's me.

22:15.988 --> 22:17.216
Where are you?

22:17.289 --> 22:18.654
I thought you'd be here by now.

22:18.724 --> 22:21.022
It's getting late. Um...

22:21.093 --> 22:22.424
Where are you?

22:25.764 --> 22:27.527
Nana?

22:27.599 --> 22:29.533
Do you think the moon
will be red again tonight?

22:31.670 --> 22:32.694
Yeah, maybe.

22:34.006 --> 22:35.530
Really?
What makes it red?

22:35.607 --> 22:38.132
It's getting late.
Let's just get you to the store.

22:54.827 --> 22:55.885
Nana?

23:21.453 --> 23:22.442
Come on.

23:41.940 --> 23:43.339
All we want is the boy.

23:58.123 --> 23:59.181
Did you hear guns?

24:18.043 --> 24:19.340
Nana, stay down!

24:30.455 --> 24:33.549
I'll explain later. Right now,
learn how to load a gun.

24:35.861 --> 24:37.158
Adam, what are you doing?

24:37.229 --> 24:38.457
We need to move now.

24:39.598 --> 24:40.587
Timothy!

24:59.484 --> 25:00.473
Quick! Get down!

25:10.462 --> 25:11.451
Dad!

25:17.236 --> 25:18.669
Head straight for the saddle shop.

25:18.870 --> 25:20.497
Stay there until I come for you.

25:20.572 --> 25:22.267
I'm not leaving you, Nana.

25:22.341 --> 25:23.399
Do as I say.

25:24.209 --> 25:25.198
Go!

25:44.663 --> 25:45.755
Go! Get the boy!

26:05.517 --> 26:06.779
Mom!

26:06.852 --> 26:08.410
Oh, my God.

26:08.487 --> 26:09.545
Are you okay?

26:38.784 --> 26:40.251
Don't move until I tell you.

26:45.090 --> 26:46.079
Now we need...

26:50.362 --> 26:51.795
...to get to my garage.

26:56.234 --> 26:57.223
Trust me.

27:19.157 --> 27:20.146
Adam.

27:21.093 --> 27:22.355
They're on us.

27:22.427 --> 27:23.758
Where's Jonas?

27:28.934 --> 27:30.196
Go. Let's move!

27:30.268 --> 27:31.895
Come on! Come on!

27:32.904 --> 27:34.201
Come on.

27:34.272 --> 27:35.534
Give me your hand.

27:35.607 --> 27:36.631
Give me your hand, Rachel.

27:37.576 --> 27:38.565
Come on!

27:59.965 --> 28:01.330
Adam, get her in the truck!

28:01.400 --> 28:02.332
Give me your hand!

28:04.636 --> 28:05.466
Mom!

28:05.537 --> 28:06.799
Get out of here!

28:20.752 --> 28:21.810
I can't believe...

28:21.887 --> 28:22.979
Anyone else hit?

28:23.422 --> 28:24.616
Get the bandages.

28:25.257 --> 28:26.246
Okay.

28:30.195 --> 28:31.560
Wait, let me see this.

28:31.630 --> 28:32.756
Put some pressure.
Put pressure.

28:49.448 --> 28:51.712
Nana! It's Nana!

28:51.783 --> 28:53.808
How did they find us,
Jonas? How?

28:53.885 --> 28:55.216
What the hell is happening?

28:56.121 --> 28:57.588
They want Timothy.

28:57.656 --> 28:58.918
What are you talking about?

28:58.990 --> 29:00.753
They want to kill him, Rachel.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.919
And they're not gonna
stop until he's dead.

29:02.994 --> 29:05.394
Why would anyone want
to kill Tim? He's just a boy.

29:05.464 --> 29:06.726
In three days,

29:06.798 --> 29:08.322
on a full moon,

29:08.400 --> 29:10.265
something's gonna
happen to Timothy.

29:10.335 --> 29:12.326
Something they can't allow.

29:17.476 --> 29:19.376
I'll find them.

29:19.444 --> 29:20.741
You know that.

29:20.879 --> 29:23.143
You're not making any sense.

29:23.215 --> 29:24.944
We're cursed.

29:26.618 --> 29:28.279
We kept you in the dark
all these years

29:28.353 --> 29:29.718
because it was the best way
to prevent them

29:29.788 --> 29:31.813
from finding Timothy... ever.

29:31.890 --> 29:33.755
And we kept him safe, Rachel.

29:33.825 --> 29:36.191
For 13 years, we kept him safe.

29:36.261 --> 29:37.250
Don't.

29:47.172 --> 29:48.867
We call ourselves Skinwalkers.

29:51.443 --> 29:52.876
I don't understand.

29:52.944 --> 29:54.343
You would call us werewolves.

29:54.412 --> 29:55.970
Who were they?

29:56.047 --> 29:57.514
Skinwalkers.

29:58.717 --> 30:00.082
But not like us.

30:02.420 --> 30:04.354
It's really quite simple.

30:04.422 --> 30:06.720
We want the curse to end.
They don't.

30:06.791 --> 30:08.622
Why do they want me?

30:08.693 --> 30:10.126
'Cause you're the only one

30:10.195 --> 30:14.131
who has the power to end
the curse forever.

30:14.199 --> 30:15.598
You're special, Timothy.

30:15.667 --> 30:18.500
You have your mother's blood

30:18.570 --> 30:20.128
and ours.

30:20.205 --> 30:21.263
Nana was one of us.

30:21.339 --> 30:22.863
So was your father.

30:22.941 --> 30:24.169
No.

30:24.242 --> 30:25.732
That's impossible. Not my husband.

30:25.810 --> 30:27.175
Pull this thing over.
We're getting out.

30:27.245 --> 30:28.473
- Rachel, please!
- Don't you get it?

30:28.547 --> 30:30.640
I don't believe you.
You're no better...

30:31.516 --> 30:32.847
Mom!

30:32.918 --> 30:34.180
It's gonna be okay.

30:34.252 --> 30:35.241
I promise.

31:31.276 --> 31:32.903
Don't worry. She's safe.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.037
They're locked down.

31:35.113 --> 31:36.842
She needs to see it to believe it.

31:38.583 --> 31:39.948
You're not like them.

31:40.018 --> 31:41.645
I'm just a friend.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.745
I knew your father
when he was your age,

31:43.822 --> 31:45.881
and Jonas and I go way back.

31:45.957 --> 31:47.891
My people have been taking
care of these people

31:47.959 --> 31:50.018
for a long time.

31:50.095 --> 31:51.357
There's a legend,

31:51.429 --> 31:52.691
a belief,

31:52.764 --> 31:54.026
that if a child who's...

31:54.099 --> 31:55.293
A half breed?

31:56.835 --> 31:58.564
Something like that.

31:58.637 --> 32:00.696
And if he lives to be 13 years old,

32:00.772 --> 32:02.034
there's gonna be a red moon,

32:02.107 --> 32:04.132
which is a signal to all Skinwalkers

32:04.209 --> 32:07.201
that the prophecy will
be fulfilled at midnight

32:07.278 --> 32:09.678
on the day of your 13th birthday.

32:11.282 --> 32:14.251
When they turn, the craving
for human blood is so intense,

32:14.319 --> 32:16.310
that if they break free and feed,

32:16.388 --> 32:18.219
they will become the beast forever.

32:20.325 --> 32:21.792
The ones trying to kill me,

32:21.860 --> 32:23.122
they don't want the curse to end?

32:23.194 --> 32:24.821
To them, it's not a curse.

32:25.830 --> 32:28.264
The lust and desire
to consume human blood

32:28.333 --> 32:30.358
is so overwhelming for them,

32:30.435 --> 32:32.369
it's like drugs to an addict.

32:40.945 --> 32:43.038
The first Skinwalkers
were Native American.

32:43.114 --> 32:45.241
They believed that the power
of the wolf was a gift,

32:45.316 --> 32:47.944
but it mutated and...

32:48.019 --> 32:50.146
many couldn't control
the lust for power,

32:50.221 --> 32:53.122
couldn't fight the beast
inside them.

32:53.191 --> 32:54.818
What makes you think I can?

32:57.062 --> 32:58.359
If I live through this,

32:58.430 --> 33:01.092
what is it that I'm supposed
to be able to do exactly?

33:03.268 --> 33:04.257
I don't know.

34:26.150 --> 34:27.550
Jonas.

34:47.572 --> 34:49.096
Here you go, little girl.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.607
- Thanks, LJ.
- Anytime.

34:53.077 --> 34:54.873
I'll take your money.
How much was it, anyway?

34:57.148 --> 34:58.513
Come to Daddy, baby.

34:58.583 --> 34:59.845
Keep dreaming.

34:59.918 --> 35:01.613
- Yeah.
- Hey.

35:03.688 --> 35:05.280
So, are we gonna play some pool?

35:05.356 --> 35:06.345
Let's play, baby.

35:06.424 --> 35:07.413
Oh, yeah.
We're gonna play, all right.

35:07.492 --> 35:09.084
Hey! Get your hands off me!

35:09.160 --> 35:10.388
How about two against one?

35:10.461 --> 35:12.895
- No!
- Party now. Yeah!

35:12.964 --> 35:15.899
Get off me! Get off of me!

35:20.738 --> 35:23.036
Hey, sweetheart.
You want some of this?

35:28.980 --> 35:30.004
What the...

37:51.389 --> 37:52.617
Please forgive us.

38:03.835 --> 38:05.063
We're refueled.

38:06.471 --> 38:08.200
I'm gonna head for the stronghold.

38:09.207 --> 38:10.196
All right.

38:50.481 --> 38:52.039
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

38:53.351 --> 38:55.148
You know, you might even
like it if you try it.

38:56.754 --> 38:58.619
Not in this lifetime.

39:13.071 --> 39:14.629
Where the hell
are we gonna go?

39:15.873 --> 39:17.067
Follow the leader.

39:20.278 --> 39:21.711
Zo.

39:21.779 --> 39:23.178
Yeah?

39:23.247 --> 39:24.441
Let's get it done.

39:51.309 --> 39:53.072
I'm the same man, Rachel.

39:53.878 --> 39:54.936
No.

39:56.714 --> 39:58.011
You're not.

39:58.082 --> 39:59.606
Not to me.

39:59.684 --> 40:01.982
You've been living like
this your whole life?

40:02.053 --> 40:03.486
Every month?

40:04.489 --> 40:05.751
What about them?

40:05.823 --> 40:06.881
The ones coming after us.

40:06.958 --> 40:07.947
When they change, do they...

40:08.025 --> 40:10.687
They hunt and they kill.

40:10.761 --> 40:11.989
They're addicted to blood.

40:12.063 --> 40:14.122
Once you feed, you can't go back.

40:14.198 --> 40:15.563
Those beasts killed my husband

40:15.633 --> 40:17.100
and now they're after my son?

40:18.870 --> 40:21.395
How is a 13-year-old boy
gonna end all of this?

40:21.472 --> 40:23.235
He's special.

40:25.943 --> 40:27.604
The nightmares, the asthma...

40:28.446 --> 40:29.708
Timothy...

40:29.780 --> 40:32.340
Timothy's body is at war with itself.

40:32.416 --> 40:34.043
And he needs you.

40:34.118 --> 40:35.779
We need you.

40:36.621 --> 40:37.713
So, what now?

40:39.924 --> 40:41.892
How do we keep my son safe?

40:41.959 --> 40:45.554
Now we keep together,
and we stay out of sight.

40:47.031 --> 40:48.521
Now there's just two more days.

40:48.599 --> 40:50.533
We're so close, Rachel.

40:54.739 --> 40:56.297
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:57.508 --> 40:58.839
What is it, baby?

40:58.910 --> 41:00.241
Mom, I...

41:00.311 --> 41:02.836
I don't feel so good.

41:09.620 --> 41:12.453
It's okay, baby. I'm here.

41:12.523 --> 41:14.218
It's gonna be okay, Tim.

41:14.292 --> 41:15.919
What happened?

41:15.993 --> 41:17.358
You passed out.

41:18.529 --> 41:20.588
You'll be back
in the game in no time.

41:20.665 --> 41:21.654
You'll be good.

41:26.304 --> 41:27.703
So when you get the nurse...

41:29.974 --> 41:31.339
...I want you to do a walk around.

41:32.510 --> 41:34.603
I don't know this place.

41:34.679 --> 41:36.613
I don't want any surprises.

41:36.681 --> 41:38.376
All right, I'll do it.

41:39.483 --> 41:41.713
What is going on upstairs?

41:43.187 --> 41:44.449
Damn it.

41:44.522 --> 41:45.511
Breathe.

41:47.024 --> 41:48.491
Tim's gonna make it.

41:48.559 --> 41:49.719
He always does.

41:50.861 --> 41:52.726
He's stronger than
all of us put together.

41:53.831 --> 41:54.820
Yeah.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.424
I know that.

41:57.501 --> 41:59.332
And I believe that.

41:59.403 --> 42:00.392
I just...

42:02.173 --> 42:04.198
I'm sick of looking over my shoulder

42:04.275 --> 42:05.606
and not knowing who to trust.

42:07.345 --> 42:08.778
How do you feel, young man?

42:08.846 --> 42:10.108
Better.

42:10.181 --> 42:12.012
- Now that you're here.
- Tim.

42:12.083 --> 42:13.550
It's fine. It's cute.

42:13.618 --> 42:15.313
Cute, huh?

42:15.386 --> 42:17.286
You had all the lab technicians
scratching their heads.

42:17.355 --> 42:18.686
Let me guess.

42:19.924 --> 42:21.721
I'm a werewolf.

42:21.792 --> 42:23.316
Not quite.

42:23.394 --> 42:25.123
But he does have
a very rare blood type.

42:25.196 --> 42:26.686
Not only that,
but his white blood count

42:26.764 --> 42:28.197
was off the charts.

42:28.266 --> 42:30.632
Uh, he gets that from me.
I'm AB negative.

42:30.701 --> 42:32.498
That's not it.
What about his father?

42:35.039 --> 42:36.267
That's a tough one.

42:36.340 --> 42:37.705
Well, we're not sure.

42:37.775 --> 42:38.673
Okay.

42:40.144 --> 42:41.941
You have some pretty strong blood

42:42.013 --> 42:43.674
running through you.

42:47.652 --> 42:49.552
Adam.

42:49.620 --> 42:51.679
We are so close.

42:51.756 --> 42:55.055
Before we know it,
our lives are gonna be our own.

42:55.126 --> 42:58.459
We can be
whatever we want to be.

42:58.529 --> 42:59.860
Okay?

43:00.865 --> 43:01.991
We're so close.

43:03.868 --> 43:05.165
I want to be your better half.

43:05.236 --> 43:06.567
Well, it's long hours.

43:06.637 --> 43:08.036
Yeah.

43:08.105 --> 43:10.403
What's the pay?

43:10.474 --> 43:12.237
It's more about the benefits.

43:23.888 --> 43:26.118
How long before
we can be on our way?

43:28.125 --> 43:29.490
Let me go talk to the doctor.

43:29.560 --> 43:31.187
Don't be a stranger.

43:32.563 --> 43:33.552
Thank you.

43:37.001 --> 43:39.401
What? I'm almost 13, you know.

43:56.721 --> 43:57.710
How is he?

43:57.788 --> 43:59.881
He's doing okay. We'll be
out of here in no time.

44:00.891 --> 44:02.415
Adam, get to the roof.

44:02.493 --> 44:04.324
You might see something we can't.

44:04.395 --> 44:05.726
Kat, you take the back entrance.

44:05.796 --> 44:06.785
I'm gonna stay here.

44:07.832 --> 44:09.060
Mom?

44:09.834 --> 44:12.029
I want to get out of here.

44:12.103 --> 44:13.593
We need to leave.

44:13.671 --> 44:16.640
I know. Doak's gone
to find someone.

44:16.707 --> 44:17.731
It'll be a minute.

44:21.145 --> 44:22.874
Car accident. Head trauma.

45:03.454 --> 45:05.388
Let's take a look.

45:29.280 --> 45:30.178
Jonas.

45:30.247 --> 45:32.010
Bring the RV around now.

45:52.203 --> 45:53.465
Excuse me.

45:53.537 --> 45:56.165
Can you get a doctor, please?
We'd like to leave.

45:56.240 --> 45:57.502
Hey, what are you doing?

45:57.575 --> 45:58.940
Mom!

46:09.720 --> 46:11.779
No! No!

46:17.461 --> 46:18.860
It's time to die.

46:18.929 --> 46:20.021
No!

46:24.502 --> 46:25.594
Tim, get up!

46:25.669 --> 46:27.728
Go, Timmy, go! Go!
Get off!

46:27.805 --> 46:29.636
You okay? Come on, get up!
Get up, Mom!

46:34.912 --> 46:36.345
Come on!

46:36.413 --> 46:37.971
Let's go. Come on!

46:46.857 --> 46:47.881
Hey!

47:07.111 --> 47:08.271
No!

47:09.246 --> 47:10.679
Get ready, Doak!

47:13.484 --> 47:15.111
Now! Go! Go! Go!

47:15.185 --> 47:16.447
Move, move, move!

47:17.288 --> 47:18.448
Move! Move! Move!

47:25.396 --> 47:26.260
Rachel!

47:31.936 --> 47:32.925
No!

47:37.341 --> 47:39.707
- It's okay.
- No! No!

47:43.113 --> 47:44.102
Come here.

47:45.849 --> 47:47.111
Come on! In the truck!

47:47.184 --> 47:49.084
- Take him.
- Come on! Come on!

47:59.863 --> 48:00.852
Jonas.

48:03.434 --> 48:05.231
Let's stop all of this...

48:06.537 --> 48:07.799
...brother.

48:10.941 --> 48:12.272
Cover me, Will.

48:16.113 --> 48:17.444
Let her go, Caleb.

48:25.823 --> 48:26.812
Caleb?

48:46.377 --> 48:48.402
Don't make me do something
I don't want to do.

48:50.047 --> 48:51.309
Join me.

48:51.382 --> 48:53.646
We're one and the same.

48:53.717 --> 48:55.514
I'm nothing like you.

48:55.586 --> 48:57.713
I am what I was meant to be.

48:59.390 --> 49:01.187
You live a lie.

49:02.793 --> 49:04.351
You were wrong.

49:04.428 --> 49:07.090
I know what you're feeling. Trust me.

49:08.666 --> 49:09.655
Trust you?

49:13.437 --> 49:16.668
You're killing
fellow human beings.

49:16.740 --> 49:19.675
I am not human.

49:19.743 --> 49:23.577
And I will not risk spending
the rest of my days as one.

49:25.616 --> 49:28.141
Diseased and flawed.

49:30.954 --> 49:32.478
We're better than that.

49:33.891 --> 49:35.153
Let her go, Caleb.

49:37.261 --> 49:38.523
Let her go.

49:38.595 --> 49:40.688
I'll make you a deal.

49:40.764 --> 49:43.597
Katherine for the boy.

49:44.768 --> 49:48.397
My daughter for your son.

49:54.878 --> 49:55.867
What?

49:56.513 --> 49:58.413
What the hell's
he talkin' about, Varek?

49:59.650 --> 50:00.981
No.

50:17.901 --> 50:18.993
Screw this!

50:33.083 --> 50:36.109
You told me he was dead,
Uncle Jonas.

50:36.186 --> 50:38.586
You all told me that.

50:38.655 --> 50:40.953
You all lied to me.

50:41.024 --> 50:42.355
You said he was dead!

50:42.426 --> 50:44.155
No! Mom!

50:45.162 --> 50:46.186
They've got her.

50:47.765 --> 50:50.700
Oh, my God, Jonas!
They've got Kat!

51:11.889 --> 51:13.550
How you holdin' up, kiddo?

51:25.068 --> 51:26.399
I thought he was dead.

51:31.041 --> 51:32.406
Well, you were wrong.

51:34.845 --> 51:36.904
Now he's trying to kill my son.

51:40.717 --> 51:42.184
His son.

51:47.291 --> 51:49.122
We have to keep on.

52:10.848 --> 52:12.110
She was your wife?

52:12.182 --> 52:13.479
It was another life.

52:13.550 --> 52:15.074
And that was your son?

52:15.152 --> 52:16.710
I didn't know.

52:18.255 --> 52:19.813
It changes nothing.

52:19.890 --> 52:21.721
It changes everything.

52:21.792 --> 52:24.556
That kid has to die.

52:24.628 --> 52:25.856
You know,
Sonja's right, Varek.

52:25.929 --> 52:27.226
This is screwed up.
That boy has to die!

52:27.297 --> 52:28.889
I know.

52:28.966 --> 52:31.230
I don't care whose kid it is.

52:31.301 --> 52:32.563
You can't hesitate.

52:32.636 --> 52:34.365
You shut your mouth.

52:34.438 --> 52:36.838
You question my resolve?

52:36.907 --> 52:38.499
That boy has no father.

52:39.943 --> 52:41.570
And I have no son.

53:06.803 --> 53:08.065
Jonas.

53:08.138 --> 53:10.732
This is our best chance, Adam.

53:10.807 --> 53:12.604
Will and I know this place.
It's safe.

53:13.477 --> 53:14.944
We'll be able to wait it out here.

53:15.012 --> 53:16.274
We can protect him here.

53:16.346 --> 53:18.314
Tell me she isn't worth it.

53:19.683 --> 53:21.981
Tell me she isn't worth
going back for.

53:30.093 --> 53:31.583
Why are you doing this?

53:35.732 --> 53:37.791
He knows he's got
my only weakness.

53:37.868 --> 53:40.428
That's why she's still alive, Adam.

53:40.504 --> 53:41.766
And that's why we can't go back,

53:41.838 --> 53:42.896
because that's
what he's counting on.

53:48.745 --> 53:50.337
They're gonna torture
her mercilessly...

53:50.414 --> 53:52.348
Please don't.

53:52.416 --> 53:54.407
Well, this should be interesting.

53:54.484 --> 53:56.975
...and you know she won't break.

53:58.055 --> 53:59.682
Can you live with that?

54:05.429 --> 54:06.760
Neither can I.

54:08.098 --> 54:10.862
It's just one more day, Adam,
and all this will be over.

54:10.934 --> 54:13.664
Everything we believe in
lives in Timothy.

54:13.737 --> 54:15.671
Everything I believe in is out there.

54:15.739 --> 54:17.331
She's gone, Adam.

54:17.407 --> 54:19.500
Now, if you go back,
it'll be the end of us.

54:21.745 --> 54:23.110
Jonas.

54:23.780 --> 54:25.145
We're as safe
as we're gonna get.

54:25.215 --> 54:26.614
Time to lock down.

54:27.484 --> 54:29.042
All right.

54:30.387 --> 54:33.322
Adam, you first. Let's go.

54:33.390 --> 54:36.188
The red moon is gonna be
even stronger tonight.

55:50.267 --> 55:51.598
Adam.

55:56.406 --> 55:58.067
Adam, I want you to find
some higher ground

55:58.141 --> 56:00.234
and keep your eyes peeled.

56:00.310 --> 56:01.436
Adam.

57:07.043 --> 57:09.307
Get Timothy. We're leaving now.

57:09.379 --> 57:11.404
We're no longer safe here.

57:12.716 --> 57:14.047
How did he become one of them?

57:18.488 --> 57:21.082
The night of the attack,
we thought he was dead.

57:22.425 --> 57:24.188
But we were wrong.

57:24.261 --> 57:25.990
Now, he must have survived
and he must have hunted,

57:26.062 --> 57:27.086
'cause now he's one of them.

57:27.164 --> 57:29.064
Jonas, it's Caleb.

57:29.132 --> 57:30.759
My husband. Your brother!

57:30.834 --> 57:33.826
The Caleb that you loved
died that night.

57:33.904 --> 57:36.498
He is not dead.

57:36.573 --> 57:38.666
How could you lie to me
all these years?

57:38.742 --> 57:40.869
I did it to protect you.

57:40.944 --> 57:42.707
Now, he's taken Katherine.

57:42.779 --> 57:45.441
You don't think
that I feel any of that?

57:45.515 --> 57:46.413
Do you?

57:47.817 --> 57:49.614
I'm not like you, Jonas.

57:49.686 --> 57:51.745
Any of you. Remember?

57:54.157 --> 57:56.785
I don't have a beast inside of me.

57:56.860 --> 57:58.521
Well, you better find it,

57:58.595 --> 58:00.995
or your son will die.

58:01.998 --> 58:03.329
Jonas!

58:05.135 --> 58:06.466
He found her.

58:23.787 --> 58:27.382
I told you not to go.
Now You've led them to us.

58:28.458 --> 58:30.653
I didn't see anyone.

58:38.168 --> 58:40.068
Everybody in the truck.

58:41.071 --> 58:42.333
We gotta go now.

58:49.346 --> 58:50.813
Tim?

58:50.880 --> 58:52.541
You okay, baby?

58:59.589 --> 59:02.080
I couldn't believe
that it was him, Daddy.

59:03.927 --> 59:05.827
He looked so different.

59:09.532 --> 59:12.990
He... He wanted to know
where we were headed.

59:15.272 --> 59:18.730
The others
wanted me dead, but...

59:20.443 --> 59:22.138
...he wouldn't allow it.

59:25.115 --> 59:27.083
I guess he saved my life.

59:29.085 --> 59:30.677
They're gonna be on our tail now.

59:31.955 --> 59:33.547
Hopefully we can make up
some time tonight.

59:35.525 --> 59:37.322
I'm sorry, Jonas.

59:37.394 --> 59:38.691
I couldn't leave her.

59:38.762 --> 59:40.059
Yeah, I know.

59:44.401 --> 59:46.198
I love you.

01:00:17.667 --> 01:00:18.565
It's all right.
It's okay.

01:00:18.635 --> 01:00:21.229
It's okay, sweetheart.

01:00:21.304 --> 01:00:23.169
We'll talk about it in the morning.

01:00:23.239 --> 01:00:24.763
I'll finish with Kat.

01:00:24.841 --> 01:00:26.536
You two get yourselves locked up.

01:00:26.609 --> 01:00:27.871
She's gonna need some time.

01:00:27.944 --> 01:00:29.377
I'm sorry.

01:00:29.479 --> 01:00:31.970
I just don't remember.

01:00:33.316 --> 01:00:34.578
It's all right.

01:00:34.651 --> 01:00:35.845
I wish I had more for you.

01:00:35.919 --> 01:00:36.908
It's okay.

01:00:40.256 --> 01:00:43.851
Jonas. We gotta get locked down.

01:00:43.927 --> 01:00:46.293
You're gonna be okay, Katherine.

01:00:46.363 --> 01:00:48.297
Try and relax.

01:00:48.365 --> 01:00:51.061
We're gonna take this
one step at a time.

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:08.381
My head.

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:16.616
Daddy, something's
wrong with me.

01:01:16.693 --> 01:01:17.523
Kat, what is it?

01:01:17.594 --> 01:01:19.960
Get you hands off me,
you son of a...

01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:21.553
Will, lock her down. Do it now.

01:01:21.631 --> 01:01:24.327
Don't! Just leave me alone.

01:01:24.401 --> 01:01:26.460
I don't know what's happening.

01:01:26.536 --> 01:01:27.833
I can't control it.

01:01:27.904 --> 01:01:29.997
It's impossible.
They left her for dead.

01:01:30.073 --> 01:01:31.506
No!

01:01:32.575 --> 01:01:34.338
Will, damn it! He made her feed!

01:01:34.411 --> 01:01:35.901
Do it now! Lock her down!

01:01:35.979 --> 01:01:37.606
He gave me life.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.985
Will?

01:01:45.054 --> 01:01:46.021
Will, what happened?

01:01:51.861 --> 01:01:53.123
Adam.

01:01:53.196 --> 01:01:55.187
She'll kill us, and she'll kill Timothy.

01:01:55.265 --> 01:01:56.391
It's what Varek wanted.

01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:59.191
Baby...

01:01:59.269 --> 01:02:01.794
you have no idea
what you're missing.

01:02:01.871 --> 01:02:04.669
God, it's so amazing.

01:02:04.741 --> 01:02:06.208
We can feel it together.

01:02:06.276 --> 01:02:08.267
She's gone, Adam. She's turned.

01:02:08.344 --> 01:02:10.437
- Let me kiss you.
- That's not Katherine anymore.

01:02:14.951 --> 01:02:15.975
Don't make me do this.

01:02:16.052 --> 01:02:18.020
- Jonas, please.
- She's gone, Adam.

01:02:18.087 --> 01:02:19.782
You gotta do it!
You gotta do something!

01:02:25.395 --> 01:02:26.327
Jonas.

01:02:36.539 --> 01:02:38.234
You shot me, you little prick!

01:02:38.308 --> 01:02:39.605
I'm sorry. It'll be okay.

01:02:39.676 --> 01:02:41.303
All right? I... You'll...

01:02:44.547 --> 01:02:45.571
Baby?

01:02:50.353 --> 01:02:51.684
Help me.

01:02:53.923 --> 01:02:55.015
Please.

01:02:56.993 --> 01:02:58.051
I don't know.

01:02:59.529 --> 01:03:00.826
She's gone, Adam.

01:03:00.897 --> 01:03:02.728
You gotta do something.
She's gone.

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.465
Adam. She's gone.

01:03:08.471 --> 01:03:09.460
No.

01:03:12.275 --> 01:03:14.106
Don't. Don't do it.

01:03:16.379 --> 01:03:18.040
Don't, Katherine.

01:03:18.114 --> 01:03:19.445
Kat, I love you.

01:03:21.251 --> 01:03:23.116
I lo...

01:03:23.186 --> 01:03:24.653
You love me, too.

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:35.229
All right, that's enough, baby.

01:03:35.298 --> 01:03:36.629
That's enough.

01:03:37.767 --> 01:03:39.029
Katherine.

01:03:46.209 --> 01:03:47.301
Please, Katherine.

01:03:49.145 --> 01:03:50.510
Give me that.

01:03:51.381 --> 01:03:52.405
Please.

01:03:54.851 --> 01:03:57.115
You were wrong, Daddy.

01:03:59.622 --> 01:04:00.611
Timothy.

01:04:02.725 --> 01:04:03.953
Open the door, kiddo.

01:04:04.027 --> 01:04:05.494
Timothy, don't!

01:04:05.562 --> 01:04:07.223
- Timothy, stay down.
- No, Timothy. Don't!

01:04:07.297 --> 01:04:08.628
- Keep the door closed!
- Quiet!

01:04:11.935 --> 01:04:13.061
Timothy.

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:15.501
- Come on, kiddo.
- No!

01:04:15.572 --> 01:04:16.971
- Sit... down.
- Timothy, come out!

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.701
Keep the door closed, Tim.

01:04:24.047 --> 01:04:25.981
It doesn't have to be this way.

01:04:27.383 --> 01:04:28.850
Don't you want to feel
what I'm feeling?

01:04:28.918 --> 01:04:30.283
Katherine.

01:04:30.353 --> 01:04:31.479
Think about what you're doing.

01:04:32.989 --> 01:04:34.513
You helped raise that boy.

01:04:34.591 --> 01:04:36.923
This is not you.

01:04:36.993 --> 01:04:38.017
It's not you.

01:04:39.495 --> 01:04:41.190
You have to fight it.

01:04:41.264 --> 01:04:43.357
Kat, you have to fight it.

01:04:43.433 --> 01:04:44.764
Give me your hand.

01:04:44.834 --> 01:04:47.132
- Give me your hand.
- Timothy.

01:04:47.203 --> 01:04:48.693
Open the door.

01:04:48.771 --> 01:04:50.602
No! Keep the door closed!

01:04:50.673 --> 01:04:52.800
Uncle Jonas is trying to hurt me.

01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:54.206
Keep driving!

01:04:54.277 --> 01:04:55.471
Timothy, don't.

01:04:58.514 --> 01:05:00.379
- Timothy!
- Close the door! He's gonna die!

01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:01.439
- Kat?
- Close the door!

01:05:01.517 --> 01:05:02.711
Rachel, keep driving!

01:05:02.785 --> 01:05:04.275
Don't stop! Keep driving!

01:05:06.522 --> 01:05:08.490
Close the door, now!

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.419
Please. Please, stop it.

01:05:14.497 --> 01:05:15.759
I'll miss you, Daddy.

01:05:15.832 --> 01:05:17.322
No, don't do it.

01:05:24.307 --> 01:05:25.797
Oh, my God.

01:05:34.617 --> 01:05:35.982
Oh, my God.

01:06:51.561 --> 01:06:52.619
There it is.

01:06:53.229 --> 01:06:55.026
We only have to make it
till midnight.

01:06:58.835 --> 01:07:01.167
Three bodies, but there's no kid.

01:07:01.237 --> 01:07:02.534
There's nothin' back there.

01:07:02.605 --> 01:07:03.697
They're all gone.

01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:08.299
They're close.

01:07:12.048 --> 01:07:13.675
Just one more hour.

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:14.842
We'll be safe in here.

01:07:15.852 --> 01:07:17.285
It has a steel door.

01:07:17.353 --> 01:07:19.116
Lock's on the inside.

01:07:19.188 --> 01:07:20.621
- What are you thinking?
- Well, I'm out there,

01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:22.487
and you're in here with Tim.

01:07:23.893 --> 01:07:25.451
You want to go out there alone?

01:07:25.528 --> 01:07:27.189
I got a few tricks up my sleeve.

01:07:28.431 --> 01:07:29.796
Let me help you, Jonas.

01:07:29.866 --> 01:07:31.265
Now, you listen to me.

01:07:31.334 --> 01:07:33.131
After I turn, I'm gonna be
fighting the need to feed.

01:07:33.202 --> 01:07:34.760
We're here. We can help you.

01:07:34.837 --> 01:07:37.499
On anything... and anyone.

01:07:39.876 --> 01:07:42.037
Now, I don't know
what's gonna happen.

01:07:42.111 --> 01:07:45.012
But if I feed,
I'll probably lose control.

01:07:46.415 --> 01:07:47.905
And you're not gonna
have a choice.

01:07:49.485 --> 01:07:50.816
Kill me.

01:07:51.921 --> 01:07:53.650
You gotta kill me.

01:07:53.723 --> 01:07:54.985
You swear it.

01:07:55.057 --> 01:07:56.251
Swear to it, Rachel.

01:07:57.527 --> 01:07:59.154
You'll have no choice.

01:08:13.476 --> 01:08:15.740
It's not for another hour,
but happy birthday, Timothy.

01:08:21.684 --> 01:08:23.618
We just have to last until midnight.

01:08:23.685 --> 01:08:25.346
You're gonna be okay, Tim.

01:08:35.564 --> 01:08:36.827
Don't open the door.

01:10:05.254 --> 01:10:06.243
Here.

01:11:36.412 --> 01:11:37.709
Uncle Jo...

01:11:40.583 --> 01:11:41.607
Get down.

01:13:23.719 --> 01:13:24.708
Mom!

01:14:32.254 --> 01:14:33.721
We've gotta move now.

01:14:52.508 --> 01:14:53.497
Please.

01:14:56.045 --> 01:14:57.478
Don't hurt him.

01:15:21.837 --> 01:15:22.861
No!

01:15:39.321 --> 01:15:40.345
Mom!

01:15:42.091 --> 01:15:43.581
Mom, wake up! Please!

01:15:43.659 --> 01:15:44.648
Mom, get up!

01:15:44.727 --> 01:15:45.785
Mom, wake up!

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.389
Mom!

01:15:52.468 --> 01:15:54.402
Uncle Jonas is in trouble.

01:16:14.023 --> 01:16:16.048
Uncle Jonas! No!

01:16:18.327 --> 01:16:19.157
Don't!

01:16:29.271 --> 01:16:30.260
Uncle Jonas.

01:17:26.862 --> 01:17:28.420
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:35.359
No.

01:18:52.114 --> 01:18:53.775
Are you okay?

01:19:35.224 --> 01:19:36.122
Dad?

01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:42.819
Dad?

01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:03.307
Can I help you?

01:21:03.378 --> 01:21:05.175
We'd like a room.

01:21:10.652 --> 01:21:12.176
I need your names

01:21:12.254 --> 01:21:13.653
and a credit card.

01:21:13.722 --> 01:21:15.781
It'll be cash.

01:21:15.857 --> 01:21:17.654
Cash works.

01:21:36.345 --> 01:21:39.041
Sorry. My wife's a little jumpy.

01:21:39.114 --> 01:21:40.138
Yeah, sorry.

01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:43.344
It's just one of those nights.

01:22:02.437 --> 01:22:05.804
So many people sacrificed
their lives for me.

01:22:05.874 --> 01:22:08.069
And now we make sure
they didn't die in vain.

01:22:12.948 --> 01:22:14.813
Uncle Jonas was right after all.

01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:20.879
I do have the power
to end the curse.

01:22:24.893 --> 01:22:27.657
It's just not going to be
as easy as they all hoped.

01:22:30.399 --> 01:22:31.991
The power is in my blood.

01:22:50.419 --> 01:22:51.545
I've heard...

01:22:53.755 --> 01:22:55.484
I'm here to be cured.

01:23:02.264 --> 01:23:05.825
For some, I am salvation.

01:23:08.236 --> 01:23:09.601
For the others...

01:23:09.671 --> 01:23:11.007
their
destruction.
