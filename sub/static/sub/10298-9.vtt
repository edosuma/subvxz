Hi, Daddy.

01:45.667 --> 01:47.734
I saw you pushing the car.
Doesn't it work?

01:47.734 --> 01:50.400
Well, sure it does,
honey.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.033
It was just such
a nice day,

I didn't want to waste
it sitting in the car,

pretty boring.

In your travels
in the back yard,

11:59.534 --> 12:02.801

from the tree,

12:02.801 --> 12:06.267
twelve-feet down.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.400

find a box,

12:08.400 --> 12:10.501
with, say,
oh, about, uh,

12:10.501 --> 12:14.067
$5,000 in it?

12:15.467 --> 12:17.767
Was that yours?

12:18.901 --> 12:20.033
Yes.

12:20.033 --> 12:22.434
Where do you think
it came from?

12:22.434 --> 12:26.334
Well, I just figured
that, uh,

12:26.334 --> 12:28.667
before the white man
settled the area,

12:28.667 --> 12:30.801

buried it there.

12:32.167 --> 12:33.767

theIndians

12:35.067 --> 12:37.601
write "Al"
on the box?

12:39.868 --> 12:41.434
Well,

12:41.434 --> 12:45.167

someone killed the guy

12:45.167 --> 12:46.167

12:46.167 --> 12:50.100
"A lot of money
for whoever finds it."

12:54.033 --> 12:56.701
Well, then, I guess I have
some bad news for me.

my new car fund, Peg,

12:59.200 --> 13:01.801

long time ago.

you spend $4,200?

13:12.100 --> 13:14.968

you yelled at me

13:14.968 --> 13:17.434

any juice in the house?

13:17.434 --> 13:20.133
Well, I took some money,
and I bought you juice.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.334
And a coat for me.

13:24.334 --> 13:26.367
And then, remember when
you demanded dinner?

13:26.367 --> 13:28.000
Well, I took
some more money

13:28.000 --> 13:31.234

a bucket of chicken.

to bury something else.
