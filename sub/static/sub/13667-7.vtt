<i>- Previously on St. Elsewhere.
- She's dead, man.</i>

00:05.339 --> 00:09.333
- Hey, now.
Come on, Pete. It's over!
- That's the second lady today.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.602
Okay. How long?
Thirty-Five minutes.

00:11.669 --> 00:13.737
Give it up.

00:13.804 --> 00:16.674
Three people have died
with symptoms of legionnaires'.

00:16.740 --> 00:18.609
Donald would like to
close down the ward.

00:18.676 --> 00:21.211
Don't you think
closing it down
is a little extreme?

00:21.278 --> 00:23.180
No, I don't,
not if it's legionnaires'.

00:23.247 --> 00:27.017
- Don't worry, son.
You're gonna be all right.
- Close down the ward.

00:27.084 --> 00:29.687
<i>Ward 5 is to be
completely sealed.</i>

00:29.753 --> 00:32.423
<i>[ announcer ]
this week on st. Elsewhere.</i>

00:32.488 --> 00:34.892
[ Shouting ]
will everyone shut up
for one lousy minute?

00:34.958 --> 00:38.095
Tell me
this chaos will end.
This chaos will end.

00:38.162 --> 00:40.531
Have you felt this way
any other time?

00:40.597 --> 00:43.901
No. I haven't wanted
to be a bird once either.

00:43.967 --> 00:46.070
And now she's
three months' pregnant.

00:46.136 --> 00:49.606
<i>And the problem is,
she's only been out of here
for two months.</i>

00:49.673 --> 00:52.209
- Oh, boy.
- Dr. Westphall Heard
from Atlanta.

00:52.276 --> 00:54.211
It is legionnaires' disease.

00:54.278 --> 00:57.314
- What would that mean?
- The entire hospital would
have to be closed down.

00:57.381 --> 01:00.384
You resent
taking responsibility
for your actions.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.419
If I had it to do over,
nothing would Change.

02:44.054 --> 02:46.357
<i>[ westphall ]
there's no question about it.</i>

02:46.423 --> 02:48.425
<i>The evacuation
and relocation process...</i>

02:48.492 --> 02:51.762
<i>was considerably more involved
than any of us had planned.</i>

02:51.829 --> 02:55.432
<i>But 35 patients
have been safely transferred
from, uh, ward 5,</i>

02:55.499 --> 02:58.502
<i>and that ward will remain closed
until we receive confirmation...</i>

02:58.569 --> 03:03.007
<i>from Dr. Borovay
 from the C.D.C. In Atlanta.</i>

03:03.073 --> 03:07.044
<i>And I must tell you
that, uh, we fully expect
that Dr. Borovay...</i>

03:07.111 --> 03:11.215
<i>will confirm
our preliminary diagnosis
of legionnaires' disease.</i>

03:11.281 --> 03:13.650
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
since you're not doctors,</i>

03:13.717 --> 03:16.487
<i>it might be worthwhile
if I tell you a bit
about this disease.</i>

03:16.553 --> 03:20.290
<i>Legionnaires'
is a respiratory infection,
very often results in pneumonia.</i>

03:20.357 --> 03:23.027
It's preceded
by diarrhea, high fever,

03:23.093 --> 03:25.129
slow pulse rate,
productive cough.

03:25.195 --> 03:28.699
It's usually found
in patients who are
already extremely ill...

03:28.766 --> 03:31.402
or Those patients
who have a low resistance
to infection.

03:31.468 --> 03:34.972
It's thought to arise
from Contaminated
Respiratory equipment...

03:35.039 --> 03:37.374
or ventilating Systems.

03:37.441 --> 03:40.611
Donald, can we open this
up to questions?

03:40.678 --> 03:42.613
Fine.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.883
You said that seven
of the 35 patients...

03:45.949 --> 03:48.786
were classified
as high-Risk probabilities.

03:48.852 --> 03:51.488
Yes, they're in isolation
on ward 2 east.

03:51.555 --> 03:53.590
And that required
some more beds
to be shuffled.

03:53.657 --> 03:58.495
Thirty-Five patients
from 2 East were transferred
to the fourth floor.

03:58.562 --> 04:03.067
That's where you placed
the other 28 patients
from ward 5.

04:03.133 --> 04:06.136
As you know,
the fourth floor has
the largest capacity--

04:06.203 --> 04:08.972
That's 44
additional patients...

04:09.039 --> 04:12.843
in a ward whose resources
are being taxed
to the fullest.

04:12.910 --> 04:14.912
In a situation like this,
Mr. Cummings--

04:14.978 --> 04:18.449
my question,
as hospital administrator,

04:18.515 --> 04:21.118
is how can your staff
possibly handle the load?

04:27.491 --> 04:29.994
I don't want to just sit around.
Are we doing rounds or what?

04:30.060 --> 04:32.062
Don't tell me nobody
ordered a kosher plate.

04:32.129 --> 04:35.265
We need a g.I. Consult--
419, fast.
I put her chart right there.

04:35.332 --> 04:38.469
Big mistake,
especially with the craziness
around here these days.

04:38.535 --> 04:41.772
Her name is "Alamo."
Alaimo. Carol alaimo.

04:41.839 --> 04:44.541
She was admitted before
they brought everyone in
from ward 5.

04:44.608 --> 04:48.178
Sorry, Victor.
I gotta talk to a doctor.
I feel woozy.

04:48.245 --> 04:50.180
Maybe it's chicken pox.

04:50.247 --> 04:52.449
No, this ain't the chicken pox.
I had the chicken pox.

04:52.516 --> 04:54.685
This is a lot worse than
the stupid chicken pox.

04:54.752 --> 04:57.988
It's in good condition, huh?
Good condition?
Mint condition.

04:58.055 --> 05:01.225
I'm really not in the market
for a car, mark.
Not a car. A classic.

05:01.291 --> 05:04.294
You did lamaze, didn't you?
Yeah, it's all right
the first time.

05:04.361 --> 05:07.197
What do you mean?
By the time you get
to your second kid,

05:07.264 --> 05:10.200
you're gonna wish the stork
really did drop it down
out of the chimney.

05:10.267 --> 05:13.804
It's all right. You got time
to decide. They don't start
lamaze till the seventh month.

05:13.871 --> 05:18.676
2,100 tongue Depressors.
5,400 cotton swabs.
3,000 plastic Strips.

05:18.742 --> 05:21.478
Ramon, this
is not the best time
to take inventory.

05:21.545 --> 05:25.549
Inventory? I'm talking
about what's been ripped off
since we moved down from 5.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.551
What?
Yeah!

05:27.618 --> 05:30.421
<i>[ Daniels ]

I am calling my attorney!

05:34.124 --> 05:36.894
Mrs. Sabin, lighten up.
Okay.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.664
I reduced the dosage
to 50 milligrams.

05:40.731 --> 05:43.200
We'll start
the N.G. Suction
after Rounds.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.406
Well, what did you expect?
A hug and a kiss?

05:49.473 --> 05:51.975
Hey, I did not ask
to be transferred
to this floor.

05:52.042 --> 05:54.011
No. Neither
did skilling.

05:57.147 --> 05:59.650
Skilling's the one
he tried to get fired
for incompetence, right?

05:59.717 --> 06:03.554
Right. You know,
those two are a match
made in heaven.

06:03.620 --> 06:06.090
Reminds me
of my third Marriage.

06:06.156 --> 06:08.826
Mrs. Sabin wants out.
Who's her doctor?

06:08.892 --> 06:11.895
Some plastic surgeon
from brookline. She's in
for a Tuck 'n' roll.

06:11.962 --> 06:13.931
Give her the Forms.

06:15.399 --> 06:18.902
412? Shirley, I asked you
to go down to 412.

06:18.969 --> 06:22.639
I took that call
10 minutes ago.
Martha mulvahey.

06:22.706 --> 06:25.209
She needed
her Pillow Propped.
Again?

06:25.275 --> 06:28.445
The girl's a pest, Helen.
After all, she's only in
for a consult.

06:28.512 --> 06:32.983
No, no, no, no.
They did a multiple x-Ray
and bone scan yesterday.

06:33.050 --> 06:35.853
Dr. Ashley thinks it's
an acute septic Arthritis.

06:35.919 --> 06:37.921
Very, very bad
in her hands.

06:37.988 --> 06:39.990
This is her fifth
flare-up this year.

06:40.057 --> 06:42.292
So, who's gonna
answer the call?

06:42.359 --> 06:44.728
Well, I guess I will.
Oh, listen.

06:44.795 --> 06:48.699
Cancel that g.I. Consult in 419.
Now they need a neurologist.
Right.

06:48.766 --> 06:52.469
Okay!
Where is Carol alaimo?

06:52.536 --> 06:54.672
What's it worth to you?

06:56.573 --> 06:58.509
Oh, stop!

06:58.575 --> 07:01.045
Good morning, Martha.
What's the problem?

07:01.111 --> 07:04.114
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I can't adjust the bed.

07:04.181 --> 07:06.417
You just push the Button.

07:06.483 --> 07:09.486
Oh. Could you
help me, please?

07:09.553 --> 07:12.523

with my arthritis.
Sure.

07:12.589 --> 07:14.992
You know,
it's really pretty easy.

07:15.059 --> 07:19.196
It's just the same way
you call the Nurses.
Thanks.

07:19.263 --> 07:22.099
Okay?
Yeah.

07:22.166 --> 07:27.037
I heard you had a ROUGH night
last night. Were your joints
giving you a lot of pain?

07:27.104 --> 07:30.741
It wasn't so bad.
You certainly kept
my nurses on their toes.

07:30.808 --> 07:33.777
I had trouble Sleeping.
How are you feeling now?

07:33.844 --> 07:36.347
About the same.

07:36.413 --> 07:38.615
Apologize to the nurses
for me.

07:38.682 --> 07:42.286
I know it's overcrowded,
and I know how hard
Everybody's working.

07:42.353 --> 07:44.421
Things are very hectic.
Yeah.

07:44.488 --> 07:49.093
<i>By the way, I started reading
Alice in Wonderland last night
to my two youngest.</i>

07:49.159 --> 07:52.963
I had to drag them away from the
television, but once I started,
they wouldn't let me stop.

07:53.030 --> 07:56.867
It's funny how you
forget that kind of stuff--
How wonderful some books are.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.570
I hope you didn't tell them
that a librarian
recommended it.

07:59.636 --> 08:01.805
Certainly not.
I'm no fool.

08:01.872 --> 08:04.842

to bother you.

08:04.908 --> 08:08.045
Okay. Take it easy.
Okay.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.247
I'm starting to get
the impression...

08:10.314 --> 08:13.517
you resent
taking responsibility
for your actions.

08:13.584 --> 08:15.552
No, that's not True at all.

08:15.619 --> 08:19.123
I may have overlooked some
administrative procedures.
I'm sorry if I did.

08:19.189 --> 08:22.226
But seven people
are resting comfortably
in isolation right now,

08:22.292 --> 08:25.729
three of whom might be dead
at this time if we hadn't
acted when we did.

08:27.131 --> 08:30.668
If I had it to do over,
nothing would change.

08:32.568 --> 08:35.371
I offered to go
below blue book...

08:35.438 --> 08:38.509
and throw in
a full 90-Day warranty.

08:38.575 --> 08:41.211
I was even willing
to replace
the Hood ornament.

08:41.278 --> 08:45.315
What about the Ping
in the cylinders?
What Ping?

08:45.382 --> 08:48.419
And where did you learn
your methodology, young lady?
In a cesspool?

08:48.485 --> 08:53.924
Wrists up. Left to right.
Lateral in. Right to left.
Lateral out.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.727
Do you want to contaminate
the patient?

08:56.794 --> 09:00.064

that the caliber

would deteriorate
so rapidly
in my lifetime?

09:08.539 --> 09:10.941

the fraternal bond?

09:11.008 --> 09:13.977
It's a sad,
sad commentary.

Never mind.

If he doesn't unload
that gas hog soon,
I'm gonna go nuts.

09:19.850 --> 09:23.087
He spent 10 minutes
this morning talking
about a valve replacement.

09:23.153 --> 09:25.656
Then I realized
he didn't mean
a valve in the heart.

09:25.723 --> 09:27.925
He's still trying to unload
that blue convertible?

09:27.992 --> 09:32.796

in med school to become
a used-Car salesman.

09:36.166 --> 09:39.770
Jane, when you first came here,
you were in pretty bad shape.

09:39.837 --> 09:42.072
You, uh-- you thought
you were a bird.

09:42.139 --> 09:45.509
But when you left here
about two months ago,
you were feeling great.

09:45.576 --> 09:50.180
And you've been out there
on your own ever since,
doing just fine.

09:50.247 --> 09:54.251
So what happened?
The trolley was crowded.

09:54.318 --> 09:58.288
I didn't sleep well
the night before, and this
man was staring at me.

09:58.355 --> 10:00.958
Did you get dizzy?

10:01.025 --> 10:06.330
No, but as soon
as I sat down, I knew
I was in trouble.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.932
Why?
What did you feel like?

10:08.999 --> 10:11.669
Panicky,

10:11.735 --> 10:14.805
as though everything
was running away from me.

10:14.872 --> 10:18.208
Have you felt this way
any other time
since you left here?

10:18.275 --> 10:23.013
No, and I haven't wanted
to be a bird once either.

10:23.080 --> 10:27.584
I stopped taking
the thorazine a few weeks ago.
I was feeling so good.

10:28.919 --> 10:32.556
So, you're, uh--
You're on the trolley,

10:32.623 --> 10:35.626
and you start
to feel panicky.

10:35.693 --> 10:38.195
What happened then?

10:38.262 --> 10:42.433
I walked to an empty seat
and sat down.

10:42.499 --> 10:47.504
I remember looking out
the window and not recognizing
what I was looking at,

10:47.571 --> 10:50.607
not knowing where I was.

10:50.674 --> 10:53.243
It was so frightening.

10:53.310 --> 10:56.680
I got scared,
as though I was gonna
lose control like before.

10:56.747 --> 10:58.682
But you didn't.

10:58.749 --> 11:01.985
No, I managed to get home
and take some thorazine.

11:02.052 --> 11:06.523
I just don't want things
to fall apart like they did
before, Dr. Beale.

11:06.590 --> 11:11.362

came back here on your own
says an awful lot.

11:12.930 --> 11:14.898

to lose control.

12:57.634 --> 12:59.970
I mean, clinically,
beyond extradition.

13:00.037 --> 13:02.539
Hey, how am I
supposed to know that--
What's her name?

13:02.606 --> 13:06.243
Carol Alaimo was
transferred to Beth zion?
I'm not the attending.

13:06.310 --> 13:08.312
I think I would have
reacted the same way.

13:08.379 --> 13:13.283
It's like we're always
on the wrong end of an
outside set at Santa Cruz.

13:13.350 --> 13:16.920
I'm out there scratching
the water, trying to get out
to get through to the wave.

13:16.987 --> 13:20.824
And all of a sudden
I see 15 other surfers
on their boards,

13:20.891 --> 13:23.394
only none of them
know how to surf,
you understand?

13:23.460 --> 13:25.629
They start wiping out.
They're crashing.

13:25.696 --> 13:29.199
Boards, bodies, cords
falling over each other.

13:29.266 --> 13:33.370
Ultimately I feel
like it's my fault.
I don't know.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.939
But I'm not a Flake,
Dr. Westphall.

13:36.006 --> 13:39.843
Flakes don't graduate
first in their class, doctor,
not even in California.

13:39.910 --> 13:41.845
[ chuckles ]

13:41.912 --> 13:44.915
So, uh,
how are you holding up
through all this?

13:44.982 --> 13:48.419
Okay.
We've been hearing
these rumors.

13:48.485 --> 13:51.088
That I'm about
to be canned?

13:51.155 --> 13:54.291
Be depressing
if it were True.
Thank you.

13:54.358 --> 13:56.860
Hey, thank you,
Dr. Westphall.

13:56.927 --> 13:58.829
See you later.

14:04.768 --> 14:06.770
Hi, Alisa.
Yeah, two things.

14:06.837 --> 14:10.741
Call Mrs. Catalano and tell her
to tell the kids I can't make it
in time for dinner,

14:10.808 --> 14:12.943
but I'll be there
before they go to bed.

14:13.010 --> 14:15.012
Then call the C.D.C.
In Atlanta...

14:15.079 --> 14:19.983
'cause Dr. Borovay said
those legionnaires' tests
should be ready by now.

14:20.050 --> 14:22.019
All right? Thank you.

14:23.654 --> 14:27.758
<i>Give me
the double cheeseburger
and an order of Fries.</i>

14:28.859 --> 14:32.229
Uh, large applesauce
and, uh, saltines.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.266
It's my stomach, man.

14:36.333 --> 14:39.903
If I eat anything else,
I'm liable to spend all day
mopping up after myself.

14:39.970 --> 14:42.206
You still don't
feel any better?

14:42.272 --> 14:44.241
I feel how this looks.

14:49.046 --> 14:52.383
Molly says the board
suspended Dr. Westphall
right after the meeting.

14:52.449 --> 14:54.385
I don't believe it!

14:54.451 --> 14:56.687
New Hairdo. You're relaxed.
You're glowing.

14:56.754 --> 14:59.223
You've got a welt
on your neck the size
of a grapefruit.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.358
Come on, doctor.
Who's the lucky guy?

15:01.425 --> 15:04.061
You have an impoverished
imagination.

15:04.128 --> 15:06.630
No. In fact, I have
a fertile imagination.

15:06.697 --> 15:11.135
Comes in handy around 2:00 a.M.
Now that I'm pounding the boards
again, if you catch my drift.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.404
It didn't work out
with Cathy Martin?

15:13.470 --> 15:18.275
No, but that's okay.
I'm back with my
imaginary lover.

15:18.342 --> 15:20.611
No hassles.
We're very compatible.

15:20.678 --> 15:25.315
So, uh, does your friend
have a name?

15:26.550 --> 15:28.519
Patrick Mcfarland.
He's a fisherman.

15:28.585 --> 15:31.255
A fisherman named Patrick?

15:31.321 --> 15:33.757
Somehow I can't picture you
with a fisherman
named Patrick.

15:33.824 --> 15:36.960
Well, he's a very
interesting guy.
How'd you meet?

15:37.027 --> 15:38.962
We had a baby together.

15:39.029 --> 15:41.198
That's interesting.
Over the phone.

15:41.265 --> 15:43.267
He gave me his number,
and I called it.

15:43.334 --> 15:45.302
I'll bet
he's a working-Class
intellectual.

15:45.369 --> 15:48.439
No, just a regular guy
that makes me happy.

15:48.505 --> 15:51.041
Well, then I'm happy
for you, Annie.

15:51.108 --> 15:53.043
No, I really am.

15:53.110 --> 15:55.346
Well, thank you.

15:55.412 --> 15:59.216
It couldn't be me,
it might as well be
a fisherman with a big skiff.

15:59.283 --> 16:02.453
I knew it.
Is the smell of carp
conducive to--

16:02.519 --> 16:04.455
<i>Good-Bye, Fiscus.
Good-Bye.</i>

16:04.521 --> 16:08.325
Why don't you take Myra
to the bay tower room?
She'll love the view.

16:08.392 --> 16:11.295
The food's
not bad either.
I can't afford that.

16:11.362 --> 16:13.897
Peter, it's your
wife's birthday.

16:13.964 --> 16:18.202
If you don't do something nice
for her tonight, you'll pay
for it all year long.

16:18.268 --> 16:21.839
Tell me about it.
Tonight's the first night
I've had off since Friday.

16:21.905 --> 16:24.975
All I want to do
is I wanna go home,
I wanna go to sleep.

16:25.042 --> 16:28.946
Jack, I saw
the New Medication order
for Jane sondell.

16:29.013 --> 16:31.382
That's the one who
thought she was a bird?
Yeah.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.450
Why'd you take her
off thorazine?

16:33.517 --> 16:36.253
It's fairly
standard Procedure.
Standard? For who?

16:36.320 --> 16:38.655
I didn't authorize
any changes.

16:38.722 --> 16:42.192
It's standard procedure
to take a pregnant woman
off Thorazine.

16:45.829 --> 16:48.632
Why didn't you tell me
you were pregnant?

16:51.468 --> 16:54.505
I didn't want
to disappoint you.

16:54.571 --> 16:57.641
And I didn't want you
to judge me.

16:57.708 --> 16:59.677
Who's the father?

17:00.844 --> 17:02.813
His name is Bob.

17:04.448 --> 17:07.084
Where'd you meet him?

17:07.151 --> 17:12.122
Well, I've been doing
clerical work in an office
along storrow drive.

17:14.023 --> 17:16.359
When the weather's nice,
I like to eat my lunch...

17:16.426 --> 17:18.962
along the Charles river,
near the Hatch.

17:19.029 --> 17:23.666
There was a group
from Emerson college
playing chamber music there.

17:23.733 --> 17:27.338
<i>Quartet K. 465 by mozart,</i>

17:27.404 --> 17:29.640
<i>sunrise by Haydn.</i>

17:29.707 --> 17:34.044
Do you know
those quartets?
No. I'm afraid not.

17:34.111 --> 17:36.013
They're lovely.

17:37.314 --> 17:39.316
And it was such
a beautiful day.

17:39.383 --> 17:43.587
There were children
and dogs and people
eating their lunch.

17:43.654 --> 17:46.023
Couples.

17:46.090 --> 17:49.293
The kind of day
that makes you feel happy
to be alive.

17:51.528 --> 17:54.932
And there was this man.

17:54.999 --> 17:57.668
Bob.
Yes.

17:57.735 --> 18:01.405
And he started
talking to me.

18:01.472 --> 18:03.974
We talked
about the music.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.710
He was very handsome
and charming,

18:06.777 --> 18:09.613
and he knew so much.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.648
He was very nice to me.

18:14.084 --> 18:16.887
I didn't go back to work
that afternoon.

18:18.422 --> 18:21.258
Are you still
seeing each other?

18:21.325 --> 18:24.028
No.

18:24.094 --> 18:27.398
Does he know that
you're pregnant?

18:27.464 --> 18:29.833
No.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.536
<i>Don't you think maybe
you ought to tell him?</i>

18:36.040 --> 18:38.342
He's gone.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.878
He doesn't live
in Boston.

18:45.616 --> 18:48.886
<i>[ doctor ]
ah, it's marked clearly there.
I can see it myself.</i>

18:48.952 --> 18:50.888
A little lower.
Yes.

18:50.954 --> 18:55.626
<i>[ woman on P.A. ]
Mr. George cook,
please return to your room.</i>

18:55.693 --> 18:59.096
Fried monosodium glutamate.
My favorite cuisine.

18:59.163 --> 19:01.632
So, you're
gonna eat that here
or you takin' it out?

19:01.699 --> 19:04.435
Well, I'm waiting
for Dr. Cavanero.
She's in with a patient.

19:04.501 --> 19:06.503
You must be Patrick.
Yeah.

19:06.570 --> 19:08.906
Wayne Fiscus, Annie's best
friend in the whole world.

19:08.972 --> 19:10.974
I'm sure she always
talks about me.

19:11.041 --> 19:13.510
As a matter of fact,
she hasn't.

19:13.577 --> 19:16.513
Well, so what's it like being
as big as all outdoors?
Good-Bye, Fiscus.

19:16.580 --> 19:19.083
You're not gonna invite me
to join you two for dinner?

19:19.149 --> 19:23.487
Moo Goo Gai pan is, like,
my favorite Dish.
Good-Bye, Fiscus.

19:23.554 --> 19:26.390
That guy--
He didn't seem like
that bad a guy to me.

19:26.457 --> 19:29.293
Believe me, if you knew him--
No, you don't want to know him.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.363
They don't deliver
the insulin without
a green sheet, loceff!

19:32.429 --> 19:34.431
Loceff is
with Martha Mulvahey.

19:34.498 --> 19:37.568
Skilling
took that call.
That was ages ago.

19:37.634 --> 19:41.038
You've gotta talk
to Martha.
I thought I just did.

19:41.105 --> 19:43.107
Have you heard the news?
What?

19:43.173 --> 19:45.275
Dr. Westphall Heard
from Atlanta.

19:45.342 --> 19:47.611
It is
legionnaires' disease.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.482
[ sighs ]

19:54.585 --> 19:57.287
Dr. Westphall,
could you tell us
the steps you're taking...

19:57.354 --> 19:59.857
to locate the source
of the legionnaires'?

19:59.923 --> 20:03.927
Yes. Well, the monitoring team
from the center for disease
control in Atlanta--

20:03.994 --> 20:07.331
for this I have to miss
Ethel and Lucy?

20:07.398 --> 20:10.668
Hey, what are you
doing here tonight?
I thought you were off.

20:10.734 --> 20:14.838
You're right.
Tonight's my wife's birthday.
I better get going.

20:17.975 --> 20:19.977
Domestic tranquillity.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.979
They'll
get it together.
Yeah.

20:23.814 --> 20:26.216
A little higher
toward the Skull.
Shh.

20:26.283 --> 20:29.219
<i>Once you've located
the disease, then you'll
be able to eliminate it?</i>

20:29.286 --> 20:31.221
Yes, that's right.

20:31.288 --> 20:34.758
I would like to offer a word
of praise for my colleagues
at st. Eligius.

20:34.825 --> 20:38.162
They've performed extremely well
in a very difficult situation,

20:38.228 --> 20:41.131
and I'd really like them to know
how proud of them I am.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.634
[ Reporter ]
Thank you very much, doctor.
You bet ya.

20:43.701 --> 20:47.404
<i>[ reporter ]
so here at st. Eligius hospital,
the prognosis is Good.</i>

20:47.471 --> 20:50.274
<i>The situation
is under control for now.</i>

20:50.341 --> 20:54.111
<i>This is Larry fishkin for wffp.
Back to you, Irv.</i>

20:56.947 --> 21:00.351
Hey, Armstrong.
How's Craig doing
selling the car?

21:00.417 --> 21:02.753
Still Nothing.

21:02.820 --> 21:05.789
Well, don't worry.
Someone will come along
pretty soon.

21:10.661 --> 21:12.863
Talk about
an anticlimax.

21:12.930 --> 21:15.933
If we'd known earlier,
a couple of people still
would have been alive.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.337
- And you wouldn't have had
to blame it all on skilling.
- Thanks.

21:21.372 --> 21:23.941
Hey, pal,
I'm not the heavy.

21:24.008 --> 21:26.110
Sorry
to bother you again.

21:26.176 --> 21:28.412
It's the Fifth time
tonight, Martha.

21:28.479 --> 21:31.482
Believe me, I would prefer
to be able to turn
the faucet on myself--

21:31.548 --> 21:33.450
Fine.

21:34.885 --> 21:37.221
<i>[ water Running ]
thank you.</i>

21:37.287 --> 21:41.859
Do me a favor.
Let the water run for 20 minutes
until I get off shift.

21:43.761 --> 21:48.632
Mrs. Stephens,
I don't think your
daughter-In-Law is a witch.

21:50.868 --> 21:53.971
<i>You saw it levitate?</i>

21:54.038 --> 21:57.441
Well, perhaps it was
an optical illusion.

21:57.508 --> 21:59.743
<i>[ Knocking ]
yeah?</i>

22:02.413 --> 22:05.649
Still need a ride?
No, no. No, I'm gonna
get a ride with Samuels.

22:05.716 --> 22:08.819
Miss Stephens, can you
hang on just a second?
I'm gonna put you on hold.

22:08.886 --> 22:10.821
I'll be right back.

22:10.888 --> 22:13.891
I, uh--
I caught your show
on television.

22:13.957 --> 22:16.960
Just when you thought
it was safe to come back
into the hospital.

22:17.027 --> 22:20.230
It'll all blow over.
Some people would differ
with you on that one.

22:20.297 --> 22:23.300
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
some people would.

22:23.367 --> 22:27.738
- Donald, Jane sondell's
back in the hospital.
- Who?

22:27.805 --> 22:30.974
- Tweety.
- Oh, yes.

22:31.041 --> 22:33.077
Does she still think
she's a bird?

22:33.143 --> 22:35.879
No, I think she's
in complete control
of herself...

22:35.946 --> 22:38.682
and knows exactly
what she's doing.

22:38.749 --> 22:42.286
She's pregnant
by a guy named Bob.

22:42.353 --> 22:45.255
She spent one very
passionate afternoon...

22:45.322 --> 22:47.324
in the arms
of a total stranger,

22:47.391 --> 22:49.393
and now she's
three months' pregnant.

22:49.460 --> 22:54.465
<i>The problem is,
she's only been out of here
for two months.</i>

22:54.531 --> 22:57.234
Somebody stole the cookies
from the cookie jar.

22:57.301 --> 22:59.303
Oh, boy.

22:59.370 --> 23:02.039
Well, I'm sure
you'll find out who it is.
Good night, Hugh.

23:02.106 --> 23:05.442
Good night.
Why don't you go get a beer
with me and Samuels?

23:05.509 --> 23:08.312
You look like
you could use one.
That bad, is it?

23:08.379 --> 23:10.414
No, I can't. Thanks.
I gotta get home.

23:10.481 --> 23:13.250
It's my son's birthday
Tomorrow. Gonna hang
all the decorations.

23:13.317 --> 23:16.954
Thanks anyway.
Donald. Don't let this stuff
get you down.

23:17.021 --> 23:20.891
As coach Bum Phillips
once said of Earl Campbell,

23:20.958 --> 23:23.961
"you may not be
the only one in your class,

23:24.028 --> 23:26.764
but it sure wouldn't
take long to call roll."

23:26.830 --> 23:29.933
Thanks, Pal.
See you later.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.503
See you.

23:32.569 --> 23:35.239
[ sighs ]

23:35.305 --> 23:37.641
now, mrs. Stephens?

23:38.742 --> 23:40.744
Here you go.
Thanks.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.685
Okay.
Uh, Willie Andrews?

23:49.186 --> 23:52.322
I see.
The strong, silent type.
And, uh, you're--

23:54.358 --> 23:57.461
What's it to ya?
That's slavic,
isn't it?

23:57.528 --> 23:59.496
Let's look at the goods.

24:04.668 --> 24:07.771
Oh, nice job.
Somebody mistake you for
a thanksgiving turkey?

24:07.838 --> 24:10.107
Hey, look, man.
You gonna fix it or what?

24:10.174 --> 24:14.378
Sure. Wouldn't want you to be
late for that meeting with your
lawyers over the book rights.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.984
[ Whispers ]
Hey.

24:24.021 --> 24:27.057

Wake up. Jack boy.

24:27.124 --> 24:29.994

Rise and shine.

24:30.060 --> 24:32.096
What time is it?

24:32.162 --> 24:34.398
It's a quarter to 2:00.

24:35.632 --> 24:37.601
Why are you here?

24:39.436 --> 24:41.405
I've come
to relieve you.

24:42.773 --> 24:45.109
You've filled in for me
so many times,

24:45.175 --> 24:48.979
and I just happened to be
in the neighborhood anyway.

24:51.215 --> 24:53.117
What happened?

24:55.753 --> 24:58.856
- You had a fight.
- Right.

25:01.659 --> 25:04.495
What about?

25:04.561 --> 25:08.065
She didn't like the present
I got her for her birthday.
What'd you get her?

25:08.132 --> 25:11.268
A box of chocolates.

25:11.335 --> 25:14.271
Man, if we hadn't fought
about that, we would've fought
about something else.

25:14.338 --> 25:19.209
It's getting to the point
we don't even need a reason
to fight. We just fight.

25:19.276 --> 25:21.278
Tonight I tried.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.814
Listen, tonight
I really tried not to.

25:27.751 --> 25:30.120
I'm sorry.

25:30.187 --> 25:32.089
Yeah, me too.

25:34.425 --> 25:37.861
Okay. Whatever you do,
don't get it wet, okay?

25:37.928 --> 25:40.230
No swimming,
no snorkeling.

25:40.297 --> 25:43.100
No showers.
Take a bath.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.868
Please.

25:44.935 --> 25:46.870
It's a--
It's a joke.

25:46.937 --> 25:51.575
I feel like henny Youngman
playing a house full
of ayatollahs.

25:51.642 --> 25:55.579
All right.
Come back in 10 days, and
I'll take out the stitches.

25:55.646 --> 25:57.748
In the immortal words
of Dr. Seuss--

25:59.717 --> 26:02.953
Get his wallet!
Come on, come on!

26:06.623 --> 26:09.126
<i>[ Ehrlich ]
so what'd the cops say?</i>

26:09.193 --> 26:13.130
<i>[ Fiscus ] they, uh,
suggested I get another
wallet as soon as possible.</i>

26:13.197 --> 26:15.366
<i>[ Armstrong ]
what did they get?</i>

26:15.432 --> 26:19.003
<i>Nine bucks,
three 15Â¢ stamps,</i>

26:19.069 --> 26:21.105
<i>a picture
of Gracie slick...</i>

26:21.171 --> 26:25.209
and the number I got off a girl
I met last thursday night
at faneuil Hall.

26:29.346 --> 26:31.281
Special family blend?

26:31.348 --> 26:35.486
It will make you feel like,
um-- how do they say?

26:35.552 --> 26:38.622
A new man?

26:38.689 --> 26:42.660
Why not?
If I felt any worse,
I'd be dead.

26:42.726 --> 26:45.562
If I felt any better,
it wouldn't be me.

26:45.629 --> 26:48.165
Josh karton,
the technician
over at the V.A.?

26:48.232 --> 26:50.734
he got mugged
while taking a set
of x-Rays.

26:50.801 --> 26:53.804
In berkeley, three dudes
on harleys came after me
with tire irons...

26:53.871 --> 26:56.674
because I revived a guy
from a rival bike gang.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.542
You're lucky.
Me?

26:58.609 --> 27:00.844
All your patients
are out cold.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.646
[ laughing ]

27:02.713 --> 27:05.249
such a headache.

27:05.315 --> 27:07.351
Go home,
get some rest.

27:07.418 --> 27:11.855
I can't.
I gotta go downtown
and look at mug Shots.

27:13.957 --> 27:16.794
Watch it, will you?
Hey!

27:16.860 --> 27:21.432
Not barnes. Barnum. "Um."
a deaf switchboard operator.

27:21.498 --> 27:24.001
Any sign of Mr. Schultz's
white Blood count yet?

27:24.068 --> 27:27.971
I'll send for it.
We got a postcard
from Dr. Auschlander.

27:28.038 --> 27:30.174
That's nice.
What's it say?

27:30.240 --> 27:34.745
Either I need glasses
or it's totally Illegible.
Want to try translating?

27:34.812 --> 27:39.583
"Cabo San Lucas is a dream.
Don't wake me up. Best to all."
It's an acquired skill.

27:41.819 --> 27:44.588
You ever work with
a Dr. Pat Barnum?
No.

27:44.655 --> 27:46.657
I've been waiting
three hours.

27:46.724 --> 27:50.427
I got a message from him.
Nobody can find him!
Maybe he's at another Hospital.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.429
Get me Boston General.

27:52.496 --> 27:55.499
Helen, I'm sorry, but I'm
not gonna let Martha mulvahey
run me ragged today.

27:55.566 --> 27:57.501
God, what is it now?
I don't know.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.406
Yes, Martha.
What is it?

28:02.473 --> 28:06.477
I know I'm being a terrible
bother, but I'd really like
to get my hair washed.

28:06.543 --> 28:09.880
We washed it yesterday.
I know,
but it feels dirty.

28:09.947 --> 28:12.616
Listen, honey, there are
45 new beds in this ward.

28:12.683 --> 28:16.186
It's very crowded,
and Everybody's very tired.

28:16.253 --> 28:18.922
I wouldn't even ask,
but I can't do it myself.

28:18.989 --> 28:22.026
Martha, it's gonna take
at least 40 minutes for someone
to wash your hair.

28:22.092 --> 28:24.695
We can't possibly wash
every Patient's hair
every day.

28:24.762 --> 28:28.599
There's just too much to do
and not enough of us
to do it all.

28:28.666 --> 28:32.002
You're right.
I'm sorry.

28:32.069 --> 28:36.674
Since I've been sick,
I can't even do
the simplest things myself.

28:36.740 --> 28:40.344
I promise
I won't be such a bother
to everybody Anymore.

28:40.411 --> 28:43.013
Look, things are
pretty hectic right now,

28:43.080 --> 28:45.249
but I'll get back
within the hour.

28:45.315 --> 28:47.951
We'll get your hair washed.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.888
I think
it's an inside job.
Doesn't make sense.

28:50.954 --> 28:55.492
There's no money in it.
$6,000 worth of supplies
is not exactly Petty cash.

28:55.559 --> 28:58.062
It is when you consider that
one tab of methaqualone...

28:58.128 --> 29:00.130
goes for eight bucks
on the street.

29:00.197 --> 29:03.033
If you were feeding
the black market, would you
lift tongue depressors?

29:03.100 --> 29:06.103
That's a good point.
You better send Cummings
a tally sheet.

29:06.170 --> 29:08.439
I did. He will not
okay the payments.

29:08.505 --> 29:10.674
All right.
I'll talk to him.
Thanks.

29:10.741 --> 29:15.546
Okay, sweetie. Don't cry.
I'll get you another I.D.
Just as soon as I can.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.882
What do you mean
Dr. Barnum called again?

29:18.949 --> 29:23.754
All the message said was,
Dr. Barnum wants to talk to you
about buying your car.

29:23.821 --> 29:25.756
Did he leave
a phone number?
Nope.

29:25.823 --> 29:28.359
[ shouting ]
why the hell didn't he
leave his phone number?

29:28.425 --> 29:31.261
Rooney, how many times
have I got to tell you?

29:31.328 --> 29:34.164
I'm the doctor.
You're the orderly, okay?

29:34.231 --> 29:37.634
You do not-- underline--
Do not have legionnaires'.
you understand?

29:37.701 --> 29:40.938
What do you call this?
It's a Rash about
the size of my fist.

29:41.005 --> 29:44.508
Yeah, that's a Rash.
Yeah.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.977
Sometimes--
Sometimes,

29:47.044 --> 29:49.113
when you get real nervous,

29:49.179 --> 29:51.882
your skin reacts
because your mind is busy
with other things.

29:51.949 --> 29:54.718
Understand?
No.

29:54.785 --> 29:58.322
Well, you're not sick.
Trust me.

30:00.691 --> 30:03.794
So, okay, maybe I ain't
got legionnaires' disease.
Maybe I got something worse.

30:03.861 --> 30:06.230
Maybe something you guys
ain't even discovered yet!

30:06.296 --> 30:11.301
Come on, you monster!
Where is miss Muscarella's
chemical profile?

30:11.368 --> 30:13.537
Luther!
Where have you been?

30:13.604 --> 30:16.306
Well, I was here,
and I was over--
Oh, come on, Luther.

30:16.373 --> 30:19.777
Dr. Beale wants
to see you pronto.
And come right back.

30:19.843 --> 30:23.414
Move it!
Dr. Pat Barnum.
Check it again!

30:23.480 --> 30:26.216
And Keep checking
till you find him!

30:26.283 --> 30:28.786
The patients in 435 signed
a petition complaining...

30:28.852 --> 30:31.455
about the paint peeling off
the wall in their bathroom.

30:31.522 --> 30:34.391
Ohh! File it.

30:34.458 --> 30:38.128
No! No wonder they
call this a terminal.

30:38.195 --> 30:40.264
<i>[ files hit floor ]
oh!</i>

30:40.331 --> 30:43.167
Oh! God!

30:43.233 --> 30:45.836
So, where do we start,
Dr. Borovay?

30:45.903 --> 30:48.772
<i>The organism could be localized
in these showers here,</i>

30:48.839 --> 30:52.776
or the faucets,
or the BED pan flushers.

30:52.843 --> 30:54.945
It's the needle
in the haystack.

30:55.012 --> 30:58.415
The legionnaires', uh,
they found at Wadsworth V.A.
In california...

30:58.482 --> 31:00.417
and bellvue-Stratford...

31:00.484 --> 31:02.619
was traced to
the air-Conditioning system,
right?

31:02.686 --> 31:07.691
Yes. I had another case
in Michigan where we found it
in the storage tanks.

31:07.758 --> 31:11.929
But because the Outbreak here
has been limited
to only one ward,

31:11.996 --> 31:14.298
it probably originated
in that ward.

31:14.365 --> 31:19.203
Samples will be obtained
by Swabbing each water outlet
with a dacron swab.

31:19.269 --> 31:22.873
<i>If the point of origin
is not found
to be on that ward,</i>

31:22.940 --> 31:25.976
then the organisms
are ubiquitous...

31:26.043 --> 31:29.113
<i>and the entire
water-Distribution system is
irreconcilably contaminated.</i>

31:29.179 --> 31:30.981
What would that mean?

31:31.048 --> 31:34.818
It would mean that
the entire hospital would
have to be closed down.

31:34.885 --> 31:38.655
<i>Don't worry. We'll find it.
The most important thing is
that you acted quickly.</i>

31:38.722 --> 31:40.858
You should both
be congratulated.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.328
<i>[ Whistling ]
[ knocking ]</i>

31:44.395 --> 31:48.766
looking for me?
Ah, Luther, indeed I am.
Come in. Come in.

31:49.833 --> 31:52.670
Luther,
I've got a problem.

31:52.736 --> 31:57.107
Yeah?
And I think maybe
you can help me out.

31:57.174 --> 31:59.109
What's the problem?

31:59.176 --> 32:03.247
Do you remember a patient
of mine from a while back
by the name of Jane?

32:03.313 --> 32:05.983
She was the girl
with bird Tendencies.

32:06.050 --> 32:09.353
Yeah, sure.
She was hooked on
sunflower Seeds.

32:09.420 --> 32:12.289
Yeah, right.
Well, she's pregnant.

32:12.356 --> 32:16.427
And the problem is,
I think she was impregnated
by someone in this hospital.

32:16.493 --> 32:18.929
Oh, no, doc.
I swear I wouldn't--

32:18.996 --> 32:21.865
I know it wasn't you, Luther.
But I need your help.

32:21.932 --> 32:23.867
My help?

32:23.934 --> 32:27.338
Luther, I've been affiliated
with this hospital
for several years.

32:27.404 --> 32:32.343
During that time,
I have come to know
its informational flow.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.411
Know what I mean?

32:34.478 --> 32:36.413
No.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.415
Ah. Well.

32:38.482 --> 32:42.152
When you need help
with a personal problem,
you go to Dr. Westphall.

32:42.219 --> 32:45.889
When you need
to get something done,
you go to nurse Rosenthal.

32:45.956 --> 32:48.959
But when you need to get
right down to the dirt,

32:49.026 --> 32:53.697
you go to the eyes
and the ears
of this hospital.

32:53.764 --> 32:55.899
Whoa, doc. What you're
asking me to do...

32:55.966 --> 32:59.536
is to snoop and sneak and pry
in other people's business.

32:59.603 --> 33:02.172
Fifty dollars.
I'll ask around.

33:09.446 --> 33:12.116
[ knocking ]

33:12.182 --> 33:14.852
phone.
The computer man.
Great.

33:14.918 --> 33:17.054
<i>I'm sorry,
but we don't launder
personal Clothing.</i>

33:17.121 --> 33:19.056
That's why we provide
the hospital Gowns.

33:19.123 --> 33:23.360
Uh, mrs. Allen, 413--
She get her metolazone?
Not yet, doctor.

33:23.427 --> 33:25.396
What's the hang-up?

33:27.698 --> 33:31.201
Has mrs. O'Flaherty
gone to Beth zion too?
My diabetic hypertensive?

33:31.268 --> 33:34.738
Jerry, the last time
it broke down, you said it
would never break down again.

33:34.805 --> 33:36.874
Stop right there, Luther!

33:36.940 --> 33:40.944
I did call
our Main computer Office.
Rosalie told me to call you.

33:41.011 --> 33:43.614
I thought I told you
to come right back!
This is right back!

33:43.681 --> 33:46.350
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it
from you either.

33:46.417 --> 33:49.520
What do you mean
you're not responsible
every time it breaks down?

33:49.586 --> 33:53.624
The man in 411
with a peptic ulcer
erupted again.

33:53.691 --> 33:58.362
Yeah. It doesn't get any more
cruel or unusual punishment
than the rest of us do.

33:58.429 --> 34:00.798
You can say that again.
I am tired of excuses.

34:00.864 --> 34:03.367
I want it working,
and I want it working now.

34:03.434 --> 34:05.469
Mrs. Visser wants a vase
for her flowers.

34:05.536 --> 34:08.105
I've got an ASSIGNMENT
from Dr. Beale.
Assignment?

34:08.172 --> 34:10.873
Yeah.
tomorrow? Oh, Jerry.

34:10.940 --> 34:13.944
I'm glad you're not
in front of me right now.

34:14.011 --> 34:17.181
412 again?
Martha Mulvahey.

34:17.246 --> 34:20.184
[ sighs ]
fix it, Jerry, fast!

34:20.250 --> 34:22.518
Luther?
Flowers! Ulcer!

34:22.585 --> 34:26.290
Do you want me
to get the call?
No. I'll go.

34:26.357 --> 34:28.292
What is it, Martha?

34:28.359 --> 34:30.293
I'm sorry
to bother you.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.397
You said that the last time
and the time before.
What is it now?

34:33.464 --> 34:35.532
I have a friend
coming to see me.

34:35.599 --> 34:38.735
Could you help me
with my makeup?
Your makeup?

34:40.504 --> 34:43.440
First it was the Pillow,
then the bed, then your hair
needed washing.

34:43.507 --> 34:45.641
<i>No more.
Do you understand?
No more!</i>

34:45.708 --> 34:49.813
What do you think
we do around here?
This isn't a country club.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.915
<i>Now, look, Martha.</i>

34:51.982 --> 34:55.018
I am very sorry
that you've got arthritis,
and I mean that.

34:55.085 --> 34:57.087
<i>I'm very sorry that this
happened to you.</i>

34:57.154 --> 34:59.156
<i>You're sick, and I know
that it's hard for you,</i>

34:59.223 --> 35:02.259
but we cannot cater
to your every need.

35:02.326 --> 35:05.329
You are not the only patient
in this hospital.

35:05.396 --> 35:08.932
If you keep calling like this,
no one will respond when
it's really important.

35:08.999 --> 35:13.170
<i>Do you understand?
When it is really important!</i>

35:15.439 --> 35:18.909
Ramon Lopez
gave you a voucher.
I need you to sign it.

35:18.976 --> 35:21.311
I'm afraid that's
out of the question.

35:21.378 --> 35:24.214
That's great.
So we run out of band-Aids
and cotton swabs.

35:24.281 --> 35:26.216
What do you suggest
we do then?

35:26.283 --> 35:29.286
As is hospital policy,
you will be reimbursed
for 90% of full value...

35:29.353 --> 35:31.288
At the start
of the next fiscal Quarter.

35:31.355 --> 35:34.124
Then free the
supplemental allocation.
What supplemental allocation?

35:34.191 --> 35:36.193
You know damn well
what it is.
Was.

35:36.260 --> 35:40.431
Our contingency Monies
were spent on this fiasco.
I see.

35:40.497 --> 35:43.500
So you're gonna
withhold the money to punish me
for shutting down that ward.

35:43.567 --> 35:47.237
That's not it at all.
If I had been wrong, I could
understand your resentment.

35:47.304 --> 35:52.309
But I wasn't wrong.
This hospital averted what could
have been a major epidemic.

35:52.376 --> 35:54.712
You've done a hell
of a job, Donald.

35:54.778 --> 35:59.283
I hope other people remember
what a good job you've done
seven months down the line...

35:59.350 --> 36:02.186
when we don't have the money
for the new Cat scan...

36:02.252 --> 36:04.755
or we lose our backing from
the zellman foundation...

36:04.822 --> 36:08.092
all because of
the terrific job
you've done.

36:08.158 --> 36:10.694
Fund-Raising has never
been one of st. Eligius's...

36:13.831 --> 36:15.799
Boston General
and bent Brigham--

36:15.866 --> 36:18.435
They usually get first crack
at the heavy hitters.

36:18.502 --> 36:20.838
Notoriety does not
inspire confidence.

36:20.904 --> 36:22.906
And we could have avoided
the notoriety...

36:22.973 --> 36:27.978
if we just kept
the NEWS quiet Until the C.D.C.
Had made the final Report.

36:28.045 --> 36:32.016
C.D.C. Reports
don't make headlines.

36:32.082 --> 36:35.552

make the evening news.

a Dr. Barnum?
Don't think so.

He's not here or
at Boston General...

37:03.781 --> 37:05.816

Is your back
bothering you again?

37:08.452 --> 37:10.921
No, my car.
I've been trying
to sell it for weeks.

a new one for her birthday.
We don't need three cars!

Do you happen know a physician
named Pat Barnum?
Male or female?

37:18.195 --> 37:22.032
Good question.
Open your mouth, Mr. Collins.
It's time to take your pill.

37:22.099 --> 37:26.003
I'm not kidding.
I'm gonna stand right here
until I see you swallow it.

37:26.070 --> 37:28.072
What seems to be
the problem?

37:28.138 --> 37:31.141
Nothing I can't handle.
Take your pill,
Mr. Collins.

in my room anyhow? Huh?
Don't push! Please don't!</i>

if you want to get better,
you gotta take your pill.

I heard about what happened.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Sure.

38:03.307 --> 38:05.876
I remember after
the first couple of times
I got mugged,

38:05.943 --> 38:08.078
I began to think
it was my fault.

38:08.145 --> 38:11.482
You start lookin'
over your shoulder
a whole lot more.

38:11.548 --> 38:13.650
Yeah, I guess so.

38:13.717 --> 38:17.621
It's good to see you.
Well, uh,
it's good to be seen.

38:19.023 --> 38:22.526
If there's anything I can do
for you, let me know.

38:23.661 --> 38:26.163
Thanks.

38:38.008 --> 38:39.910

38:43.947 --> 38:46.617
Did you have a nice visit
with your friend?

38:46.684 --> 38:49.953
I overheard
two of the nurses
talking about me,

38:50.020 --> 38:52.022
<i>trying to be nice.</i>

38:52.089 --> 38:55.726
"Well, she's got
pretty hair."

38:55.793 --> 38:58.495
Pretty hair.

38:58.562 --> 39:01.498
Oh, god.

39:01.565 --> 39:04.535
For the past six years
it's been getting worse
and worse.

39:07.771 --> 39:11.709
I can't even turn
the pages of a book.

39:11.775 --> 39:13.677
I am so angry!

39:17.648 --> 39:20.517

39:28.692 --> 39:31.862
I don't want him
to see me like this.

39:31.929 --> 39:33.831
He's not going to.

39:48.979 --> 39:53.550
We are going to make you
look so beautiful.

39:53.617 --> 39:57.621
Mark, I just spent $600
on a new transmission.

Well, what am I
supposed to do?

40:00.557 --> 40:02.960
Buy American.

40:03.027 --> 40:05.029
Why don't you
buy his car?

40:05.095 --> 40:07.031
My Uncle Jimbo
once said,

40:07.097 --> 40:11.168
"never buy anything
from a man who could
someday operate on you."

40:11.235 --> 40:14.171
Besides,
some guy named Barnum
wants to buy it.

40:14.238 --> 40:16.173
No, he doesn't.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.609

40:18.676 --> 40:20.644

for getting the money to cover
those stolen supplies.

41:51.702 --> 41:55.272
As it turns out,
we recovered most of them.
They were, uh, misplaced.

Could be a long winter.

42:00.611 --> 42:04.882
I, uh, thought about
what you said.

42:04.948 --> 42:07.951
It seems it's easy to forget
that our objectives
are the same.

42:08.018 --> 42:11.221
It's just that
you and I go at them
from different angles.

42:11.288 --> 42:14.958
I want you to know that
any differences I had with you
in the past are not personal.

42:15.025 --> 42:17.428
The root of the problem
is SIMPLE:

42:17.494 --> 42:21.432
Running this hospital,
making it work,
is a business.

42:21.498 --> 42:23.801
But to you doctors,
it's a calling.

42:23.867 --> 42:26.403
You'd rather remove yourselves
from the business of medicine,

42:26.470 --> 42:30.741
<i>from the pedestrian,
daily, mundane work.</i>

42:30.808 --> 42:33.043
The business of medicine
is business.

42:33.110 --> 42:34.945
Something like that.

42:36.647 --> 42:39.483
I realize this whole thing has
caused you enormous problems.

42:39.550 --> 42:41.685
I wouldn't worry about it.

What's this?

42:46.757 --> 42:48.759
Your resume.

42:48.826 --> 42:52.763
When an institution
fails to function smoothly,
someone's gotta take a fall.

42:52.830 --> 42:56.233
The administrator
is a likely candidate.

42:56.300 --> 42:58.202
Oh, they won't fire you.

43:00.904 --> 43:04.675
A vote of confidence is usually
a good indication that a change
is about to take place.

43:04.742 --> 43:09.046
Knowing the board,
they'll wait until the C.D.C.
Releases its report,

43:09.113 --> 43:11.115
till the heat dies down.

43:11.181 --> 43:15.185
Maybe they'll hold off
until the annual convention
in Chicago-- Whatever.

43:15.252 --> 43:19.490
But... I will be replaced.

43:24.662 --> 43:26.964

No.

It happens more often
than it should.

of a hospital are a poor excuse
for missing a birthday party,

be the brightest person

was time taken away from me.

to happen to my own children.
