LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

00:27.070 --> 00:28.180
SEASON VI
EPISODE 6

00:28.240 --> 00:31.140
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

00:31.180 --> 00:34.020
I'm John Oliver,
thank you for joining us.

00:34.040 --> 00:37.240
A quick recap of the week,
a busy one for the administration,

00:38.010 --> 00:41.030
from Trump's attacks
on the Affordable Healthcare Act,

00:41.060 --> 00:45.030
to his threats to close the southern
border, to Bernhardt's hearing.

00:45.050 --> 00:47.220
He is Trump's pick for
Secretary of the Interior

00:47.240 --> 00:50.160
and a former oil lobbyist,
so he's pretty swampy,

00:50.180 --> 00:56.030
which some activists drew attention
to, as you'll see over his shoulder.

00:56.100 --> 00:58.220
I have worked with many of you
and your staff.

00:59.020 --> 01:01.210
I have met with many of you
in person, and by phone,

01:01.860 --> 01:04.010
on various issues that were
of a concern to you

01:04.030 --> 01:07.840
and I will always make myself
available to your requests.

01:08.010 --> 01:11.920
Yeah! Nicely done. That woman
in the mask was there for a while.

01:11.950 --> 01:15.910
Because ten minutes later?
Still there. 20 minutes? Still there!

01:15.980 --> 01:20.060
45 minutes? Still there!
An hour later? Still there!

01:20.900 --> 01:24.930
It is pretty funny, although,
I would not be doing my job

01:24.950 --> 01:27.910
if I didn't point out
that this is a "swamp creature"

01:27.930 --> 01:31.840
and technically what she's wearing
is a "lagoon creature" mask,

01:31.860 --> 01:34.000
and that distinction
might not mean much to you

01:34.020 --> 01:38.060
but in the aquatic goblin communities,
confusing the two is pretty racist.

01:38.860 --> 01:42.080
This week was dominated by
the fallout from the Mueller Report.

01:42.850 --> 01:46.960
William Barr submitted this
summary of its contents to Congress.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.010
The investigation did not establish
that members of the Trump campaign

01:51.050 --> 01:54.030
conspired or coordinated
with Russian government

01:54.050 --> 01:56.910
in its election
interference activities.

01:56.930 --> 01:59.070
When it comes
to the question of obstruction,

01:59.840 --> 02:02.970
Barr said Mueller did not have
enough evidence to prosecute

02:03.380 --> 02:05.530
but could not
exonerate the president.

02:06.390 --> 02:11.420
Report did not establish a conspiracy
between Russia and Trump's campaign,

02:11.440 --> 02:14.370
which is undeniably
good news for the president.

02:14.390 --> 02:17.580
The fact that Mueller did not exonerate
him on obstruction of justice

02:17.600 --> 02:19.430
is pretty remarkable.

02:19.450 --> 02:21.400
It might
prompt headlines like:

02:21.420 --> 02:23.530
"President May Have
Obstructed Justice."

02:24.370 --> 02:25.590
Which is why it's been weird
to see

02:26.360 --> 02:29.550
the good news for the president
often shoving aside the bad.

02:30.410 --> 02:32.560
The O.J. Simpson murders were
not reported as:

02:32.580 --> 02:35.580
"Affordable House
Becomes Available In Brentwood."

02:35.600 --> 02:39.430
There's something pretty big
missing from that headline.

02:39.490 --> 02:41.520
All week, the president's supporters

02:41.540 --> 02:44.460
took their one good news
and rounded it up to two.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.580
No collusion.
No obstruction of justice.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.550
No obstruction, no collusion.

02:48.570 --> 02:52.440
No collusion,
no obstruction, nothing.

02:52.500 --> 02:56.360
Victorious, exonerated,
vindicated.

02:56.430 --> 02:59.420
Trump was not
completely exonerated.

02:59.440 --> 03:03.470
The report literally used the words
"does not exonerate him."

03:03.930 --> 03:08.800
Mueller could have been clearer
is if he put hand clap emojis

03:08.820 --> 03:09.900
between every word.

03:09.990 --> 03:15.000
Normally this is where we would
do a deep dive into the details,

03:15.020 --> 03:18.810
explaining all the possible
implications.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.940
The problem is...
We still haven't seen it.

03:20.970 --> 03:24.040
Congress hasn't seen it.
Even the president hasn't seen it.

03:24.820 --> 03:27.970
We know what Trump's own attorney
general thinks we need to know,

03:27.990 --> 03:31.020
a man who, unsolicited
and before he got his current job,

03:31.040 --> 03:35.030
sent top DOJ officials a memo ruling
out obstruction of justice charges

03:35.800 --> 03:36.900
against the president.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.950
There are plenty of qualifiers
and questions left here,

03:39.970 --> 03:43.020
it's strange to see Trump's
supporters saying this.

03:43.860 --> 03:48.840
One year, 10 months and six days.
$40 million of taxpayer money wasted.

03:48.880 --> 03:49.940
It was all a waste.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.040
How did we ever waste
two years of America on this?

03:53.810 --> 03:56.940
All the Democrats yakking,
billions of hours of hot air

03:56.960 --> 03:58.890
coming out of Democrat mouths.

03:58.910 --> 04:02.800
All they got for it was this t-shirt.
They got nothing out of it.

04:02.820 --> 04:07.890
If there's one authority figure I trust
on free shirts, it's gonna be that man.

04:08.200 --> 04:12.200
There is no way actual U.S. currency
was exchanged for that outfit.

04:12.230 --> 04:15.350
He's dressed like a personal-injury
attorney whose portrait

04:15.370 --> 04:19.240
just got MeToo'ed off the wall
of an airport Palm steakhouse.

04:19.260 --> 04:23.160
DOJ could well take in more
than it spent on the investigation

04:23.180 --> 04:26.390
just in the form of asset forfeitures
from Paul Manafort alone.

04:27.160 --> 04:31.330
As we've said before, even if
the investigation didn't conclude

04:31.350 --> 04:35.320
Trump conspired with the Russians,
doesn't mean it was a waste of time.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.340
It's easy to forget how much
we've already learned,

04:38.360 --> 04:41.400
directly or indirectly, from
Mueller's investigation,

04:42.180 --> 04:44.370
as so much has slowly
trickled out over two years.

04:44.390 --> 04:48.280
Try and imagine
that it all came out at once,

04:48.310 --> 04:50.210
and a single headline said:

04:50.230 --> 04:53.190
"Russia Confirmed
To Have Interfered In Election"

04:53.210 --> 04:57.280
"And President's Campaign Manager,
Multiple Advisers Convicted Of Crimes"

04:57.300 --> 05:01.160
"And Trump And His Team Lied
About Business With Russia,"

05:01.190 --> 05:04.280
"And Trump May Have Committed
Campaign Finance Violations"

05:04.300 --> 05:08.240
"To Cover Up Affair With Adult Film
Star, After His Wife Gave Birth,"

05:08.500 --> 05:11.490
"And Which He Also Attempted
To Continue, But Ended Up"

05:11.510 --> 05:14.650
"Sitting Next To Her In A Hotel Room
And Watching "Shark Week.'"

05:14.670 --> 05:17.490
All of that happened,
and we know it,

05:17.530 --> 05:20.650
as a result
of Mueller's investigation.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.720
This scandal has been sitting
in plain sight for so long,

05:24.490 --> 05:25.640
we've stopped noticing it,

05:25.660 --> 05:28.690
much like a woman in an
increasingly-sweaty fish mask.

05:28.720 --> 05:33.560
The weirdest thing about this
situation is how somehow not-weird

05:33.580 --> 05:37.550
this objectively ridiculous state
of affairs is starting to feel.

05:37.570 --> 05:38.690
And now this.

05:39.650 --> 05:45.500
In Honor of Opening Day:
A Reminder From L.A.'s Vin Scully

05:45.520 --> 05:49.540
That Great Baseball Commentary
Doesn't Have To Be About Baseball.

05:49.670 --> 05:53.690
Looking at Clayton Kershaw's
uniform with all the dirt on it,

05:53.720 --> 05:58.550
it reminds us about the importance
of dirt to certain people.

05:58.630 --> 06:02.570
Beards evolved number one,
because ladies like them.

06:03.510 --> 06:08.640
It was the idea of frightening off
adversaries and wild animals.

06:09.220 --> 06:15.210
There's a story that redheads will
be extinct by the year 2060.

06:15.240 --> 06:19.330
There also seems to be a dispute
as to whether Betsy Ross

06:20.120 --> 06:24.160
ever lived in Philadelphia's
popular Betsy Ross Home.

06:24.260 --> 06:27.160
Just think about
how tough that rabbit was:

06:27.240 --> 06:31.330
first it gets eaten by a snake,
the snake gets chopped to pieces,

06:32.120 --> 06:34.350
then it gets picked up
by people and lives.

06:35.240 --> 06:39.150
Line drive base hit to center
by Hendrik

06:39.180 --> 06:41.160
and the Dodgers
are in business.

06:41.180 --> 06:43.150
First and second
and nobody out.

06:45.250 --> 06:50.170
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns professional wrestling.

06:50.190 --> 06:53.120
Literally the only good excuse
to wear a onesie.

06:53.140 --> 06:55.160
Babies,
you're not pulling it off.

06:55.180 --> 06:58.230
Put on some jeans and a button
down, like a fucking person.

06:59.240 --> 07:03.210
I want to talk about the undisputed
corporate champion of wrestling,

07:03.230 --> 07:07.270
the WWE, formerly known
as the WWF until, and this is true,

07:07.290 --> 07:10.230
they lost a court case to
the World Wildlife Fund,

07:10.590 --> 07:13.760
presumably thanks to that fund's
powerful team of panda lawyers.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.580
Before we go any further,
let me say this: I like wrestling.

07:18.610 --> 07:22.620
You might be surprised to hear that,
but it's objectively entertaining.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.760
The WWE has, over the years,
delivered numerous, ludicrous

07:25.780 --> 07:27.790
and genuinely incredible moments,

07:28.560 --> 07:32.570
from when Jake "The Snake" Roberts
set a live cobra on "Macho Man",

07:32.600 --> 07:36.760
to the time Strowman suplexed
the Big Show off the turnbuckle,

07:36.800 --> 07:40.700
to when "Stone Cold" Steve Austin
drove a beer truck into the arena

07:40.730 --> 07:43.610
and sprayed the corporation
with a beer hose,

07:43.630 --> 07:46.710
not to be mistaken with the time
Kurt Angle drove a milk truck

07:46.730 --> 07:49.740
and sprayed "Stone Cold"
Steve Austin with a milk hose.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.700
And whatever the fuck this is.

07:53.610 --> 07:54.700
My God, here we go!

07:55.760 --> 07:58.750
What's gonna happen?
Look out!

08:00.650 --> 08:02.700
My God!

08:04.590 --> 08:06.670
Everything about that
is fantastic.

08:06.780 --> 08:10.640
My favorite part is after
the table was lit on fire,

08:10.900 --> 08:13.100
the commentator asking:
"What's gonna happen?"

08:13.120 --> 08:17.020
What was he expecting to happen?
The table's on fire!

08:17.040 --> 08:22.010
Here comes a hibachi chef, and
he's making those onion volcanoes!

08:22.040 --> 08:25.880
Now he's doing
indoor s'mores! Oh my God!

08:27.100 --> 08:31.110
It is worth talking about the WWE
tonight, for multiple reasons.

08:31.890 --> 08:33.900
First,
it's astonishingly popular.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.000
It has over a billion
fans on social media,

08:36.020 --> 08:39.929
it has two highly-rated cable shows,
its own streaming network,

08:39.950 --> 08:43.010
reality shows, video games
and even a movie studio,

08:43.030 --> 08:46.920
which has produced hits as
"The Scorpion King", "Walking Tall",

08:46.940 --> 08:50.020
"The Marine", "The Marine 2",
"The Marine 3", "The Marine 4",

08:50.050 --> 08:53.120
"The Marine 5", "The Marine 6",
and, of course, "Lincoln".

08:53.970 --> 08:56.960
By the way, their first choice
to play Abraham Lincoln

08:56.980 --> 09:00.060
was Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake,
but he wasn't available,

09:00.080 --> 09:03.880
so the role went to Daniel Day-Lewis,
who was, he was fine.

09:03.980 --> 09:06.970
This company makes
a lot of money.

09:06.990 --> 09:10.920
Last year, it generated
a record $930 million in revenue.

09:11.060 --> 09:14.150
WrestleMania alone,
which is taking place next Sunday,

09:14.170 --> 09:17.190
is one of the most valuable
sports brands in the world,

09:17.210 --> 09:21.150
ranking higher than the World
Series, which actually makes sense,

09:21.170 --> 09:24.070
'cause while the World Series
is mostly spent

09:24.090 --> 09:27.160
watching a millionaire
think about whether to throw a ball,

09:27.180 --> 09:30.110
WrestleMania
involves things like this.

09:30.230 --> 09:32.160
No, oh my God.

09:33.190 --> 09:38.060
For the love of mankind. Shane
just exploded through our table.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.140
Are you not entertained?

09:41.100 --> 09:47.100
How could any other TV show top that?
I would argue every other show

09:47.120 --> 09:51.050
should be called "Not A Guy
Exploding Through A Table."

09:51.200 --> 09:54.160
And this show should be
very much included in that.

09:55.090 --> 09:58.100
The other reason that it's worth
talking about the WWE

09:58.120 --> 10:00.190
is the prevalence
of stories like these.

10:00.250 --> 10:04.040
Eddie Guerrero, found dead
in a Minneapolis hotel room.

10:04.060 --> 10:07.210
The World Wrestling star
was just 38 years old.

10:07.260 --> 10:11.240
We have just confirmed that
Randy "Macho Man" Savage has died.

10:11.890 --> 10:15.940
Chyna, one of the most famous
wrestlers in the 90's has now died.

10:15.970 --> 10:17.880
She was 46 years old.

10:17.920 --> 10:21.910
Pro wrestling legend "King Kong"
Bundy has died at the age of 61.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.930
He came here,
we were in Studio A.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.990
And he lifted me almost
to the ceiling.

10:26.010 --> 10:28.940
Just 61 years old,
these wrestlers dying early.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.080
That is a harrowing statement
from Brian Kilmeade,

10:32.850 --> 10:36.030
slightly dampened by his wonder
at how high the big man lifted him.

10:36.900 --> 10:40.080
Did Bundy offer him?
Did Kilmeade ask?

10:40.860 --> 10:44.040
I wouldn't be surprised if one
of his stock interview questions is:

10:44.070 --> 10:45.930
"Up! Up! Horsey ride!"

10:46.840 --> 10:48.040
Kilmeade is not wrong there.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.890
Wrestlers dying early
is a troubling trend.

10:51.920 --> 10:55.070
FiveThirtyEight tracked the rate
of deaths among WWF wrestlers

10:55.840 --> 10:56.990
and findings were startling.

10:57.010 --> 11:00.890
Here is the expected death rate
among the population as a whole.

11:00.910 --> 11:05.080
Here is the rate among former NFL
players. And here, among wrestlers.

11:05.850 --> 11:08.980
That is shockingly high! You'd
expect that line to be labeled:

11:09.000 --> 11:11.050
"Test Pilots
Who Lied On Their Resume"

11:11.070 --> 11:15.050
or "Zookeepers Who Aren't Gonna
Let Some Baboon Screech At Them."

11:15.710 --> 11:18.920
Enough sass-mouth, buddy!
Put some respect on my name!

11:20.790 --> 11:24.920
With that in mind, tonight,
a week ahead of WrestleMania,

11:25.690 --> 11:27.800
let's take a look
at how the WWE does business

11:27.820 --> 11:29.780
and how it treats its wrestlers.

11:29.800 --> 11:33.840
You can't talk about the WWE without
talking about its chairman and CEO,

11:33.860 --> 11:37.770
Vince McMahon, because he is
incredibly powerful, as you can see

11:37.800 --> 11:40.790
in this actual photo he took
for a fitness magazine:

11:40.810 --> 11:44.680
"Scary Grandpa Who Looks Like
A Big, Bumpy Hot Dog Quarterly."

11:44.760 --> 11:46.790
Vince bought the company
from his dad

11:46.810 --> 11:49.730
and has overseen its
ascent into the mainstream.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.880
Before he came along, wrestling was
splintered into fiefdoms,

11:52.900 --> 11:55.680
all of which
had their own broadcasts.

11:55.710 --> 11:59.730
Welcome to the special edition of
World-Class Championship Wrestling.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.770
Welcome to
Mid South Wrestling.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.700
Mid-Atlantic Wrestling.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.870
Welcome
to the Universal Wrestling Federation.

12:07.820 --> 12:13.830
I get wrestling is all about spectacle
and pageantry but a tuxedo, Jim?

12:14.700 --> 12:16.880
Tone it down a notch,
you're not at a fucking gala.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.700
Michael, as usual, no notes,
you look great, keep living your truth.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.590
Throughout the '80s and '90s,

12:23.610 --> 12:26.620
Vince McMahon eliminated or absorbed
his competitors

12:26.640 --> 12:30.600
and now one giant company
holds a monopoly on the industry.

12:30.620 --> 12:34.490
It's impossible to overstate
just how involved Vince is.

12:34.530 --> 12:37.500
He's not just CEO. He oversees
storylines, scripts,

12:37.520 --> 12:39.680
playing a fictionalized
version of himself,

12:39.700 --> 12:44.490
as the show's overarching villain,
his choices of how to dramatize

12:44.510 --> 12:45.720
have been pretty questionable,

12:46.490 --> 12:48.710
whether it's him forcing female
wrestlers to strip

12:49.480 --> 12:52.550
or beating up his supposed
illegitimate son, Hornswoggle,

12:52.570 --> 12:55.690
or dropping the ultimate racial
slur as part of a comedic skit.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.490
Sup, boss?
How you doing?

12:59.670 --> 13:03.490
- What's good in the 'hood?
- Trying to take care of business.

13:03.510 --> 13:04.580
Keep it up, my nigga.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.630
That is rough to watch.
And remember:

13:14.650 --> 13:17.510
he's in complete control
of those scripts.

13:17.620 --> 13:21.670
No one is making him do that.
While he is playing a villain there,

13:21.690 --> 13:23.840
there are other ways
that that can be achieved.

13:24.610 --> 13:27.760
Darth Vader was a great villain,
not once did he drop the n-word.

13:27.780 --> 13:31.790
R-2 said it pretty much nonstop,
it's why he kept getting bleeped.

13:32.640 --> 13:37.690
The fact that McMahon is an
active character in wrestling

13:37.710 --> 13:42.720
gives us an opportunity, he's taken a
lot of in-ring abuse over the years.

13:42.740 --> 13:44.830
At points where
you're gonna be disgusted,

13:45.600 --> 13:48.780
for say, using the n-word,
I can now simply play a clip like this,

13:48.820 --> 13:51.690
of The Rock smashing him
with a trashcan lid.

13:51.810 --> 13:53.610
I grabbed this!

13:54.760 --> 13:57.660
Wrestling's good.
It's just very good.

13:58.660 --> 14:04.750
While the character is an asshole,
the real Vince is also an asshole.

14:04.810 --> 14:10.810
Many fans hate him because while
the WWE has made him a billionaire,

14:10.830 --> 14:13.750
many wrestlers
say he's treated them terribly.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.820
Listen to Bret "Hitman" Hart,
one of the biggest wrestlers

14:17.600 --> 14:19.680
speaking about his former boss.

14:20.620 --> 14:23.800
Vince McMahon has always treated
wrestlers like circus animals.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.710
All these wrestlers that have
broke their backs for years

14:27.730 --> 14:31.610
end up with nothing when it's over,
they sort of take you out back

14:31.630 --> 14:35.730
and dump you out, and that's
the life of a professional wrestler.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.800
That may sound extreme.
But Hart has good reason to be angry.

14:39.820 --> 14:42.770
His own brother, Owen,
died wrestling for Vince.

14:42.800 --> 14:47.620
Hart is far from alone in voicing
grievances about his former employer.

14:47.640 --> 14:51.760
The shocking thing is the extent
to which he's shielded himself

14:51.780 --> 14:54.680
from responsibility
for wrestlers' welfare.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.710
The main way
he's done this is simple,

14:56.730 --> 15:00.670
while you might reasonably think
that the wrestlers employed by him

15:00.690 --> 15:03.720
are his employees,
they're actually not.

15:03.740 --> 15:06.610
They're merely
independent contractors.

15:06.630 --> 15:11.680
Which as former wrestler Jesse Ventura
pointed out on Howard Stern, is insane.

15:12.610 --> 15:15.750
How are they self-employed
when you're signed exclusively...

15:15.780 --> 15:18.760
- You can't work for nobody else.
- It's a monopoly.

15:19.260 --> 15:23.340
They tell you when and where you'll
work. They tell you who you'll work.

15:23.360 --> 15:27.270
- They control your life.
- And you're an independent contractor.

15:27.290 --> 15:29.480
And yet, they call you
an independent contractor.

15:30.250 --> 15:35.300
How has the government allowed them
to get away with that for 40 years?

15:35.460 --> 15:39.250
Yeah, he's got a point.
An independent contractor

15:39.270 --> 15:42.450
is someone that you might hire
for a specific, limited task,

15:42.470 --> 15:44.440
like a plumber, or an accountant.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.340
Wrestlers aren't either,

15:46.360 --> 15:50.290
apart from this wrestling plumber
and this wrestling accountant.

15:50.310 --> 15:52.420
The vast majority
are totally different.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.470
And as independent contractors,
wrestlers are exempt

15:56.240 --> 15:59.280
from most discrimination
and occupational safety laws.

15:59.300 --> 16:02.470
They don't get paid annual leave,
pensions, or health insurance.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.460
When you look at the
Department of Labor and the IRS's

16:05.480 --> 16:09.350
criteria for independent
contractors, it's a complete joke

16:09.370 --> 16:12.270
to think that they apply
to Vince's wrestlers.

16:12.290 --> 16:15.480
The IRS states that independent
contractors should be free to work

16:16.250 --> 16:17.440
when and for whom
they choose.

16:17.460 --> 16:21.450
Vince's wrestlers sign exclusive
contracts, so that's bullshit.

16:22.110 --> 16:25.280
Guidelines say someone's
probably not an independent contractor

16:25.310 --> 16:28.280
if the success or continuation
of a business

16:28.300 --> 16:32.080
depends to a degree
on the services they provide.

16:32.110 --> 16:36.280
Are wrestlers essential
to World Wrestling Entertainment?

16:37.110 --> 16:41.080
It's not called "World Totally
Empty Ring Entertainment."

16:41.110 --> 16:42.260
So there that might be clue.

16:42.280 --> 16:45.110
If I might quote
the company's own website:

16:45.130 --> 16:48.120
"WWE performers are
the company's greatest asset,"

16:48.140 --> 16:51.090
"without our performers,
WWE would not exist."

16:51.170 --> 16:56.260
When wrestlers might work years ago
for different organizations,

16:56.280 --> 16:59.100
it made sense
to call them contractors.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.300
But now that WWE has
a chokehold on this industry,

17:01.320 --> 17:05.270
it makes as much sense to call them
that as it does to call Jimmy Carter

17:05.290 --> 17:07.280
a "panty-dropping fuck machine."

17:07.300 --> 17:10.310
It's just clearly not true...
anymore.

17:12.130 --> 17:19.109
For what it's worth, back in 1986,
Ventura tried to unionize wrestlers

17:19.130 --> 17:22.250
which could've improved
their working conditions,

17:22.780 --> 17:24.869
but McMahon stamped it out hard.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.920
If that makes you want to see
someone stamp him out hard,

17:27.940 --> 17:29.820
I have some good news.

17:31.880 --> 17:32.930
Sweet chin music.

17:33.770 --> 17:36.930
Shawn, the sweet chin
music to Mr. McMahon.

17:37.970 --> 17:41.930
Shawn has knocked out the owner
of the World Wrestling Federation!

17:42.810 --> 17:44.950
Wrestling is better
than the things you like.

17:44.970 --> 17:49.840
The lack of a union to advocate
for wrestlers

17:49.860 --> 17:51.960
means that Vince
gets to call all the shots.

17:51.980 --> 17:55.980
While every sports league has
an off-season for athletes to recover,

17:56.000 --> 18:00.810
the WWE works its wrestlers
year-round, multiple times a week,

18:00.830 --> 18:04.780
both on TV and in untelevised
so-called "house shows".

18:04.800 --> 18:07.800
And big stars may be able
to command big money for that,

18:07.830 --> 18:09.930
but not every wrestler
is a big star.

18:09.980 --> 18:13.800
Whenever we've gotten glimpses
of wrestlers' contracts,

18:13.820 --> 18:15.830
they contain
astonishing clauses.

18:15.850 --> 18:19.810
If a wrestler is unable to wrestle
for six weeks because of an injury,

18:19.830 --> 18:21.930
the company
can terminate their contract.

18:21.950 --> 18:25.910
Another releases the company
from all liability for damage resulting

18:26.380 --> 18:29.590
in permanent injury or death,
even if caused by its own negligence.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.520
Which is a crazy thing for McMahon
to put in a contract.

18:33.540 --> 18:38.360
Enough to make you want to see him
be on his own medical mishap.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.400
How about your foot?

18:40.510 --> 18:43.410
You like that?
What do you think about that?

18:46.420 --> 18:47.590
Say what you like about that,

18:48.360 --> 18:51.550
still technically more helpful
than a visit from Dr. Oz.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.530
When you take this together

18:54.550 --> 18:57.460
with wrestlers
as independent contractors,

18:57.480 --> 19:00.550
in a monopolized industry,
free from meaningful oversight

19:00.570 --> 19:02.500
and able to be fired at any time,

19:02.520 --> 19:06.450
you wind up with an environment
with potential for unsafe conduct.

19:06.470 --> 19:09.430
Before Lance McNaught died
at 29 of heart failure,

19:09.450 --> 19:12.390
while struggling with addiction
to painkillers,

19:12.410 --> 19:14.430
he spoke of the pressure
that he felt:

19:14.490 --> 19:18.440
"If you get hurt, you work through it,
cause you'll lose your spot."

19:18.460 --> 19:21.490
Another top wrestler, CM Punk,
has questioned the advice

19:21.510 --> 19:24.530
given by a WWE doctor
following an incident in the ring.

19:24.600 --> 19:28.420
I got hit with something
and I got a concussion.

19:28.680 --> 19:32.690
But we were leaving for Europe the next
day, so Doc was leaning on me going:

19:33.650 --> 19:37.750
"Do you have a concussion
or can you go to Europe?"

19:37.810 --> 19:41.660
I was like: "You pigs,
I'll go to Europe. Whatever."

19:41.690 --> 19:45.610
That's on me, that's my fault.
I'm dry-heaving after every match.

19:45.640 --> 19:49.720
I'm either puking for real
or I'm just dry heaving.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.600
Doc's like:
"You're sick, here's a Z-Pak."

19:52.630 --> 19:56.780
They Z-Pak me to death,
I shit my pants on a SmackDown.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.600
He did! He actually did that
and we found that episode

20:01.620 --> 20:05.720
and out of common courtesy,
we are not going to show it to you.

20:05.810 --> 20:08.710
But, this is his face
as it was happening.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.750
Punk even tweeted about it:

20:10.770 --> 20:14.630
"Just shit my britches on Smackdown.
Please retweet."

20:15.640 --> 20:18.600
Something the WWE then
made him take down,

20:18.620 --> 20:20.760
even though it's the best
tweet ever written.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.740
Try and think of a better tweet!
Have you got one?

20:24.800 --> 20:27.730
Does it say: "Shit my britches,
please retweet?"

20:27.750 --> 20:30.620
Then it's not better, is it?
Stand down.

20:31.790 --> 20:36.890
It gets much worse than concussed
wrestlers shitting themselves,

20:36.910 --> 20:39.890
because wrestlers' bodies
regularly get smashed up

20:39.910 --> 20:44.800
and undergo general wear and tear,
damage that's cumulative.

20:44.840 --> 20:47.700
McMahon doesn't provide
health insurance

20:47.730 --> 20:50.860
for anything other than injuries
that occur inside the ring.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.910
The extent to which he's denied

20:53.680 --> 20:56.700
any responsibility
for their welfare is astonishing.

20:56.720 --> 20:59.730
Watch him respond to a question
about wrestler deaths.

20:59.760 --> 21:03.780
A reason why these people
would be dying under the age of 45?

21:03.840 --> 21:05.920
Why don't you ask
yourself that question?

21:06.690 --> 21:10.720
Are you indicating that's
my responsibility?

21:10.740 --> 21:14.700
I'm asking you if it's in any way
falls on your shoulders?

21:15.690 --> 21:20.690
I would accept no responsibility
whatsoever for their untimely deaths.

21:21.700 --> 21:25.720
You've got that little look like:
"How can you possibly say that?"

21:25.770 --> 21:29.840
But none whatsoever?
They were part of your organization.

21:29.860 --> 21:32.840
They worked a couple
of hundred nights a year for you.

21:34.440 --> 21:35.540
Oh my God!

21:37.350 --> 21:40.430
What are you doing,
you weird, weird man?

21:41.480 --> 21:44.470
While all of that is ridiculous,
my favorite response

21:44.500 --> 21:47.440
isn't the weird face or
the smacking of the papers.

21:47.460 --> 21:51.480
It's: "Why are wrestlers dying early?"
with "Why don't you ask yourself?"

21:51.520 --> 21:54.560
In terms of dodges,
is certifiably insane.

21:55.390 --> 21:58.360
Maybe because
that journalist doesn't employ

21:58.390 --> 22:01.530
any wrestlers and while I know that
you don't think you do either,

22:01.550 --> 22:03.530
you're fucking
wrong about that.

22:04.350 --> 22:07.490
The company will say that they've
transformed in recent years.

22:07.510 --> 22:11.460
They have taken positive steps,
like banning chair shots to the head

22:11.480 --> 22:13.540
and introducing
concussion protocols.

22:14.320 --> 22:18.330
CM Punk's experience suggests there
may be room for improvement.

22:18.370 --> 22:22.410
Some of the other steps they've taken
under their "Talent Wellness Program"

22:22.430 --> 22:26.520
are underwhelming, like the fact they
now have annual physical examinations.

22:26.540 --> 22:30.370
That's nothing. I have to take
one of those every year

22:30.390 --> 22:34.380
to host this show and I've never
once exploded through this table.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.720
It's in the name
of our show, now.

22:37.690 --> 22:41.750
The program also provides for things
like cardiovascular and brain testing,

22:41.770 --> 22:45.740
although they're still responsible
for their health insurance.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.590
Company pays for addiction
treatment for former wrestlers,

22:49.610 --> 22:53.740
that doesn't address the issues that
get them hooked on pain medication.

22:53.770 --> 22:59.570
Some have had to drag their
bodies back to the WWE,

22:59.600 --> 23:01.750
because they have
no other financial option.

23:01.770 --> 23:05.650
"Rowdy" Roddy Piper continued
wrestling into his 40's and 50's

23:05.670 --> 23:07.600
and listen to him explain why.

23:07.690 --> 23:10.740
Wrestling has
a tremendous entrance plan.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.790
You come in
as "Boy, here you are."

23:14.650 --> 23:17.580
Everything's wonderful,
it's got no exit plan.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.770
"Rowdy" Roddy Piper should know.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.630
A few months ago,
he climbed back into the ring.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.600
What would you have me do at 49

23:26.620 --> 23:30.750
my pension plan, I can't
take out till I'm 65.

23:31.570 --> 23:34.650
I'm not gonna make 65,
let's just face facts, guys.

23:35.140 --> 23:37.160
Sadly, he was right about that.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.080
Roddy Piper died in 2015
at the age of 61.

23:41.930 --> 23:44.100
While nothing I say can or should
make that okay,

23:44.120 --> 23:47.040
I hope that watching
this clip of Vince in the ring

23:47.060 --> 23:49.930
gives you just
a tiny piece of catharsis.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.020
He's a billionaire.
He owns this company.

23:54.930 --> 24:00.110
Lucifer's lips on the biggest
ass in the WWF. Hell yeah!

24:01.140 --> 24:05.070
The reassuring thing there is,
you can fake being kicked in the face

24:05.100 --> 24:09.020
or hit in the head with a bedpan,
but there is no faking that.

24:10.040 --> 24:14.990
So, I guess the question is,
is there any hope here?

24:15.030 --> 24:19.040
Incredibly, there might be.
There is one group that even McMahon

24:19.060 --> 24:22.050
occasionally seems to listen to
and that's the fans.

24:22.070 --> 24:25.010
They have a strong,
independent voice in the WWE.

24:25.040 --> 24:29.040
And have been vocal over the years,
from the dealings with Saudi Arabia,

24:29.060 --> 24:32.160
to its treatment of female wrestlers,
who have come a long way

24:32.930 --> 24:35.950
from the old days of so-called
"Bra and Panty" matches.

24:36.060 --> 24:39.160
Fans online launched a hashtag
#GiveDivasAChance campaign

24:39.180 --> 24:43.050
to feature women more
prominently, to which Vince responded:

24:43.090 --> 24:46.240
"We hear you. Keep watching."
Next week, for the first time ever,

24:46.270 --> 24:49.270
WrestleMania will be headlined
by a women's match.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.080
Wrestling fans don't just go along

24:52.100 --> 24:55.110
with whatever the company
tells them to cheer and boo.

24:55.130 --> 24:58.190
They know what they like
and what they don't like.

24:58.230 --> 25:04.170
The WWE tried for years to make
Roman Reigns a Superstar hero

25:04.190 --> 25:06.050
on the level of The Rock.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.270
But fans just didn't like him

25:08.050 --> 25:10.280
and they let him
and the WWE know about that.

25:11.080 --> 25:14.220
And keep in mind, Roman Reigns
is supposed to be a good guy.

25:15.170 --> 25:19.050
Fuck you, Roman!

25:27.080 --> 25:30.210
Asshole!

25:31.060 --> 25:33.230
Roman sucks!

25:35.140 --> 25:37.270
Go away!

25:41.100 --> 25:44.060
They booed him nonstop
for eight minutes!

25:45.070 --> 25:48.090
Might think that's harsh,
but it's the rational response

25:48.120 --> 25:50.160
to someone with
permanently wet hair.

25:50.180 --> 25:55.010
How can it always be wet? You look
like a pedophile out for a jog.

25:58.010 --> 26:03.100
The fans have a big voice here.
They care about these wrestlers

26:03.120 --> 26:07.100
and continue to do that long after
the WWE has abandoned them.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.100
Nowhere was the extent
of this devotion more obvious

26:10.120 --> 26:14.060
than when Jake "The Snake" needed
help paying for medical expenses.

26:14.970 --> 26:18.130
Jake has no insurance, he didn't have
money to pay for the surgery.

26:18.150 --> 26:20.150
We had to come up
with a solution.

26:20.190 --> 26:26.160
We put up a page on Indiegogo
to try to raise the money.

26:26.990 --> 26:28.050
Unfucking real.

26:28.970 --> 26:30.140
- Where we at?
- Holy cow.

26:31.180 --> 26:32.970
7,000.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.100
In one night?

26:35.960 --> 26:38.100
But the really cool thing
that came out of that

26:38.550 --> 26:41.570
is Jake got to see
how much the fans really cared.

26:42.540 --> 26:44.730
All those years, I guess
they did mean something.

26:46.620 --> 26:48.690
Yeah, those years
meant a lot to fans.

26:48.710 --> 26:52.520
That's why they want him and others
to be taken care of.

26:52.540 --> 26:55.760
There've been multiple GoFundMe
campaigns to cover both health care

26:56.530 --> 26:59.690
and funeral expenses for wrestlers
that fans have stepped up for.

26:59.710 --> 27:04.560
Fans shouldn't be the ones
shouldering that responsibility.

27:04.580 --> 27:09.570
Even the NFL,
for all its massive faults,

27:09.600 --> 27:13.610
now offers players health reimbursement
accounts and have established

27:13.630 --> 27:17.620
a "Legacy Fund" for older players
who may be dealing with health issues.

27:17.640 --> 27:20.710
When you've lost the moral high
ground to the fucking NFL,

27:21.530 --> 27:23.550
you are
morally subterranean.

27:23.740 --> 27:28.620
Here is where the potential
opportunity is,

27:28.750 --> 27:34.540
WrestleMania, the biggest event
in the WWE's calendar, is next Sunday.

27:34.580 --> 27:36.760
And if fans in that arena want
McMahon to help pay

27:37.540 --> 27:40.760
for wrestlers' long-term health care
or just to call them employees,

27:41.500 --> 27:43.690
they could choose
to make up chants about that.

27:43.710 --> 27:47.690
The event is live, they won't be
able to cut the chants out.

27:47.720 --> 27:51.640
I'm not saying that fans should
do that. Or make lots of signs.

27:51.690 --> 27:55.580
I really hope they make their
voices heard on this,

27:55.600 --> 27:58.710
because given that
Business Hulk here is a billionaire

27:59.480 --> 28:01.580
on the broken backs
of his non-employees,

28:01.630 --> 28:05.510
the very least he can do is show
the same dedication to wrestlers

28:05.530 --> 28:06.710
they have shown to his company.

28:07.480 --> 28:08.700
I haven't really said any of this

28:08.720 --> 28:11.590
in the preferred language
of wrestling fans.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.500
So, maybe this will help.

28:13.580 --> 28:16.580
Wrestling fans!
You cheered at Royal Rumble.

28:16.620 --> 28:20.660
You thrilled at Hell in a Cell.
You yelled at SummerSlam.

28:20.720 --> 28:23.540
Get ready to scream
for something new.

28:23.610 --> 28:28.530
I'm talking about all wrestlers having
access to retirement accounts,

28:28.600 --> 28:31.570
workers comp
and family and medical leave.

28:31.630 --> 28:35.590
How would you feel about watching
the most electrifying superstars

28:35.620 --> 28:38.540
do the unthinkable,
the "F" to the agents,

28:38.560 --> 28:42.510
65, 70, 75 and beyond!

28:43.730 --> 28:47.780
Performing thrilling moves
like walking comfortably,

28:48.640 --> 28:50.770
bending their knees
past a 90-degree angle

28:51.600 --> 28:54.780
and spending quality time
with their grandchildren!

28:55.810 --> 28:58.730
You could see all this
if a system was put in place

28:58.750 --> 29:01.670
that gave wrestlers
things like an off-season,

29:01.690 --> 29:05.660
the human body was not designed to do
things like this 200 nights a year.

29:06.760 --> 29:11.840
We're talking about bringing premature
wrestler deaths back in line.

29:13.600 --> 29:17.710
Did somebody say tables?
He's gonna need a doctor,

29:17.750 --> 29:21.650
and preferably one who won't
make him shit his pants on SmackDown.

29:21.670 --> 29:24.750
Please retweet!
At WrestleMania 35,

29:24.770 --> 29:28.740
why not join thousands of fans in
calling for your favorite wrestlers

29:28.760 --> 29:30.810
to be employees
so you never have to pay

29:30.830 --> 29:33.740
for their future surgeries
through GoFundMe?

29:34.630 --> 29:37.740
If Mr. McMahon doesn't like it,
you know what he can do.

29:40.650 --> 29:43.650
Some wrestlers were harmed
in the making of this video.

29:43.850 --> 29:47.040
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week, goodnight!

29:49.870 --> 29:51.990
