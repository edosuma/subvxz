- Kate, it's Albert. We've had
enough of this experience.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.033
- I'm so sorry to hear that.
Is everybody all right?

42:52.066 --> 42:54.600
- We have towels, no water.
- You have one job, deckhands.

42:54.633 --> 42:56.166
Captain, would you like
some dinner?

42:56.200 --> 42:58.033
- No, I'm gonna eat
somebody's ass for dinner.

42:58.066 --> 42:59.367
I am not gonna finish
the season this way.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.233
I will make some changes,

43:01.266 --> 43:03.100
and not all of you
are gonna be happy.

43:03.133 --> 43:06.133
