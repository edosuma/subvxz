00:00.381 --> 00:02.632
Previously on Music City.

00:02.769 --> 00:03.904
I want to go to law school.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.806
And I was going to put
in on hold, but I can't.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.174
- You're just like, ready.
- Yeah.

00:07.274 --> 00:08.675
You guys sound great.

00:08.775 --> 00:09.543
- Thank you.
- Where's your singer?

00:09.643 --> 00:10.878
You want to sit in?

00:10.978 --> 00:12.145
I really want you to
meet this guy Jackson.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.547
He's like, hot.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.015
I have never been on
a blind date before.

00:15.115 --> 00:16.416
I have a
Bible verse on my ribs.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.751
Show me!

00:17.851 --> 00:18.986
She's a
beautiful Southern girl.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.187
Jackson, your past relationships...

00:20.287 --> 00:23.156
You've had a few rocky
patches with the women.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.258
How's married life?

00:24.358 --> 00:26.894
He is gone a lot.

00:26.994 --> 00:30.163
I have accepted a tour and
I will be gone six weeks.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.598
I didn't sign up to be

00:31.698 --> 00:34.735
by myself in Nashville all the time.

00:34.770 --> 00:36.747
_

00:39.773 --> 00:40.762
Hi, honey.

00:40.810 --> 00:41.560
Good to see you guys.

00:41.561 --> 00:43.267
Wolfgang, you're so big, buddy.

00:43.268 --> 00:44.226
- Headbutt.
- Hi Dad.

00:44.227 --> 00:45.517
Headbutt.

00:45.518 --> 00:47.226
Aw.

00:47.518 --> 00:48.310
Can we knuckles?

00:48.311 --> 00:50.226
Knuckles.

00:50.227 --> 00:50.936
Knuckles!

00:50.937 --> 00:52.726
I tried texting you last night

00:52.727 --> 00:55.675
to see if we were gonna
Skype today, but...

00:55.738 --> 00:58.517
It's not the easiest
environment to communicate.

00:58.518 --> 01:01.226
I know, but just make it a priority.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.226
All right.

01:02.227 --> 01:03.684
So what have you been up to?

01:03.685 --> 01:04.244
Fill me in.

01:04.322 --> 01:06.434
Um, it's been super busy.

01:06.435 --> 01:11.476
I've just been nannying,
studying for the LSAT.

01:11.477 --> 01:12.768
How's the studying going?

01:12.769 --> 01:13.727
Honestly, I kinda hit a wall.

01:13.728 --> 01:16.601
But when you get back, I'm
gonna need you to watch Wolfgang

01:16.602 --> 01:19.368
and like, help me crank this out.

01:19.788 --> 01:20.289
Okay.

01:20.728 --> 01:23.225
So have you gotten out
and done anything cool?

01:23.226 --> 01:24.684
It's the same thing over
and over and over again.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.559
We just sit in the car
with five stinky guys

01:27.560 --> 01:29.309
and go for five hours and back.

01:29.310 --> 01:30.768
Where are you going next?

01:30.769 --> 01:33.559
I'll be in LA next, in Venice.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.477
In Venice?

01:34.478 --> 01:35.517
Will you bring me a seashell?

01:35.518 --> 01:37.309
No, there's no seashells, they groom it.

01:37.310 --> 01:40.309
Please bring me a
seashell from Venice Beach.

01:40.310 --> 01:41.226
I don't have time.

01:41.227 --> 01:42.517
I'll be there just long
enough to play a show

01:42.518 --> 01:44.226
and then I gotta get out of there.

01:44.227 --> 01:47.225
I'm so exhausted, all
I wanna do is get home.

01:47.226 --> 01:48.309
All right, guys I gotta go.

01:48.310 --> 01:50.185
I love you and I'll see you soon.

01:50.186 --> 01:51.186

We've talked.

And it's been good.

02:41.288 --> 02:42.536
Probably more forward than you are.

02:42.537 --> 02:45.161
Honestly, I dunno if this is
true for most Southern guys,

02:45.162 --> 02:47.119
but a lot of times that is a turnoff.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.745
If like, the girl is more aggressive.

02:48.746 --> 02:51.077
It was never a problem for me.

02:51.078 --> 02:52.453
I know.

02:52.454 --> 02:54.328
I just think maybe if
you guys hang out again...

02:54.329 --> 02:59.286
I'm totally down to
go on another date or...

Just kind of one of those
super anxious feelings;

04:01.746 --> 04:04.203
I may have had one or two
before I saw her, so I was...

04:05.788 --> 04:06.496
Well is she pretty?

04:06.497 --> 04:08.077
I mean, she was gorgeous.

04:08.078 --> 04:08.829
Oh that's good.

04:08.830 --> 04:10.077
She's blonde; she's a little older,

04:10.078 --> 04:12.912
which isn't a bad thing.

04:12.913 --> 04:14.661
Have you ever been
out with anybody older?

04:14.662 --> 04:17.286

04:28.454 --> 04:31.119
Is she just here for
music, is that why she...

04:31.120 --> 04:31.829
Yeah.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.077
Honestly what's been
on my heart and mind

04:33.078 --> 04:35.369
is this singing thing.

04:35.370 --> 04:36.025
Really?

04:36.153 --> 04:36.861
Yeah.

what's been going on with Jackson?

I mean, there's just a lot
we still haven't talked about.

06:06.162 --> 06:09.536
He still doesn't know that I'm
saving myself for marriage.

06:09.537 --> 06:12.703
Which is like, significant, obviously.

06:12.704 --> 06:16.286
Kerry was my first,
but he wasn't my only.

06:16.287 --> 06:17.828
What!

06:17.829 --> 06:19.703
So, when Kerry and I first got married,

06:19.704 --> 06:21.661
we got separated after a year.

06:21.662 --> 06:26.704
During that time, I met
this nice guy named Jay.

06:27.333 --> 06:27.916
Wow.

06:28.033 --> 06:29.078
And he and I hooked up.

06:29.079 --> 06:31.495
And then when Kerry and
I got back together,

06:31.496 --> 06:33.328
I told him right away, like day one.

06:33.329 --> 06:36.578
And then he went in the
bathroom and threw up for like,

06:36.579 --> 06:37.995
- a little while.
- Oh!

06:37.996 --> 06:38.746
Wait...

06:38.746 --> 06:39.579
He loves you.

07:01.704 --> 07:05.578
at a school call Clackman,
it's a baseball school;

07:05.579 --> 07:06.496
I played wood bat...

07:06.497 --> 07:07.745
- You played baseball?
- You played baseball?

07:07.746 --> 07:08.704
I played baseball.

07:08.704 --> 07:09.412
I can see that.

07:09.413 --> 07:11.703
I feel like I could see
you playing baseball.

07:11.704 --> 07:14.995
Okay, so, I want to
hear about your music.

07:14.996 --> 07:15.746

07:15.746 --> 07:16.662
Well, I have a lot of lyrics.

07:16.663 --> 07:18.536
I have a lot of music,
a lot of stuff written,

07:18.537 --> 07:20.244
but it's just so hard to get it still,

07:20.245 --> 07:21.703
like I don't know where to begin.

07:21.704 --> 07:25.578

Bryant tomorrow, but...

07:25.579 --> 07:30.412

08:12.370 --> 08:13.453
Surprise, surprise.

08:13.454 --> 08:15.495
Surprise, surprise; I do like surprises.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.329
Oh, and tattoos are bad!

08:16.329 --> 08:17.078
Tattoos are bad.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.912
Is that one still there?

08:18.913 --> 08:19.871
It is still there.

08:19.872 --> 08:22.620
So, what've you been doing?

08:22.621 --> 08:24.536
I guess...

08:24.537 --> 08:25.953
You been singing lately?

08:25.954 --> 08:26.995
Trying to.

08:26.996 --> 08:27.746
Shower, car...

08:27.747 --> 08:30.912
Oh wow, really, widening your horizons?

08:30.913 --> 08:33.453
You have a good way
of like, letting it go.

08:33.453 --> 08:34.370
I don't just let it go.

08:34.371 --> 08:36.077
Well I'm going to be "letting it go"

08:36.078 --> 08:39.410
in the studio this week...

08:39.412 --> 08:40.535
Yeah?

08:40.537 --> 08:43.077
Would you want to come?

08:43.078 --> 08:44.078
Is that a date?

08:44.078 --> 08:49.077
You know, it's like come to
the studio and sing with me.

08:49.078 --> 08:49.871

08:49.872 --> 08:51.087

12:21.483 --> 12:23.480
- Yes, yeah.
- So...

12:23.481 --> 12:24.689
You're a musician; that's what you do.

12:24.690 --> 12:26.898
But I, I never thought
that being a musician

12:26.906 --> 12:27.953
was what I wanted to do.

12:28.020 --> 12:28.399
Yeah.

12:28.454 --> 12:30.689
I am able to sing; I think
I'm a pretty good singer,

12:30.690 --> 12:32.023
I just don't play any instruments.

12:32.024 --> 12:34.398
I played the clarinet when
I was like 13 ,

12:34.399 --> 12:36.398
but that's about it.

12:36.399 --> 12:37.480
Yeah, yeah, well we'll start there.

12:37.481 --> 12:41.356
Let's just, you bring your
clarinet over, and...

12:41.357 --> 12:42.647
I've never been in a
co-write with a clarinet.

12:42.648 --> 12:44.480
That could be the funniest
thing I've ever seen.

12:45.482 --> 12:47.480
All right guys, let's
see, we have our tacos...

12:47.481 --> 12:48.647
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

12:48.648 --> 12:49.689
Perfect, y'all enjoy your lunch.

12:49.690 --> 12:50.565
Thank you.

12:50.566 --> 12:52.606
Have you been in co-writes and,

12:52.607 --> 12:55.564
they've like tried to turn
it into something else?

12:55.565 --> 12:56.898
No because I don't even get that far,

12:56.899 --> 12:58.689
because I know what's going on.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.480
In Nashville, the minute a man finds out

13:01.481 --> 13:02.856
I'm a singer or a songwriter...

13:02.857 --> 13:03.523
Oh my gosh.

13:03.524 --> 13:05.480
They're like, "Oh well we
should write together sometime."

13:05.481 --> 13:07.356
Yeah.

13:07.357 --> 13:07.773
"Write."

13:07.774 --> 13:09.606
You know, for every great
person there's a shady person.

13:09.607 --> 13:12.606
I would say for every great
there's probably four shady.

13:12.607 --> 13:14.731
Yeah you're right, you're right.

13:14.732 --> 13:15.523
You're absolutely right.

13:15.524 --> 13:18.400
But if we're going to co-write,
I think of it as business.

13:18.470 --> 13:19.607
Cheers to business.

13:19.608 --> 13:20.647
Cheers to business.

13:20.648 --> 13:21.731
No funny business, okay.

13:21.732 --> 13:23.772
So when you're walking
down the street in Nashville,

13:23.773 --> 13:26.689
who are the guys that turn your head?

13:26.690 --> 13:29.898
Somebody that resembles
Justin Timberlake:

13:29.899 --> 13:33.064
tall, blond, he's got
blue eyes like yours.

13:33.065 --> 13:36.814
But I haven't really focused
on the whole dating aspect.

13:36.815 --> 13:39.522
Some good lyrics are written
from a breakup, but...

13:39.523 --> 13:40.481
Yes.

13:40.482 --> 13:41.981
Do you date people that
you know are bad for you

13:41.982 --> 13:44.481
so they break your heart and
you can write a song about it?

13:44.482 --> 13:45.481
Honestly I have before.

13:45.482 --> 13:46.939
That's not healthy.

13:46.940 --> 13:49.480
It's not healthy, but I'm
a musician, so, you know...

13:49.481 --> 13:50.606
Stop.

13:50.607 --> 13:53.522
We go on tour 80% of the year;

13:53.523 --> 13:55.898
that's not a normal person thing.

13:55.899 --> 13:57.064
You know Kerry's on tour.

13:57.065 --> 14:00.065
Late nights, bad food...

14:00.103 --> 14:00.770
Girls.

14:00.818 --> 14:02.233
Absolutely!

14:02.370 --> 14:05.482
Okay, so as a male...

14:06.363 --> 14:07.904
In a band...

14:07.905 --> 14:09.112
That's kind of attractive,

14:09.113 --> 14:12.278
are women just like fawning
all over you all the time?

14:12.279 --> 14:14.986
It is surreal most of the time.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.445
And a guy with a
heartthrob image like Kerry

14:16.446 --> 14:19.112
is definitely getting
a lot of attention.

14:19.113 --> 14:21.362
Even though he's got
a ring on his finger?

14:21.363 --> 14:21.987
Aw, it...

14:21.988 --> 14:23.946
Just because there's a goalie

14:23.947 --> 14:25.947
doesn't mean you don't play soccer.

14:25.947 --> 14:29.363
♪ Ain't nobody as bad as me ♪

14:36.139 --> 14:37.040
Hey!

14:37.422 --> 14:38.290
I poured you a glass of wine.

14:38.390 --> 14:39.023
Yay!

14:39.111 --> 14:41.781
Wolf is down, so we have
like an hour, maybe two.

14:42.561 --> 14:43.395
Good news, good news.

14:43.495 --> 14:44.596
Good news.

14:44.696 --> 14:45.664
So when's Kerry back?

14:45.764 --> 14:46.632
He gets back tomorrow.

14:46.732 --> 14:48.700
Six weeks was way too long.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.070
So, I went
to brunch with Bryant,

14:52.170 --> 14:54.072
and it was interesting
to get his perspective

14:54.172 --> 14:58.677
because he is a guy, but
Kerry is gone all the time,

14:59.778 --> 15:02.180
so when he's gone you're
not thinking about,

15:02.281 --> 15:04.683
if he's with a girl, or...

15:04.783 --> 15:08.554
If Kerry were to choose
to be unfaithful to me,

15:08.654 --> 15:11.623
and I need to know about
it, like, I'll find about,

15:11.723 --> 15:13.025
like, the world will tell me.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.726
Yes.

15:14.826 --> 15:15.928
You know what I mean?

15:16.028 --> 15:18.764
Okay so when you guys
were dating, was this,

15:18.864 --> 15:21.366
how far along was he
with his music career?

15:21.466 --> 15:23.035
It wasn't a thing.

15:23.135 --> 15:25.537
And I thought it was going to be like,

15:25.637 --> 15:27.839
a journey together. A team, yeah!

15:27.940 --> 15:30.309
But, he's doing his own
thing so either I like,

15:30.442 --> 15:32.844
keep chasing him around, and like...

15:32.945 --> 15:33.812
"Poor me, poor me, my
husband's gone all the time

15:33.912 --> 15:35.948
"and I'm left here alone."

15:36.048 --> 15:39.935
Yeah, or like, forge my own path.

15:40.485 --> 15:43.055
I mean like, why would I go
to law school in Nashville

15:43.155 --> 15:46.058
when he's never here?

16:06.345 --> 16:07.279

16:07.379 --> 16:08.547

16:08.647 --> 16:09.915
Yeah, no it's pretty sweet.

16:10.015 --> 16:12.017
It would be cool if, maybe
if you just show me few things,

16:12.117 --> 16:13.085
if that's cool.

16:13.185 --> 16:14.386
Yeah, no, totally.

16:14.486 --> 16:16.555
Okay, so I want to, let's
see, what song do you know

16:16.655 --> 16:17.956
that we could like...

16:18.056 --> 16:19.491
Like, "I'm Going to Lose You,"

16:19.524 --> 16:21.193
by Meghan Trainor and John Legend?

16:21.293 --> 16:22.227
Let's hear it.

16:22.327 --> 16:25.564
♪ So I'm gonna love you ♪

16:25.664 --> 16:28.800
♪ Like I'm going to lose you ♪

16:28.901 --> 16:30.102
There you go, whoa!

16:30.202 --> 16:33.005
See like, I feel like
sometimes it's like "Hell yeah,"

16:33.105 --> 16:34.806
but other times like,
"What just happened there?"

16:34.907 --> 16:36.241
Yeah, you know what that takes?

16:36.341 --> 16:37.509
What?

16:37.609 --> 16:38.777
- Confidence.
- Yeah, I feel you.

16:38.877 --> 16:39.611
So we're going to start with this...

16:39.711 --> 16:41.280
Positivity, in the studio.

16:41.446 --> 16:42.514
I want to hear you say,
"I am a good singer."

16:42.614 --> 16:43.982
I am a good singer.

16:44.082 --> 16:45.150
I got this song.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.618
I got this song.

16:46.718 --> 16:47.920
John Legend's got
nothing on me.

16:48.020 --> 16:49.454
He got nothing on me.

16:49.555 --> 16:50.789
Are you ready to rock?

Um...

at this point in my life.

18:41.199 --> 18:43.035
I'm saving myself for marriage

18:43.135 --> 18:46.171

It's rare that anyone
does that, I mean...

18:49.207 --> 18:52.010

that I decided a long time ago.

18:52.110 --> 18:55.914

It's something that, I
mean, I'm not a virgin...

18:58.283 --> 19:01.820
And that's okay; that's
not a deal-breaker to me.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.689
Yeah, it's just, I hope
that doesn't make you

19:03.789 --> 19:04.756
