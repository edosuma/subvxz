WEBVTT

00:15.516 --> 00:17.151
Previously on
The White Princess...

00:17.651 --> 00:20.588
We put a servant boy
in the Tower in my brother
Richard's place

00:20.688 --> 00:22.022
and we sent him
off to safety.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.324
My darling Richard.

00:23.557 --> 00:24.558
My Perkin.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.194
The boy is the son of
a boatman from Tournai

00:26.660 --> 00:28.296
and his name is
Perkin Warbeck.

00:28.562 --> 00:32.066
There are faces from every
royal house in Europe.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.434
Apart from Spain.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.668
We must settle
Arthur's betrothal.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.970
To the Princess
Catherine of Aragon.

00:37.071 --> 00:39.006
If we can come to terms
with Isabella of Castile,

00:39.107 --> 00:40.374
that would be
the best deterrent.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.747
When Prince Richard
rises against him,

00:46.847 --> 00:50.151
I will call on both
you and your conscience
to join us.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.620
Where is the boy?

00:55.456 --> 00:56.757
A message from
your Lady Mother.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.526
She has the boy.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.437
Look at him.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.475
Any fool can see
he looks nothing like a York.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.750
Is the court assembled?

02:30.251 --> 02:32.286
They await
Your Grace's favor.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.613
Your Grace,

04:05.979 --> 04:08.882
I bring you the cause
of England's troubles.

04:25.733 --> 04:29.570
The money wasted,
the lives lost,
bringing you here.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.806
And all for what?
A peasant boy.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.510
I will enjoy your execution.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.745
You'll be hung,
drawn and quartered,

04:37.845 --> 04:39.680
so that the last
thing that...
You should kill me

04:42.550 --> 04:44.718
if you wish
to stay upon my throne.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.763
I am the son
of King Edward, the IV
and Queen Elizabeth Woodville.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.904
And I am
rightful King of England.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.076
You thought that I was
murdered, but I live.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.780
So, you will stand aside
and return to me

05:12.880 --> 05:14.982
the crown and throne
which have been
stolen from me,

05:15.816 --> 05:18.819
or you will face the righteous
wrath of Almighty God,

05:19.987 --> 05:23.391
who will rage against your sin
and cast you into hell.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.535
Bravo.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.505
A fine performance.
You have missed your calling.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.544
Perhaps you wish to be
a mummer in my court?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.452
I will ask
the Queen of England
what to do with you,

05:51.552 --> 05:52.786
seeing as you claim
she is your sister.

05:52.886 --> 05:53.954
Tell me, Queen Elizabeth,

05:55.689 --> 05:56.924
is this your kin?

06:11.472 --> 06:12.773
My brothers are both dead.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.450
Not quite the welcome
you imagined.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.823
While I decide
what to do with you,

06:30.624 --> 06:33.561
I shall make you a servant
at our court.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.596
You shall be

06:37.798 --> 06:39.800
knave of the King's wardrobe.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.870
You may care
for the robes you covet.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.739
You may even
sleep among them.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.526
He is an enemy of the crown.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.728
You must make a show
of killing him.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.497
An enemy backed
by half of Europe,

07:09.530 --> 07:11.064
who may be mustering to come
against me as we speak.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.134
He is a counterfeit!
Of course he is
a counterfeit!

07:14.234 --> 07:15.669
You think
we do not know that?

07:15.769 --> 07:18.739
He says himself that
I must kill him as a threat,
so I will not.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.575
I will not
be commanded by him.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.612
I will parade him.

07:24.712 --> 07:25.979
Do you agree?
I...

07:26.079 --> 07:28.115
Drag him through the streets
and show the world I have him.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.818
And then...
When he is humiliated,

07:30.918 --> 07:31.852
he will give up his claim,

07:31.952 --> 07:32.986
and his supporters
will forget him.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.154
But they may not.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.056
Or people may believe
his claim just because...

07:36.156 --> 07:37.625
You must not do this.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.629
By killing him, the boy
becomes a myth and martyr.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.667
His power, ten times greater
in the ballads that they sing.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.704
He must appear the maggot
that he is

07:50.804 --> 07:52.005
so that Europe
will be embarrassed

07:52.105 --> 07:53.173
to have had him
at their table.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.588
I want to find
his wife and child.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.558
They are of value to us.

08:11.759 --> 08:14.595
He left the battlefield
to go to her once.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.565
Now, I don't believe
they can be far from Beaulieu.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.168
He will have left her
in the church for sanctuary.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.004
But Rome agrees
that traitors

08:24.104 --> 08:26.206
can no longer
find refuge in the church.

08:27.140 --> 08:30.043
Better you make her
come to us by choice.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.680
Persuade her
that her husband needs her.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.682
Tell me when you have her.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.158
Don't you think he looks
like Lady Mother?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.127
Isn't it just his hair?

08:47.628 --> 08:48.929
Boys.
Why would he say

08:49.029 --> 08:50.931
that he's
my uncle Richard if...
Exactly.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.233
When he knows that
it would get him into trouble.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.268
Well, he must believe it
to be true,

08:55.368 --> 08:56.970
but then he wouldn't...
What are you saying
to my sons?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.275
Come outside.
Come quickly now.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.983
Lizzie?
Have you spoken to him?

09:12.085 --> 09:13.987
He is nothing
like my brother.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.102
Here.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.639
I'll not go.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.874
You must.
No, I must not.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.044
I have never joined you
for the hunt or any
other blood sport,

09:37.144 --> 09:38.278
and I will not
start with this.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.848
You may tell the King
that we are unwell

09:40.948 --> 09:41.915
or whatever else
you please.

09:42.916 --> 09:43.884
Come on.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.825
They chose someone
who has York looks
to add to the deception.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.127
He's an enemy
to our country

09:54.227 --> 09:55.896
and will try
to take what is yours.

09:56.664 --> 09:57.931
That's all.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.371
We are ready.

10:22.222 --> 10:25.625
Behold the enemy of England,

10:26.259 --> 10:28.161
the York pretender!

10:30.130 --> 10:33.033
The boy who's been a thorn
in England's side.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.134
Spit at him.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.103
Throw stones.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.040
He made you go to war
and lose your kinsmen!

10:43.010 --> 10:45.378
And he has cost you
dear in taxes.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.248
I do not blame you,
the good people of London.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.017
I do not blame my sister.

10:50.751 --> 10:51.985
She must protect her sons.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.223
He is a liar and he insults
the memory of your Queen's
departed brother!

10:56.323 --> 10:57.825
My sister is a natural queen

10:58.491 --> 11:00.861
and there will be no pleasure
in taking that from her.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.196
"Take it from her."
Hear his gall.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.839
Our mother hid me on the night
the soldiers came for you.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.775
You didn't say goodbye,
as you were angry with me.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.143
Let us through!

11:16.977 --> 11:18.311
Let us through there!

11:18.411 --> 11:20.781
You always thought our mother
loved me more than you.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.354
Get him back
to the palace.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.189
I miss you, Lizzie.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.992
I wish that you would
speak to me.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.030
But I forgive you.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.002
This way! This way!

12:43.030 --> 12:44.031
Here we are.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.209
Now he can play king
to his heart's content.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.350
Do we know where
they are keeping him?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.052
He is at Westminster.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.486
Henry hopes
the mask will fall

13:06.586 --> 13:08.421
if he observes him
long enough.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.957
Hurry, Madam, please.

13:10.057 --> 13:11.458
We have prepared
a room for you.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.861
I need to send
a message to someone.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.993
Cathy Gordon.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.395
Why is she here?

14:01.942 --> 14:03.010
Here, boy.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.146
Come on.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.115
Come where?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.490
Lady Catherine Gordon.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.126
I am My Lady,
The King's Mother.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.461
Welcome to our court.
Where is my husband?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.104
Please curtsey
to the Queen.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.546
This way.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.094
Clear the dung
and scrub the steps.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.303
I've told you that
I will do nothing
to debase myself.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.005
And when you've finished,

15:05.105 --> 15:07.474
you will bring
this noble lady's
belongings inside.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.444
What is he doing?

15:13.080 --> 15:14.447
His claims are false.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.450
- He is a servant.
- He is your brother.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.553
Your marriage is annulled.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.489
It was made
under false pretenses.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.590
What?

15:25.125 --> 15:27.060
Your wife and son
are here at court.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.100
You shall resume
your maiden name,

15:33.200 --> 15:35.335
and your son
will be called a bastard.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.705
But you will be treated
in accordance
with your royal birth.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.342
- So I am your prisoner?
- You are our guest.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.644
What if I don't wish
to be your guest?

15:45.578 --> 15:47.680
Then you may leave your son
and freely return to Scotland.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.519
What name
have you given him?

15:52.752 --> 15:54.221
He will be tended to
by midwives.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.388
No.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.057
No!

15:57.757 --> 15:59.026
No!

16:01.094 --> 16:02.095
You will let them do this?

16:02.195 --> 16:05.498
You are of the royal birth.
It is the custom.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.068
He is your nephew,
Edward.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.407
I need to see my husband.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.362
Richard.
Are you hurt?

16:37.230 --> 16:38.365
Cathy.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.200
Why are you here?
How did they find you?

16:40.300 --> 16:41.268
The monks said...
Monks?

16:41.368 --> 16:42.569
The monks said that
I should come to you,

16:42.669 --> 16:44.104
that I can help you.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.405
They've taken Edward.
Oh, Cathy,

16:45.505 --> 16:46.706
they've lied to you
to bring you here.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.708
They would not dare
to hurt me.
I am Scottish royal.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.711
No, they won't hurt you.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.680
Don't say it!
Do not say it.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.249
Oh, Cathy.
You should have stayed away
as I had asked of you.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.351
Cathy.
They will not hurt
our Edward.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.720
No, they can't.
My love, where have
they taken him?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.122
Cathy, where is he?

17:02.689 --> 17:03.690
Where is he now?

17:05.092 --> 17:07.327
You know what they did
to my brother Edward
in the Tower.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.097
They killed him
and we never found his body.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.332
And the other boy as well.
It was them, Cathy.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.734
It was those who rule
my country now.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.203
Now, why are you here?

17:17.504 --> 17:18.671
You were meant to be
in sanctuary.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.140
They said
we are not married.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.575
That I can go to Scotland
but our baby must stay here.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.344
Shh! Cathy.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.114
We will
change our plan.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.618
I will give up my claim.
No!

17:31.718 --> 17:33.486
You can't deny
your birthright.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.389
And if you did,
the Scots and all of Europe
would abandon you.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.191
The only thing
that keeps you safe

17:38.291 --> 17:39.592
and us with you

17:40.293 --> 17:42.262
is if you hold fast
and they back us.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.797
I'm so sorry, my love.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.168
I'm so sorry.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.157
You see now that you have
cards to play.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.359
A wife and son.

18:12.725 --> 18:13.860
It's quite a hand.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.299
Even to his wife,
he holds the lie.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.767
No, he knows that
he is spied on.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.735
He is a fake
but not a fool.

18:24.737 --> 18:27.174
He thinks it was a Tudor
who killed the boys
in the Tower.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.808
Then he only shows
his ignorance.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.511
Who could it be
if it were not King Richard?

18:31.611 --> 18:32.779
It was Richard.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.582
To clear his way
to take the throne.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.704
It was your mother, then,
who brought her here?

18:59.739 --> 19:02.575
She is his link to King James
and the Scottish army.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.446
Their union must be broken.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.881
And how will you break it?

19:12.785 --> 19:14.221
An annulment
will not rob them

19:14.321 --> 19:15.688
of their feelings
for each other.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.325
You think she cares for him?
She must,

19:19.592 --> 19:21.461
for he has little else
to offer her.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.699
You will take her
as your lady,

19:28.335 --> 19:30.337
which will at least
appease the Scots.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.510
Tell me of your brother.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.579
What was he like?

19:42.549 --> 19:43.916
It was a long time ago.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.287
Another lifetime.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.257
You said he was there
that day when my soldiers
came for you.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.759
What was he wearing?

19:52.859 --> 19:54.394
What was said?
Tell me everything.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.473
Why does Henry wear his crown?

20:06.573 --> 20:09.376
It is a hunt,
not a state occasion.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.743
Perhaps he thinks
he's riding into battle.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.546
Did not King Richard
wear his crown at Bosworth?

20:15.382 --> 20:16.483
Carry my weapons.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.689
Here.

20:29.862 --> 20:30.863
Come.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.729
This copse is where
we'll take our sport.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.532
Give me my long-bow.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.768
You do not
have to do this, Henry.

21:09.336 --> 21:10.337
I'm not your enemy.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.677
Use that stick

21:19.045 --> 21:20.647
and beat the bushes.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.921
What is his plan?

21:30.623 --> 21:31.824
Does he have one?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.593
It is a hunt.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.596
You shoot your prey.

21:58.951 --> 22:01.588
They say that you came
here of your own free will.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.827
You should leave
here if you can.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.830
Henry would be
rid of him.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.401
He is looking for a reason
and if he cannot find one,

22:14.467 --> 22:15.668
he will lock him up
in any case,

22:15.768 --> 22:16.969
as he did my brother.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.509
I know you know
he's Richard.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.644
And if you
want your brother free,

22:25.144 --> 22:26.779
you should back his claim.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.482
Maggie, come here beside me.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.844
Do you like to hunt?

23:01.147 --> 23:02.682
Go deeper in the bushes.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.456
You will dine with me
this evening.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.891
I have no appetite,
Your Grace.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.561
You are without a husband.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.062
I will make sure
that you're taken care of.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.839
With a royal education,

23:26.939 --> 23:28.708
you, of course, would know
the patron saint of hunting.

23:38.885 --> 23:42.922
Saint Hubert,
who saw the Cross
between the antlers of a stag.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.693
Our uncle Anthony
taught us about him.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.102
You know I am your brother.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.607
Stop it!

24:02.174 --> 24:03.610
Your aim is short.

24:04.577 --> 24:05.578
You're not holding
high enough

24:06.145 --> 24:07.680
and you're dragging
on release.

24:08.915 --> 24:09.882
Henry!

24:09.982 --> 24:11.784
I understand
how hard it is for you...

24:12.284 --> 24:14.020
Shut up.
...to step aside.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.789
Shut up.
I promise that your family
will be well cared...

24:16.889 --> 24:18.991
- Shut up!
- She is my sister after all.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.527
Shut up!
You will have to
leave the court.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.694
Shut up!

24:40.146 --> 24:41.548
Give it to me.

24:45.885 --> 24:46.919
Give it to me!

24:47.854 --> 24:48.821
Give that to the King!

25:04.236 --> 25:05.938
Collect your weapons.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.107
We will return to the palace.

25:16.783 --> 25:17.784
Come on.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.790
Duchess of Burgundy bids
you come to Cheapside.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.792
The market cross
at midnight.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.233
- Good day to you both.
- My dear.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.204
What did you say to her?

25:40.973 --> 25:42.241
Cathy Gordon.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.411
I told her I was sorry.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.149
I would like you to serve
as one of my ladies.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.822
Finding loyalty
has become a challenge.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.725
I would be honored, but...

25:59.158 --> 26:01.260
But our home
is very far away

26:01.360 --> 26:02.829
and we are hoping
to return there soon.

26:02.929 --> 26:03.930
It is too far away.

26:05.297 --> 26:06.633
Henry trusts your husband

26:06.666 --> 26:07.867
and would like
to keep him close.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.104
You always said
you wished to be near Teddy.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.192
Sir Richard.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.164
Enjoy.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.908
So, you've had to dine alone.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.277
You look exactly
as Mother did

26:51.377 --> 26:53.680
when our father
was with his mistress.

26:53.713 --> 26:54.681
Jane Shore.

26:55.882 --> 26:56.916
Stop it.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.032
Go.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.334
Spend the night
with your husbands.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.338
Don't fret, lad.
She's safe with us.

27:52.438 --> 27:53.973
Out the way!

28:18.197 --> 28:20.299
It is endlessly
fascinating to me,

28:20.399 --> 28:21.868
your River Thames.

28:22.969 --> 28:25.271
All afternoon, I have
watched the boats

28:25.371 --> 28:28.407
moving like busy beetles
across its back.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.779
I always want to know
what they are all carrying.

28:34.180 --> 28:37.984
Spices, garments and jewels.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.321
A secret army?

28:44.223 --> 28:45.925
What is it
that you want of me?

28:48.127 --> 28:50.897
Oh, I would be
very much obliged

28:51.530 --> 28:54.133
if you would help me
rescue Richard,

28:54.967 --> 28:57.003
the rightful heir
to the throne of England,

28:57.103 --> 28:59.105
and his wife and child,
of course.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.341
I wish I could with
all my heart, but I...

29:02.441 --> 29:05.311
I hear they are keeping him
in the King's wardrobe.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.881
Because the door locks
to keep the royal jewels safe.

29:08.981 --> 29:13.019
And I have looked down
on this river all day long

29:13.119 --> 29:15.922
and I have watched
the laundry barges

29:16.022 --> 29:19.291
drifting back and forth

29:19.391 --> 29:21.861
from one bank
to the other.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.495
And I picture
the young king

29:23.595 --> 29:26.232
sleeping on his
hard wooden floor

29:27.466 --> 29:31.337
and all around him,
robes and linen.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.141
My Lady aunt,
if I could mount a rescue,

29:35.241 --> 29:36.275
my brother would be free.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.477
They will never
let your brother out.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.415
Your only hope
of freeing him

29:43.515 --> 29:45.918
is putting Richard
on the throne.

29:51.223 --> 29:55.862
We are none of us fearless,
ma fleur tremblante.

29:58.164 --> 30:03.135
But we are women
and we do what we must do.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.252
Your face looks dreadful,

30:23.122 --> 30:24.090
like a death mask.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.491
What is wrong
with your eyes?

30:25.591 --> 30:27.326
I'm tired, My Lady.

30:29.061 --> 30:31.530
They are dull and red
like old embers.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.834
Your cheeks are blemished
and your skin flakes.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.403
Your husband,
the King, wished

30:37.503 --> 30:39.005
for a prodigious night
and so we had.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.344
I suppose
you think he likes you?

30:46.378 --> 30:48.214
I think nothing, Your Grace.
Nothing?

30:48.614 --> 30:51.850
Nothing at all?
You have an empty head?

30:51.951 --> 30:53.085
Here, let's see.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.155
Yes.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.058
I hear the empty
chamber echo.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.327
Lizzie, don't.
Did you touch

31:01.427 --> 31:03.062
my husband,
Catherine Gordon?

31:04.496 --> 31:05.932
Did he touch you?

31:06.032 --> 31:07.299
No, Your Grace.
"No"?

31:08.100 --> 31:09.068
No?

31:28.254 --> 31:29.956
Clean that up.

31:55.547 --> 31:58.250
Quite a night I had
with Lady Catherine.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.555
I am spent.

32:08.227 --> 32:09.228
Henry?

32:13.132 --> 32:14.500
Why would you do it?

32:15.701 --> 32:17.103
Dine alone with her?

32:19.705 --> 32:21.440
Do you wish to cuckold him?

32:22.241 --> 32:23.375
Humiliate him?

32:24.243 --> 32:26.412
Make him weak
in her eyes and England's?

32:27.346 --> 32:29.148
She seemed amenable
to approach.

32:29.248 --> 32:30.249
Mmm.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.020
Surely you can see
how besotted they are
with each other.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.455
You cannot believe
she would betray him
and her child.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.590
He leans on her.

32:38.690 --> 32:39.658
Hmm.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.261
I must turn her against him.
Take away his strength.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.330
By making her believe
you desire her?

32:44.730 --> 32:47.066
You have seen his manner.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.502
Eternally as though
God in heaven shines
a blinding light on him.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.506
He draws the eyes of noblemen
and women everywhere he goes.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.343
They smile at him.
They bow their heads.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.480
He taunts me
with his dazzle.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.151
Even you.

33:07.086 --> 33:10.489
I will snuff it out
and thrust him into darkness.

33:27.406 --> 33:28.607
Lady Catherine?

33:31.377 --> 33:32.444
Dance for me.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.780
Delight me
with your grace.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.563
What do you hope
to gain by this?

33:53.532 --> 33:55.634
You said that you gave me
cards to play.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.337
How would you
have me play them, Mother?

34:11.883 --> 34:14.253
She means
to influence the King.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.725
But she does not realize
that it is her

34:19.825 --> 34:21.427
who's being dandled
like a puppet.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.514
She is beautiful.

34:48.854 --> 34:51.157
The King seems very taken.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.392
It is an act.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.397
She will be sent away soon.

34:59.165 --> 35:01.167
When the boy
is sent to the Tower.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.269
That is when she will go.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.874
Lady Catherine
and the King.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.344
You must not object.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.182
Object to what?

35:17.549 --> 35:18.850
He is the king.

35:20.186 --> 35:21.320
You must not mind.

35:47.779 --> 35:48.914
Do not rise to it.

35:49.615 --> 35:50.816
He shows his fear.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.887
There is a plot
to rescue you.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.823
The Duchess of Burgundy
is in London.

35:57.923 --> 36:00.726
And my son,
who is with royal midwives,
guarded day and night?

36:01.527 --> 36:03.729
Should I leave him
in Tudor hands
and save my own skin?

36:03.829 --> 36:05.231
I am the king.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.400
And I am winning.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.269
Henry?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.734
Stop stepping around it.
Have you had her?

37:20.406 --> 37:21.407
Answer me!

37:22.941 --> 37:24.310
Oh, your servants may stay.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.778
The whole court knows already.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.453
Do you consider
what I endure?

37:37.756 --> 37:39.325
You disrespect me,

37:40.359 --> 37:42.728
shame me before the court
and everybody gossips.

37:43.795 --> 37:46.432
You did the same to Lady Anne
with your uncle, King Richard.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.500
I was in love
with Richard!

37:52.371 --> 37:53.805
Are you saying
that you love her?

37:53.905 --> 37:55.040
Do you love him?

37:56.475 --> 37:57.443
What?

37:57.543 --> 37:59.511
The boy.
Do you love him?

38:00.846 --> 38:02.481
Of course I don't.

38:03.549 --> 38:06.985
He is my...
He is my burden.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.656
And so is she.

38:12.991 --> 38:15.994
And yours
and all of our children's.

38:17.095 --> 38:19.465
Henry, they are
tearing us apart.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.833
We must find a way
to deal with them.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.501
They called him Edward.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.469
Like my murdered brother.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.039
What do you see?

39:03.675 --> 39:05.043
An innocent?

39:05.444 --> 39:06.645
Your dear sweet nephew?

39:06.745 --> 39:07.913
Of course not.

39:14.686 --> 39:15.954
It is hard, I know.

39:16.822 --> 39:19.425
But the world
in which we move,

39:19.491 --> 39:21.893
we cannot see
an infant as he is,

39:21.993 --> 39:23.529
but as he will become.

39:25.464 --> 39:28.900
Like God, we must see
Alpha and Omega.

39:30.436 --> 39:32.504
The beginning and the end.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.816
My son does his duty
by wooing Lady Catherine.

39:47.753 --> 39:50.456
She cares for him,
he returns it.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.093
Men are weak,

39:56.628 --> 39:58.830
swayed by beauty.

40:00.966 --> 40:03.502
Women must be stronger.

40:29.795 --> 40:30.929
Read it.

40:33.765 --> 40:34.766
Read it out.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.049
"Perkin Warbeck,

40:54.586 --> 40:55.854
"the humble son
of a boatman."

40:55.954 --> 40:57.756
Confess you are a no one.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.893
No threat to us.
And you will live.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.632
Reveal your true identity.

41:18.877 --> 41:19.945
"My name..."

41:26.051 --> 41:27.586
Is Prince Richard of York.

41:29.888 --> 41:31.957
Your brother!
Read it,
and your family will live!

41:32.057 --> 41:33.792
Do not read it, Richard.
Don't deny your birthright.

41:38.764 --> 41:41.700
His child will be brought up
by a family in London.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.569
What?
You have no right!

41:43.602 --> 41:45.003
Oh, we have every right.

41:46.137 --> 41:48.574
If you come here
and you threaten my life

41:48.607 --> 41:50.241
and my family's life,

41:50.341 --> 41:51.577
then your own son
will be forfeit.

41:51.610 --> 41:52.711
No.

41:53.111 --> 41:54.613
God curses you.

41:55.113 --> 41:57.148
He curses you
and you will go to hell.

41:57.849 --> 41:58.817
No!

41:59.150 --> 42:01.019
No, Henry.
Please, Henry.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.721
Please, don't.
I beg you.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.222
Henry, please!

42:18.704 --> 42:19.838
They look at me.

42:20.338 --> 42:22.173
They plot behind my back.

42:23.008 --> 42:24.610
They love him more than me.

42:28.814 --> 42:30.616
What have you done
with his child?

42:31.349 --> 42:34.185
Do not concern yourself
with such matters.

42:36.788 --> 42:37.756
What?

42:40.692 --> 42:42.794
Am I to be protected
from the truth again?

42:43.361 --> 42:45.731
As you and Jasper
always thought I should be.

42:47.799 --> 42:50.168
What else do I not know?

42:53.739 --> 42:56.642
What Jasper would have told me
in the hour before he died.

42:56.708 --> 42:59.077
It hovers on the edges
of my mind.

42:59.344 --> 43:01.713
Sometimes in the night,
I think I hear him whisper it,

43:01.813 --> 43:05.316
but as I lean in
close to his lips,

43:05.416 --> 43:07.318
all I hear
is the rush of the wind.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.020
Nothing.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.927
He would have told you
that he loves you.

43:16.995 --> 43:19.798
That he sacrificed his life
to put you on the throne

43:19.898 --> 43:21.767
and you must keep it,

43:22.333 --> 43:24.002
or you will betray
his memory.

43:24.102 --> 43:25.236
Would he, Mother?

43:28.173 --> 43:30.676
Or is there something
he would tell me

43:30.776 --> 43:32.377
about a game of cards?

43:40.185 --> 43:42.688
Your spirits are
too low this evening.

43:43.421 --> 43:45.190
I will pray
for you at chapel.

43:59.037 --> 44:01.339
If you are found
on the Queen's bed...
What?

44:01.439 --> 44:03.709
What can they do to me
that's worse?

44:04.409 --> 44:06.244
The Duchess of Burgundy
is in London.

44:06.344 --> 44:07.713
She will find out
where he is.

44:07.979 --> 44:09.981
- Please, get up.
- What are you doing?

44:17.455 --> 44:18.924
Comforting her.

44:28.266 --> 44:29.901
How could
you do it, Lizzie?

44:30.001 --> 44:31.803
Let the King's mother
take their son?

44:31.903 --> 44:33.338
You are changing, Maggie,

44:34.305 --> 44:36.742
and I'm not sure I like
who you've become.

44:47.385 --> 44:49.755
Your mother would be
ashamed of you.

45:21.820 --> 45:23.288
"My name is Perkin Warbeck.

45:25.423 --> 45:27.793
"I was born in the town
of Tournai in Flanders.

45:29.861 --> 45:31.362
"My father is a boat-builder,
Jan Warbeck

45:31.462 --> 45:33.198
"and my mother
is Kateryn de Faro.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.005
"I confess that I did
falsely impersonate

45:40.105 --> 45:41.907
"the dead Prince Richard,
the Duke of York,

45:42.007 --> 45:44.309
"and I accept my sentence
from His Grace, King Henry."

45:53.919 --> 45:55.921
At last, he tells the truth.

45:56.521 --> 45:58.824
He is a Flemish peasant.

46:21.379 --> 46:22.347
Maggie?

46:23.614 --> 46:24.983
Maggie!

46:28.186 --> 46:30.521
The Queen says
you insulted her
and defied her.

46:30.621 --> 46:32.523
You must apologize.

46:33.258 --> 46:34.392
Take care

46:34.492 --> 46:35.994
or they will
never let your brother out.

46:36.094 --> 46:38.163
No, they will never
let my brother out
in any case.

46:38.864 --> 46:40.098
I know that now.

46:41.166 --> 46:45.971
And I am tired
of being a trembling flower

46:46.071 --> 46:49.007
and hoping it might make them
feel their conscience.

47:31.016 --> 47:32.583
His confession
has achieved nothing.

47:32.683 --> 47:33.919
No one believes it.

47:34.019 --> 47:35.586
Try him for treason
and be done with him.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.155
I cannot try
him for treason

47:37.255 --> 47:38.957
now that he has read
the proclamation.

47:39.257 --> 47:40.926
He has to be an Englishman,
but to be a traitor.

47:40.992 --> 47:42.160
Just...
Enough!

47:43.962 --> 47:45.396
I'm sick.
This food is bad.

47:46.231 --> 47:48.399
Say it then.
Apologize.

47:49.467 --> 47:51.002
What will happen
to him, Lizzie?

47:51.102 --> 47:52.170
Maggie.

47:52.403 --> 47:53.404
What will happen to the boy?

47:53.504 --> 47:55.206
You should think
about whose side you're on.

47:55.306 --> 47:58.977
I am on Arthur's side,
and Harry's.

47:59.077 --> 48:01.046
And that is
why I must say this.

48:03.014 --> 48:04.515
You once told me
of a curse

48:04.615 --> 48:06.284
laid by your mother
and yourself

48:06.384 --> 48:08.286
that whoever killed
those two boys in the Tower

48:08.386 --> 48:10.155
would lose the male line
of their family.

48:10.255 --> 48:13.191
Lady Margaret
killed your brother Edward.

48:13.658 --> 48:16.962
So, one of your boys
is already in its shadow.

48:16.995 --> 48:18.329
King Richard killed the boys.

48:19.297 --> 48:20.531
Not Henry's mother.

48:21.666 --> 48:23.301
His own son died
because of it.

48:23.401 --> 48:25.136
The curse is done.
You never once
believed that.

48:25.236 --> 48:27.272
I thought
I was in love with him.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.108
I would not see it then.

48:31.209 --> 48:34.045
You believe that
because it brings you comfort,

48:34.612 --> 48:36.181
but it is a lie.

48:40.085 --> 48:41.352
Don't start.

48:42.153 --> 48:43.354
He laughs at me.

48:55.700 --> 48:58.069
Lady Margaret killed
the first prince

48:58.169 --> 48:59.904
and if you even think
there is a chance

49:00.005 --> 49:01.172
that that boy
is your brother Richard,

49:01.272 --> 49:02.240
then you cannot
hurt him, Lizzie.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.277
Or the curse
falls on your sons as well.

49:06.777 --> 49:08.679
Your Grace, my wife is feeling
the effects of wine, she...

49:08.779 --> 49:10.481
You know
he is your brother, Lizzie.

49:11.449 --> 49:12.617
I know you do.

49:14.719 --> 49:16.021
They're poisoned!

49:16.587 --> 49:17.622
They're poisoned!

49:20.091 --> 49:21.359
He puts poison in my clothes
to make me sick!

49:21.459 --> 49:23.294
What?
He puts poison in my clothes

49:23.394 --> 49:24.395
to make me sick!
Get him out of here.

49:34.405 --> 49:35.640
You would like the crown?

49:35.740 --> 49:37.042
This crown?

49:37.075 --> 49:38.543
This one?

49:40.178 --> 49:41.346
Henry!

49:48.519 --> 49:50.155
Beat him.

49:53.258 --> 49:54.692
Henry! Henry!

49:55.393 --> 49:57.128
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

49:57.228 --> 49:58.429
Stop it, please.

50:01.666 --> 50:02.667
Lizzie.

50:03.668 --> 50:04.669
Tend to him.

50:05.170 --> 50:06.471
Tend to his wounds.

50:18.649 --> 50:19.650
I am hated.

50:21.086 --> 50:22.587
The more I try to break him,
the more he is beloved.

50:22.687 --> 50:25.123
No. No, you are king.

50:25.223 --> 50:27.292
They whisper.
They say God hates me.

50:27.392 --> 50:29.026
Shh!
This is madness.

50:29.560 --> 50:32.197
They would kill me
and our sons.

50:32.297 --> 50:33.298
No.

50:33.398 --> 50:34.699
Henry, don't do this.

50:36.301 --> 50:37.302
Don't do this.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.755
The boy will be allowed to see
his wife this evening.

51:01.226 --> 51:02.393
This is no trick.

51:03.261 --> 51:05.363
You wanted me to act
and I am acting.

51:07.465 --> 51:09.334
Here is the key.

51:30.321 --> 51:31.322
Richard.

51:32.223 --> 51:33.224
Oh, God!

51:36.461 --> 51:37.428
It's Maggie.

51:41.832 --> 51:43.268
- Cathy.
- She's safe.

51:43.368 --> 51:44.569
You are to see her.

51:45.203 --> 51:46.404
I'm to help you.

51:47.772 --> 51:48.873
"Richard."

51:50.875 --> 51:52.343
You believe me then?

51:53.311 --> 51:54.445
Yes, I do.

52:14.232 --> 52:15.700
Come on, get up.

52:49.234 --> 52:50.435
Quickly.
There is a fire.

52:51.702 --> 52:53.238
It started
in the Royal Wardrobe.

52:53.271 --> 52:55.240
If you go now,
everyone will believe
you burnt to death.

52:55.273 --> 52:56.307
"You."

52:56.407 --> 52:58.443
You cannot bring yourself
to say my name.

53:00.478 --> 53:01.546
Even now.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.482
This is why
you let him come to me?

53:05.516 --> 53:06.551
So we could leave?

53:06.917 --> 53:08.719
You must disappear forever.

53:09.620 --> 53:10.888
Give up your claim.

53:11.889 --> 53:14.492
From this night on,
you are never seen again
at any court

53:14.592 --> 53:16.727
because you died here
in the fire.

53:16.827 --> 53:18.263
I need your word.

53:18.296 --> 53:19.764
Where are we supposed to go?

53:19.864 --> 53:20.965
Buy land.

53:21.699 --> 53:23.401
A farm.
Sire healthy children.

53:23.501 --> 53:24.869
Live a long life
somewhere far away.

53:24.969 --> 53:26.637
With no name or rank?

53:27.372 --> 53:30.275
It has to be now,
this moment.

53:30.341 --> 53:32.277
While there is panic.
I am giving you a chance.

53:32.377 --> 53:33.611
What about our son?

53:34.745 --> 53:37.515
He is a...
A York prince.

53:37.882 --> 53:40.551
He cannot grow up herding
cows and burning peat.

53:40.918 --> 53:42.553
But he will grow up.

53:44.322 --> 53:47.325
That is what I'm offering you
if you leave now.

53:47.625 --> 53:50.361
You would not go
against your husband
for a boat builder's son

53:50.461 --> 53:52.463
but you would
to save your brother.

53:53.731 --> 53:56.534
You know that I am Richard.
Please, just go!

53:59.036 --> 54:00.538
And be safe.

54:03.374 --> 54:05.810
I will see your child is
safely brought back to you.

54:09.347 --> 54:10.648
You must come with me.

54:12.483 --> 54:13.618
Cry and mourn his death,

54:13.718 --> 54:15.720
and tomorrow
you may leave and join him.

54:18.055 --> 54:19.957
It is your choice, Richard.

54:20.758 --> 54:22.393
You must decide.

54:34.939 --> 54:35.940
Come on!

54:36.807 --> 54:38.643
A chain! Form a chain!

54:38.743 --> 54:41.412
More hands.
We need more hands!

54:41.612 --> 54:42.847
Give it to me!

54:43.548 --> 54:44.815
Did everyone get out?

54:45.716 --> 54:46.784
Form a chain!

54:46.884 --> 54:48.353
Where is...
Where's the boy?

54:48.386 --> 54:49.354
Where is he?

54:49.920 --> 54:51.856
He was locked
inside the Royal Wardrobe!

54:51.956 --> 54:53.724
That is where
the fire started.

54:54.425 --> 54:55.426
Quickly.

54:55.526 --> 54:57.362
He started it himself.

54:58.629 --> 54:59.864
It is God's work.

55:01.466 --> 55:02.633
He is dead.

55:04.402 --> 55:05.670
Is there anyone else in there?

55:21.919 --> 55:26.624
I am the son
of King Edward the IV
and Queen Elizabeth Woodville!

55:28.826 --> 55:32.763
I live through battle,
walk through fire

55:32.863 --> 55:35.500
and I will have
the throne of England!
