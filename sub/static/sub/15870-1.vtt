00:33.117 --> 00:36.035
As in every stone of this size,
there is a flaw.

00:36.120 --> 00:40.039
- A flaw?
- The slightest flaw, Your Excellency.

00:40.124 --> 00:41.791
If you look deep into the stone,

00:41.875 --> 00:44.293
you will perceive
the tiniest discoloration.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.046
It resembles an animal.

00:47.756 --> 00:50.091
- An animal?
- A leaping panther.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.679
Yes. A pink panther.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.308
Come here, Dala.

01:05.649 --> 01:08.401
A gift for your father
from his grateful people.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.486
Someday it will be yours.

01:10.612 --> 01:13.072
The most fabulous diamond
in all the world.

01:13.157 --> 01:14.741
Come closer.

07:05.258 --> 07:09.637
Okay. Thanks a lot, fellas.
Don't forget to take the wardrobe back.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.347
How do you want them,
matte or glossy?

07:11.473 --> 07:13.015
I want it right away.
I'm in a hurry.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.101
You can't rush a genius.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.311
I'll rush.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.439
Don't forget
about the wardrobe.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.615
What you doing?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.952
Where is everybody?

07:37.916 --> 07:40.626
- Come out of there!
- Who is it?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.962
Come out,
or we'll bust the door in!

07:43.046 --> 07:45.047
Just a minute.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.050
- Can I help you?
- Where is he?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.219
- Where's who?
- George Litton.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.681
He owes me 40 grand,
and nobody welshes on Big Joe.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.851
Look, Big Joe,
I'm not a bill collector.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.228
I'm a photographer.
Just took his picture.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.522
- What kind of a picture?
- Graduation picture.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.566
- His what?
- Graduation.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.442
Get him!

08:45.817 --> 08:48.444
They're worth half a million.
We'll settle for 300,000.

08:48.570 --> 08:52.615
I'll do what I can,
but the merchandise is extremely hot.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.471
You stay here.
Come with me.

09:29.027 --> 09:30.277
Come on!

09:54.386 --> 09:56.011
- Pardon, madame.
- Certainly.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.181
She's gone down.
Come on!

10:24.791 --> 10:26.959
We must find that woman.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.548
What did you say?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.675
We don't have
much of a description.

10:34.759 --> 10:40.055
About 5'7", black hair,
wearing a light beige coat.

10:40.181 --> 10:43.309
The fools let that fence escape.
He might have talked.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.269
- We will catch him.
- We must.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.770
We must find that woman.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.815
She is our first positive link
with the Phantom.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.821
- Yes?
<i>- Your wife to see you, Inspector.</i>

10:55.905 --> 10:58.574
Send her in, please.
Henri, that will be all.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.624
- Hello, my darling.
- My angel.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.927
Amber, how are you?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.110
Hello, Duchess.
So glad you could come.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.862
Have fun, children.
How are you?

12:18.988 --> 12:20.906
Hello, darling!

12:21.157 --> 12:22.574
You know Monica?

12:22.659 --> 12:25.411
Of course. You were
simply stunning in your last film.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.874
- What's he say?
- He says hello,

12:30.959 --> 12:33.043
and he would like you
to meet his cousin.

12:35.797 --> 12:39.091
- His third cousin.
- That does make a difference.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.932
- Who is that?
- Princess Dala.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.060
Excuse me.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.201
Yes?

13:08.705 --> 13:10.038
Miss Angela Dunning.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.921
- Yes?
- Your Highness?

13:18.047 --> 13:19.089
Yes.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.426
Here I am again, Your Highness.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.596
I was having a cocktail party,
and I saw you driving by...

13:26.931 --> 13:31.226
I just know you'd enjoy it.
Yes, you'd just love it...

13:42.697 --> 13:44.698
Your Highness.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.202
Hello there.

13:48.286 --> 13:51.079
I can't tell you
what an honor this is.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.665
Everyone's just dying to meet you.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.578
- Good morning, Your Highness.
- Good morning.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.205
- You're a wonderful skier.
- Thank you.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.331
Help!

15:17.584 --> 15:22.129
Somebody's taking my sleigh.
Amber! My dog.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.590
Leave this to me, ma'am.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.850
- What happened?
- I don't know.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.979
There was a man with a gun,
and he took the sleigh and Amber.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.324
We'll only be here a few days.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.660
It will be a wonderful chance
for a beautiful vacation.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.707
Excuse me.
My leg is caught.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.959
I apologize
for this inconvenience.

16:02.462 --> 16:06.089
Do you know who that was?
That was Sir Charles Litton.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.216
- Really?
- Yes.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.428
I am Inspector Clouseau.
This is Madame Clouseau.

16:15.558 --> 16:16.933
All right. Thank you.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.106
I'm sorry, my darling.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.234
- It's all right, my darling.
- Excuse me.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.780
Do you know that
you're really amazing?

16:29.864 --> 16:31.114
So you've said.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.328
How you can manage
on a police inspector's salary.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.497
How many women could save
enough out of their housekeeping

16:38.581 --> 16:41.291
to buy such a beautiful
mink coat as this?

16:41.376 --> 16:43.126
It's not easy.

16:43.211 --> 16:46.129
You are a constant
and desirable contradiction.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.757
I'm simply
a woman in love, my darling.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.092
My darling.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.850
I'm sorry, my darling.
Please excuse me.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.185
It's all right.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.814
Did I hurt you?
Are you all right?

17:03.898 --> 17:05.649
- Yes, I'm fine.
- You sure?

17:05.733 --> 17:08.318
- Yes, I am.
- My darling, I'm so sorry.

17:10.947 --> 17:14.282
I have a little business
to conclude with the manager.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.617
Yes?

17:17.370 --> 17:19.746
After which, I'll return
to you immediately.

17:20.665 --> 17:21.957
Bye, darling.

17:35.972 --> 17:36.972
It's all right.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.170
- How did it go?
- Perfectly.

18:17.889 --> 18:18.930
Come in.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.857
Princess Dala
is concerned about your injuries.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.609
Please thank the princess.

18:30.693 --> 18:33.153
Tell her there's nothing
to be concerned about.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.197
It's really not too serious.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.574
In that case, Her Highness
has instructed me

18:37.700 --> 18:40.827
to invite you for dinner
this evening, 8:00 at her chalet.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.871
I'd be delighted to come.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.260
You know Signor Tucker
from Lloyd's of London.

18:57.345 --> 18:58.845
- Hello.
- Hello, old bean.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.806
Your company
insures the Pink Panther.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.182
Yes, for half a million.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.017
- Pounds?
- Sterling.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.436
The Phantom could not resist
the Pink Panther.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.647
He will most certainly
make an attempt.

19:08.731 --> 19:11.525
When he does, I shall
be waiting for him. Excuse me.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.193
If I understand your theory,

19:13.277 --> 19:14.778
the Phantom is
one of Miss Dunning's guests.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.655
That is the theory.
I would like to have from you

19:16.739 --> 19:19.699
the names of those guests,
also the location of their rooms.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.117
Of course!

19:21.202 --> 19:24.120
I assume that the Princess Dala
has the jewel with her.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.665
She'd only tell me
it was in a safe place.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.751
I suppose if it isn't here,
it's at her villa in Rome.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.837
My men are watching that villa.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.965
With such planning,
how can the Phantom succeed?

19:35.091 --> 19:38.260
With such planning,
he's succeeded for 20 years.

19:38.386 --> 19:41.763
It's a mistake to underestimate him,
as the inspector can tell you.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.891
The shrewdest, most ingenious
criminal in all the world.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.685
- And you have never seen him?
- I've seen him once.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.271
Five years ago,
got a fleeting glimpse...

19:50.273 --> 19:51.940
Excuse me.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.192
Got a fleeting glimpse of him
as he made his getaway.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.570
In a strange way,
I admire that man.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.740
He has... how would you say...
a unique flair for the dramatic.

20:01.951 --> 20:05.412
- He waved good-bye to me.
- Fascinating.

20:06.455 --> 20:10.709
But this time, gentlemen,
I shall be waving good-bye to him...

20:10.793 --> 20:13.003
on his way to prison.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.089
Good evening.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.637
Make yourself comfortable.
Her Highness will join you in a moment.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.640
- May I give you a drink?
- I'd like a brandy, thank you.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.198
Your Highness.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.159
Good evening, Sir Charles.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.495
Any news from the police
about your dear little dog?

20:47.622 --> 20:49.915
They expect I'll receive
a ransom note.

20:49.999 --> 20:53.043
I am deeply grateful
for what you tried to do.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.502
Ma'am, it was nothing.

20:55.838 --> 20:56.922
Thank you.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.549
- Please sit down.
- Aren't you drinking?

20:59.634 --> 21:01.885
- I don't drink.
- Not ever?

21:02.929 --> 21:06.348
I'm quite content with reality.
I have no need for escape.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.475
I enjoy reality
as much as the next man.

21:08.559 --> 21:09.768
In my case, fortunately,

21:09.852 --> 21:12.938
reality includes a good stiff belt
every now and then.

21:13.022 --> 21:17.192
- On the other hand, I don't smoke.
- You're right. It's a nasty habit.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.778
Here's to those nasty little habits
that we hold so dear.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.655
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

21:21.739 --> 21:23.782
I beg your pardon?

21:24.367 --> 21:27.118
Let's just say
in this case, it means...

21:27.203 --> 21:30.080
your health and thank you
for inviting me to dinner.

21:30.164 --> 21:34.292
It's not often I have the chance
to dine alone with a beautiful princess.

21:34.377 --> 21:38.588
I hate to disappoint you,
but I'm afraid this isn't the night.

21:38.673 --> 21:43.718
- But I understood that...
- We're having dinner, but not alone.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.644
At last! Hello!

21:52.728 --> 21:55.814
We've been through icicles
up to our you-know-whats!

21:55.898 --> 21:58.233
Your Highness!

21:58.317 --> 22:02.988
I think it's too darling of you
to invite me here tonight.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.907
- You've made Cortina for me.
- Hello, lover.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.534
Hello, dear boy.

22:08.703 --> 22:11.079
Don't you move a muscle, darling.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.540
Isn't he wonderful, Your Highness?

22:13.624 --> 22:16.501
Such a magnificent sacrifice.

22:19.839 --> 22:20.880
Good evening, sir.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.539
May I have a cigarette,
my darling?

22:54.623 --> 22:55.790
Yes, of course, my darling.

22:58.002 --> 23:00.086
- There you are, my love.
- Thank you.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.798
- Yes, sir?
- Scotch on the rocks.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.972
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.974
Thank you very much.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.979
I'm looking for my uncle,
Sir Charles Litton.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.941
- Darling.
- May I get you some water?

23:23.652 --> 23:27.739
- Hold your hands over your head.
- Yes, my darling. Bend forward.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.241
- Darling, I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

23:30.326 --> 23:32.035
Are you all right, my darling?

23:32.828 --> 23:33.870
What?

23:34.705 --> 23:36.831
- My darling?
- I'll be right back.

23:36.916 --> 23:37.999
Yes, darling.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.177
Please.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.564
She's got a cough
in her throat, you know.

24:08.989 --> 24:12.367
And what do you think?
She turned out to be a man!

24:12.451 --> 24:14.744
It's true! It's quite true!

24:14.829 --> 24:18.164
Your Highness, you really must
let me give you a party.

24:18.249 --> 24:21.835
I can positively guarantee
it'll be a party to end all parties.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.086
I'm sure it will.

24:23.212 --> 24:25.088
Perhaps Her Highness
has other plans.

24:25.214 --> 24:29.509
On the contrary. Sounds like fun.
Will you include Sir Charles?

24:29.593 --> 24:32.762
No. Charles is
having a fling in Capri.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.264
He has his own parties.

24:34.390 --> 24:37.058
Yes, I've read about
some of his parties.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.811
They're wonderful.
We call him the juggler.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.147
I've never really known
a man like him.

24:42.231 --> 24:46.067
He can keep ten girls in the air
at once and make each one happy.

24:46.193 --> 24:49.154
Amazing. Sort of
a contemporary Don Juan.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.655
- That's it.
- But there's a difference.

24:50.739 --> 24:54.534
Sir Charles' predecessor was forced
to climb balconies and fight duels,

24:54.618 --> 24:58.288
and, as I understand it,
keep his women separate.

24:58.372 --> 25:01.499
Charles, on the other hand,
drives a Ferrari,

25:01.584 --> 25:04.627
enters with a key,
and resorts to collective bargaining.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.672
But they both have
something in common.

25:07.756 --> 25:11.676
- What's that, Your Highness?
- Maybe it's best forgotten.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.928
Don't be silly.
Charles doesn't mind.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.347
Everyone takes a potshot
at Charles sooner or later.

25:16.432 --> 25:17.724
Go ahead, ma'am, shoot.

25:17.808 --> 25:20.727
It seems to me
any middle-aged bachelor

25:20.811 --> 25:24.355
who has never desired
the basic rewards of wife and family

25:24.440 --> 25:27.817
and finds it necessary to occupy
the major portion of his life

25:27.985 --> 25:29.944
making one conquest after another

25:30.029 --> 25:33.698
is trying to prove something
he can never possibly prove.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.992
- And what's that?
- That he's a man.

25:36.076 --> 25:38.411
You're joking!

25:38.495 --> 25:41.497
It's somewhat complicated,
but basically sound.

25:41.624 --> 25:44.375
- Well, Charles?
- Not very original.

25:44.460 --> 25:47.545
That theory has become
rather a tired Freudian cliché.

25:47.630 --> 25:51.132
- But true.
- I've never been on the couch.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.676
Not true.
That's part of your problem.

25:54.178 --> 25:57.639
How refreshing to find royalty
possessed of such a perceptive wit.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.808
Charles, you going
to take that lying down?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.143
Yes, as a matter of fact.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.605
My leg is hurting rather badly.
May I be excused?

26:08.692 --> 26:11.402
- I'll be damned.
- I can't believe it.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.489
- The leg?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

26:15.491 --> 26:19.077
That goes to prove
there's a first time for everything.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.787
Got a terrific laugh, anyway.

26:27.670 --> 26:28.711
Simone!

27:38.282 --> 27:41.367
Jacques, I'm still cold.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.619
Perhaps another blanket,
my darling.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.206
All right, darling.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.744
There you are, my darling.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.751
- Yes, darling?
- The light.

28:51.980 --> 28:55.358
- What?
- I'm sorry. It doesn't help.

28:56.652 --> 28:58.903
Perhaps a hot glass of milk.

29:00.656 --> 29:04.992
But I think the room service
has finished, my love.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.537
Yes, of course.
I forgot.

29:07.621 --> 29:08.663
You see?

29:09.623 --> 29:11.082
They're all gone now.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.252
Well, no matter.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.673
You see...

29:20.843 --> 29:24.887
If my little pigeon
wants a glass of milk...

29:25.013 --> 29:27.014
she shall have one...

29:28.892 --> 29:32.728
...even if I have to force them
to open the kitchen.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.859
She shall have milk
wherever she goes, hot or cold.

29:37.985 --> 29:40.486
- Hot.
- I know. That's what I said.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.035
Open the door.

30:30.871 --> 30:33.956
Darling, I need to talk to you.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.668
I've sent Jacques for some milk.
I only have a moment.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.755
- Let's make the most of it.
- No! Stop it.

30:41.048 --> 30:43.758
- It was your idea.
- Yes, but you're the wrong...

30:43.884 --> 30:47.094
The wrong what? Man?
You think I was...

30:47.179 --> 30:50.932
No. I thought you were exactly
who you are, but I'm too impulsive.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.725
This is not the right way.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.269
Another time.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.851
- Here you are, my beloved.
- Thank you.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.146
It's all they had.

31:39.982 --> 31:43.734
Can't get a thing in this hotel.
I had to force them to give me that.

31:43.819 --> 31:44.944
Never mind.

31:56.790 --> 31:59.625
My darling, lovely darling.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.836
What's wrong?

32:01.920 --> 32:05.339
My darling, your feet
are like two icicles.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.592
Have you been out of bed
or something?

32:07.676 --> 32:09.135
No, of course not.

32:11.013 --> 32:14.724
Anyway, you warm them on me.

32:31.408 --> 32:34.535
This is Princess Dala.
My guests have gone,

32:34.620 --> 32:37.538
and I thought perhaps
you would come back and have a drink.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.624
I would feel better
if we're friends.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.959
I would, too,
and I'd love to come,

32:42.044 --> 32:44.503
but my leg is rather painful.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.048
I'm sorry. Another time.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.425
Why don't you come up here?

32:49.551 --> 32:51.594
My leg is only bad
if I walk too much.

32:51.720 --> 32:55.139
Maybe you could do the walking
and I could do the drinking.

32:56.141 --> 33:01.187
Unless you think it would be indiscreet
to come to a man's room.

33:01.271 --> 33:04.899
I'll be there in five minutes.
Good-bye, Sir Charles.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.067
Good-bye.

33:38.016 --> 33:42.603
I don't know what's wrong.
I'm just a bundle of nerves.

33:42.688 --> 33:46.315
Don't worry. We've solved
that problem before.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.150
- You don't mean...
- Of course.

33:48.276 --> 33:51.195
- I don't think you should.
- Don't worry, my darling.

33:51.279 --> 33:54.865
- I shall do it ever so softly.
- Jacques, are you sure?

33:54.950 --> 33:57.785
My darling, of course.
It's always worked before.

33:57.911 --> 34:00.079
There's no reason
why it should not work now.

34:00.163 --> 34:03.624
You just relax
and leave everything to me.

34:15.804 --> 34:16.804
Jacques?

34:17.973 --> 34:21.225
- Yes, my darling?
- I don't think it's such a good idea.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.979
You mean that it's not helping?

34:25.063 --> 34:28.983
I'm afraid not.
I think I'll just take a sleeping pill.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.237
Very well, my darling.
I'll get it for you.

34:33.321 --> 34:37.616
And why don't you take one yourself?
You need the rest, you know.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.329
Yes, I think perhaps I will.

35:07.689 --> 35:08.981
Here, my darling.

35:13.528 --> 35:16.655
- Thank you, my angel.
<i>- Thank you, my angel.</i>

35:39.888 --> 35:41.764
My poor Jacques.

35:42.557 --> 35:43.724
No matter.

35:43.850 --> 35:47.061
When you've seen one Stradivarius,
you've seen them all.

35:56.738 --> 35:59.240
I hadn't realized it was so late.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.785
Come in, sit down, relax.
Have a nice glass of champagne.

36:02.869 --> 36:06.205
- I told you I don't drink.
- Champagne's not drinking.

36:06.289 --> 36:09.834
That's the minimum of alcohol
and the maximum of companionship.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.961
It's still against my principles.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.421
That's too bad.
I thought it might break the ice.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.383
- You took me to task rather properly.
- No, thank you.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.802
I thought your analysis
was very perceptive.

36:19.886 --> 36:23.013
- But not very polite.
- No, it wasn't.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.558
- What made you do it?
- I resented you.

36:25.642 --> 36:29.061
I find it hard to understand
a man of your reputation.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.146
We both have reputations.

36:31.273 --> 36:33.858
Perhaps mine is a little more
highly publicized than yours,

36:33.942 --> 36:36.026
but you have presented the press
with a rather definite image.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.236
Yes, I know.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.113
- Are you?
- What?

36:39.197 --> 36:42.074
What they call you.
The virgin queen.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.410
I'm not the queen.

36:46.371 --> 36:47.997
That's only half an answer.

36:48.123 --> 36:51.834
The strong-willed ruler of ten million
people sitting in her ivory tower,

36:51.960 --> 36:55.629
untouched, unwed,
and unapproachable.

36:56.298 --> 37:00.384
If you had known my father,
you would understand me.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.595
He was an absolute ruler.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.972
He governed his people
with an iron hand,

37:05.098 --> 37:08.309
but he gave me a white pony
for my fifth birthday.

37:08.435 --> 37:10.728
He was wrong about many things,

37:10.812 --> 37:14.565
but he made his decisions according
to the ways of his predecessors.

37:14.649 --> 37:18.736
I learned the way of the West,
so I've become a little of both...

37:18.862 --> 37:20.321
a paradox...

37:20.447 --> 37:23.908
and it is hard
to reconcile the extremes.

37:23.992 --> 37:27.620
Have a glass of champagne.
Does wonders for extremes.

37:27.704 --> 37:30.956
It's been known to launch
some lasting friendships.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.713
- Don't you trust me?
- No.

37:38.381 --> 37:41.091
- Are you afraid?
- No.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.345
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

37:53.355 --> 37:57.650
I was three years old
when I rode my first elephant.

37:57.734 --> 38:02.905
I was six when I went
on my first "safrari."

38:05.033 --> 38:07.409
"Frasari."

38:07.494 --> 38:09.828
Wild-animal hunt.

38:09.913 --> 38:13.624
And I was ten
when I bagged my first tiger.

38:13.708 --> 38:17.503
But I'll never forget
my lovely little pony.

38:17.587 --> 38:19.421
When did you bag him?

38:20.507 --> 38:24.718
You're making fun again.
You really don't like animals.

38:24.803 --> 38:28.097
Don't trust a man
who doesn't care about animals.

38:30.100 --> 38:34.103
And don't trust an animal
who doesn't care about people.

38:36.523 --> 38:38.524
Why you don't like people?

38:38.608 --> 38:40.401
I like people.

38:43.238 --> 38:46.699
That's supposed to be me
who doesn't...

38:46.783 --> 38:49.410
like people, right?

38:49.536 --> 38:51.412
If you say so.

38:51.621 --> 38:55.958
I don't say so.
You say so.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.876
- Right?
- I said so.

38:57.961 --> 39:01.588
And another thing you did,
you didn't tell me the truth.

39:02.841 --> 39:06.427
- About what?
- About champagne. About this.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.431
Boy, did you fib.

39:11.391 --> 39:12.850
You said...

39:14.602 --> 39:16.770
Something about extremes.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.440
It does wonders for them.

39:19.566 --> 39:24.111
It does more than that.
It makes your lips numb.

39:24.237 --> 39:28.490
I can't feel them.
Are they still there?

39:31.119 --> 39:33.162
Let's have a look.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.209
You didn't tell me about that part.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.471
Won't do you any good.
I can't feel it.

39:54.976 --> 39:58.103
Hoisted on your own petard.

39:59.773 --> 40:03.317
Don't try to say that
when you haven't got any lips.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.158
I'm plastered.

40:12.535 --> 40:15.913
- If that's the right expression.
- That's the right expression.

40:15.997 --> 40:19.583
You're a fraud and a liar.

40:20.668 --> 40:23.712
And you think you are going
to take advantage of me.

40:23.838 --> 40:26.423
<i>No. You think I am.</i>

40:26.508 --> 40:30.385
I know you are.
That's the plan, isn't it?

40:31.387 --> 40:33.514
Feed me champagne...

40:33.598 --> 40:35.599
break down the inhibitions...

40:35.683 --> 40:36.975
and tallyho.

40:43.608 --> 40:44.691
No more virgin queen.

40:48.196 --> 40:49.905
We're all out of champagne.

40:49.989 --> 40:52.157
- I'll get another bottle.
- No!

40:53.868 --> 40:56.328
I prefer to remain conscious

40:56.412 --> 41:00.249
so I may view
the attempted seduction firsthand.

41:01.543 --> 41:04.503
Because you've got
a surprise coming, Charlie.

41:05.588 --> 41:08.048
I got friends in low places.

41:08.675 --> 41:12.386
You make one pass at me,
and I'll sic him on you.

41:12.512 --> 41:14.138
Understand?

41:14.222 --> 41:17.766
If he moves a muscle,
attack without mercy.

41:19.394 --> 41:20.894
You see, Charlie?

41:20.979 --> 41:25.274
You're outnumbered,
two against one.

41:25.358 --> 41:27.484
And I don't care if you can juggle.

41:39.956 --> 41:42.457
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.627
Cat got your tongue?

41:46.754 --> 41:51.175
Got his tongue?
My friend says he hasn't got it.

41:51.259 --> 41:55.179
Then why don't you
say something?

41:55.263 --> 41:57.264
I couldn't think
of anything to say.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.934
Why don't you kiss me again?

42:03.938 --> 42:04.938
All right.

42:13.239 --> 42:16.992
You know what, Charlie?
I could feel that one.

42:18.828 --> 42:19.995
Again.

42:30.590 --> 42:35.427
If I were my father,
I'd have you tortured.

42:35.511 --> 42:38.972
No. If you were your father,

42:39.057 --> 42:41.225
I doubt very much
if I would have kissed you.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.645
Good thinking, Charlie.

42:44.729 --> 42:48.440
Then, now that we've
straightened out who I am,

42:48.524 --> 42:50.651
what are you
going to do about it?

43:01.829 --> 43:06.416
What kind of a friend are you?
You were supposed to attack.

43:09.295 --> 43:12.547
No friends, Charlie.
Now you got me outnumbered.

43:12.632 --> 43:14.132
I thought we were friends.

43:15.468 --> 43:18.512
You are the juggler.
I am the virgin queen.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.597
Somebody's got to win.

43:20.682 --> 43:23.684
Friends don't act like that.

43:23.768 --> 43:28.355
Want to be friends, Charlie,
or want to win?

43:34.070 --> 43:35.862
You really want to know?

43:51.754 --> 43:52.879
What's wrong?

43:53.631 --> 43:57.259
I don't feel...
I think I'm going...

43:57.343 --> 43:58.510
Good-bye, Charlie.

44:02.890 --> 44:03.932
Here...

44:11.399 --> 44:14.276
Darling. Dala.

44:16.237 --> 44:19.573
Ma'am? Your Highness!

45:55.920 --> 45:57.504
Thank you. Up.

45:59.841 --> 46:01.007
There we are.

46:05.096 --> 46:07.097
Hello, Uncle Charles.

46:08.391 --> 46:09.599
George!

46:22.530 --> 46:26.450
Good morning.
Listen, what about this nephew?

46:26.534 --> 46:28.452
- How did you find out?
- I met him in the bar last night.

46:28.536 --> 46:30.579
That's what I was trying
to explain at the window.

46:30.663 --> 46:31.663
What happened to you?

46:31.747 --> 46:34.291
Jacques dragged me
back to the hotel.

46:34.375 --> 46:37.043
- I looked everywhere for you.
- I looked everywhere for you.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.713
I nearly climbed in bed
with your nephew.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.965
- You what?
- Don't worry. I took care of it.

46:42.967 --> 46:44.384
He had a heavy night.

46:44.469 --> 46:46.386
I almost put the princess
in bed with him.

46:46.512 --> 46:48.889
- Really?
- What you got there?

46:48.973 --> 46:50.807
A note to Uncle Charles.

46:51.434 --> 46:54.227
"Dear Uncle Charles,
don't worry about a thing.

46:54.312 --> 46:57.898
I've gone to see the princess
to apologize for last night."

46:57.982 --> 47:00.025
Apologize for what?
Nothing happened.

47:00.109 --> 47:01.902
It must have been
rather embarrassing,

47:01.986 --> 47:04.029
expecting to end up
with one man...

47:04.113 --> 47:06.114
She didn't expect
to wind up with anybody.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.366
She had a couple glasses
of champagne and had to rest.

47:08.451 --> 47:09.701
Of course.

47:09.785 --> 47:11.536
Think of him
taking over my room.

47:11.621 --> 47:14.664
- Didn't you know he was coming?
- No. I haven't seen him for years.

47:14.749 --> 47:16.124
But who is he?
What is he?

47:16.209 --> 47:18.001
He is my nephew, really.

47:18.085 --> 47:20.337
He's my late brother's son.

47:20.421 --> 47:24.132
I've been responsible for him
since he was ten years old.

47:24.217 --> 47:26.551
I sent him to all
the best schools in America.

47:26.636 --> 47:28.637
He did very well,
as a matter of fact.

47:28.763 --> 47:31.473
He's just graduated
from college. Look.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.187
Isn't he a bit old for school?

47:37.271 --> 47:38.772
He did two years in the army.

47:38.856 --> 47:42.859
He lost a whole year after that
to some strange tropical disease.

47:42.944 --> 47:44.819
He's certainly attractive.

47:44.946 --> 47:46.821
There's a slight
family resemblance.

47:46.948 --> 47:48.323
Apart from that,
we have nothing in common.

47:48.407 --> 47:51.535
He's dedicated to education,
passed at the top of his class.

47:51.619 --> 47:52.994
Cares nothing about sports.

47:53.079 --> 47:55.997
In his letters, he's never
once mentioned girls.

47:56.082 --> 47:59.709
He may not mention them, but he's got
a pretty good idea what they are.

47:59.794 --> 48:01.211
I nearly didn't
get out of here last night.

48:01.295 --> 48:02.837
You're joking.

48:02.964 --> 48:05.632
It was a relief to get back
to Jacques and his fiddle.

48:05.716 --> 48:08.134
If we don't do something soon,
he's gonna ruin everything.

48:08.219 --> 48:11.555
- If I don't do something.
- It shouldn't be too difficult.

48:11.639 --> 48:14.266
He's just a young man
who's not been out in the world.

48:14.350 --> 48:17.477
That's because he's been
spending his time in the bedroom.

48:17.603 --> 48:20.647
- I'm surprised at you.
- I can handle it.

48:20.773 --> 48:22.607
As a matter of fact,
it might be rather intriguing,

48:22.692 --> 48:26.069
particularly if the family resemblance
goes deeper than you think.

48:26.153 --> 48:27.779
I'm envious.

48:27.863 --> 48:30.949
It seems that we're somewhat
in the same spot, my love.

48:31.033 --> 48:33.577
You envy George,
and I envy the princess.

48:36.664 --> 48:39.082
I really don't know
what I'm going to do yet.

48:39.166 --> 48:42.502
I might go back to college
and get my doctorate.

48:42.587 --> 48:44.588
But I'm torn.

48:44.672 --> 48:47.299
I feel there's so many things
to be done in the world,

48:47.383 --> 48:49.718
so many backward countries
where I might be useful.

48:49.802 --> 48:52.429
I've even been considering
the Peace Corps.

48:52.513 --> 48:55.098
You're certainly not
much like your uncle.

48:55.182 --> 48:57.183
I don't know
too much about my uncle,

48:57.310 --> 48:59.102
except what I've read
in newspapers and magazines.

48:59.186 --> 49:02.022
- One mustn't judge by that.
- No?

49:02.106 --> 49:05.400
After all, whatever I am today,
he made it possible.

49:05.526 --> 49:08.528
I guess everyone has
at least one redeeming quality.

49:08.654 --> 49:09.904
Yes.

49:16.829 --> 49:19.039
Good morning, Your Highness.
Hair of the dog.

49:19.206 --> 49:21.458
- May I present Madame Clouseau?
- Good morning.

49:21.542 --> 49:23.543
This is my
Americanized nephew George.

49:23.628 --> 49:25.211
We met at the bar last night.

49:25.338 --> 49:27.797
- How is your cough?
- It's completely gone. Thanks.

49:27.882 --> 49:29.215
Have a glass of this.

49:29.300 --> 49:31.801
It'll put everything
in its right perspective.

49:31.886 --> 49:33.845
My perspective
is excellent this morning.

49:33.929 --> 49:36.181
I see your leg is much better.

49:36.307 --> 49:39.100
It's a vast improvement.
Very much better.

49:39.185 --> 49:41.353
George and I had a wonderful
family reunion last night

49:41.437 --> 49:43.104
after we carried you home.

49:43.189 --> 49:45.023
- He's quite a lad.
- So I've discovered.

49:45.107 --> 49:46.983
He's thinking ofjoining
the Peace Corps.

49:47.068 --> 49:48.860
Imagine a Litton
in the Peace Corps.

49:48.944 --> 49:50.987
Be careful, or you'll give
your family a good name.

49:51.072 --> 49:53.073
- Please sit down.
- No, thank you.

49:53.199 --> 49:55.408
I was on my way to ski
when I ran into Sir Charles.

49:55.534 --> 49:58.953
- Do you ski, Mr. Litton?
- Ski?

49:59.038 --> 50:01.790
- No, not very well.
- You should learn, George.

50:01.874 --> 50:04.209
If it wasn't for this ropy leg,
I'd take you myself.

50:04.293 --> 50:05.960
I'm hardly in your uncle's class,

50:06.045 --> 50:08.838
but I'd be happy to give you
the benefit of my experience.

50:08.923 --> 50:11.049
I'm sure Madame
is an excellent teacher.

50:11.133 --> 50:13.385
Certainly she could
get you started out right.

50:13.469 --> 50:15.512
If it wouldn't be
too much trouble, yeah.

50:15.596 --> 50:17.597
Not at all.
It would be a pleasure.

50:17.723 --> 50:19.599
Perhaps you'd like
to come along now.

50:20.059 --> 50:22.185
George, you can't pass up
an invitation like that.

50:22.269 --> 50:25.188
I haven't got the proper clothes
and I don't have any skis.

50:25.272 --> 50:28.274
The shop will fix you up.
Just charge everything to me.

50:28.359 --> 50:31.611
Thanks. Your Highness,
hope to see you again.

50:31.696 --> 50:35.699
If you're back early.
I'm leaving on the afternoon train.

50:35.783 --> 50:37.784
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.494
- Thanks, Uncle Charles.
- Have fun.

50:42.456 --> 50:44.999
Mind the instructor.
She knows what she's doing.

50:45.126 --> 50:46.126
I'm sure she does.

50:46.252 --> 50:48.461
- You're not staying?
- No. We're off to the slopes.

50:48.546 --> 50:50.880
I'll get the door.
So long, Uncle Charles.

50:50.965 --> 50:52.590
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

50:54.176 --> 50:57.137
Just in time. Thank you.
You sure you won't join me?

50:57.221 --> 50:58.304
Quite sure.

51:01.434 --> 51:03.518
Do you have to
leave this afternoon?

51:03.602 --> 51:04.853
Yes.

51:04.937 --> 51:07.063
Isn't this departure
rather sudden?

51:07.148 --> 51:09.566
Not at all.
Why do you think so?

51:09.650 --> 51:12.110
I just thought that
after last night...

51:12.194 --> 51:15.238
My leaving has nothing
to do with last night.

51:15.322 --> 51:18.366
- Hasn't it?
- You don't know me very well.

51:18.492 --> 51:20.869
No, but I thought last night
I was making some progress.

51:20.995 --> 51:23.496
That was champagne,
nothing more.

51:23.622 --> 51:26.416
Whatever it was,
it was very interesting.

51:26.500 --> 51:30.003
- I really don't remember.
- That's an awful old cliché.

51:30.129 --> 51:32.213
- It's true.
- The majority of women,

51:32.298 --> 51:35.425
they have half a glass too much
and let down the barriers a little,

51:35.509 --> 51:37.635
and they wake up in the morning
riddled with guilt

51:37.720 --> 51:40.722
and think they can reclaim their virtue
by saying, "I don't remember."

51:40.806 --> 51:42.932
Are you saying my virtue
is not intact?

51:43.017 --> 51:45.310
- You know it is.
- Then why should I feel guilty?

51:45.394 --> 51:47.812
You're not concerned
about what happened.

51:47.897 --> 51:50.106
You're worried about
what might have happened.

51:50.191 --> 51:53.234
That makes you vulnerable.
That makes you a woman.

51:53.319 --> 51:55.320
You're an arrogant fool.

51:56.906 --> 51:59.407
Perhaps I am,
but after what I just said,

51:59.533 --> 52:01.701
a real woman
would have slapped my face.

52:12.713 --> 52:15.298
I'm glad that's over.
Friends again?

52:15.382 --> 52:17.050
Friends.

52:17.176 --> 52:20.678
Good. Now the least you can do
is let me take you to the station.

52:20.763 --> 52:22.806
- All right.
- You really have to go?

52:22.890 --> 52:24.974
- Yes, I must go.
- That's too bad.

52:25.059 --> 52:28.019
- Nothing I can say to make you stay?
- Nothing.

52:28.103 --> 52:30.396
- What time do you have to be there?
- 3:00.

52:30.481 --> 52:34.025
3:00 on the dot,
I'll be here, Your Highness.

52:36.237 --> 52:37.821
3:00.

52:47.414 --> 52:49.916
Do we have to start
the lessons right away?

52:50.042 --> 52:52.168
That's what we're up here for,
is it not?

52:52.253 --> 52:56.005
I was hoping we could talk
about last night.

52:56.090 --> 52:59.759
- We can talk about that later.
- You were more fun in bed.

52:59.844 --> 53:01.845
Would you do me a favor,
Mr. Litton?

53:01.929 --> 53:03.096
Sure, if you call me George.

53:03.180 --> 53:05.974
Forget about last night.
I was impetuous.

53:06.100 --> 53:09.143
I had too much to drink
and I'd just had a fight with my husband.

53:09.228 --> 53:10.645
It might be easier
for you to forget,

53:10.729 --> 53:13.064
but I didn't sleep a wink
after you left.

53:13.148 --> 53:15.358
It was a very frustrating experience.

53:15.442 --> 53:18.444
I'm afraid that's your problem,
but I wouldn't make any plans.

53:18.529 --> 53:19.946
I never make any plans.

53:20.030 --> 53:22.949
I just sort of follow my instincts.

53:23.033 --> 53:26.536
George, it's four miles
down the mountain,

53:26.620 --> 53:27.912
and I'm a very good skier.

53:27.997 --> 53:29.622
You follow your instincts
too closely,

53:29.707 --> 53:32.000
and you're liable
to break your neck.

53:32.084 --> 53:35.545
The first things to learn about skiing
are the fundamentals.

53:35.629 --> 53:37.297
Let's see you turn around.

53:40.217 --> 53:43.970
It's not as easy as it looks.
Let me give you a hand.

53:45.306 --> 53:49.100
Let's try something easier.
It's a lot easier, honest.

53:49.184 --> 53:51.394
You were going
to watch those instincts.

53:51.478 --> 53:52.979
I'm busy. You watch them.

53:53.063 --> 53:54.355
You're abominable.

53:54.440 --> 53:57.150
Yeah, that's me,
the Abominable Snowman.

53:57.234 --> 53:59.068
George, stop it!

54:03.365 --> 54:05.366
Imbecile!

54:21.675 --> 54:23.301
Perhaps we'll meet again.

54:23.385 --> 54:26.137
- Good-bye, Sir Charles.
- Just a minute.

54:27.848 --> 54:30.433
- That's him. There he goes.
- Who?

54:30.517 --> 54:33.019
The man who stole your dog,
in that little car.

55:23.445 --> 55:25.446
- How's it going?
- Fine. I'm going to miss her.

55:25.531 --> 55:28.199
Let that be a lesson.
Never get involved with your victims.

55:28.283 --> 55:31.452
- Shall we get out in the open?
- No. It's a bit hard here.

55:33.872 --> 55:38.334
That's good. That's okay.
Right, start. Give it to me now.

55:46.260 --> 55:48.511
- How close are they?
- Now.

55:48.595 --> 55:50.013
- Sorry. Ready?
- Right.

55:53.434 --> 55:56.686
Come along, little doggy.
Here we are.

56:00.232 --> 56:01.399
Look out!

56:12.578 --> 56:14.996
She's got the dog.
I will see you later.

59:47.167 --> 59:48.709
You have a wonderful smile.

59:48.835 --> 59:51.337
I have a great deal
to smile about.

59:51.463 --> 59:54.340
I have Amber back,
and I'm having a wonderful time.

59:54.466 --> 59:55.508
You missed your train.

59:55.634 --> 59:58.344
There's one at midnight
and one in the morning.

59:58.470 --> 1:00:01.013
Perhaps I should have
your dog kidnapped again.

1:00:01.139 --> 1:00:03.516
Then you'd be bound to stay.

1:00:03.642 --> 1:00:06.227
Did you arrange to have her
kidnapped the first time?

1:00:06.687 --> 1:00:07.853
Of course.

1:00:14.152 --> 1:00:16.362
I am willing
to bet you 10,000 francs

1:00:16.446 --> 1:00:19.824
that the Phantom is in Cortina
at this very moment,

1:00:19.908 --> 1:00:22.076
even perhaps in this very room.

1:00:22.202 --> 1:00:24.453
How exciting.
What do you think, Mr. Tucker?

1:00:24.538 --> 1:00:26.038
I agree with the inspector.

1:00:26.123 --> 1:00:29.458
Ten of his last fifteen victims have been
guests at Angela Dunning's parties.

1:00:29.543 --> 1:00:31.460
What are you all talking about?

1:00:32.254 --> 1:00:35.256
- The notorious Phantom.
- I've never heard of him.

1:00:35.382 --> 1:00:38.718
What little I've read about him,
he seems to be quite a fellow.

1:00:38.802 --> 1:00:42.179
There are few thieves who are
as clever as the Phantom.

1:00:42.264 --> 1:00:45.099
Each theft is completely
different and unique,

1:00:45.225 --> 1:00:47.393
classic in its conception.

1:00:47.519 --> 1:00:50.771
I thought you were working on
the theory that he does repeat himself.

1:00:50.897 --> 1:00:53.858
Only as far as Angela Dunning's
parties are concerned.

1:00:53.942 --> 1:00:56.319
However, there is
one other duplication,

1:00:56.403 --> 1:01:00.990
but that is his trademark,
his calling card, so to speak.

1:01:01.074 --> 1:01:04.201
He always leaves
a white monogrammed glove.

1:01:04.286 --> 1:01:05.995
Sounds terribly theatrical.

1:01:06.079 --> 1:01:09.832
If I were the Phantom,
I'd have chosen my victim already.

1:01:09.916 --> 1:01:12.376
Really? And who would that be?

1:01:13.295 --> 1:01:15.755
Who has the most
fabulous diamond in the world?

1:01:15.881 --> 1:01:18.924
- I suppose I do.
- Exactly. The Pink Panther.

1:01:19.051 --> 1:01:21.177
A prize he could never resist.
He would be bound to try for it.

1:01:21.261 --> 1:01:22.928
He'd be disappointed.

1:01:23.138 --> 1:01:25.306
The Pink Panther
is in my safe at...

1:01:25.432 --> 1:01:28.351
Your Highness, please.
Don't say it, not here.

1:01:28.435 --> 1:01:30.102
If I'm not being too nosy,
Your Highness,

1:01:30.228 --> 1:01:32.355
I read somewhere
there was some dispute

1:01:32.439 --> 1:01:34.106
over the ownership
of the Pink Panther.

1:01:34.232 --> 1:01:36.984
It belongs to me.
It was a gift from my late father.

1:01:37.069 --> 1:01:39.320
- I shall never surrender it.
- Why should you?

1:01:39.404 --> 1:01:41.947
When the present government
seized power,

1:01:42.032 --> 1:01:44.909
they claimed the diamond
was the property of the people.

1:01:44.993 --> 1:01:47.578
There's even talk
of the International Court

1:01:47.662 --> 1:01:48.871
deciding the issue.

1:01:48.955 --> 1:01:52.583
Why don't I steal the diamond
and leave that old glove behind?

1:01:52.667 --> 1:01:53.918
You and I
could split the insurance.

1:01:54.002 --> 1:01:55.753
All right.

1:01:55.879 --> 1:01:57.088
I feel like dancing.

1:01:57.172 --> 1:01:59.507
- Your Highness?
- I'd love to.

1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:04.512
- How about you, Madame?
- Yes, of course.

1:02:05.430 --> 1:02:08.641
- Your leg is better, Sir Charles.
- What?

1:02:08.725 --> 1:02:12.561
- I say, your leg is better.
- Yes, much better. Thank you.

1:02:13.647 --> 1:02:15.272
You know, Mr. Tucker...

1:02:19.277 --> 1:02:21.904
- It's my beer, old man.
- My hand. It burnt...

1:02:21.988 --> 1:02:23.030
I'm sorry.

1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:28.160
Sit down.

1:02:32.416 --> 1:02:34.792
Seems to be working out
better than we expected.

1:02:34.876 --> 1:02:37.002
The only thing we've found out
is that it's not here.

1:02:37.129 --> 1:02:40.381
You shouldn't have any trouble
discovering exactly where it is.

1:02:40.465 --> 1:02:43.884
Her Highness seems
to be completely captivated.

1:02:43.969 --> 1:02:46.470
I'd say that's
a considerable exaggeration.

1:02:46.555 --> 1:02:48.639
You're either showing
a touch of senility,

1:02:48.723 --> 1:02:50.266
or you need glasses, my love.

1:02:50.350 --> 1:02:52.351
When I'm showing
my senility, darling,

1:02:52.436 --> 1:02:54.770
you'll be occupying your time
with your grandchildren.

1:02:54.855 --> 1:02:57.773
One has to have children
before one has grandchildren.

1:02:57.858 --> 1:02:59.108
You wouldn't dare.

1:02:59.192 --> 1:03:01.318
Jacques would make
a wonderful father.

1:03:01.403 --> 1:03:04.196
- He has many redeeming qualities.
- Name one.

1:03:04.281 --> 1:03:07.324
He's kind, loyal,
faithful, obedient.

1:03:07.409 --> 1:03:09.869
You're either married
to a Boy Scout or a dachshund.

1:03:09.953 --> 1:03:11.078
And he adores me.

1:03:11.746 --> 1:03:14.206
That eliminates the Boy Scouts.

1:03:15.292 --> 1:03:17.334
- Good night.
- Thank you.

1:03:25.469 --> 1:03:27.136
You seem to have
lost something.

1:03:27.846 --> 1:03:30.931
- How'd you like to borrow mine?
- Thanks, Uncle Charles, yes.

1:03:31.057 --> 1:03:32.224
Madame.

1:03:40.025 --> 1:03:43.027
- You've been avoiding me.
- That about describes it.

1:03:43.111 --> 1:03:44.570
You know what
I've been thinking?

1:03:44.654 --> 1:03:47.239
Yes. That's why
I've been avoiding you.

1:03:47.324 --> 1:03:49.867
I don't think you were really
looking for me that night

1:03:49.951 --> 1:03:51.410
in my uncle's bedroom.

1:03:51.495 --> 1:03:53.537
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No, I mean it.

1:03:53.622 --> 1:03:55.539
Not the way
you treated me today.

1:03:55.624 --> 1:03:57.750
- You know what I think?
- What?

1:04:00.962 --> 1:04:03.255
What do you think, George?

1:04:03.340 --> 1:04:06.091
I think maybe I was wrong.

1:04:10.764 --> 1:04:12.139
I'm sorry I have to leave,

1:04:12.224 --> 1:04:15.142
but I must make
a very important phone call.

1:04:15.227 --> 1:04:18.229
- Can't it wait?
- I'm afraid not.

1:04:18.313 --> 1:04:19.438
Good night.

1:04:33.286 --> 1:04:34.411
That's better.

1:04:39.834 --> 1:04:42.670
Just a quick shower, my love,
and I will be right with you.

1:05:07.028 --> 1:05:08.195
One moment, please.

1:05:15.579 --> 1:05:16.870
Inspector Clouseau.

1:05:16.955 --> 1:05:20.082
Inspector Clouseau,
this is the prefect of police.

1:05:20.166 --> 1:05:22.293
I have information
regarding the Phantom.

1:05:22.377 --> 1:05:24.169
- The Phantom?
- Yes. You must come at once.

1:05:24.254 --> 1:05:25.296
I'm in Brunico.

1:05:25.422 --> 1:05:29.174
Brunico? But that's in Brunico.
That's 30 miles from here.

1:05:29.301 --> 1:05:31.594
It is here that I have
discovered the information.

1:05:31.678 --> 1:05:32.928
Come immediately.

1:05:33.013 --> 1:05:35.097
I cannot say more.
I am being watched.

1:05:36.349 --> 1:05:38.684
Yes. I understand, yes.

1:05:41.062 --> 1:05:44.148
I'm sorry, my darling.
Important police business.

1:05:44.232 --> 1:05:46.609
I will be back with you
as soon as possible.

1:05:46.693 --> 1:05:48.527
I understand, my love.

1:05:49.487 --> 1:05:51.196
- My darling.
- Yes?

1:05:51.740 --> 1:05:55.868
I am a husband that must be
envied by all other husbands.

1:05:55.952 --> 1:05:58.787
I'm sure no one
ever had a husband like you.

1:05:58.872 --> 1:05:59.913
My darling.

1:06:04.044 --> 1:06:06.378
My darling, don't move.
Don't panic.

1:06:06.463 --> 1:06:08.714
All that has happened
is that my hat has caught

1:06:08.798 --> 1:06:12.301
in one of your naughty
little hairpins.

1:06:12.385 --> 1:06:13.636
Voilà.

1:06:19.726 --> 1:06:25.689
You know, at times like this
I wish I was but a simple peasant.

1:06:25.774 --> 1:06:30.235
It's times like this that make me
realize how lucky I really am.

1:07:01.184 --> 1:07:04.436
He's gone to Brunico.
Another call about the Phantom.

1:07:06.356 --> 1:07:08.774
There's something going on.

1:07:08.858 --> 1:07:12.027
I don't quite know what it is,
but there's something wrong.

1:07:12.112 --> 1:07:13.570
Do you want to call it off?

1:07:13.655 --> 1:07:15.489
I don't know.
I'm considering it.

1:07:15.615 --> 1:07:16.865
Have you considered
something else?

1:07:16.950 --> 1:07:18.158
What's that?

1:07:18.284 --> 1:07:20.661
The possibility that
you're growing a conscience.

1:07:20.787 --> 1:07:23.497
- A conscience? About what?
- The princess.

1:07:24.457 --> 1:07:27.710
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, I'm just being a woman.

1:07:27.794 --> 1:07:31.422
This time you've chosen
a fascinating victim.

1:07:31.506 --> 1:07:33.549
I suspect you've broken
the first rule

1:07:33.633 --> 1:07:34.925
and allowed yourself
to become involved.

1:07:35.009 --> 1:07:37.386
You're being a woman, all right.

1:07:37.470 --> 1:07:40.973
That's obvious. Competition
always makes a woman obvious.

1:07:42.851 --> 1:07:44.768
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

1:07:48.022 --> 1:07:49.064
Wait a minute.

1:07:52.318 --> 1:07:54.403
- What is it?
- Flowers.

1:08:05.248 --> 1:08:07.166
- George!
- Trick or treat.

1:08:07.250 --> 1:08:10.711
- Wait a minute.
- I found these growing in the hall.

1:08:13.631 --> 1:08:15.048
You get right out of here.

1:08:15.133 --> 1:08:17.676
What kind of hospitality is that?

1:08:17.761 --> 1:08:19.803
But my husband
could be back any minute.

1:08:19.888 --> 1:08:22.389
He must be about
halfway to Brunico by now.

1:08:22.515 --> 1:08:24.850
"You must come to Brunico
immediately, Inspector.

1:08:24.976 --> 1:08:27.603
I have information
regarding the Phantom."

1:08:27.687 --> 1:08:31.356
While you're in Brunico,
waiting for the prefect of police...

1:08:31.441 --> 1:08:32.858
Thank you very much.

1:08:32.984 --> 1:08:35.444
...I shall be investigating your wife.

1:08:38.656 --> 1:08:41.158
One never knows, huh?

1:08:41.242 --> 1:08:43.744
Perhaps the Phantom
is hiding under the bed.

1:08:45.246 --> 1:08:46.538
That's more like it.

1:08:46.623 --> 1:08:48.916
- You should be ashamed.
- I'm planning on it.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:50.542
Suppose Jacques
doesn't go to Brunico?

1:08:50.627 --> 1:08:52.753
Suppose he finds out
the prefect never called?

1:08:52.837 --> 1:08:54.254
You must get out of here.

1:08:54.339 --> 1:08:56.965
You are the damnedest woman.
Are you a sexual yo-yo?

1:08:57.050 --> 1:08:59.259
You jump in my bed,
you push me off a mountain,

1:08:59.344 --> 1:09:01.178
then you practically seduce me
on the dance floor.

1:09:01.262 --> 1:09:04.765
You're terribly attractive,
and I'm naturally...

1:09:04.849 --> 1:09:06.850
- But not here.
- Where?

1:09:06.935 --> 1:09:08.727
I don't know, but not tonight.

1:09:08.812 --> 1:09:11.355
You know what your trouble is?
You can't make up your mind.

1:09:11.439 --> 1:09:13.524
- I am married.
- Where's your husband?

1:09:13.608 --> 1:09:15.609
Out in 12 feet of snow,
chasing the Phantom.

1:09:15.735 --> 1:09:17.277
- That was your idea.
- Sure it was.

1:09:17.403 --> 1:09:20.197
If he was any kind of a man,
he wouldn't have gone.

1:09:20.740 --> 1:09:22.741
- Darling.
- "Darling"?

1:09:25.578 --> 1:09:26.954
It's locked.

1:09:32.919 --> 1:09:36.755
There you are.
Halfway to Brunico, huh?

1:09:36.881 --> 1:09:38.090
Angel?

1:09:43.429 --> 1:09:46.098
- What do I do?
- Answer the door.

1:09:47.100 --> 1:09:49.017
- Simone?
- Yes, dear?

1:09:51.437 --> 1:09:55.190
- But I thought you were on...
- That phone call was a ruse.

1:09:57.235 --> 1:09:58.902
Are you hurt, my darling?

1:10:01.406 --> 1:10:03.365
I don't recall that being there.

1:10:03.449 --> 1:10:06.535
No, it was sent a while ago.
I thought it was from you.

1:10:06.619 --> 1:10:08.579
No, it certainly was not from me.

1:10:10.456 --> 1:10:12.541
Some very strange things
going on here.

1:10:14.586 --> 1:10:16.670
I passed the prefect on the road.

1:10:18.548 --> 1:10:20.757
- He never made that call.
- No?

1:10:23.386 --> 1:10:25.470
There was no card with these?

1:10:29.058 --> 1:10:31.685
Why should anybody want me
to go to Brunico?

1:10:33.021 --> 1:10:34.813
My darling.

1:10:34.939 --> 1:10:37.649
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to kiss your foot.

1:10:37.734 --> 1:10:39.902
- Let me kiss your face.
- It's all right.

1:10:39.986 --> 1:10:42.237
Darling, I'm sorry.
Come here.

1:10:42.322 --> 1:10:45.616
That's nice and comfy.
You belong in bed there.

1:10:46.868 --> 1:10:49.161
- My darling.
- Listen, dear.

1:10:49.245 --> 1:10:51.580
Why don't we go down to the bar
and have a nightcap?

1:10:51.706 --> 1:10:56.460
Darling, listen,
why don't I have a nice bath?

1:10:56.544 --> 1:10:59.671
And afterwards,
we have our lovely warm bed.

1:10:59.797 --> 1:11:02.424
Don't worry about this mess.
We can have it cleaned up later.

1:11:02.508 --> 1:11:04.468
We don't want
any more interruptions.

1:11:04.552 --> 1:11:06.511
Would you mind if I bathed first?

1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:10.265
Did you not bathe earlier?

1:11:10.350 --> 1:11:14.811
Yes, but it would warm me up,
help me to relax.

1:11:16.648 --> 1:11:18.440
I'll tell you what we'll do.

1:11:18.524 --> 1:11:20.651
Like we did in the old days,
when you're in there,

1:11:20.735 --> 1:11:22.736
I will come in
and scrub your back for you.

1:11:22.862 --> 1:11:25.572
You're so romantic,
but I'll only be a moment.

1:12:42.942 --> 1:12:44.985
- Darling?
- Yes?

1:12:47.530 --> 1:12:51.283
- Hello, my darling.
- Hello, my darling.

1:12:51.367 --> 1:12:54.953
- Why did you draw the curtains?
- Just to keep me warm.

1:12:55.038 --> 1:12:58.498
Warm? Warm is one thing.
It must be hell in there.

1:12:58.624 --> 1:13:00.834
No, it's wonderful.

1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:03.003
Why don't you let me
wash your back for you?

1:13:03.129 --> 1:13:04.796
It's already done, my darling.

1:13:04.922 --> 1:13:07.799
As I told you before,
I just want to relax.

1:13:07.884 --> 1:13:10.135
We must have no secrets
from one another, my darling.

1:13:10.219 --> 1:13:11.303
I know, my darling.

1:13:15.850 --> 1:13:17.934
I will brush my teeth
and keep you company.

1:13:18.019 --> 1:13:20.145
That's sweet of you, my darling.

1:13:37.163 --> 1:13:41.291
I thought you would like to know
Princess Dala just checked out.

1:13:41.375 --> 1:13:42.667
Thank you very much.

1:13:45.838 --> 1:13:49.174
Darling, you got rid of all
those naughty little bubbles?

1:13:49.258 --> 1:13:51.885
- I beg your pardon?
- You got rid of the little bubbles?

1:13:51.969 --> 1:13:53.053
Yes, I did.

1:13:57.850 --> 1:13:59.684
Hey, come...

1:14:00.645 --> 1:14:02.187
Come out quick.

1:14:10.446 --> 1:14:12.781
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

1:14:12.865 --> 1:14:14.032
One minute.

1:14:17.411 --> 1:14:19.704
- Inspector's violin, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1:14:19.831 --> 1:14:23.125
- Madame, the flowers.
- It's nothing. It doesn't matter.

1:14:23.209 --> 1:14:25.418
If they found out downstairs,
I'd lose my job.

1:14:25.545 --> 1:14:28.130
- Do it in the morning.
- I'll ring for the maid.

1:14:39.767 --> 1:14:41.351
- Darling?
- Yes, dear?

1:14:41.435 --> 1:14:42.978
How would you like to
wash my back?

1:14:43.062 --> 1:14:45.105
I'd love to, but you see...

1:14:45.231 --> 1:14:48.358
I have to... I mean...
I'm cold.

1:14:54.615 --> 1:14:55.991
Get the broom.

1:15:01.622 --> 1:15:04.583
Come on. Hurry up. Go.

1:15:18.347 --> 1:15:21.183
Shan't be a moment, my darling.
I'll just put on my pajamas.

1:15:21.267 --> 1:15:24.644
Darling, look. I think I've got
something in my right eye.

1:15:24.729 --> 1:15:27.105
- Let me put you in the...
- My left one. No, this one.

1:15:27.190 --> 1:15:30.108
- If you'd come in the light...
- It hurts!

1:15:30.193 --> 1:15:33.987
- Stand still. I can't see it.
- It hurts. I cannot open it.

1:15:34.113 --> 1:15:35.697
Stand in the light a moment.

1:15:35.781 --> 1:15:37.866
- Where?
- Here.

1:15:37.950 --> 1:15:40.160
There's absolutely nothing
in your eye.

1:15:40.286 --> 1:15:41.745
Nothing? Are you sure?

1:15:41.829 --> 1:15:44.122
Only your eye.
That is all that is there.

1:15:55.134 --> 1:15:57.677
- What are you doing?
- It broke off.

1:15:57.762 --> 1:16:00.472
Put it back. We have no time.
He's coming back.

1:16:00.556 --> 1:16:02.515
Get under the bed.
Come on. Quick.

1:16:03.976 --> 1:16:05.018
Come on.

1:16:08.022 --> 1:16:09.564
Why aren't you in bed,
my darling?

1:16:09.649 --> 1:16:13.610
I was... I mean...

1:16:13.694 --> 1:16:16.112
I mean, I'm just going to.

1:16:18.699 --> 1:16:19.783
I'm cold.

1:16:20.660 --> 1:16:24.788
- My Stradivarius.
- The porter just brought it in.

1:16:24.872 --> 1:16:28.750
I sent it to the village
to be repaired.

1:16:28.834 --> 1:16:30.835
I hope they know how
to fix plastic.

1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:32.003
I hope so, too.

1:16:33.965 --> 1:16:35.090
So far, so good.

1:16:36.550 --> 1:16:37.592
We shall see.

1:16:42.807 --> 1:16:43.974
Better than ever.

1:16:45.518 --> 1:16:48.228
Dear, I doubt if we shall
need it tonight, my love.

1:16:48.354 --> 1:16:50.689
I'm sure we won't, darling.

1:17:08.708 --> 1:17:09.708
What is it?

1:17:11.419 --> 1:17:12.877
It's very strange.

1:17:26.142 --> 1:17:27.642
Why don't you come to bed?

1:17:29.312 --> 1:17:31.521
You know,
I don't understand this.

1:17:32.857 --> 1:17:34.232
You see...

1:17:35.526 --> 1:17:38.361
These footprints...

1:17:39.572 --> 1:17:43.575
They were made by shoes...

1:17:44.702 --> 1:17:49.122
...and they were not
made by my feet.

1:17:55.421 --> 1:17:58.256
I'll just get up
and turn off the lights.

1:18:02.261 --> 1:18:04.346
At last. At last.

1:18:05.264 --> 1:18:07.307
Darling, my little...

1:18:10.269 --> 1:18:12.937
Darling? What's the matter,
my darling?

1:18:13.064 --> 1:18:17.192
It's very strange, my love,
but suddenly I'm freezing cold.

1:18:17.276 --> 1:18:20.862
- You're freezing cold?
- The window is open.

1:18:20.946 --> 1:18:22.113
The window's open.

1:18:22.239 --> 1:18:25.450
Sometimes it's healthy
to have fresh air.

1:18:25.534 --> 1:18:29.454
Healthy is one thing,
but it's hell in here, my love.

1:18:29.580 --> 1:18:32.123
Ten below zero outside,
my darling.

1:18:36.754 --> 1:18:38.171
That's better.

1:18:45.304 --> 1:18:47.305
- There, my darling.
- Yes.

1:18:51.644 --> 1:18:53.228
At last!

1:19:17.128 --> 1:19:19.170
- Yes?
- I just arrived in town.

1:19:19.255 --> 1:19:20.755
No trouble with the police yet.

1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:24.592
The princess is expecting
important visitors here tomorrow.

1:19:24.677 --> 1:19:27.512
- She say anything about leaving?
- Who is this?

1:19:40.568 --> 1:19:43.111
- Yes?
<i>- Princess Dala, please.</i>

1:19:43.195 --> 1:19:45.780
<i>Her Highness checked out</i>
<i>a short while ago.</i>

1:20:59.772 --> 1:21:01.731
Uncle Charles.

1:21:38.352 --> 1:21:40.144
What did you say?

1:21:40.229 --> 1:21:42.313
I said he could come
as one of the Borgias.

1:21:42.398 --> 1:21:44.065
Then he wouldn't
have to explain his cousin.

1:21:44.149 --> 1:21:45.149
What's a Borgia?

1:21:49.280 --> 1:21:50.363
Good evening.

1:21:59.665 --> 1:22:01.583
I mean...

1:22:01.667 --> 1:22:05.336
I enjoy champagne in bed
as much as the next man,

1:22:06.672 --> 1:22:09.591
but from now on, perhaps
a more practical approach?

1:22:09.717 --> 1:22:13.386
I'm sorry, my darling.
I wanted to surprise you.

1:22:13.679 --> 1:22:17.432
- It's been a night of surprises.
- You can say that again.

1:22:17.516 --> 1:22:18.933
It's been...

1:22:21.061 --> 1:22:23.021
Anyway...

1:22:23.272 --> 1:22:25.356
- My love?
- Yes?

1:22:27.943 --> 1:22:29.986
Shall I say you're not here?

1:22:31.030 --> 1:22:33.323
No, it's all right, darling.
I'll answer it.

1:22:42.291 --> 1:22:45.251
- Yes!
- Tucker here, Inspector.

1:22:45.544 --> 1:22:48.963
The man who kidnapped
the dog was driving a rented car.

1:22:49.173 --> 1:22:51.633
He's been identified
as a man named Artoff.

1:22:51.717 --> 1:22:54.093
London informs us
that a man of his description

1:22:54.803 --> 1:22:57.597
is at present employed
by Sir Charles Litton.

1:22:57.973 --> 1:23:00.016
I see. Come up immediately.

1:23:00.100 --> 1:23:01.225
Sir Charles!

1:23:01.352 --> 1:23:04.562
He's the Phantom!
I've really got him this time.

1:23:18.786 --> 1:23:21.454
Sir Charles?
Open that door.

1:23:21.830 --> 1:23:23.331
I know you're in there.

1:23:23.916 --> 1:23:25.917
Open up. This is the police.

1:23:26.585 --> 1:23:29.587
- Stand back while I fire.
- No, don't do that, old man.

1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:45.687
- Jacques knows.
- And somebody else.

1:23:46.063 --> 1:23:48.314
George has got
my do-it-yourself Phantom kit.

1:23:48.816 --> 1:23:50.483
I've got to get out of here.

1:23:52.069 --> 1:23:55.321
- His clothes are still here.
- Perhaps he's already escaped.

1:23:55.614 --> 1:23:58.032
Most unlikely. He doesn't realize
that I am onto him.

1:23:58.117 --> 1:23:59.450
Listen, old man.

1:23:59.743 --> 1:24:03.371
We've no proof that Artoff was
the man driving the Innocente.

1:24:03.455 --> 1:24:06.708
Sir Charles is our man.
My every instinct tells me so.

1:24:06.917 --> 1:24:08.459
Careful, you fool.
You realize this gun is loaded?

1:24:08.794 --> 1:24:12.296
What I must do now is get dressed
and search the rest of the hotel.

1:24:19.805 --> 1:24:21.806
- Did you find him?
- No, but he can't be far.

1:24:22.099 --> 1:24:24.183
I must dress quickly and get...

1:24:28.188 --> 1:24:29.897
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

1:24:30.274 --> 1:24:31.399
My coat!

1:24:31.650 --> 1:24:34.152
My Sûreté Scotland-Yard-type
Macintosh! It's gone!

1:24:34.236 --> 1:24:36.279
Good evening, Inspector.

1:25:14.443 --> 1:25:17.528
- What is it, Saloud?
- Inspector Clouseau.

1:25:20.824 --> 1:25:23.117
Your Highness,
please excuse this interruption.

1:25:23.202 --> 1:25:24.952
I have news
of great importance.

1:25:25.037 --> 1:25:27.371
This is Mr. Tucker
of Lloyd's of London.

1:25:27.623 --> 1:25:29.707
And we have met before.

1:25:30.793 --> 1:25:32.502
I've met her, too, you know.

1:25:32.586 --> 1:25:34.337
Yes, I know, but we are
meeting her again now.

1:25:34.421 --> 1:25:36.422
What is this news?

1:25:36.590 --> 1:25:39.759
I have discovered
the identity of the Phantom.

1:25:39.968 --> 1:25:41.969
- You don't say.
- I do say.

1:25:42.221 --> 1:25:43.930
- Of course, we're not positive.
- I am positive.

1:25:44.056 --> 1:25:45.932
He is, I believe, at this
very moment here in Rome.

1:25:46.058 --> 1:25:48.100
- Really?
- Yes.

1:25:48.185 --> 1:25:50.561
Have you seen or heard
from Sir Charles Litton?

1:25:50.646 --> 1:25:53.481
Not since I left Cortina. Why?

1:25:53.565 --> 1:25:56.275
Sir Charles and the Phantom
are one and the same.

1:25:56.401 --> 1:25:58.903
- You're not serious.
- I am serious.

1:25:59.112 --> 1:26:00.404
I can understand
how difficult it is

1:26:00.489 --> 1:26:03.241
for Your Highness
to accept the facts.

1:26:03.367 --> 1:26:06.536
Sir Charles is a very persuasive
and attractive man.

1:26:06.703 --> 1:26:08.371
He is also Sir Charles Litton,

1:26:08.705 --> 1:26:11.290
a man of considerable influence
and reputation.

1:26:11.583 --> 1:26:12.917
She's got quite a point there.

1:26:13.043 --> 1:26:15.753
He is a fraud,
and I shall prove it.

1:26:16.004 --> 1:26:17.922
Meanwhile,
I would like your permission

1:26:18.131 --> 1:26:19.549
to surround the house
with armed guards.

1:26:19.633 --> 1:26:22.343
- I take it the gem is in the villa.
- It is.

1:26:22.594 --> 1:26:25.555
As you know, I'm having
a rather large party this evening.

1:26:25.889 --> 1:26:28.975
Your guests will be caused
no embarrassment whatsoever.

1:26:29.059 --> 1:26:32.770
They will not be aware my men
are present in their disguises.

1:26:33.021 --> 1:26:34.605
In that case,
you have my permission.

1:26:34.815 --> 1:26:35.940
Thank you.

1:26:48.287 --> 1:26:50.788
Your Highness, mark my words,

1:26:51.081 --> 1:26:53.207
if Sir Charles is foolish enough

1:26:53.333 --> 1:26:55.877
to attempt to steal
your diamond tonight,

1:26:55.961 --> 1:26:59.630
you will be witness to the capture
of the notorious Phantom.

1:27:01.717 --> 1:27:02.884
Gentlemen.

1:27:20.444 --> 1:27:21.819
The plans will
have to be changed.

1:27:21.904 --> 1:27:23.571
No.

1:27:24.114 --> 1:27:28.618
We just have to make sure
Sir Charles doesn't steal the jewel.

1:28:19.086 --> 1:28:21.087
- Hello.
- Hello, Tucker.

1:28:21.171 --> 1:28:22.588
- Like a drink?
- No, thank you.

1:28:22.673 --> 1:28:25.758
I never drink whilst on duty.
You should know that. Never.

1:28:25.884 --> 1:28:27.802
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

1:28:28.053 --> 1:28:30.930
- Warm.
- Yes, it must be hell in there.

1:28:32.182 --> 1:28:33.724
Bet it's not so good in there.

1:28:34.977 --> 1:28:38.229
- Anything suspicious?
- No, nothing to worry about.

1:28:39.481 --> 1:28:42.066
My men are everywhere,
mingling here, mingling there.

1:28:42.234 --> 1:28:44.110
Watching all the time, watching.

1:28:50.158 --> 1:28:52.243
How dare you drink
whilst you're on duty?

1:28:52.369 --> 1:28:53.369
Who is inside there?

1:28:53.453 --> 1:28:55.454
- Sergeant Walter!
- Sergeant Quinn.

1:28:55.664 --> 1:28:57.790
Any more behavior like this,
and I'll have your stripes.

1:28:58.000 --> 1:28:59.792
Now get out of here
and start mingling again.

1:29:04.423 --> 1:29:06.507
Quite funny that,
the zebra and the stripes.

1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:10.678
- Yes, very good, very good.
- Not bad, not bad.

1:29:10.971 --> 1:29:12.596
I think I'll mingle.

1:29:14.057 --> 1:29:15.099
Right.

1:29:31.825 --> 1:29:35.369
Didn't I tell you I'd make this
the biggest social success of the year?

1:29:35.454 --> 1:29:36.954
Certainly you did.

1:29:37.080 --> 1:29:40.458
The only thing that worries me is,
what do we do for your next one?

1:29:40.625 --> 1:29:44.336
- How can I possibly top this?
- You'll think of something.

1:29:44.504 --> 1:29:47.298
- Excuse me.
- Of course, love. Have a ball!

1:29:47.382 --> 1:29:48.799
Hello, you!

1:29:52.679 --> 1:29:54.472
May I see
your invitation, please?

1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:56.682
All right.

1:30:04.066 --> 1:30:06.484
Wasn't there another gorilla
in a Rolls-Royce?

1:30:06.610 --> 1:30:08.611
Yes, probably a rich uncle.

1:30:10.572 --> 1:30:12.990
You see, gentlemen?
Perfectly safe.

1:30:13.116 --> 1:30:14.658
One cannot be too careful.

1:30:14.826 --> 1:30:17.203
This party...
all your guests wearing masks.

1:30:17.579 --> 1:30:20.706
It was possible the Phantom
had already done his work.

1:30:20.999 --> 1:30:22.124
Without an invitation,

1:30:22.209 --> 1:30:24.502
how could Sir Charles
get past your guards?

1:30:24.836 --> 1:30:27.713
Where the Phantom
is concerned, Your Highness...

1:30:29.382 --> 1:30:30.508
What's wrong?

1:30:42.687 --> 1:30:43.813
What are you doing?

1:30:43.897 --> 1:30:45.481
The question is,
what are you doing?

1:30:45.565 --> 1:30:48.692
- I protest!
- Remove your head at once!

1:30:48.819 --> 1:30:50.361
Tucker, remove his head.

1:30:55.242 --> 1:30:58.619
- It's our ambassador.
- Ambassador?

1:30:58.703 --> 1:31:00.246
My apologies, Lord Cravenwood.

1:31:00.330 --> 1:31:02.706
The inspector was only acting
with the best of motives.

1:31:02.874 --> 1:31:04.041
Your Highness.

1:31:11.550 --> 1:31:14.301
Lord Cravenwood,
what would your wife think?

1:31:19.891 --> 1:31:22.143
- What's he got that I haven't got?
- George!

1:31:22.227 --> 1:31:24.311
- In the flesh.
- What are you doing here?

1:31:24.396 --> 1:31:27.731
- Tarzan let me use the car.
- I've got to talk to you.

1:31:27.816 --> 1:31:29.608
You've got to get out of here.

1:31:31.486 --> 1:31:32.611
Darling...

1:31:32.737 --> 1:31:34.989
Lord Cravenwood, I'm terribly
sorry about what happened.

1:31:35.073 --> 1:31:37.241
I was discussing important things
with Her Highness.

1:31:37.367 --> 1:31:39.034
When I discovered you
outside the library door,

1:31:39.119 --> 1:31:40.911
I thought...

1:31:45.083 --> 1:31:47.209
- The ambassador.
- Yes, I know.

1:31:47.460 --> 1:31:50.004
Darling, you haven't danced
with me all evening, my angel.

1:31:50.130 --> 1:31:53.465
- I'm sorry, my darling.
- That's all for now.

1:31:59.014 --> 1:32:01.682
Pardon me! I'm lost.

1:32:01.766 --> 1:32:04.560
I must have gotten off
the main road.

1:32:04.644 --> 1:32:06.478
I'm on my way to Frascati.

1:32:06.605 --> 1:32:10.524
Go down the road a half mile.
You'll see a sign.

1:32:10.609 --> 1:32:13.777
Turn right. It'll take you
right to the highway.

1:32:33.006 --> 1:32:35.299
Excuse me, but I've got to
talk to Lord Cravenwood.

1:32:35.467 --> 1:32:36.508
It's extremely important.

1:32:36.635 --> 1:32:38.636
That's okay.
He's making me itch, anyway.

1:32:38.762 --> 1:32:39.803
Fine.

1:32:41.139 --> 1:32:44.058
Listen to me. I know what
you're up to, and it won't work.

1:32:44.184 --> 1:32:47.394
- You'll ruin everything.
- Excuse me, Your Excellency.

1:32:47.479 --> 1:32:50.356
May I cut in?
Thank you so much, sir.

1:32:50.607 --> 1:32:51.774
Are you having a good time?

1:32:52.025 --> 1:32:53.984
- Yes, extremely good time.
- Good.

1:33:55.463 --> 1:33:57.631
Fine party, Angela darling.

1:33:57.841 --> 1:34:01.010
Wait till you see
the fireworks at midnight.

1:34:31.750 --> 1:34:34.752
Hello, old boy.
May I have this dance?

1:34:36.254 --> 1:34:39.465
I never learned to dance.
I've simply got natural rhythm.

1:34:39.549 --> 1:34:41.133
You're quite right.

1:34:45.138 --> 1:34:48.891
By Jove, that looked...
It is! It's Sir Charles!

1:34:55.690 --> 1:34:56.815
Tucker!

1:34:59.110 --> 1:35:01.111
- Inspector!
- Tucker!

1:35:06.284 --> 1:35:07.785
Inspector!

1:35:10.121 --> 1:35:12.289
Take your filthy hands
off my asp.

1:35:17.420 --> 1:35:19.296
- Charles?
- Where's the safe?

1:35:19.381 --> 1:35:20.964
In the library.
George is robbing it.

1:35:21.132 --> 1:35:22.216
- Which way?
- Come on.

1:35:23.343 --> 1:35:26.136
- But it's not midnight yet.
- They turned the lights out.

1:35:26.221 --> 1:35:27.930
Her Highness must have
changed her mind.

1:35:28.014 --> 1:35:29.056
All right.

1:35:30.266 --> 1:35:31.934
Be careful.
I can't see a thing.

1:35:32.018 --> 1:35:34.645
Tucker? Where are you?

1:35:36.272 --> 1:35:38.148
Watch where you're going!

1:35:53.289 --> 1:35:54.498
It's hell in here.

1:36:01.589 --> 1:36:02.631
A candle!

1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:07.344
- Hey, got a match?
- Yes, sir.

1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:08.804
Quick, quick.

1:36:29.242 --> 1:36:31.160
What kind of a candle is this?

1:36:37.375 --> 1:36:39.376
In there.
George is in the gorilla suit.

1:36:39.461 --> 1:36:41.211
- Gorilla?
- Good luck.

1:36:44.549 --> 1:36:46.633
Rule, Britannia

1:36:46.718 --> 1:36:48.969
Britannia, rule the waves

1:36:49.053 --> 1:36:53.223
Britons never, never, never
shall be slaves

1:36:53.349 --> 1:36:55.684
Rule, Britannia

1:36:55.768 --> 1:36:58.395
Britannia, rule the waves...
I say!

1:37:11.993 --> 1:37:13.619
Inspector! Inspector!

1:37:13.703 --> 1:37:15.704
Inspector, Sir Charles is here.

1:40:05.500 --> 1:40:07.334
- George?
- Uncle Charles?

1:40:07.418 --> 1:40:09.419
- Have you got it?
- No. Haven't you?

1:40:09.504 --> 1:40:11.755
No. The safe's empty.

1:40:13.925 --> 1:40:15.008
What's that?

1:40:21.015 --> 1:40:23.016
Someone's been
highly dishonest.

1:40:23.101 --> 1:40:24.601
Follow me, men.

1:40:27.939 --> 1:40:29.981
You idiots!
They're getting away from us!

1:40:30.108 --> 1:40:32.526
Help me to my feet, someone.
Mr. Tucker!

1:40:34.153 --> 1:40:36.029
After them! Come on, Tucker!

1:41:02.849 --> 1:41:04.641
Come back! It's me!

1:42:01.324 --> 1:42:03.992
Come on now!
Faster! Faster!

1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:09.956
What's the matter with you?
Can't you drive this thing faster?

1:42:20.718 --> 1:42:23.553
Tucker, you're wrong.
Come on! Quick!

1:42:23.679 --> 1:42:25.972
I tell you, this is the road
they've gone up.

1:42:27.391 --> 1:42:30.644
Don't argue with me!
I know where they've gone.

1:42:42.740 --> 1:42:44.574
George, any idea
how we get out of here?

1:42:44.700 --> 1:42:46.326
I don't know.
I've been all over.

1:42:46.410 --> 1:42:48.245
I've been up this street,
that one.

1:42:48.329 --> 1:42:51.832
- How we gonna get out of here?
- Why don't you try the high road?

1:42:51.916 --> 1:42:54.167
I'll take the high road.
You take the low road.

1:42:54.252 --> 1:42:56.336
- So long, Uncle Charles.
- Ciao, George.

1:43:29.287 --> 1:43:30.912
Who taught you
to drive this thing?

1:43:43.885 --> 1:43:46.928
- I see them! That's them!
- No, it isn't!

1:44:19.837 --> 1:44:22.255
Then when I was
thrown out of college,

1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:23.757
I made up my mind.

1:44:25.426 --> 1:44:27.761
I decided to live a little.

1:44:28.638 --> 1:44:31.139
I knew if I continued
my academic endeavors,

1:44:31.223 --> 1:44:33.808
I could depend upon
that check of yours every month.

1:44:33.893 --> 1:44:35.560
You know what I did?

1:44:35.645 --> 1:44:37.687
I took a plush
Hollywood apartment,

1:44:37.772 --> 1:44:42.192
surrounded myself with all of
the advantages of a wealthy bachelor,

1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:45.779
then I sent you glowing reports
of a brilliant academic career.

1:44:45.988 --> 1:44:48.281
I suppose a certain
amount of dishonesty

1:44:48.366 --> 1:44:50.700
is bound to beget
a certain amount of dishonesty.

1:44:56.666 --> 1:44:57.916
But, Inspector...

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.085
Come on, please.
I have not much time.

1:45:21.774 --> 1:45:23.608
Better be right this time.

1:45:27.947 --> 1:45:30.699
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Inspector.

1:45:30.783 --> 1:45:32.367
Guillotine all sharp and shiny?

1:45:33.411 --> 1:45:35.954
The trial is all set
for tomorrow morning.

1:45:36.038 --> 1:45:38.873
- Shouldn't take too long.
- That sounds encouraging.

1:45:38.958 --> 1:45:43.712
Yes, it's encouraging for me,
but bad for you.

1:45:43.796 --> 1:45:45.255
Have some coffee, Inspector.

1:45:45.339 --> 1:45:47.090
You could save yourself
a lot of trouble

1:45:47.174 --> 1:45:49.092
if you would tell me
where the jewel is.

1:45:49.176 --> 1:45:52.345
Tuck into some of that porridge.
Guaranteed good for sleuthing.

1:45:52.430 --> 1:45:55.306
- You refuse to cooperate?
- We've offered porridge and coffee.

1:45:55.391 --> 1:45:56.599
It's all that's left.

1:45:56.684 --> 1:45:58.601
I'm glad you're enjoying yourselves

1:45:58.769 --> 1:46:03.773
because you're going to be here
for the next 20 years...

1:46:15.619 --> 1:46:17.245
Madame Clouseau.

1:46:21.625 --> 1:46:24.294
- Your Highness.
- Madame.

1:46:24.420 --> 1:46:25.628
Won't you sit down?

1:46:29.091 --> 1:46:31.051
I'll be brief and to the point.

1:46:31.135 --> 1:46:33.303
My husband feels
he has enough evidence

1:46:33.429 --> 1:46:35.472
to prove that Sir Charles
is the Phantom

1:46:35.598 --> 1:46:37.640
and to convict George
as his accomplice.

1:46:37.767 --> 1:46:40.560
As I see it,
they only have one chance.

1:46:40.644 --> 1:46:42.479
What is that?

1:46:42.563 --> 1:46:45.398
If Your Highness were
to testify on their behalf,

1:46:45.483 --> 1:46:49.736
somehow convince the jury
they didn't take the diamond.

1:46:49.820 --> 1:46:52.614
- You surprise me, Madame.
- I expect to.

1:46:52.698 --> 1:46:57.035
I'm taking the chance you will keep
what I tell you in the strictest confidence.

1:46:57.244 --> 1:47:01.414
- I think I can guess.
- It's not too difficult.

1:47:01.499 --> 1:47:03.500
Being the wife
of Inspector Clouseau,

1:47:03.626 --> 1:47:06.753
you could have been
very helpful to Charles.

1:47:07.838 --> 1:47:09.589
I have been.

1:47:09.673 --> 1:47:13.134
Was stealing my dog
all part of the plan?

1:47:13.219 --> 1:47:15.053
That was the plan.

1:47:15.679 --> 1:47:19.224
But I think you should know
that Charles wanted to call it off.

1:47:44.375 --> 1:47:46.042
You've had it all the time.

1:47:46.168 --> 1:47:47.877
You stole the jewel yourself

1:47:48.003 --> 1:47:49.963
before the International Court
made its decision.

1:47:50.047 --> 1:47:54.634
I'd sacrifice it to save Charles,
but it's not so simple.

1:47:54.718 --> 1:47:57.512
Couldn't you say you found it
on the grounds or something?

1:47:57.596 --> 1:48:00.056
They'd just claim he dropped it
making his escape.

1:48:00.141 --> 1:48:04.060
No, to save Charles, we must prove
that someone else stole it.

1:48:04.145 --> 1:48:06.229
But we'd never
be able to do that.

1:48:07.022 --> 1:48:08.231
I have an idea.

1:48:11.902 --> 1:48:14.445
The trial is in its third day.

1:48:14.572 --> 1:48:16.656
Seldom in the history
of Italian jurisprudence

1:48:16.740 --> 1:48:19.284
has a trial created
such intense excitement.

1:48:19.368 --> 1:48:20.535
Thousands of people...

1:48:20.619 --> 1:48:22.495
and it is interesting to note,
most of them women...

1:48:22.580 --> 1:48:24.497
have gathered daily
hoping to catch a glimpse

1:48:24.582 --> 1:48:25.915
of Sir Charles Litton,

1:48:26.125 --> 1:48:29.043
the man accused of being
the notorious Phantom.

1:48:29.128 --> 1:48:32.213
The court adjourned yesterday
as the defense requested time

1:48:32.298 --> 1:48:34.716
to investigate certain
new, important evidence.

1:48:34.800 --> 1:48:37.844
And it is rumored that when
the court convenes today,

1:48:37.928 --> 1:48:40.096
the defense will call
a surprise witness.

1:48:40.556 --> 1:48:42.974
The defense has only
one witness, Mr. President.

1:48:43.058 --> 1:48:46.436
Would you call Inspector
Jacques Clouseau to the stand?

1:48:48.439 --> 1:48:49.856
Me, a defense witness?

1:48:50.399 --> 1:48:52.025
Inspector Clouseau?

1:48:52.109 --> 1:48:55.612
Nothing to worry about.
You'll make fools out of them.

1:49:06.165 --> 1:49:09.209
Inspector Clouseau,
you have testified under oath

1:49:09.293 --> 1:49:12.754
to certain pertinent facts
concerning this case.

1:49:12.838 --> 1:49:14.714
Your testimony
and your testimony alone

1:49:14.840 --> 1:49:18.718
has been the major factor
in casting suspicion on the defendant.

1:49:18.802 --> 1:49:20.386
Aside from the Phantom himself,

1:49:20.471 --> 1:49:23.848
you are the foremost authority
on the Phantom.

1:49:25.100 --> 1:49:28.228
I have made
the Phantom my life's work.

1:49:28.312 --> 1:49:31.648
You've testified the Phantom
has been a frequent guest

1:49:31.732 --> 1:49:34.150
at the numerous parties
given by Miss Angela Dunning.

1:49:34.276 --> 1:49:35.860
That is correct, yes.

1:49:35.945 --> 1:49:40.031
You've testified it was either during
or sometime soon afterwards

1:49:40.157 --> 1:49:43.576
that certain of Miss Dunning's guests
were robbed of their jewels.

1:49:43.661 --> 1:49:44.702
Yes.

1:49:45.746 --> 1:49:49.707
- How many times did this happen?
- Sixteen.

1:49:49.833 --> 1:49:53.002
- Sixteen parties, sixteen thefts?
- Yes.

1:49:53.128 --> 1:49:56.214
- Sir Charles attended all sixteen?
- All of them.

1:49:56.382 --> 1:49:59.050
And how many of those parties
did you attend, Inspector?

1:49:59.927 --> 1:50:01.302
All of them.

1:50:03.013 --> 1:50:04.472
Very interesting.

1:50:05.641 --> 1:50:08.351
You attended the first party
when the jewels were stolen?

1:50:08.477 --> 1:50:09.769
Yes.

1:50:09.853 --> 1:50:12.563
The jewels were stolen
during or after the party?

1:50:12.940 --> 1:50:14.857
After.

1:50:14.942 --> 1:50:17.193
You knew they were
going to be stolen?

1:50:17.278 --> 1:50:19.654
- Well, yes.
- How did you know?

1:50:19.738 --> 1:50:22.448
That is the modus operandi
of the Phantom.

1:50:22.533 --> 1:50:24.617
He always works that way.

1:50:25.119 --> 1:50:26.577
I see.

1:50:28.330 --> 1:50:31.874
Were the same people
always present at each party?

1:50:31.959 --> 1:50:34.168
No, the guest lists varied.

1:50:34.712 --> 1:50:36.129
Outside of Sir Charles,

1:50:36.213 --> 1:50:38.881
was anybody else always present
at each of these parties?

1:50:41.176 --> 1:50:42.468
No.

1:50:42.553 --> 1:50:46.681
Only Sir Charles was present at
each party when there was a robbery?

1:50:47.474 --> 1:50:49.726
- Yes.
- I see.

1:50:51.353 --> 1:50:54.188
- And what about you?
- Me?

1:50:54.273 --> 1:50:57.442
- Yes, you.
- What about me?

1:50:57.526 --> 1:50:59.527
- You were there.
- Yes.

1:50:59.611 --> 1:51:03.698
Then Sir Charles was not
the only one present at each party.

1:51:03.782 --> 1:51:05.074
What are you suggesting?

1:51:05.159 --> 1:51:08.911
I'm not suggesting
anything... yet.

1:51:12.583 --> 1:51:14.417
Inspector Clouseau?

1:51:15.586 --> 1:51:17.420
How much money do you make?

1:51:19.548 --> 1:51:21.841
- What has this got to do with it?
- Your salary...

1:51:21.925 --> 1:51:25.094
How much does
a police inspector get paid?

1:51:25.262 --> 1:51:29.349
Enough to buy a wife
a $10,000 mink coat?

1:51:29.433 --> 1:51:30.850
No, of course not.

1:51:30.934 --> 1:51:34.437
You're aware your wife spent $7,000
at Yves St. Laurent only last month?

1:51:36.398 --> 1:51:37.774
What?

1:51:37.858 --> 1:51:41.736
- Two months before that, $4,000.
- That's impossible.

1:51:41.820 --> 1:51:45.573
Your wife spent at least $30,000
on clothes during the past year.

1:51:45.657 --> 1:51:47.283
Sir, my wife is very frugal.

1:51:47.368 --> 1:51:50.370
She saves out of
the housekeeping money.

1:51:55.417 --> 1:51:58.378
$30,000 out of
the housekeeping money.

1:51:58.462 --> 1:52:00.505
We have been
married for ten years.

1:52:03.384 --> 1:52:05.510
About the time that
these robberies began

1:52:05.594 --> 1:52:08.262
and the notorious Phantom
came into existence, correct?

1:52:08.347 --> 1:52:10.973
Yes! No, not correct!

1:52:11.058 --> 1:52:13.976
Of course, not correct.
Of course...

1:52:14.061 --> 1:52:18.022
All right, wait. You see...

1:52:19.066 --> 1:52:22.151
- It's not Sir Charles!
- He must be the Phantom!

1:52:22.277 --> 1:52:24.612
It must be the inspector.

1:52:26.657 --> 1:52:27.782
He's the Phantom!

1:52:28.325 --> 1:52:29.367
Now...

1:52:56.687 --> 1:52:59.522
No, I'm not the Phantom!
No, please! Please!

1:53:07.614 --> 1:53:10.408
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank the princess.

1:53:10.534 --> 1:53:13.828
- Look at that.
- No, no! I'm not the Phantom!

1:53:13.912 --> 1:53:15.872
No, no, no!
I'm not the Phantom!

1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:18.833
We can't just let him
rot in prison.

1:53:18.917 --> 1:53:20.918
It takes years
for people to rot.

1:53:21.044 --> 1:53:23.296
Besides, when the Phantom
strikes again,

1:53:23.380 --> 1:53:25.381
the inspector will be
as free as a bird.

1:53:25.507 --> 1:53:28.134
Want to come to South America,
George? Family rates?

1:53:28.218 --> 1:53:30.470
- I wouldn't miss it, Uncle Charles.
- That's good.

1:53:30.554 --> 1:53:34.557
When I retire, you might
take over the business.

1:53:46.778 --> 1:53:48.905
Go back! Go home!

1:53:50.657 --> 1:53:52.033
Crazy woman.

1:53:52.117 --> 1:53:54.368
She's the one who tried
to tear off all his clothes.

1:53:54.453 --> 1:53:57.622
- My wife.
- Wife?

1:53:57.748 --> 1:53:59.999
You can thank my mother
for the flowers.

1:54:00.083 --> 1:54:03.711
You're a national hero.
I envy you.

1:54:03.795 --> 1:54:05.171
I'm going to prison.

1:54:05.255 --> 1:54:08.382
A few years,
but after you get out...

1:54:14.264 --> 1:54:16.098
Tell me, Inspector...

1:54:16.183 --> 1:54:18.601
Signor Phantom...

1:54:18.685 --> 1:54:20.811
All those robberies...

1:54:20.896 --> 1:54:23.231
How did you ever manage it?

1:54:25.776 --> 1:54:27.485
You know...

1:54:29.446 --> 1:54:30.780
It wasn't easy.
