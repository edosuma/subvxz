00:01.054 --> 00:03.042
Previously on Royal Pains...

00:03.042 --> 00:04.233
I'm Emma.

00:04.264 --> 00:05.821
I'm a friend of Divya's.

00:05.875 --> 00:06.838
I'm Emma.

00:06.935 --> 00:08.301
I'm a friend of Jeremiah's.

00:08.301 --> 00:09.399
Appletini, please.

00:09.399 --> 00:11.557
- I'm Emma.
- Evan R. Lawson. Hi.

00:11.557 --> 00:14.211
- Where did your friend go?
- Emma said she was your friend.

00:14.258 --> 00:15.305
She told me the same thing.

00:15.305 --> 00:16.832
Emma told me she was a patient.

00:16.832 --> 00:18.855
Who were you looking for
today at Shadow Pond?

00:18.855 --> 00:20.384
I was looking for my father.

00:20.384 --> 00:21.928
Well, who is your father?

00:21.964 --> 00:25.224
I've heard many different things about you.

00:25.224 --> 00:28.526
Well, Emma has another
one to add to the list...

00:28.702 --> 00:29.847
The truth.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:40.073 --> 00:43.517
So with Hank back and the summer season here

00:43.546 --> 00:46.316
and Hankmed business picking up,

00:46.511 --> 00:50.213
you need to focus on work,
and we need to take a backseat.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.946
Okay, we do need to take a backseat

00:51.990 --> 00:53.522
but, uh, not because of me.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.435
You're working full-time with Russell.

00:55.435 --> 00:57.401
You're buying art. You're selling art.

00:57.401 --> 00:58.671
You're placing art.

00:58.697 --> 01:03.096
You are helping to run the Hampton's
office of Sutton and Chesterfield.

01:03.114 --> 01:04.736
Like, that's... that's huge.

01:04.785 --> 01:07.202
Nothing's more important than that, nothing.

01:07.585 --> 01:09.120
I love you.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.492
I love you.

01:10.492 --> 01:13.620
And I love the way this is going.

01:13.620 --> 01:16.270
Can I jump in? Verbally, of course.

01:16.461 --> 01:17.974
Because you...

01:18.061 --> 01:20.851
Well, we have just done

01:20.851 --> 01:24.104
such amazing work these past few months.

01:24.152 --> 01:26.362
I want to take a moment
to acknowledge you...

01:26.552 --> 01:28.691
Well, us.

01:28.734 --> 01:30.975
Thank you. Thanks, Bob.

01:31.020 --> 01:33.280
We're really happy with
how this has gone too.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.746
Not gone... going.

01:34.777 --> 01:35.727
It's a journey.

01:35.774 --> 01:39.003
Yeah, um, it's...

01:39.149 --> 01:40.748
- You want me to do it?
- Yeah.

01:40.748 --> 01:45.624
We... we feel that we are ready
to conclude our journey...

01:46.686 --> 01:47.990
Not our journey.

01:47.990 --> 01:48.817
No.

01:48.864 --> 01:50.080
No, we're... we're great.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.469
Um, our journey.

01:57.045 --> 02:00.291
It's like you said last session.
I found my center.

02:00.343 --> 02:01.710
- Paige found her center.
- Yeah.

02:01.740 --> 02:04.491
So, really, we're totally centered.

02:05.204 --> 02:06.822
If you really feel that way,

02:07.242 --> 02:10.860
far be it from me to deny you your feelings.

02:10.860 --> 02:13.232
Congratulations.

02:13.260 --> 02:16.273
Can I jump in, not verbally, physically?

02:16.273 --> 02:18.128
Sure.

02:24.350 --> 02:26.437
- Henry.
- Hey.

02:26.489 --> 02:28.104
You left me five voice mails.

02:28.156 --> 02:29.509
What's the big emergency?

02:29.509 --> 02:31.589
We won at therapy, by the
way. I found my center.

02:31.637 --> 02:33.054
That's great. Listen, um...

02:33.759 --> 02:35.544
What I'm about to say is gonna sound crazy,

02:35.584 --> 02:37.370
and there's really no way to couch it.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.978
- Already bored.
- We have a sister.

02:40.683 --> 02:42.982
- We have a sister?
- We have a sister.

02:43.377 --> 02:45.679
Her name's Emma Miller. She's 18.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.638
- Come on.
- I told you it's gonna sound crazy.

02:50.286 --> 02:52.179
Where is this sister?

02:52.229 --> 02:53.263
Emma. Her name's Emma.

02:53.308 --> 02:55.283
And she's out on the patio.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.431
Now, just tell me,
are you up for meeting her,

02:57.431 --> 02:59.687
or do you need some time
to process this first?

03:01.185 --> 03:02.398
Okay.

03:03.733 --> 03:05.598
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

03:06.008 --> 03:07.198
Oh, it's you.

03:08.055 --> 03:10.740
- We met at the puja.
- Yeah.

03:11.036 --> 03:12.516
Appletini, right?

03:12.561 --> 03:13.776
That's me.

03:14.743 --> 03:17.132
So you're our sister, huh?

03:17.521 --> 03:18.580
Yeah.

03:19.022 --> 03:22.156
I-I didn't say anything because I wasn't
looking for you or for Hank.

03:22.178 --> 03:24.592
Yeah, right, um, she came here to meet dad.

03:25.009 --> 03:26.163
Dad?

03:26.220 --> 03:29.431
Yeah, I thought he was in the Hamptons.

03:29.471 --> 03:31.757
Yeah, he's not. He's in Mexico.

03:31.804 --> 03:33.691
He's whale watching and staying in a yurt.

03:33.749 --> 03:35.235
Yeah. No, I filled her in.

03:36.368 --> 03:37.540
So...

03:38.398 --> 03:41.293
All right, uh, no offense or anything,

03:41.328 --> 03:43.239
but you just kind of
showed up out of nowhere,

03:43.294 --> 03:44.795
so why should we believe you?

03:44.855 --> 03:46.614
I-I have DNA proof.

03:46.658 --> 03:48.884
Oh, yeah. No one has DNA proof these days.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.485
Okay, um...

03:51.485 --> 03:55.317
Honestly, this is why I wanted
to talk to him, not you guys.

03:55.395 --> 03:56.782
Does dad know about this?

03:56.823 --> 04:00.208
That she's in town, no.
That she exists, yeah.

04:00.358 --> 04:02.087
- That was my first question.
- What?

04:02.537 --> 04:04.873
He deserted us.

04:05.227 --> 04:07.920
He met my mom, Meredith,
when they were both in St. Louis...

04:07.920 --> 04:09.057
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:09.117 --> 04:10.171
Chapter ten, dad's book...

04:10.226 --> 04:11.482
He talks about a Meredith.

04:11.526 --> 04:13.135
I know. I know.

04:13.161 --> 04:15.934
Okay, I-I didn't mean to upset you guys.

04:15.934 --> 04:17.221
This was a mistake.

04:17.267 --> 04:20.762
I-I should have just waited to talk to him.

04:20.762 --> 04:22.002
No, no, no, no. Wait, Emma.

04:22.019 --> 04:23.089
Please don't go.

04:23.136 --> 04:25.129
Evan still needs some time to process this,

04:25.166 --> 04:26.657
and to be honest, so do I.

04:26.998 --> 04:28.249
Okay, I'm going to Europe.

04:28.284 --> 04:31.276
I can't really change my travel plans, um...

04:31.444 --> 04:33.075
But here, uh...

04:34.058 --> 04:36.420
Let me give you my contact information.

04:36.420 --> 04:37.542
Um...

04:38.628 --> 04:40.827
You know, maybe we can stay in touch.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.205
You're on Instagram, right?

04:43.253 --> 04:44.392
Great.

04:48.523 --> 04:50.110
What just happened?

04:51.284 --> 04:53.016
I lost my center.

05:06.532 --> 05:09.265
I mean, this can't be true, Henry.

05:09.304 --> 05:10.854
You know, I had the same reaction you did.

05:10.886 --> 05:12.540
- But now that I've slept on it...
- I know.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.675
Oh, it's ringing.

05:14.518 --> 05:15.518
Voice mail.

05:15.562 --> 05:16.675
Oh, just tell him on the voice mail.

05:16.675 --> 05:19.701
Okay, uh, dad, look, I know it's gonna
be tough to reach you this week, but...

05:19.733 --> 05:21.139
- Just tell him.
- - In case you get this...

05:21.190 --> 05:22.762
- Tell him.
- It's important that you call us.

05:22.805 --> 05:24.049
- Tell him.
- Bye.

05:24.475 --> 05:25.379
You didn't tell him.

05:25.416 --> 05:27.200
I can't tell the man his
daughter's here in a voice mail.

05:27.245 --> 05:27.999
Oh, my God.

05:27.999 --> 05:29.911
We don't know she's his daughter, Hank.

05:29.947 --> 05:30.961
Why would she make it up?

05:30.961 --> 05:32.275
I can think of a million reasons why.

05:32.313 --> 05:33.824
Okay, great. Name one.

05:34.397 --> 05:36.927
Maybe she believes he's her
father, but she's mistaken.

05:36.968 --> 05:39.141
Okay, think about this.
What if she's not mistaken?

05:39.141 --> 05:40.543
She is mistaken, Henry.

05:40.556 --> 05:41.872
None of this fits.

05:41.872 --> 05:43.926
It just... It doesn't sound like dad.

05:43.967 --> 05:45.740
You mean the guy who walked out on us,

05:45.857 --> 05:47.421
the guy who built a wind farm,

05:47.589 --> 05:49.368
the guy who served time?

05:50.521 --> 05:52.700
What if the new Eddie
has been a complete lie?

05:53.265 --> 05:54.660
What else could dad be hiding?

05:54.697 --> 05:56.094
What if there are others, Henry?

05:56.138 --> 05:58.749
What if dad just fornicated
his way across the country

05:58.790 --> 06:00.852
and we have 18 siblings we've never met?

06:00.896 --> 06:01.549
No, I'm not saying that.

06:01.592 --> 06:04.974
I'm just saying let's try and hold our
judgment on dad and Emma and all of this

06:05.013 --> 06:06.564
until we get the facts.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.665
Yeah, Ken, you're really on death's door.

06:23.589 --> 06:25.265
I'm not the patient, Hank. He is.

06:25.304 --> 06:26.271
That's a do-over.

06:26.311 --> 06:29.290
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Hank.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.365
I'm a doctor who thought
he was here to see Ken.

06:31.412 --> 06:32.382
Hi. I'm Aaron.

06:32.382 --> 06:34.485
I'm the head tennis pro
who told Ken I was fine.

06:34.485 --> 06:36.510
I just had some nausea after
dinner last night with him.

06:36.547 --> 06:37.710
So far, that's not a symptom.

06:37.746 --> 06:38.823
Oh, so you've eaten with Ken too?

06:38.823 --> 06:40.305
Yes, I have.

06:40.369 --> 06:41.645
Seriously, I'm good.

06:41.686 --> 06:43.708
Ken's just very
overprotective of his clients.

06:43.708 --> 06:46.099
Ah. I wish he felt that
way about his doctors.

06:46.466 --> 06:48.145
Damn it.

06:48.171 --> 06:50.560
Ken, you got to stop
trying for so much topspin.

06:50.609 --> 06:52.036
Yeah, a little less topspin, Ken.

06:52.036 --> 06:52.809
Sorry, guys.

06:52.855 --> 06:54.859
Never-stop-trying is my middle name, okay?

06:54.892 --> 06:56.012
It's hyphenated.

06:56.012 --> 06:57.154
Oh, it's hyphenated.

06:58.383 --> 06:59.841
She is so gonna kick his butt.

06:59.841 --> 07:01.991
Fantastic. I will clear my schedule.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.595
On second thought, now that he reps her,

07:03.615 --> 07:05.016
she will let him win.

07:05.308 --> 07:06.626
Oh, she's his client.

07:06.662 --> 07:08.378
I thought she was yet
another new girlfriend.

07:08.378 --> 07:09.915
Tracy's my best pro...

07:09.942 --> 07:12.500
And probably the best player
in Hamptons right now.

07:13.113 --> 07:15.964
She is the real deal. She's special...

07:15.964 --> 07:17.692
Damn it.

07:17.869 --> 07:20.327
And also the reason I
didn't call off your visit.

07:26.581 --> 07:28.261
Tracy's game's been off.

07:28.295 --> 07:31.029
It's her footwork, her timing...
It's just not right.

07:31.073 --> 07:32.217
She says she feels great,

07:32.249 --> 07:34.075
but I think it has to do with her injury.

07:34.118 --> 07:35.279
What happened?

07:35.320 --> 07:37.784
She tore her hamstring last
year at the Tallassee open,

07:37.784 --> 07:39.814
dropped out of the tourney
and dropped off the map.

07:39.839 --> 07:42.226
She moved to Costa Rica
and cut off the world.

07:42.258 --> 07:44.340
Well, looks like she reconnected.

07:44.846 --> 07:47.555
Yeah, I needed a female pro,

07:47.589 --> 07:49.836
and she wants to compete again.

07:49.836 --> 07:51.845
But you don't think she's 100%.

07:51.845 --> 07:54.987
At 90%, she could clean the
court with just about anybody.

07:54.987 --> 07:57.596
Ken saw her hit yesterday and
insisted that I introduce him

07:57.596 --> 07:59.036
before some other agent snagged her.

07:59.036 --> 08:00.413
- Of course.
- That's what dinner was last night.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.757
- Ah.
- But something is not right.

08:03.564 --> 08:05.782
If she's still hurt, she
could reaggravate the injury,

08:05.826 --> 08:07.265
which would be bad for my business,

08:07.265 --> 08:09.762
but worse, it could end her career.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.508
She's too good for that.

08:11.508 --> 08:13.572
- Okay, I'll talk to her.
- No, don't.

08:13.614 --> 08:16.130
- Now I'm confused.
- She'll think I said something.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.415
Tracy is incredibly stubborn
on the court and off.

08:19.714 --> 08:22.341
I was thinking you could give
physicals to all my pros.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.525
I will need them for
insurance at some point,

08:24.525 --> 08:26.449
and this way, Tracy
doesn't feel singled out.

08:26.492 --> 08:27.763
You've really thought this through.

08:27.803 --> 08:29.774
Tennis pros aren't all just
strong serves and great hair.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.003
No, they're not.

08:31.003 --> 08:32.484
- Ow!
- Oh!

08:32.912 --> 08:34.347
That's gonna leave a mark.

08:34.379 --> 08:35.715
- Oh, oh, Hank...
- I'm gonna...

08:35.760 --> 08:37.200
Ken? Kenneth?

08:55.942 --> 09:01.012
♪♪

09:03.950 --> 09:06.150
Guess who has a blouse full of spit-up.

09:06.189 --> 09:09.941
Oh, more importantly,
guess who rolled over today.

09:10.326 --> 09:11.521
Oh, Sashi.

09:12.466 --> 09:13.939
She's developmentally on target.

09:13.973 --> 09:16.085
Babies begin rolling over at
approximately four months.

09:16.085 --> 09:18.982
It won't be long before I have
to worry about baby proofing.

09:29.550 --> 09:31.255
Did we interrupt you?

09:31.255 --> 09:33.561
Oh, no, I was just typing up the...

09:33.605 --> 09:35.420
the soap notes from last week's patients.

09:35.420 --> 09:37.183
You are becoming a workaholic.

09:37.183 --> 09:39.045
There's a lot to do running Hankmed.

09:39.125 --> 09:41.872
I didn't realize how much until
the summer season started.

09:41.872 --> 09:42.645
Mm.

09:43.861 --> 09:45.701
Um, now that Hank is back...

09:46.799 --> 09:49.563
Do you think I'll go back to
being just a Hankmed doctor?

09:49.563 --> 09:51.910
You should discuss that with Hank,

09:51.910 --> 09:53.693
but you should also know,
as medical director,

09:53.736 --> 09:55.611
you've done a wonderful job.

09:55.934 --> 09:57.243
I'm gonna change.

09:57.481 --> 09:59.461
Would you mind holding Sashi for me?

09:59.461 --> 10:00.455
Not at all.

10:05.947 --> 10:07.785
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.

10:10.107 --> 10:11.265
Hello, Sashi.

10:11.265 --> 10:12.956
How did it feel to roll over?

10:16.067 --> 10:18.909
Oh, no, not again, Jeremiah.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.081
It's okay.

10:20.081 --> 10:22.202
I take it as a sign she's
comfortable with me.

10:22.793 --> 10:24.866
And reflex is normal at this age.

10:25.519 --> 10:26.798
If we were smart,

10:26.798 --> 10:28.850
we would invest in a dry-cleaning business.

10:28.886 --> 10:29.508
Mm-hmm.

10:59.810 --> 11:02.292
So, any chance you're free
for a physical sometime?

11:02.292 --> 11:03.927
Physical? For me? Why?

11:04.199 --> 11:08.096
- Aaron had asked if...
- - Aaron asked you to give me a physical.

11:08.372 --> 11:09.806
I said I was fine.

11:09.847 --> 11:12.094
No, no, he asked me to
schedule them for all the pros.

11:12.419 --> 11:14.707
Plus, I did hear that you were injured.

11:14.707 --> 11:15.763
I'm good.

11:15.798 --> 11:17.941
Any part of you that's not good?

11:17.941 --> 11:20.033
Just some normal fatigue.

11:20.066 --> 11:22.714
I'm clawing my way back into playing shape,

11:22.714 --> 11:24.906
working here, signing with Ken,

11:24.906 --> 11:28.332
and hopefully nailing a spot in
the Palm Springs Tennis Classic.

11:28.370 --> 11:29.676
Sounds exhausting.

11:29.676 --> 11:32.728
I'll have plenty of time to be
exhausted when I stop playing,

11:32.770 --> 11:36.594
but until then, I have to play every point

11:36.630 --> 11:38.318
as if my life depended on it.

11:38.318 --> 11:39.662
Well, in order to help you do that,

11:39.662 --> 11:40.772
we should get you an MRI to make sure

11:40.802 --> 11:43.011
your hamstring looks as good as you feel.

11:43.739 --> 11:45.913
- Sure.
- Okay, great.

11:49.538 --> 11:52.702
Here it is... Steamboat Eddie,chapter ten.

11:54.329 --> 11:58.166
Ha-ha. Meredith in italics...

11:58.391 --> 12:00.333
St. Louis, 1996.

12:02.578 --> 12:04.984
"And even though Meredith
and I were ships passing,

12:05.017 --> 12:07.725
I will never forget a saying she lived by."

12:08.121 --> 12:09.045
What?

12:10.547 --> 12:12.390
"For every action, there's a consequence."

12:12.435 --> 12:13.716
Well, there's an understatement.

12:13.754 --> 12:15.502
It's kind of ironic, that's for sure.

12:15.810 --> 12:18.108
Oh, my go... where is she? She said noon.

12:18.146 --> 12:19.622
It's 12:15.

12:19.662 --> 12:22.672
To an 18-year-old, that's,
like, 30 minutes early.

12:22.704 --> 12:23.902
Relax.

12:23.942 --> 12:26.066
Please... Please stop saying relax.

12:26.109 --> 12:27.435
I'm not relaxed, Paige.

12:27.435 --> 12:29.362
I have a kid sister who
showed up out of nowhere,

12:29.393 --> 12:30.950
and she's really nice, and she's smart.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.639
But how do we...
how do we even know she's my sister?

12:32.674 --> 12:34.092
How do we know she's our sister, huh?

12:34.092 --> 12:36.503
Okay, Evan, think of what Bob would say.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.474
Stay centered.

12:38.474 --> 12:39.977
Breathe.

12:41.767 --> 12:42.737
I'm not calling her a liar.

12:42.780 --> 12:43.841
I'm just saying that why
should we believe her,

12:43.880 --> 12:44.997
'cause she just shows up and says it?

12:44.997 --> 12:45.984
She has DNA proof.

12:46.008 --> 12:47.931
What are you, a molecular
biologist all of a sudden?

12:48.362 --> 12:49.654
I'm sorry.

12:49.834 --> 12:51.488
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:51.998 --> 12:53.743
We don't know what she wants.

12:53.743 --> 12:55.379
We don't know who she is.

12:55.743 --> 12:57.269
We know nothing about her.

12:57.305 --> 13:00.035
Which is why we are here to
get her to come to dinner,

13:00.068 --> 13:02.039
but if you want to keep snapping at me,

13:02.077 --> 13:03.985
maybe you should be doing this by yourself.

13:03.985 --> 13:06.521
No, no, I can't. I need you. Please.

13:08.468 --> 13:09.946
Oh, there she is right there.

13:12.242 --> 13:14.294
There goes my theory
she's after dad's money.

13:14.331 --> 13:15.417
What money?

13:17.053 --> 13:18.160
Hey.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.446
Thanks.

13:22.127 --> 13:24.240
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.137
You must be Paige. I'm Emma.

13:26.177 --> 13:27.639
It's so nice to meet you.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.367
Oh, uh, doing your homework?

13:31.551 --> 13:33.860
He, uh, doesn't believe I'm his sister.

13:33.894 --> 13:34.877
I didn't say that.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.224
I mean, it's fine. I don't blame you.

13:37.258 --> 13:38.740
If some kid showed up
and said what I'm saying

13:38.740 --> 13:41.311
I'd call her a liar and tell
her to shut the front door.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.473
What did you say?

13:43.473 --> 13:44.505
What?

13:45.175 --> 13:48.335
That's a... that's an expression
that someone I know uses.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.782
Eddie.

13:49.804 --> 13:53.320
Listen, Emma, we're so
happy you had the courage

13:53.359 --> 13:56.861
to come to the Hamptons
and to meet Hank and Evan,

13:57.059 --> 14:00.068
and we just don't want you to get
away without getting to know you...

14:00.886 --> 14:02.281
Right, Evan?

14:02.313 --> 14:03.845
Right. Yeah.

14:04.898 --> 14:08.361
Well, it, uh, means a lot
that you're even pretending,

14:08.391 --> 14:10.984
but unfortunately, I don't think I can.

14:11.114 --> 14:13.496
- Well, that's too bad.
- Yeah.

14:14.681 --> 14:16.717
By the way, I-I love your bag.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.471
Is it from Berkeley's on Main?

14:18.508 --> 14:20.190
Yeah, how did you know?

14:20.238 --> 14:21.660
I saw it in their window.

14:23.078 --> 14:25.937
Look, I'm having lunch,
and I would love to talk more,

14:25.983 --> 14:27.108
but I actually have to get inside.

14:27.148 --> 14:28.846
My friends are waiting. I'm sorry.

14:28.889 --> 14:31.835
Well, will you just think
about coming to dinner tonight?

14:33.034 --> 14:34.138
I can't.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.026
I have so much to do before Europe.

14:36.352 --> 14:37.729
Sorry.

14:38.973 --> 14:40.287
You should come.

14:42.354 --> 14:43.288
I mean...

14:43.955 --> 14:45.015
Yeah...

14:45.855 --> 14:48.022
I think it would mean a lot to...

14:48.732 --> 14:50.382
Us... You know, all of us,

14:51.826 --> 14:53.183
and, uh...

14:53.183 --> 14:54.891
And I'm not pretending.

14:56.130 --> 14:57.255
Okay.

14:58.596 --> 15:00.269
Who could say no to that?

15:02.130 --> 15:03.358

- Yeah?

16:20.702 --> 16:23.016
I love how attentive you are to Sashi.

16:23.060 --> 16:25.800
Wha... oh. Have I been helicoptering?

16:25.840 --> 16:26.913
Just a smidge.

16:26.913 --> 16:28.764
I just want to make up

16:28.789 --> 16:31.527
for every smile, hiccup,
and poopy diaper I missed.

16:31.568 --> 16:33.362
Perfect. So I'll call you
at 2:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M.

16:33.413 --> 16:34.899
every morning for the next 12 months.

16:34.921 --> 16:36.751
Okay, all right, I'll back off.

16:37.199 --> 16:39.260
You've probably got your
hands full at Jeremiah's.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.315
I mean, he must be constantly
cleaning every surface,

16:41.358 --> 16:42.421
picking up every binky...

16:42.465 --> 16:45.956
Actually, he has been
surprisingly, shockingly serene.

16:45.993 --> 16:48.529
I was worried that we
would give him a nervous breakdown,

16:48.568 --> 16:51.082
but I think that the
company is good for him.

16:51.369 --> 16:53.119
I'm happy to hear that.

16:53.156 --> 16:55.114
How much longer you think
you can stay with him?

16:55.144 --> 16:56.431
I hate imposing.

16:56.431 --> 16:58.048
I thought for sure we'd be gone by now,

16:58.077 --> 16:59.920
but after the C-section,

17:00.207 --> 17:01.896
- I needed the help.
- Right.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.538
Well, if you ever need a place,

17:03.572 --> 17:05.506
you two can always crash with Uncle Hank.

17:05.536 --> 17:06.480
That's very kind,

17:06.521 --> 17:08.580
and I'm not the only one
with a new family member.

17:08.621 --> 17:11.525
- How is all that going?
- I don't know, you know.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.147
You can't prepare for something like this.

17:13.196 --> 17:14.461
- At first, I thought I was totally fine...
- Hey, guys.

17:14.497 --> 17:15.670
I'm so sorry I'm late.

17:15.712 --> 17:18.505
I had a lesson with the Sander twins.

17:18.535 --> 17:20.730
They were locked in a five-set death match.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.348
Most competitive
eight-year-olds I've ever seen.

17:23.378 --> 17:25.319
Hmm. Uh, should we get started?

17:25.531 --> 17:26.597
Okay.

17:32.483 --> 17:33.602
All right.

17:40.170 --> 17:43.227
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow.

17:45.577 --> 17:46.553
Okay.

17:46.896 --> 17:48.269
Everything looks good.

17:49.093 --> 17:50.870
I'll call the hospital and let
them know we're on our way.

17:50.891 --> 17:51.542
Okay.

17:53.356 --> 17:55.829
- The hospital?
- Yeah, for the MRI.

17:56.251 --> 17:59.519
Tracy, we want to make sure
your hamstring is fully healed.

17:59.519 --> 18:01.047
You don't want to reaggravate it.

18:01.231 --> 18:02.462
I won't.

18:02.971 --> 18:04.457
How can you be so sure?

18:06.619 --> 18:07.933
Because I...

18:07.969 --> 18:10.017
I never had a torn hamstring, Hank.

18:10.814 --> 18:14.210
I, um, had a broken heart.

18:17.018 --> 18:18.661
That's why I quit playing.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.640
I couldn't focus on tennis or on anything,

18:22.640 --> 18:27.090
so I faked the injury and
then moved to Costa Rica

18:27.120 --> 18:29.947
to get as far away from
the pain as possible.

18:30.739 --> 18:32.207
I'm sorry.

18:32.468 --> 18:34.795
Don't be. I'm much better now.

18:35.295 --> 18:37.514
You know what? Tennis saved me.

18:37.546 --> 18:39.542
I realized how much I love it,

18:39.937 --> 18:42.933
and being back in the
Hamptons has really helped me.

18:42.976 --> 18:43.785
I...

18:44.223 --> 18:48.092
My focus is back, and I am
ready to play every point

18:48.092 --> 18:49.891
like my life depended on it.

18:58.195 --> 18:59.187
You the doc?

18:59.236 --> 19:01.689
Yes, I'm Dr. Jeremiah Sacani.

19:01.720 --> 19:02.747
Whoops.

19:03.313 --> 19:04.547
Yeah.

19:05.847 --> 19:06.852
Um...

19:09.478 --> 19:11.642
How did you get a knife stuck in your hand?

19:11.681 --> 19:13.286
It's pretty dead here in the afternoon,

19:13.328 --> 19:15.737
so I was teaching myself a knife trick.

19:15.768 --> 19:17.591
Still kind of learning this one.

19:17.887 --> 19:19.962
I had dinner at Benihana last week.

19:22.321 --> 19:23.971
Anesthesia.

19:27.490 --> 19:29.429
Okay, pretty good capillary refill.

19:29.429 --> 19:32.547
Um, I should make sure you haven't
injured any pertinent structures.

19:32.547 --> 19:33.496
What are you doing?

19:33.539 --> 19:34.871
It's a digital Allen test,

19:34.915 --> 19:36.597
followed by a two-point discrimination.

19:36.730 --> 19:40.344
When I let go, the blood should return
to your hand in less than seven seconds.

19:41.252 --> 19:42.146
Cool.

19:42.188 --> 19:43.688
Can you move that thumb for me?

19:44.354 --> 19:45.388
Just a little.

19:45.899 --> 19:47.141
And the index?

19:47.610 --> 19:48.274
Okay.

19:53.870 --> 19:55.031
Ow.

19:55.325 --> 19:57.147
Now, was that "ow" in one or two spots?

19:57.184 --> 19:58.648
- Two.
- Oh, great.

19:58.685 --> 20:03.169
Um, it looks like you missed the superficial
and the deep palmar arterial arches,

20:03.208 --> 20:06.979
as well as the flexor and extensor
tendons and the digital nerves.

20:06.989 --> 20:12.007
Fortunately, the knife landed parallel to
the metacarpals in the proximal web space.

20:12.007 --> 20:13.967
Well, I made sure not to remove the knife.

20:14.002 --> 20:15.829
I know that's the worst thing you can do.

20:17.886 --> 20:19.437
You're not supposed to take it out.

20:19.437 --> 20:21.061
I can put it back in if you like.

20:25.584 --> 20:27.308
So this place is quiet in the afternoon?

20:28.297 --> 20:30.677
Yeah, between 3:00 and 5:00 P.M.,

20:30.708 --> 20:32.210
it's a total graveyard.

20:36.617 --> 20:38.995
Yeah, so I'm taking the
year off before college,

20:39.017 --> 20:41.540
and I figured that New York
would be the perfect stopover

20:41.540 --> 20:43.336
if I wanted to meet my father.

20:43.706 --> 20:45.387
Does your mom know you're here?

20:45.415 --> 20:48.364
Yeah, she wasn't exactly
thrilled at the idea.

20:48.418 --> 20:50.154
I mean, she's not Eddie's biggest fan.

20:50.197 --> 20:50.947
Right.

20:50.991 --> 20:52.868
Well, we can understand how she feels.

20:52.868 --> 20:56.146
You know what? On behalf
of all Lawsons everywhere,

20:56.195 --> 20:58.996
let me apologize for dad walking out on you,

20:58.996 --> 21:01.958
'cause it's... well, we know;
We've... we've been there.

21:01.958 --> 21:02.739
Yeah, we have.

21:02.779 --> 21:04.293
- He's not the same guy he used to be.
- No.

21:04.336 --> 21:06.086
Yeah, he really is a very sweet man.

21:06.086 --> 21:08.170
- Mm-hmm.
- He's awesome. He really is.

21:09.297 --> 21:12.352
Oh, my gosh. She is so cute.

21:12.797 --> 21:14.895
How old is she... about four months?

21:14.895 --> 21:16.484
- Exactly.
- Not bad.

21:17.341 --> 21:18.792
- Do you like kids?
- Yeah.

21:18.824 --> 21:21.376
Yeah, I-I used to do a lot
of babysitting at home.

21:21.679 --> 21:24.576
Big Jim insisted that I learn
about earning my own money.

21:24.612 --> 21:25.734
Big Jim?

21:25.773 --> 21:27.431
Were you into wrestling back then?

21:28.542 --> 21:31.117
No, he was my mom's boyfriend.

21:31.272 --> 21:35.892
He was this crazy-rich oil baron
who swept us all off to Dallas

21:35.931 --> 21:37.612
where, you know, everything is bigger,

21:37.653 --> 21:40.410
or at least I thought
until I saw this place.

21:40.410 --> 21:42.268
- Is that where you go school?
- Uh, went.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.628
Yeah, um, right outside Dallas...

21:44.628 --> 21:46.660
Um, Brampton Academy.

21:47.024 --> 21:48.783
Oh, my gosh. It was so Texas.

21:48.821 --> 21:51.927
Girls' hair had, like, a
minimum height requirement.

21:53.448 --> 21:56.505
Emma, it's really nice just
getting a chance to know you.

21:56.505 --> 21:58.464
Is there any chance you
could stay a little longer?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.625
Dad should be back in a few days.

22:00.625 --> 22:01.495
Yeah.

22:01.495 --> 22:04.613
Well, my friends and I have been
planning this trip for so long.

22:04.613 --> 22:07.073
- Could you change your ticket?
- Maybe.

22:07.876 --> 22:09.876
Um, the tag...

22:10.269 --> 22:12.274
- Do you want some scissors?
- Uh, no.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.022
Just stay. Europe's not going anywhere.

22:18.060 --> 22:19.906
- It's been there for hundreds of years.
- Thousands.

22:20.233 --> 22:21.577
Even better.

22:21.577 --> 22:22.465
Yeah.

22:23.519 --> 22:25.199
Okay. Uh...

22:25.748 --> 22:29.064
Okay, I'll see if the Blackstone
can extend my reservation.

22:29.105 --> 22:30.446
- Great.
- Yes.

22:30.482 --> 22:31.545
Then it's settled.

22:31.687 --> 22:33.279
Everyone raise a glass.

22:34.930 --> 22:36.187
To Emma

22:36.294 --> 22:38.352
and how lucky we are to have the chance

22:38.397 --> 22:41.099
to make up for the 18 years we missed.

22:49.214 --> 22:49.928
Ahh.

23:01.830 --> 23:03.103
Hey, Hank.

23:03.302 --> 23:04.738
Oh, hey, Tamra.

23:04.780 --> 23:06.309
Surprised to see you out of the O.C.

23:06.346 --> 23:08.308
I'm surprised to see you.
Are you a member here?

23:08.308 --> 23:10.888
Well, you know how exclusive it is, so shh.

23:10.929 --> 23:12.891
- So you're not a member.
- Not even close, no.

23:12.931 --> 23:14.732
Well, I'm gonna head to
the fitness studio and...

23:14.882 --> 23:16.579
Nice seeing you. Okay, bye.

23:16.579 --> 23:19.703
Oh, love to Eddie and Sydney,
Spencer, Sophia, and Ryan.

23:19.703 --> 23:21.209
- Nailed it.
- Thank you.

23:24.010 --> 23:25.589
- Hank.
- Hey, Aaron.

23:28.707 --> 23:29.688
You want to hit?

23:29.721 --> 23:32.376
Uh, yeah, I just don't have a
racket, sneakers, or talent.

23:32.376 --> 23:33.727
Give me one lesson,

23:33.727 --> 23:35.529
and you can start hustling
on the doctor circuit.

23:35.529 --> 23:37.087
How about we do business first?

23:37.119 --> 23:38.924
I got the results from the physicals.

23:38.924 --> 23:40.833
Almost everyone did great.

23:40.833 --> 23:42.276
Almost everyone.

23:43.218 --> 23:45.099
- You mean Tracy?
- I mean you.

23:45.099 --> 23:46.578
You're the only one who didn't show.

23:46.822 --> 23:48.745
I run 6 miles a day

23:48.745 --> 23:50.606
and do 200 push-ups, 100 crunches,

23:50.643 --> 23:52.083
and play hours of tennis.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.945
I'd know if there's something
wrong with my body,

23:54.014 --> 23:56.180
and you should know there's
something wrong with Tracy's.

23:59.541 --> 24:00.993
Thank you.

24:00.993 --> 24:03.266
I might take 10%, but I give 100%.

24:03.417 --> 24:05.884
Guess who's playing in the
Palm Springs Tennis Classic.

24:05.922 --> 24:07.351
Guess whose genius made it happen.

24:07.392 --> 24:09.426
Well, congratulations to both of you.

24:09.458 --> 24:12.266
Pack your bags, baby, 'cause your days
as a lowly club pro... They're over.

24:12.312 --> 24:14.582
No offense... Harry?

24:15.105 --> 24:17.456
Hey, hey, you okay?

24:21.223 --> 24:22.928
That's it. Now, exhale.

24:24.167 --> 24:25.398
You okay?

24:25.698 --> 24:27.054
What do you think of my drop shot?

24:29.286 --> 24:31.020
I-I think it's just the heat.

24:31.057 --> 24:33.510
Another one? He's been having headaches.

24:34.758 --> 24:35.621
How did you know?

24:35.669 --> 24:37.015
Aaron, how long have you had them?

24:37.929 --> 24:38.913
Uh...

24:39.118 --> 24:40.459
Since mid-May,

24:40.501 --> 24:42.222
since we got back from Costa Rica

24:42.369 --> 24:44.367
and... and since the summer heat started.

24:44.401 --> 24:45.700
I-I just need to drink more water.

24:45.741 --> 24:47.783
I'm sorry. You were both in Costa Rica?

24:47.823 --> 24:50.924
That's where Aaron tracked me down
to convince me to come work here.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.256
Is Tracy in danger too?

24:52.256 --> 24:54.169
She's got this tournament that I got her.

24:54.353 --> 24:55.710
Ken, do you mind stepping away?

24:55.756 --> 24:57.526
I just... I need to talk to them medically.

24:57.550 --> 24:59.367
No, we have agent-client confidentiality.

24:59.407 --> 25:01.562
Right, which would be great
if that were a real thing.

25:01.871 --> 25:03.363
It was worth a shot.

25:05.091 --> 25:06.276
When you were in Costa Rica,

25:06.301 --> 25:08.379
did you two live in close quarters?

25:08.379 --> 25:10.363
No, we don't do that anymore.

25:10.363 --> 25:13.070
We... we dated but ended it last year.

25:13.912 --> 25:17.378
Ah, okay, um, did any of you get
any bug bites when you were there?

25:17.422 --> 25:19.260
Have you been to Costa Rica?

25:19.296 --> 25:20.164
When you get off the plane,

25:20.164 --> 25:21.269
they should welcome you with,

25:21.269 --> 25:23.893
"welcome to paradise. You are no
longer the top of the food chain."

25:24.451 --> 25:26.802
Okay, I need to draw some blood
and test you both for parasites.

25:27.082 --> 25:28.542
Parasites?

25:28.542 --> 25:31.390
Yeah, you could have something
called Chagas Disease.

25:31.390 --> 25:34.209
It's a tropical illness
caused by triatomine bites.

25:34.209 --> 25:36.114
These bugs are common in central America,

25:36.164 --> 25:39.907
and the bites can cause fevers, headaches,
rashes, and severe body fatigue...

25:39.907 --> 25:42.444
Symptoms that are especially
problematic for an athlete.

25:42.545 --> 25:44.583
But you said the physicals were clean.

25:44.583 --> 25:47.787
Yeah, well, some parasitic infections
don't show up in standard blood tests.

25:47.816 --> 25:50.777
And if we have this Chagas
Disease, is it treatable?

25:50.777 --> 25:52.077
Caught early, absolutely.

25:52.077 --> 25:53.924
And if it's not caught early?

25:53.945 --> 25:56.292
Let's not worry about that now.

25:56.292 --> 25:57.436
Too late.

26:01.776 --> 26:03.442
- Sorry, Jeremiah!
- No, that's okay.

26:21.562 --> 26:23.091
Are Aaron and Tracy okay?

26:23.134 --> 26:24.657
Uh, hopefully.

26:24.657 --> 26:26.411
We'll check their blood to make sure.

26:26.752 --> 26:27.884
What about you?

26:28.823 --> 26:30.066
What about me?

26:30.097 --> 26:31.520
I'm a little worried about you, Hank.

26:31.558 --> 26:32.882
I mean, there's no making fun of me.

26:32.922 --> 26:34.815
There's no biting comments.
There's no eye rolls.

26:34.847 --> 26:36.174
It's like you don't even care anymore.

26:37.798 --> 26:39.820
It... it's been a strange few days.

26:40.968 --> 26:42.691
It turns out I have a sister.

26:42.720 --> 26:43.922
Other than Evan?

26:43.922 --> 26:45.670
She's 18...

26:45.707 --> 26:47.740
A half sister, my father's daughter,

26:47.780 --> 26:49.833
and she just showed up here.

26:50.351 --> 26:52.415
- Wow. Surprise.
- Yeah, surprise.

26:53.095 --> 26:55.141
You happy, sad, angry?

26:55.141 --> 26:56.384
- Yes.
- Let me guess...

26:56.384 --> 26:58.194
Evan's freaking out, but you're stoic.

26:58.352 --> 26:59.799
You're a lot like me, Hank.

26:59.799 --> 27:02.829
A rock on the outside,
but we feel very deeply in here.

27:04.169 --> 27:06.351
Yeah. It's... it's been on my mind.

27:06.387 --> 27:07.675
That's heavy stuff.

27:08.536 --> 27:10.140
I don't know what to think.

27:10.140 --> 27:12.073
I dug out from underneath his craziness,

27:12.073 --> 27:13.888
but now it's all back, you know,

27:13.923 --> 27:15.445
after I finally make peace with him

27:15.487 --> 27:17.267
and... and how he's changed.

27:17.788 --> 27:20.106
And all along, he's had another kid...

27:20.137 --> 27:20.837
Hmm.

27:20.837 --> 27:22.376
This sweet girl.

27:22.683 --> 27:25.256
I'm having trouble remembering all
the reasons I forgave him, you know.

27:25.952 --> 27:28.723
It's just... it's hard to know what's real.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.867
We've got doctor-patient
confidentiality, right?

27:31.867 --> 27:33.130
Unfortunately, yes.

27:33.149 --> 27:35.506
Growing up, we were always competitive,

27:35.506 --> 27:36.619
even though I always won.

27:36.654 --> 27:37.578
Well, I don't know about that.

27:37.623 --> 27:39.608
And now I look at you sometimes,

27:39.648 --> 27:41.588
and I-I envy you.

27:42.016 --> 27:43.679
I mean, you got a lot
of people who love you,

27:43.716 --> 27:45.764
all these people who matter to you.

27:46.075 --> 27:48.449
No matter how many long-lost siblings pop up

27:48.479 --> 27:49.842
and no matter what your
crazy father's doing,

27:49.881 --> 27:52.675
you're always gonna have those
people keeping you strong.

27:53.410 --> 27:55.030
That is real.

27:55.030 --> 27:58.181
This girl has no idea how lucky
she is to have you as a brother.

28:02.388 --> 28:04.163
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, bring it in.

28:04.202 --> 28:05.680
- What?
- Bring it in. Come on.

28:05.697 --> 28:07.306
Oh, okay. Yeah.

28:07.778 --> 28:08.701
All right?

28:08.744 --> 28:10.514
And if you tell anyone I
said any of this stuff,

28:10.559 --> 28:12.161
I'm gonna sue you within
an inch of your life.

28:12.201 --> 28:14.474
I can assure you no one will
ever know this happened.

28:15.178 --> 28:16.242
Okay.

28:26.612 --> 28:28.048
You sure you're all right?

28:28.077 --> 28:29.634
I told you I'm fine.

28:30.174 --> 28:32.287
It's just, when we run,

28:32.323 --> 28:33.619
I'm always having to catch up to you,

28:33.645 --> 28:35.613
so I'm used to following
the back of your head.

28:35.613 --> 28:37.787
Yes, just like this. This is great. Perfect.

28:45.136 --> 28:46.473
I'm sensing...

28:46.516 --> 28:49.335
I'm just sensing that
you're still mad at me.

28:50.922 --> 28:52.136
What's going on?

28:52.889 --> 28:54.120
Is it Bob?

28:54.501 --> 28:56.811
Is it 'cause we'd normally be
in session with Bob right now?

28:56.845 --> 28:58.286
No, it's... it's...

28:58.726 --> 29:01.799
It's not you or Bob. It's Emma.

29:02.260 --> 29:04.533
You're not buying the whole
half sister thing either, huh?

29:04.533 --> 29:06.531
It's not that. Um...

29:07.308 --> 29:08.488
Last night at dinner,

29:08.518 --> 29:11.140
it seemed like she was trying too hard...

29:11.140 --> 29:12.992
All the talk about boarding school,

29:13.079 --> 29:15.784
and when I noticed the dress she
was wearing still had the tag on it,

29:15.784 --> 29:17.837
she looked really uncomfortable.

29:17.884 --> 29:22.329
Okay, well, I mean, she could have just
been embarrassed that you saw it, though.

29:22.362 --> 29:23.593
Well, I wondered the same thing.

29:23.593 --> 29:27.323
So I called her this morning
at the Blackstone to apologize

29:27.323 --> 29:29.976
and was told that no one with
her name was staying there.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.890
She could have just registered
under a different name.

29:31.929 --> 29:33.429
I mean, she wouldn't be
the first wealthy person

29:33.429 --> 29:34.834
to want to keep her
identity a secret, right?

29:34.834 --> 29:36.847
Maybe I see my younger self in Emma...

29:36.879 --> 29:38.501
- Uh-huh.
- All that privilege

29:38.537 --> 29:41.971
but still feeling like
she has to prove herself.

29:41.971 --> 29:45.246
Evan, she bought a new dress
just to have dinner with us.

29:45.462 --> 29:49.533
I think she's insecure and
probably very impressionable.

29:49.569 --> 29:50.847
You're worried about her.

29:51.096 --> 29:53.555
I-I know you have questions,

29:53.589 --> 29:56.531
but we don't know the people
she's hanging out with.

29:56.886 --> 29:59.330
I mean, what are they doing
there so late at night?

29:59.365 --> 30:00.575
Are they a bad influence?

30:00.575 --> 30:02.076
I didn't think much
about it when he told me,

30:02.112 --> 30:04.897
but when Hank drove her back
to the Blackstone last night,

30:04.917 --> 30:07.210
she actually had him take her
to the Flying Point instead,

30:07.252 --> 30:09.076
said she wanted to meet some friends.

30:09.076 --> 30:11.455
And did Hank meet any of these
friends at the Flying Point?

30:11.614 --> 30:13.235
We don't know how old they are.

30:13.235 --> 30:14.878
Don't forget... Emma's underage.

30:14.878 --> 30:18.155
No, she insisted that he drop her off.

30:18.189 --> 30:19.284
You see what I mean?

30:19.593 --> 30:22.976
Well, maybe we should meet
these friends of hers.

30:25.225 --> 30:27.150
Sure, I know her. Follow me.

30:38.251 --> 30:39.179
Emma?

30:43.001 --> 30:45.382
Evan, this way.

30:50.259 --> 30:51.847
Why are we going in the kitchen?

31:22.714 --> 31:25.027
- Hey.
- Oh, hello.

31:25.183 --> 31:27.080
I was just dropping off diapers for Divya.

31:27.123 --> 31:28.077
She ran out.

31:28.174 --> 31:29.892
Oh, well, that was nice of you.

31:30.027 --> 31:31.390
Are you leaving?

31:31.425 --> 31:32.535
Uh, well, since my house is empty,

31:32.577 --> 31:35.371
I thought I would go there
and catch up on work.

31:35.408 --> 31:37.234
Right. Um...

31:37.389 --> 31:38.659
Before you do...

31:41.816 --> 31:44.173
Jeremiah, I-I don't know
if I ever thanked you

31:44.209 --> 31:48.734
for taking over and... and
running Hankmed while I was gone.

31:48.734 --> 31:50.813
It... it was a great responsibility,

31:50.857 --> 31:52.379
which I-I took very seriously.

31:52.379 --> 31:53.389
I know.

31:54.935 --> 31:56.337
Last summer...

31:56.924 --> 31:58.858
We had our issues.

32:00.489 --> 32:04.150
Do you think we can ever get
back to where we once were?

32:04.824 --> 32:06.793
- No, I don't.
- Oh.

32:06.830 --> 32:09.204
We don't have to go backwards
in order to move forwards.

32:09.327 --> 32:11.185
That was then, and a lot's happened since,

32:11.512 --> 32:14.123
and I-I do enjoy working for Hankmed.

32:14.123 --> 32:16.739
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.

32:17.917 --> 32:19.304
So I assume, now that you're back,

32:19.304 --> 32:21.158
you'll want to resume running the company.

32:21.620 --> 32:24.448
Honestly, no.

32:24.448 --> 32:25.476
I don't.

32:25.616 --> 32:28.432
It's been heaven just treating patients.

32:29.228 --> 32:33.977
Jeremiah, how would you feel about
continuing to be Hankmed's medical director?

32:44.162 --> 32:45.845
Great. Great.

32:49.057 --> 32:50.634
Your blood smears are clean.

32:51.241 --> 32:53.461
Hank, I'm sorry if I was difficult earlier.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.122
I'm a concierge doctor in the Hamptons.

32:55.159 --> 32:56.492
That wasn't difficult.

32:56.748 --> 32:58.550
You don't want to challenge
me. I'm very competitive.

32:58.550 --> 32:59.598
Okay.

33:08.084 --> 33:09.629
Aaron, Aaron, you're not done yet.

33:09.667 --> 33:11.853
Tracy, are you okay?

33:20.324 --> 33:21.465
Tracy?

33:22.613 --> 33:24.940
Tracy? Tracy?

33:26.898 --> 33:28.923
Uh, not yet, Tracy. Not yet.

33:28.954 --> 33:30.071
She doesn't look good.

33:30.268 --> 33:31.906
Aaron, I'll take care of her.

33:31.906 --> 33:34.794
Aaron, let's take those leads
off and get you some water.

33:40.357 --> 33:41.201
Okay.

33:43.749 --> 33:46.957
Huh, these delta waves weren't
present during your physical.

33:47.002 --> 33:48.463
So why are they there now?

33:48.508 --> 33:50.544
They only appear when
you're having an attack.

33:50.581 --> 33:52.903
It's called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

33:52.926 --> 33:53.968
What is it?

33:54.010 --> 33:56.393
It's a disorder of the
electrical system of your heart,

33:56.434 --> 33:58.818
which can cause irregular heartbeats.

33:58.975 --> 34:00.650
You've probably had it your whole life,

34:00.650 --> 34:03.977
though it's only started to manifest
itself now, which is common.

34:04.140 --> 34:06.050
That's why my game's been off.

34:06.624 --> 34:07.801
But now that we know you have it,

34:07.840 --> 34:09.945
it can be easily controlled
with medications.

34:11.592 --> 34:13.783
Tracy, I said it can be easily controlled.

34:13.815 --> 34:15.090
I heard you.

34:15.123 --> 34:16.701
Then why do you look so anxious?

34:16.748 --> 34:19.286
Because there's one thing
you haven't told me yet.

34:20.416 --> 34:22.367
Can I still play tennis?

34:23.177 --> 34:25.395
As if your life depended on it.

34:30.804 --> 34:31.679
Okay.

34:33.851 --> 34:35.643
I know you're worried, but you shouldn't be.

34:35.772 --> 34:37.206
Hank will take care of everything...

34:38.887 --> 34:41.299
So Tracy's gonna be fine.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.297
- Oh, thank God.
- That's great news.

34:43.330 --> 34:45.650
Uh, Divya, would you give
me a moment with Aaron?

34:45.650 --> 34:46.696
Of course.

34:51.230 --> 34:52.931
Are you in love with Tracy?

34:53.138 --> 34:54.529
Am I what?

34:55.482 --> 34:57.576
I told you we ended it last year.

34:57.612 --> 34:58.532
I-I know. I know.

34:58.580 --> 35:00.736
But your symptoms seem to be Tracy-based.

35:00.773 --> 35:02.866
They come on when you're
concerned for her safety

35:02.906 --> 35:04.511
or worried about her leaving.

35:05.401 --> 35:07.072
- "Tracy-based"?
- Mm-hmm.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.824
That's quite a diagnosis.

35:08.858 --> 35:10.197
Did you go to medical school for that?

35:10.234 --> 35:12.417
The nausea at dinner with Keller and Tracy.

35:12.450 --> 35:14.472
You collapsed when you heard
she got into the tournament

35:14.513 --> 35:16.148
and could be leaving the club, and just now

35:16.184 --> 35:18.522
you were having trouble
breathing when she went down.

35:20.681 --> 35:24.066
When Tracy and I dated,
it was pretty serious.

35:24.734 --> 35:26.493
We hung out a lot.

35:28.690 --> 35:31.917
I broke up with her last year during
the tournament to focus on my game.

35:33.626 --> 35:35.185
It crushed her,

35:35.631 --> 35:38.028
and little did I know how
much it crushed me too.

35:39.967 --> 35:41.529
I was so in love with her.

35:43.782 --> 35:47.594
And when she came back here,
I realized that I still am.

35:48.159 --> 35:49.909
I don't want to lose her again.

35:50.577 --> 35:52.450
You don't have a Costa Rica infection.

35:53.227 --> 35:55.182
I think you're suffering from anxiety.

35:55.210 --> 35:56.302
Anxiety?

35:56.672 --> 35:58.928
Anxiety wouldn't make me hyperventilate,

35:58.962 --> 35:59.997
wouldn't make me collapse.

36:00.039 --> 36:01.599
You go to medical school for that?

36:01.599 --> 36:02.958
Huh.

36:04.545 --> 36:06.796
So what do I do?

36:07.381 --> 36:08.368
Well...

36:09.488 --> 36:12.676
I can prescribe you some
antianxiety medications,

36:12.676 --> 36:15.667
or you could just go out
there and talk to her.

36:21.162 --> 36:22.970
Okay. Good luck.

37:17.937 --> 37:19.453
We just feel horrible.

37:19.492 --> 37:22.066
I mean, we had no idea
she was washing dishes.

37:22.106 --> 37:23.376
We just wanted to make sure she was okay.

37:23.414 --> 37:25.349
- We did...
- In through the nose, Evan.

37:26.723 --> 37:28.344
I'm afraid we chased her away.

37:28.391 --> 37:29.519
You tried to help.

37:29.567 --> 37:30.730
As you both know,

37:30.730 --> 37:32.714
it's the journey that matters most...

37:32.714 --> 37:35.179
Not just yours, Emma's too.

37:35.216 --> 37:36.973
She just looked so defensive.

37:37.029 --> 37:39.707
She knew we knew she'd
been pretending to be rich,

37:39.707 --> 37:41.049
so she just took off,

37:41.049 --> 37:43.043
and we don't know where she went.

37:43.075 --> 37:44.698
We don't know where she went.
We don't know if she's okay.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.633
Your concern for her is admirable,

37:46.716 --> 37:48.105
but Emma's not here.

37:48.245 --> 37:49.499
You are.

37:49.540 --> 37:51.617
You came back. Why?

37:51.646 --> 37:54.917
We need to talk about
your journey, not Emma's.

37:55.549 --> 37:57.321
- That's it.
- What's it?

37:57.356 --> 37:58.424
The ferry.

37:58.424 --> 38:00.622
- She's going home.
- Of course.

38:00.651 --> 38:01.460
- Let's go.
- Right.

38:02.201 --> 38:03.186
No, no, wait.

38:03.186 --> 38:05.585
Call Hank and tell him to
look for her at the ferry.

38:05.628 --> 38:08.375
There's one stop I think Emma
needs to make before she takes off.

38:10.101 --> 38:11.693
This isn't a rental shop, dear.

38:11.724 --> 38:12.961
You don't just take what you want

38:13.002 --> 38:14.560
and then return it when you're done.

38:14.603 --> 38:15.886
That's not what I did.

38:15.926 --> 38:18.375
It's exactly what you did, twice.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.103
Please, give me my money back.

38:23.590 --> 38:24.902
Should we call the police?

38:25.169 --> 38:28.367
Mr. and Mrs. Lawson,
how nice to see you both.

38:28.403 --> 38:30.457
Hi, there. Everything okay here?

38:30.457 --> 38:31.757
Everything's fine.

38:31.794 --> 38:33.977
Just a young lady trying to take advantage.

38:33.977 --> 38:35.150
This is Emma.

38:35.298 --> 38:37.252
She happens to be my sister, actually.

38:37.472 --> 38:39.452
I bought these clothes,

38:39.480 --> 38:41.275
and now she won't give me my money back.

38:41.275 --> 38:42.272
Really?

38:42.272 --> 38:44.273
I'm afraid that's not quite the whole truth.

38:44.273 --> 38:45.931
- She wore the items.
- No, I didn't.

38:45.955 --> 38:50.876
Meryl, it seems to me your return
policy is clearly displayed.

38:50.919 --> 38:53.414
- Yes, Mrs. Lawson, but...
- Then give Emma her money back.

38:59.642 --> 39:01.212
Right away, Mrs. Lawson.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.316
Thank you.

39:07.982 --> 39:11.355
Well, she did not like me.

39:12.535 --> 39:13.636
Hold on a second.

39:15.545 --> 39:16.921
What do you expect?

39:17.704 --> 39:20.381
You bought and wore those clothes
knowing you were gonna return them.

39:20.381 --> 39:22.464
Well, yeah, I mean,
technically, that's allowed.

39:22.510 --> 39:23.800
Yeah, but you lied.

39:24.306 --> 39:26.788
You shouldn't do that, Emma.
You shouldn't lie to people...

39:26.820 --> 39:28.833
- Not to that woman in there.
- Or to us.

39:29.508 --> 39:30.331
Yeah.

39:31.344 --> 39:33.881
Look, we should talk.

39:34.109 --> 39:35.096
Sure.

39:35.132 --> 39:36.650
Not here, though, back home.

39:37.308 --> 39:38.617
Okay.

39:48.933 --> 39:50.555
I didn't just come here to meet Eddie.

39:51.521 --> 39:54.667
I came here to show him how
well I've done without him.

39:55.197 --> 39:56.776
I mean, if he doesn't need me,

39:56.798 --> 39:58.471
then I sure as hell don't need him.

39:59.951 --> 40:03.097
But when I saw how you guys live,

40:03.308 --> 40:07.111
I mean, I realized that my real
story wasn't going to impress him.

40:07.317 --> 40:08.624
Wait a second, I'm sorry.

40:08.918 --> 40:10.491
Your real story?

40:10.527 --> 40:11.874
Yeah, what does that mean?

40:12.330 --> 40:14.686
My mom never found an oil baron.

40:17.097 --> 40:20.985
I'm the manager of a diner in St. Louis.

40:21.823 --> 40:23.332
There's no Brampton Academy,

40:23.370 --> 40:26.013
and there is no fancy
adventure in my future.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.628
Well, I mean...

40:28.665 --> 40:31.568
Unless you consider the
bus ride back home fancy.

40:31.615 --> 40:33.018
Why did you make it all up?

40:33.702 --> 40:36.808
Well, I realized that my real
story wasn't gonna impress

40:36.808 --> 40:39.258
anyone in the Hamptons or any of you,

40:40.003 --> 40:42.513
and that's when I bought the nice clothes,

40:42.552 --> 40:45.009
and I had to get the job for cash.

40:45.056 --> 40:47.726
- But you were driving a BMW.
- That's right.

40:48.889 --> 40:51.467
No one is ever nice to the valet.

40:51.752 --> 40:54.467
I slipped him some money to borrow the car.

40:55.666 --> 40:58.756
The last thing I wanted to do was to show
up here like I was asking for something.

41:01.898 --> 41:03.792
I'm sorry I lied to you guys.

41:06.462 --> 41:09.249
Well, for what it's worth, Emma,

41:09.278 --> 41:11.662
I'm more impressed by your real
story than the one you made up.

41:11.809 --> 41:14.067
Emma, you don't ever
have to pretend with us.

41:14.140 --> 41:17.401
You are family, and we want
you to stay now more than ever.

41:17.401 --> 41:18.149
Yeah.

41:18.408 --> 41:21.228
We want to get to know you, the real you.

41:21.266 --> 41:24.138
I mean, I...

41:24.182 --> 41:25.321
You have an amazing family.

41:25.361 --> 41:26.608
I don't want to mess that up.

41:26.608 --> 41:28.951
Okay, what's the matter?

41:29.293 --> 41:31.168
I heard the tone in the voice mail.

41:31.201 --> 41:34.322
I tried to call. I know
when my children need me.

41:35.408 --> 41:37.392
Do you know when I need you?

41:39.234 --> 41:41.591
I'm so sorry. We haven't been introduced.

41:41.622 --> 41:42.840
Eddie R. Lawson.

41:42.880 --> 41:44.730
I'm Hank and Evan's dad.

41:45.591 --> 41:47.635
Why do you look so familiar?

41:51.728 --> 41:53.644
I'm Emma...

41:54.624 --> 41:56.022
Your daughter.

42:00.554 --> 42:01.508
Dad...

42:01.562 --> 42:03.447
Do you remember Meredith?

42:11.577 --> 42:14.966
So you're Meredith's child.

42:15.677 --> 42:17.835
So why don't we just cut to the chase?

42:18.203 --> 42:21.255
What does Meredith want,
and why are you here?
