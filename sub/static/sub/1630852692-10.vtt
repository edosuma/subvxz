00:28.111 --> 00:29.821
It won't end well for you.

00:31.073 --> 00:33.283
Just tell us how to access
the secret

00:33.366 --> 00:35.994
under Whitestone,
and this will all end.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.579
Please.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.289
I told you.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.917
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.962
I do love it when they hold out.

She's unarmed!

02:34.737 --> 02:36.240
[Percy] So was my family.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.659
Percy, she may have
something we can use.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.996
They kept her alive
for a reason.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.331
Um. Mind telling us

02:44.414 --> 02:45.707
who the hell this is?

02:45.790 --> 02:47.084
Dr. Anna Ripley.

Another Briarwood pawn

02:49.545 --> 02:51.588
I'm about to remove
from the board.

[chuckles] And here I thought
you were the intelligent one.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.302
We're both engineers, Percival.

02:57.385 --> 03:00.139
We know the value of knowledge.

You must be curious
as to the information I possess.

[gun cocks]

03:05.936 --> 03:07.354
Not that curious.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.355
- Brother, wait.
- Why should I?!

03:09.439 --> 03:11.191
I've been with the Briarwoods
for years,

03:11.275 --> 03:13.360
and I know next to nothing
about their motives.

with this smoke thing. I mean,

03:37.718 --> 03:39.344
you are legit fucked up.

03:39.427 --> 03:41.055
Not this again.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.805
It's been getting worse.

03:42.889 --> 03:46.060
Pike, eh...
can you divine anything?

03:46.143 --> 03:48.103
If Percy will let me.

But something is
clouding your soul.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.307
We need to get you to a temple.

04:25.391 --> 04:27.725
Really? With rebels
at the gates

04:27.810 --> 04:29.435
and the Briarwoods
in this castle?

04:29.519 --> 04:30.937
Have you all gone mad?

04:31.021 --> 04:32.439
But if something
is wrong with you...

04:32.523 --> 04:35.483
Your concerns are
appreciated, truly.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.319
But we must press forward.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.531
As soon as this is over,
I will sort it out.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.617
[Pike] Will you?

04:45.326 --> 04:47.745

04:56.129 --> 04:57.715
You work for the Briarwoods.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.841
Why would they imprison you?

04:59.925 --> 05:01.884
[chuckles] Would you believe

05:01.968 --> 05:04.430
I had moral objections
to their plans?

05:04.512 --> 05:06.514
- [grunts]
- [all gasp]

05:06.598 --> 05:08.266
It was a simple transaction.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.476
They needed an engineer,
I needed a patron

05:10.560 --> 05:12.437
to fund my experiments.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.398
When my job was complete,

05:14.480 --> 05:16.358
I thought it was time to leave.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.235
They disagreed.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.237
And why am I not
simply shooting you,

05:20.319 --> 05:23.031
heading to the throne room,
and doing the same to them?

05:23.115 --> 05:26.117
Because, Percival,
they aren't there.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.245
Their concerns lie
with the ziggurat.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.040

Oh! The-the zippertwat!

05:34.625 --> 05:36.420

05:36.502 --> 05:38.797
- It does?
- No, not really.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.507
Their ritual, whatever it is,
it'll happen there.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.343
And the ziggurat is not up.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.471
It's down.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.264
Ah, the dark power I sensed

05:48.348 --> 05:50.683
through the Sun Tree's roots.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.562
I think she's telling the truth.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.521
I don't trust a word she says.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.279
Then trust me.

06:07.451 --> 06:10.788
If you let me live,
I can take you there.

you and I would work together.

luckiest person in Whitestone.

the bottom of my list.

and today,

07:32.034 --> 07:33.661
we take it back!

- To the castle!

[clears throat]
Cassandra, was it?

07:47.259 --> 07:50.971
Seeing as how we're
two unattached adults...

07:51.053 --> 07:52.973
No.

[groans]

07:55.433 --> 07:57.769
Interesting company you keep.

07:57.853 --> 08:01.064
I recall you having more digits
last time we saw each other.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.649
Innovation is dangerous.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.569
Especially when you mix
science and magic.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.113
This ziggurat.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.240
- You found it for them?
- [scoffs]

08:11.324 --> 08:13.576
Not just found, restored.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.661
Improved.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.497
At the Briarwoods' request,

08:17.581 --> 08:19.165
I was able
to augment the structure

08:19.249 --> 08:21.125
with a particular mineral.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.793
Residuum.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.422
But to what end is
anyone's guess.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.138
- [grunts]
- What are you...

08:34.597 --> 08:36.600
[grunts]

08:37.893 --> 08:40.354
[all gasp]

08:40.437 --> 08:43.398
Mm, worked even better
than my design.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.359
Perhaps I should take the lead?

08:45.442 --> 08:47.568
[Percy] By all means.

08:47.653 --> 08:50.029
Easier to keep an eye on you.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.418
Mm?

09:03.501 --> 09:05.169
Uh, buddy?

09:05.254 --> 09:08.590
Whoa. I mean, you feel real.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.841
I am, Grog.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.595
I'm just... not entirely here.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.054
Right.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.057
So it worked?

09:17.139 --> 09:19.058
I mean, you said sorry?

09:19.142 --> 09:22.187
Well, I had things
I needed to figure out.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.940
And once I did...

09:25.023 --> 09:27.859
Let's just say
I know who I am now.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.485
Well, duh.

09:29.568 --> 09:31.028
You're my best friend.

09:31.113 --> 09:33.155
Except now you glow in the dark!

09:33.240 --> 09:35.491
[laughs] Ooh!

09:37.119 --> 09:38.787
How are those wounds?

09:38.870 --> 09:40.413
I've survived worse.

09:40.496 --> 09:41.664
Hmm.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.793
I warned you
those vines have thorns.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.879
[Vax] [sighs] Yeah, yeah.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.011
Such a well-constructed weapon.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.431
Do the barrels rotate
by gear or wheel?

09:58.432 --> 10:00.642
Come now, you must be dying

10:00.725 --> 10:03.394
to talk shop
with an intellectual equal.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.647
Your friends seem
pleasant enough, but...

10:05.730 --> 10:08.066
your mind is on another level.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.777
She has a point.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.696
Your mind is unlike any
I've come across.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.322
Thank you, Cassandra.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.950
[Cassandra] [chuckles]
Not a compliment.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.828

you best hope so.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.681

Stand back!

10:41.182 --> 10:43.518

10:43.601 --> 10:45.604
Uh, that's a grave.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.485
[Vex] Where are we?

10:52.568 --> 10:54.071
[Cassandra] Our family tomb.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.114
It holds generations
of de Rolos.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.158
[rumbling]

10:58.240 --> 10:59.784
[gasps]

10:59.868 --> 11:02.328
[grunts] We've got visitors.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.121
[Vex] Wait a second.

11:04.206 --> 11:07.250
Did Lady Briarwood raise
all the dead?

11:08.751 --> 11:10.796
[growling]

11:14.924 --> 11:17.094
Uncle Nathaniel?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.886
[chuckles weakly]

11:18.970 --> 11:20.846
[Keyleth] Hi!

11:20.931 --> 11:22.432
I'm Keyleth,
friends with your nephew.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.350
Oh, God, you smell like shit.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.274
This is wrong.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.818
Oh, I know. Isn't it great?

11:33.902 --> 11:35.236
[grunting]

11:35.320 --> 11:36.654
[exclaims joyfully]

11:48.332 --> 11:50.168
[laughing]

11:51.961 --> 11:54.004
[Keyleth] How long's he gonna
stay like that?

11:54.088 --> 11:56.091
No telling, really.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.596
Drop it, Ripley. Now.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.515
You still think
you can do this without me?

12:06.058 --> 12:11.022
[sighs] Percival, I'm not what
you should be worried about.

12:12.691 --> 12:15.443
I have more than enough worry
to go around.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.403
[exhales]

12:17.486 --> 12:19.822
Fine.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.616
But you'll regret this.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.702
[grunts]

12:38.966 --> 12:41.260
Mind giving this
a shove, big man?

12:41.344 --> 12:43.304
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.514
Could you say that again?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.725
Oh, gods. Oh, Grog.

12:47.808 --> 12:50.854
You are so mighty
and I am so weak.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.190
How ever can little old me

12:53.273 --> 12:55.232
survive without you?

12:55.317 --> 12:58.736
Well, since you asked so nicely.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.654
[grunting]

13:03.283 --> 13:05.326
[Scanlan] Whoa.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.620
[Ripley] Some of my best work.

13:07.703 --> 13:10.916
This far below Whitestone,
it took ages.

13:13.585 --> 13:16.129
- I don't trust her.
- You don't trust anyone.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.215
Well... except you.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.674
Funny way of showing it
sometimes.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.302
[sighs] Oh, gods.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.596
Hey, uh, just to point this out

13:25.679 --> 13:28.767
before we go get ourselves
killed, we do have evidence now.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.309
We could drop this whole thing.

13:30.393 --> 13:31.811
You know, go back
and fight our day in court.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.897
Oh, and abandon
the revolution we caused?

13:33.980 --> 13:37.067
No, whatever the Briarwoods
are planning down there,

13:37.149 --> 13:38.567
we must end it.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.486
Right, right, yeah, yeah.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.404
[scoffs] Dumb suggestion,
Keyleth.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.950
Yeah, I'm really disappointed
in you, Keyleth.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.451
Wait, what? No,
Scanlan's the one who said...

13:47.536 --> 13:49.955
[muttering]

13:54.709 --> 13:56.628
[Keyleth] Okay, uh...

13:56.711 --> 13:58.171
Percy?

13:58.254 --> 13:59.923
Any idea what we're looking at?

14:00.005 --> 14:02.008
It's a drug factory!

14:02.091 --> 14:04.594
We just hit the jackpot.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.721
Anybody have a pipe?

14:06.804 --> 14:09.599
I'm fairly certain that would be
an unpleasant trip.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.308
This is residuum.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.687
The pipes must carry acid

14:13.769 --> 14:15.730
for its chemical refinement
process.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.982
[Vex] Looks like
they're making a lot of it.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.859
[Vax] Why so much?

14:19.942 --> 14:21.820
[gun cocks]

14:21.903 --> 14:23.738
This was Anders' domain.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.990
I only helped them
with the ziggurat.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.409
Uh, what the heck is this for?

14:28.493 --> 14:31.288
[rats squeaking]

14:31.370 --> 14:33.748
[sizzling]

14:42.256 --> 14:44.384
Cassandra!

14:51.265 --> 14:52.767
No.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.440
[panting]

15:03.193 --> 15:04.778
Percy.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.905
Tell your sister
to quit taking the piss

15:06.990 --> 15:08.866
before I forget my manners.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.410
[Percy] Cass,
what are you doing?!

15:12.453 --> 15:14.788
[Sylas] Excellent work, dear.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.169
[growls]

15:20.253 --> 15:21.254
[grunts]

15:21.337 --> 15:23.590
Bit of a slow learner.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.054
[Vex] No!

15:30.138 --> 15:31.514
Brother!

15:31.597 --> 15:33.307
Why are you doing this?

15:33.390 --> 15:35.225
You did this to yourself, Percy.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.895
The day you left me
lying in the snow,

15:37.979 --> 15:40.606
choking on my blood
like a hunted animal.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.360
My brother abandoned me.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.279
[grunts]

15:47.364 --> 15:48.865
I have a new family now.

15:48.947 --> 15:50.866
One that transcends death.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.244
One that will never leave me.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.163
I am a Briarwood.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.919
[sobbing]

16:03.879 --> 16:05.881
You!

16:05.965 --> 16:08.259
I'm just as trapped as you are.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.803
I must say,
I'm quite surprised to see you

16:10.886 --> 16:12.846
out of your cage, Anna.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.808
A delight that you've gone
and gotten yourself recaptured.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.351
Poor Ripley.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.355
Always the unlucky one.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.191
Stop! If you value your lives,

16:23.274 --> 16:25.192
you'll let my brother go!

16:25.275 --> 16:27.821
I'm afraid life is
far more valuable

16:27.903 --> 16:30.115
to you than it is to us.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.701
Don't fret.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.952
We'll take excellent care
of him.

16:35.036 --> 16:37.746
Be a lamb, would you?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.335
[gasps]

16:50.009 --> 16:53.011
- [gasps]
- An acid trap?

16:53.096 --> 16:55.724
Oh, real fucking original!

16:55.807 --> 16:57.433
Vax! Brother!

16:57.517 --> 16:59.394
Wake up! It's me!

16:59.476 --> 17:01.019
Wake up!

17:02.147 --> 17:04.315
Wait! C-Come, come on!

17:04.398 --> 17:05.942
Don't you at least want
to see Grog die?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.317
[Grog] Hmm?

17:10.821 --> 17:12.615
[exhales]

17:16.243 --> 17:18.078
Uh, guys?

17:18.163 --> 17:19.873
There must be a way out of this.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.415
Anyone have a plan?

17:21.499 --> 17:23.542
- Vex?
- Why are you looking at me?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.753
Percy, a little help?

17:26.755 --> 17:28.923
Right, well...

17:29.007 --> 17:31.468
um... try to stop the acid!

17:31.550 --> 17:34.636
Uh... fuck, uh, ooh! Pike!

17:34.721 --> 17:37.222
Can't you just, you know,
pass through walls?

17:37.307 --> 17:39.224
I'm not a ghost, Scanlan.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.977
If I break the connection,
there's a chance

17:41.059 --> 17:42.604
I won't be able to come back.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.397
Then let's get to smashing!

17:45.481 --> 17:47.817
[grunting]

17:49.778 --> 17:53.280
Welp, I'm out of ideas.

17:53.364 --> 17:55.325
The feed pipe.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.618
If we can cut it off,
it might buy us some time.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.329
[Vex] And how do you
propose we do that?

18:12.174 --> 18:13.550
Ah, yes!

18:13.634 --> 18:15.135
- [all cheering]
- Nice!

18:15.220 --> 18:17.763
- [Grog] Now we're talking!
- [Vex] Not bad, Keyleth.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.265
Uh, fam?

18:19.348 --> 18:20.391
Oh, shit.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.438
Oh, not what I was going for.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.648
Your castle has
lousy plumbing, Percy.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.733
All right, new plan.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.568
Stay out of the acid!

18:31.653 --> 18:32.903
[grunts]

18:32.987 --> 18:34.489
Scanlan's Hand!

18:34.572 --> 18:37.157
Come on, pile on!

18:37.241 --> 18:39.326
[grunting]

18:39.410 --> 18:41.412
Percy, get over here!

18:43.122 --> 18:45.791
Aw, great, Percy's broken.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.794
Come here, you limp noodle.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.921
[grunting]

18:50.003 --> 18:52.006
It won't hold for long,
so unless you want

18:52.089 --> 18:55.093
to go swimming, we need
to come up with something fast!

18:55.175 --> 18:57.345
Percy, snap the fuck out of it!

18:58.971 --> 19:01.182
We came here
risking our lives for you.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.393
Be here for us.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.060
What's the point?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.689
She's gone again.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.066
[Vex] Maybe.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.442
But the people in this room,
we're not.

19:12.527 --> 19:15.571
We will never abandon you.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.991
You want your sister back.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.910
And I want my brother.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.162
But if we're to have
a chance of saving them,

19:23.246 --> 19:25.874
you have to save us first.

19:33.256 --> 19:36.049
Right. Scanlan, can you get us

19:36.134 --> 19:37.759
- to the ceiling?
- What? How?

19:37.844 --> 19:39.261
You fuckers are too heavy!

19:39.345 --> 19:41.346
Wait, that's it.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.641
Heavy.

19:43.724 --> 19:47.060
- [grunting rhythmically]
- [playing heavy metal riff]

19:50.647 --> 19:53.108
Ah, the mechanism
that controls the walls...

19:53.192 --> 19:54.861
There!

19:54.943 --> 19:57.154
Oh! Heck yes, Percy!

19:57.238 --> 19:58.865
[grunting]

20:00.407 --> 20:02.451
- Got it!
- [Grog] Pike!

20:03.619 --> 20:05.829
The switches are interconnected.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.833
There appears to be a third
to pull simultaneously.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.542
Yes, exactly.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.753
We need to triangulate
its location.

20:13.755 --> 20:16.548
[grunts] There's no visible
controls on the outer walls.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.718
The drain.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.803
The stopper!

20:20.886 --> 20:22.512
In the acid?

20:22.596 --> 20:24.015
You have to be insane
to go in...

20:24.097 --> 20:25.682
I'm going in!

20:25.767 --> 20:26.768
[grunts]

20:28.853 --> 20:30.688
[gurgling]

20:33.607 --> 20:35.276
[gasps]

20:35.359 --> 20:36.736
Grog, wait!

20:36.818 --> 20:39.572
I'll heal you!

20:48.789 --> 20:50.750
[grunts]

20:56.047 --> 20:58.924
No!

20:59.008 --> 21:00.759
Ready?

21:04.346 --> 21:06.723
[grunting]

21:06.807 --> 21:09.143
Now!

21:17.442 --> 21:18.277
[gasps]

21:18.361 --> 21:20.654
[all grunting]

21:26.451 --> 21:29.204
Good to have you back, Percival.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.458
Since I helped out, don't you
think I earned my freedom?

21:32.541 --> 21:35.211
If you're lucky, you've earned
another hour of life.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.297
- [Pike] There you go.
- [groaning]

21:39.339 --> 21:40.883
You okay, Grog?

21:40.967 --> 21:43.594
[grunts] I don't know.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.847
Is...
is Captain Winky still there?

21:46.931 --> 21:49.851
Uh, still hangin' low, buddies.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.935
Ooh, then I'm good.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.770
Let's go!

21:53.855 --> 21:56.691
Oop, forgot my drawers.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.779
Where does this lead?

22:02.864 --> 22:05.032
The ziggurat.

22:05.115 --> 22:07.285
Cassandra.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.634
The ritual requires
a blood sacrifice.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.472
Now we're spoiled for choice.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.066
♪ ♪

23:08.054 --> 23:10.056
♪ ♪

23:23.111 --> 23:25.070
