02:57.025 --> 03:00.029
'We pray once more
for Ed and Jack Biddle.'

03:01.001 --> 03:04.017
Hear my plea for your
lost lambs, father.

03:04.019 --> 03:05.024
Suffering injustice

03:05.026 --> 03:08.023
at the hands of evil,
unrighteous men.

03:08.025 --> 03:12.013
Give those boys strength, Jesus.

03:12.015 --> 03:14.013
Show them mercy.

03:14.015 --> 03:16.003
'Fill their hearts
with the hope'

'that only you can
give, dear Jesus.'

'All of you! Go on.'

(female #2)

'Go on.'

04:27.017 --> 04:28.024
(Kate)
'Peter.'

04:30.009 --> 04:35.001
'I dreamt that I was lost
in snowstorm.'

04:35.003 --> 04:38.003
'And I couldn't breathe.'

04:40.012 --> 04:43.025
'Somebody pulled me out
to a clear spot.'

04:43.027 --> 04:45.028
Lord, Kate.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.023
'Poor Peter.
I wear you out.'

04:49.025 --> 04:52.017
- No.
- 'Peter?'

(Peter)
'Here, drink this.
It'll help you sleep.'

04:54.020 --> 04:56.003
Peter.

04:59.005 --> 05:01.018
I know what the dream means.

05:02.015 --> 05:04.009
I'm gonna get better.

05:07.003 --> 05:09.003
God was telling me

05:09.005 --> 05:10.024
'he's not gonna let me die.'

05:10.026 --> 05:12.029
Yes, yes.

05:13.001 --> 05:15.023
Yes. Drink this now.

05:15.025 --> 05:16.026
Go on.

05:28.021 --> 05:30.013
Thank you, son.

05:30.015 --> 05:31.028
(male #2)
Here we go..

05:32.000 --> 05:33.011
Move it along, please.

05:33.013 --> 05:34.024
...at the hands of evil,
unrighteous men..

05:34.026 --> 05:36.020
Alright, Mrs..
Move!

05:38.009 --> 05:40.010
Hurry, kids.
Get out of the street.

05:40.012 --> 05:42.013
(female #3)
'Free the Biddles!
Free the Biddles!'

05:42.015 --> 05:44.026
'Free the Biddles!
Free the Biddles!'

05:46.016 --> 05:49.002
[indistinct chattering]

05:54.011 --> 05:57.012
I'm sorry, Jessie.
I asked, and they said no.

05:57.014 --> 05:58.022
I just want to see him.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.001
I know you do. Sorry.

06:02.014 --> 06:05.019
Let's go over there.
Sir, sir?

06:05.021 --> 06:06.024
Excuse me, sir.

06:06.026 --> 06:08.005
- I made this for Ed.
- For you.

06:08.007 --> 06:10.005
No, thanks. I can't.
It's against the rules.

06:10.007 --> 06:12.001
Would you please
give this to Jack?

06:12.003 --> 06:13.018
[indistinct chattering]

06:15.001 --> 06:17.014
- Just for us.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

06:17.016 --> 06:19.019
Please, sir?

06:19.021 --> 06:21.008
(girl #1)
'Good morning, pinhead!'

06:27.002 --> 06:28.006
'Thank you!'

06:28.008 --> 06:30.001
Bloody kids!

(Clarence)
'No, I'll never shoot another!'

06:33.012 --> 06:35.021
(Eddie)
'Clarence Soffel,
you've been so bad!'

06:35.023 --> 06:37.011
(Clarence)
'Please, please.
Please don't kill me!'

06:37.013 --> 06:39.008
I'll take you away
to Murderers' Row

06:39.010 --> 06:42.021
and lock you up
forever and ever.

06:42.023 --> 06:45.011
(Clarence)
I'll never shoot anyone again!
Please!

will see it our way.'

[Clarence screaming]

07:07.013 --> 07:08.023
Hurry! Hurry!

07:15.004 --> 07:18.007
I'm sorry, boys. Really sorry.
We did the best we could.

07:18.009 --> 07:20.027
I mean, yes, you get the two of
us hanged for the one murder.

07:20.029 --> 07:26.011
That's a pretty neat trick.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.017
- Thanks.
- Come on, boys.

07:28.019 --> 07:32.006
Hey, fellas, don't forget
to send us your bill.

07:32.008 --> 07:33.017
[laughing]

07:36.000 --> 07:37.020
[Peter clears throat]

07:37.022 --> 07:40.007
(Peter)
'Margaret, Eddie, Clarence.'

07:40.009 --> 07:41.027
'I understand you were playing
in an area'

07:41.029 --> 07:44.006
where you're not allowed,
and now you're late for school.

07:44.008 --> 07:45.020
Is that right?

07:45.022 --> 07:47.017
Three little criminals.

07:47.019 --> 07:48.029
[chuckling]

07:52.005 --> 07:54.016
Do you children understand
how hard your sister works

07:54.018 --> 07:57.026
to take care of you
and me and your poor mama?

07:57.028 --> 08:00.022
And when you do something
that's disruptive and wrong

08:00.024 --> 08:02.018
'you have to be punished,
don't you?'

08:02.020 --> 08:05.006
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

08:05.008 --> 08:06.021
(Irene)
'Answer papa, Margaret.'

08:07.024 --> 08:09.003
I'm thinking.

08:11.005 --> 08:14.012
Well, I think the sentence
can be suspended

08:14.014 --> 08:15.026
'this time, court is
dismissed.'

08:15.028 --> 08:19.001
Mama! Mama, you're up!
Are you better?

08:19.003 --> 08:20.024
Yes, I'm better.
I'm all better.

08:20.026 --> 08:22.009
Mama, what are you doing
out of bed?

08:22.011 --> 08:23.019
I'm all well.

08:23.021 --> 08:25.023
Daddy suspended us
from our punishment.

08:25.025 --> 08:27.009
Did he?

08:27.011 --> 08:28.029
(Peter)
'Irene, tell Maggie
to fetch the doctor.'

08:29.001 --> 08:30.004
Oh, no. Really, Peter.

08:30.006 --> 08:31.014
He never knew
what was wrong with me.

08:31.016 --> 08:33.000
I don't see what he can do
for me now.

08:33.001 --> 08:34.024
How can anyone be sick in bed
for three months

08:34.025 --> 08:37.001
and suddenly get up one
morning and say she's fine?

08:37.004 --> 08:40.001
- It doesn't make sense.
- Please, Peter.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.014
I don't need to see the doctor.

08:43.015 --> 08:45.004
Well, then everyone better
get off to school then.

08:45.006 --> 08:48.004
Come on, come on,
they're late already.

08:48.006 --> 08:49.022
(Eddie)
Come on, lamebrain.

08:49.024 --> 08:51.017
- Who appointed you warden?
- You Clarence.

08:51.019 --> 08:52.020
You hush up.

08:55.022 --> 08:57.002
(Kate)
Good afternoon.

09:02.007 --> 09:03.017
Good afternoon.

09:09.013 --> 09:10.019
Harold.

09:10.021 --> 09:12.019
It's good to have you back,
Mrs. Soffel.

09:12.021 --> 09:13.020
Would you like a Bible?

09:13.022 --> 09:15.000
(male #4)
'I've been getting sick'

09:15.002 --> 09:17.005
'of all these boys
and their ugly faces.'

09:17.007 --> 09:19.005
It never changes,
does it, George?

09:19.007 --> 09:21.015
No, ma'am,
I suppose not.

09:21.017 --> 09:22.025
(male #5)
'Why don't you come up here'

09:22.027 --> 09:24.006
'and visit with me, cutie?'

09:24.008 --> 09:26.023
- You hush up!
- Good afternoon.

09:28.012 --> 09:31.021
Why, Lenny, I thought
you left us last September.

09:31.023 --> 09:34.006
Mrs. Soffel, they can always
find something to blame

09:34.008 --> 09:36.001
on an honest fellow like me.

09:36.003 --> 09:37.021
But you'll be pleased
to hear I went to church

09:37.023 --> 09:39.007
four times when I was out.

09:39.009 --> 09:41.005
(Kate)
It doesn't look like
it did you much good.

09:41.007 --> 09:43.006
[George scoffs]

09:43.008 --> 09:46.015
I need a quarter from you,
George, for the pool.

09:46.017 --> 09:48.019
You get on with your work.

09:50.019 --> 09:52.000
He gives me the willies.

09:52.002 --> 09:54.002
Betting on when
somebody's gonna hang.

09:56.023 --> 09:58.016
- Mrs. Soffel.
- Hello.

09:58.018 --> 09:59.026
Thanks.

10:02.020 --> 10:04.018
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.002
[metal door clangs]

10:12.017 --> 10:13.025
[papers ripping]

10:16.019 --> 10:19.016
(male #6)
'Why, Charlie, leave 'em be.
They ain't hurting nothing.'

10:19.018 --> 10:20.023
Warden Soffel believes

10:20.025 --> 10:23.010
a man's cell reflects
a man's moral character.

10:23.012 --> 10:26.006
(Ed)
'We haven't got
any moral character, Charlie.'

10:26.008 --> 10:29.006
We're murderers.
Ain't that right, Jackie?

10:29.008 --> 10:32.026
Does your brother always
fight
your battles for you, Jackie?

10:32.028 --> 10:34.001
[grunting]

10:34.003 --> 10:35.025
Hey!

10:36.026 --> 10:38.021
Get in there! Go on!

10:42.009 --> 10:44.016
You're dead.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.004
Oh, I hear it's the other way
around, Eddie.

10:50.019 --> 10:53.021
Stand back from the door
for inspection.

10:54.015 --> 10:57.005
[Jack coughing]

11:02.024 --> 11:04.003
[Charlie groans]

11:04.025 --> 11:07.003
[Kate screams]

11:07.005 --> 11:08.020
- Ed!
- Jesus!

11:08.022 --> 11:10.018
(Jack)
'No!'

11:10.020 --> 11:11.029
'Stop it!'

11:12.001 --> 11:13.000
Stop it!

11:13.002 --> 11:14.009
Get up!

11:14.011 --> 11:16.003
- Mrs. Soffel, you're bleeding!
- No.

11:16.005 --> 11:18.024
- You're hurt.
- No, no. It's his blood.

11:18.026 --> 11:19.025
Easy!

11:19.027 --> 11:21.018
Easy!

11:21.020 --> 11:23.013
(Jack)
'Leave him be, you bastards!'

11:23.015 --> 11:25.014
You'd better give me your arm,
ma'am. You look a little pale.

11:25.016 --> 11:28.000
No. No, thank you,
Mr. Reynolds.

11:32.012 --> 11:34.005
Here, wipe your face.

11:34.007 --> 11:37.002
- Go on, go on. Go on.
- Thank you.

11:37.004 --> 11:38.023
Mrs. Soffel,
Warden Soffel's wife.

11:38.025 --> 11:40.010
Go tell the warden we got a
prisoner who needs cooling off--

11:40.012 --> 11:41.020
(Jack)
'You started it!'

11:41.022 --> 11:43.005
We've got four more cells
down there!

11:43.007 --> 11:45.029
(Ed)
'Never mind, Jack.'

11:46.001 --> 11:49.000
(Charlie)
'A couple of hungry days
will do Eddie's soul good.'

11:55.016 --> 11:59.004
(Kate)
'Where'd you get that scar
on your face, Mr. Biddle?'

11:59.006 --> 12:01.000
When they arrested me
and Jack.

12:01.002 --> 12:02.020
(Kate)
'They shot you?'

12:02.022 --> 12:06.008
No, ma'am, I shot myself.
I meant to kill myself.

12:06.010 --> 12:07.027
'Don't you read the papers?'

12:09.025 --> 12:12.008
Well, I'm very sorry.

12:14.007 --> 12:15.016
What are you sorry for?

12:15.018 --> 12:17.011
Would you like a Bible,
Mr. Biddle?

12:19.021 --> 12:21.004
What are you sorry for?

12:21.006 --> 12:23.017
- 'Cause we're gonna hang?
- 'Yes.'

12:25.004 --> 12:27.015
Don't you think murderers
ought to be hanged?

12:27.017 --> 12:30.003
I don't believe in hanging.
Take it.

12:32.028 --> 12:36.027
- You want a Bible, Jack?
- No. I want a smoke.

12:38.001 --> 12:40.012
No, thank you, ma'am.

12:40.014 --> 12:42.029
We're gonna die,
but we're not that desperate.

12:48.015 --> 12:51.009
Mrs. Soffel, the warden says
to put him in.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.002
Well, Jack, at least
I won't have to listen

12:59.004 --> 13:00.017
to you snore tonight.

13:01.017 --> 13:02.025
That's right.

13:04.025 --> 13:06.004
Mrs. Soffel?

13:08.003 --> 13:11.011
What kind of flower would you
say that is, right there?

13:11.013 --> 13:12.017
I don't know.

13:12.019 --> 13:15.017
Would you say that
that's a violet?

13:15.019 --> 13:17.029
I think it's a violet,
don't you?

13:21.001 --> 13:23.014
- Yes.
- I think so, too.

13:34.015 --> 13:36.009
George said you met
the Biddles today.

13:36.011 --> 13:39.024
- Don't you think Ed's handsome?
- Not especially.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.009
[bell ringing]

13:42.011 --> 13:44.019
'There's the supper bell,
finally.'

14:00.010 --> 14:01.019
[metal clanging]

14:02.022 --> 14:04.001
[crashing]

14:15.020 --> 14:18.007
[laughing]

14:51.021 --> 14:53.005
Margaret.

14:54.021 --> 14:56.010
What is all this?

15:02.003 --> 15:04.015
That's Ed. That's Jack.

15:04.017 --> 15:07.011
And that's Ed's girl,
Jessie.
She's an actress.

15:07.013 --> 15:09.017
This is a very pretty book
that your grandma gave you

15:09.019 --> 15:11.025
and you were meant
to press flowers in it.

15:11.027 --> 15:14.001
I'm making a record
of all the injustice

15:14.003 --> 15:15.012
the Biddles have suffered.

15:15.014 --> 15:16.021
They don't belong in prison.

15:16.023 --> 15:19.021
They do
if they killed somebody.

15:19.023 --> 15:22.015
Mama, Ed and Jack
are innocent.

15:22.017 --> 15:25.019
It was their partner
who shot the grocer in the head.

15:25.021 --> 15:28.010
A jury found them guilty,
sweetheart.

15:28.012 --> 15:30.000
'And after considering
and asking..'

15:30.002 --> 15:32.005
'Are you listening?'

15:32.007 --> 15:33.027
'Are you listening?'

15:33.029 --> 15:36.021
'And asking the Lord
for guidance'

15:36.023 --> 15:38.013
'the judge gave them
their sentence.'

15:38.015 --> 15:41.027
But, mama, the Biddles committed
90 robberies in 90 days

15:41.029 --> 15:44.013
and never hurt one citizen.

15:44.015 --> 15:46.007
Doman's a dope addict.

15:46.009 --> 15:48.018
[gasps]
'That's enough!'

15:48.020 --> 15:50.020
Come on, Margaret.
Go to bed.

15:56.015 --> 15:58.016
It's a wonder you don't have
nightmares, young lady.

15:58.018 --> 15:59.020
Do you know that?

15:59.022 --> 16:02.016
I do.
I dream about the boys.

16:02.018 --> 16:03.026
Mm-hmm. Get into bed.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.025
I'm afraid papa will
have a curse on his head

16:05.027 --> 16:07.000
for hanging them.

16:07.002 --> 16:09.000
Go on, go on, go on.

16:10.025 --> 16:12.002
Let me tell you
one more thing.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.014
No.

16:14.019 --> 16:15.023
No.

16:15.025 --> 16:18.008
I want you to be quiet
and go to sleep.

16:18.010 --> 16:21.003
They had to pick
the grocer's brain off the wall.

16:23.006 --> 16:25.008
[laughs]

16:26.025 --> 16:28.019
You've got one big imagination,
you know

16:28.021 --> 16:31.027
that's going to get you
into a lot of trouble.

16:31.029 --> 16:35.001
Yes, I'm afraid the devil is
winning the battle for my soul.

16:35.003 --> 16:37.008
Then I think
you better say your prayers.

16:40.029 --> 16:42.020
Through the river
and into the fire

16:42.022 --> 16:44.026
little girls go
when they expire..

16:48.021 --> 16:50.023
Father in heaven..

16:50.025 --> 16:52.018
- Father in heaven..
- ...as night draws near..

16:52.020 --> 16:54.028
- ...as night draws near..
- ...I beseech thee to hear..

16:55.000 --> 16:57.023
...I beseech thee to hear
my humble prayer.

16:57.025 --> 17:00.024
Keep me ever from doing wrong,
keep me..

17:00.026 --> 17:03.029
(together)
Keep me safe, keep me strong.

17:04.001 --> 17:06.019
And keep me a Christian
my whole life long.

17:06.021 --> 17:08.020
- Amen.
- Amen.

17:08.021 --> 17:10.023
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

17:10.026 --> 17:13.015
Are you gonna go to sleep?

17:13.017 --> 17:14.026
Alright.

17:24.027 --> 17:27.018
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

17:27.020 --> 17:28.028
Goodnight.

17:36.012 --> 17:38.003
Goodnight, Peter.

17:39.003 --> 17:40.004
Kate.

17:40.006 --> 17:42.020
I was just...wondering

17:42.022 --> 17:45.001
now that you're feeling
better..

17:45.003 --> 17:48.006
...you'll be continuing
to use your own room?

17:48.008 --> 17:49.026
I think I better for now.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.013
It was just a question.

18:02.022 --> 18:05.009
[indistinct chatter]

18:08.023 --> 18:12.017
Eh, left, left, left.

18:12.019 --> 18:14.016
Farther apart, Johnny.

18:14.018 --> 18:16.010
Two in a row?
That what you want to see?

18:16.012 --> 18:19.020
- That what you're asking for?
- 'I'll give you a cigar.'

18:19.022 --> 18:20.027
Watch now, brother.

18:20.029 --> 18:23.007
(Charlie)
'Come on, lads. Push up.'

18:23.009 --> 18:24.023
Stevens!

18:24.025 --> 18:26.024
[laughing]

18:28.008 --> 18:29.015
Six.

18:32.005 --> 18:33.017
(Kate)
'Just take two
out of the cart, Agnes.'

18:33.019 --> 18:35.001
'I think that's all
we'll need for now.'

18:35.003 --> 18:36.028
- 'Alright..'
- Thank you.

18:41.005 --> 18:43.015
How about a blanket, Mr. Biddle?
The cold's getting fierce now.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.010
Thank you, ma'am.

18:51.019 --> 18:52.027
Mr. Biddle?

18:56.015 --> 18:58.024
I'll just, just leave it here,
for you. Ready, Agnes?

18:58.026 --> 19:01.003
Why don't you peddle that
to somebody stupid enough

19:01.005 --> 19:02.023
to believe it?

19:02.025 --> 19:06.003
What did you give it
to me for, anyway?

19:06.005 --> 19:07.018
I would've thought
God's word might have been

19:07.020 --> 19:08.029
some comfort to you,
but I see I was wrong.

19:09.001 --> 19:11.023
(Ed)
'"And behold a pale horse..'

19:11.025 --> 19:15.003
"...and his name
that sat on him was Death.

19:15.005 --> 19:17.004
"And hell followed with him.

19:17.006 --> 19:20.027
'"And they were given power
over the Earth to kill..

19:20.029 --> 19:22.028
'"...with sword,
and with hunger'

19:23.000 --> 19:25.009
'and with death."'

19:25.011 --> 19:27.007
That sounded pretty good, Ed.

19:27.009 --> 19:28.024
Maybe you should've
been a preacher.

19:28.026 --> 19:31.009
Did you mean to put the fear
of God in me, ma'am?

19:31.011 --> 19:34.008
No. No and I wouldn't have
suggested starting

19:34.010 --> 19:35.022
with the Revelation,
I usually recommend

19:35.024 --> 19:37.019
something more soothing
for the prisoners.

19:37.021 --> 19:38.029
(Ed)
'Do you?'

19:40.010 --> 19:41.014
Yes, I do.

19:41.016 --> 19:44.002
'There's a very lovely section
in Luke.'

19:45.012 --> 19:46.029
Will you read it to me?

19:49.004 --> 19:50.011
Yes.

19:51.010 --> 19:52.017
Umm..

19:56.012 --> 19:58.008
'"Blessed are ye
that hunger now'

19:58.010 --> 20:00.028
'"for ye shall be filled.'

20:01.000 --> 20:02.018
'"Blessed are ye
that weep now'

20:02.020 --> 20:04.000
'for ye shall laugh."'

20:05.010 --> 20:07.023
'This is..'

20:07.025 --> 20:09.020
'This is one
of my favorite parts.'

20:09.022 --> 20:11.001
[spits]

20:16.016 --> 20:18.006
'"Blessed are ye..'

20:18.008 --> 20:21.006
"...when men shall hate you..

20:21.008 --> 20:22.018
'"...and when they shall
separate you'

20:22.020 --> 20:25.000
'"from their company..'

20:25.002 --> 20:27.024
'"...and reproach you..'

20:27.026 --> 20:30.002
'...and cast out your name
as evil."'

20:31.017 --> 20:35.011
'Don't people treat you and your
brother like that, Mr. Biddle?'

20:35.013 --> 20:37.020
- Leave me out of it.
- 'Mrs. Soffel?'

20:37.022 --> 20:39.024
'It's nearly my dinner hour.'

20:39.026 --> 20:41.002
(Kate)
'Why don't you run along,
Agnes.'

20:41.004 --> 20:42.021
'I'll be right there.'

20:45.001 --> 20:48.009
'"Rejoice ye in that day,
and leap for joy'

20:48.011 --> 20:51.029
for, behold, your reward
is great in heaven."

20:52.001 --> 20:54.006
(Ed)
'What's my reward?'

20:54.008 --> 20:55.021
Your heavenly reward.

20:55.023 --> 20:57.025
You mean, God makes you
miserable in this life

20:57.027 --> 20:59.011
so he can make you happy
in the next?

20:59.013 --> 21:01.014
- Is that it?
- No. No.

21:01.016 --> 21:04.021
I think it means, I think
it means that when you suffer

21:05.016 --> 21:07.027
don't give up hope.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.018
- Hope to go to heaven?
- 'Yes.'

21:09.020 --> 21:11.015
Can you see me up there,
floating around

21:11.017 --> 21:13.025
on a cloud, playing my harp
for the all saints?

21:13.027 --> 21:15.015
- You wanna go to heaven, Jack?
- I don't know.

21:15.017 --> 21:16.023
You know anybody
who's been there?

21:16.025 --> 21:18.002
[laughing]

21:18.004 --> 21:20.015
(Kate)
'No, I, I picture heaven..'

21:20.017 --> 21:23.018
I picture heaven
as a place of peace.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.002
Death would be peace.

21:25.004 --> 21:27.017
'No, death is nothing.'

21:27.019 --> 21:29.007
Why would God give us
this short life

21:29.009 --> 21:32.017
with all of its troubles and not
give us a better one afterwards?

21:32.019 --> 21:35.020
- ''Cause he doesn't care.'
- God cares.

21:35.022 --> 21:38.006
God cares even for you.

21:38.008 --> 21:40.017
Even for a dirty killer like me?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.010
That isn't what I meant.

21:45.006 --> 21:47.023
[clanging]

21:50.020 --> 21:53.006
Do you think I'm a killer,
Mrs. Soffel?

21:54.014 --> 21:56.001
Are you, Mr. Biddle?

21:57.015 --> 21:58.024
Ed.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.029
Are you a killer?

22:03.020 --> 22:05.018
In my heart..

22:05.020 --> 22:07.023
...I am.

22:07.025 --> 22:10.011
'I want nothing more
than to send the filthy liar'

22:10.013 --> 22:13.007
'that put us in here,
to his heaven.'

22:13.009 --> 22:15.027
So I suppose
I am a murderer..

22:17.016 --> 22:19.018
...in my heart.

22:19.020 --> 22:21.014
'Ain't l, Kate?'

22:24.019 --> 22:28.015
If you truly want
to commit murder...then, yes..

22:29.025 --> 22:31.020
'...I think you are a murderer
in your heart.'

22:31.022 --> 22:33.019
Then I guess
I'm not worth saving.

22:35.029 --> 22:37.014
'Mrs. Soffel?'

22:40.002 --> 22:41.022
I'm not.

22:43.014 --> 22:45.016
I'm not, I'm not a murderer.

22:56.001 --> 22:58.005
[instrumental music]

23:01.027 --> 23:03.006
Quiet!

23:09.027 --> 23:12.007
So they come up here
to put out the fire.

23:14.017 --> 23:18.000
Then we grab them,
and we get their keys.

23:21.006 --> 23:22.022
What if..

23:24.006 --> 23:26.022
What if they don't come, huh?

23:26.024 --> 23:29.006
I mean, what if they
just let us burn?

23:29.008 --> 23:30.017
What?

23:35.017 --> 23:37.028
What are you writing now,
our wills?

23:38.028 --> 23:40.007
Six.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.029
[door locking]

23:49.014 --> 23:51.016
[humming]

24:07.025 --> 24:09.004
Jack?

24:11.028 --> 24:13.005
'Jack?'

24:14.019 --> 24:15.027
What?

24:16.024 --> 24:19.010
'Where would you be now..'

24:19.012 --> 24:21.002
'...if you hadn't met up
with me and Walter?'

24:21.004 --> 24:23.028
Oh, go to sleep.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.010
'I told them you were
innocent.'

24:26.012 --> 24:27.023
'And they believed Walter.'

24:31.029 --> 24:33.018
'Didn't I try?'

24:33.020 --> 24:35.022
Yeah, I know you did.

24:35.024 --> 24:37.022
I can't die until
I make it up to you.

24:37.024 --> 24:39.027
Stop talking about dying!

24:39.029 --> 24:42.006
You're always talking like if..

24:43.028 --> 24:45.014
Just go to sleep.

24:46.020 --> 24:49.018
'I'm not gonna
let 'em hang you.'

24:49.020 --> 24:51.006
'Believe me?'

24:53.000 --> 24:54.023
'Little brother?'

24:56.000 --> 24:58.025
- Ed.
- Well, do you believe me, Jack?

25:01.025 --> 25:03.020
Sure.

25:03.022 --> 25:05.025
Sure, I believe you.

25:09.024 --> 25:11.025
[bells ringing]

25:15.016 --> 25:18.010
- Mama?
- 'What is it, Irene?'

25:18.012 --> 25:20.008
You left the heater
burning in the parlor.

25:20.010 --> 25:22.003
I-I turned it down.

25:22.005 --> 25:23.017
Thank you.

25:24.016 --> 25:26.002
Did you just get home?

25:26.004 --> 25:28.011
(Irene)
'Billy walked me
from fellowship meeting.'

25:31.020 --> 25:32.018
Goodnight.

25:32.020 --> 25:33.019
'Um, has Billy heard'

25:33.021 --> 25:35.003
'from his school?'

25:35.005 --> 25:37.028
Well, no, not yet.
But he's bound to get in.

25:39.010 --> 25:42.005
It's turning into quite a
romance between the two of you.

25:42.007 --> 25:44.010
It's not a <i>romance,</i><i>mama.</i>

25:46.002 --> 25:48.016
I plan to marry Billy.

25:48.018 --> 25:52.008
Well, we all have a lot
of time to think about that.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.020
He's giving me an engagement
ring for Christmas.

25:54.022 --> 25:56.006
- 'Irene.'
- Papa knows.

25:56.008 --> 25:59.004
Irene, you're barely 16.

25:59.006 --> 26:01.018
'And you were 17
when you married papa.'

26:08.007 --> 26:10.026
Goodnight, mama.

26:10.028 --> 26:13.029
You shouldn't sit by
the window, you'll catch cold.

26:21.008 --> 26:23.026
My goodness, Maggie, I think
it's nearly frozen stiff.

26:23.028 --> 26:25.029
'I know, but it smells musty.
Lordy be.'

26:26.001 --> 26:27.018
Let's take it indoors.

26:28.009 --> 26:30.012
[groans]

26:30.014 --> 26:32.021
- Hope I didn't startle you.
- 'No.'

26:38.024 --> 26:40.016
That's a pretty dress
you got on.

26:40.018 --> 26:42.007
(male #7)
'Back, Mr. Biddle!'

26:42.009 --> 26:44.007
You'll come and read
to me again, won't you?

26:44.009 --> 26:47.000
I come to the prison
every Tuesday and Thursday.

26:49.022 --> 26:50.025
Maggie, the rug beater.

26:52.017 --> 26:55.000
Maggie.

26:55.002 --> 26:58.006
(male #8)
'"You may ask why,
in spite of all hope'

26:58.008 --> 27:00.015
'"do we maintain our
innocence?'

27:00.017 --> 27:03.023
"Every intelligent mother
in Pittsburgh knows the reason.

27:03.025 --> 27:06.023
Because it is true.
We would not--"

27:06.025 --> 27:08.015
(Kate)
'Job's friends are arguing'

27:08.017 --> 27:10.013
that if God has made
Job suffer so much

27:10.015 --> 27:12.011
he must be guilty
of some great sin

27:12.013 --> 27:14.025
because God doesn't
punish the innocent.

27:14.027 --> 27:18.024
God punishes the innocent
all the time. Why is that, Kate?

27:18.026 --> 27:21.014
- God means to test our love.
- By torturing us?

27:21.016 --> 27:23.018
You don't have to tell me
that innocent people suffer.

27:23.020 --> 27:25.003
I've been walking through this
prison for quite a few years--

27:25.005 --> 27:26.028
- Oh, so you know all about it.
- I know enough.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.018
You don't know
what it means to be in here.

27:31.009 --> 27:33.015
'So don't pretend that you do.'

27:37.006 --> 27:41.009
At any rate, nobody is
completely innocent.

27:42.028 --> 27:45.018
'We all sin.'

27:45.020 --> 27:49.010
God punishes you for
your sins, doesn't he, Kate?

27:51.015 --> 27:52.013
I think you suffer.

27:52.015 --> 27:53.022
'I don't come here to discuss'

'...taking us out to hang.'

28:10.002 --> 28:12.006
'And they take Jack up first..'

28:13.019 --> 28:15.024
'...so I have to watch.'

28:20.019 --> 28:22.026
That was a very good
letter you wrote.

28:24.008 --> 28:26.010
'Ed?'

28:28.013 --> 28:30.022
Maybe you'll hear
from the governor soon.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.006
You'll make a prayer?

28:44.007 --> 28:45.018
[women screaming]

28:45.020 --> 28:46.024
- 'Shall we do this again?'
- 'Do you like it?'

28:46.026 --> 28:50.012
One, two, three, whoo!

28:51.012 --> 28:55.006
- One, two and..
- Three!

28:55.008 --> 28:57.022
- 'What happened, mama?'
- 'I don't know.'

29:00.016 --> 29:02.016
Come on, everybody,
let's go around.

29:02.018 --> 29:04.014
Clarence, stop that.

29:04.016 --> 29:08.001
Please, come on.
Margaret, come on.

29:08.003 --> 29:09.017
Let's hurry. Come on.

29:09.019 --> 29:12.022
[indistinct shouting]

'Good news, boys.'

31:01.004 --> 31:02.023
(Kate)
'You wrote this?'

31:02.025 --> 31:04.018
(Ed)
'That's right.'

31:04.020 --> 31:07.005
- Would you read it to me?
- 'Sure.'

31:14.023 --> 31:16.027
Don't laugh.

Why would you write
that for me?

32:04.014 --> 32:06.021
What makes you think I did?

32:08.013 --> 32:12.012
Take it. In exchange
for what you gave to me.

32:15.013 --> 32:18.018
A man at the gazette gets
50 cents for one of those.

lawyers do now, Ed?'

'They're through with us.'

- Sorry.
- 'What for?'

32:32.013 --> 32:33.023
(Kate)
I think I should go now.

32:33.025 --> 32:35.017
God didn't answer
your prayer, did he, Kate?

32:35.019 --> 32:37.012
- My prayer?
- Well, didn't you pray for us?

32:37.014 --> 32:38.012
Yes.

32:38.014 --> 32:39.012
Well, then tell me

32:39.014 --> 32:40.025
why does God want us
to die, Kate?

32:40.027 --> 32:42.025
- Tell me the reason why.
- I can't do that.

32:42.027 --> 32:45.002
Me and Jack, we're innocent.
We're innocent as snow.

32:45.004 --> 32:46.018
- You know that.
- How can I know that?

32:46.020 --> 32:48.018
Well because you know me
and I'm telling you, that's why.

32:48.020 --> 32:51.028
- No! I have to go.
- You nearly had me saved.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.029
- Let go of me, Ed!
- What are you doing?

32:54.001 --> 32:55.011
- 'Let go!'
- 'What do you want from me?'

32:55.013 --> 32:57.004
'What do you come
over here for?'

32:57.006 --> 32:58.017
(Kate)
'I'll call the guard
if you don't let go of me!'

32:58.019 --> 33:01.007
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

33:01.009 --> 33:02.026
Press there!

33:02.028 --> 33:04.023
There, you feel
how strong my neck is?

33:04.025 --> 33:06.013
'Me and Jack, we aim
to break out of here.'

33:06.015 --> 33:07.028
Damn you, Ed! You're crazy.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.029
Are you gonna tell on us?
Are you gonna tell on us?

33:10.001 --> 33:12.003
- Oh, God.
- God? God won't hear you.

33:12.005 --> 33:14.015
You're not in church now.

33:22.023 --> 33:24.019
I'm so-I'm sorry.

33:24.021 --> 33:26.014
No.

33:26.016 --> 33:29.002
You're our only friend
and I've hurt you.

No.

Guard?

34:07.000 --> 34:08.013
Oh, dear father,
please forgive me.

34:08.014 --> 34:11.001
Forgive me for being
such a terrible sinner.

34:11.003 --> 34:13.000
I'm so ashamed, dear father.

34:13.002 --> 34:14.014
Please help and guide me.

34:14.016 --> 34:16.021
Give me the strength
to overcome these thoughts.

Oh, God, I know I'm weak.
Forgive me for..

34:30.018 --> 34:32.014
- 'Maggie.'
- Ma'am.

34:32.016 --> 34:34.011
- 'Mr. Kelly.'
- Good morning, ma'am.

Good morning.

She ain't been to see you
for five days, has she?

34:51.016 --> 34:53.022
(Ed)
She won't tell on us,
I promise.

35:00.012 --> 35:02.016
What do you think you're doing?

35:02.018 --> 35:05.001
What..

35:05.003 --> 35:07.016
What do you think you're doing?

35:07.018 --> 35:11.003
"My husband and I are dedicated
to the reform of criminals.

35:11.005 --> 35:15.000
"But capital punishment does
not allow reform or mercy

35:15.002 --> 35:18.011
and no chance to right
a miscarriage of justice."

35:18.013 --> 35:21.016
'My God, Kate! The governor?'

35:21.018 --> 35:24.008
"I join other Christian men
and women in this great city

35:29.028 --> 35:31.003
Have you lost your senses?

35:31.005 --> 35:32.020
You didn't write it.

35:32.022 --> 35:34.022
I did. I signed it.

Quite a few people
have written, Peter.

County Prison!'

'Do you need
to see the doctor?'

35:42.029 --> 35:43.029
No!

35:44.001 --> 35:45.029
Because that's how
you're acting!

35:48.029 --> 35:51.008
Do you want me to lose my job?

35:53.008 --> 35:55.011
- 'Do you?'
- No.

36:00.018 --> 36:03.018
Maybe you need a rest.

36:03.020 --> 36:05.009
Perhaps mother
could come to visit.

36:05.011 --> 36:07.008
Or you could go to her

36:07.010 --> 36:09.016
or you could go
to your sister's.

36:11.001 --> 36:12.009
Peter.

Peter.

'Kate, if you won't go'

the prisoners--

Please, dear, not now!

You don't seem to be able to

36:33.021 --> 36:34.029
separate your duties
from your sympathies--

36:35.001 --> 36:37.004
It's not sympathy!
I think it's wrong!

36:37.006 --> 36:39.016
That is not for you to decide!

36:43.023 --> 36:46.004
Alright. Alright.

- Hush, don't talk. Don't talk.

40:12.029 --> 40:15.009
I thought you abandoned us.

You should've let me die.

I won't. I won't.

You trust me?

40:42.024 --> 40:45.010
How's she gonna help us?

40:45.012 --> 40:47.020
God will provide a way.

And if anyone asks,
I was out, that's all.

41:08.024 --> 41:10.024
I thought you were going
to Elsie's this morning.

41:12.013 --> 41:14.002
It seems to me
if we're going to hang people

41:14.004 --> 41:17.012
we can at least give God an
opportunity to save their souls.

41:17.014 --> 41:20.008
I quite agree with you. That's
why we have a prison chaplain.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.009
Go home, Kate.

41:23.020 --> 41:25.004
Mr. McNeil..

41:35.023 --> 41:38.011
All I did was read
to a few poor desperate men

41:38.013 --> 41:40.019
and save your prison
from burning down.

41:40.021 --> 41:42.025
'Is that so unreasonable?'

41:44.015 --> 41:46.013
Alright.

41:46.015 --> 41:49.022
But Mr. Biddle will have to
remain in solitary for a while.

[knocking on door]

01:02:21.023 --> 01:02:24.019
Jessie, aren't you coming
to work today?

01:02:24.021 --> 01:02:28.001
No, I'm not coming in today.
Just go ahead without me.

01:02:28.003 --> 01:02:30.003
'Alright,
we'll see you tomorrow.'

01:02:45.007 --> 01:02:48.010
I could use a map of some kind
to plan out where we're going.

01:02:48.012 --> 01:02:50.017
We're in good shape.
Don't you worry.

01:02:52.028 --> 01:02:54.021
How's she gonna travel with you?

01:02:54.023 --> 01:02:57.015
Look at her. Look at her shoes.

01:02:57.017 --> 01:02:59.012
'She's just gonna
hold you back.'

01:02:59.014 --> 01:03:01.007
She's right, Ed.

01:03:01.009 --> 01:03:03.022
Did we break out of prison
just to get caught?

01:03:03.024 --> 01:03:05.024
(Ed)
'Lost your faith in me, Jack?'

01:03:07.018 --> 01:03:09.027
- No.
- 'Cause that's how it sounds.

01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:12.028
(Jessie)
'Jack, you ought to go out on
your own and save yourself.'

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.016
What's the use
of getting killed over her--

01:03:14.018 --> 01:03:16.002
Shut up, Jessie!

01:03:21.013 --> 01:03:24.014
Thank you, sir.
We'll pay you back if we
can.

01:03:24.016 --> 01:03:26.003
(Mr. Bodyne)
'I am proud to do it.'

01:03:26.005 --> 01:03:29.006
'I wish I could help you
gentlemen out some more.'

01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:35.026
[speaking in foreign language]

01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:38.014
I tried to see you in prison
and they wouldn't let me.

01:03:39.011 --> 01:03:41.015
I would have done anything.

01:03:44.025 --> 01:03:46.018
I'm sorry, Jess.

01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:49.014
Put these on.

01:03:49.016 --> 01:03:51.023
Maybe you should abandon me.

01:03:51.025 --> 01:03:53.023
What?

01:03:53.025 --> 01:03:55.017
Maybe you should abandon me.

01:03:55.019 --> 01:03:58.012
The point was to get you free.
You and Jack.

01:03:58.014 --> 01:04:00.017
You wanna go back?

01:04:00.019 --> 01:04:02.000
I don't know.

01:04:02.002 --> 01:04:04.017
Right about now my children
are gonna know that I'm gone.

01:04:04.019 --> 01:04:06.009
If you want to go back,
I'll take you back.

01:04:06.011 --> 01:04:07.020
- Whatever you want.
- Jessie is right.

01:04:07.022 --> 01:04:09.024
How can you travel with me?
I'm so stupid.

01:04:09.026 --> 01:04:12.008
Why'd you come with us
if you don't know?

01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:13.029
(Jessie)
'Look at her.
You're gonna go with her?'

01:04:14.001 --> 01:04:16.023
Look at what she's done.
You know what she's done.

01:04:16.025 --> 01:04:19.025
- No, I want my babies.
- Ed, let her go.

01:04:19.027 --> 01:04:22.002
- Let me out!
- Babies? You want your babies?

01:04:22.004 --> 01:04:25.012
Shut up.
Will you shut up? God.

01:04:25.014 --> 01:04:27.000
I'm sorry.

01:04:28.006 --> 01:04:30.009
- I'm so sorry.
- God!

01:04:32.027 --> 01:04:34.004
Are we going or ain't we?

01:04:34.006 --> 01:04:36.010
[indistinct chatter]

01:04:44.021 --> 01:04:46.000

was it, George?'

01:04:53.025 --> 01:04:55.023
'Maybe 15, 20 times?'

01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:57.005
'And I don't understand it.'

01:04:57.007 --> 01:04:59.023
No, sir, I don't, I don't,
I can imagine..

01:05:04.021 --> 01:05:07.010
Buck! Buck!
The Biddles can't stay caught.

01:05:07.012 --> 01:05:09.016
Looks like you're
going after them a second time.

01:05:09.018 --> 01:05:11.010
It'll be the last time,
believe me.

01:05:11.012 --> 01:05:13.016

- What?
- Push out, away from the train.

Well, happy New Year!

Hey, Jack, would you care
to kiss the bride?

Jack!

01:09:31.015 --> 01:09:32.018
For Christ's sake,
why don't you just go tell

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:35.019
the whole countryside
we're here?

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.029
Read this.

01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:40.020
They're paying $5000
to the man who kills us.

01:09:43.001 --> 01:09:46.015
We just won't let anyone collect
that reward, will we, Ed?

Oh!

01:10:07.007 --> 01:10:08.015
Oh.

We've only been on the road
a couple of hours.

I saw a coal bin
out the back.

01:10:30.011 --> 01:10:32.016
Think you could get some
coal?

Jack, you listening to me?

01:10:42.013 --> 01:10:44.022

Don't you think
you better take that off?

I've worn it 18 years.

01:11:10.018 --> 01:11:12.009

from Perrysville, huh?

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.005
Yes, sir.
I borrowed a horse.

01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:28.019
You know who I am?

01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:31.013
Biddle.

01:17:31.015 --> 01:17:32.028
You tell anyone you saw us?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.018
- No, sir. Not a soul.
- Sure?

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:36.025
Yes, sir.
The Pittsburgh police, they..

01:17:43.019 --> 01:17:44.026
God!

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.006
You can't ever beat it, can you?

01:18:02.006 --> 01:18:03.007
'What?'

01:18:05.015 --> 01:18:08.012
Nothing. I'm sorry.

01:18:08.014 --> 01:18:11.020
- It's alright.
- You got a smoke?

01:18:20.014 --> 01:18:22.012
Mind if I take one
for my brother?

01:18:22.014 --> 01:18:25.017
- 'No.'
- Thank you.

01:18:29.003 --> 01:18:31.006
You wanted to catch us?
For the money?

01:18:32.022 --> 01:18:36.003
Well, money, and to be the man
who got the Biddles.

01:18:41.013 --> 01:18:44.000
Look..

01:18:44.002 --> 01:18:45.024
...I'm gonna knock you out.

01:18:45.026 --> 01:18:48.019
'But don't make any noise
like you're hurt or nothing.'

01:18:48.021 --> 01:18:50.020
'Don't make a sound,
do you understand?'

01:18:50.022 --> 01:18:52.025
- Yes, sir.
- Alright.

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:55.011
Now don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

01:19:00.007 --> 01:19:02.007
- You out?
- Almost.

01:19:03.016 --> 01:19:05.018
Hang on, I'll try again.

01:19:33.005 --> 01:19:34.007
We're safe.

01:19:34.009 --> 01:19:36.021
He didn't tell anybody
he saw us.

01:19:36.023 --> 01:19:37.027
Let's go.

01:19:38.028 --> 01:19:40.003
(Jack)
Giddyup there!

01:19:40.005 --> 01:19:43.008
[instrumental music]

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:54.001
Bless and keep these men,
Father, in the righteousness

01:19:54.003 --> 01:19:55.027
of their mission to hunt
down
the killers of innocent
men--

01:19:55.029 --> 01:19:58.012
(Sheriff Hoon)
Amen, reverend! That's enough.

01:19:58.014 --> 01:20:00.019
Get your guns and ammunition,
men!

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.027
- Sheriff Hoon!
- Aah, what do these women want?

01:20:05.029 --> 01:20:07.003
They want to ride
with the posse

01:20:07.005 --> 01:20:08.016
to make sure no one hurts
the Biddles.

01:20:08.018 --> 01:20:11.024
You get out of here!
Get back home where you belong!

01:20:15.009 --> 01:20:18.013
[instrumental music]

01:20:54.004 --> 01:20:55.028
(Jack)
'Pardon me, sir.'

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.003
Oh, hello there. You lost?

01:20:58.005 --> 01:21:01.003
Oh, no, sir. I'm traveling with
my wife and my brother here.

01:21:01.005 --> 01:21:04.010
And, uh, if you could spare us
some blankets or some food

01:21:04.012 --> 01:21:06.015
'I'll buy 'em from you.'

01:21:11.011 --> 01:21:14.018
You better get that woman
in the house right away.

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:16.003
'Yes, sir.'

01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:23.008
(Mrs. Stevenson)
'You've got no business
taking your wife out'

01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:24.020
on a day like today.

01:21:24.022 --> 01:21:28.005
Well, we got relatives
expecting us up north now.

01:21:28.007 --> 01:21:29.028
'Got an uncle in Erie.
He's awful sick.'

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.029
- 'Erie?'
- 'Yes, sir.'

01:21:32.001 --> 01:21:34.019
(Mr. Stevenson)
'You've got a good piece of
travelling to get to Erie.'

01:21:34.021 --> 01:21:36.000
About how far, sir?

01:21:36.002 --> 01:21:38.001
Well, we're due west of Butler.

01:21:38.003 --> 01:21:42.022
And I'd say it's 100 miles
from Butler to Erie.

01:21:43.017 --> 01:21:45.011
Here she comes now!

01:21:45.013 --> 01:21:47.018
- How you feeling?
- 'Better.'

01:21:49.013 --> 01:21:52.020
Uh, it's beautiful here,
isn't it?

01:21:52.022 --> 01:21:55.001
'But maybe we should hurry,
Ed.'

01:21:55.003 --> 01:21:56.016
There's no rush.

01:21:56.018 --> 01:21:58.024
(Mrs. Stevenson)
'That dress fits, don't it?'

01:21:58.026 --> 01:22:01.011
- 'You better keep it.'
- Oh, no. I couldn't, really.

01:22:01.013 --> 01:22:03.027
'It belonged
to my oldest girl Charlotte'

01:22:03.029 --> 01:22:05.001
when she was young.

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:06.016
Now she's had five babies

01:22:06.018 --> 01:22:08.027
and she's big as a barn.

01:22:08.029 --> 01:22:10.012
Keep it.

01:22:10.014 --> 01:22:14.011
'And you're welcome to stay
as long as you're able.'

01:22:14.013 --> 01:22:17.002
I, uh, put a fire
in the back bedroom upstairs.

01:22:17.004 --> 01:22:19.021
You can go up there
and lie down.

01:22:19.023 --> 01:22:21.028
'Have a rest.'

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.003
It's up to my brother.

01:22:29.005 --> 01:22:31.007
Well, I suppose
we all could use a rest.

01:22:31.009 --> 01:22:33.028
- Good!
- Thank you very much.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.010
You're welcome, dear.

01:22:35.012 --> 01:22:36.016
Thank you.

01:22:36.018 --> 01:22:38.004
Thank you, John.

01:22:41.005 --> 01:22:44.005
Ooh, uh, would you like
to read the paper?

01:22:44.007 --> 01:22:48.012
Mr. Stevenson don't seem
to read no more.

01:22:48.014 --> 01:22:51.026
Our grandnephew, Harry,
reads to him sometimes.

01:22:51.028 --> 01:22:53.028
So you ain't read the news
the last couple of days?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.008
(Mrs. Stevenson)
'No. Harry ain't been over.'

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.027
- Oh, I'll read it to you.
- 'Would you?'

01:22:59.029 --> 01:23:01.010
- Yeah.
- 'Oh, thanks!'

01:23:02.018 --> 01:23:05.009
(Kate)
'How late is it?'

01:23:05.011 --> 01:23:07.016
I don't know the time.

01:23:07.018 --> 01:23:09.017
'Past noon?'

01:23:09.019 --> 01:23:11.005
Possibly.

01:23:13.009 --> 01:23:16.004
You know one thing I never did?

01:23:16.006 --> 01:23:18.011
- That is smoke a pipe.
- 'Me neither.'

01:23:20.011 --> 01:23:22.008
Maybe if I would had
some kind of regular life

01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:24.002
I'd have smoked one.

01:23:24.004 --> 01:23:26.009
- How does it look?
- Fine.

01:23:29.001 --> 01:23:32.007
Well, maybe I'll smoke one
when we get our farm, huh?

01:23:35.022 --> 01:23:37.023
Come keep me warm, Ed.

01:23:37.025 --> 01:23:40.001
It's like
the snow's inside my skin.

01:23:49.004 --> 01:23:50.013
You know something
I'd tell my children

01:23:50.015 --> 01:23:52.025
if they ever felt scared?

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:54.017
- I am not scared.
- No, I know.

01:23:54.019 --> 01:23:56.009
Of course you're not.

01:23:56.011 --> 01:23:59.020
What would you tell your kids?
Mm? Something sweet, I bet.

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:04.011
I'd say..

01:24:04.013 --> 01:24:07.004
[whispering]
Do you wanna hear it?

01:24:07.006 --> 01:24:10.014
I'd say, "Look up at the
sky..

01:24:10.016 --> 01:24:14.011
"...day or night, 'cause
in the sky you can see the sun.

01:24:15.027 --> 01:24:19.016
"And at night, you can see
the moon and the stars.

01:24:20.015 --> 01:24:22.018
"And these are God's eyes..

01:24:23.026 --> 01:24:27.003
"...proof that
he's always above you.

01:24:27.005 --> 01:24:30.023
Watching over you,
protecting you."

01:24:34.013 --> 01:24:37.026
- And they'd believe that?
- I did.

01:24:39.013 --> 01:24:42.006
I suppose God won't protect
me
anymore, will he, Ed?

01:24:44.003 --> 01:24:45.005
'Cause of me?

01:24:45.007 --> 01:24:46.024
No.

01:24:46.026 --> 01:24:48.017
'Cause of me.

01:24:50.021 --> 01:24:52.007
We'll protect each other,
alright?

01:24:52.009 --> 01:24:53.018
Alright.

01:24:57.023 --> 01:24:59.027
Put your hands on me, Ed.

01:25:00.029 --> 01:25:02.021
I'm so cold.

01:25:04.007 --> 01:25:05.022
...Ed.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.013
Make my heart warm.

01:25:08.015 --> 01:25:11.018
[instrumental music]

01:25:38.015 --> 01:25:40.019
[music continues]

01:25:51.003 --> 01:25:54.005
[indistinct chatter]

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.017
[indistinct]

01:25:56.019 --> 01:25:58.022
(male #12)
'I didn't see anybody
I didn't know only.'

01:25:58.024 --> 01:26:00.023
You generally notice
when people come by the store?

01:26:00.025 --> 01:26:02.002
'I certainly do.'

01:26:02.004 --> 01:26:03.021
We're looking for two men
and a woman.

01:26:03.023 --> 01:26:05.016
The two men in their mid
20s,
and the woman, 35--

01:26:05.018 --> 01:26:08.012
(male #12)
'Oh-oh-oh, now-now-now,
wait-wait a minute now.'

01:26:08.014 --> 01:26:10.017
'I think I did see them.'

01:26:10.019 --> 01:26:12.029
- 'When was this?'
- 'Oh-oh, earlier this
morning.'

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:15.020
- 'Driving a sled?'
- 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, they was.'

01:26:15.022 --> 01:26:17.015
(Buck)
'Could you tell
how old they were?'

01:26:17.017 --> 01:26:19.014
(male #12)
'Well, the fellows
was all bundled up.'

01:26:19.016 --> 01:26:22.007
'Pretty hard to tell.
She must've been, oh..'

01:26:22.009 --> 01:26:24.012
'...oh, 30, 35 maybe.'

01:26:24.014 --> 01:26:27.017
- 'Driving two horses?'
- 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cutters.'

01:26:27.019 --> 01:26:29.021
(Buck)
'Did you see which direction
they were going?'

01:26:31.012 --> 01:26:34.015
[instrumental music]

01:27:02.025 --> 01:27:04.027
[music continues]

01:27:33.018 --> 01:27:35.002
Kate?

01:27:39.028 --> 01:27:42.011
All those things
they said I did.

01:27:42.013 --> 01:27:43.028
(Kate)
'What?'

01:27:45.004 --> 01:27:48.000
- Mu.. The murder.
- 'Ssh-ssh..'

01:27:48.002 --> 01:27:49.021
What they're gonna hang me
and Jack for.

01:27:49.023 --> 01:27:51.026
'No, Ed, don't talk.'

01:27:54.024 --> 01:27:56.008
Kate?

01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:00.025
How do you prove
you love someone?

01:28:03.005 --> 01:28:04.018
Prove it?

01:28:09.002 --> 01:28:12.022
If there was some way that
they could get you away from me.

01:28:12.024 --> 01:28:14.028
- Uh..
- If they get us?

01:28:16.003 --> 01:28:18.005
- Yeah.
- Will they?

01:28:20.009 --> 01:28:22.015
There's one thing
that you have to know.

01:28:26.021 --> 01:28:27.028
[scoffs]

01:28:29.001 --> 01:28:31.005
Jack never killed anybody.

01:28:37.005 --> 01:28:39.008
That's why I have to die.

01:28:52.015 --> 01:28:54.026
God abandoned us.
You said that.

01:28:57.006 --> 01:28:58.008
Yes.

01:29:01.001 --> 01:29:04.007
So if you'll forgive me..

01:29:04.009 --> 01:29:06.025
...it'll be alright.

01:29:06.027 --> 01:29:08.013
Ed.

01:29:08.015 --> 01:29:10.016
I forgive you, Ed.

01:29:15.022 --> 01:29:18.023
Don't you let them
take me alive, Ed.

01:29:18.025 --> 01:29:20.024
Promise me.

01:29:20.026 --> 01:29:22.022
Promise me, Ed.

01:29:24.021 --> 01:29:25.020
I won't.

01:29:25.022 --> 01:29:27.022
I won't. I promise I won't.

01:29:27.024 --> 01:29:30.003
I won't let them
take you from me.

01:29:30.005 --> 01:29:33.007

01:30:07.024 --> 01:30:10.002
The police is out, aunt!

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:12.000
The police is out!

01:30:12.002 --> 01:30:15.024
Harry, we had company
for dinner.

01:30:15.026 --> 01:30:18.026
Mr. Wright and his brother

01:30:18.028 --> 01:30:21.020
and his sweet wife.

01:30:21.022 --> 01:30:22.026
Poor thing!

01:30:22.028 --> 01:30:24.016
Aunt, that was the Biddles!

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:26.001
'What Biddles?'

01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:28.011
The killers the police
are looking for.

01:30:28.013 --> 01:30:30.019
'I bet you gave dinner
to the Biddles.'

01:30:32.024 --> 01:30:34.016
They are here yet, Harry!

01:30:34.018 --> 01:30:36.014
Still!

01:30:36.028 --> 01:30:37.028
Oh!

01:30:39.022 --> 01:30:41.007
Oh!

01:30:41.009 --> 01:30:42.009
Ssh.

01:30:56.018 --> 01:30:58.011
You a Biddle?

01:30:58.013 --> 01:31:00.012
The police is looking for
you.

01:31:00.014 --> 01:31:02.008
Oh, Mr. Watson!

01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:04.020
Call the officers back!

01:31:07.023 --> 01:31:09.001
[whispering]

01:31:09.003 --> 01:31:10.010
[laughs]

01:31:12.009 --> 01:31:13.008
We gotta go.

01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:15.023
Get me the Prospect police!

01:31:15.025 --> 01:31:18.012
Yes, ma'am, the police!

01:31:18.014 --> 01:31:21.014
My poor husband's
in that house with them.

01:31:22.024 --> 01:31:25.006
You men take some guns

01:31:25.008 --> 01:31:27.007
and go in after those boys!

01:31:27.009 --> 01:31:28.028
