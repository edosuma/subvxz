WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:02.100
Today on <i>tool time,</i>

00:02.101 --> 00:04.903
We're gonna talk about
a real american hero -

00:04.904 --> 00:06.905
The supersize sausage...

00:06.906 --> 00:09.273
<i>(groans)</i> submarine,

00:09.274 --> 00:11.843
Also known
as the ss <i>cholesterol.</i>

00:11.844 --> 00:14.779
I thought we were talking
about squeaky floors.

00:14.780 --> 00:15.981
We are, we are.

00:15.982 --> 00:17.882
And the obvious connection
would be?

00:17.883 --> 00:19.383
Stick with me.

00:19.384 --> 00:21.385
Let's say your wife has you

00:21.386 --> 00:24.055
On one of those low-cal
mulch and grass diets,

00:24.056 --> 00:26.390
But you got
one of these bad boys

00:26.391 --> 00:28.960
Hidden out in that camp cooler
in the garage.

00:28.961 --> 00:32.964
So you wait
till she drifts off to sleep,
snoring like a band saw.

00:32.965 --> 00:35.466
You creep out to the garage
to get it,

00:35.467 --> 00:38.469
But as soon as your feet
hit the floor, what happens?

00:38.470 --> 00:41.906
<i>(wood creaks)</i>

00:43.075 --> 00:44.709
She wakes up.

00:44.710 --> 00:48.546
"hey, leave that
submarine sandwich alone,
you big tub of lard!

00:48.547 --> 00:50.548
"get back into bed!

00:50.549 --> 00:54.519
You're gonna be eating nothing
but fiber for three months!"

00:54.520 --> 00:57.221
And you doubted
the connection.

01:02.061 --> 01:05.030
I'm hating myself now.

01:05.031 --> 01:09.500
The point is, today,
how do you get rid of
that tattletale squeak?

01:09.501 --> 01:12.170
First you have to determine
if you have a squeak...
<i>(metal squeaks)</i>

01:12.171 --> 01:13.471
A creak...
<i>(wood creaks)</i>

01:13.472 --> 01:16.074
Or a groan...
<i>(tim moans with pleasure)</i>

01:22.114 --> 01:25.583
...Because each one of those
will require a different repair.

01:25.584 --> 01:27.285
Right, al.

01:27.286 --> 01:29.287
Larry, you wanna bring
the camera in here.

01:29.288 --> 01:32.390
Normally,
a squeak is caused by wood
rubbing against a loose nail.

01:32.391 --> 01:35.060
Now, if you have your squeak
between the joists,

01:35.061 --> 01:37.896
What you wanna do
is add a bridge.

01:37.897 --> 01:39.463
Right.

01:39.464 --> 01:44.703
Now... Older homes,
like older people,
tend to groan.

01:44.704 --> 01:47.205
That's because
there's a sag and weakening

01:47.206 --> 01:49.207
Between the beam
and the joist.

01:49.208 --> 01:50.875
"oh, my aching beam.

01:50.876 --> 01:55.213
I got such a pain in the joist,
you shouldn't know!"

01:55.214 --> 01:57.548
Our older viewers
will wanna write tim

01:57.549 --> 02:03.454
At <i>"tool time,</i>
p.O. Box 32733..."

02:05.024 --> 02:07.025
Now, if you have a creak -

02:07.026 --> 02:09.660
Which happens when two boards
rub against each other -

02:09.661 --> 02:11.730
We have
an old carpenter's remedy.

02:11.731 --> 02:14.565
Take an old
squeezable ketchup bottle,
fill it with talcum powder.

02:14.566 --> 02:16.901
You wanna direct the talc
between the boards,

02:16.902 --> 02:18.069
Give it
a good healthy squeeze.

02:31.483 --> 02:33.818
You know, I don't think
many people know,

02:33.819 --> 02:36.087
But on weekends
al does mime at the mall.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.994
Look at these apples, al.

03:56.668 --> 03:59.737
What do you think? Should we
put the kids in the middle?

04:02.875 --> 04:06.244
<i>(â™ª "mary had a little lamb,"</i>
<i>out of tune)</i>

04:18.557 --> 04:21.892
Sorry, dad.
Ah, it's just a toe.
You're doing great.

04:21.894 --> 04:25.463
No, I'm not. I think I should
just quit. I'm no good at this.

04:25.464 --> 04:28.066
I'm no good at a lot of things.
Doesn't stop me.

04:29.534 --> 04:32.036
I don't wanna hear anything more
about you quitting.

04:33.939 --> 04:36.640
Good news -
I think he's gonna quit.

04:36.641 --> 04:39.643
He can't quit. He's only
been doing it three weeks.

04:39.644 --> 04:42.146
Besides, I really think
he's getting better.

04:42.147 --> 04:45.583
Better? He sounds
like al's mom at a luau.

04:45.584 --> 04:48.019
<i>(imitates woman</i>
<i>singing badly)</i>

04:48.020 --> 04:50.688
Tim, he begged us
for those saxophone lessons.

04:50.689 --> 04:52.523
I'm trying to teach -
excuse me.

04:52.524 --> 04:55.393
I'm trying to teach him
to stick with something,
follow it through.

04:55.394 --> 04:57.728
You don't want him
to be a quitter, do you?

04:57.729 --> 04:59.730
Quitting would be
a bad thing.

04:59.731 --> 05:02.767
<i>(brad plays flat note)</i>

05:02.768 --> 05:05.937
But being a quitter's parents -
we could live with that.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.772
It's always bad
in the beginning.

05:07.773 --> 05:10.108
You think mozart's parents
enjoyed listening
to him practice?

05:10.109 --> 05:13.411
Great example.
They named their kid wolfman.

05:13.412 --> 05:15.113
Wolfgang.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.849
So, a group of wolves.
What's the difference?

05:18.850 --> 05:22.120
I really stink at this.
No, you don't.
You just got started.

05:22.121 --> 05:24.122
It'll take you
a couple of months

05:24.123 --> 05:26.124
To figure out
whether you stink or not.

05:28.260 --> 05:30.261
Whoa. You're all wet.

05:30.262 --> 05:32.230
Good work, sherlock.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.532
What happened?

05:34.533 --> 05:38.602
Paul and vinnie mcgurn
stuck me upside down
in a snowbank.

05:38.603 --> 05:40.104
I hate those guys.

05:40.105 --> 05:42.840
I thought we told you
to stay away from the mcgurns.

05:42.841 --> 05:45.910
They're big, ugly and stupid.
That's a lethal combination.

05:45.911 --> 05:47.412
I had no choice.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.613
Vinnie challenged me
to a sled race.

05:49.614 --> 05:52.116
So you beat the guy
and he dumped you
in a snowbank?

05:52.117 --> 05:53.818
That's typical
of those guys.

05:53.819 --> 05:57.989
No, they beat me,
and this was part of
their victory celebration.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.523
I hate those guys.

05:59.524 --> 06:03.094
I swear, this time
I'm gonna get 'em back.

06:03.095 --> 06:04.895
I hate those guys!

06:04.896 --> 06:06.730
We know, brad.

06:06.731 --> 06:09.400
I'm just gonna
walk up to vinnie
and start swinging.

06:09.401 --> 06:12.670
No, randy, don't be stupid.
Don't try to fight vinnie.

06:12.671 --> 06:14.705
For once, brad's right.
Listen to him.

06:14.706 --> 06:16.774
Get someone else
to beat up vinnie.

06:16.775 --> 06:19.143
There's this one boy
in my class, his name's troy.

06:19.144 --> 06:22.280
For a quarter,
he'll punch <i>himself</i>
in the face.

06:22.281 --> 06:25.683
<i>(laughs)</i>

06:25.684 --> 06:28.686
I've always told you guys,
fists don't accomplish anything.

06:28.687 --> 06:31.622
You can get vinnie mcgurn back
at his own game.

06:31.623 --> 06:33.757
What are you talking about?

06:33.758 --> 06:36.027
Challenge him
to another race.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.529
Dad, there's no way
I can beat vinnie.

06:38.530 --> 06:41.765
He has that new sled -
the bullet-nosed
downhill racer.

06:41.766 --> 06:45.036
But you got the tool man.

06:45.037 --> 06:48.239
I think we can
turn this old jalopy
into a speed demon.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.908
It's light,
it's got a classic design.

06:50.909 --> 06:53.744
Maybe put a spoiler
on the front of that
for airflow.

06:53.745 --> 06:56.580
I'll take the burrs
off these runners,
sand this thing down,

06:56.581 --> 06:58.749
Bevel the edge,
put a shine on there.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.252
This'll be smoother than butter
on a baby's butt.

07:01.253 --> 07:04.022
Arr-arr-arr-arr-arr.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.057
I hate those guys.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.759
Let it go, will ya?
Just let it go.

07:10.862 --> 07:13.931
Mark, go get your shoes on.
I'm taking you for a haircut.

07:13.932 --> 07:15.933
Mom, I don't need a haircut.

07:15.934 --> 07:19.037
Oh, please.
I could turn you upside down
and mop the floor with you.

07:19.038 --> 07:22.673
Besides, the barber
is right next to brad's
saxophone teacher.

07:22.674 --> 07:26.010
I can get you a trim
while he's having
his lesson.

07:26.011 --> 07:28.212
You just wanna get out of
hearing brad play.

07:28.213 --> 07:31.149
I never said that,
and if it gets around,
I never said that.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.983
Brad,
where's your saxophone?

07:32.984 --> 07:35.153
You have a lesson
in 20 minutes.

07:35.154 --> 07:38.156
Mom, why do I
have to keep taking
these stupid lessons?

07:38.157 --> 07:39.657
Brad, sit down.

07:39.658 --> 07:41.659
Is this gonna be
another one of those

07:41.660 --> 07:43.661
"when I was a little girl"
stories?

07:43.662 --> 07:45.596
No. Will you just listen?

07:51.070 --> 07:53.837
When I was a little person
about your age...

07:53.838 --> 07:56.674
I had to take flute lessons
for five years,

07:56.675 --> 07:58.676
And it wasn't always fun,

07:58.677 --> 08:01.946
But I was really glad
that I stuck to it.

08:01.947 --> 08:05.216
Why? It's not like
you ever play the flute now.

08:05.217 --> 08:07.351
Well, that's true,

08:07.352 --> 08:09.353
But I take great joy

08:09.354 --> 08:11.922
In knowing
that I could if I wanted to.

08:11.923 --> 08:14.425
Besides, if you get
really good at it,

08:14.426 --> 08:17.895
We could have mother/son
jam sessions.

08:17.896 --> 08:20.064
There's a dream come true.

08:22.867 --> 08:26.003
<i>(mark)</i> mom,
can't find my shoes!

08:26.004 --> 08:28.973
I swear, if his head
wasn't attached, he'd...

08:28.974 --> 08:32.775
Oh, no. I'm channeling
my mother again.

08:32.777 --> 08:35.145
I'm coming!

08:37.716 --> 08:39.116
<i>(groans)</i>

08:39.118 --> 08:42.852
Hey, randy, did you
test out the sled?
Yeah.

08:42.854 --> 08:44.855
Was dad's spoiler cool?

08:44.856 --> 08:49.260
Yeah. I was going so fast,
I think I missed
my next birthday.

08:50.496 --> 08:53.331
Dang, that's fast.

08:53.332 --> 08:56.000
Ahh.
What happened
to your wrist?

08:56.001 --> 08:58.102
When I hit dead man's curve,

08:58.103 --> 09:01.105
My sled went one way
and my wrist went another -

09:01.106 --> 09:03.441
Right into a tree.

09:03.442 --> 09:05.243
Ahh.
Well, is the sled ok?

09:08.647 --> 09:10.648
Yes. Thanks for caring.

09:10.649 --> 09:11.815
Ahh.

09:11.816 --> 09:13.083
Here comes mom.

09:13.084 --> 09:14.952
Don't tell her
about my wrist.

09:14.953 --> 09:16.454
She'll overreact.

09:16.455 --> 09:18.756
Ok, come on, brad.
Randy, hi.
Hi.

09:18.757 --> 09:21.925
Listen, your dad's
just pulling up now.
We'll be back before dinner.

09:21.926 --> 09:24.962
Hi.
Bye!

09:24.963 --> 09:27.865
Boy, we lead
fast-paced lives.

09:29.434 --> 09:32.336
Hey, randy.
Hey, dad.

09:32.337 --> 09:33.871
What's the matter?

09:33.872 --> 09:36.374
I had a little run-in
with a tree.

09:36.375 --> 09:39.076
Who started it?

09:39.077 --> 09:42.012
The tree.
Hey.

09:42.013 --> 09:44.982
Did your mom see this?
No.

09:44.983 --> 09:46.317
Ahh.

09:46.318 --> 09:48.786
Can you bend it?
Sort of.

09:48.787 --> 09:51.489
All right,
can you do this?

09:51.490 --> 09:53.591
Yeah. Can you do this?

09:58.330 --> 10:01.532
All right, smart guy,
sit up there, let me
take a look at it.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.967
Careful, careful.

10:03.968 --> 10:05.603
Ooh.

10:05.604 --> 10:08.372
Ow!
Ooh. That hurts, huh?

10:08.373 --> 10:12.510
No, I just have a condition
that makes me say "ow"
every ten minutes.

10:12.511 --> 10:15.513
I'm gonna run you down
to the emergency room
get an x-ray for you,

10:15.514 --> 10:17.047
Write a note to mom.

10:17.048 --> 10:19.383
Dad, I don't need to go
to the emergency room.

10:19.384 --> 10:22.386
<i>(laughs)</i> that's what
I usually tell al.

10:25.023 --> 10:27.692
Well, how does he
get you to go?

10:27.693 --> 10:30.761
I don't know.
I'm usually passed out by then.

10:32.997 --> 10:35.999
<i>(tim)</i> don't worry. They'll take
real good care of you here.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.669
Is this the emergency room
you come to all the time?

10:38.670 --> 10:40.671
I don't come here
all the time.

10:40.672 --> 10:42.172
Hey, tool man.
Hey, buddy.

10:42.173 --> 10:44.141
Hi, mr. Taylor.
Hey, tim.

10:44.142 --> 10:47.278
Hey, buzz. How are
those little girls...?
Good. Real good.

10:47.279 --> 10:48.846
Hey, laurie.

10:48.847 --> 10:51.882
You're better known here
than you are at sears.

10:51.883 --> 10:55.386
Mr. Taylor.
And you walked in
under your own power.

10:55.387 --> 10:57.255
Always a good sign.

10:57.256 --> 11:00.858
Well, actually...
You know,
I keep your file handy.

11:03.395 --> 11:05.696
Actually...
That's all you?

11:05.697 --> 11:07.698
That's just this year.

11:07.699 --> 11:10.301
It's not me today, marge.
It's my little son randy.

11:10.302 --> 11:13.804
Well, how cute -
like father, like son.

11:13.805 --> 11:15.573
What's doing, randy?

11:15.574 --> 11:18.576
He went off of his sled
and hit his wrist.

11:18.577 --> 11:21.279
We'll take care of that.
You know the drill.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.281
Ok. Come on over here
and sit down.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.783
<i>(woman over pa) dr. Smith,</i>
<i>report to the emergency room.</i>

11:25.784 --> 11:27.285
<i>Dr. Smith, emergency room.</i>

11:27.286 --> 11:29.119
You doing all right?
Yeah.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.222
Ok, let's fill this out
quick.

11:32.223 --> 11:35.092
Birthday is the 18th.
8th.

11:35.093 --> 11:36.761
Eighth.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.797
97 pounds on you.
No, 80.

11:39.798 --> 11:42.333
80. All right.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.402
Big brown eyes.

11:46.538 --> 11:48.339
Big blue eyes.

11:48.340 --> 11:49.440
Ok.

11:49.441 --> 11:51.575
Here you go, tim.

11:53.845 --> 11:57.481
Coffee
just the way you like it -
cream and five sugars.

11:57.482 --> 11:59.450
Thank you, buzz.

11:59.451 --> 12:02.820
Couple more sugars,
they gonna be
calling <i>you</i> buzz.

12:02.821 --> 12:04.054
All right.

12:04.055 --> 12:05.723
What's gonna happen now?

12:05.724 --> 12:07.792
They're gonna
run you back to x-ray,

12:07.793 --> 12:09.760
Take a photograph
of your wrist.

12:09.761 --> 12:12.763
What if it's broken?
Don't worry about it.
They're great here.

12:12.764 --> 12:15.766
They'll set it in a cast,
and you'll be good as new
in two months.

12:15.767 --> 12:19.603
Two months?
It goes just like that.

12:19.604 --> 12:23.307
I remember when I broke my arm.
I was younger than you.

12:23.308 --> 12:25.343
Well, how'd you break it?

12:25.344 --> 12:27.645
Well, the first time...

12:27.646 --> 12:31.382
I was six or so,
in the garage looking
at my little red wagon.

12:31.383 --> 12:32.717
Arr-arr-arr-arr.

12:32.718 --> 12:35.252
"that thing needs more power."
arr-arr-arr-arr.

12:35.253 --> 12:36.487
<i>(chuckles)</i>

12:36.488 --> 12:38.656
I'm not sure mom's
gonna be too happy

12:38.657 --> 12:40.825
When she finds out
we souped up the sled.

12:40.826 --> 12:42.926
Don't worry about it.
Do we have to tell her?

12:42.927 --> 12:44.995
Yes, yes. You can't lie
to your mom.

12:44.996 --> 12:48.733
I get two lies a year,
and I'm not wasting one on you.

12:50.702 --> 12:53.504
Mr. Taylor,
this way to x-ray.

12:53.505 --> 12:55.439
Look who I'm telling!

12:57.108 --> 12:59.777
You know, marge,
it's kind of gratifying

12:59.778 --> 13:03.347
To be here in the hospital
and not be a patient.

13:03.348 --> 13:04.348
See ya, tool man.

13:04.349 --> 13:05.883
Hey, buddy.

13:08.787 --> 13:12.155
Well, maybe you can
have that feeling
another day.

13:12.156 --> 13:14.157
Medic!
It's all right.

13:14.158 --> 13:15.860
It's all right.
Medic!

13:17.695 --> 13:20.130
Whew. I'm home.

13:20.131 --> 13:22.165
What happened at the hospital?
How's randy's arm?

13:22.166 --> 13:24.167
It's fine.
Doctor says it's sprained.

13:24.168 --> 13:26.169
He'll be up and at 'em,
two days.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.205
Oh, thank goodness.
Where is he?

13:28.206 --> 13:30.708
He's over at jeremy's,
showing him <i>my</i> x-ray.

13:30.709 --> 13:33.176
Your x-ray?
I banged my head
down there.

13:33.177 --> 13:35.413
Took an x-ray.
Showed nothing.

13:38.049 --> 13:39.917
Big surprise.

13:39.918 --> 13:41.919
<i>(mocking)</i>
"big surprise."
mm-hmm.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.754
What are we eating?
Pizza.

13:43.755 --> 13:45.756
Will you set the table?
Uh-huh.

13:45.757 --> 13:48.426
So what happened to randy?
The sled got away from him?

13:48.427 --> 13:50.428
You know how they are
with those sleds.

13:50.429 --> 13:52.430
It gets all icy,
wind catches
the spoiler...

13:52.431 --> 13:54.832
<i>(whistles)</i>
wait a minute.

13:54.833 --> 13:58.201
Since when
do sleds have spoilers?

13:58.202 --> 14:01.271
It's not uncommon.

14:01.272 --> 14:04.675
I don't believe you.
You powered up the sled?

14:04.676 --> 14:06.677
I tweaked it a little bit.

14:06.678 --> 14:09.747
It's not like
I put a motor on it.
Although...

14:09.748 --> 14:11.014
Tim...

14:11.015 --> 14:13.451
I just did it
because the mcgurns' father

14:13.452 --> 14:15.886
Bought them this downhill
bullet-nosed racer.

14:15.887 --> 14:19.690
So what?
So... Randy challenged 'em
to a race.

14:19.691 --> 14:21.692
That was a stupid thing to do.

14:21.693 --> 14:25.228
Not quite as stupid
as what he originally planned.
Which was?

14:25.229 --> 14:28.231
He was gonna hire some kid
that hits himself in the face

14:28.232 --> 14:30.233
To fight vinnie mcgurn
with him.

14:30.234 --> 14:31.201
Troy?

14:34.005 --> 14:36.574
I suggested
a more sensible alternative.

14:36.575 --> 14:37.975
Oh, a sensible one,

14:37.976 --> 14:40.544
Like sending our son
barreling down a hill
on a death machine

14:40.545 --> 14:42.212
To win some stupid race?

14:42.213 --> 14:44.181
You are so wrong.

14:44.182 --> 14:48.185
This is a practice run.
The race isn't till Saturday.

14:48.186 --> 14:50.253
No, it's not.

14:50.254 --> 14:53.156
Yes, it is.
He was challenged by vinnie.

14:53.157 --> 14:55.225
You said that randy
challenged vinnie.

14:55.226 --> 14:57.427
Yeah, well, then vinnie
challenged him back.

14:57.428 --> 14:58.929
You just don't understand

14:58.930 --> 15:00.931
The intricacies
of the male mind.

15:00.932 --> 15:03.100
Explain it to me.
I've got a minute.

15:03.101 --> 15:05.703
Ok. Guy a challenges guy b.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.905
If guy b
accepts the challenge,

15:07.906 --> 15:10.641
Guy a is automatically
challenged by guy b

15:10.642 --> 15:13.577
Not to back down
from the challenge
that a gave to guy b.

15:16.447 --> 15:19.750
Ok, let me explain to you
how a woman's mind works.

15:19.751 --> 15:23.086
Guy a and guy b are both idiots,
and randy is not racing.

15:24.455 --> 15:26.356
Come on.

15:26.357 --> 15:28.993
Sugarplum.
Honeybuns.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.228
There's nothing wrong
with two kids

15:31.229 --> 15:33.831
Having a nice race
down dead man's curve.

15:33.832 --> 15:35.533
Down what?

15:35.534 --> 15:38.135
Fred man's curve.

15:48.413 --> 15:51.582
It's gonna take your mom
about two minutes to find that.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.652
Now, if you bury it,
you might have a shot at it.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.154
Dad, I'm no good
at playing the saxophone.

15:57.155 --> 16:00.624
You were great this morning
playing "baa baa black sheep."

16:00.625 --> 16:02.960
Dad, that was
"mary had a little lamb."

16:02.961 --> 16:04.962
Well, lamb, sheep -
it's all about wool.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.797
Just try a little harder,
will ya?

16:06.798 --> 16:09.466
<i>(cat meowing)</i>

16:09.467 --> 16:11.468
Wilson, what are you
doing up there?

16:11.469 --> 16:14.471
Well, tim, I am trying
to get mrs. Foley's cat fluffy

16:14.472 --> 16:17.908
Out of that tree.
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

16:17.909 --> 16:21.378
<i>(sighs)</i>
so how was your day?
Little frustrating.

16:21.379 --> 16:24.448
I'm trying to explain to jill
the meaning of the word
"challenge."

16:24.449 --> 16:26.383
I would think,
living with you,

16:26.384 --> 16:28.385
That she'd be an expert
on that.

16:28.386 --> 16:31.121
<i>(mock laugh)</i>
no, I mean when one man
challenges another man.

16:31.122 --> 16:33.791
She doesn't realize
you can't back down from that.

16:33.792 --> 16:37.027
Aha. So al
is being obstreperous
at work again?

16:37.028 --> 16:39.997
No, he took some penicillin
and cleared that up.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.999
You know vinnie mcgurn
next door?

16:42.000 --> 16:45.535
Yes indeed. He's the reason
that fluffy's up in the tree.

16:45.536 --> 16:47.437
Well, he and randy
got themselves

16:47.438 --> 16:49.439
Into this sled race
challenge....
Uh-huh.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.675
...And jill doesn't want him
to do it.

16:51.676 --> 16:53.677
She's afraid
he might hurt himself.

16:53.678 --> 16:57.414
Well, tim, jill's reaction
is quite... Quite natural.

16:57.415 --> 17:00.450
It's common
for the female of the species
to protect her young.

17:00.451 --> 17:02.452
Well, I'm trying
to protect my young

17:02.453 --> 17:04.954
From the vinnie mcgurns
of the world.
Aha-ha.

17:04.955 --> 17:06.957
So you are encouraging randy

17:06.958 --> 17:09.159
To act
like the saiga antelope.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.095
Yeah. Yeah, exac... What?

17:11.096 --> 17:14.164
The saiga antelope.
They roam the russian plains.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.867
Any invader who challenges
the male's domain

17:16.867 --> 17:18.868
Is met with a fight.

17:18.869 --> 17:20.436
Arr. Russia.

17:20.438 --> 17:23.741
â™ª where the deer
and the antelope play

17:23.742 --> 17:26.109
Unfortunately,
the males of the species

17:26.111 --> 17:29.579
Are so obsessed
with running back and forth
and butting heads

17:29.580 --> 17:31.615
That they barely ever eat,

17:31.616 --> 17:34.618
So that when wintertime comes
they have no body fat.

17:34.619 --> 17:37.154
They starve to death.

17:37.155 --> 17:43.493
â™ª and the sky is not cloudy
all day-ay, yah â™ª

17:43.494 --> 17:46.263
See, tim,
you can't allow a challenge

17:46.264 --> 17:49.199
To make you lose sight
of what is really important.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.543
Hi. How's your hand?
Fine, mom.

17:59.544 --> 18:01.311
What are you doing?

18:01.312 --> 18:03.246
Working on my sled.

18:03.247 --> 18:05.248
I wanna talk to you
about that.

18:05.249 --> 18:07.417
I don't think you should
do this race on Saturday.

18:07.418 --> 18:09.119
Mom, I have to.

18:09.120 --> 18:12.355
My wrist is gonna be fine.
Even the doctor said so.

18:12.356 --> 18:16.359
I just think
the combination of that hill,
that sled and your father

18:16.360 --> 18:18.361
Is too dangerous.

18:18.362 --> 18:20.230
But mom,
I'm fixing my sled,

18:20.231 --> 18:22.966
And dad's gonna show me
what I did wrong.

18:22.967 --> 18:25.635
I don't see why you have to
race vinnie mcgurn at all.

18:25.636 --> 18:28.672
Because if I don't,
he's gonna think I'm afraid
of him, and I'm not.

18:28.673 --> 18:31.341
You should be
afraid of him.
He's a scary guy.

18:31.342 --> 18:33.043
Ha. No kidding.

18:33.044 --> 18:34.878
At the father/son picnic,

18:34.879 --> 18:38.082
He's the only kid
that was mistaken
for his father.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.551
Now, you see, that's funny.

18:41.552 --> 18:43.687
Humor has always been
your best weapon.

18:43.688 --> 18:47.091
But vinnie's too stupid
to understand my jokes.

18:49.393 --> 18:52.462
In your life, you're
gonna run up against
a million vinnie mcgurns.

18:52.463 --> 18:55.465
Are you planning
on racing all of them?
I don't know.

18:55.466 --> 18:58.202
All I know is that
I have to race this one.

18:58.203 --> 19:00.037
I have to fight back.

19:00.038 --> 19:03.540
But it's not a fair fight.
I'm never gonna have
a fair fight.

19:03.541 --> 19:05.609
I'm the shortest kid
in my class!
Honey...

19:05.610 --> 19:08.612
And don't tell me
my height doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

19:08.613 --> 19:10.614
It's what's inside
that counts.

19:10.615 --> 19:13.283
Don't sell yourself short.
Sorry.

19:15.386 --> 19:17.654
Look, in case
you haven't noticed,

19:17.655 --> 19:20.657
Even my little brother
is the same size as me.

19:20.658 --> 19:22.726
Randy...

19:22.727 --> 19:24.928
Everybody grows
at their own rate.

19:24.929 --> 19:27.097
Mark just had
a growth spurt.

19:27.098 --> 19:29.432
I mean,
you could have one
at any time.

19:29.433 --> 19:32.002
Yeah, but probably not
by this weekend, huh?

19:33.638 --> 19:35.639
No, probably not.

19:38.910 --> 19:40.911
I'm gonna say something
to you

19:40.912 --> 19:43.914
That I thought
that I would never say
to any of my kids.

19:43.915 --> 19:45.415
What?

19:47.185 --> 19:49.086
Kick some butt.

19:49.087 --> 19:50.520
All right!

19:57.328 --> 19:59.329
â™ª home, home on the... â™ª

19:59.330 --> 20:00.931
Hey, tim?

20:00.932 --> 20:03.801
Jill, we gotta talk.
Yeah.

20:03.802 --> 20:06.770
Um... Randy's situation

20:06.771 --> 20:10.307
Is a lot like
the psychic antelope

20:10.308 --> 20:12.876
That pig out
all summer long

20:12.877 --> 20:16.980
And finally
act like buttheads
to the russians.

20:16.981 --> 20:20.450
I was with you right up to,
"jill, we have to talk."

20:20.451 --> 20:22.552
What I'm saying...

20:26.657 --> 20:28.325
What?

20:33.965 --> 20:36.200
I don't think randy
has to prove anything
to vinnie mcgurn.

20:36.201 --> 20:39.203
I don't think
there's any reason for him
to race the kid over this.

20:39.204 --> 20:43.273
Oh, I think
he does have to race him.
<i>(quizzical grunt)</i>

20:43.274 --> 20:46.310
Unfortunately,
randy feels that he has to
prove something to himself,

20:46.311 --> 20:48.645
And we have to let him do this.

20:48.646 --> 20:50.647
Now, I was wondering...

20:50.648 --> 20:53.650
Is there some way
that you can make
the spoiler bigger

20:53.651 --> 20:56.553
And bevel the edges more?

20:56.554 --> 20:59.456
Are y...
Are you <i>my</i> wife?
Yeah.

20:59.457 --> 21:02.326
I read somewhere that if
you heat the runners up,
it makes it go faster.

21:02.327 --> 21:04.828
Is that true?
That's illegal, jill.

21:04.829 --> 21:07.464
What is this,
the olympics?

21:07.465 --> 21:11.434
Have you ever noticed
that we agree on everything

21:11.435 --> 21:14.704
But never at the same time?

21:14.705 --> 21:18.075
Well, I have to admit
that this time you were right.

21:18.076 --> 21:21.044
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

21:21.045 --> 21:23.347
<i>(sighs)</i>

21:24.916 --> 21:27.851
<i>(chuckles)</i>

21:27.852 --> 21:31.321
If I'm right,
you would be...

21:33.491 --> 21:35.692
Starts with "w."

21:37.929 --> 21:40.697
Your wonderful wise wife.

21:40.698 --> 21:42.299
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no.

21:42.300 --> 21:46.203
Ah. If someone
isn't right...
Mm-hmm.

21:46.204 --> 21:50.573
...They're generally
referred to as "wr..."

21:50.574 --> 21:52.575
Really open-minded
and big enough

21:52.576 --> 21:54.611
To listen
to other people's opinions.

21:54.612 --> 21:55.979
Ok. No.

21:55.980 --> 21:58.481
I'm looking for something
that rhymes with "song."

21:58.482 --> 22:00.117
<i>(laughs)</i>

22:00.118 --> 22:01.684
Right!

22:01.685 --> 22:03.253
So long.

22:07.425 --> 22:10.160
That was cool
how you beat vinnie
in that race.

22:10.161 --> 22:13.230
Yeah, did you see the way
I took that curve?
It was perfect.

22:13.231 --> 22:16.266
And I told you
to race him.
Yeah, right, mom.

22:16.267 --> 22:19.169
Here you go.
<i>(western playing on tv)</i>

22:19.170 --> 22:21.838
Hey, did you see
how mad vinnie's father got

22:21.839 --> 22:24.641
When dad was doing
that victory dance?

22:24.642 --> 22:27.677
I can't believe
he challenged him
to the race.

22:27.678 --> 22:30.047
I can't believe your father
accepted the challenge.

22:30.048 --> 22:32.182
Oh, it's just a sprain.

Also known
as the ss <i>cholesterol.</i>

22:43.727 --> 22:45.996
<i>(whistles)</i>

22:48.499 --> 22:50.434
<i>(mutters)</i>

22:50.435 --> 22:54.204
Any invader who tries to
challenge the male's domain
is met with a fight.

22:57.141 --> 22:59.142
Can't remember that song
all of a sudden.

22:59.143 --> 23:01.744
It's... Lucille.

23:01.745 --> 23:04.481
I can't believe
he challenged dad
to the race.

23:04.482 --> 23:06.483
I can't believe your father
accepted the challenge.

23:06.484 --> 23:08.485
Oh, it's just a sprain.

23:10.488 --> 23:13.457
I'll get that guy
in a rematch,
I'll tell you that.

23:19.897 --> 23:24.167
All right, once more.
One more time.
