<i>I think life's greatest lessons can
be learned on the baseball field.</i>

00:35.736 --> 00:37.670
<i>You got a little bit of everything,</i>

00:37.671 --> 00:42.170
<i>heroes, hope, love.</i>

00:42.175 --> 00:44.410
<i>Time stops,</i>

00:44.411 --> 00:47.179
<i>you play at your own pace.</i>

00:47.180 --> 00:49.107
<i>It teaches teamwork</i>

00:49.108 --> 00:53.486
<i>and the everlasting joy</i>
<i>of shared victory,</i>

00:53.487 --> 00:57.490
<i>and it also prepares you</i>
<i>to deal with defeat.</i>

00:57.591 --> 01:01.760
<i>I mean let's face it, life</i>
<i>isn't just walk off home runs</i>

01:01.761 --> 01:06.995
<i>and timely base-hits,</i>
<i>it's curve balls aplenty.</i>

01:07.134 --> 01:09.702
<i>Nothing prepares you for the curve,</i>

01:09.703 --> 01:11.837
<i>it comes out of nowhere</i>

01:11.838 --> 01:14.507
<i>and can knock you off your feet,</i>

01:14.508 --> 01:17.510
<i>but that's the great</i>
<i>thing about baseball...</i>

01:17.511 --> 01:19.478
<i>if you stay with it...</i>

01:19.479 --> 01:22.515
<i>stare down your fears...</i>

01:23.116 --> 01:26.386
<i>you just might get a second chance.</i>

01:31.725 --> 01:34.727
Check out the movement on this
one, Dad. Here comes the heat.

01:34.728 --> 01:38.464
Put it here, Jack right here,
right here. Steeeriike 2!

01:38.465 --> 01:41.534
Atta boy, Jack. Good throw.

01:41.535 --> 01:47.206
Here we are at the World Series.
It all comes down to this...

01:47.207 --> 01:52.808
What will the great
Mariano Rivera do?

01:52.846 --> 01:55.113
The wind up.

01:59.186 --> 02:02.455
Steee-rike 3! That is the game.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.123
That is the ball game.

02:04.124 --> 02:08.360
Mo strikes him out with a
curve ball. The Yankees win!

02:08.362 --> 02:11.330
The Yankees win!

02:11.331 --> 02:14.767
Good game, Jack, good game. But I
have to tell you something, you know.

02:14.768 --> 02:18.536
Uh, Mariano never
throws a curve ball.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.733
C'mon. Ready for some dinner?

02:51.638 --> 02:53.839
Dad...

02:53.840 --> 02:58.377
Hey, pal. Are you alright? Huh?

02:58.378 --> 03:00.779
Jack!

03:04.384 --> 03:07.152
Jack!

03:28.942 --> 03:31.210
Matsui steps back in.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.702
Boy they could really use a
little magic from him tonight,

03:33.703 --> 03:36.448
- couldn't they, Michael?
- Yes, they could, John.

03:36.449 --> 03:40.318
The pitch. It's a breaking
ball cut on and missed.

03:40.319 --> 03:45.824
Well, that ends the inning.
Yankees still down by four.

04:07.347 --> 04:10.449
Hey, everyone. How's it going?

04:10.450 --> 04:13.595
Not so good. Top of the third,
Yankees are losing.

04:13.596 --> 04:16.654
Aah, it's early. They'll
figure something out.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.016
You know why, Jack?

04:21.384 --> 04:24.663
It's called Yankee magic.

04:24.664 --> 04:28.334
And I've got a whole stash
of the stuff in my office.

04:28.335 --> 04:32.505
And I figured I'd give you some,

04:32.506 --> 04:35.574
if you want it.

04:39.611 --> 04:42.715
Can I speak to you
outside for a moment?

04:42.716 --> 04:46.984
Don't go anywhere, kiddo.
I'll be right back.

05:01.635 --> 05:06.038
You know we've always said that the mental
part is just as important as the physical.

05:06.039 --> 05:10.776
And I'm really concerned because...
Jack isn't speaking.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.345
And if we ever got
to a place where...

05:13.346 --> 05:16.448
- Well...
- He's fine. He's just tired.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.517
He's been through so much.

05:18.518 --> 05:23.422
I know, I know. I just want to
make sure that he's ready for this.

05:23.423 --> 05:28.403
Because there's a long
and difficult road ahead.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.695
He's ready.

05:31.964 --> 05:36.067
Okay. Then let's do it.

05:45.278 --> 05:49.881
- How you doin' doc?
- It's time for a miracle, Ruth.

05:50.820 --> 05:53.787
It's time for a miracle.

05:56.586 --> 06:01.659
Alright Jackie boy, the doctor
says you are ready to go.

06:01.995 --> 06:05.097
Hey, you can do this.

06:05.098 --> 06:09.167
Compared to the other stuff,
this is a piece of cake.

06:12.397 --> 06:15.774
Hey, Jack. This is going
to help you relax.

06:15.775 --> 06:21.112
You're going to have
beautiful dreams. Okay?

06:24.381 --> 06:27.385
- Wait.
- Hang on a second.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.490
There you go.

06:36.171 --> 06:39.665
I love you, honey, and I'll
see you in a few short hours.

06:39.666 --> 06:43.435
Hey, Jackie, I found a
new batting cage for us.

06:43.436 --> 06:46.538
Maybe we'll go try it
out next week, huh?

06:46.539 --> 06:47.473
Alright now.

06:47.474 --> 06:52.812
Mom, Dad, we'll see
you real soon. Right?

07:13.366 --> 07:15.634
I love you, baby.

07:28.648 --> 07:33.185
Buy me some peanuts and cracker, Jack.

07:33.186 --> 07:36.188
Hey, Jack, they name that after you.

07:36.189 --> 07:40.526
I don't care if I never come back.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.094
Oh, it's root,

07:42.095 --> 07:45.798
root, root for the home team.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.802
If they don't win it's a shame.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.704
'Cause it's one,

07:51.705 --> 07:55.473
two, three strikes you're out

07:55.474 --> 08:00.412
of the old ball game.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.782
Sorry Jack, I got a little
carried away there.

08:06.909 --> 08:10.488
You gonna be alright out here for a
couple of minutes by yourself, handsome?

08:10.489 --> 08:13.158
Don't be picking up any
girls when I'm not around.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.427
I get so jealous.

08:16.563 --> 08:20.199
Hey, listen honey. Listen to me.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.836
Don't be afraid. I'll be right back.

08:29.542 --> 08:32.510
Once again, the Yankees
are shut down in order.

08:32.511 --> 08:36.881
Looks like it's going
to be a long night.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.705
Looks like you got a
bad break, huh, kid?

09:09.529 --> 09:11.883
Not a big talker, huh?

09:13.613 --> 09:15.222
That's okay.

09:16.011 --> 09:17.830
You a fan?

09:18.826 --> 09:20.826
Yeah, me, too.

09:22.614 --> 09:24.927
Yeah, I got this a few years back.

09:24.928 --> 09:27.762
Been very inspiring.

09:30.206 --> 09:32.810
Still setting up in there, hmph.

09:33.210 --> 09:36.048
You ever notice doctors
are always running late?

09:36.049 --> 09:39.411
I'd have gotten fired if
I was late for my job.

09:39.812 --> 09:42.769
Hey, wanna see some magic?

09:45.352 --> 09:47.283
Ok...

09:47.320 --> 09:49.054
Jack.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.325
Your name's Jack.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.828
I knew that'd get a
reaction out of you.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.863
But I'll tell you a secret:

09:59.064 --> 10:01.266
it's written on the
underside of your cap.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.274
Well it's been great
chatting with you, Jack.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.744
Always nice to run into
a fellow Yankees fan.

10:12.745 --> 10:17.182
Too bad our boys in pinstripes gotta
lose one every now and then, huh?

10:17.483 --> 10:20.352
It's not over.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.288
Excuse me? Did you say something?

10:23.289 --> 10:26.358
It's not over... 'til it's over.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.660
Well, that's what I thought you said.

10:28.661 --> 10:32.431
That's very profound.
I believe that, too.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.968
Listen, Jack, I was thinking...

10:35.969 --> 10:40.305
if I can swing it, you wanna watch the
game while you're waiting to go in?

10:41.708 --> 10:45.110
No, I thought you
said you were a fan.

10:46.111 --> 10:48.347
I don't think there's time.

10:49.456 --> 10:52.651
World's biggest excuse.

10:52.652 --> 10:56.989
If it's important enough,
you find the time.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.692
Well, maybe we can
watch a few minutes.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.961
I was hoping you'd say that.

11:12.037 --> 11:15.941
Wait, what... What's happening!

11:16.549 --> 11:21.179
- Jack, Jack, it's fine.
- Fine. This is not fine.

11:24.939 --> 11:26.451
- We're going...
- Mom!

11:26.452 --> 11:28.387
- To watch...
- Dad!

11:28.388 --> 11:31.789
The game!

11:53.479 --> 11:55.547
Hang on, Jack!

11:56.289 --> 12:00.518
- Hang on!
- Nurse Cyndi!

12:03.909 --> 12:07.025
Help me!

12:15.068 --> 12:17.069
How did you do that?

12:17.070 --> 12:20.352
I touched my lapel pin.
Didn't you see me?

12:20.353 --> 12:23.805
But I mean how did you all of this?

12:23.906 --> 12:27.465
Like I said,
by touching my lapel pin.

12:27.466 --> 12:29.481
Boy kid, you gotta
learn to listen better.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.750
Henry!

12:31.751 --> 12:34.987
- Nolen!
- Going on another journey, I see.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.088
Henry.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.502
Is Henry taking you
to Yankee Stadium?

12:50.503 --> 12:53.372
I... I, uh, don't know.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.307
Well, you look a little strange for
someone going to a ball game.

12:56.308 --> 12:57.876
Sissy...

12:57.877 --> 12:59.845
I don't know how I got here.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.980
It's not how you got
here that's important.

13:01.981 --> 13:05.416
It's where you're going that is.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.559
Oh, no! Henry!

13:14.560 --> 13:18.196
I have to go back.
I... I... I can't do this.

13:18.197 --> 13:21.133
You can't? But you are.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.568
I mean I'm sick.

13:23.569 --> 13:26.605
I can't be around all these people.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.750
I can't leave the hospital...

13:31.329 --> 13:34.887
and I definitely can't
go to Yankee Stadium!

13:41.954 --> 13:44.856
Well, is there anything you can do?

13:44.857 --> 13:47.593
I want to go back. Now!

13:48.894 --> 13:50.907
Where's my bed?

13:51.669 --> 13:53.861
And my IV's?

13:53.866 --> 13:55.067
I can't remember.

13:55.068 --> 13:58.036
Yes, you can. You just don't want to.

13:58.037 --> 14:01.506
Now, you wanna go dressed like that,

14:01.507 --> 14:04.142
or you wanna wear
something a little less...

14:04.543 --> 14:07.312
open... in the back?

14:07.313 --> 14:10.949
- You're not listening to me.
- Sure I am.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.919
You said you can go to Yankee stadium,
you just don't want to.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.256
That's not what I... hey!

14:19.638 --> 14:21.411
What...

14:27.166 --> 14:29.167
Stop it!

14:41.414 --> 14:44.983
Don't you get it? I'm sick.

14:45.084 --> 14:47.385
I'm not supposed to he here.

14:47.986 --> 14:51.255
I'm not supposed to be anywhere.

15:09.237 --> 15:11.777
What's wrong with them?

15:11.978 --> 15:14.312
They're waiting for you to decide...

15:14.313 --> 15:18.250
what you want to do.

15:18.251 --> 15:22.020
What I want doesn't matter.

15:22.321 --> 15:26.332
What you want is the
only thing that matters.

15:26.993 --> 15:29.561
At least, in here.

15:31.235 --> 15:34.183
Jack, it's okay.

16:00.659 --> 16:03.161
Good Luck. We're all rooting for you!

16:03.162 --> 16:07.932
- Who's rooting for me?
- Everyone, silly.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.679
Let's go Yankees! Let's go Yankees!

16:54.680 --> 16:59.617
Oh, no. The Yankees are down by six!
They can't come back from this.

17:01.312 --> 17:05.373
I mean it'll be hard to come
back from that far down.

17:05.374 --> 17:08.460
Yeah, hard, but not impossible.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.162
Ah, can I see your tickets please?

17:12.189 --> 17:15.077
Oh, welcome back, sir.

17:15.078 --> 17:19.170
I didn't recognize you. Let me just
make sure your seats are ready.

17:19.171 --> 17:22.374
- They know you here?
- Yeah, well,

17:22.375 --> 17:25.109
I drop by a lot.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.378
So, you want to meet
some of the guys?

17:27.380 --> 17:30.348
- What guys?
- What guys?

17:30.349 --> 17:33.118
- The Yankees!
- Really?

17:33.119 --> 17:37.689
- Well, uh, only if you want to.
- I want to. I really want to.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.993
Right this way gentlemen. Row one.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.396
10... 9...

17:44.397 --> 17:46.798
- Keep counting, Jack.
- 8...

17:46.799 --> 17:50.234
- 7... 6...
- Ah, you're doing great.

17:50.435 --> 17:52.304
- 5...
- Alright.

17:52.305 --> 17:55.807
4... 3...

17:55.808 --> 17:58.076
2...

17:58.077 --> 18:00.745
Henry...

18:13.392 --> 18:15.727
We weren't done, yet, were we Jack?

18:15.728 --> 18:19.730
Wow... I'm back.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.847
- Big guy, isn't he?
- That guy hits like Babe Ruth.

18:37.850 --> 18:42.620
Well, he should...
because he is Babe Ruth!

18:44.957 --> 18:47.425
Well, you said you wanted
to meet some of the guys...

18:47.426 --> 18:50.195
Why isn't he wearing
his Yankees uniform?

18:50.196 --> 18:53.765
Well, he's on a barnstorming tour.
Playing in the off-season.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.734
Letting the fans get
up close and personal.

18:57.535 --> 19:03.308
Besides, it's not the uniform that makes
you a Yankee... it's what's in here.

19:03.713 --> 19:05.307
Henry!

19:05.308 --> 19:08.513
- Hey, George.
- My pal, Henry.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.682
Long time no see.

19:14.745 --> 19:17.889
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
I just got this suit pressed.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.290
Who's the kid?

19:19.291 --> 19:22.627
Well, this here is Jack.
He's a friend of mine.

19:23.228 --> 19:27.365
Hello, kid. I'm Babe Ruth.
Nice to meet you.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.669
- Can he speak?
- Well, sometimes.

19:31.770 --> 19:35.340
Doesn't matter. Any friend
of Henry's is a friend of mine.

19:35.941 --> 19:38.076
Come on kid,
you wanna take a few swings?

19:38.077 --> 19:41.346
Me? I, I can't. I, I uh...

19:41.347 --> 19:43.214
Come on, I don't want to hear that.

19:43.215 --> 19:46.451
But I've been sick and my leg,
my leg kind of hurts.

19:47.852 --> 19:52.924
I stubbed my toe yesterday
and... I'm allergic to peanuts?

19:52.925 --> 19:57.562
Allergic to peanuts?
Yeah, me, too. Right, Henry?

19:57.563 --> 20:00.265
Hey, Henry, you hear
what this kid said?

20:00.266 --> 20:04.169
Next thing's he's gonna tell me
he's allergic to hot dogs, too.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.638
Henry, we've got a lot
of work to do here...

20:06.639 --> 20:09.607
Jack, come on. Don't be afraid.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.277
What do you want to do?

20:12.278 --> 20:14.379
I want to take a few swings?

20:15.981 --> 20:18.349
Then batter up.

20:20.452 --> 20:23.220
Hey, sorry about that.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.129
There. That should do it.

20:31.130 --> 20:34.599
Hey, hey, come on, Jack.
It's light enough.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.168
Now let's see what you've got.

20:40.238 --> 20:42.384
This is so cool.

20:55.274 --> 20:58.890
- Steee-riiike!
- What are you crazy? You almost hit me!

20:58.891 --> 21:00.825
- What are you nuts?
- Hey, hey, hey.

21:00.826 --> 21:04.562
Come on kid. If you don't swing,
you're not going to hit it.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.269
- Steeee-riiike!
- What are you, crazy?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.470
Hey Jack, I don't want to bother you,

21:12.471 --> 21:15.973
but you might have better luck
if you stay in the batter's box.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.609
But the ball is coming right at me!

21:18.857 --> 21:21.012
Hey kid, remember what
the Babe tells you,

21:21.013 --> 21:24.482
if it was easy,
it wouldn't be worth doing.

21:24.483 --> 21:27.456
- Stay with it, Jack! Come on now.
- You can do it!

21:27.457 --> 21:30.892
- Come on kid, get in there!
- Come on, Jack. You can do it!

21:31.524 --> 21:32.924
- Atta boy!
- You can do it Jack!

21:32.925 --> 21:35.526
We're rooting for you, Jack.

21:37.056 --> 21:41.566
Steeee-riike 3! You're out!

21:46.004 --> 21:50.174
See. I told you I couldn't do it.

21:51.056 --> 21:54.204
Okay. That's 'cause you're
doing three things wrong.

21:54.205 --> 21:57.014
Number one, you're playing it safe.

21:57.015 --> 21:59.651
Two, you gotta lay back
on the curve ball,

21:59.652 --> 22:04.589
and three, you gotta believe you can
do it or you're never gonna hit one.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.219
Let's start with number 1.

22:07.220 --> 22:10.995
When you swing, swing like
your whole life depends on it.

22:10.996 --> 22:16.901
Make it the biggest, best, most powerful
swing you can come up with. Okay?

22:17.505 --> 22:21.682
Number 2, see how he's spinning
the ball in his hand like that?

22:21.683 --> 22:26.410
He's tipping his pitch. He only
does that before he throws a curve.

22:26.411 --> 22:29.646
And you know what to
do with a curve, right?

22:32.283 --> 22:35.420
You lay back on it. And number 3,

22:35.421 --> 22:38.856
the most important... you,

22:39.057 --> 22:43.595
Jack, gotta believe you can do it.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.542
Pitchers hate it when I point.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.477
- You know why?
- Why?

22:59.478 --> 23:03.748
'Cause it tells them I believe I'm
gonna hit it all the way out there.

23:03.749 --> 23:08.719
Just believing you can do it,
Jack, can change the game.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.125
Man!

23:20.799 --> 23:24.969
- You still got it, George!
- That's amazing.

23:26.484 --> 23:30.274
- I can never do that.
- Okay, you're turn.

23:30.275 --> 23:33.338
Come on, Jack, give it a ride.

23:36.003 --> 23:38.716
- Steee-riiiike 1!
- I can't do it!

23:38.717 --> 23:42.720
Alright, alright. Time out,
time out. Come here.

23:43.221 --> 23:45.756
You gotta believe.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.599
You!

24:00.739 --> 24:03.107
Go ahead, laugh guys, laugh.

24:11.516 --> 24:15.519
Come on, Jack, they can
tell your heart's not in it.

24:22.227 --> 24:23.561
Come on, Jack. You can do it.

24:23.562 --> 24:26.062
- Come on, Jack.
- Let's Go!

24:26.063 --> 24:28.266
Come on Jack, you can do it!

24:29.608 --> 24:31.051
Yes.

24:39.856 --> 24:43.848
- Now that's what I'm talking about.
- I did it. I really did it.

24:43.849 --> 24:45.883
Boy, did you ever.

24:45.884 --> 24:49.754
Did you see that? That ball
went over six hundred feet.

24:49.755 --> 24:52.323
How do you like that fellas, huh?
You see my boy?

24:52.819 --> 24:55.025
I did it. That was me.

24:55.728 --> 24:59.463
- Hey, Henry, what do you think?
- Told you he had it in him.

25:00.051 --> 25:01.732
That was me.

25:02.233 --> 25:03.901
He's quite a kid.

25:03.902 --> 25:07.839
You were right, Henry. He may not
look it, but boy I'm tellin' you,

25:07.840 --> 25:10.108
that kid's made of steel.

25:11.916 --> 25:13.935
I did it.

25:15.490 --> 25:18.549
Right over the silo. It was amazing!

25:18.550 --> 25:22.987
Remember kid. There's heroes,
and there's legends.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.691
Heroes get remembered but legends...

25:27.838 --> 25:29.319
never die.

25:30.020 --> 25:31.928
Hop in slugger.

25:33.071 --> 25:36.328
Goodbye, Mr. Ruth,
I'll never forget you.

25:36.329 --> 25:37.802
I'll be looking out for you.

25:38.203 --> 25:41.372
Okay, Jack... we've gotta get going.
We don't wanna be late.

25:41.473 --> 25:44.575
- Late for what?
- Late for practice.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.811
- Well, see 'ya George!
- It's good to see you, Henry.

25:46.812 --> 25:49.665
Watch out for the suit, Ge... Geo.

25:50.048 --> 25:54.051
So long, Jack. Remember,
Don't stop believing.

25:54.578 --> 25:56.223
Shall we?

26:02.828 --> 26:05.463
You got me, Henry!

26:05.464 --> 26:08.799
<i>...famous streak</i>
<i>that's got us all aglow</i>

26:08.800 --> 26:13.304
<i>He's just a man not a freak,</i>
<i>Joltin' Joe DiMaggio</i>

26:13.305 --> 26:14.672
You did good back there.

26:14.673 --> 26:18.910
That was so cool.
I still can't believe it.

26:20.337 --> 26:24.782
I mean, I can believe it,
it's just hard to imagine.

26:37.363 --> 26:40.298
<i>The top of the sixth.</i>
<i>Yankees trailing 8-2.</i>

26:40.299 --> 26:43.133
<i>This hill's getting harder</i>
<i>and harder to climb.</i>

26:43.134 --> 26:46.137
<i>Yes, it is, Michael. Yes, it is.</i>

26:46.238 --> 26:49.740
<i>The final game of the season.</i>
<i>Win and the Yankees go to the playoffs.</i>

26:49.741 --> 26:54.345
<i>Lose, and it's a long winter</i>
<i>of what could have been.</i>

26:54.346 --> 26:56.848
What do you think, Jack.
The Yanks have a chance?

26:56.849 --> 26:58.724
Sure.

26:58.725 --> 27:01.452
Maybe. I guess.

27:02.053 --> 27:06.557
Well, if you say it long enough,
you'll start to believe it.

27:14.856 --> 27:16.801
This car can fly?

27:16.802 --> 27:18.836
Fasten your seat belts, Jack!

27:18.837 --> 27:21.472
It can fly!

27:36.888 --> 27:39.490
This is totally awesome!

27:47.232 --> 27:49.233
Hello down there!

27:52.685 --> 27:54.578
Yeah!

28:22.067 --> 28:26.270
- That was amazing.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

28:26.271 --> 28:31.042
Hey Henry, isn't this the old stadium?
I thought it was gone.

28:32.072 --> 28:35.846
Well it is. But, its memories, Jack.

28:35.847 --> 28:37.882
They live forever.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.885
- What do ya say we go in?
- Yeah.

28:42.330 --> 28:44.190
It's like a museum in here.

28:44.191 --> 28:47.925
A museum? You ever seen a
museum with real people in it?

28:47.926 --> 28:51.649
Is that... are those... are they...?

28:51.650 --> 28:55.834
Ah, they drop by to play a
little ball from time to time.

28:55.835 --> 29:00.471
You know, once you're a Yankee,
you always have a home here.

29:00.472 --> 29:03.908
Wow! Mickey Mantle.

29:05.019 --> 29:07.371
Do you mind?

29:10.949 --> 29:12.883
Sorry.

29:15.784 --> 29:18.095
Sorry kid... I'm just
messing with you.

29:18.096 --> 29:23.293
Lefty, this is Jack.
Jack, Lefty Gomez.

29:23.294 --> 29:27.064
One of the best Yankee
pitchers of all time.

29:29.167 --> 29:31.502
Gotta be quicker than that if
you want to make the team.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.837
Make the team?

29:32.838 --> 29:37.308
- Hm, you sure he can throw?
- One way to find out.

29:38.625 --> 29:43.514
Oh, boy, again? Can I have a warning
next time before you do that.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.516
Ah, you'll get used to it.

29:45.517 --> 29:49.186
Now, let's see what you've got.

29:49.187 --> 29:51.822
You want me to pitch from here.

29:53.382 --> 29:56.135
But, I've never pitched
from this far before.

29:56.136 --> 30:00.431
And I've never sung opera. But you
don't see that stopping me, do you?

30:00.432 --> 30:02.933
<i>La Donna Mobile!</i>

30:02.934 --> 30:05.536
<i>La Donna Mobile!</i>

30:05.537 --> 30:08.139
<i>La Donna Mobile!</i>

30:08.140 --> 30:11.041
<i>La Donna Mobile...</i>

30:12.442 --> 30:16.782
How will you know if you're
any good unless you try?

30:16.783 --> 30:19.884
Oh, you tried, alright... Pavarotti.

30:19.885 --> 30:24.288
Oh, look what the cat dragged in,
my biggest critic, Bobby Ray Murcer.

30:24.289 --> 30:27.257
- Listen, Mr. Gomez...
- Whoa, time out.

30:27.258 --> 30:30.259
Time, time, time. Please...

30:30.360 --> 30:33.063
call me El Goofy.

30:33.764 --> 30:37.001
Mr. Goofy, I'm not so
sure this is a good idea.

30:37.402 --> 30:42.039
So, you're not so sure
it's not either. Right?

30:42.040 --> 30:45.478
So, let's get it on. Here we go.

30:45.994 --> 30:49.580
Alright, come on, give him
some signs here! Not that sign.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.949
Nod your head so he
knows you understand.

30:51.950 --> 30:54.185
- But I don't understand.
- He understands.

30:54.186 --> 30:58.055
Alright, he got the sign. Okay.
Show him the curve ball.

30:58.056 --> 31:00.557
But I don't know how
to throw a curve ball.

31:00.558 --> 31:02.559
It's easy.

31:06.264 --> 31:08.030
Arm back,

31:10.942 --> 31:12.803
and throw!

31:28.220 --> 31:33.190
- Come on Jack!
- Give 'em the curve ball.

31:41.533 --> 31:44.571
Yeah, Lefty. Piece of cake.

31:44.572 --> 31:47.305
Listen, are you sure you're
serious about baseball?

31:47.306 --> 31:53.243
- Yes. Very serious.
- That's your problem. He's too serious.

31:53.244 --> 31:56.647
I wanna explain, okay. You choke the
ball between your thumb and pointer.

31:56.648 --> 31:59.568
Cock the wrist like this, okay.
Then you snap it down hard...

31:59.569 --> 32:03.120
so that the ball rolls out of your hand
like a river going down a waterfall.

32:03.121 --> 32:04.721
You got that.

32:04.722 --> 32:06.957
You grab the ball like this.

32:06.958 --> 32:10.060
Then... throw it into the river?

32:10.061 --> 32:13.964
No, no, it's, you,
you turn your wrist,

32:13.965 --> 32:17.434
- while you go over the waterfall...
- He's got it.

32:17.435 --> 32:21.137
Mr. Goofy, sir, could
you show me again?

32:21.138 --> 32:24.274
Look, Jack... it's all
about enjoying yourself,

32:24.275 --> 32:26.410
even when you're down in the count.

32:27.011 --> 32:29.780
Yeah, enjoy myself.

32:30.215 --> 32:32.516
Now you're getting it. I like that.

32:32.917 --> 32:34.417
Relax.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.622
Now let's see what you got.

32:43.295 --> 32:46.296
Come on Jack! You got this!

33:03.014 --> 33:07.284
Henry... are you kidding me?

33:15.099 --> 33:17.246
Thurman Munson?

33:18.362 --> 33:23.757
Okay, Jack. Remember. This next
guy can hit just about anything.

33:23.803 --> 33:27.637
<i>Now batting, the center fielder,</i>

33:27.838 --> 33:29.706
<i>number 7,</i>

33:29.707 --> 33:33.742
<i>Mickey Mantle, number 7.</i>

33:36.445 --> 33:37.723
No way.

33:37.724 --> 33:41.852
You want me to pitch
to Mickey Mantle?

33:42.253 --> 33:44.088
No, I want you to dance for him.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.457
Of course I want you to
pitch to Mickey Mantle.

33:46.458 --> 33:51.295
But Mr. Munson, I'm not
really a pitcher. I'm just a kid.

33:51.296 --> 33:56.467
He doesn't know that. All he knows
is you've got a crazy curve ball.

33:57.168 --> 34:00.201
Now what do you say
we show it to 'im?

34:02.074 --> 34:03.710
Come on, Jack!

34:05.311 --> 34:09.813
I don't know. Maybe you
should bring in somebody else.

34:10.014 --> 34:13.484
Someone with more ex.. experience.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.319
So you're telling me

34:15.320 --> 34:19.322
there's something you'd rather be doing
than trying to strike out Mickey Mantle.

34:19.424 --> 34:23.327
- Mr. Munson...
- Hey, kid. Listen close.

34:23.328 --> 34:25.829
Remember what Lefty taught you.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.498
- Relax..
- That's right.

34:28.498 --> 34:29.500
Have fun.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.603
It's a game kid.
It's supposed to be fun.

34:32.603 --> 34:36.706
Dr. Acosta. Something's not right.
His pressure is dropping.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.475
I don't know.

34:40.003 --> 34:41.938
I don't feel well.

34:42.340 --> 34:46.417
You gotta take these opportunities
when they come to you, kid.

34:47.217 --> 34:50.277
'Cause you never know what
tomorrow's gonna bring.

34:51.388 --> 34:54.725
- BP down to 65!
- No, wait. Hang on.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.793
- Down to 60!
- Please, Jack.

34:56.793 --> 34:59.496
Come on, Honey. Fight. Come on kid.

34:59.497 --> 35:02.099
- Pressure down to 55!
- You can do this.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.369
You can do this, Jack. Come on, Jack.

35:07.593 --> 35:10.689
Fight, Jack! Fight!

35:16.147 --> 35:19.349
<i>Lying in my bed</i>

35:19.350 --> 35:25.320
<i>I hear the clock tick</i>
<i>and think of you</i>

35:25.921 --> 35:29.793
<i>Caught up in circles</i>

35:29.794 --> 35:34.865
<i>Confusion is nothing new</i>

35:35.766 --> 35:40.003
<i>Flashback, warm nights</i>

35:40.004 --> 35:43.873
<i>Almost left behind</i>

35:44.574 --> 35:49.574
<i>Suitcase of memories</i>

35:49.947 --> 35:55.886
<i>Time after</i>
<i>Sometimes you picture me</i>

35:55.887 --> 36:01.354
<i>I'm walking too far ahead</i>

36:01.755 --> 36:05.162
<i>You're calling to me</i>

36:05.163 --> 36:10.267
<i>I can't hear what you've said.</i>

36:10.268 --> 36:15.906
<i>Then you say go slow</i>

36:16.607 --> 36:19.676
<i>I fall behind</i>

36:21.177 --> 36:24.904
<i>The second hand unwinds</i>

36:24.905 --> 36:30.921
<i>If you're lost you can look</i>
<i>and you will find me</i>

36:31.022 --> 36:34.124
<i>Time after time</i>

36:34.125 --> 36:37.093
<i>If you fall I will catch you</i>

36:37.094 --> 36:40.230
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

36:40.231 --> 36:43.434
<i>Time after time</i>

36:43.435 --> 36:49.540
<i>If you're lost you can look</i>
<i>and you will find me</i>

36:49.541 --> 36:53.277
<i>Time after time</i>

36:53.278 --> 36:56.379
<i>If you fall I will catch you</i>

36:56.380 --> 37:01.648
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

37:02.420 --> 37:07.723
<i>Ohh, time after time</i>

37:09.224 --> 37:12.668
<i>Time after time</i>

37:12.769 --> 37:18.268
<i>I've got a suitcase of memories</i>

37:18.269 --> 37:22.906
<i>I almost left behind</i>

37:29.480 --> 37:31.847
Do you miss your mom and dad?

37:34.369 --> 37:36.201
Everyday.

37:41.893 --> 37:44.394
Come on, Sissy. Let's go!

37:44.395 --> 37:46.196
You're up!

37:48.297 --> 37:53.003
Remember, Jack.
We're all rooting for you.

38:05.348 --> 38:09.053
Jack. Jack.

38:09.454 --> 38:13.523
Listen. Just listen to your heart.

38:13.624 --> 38:17.794
Come on, Jack. Pull through. Come on.

38:19.495 --> 38:24.001
Come on, now. Come on, Jack.

38:24.602 --> 38:28.019
Well, what's it going to be, Jack.

38:29.573 --> 38:32.242
- That's it.
- Heart rate's coming back.

38:32.243 --> 38:35.612
There. Way to go, Jack.

38:35.713 --> 38:39.683
Thank God. He's back
ladies and gentlemen.

38:39.684 --> 38:42.086
Good work, Doctor. He's back.

38:42.587 --> 38:46.456
Hey, Jack, are you in or are you out?

38:46.457 --> 38:50.327
I'm in. Let's strike this joker out.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.963
Okay, break it up you two.
Let's get back to the game.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.232
I'm not sure I'd be
calling Mantle a joker,

38:55.233 --> 38:58.468
but now you're starting
to sound like a Yankee.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.544
Who's the kid?

39:07.545 --> 39:09.513
You're about to find out.

39:09.514 --> 39:12.716
Yeah, alright. We'll see.

39:13.617 --> 39:16.987
Okay. Relax. And have some fun.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.191
Come on, Jack. Come on.

39:19.621 --> 39:23.473
Come on, Jack, Put it right in there.
You know what to do.

39:31.769 --> 39:35.004
Steeer-iiike 1!

39:35.105 --> 39:39.476
- That was nasty.
- You're in for it, Mick.

39:40.681 --> 39:43.013
- Okay. One down.
- You can do it.

39:43.014 --> 39:45.549
One more, Jack. One more time.
Just like that.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.784
You can do it, Jack. Come on.

39:47.785 --> 39:51.154
- I can do this.
- Yeah, okay. Show me.

39:58.296 --> 40:02.666
- Steeeer-iiiike 2!
- That kid is filthy!

40:03.698 --> 40:06.069
Come on, Jack. Let's go home.
Let's do this, Jack.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.506
One more! One more!
Just one more, Jack!

40:10.676 --> 40:13.005
I can do this.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.649
No.

40:20.350 --> 40:22.284
It's up to you, Jack.

40:25.713 --> 40:28.397
Mariano is set.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.253
Good night, Mick.

40:55.720 --> 40:59.455
You're out!

41:08.399 --> 41:10.834
That's my boy! Right there!

41:11.980 --> 41:14.033
Hey, Henry!

41:15.123 --> 41:17.238
We did it!

41:18.639 --> 41:20.408
Yeah!

41:37.161 --> 41:40.030
Hey, buddy. You've got
quite an arm there.

41:40.031 --> 41:43.967
- Mr. Steinbrenner.
- I think I can use you on the team.

41:43.968 --> 41:46.636
- Really?
- What do you think, Reggie?

41:46.937 --> 41:49.372
This kid's really good
in the clutch, man.

41:49.373 --> 41:52.242
Comin' from him that's
a real compliment.

41:52.243 --> 41:56.679
Reggie was great in the clutch
especially when it really mattered.

41:57.531 --> 41:59.850
- What are you talking about, Yogi?
- Hey, Yogi, come on, now.

41:59.851 --> 42:04.888
It's true. He gave a hundred percent,
a hundred and ten percent of the time.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.990
A hundred and ten.

42:08.726 --> 42:12.262
What Yogi's trying to say is that
when everything seems lost...

42:12.363 --> 42:14.998
That's the time to turn up your game.

42:14.999 --> 42:19.135
That's right, Goose.
Be a winner, Jack. Be a winner.

42:19.136 --> 42:23.473
Remember Jack. Be the curly
straw that stirs the drink.

42:23.474 --> 42:27.844
Be the straw, Jack. Be the straw.

42:29.145 --> 42:32.117
Yeah, sure, Reg. But listen, son.

42:32.118 --> 42:34.951
You're gonna have to start at the
bottom and work your way up.

42:34.952 --> 42:37.287
Like somebody famous once said,

42:37.288 --> 42:40.724
"If it was easy,
it wouldn't be worth doing."

42:41.025 --> 42:43.059
- I know.
- Good.

42:45.407 --> 42:48.942
Now go out there and make me proud.

42:48.943 --> 42:51.668
Yes sir. I will.

43:11.741 --> 43:13.757
No way.

43:15.239 --> 43:18.260
Hey, little man. You look great.

43:18.261 --> 43:19.361
Thanks.

43:22.940 --> 43:24.481
So cool.

43:24.482 --> 43:27.837
Granderson steps back in with
the Yankees down by five.

43:27.838 --> 43:30.440
Come on, CG. Here we go, man.
Bases loaded, bro.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.676
- Come on, Curtis. You can do this.
- Come on, one-four. You can do it.

43:32.677 --> 43:34.577
Here we go! Here we go!

43:34.578 --> 43:38.248
The pitch... Granderson hits a
ground ball into the hole at short...

43:38.249 --> 43:42.986
What a diving stop by the shortstop...
he gets to his feet, throws... safe!

43:42.987 --> 43:44.821
Yeah, baby! I got it!

43:44.822 --> 43:49.592
Oh, what hustle by Curtis!
The Yankees now trail 10-6.

43:49.593 --> 43:52.362
Hey, to all you kids out there,
that's how you play the game.

43:52.363 --> 43:54.330
Right there. That's how
you play the game.

43:54.331 --> 43:56.967
Hey, we need you on base, Tex.
Let's go. Come on, Come on, let's go.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.702
Come on Tex, big at bat, right here.

43:58.703 --> 44:00.770
You, twenty five.
Two Five, let's go Tex.

44:00.771 --> 44:04.227
Teixera steps in as the tying run.

44:06.425 --> 44:09.646
Teixera broke his bat on that one.
More kindling for the fire.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.414
- Teixera needs a new bat.
- What?

44:11.415 --> 44:14.985
Tex broke his bat. Get him
another one. And move it.

44:15.286 --> 44:17.454
Oh, Okay. Got it! Got it!

44:17.555 --> 44:20.657
Well, wouldn't you know it.
It would all come down to this.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.459
Bottom of the ninth, 2 outs,
bases full of Yankees

44:23.460 --> 44:26.396
and a 2-strike count on Mark Teixera.

44:26.497 --> 44:29.465
It doesn't get any better
than this, does it Michael?

44:29.466 --> 44:32.468
Well, here comes the bat boy
with another piece of lumber.

44:32.469 --> 44:35.771
Maybe this one has some magic in it.

44:39.476 --> 44:40.610
Yes.

44:40.611 --> 44:42.812
Come on, baby. What do
you say, Tex. Let's do it baby.

44:42.813 --> 44:45.481
- Come on, Tex. Get on base.
- Come on, Tex. Big at bat.

44:45.482 --> 44:48.056
Come on Tex, come on kid.
Come on 2-5. You're right on it, baby.

44:48.057 --> 44:51.921
Tex, hey, we need one in the right field
seats, Tex. Big hit here. Let's go, Tex.

44:51.922 --> 44:54.824
They really think they can win.

44:54.825 --> 44:57.727
They don't think it. They know it.

44:57.728 --> 45:01.231
Here's the pitch, he lines
a base hit to right field.

45:01.232 --> 45:05.735
That scores Cano and the
Yankees are now down ten-seven.

45:10.774 --> 45:12.274
Jack,

45:16.213 --> 45:20.450
These are the moments we live for.

45:20.451 --> 45:24.921
Hideki Matsui steps to the plate
hoping to change everything

45:24.922 --> 45:26.956
in one single swing.

45:27.557 --> 45:29.225
Come on, Matsu. Come on baby.

45:29.226 --> 45:31.194
Here's the pitch,

45:31.195 --> 45:34.864
- cut on and missed.
- Steeeee-rike 1!

45:34.865 --> 45:37.333
Hey, that curve's been
tying him up all night.

45:37.334 --> 45:40.136
I want to see 500 feet, baby.
A gigantic one.

45:40.137 --> 45:44.273
Matty, we need you right now PacMan. This
is what you do best, picking up them RBIs.

45:44.274 --> 45:46.642
You got this!

45:48.437 --> 45:51.447
See how he's spinning the ball
in his hand like that, Jack.

45:51.448 --> 45:57.370
He's tipping his pitch. He only
does that before he throws a curve.

45:57.855 --> 46:00.321
And here's the 0-1,

46:01.224 --> 46:03.157
Steeee-rike 2!

46:04.495 --> 46:07.230
Hey, guys, look. Look.

46:07.231 --> 46:10.233
He's tipping his pitch.
He's tipping his pitch.

46:10.234 --> 46:12.101
Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about baby.

46:12.702 --> 46:14.370
I got to tell him.

46:14.371 --> 46:16.039
It's you now, it's you.

46:16.040 --> 46:19.008
Now he comes set to the belt...

46:24.315 --> 46:28.671
Just believing you can do it,
Jack, can change the game.

46:28.919 --> 46:31.119
Let's go Yankees!

46:32.622 --> 46:34.657
Let's go Yankees!

46:34.658 --> 46:37.493
Excuse me, Mr. Matsui.

46:37.494 --> 46:39.762
Hey, what's the kid doing?

46:41.634 --> 46:46.202
It looks like Matsui is being
told something by the bat boy.

46:46.203 --> 46:49.439
I wonder what they
could be talking about.

46:49.440 --> 46:54.154
- Hey, kid, what did you say to him?
- Something that Babe taught me.

46:56.796 --> 46:59.401
The Yankees are down
to their last strike.

46:59.550 --> 47:01.484
Hey, hit one in the seats, let's go.

47:01.785 --> 47:04.685
Now, Matsui digs back in.

47:06.631 --> 47:10.226
I'm feeling the pie, Jack.
I'm feeling the pie, Jack.

47:10.227 --> 47:13.562
Come on, we've done it all year long.

47:21.338 --> 47:22.872
Yes!

47:38.389 --> 47:40.523
There it goes. Deep Center.

47:42.059 --> 47:46.496
It is high, it is far, it is gone!

47:46.497 --> 47:48.998
Into Monument Park.

47:48.999 --> 47:51.601
- Yeah.
- Yeah, baby!

47:51.602 --> 47:54.971
A thriller by Godzilla.

47:54.972 --> 47:55.771
We win!

47:55.972 --> 48:00.409
Game over. Regular Season Over.
Yankees win!

48:00.510 --> 48:04.210
The Yankees win!

48:05.348 --> 48:08.220
And the Yankees are now
headed to the playoffs.

48:08.221 --> 48:10.019
What do you think
about that, Michael?

48:10.020 --> 48:12.688
Well, it looks like mystique and
aura have crossed the street

48:12.689 --> 48:15.124
and now live here at the
House that George built.

48:16.660 --> 48:18.427
<i>Omedetou</i> Jack!

48:20.658 --> 48:22.714
<i>Omedetou!</i>

48:45.923 --> 48:48.724
I bet you never thought
you could do all that.

48:48.725 --> 48:51.194
Not in a million years.

48:51.195 --> 48:53.796
Hey, Henry, can I meet some
of the other guys like...

48:53.797 --> 48:58.534
Joe Dimaggio or, or Roger Maris?
Or Billy Martin?

48:58.535 --> 49:01.537
Well, maybe some other time.

49:01.538 --> 49:03.906
Right now...

49:03.907 --> 49:05.875
it's time to go home.

49:06.176 --> 49:10.346
But I don't want to go home.
I want to stay here.

49:10.347 --> 49:13.167
Look, I have hair.

49:14.250 --> 49:16.886
No tubes. I can move.

49:16.887 --> 49:21.524
And I can hit home runs
and throw curve balls.

49:22.025 --> 49:25.328
I'm not tired anymore.

49:25.329 --> 49:29.732
Can't I just stay here a little
bit longer? I just got here.

49:29.833 --> 49:33.236
Sorry, Jack.
That's not the way it works.

49:33.237 --> 49:36.405
And what about the team?
They need me.

49:36.406 --> 49:40.209
There's another team that
needs you even more.

49:40.510 --> 49:45.314
That's not fair.
I'm not ready to go yet.

49:45.315 --> 49:47.517
I can't...

49:47.518 --> 49:50.319
I just can't.

50:16.180 --> 50:18.280
Jack?

50:22.031 --> 50:23.903
Jack?

50:24.542 --> 50:26.440
Are you in there?

50:33.730 --> 50:36.764
Yeah, of course.

50:44.007 --> 50:46.743
I'm not ready to go, Henry.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.612
I see you found my chair.

50:49.613 --> 50:52.315
Leave me alone.

50:52.316 --> 50:55.885
You know, when I was scared,

50:55.886 --> 50:58.353
I used to come in here, too.

50:58.354 --> 51:03.359
I'd sit in that exact
chair and wait...

51:03.360 --> 51:07.363
until I felt strong enough
to face the world.

51:07.364 --> 51:09.950
What did you have to be scared about?

51:09.951 --> 51:15.601
Oh, I've got a few monsters
in my closet, too.

51:15.839 --> 51:19.742
But the way I see it,
you have two choices...

51:20.210 --> 51:23.279
either you hide from them,

51:23.280 --> 51:26.282
or you step up and face them.

51:27.728 --> 51:29.717
Head on.

51:30.786 --> 51:33.413
Come here, I want to
show you something.

51:33.457 --> 51:39.194
Okay, you wanted a warning, here's your
warning. I'm about to touch my pin.

51:56.180 --> 52:00.082
You mean you're Lou Gehrig?

52:00.783 --> 52:03.152
At your service.

52:04.289 --> 52:10.237
Fans, for the past two weeks you've
been reading about the bad break I got.

52:10.661 --> 52:14.997
Yet today I consider myself...

52:14.998 --> 52:19.068
the luckiest man on
the face of this earth.

52:20.660 --> 52:22.702
How did you do it?

52:23.106 --> 52:26.042
You were just as sick as I am.

52:26.043 --> 52:29.411
How did you keep playing every day?

52:29.512 --> 52:31.936
I'm a Yankee, Jack.

52:32.649 --> 52:35.250
That's what we do.

53:00.577 --> 53:02.912
Okay, Henry.

53:02.913 --> 53:05.947
I'm ready.

53:18.595 --> 53:21.731
What a brave kid, guys?

53:21.732 --> 53:24.734
That kid's got a lot
of Yankee in him.

53:24.735 --> 53:26.968
Of course he does.

53:29.876 --> 53:31.992
'Cause he believes.

53:39.649 --> 53:42.385
He sure does.

53:53.697 --> 53:55.598
Honey?

53:55.599 --> 53:58.834
Jack? Can you hear me?

53:58.835 --> 54:02.872
Hey sport. The doctor
said everything went well.

54:02.873 --> 54:07.109
Now all we need you
to do is wake up, okay?

54:13.016 --> 54:15.150
We were so worried.

54:21.358 --> 54:25.361
Don't worry, Jackie. You'll never
have to go through this again.

54:25.362 --> 54:27.996
I can if I have to.

54:31.368 --> 54:33.769
Dad. He tipped his pitch.

54:33.770 --> 54:34.937
What?

54:34.938 --> 54:37.907
Matsui. He knew it was
going to be a curve.

54:37.908 --> 54:40.810
- How on earth did you...
- Excuse me, Jack.

54:40.811 --> 54:45.167
How you doing, Sport? You're looking good.
Listen, I found some people out here...

54:45.168 --> 54:48.317
roaming the halls saying they want
to visit. Should I send them in?

54:48.318 --> 54:52.187
I don't think this is a good time.
Maybe if you all could, could just...

54:52.920 --> 54:55.224
- Big guy.
- Mariano!

54:55.225 --> 54:58.162
- Should we come back later?
- No! Now is great!

54:58.163 --> 54:59.651
What's going on,
buddy, how you doing?

54:59.652 --> 55:01.831
Hey, Jack. What's going on buddy.
How you feeling, man?

55:01.832 --> 55:04.233
Like that hat. Love you're
showing the colors.

55:04.234 --> 55:05.637
Would you like us to sign it?

55:05.638 --> 55:08.599
No, he's not really comfortable
taking it off in front of...

55:08.600 --> 55:10.300
Here.

55:10.707 --> 55:13.376
There's nothing wrong
with a good looking dome.

55:13.377 --> 55:16.145
But don't worry kid,
it'll all come back.

55:16.146 --> 55:19.555
- I hear you're a big fan.
- Yeah! The biggest!

55:19.556 --> 55:21.953
You're doctor told us
you're one brave kid.

55:21.954 --> 55:25.327
I've had my eye on this
one for a long time guys.

55:25.328 --> 55:28.391
He definitely has what
it takes to be a Yankee.

55:28.392 --> 55:33.058
And you know, Jack,
once a Yankee, always a Yankee.

55:36.090 --> 55:39.711
You know, you look
really familiar to me.

55:39.712 --> 55:41.103
Yeah, me, too.

55:41.104 --> 55:43.873
Now that you mention it,
have we met before?

55:43.874 --> 55:45.211
- Hey, boys.
- Hi, Boss.

55:45.212 --> 55:48.210
- How ya doing, Mr. Steinbrenner.
- Mr. Steinbrenner!

55:48.211 --> 55:49.779
You got the Boss here.

55:49.780 --> 55:52.685
- How are you, Jack?
- I'm great.

55:52.686 --> 55:56.421
Listen, the whole team...
we're real proud of you,

55:56.422 --> 55:59.413
so we wanted to give
you a little something.

56:00.519 --> 56:05.594
This is to certify that Jack
has earned the right...

56:05.595 --> 56:09.298
to be called a New York Yankee.

56:09.299 --> 56:11.367
For me.

56:12.368 --> 56:13.669
Yes.

56:13.670 --> 56:18.240
I got mine a few years back
and it's been very inspiring.

56:18.241 --> 56:20.743
Hey Regg... how do
I get one of those?

56:20.744 --> 56:26.348
Hit 3 bombs in a World Series game,
and maybe we'll talk.

56:27.684 --> 56:31.053
- Man, he got you, Tex.
- Tex, that's cold, man.

56:31.754 --> 56:34.956
Mark, just don't strike out as much.

56:36.660 --> 56:38.126
Man!

56:38.327 --> 56:42.731
Go ahead. That's right. Pile on.
I'm used to carrying you, anyway.

56:43.066 --> 56:46.101
Yeah, yeah.
That's right Reg, thank you.

56:52.776 --> 56:54.410
Hey, Jack!

56:54.811 --> 56:57.179
That's what I'm talking about.

56:58.080 --> 57:02.195
Remember... live as big as you can.

57:02.896 --> 57:04.518
You made it, Jack.

57:07.289 --> 57:09.856
Enjoy every minute of it.

57:15.265 --> 57:18.867
Watch out for the suit, George.
George, not the suit!

59:16.152 --> 59:20.743
"Henry and Me"
is dedicated to the Boss,

59:20.957 --> 59:25.694
George M. Steinbrenner III.

59:45.415 --> 59:48.417
Boss, you ready?

59:49.718 --> 59:53.258
Okay, Henry, I'm ready.

59:54.533 --> 59:59.728
Henry, you drive.
Babe, get in the back.

01:00:00.503 --> 01:00:03.698
For you, Boss, my pleasure.
