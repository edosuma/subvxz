00:02.235 --> 00:05.068
I find it fascinating, when you go
in the stationery store...

00:06.639 --> 00:09.199
...that they're manufacturing
millions of pens constantly.

00:09.376 --> 00:12.971
We're all buying them. I must have
bought 6000 Bics in my life.

00:13.146 --> 00:16.239
I've used up maybe two of them.
Where's the rest of them?

00:16.416 --> 00:18.384
Move a refrigerator,
there's a couple there.

00:18.551 --> 00:22.851
But that doesn't account for it.
Where are all the pens?

00:23.023 --> 00:25.287
That's why it's embarrassing
if you don't have one.

00:25.458 --> 00:28.689
"You got a pen? Can I borrow a pen?"
We always have to whisper...

00:28.862 --> 00:32.229
...because it's so humiliating.
"l don't have a pen."

00:32.564 --> 00:34.556
"They're making millions
of them every week."

00:34.734 --> 00:37.032
"l know. Where are they?"

00:43.977 --> 00:45.444
May I help you?

00:45.612 --> 00:49.207
Yeah, hi.
I'm looking for a Rolamech 1000.

00:49.382 --> 00:54.718
-It's a mechanical pencil.
-Oh, I know the Rolamech 1000.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.758
No, I'm sure you do.

00:58.925 --> 01:00.916
They're pretty expensive.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.085
Well, it's for my boss.

01:03.263 --> 01:04.753
What do you do?

01:06.566 --> 01:07.897
Whatever.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.059
Well, we don't have any
in stock right now...

01:10.236 --> 01:12.704
...but I would be happy
to order it for you.

01:12.872 --> 01:14.806
Just give me your phone number...

01:14.974 --> 01:17.772
...and when it comes in,
I'll give you a call.

01:17.944 --> 01:19.605
Your name is...?

01:19.779 --> 01:21.246
Elaine.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.314
Elaine.

01:25.151 --> 01:29.451
-And your last name?
-It's just Elaine. Like Cher.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.118
And your number?

01:34.294 --> 01:39.322
It's KL5-2390.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.759
Okay. Thanks a lot.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.132
-You'll be hearing from me.
-Okay. So long.

01:45.305 --> 01:48.604
-Why did you give him my number?
-Don't worry about it.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.771
I think he got ideas.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.107
I wonder if any woman
ever said that about Einstein.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.941
Just call me when
the pencil comes in.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.550
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer
a pencil to a pen anyway?

01:59.385 --> 02:00.647
Hey, look who's here.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.811
Hey.

02:04.524 --> 02:06.116
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hi, Julie.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.554
Elaine, Julie.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.059
-Hi.
-Oh, hi. Elaine's my middle name.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.494
Mine's Ike.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.195
Hey, wanna get some lunch?

02:15.368 --> 02:17.632
Just had a big bowl of Kix.

02:18.738 --> 02:20.296
Oh, well, that's very mature.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.338
-What about you?
-Oh, please come, Elaine.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.568
No. Maybe you could
bring me back something.

02:24.744 --> 02:28.339
-Sure, all right. What do you want?
-I don't know.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.415
-A big salad.
-What big salad?

02:30.583 --> 02:33.051
-I'm going to the coffee shop.
-They have big salads.

02:33.219 --> 02:34.982
I've never seen a big salad.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.417
They have big salads.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.491
Is that what I ask for,
the big salad?

02:41.361 --> 02:43.556
-It's okay. Just forget it.
-No, hey, I'll get it.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.664
What's in the big salad?

02:45.832 --> 02:50.098
Big lettuce, big carrots.
Tomatoes like volleyballs.

02:50.403 --> 02:52.769
So you gonna be upstairs?
See you in a little while.

02:52.939 --> 02:54.497
-Okay.
-Okay.

02:55.575 --> 02:57.008
Maybe I should just get married.

02:58.077 --> 03:00.204
Dating really is getting
embarrassing, isn't it?

03:00.380 --> 03:05.113
I know. Whenever I'm on a date,
I always feel like people can tell.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.617
People on dates shouldn't be
allowed out in public.

03:07.787 --> 03:09.846
It's embarrassing for them.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.650
It's painful for us to watch.

03:11.824 --> 03:14.622
I'm going out with someone later,
I'm not even taking her out.

03:14.794 --> 03:17.854
-Good for you.
-I don't need people staring at us.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.965
You're telling me.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.931
What was that?

03:27.874 --> 03:29.637
Gendason. What a jerk.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.937
I'm never playing golf
with him again.

03:33.112 --> 03:36.104
-Who? Gendason?
-Steve Gendason.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.874
Why does that name
sound so familiar?

03:38.051 --> 03:41.817
-He used to be a baseball player.
-How'd you end up golfing with him?

03:41.988 --> 03:43.853
I met him on the course
a couple years ago.

03:44.023 --> 03:47.322
Yeah. Played with him a lot.
But today was it.

03:47.493 --> 03:50.394
We're on the 15th hole.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.758
He's beating me by a couple
of strokes.

03:52.932 --> 03:55.423
Then he's about to hit
his second shot...

03:55.602 --> 04:01.063
...when he picks up the ball
and cleans it.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.903
-So what?
-Sorry.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.907
The rules clearly state you cannot
clean the ball unless it's on the green.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.813
-The rules are clear about that.
-Certainly are.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.921
-So I penalized him a stroke.
-So, what happened?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.023
He lost it!

04:18.524 --> 04:20.014
We almost came to blows.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.320
We're face to face,
like a manager and an umpire.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.986
We're like,
"Hey, what are you talking about?!

04:25.164 --> 04:30.227
-Think I'm gonna put up with that?!"
-All right. All right! You're in my face.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.095
I don't see what the big deal is.

04:32.272 --> 04:37.767
Hey, a rule is a rule. And let's face it,
without rules, there's chaos.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.411
I like Anna Quindlen's column.
And Safire.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.175
Don't you like Safire?

04:45.351 --> 04:47.285
Safire.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.444
Although at times
he can be rather pedantic.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.954
He can be pedantic.
He can be pedantic.

04:52.825 --> 04:54.952
And Bob Herbert's great.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.527
He worked for the <i>Daily News</i>.

04:56.696 --> 04:59.722
Yes. Yes.
You know what's interesting?

04:59.899 --> 05:03.266
The quarterback
for the Atlanta Falcons...

05:03.436 --> 05:07.133
...is Bobby Hebert, no R...

05:07.307 --> 05:08.672
...which I find fascinating.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.999
You know, it's Herbert...

05:11.177 --> 05:13.873
...H-E-R-B-E-R-T...

05:14.047 --> 05:18.416
...Hebert, H-E-B-E-R-T.

05:19.519 --> 05:23.148
Hebert. It's a fun name to pronounce.
Try and say it. Hebert.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.181
Go ahead, take a shot. Hebert.
All right.

05:26.359 --> 05:28.293
-Thanks. I got it.
-No. I'd like to pay.

05:28.461 --> 05:30.361
Now, Julie, Julie, don't insult me.

05:30.530 --> 05:33.021
What difference does it make
who pays? It's meaningless.

05:33.199 --> 05:36.168
-Okay, thanks, George.
-Here's your big salad to go.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.133
Oh, thank you.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.339
Hello.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.170
No, she's not here.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.505
Okay, fine. Whatever.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.444
Yes, I'll tell her.

05:50.616 --> 05:52.311
Okay, goodbye.

05:52.485 --> 05:57.388
Stationery-store guy called
to say he ordered your pencil.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.015
I told you. He has ideas.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.889
He doesn't even care
if a man answers.

06:03.062 --> 06:05.053
Or you.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.866
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.399
Hey.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.127
-Sorry we're late.
-It's no problem.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.795
-Here's your big salad.
-Thank you, Julie.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.531
You're very welcome.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.871
So I guess I better get going.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.377
Meeting Mother at the Guggenheim.
You don't wanna go?

06:21.547 --> 06:24.539
No, you Guggenheim.
I'm not much of a Guggenheimer.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.548
-You sure?
-Yeah, yeah. You go.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.779
-Okay, I'll see you later. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.860
Did you see
what just happened here?

06:38.564 --> 06:40.691
Well, that all depends.

06:41.134 --> 06:44.467
Did you happen to notice that Julie
handed the big salad to Elaine?

06:45.371 --> 06:48.033
-Yeah, so?
-Well, she didn't buy the big salad.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.869
I bought the big salad.

06:51.277 --> 06:52.835
-Is that a fact?
-Yes, it is.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.810
She just took credit for my salad.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.449
-That's not right.
-No, it isn't.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.278
-I'm the one who bought it.
-You did.

06:59.452 --> 07:01.511
-She should've said something.
-She could have.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.382
-Oh, I know.
-Imagine...

07:03.556 --> 07:07.356
...her taking credit
for your big salad.

07:08.127 --> 07:12.029
You buy a big salad for somebody,
it would be nice if they knew it.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.166
Obviously.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.162
-Turn on the TV.
-What?

07:16.335 --> 07:18.360
Put it on. Put it on!

07:18.971 --> 07:22.270
<i>Neither the district attorney's office
nor the police department...</i>

07:22.442 --> 07:24.433
<i>...have answered
any questions as yet.</i>

07:24.610 --> 07:26.544
<i>To repeat,
in case you're just joining us...</i>

07:26.712 --> 07:29.647
<i>...former baseball star
Steve Gendason has been taken...</i>

07:29.816 --> 07:31.807
<i>...to police headquarters
for questioning...</i>

07:31.984 --> 07:35.545
<i>...in the murder of Bobby Pinkus,
the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners...</i>

07:35.721 --> 07:39.054
<i>...at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue.</i>

07:39.225 --> 07:40.749
<i>According to Pinkus' wife...</i>

07:40.927 --> 07:43.828
<i>... Gendason had been involved
in a dispute with the cleaner...</i>

07:43.996 --> 07:47.397
<i>...over a stain on a pair
of gray Sansabelt slacks.</i>

07:47.934 --> 07:50.994
<i>We also have a report that
earlier in the day...</i>

07:51.170 --> 07:53.536
<i>...a groundskeeper at
Van Cortlandt golf course...</i>

07:53.706 --> 07:58.643
<i>...reportedly saw an irate Gendason
leaving the clubhouse in a huff.</i>

07:58.811 --> 08:01.507
<i>Whether there is a possible
connection between the two...</i>

08:01.681 --> 08:04.411
<i>...is something we'll just have
to wait and find out.</i>

08:05.585 --> 08:08.452
-Jerry.
-Well, it had nothing to do with you.

08:08.621 --> 08:11.089
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad
from the penalty stroke...

08:11.257 --> 08:12.849
...that he murdered the dry cleaner.

08:16.963 --> 08:19.693
Generally speaking,
you don't need any extra incentive...

08:19.866 --> 08:22.767
...to murder a dry cleaner.
I wouldn't worry about it.

08:25.972 --> 08:29.874
-I like Julie. She's very personable.
-Yeah, she's lovely.

08:30.576 --> 08:32.601
-That's great, George.
-Yeah.

08:40.953 --> 08:45.515
-So did you enjoy your lunch?
-Yeah. The big salad.

08:45.691 --> 08:49.024
It was very good.
Actually, it was too big.

08:51.197 --> 08:54.030
-Why?
-Oh, no reason.

08:55.801 --> 08:58.463
Because, you know,
she handed you the bag.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.361
I could have handed you the bag.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.737
But she happened to picked it up
at the restaurant, even though....

09:03.910 --> 09:05.810
Even though what?

09:07.113 --> 09:08.774
It's just....

09:08.948 --> 09:11.439
You thanked her, even though....

09:12.852 --> 09:14.615
What's the difference?

09:14.787 --> 09:17.051
What? What are you
trying to say, George?

09:17.223 --> 09:21.683
It's just that I was the one
that actually paid for the big salad.

09:21.861 --> 09:25.422
She just happened to hand it to you.
But it's no big deal.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.759
You want the money
for the big salad, George?

09:27.934 --> 09:29.799
-No, no.
-Then what is your problem?

09:29.969 --> 09:31.960
There is no problem.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.208
Just a small miscommunication
whereby you thanked her...

09:36.375 --> 09:38.605
...instead of the person
actually responsible...

09:38.778 --> 09:41.576
...for the purchasing
of the big salad.

09:43.049 --> 09:47.315
Kramer played golf with him,
and Kramer thinks a penalty stroke...

09:47.486 --> 09:49.852
...may have driven him to it.

09:50.656 --> 09:53.124
Well, they haven't even
arrested him yet.

09:53.292 --> 09:55.522
Come on. Let's go out.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.890
No, I don't think so.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.788
Why not?

09:59.966 --> 10:02.457
We don't need a bunch of people
staring at us.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.998
-Who's staring?
-Oh, they're staring.

10:05.171 --> 10:07.196
They know we're on a date.
They're making fun.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.102
Come on. It's embarrassing.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.937
Hello?

10:13.312 --> 10:15.940
No, she's not here.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.106
Yes, I will tell her.

10:18.618 --> 10:22.918
No, I don't know what time
she might be coming back.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.681
Look, I gotta go.

10:25.324 --> 10:27.258
Bye.

10:27.426 --> 10:30.088
That's.... It's a long story.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.498
Hello, Newman.

10:35.234 --> 10:37.168
Hello, Jerry.
I was wondering if you knew...

10:37.336 --> 10:39.395
-...where Kramer was.
-No, I don't. Why?

10:39.572 --> 10:42.473
You know, Gendason.
This is something, isn't it?

10:42.708 --> 10:45.336
-I suppose.
-What did Kramer say?

10:45.511 --> 10:48.105
-I don't know. Nothing.
-Come on, Jerry.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.044
You know something.
Tell me! Tell me!

10:51.784 --> 10:53.615
Oh, Chunkys.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.185
Margaret?

11:02.128 --> 11:05.529
-Hello.
-You two know each other?

11:05.831 --> 11:07.856
You might say that.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.999
We used to go out.

11:13.606 --> 11:17.098
Well, toodle-loo.

11:17.276 --> 11:20.143
Nice seeing you again, Margaret.
Bye, Jerry.

11:20.312 --> 11:22.212
Have fun.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.450
You went out with Newman?

11:34.360 --> 11:37.591
-Just a few times.
-Why?

11:39.098 --> 11:43.398
-I liked him.
-You liked Newman?

11:43.969 --> 11:46.699
Look, I'm a little uncomfortable
talking about this, okay?

11:46.872 --> 11:51.309
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious.
Why did you stop seeing him?

11:51.944 --> 11:53.775
He ended it.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.979
He ended it?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.913
Yes. Yes.

12:01.087 --> 12:04.250
It was a couple of years ago.
Why, does it matter?

12:04.423 --> 12:07.392
No. No, of course not.

12:08.427 --> 12:11.328
Jerry, they found a tee.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.896
-What tee?
-A golf tee in the dry cleaner.

12:22.875 --> 12:26.276
Newman.
She went out with Newman.

12:26.512 --> 12:29.072
-It must be a mistake.
-No. It isn't.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.240
And the most distressing part
is not that she went out with him...

12:32.418 --> 12:34.784
...but that he stopped seeing her.

12:35.654 --> 12:38.487
Do you understand?
He, Newman...

12:38.657 --> 12:41.182
...Newman stopped seeing her.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.952
Newman never stops
seeing anybody.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.757
Newman will see
whoever is willing to see him.

12:45.931 --> 12:49.332
So the question, then, is not
so much why did she see him...

12:49.969 --> 12:52.563
...as disturbing as that is...

12:52.738 --> 12:56.936
...but why did he, Newman,
stop seeing her?

12:58.210 --> 13:01.976
Perhaps there's more to Newman
than meets the eye.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.748
No. There's less.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.016
-It's possible.
-No, it isn't.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.123
I've looked into his eyes.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.282
He's pure evil.

13:15.261 --> 13:18.355
Maybe he's an enigma.
A mystery wrapped in a riddle.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.829
Yeah. He's a mystery
wrapped in a Twinkie.

13:21.667 --> 13:24.932
-Can I get you some more coffee?
-No, but thank you.

13:25.104 --> 13:28.130
By the way, your stationery-store guy
called. He's got your pencil.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.100
You are kidding me.

13:31.277 --> 13:35.008
No. He left the store early, made a
special trip to the distributor and got it.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.479
I bought one yesterday
on 14th Street.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.141
What did you do that for?
He already ordered it.

13:40.319 --> 13:43.447
-I wanted to please Mr. Pitt.
-You better go down and tell this guy.

13:43.622 --> 13:46.750
-He's very excited.
-Oh, boy.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.550
-Oh, hi, Julie.
-Hi.

13:48.727 --> 13:50.558
-Hi, Julie.
-How are you, Elaine?

13:50.729 --> 13:53.994
-I'm meeting George here.
-Well, then I better get going.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.191
Otherwise George will make me
buy him lunch...

13:56.368 --> 13:58.893
...to make up for that big salad
he bought me yesterday.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.670
How do you know that?

14:04.410 --> 14:07.573
-Who is it?
-It's Jerry.

14:07.746 --> 14:10.180
It's kind of a bad time.
Could you come back later?

14:10.349 --> 14:11.839
Come on, Newman, open the door!

14:17.356 --> 14:19.324
Hello, Jerry.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.120
What a rare treat. What brings you
down to the east wing?

14:24.296 --> 14:27.424
Okay, pudgy, let's stop playing games.
What happened with Margaret?

14:27.600 --> 14:30.091
Don't get excited.
Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?

14:30.269 --> 14:35.036
No, we can't. My skin is crawling
just being inside your little rat's nest.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.300
-Now, what happened?
-You wanna know what happened?

14:39.478 --> 14:41.708
I'll tell you what happened.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.145
She wasn't my type.

14:44.516 --> 14:47.417
-Not your type?
-Not really.

14:47.586 --> 14:51.613
-Well, how come?
-She just didn't do it for me.

14:51.790 --> 14:56.227
-What is wrong with her?
-Well, if you're happy with her...

14:56.395 --> 14:58.488
...that's all that matters.

14:59.698 --> 15:02.792
-You don't think she's attractive?
-No.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.695
I need a really pretty face.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.897
But, hey, that's me.

15:09.775 --> 15:12.005
Okay, Newman. Thanks a lot.

15:12.177 --> 15:14.338
-Care for some lemonade?
-No, thank you.

15:14.513 --> 15:17.414
Drop by anytime, Jerry.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.983
Jerry. All right, now, listen to this.

15:24.690 --> 15:28.023
"lf a player cleans his ball
during play of a hole...

15:28.193 --> 15:32.789
...except on the putting green,
he shall incur a penalty of one stroke."

15:32.965 --> 15:34.956
-That's the rule.
-It's just a friendly game.

15:35.134 --> 15:39.070
-Why are you always such a stickler?
-That's the way I was raised.

15:39.238 --> 15:42.503
When I was growing up,
I had to be in bed every night by 9:00.

15:42.675 --> 15:47.078
And if I wasn't.... Well, I don't have
to tell you what happened.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.942
What are you so worried
about this for?

15:51.116 --> 15:53.346
You know he talked about Pinkus
on the course?

15:53.519 --> 15:54.747
-He did?
-Oh, yeah.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.151
He said he brought his pants to
Pinkus', and they came back stained...

15:58.324 --> 16:00.690
...with some kind
of dry-cleaning fluid.

16:00.859 --> 16:02.986
And Pinkus denied responsibility.

16:03.162 --> 16:04.925
You see?
He was very upset at Pinkus.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.962
So it had nothing to do with you.

16:07.199 --> 16:09.531
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him
over the edge.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.899
-No, I don't think so.
-Poor Pinkus.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.698
Poor little Pinkus.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.704
Hey, let me ask you a question.

16:19.878 --> 16:22.472
You met Margaret.
You think Margaret's good-looking?

16:22.881 --> 16:25.850
She's a natural beauty.
No makeup? I like that.

16:26.018 --> 16:28.714
Yeah. And the curls?
You like the curls?

16:28.887 --> 16:32.448
-Oh, I love curls.
-Yeah. Yeah, me too.

16:32.624 --> 16:34.353
-I'll see you later.
-Where you going?

16:34.526 --> 16:36.585
-Gendason's.
-You're going to see Gendason?

16:36.762 --> 16:38.889
It's weighing on my conscience.

16:41.867 --> 16:45.667
I think I could have played with dolls
if there were dolls in the house.

16:46.105 --> 16:47.697
It seems like fun to me.

16:47.873 --> 16:52.401
It doesn't seem like a gender thing.
I think I would like to play with dolls.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.508
What's so terrible?

16:55.114 --> 16:57.674
So, George, I was talking
to Elaine before--

16:57.850 --> 16:59.715
We're just friends.

17:00.719 --> 17:04.382
Yes, well, anyway, she said something
that was kind of intriguing.

17:04.556 --> 17:05.853
Share.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.586
Well, when I came over to the table,
she mentioned something...

17:09.762 --> 17:13.323
...about how she'd better hurry up and
leave or you'd make her buy lunch...

17:13.499 --> 17:15.592
...to make up for the one
you bought yesterday.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.335
I'm not following.

17:20.506 --> 17:24.135
Well, my question is, how could Elaine
be under the impression...

17:24.309 --> 17:26.435
...that you bought the big salad...

17:26.612 --> 17:28.637
...when I was the one
that handed it to her?

17:30.149 --> 17:32.208
Well, she probably just assumed.

17:33.318 --> 17:35.115
Did she?

17:38.023 --> 17:39.684
Wait a second.

17:40.292 --> 17:44.558
Are you suggesting that I went
out of my way to tell Elaine...

17:44.730 --> 17:48.791
...that even though you handed her
the big salad, that it came from me?

17:48.967 --> 17:50.958
That's what I'm suggesting.

17:52.304 --> 17:54.704
Well, it was a big salad.

17:55.674 --> 17:58.666
And what I would like to know
is how does a person...

17:58.844 --> 18:01.642
...who has virtually nothing
to do with the big salad...

18:01.814 --> 18:04.044
...claim responsibility
for that salad...

18:04.216 --> 18:08.414
...and accept a thank-you
under false pretenses?

18:10.889 --> 18:13.915
George, all I did was
hand someone a bag.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.398
It's just that my boss
is very demanding...

18:22.568 --> 18:24.627
...and he needed the pencil
right away.

18:24.803 --> 18:27.465
Well, why did you tell me
to order it if you knew...

18:27.639 --> 18:30.107
...you were going to get one
someplace else?

18:30.275 --> 18:32.835
No, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

18:33.011 --> 18:35.343
I went all the way down
to the warehouse.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.744
It took me three hours.

18:37.916 --> 18:40.146
I had a big fight with the foreman.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.977
Really? A fight with the foreman?

18:43.155 --> 18:49.287
-Yes.
-Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.951
Yeah?

18:52.498 --> 18:54.966
Well, then how about
going out with me?

18:55.767 --> 18:57.496
Okay.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.504
I mean, they found a tee.
And he played golf that day.

19:05.677 --> 19:08.237
Nobody walks into a dry cleaners'
with a tee.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.410
The circumstantial evidence
is overwhelming.

19:12.084 --> 19:15.076
You had how many dates with him?
Three?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.146
Around three. I don't know.

19:19.858 --> 19:21.086
And...?

19:22.261 --> 19:24.752
I told you, he stopped calling me.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.763
I moved on. I'm not hung up on him.

19:31.103 --> 19:35.062
-What are you looking at?
-What? I'm not looking. Nothing.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.236
Why are you looking at my face?

19:38.577 --> 19:40.169
Where am I gonna look?

19:41.780 --> 19:43.247
Kiss me.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:52.357 --> 19:54.086
I can't.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.157
Newman.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.262
Newman ruined it.
All I could think of...

20:06.438 --> 20:11.205
...when I was looking at her face was,
"Newman found this unacceptable."

20:11.610 --> 20:14.875
I'm going out
with the stationery-store guy.

20:15.614 --> 20:18.310
You're going out
with the stationery-store guy?

20:18.483 --> 20:22.613
I felt so guilty about the pencil
I couldn't say no.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.026
Well, well, well.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.163
I'm not treating you
to lunch anymore!

20:33.999 --> 20:37.264
You had to tell Julie that I made
a special point of telling you...

20:37.436 --> 20:39.961
...that I bought you
the big salad, didn't you?

20:41.974 --> 20:45.410
You know, if it was a regular salad,
I wouldn't have said anything.

20:45.577 --> 20:49.172
But you had to have the big salad!

20:53.986 --> 20:55.681
Hello?

20:55.854 --> 20:57.321
What?

20:57.489 --> 20:58.922
You're kidding.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.718
I'm turning it on.

21:00.892 --> 21:03.622
Oh, my God, get out of here.

21:04.196 --> 21:07.097
Hey, listen to this. They issued
a warrant for Gendason's arrest.

21:07.266 --> 21:11.032
He escaped, and the police spotted
him on the New Jersey Turnpike.

21:11.203 --> 21:15.230
<i>As you can see,
he's in a white Ford Bronco.</i>

21:15.407 --> 21:17.841
<i>The police have cleared
the highway traffic in front...</i>

21:18.010 --> 21:19.705
<i>...but they are keeping
their distance.</i>

21:19.878 --> 21:22.210
<i>They don't want this situation
to escalate.</i>

21:22.381 --> 21:26.613
<i>And we have gotten an identification
on the driver of the vehicle.</i>

21:26.785 --> 21:28.514
His name is Kramer...

21:28.687 --> 21:32.214
...and he's reportedly one
of Gendason's golfing buddies.

21:34.393 --> 21:36.190
<i>911, what are you reporting?</i>

21:36.361 --> 21:38.989
Yeah, this is Kramer.
I got Gendason in the car.

21:39.164 --> 21:40.825
Now, he wants to see his fish.

21:40.999 --> 21:44.730
I'm taking him to see his fish,
so tell the police to back off.

21:44.903 --> 21:47.030
<i>Okay, sir. And what's your name?</i>

21:47.205 --> 21:50.606
My name is Kramer.
You know who I am, damn it!

21:51.810 --> 21:54.904
-I told you not to take the turnpike.
-I thought we would blend in.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.207
If you took the Palisades,
this wouldn't happen.

21:57.382 --> 22:01.045
-Then we would've had bridge traffic.
-Just drive.

22:08.627 --> 22:12.529
To me, murder doesn't even really
seem like that great of a revenge.

22:12.698 --> 22:17.226
Wouldn't years of subtle psychological
mind games be a lot more satisfying?

22:17.402 --> 22:20.633
Constantly calling them and hanging
up when they pick up the phone.

22:20.806 --> 22:24.173
Sending pizzas and taxis
to their house all night long.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.938
After a while they go, "l wish this guy
would kill me. I can't take it anymore!"

22:30.148 --> 22:32.776
How come when the police
catch some really bad criminal...

22:32.951 --> 22:35.681
...they put him in the handcuffs,
hit him with the baton...

22:35.854 --> 22:39.290
...put the chokehold on him, but then
they don't want him to hurt his head...

22:39.458 --> 22:41.824
...when they're putting him
in the patrol car.

22:41.993 --> 22:46.487
"Watch your head. Don't hit that
metal edge there. That really hurts."
