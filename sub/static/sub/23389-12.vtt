"The Path"...

00:02.819 --> 00:04.951
This is my resort property

00:05.031 --> 00:06.085
on Kuta Beach.

00:06.162 --> 00:07.673
I would like to convert it

00:07.742 --> 00:10.148
into the first Meyerist Center
in Asia.

00:10.273 --> 00:11.839
To the Light in Bali.

00:11.924 --> 00:14.059
He wants me to take things
over for a couple of days.

00:14.091 --> 00:16.388
Okay, but you're still gonna
make it to Washington, right?

00:16.456 --> 00:17.932
No, actually no. No, I can't.

00:18.009 --> 00:19.351
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

00:19.428 --> 00:21.021
A waitress from
a women's rights dinner.

00:21.090 --> 00:22.830
- What are you doing here?
- So nice to meet you.

00:22.899 --> 00:24.668
Thanks for supporting
a woman's right to choose.

00:24.737 --> 00:26.088
Let's get the vote out
in November.

00:26.157 --> 00:27.581
Something happened, Cal.

00:27.658 --> 00:29.501
- Happened?
- To you.

00:29.578 --> 00:31.346
With Steve.

00:31.423 --> 00:33.975
- How did...
- You don't have to tell me.

00:34.052 --> 00:36.139
We are looking at
the very first draft of Ladder,

00:36.216 --> 00:37.400
and I believe that

00:37.477 --> 00:39.103
there's a second author.
Lilith.

00:39.180 --> 00:40.948
She believes that Eddie
will die.

00:41.025 --> 00:42.903
- Why?
- The Movement will crumble

00:42.980 --> 00:45.457
without Eddie, and the world
will crumble

00:45.534 --> 00:47.203
without The Movement.
Where is she?

00:47.280 --> 00:49.131
I just knew you'd
find me.

00:49.208 --> 00:51.754
You never told me that Vera
was your daughter.

00:51.831 --> 00:53.222
Vera put me in here,

00:53.299 --> 00:55.310
and she's the only one
who can get me out.

00:55.387 --> 00:57.181
I think you're right
where you need to be.

Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"A New American Religion"</font>

01:41.980 --> 01:43.691
The Meyerist Movement,
until recently,

01:43.768 --> 01:46.537
was a small fringe
movement in upstate New York.

01:46.614 --> 01:48.993
In the past year, they've
increased their membership

01:49.070 --> 01:51.129
70% and expanded to Europe.

01:51.206 --> 01:54.135
You called it a
"Second‐generation phenomenon."

01:54.212 --> 01:57.051
Uh, yeah, their... their
founder, Dr. Steven Meyer,

01:57.128 --> 01:59.480
recently died.
Now...

01:59.557 --> 02:01.059
It's very rare
for a new religion

02:01.136 --> 02:02.729
not to die with its founder.

02:02.806 --> 02:05.233
In this case, their new leader,
Eddie Lane,

02:05.310 --> 02:08.205
tripled the base.

02:08.282 --> 02:11.921
Now, he's a guy from a
blue collar family in Brooklyn,

02:11.998 --> 02:14.836
with a history
of mental illness and abuse.

02:14.913 --> 02:20.222
He married a woman high up
in the faith in 1999.

02:20.299 --> 02:24.322
Took over October
of last year.

02:24.399 --> 02:28.037
And, uh, has
a mystical experience

02:28.114 --> 02:31.202
in the first few weeks
of his leadership.

02:31.279 --> 02:33.874
He walks a pregnant woman

02:33.951 --> 02:35.552
through fire

02:35.629 --> 02:38.350
a video which conveniently
trends on YouTube.

02:38.427 --> 02:40.888
I've seen the video.
Are you saying it was staged?

02:40.965 --> 02:42.358
I'm not
saying anything

02:42.435 --> 02:44.574
I don't have the facts
to back up.

02:45.649 --> 02:46.817
You called your article

02:46.894 --> 02:49.287
"The Fastest Growing Faith."

02:49.364 --> 02:51.249
What do you think it is
about Meyerism

02:51.326 --> 02:53.288
that appeals to this
younger generation?

02:53.365 --> 02:55.752
The future is
more uncertain than ever.

02:55.829 --> 02:59.850
And young people are looking
for something to believe in,

02:59.927 --> 03:02.139
and Lane has
an "everyman" quality.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.775
He's a regular guy.

03:03.852 --> 03:05.897
That is until he asked you
to sign your life away.

03:05.974 --> 03:08.652
He recently introduced
a 25‐page contract

03:08.729 --> 03:11.617
for all members
for their "security,"

03:11.694 --> 03:15.089
um, that essentially
requires them

03:15.166 --> 03:17.720
to waive basic human rights.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.841
Have you ever seen
this guy before?

03:19.918 --> 03:21.310
No.

03:21.387 --> 03:24.141
Somebody's talked to him,
obviously.

03:24.218 --> 03:27.823
We'll check the log of
Possibles and intake sessions.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.404
We can look at security footage
outside the city center.

03:30.481 --> 03:32.241
I'm sure that's where
he came in.

03:32.318 --> 03:35.087
Yes, I was able to
get my hands

03:35.164 --> 03:37.008
on early notebooks of Meyer's,

03:37.085 --> 03:39.381
notebooks that no one
had seen before

03:39.458 --> 03:41.593
or rather they'd
been hidden away.

03:41.670 --> 03:44.933
And these notebooks pointed
to another writer.

03:45.010 --> 03:47.111
A darker voice.

03:47.188 --> 03:50.327
And my research showed her
to have been a patient

03:50.404 --> 03:51.747
of Steven Meyer's...
What notebook?

03:51.815 --> 03:53.199
When she was she
was just 13.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.328
Are they real?
Is he making this up?

03:55.405 --> 03:57.048
Meyerism is not
a religion.

03:57.125 --> 03:59.086
It is not a "movement"
as they like to call it.

03:59.163 --> 04:01.516
Lane is a dangerous man.

04:01.593 --> 04:03.219
And this is a cult.

04:03.296 --> 04:07.102
♪♪

04:12.489 --> 04:14.708
It's disgusting,
and it's libel.

It's a direct attack on Steve.
Yes, it is.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.293
And what the hell was
that bullshit

04:19.370 --> 04:21.178
about someone else
writing The Ladder?

04:21.255 --> 04:23.141
How did he even find out
about the contract?

04:23.218 --> 04:25.221
- We're looking into it.
- What about the article?

04:25.298 --> 04:27.100
Can you get a retraction?

04:27.177 --> 04:29.063
Um...

04:29.140 --> 04:30.532
No.

04:30.609 --> 04:34.038
No.
But there is some good news.

04:34.115 --> 04:36.411
I've been in touch
with Ruben's producers,

04:36.488 --> 04:38.882
and they got a great response
to the segment

04:38.959 --> 04:40.335
and would like to bring Eddie

04:40.412 --> 04:42.013
on for a follow‐up
next Thursday.

04:42.090 --> 04:44.386
You'll be able to go head
to head with Professor Neill.

04:45.806 --> 04:48.101
Eddie, we have plenty
of time to prep,

04:48.178 --> 04:50.355
and they've promised us
an unbiased forum

04:50.432 --> 04:53.487
for our response.
It will not be unbiased.

04:53.564 --> 04:55.323
Okay? He called us a cult.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.954
Yeah, and you can explain
why we're not.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.584
Eddie, it's a... it's a very good
show.

05:00.661 --> 05:03.172
It's popular,
and Ruben will moderate.

05:03.605 --> 05:04.892
I...

05:05.136 --> 05:07.229
I think it's a good move.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.487
Eddie. You have to do this.

05:12.656 --> 05:14.159
I agree.

05:15.824 --> 05:17.744
You have to go on that show.

05:17.821 --> 05:19.589
Defend us.

05:20.167 --> 05:21.461
And Steve.

05:28.307 --> 05:29.851
I can't do this.

05:29.995 --> 05:31.237
Cal.

05:31.980 --> 05:33.511
I mean, I...

05:33.777 --> 05:36.908
Can go on and defend myself,
but how can I defend him?

05:39.261 --> 05:41.053
Um...

05:43.671 --> 05:45.706
I'll do it.

05:46.469 --> 05:48.305
He's taken enough from me.

05:48.503 --> 05:49.993
It's time.

05:53.015 --> 05:54.434
Are you sure?

05:58.552 --> 06:00.640
I'd really like to do this.

06:13.517 --> 06:15.876
Mary?
Buck needs to see you.

06:18.157 --> 06:19.576
I didn't read
that article,

06:19.653 --> 06:21.796
the exposé
in "The New Yorker."

06:21.866 --> 06:24.377
I mean, you spend your time
reading magazines,

06:24.461 --> 06:26.273
you don't get shit else done
in your day.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.244
But one of my interns,
they have Google alerts

06:28.313 --> 06:29.804
for everything.
It's not true.

06:29.881 --> 06:31.064
I did skim it.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.776
Some other woman involved?

06:32.853 --> 06:35.329
Always a woman
behind the man, huh?

06:37.028 --> 06:39.115
So, that's it?

06:43.917 --> 06:46.170
I called your husband
because I have a problem.

06:46.247 --> 06:48.430
An impulse
that I can't control.

06:48.622 --> 06:52.177
An impulse that I know
could destroy me.

06:52.426 --> 06:55.118
And you are actually
helping me.

06:55.474 --> 06:57.790
Meyerism is effective.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.915
You're effective.

07:00.345 --> 07:03.001
You're a force, you know that?

07:05.125 --> 07:08.680
What if you came to work
for me?

07:09.157 --> 07:10.938
Be on my staff.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.684
- As what?
- Executive Assistant

07:13.761 --> 07:15.486
but you'd function
as an advisor.

07:15.563 --> 07:17.199
I want you on the team
when I run for governor.

07:17.267 --> 07:20.538
You'd get hands‐on
campaign experience, and...

07:20.615 --> 07:23.369
Then when we move to Albany,
you can transition to be

07:23.446 --> 07:25.749
in my office there,
if you wanted.

07:25.826 --> 07:28.360
I'll admit it's enticing.

07:29.766 --> 07:31.437
Health insurance for you
and your family,

07:31.505 --> 07:34.182
travel stipend,
full‐time salary.

07:34.259 --> 07:35.693
I mean...

07:35.770 --> 07:38.357
It's government so you're
not gonna be rich,

07:38.434 --> 07:41.824
but it'd be something like...

07:44.120 --> 07:46.583
- What about Cal?
- What about him?

07:46.660 --> 07:50.274
He's the... the one
with the insight.

07:50.876 --> 07:52.712
I don't know.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.439
He didn't charm the pants off

07:54.508 --> 07:56.133
the ladies
for reproductive rights,

07:56.211 --> 07:57.654
and he didn't keep me

07:57.731 --> 07:59.316
from getting a hollow blow job

07:59.393 --> 08:01.529
from that waitress afterward.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.063
You did.

08:03.366 --> 08:05.286
And the fact
that I'm a Meyerist?

08:05.363 --> 08:06.509
Oh.

08:06.707 --> 08:07.917
I believe in the separation

08:07.994 --> 08:09.886
of Church and State.

08:09.963 --> 08:12.760
Of course, if it came out
on the campaign trail,

08:12.837 --> 08:14.855
that would be annoying, but

08:14.932 --> 08:16.811
personally it doesn't
bother me.

08:20.777 --> 08:22.405
What the fuck, Sarah?

08:24.075 --> 08:26.712
I know.
I'm furious.

08:26.789 --> 08:29.384
How could you trust
someone like that?

08:29.461 --> 08:31.130
I met him
at a vulnerable time.

08:31.207 --> 08:32.765
I'm going to talk to him.

08:32.842 --> 08:34.470
You're done with him, okay?

08:34.547 --> 08:36.523
I need you now.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.462
Everything that he knows
I need to know and more.

08:39.541 --> 08:40.993
Okay?

08:41.861 --> 08:43.429
Let's go.

09:00.272 --> 09:02.634
So you were one
of Steve's patients.

09:02.812 --> 09:04.259
Yes.

09:04.990 --> 09:08.360
And The Ladder.
You saw in your dreams?

09:08.798 --> 09:09.931
Visions, yes.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.295
So what happened
on Huayna Picchu?

09:12.563 --> 09:15.134
I don't know. I wasn't there.

09:15.211 --> 09:18.845
But Steve had
a wonderful imagination.

09:19.165 --> 09:20.646
All right, so what's
the difference

09:20.723 --> 09:24.290
between Steve's imagination
and your dreams?

09:24.805 --> 09:26.590
My dreams come true.

09:26.946 --> 09:29.956
So Eddie has to die
for your apocalypse to happen?

09:30.243 --> 09:32.259
Eddie doesn't have
to die.

09:32.434 --> 09:34.548
Eddie gets to die.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.513
What if you're just
a mentally ill person.

09:37.590 --> 09:39.165
I'm not.

09:43.265 --> 09:45.777
Why not ask the professor
about all of this?

09:45.846 --> 09:47.222
He seems to know more
than anyone.

09:47.291 --> 09:48.726
How do you know about that?

09:48.795 --> 09:50.407
We get "The New Yorker"
in the loony bin, dear.

09:50.476 --> 09:52.842
We're not savages.

09:53.224 --> 09:55.466
It was you, wasn't it, Sarah?

09:57.271 --> 09:58.395
I thought so.

09:58.472 --> 10:01.069
All that information about me
had to come from you.

10:01.138 --> 10:02.737
Well...

10:02.814 --> 10:05.652
I wish I could
change the future.

10:05.729 --> 10:08.403
But I can't. None of us can.

10:08.868 --> 10:12.966
You understand, Eddie.
You've had visions too.

10:22.091 --> 10:25.325
All right,
well, thank you, Lilith.

10:27.196 --> 10:31.545
Vera, I want you
to get her out of here.

10:32.091 --> 10:34.350
That's... that's
not a good idea.

10:34.419 --> 10:36.249
I don't care.

10:36.318 --> 10:37.883
No, she's right.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.872
Lilith has manipulated
and lied.

10:40.997 --> 10:43.974
Eddie. You don't know her.

10:44.474 --> 10:46.154
If she's out in the world,
she'll make sure

10:46.226 --> 10:47.736
that prophecy
comes true.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.575
Well, I don't want to lock up
someone for

10:50.652 --> 10:52.587
her ideas.

10:52.797 --> 10:55.510
That's exactly what Steve
did to her.

10:58.007 --> 10:59.713
Get her out.

11:00.179 --> 11:03.986
♪♪

11:23.879 --> 11:25.842
I had to do it.

11:32.535 --> 11:35.791
I think maybe my father

11:36.127 --> 11:38.135
wasn't my father.

11:38.506 --> 11:40.891
What are you talking about?

11:40.968 --> 11:43.605
There was this man

11:43.682 --> 11:45.477
He went to college
with my parents.

11:45.554 --> 11:47.686
He was my dad's best friend.

11:48.397 --> 11:51.697
When I was a child, he would,
you know, visit in the summers,

11:51.774 --> 11:54.829
holidays, that kind of thing.
Always brought me something.

11:54.906 --> 11:58.677
One night I woke up
to get some water.

11:58.754 --> 12:02.260
My mother and Rajeev were
arguing in the kitchen,

12:02.337 --> 12:07.277

12:07.354 --> 12:11.202
in my mother's eyes,
and I just knew...

12:11.279 --> 12:13.449
They must have been lovers.

12:13.526 --> 12:15.917
It made sense to me.

12:15.986 --> 12:19.628
My whole childhood
I never felt like my parents.

12:19.705 --> 12:23.352
They were scientists.
I liked stories.

12:23.429 --> 12:26.852
I always felt like I had been
born into the wrong family.

12:29.733 --> 12:32.202
What happened to him?

12:32.279 --> 12:35.494
He died of a brain tumor
before he was 30.

12:39.084 --> 12:41.422
Why are you telling me
all of this now?

12:41.499 --> 12:44.158
There are things I haven't
told you.

12:44.797 --> 12:48.010
Things I need you to know.

12:48.353 --> 12:49.933

12:57.037 --> 12:58.755
Why now?

12:58.832 --> 13:01.697

The end.

13:01.917 --> 13:04.408
It's gonna be in Bali.

13:06.097 --> 13:09.697
Wait. Who... who told you
about Bali?

13:10.619 --> 13:13.284

13:13.361 --> 13:16.534
That we're going there
to set up a new site.

13:16.611 --> 13:19.212

Yeah, but why would someone
want to do that?

14:59.315 --> 15:03.170
about your history
with The Movement.

15:03.247 --> 15:05.501
Well, Mr. Wise,
I came to Meyerism

15:05.578 --> 15:07.046
when I was a young child.

15:07.123 --> 15:09.140
My parents were, ah,

15:09.217 --> 15:11.688
unfit to care for me.
You said "ah."

15:11.765 --> 15:13.517
And you should call him Ruben.

15:13.594 --> 15:16.148
All the other guests do,
I checked.

15:18.194 --> 15:20.414
All right. Well, Ruben,

15:20.491 --> 15:22.585
I came to Meyerism
when I was a young child.

15:22.662 --> 15:24.456
My parents were unfit
to care for me,

15:24.533 --> 15:27.671
and the community embraced me
in their absence.

15:27.748 --> 15:32.855
The compound became my home
and still is to this day.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.520
Professor Neill describes
Dr. Steven Meyer as

15:35.597 --> 15:38.651
"a master manipulator, who
stole the tenet of the religion

15:38.728 --> 15:41.907
from a very ill,
young female patient."

15:42.785 --> 15:44.774
Dr. Meyer did no such thing.

15:44.948 --> 15:48.096
His aim was to help people

15:48.165 --> 15:48.885
- and, uh,
- Sorry, I...

15:48.954 --> 15:50.466
I can't let you do this.
Hang on.

15:50.535 --> 15:53.423
Hang... let me figure out
the right way to say it.

15:57.918 --> 15:59.407
Hm.

16:00.069 --> 16:02.063
You're defending him.

16:02.692 --> 16:04.087
Hmm?

16:04.657 --> 16:06.688
I don't know the details.

16:07.494 --> 16:08.876
But I know.

16:09.092 --> 16:11.472
I know Steve abused you.

16:21.613 --> 16:22.997
Yeah.

16:23.074 --> 16:26.337
Then why... how can you do
this?

16:26.414 --> 16:28.132
Because I want to own
the narrative.

16:28.209 --> 16:29.503
Going on a TV show and saying

16:29.580 --> 16:30.971
that Steve was a brilliant man

16:31.048 --> 16:32.884
isn't owning anything.
No, you're wrong.

16:32.961 --> 16:35.389
Because he's dead and now I get
to speak for his Movement

16:35.466 --> 16:36.709
and have his followers.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.045
He couldn't destroy me,

16:38.114 --> 16:39.475
and now I'm the one
with the power.

16:39.544 --> 16:41.693

That's okay, Ruben, I'm not

Yes, going all the way back
to your founder.

35:58.749 --> 36:00.308
Something called The HC?

36:00.385 --> 36:02.345
As a type
of autoerotic asphyxiation

dark urges...

36:07.064 --> 36:10.202

36:15.498 --> 36:18.335
Dr. Steven Meyer founded
The Movement

36:18.412 --> 36:22.017

in the world

a community

Yes, they do,

but they don't blindly follow
some guy from Brooklyn

37:15.818 --> 37:17.287

Jesus wasn't

37:17.364 --> 37:18.881
from Brooklyn.
That is true.

37:18.958 --> 37:21.052
Is it Brooklyn specifically
that's the problem?

Well, I choose to believe

37:33.104 --> 37:34.746
in a Garden.

37:34.823 --> 37:38.629
That's what helps me get
through my day.

37:38.706 --> 37:39.925
That and the belief
that I'm helping

37:39.993 --> 37:41.586
others do the same thing.

37:41.663 --> 37:45.434
So if having deep faith

37:45.511 --> 37:47.605
in something greater than you

37:47.682 --> 37:50.269
makes you a cult
then I guess we're a cult.

37:50.346 --> 37:52.608
- Yes. Yes.
- We'll be back.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.417
Hey.

37:57.494 --> 37:58.745
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:58.822 --> 38:00.088
Everything okay?

38:00.165 --> 38:02.126
Yeah, yeah, just felt
like being home.

38:02.203 --> 38:05.308
Since when do we have a TV?
It's just to see Cal.

38:05.385 --> 38:08.138
- Here, sit down.
- Are you staying the night?

38:08.215 --> 38:11.980
- Um, yeah, maybe.
- Grandma lives in your room.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.276
I will sleep on the couch.

38:16.532 --> 38:19.753
Welcome back.
Cal, before the break,

38:19.830 --> 38:21.381
you called Meyerism

38:21.458 --> 38:22.960
a beacon of hope and light

38:23.037 --> 38:26.015
in today's confusing
and dangerous world.

38:26.092 --> 38:27.727
Can you talk a little more

38:27.804 --> 38:31.018
about why Meyerism is more
relevant now than ever?

38:31.095 --> 38:33.572
Yeah, sure, sure, Ruben.

38:33.649 --> 38:35.534
Everybody's searching.

38:35.611 --> 38:38.950
It's not a comfortable notion,
but I... I think we're all

38:39.027 --> 38:41.421
in some sort of cult.

38:41.498 --> 38:44.678
A job. Alcoholics Anonymous.
SoulCycle.

38:44.755 --> 38:47.008
A class...
So now I'm a cult leader.

38:47.085 --> 38:49.805
Yes, okay, of course.
Education is about searching.

38:49.882 --> 38:53.737
But I assure you, we do not
enlist students in some sort

38:53.814 --> 38:55.910
of, for people to sign away...
I read some of your reviews

38:55.978 --> 38:59.199
when I was prepping for...
for this interview.

38:59.276 --> 39:01.753
Um, uh, bear with me.

39:01.830 --> 39:03.256
You're quite popular.
Thank you.

39:03.333 --> 39:04.636
All your classes
have waiting lists.

39:04.704 --> 39:06.338
- Okay, that's great.
- Um...

39:06.415 --> 39:09.052
Right. Oh,
"Professor Neill is brilliant,

39:09.129 --> 39:11.390
brilliant, and he knows it."

39:11.467 --> 39:14.571
"So smart, so hot."

39:14.648 --> 39:16.316
"His class will change
your life."

39:16.393 --> 39:18.003
Oh, yeah, here's one.

39:18.072 --> 39:20.019
Um
"Professor Neill has

39:20.088 --> 39:21.550
- a 'cult following' on campus."
- Wait, seriously, you keep

39:21.619 --> 39:23.019
trying to make this point.
This is ridiculous.

39:23.088 --> 39:24.966
We do not ask students to sign

39:25.043 --> 39:26.546
away their basic human rights
in order

39:26.623 --> 39:28.424
to take a class, so...
Okay, one more.

39:28.501 --> 39:29.934
Uh...

39:30.011 --> 39:32.774
"Professor Neill is super
dreamy. He's a PILF."

39:32.851 --> 39:34.937
P‐I‐L‐F. What's a PILF?
I honestly don't know.

39:35.014 --> 39:36.774
I don't read these comments.
I don't care.

39:36.851 --> 39:39.738
But you did "eff"
a student, right?

39:39.815 --> 39:42.167
‐

39:42.244 --> 39:44.832
Any chance you had
a sexual relationship

39:44.909 --> 39:47.588
with the student you... you used

39:47.665 --> 39:51.394
for a source in your article?

39:51.471 --> 39:53.121
Of course not.
That would be unethical.

39:53.190 --> 39:54.484
Right, right.

39:54.561 --> 39:58.241
Because that's, in fact,
what cult leaders do, right?

39:58.318 --> 40:00.572
They exploit people
who are vulnerable,

40:00.649 --> 40:05.464
maybe just lost a parent
or are going through a divorce.

40:05.541 --> 40:07.760
You're writing a book, right?

40:07.837 --> 40:10.409
To spread your gospel, hoping
to publish it this spring

40:10.478 --> 40:11.705
I think you said.

40:11.774 --> 40:12.784
I don't know,
it just sounds like

40:12.853 --> 40:15.310
you're a little bit of
a cult leader yourself, no?

40:17.022 --> 40:18.900

Mr. Roberts.
