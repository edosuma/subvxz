01:30.966 --> 01:32.133
Dick Whitman , you watch where you're going .

01:32.217 --> 01:33.468
You're going to break your neck.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.892
You going to cry or get up?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.480
I'm getting up, Uncle Mack.

01:45.564 --> 01:48.107
Good . There's someone
who wants to meet you .

01:51.236 --> 01:52.987
What are you afraid of?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.989
There was lots of screaming.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.324
Always is.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.661
The Lord has given us a blessing .

02:00.746 --> 02:02.997
You have a new brother.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.000
He ain't my brother.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.003
Of course he is.
He got the same daddy.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.588
Isn't he beautiful?

02:10.672 --> 02:14.050
I named him Adam after the first man .

02:26.355 --> 02:27.355
Daddy!

02:29.107 --> 02:30.149
Don , are you all right?

02:35.572 --> 02:37.114
Happy Mother's Day.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.419
This is fascinating .

03:31.503 --> 03:33.504
It's better than the Hollywood version .

03:33.589 --> 03:36.132
It's certainly dirtier.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.176
Well, Joan Crawford is not what she was.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.387
You know, honestly,

03:41.471 --> 03:44.515
I found her eyebrows completely unnerving,

03:44.600 --> 03:46.100
like a couple of. . .

03:46.184 --> 03:49.186
caterpillars just pasted there.

03:50.480 --> 03:55.735
Her standing next to Suzy Parker
as if they were the same species.

03:55.819 --> 03:59.113
Well, some men like eyebrows,

03:59.197 --> 04:01.908
and all men like Joan Crawford .

04:01.992 --> 04:05.119
Salvatore couldn't stop talking about her.

04:05.203 --> 04:11.918
To think, one of the great beauties,
and there she is, so old .

04:12.002 --> 04:15.004
I'd just like to disappear at that point.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.381
It makes perfect sense.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.885
I promise you , Bets,

04:20.969 --> 04:25.056
the first sign of crow's feet,
and I'll put you on an ice floe.

04:25.140 --> 04:28.142
Or would you prefer to be
my gal in the iron mask?

04:31.355 --> 04:33.147
Did you have a nice Mother's Day?

04:34.232 --> 04:36.233
It was lovely.

04:38.236 --> 04:42.156
My mother was at least two years older
than whatever Joan Crawford says she is,

04:42.240 --> 04:45.284
and she was still very fetching .

04:47.162 --> 04:49.163
I'd like to think that
she'd stand up very well

04:49.247 --> 04:52.166
as a prediction of my
eventual appearance.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.211
Bets, don't.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.924
No melancholy.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.344
I'm allowed to be sentimental
on Mother's Day.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.221
But it's your Mother's Day, not hers.

05:05.305 --> 05:09.266
I'm just saying that my mother
looked handsome.

05:10.394 --> 05:13.896
Actually, vivacious
and positively cheerful,

05:13.981 --> 05:15.940
right up to her end .

05:17.275 --> 05:19.151
It's good remembrance.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.737
Dr. Wayne suggested a book which . . .

05:21.822 --> 05:25.950
says that it's part
of the mourning process.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.828
Dr. Wayne.

05:28.912 --> 05:32.206
I do think it's helping .

05:32.290 --> 05:34.333
So you're cured?

05:34.418 --> 05:36.711
I don't know how they tell that.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.088
When their vacation house is paid for.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.717
Don't deride him .

05:46.596 --> 05:50.391
Mourning is just extended self-pity.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.769
In New Guinea,

05:53.854 --> 06:01.235
pygmies grind up their ancestors
and drink the powder in a beer.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.864
And a model culture at that, pygmies.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.491
Did you know Michelangelo
was painting the Sistine ceiling

06:07.576 --> 06:12.872
when those people were still
living in caves discovering fire?

06:12.956 --> 06:15.166
I didn't know that.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.834
Well , it's true.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.336
Introduction to Basic Anthropology.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.924
What about. . .

06:24.009 --> 06:26.260
Advanced Reproduction?

06:26.344 --> 06:29.221
How are your studies
progressing in that?

06:29.306 --> 06:31.432
Completed .

06:31.516 --> 06:33.893
I got an A, actually.

06:33.977 --> 06:34.977
You did?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.896
Yep, I did .

06:36.980 --> 06:39.315
I flunked the whole thing .

06:39.399 --> 06:42.234
Well, that's because
you got caught cheating .

06:54.372 --> 06:55.664
Get the light.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.015
I want you so much .

07:14.392 --> 07:15.976
I thought about it all day.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.394
Me, too.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.398
No, I mean it.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.821
It's all I think about. . .

07:26.905 --> 07:28.280
every day.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.327
Your car coming down the driveway.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.414
I put the kids to bed early.

07:38.917 --> 07:42.169
I make a grocery list.
I cook butterscotch pudding .

07:43.797 --> 07:45.256
I never let my hands idle.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.465
Brushing my hair,

07:46.550 --> 07:49.802
drinking my milk. . .

07:49.886 --> 07:52.179
and it's all in a kind of fog

07:52.264 --> 07:54.932
because I can't stop
thinking about this.

07:59.855 --> 08:02.439
I want you so badly.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.445
You have me.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.617
You do.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.399
Ah , Don .

08:45.483 --> 08:47.902
You remember N ick Rodis
from Olympic Cruise Lines.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.904
N ick, did you ever add
that second deck of portholes?

08:49.988 --> 08:53.115
Yes, but those rooms get pretty wet.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.328
This is U rine Ben Shulhai
from The Israel Ministry of Tourism .

08:57.412 --> 08:58.537
It is pronounced "Yoram ."

08:58.622 --> 08:59.622
Of course.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.415
And this young lady is Lily Meyer.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.750
Pleasure to meet you .

09:02.834 --> 09:04.293
And you .

09:04.377 --> 09:07.254
Caviar, blinis, mai tais.

09:07.339 --> 09:10.257
We're thinking of a land of exotic luxury.

09:10.342 --> 09:13.219
We'd like to think that if Beirut
is the Paris of the M iddle East,

09:13.303 --> 09:15.054
Haifa can be the Rome.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.639
It's an exciting idea.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.057
Of course we should keep in mind

09:18.141 --> 09:21.435
that Paris has the Eiffel Tower
and Rome has the Coliseum .

09:21.519 --> 09:23.896
And Tel Avenue is about to have a Hilton .

09:23.980 --> 09:26.232
Olympic is charting
our most luxurious liner

09:26.316 --> 09:29.818
all along the wondrous ports
of the Israeli Riviera.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.447
We are going to visit
Mr. Bernbach down the street,

09:33.531 --> 09:36.450
but some of us
find his humor to be kitsch.

09:36.534 --> 09:39.954
We thought we would try
a traditional way as well .

09:40.038 --> 09:43.874
Sterling Cooper doesn't
like to think of itself as traditional.

09:43.959 --> 09:48.963
Maybe that is the wrong word .
My English is not so good .

09:49.047 --> 09:51.674
Glamour, like glamorous-- that's the word .

09:51.758 --> 09:53.467
We saw your awards.

09:53.551 --> 09:56.220
We were impressed
with your work on Rio de Janeiro.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.554
You're not thinking of putting

09:57.639 --> 10:01.225
a 1 50-foot statue of Jesus
in Tel Aviv, are you?

10:01.309 --> 10:03.185
Because that's how we sold Rio.

10:03.270 --> 10:07.314
This book has been
on the best-seller list

10:07.399 --> 10:09.191
for two years in the States,

10:09.317 --> 10:12.528
and is soon to be a major motion picture
starring Paul Newman .

10:12.612 --> 10:17.449
America has a love affair with Israel ,

10:17.534 --> 10:21.203
and we would like to bring
the two parties together.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.540
Well, you certainly
saved me some legwork.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.250
All I have is the Bible.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.210
Let's stay away from that.

10:31.339 --> 10:35.009
So, your ideal tourist.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.635
What's his yearly salary?

10:38.471 --> 10:39.722
Whatever you make.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.391
They always say that.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.907
Well, look who's here:
a couple of angels.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.534
Do we have lunch today?

11:00.618 --> 11:03.495
No, darling, we're going
to get Margaret a haircut.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.913
A haircut?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.540
Oh , I like your ponytail, squirt.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.666
It makes you look young.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.628
I like your hair, Daddy.
It makes you look old .

11:13.631 --> 11:15.758
We just have to find the right place.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.010
Ginger?

11:18.094 --> 11:19.762
I cut my own hair.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.390
You picked her.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.935
Don't you two make a handsome couple.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.271
Honestly, I don't go for handsome.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.441
Mona, Margaret.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.568
What brings you below 59th Street?

11:34.652 --> 11:35.861
Margaret, say hello.

11:37.614 --> 11:40.532
Hello, Mr. Draper.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.202
Oh , Mona, aren't you lucky?

11:43.286 --> 11:45.037
Mother and daughter on the town .

11:45.121 --> 11:47.581
Where are the girls
getting their hair done these days?

11:47.665 --> 11:49.416
By girls, you mean Brigitte Bardot?

11:49.501 --> 11:51.043
Because that's what I'm seeing .

11:51.127 --> 11:54.296
As long as she can pin
a hat on it for church .

11:54.381 --> 11:56.131
You are going to love this man .

11:56.216 --> 11:57.883
I will make you an appointment. Come on .

11:59.052 --> 12:00.052
Bye, Don .

12:00.136 --> 12:03.222
Roger, sweetheart.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.683
She used to love being in my office.

12:08.853 --> 12:12.564
Her haircut is the least
of Margaret's problems.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.609
She's dated what, two boys?

12:15.693 --> 12:18.904
One of them joined the service,
the other one committed suicide.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.866
She doesn't want to go to college.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.326
Doesn't want to work.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.911
Not interested in charity.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.498
I don't know what we did wrong .

12:29.582 --> 12:32.501
We gave her everything she wanted ,
and she's still useless.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.627
You're being too hard on her.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.963
She's a young girl .

12:36.047 --> 12:38.048
When I was her age,
I rode a tramp steamer

12:38.133 --> 12:39.633
from Bar Harbor to Hilton Head .

12:39.717 --> 12:41.051
I bet it was a yacht.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.637
Someone still has to sail those things.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.472
I think Margaret reminds you of you .

12:45.557 --> 12:46.765
You're both spoiled .

12:46.850 --> 12:47.975
Zip.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.731
Come back to bed .

12:54.816 --> 12:57.276
We can stay here all afternoon .

12:57.360 --> 12:59.111
You don't have to go back to work.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.946
I do. Zip.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.451
You like the pearl necklace I gave you?

13:05.535 --> 13:06.577
It's gorgeous.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.874
Aren't you even going to have any of this?

13:11.958 --> 13:16.670
Look, we've got Oysters Rockefeller,
Beef Wellington, Napoleons.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.882
If we leave this lunch alone,
it'll take over Europe.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.675
I don't like eating in here.

13:21.759 --> 13:25.846
Food that close to the bed
reminds me of a hospital .

13:25.930 --> 13:28.098
If you had your own apartment,
we could go to your place.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.683
You could cook for me.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.061
Don't you like things the way they are?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.105
Are you kidding?

13:35.190 --> 13:38.108
This has been the best year of my life.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.318
Do you have any idea

13:39.402 --> 13:41.737
how unhappy I was before I met you?

13:43.781 --> 13:45.908
I was thinking of leaving my wife.

13:48.912 --> 13:53.999
I'm just getting tired of all the. . .
sneaking around .

13:54.083 --> 13:55.751
Aren't you?

13:56.920 --> 14:00.172
Roger, I know as much about men
as you know about advertising ,

14:00.256 --> 14:03.550
and I know that the sneaking around
is your favorite part.

14:03.635 --> 14:07.513
You know, I have a lot of favorite parts.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.933
I'd like to get you . . .

14:11.017 --> 14:13.060
a little fourth floor walk-up somewhere

14:13.144 --> 14:15.562
with no doors, no windows,

14:15.647 --> 14:17.814
and lock you up for a week.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.735
That's tempting .

14:21.819 --> 14:24.613
But I like hotels.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.449
You leave with what you came in with .

14:27.534 --> 14:30.077
And little soaps. I love those.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.830
I wish I knew what you wanted , Joanie.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.376
I love this, Roger,

14:37.502 --> 14:42.589
but a week is a considerable length of time,
and I have my own world .

14:42.674 --> 14:46.385
I go out, and I have parties,
and I have friends over--

14:46.469 --> 14:48.011
Male friends?

14:48.096 --> 14:49.471
Yes.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.681
I don't want to hear this.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.058
Carol and I have this nice little rotation .

14:53.142 --> 14:55.894
Carol . The disaster.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.729
I've known Carol since college,

14:57.814 --> 14:59.147
and she's been a good friend ,

14:59.232 --> 15:01.692
and she's bright, and she's neat.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.859
So you think you'd be lonely.

15:04.195 --> 15:07.072
I think it would be
half as much fun alone.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.782
You could get a bird .

15:08.866 --> 15:10.909
They're fairly neat for animals.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.417
Roger, if you had your way,

15:18.501 --> 15:20.502
I would be stranded
in some paperweight

15:20.587 --> 15:22.421
with my legs stuck in the air.

15:22.505 --> 15:23.797
Wait, wait, wait.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.632
You're just gonna paint
that picture and go, huh?

15:30.638 --> 15:34.516
Can't we. . .just enjoy this?

15:34.601 --> 15:41.898
I mean, we both know I'll eventually find
a more permanent situation ,

15:41.983 --> 15:46.820
and you'll find a new model.

15:46.904 --> 15:50.282
The '61 s are coming out soon .

15:50.366 --> 15:53.410
I hear the fins are bigger next year.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.456
Whatever you want, Red .

16:19.646 --> 16:21.772
I see why they want the guns.

16:21.856 --> 16:22.856
It's tough to compete

16:22.940 --> 16:25.817
with Bermuda only three hours away.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.362
It helps if they stop blowing up hotels.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.365
Oh, kill me, you busty Jewess.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.994
Maybe we should try and exploit
the danger instead of fighting it.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.704
Travel as adventure.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.122
Or how about this?

16:39.207 --> 16:43.669
Average American family of three
standing on shore, suitcases in hand .

16:43.753 --> 16:45.420
The Red Sea parts before them .

16:45.505 --> 16:49.132
On the other side
waits a gleaming four-star resort.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.093
Shouldn't you see the Promised Land?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.011
Take religion out.

16:53.096 --> 16:56.181
They've got plenty of
Stations of the Cross traffic.

16:56.265 --> 16:59.101
I've skimmed this research,
and the whole thing's pretty red .

16:59.185 --> 17:02.854
These communes, kibbutzes.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.022
It's positively Soviet.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.901
Except the Daughters
of the American Revolution

17:07.985 --> 17:09.778
are shuttling this book
up and down Fifth Avenue.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.071
It's a good story.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.322
They start in these prison camps.

17:12.407 --> 17:13.865
Like, real prisoners.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.910
Then the next thing you know,
they're in the desert, armed to the teeth ,

17:16.994 --> 17:20.122
cutting their way through the enemy,
dying for the cause.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.915
And then they have a government.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.625
A commie government.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.711
Made my mother cry.

17:25.795 --> 17:30.590
So, we have a quasi-communist state
where women have guns,

17:30.675 --> 17:32.175
and it's filled with Jews.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.719
Well, not completely filled .

17:33.803 --> 17:35.554
Let's not forget that there are also Arabs.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.180
They've got oranges.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.682
As far as I can see,

17:38.766 --> 17:41.351
the biggest thing
this place has going for it:

17:41.436 --> 17:44.104
the people are good-looking .

17:44.188 --> 17:47.023
The Jews there don't
look like the Jews here.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.735
Have you been to the Diamond District?

17:52.905 --> 17:54.614
All right. I have to make
a couple phone calls.

17:54.699 --> 17:55.824
Let's pick this up later.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.331
Peggy, will you get me
a private line, please?

18:03.416 --> 18:05.292
Right away, Mr. Draper.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.603
Donald Draper, Line 2.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.990
I debated not taking the call .

18:37.074 --> 18:40.410
I'm glad you did . I need to see you .

18:40.495 --> 18:42.412
I don't think that's a good idea.

18:43.706 --> 18:44.873
It's business.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.458
Meet me for a drink.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.001
I'm busy this evening .

18:48.085 --> 18:50.003
I wouldn't have called
if it wasn't important.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.464
I should still be able to talk to you .

18:52.548 --> 18:54.090
Give me credit for that.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.637
Lunch . Tomorrow.

18:58.721 --> 18:59.888
Lunch .

19:01.098 --> 19:03.475
The Tea Room at The Pierre, 1 2: 1 5.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.018
Message received .

19:27.625 --> 19:30.460
Oh , it's so muggy tonight.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.924
Did you just get a library card?

19:36.008 --> 19:37.217
I rarely see you read anything

19:37.301 --> 19:40.136
that doesn't have a manila folder
wrapped around it.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.474
You should clean the gutters.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.935
This weekend .

19:47.019 --> 19:49.145
Is that good?

19:50.439 --> 19:52.983
There's less action than I thought.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.151
I thought it was a romance.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.905
You know, the first boy
I ever kissed was Jewish .

20:01.158 --> 20:02.701
How did that happen?

20:02.785 --> 20:06.079
My friend Deirdre Shaw
was friends with a Jewish girl,

20:06.163 --> 20:10.959
Beth. . .Gold , Silver, or something .

20:11.043 --> 20:15.422
Beth invited us to a mixer
at her synagogue in Lower Merion .

20:15.506 --> 20:17.173
I'm surprised your mother let you go.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.595
Well , it was a fundraiser for charity.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.180
Those poor skinny people in the boats.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.100
This boy danced with me all evening .

20:27.184 --> 20:29.978
David Rosenberg .

20:30.062 --> 20:32.022
He was very good-looking ,

20:32.106 --> 20:35.108
but there was something
about him that was gloomy.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.485
Was he a good kisser?

20:39.155 --> 20:41.948
Let's just say he had
more practice than I did .

20:42.033 --> 20:44.576
Yeah , I'm sure he was very disappointed .

20:44.660 --> 20:46.494
Oh, please, The only
reason he picked me

20:46.579 --> 20:48.413
is because I wasn't
part of the synagogue.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.290
In fact, the next day, on the school bus,

20:50.374 --> 20:53.710
Beth told everyone I was necking
with David Rosenberg .

20:53.794 --> 20:55.503
The looks they gave me.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.135
They were all blondes by the next summer.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.230
Honey, it's hot.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.193
And I have to read this book about the desert.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.363
Of course.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.822
Go ahead .

21:27.244 --> 21:29.120
We should get
an air conditioner up here.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.498
We'll see.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.591
H iya, fellas. Come on in .

21:41.676 --> 21:43.301
Did you see this?

21:43.386 --> 21:45.220
Someone broke into
the Yankees' equipment locker

21:45.304 --> 21:46.346
in Cleveland yesterday.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.348
Swiped Mickey Mantle's pet glove.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.308
Huh . They should have taken his bat.

21:50.393 --> 21:53.478
Shall we wait for you
to have your breakfast?

21:53.562 --> 21:56.648
A day without orange juice
is a hell of a long day.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.316
Hey, look, Ma, no hands.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.112
"Belle Jolie"?

22:02.196 --> 22:04.406
Yeah , I've been looking at the work
of our esteemed predecessors.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.199
I'm not heartened .

22:06.283 --> 22:07.575
They make more colors of lipstick

22:07.660 --> 22:09.452
than Howard Johnson
has ice cream flavors,

22:09.537 --> 22:11.496
but their sales are in the crapper.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.872
These names.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.541
Passion Flower Peach,

22:14.625 --> 22:16.209
Tropical Boudoir Red .

22:16.293 --> 22:18.211
And look, Ethel Rosenberg Pink.

22:18.295 --> 22:21.214
Wear it to the chair.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.216
Did you know that lipstick was invented

22:23.300 --> 22:27.220
to simulate the flush on a woman's face
after you treated her right?

22:27.304 --> 22:30.223
If you're going to quote
the research report,

22:30.307 --> 22:31.808
don't start with "Did you know?"

22:36.272 --> 22:37.564
Research , I'm stumped .

22:37.648 --> 22:40.233
I'll be honest. I don't speak Moron .

22:40.317 --> 22:42.318
Do either of you speak Moron?

22:46.323 --> 22:48.700
Let's throw it to the chickens.

22:48.784 --> 22:52.203
Okay, girls, come on in .

22:52.288 --> 22:54.330
Come on in, ladies. Gather around .

22:59.003 --> 23:00.587
Settle down .

23:00.671 --> 23:02.213
What, no lunch?

23:02.298 --> 23:04.799
No, dear. This is better.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.259
Belle Jolie wants us to tell them

23:06.343 --> 23:09.012
what we think about their
new line of lipsticks.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.187
One-way glass.

23:17.271 --> 23:19.481
That name seem weird to you?

23:19.565 --> 23:21.316
Should be two-way glass, right?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.276
I don't care what they call it.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.779
Beats the hell out of X-ray Specs.

23:27.740 --> 23:28.823
It's called brainstorming .

23:28.908 --> 23:30.283
That sounds intimidating .

23:30.367 --> 23:32.118
Is it like a test?

23:32.203 --> 23:33.286
There are no wrong answers.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.454
You just be your pretty little selves.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.373
Grab a lipstick,
grab a mirror, and sit down .

23:41.504 --> 23:43.838
Oh, this one's too red for me.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.676
And remember, the mirror
could be your best friend

23:48.761 --> 23:51.304
or your worst enemy.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.142
Has no taste.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.270
Ugly dress.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.734
Horrible wig .

24:07.404 --> 24:09.197
They're brainstorming.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.367
I wouldn't expect more
than a few sprinkles.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.369
I love it when they do that.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.037
My little blowfish .

24:19.416 --> 24:21.751
Anybody mind if I take off my pants?

24:25.422 --> 24:27.215
The red one's for me.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.800
How many lipsticks do you own?

24:28.884 --> 24:30.593
Gee, I don't know.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.554
I'd have to go home and count.

24:32.638 --> 24:37.809
Do you match your lip color
to your clothing or to your accessories?

24:37.893 --> 24:39.853
I know. That seems
like a loaded question .

24:39.937 --> 24:42.063
It is unloaded,

24:42.148 --> 24:44.858
and I insist you curb
your editorial comments.

24:44.942 --> 24:47.402
Sometimes I match it to my nail polish .

24:47.486 --> 24:50.363
Good answer. Go ahead .

24:50.447 --> 24:52.699
Do you change your lip color
with the seasons?

24:54.451 --> 24:56.828
You , stand over there.

25:06.213 --> 25:09.424
At what point do we start running electricity
through the chairs?

25:09.508 --> 25:13.178
You should have put a man in there
so they'd take it seriously.

25:15.806 --> 25:16.806
Good .

25:16.891 --> 25:18.516
I was afraid I'd missed it.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.911
I want to stand and salute that.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.299
What's with Mouse Ears over there?

27:00.536 --> 27:02.412
Thanks for coming.

27:02.496 --> 27:03.496
Can I get you anything?

27:03.580 --> 27:04.831
No.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.420
How've you been?

27:10.504 --> 27:11.504
Fine.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.047
Tired .

27:14.508 --> 27:15.591
It doesn't show.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.805
I'm in the middle of spring inventory.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.515
I hope you're not going to tell me

27:22.599 --> 27:25.768
that the grand plan
for remaking our store has a hitch in it.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.605
You look beautiful.

27:29.690 --> 27:32.734
I thought you had
urgent business to discuss.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.445
Anything for the lady?

27:35.529 --> 27:37.613
Nothing for me-- Mmm , coffee.

27:37.698 --> 27:38.698
Irish coffee?

27:38.782 --> 27:40.074
Coffee.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.160
Yes, sir.

27:45.748 --> 27:47.081
Business?

27:49.335 --> 27:54.005
It turns out Israel Tourism
is considering becoming a client,

27:54.089 --> 27:56.341
and I'm having a hard time
getting a handle on it.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.551
And I'm the only Jew
you know in New York City?

27:58.635 --> 28:00.553
You're my favorite.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.556
Jesus, Don , crack a book once in a while.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.016
I have.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.769
It's all sentimental World War I I trivia,

28:07.853 --> 28:10.563
oranges, kids in blue and white hats.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.648
They're doing a movie of Exodus
with Paul Newman .

28:12.733 --> 28:15.109
Paul Newman? That's nice.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.652
Now I have two reasons to see it.

28:18.655 --> 28:19.864
Damn it.

28:24.078 --> 28:26.245
You're usually so put together.

28:33.462 --> 28:34.670
Thank you .

28:38.550 --> 28:41.594
I'll say one thing about Israelis.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.221
Don't cross them .

28:44.640 --> 28:48.601
Well, those people at the meeting
were definitely Zionists.

28:48.685 --> 28:52.063
Zion just means Israel.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.940
It's a very old name.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.235
I'm sorry. I'm not an expert on this,

28:57.319 --> 28:59.362
and something feels strange
about being treated like one.

28:59.446 --> 29:00.988
I just want to know something about it

29:01.073 --> 29:03.574
that doesn't come from
some ministry of propaganda.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.619
Well, here's some more
World War I I trivia.

29:06.703 --> 29:09.205
They just arrested Adolf Eichmann
in Argentina last week.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.498
Have you seen his resume?

29:11.750 --> 29:14.335
Okay, I deserved that.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.922
But I'm talking about
tourists going to Israel.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.966
I don't know what I can say.

29:20.050 --> 29:24.220
I'm American.
I'm really not very Jewish .

29:24.304 --> 29:26.264
If my mother hadn't died having me,

29:26.348 --> 29:28.266
I could have been Marilyn
instead of Rachel .

29:28.350 --> 29:29.642
No one would know the difference.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.018
What is the difference?

29:34.189 --> 29:39.026
Look, Jews have lived
in exile for a long time:

29:39.111 --> 29:40.736
first in Babylon ,

29:40.821 --> 29:44.532
then all over the world-- Shanghai, Brooklyn--

29:44.616 --> 29:48.661
and we've managed to make a go of it.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.163
Maybe it has something to do

29:50.247 --> 29:51.873
with the fact that we
thrive at doing business

29:51.957 --> 29:53.749
with people who hate us.

29:56.378 --> 29:57.712
I don't hate you .

29:59.006 --> 30:01.340
No. Individuals are wonderful.

30:01.425 --> 30:02.758
That's not what I meant.

30:04.595 --> 30:05.761
I don't know.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.182
A country. . .

30:09.266 --> 30:11.392
for "those people," as you call us,

30:11.477 --> 30:13.686
well. . .

30:13.770 --> 30:15.480
it seems very important.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.525
Then why aren't you there?

30:19.610 --> 30:21.611
My life is here.

30:21.695 --> 30:23.696
My grandfather came from Russia,

30:23.780 --> 30:25.698
now we have a store on Fifth Avenue.

30:25.782 --> 30:28.326
I'll visit, but I don't have to live there.

30:28.410 --> 30:31.787
It just. . .has to be.

30:33.582 --> 30:36.375
For me, it's more
of an idea than a place.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.920
Utopia.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.798
Maybe.

30:49.389 --> 30:52.058
They taught us at Barnard about that word .

30:52.142 --> 30:54.477
Utopia.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.731
The Greeks had two meanings for it:

30:58.815 --> 31:00.107
"eu-topos, "

31:00.192 --> 31:02.443
meaning "the good place,"

31:02.528 --> 31:05.738
and"ou-topos,"

31:05.822 --> 31:08.741
meaning "the place that cannot be."

31:13.455 --> 31:15.831
I have to get back to the office.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.757
I better not see this on my bill.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.222
Okay, girls, playtime's over.

31:31.306 --> 31:34.058
Time to put down your lipsticks
and head back to your desks.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.852
Thank you for your cooperation
and your lips.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.564
These go in the closet.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.990
Well, now we have to count
the shades they tried .

31:49.074 --> 31:51.492
Can you bring me those tissues, dear?

31:54.997 --> 31:57.456
Here's your basket of kisses.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.500
Basket of kisses.

31:59.585 --> 32:00.793
That's cute.

32:00.877 --> 32:02.461
Who told you that?

32:02.546 --> 32:05.006
What do you mean?

32:05.090 --> 32:06.716
Where did you hear that?

32:06.800 --> 32:08.509
I just thought of it.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.970
Isn't that what it is?

32:12.389 --> 32:15.182
It is, sweetheart.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.809
Which color did you like?

32:16.893 --> 32:18.561
I didn't get the one I liked .

32:18.645 --> 32:20.271
Someone took my color.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.856
Why didn't you choose another one?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.816
I'm very particular.

32:23.900 --> 32:27.028
As opposed to the other girls?

32:27.112 --> 32:29.405
I don't know.

32:29.489 --> 32:33.826
I don't think anyone wants to be
one of a hundred colors in a box.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.536
I think that's enough complaining .

32:35.621 --> 32:37.830
Why don't you head
back to your desk, Peggy?

32:41.668 --> 32:45.588
Bet you wish you could pour
that in a glass and drink it.

33:03.065 --> 33:06.359
Peggy, clear the rest of my afternoon,
would you , please?

33:06.443 --> 33:09.820
You have the Snider's
Catsup people at 3:00.

33:09.946 --> 33:13.741
Have a box of cigars sent over to Jim King
with my apologies.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.660
I'll find out what he smokes.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.161
Good girl .

33:18.622 --> 33:19.872
You got a minute, Chief?

33:19.956 --> 33:21.832
Just.

33:21.917 --> 33:22.917
You don't mind , do you?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.502
Use a glass, Freddie.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.381
Your girl is full of surprises.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.883
Oh , pretty Peggy Sue.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.885
Peggy?

33:32.969 --> 33:34.887
If you say so.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.889
I try to avoid eye contact

33:36.973 --> 33:38.974
to avoid being blinded
by the earnestness.

33:40.811 --> 33:43.896
Actually, she really stood out,
brainstorming-wise.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.731
Brainstorming?

33:45.816 --> 33:47.024
Sorry I missed that.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.859
What was the line?

33:48.944 --> 33:50.528
A bucket of kisses.

33:50.612 --> 33:51.821
Basket of kisses.

33:51.905 --> 33:52.905
Bucket sounds better.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.365
If you like 'em wet and sloppy.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.617
The point is,

33:56.702 --> 33:59.662
while the rest of the hens were busy
pulling out each other's feathers,

33:59.746 --> 34:01.789
that one saw the benefit, not the feature.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.124
Really?

34:03.208 --> 34:07.002
Yeah . She said she didn't want to be one
of a hundred colors in a box.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.923
That's interesting , isn't it?

34:11.007 --> 34:13.300
It is.

34:13.385 --> 34:17.096
It was like watching a dog play the piano.

34:27.441 --> 34:28.941
It's me, Barbara. Can you talk?

34:29.025 --> 34:30.985
She's still sleeping , thank God .

34:31.069 --> 34:32.236
What's on your mind?

34:32.320 --> 34:35.322
I think I might have met somebody.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.242
You're not sure? That's good .

34:38.326 --> 34:41.412
He has some serious limitations.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.955
Does he work in the store?

34:43.039 --> 34:45.166
No, he doesn't work at the store.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.959
He has a job, doesn't he?

34:47.043 --> 34:48.335
Yes.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.795
Then what's the problem?

34:49.880 --> 34:51.338
Would Daddy like him?

34:52.883 --> 34:53.966
Daddy would hate him .

34:54.050 --> 34:55.843
So he's not Jewish .

34:59.431 --> 35:00.681
Who cares what Daddy thinks?

35:00.766 --> 35:03.434
He's not your boyfriend anymore.

35:03.518 --> 35:04.643
Barbara.

35:04.728 --> 35:05.978
You're 28 years old .

35:06.062 --> 35:07.229
You work 60 hours a week.

35:07.314 --> 35:09.774
The last thing you want
is to end up like Aunt Rosie,

35:09.858 --> 35:11.984
lying to your nieces about
how many engagements you had .

35:12.068 --> 35:13.986
Aunt Rosie wasn't lying .

35:14.070 --> 35:16.071
Oh , please, there was
no Max the Communist.

35:16.156 --> 35:18.407
Does he have all his hair?

35:18.492 --> 35:19.950
More than he'll ever need .

35:20.035 --> 35:21.452
Is he funny?

35:21.536 --> 35:24.538
Sometimes. After a couple.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.000
So he's a shikker. Daddy will hate him .

35:28.084 --> 35:31.504
I do feel this attraction .

35:31.588 --> 35:32.880
I want him ,

35:32.964 --> 35:35.007
and I want to ignore
everything else about him .

35:35.091 --> 35:37.635
It's 1 960. We don't live in a shtetl.

35:37.719 --> 35:38.928
We can marry for love.

35:39.012 --> 35:41.889
I'm not sure people do that anymore.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.391
Why do you always have to be so cynical?

35:46.770 --> 35:50.731
Because sometimes. , .
things come--

35:50.816 --> 35:51.941
good things--

35:52.025 --> 35:53.609
but there's no future in them .

35:53.693 --> 35:55.027
You're a modern woman, Rach.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.904
Forget the wedding.

35:56.988 --> 36:00.074
Believe me, I'd do anything
for some romance right now.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.001
Peggy.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.503
H i, Joan .

36:13.755 --> 36:17.049
Mr. Rumsen would like you
to put your industrious little mind

36:17.133 --> 36:19.718
towards coming up with copy
for Belle Jolie Lipsticks.

36:21.680 --> 36:22.680
I don't understand .

36:22.764 --> 36:24.056
They want me to write something?

36:24.140 --> 36:26.058
Whatever you said
in that brainstorming session

36:26.142 --> 36:28.143
apparently knocked their socks off.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.188
Oh , my gosh .

36:31.273 --> 36:32.731
I don't know what to say.

36:32.816 --> 36:35.192
You will, of course,
continue to cover Mr. Draper's desk.

36:35.277 --> 36:38.028
Any writing you do
will be on your own time.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.113
Do I get a raise?

36:39.197 --> 36:40.322
No.

36:40.407 --> 36:41.407
Congratulations.

36:41.491 --> 36:44.535
More work and more responsibility.

36:44.619 --> 36:47.413
I guess you'll be entitled
to some dinner money.

36:47.497 --> 36:49.123
That's swell.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.875
Maybe I should go and thank them?

36:52.168 --> 36:54.503
I'm not really dressed .
Tomorrow, maybe?

36:54.588 --> 36:56.755
No need .
They wanted me to tell you .

36:56.840 --> 36:58.299
They were very specific about it.

36:59.593 --> 37:03.220
Well, you know what they say:
the medium is the message.

37:19.905 --> 37:23.908
And here I was just wishing for a man
to help me with my yard work.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.751
Sorry.

37:33.835 --> 37:37.004
That's what I get for being domestic.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.381
Let's get this off.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.137
Oh, God , hold that.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.472
The thought.

37:58.777 --> 37:59.860
H i, Roy.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.362
Hi , beautiful .

38:03.114 --> 38:04.740
What's shakin'?

38:08.870 --> 38:10.746
Busy dance card , huh?

38:10.830 --> 38:13.791
U h , Roy, this is my friend Don Draper.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.168
Don , this is Roy Hazellit.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.252
Pleasure.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.172
Ian's playing down at the Gaslight.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.966
We're gonna go support him ,
pass the basket.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.051
You in?

38:24.135 --> 38:25.844
That is if Dad will let you out.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.179
Sounds like fun .

38:27.263 --> 38:29.223
Don, we should go down for a while.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.183
Come on . It'll be a kick.
What do you say?

38:31.267 --> 38:33.227
Afraid you'll miss the 5:31 ?

38:35.689 --> 38:37.106
I think I'm gonna stay here.

38:43.363 --> 38:47.408
I'll wear a skirt and nothing else.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.499
What took you so long?

38:55.583 --> 38:58.210
One of the media buyers
ambushed me in the elevator

38:58.294 --> 39:00.921
with tickets to the ballet, of all things.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.256
I told him I had plans,

39:02.340 --> 39:04.258
but he insisted we share
a cab across town anyways.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.342
I couldn't shake him .

39:05.427 --> 39:06.427
Which one was it?

39:06.511 --> 39:09.638
George Asbury. He's a hound .

39:09.723 --> 39:12.975
It doesn't matter.
They're all just boys.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.102
Poor bastard probably
couldn't help himself,

39:15.186 --> 39:19.314
the way you glide around that office
like some magnificent ship.

39:20.817 --> 39:23.235
Well, I don't want to be a distraction.

39:23.319 --> 39:27.364
Shall I , um , order horse blinders
for the rest of the office?

39:31.327 --> 39:34.163
You didn't.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.081
Oh, I sure did .

39:42.130 --> 39:45.424
Well , what am I supposed to do with it?

39:45.508 --> 39:48.969
The store lady said you can do anything
but put the cage on the radiator.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.180
You're terrible.

39:51.264 --> 39:53.599
Well , you can't blame a man for trying .

39:53.683 --> 39:56.769
I just hate the thought
of having to share you .

39:58.229 --> 40:01.356
You don't have to share me now.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.074
Joanie, you smell so good .

40:10.158 --> 40:12.576
I've been thinking about this all day.

40:12.660 --> 40:17.706
Mona is looking at a weekend
in Old Saybrook with the in-laws.

40:17.791 --> 40:20.417
There's not enough liquor in the world .

40:22.879 --> 40:24.379
Roger.

40:30.386 --> 40:31.887
Sorry.

40:44.025 --> 40:45.776
"Mary Katharine Cahill,

40:45.860 --> 40:48.320
"a daughter of Harriet M . Barr

40:48.404 --> 40:51.323
"and Archibald W. Barr
of Stonington, Connecticut,

40:51.407 --> 40:53.575
"and Kevin Mark Duncan I I I ,

40:53.660 --> 40:55.702
"a son of Beatrice Hoslinger

40:55.787 --> 40:58.705
"and Kevin Mark Duncan, Jr. ,
of Manhattan,

40:58.790 --> 41:00.332
"were married last evening

41:00.416 --> 41:02.626
at the Episcopal Church
of the Heavenly Rest."

41:02.710 --> 41:04.253
He travels around the country

41:04.337 --> 41:06.672
and collects miniature
replicas of monuments--

41:06.756 --> 41:09.341
Washington Memorial,
Bunker Hill, Mount Rushmore--

41:09.425 --> 41:12.010
and then he sticks them up his ass.

41:12.095 --> 41:14.012
Symbolism intended .

41:14.097 --> 41:16.849
No place to put your coat.

41:20.770 --> 41:22.020
Switch seats with me.

41:22.105 --> 41:23.355
No way.

41:23.439 --> 41:24.982
Can we get a round over here?

41:25.066 --> 41:26.692
Jack Daniels, Duchess.

41:26.776 --> 41:28.944
Sounds like a great idea.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.321
Anyway, turns out this Spanish cat and I

41:31.447 --> 41:34.241
are mucho simpatico
with the direction we talked about going .

41:34.325 --> 41:35.742
With the "Theater of the People" thing?

41:35.827 --> 41:36.827
Conscious drama.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.996
Not the soulless bullshit

41:39.080 --> 41:40.873
kept alive by the middle class

41:40.957 --> 41:43.542
with their season tickets
to Dick Van Dyke and Mary Martin .

41:43.626 --> 41:45.460
I bet Don here can tell you firsthand .

41:45.545 --> 41:47.379
Broadway is the birthplace
of mediocrity.

41:47.463 --> 41:50.132
"The groom wore a matching boutonnière
of sweetheart roses."

41:50.216 --> 41:51.842
Well , maybe it's born there,

41:51.926 --> 41:54.511
but I think it may be conceived right here.

41:54.596 --> 41:56.054
"The couple will
honeymoon in Jamaica,

41:56.139 --> 41:58.473
and take up residence in Rye, New York."

42:09.235 --> 42:11.278
Thank you , Don .

42:11.362 --> 42:12.738
L'chaim .

42:14.073 --> 42:16.241
So what do you do, Don?

42:16.326 --> 42:17.659
I blow up bridges.

42:17.744 --> 42:20.412
Don's in advertising .

42:20.496 --> 42:21.663
No way.

42:21.748 --> 42:24.249
Madison Avenue? What a gas.

42:24.334 --> 42:26.001
We all have to serve somebody.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.880
Perpetuating the lie.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.423
How do you sleep at night?

42:31.507 --> 42:33.258
On a bed made of money.

42:33.343 --> 42:36.345
Isn't this an education?

42:36.429 --> 42:41.016
You hucksters in your tower created
the religion of mass consumption .

42:41.142 --> 42:46.438
People want to be told what to do so badly
that they'll listen to anyone.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.023
When you say people,

42:48.107 --> 42:50.275
I have a feeling you're
talking about thou .

42:50.360 --> 42:52.110
And I have a feeling

42:52.195 --> 42:55.447
that you spent more time
on your hair this morning than she did .

42:55.531 --> 42:58.867
You two want to head
to the urinals and poke it out?

43:01.537 --> 43:02.621
So, Roy,

43:02.705 --> 43:05.457
if you had a job. . .

43:05.541 --> 43:07.209
what would you do?

43:07.293 --> 43:10.295
I'm starting a theater,
right here in the Village.

43:10.380 --> 43:11.588
It's a cooperative.

43:11.673 --> 43:14.466
Midge is going to get in there,
paint some flats.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.635
I said I'd think about it.

43:16.719 --> 43:19.805
Last night I dreamed

43:19.889 --> 43:25.477
of making love to Fidel Castro
in a king-size bed

43:25.561 --> 43:28.563
at the Waldorf-Astoria.

43:28.648 --> 43:32.526
" Viva la revolución!"he roared ,

43:32.610 --> 43:35.487
