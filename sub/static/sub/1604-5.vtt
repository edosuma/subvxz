if you wanna save that man's life,

At 4:00 am,
Dechambou left Seth

35:52.859 --> 35:55.726
in the back of a pickup truck
at this rest stop in Manassas.

35:55.945 --> 35:59.108

the proof of life video at 4:29 am,

35:59.324 --> 36:00.905
just under 30 minutes later.

Assume he spent 20 minutes
minimum with Seth at the site.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.869
That would give him 10 minutes
from the rest stop.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.532
