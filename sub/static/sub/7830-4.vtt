<i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

00:07.048 --> 00:07.966
(tires screech)

00:09.342 --> 00:10.760
D'oh!

00:10.844 --> 00:12.762
-(screams)
-(tires screech)

00:37.454 --> 00:40.874
What a perfect outing
for a beautiful autumn day.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.209
I feel sorry for everyone
who's cooped up inside

00:43.293 --> 00:45.879
watching the seventh game
of the world series.

00:45.962 --> 00:50.175
(sarcastically) Yeah. They won't
learn anything about apples today.

00:50.258 --> 00:54.095
...and the cider mill operated
continuously until 1941

00:54.179 --> 00:57.015
when its workers left to
fight in the second world war.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.349
When they returned,

00:58.433 --> 01:00.226
the old girl was
just as they'd left her

01:00.310 --> 01:02.062
only now, she was infested

01:02.145 --> 01:04.230
with thousands
upon thousands of rats.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.941
(disgusted murmuring)

01:07.025 --> 01:08.193
Right.

01:08.276 --> 01:09.819
And if you listen
real carefully,

01:09.903 --> 01:11.613
you can still hear them
gnawing away at the apples

01:11.696 --> 01:13.698
and splashing around
in the toilets.

01:13.782 --> 01:17.118
And that concludes
this portion of the tour.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.995
(coins jingling)

01:19.079 --> 01:21.122
One of the most
historically significant

01:21.206 --> 01:24.042
fruit presses
in this part of the state.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.543
Based on a German design

01:25.627 --> 01:28.129
but modified
for larger American apples...

01:28.213 --> 01:30.590
Well, if god didn't make
little green apples

01:30.673 --> 01:31.758
it's Homer Simpson.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.301
How long
have you been here?

01:33.384 --> 01:36.096
20 of the suckiest minutes
of my life.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.264
Oh, sucking down
the cider, huh?

01:38.348 --> 01:40.975
Hey, word to the wise--
Season pass.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.852
Pays for itself
after the 16th visit.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.896
You know, most people
don't know the difference

01:44.979 --> 01:47.732
between apple cider
and apple juice, but I do.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.442
Here's a little trick
to help you remember.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.320
If it's clear and yella,
you've got juice there, fella.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.572
If it's tangy and brown,
you're in cider town.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.908
Now, there's two exceptions,
and it gets tricky here...

01:56.991 --> 01:59.869
<i>HOMER'S BRAIN: Ohh!</i>
<i>You can stay, but I'm leaving.</i>

01:59.953 --> 02:02.789
...can be yellow if they're
using late season apples.

02:02.872 --> 02:05.583
And, of course, in Canada,
the whole thing's flip-flopped.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.962
Oh my, I better get you
some cider.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.340
Next to spring and winter

02:12.423 --> 02:14.926
fall is my absolute
favorite season.

02:15.009 --> 02:18.304
Just look at all
this beautiful "foilage".

02:18.388 --> 02:21.391
It's not "foilage," Mom.
It's "foliage."

02:21.474 --> 02:22.767
Foliage.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.978
That's what I said, "foilage".

02:25.061 --> 02:26.521
It doesn't take

02:26.604 --> 02:29.732
a "nucular" scientist
to pronounce "foilage".

02:29.816 --> 02:31.442
(exasperated sigh)

02:38.908 --> 02:40.368
Honestly, Smithers

02:40.451 --> 02:42.829
I don't know why Harvard
even bothers to show up.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.248
They barely even won.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.916
Their cheating was
even more rampant

02:47.000 --> 02:48.960
than last year, sir.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.594
Well, I say let Harvard have
its football and academics.

02:57.677 --> 03:01.139
Yale will always be first
in gentlemanly club life.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.433
Why, every friend I have,
I made right here.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.226
Hello, Burnsie.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.394
It's your old roomie, Dink.

03:06.477 --> 03:07.353
(groans)

03:13.902 --> 03:16.362
Steady... Steady...

03:16.446 --> 03:17.614
(screeching)

03:19.324 --> 03:20.658
Oh-ho!
Nicely played, sir.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.368
MAN (on PA):
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

03:22.452 --> 03:24.204
<i>The train has been</i>
<i>temporarily delayed</i>

03:24.287 --> 03:26.539
<i>because of a discarded couch</i>
<i>on the tracks.</i>

03:29.500 --> 03:31.586
Looks like
some sort of a couch.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.755
This might
take a while, Smithers.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.423
Why don't you get drunk
and stumble around

03:35.506 --> 03:36.591
comically
for my amusement?

03:36.674 --> 03:38.051
I'll be a one-man conga line.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.892
Customers. Thank God.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.352
Papa needs
a new pair of everything.

03:48.686 --> 03:49.896
Hey, how you doing?

03:49.979 --> 03:51.522
Welcome to scenic Waynesport

03:51.606 --> 03:54.692
and remember your visit
with a googly-eyed walnut.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.402
How about a googly-eyed rock?

03:56.486 --> 03:58.404
Some nice local squash candy?

03:58.488 --> 03:59.948
A stretched-out Pepsi bottle?

04:00.031 --> 04:01.241
Come on.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.408
If this stuff
is too nice for you,

04:02.492 --> 04:04.077
I've got some crap.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.371
(humming drunkenly)

04:26.015 --> 04:27.392
Hey, Casey Jones,

04:27.475 --> 04:28.393
where's this train headed?

04:28.476 --> 04:29.644
Springfield.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.271
Yeah, yeah.
What state?

04:31.354 --> 04:32.272
(train whistle blows)

04:36.985 --> 04:38.486
I can honestly say

04:38.569 --> 04:40.530
that was the most fun
I've ever had.

04:40.613 --> 04:45.326
The mill, the history,
all that gorgeous... foliage.

04:45.410 --> 04:49.247
I can't "excape" Lisa,
our little walking "libary".

04:53.668 --> 04:55.503
Can't they get a pole
for that sign?

04:55.586 --> 04:56.754
That's a hitchhiker,
Homer.

04:56.838 --> 04:57.964
Ooh!
Let's pick him up.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.757
No!
What if he's crazy?

04:59.841 --> 05:02.010
And what if he's not?
Then we'd look like idiots.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.594
We're not picking him up.

05:03.678 --> 05:04.637
-Oh, yes, we are.
-There's not enough room.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.180
Yes, there is.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.974
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.476
And I think it's
the best idea I've ever had.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.895
We're picking up the weirdo,
and that's final.

05:20.361 --> 05:22.447
Hey, you folks are
all right.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.365
Man, it was rough
getting a ride out there.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.159
The only car
that stopped was a hearse

05:26.242 --> 05:27.327
that thought I fell out.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.828
It was rough, I tell you.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.498
Careful of the apple pie
on the seat.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.708
Uh-oh!

05:33.791 --> 05:36.127
Grandpa, are you sitting
on the pie?

05:36.210 --> 05:38.671
I sure hope so.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.508
I'm looking for this guy.
Anybody know who he is?

05:42.592 --> 05:44.385
Yeah, sure, we know him.
That's Mr. Burns.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.678
He tried to kill our puppies.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.347
He sexually harassed me.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.349
He stole my fiancee.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.934
He made fun of my weight.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.728
Okay, so there's been
a little friction.

05:53.811 --> 05:54.687
Know his address?

05:59.192 --> 06:02.320
Ho, this guy's got more bread
than a prison meat loaf.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.696
He's rich, I tell you.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.824
I never seen a place
with a walk-in mailbox.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.326
Hey, who am I talking to?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.330
(doorbell rings)

06:13.998 --> 06:15.208
Yes?

06:15.291 --> 06:18.211
Yeah. Uh...
Hi. My name is Larry.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.837
I'm here to see Mr. Burns.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.547
Well, I hate
to break it to you, Larry

06:21.631 --> 06:23.758
but if Mr. Burns
ever wants to see a stranger

06:23.841 --> 06:26.135
he will observe him
through a powerful telescope.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.596
-Now--
-Smithers, what's going on?

06:28.679 --> 06:30.807
How dare you interrupt
my lime rickey!

06:30.890 --> 06:33.351
(loud slurping)

06:33.434 --> 06:34.727
State your business.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.437
Well, uh... Sheesh, uh...

06:36.521 --> 06:38.106
I'm a little nervous here.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.440
What I'm trying to say
is I'm--

06:39.524 --> 06:41.359
You're what?
Selling light bulbs?

06:41.442 --> 06:42.568
Worried about the whales?

06:42.652 --> 06:44.320
Keen on Jesus?
Out with it.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.863
Well, Mr. Burns, I'm your son.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.493
Oh, and I stepped on
one of your peacocks.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.953
You got a paper towel?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.708
It's true.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.043
He is my son.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.795
Hey, now you're talking.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.422
Good God.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.258
Pop, don't get me wrong,
it's great to be here.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.384
But how does a guy
like you wind up

07:06.467 --> 07:07.885
with a son like me?

07:07.969 --> 07:10.388
Larry, my lad,
I've gone over this story

07:10.471 --> 07:12.723
in my mind a million times.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.684
It was 1941.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.478
The-- No, '39.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.230
My 25th Yale reunion.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.153
<i>Who should appear</i>
<i>but the unrequited love</i>

07:25.236 --> 07:28.865
<i>of my college years,</i>
<i>Mimsie Bancroft.</i>

07:28.948 --> 07:31.534
<i>Of course, by then, Mimsie</i>
<i>had her share of wrinkles</i>

07:31.617 --> 07:34.162
<i>and a gray hair or two</i>
<i>but my adoring eyes</i>

07:34.245 --> 07:36.164
<i>saw past those</i>
<i>minor imperfections</i>

07:36.247 --> 07:38.458
<i>to her 21-year-old</i>
<i>daughter, lily.</i>

07:38.541 --> 07:41.002
<i>I took Lily</i>
<i>to the local cinematorium</i>

07:41.085 --> 07:42.879
<i>where our passions</i>
<i>were inflamed</i>

07:42.962 --> 07:46.007
<i>by Clark Gable's reckless</i>
<i>use of the word "Damn".</i>

07:46.090 --> 07:48.968
<i>We sneaked into</i>
<i>the nearby Peabody Museum.</i>

07:49.051 --> 07:52.722
<i>There, under the smiling eyes</i>
<i>of four stuffed eskimos</i>

07:52.805 --> 07:55.349
<i>we expressed</i>
<i>our love physically</i>

07:55.433 --> 07:56.767
<i>as was the style</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

08:00.855 --> 08:03.399
How do you like that?
I have been in a museum.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.775
So, what happened
with you and ma?

08:04.859 --> 08:06.944
There was
a terrible scandal.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.446
Lily's family forced her
to give you up

08:08.529 --> 08:12.116
and bundled her off to
a convent in the south seas.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.868
I never heard
from her again.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.161
But I prattle on.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.662
Tell me everything
about your life.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.164
Oh, what's to tell?

08:18.247 --> 08:20.208
I was at the orphanage
till I was 18.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.336
Then I got my job
at a souvenir stand.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.379
Oh, and once,
I saw a blimp.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.049
Well, you must be tired.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.218
Let me
show you your room.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.055
Oh, is this posh!

08:34.138 --> 08:37.558
Pop, nobody's
ever been so nice to me.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.685
Yes, yes.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.812
All right.
(chuckles)

08:41.896 --> 08:43.940
Good to see you too.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.067
Now then,
in case you get bored,

08:46.150 --> 08:48.444
here's the playroom.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.822
You can't just eat the orange
and throw the peel away!

08:51.906 --> 08:53.616
A man's not a piece of fruit!

08:53.699 --> 08:55.660
This show was supposed
to close last week!

08:55.743 --> 08:59.288
Close this show!
Close it, I say.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.665
Hey, don't worry about it.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.707
You're all right.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.257
-(shrieks)
-Huh?

09:09.340 --> 09:10.925
Hey, you're
that hitchhiker.

09:11.008 --> 09:12.134
What are you doing here?

09:12.218 --> 09:13.719
Learning
the family business.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.638
I'm Larry Burns,
the boss' son.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.764
Uh-oh!

09:18.683 --> 09:20.518
Yeah, relax.
I don't want to work.

09:20.601 --> 09:23.479
I'm so lazy, I took
lessons on a player piano.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.273
Wow, that's really lazy.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.024
Lazy?
You're not kidding.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.193
I'm like a rug on valium.
I'm talkin' lazy.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.612
So lazy.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.282
And Larry and I have
so much in common, Marge,

09:34.365 --> 09:35.741
way more than
you and me.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.786
If I could be stranded
on an island with anyone

09:38.869 --> 09:40.746
it would definitely be Larry.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.123
I think
we've heard enough

09:42.206 --> 09:44.292
about Larry Burns
for one evening.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.210
Why? It's not like
anything interesting happened

09:46.294 --> 09:47.878
to anyone else today.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.138
Hey, Pop, this crowd
is pretty swanky.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.598
I'm not gonna fit in here.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.349
Nonsense, Larry.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.351
Your blood is bluer
than any of theirs.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.187
Just give them a snootful
of the old Burns charm.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.231
Oh, Admiral Carstairs.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.566
I'd like you to meet
my son, Larry.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.067
Hey, skipper,
good to meet you.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.236
Where'd you start out,
on the Merrimack?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.654
Hey, I should talk.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.781
I hope I look that
good when I'm 200.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.408
Such insubordination!

10:17.491 --> 10:19.160
Larry, please.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.745
He's very sensitive
about his age.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.080
Oh, Monty,
this must be the son

10:23.164 --> 10:24.665
I've heard
so much about.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.252
Larry, you must meet
our daughter, the debutante.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.087
She came out last spring.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.006
Whoa! Put her back in.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.050
She's not done yet.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.051
Hmph!

10:37.178 --> 10:40.181
Smithers, there's something
a bit odd about young Larry.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.892
I can't quite put
my finger on it.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.436
Well, he is a bit rough
around the edges, sir.

10:45.519 --> 10:48.856
One might blame his truly
heroic intake of cocktails.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.900
Pull up a seat, Pop.
You, too, Chuckles.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.109
I mean,
the food ain't great

10:52.193 --> 10:54.654
but the portions
are terrific.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.489
Hey, I'm kidding. Relax.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.574
Hey, give my regards
to Mrs. Boy-ar-dee.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.034
(groans)

11:00.117 --> 11:01.661
A total lack of refinement.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.372
Smithers, send for the boys
at Yale admissions, hmm?

11:06.791 --> 11:08.668
Well, did you meet Larry?

11:08.751 --> 11:10.002
Oh, yes.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.088
He made light
of my weight problem.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.508
Then suggested my motto
should be "Semper fudge."

11:15.591 --> 11:18.135
At that point,
he told me to "Relax."

11:18.219 --> 11:19.720
How were his test scores?

11:19.804 --> 11:21.013
Let's just say this--

11:21.097 --> 11:23.307
He spelled "Yale"
with a six.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.393
I see. Well, I--

11:25.476 --> 11:27.019
Oh, you know,
I just remembered

11:27.103 --> 11:28.771
it's time
for my annual donation.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.815
I wonder
how much I should give.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.858
Well, frankly,
test scores like Larry's

11:32.942 --> 11:35.695
would call for a
very generous contribution.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.655
For example, a score of 400

11:37.738 --> 11:40.282
would require a donation
of new football uniforms

11:40.366 --> 11:43.452
300, a new dormitory,
and in Larry's case

11:43.536 --> 11:45.121
we would need
an international airport.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.749
Yale could use an international airport,
Mr. Burns.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.042
Are you mad?

11:50.126 --> 11:51.335
I'm not made of airports!

11:51.419 --> 11:53.045
Get out!

11:53.129 --> 11:55.464
Summon my son at once.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.842
Uh...

11:57.925 --> 11:59.885
It appears
he's gone drinkin', sir.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.721
(growls)

12:01.804 --> 12:04.932
Everybody go nuts!
I'm buying!

12:05.015 --> 12:07.143
Hey, handsome,
send the bill to my dad.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.312
Okay, but the last guy
who charged a drink to Burns

12:10.396 --> 12:11.313
turned up in a landfill.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.107
Yeah, but it was worth it.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.233
(belches)

12:14.316 --> 12:15.401
What's everybody
in this burg

12:15.484 --> 12:16.777
have against my dad?

12:16.861 --> 12:18.237
He's a pussycat.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.114
I tell you,
he's a doll-baby.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.615
Come on over,
I'll show you.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.952
(loud chewing)

12:30.207 --> 12:31.417
Oh, this is some party.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.918
If it gets any livelier,

12:33.002 --> 12:34.295
a funeral's
going to break out.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.796
Quiet, you.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.006
Nobody likes a comedian.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.424
Geez. Come on, Dad.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.508
We got company.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.302
Make with the yakkety-yak-yak.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.971
(quietly):
Oh... "Yakkety-yak-yak."

12:44.054 --> 12:45.097
You, foodbag.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.265
Do you have a son?

12:47.391 --> 12:48.476
Yes, sir, I do.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.227
And is he a constant
disappointment?

12:50.311 --> 12:52.646
Does he bring home nitwits
and make you talk to them?

12:52.730 --> 12:54.148
Oh, all the time!

12:54.231 --> 12:55.900
Have you ever heard
of this kid Milhouse?

12:55.983 --> 12:57.318
He's a little wiener--

12:57.401 --> 12:58.569
Fascinating.
Good night.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.821
Dad, what's
with you tonight?

13:00.905 --> 13:02.990
I mean, I'm getting
frostbite over here.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.284
I'll tell you
what's with me.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.786
The humiliation of having

13:06.869 --> 13:10.831
a coarse, boorish
ignoramus for a son!

13:10.915 --> 13:15.461
(quietly):
Uh, I should go.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.921
What's the matter, Pop?

13:17.004 --> 13:18.339
Don't you love me anymore?

13:18.422 --> 13:19.590
(door slams)

13:25.429 --> 13:27.765
Sheesh, Dad and I,
we started out great

13:27.848 --> 13:30.518
but now it's falling apart
like a Chinese motorcycle.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.852
It's so unfair.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.562
You're everything
a dad could hope for.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.856
Yeah, I tell you,
I don't get no regard.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.066
No regard at all.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.567
No esteem, either.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.611
Larry, there's
only one sure way

13:40.694 --> 13:42.488
to make him realize
how much he loves you.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.073
And that...

13:44.156 --> 13:46.158
is a phony kidnapping.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.952
Yeah, right.
I don't know.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.204
Maybe I should
just leave town.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.414
(sing-song)
Phony kidnapping.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.582
Nah.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.626
I know what I got to do.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.086
I got to clean up my act.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.838
No more joking around
all the time.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.464
No more slacking off at work.

14:00.548 --> 14:04.593
And most important:
no more booze.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.928
I know I can do it.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.808
"Your son has been kidnapped."

14:16.021 --> 14:19.358
I can't believe someone
would kidnap my Larry.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.360
I won't rest until
he's returned to me.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.904
Not to be impertinent, sir,
but didn't you want Larry

14:23.988 --> 14:26.365
out of your life as recently
as two hours ago?

14:26.448 --> 14:27.825
It's the principle, Smithers.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.827
Nobody steals
from Montgomery Burns

14:29.910 --> 14:31.829
whether it be
my Sunday newspaper

14:31.912 --> 14:33.163
or my loutish oaf
of a son.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.540
All right, Mr. B.,

14:34.623 --> 14:36.959
when the kidnappers call
with the ransom demand

14:37.042 --> 14:38.836
you tell them
you'll leave the money

14:38.919 --> 14:40.713
under the big net in the park.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.841
And then down comes
the net, right, chief?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.926
Hey, I like it.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.012
I like it a lot.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.642
Hmm?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.693
What are you doing
in the basement?

15:02.776 --> 15:04.612
It's like you're hiding out
down here.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.363
Hiding out?

15:06.447 --> 15:08.991
Marge, you've been reading
too many hideout books.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.118
What's that hitchhiker
doing here?

15:11.201 --> 15:13.412
Is every drifter we meet
going to move in with us?

15:13.495 --> 15:14.955
Of course not.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.999
We'll decide that on
a drifter-by-drifter basis.

15:17.082 --> 15:20.044
He's not a drifter, Mom.
That's Mr. Burns's son, Larry.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.004
He's great at pointing out
everyone's foibles.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.088
Hey! How are you doing?

15:23.172 --> 15:24.715
Hoo, look at your hair.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.759
What happened?
You saw yourself in the mirror?

15:26.842 --> 15:28.260
He's kidding, Mom.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.387
But seriously, I'd love
to have hair like yours.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.014
I just can't get
the zoning permits.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.142
Hey, that reminds me, Mom--
Buckingham palace called.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.602
They want their hat back.

15:36.685 --> 15:37.853
(grumbles)

15:37.937 --> 15:39.813
Hey, kids, how about
a hand for your mom?

15:39.897 --> 15:40.981
She's all right.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.858
-Yeah, Mom!
-All right, Mom!

15:42.942 --> 15:44.652
Oh. Yeah. Thank you.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.115
(phone ringing)

15:50.199 --> 15:51.450
Ahoy-hoy?

15:51.533 --> 15:53.035
(voice buzzing)
Hello, Mr. Burns.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.120
This is the kidnapper.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.830
Do you miss your son?

15:56.914 --> 15:58.248
Yes, I'm missing
one son.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.583
Return it immediately.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.044
If you really
love Larry, prove it,

16:02.127 --> 16:04.421
and you can
have him back today.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.924
Oh, how much proof
do you need?

16:07.007 --> 16:08.258
5,000? 6,000?

16:08.342 --> 16:10.010
I swear,
that's all I've got.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.429
Don't you care
about your son?

16:12.513 --> 16:14.431
This is more important
than money.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.432
More important
than money?

16:15.516 --> 16:16.934
Who is this?

16:17.017 --> 16:20.270
Uh... just a second.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.024
Beautiful. Eddie, did you
trace the phone number?

16:24.108 --> 16:25.359
Sure did, chief.

16:25.442 --> 16:29.405
555... Aw, geez,
that's got to be phony.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.536
Hey, I think I got a pai gow.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.454
I hate pai gow.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.706
Can't we just play quang jong?

16:38.789 --> 16:39.832
Can't we just
go upstairs?

16:39.915 --> 16:41.417
Homer: No!

16:41.500 --> 16:43.460
<i>This is Kent Brockman</i>
<i>in Choppercopter 6</i>

16:43.544 --> 16:45.212
<i>with a special report.</i>

16:45.295 --> 16:48.382
<i>Montgomery Burns's son</i>
<i>has been kidnapped.</i>

16:48.465 --> 16:49.758
Kidnapped?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.052
Marge, it's not
a real kidnapping.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.972
It's a simple hoax
to win a father's love.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.849
You know how I feel
about hoaxes.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.017
Still?

16:58.100 --> 16:59.143
I want you to take
Larry back

16:59.226 --> 17:00.477
to Mr. Burns right now

17:00.561 --> 17:02.187
before you get in
a lot of trouble.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.564
What!?

17:03.647 --> 17:05.357
But, Marge, it's
broad daylight

17:05.441 --> 17:06.900
and there's
cops everywhere.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.485
No excuses.
Just do it.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.154
Oh!

17:14.783 --> 17:15.909
<i>Of course</i>
<i>we'll bring you updates</i>

17:15.993 --> 17:17.369
<i>just as soon as they--</i>

17:17.453 --> 17:18.871
<i>Oh, wait a minute!</i>
<i>There they are!</i>

17:18.954 --> 17:21.290
<i>Larry Burns and his kidnapper.</i>

17:21.373 --> 17:22.458
<i>(screams)</i>

17:25.878 --> 17:28.130
<i>Appearing in broad daylight</i>
<i>with police everywhere--</i>

17:28.213 --> 17:30.966
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, there's</i>
<i>only one word for that:</i>

17:31.050 --> 17:32.051
<i>Idiocy.</i>

17:32.134 --> 17:34.178
(groans)

17:34.261 --> 17:37.431
(sirens wailing)

17:41.310 --> 17:42.686
(panting)

17:42.770 --> 17:44.813
We've got to find
someplace to hide.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.106
The abandoned warehouse.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.861
D'oh!

17:50.944 --> 17:52.279
Stupid economic recovery.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.875
Hey, buy a costume
or get out, fellas.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.090
We've got to find someplace
no one will ever go.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.216
Hello!

18:15.469 --> 18:16.637
CHILD:
<i>Drive faster, Grandma!</i>

18:16.720 --> 18:19.056
<i>Grandma's gaining on us!</i>

18:19.139 --> 18:21.558
(chuckles) They'll never look
for us here.

18:21.642 --> 18:24.353
This place is emptier
than a Scottish pay toilet.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.646
Shh!

18:25.729 --> 18:29.316
Some people are trying
to watch the movie.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.151
You don't like it,
call the cops.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.862
(laughing)

18:33.946 --> 18:37.491
(both laughing)

18:40.285 --> 18:42.037
(sirens wailing)

18:42.121 --> 18:44.581
This is Kent Brockman,
live from the Aztec theater

18:44.665 --> 18:46.250
where police have learned

18:46.333 --> 18:47.584
that kidnapper Homer Simpson
and hostage Larry Burns

18:47.668 --> 18:50.546
<i>are inside talking loudly.</i>

18:50.629 --> 18:52.673
Oh, give yourself up, Homie!

18:52.756 --> 18:54.341
No, Dad!
Shoot your way out!

18:55.884 --> 18:57.845
(gunfire)

18:57.928 --> 19:00.222
(screaming)

19:00.305 --> 19:02.891
<i>A bloody end</i>
<i>for Homer Simpson...</i>

19:02.975 --> 19:04.685

19:08.814 --> 19:10.983
<i>with a barrage of baseballs.</i>

19:11.066 --> 19:13.110
We've got to go

<i>Eeech! Ouch! Oooch!</i>

Shh.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.584
(crunching)
Still warm.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.710
-They can't be far.

WIGGUM:
Don't be a fool, Simpson.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.182
Let the kid go.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.559
The negotiations have failed.
Shoot him!

19:45.642 --> 19:46.768
(hammer cocking)

19:48.228 --> 19:49.146
Wait!

19:49.229 --> 19:50.314
(all gasping)

19:50.397 --> 19:51.607
WOMAN: Wait? What do
you mean, wait?

19:51.690 --> 19:52.983
I mean,
Homer's no kidnapper.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.277
He's the best friend
I ever had.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.486
We faked the whole thing.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.072
(shocked murmuring)

19:59.156 --> 20:00.616
I should have known
you're the only one

20:00.699 --> 20:01.950
stupid enough
to kidnap you.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.994
Now get down here
so I can spank you

20:04.077 --> 20:05.162
in front of this
gawking rabble.

20:05.245 --> 20:07.623
Smithers, take off
my belt.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.790
With pleasure, sir.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.542
Hold on, Mr. Burns.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.711
Maybe we did fake
a kidnapping

20:12.794 --> 20:15.422
but is that really
such a crime?

20:15.505 --> 20:17.633
All your son wanted
was a little attention,

20:17.716 --> 20:19.426
a little love.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.470
I'm a father myself, sir.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.180
And sure,
sometimes my kids

20:23.263 --> 20:27.184
can be obnoxious...
or boring... or stinky

20:27.267 --> 20:29.728
but they can always count
on one thing:

20:29.811 --> 20:32.439
their father's
unconditional love.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.195
Well, how about it, Pop?

20:38.278 --> 20:39.738
I know it's tough

20:39.821 --> 20:41.782
but can you love me
for what I am?

20:41.865 --> 20:42.991
Uh...

20:44.409 --> 20:45.285
Well...

20:46.620 --> 20:47.871
Uh...

20:47.955 --> 20:50.832
There, there, sonny boy.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.710
I suppose I have been
a bit--

20:53.794 --> 20:55.212
Oh, no, I can't do it.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.713
It's just not me.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.091
I'm sorry, Larry

20:59.174 --> 21:01.635
I can't be the family
that you need.

21:01.718 --> 21:04.763
Aw, that's okay.
I got a wife and kids.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.306
Oh, that reminds me.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.933
They're probably wondering
where I went.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.476
I told them I'm going
for coffee.

21:09.559 --> 21:10.727
That was a week ago.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.605
Well, Son, delighted
to have met you.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.065
It's good to know

21:15.148 --> 21:17.818
that there's another
kidney out there for me.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.444
You got it, Pop.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.863
Just let me run a few
pints through it first.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.907
As long as everybody's here...

21:23.991 --> 21:25.492
Let's party!

21:25.575 --> 21:27.995

21:38.505 --> 21:40.757

coming from?

21:40.841 --> 21:42.134
It's a party, Marge.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.344
It doesn't have
to make sense.
