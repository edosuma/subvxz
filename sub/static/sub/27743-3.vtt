that Carmen Sandiego

What more motive would she need?

05:31.080 --> 05:34.083
Do you find it curious
that he had no identification,

05:34.375 --> 05:35.918
not even a train ticket?

05:36.127 --> 05:38.963
The Scarlet Outlaw clearly stole
the poor man's wallet.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.257
That would certainly be
a valid assumption.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.967
Of course it would.
Thank you.

-As in, casing a joint?

07:35.663 --> 07:37.790

we first met Carmen.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.125
Right!

07:39.208 --> 07:41.085
She was casing the same joint.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.421
Who'd ever guess a South Boston donut shop

Or "donuts."

Red Drone's a she?

10:04.770 --> 10:06.439

10:06.981 --> 10:09.984
Well, more rice bowls for me.

10:10.526 --> 10:13.112
-[munches]
-Zack, these aren't rice bowls.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.948
They're petri dishes filled with rice,

10:16.324 --> 10:18.284
covered in some sort of...
[sniffs]

10:18.576 --> 10:19.785
fungus.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.204
-Dude, like mushrooms?
-[Player] <i>Like spores.</i>

10:22.413 --> 10:24.248
Superspores, to be exact.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.959
Genetically engineered to feed on rice.

10:27.209 --> 10:30.630
I pulled the data from a folder labeled
"Operation Sticky Rice."

10:30.755 --> 10:34.091
-What do you mean "feed on rice"?
<i>-Just how it sounds, Red.</i>

10:34.467 --> 10:37.261
<i>These superspores take to grain</i>
<i>like termites to wood.</i>

10:37.345 --> 10:38.971
<i>According to Bellum's research,</i>

10:39.055 --> 10:42.725
<i>these organisms can wipe out entire crops</i>
<i>in a matter of hours.</i>

10:42.808 --> 10:44.143
A bioweapon.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.063
And if VILE cleared out
because they knew we were coming,

10:47.146 --> 10:50.232
they no doubt took their entire stockpile
of spores with them.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.610
Player, can you pinpoint
any likely targets?

10:52.902 --> 10:54.862
<i>You're surrounded by likely targets.</i>

10:54.945 --> 10:58.616
Indonesia produces 70 million tons
of rice per year, remember?

10:58.783 --> 11:01.243
[Ivy] So, VILE wipes out some rice fields.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.579
Order pizza, problem solved, right?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.373
Rice is Indonesia's staple food.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.668
If crops are destroyed,
its entire population could go hungry.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.795
Way hungrier than I'm feeling now.

11:10.878 --> 11:14.757
So, what can we do about it?
We're not the grain police, we're thieves.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.469
We can see to it Bellum never gets
a chance to use her superspores

11:18.552 --> 11:19.887
by stealing them.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.931
I like it.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.642
But how are we supposed to find
teeny, tiny spores

11:24.725 --> 11:26.644
in a great, big rainforest?

11:26.727 --> 11:28.729
[Zack] Hey, check it out!

11:29.146 --> 11:30.272
Truck tracks.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.652
And we know they just left.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.162
One thing still doesn't click.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.747
What's in it for VILE?

11:46.956 --> 11:48.666
Why would they go through all the trouble

11:48.749 --> 11:51.669
of engineering
some crazy food shortage crisis?

11:51.752 --> 11:55.714
To force a hungry population to buy
VILE brand instant imitation rice,

11:55.798 --> 11:57.758
at inflated prices, no doubt.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.846
<i>They tried to feed it to us</i>

12:01.929 --> 12:05.099

12:05.182 --> 12:06.684
[sobbing]

12:07.977 --> 12:11.230
If Dr. Bellum thinks I'll stand by
while she risks people starving

12:11.313 --> 12:14.108
so VILE can make a quick buck...
[laughs]

12:14.191 --> 12:15.776
she has a surprise coming.

12:15.860 --> 12:16.694
[Zack] Carm!

12:23.242 --> 12:24.869
Hmm, I'll take the shortcut.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.801
Something tells me
that was no Komodo dragon.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.554
Hiyasss!

12:45.723 --> 12:48.767
-Tigress. Haven't seen you since...
-Morocco.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.729
The pit.
You broke my glasses.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.147
You didn't protect the face.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.817
You may want to protect yours
before I rearrange it!

12:57.359 --> 12:58.194
Ya!

12:58.611 --> 12:59.778
[screeches]

13:00.279 --> 13:01.947
[grunting]

13:13.292 --> 13:15.211

Yes, I would.

[Player] <i>If Dr. Bellum's bioweapon</i>

15:57.331 --> 16:01.168
[Carmen] Bellum's superspores must be
packed into the pods of the skyrockets.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.879
Player, where would someone go
to see fireworks around here?

16:04.004 --> 16:06.048
[Player] Hmm.
It's not New Year's Eve.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.968
And Indonesians don't celebrate
the 4th of July.

16:09.301 --> 16:13.055
But there is a Shadow Puppet Festival
tonight not too far from you,

16:13.389 --> 16:14.848
just outside of Jakarta.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.560
Let me guess, bordering a swath
of interconnected rice paddies?

[Player] <i>You're suave and you're psychic.</i>

16:20.980 --> 16:22.815
So, why is VILE sneaking around?

16:23.065 --> 16:26.485
Why not have Tigress find the nearest
rice crop and scatter the spores?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.195
Not VILE's style.

16:28.612 --> 16:32.616
They never operate without a smokescreen,
and they never show their true face.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.829
[Argent] No face, no name,
no fingerprints.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.456
It's as if our witness didn't exist.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.834
Are you trying to rub it in, Ms. Argent?

16:42.126 --> 16:44.628
Because you are doing
a sensational job of it.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.964
We know that he indeed exists

16:47.047 --> 16:50.175
because some faceless, nameless
paper-pusher here at Interpol, Paris,

16:50.259 --> 16:51.760
approved his release.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.431
Then perhaps you were right, Inspector.
The man must have been innocent.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.766
Of course I was right!

16:59.059 --> 17:03.814
Which means the only link I have
to Carmen Sandiego is long gone.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.233
It all seems very strange,

17:06.316 --> 17:08.902

just out of view,
