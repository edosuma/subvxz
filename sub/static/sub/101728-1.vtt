WEBVTT

01:00.560 --> 01:03.829
Hey, how was the beach?

01:04.228 --> 01:06.531
- You talking to me?
- Huh?

01:06.564 --> 01:07.533
Yeah.

01:07.566 --> 01:09.034
Oh, shit, I thought you were on
the phone.

01:09.067 --> 01:10.335
What, what did you say?

01:10.368 --> 01:13.338
I was just asking if you had
fun at the beach.

01:13.371 --> 01:21.346
Oh! Yeah, um, it was fun. A
whole water polo team was there,

01:21.614 --> 01:23.049
Everyone got fucked up.

01:23.081 --> 01:25.117
Captains got fucked up.

01:25.218 --> 01:28.254
I, uh... sun fucked
me in the ass.

01:28.287 --> 01:31.790
Just like, shoulder's are
burned to shit.

01:31.823 --> 01:34.727
But, yeah.
It was lit.

01:43.569 --> 01:47.106
There was this, uhh.
There was this girl at the beach.

01:47.138 --> 01:48.740
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:48.774 --> 01:53.846
She had these massive fuckin'
colossal...

01:53.945 --> 01:54.881
hands.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.987
- Get it?
- Yeah, it's funny.

02:02.087 --> 02:04.823
Yeah, 'cause-my hands are like,
near my chest.

02:04.924 --> 02:06.492
Yeah, I know, I thought you were
gonna say "boobs".

02:06.525 --> 02:07.893
Right?

02:08.127 --> 02:09.161
You think that's funny,
though, right?

02:09.260 --> 02:12.298
Like, like you
could see that on stage?

02:12.331 --> 02:14.900
Like, people laughing in the
audience and stuff?

02:17.068 --> 02:17.903
Yeah.

02:19.138 --> 02:20.139
Yeah. I know, I think it
could get some laughs.

02:20.171 --> 02:21.540
Yeah. Sweet. Good.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.977
I was, I was just thinking about,
like, doing, like stand-up comedy.

02:25.010 --> 02:26.846
You know?

02:26.945 --> 02:27.913
I mean, we're in L.A., so...

02:28.548 --> 02:30.348
- Definitely.
- Yeah, I mean...

02:30.449 --> 02:33.586
I aint fuckin' water
polo after college.

02:33.686 --> 02:34.319
Right?

02:34.353 --> 02:36.389
Yeah, that's also true.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.189
Yup.

02:41.193 --> 02:43.229
Do you know if there are any
parties tonight?

02:43.329 --> 02:47.165
Ugh... there, umm...

02:47.199 --> 02:49.736
Yeah, yeah. Shithouse
is having a party.

02:52.004 --> 02:53.939
- Like, the house is called "Shithouse"?
- Mmmhmm.

02:55.974 --> 02:58.943
Are any other, are any other houses having a party?

02:58.978 --> 03:01.080
- Is there what?
- Are any other houses having anything?

03:01.180 --> 03:03.748
No, no man. It's just-no,
it's just Shithouse.

03:03.981 --> 03:07.552
Uhh, it's kinda far, but my
buddy Seb said it's gonna be...

03:07.586 --> 03:08.955
fire. So...

03:12.123 --> 03:12.959
- Fire.
- Huh?

03:13.558 --> 03:14.294
Hmm?

03:15.526 --> 03:16.628
What did you, what did you...
Did you say something?

03:23.235 --> 03:24.604
Oh, my God.

03:25.236 --> 03:26.972
Why is it so cold?

03:34.712 --> 03:35.281
Fuck!

03:40.719 --> 03:41.454
Sam?

04:01.806 --> 04:03.241
Hi, you're in RA, right?

04:03.275 --> 04:05.243
- You get locked out?
- Yeah, sorry.

04:05.276 --> 04:06.010
No worries.
Where's your room?

04:06.245 --> 04:06.980
This way.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.216
Did you just do laundry?

04:10.248 --> 04:12.016
Yeah, you just take a shower?

04:12.251 --> 04:14.020
- Yeah, it's this one.
- Okay.

04:15.287 --> 04:16.389
Thank you so much.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.624
I'm really sorry.

04:23.295 --> 04:25.331
When I check
my bunk, I realize...

04:43.315 --> 04:44.616
Yeah, Mom.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.251
That was mean.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.684
You love leaves.

05:29.927 --> 05:32.098
Oh, no no no. I didn't mean to
make you... don't worry.

05:32.298 --> 05:33.531
Don't worry, she's fine.

05:33.632 --> 05:36.334
It's just a particularly rough
week.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.137
Still, I can't believe we
didn't get

05:38.170 --> 05:41.407
to hug you on your fucking
birthday.

05:41.673 --> 05:44.242
I know.

05:44.276 --> 05:47.079
<i>She's so sweet.</i>

05:47.178 --> 05:50.849
I think she's just missing her
buddy.

06:04.528 --> 06:06.497
Okay, I think is going to be
Scotland's guy

06:06.531 --> 06:08.233
for me. I'm going to do this.

06:08.334 --> 06:10.203
Hello everyone in my room,

06:10.235 --> 06:11.336
who is ready to leave?

06:11.370 --> 06:15.173
Jack, drink. Drink it.

06:15.206 --> 06:15.942
Dude, I just went.

06:19.644 --> 06:22.781
You all are getting ready for
the party here?

06:22.882 --> 06:23.949
What the fuck you say?

06:24.182 --> 06:27.452
I just asked if you all are
getting ready for the party.

06:27.552 --> 06:29.187
Looks like you're all getting
ready.

06:29.221 --> 06:30.221
Yeah.

06:30.454 --> 06:31.524
I'm just calling the
Uber, are you coming?

06:31.557 --> 06:33.192
I'm not sure yet.

06:33.225 --> 06:35.161
I'm not sure yet.

06:41.432 --> 06:43.135
Have you been at Shit House
before?

06:43.235 --> 06:45.837
Yeah, like 90 times.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.175
Oh, my gosh.

06:53.411 --> 06:54.613
Oh, shit.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.184
Yes, dude. Yes.

06:59.451 --> 07:03.855
Oh! I love college so much!

07:08.293 --> 07:09.461
Yeah, it's great.

07:09.495 --> 07:12.298
Yeah dude, it's fucking hella
pussy bro.

07:12.398 --> 07:18.671
Hella vagina, bro, in my fucking
face, bro.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.439
My. Fuck.

07:20.473 --> 07:21.706
Oh my God dude.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.213
Are you okay?

07:27.413 --> 07:29.448
Yeah bro. Shit, dude, fuck.

07:29.482 --> 07:36.055
I should not drink
anymore fuck, oh fuck.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.292
But that's that life man,

07:39.324 --> 07:40.225
he said what the fuck.

07:42.827 --> 07:45.296
Are you going to
throw up right now?

07:45.331 --> 07:47.699
No, it's okay. It's okay,

07:47.800 --> 07:49.235
I'm good. I'm good.
Thanks, man.

07:57.776 --> 08:00.045
I'm gonna close the door for
you buddy.

08:06.485 --> 08:07.252
Having fun in Shithouse?

08:07.720 --> 08:09.688
What? No, it's really shitty
here.

08:09.788 --> 08:11.223
I don't know what you're
talking about dude.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.401
Did you steal that bottle of
wine from the party?

08:22.500 --> 08:25.303
Oh, no, I brought this from
home.

08:25.336 --> 08:30.108
I like having something heavy in
my hands to hold at a party.

08:30.208 --> 08:31.443
Yeah, I get that.

08:31.543 --> 08:33.478
I feel like, that it's just
like too dinky when

08:33.511 --> 08:36.514
you hold it. You know what I
mean?

08:36.548 --> 08:38.350
Yeah, it's too dinky.

08:43.721 --> 08:46.725
Hey, I like your shirt.
I like your shirt.

08:46.825 --> 08:49.860
Which one? I'm wearing two.

08:49.894 --> 08:52.331
Oh, I have to see the one
underneath.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.932
So I should just
take this one off?

08:54.066 --> 08:55.300
I don't know,

08:55.500 --> 08:57.068
if you feel comfortable,
why now, yeah.

08:57.102 --> 08:57.802
I feel comfortable.

08:57.903 --> 09:01.506
Okay.

09:01.539 --> 09:03.541
Scott from STAT wants to fuck
you too.

09:03.575 --> 09:05.244
Sofia just talked to him, okay?

09:05.344 --> 09:09.348
So operation fuck Scott is in
full swing, all right?

09:09.380 --> 09:13.519
You're going to go get that
dick. It's operation covert.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.601
Hi.

10:03.634 --> 10:05.203
You want to play a game?

10:05.303 --> 10:07.807
Alex, what's yours?

10:08.807 --> 10:09.341
Huh?

10:09.441 --> 10:11.143
What's up?

10:11.243 --> 10:15.581
- I said you want to play a game.
- Oh, a game!

10:15.614 --> 10:17.516
Yeah, what's the game?

10:17.615 --> 10:19.317
It's called, spin the bottle.

10:19.418 --> 10:23.121
Have you heard of it?

10:23.154 --> 10:23.655
Yeah.

10:23.755 --> 10:25.156
Okay, I'll go first.

10:25.256 --> 10:32.397
Oh right here? Okay. How's it
going to go.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.065
Look at that.

10:45.043 --> 10:46.010
Ouch.

10:46.043 --> 10:48.980
- You're trouble, aren't you?
- Trouble?

10:49.014 --> 10:50.548
Wait, sorry. What's your name?

10:50.649 --> 10:51.883
Georgia.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.619
Okay, Georgia. I'm going to
move really quickly.

10:53.652 --> 10:55.621
Georgia, I'm from Texas.

10:55.653 --> 10:58.224
You're not from Georgia?

10:58.323 --> 10:59.790
Yeah. No, I was in.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.995
I'm not from Texas.

11:03.028 --> 11:03.695
That's okay.

11:03.794 --> 11:05.430
Let's get in the bed.

11:05.630 --> 11:06.932
Okay. Yeah. I'm just really
quickly,

11:06.966 --> 11:10.034
I was going to go check on my
backpack outside.

11:10.134 --> 11:13.739
You brought a backpack to
the party?

11:13.839 --> 11:18.677
Yeah. No, maybe I didn't,

11:18.710 --> 11:20.211
but I just want to go check to
make sure

11:20.245 --> 11:22.782
that I didn't bring it.

11:23.615 --> 11:24.884
Oh and he misses.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.918
Whoo!

11:28.788 --> 11:30.456
And he makes.

11:34.559 --> 11:37.462
And he makes.

11:39.565 --> 11:42.600
I am the basket.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.769
Hey, Sweetie.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.672
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

11:46.705 --> 11:52.377
No, I'm up. just had a party.
You okay?

11:52.410 --> 11:54.311
Yeah. I'm, yeah.

11:54.346 --> 11:57.482
I'm just having a little
trouble falling asleep,

11:57.716 --> 11:59.751
because I think I have like a
cold.

11:59.851 --> 12:01.720
Shit, I'm so sorry.

12:01.753 --> 12:03.121
Yeah, thanks. It's okay.

12:03.221 --> 12:05.322
Are you taking something? You
should be taking stuff.

12:05.356 --> 12:09.927
Well, I was going to go to the
CVS by campus,

12:10.028 --> 12:12.297
the 24-hour one, and I was
going to

12:12.397 --> 12:14.866
get some Claritin, but-

12:14.899 --> 12:16.567
No, sweetie, not Claritin.

12:16.601 --> 12:18.135
I always say don't take
Claritin

12:18.235 --> 12:19.605
because it doesn't do anything
for you.

12:19.705 --> 12:21.105
You need to take Allegra.

12:21.139 --> 12:22.606
Oh, right. Yes.

12:22.706 --> 12:24.509
You need Allegra for the
decongestant,

12:24.710 --> 12:26.478
but actually you should take
Benadril at night.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.423
Do that for like three days and
that should clear up.

12:39.524 --> 12:46.465
Okay. Perfect. Okay. Awesome.
Oh, I'm going to go walk over to the CVS.

12:46.498 --> 12:48.934
Honey, why don't you see if
Josh could give you a ride,

12:48.966 --> 12:52.002
you probably shouldn't be
walking around. You should rest.

12:52.102 --> 12:54.973
Yeah. Maybe I'll check with him.

12:55.006 --> 12:55.540
Okay.

13:00.812 --> 13:02.181
You okay?

13:02.280 --> 13:05.583
Yeah. I'm just not feeling
well and it's super frustrating.

13:05.616 --> 13:10.221
But I'm going to go ask Josh if
he can take me to the CVS.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.857
So I got to go.

13:13.725 --> 13:15.561
<i>Okay, bye sweet boy.</i>

13:19.663 --> 13:22.902
Okay. Goodnight, I love you.

13:22.934 --> 13:23.934
<i>I love you.</i>

13:23.969 --> 13:25.171
I love you too. Okay, bye.

13:44.123 --> 13:47.026
Oh, no. No wait.
No wait. No wait.

13:59.871 --> 14:05.209
Can you leave and don't tell
anybody about this.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.012
Okay.

14:07.046 --> 14:10.649
And I'm going to
be going through a rough patch.

14:18.690 --> 14:25.931
Little third grade Brade Duper,
walks over to little third grade-

14:26.298 --> 14:30.469
There we are. Knock knock,
Who's there?

14:30.568 --> 14:32.703
It's me and fucking drunk.

14:32.738 --> 14:33.405
Are you okay?

14:33.438 --> 14:34.639
No.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.475
Sam, you okay?

14:37.576 --> 14:39.043
No, I'm fine. I'm fine,

14:39.076 --> 14:41.713
I'm not going to throw up. I'm
not going to fucking.

14:41.746 --> 14:42.613
You're going to throw-.

14:42.714 --> 14:43.748
No, I'm not going to throw up,

14:43.847 --> 14:45.450
shut the fuck up.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.185
Shut, the fuck, up.

14:47.217 --> 14:48.886
You suck, you suck, you suck.

14:48.919 --> 14:51.955
Get it? Got it? Get it?

14:52.056 --> 14:54.559
Jerry Seinfeld thinks you suck.

14:54.591 --> 14:55.860
I think you suck.

14:55.894 --> 14:58.697
What's the deal with shitty
roommates?

14:58.730 --> 15:00.231
It's never a good one, there's
never,

15:00.264 --> 15:03.600
there's never a good one.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

15:03.701 --> 15:05.870
Oh, but I don't want a roommate.

15:05.903 --> 15:06.737
But I don't want a-

15:09.942 --> 15:10.975
I fucking hate you.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.577
Do you want me
to get you some water?

15:12.610 --> 15:15.913
No. Yeah. I got water.

15:15.947 --> 15:18.750
That's a huge bottle of vodka.

15:18.783 --> 15:19.985
No, it's fucking water.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.488
You're about to drink vodka
right now.

15:24.755 --> 15:25.323
Just.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.734
Get hugs from Mom and Jess.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.479
Why is God so hard?

16:22.379 --> 16:29.721
I feel like I'm just, like...
Floating and nobody like.

16:32.490 --> 16:34.058
What?

16:51.243 --> 16:52.778
Sam?

16:55.413 --> 16:57.783
Fuck.

16:57.982 --> 17:01.819
- Sam, Sam, you're shitting yourself.
- Hmm?

17:01.854 --> 17:05.457
Sam, I think you might still be shitting.
Are you pooping right now.

17:05.557 --> 17:06.924
No. No, I didn't.

17:07.026 --> 17:11.562
Yeah, you 100 percent did.
Let's get you up. Okay?

17:11.596 --> 17:12.830
Oh, shit.

17:12.931 --> 17:15.366
We're going to go to the shower,
okay? And get your pants off.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.636
No, these are my good pants.

17:17.736 --> 17:18.871
These are your what?

17:18.903 --> 17:20.204
These are my good pants.

17:20.305 --> 17:24.676
I know they are your good pants
but you pooped in them.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.846
We need to at least get up and
go in the shower.

17:27.878 --> 17:31.416
No, I didn't do nothing.

17:32.049 --> 17:33.951
Sam, we need to get up.

17:34.051 --> 17:35.252
I didn't do nothing.

17:35.353 --> 17:36.954
You dropped a
deuce in our room, man.

17:37.055 --> 17:37.822
I didn't shit.

17:38.022 --> 17:40.458
Okay. Ow. Don't-

17:48.865 --> 17:50.234
Am I not allowed to sleep here?

17:50.268 --> 17:52.836
Right now you can. Did you get
kicked out of your room?

17:53.038 --> 17:56.240
Yeah. Yeah. Did you?

17:56.273 --> 17:58.209
Oh, no. R. E.'s get singles?

17:58.242 --> 17:59.644
Just I didn't have anything
else to eat,

17:59.844 --> 18:02.413
so I had an energy bar earlier
so I just can't sleep.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.652
What was on your shirt?

18:08.752 --> 18:13.157
Oh, I actually have it on still.

18:14.726 --> 18:21.700
It just says, It says "The time
is now" on it. Nothing special.

18:21.799 --> 18:23.534
Cool.

18:24.635 --> 18:27.271
How is your operation?

18:27.305 --> 18:30.509
Operation fucks got from stat.

18:30.608 --> 18:35.846
Oh, God. It was like a fails
operation. Nothing happens.

18:35.946 --> 18:40.617
- No?
- Nothing special.

18:40.719 --> 18:42.586
You really going to have to go to
sleep and I really keeping you up?

18:42.619 --> 18:46.324
Oh, no. I wasn't sleeping. I'm
not tired.

18:46.357 --> 18:46.959
Okay.

18:46.991 --> 18:48.259
I'm not tired at all.

18:48.292 --> 18:50.928
Do you want to,
like go hang out?

18:51.296 --> 18:55.100
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.

18:55.133 --> 18:58.669
Yeah. What do you want to do?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.171
Like where

19:00.271 --> 19:03.207
I was thinking we could go to
the Grand Canyon.

19:03.307 --> 19:08.814
The Grand Canyon?
Do you have a car?

19:08.846 --> 19:10.748
What? I'm talking about

19:10.781 --> 19:14.351
going in my room and hanging
out there instead of here.

19:14.385 --> 19:15.586
Oh.

19:19.458 --> 19:20.859
Like to kiss and have sex?

19:20.959 --> 19:23.362
Oh.

19:24.095 --> 19:26.163
Is that what you're asking?

19:26.196 --> 19:28.933
I guess so.

19:29.134 --> 19:32.371
Do you even know my name?

19:34.105 --> 19:36.842
What's your name?

19:37.107 --> 19:39.411
I'm not going to just tell you.

19:39.510 --> 19:42.614
Why? I'll tell you my name.

19:42.713 --> 19:44.348
I know your name.

19:44.382 --> 19:45.583
It's Maggie Hill.

19:45.682 --> 19:47.919
You've been my RA for like six
months now.

19:48.019 --> 19:49.855
Why are you making me feel bad?

19:49.887 --> 19:51.188
Because you should feel bad.

19:51.222 --> 19:53.758
Okay. Well, I do feel bad.

19:53.857 --> 19:55.460
What's your name?

19:55.560 --> 19:56.461
Get out of here.

19:56.493 --> 19:59.964
Get out of here?
That's a weird name.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.368
It's Alex.

20:04.403 --> 20:07.939
Okay, Alex.

20:08.038 --> 20:11.009
I'm sorry that I didn't know or
ask.

20:11.042 --> 20:12.543
Why? Don't be sorry.

20:12.576 --> 20:14.546
I'm not.

20:14.578 --> 20:18.317
I do want you to come to my
room, though.

20:29.527 --> 20:32.264
You can put your stuff down if
you want.

20:32.364 --> 20:39.270
Yeah. Just put it down right
here?

20:45.544 --> 20:48.714
I just ruined your room by
doing that.

20:48.747 --> 20:55.987
Is it always this clean or is
this just a Friday thing?

20:56.221 --> 20:57.455
It's always this clean.

20:58.756 --> 21:05.830
I don't think I've made my bed
in like ever, probably.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.267
I recommend it.

21:12.703 --> 21:14.839
Can I have some of this wine
that's here?

21:15.073 --> 21:17.342
Oh, yeah, I know. You can just have
all of it. I have, like a ton of it.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.942
Well, there's a ton in here,

21:18.976 --> 21:20.045
but I will have all of it, but.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.247
Just have as much as you want.

21:22.279 --> 21:23.382
Cheers.

21:30.788 --> 21:32.456
It's good.

21:34.791 --> 21:36.260
Are you 21?

21:36.294 --> 21:37.995
No, I have a fake ID.

21:38.095 --> 21:39.931
I'm 19, but I just can get it.

21:39.963 --> 21:45.971
I'm 19 too. Just had my
birthday a couple of weeks ago.

21:46.837 --> 21:50.274
Cool. Happy belated birthday.

21:50.307 --> 21:55.445
Thank you. Thanks.

21:55.479 --> 21:57.148
Here you go. Do you want some?

21:57.181 --> 21:58.750
Thanks.

22:02.319 --> 22:05.289
How do you get a fake ID?

22:05.323 --> 22:08.492
It's a really complicated
process that I

22:08.526 --> 22:12.163
feel like we should talk about
another time.

22:12.195 --> 22:14.398
Okay.

22:15.532 --> 22:17.701
Do you want to take your hoodie
off?

22:17.736 --> 22:20.839
Yeah. Yes, I do.

22:28.913 --> 22:29.714
Come here.

23:12.423 --> 23:13.758
Take your pants off.

23:13.857 --> 23:15.594
- Take my pants off?
- Take your pants off.

23:15.626 --> 23:16.161
Okay.

23:24.268 --> 23:25.836
A lot of things
happen I didn't want to.

23:37.515 --> 23:38.917
Take your shirt off too.

23:38.950 --> 23:39.683
Okay.

24:26.463 --> 24:27.566
Is this okay?

24:34.471 --> 24:37.074
What do you like?

24:37.173 --> 24:39.243
Just play the quiet game, okay?

24:40.310 --> 24:41.045
Okay.

24:58.262 --> 25:00.264
- Can I get back on top?
- Sure.

25:16.780 --> 25:18.883
I think all the blood
is my brain.

25:18.982 --> 25:23.221
Okay, that's fine. That's okay,
lay down.

25:26.557 --> 25:28.526
Do you want your clothes?

25:28.558 --> 25:30.094
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:30.126 --> 25:32.129
Here's your shirt.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.410
I'm really sorry.

25:45.509 --> 25:48.313
No, don't be. It's okay.

25:52.849 --> 25:56.620
Can you do the wrapper too?

25:59.324 --> 26:01.392
Thanks for being so nice.

26:01.424 --> 26:03.294
Yeah.

26:04.261 --> 26:09.099
My room is like 100 feet away
from your room.

26:09.133 --> 26:13.238
I'm going to skedaddle.

26:13.337 --> 26:16.774
You don't have to. I'm going to
be awake if you want to hang out.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.176
I was going to stay up and
drink wine.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.346
I'm just saying you don't have
to leave right now.

26:21.546 --> 26:23.314
I'm going to be awake.

26:23.414 --> 26:24.615
Are you sure?

26:24.647 --> 26:26.650
Yeah. I would feel weird if I
drink alone,

26:26.750 --> 26:27.817
but I feel like it could help
me sleep,

26:27.917 --> 26:29.653
so I was thinking that could be
good but

26:29.753 --> 26:32.589
also go. I feel like you were
trying to go.

26:32.690 --> 26:37.761
No, I wasn't. I thought it's because
I didn't, I would love to stay.

26:37.795 --> 26:39.197
Okay. You don't have to.

26:39.297 --> 26:41.566
No, I'd really like to.

26:41.598 --> 26:42.832
Okay.

26:42.866 --> 26:45.368
I can Venmo you by the way, I
will Venmo you.

26:45.603 --> 26:48.305
No, it's fine. This is $5 at
Target.

26:48.405 --> 26:49.440
You have a car?

26:49.472 --> 26:51.509
No, I walk there.

26:51.608 --> 26:56.780
I don't have a car either.
Kinda sucks, right?

26:56.814 --> 26:59.383
I like walking, but yeah, in
general,

26:59.583 --> 27:00.851
you want to make a friend with
a car.

27:00.951 --> 27:04.855
Yeah. None of
my friends have cars.

27:11.662 --> 27:13.298
So you're a sophomore, right?

27:13.330 --> 27:15.634
Yeah.

27:17.567 --> 27:23.641
Did you, did you have a tough
first year?

27:23.674 --> 27:27.478
What do you mean, like
adjusting?

27:27.510 --> 27:30.414
Yeah. In general.

27:31.315 --> 27:34.818
I don't know. Not really, why?

27:37.020 --> 27:38.956
I am.

27:38.990 --> 27:43.794
Yeah. I mean, I think everybody
struggles at first.

27:43.827 --> 27:47.330
Yeah, I'm struggling now.

27:47.365 --> 27:50.233
What's going on?

27:50.334 --> 27:51.402
Can I tell you a secret?

27:51.501 --> 27:52.336
Sure.

27:52.369 --> 27:54.471
I have zero friends.

27:54.704 --> 27:56.707
You just said you have friends.

27:56.807 --> 27:58.041
You said your friends don't
have cars.

27:58.142 --> 28:00.878
They don't have cars' cause
they're not real.

28:00.978 --> 28:02.880
You don't have zero friends.

28:02.980 --> 28:05.450
I definitely have zero friends.

28:05.982 --> 28:09.185
Like, you could say my roommate,

28:09.220 --> 28:10.453
Sam is a friend,

28:10.688 --> 28:15.293
but we hate each other and
aren't friends.

28:15.393 --> 28:17.461
Who do you hang out with?

28:19.262 --> 28:22.699
Timothy from the marketplace, I
hang out with.

28:22.732 --> 28:24.268
Like, thirty seconds a day.

28:24.468 --> 28:27.504
And, to be honest, I hang out
with my stuffed animal from

28:27.538 --> 28:30.708
home a lot. I talk to him.

28:30.740 --> 28:33.711
That's not true. I don't talk
to him.

28:33.743 --> 28:35.879
I more of just like spent a lot
of time in

28:35.913 --> 28:39.750
my room and my stuffed animals
in the room.

28:39.849 --> 28:43.487
I'm exaggerating.

28:44.756 --> 28:46.891
I have friends,

28:46.923 --> 28:49.326
but are those two of my closest
friends

28:49.426 --> 28:52.496
at college 100 percent.

28:57.167 --> 29:01.705
But it's okay because Timothy
is fucking awesome.

29:01.739 --> 29:02.940
I really like Timothy a lot.

29:03.039 --> 29:04.576
He's the warmest guy of all
time.

29:04.608 --> 29:06.510
He makes me feel so good every
day.

29:06.743 --> 29:08.711
He makes my skin feels good
when he talks.

29:08.746 --> 29:09.580
- I know what you mean.
- Yeah.

29:09.613 --> 29:10.480
Yeah.

29:10.580 --> 29:11.514
Also devastatingly good-looking.

29:11.714 --> 29:12.448
That's part of it.

29:12.549 --> 29:14.617
Yeah. For sure.

29:14.719 --> 29:17.188
Take this back.

29:21.025 --> 29:24.528
My turtle died today.

29:25.095 --> 29:28.598
Is that was supposed to be in
that tank on your desk?

29:28.632 --> 29:30.268
Mmhmm.

29:33.470 --> 29:37.375
I'm really sorry. That sucks.

29:37.474 --> 29:39.209
Thanks.

29:44.214 --> 29:47.250
I thought turtles were supposed
to like live forever.

29:47.284 --> 29:51.188
I did also and they don't, they
just die.

29:51.288 --> 29:53.223
What happened?

29:53.324 --> 29:55.459
I don't really know.

29:55.558 --> 30:01.465
He hadn't been eating so I
think he was sick or something

30:01.499 --> 30:03.934
and then he got stuck when I

30:03.968 --> 30:06.571
wasn't here maybe or when
swimming,

30:06.604 --> 30:12.143
was weak and drowned. I don't
know what happened.

30:13.309 --> 30:17.313
So, you've had, like a really
sad day.

30:17.748 --> 30:22.353
Yeah, I mean, whatever is just
a turtle.

30:22.385 --> 30:25.923
Yeah, he was my buddy.

30:27.790 --> 30:30.560
What was his name?

30:30.661 --> 30:31.895
Pete.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.031
That's a really good name for a
turtle.

30:34.131 --> 30:37.535
Thank you. It means rock, the
name Pete.

30:37.634 --> 30:39.269
Rock?

30:39.804 --> 30:40.905
Yes.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.640
That was pretty fitting?

30:42.673 --> 30:44.541
Yeah.

30:45.643 --> 30:48.512
Like he was a rock in life?

30:48.546 --> 30:49.814
Mmhmm.

30:49.846 --> 30:52.083
He held down the fort.

31:00.891 --> 31:02.727
I wish I could have met him.

31:02.826 --> 31:04.228
You know what? Same. I feel

31:04.327 --> 31:06.931
- like you guys that have really hit it off.
- Really?

31:07.030 --> 31:12.102
Yeah. He was
really sensitive also.

31:15.204 --> 31:17.708
What did you do with the body?

31:17.741 --> 31:19.943
Sorry, that's inconsiderate to
ask.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.846
I threw him away.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.116
You what?

31:25.516 --> 31:30.488
I threw him in the dumpster in
the back of.

31:30.520 --> 31:31.888
I can't tell if you're being
serious right now.

31:31.922 --> 31:32.855
What do you mean?

31:32.890 --> 31:34.658
You threw him away?

31:34.857 --> 31:36.793
Yeah. What else did I have done?

31:36.894 --> 31:39.962
You threw Pete away in the
dumpster?

31:40.063 --> 31:45.969
The Pete who you-your rock in
life, Pete?

31:46.068 --> 31:48.038
Yeah, I put him in a shoe box.

31:48.071 --> 31:51.274
Oh my God, that doesn't make it
any better. What?

31:51.307 --> 31:52.943
Okay.

31:53.576 --> 31:55.913
Didn't you want to bury him?

31:55.945 --> 31:57.414
Okay, you need to calm down.

31:57.515 --> 32:00.751
You can't just throw him away
in a dumpster,

32:00.784 --> 32:02.520
you can just get rid of him.

32:02.619 --> 32:03.987
What?

32:04.087 --> 32:05.423
You're never going to know
where his little body ends up.

32:05.455 --> 32:07.190
I don't want to know where his
little body ends up.

32:07.290 --> 32:08.326
Why?

32:08.425 --> 32:09.926
Because he's dead, what?

32:09.960 --> 32:12.363
Oh my God, you're a monster.

32:12.462 --> 32:14.531
I'm not a monster.

32:14.632 --> 32:16.933
Okay, you're not a monster.

32:16.967 --> 32:22.774
But I feel like we should, we
should...

32:22.807 --> 32:24.142
But did you put him in the
dumpster today?

32:24.174 --> 32:25.742
Mmhmm.

32:25.776 --> 32:26.710
Because it's like ice water?

32:26.910 --> 32:28.746
Yeah, and it's in your fucking
face.

32:28.778 --> 32:29.613
Yeah.

32:29.712 --> 32:30.815
I've thought about just not

32:30.914 --> 32:32.148
showering for the rest of my
time here.

32:32.182 --> 32:33.951
Oh my God, no. You're going to
get used to it.

32:33.984 --> 32:35.685
You've actually
gotten used to it?

32:35.786 --> 32:37.120
No, I feel like I've gotten
used to

32:37.153 --> 32:38.789
the fact that I'm not going to
get used to it.

32:38.823 --> 32:39.657
You know what I mean?

32:39.757 --> 32:40.758
Mmhmm.

32:40.958 --> 32:41.825
I don't know. I've been
exercising though,

32:42.058 --> 32:43.192
and I feel like that really
helps

32:43.292 --> 32:45.161
with the shower. Have you ever
tried that?

32:45.195 --> 32:46.798
No.

32:46.897 --> 32:49.265
Like, I don't know. I just go, I do the
elliptical thing and it's like really easy.

32:49.299 --> 32:51.034
I just go to the gym in
Burkas.

32:51.134 --> 32:52.736
There's a gym in Burkas?

32:52.970 --> 32:54.337
Yeah. Freshmen. Oh my God.

32:54.438 --> 32:57.942
Yeah. Okay. Are you entirely
sure?

32:57.974 --> 33:00.211
I'm entirely sure. Hold my wine.

33:07.085 --> 33:09.720
Oh, gosh. Having a little
trouble.

33:09.819 --> 33:10.520
Okay.

33:11.655 --> 33:14.057
Ow, why did you push me?

33:14.157 --> 33:15.325
I don't know, you're having
trouble.

33:15.358 --> 33:19.696
You just wanted to touch my
butt. Okay.

33:19.797 --> 33:21.565
Do you see anything?

33:21.932 --> 33:25.769
Yeah, I got my eyes on water
bottles.

33:25.970 --> 33:28.072
That's not trash, that's
recycle.

33:28.172 --> 33:33.043
Making these, wait is Pete
really small?

33:33.143 --> 33:34.010
Yeah, do you see him.

33:34.111 --> 33:35.813
Alright Pete, you are so stiff.

33:35.846 --> 33:37.079
I'm feeling like spooked right
now.

33:37.180 --> 33:39.350
Don't be, can I just see him.

33:43.953 --> 33:45.789
Is this the shoe box?

33:46.022 --> 33:47.391
Yeah.

33:52.895 --> 33:56.399
Okay, what'd you decide?
Where we off to?

33:56.500 --> 33:59.103
Think I'm gonna bury him on the
top of Mount Fiji, if that's okay.

33:59.202 --> 34:01.939
Yes, what? Like in Japan?

34:02.038 --> 34:04.240
No, it's Mount Fuji. What? No,
I'm talking

34:04.340 --> 34:06.442
about Mount Fiji like the
mountain on top of campus.

34:06.542 --> 34:07.911
Oh, yes.

34:08.012 --> 34:09.280
Oh It's called Mount Fiji.

34:09.380 --> 34:09.981
Yeah.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.481
Cool, that's much easier.

34:15.918 --> 34:16.820
L.A.?

34:17.021 --> 34:19.890
Yeah, like this campus, like
College.

34:19.922 --> 34:22.925
Yeah, why? Is it?

34:23.025 --> 34:25.462
No, it was nice hearing at Will.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.265
Where are you from?

34:27.297 --> 34:28.899
Dallas.

34:28.932 --> 34:30.835
Okay, so you're from Texas. I
feel like,

34:31.068 --> 34:32.403
you're like 1500 miles away

34:32.436 --> 34:33.804
from our house of course it's a
bit like your home.

34:33.903 --> 34:35.338
Okay, yeah where are you from?

34:35.438 --> 34:36.639
Bay area.

34:36.739 --> 34:38.908
That's like 500 miles away?

34:38.943 --> 34:40.111
Yes, like 400.

34:40.143 --> 34:42.979
Yeah, so you went far away from
home too?

34:43.079 --> 34:45.583
We both like, got

34:45.682 --> 34:48.085
dropped off in a place we don't
know anybody,

34:48.117 --> 34:49.453
and at the end of each day,

34:49.487 --> 34:55.092
we can't go home to our
parent's unconditional love.

34:55.125 --> 34:58.295
It's like we're
newborn babies here.

34:58.394 --> 35:02.298
But we don't have anybody to
hold us.

35:02.398 --> 35:07.538
What? Dude, I don't feel like a
newborn baby. I don't know.

35:07.637 --> 35:08.672
I got carried away.

35:08.771 --> 35:10.007
Yeah.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.208
I think kind of drunk right now
from the wine.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.708
I think you're very drunk from
the wine.

35:12.809 --> 35:13.945
Okay, sue me.

35:13.978 --> 35:15.846
Are you in any clubs?

35:15.945 --> 35:18.248
No, are you?

35:18.282 --> 35:21.351
No, I have friends. Okay, so
you know

35:21.451 --> 35:23.119
how like people think squirrels
are dumb

35:23.152 --> 35:24.888
because they run out of the
street and stuff?

35:25.088 --> 35:26.257
Yeah.

35:26.289 --> 35:27.490
I read an article one time and
said like

35:27.590 --> 35:29.426
squirrels are actually really
smart

35:29.460 --> 35:32.096
because the way you measure
intelligence is by how

35:32.128 --> 35:33.329
well an animal can adapt to

35:33.429 --> 35:35.632
their surroundings, you know
what I mean?

35:35.666 --> 35:40.137
Was that pointed?

35:40.170 --> 35:41.806
What, you think I'm
dumb because I'm having

35:41.838 --> 35:43.007
a tough time at College?

35:43.106 --> 35:45.909
No, I think you think
other people just turn

35:46.143 --> 35:47.345
their brain off when they get
here?

35:47.445 --> 35:49.913
Yeah, that's literally exactly
what I think.

35:50.146 --> 35:51.614
Like that's a perfect way of
putting it.

35:51.648 --> 35:53.317
I'm trying to tell you that's
not turning

35:53.349 --> 35:55.485
your brain off like that is
being intelligent.

35:55.518 --> 35:58.187
Okay well, I disagree with you
because you said it's how

35:58.288 --> 36:00.791
well they adapt and make use of
the place they're in,

36:00.824 --> 36:02.659
and what I'm telling you is
that people aren't

36:02.760 --> 36:05.062
taking advantage of the place
that they're in.

36:05.161 --> 36:06.297
What do you mean?

36:06.329 --> 36:07.864
4,000 people go here.

36:07.965 --> 36:11.035
4,000 people go to the same
school in the same place.

36:11.135 --> 36:12.803
4,000 people that don't owe you
anything, dude.

36:12.835 --> 36:15.338
You're not constantly being
stiffed by people.

36:15.371 --> 36:17.773
Okay, awesome, great. Got it.

36:17.873 --> 36:19.709
Like, I don't owe you anything.

36:19.742 --> 36:21.311
I don't owe you my time.

36:21.344 --> 36:23.079
I don't think you do.

36:23.179 --> 36:25.148
But I still want to hang out
with you,

36:25.181 --> 36:30.320
like I'm down to hang out with
you tonight.

36:30.353 --> 36:33.256
Yeah, I'm like, really fun to
be around.

36:35.025 --> 36:37.795
I'm fun to be around too,

36:37.894 --> 36:39.262
I'm really fun to be around.

36:39.362 --> 36:41.565
I don't know dude, you say you
don't have any friends.

36:41.664 --> 36:43.900
Yeah, because everybody fucking
sucks here.

36:44.001 --> 36:46.670
Oh, sorry, I forgot.
I forgot that.

36:46.702 --> 36:49.672
What I'm saying is like college
is and

36:49.706 --> 36:52.242
like it should be the most
selfish time in your life.

36:52.342 --> 36:53.777
Like the agenda here is not to

36:53.876 --> 36:55.913
learn how to be a great friend.

36:56.012 --> 36:57.980
Okay, what is the agenda?

36:58.215 --> 37:00.217
Figure out who you are?

37:00.251 --> 37:02.052
Actually it is.

37:02.085 --> 37:04.253
Whatever, look watch this
comeback.

37:04.353 --> 37:06.389
Yeah, I want other people to
help me in that.

37:06.422 --> 37:09.225
Like I want other people to be
a part of my identity.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.561
I think it's about like,
figuring out who you are

37:11.594 --> 37:14.130
separate from other people and
like taking care of yourself.

37:14.231 --> 37:15.533
Yeah, I just don't like college.

37:15.565 --> 37:18.568
I agree with you,

37:18.601 --> 37:20.069
but can you agree with me that
maybe

37:20.103 --> 37:21.571
we can add to that agenda,

37:21.605 --> 37:24.875
like learning how to better
look after each other.

37:24.909 --> 37:29.079
Hey, you guys want to play with
the Great Bambino?

37:29.112 --> 37:30.013
Any interest?

37:30.246 --> 37:31.013
Should I tell him we're busy?

37:31.248 --> 37:32.282
Why, what do you mean?

37:32.382 --> 37:33.583
To bury Pete.

37:33.617 --> 37:35.819
We can do it after softball.

37:35.918 --> 37:37.087
Tons of interest.

37:58.275 --> 38:00.443
One, two, three, Wolves.

38:00.476 --> 38:03.045
Hey, y'all ready yet?

38:03.480 --> 38:04.847
Yeah, we're ready, punks!

38:05.047 --> 38:07.517
Yeah, we got a new pitcher, so
it's about to be a comeback.

38:07.684 --> 38:08.451
You're pitching?

38:22.331 --> 38:24.733
- Fuck.
- Oh my God.

38:24.835 --> 38:27.103
Shit, oh my God.

38:27.137 --> 38:28.471
Are you okay?

38:28.505 --> 38:30.074
You suck at pitching.

38:30.273 --> 38:31.507
Yeah, Where did it hit?

38:31.608 --> 38:33.477
My calf. You are so bad at
pitching.

38:33.510 --> 38:35.711
I know, I'm so sorry. Wait
guys, do we have ice?

38:35.811 --> 38:36.947
Yeah. Go get some.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.181
No, it's okay. No, I don't need
ice. I'm all right.

38:38.282 --> 38:39.550
Are you sure?

38:39.650 --> 38:40.317
I'm all right. Yeah I know, he
sucks and pitching.

38:40.351 --> 38:41.686
It wasn't hard.

38:41.786 --> 38:48.525
Fuck, ow. It is not as not a
softball. It's a hardball.

38:48.625 --> 38:52.628
Dude, I'm so sorry.

38:52.661 --> 38:53.896
It's okay, It's
fine, I'm okay.

38:54.130 --> 38:57.366
I've like, I really truly have
never been so sorry.

38:57.467 --> 38:59.135
Oh my God, stop apologizing.

38:59.168 --> 39:01.105
You keep apologizing, then
you're going to be sorry.

39:01.304 --> 39:02.905
Because I'm going to knock your
block off.

39:03.005 --> 39:05.341
Protruding, Is that the word?

39:05.375 --> 39:07.311
Why don't we just get you ice,

39:07.344 --> 39:09.380
like let's go to Burt's off
campus.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.880
We can get our lunch there.

39:10.981 --> 39:12.482
It's such a waste of money.
It's fine. It's really fine.

39:12.581 --> 39:14.350
Okay. We can just walk there.
It's like super close.

39:14.385 --> 39:15.486
Okay, all right.

39:15.518 --> 39:18.755
If it gets out to here,
if it swells.

39:18.856 --> 39:19.990
If it get down to here?

39:20.023 --> 39:22.925
Yeah, like if it swells out
that far, then we'll go.

39:23.025 --> 39:23.960
Okay, how about here?

39:23.994 --> 39:24.961
Okay.

39:24.994 --> 39:25.895
Okay.

39:25.929 --> 39:26.931
Okay.

39:30.867 --> 39:32.702
Am I the first person

39:32.735 --> 39:35.105
you've had sex with at college?

39:36.639 --> 39:40.043
We didn't really have sex.

39:41.177 --> 39:47.284
Okay, am I first person you've
kissed naked at college?

39:47.384 --> 39:51.655
Yeah, yes.

39:51.688 --> 39:53.356
And you're the second person

39:53.389 --> 39:56.158
that I've kissed naked
in my life.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.429
I had a girlfriend in high
school,

39:58.528 --> 40:01.164
and we dated for like three
years.

40:02.432 --> 40:05.635
What happened? Did you break up
because of college?

40:05.735 --> 40:07.504
Yeah.

40:08.871 --> 40:12.007
I had a boyfriend
in high school also.

40:12.574 --> 40:14.878
There's just like senior year.

40:14.911 --> 40:18.815
Did you break up for college?
Like because the distance?

40:18.916 --> 40:24.155
No, we broke up because I kept
cheating on him.

40:34.797 --> 40:38.201
Yeah, I feel like that'll do it
for most high school relationships.

40:40.637 --> 40:42.606
Excuse me. I'm going to have to

40:42.639 --> 40:45.307
ask you guys to leave the
softball field.

40:45.409 --> 40:50.780
Yeah, when exactly are you going
to have to ask us to do that sir?

40:50.815 --> 40:52.615
Yeah, what time?

40:52.650 --> 40:55.286
Okay, I know it didn't get
swollen out to here,

40:55.318 --> 40:57.621
- but I really feel we should.
- No.

40:57.655 --> 41:02.859
I don't want to go. I don't want
to go. I don't want to go. Fuck.

41:02.960 --> 41:03.760
Does it hurt?

41:03.793 --> 41:05.327
Yeah, It hurts really bad.

41:05.427 --> 41:07.130
Did it get tight.

41:07.164 --> 41:08.465
Okay.

41:08.498 --> 41:09.666
- All right, let's go.
- We should go.

41:09.766 --> 41:10.933
I generally thought I was, but
I was just like

41:11.034 --> 41:13.537
a fucking asshole to everybody
all the time.

41:13.637 --> 41:14.771
Did you do theater?

41:14.804 --> 41:19.075
- Yes. Wait did you do theater?
- Yeah.

41:19.108 --> 41:22.112
Did you ever have the stage
managers that were really

41:22.144 --> 41:25.449
weirdly grumpy and jaded and
actually mean.

41:25.481 --> 41:27.717
I actually had really great
stage managers.

41:27.817 --> 41:32.222
Okay, cool. Well, I was a stage
manager and I was just

41:32.322 --> 41:33.957
really jealous of the actors

41:33.990 --> 41:36.025
because I always wanted to
audition for the play,

41:36.059 --> 41:36.994
but I never did.

41:37.094 --> 41:39.061
It really wasn't my vibe. So I
never did.

41:39.161 --> 41:40.362
You never auditioned?

41:40.463 --> 41:41.931
- No.
- Not even once?

41:42.032 --> 41:43.267
Not even once.

41:44.068 --> 41:45.969
So you just moved to L.A.

41:46.001 --> 41:47.903
to pursue your dream to become
a star?

41:48.003 --> 41:50.139
No. Oh my god. No.

41:50.172 --> 41:53.108
Wait, sorry. I think I'm getting
a phone call right now.

41:53.208 --> 41:56.646
Sorry. Yeah, this is my sister

41:56.679 --> 41:58.347
and I feel like I should answer
cause she was at a party.

41:58.380 --> 41:59.516
No go ahead.

41:59.550 --> 42:06.023
Right, sorry. Hello.

42:06.489 --> 42:07.590
Oh, fuck!

42:07.690 --> 42:11.427
Jesse! Margret off the phone, he
is sick.

42:11.527 --> 42:12.494
- He's fine!
- You're sick?

42:12.528 --> 42:14.565
I'm actually better, Mom.

42:14.664 --> 42:16.266
Why'd you call?
Is everything okay.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.570
Yeah. Boy. Yes.

42:21.471 --> 42:23.373
Are you drunk right now?

42:23.407 --> 42:25.307
- No.
- Yes.

42:25.342 --> 42:27.911
Alright. dork, well is that why you
called, to show me that you're drunk?

42:28.012 --> 42:31.148
- No, you all are haters.
- Yes.

42:31.181 --> 42:33.449
I'm not a hater. I think it's great
you drink. I just can't talk right now.

42:33.550 --> 42:35.318
I'm a hater, she's 15,

42:35.518 --> 42:36.720
she doesn't need to be drinking
already.

42:36.753 --> 42:38.121
Okay guys, it's so late there,

42:38.221 --> 42:39.155
you all go to sleep, I gotta go.

42:39.255 --> 42:42.358
Dallas doesn't sleep, boy.

42:42.391 --> 42:44.527
Oh my god, help me.
Are you outside,

42:44.561 --> 42:46.363
because you should be inside
getting rest.

42:46.396 --> 42:47.564
You should be inside getting
rest.

42:47.597 --> 42:49.533
Mom. I'm not sick,

42:49.565 --> 42:50.800
I'm with a friend, guys.

42:50.900 --> 42:52.635
That was allergies earlier I
think.

42:52.735 --> 42:55.338
I'm fine. But I have to go.

42:55.572 --> 42:58.240
Who are you with, are you with
a girl?

42:58.273 --> 43:00.976
Help me. Good bye.

43:01.744 --> 43:05.181
I'm so sorry that you had to
see that.

43:05.282 --> 43:06.083
No.

43:06.115 --> 43:07.250
I loved it.

43:07.284 --> 43:08.485
They're a lot.

43:08.585 --> 43:10.820
It seems like you guys are
really close.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.989
Yes.

43:17.360 --> 43:22.967
Yeah. Well, we go way back.

43:25.702 --> 43:29.137
I feel like I learned a ton
about you from that.

43:29.172 --> 43:30.206
Like what?

43:30.239 --> 43:32.508
I don't know. You have a really
cute sister and

43:32.608 --> 43:36.145
your mom is, like such a mom.

43:36.179 --> 43:36.980
She is such a mom.

43:37.012 --> 43:37.847
Yeah.

43:37.947 --> 43:40.616
She really leans in the mom
stuff.

43:40.650 --> 43:43.387
She gives lots of hugs.

43:44.621 --> 43:48.391
What about your dad, does he
give a lot of hugs?

43:49.293 --> 43:56.733
He used to, but my dad passed
away. He died.

43:57.601 --> 43:58.968
I'm sorry.

43:59.001 --> 44:00.469
It's fine.

44:00.804 --> 44:04.007
Has that like really affected
you?

44:04.041 --> 44:05.307
My dad dying?

44:05.342 --> 44:11.047
I'm so sorry. I just mean,

44:11.146 --> 44:14.418
how has it really affected you
I guess?

44:16.251 --> 44:21.023
I don't know. This is going to
sound weird,

44:21.123 --> 44:25.428
but I really don't think it's
affected me that much.

44:28.597 --> 44:31.434
I obviously miss having him
around,

44:31.668 --> 44:35.672
but I don't know,

44:35.706 --> 44:40.443
everything was and everything
has been okay.

44:41.210 --> 44:46.348
I don't know. Three months
before he died,

44:46.382 --> 44:47.650
he wrote me and my sister

44:47.684 --> 44:50.454
this letter and at the end of
the letter,

44:50.487 --> 44:54.190
it said that our names will
forever be carved into

44:54.291 --> 45:01.465
his heart and that just like
really I don't know.

45:02.199 --> 45:04.568
Wow, he wrote that.

45:04.668 --> 45:08.105
Yeah. I know, right.

45:10.106 --> 45:12.442
Oh, fuck dude.

45:12.541 --> 45:14.344
- Oh shit.
- It's closed.

45:14.378 --> 45:17.681
Oh, my god. Wait. No, I thought it
was supposed to be open 24 hours.

45:17.715 --> 45:21.218
Yeah, so did I, what are we
going to do for ice?

45:22.652 --> 45:25.255
Do you think this thing is cold.

45:25.289 --> 45:26.623
Seven stories?

45:26.722 --> 45:27.690
Okay.

45:27.724 --> 45:29.492
Okay, Jeff.

45:30.592 --> 45:33.797
What are your parents like?

45:34.697 --> 45:38.568
They're fine, just like parents.

45:38.601 --> 45:40.737
That's super boring.

45:40.769 --> 45:42.505
I know, they they suck.

45:42.739 --> 45:44.740
I just felt like you just said
your dad is dead,

45:44.773 --> 45:48.277
so I didn't want to complain
about my parents?

45:51.914 --> 45:55.518
Why do they suck.

45:57.686 --> 46:00.222
My dad's, like a loser and my

46:00.257 --> 46:02.726
mom's, like really cold and
distant because she

46:02.759 --> 46:04.827
chose such a fucking asshole to

46:04.927 --> 46:08.164
be the father of her children,
I think.

46:09.731 --> 46:11.534
Are they divorced?

46:11.768 --> 46:14.536
Oh yeah. Oh yeah,
they're divorced.

46:14.737 --> 46:16.539
They got divorced when I was in
first grade

46:16.739 --> 46:21.777
and my mom's, like dating a guy
named Bruce Now.

46:21.811 --> 46:23.546
Do you like Bruce?

46:23.746 --> 46:25.047
I don't know Bruce.

46:25.081 --> 46:26.583
He seems fine. I don't know,
he's kind of weird.

46:26.615 --> 46:28.550
I just met him, like one time,
though.

46:28.784 --> 46:31.554
Do you have a relationship with
your dad?

46:32.655 --> 46:35.559
I haven't spoken to him since I
was 15.

46:35.759 --> 46:36.559
What?

46:36.793 --> 46:37.760
Yeah.

46:37.793 --> 46:39.596
Oh my god, what?

46:39.628 --> 46:40.663
Yeah.

46:40.764 --> 46:42.265
My sister and I told

46:42.297 --> 46:44.332
him we hated him and we never
want to

46:44.434 --> 46:49.039
talk to him again and he just
listened to that.

46:51.108 --> 46:56.146
He, like actually got remarried
two years ago and

46:56.179 --> 46:59.115
didn't invite us to the wedding

46:59.148 --> 47:01.218
and, like this is a really big
wedding and

47:01.318 --> 47:02.285
all my aunts and uncles

47:02.385 --> 47:04.588
like and grandparents and
stuff were there.

47:07.023 --> 47:09.791
That's super mature.

47:09.826 --> 47:10.994
Yeah. That's I mean,

47:11.027 --> 47:14.597
he's just, like a fuckin' loser.

47:16.965 --> 47:20.269
Does it make you more sad or
more angry?

47:20.369 --> 47:24.340
What?

47:24.373 --> 47:27.009
Like, your dad being,

47:27.643 --> 47:33.850
does your shitty dad make you
more sad or more angry?

47:39.289 --> 47:42.692
I don't know. I guess neither
honestly.

47:42.724 --> 47:44.260
It's just been bad with him for
so long,

47:44.360 --> 47:46.828
that I don't feel a lot about
it.

47:46.862 --> 47:49.565
I don't feel angry or sad or
anything.

47:49.666 --> 47:54.771
Sometimes I feel sad on his
behalf.

47:54.871 --> 47:57.907
It's so sad that he doesn't.

47:58.007 --> 48:00.342
I don't know, maybe this sounds
conceited,

48:00.376 --> 48:02.778
but my sister and I grew up to
be like

48:02.880 --> 48:06.883
such cool people and he doesn't
get to know that,

48:06.916 --> 48:12.255
it's sad for him. It's shitty.

48:12.355 --> 48:14.856
- Wow, I almost killed that guy.
- Yeah.

48:14.891 --> 48:16.526
That would have been his fault
totally though.

48:16.559 --> 48:20.497
Yeah, right. He didn't have the
white pedestrian light.

48:20.597 --> 48:22.732
White pedestrian light?

48:22.764 --> 48:24.900
You mean the green pedestrian
light?

48:24.934 --> 48:26.870
I'm talking about the person.

48:26.902 --> 48:30.673
Yeah. The person's green, right?

48:32.775 --> 48:35.444
I think he's white.

48:35.478 --> 48:37.880
Jeff, I'm pretty sure.

48:37.914 --> 48:40.383
It's green, like the red hand,

48:40.416 --> 48:43.987
so that would mean the person's
green.

48:44.086 --> 48:46.456
You all are both colorblind.

48:46.489 --> 48:47.891
It's absolutely white.

48:47.923 --> 48:49.259
Well, I'm actually colorblind,

48:49.291 --> 48:50.525
but she thinks it's green too.

48:50.626 --> 48:52.229
I'm actually colorblind also.

48:52.262 --> 48:54.497
- You're what?
- You're both colorblind.

48:54.597 --> 48:55.699
Yeah.

48:55.731 --> 48:57.067
I thought girls can't be color
blind.

48:57.166 --> 48:59.702
Women can be colorblind it's
just 0.3% of them are so.

48:59.902 --> 49:01.671
We're both colorblind?

49:01.771 --> 49:02.938
Yeah, that's crazy.

49:02.972 --> 49:04.774
That Is crazy. have you guys
heard of

49:04.807 --> 49:08.311
those glasses like cures,

49:08.411 --> 49:12.282
with the videos, are they
expensive?

49:12.315 --> 49:12.914
Yeah.

49:12.949 --> 49:14.550
I don't know. I feel

49:14.583 --> 49:15.951
like I would never want to wear
them because then I

49:16.052 --> 49:19.456
have to take them off and reckon
without them.

49:19.556 --> 49:23.293
I want to try it at least once
and have that experience.

49:23.327 --> 49:24.294
- That's crazy that you're colorblind.
- Yeah.

49:24.327 --> 49:26.963
Are you allergic to peanuts?

49:26.996 --> 49:28.797
No. Wait why?

49:28.831 --> 49:29.999
I'm just checking.

49:30.099 --> 49:31.801
I'm allergic to gluten.

49:31.833 --> 49:33.536
Really? That's, like a bad one.

49:33.635 --> 49:34.938
Yeah, tell me about it.

49:34.971 --> 49:37.541
You're colorblind and allergic
to peanuts?

49:37.641 --> 49:38.976
Yes.

49:39.009 --> 49:42.646
I wouldn't survive a day in the
before Christ days.

49:42.679 --> 49:43.945
No, you would've been fine,

49:43.980 --> 49:46.983
you just would have had to find
a good partner.

49:47.016 --> 49:50.019
Don't look at me. I'm
colorblind.

49:50.119 --> 49:52.688
I would have been the only
colorblind woman

49:52.788 --> 49:54.724
alive in Mesopotamia.

50:11.340 --> 50:14.076
Maybe I really should have him
cremated.

50:14.175 --> 50:16.846
So you can keep in your room?

50:16.878 --> 50:20.849
I'm down to cremate him, if you
want.

50:20.882 --> 50:22.618
I'll go on another adventure.

50:22.652 --> 50:30.293
No, I'm just procrastinating.
Okay. Let's do this.

50:36.800 --> 50:39.535
Can you help me?

50:39.568 --> 50:41.403
Yeah. Are you okay?

50:41.505 --> 50:42.939
It's just weird.
This is so weird.

50:43.039 --> 50:45.342
Yeah, I know it's just so weird,

50:45.375 --> 50:47.710
burying a dead body is the
weirdest thing ever.

50:47.742 --> 50:50.346
It's so fucking weird

50:50.378 --> 50:52.414
But we can slow down. We don't
have to do it right now.

50:52.514 --> 50:55.484
We can l take our time, I feel
like we are rushing.

50:58.987 --> 51:01.056
Here, let me do this.

51:01.090 --> 51:05.027
What are you doing?

51:05.061 --> 51:07.063
I'm going to take Pete out of
the whole

51:07.097 --> 51:13.102
and keep him out, so he's
visible.

51:13.202 --> 51:14.838
It was nice seeing him

51:14.871 --> 51:16.972
before I realize we haven't
looked at him all night.

51:17.072 --> 51:19.040
He's been in the shoe box?

51:19.074 --> 51:21.843
Yeah and he is a beautiful
turtle.

51:22.077 --> 51:23.679
Thank you.

51:24.547 --> 51:26.849
Did you have something to do
with that?

51:27.083 --> 51:28.451
Yeah. I gave birth to him.

51:34.056 --> 51:36.125
Do you believe in God?

51:38.094 --> 51:42.666
On airplanes, I do.

51:42.766 --> 51:43.800
It's like anytime, I can't

51:43.900 --> 51:45.468
even pretend to have any
control.

51:45.501 --> 51:48.103
Yeah. Yes.

51:48.137 --> 51:50.874
Feel like, when I think about
dying,

51:51.074 --> 51:54.311
I'm just like, see you soon,
big guy.

52:00.449 --> 52:05.889
Yeah. Death sucks, I'm not okay
with it. Death is ass.

52:11.226 --> 52:13.596
I can't believe that

52:13.628 --> 52:15.798
like everything is just going
to vanish.

52:15.831 --> 52:17.366
Yeah.

52:27.811 --> 52:31.181
So that's going to vanish for
me to though,

52:31.280 --> 52:34.583
you're not alone in that.

52:46.630 --> 52:48.197
- Maggie?
- Yes.

52:48.297 --> 52:50.199
- Are you okay?
- Mmhmm.

52:50.867 --> 52:54.137
Yeah I'm okay.

52:54.170 --> 52:56.172
I'm fine. I'm okay.
I'm all right.

52:56.204 --> 53:00.543
Let's do it,

53:00.643 --> 53:02.177
I'm ready to do the burial.
Let's do this.

53:02.210 --> 53:04.212
Okay. Yes, I totally agree but
can I say,

53:04.313 --> 53:05.948
can I throw out an idea?

53:06.181 --> 53:07.282
Go ahead.

53:07.315 --> 53:08.083
Okay. Well, like earlier I was
going to

53:08.284 --> 53:09.418
suggest that you say some words

53:09.518 --> 53:10.320
and I was thinking at first
that it would

53:10.353 --> 53:11.820
be after you buried him.

53:11.853 --> 53:14.423
But now I'm thinking that
doesn't make any sense and you

53:14.523 --> 53:17.993
should just say words now,
while he is out.

53:18.027 --> 53:19.596
Okay.

53:19.829 --> 53:26.970
Let's do it. Can you start and I'll
just close? I'm just going to close.

53:27.202 --> 53:27.938
Yeah.

53:31.240 --> 53:38.179
Pete. I really wish I could have
known you when you

53:38.213 --> 53:41.985
were able to move around and
hang out.

53:42.184 --> 53:45.221
I can tell Maggie really likes
you a ton.

53:45.255 --> 53:51.661
So I'm really bummed that we
couldn't be friends.

53:52.193 --> 53:55.364
But I'm really really glad that

53:55.398 --> 53:59.536
you were such a great friend to
Maggie for so long.

53:59.568 --> 54:03.404
Because she's really awesome

54:03.438 --> 54:06.241
and I feel like you had a lot
to do with that.

54:06.275 --> 54:10.012
So good job.

54:10.579 --> 54:13.583
You did a really good job.

54:13.615 --> 54:18.288
Being alive and being a friend.

54:25.394 --> 54:28.396
Pete, I have not

54:28.431 --> 54:32.302
dealt with as much tragedy and
loss as Alex has,

54:32.402 --> 54:38.041
so my eulogy is going to
fuckin' blow comparatively.

54:41.242 --> 54:43.778
Yeah. I mean, Alex was right,

54:43.878 --> 54:47.415
you were a really good friend
and you were

54:47.449 --> 54:51.887
a really great listener and I
really felt like,

54:51.920 --> 54:55.023
I could cut through all the
bullshit with you,

54:55.123 --> 54:57.493
which was really nice.

55:00.797 --> 55:05.668
I don't know, it's going to
suck.

55:05.768 --> 55:11.974
I know, it's going to suck when I-I
don't know, it's gonna suck when I-

55:36.132 --> 55:39.402
I feel like we're going to
start feeling, hung over.

55:39.501 --> 55:41.237
Should we have like a beer or
something?

55:41.336 --> 55:43.472
Level ourselves out?

55:44.005 --> 55:48.576
Yeah. Sure. I'm not like dying
for Brewski.

55:48.677 --> 55:50.880
But I'll have one,
if you have one.

55:56.018 --> 55:58.586
What about Dos Equises?

55:58.686 --> 56:00.822
No, yeah, all beer tastes the

56:00.856 --> 56:05.194
same minus the IPA stuff,
whatever.

56:05.228 --> 56:08.097
Dose of kisses.

56:09.164 --> 56:12.034
That's clever.

56:22.043 --> 56:27.715
What's up? Not a lot of chuckle
is coming from the audience.

56:27.750 --> 56:32.088
You guys tired?
Y'all hungover?

56:32.188 --> 56:33.590
No. You're just not funny.

56:35.557 --> 56:41.230
Oh, you're just not attractive,
so how's that? Yeah, I know.

56:41.262 --> 56:43.065
I heard a couple of you say it,

56:43.166 --> 56:46.602
it's yeah, I'm hung over too.
I'm hung over too.

56:46.702 --> 56:48.604
I was actually
going to wake up and

56:48.704 --> 56:50.039
write some jokes for you all
today,

56:50.072 --> 56:54.978
but instead, I had to clean
shit off my floor.

56:56.211 --> 56:59.280
Shit my pants.

56:59.380 --> 57:04.820
Too much Schlitz that'll get
you.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.588
Oh my what is this?

57:06.621 --> 57:09.125
Open mic and muffins,

57:09.224 --> 57:13.028
wow. That's an idea.

57:24.673 --> 57:25.608
Hey.

57:25.641 --> 57:26.442
Hey.

57:26.476 --> 57:28.711
Can you hand me my shirt?

57:28.811 --> 57:29.512
Yeah.

57:33.481 --> 57:36.184
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

57:36.284 --> 57:37.820
I'll turn around.

57:45.795 --> 57:49.666
Hey, do you know that you talk
in your sleep?

57:49.699 --> 57:51.267
What?

57:51.300 --> 57:52.468
Are you dressed? Can I turn
around?

57:52.501 --> 57:59.108
- Yeah.
- You talk in your sleep.

57:59.141 --> 58:02.144
Last night, in the middle of
the night I woke up to a

58:02.177 --> 58:04.380
noise and it was you,

58:04.480 --> 58:06.481
you had a blanket right
here and you were

58:06.514 --> 58:08.518
holding it really tight and
you're like,

58:08.617 --> 58:10.985
it's okay and I was like,

58:11.019 --> 58:12.822
Maggie are you okay?

58:12.855 --> 58:16.992
You're like, yeah I'm totally
fine.

58:17.092 --> 58:20.829
It was probably the sweetest
thing I've ever seen.

58:20.862 --> 58:25.268
I don't know, I was really
drunk last night, I guess.

58:25.735 --> 58:28.304
When we fell asleep?

58:28.336 --> 58:30.539
Yeah.

58:30.639 --> 58:32.509
I mean, yeah, I guess we
did have a ton of

58:32.541 --> 58:36.978
wine and I am feeling pretty
hung over, right now,

58:37.012 --> 58:42.652
Yeah. Sorry. I have to start my
day and stuff.

58:42.684 --> 58:45.487
Do you mind if I just get
past you?

58:45.521 --> 58:46.355
Yeah. I'm blocking you.

58:46.387 --> 58:48.257
Yeah.

58:55.530 --> 58:57.532
You're still here.

58:57.565 --> 59:02.303
Yeah. I put my clothes on now.

59:02.704 --> 59:05.740
Sorry. Can I just sip that
water?

59:05.840 --> 59:07.576
Oh your doing it, can I have it
after?

59:07.677 --> 59:09.612
- Sure.
- Thanks.

59:13.815 --> 59:16.552
When you were gone, I remembered

59:16.585 --> 59:19.020
an insane dream I had last
night.

59:19.054 --> 59:24.326
You and I were floating in
space and then we

59:24.527 --> 59:26.762
saw George Clooney and

59:26.862 --> 59:29.298
then he asked us how Sandra
Bullock was doing.

59:29.398 --> 59:34.170
That's insane. Let me make my
bed.

59:34.269 --> 59:35.336
Have you seen that movie?

59:35.570 --> 59:37.339
No, I haven't.

59:37.539 --> 59:40.509
It's called "Gravity"

59:40.541 --> 59:42.778
with Sandra Bullock and George
Clooney.

59:42.811 --> 59:43.645
Yeah.

59:43.679 --> 59:45.547
I think it won a bunch of
Oscars

59:45.581 --> 59:48.351
like 2014 or something.

59:54.690 --> 59:57.326
Hey, do you want to go get

59:57.427 --> 59:59.193
a breakfast burrito or
something?

59:59.293 --> 1:00:01.129
At Tropicana? I haven't been,

1:00:01.230 --> 1:00:04.567
but Sam talks about it a lot
and just be a little walk?

1:00:04.599 --> 1:00:05.967
Yeah. Sorry. I just like

1:00:06.068 --> 1:00:08.604
that's sounds like a ton to me
right now.

1:00:09.170 --> 1:00:11.940
Okay. I feel like you're really
grumpy right now and

1:00:11.974 --> 1:00:13.909
you want me to leave,
is that correct?

1:00:13.943 --> 1:00:16.178
I'm not really grumpy, I have a
lot to do today,

1:00:16.411 --> 1:00:19.447
so I'm freaking out about that.
So I want to start.

1:00:19.481 --> 1:00:21.316
Yeah, I get that.
I understand that.

1:00:21.416 --> 1:00:22.851
That makes sense, I just feel

1:00:22.951 --> 1:00:26.755
like I'm missing something
right now.

1:00:26.789 --> 1:00:29.392
I don't know what you mean.

1:00:46.376 --> 1:00:49.644
I just want to knock on her
door. I don't know.

1:00:49.677 --> 1:00:51.079
Well then knock on her door.

1:00:51.179 --> 1:00:52.213
Oh my God Mom, I cant,

1:00:52.414 --> 1:00:53.549
That's what I'm trying to tell
you, I can't do that.

1:00:53.648 --> 1:00:55.016
She doesn't want that.

1:00:55.050 --> 1:00:56.619
Okay. Well, I don't know what
you want me to say here.

1:00:56.652 --> 1:00:58.420
Okay. I've shared my thoughts.

1:00:58.653 --> 1:01:00.088
She's your best friend.

1:01:00.188 --> 1:01:02.625
You knock on her door, you say
Emily, I'm sorry I fucked up.

1:01:02.657 --> 1:01:03.992
Okay, bye mum, bye Mom
bye Mom, bye Mom.

1:01:04.025 --> 1:01:06.663
Wait, is Josh involved in this?

1:01:41.731 --> 1:01:43.666
Can we be ready?

1:01:43.699 --> 1:01:45.901
Yes. I'm so starving.

1:01:46.001 --> 1:01:48.037
Hey, do you have a stopping
point soon?

1:01:48.070 --> 1:01:49.838
No, not yet. Just go without
me, I'm here.

1:01:49.871 --> 1:01:51.706
Maggie, when is this due?

1:01:51.740 --> 1:01:52.740
Oh my God, soon.

1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:54.576
But what does soon mean?

1:01:54.677 --> 1:01:55.978
Next week.

1:01:56.079 --> 1:01:57.579
Oh, bitch, no.

1:01:57.679 --> 1:01:59.481
- Of course, no.
- No.

1:01:59.715 --> 1:02:01.451
Sorry. I'm just on a roll.

1:02:02.751 --> 1:02:05.153
Guys, this is really important.

1:02:05.253 --> 1:02:06.355
Oh my God.

1:02:06.389 --> 1:02:08.323
Excuse me, everyone. My friend
here is on a roll.

1:02:08.422 --> 1:02:09.790
Eyes forward and keep it down.

1:02:09.891 --> 1:02:12.561
She's on a roll. Sir, I hate to
bother you.

1:02:12.594 --> 1:02:13.896
I'm so sorry, sir.

1:02:13.929 --> 1:02:16.532
Do you see my friend over here?

1:02:16.565 --> 1:02:21.068
I'm so sorry to bother you. She's on
a roll and this is very distracting.

1:02:21.103 --> 1:02:21.971
My knees.

1:02:22.070 --> 1:02:23.304
Yeah, it's distracting her.

1:02:23.505 --> 1:02:24.840
It's really loud,
because she's on a roll.

1:02:24.940 --> 1:02:26.474
You're the worst people in the
whole world.

1:02:26.574 --> 1:02:28.076
What's up, dick cheese.

1:02:28.110 --> 1:02:28.911
Hey.

1:02:33.514 --> 1:02:35.483
Where did you sleep last night?

1:02:35.583 --> 1:02:40.522
I actually slept in this girl's
room.

1:02:40.722 --> 1:02:44.960
Oh, pussy boy. Great.

1:02:46.195 --> 1:02:49.432
Are you about to smoke a
cigarette?

1:02:49.465 --> 1:02:51.500
Can you not be a bitch?

1:02:51.601 --> 1:02:54.303
Juul's charging. I need
something.

1:02:54.402 --> 1:02:59.541
Okay. What if you and I get
high together instead?

1:03:00.909 --> 1:03:03.746
You want to smoke weed with me?

1:03:03.778 --> 1:03:06.782
Yeah, smoke weed.

1:03:07.648 --> 1:03:10.618
Fine.

1:03:13.155 --> 1:03:14.056
Shit.

1:03:14.088 --> 1:03:14.956
Sorry, this is going to sound
weird,

1:03:15.056 --> 1:03:17.826
but could you light it for me?

1:03:17.925 --> 1:03:20.762
Yeah. I didn't know you've
never smoked weed before.

1:03:20.795 --> 1:03:23.865
No I have, but in high school I
did some but

1:03:23.965 --> 1:03:26.567
my girlfriend would always
light it for

1:03:26.768 --> 1:03:29.237
me because I always burned my
thumb.

1:03:29.338 --> 1:03:30.305
Oh, yeah.

1:03:30.405 --> 1:03:32.074
Yeah, that's the gayest thing
I've heard.

1:03:32.173 --> 1:03:33.742
Go for it.

1:03:33.842 --> 1:03:38.246
She made me feel like such a weirdo for
asking to go get breakfast burritos.

1:03:38.347 --> 1:03:42.018
I've been there.

1:03:42.050 --> 1:03:43.518
When?

1:03:43.619 --> 1:03:44.853
Huh?

1:03:44.887 --> 1:03:47.789
You said been there. When have
you been there?

1:03:47.822 --> 1:03:49.157
No, no, no, no, no.

1:03:49.190 --> 1:03:53.395
It's just like, "Damn, man,
I've been there.".

1:03:55.398 --> 1:03:58.400
I don't, wait what?

1:04:00.001 --> 1:04:07.810
I mean, I haven't actually been there, but
I was just for you, it's like, been there.

1:04:08.143 --> 1:04:09.845
But you haven't actually been
there?

1:04:09.878 --> 1:04:12.048
I'm here for you.

1:04:18.019 --> 1:04:19.688
There another party tonight.

1:04:19.722 --> 1:04:22.658
Where? Diary Velma house?

1:04:22.690 --> 1:04:27.929
No. Basketball house or where
the basketball team lives.

1:04:28.030 --> 1:04:31.033
I don't think I'm up for
another party tonight.

1:04:31.065 --> 1:04:35.836
Are you, after last night
when you shit your pants?

1:04:37.373 --> 1:04:40.075
I mean, like. I just need to
hydrate,

1:04:40.175 --> 1:04:44.546
take a nap and I'll probably
just jerk off,

1:04:44.579 --> 1:04:45.646
smoke more, I'll be ready.

1:04:45.847 --> 1:04:47.615
How do you always know about
all the parties?

1:04:47.715 --> 1:04:49.884
The senior water polo guys

1:04:49.918 --> 1:04:51.353
have a document called the
parties

1:04:51.385 --> 1:04:53.154
schedule and they put it in our
group text.

1:04:58.460 --> 1:04:58.793
Yeah.

1:05:01.896 --> 1:05:03.965
But yeah, this one's saying
that you got

1:05:04.065 --> 1:05:07.869
to wear a wig to the party.

1:05:13.943 --> 1:05:15.744
This one, it says that you have
to wear a wig.

1:05:15.777 --> 1:05:18.746
We have to wear wigs?

1:05:22.050 --> 1:05:23.119
If I send someone a message on

1:05:23.152 --> 1:05:24.753
Insta, can I see if they've
seen it?

1:05:24.786 --> 1:05:27.455
Yeah, it will say "seen".

1:05:27.489 --> 1:05:30.659
What?

1:05:30.759 --> 1:05:31.592
Shit.

1:05:31.693 --> 1:05:34.396
Let me see that? Oh, my God.

1:05:34.429 --> 1:05:38.601
Dude, you sent her so many
messages?

1:05:38.634 --> 1:05:39.635
Yeah.

1:05:39.735 --> 1:05:40.836
What?

1:05:40.869 --> 1:05:42.004
It's not like we're in middle
school,

1:05:42.103 --> 1:05:44.572
we don't play games or to be
elusive?

1:05:44.606 --> 1:05:46.909
Were the first eight flags not
right enough,

1:05:46.942 --> 1:05:49.510
you just want to set a brighter
one?

1:05:50.846 --> 1:05:52.079
That's her right there. That's
right there.

1:05:52.181 --> 1:05:53.782
She's going to get a wig. She's
going to go a wig.

1:05:53.815 --> 1:05:54.548
What? So?

1:05:54.650 --> 1:05:56.184
We go this way.

1:05:58.721 --> 1:06:00.755
I'll be right here.

1:06:00.789 --> 1:06:02.158
Hey, what's going on?

1:06:02.257 --> 1:06:04.659
Oh, we don't need any help.
Thank you.

1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:05.794
Oh, no, we don't work here.

1:06:05.827 --> 1:06:08.429
Yeah. We go to school with
you-all.

1:06:08.463 --> 1:06:10.132
Oh, hey. Do you guys sell water
bottles?

1:06:10.166 --> 1:06:11.333
We don't work here.

1:06:11.432 --> 1:06:13.735
Yeah. I mean, I sell Juulpods
but that's all.

1:06:13.969 --> 1:06:15.070
Yeah. We don't work here.

1:06:15.103 --> 1:06:16.304
We go to school with you-all.
Maggie.

1:06:16.338 --> 1:06:17.006
Hey.

1:06:17.106 --> 1:06:18.740
You guys know each other?

1:06:18.940 --> 1:06:20.442
No. We all go to school
together.

1:06:20.474 --> 1:06:25.514
He already said that.
Okay. See you.

1:06:25.547 --> 1:06:25.880
That's great.

1:06:25.981 --> 1:06:27.750
Yeah.

1:06:28.583 --> 1:06:31.486
Yikes. That was horrible.

1:06:31.519 --> 1:06:32.320
Yeah.

1:06:32.355 --> 1:06:34.123
That was so bad.

1:06:34.155 --> 1:06:37.492
My heart just like dropped out
of my butt-hole just now.

1:06:37.525 --> 1:06:38.893
Wait, your heart what?

1:06:38.994 --> 1:06:40.062
Why is she playing games?

1:06:40.161 --> 1:06:41.395
She's like playing games with
me.

1:06:41.496 --> 1:06:43.231
I mean, it doesn't seem like
she's playing games.

1:06:43.331 --> 1:06:46.969
It just seems more like she
doesn't want to talk to you.

1:06:47.001 --> 1:06:50.905
Are you sure that was the girl?

1:06:51.005 --> 1:06:53.208
Yeah, that was the girl.

1:06:53.307 --> 1:06:55.844
Well, she's weird. It just
seems like she

1:06:55.876 --> 1:06:58.480
didn't know that you existed.

1:06:58.514 --> 1:07:04.086
I mean, you know, shit gets dark sometimes.
Do you have good vision?

1:07:04.186 --> 1:07:07.623
I'm ready for a night. I'm
fucking ready.

1:07:07.655 --> 1:07:09.858
I'm kinda nervous. I feel like I
want to see

1:07:09.891 --> 1:07:12.359
Maggie and I'm going to act
super dumb.

1:07:12.393 --> 1:07:13.361
Oh, dude.

1:07:13.394 --> 1:07:15.998
You got to stop that shit, man.

1:07:16.030 --> 1:07:18.199
Honestly, look at me,

1:07:18.233 --> 1:07:19.802
just get her out of your head.

1:07:20.001 --> 1:07:21.170
Don't even think about it.

1:07:21.202 --> 1:07:24.206
You don't talk to her.
That's the move.

1:07:24.239 --> 1:07:27.408
You talk to other girls and
then she sees that you're

1:07:27.509 --> 1:07:31.179
not the little bitch that you
always claim that you are.

1:07:31.213 --> 1:07:32.848
I never claim that I was.

1:07:32.882 --> 1:07:34.883
Yeah, you do, you do, man.
Come on.

1:07:34.916 --> 1:07:36.718
Don't talk to her tonight, okay?

1:07:36.818 --> 1:07:39.622
Amp up, what are you going to do?
What are you going to do tonight?

1:07:39.722 --> 1:07:40.890
Not talk to Maggie.

1:07:40.922 --> 1:07:43.691
Not talk to Maggie.
Not talk to Maggie.

1:07:43.726 --> 1:07:45.561
- Not talk to Maggie.
- Not talk to Maggie.

1:07:45.661 --> 1:07:47.463
- Not talk to Maggie.
- Not talk to Maggie.

1:07:47.563 --> 1:07:49.064
- Not talk to Maggie.
- Not talk to Maggie.

1:07:50.998 --> 1:07:53.868
- Can I come in yet?
- <i>No, you got to stay out there for a few more minutes.</i>

1:07:53.902 --> 1:07:54.502
You know what, fuck you too,
bro.

1:07:59.074 --> 1:08:00.943
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:08:01.043 --> 1:08:02.478
- What's up?
- My guys.

1:08:02.577 --> 1:08:03.778
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

1:08:03.878 --> 1:08:05.146
Where y'all goin'?

1:08:05.179 --> 1:08:06.847
We're going into the party,
Basketball House.

1:08:07.081 --> 1:08:09.150
It's not an open party.

1:08:09.418 --> 1:08:10.786
Yeah.

1:08:10.885 --> 1:08:12.219
We have wigs on. Yeah.

1:08:12.253 --> 1:08:15.223
I can see that, but neither of
you have tits,

1:08:15.257 --> 1:08:18.326
so you're going to have to know
someone on their team.

1:08:18.426 --> 1:08:21.430
Yeah. No other house has
that rule, man.

1:08:21.462 --> 1:08:23.398
I understand that. I get what
you're saying, but see,

1:08:23.431 --> 1:08:25.067
Basketball House is a little
different,

1:08:25.100 --> 1:08:25.967
and if you don't know anybody.

1:08:26.068 --> 1:08:27.702
Oh, we know Jay.

1:08:27.802 --> 1:08:29.938
You know Jay?

1:08:29.970 --> 1:08:31.372
Yeah.

1:08:31.472 --> 1:08:32.073
Yeah.

1:08:32.106 --> 1:08:32.975
You know Jay?

1:08:33.074 --> 1:08:34.475
He's in the basketball team.

1:08:34.510 --> 1:08:35.944
Big guy, tall.

1:08:35.978 --> 1:08:37.179
Tall Jay.

1:08:37.212 --> 1:08:38.647
It's all good, man. Go ahead
and go have fun.

1:08:38.747 --> 1:08:41.083
It's a good night, you know
what I mean?

1:08:41.115 --> 1:08:42.516
Everybody's having fun.

1:08:42.618 --> 1:08:45.020
Not me, clearly.

1:08:45.119 --> 1:08:48.724
Oh, wow. You need to outdo
party animals.

1:08:48.823 --> 1:08:49.890
Yeah.
Yeah.

1:08:50.125 --> 1:08:51.493
You too. I got to look out for
you, guys.

1:08:51.525 --> 1:08:51.992
Yeah. Yeah.

1:08:53.162 --> 1:08:54.628
I can't believe we got in.

1:08:54.729 --> 1:08:57.466
Yeah, man. Fuck that
bouncer. Here, take this.

1:08:57.498 --> 1:09:00.001
Oh, no. I'm good. I've had way
too much.

1:09:00.101 --> 1:09:01.737
Okay. One to grow on.

1:09:01.837 --> 1:09:02.404
Oh my God.

1:09:02.503 --> 1:09:07.274
Oh my God.

1:09:07.309 --> 1:09:09.011
Good news, I haven't seen
Maggie,

1:09:09.110 --> 1:09:10.912
- What?
- I haven't seen Maggie.

1:09:12.346 --> 1:09:14.382
Oh, dude. I said I have not. I
have not.

1:09:14.483 --> 1:09:15.551
But you brought her up, man.

1:09:15.650 --> 1:09:17.853
You've got to get her out of
your head.

1:09:21.122 --> 1:09:23.726
Where is your water polo team?

1:09:23.826 --> 1:09:25.426
Fuck the water polo team.

1:09:25.528 --> 1:09:27.128
Now, look at me.

1:09:27.162 --> 1:09:31.165
Tonight, you and I, we're making
new friends, okay?

1:09:31.198 --> 1:09:35.470
By new friends, I mean fucking
girls and by

1:09:35.503 --> 1:09:39.908
make I mean we're going to have
sex with them, man.

1:09:40.007 --> 1:09:41.510
Let's get outside the comfort
zone.

1:09:41.542 --> 1:09:44.179
Maggie is outside of my comfort
zone though.

1:09:44.212 --> 1:09:46.348
No. She's inside the comfort
zone.

1:09:46.381 --> 1:09:47.750
You're talking with her snugly.

1:09:47.983 --> 1:09:50.918
You were talking with her all
last night, weren't you?

1:09:51.019 --> 1:09:52.154
No, we don't need that.

1:09:52.186 --> 1:09:54.154
Look around you. Look at this.

1:09:54.189 --> 1:09:56.959
Look at the plethora of pussy.
Okay?

1:09:57.359 --> 1:09:59.527
Who do you got?
Who are you picking?

1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:03.197
Actually, I know that girl from
the other night.

1:10:03.231 --> 1:10:05.167
I'm talking to that girl.

1:10:05.199 --> 1:10:06.800
All right? Ready?

1:10:06.900 --> 1:10:13.774
Break!

1:10:13.875 --> 1:10:15.010
Julia.

1:10:15.042 --> 1:10:17.712
Alex from the softball game,
right?

1:10:17.746 --> 1:10:18.747
Yeah.

1:10:18.846 --> 1:10:21.615
Hi. I'm being antisocial here,
but my friends,

1:10:21.716 --> 1:10:23.018
Carolina and Garrett from
softball,

1:10:23.051 --> 1:10:24.419
actually, they're not here yet,

1:10:24.452 --> 1:10:26.889
so I just don't know what to do
with myself.

1:10:27.456 --> 1:10:29.891
I don't know what to do with
myself. I don't know.

1:10:29.923 --> 1:10:31.460
- That's ideal.
- Yes. Yeah.

1:10:32.060 --> 1:10:33.060
How's Maggie's leg?

1:10:33.095 --> 1:10:35.230
Oh, it's good.

1:10:35.262 --> 1:10:36.430
I think it's okay.

1:10:36.530 --> 1:10:39.067
I don't know.
That was a while ago.

1:10:39.100 --> 1:10:41.070
Yeah, you hit her super hard,

1:10:41.103 --> 1:10:43.137
but it was like she
barely felt it.

1:10:43.238 --> 1:10:46.240
I know, she's super tough.

1:10:46.274 --> 1:10:49.110
I mean ya'll are so cute
together.

1:10:49.211 --> 1:10:52.480
Oh, no, we're not together.

1:10:52.581 --> 1:10:56.118
We're not. We're just friends.
We're not friends.

1:10:56.217 --> 1:10:58.386
So who are you with tonight?

1:10:58.420 --> 1:11:03.692
I'm hoping you, Caroline, and
Garrett.

1:11:03.792 --> 1:11:06.227
Yeah.

1:11:06.261 --> 1:11:07.596
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:11:07.630 --> 1:11:10.163
No.

1:12:44.492 --> 1:12:46.195
Hey, get a room you two.

1:12:46.228 --> 1:12:47.930
Hey, what the fuck man?

1:12:48.029 --> 1:12:50.764
Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.

1:12:50.864 --> 1:12:56.103
I thought I thought
you two were my friends,

1:12:56.204 --> 1:12:58.439
and I was going to
try to be funny.

1:12:58.539 --> 1:13:01.141
I don't think your two friends
will find that funny at all.

1:13:01.509 --> 1:13:03.145
Yeah. That wasn't funny.

1:13:03.377 --> 1:13:05.146
Yeah. That wasn't funny at all.

1:13:05.346 --> 1:13:06.747
I'm sorry. That's my bad.

1:13:06.847 --> 1:13:09.184
It's cool. Who do you know from
the basketball team?

1:13:09.216 --> 1:13:11.152
- What's that?
- I said who do you know from the team here?

1:13:11.319 --> 1:13:18.160
Oh, I know Jay. Yeah.

1:13:19.694 --> 1:13:22.963
Yeah. I'm Jay.

1:13:23.163 --> 1:13:28.103
Yeah. You're literally talking
to Jay right now, dumb ass.

1:13:29.904 --> 1:13:36.044
What? I haven't seen you in so
long.

1:13:36.077 --> 1:13:37.412
Matt, get Charlie.

1:13:37.445 --> 1:13:39.413
Jay, it's me, Alex.

1:13:39.448 --> 1:13:40.715
Oh, you're the guy who's
leaving.

1:13:40.747 --> 1:13:43.184
That was a good one.

1:13:43.385 --> 1:13:45.386
- I'm going to give you that one.
- Let go.

1:13:45.420 --> 1:13:47.855
Let go, dude.

1:13:48.221 --> 1:13:51.960
Fucking freshman bouncer bitch.

1:13:52.060 --> 1:13:55.130
All right, man. Walk safe, man.
Get back to your dorm.

1:13:55.229 --> 1:13:56.397
All right, walk safe, man.

1:13:56.430 --> 1:14:00.167
Go back to your dorm.
That was you.

1:14:00.268 --> 1:14:01.502
How much playing time are you

1:14:01.601 --> 1:14:05.206
getting on the basketball team?

1:14:05.673 --> 1:14:08.277
I feel like it's not a time
because Coach probably

1:14:08.310 --> 1:14:12.347
thinks you're too small.

1:14:12.447 --> 1:14:14.248
Hey, have a good night. Have a
good night, bro.

1:14:14.282 --> 1:14:16.885
You know who you remind me of?
You remind me of one of those kids in

1:14:17.018 --> 1:14:18.619
high school whose parents would
always tell

1:14:18.653 --> 1:14:20.722
the Coach to play them more.

1:14:20.822 --> 1:14:21.456
Good one.

1:14:21.488 --> 1:14:22.690
That was you, huh?

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:24.125
You're killing it, tonight.

1:14:24.158 --> 1:14:25.460
This is my impression of you.

1:14:25.493 --> 1:14:27.863
I'm gonna do
an impression of you.

1:14:27.962 --> 1:14:31.599
Hey,
Coach, can I come into the game?

1:14:31.631 --> 1:14:34.301
I'll make sure the bench is
warm for Jay.

1:14:34.335 --> 1:14:36.270
What's that, Jay?

1:14:36.304 --> 1:14:37.239
You want me to
make sure that no one

1:14:37.439 --> 1:14:38.907
comes inside your party?

1:14:43.778 --> 1:14:45.447
That was good.

1:14:45.479 --> 1:14:47.515
Yeah.

1:14:48.615 --> 1:14:52.153
Do you want to again in ten it?

1:14:52.619 --> 1:14:55.323
Do I want to again in ten it?

1:14:55.356 --> 1:14:59.261
Yeah, like have sex again in
ten minutes.

1:15:23.385 --> 1:15:25.520
Hey.

1:15:25.552 --> 1:15:27.322
Oh, shit, what up?

1:15:27.355 --> 1:15:29.256
What the fuck?

1:15:29.356 --> 1:15:31.658
Dang, bro is this your room?

1:15:31.693 --> 1:15:33.094
No, is this not your room?

1:15:33.293 --> 1:15:37.297
Yeah, this is my room. Yeah,
this is my room. Get out.

1:15:37.532 --> 1:15:40.101
For sure bro. For sure.

1:15:41.203 --> 1:15:43.238
Oh, fuck.

1:15:43.337 --> 1:15:44.371
Are you guys like dating?

1:15:44.404 --> 1:15:45.873
- No.
- No, we're no.

1:15:46.274 --> 1:15:48.041
We're just like friends and I want
to talk to my friend in my room.

1:15:48.143 --> 1:15:50.045
So if you could just get out.
Get the fuck out.

1:15:50.145 --> 1:15:54.916
For sure bro. For sure man.
Jeez man.

1:15:54.948 --> 1:15:56.283
Get out.

1:15:56.384 --> 1:15:57.819
All right dude, jeez.

1:16:04.225 --> 1:16:05.427
What the fuck are you doing?

1:16:05.527 --> 1:16:06.761
What the fuck are doing?

1:16:06.862 --> 1:16:08.563
You've just fucked
this dude in here?

1:16:08.595 --> 1:16:09.764
That's none of your business.

1:16:09.797 --> 1:16:11.565
I'm going to leave and if you
follow me,

1:16:11.599 --> 1:16:13.935
I'm going to kick your ass.
I'm serious.

1:16:13.967 --> 1:16:15.302
What?

1:16:15.404 --> 1:16:16.538
Don't follow me.

1:16:16.570 --> 1:16:17.972
Maggie, what's
going on right now?

1:16:18.073 --> 1:16:19.106
Nothing is going on.

1:16:19.140 --> 1:16:21.409
I thought you and I were having
a thing outside.

1:16:21.442 --> 1:16:24.145
I was like crushing college in
there.

1:16:24.345 --> 1:16:27.181
Oh my god. Okay. Yes, you seem
like you were having fun.

1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:28.282
What do you want to say, dude?

1:16:28.382 --> 1:16:29.650
Like congrats on crushing
college?

1:16:29.751 --> 1:16:31.586
No, I was just like
doing that for you.

1:16:31.618 --> 1:16:33.755
- What?
- Like I was putting on a show for you.

1:16:33.854 --> 1:16:35.222
I was like trying to get your
attention.

1:16:35.256 --> 1:16:37.192
Don't do that. I don't want you
to do that.

1:16:37.292 --> 1:16:38.760
That doesn't make any sense.

1:16:38.792 --> 1:16:42.262
You got me a drink and you told
to keep ramping up.

1:16:42.296 --> 1:16:43.497
You were flirting with me.

1:16:43.597 --> 1:16:45.099
We were making eye contact.

1:16:45.199 --> 1:16:47.201
We were having a peak moment
and you just fucking

1:16:47.301 --> 1:16:48.636
disappeared to like fuck a dude.

1:16:48.735 --> 1:16:50.137
Okay. You we're having a peak
moment.

1:16:50.238 --> 1:16:52.106
I was just at a fucking party
and I brought

1:16:52.207 --> 1:16:54.809
you a drink and then I went
back to what I was doing.

1:16:54.908 --> 1:16:58.179
Why do you want to just go back
to what you were doing?

1:16:58.279 --> 1:16:59.648
What do you mean?

1:16:59.747 --> 1:17:02.015
Why are you acting like last
night didn't fucking happen?

1:17:02.115 --> 1:17:04.118
Why were you so mean to me
today at the store?

1:17:04.219 --> 1:17:06.253
Why did you introduce me to
your fucking friends?

1:17:06.287 --> 1:17:08.689
Why did save like 9,000 fucking
Instagram messages?

1:17:08.789 --> 1:17:10.658
Why are you acting like a
creepy fucking psycho?

1:17:10.759 --> 1:17:12.594
Because I like you.

1:17:12.627 --> 1:17:13.995
I like you a lot.

1:17:14.095 --> 1:17:16.398
I had a really good
night with you.

1:17:16.631 --> 1:17:19.534
And I want to continue
to talk to you.

1:17:19.634 --> 1:17:21.101
Like did you not have a good
night last night?

1:17:21.135 --> 1:17:22.403
I did. I had a great
night last night.

1:17:22.603 --> 1:17:24.640
Now, I'm trying to have another
great night.

1:17:24.939 --> 1:17:26.608
What?

1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:29.277
- What?
- Oh my god, dude. You're so mean.

1:17:29.476 --> 1:17:31.645
You're so mean. You're awful.

1:17:31.679 --> 1:17:33.547
- I'm awful?
- Yes.

1:17:33.648 --> 1:17:34.614
What? Oh, my god. Did you think
we were going to

1:17:34.649 --> 1:17:37.352
date because of one night?

1:17:37.452 --> 1:17:38.418
No.

1:17:38.618 --> 1:17:40.054
I don't want to wake up and get

1:17:40.154 --> 1:17:42.423
breakfast burritos with you
dude. I don't want that.

1:17:42.623 --> 1:17:44.425
Yeah. You've made that
abundantly clear.

1:17:44.626 --> 1:17:48.429
But I care about you
after last night.

1:17:48.628 --> 1:17:50.498
I care about you after last
night and you

1:17:50.532 --> 1:17:52.167
can't just pretend
like I don't exist.

1:17:52.266 --> 1:17:53.833
Actually, I can do anything
that I want.

1:17:53.868 --> 1:17:55.103
I don't owe you anything.

1:17:55.203 --> 1:17:56.338
I don't owe you a text,

1:17:56.371 --> 1:17:57.639
about like, oh, hey, I had a
great night last night.

1:17:57.671 --> 1:17:59.106
- Maggie stop.
- What?

1:17:59.140 --> 1:18:00.141
- Stop.
- What?

1:18:00.341 --> 1:18:01.609
Just like talk to me,
please. Just like talk to me.

1:18:01.643 --> 1:18:02.743
I'm talking to you.

1:18:02.844 --> 1:18:04.045
But it feels like you're not.
Just come

1:18:04.078 --> 1:18:06.014
outside of yourself for two
fucking seconds.

1:18:06.046 --> 1:18:08.282
Care about somebody other than
yourself for two seconds.

1:18:08.382 --> 1:18:09.451
You need to grow up.

1:18:09.484 --> 1:18:10.451
Why is that so fucking hard for
you?

1:18:10.650 --> 1:18:11.786
You need to grow the fuck up.

1:18:11.886 --> 1:18:12.553
No, you need to grow up. You
need to grow.

1:18:12.587 --> 1:18:14.021
I am. I've been.

1:18:14.055 --> 1:18:17.192
Your like the girl from 13
going on 30.

1:18:19.461 --> 1:18:21.195
Jennifer Garner?

1:18:21.296 --> 1:18:22.998
No, I'm talking about the movie
13 going on 30.

1:18:23.030 --> 1:18:24.698
There's like the girl would
like the little house.

1:18:24.731 --> 1:18:26.033
Yeah. That's Jennifer Garner.

1:18:26.068 --> 1:18:28.269
You're talking about Jennifer
Garner right now?

1:18:28.368 --> 1:18:29.837
She was awesome in that movie.

1:18:29.871 --> 1:18:31.206
What are you talking about?

1:18:31.305 --> 1:18:32.806
Okay. I'm just trying to stay
like the premise of

1:18:32.841 --> 1:18:34.142
that movie is that there's this
13-year-old girl.

1:18:34.242 --> 1:18:35.143
Friends.

1:18:35.243 --> 1:18:37.212
Hi, this is my room, man. Can
you leave?

1:18:37.244 --> 1:18:39.713
Oh my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

1:18:39.747 --> 1:18:41.214
I'm so sorry.

1:18:41.248 --> 1:18:43.484
I'm gonna take off.

1:18:48.722 --> 1:18:49.689
What?

1:18:49.724 --> 1:18:51.726
I see what you're doing.

1:18:51.760 --> 1:18:53.061
What's going on?

1:18:53.094 --> 1:18:57.498
You're fucking crazy.
This is my room.

1:19:01.601 --> 1:19:04.738
I'm high but I'm not
that high.

1:19:04.771 --> 1:19:07.140
What are you talking about?
I wanna laugh.

1:19:07.242 --> 1:19:08.876
I was saying you

1:19:08.908 --> 1:19:10.744
are like the girl Jenny whoever
was playing.

1:19:10.778 --> 1:19:11.880
It's Jennifer Garner.

1:19:11.912 --> 1:19:13.413
- Okay.
- Jennifer Garner, is her name.

1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:14.815
Okay. The girl that made a wish
that

1:19:14.916 --> 1:19:16.016
she could be older and then

1:19:16.117 --> 1:19:17.318
she woke up with a body of a 30
year old.

1:19:17.350 --> 1:19:18.452
But you she didn't know how to
be an adult

1:19:18.485 --> 1:19:19.753
because she was actually 13.

1:19:19.787 --> 1:19:21.389
I know the plot, Maggie, I'm
aware of the plot.

1:19:21.421 --> 1:19:24.125
I'm trying to say, you are not
actually 13.

1:19:24.225 --> 1:19:25.626
You don't get to just
turn back into

1:19:25.725 --> 1:19:26.795
a teenager when you need a hug

1:19:26.828 --> 1:19:28.496
from your mom to get through
the day.

1:19:28.595 --> 1:19:29.996
You have to just be an adult.

1:19:30.097 --> 1:19:31.431
There's nothing wrong with
getting

1:19:31.465 --> 1:19:33.434
hugs to get you through the day.

1:19:33.466 --> 1:19:35.569
I feel like you're going to cry.

1:19:35.603 --> 1:19:36.671
Are you're going to cry right
now we at the backyard of

1:19:36.770 --> 1:19:38.105
a fucking college wig party?

1:19:38.140 --> 1:19:40.508
There's nothing wrong with that
If I was going to.

1:19:40.608 --> 1:19:41.641
There's something wrong with
that.

1:19:41.676 --> 1:19:43.044
It means that you
need to grow up.

1:19:43.077 --> 1:19:44.244
No, you know what it means? It
means my parents were

1:19:44.345 --> 1:19:45.680
good parents who gave me love
and attention.

1:19:45.779 --> 1:19:47.181
Unlike you're miserable,
horrible parents

1:19:47.282 --> 1:19:48.983
who fucked you up so bad you
have to

1:19:49.082 --> 1:19:50.951
have sex with random guys to
make you feel

1:19:50.984 --> 1:19:53.487
good and wanted and in control.

1:19:53.587 --> 1:19:58.092
Okay. Have fun with

1:19:58.126 --> 1:19:59.527
your stuffed animals tonight
your parents

1:19:59.627 --> 1:20:00.928
did a kick-ass job dude.

1:20:00.961 --> 1:20:02.762
You know what I like my life,

1:20:02.796 --> 1:20:04.097
and I liked it before last
night.

1:20:04.198 --> 1:20:05.833
Just because you feel like
fucking shit about yours,

1:20:05.932 --> 1:20:06.934
doesn't mean that you've get to
make me feel

1:20:06.967 --> 1:20:08.635
bad about who I am, okay?

1:20:08.670 --> 1:20:10.905
Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

1:23:27.268 --> 1:23:29.502
Hey, did you or did you

1:23:29.603 --> 1:23:32.106
go outside of your comfort zone
last night?

1:23:33.974 --> 1:23:40.381
Oh, I don't know
if I remember it.

1:23:40.481 --> 1:23:45.086
Wait. Well, I'm trying to get
back at my brain.

1:23:45.185 --> 1:23:49.090
Did we walk home last night?

1:23:49.189 --> 1:23:52.625
No. No, we didn't.

1:23:52.725 --> 1:23:54.027
But I came back in and you were

1:23:54.127 --> 1:23:56.797
asleep and then I went over and
I put you on your side.

1:23:56.997 --> 1:23:59.000
I remember you were like,

1:23:59.033 --> 1:24:00.802
"I'm not cuddling bitch ass."

1:24:01.002 --> 1:24:02.270
I was like, "No one said you
were."

1:24:02.369 --> 1:24:03.871
Yeah. I don't remember that.

1:24:03.904 --> 1:24:07.875
I don't. I don't remember
anything.

1:24:07.908 --> 1:24:10.911
Jesus Christ, that's so scary.

1:24:11.412 --> 1:24:15.216
I honestly kinda feel a
little bit responsible.

1:24:15.250 --> 1:24:15.983
Why?

1:24:16.015 --> 1:24:17.217
I just didn't say anything after

1:24:17.251 --> 1:24:19.587
you probably took 12 shots.

1:24:19.621 --> 1:24:20.855
12? 12 shots?

1:24:20.889 --> 1:24:21.956
Yeah. I remember you kept
taking,

1:24:22.055 --> 1:24:23.390
you take one shot
and then you take

1:24:23.423 --> 1:24:25.292
another and be like,
"I want to grow on."

1:24:25.391 --> 1:24:28.829
Oh, yeah. Like an extra
birthday candle.

1:24:28.863 --> 1:24:31.966
Yeah. Except it ended up being
like six to grow on.

1:24:32.067 --> 1:24:33.766
God, damn it. I've got to stop
drinking so much.

1:24:33.868 --> 1:24:37.038
What day is it?

1:24:37.070 --> 1:24:38.738
What day? It's Sunday.

1:24:38.771 --> 1:24:45.078
Sunday. God. Well, TGI Sunday

1:24:45.113 --> 1:24:52.353
because this motherfucker is an
alcoholic. Okay.

1:24:54.055 --> 1:24:57.057
Yeah, I'm down for a chill
Sunday.

1:24:57.091 --> 1:24:59.127
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1:24:59.426 --> 1:25:02.395
Do you want to maybe clean up
the room a little bit too?

1:25:02.430 --> 1:25:06.900
Yeah. This place is a
fucking mess.

1:25:06.934 --> 1:25:07.868
Yeah.

1:25:08.101 --> 1:25:09.203
- Let's get to it.
- Let's do it.

1:25:09.436 --> 1:25:10.604
Yeah.

1:25:10.637 --> 1:25:12.806
You're going to throw up?
You're going to throw up?

1:25:12.907 --> 1:25:16.077
I got you. I got you.

1:25:16.109 --> 1:25:17.443
Here we go.
Here we go.

1:25:26.686 --> 1:25:28.256
I don't think I'm going to be
able to

1:25:28.288 --> 1:25:29.322
help you clean up, man.

1:25:29.355 --> 1:25:30.224
- Absolutely.
- No.

1:25:30.323 --> 1:25:31.891
- You stay in bed.
- Yeah.

1:25:32.024 --> 1:25:33.795
I'm going to get you some water.

1:25:34.295 --> 1:25:35.663
That would be great.

1:25:35.762 --> 1:25:37.064
I'll get you some and I'll put
some in a red soda cups.

1:25:37.096 --> 1:25:38.832
All right, that will be fire.
Yeah.

1:25:43.136 --> 1:25:44.671
- Thank you.
- Yup.

1:26:11.097 --> 1:26:12.934
Get off.

1:26:17.904 --> 1:26:19.139
Clearly.

1:26:22.475 --> 1:26:24.612
Maybe we could give
it to a new turtle.

1:26:27.213 --> 1:26:28.283
Look at you.

1:27:11.326 --> 1:27:12.493
I'm drowning.

1:27:14.194 --> 1:27:16.296
Okay. I'm hungry.

1:27:16.395 --> 1:27:17.297
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

1:27:17.331 --> 1:27:19.000
Oh, my God.

1:27:59.105 --> 1:28:00.206
Alex, dude.

1:28:00.239 --> 1:28:01.274
- Garrett.
- We lost you last night.

1:28:01.408 --> 1:28:02.677
Yeah, I know, but

1:28:02.777 --> 1:28:05.244
the craziest thing happened.
It was, yeah.

1:28:05.279 --> 1:28:06.680
Are you eating here?

1:28:06.779 --> 1:28:09.048
No. Well, I mean,

1:28:09.283 --> 1:28:11.452
I wasn't planning
on eating here.

1:28:11.484 --> 1:28:12.786
I was planning to get it to go,

1:28:12.819 --> 1:28:14.287
but I have time to eat

1:28:14.322 --> 1:28:16.056
here if you want to eat
together, I have time.

1:28:16.289 --> 1:28:17.358
If that's what you're asking.
I'm not

1:28:17.457 --> 1:28:18.625
sure if that's what you're
insinuating.

1:28:18.659 --> 1:28:19.492
Alex, my dude.

1:28:19.592 --> 1:28:21.061
- Yeah.
- Sorry. I'll have the mushroom.

1:28:21.328 --> 1:28:22.429
I'm already making it.
You were

1:28:22.462 --> 1:28:23.831
sitting there talking for an
hour.

1:28:25.099 --> 1:28:26.667
For here or to go?

1:28:27.001 --> 1:28:31.072
For here. Thank you.

1:28:32.171 --> 1:28:33.673
Definitely pretty.

1:28:33.774 --> 1:28:35.242
- No way,
- Definitely pretty.

1:28:35.275 --> 1:28:36.077
Absolutely not.

1:28:36.277 --> 1:28:37.144
Hey.

1:28:37.377 --> 1:28:38.478
Hey. It's the guy who ditched
us.

1:28:38.511 --> 1:28:40.313
Yeah. What happened?
Where were you?

1:28:40.346 --> 1:28:41.481
Okay. What the hell is going

1:28:41.515 --> 1:28:42.816
on? I don't understand why-

1:28:42.917 --> 1:28:44.986
I'm not friends with anybody
named Josh or Emily.

1:28:45.019 --> 1:28:46.052
Wait, what?

1:28:46.087 --> 1:28:47.455
Emily and Josh have never
existed.

1:28:47.555 --> 1:28:50.291
I've never been friends with
anybody named Josh or Emily.

1:28:50.323 --> 1:28:51.557
Every time I've brought them up,

1:28:51.658 --> 1:28:53.227
I've just been talking a lie-

1:28:53.260 --> 1:28:55.096
I'm going to fucking combust here.
I'm getting you on a plane.

1:28:55.796 --> 1:28:56.729
No, mom. Mom.

1:28:56.829 --> 1:28:59.667
Yeah. We're going to use Uncle
Tibs miles.

1:28:59.699 --> 1:29:00.835
No, mom.

1:29:00.935 --> 1:29:02.002
Listen. I didn't say that to
make you.

1:29:02.101 --> 1:29:03.203
Why would you want us before?

1:29:03.304 --> 1:29:04.538
Because you were going to tell
me to come

1:29:04.572 --> 1:29:05.639
home and I probably would have
just come home.

1:29:05.671 --> 1:29:06.907
There's nothing wrong with that.

1:29:07.140 --> 1:29:08.574
Yes, there would have been
something wrong with that.

1:29:08.675 --> 1:29:10.144
Why? Why can't you? Why? Why?

1:29:10.176 --> 1:29:11.344
Mom, I can't just come home.

1:29:11.377 --> 1:29:13.648
Yes you can. You actually can.
It's fine.

1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:15.515
But I don't want to do that.

1:29:15.550 --> 1:29:17.016
I want to stay here.

1:29:17.051 --> 1:29:19.486
I don't want to come home.

1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:21.188
At least I want to try to

1:29:21.221 --> 1:29:23.123
stay here.
I haven't been trying.

1:29:24.358 --> 1:29:27.128
That group of friends that I
met on Friday,

1:29:27.328 --> 1:29:28.996
they invited me to sit the
marketplace with

1:29:29.029 --> 1:29:31.598
them and I realized as I sat
down with them,

1:29:31.698 --> 1:29:33.534
that I probably sat down at the
marketplace

1:29:33.567 --> 1:29:35.703
a total of 20 times since I've
been here.

1:29:35.735 --> 1:29:37.704
This whole time I've been at
the marketplace,

1:29:37.738 --> 1:29:39.373
I have sat down at the
marketplace 20 times

1:29:39.405 --> 1:29:41.207
because I usually just do this
thing where

1:29:41.242 --> 1:29:43.211
I take a to go container and
just

1:29:43.243 --> 1:29:45.679
go back to my dorm room and eat
by myself.

1:29:45.712 --> 1:29:51.885
What I've realized is that I
haven't fully been here.

1:29:52.685 --> 1:29:56.456
Like, I have,
but I've also been-

1:29:56.556 --> 1:29:57.791
Kind of still been here too?

1:29:57.824 --> 1:30:03.229
Yeah. That's why I was going to
call you guys

1:30:03.264 --> 1:30:04.698
because I just wanted to say
that

1:30:04.730 --> 1:30:10.170
that I love you
guys so much.

1:30:12.606 --> 1:30:16.176
I love you so much and I miss
you guys so much.

1:30:16.409 --> 1:30:18.912
I miss you guys so much.

1:30:21.114 --> 1:30:23.483
And I think I've

1:30:23.583 --> 1:30:25.819
been feeling paralyzed here
because of

1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:30.190
that and also because

1:30:30.390 --> 1:30:32.192
nobody here is half as

1:30:32.393 --> 1:30:35.962
cool and half as loving as you
guys are.

1:30:36.063 --> 1:30:40.000
But even though I'm feeling
really sad right this second,

1:30:40.100 --> 1:30:41.468
an hour ago I was feeling really

1:30:41.568 --> 1:30:43.270
really good and I was feeling
really

1:30:43.302 --> 1:30:46.305
optimistic because I really

1:30:46.405 --> 1:30:48.609
think if I start trying to throw

1:30:48.641 --> 1:30:54.215
myself in to college and start
trying to fully dive in,

1:30:54.448 --> 1:30:59.153
I think I can start having a
better time and

1:30:59.252 --> 1:31:01.654
maybe I can meet people who are
half as

1:31:01.755 --> 1:31:05.960
cool and half as loving as you
guys are.

1:31:06.592 --> 1:31:08.895
Well, maybe that does mean that

1:31:17.904 --> 1:31:20.107
I was going to say that maybe
that doesn't

1:31:20.140 --> 1:31:23.577
mean that I shouldn't call as
much anymore.

1:31:27.247 --> 1:31:34.354
Yeah, honey. I think that's
really smart, honey.

1:31:34.454 --> 1:31:41.662
I mean, it's not healthy to
check in so often.

1:31:42.195 --> 1:31:44.931
Yeah.

1:31:45.032 --> 1:31:47.534
Yeah.

1:31:47.635 --> 1:31:51.505
Yeah. We'll be here,

1:31:51.537 --> 1:31:53.740
we'll always be here, honey.

1:31:53.841 --> 1:31:57.011
We'll always be here whenever
you call or pick up,

1:31:57.110 --> 1:32:02.315
but you should save all your
energy for all your friends

1:32:02.350 --> 1:32:04.785
and the parties and

1:32:04.885 --> 1:32:05.920
studying and

1:32:06.020 --> 1:32:08.222
all the adventures you're going
to have there.

1:32:17.497 --> 1:32:19.232
I'm really sorry, honey.

1:32:19.332 --> 1:32:21.534
It's okay. It's okay.

1:32:21.568 --> 1:32:25.972
It's okay. I'm really sorry too.

1:32:55.069 --> 1:32:56.804
You can help me.

1:33:00.707 --> 1:33:04.078
Could you give me these rocks?

1:33:04.444 --> 1:33:06.380
No.

1:33:06.412 --> 1:33:08.414
Can I? They are really pretty.

1:33:08.448 --> 1:33:09.350
Sure.

1:34:38.805 --> 1:34:40.239
Good.

1:34:40.439 --> 1:34:43.576
We have to make sure you go to
the shower to wash that.

1:34:43.676 --> 1:34:45.679
Yeah, can somebody
do my make-up for it?

1:34:45.712 --> 1:34:46.746
Okay. Give me one second.

1:34:46.846 --> 1:34:49.250
Yeah. Can you give me a tiger
stripe?

1:34:49.449 --> 1:34:51.417
If we give you a tiger stripe
it's going to fade.

1:34:51.518 --> 1:34:55.789
Yeah.

1:35:15.975 --> 1:35:18.478
What? Stop. You said the same
thing last year.

1:35:18.712 --> 1:35:19.746
You liked it more that I did
last year?

1:35:19.845 --> 1:35:22.081
- Yeah, I know.
- He did. She's amazing.

1:35:22.548 --> 1:35:23.484
We're agreeing with you.

1:35:23.716 --> 1:35:24.451
Agreed.

1:35:24.484 --> 1:35:25.686
She's really good.

1:35:25.719 --> 1:35:29.322
She's like, "Do you know Meryl
Streep?"

1:35:29.355 --> 1:35:34.161
Just what it was like to have
been very young.

1:35:34.728 --> 1:35:39.867
Particularly the days when

1:35:39.899 --> 1:35:42.068
you were in love for the first
time,

1:35:42.103 --> 1:35:47.373
when you felt like a person
sleepwalking and you

1:35:47.408 --> 1:35:50.277
didn't quite see the street
that you were in and

1:35:50.377 --> 1:35:54.481
you didn't quite hear
everything that was said to you.

1:35:54.814 --> 1:35:57.617
You're just a little bit crazy.

1:35:57.717 --> 1:36:01.654
So will you remember that,
please?

1:36:01.755 --> 1:36:03.155
Can you guys' take my sister?
Is that okay?

1:36:03.256 --> 1:36:04.924
- Yes.
- No. Just skip the test.

1:36:05.024 --> 1:36:06.393
It is going to be fine.

1:36:06.426 --> 1:36:08.395
No. I know. It's just my last
one, so I want to do.

1:36:08.494 --> 1:36:10.497
Well, you have a full face make up on
in this outfit. What are you wearing?

1:36:10.630 --> 1:36:11.797
I can take my
make-up off and change.

1:36:11.899 --> 1:36:12.900
Are you about to go to the
library?

1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.368
- Yeah.
- To study for your finals?

1:36:14.635 --> 1:36:15.534
- Yeah.
- So am I.

1:36:16.002 --> 1:36:17.371
Do you wanna work together?

1:36:17.470 --> 1:36:18.570
Yeah.

1:36:18.604 --> 1:36:19.872
- Cool.
- That's interesting.

1:36:20.140 --> 1:36:21.008
Let's go.

1:36:21.041 --> 1:36:23.978
What's going on? Why are you
talking?

1:36:24.078 --> 1:36:25.245
Well, you're only going to

1:36:25.278 --> 1:36:26.212
library because she's
going to library.

1:36:26.313 --> 1:36:26.814
That's not true.

1:36:26.913 --> 1:36:27.715
I think it is true.

1:36:27.814 --> 1:36:29.248
I was going to the library

1:36:29.282 --> 1:36:31.051
to study because I have a final
tomorrow.

1:36:31.150 --> 1:36:32.152
Which final?

1:36:32.185 --> 1:36:33.387
History.

1:36:33.487 --> 1:36:35.055
- History?
- Of?

1:36:35.421 --> 1:36:36.689
What?

1:36:36.789 --> 1:36:38.458
History of?

1:36:38.492 --> 1:36:40.961
The 18th century paint.

1:36:40.993 --> 1:36:45.465
Paint?
What did you just say?

1:36:46.466 --> 1:36:50.170
How are you so talented?

1:36:50.871 --> 1:36:52.672
What did you really think of
the show?

1:36:52.771 --> 1:36:54.807
I really loved it so much and I

1:36:54.841 --> 1:36:57.778
really think you're the best
actor of all time.

1:36:57.810 --> 1:36:59.179
- Okay.
- I'm not kidding.

1:36:59.479 --> 1:37:01.581
Thank you.

1:37:02.448 --> 1:37:05.786
Are you going to be in L.A.
this summer.

1:37:05.819 --> 1:37:08.255
I've got a ton of studying.

1:37:08.354 --> 1:37:10.356
Fuck you.

1:37:10.390 --> 1:37:12.693
I haven't decided yet.

1:37:12.792 --> 1:37:14.661
School year ends in a week.

1:37:14.694 --> 1:37:17.029
Yeah, I know. I can

1:37:17.130 --> 1:37:20.201
sleep on Garret's
couch when I go to Chicago.

1:37:21.100 --> 1:37:23.869
No. You got to decide.

1:37:23.970 --> 1:37:26.573
Get out of here.

1:37:32.712 --> 1:37:35.850
Alex, if I said I wanted to

1:37:35.882 --> 1:37:39.519
date you and be your
girlfriend, would you stay here?

1:37:45.358 --> 1:37:46.560
Yeah.

1:37:48.161 --> 1:37:50.597
Really?

1:37:51.564 --> 1:37:54.166
Yeah, Maggie.

1:37:54.199 --> 1:37:56.869
I want to be your girlfriend.

1:37:56.903 --> 1:37:59.606
You really want that?

1:37:59.707 --> 1:38:02.108
I really want that.

1:38:02.208 --> 1:38:06.880
You're trying to date me?

1:38:06.912 --> 1:38:09.115
I'm not trying to marry you.

1:38:15.654 --> 1:38:20.226
Okay. Well, I understand you're
not wanting to marry me.

1:38:20.260 --> 1:38:23.597
I won't make it that important
now.

1:38:27.667 --> 1:38:34.274
But I'm not down with you being
a shitty partner.

1:38:37.877 --> 1:38:38.679
I don't-

1:38:39.779 --> 1:38:41.915
I'm not saying we have to spend

1:38:41.948 --> 1:38:42.816
all our time together and I'm

1:38:42.916 --> 1:38:43.917
not saying that we have to be

1:38:44.016 --> 1:38:45.318
there for each other all the
time,

1:38:45.417 --> 1:38:51.324
but I do want it to feel like
we're on the same team.

1:38:53.661 --> 1:38:56.962
I do want it to feel we have
each other's backs.

1:38:57.063 --> 1:38:58.699
Looking out for each other?

1:38:58.931 --> 1:39:00.701
Yeah.

1:39:30.997 --> 1:39:32.199
You tryin' to date me?

1:39:32.832 --> 1:39:36.069
What? That was crazy.

1:40:09.970 --> 1:40:11.003
All right.
Are you ready?

1:40:11.037 --> 1:40:12.638
Okay, I'm ready.

1:40:12.872 --> 1:40:16.143
We want a batter not
a broken arm.

1:40:16.176 --> 1:40:17.711
Throw the ball, Chuck!

1:40:17.810 --> 1:40:18.778
All right, here it comes.

1:40:23.082 --> 1:40:28.789
Oh, my gosh, it's goin'.

1:40:29.256 --> 1:40:31.925
It's goin'. It's gone!

1:40:32.125 --> 1:40:34.494
Oh, my God. It's a home run!
