00:36.954 --> 00:38.160
Why do we dream?

00:46.881 --> 00:49.338
Perhaps we’d be better
off not looking at all.

00:50.927 --> 00:53.919
Not delving,
not yearning.

00:57.642 --> 00:59.382
But that’s not human nature.

00:59.769 --> 01:01.885
Not the human heart.

That is not why we are here.

to make a difference,

16:04.047 --> 16:06.504
Claire, are you okay?

16:06.591 --> 16:09.628
Yeah, I'm just trying
to get away from
these people.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.255
No. No.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.299
You’re better off
going with them.

16:14.516 --> 16:15.631
She’s right.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.181
You shouldn't be here,

16:18.228 --> 16:20.435
but as soon as you're
safe out of the city,

16:21.273 --> 16:23.764
you try and get away.
Do you understand?

16:25.861 --> 16:26.850
Yeah.

16:28.697 --> 16:31.814
I need to find Peter.
Where is he?

16:32.409 --> 16:33.740
I don't know.
They won't tell me.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.317
That's long enough, dear.

16:38.623 --> 16:41.956
Tell me you have
a plan, Dad.

16:42.043 --> 16:43.419
I have a plan.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.495
I love you, Claire.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.001
I love you, too.

16:53.597 --> 16:56.339
We have a new priority.
Peter Petrelli,
we have to find him.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.845
What for?
We know where Sylar is.
We can go after him.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.675
No, not without Petrelli.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.635
He's the only one
who can stop him.

17:04.065 --> 17:06.522
I've come 3,000 miles.
I left my pregnant
wife at home.

17:06.610 --> 17:09.101
He's a bad guy. I'm a cop.
I'm going after him.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.444
Then he will kill you.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.608
(CHUCKLES)

17:53.406 --> 17:54.737
Here you are, sir.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.200
Thank you.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.747
Hi.
Hi.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.496
I'm Peter.
I'm your father's new nurse.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.169
Yes, I've heard.
I'm Simone Deveaux.

18:10.548 --> 18:11.754
Nice to meet you.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.923
Your mother seems to know
my father somehow.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.716
Yeah, she's...

18:16.763 --> 18:18.003
She's...

18:18.640 --> 18:20.346
Sorry.

18:21.601 --> 18:25.435
Yeah, my mother,
she's full of surprises.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.139
I wanna thank you.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.020
I know
it's a real hard job.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.191
Dying's hard.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.693
What I do, it's just...

18:36.366 --> 18:37.355
I'm here to help.

18:37.450 --> 18:41.659
No, you're a real hero
to care for a perfect
stranger like this.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.657
This may sound strange,

18:44.291 --> 18:47.579
but your father's last
few weeks, his death,

18:49.379 --> 18:51.745
it could be beautiful
if you let it be.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.205
Sure, piece of cake.

18:54.009 --> 18:56.250
I'm not saying
it's not tragic for you.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.042
I'm just saying...

18:59.389 --> 19:02.347
You know,
death is the one thing
that connects us all,

19:02.434 --> 19:06.393
reminds us that
what's really important
is who we've touched,

19:07.230 --> 19:09.391
and you know,
how much we've given.

19:10.317 --> 19:15.232
It makes us realize
that we have to be
good to one another.

19:17.073 --> 19:21.817
See, your father,
he's the real hero,
not me.

19:27.584 --> 19:31.327
Come on, I'll show
you the apartment,
get you settled in.

19:32.922 --> 19:36.050
CHARLES: Believe me,
if he knew, you'd know.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.750
There's a look
you just can't hide
when it first shows.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.302
What about Nathan?

19:41.389 --> 19:44.426
Linderman tells me
Nathan will be ready
to play his part.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.803
Well, he's been
wrong before.

19:46.895 --> 19:48.681
Meaning what, exactly?

19:48.772 --> 19:51.514
I think that Linderman is
betting on the wrong brother.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.439
We talking about
the same Peter, here?

19:53.526 --> 19:56.268
I look in Peter's eyes,
I see compassion, empathy,

19:56.363 --> 19:59.355
but, most of all,
I see hope.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.440
This war won't be
saved on strength.

20:01.534 --> 20:05.493
What it really needs is
heart, and that's Peter.

20:05.622 --> 20:06.577
Charles, don't get me wrong.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.906
I love Peter,
but that poor kid can barely
get out of his own way.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.992
He's ruled by insecurities.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.201
He's weak.

20:14.923 --> 20:18.290
No, trust me,
this bomb is going
to go off,

20:20.470 --> 20:23.758
and Nathan is going
to be the one
the world turns to.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.383
I don't believe
this tragedy's inevitable.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.810
Well, then, one of us
is going to be right

20:31.940 --> 20:33.225
and one of us won't.

20:33.316 --> 20:36.433
Well, I'm glad
I won't be alive to see
which one that is.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.481
You are in
my prayers, Charles.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.275
I could use them.

20:42.367 --> 20:46.610
Goodbye, my dear,
dear friend.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.877
I know you're there, Peter.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.331
(GASPS)

21:46.639 --> 21:47.890
(GRUNTS)

21:50.560 --> 21:51.800
(GROANS)

21:54.272 --> 21:55.887
SYLAR: Looks like
you dropped something.

22:00.278 --> 22:03.315
(CHOKING)

22:04.240 --> 22:06.322
SYLAR: Comic book
that predicts the future.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.196
What will they think of next?

22:11.581 --> 22:13.117
You're kidding?

22:13.208 --> 22:14.869
This is how Isaac
thought I'd die,

22:14.959 --> 22:17.075
stabbed
by a silly little man?

22:17.962 --> 22:19.293
Hiro is not silly.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.996
You should have seen
the look on his face
when he tried to kill me.

22:22.091 --> 22:24.002
You cannot take my brain.

22:24.093 --> 22:28.132
Please, what would
I want with your brain?

22:30.517 --> 22:31.848
Where is Peter Petrelli?

22:31.935 --> 22:33.641
I don't know.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.389
(SCREAMS)

22:39.275 --> 22:41.266
Where is he?

22:44.614 --> 22:46.400
Let him go.

22:47.951 --> 22:49.691
I don't think
I'm going to.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.026
ANDO: Hiro.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.247
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

22:53.331 --> 22:57.415
All you have to do
is stop time before
I cut off his head.

22:58.962 --> 23:01.920
Do you think you can
do your little
before I can do mine?

23:02.382 --> 23:04.839
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

23:18.439 --> 23:19.690
N/K/.' Micah!

23:22.986 --> 23:24.772
Where are you?

23:25.113 --> 23:26.569
Micah!

23:40.211 --> 23:41.326
How...

23:45.091 --> 23:46.206
NIKI: You can't be here.

23:46.301 --> 23:47.507
Look what you did.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.684
Oh, my God. Micah.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.272
It's all your fault,
Niki.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.934
D.L., now Micah.

24:03.026 --> 24:07.110
They're both gone,
because you were weak.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.606
Micah, please.

24:08.698 --> 24:11.690
The wrong sister died.
It should have been you.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.696
Face it, Niki,
you're nothing.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.783
I'm the one they needed.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.322
(GRUNTS)

24:20.293 --> 24:21.282
(CHUCKLES)

25:12.762 --> 25:15.344
Molly, we need to go, now.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.682
Where are we going?

25:16.766 --> 25:19.883
Officer Parkman called.
He believes that Sylar...

25:19.977 --> 25:22.639
He believes
the boogeyman is
on his way.

25:23.940 --> 25:27.478
No, he's not on his way.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.108
He's already here.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.486
NATHAN: I have to get
some paperwork.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.237
I'm not going
to be coming back
to my office.

25:37.328 --> 25:39.865
Helicopter's picking
us up from the roof
in 10 minutes.

25:39.956 --> 25:42.948
When the jet lands
tomorrow morning,
you'll be safe.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.748
But everyone
else will be dead.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.086
How can you do
nothing to stop this?

25:56.180 --> 25:57.386
It's inevitable, dear.

25:57.473 --> 25:59.384
There's nothing
anyone can do about it.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.056
Thatsinsane!

26:01.144 --> 26:04.477
Nothing is inevitable.
The future is not
written in stone.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.728
I'm afraid this one is.

26:09.819 --> 26:10.899
If everything is
so inevitable,

26:10.987 --> 26:14.104
then why has she
been trying to keep us
apart all these years?

26:17.118 --> 26:20.326
There are things you
simply aren't mature enough
to understand yet.

26:20.830 --> 26:25.244
Yeah, like how you can let
your own son die like this.

26:27.211 --> 26:28.667
Your own brother!

26:30.840 --> 26:31.920
He's not gonna die.

26:32.008 --> 26:34.750
Thanks to you,
Peter has the ability
to survive.

26:36.471 --> 26:40.931
So he lives and
kills millions of people.

26:42.310 --> 26:45.427
How can you let him
be responsible for
something like that?

26:45.521 --> 26:47.898
And how can you
live with yourself if he is?

26:50.610 --> 26:53.693
Claire, I know that
it's hard for you to
trust me right now,

26:55.239 --> 26:57.571
but this is all gonna
make sense very soon.

27:00.036 --> 27:01.617
I promise.

27:01.704 --> 27:04.696
We're offering you everything
you've ever wanted, Claire,

27:05.416 --> 27:08.954
a place to belong,
a family.

27:25.061 --> 27:27.222
I already have a family.

27:28.397 --> 27:29.523
NATHAN: No!

27:52.129 --> 27:54.040
I know what you're
thinking, Nathan.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.966
Let her go.
You understand.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.690
How many times have
I saved your ass?

28:18.781 --> 28:20.988
I'm the only reason
that you're still alive.

28:23.452 --> 28:27.365
Niki, that's not me.
Stop her. Find Micah.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.030
What?

28:30.126 --> 28:33.618
I said, stop her.
That's not me.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.501
I'm not strong enough.

28:37.592 --> 28:39.628
Who the hell are
you talking to?

28:41.846 --> 28:43.131
(GRUNTS)

28:56.652 --> 28:58.233
MICAH: Mom?

28:58.321 --> 28:59.356
Micah?

28:59.739 --> 29:02.321
Mom, I'm in here!
Itslocked.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.278
Mom!

29:08.205 --> 29:10.070
Is it really you?

29:13.336 --> 29:15.793
It's me, baby.

29:17.173 --> 29:18.879
It's just me.

29:41.155 --> 29:44.693
Wait! He could
be a bad guy.

29:44.784 --> 29:46.490
He needs my help.

29:50.373 --> 29:51.863
(WHISPERING)
Okay, we need to get
him out of here.

29:59.423 --> 30:01.004
It's not working.

30:01.092 --> 30:03.333
They must have
shut it down.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.133
Okay, I need a lookout.
Can you do that?

30:05.221 --> 30:06.757
Stand over here
and keep an eye out.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.803
If anyone comes,
tell me straightaway.

30:16.816 --> 30:19.228
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

30:26.117 --> 30:27.448
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

31:29.263 --> 31:30.252
Hiro!

31:47.448 --> 31:52.363
Invisibility, always
thought that that would
be a good one to have.

31:52.953 --> 31:54.864
I don't understand.
How is this happening?

31:55.623 --> 31:56.612
You're alive.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.415
Is this a dream?

32:00.795 --> 32:02.376
Am I time traveling?

32:03.255 --> 32:04.916
Are you doing this?

32:05.007 --> 32:07.464
Doesn't really matter
what it is, does it?

32:07.551 --> 32:08.927
Only that you're here, now.

32:09.011 --> 32:11.878
Yeah, but I saw you
speaking to my mother.
You know about the bomb.

32:11.972 --> 32:14.179
You know about everything.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.518
You came here
because you needed to.

32:17.520 --> 32:21.684
You needed to hear
the truth before you
could save the world.

32:22.525 --> 32:24.356
Can I save the world?

32:24.443 --> 32:26.934
You've had the power
all along, Peter.

32:27.029 --> 32:29.190
You just needed
to learn how to use it.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.657
Why me?

32:30.741 --> 32:34.484
Because there has to be
one that's good,
there always has,

32:34.578 --> 32:38.912
and your heart has
the ability to love,
unconditionally.

32:38.999 --> 32:42.742
Like I told you,
in the end,
all that really matters

32:43.420 --> 32:44.705
is love.

32:50.845 --> 32:52.426
I'm tired now.

32:55.391 --> 32:57.882
Let's get you
your rest, then, sir.

32:58.769 --> 33:00.555
Call me Charles.

33:03.357 --> 33:04.597
MR. BENNET: Peter.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.357
Peter!

33:08.070 --> 33:09.731
Wake up! Wake up.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.324
I must have blacked out.

33:18.289 --> 33:19.529
How did you find me?

33:19.623 --> 33:22.205
I told you, we have
a tracking system.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.037
And where's Claire?

33:24.128 --> 33:25.914
She's safe.
She's with your mother.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.085
My mother?
Yeah.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.504
They're on their way
out of the city right now.

33:28.591 --> 33:29.751
Okay.

33:29.842 --> 33:31.457
Then you need
to leave, too.

33:31.552 --> 33:32.541
I don't think
I can control this.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.752
No. I'm staying
with you.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.345
You saved
my daughter's life.

33:37.433 --> 33:39.048
I told you
I owed you for that.

33:40.144 --> 33:41.850
Consider this payback.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.768
Yeah, but if I can't
stop Sylar,

33:44.273 --> 33:46.434
if I lose it, I could...

33:47.276 --> 33:49.267
I will put you
down myself.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.318
Don't worry.
I'm a pretty good shot.

33:56.827 --> 33:58.533
Thank you, Mr. Bennet.

33:59.622 --> 34:01.158
Call me Noah.

34:04.126 --> 34:05.627
Come on.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.464
The guards are coming!

34:11.800 --> 34:13.176
Dad!

34:14.803 --> 34:16.009
Micah?

34:16.096 --> 34:17.802
We have to go.
