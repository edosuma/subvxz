WEBVTT

00:00.875 --> 00:04.173
Hot in Cleveland is recored in
front of a live studio audience.

00:04.328 --> 00:06.774
Did you know Cleveland
was originally spelled...

00:06.830 --> 00:09.860
c-l-e-a-v-e-l-a-n-d?

00:09.940 --> 00:11.496
From John Moses cleaveland,

00:11.528 --> 00:13.438
- see, their dropped the 'a'...!
- Shut up!

00:14.199 --> 00:17.621
Thank you.

00:17.654 --> 00:19.149
The nominations for
the daytime emmys...

00:19.183 --> 00:20.312
- were just announced.
- Oh.

00:20.346 --> 00:23.469
All right, who cares,
who cares, ah--

00:23.503 --> 00:25.894
best actress.
Susan lucci...

00:25.929 --> 00:29.349
Well-deserved.

00:29.384 --> 00:32.772
Crystal mcallister,
nobody, nobody, and...

00:32.807 --> 00:33.935
Victoria Chase!

00:33.969 --> 00:36.327
Yay!
Good for you.

00:36.362 --> 00:38.421
Oh, it's my 16th nomination.
Uh, waiter?

00:38.455 --> 00:41.112
Uh, I realize it's only
8:00 in the morning,

00:41.147 --> 00:42.839
but we're celebrating,
and I would like...

00:42.874 --> 00:44.900
some champagne
in my orange juice.

00:44.934 --> 00:48.089
You mean the usual?

00:48.124 --> 00:50.714
Yes.

00:50.749 --> 00:53.506
Although I've never won
this thing.

00:53.539 --> 00:56.330
And this year, I definitely
don't have a chance.

00:56.365 --> 00:58.989
<i>Crystal mcallister from
the strong and the gorgeous...</i>

00:59.022 --> 01:01.380
pulled a really underhanded
stunt.

01:01.414 --> 01:02.609
What'd she do?

01:02.644 --> 01:05.500
She died.

01:05.535 --> 01:07.593
Aka award magnet.

01:07.628 --> 01:09.853
You know I can't compete
with death.

01:11.216 --> 01:13.475
Oh, it's my son.

01:13.509 --> 01:14.771
He's driving back to college
from L.A.

01:14.805 --> 01:16.465
And I begged him to stop here
on the way.

01:16.500 --> 01:17.728
So he's gonna be here
this afternoon.

01:17.763 --> 01:19.290
Well, how's he doing?

01:19.324 --> 01:21.715
You know, I don't know.
He rarely speaks to me.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.609
I get the occasional grunt
on mother's day.

01:23.644 --> 01:26.134
Oh, kids can be
so ungrateful.

01:26.168 --> 01:28.493
I mean, you get them
the best nannies money can buy...

01:28.527 --> 01:30.022
and then they blackmail you
with threats...

01:30.056 --> 01:33.877
<i>to write a mommie dearest.</i>

01:33.911 --> 01:37.265
Oh, look who's back
from Hollywood.

01:37.299 --> 01:39.359
What was it like
doing Brad pitt's eyebrows?

01:39.393 --> 01:42.349
Does he smell like
fresh cream...

01:42.383 --> 01:44.874
on a fine spring morning?

01:44.908 --> 01:48.895
'Cause that's how
I imagine it.

01:48.929 --> 01:51.054
Elka, celebrities
are just like everyone else.

01:51.088 --> 01:53.547
You take that back.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.108
Oh, I'm just
starting to wonder...

01:55.142 --> 01:56.304
if there isn't more to life...

01:56.338 --> 01:58.631
than removing celebrities'
unwanted hair.

01:58.664 --> 02:01.055
I think I'm having
a mid-life crisis.

02:01.090 --> 02:05.243
Mid-life?

02:05.277 --> 02:07.768
You know, if you really are
having a crisis,

02:07.802 --> 02:09.097
maybe you should see
a therapist.

02:09.131 --> 02:11.721
The only therapy I need
is liquid therapy.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.945
Hello.

02:14.979 --> 02:16.606
Victoria got another
emmy nomination.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.769
Congratulations.

02:17.803 --> 02:19.198
She can't win.

02:19.232 --> 02:23.052
She's up against a dead girl.

02:23.087 --> 02:25.344
You didn't have
Susan Lucci killed, did you?

02:25.379 --> 02:28.734
No. That was just trash talk.

02:31.042 --> 02:38.485
Sync by mczolly
www.addic7ed.com

02:38.913 --> 02:42.253
the oddest thing
just happened.

02:42.288 --> 02:45.361
My Agent says that
there's this huge Internet rumor...

02:45.395 --> 02:48.369
that I'm dying from
some disease called...

02:48.403 --> 02:50.841
Well, I can't even remember
the name.

02:50.875 --> 02:53.346
Flett-giordano syndrome.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.616
And you're welcome.

02:54.650 --> 02:57.556
What?
You started the rumor?

02:57.591 --> 02:59.093
Well, now you can beat
the dead girl...

02:59.128 --> 03:00.931
at her own game.

03:00.966 --> 03:02.235
But--

03:02.269 --> 03:04.640
but you can't just say that
I have a disease.

03:04.674 --> 03:06.245
I've never even heard of it.

03:06.279 --> 03:09.051
Well, no one has.
That's the beauty of it.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.194
Uh, Victoria Chase.

03:13.228 --> 03:17.104
<i>Yes, I'll hold for
people magazine.</i>

03:18.241 --> 03:19.376
Elka.

03:19.411 --> 03:21.849
I need a list
of really fun things...

03:21.883 --> 03:23.151
to do in Cleveland.

03:23.186 --> 03:25.156
Will's coming,
and we haven't really...

03:25.191 --> 03:26.426
spoken much since
the divorce,

03:26.461 --> 03:27.931
and I really wanna
reconnect with him.

03:27.965 --> 03:29.968
So if you were
a 20-year-old boy,

03:30.002 --> 03:33.209
what would you wanna do
with your mom?

03:33.244 --> 03:37.286
Watch her buy me beer?

03:37.321 --> 03:40.127
Hey, joy.
Where you been?

03:40.161 --> 03:42.131
Okay, don't go all Melanie
on me,

03:42.165 --> 03:43.935
but I decided to take
your suggestion...

03:43.970 --> 03:46.675
and I met with a couple
of potential therapists.

03:46.710 --> 03:49.182
Wow. How did it go?

03:49.216 --> 03:50.885
They're all so nosy.

03:50.919 --> 03:52.489
Asking me questions about...

03:52.524 --> 03:55.597
my childhood
and feelings and sex...

03:55.632 --> 03:57.535
and saying I need to come in
four times a week.

03:57.569 --> 04:00.508
I mean, who can talk about
themselves for that long?

04:00.543 --> 04:03.616
And then at age 12,
I decided becoming an actress...

04:03.651 --> 04:06.557
would be the best way
to serve humanity.

04:06.591 --> 04:08.027
<i>No, no, no, thank you.</i>

04:08.061 --> 04:10.232
Oh, Elka.

04:10.266 --> 04:12.571
You are a genius.

04:12.605 --> 04:14.409
Elka came up with
this Internet rumor...

04:14.443 --> 04:17.450
that I have this very,
very promotable deadly disease.

04:17.483 --> 04:21.226
Well, I'm sure nothing could
go wrong with that.

04:21.260 --> 04:24.634
Oh.
It's a text from my Agent.

04:24.668 --> 04:28.644
<i>Entertainment weekly
and in style magazine...</i>

04:28.678 --> 04:30.046
both want me.

04:30.081 --> 04:32.385
Oh, and, and also,

04:32.419 --> 04:34.858
the flett-giordano
syndrome foundation...

04:34.892 --> 04:36.463
want to come
and meet with me here.

04:36.497 --> 04:39.436
Oh, well, this will just
legitimize the hell out of it.

04:40.874 --> 04:42.811
What kind of disease
is it?

04:42.846 --> 04:45.617
I-I don't know.
Elka?

04:45.652 --> 04:46.954
You know, I'm,
I'm happy to lie to win,

04:46.988 --> 04:49.427
but I-I don't wanna
lose my hair or anything.

04:49.461 --> 04:52.367
- The only symptom is fatigue.
- That's perfect.

04:52.402 --> 04:54.239
I mean, I can play tired
in my sleep.

04:56.177 --> 04:58.816
Ah, luckily, this disease
hasn't affected my wit.

05:00.254 --> 05:03.627
Oh, that's will.
My baby's here.

05:03.662 --> 05:05.332
Hi, honey!

05:05.366 --> 05:07.970
- Hi, just a sec.
- Okay.

05:08.005 --> 05:11.212
It's good to see you.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.894
- Good to see you, sweetie.
- Yeah.

05:17.929 --> 05:19.666
The facial hair
makes you look a little...

05:19.700 --> 05:22.005
Foreign, but cute.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.141
Come on in.

05:23.175 --> 05:24.478
You know joy and Victoria.

05:24.512 --> 05:26.182
- Both: Hey, will.
- Hi.

05:26.217 --> 05:27.351
Ah, this is Elka Ostrovsky.

05:27.386 --> 05:29.289
Nice to meet you, will.

05:29.324 --> 05:30.526
Nice to meet you too.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.798
Well, your mom picks up
and moves to Cleveland.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.268
You must have
a million questions.

05:34.302 --> 05:36.808
No, I'm good.

05:36.842 --> 05:38.145
I fixed up the guest room
for you,

05:38.179 --> 05:39.782
but I thought maybe
we'd go out to lunch first.

05:39.816 --> 05:41.787
I kinda just wanna crash,
if that's cool.

05:41.821 --> 05:45.161
Sure. Sure.
It's cool. Very cool.

05:45.195 --> 05:46.497
Do you want me to show you
where the room is?

05:46.532 --> 05:48.636
- I'll find it.
- Yeah. You can find it.

05:48.670 --> 05:50.174
You're good like that.

05:50.208 --> 05:51.677
He can find it.

05:51.711 --> 05:53.146
I hope it's your daughter...

05:53.182 --> 05:56.789
who's gonna decide
which home to put you in.

06:01.802 --> 06:04.341
Well, this is fun.
The two of us.

06:04.375 --> 06:06.613
Getting a chance to talk
and catch up...

06:06.647 --> 06:10.388
and shoot the breeze.

06:12.361 --> 06:14.030
So how's school?

06:14.065 --> 06:16.804
- Good.
- Oh. Yeah?

06:17.941 --> 06:20.312
Well, you certainly have
a lot to say...

06:20.347 --> 06:23.019
To someone.

06:23.053 --> 06:24.689
- What?
- Nothing.

06:24.724 --> 06:27.028
You know.
I text. So I get it.

06:27.062 --> 06:28.399
Sorry,
what did you say, mom?

06:28.433 --> 06:31.974
You know, lol.
Omg.

06:32.009 --> 06:35.516
Om--
you know what--g.

06:35.551 --> 06:38.055
You know it's not cursing
if you say a letter, mom.

06:38.089 --> 06:39.626
Oh, sure. Sure.

06:39.661 --> 06:41.998
"F."
"F!"...

06:45.107 --> 06:47.645
You know, honey.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.684
We never got a chance
to talk about the divorce.

06:49.718 --> 06:51.956
And we can do that,
if you'd like.

06:51.990 --> 06:53.659
No, I get it.

06:53.694 --> 06:56.299
Stuff happens.
I'm good.

06:56.334 --> 06:59.207
Okay.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:08.229 --> 07:09.932
Did you know...

07:09.966 --> 07:12.673
That Cleveland
was originally spelled...

07:12.707 --> 07:16.482
c-l-e-a-v-e-l-a-n-d?

07:16.516 --> 07:18.085
The Cleveland spelling?

07:18.120 --> 07:20.558
You went to that?

07:20.593 --> 07:22.329
I was desperate.

07:22.363 --> 07:25.771
And how does that
make you feel, Melanie?

07:27.142 --> 07:28.377
What?

07:28.412 --> 07:30.816
It's an annoying question,
isn't it?

07:30.850 --> 07:32.554
But all the therapists
ask it.

07:32.588 --> 07:34.726
I've been trying
different ones every day.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.296
It's a little bit like dating...

07:36.330 --> 07:39.804
except you're not trying to hide
how crazy you are.

07:42.779 --> 07:45.050
Hello. All.

07:49.863 --> 07:53.036
Victoria, are you okay?
You look exhausted.

07:53.070 --> 07:55.141
Oh, good.

07:56.913 --> 07:58.316
I was just making sure...

07:58.350 --> 08:00.254
'cause the foundation people
will be here soon.

08:02.227 --> 08:04.397
Oh, that's will's phone.

08:04.432 --> 08:07.505
Why is it he can talk to
everybody else but not to me?

08:07.539 --> 08:09.041
You mustn't blame yourself.

08:09.076 --> 08:10.946
Now I-I did absolutely
everything I could...

08:10.981 --> 08:12.283
for both my kids.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.555
You've got three children.

08:15.993 --> 08:17.662
Ah.

08:17.696 --> 08:20.035
Oh, if this phone
could only talk.

08:20.069 --> 08:21.504
Well, it can if
you want it to.

08:21.539 --> 08:25.013
Everything you want to know
about will is right in there.

08:25.047 --> 08:29.190
His friends, his music,
everything.

08:29.224 --> 08:32.030
No, no, I-I can't invade
his privacy that way.

08:32.065 --> 08:34.135
I can.

08:34.169 --> 08:36.508
No, put that down.
Someone's texting him.

08:36.542 --> 08:38.346
It's from Stephanie.

08:38.380 --> 08:40.183
"Did you tell your mom yet?

08:40.217 --> 08:43.157
Did she freak?"...

08:43.191 --> 08:44.527
Freak? About what?

08:44.561 --> 08:45.830
What does he need to tell me?

08:45.865 --> 08:47.032
Well, find out yourself.

08:47.068 --> 08:51.142
Pretend you're will
and text her back.

08:51.177 --> 08:53.984
I shouldn't do that.

08:54.018 --> 08:55.487
But as a mother,

08:55.521 --> 08:57.191
I need to know what's going on
with my son...

08:57.226 --> 08:58.928
by any means possible,
right?

08:58.962 --> 09:00.299
- Indeed you do.
- Absolutely.

09:00.333 --> 09:04.074
Okay.

09:05.813 --> 09:10.690
"How should I tell her?"...

09:10.724 --> 09:11.993
Oh, I shouldn't have
done that.

09:12.028 --> 09:14.098
I just totally violated
his privacy.

09:14.133 --> 09:15.836
I am done with this.

09:15.871 --> 09:18.375
Ooh, she texted back.

09:19.780 --> 09:23.287
"Why are you texting
like an old lady?"...

09:24.893 --> 09:27.464
Ah, you shouldn't have
spelled everything correctly.

09:27.498 --> 09:29.536
Oh.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.041
"Just tell her
we're getting married"?

09:32.076 --> 09:33.879
Oh, my God.

09:33.914 --> 09:35.350
He's only 20 years old.

09:35.384 --> 09:36.954
I've never even heard of
this girl.

09:36.989 --> 09:40.428
And how does that
make you feel?

09:44.339 --> 09:47.078
Uh,
"my mom got married young...

09:47.113 --> 09:50.955
and still regrets it."

09:50.989 --> 09:52.324
That ought to do it.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.199
"Are you trying
to tell me something?"...

09:56.234 --> 10:01.312
What, is she stupid?

10:01.347 --> 10:05.823
"Just that we should
slow down."

10:07.194 --> 10:11.537
"I h8 u, d'bag."

10:11.571 --> 10:13.775
What does that mean?

10:13.810 --> 10:17.418
Well, 8 could be ate.
Like, "I ate something."

10:17.453 --> 10:21.127
- Mm.
- And d'bag is like da bomb?

10:21.161 --> 10:24.669
I hate you, douche bag.

10:32.751 --> 10:34.084
Hey, Elka.

10:34.118 --> 10:35.351
Thanks for letting me
borrow this.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.751
Oh. What did you think of
my mall walk mix?

10:37.785 --> 10:38.951
Not bad.

10:38.986 --> 10:42.151
A little surprised by
all the Justin bieber.

10:42.186 --> 10:43.952
Really?

10:43.987 --> 10:45.986
I love her.

10:51.555 --> 10:52.988
He's a guy.

10:53.022 --> 10:55.321
They keep saying that.

10:55.356 --> 10:57.321
But I'm not buying it.

10:59.990 --> 11:01.155
What am I gonna do?

11:01.190 --> 11:03.422
I-I broke them up.
He's gonna hate me.

11:03.457 --> 11:05.757
Oh, will.
Hi, honey.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.190
Is that my phone
in your pocket?

11:07.224 --> 11:10.124
Or are you just happy
to see me?

11:10.158 --> 11:13.825
Oh, God,
that's all kinds of wrong.

11:13.859 --> 11:15.525
Uh, no. Mine.

11:15.560 --> 11:19.159
- Okay, I'm gonna go shower.
- Okay.

11:19.194 --> 11:20.792
Quick.
How do I write her back?

11:20.827 --> 11:22.960
Just text her everything ys.

11:22.995 --> 11:24.827
Yeah, compliment her face
without makeup,

11:24.861 --> 11:26.861
and tell her it's the best sex
you ever had.

11:26.895 --> 11:30.061
This is my son.

11:30.096 --> 11:32.061
Oh, they're here.

11:32.096 --> 11:33.295
All right, uh.

11:33.329 --> 11:34.462
Look, I'd love to stay...

11:34.496 --> 11:35.563
and help you pretend
to be your son,

11:35.597 --> 11:39.197
but I have to go pretend
I'm dying.

11:46.532 --> 11:48.565
Hello. I'm Victoria Chase.

11:48.599 --> 11:50.698
This is
Dr. Lori Hernandez.

11:50.733 --> 11:52.699
I'm Dr. Robert Moore.

11:52.734 --> 11:54.566
It's a pleasure to meet you.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.000
Ah. Likewise.

11:57.034 --> 11:58.567
I'm sorry for staring,

11:58.601 --> 12:01.301
but I'm just surprised at
how well you look.

12:01.335 --> 12:05.235
Oh, thank you,
but I'm tired.

12:05.270 --> 12:06.736
So very tired.
Please sit.

12:06.770 --> 12:08.569
I know that I need to.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.669
Hmm, that's very odd.

12:10.703 --> 12:11.936
What?

12:11.970 --> 12:13.436
You're not limping
at all.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.637
Limping?

12:14.671 --> 12:17.104
It's the first symptom
of flett-giordano.

12:17.138 --> 12:19.738
Would you just excuse me
for just one moment?

12:28.374 --> 12:29.439
Where's Elka?

12:29.474 --> 12:31.274
She said this thing had
no symptoms...

12:31.308 --> 12:32.440
and I'm out there...

12:32.475 --> 12:35.674
limping around like
Dr. house.

12:37.175 --> 12:39.075
Elka said she looked it up
on Wikipedia.

12:39.110 --> 12:40.276
Wikipedia?

12:40.310 --> 12:42.743
Wikipedia says that
I'm 37.

12:42.777 --> 12:44.776
And I should know.
I'm the one who "corrected" it.

12:44.810 --> 12:46.943
Okay, calm down.

12:46.977 --> 12:50.044
I'll look it up online.

12:50.078 --> 12:51.544
Oh.

12:51.579 --> 12:53.278
I'm terribly sorry.

12:53.312 --> 12:55.778
Uh...

12:55.812 --> 12:57.379
So in,
in terms of publicity,

12:57.413 --> 12:58.612
I was thinking--

12:58.647 --> 13:00.846
miss Chase, when exactly
were you diagnosed?

13:00.880 --> 13:03.480
Uh, last week. Why?

13:03.514 --> 13:05.114
The most acute symptoms...

13:05.148 --> 13:07.481
occur within
the first week of onset.

13:07.515 --> 13:09.547
By now, you should be
having trouble with...

13:09.582 --> 13:14.016
facial drooping,
involuntary body spasms,

13:14.050 --> 13:16.349
word slurring, hysteria.

13:16.384 --> 13:21.183
Boy, this thing is awful.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.950
Yes, it is.

13:22.984 --> 13:24.617
That's why we applaud
your courage in going public...

13:24.652 --> 13:26.351
with such a disfiguring
disease.

13:26.386 --> 13:27.785
Disfiguring?

13:27.819 --> 13:29.885
Who said anything about
disfiguring?

13:29.919 --> 13:32.786
Well.
There's that hysteria.

13:34.353 --> 13:35.486
Miss Chase,

13:35.520 --> 13:36.986
I understand why
you're wearing this scarf,

13:37.021 --> 13:38.387
but may we just take a look?

13:38.421 --> 13:41.854
Oh, um, listen.

13:41.888 --> 13:44.921
Could you just excuse me
for just one more second?

13:53.724 --> 13:55.957
Wow.

13:55.991 --> 13:58.658
This sucker's got
a lot of symptoms.

13:58.692 --> 14:02.292
No shissh, Sherlock.

14:02.326 --> 14:03.792
Good luck faking
the goiter.

14:03.826 --> 14:05.159
Goiter?

14:05.193 --> 14:06.526
Oh, my God.

14:06.559 --> 14:08.693
That's why they wanted to see
my neck.

14:08.727 --> 14:12.360
Oh, good lord.

14:13.695 --> 14:15.894
Ooh.

14:15.928 --> 14:17.395
- It worked.
- Yay.

14:17.429 --> 14:20.461
She says she loves you
and she's sorry and--

14:20.496 --> 14:21.828
oh, she's sending you
a picture.

14:21.863 --> 14:24.029
Yes.

14:24.063 --> 14:27.063
Perky.

14:29.631 --> 14:31.497
Just erase it.
He's coming.

14:31.531 --> 14:34.131
Done.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.598
Hey, will.
We found your phone.

14:35.632 --> 14:37.132
Oh, awesome, thanks.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.465
Oh, no.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.799
What, is something wrong?

14:40.833 --> 14:42.233
It's just this girl,
Stephanie,

14:42.267 --> 14:43.400
I have to break up with.

14:43.434 --> 14:44.800
What?

14:44.834 --> 14:47.100
She's kind of psycho
and we dated a couple months.

14:47.135 --> 14:48.467
Now she thinks we're engaged.

14:48.502 --> 14:51.701
Yeah, because you proposed
to her.

14:51.735 --> 14:53.502
Were you spying on
my phone?

14:53.536 --> 14:56.269
Ugh...
Oh, honey, yes.

14:56.304 --> 14:58.503
And that's how I found out
you were engaged.

14:58.537 --> 15:00.403
And I went crazy
so I texted back.

15:00.437 --> 15:01.569
And then we broke up,

15:01.604 --> 15:03.237
but then we got back
together again,

15:03.271 --> 15:05.737
and now she thinks that
you love her more than ever.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.471
Oh, honey,
I just wanted things...

15:07.506 --> 15:08.638
to be better between us.

15:08.673 --> 15:10.905
By doing something
completely Shady.

15:10.939 --> 15:12.239
How could I ever trust you
again?

15:12.273 --> 15:14.139
Oh...Honey.

15:14.173 --> 15:18.640
No, will. I'm sorry.

15:18.675 --> 15:23.007
Well, on the plus side
he's not getting married.

15:23.042 --> 15:25.241
And you raised a son
with enough character...

15:25.275 --> 15:26.741
to break up with
the wrong girl...

15:26.776 --> 15:28.175
even though she has...

15:28.209 --> 15:30.942
a truly spectacular set
of knockers.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.242
And the reason
I don't have a goiter...

15:36.357 --> 15:39.955
is because as an actress,
my...

15:39.989 --> 15:45.019
My vocal chords
are so highly developed.

15:45.053 --> 15:46.884
Well, 's coming.

15:46.919 --> 15:48.050
Now, um, miss Chase,

15:48.084 --> 15:50.749
which of your parents
is asian?

15:50.783 --> 15:52.948
What?

15:52.982 --> 15:54.514
Well, the disease
is only carried...

15:54.549 --> 15:56.246
by people of asian descent,
so--

15:56.281 --> 15:58.112
ah. Yes.

15:58.146 --> 16:02.576
Well, my father, you'll see,
is asian.

16:02.610 --> 16:05.341
Okay, you know what?
I just--I can't do this.

16:05.376 --> 16:09.673
You see, I don't really have
the disease.

16:09.707 --> 16:10.772
What?

16:10.807 --> 16:13.204
I just said that I did
because I thought...

16:13.238 --> 16:15.603
it would help me win
an emmy.

16:15.638 --> 16:17.868
Well, that's...

16:17.903 --> 16:19.735
Reprehensible.

16:19.769 --> 16:21.400
I know.

16:21.435 --> 16:23.166
I--I feel terrible.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.732
As you should.

16:24.766 --> 16:27.731
Although,
in the last week,

16:27.765 --> 16:29.496
she has brought
the foundation...

16:29.531 --> 16:31.695
a great deal of money
and attention.

16:31.730 --> 16:33.294
It would be nice
not to share offices...

16:33.328 --> 16:37.359
with the toenail fungus
people.

16:37.393 --> 16:39.391
Wait, what are you saying?

16:39.426 --> 16:41.823
Well, um...

16:41.857 --> 16:44.822
If you attend
our fundraising event next week,

16:44.856 --> 16:47.187
we promise not tell everyone
that you're a...

16:47.221 --> 16:49.253
Despicable liar.

16:49.287 --> 16:50.852
Well, I guess that I,

16:50.887 --> 16:52.718
I don't really have a leg
to stand on.

16:52.752 --> 16:54.251
No, and while we're
on that subject,

16:54.285 --> 16:56.083
work on your limping.

16:56.117 --> 16:57.449
Oh, and get dark glasses.

16:57.483 --> 17:00.480
You'll be blind by then.

17:02.946 --> 17:04.444
Oh, there you are.

17:04.479 --> 17:05.877
Your mum went out
looking for you.

17:05.912 --> 17:07.042
I know.

17:07.078 --> 17:08.742
Oh, I lost her
two streets over.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.108
Look, she made a mistake.

17:10.144 --> 17:12.040
But she was just trying
to get you to talk.

17:12.076 --> 17:13.241
I know.

17:13.275 --> 17:16.204
And how does that
make you feel?

17:16.240 --> 17:17.339
What?

17:17.373 --> 17:18.704
Never mind.

17:18.739 --> 17:22.336
I'm gonna tell you
how it makes you feel.

17:22.369 --> 17:24.901
See, for the past week,
I've been seeing therapists...

17:24.935 --> 17:26.701
and they've been trying
to get me to talk.

17:26.734 --> 17:28.433
But I don't like it.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.831
Partly because it's none of
their bloody business.

17:30.866 --> 17:33.131
But mostly because
I'm afraid if...

17:33.165 --> 17:35.430
I do start to open up
and let it out,

17:35.463 --> 17:39.228
I might completely
fall apart.

17:39.262 --> 17:40.627
Is that how
it makes you feel?

17:40.661 --> 17:44.091
Yeah,
that's pretty much it.

17:44.126 --> 17:46.624
So I just don't wanna
talk about it at all.

17:46.658 --> 17:49.555
But it doesn't make you
any less angry, does it?

17:49.590 --> 17:51.155
No.

17:51.189 --> 17:52.854
Look, I understand.

17:52.888 --> 17:54.420
My dad left my mum...

17:54.454 --> 17:57.152
and it really messed with
my head and my trust.

17:57.186 --> 18:00.217
And when I was in my 20s,

18:00.251 --> 18:03.082
I let my guard down,
fell madly in love,

18:03.117 --> 18:06.813
planned a huge wedding,
and the guy didn't show up.

18:06.848 --> 18:09.278
- Wow, that really sucks.
- No kidding.

18:09.313 --> 18:11.378
Must have been
so humiliating.

18:11.412 --> 18:12.677
I don't like to dwell
on it.

18:12.711 --> 18:14.343
I mean, just standing up there
in your wedding dress...

18:14.378 --> 18:15.908
and all those people
staring at you?

18:15.943 --> 18:18.308
The point is,

18:18.342 --> 18:21.173
I know a little bit
about anger.

18:21.208 --> 18:23.005
And it's not healthy
to hold on to it...

18:23.040 --> 18:25.204
or to take it out
on other people.

18:25.238 --> 18:28.269
Especially someone
as sweet as your mum.

18:28.304 --> 18:31.601
It's killing her that
she can't connect with you.

18:31.635 --> 18:33.400
I gotta tell you,

18:33.434 --> 18:36.032
whoever that guy was,
it was his loss.

18:36.066 --> 18:38.164
Thank you.

18:38.199 --> 18:42.795
Because you must have been
so hot back then.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.260
Yes. Way back then.

18:46.461 --> 18:49.459
Oh. Here she is now.
Talk to her.

18:49.493 --> 18:52.490
It'll be fine.
I promise.

18:54.557 --> 18:56.655
Hi, sweetie.

18:56.689 --> 19:00.287
Listen, um...

19:00.321 --> 19:02.286
I don't know what to say.

19:02.320 --> 19:06.017
Neither do I.

19:06.051 --> 19:08.316
But we can try.

19:08.350 --> 19:10.781
Really?

19:10.816 --> 19:12.313
Yeah.

19:12.348 --> 19:13.746
So where do you wanna start?

19:13.780 --> 19:16.278
Well, the fact that dad's
engaged to a 25-year-old...

19:18.012 --> 19:20.143
Or that I think I have
a crush on joy...

19:20.178 --> 19:24.374
and I'm pretty sure
she's feeling it too?

19:24.408 --> 19:26.140
Oh, wow.

19:26.175 --> 19:27.406
All right.

19:27.441 --> 19:30.205
So why did Cleveland
drop the "a" from its name?

19:33.870 --> 19:36.135
Well, the masthead for
the newspaper?

19:36.170 --> 19:37.301
Mm-hmm?

19:37.336 --> 19:38.467
They figured out
that it was, like,

19:38.501 --> 19:40.399
not long enough...

19:42.280 --> 19:43.586
Well, we're not bffs yet,

19:43.621 --> 19:47.508
but he did promise to text me
at least once a week.

19:47.542 --> 19:49.552
Thank you, joy.

19:49.588 --> 19:52.737
Oh, hey, how did
the foundation fundraiser go?

19:52.772 --> 19:54.648
Utterly exhausting.

19:54.683 --> 19:56.894
But it'll be worth it
just to see the smile on my face...

19:56.928 --> 19:59.776
when I win that emmy.

19:59.812 --> 20:02.760
And, of course,
announce my miraculous recovery.

20:02.794 --> 20:05.308
Yes.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.878
You know what?

20:11.912 --> 20:14.224
You know, I feel like
I really did a good thing.

20:14.259 --> 20:16.906
You know, which gives one
a certain glow,

20:16.940 --> 20:18.146
a little something extra.

20:18.181 --> 20:22.236
I'll say.

20:22.270 --> 20:25.957
I notice even now
a few people looking my way.

20:27.835 --> 20:32.292
In fact, quite a few people,
like...

20:33.936 --> 20:36.985
