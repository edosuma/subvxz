00:13.995 --> 00:17.329
Six hours ago a cache of weapons-grade
plutonium was found in a warehouse.

00:17.415 --> 00:20.784
We also found this.
What do you make of that, guys?

00:20.877 --> 00:25.504
- This is a bill of lading from our company.
- For a container sent to Syed Ali.

00:25.590 --> 00:30.003
I can track the shipping order.
The database is at the office.

00:30.095 --> 00:32.384
If my father really does
work for the government,

00:32.472 --> 00:37.015
wouldn't he have known
if Reza was doing something illegal?

00:38.145 --> 00:39.224
Who are you?

00:39.312 --> 00:42.479
My name is Syed Ali. You were
looking in places you do not belong.

00:42.566 --> 00:45.353
- I don't know anything!
- Kill her.

00:45.444 --> 00:46.523
No.

00:46.736 --> 00:51.363
We're going down! The pilots don't know
what happened. It felt like an explosion.

00:51.450 --> 00:55.032
- They were shot down?
- By a ground-to-air missile.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.405
That's not Search and Rescue.

00:58.498 --> 01:00.906
- Are they coming here for you?
- I don't know.

01:03.336 --> 01:04.416
Drop it.

01:04.504 --> 01:09.878
I'll tell you where the bomb is in exchange
for immunity, for the murder of Jack Bauer.

01:10.302 --> 01:12.129
Someone from CTU
is supposed to pick us up.

01:12.220 --> 01:14.592
Captain said it's out of their jurisdiction.

01:14.681 --> 01:17.967
- We told you why we can't go back to LA.
- Yeah, I know. The bomb.

01:18.059 --> 01:21.428
Miss Myers, if the information you provide

01:21.521 --> 01:24.392
culminates in the interception
of the nuclear device,

01:24.483 --> 01:27.816
you'll be pardoned in advance
for the murder of Jack Bauer.

01:27.903 --> 01:32.280
Mr President, there was only one
right choice to make and you made it.

01:39.498 --> 01:44.325
You've been told by a well-respected
member of the press, Mr Ron Wieland,

01:44.419 --> 01:49.081
that there is an imminent terrorist threat
levelled against this country.

01:50.050 --> 01:52.208
That is true, so far as it goes.

01:52.302 --> 01:55.303
Please.

01:56.223 --> 01:59.971
The fact is, we get a dozen
such threats every day.

02:00.060 --> 02:05.101
And do I know more about them
than I publicly reveal? Of course.

02:05.190 --> 02:09.401
What is released to the public and when
is a matter of judgment.

02:09.485 --> 02:12.059
You have elected me
to exercise that judgment

02:12.155 --> 02:15.156
in the best interests of this country.

02:17.536 --> 02:23.076
That's what I've done since I took office.
That's what I'm doing today.

02:23.166 --> 02:28.836
And I can assure you that we have
the situation well under control,

02:28.922 --> 02:30.962
and there is no cause for alarm.

02:31.049 --> 02:33.587
Thank you.

02:36.346 --> 02:39.133
Not the Gettysburg Address,
but it should buy us time.

02:39.224 --> 02:41.015
It was fine.

02:41.101 --> 02:46.142
- What's the situation with Jack Bauer?
- Still being held hostage by Nina Myers.

02:48.859 --> 02:53.734
It didn't have to be like this, Jack.
I never meant for it to be personal.

02:54.531 --> 02:57.104
It felt pretty personal
when you killed my wife.

02:57.200 --> 03:02.954
I had to. Teri overheard something
that compromised my escape route.

03:03.039 --> 03:06.823
What about bombing CTU?
All those people you used to work with?

03:06.918 --> 03:11.248
I didn't bomb CTU. I just sold the plans.

03:12.132 --> 03:15.631
You believe what you have to,
but you killed your friends.

03:15.719 --> 03:18.554
Shut up, Jack! Shut up!

03:19.306 --> 03:21.927
Now we are done talking!

03:23.518 --> 03:28.975
We're just gonna wait for Palmer to call
and then this'll all be over. You got it?

03:33.361 --> 03:38.901
You know what, Nina? You're right. I don't
really wanna just sit here and wait to die.

03:38.992 --> 03:41.400
Don't move, Jack!

03:41.495 --> 03:43.037
I mean it!

03:46.458 --> 03:49.506
You kill me before they verify
the information you gave them,

03:49.706 --> 03:51.452
you'll be in violation of your agreement.

03:51.546 --> 03:55.081
- They'll just slap your ass back in jail.
- And you'll be dead.

03:56.343 --> 03:58.668
I'm already dead.

04:00.013 --> 04:02.469
Last warning, Jack.

04:02.557 --> 04:05.428
That's it. One more step and I'll shoot.

04:07.521 --> 04:08.801
Argh!

04:08.897 --> 04:11.732
- Team one, move in! Go!
- Go, go go!

04:11.817 --> 04:14.224
- Move, move, move!
- Grab her!

04:16.154 --> 04:18.442
Secure the weapon.

04:19.406 --> 04:21.399
Got it.

04:22.661 --> 04:25.662
- Notify the chopper.
- Get her up.

04:29.334 --> 04:31.659
- Let's go.
- We're not going back to LA.

04:31.753 --> 04:33.580
We've been through this.

04:33.672 --> 04:36.673
- I told you before.
- I know, the bomb. Move. Walk.

04:36.758 --> 04:39.843
Forget about us.
You wanna get blown to pieces?

04:39.928 --> 04:43.344
I told you who my dad was.
You think they'd send someone from CTU?

04:43.432 --> 04:45.804
- Get in.
- I'm not going back to LA.

04:45.892 --> 04:49.724
- Miguel!
- Get down! Get down! Don't move.

04:49.813 --> 04:52.980
- I got him.
- Miguel!

04:55.068 --> 04:58.152
- Careful.
- Let's go. Get in.

05:02.159 --> 05:04.828
Yes. Good. Yes, I'll tell him.

05:06.079 --> 05:08.072
It's over.

05:09.249 --> 05:12.998
- Is Jack OK?
- They got to Nina before she shot him.

05:13.086 --> 05:13.911
What about her?

05:14.111 --> 05:16.751
As you requested,
she wasn't seriously hurt.

05:17.883 --> 05:20.884
They're awaiting orders.
Do you want her taken to prison?

05:20.969 --> 05:24.420
No. We'll honour our original deal.

05:24.514 --> 05:28.215
I'll pardon her as soon
as we confirm her information.

05:28.310 --> 05:31.726
- In the meantime, where do you want her?
- Los Angeles.

05:32.147 --> 05:35.812
Let her share the fate
of everyone she's endangered.

05:35.901 --> 05:38.024
Yes, sir.

05:41.031 --> 05:45.989
That's affirmative. I'll meet the chopper
just south of the gully in the field.

05:46.119 --> 05:48.575
- Roger that.
- Copy.

05:59.090 --> 06:01.167
Now...

07:00.485 --> 07:05.361
We're here to find transactions you claim
Bob Warner had with Syed Ali.

07:05.449 --> 07:08.366
The sooner we do that,
the sooner we're out of here.

07:08.452 --> 07:10.409
Have a seat.

07:13.373 --> 07:16.457
- I can't work like this.
- I'll be keying the computer.

07:22.507 --> 07:25.508
How do I open the invoice files?

07:30.390 --> 07:33.308
- What?
- I need to access the invoice files.

07:33.393 --> 07:37.438
- File, open, warehouse.
- How are they ordered?

07:37.522 --> 07:40.559
- Chronologically, I think.
- You think?

07:42.068 --> 07:46.695
Look, my fiancée just left me on my wedding
day because I'm sending her father to jail.

07:46.782 --> 07:51.325
And since he's my employer, that pretty
much means my whole life's in the toilet.

07:51.411 --> 07:54.994
So why don't you cut me some slack?

07:55.081 --> 07:58.332
There's a nuke somewhere in this city.

07:58.418 --> 08:02.665
And if you don't give me
something useful in the next hour,

08:02.756 --> 08:05.757
I'll take you back to CTU
and chain you to the roof,

08:05.842 --> 08:10.385
so you'll have a front row seat
when the damn thing goes off.

09:02.566 --> 09:05.483
Do you want to suffer as he did?

09:05.569 --> 09:07.941
No, of course not.

09:13.743 --> 09:19.330
Then tell me what you've learned
from your father's computer files,

09:19.416 --> 09:21.373
who you told.

09:22.127 --> 09:26.125
I already told you. I don't know anything.

09:52.616 --> 09:54.608
Jack Bauer.

09:58.789 --> 10:00.117
Jack?

10:00.207 --> 10:04.703
Mr President, the soldiers
that attacked us at the crash site,

10:04.795 --> 10:08.792
they were Americans,
or at least, American trained.

10:08.882 --> 10:10.506
What?

10:10.592 --> 10:14.886
One of the soldiers that was killed
had a tattoo of a coral snake on his arm.

10:14.971 --> 10:17.925
That's a signature of a group
out of Fort Benning.

10:18.016 --> 10:21.634
- What sort of group?
- A deep cover special ops unit.

10:21.728 --> 10:24.219
The only reason I know about the tattoos,

10:24.314 --> 10:27.315
is because early in my career
they tried to recruit me.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.520
Their commander is a Colonel Samuels.

10:30.612 --> 10:34.657
- I've never heard of this unit.
- No, you wouldn't have. That's the point.

10:34.741 --> 10:38.525
They'd be buried pretty heavily
in NSA's budget.

10:38.620 --> 10:39.948
NSA.

10:41.581 --> 10:43.408
OK.

10:43.500 --> 10:49.336
Even if NSA originally trained him, isn't it
possible he's freelancing now? A mercenary?

10:49.422 --> 10:52.092
If it was just the tattoo,
I'd agree with you.

10:52.175 --> 10:55.675
But the men that attacked us
had access to our flight plan.

10:55.762 --> 10:59.630
The only way they could have got
that information was from on the inside.

10:59.724 --> 11:04.967
Mr President, I know it sounds very far-fetched
that we got attacked by Americans,

11:05.063 --> 11:09.061
but that tattoo is
very distinctive and very specific.

11:09.151 --> 11:11.938
I appreciate the information.
Where are you now?

11:12.028 --> 11:16.489
We're in a chopper. We're on our way to
the address that Nina Meyers provided for us.

11:16.575 --> 11:20.442
We should be touching down soon, sir.
Our ETA is 15 minutes.

11:20.537 --> 11:24.036
- Keep me posted, Jack.
- Yes, Mr President.

11:32.799 --> 11:36.133
Jack's on his way to the Syed Ali house.
Do you want a feed up here?

11:36.219 --> 11:39.588
No. I assume you have that under control.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.633
Yeah, we do.

11:50.233 --> 11:53.020
Was there something else?

12:00.994 --> 12:02.702
I'm sorry.

12:11.838 --> 12:14.709
So what are you gonna do tomorrow?

12:14.800 --> 12:17.504
- What?
- If the bomb doesn't go off.

12:17.594 --> 12:19.587
Thought about it?

12:21.014 --> 12:22.212
No.

12:23.225 --> 12:25.976
You'll probably come back to work here?

12:26.812 --> 12:29.053
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

12:29.147 --> 12:33.774
I don't know. Are you happy in this job? Hm?

12:34.945 --> 12:40.319
Believe it or not, I used to want
to be a teacher... a long time ago.

12:41.034 --> 12:43.193
You know why I didn't?

12:43.286 --> 12:47.284
Cos DOD offered me more money.
That's how I made my decision.

12:49.626 --> 12:52.247
So I made myself miserable,

12:52.337 --> 12:58.672
and I made everybody else around me
miserable for an extra $5,000 a year.

12:59.469 --> 13:01.758
That was my price.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.009
Sorry.

13:09.396 --> 13:12.979
You know, Michelle,
I'm not a big advice giver,

13:13.066 --> 13:15.937
but under the circumstances...

13:17.154 --> 13:20.108
Don't wait around for your life
to happen to you.

13:20.198 --> 13:23.199
Find something that makes you happy, do it.

13:25.662 --> 13:30.158
Because everything else
is all just background noise.

13:45.932 --> 13:47.925
- Roger.
- Mr President.

13:50.729 --> 13:55.687
Tell me everything you know about
Colonel Ron Samuels from Fort Benning.

13:55.776 --> 13:57.982
I don't know anything about Samuels.

13:58.069 --> 14:03.028
What about a special ops units
from down there called Coral Snake?

14:03.116 --> 14:04.990
No, sir. Nothing.

14:05.076 --> 14:09.121
How could NSA be funding a paramilitary
group and you not know about it?

14:09.206 --> 14:12.372
Without knowing specifics,
I really can't say for sure.

14:14.044 --> 14:16.998
My guess is that the Department of Defense

14:17.088 --> 14:20.173
has used some of their
discretionary resources,

14:20.258 --> 14:24.837
attached our name for budgetary purposes.
It happens all the time.

14:24.930 --> 14:29.971
That's absurd. NSA is information gathering
only. They have no military mandate.

14:30.060 --> 14:34.389
I'd assume that this Coral Snake group,

14:34.481 --> 14:37.351
like many others that we see,

14:37.442 --> 14:42.069
falls under somebody's pet project,
gets funded on the sly.

14:42.155 --> 14:46.983
How would you know that, Roger? A minute
ago you told me you'd never heard of them.

14:47.077 --> 14:51.406
I'm just conjecturing from
past experience, Mr President.

14:52.916 --> 14:57.245
I have no concrete information.
Let me look into it.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.371
You do that.

15:21.570 --> 15:26.860
Jack Bauer's plane was shot down
by an American military unit.

15:26.950 --> 15:30.081
Jack told me himself.
I won't go into details,

15:30.281 --> 15:31.945
except to say that I believe him.

15:32.038 --> 15:34.529
American military? Why?

15:34.624 --> 15:36.950
I just spoke to Roger Stanton.

15:37.043 --> 15:40.744
I think he's hiding something from me.
I'm going to arrest him.

15:43.133 --> 15:45.090
Arrest the head of NSA?

15:46.595 --> 15:51.755
Bauer said the unit that attacked his plane
is connected to a Colonel Samuels.

15:52.517 --> 15:54.759
Samuels is funded by NSA.

15:56.062 --> 16:00.060
With all due respect, David,
that's pretty thin.

16:00.150 --> 16:01.941
By itself, yes.

16:02.027 --> 16:04.434
But the ambassador's chopper crash,

16:04.529 --> 16:07.898
the evacuation of
military personnel out of LA,

16:07.991 --> 16:13.198
Ron Wieland's escape from custody,
those things happened after Stanton arrived.

16:13.872 --> 16:18.581
Firing Stanton will cause chaos.
All the agencies report through him.

16:18.668 --> 16:21.753
He's running the search for the bomb,
for crying out loud.

16:21.838 --> 16:25.338
If the president's right,
he's not running it, he's impeding it.

16:25.425 --> 16:28.545
- Why would he do such a thing?
- I don't know.

16:28.637 --> 16:33.215
But if he is, we have a better chance
of finding the bomb if we get rid of him.

16:33.725 --> 16:35.350
David...

16:35.435 --> 16:38.105
you can't do this on a hunch.

16:38.188 --> 16:41.604
If Stanton turns out to be innocent
and that bomb goes off,

16:41.691 --> 16:44.265
you'll be blamed for the death of millions.

16:44.361 --> 16:48.405
If you do nothing and he is guilty
of something, you'll be blamed anyway.

16:48.490 --> 16:54.279
No, no, no. At the very least, we need
to get some kind of proof, some evidence.

16:54.371 --> 16:58.582
You cannot just arrest
the head of NSA, David.

16:58.667 --> 17:01.288
Sherry's right, Mike. We need proof.

17:03.588 --> 17:07.318
Find me a connection between
Stanton and this Colonel Samuels.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.175
And find it quickly.

17:19.354 --> 17:22.473
LA County 470, go ahead.

17:22.566 --> 17:27.108
This is Officer Brown with Valley.
I'm trying to reach Detective Bill Gucoff.

17:27.194 --> 17:31.359
Brown. You're transporting
two suspects down to Central?

17:31.450 --> 17:35.494
- Mm-hm, that's right.
- Hold on. I'll patch you through.

17:35.579 --> 17:37.820
- Gucoff here.
- Hey, Bill.

17:37.914 --> 17:41.330
- Yeah?
- I'm bringing the prisoners down.

17:42.085 --> 17:46.414
- All right. You got everything under control?
- The guy gave us trouble...

17:46.506 --> 17:49.958
- What?
- Get the bandanna out of my pocket.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.092
- Why?
- To start a fire.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.421
What? You're crazy.

17:55.515 --> 17:58.967
He'll have to pull over and stop the car.

17:59.060 --> 18:01.978
- And then he'll put it out. Then what?
- I don't know.

18:02.063 --> 18:07.354
Maybe it'll do enough damage and we'll have
to go back to the station. It'll buy us time.

18:07.444 --> 18:09.401
That is just crazy.

18:09.488 --> 18:14.196
Crazier than going to Los Angeles where
a nuclear bomb might go off any minute?

18:14.284 --> 18:17.071
Hey, listen, this may sound a little crazy,

18:17.162 --> 18:21.575
but did you happen to hear anything about
some kind of a bomb threat today?

18:21.666 --> 18:23.209
What?

18:23.293 --> 18:26.329
I can't do this. You gotta do it.

18:26.421 --> 18:29.541
- No.
- Kim, you can do it. You're smaller.

18:30.926 --> 18:32.717
No, I haven't heard anything.

18:32.803 --> 18:34.879
- Come on.
- You sure?

18:40.852 --> 18:44.720
Why? Somebody tell you
there was a bomb or something?

18:44.815 --> 18:49.607
What's going on? You know something
that I don't? What's up?

18:49.694 --> 18:53.443
I don't know. It may be nothing,
but one of the kids here,

18:53.532 --> 18:55.690
apparently her father works for CTU.

18:58.245 --> 19:01.032
He gave her some kind
of information about a bomb.

19:01.123 --> 19:05.037
Just check it out for me.
Like I said, it's probably nothing, but...

19:05.710 --> 19:07.833
No problem.

19:07.921 --> 19:10.922
OK, Gucoff. Thanks. I owe you one.

20:10.567 --> 20:13.354
- Kim.
- Hang on, OK?

20:23.830 --> 20:28.077
- Hello. Can anyone hear me?
- This is CHP Station Six.

20:28.168 --> 20:30.873
Kim. Kim. Don't.

20:31.922 --> 20:37.794
We're on San Fernando, the 118. There's
been an accident. We need an ambulance.

20:37.886 --> 20:41.337
- How's the officer?
- Hurt. So is someone else.

20:41.431 --> 20:43.887
- Two injured?
- Yes.

20:43.975 --> 20:47.475
- Stay there. We're sending someone now.
- Hang on.

20:47.562 --> 20:51.263
All units. All units proceed
to San Fernando at the 118.

20:51.358 --> 20:54.275
MVA. Officer down. Officer down.

21:18.176 --> 21:22.423
I'm gonna ask you just once more, huh?

21:23.390 --> 21:25.679
Who did you tell?

21:25.767 --> 21:27.890
No one.

21:32.107 --> 21:34.812
Here's an infrared of the house.
Two people in this room.

21:34.901 --> 21:38.436
We assume one is Ali,
but we'll need to take 'em both alive.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.653
- Your men in position?
- In 90 seconds.

21:40.740 --> 21:42.199
- Good.
- Yeah?

21:42.284 --> 21:44.241
- George, it's me.
- Where are you?

21:44.327 --> 21:48.111
I'm on site. Syed Ali's in the house.
We're gonna move in a minute.

21:48.206 --> 21:52.915
We need auxiliary teams ready to move as
soon as we find out the location of this bomb.

21:53.003 --> 21:57.997
- We're already working on it.
- I'll get back to you as soon as we get him.

21:59.384 --> 22:03.133
Agent Baker?
Let me know when your teams are ready.

22:07.267 --> 22:09.176
This is Bob Warner's access code.

22:09.269 --> 22:13.136
As you can see, he logged on
roughly twice as often as I did.

22:14.149 --> 22:18.194
- This is a restricted area.
- I need to speak with Reza.

22:18.278 --> 22:20.686
I'm afraid I can't do that.

22:20.781 --> 22:24.066
- Just a minute. It's our wedding day.
- I realise that.

22:24.159 --> 22:28.737
- We're in the middle of an investigation.
- Can I talk to him for one minute?

22:30.248 --> 22:34.163
- Can I talk to Reza for a minute?
- I tried to explain.

22:34.252 --> 22:37.004
- Make it fast.
- Thank you.

22:41.426 --> 22:43.882
Marie?

22:48.225 --> 22:51.428
Hey, what I said before, I didn't mean it.

22:52.145 --> 22:54.767
I'm so sorry. This has been such a shock.

22:54.856 --> 22:56.932
No, no, no. It's all right.

22:57.025 --> 22:59.350
You are the man I'm going to marry.

22:59.444 --> 23:01.855
I know, whatever you're doing,
you have to do it.

23:01.935 --> 23:04.521
I love you. Whatever happens, happens.

23:04.616 --> 23:07.024
My angel.

23:07.119 --> 23:12.113
We have to get back to work.
You can wait in the next room if you'd like.

23:12.207 --> 23:14.200
Thank you.

23:38.150 --> 23:42.313
It was barely a nick,
not nearly as bad as it feels.

23:51.413 --> 23:54.414
You don't have to kill me.

23:55.375 --> 23:58.329
Just leave me here.

23:58.420 --> 24:01.836
By the time someone finds me,
you'll be 100 miles away.

24:06.386 --> 24:10.466
Something's going to happen, very soon.

24:12.726 --> 24:17.803
Something terrible,
which will cause much suffering.

24:18.940 --> 24:21.182
This will be easier.

24:25.781 --> 24:27.820
Take cover!

24:31.286 --> 24:33.444
Fall back. Fall back.

24:33.538 --> 24:37.287
I have here a woman!
If you come any closer, I'll kill the woman!

24:40.587 --> 24:44.501
- Bring in the shield now.
- We need the body bunker right away.

24:46.635 --> 24:50.584
They don't negotiate. Yet they do shoot.

24:52.724 --> 24:55.808
It's not you they want alive, it's me.

24:56.728 --> 24:59.729
I'll try and take him out
with a beanbag hit.

25:24.589 --> 25:27.626
Suspect is secure.

25:27.717 --> 25:29.710
You're all right. You're all right.

25:29.803 --> 25:33.503
It's all right. It's all right.
Just relax. Take a breath.

25:33.598 --> 25:36.848
It's over. It's over. OK?

25:36.935 --> 25:40.849
- Jack, he's going into convulsions.
- What?

25:40.939 --> 25:45.731
- Did you see him take anything?
- I was watching him the whole time.

25:46.820 --> 25:49.109
Cyanide. He must have had it in his mouth.

25:49.197 --> 25:52.068
We need a medic in here now!
We need a medic now!

25:52.159 --> 25:54.531
Copy that.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.245
Damn it!

26:01.460 --> 26:05.160
I want him photographed, fingerprints.
Send it to CTU for analysis.

26:05.255 --> 26:08.256
I want confirmation that that is Syed Ali.

26:25.484 --> 26:28.935
You called them. You should go.

26:29.029 --> 26:31.567
I'll go when they get here.

26:31.656 --> 26:35.191
It'll be too late. They'll see you.

26:35.285 --> 26:37.076
I'll be fine.

26:44.294 --> 26:49.086
Thank you so much... for everything.

26:52.052 --> 26:57.259
As soon as this is all over,
I'm gonna find you. OK? I promise.

27:03.313 --> 27:05.306
Go.

27:39.182 --> 27:42.219
Notify Dispatch. 143.

27:46.565 --> 27:50.514
- Did you get the area locked down?
- Yes, sir.

27:55.949 --> 27:58.570
You should drink some water.

28:14.050 --> 28:16.968
Kate, my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm a federal agent.

28:17.053 --> 28:22.392
You've been through an ordeal, but I have
to ask you a few questions. Is that all right?

28:23.477 --> 28:26.264
- How did you get here?
- Um...

28:28.857 --> 28:33.400
I was... trying to help my sister.

28:33.487 --> 28:38.398
So I hired a private investigator.
Those men thought we knew something...

28:38.492 --> 28:44.577
Slow down, slow down. The dead man in
the other room was a private investigator?

28:46.291 --> 28:48.580
Paul Koplin.

28:48.668 --> 28:50.578
What they did to him...

28:50.670 --> 28:54.751
They? There was more than one man here?
How many men were there?

28:54.841 --> 28:59.468
Two. The other one left before you came.

28:59.554 --> 29:02.674
Did you get his name?

29:02.766 --> 29:05.339
- Syed Ali.
- Are you sure?

29:06.520 --> 29:09.639
Can you describe him for me?

29:09.731 --> 29:11.938
Tall. Thin.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.642
Do you remember what he was wearing?

29:14.736 --> 29:19.813
A black shirt.
With... silver buttons down the front.

29:19.908 --> 29:21.319
Black pants.

29:21.409 --> 29:25.359
Do you remember what kind of a car he
got into? Do you know where he was going?

29:26.581 --> 29:29.333
Excuse me for one moment.

29:29.417 --> 29:31.659
Baker, this is Agent Bauer.

29:31.753 --> 29:37.340
Syed Ali is still alive. We are looking for
a Middle Eastern man, wearing all black.

29:37.426 --> 29:39.999
I didn't get a make on the car.
Send out an APB.

29:40.095 --> 29:42.586
- We need to find him now.
- Copy.

29:42.681 --> 29:46.429
Kate, you said you came here
to help your sister. Who is she?

29:46.518 --> 29:49.139
Marie. Marie Warner.

29:51.022 --> 29:54.023
She was supposed to get married today.

29:58.780 --> 30:00.689
Tell Mike what you told me.

30:00.782 --> 30:06.406
There's a back-channel communications
network the CIA used to use, called OPCOM.

30:06.496 --> 30:08.987
It's been shut down for over 20 years.

30:09.082 --> 30:12.996
Last month, NSA was given orders
to resurrect it.

30:13.086 --> 30:17.036
It was an eyes-only order
issued by Roger Stanton.

30:22.721 --> 30:27.098
- I'm not sure that's enough.
- By itself, it's not.

30:27.184 --> 30:31.312
Unless Stanton used OPCOM to contact
Colonel Samuels in the last few hours.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.555
My source is checking on that now.

30:33.648 --> 30:39.402
Mike, call the Attorney General.
Start working on this from the legal side.

30:40.655 --> 30:45.650
If we find this connection,
we'll move on it, have Stanton arrested.

30:56.671 --> 31:01.629
I think we got a positive ID. Cross-reference
his prints with the name Paul Koplin.

31:01.718 --> 31:04.126
- CTU?
- Bauer. Put me through to Tony.

31:04.221 --> 31:06.546
Hold, please.

31:06.640 --> 31:09.213
- It's Tony. What's up?
- I'm still at the house.

31:09.309 --> 31:13.176
I just questioned the woman that
Ali was torturing for information.

31:13.271 --> 31:15.941
Her name is Kate Warner.
Run a background check.

31:16.024 --> 31:18.776
- Did you say Kate Warner?
- Yeah. Why?

31:18.860 --> 31:23.321
I had her family picked up this morning.
I was with her hours ago.

31:23.406 --> 31:26.324
- What's the connection?
- Reza Naiyeer,

31:26.409 --> 31:29.245
her sister's fiancé,
had dealings with Syed Ali.

31:29.329 --> 31:32.579
He's denying it.
He says it was the father, Bob Warner.

31:32.666 --> 31:36.794
Richards took Naiyeer to Bob Warner's
office to hack into his computer.

31:36.878 --> 31:40.164
I have Warner here with me right now.

31:40.257 --> 31:45.678
Jack, will Kate talk to you?
Cos her family's not cooperating.

31:45.762 --> 31:50.720
Yeah. But I gotta give her time. She's been
through hell. You should see this place.

31:52.477 --> 31:55.147
Jack, there's one more thing.

31:55.230 --> 31:56.309
What?

31:56.398 --> 32:00.098
The father, Bob Warner,
he freelances for the CIA.

32:04.322 --> 32:07.040
We're gonna have to
start from the beginning.

32:07.140 --> 32:08.865
You'll have to run everything again.

32:08.952 --> 32:13.448
Start connecting the dots. These people
are involved. You gotta find out how.

32:13.540 --> 32:17.538
- Get back to me when you've got anything.
- All right, you got it.

32:24.092 --> 32:28.137
Gentlemen, I need you to pack up.
I need the room.

32:29.306 --> 32:31.713
- Agent Baker?
- Baker here.

32:31.808 --> 32:34.382
- How's Miss Warner doing?
- Not so good.

32:35.020 --> 32:38.519
As soon as you think she's ready,
bring her down to the bathroom.

32:38.607 --> 32:41.014
Will do. Baker out.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.650
Those three dates and
anything the following week. Hold on.

32:47.741 --> 32:51.276
OK. Good. Let me know as soon
as you find something out. Thanks.

32:51.369 --> 32:53.077
- Sir?
- What have we got?

32:53.163 --> 32:56.746
- I found a way into the OPCOM channels.
- Good. Tunnel in.

32:56.833 --> 33:00.167
The problem is, the files
are pass code protected.

33:00.253 --> 33:03.457
We'll need someone internal
to open them. It'll take time.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.422
Hold. No, it's not.

33:05.509 --> 33:10.751
I just got the name of a deputy director
who's retired, but his code is still active.

33:10.847 --> 33:12.507
We could use that.

33:12.599 --> 33:16.383
Jean, could you hold on for a sec?
Uh-huh. Let's see.

33:19.314 --> 33:23.561
- Try this. It should work. I'm back.
- I'll head over to the OC and check it out.

33:23.652 --> 33:26.059
- Good.
- Oh, that's terrific.

33:26.154 --> 33:30.318
Jean, I'm gonna cross-reference these,
but I need you to stay in the office.

33:30.408 --> 33:33.575
- No problem.
- Right. OK. Thanks. Bye.

33:35.163 --> 33:38.947
I'm collecting the dates that
Samuels' office logged onto OPCOM.

33:39.042 --> 33:42.874
If Mike can trace Stanton's access,
we can look for a match.

33:42.963 --> 33:46.912
- That's great.
- If we have that, you'll have the proof.

33:47.008 --> 33:50.277
Stanton has a dozen
staff who share his code.

33:50.377 --> 33:51.172
How are we gonna pin it on him?

33:51.263 --> 33:56.803
There's a four-digit subcode that only belongs
to him. That's the one that'll nail him.

33:59.312 --> 34:01.305
- Sherry?
- Yes.

34:01.398 --> 34:04.399
You're doing an incredible job here today.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.436
Thank you.

34:08.822 --> 34:13.150
I'd forgotten how talented
you are at all this stuff.

34:13.243 --> 34:16.577
David, I've worked with you
for over 25 years.

34:17.746 --> 34:20.321
It had to rub off on me somehow.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.784
I'm glad you're here.

34:28.592 --> 34:31.509
I have always been here.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.630
You remember that.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.934
Yeah.

34:59.539 --> 35:01.781
All right. Call me if there's anything.

35:04.002 --> 35:07.205
- That was Barbara at the Warner office.
- What'd they find?

35:07.297 --> 35:11.924
Nothing yet. They're still going through
the records. Reza seems to be cooperating.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.718
This is driving me crazy.

35:13.804 --> 35:18.216
It doesn't make sense that Syed Ali has
a connection to this white-bread family.

35:18.308 --> 35:20.846
So you believe Bob Warner?

35:20.936 --> 35:26.274
There's nothing in his profile or behaviour
that suggests he's involved with terrorists.

35:26.358 --> 35:29.063
I agree. But look at the facts.

35:29.152 --> 35:32.402
There is a paper trail between
Warner Investments and Ali.

35:32.489 --> 35:34.647
Kate Warner was abducted for a reason.

35:34.741 --> 35:37.113
I know.

35:37.202 --> 35:42.908
Look, put together a list of all the managers
and directors of Bob Warner's company.

35:42.999 --> 35:45.953
- I want to widen the search a notch.
- Good idea.

35:46.044 --> 35:47.953
Anything else?

35:48.046 --> 35:49.790
Yeah.

35:49.881 --> 35:54.093
I was talking to Mason before, and...

35:56.638 --> 35:58.512
And?

35:58.598 --> 36:02.014
This is hardly the time,
but I don't know how much time we have,

36:02.102 --> 36:07.974
so... I just wanted you to know
that if you wanted to go out sometime...

36:08.066 --> 36:11.815
- Michelle...
- I just wanted you to know how I felt.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.896
No, Michelle...

36:16.116 --> 36:17.859
I feel the same way.

36:20.203 --> 36:23.619
I've just been keeping
my distance because...

36:25.167 --> 36:28.951
Because of what happened
between you and Nina?

36:31.590 --> 36:32.965
Yeah.

36:34.634 --> 36:37.552
So you think I just want you
for your information?

36:40.682 --> 36:44.976
So... what are we saying here, then?

36:46.062 --> 36:48.470
If we save LA from a nuclear bomb,

36:48.565 --> 36:52.645
then you and I can get together
for dinner and a movie? Is that it?

36:56.573 --> 37:00.072
- I'll get that list.
- Yeah, that's...

37:07.209 --> 37:13.543
Syed Ali left... after he killed Mr Koplin.

37:16.176 --> 37:19.177
They talked for a minute or two.

37:20.138 --> 37:23.139
They looked at me a couple of times.

37:26.478 --> 37:30.855
It was like...
like I wasn't important any more.

37:34.569 --> 37:36.776
They embraced, and he left.

37:40.951 --> 37:44.865
Did they say anything to each other
when he was leaving?

37:44.955 --> 37:49.083
Yes, but... they spoke so softly.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.741
And mostly in Arabic.

37:52.963 --> 37:56.296
Arabic? How can you be so sure?

37:56.383 --> 38:00.381
My family lived in Saudi Arabia
when I was younger.

38:00.470 --> 38:04.135
When my sister got engaged to Reza,
I picked it up again.

38:04.224 --> 38:08.685
Can you identify any words that they said?
Anything at all?

38:12.232 --> 38:16.360
Salat. They said "salat" several times.
It means prayer.

38:16.445 --> 38:21.153
But I couldn't really hear anything.
They were so soft.

38:21.241 --> 38:23.814
Baker, this is Jack. Get ahold of CTU.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.828
I want a list of every mosque
in a 15-mile radius.

38:26.913 --> 38:30.365
- Mosques?
- They talked about prayer before Ali left.

38:30.459 --> 38:32.996
- The time fits.
- Roger that.

38:36.047 --> 38:39.547
- Did that help?
- Yes.

38:39.634 --> 38:42.470
Yes, I think it did.

38:42.554 --> 38:43.834
OK.

38:43.930 --> 38:49.351
Kate, the normal protocol would be to transfer
you back to CTU for further debriefing.

38:51.730 --> 38:55.941
But the truth is, I don't know
what Syed Ali looks like.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.903
No one does, except for you.

39:02.365 --> 39:05.070
I need you to identify him for me.

39:15.337 --> 39:17.828
- Stanton.
- It's me.

39:19.174 --> 39:21.167
Excuse me.

39:32.270 --> 39:36.350
- You know better than to call me here.
- They know about OPCOM.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.564
- How?
- I told them.

39:38.652 --> 39:41.107
- What?!
- David had the bit between his teeth.

39:41.196 --> 39:43.652
He was gonna find out one way or another.

39:43.740 --> 39:47.608
This way, I get him trusting
me again, little by little.

39:47.702 --> 39:52.115
- What do we do now?
- They'll connect you to the plane.

39:52.207 --> 39:56.370
David's having an arrest warrant
drawn up as we speak.

39:56.461 --> 40:00.874
Stay the course, Roger. When this is over,
you'll have everything you want.

40:00.966 --> 40:04.750
While, in the meantime,
it's important that you don't talk.

40:04.845 --> 40:07.300
- Don't talk about you.
- That's right.

40:07.389 --> 40:10.259
It's more important than ever
that I stay in place.

40:10.350 --> 40:13.351
- How much time do I have?
- Not much.

40:21.153 --> 40:23.229
Hold on.

40:23.321 --> 40:26.821
Here's the shipping order.
It was entered last January.

40:26.908 --> 40:30.657
- Bob and I were both in Europe then.
- So he logged on from overseas.

40:30.745 --> 40:33.369
That's not possible. It's not international.

40:33.469 --> 40:36.914
But it didn't originate
from this terminal either.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.547
Somebody hacked in.

40:44.801 --> 40:50.637
Hold on. This can't be. I set up
this program on my own computer.

40:51.641 --> 40:56.268
- You said you were out of the country.
- I left my laptop here.

40:56.354 --> 40:59.558
Who else had access to it?

40:59.649 --> 41:01.607
Nobody.

41:05.405 --> 41:07.065
Except...

41:10.118 --> 41:11.577
Marie?

41:12.746 --> 41:15.747
I didn't expect you to find anything.

41:17.125 --> 41:18.952
I underestimated you.

41:49.783 --> 41:52.784
Well then, the last two years
have just been...

41:54.037 --> 41:57.287
It's just been an act, is that it?
I mean nothing to you?

42:03.630 --> 42:05.421
Huh?

42:05.507 --> 42:08.294
I don't understand. Say something, Marie!

42:09.428 --> 42:14.054
Reza... you really are very sweet.
