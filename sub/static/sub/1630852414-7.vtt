WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:07.716
How weird.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.844
Juan Carlos is always early.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.513
Maybe something came up.

00:14.014 --> 00:17.726
If that's the case,
why is he constantly checking his phone?

00:17.809 --> 00:18.643
Look.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.186
<i>She'll think something's up.</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:23.273
Text her back.
Tell her you're sick or something.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.900
I doubt she cares
if something's wrong with me.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.068
<i>He always does this.</i>

00:27.152 --> 00:31.614
Whenever he can't deal with something,
he magically comes down with something.

00:32.991 --> 00:33.908
Oh, Ana.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.578
WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU.
ARE YOU COMING, OR NOT?

00:39.998 --> 00:41.124
<i>Why go?</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:43.418
To hear her talk about her new beau?

00:43.501 --> 00:46.379
Sometimes the surpriser
becomes the surprised.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.339
It was your idea to serenade her.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.383
No, Juan Carlos.

00:51.134 --> 00:54.095
I told you to do something
to win her over,

00:54.179 --> 00:56.306
not to go stalking her in her own home.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.058
It's my house too.

00:58.141 --> 01:01.186
I'll never forgive Juan Carlos
for standing me up.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.688
That's one more thing you won't forgive.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.233
One more thing to add to the list.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.111
Ana, my next patient is waiting outside.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.237
I'm sorry.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.157
I'll pencil you in for next week.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.534
I'll call to confirm on Monday.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.036
-All right.
-See you.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.873
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:19.264 --> 02:21.432
What if I changed the background color?

02:23.434 --> 02:24.644
What are you looking at?

02:24.727 --> 02:27.272
Your eyes shine
when you talk about stuff you like.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.868
-What's wrong? Is she sick?
-No, she's fine.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.286
Why isn't she at daycare?

02:41.369 --> 02:43.413
Ferrán wants to open a daycare

02:43.496 --> 02:45.248
for all the moms here.

02:45.331 --> 02:48.960
So I obviously signed Regina up
for the pilot program, starting today.

02:49.043 --> 02:51.713
This means we can have her
really close to us.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.632
You didn't think to ask me first?

02:54.716 --> 02:57.552
Pablo, you're right. I'm sorry.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.680
-It just slipped my mind.
-Slipped your mind? Right.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.016
Don't get angry.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.685
Why don't you get involved?

03:05.768 --> 03:08.605
Help us iron out
the details of the pilot program.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.107
Will Ferrán agree,
or will it slip your mind?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.567
Come on, Pablo.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.194
Why wouldn't he agree?

03:14.694 --> 03:15.612
Just relax.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.743
<i>I'm sensing a really bad vibe.</i>

03:21.826 --> 03:23.912
It's coming from you.

03:24.495 --> 03:28.333
There's something up with you.
What's going on?

03:28.416 --> 03:30.585
I slept with Víctor on our trip!

03:31.711 --> 03:34.005
I knew something was up.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.132
What am I going to do, Mom?

03:36.758 --> 03:38.718
I don't want to lose my business.

03:38.801 --> 03:41.221
I don't want to let Mariana down again.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.972
We should know.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.893
Mixing business
and pleasure is very difficult.

03:46.976 --> 03:47.894
But listen,

03:47.977 --> 03:50.980
just don't tell Mariana,
and she won't be disappointed.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.732
-Is that your advice?
-Yes.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.859
Oh, Mom.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.571
I didn't need all your magic
to figure that out, but thanks.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.281
Seriously!

04:12.835 --> 04:13.920
What's wrong?

04:14.837 --> 04:15.797
It's just…

04:15.880 --> 04:18.758
I'm just not sure I'm ready yet.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.470
Ceci, your parents aren't home,
and Alta is watching soaps.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.681
I've never done it.

04:24.764 --> 04:28.977
But are you sure you want
your first time to be with me?

04:29.602 --> 04:30.478
-Yes.
-Yeah?

04:30.561 --> 04:31.729
Yes, of course.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.398
It's just, I don't know,

04:33.481 --> 04:38.069
I pictured my first time
a bit more romantic and special,

04:38.152 --> 04:40.363
not sneaking around in my room.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.115
All right, good point.

04:42.615 --> 04:46.411
I also want it to be special.
I'll find us a nice hotel and--

04:46.494 --> 04:48.746
A hotel? What's special about a hotel?

04:49.330 --> 04:51.082
So what do you suggest?

04:51.165 --> 04:53.584
Just let me take care of it.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.921
I promise I'll find the perfect place.

05:08.766 --> 05:09.767
<i>Surprise!</i>

05:09.851 --> 05:12.186
Coffee and tiramisu from Piccolo Forno.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.565
Thanks, I'll save it for later.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.151
I'm already behind schedule.

05:18.651 --> 05:19.527
Okay.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.530
Is there anything I can do to help?

05:22.613 --> 05:25.158
No, thanks, I've got it.
I'm getting into a rhythm.

05:25.241 --> 05:27.285
I'll manage. You know what, Víctor?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.830
What happened on the trip was a mistake.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.875
It was the heat of the moment,

05:33.958 --> 05:36.377
and we shouldn't mix things up.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.339
I feel nothing for you, nor you for me.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.007
So there's really no point.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.177
Okay, let's forget it.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.929
Will this affect the business?

05:47.013 --> 05:48.097
Not really.

05:48.598 --> 05:52.477
See you tomorrow at the gym
for the face mask launch?

05:52.560 --> 05:54.354
Sure, I'll take the tiramisu.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.398
-We don't want it to go to waste.
-Yes, great.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.734
-Yeah, can't mess with my diet.
-Okay.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.446
<i>These toys are incredible.</i>

06:03.529 --> 06:06.741
If I'm this fascinated,
the babies will be so distracted.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.576
It's not about distracting them.

06:08.659 --> 06:12.747
You need to hire professionals
who will stimulate and engage them.

06:12.830 --> 06:13.706
Of course, Pablo.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.209
We're setting up some TV sets
to play cartoons.

06:16.292 --> 06:19.045
Don't worry about the budget.
I'll take care of it.

06:19.128 --> 06:22.131
Sorry, but I don't want my baby
to watch cartoons all day.

06:22.215 --> 06:26.094
Her emotional needs must be met
effectively and affectively.

06:26.177 --> 06:31.265
It's important we hire people
trained in early development.

06:31.349 --> 06:35.937
Maybe we moms could volunteer
to keep the service free.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.941
That's a good idea.
I'll cancel the TV order.

06:40.024 --> 06:40.942
Excuse me.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.277
Goodbye, Koala.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.322
It's Penguin.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.909
Thanks for having my back.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.702
That's why I wanted your input

06:51.786 --> 06:53.871
because you're a great dad.

06:53.955 --> 06:57.333
You're also a brilliant man,
though you sometimes forget.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.836
You don't need to be that brilliant

06:59.919 --> 07:02.755
to know that screens
don't make good babysitters.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.049
Isn't that right, Penguin?

07:05.133 --> 07:06.717
"I don't like screens."

07:07.218 --> 07:10.596
I better run. I have a big meeting
with an investor for my video game.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.684
I just need to tweak the design.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.228
If everything goes well,

07:17.311 --> 07:19.981
I'll start making real money
instead of always being broke.

07:20.064 --> 07:20.940
Congrats.

07:21.023 --> 07:24.402
Are you ready to deal with investors?

07:24.485 --> 07:25.903
I've never been more ready.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.488
Fingers crossed!

07:27.989 --> 07:30.867
-Fingers crossed!
-That's right.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.869
Ma'am, I'm glad you're here.

07:32.952 --> 07:36.831
If this is about the gardener,
save your gripes for later.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.916
It's not a gripe. It's a problem.

07:39.750 --> 07:43.004
I found these in Miss Ceci's trousers.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.883
Ceci, can you explain these?

07:47.925 --> 07:50.761
-Those aren't mine.
-They were in your trousers.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.224
Honey,

07:55.725 --> 07:58.311
we haven't had the talk,
and it's a little concerning.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.106
Sex is natural.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.649
-And if you're--
-Mom.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.945
I found them in Dad's apartment,
and I'm using them for a school project.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.072
<i>You didn't go to therapy.</i>

08:10.156 --> 08:12.241
I wasn't feeling well, Ana.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.701
I'm sure it was serious.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.871
Why do you have condoms in your apartment?

08:17.872 --> 08:20.625
I don't know. Those aren't mine.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.001
At least be discreet.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.254
Don't leave them lying around
for the kids to find.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.798
I'm telling you they're not mine.
I mean it.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.717
I'd never buy that brand.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.887
Now he's a condom expert. Good for you.

08:32.970 --> 08:36.098
At least I hope you used one
when you asked Ferrán over

08:36.182 --> 08:39.143
to frolic in our bed.
Talk about being discreet.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.063
-What are you talking about?
-I saw you with him.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.689
Are you spying on me?

08:43.773 --> 08:46.359
No, I was here because--

08:46.442 --> 08:48.361
We laid down boundaries.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.363
You have no right to come here.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.907
What do I have to do
for you to leave me alone?

08:52.990 --> 08:55.743
Wasn't it enough
to encroach on my workspace?

08:55.826 --> 08:58.371
Now you're spying on me in my own home.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.374
-It's our house.
-It's mine because I live here.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.668
You can't come back whenever you please.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.796
We should get a divorce
so you get it through your head.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.631
You're giving me no choice.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.426
<i>I can't talk to my mom about that.</i>

09:12.510 --> 09:16.514
It must be hard for her
to realize her little girl is growing up.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.599
I think you should talk to her.

09:18.683 --> 09:22.603
I'm not asking my mom to help me
find a place to lose my virginity.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.689
All right, fair enough.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.483
Do you remember our first time?

09:27.567 --> 09:28.901
Yes, at the aquarium.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.112
There was this huge fish tank

09:31.195 --> 09:33.864
and multi-colored lights. It was amazing.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.367
Isn't that too risky?

09:37.118 --> 09:39.036
Only if you jump into the shark tank.

09:40.413 --> 09:44.000
The aquarium's night guard
is my dad's driver's brother.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.002
For a small fee,

09:46.085 --> 09:48.963
he lets horny teens
set up their dates there.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.841
If you're completely sure you're ready,

09:51.924 --> 09:53.467
that's the perfect spot.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.012
Will you guys help me?

09:56.095 --> 09:57.179
Of course!

09:57.263 --> 09:59.724
But you have to tell your mom first.

09:59.807 --> 10:00.891
Promise me.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.518
I promise.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.561
<i>I saw it coming.</i>

10:03.644 --> 10:07.898
You and Ana should've gotten divorced
a long time ago.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.443
It's been a while
since I've seen you happy.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.613
You were scared to take that step.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.323
I'm glad Ana finally did.

10:15.406 --> 10:18.075
I just want my family back.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.911
-I don't know how to live like this.
-Can I finish that?

10:22.455 --> 10:25.291
Juanqui, your family
will always be your family.

10:25.374 --> 10:28.085
What you need right now
is to find a good lawyer.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.170
Igor!

10:30.338 --> 10:32.632
Stop by the gym later,
and we'll talk to him.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.926
<i>I'm overwhelmed.</i>

10:36.010 --> 10:38.554
The designer is sending
the changes I asked for,

10:38.638 --> 10:41.057
but Manolo is hounding me

10:41.140 --> 10:42.683
over a task he needs done.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.769
-Need me to help?
-Yes.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.605
Help me crunch some numbers.

10:47.688 --> 10:51.442
Thanks. I'll pop over to see Regis
and meet you back in my office.

10:51.525 --> 10:52.360
Yeah.

10:53.027 --> 10:53.903
Thanks.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.033
Where is Regina?

10:59.116 --> 11:00.743
Mr. Ferrán picked her up.

11:03.537 --> 11:04.830
Where's Mariana?

11:04.914 --> 11:07.166
I don't know.
She asked me to watch the koala.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.834
It's Penguin.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.419
Koalas are cuter.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.463
-No way. Hand her over.
-No!

11:12.546 --> 11:14.882
She asked me to watch her, so…

11:15.466 --> 11:17.343
-Isn't that right, Mariana?
-What?

11:18.010 --> 11:19.178
Where were you?

11:19.261 --> 11:21.764
Why'd you leave my daughter with this guy?

11:21.847 --> 11:24.100
You were busy with your video game.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.851
I didn't want to bother you.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.979
-Aren't those toys wrong for her age?
-The koala loves them.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.731
Stop calling her koala!

11:30.815 --> 11:34.485
Pablo, koalas are cute.
What's wrong with him calling her that?

11:37.405 --> 11:39.532
I can ask Rodrigo if they're his.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.076
I can't believe you're blaming him.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.202
He's a little boy.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.329
Haven't you noticed his voice changed?

11:45.413 --> 11:47.123
We all grow up eventually.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.165
Except for you.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.292
The condoms are irrelevant.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.627
The issue here is us.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.756
-Just go. I don't want to talk.
-Ana, I'm trying to help.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.300
If you really want to help,
just leave me alone.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.594
It's your fault our family
is breaking apart.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.472
My kids hide stuff from me.
I don't know who they are anymore.

12:03.973 --> 12:07.143
-We should talk. Divorce isn't--
-We've nothing to talk about.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.478
It's over between us.

12:12.773 --> 12:14.483
<i>This sucks!</i>

12:14.567 --> 12:16.694
Would you be interested in trying out--

12:17.278 --> 12:18.821
See? No one's stopping.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.740
Víctor was supposed to help us.

12:20.823 --> 12:21.949
He was supposed to.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.118
Everything okay between you?

12:24.201 --> 12:27.747
I told him I didn't want us
to mix things up. And now, look.

12:27.830 --> 12:28.664
You did what?

12:28.748 --> 12:32.877
That I didn't want the business to suffer
if things went sour between us.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.797
-Out of respect for you, my partner.
-More than partners, friends.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.341
There's no reason for things to go wrong.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.719
And if they do,
we'll figure something out.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.514
Check it out, girlfriend.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.516
Double trouble.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.186
-How are you, Juan Carlos?
-Hi.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.355
-This is a nice surprise.
-Víctor told me about your venture.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.566
-How's it going?
-Not great.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.693
No one's stepping up.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.489
We just need to get our first customer,
and maybe others will follow.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.241
I'm early to meet with someone.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.744
-May I?
-Yes, of course!

13:06.827 --> 13:07.953
Make yourself comfortable.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.415
-Just relax.
-That feels nice.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.752
It's probably a little cool,
but you'll be so moisturized.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.128
It's so nice.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.839
-Close your eyes.
-Sure.

13:18.923 --> 13:22.092
That's it, just relax.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.844
<i>What's with him?</i>

13:23.928 --> 13:26.597
It even bothers him
that Ferrán calls her Koala.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.182
Koala is so cute.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.351
Right? I said the same thing.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.186
At least he's not spying on you.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.771
Is Juan Carlos doing that?

13:33.854 --> 13:35.981
He went by my house the other day

13:36.607 --> 13:38.108
when you and Ferrán were there.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.694
I'm sick of him invading my spaces.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.279
I'm sick of this too.

13:42.947 --> 13:47.743
Frankly, I really like Ferrán.
I'd like us to try a serious relationship.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.997
But if Pablo keeps acting like this,
it'll be a nightmare.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.083
I think Pablo feels threatened.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.586
He must hate Ferrán
spending so much time with Regina.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.755
Ferrán isn't trying to take his place.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.382
We've talked about it.

14:01.465 --> 14:04.552
What Pablo needs to do
is spend time with Ferrán.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.470
Get to know him.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.974
They might just end up becoming friends.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.439
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, you made it.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.607
I can't believe it.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.568
You're a Diablos fan?

14:21.151 --> 14:23.696
Don't tell me you're a Tigres fan. No!

14:24.196 --> 14:26.574
I can lend you my hat
if you're embarrassed.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.200
My dad gave me this hat,

14:28.284 --> 14:29.910
and I'm giving it to Regina.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.871
It'll be our little family tradition.

14:32.454 --> 14:35.708
You're making a family tradition
out of mediocrity?

14:35.791 --> 14:36.792
Cheers to that.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.502
Guys, let's watch

14:39.211 --> 14:40.212
that.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.172
-Do you like surfing?
-No.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.801
I really like the sea,
though with a healthy dose of respect.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.263
-Respect? It terrifies you.
-Oh, come on.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.181
Remember the pool in Valle de Bravo?

14:51.765 --> 14:55.769
That was so embarrassing.
I had to confess that I couldn't swim.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.522
It wasn't that bad.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.233
That's my house in Tulum.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.694
We could take Regina during spring break.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.946
I'd love to take Regis to the beach,

15:06.030 --> 15:10.200
but between work and being broke,
I haven't been able to.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.160
Let's do it.

15:14.079 --> 15:14.914
What's wrong?

15:14.997 --> 15:17.249
I'd have to talk to Pablo first.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.585
I'm sure he'll be fine with it.

15:19.668 --> 15:20.502
<i>Are you nuts?</i>

15:20.586 --> 15:23.672
A few days ago, you weren't sure
about Ferrán meeting Regina.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.674
Now you want to take her
on vacation with him?

15:26.175 --> 15:27.885
You're being illogical, Mariana.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.971
Pablo, what's the matter?
You don't like me dating Ferrán?

15:31.055 --> 15:35.434
No, we already talked about that.
You can date anyone you want.

15:35.517 --> 15:39.688
Well, I want to go away with him
to get to know him better.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.524
Fine, but the penguin doesn't have to go.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.526
Go away with him if you want,

15:45.027 --> 15:46.779
but I won't let you take Regina.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.491
<i>It's not easy.</i>

15:51.158 --> 15:52.618
I don't know what to do.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.162
I tried to talk to her,
but she shut me down.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.374
What's up with you?
Why didn't you come to the gym?

15:58.457 --> 16:00.209
You left me alone with the lawyer.

16:00.751 --> 16:01.627
I was there,

16:02.169 --> 16:04.421
but I saw you enjoying your face mask.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.883
Did you get a treatment
just to flirt with Tere?

16:08.467 --> 16:11.637
Oh, that's right!
You're trying to win Ana back.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.681
Víctor, what are you talking about?

16:14.264 --> 16:16.767
-I'm not interested in Tere.
-Well, neither am I.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.395
Actually, I have to go.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.896
Víctor, come on!

16:21.647 --> 16:24.608
I've never needed you more.
Look at all I'm going through.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.444
Juan Carlos, I have important stuff to do.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.950
<i>He's just jealous.</i>

16:33.033 --> 16:34.868
Jealousy clouds the mind.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.162
How dare he say he won't allow it?

16:37.246 --> 16:40.374
Who died and made him king
of allowing things?

16:40.457 --> 16:42.167
You've both moved on.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.461
He can't stop you
just because he's jealous.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.630
You must stand your ground.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.466
That's how I got Juan Carlos to let me be.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.676
You're divorcing him?

16:50.759 --> 16:53.595
I feel he's the reason
my kids are pulling away from me.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.806
Trusting him again won't be easy.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.766
It'll take some time, but…

16:59.143 --> 17:00.602
One day at a time.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.689
I wish I had your clarity.

17:03.772 --> 17:04.982
I've no idea what to do.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.276
You have to go to Tulum with Ferrán.

17:07.776 --> 17:10.821
Besides, you have two months
to change Pablo's mind.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.990
<i>You can't let your guard down.</i>

17:13.073 --> 17:16.201
You have to focus on the details
to mount a precise attack.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.163
Laura, Ana's attorney,

17:19.663 --> 17:21.206
is my ex-wife.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.709
If I'm a royal eagle,

17:23.792 --> 17:28.172
she's a sharp-taloned vulture
whose beak will devour you.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.883
This isn't reassuring at all.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.468
Don't worry, Juan Carlos.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.220
This is a war, but we'll win it.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.015
We need to find out what Laura has done,

17:38.599 --> 17:40.059
so we can be ready.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.355
Now, that's a nice house! Look at that.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.648
Who cares?

17:46.732 --> 17:49.651
That big house doesn't mean
Mariana can take the penguin.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.487
Have you seen it?

17:52.529 --> 17:53.864
I mean, it's pretty cool.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.366
I don't even care.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.619
-Yeah, right.
-You wish.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.455
-Not it.
-Not it.

18:06.877 --> 18:07.711
What's wrong?

18:08.754 --> 18:12.132
My brother is being a jerk,
and I need someone to talk to.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.972
All right, guys, the adults need to talk.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.390
Can you clear out?

18:24.311 --> 18:25.854
<i>Ana wants a divorce.</i>

18:26.605 --> 18:27.481
No way.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.900
Why? What happened?

18:31.110 --> 18:35.114
She's moved on.
She doesn't want a life with me.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.742
I'm not sure, but I know Ferrán
had something to do with her decision.

18:38.826 --> 18:39.660
Ferrán?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.539
I saw him leaving my house
the other night.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.249
But Ferrán is dating Mariana.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.461
Are you sure about that?
I saw them holding hands.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.505
You got it wrong.

18:51.588 --> 18:54.216
He wants to take Mariana
and Regina to Tulum.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.386
What's this nonsense about
him taking them to Tulum?

18:57.469 --> 18:59.763
He has a huge house in Tulum,

18:59.847 --> 19:02.057
and Mariana is always taking his side.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.601
I don't want to miss
Regina's first trip to the beach.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.271
That's a father-daughter thing.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.188
Exactly!

19:08.272 --> 19:11.066
You can't let that guy walk all over you.

19:11.150 --> 19:15.612
Will he also take her to Disney
and skiing for the first time?

19:15.696 --> 19:19.116
Will he pay for a Europe trip
when she takes a gap year?

19:19.199 --> 19:22.870
No shit. If you let this go on,
he'll give her away at the altar.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.748
Pablo, you need to make things
really clear to Mariana.

19:27.291 --> 19:31.336
I had to hire a lawyer
because Ana is ruthless,

19:32.171 --> 19:33.881
and you have to do the same.

19:35.382 --> 19:39.052
You have to get a court ruling
to assert your rights as a dad.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.725
Let me offer my services.

19:44.808 --> 19:48.520
I offer divorces that guarantee
your manhood, self-esteem, and dignity

19:48.604 --> 19:49.855
will stay intact.

19:50.939 --> 19:55.694
Thank you, but I already hired
the services of an attorney,

19:55.777 --> 19:56.820
Igor Santamarina.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.031
Professor Laura's ex-husband?

19:59.114 --> 20:01.950
That guy lost his dog in the divorce!

20:02.034 --> 20:02.951
Conrado,

20:03.035 --> 20:05.621
Igor is the best family lawyer.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.335
I can help you, right?

20:12.336 --> 20:14.171
Please, you can't afford Igor.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.426
Maybe Igor can handle both of our cases.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.720
It may be for the best.

20:21.803 --> 20:22.721
Okay.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.225
-I don't know.
-Just think about it.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.019
I want what's best for you, for everyone.

20:29.645 --> 20:33.106
As soon as Juan Carlos
got his facial treatment,

20:33.190 --> 20:35.734
a ton of guys lined up, and we made bank.

20:35.817 --> 20:40.113
You and Juan Carlos can't seem
to stop talking about each other.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.824
Since when is your brother
a touchy subject?

20:43.784 --> 20:45.911
Ever since you broke it off with me

20:46.662 --> 20:48.330
to clear the way for him.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.582
What are you talking about? Clear the way?

20:50.666 --> 20:52.459
I saw you flirting at the gym.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.710
I'm not an idiot, Tere.

20:55.796 --> 20:59.591
You know what? Yes, you are an idiot.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.386
For your information,
if it hadn't been for him,

21:02.469 --> 21:04.429
our product launch would've failed.

21:04.513 --> 21:08.392
I wanted to see you today
to apologize for how I acted.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.727
Sleeping with you wasn't a mistake,

21:11.687 --> 21:13.814
but maybe I was wrong to think

21:14.856 --> 21:16.900
we could have something serious.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.569
<i>I'd rather stay out of it,</i>

21:19.653 --> 21:21.238
but you're worrying me.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.407
It's not about Mariana.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.325
I don't mind her dating Ferrán,

21:25.409 --> 21:28.120
but I don't like Regina
being around him so much.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.080
This must be hard for you as a dad,

21:30.163 --> 21:32.749
but I can tell you're spiraling.

21:32.833 --> 21:36.503
Your energy should be focused
on your video game presentation,

21:36.586 --> 21:38.171
not arguing with Ferrán.

21:38.255 --> 21:41.717
-But Mariana--
-She's your baby's mom. She knows best.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.636
Pablo, I want your opinion.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.263
It's also available in yellow.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.766
I'm not sure which one
Regina would like better.

21:49.850 --> 21:53.437
I should go check if Ana needs anything.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.689
It's for the trip to Tulum.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.816
Thanks for letting us take her.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.277
Hell no. I'm taking Regina
on spring break.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.446
You're not ruining my plans with my kid.

22:02.529 --> 22:05.532
Well, I'm not letting you
ruin my plans with Mariana.

22:05.615 --> 22:06.825
Why are you so spiteful?

22:12.164 --> 22:14.499
Security!

22:17.085 --> 22:18.879
I don't know what to say to her

22:18.962 --> 22:21.381
or why I'm having these feelings.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.760
All I know is I thought I saw her
flirting with Juan Carlos.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.803
My mind kept picturing them together,

22:26.887 --> 22:29.389
like when they had their affair.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.767
-I just lost it.
-It's not easy.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.936
-No, it's not.
-But that's over now.

22:35.771 --> 22:36.980
It's long over.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.940
Find a way to get past it.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.442
It takes a lot of

22:41.443 --> 22:42.277
courage.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.821
You have plenty of that.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.073
You think?

22:46.698 --> 22:48.200
I'm sure.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.871
Kids, I don't want us
to get into an argument.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.831
To show how serious I am,

22:54.915 --> 22:58.210
I'll toss these in the trash
and never bring it up again.

23:04.883 --> 23:08.595
I know things have been difficult
since your dad and I separated,

23:08.678 --> 23:12.641
but I want you to know
you can trust me with anything.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.812
Do any of you have anything to share?

23:23.193 --> 23:24.528
<i>I can't trust you.</i>

23:24.611 --> 23:27.114
You were going to take her
without my permission!

23:28.115 --> 23:29.950
Pablo, that's not true.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.327
We had a deal.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.038
No, we didn't.

23:35.122 --> 23:38.792
We didn't even finish talking about it
because you went crazy.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.294
Only because Ferrán
is a bad example for Regina.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.712
Look who's talking!

23:42.796 --> 23:44.798
The guy who almost knifed him.

23:44.881 --> 23:48.844
It wasn't a knife. It was a pen.
Who do you take me for?

23:48.927 --> 23:52.305
I don't know.
It's like I don't even know you.

23:52.389 --> 23:56.268
I don't get why you don't want Regina
to have cool experiences.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.562
Why would you do that to your daughter?

23:58.645 --> 24:01.523
Her new experiences
should be with me, not with that jerk.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.942
I want her first beach trip
to be with her dad.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.320
Wait, Pablo.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.114
<i>It took me by surprise.</i>

24:09.197 --> 24:11.825
Sorry, I didn't know I was so jealous.

24:11.908 --> 24:15.078
I mean, it's not exactly easy
considering your history.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.289
Forget about all that. It was stupid.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.040
I want to apologize

24:20.000 --> 24:24.296
and thank you for trying out
the facial treatment.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.882
-You're serious about Tere, right?
-Well, yeah.

24:26.965 --> 24:30.218
But I messed up.
I'm afraid I lost her forever.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.013
If you're sure about your feelings,

24:33.096 --> 24:34.639
you shouldn't give up.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.766
Is that right? What should I do, then?

24:38.602 --> 24:40.479
Someone once told me

24:40.562 --> 24:43.899
to use my dorky, old-fashioned charms.

24:45.192 --> 24:48.111
It didn't help one bit,
but at least you'll know.

24:49.988 --> 24:52.365
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.993
Hi, can I have your IDs?

24:55.076 --> 24:57.412
-They're with me. They need badges.
-Sure.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.749
Sorry, sir. You've been banned.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.502
There must be some mistake.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.670
-Can you check again?
-Of course.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.214
Go tell him.

25:09.424 --> 25:10.634
Pablo,

25:10.717 --> 25:13.386
I'm sorry,
but after your violent outburst,

25:13.470 --> 25:15.305
Ferrán banned you from the premises.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.224
Those are his orders.

25:20.810 --> 25:23.730
I'll show you a violent outburst
if I can't get to my office.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.028
Pablo, let's reschedule

25:30.654 --> 25:32.030
once you settle all this.

25:32.113 --> 25:35.534
-I'll clear it up in a minute.
-Pablo, call my office.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.086
You can't go in!

25:47.963 --> 25:49.881
That's a violent outburst, asshole!

25:50.966 --> 25:52.801
-What's wrong with you?
-Hey!

25:54.678 --> 25:56.930
<i>No fucking way. That's messed up.</i>

25:57.013 --> 26:00.141
First he tries to steal your kid.
Now he ruins your business.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.061
Mariana doesn't even realize
what a jerk he is.

26:03.144 --> 26:04.646
Maybe Juan Carlos is right,

26:04.729 --> 26:07.691
and your only option
is to file for shared custody.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.235
She could try to keep you
from seeing her, man.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.279
<i>What happened, Ferrán?</i>

26:12.362 --> 26:14.573
You banned Pablo from the co-work space?

26:14.656 --> 26:17.784
I'm sick and tired of him
and his outbursts.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.370
You can't do that to him.
He's my baby's dad.

26:20.453 --> 26:23.999
What else could I do?
He attacked me with a pen!

26:24.499 --> 26:26.501
And now he punched me.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.295
I can't let him in.

26:28.378 --> 26:31.506
You just ruined his chance to succeed.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.385
He had a big meeting with some investors.

26:35.885 --> 26:38.847
He didn't attack you with a pen.
He just deflated the whale.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.640
I'm sorry.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.226
I didn't know that meeting
was so important to him.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.437
Who are the investors?

26:45.520 --> 26:48.356
I'll call and explain it was a mix-up.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.483
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.111
What can I do to fix this?

26:53.194 --> 26:56.364
-Nothing, just leave it.
-Wait, Mariana.

26:58.366 --> 26:59.200
I'm sorry.

26:59.701 --> 27:02.287
Why don't we go to Valle de Bravo
for the weekend?

27:02.370 --> 27:06.833
We'll forget about Tulum
and the stupid inflatable whale.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.919
I just want us to be together.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.172
I'll think about it, okay?

27:12.922 --> 27:13.923
Okay.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.345
<i>Pablo shouldn't have attacked him.</i>

27:19.721 --> 27:20.597
I know.

27:20.680 --> 27:23.475
I just never imagined
things would escalate like this.

27:23.558 --> 27:26.936
I guess Pablo
is scared of losing his daughter.

27:28.563 --> 27:31.107
I don't know if I should go with Ferrán.

27:31.191 --> 27:35.111
I have Regina this weekend,
so I don't need Pablo's blessing.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.113
-But--
-I think you know what to do.

27:38.281 --> 27:41.368
Give it a try. If it doesn't work,
you'll deal with it then.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.995
You deserve to be happy.

27:47.248 --> 27:49.834
At least someone is happy today.

27:51.002 --> 27:54.339
I hope Ceci really enjoys
her night with Darío.

27:54.422 --> 27:55.256
Ceci?

27:56.466 --> 27:58.301
Enjoy what? With whom?

27:58.385 --> 28:01.012
Ceci promised she'd talk to you.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.055
About what?

28:02.138 --> 28:03.932
That she's ready for her first time

28:04.015 --> 28:06.393
and needed help finding a place.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.353
That's what the condoms were for.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.397
-What condoms?
-That little brat!

28:11.106 --> 28:12.774
Take me to Ceci. Let's go!

28:14.818 --> 28:16.528
<i>Be ready for the worst scenario.</i>

28:17.028 --> 28:20.031
Ana hasn't retained Laura yet.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.533
But we must be ready.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.660
Where are you living?

28:24.577 --> 28:26.538
I had to find an apartment.

28:27.622 --> 28:29.749
That was a mistake, Juan Carlos.

28:29.833 --> 28:30.875
Now,

28:30.959 --> 28:33.420
we have to get ahead of Laura's arguments.

28:33.503 --> 28:35.964
You have to follow my instructions

28:36.047 --> 28:38.133
to the letter.

28:38.216 --> 28:39.050
Understand?

28:48.309 --> 28:49.185
<i>An aquarium?</i>

28:49.269 --> 28:51.020
How could you send her there?

28:51.104 --> 28:54.232
Ana, please. We can't just show up.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.900
But she's not picking up.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.777
There's probably a reason for that.

28:59.529 --> 29:00.739
You're not helping.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.949
Ramón, please drive faster.

29:09.956 --> 29:10.874
Thanks!

29:13.543 --> 29:15.420
Pablo, you took my advice.

29:15.962 --> 29:19.090
Yeah, I thought about it a lot,
and I think you're right.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.676
It's best to let the court sort this out.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.845
I'm just tagging along.

29:23.928 --> 29:26.389
-Working pro bro-no, obviously.
-Pro bono.

29:26.473 --> 29:30.435
No, pro bro-no.
Because I'm doing it to help my bro!

29:31.728 --> 29:33.021
It'll be fine, Pablo.

29:33.938 --> 29:35.440
You're doing the right thing.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.118
Good evening!

29:47.911 --> 29:48.870
This way.

29:50.747 --> 29:54.042
INBURSA AQUARIUM

29:55.585 --> 29:59.130
-Yes?
-Good evening. I'm Elena's friend.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.508
The hall is occupied right now,

30:01.591 --> 30:03.343
but they won't be long.

30:03.968 --> 30:06.179
Hey! You can't go in, ma'am.

30:09.349 --> 30:10.308
Ceci!

30:10.892 --> 30:13.269
Mom? What are you doing here?

30:13.353 --> 30:15.104
You're not answering!

30:15.188 --> 30:16.356
I'm with Darío.

30:16.439 --> 30:19.150
Ceci, let's not piss her off.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.068
What?

30:25.198 --> 30:26.324
Excuse me, ma'am.

30:27.742 --> 30:29.619
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

30:29.702 --> 30:31.496
Why won't you let me live my life?

30:32.914 --> 30:35.959
You told her, didn't you? I trusted you.

30:36.042 --> 30:37.710
You promised you'd talk to her.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.463
I'm your mother, not Mariana.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.091
Why didn't you tell me?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.510
I asked you to.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.347
You're the one who should trust me.

30:50.014 --> 30:53.101
You should be grateful
I have a friend like Mariana.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.728
It's like having two moms.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.647
Just like Regina and Valentina.

30:58.189 --> 31:01.401
Ana, please forgive me.
I never meant to push you out.

31:02.443 --> 31:03.653
I'm the one who's sorry.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.364
I'm acting just like Pablo.

31:07.490 --> 31:08.449
I was jealous.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.034
Jealous as a mom.

31:11.578 --> 31:14.664
Lately, with all this stuff
between your dad and I--

31:14.747 --> 31:15.707
Mom.

31:16.791 --> 31:18.793
You'll always be my mother.

31:23.506 --> 31:26.843
If I'd told my mom something like this,
I'd be in a convent.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.763
I want things to be different between us.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.391
I want you to trust me.

31:33.474 --> 31:35.435
I want us to be able to talk.

31:35.518 --> 31:36.352
Mom,

31:37.061 --> 31:40.273
I don't think I'm ready
to hear about your sexual history.

31:40.356 --> 31:43.985
I didn't tell my mom either
when I lost my virginity,

31:44.611 --> 31:47.196
but she did tell me all about hers.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.950
I want you to know something.

31:51.034 --> 31:52.493
If being with him

31:53.369 --> 31:54.495
makes you happy,

31:54.579 --> 31:55.997
that's all that matters.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.629
<i>One, two, three…</i>

32:03.212 --> 32:07.050
<i>We're here to deliver a message of love</i>

32:07.133 --> 32:11.596
<i>For a woman who's stolen a heart</i>

32:11.679 --> 32:14.849
<i>This is the story of a brother</i>

32:14.933 --> 32:20.146
<i>Who fell in love with a black sheep</i>

32:20.229 --> 32:23.358
Can you sing it again? It's for her.

32:25.985 --> 32:29.572
<i>We're here to deliver a message of love</i>

32:29.656 --> 32:34.202
<i>For a woman who's stolen a heart</i>

32:34.285 --> 32:38.247
<i>The sheep has taken a liking to my heart</i>

32:38.331 --> 32:42.043
<i>If she promises to take care of it</i>
<i>I'll gladly let her have it</i>

32:42.627 --> 32:44.087
Keep singing, guys!

32:44.629 --> 32:48.091
<i>We're here to deliver a message of love</i>

32:48.174 --> 32:53.054
<i>For a woman who's stolen a heart…</i>

32:53.137 --> 32:54.097
Hi.

32:54.847 --> 32:58.893
I know it's going to be a while
before things settle with Pablo,

33:00.061 --> 33:02.981
and I know you've tried your best

33:03.898 --> 33:06.651
to make me happy.

33:06.734 --> 33:09.821
So let's go to Valle de Bravo.
The three of us.

33:24.627 --> 33:25.545
What's this?

33:27.505 --> 33:28.506
Juan Carlos.

33:29.507 --> 33:32.051
Good night, both of you.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.433
What are you doing here?

33:39.100 --> 33:41.310
Ana, this is my house too.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.771
I'm not falling for your tricks.

33:44.355 --> 33:47.817
-What are you talking about?
-My lawyer explained everything.

33:48.568 --> 33:52.238
You want me out
so you can claim I abandoned the home.

33:53.823 --> 33:55.241
I'm here to stay.

35:10.149 --> 35:14.821
