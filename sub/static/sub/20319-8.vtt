WEBVTT

00:08.319 --> 00:10.554
So how did it
go with Sandy?

00:10.621 --> 00:12.421
It was nice, it
was really nice.

00:12.489 --> 00:14.923
Yeah, that's it?
What happened?

00:14.991 --> 00:17.025
I don't want to jinx it by
talking about it, we just went

00:17.094 --> 00:20.229
out for a couple drinks,
and I walked her home.

00:20.297 --> 00:21.997
Ah, you kissed her, huh?

00:22.065 --> 00:23.165
Don't read my mind please.

00:23.233 --> 00:24.233
I'm not reading your mind.

00:24.301 --> 00:25.634
All you had to say was no.

00:25.702 --> 00:26.969
If you had said no, it
would have been obvious,

00:27.036 --> 00:28.203
but you didn't.

00:28.270 --> 00:29.270
Eyes on the road please.

00:29.338 --> 00:31.872
- So you kissed her.
- Eyes on the road, please.

00:32.975 --> 00:34.275
Yeah, it kind
of came out of nowhere,

00:34.343 --> 00:36.578
but she's a pretty
cool chick actually.

00:36.645 --> 00:37.878
She's smart, she's pretty,
she's funny,

00:37.946 --> 00:38.879
she makes more
money than you...

00:38.947 --> 00:40.448
Okay.

00:40.516 --> 00:41.749
You guys are like
the perfect couple.

00:41.817 --> 00:43.350
Ok, I just said
don't jinx it please.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.252
I'm not.

00:44.253 --> 00:48.255

Hello?

01:03.937 --> 01:06.005
Gotta turn him over now.

01:08.775 --> 01:11.512
No vital signs,

- Hey!

01:48.579 --> 01:49.979
Good work man.

01:50.914 --> 01:52.348
What have we got?

01:52.416 --> 01:55.185
CTAS 1, male, 53,
collapsed, asystole on scene,

01:55.252 --> 01:56.219
we brought him back.

01:56.287 --> 01:57.220
We're set up in Bay 2.

01:57.288 --> 01:59.255
Bay 2? Alright.

02:04.126 --> 02:06.595
Line's in the left AC,
still unconscious,

02:06.663 --> 02:08.530
no known history,
no medical alert.

02:08.598 --> 02:09.997
How long was his
heart stopped?

02:10.066 --> 02:12.201
From the looks of things, could
have been as much as five minutes.

02:12.268 --> 02:15.069
Brought him back from the dead,
not often we see those Oz.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.038
Probably had
unfinished business.

02:17.106 --> 02:18.173
What do you mean?

02:18.241 --> 02:20.408
You know, wasn't his time.

02:22.477 --> 02:24.412
Kind of reminds you why
we do the job, right?

02:24.479 --> 02:25.413
Yeah, woo.

02:25.480 --> 02:26.748
Pretty incredible.

02:26.816 --> 02:28.583
Something about
that guy though. Clive?

02:28.650 --> 02:30.151
Yeah, you did
connect with him.

02:30.219 --> 02:32.854
Could be me in 20 or 30
years if I'm not careful,

02:32.922 --> 02:35.590
you saw the guy's place. It's like
a junk food fallout shelter.

02:35.657 --> 02:36.557
Are you kidding me?

02:36.558 --> 02:38.291
You eat right, you've got
nothing to worry about.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.860
I'm one slice of pie
away at all times.

02:39.928 --> 02:42.662
You saved his life, the guy
is going to clean his act up.

02:42.731 --> 02:44.631
He's not out of the woods,
we will not know until we

02:44.699 --> 02:47.167
get an angiogram.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.535
Thanks Liv!

02:48.603 --> 02:49.937
Chalk one up to
the boys in blue!

02:50.004 --> 02:51.438
Yeah, yeah.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.172
I'm not saying we perform
miracles now, but you might

02:53.241 --> 02:55.174
see my face on a
tortilla some day.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.443
You know, like Madonna?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.077
She was on a
tortilla there?

02:58.145 --> 02:59.479
My god, that woman
is on everything.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.081
No, not.. not.. ok.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.552
I couldn't get a hold
of her pediatrician.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.320
She's got a fever,
she's not eating.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.654
Marta is sick too.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.021
I don't know, I
think it's a bug.

03:10.089 --> 03:11.390
Marta is her mother?

03:11.458 --> 03:13.158
Her nanny, I'm
a single dad.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.593
Don't worry Mr. Shelton.

03:14.661 --> 03:15.827
Keith, please.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.263
Keith, sure.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.030
You're probably right,
Marley looks like she's

03:19.098 --> 03:21.199
just got a bug, but
it's good to make sure.

03:21.268 --> 03:23.235
Here's Sandy actually,
to have to sign some forms,

03:23.303 --> 03:25.936
and we'll send the samples
to the lab and go from there.

03:26.004 --> 03:27.573
- Great. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:27.574 --> 03:29.340
I will trade you that
baby for this clipboard.

03:29.408 --> 03:30.341
Alright.

03:30.409 --> 03:31.576
Come here pumpkin!

03:31.644 --> 03:33.878
Oh! She's gorgeous.

03:33.945 --> 03:36.046
She's got her
mama's looks.

03:36.114 --> 03:38.149
Test results should be
back in a few hours.

03:38.216 --> 03:40.050
Great.

03:45.690 --> 03:46.891
It's ok, there you go.

03:46.958 --> 03:48.092
Nice and snug.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.262
[phone rings]

03:53.631 --> 03:56.267
What is it Max?

03:56.334 --> 04:00.003
No, no, listen, I told you
he is not part of this deal.

04:00.070 --> 04:02.705
Screw him! Let him sue us.
I don't care.

04:02.773 --> 04:04.174
You know, actually, that's
a good colour on you.

04:04.241 --> 04:05.641
It's my uniform.

04:05.709 --> 04:08.211
Yeah, but it looks good,
you know it looks 'tight'.

04:08.279 --> 04:09.813
Tight?

04:09.880 --> 04:11.714
Yeah, not like tight like
snug, you know I'm just

04:11.782 --> 04:12.981
making small talk here.

04:13.049 --> 04:14.149
So skip it.

04:14.217 --> 04:15.583
- Can I see you again?
- Sure.

04:15.651 --> 04:16.685
- When?
- Friday.

04:16.752 --> 04:17.685
- What time?
- Eight.

04:17.753 --> 04:18.987
- Eight.
- Where?

04:19.055 --> 04:21.690
- Rodney's.
- Tight.

04:21.757 --> 04:23.658
Fine, throw him a finder's fee,
I don't care,

04:23.726 --> 04:27.495
he doesn't deserve any more
than that, it's our deal.

04:27.563 --> 04:28.763
We made initial contact...

04:28.831 --> 04:30.497
Hey, hey!

04:30.565 --> 04:32.099
What do you think
you're doing?

04:34.136 --> 04:36.470
Help! Help me!

04:36.538 --> 04:40.308
Somebody call 911, someone
just stole my baby!

I'll go follow up
and then I'll be back, ok?

05:00.735 --> 05:02.270
So, hey, Detective,
how you doing?

05:02.337 --> 05:04.738
So what happened,
anybody see anything?

05:04.806 --> 05:07.341
- Uh...
- Paramedic Toby Logan.

05:07.409 --> 05:09.677
Logan, yeah, you worked
with Marks in the 47th?

05:09.744 --> 05:11.145
Couple times, yeah.

05:11.213 --> 05:12.880
Uh, we've got a couple of
witnesses to the

05:12.947 --> 05:15.014
drive away, but nobody
can ID the doer.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.583
We've got some surveillance
cameras out there.

05:16.651 --> 05:18.618
Yes, we've got one high
angle just before he jumps

05:18.686 --> 05:21.120
in the vehicle,
but he's wearing a hood and

05:21.189 --> 05:23.189
we never see the face.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.856
Look over here
please Keith?

05:24.924 --> 05:28.627
Mr. Shelton, hi. Um you say that
you can't describe him, is that right?

05:28.695 --> 05:30.496
Yes, sorry, it all
happened so fast.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.765
Ok, well, we've got white
male, what else, age?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.234
I don't know... 30's?

05:35.302 --> 05:38.003
Maybe, he was wearing a
hood, I couldn't see.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.937
<i>[esp]: Hey, Hey!</i>

05:42.641 --> 05:45.310
Check his hands?

05:45.377 --> 05:47.212
You fight with the
guy who did this?

05:47.279 --> 05:49.314
Yeah, I tried to grab him.

05:49.381 --> 05:51.249
I don't know, I may have
scratched his neck.

05:51.317 --> 05:54.451
If you scratched his neck
Mr. Shelton, that's great.

05:54.519 --> 05:56.220
I'm going to have somebody
come bag your hands,

05:56.287 --> 05:58.555
and we're going to look
for trace evidence, ok?

05:58.623 --> 05:59.623
I tried to stop him.

05:59.691 --> 06:01.258
I know.

06:01.326 --> 06:02.626
It's going to be ok.

06:02.694 --> 06:06.463
We're going to get
your daughter back.

You can talk about professional
distance all you like,

06:26.582 --> 06:29.351
but I just got a phone
call from Keith Shelton.

06:29.418 --> 06:32.219
Man just watched his baby
get stolen right in front of him.

06:32.287 --> 06:35.423
And just so you know,
this one's personal.

06:35.491 --> 06:37.359
I was at Marley's
christening.

06:37.426 --> 06:38.926
We've been following this
since the alert went out.

06:38.994 --> 06:40.928
Dev's been putting
together some background.

06:40.996 --> 06:43.930
Um, any personal insights
into Keith Shelton?

06:43.998 --> 06:45.733
Tough as nails business
man, but you don't

06:45.800 --> 06:48.369
get to where he has by
pulling your punches.

06:48.436 --> 06:50.337
Man's made some enemies.

06:50.405 --> 06:51.739
How soon can we
move on this?

06:51.806 --> 06:53.507
We're on our way.

06:54.643 --> 06:56.109
Something going on you
want to tell me about?

06:56.177 --> 06:57.944
Some guy with money and
power loses a kid, and we

06:58.012 --> 06:59.512
just got to hop to it?

06:59.580 --> 07:02.348
This is about a father getting
his baby back, that's it.

07:06.620 --> 07:07.988
Hey.

07:08.055 --> 07:09.522
Was wondering when the
big guns would show up.

07:09.590 --> 07:11.224
About 23:00 we should have
centralized communications

07:11.292 --> 07:12.859
set up in Shelton's house.

07:12.927 --> 07:14.560
In the mean time, we're going
to need a complete update.

07:14.628 --> 07:16.663
Well, I'm going through
the surveillance, but so

07:16.730 --> 07:19.865
far all the pieces we've got just
corroborate the father's story.

07:19.933 --> 07:21.734
Shelton did try to fight
though, scratched the guy.

07:21.802 --> 07:23.135
Lab's running it now.

07:23.203 --> 07:24.737
So you think it's a
car jacking gone bad?

07:24.805 --> 07:26.172
I don't know.

07:26.239 --> 07:27.973
SUV has got darkened
windows, maybe they guy

07:28.041 --> 07:29.575
didn't even know the
baby was in there.

07:29.643 --> 07:30.943
Well if that's the case,
then we should see the

07:31.011 --> 07:32.477
baby show up soon.

07:32.545 --> 07:34.079
One would think, I mean who
wants to graduate from

07:34.080 --> 07:35.280
stealing cars to
stealing babies.

07:35.348 --> 07:36.682
Assuming that's
what he was after.

07:36.749 --> 07:38.983
We should go get set up.

07:43.323 --> 07:46.257
Two months ago, my wife
passed away shortly after

07:46.326 --> 07:48.292
giving birth to our
daughter Marley.

07:48.360 --> 07:52.029
I never thought I would
feel that kind of pain again.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.565
But three and a half hours
ago, someone drove off

07:54.633 --> 07:56.900
with my daughter.

07:56.968 --> 07:59.069
I'm offering a one hundred
thousand dollar reward for

07:59.137 --> 08:03.707
any information leading to
the safe return of my child.

08:03.774 --> 08:07.877
Any information,
anything of value,

08:07.945 --> 08:10.413
please contact the police.

08:10.481 --> 08:12.281
And to the man
who stole my daughter,

08:12.350 --> 08:16.386
for God's sake,
please bring her back.

08:19.289 --> 08:21.289
Key's were in the car,
the engine was running,

08:21.358 --> 08:23.759
everything suggests to
a crime of opportunity.

08:23.827 --> 08:25.594
They wanted my damn car?

08:25.662 --> 08:27.028
Now they have my daughter?

08:27.096 --> 08:28.697
Well, you're a very
wealthy man, we also can't

08:28.765 --> 08:31.800
rule out a kidnapping.

08:31.868 --> 08:33.335
We're going to have to dig
into your business and

08:33.403 --> 08:36.236

disgruntled employees,

08:36.304 --> 08:37.772

Anyone who's acted with
hostility or threatened you,

of violence.

never fully explained

09:16.777 --> 09:20.446
Well, I do what I can,
that's pretty much it.

09:20.514 --> 09:22.515
Really.

09:25.384 --> 09:26.718
Ok.

09:27.753 --> 09:30.021
I've asked him for a list
of possible threats.

09:30.088 --> 09:31.523
When you brought up the
threats, Keith thought of

09:31.590 --> 09:32.990
a man confronting him.

09:33.058 --> 09:35.092
The guy was upset, said
Keith didn't know what it

09:35.160 --> 09:37.395
was like losing
something precious.

09:37.463 --> 09:39.596
So why didn't he
bring this up before?

09:39.664 --> 09:40.664
[sighs] Anything else?

09:40.732 --> 09:42.265
No that's it for now.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.934
If you don't get a baby
back within 24hrs,

09:44.001 --> 09:46.069
chances are you don't get
her back at all.

09:49.674 --> 09:50.741
Hey.

09:50.809 --> 09:52.743
Hey, he's still out.

09:52.811 --> 09:53.977
Is that normal?

09:54.045 --> 09:55.611
Primary angioplasty.

09:55.679 --> 09:59.449
The man's artery was jammed
up like the 401 on a Friday.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.917
Let me know when
he wakes up?

10:00.984 --> 10:03.052
You don't want to get
attached to your patient.

10:03.119 --> 10:06.355
You know the handbook.
Go work on your next miracle.

10:06.423 --> 10:08.057
Just checking in, you know?

10:08.124 --> 10:09.492
No big deal.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.860
I just hope you're not looking
for more than personal satisfaction.

10:11.928 --> 10:13.428
I'm not!

10:13.496 --> 10:15.497
I know what we do, we're
little life saving worker bees.

10:15.565 --> 10:17.499
It would just be nice to
get a little honey from

10:17.567 --> 10:20.669
the queen every
once in a while.

10:20.736 --> 10:21.903
You're cute Oz.

10:21.971 --> 10:23.605
I prefer suave
and debonair,

10:23.673 --> 10:26.475
but cute works too.

10:31.046 --> 10:32.513
That's perfect thank you.

10:34.816 --> 10:36.451
Ok so, just spoke to the
nanny, no signs anyone's

10:36.518 --> 10:39.920
been following her when
she's been out with the baby.

10:39.989 --> 10:42.090
You were on a call with a
man named Max Retton when

10:42.157 --> 10:44.024
the kidnapping took place.

10:44.092 --> 10:45.459
Right, my assistant.

10:45.526 --> 10:46.759
He said you were pretty
hot under the collar about

10:46.827 --> 10:48.828
some business associate.

10:48.896 --> 10:51.931
So? I don't see what
this has to do with Marley.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.134
Well we have to check on every
lead, no matter how remote.

10:54.202 --> 10:56.169
So you don't think this was
a simple car jacking then.

10:56.237 --> 10:57.770
I think if that was the
case, Marley would have

10:57.838 --> 10:59.272
shown up by now.

10:59.340 --> 11:00.806
As the hours go by, the
intentional kidnapping

11:00.874 --> 11:02.741
scenario becomes
more likely.

11:02.809 --> 11:05.011
There has been
no ransom demand.

11:05.078 --> 11:06.879
That doesn't mean
we won't get one.

11:08.281 --> 11:09.948
I've been adding to that
list of people that

11:10.017 --> 11:14.120
I've managed to anger
or alienate.

11:14.187 --> 11:17.222
I suppose it could
be a lot longer.

11:17.289 --> 11:19.891
Forced into bankruptcy,
blames you.

11:19.958 --> 11:22.127
Accused of accounting
irregularities, couple of

11:22.194 --> 11:25.296
fired employees, sexual
harassment suit.

11:25.364 --> 11:26.731
Wait, what's this?

11:26.798 --> 11:28.799
Benjamin Lawrence holds
you accountable for

11:28.867 --> 11:30.868
the death of his
wife and child?

11:30.936 --> 11:33.970
Yeah, it's a tragic thing,
but it was an accident.

11:34.039 --> 11:36.440
Carbon monoxide poisoning;
faulty furnace made by one

11:36.508 --> 11:38.075
of our subsidiaries.

11:38.143 --> 11:40.810
Accident or not, it sounds
like he holds you responsible.

11:40.878 --> 11:43.747
Well there was a settlement,
I apologized personally,

11:43.814 --> 11:46.350
we overhauled our safety
policy and put it behind us.

11:46.418 --> 11:48.151
You had a restraining
order on Mr. Lawrence?

11:48.218 --> 11:52.788
Yeah, he assaulted me in a
hotel lobby, I took 12 stitches.

11:52.856 --> 11:55.291
Why didn't you bring
this up before?

11:55.359 --> 11:57.393
I figured it was
all over with.

11:57.461 --> 12:01.330
I've made amends, besides,
he got 11 months for battery.

12:01.398 --> 12:03.199
I think he's
still in jail.

12:03.267 --> 12:04.566
Not anymore he's not.

12:04.633 --> 12:06.501
Benjamin Lawrence was
released 8 days ago.

12:06.569 --> 12:16.311
[♪]

12:23.118 --> 12:25.386
So Mr. Lawrence, you're telling
me that you know nothing

12:25.454 --> 12:29.256
about the disappearance
of Keith Shelton's baby?

12:29.324 --> 12:31.058
Only what I've
seen in the news.

12:31.126 --> 12:34.095
And what was your reaction
when you found out?

12:34.162 --> 12:36.729
What do you want me to say,
that I was glad he was in pain?

12:36.797 --> 12:38.364
Why not? You're only human.

12:38.432 --> 12:40.300
I don't want to see
anybody's baby hurt.

12:40.367 --> 12:44.104
But Shelton never gave a damn
about my kid, and my wife.

12:44.171 --> 12:47.006
I understand that you
suffered a great loss.

12:47.074 --> 12:49.275
But why would you blame
the head of the company?

12:49.343 --> 12:51.010
Who do I look to, huh?

12:51.078 --> 12:54.179
I find my family dead because
nobody tested a furnace.

12:54.247 --> 12:55.847
So who's fault is that?

12:55.915 --> 12:57.549
Some guy on the
assembly line?

12:57.617 --> 12:59.884
Obviously, you
blame Mr. Shelton.

12:59.952 --> 13:01.653
The guy's a gazzillionaire.

13:01.721 --> 13:06.658
He uses a 20 cent part when a two
buck part could have prevented this.

13:06.726 --> 13:09.160
Who makes a
decision like that?

13:09.261 --> 13:11.362
Somebody has to
take responsibility.

13:11.430 --> 13:13.797
Well he claims that he
apologized to you personally.

13:13.865 --> 13:17.735
Yeah, he left a message
on my voicemail.

13:18.470 --> 13:23.073
So where were you when the
kidnapping took place?

13:23.142 --> 13:25.509
So I'm on the hook for
what happened here?

13:25.576 --> 13:29.179
I'm simply asking
a question.

13:29.247 --> 13:33.883
Last night, I was moving stuff
out of a friend's basement.

13:33.951 --> 13:36.386
And your friend,
he can back this up?

13:36.454 --> 13:39.623
No, he wasn't there,
he left me the key.

13:39.690 --> 13:42.525
That's not much
of an alibi is it?

13:42.592 --> 13:47.296
I didn't take
anybody's child.

13:49.599 --> 13:53.001
This is surveillance footage
from the hospital entrance.

13:53.069 --> 13:54.603
You see that figure there?

13:54.671 --> 13:57.738
It looks like he's following
Keith and the baby, right?

13:57.806 --> 14:00.741
I'm just going to
enhance the image.

14:00.809 --> 14:05.313
Alright, alright,
I was, I was there.

14:05.381 --> 14:08.849
I was afraid to say
anything because I was

14:08.917 --> 14:10.552
sure someone would
point a finger.

14:10.619 --> 14:12.952
Well consider
yourself pointed at.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.223
I'd been following him
for a couple of days.

14:16.291 --> 14:18.692
No more restraining order.

14:18.759 --> 14:21.195
I wanted to confront him,
you know, tell him this is

14:21.262 --> 14:23.063
long from over.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.031
And what stopped you?

14:25.099 --> 14:29.068
I saw that he had his baby
with him, so I decided

14:29.135 --> 14:31.204
to bide my time.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.939
Right, so what,
you went home?

14:34.007 --> 14:38.377
Look, I know what it's
like to lose a child.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.779
Do you really think that
I would do something

14:40.847 --> 14:43.516
like that to another
human being?

14:43.584 --> 14:47.552
Even an SOB like Shelton?

14:48.754 --> 14:49.921
[baby crying]

14:49.988 --> 14:51.389
Can't you stop
her from crying?

14:51.457 --> 14:54.158
You want someone to report
us before we collect?

14:54.227 --> 14:56.528
I cut up a sleeping pill
and put it in her formula.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.530
Doesn't she have a pacifier
in the bag or something?

14:58.598 --> 15:00.064
Well, look for it!

15:00.132 --> 15:03.334
[baby crying]

15:03.401 --> 15:06.036
Damn!

15:06.104 --> 15:08.639
We've waited long enough, we
should be asking for that money.

15:08.707 --> 15:09.973
Soon.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.175
No, look the longer we
hold on to this baby,

15:12.244 --> 15:15.779
the more risk of this whole
thing blowing up in our face.

15:15.847 --> 15:19.081
Are you questioning
me, Donald?

15:19.149 --> 15:20.483
No.

15:20.551 --> 15:24.353
No, no, I'm just... this job
was supposed to be simple.

15:24.420 --> 15:27.123
We've a good plan,
we should stick to it.

15:27.190 --> 15:29.691
You let <i>me</i> worry
about that ok?

15:31.194 --> 15:34.730
Damnit! Shut the hell up!

15:34.798 --> 15:36.866
It's ok, I've got her.

15:36.933 --> 15:41.803
[baby crying]

15:45.859 --> 15:50.528
[♪]

15:50.596 --> 15:52.062
Alright, what have we got?

15:52.130 --> 15:53.564
Well, after reviewing the
footage on Lawrence

15:53.632 --> 15:55.867
and of the actual kidnapping,
we've ruled Lawrence out

15:55.934 --> 15:57.301
as the actual kidnapper.

15:57.369 --> 15:59.637
We did a simple biometric
analysis of their gaits,

15:59.705 --> 16:02.072
no two people move
the exact same way.

16:02.140 --> 16:03.307
Course that doesn't mean
he wasn't working with

16:03.375 --> 16:06.075
someone; he stays
on the suspect list.

16:09.480 --> 16:13.449
[♪]

16:13.518 --> 16:14.985
[sighs]

16:15.052 --> 16:21.257
[♪]

16:21.325 --> 16:22.224
Thanks Mike.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.291
Thanks.

16:23.359 --> 16:24.793
Toby, I need you now.

16:24.861 --> 16:27.563
Liv no, no more sex at work.
I can't do that anymore.

16:27.631 --> 16:29.064
That's not even funny.

16:29.132 --> 16:30.799
There is a woman in the
waiting room, I am telling you,

16:30.800 --> 16:32.100
she knows something
about the kidnapping.

16:32.168 --> 16:35.037
Tell her to go
to the police.

16:35.104 --> 16:36.509
Please?

16:36.510 --> 16:37.639
Fine!

16:43.278 --> 16:46.681
<i>[esp]: I can't do this,</i>
<i>they'll never listen.</i>

16:52.387 --> 16:53.787
Hey, how are you doing?

16:53.855 --> 16:56.557
I noticed your sketches.

16:56.624 --> 16:59.660
I was wondering if
I could just take a peek.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.195
<i>[esp]: The police need to</i>
<i>see this, not you.</i>

17:02.263 --> 17:04.665
You know what, I don't
think that's a good idea.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.599
I work with the police.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.602
My name is Toby.

17:08.670 --> 17:09.635
Rose.

17:09.703 --> 17:12.237
Hi Rose.

17:12.305 --> 17:14.707
I left word on the tip line,
but nobody called me back,

17:14.775 --> 17:17.242
so I thought I would
come to the hospital,

17:17.310 --> 17:20.079
and just be here where it
happened, I thought that

17:20.146 --> 17:21.446
was a good idea.

17:21.513 --> 17:25.050
<i>[esp]: I hoped she'd</i>
<i>give me more.</i>

17:28.588 --> 17:30.188
<i>Make the</i>
<i>cheekbones higher.</i>

17:31.924 --> 17:36.728
Rose, do you mind if
I look at the sketches?

17:45.269 --> 17:49.439
<i>[muffled voices]</i>
<i>Fine, throw him a finder's fee,</i>
<i>I don't care.</i>

17:49.507 --> 17:51.174
Did you see the
kidnapping?

17:51.242 --> 17:55.178
If you're asking
if I was there, no.

17:55.246 --> 17:56.546
<i>[muffled voices, shouting]</i>

17:56.615 --> 17:58.181
Then how did you do these?

17:58.249 --> 18:04.221
It's what I do.
And no, I can't explain it.

18:04.288 --> 18:06.223
Do you mind waiting here?

18:06.290 --> 18:09.526
I know someone you
should talk to.

18:09.594 --> 18:11.661
Ok.

18:20.570 --> 18:26.008
Miss Drake, well I'm
no art expert,

18:26.075 --> 18:28.410
but I'm wondering how you
were able to create

18:28.478 --> 18:31.513
a likeness to a crime scene
that you were never at.

18:31.580 --> 18:35.116
Every single detail
is the exact same.

18:35.184 --> 18:36.251
I have a gift.

18:36.318 --> 18:37.619
It would seem that way.

18:37.686 --> 18:42.890
I mean I see images in my
head, I don't know where

18:42.958 --> 18:47.327
they come from exactly,
and then I feel compelled

18:47.395 --> 18:48.928
to draw them.

18:48.996 --> 18:51.365
I'm just wondering why you
decided to come to us with this?

18:51.432 --> 18:52.599
Because I thought these
pictures might help you

18:52.667 --> 18:56.002
find that baby.

18:56.070 --> 18:57.237
Did anyone give
you a description

18:57.305 --> 18:58.505
that you worked from?

18:58.573 --> 19:00.674
No!

19:01.643 --> 19:03.108
That's all I could see.

19:03.177 --> 19:04.310
Well it's not like we'd be
able to pick someone out

19:04.378 --> 19:06.412
of a line up
based on these.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.248
Look, maybe there will
be more, I don't know.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.317
This doesn't
happen very often.

19:11.385 --> 19:13.186
Have you worked for
the police before?

19:13.253 --> 19:14.287
Two years ago.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.821
What happened?

19:15.889 --> 19:20.559
Uh, once I understood what
the drawings meant

19:20.626 --> 19:23.895
and then the case was solved
and it really wouldn't

19:23.962 --> 19:25.730
have made any
difference at all.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.832
Right, but you think it's
going to make a difference now,

19:27.833 --> 19:30.569
like maybe you think you'll get
some kind of recognition?

19:30.636 --> 19:32.970
You know this is
so not about me.

19:34.206 --> 19:36.574
Well thank you for your
time, every clue helps.

19:36.641 --> 19:37.974
Can I have my sketchbook?

19:38.042 --> 19:39.876
Yeah, after we've
scanned the images.

19:39.944 --> 19:41.912
I'm going to need a
way to contact you.

19:41.979 --> 19:43.850
Fine.

19:46.418 --> 19:47.752
Yeah, ok, I know what
you're thinking.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.420
Why am I questioning
this woman's story

19:49.487 --> 19:51.053
while I'm sitting here
talking to a telepath?

19:51.121 --> 19:52.054
Yeah.

19:52.122 --> 19:53.823
I just find it
a little weird.

19:53.890 --> 19:57.993
Ok, well lets, what if she's not
the psychic she claims to be?

19:58.061 --> 19:59.429
So now you're the skeptic?

19:59.496 --> 20:00.996
What if she is working
with someone who saw

20:01.064 --> 20:03.899
the crime but is afraid to come
forward for whatever reason?

20:03.967 --> 20:05.768
Ok, what do you know?

20:05.836 --> 20:08.670
When I read her, there was
a woman prompting her,

20:08.738 --> 20:13.141
telling her how to
adjust the drawings.

20:13.209 --> 20:14.175
Ok.

20:14.244 --> 20:21.783
[♪]

20:21.851 --> 20:23.551
Gentlemen.

20:23.619 --> 20:26.086
Good to see you using that
bench for something Mr. Bey.

20:26.154 --> 20:27.755
Yeah well.

20:27.822 --> 20:31.325
So you know that guy's life
that you saved, Clive Walters?

20:31.393 --> 20:32.426
Yeah what about him?

20:32.494 --> 20:33.861
He's awake in recovery.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.363
Olivia's convinced he
survived because he's on

20:35.430 --> 20:37.164
some unfulfilled mission.

20:37.232 --> 20:39.065
Yeah, I think I
know what it is.

20:39.133 --> 20:41.033
He filed a complaint
against you.

20:41.101 --> 20:42.636
I'm sorry what?

20:42.703 --> 20:44.937
He's alleging professional
incompetence.

20:45.005 --> 20:46.573
Sir, I saved his life!

20:46.641 --> 20:48.508
No good deed
goes unpunished.

20:48.576 --> 20:50.477
I guess he survived to
see you crash and burn.

20:50.544 --> 21:03.455
[♪]

21:03.523 --> 21:04.890
Thanks.

21:04.957 --> 21:06.659
I'm not exactly high
functioning right now.

21:06.726 --> 21:08.727
Who would be under
these circumstances?

21:08.795 --> 21:11.229
Al, I think about the son
of a bitch who took my kid

21:11.230 --> 21:13.198
and swear to God
I want to kill him.

21:13.266 --> 21:18.970
I can't even begin to imagine
the hell you're going through.

21:19.038 --> 21:22.007
Tara sacrificed herself.

21:22.074 --> 21:27.044
She literally gave her life to
bring that baby into the world.

21:27.112 --> 21:31.715
At first I didn't understand
why she was refusing Chemo.

21:31.783 --> 21:35.852
She wanted to wait
until the baby was born.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.553
I don't have to tell you
how much that baby meant

21:37.621 --> 21:43.459
to her, to both of us.

21:43.527 --> 21:48.597
I lost my wife Al,
I can't lose Marley too.

21:56.405 --> 21:58.707
She's finally settled.

21:58.774 --> 22:04.179
One million, it's
nothing to Shelton.

22:04.247 --> 22:07.815
Just think, how far a
million dollars will

22:07.883 --> 22:12.486
go in Costa Rica?

22:12.554 --> 22:18.792
Listening to the waves,
sipping margaritas,

22:18.861 --> 22:22.028
sex on the beach.

22:22.096 --> 22:24.998
Yeah, I mean, you know, we
get that money, drop the

22:25.066 --> 22:30.603
kid off somewhere,
we go celebrate.

22:30.671 --> 22:34.341
Why do we need to
drop off the kid?

22:34.408 --> 22:35.708
What do you want to do?

22:35.776 --> 22:37.676
Do you want to take
her to Costa Rica?

22:42.249 --> 22:44.316
I was just imagining the
look on Shelton's face

22:44.384 --> 22:50.722
if she turned up dead...

22:50.790 --> 22:57.862
Um, look, I didn't sign on
for any kid getting killed.

22:57.930 --> 23:00.698
[♪]

23:00.766 --> 23:04.035
I can't believe you
thought I was serious.

23:20.904 --> 23:24.341
Hi, how are you doing?

23:24.408 --> 23:26.576
You know you just had
angioplasty, right?

23:26.644 --> 23:27.910
What's it to you?

23:27.978 --> 23:29.312
Well, I'm the guy
who saved your life?

23:29.380 --> 23:31.047
Oh, you're the paramedic.

23:31.115 --> 23:32.515
Yeah, I'm the paramedic
who restarted your

23:32.582 --> 23:35.217
cholesterol soaked heart.

23:35.285 --> 23:37.219
I lodged a complaint
against you.

23:37.287 --> 23:38.621
You know, under the
circumstances, I think a

23:38.688 --> 23:41.190
couple cracked ribs;
not a bad deal for you.

23:41.258 --> 23:42.358
You could have killed me.

23:42.425 --> 23:44.193
No, you were already dead.

23:44.261 --> 23:45.894
We brought you
back to life.

23:45.962 --> 23:47.863
What do you want me to do, you
want me to say you're a hero?

23:47.930 --> 23:50.731
You get paid to
help people, right?

23:50.799 --> 23:52.333
Yeah.

23:52.401 --> 23:55.770
I don't like owing anybody
anything, you saved my life,

23:55.837 --> 23:59.140
now you're making me feel
like I owe you something.

23:59.208 --> 24:00.741
You don't owe
me anything sir.

24:00.809 --> 24:02.377
Good, good.

24:02.444 --> 24:04.045
Then get the hell out of
my room so I can enjoy

24:04.112 --> 24:07.013
my lunch in peace.

24:07.081 --> 24:08.081
Ok, I'm taking this pizza.

24:08.149 --> 24:09.283
What are you doing?

24:09.350 --> 24:10.250
I'm taking the pizza.

24:10.318 --> 24:11.485
No!

24:11.553 --> 24:13.153
[struggle]

24:13.221 --> 24:15.389
Hey, hey!

24:15.456 --> 24:17.357
Alright post op
pizza party is over.

24:19.527 --> 24:20.560
Hey...!

24:20.627 --> 24:21.661
What are
you thinking Oz?

24:24.030 --> 24:25.398
Gimme this.

24:25.465 --> 24:27.032
Like I brought him the
pizza, what are you nuts?

24:27.100 --> 24:29.402
[knock on door]

24:31.905 --> 24:33.806
Hey there, how you doing?

24:33.873 --> 24:35.808
Hi. I'm ok.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.041
Sketchbook.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.510
Thanks.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.011
You want to come in?

24:40.079 --> 24:42.780
Yeah, love to, thank you.

24:44.417 --> 24:45.917
I just made coffee.

24:45.984 --> 24:48.019
Yeah, I'd
love some, that's great.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.387
Great.

24:49.455 --> 24:50.622
It's a really nice place.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.456
Thank you.

24:52.524 --> 24:54.891
You've got
awesome drawings.

24:54.959 --> 24:57.994
Would you like
to see my latest?

25:01.833 --> 25:03.867
This is new information.

25:03.935 --> 25:05.502
You've got to bring
this to the police.

25:05.570 --> 25:08.238
Well you saw what happened
last time, missing baby or not,

25:08.305 --> 25:11.274
I don't think anyone
really believes that

25:11.342 --> 25:13.276
my drawings are
going to help.

25:13.344 --> 25:15.712
So you're saying that he
stopped the car and that

25:15.779 --> 25:16.812
a woman got in?

25:16.880 --> 25:19.815
No, I'm not
saying anything.

25:19.883 --> 25:21.718
It's whatever
the picture says.

25:21.785 --> 25:23.686
People don't take you
seriously because they

25:23.754 --> 25:26.455
don't know where the
drawings are from.

25:26.522 --> 25:29.658
I already told you, I
don't know exactly.

25:29.726 --> 25:32.961
This woman who got you
involved in this, she's

25:33.028 --> 25:35.697
pressuring you, isn't she?

25:35.765 --> 25:36.998
And you don't want
to disappoint her,

25:37.066 --> 25:38.099
is that what's going on?

25:38.167 --> 25:40.468
<i>[esp]: You don't have a clue.</i>

25:40.535 --> 25:43.671
Try me.

25:46.174 --> 25:48.476
Oh God.

25:49.544 --> 25:51.178
Ok.

25:51.246 --> 25:55.383
A couple of years ago, this
Ontario family was vacationing

25:55.450 --> 25:58.985
in Mexico, and their teenage
daughter went missing.

25:59.052 --> 26:01.521
The investigation was
coming up dead ends,

26:01.589 --> 26:06.125
but I knew she'd been murdered,
and I knew where the body was.

26:06.193 --> 26:07.661
And what did you do?

26:07.728 --> 26:11.531
Anonymous call to the
Provincial Police, but the

26:11.599 --> 26:14.633
drawings helped me to the
location and then they

26:14.701 --> 26:18.304
found her body in a cove.

26:18.371 --> 26:22.474
Alright, so you gave the family
closure, that's important.

26:22.542 --> 26:27.646
No, I think I actually
added to their suffering.

26:27.714 --> 26:32.317
After that I said I wasn't
going to get involved again.

26:32.384 --> 26:37.988
Um, that girl in Mexico,
she led me to her

26:38.056 --> 26:40.191
mutilated body.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.695
That's what you do, you
communicate with spirits,

26:44.762 --> 26:45.895
with people on
the other side?

26:45.963 --> 26:49.132
Is that what
you're telling me?

26:49.200 --> 26:58.241
[♪]

26:58.309 --> 27:02.545
Um, if I let them in, I
can see them, and I can

27:02.612 --> 27:07.082
hear them, and I can
see their pictures.

27:07.150 --> 27:09.785
That comes with a price.

27:11.355 --> 27:14.623
[phone rings]

27:14.691 --> 27:19.260
Ok answer on
three, one, two...

27:19.328 --> 27:20.662
This is Keith Shelton.

27:20.730 --> 27:22.897
Yeah, I think you know
exactly what I want.

27:22.965 --> 27:25.633
How do I know
this is real?

27:25.701 --> 27:28.970
There's a hole in one knee
of her leggings and

27:29.037 --> 27:32.206
<i>dry cleaning stamp J22</i>
<i>on her snowjacket.</i>

27:32.274 --> 27:33.173
You have my baby.

27:33.241 --> 27:34.408
Is she ok?

27:34.476 --> 27:35.542
Is Marley ok?

27:35.610 --> 27:36.643
Keep rolling, I
need 10 seconds.

27:36.711 --> 27:39.079
One million dollars,
large bills.

27:39.146 --> 27:41.313
Fine, alright, but I need to
know that Marley is okay.

27:41.382 --> 27:42.915
Put the phone next
to her please.

27:42.983 --> 27:44.517
Don't you see what
they're doing?

27:44.585 --> 27:46.386
Get off now!

27:46.453 --> 27:48.187
We see any cops,
this baby dies.

27:48.255 --> 27:49.455
Keep going, keep going.

27:49.523 --> 27:50.723
Just tell me where
I need to be.

27:50.791 --> 27:52.892
I said no more
than 15 seconds!

27:52.959 --> 27:54.126
<i>[arguing]</i>

27:54.194 --> 27:55.227
<i>Give me the damn phone.</i>

27:55.295 --> 27:56.227
Hello? Hello?

27:56.295 --> 27:58.963
[dial tone]

27:59.031 --> 28:00.298
I didn't get it.

28:07.008 --> 28:09.811
So I could only place the
call within a 12 block

28:09.878 --> 28:11.546
radius in downtown
Toronto, but there's like

28:11.613 --> 28:13.881
12,000 residences.

28:13.949 --> 28:15.516
Ok, well we know we're
looking for a couple.

28:15.584 --> 28:17.218
Has our profiler given us
any information as to who

28:17.285 --> 28:18.686
it is we're looking for?

28:18.754 --> 28:21.988
Symbiotic narcissism,
sense of entitlement,

28:22.056 --> 28:24.257
one partner possibly
dominates, and the choice

28:24.325 --> 28:32.799
of target is unlikely
to be random.

28:32.867 --> 28:34.267
Wow, this is so messed up.

28:34.335 --> 28:36.302
We should just
call him back.

28:36.370 --> 28:38.671
We were this close to
closing that deal.

28:38.739 --> 28:41.407
We were this close
to being traced.

28:41.475 --> 28:43.108
So we use another phone,
we make the call from

28:43.176 --> 28:44.910
somewhere else.

28:44.978 --> 28:46.579
What's your hurry Donny?

28:46.646 --> 28:48.113
Are you kidding me?

28:48.181 --> 28:49.615
You want those cops to
have more time to figure

28:49.683 --> 28:51.717
out what's what?

28:51.785 --> 28:53.818
We can afford to wait.

28:53.887 --> 28:58.857
Reagan...

28:58.925 --> 29:03.328
I want to tear his heart
out, and then show it to him.

29:03.396 --> 29:08.033
Baby, that's
crazy talk.

29:08.101 --> 29:09.934
He has to suffer.

29:10.035 --> 29:14.405
You saw him on TV.
Okay? He's suffering.

29:14.472 --> 29:17.341
Not enough.

29:17.409 --> 29:18.609
That's it.

29:18.676 --> 29:20.177
I'm going to call him.

29:41.531 --> 29:43.465
We already know that the
kidnapper had an accomplice.

29:43.533 --> 29:44.833
Well he stopped
to pick her up.

29:44.901 --> 29:46.701
Why didn't you share
this information before?

29:46.769 --> 29:47.836
I didn't know it before.

29:47.904 --> 29:48.971
And why is that?

29:49.039 --> 29:50.605
Well, because we
just reconnected.

29:50.673 --> 29:52.141
It's not like I
can summon her.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.276
And who is this, that
you're talking about?

29:54.344 --> 29:56.145
The woman. And who is she?

29:56.212 --> 29:59.013
Uh, I don't know.

29:59.081 --> 30:01.316
Well thank you for that.

30:08.457 --> 30:11.892
Rose?

30:11.961 --> 30:14.061
Ahh..

30:14.128 --> 30:16.663
Is that the woman you've
been communicating with?

30:16.730 --> 30:18.031
Keith's wife?

30:18.099 --> 30:19.899
It's no wonder she broke
through even though

30:19.968 --> 30:22.135
I tried to resist.

30:22.203 --> 30:25.138
A woman trying
to save her baby.

30:25.206 --> 30:28.741
What's going on here?

30:28.809 --> 30:30.343
Who's this woman?

30:30.410 --> 30:33.579
She's helping us with
the investigation.

30:33.646 --> 30:36.482
Did you say you were
communicating with my dead wife?

30:36.549 --> 30:37.950
What is this?

30:38.018 --> 30:40.919
I thought I was dealing
with professionals here.

30:40.988 --> 30:43.055
Everyone here wants
the same thing, ok?

30:43.123 --> 30:45.623
Why don't you
just come with me.

30:56.902 --> 30:59.704
Mr. Walters, you were
looking for me?

30:59.771 --> 31:01.405
Yeah.

31:01.473 --> 31:07.844
Can you hand me down some salt,
so maybe I can eat this food?

31:07.912 --> 31:09.113
Salt?

31:09.180 --> 31:10.947
Yeah, I'll let the
volunteers know.

31:11.016 --> 31:13.350
Hey, that Nurse Sandy said
you were sniffing around

31:13.418 --> 31:15.552
about the night
you brought me in?

31:15.620 --> 31:17.786
Well, the first few hours
are crucial, and you

31:17.854 --> 31:20.456
didn't have any family,
you know.

31:20.524 --> 31:23.859
About the complaint.

31:23.927 --> 31:26.662
I don't really have anything
to say about that.

31:26.730 --> 31:28.964
You're not going to deny
that you weren't after me

31:29.033 --> 31:30.366
about that?

31:30.434 --> 31:31.434
What, are you going to
complain to my supervisor

31:31.502 --> 31:33.801
that I'm
harassing you now?

31:33.869 --> 31:35.904
No, I'm going to tell
your supervisor that I'm

31:35.971 --> 31:38.740
dropping the complaint.

31:38.807 --> 31:43.745
Really?

31:43.812 --> 31:46.714
Why?

31:46.782 --> 31:49.417
'Cause you saved
my life, you idiot.

31:49.484 --> 31:53.487
And this way, I don't
have to say thank you.

31:53.555 --> 31:55.622
Now give me some salt.

31:55.690 --> 31:58.926
Yes, some salt.

32:04.399 --> 32:07.333
Hey Rose, how are you?

32:07.401 --> 32:09.335
Why can't they
all go away?

32:09.403 --> 32:11.003
You're never really alone.

32:11.072 --> 32:13.639
Constantly hounded.

32:13.707 --> 32:15.775
You're getting too caught
up in the distractions.

32:15.842 --> 32:17.009
That's why it's taking so
long to do those images.

32:17.078 --> 32:18.411
You've got to let it go.

32:18.479 --> 32:20.146
I know, but you don't
know what it's like Toby.

32:20.214 --> 32:21.680
You feel bombarded,
you feel burdened by

32:21.747 --> 32:23.648
information you don't want,
you wish it would stop.

32:23.716 --> 32:25.517
It never will.

32:25.585 --> 32:27.553
That's why I have to
protect myself,

32:27.620 --> 32:29.121
or I would go crazy.

32:29.189 --> 32:33.492
Rose, you're connection
with that spirit of that

32:33.560 --> 32:36.761
mother is our best chance
of finding Marley.

32:36.829 --> 32:38.229
If you can't block out
that distraction, if you

32:38.297 --> 32:44.435
can't slow it down,
we may never find her.

32:45.637 --> 32:49.207
You've got to try, I
know you can do it.

32:55.580 --> 32:58.948
<i>Thank God, we don't</i>
<i>have much time.</i>

32:59.016 --> 33:09.958
[♪]

33:10.026 --> 33:12.628
This is the place the
mother showed me.

33:12.695 --> 33:16.031
She said find it, and
you'll find Marley.

33:16.099 --> 33:18.334
This is your
idea of evidence.

33:18.401 --> 33:19.968
We've got a positive ID
on the DNA found under

33:20.036 --> 33:22.704
Mr. Shelton's fingernails
to Donald Kincaid.

33:22.772 --> 33:25.073
His last known residence
was a low rise on

33:25.141 --> 33:26.741
Harbourfront, I don't
know if it's current.

33:26.808 --> 33:28.610
Ok send a unit, I'll
follow shortly.

33:28.677 --> 33:30.811
No, it's a walk up
apartment, above a bakery,

33:30.879 --> 33:32.313
it is not a low rise.

33:32.381 --> 33:35.983
I'm sorry, we're going to
go with the DNA on this one.

33:36.051 --> 33:39.053
I'm sure you mean well,
really, but I'm going to

33:39.121 --> 33:43.157
have to ask you to leave.

33:43.224 --> 33:44.424
She said if the baby was a
boy you would have named

33:44.492 --> 33:49.329
him Simon.

33:49.397 --> 33:50.664
That picture, that place.

33:50.731 --> 33:57.436
That's where your baby is.

33:59.973 --> 34:04.810
Dev, how long would it
take you to find this place?

34:04.878 --> 34:07.446
Give me a few minutes.

34:07.514 --> 34:08.581
Ok.

34:17.121 --> 34:19.190
IIB!

34:19.257 --> 34:21.059
[♪]

34:21.126 --> 34:22.726
Check the closet.

34:22.795 --> 34:24.195
Clear.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.263
Check the kitchen.

34:26.331 --> 34:27.264
Clear, bedroom's clear.

34:27.331 --> 34:28.833
He's here.

34:32.103 --> 34:35.438
Sir?

34:35.507 --> 34:38.341
Where's the baby?
Where's Marley?

34:38.409 --> 34:40.376
I don't know.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.168
[♪]

34:48.237 --> 34:50.839
Here, put these
on your head.

34:50.907 --> 34:53.708
Where did your
girlfriend take the baby?

34:53.775 --> 34:56.944
I don't know, uh, she
took my keys though.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.178
What kind of car?

34:58.246 --> 35:01.148
An old red BMW.

35:01.215 --> 35:03.050
[♪]

35:03.117 --> 35:05.953
<i>[esp]: Did you really think</i>
<i>it was about the money?</i>

35:06.021 --> 35:08.689
<i>He's going to suffer</i>
<i>like my mom suffered.</i>

35:12.677 --> 35:14.277
Her name's Reagan, it's
not about the money.

35:14.345 --> 35:15.845
She wants revenge.

35:15.913 --> 35:21.017
[♪]

35:21.084 --> 35:22.018
[baby crying]

35:22.085 --> 35:24.020
[phone ringing]

35:24.087 --> 35:25.221
Keith Shelton.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.657
<i>I want that one</i>
<i>million dollars.</i>

35:27.725 --> 35:29.891
Meet me at the Quadrangle
Industrial Park,

35:29.959 --> 35:32.561
485 Tremain, 1 hour.

35:32.629 --> 35:33.929
<i>Ok.</i>

35:33.996 --> 35:35.631
You got it, a million
dollars, but please,

35:35.699 --> 35:37.132
don't harm my daughter.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.467
No cops!

35:38.535 --> 35:40.969
If I see cops, you don't
get her back alive.

35:44.040 --> 35:49.610
[baby crying]

35:49.678 --> 35:51.145
How many crank calls have
we had on the tip line today?

35:51.213 --> 35:52.313
Truth.

35:52.381 --> 35:54.349
You can't handle
the  truth.

35:55.551 --> 35:57.017
Ok, sorry.

35:57.085 --> 35:59.286
Just speak normally,
that will do the rest.

35:59.355 --> 36:00.687
Okay.

36:00.755 --> 36:03.757
Keith, we need to talk
about this woman Reagan.

36:03.825 --> 36:07.561
We think she's upset about
something you did to her mother.

36:07.628 --> 36:08.829
Did you say Reagan?

36:08.896 --> 36:11.631
Yeah.

36:11.699 --> 36:14.768
What is it?

36:14.836 --> 36:18.904
Long time ago, I may have
gotten this girl pregnant.

36:18.972 --> 36:21.507
But I was just a kid, and
I walked away from her,

36:21.575 --> 36:23.642
the baby, the
whole situation.

36:23.710 --> 36:26.645
Some time later, I found
out that she killed herself.

36:26.713 --> 36:27.980
What about the baby?

36:28.047 --> 36:29.515
I have no idea.

36:29.583 --> 36:30.983
Well, that's not true.

36:31.050 --> 36:32.251
A few years ago, I started
getting some emails from

36:32.318 --> 36:34.886
a young girl claiming
to be my daughter.

36:34.953 --> 36:38.356
How did you respond?

36:38.424 --> 36:40.558
I hit delete.

36:40.626 --> 36:43.261
Michelle, we can't
send him in alone.

36:43.328 --> 36:45.730
She said no cops, she said
she would kill Marley.

36:45.798 --> 36:47.098
We'll be close by.

36:47.165 --> 36:48.565
Let me go with him.

36:48.633 --> 36:49.733
I could wear my uniform,
say I'm a paramedic there

36:49.801 --> 36:51.802
to check out the baby.

36:51.870 --> 36:53.737
Ok.

36:53.805 --> 37:01.111
[♪]

37:01.178 --> 37:02.746
She's got the baby.

37:02.814 --> 37:03.947
Ok, just be careful.

37:04.048 --> 37:05.214
Whatever you do,
don't set her off

37:05.282 --> 37:07.149
Who is that?
I said no cops!

37:07.217 --> 37:08.918
I'm not a cop,
I'm a paramedic.

37:08.985 --> 37:10.753
I'm just here to make
sure the baby's ok.

37:10.821 --> 37:14.824
I know who you are Reagan.

37:14.892 --> 37:17.092
Look, whatever issue you
have with me, this baby

37:17.160 --> 37:18.561
has nothing to do with you.

37:18.629 --> 37:20.195
Don't come any closer.

37:20.297 --> 37:21.830
Reagan put the knife down.

37:21.898 --> 37:22.898
Ok, we should go.

37:22.965 --> 37:24.132
No. Just wait, wait.

37:24.199 --> 37:25.967
<i>Please don't</i>
<i>don't do this Reagan.</i>

37:26.035 --> 37:27.936
<i>Let me see the money.</i>

37:31.173 --> 37:34.976
Come on, toss it here!

37:35.812 --> 37:37.077
I know I've made my
mistakes.

37:37.145 --> 37:40.481
Yeah... and I was one of them.

37:40.549 --> 37:42.416
Reagan please,
listen to me.

37:42.484 --> 37:45.920
My mother killed
herself because of you.

37:45.987 --> 37:48.856
You used her, and then
you threw her away!

37:48.924 --> 37:49.857
Reagan hear him out.

37:49.925 --> 37:51.692
He deserves that much.

37:51.760 --> 37:56.195
All that man deserves is
pain, the same kind that

37:56.263 --> 37:58.364
he caused us.

37:58.432 --> 37:59.365
I want to help you.

37:59.433 --> 38:00.366
No!

38:00.434 --> 38:02.902
Don't.

38:02.970 --> 38:04.303
Just give us
the baby Reagan.

38:04.371 --> 38:07.907
I'm taking your
baby, and your money.

38:07.975 --> 38:10.075
<i>I'm going somewhere warm.</i>

38:10.142 --> 38:12.911
Somewhere a blue eyed infant
will get adopted in a snap.

38:12.979 --> 38:14.446
No!

38:14.514 --> 38:16.515
It doesn't matter who, as
long as you don't have her.

38:18.117 --> 38:19.317
Come on!

38:19.385 --> 38:21.453
Ok.

38:21.521 --> 38:24.889
I don't want to have to
hurt her, but I will.

38:24.957 --> 38:26.457
I know you don't
want to hurt her.

38:26.525 --> 38:28.158
What do you want Reagan?

38:28.226 --> 38:31.762
<i>[esp]: Nobody cares what</i>
<i>I want, no one has ever cared.</i>

38:31.830 --> 38:34.632
Just give me the baby.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.333
Give me your sister.

38:36.401 --> 38:39.169
She has everything,
and I have nothing.

38:39.237 --> 38:44.073
I didn't do right by you
Reagan, or your mother.

38:44.141 --> 38:50.814
But if you let me,
I'm willing to try.

38:50.882 --> 38:56.819
[♪]

38:56.887 --> 38:58.554
How is she? Is she ok?

38:58.622 --> 39:02.057
She's alright.

39:02.125 --> 39:03.458
She's fine.

39:03.527 --> 39:06.161
Yeah, she' good.

39:06.229 --> 39:07.863
It's alright,
it's alright.

39:07.931 --> 39:13.601
[♪]

39:13.669 --> 39:16.604
What's going to
happen to my daughter?

39:16.672 --> 39:21.743
There will be
kidnapping charges.

39:21.810 --> 39:25.312
What if I was to
testify on her behalf?

39:25.380 --> 39:32.853
[♪]

39:32.921 --> 39:35.188
Thank you.

39:47.333 --> 39:48.634
Nice.

39:48.702 --> 39:50.135
This gym has missed
your presence Mr. Bey.

39:50.203 --> 39:51.637
Yeah, well I think it's
time I started using this

39:51.705 --> 39:53.138
thing as more than just
a foot stool, you know?

39:53.206 --> 39:54.907
So, can I work in?

39:54.975 --> 39:56.842
No problem.

39:56.910 --> 39:58.844
So your guy got
discharged yesterday.

39:58.912 --> 40:00.245
You know I think if that
heart attack was supposed

40:00.313 --> 40:02.781
to be a wake up call, he
didn't get the message.

40:02.848 --> 40:05.283
Maybe the wake up
call wasn't for him?

40:05.350 --> 40:06.651
What do you mean?

40:06.719 --> 40:08.987
Well, You were saying he
had unfinished business,

40:09.055 --> 40:13.491
maybe that was to inspire
the man that saved his life.

40:13.559 --> 40:15.460
Huh.

40:15.527 --> 40:18.161
Hadn't really thought
about it that way.

40:18.229 --> 40:20.263
Well you know
what you gotta do?

40:20.331 --> 40:22.265
Put on more weight?

40:22.333 --> 40:23.934
Hmm, Like on the bar...

40:24.002 --> 40:26.169
- I understand Mr. Bey.
- Ok... I got it.

40:26.237 --> 40:29.473
Alright here we go, ok.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.842
I like to see a
man push himself.

40:31.910 --> 40:33.076
The iron never
lies, right sir?

40:33.143 --> 40:34.077
Mmmhmm.

40:34.144 --> 40:35.612
Here we go. Ok.

40:35.679 --> 40:38.047
[struggle, panting]

40:38.115 --> 40:39.448
Come on!

40:39.516 --> 40:40.717
One, that's one, right?

40:40.784 --> 40:43.185
Yes, that's one Mr. Bey.

40:43.253 --> 40:44.453
Ok, could you get
under there please?

40:44.521 --> 40:45.454
Ok, I got it.

40:45.522 --> 40:46.756
It's ok, let go...

40:48.191 --> 40:49.491
Ok, come back in?

40:49.558 --> 40:50.558
Ok.

40:50.627 --> 40:52.894
I've had enough Mr. Bey.

40:52.962 --> 40:54.162
I got it sir.

40:55.397 --> 40:56.764
How are you?

40:56.832 --> 40:59.934
Well, the great thing
about the media circus

41:00.002 --> 41:03.270
around a rescued baby is
that nobody cares about a

41:03.338 --> 41:04.772
woman and a sketchbook.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.573
Even though she's the one
who cracked the case.

41:06.642 --> 41:09.309
Shh! If anybody asks,
you don't know me.

41:09.377 --> 41:12.278
So, will we see each
other again do you think?

41:12.346 --> 41:16.049
Divining the future, Toby,
you figure that one out,

41:16.117 --> 41:17.517
you let me know eh?

41:17.584 --> 41:19.519
Alright.
