00:01.167 --> 00:02.770
PREVIOUSLY ON
"CHASING LIFE..."

00:03.003 --> 00:04.538
THOMAS CARVER?
LIKE THE NOVELIST?

00:04.572 --> 00:06.774
- DAD?
- YEAH.

00:07.006 --> 00:09.609
- WHO'S NATALIE ORTIZ?
- ( camera clicks )

00:09.643 --> 00:11.711
April: I FELL ASLEEP
ON THE T LAST NIGHT.

00:11.746 --> 00:14.314
1:00 AM, END OF
THE LINE, MISS.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.648
Doctor: I'LL WRITE
YOU A PRESCRIPTION

00:15.682 --> 00:18.118
- TO PREVENT INFECTION.
- SURPRISE!

00:18.152 --> 00:20.153
UM...

00:20.187 --> 00:22.722
- SO YOU PLAY TENNIS?
- YEAH, WHY?

00:24.158 --> 00:26.460
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING, LOSER?

00:26.493 --> 00:27.661
BECAUSE I'M A LESBIAN
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE

00:27.695 --> 00:29.629
- ALL ANGRY LIKE YOU?
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.298
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE WITH MOM AT TANGO.

00:32.332 --> 00:34.468
OKAY, I'M WRONG.
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

00:34.502 --> 00:36.137
I HAVE CANCER!

00:46.112 --> 00:48.415
( both laugh )

00:48.448 --> 00:50.683
- YES, HEADS, I WIN.
- FLIP AGAIN.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.319
COME ON, YOU'RE
SUCH A SORE LOSER.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.353
WHY DON'T YOU
WANT TO DO THIS?

00:53.387 --> 00:55.289
BECAUSE PSYCHICS
ARE A TOTAL SCAM.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.689
I KNOW.
IT'LL BE HILARIOUS.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.125
- COME ON.
- NO, JUST ONE MORE TIME.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.826
IF IT'S HEADS,
I'LL GO IN.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.736
- HEADS AGAIN.
- MY GOD.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.572
- COME ON, IT'S A SIGN.
- I DON'T BELIEVE IN SIGNS.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.340
- IT'S A SIGN.
- I DON'T BELIEVE IN SIGNS.

01:13.373 --> 01:15.308
ARE YOU SCARED SHE'LL
TELL YOU WHEN YOU'RE
GONNA DIE OR SOMETHING?

01:15.341 --> 01:18.545
WELL, I--
I MEAN...

01:18.579 --> 01:19.847
KIND OF.

01:27.620 --> 01:30.123
OH, LOOK AT YOU.

01:30.156 --> 01:32.325
( chuckles )

01:32.359 --> 01:34.594
WELL, YOU LOOK
LIKE MODELS.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.597
WELL, SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.
THERE'S NO RUNWAY HERE.

01:44.103 --> 01:47.841
YOU SORE? LUCKY GIRL.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.409
- ( laughs )
- HMM.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.179
OKAY, COME ON, COME ON.
COME, COME, COME.

01:52.212 --> 01:55.182
OH-- OH.

01:55.216 --> 01:58.451
INTELLIGENCE, PASSIONATE,

01:58.485 --> 02:00.754
YOU TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOURSELF.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.188
NICE NAILS.

02:02.222 --> 02:04.191
WICKED NUMBER
OF GIRLFRIENDS

02:04.224 --> 02:06.126
BEFORE YOU.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.828
YOU CAN TELL THAT
FROM HIS HAND?

02:07.861 --> 02:10.129
NAH, FROM HIS FACE.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.198
HE'S GORGEOUS.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.399
OH, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

02:12.432 --> 02:14.200
YOU WERE TAKING ME
TO SEE YOUR MOM.

02:14.235 --> 02:17.170
OH, THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER HERE.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.507
SHE MOVE OR SOMETHING?

02:19.539 --> 02:21.408
MOVE? UH, NO.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.510
HA, YOU GOT ISSUES
WITH YOUR MOM,

02:23.544 --> 02:26.447
BUT YOU'RE VERY CLOSE
TO YOUR BROTHERS.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.716
- I'M AN ONLY CHILD.
- MEH.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.651
UH, ACTUALLY, I'M GOOD.

02:31.685 --> 02:32.853
OH, NO, NO.

02:32.887 --> 02:34.687
NO.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.525
YOU'RE NOT.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.560
YOU'RE TIRED.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.195
NOW YOU SOUND
LIKE MY MOTHER.

02:42.228 --> 02:45.932
AH, OH, YOUR FUTURE'S
REAL MESSED UP,

02:46.165 --> 02:47.668
BUT-- BUT IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.769
YOU CAN FIX IT.

02:48.801 --> 02:51.204
YOU WANT A HEALTHY FUTURE?

02:51.237 --> 02:53.307
YOU GOT TO DIG
INTO YOUR PAST.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.211
GO TALK TO YOUR SISTERS.

02:57.243 --> 03:01.215
I ONLY HAVE ONE SISTER.

03:01.247 --> 03:05.252
OH, WELL,
TALK TO HER THEN.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.854
TRUST ME, IT'S CRUCIAL.

03:11.658 --> 03:14.193
WELL, AT LEAST SHE
GOT ONE THING RIGHT.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.462
YOU HAVE A SISTER.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.900
YEAH, I'M SO GLAD
I PAID HER 30 BUCKS
TO TELL ME THAT.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.769
I PAID HER 30 BUCKS.

03:21.801 --> 03:22.969
THEN THE JOKE'S ON YOU.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.671
YOU KNOW THERE
ARE CHILDREN, LIKE,

03:24.704 --> 03:27.574
- STARVING EVERYWHERE.
- MAYBE ONE OF THEM'S
YOUR SISTER.

03:27.608 --> 03:28.876
DID YOU CHECK IN
WITH HER, YET?

03:28.908 --> 03:30.544
BECAUSE IT'S CRUCIAL.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.978
WHILE I DO THAT,
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY

03:32.211 --> 03:34.381
GO DEAL WITH
YOUR MOMMY ISSUES.

04:09.984 --> 04:12.286

YOU BURNT THOSE.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.455
I JUST DO THAT

I'M HUMAN.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.560
YOU PUT YOUR BELT

04:21.728 --> 04:22.762
WE DON'T READ

04:22.795 --> 04:24.932
WE LIKE TO THINK
OUTSIDE THE BOX.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.802
WEAR YOUR SUNGLASSES
AROUND YOUR NECK?

- YOU BOUGHT THESE FOR ME.
- AS A JOKE.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.774
WELL, THE JOKE IS ON YOU.
I LIKE THESE.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.776
YOU STARTED WITHOUT ME.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.411
TIME AND HUNGER
WAIT FOR NO ONE.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.850
YOU GUYS, KATIE
JUST EMAILED ME.

04:42.882 --> 04:44.018
AND SHE CAN'T MOVE
INTO THE APARTMENT

04:44.050 --> 04:45.351
FOR ANOTHER TWO MONTHS NOW.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.819
I MEAN, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO

04:46.853 --> 04:47.920
ABOUT RENT MONEY?
MY INTERNSHIP

04:47.954 --> 04:49.490
BARELY PAYS ENOUGH
FOR MY METRO CARD.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.557
HEY, WINTER'S OVER.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.593
WE'LL JUST GET YOU
A SLEEPING BAG.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.060
DAD, SERIOUSLY.

04:54.293 --> 04:55.062
- I'M STRESSING OUT.
- I KNOW.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.829
I'M TRYING TO REASSURE YOU.

04:56.863 --> 04:58.399
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PLACES
TO STAY IN NEW YORK

04:58.432 --> 05:00.401
THAT DON'T REQUIRE RENT:

05:00.434 --> 05:02.569
CENTRAL PARK,
STEPS OF THE MET,

05:02.603 --> 05:04.971
OOH, OOH, THAT
24-HOUR BODEGA

05:05.004 --> 05:06.774
ON 71st ST.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.875
HONEY, WE CAN HELP YOU OUT
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.

05:08.908 --> 05:12.646
APE, YOU'RE
GONNA BE FINE.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.449
JUST REMEMBER
WHAT I ALWAYS SAY.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.350
WHAT?

05:16.382 --> 05:17.651
APRIL, HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

05:17.685 --> 05:19.987
I'M FINE.
WHAT, DAD?

05:20.019 --> 05:21.588
APRIL?!

05:26.860 --> 05:28.928
Sara:
APRIL, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

05:28.961 --> 05:30.029
APRIL?

05:30.064 --> 05:31.665
HONEY, GET HER SOME WATER?

05:31.699 --> 05:35.002
SWEETHEART...

05:35.034 --> 05:37.838
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- WHAT HAPPENED?

05:37.870 --> 05:40.340
HAVE A BITE
OF YOUR TOAST.

05:40.374 --> 05:43.009
I THINK YOU JUST FAINTED.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.644
DO YOU REMEMBER
FEELING LIGHT-HEADED?

05:46.012 --> 05:49.983
I-- I DON'T THINK
I ATE ENOUGH LAST NIGHT.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.451
AND I DIDN'T
DRINK ENOUGH WATER.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.021
AND I HAD WAY
TOO MUCH COFFEE.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.557
HONEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.026
YEAH, TIME AND HUNGER
WAIT FOR NO WOMAN.

05:59.058 --> 06:01.627
IT MEANS YOU'RE PUSHING
YOURSELF TOO HARD.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.062
I WANT YOU
TO STAY HOME TODAY.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.666
- MOM, I'M FINE.
- IT WILL NOT KILL YOU
TO MISS A DAY.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.968
PLEASE DON'T MAKE
THIS A BIG DEAL.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.103
I'M NOT MAKING
THIS A BIG DEAL.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.137
YOUR BODY IS TELLING
YOU TO SLOW DOWN.

06:11.370 --> 06:14.074
SO I WILL MOVE SLOWER.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.379
SEE? ALL BETTER.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.521
WHAT'S WRONG?

06:27.553 --> 06:29.723
CAN YOU CHECK THE BANDAGE?

06:29.757 --> 06:30.957
I WANT TO SEE
HOW IT'S HEALING.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.495
IT LOOKS OKAY,
I THINK.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.928
OH, THANK YOU.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.730
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

06:37.764 --> 06:38.999
ARE YOU OKAY?

06:39.031 --> 06:40.733
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S SICK.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.103
BUT YOU LOOKED
PRETTY FREAKED OUT
BACK THERE.

06:43.137 --> 06:48.875
WHEN I WALKED IN THE KITCHEN,
IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE...

06:48.908 --> 06:50.944
OH, BRENNA.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.012
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.649
WHEN CAN WE TELL MOM?

06:55.682 --> 06:57.584
SOON, I SHOULD GET
THE RESULTS FROM THE TEST

06:57.617 --> 06:58.651
TODAY OR TOMORROW.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.821
AND IF IT'S
A GOOD PROGNOSIS,

07:00.853 --> 07:02.422
WHICH I'M SURE
IT WILL BE,

07:02.456 --> 07:03.624
I LEAD WITH THAT.

07:03.656 --> 07:04.658
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO WORRY MOM

07:04.690 --> 07:05.692
MORE THAN WE HAVE TO.

07:07.026 --> 07:09.629
Sara: MOM, APRIL FAINTED.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.497
WHEN?
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

07:11.531 --> 07:14.067
JUST NOW-- YEAH, NO.
SHE SAYS SHE'S FINE.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.202
BUT, I DON'T KNOW,
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

07:16.435 --> 07:19.005
SHE'S TIRED ALL THE TIME.
SHE'S LOST WEIGHT.

07:19.038 --> 07:20.774
SHE'S BEEN SO MOODY.

07:20.807 --> 07:23.442
WELL, SHE'S BEEN
WORKING A LOT LATELY.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.045
WELL, THE OTHER DAY,
I WALKED INTO HER ROOM.

07:25.077 --> 07:26.713
AND I SAW HER STICKING
SOMETHING IN HER DRAWER

07:26.747 --> 07:28.182
LIKE SHE WAS TRYING
TO HIDE IT FROM ME.

07:28.214 --> 07:29.750
DID YOU LOOK
IN THE DRAWER?

07:29.783 --> 07:30.783
NO! I--

07:30.817 --> 07:33.086
I DON'T SNOOP
ON MY DAUGHTERS.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.721
IT'S YOUR RIGHT
AS A MOTHER.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.689
JUST GO THROUGH
ALL HER STUFF.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.925
I DID IT WHEN
YOU WERE HER AGE.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.127
YOU DID?

07:41.161 --> 07:43.629
NICE BONG, BY THE WAY.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.966
I BET YOU ALWAYS WONDERED
WHERE IT WENT.

07:51.103 --> 07:54.106
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WENT
TO A PSYCHIC WITHOUT ME,
BITCH.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.242
SO WHAT DID SHE SAY?

07:56.475 --> 07:58.644
OH, JUST A BUNCH
OF GENERIC STUFF

07:58.678 --> 08:01.081
THAT APPLIES TO EVERYONE,
LIKE...

08:01.113 --> 08:02.983
( Brooklyn accent )
YOU NEED TO HEAL YOUR PAST.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.052
( both giggle )

08:05.084 --> 08:07.053
SHE DID SAY THAT I SHOULD
TALK TO MY SISTER, THOUGH.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.122
SO I CHECKED IN WITH
BRENNA JUST IN CASE.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.757
YEAH, HOW IS SHE?

08:10.790 --> 08:12.992
I MEAN, SHE SAYS
SHE'S FINE, BUT...

08:13.026 --> 08:14.995
BUT SHE'S NOT GONNA
TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.797
YOU KNOW, I BET SHE'D
TELL ME, THOUGH.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.130
I MEAN, WE ARE
THE ONLY TWO MEMBERS

08:18.165 --> 08:19.932
OF APRIL'S
"SECRET CANCER CLUB."

08:21.067 --> 08:22.134
I'LL CALL A MEETING.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.036
THE PSYCHIC ACTUALLY SAID

08:23.069 --> 08:25.605
I SHOULD TALK
TO MY "SISTERS."

08:25.639 --> 08:28.074
WHAT IF SHE MEANT, LIKE,
MY SECRET SISTER?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.976
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
EVEN ASKING THAT QUESTION,

08:30.009 --> 08:31.177
MEANS YOU'RE
CURIOUS ABOUT IT.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.913
ALL I KNOW IS HER NAME--
NATALIE ORTIZ--

08:33.947 --> 08:35.215
AND I WISH I DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW THAT.

08:35.249 --> 08:38.619
WHY ARE YOU SO SCARED TO
KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS GIRL?

08:38.652 --> 08:40.120
HONESTLY, IT'S NOT HER

08:40.153 --> 08:42.221
I'M SCARED
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT.

09:30.836 --> 09:33.105
( chattering )

09:35.908 --> 09:37.711
HEY.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.178
YOU REMEMBER THAT NAME
YOU GOT OFF A LICENSE PLATE

09:39.211 --> 09:41.914
LAST WEEK
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION?

09:41.948 --> 09:43.984
NATALIE ORTIZ: 22BH38?

09:44.017 --> 09:46.119
- HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
- HARVARD.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.754
I NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING
YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT HER.

09:48.788 --> 09:51.892
INTRIGUING.
I'LL HELP FOR A PRICE.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.161
I'M BROKE.

09:54.193 --> 09:55.861
PLEASE, I DON'T
CARE ABOUT MONEY.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.898
I WANT AN ADDITIONAL
REPORTING BI-CREDIT.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.701
FINE, DEAL.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.201
NATALIE ORTIZ
RENTED THE CAR

10:02.235 --> 10:05.038
AT LOGAN ON APRIL 12th,
PROVIDENT CAR RENTALS.

10:05.072 --> 10:08.008
( mutters )
OKAY.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.110
THAT'S IT,
BUT I'LL DIG FOR MORE

10:10.143 --> 10:12.144
IF YOU TELL RAQUEL THAT
YOU AND I HOOKED UP ONCE

10:12.178 --> 10:14.947
AND I WAS AWESOME.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.783
UH, NO,
AS TEMPTING AS THAT IS.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.286
REALLY, I THINK
I GOT IT FROM HERE.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.738
HEY, WHERE'RE YOU HEADING?

10:37.770 --> 10:40.774
UH, OUT. I'M JUST
DOING SOME RESEARCH.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.109
YOU GOT A SECOND
TO TALK?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.411
S-- S-- SURE.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.315
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.350
I JUST WANT US
TO BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.786
UNLOAD WHATEVER BAGGAGE
THAT WE HAVE.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.421
OKAY.

10:54.653 --> 10:55.721
SO YOU KNOW WHEN
THE PSYCHIC SAID

10:55.755 --> 10:57.024
THAT I HAD MOM ISSUES?

10:57.057 --> 10:58.191
YEAH, THAT WAS CRAZY.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.793
I MEAN, WHO DOESN'T
HAVE MOM ISSUES?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.995
- OR DAD ISSUES?
- I KNOW, BUT...

11:02.028 --> 11:03.964
MINE ARE PRETTY MAJOR.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.932
I FELT LIKE IT WAS TOO SOON
TO TELL YOU THIS BEFORE, BUT...

11:07.900 --> 11:09.802
MY MOM'S IN PRISON.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.804
- SHUT UP.
- SERIOUSLY.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.907
OH, REALLY?
THAT'S FUNNY, ACTUALLY.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.008
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO TELL YOU

11:15.042 --> 11:16.043
THAT MY GRANDMA'S
A STRIPPER.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.815
I'M SORRY.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.383
I REALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE JOKING.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.085
- IT'S--
- UM...

11:25.118 --> 11:26.852
IT'S FINE.
I KNOW IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS.

11:26.886 --> 11:30.890
WHAT IS SHE IN FOR?

11:30.923 --> 11:33.125
SHE WAS A BOOKKEEPER
FOR THIS GUY

11:33.159 --> 11:34.727
WHO EMBEZZLED MONEY.

11:34.760 --> 11:38.798
SHE WENT ALONG WITH IT
SO SHE'S IN FOR A YEAR.

11:38.831 --> 11:41.434
ARE YOU OKAY?

11:41.467 --> 11:44.904
YEAH, I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU EARLIER.

11:44.937 --> 11:48.442
YOU THINK THAT'S BAGGAGE?

11:48.475 --> 11:50.376
I'LL SHOW YOU BAGGAGE.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.486
( laughs )

12:00.720 --> 12:02.022
HOW ARE WE THE ONLY
GIRLS AT SCHOOL

12:02.054 --> 12:03.923
WHO REALIZE
TOPKNOTS ARE LAME?

12:03.956 --> 12:05.792
IT'S LIKE-- I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU LOOK LIKE

12:05.826 --> 12:07.827
A SUMO WRESTLER.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.029
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

12:10.062 --> 12:11.798
TOPKNOTS ARE USUALLY
YOUR FAVORITE TOPIC.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.899
I JUST HAD A REALLY
SUCKY MORNING.

12:13.933 --> 12:14.934
OH MY GOD, ME TOO.

12:14.967 --> 12:16.503
I TUNED IN
TO THIS RADIO SHOW

12:16.735 --> 12:19.773
LIKE RIGHT AFTER
THEY CALLED THIS GUY.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.107
THEY WERE LIKE YOU CAN
SEND A DOZEN ROSES

12:21.140 --> 12:22.475
TO THE WOMAN
OF YOUR CHOOSING.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.909
GUESS WHO HE CHOSE.

12:23.943 --> 12:25.378
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S MOM,

12:25.412 --> 12:27.246
LIKE THEY ARE DATING.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.448
I'M SO MAD I MISSED IT.

12:31.217 --> 12:34.086
OH MY GOD, GREER DANVILLE
IS HEADING OVER HERE.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.222
AND SHE'S WEARING
A TOPKNOT.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.125
HI, BRENNA.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.225
HEY.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.527
WHEN I GET
THIS THING OFF,

12:40.759 --> 12:42.062
I TOTALLY WANT
A REMATCH.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.963
YEAH, MAYBE.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.499
( bell rings )

12:48.902 --> 12:50.136
OR NOT.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.875
UM, WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

12:55.908 --> 12:57.277
UM, TENNIS.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.011
I HUSTLED HER ASS
SO THAT SHE WOULD

12:59.044 --> 13:00.514
DO OUR HISTORY HOMEWORK
FOR US.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.884
NICE, BEAT 'EM
AT THEIR OWN GAMES.

13:03.917 --> 13:04.850
SWEET.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.124
NEXT.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.092
OKAY, SO WHICH
BAGGAGE IS HEAVIER?

13:13.125 --> 13:15.961
SECRET SISTER
OR MOM IN PRISON?

13:15.995 --> 13:18.565
HMM, RIGHT NOW,
MOM IN PRISON,

13:18.798 --> 13:20.500
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
WE KNOW IT'S TRUE.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.903
IF WE FIND OUT THIS GIRL
IS DEFINITELY MY SISTER,

13:22.936 --> 13:25.404
THEN I WIN.
AND BY WIN, I MEAN LOSE

13:25.437 --> 13:26.907
IN LIFE.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.875
I FEEL LIKE
A SPY RIGHT NOW.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.911
A REAL SPY WOULD
NEVER SAY THAT.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.044
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:32.077 --> 13:34.213
A REAL SPY WOULD JUST
GET INTO CHARACTER.

13:34.246 --> 13:37.250
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE?

13:37.283 --> 13:39.519
- NEXT.
- LOSE THE SMILES.
SPIES DON'T SMILE.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.121
HI, MY NAME
IS NATALIE ORTIZ.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.290
AND MY PURSE
GOT STOLEN YESTERDAY.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.592
I LOST MY IDs
AND MY CREDIT CARDS

13:46.826 --> 13:48.827
AND THE RECEIPT FOR
A CAR THAT I RENTED

13:48.861 --> 13:50.129
FROM YOU GUYS
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.164
AND MY WORK WON'T
REIMBURSE ME WITHOUT IT.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.933
SO I WAS REALLY HOPING MAYBE
YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME--

13:53.966 --> 13:55.534
FILL THIS OUT.
WE WILL MAIL YOU
THE RECEIPT

13:55.568 --> 13:57.136
IN FIVE TO SEVEN
BUSINESS DAYS.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.173
NEXT.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.341
OH MY G--

14:02.375 --> 14:04.244
NATALIE,
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.879
- YEAH.
- I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE BABY.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.615
- LET'S SEE THE DOCTOR.
- OH, WE CAN'T AFFORD IT

14:08.847 --> 14:09.883
UNTIL I GET REIMBURSED.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.918
I JUST-- ( gasps )
IT'S OKAY.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.186
JUST A FEW MORE DAYS.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.587
YOU SAID FIVE
TO SEVEN, RIGHT?

14:14.620 --> 14:15.621
( groans )

14:15.855 --> 14:18.091
WHEN DID YOU RENT
THE CAR, MS. ORTIZ?

14:18.124 --> 14:19.993
APRIL 12th.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.897
TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION

14:23.929 --> 14:26.298
IF YOU PROMISE YOU'LL GO
SEE A DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY.

14:26.332 --> 14:29.201
OH, I WILL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.243
YOU'RE WAY TOO
GOOD OF A LIAR.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.913
WHAT?

14:39.946 --> 14:42.615
NATALIE LIVES IN KEY LARGO

14:42.649 --> 14:47.386
ON THE SAME STREET AS
MY DAD'S WRITING RETREAT.

14:47.419 --> 14:50.023
IS THERE ANY WORLD
WHERE IT'S A COINCIDENCE?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.591
I HOPE SO.

14:51.625 --> 14:54.394
SHE'S TWO YEARS
YOUNGER THAN ME.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.196
IF SHE IS MY DAD'S DAUGHTER,

14:56.229 --> 14:59.499
THEN HE DEFINITELY
CHEATED ON MY MOM.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.344
SO WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

15:11.378 --> 15:12.979
I DON'T KNOW.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.981
ANY PROOF THAT THIS GIRL
REALLY KNEW MY DAD.

15:17.149 --> 15:19.019
YOU REALLY THINK YOUR DAD
WOULD HAVE JUST LEFT IT

15:19.052 --> 15:21.020
WITH HIS STUFF
FOR ANYONE TO FIND?

15:21.053 --> 15:22.221
I DON'T KNOW.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.157
THIS IS ALL OF HIS STUFF
FROM HIS FLORIDA HOUSE.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.926
WHEN HE DIED, WE JUST
HAD IT SHIPPED HERE.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.036
- WHAT'S THAT?
- HIS RESEARCH NOTEBOOK.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.038
HE STARTED A NEW ONE

15:38.071 --> 15:39.205
EVERY TIME
HE WROTE A NEW BOOK.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.341
AND THIS IS FROM
HIS LAST ONE.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.010
AND HIS LAST TRIP.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.147
( chuckles )

15:47.179 --> 15:49.182
OH.

15:49.215 --> 15:50.950
IS THIS YOU?

15:50.984 --> 15:54.287
( laughs )

15:54.321 --> 15:56.022
WHAT? IT WAS
AN AWKWARD PHASE.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.356
THAT'S SO CUTE.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.491
DEFINITELY LIKE YOU BETTER
WITH LONG HAIR.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.061
WELL...

16:01.094 --> 16:03.096
I SOMETIMES LIKE
TO GO SHORT.

16:06.466 --> 16:10.636
( both laugh )

16:10.669 --> 16:12.971
OH MY GOD.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.407
IS THAT...

16:15.708 --> 16:19.511
IT'S NATALIE
WITH MY DAD...

16:21.347 --> 16:23.015
AND MY UNCLE GEORGE.

16:31.658 --> 16:36.363
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
HE PRETENDED

16:36.395 --> 16:39.164
TO BE THIS GREAT DAD.

16:39.198 --> 16:40.533
WHO WAS HE?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.168
YEAH, OF COURSE
YOU KNEW HIM.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.703
A PERSON CAN HAVE SECRETS
AND STILL BE THE SAME PERSON

16:44.738 --> 16:46.172
YOU THINK THEY ARE.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.173
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.
I'M THE SAME PERSON

16:48.207 --> 16:50.076
I WAS BEFORE
I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY MOM.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.111
NOW WHAT CAN
I DO TO HELP?

16:52.144 --> 16:54.047
NOTHING.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.383
I JUST-- I NEED TO TALK
TO THE ONLY PERSON I CAN

16:56.415 --> 16:58.418
- RIGHT NOW. MY UNCLE.
- ( phone beeps )

17:02.020 --> 17:04.457
- WHAT?
- DANNY JUST SENT ME THIS.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.192
Dominic: WHAT'S DANNY
DOING WITH THAT WOMAN?

17:06.226 --> 17:07.794
THAT WOMAN IS MY MOM.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.230
AND WHAT'S SHE DOING
AT MY DESK?

17:24.477 --> 17:27.713
OKAY, YOU'RE EITHER
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING
GETTING A "YOLO" TATTOO

17:27.747 --> 17:29.214
OR YOU'RE UPSET
ABOUT SOMETHING.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.317
I'M SORRY.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.185
I JUST FOUND OUT
SOMETHING PRETTY BIG

17:33.219 --> 17:35.288
AND I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.189
WHAT IS IT?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.657
MY SISTER HAS
LEUKEMIA.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.794
APRIL?

17:40.826 --> 17:42.694
BUT SHE'S SO YOUNG.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.800
I'M SORRY, BUT THERE
HAS TO BE SOMETHING

17:47.834 --> 17:49.169
IN OUR ENVIRONMENT
THAT'S CAUSING THIS.

17:49.201 --> 17:50.336
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
IT'S CELLPHONES,

17:50.369 --> 17:52.238
PRESERVATIVES,
OR WHAT.

17:52.271 --> 17:53.472
BUT SOMETHING'S
CHANGING OUR DNA.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.773
YOU KNOW?
LIKE AS A SOCIETY.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.809
ALL I KNOW IS SHE'S SICK.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.147
I'M SORRY.
THERE'S JUST--

18:02.182 --> 18:04.284
THERE'S NO WAY THE GOVERNMENT
ISN'T AWARE OF THIS.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.653
Beth: HEY.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.521
BETH, HI.

18:09.556 --> 18:12.258
I AM LOVING THE EYEBALL
THEME IN HERE.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.160
OH, THANKS.
THAT WAS MY IDEA.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.496
THIS IS KIERAN.
BETH IS MY SISTER'S FRIEND.

18:16.528 --> 18:18.631
AND YOURS.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

18:18.664 --> 18:21.233
I THOUGHT WE COULD TALK
ABOUT THAT THING THAT
YOUR SISTER TOLD US

18:21.267 --> 18:23.336
THAT WE'RE BOTH
DEALING WITH.

18:23.368 --> 18:25.637
IT'S OKAY. DON'T REALLY
NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.340
HE KNOWS,
BY THE WAY.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.175
OH. OKAY.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.578
WELL, LOOK, MY PLAN B
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT

18:32.612 --> 18:35.515
WAS TO HELP YOU GET
YOUR MIND OFF IT.

18:35.548 --> 18:39.285
THERE'S AN OUTDOOR SCREENING
OF "PRETTY IN PINK" TONIGHT.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.490
OH, GOD.

18:43.522 --> 18:45.424
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS, DO YOU?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.259
I'M SO OLD.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.560
NO, UNFORTUNATELY
I DO KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.363
IT'S MY MOM'S
FAVORITE.

18:50.395 --> 18:55.768
CLEARLY YOUR MOTHER MUST BE
SOMEONE OF IMPECCABLE TASTE.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.170
COME ON,
YOU CAN BOTH COME

18:57.202 --> 18:59.172
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU DON'T LOVE THE MOVIE,

18:59.204 --> 19:01.173
I WILL LET YOU GIVE ME
THE TATTOO OF YOUR CHOICE

19:01.207 --> 19:02.741
ON MY FACE.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.578
I MUST REALLY LIKE YOU.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.814
( chuckles )

19:07.846 --> 19:09.816
YAY.

19:15.555 --> 19:16.923
I THOUGHT IF I CALLED,

19:17.155 --> 19:19.893
YOU WOULD JUST TELL ME
YOU WERE TOO BUSY TO SEE ME.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.628
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:22.662 --> 19:23.796
WELL, WE HAVE TO TALK.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.469
AND I WANT TO
START BY SAYING

19:29.501 --> 19:31.203
THAT I LOVE YOU

19:31.237 --> 19:32.872
AND I'M HERE FOR YOU.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.673
OKAY.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.509
NOW YOU'RE
FREAKING ME OUT.

19:38.577 --> 19:39.746
I WAS CLEANING
YOUR ROOM TODAY

19:39.778 --> 19:41.447
AND I FOUND THESE.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.752
YOU HAVEN'T SEEMED
LIKE YOURSELF LATELY.

19:46.786 --> 19:47.686
YOU FAINTED.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.689
YOU'RE TIRED
ALL THE TIME.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.557
I MEAN,
WHAT ARE THEY?

19:51.590 --> 19:54.227
THEY'RE JUST
THESE SUPPLEMENTS

19:54.259 --> 19:56.328
THAT HELP KEEP ME GOING.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.697
I'VE BEEN WORKING
REALLY HARD.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.499
- YOU KNOW THAT.
- I DO,

19:59.531 --> 20:01.701
BUT I'VE GOT CLIENTS
WHO'VE GOTTEN ADDICTED
TO PILLS

20:01.733 --> 20:04.604
BECAUSE THEY ARE SO
DESPERATELY TRYING
TO KEEP GOING.

20:04.636 --> 20:07.574
I'D HATE TO SEE THAT
HAPPEN TO YOU.

20:07.606 --> 20:09.308
WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M LIKE ADDICTED?

20:09.342 --> 20:10.309
I'M NOT.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.510
THEN PROVE IT.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.778
STOP TAKING THEM.

20:12.811 --> 20:14.913
- MOM, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.916
EVERYONE EXPECTS ME
TO BE A CERTAIN WAY.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.987
AND IT'S NOT THAT EASY
TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING

20:21.220 --> 20:22.454
ALL THE TIME.

20:22.488 --> 20:23.823
I'M NOT LIKE SUPERHUMAN.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.724
HONEY, I WANT TO HELP.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.926
I KNOW, BUT I'M FINE.

20:27.961 --> 20:30.363
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ME.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.603
DJ: Attention Duckies
and Duckettes,

20:36.635 --> 20:37.971
grab your seats
and lower your hair

20:38.003 --> 20:39.872
because tonight's presentation
of "Pretty in Pink"

20:39.905 --> 20:42.674
will begin when
the sun goes down.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.977
ARE YOU LIKE
IN HELL RIGHT NOW?

20:44.009 --> 20:45.345
NO.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.279
I MAY LOSE A TESTICLE
JUST BY BEING HERE,

20:47.313 --> 20:49.648
BUT I AM HAPPY TO REPORT
THAT I DO HAVE ANOTHER ONE.

20:49.682 --> 20:50.950
MM.
( chuckles )

20:50.983 --> 20:53.552
SO WHAT DID I MISS?
WHO ELSE SUCKS?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.622
WHAT ELSE WOULD WE
RATHER BE DOING?

20:55.654 --> 20:58.691
NO, WE'RE HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.425
YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY
VERY INTERESTING

21:00.460 --> 21:01.794
FROM A SOCIOLOGICAL
POINT OF VIEW.

21:01.827 --> 21:03.695
JUST SO LONG AS IT'S
NOT ACTUALLY FUN,

21:03.730 --> 21:05.731
'CAUSE FUN WOULD BE
SO 2005.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.869
Kieran: OH, LOOK.
THERE'S MARTINA NAVRATILOVA.

21:12.270 --> 21:14.641
OH, DON'T TELL ME
YOU JUST SAID THAT

21:14.673 --> 21:16.808
BECAUSE SHE'S A LESBIAN
WHO PLAYS TENNIS?

21:16.843 --> 21:18.478
OKAY, I WON'T.

21:18.510 --> 21:20.813
Beth: MARTINA WOULD NEVER
WEAR AN OUTFIT LIKE THAT.

21:20.846 --> 21:22.749
YOUR OUTFIT'S AWESOME.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.653
- HEY.
- HI.

21:27.686 --> 21:31.324
SO YOU GUYS GO TO
SCHOOL TOGETHER?

21:31.356 --> 21:33.792
AND WE PLAY TENNIS
SOMETIMES.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.795
Beth:
WHY DON'T YOU SIT WITH US?

21:35.827 --> 21:37.296
I MEAN,
MAYBE IF YOU'RE HERE,

21:37.329 --> 21:38.931
I'LL HAVE SOMEONE TO ACTUALLY
ENJOY THE MOVIE WITH

21:38.964 --> 21:42.335
AND THEY WON'T TRY TO DO
INAPPROPRIATE THINGS
UNDER THE BLANKET.

21:42.367 --> 21:43.935
OH, YEAH, I SAW WHAT
WAS GOING ON BEFORE.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.704
I'M AUSTRALIAN,
NOT BLIND.

21:45.738 --> 21:49.075
I'M KIND OF WITH
A BIG GROUP.

21:49.307 --> 21:51.677
HEY,
COME SIT WITH US.

21:51.711 --> 21:52.979
WE HAVE
BETTER SEATS.

22:05.391 --> 22:07.693
OKAY, I'VE GOT A GAME
WE CAN PLAY WHEN
THE MOVIE STARTS.

22:07.727 --> 22:08.827
EVERY TIME BLAINE
SAYS THE WORD--

22:08.861 --> 22:10.096
NO.

22:10.328 --> 22:11.798
- BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN SAID--
- NO.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.700
- IT COULD BE
A LOT OF FUN--
- NO.

22:13.732 --> 22:16.635
SO WHAT ARE YOUR
FRIENDS GONNA THINK

22:16.669 --> 22:17.836
IF THEY SEE ME
SITTING WITH YOU?

22:17.869 --> 22:20.405
ISN'T THAT GONNA
RUIN YOUR CRED?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.709
I'M NOT TOO
WORRIED ABOUT IT.

22:22.741 --> 22:24.644
MY FRIENDS
ARE WAY TOO COOL

22:24.676 --> 22:26.878
TO COME TO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS, SO...

22:26.913 --> 22:29.048
( both chuckle )

22:38.356 --> 22:39.459
APRIL?

22:39.491 --> 22:41.626
THE BIOPSY RESULTS
HAVEN'T COME BACK YET,

22:41.661 --> 22:43.462
BUT WE CAN DISCUSS
YOUR OPTIONS?

22:43.496 --> 22:44.864
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THAT.

22:44.896 --> 22:47.467
BUT ON THE PHONE YOU SAID
YOU HAD SOME QUESTIONS?

22:47.500 --> 22:50.470
- ACTUALLY I JUST HAVE ONE.
- OKAY.

22:50.502 --> 22:51.971
WHO IS NATALIE ORTIZ?

22:56.843 --> 22:58.044
APRIL...

22:58.076 --> 23:00.613
SHE'S MY SISTER,
ISN'T SHE?

23:05.384 --> 23:06.618
YES.

23:06.652 --> 23:08.153
AND SHE'S
YOUNGER THAN ME,

23:08.386 --> 23:11.423
SO MY DAD CHEATED
ON MY MOM.

23:11.457 --> 23:14.093
THIS WAS NOT
AN ONGOING THING.

23:14.126 --> 23:17.096
WAS HE IN LOVE WITH HER?

23:22.734 --> 23:24.836
HE MET HER IN FLORIDA.

23:24.871 --> 23:27.606
HE WAS WORKING--
IT WAS SO LONG AGO.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.643
THE AFFAIR MAY HAVE
BEEN SO LONG AGO,

23:30.675 --> 23:32.778
BUT HE LIED
MY WHOLE LIFE.

23:32.811 --> 23:34.579
HE JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT YOU GUYS.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.115
YOU KNOW, HE WANTED
TO PROTECT YOU.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.518
HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.552
AND YOU PROTECTED HIM.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.989
I DIDN'T AGREE THAT HE
SHOULD KEEP THIS A SECRET.

23:43.021 --> 23:46.057
JUST LIKE I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE KEEPING YOUR
ILLNESS FROM YOUR MOTHER NOW.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.626
DON'T TURN THIS AROUND.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.095
APRIL, I'M SORRY.

23:49.127 --> 23:50.529
MAYBE I SHOULD
HAVE TOLD YOU.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.864
IT'S TOO LATE, GEORGE.

23:51.897 --> 23:53.432
LIKE YEARS TOO LATE.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.574
( crying )

24:13.451 --> 24:14.921
( both sigh )

24:16.588 --> 24:18.557
THANKS FOR MAKING
IT OUT TONIGHT.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.893
BE SURE TO COME BACK NEXT WEEK
FOR "THE CUTTING EDGE."

24:20.926 --> 24:22.595
'TOE-PICK.'

24:26.464 --> 24:29.634
SO MARK JUST TEXTED ME.
EVERYONE'S GOING TO HIS
PLACE TO GO WATCH THAT SHOW

24:29.669 --> 24:31.804
THAT GOES BEHIND-THE-SCENES
IN THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

24:31.837 --> 24:33.038
UH, NO, SORRY.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.707
I DRAW THE LINE AT
SLAUGHTERHOUSES.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.041
BRENNA YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME, OKAY?

24:36.075 --> 24:37.175
WE NEED GIRL TIME.

24:37.210 --> 24:39.578
- I'LL CALL YOU AFTER?
- ALL RIGHT.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.713
BETH,
THANKS FOR THE MOVIE.

24:41.747 --> 24:43.915
NEXT TIME I'LL MAKE SURE
IT'S IN BLACK AND WHITE.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.251
LIKE LIFE, BETH.
LIKE LIFE.

24:46.484 --> 24:47.486
BREN.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.691
GOODNIGHT, GREER.

24:51.723 --> 24:53.925
I THINK MY FRIENDS
ARE LEAVING.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.828
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
WATCH THE MOVIE WITH
YOU GUYS.

24:56.863 --> 24:59.065
I'M SO GLAD I WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE

24:59.097 --> 25:00.932
- THAT KNEW EVERY LINE.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

25:00.967 --> 25:03.035
HAVE I MENTIONED HOW MUCH
I LOVE YOUR DRESS?

25:03.068 --> 25:05.637
- A FEW TIMES.
- RIGHT.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.272
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

25:07.506 --> 25:08.641
YOU LIKE MY DRESS?

25:08.673 --> 25:11.076
THIS MAY COME AS
A SURPRISE TO YOU,

25:11.109 --> 25:12.944
BUT DRESSED AREN'T
EXACTLY MY THING.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.614
AW, COME ON.

25:14.646 --> 25:15.948
YOU'D LOOK
PRETTY IN PINK.

25:15.981 --> 25:17.616
( chuckles )
OH MY GOD.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.984
I'LL SEE YOU AT SCHOOL?

25:21.019 --> 25:22.622
YEAH.

25:22.654 --> 25:25.156
MAYBE THIS TIME WE CAN
ACTUALLY SAY HI TO EACH OTHER.

25:45.644 --> 25:46.645
( sighs )

25:48.614 --> 25:49.615
SARA.

25:49.648 --> 25:51.717
HELLO, GEORGE.

25:51.750 --> 25:55.186
( chuckles )
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

25:55.221 --> 25:58.790
WELL, I HATE TO SAY
I FOLLOWED APRIL HERE,

25:58.824 --> 26:00.326
BUT I DID.

26:00.558 --> 26:01.760
WE HAVE TO TALK.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.796
ABOUT APRIL?

26:05.163 --> 26:07.098
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THESE PILLS?

26:08.834 --> 26:10.102
ANSWER ME.

26:12.704 --> 26:14.339
LET ME JUST GET
MY BEARINGS HERE.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.008
SO YOU BARGE
INTO MY OFFICE

26:16.041 --> 26:17.276
AFTER NOT SPEAKING TO ME
FOR TWO YEARS,

26:17.309 --> 26:18.778
AND NOW YOU'RE
ACCUSING ME OF--

26:18.810 --> 26:20.046
WELL, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.614
YOU'RE RIGHT. NO ONE'S
SEEN YOU IN TWO YEARS,

26:21.646 --> 26:23.281
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
I FOUND OUT MY DAUGHTER

26:23.316 --> 26:25.017
IS COMING TO SEE YOU
AT THE SAME TIME

26:25.050 --> 26:26.618
HER LIFE IS
FALLING APART.

26:26.652 --> 26:27.953
I JUST CAN'T
HELP BUT THINK

26:27.987 --> 26:29.654
THAT'S MORE THAN
A COINCIDENCE.

26:30.588 --> 26:31.923
WHY WAS SHE HERE?

26:31.958 --> 26:37.163
SHE'S BEEN COMING
TO ME FOR ADVICE.

26:37.195 --> 26:38.931
ABOUT WHAT?

26:38.964 --> 26:41.299
IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO SAY.

26:41.334 --> 26:43.702
SORRY.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.837
BUT I'VE SAID ALL I CAN.

26:45.871 --> 26:48.840
IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT
ANY MORE ABOUT APRIL,

26:48.874 --> 26:50.175
I SUGGEST YOU
TALK TO HER.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.644
I'VE TRIED. SHE'S NOT
TELLING ME ANYTHING.

26:52.677 --> 26:54.680
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HER.

26:54.713 --> 26:55.815
I'M HER MOTHER.

26:55.847 --> 26:58.049
JUST...

26:58.084 --> 27:00.318
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT IS
HAPPENING WITH HER.

27:00.353 --> 27:02.188
I CAN'T--

27:02.221 --> 27:04.856
I CAN'T DO THIS BY MYSELF.
I'VE TRIED.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.359
AND I-- I CAN'T.

27:13.665 --> 27:15.334
YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEONE WHO
CONSIDERS HERSELF AN OUTSIDER,

27:15.367 --> 27:17.403
IT MUST BE NICE TO HAVE
EVERYONE LIKING YOU.

27:18.403 --> 27:21.073
YOU KNOW,
KIERAN AND GREER.

27:21.106 --> 27:22.407
GREER?

27:22.641 --> 27:24.210
YEAH, IT SEEMS LIKE
SHE'S INTO YOU.

27:24.242 --> 27:25.344
WHATEVER.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.212
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.714
IT'S NOT LIKE WE WOULD
EVER DATE OR ANYTHING.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.117
WHY, 'CAUSE OF KIERAN?
'CAUSE YOU'RE STRAIGHT?

27:32.151 --> 27:34.220
NO.

27:34.252 --> 27:37.222
KIERAN AND I AREN'T
LIKE EXCLUSIVE.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.892
AND I DON'T DEFINE MYSELF.

27:39.924 --> 27:41.227
WE'RE JUST SO DIFFERENT.

27:41.259 --> 27:43.895
WE'RE IN LIKE TOTALLY
DIFFERENT FRIEND GROUPS.

27:43.929 --> 27:46.031
WAIT, DIDN'T WE JUST
WATCH A WHOLE MOVIE

27:46.065 --> 27:47.432
ABOUT HOW THAT STUFF
DOESN'T MATTER?

27:47.665 --> 27:50.236
I MEAN, COME ON. SHE'S FUNNY,
SHE MAKES YOU LAUGH.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.371
AND RIGHT NOW WITH
EVERYTHING THAT'S
GOING ON,

27:52.404 --> 27:54.406
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
SUCH A BAD THING.

27:55.941 --> 27:57.442
YOU SEEM TO BE
HANDLING EVERYTHING

27:57.675 --> 27:58.743
REALLY WELL,
BY THE WAY.

27:58.778 --> 28:01.247
NOT REALLY.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.317
I'M A REALLY BAD SISTER.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.751
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

28:11.423 --> 28:14.059
WHEN I FIRST NOTICED
APRIL ACTING WEIRD

28:14.093 --> 28:16.162
AND KIND OF LOSING IT,

28:16.194 --> 28:19.464
I WAS BASICALLY
HAPPY ABOUT IT.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.035
I MEAN, SHE'S SO PERFECT
ALL THE TIME.

28:23.068 --> 28:26.404
AND IT WAS LIKE FINALLY
FOR A MINUTE SHE HAD PROBLEMS.

28:30.875 --> 28:34.180
AND THEN I FOUND OUT WHY.

28:34.212 --> 28:38.217
AND I FEEL LIKE THE WORST
PERSON IN THE WORLD.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.854
DON'T BE SO
HARD ON YOURSELF.

28:41.886 --> 28:45.790
I MEAN, THAT WHOLE
MISS PERFECT THING
IS SUPER ANNOYING.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.492
- ( chuckles )
- YEAH.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.327
I MEAN, HAVE YOU SEEN
HOW MANY CATEGORIES SHE
HAS IN HER EMAIL INBOX?

28:49.361 --> 28:51.329
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
I ONCE SAW HER FLAGGING

28:51.363 --> 28:53.398
ONE OF MY MESSAGES
AS PERSONAL.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.000
SHE'S SO WEIRD.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.268
I KNOW, RIGHT?

28:56.301 --> 28:58.938
DID YOU KNOW SHE KEEPS
HER SOCKS ORGANIZED BY COLOR?

28:58.971 --> 29:01.973
( laughs )
I ACTUALLY DID KNOW THAT.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.450
HEY, SARA.
IS APRIL HOME YET?

29:11.483 --> 29:14.819
UM, NO.
NO, NOT YET.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.855
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

29:16.888 --> 29:19.224
UH, SORRY, BETH.
THIS IS A FAMILY MATTER.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.227
YOU'LL HAVE TO VISIT
WITH APRIL ANOTHER TIME.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.394
OH, YEAH. OKAY.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.131
( sighs )

29:35.807 --> 29:38.877
Conductor:
Charles MGH Station.

29:40.412 --> 29:43.115
Charles MGH Station.

29:54.425 --> 29:55.426
I'M HOME.

30:01.432 --> 30:03.035
GEORGE?

30:05.436 --> 30:06.971
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:07.006 --> 30:09.141
I'VE CALLED
A FAMILY MEETING.

30:09.174 --> 30:10.442
WHY?

30:10.476 --> 30:13.412
APRIL,
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

30:14.445 --> 30:16.382
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.317
THIS IS AN INTERVENTION.

30:22.954 --> 30:25.290
IT'S TIME.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.159
EITHER YOU TELL THEM
OR I WILL.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.272
WE LOVE VERY MUCH,

30:41.307 --> 30:42.875
AND WE WANT TO GET YOU
THE HELP YOU NEED

30:42.907 --> 30:43.875
FOR YOUR ADDICTION.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.176
APRIL, TELL HER.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.011
TELL ME WHAT?

30:47.046 --> 30:49.515
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
I'M NOT ADDICTED TO DRUGS.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.884
( sighs )

30:57.890 --> 31:00.025
I HAVE LEUKEMIA.

31:01.227 --> 31:02.294
WHAT?

31:07.232 --> 31:09.602
I HAVE LEUKEMIA, MOM.

31:10.903 --> 31:13.372
I DON'T-- I'M--

31:14.973 --> 31:15.974
ARE YOU SURE?

31:17.009 --> 31:18.911
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

31:18.943 --> 31:21.480
OH MY GOD.
THIS ISN'T--

31:21.512 --> 31:22.981
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.148
DON'T WORRY.

31:24.182 --> 31:25.351
UNCLE GEORGE
CAUGHT IT EARLY

31:25.384 --> 31:27.318
AND I'M PROBABLY
GONNA BE FINE.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.020
WE'RE JUST WAITING
FOR THE RESULTS

31:29.054 --> 31:31.356
FROM MY BONE MARROW
BIOPSY,

31:31.390 --> 31:34.326
AND THEN WE'LL KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.894
HONEY...

31:36.929 --> 31:38.998
YOU'VE HAD TO GO THROUGH
THIS BY YOURSELF?

31:39.030 --> 31:41.165
- I TOLD BETH.
- AND ME.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.568
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO
STRESS EVERYONE OUT

31:43.602 --> 31:46.238
BEFORE WE KNEW
EXACTLY WHAT THIS WAS.

31:46.271 --> 31:47.905
I'M SORRY, MOM.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.907
I'M SORRY, GRANDMA.

31:49.942 --> 31:51.910
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
SWEETHEART.

31:51.943 --> 31:53.045
OR ME, HONEY.

31:53.077 --> 31:56.147
I JUST WANT TO
BE HERE FOR YOU.

31:56.181 --> 32:00.051
- MOM, MOM.
- ( crying )

32:00.085 --> 32:02.954
OH, MOM.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.159
OH, GOD.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.929
I'M-- I'M FINE.

32:10.962 --> 32:12.530
I'M FINE. I JUST--

32:12.564 --> 32:14.566
I JUST NEED
A MINUTE TO...

32:19.305 --> 32:21.272
COME ON, APE.

32:21.307 --> 32:22.641
LET'S GET SOME TEA.

32:34.987 --> 32:38.957
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE GONNA
BE OKAY.

32:38.990 --> 32:39.991
GRANDMA.

32:40.025 --> 32:42.294
NO, I MEAN IT.

32:42.327 --> 32:44.296
I'D BET MY LIFE
SAVINGS ON IT.

32:44.329 --> 32:47.231
WELL, I REALIZE THAT'S
AN EMPTY PROMISE

32:47.266 --> 32:50.068
GIVEN THAT I HAVE
A SLIGHT GAMBLING PROBLEM.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.569
( chuckles )

32:51.603 --> 32:54.138
SERIOUSLY.

32:54.173 --> 32:58.644
THERE'S NO DAMN WAY
I'M LETTING YOU DIE
BEFORE I DO.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.454
( cellphone beeps )

33:16.028 --> 33:18.029
( beeps )

33:18.063 --> 33:20.365
( cellphone rings )

33:22.201 --> 33:24.670
THIS IS DR. CARVER.

33:24.702 --> 33:26.038
MM-HMM.

33:28.673 --> 33:31.143
( sighs )

33:31.175 --> 33:33.612
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.085
THIS FAMILY'S BEEN
THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER,

33:40.118 --> 33:41.086
AND WE'RE GOOD
IN A CRISIS.

33:41.119 --> 33:42.488
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.155
OKAY? WE'RE JUST
GONNA FIGURE OUT

33:44.189 --> 33:46.090
THE BEST COURSE
OF TREATMENT FOR YOU

33:46.125 --> 33:47.526
AND WE'RE GONNA
GET RIGHT ON IT.

33:47.558 --> 33:50.028
WELL, WE NEED
THE TEST RESULTS FIRST.

33:50.061 --> 33:51.195
RIGHT, GEORGE?

33:51.230 --> 33:53.030
ACTUALLY,
THIS WAS THE LAB.

33:53.065 --> 33:54.400
WELL?

33:57.669 --> 34:00.705
THE FORM OF LEUKEMIA
YOU HAVE IS CALLED "AML."

34:00.739 --> 34:03.275
ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.

34:03.307 --> 34:05.576
- IS THAT A CURABLE KIND?
- IT'S TREATABLE.

34:05.611 --> 34:08.112
THIS FORM OF LEUKEMIA
GOES INTO REMISSION

34:08.146 --> 34:09.648
ABOUT 75% OF THE TIME.

34:09.681 --> 34:12.117
SO IS THIS GOOD NEWS
OR BAD NEWS?

34:12.150 --> 34:13.751
REMISSION
ISN'T A CURE.

34:13.786 --> 34:14.753
IT'S SERIOUS.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.054
Sara: OKAY.

34:16.088 --> 34:18.157
HOW SOON
CAN SHE START?

34:18.190 --> 34:20.259
WELL, IDEALLY TOMORROW.
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE CALLS--

34:20.291 --> 34:22.226
CAN WE CHECK HER
IN TONIGHT?

34:22.260 --> 34:23.262
WELL, THE PROCEDURE
BEGINS WITH A FULL
WEEK OF CHEMO.

34:23.295 --> 34:24.262
THAT'S IN-PATIENT,
RIGHT?

34:24.295 --> 34:25.297
WAIT.
WAIT, LISTEN TO ME

34:25.329 --> 34:27.132
HOW DEBILITATING
IS THIS GONNA BE?

34:27.166 --> 34:28.400
JUST WAIT!
LISTEN TO ME.

34:28.434 --> 34:31.135
STOP USING WORDS
LIKE "PROCEDURE"

34:31.170 --> 34:32.204
AND "DEBILITATING."

34:32.237 --> 34:34.405
I'M NOT GOING TO
THE HOSPITAL TONIGHT.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.474
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
START TREATMENT?

34:36.507 --> 34:38.277
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I NEED TO
FIGURE THIS OUT.

34:38.309 --> 34:40.278
- I HAVE TO DO IT.
- YOU'RE NOT THINKING CLEARLY.

34:40.311 --> 34:41.413
WAIT A SECOND.
I'M SORRY,

34:41.447 --> 34:42.713
BUT AS YOUR MOTHER
I CAN'T--

34:42.748 --> 34:45.250
I CAN'T BREATHE.
I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

34:45.284 --> 34:48.186
- YOU CANNOT LEAVE--
- I CAN'T DEAL WITH
THIS RIGHT NOW.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.525
( sighs )

35:21.286 --> 35:24.255
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I HAD A RIGHT TO
KNOW AS HER MOTHER.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.592
WELL, I'M SORRY,

35:26.625 --> 35:27.726
BUT MY LOYALTY

35:27.759 --> 35:28.860
IS TO MY PATIENT FIRST.

35:28.893 --> 35:30.461
APRIL IS AN ADULT,

35:30.496 --> 35:31.730
AND HER HEALTHCARE
IS CONFIDENTIAL.

35:31.762 --> 35:33.264
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULD ACCEPT THAT

35:33.297 --> 35:35.467
IF YOU WERE SOME STRANGER,
BUT YOU'RE FAMILY.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.335
YEAH, WELL,
I REALIZE THAT, SARA.

35:37.369 --> 35:40.472
WHICH IS WHY I'VE BEEN
LOOKING OUT FOR APRIL,

35:40.505 --> 35:41.873
TRYING TO MAKE HER
FEEL SAFE.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.641
IT'S ALL I'VE BEEN
ABLE TO THINK ABOUT.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.744
SO DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT
FAMILY LOYALTY, OKAY?

35:45.777 --> 35:48.547
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S HELD A GRUDGE AGAINST ME
FOR YEARS.

35:48.579 --> 35:50.481
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN LET ME
COME TO MY OWN BROTHER'S
FUNERAL.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.217
YOU KNOW WHY
I DID THAT.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.253
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:56.320 --> 35:58.724
I DON'T WANT TO DWELL
ON THE PAST ANYMORE.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.291
I DON'T.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.226
SO RIGHT NOW,
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE

36:02.260 --> 36:03.762
AN OPEN, HONEST
RELATIONSHIP WITH ME,

36:03.795 --> 36:05.230
YOUR DAUGHTER'S DOCTOR,

36:05.264 --> 36:06.898
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO MOVE ON.

36:06.931 --> 36:08.432
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU ARE HER DOCTOR.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.369
YOU WORK IN
A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.

36:10.402 --> 36:13.304
'CAUSE SHE CHOSE ME.
SHE TRUSTS ME.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.641
WHICH IS A MINOR MIRACLE,
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT

36:16.675 --> 36:19.311
THAT THE LAST TWO YEARS
YOU LET HER THINK THAT
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN

36:19.344 --> 36:20.411
ABOUT ANY OF YOU.

36:31.690 --> 36:32.891
APRIL.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.793
HEY.

36:35.827 --> 36:36.961
YOU TALK TO YOUR UNCLE?

36:40.699 --> 36:41.833
YEP.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.771
SHE'S YOUR SISTER?

36:48.373 --> 36:49.708
I'M SORRY.

36:52.244 --> 36:55.347
YOU KNOW,
I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE

36:55.380 --> 36:57.815
THINKING I KNEW MY DAD.

36:57.849 --> 37:01.353
HE WAS THIS GREAT GUY

37:01.385 --> 37:04.889
WHO TOLD STUPID JOKES,

37:04.922 --> 37:06.992
AND BURNT
SCRAMBLED EGGS...

37:08.559 --> 37:10.862
AND WROTE REALLY
GREAT BOOKS.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.402
AND HAD TWO DAUGHTERS.

37:18.869 --> 37:20.938
NOT THREE.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.507
- ( crying )
- COME HERE.

37:40.891 --> 37:42.527
HEY.

37:42.561 --> 37:45.731
SORRY TO MAKE YOU
WALK SO FAR.

37:45.764 --> 37:49.333
I FORGOT HOW FAR AWAY
THIS WAS FROM THE PARKING LOT.

37:49.367 --> 37:50.969
NO PROBLEM.

37:57.909 --> 38:00.711
I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED
TO HEAR FROM YOU.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.748
I HOPE IT'S OKAY.

38:03.914 --> 38:05.884
THERE'S JUST A LOT OF
STUFF GOING DOWN

38:05.916 --> 38:07.686
IN MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW,

38:07.719 --> 38:09.788
AND I HAD TO GET AWAY.

38:09.820 --> 38:13.492
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT IT IF
YOU DON'T WANT TO.

38:13.525 --> 38:16.494
I JUST WANTED TO
BE AROUND SOMEONE

38:16.527 --> 38:19.530
WHO WOULD MAKE ME...

38:23.802 --> 38:24.802
I DON'T KNOW.

38:26.338 --> 38:27.338
FEEL BETTER.

38:29.574 --> 38:32.510
BRENNA, WHAT HAPPENED?

38:36.815 --> 38:40.585
MY SISTER'S REALLY SICK.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.813
I SAVED THE LAST
NOUGAT FOR YOU.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.481
I CAN'T EAT RIGHT NOW.

39:10.514 --> 39:11.682
I'M SORRY, MOM.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.818
I FELT ALL ALONE BACK THERE.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.688
EVERYONE SEEMS FINE
WITH HER DENIAL.

39:16.722 --> 39:19.824
I'M NOT FINE WITH THAT.
NONE OF US ARE.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.427
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT
PUSHING HER TOO HARD

39:22.460 --> 39:24.829
IS THE RIGHT THING
TO DO EITHER.

39:24.862 --> 39:28.699
HONEY, SHE'S SCARED
OUT OF HER MIND RIGHT NOW.

39:28.733 --> 39:30.501
WELL...

39:30.534 --> 39:32.369
( sighs )

39:32.403 --> 39:34.606
SO AM I.

39:34.639 --> 39:37.108
I KNOW.

39:37.141 --> 39:38.543
MOM, WHAT IF...

39:41.579 --> 39:43.815
WE WON'T LOSE HER.

39:43.849 --> 39:44.815
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

39:44.849 --> 39:46.485
I DON'T.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.954
BUT WE HAVE TO
BELIEVE THAT.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.789
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

39:56.527 --> 39:57.862
ARE YOU DOING OKAY?

40:00.998 --> 40:02.000
YEAH.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.541
I HAD A DREAM
THIS MORNING.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.980
APE, YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

40:15.012 --> 40:18.016
JUST REMEMBER
WHAT I ALWAYS SAY.

40:19.016 --> 40:21.052
WHAT?

40:21.085 --> 40:23.188
LIFE IS ALWAYS GONNA
THROW YOU CURVEBALLS.

40:23.420 --> 40:24.989
YOU CAN'T CONTROL THAT.

40:25.023 --> 40:29.094
ALL YOU CAN DO
IS KEEP SWINGING.

40:30.628 --> 40:32.130
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

40:32.164 --> 40:33.998
SERIOUSLY, DAD?
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME

40:34.032 --> 40:35.934
LIFE THREW YOU
ANY CURVEBALLS?

40:35.967 --> 40:37.969
TRUST ME.
I'VE HAD PLENTY.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.641
AND I KNOW I HAVEN'T ALWAYS
HANDLED THEM IN THE RIGHT WAY,

40:45.043 --> 40:47.211
BUT I ALWAYS TRY.

40:50.181 --> 40:52.083
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT,
APRIL.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.559
( sighs )
IT'S LIKE HE WAS TRYING

41:01.592 --> 41:03.128
TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.900
( sighs )

41:08.934 --> 41:10.202
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S POSSIBLE?

41:14.606 --> 41:15.606
DOM?
