WEBVTT

00:03.274 --> 00:05.542
It should feel totally new.

00:05.567 --> 00:07.960
Fresh. It should scream out.

00:07.985 --> 00:11.330
"This is 2017 and right
here is where it's at."

00:11.417 --> 00:13.317
No more lifestyle TV for you.

00:13.342 --> 00:16.257
Hey, what's the point of redesigning
the agency if we're not gonna make

00:16.282 --> 00:19.116
- bold and exciting changes?
- Well, first of all,

00:19.141 --> 00:22.164
I don't want to redesign the agency.
Second of all, your idea

00:22.189 --> 00:25.796
of bold, exciting changes looks like
something out of my grandma's kitchen.

00:25.821 --> 00:28.156
Hey, it's called midcentury modern,

00:28.181 --> 00:29.915
and it's exactly the kind of statement

00:29.940 --> 00:31.843
we need to make if we're
gonna land the big fish.

00:31.867 --> 00:34.475
Ha! OK, easy there, Captain Highliner.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.601
I say we keep it simple.
New coat of paint, same colour.

00:37.626 --> 00:39.305
New upholstery. Same furniture.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.647
Are you honestly pitching
"keep it the same"

00:41.672 --> 00:43.813
- as a new vision?
- If it ain't broke...

00:43.838 --> 00:46.545
Who redesigns a space to make
it look like it already does?

00:46.570 --> 00:48.686
Who changes something just
for the sake of change?

00:48.711 --> 00:50.789
Time out. Both of you.

00:50.814 --> 00:53.781
There's a person here with
a very aggressive undertow,

00:53.806 --> 00:55.532
claiming that she used
to be married to you...

00:55.556 --> 00:56.611
Finally!

00:56.843 --> 00:58.163
Becca?

00:58.188 --> 00:59.560
What are you doing here?

01:00.660 --> 01:02.343
You're welcome.

01:02.368 --> 01:05.524
- For what?
- I got you two a job.

01:10.352 --> 01:12.353
Clothes? You want us

01:12.378 --> 01:14.616
to drive clothes across town?

01:14.641 --> 01:16.663
Not just clothes.

01:16.688 --> 01:20.225
- Sonia Valero originals.
- We're Pls.

01:20.250 --> 01:23.031
- Not FedEx.
- There's Sonia

01:23.047 --> 01:25.866
and her brother Pietro.
Sonia is the "it" girl

01:25.891 --> 01:28.555
in fashion right now. In two days,

01:28.580 --> 01:31.081
her first solo collection
is going to be showcased

01:31.106 --> 01:32.219
at the closing night

01:32.244 --> 01:34.017
of Toronto Women's Fashion Week.

01:34.042 --> 01:36.491
Anyone who decides anything
is going to be there.

01:36.516 --> 01:38.952
<i>I'm covering it live on
Breakfast with Becca.</i>

01:38.977 --> 01:40.602
I don't know, Becca,

01:40.627 --> 01:42.579
it's not exactly what we do.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.122
Those clothes are going
to launch House of Valero

01:45.147 --> 01:47.295
as a major international brand.

01:47.792 --> 01:50.834
I know hiring security
may seem like overkill

01:50.859 --> 01:54.381
to "fashion pedestrians" like
yourselves, but trust me,

01:54.407 --> 01:57.701
the industry is literally
dying to see these clothes.

01:57.874 --> 02:00.685
You guys need to get them
from here to the venue

02:00.710 --> 02:02.225
- without being seen.
- Becca!

02:02.250 --> 02:04.180
Sonia, I can take the clothes myself...

02:04.205 --> 02:05.470
No, I need you here.

02:05.495 --> 02:09.130
We're so behind. Thank
you for doing this.

02:09.155 --> 02:11.671
This collection is
deeply personal to me.

02:11.696 --> 02:13.616
It's unlike anything I've ever done,

02:13.641 --> 02:16.966
and yet it's like my soul
is sewn into every fabric.

02:16.991 --> 02:19.054
Even the polycotton blends?

02:19.079 --> 02:22.313
They're my life.
Please guard them with yours.

02:22.338 --> 02:24.093
Happy to help.

02:26.538 --> 02:30.307
- Shade?
- Yes. Right. Happy. Happy now.

02:30.348 --> 02:32.010
You seem very in command

02:32.035 --> 02:34.471
of yourself. Have you ever modelled?

02:34.496 --> 02:37.815
Actually, I did a long underwear
campaign in Japan once.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.873
I was talking to her.

02:42.104 --> 02:44.104
- We should go.
- Yeah.

02:44.943 --> 02:46.830
Alright, let's get the racks!

02:47.566 --> 02:49.566
Careful.

02:52.041 --> 02:55.158
- It's easy money.
- I'm happy for the paycheck.

02:55.184 --> 02:58.218
I just don't get the "world".
If I can't throw it in the dryer,

02:58.243 --> 03:00.307
- I'm not buying it.
- What's not to get?

03:00.332 --> 03:02.082
We all put on a
thirtysecond fashion show

03:02.107 --> 03:04.048
every morning when we
decide what to wear.

03:04.073 --> 03:05.668
Thirty seconds at home is one thing,

03:05.693 --> 03:08.206
but a 24/7 obsession,
that's something else entirely.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.455
Well, I for one respect
the way designers

03:10.480 --> 03:12.120
take exciting risks

03:12.145 --> 03:14.286
to try to create
something fresh and new.

03:14.311 --> 03:15.370
Taking risks

03:15.395 --> 03:17.846
is all well and good,
but I prefer designers

03:17.871 --> 03:20.215
who define the word
"classic" by creating things

03:20.240 --> 03:21.832
that stand the test of time.

03:21.857 --> 03:24.464
Whoa!

03:24.488 --> 03:26.540
Open it!

03:27.406 --> 03:32.171
- Open it!
- OK, take it easy, take it easy...

03:34.000 --> 03:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:42.690 --> 03:45.300
They know there's just clothes in there,
right?

03:45.325 --> 03:46.972
So much for easy money.

04:28.348 --> 04:31.183
OK, which of you two
called the fashion police?

04:31.208 --> 04:32.192
Hilarious.

04:32.217 --> 04:34.526
OK, so, have any kind
of look at these guys?

04:34.551 --> 04:37.616
They were wearing masks.
Not to mention the gun in my face.

04:37.641 --> 04:40.042
Happened fast, but I think one
of them may have been a woman.

04:40.067 --> 04:42.222
- Plates? Make? Model?
- There was a sticker

04:42.247 --> 04:44.314
on the back window.
It looked like a unicorn.

04:44.339 --> 04:46.706
Right. It was dancing on a rainbow.

04:46.731 --> 04:48.731
Unicorn dancing on a rainbow.

04:48.930 --> 04:50.792
Right. Did you perchance

04:50.817 --> 04:52.818
hit your heads on the pavement
when you fell out of the van?

04:52.842 --> 04:55.142
Maybe the vehicle was
stolen from a family.

04:55.416 --> 04:58.409
Well, I'll check the database,
start canvassing for witnesses.

04:58.434 --> 05:00.433
Well, you're all over
this laundry heist.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.870
Like a dirty shirt.
Nobody pulls a gun on my friend.

05:02.895 --> 05:04.761
Friend? Singular?

05:04.786 --> 05:06.987
Speaking of laundry, you might
wanna tell the owner of the clothes.

05:07.011 --> 05:09.222
Yeah, we'll break it to her gently.

05:09.550 --> 05:10.769
How could you let this happen?

05:10.794 --> 05:13.103
The SUV came out of nowhere.
We had no chance

05:13.128 --> 05:14.855
- to avoid it.
- You need to find

05:14.880 --> 05:16.761
that van. That collection

05:16.786 --> 05:19.878
is our livelihood.
Without it, House of Valero shuts down.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.524
- Can't you just postpone the show?
- To when?

05:22.549 --> 05:24.855
We were lucky to get
a closing night slot.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.347
If Sonia bows out now,

05:26.372 --> 05:29.269
everyone will say she choked.
Her career will be over.

05:29.348 --> 05:31.448
Do you have time to
recreate the designs?

05:31.473 --> 05:33.870
Some of those pieces
took weeks to build.

05:33.895 --> 05:36.086
The fabric comes from six
different countries alone.

05:36.111 --> 05:38.721
Hey, don't panic.
Just give us a little time.

05:38.746 --> 05:41.679
We don't have time.
The show is in less than 48 hours.

05:41.704 --> 05:42.767
48 hours...

05:42.792 --> 05:46.906
We'll find the clothes, OK?
Just stay the course,

05:46.931 --> 05:49.398
pretend it's business as usual.

05:52.277 --> 05:54.698
Thanks for your help.

05:54.746 --> 05:56.285
That was Maz. None of the vehicles

05:56.310 --> 05:58.285
in the stolencar
database match our SUV.

05:58.310 --> 05:59.949
And I called all the nearby businesses.

05:59.974 --> 06:02.356
No surveillance cameras.
Those guys knew what they were doing.

06:02.380 --> 06:04.456
I keep thinking about
that unicorn sticker.

06:04.482 --> 06:06.849
It was pretty distinctive.
Like an art piece.

06:06.874 --> 06:09.632
- You think it's traceable?
- I got something!

06:10.134 --> 06:12.000
Take a look at this.

06:12.167 --> 06:14.121
I found an underground fashion blog

06:14.146 --> 06:16.847
called "Stitch Warrior".
There's a photo here they're claiming

06:16.872 --> 06:19.574
- is part of Sonia's new collection.
- I remember that dress.

06:19.599 --> 06:21.599
- When was this posted?
- An hour ago.

06:21.624 --> 06:24.175
We need to find out who Stitch
Warrior is, get an address.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.494
Kylie Larue.
She's an online Anna Wintour type

06:26.519 --> 06:28.238
with a rep for having
the dish in fashion

06:28.263 --> 06:30.386
before anyone else.
Sending you the deets.

06:30.411 --> 06:32.411
I'll get my coat.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.197
Hey, Angie respects
your opinion, right?

06:37.222 --> 06:38.808
I think so...?

06:38.862 --> 06:41.331
Alright, this redesign of the office...

06:41.356 --> 06:43.408
I may need your help
getting Angie onside.

06:43.433 --> 06:46.878
Complacency is like a band aid;
You need to rip it off

06:46.903 --> 06:49.626
so the healing can
begin. Are you with me?

06:49.651 --> 06:50.925
I would hope

06:50.950 --> 06:53.558
the answer to that question
goes without saying.

06:53.583 --> 06:57.167
Let's go. Anytime, Shade.

07:02.699 --> 07:05.207
I believe that in order to comment

07:05.232 --> 07:07.027
honestly on fashion, you need to reject

07:07.052 --> 07:08.901
anything resembling rules.

07:09.019 --> 07:11.682
Astute critique can
only come from chaos.

07:11.707 --> 07:14.309
Mission accomplished on that.

07:17.778 --> 07:19.398
You said you had some questions?

07:19.423 --> 07:21.159
The photo you have on your blog

07:21.184 --> 07:23.400
of the Sonia Valero dress.
Where did you get it?

07:23.425 --> 07:25.378
I can't reveal my sources.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.403
That goes against the blogger code.

07:27.428 --> 07:29.838
Sonia's entire collection
was stolen this morning.

07:29.863 --> 07:31.761
That photo makes you the prime suspect.

07:31.786 --> 07:34.581
Maybe you'd like to try the
"blogger code" line on the cops.

07:35.968 --> 07:38.792
I can see this is an important issue.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.462
I suppose I can make an
exception just this once.

07:42.565 --> 07:44.425
I got it from an intern at Vista.

07:44.450 --> 07:46.339
- Vista?
- The fastfashion house?

07:46.364 --> 07:47.675
Whenever hot new clothes

07:47.700 --> 07:50.734
hit the runway, companies like Vista
put out cheap copies within days.

07:50.786 --> 07:52.224
It's just accepted practice.

07:52.249 --> 07:53.926
If you create something good,
places like Vista

07:53.950 --> 07:54.880
will copy it.

07:54.905 --> 07:56.318
Maybe they were trying to get the jump

07:56.342 --> 07:58.379
on copying Sonia's debut collection.

07:58.404 --> 08:00.647
You didn't hear that from me.

08:05.082 --> 08:07.571
I don't care if it's monsoon season.

08:08.123 --> 08:11.333
I want that fabric on my factory
floor by Monday or you'll be back

08:11.358 --> 08:13.762
to pulling fat Americans
around in a rickshaw.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.246
Kevin Avery,

08:16.294 --> 08:17.914
Production Supervisor.
What's this about?

08:17.939 --> 08:20.707
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about Sonia Valero.

08:20.732 --> 08:22.622
Brilliant designer. Love her stuff.

08:22.647 --> 08:23.889
That's quite the understatement,

08:23.913 --> 08:25.005
wouldn't you say?

08:25.030 --> 08:27.356
- Excuse me?
- Care to explain this?

08:27.935 --> 08:28.974
Where did you get that?

08:28.999 --> 08:30.403
That's not important. What's important

08:30.427 --> 08:32.264
is that we can trace it
back to one of your interns.

08:32.288 --> 08:34.683
And even more important,
it's from Sonia's latest collection,

08:34.707 --> 08:36.767
which was stolen earlier today.

08:36.792 --> 08:39.226
The entire collection?

08:39.366 --> 08:43.739
Joel, I need you to halt production
on the red dress with the black lace.

08:43.764 --> 08:46.902
Yes, I'm serious.

08:47.067 --> 08:50.465
Did... did you just admit to
stealing Sonia's collection?

08:50.498 --> 08:52.450
- No.
- But you stopped production.

08:52.475 --> 08:54.927
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I stole it.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.372
OK, forgive me if I'm not convinced.

08:57.841 --> 09:00.443
Since you're clearly new to this,
let me explain it to you.

09:00.467 --> 09:03.488
Vista makes knockoffs of
popular designs. In order

09:03.513 --> 09:06.652
to become popular, they need to be
seen in a highprofile fashion show,

09:06.677 --> 09:08.934
otherwise there isn't any demand.

09:09.084 --> 09:11.457
You following the bouncing ball?

09:11.482 --> 09:14.347
If you didn't steal the clothes,
how did your intern get that photo?

09:14.597 --> 09:16.612
You know what? We're done here.

09:16.637 --> 09:17.425
OK.

09:17.450 --> 09:19.349
I'll just call my buddy
down at the labour union,

09:19.373 --> 09:20.451
tell him how cooperative you've been.

09:20.475 --> 09:23.763
Maybe he'll stop by and check
out the conditions around here.

09:24.133 --> 09:26.614
This is not an admission of guilt.

09:26.811 --> 09:29.440
It's not illegal to receive a photo.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.408
This is the original version.

09:34.772 --> 09:36.013
Wait, is that

09:36.038 --> 09:38.466
- one of Sonia's models?
- Yeah.

09:38.491 --> 09:40.539
It is.

09:40.564 --> 09:42.755
- Estella?
- It looks like a selfie

09:42.780 --> 09:44.199
taken in one of your change rooms.

09:44.224 --> 09:45.497
That makes no sense.

09:45.522 --> 09:48.517
Why would she betray me after I
made her the jewel of my show?

09:48.542 --> 09:51.383
I can't process this right now.

09:53.216 --> 09:56.175
Do you think Estella is capable
of setting up a heist like this?

09:56.200 --> 09:58.669
Why? What would she
want with my collection?

09:58.693 --> 10:00.046
Where can we find her now?

10:00.071 --> 10:02.355
She's staying at the
Kerwin Arms, Room 118.

10:02.381 --> 10:04.107
Thanks.

10:04.655 --> 10:07.773
All this trouble over
some coloured thread.

10:07.798 --> 10:09.614
You still don't get it, do you?

10:09.639 --> 10:13.251
Fashion isn't about clothes.
It's about the moment.

10:13.276 --> 10:16.512
I had to make thousands of public
appearances during my hockey career,

10:16.537 --> 10:18.670
and sometimes I wasn't feeling it.

10:18.695 --> 10:21.872
But you throw on your best suit,
or leather catsuit,

10:21.897 --> 10:25.417
if that's your thing,
and suddenly you're "on".

10:25.442 --> 10:27.086
And it's that moment

10:27.111 --> 10:30.000
when you step out into
the world and say:

10:30.025 --> 10:33.026
This is the best of me.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.325
- Clothes make the man, is that it?
- Tragedy is,

10:39.350 --> 10:41.177
most people never get to
experience that moment

10:41.201 --> 10:43.896
because they're too afraid to go for it.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.356
Excuse us!

10:54.012 --> 10:55.906
Shade.

11:00.612 --> 11:02.829
Estella?

11:09.734 --> 11:11.546
Wild guess?

11:11.571 --> 11:14.258
She doesn't have the clothes.

11:22.162 --> 11:23.818
Tell us what happened.

11:23.843 --> 11:27.332
Two big fat guys broke into my room
and started asking me about a van.

11:27.357 --> 11:29.552
- The stolen van?
- How do I know?

11:29.577 --> 11:32.880
They were asking me where it was,
who stole it, did I hire them...

11:32.905 --> 11:33.749
And what did you tell them?

11:33.774 --> 11:35.041
I didn't know what they
were talking about.

11:35.065 --> 11:36.592
I didn't steal any van.

11:36.617 --> 11:39.357
- Then what happened?
- Then they put me in the closet.

11:39.382 --> 11:43.427
- You poor, poor girl.
- Client. Picture. Stolen dress.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.263
Right.

11:45.288 --> 11:48.586
Why did you send a picture of
Sonia's new piece to Vista?

11:48.798 --> 11:50.622
How do I put this?

11:50.888 --> 11:52.624
For money.

11:52.825 --> 11:56.380
I'm going to be 22 soon.
Retirement is right around the corner.

11:56.488 --> 11:59.215
If I don't think about
my future, who will?

12:00.116 --> 12:01.546
So, what do you think?

12:01.571 --> 12:03.149
I don't buy that she set up the robbery.

12:03.173 --> 12:04.990
She was just about to
star in Sonia's show.

12:05.015 --> 12:07.138
How does it help her
"retirement" to cancel it?

12:07.163 --> 12:08.841
Not to mention, that selfie was taken

12:08.866 --> 12:11.279
in Sonia's dressing room
before the van went missing.

12:11.304 --> 12:12.967
What about those two
guys leaving her room?

12:12.991 --> 12:14.758
Obviously we're not the only
ones looking for the van.

12:14.782 --> 12:15.677
How many people

12:15.702 --> 12:16.929
want to steal these clothes?

12:16.954 --> 12:18.811
I'm starting to wonder if
it's about the clothes at all.

12:18.835 --> 12:20.935
- What do you mean?
- You heard what Pietro said,

12:20.960 --> 12:23.588
if the show doesn't go forward,
it'll destroy Sonia's career.

12:23.613 --> 12:24.966
So you think someone's out to get her?

12:24.990 --> 12:26.207
Yeah. Estella betrayed her.

12:26.232 --> 12:29.279
Maybe we need to take a
look at her inner circle.

12:29.689 --> 12:32.423
I'll have Zoe bring up a
list of Sonia's employees.

12:32.448 --> 12:34.716
Maybe someone has a grudge
we don't know about.

12:41.955 --> 12:45.591
Hey, Matt.

12:45.616 --> 12:48.471
Past your curfew. Grounded.

12:48.496 --> 12:49.566
I was at the diner.

12:49.591 --> 12:52.120
Shona asked me to help insulate
the windows for winter.

12:52.145 --> 12:54.362
- Shona?
- Don't get cute.

12:54.479 --> 12:57.042
It's a bit late for arts and crafts,
don't you think?

12:57.067 --> 13:00.376
I'm trying to get Angie on board
with my vision for the redesign.

13:00.401 --> 13:02.425
Hey, is this too rough?

13:03.081 --> 13:06.259
- You making underwear out of it?
- You're no help. Where's Jules?

13:06.284 --> 13:09.329
- I don't know, I just got here.
- I assumed she was with you.

13:09.354 --> 13:12.128
- I thought she was with you.
- What time is it?

13:18.939 --> 13:20.707
Easy.

13:20.732 --> 13:24.182
- Thank you for walking me home.
- Not a problem.

13:25.081 --> 13:26.980
Goodnight, Mr. Shade.

13:27.167 --> 13:29.300
- Mr. Shade.
- See ya.

13:29.325 --> 13:32.460
- See ya.
- Hi!

13:32.485 --> 13:33.816
Sorry, um,

13:33.841 --> 13:36.409
I was at Liam's and
I lost track of time.

13:36.434 --> 13:40.175
Are Liam's parents cool with
you being over there this late?

13:40.200 --> 13:43.835
If they're not, they're too polite to
say anything. Either way I'm golden.

13:43.860 --> 13:46.503
Alright, how about you
just call me next time, OK?

13:46.528 --> 13:48.042
Yeah, sure.

13:48.067 --> 13:52.050
- OK. Tired. Bed. 'Night.
- 'Night, sweetie.

13:54.349 --> 13:55.647
See?

13:55.672 --> 13:57.639
No yelling, no drama.

13:57.668 --> 13:59.537
I got this parenting thing.

13:59.562 --> 14:01.287
Yeah.

14:01.312 --> 14:03.428
You got this, son.

14:06.757 --> 14:08.810
This is everyone that's
worked at House of Valero

14:08.835 --> 14:09.686
in the past year.

14:09.711 --> 14:11.170
- And?
- No one says a bad word

14:11.195 --> 14:12.764
about Sonia. In fact, they all say

14:12.789 --> 14:15.037
- she's too nice.
- OK.

14:15.966 --> 14:17.756
I went on a bunch of vendor sites

14:17.781 --> 14:20.014
and printed off every
sticker with a unicorn on it.

14:20.039 --> 14:21.928
- Anything look familiar?
- That's it.

14:21.953 --> 14:24.967
- Unicorn dancing on a rainbow.
- I knew I wasn't crazy.

14:24.992 --> 14:26.771
Vendor's based out of Vancouver.

14:26.796 --> 14:29.021
I'll give her a call and
see if I can find a list

14:29.046 --> 14:31.418
- of anyone who bought it here.
- Shadow?!

14:31.443 --> 14:34.012
Boy.

14:34.037 --> 14:36.913
Thank god you guys are OK.

14:37.195 --> 14:40.670
Now, how could you let this happen?
I mean, what kind

14:40.695 --> 14:43.693
of security detail can't taxi
something from point A to point B?

14:43.718 --> 14:46.947
Becca, calm down.
We're looking for the clothes.

14:46.972 --> 14:50.348
Shadow, you don't understand.
My job is on the line for this.

14:50.373 --> 14:53.871
I had to convince my bosses
to let me do an entire episode

14:53.896 --> 14:56.925
on Sonia's debut.
The promos are airing right now!

14:56.950 --> 14:58.355
Well, help us, then.

14:58.380 --> 15:01.011
Can you think of anyone that might
have a vendetta against Sonia?

15:01.036 --> 15:03.386
We think someone may be
sabotaging her career.

15:03.411 --> 15:07.082
What about Stephan Caras?

15:07.107 --> 15:09.013
Why would he be mixed up in this?

15:09.038 --> 15:10.433
Who's Stephan Caras?

15:10.458 --> 15:14.363
Legendary designer. Sonia was
head of his creative for years.

15:14.388 --> 15:16.253
And when she left to go solo,

15:16.278 --> 15:18.005
House of Caras stumbled.

15:18.030 --> 15:20.280
I don't think Steph would
do something like this.

15:20.305 --> 15:22.523
- Steph?
- Yeah, we go way back.

15:22.917 --> 15:26.351
- Wait, you know Stephan Caras?
- Know him?

15:26.455 --> 15:28.734
He carried me home
after an absinthe bender

15:28.759 --> 15:32.873
- after the 2004 Fashion Awards.
- Then what are we waiting for?

15:32.898 --> 15:35.445
- Let's go, you drive.
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey.

15:35.470 --> 15:37.737
There's no "we" here.
We don't do this together.

15:37.762 --> 15:40.091
No, Shadow, I am going with you.

15:40.116 --> 15:42.789
This is my career on the line.

15:42.814 --> 15:46.945
Sonia's career. Is what I meant to say.

15:48.099 --> 15:50.634
Don't look at me.

15:50.659 --> 15:54.289
I'm gonna go,
dig deeper into Sonia's financials.

15:58.945 --> 16:00.374
Yes, ma'am.

16:00.399 --> 16:02.664
It is going to be an amazing episode.

16:02.689 --> 16:05.733
Gamechanger doesn't even cover it.
It's going to be

16:05.758 --> 16:09.226
a worldchanger.
It's going to be a universechanger...

16:09.251 --> 16:12.289
OK then. Byebye.

16:13.588 --> 16:17.703
- God, I am so fired.
- We'll find the clothes, Becca.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.664
I love my new job,

16:19.689 --> 16:22.406
but sometimes I think it's
going to swallow me whole.

16:22.430 --> 16:24.915
A far cry from being the
weather girl on Channel 3?

16:24.940 --> 16:26.164
Meteorologist.

16:26.190 --> 16:29.187
- Right.
- Honestly, Matt, sometimes

16:29.212 --> 16:33.171
I wake up and I can't
remember going to bed.

16:33.196 --> 16:36.197
And I haven't had a sustained
conversation with our daughter

16:36.228 --> 16:38.007
- in days.
- Jules is fine.

16:38.032 --> 16:41.911
You haven't noticed how much time
she's been spending at Liam's lately?

16:41.936 --> 16:44.164
Actually, I have. So what?

16:44.189 --> 16:46.882
So, it doesn't bother you?

16:46.907 --> 16:48.828
No.

16:51.187 --> 16:54.901
No! Come on, it's Jules
we're talking about.

16:54.926 --> 16:55.957
She's 14!

16:55.982 --> 16:57.652
And how old were you when you started

16:57.677 --> 16:59.561
fooling around?

16:59.840 --> 17:03.074
I'm gonna kill him.
I'm gonna stuff him in a foot locker,

17:03.099 --> 17:05.044
rent a boat, drive 15 miles offshore...

17:05.069 --> 17:06.473
OK, calm down.

17:06.530 --> 17:09.164
The worst thing that we
can do is to demonize it.

17:09.189 --> 17:11.189
You should talk to her.

17:11.214 --> 17:13.647
- Me?
- Well, she's your daughter too!

17:13.673 --> 17:17.912
And did you not just hear everything
I said about how busy I am?

17:22.503 --> 17:25.163
Here's a list of people who
bought the sticker in Toronto.

17:25.188 --> 17:26.497
I'm gonna start calling
to see if any of them

17:26.521 --> 17:29.901
drive a grey SUV. What's wrong?

17:29.926 --> 17:31.964
I just spoke with a
few of Sonia's vendors.

17:31.989 --> 17:34.713
House of Valero is racking
up some massive bills.

17:34.738 --> 17:36.464
Well, it's not uncommon for a startup.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.370
And Sonia's famous for
using the finest materials.

17:39.395 --> 17:41.456
That's bound to come back and bite you.

17:41.481 --> 17:44.525
Not always.
During Sonia's heyday at House of Caras

17:44.550 --> 17:47.182
the price of his clothing went way up,
but so did his profile.

17:47.207 --> 17:48.980
Except Sonia doesn't have any sales yet,

17:49.005 --> 17:50.721
so where's the money coming from?

17:50.746 --> 17:54.391
- Maybe an investor?
- Zoe, wait.

17:54.416 --> 17:56.089
I need your help.

17:56.707 --> 17:59.668
You and I have to join
forces to steer Shade away

17:59.693 --> 18:01.308
from what he's proposing
for the redesign.

18:01.324 --> 18:03.215
I'm trying to be objective,

18:03.240 --> 18:05.572
but it's like he wants to pull
the pin on a crazygrenade

18:05.597 --> 18:08.175
and just toss it into the
middle of the room. Am I right?

18:08.315 --> 18:10.448
I would hope the answer to that question

18:10.490 --> 18:12.800
goes without saying.

18:22.319 --> 18:24.640
These sales numbers are terrible.

18:24.665 --> 18:29.067
- You can do better, Lisbeth.
- I will, Stephan. I promise.

18:30.514 --> 18:33.182
Shadow. How are you?

18:33.207 --> 18:34.247
Good to see you again, Steph.

18:34.271 --> 18:36.052
What's this I hear about you becoming

18:36.077 --> 18:38.052
- a private investigator?
- Right place,

18:38.077 --> 18:40.090
right time. Steph, I don't
think you ever met my exwife,

18:40.114 --> 18:42.125
Becca. Becca, Stephan Caras.

18:42.150 --> 18:45.601
- Channel 3 weather girl, right?
- Meteorologist.

18:45.626 --> 18:47.559
But I have my own show now.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.101
It's so great to meet you.

18:49.126 --> 18:52.624
- I am SUCH a fan of your work.
- Naturally.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.958
Wow. It's one of mine, isn't it?

18:56.983 --> 18:58.648
From two seasons ago.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.371
Sonia's work. Gorgeous.

19:00.396 --> 19:03.741
Stunning. Actually,
that's why we're here.

19:03.766 --> 19:06.109
Someone stole her entire
collection yesterday.

19:06.134 --> 19:06.962
What?

19:06.987 --> 19:08.923
So we're talking to
anybody who knows her.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.888
And who knows her better than you?
She was your star pupil.

19:11.913 --> 19:14.850
Who's about to become your
stiffest competition. Stephan,

19:14.875 --> 19:17.594
- we have to ask.
- I would never do that to Sonia.

19:17.619 --> 19:21.287
Sonia is a star.
I would never do anything to harm her.

19:26.780 --> 19:30.383
- Why did you go after him like that?
- Isn't that why we came?

19:30.408 --> 19:32.954
You're the one who told me
he's the most likely suspect.

19:32.979 --> 19:36.608
- That was before I met him.
- A little flattery goes a long way?

19:41.420 --> 19:45.202
Is Stephan Caras doing a
seriouslyplussized collection for men?

19:45.232 --> 19:47.874
Yeah, we've met before.
In the hotel hallway.

19:47.899 --> 19:49.306
Boss wants to have a
little chat with you.

19:49.330 --> 19:50.185
Yeah?

19:50.210 --> 19:52.150
What happens if we decline?

19:52.577 --> 19:54.655
What happens if they decline?

19:54.733 --> 19:57.697
It'd be a lot better if they didn't.

20:05.635 --> 20:07.401
You know I'm going to
lose my job, right?

20:07.426 --> 20:10.710
Is that really your
primary concern right now?

20:13.780 --> 20:16.799
Hello. I'm Max Zangrilli.

20:16.968 --> 20:19.484
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Shade, this is...

20:19.509 --> 20:20.803
Where's the van?

20:20.828 --> 20:22.723
- You're asking me?
- Yeah.

20:22.748 --> 20:25.649
You're the one they hired as
'security' to keep it safe,

20:25.674 --> 20:27.840
so either you're totally incompetent

20:27.865 --> 20:29.777
or you're in on the score.

20:29.802 --> 20:31.439
Either way,

20:31.937 --> 20:34.108
I need to know what you know.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.444
We're looking for it, just like you.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.317
How'd a guy like you get
connected with Sonia, anyway?

20:40.342 --> 20:41.824
A guy like me?

20:43.052 --> 20:45.995
What does that mean, "a guy like me"?
What are you saying?

20:46.020 --> 20:49.730
- Never mind.
- He means "mobster".

20:49.755 --> 20:52.489
- Right? You mean mobster, right?
- Shh...

20:52.529 --> 20:56.886
It's the last name, right?
It's the last name. I'm an importer

20:56.911 --> 20:59.847
of highvalue goods. I'm a businessman.

20:59.872 --> 21:02.933
And just like all businessmen,
I will do anything it takes

21:02.958 --> 21:04.670
to remain a businessman.

21:04.695 --> 21:07.253
- Like roughing up a helpless model?
- Hey.

21:07.278 --> 21:11.291
- Sonia told me.
- Look at their necks. Look at their faces.

21:11.403 --> 21:14.786
They went to ask her a few simple
questions, she went berserk.

21:14.811 --> 21:17.746
- She started hitting and scratching...
- And biting.

21:17.954 --> 21:20.523
We were scared for our lives.

21:23.132 --> 21:24.570
How did you guys get to her

21:24.595 --> 21:26.820
- before we did, anyway?
- That's not your concern.

21:26.866 --> 21:28.765
Your main concern right now should be:

21:28.796 --> 21:31.624
Where is that van?

21:31.648 --> 21:34.398
I have no idea. I swear.

21:34.423 --> 21:37.186
Look, we both want the same thing,

21:37.211 --> 21:39.960
so why don't you let us go and
we'll see what we can dig up.

21:39.985 --> 21:43.153
You do the same and we'll get
together later and share information.

21:43.460 --> 21:47.229
OK. OK, but getting that van
is time sensitive.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.058
You have six hours.

21:49.083 --> 21:52.061
And then I will come looking for you.

21:56.842 --> 21:59.652
They could have at
least called us an Uber.

22:02.186 --> 22:04.731
My god. Who were those guys?

22:04.756 --> 22:07.213
The leader's name was Max Zangrilli.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.886
And Becca? Is she OK?

22:08.933 --> 22:11.290
Yeah, she said if her fashion
episode falls through,

22:11.315 --> 22:14.339
she's gonna do a piece on incompetent
investigators who should have

22:14.364 --> 22:16.722
- their licenses revoked.
- So... fine then.

22:17.598 --> 22:19.979
Why would someone like Max
Zangrilli want to find the van

22:20.004 --> 22:22.487
so badly? He's obviously not
interested in the clothes.

22:22.512 --> 22:24.638
Maybe there was something
other than clothing in there.

22:24.662 --> 22:26.563
How would Sonia get mixed
up with someone like that?

22:26.587 --> 22:29.054
Sonia doesn't take care of the
business side. That's Pietro.

22:29.079 --> 22:31.840
Speaking of which,
I looked into their financials.

22:31.865 --> 22:34.137
House of Valero isn't leveraged
like a typical start up,

22:34.162 --> 22:37.308
they've been maxedout on credit for
months. It's not clear how they're paying

22:37.333 --> 22:38.591
for anything.

22:38.616 --> 22:40.887
I think it's time for
a talk with our client.

22:46.462 --> 22:49.228
That was an awfully
red light back there.

22:49.253 --> 22:51.535
- Are you OK?
- It's Jules.

22:51.731 --> 22:54.398
Becca thinks that she
and Liam might be...

22:54.422 --> 22:56.556
I mean, she's 14.

22:56.581 --> 22:58.925
She's not even thinking about that yet.
Right?

22:58.950 --> 23:00.504
You know,

23:00.529 --> 23:02.830
it really looks like it's gonna rain.

23:03.177 --> 23:05.862
Have you seen that new
Ryan Reynolds movie yet?

23:05.887 --> 23:08.347
Is it hot in here or is it just me?

23:08.372 --> 23:10.514
You know something.

23:12.473 --> 23:14.949
All I can say is, you shouldn't worry.

23:15.302 --> 23:17.302
You've got a smart girl there.

23:17.327 --> 23:20.835
What does that mean?
Smart how? Worry why?

23:20.860 --> 23:22.994
Just drive, Shade.

23:25.914 --> 23:28.883
Who's Max Zangrilli?

23:28.908 --> 23:30.801
Let me guess. Money's a little short,

23:30.848 --> 23:33.688
so you decided to reach under the
table to try and find some more?

23:33.713 --> 23:35.713
Pietro?

23:39.623 --> 23:42.855
Did you think all these
people worked for free?

23:42.973 --> 23:44.527
Not to mention the cost

23:44.552 --> 23:47.183
of booking the closing night gala.
And the clothes!

23:47.208 --> 23:50.094
Persian silk, Limerick
lace, Angora wool.

23:50.119 --> 23:52.645
You're worth it, Sonia,
but you're very, very expensive.

23:52.670 --> 23:55.238
- What are you saying?
- Our only shot

23:55.263 --> 23:57.901
was to make this debut show a sensation,

23:57.926 --> 23:59.487
and appeal to the buyers.

23:59.512 --> 24:03.067
I needed to do that,
I needed to make that happen,

24:04.152 --> 24:06.195
so I made a deal with Zangrilli.

24:06.220 --> 24:07.987
What kind of deal?

24:08.125 --> 24:10.309
When we imported the
fabrics from overseas,

24:10.334 --> 24:14.128
we also brought in... other goods.

24:14.129 --> 24:16.963
- Smuggled them in, you mean?
- For a cash infusion.

24:16.988 --> 24:19.785
You told them about Estella.
That's why they got there first.

24:19.810 --> 24:21.691
How could you do this?

24:21.716 --> 24:23.749
Hey, I believe in your
vision with all my heart,

24:23.774 --> 24:26.475
but vision costs money. I had no choice.

24:26.634 --> 24:28.467
What kind of goods are we talking about?

24:28.492 --> 24:31.106
The "don't ask don't tell" kind.

24:31.544 --> 24:33.755
I was supposed to deliver
the van to Zangrilli,

24:33.780 --> 24:35.280
but then Sonia hired you

24:35.305 --> 24:38.319
to deliver the clothes. Sonia, wait...

24:39.170 --> 24:41.271
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

24:41.296 --> 24:43.225
If Zangrilli had something
illegal in there,

24:43.250 --> 24:45.638
we just picked up a whole
new whack of suspects.

24:45.663 --> 24:49.100
Zoe found a match on the vehicle
the robbers used. Grey SUV,

24:49.125 --> 24:52.171
unicorn sticker. She texted the address.

24:58.677 --> 25:00.678
You sure we shouldn't call Mazhari?

25:00.703 --> 25:02.887
You think two masked gunmen live here?

25:03.840 --> 25:05.706
Yeah...

25:05.731 --> 25:07.708
There. That's the SUV.

25:07.733 --> 25:09.633
Can I help you?

25:10.359 --> 25:13.833
- You did say one of them was a woman.
- Is this your vehicle?

25:13.858 --> 25:15.551
- Yes.
- Any chance

25:15.576 --> 25:19.020
you have a violently unquenchable
thirst for high fashion?

25:19.045 --> 25:22.981
We're private investigators. Has your SUV
gone missing in the last couple of days?

25:23.006 --> 25:25.067
- No.
- Never left your sight?

25:25.092 --> 25:26.442
It was at the garage.

25:26.467 --> 25:28.500
- The brakes were being done.
- Which garage?

25:28.525 --> 25:30.826
McLuhan's. On Castlefield.

25:30.851 --> 25:33.573
- Thank you.
- Cool sticker.

25:38.211 --> 25:40.831
It's Zoe again. "Call me ASAP."

25:41.028 --> 25:42.683
First of all,

25:42.708 --> 25:45.831
they both have completely different
tastes and styles. And second of all,

25:45.856 --> 25:48.215
I don't know whose
feelings get hurt more easy

25:48.302 --> 25:50.808
and who's really more
invested in this stuff.

25:50.833 --> 25:54.273
I just started here.

25:54.298 --> 25:57.465
Everett Investigations.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.642
You have a visitor.

26:02.667 --> 26:04.924
Italian guy. Slightly intimidating,

26:04.949 --> 26:07.525
but maybe it's just confidence.

26:08.462 --> 26:10.361
Did you find the van?

26:10.386 --> 26:14.822
Mr. Zangrilli, I presume. We know
about the deal you made with Pietro.

26:14.918 --> 26:17.352
So what?

26:17.377 --> 26:19.844
But you have to promise not
to hurt Sonia or her brother.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.697
You know what?
Right there, that's profiling, alright?

26:22.722 --> 26:24.370
I am a businessman.

26:24.411 --> 26:26.988
I am not... what you think I am, OK?

26:27.013 --> 26:29.046
I just want my merchandise.

26:29.071 --> 26:32.039
Alright, we tracked the SUV
down to a pregnant suburban mom.

26:32.064 --> 26:34.563
She says the car was in a
repair shop during the robbery.

26:34.588 --> 26:36.209
Good. What's the plan?

26:44.854 --> 26:47.889
Well. If it isn't Dork and Mindy.

26:47.914 --> 26:51.507
If you want a woman's opinion, I think
you both looked better with the mask on.

26:52.172 --> 26:54.109
You made a big mistake coming here.

26:54.134 --> 26:55.376
Before you take another step,

26:55.401 --> 26:57.547
it's important that you
have all the facts regarding

26:57.572 --> 27:00.266
- your current situation.
- What the hell are you talking about?

27:00.291 --> 27:03.828
See? I told you not to use big words.

27:03.853 --> 27:05.484
Hi.

27:06.492 --> 27:09.878
So, first of all,

27:10.345 --> 27:13.215
who hired you to steal the van?

27:17.156 --> 27:20.804
We were contacted anonymously and
told to leave the van at a drop site.

27:20.829 --> 27:24.187
And where exactly is that drop site?

27:27.615 --> 27:31.942
- I can't believe it.
- Check the spare tire.

27:39.441 --> 27:43.204
Thank god.
Alright, take it, put it in the car.

27:44.704 --> 27:46.705
OK.

27:46.730 --> 27:48.668
Wait. We can't just
let you leave with...

27:48.693 --> 27:50.526
whatever you have there.

27:50.551 --> 27:53.178
Look at the bright side.
At least you know for sure

27:53.203 --> 27:55.144
that the robbery was about the clothes.

27:55.183 --> 27:56.782
Fashion.

27:56.807 --> 27:58.874
Now that's a nasty business.

28:17.439 --> 28:19.719
Dad, I'm late for school, I'll see ya.

28:19.744 --> 28:22.450
Jules, hang on a sec, will ya?

28:24.258 --> 28:26.559
Hey, honey, um,

28:26.988 --> 28:29.227
I spent yesterday with your mother.

28:29.457 --> 28:32.501
I sense a disturbance in the force.

28:32.526 --> 28:36.134
We were comparing notes about how much
time you've been spending at Liam's.

28:36.263 --> 28:37.839
OK...

28:37.965 --> 28:41.212
You have the right

28:41.237 --> 28:44.321
to a certain amount of privacy,
but we're your parents

28:44.346 --> 28:46.102
and we also have rights.

28:46.690 --> 28:49.090
And at the end of the day, I get it.

28:49.115 --> 28:50.437
New feelings...

28:51.249 --> 28:53.249
burgeon...

28:53.274 --> 28:54.915
Burgeon?

28:54.940 --> 28:58.241
And in this... burgeoning,

28:58.266 --> 29:01.111
things sometimes

29:01.136 --> 29:02.908
become...

29:03.176 --> 29:04.910
muddy...

29:06.023 --> 29:07.788
waters...

29:08.588 --> 29:10.924
- in the stream.
- What are you talking about?

29:10.949 --> 29:13.450
- I have no idea.
- Um...

29:15.621 --> 29:17.464
You're right.

29:17.617 --> 29:20.467
I don't know what's going on
with me, it's like...

29:21.368 --> 29:24.392
it's like I'm on fire

29:24.417 --> 29:27.186
and Liam's the only thing
that can put me out.

29:29.529 --> 29:32.506
Seriously, Dad?

29:32.531 --> 29:34.131
I've just been over there

29:34.156 --> 29:36.865
to eat dinner a lot and watch movies.

29:37.004 --> 29:39.834
- Dinner and movies, that's it?
- Yes, yes, that's it.

29:39.859 --> 29:42.030
'Cause you can tell me,
sweetheart, you know that, right?

29:42.054 --> 29:45.246
Look, the other night,

29:45.271 --> 29:47.506
when I was super late?
It was because we got

29:47.531 --> 29:49.201
into an epic game of Trivial Pursuit,

29:49.226 --> 29:50.506
and once you start a game...

29:50.531 --> 29:52.530
- You finish it.
- You taught me that.

29:52.815 --> 29:55.786
But it was me and Liam
and his whole family,

29:55.811 --> 29:58.202
including his baby sister,
who calls me "Oolz".

29:58.227 --> 30:00.026
- That's pretty cute.
- It is.

30:00.169 --> 30:03.010
So you and Mom can take a breath, OK?

30:03.220 --> 30:06.388
- OK.
- OK. I'm so late. See you later.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.734
Sonia? Where is everybody?

30:19.257 --> 30:21.258
I got greedy with my vision.

30:21.757 --> 30:23.924
That's why this is happening.

30:23.949 --> 30:25.709
I pushed for too much. This is fate

30:25.734 --> 30:26.452
pushing back.

30:26.477 --> 30:28.889
- You didn't cancel your show?
- Not yet,

30:28.914 --> 30:31.497
but in a few hours it
won't make a difference.

30:32.341 --> 30:35.225
- Unless you found the van?
- We did, but your clothes

30:35.250 --> 30:38.651
- were gone.
- Where's Pietro?

30:38.676 --> 30:42.110
He's with Stephan,
finalizing the details of his offer.

30:42.135 --> 30:44.022
- Stephan Caras?
- What offer?

30:44.047 --> 30:45.896
He's agreed to pay our debt.

30:45.921 --> 30:48.692
- Gee, that's awfully nice of him.
- What's the catch?

30:48.717 --> 30:50.366
Stephan wants me to go back with him.

30:50.391 --> 30:52.491
My brother and I always dreamed

30:52.516 --> 30:54.108
of opening our own house.

30:54.133 --> 30:56.855
Now that we've had a
taste of independence...

30:58.454 --> 31:01.735
going to work for somebody else
is gonna be close to torture.

31:05.616 --> 31:08.585
Sonia, don't pull out of your show yet.

31:08.610 --> 31:10.610
Wait until you hear from us.

31:14.109 --> 31:16.583
What if this was
Stephan's idea all along?

31:16.608 --> 31:19.459
Ruin Sonia's show and then
swoop in like the white knight

31:19.484 --> 31:22.251
and save her.
Buy out her future at a cut rate.

31:22.276 --> 31:25.521
I don't see it. He seemed so
sincere when I talked to him.

31:25.546 --> 31:27.928
Don't let your friendship
cloud your judgment.

31:33.264 --> 31:34.827
This is wonderful.

31:34.852 --> 31:37.646
Truly. Unlike anything you've ever done.

31:37.671 --> 31:40.209
- That means everything.
- It looks like the beginning

31:40.234 --> 31:42.819
of a new collection. Congratulations.

31:44.749 --> 31:46.991
- Shadow!
- Hey, Stephan.

31:47.016 --> 31:48.474
Every time you come in here,

31:48.499 --> 31:51.536
- you're always with a beautiful woman.
- This is my partner,

31:51.561 --> 31:53.272
- Angie Everett.
- Please sit.

31:53.297 --> 31:54.803
Thank you.

31:55.326 --> 31:57.654
These are impressive.

31:57.984 --> 32:01.529
Show enough faith to your people
and they might just surprise you.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.053
That was a very generous
offer you made to Sonia

32:04.078 --> 32:06.167
- this morning.
- If I bail her out,

32:06.192 --> 32:08.970
it's with the understanding that
she will come back to work for me.

32:08.995 --> 32:11.305
So it wasn't entirely an act of charity.

32:11.541 --> 32:14.709
Any way you slice it,
Sonia's ruin is your gain.

32:14.734 --> 32:17.045
You don't get it.
Destroying Sonia's show

32:17.070 --> 32:20.466
doesn't make any sense.
Her name will be synonymous

32:20.491 --> 32:23.614
- with failure after this.
- And you don't care about that?

32:23.639 --> 32:26.687
Listen, I believe in
Sonia. I always have.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.015
She has never been
just an employee to me.

32:29.040 --> 32:32.808
- She was always like...
- A daughter. You know what?

32:32.833 --> 32:35.767
Thanks for your time.
Hope we didn't bother you too much.

32:35.792 --> 32:38.159
- Always a pleasure.
- Thank you.

32:38.184 --> 32:40.184
- What are you doing?
- The design sketch

32:40.209 --> 32:42.688
- on the table looked very familiar.
- How familiar?

32:42.713 --> 32:45.156
Like it's from Sonia's
stolen collection.

32:45.181 --> 32:47.615
You think Lisbeth stole her designs?

32:47.640 --> 32:49.781
Wouldn't Stephan be
able to spot her work?

32:49.806 --> 32:50.529
Maybe not.

32:50.554 --> 32:52.421
Sonia said it was like
nothing she'd ever done.

32:52.446 --> 32:53.609
We can't go right at her,

32:53.634 --> 32:55.755
she's gonna deny everything.
Then we won't find the clothes

32:55.779 --> 32:57.594
- in time for the show.
- Alright, so what's the plan?

32:57.618 --> 33:00.202
We're gonna have to do the
lastminute hockey thing.

33:00.234 --> 33:02.835
Pull the winger and put the
defence guy in the penalty box.

33:02.860 --> 33:06.491
That's not a lastminute hockey thing.
I don't even know what that is.

33:06.516 --> 33:10.280
We've got one shot.
Let's make it a good one.

33:15.241 --> 33:17.409
Hi, who am I speaking to?

33:17.906 --> 33:20.492
Lisbeth? My name is Angie Everett,

33:20.517 --> 33:22.784
I was just at your office.

33:22.809 --> 33:25.076
Can you give him a message from me?

33:25.101 --> 33:27.067
It's for his ears only.

33:27.092 --> 33:30.375
Sonia's collection has
been found. I know.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.531
It is wonderful.
Someone obviously had second thoughts,

33:33.556 --> 33:35.249
because they left the entire collection

33:35.274 --> 33:37.695
outside the venue, prÃªtaporter.
Can you just let him know

33:37.720 --> 33:39.558
that Sonia's going
through with the show?

33:39.583 --> 33:41.228
Thank you.

33:41.788 --> 33:44.234
You really think this is gonna work?

33:46.323 --> 33:48.187
You tell me.

34:07.153 --> 34:08.927
OK, calm down.

34:08.952 --> 34:11.117
Is that Sonia?

34:11.141 --> 34:15.011
You told Sonia not to cancel her slot,
but you still don't have the clothes?

34:15.036 --> 34:16.380
We're getting close.

34:19.228 --> 34:22.301
And have I mentioned that my
entire career rides on this?

34:22.326 --> 34:25.260
Once or twice.

34:25.284 --> 34:28.487
If all this comes crashing down,
the only thing I'll have

34:28.513 --> 34:30.833
to fill my days with is
making sure you suffer.

34:30.858 --> 34:33.155
So, status quo?

34:36.014 --> 34:38.389
- What'd she say?
- In half an hour.

34:38.415 --> 34:41.937
Stephan's show will be over, and at that
point it won't matter if Sonia cancels.

34:41.962 --> 34:44.230
Because if we don't have the
clothes by then, then our client

34:44.254 --> 34:46.487
will suffer unprecedented
public humiliation.

34:46.513 --> 34:48.013
Pretty much.

35:11.941 --> 35:14.843
- You take the front, I'll take the back?
- Sure.

35:34.386 --> 35:37.522
Well, that's one way for
inspiration to strike.

35:37.738 --> 35:39.838
You set me up.

35:39.863 --> 35:43.100
The police are on their way.
There's nowhere to run.

35:44.105 --> 35:47.207
- Lisbeth, don't!
- I'll do it. I'll burn them all.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.898
Just talk to me, OK? Help me understand.

35:52.775 --> 35:56.401
Sonia and I started at the
same time with Stephan.

35:56.426 --> 35:58.657
But from day one, it was all about her.

35:58.682 --> 36:00.682
I could barely get him
to look at my stuff,

36:00.707 --> 36:02.327
much less appreciate it.

36:02.352 --> 36:05.785
Everything she did was perfect,
down to the last detail.

36:05.810 --> 36:07.910
OK, take it easy.

36:08.034 --> 36:10.201
I thought it would get
better once she left.

36:10.540 --> 36:11.989
But it got worse.

36:12.013 --> 36:14.464
He resented me even
more for not being her.

36:14.489 --> 36:16.660
You're not thinking clearly.
You don't wanna do this.

36:16.685 --> 36:21.214
If I'm going down, she's going with me!

36:28.457 --> 36:30.605
Think you used enough foam?

36:30.630 --> 36:32.426
Zangrilli was right.

36:32.451 --> 36:34.441
Fashion's a nasty business.

36:34.466 --> 36:37.792
Let's get her clothes out of here.

36:56.746 --> 37:01.219
Welcome to Toronto Women's Fashion Week!

37:02.280 --> 37:05.640
They'll be here, just, um...

37:07.696 --> 37:09.561
Ms. Beker!

37:09.904 --> 37:13.276
- Jeanne. I am such a big fan.
- So nice, thank you.

37:13.301 --> 37:16.613
- You look fantastic.
- You're that weather girl...

37:16.638 --> 37:20.004
Meteo... You know, I would
love to hear your thoughts

37:20.029 --> 37:22.292
on Toronto Women's Fashion Week so far.

37:22.317 --> 37:24.090
I think it's been an amazing week.

37:24.115 --> 37:25.621
Just extraordinary, really.

37:25.646 --> 37:28.647
What the hell is going on?

37:28.672 --> 37:30.207
Excuse me! Excuse me!

37:30.232 --> 37:32.348
- Coming through!
- Coming through, guys!

37:32.373 --> 37:34.907
You found them. I don't believe it.

37:34.932 --> 37:38.173
Thank god. Stop rolling.

37:42.210 --> 37:44.378
Nancy! Nancy, get these
models dressed now.

37:44.403 --> 37:46.348
Helen, tell hair and makeup we're a go.

37:46.373 --> 37:49.557
- I need to talk to the lighting guy.
- I'll get out front and stall. Thank you.

37:51.653 --> 37:54.207
- Looks like everything was forgiven.
- Pietro and Sonia

37:54.232 --> 37:57.033
may have different visions on how to run
a business, but at the end of the day,

37:57.057 --> 37:59.694
they make good partners.

38:01.714 --> 38:04.483
Can you feel that? That buzz in the air?

38:04.508 --> 38:08.153
This is it. This is my breakthrough.

38:08.178 --> 38:10.755
- Sonia's breakthrough, you mean.
- Absolutely.

38:10.780 --> 38:14.630
House of Caras, by Stephan Caras.

38:17.364 --> 38:21.883
Let's have a big hand for Stephan Caras!

38:31.427 --> 38:33.069
OK, everybody, that's it!

38:33.102 --> 38:35.008
- It's showtime!
- Sonia!

38:35.033 --> 38:37.001
I'm down a model. Estella, remember?

38:39.596 --> 38:41.152
Angie.

38:41.301 --> 38:44.533
Please do me one more
favour. Be in my show.

38:44.558 --> 38:46.491
- No. I couldn't...
- Please.

38:46.516 --> 38:49.184
- I have the perfect dress for you.
- Come on, Everett.

38:49.209 --> 38:51.666
Doesn't get more 'moment' than this.

38:51.691 --> 38:54.012
The House of Valero!

39:29.756 --> 39:32.669
Ladies and gentlemen, Sonia Valero!

39:42.303 --> 39:44.891
Everett, this is incredible!

39:44.916 --> 39:46.535
Yeah.

39:47.533 --> 39:49.533
Great job, Sonia.

39:49.558 --> 39:52.354
- When did you...?
- Over the past week.

39:52.379 --> 39:54.205
- Angie set it up.
- Zoe helped.

39:54.230 --> 39:56.811
Plus I had a hand with
labour and materials.

39:56.836 --> 40:00.604
That was nothing.
I just called in a few favours.

40:00.629 --> 40:04.498
Here. A token of friendship.

40:04.523 --> 40:06.635
For helping me recover
my missing merchandise.

40:06.660 --> 40:09.840
- No, I can't...
- White gold,

40:09.865 --> 40:13.221
I call this. Wait 'til you try it.

40:20.799 --> 40:23.263
- Truffles?
- Yeah.

40:23.288 --> 40:25.923
What did you think was in there,
drugs or something? Gee!

40:25.948 --> 40:29.460
Mannaggia! Those are imported

40:29.485 --> 40:32.786
directly from Italy.
The finest you'll ever taste.

40:32.967 --> 40:34.967
They're banned in North America

40:34.992 --> 40:38.038
'cause some hack politician
has a trade agreement.

40:38.063 --> 40:40.030
The only real crime is keeping things

40:40.055 --> 40:42.422
that delicious out of people's mouths.

40:42.447 --> 40:45.068
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:47.713 --> 40:49.914
You know,

40:50.211 --> 40:53.271
one day, you might call upon
me for a favour.

40:53.839 --> 40:56.220
And I just want to let you know,

40:56.276 --> 41:00.125
that's gonna be an offer I can't refuse.

41:02.392 --> 41:05.130
Come here.

41:05.756 --> 41:07.761
Wow...

41:08.272 --> 41:10.135
I have to say, partner,

41:10.160 --> 41:12.260
I am impressed.

41:12.285 --> 41:15.264
This definitely has the
look of a timeless classic.

41:15.289 --> 41:18.724
And yet it feels like something new.

41:22.196 --> 41:24.991
Crap, I gotta go. I'm hosting a
dinner tonight for Jules and Becca.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.250
- No problem. We'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.

41:27.275 --> 41:29.508
Hey, um, you wanna join us?

41:29.532 --> 41:32.741
- No, I can't crash your family dinner.
- You're not crashing,

41:32.766 --> 41:35.616
I just invited you.
Besides, you're part of the family now.

41:35.768 --> 41:38.705
Yeah. Sure.

41:41.957 --> 41:44.425
- You sure you wanna wear that?
- Shut up.

41:46.362 --> 41:49.555
Can I take your plate?

41:51.238 --> 41:53.382
You're such a sweetheart, Liam.

41:53.407 --> 41:56.234
Thank you, ma'am. So are you. I mean...

41:56.259 --> 41:58.826
just thank you. And thank you, sir,

41:58.850 --> 42:01.156
for inviting me into
your home and for dinner.

42:01.181 --> 42:02.962
All the better to keep
an eye on you, Liam.

42:02.987 --> 42:03.596
Come on.

42:03.621 --> 42:04.402
Lay off him.

42:04.427 --> 42:06.577
I'm kidding. I'm keeping
an eye on both of you,

42:06.602 --> 42:08.850
- simultaneously.
- Jules, how about you and Liam

42:08.875 --> 42:10.898
- help me bring out dessert?
- Yeah, sure.

42:10.923 --> 42:12.657
I'll help too.

42:13.283 --> 42:15.449
Thank you.

42:17.793 --> 42:19.788
This is nice.

42:19.979 --> 42:22.321
What gave you the idea
to throw a family dinner?

42:22.346 --> 42:25.167
I don't know. Just felt overdue.

42:25.330 --> 42:27.253
You were right.

42:28.438 --> 42:29.996
You OK?

42:30.020 --> 42:32.368
I knew this new job

42:32.393 --> 42:35.930
would be overwhelming,
but I didn't know how much.

42:36.004 --> 42:38.370
I don't have as much time

42:38.395 --> 42:40.140
to spend with Jules as I'd like.

42:40.307 --> 42:42.477
And it's not fair to her.

42:43.029 --> 42:44.843
Or you.

42:44.868 --> 42:46.745
What are you getting at?

42:47.382 --> 42:50.896
Well, if you're willing...

42:50.985 --> 42:53.048
I was thinking that it would be good

42:53.073 --> 42:56.343
to switch to a straight
50/50 split custody.

42:56.532 --> 42:58.345
Are you serious?

42:58.370 --> 43:01.162
I want our lives to work, Shadow.

43:03.560 --> 43:06.532
You've got a strong support
system in place as well.

43:06.557 --> 43:09.079
Thanks.

43:09.104 --> 43:11.228
That means a lot.

43:12.542 --> 43:16.344
- What are you guys talking about?
- I'll tell you later.

43:18.046 --> 43:20.047
But in the meantime,

43:20.072 --> 43:23.145
who wants to play Trivial Pursuit?

43:23.170 --> 43:25.770
Yeah! You're going down, old man.

43:26.618 --> 43:28.278
I mean... sir.
