01:20.472 --> 01:21.472
¡Christine!

01:21.903 --> 01:22.903
Daddy what's happening?

01:23.449 --> 01:24.449
Only ...

01:24.652 --> 01:25.342
Sit ...

01:25.601 --> 01:26.601
I will return later.

01:32.104 --> 01:33.246
Please, take a seat.

01:33.525 --> 01:34.525
Thank you.

01:36.644 --> 01:40.408
Leave behind Manhattan Ashborough be a big cultural change for you ...

01:40.640 --> 01:42.050
Cayle Doctor, is it not?

01:42.546 --> 01:43.730
Yes, but I ...

01:44.153 --> 01:45.885
I think it's best for my family.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.750
It was my wife who I hear about this practice by a friend of hers.

01:49.027 --> 01:50.027
I see.

01:50.683 --> 01:53.444
If space is what you are looking definitely find here.

01:54.242 --> 01:56.833
I'm afraid there is not much in the way of emotion.

01:59.579 --> 02:01.697
Yes, but I think we've had enough excitement in the city ...

02:01.901 --> 02:04.062
and we are ready for a bit of peace and quiet.

02:04.201 --> 02:04.949
Good.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.180
Well then.

02:06.181 --> 02:07.788
I'll get right to the point, Doctor Cayle.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.312
The death of my husband has not been easy.

02:11.714 --> 02:12.892
Yes, I'm sure.

02:13.415 --> 02:14.455
Can I ask what happened?

02:14.995 --> 02:16.337
A rabid dog.

02:17.370 --> 02:21.100
Neil used to walk the trails behind the house before dinner.

02:21.783 --> 02:25.384
The animal was captured and removed, so no need to worry.

02:25.633 --> 02:26.196
All right.

02:26.197 --> 02:27.615
For my own closure.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.181
I want to sell ...

02:29.722 --> 02:31.611
The house and its practice immediately.

02:33.189 --> 02:34.610
If the want is yours.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.406
Si.

02:37.543 --> 02:38.702
Mrs. Farris.

02:39.125 --> 02:40.151
Absolutely.

02:40.615 --> 02:43.865
I'm sure you and your family will be very happy here in Ashborough.

02:44.221 --> 02:45.221
Yes me too.

02:45.391 --> 02:47.911
And do not worry premises, they get used to you.

02:48.701 --> 02:49.701
Pardon?

02:50.402 --> 02:52.103
It is a small town, Doctor Cayle.

02:52.104 --> 02:53.898
They are not used to ...

02:53.899 --> 02:55.665
townspeople.

02:56.924 --> 02:57.924
Right.

02:59.028 --> 03:00.268
You will stay in town?

03:00.298 --> 03:01.500
Of course.

03:02.210 --> 03:03.977
I can not imagine myself living anywhere else.

03:26.001 --> 03:27.738
Do not let the dog go up to bed.

03:34.151 --> 03:35.151
Papi.

03:35.175 --> 03:36.848
¿Va a ver un patio para Page?

03:38.036 --> 03:39.637
Bigger than you can imagine.

03:40.371 --> 03:42.258
You should go finish packing your wrists.

03:42.517 --> 03:43.517
Ok.

03:43.559 --> 03:44.623
Vamos Page.

03:49.806 --> 03:50.806
Are you ...

03:51.722 --> 03:52.629
Sure this is what you want?

03:52.908 --> 03:54.254
It is.

03:54.928 --> 03:55.950
So what happens?

03:56.371 --> 03:59.079
Have we been talking about this for so long.

03:59.671 --> 04:02.097
I never really thought we would go.

04:03.494 --> 04:04.994
It's just a big change. - It is.

04:12.748 --> 04:13.748
6.2 MILES

04:13.935 --> 04:15.122
Do you have the map I printed it?

04:16.493 --> 04:18.789
There is only one road in this town love and it is.

04:22.318 --> 04:23.896
NO SERVICE

04:24.412 --> 04:26.941
WELCOME TO ASHBOROUGH

04:38.197 --> 04:40.301
Is is the waterfall? - Yes.

04:40.302 --> 04:42.130
Is there a waterfall? -. Yes it is.

04:42.381 --> 04:44.647
Do not you see? - Yes, it's so cute.

04:58.665 --> 04:59.865
Are you happy that we did this?

04:59.884 --> 05:01.190
I could not be happier.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.375
Mommy, I do not feel well.

05:05.030 --> 05:06.535
Jess, baby, what's up?

05:08.101 --> 05:09.262
My stomach hurts.

05:09.553 --> 05:10.872
I want to go home.

05:11.535 --> 05:12.535
Good.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.830
This is our home now baby.

05:15.646 --> 05:16.872
Are you okay with that?

05:16.873 --> 05:18.216
Papi is good.

05:18.217 --> 05:19.217
Agreed.

05:26.145 --> 05:27.507
¡Maldita sea!
- ¡Michael!

05:28.471 --> 05:29.471
Jess, dear ...

05:30.609 --> 05:31.654
What?

05:31.994 --> 05:33.280
Are you okay?

05:36.867 --> 05:37.919
What are you laughing?

05:38.347 --> 05:39.709
Sorry.

05:44.830 --> 05:46.271
Honey, what are you looking for?

05:47.003 --> 05:48.056
The Keys to the House.

05:49.129 --> 05:52.267
Please do not enter into our new house covered vomiting.

05:52.496 --> 05:53.884
Just change your pants here.

05:54.590 --> 05:55.590
All right.

05:56.811 --> 05:58.408
Daddy, that's disturbing.

05:59.681 --> 06:01.153
Look who feels better now.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.172
Good morning, I heard you are the new doctor.

06:11.264 --> 06:13.120
Appears to be in his first patient

06:13.121 --> 06:14.153
Yes, I ...

06:14.154 --> 06:15.508
I think so. - Ha-ah.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.662
Is this your dog? We find along the way.

06:17.663 --> 06:18.784
Thank you.

06:18.785 --> 06:20.452
Thanks, I'm ... Michael Cayle.

06:20.453 --> 06:21.667
Phil Deighton.

06:21.885 --> 06:22.930
This is my grandson Tyler ...

06:22.931 --> 06:24.368
We live across the street.

06:24.369 --> 06:25.771
This is my wife Christine.

06:26.354 --> 06:27.553
Hello - Hello, how are you?

06:28.704 --> 06:29.986
And you are?

06:30.379 --> 06:31.379
This is Jessica.

06:31.380 --> 06:32.793
She does not feel very well.

06:33.220 --> 06:35.246
Tyler, Jessica give him back his dog.

06:36.606 --> 06:38.086
What is the name of this big guy?

06:38.225 --> 06:39.347
Jimmy Page.

06:40.022 --> 06:41.984
We would be proud to have them as guests for lunch.

06:42.576 --> 06:43.976
For you to meet my wife Rosy.

06:44.495 --> 06:46.983
And we have enough towels in the bathroom for you to clean.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.413
No, no, no.

06:48.695 --> 06:49.885
Do not want to cause problems.

06:50.089 --> 06:51.676
No. No problem.

06:52.660 --> 06:53.660
Come with us.

06:55.594 --> 06:56.665
Okay - Okay.

06:57.309 --> 06:58.309
Great.

06:58.524 --> 06:59.524
Thank you.

07:01.776 --> 07:03.012
ENTER.

07:03.013 --> 07:04.287
No, Page.

07:04.288 --> 07:05.805
Sorry, I'll put it in the car.

07:05.806 --> 07:07.188
Do not worry. Do not Worry.

07:07.710 --> 07:08.910
The bathroom is on the second floor.

07:08.911 --> 07:10.028
On the left.

07:10.029 --> 07:11.207
Thank you.

08:28.830 --> 08:29.952
Lady Deighton.

08:31.295 --> 08:33.587
Hi, I'm Michael Cayle, I'm the new doctor.

08:34.412 --> 08:35.597
I hope I have not bothered.

08:40.342 --> 08:41.666
You can not help me.

09:10.572 --> 09:13.338
I heard that the church is planning a party in his honor.

09:14.756 --> 09:16.104
You hear that Michael?

09:16.853 --> 09:17.989
Actually we are not ...

09:18.190 --> 09:19.279
religious.

09:19.690 --> 09:23.329
It's actually more like a social group.

09:23.935 --> 09:26.074
We would be more than happy to assist.

09:28.963 --> 09:29.963
Some tea?

09:29.964 --> 09:31.184
No thanks.

09:32.608 --> 09:34.048
Maybe we can meet his wife.

09:34.709 --> 09:35.709
Absolutely.

09:36.344 --> 09:37.810
She is still sleeping.

09:38.208 --> 09:40.451
She will be one of his most loyal patients.

09:41.839 --> 09:43.387
I hope it's not too serious.

09:44.582 --> 09:46.053
I'm afraid it's cancer.

09:52.405 --> 09:53.929
That's a beautiful family photo.

09:55.024 --> 09:56.205
Thank you.

09:56.411 --> 09:58.048
Is that your mother Tyler? - Yes.

09:58.982 --> 10:00.142
She is no longer with us.

10:00.962 --> 10:01.962
Where did he go?

10:02.963 --> 10:04.147
She died last year.

10:04.802 --> 10:05.902
I'm sorry.

10:06.571 --> 10:10.172
Tyler, why do not you find pads for your grandmother when she get up?

10:10.529 --> 10:12.140
I think we should leave.

10:12.141 --> 10:14.539
The move came soon and do not want to lose them.

10:15.644 --> 10:17.751
Really? Still not eaten anything.

10:18.207 --> 10:19.467
I had a big breakfast.

10:22.919 --> 10:26.448
Now they are not unknown. There is always a cup of tea list.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.188
Please tell your wife that we would be delighted to meet you.

10:29.189 --> 10:30.266
Of course.

10:31.316 --> 10:32.316
Goodbye Tyler.

10:33.063 --> 10:34.063
Thanks for everything.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.450
Anything just ask.

10:36.959 --> 10:38.159
You know, now that you mention it ...

10:38.959 --> 10:42.438
We must turn our light and our cable.

10:43.871 --> 10:44.933
Let me see.

10:45.965 --> 10:48.478
I'll give you the number for light.

10:48.978 --> 10:49.978
All right.

10:50.002 --> 10:50.708
But ...

10:50.709 --> 10:52.281
No cable at this place.

10:53.469 --> 10:54.469
What?

10:54.689 --> 10:57.074
Well, Ashborough is about community.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.225
But the library has a good collection of videotapes.

11:01.371 --> 11:02.371
So ...

11:06.841 --> 11:07.841
All right.

11:08.340 --> 11:09.340
Thanks again.

11:09.541 --> 11:10.541
You're welcome.

11:11.754 --> 11:12.754
Until then.

11:28.146 --> 11:31.193
You think that little girl knew that one day she would marry a ....

11:33.638 --> 11:34.638
Guapo ...

11:35.368 --> 11:36.538
And strong Doctor.

11:37.457 --> 11:38.570
She knew.

11:39.159 --> 11:40.552
You were always part of the plan.

11:43.986 --> 11:44.986
What is that?

11:44.987 --> 11:46.049
It is the curfew.

11:46.676 --> 11:49.871
When you were in the bathroom Phil told us that the village has a curfew.

11:50.339 --> 11:52.059
Everyone inside their homes at 8.

11:52.388 --> 11:53.749
Are you kidding? That is too much.

11:54.428 --> 11:55.472
I like.

11:56.255 --> 11:58.003
Family first. Do you remember?

12:00.013 --> 12:01.145
Family first.

12:02.791 --> 12:03.791
Want help with this?

12:04.069 --> 12:05.241
No, that can wait.

12:06.909 --> 12:08.052
Let's relax.

12:09.251 --> 12:10.251
Thank you.

12:16.498 --> 12:17.570
For our new house.

12:25.390 --> 12:26.390
What?

12:27.328 --> 12:28.328
Nothing.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.128
You're still thinking about this afternoon.

12:31.954 --> 12:35.212
I tell you, I think he wanted me to enter that room.

12:36.230 --> 12:39.929
If he wanted you to see his wife, I'm sure he'd asked.

12:40.939 --> 12:42.699
Probably heard the wrong door

12:42.875 --> 12:43.875
No.

12:44.312 --> 12:46.032
He definitely said, go left.

12:46.404 --> 12:47.961
Maybe the other bathroom was broken.

12:50.325 --> 12:51.396
He said he had cancer.

12:52.001 --> 12:53.001
I know.

12:53.565 --> 12:54.565
Terrible.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.572
It seems to me that she was attacked by an animal or something ...

12:57.822 --> 12:59.614
Enough with Deightons.

13:00.570 --> 13:02.615
I think you owe me a conversation.

13:09.587 --> 13:10.587
All right.

13:11.821 --> 13:13.425
With all the space we have here I think ...

13:13.628 --> 13:14.690
No, no, no.

13:14.951 --> 13:17.401
I mean ... Okay.

13:19.513 --> 13:20.585
Are you serious.

13:21.072 --> 13:22.335
No more excuses.

13:22.818 --> 13:23.956
Except he drinks.

13:25.144 --> 13:26.225
And I think we should ....

13:26.892 --> 13:29.345
Take our time and make sure we are comfortable here in Ashborough.

13:29.346 --> 13:31.208
Yes absolutely!

13:33.988 --> 13:34.988
I love you.

15:23.405 --> 15:25.445
DEIGHTON ROSE.

15:49.621 --> 15:50.621
Okay.

15:51.108 --> 15:52.108
Carefully.

16:01.899 --> 16:02.899
Hello Daddy.

16:02.923 --> 16:03.986
Hey, hey, hey!

16:05.141 --> 16:06.141
Give me one.

16:07.005 --> 16:08.005
Right.

16:48.445 --> 16:52.127
NEIL, GOOD LUCK. - ZACH.

17:15.141 --> 17:16.481
Ebola - Holy shit.

17:16.482 --> 17:17.777
Bubonic Plague

17:18.039 --> 17:19.320
! Daddy! Papi! Come see what Page did.

17:19.321 --> 17:21.319
Careful, careful. Teach your mother.

17:21.320 --> 17:22.320
All right.

18:14.574 --> 18:16.009
Loren Hunter.

18:16.521 --> 18:17.521
Here.

18:19.393 --> 18:20.764
Take a seat, Miss Hunter.

18:22.236 --> 18:23.581
Doctor Cayle, please.

18:24.315 --> 18:25.354
Es Lauren.

18:26.074 --> 18:27.729
And what brings you here today?

18:28.499 --> 18:29.499
Checkup.

18:29.913 --> 18:31.553
To make sure everything is working.

18:33.665 --> 18:36.401
That seems to be the general pattern of this morning.

18:38.079 --> 18:40.479
Everyone just wants to throw out the new doctor.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.040
Can you blame them?

18:44.128 --> 18:45.128
We will see that heart.

18:58.458 --> 18:59.858
How's that?

19:00.951 --> 19:02.765
No Daddy, you have to stay in the lines.

19:02.766 --> 19:03.808
What?

19:06.587 --> 19:07.646
Sorry.

19:11.238 --> 19:12.238
So is better?

19:13.242 --> 19:14.242
Enough

19:24.566 --> 19:25.566
What are those?

19:26.452 --> 19:27.452
Honey?

19:29.481 --> 19:30.481
Papi...

19:30.717 --> 19:31.774
Do ghosts exist?

19:34.415 --> 19:36.095
Why are you asking about ghosts?

19:36.557 --> 19:37.799
Scooby-Doo Movies.

19:40.159 --> 19:42.294
There are no ghosts.

19:43.201 --> 19:44.946
But I see in my room at night.

19:45.429 --> 19:46.619
The lights scare me.

19:48.415 --> 19:49.912
Nothing will happen ...

19:51.001 --> 19:52.186
While I'm here.

19:53.517 --> 19:55.668
You promise? - I promise.

20:20.229 --> 20:21.656
Hello Michael!

20:22.450 --> 20:24.176
Hello, Phil. Good morning.

20:24.706 --> 20:26.875
I have not seen much since you moved.

20:26.876 --> 20:29.435
Yes, yes. Everything has been very mad and full of patients.

20:31.046 --> 20:32.046
Are you going for a walk?

20:32.869 --> 20:34.228
Yes, I thought ...

20:34.646 --> 20:35.915
Check the trails.

20:36.293 --> 20:38.330
They can be a little dangerous if you do not know.

20:38.565 --> 20:40.347
I can help you if you want.

20:42.231 --> 20:43.231
Yes.

20:43.681 --> 20:45.636
Come on - I guess if ...

20:46.184 --> 20:47.241
All right.

20:56.647 --> 20:57.815
This way.

20:58.784 --> 21:00.137
Are we going to a specific place?

21:00.841 --> 21:03.538
Oh, just a little place I know.

21:05.146 --> 21:06.146
It is not far away.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.448
This is incredible.

21:19.874 --> 21:21.213
I thought you'd like.

21:22.662 --> 21:23.718
What is this place?

21:24.480 --> 21:27.220
Only a piece of land that time forgot.

21:30.260 --> 21:31.260
¿Native American?

21:32.539 --> 21:33.632
Not quite.

21:34.540 --> 21:36.522
Years ago ... Actually centuries ...

21:37.146 --> 21:41.342
There was a race of wild men who populated this area.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.086
They were not Indians.

21:43.087 --> 21:45.309
They were people who lived in isolation.

21:46.629 --> 21:53.189
And all who trod this earth will be victims of savagery "isolated".

21:54.371 --> 21:56.548
That's what the natives called them "isolated".

22:00.040 --> 22:01.205
Lady cove ...

22:01.456 --> 22:04.984
That brought me here when I moved to Ashborough.

22:05.493 --> 22:06.707
The meet.

22:07.036 --> 22:09.407
She can tell the story better than I, but ...

22:10.122 --> 22:13.375
"Isolated" grew in numbers and learned to hunt.

22:14.447 --> 22:17.648
And people decided to make sacrifices to keep their families safe.

22:18.421 --> 22:19.421
¿"Sacrifices"?

22:19.927 --> 22:20.927
Yes.

22:20.951 --> 22:21.951
You know ...

22:22.775 --> 22:25.757
Rabbits, squirrels, deer ...

22:26.492 --> 22:27.552
Any animal.

22:29.297 --> 22:30.498
These are bloodstains.

22:31.389 --> 22:32.626
And they are not of a century ago.

22:35.946 --> 22:36.946
I know.

22:39.629 --> 22:41.949
Are you saying that people still make sacrifices?

22:42.641 --> 22:43.641
Yes.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.681
When I came here first ...

22:45.995 --> 22:49.194
Lady Zellis stress the importance of the traditions of the people.

22:50.022 --> 22:51.742
I'm doing the same with you.

22:56.046 --> 22:58.366
Are you telling me I have to find a dead animal ...

22:58.408 --> 23:00.168
and put it on a slab in the middle of the woods?

23:00.247 --> 23:04.854
I meant that shopped a living animal, you put it on the slab and kill him.

23:06.883 --> 23:08.428
All we have done is tradition.

23:11.234 --> 23:12.638
You can not be serious.

23:12.967 --> 23:17.135
After today, you can not say anything about this to anyone.

23:19.675 --> 23:21.407
Phil, solo es folclore.

23:22.577 --> 23:25.190
No, it is not folklore, is legend.

23:25.714 --> 23:26.839
What is the difference?

23:27.822 --> 23:30.411
Well, legends never disappear.

24:32.347 --> 24:33.867
How long do we have to be here?

24:34.071 --> 24:35.616
No seas melodramático.

24:36.232 --> 24:38.463
They are our neighbors and your patients.

24:39.090 --> 24:40.090
I know.

24:40.213 --> 24:42.054
I just do not think I will be happy to see me here.

24:42.290 --> 24:43.738
Honey, that's ridiculous.

24:44.034 --> 24:46.034
Just look, I do not fit the demographic.

24:46.254 --> 24:48.630
Just give them a chance to get used to you.

24:49.300 --> 24:52.340
Provided they do not find me with a "troglodyte" winner of the Bible.

24:52.639 --> 24:53.940
What is a "troglodyte"?

24:54.667 --> 24:55.667
You see what you did.

24:55.896 --> 24:57.383
Yes, I am expanding your vocabulary.

24:58.669 --> 24:59.669
Michael.

25:00.228 --> 25:01.482
I'm glad you could bring your family.

25:01.483 --> 25:02.637
Of course, of course.

25:02.957 --> 25:04.239
This is my wife Rosy.

25:04.706 --> 25:07.706
Actually not we already ... - It's nice to finally meet you, doctor Cayle.

25:07.873 --> 25:09.421
And you must be Christine.

25:09.422 --> 25:10.838
And Jessica.

25:11.059 --> 25:12.868
Mommy, what's wrong with your face? - Jess ...

25:14.058 --> 25:15.394
Sorry Mrs. Deighton.

25:16.319 --> 25:18.642
Please do not have to apologize.

25:19.891 --> 25:22.931
Let Jessica. Let us know your new classmates, okay?

25:22.947 --> 25:23.947
Sorry.

25:25.708 --> 25:28.054
Let me introduce you to all doctor.

25:29.172 --> 25:30.172
Thanks Rosy.

25:31.844 --> 25:35.327
I was hoping you could end the previous conversation.

25:37.287 --> 25:39.816
I think I already made quite clear that Phil.

25:43.381 --> 25:45.036
Hello Doc., Sam Harper. - Hi.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.347
And my wife Joanna.

25:46.348 --> 25:48.149
Welcome to Ashborough, Doctor Cayle. - Hi.

25:48.295 --> 25:49.856
Listen, I have this back pain ...

25:49.889 --> 25:53.169
You know, if you call the office and make an appointment, I would be happy to take a look.

25:53.259 --> 25:54.413
Andy Godbout.

25:55.544 --> 25:58.656
I know this rash that keeps coming up.

26:14.882 --> 26:15.882
My son AJ

26:16.798 --> 26:19.484
Do not be rude shake hands AJ doctor.

26:20.411 --> 26:22.179
Nice to meet Doc. - Nice to meet you.

26:22.180 --> 26:25.367
AJ enters fourth year at the school this year like Tyler.

26:27.361 --> 26:29.005
That's great, Great.

26:29.222 --> 26:31.219
Are you thinking about going to college after graduation?

26:31.485 --> 26:33.507
My son will not have to go.

26:33.773 --> 26:36.008
Not when you can follow the footsteps of his father.

26:36.221 --> 26:37.221
Right.

26:37.611 --> 26:38.611
Sorry.

26:42.572 --> 26:43.781
That's Lady Zellis.

26:44.242 --> 26:45.242
Who is she?

26:45.535 --> 26:47.363
She runs the club of women in the church, but ...

26:47.564 --> 26:50.699
His family founded Ashborough why thinks she owns the town.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.120
Do not trust her, right?

26:55.976 --> 26:57.016
Why do you ask that?

26:57.088 --> 26:58.648
Okay, you should ... - Hi Tyler.

26:59.033 --> 27:00.108
What do you AJ?

27:00.374 --> 27:02.358
Can we talk for a second? - I was talking to Dr. Cayle.

27:02.668 --> 27:04.086
This certainly would not mind, do you Doctor?

27:04.087 --> 27:05.351
No, it is not, either.

27:06.278 --> 27:07.478
What do you think you're doing?

27:14.163 --> 27:15.163
¡Christine!

27:18.722 --> 27:19.950
¡Christine!

27:23.761 --> 27:26.002
She's not here, doctor Cayle.

27:26.910 --> 27:27.910
Miss Hunter.

27:30.043 --> 27:31.320
I was looking for my wife.

27:32.929 --> 27:35.266
We're just you and me.

27:35.875 --> 27:36.875
Solos.

27:37.592 --> 27:39.193
So I think you should look outside.

27:40.793 --> 27:41.793
What's the rush?

27:42.358 --> 27:43.443
What are you doing?

27:45.380 --> 27:46.704
Only what I have to do.

27:47.128 --> 27:48.217
I have to go.

27:49.548 --> 27:51.339
Doctor Cayle, please ... You do not understand.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.540
Release my arm.

27:53.779 --> 27:55.713
You can help me, can protect me.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.408
What?

27:58.478 --> 28:00.088
¿Protect yourself? What are you talking about?

28:01.057 --> 28:02.057
What is your problem?

28:05.776 --> 28:06.776
Nothing.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.180
No problem.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.458
All right.

28:14.397 --> 28:15.637
Good afternoon, Miss Hunter.

28:23.900 --> 28:24.900
Hey ...

28:25.446 --> 28:26.448
Where have you been?

28:26.738 --> 28:28.756
Was ... Never mind. Can we go home?

28:28.987 --> 28:31.046
Hey ... What?

28:32.034 --> 28:33.962
I just found out ...

28:34.226 --> 28:36.460
her daughter died. - Who?

28:36.726 --> 28:40.033
Lady Zellis. It's not important, just let us go.

29:05.954 --> 29:06.954
Jesus, Michael.

29:08.685 --> 29:09.685
Where were you?

29:09.688 --> 29:10.688
In the bathroom.

29:11.947 --> 29:13.895
I thought I heard someone down.

29:14.895 --> 29:15.895
I do not know ...

29:16.333 --> 29:17.588
Just let us lie.

32:38.034 --> 32:39.362
Are you sleeping?

32:40.333 --> 32:41.980
If, for now.

32:44.093 --> 32:45.729
I'm worried.

32:47.659 --> 32:49.379
He said he is afraid to sleep in his room.

32:50.076 --> 32:51.460
I'm sure it's just a phase.

32:52.210 --> 32:54.442
I think it's starting to get stressed or something.

32:55.030 --> 32:57.093
Not stressed affection, just eight years.

32:57.301 --> 33:00.119
Do not talk to the teacher and she said that children are beginning to separate it ...

33:00.350 --> 33:02.037
Michael ... - What?

33:02.677 --> 33:03.819
I am pregnant.

33:05.521 --> 33:06.550
Christine...

33:07.722 --> 33:08.746
That is fantastic!

33:10.370 --> 33:11.890
I did not think you were ready yet.

33:12.368 --> 33:14.604
What are you talking about ?, why was that we moved here, right?

33:14.605 --> 33:16.095
You're right.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.643
Then you went to see the "OB" or even ...

33:18.644 --> 33:20.892
Actually I began to see the midwife.

33:21.357 --> 33:22.422
Why?

33:22.668 --> 33:24.241
It's what all women here do.

33:24.242 --> 33:25.709
Who is the midwife?

33:25.710 --> 33:27.206
Lady Zellis.

33:27.502 --> 33:28.533
What?

33:29.025 --> 33:31.465
Come on, you can not see .... - Please Michael is my decision.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.869
I do not want to discuss this, okay?

33:35.997 --> 33:36.997
All right.

33:54.958 --> 33:58.051
Jessica wants you to help her with her homework.

33:59.079 --> 34:00.680
Okay, only I have to finish this.

34:03.976 --> 34:04.976
Do you know?

34:05.568 --> 34:08.100
I thought that one of the reasons we moved here was to ...

34:08.329 --> 34:10.049
had more time for your family.

34:12.159 --> 34:13.576
Chris, podemos no...

34:19.692 --> 34:20.705
Sorry.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.005
I know you're busy.

36:02.223 --> 36:03.223
¿Lauren?

36:05.050 --> 36:06.125
You can help me.

36:06.828 --> 36:08.083
You can protect me.

36:09.541 --> 36:10.591
Please Cayle Doctor!

38:26.004 --> 38:28.553
The church needs volunteers to clean so ...

38:29.207 --> 38:30.487
I'll be all day in the village.

38:31.987 --> 38:34.308
You've been spending a lot of time in that church lately.

38:34.593 --> 38:35.593
Michael...

38:36.166 --> 38:37.686
I thought you were going to help me in the office.

38:37.921 --> 38:39.382
Next week, I promise.

38:40.302 --> 38:41.393
I already made this commitment.

38:43.254 --> 38:44.254
Listen ...

38:44.746 --> 38:46.762
Did you hear anything in the yard last night?

38:47.417 --> 38:48.417
Like what?

38:49.442 --> 38:51.082
Nothing, just thought he had heard something.

38:51.954 --> 38:53.354
Probably some kind of animal.

38:54.810 --> 38:55.810
That's our car.

38:56.362 --> 38:57.362
Vamos Jess.

38:57.601 --> 38:58.803
Honey, do not forget your backpack.

39:01.012 --> 39:02.012
Thank you daddy. - Kiss Me.

39:02.012 --> 39:03.012
Kiss Me.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.600
Goodbye.

39:04.624 --> 39:05.624
Goodbye.

39:23.428 --> 39:24.428
Great.

39:44.145 --> 39:45.986
Doctor Cayle, this is Mrs. Winston.

39:46.519 --> 39:48.320
I'm afraid I have to cancel your appointment today.

39:50.278 --> 39:51.584
Hello Doc., I'm Jake Benson.

39:51.824 --> 39:53.744
I have to reschedule for next week.

39:54.639 --> 39:57.356
Hi, I am calling for an appointment that I have today.

40:25.668 --> 40:26.668
¿Lauren?

40:29.459 --> 40:30.803
What the hell happened?

40:39.292 --> 40:40.292
What happened?

40:41.724 --> 40:42.724
Who did this?

40:43.381 --> 40:44.541
"Isolated" ...

40:47.022 --> 40:48.022
Damn.

40:48.323 --> 40:49.684
We have to cleanse wounds.

40:50.663 --> 40:52.786
Chr... Christine...

41:14.905 --> 41:19.650
"The number you dialed is not in service, try again or call later"

41:33.530 --> 41:34.983
Let me get this ...

41:35.479 --> 41:37.885
Are you saying that someone killed her?

41:38.132 --> 41:39.132
Yes.

41:40.700 --> 41:42.218
Who was it again?

41:42.532 --> 41:43.898
Lauren Hunter.

41:44.634 --> 41:45.755
Where is your body now?

41:46.381 --> 41:47.394
I do not know.

41:47.925 --> 41:49.941
I told him that disappeared when I went outside.

41:50.549 --> 41:52.495
Well, are you sure she was dead?

41:52.790 --> 41:54.016
Of course you do!

41:54.602 --> 41:56.666
You of all people should know that

41:56.691 --> 41:58.929
dead do not rise and go for a walk, Doctor.

41:59.534 --> 42:01.238
Look, are you going to help or not?

42:02.855 --> 42:04.040
Listen ...

42:04.428 --> 42:07.773
I suppose I could go to Lauren's house to see if she is there.

42:08.999 --> 42:11.077
She will not be there.

42:12.013 --> 42:14.651
You know what ?, I will go elsewhere to see if someone can help me.

42:14.652 --> 42:16.988
Calm down and I am sure that we will resolve this!

42:32.404 --> 42:33.525
What the hell am I doing?

42:36.835 --> 42:38.134
Need help Doc.?

42:40.983 --> 42:42.423
I imagine that you are a mechanic.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.775
The only one in town.

42:45.278 --> 42:47.158
The car is dead. Would you mind check?

42:47.505 --> 42:48.739
Well I can tow ...

42:48.740 --> 42:50.489
And I take it to the shop if you want.

42:51.095 --> 42:52.315
I'll check when this further.

42:52.316 --> 42:54.479
No, I have a hurry. Could you check it now?

42:54.933 --> 42:55.965
If he's dead ...

42:55.966 --> 42:57.993
there is nothing I can do here.

42:58.558 --> 42:59.803
Is something Doc.?

43:01.096 --> 43:02.096
You decide.

43:05.489 --> 43:06.489
All right.

43:07.665 --> 43:08.665
Lléveselo.

43:21.296 --> 43:22.897
Michael, Thank God you're here!

43:23.101 --> 43:24.102
What is happening?

43:24.126 --> 43:25.197
There's a body in the street ...

43:25.198 --> 43:26.710
and thought it was a "Kill and Run".

43:26.711 --> 43:28.388
Who is it? - What happened to you?

43:29.491 --> 43:31.220
Sorry! Sorry!

43:43.227 --> 43:44.539
Michael, No...

43:45.861 --> 43:46.972
There are rules here.

44:21.104 --> 44:22.105
Hey, Doc.

44:22.886 --> 44:24.046
Everything will be fine.

44:24.528 --> 44:25.528
Do not worry.

44:31.039 --> 44:32.039
Christine...

44:35.067 --> 44:36.067
Are you okay?

44:36.270 --> 44:37.343
Everything was so awful

44:38.934 --> 44:39.934
Christine...

44:40.624 --> 44:41.683
I'm fine.

44:45.765 --> 44:47.055
Hello. - Phil ...

44:48.201 --> 44:49.201
Es Michael.

44:49.506 --> 44:51.879
I can not talk to you Michael. - No Phil, Phil ...

44:53.470 --> 44:55.430
I have to say what the hell is going on here.

44:55.481 --> 44:57.388
Sorry, it's just ... can not.

44:58.504 --> 44:59.852
Just forget it, Michael.

46:55.079 --> 46:56.079
Taxi.

46:56.080 --> 46:58.075
Yes, I want one as soon as possible taxi.

46:58.353 --> 46:59.353
How many people?

46:59.435 --> 47:00.435
Three.

47:00.461 --> 47:01.231
What is your address?

47:01.232 --> 47:03.003
Calle 17, Harlock, Ashborough.

47:05.015 --> 47:06.015
Hello?

47:06.105 --> 47:08.225
Sorry sir, our service does not cover Ashborough.

47:20.425 --> 47:21.425
Doctor Cayle...

47:22.409 --> 47:23.872
How do you enter? - Sit.

47:24.573 --> 47:25.778
Do not have much time.

47:27.256 --> 47:28.770
Time for what? - Michael ...

47:29.021 --> 47:30.712
They're coming for you. - What?

47:31.469 --> 47:32.469
Who?

47:33.423 --> 47:35.269
You'll have a patient, a female.

47:35.857 --> 47:39.446
You do not know what they are asking for, but Michael, you must surrender his son.

47:40.518 --> 47:41.518
Look ...

47:41.572 --> 47:43.123
I do not know why ... - Listen ...

47:43.423 --> 47:45.373
You did not make the sacrifice.

47:45.769 --> 47:48.571
If they did not need him, I'd be dead.

47:51.211 --> 47:52.297
Who are you?

47:53.532 --> 47:54.731
Soy una Zellis.

47:55.501 --> 47:57.882
We talk about them, we have always done.

48:09.916 --> 48:11.068
Please, Michael ...

48:11.378 --> 48:12.724
It is not defended.

48:52.212 --> 48:53.481
Ayúdalos, Michael.

48:53.983 --> 48:56.224
Here is a disease that we know.

48:57.205 --> 48:58.239
Sálvalos.

51:44.560 --> 51:45.560
I have ...

51:45.701 --> 51:47.210
I have to go back ...

51:47.681 --> 51:49.209
To the office.

51:49.760 --> 51:51.190
I have what I need.

51:51.191 --> 51:52.434
I have what I need!

51:56.608 --> 51:57.608
All right.

51:57.608 --> 51:58.608
All right.

52:19.211 --> 52:20.512
This will hurt.

52:20.862 --> 52:22.289
This will hurt right here.

52:34.487 --> 52:35.487
I do not can ...

52:35.511 --> 52:37.536
It has side effects. I do not can.

54:16.934 --> 54:17.934
¿Papi?

54:18.371 --> 54:19.617
What happened to you?

54:22.629 --> 54:23.784
Clean the couch.

54:24.188 --> 54:26.068
Come Jess, you'll be late for school.

54:26.280 --> 54:27.280
Christine espera...

54:27.414 --> 54:28.414
Goodbye, Daddy.

54:48.364 --> 54:49.364
¡Phil!

54:50.888 --> 54:51.888
Hey!

54:52.095 --> 54:54.605
When finished knock my door, I'll be here!

55:00.723 --> 55:01.736
What?

55:02.461 --> 55:03.517
This is all your fault.

55:03.867 --> 55:05.061
Tyler ... - What is it?

55:06.325 --> 55:08.610
Why could not you do what you were asked?

55:08.611 --> 55:09.744
Tyler...

55:10.307 --> 55:13.147
Do not you think that the grass is a little long?

55:16.362 --> 55:17.362
Yes, I think so.

55:17.531 --> 55:21.385
Well go get the short grass and give a small cut.

55:21.748 --> 55:22.748
Yes sir.

55:33.565 --> 55:35.005
Do you put the goat in my store?

55:37.146 --> 55:39.035
It was my job to teach you the way.

55:39.599 --> 55:40.943
They came for me last night.

55:42.359 --> 55:43.701
I figured they would.

55:44.185 --> 55:47.665
Why did not you tell me the day I arrived, I turn around and I out?

55:47.882 --> 55:49.258
Lower your voice.

55:50.049 --> 55:51.363
They can hear.

55:52.844 --> 55:54.015
I could warn you.

55:54.357 --> 55:55.370
I did.

55:55.721 --> 55:57.868
I sent the room so you saw Rosy.

55:58.802 --> 55:59.933
That was your warning.

56:01.832 --> 56:03.003
I want to leave here.

56:03.210 --> 56:03.938
Now.

56:03.938 --> 56:04.938
It is night.

56:05.218 --> 56:06.666
We will use your car and ...

56:07.009 --> 56:08.009
I do not have a car.

56:09.104 --> 56:10.104
All right.

56:10.554 --> 56:12.599
Then I'll walk.

56:13.217 --> 56:16.358
LA is like two miles from here, right?

56:16.844 --> 56:20.623
You probably already guessed that Neil Ferris was not attacked by a dog.

56:23.178 --> 56:25.876
Even if you escape, no one will help.

56:27.893 --> 56:30.213
They are more expanded than you think.

56:33.815 --> 56:35.112
Well I'll tell Christine.

56:37.122 --> 56:38.858
No I think you have to worry about it

56:39.798 --> 56:40.805
What do you mean?

56:42.587 --> 56:43.960
Rosy knew this.

56:44.942 --> 56:46.191
Long before me.

56:48.531 --> 56:49.531
Mi Rosy.

56:55.379 --> 56:56.379
¿Phil?

56:57.015 --> 56:58.218
They took her, Michael.

56:59.729 --> 57:00.998
They came to my house.

57:02.089 --> 57:03.162
In my room.

57:03.491 --> 57:04.787
I was sleeping.

57:05.066 --> 57:06.157
And they took.

57:06.593 --> 57:07.686
The recover

57:09.794 --> 57:10.794
It's too late.

57:12.946 --> 57:13.946
I found this ...

57:16.595 --> 57:19.604
This morning, put on his side of the bed.

57:31.131 --> 57:32.174
Hello Doctor!

57:32.502 --> 57:36.303
Hi Tim, how are you? Sorry, I'm a little distracted.

57:36.532 --> 57:37.532
Do not worry.

57:37.903 --> 57:40.278
Hey, how will practice these days? Are there many new patients?

57:40.279 --> 57:42.132
Yes, everything is fine. - Oh that's good.

57:43.630 --> 57:45.456
And how is your wife Joanna?

57:45.724 --> 57:47.565
And must be ready for delivery right?

57:47.674 --> 57:48.906
Joanna is not pregnant.

57:49.699 --> 57:50.865
I thought he was ...

57:51.261 --> 57:52.368
I have to go.

58:10.046 --> 58:11.167
The van is fixed.

58:12.223 --> 58:13.905
Did he say that was wrong? - Do not ask.

58:15.354 --> 58:18.866
Hey babe, can you go in for a second? I have to talk to you mom.

58:25.339 --> 58:26.451
What do you Michael?

58:28.446 --> 58:29.446
Where were you today?

58:29.678 --> 58:30.956
In the church with Joanna.

58:31.744 --> 58:32.744
All day?

58:33.445 --> 58:34.703
What are you trying to say?

58:35.488 --> 58:37.948
Think you know more about this people that what you're saying?

58:37.949 --> 58:39.171
I do not want to talk about it.

58:39.898 --> 58:41.068
I can not talk about it.

58:41.317 --> 58:42.708
Let's go.

58:43.036 --> 58:44.638
Let's get to that truck and get out of here.

58:44.639 --> 58:46.829
We can not leave, look what happened to Joanna.

58:48.010 --> 58:49.568
What are you talking about? - No matter.

58:49.914 --> 58:50.914
No.

58:51.479 --> 58:52.479
Tell me what you know.

58:52.973 --> 58:54.815
I know enough to keep my mouth shut.

58:55.218 --> 58:56.378
And you should do the same.

58:57.146 --> 58:58.154
Háblame. - Suéltame.

58:58.355 --> 59:00.101
Please. - I said let me go.

59:06.922 --> 59:08.917
I think it's time for you to take the dog for a walk.

59:10.632 --> 59:11.883
Before it is too late.

59:24.352 --> 59:26.248
Mami. - Wait a minute, baby!

59:49.704 --> 59:50.704
Sorry, Page.

59:58.768 --> 59:59.768
¿Papi?

01:00:01.179 --> 01:00:02.179
Jessica...

01:00:06.015 --> 01:00:07.175
What are you doing out here, baby?

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:10.981
Did take a walk to page you?

01:00:16.081 --> 01:00:17.081
¡No!

01:00:17.283 --> 01:00:19.534
Baby, keep your eyes on me. Come here, here.

01:00:19.779 --> 01:00:22.256
Just look at me. Look at me, me.

01:00:23.233 --> 01:00:24.413
Keep your eyes closed.

01:00:31.633 --> 01:00:35.394
Jessica Miranda Cayle, do not ever leave the house without asking.

01:00:35.661 --> 01:00:36.661
Page, escaped.

01:00:36.864 --> 01:00:37.864
Did?

01:00:38.175 --> 01:00:39.654
Can we go look? - He will return.

01:00:39.655 --> 01:00:42.077
I do not want you back to that forest again, you hear me?

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.200
¡Page!

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.528
Page! - Come on honey.

01:01:18.196 --> 01:01:19.196
It's dinnertime.

01:01:22.349 --> 01:01:23.412
When will Page?

01:01:23.654 --> 01:01:26.063
What was it that told you about going to these forests?

01:01:26.467 --> 01:01:27.667
They are not safe.

01:01:33.955 --> 01:01:35.146
Good morning, ah ...

01:01:35.549 --> 01:01:36.905
Mrs. Wilson.

01:01:56.919 --> 01:01:57.950
Good morning.

01:01:59.054 --> 01:02:00.054
Jess...

01:02:01.507 --> 01:02:02.743
It's time to go to school.

01:02:30.266 --> 01:02:31.743
You know that is not going to help!

01:02:33.114 --> 01:02:34.114
Ve a tú casa.

01:02:36.782 --> 01:02:38.506
They will find a way inside.

01:02:39.315 --> 01:02:40.315
They always do.

01:02:40.685 --> 01:02:41.843
Goodbye, Tyler.

01:02:47.974 --> 01:02:48.974
Good luck.

01:02:56.434 --> 01:02:57.555
Through Christ, Michael.

01:03:42.635 --> 01:03:43.979
Will not let you, Jess.

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:00.969
¿Page?

01:07:14.184 --> 01:07:16.227
He heard us Michael. He heard everything.

01:07:19.774 --> 01:07:21.895
I should not have said anything.

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.112
What?

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:41.490
No.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:47.980
Get away from her!

01:07:59.216 --> 01:08:00.216
Sorry, Phil.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.321
Do not let him hurt.

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.015
Do not let her hurt Tyler.

01:08:41.679 --> 01:08:42.679
¿Papi?

01:08:43.259 --> 01:08:44.361
Hello Princess.

01:08:45.107 --> 01:08:46.107
Where is Teddy?

01:08:46.631 --> 01:08:47.631
Here.

01:08:51.435 --> 01:08:52.435
Thank you.

01:08:53.848 --> 01:08:54.848
You're welcome.

01:09:32.617 --> 01:09:33.777
The door had no insurance.

01:09:34.823 --> 01:09:35.823
Tyler.

01:09:37.434 --> 01:09:38.743
The photos are a bit ...

01:09:38.745 --> 01:09:40.477
Fascinating, do not you think?

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.272
All these details ...

01:09:42.848 --> 01:09:44.426
You pick closely.

01:09:46.033 --> 01:09:47.473
Is there something that I can help you?

01:09:49.126 --> 01:09:50.413
I have nothing to go.

01:09:56.146 --> 01:09:57.146
What?

01:10:13.399 --> 01:10:14.845
Why did you bring this into my house?

01:10:15.098 --> 01:10:16.785
I know you've been in the caves, Michael.

01:10:18.044 --> 01:10:19.666
You have to help. - Help you what?

01:10:20.725 --> 01:10:21.825
Kill them all.

01:10:24.781 --> 01:10:26.036
Tyler, I'd like to help.

01:10:26.968 --> 01:10:28.289
But do not know what you're talking about.

01:10:29.042 --> 01:10:30.338
You can not ignore this.

01:10:30.774 --> 01:10:32.504
They will come for your family too.

01:10:33.368 --> 01:10:35.033
You are the only one who can approach them.

01:10:35.557 --> 01:10:36.557
I'm being watched.

01:10:36.882 --> 01:10:38.008
Maybe you should go home.

01:10:39.893 --> 01:10:42.913
Yes you talked to the people of this town on your situation ...

01:10:43.583 --> 01:10:44.704
Let them help you.

01:10:44.936 --> 01:10:45.936
Please ...

01:10:46.127 --> 01:10:49.665
Zellis the drug, brainwashed and does what he wants.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:51.567
She is half "isolated", Michael.

01:10:52.083 --> 01:10:53.148
His whole family is.

01:10:53.494 --> 01:10:56.259
If you do what they tell you protect you, but if not ....

01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.600
First it was my mother ...

01:11:00.251 --> 01:11:01.667
And then there were my grandparents.

01:11:02.529 --> 01:11:03.684
Oh, olvídalo.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:06.178
I'm leaving this town.

01:11:10.269 --> 01:11:11.989
I hope Jessica have better luck than me!

01:11:27.737 --> 01:11:28.737
Hey, Tyler!

01:11:31.734 --> 01:11:33.043
Everything will be fine, man.

01:11:33.391 --> 01:11:35.553
Just ... we must move forward.

01:11:40.242 --> 01:11:41.242
He's right.

01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:42.515
Would go futile.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.160
Michael...

01:12:49.206 --> 01:12:50.206
We leave the village.

01:12:50.207 --> 01:12:51.405
We can not leave.

01:12:51.812 --> 01:12:53.321
Jess has to go to school.

01:12:53.777 --> 01:12:54.835
Jess, are you going on vacation?

01:12:55.054 --> 01:12:56.914
Shall we go to the beach? - Sure, where you want.

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.140
Please, Chris.

01:13:08.144 --> 01:13:09.162
We have to try.

01:13:11.615 --> 01:13:13.311
All right. Let's go.

01:13:25.882 --> 01:13:27.184
Dame a breath.

01:13:42.701 --> 01:13:43.953
Good afternoon, doctor.

01:13:45.056 --> 01:13:46.056
Christine.

01:13:46.325 --> 01:13:47.325
Sheriff.

01:13:49.241 --> 01:13:50.458
Why not ...?

01:13:51.783 --> 01:13:53.920
Ground vehicle and walk away for a moment.

01:13:55.684 --> 01:13:56.684
Of course.

01:14:05.039 --> 01:14:06.129
Not you ...

01:14:06.361 --> 01:14:09.193
You'd have an idea of ​​what happened to Phil Deighton, right?

01:14:10.973 --> 01:14:12.133
No more than you have.

01:14:12.792 --> 01:14:13.792
I'm sure.

01:14:14.195 --> 01:14:16.210
I think it's better to go to the station.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:17.535
Why?

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:18.766
I played breaking the curfew.

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:20.222
But you have bags in the trunk.

01:14:20.411 --> 01:14:22.596
You left me no choice.

01:14:23.232 --> 01:14:25.211
You and I are not going anywhere, I do not know what you're talking about.

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:26.527
I'll tell you ...

01:14:26.917 --> 01:14:29.437
Because we do not do everyone a favor, and he goes with his family ....

01:14:30.302 --> 01:14:31.318
Returned home.

01:14:33.362 --> 01:14:35.152
Please, doc.

01:14:36.434 --> 01:14:38.607
Have a seat belt, Bebe? - Huh?

01:14:39.028 --> 01:14:41.259
I want you to close your eyes and tell me.

01:14:41.582 --> 01:14:43.375
Open them when you count to 30.

01:14:43.659 --> 01:14:44.659
All right.

01:14:45.017 --> 01:14:47.966
1 ... 2 ... 3 ...

01:14:48.388 --> 01:14:50.039
4 ... - Sorry.

01:14:50.336 --> 01:14:51.379
5... 6...

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.306
I will not take my family back to that place there.

01:14:53.517 --> 01:14:55.799
8 ... 9 ...

01:14:56.055 --> 01:14:57.430
What are they doing? Help!

01:14:58.434 --> 01:14:59.481
Tyler! - Help!

01:15:00.825 --> 01:15:02.119
Raise your hands!

01:15:04.237 --> 01:15:05.237
Please, doc.!

01:15:05.586 --> 01:15:07.026
I do not want to do this but I will!

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:11.044
17 ... 18 ... 19 ... 20 ...

01:15:11.045 --> 01:15:13.446
21 ... 22 ... 23 ... 24 ...

01:15:16.002 --> 01:15:17.776
26 ... 27 ...

01:15:19.261 --> 01:15:20.290
Go Go go!

01:16:08.338 --> 01:16:09.524
What is happening?

01:16:10.059 --> 01:16:12.459
Keep doors locked. Do not open until you return.

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:13.860
Baby, how can you give me that bag?

01:16:13.983 --> 01:16:15.109
What if you do not return?

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:16.404
I will.

01:16:16.841 --> 01:16:18.171
And out of here forever.

01:16:20.684 --> 01:16:21.684
Daddy, I have fear.

01:16:22.293 --> 01:16:23.293
Do not worry, baby.

01:16:24.048 --> 01:16:25.048
Everything will be OK.

01:17:16.676 --> 01:17:17.676
Sure ...

01:17:41.039 --> 01:17:42.039
No...

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:13.648
Mommy, I want to leave here!

01:18:14.391 --> 01:18:16.391
We will, baby. Just wait until daddy again.

01:18:19.416 --> 01:18:20.416
What's up, baby?

01:18:22.287 --> 01:18:23.488
The ghosts are here.

01:18:30.809 --> 01:18:32.935
Do not say anything to him! I promise!

01:18:33.807 --> 01:18:36.486
What does the doctor? - I do not know!

01:18:38.799 --> 01:18:41.716
I hope you're not lying to me I told you I do not know!

01:18:42.817 --> 01:18:44.230
I did not say anything!

01:18:50.752 --> 01:18:52.262
You have been a problem ...

01:18:52.718 --> 01:18:54.246
For too long.

01:19:00.184 --> 01:19:01.184
¡Mami!

01:19:01.208 --> 01:19:02.476
Okay, baby. I'm here.

01:19:08.619 --> 01:19:09.619
¡Basta!

01:19:09.805 --> 01:19:10.805
¡Váyanse!

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:14.882
Back off!

01:19:15.578 --> 01:19:16.579
¡Behind!

01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:21.150
Forward ...

01:19:21.213 --> 01:19:22.213
Lléveselo.

01:19:35.942 --> 01:19:36.942
Already they go?

01:19:37.438 --> 01:19:38.438
Maybe ...

01:19:45.992 --> 01:19:46.992
¡And atrás!

01:19:47.893 --> 01:19:48.893
¡Agáchate!

01:20:15.567 --> 01:20:16.753
¡Cathars!

01:20:17.259 --> 01:20:18.351
¡Cathars!

01:20:19.475 --> 01:20:20.521
¡Cathars!

01:20:24.749 --> 01:20:26.002
¡Cathars!

01:20:32.618 --> 01:20:33.618
¡Michael, cuidado!

01:20:45.905 --> 01:20:46.905
Open the door

01:21:47.543 --> 01:21:48.583
Is everyone all right?

01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:50.830
We're fine.

01:21:58.845 --> 01:21:59.845
God!

01:22:13.188 --> 01:22:14.188
Maybe if ...

01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:15.805
We return home, and locked ourselves.

01:22:15.806 --> 01:22:17.211
I'm dead if we return.

01:22:18.204 --> 01:22:19.204
She frame me.

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:20.834
I want to leave here?

01:22:21.357 --> 01:22:22.357
Please, Daddy.

01:22:22.563 --> 01:22:24.231
Do not worry, baby, that's exactly what we'll do.

01:22:24.712 --> 01:22:25.776
Find a way out.

01:22:27.941 --> 01:22:28.941
Michael, yo...

01:22:28.942 --> 01:22:30.035
I need to tell you something.

01:22:30.068 --> 01:22:31.068
What?

01:22:31.069 --> 01:22:32.346
He baby ... - Beware!

01:22:46.292 --> 01:22:47.693
Is everyone all right?

01:22:48.117 --> 01:22:48.603
Yes.

01:22:49.009 --> 01:22:50.009
Yes.

01:22:55.635 --> 01:22:56.635
Jessica let me see.

01:22:57.398 --> 01:22:59.408
Let me see, let me see. Come here, are you okay?

01:22:59.653 --> 01:23:00.653
Yes.

01:23:01.089 --> 01:23:02.089
Are you okay?

01:23:04.768 --> 01:23:05.768
Sorry.

01:23:07.432 --> 01:23:08.432
Well ...

01:23:08.433 --> 01:23:09.589
What will we do now?

01:23:20.053 --> 01:23:21.053
Will the house.

01:23:30.049 --> 01:23:31.491
Michael ... - Just keep walking.

01:23:32.286 --> 01:23:33.904
Are you okay? - I need to go.

01:23:53.126 --> 01:23:54.786
! Go in! Go! Go!

01:23:59.677 --> 01:24:00.677
¡No!

01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:02.517
¡Michael!

01:24:03.003 --> 01:24:04.299
Help me!

01:24:05.686 --> 01:24:06.686
Help me!

01:24:13.161 --> 01:24:15.001
Help me!

01:24:15.952 --> 01:24:16.984
Help me!

01:24:28.735 --> 01:24:30.304
Jess ... Honey, come here.

01:24:31.931 --> 01:24:33.758
I believe Dr. Ferris discovered something.

01:24:34.897 --> 01:24:36.379
I do not think is it a good idea.

01:24:36.702 --> 01:24:37.856
We have no choice now.

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:43.058
This infection will spread faster than you think.

01:24:43.965 --> 01:24:45.286
I think we have a chance.

01:24:45.463 --> 01:24:46.463
Just be careful.

01:25:00.046 --> 01:25:01.046
VIRUS JUNIN

01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:04.459
VIRUS HARE fibroma, HIV

01:25:15.479 --> 01:25:16.479
Have you had any luck?

01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:18.109
Just a little detail.

01:25:19.961 --> 01:25:20.961
Are you okay?

01:25:21.515 --> 01:25:22.515
Not very well.

01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:24.530
I think you should go up.

01:25:35.512 --> 01:25:36.512
Thank you.

01:25:40.363 --> 01:25:41.550
I do not want you to go.

01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:45.489
Come for me anyway.

01:25:46.902 --> 01:25:48.542
I wish there was another way out.

01:25:50.179 --> 01:25:51.179
So do I.

01:25:53.226 --> 01:25:54.240
Think it will be.

01:25:55.377 --> 01:25:56.620
All of them.

01:26:07.077 --> 01:26:08.077
Michael...

01:26:12.426 --> 01:26:13.426
What?

01:26:16.051 --> 01:26:17.051
I love you.

01:26:19.181 --> 01:26:20.181
I love you too.

01:26:26.132 --> 01:26:27.132
¿Jessica?

01:26:29.432 --> 01:26:30.432
Where is she?

01:26:32.652 --> 01:26:33.652
¡Jessica!

01:26:36.814 --> 01:26:38.511
OMG! She's out!

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:42.880
I'll go for it!

01:26:42.881 --> 01:26:44.817
No, no! You can not in that condition, I will!

01:27:10.084 --> 01:27:12.446
Bubonic Plague

01:30:21.882 --> 01:30:22.882
Jessica.

01:30:27.001 --> 01:30:28.001
¡Jessica!

01:30:31.187 --> 01:30:32.187
Girl!

01:30:50.014 --> 01:30:51.014
¡Jessica!

01:31:04.073 --> 01:31:05.073
Jessica.

01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:17.710
¿Jess?

01:31:17.937 --> 01:31:18.937
Papi.

01:31:27.724 --> 01:31:29.314
Baby, let me see if they hurt you.

01:31:29.892 --> 01:31:31.777
Well, tomatoes are.

01:31:32.452 --> 01:31:34.715
Tomatoes are, okay?

01:31:35.503 --> 01:31:36.503
Just Swallow.

01:31:37.187 --> 01:31:38.187
Is it okay?

01:31:40.491 --> 01:31:41.491
Come on.

01:31:44.325 --> 01:31:45.325
One more. one more.

01:31:46.799 --> 01:31:48.667
I do not can. - Try, baby try.

01:31:49.336 --> 01:31:50.601
Try it, you can do it.

01:31:51.536 --> 01:31:52.659
Good work, baby.

01:31:53.209 --> 01:31:54.827
Good work.

01:31:55.748 --> 01:31:56.748
Good work.

01:31:57.057 --> 01:31:58.057
You did it.

01:31:58.766 --> 01:31:59.766
You did it, baby.

01:33:44.473 --> 01:33:45.473
¿Jessica?

01:33:47.187 --> 01:33:48.187
¡Jess!

01:33:48.274 --> 01:33:49.804
All right. Oh, my God.

01:33:51.119 --> 01:33:52.119
¿Jess?

01:33:52.176 --> 01:33:53.176
¿Girl?

01:33:53.707 --> 01:33:54.707
¿Girl?

01:33:55.379 --> 01:33:56.379
¿Girl?

01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:00.410
Oh God.

01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:39.149
¿Papi?

01:35:43.502 --> 01:35:44.502
¡Christine!

01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:46.311
Daddy what's happening?

01:35:46.638 --> 01:35:47.638
Only ...

01:35:47.743 --> 01:35:49.149
Sit. I will return later.

01:35:56.547 --> 01:35:57.547
¡Christine!

01:36:00.661 --> 01:36:01.661

01:36:08.823 --> 01:36:09.823
Let him in!

01:36:10.799 --> 01:36:11.877
¡No empujes!

01:36:13.362 --> 01:36:14.362
Christine...

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:16.402
¿Christine?

01:36:17.684 --> 01:36:18.918
¡Michael!

01:36:20.169 --> 01:36:21.481
It was not supposed to be like this!

01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:24.550
What is happening?

01:36:25.289 --> 01:36:27.363
I wanted to tell you, but I could not!

01:36:29.151 --> 01:36:30.231
Tell me, what baby?

01:36:31.698 --> 01:36:33.896
Sorry to bring you here!

01:36:37.363 --> 01:36:38.363
Okay, now ...

01:36:38.387 --> 01:36:39.872
Come on. Push! Push!

01:36:44.658 --> 01:36:46.330
Adelante! Let's push!

01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:53.673
Oh God!

01:37:08.091 --> 01:37:09.091
Someday ...

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:11.010
She spoke for them too.

01:37:38.052 --> 01:37:39.052
¡Christine!

01:37:42.029 --> 01:37:43.371
¡Jessica!
