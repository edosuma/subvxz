00:01.167 --> 00:02.429
Hey, Leslie.
Hey.

00:02.502 --> 00:05.130
Thank you for that year-over-year
maintenance cost analysis.

00:05.205 --> 00:06.502
That was really helpful.
You're so welcome.

00:06.573 --> 00:08.507
I was thinking about you
when I wrote it.

00:08.575 --> 00:10.304
'Cause I was, um...

00:11.311 --> 00:13.245
'Cause I told you
I wanted to read it?

00:13.313 --> 00:14.371
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

00:14.447 --> 00:15.607
That's a good reason.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.344
Anyway, Chris wants to
see us in his office.

00:18.418 --> 00:19.544
I guess we should
head over there.

00:19.619 --> 00:20.643
All right.
All right.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.744
All right, cool.
Great.

00:21.821 --> 00:23.789
See you there.
I'll see you there, Benjamin. Ben.

00:24.257 --> 00:25.519
All right, "Lesliemin."

00:25.592 --> 00:26.786
Leslie.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.019
Hi, Ben.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.629
Oh, hey, Ann.

00:33.433 --> 00:36.800
Wow! That was
the most sexual tension

00:36.870 --> 00:39.566
I have ever seen in a
conversation about documents.

00:39.639 --> 00:40.697
It can't happen.

00:40.774 --> 00:41.934
We could both get fired.

00:42.008 --> 00:43.771
That's a dumb rule.
I know!

00:43.843 --> 00:45.174
Well, if you
have to follow it,

00:45.378 --> 00:50.839
I would just suggest avoiding one-on-one,
tension-y situations with him.

00:51.151 --> 00:52.846
You're right. Good plan.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.351
I am sending
you two on a trip.

00:56.623 --> 00:57.681
Really?
Really?

00:57.757 --> 01:00.248
The Indiana Little League
Baseball Tournament is upon us,

01:00.326 --> 01:02.760
and Pawnee hasn't
hosted it in 20 years.

01:03.196 --> 01:06.825
So, I would like you two to go to
Indianapolis and state our case,

01:06.900 --> 01:09.869
because you two
are my dynamic duo.

01:09.969 --> 01:12.199
Right here. Ah...

01:12.338 --> 01:14.363
Ah...

01:14.441 --> 01:15.499

Yep.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.297
Ann, everything
you have is too sexy.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.355
This is actually the dress
that Julia Roberts wore

01:40.433 --> 01:41.695
as a prostitute
in <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

01:41.768 --> 01:43.497
I know.
I look really good in it.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.470
I need, like,
a sweat suit or something.

01:45.538 --> 01:48.029
I need to send out a signal
that nothing is gonna happen.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.735
Oh, this is insane.

01:49.809 --> 01:52.369
It's so obvious you're
dying to be together.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.673
And now you're
going on a road trip?

01:53.746 --> 01:56.010
I mean, you guys could
literally "get a room."

01:56.082 --> 01:57.709
Yeah, and I could
literally get "a-fired."

01:57.784 --> 02:00.218
All right, I will
help you anti-seduce him.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.220
Just tell me
what else you need.

02:02.288 --> 02:05.018
I need to think of unsexy,
boring conversation topics

02:05.091 --> 02:06.285
we can talk about in the car.

02:06.559 --> 02:08.288
I have a few ideas.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.626
We could discuss <i>The New Yorker</i>
article "The History of the Ladder."

02:11.731 --> 02:12.789
Okay.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.835
We could talk about different
dorms at Johns Hopkins University,

02:16.136 --> 02:18.661
and I could read from
my Sonicare booklet.

02:19.172 --> 02:20.469
Oh, I have a good idea!
What?

02:20.540 --> 02:22.098
Why don't you ask him
about his penis?

02:24.911 --> 02:25.969
(PHONE RINGING)

02:30.483 --> 02:33.213
Okay! Everyone stop
what you're doing

02:33.286 --> 02:34.844
and come with me.
All four of you.

02:34.921 --> 02:36.616
Where are you going?
Leslie's not here today.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.088
No boss. We can do
whatever we want.

02:38.691 --> 02:39.783
I'm your boss.

02:39.859 --> 02:40.985
(SCOFFING)

02:41.060 --> 02:42.118
That's a good one, Ron.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.321
Let's go. Seriously.
Come on.

02:44.564 --> 02:45.826
Here's the sitch.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.764
I developed
a dope new game show

02:47.901 --> 02:49.801
where I ask couples
scandalous questions,

02:49.869 --> 02:51.700
and they have to guess
what the other one answered.

02:51.771 --> 02:54.205
I call this <i>Know Ya Boo.</i>

02:54.440 --> 02:56.067
Oh, that sounds like
<i>The Newlywed Game.</i>

02:56.142 --> 02:58.770
Shut up, Jerry! It's not
<i>The Newlywed Game,</i> okay?

02:59.045 --> 03:01.445
It is totally
<i>The Newlywed Game.</i>

03:01.514 --> 03:03.311
But big deal.
Everyone steals.

03:03.383 --> 03:06.284
My favorite movie is <i>Love Don't
Cost a Thing,</i> with Nick Cannon,

03:06.352 --> 03:08.081
which is based on
<i>Can't Buy Me Love,</i>

03:08.154 --> 03:10.281
which is based on <i>Kramer vs.
Kramer</i> or something,

03:10.356 --> 03:11.880
which I think was Shakespeare.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.687
Don't know, don't care.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.320
And what exactly do you plan on
doing with this game show idea?

03:16.396 --> 03:17.988
Are you going to
shove it up your butt?

03:18.064 --> 03:19.053
No.

03:19.132 --> 03:22.226
I'm gonna test it out on you four
bing-bongs and work out the kinks,

03:22.335 --> 03:25.133
then hire actual attractive people,
and make a demo.

03:25.438 --> 03:27.463
What network is gonna
buy a game show from you?

03:27.674 --> 03:30.837
There's a million networks out there,
and they all need programming.

03:30.910 --> 03:35.506

03:41.321 --> 03:42.982
That's a dope show.
Oh, my God.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.718
Yeah, so, basically
every dorm allows bed lofting,

03:45.792 --> 03:48.784
but the students have really
taken to it at Wolman and McCoy.

03:48.861 --> 03:50.590
Did you go to Johns Hopkins?

No.

Do you wanna play
some music?

03:55.602 --> 03:58.867

awesome CD for the trip.

the banjo.

it could be this loud.

someone for a school project.

be here sometime.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.735

05:11.811 --> 05:14.644
Fellas, which rock star
would your lady bang

05:14.714 --> 05:17.046
if she could bang
one rock star?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.549
Jerry!

05:18.851 --> 05:22.912
I believe I have heard Donna
talk about Prince, a lot.

would your lady get with?

Um, this is almost
too easy. Me!

with your boo!

you that, like, a thousand times.

I don't remember.

05:53.319 --> 05:54.513
Why wouldn't you pick me?

05:54.721 --> 05:57.019

technically a rock star.

07:20.873 --> 07:23.000
we may not have enough hotel
rooms within city limits.

07:23.075 --> 07:24.804
I know.
It's a silly rule.

07:24.877 --> 07:27.175
But maybe they'll be
reasonable and not care.

07:27.246 --> 07:28.736
Yeah, maybe we could
just point out to them

07:28.815 --> 07:31.045
there are tons of hotel rooms

it's the simplest luxury,

all the difference.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.987
and Pawnee is special.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.689
I mean, the people
are passionate and kind.

09:19.759 --> 09:23.422
They love their city.
They take pride in their work.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.698
It's a very,
very special place.

Hey, it's Tom Haverford
back here with <i>Know Ya Boo.</i>

09:35.041 --> 09:36.872
Let's move to
the next question.

09:37.176 --> 09:40.202
Where is your favorite place
to smush your boo?

09:40.346 --> 09:41.745
Donna!

09:41.881 --> 09:43.314
Back of my Benz?

09:43.382 --> 09:44.576
Let's check in with your boo!

09:45.718 --> 09:47.618
He said, "Her Mercedes"!

April?

09:51.958 --> 09:52.947
This question is gross.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.186
That's kind of the point.
What's your answer?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.692
In our bed, I guess.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.752
Andy?

No, you get over it.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.532
You like some other
dude's band more than me.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.506
Do you even think Mouse Rat is
the greatest band in the world?

10:08.574 --> 10:09.598
'Cause it's starting
to not feel that way.

10:09.675 --> 10:10.972
That band is
really important to me.

10:11.043 --> 10:12.601
And, honestly,
I've asked you to listen to them,

10:12.678 --> 10:14.612
like, a million times,
and you never have, so...

10:14.680 --> 10:17.148
'Cause their music is sad,
and depressing, and weird.

10:17.216 --> 10:21.550

and everyone knows that.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.621
This is your lunch.

10:33.699 --> 10:37.226
Now, you should be able to do
whatever you want to with this, right?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.861
If you wanna eat
all of it, great.

10:38.938 --> 10:42.339
If you wanna throw it away in the
garbage, that's your prerogative.

10:49.215 --> 10:52.116

40 percent of your lunch.

10:54.453 --> 10:57.013
And that, Lauren,
is how taxes work.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.582

Yup.

You did it.
No, you did it.

11:12.571 --> 11:14.630
No, normally I do it.

11:14.707 --> 11:15.867
This time, you did it.

11:15.941 --> 11:17.704
Well, all right.
You should take the praise.

11:17.777 --> 11:18.937

of you guys?

11:19.045 --> 11:20.376
Yeah.
Sure.

I'm sure they have great
burgers there, though.

you said about Pawnee.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.509
That was really nice to hear.

special town. I love living there.

hang out with the town

13:50.062 --> 13:52.656
and talk to the town
about stuff.

really nice blond hair, too,

at least talk about it.

sleep on my couch.

Oh, that's nice.
Well, she is a fourth grader.

I like Mouse Rat.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.649
All I said to him was that
this other band was better,

18:09.755 --> 18:11.086
but I don't know
why he got all mad,

18:11.156 --> 18:12.919

fact that they're better.

be proud of him and his music.

So, this isn't
really about being right.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.758
It's more about
being supportive.

My instinct is
to be mean to you.

18:32.511 --> 18:33.569
I understand.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.315
O-M-G.

18:37.382 --> 18:38.906
Leslie,
I read that same article.

18:38.984 --> 18:41.475
"The History of the Ladder."
It's utterly fascinating.

18:41.553 --> 18:42.713
Ben, you're gonna love this.
Really?

18:42.788 --> 18:45.416
Do you know that the
original image of a ladder

18:45.491 --> 18:47.516
is in a cave
in Valencia, Spain,

18:47.593 --> 18:48.924
drawn over 10,000 years ago.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.426
Oh, my God.
How about some music?

18:50.863 --> 18:52.660
(FAST BLUEGRASS MUSIC PLAYING)

18:57.269 --> 18:59.567
This is amazing.
What is this?

19:00.939 --> 19:02.270
(VOCALIZING)

19:04.877 --> 19:06.538
(SLOW ROCK SONG PLAYING)

19:06.612 --> 19:08.944
Oh, man, I love this song.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.506
APRIL: (SINGING) <i>The pit</i>

19:12.017 --> 19:13.507
Wait a minute.

19:14.853 --> 19:17.947
<i>You were in the pit</i>

19:18.023 --> 19:22.824
<i>We all were in the pit</i>

19:22.895 --> 19:24.419
<i>The pit</i>

19:24.496 --> 19:27.624
<i>I was in the pit</i>

19:27.699 --> 19:30.862
<i>You were in the pit</i>

19:30.936 --> 19:35.896
<i>We all were in the pit</i>

19:38.510 --> 19:39.636
What is this?

19:39.711 --> 19:40.769
Living out my dream.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.371
Playing a show with
the greatest band ever.

19:43.815 --> 19:46.283
That's my guitar.
You bought it back from Shoeless Joe?

19:46.785 --> 19:49.720
I actually stole it
from his office,

19:50.289 --> 19:51.483
but whatever.

19:51.557 --> 19:52.615
He's a weirdo.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.890
Maybe April doesn't think that we're
the greatest band in the world,

19:56.962 --> 19:59.863
but, man, she loves me.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.194
<i>And I love her.</i>

20:01.266 --> 20:02.995
So, you know, who cares.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.929
I got the greatest
wife in the world!

20:06.138 --> 20:08.072
Stop.
We're married!

20:10.309 --> 20:12.402
We're totally
gonna do it later!

20:12.477 --> 20:13.842
Oh, my God.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.615
LESLIE: <i>Well, actually,</i>
<i>I think it's good that Chris showed up,</i>

20:17.683 --> 20:19.173
<i>'cause I wasn't</i>
<i>thinking clearly.</i>

20:19.418 --> 20:21.409
I love my job,
Ben loves his job,

20:21.553 --> 20:23.544
and it's just
not worth the risk.

20:24.823 --> 20:25.983
Oh, hey.
Hey.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.821
Chris just wanted me
to drop off these receipts.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.952
Oh, well, he's not here.
He took off.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.387
Okay.

20:44.509 --> 20:45.635
Uh-oh.

20:48.347 --> 20:51.646
All I'm saying is,
keep an open mind for a while.

20:51.717 --> 20:54.982
Listen to your teachers and
read all the books you can.

20:55.053 --> 20:58.989
Then when you're 18, you can drink,
gamble and become a libertarian.

20:59.524 --> 21:01.219
The drinking age is 21.

21:01.426 --> 21:04.361
I know. Another
stupid government rule.

21:05.964 --> 21:07.659
So you'll write a new paper?

21:07.733 --> 21:08.791
Yeah.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.425
Can you autograph
this one for me?

21:10.569 --> 21:11.900
Sure.

21:12.305 --> 21:18.591
