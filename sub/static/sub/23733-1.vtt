00:24.685 --> 00:26.659
- Hey!
- All right, Mr. Benchley.

00:26.733 --> 00:28.773
Thank you, Coslough.

00:35.694 --> 00:38.760
- Noah Dugan?
- Yeah, what do you guys want?

00:38.830 --> 00:43.336
Well, you owe a lot of money, Mr. Dugan,
and Mr. Parker wants it. Now.

00:43.406 --> 00:47.148
You've got a hell of a nerve
barging in here like this.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.996
Where have you guys been, anyway?
Parker owes me.

00:50.062 --> 00:52.964
That red-hot parlay l've been driving
paid off in the ninth last night

00:53.039 --> 00:57.316
when Attaboy Star got his nose
under the wire in front.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.108
50,000 smackers. Fat city!

01:00.175 --> 01:03.721
Fat nothing, Mr. Dugan.
Attaboy Star was disqualified in that race.

01:03.791 --> 01:07.467
Set back to third.
Apparently he interfered in the stretch.

01:07.535 --> 01:10.349
You got 24 hours to come up with 5,000.

01:10.415 --> 01:13.798
Mr. Parker's willing to wait a week
for the rest.

01:13.872 --> 01:15.432
Coslough.

01:18.832 --> 01:23.534
- That's just a reminder, Mr. Dugan.
- (Dugan groans)

01:23.600 --> 01:25.509
Mr. Dugan, 24 hours.

01:28.048 --> 01:30.317
How many jobs did you have
in the last two years?

01:30.384 --> 01:33.614
- Six.
- And on the last one?

01:33.681 --> 01:36.583
- Well, there was a little turbulence.
- l'm sorry.

01:36.657 --> 01:43.367
The word's out. Wherever you go,
there goes trouble. And l can't afford that.

01:47.057 --> 01:51.400
Come on, Slabotsky, l broke both arms
flying stunts for you. l need a job.

01:51.474 --> 01:55.184
l would if l could.
Hey, why don't you try Tallmantz?

01:55.250 --> 01:58.250
They're supplying all the pilots
for a war movie over at 20th.

01:58.322 --> 02:00.209
You can fly those crates
standing on your head.

02:00.273 --> 02:02.444
Yeah, l saw 'em.
The picture's been cancelled.

02:02.514 --> 02:05.296
War movies are out. Rocket ships are in.

02:05.362 --> 02:08.975
l don't qualify.
All the pilots are made out of tin.

02:24.851 --> 02:28.332
But l got that flight gassed up, ready to go.

02:28.404 --> 02:32.113
Not with me. No. Uh-uh.
You couldn't pay me triple to take it up.

02:38.067 --> 02:39.660
Dugan!

02:39.732 --> 02:42.514
Oh, what a surprise.

02:42.579 --> 02:47.337
Here l was just thinking about you
and you pop up out of nowhere.

02:47.413 --> 02:50.446
Stow it, Stoney.
l need a job or l wouldn't be here.

02:50.516 --> 02:54.445
l thought you'd never ask.
Come, l'll show you.

02:54.516 --> 02:57.713
This is your lucky day.

02:57.780 --> 03:01.392
This is the easiest money you ever made.
A straight hop to that Pacific island.

03:01.461 --> 03:04.723
The flight plans have been cleared.
One passenger, a bit of cargo.

03:04.789 --> 03:06.383
You drop them there. Refuel.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.618
- What kind of plane is it?
- Back via Hawaii. Pick up another cargo.

03:09.686 --> 03:13.482
While you're there, take yourself a few
days' vacation. Have yourself a time.

03:13.557 --> 03:15.445
What kind of a plane is it?

03:15.509 --> 03:17.451
The word is out, Dugan.
You're in big trouble.

03:17.526 --> 03:21.868
You've been playing the horses
and without very much success.

03:21.941 --> 03:23.316
Open the door.

03:23.382 --> 03:27.027
No job, no family, no friends
with enough dinero to bail you out.

03:27.094 --> 03:29.614
With one exception.
Your old buddy, Stoney.

03:29.686 --> 03:31.661
Open the door. Will you open the door?

03:31.734 --> 03:34.833
l know. l know you're a proud man, Dugan.

03:34.903 --> 03:38.350
A man who hates to hang his head
like a whipped dog.

03:38.422 --> 03:41.586
Therefore, l don't want you to feel that
you have to be excessively grateful to me

03:41.654 --> 03:43.827
for giving you this rare opportunity.

03:43.896 --> 03:46.197
- Open the door!
- You got it.

03:48.535 --> 03:51.383
(animal noises. children's voices)

03:56.919 --> 03:58.829
(woman) Children!

04:08.600 --> 04:10.935
Close the door, Stoney.

04:12.312 --> 04:15.661
- Did l just see what l think l saw?
- What do you think you saw?

04:15.737 --> 04:18.606
Kids and animals and a moldy B-29.

04:18.680 --> 04:22.161
The kids aren't going. They're here
to wave goodbye to the animals.

04:22.233 --> 04:23.924
They were all brought up
at the orphanage.

04:23.993 --> 04:25.335
- No, Stoney.
- No?

04:25.401 --> 04:28.597
Animals and planes do not mix. You never
know what they'll do when you're in the air.

04:28.665 --> 04:31.415
lt's a hazard. lt's dangerous.
And it ain't worth it.

04:31.481 --> 04:34.645
- Wait! Those are religious animals.
- What?

04:34.713 --> 04:38.128
They were brought up at the orphanage.
The lady in charge is a missionary.

04:38.201 --> 04:40.341
She said prayers over them.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.358
Oh...

04:41.434 --> 04:43.344
There she is now.

04:45.850 --> 04:49.047
Come here, my dear.
Come, my dear, my angel.

04:49.114 --> 04:53.816
l'd like you to say hello to your pilot,
Captain Noah Dugan.

04:53.882 --> 04:55.573
Hello, Captain Dugan.

04:55.642 --> 04:57.846
May l present Miss Bernadette Lafleur?

04:57.914 --> 05:00.566
- And Miss...?
- Charlotte Braithwaite.

05:00.635 --> 05:03.766
Charlotte Braithwaite. Who isn't going.

05:03.835 --> 05:05.843
l'm so happy to meet you, Captain.

05:05.915 --> 05:08.914
l've been looking forward to this day
for such a long time.

05:08.987 --> 05:12.402
l've been telling the Captain about
the wonderful work you've been doing

05:12.475 --> 05:15.988
with those wonderful natives
on that wonderful island.

05:16.059 --> 05:18.482
- What was the name of the island?
- Makuarana.

05:18.556 --> 05:20.563
Makuarana.

05:20.636 --> 05:23.003
But l haven't done anything yet.
This is my first mission.

05:23.068 --> 05:26.614
- How soon can we leave, Captain?
- With me? Never.

05:26.684 --> 05:27.960
l don't understand.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.330
l'm not flying you and the Bronx Zoo
anywhere.

05:30.396 --> 05:33.625
- But l've already paid.
- Well, get your money back. Fast.

05:34.652 --> 05:38.777
lt's gone.
Well, you know, expense and...

05:38.845 --> 05:43.449
Mr. Stoney, l hope
this doesn't mean you've cheated me.

05:43.517 --> 05:46.746
Because if that's the case,
there will be retribution.

05:46.813 --> 05:50.642
l'm a missionary but l am not a pushover.
l'll go to the police.

05:50.717 --> 05:54.329
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, please.
Dugan...

05:58.078 --> 06:00.761
- Dugan, l could go to jail.
- Maybe they'll give you your old cell back.

06:00.830 --> 06:05.020
What are you trying to do to me? Please,
l'll make it worth your while. l swear it.

06:05.085 --> 06:07.541
- How much?
- Two Gs upon your return.

06:07.613 --> 06:11.443
- l need 5,000 now.
- 5,000? l haven't got it, l swear.

06:11.518 --> 06:14.453
OK, l want a certified check for $3,000

06:14.527 --> 06:16.251
waiting for me in Honolulu
on my way back.

06:16.319 --> 06:18.206
Or l don't ship your return cargo.

06:18.271 --> 06:20.540
3,000? You got it. lt's a deal.

06:20.607 --> 06:22.363
OK, let me see the plane.

06:22.431 --> 06:26.554
- (child) Brutus is very nice.
- Gangway, kids. Gangway.

06:26.623 --> 06:29.273
Watch it, kid. Those things are dangerous.

06:29.342 --> 06:31.895
Brutus isn't dangerous. He's a friend.

06:31.966 --> 06:34.106
Does he know that?

06:46.879 --> 06:49.563
Lady, you are past your prime.

06:49.632 --> 06:51.323
- What?
- Huh?

06:51.392 --> 06:53.280
Dugan, how about it?

06:53.344 --> 06:57.719
- (child) Petey, come back.
- Stoney, l never saw anything...

06:57.792 --> 07:01.054
- Petey, come back here.
- Bobby and Julie, what are you doing?

07:01.120 --> 07:03.990
Petey went into this tunnel
and he'll hurt himself.

07:04.064 --> 07:07.196
- Oh, her duck.
- (quacking)

07:07.265 --> 07:10.461
lt's started already
and we're not even in the air.

07:10.528 --> 07:13.115
Excuse me, lady. Come here, duck.

07:14.242 --> 07:15.998
Here, duck, duck.

07:16.066 --> 07:17.921
- Don't worry, children.
- Here, duck, duck.

07:17.986 --> 07:21.848
- Be careful, Mr. Dugan.
- Don't worry, l know what l'm doing.

07:21.922 --> 07:24.955
You stupid duck. Come here. Yes.

07:25.025 --> 07:27.546
Come here. Come here, ducky.

07:27.618 --> 07:30.935
Come here. l got you.
l got you, you spatulated pigeon.

07:31.011 --> 07:33.345
Try that again
and it'll be candied yams and apple sauce.

07:33.410 --> 07:35.320
- Oh!
- (bangs head)

07:43.299 --> 07:45.404
Coslough.

07:45.475 --> 07:49.120
You don't suppose our friend Dugan
is trying to give us the slip here, do you?

07:49.187 --> 07:50.943
Uh...

07:51.011 --> 07:53.084
Yeah, that's what l thought.
Let's get over there.

07:53.156 --> 07:54.530
Stoney, do yourself a favor

07:54.595 --> 07:57.891
and set a fire to this bucket of bolts
and collect the insurance.

07:57.956 --> 08:01.305
And while you're at it,
get yourself another pilot.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.930
Mr. Stoney, if he goes, l go to the police.

08:13.477 --> 08:15.517
Dugan, you can't walk out now.

08:15.589 --> 08:17.760
That woman has the Lord's work to do.
She needs you.

08:17.828 --> 08:20.097
You're right, Stoney, l'll do it,
but we gotta leave now.

08:20.164 --> 08:21.113
Now?

08:21.189 --> 08:24.418
See that car? Two guys in there want to
talk to me and l do not want to talk to them.

08:24.485 --> 08:29.472
l don't care what you do.
l'll fly your plane, just get rid of them.

08:35.494 --> 08:37.403
OK, let's get the rest
of the animals loaded.

08:37.477 --> 08:41.438
- But, Mr. Dugan...
- Move it, lady. We'll talk later.

08:43.078 --> 08:45.216
Dugan?

08:45.285 --> 08:47.458
Oh... Yeah. l...

08:47.527 --> 08:49.828
l... l think he's in my office.

08:51.046 --> 08:52.956
Follow me.

08:54.118 --> 08:55.612
This way.

08:55.686 --> 08:58.556
All right, Mr. Dugan, will you take Agnes?

08:58.630 --> 09:03.038
- All right. She won't hurt you.
- (pig squeals)

09:03.110 --> 09:05.021
OK.

09:18.663 --> 09:23.137
Yeah, he must've stepped out for a minute.
But he should be back shortly.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.819
Oh, come in, come in,
let's sit down and wait for him here.

09:26.889 --> 09:31.012
Yes, make yourselves comfortable,
gentlemen. Sit down. Sit down.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.797
Come on, you mule-headed,
slab-sided tub of meat.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.839
Get up here before l leave you behind.

09:35.912 --> 09:37.919
- Hollering won't do any good.
- Yeah, who says?

09:37.992 --> 09:42.434
My dad. He knew all about animals. He
said you gotta talk slow and easy to them.

09:42.506 --> 09:46.150
- Let them know you wanna be their friend.
- Kid, l don't wanna be their friend.

09:46.217 --> 09:49.795
l hate animals.
They stink, they're dirty and they're dumb

09:49.865 --> 09:51.807
and they're dynamite
when they get scared.

09:51.881 --> 09:55.809
Brutus isn't dirty and he isn't dumb.
Watch out, l'll do it.

09:55.881 --> 09:58.696
- Oh, yeah, you're gonna do it, huh?
- Yeah.

09:58.761 --> 10:00.038
Watch.

10:00.105 --> 10:02.211
Here, Brutus, come on, boy.
Come on.

10:02.923 --> 10:04.832
(lows)

10:08.106 --> 10:09.121
See?

10:09.194 --> 10:10.950
Well, you can put another bug
in his ear, kid.

10:11.018 --> 10:13.952
Tell him if he raises any kind of a ruckus
while we're in the air,

10:14.026 --> 10:16.066
he'll end up on a barbecue.

10:16.138 --> 10:19.782
You're the one that belongs on a barbecue,
hollering at helpless creatures.

10:19.851 --> 10:23.331
- Helpless?
- Come on, Brutus, this is no place for you.

10:23.403 --> 10:27.843
Come here, kid, just watch yourself.
The ramp's going up.

10:30.763 --> 10:34.080
He'll be back. He'll be right back.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.293
- Jimmy...
- OK, kids, we're closing shop.

10:36.363 --> 10:37.738
Everybody off.

10:37.803 --> 10:43.205
Miss... uh... Come on, let's get
the little darlings off, we're closing shop.

10:52.940 --> 10:55.013
Be careful.

10:55.084 --> 10:57.320
Follow me, children.

10:59.149 --> 11:04.616
- So long, Petey, l won't ever forget you.
- You really are my best buddy.

11:04.685 --> 11:07.106
l'm gonna miss you a lot.

11:08.141 --> 11:12.102
And you be careful
and you be a good boy, now.

11:13.325 --> 11:15.234
Yeah.

11:33.677 --> 11:34.954
Well...

11:35.022 --> 11:38.339
Looks like the big day has finally arrived.

11:39.567 --> 11:42.796
- We're gonna miss you something fierce.
- l'm gonna miss you too.

11:42.863 --> 11:46.540
Why can't someone else go to that
old island? Why does it have to be you?

11:48.655 --> 11:50.510
Because l'm a farm girl.

11:50.575 --> 11:53.608
l can teach them what they ought to know.

11:55.984 --> 11:57.893
l gotta go.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.327
Come on, miss, we gotta pull out.

12:04.399 --> 12:06.309
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

12:15.409 --> 12:18.224
Up you go. There you are.

12:22.865 --> 12:25.647
That captain guy doesn't like animals.

12:25.713 --> 12:30.088
He said they're dirty and they're dumb.
And he'll barbecue Brutus.

12:30.161 --> 12:32.748
She wouldn't let him.

12:33.778 --> 12:35.949
She might need help.

12:36.018 --> 12:38.865
- Are we ready to start?
- Just about.

13:10.611 --> 13:13.873
- Julie, l'm going with them.
- They won't let you.

13:13.939 --> 13:18.795
They'll never see me.
l'll crawl through that hole like the man did.

13:18.868 --> 13:23.123
- But he's started the engines.
- l gotta hurry.

13:23.187 --> 13:27.857
- Bye, Julie.
- Wait for me.

13:48.053 --> 13:51.152
- Hurry, Julie.
- l'm up.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.131
Hurry, Julie.

14:01.525 --> 14:04.460
Julie, l can't make it.

14:04.533 --> 14:06.443
Hurry!

14:08.374 --> 14:09.323
Hurry!

14:13.206 --> 14:16.108
- (he yells)
- Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

14:16.182 --> 14:18.768
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

14:21.271 --> 14:23.475
Here goes nothing.

14:35.768 --> 14:37.590
(inaudible)

14:45.881 --> 14:47.474
(inaudible)

15:01.176 --> 15:03.086
- Who's in that plane?
- What plane?

15:03.161 --> 15:05.300
- That plane!
- Oh... Uh...

15:05.369 --> 15:07.279
lt's Dugan.

15:08.601 --> 15:10.706
Coslough.

15:18.937 --> 15:20.846
Come on, the car.

15:26.586 --> 15:28.757
(laughs)

15:38.906 --> 15:40.815
Look.

15:42.267 --> 15:45.431
They're waving us goodbye.

15:46.043 --> 15:47.953
(inaudible)

15:48.987 --> 15:53.494
They aren't the only ones.
Hold onto your bloomers, honey.

16:01.980 --> 16:03.541
Come on, Coslough. Step on it.

16:10.492 --> 16:12.467
The car!

16:12.540 --> 16:16.370
- Coslough, do something.
- All right, Mr. Benchley.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.154
That'll fix him.

16:23.645 --> 16:26.580
(Benchley yells)

16:29.213 --> 16:30.937
(Dugan laughs)

16:31.005 --> 16:33.110
- Yeah!
- Who was in the car?

16:34.109 --> 16:36.182
Bill collectors.

16:36.253 --> 16:38.839
- You owe them money?
- Not any more.

16:56.958 --> 17:00.537
Must you pollute the entire cockpit,
Mr. Dugan?

17:00.607 --> 17:02.810
Oh, l always smoke cigars
for takeoffs and landings.

17:02.878 --> 17:05.366
That's the tough part.
You'll get used to them, Bernie.

17:05.439 --> 17:09.628
- lt's Bernadette, Mr. Dugan.
- Oh, have it your own way, Reverend.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.101
(Bernadette) Reverend!

17:17.791 --> 17:23.159
<i> lf l were a star</i>

17:23.231 --> 17:26.907
<i> A tiny star</i>

17:26.974 --> 17:31.710
<i> You'd be my starlight</i>

17:31.775 --> 17:37.657
<i> Half of me is me</i>

17:37.729 --> 17:45.847
<i> The other half of me is you</i>

17:45.920 --> 17:51.288
<i> lf l were a bird</i>

17:51.361 --> 17:54.842
<i> A tiny bird</i>

17:54.913 --> 17:58.296
<i> You'd be my wings</i>

17:58.370 --> 18:05.407
<i> For only half of me is me</i>

18:05.473 --> 18:14.017
<i> The other half of me is you</i>

18:14.082 --> 18:16.952
<i> Reaching out</i>

18:17.027 --> 18:20.988
<i> And touching hands</i>

18:21.058 --> 18:27.933
<i> ls a way of sharing</i>

18:28.003 --> 18:34.627
<i> Having faith and caring</i>

18:34.691 --> 18:41.216
<i> Will always see us through</i>

18:42.115 --> 18:47.963
<i> lf l were a tree</i>

18:48.035 --> 18:51.233
<i> You'd be my roots</i>

18:51.301 --> 18:57.727
<i> We'd grow together</i>

18:57.796 --> 19:01.986
<i> Half of me is me</i>

19:02.053 --> 19:11.459
<i> The other half is you</i>

19:24.005 --> 19:25.915
(classical music plays)

19:43.430 --> 19:46.300
Do we have to listen to that junk?

19:46.375 --> 19:49.409
- Junk, Mr. Dugan?
- lt's boring, Bernie.

19:51.079 --> 19:54.428
Bach was one of the greatest composers
who ever lived.

19:54.503 --> 19:56.642
Don't you appreciate good music?

19:56.711 --> 19:58.467
Tell you what, Bernie, l'll make you a deal.

19:58.535 --> 20:02.147
You turn off that noise
and l won't smoke any more.

20:02.215 --> 20:04.125
Agreed.

20:06.185 --> 20:08.094
(music stops)

20:12.328 --> 20:14.238
(she coughs)

20:33.674 --> 20:35.910
Well, we're on course.

20:38.729 --> 20:40.638
So...

20:47.210 --> 20:48.520
l don't believe it.

20:48.586 --> 20:51.881
- Thanks a load, Stoney. Thanks a lot.
- Are we on fire?

20:51.946 --> 20:56.965
Like everything else in this scrap heap,
the automatic pilot is kaput. Finito, finish

20:57.034 --> 20:58.889
Oh, that's all?

20:58.954 --> 21:04.137
Mr. Dugan, don't worry. lf you're tired
and you want a little nap, l can manage.

21:04.203 --> 21:06.057
- You?
- Yes.

21:06.123 --> 21:08.163
- You can fly?
- Yes.

21:08.235 --> 21:13.287
Well, l've had a few hours' instruction
on the Mission's Cessna.

21:13.355 --> 21:17.479
This is a little bit bigger but with some help
from you, l'm sure l could cope.

21:17.547 --> 21:19.041
- Cessna?
- Cessna.

21:19.115 --> 21:22.891
Lady, you couldn't fly this crate with
a couple of hundred hours of instructions.

21:22.956 --> 21:28.837
l wouldn't be so sure, Mr. Dugan. Anyhow,
do what you want. l was just offering.

21:28.908 --> 21:32.770
All right, Amelia Earhart, be my guest.

21:32.843 --> 21:35.778
Just keep your compass at 250 degrees.

21:39.180 --> 21:41.636
That's very good, Bernie, l'm impressed.

21:41.709 --> 21:44.807
You know, it's amazing what a couple
of hours of flight instructions can do.

21:44.877 --> 21:49.132
- Aren't you gonna help me?
- You said you knew how to fly.

21:49.805 --> 21:52.227
- Mr. Dugan.
- Pull up. Up, up!

21:52.300 --> 21:53.762
- l'm pulling.
- Up, up, up, up!

21:54.381 --> 21:56.453
Up, up, up, up, up, up!

21:56.525 --> 21:57.507
(quacking)

21:58.349 --> 22:00.237
What the hell is this duck doing in here?

22:00.302 --> 22:02.506
Just leave him alone. l'll get him.

22:02.574 --> 22:04.614
Bobby! Julie!

22:04.685 --> 22:06.857
- What are you doing?
- Give me him.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.381
We came here to make sure
the animals made the trip safely.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.788
- How'd you get on board?
- Through the Bombay doors.

22:11.853 --> 22:14.636
- What? You might've been killed.
- (lowing)

22:14.702 --> 22:18.761
- lt's Melinda. She seems awfully upset.
- She probably heard about the barbecue.

22:18.830 --> 22:21.798
- Melinda? There's more kids back there?
- No, no, no, Melinda's the cow.

22:21.871 --> 22:26.278
- Brutus's girlfriend. She's getting sick.
- Oh, great, that's all we need.

22:26.351 --> 22:29.318
- What the hell did l get into?
- You shouldn't curse in front of ladies.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.757
- Look, kid, don't you tell me how to talk.
- l better go.

22:31.822 --> 22:33.317
You stay there. l'll handle it.

22:33.391 --> 22:35.757
Keep your hands steady on the wheel
and follow the compass.

22:35.823 --> 22:39.140
- You can do that, can't you?
- Aye-aye, sir.

22:47.088 --> 22:49.095
(whispers comfortingly)

22:50.704 --> 22:52.614
(angry lowing)

22:54.447 --> 22:57.448
Ah, shut up.
All we need is another one like you.

23:01.137 --> 23:03.525
Mr. Dugan? Mr. Dugan, wake up!

23:03.600 --> 23:09.034
Mr. Dugan, Brutus didn't mean it. lt's just
you shouldn't have yelled at him like that.

23:09.104 --> 23:10.598
- (snorts)
- Mr. Dugan?

23:10.672 --> 23:12.582
(classical music)

23:21.202 --> 23:24.497
- Miss Lafleur! Miss Lafleur!
- What? What?

23:24.562 --> 23:27.344
- There's been a little accident.
- l'm scared, Miss Lafleur.

23:27.409 --> 23:30.758
- What?
- Brutus. Brutus knocked Mr. Dugan out.

23:30.833 --> 23:33.037
Oh, no.

23:33.105 --> 23:36.335
OK, OK, OK, children.
l'm sure he'll come out of it.

23:36.402 --> 23:41.585
Just loosen his collar. Julie, perhaps you
can wet a cloth and put it on his forehead.

23:41.650 --> 23:45.960
Let me know when he's OK.
And don't worry. God is my copilot.

23:46.035 --> 23:48.882
l hope he flies better than you.

24:15.348 --> 24:17.803
- Peace offering.
- Thank you.

24:22.388 --> 24:24.909
You're not angry any more?

24:24.981 --> 24:27.315
Ah, what the hell, Bernie. lt's a new day.

24:27.380 --> 24:30.676
ln about a minute, you are gonna see the
most beautiful sunrise you've ever seen.

24:30.742 --> 24:35.859
Keep your eye back there. Back there,
as far as you can toward the tail.

24:35.925 --> 24:40.115
Keep watching. lt happens very fast,
like an explosion, all red and orange.

24:40.181 --> 24:45.070
You've never really seen one
until you've seen one from up here.

24:53.622 --> 24:56.721
- What is it doing over there?
- l don't know, l can't believe it.

24:56.790 --> 24:59.692
lt's not supposed to come in off the wing.
lt's supposed to come off the tail.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.140
Excuse me.

25:02.774 --> 25:05.011
We're still on course.

25:11.735 --> 25:14.702
- We've been flying the wrong course.
- What do you mean, the wrong course?

25:14.775 --> 25:16.684
l mean the battery from this cassette player

25:16.759 --> 25:19.280
has been interfering with the magnetic field
of the compass.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.351
lt's been giving me a false reading.
How long was that hanging there?

25:22.423 --> 25:23.700
l don't know, a long time.

25:23.767 --> 25:26.768
Oh, great. We have a certain amount
of fuel to get us to your island.

25:26.841 --> 25:29.590
We burnt that up flying in the wrong
direction for God knows how long.

25:29.656 --> 25:31.925
- So what are you gonna do?
- What am l gonna do?

25:31.993 --> 25:35.887
l'm gonna squeeze as much mileage
out of whatever fuel we have left.

25:35.960 --> 25:39.059
- Turn back?
- No, we've gone too far.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.763
(Dugan) Mayday. Mayday. Boeing B-29.

25:59.833 --> 26:04.755
Zero November Niner. One Three
Two Niner. Mayday. Mayday.

26:04.826 --> 26:11.701
Boeing B-29. Zero November Niner.
One Three Two Niner.

26:11.770 --> 26:15.315
Do you read me? Can anyone read me?

26:15.386 --> 26:18.769
Hello? Hello?

26:18.842 --> 26:24.822
That's great. Even if l knew where we were
l couldn't tell anyone. Did you hear me?

26:27.995 --> 26:31.159
Do you really think that'll do any good?

26:31.227 --> 26:34.576
Do you think it can do any harm,
Mr. Dugan?

26:48.092 --> 26:51.475
- Did you find any life jackets?
- Just one and that fell to pieces.

26:51.548 --> 26:53.457
l'll kill Stoney.

26:54.204 --> 26:56.179
(engines sloww)

26:56.252 --> 27:01.206
- What's that? What's happening?
- We're running out of gas.

27:11.388 --> 27:16.604
- Are we gonna crash, Mr. Dugan?
- Don't worry, Julie, we'll make it.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.058
Why don't we just land?

27:19.133 --> 27:22.167
Just where would you suggest
l land, Mr. Know-lt-All?

27:22.238 --> 27:23.896
Over there on that island.

27:26.174 --> 27:30.614
Kid, you got the eyes of an eagle.
We're gonna do it, Bernie.

27:46.462 --> 27:47.739
We're dropping.

27:47.807 --> 27:51.866
That happens when you've only got two
engines holding up a four-engine plane.

27:51.935 --> 27:54.749
- Can we make it?
- lt gets a lot more difficult with no engine.

27:54.815 --> 27:56.505
So you better start praying again, baby.

27:56.575 --> 28:02.522
Kids, get into that engineer's seat.
Strap yourselves in and hold on.

28:02.592 --> 28:04.501
OK.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.190
Thanks, Bernie.

28:19.841 --> 28:23.157
Get behind that wheel.
l may need some help.

28:32.544 --> 28:36.190
- Oh, Mr. Dugan.
- Don't worry, kid.

28:43.650 --> 28:45.024
(engines sloww)

28:45.089 --> 28:46.682
There they go.

28:49.154 --> 28:53.693
l'm gonna try and pancake her
into the beach from the water.

28:58.306 --> 29:00.215
(Dugan) Hold on!

29:17.796 --> 29:20.698
(animal noises)

29:20.772 --> 29:24.514
Come on,
let's go see how the animals are.

29:24.580 --> 29:27.362
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:35.781 --> 29:39.425
Thank you, Mr. Dugan. You must be
the best pilot in the whole world.

29:39.492 --> 29:42.361
Ah, out of the mouths of babes.

29:47.524 --> 29:51.234
Well, l'm sorry l badmouthed you, old girl.

29:51.302 --> 29:53.723
You did real good. Real good.

29:55.173 --> 29:57.083
Hello.

30:08.549 --> 30:13.122
(in Japanese) l don't believe it.
l just don't believe it.

30:13.190 --> 30:15.099
You just sit here quietly, all right?

30:15.174 --> 30:19.265
l'll get some bandages and a splint. You
might've sprained it. Gonna be all right.

30:22.854 --> 30:25.243
l don't think it's serious.

30:27.814 --> 30:30.466
Well, Mr. Dugan...

30:30.535 --> 30:33.218
What does the situation look like?

30:35.335 --> 30:37.724
Lonely.

30:37.799 --> 30:40.254
l mean, what do you suggest we do?

30:40.327 --> 30:43.327
l don't know.
But after that l'm gonna take a swim.

30:43.400 --> 30:49.281
Oh, really, Mr. Dugan, God has given us
minds and we must use them.

30:49.352 --> 30:51.938
Positive thinking is the key.

30:52.008 --> 30:55.837
We have been spared
and we will be rescued, l'm sure of it.

30:55.912 --> 30:59.174
But God helps those who help themselves.

31:02.280 --> 31:06.175
We must search
for any inhabitants of this place.

31:06.248 --> 31:08.802
We must look for food and water.

31:08.873 --> 31:12.735
But first we must
prepare ourselves for the night.

31:14.249 --> 31:18.308
The corral must be built,
the animals taken out and placed there,

31:18.377 --> 31:21.693
the plane interior must be cleaned so that
we can use it for sleeping quarters.

31:21.769 --> 31:23.874
Oh, and some partition
must be put up for privacy.

31:23.945 --> 31:27.262
- Oh, of course.
- Well, let's get on with it.

31:28.906 --> 31:31.589
A little honest work never hurt anyone.

31:31.658 --> 31:36.263
There's an axe in the plane. We'll use
that to cut palms to make fences.

31:38.314 --> 31:41.096
Wanna bet she's also an Eagle Scout?

31:46.827 --> 31:48.649
- Not bad, huh?
- (groans)

31:48.715 --> 31:51.235
- What'd you do?
- l'm afraid l've gotten some blisters.

31:51.307 --> 31:55.169
Oh, well, a little honest work
never hurt anybody.

31:58.731 --> 32:01.960
- Bobby, come on, bring 'em in.
- All right.

32:04.076 --> 32:06.181
Well, here we go again.

32:10.604 --> 32:14.052
Come on. Come on, you stubborn thing.

32:25.773 --> 32:27.715
Now the pigs.

32:28.653 --> 32:31.882
- (laughter)
- l don't know how to grab one.

32:33.229 --> 32:36.098
Come here, you. Come on, get back here.

32:37.901 --> 32:39.811
(Julie) l got one!

32:46.318 --> 32:48.227
(speaks Japanese)

32:50.734 --> 32:54.083
(speaks Japanese)

32:54.989 --> 32:57.445
- We'll be back.
- Well, can' t we come?

32:57.517 --> 33:01.447
Absolutely not. There's no telling
what's in that jungle. You stay put here.

33:01.519 --> 33:03.428
(children) Aw...

33:06.799 --> 33:09.516
Come on, Julie, let's go to the corral.

33:09.583 --> 33:12.169
Come on, Brutus. Come on.

33:25.296 --> 33:27.085
l wonder if there are people here.

33:27.152 --> 33:30.981
Ah, there's probably a Hilton hotel
just around the corner. Don't worry.

33:31.056 --> 33:34.634
- l hope they're friendly.
- Bernie, l'm surprised at you.

33:34.703 --> 33:37.573
Your religion dictates positive thinking,
remember?

33:38.640 --> 33:41.607
Brutus! Brutus!

33:41.680 --> 33:44.364
- Brutus!
- Brutus, come back here.

33:46.736 --> 33:48.646
Brutus!

33:53.360 --> 33:55.270
- Brutus!
- Stop!

33:56.754 --> 33:58.663
Brutus, come back.

34:05.010 --> 34:06.919
Brutus!

34:15.474 --> 34:20.745
Brutus, you're a naughty boy, now.
Come along before l get mad at you.

34:21.683 --> 34:24.235
- That isn't the way.
- Sure it is.

34:24.306 --> 34:26.989
- Brutus knows.
- l wish l had Petey with me.

34:27.058 --> 34:31.400
Ducks know their ways better than bulls.
This is not the way, either.

34:31.475 --> 34:33.612
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

34:33.681 --> 34:34.795
You'll see.

34:36.884 --> 34:38.159
Tell me something.

34:38.226 --> 34:42.351
What made you become a missionary?
l didn't think people did that any more.

34:42.418 --> 34:46.793
- Mr. Dugan, do you really want to know?
- Of course l do.

34:48.018 --> 34:49.873
Well...

34:49.938 --> 34:52.241
l come from a big family.

34:53.813 --> 34:55.722
My mother died.

34:56.788 --> 35:02.539
l was the oldest so l pretty much
raised my brothers and sister.

35:02.613 --> 35:05.711
When they were ready to leave home,
l was out of a job.

35:05.780 --> 35:09.196
The only thing l knew was helping people.

35:10.164 --> 35:13.514
l tried nursing for a while
but that wasn't quite what l wanted,

35:13.589 --> 35:16.306
so then l thought of missionary work.

35:16.373 --> 35:20.170
Why didn't you just get married
and start your own family?

35:20.246 --> 35:22.580
Oh, well...

35:22.645 --> 35:26.028
l believe that wasn't the way for me.

35:26.102 --> 35:31.918
Anyway, the welfare of others matters
more to me than my personal desires.

35:31.990 --> 35:35.602
- Some guy let you down, huh?
- Mr. Dugan, you have no right...

35:35.670 --> 35:37.393
l got as much right as you,

35:37.462 --> 35:40.691
walking around with your nose in the air
like you know more than anybody else.

35:40.759 --> 35:42.995
l guess when you spend
your life bossing kids around,

35:43.062 --> 35:45.429
you think you can do it with
grown-ups too.

35:45.494 --> 35:48.244
Who do you think you are, talking to me
like that, you insensitive...?

35:48.310 --> 35:50.962
Uh-uh-uh! Don't say it, Bernie.

35:51.031 --> 35:54.097
Listen, stop calling me Bernie.

35:54.647 --> 35:57.135
Whatever you say, Miss Lafleur.

36:03.447 --> 36:04.341
Come on, boy. Come on.

36:04.407 --> 36:06.513
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Whoa.

36:09.144 --> 36:11.054
Look.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.793
Come on, let's go tell Mr. Dugan
what we've found.

36:23.064 --> 36:26.064
(Dugan) Must've been
a military outpost during the war.

36:26.136 --> 36:28.887
(Bernadette) These men are behaving
as if the war's still going on.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.742
lt may be they don't know it's over.

36:30.809 --> 36:33.045
l read where the news
never reached some of them.

36:33.113 --> 36:34.423
What war?

36:34.489 --> 36:37.784
Well, we'll just go right down there
and disabuse them of that notion.

36:37.849 --> 36:41.297
Are you outta your mind? They'd cut
you down before you opened your mouth.

36:41.369 --> 36:44.369
- We don't even know how many there are.
- We've got to do something.

36:44.441 --> 36:46.229
Yeah, beat a hasty retreat back to the plane

36:46.297 --> 36:48.600
where there's a little armor
between them and us.

36:48.666 --> 36:50.292
Come on.

37:03.994 --> 37:05.904
Watch it, Bobby.

37:13.307 --> 37:15.925
Are we supposed to hide in here forever,
Mr. Dugan?

37:15.995 --> 37:18.035
What's the matter with you people?
This is no joke.

37:18.107 --> 37:21.620
They're out there waiting for us.
They have real guns with real bullets.

37:21.691 --> 37:23.000
l'll help you, Mr. Dugan.

37:23.067 --> 37:25.239
Thanks, but that doesn't
make me feel a whole lot better.

37:25.308 --> 37:28.025
- What would?
- A machine gun.

37:28.091 --> 37:30.328
Well, it seems to me
you might have a better plan.

37:30.396 --> 37:33.211
lf l had a plan, lady, l would've
kept going the first time l saw you.

37:33.276 --> 37:37.073
- My dad could've figured out a strategy.
- Hey, how about playing General Custer?

37:37.148 --> 37:39.482
We could send Brutus out there
on a cavalry charge.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.817
- He might get shot.
- Yeah.

37:43.036 --> 37:46.234
Hey, the war is over. Now, why can't
we go out there and explain it to them?

37:46.301 --> 37:48.308
l'm sure we could resolve this amicably.

37:48.381 --> 37:51.545
Amicably? We just crashed on their
island in an air force bomber.

37:51.613 --> 37:53.882
What makes you think they'd believe you?

37:53.949 --> 37:57.146
- l never lie, Mr. Dugan.
- Can you say that in Japanese?

38:00.380 --> 38:04.538
Hey, l don't care what you say.
l have a job to do and l'm going to do it.

38:04.606 --> 38:06.515
Look!

38:14.077 --> 38:17.787
(they speak Japanese)

38:18.877 --> 38:21.661
You come out! Surrender!

38:21.727 --> 38:24.661
Be prisoner of war or die!

38:24.734 --> 38:27.931
Friends, huh? Those aren't
exactly peashooters they're holding.

38:27.999 --> 38:30.006
(speaks Japanese)

38:32.607 --> 38:34.014
l don't believe it.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.989
(speaks Japanese)

38:37.183 --> 38:39.965
Last chance. l count to five.

38:40.832 --> 38:42.620
One.

38:42.687 --> 38:43.898
Four.

38:43.968 --> 38:45.309
Three.

38:45.376 --> 38:47.514
Five.

38:47.583 --> 38:49.493
(yells)

38:58.720 --> 38:59.866
Petey!

38:59.937 --> 39:03.166
Petey, get away from there! Petey!

39:03.233 --> 39:06.299
- Petey!
- Julie, stay calm. The grenade's a dud too.

39:06.369 --> 39:09.915
Just stay where you are. Here goes.
Geronimo!

39:11.617 --> 39:13.689
(yells)

39:21.889 --> 39:24.377
- Get out of here.
- (they shout in Japanese)

39:39.395 --> 39:42.209
And don't ever come back.
Do you hear me?

39:43.235 --> 39:45.307
l guess we showed 'em, huh?

39:45.378 --> 39:48.247
You were terrific. Wasn't he, Bobby?

39:48.322 --> 39:51.072
- He was OK.
- Well, thanks a lot, kid.

39:51.138 --> 39:54.302
- Those poor men. They were humiliated.
- Humiliated?

39:54.371 --> 39:56.227
l guess you'd have liked it
if they'd shot me.

39:56.292 --> 40:00.089
- l did not say that, Mr. Dugan.
- Well, then stop feeling sorry for them.

40:00.164 --> 40:03.230
l still think we should make friends
with them. Your way isn't the answer.

40:03.300 --> 40:04.729
l don't believe you, lady.

40:04.803 --> 40:08.578
We nearly get killed and you wanna
open a Sunday school for the enemy.

40:08.643 --> 40:13.215
You listen and you listen good. l'm in
command here and l say that nobody,

40:13.283 --> 40:17.278
but nobody's, gonna open peace
negotiations with those guys until l say so.

40:17.349 --> 40:18.810
Understand?

40:18.884 --> 40:21.339
Now, we'll have to stand watch
throughout the night.

40:21.412 --> 40:24.259
You take the kids back to the plane.
l'll take the first half.

40:24.325 --> 40:26.234
Move it!

40:30.949 --> 40:32.858
Let's go.

41:02.310 --> 41:04.383
(Julie) Good night.

41:04.455 --> 41:06.364
Good night.

41:08.647 --> 41:11.495
Mr. Dugan was very brave today,
Bobby.

41:13.063 --> 41:14.972
l still don't like him.

41:43.912 --> 41:47.044
l thought you only smoked
on takeoffs and landings.

41:47.112 --> 41:49.218
Yeah, but tonight's special.

41:49.289 --> 41:53.347
l figure if l'm gonna go,
l wanna be doing something l like.

41:53.417 --> 41:55.970
- l wanna talk to you.
- What about?

41:58.665 --> 42:05.572
Well, if l have been less than considerate
to your feelings,

42:05.641 --> 42:07.878
l'd like to apologize.

42:10.602 --> 42:13.668
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.

42:14.890 --> 42:20.455
l just think that l may have said some
things to you that l shouldn't have.

42:22.154 --> 42:24.936
l guess that goes for me too, Bernie.

42:27.371 --> 42:30.633
l think we share a common problem.

42:30.699 --> 42:34.660
We both seem to have a certain difficulty
with relationships.

42:34.731 --> 42:39.171
l just want to say
that l'd like to try and get along better.

42:42.219 --> 42:44.129
All right?

42:49.228 --> 42:51.137
OK.

42:54.507 --> 42:57.158
lt's my turn on guard.

42:57.228 --> 42:59.138
Yeah...

43:00.523 --> 43:03.557
Well, if you hear anything, holler.

43:03.628 --> 43:05.865
Be careful of that.

43:06.829 --> 43:11.106
lt would be the Christian thing to do to
make friends with them if they come back.

43:11.181 --> 43:13.548
Wouldn't it?

43:13.612 --> 43:15.849
Don't forget to holler.

43:34.350 --> 43:36.073
Hey, kids, did you see Bernie?

43:36.142 --> 43:38.052
No, why?

43:44.942 --> 43:46.884
- Where are you going?
- To find Bernie.

43:46.958 --> 43:49.347
She's probably started
World War lll by now.

43:49.423 --> 43:51.845
He really is a pain.

43:51.918 --> 43:55.530
Come on, let's go swimming.
l'm gonna beat you.

44:41.681 --> 44:43.503
Hello, in there.

44:44.369 --> 44:46.638
l come in peace.

45:06.354 --> 45:08.591
Anybody home?

45:19.123 --> 45:21.873
Don't be afraid. l'm a friend.

45:28.627 --> 45:30.536
Hello?

46:02.581 --> 46:05.330
(men speaking in Japanese)

46:07.093 --> 46:08.849
(yelling in Japanese)

46:08.917 --> 46:10.827
No, wait!

46:12.245 --> 46:14.385
Please.

46:14.454 --> 46:19.156
l come in peace. ln the name
of the Universe Society of Quebec.

46:19.222 --> 46:22.092
We're a friendly mission.
We wish you no harm.

46:22.166 --> 46:25.068
- Go on.
- Non.

46:25.142 --> 46:28.852
l must speak with you. lt's very important.

46:28.918 --> 46:33.043
lt's about the war with America.

46:33.848 --> 46:35.571
The war is over.

46:43.735 --> 46:45.645
Bernie?

46:47.415 --> 46:49.422
(insects buzz. he groans)

46:51.608 --> 46:56.310
Bulls and ducks, a cow, kids.
What'd l ever do to deserve this?

46:57.272 --> 46:58.319
Bernie?

46:59.224 --> 47:00.172
Mmm!

47:00.248 --> 47:02.157
- Mmm?
- Hmm-hmm!

47:05.688 --> 47:08.721
- Dozo.
- No, thank you, l can't eat another thing.

47:08.792 --> 47:11.160
- Thank you.
- You like?

47:11.225 --> 47:13.876
l like. Too much.

47:13.945 --> 47:19.313
You lucky. Today me cook.
Tomorrow Commander Hiro.

47:19.385 --> 47:21.108
Hiro! Hiro!

47:21.177 --> 47:23.087
Him not so good.

47:24.185 --> 47:26.094
(they laugh)

47:34.362 --> 47:36.271
(distant Japanese)

47:49.339 --> 47:52.187
- (soldier) Take that.
- (Bernadette) No, please, no more.

47:52.251 --> 47:55.928
- l've had enough.
- (the men laugh)

48:03.227 --> 48:06.872
(Hiro yells)

48:08.284 --> 48:10.194
Stop!

48:11.227 --> 48:14.839
Hiro, Cleveland, stop.
Mr. Dugan's a friend.

48:14.908 --> 48:17.210
(Cleveland speaks Japanese)

48:18.172 --> 48:21.238
- What's going on?
- Look what you've done.

48:21.308 --> 48:24.472
- You've ruined everything.
- l ruined...?

48:26.141 --> 48:28.180
You mean they weren't torturing you?

48:28.252 --> 48:31.286
l'm perfectly fine. Can't you see that?

48:31.357 --> 48:33.593
The war is over, Mr. Dugan.

48:36.061 --> 48:42.619
And now l would like to introduce,
from the lmperial Japanese Navy,

48:42.685 --> 48:44.857
Commander Hiro.

48:44.925 --> 48:46.867
Hiro.

48:46.942 --> 48:49.146
- And Lieutenant...
- Kurishima.

48:49.214 --> 48:51.221
Known as Cleveland.

48:51.293 --> 48:55.155
- Captain Dugan.
- (Cleveland speaks Japanese)

48:55.230 --> 49:01.144
- Cleveland?
- Mm. My mother visit America in 1 924.

49:01.214 --> 49:04.281
Her favorite city, Cleveland.

49:04.351 --> 49:06.772
Name me for that.

49:06.847 --> 49:09.880
Teach me first-class Eng-rish.

49:11.039 --> 49:12.828
Yes...

49:12.895 --> 49:20.052
They have been here for 35 years with
no contact with the world, not even a radio.

49:20.127 --> 49:25.179
But they know now we are going to be
very good friends. Aren't we?

49:26.048 --> 49:27.957
(speaks Japanese)

49:32.000 --> 49:34.236
(Cleveland) Yes. Friends.

49:34.303 --> 49:37.118
Now, everyone clasp hands.

49:39.392 --> 49:41.695
(Cleveland speaks Japanese)

49:43.873 --> 49:45.782
(Bernadette) Mr. Dugan.

49:52.961 --> 49:54.521
Friends.

49:54.593 --> 49:56.502
(Japanese)

50:00.289 --> 50:04.992
That's when they lost their comrades,
the radio.

50:07.041 --> 50:12.475
They spent years transporting
what they had left up to the hill.

50:13.473 --> 50:16.321
l mean, what courage.

50:16.385 --> 50:18.905
What perseverance.

50:20.419 --> 50:23.997
- You're very quiet, Mr. Dugan.
- l told you not to leave.

50:24.066 --> 50:29.816
That's it. Your pride's hurt.
l was dictated by a higher authority.

50:29.890 --> 50:31.646
Huh? Oh...

50:31.714 --> 50:34.976
Yeah, well, l was worried about you
and l thought you might need my help.

50:35.042 --> 50:37.279
l can take care of myself
just fine, thank you.

50:37.347 --> 50:39.552
You don't give an inch, do you?
What if they'd hurt you?

50:39.620 --> 50:41.213
- But they didn't.
- How was l to know?

50:41.284 --> 50:45.310
So you came charging in
like a bull in a china shop.

50:45.380 --> 50:47.867
Well, Mr. Dugan,
you, like the rest of the world,

50:47.939 --> 50:52.446
must learn that violence
is not the only solution to problems.

50:54.980 --> 50:57.217
Well, enough of that.
Let's get the food ready.

50:57.284 --> 50:59.772
You get it ready. l'm not hungry.

51:26.149 --> 51:28.059
l'm sorry.

51:30.246 --> 51:32.100
l said l was sorry.

51:34.405 --> 51:38.301
- You'll wake the children.
- Well, we can go outside.

52:00.872 --> 52:03.654
- Julie, come on.
- OK, l'm coming.

52:11.175 --> 52:14.242
- l don't want to fight any more.
- Neither do l.

52:14.312 --> 52:19.299
Look, l may do things differently than
what you like but l was trying to save you.

52:19.369 --> 52:23.045
- l know that now, Mr. Dugan.
- Would you please stop with this Mr. stuff?

52:23.112 --> 52:26.723
You only make me feel like my old man.
Dugan. Just Dugan. That's enough.

52:26.792 --> 52:28.319
Right, Dugan.

52:29.320 --> 52:35.104
Look, Bernie, l must've walked five miles
tonight trying to figure out what l'm feeling.

52:35.177 --> 52:39.334
What hit me is... l care about you.

52:51.018 --> 52:53.254
- l'm sorry.
- Shh.

52:54.730 --> 52:56.486
- Good night.
- Good night.

52:57.290 --> 53:00.421
- (Bobby) Look out.
- 'Night, kids.

53:05.482 --> 53:09.956
- How can she like him?
- Well, he's kinda cute.

53:10.027 --> 53:11.936
Cute?

53:12.011 --> 53:14.662
Well, you know, Bobby, he's really funny.

53:14.731 --> 53:17.481
He reminds me of Petey
when l first got him,

53:17.547 --> 53:22.336
always squawking and trying to peck
people, but he didn't mean it.

53:24.043 --> 53:26.345
l'm right about him. You'll see.

53:26.411 --> 53:28.419
Pull!

53:29.932 --> 53:31.787
- We won't make it, Dugan.
- We'll make it.

53:31.852 --> 53:33.924
These extra fuel tanks
are made out of rubber.

53:33.996 --> 53:37.542
We can make a raft out of them
and we can float off this mud pile.

53:37.612 --> 53:39.270
- lt'll never work.
- Why not?

53:39.340 --> 53:42.788
All you did as a pilot was get us
crashed on a desert island.

53:42.860 --> 53:44.769
So how come you think
you can be a sea pilot?

53:44.844 --> 53:49.384
Robert, the fact that we were off course
was not Mr. Dugan's fault.

53:49.453 --> 53:52.235
Kid, when your muscles are as big
as your mouth you'll be a real help,

53:52.300 --> 53:54.243
so shut up and pull.

53:54.316 --> 53:56.139
Come on, pull.

53:58.860 --> 54:01.348
- (they speak Japanese)
- Pull!

54:04.365 --> 54:06.276
Make raft.

54:07.309 --> 54:09.546
Sail away.

54:09.614 --> 54:12.297
Go home. Be happy.

54:13.230 --> 54:17.703
(they speak Japanese)

54:34.094 --> 54:36.266
Raft idea, no good.

54:36.335 --> 54:38.636
On ocean, you die quick.

54:38.703 --> 54:41.801
Well, if you've got a better idea, let's hear it.

54:41.870 --> 54:45.646
(he speaks Japanese)

54:52.783 --> 54:55.500
(they speak Japanese)

55:09.777 --> 55:12.395
Commander, number one officer.

55:12.465 --> 55:15.694
Him idea, number one.

55:15.761 --> 55:18.696
No make raft. Make boat.

55:18.768 --> 55:21.737
- Make a boat out of what?
- Out of prane.

55:21.810 --> 55:25.192
- Prane?
- l have problem with Rs.

55:25.265 --> 55:27.883
You'll have a lot more trouble
making a boat out of that plane.

55:27.953 --> 55:31.499
But prane already is boat.
Just wrong side up.

55:31.570 --> 55:35.847
- What?
- (they speak Japanese)

55:35.922 --> 55:39.304
You see, turn prane over. What you got?

55:40.786 --> 55:43.656
- An upside-down plane.
- No!

55:43.730 --> 55:45.323
You got boat.

55:45.394 --> 55:47.304
Look see. Look see.

55:47.634 --> 55:51.278
Tail become a rudder.

55:52.146 --> 55:53.575
Rudder, huh?

55:54.193 --> 55:58.285
And wings inside empty. Float good.

55:58.354 --> 56:01.137
- Better than raft.
- Better than raft, huh?

56:01.203 --> 56:04.552
Make big sail. Have good power.

56:04.627 --> 56:06.602
You'll still have
one wing bigger than the other.

56:06.674 --> 56:08.463
That's gonna put you off balance.

56:08.531 --> 56:11.498
Then the engines are gonna pull you down
in the water. No, l don't think so.

56:11.570 --> 56:14.058
Oh, easy fix. No problem.

56:14.131 --> 56:16.040
You like idea?

56:18.099 --> 56:21.198
- l guess you think it's a great idea, huh?
- Yeah, l like it.

56:21.267 --> 56:24.650
Well, l don't. l'm not so sure
l want anyone chopping up my plane.

56:24.724 --> 56:27.953
Oh, believe me, it no fly again.

56:28.020 --> 56:30.922
You want stay here
until someone find you?

56:30.996 --> 56:37.161
- Well, a couple of days, a few weeks.
- How about... 35 years?

56:46.677 --> 56:48.848
That's great. l'm proud of you.

56:48.916 --> 56:53.259
- (Hiro laughs)
- l'm really proud. That's pretty great.

56:58.646 --> 57:00.980
Why didn't l think of this?

57:02.294 --> 57:03.603
Huh?

57:03.669 --> 57:06.386
(Cleveland) Pull! Pull! Everybody pull!

57:20.823 --> 57:21.870
OK!

57:29.207 --> 57:31.116
(they yell)

57:33.720 --> 57:35.924
lt's going.

57:37.527 --> 57:41.237
Hey, those guys really know
what they're doing.

58:04.920 --> 58:07.604
(they argue in Japanese)

58:38.618 --> 58:42.360
We're ready now. Turn over.

59:35.229 --> 59:37.139
(motor)

59:38.877 --> 59:40.568
OK?

59:40.637 --> 59:42.547
(speaks Japanese)

01:00:49.632 --> 01:00:51.542
(they speak Japanese)

01:00:58.945 --> 01:01:00.854
Oh...

01:01:02.082 --> 01:01:06.337
l need a very large piece
to put in the center.

01:01:07.714 --> 01:01:09.624
(speaks Japanese)

01:01:22.851 --> 01:01:24.760
(speaks Japanese)

01:01:28.738 --> 01:01:30.648
(speaks Japanese)

01:01:34.242 --> 01:01:39.261
Our flag strong. Make good sail. You use.

01:01:39.332 --> 01:01:42.398
Thank you. Very much.

01:01:43.236 --> 01:01:46.051
l'll put it at the top of the sail.

01:01:46.116 --> 01:01:48.571
A place of honor.

01:01:49.603 --> 01:01:51.513
(speaks Japanese)

01:02:08.772 --> 01:02:11.772
- What you doing?
- Getting the animals on board.

01:02:11.844 --> 01:02:13.568
The animals can't come.

01:02:18.213 --> 01:02:19.326
What?

01:02:19.398 --> 01:02:23.740
Well, it's dangerous enough without them.
We gotta save ourselves.

01:02:23.813 --> 01:02:25.820
You mean
you're just gonna leave them here?

01:02:25.893 --> 01:02:29.538
Well, they're only animals.
They'll be fine.

01:02:30.853 --> 01:02:33.309
- Look, l know you like them.
- l love them.

01:02:33.381 --> 01:02:35.389
They trust us to take care of them.

01:02:35.462 --> 01:02:38.146
- Yeah, l understand...
- (Bobby) You don't understand.

01:02:38.214 --> 01:02:41.313
You don't know about loving them
because you don't even like them.

01:02:41.383 --> 01:02:44.994
Julie told me you were just teasing
about Brutus but you really meant it.

01:02:45.063 --> 01:02:47.451
- This proves it.
- Now, wait a minute.

01:02:47.526 --> 01:02:51.716
You be quiet. You got stuck with all of us
and now you want to get rid of us.

01:02:51.783 --> 01:02:55.079
Julie told me you were really nice
underneath and you just talk grouchy,

01:02:55.143 --> 01:02:58.591
and she said she was
gonna still love you anyway.

01:03:01.896 --> 01:03:03.073
Well...

01:03:03.143 --> 01:03:07.616
- Look, Julie, you have to understand...
- You still think he's so great, after all?

01:03:07.687 --> 01:03:11.299
He's gonna leave the animals here to die.
Do you?

01:03:23.881 --> 01:03:25.790
Julie...

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:30.311
lf we're gonna take the animals with us,

01:03:30.376 --> 01:03:34.054
we'd better make them
comfortable beds to sleep in. OK?

01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:38.110
OK.

01:03:38.186 --> 01:03:40.128
l love you, Mr. Dugan.

01:03:41.353 --> 01:03:43.263
Bobby! Bobby!

01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:48.225
Bobby, the animals
can come on the plane with us.

01:03:48.297 --> 01:03:50.402
Bobby?

01:03:54.986 --> 01:03:56.263
What's this?

01:03:57.866 --> 01:04:01.249
- Do you like it?
- Well, l hate the name Noah.

01:04:01.323 --> 01:04:02.599
Oh...

01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:05.033
l'm sorry. l didn't know.

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:09.734
No, wait a second. lt could be worse.

01:04:09.802 --> 01:04:12.673
- l guess we could leave it.
- Yes?

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:14.657
Yeah.

01:04:33.932 --> 01:04:35.841
(inaudible)

01:04:52.301 --> 01:04:53.195
Bernie! Bernie!

01:04:53.293 --> 01:04:55.202
Any sign of them?

01:04:55.949 --> 01:04:59.397
- Have you seen them? Where are they?
- l don't know.

01:04:59.469 --> 01:05:02.764
lt's almost high tide. lf they don't get her
soon, we've blown a whole day.

01:05:02.829 --> 01:05:04.585
- Are the supplies loaded?
- All loaded.

01:05:04.653 --> 01:05:09.225
Well, we gotta go now.
Bobby, are the animals secure?

01:05:09.294 --> 01:05:10.722
They're OK.

01:05:11.854 --> 01:05:14.789
lf that plane sinks because of those
animals, l'm gonna cut my throat.

01:05:14.862 --> 01:05:16.684
- Get ready.
- We can't leave without them.

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.433
lt's OK, they'll swim out after us.

01:05:59.696 --> 01:06:01.605
(shouted Japanese)

01:06:03.663 --> 01:06:05.355
Yes, wait for us!

01:06:05.425 --> 01:06:08.589
- You wait! Wait! Wait!
- Come on.

01:06:08.657 --> 01:06:12.235
- OK, we're coming, we're coming. Wait.
- Come on!

01:06:12.304 --> 01:06:14.214
(Cleveland) OK, wait!

01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:38.988
- What kept you guys?
- We take care of business. Hurry.

01:06:39.058 --> 01:06:41.677
But l thought you told me
high tide was at 1 1 .00.

01:06:41.747 --> 01:06:44.911
Yes, 1 1 . Hurry, hurry.

01:06:44.979 --> 01:06:46.954
Of course. 1 1 .

01:06:47.507 --> 01:06:51.663
Please, you hurry, hurry. Get plane to sea.

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:53.738
Well, OK, OK, but you're the one...

01:06:53.811 --> 01:06:55.720
(explosion)

01:07:13.299 --> 01:07:16.333
- l don't believe it.
- Orders.

01:07:16.404 --> 01:07:19.306
Leave island, leave nothing.

01:07:19.381 --> 01:07:25.261
Well, what if we're not ready? lf the plane
breaks up, if we gotta go back for repairs?

01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:28.715
All of your equipment, nothing left?

01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:32.651
- Commander Hiro very efficient.
- Hiro.

01:07:32.725 --> 01:07:34.318
Nothing.

01:07:36.084 --> 01:07:41.836
Well, everybody, you know what
you have to do. Take up your positions.

01:07:43.638 --> 01:07:48.656
<i> lf l were a star</i>

01:07:48.725 --> 01:07:51.791
<i> A tiny star</i>

01:07:51.861 --> 01:07:56.651
<i> You'd be my starlight</i>

01:07:56.726 --> 01:08:00.687
<i> Half of me is me</i>

01:08:01.783 --> 01:08:08.242
<i> The other half of me is you</i>

01:08:09.302 --> 01:08:14.420
<i> lf l were a bird</i>

01:08:14.486 --> 01:08:17.520
<i> A tiny bird</i>

01:08:17.591 --> 01:08:20.723
<i> You'd be my wings</i>

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:27.153
<i> For only half of me is me</i>

01:08:27.223 --> 01:08:34.130
<i> The other half of me is you...</i>

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:40.270
Good work, you guys.

01:08:50.424 --> 01:08:52.912
Well, Bernie, next stop, Hawaii.

01:08:52.984 --> 01:08:54.894
God willing.

01:09:00.984 --> 01:09:05.841
<i> lf l were a tree</i>

01:09:05.913 --> 01:09:09.045
<i> You'd be my roots</i>

01:09:09.113 --> 01:09:12.495
<i> We'd grow together</i>

01:09:13.689 --> 01:09:18.709
<i> Half of me is me</i>

01:09:18.778 --> 01:09:27.540
<i> The other half is you</i>

01:10:09.276 --> 01:10:10.936
- Dugan.
- What is it?

01:10:11.005 --> 01:10:13.208
l'm sorry, l had to wake you. lt's important.

01:10:13.277 --> 01:10:17.073
l was reading the Bible and l got
an idea about sending a message.

01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:19.124
Oh, is there a chapter on radio repair?

01:10:19.197 --> 01:10:20.920
Genesis 8:8.

01:10:20.989 --> 01:10:23.804
And Noah sent forth a dove from him

01:10:23.869 --> 01:10:27.218
to see if the waters were abated
off the face of the ground.

01:10:27.293 --> 01:10:30.643
Only one thing, Bernie.
We don't have a dove.

01:10:30.718 --> 01:10:33.019
We're counting on you
to deliver this message, Petey.

01:10:33.086 --> 01:10:37.276
So keep heading that way
until you get there. Got it?

01:10:37.342 --> 01:10:40.157
(shouted Japanese)

01:10:49.247 --> 01:10:51.157
Be careful, Petey.

01:10:53.183 --> 01:10:56.445
- ls he gonna make it?
- lf he does, he'd better speak Chinese.

01:10:56.511 --> 01:10:58.421
Hawaii's the other way.

01:11:03.839 --> 01:11:07.582
Maybe lucky tomorrow. Catch fish.

01:11:07.647 --> 01:11:10.943
Oh, yeah, we could use some.

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:14.261
Julie.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.240
Dear Lord,
thank you for what we are about to eat

01:11:21.312 --> 01:11:23.995
and let us be truly thankful.

01:11:26.752 --> 01:11:30.495
And if you have an extra minute,
give Petey a little push towards Hawaii.

01:11:31.105 --> 01:11:33.014
Please.

01:11:57.442 --> 01:12:00.409
Good girl, Melinda, you're doing just fine.

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:03.898
Here, Brutus. Here. Here.

01:12:04.515 --> 01:12:08.312
Brutus, you have to try and eat something
or you'll starve.

01:12:08.386 --> 01:12:11.386
Good thing you're not seasick, Melinda.

01:12:11.459 --> 01:12:14.045
Any eggs in the chicken coops, Bobby?

01:12:14.115 --> 01:12:16.351
l'm going to check now.

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.192
Still no luck, huh?

01:12:24.259 --> 01:12:27.259
Yes, no fish.

01:12:27.331 --> 01:12:29.665
Well, maybe you're using
the wrong kind of bait.

01:12:29.732 --> 01:12:31.641
(speaks Japanese)

01:12:34.436 --> 01:12:36.345
(Hiro speaks Japanese)

01:12:38.595 --> 01:12:43.036
Commander Hiro say,
something wrong, not our fault.

01:12:49.285 --> 01:12:53.376
- l got five, Julie.
- (sighs) Well, that's better than four.

01:12:53.445 --> 01:12:56.128
l'll take them to the kitchen.

01:13:14.437 --> 01:13:17.601
Hey, Brutus, try this.
lt's real good for you.

01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:22.307
- Hey, what do you think you're doing?
- l'm trying to make Brutus better.

01:13:22.374 --> 01:13:24.382
Not any more you're not.

01:13:24.454 --> 01:13:27.422
That's our food supply
and l won't have you throwing it away.

01:13:27.495 --> 01:13:29.218
- lt's only a little bit.
- Look, kid.

01:13:29.286 --> 01:13:33.148
Our rations aren't gonna last forever
so let's get one thing straight.

01:13:33.222 --> 01:13:36.353
Animals get animal food, not people food.

01:13:45.831 --> 01:13:48.963
You dish that out. l'll take care of this.

01:13:50.823 --> 01:13:52.514
Oh...

01:13:52.583 --> 01:13:55.201
Share this with Hiro and Cleveland.

01:13:55.271 --> 01:13:57.182
- OK. Thank you.
- OK?

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.404
- For you, sir.
- ls this mine?

01:14:02.473 --> 01:14:05.124
- Yes.
- l can do whatever l want with it, right?

01:14:05.193 --> 01:14:08.095
- Oh, yes.
- Then l'm gonna give it to Brutus.

01:14:08.168 --> 01:14:11.235
Now l know why he likes animals.
He's as stubborn as a mule.

01:14:11.305 --> 01:14:14.239
Mules aren't stubborn.
lt's just that some people are too dumb

01:14:14.312 --> 01:14:16.996
to get 'em to do
what they want 'em to do.

01:14:17.066 --> 01:14:20.775
- He doesn't mean to be rude.
- Don't give me any of that orphan boy flak.

01:14:20.841 --> 01:14:22.751
He'll make out OK. l did.

01:14:35.914 --> 01:14:41.927
l'm sorry, Miss Lafleur. We checked
every coop. There aren't any eggs.

01:14:44.298 --> 01:14:47.714
All right, Bobby. Thank you.

01:14:54.539 --> 01:14:57.289
Well, if our friends
don't come up with some fish soon,

01:14:57.355 --> 01:14:59.940
we're down to emergency rations.

01:15:00.715 --> 01:15:02.788
The hens aren't laying any more.

01:15:02.859 --> 01:15:04.964
Melinda, she doesn't want
to give any more milk.

01:15:05.035 --> 01:15:07.686
Yeah, l know. And l'm sick of rice.

01:15:07.756 --> 01:15:09.698
Well,
if the chickens aren't laying any more.

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:12.904
- Yes, that's what l had on my mind.
- No.

01:15:12.972 --> 01:15:17.128
Bobby, l know how you feel
but l'm afraid we're gonna have to.

01:15:17.196 --> 01:15:20.360
We wouldn't have to if Hiro and Cleveland
knew how to catch fish.

01:15:20.428 --> 01:15:24.357
The Japanese invented fishing, kid.
lf they can't catch them, nobody can.

01:15:24.428 --> 01:15:26.184
- l bet l can.
- Sure...

01:15:26.252 --> 01:15:28.673
Sure. What are you gonna do,
talk them into taking the bait?

01:15:28.748 --> 01:15:32.710
Now, you look. Me and Frankie used to
catch a lot of fish back at the orphanage.

01:15:32.781 --> 01:15:34.690
l'm not in the mood
for a kid story right now.

01:15:34.765 --> 01:15:37.285
l may be a kid
but that doesn't mean l'm stupid.

01:15:37.357 --> 01:15:39.561
Bobby, that's enough.
Captain Dugan just can't...

01:15:39.629 --> 01:15:42.182
Bernie, he's right.

01:15:43.085 --> 01:15:44.678
Let's hear him out.

01:15:45.645 --> 01:15:49.355
Well, you see, there was a stream
where we used to catch catfish.

01:15:49.421 --> 01:15:53.994
You see, what we'd do is hang a lantern
over the side of our rowboat at night.

01:15:54.062 --> 01:15:57.510
And then, you see, the fish would swim up
to the lantern to see what it was.

01:15:57.582 --> 01:16:00.930
So, why couldn't we
fix up some kind of light here?

01:16:01.006 --> 01:16:03.210
Bobby, you're a genius.

01:16:03.278 --> 01:16:07.173
We've got the biggest lanterns you could
want. Come on, kid, let's go fishing.

01:16:08.014 --> 01:16:09.924
(motor)

01:16:17.071 --> 01:16:18.413
OK!

01:16:19.087 --> 01:16:21.542
- OK!
- OK!

01:16:25.327 --> 01:16:27.783
- OK.
- Right.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.913
Not bad, eh?

01:16:43.984 --> 01:16:46.089
Very nice, nice.

01:16:49.233 --> 01:16:54.153
- Look, Miss Lafleur.
- l know. lt's like our private aquarium.

01:16:54.224 --> 01:16:58.250
Come. Let's tell the others to start fishing.
There's a lot.

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.997
- Can't l stay and watch?
- You can watch later. Come on.

01:17:02.064 --> 01:17:05.065
- The more lines out, the better.
- All right.

01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:16.359
(she hums Frére Jacques)

01:17:32.178 --> 01:17:33.739
(stops humming)

01:17:37.011 --> 01:17:38.920
(she screams)

01:17:43.572 --> 01:17:44.881
Julie?

01:17:44.948 --> 01:17:46.857
Julie?

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.976
Julie!

01:17:49.811 --> 01:17:52.146
Take it easy, Julie. What's the matter?

01:17:52.212 --> 01:17:55.954
Out there. l saw a shark.

01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:58.986
- Why, Julie, it's all right.
- He came at me.

01:17:59.059 --> 01:18:01.777
Yes, yes, but it's all right now. OK, OK.

01:18:01.844 --> 01:18:05.259
Commander say, shark reason no fish.

01:18:05.332 --> 01:18:07.056
Then we gotta get rid of the shark.

01:18:07.125 --> 01:18:11.697
- Ah, dangerous at night.
- Well, it's now or no more fish.

01:18:11.765 --> 01:18:13.521
- Are you with me?
- l'm with you.

01:18:13.589 --> 01:18:15.498
(speaks Japanese)

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.053
OK.

01:18:19.124 --> 01:18:20.652
OK, we catch.

01:18:22.517 --> 01:18:24.427
(speaks Japanese)

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:38.541
That's all we have left.

01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:41.713
Well, we can't help it, Bernie.
We gotta use it.

01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:45.557
Cast thy bread upon the waters
for thou shalt find it after many days.

01:18:45.623 --> 01:18:47.565
- Dugan.
- Ecclesiastes.

01:18:47.638 --> 01:18:50.027
Stick around, Bernadette,
l'm full of surprises.

01:18:50.102 --> 01:18:52.012
Tell the kids to stay below,
it could get rough.

01:18:52.087 --> 01:18:55.218
- All right.
- (speaks Japanese)

01:18:55.287 --> 01:18:58.517
- Put it in.
- (speaks Japanese)

01:19:10.295 --> 01:19:12.204
Shark! Shark!

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.907
Come on! Come on! Get the rope!

01:19:39.417 --> 01:19:42.451
(they speak Japanese)

01:19:47.641 --> 01:19:49.616
(Dugan) Hold on. Tie it down.

01:19:51.097 --> 01:19:53.967
Hold on. Hold on.

01:19:55.867 --> 01:19:59.215
Be careful. Just hold on. Keep holding.

01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:05.264
(Dugan) Hold on.

01:20:06.746 --> 01:20:11.831
Just keep holding on with all your might.
Keep pulling on it. Pull!

01:20:16.731 --> 01:20:22.744
- What happened? l thought you had him.
- Hey, you, get off of there, just get off!

01:20:26.395 --> 01:20:28.217
Bobby!

01:20:29.372 --> 01:20:32.503
- Mr. Dugan!
- No, Dugan! No, no! No, Dugan!

01:20:32.571 --> 01:20:35.190
- (Cleveland) No, don't jump.
- (Bobby) Mr. Dugan!

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:37.464
(Cleveland) Come back, Dugan!

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:41.722
- (splutters)
- Don't worry. Come on. Let's get out.

01:20:41.788 --> 01:20:43.698
Please, God, help him.

01:20:51.773 --> 01:20:53.660
The shark! The shark, Dugan!

01:20:56.285 --> 01:20:58.707
Dugan, come back! Hurry! Hurry!

01:21:16.958 --> 01:21:19.260
Come on, Dugan! Hurry! Hurry!

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:23.641
Hurry! Come on, come on, Dugan! Hurry!

01:21:49.632 --> 01:21:51.355
(Julie) Bobby! Bobby!

01:21:51.968 --> 01:21:53.146
You OK?

01:21:59.072 --> 01:22:02.519
l... l was wrong about you, Mr. Dugan.

01:22:02.592 --> 01:22:05.243
- l'm sorry.
- You're sorry, huh?

01:22:05.312 --> 01:22:09.372
When the hell are you gonna get it through
that skull of yours to do what you're told?

01:22:09.441 --> 01:22:13.881
You nearly got yourself killed.
You nearly got me killed.

01:22:14.913 --> 01:22:18.557
Cleveland, take him downstairs
and get him changed.

01:22:18.624 --> 01:22:20.861
Right, OK. Here we go.

01:22:27.617 --> 01:22:30.006
That was a very good shot.

01:22:36.322 --> 01:22:38.110
Drink, drink.

01:22:38.177 --> 01:22:40.087
ls hot.

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:43.902
ls good for you.

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:50.588
Julie. Cleveland.

01:22:50.658 --> 01:22:53.113
Could you leave us alone
just for a minute, please?

01:22:53.186 --> 01:22:55.096
(speaks Japanese)

01:23:02.626 --> 01:23:04.634
Well, how are you feeling?

01:23:05.411 --> 01:23:07.321
l'm OK.

01:23:10.723 --> 01:23:13.145
l'm sorry
l had to come down on you so hard.

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.347
But you were right.
lt was a dumb thing to do.

01:23:17.412 --> 01:23:19.484
l won't ever do anything like it again.

01:23:19.555 --> 01:23:23.550
Well, everybody does a dumb thing
every once in a while.

01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:25.530
Friends?

01:23:30.276 --> 01:23:32.186
Friends.

01:23:47.494 --> 01:23:50.177
Well, we're on our way again.

01:23:52.453 --> 01:23:55.203
What's the matter?

01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:57.987
Come on, what's up?

01:23:58.054 --> 01:24:01.852
lt's funny. We're floating around
in the middle of nowhere

01:24:01.926 --> 01:24:05.342
and this morning it hit me, it's all my faul

01:24:05.414 --> 01:24:08.349
- Oh, Bernie!
- lt's my fault.

01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:13.827
l dream up this idea
of making farmers out of Makuaranas.

01:24:13.894 --> 01:24:18.466
l bet they're quite happy as they are.
l force my society into letting me go.

01:24:18.534 --> 01:24:21.121
l convince you and Stoney
to fly me in a plane

01:24:21.192 --> 01:24:23.101
that no sensible person should get into.

01:24:23.175 --> 01:24:26.917
l put a spell on the compass. lf it weren't
for me, those children wouldn't be here.

01:24:26.983 --> 01:24:29.220
What have l been doing?

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.516
Listen, Bernie, you kept those kids going
when they had no reason to.

01:24:35.592 --> 01:24:37.796
You kept me going, too.

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:40.512
- Are we gonna make it?
- You bet we are.

01:24:40.584 --> 01:24:44.414
Petey's out there right now, flying his little
heart out. lf he hasn't already reached land.

01:24:44.489 --> 01:24:47.969
And l'm sure they sent word
when we didn't get to your island.

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.691
Planes are probably
looking for us right now.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:55.549
And we're not far from shipping lanes.
A freighter could come.

01:24:59.337 --> 01:25:01.443
l love you.

01:25:01.514 --> 01:25:03.423
l love you too.

01:25:41.003 --> 01:25:43.010
Big wind.

01:25:43.083 --> 01:25:46.214
- We'd better take the sail in.
- Mm-hm.

01:25:46.891 --> 01:25:49.193
(speaks Japanese)

01:25:55.596 --> 01:25:58.378
Will it be a bad storm, Miss Lafleur?

01:25:59.532 --> 01:26:01.953
l'm afraid it will be, Julie.

01:26:31.917 --> 01:26:33.827
(speaks Japanese)

01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:46.275
(speaks Japanese)

01:27:10.384 --> 01:27:12.293
(clunking)

01:27:21.008 --> 01:27:22.764
(Brutus snorts)

01:27:25.168 --> 01:27:27.078
(speaks Japanese)

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.121
(crack)

01:27:37.841 --> 01:27:41.005
Hurry up. Come on, Hiro.

01:27:42.929 --> 01:27:44.838
Come on. Whoa.

01:28:19.283 --> 01:28:21.192
lt's over!

01:28:24.595 --> 01:28:26.189
We made it.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:28.169
We made it.

01:28:37.907 --> 01:28:42.315
For somebody past her prime, you are
just amazing, old lady, just amazing.

01:28:42.387 --> 01:28:44.493
lt'd take more than a storm to sink you.

01:28:44.564 --> 01:28:46.768
Dugan! Dugan!

01:28:46.836 --> 01:28:48.909
Oh, you come quickly.

01:28:48.981 --> 01:28:50.988
He fall down. Very bad.

01:28:51.061 --> 01:28:53.297
l think he dying.

01:28:56.565 --> 01:28:58.474
Easy, Brutus...

01:29:01.717 --> 01:29:06.125
(Brutus groans)

01:29:06.197 --> 01:29:09.329
He... He is gonna be OK.
lsn't he, Miss Lafleur?

01:29:10.262 --> 01:29:13.360
Bobby, he isn't.

01:29:14.966 --> 01:29:17.300
He is gonna be OK. You'll see.

01:29:17.942 --> 01:29:19.600
Mr. Dugan?

01:29:23.062 --> 01:29:26.161
He is gonna be OK. Please.

01:29:40.406 --> 01:29:41.422
No!

01:29:41.496 --> 01:29:45.522
lt has to be done, Bobby. You don't wanna
see Brutus go on suffering like this?

01:29:45.592 --> 01:29:48.243
No, stay back. Stay away from him.

01:29:52.279 --> 01:29:54.832
What would your dad want you to do now,
Bobby?

01:29:54.903 --> 01:29:59.060
l never knew my dad. He left me at
the orphanage and then he went away.

01:29:59.128 --> 01:30:01.398
They didn't care.

01:30:01.464 --> 01:30:05.293
Well, that was then and this is now and
there are people here who do care, Bobby.

01:30:05.368 --> 01:30:09.012
- Like who?
- All of us care. We care about Brutus too.

01:30:09.081 --> 01:30:11.863
Stay back! Stay away from him!

01:30:17.784 --> 01:30:18.767
No!

01:30:33.369 --> 01:30:35.027
No!

01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:36.504
(speaks Japanese)

01:30:39.162 --> 01:30:41.071
(speaks Japanese)

01:31:07.995 --> 01:31:09.905
Goodbye, Brutus.

01:31:17.948 --> 01:31:19.803
(ship's horn)

01:31:20.828 --> 01:31:22.421
Dugan...

01:31:25.884 --> 01:31:29.048
- (cheering)
- Now hear this. Now hear this.

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:31.702
All hands fore and aft.

01:31:31.772 --> 01:31:33.299
l don't believe it.

01:31:33.372 --> 01:31:35.380
Believe, Dugan. Believe.

01:31:38.909 --> 01:31:43.481
(man) Do you. Noah. take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife.

01:31:43.549 --> 01:31:45.404
to have and to hold... ?
