00:00.455 --> 00:02.222
Previously on Gilmore Girls...

00:02.223 --> 00:04.423
I didn't get the internship
at the New York Times.

00:04.458 --> 00:05.078
What?

00:05.113 --> 00:07.373
- We heard the song.
- It gave me goose bumps.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.881
The way you locked eyes with him.

00:09.916 --> 00:12.578
No, no, no. It's just karaoke.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.065
You know I got swept up
in the lyrics and the moment.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.227
It didn't mean anything.

00:17.127 --> 00:18.633
Rory Gilmore...

00:18.764 --> 00:20.228
...will you marry me?

00:20.263 --> 00:22.572
Lorelai Leigh Gilmore.

00:26.095 --> 00:27.448
Logan…

00:27.783 --> 00:28.881
I can't.

00:29.016 --> 00:30.432
Goodbye, Rory.

00:43.399 --> 00:44.426
I'm telling you, it's her.

00:44.427 --> 00:45.634
- Trust me, it's not.
- It is.

00:45.635 --> 00:47.943
Why would Christiane Amanpour
be hanging out at the Dragonfly?

00:47.944 --> 00:48.682
I don't know.

00:48.683 --> 00:49.941
- She wouldn't.
- She is.

00:49.942 --> 00:51.446
You went up to her and said hi,
and she said,

00:51.447 --> 00:53.123
"Hi, I'm Christiane Amanpour,
nice to meet you"?

00:53.124 --> 00:54.857
No, I didn't go up to her at all.

00:54.892 --> 00:56.380
I looked at here and saw that it was her,

00:56.381 --> 00:57.479
and I went to get you.

00:57.480 --> 00:59.201
So I could look at
a fake Christiane Amanpour?

00:59.236 --> 01:00.233
She's real.

01:00.268 --> 01:03.238
Yeah. Remember the time when
you thought saw Sandra Day O'Connor?

01:03.239 --> 01:05.212
Yeah well this is different and
I haven't had any cough syrup.

01:05.212 --> 01:06.577
I guarantee you it's not her.

01:06.578 --> 01:08.885
You doubt my ability
to recognize a glamorous,

01:08.886 --> 01:11.165
- international war correspondent?
- I guarantee you it's not her.

01:11.166 --> 01:12.725
Oh, my god, that's Christiane Amanpour!

01:12.726 --> 01:13.798
That's what I told you.

01:13.799 --> 01:15.546
I can't meet Christiane Amanpour in my pajamas.

01:15.747 --> 01:17.176
I tried to get you to change, you wouldn't change.

01:17.177 --> 01:18.359
Well how long has she been here?

01:18.360 --> 01:20.292
I don't know I just saw her eating breakfast

01:20.293 --> 01:21.313
and I went home and got you. Hey, Michel,

01:21.314 --> 01:23.531
Michel, how long has Christiane Amanpour been here?

01:23.832 --> 01:25.983
Ah she checked in late last night, room 7.

01:25.984 --> 01:28.072
She's staying here?
You didn't tell me?

01:28.073 --> 01:30.963
I wanted to avoid
yet another embarrassing incident.

01:30.964 --> 01:32.034
What are you talking about?

01:32.035 --> 01:35.610
You always embarrass yourself
when celebrities stay at the inn.

01:35.611 --> 01:36.467
I do not.

01:36.568 --> 01:39.605
Jane Pauley, Harry Belafonte, Marisa Tomei.

01:39.606 --> 01:40.492
He's right, you know?

01:40.493 --> 01:43.022
No, no, Marisa Tomei's mother's best friend

01:43.023 --> 01:44.474
is my hairdresser's cousin's roommate.

01:44.475 --> 01:45.658
That's just freaky.

01:45.693 --> 01:47.410
I'm just saying you
make them uncomfortable.

01:47.511 --> 01:48.981
I run an inn. These are my guests.

01:48.982 --> 01:50.673
What am I supposed to do -- ignore them?

01:50.674 --> 01:51.986
I think that might be best.

01:53.340 --> 01:55.089
I'm gonna go over and say hi
and see if she'll meet you.

01:55.090 --> 01:57.809
What? Okay.
Wait. Don't be funny.

02:01.347 --> 02:03.245
- Excuse me, Ms. Amanpour?
- yes.

02:03.246 --> 02:05.148
Hello, I'm Lorelai Gilmore.
I run the inn.

02:05.183 --> 02:06.620
Very nice to meet you. It's a lovely inn.

02:06.621 --> 02:07.544
Thank you so much.

02:07.545 --> 02:11.411
I'm sorry to bother you,
but my daughter is a huge fan of yours,

02:11.412 --> 02:12.230
she always has been.

02:12.231 --> 02:13.877
That's very nice to hear.
Thank you.

02:13.878 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, she just graduated
from Yale, actually,

02:16.001 --> 02:17.906
where she was the editor
of the Yale Daily News.

02:17.907 --> 02:18.561
That's great.

02:18.862 --> 02:21.247
Anyway... she'd love to meet you,
if that's okay.

02:21.248 --> 02:22.677
I'd love to. Is she here?

02:22.678 --> 02:24.448
Yes, she is. Rory, come here.

02:25.413 --> 02:28.891
Come on. Okay, here she is.

02:28.892 --> 02:31.087
This is Rory Gilmore.
Rory, meet Christiane Amanpour.

02:31.088 --> 02:33.065
Hi, Rory. How are you?
Nice to meet you.

02:33.066 --> 02:34.373
Nice to meet you, too.

02:34.374 --> 02:35.865
I'm sorry to meet you in my pajamas.

02:35.866 --> 02:37.628
I don't usually walk around town like this.

02:37.629 --> 02:38.153
That's okay.

02:38.656 --> 02:40.823
I just think you are so inspiring.

02:40.824 --> 02:42.829
Your reporting is so bold and moving and

02:42.830 --> 02:45.060
fascinating and I know
you've won nine Emmys,

02:45.061 --> 02:46.667
but I just don't think
that's enough not that you care

02:46.668 --> 02:49.906
about that kind of thing,
but I just want to say thank you.

02:50.007 --> 02:51.473
Thank you.
That's really nice of you.

02:51.474 --> 02:53.474
And your mother says
that you've graduated Yale,

02:53.475 --> 02:56.038
editor of the Yale Daily News --
that's not bad.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.994
Oh, thank you.
I want to pursue a career in journalism.

02:58.995 --> 03:02.475
That's good, is it print you want?
Television? CNN, maybe?

03:02.787 --> 03:05.190
Oh, I'd love to work for a major daily.

03:05.191 --> 03:06.301
Do you know which one?

03:06.602 --> 03:08.133
Any one that will take me.

03:08.232 --> 03:10.094
That's the spirit.
I mean you just get in there,

03:10.095 --> 03:12.024
do what you can,
show them what you've got,

03:12.025 --> 03:13.759
and the rest will take care of itself.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.347
That's my plan.

03:15.399 --> 03:16.908
Listen, I don't often do this,

03:16.909 --> 03:18.713
but I'm going to give you my card,

03:18.748 --> 03:20.412
and if you want to send me some stuff,

03:20.413 --> 03:22.960
I'll have a look at it
and you know stay in touch.

03:22.961 --> 03:24.177
-Seriously?
- Yes, yeah.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.846
- Thank you.
- That's my cab out there,

03:25.847 --> 03:27.821
so I'm gonna go now.
It was really nice to meet you.

03:27.822 --> 03:28.348
Nice to meet you.

03:28.349 --> 03:30.380
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Good luck. Take care.

03:30.381 --> 03:31.418
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

03:33.427 --> 03:36.349
I can't believe I just met
Christiane Amanpour in my pajamas.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.473
Well, I'm sure you made an impression.

03:42.336 --> 03:44.425
Subtitle by maglori

04:33.519 --> 04:36.486
All right after "Great Adventure"
the next Roller coaster

04:36.487 --> 04:40.023
could be here at Lake Compounds,
home of the "Boulder Dash".

04:40.024 --> 04:40.661
Love it.

04:40.662 --> 04:42.762
"The number one choice
of wooden roller coasters",

04:42.763 --> 04:45.284
according to
Mr. Arthur Levin of about.com.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.318
Oh, yes. The venerable Mr. Levin,
a legend in coast criticism.

04:48.419 --> 04:48.987
So you've heard of him.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.046
Well, of course.
What coast connoisseur hasn't?

04:51.081 --> 04:52.646
"Great airtime", he says.

04:52.682 --> 04:55.495
"Smooth ride, relentless speed
from start to finish".

04:55.496 --> 04:56.914
You can admit it if you're scared.

04:56.915 --> 04:58.737
What? I'm not scared, are you scared?

04:58.738 --> 05:01.345
No, I'm not scared,
but I'm not the one who screams.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.108
That happened once.

05:02.109 --> 05:03.670
Nearly busted my eardrums.

05:03.705 --> 05:04.884
You want to keep talking smack,

05:04.919 --> 05:06.843
or you want to tell me what comes
after the Boulder Dash?

05:06.878 --> 05:10.025
How about the "Cyclone" in Coney Island.

05:10.026 --> 05:12.411
And then we can head west
to the "Millennium Force" in Ohio,

05:12.412 --> 05:14.703
this calls it a "Giga Roller coaster".

05:14.704 --> 05:15.892
You know what I say?

05:15.900 --> 05:18.923
No hands, eyes open.
That's right, you heard me.

05:18.958 --> 05:21.300
- I'll believe it when I see it.
- Well, believe it.

05:21.335 --> 05:24.160
Okay, I am done.

05:24.195 --> 05:26.567
74 résumé's,
addressed and sealed.

05:26.568 --> 05:27.925
Not at all excessive.

05:27.926 --> 05:30.280
Well, I just wanted to make sure
I didn't leave a stone unturned.

05:30.281 --> 05:33.340
Yes rocks, pebbles, boulders...
they've all been turned.

05:33.341 --> 05:35.110
Well, I got it all done
before our big trip.

05:35.111 --> 05:37.766
Can you believe it?
Oh, man I have a lot of books.

05:38.067 --> 05:40.867
Hey, there is a cool "State-Fare"
coaster in Springfield,

05:40.868 --> 05:42.662
50-mile detour, worth it.

05:45.473 --> 05:46.473
The rocket.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.257
The rocket... 

05:48.941 --> 05:50.503
Have you talked to him?

05:50.717 --> 05:51.940
No.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.326
It comes in waves, you know.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.791
Big ones, really close together.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.115
Well the waves will get smaller, I promise.

06:00.116 --> 06:02.996
Just have to give it time you know.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.864
Have to feel sad and get through it.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.151
Believe me.
I'm letting myself feel plenty sad.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.080
Oh that's good.
I mean it's not good, you know,

06:09.081 --> 06:10.834
under the circumstances, it's good.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.239
I just can't imagine it feeling better.

06:13.306 --> 06:14.941
But it will someday, I promise.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.811
Yeah, do you feel better about Luke?

06:17.877 --> 06:23.583
Ah, yeah. I feel better
because I think we're done.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.545
What, maybe you guys
just need more time.

06:25.550 --> 06:27.888
More time, I've given him
all the time in the world.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.530
Every time I'm venerable
or I say something

06:30.631 --> 06:33.484
or do something like the song
he doesn't do anything.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.528
Well he's always been a little slow to respond.

06:36.629 --> 06:39.526
Yeah I don't want to make any more excuses you know.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.368
I just don't think he's over you.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.311
Well it doesn't matter, I'm over him.

06:43.312 --> 06:45.353
I need someone who can feel you know,

06:45.354 --> 06:48.068
show me how he feels. He can't do that.

06:48.668 --> 06:50.110
I guess that make sense.

06:50.476 --> 06:53.380
Anyway we're batter as
friends you know, don't you think.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.282
Like "Hey Luke can I get some coffee",

06:55.349 --> 06:57.083
you know friends like that.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.319
Like "Hey Luke can you make all the burgers

06:59.386 --> 07:01.688
for Rory's re-enactment graduation party?" you know.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.924
What re-enactment graduation party?

07:03.991 --> 07:06.426
It's just a graduation re-enactment party we're gonna have

07:06.493 --> 07:08.496
for all the people who couldn't go to your actual graduation.

07:08.597 --> 07:09.497
Re-enactment, how?

07:09.663 --> 07:12.766
All you have to do is throw on that cap and gown again,

07:12.832 --> 07:15.201
you know and go up on a little podium again, that someone is gonna build

07:15.268 --> 07:17.604
and listen to the high school band play "Pomp and Circumstance".

07:17.671 --> 07:18.338
Mom!

07:18.405 --> 07:20.140
What it's a party, it's gonna be fun!

07:20.206 --> 07:21.631
Ah, you own me.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.205
Okay I'll get you lots of cotton candy

07:23.206 --> 07:24.418
and I won't make fun of you when you scream.

07:24.419 --> 07:25.800
I'm not gonna scream.

07:25.850 --> 07:27.262
Once a screamer, always a screamer.

07:27.265 --> 07:29.327
- I was seven.
- Like that counts.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.053
All right, give me 300 hot dogs, 250 burgers.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.521
- How about brats?
- No brats.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.550
And enough buns, obviously, to go with all that.

07:36.551 --> 07:39.298
Buns got it, you know brats go over very big at outdoor parties.

07:39.299 --> 07:40.860
Yeah well I know the woman throwing the party,

07:40.927 --> 07:43.363
and she and her daughter are dogs-and-burgers people.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.799
Al right the party's Saturday, so I want delivery on Friday okay.

07:45.865 --> 07:47.757
No sweat. I'll give you half off brats.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.636
Somebody cancel a big order, Charlie?

07:49.703 --> 07:50.404
I tried to tell her,

07:50.470 --> 07:52.073
"Lady, nobody eats Bratwurst at a wedding."

07:52.140 --> 07:54.241
Right. I'll see you, man. Thanks.

07:56.302 --> 07:56.976
Hey Liz

07:57.211 --> 07:58.845
Oh, hey, chuck, how you doing?

07:58.846 --> 07:59.400
I'm good.

07:59.212 --> 08:03.893
There's your uncle Lukie! Say, "hi, uncle Lukie!"

08:03.894 --> 08:04.719
HI Doula,

08:04.751 --> 08:07.454
When she just stares like that, that's her way of saying hi.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.255
Works for me. How you doing, Liz?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.257
Oh pretty good. How about you?

08:11.324 --> 08:13.393
Oh, god, I'm crazed. You want something to eat?

08:13.460 --> 08:14.728
No, we just stopped by

08:14.794 --> 08:16.629
'cause Doula misses her uncle Lukie. She really misses him.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.400
Yeah look I cannot baby-sit today.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.535
Please! I just need a little break

08:22.602 --> 08:23.837
Come on I'm really swamped today al right.

08:23.903 --> 08:26.272
Besides, I'm really trying to lay in the stuff

08:26.339 --> 08:27.841
for Rory's party next week.

08:27.907 --> 08:30.744
Please I really want to get something special for that party,

08:30.811 --> 08:34.900
and every item of clothing that I own is covered in spit-up.

08:34.614 --> 08:35.715
Sorry

08:35.782 --> 08:37.683
Okay, if you can't do it, you can't do it.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.919
So arr, did you give it to her?

08:39.986 --> 08:41.187
What?

08:41.254 --> 08:43.155
The necklace -- did you give it to Lorelai yet?

08:43.222 --> 08:44.725
That was just a backup gift for Rory.

08:44.792 --> 08:48.461
Oh come on that was no backup gift. And what about the song?

08:49.028 --> 08:50.864
D..d.. f.. forget about the song. The song meant nothing.

08:50.930 --> 08:51.965
We're friends. That's it.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.134
Oh and you're good with being just friends.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.936
- Yeah.
- I don't buy it.

08:56.002 --> 08:57.738
Well then maybe you should give her the necklace then.

08:57.805 --> 08:58.873
I'm really busy here

08:59.139 --> 09:00.074
Fine, fine.

09:00.141 --> 09:03.310
Hey could you mix a sweet potato and a banana in a blender?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.745
It's Doula's favorite.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.614
Sure.  And don't slip out while I make it.

09:12.752 --> 09:14.788
I don't see why Rory had to take this meeting

09:14.854 --> 09:16.090
during our Friday night dinners.

09:16.091 --> 09:16.791
Emily..

09:16.856 --> 09:18.158
Well it's not even an interview.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.393
If it was an interview, I would understand,

09:20.460 --> 09:21.561
but it's a drink.

09:21.628 --> 09:22.662
It's a contact, mom.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.698
She's trying to remind him who she is.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.366
As if anyone could forget.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.195
I know. You know Rory wants to make sure

09:28.196 --> 09:30.203
she's got her bases covered before we go out of town

09:30.270 --> 09:31.871
so that she can relax and have fun.

09:32.038 --> 09:34.407
But I don't think this drink should eat into our time.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.709
Well maybe we'll stay later.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.077
For after-dinner drinks?

09:37.143 --> 09:37.978
Maybe.

09:39.144 --> 09:41.247
So, how long will you two be gone?

09:41.314 --> 09:42.616
Oh, a couple weeks, a month.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.684
You're riding roller coasters for a month?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.052
As long as our stomachs can take it.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.454
This is what Yale graduates do?

09:47.521 --> 09:49.356
Mother she's tired.
She needs a break.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.857
Plus, this might be my last shot

09:50.924 --> 09:52.726
You last shot, what are you talking about?

09:52.792 --> 09:55.132
Well, she's gonna get a job, and who knows where?

09:55.133 --> 09:56.233
You know, she's gonna move on.

09:56.235 --> 09:57.397
This might be the last time I

09:57.398 --> 09:59.047
I can really spend time with her like this.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.368
Honestly, Lorelai, must you be so maudlin?

10:01.434 --> 10:03.036
I'm not being maudlin. I'm being realistic.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.271
So, how are things at the inn?

10:05.538 --> 10:07.174
Oh, good. Busy, but good.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.608
I have an idea for you.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.276
- Oh, no.
- Hmm?

10:10.343 --> 10:12.479
Oh, no, don't stop there. Go on.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.781
I think you should add a spa to your inn.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.049
A spa?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.751
Yes, spas are exploding.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.052
Sounds dangerous.

10:19.119 --> 10:19.920
All of our friends

10:19.986 --> 10:22.422
are trading island vacations for spa holidays

10:22.489 --> 10:23.423
I don't know, mom.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.346
When I was the Ballantyne Resort, it got me thinking.

10:25.347 --> 10:28.061
This is really something I think you should do.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.630
Small country inns are old news, Lorelai.

10:30.697 --> 10:33.266
Destination spas are what everyone's talking about.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.801
Mom, I told you business is good.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.704
I don't need to rub people with rocks or wrap them in seaweed.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.372
Well, the travel market is fickle.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.307
It wouldn't hurt to stay ahead of the curve.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.143
I don't have the money for expansion
Ooh here she is,

10:44.544 --> 10:46.780
Will you at least think about it before you say no?

10:46.846 --> 10:48.181
Yes, I will think about it.

10:48.248 --> 10:48.949
- hi
- hi

10:48.950 --> 10:49.650
Hi, sorry I'm late.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.184
How were the drinks?

10:51.251 --> 10:53.453
Good, I got a job.

10:53.820 --> 10:54.921
- What tonight?
- Tonight?

10:54.988 --> 10:57.457
I leave in three days. I can't leave in three days.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.692
Whe…Wha…Leave where?

10:58.758 --> 11:00.093
What's the job, honey?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.429
Well, I was having drinks with Hugo Gray, right?

11:02.596 --> 11:04.264
Who's this Hugo Gray?

11:04.330 --> 11:06.666
He runs an online magazine. Rory's been writing for him.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.649
So we were just talking about different opportunities

11:08.650 --> 11:10.368
that might come up and where I've already applied,

11:10.369 --> 11:12.160
and he mentioned that the reporter

11:12.161 --> 11:14.274
that was covering the Barack Obama campaign for him

11:14.140 --> 11:17.037
dropped out because his fiancée
got a job in Dubai, so they're moving.

11:17.037 --> 11:17.899
- Wow..

11:17.978 --> 11:20.314
So Hugo asked me if that was something I'd be interested in

11:20.380 --> 11:21.935
and I said "yes I would be interested"

11:21.936 --> 11:23.480
and he told me more about it and

11:23.481 --> 11:25.210
apparently I would be on the campaign trail

11:25.485 --> 11:26.720
with the other reporters

11:26.786 --> 11:28.488
the planes, the buses, the whole deal.

11:28.755 --> 11:31.091
And I mean it's only an online magazine,

11:31.157 --> 11:33.626
so I wouldn't be staying where the
wall street journal people stay at night but…

11:33.693 --> 11:34.728
Who cares?

11:34.794 --> 11:35.996
But I would be traveling with them

11:36.063 --> 11:38.298
I'd be filing stories from the
road right up until the convention.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.367
So have you talked salary yet?

11:40.433 --> 11:41.801
Yeah, it's next to nothing

11:41.868 --> 11:44.337
but all my meals and travel and hotels would be covered,

11:44.404 --> 11:45.872
so I wouldn't have that many expenses.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.774
Well that's fine. You're just starting out.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.410
Plus, it sounds like you'll be making excellent contacts.

11:50.477 --> 11:51.845
I would be.

11:51.911 --> 11:53.178
It could be quite grueling, Rory

11:53.179 --> 11:55.828
all that constant travel, the seedy motels.

11:55.929 --> 11:57.050
She can handle it.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.852
I hope so. I said yes.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.120
That's great.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.388
It is, right?

12:01.454 --> 12:03.424
Ah you're gonna be working on a presidential campaign.

12:03.590 --> 12:07.260
I know but that also mean in three
days I'd be leaving for who knows how long.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.863
It could be two months, it could be two years if Barack does well.

12:09.929 --> 12:11.197
And what does that mean

12:11.264 --> 12:13.199
I'm only gonna come home on holidays? That's crazy.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.636
And I need some transition time, and the roller coasters -

12:15.703 --> 12:17.505
how am I gonna go on all the roller coasters

12:17.572 --> 12:20.707
if I have to leave and have to be in Iowa on Monday

12:20.774 --> 12:22.075
at the town hall meeting

12:22.142 --> 12:24.544
at the quality inn and suites ballroom in Sioux city?

12:24.611 --> 12:25.779
You're gonna be fine.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.015
What about the roller coasters?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.817
We'll do it another time.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.320
This is what you've been working for.

12:33.687 --> 12:36.289
Yeah. I guess it is.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.727
I would have credentials -- real press credentials.

12:40.794 --> 12:41.861
Isn't that crazy?

12:41.928 --> 12:43.463
It's not crazy.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.299
So, this is it

12:47.266 --> 12:49.002
This is the last time we'll see you

12:49.069 --> 12:50.404
for who knows how long.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.574
Oh, yeah, I guess it is.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.014
After-dinner drinks for sure.

13:02.516 --> 13:04.618
Hear, hear.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.319
But this list they gave me is just ridiculous.

13:09.490 --> 13:12.025
Where am I gonna find a laptop car adapter by tomorrow?

13:12.192 --> 13:13.761
24-hour laptop-car-adapter store.

13:13.827 --> 13:14.762
Seriously, mom.

13:14.828 --> 13:17.331
Well honey that's our mission today. We'll buy or borrow.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.932
Hey, Caesar, is Luke around?

13:19.076 --> 13:21.075
- Sure. How are we today, ladies?
- we're fine

13:21.067 --> 13:22.703
We'll be finer with a little coffee

13:22.769 --> 13:23.770
Two to go, please.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.530
With pleasure. Hey, Luke, you
got company. Here, let me take that.

13:26.531 --> 13:27.685
- I got it.
- Let me.
- I'm fine.

13:27.686 --> 13:28.408
It's not a problem.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.211
- It's becoming one. Take it. All right.
- Sorry.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.846
- Hey, hey Rory!
- Hi.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.594
Hi, what was all that about?

13:34.781 --> 13:36.716
Oh he's just trying to show me

13:36.783 --> 13:39.019
he can handle things, you know if I leave.

13:39.085 --> 13:39.620
If?

13:39.786 --> 13:41.755
Well t he boat trip's been cancelled,

13:41.822 --> 13:44.879
but Caesar's got it in his
head that I'm gonna leave at some point

13:44.880 --> 13:47.543
so he can prove he can -- whatever.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.196
Java one, java two.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.750
Thanks So, Luke... Remember all the burgers and

13:52.751 --> 13:55.902
hot dogs I ordered for
Rory's party a week from Saturday?

13:55.969 --> 13:57.203
I have to cancel them.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.972
- Why?
- Well the party's cancelled.

13:59.139 --> 14:02.609
Wait a second, did you just say
Rory's graduation party is cancelled?

14:02.676 --> 14:05.345
Oh ho, it's good news. Someone got a job.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.646
What job?

14:06.713 --> 14:08.215
I'm gonna be a reporter for an online magazine.

14:08.382 --> 14:10.217
Oh it's better than that -- she's going to Iowa,

14:10.284 --> 14:13.550
and she's gonna be on the
campaign bus with Barack Obama.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.024
- No party at all?
- Babette.

14:17.191 --> 14:19.859
Congratulations. That's great news.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.862
Thank you. Yeah I'm really excited, but I'm nervous.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.464
I have to be a real reporter, yikes.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.965
You'll be a great one.

14:26.032 --> 14:29.235
She will, so, sorry, but no Rory, no party.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.704
But you promised us a re-enactment.

14:30.771 --> 14:32.406
We can still do the re-enactment.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.474
Remember my suggestion -- Lulu plays Rory?

14:34.541 --> 14:37.409
It's not the same, Kirk. And I was so looking forward to

14:37.410 --> 14:39.345
having a good cry at the re-enactment..

14:39.812 --> 14:42.849
Uh, okay. You want a re-enactment?

14:42.916 --> 14:45.252
We can, we can give you one right, right now.

14:45.318 --> 14:48.922
Uh come on, Rory. Okay, so watch this.

14:50.657 --> 14:55.462
Okay, and, everybody,
the graduate, Lorelai Leigh Gilmore.

14:55.529 --> 14:57.985
Ooh. Ooh. Here you go. And shake the hand.

14:57.986 --> 14:58.486
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:58.486 --> 15:02.069
And you are one of tomorrow's future leaders today.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.303
I am so happy.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.972
I am so glad to have graduated Summa-cum-Luke.

15:06.039 --> 15:09.643
And then the thing.  Okay. Yay!

15:10.110 --> 15:12.379
That's not how I imagined it.

15:12.446 --> 15:14.850
I'm sorry, guys. I wish we could do the party.

15:14.851 --> 15:18.812
I really do. We just don't have
time. She's leaving in two days.

15:19.047 --> 15:22.132
-Two days?
- I know. It's really soon.

15:22.456 --> 15:23.824
We just have a lot to do.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.759
So this is goodbye?

15:25.826 --> 15:29.257
No this isn't goodbye, I'm gonna come
by tomorrow and visit everybody

15:28.395 --> 15:30.697
I'm not ready for this to be the real goodbye.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.632
Yeah this is more like a "see you later."

15:32.699 --> 15:34.301
Yeah, I'll see you guys later.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.203
Okay? So see you later.

15:38.169 --> 15:39.538
-Bye
-Bye

15:40.405 --> 15:46.930
Bye, dollfaces.  No party.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.787
Hey.

15:53.854 --> 15:55.122
Hey, Luke, how's it going?

15:55.188 --> 15:56.790
Good. It's going good. How are you?

15:56.857 --> 15:58.825
Ooh Good. Hey, I apologize for the smell in here,

15:58.892 --> 16:00.293
but I'm making bouillabaisse.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.028
It's kind of at the stinkiest part --

16:02.095 --> 16:03.663
a lot of uncooked fish and garlic.

16:03.730 --> 16:04.998
It smells good to me.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.034
Well you're very kind. You looking for Lorelai?

16:07.100 --> 16:08.301
'Cause she's out and about,

16:08.368 --> 16:09.871
and I don't know when she's coming back.

16:09.890 --> 16:11.905
Yeah, I know. I saw her in town.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.441
- oh. Yeah.
- Yeah. So, what's up?

16:14.508 --> 16:18.545
Well, you know she cancelled Rory's graduation party?

16:18.612 --> 16:21.548
Yeah. I mean I knew that kid
wouldn't last a whole summer at home

16:21.615 --> 16:23.750
before landing some kind of amazing job,

16:23.817 --> 16:25.423
but, god, it happened so lightning fast.

16:25.424 --> 16:28.488
You know I was thinking maybe we should throw it anyway.

16:28.555 --> 16:28.984
Oh, yeah?

16:28.985 --> 16:30.686
Yeah, I mean it's a week sooner than we planned,

16:30.687 --> 16:32.130
but there's no reason we can't do it.

16:32.131 --> 16:33.131
I guess not.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.352
And I think we should make it a surprise party.

16:35.353 --> 16:37.230
Who doesn't love a surprise?

16:37.297 --> 16:39.166
Yeah I got all the hot dogs and the hamburgers,

16:39.232 --> 16:41.168
and the buns are on their way today anyway.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.636
You know, that's a very sweet idea Luke.

16:42.703 --> 16:44.371
Yeah, I think Rory would really love it.

16:44.438 --> 16:45.739
I think Lorelai would love it.

16:45.806 --> 16:48.262
- Yeah, Rory and Lorelai.
- Yeah, Rory and Lorelai.

16:48.297 --> 16:49.276
I think we should do it!

16:49.342 --> 16:51.578
All right. I'll start telling everybody.

16:51.645 --> 16:52.846
Okay what do you need from me?

16:52.913 --> 16:53.847
Desserts.

16:53.914 --> 16:55.415
Aha! Well, I'm all over it.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.351
Give Jackson a call.: He'll help you with whatever you need.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.254
-Al right Okay, thanks, Sookie.
- Okay.
- All right, bye.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.194
I don't know, I think it would have made more sense

17:08.261 --> 17:10.873
to get a regular-sized
shampoo bottle instead of 20 tiny ones.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.200
With the big bottle you got to lug it off and on the bus.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.734
Lug! How big do they make them?

17:14.800 --> 17:17.871
Look the little bottles give you as
much shampoo without the weight.

17:17.938 --> 17:19.973
Perfect for travel -- plus, they're cute.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.675
Al right. Oh, I want to stop by the post office.

17:21.742 --> 17:23.410
I want to get tons of blank postcards.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.045
You are gonna get so many postcards.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.146
You could just e-mail me.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.348
Yeah but postcard-sending is a dying art form.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.484
Right, and it's nice to get mail.

17:29.485 --> 17:30.226
Sure.

17:30.261 --> 17:31.418
Plus, we'll talk all the time.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.120
Yeah. What else do you need?

17:33.186 --> 17:34.388
Um, a mini book light.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.023
Ah man I had a mini book light, but I lent it to Paris.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.359
And by "lent," I mean she totally stole it.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.094
I think we have a mini book light in the lost

17:41.161 --> 17:42.829
and found at the inn. It's been there like a month.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.542
Oh poor rejected book light.

17:44.543 --> 17:46.760
Maybe you should adopt it and give it the love it needs..

17:47.167 --> 17:48.335
All right. Check.

17:48.402 --> 17:52.360
What else do we need?
Ooh, hey, I have a great idea. Come here.

17:52.361 --> 17:53.361
What, where are we going?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.941
Remember last year when Miss Patty hurt her back

17:55.008 --> 17:56.743
during rehearsal for spring fling?

17:56.810 --> 17:58.945
Oh yeah she should have never demonstrated the Jetés

17:59.012 --> 18:00.180
for the little daffodils.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.756
She had one of those back-support things

18:01.757 --> 18:02.959
that you put on top of chairs.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.131
I bet she'd loan that to you.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.254
Yeah but do I really want to be
known as "back-support-thingy girl"?

18:07.255 --> 18:09.289
AH, hello, two-hour speech, metal folding chairs,

18:09.356 --> 18:11.191
and now I'll take questions for an hour.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.627
Just call me "back-support-thingy girl."

18:13.693 --> 18:15.050
That's weird. She never locks this.

18:15.051 --> 18:16.406
- Miss Patty?
- Miss Patty?

18:19.800 --> 18:22.836
- Oh, hello, girls.
- Hi, is everything okay?

18:22.903 --> 18:24.164
Oh, yes, everything is fine.

18:24.165 --> 18:25.936
I'M...consulting with my muse.

18:25.937 --> 18:26.955
Your muse?

18:26.956 --> 18:29.893
Yes! whenever I want to think up a new dance routine,

18:29.894 --> 18:32.384
I come in here alone, lie down on the floor in the dark,

18:32.385 --> 18:36.483
and I let the muse inspire me. Did you want something?

18:36.550 --> 18:38.719
That's okay, we'll come back
when you're not with your muse.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.174
- Okay, good.
- Okay, well, so we'll...

18:40.209 --> 18:43.625
- See you later.

18:43.660 --> 18:44.825
- Odd.
- Very odd.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.763
Okay, they're gone.

18:49.830 --> 18:50.907
Good. Let's get this meeting going.

18:52.456 --> 18:55.135
Once again, this is not a "meeting," per se.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.503
We have already broken several Robert's rules of order.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.816
So don't tell Robert.

18:58.817 --> 19:01.190
Yeah besides, isn't it worth breaking rules over?

19:01.191 --> 19:02.322
It is Rory, for god's sake.

19:02.323 --> 19:05.037
So lets start divvying up the
duties, who's gonna do the food?

19:05.019 --> 19:08.014
I got hot dogs and hamburgers
and a couple of big grills in the square,

19:08.081 --> 19:10.050
and Sookie's got the rest covered, right Jackson?

19:10.117 --> 19:11.585
She's at home baking right now.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.754
You name the fruit, it'll be in one of her pies.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.489
Can she make a sour-cream/peach pie?

19:15.555 --> 19:16.123
I'll put it on the list.

19:16.190 --> 19:17.024
I'd like a blackberry.

19:17.191 --> 19:18.960
Oh she makes a wicked blackberry and cranberry.

19:19.027 --> 19:22.396
What about cherry? Cherry is a classic.

19:24.131 --> 19:26.400
Please, could we stay focused?

19:26.466 --> 19:28.502
People, this gathering is unofficial,

19:28.568 --> 19:31.305
as such I would like to have
it over with as soon as possible.

19:34.141 --> 19:34.318
Now, Luke, I assume you have obtained permits to use

19:34.319 --> 19:36.833
two large grills with open flame on our town square?

19:37.310 --> 19:39.413
Uh, no, I don't, I don't have any permits.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.648
I just, I just started this whole thing a couple hours ago.

19:41.715 --> 19:46.153
Outdoor barbecuing sans permit is a violation of town codes.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.088
As selectman, I can't approve that.

19:48.155 --> 19:49.923
Hey Taylor If this meeting is unofficial,

19:49.990 --> 19:52.025
then whatever you say is unofficial,

19:52.092 --> 19:53.226
so Luke's barbecuing, what else.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.828
Music. There's got to be music.

19:54.895 --> 19:57.164
- Yeah, who's got a good sound system?
- Yo!

19:57.230 --> 19:59.599
I believe I can also be of some help in this area.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.069
I'd gladly donate my time and expertise as deejay.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.137
Did a little deejay work back in college.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.839
Went by the moniker "Captain K."

20:05.906 --> 20:07.741
He's really good at scratching.

20:07.808 --> 20:10.110
- Yeah we've all seen that.
- Okay what about decorations?

20:10.177 --> 20:12.946
I have a bunch of stuff left
from a school birthday party -

20:13.013 --> 20:14.381
Mylar balloons, streamers.

20:14.448 --> 20:16.717
There are not going to be any Mylar balloons.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.786
They are infamous for floating up and catching on power lines.

20:19.853 --> 20:21.788
It could cause an outage for the whole town.

20:21.855 --> 20:24.858
The closest power lines are six miles out of town.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.960
Nonetheless…

20:27.027 --> 20:29.463
Nonetheless, Lulu, why don't you bring those balloons

20:29.529 --> 20:30.864
and whatever else you got?

20:30.931 --> 20:34.234
You people are violating town ordinances left and right.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.702
This is highly irregular.

20:35.769 --> 20:38.305
Dude, you're who's highly irregular.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.241
Excuse me?

20:41.308 --> 20:42.909
I don't know what your problem is,

20:42.976 --> 20:44.778
but the town wants to throw this party,

20:44.845 --> 20:46.346
and you're either gonna join us

20:46.413 --> 20:48.482
or you're gonna stay home and comb your beard.

20:49.783 --> 20:50.884
Okay, all right,

20:50.951 --> 20:52.586
we're gonna need chairs and tables

20:52.652 --> 20:54.888
and volunteers to set them up around the gazebo.

20:54.955 --> 20:56.666
Okay we're all gonna get started in the square

20:56.667 --> 20:58.166
tonight after dark, okay?

20:59.559 --> 21:02.829
This will remain an unofficial party, you hear men, unofficial!

21:03.930 --> 21:05.130
You should come along. It would be fun.

21:05.267 --> 21:06.985
No you need some alone time with Lane.

21:06.986 --> 21:08.897
Yeah but it's cutting into our you-and-me time.

21:08.898 --> 21:09.898
That would seem like a long time, right?

21:10.205 --> 21:11.473
There's plenty of time.

21:11.639 --> 21:13.274
36 hours is not plenty of time.

21:13.341 --> 21:16.678
That's not true. Imagine if you had a 36-hour flight.

21:16.744 --> 21:18.546
- That would seem like a long time, right?
-Yeah.

21:18.613 --> 21:20.382
All right plus, I have to go to Sookie and Jackson's

21:20.449 --> 21:22.117
- to get you that fanny pack.
- Really?

21:22.183 --> 21:22.968
What "really"?

21:22.969 --> 21:24.874
You honestly think I'm gonna wear a fanny pack?

21:24.986 --> 21:27.381
All I know is, it's on the list, and if it's on the list,

21:27.382 --> 21:28.481
I'm getting it for you.

21:28.482 --> 21:30.024
You think Tom Brokaw's mother

21:30.091 --> 21:32.227
sent him off to his first campaign with no fanny pack?

21:32.294 --> 21:33.995
When, when in my right mind would I…

21:34.062 --> 21:36.097
Perhaps the senator might like a piece of gum,

21:36.164 --> 21:38.266
and no one has any, and then they say,

21:38.333 --> 21:41.136
"what about that girl with the lime-green fanny pack?"

21:41.202 --> 21:43.037
"Lime-green" I would be "Lime-green fanny pack girl."

21:43.104 --> 21:44.572
And they bring you over to him, and he says,

21:44.639 --> 21:46.474
"Hello young lady, what is your name?"

21:46.541 --> 21:48.576
"My name's Rory Gilmore. Here's your gum."

21:48.643 --> 21:50.311
And like that, you're gum buddies with

21:50.378 --> 21:52.647
the future president of the United States!

21:52.714 --> 21:54.649
Oh when you put it that way -- gum buddies.

21:54.716 --> 21:56.618
All right look, I'll meet you back at home, okay?

21:56.684 --> 21:58.520
Okay but take a nap, 'cause we're staying up really late.

21:58.586 --> 22:00.063
- I don't need a nap to stay up really late.
- Okay.

22:00.288 --> 22:01.589
Give my love to Lane and the boys.

22:01.590 --> 22:03.391
-I will. Bye.
- Bye.

22:05.726 --> 22:07.211
-Billy Fink.
- You did not!

22:07.212 --> 22:09.465
-  I did.
- But Dave Rogalski.

22:09.466 --> 22:11.166
Not technically my first kiss.

22:11.363 --> 22:12.600
How did I not know this?

22:12.867 --> 22:14.833
I was too ashamed to ever tell you.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.472
I mean how would you
feel if your first kiss was Billy Fink?

22:17.539 --> 22:19.808
Well just 'cause he didn't come out of the gates strong

22:19.874 --> 22:21.443
doesn't mean he didn't turn into a very handsome,

22:21.509 --> 22:22.763
dashing billionaire.

22:22.794 --> 22:24.779
He didn't, I ran into him a few years ago,

22:24.846 --> 22:27.349
and he's living with his mom and sells shoes in Norwich.

22:27.350 --> 22:29.684
Oh. Well, maybe he'll sell billions of shoes.

22:31.052 --> 22:32.754
How weird is this?

22:32.821 --> 22:34.789
Yesterday we're sitting on your porch playing jacks

22:34.856 --> 22:37.618
and praying to grow boobs, and now look at us.

22:38.059 --> 22:39.861
I have a husband and two babies in there,

22:39.928 --> 22:42.063
and you're about to go off and conquer the world,

22:42.130 --> 22:43.398
or at least write about it.

22:43.465 --> 22:45.233
We've come a long way, baby.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.585
- I'll say.
- Babe.
- Yeah.

22:47.586 --> 22:48.337
Can I talk to you a sec?

22:48.338 --> 22:49.338
- Sure what's up?
- In private.

22:49.904 --> 22:51.673
- Oh, well, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

22:51.740 --> 22:52.707
- Sorry, Rory.
- No problem.

22:55.259 --> 22:56.751
- The kids okay?
- Sound asleep.

22:56.978 --> 22:57.719
They what's going on?

22:57.779 --> 22:58.741
I just got a call from Luke,

22:58.776 --> 23:00.737
and they want to start setting up
the square for the party tomorrow.

23:00.738 --> 23:01.561
Yeah so?

23:01.562 --> 23:04.535
So the honoree is sitting on our
porch looking out onto the square,

23:04.536 --> 23:06.281
and they can't set up until she goes home.

23:06.282 --> 23:07.567
It's my last night with my best friend.

23:07.568 --> 23:08.849
Well, could you move it along,

23:08.850 --> 23:10.860
because it's getting late and we were just trying…

23:11.784 --> 23:16.139
Hey, I'm just the messenger.
You're done when you're done.

23:16.140 --> 23:17.335
- I'll let them know.
-U-Hmm.

23:23.482 --> 23:26.969
Sorry about that. What's wrong?

23:28.088 --> 23:32.061
I don't know. In the past two minutes sitting here,

23:32.062 --> 23:34.257
I've managed to completely freak myself out.

23:35.245 --> 23:38.050
The call I haven't really had a
chance to stop and think about it,

23:38.051 --> 23:41.495
but I just stopped and thought, and I am really nervous.

23:42.017 --> 23:43.073
Totally understandable.

23:43.474 --> 23:45.824
But I'm, like, panic-attack nervous.

23:45.825 --> 23:49.551
Rory, you're gonna do an amazing job, okay? You always do.

23:49.552 --> 23:51.382
- See? I hate that.
- What?

23:51.383 --> 23:53.864
Everyone thinking I'm gonna
do an amazing job all the time,

23:53.865 --> 23:57.547
like it's a given. It's not a
given. What if I'm a terrible reporter?

23:57.548 --> 23:59.273
Then you'll figure out how to get better.

24:00.275 --> 24:08.497
gonna do an amazing job is because everybody knows you.

24:08.798 --> 24:10.155
Yeah, you're gonna be nervous.

24:10.156 --> 24:12.743
I mean I was nervous before I had the babies.

24:12.744 --> 24:13.976
I was throwing up all the time.

24:13.977 --> 24:14.774
You were pregnant.

24:14.775 --> 24:16.874
True, but that was 30% pregnancy,

24:16.875 --> 24:19.220
70% fear of being the world's worst mom.

24:20.033 --> 24:20.824
I don't know.

24:20.825 --> 24:24.619
I just don't know about just
picking up and leaving until who knows

24:24.620 --> 24:28.782
when and leaving my mom -- see? I'm not ready.

24:28.783 --> 24:30.913
What reporter freaks out about leaving their mom?

24:31.556 --> 24:34.588
- The lucky kind.
- It's embarrassing.

24:35.352 --> 24:36.488
How is she holding up?

24:36.489 --> 24:38.901
She's fine. She's not freaked out at all.

24:38.902 --> 24:40.937
She's making lists and buying fanny packs.

24:40.938 --> 24:43.515
She's not even a little bit sentimental.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.934
- Your mom?
- Yeah. She's really fine.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.916
I'm sure she's freaking out on the inside.

24:50.688 --> 24:51.710
I don't know. Maybe.

24:56.082 --> 24:57.958
- Lane...
- Yeah?

24:59.149 --> 25:05.368
I just… your friendship means so much to me. It's so...

25:07.460 --> 25:08.162
Me, too.

25:10.372 --> 25:12.140
I mean, I don't know what it's like to have a sister,

25:12.141 --> 25:13.370
but I feel like I do, you know?

25:14.960 --> 25:21.575
- Yeah.
- Mrs. Van Gerbig.
- Ms. Gilmore

25:27.442 --> 25:29.662
- Hey.
- Oh, hey!

25:29.963 --> 25:30.487
You're ironing?

25:30.688 --> 25:33.169
The flatter the clothes, the more will fit in your suitcase.

25:33.170 --> 25:34.851
- Oh right.
- How was Lane's?

25:35.396 --> 25:37.156
It was sad, saying goodbye.

25:38.196 --> 25:40.288
I'll bet. Oh Sookie wants you to come by tomorrow

25:40.289 --> 25:42.348
and say goodbye to her.
I made her a promise that you would.

25:42.349 --> 25:42.771
Sure.

25:42.772 --> 25:44.477
And I got that fanny pack from Jackson.

25:44.478 --> 25:46.701
I think you're right.  you're never gonna wear it unless

25:46.702 --> 25:48.828
you want to be relentlessly
teased but the other reporters.

25:48.829 --> 25:49.586
Not so much.

25:49.587 --> 25:50.959
But who knows? Maybe you should take it.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.148
You know maybe they're teasing
reporters who don't have fanny packs.

25:53.149 --> 25:55.491
Who knows what the reporter teasing edict is these days.

25:55.492 --> 25:56.561
- Mom.
- Yeah?

25:56.762 --> 25:58.611
- I don't get it.
- What?

25:58.612 --> 26:00.617
How can you be so okay with everything?

26:00.618 --> 26:02.317
Ever since I've told you that I'm leaving,

26:02.318 --> 26:04.472
you're just all busy with shopping and packing,

26:04.473 --> 26:06.683
and you seem fine with it.

26:07.801 --> 26:11.011
- It's too soon.
- What?

26:11.957 --> 26:15.706
If I stop to think about you leaving now, I'm gonna fall apart.

26:16.700 --> 26:20.247
We still have time left. It's too soon.

26:26.724 --> 26:28.706
Here. I'll iron. You fold.

26:39.447 --> 26:41.007
Hey, guys, only six chairs to a table.

26:41.008 --> 26:43.492
I think we can go eight if we
grab more from the high school.

26:43.493 --> 26:45.848
The door's chained, but I
can slip through, I'm skinny like that.

26:45.849 --> 26:48.262
Six is fine. Not everybody's gonna be sitting down at once.

26:48.733 --> 26:50.180
- We found enough tablecloths.
-Great.

26:50.381 --> 26:53.267
It turns out that East-Side Tillie
had a stash down in her basement.

26:53.268 --> 26:55.190
Woke her up out of a dead sleep.

26:55.191 --> 26:58.638
- She couldn't have been more annoyed. It was fantastic.
- Thanks.

26:58.639 --> 27:00.814
Hey Luke, I got the turntable. What's next?

27:00.815 --> 27:02.568
Why don't you help Kirk and Lulu with the lights.

27:02.569 --> 27:03.439
Okay will do.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.826
Kirk, careful stringing those lights, okay?

27:05.827 --> 27:09.021
One of those light bulbs blows, and the whole thing's useless.

27:09.586 --> 27:10.391
Luke, what do you think about these?

27:10.392 --> 27:11.353
What do I think about what?

27:11.354 --> 27:12.575
- The centerpieces.
- Oh nice.

27:12.576 --> 27:15.277
- Sookie's idea, my vegetables.
- All right, great. Thanks.

27:15.278 --> 27:18.881
- Luuuuuke! Luke!
- Yeah, Babette, over here.

27:18.882 --> 27:22.448
Oh, Luke! My ankles! Look at my ankles!

27:22.449 --> 27:23.331
Should I ask why?

27:23.332 --> 27:25.482
- Bad news, doll, it's gonna rain.
- What?

27:25.483 --> 27:26.929
Oh, yeah look at these ankles.

27:26.930 --> 27:29.036
They haven't been this swollen since hurricane bob.

27:29.037 --> 27:30.751
So then I checked the weather channel, and sure enough,

27:30.752 --> 27:32.107
Nick Walker confirmed it.

27:32.108 --> 27:34.073
There's a storm front moving in over Connecticut.

27:34.074 --> 27:34.874
It's gonna rain tomorrow?

27:34.875 --> 27:37.850
First thing in the AM, Nick Walker -- you a Nick Walker fan?

27:37.851 --> 27:40.006
-No.
- Oh, you should be.

27:40.007 --> 27:43.386
He's just terrific -- always dead on and so charming

27:43.387 --> 27:45.734
Of course, I've always had a thing for meteorologists.

27:45.735 --> 27:47.980
They're kinda like astronauts crossed with fortune tellers,

27:47.981 --> 27:50.931
- very intriguing Anyway, he says it's definite.
-  Oh.

27:51.621 --> 27:53.450
Yeah, so I thought you'd want to know.

27:53.451 --> 27:55.423
Sorry for the bad news, but you know my ankles.

27:55.724 --> 27:56.895
No, that's true. They're never wrong.

27:56.896 --> 27:58.986
No, no, My hair's only 50-50, but my ankles

27:58.987 --> 27:59.990
you could take them to the bank.

27:59.991 --> 28:00.986
What we gonna do?

28:01.487 --> 28:02.828
We could have it in the diner.

28:02.829 --> 28:03.829
We could have it in the diner.

28:03.830 --> 28:04.474
How you gonna fit 200 people in a diner?

28:04.475 --> 28:05.477
In shifts?

28:05.983 --> 28:06.815
Oh what a shame.

28:07.159 --> 28:09.207
Maybe we can break the party up into people's houses,

28:09.208 --> 28:10.061
like little party stations.

28:10.062 --> 28:11.738
You gonna wake up the whole town and arrange that?

28:11.739 --> 28:13.085
It sounded dumb while I was saying it.

28:13.086 --> 28:14.254
I can't believe it's gonna rain tomorrow.

28:14.455 --> 28:16.152
You don't suppose anybody has any idea where

28:16.153 --> 28:18.371
we could get a big wedding tent at one o'clock in the morning?

28:20.460 --> 28:21.895
It was a nice idea, man.

30:08.188 --> 30:09.784
Why is no one picking up their phones?

30:09.785 --> 30:11.158
I want to say goodbye to everyone.

30:11.159 --> 30:16.485
We'll track them all down, I promise. Rory, look.

30:23.051 --> 30:24.914
I think you're gonna get to say goodbye to everybody.

30:33.402 --> 30:36.466
- Did you...
- No, I didn't do a thing.

31:06.787 --> 31:08.383
We love you, Rory!

31:09.526 --> 31:11.760
We're so proud of you.

31:23.079 --> 31:27.062
Rory, in my official capacity as town sash presenter,

31:27.063 --> 31:28.772
I would like to present you with this sash,

31:28.773 --> 31:32.879
which I also happened to make in
my official capacity as town sash maker.

31:32.880 --> 31:33.956
Well, thank you.

31:33.957 --> 31:35.026
Kneel before me.

31:36.821 --> 31:38.752
All right, could you at least bow your head a little bit?

31:40.528 --> 31:41.767
Wow. That's quite a sash.

31:41.768 --> 31:43.857
I got the material from one of mother's nighties.

31:44.567 --> 31:47.358
We wouldn't let you go without a party, sweetheart!

31:47.359 --> 31:49.625
All right, no shoving. Let's make a line.

31:49.626 --> 31:51.420
Everybody gets a chance to hug Rory.

31:53.146 --> 31:54.565
I see mom and dad. I'll be right back.

31:56.856 --> 31:58.859
- Hey.
- This is quite a party.

31:59.325 --> 32:00.521
I know. It is, isn't it?

32:00.522 --> 32:02.512
We had to cancel a lunch with the Stuttgart's because

32:02.513 --> 32:04.451
we only heard about it from Sookie last night.

32:04.452 --> 32:05.662
Emily, that hardly matters.

32:05.663 --> 32:08.241
I didn't say it mattered. I was merely relaying the fact.

32:08.915 --> 32:10.637
Well, anyway, I'm glad you're here.

32:10.638 --> 32:11.853
We wouldn't miss it.

32:11.854 --> 32:13.766
Of course we wouldn't. We're her grandparents.

32:14.808 --> 32:17.347
I can't believe they did this for her.

32:17.348 --> 32:19.283
I don't think this is all for Rory.

32:20.119 --> 32:22.738
I think this party's a testament to you, Lorelai,

32:22.739 --> 32:24.128
and the home you've created here.

32:25.038 --> 32:27.102
-I regret that you needed…
- Richard.

32:27.103 --> 32:30.116
Now, let me finish, Emily. I regret it,

32:31.168 --> 32:34.541
- and we've…recent experience have taught me…
- Oh, please

32:34.542 --> 32:36.523
don't become one of those "I had a heart attack,

32:36.524 --> 32:38.438
let me express my every thought" types.

32:38.439 --> 32:42.891
Not every thought, dear, just this one. It takes a r

32:44.603 --> 32:47.969
A remarkable person to inspire all of this.

32:50.819 --> 32:51.895
Thanks, dad.

32:54.964 --> 32:56.171
Okay, that's enough.

32:56.172 --> 32:57.877
It's not as though the two of you are saying goodbye.

32:57.878 --> 33:00.230
May I have your attention, please?

33:01.426 --> 33:04.413
I'd like to welcome you all to this Bon Voyage party

33:04.414 --> 33:08.935
in honor of one of Stars Hollow's
favorite daughters, Ms. Rory Gilmore!

33:17.028 --> 33:18.848
I've known Rory, as have most of you...

33:18.849 --> 33:20.464
Have you given any thought to my spa idea?

33:20.465 --> 33:23.009
Oh, yeah. I don't think I'm interested, though.

33:23.010 --> 33:27.303
...Glorious spring day, pregnant with pride and anticipation,

33:27.304 --> 33:30.716
preparing to birth you from our collective womb,

33:30.717 --> 33:34.072
fully gestated and nourished.

33:34.073 --> 33:37.006
And so we breathe deep, and, with these last,

33:37.007 --> 33:40.834
painful contractions, we push you out into the world,

33:40.835 --> 33:44.621
spank your bottom, and wipe the amniotic fluid

33:44.622 --> 33:49.320
from your eyes as you issue your first independent breath.

33:49.321 --> 33:52.006
- Is this speech making you a little queasy?
- A little bit.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.859
Rory, would you like to say a few words?

34:01.840 --> 34:04.741
Thank you, Taylor, for that very unique tribute.

34:05.923 --> 34:12.206
Um... I love this place. I...I just loved growing up here,

34:12.206 --> 34:13.121
and I love all of you.

34:13.123 --> 34:16.559
And thank you so much for doing all of this.

34:16.560 --> 34:21.299
It's amazing. I just -- it's so -- oh, I'm on the verge of gushing,

34:21.300 --> 34:22.681
so I'm just gonna stop myself here.

34:22.683 --> 34:25.902
I don't want to gush, except one more thing -- to my mom,

34:26.902 --> 34:30.864
who is just everything to me and everything I am

34:30.866 --> 34:33.885
and who I'm gonna miss so much.

34:43.268 --> 34:44.987
All right, let's get this party started.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.893
- No bratwurst?
- No bratwurst.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.020
- Just corn, then.

34:56.021 --> 34:57.765
- What can I get you?
- Can't decide.

34:57.766 --> 35:00.242
Hey Luke, I'll have two hamburgers, medium rare.

35:00.243 --> 35:01.093
- Hold on a sec.
- Lorelai,

35:01.094 --> 35:03.410
we really should be going, but I want to say goodbye to Rory.

35:03.411 --> 35:04.469
I guess I'll eat later.

35:06.180 --> 35:09.432
Now, listen, instead of a spa, what about a tennis court?

35:09.433 --> 35:11.378
People love tennis. You could put a bubble over it.

35:11.379 --> 35:12.028
Oh, god.

35:12.029 --> 35:15.175
Outside the inn you could use it during the summer and winter.

35:15.176 --> 35:16.187
There's really no downside.

35:17.189 --> 35:22.008
have discussed it, and we are willing to loan you the money.

35:22.009 --> 35:22.927
Oh, mother.

35:22.928 --> 35:25.164
Standard terms, no interest.

35:25.165 --> 35:26.941
Mom, why do you want to loan me money?

35:26.942 --> 35:30.223
All it would require is the three
of us sit down and hash out the details.

35:30.225 --> 35:32.605
Obviously we want to get together with you from time

35:32.606 --> 35:34.168
to time to see how things are progressing,

35:34.169 --> 35:35.770
but we wouldn't become pests about it.

35:36.600 --> 35:41.435
Mom, why don't we just talk about it Friday night at dinner?

35:42.374 --> 35:47.537
Oh, so our Friday-night dinners are going to continue, then?

35:48.547 --> 35:52.046
Well, we might as well. I've kind of gotten used to it.

35:54.200 --> 36:00.060
All right. That sounds fine. But don't be late and don't wear jeans.

36:00.061 --> 36:01.365
When have I ever worn jeans to dinner?

36:01.366 --> 36:04.613
Well I don't know, it could very
well be Rory who enforces the dress code.

36:04.614 --> 36:06.643
I'm just saying I don't think that jeans are appropriate.

36:06.644 --> 36:09.019
Fine, spandex and a tube top it is.

36:09.020 --> 36:11.029
- Hey.
- Hey.
- My dear.

36:11.030 --> 36:15.303
Oh, thank you. Now, listen, you keep in touch,

36:15.304 --> 36:17.570
and not just postcards -- phone calls as well.

36:17.571 --> 36:18.095
Of course.

36:20.302 --> 36:23.482
It's an honor to be your grandmother, Rory Gilmore.

36:25.153 --> 36:28.717
Well, thank you, I… thank you for everything.

36:28.718 --> 36:30.285
Oh, dear.

36:30.286 --> 36:32.427
I'll walk you guys to your car.

36:35.269 --> 36:36.774
- Hey.
- Hey!

36:36.775 --> 36:38.355
It's beautiful, isn't it?

36:38.356 --> 36:40.576
It's so beautiful. I can't believe you pulled it off.

36:41.110 --> 36:43.750
No, I just did all the baking. This was all Luke.

36:43.751 --> 36:44.587
What?

36:45.317 --> 36:47.639
He made me promise not to tell you, but I don't care.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.565
This is all Luke. He did all of it.

36:50.566 --> 36:53.039
He's the one that came to me and said, "let's do the party,"

36:53.040 --> 36:56.003
and then he planned the secret town meeting, everything.

36:56.004 --> 36:57.207
Really?

36:57.208 --> 37:00.516
Yeah. I mean last night when we thought it was gonna rain

37:00.517 --> 37:01.713
and we'd have to cancel the party,

37:01.714 --> 37:05.963
he went around and collected
everybody's tarps and tents and raincoats.

37:05.964 --> 37:08.237
I don't know how he did it.

37:08.238 --> 37:10.195
He must have stayed up all night doing this.

37:10.196 --> 37:11.390
Can you believe that?

37:12.141 --> 37:16.418
- Yeah… I'll be back.
- Okay.

37:16.419 --> 37:17.524
Hey, Kirk.

37:17.525 --> 37:18.955
I can't hear you! My eardrum popped!

37:18.956 --> 37:21.838
Lorelai, if you see Luke, tell him that he and

37:21.839 --> 37:24.057
he alone is responsible for all party cleanup.

37:24.058 --> 37:24.613
Okay.

37:24.914 --> 37:26.931
Lorelai, you want to make a Morey sandwich?

37:26.932 --> 37:28.110
Maybe later, Babette.

37:39.731 --> 37:41.119
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:44.534 --> 37:45.341
Thank you.

37:45.342 --> 37:48.553
Oh, it's...no big deal.

37:50.599 --> 37:51.804
Luke

37:56.210 --> 37:58.595
I just... like to see you happy.

38:32.665 --> 38:33.976
Oh, honey, let me help you with that.

38:33.977 --> 38:35.468
-I got it.
- Oh, no, I got it.

38:35.469 --> 38:36.766
I know how to work a zipper, mom.

38:36.767 --> 38:39.202
- Okay. That's it, huh?
- Yep.

38:39.203 --> 38:40.987
- Got everything?
- I think so.

38:40.988 --> 38:42.237
Oh, what about this?

38:42.238 --> 38:43.116
That's for the plane.

38:43.117 --> 38:44.368
Oh, how about these?

38:44.369 --> 38:46.909
Um, those are old and broken. I have new ones.

38:49.277 --> 38:50.653
I just feel like I need more time.

38:50.654 --> 38:51.421
I know.

38:51.922 --> 38:54.280
I really just feel ambushed, you know?

38:54.281 --> 38:56.253
I thought I had so much more...time.

38:56.254 --> 38:57.615
I thought I had all summer to impart

38:57.616 --> 38:59.426
my wisdom about work and life and your future,

38:59.427 --> 39:01.141
and I feel like I had something to tell you.

39:01.142 --> 39:03.808
Oh, on the bus, make sure you choose a good seat,

39:03.809 --> 39:05.931
you know because people are creatures of habit,

39:05.932 --> 39:07.836
and the seat you pick in the beginning could be your seat

39:07.837 --> 39:08.799
for the rest of the year.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.237
You know. Get a window seat, honey,

39:10.238 --> 39:11.240
'cause there's so much to see.

39:11.241 --> 39:12.422
And you might want to sit in the back,

39:12.423 --> 39:15.400
because people there tend to be more chatty and

39:15.401 --> 39:18.535
friendly and -- I don't know
what it is about the front of the bus,

39:18.536 --> 39:21.821
you know but people there just tend
to be a little more bossy and uptight.

39:21.822 --> 39:23.470
It's just been that way since first grade.

39:23.471 --> 39:24.776
And, honey, I know what you're gonna say,

39:24.777 --> 39:27.403
but just don't wear shorts, okay no matter how hot it is.

39:27.404 --> 39:31.286
It's not professional, and all
that heat and those sticky vinyl seats

39:31.287 --> 39:33.017
it'll be like ripping a band-aid off

39:33.018 --> 39:34.268
your thigh every time you stand up.

39:35.317 --> 39:36.196
-- Don't be too shy.

39:36.197 --> 39:38.551
Don't be too forward, but don't be too shy,

39:38.552 --> 39:40.221
'cause you make a lovely first impression,

39:40.222 --> 39:43.076
but you really grow on people, too.

39:43.111 --> 39:43.460
Mom.

39:43.461 --> 39:44.254
You need ziplock bags.

39:44.255 --> 39:45.773
You should have them all the time, they're so handy.

39:45.774 --> 39:46.216
Mom.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.742
And I'm gonna give you that orange sweater.

39:47.743 --> 39:50.505
I know you've wanted it, and I'm
you know what finally gonna give it to you.

39:50.506 --> 39:54.783
Mom…You've given me everything I need.

40:00.205 --> 40:06.806
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:08.119 --> 40:08.588
Shall we?

40:09.499 --> 40:11.301
What's the rush? It's, like, 5:00 A.M.

40:12.374 --> 40:13.370
Got a stop to make.

40:27.198 --> 40:28.186
Mmm. The coffee smells good.

40:28.187 --> 40:30.452
- Hello, old friend.
- How is it?

40:30.453 --> 40:32.167
Your first pot is always your best.

40:32.168 --> 40:32.693
Good.

40:32.694 --> 40:33.868
Thanks for opening up the place

40:33.869 --> 40:35.270
I got to take care of my best customers.

40:36.193 --> 40:37.203
So, you guys know what you want?

40:37.204 --> 40:39.375
Oh, hmm, I have no idea.

40:39.376 --> 40:40.779
Looks like a delightful menu.

40:40.780 --> 40:42.633
Oh, it does look delightful, charming.

40:42.634 --> 40:43.828
Very charming, adorable fonts.

40:43.829 --> 40:45.039
I wish there were pictures.

40:45.817 --> 40:48.492
You know, I'm gonna need a minute. I can't decide.

40:48.493 --> 40:50.703
Take all the time you need.

40:53.781 --> 40:55.691
But could we get some eggs and bacon

40:55.692 --> 40:57.209
and hash browns to tide us over?

40:57.210 --> 40:58.805
- Coming up.
- And pancakes?

41:00.369 --> 41:01.208
Hey, I like your necklace.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.163
- Oh, you do?
- It suits you.

41:03.164 --> 41:07.450
Thanks. Hey you got to be careful when
you drink coffee on the bus, it's bumpy.

41:07.451 --> 41:08.392
I can handle it.

41:08.393 --> 41:09.981
I should have gotten you a sippy cup.

41:09.982 --> 41:11.356
Maybe I should get a flask.

41:11.357 --> 41:12.829
Do they make flasks for hot beverages?

41:12.830 --> 41:14.179
Yeah they're called thermoses.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.860
Right, I'll get you a thermos that says

41:16.861 --> 41:19.386
"World's Greatest Reporter" to match your cap.

41:19.387 --> 41:23.104
Oh, yeah, I meant to tell you that I left that cap at home.

41:23.105 --> 41:23.744
What?

41:23.745 --> 41:25.243
Well It wasn't very flattering.

41:25.244 --> 41:28.000
Well how will people know you're the world's greatest reporter?

41:28.001 --> 41:30.038
I don't know.

41:30.804 --> 41:32.356
I guess they'll just have to read your stuff.

41:32.357 --> 41:34.063
I guess so.

41:35.305 --> 41:41.942
