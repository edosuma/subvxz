WEBVTT

00:34.701 --> 00:35.901
Good afternoon, ma'am.

00:35.902 --> 00:37.102
We've received a number
of noise complaints

00:37.104 --> 00:38.737
regarding this address.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.238
Is everything okay?

00:42.776 --> 00:44.242
Your husband home?

00:47.948 --> 00:49.281
Ma'am,

00:49.283 --> 00:50.282
please step aside.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.050
We're going to have to come in.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.253
(speaking Japanese)

00:56.823 --> 00:59.758
Ma'am, we won't ask you again.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.794
Open the door
and step aside now.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.045
GIRL:
Go away. Go away.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.880
Please go away.

01:21.882 --> 01:25.584
Go away.
(speaking Japanese)

01:25.586 --> 01:28.186
(speaking Japanese)

01:28.188 --> 01:29.654
Hey.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.122
You okay?

01:31.124 --> 01:32.190
You need to leave.

01:32.192 --> 01:34.359
You're going to make them angry.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.094
Who?

01:36.096 --> 01:38.096
(whooshing)

01:38.999 --> 01:40.865
(speaking Japanese)

01:40.867 --> 01:43.068
What the hell was that?

01:47.708 --> 01:49.074
What's she saying?

01:49.076 --> 01:51.009
She says this place is...

01:51.011 --> 01:53.612
haunted.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.914
(tinkling)

01:55.916 --> 01:57.749
("Ta Hu Wa Hu Wai"
by Eddie Pongrac playing)

02:02.322 --> 02:04.956
Get her out of here! Now!

02:04.958 --> 02:07.225
(shouting in Japanese)

02:09.162 --> 02:11.296
Please stop.
Don't hurt him.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.698
Please don't.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.067
Please don't
hurt him.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.069
All right. Well,
I'm gonna go ahead and say

02:18.071 --> 02:19.404
that none of that
actually happened.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.406
I will have you know
that my old man

02:21.408 --> 02:23.341
got the story directly
from the desk sergeant

02:23.343 --> 02:24.943
who was working
that night.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.244
And it was in the papers
the next day, so...

02:26.246 --> 02:28.179
Oh, it was in the papers in 1940.
Uh-huh.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.848
Then it must be true.
Right?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.650
Yeah. I see what you're trying
to do, and it's not...

02:31.652 --> 02:33.051
it's not gonna work.
What am I trying to do?

02:33.053 --> 02:36.054
Well, uh, we are,
uh, walking up

02:36.056 --> 02:38.390
to this spooky house.
It's Halloween.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.258
And, uh, you are telling me
this ghost story

02:40.260 --> 02:42.127
that you probably stole
from<i> Tales from the Crypt</i>

02:42.129 --> 02:43.662
or<i> Haunted Lives </i>
or something like that.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.797
And it is your attempt,
your weak attempt,

02:45.798 --> 02:47.931
to try and frighten me, which... It's not
gonna work, 'cause I don't frighten easily.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.801
Hey, I'm just telling you
the story, all right?

02:49.803 --> 02:51.169
Hey! Max!

02:51.171 --> 02:53.304
DANNY: Max! Back in
the building. What's up, babe?

02:53.306 --> 02:55.206
How was the sabbatical, buddy?
Well,

02:55.208 --> 02:57.208
not to oversell it--
it was, without a doubt,

02:57.210 --> 03:00.011
the single greatest experience
of my lifetime.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.080
Working with the Twa
people in Burundi,

03:02.082 --> 03:05.083
it forever altered
my perspective on my career,

03:05.085 --> 03:07.686
my role in the world,
and what it means to be human.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.020
Well, that's fantastic.
That's awesome.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.422
And I like... You got
the beard. It looks nice.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.258
I love it! Nice new style.
Look at the long hair.

03:13.260 --> 03:16.061
Actually, this facial hair
is part of my Halloween costume.

03:16.063 --> 03:19.097
I'm playing the titular
character of the film<i> John Wick,</i>

03:19.099 --> 03:21.933
which is my latest tribute
to the film legacy of...

03:21.935 --> 03:24.102
STEVE/MAX: Keanu Reeves.
I've seen this one,

03:24.103 --> 03:26.270
and I-I like the attention
to detail, with the wedding ring

03:26.273 --> 03:28.473
and everything.
You are correct in noting

03:28.475 --> 03:31.476
that this wedding ring was worn
by the character John Wick

03:31.478 --> 03:34.279
even after the untimely passing
of his wife.

03:34.281 --> 03:37.982
However, I'm wearing it
because I married Sabrina.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.485
Excuse me?
Way to bury the lead, Max.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.955
Mazel tov, buddy.
That's, uh... that's fantastic.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.924
Congratulations, Max.
That's awesome.

03:45.925 --> 03:47.892
Hey, Chin, guess what.
Max and Sabrina tied the knot.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.228
What? That's great news!

03:50.230 --> 03:52.864
Hey.<i> Ho'omaika'i 'ana,</i> Max.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.200
Mahalo. Uh, I want to
hear all about it.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.735
Right now we got work to do.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.470
Uh, body's this way.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.472
64 years old. And
before she retired,

04:00.474 --> 04:03.374
she made a name for
herself as a TV medium.

04:03.376 --> 04:06.044
Oh, of course. I remember
all the late-night ads

04:06.046 --> 04:08.146
for her psychic hotline.
I guess it makes sense

04:08.148 --> 04:09.881
that someone like her
would choose to live in a house

04:09.883 --> 04:11.116
with this kind
of a history, huh?

04:11.118 --> 04:12.917
What history?
Uh,

04:12.919 --> 04:15.386
1940 haunting.
Everybody on the island knows

04:15.388 --> 04:18.256
about the well-documented
paranormal incident.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.991
Everybody except for
Detective Williams.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.127
Let's just stick to reality,
like what actually happened

04:22.129 --> 04:24.829
on Earth in this house tonight.
We're still trying to make sense

04:24.831 --> 04:27.232
of the scene, but, so far,
it looks like a home invasion.

04:27.234 --> 04:30.268
Now, our victim called 911
early in the evening

04:30.270 --> 04:32.204
to report an intruder.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.139
But by the time HPD got here,
she was already dead.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.774
And the weird part is,
the alarm was still armed

04:35.776 --> 04:37.542
and there's no signs
of forced entry.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.911
Okay, well, do we have
any idea how the intruder got in

04:39.913 --> 04:42.247
and out of the house?
Dispatch just sent me

04:42.249 --> 04:43.848
a recording of
the 911 call.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.984
You got to hear this.
(beep)

04:45.986 --> 04:48.820
DISPATCHER: 911, what's
your location and emergency?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.155
WOMAN:
It's back.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.489
It's in my house.

04:51.491 --> 04:53.291
DISPATCHER: Ma'am,
are you saying there's someone

04:53.293 --> 04:55.426
inside your home?
Yes.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.262
Yes. Yes, it's...

04:57.264 --> 04:59.264
it's come for me. It's come.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.099
DISPATCHER: Okay, I need you
to get to a safe place

05:01.101 --> 05:03.301
and lock the door.
(crying): Oh, my God!

05:03.303 --> 05:06.304
(woman screaming)

05:06.306 --> 05:08.573
(beep)
"It's back," huh?

05:08.575 --> 05:10.842
Yeah. If I got an
intruder in my house,

05:10.844 --> 05:13.211
I'm saying "he" or "she."
I'm not calling it "it."

05:13.213 --> 05:15.213
This is peculiar.
What is it, Max?

05:15.215 --> 05:17.182
Well, uh, well, this is just

05:17.184 --> 05:19.350
my preliminary observation. I
would have to do a full autopsy

05:19.352 --> 05:21.953
in order to give a
definitive analysis.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.355
To me, it seems that she died

05:24.357 --> 05:27.559
of a sudden and catastrophic
cardiac arrest.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.894
So nobody laid a finger on her?
No.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.563
I-In fact, based
on the disturbing phone call

05:31.565 --> 05:34.199
and the fact that her pupils
are dilated, I would say

05:34.201 --> 05:37.569
that C.O.D. was the result of
overwhelming emotional stress.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.038
Max, what are you saying,
exactly?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.973
Well, what I'm trying to say
is that,

05:41.975 --> 05:43.842
whatever it is that she saw,

05:43.844 --> 05:46.377
it literally scared her
to death.

05:48.248 --> 05:51.616
<i> (Hawaii Five-O </i>
theme song plays)

06:19.346 --> 06:22.447
(crickets chirping)

06:24.384 --> 06:26.517
It's bad enough
I'm grounded on Halloween.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.887
Why do I need a babysitter?
I'm 14.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.221
DANNY: Okay, listen to me,
if you will recall,

06:30.223 --> 06:33.424
last year, you deliberately,
deliberately

06:33.426 --> 06:36.895
disobeyed your parents and
you snuck off to a party, okay?

06:36.897 --> 06:39.063
So, this year you, uh,

06:39.065 --> 06:40.265
you serve your sentence.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.416
The babysitter's just there

06:41.417 --> 06:42.566
to make sure you do your time,
okay?

06:42.569 --> 06:45.503
So, I'm under house arrest?

06:45.505 --> 06:46.604
No, you're not
under house arrest.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.006
You are free to go
trick-or-treating

06:48.008 --> 06:49.825
with your little brother.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.643
This is cruel
and unusual punishment.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.211
Well, don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.212
All right?

06:54.214 --> 06:55.564
(doorbell dings)

06:55.565 --> 06:56.915
Doorbell. Sounds like
the babysitter's there.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.483
I love you. I got to go. Okay?

06:58.485 --> 07:00.685
Have fun.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.594
Can you help me?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.162
I seem to have lost my head.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.366
Charlie, Jerry's here!

07:15.368 --> 07:16.467
That's right.

07:16.469 --> 07:17.635
And I got big plans for us.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.470
We're gonna make
Halloween cookies,

07:19.472 --> 07:23.141
carve pumpkins and, of course,
go trick-or-treating.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.044
That all sounds so thrilling.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.313
I know, right?

07:29.616 --> 07:31.182
Oh, right.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.450
Sarcasm.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.484
I get it.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.520
(screaming)

07:37.490 --> 07:39.457
Great start, dude.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.459
<i> Uh, Nikki...</i>

07:41.461 --> 07:43.695
how long have you been
Ms. Webb's assistant?

07:43.697 --> 07:46.631
About, uh, two years now.

07:46.633 --> 07:50.335
At first she just wanted me
to organize her personal affairs

07:50.337 --> 07:54.505
and... and manage her schedule,
but... recently, it became

07:54.507 --> 07:57.675
all about keeping her company.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.610
She'd grown terrified
of being alone in the house.

07:59.612 --> 08:02.413
Oh. What, uh,
what was she scared of?

08:02.415 --> 08:03.548
(laughs)

08:03.550 --> 08:07.085
Okay, this is
gonna sound crazy...

08:07.087 --> 08:09.487
but, um...

08:09.489 --> 08:11.522
over the past month or so,

08:11.524 --> 08:15.059
Marjorie had become convinced
that she was being haunted.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.427
DANNY:
Oh, okay.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.729
By a ghost, naturally.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.730
I know.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.149
I didn't believe
it, either,

08:21.150 --> 08:23.567
but then I started to see
and hear things myself.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.503
What kind of things?

08:25.505 --> 08:26.504
Weird noises.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.438
Items disappearing

08:27.440 --> 08:29.407
then turning up somewhere else.

08:29.409 --> 08:32.543
And a few times I heard
footsteps when I knew

08:32.545 --> 08:34.078
there was no one home but me.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.546
Footsteps.

08:35.548 --> 08:37.448
If it had been one or
two isolated incidents

08:37.450 --> 08:38.783
I would have just
dismissed it, but...

08:38.785 --> 08:41.219
it kept happening.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.455
Trust me, there is something
very wrong with this house.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.790
Okay.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.291
All right, well,
uh, listen,

08:47.293 --> 08:48.459
thank you very for your time.

08:49.629 --> 08:51.396
Thank you.
CHIN: Guys.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.663
Let's take a look at this.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.235
Our vic upgraded her security
over the past two weeks

08:57.237 --> 08:59.637
and had a 16-channel
camera system installed.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.472
Which is great for us
'cause, trust me,

09:01.474 --> 09:02.573
you need to see this

09:02.575 --> 09:04.859
to believe it.
Hold on.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.144
I'm gonna cue this up
to the 911 call.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.446
Okay.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.248
It's come for me.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.483
It's come.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.418
(cries)

09:13.420 --> 09:15.153
Oh, my God!

09:15.155 --> 09:16.220
(screams)

09:32.539 --> 09:33.738
Pretty great we get
to spend this time together,

09:33.740 --> 09:34.739
huh, Uncle D?

09:34.741 --> 09:35.740
Absolutely.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.809
This place...

09:37.811 --> 09:40.144
I've heard some crazy
rumors about this place.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.546
Oh, you mean it's haunted?

09:41.548 --> 09:42.613
It's true, it is.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.082
Wait, what?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.283
I'm just kidding.
Come on.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.351
Not cool, dude.

09:47.353 --> 09:48.519
What's eating him?

09:48.521 --> 09:51.622
Nothing.
He's, uh, he scares easily.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.191
Yeah, who's to blame for that?

09:53.193 --> 09:55.093
GROVER:
What's the matter, Eric?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.861
Did your Uncle Danny
do something terrible to you?

09:56.863 --> 09:58.729
No, not really...

09:58.731 --> 10:01.866
just psychologically
scarred me for life is all.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.601
He has that effect
on some people.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.603
Halloween, 1995.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.737
I was ten.

10:06.739 --> 10:07.872
It was the first
time I was able

10:07.874 --> 10:09.107
to trick-or-treat
without my parents.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.475
So, me and some friends

10:10.476 --> 10:11.842
decided to dress up
as Power Rangers,

10:11.845 --> 10:13.544
which was already
embarrassing enough

10:13.546 --> 10:14.779
'cause I drew the short straw,
had to go as the pink one.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.414
It was all hunky-dory

10:16.416 --> 10:17.482
until we were
a few houses in,

10:17.484 --> 10:18.816
we notice we were
being followed

10:18.818 --> 10:20.885
by these creeps
with masks.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.787
So, we run, they chase us.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.789
It ends up with me getting
separated by my fellow Rangers,

10:24.791 --> 10:27.225
surrounded by a bunch of maniacs
with knives and hatchets.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.260
So, I'm guessing
your Uncle Danny was, uh,

10:29.262 --> 10:30.595
one of seven maniacs?

10:30.597 --> 10:31.730
That was pretty great.

10:31.731 --> 10:32.864
You should have seen him;
he lost his mind.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.844
Eh.

10:34.845 --> 10:36.823
I also lost control
of my bladder.

10:36.824 --> 10:38.802
Took me till high school to
shake the name Pee Pee Russo.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.838
You say I'm sadistic.
You're sick.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.041
It was not that bad, okay?

10:43.042 --> 10:45.243
A tougher kid might not have
wet his unitard.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.178

she got psychic powers,

11:20.180 --> 11:22.280
hustling folks out of
their hard-earned money.

20:48.196 --> 20:50.246
So, after this consultation
with Marjorie, the Jones family

20:50.249 --> 20:52.049
spent a fortune trying to find

20:52.051 --> 20:53.751
their son Eli.
Disgusting.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.085
They hired a private detective,
they even moved

20:55.087 --> 20:56.120
to New Orleans for six months

20:56.122 --> 20:57.755
to try and find him.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.290
But two years and tens of
thousands of dollars later,

21:00.292 --> 21:02.025
they learned that he was
already dead.

21:02.027 --> 21:05.863
In fact, he died within 48 hours
of first being reported missing.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.831
I guess Marjorie's
psychic powers

21:07.833 --> 21:09.166
were on the fritz that day.

21:09.168 --> 21:11.802
Her reputation took
a pretty big hit after that.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.337
Soon after, she retired.

21:13.339 --> 21:16.140
I mean, what she put
that family through...

21:16.142 --> 21:18.442
you got to think, man,
they had motive.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.810
Yeah, they do.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.145
Except right after
they found out,

21:21.147 --> 21:22.563
the whole family
moved to Canada.

21:22.564 --> 21:23.980
I think we can
rule them out as suspects.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.083
Yeah, makes sense.

21:26.085 --> 21:29.119

for a revenge play?

21:29.121 --> 21:31.155

22:48.367 --> 22:51.168
Well, Charlie, my man, if
you thought that recreating

22:51.170 --> 22:52.536
the Williams
family in squash plants

22:52.538 --> 22:54.238
was the highlight
of your night,

22:54.240 --> 22:57.140
think again, 'cause now
it's time for the main event.

22:57.142 --> 23:01.211
We're talking ninja-level
T.O.T., Uncle Jerry style.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.981
What's "T.O.T.?"

23:03.983 --> 23:05.499
Trick-or-treating.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.016
But wandering around aimlessly
with a bucket in your hand

23:07.019 --> 23:08.285
is for half-assers.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.120
Which is why we're
gonna hack Halloween.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.623
First, we target all the houses
with the most decorations.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.124

the top-shelf candy.

23:14.126 --> 23:16.176
And second--

23:16.177 --> 23:18.227
and this is gonna seem
counterintuitive-- we go late,

23:18.230 --> 23:20.564

23:25.204 --> 23:28.472
Sounds pretty lame to me.
Yeah, you know what's lame?

23:28.474 --> 23:30.173
This texting people
who aren't in the room,

23:30.175 --> 23:32.242
when you could be spending
time with your brother who is.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.912
Sorry, did you say something?

23:34.914 --> 23:37.180
You know what, Grace?
I'm tired of your attitude.

23:37.182 --> 23:39.249
Why don't you put
down that phone and...

24:04.710 --> 24:05.976
Check this out,
this is the attic,

24:05.978 --> 24:07.611
where there's definitely
enough room

24:07.612 --> 24:09.245
for someone to camp out
for a couple few days.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.448
That would explain
the sleeping bag.

24:11.449 --> 24:13.649
Okay, so, uh, somebody rigs up
this entire house,

24:13.652 --> 24:15.953
and then camps out in the attic
for days on end.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.487
That seems like a lot of
trouble to go through

24:17.489 --> 24:19.957
to, uh, convince an old woman
that she's being haunted, no?

24:19.959 --> 24:21.692
This guy was good, I mean,
he knew the blind spots

24:21.694 --> 24:23.193
in the security system,
which points of entry

24:23.195 --> 24:24.728
were unprotected.

24:24.729 --> 24:26.262
Good news is we did recover
fingerprints and DNA.

24:26.265 --> 24:27.531
Hopefully we'll get a hit soon.

Better known by his stage name,

24:39.144 --> 24:40.577
"Triblaine the Great."

but Marjorie was also involved

consultations over the years.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.126
I have extensive
records detailing

29:23.128 --> 29:24.561
all the damage
that she has done,

29:24.563 --> 29:27.464
which I'm happy to share
with you, free of charge.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.234
Huh? But y-you should also
know, though, that there's only

29:30.236 --> 29:31.335
a couple of places on the island

29:31.337 --> 29:33.437
where you can get
some of the, uh...

29:33.439 --> 29:38.909
items in the spook house
that you described.

29:38.911 --> 29:42.212
Happy to point you
in the right direction.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.580
All right.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.249
Looks like I got the size right.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.184
Also, I packed you
a backup bucket.

29:47.185 --> 29:49.118
That way you'll have an
extra one for the overflow.

29:51.590 --> 29:54.458
All right, Grace, it's go time,
let's do this.

yourself a year from now?

29:58.230 --> 30:00.030
I like it, very meta.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.566

candy if you wear your costume.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.067
I'm not coming.

30:04.069 --> 30:05.602
What?
Why not?

30:05.604 --> 30:07.471
It's bad enough that I'm missing
an epic Halloween party

30:07.473 --> 30:09.290
with my friends.

30:09.291 --> 30:11.108
There's no way I'm dressing up
in some stupid costume,

30:11.110 --> 30:12.910
begging for candy.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.313
Give me a sec, buddy.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.983
Do you know why I
love Halloween so much?

30:19.985 --> 30:22.319
The chocolate?

30:22.321 --> 30:23.620
Just a guess.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.289
It's because it's the
one night of the year

30:25.291 --> 30:26.690
when you can dress up,

30:26.692 --> 30:29.192
and act like a kid,
and no one judges you.

30:29.194 --> 30:31.962
Don't be in such
a hurry to grow up.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.497
There'll be plenty of time for
parties, but how many chances

30:33.499 --> 30:35.065
are you gonna get to
go trick-or-treating

30:35.067 --> 30:37.334

32:54.473 --> 32:57.107
Okay.

33:01.513 --> 33:02.813
Okay.
Okay.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.214
Let's go.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.550
GROVER:
What's up?

33:06.552 --> 33:08.085
Triblaine's alibi
checks out.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.520
He was in Europe

33:09.521 --> 33:10.954
for the past six months
doing performances.

33:10.955 --> 33:12.388
Yeah, well, that would be
one hell of a magic trick

33:12.391 --> 33:14.424
if he pulled all this off
from a different country.

33:14.426 --> 33:15.659
Yeah, we do have a lead
on another suspect.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.627
I was able to trace
several of the items

33:17.629 --> 33:19.046
recovered from the attic

33:19.047 --> 33:20.464
back to a magic store
here on the island.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.432
According to the owner,
the purchases were made

33:22.434 --> 33:23.767
by a local guy named Ian Miller.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.635
Okay. Let's bring him in.
Well, unfortunately,

33:25.637 --> 33:28.271
that won't be possible.

33:28.273 --> 33:31.808
HPD discovered the body after
responding to a noise complaint.

33:31.810 --> 33:35.612
COD was a stab wound
by stiletto blade

33:35.614 --> 33:36.613
to the posterior

33:36.615 --> 33:37.848
neck area.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.449
Liver temperature
puts the time of death

33:39.451 --> 33:40.717
at roughly two hours ago.

33:40.719 --> 33:41.718
Okay...

33:41.720 --> 33:44.387
this guy...

33:44.389 --> 33:45.722
spooks Marjorie Webb to death

33:45.724 --> 33:46.790
and then goes back
to his own house

33:46.792 --> 33:48.625
where, a few short
hours later,

33:48.627 --> 33:50.594
he's murdered?

33:50.596 --> 33:52.295
Now this is one
hell of a coincidence

33:52.297 --> 33:54.197
or somebody else knew

33:54.199 --> 33:55.632
about Marjorie's death
and wanted to make sure

33:55.634 --> 33:57.167
Ian Miller kept his mouth shut.
Right?

33:57.169 --> 33:58.401
An accomplice.

33:58.403 --> 34:00.337
Makes sense with all the...

34:00.339 --> 34:02.772
haunted house trickery
that there was two of them.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.574
Well, I may have
an answer to that.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.810
I found foreign DNA
in the form of a hair

34:06.812 --> 34:08.745
on Miller's body.
I ran it through the system

34:08.747 --> 34:10.747
and got a hit
in a most unexpected place.

34:10.749 --> 34:13.817
The DNA profile
was in the archives

34:13.819 --> 34:16.419
of old missing persons' cases.

34:16.421 --> 34:18.688
Julie Hillman.

34:18.690 --> 34:23.727
She was registered as missing
by her family in May 2010...

34:23.729 --> 34:26.596
but reported alive and well

34:26.598 --> 34:28.431
some four months later.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.468
Wait a minute, we know her.

34:31.470 --> 34:32.802
Nikki Pressman.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.838
Marjorie's assistant.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.545
(whispering):
This way.

34:43.916 --> 34:46.183
(dog barking)

34:47.786 --> 34:50.387
(men yelling)

34:51.356 --> 34:52.822
Get them back.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.201
(men yelling)

35:12.377 --> 35:15.378
Hi, uh, I'm with Five-O.

35:15.380 --> 35:16.513
I need to use your phone.

35:16.515 --> 35:17.547
It's an emergency.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.715
Uh, of course.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.684
Right this way.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.252
Everything all right?

35:22.254 --> 35:23.353
Will be, as soon as

35:23.355 --> 35:24.688
we get the
police out here.

35:24.690 --> 35:25.789
It's in the kitchen.

35:25.791 --> 35:26.990
Thank you.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.870
There's no phone.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.772
(shotgun hammer clicks)

35:42.774 --> 35:43.840
Ain't no help coming for you.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.255
It's Bobby.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.489
I got them.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.757
My place.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.626
Yeah.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.693
See you soon.

36:08.934 --> 36:11.001
KONO:
Nice to meet you, Bobby.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.770
Hey.

36:13.772 --> 36:16.006
I'm gonna call HPD.

36:17.809 --> 36:18.808
(line ringing)

36:18.810 --> 36:22.379
STEVE:
So, in May of 2010, you,

36:22.381 --> 36:24.514
Julie Hillman,
disappeared.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.915
Your parents, they
went to the police.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.634
They couldn't get
any answers and so,

36:27.635 --> 36:29.352
out of desperation,
they called Marjorie Webb.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.854
I guess I can
understand that.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.722
I would've wanted
answers myself.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.759
Any parent who loses a child
wants answers.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.644
They want to find their kid,
all right?

36:37.645 --> 36:39.528
But Marjorie Webb lied
to your parents, didn't she?

36:40.866 --> 36:42.032
She told your parents
that you were dead.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.900
They were never gonna
see you again.

36:43.902 --> 36:45.669
Now armed
with that knowledge,

36:45.671 --> 36:47.371
your father went home
and he realized

36:47.372 --> 36:49.072
he couldn't live with that,
so he killed himself.

36:49.074 --> 36:51.675
You know, the saddest part
about this story for me

36:51.677 --> 36:52.709
is that you were a kid.

36:52.711 --> 36:53.943
You ran away from home.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.945
Kids run away from home.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.915
But as soon as you found out
the effect that had on your dad,

36:58.917 --> 37:00.884
you went back home

37:00.886 --> 37:02.786
and you started
plotting your revenge.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.821
Most people would've wanted
her dead right away.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.856
I wanted her to suffer
the way my family suffered.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.525
The way I suffered.

37:08.527 --> 37:11.761
The way all those other people
she hurt suffered.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.496
I wanted her to spend
the rest of her days

37:13.498 --> 37:15.765
staring at a wall
in a mental institution,

37:15.767 --> 37:18.835
mumbling to herself
about ghosts.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.870
Believe what you want,

37:20.872 --> 37:22.005
but the plan was
never to kill her.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.006
But you did.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.341
You killed her. Okay?

37:24.343 --> 37:25.509
And then what happened?

37:25.510 --> 37:26.676
You and your partner,
Ian Miller,

37:26.678 --> 37:28.011
you're-you're looking
at a manslaughter charge

37:28.013 --> 37:28.945
you never anticipated.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.447
What happened after that?

37:30.449 --> 37:31.582
Ian must've panicked.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.716
Did he threaten
to go to the cops?

37:32.718 --> 37:34.651
I never meant
for any of this to happen!

37:34.653 --> 37:36.653
But, you see, it happened.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.988
Y-You stabbed a man in the back
of the neck and you killed him.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.757
Now you're looking
at a straight-up murder rap,

37:40.759 --> 37:42.592
on top of the manslaughter
charge.

37:44.663 --> 37:45.962
You know what?

37:45.964 --> 37:46.996
We don't even need a confession.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.531
We got her DNA.

37:48.533 --> 37:49.599
Come on.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.003
Hey, hey, Danny, hold...
just give me a second.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.943
I lost my old man, too.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.846
And there's not a day that
goes by I don't think about him,

38:02.848 --> 38:04.647
so I understand
how this must haunt you,

38:04.649 --> 38:07.417
knowing that your running away

38:07.419 --> 38:08.918
affected your dad
the way it did

38:08.920 --> 38:11.554
and if you'd have just
gone home, just gone home...

38:11.556 --> 38:14.591
your dad would probably
still be alive right now.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.559
(sniffles)

38:16.561 --> 38:19.662
I can see how blaming
Marjorie was easier.

38:19.664 --> 38:20.663
(lock buzzes)

38:20.665 --> 38:22.999
(latch clicks)

38:23.001 --> 38:24.968
What's going on?

38:24.970 --> 38:26.069
It's Kono.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.443
I can't find the keys.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.078
Okay.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.147
We have
a tactical advantage here.

38:37.149 --> 38:38.581
So, we hold them off.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.517
Wait until HPD arrives.

38:40.519 --> 38:41.818
Thing is, this
is the only gun

38:41.820 --> 38:43.520
and we only have
three shells left.

38:43.522 --> 38:46.156
All right,
we'll have to improvise.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.425
(sighs)

38:56.768 --> 38:58.034
They're coming!

39:02.040 --> 39:03.173
Dana.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.475
You got to take this, okay?

39:05.477 --> 39:06.876
Anyone comes
through that window...

39:06.878 --> 39:08.044
okay?

39:08.046 --> 39:09.145
MAN:
Bobby, open up!

39:11.450 --> 39:12.649
MAN 2:
Bobby, open the door.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.486
(screams)

39:24.696 --> 39:26.529
(screams)

39:33.171 --> 39:34.838
I'm out.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.173
Kono.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.744
Okay, fall back, down the hall.

39:41.746 --> 39:43.746
(gunshots blasting)

39:46.084 --> 39:47.750
(groans)

39:47.752 --> 39:49.219
Come on, come on, come on.

39:49.221 --> 39:50.653
I got you, I got you.

39:50.655 --> 39:51.955
In here.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.059
(gunshots blasting)

39:56.061 --> 39:58.761
(gunshots ricocheting)

39:58.763 --> 40:00.763
Okay, bathroom, come on.

40:02.234 --> 40:03.800
(gunshots ricocheting)

40:11.943 --> 40:13.610
I'm out.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.212
I got two left.

40:16.214 --> 40:18.281
(distant gunshots)

40:19.284 --> 40:21.518
(sirens wailing)

40:24.189 --> 40:26.256
(lightly chuckles)

40:33.765 --> 40:35.832
(cries)

40:52.918 --> 40:54.050
You sure you're okay?

40:54.052 --> 40:55.218
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

40:55.220 --> 40:56.686
Just, uh...
just a few cuts and bruises,

40:56.688 --> 40:58.321
a little
psychological trauma...

40:58.323 --> 41:00.123
but I'll be fine.

41:01.192 --> 41:02.325
Lou, you find anything?

41:02.327 --> 41:04.294
Plenty.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.262
HPD searched
the entire compound.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.665
They found two shallow graves
with human remains.

41:08.667 --> 41:11.067
Also found a cache
of video tapes

41:11.069 --> 41:12.902
dating back three years.

41:12.903 --> 41:14.736
It was you two stumbled
upon some kind of death cult.

41:14.739 --> 41:17.073
These psychos had a thing
for making their own

41:17.075 --> 41:19.342
horror movies
every Halloween.

41:26.751 --> 41:28.751
BOTH:
Trick or treat.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.890
Mahalo.

41:41.299 --> 41:42.332
CHARLIE:
Gracie, you came.

41:42.334 --> 41:43.633
How'd you guys do?

41:43.635 --> 41:46.269
Not so good.

41:47.238 --> 41:48.605
Come on, Charlie.

41:48.607 --> 41:49.672
I know a house up the street

41:49.674 --> 41:52.375
that's always stocked.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.081
My work here is done.
