08:50.533 --> 08:52.433
- I mean, it's been 20 minutes.

08:52.467 --> 08:54.166
Ugh.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.700
- Oh, that's nice.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.033
- It's got to get here first.
- Oh, f---.

08:58.033 --> 08:59.333
- Don't do anything
to make her spill it.

08:59.367 --> 09:00.734
- I'm not even looking at her.

09:00.734 --> 09:03.467
- Yeah.
- And here is a Cosmo.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.700
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:05.734 --> 09:07.600
Do you guys want to go ahead
and have a seat at the table?

09:07.600 --> 09:09.133
- Thank you very much.
Bless your heart.

09:11.367 --> 09:13.166
- So we'll start with
some salads,

09:13.200 --> 09:16.200
a nice spring mix
with fresh tomatoes.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.066
- I'm gonna need
another cocktail.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.600
I know how you guys like
to take your time,

09:19.600 --> 09:21.467
so I'm just gonna order it now.

09:21.467 --> 09:24.200
- Am I being belittled,
or is this normal?

09:24.200 --> 09:26.066
I'm just very confused.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.600
- Do you know how
to pour an ounce?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.600
- No. I'm just--

09:29.633 --> 09:32.467
- This--I mean, for her, yeah.
- Not by hand.

09:32.467 --> 09:34.333
- No, I know.
- I don't--

09:34.367 --> 09:36.734
- Just for, like, the future.
- You're confusing me.

09:36.734 --> 09:38.700
Whatever.

09:38.734 --> 09:41.433
- I'm afraid by the time
it's gonna take for her

09:41.467 --> 09:43.433
to learn the job,

09:43.467 --> 09:45.000
we're gonna be done
with the season already.

09:45.734 --> 09:47.700
Here you go.

09:47.734 --> 09:50.767
- Oh, aren't you sweet just
delivering it with your hands,

09:50.767 --> 09:52.500
your bare hands,

09:52.500 --> 09:56.100
like a f---ing cavewoman
just with your hands.

09:56.100 --> 09:59.400
I know I said light pink,
but that's pretty clear.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.233
- Yeah.

10:02.233 --> 10:03.367
- So how would you like your
steak?

10:03.367 --> 10:05.033
- Medium rare.

10:05.066 --> 10:06.100
- I'll have mine rare please.
- Rare?

10:06.100 --> 10:07.400
Okay. Coming right up.

10:08.367 --> 10:10.767
- Even though I think this
dinner service--it's silly--

10:10.767 --> 10:12.600
I'm not gonna half-ass it.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.233
I'm gonna play the part,
look the part, get the part.

10:14.266 --> 10:15.734
- Oh!

10:15.767 --> 10:17.767
- There you go.
Here's your medium rare.

10:17.767 --> 10:20.333
- Oh, this is way longer
than I hoped it would be.

10:20.367 --> 10:23.266
- I know it's the one night
we could, like, relax.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.000
- Pay some bills.
- Nope.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.133
This is cruel
and unusual punishment.

10:29.166 --> 10:30.734
- What's going on?
- Both new stews

10:30.767 --> 10:32.633
are doing dinner service

10:32.667 --> 10:34.667
for Captain Lee and Kate
just for improvement.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.233
- I think so.

10:37.266 --> 10:40.100
- You can have this.
- Yep.

10:40.133 --> 10:42.000
That was very good
clearing by the way.

10:42.033 --> 10:44.667
- Okay, thanks.
- I'm tired of teaching.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.400
- All right, let's get
them in here.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.133
- Hey, girls,
you want to come out here?

10:48.133 --> 10:51.133
- Yes.
- So some observations.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.100
- Make drinks quickly.

10:53.133 --> 10:55.066
- That's the only thing
saving you

10:55.100 --> 10:56.600
from the wrath of your guests.

10:56.633 --> 11:01.133
Always use a tray. You never
hand-deliver anything.

11:01.133 --> 11:03.667
You two are intelligent ladies,

11:03.700 --> 11:06.033
and I expect you
to learn quickly.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.567
- You guys did better
than I expected.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.266
- It was an experience
to remember for sure.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.166
- With Bri there is
a glimmer of hope.

11:12.166 --> 11:16.000
With Jen, it's more
like a glimmer of nope.

11:16.033 --> 11:18.166
- Thank you.
- Thank you .

11:21.300 --> 11:22.233
[alarm beeping]

11:24.433 --> 11:27.066
- Hey, Jen, we got work
in ten minutes.

11:29.066 --> 11:30.700
- Sh-- is moving so much, dude.
- I know.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.300
I know, dude. It's windy today.
See this wheel?

11:33.300 --> 11:34.400
- Yeah.
- It's not even

11:34.433 --> 11:36.166
f---ing round any more.

11:36.166 --> 11:38.433
I knew this job was gonna be
a lot to take in,

11:38.467 --> 11:40.433
and I'm doing my best to learn.

11:40.433 --> 11:43.400
The quicker I learn, the better
I can make myself look,

11:43.433 --> 11:46.333
which I seem to have an issue
with that right now.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.066
- Today's gonna be a bad day
to get off the dock.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.600
- People train their entire
lives to be sushi chefs.

12:01.633 --> 12:05.066
They go from cooking
the sush--the rice--for years

12:05.066 --> 12:06.734
before they even be able
to touch seaweed.

12:06.734 --> 12:08.734
I f---ing hate sushi.
No, I hate it.

12:08.734 --> 12:10.400
Oh, man.

12:12.734 --> 12:15.066
- Hi. How are you? I'm Kate.

12:16.066 --> 12:19.200
- Hi, Morton. All right,
we have guests arriving.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.600
What are you doing?

12:20.600 --> 12:22.333
This is really why
I got into yachting.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.333
Well, I'll see you later.

12:24.333 --> 12:27.300
Maybe sail off into the sunset
with a hot foreign guy.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.734
Bye.

12:29.767 --> 12:32.200
- All crew, we got provisions
down on the dock.

12:34.633 --> 12:37.633
- I'm sailing to Guadalupe
tomorrow with hot Jesus.

12:37.667 --> 12:40.033
- With who? Hot Jesus?
- I'm not even joking.

12:40.066 --> 12:42.300
He's from Sweden.
His name's Morton.

12:44.066 --> 12:45.233
- I know.

12:45.233 --> 12:47.300
[phone chiming]

12:47.333 --> 12:49.567
- Hey, Steve.
Our first officer's sick.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.567
- Well, we need a replacement.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.734
- Yeah, I mean, I can't expose
our charter guests to that.

12:53.767 --> 12:55.633
- Yeah?
- I don't have a first mate,

12:55.667 --> 12:59.500
and it's totally illegal
to leave the dock without him.

12:59.500 --> 13:03.100
I can't move the boat
until we get somebody in here.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.233
Could you maybe do it
and get away with it?

13:05.266 --> 13:10.233
Yeah, but not with the crew
that I've got.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.400
- [laughs] You are totally just
relaxing.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.333
- I took a moment
to look at the boats.

13:19.367 --> 13:21.000
I think that's when
you caught me.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.266
Bri's pretty.
She's a pretty girl.

13:23.266 --> 13:25.233
I really, really like her.

13:25.266 --> 13:26.533
Are you on lates this time?

13:26.567 --> 13:28.400
- I don't know.
- I'm on lates.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.533
We can hang out...

13:29.567 --> 13:30.767
- Yeah.
- And be friends.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.266
- We'll see.

13:32.266 --> 13:33.667
- Attention all crew,

13:33.667 --> 13:35.767
I need everybody
for a staff meeting

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
in the crew mess ASAP right now.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.667
So we have a situation.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.600
Our first officer is sick,

13:45.633 --> 13:48.133
so he's gonna have
to leave the boat,

13:48.166 --> 13:50.100
and I'm gonna work
on a replacement ASAP,

13:50.133 --> 13:52.433
and given the fact
that we have charter guests

13:52.433 --> 13:54.567
coming on in less
than two hours,

13:54.567 --> 13:57.533
we are not going to move
the boat off the dock today

13:57.567 --> 13:59.633
because our crew is so green

13:59.667 --> 14:02.166
that I'm not comfortable
with it.

14:02.166 --> 14:04.300
- I am completely embarrassed.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.166
I mean, we can't leave the dock
because of my deck team.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.300
- We're gonna tell
the charter guests

14:08.300 --> 14:10.266
that we have a mechanical issue,

14:10.300 --> 14:13.033
and give them
the options of Jet Skis,

14:13.066 --> 14:15.033
Seabobs, water toys.

14:15.033 --> 14:17.300
- The fact that we're staying
on the dock is great.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.033
I feel like
I've got the day off.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.567
That means I can get off
the boat to go see Jesus.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.166
Christmas came early.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.166
- I do not,
under any circumstance,

14:24.166 --> 14:25.700
want the charter guests to know
that we have an ill crew member.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.166
- Yep.
- Thank you.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.600
- Roger that.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.734
- It sucks when you're stuck
at the dock.

14:32.734 --> 14:36.066
- I'm so happy.
- Why?

14:36.066 --> 14:37.734
- I'm sailing to Guadalupe
with Hot Jesus.

14:37.767 --> 14:39.467
- Who the hell is Hot Jesus?

14:39.500 --> 14:41.133
- [laughs] I just met him down
at the dock.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.567
- Really?
- Yes,

14:42.600 --> 14:44.200
and we're staying
at the dock longer,

14:44.233 --> 14:47.033
so that gives me plenty
of time to go to church.

14:47.066 --> 14:48.600
- You're gonna need to go
to church after you go to church

14:48.600 --> 14:51.033
if you know what I mean.

14:51.066 --> 14:53.200
- Yachting is like being
stranded on a desert island.

14:53.233 --> 14:55.133
Who would I want
to be stranded with?

14:55.166 --> 14:56.600
Someone that makes me laugh.

14:56.633 --> 14:58.734
I can teach them
to get coconuts.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.600
- [laughs]

15:00.600 --> 15:02.033
- All crew, I'm gonna need
everybody

15:02.066 --> 15:03.600
on the main deck aft in 15.

15:03.633 --> 15:05.200
- Can I just sleep for the day?
- I got you, Nic.

15:05.233 --> 15:06.600
- Simple but elegant.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.467
- Hello. How are you?
- How you doing?

15:11.500 --> 15:13.200
Captain Lee.
- John.

15:13.233 --> 15:14.767
- Hello, I'm Brianna.
- Good to meet you.

15:14.767 --> 15:16.333
- Hi, I'm Jen.
- Megan? Good to meet you.

15:16.367 --> 15:18.100
- Hi, I'm Matt.
Good to meet you.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.633
- Good to meet you too.
- Hi, my name's Matt.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.767
- Nick. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Nick.

15:21.767 --> 15:23.233
- Nico. Nice to meet you guys.
- Guys, welcome aboard "Valor."

15:23.266 --> 15:24.500
- Cheers.
- Cheers, you guys.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.767
- Cheers.
- Thank you, John.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.500
- Totally.

15:27.500 --> 15:30.767
- I do have a little bit
of bad news for you.

15:30.767 --> 15:32.633
We are experiencing
a mechanical problem,

15:32.633 --> 15:34.633
so we won't be able
to get off the dock

15:34.633 --> 15:37.767
as quickly as we'd like to,

15:37.767 --> 15:41.233
but as soon as it gets fixed,
we are out of here.

15:41.266 --> 15:43.100
- Cool.
- Kate's gonna take you

15:43.100 --> 15:44.600
on a tour of the boat,

15:44.633 --> 15:46.367
show you your quarters,
and get you settled in.

15:46.367 --> 15:49.166
- Sounds good.
- Right this way, guys.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.700
- Oh, my God.
- So this is our main salon.

15:51.734 --> 15:54.367
- We have some bad news.
There's no alcohol on this trip.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.667
- I'll go to the master first.
- That'd be me.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.633
- This is your master stateroom.

15:58.667 --> 16:02.533
- O-M-G. You all don't need
to see this room.

16:02.533 --> 16:06.100
- Whoo.
- This is our sundeck, Jacuzzi,

16:06.133 --> 16:08.000
bunny pad.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.533
- Gorgeous. Oh, this is gonna be
real fun when we're tipsy.

16:10.533 --> 16:12.533
- The vibe of this
group is sassy...

16:12.533 --> 16:15.667
- They're greasing
up that motor.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.667
- Catty,...
- I need, like, Dramamine maybe.

16:17.667 --> 16:20.467
- Calm down.
- You're a Dramamine girl.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.467
- What's your hunger level right
now?

16:21.500 --> 16:23.266
- Oh, who's that?

16:23.266 --> 16:24.667
- Yes, please.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.633
- It's gonna be a very
long 48 hours.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.266
- Like, some snacks, like,
light snacks or something?

16:28.300 --> 16:30.300
- Yep.
I'll bring it out right here.

16:33.133 --> 16:35.467
Hi, love. 2:30 lunch.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.700
- Perfect.
- Snacks to get you started.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.567
- Some salsa.
- Okay, so we have not

16:39.567 --> 16:43.300
even had a second to talk
about this seafood extravaganza.

16:43.333 --> 16:46.033
- I like--I like that.
That's really nice.

16:46.033 --> 16:48.567
- It's not a great sign that
Matt is looking in a cookbook

16:48.567 --> 16:50.667
for how to make sushi,

16:50.700 --> 16:53.133
but what's even scarier is that
he's not embarrassed about it.

16:53.166 --> 16:56.433
- I got these really cool wooden
plates for the sushi, but--

16:56.433 --> 16:58.433
- Oh, yeah, we should
definitely use those.

16:58.433 --> 17:00.433
- I only have four
of them though.

17:00.433 --> 17:02.433
- Being stuck at the dock,
the chef has to be

17:02.433 --> 17:06.300
on his A-game,
and I'm a little nervous.

17:06.300 --> 17:10.667
- Coming up.
- Ah! Oh, shnickers.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.500
- Where is Kate?
- It's a sign from God.

17:12.533 --> 17:14.700
He wants me
to hang out with Jesus.

17:21.767 --> 17:22.400
- Hello, guys, how we doing?

17:22.400 --> 17:22.533
- Hello, guys, how we doing?
- Good.

17:23.734 --> 17:25.567
- Great.

17:25.600 --> 17:28.033
So we're gonna have your lunch
served around 2:00 or 2:30.

17:28.066 --> 17:30.000
If you want to play around
for the next two hours,

17:30.033 --> 17:31.333
we can get you out
in the tender.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.533
We have our Seabobs, Jet Skis.

17:33.567 --> 17:35.467
- Let's do that.
- Yeah, let's do that.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.400
- Just because we can't get off
the dock doesn't mean that

17:37.433 --> 17:40.467
as an exterior team
we can't entertain these people.

17:40.467 --> 17:43.467
I want all the fins and snorkels
inside the tender right now.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.200
I want to work for that tip,
and that's what I want to see

17:46.200 --> 17:47.734
in every single person
on my deck.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.400
So gentlemen, whoever's
going on the Jet Skis

17:49.433 --> 17:50.467
can come on down here.

17:50.467 --> 17:52.200
- I need to be in front.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.600
- You don't want to be
the submissive one?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.300
- Nice and slow. Hold on.
Nice and slow.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.200
Guys, let's make our way
to the tender here.

17:57.233 --> 17:58.667
- Welcome aboard.
- Have fun, guys.

17:58.700 --> 18:01.600
- Off we go.
- Oh, sh--.

18:03.633 --> 18:06.767
Slow it down, sister.
I'm wearing your drink.

18:06.767 --> 18:09.433
- Why do you think I sat here?
- [laughs]

18:13.233 --> 18:15.433
- One of our guests
owns a couple restaurants.

18:15.467 --> 18:17.500
That puts a little bit
more pressure on me.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.767
- Ooh.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.333
- Think I want
to try the Seabob.

18:23.367 --> 18:25.600
You're like a human dolphin.

18:28.667 --> 18:30.133
- That looks awesome
[inaudible], bro.

18:33.367 --> 18:34.400
- Matt. Matt.

18:36.367 --> 18:38.166
- Copy. Thank you.

18:39.367 --> 18:41.066
- Watch yourself.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.266
- Yum-yum-yum.
- That looks good.

18:43.300 --> 18:44.734
Smells good.

18:44.767 --> 18:46.000
- All right, ladies,
let's do this.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.367
- So...

18:47.400 --> 18:49.266
- So, like, I'm gonna
eat it like that.

18:49.266 --> 18:50.734
Put this--Yeah, put this down,
and I want to eat like this.

18:50.767 --> 18:52.367
Hold your salad
up straight please.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.367
- Oh, [inaudible].
- Hold your salad.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.133
Jen is a little on the slow
side, but she gets work done.

18:58.166 --> 18:59.533
Getting better.

18:59.533 --> 19:02.266
- This is a beef tenderloin
stir-fry

19:02.266 --> 19:04.367
with a sesame side salad.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.533
- This dressing is delicious.

19:09.533 --> 19:11.000
- Right?
- So good.

19:11.033 --> 19:12.734
- That's awesome.
- They're happy?

19:12.767 --> 19:15.000
- Good stuff.
- Thank God.

19:15.033 --> 19:16.667
- Nick, Nico.
- How's it going?

19:16.700 --> 19:18.200
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

19:18.233 --> 19:19.734
- Show Nick around.
- Okay.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.633
Thank God Nick came.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.333
These people paid
a lot of money to be here.

19:23.367 --> 19:24.700
And they didn't pay
to sit on the dock.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.767
Like, these guys
need f---ing supervision

19:27.000 --> 19:29.433
when it comes to f---ing,
really, anything.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.433
- We're gonna need to do
tequila shots.

19:31.467 --> 19:33.400
- Sounds good.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.166
- I do not know.
- I'm not buying it.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.567
You mean to tell me that
you're not gonna test the boat

19:39.600 --> 19:43.033
before you have someone that has
come out to pay for a charter,

19:43.033 --> 19:44.166
and you're gonna say
it's broken?

19:44.166 --> 19:45.700
- Would you guys relax?

19:45.700 --> 19:47.533
- I just think
that's poor planning.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.433
- Here is yours.
- It's about time, Jen.

19:49.433 --> 19:51.300
[laughter]

19:51.300 --> 19:52.367
- We need five more drinks.
- With the rice...

19:52.400 --> 19:55.033
[inaudible]

19:55.066 --> 19:57.700
"The hot rice,
shallow dish is covered."

19:57.700 --> 20:00.500
[inaudible].

20:00.533 --> 20:01.700
"Start the..."
[inaudible].

20:01.700 --> 20:04.433
Hey, sushi, I hate you.

20:04.467 --> 20:06.500
Sh--.

20:09.367 --> 20:14.066
- Get ready.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.066
- In yachting, you take it to,
like, the next level,

20:16.066 --> 20:17.600
and we're
serving sushi this evening.

20:17.633 --> 20:21.000
- Yeah.
- Um, how tall are you?

20:21.033 --> 20:22.467
- Six feet?

20:22.500 --> 20:24.467
- I'm a little bit nervous
about dinner.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.200
- [laughs]

20:26.233 --> 20:28.066
- What size leaf are you
working with do you think?

20:28.100 --> 20:31.400
How do you feel about being
the sushi platter tonight?

20:31.433 --> 20:32.734
- Sure.
- Okay.

20:32.767 --> 20:34.734
Bruno's really proud
of his body,

20:34.734 --> 20:36.533
so let's use that
to our advantage.

20:36.567 --> 20:38.266
I think the guests
are gonna love it.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.734
The crew's gonna love it.
You're welcome.

20:39.734 --> 20:42.066
- Oh.
- Oh.

20:42.066 --> 20:46.033
- The idea of being this sushi
human naked person, I'm scared.

20:46.066 --> 20:48.233
I'm very scared. Oh, God.

20:52.100 --> 20:54.100
- Just, like, get it over with.

20:54.100 --> 20:56.467
I am confident that my sushi
rolls will be great.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.500
I got Oahu tuna and salmon.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.100
It smelled and tastes
like candy.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.233
- Mmm.

21:01.266 --> 21:02.500
Ugh.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.100
But it's all about the rice.

21:04.133 --> 21:05.367
Come on.
You've got this.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.033
If you don't cook it properly,

21:07.066 --> 21:08.033
it's not gonna
really hold together.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.467
Ah.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.633
- It is weird.
It's so f---ing weird.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.166
- It's not weird.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.633
Bruno looks good
in his shorts,

21:14.667 --> 21:18.166
but needs a little help
to say the least.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.567
I'm not trying to say anything,

21:19.600 --> 21:21.367
but you know,
stuff that a little bit.

21:21.400 --> 21:25.100
- Chris, where's Matt?
- A little bit more.

21:25.100 --> 21:28.567
You bring out the D,
you get more C-A-S-H.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.200
Okay. Okay, cowboy boots.

21:30.233 --> 21:32.066
- I look like a cheap
whore, man.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.734
[laughs]

21:38.767 --> 21:40.667
- Oh, I should've put
apple in here.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.133
Motherf---er.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.600
- I wouldn't go crazy with this

21:43.633 --> 21:45.000
'cause we're gonna put it
on Bruno's body.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
- What?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
- So girls, this is your model
for tonight for the naked sushi.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
- Oh, my God.

21:53.033 --> 21:55.300
- Don't get me wrong.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.633
I could've done naked sushi...
- This is the Oahu.

21:58.667 --> 21:59.767
- But usually it's,
like, a plate.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.467
- I'm not--Okay.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.233
- But I don't think
they're gonna like that.

22:03.266 --> 22:04.667
- Is everybody ready?
- Oh, we're so ready.

22:04.667 --> 22:06.533
- Showtime.
- I'm ready. Okay.

22:06.567 --> 22:10.000
Our first
course tonight is sushi.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.567
- Yes! I didn't even see that.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.000
- Wait. Is that Bruno?

22:13.033 --> 22:14.633
- I want the one on the star.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.233
[laughter]

22:34.700 --> 22:36.767
- I'm just gonna reach in
and grab this one.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.433
- Oh!
- Oh, my f---ing God.

22:39.467 --> 22:42.300
- What is in there?

22:42.333 --> 22:43.700
- [laughs]

22:43.734 --> 22:45.166
My happy smile.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.567
- Bruno! Bruno!

22:48.567 --> 22:51.100
- Would I have done the naked
sushi for six gay men?

22:51.133 --> 22:54.200
Hell, yeah. Yeah.
I like making money.

22:54.233 --> 22:55.734
- Bruno!

22:55.734 --> 22:57.133
- Yee-haw.

22:57.166 --> 22:59.200
- The sushi's real good though.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.667
- So yellow.

23:00.700 --> 23:02.066
- That is the coconut
carrot puree.

23:02.066 --> 23:03.300
- Whoo.
- You're all set.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.333
- Jen.
- Hey, hey, focus.

23:04.367 --> 23:05.467
- Whoo.
- Oh.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.400
- Hi, how are you?

23:07.433 --> 23:12.734
This is mahi over carrot coconut
puree with micro asparagus.

23:12.734 --> 23:14.467
- Yum. Thank you.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.333
- That is really good.

23:16.367 --> 23:18.100
- Yes.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.133
- So good.

23:25.166 --> 23:27.133
- So good.
- Um, just wake up

23:27.166 --> 23:29.333
in 8 1/2 hours
after whatever time it is.

23:29.333 --> 23:31.533
- Good night. Good night.
- Good night.

23:31.567 --> 23:35.166
- My glass is on my...

23:35.200 --> 23:36.600
- Knife? That's a knife.

23:36.633 --> 23:39.066
- No, it's called a...
- Chopsticks.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.433
- Chopstick.
[laughter]

23:43.400 --> 23:45.066
- Focus.
Wash the dishes. Get in there.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.233
- Yes. Yes.
- Now.

23:46.233 --> 23:48.033
- I got it.

23:48.066 --> 23:49.700
- On every charter yacht
I think it's pretty normal

23:49.734 --> 23:52.600
for the chief stewardess
to retire after dinner service

23:52.633 --> 23:55.033
and let the third stew
take over late service.

23:55.066 --> 23:56.500
Clean. Clean.

23:56.533 --> 23:59.333
- Okay.
- Jen has everything handled.

23:59.367 --> 24:02.033
- Cheers, bitches.
- Oh, no.

24:03.767 --> 24:05.333
I mean, I'm not gonna
be gone long.

24:06.633 --> 24:09.166
- No, I'm going to see
the captain.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.734
- I don't believe you.
- You got this.

24:10.767 --> 24:12.500
You're my backup.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.700
I think the fact
that I just happen to meet this

24:14.734 --> 24:18.467
very similar-to-Jesus-looking
person, it's a sign from God.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.667
He wants me to
hang out with Jesus.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.400
Hey. [inaudible].

24:23.400 --> 24:26.266
- Ah!
- Ah! Oh, shnickers.

24:26.266 --> 24:29.000
- There's a little spill
in aisle seven.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.266
- I'll clean it up.

24:30.266 --> 24:32.066
- Hey, this is nice.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.333
- I just want a little vodka...

24:33.367 --> 24:35.734
- [inaudible]
- Not too sweet.

24:35.767 --> 24:39.734
- Jen! Can you pour shots?
- Oye.

24:39.767 --> 24:42.400
- Man, this is so relaxing.

24:42.433 --> 24:44.533
- Jen, take your shirt off.

24:44.533 --> 24:46.333
- I can't. It's a dress.
- Stop.

24:46.367 --> 24:47.667
- John, stop.
- Kate's nowhere to be found,

24:47.700 --> 24:50.400
and it's so frustrating.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.400
- [inaudible].

24:52.433 --> 24:54.266
- They have a juicer.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.000
- I know. I see it.
- I'm not your bitch, bitch.

24:56.033 --> 24:58.567
- Open it!
- Ugh, scary.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.033
- [laughs]

25:01.066 --> 25:04.133
[laughter]

25:04.166 --> 25:06.433
- Are you asking?
- Matt, is eggplant parmesan

25:06.433 --> 25:08.433
really gonna go
good with tequila?

25:08.433 --> 25:13.333
- Um, well, the tequila and
the tomato that we have, um...

25:19.467 --> 25:19.633
[laughter]

25:21.166 --> 25:22.633
- I'm gonna go to bed.

25:22.667 --> 25:23.700
- Yeah, I just hang out
until the guests are

25:23.700 --> 25:26.033
[inaudible].

25:26.033 --> 25:30.166
- Close it. Close it.
Close it.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.300
- Where's the sky lounge?
- Obviously where the sky ends.

25:32.300 --> 25:34.033
- Around the corner
and up the stairs.

25:34.066 --> 25:36.300
- I need a tissue.
Can I have a tissue?

25:36.300 --> 25:38.300
- You can have
whatever you want, yes.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.300
- Could I have more ice?
Just a little bit please.

25:40.333 --> 25:43.734
- Yeah.
This is a really hard tissue.

25:43.767 --> 25:46.734
- You don't recycle?
- Ask Kate. Don't look at me.

25:46.767 --> 25:48.400
- I don't know.
That's what I want to know.

25:48.433 --> 25:49.567
She's in bed.
- Is she the worst one

25:49.600 --> 25:50.567
on the boat, on the yacht?

25:50.600 --> 25:51.633
- I didn't say it.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.300
[funky music]

25:55.333 --> 26:00.433
- Man, this is so relaxing.

26:01.734 --> 26:03.734
- Good.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.066
- So, like, we're not supposed
to leave the boat, right?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.333
- No. I don't know.
- I mean, obviously--I mean,

26:10.333 --> 26:12.734
she's telling us
that we can't do that.

26:12.767 --> 26:14.567
I mean, [inaudible]

26:14.600 --> 26:16.200
- It's kind of weird that
she gets to do it, right?

26:16.200 --> 26:19.400
- Yeah.
I'm trying to find my balance,

26:19.433 --> 26:21.100
but she's making it
really difficult,

26:21.100 --> 26:23.100
and I'm really actually
quite perturbed,

26:23.100 --> 26:25.100
and I really want to
throw her under the bus,

26:25.100 --> 26:27.767
and I want both the wheels
to just hit her.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.500
- Keep prodding until you get
something, you know?

26:30.500 --> 26:33.734
- Get in or get out.

26:33.767 --> 26:36.367
This is not happening.
- Kiss me right now.

26:36.367 --> 26:39.633
Kiss me right now.

26:39.633 --> 26:42.133
- [laughs]

26:45.367 --> 26:46.633
I'm wasted.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.567
- I'm going to bed.

26:50.367 --> 26:51.400
- Come on.

26:54.100 --> 26:55.500
- Thank you so much, Chris.
- Good night.

26:55.533 --> 26:56.600
- Good night.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.533
- Do you think
we can top yesterday?

27:25.533 --> 27:27.367
- Without a doubt.

27:27.400 --> 27:30.133
- Maybe we'll get you
on a table tonight.

27:30.133 --> 27:31.667
- Bri is like a breath
of fresh air.

27:31.700 --> 27:34.633
She smiles, and you're
instantly comfortable.

27:34.667 --> 27:36.467
You're so wonderful.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.266
- Thank you.

27:38.300 --> 27:41.400
- You know when you have
chemistry with someone.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.100
Bri and I have
chemistry together.

27:43.133 --> 27:45.233
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

27:45.266 --> 27:48.033
- I don't feel all that great.
- [laughs]

27:48.033 --> 27:51.300
- Ugh. Ugh.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.033
- Let's get this boat
off the dock.

27:53.066 --> 27:55.033
- Copy.
Good morning.

27:55.066 --> 27:56.300
We're gonna get you guys off the
dock right away this morning.

27:56.333 --> 27:58.166
- That's great.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.667
- So those guys aren't allowed
to touch the lines,

27:59.700 --> 28:01.300
but I want one back
here with you

28:01.300 --> 28:03.166
and then one up there with me.
- Okay.

28:03.166 --> 28:05.166
- Bruno, you're gonna be
on the stern just watching,

28:05.166 --> 28:07.300
and Chris, you're gonna be on
the bow watching me and Baker.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.567
- All right, let's hustle up.
Bow to stern.

28:09.567 --> 28:11.133
- Hey-hey-hey. Yeah.

28:11.166 --> 28:12.700
- Is he off?
- Uh, yep. Off.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.433
- He's off. Pull-pull-pull-pull-
pull-pull-pull.

28:14.467 --> 28:17.500
That's good. Thank you.
Bow line's clear.

28:17.533 --> 28:20.233
Bruno, stand by the tender and
make sure it's not moving, okay?

28:20.266 --> 28:21.767
- Nice job, guys. Well done.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.433
- All right. Whew.

28:23.433 --> 28:25.467
- Oh, my God,
this is incredible.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.066
- How's everyone feeling?

28:33.100 --> 28:34.266
[laughter]

28:34.300 --> 28:36.066
- Oh, look who it is.

28:36.100 --> 28:37.600
[laughter]

28:37.600 --> 28:39.066
- Did you sleep all right?

28:39.100 --> 28:40.700
- Better than I have
in a long time.

28:40.734 --> 28:42.066
- Me too.

28:42.066 --> 28:43.333
- Yes.
- Thank you, hon.

28:43.333 --> 28:45.600
- You're welcome.
- So good.

28:45.633 --> 28:48.433
- Okay, standing by, Captain.
- And drop.

28:48.467 --> 28:50.233
Give me three shots.

28:51.467 --> 28:53.567
All right, start just
cabling up straight up.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.333
What's gonna happen
to the RIB?

28:55.333 --> 28:56.734
- Well, it's gonna move.
- Which way?

28:56.767 --> 28:58.533
- Forward.
- Right.

28:58.567 --> 29:00.066
The last charter
getting their RIB in the water,

29:00.066 --> 29:01.734
it was just a cluster f---.

29:01.734 --> 29:03.700
- Pull it. Pull it.

29:03.734 --> 29:07.734
- Wait-wait-wait-wait.
- Ugh!

29:07.734 --> 29:09.500
- F---ing damn it.
- Are you ready to pick?

29:09.533 --> 29:11.300
- Yes, sir.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.200
- This means you want
the boom down, all right?

29:13.233 --> 29:15.367
That was a good straight pick.

29:15.367 --> 29:17.767
- Pull that in.
- And all the way down.

29:17.767 --> 29:19.367
- All right, Chris,
pay attention here.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.100
- Yep.
- Hold on to your line, yeah?

29:21.133 --> 29:23.500
- Hold on to it?
- Yep. All right, getting in.

29:23.533 --> 29:26.200
All clear.
- Nice job, Bruno.

29:28.633 --> 29:30.767
- When you're cooking for people
with different preferences,

29:30.767 --> 29:32.633
it becomes complicated,

29:32.633 --> 29:36.500
so I try to stay as close
to my comfort zone as I can,

29:36.500 --> 29:39.100
but I'm gonna wow them.
Tonight, tequila pairing.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.734
- Awesome.
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

29:40.767 --> 29:42.500
We're gonna do caprese salad
with buffalo mozzarella,

29:42.500 --> 29:45.200
eggplant parmesan to follow
with Italian prosciutto

29:45.233 --> 29:46.633
and topped off with fresh basil.

29:46.633 --> 29:48.633
I think that this tequila
and this parmesan

29:48.633 --> 29:51.266
with the Italian sauce
will work well.

29:51.266 --> 29:53.533
Any problems, come find me.
We'll chat. Cool?

29:53.533 --> 29:56.266
- Great.
- We know where to find you.

29:56.266 --> 29:57.300
- It's fine, right?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.266
- You could still change it.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.100
- You just need to relax.
[laughter]

30:05.400 --> 30:07.266
- You know what I think?
- What?

30:07.266 --> 30:08.500
- I think you should tell us
what the hell you did

30:08.533 --> 30:10.667
last night; that's what I think.

30:10.667 --> 30:13.266
Ooh, you did [inaudible].

30:13.300 --> 30:15.266
- I think Jen has enough
to focus on

30:15.300 --> 30:18.400
that we shouldn't waste
any time talking about

30:18.400 --> 30:20.000
where I may have
slept last night.

30:20.033 --> 30:22.533
- Did you set sail?
- His mast never--

30:22.567 --> 30:23.767
- It was crooked and tiny?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
It's definitely unprofessional.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.667
You're supposed to set the tone
for me and to lead by example,

30:28.667 --> 30:30.500
so it's a tough place
for me to be in.

30:30.533 --> 30:33.166
- He did not raise the jib.
I don't--I don't sail.

30:33.166 --> 30:34.300
I'm a yachtie.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.567
- All right, over. Down.

30:41.467 --> 30:43.266
- Are you asking if we're really
getting tequila

30:43.300 --> 30:45.000
with eggplant parmesan?

30:45.033 --> 30:46.300
- Yeah, I'm gonna ask.
- Don't be a bitch.

30:46.333 --> 30:48.300
- Matt, is eggplant parmesan

30:48.300 --> 30:50.233
really gonna
go good with tequila?

30:53.433 --> 30:57.033
- Um, well, the tequila
then tomato that we have,

30:57.066 --> 30:59.333
the tomato sauce, um...

31:07.367 --> 31:08.033
- Is eggplant parmesan really

31:08.033 --> 31:08.433
- Is eggplant parmesan really
gonna go good with tequila?

31:11.166 --> 31:14.433
- Tomato sauce and the tequila
might go really well together.

31:14.467 --> 31:16.200
- Okay.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.300
- Is eggplant gonna pair
well with tequila?

31:19.333 --> 31:21.066
- Gonna go for it still?

31:21.100 --> 31:23.400
- F---.
- Some kind of Spanish?

31:23.433 --> 31:25.300
- Yeah, I'm thinking.

31:25.333 --> 31:26.734
- What do you call that Spanish
dish with the rice

31:26.734 --> 31:28.467
and the shrimp and the
bah-bah-bah-bah?

31:28.467 --> 31:30.300
- Paella.
- It's cool, too.

31:30.333 --> 31:32.066
It's, like, impressive.

31:32.066 --> 31:33.734
I don't know what part
of Canada Matt is from,

31:33.734 --> 31:36.400
but I think it's universally
known that tequila

31:36.433 --> 31:38.600
doesn't go well with eggplant.

31:38.600 --> 31:42.467
- I'm gonna do a red snapper
with Spanish rice.

31:42.467 --> 31:44.600
I mean, it's not a great feeling
having a charter guest come in

31:44.633 --> 31:46.600
and tell you you're sh--.

31:46.633 --> 31:48.200
I definitely feel like I'm
caught with my pants down here.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.734
I don't know much about tequila,

31:49.767 --> 31:52.467
but I have a beautiful
red snapper with Spanish rice.

31:52.467 --> 31:54.166
- Perfect.
- Cool.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.500
- Yeah. No, totally.
- It's a way better idea.

31:55.533 --> 31:57.467
No worries. Perfect.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.233
- How do you think
things are going?

31:59.266 --> 32:01.600
- I see progress with Bruno.

32:01.633 --> 32:03.600
Baker's still a little nervous.

32:03.633 --> 32:04.767
She gets rattled if it doesn't
just fall right in to place.

32:04.767 --> 32:06.633
Chris is still lost.

32:08.367 --> 32:10.166
- Did you have fun last night?
- Yes, I had fun.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.100
- That's what matters.
- You're not mad, though, right?

32:12.133 --> 32:13.300
- Of course not.
- Okay.

32:15.133 --> 32:17.233
It's really fun.
We put some soap in there.

32:17.266 --> 32:19.767
- It's all lubed up for us?
Perfect.

32:21.233 --> 32:22.500
- You got it?

32:26.734 --> 32:29.500
- Whoo!
- Ooh.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.100
- This is the funnest thing
ever.

32:31.100 --> 32:32.100
- 'Cause you have a boring life.

32:32.133 --> 32:34.767
- Whoo!
- Chris.

32:34.767 --> 32:36.633
Chris, two seconds. You saw
the tequilas we had, right?

32:36.633 --> 32:38.533
- Yep.

32:38.533 --> 32:39.667
- Which one would be best
to serve the red snapper with?

32:39.667 --> 32:41.533
- How are you seasoning it?

32:41.533 --> 32:43.667
- Spanish style, so, like,
with Spanish rice.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.533
- Probably the Anejo.

32:45.533 --> 32:47.633
- And we have a creamy
cheese caprese salad.

32:47.667 --> 32:50.000
- We a de blanco would go
with the salad.

32:50.033 --> 32:51.667
- Chris just knows his booze.

32:51.700 --> 32:54.266
- Top-shelf bartenders
make such a big difference.

32:54.266 --> 32:56.266
The bar usually
speaks to me, you know?

32:56.266 --> 32:58.000
I want to open
a tequila bar in Sweden.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.633
- My man.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.266
- Jen. Jen. Kate.

33:09.266 --> 33:10.567
Jen. Jen. Kate.

33:12.166 --> 33:15.066
- Kate's gonna start
screaming at me.

33:17.300 --> 33:19.133
- No. No.

33:19.166 --> 33:20.433
- Can I have a margarita?
- Yes.

33:20.433 --> 33:21.500
With salt or without
salt in there?

33:21.533 --> 33:23.300
- With salt.

33:23.300 --> 33:26.033
- Why did you take all of
the tequila up there?

33:26.033 --> 33:27.500
- I didn't take all of
the tequila up there.

33:27.533 --> 33:29.300
- Well, where
the heck is the Petron?

33:29.300 --> 33:30.700
- Well, if you move your arm,
I'll show you.

33:30.700 --> 33:32.567
- Ugh.
- Just use anything.

33:32.567 --> 33:34.300
The rest of the Cuervo,
use that. Here, use this.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.033
- Oh, there's tequila.
- Oh, there's tequila.

33:36.066 --> 33:38.433
- Cheap stuff.
- She said you use the Cuervo.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.033
- Look what you've done.

33:40.033 --> 33:42.033
- Such a little bitch.
[laughter]

33:42.066 --> 33:44.033
- Oh, shut up.
- You are.

33:44.066 --> 33:45.767
I'm just kidding. I love you.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.300
- Are you guys getting along
right now?

33:47.300 --> 33:49.033
This is cute.
- Isn't it?

33:49.033 --> 33:50.700
- She sucks at her job,
but she's hilarious.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.433
- It's insulting, and it's
definitely out of line.

33:56.433 --> 33:58.166
You shouldn't be saying things

33:58.200 --> 34:00.266
like that
in front of the charter guests.

34:00.300 --> 34:02.734
Those are fighting words,
little missy.

34:02.767 --> 34:05.000
- Oh, come on.

34:05.033 --> 34:09.066
I feel like the more Jen raises
the bar with her attitude,

34:09.100 --> 34:12.333
the more I can remind her
that she shouldn't.

34:12.333 --> 34:14.033
[laughs]

34:19.066 --> 34:20.433
- In yachting there's an old
saying that

34:20.467 --> 34:22.333
the charter guest
is always right.

34:22.333 --> 34:24.333
- Cheers to night number two.

34:24.333 --> 34:27.000
- In reality, they're wrong
about 99% of the time.

34:27.033 --> 34:29.200
In this case, I got to side
with the charter guests

34:29.200 --> 34:31.467
'cause tequila and eggplant,
terrible idea.

34:31.467 --> 34:33.066
The red snapper's
been seared, baked,

34:33.066 --> 34:34.700
and then lime juice,
lemon juice,

34:34.734 --> 34:36.533
and a tequila
is coming up. Enjoy.

34:36.567 --> 34:38.467
- This was a good call
to mix it up a little bit.

34:38.467 --> 34:41.200
- So here we have Petron Anejo.
- Mm.

34:41.233 --> 34:43.367
- Cheers. I love that.
- Whoo.

34:43.367 --> 34:45.500
- Perfect.
- They are loving it, Matt.

34:48.266 --> 34:50.500
- It's like Rice-A-Roni.
The San Francisco treat.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.233
- You're the San
Francisco treat.

34:52.266 --> 34:55.100
- No, girl, ten years ago.

34:55.100 --> 34:56.467
[laughter]

34:56.500 --> 34:58.066
- Good night.
- Bye, good night.

34:58.100 --> 35:01.500
- Leave a note
[inaudible] breakfast.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.467
- Everything was so amazing.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.233
- I've had enough tequila.

35:05.233 --> 35:08.633
I know my limits.
We did rage last night, so...

35:08.667 --> 35:10.266
- Good night.
- Good night.

35:17.533 --> 35:19.500
- How's Queen Kate over there?

35:19.500 --> 35:24.533
- So Kate told the guests
earlier that I sucked at my job.

35:24.533 --> 35:25.667
- No way.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.533
That sucks. I'm sorry.

35:27.567 --> 35:31.100
- I mean, if it happens again,
she should be sorry.

35:31.133 --> 35:32.333
- Yeah.

35:40.567 --> 35:42.266
- I'm gonna get drunk tonight.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.767
- You gonna f---ing
not nap tomorrow?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.667
- Nah, I'm probably
still gonna nap.

35:45.667 --> 35:48.133
- Yeah? Well, f---ing pack
your bags afterwards then.

35:48.133 --> 35:49.500
- [laughs]

35:49.533 --> 35:52.400
- All right, let's get started.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.133
- Copy, Cap.
Three shots in.

35:55.166 --> 35:56.667
Anchor's at the waterline
and pretty clean,

35:56.667 --> 35:59.667
so I'm gonna bring it home.

36:01.667 --> 36:04.400
- Last time for this.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.700
- We're ready to rock.

36:06.700 --> 36:08.266
- Ooh.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.633
- Amazing.

36:10.667 --> 36:12.266
So good.

36:15.033 --> 36:16.433
- We've got everybody
in position?

36:16.433 --> 36:18.166
- Yes, sir.
Bow's ready.

36:18.166 --> 36:19.667
We're gonna
go bow to stern, very front.

36:22.166 --> 36:23.567
Right here. Throw it.
Throw it. Throw it.

36:23.567 --> 36:25.033
- Ready?
- There you go.

36:25.066 --> 36:26.567
- Lock it in.
- Lock it on?

36:26.567 --> 36:29.033
Here, I got it.

36:29.066 --> 36:30.433
- Good job.

36:32.166 --> 36:33.700
- We don't want it to end.

36:33.734 --> 36:35.700
- Yay, a belt.

36:35.700 --> 36:39.033
- Powder your little noses
and get your asses out here.

36:39.033 --> 36:41.567
- I think not being able
to leave the dock is gonna have

36:41.567 --> 36:43.533
a huge impact on our tip.

36:43.567 --> 36:45.700
The only positive thing
out of this charter was Bruno

36:45.700 --> 36:48.166
being half naked on a table.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.600
- Pleasure.
The food was delicious.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.333
- Thank you.

36:51.333 --> 36:52.333
- Thanks so much, dude.
It was awesome.

36:52.333 --> 36:53.467
- Thank you so much.

36:53.500 --> 36:54.600
- Sir.
- Thank you, sir.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.333
- Thank you so much.

36:56.333 --> 36:58.200
We appreciate all of
the work you've done.

36:58.233 --> 37:00.300
Kind of got off to a rocky start
with not leaving the dock...

37:00.333 --> 37:01.734
- Yeah.

37:01.734 --> 37:03.533
- But you more than
made up for it.

37:03.567 --> 37:07.600
Bruno, special thanks to you
for such a good attitude,

37:07.600 --> 37:10.033
and just everyone, just that
everything was phenomenal,

37:10.066 --> 37:11.600
but here you go.
Appreciate it.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.433
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks, you guys.

37:13.467 --> 37:14.734
- Thank you so much.
- Be safe.

37:14.734 --> 37:18.400
- Okay, let's go to work.
- Mm.

37:18.433 --> 37:20.033
- So you're gonna be fridges
and pantries; you're gonna be

37:20.066 --> 37:22.700
[inaudible].
Ready? Break.

37:27.066 --> 37:29.133
- Everybody in
crew mess in five.

37:29.667 --> 37:31.633
Hi, guys.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.500
How'd you guys
think the charter went?

37:33.533 --> 37:35.600
- Amazing.
- I can see where

37:35.633 --> 37:37.333
a lot of improvement's been made

37:37.367 --> 37:40.500
in a short period
of time for most of you.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.367
Some of you still
aren't getting it.

37:44.633 --> 37:46.367
We had to make up a story

37:46.400 --> 37:47.500
because we couldn't
leave the dock

37:47.500 --> 37:48.600
because we were a man down.

37:48.633 --> 37:50.500
That's pretty pathetic.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.233
Tonight you're allowed
to go out.

37:52.233 --> 37:56.233
Tomorrow I want everybody
on deck 8:00 a.m.,

37:56.233 --> 37:58.066
and if I even think
that somebody's gonna

37:58.100 --> 37:59.500
decide to take a nap,

37:59.500 --> 38:01.100
as soon as they get up
from the nap,

38:01.133 --> 38:02.500
they're gonna pack
their f---ing bags,

38:02.500 --> 38:04.767
and they're gonna
get off the boat.

38:04.767 --> 38:06.233
$17,000.

38:06.233 --> 38:11.467
Split up,
it comes to $1,545.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.400
- Gracias.
I love that paper.

38:14.400 --> 38:19.266
Now, give me some cash.
I'm gonna go make it rain.

38:19.300 --> 38:21.133
- Praise Jesus. Let's go.

38:21.133 --> 38:26.000
Come on.
- Hallelujah.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.667
- Oh, is it a party?
- Yeah, it is a party.

38:28.667 --> 38:30.367
- We should put a lock
on your door.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.667
- We should put a lock
on your mouth.

38:31.667 --> 38:34.533
- Should put a lock on your
vagina.

38:34.533 --> 38:36.400
[laughter]

38:36.433 --> 38:38.367
- Just enjoy your glass of wine
before I yell at you.

38:43.133 --> 38:45.667
- Oh, those don't go with that.

38:45.700 --> 38:48.667
- Coming from a career
where I've had people

38:48.667 --> 38:51.367
that I've managed to now be
at the bottom of the ladder,

38:51.400 --> 38:53.700
it's definitely an adjustment
to say the least,

38:53.700 --> 38:57.166
so I'm ready to get off of
this boat and have a good time.

38:57.166 --> 39:00.100
Rowr. Yes.

39:01.066 --> 39:02.433
- Here we go.

39:02.467 --> 39:04.033
- Hey, what's wrong?

39:04.066 --> 39:05.433
- Nothing.
- You're in a bad mood.

39:05.467 --> 39:07.500
- I'm not in a bad mood.

39:07.533 --> 39:08.734
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

39:10.533 --> 39:12.200
- Oh!

39:18.700 --> 39:20.100
- Jen likes to drink.

39:21.166 --> 39:23.600
- Jen, nobody comes
between me and Jesus.

39:32.166 --> 39:32.367
- Shall we?

39:32.367 --> 39:32.567
- Shall we?
- We shall.

39:34.333 --> 39:41.300
[upbeat music]

39:41.333 --> 39:43.200
- Last charter, Bruno
stepped up a lot.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.333
He was doing everything
that I taught him how to do.

39:45.333 --> 39:47.500
He definitely deserves
a good night out.

39:57.100 --> 40:01.266
- That girl's got moves, huh?
It's, like, yep.

40:14.567 --> 40:16.300
- Jen likes to drink.

40:16.333 --> 40:19.367
[inaudible].
- [inaudible].

40:19.400 --> 40:21.000
- She drinks a lot
for a little girl.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.500
Oh, la-la-la-la.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.600
- She's insane.

40:34.767 --> 40:37.500
- Praise Jesus. Hallelujah.

40:37.533 --> 40:39.166
Hey.

40:41.133 --> 40:42.333
What's up?

40:49.233 --> 40:51.033
- Yes.

40:54.133 --> 40:56.233
- Never drink alone with Jesus.

40:56.233 --> 40:59.467
That's what my grandma
always said. Not really.

41:04.266 --> 41:05.433
- No.

41:17.700 --> 41:20.000
- Chris, I believe,
is definitely hoping

41:20.000 --> 41:22.033
for a connection with me.
Um...

41:28.133 --> 41:31.533
- Yep.

41:31.567 --> 41:33.367
A little awkward.

41:41.033 --> 41:43.300
- Most males are gonna
be attracted to Bri,

41:43.300 --> 41:45.166
but my confidence
is always super high,

41:45.200 --> 41:46.767
so I think that I have a shot

41:47.000 --> 41:49.367
if I continue making
my intentions clear.

41:50.467 --> 41:51.500
- I'll be back

42:07.734 --> 42:10.166
- I don't mind training you...

42:10.200 --> 42:12.700
- Ugh! I suck.

42:12.734 --> 42:15.400
- But, Jen, nobody comes
between me and Jesus.

42:18.066 --> 42:19.500
- I do too.

42:25.300 --> 42:26.734
God!

42:26.734 --> 42:28.400
- Next time on "Below Deck"...

42:28.433 --> 42:30.333
- This charter we have
eight girls

42:30.367 --> 42:32.066
getting together to get
sh--faced and have some fun.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.166
[together]
Whoo-hoo!

42:33.200 --> 42:34.266
- God, I hate that sound.

42:42.467 --> 42:43.600
- Afro looks good on you.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.533
- [laughs]

42:45.567 --> 42:47.333
- There's no doubt in my mind
that Kate is hazing me.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.066
- [laughs]

42:49.066 --> 42:50.066
- Sitting here doesn't mean
that I'm actually

42:50.100 --> 42:51.433
not doing anything.

42:51.467 --> 42:53.066
- It means you're
not doing much.

42:53.100 --> 42:54.467
- I can promise you
there's gonna be a change

42:54.500 --> 42:56.533
in the configuration
of this crew.

42:56.567 --> 42:58.133
- What the f--- are they doing?

43:00.600 --> 43:02.767
- Did we hit something?
- God damn it!

43:02.767 --> 43:05.734
