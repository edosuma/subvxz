WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.136
MAN: The US government

00:02.170 --> 00:04.872
is planning to attack
the Soviet Union.

00:04.905 --> 00:07.541
MAN #2: We have to prevent
innocent people
from getting hurt.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.744
ANNOUNCER: The Americans,
all new Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.182
ANNOUNCER: FX presents

00:14.215 --> 00:16.217
Feud: Bette and Joan.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.890
*

00:25.893 --> 00:28.028
NARRATOR: Dateline:
Hollywood, California.

00:28.062 --> 00:31.699
Tinseltown readies itself
for its grandest of nights.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.601
The Academy Awards.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.870
This year's Oscars promises
to be an absolute nail-biter

00:36.904 --> 00:39.173
between favorites
Lawrence of Arabia

00:39.207 --> 00:40.574
and The Music Man.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.210
But the real trouble
in River City,

00:42.243 --> 00:44.545
and the race everyone is
talking about

00:44.578 --> 00:46.013
is the contest to see

00:46.046 --> 00:48.682
who will be crowned
Best Actress.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.751
Here's icy beauty Lee Remick,

00:50.784 --> 00:54.355
nominated for her turn
as Jack Lemmon's boozy bride.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.358
Skipping the wine and sticking
to roses, Lee?

00:57.391 --> 00:59.427
Kooky Anne Bancroft,

00:59.460 --> 01:01.729
who brought her inimitable
Annie Sullivan to the screen

01:01.762 --> 01:04.098
in Arthur Penn's
The Miracle Worker,

01:04.132 --> 01:05.966
will be working
a miracle herself

01:05.999 --> 01:08.969
to make the curtain in her
latest Broadway triumph.

01:09.002 --> 01:12.573
Golden Globe winner Geraldine
Page out walking her pooch.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.109
Will Oscar follow
the Globe's lead

01:15.143 --> 01:17.445
and give Tennessee Williams'
latest muse

01:17.478 --> 01:19.413
Hollywood's highest honor?

01:19.447 --> 01:21.115
With her ninth nomination,

01:21.149 --> 01:23.251
screen legend Katharine Hepburn

01:23.284 --> 01:25.153
will not be making
a Long Day's Journey

01:25.186 --> 01:26.987
to the West Coast this year,

01:27.020 --> 01:29.823
as she plans once again
to sit out the festivities

01:29.857 --> 01:31.959
in her Connecticut hideaway.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.995
(reporters clamoring)
But all the Vegas oddsmakers

01:35.028 --> 01:36.797
say the smart money
is on Bette Davis.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.400
It's an honor just
to be nominated... again.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.302
Miss Davis, do you have any
comment on the Academy

01:41.335 --> 01:42.836
snubbing your costar,
Joan Crawford?

01:42.870 --> 01:46.340
Define "snub."
Next question.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.842
(reporters clamoring)
NARRATOR:
One thing's for sure:

01:48.876 --> 01:50.611
no matter who wins,
history will be made

01:50.644 --> 01:53.181
in three weeks
when Frank Sinatra

01:53.214 --> 01:55.716
hosts the 35th Academy Awards.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.121
*

02:30.584 --> 02:33.587
*

03:00.714 --> 03:03.717
(seagulls chirping,
waves crashing)

03:23.704 --> 03:26.674
OLIVIA:
The 1963 Oscars.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.742
I have to say

03:28.776 --> 03:31.044
that's when things took such
an ugly turn.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.080
Not that everything

03:33.113 --> 03:35.849
was sunshine and lollipops
up until then,

03:35.883 --> 03:39.019
but it was the Academy Awards
that year

03:39.052 --> 03:42.222
when it became
the point of no return

03:42.256 --> 03:44.258
for both Bette and Joan.

03:44.292 --> 03:47.194
I truly believed that the ladies

03:47.227 --> 03:51.732
would put aside their natural
personal enmity,

03:51.765 --> 03:54.568
but there were so many people
who profited

03:54.602 --> 03:57.070
from them being
at each other's throats.

03:57.104 --> 04:00.240
The studio,
the publicity people,

04:00.274 --> 04:02.876
and of course, the columnists.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.246
I know firsthand.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.116
Unscrupulous reporters
did everything they could

04:09.149 --> 04:11.919
to sow hatred

04:11.952 --> 04:14.822
between myself
and my own sister.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.324
The actress Joan Fontaine
is your younger sister?

04:16.357 --> 04:19.727
Well, she's not
that much younger, but yes.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.228
So there is no feud

04:21.261 --> 04:22.996
between you two?

04:23.030 --> 04:24.998
A feud implies

04:25.032 --> 04:27.335
continuing hostile conduct

04:27.368 --> 04:29.837
between two parties.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.505
I can't remember an instance

04:31.539 --> 04:34.475
where I instigated
hostile behavior.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.277
INTERVIEWER: You refused
to speak to her backstage

04:37.311 --> 04:38.912
after your 1947 Oscar win.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.514
OLIVIA:
You're referring

04:40.548 --> 04:44.352
to that photo of me
in Photoplay magazine.

04:44.385 --> 04:48.188
I wasn't turning my back
on my sister in that photo.

04:48.221 --> 04:51.692
I just didn't see
that she was there.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.761
It's hard to imagine

04:53.794 --> 04:57.164
the pressure the Academy Awards
puts on one.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.199
Which brings us back

04:59.232 --> 05:01.969
to Bette and the other Joan.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.171
Well, it all started,
I remember,

05:04.204 --> 05:05.939
with the nominations.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.709
And understandably,
Joan was hurt,

05:08.742 --> 05:10.778
because she was snubbed.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.646
Unfortunately, dear Bette,

05:12.680 --> 05:16.384
wasn't about to offer her
any solace.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.720
But Joan, being a fighter,

05:19.753 --> 05:23.123
wasn't about
to let one tiny detail

05:23.156 --> 05:26.660
like not being nominated
push her out of the limelight.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.631
The very day
of the nominations,

05:30.664 --> 05:33.834
Joan marched herself down
to the Motion Picture Academy

05:33.867 --> 05:36.837
and demanded to see
Mr. Wendell Corey,

05:36.870 --> 05:38.572
the president of the Academy.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.973
Mr. Corey.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.308
Joan Crawford's headed this way

05:41.341 --> 05:42.676
and she's not slowing down.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.819
Joan, I can promise you,

05:51.852 --> 05:54.354
the vote tally
is beyond reproach.

05:54.388 --> 05:57.491
The people at Price Waterhouse
are honest to a fault.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.927
Wendell, I'm confident
under your stewardship

05:59.960 --> 06:02.696
that everything here at the
Academy is above board.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.566
I wish all the
worthy nominees

06:05.599 --> 06:07.100
good luck
and Godspeed.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.537
I'm here to offer my services.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.573
As it turns out, I'm available
to present this year.

06:12.606 --> 06:16.276
Either Best Picture
or Best Director.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.278
You decide which.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.280
Oh, well, that's...

06:20.313 --> 06:22.115
that's very generous.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.518
Of course I'm going to require
a few things.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.620
I'd appreciate it

06:26.654 --> 06:28.889
if the Academy could pay
for my hair and makeup.

06:28.922 --> 06:32.960
And, of course, provide a car
and a chauffeur.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.096
Well, we don't do that
for presenters.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.535
You will for me.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.071
OLIVIA:
I believe if Bette had said

06:44.104 --> 06:46.039
to even one reporter

06:46.073 --> 06:49.276
that she regretted Joan
not getting a nod,

06:49.309 --> 06:52.145
all that unpleasantness
would have gone away.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.483
She came across as cold

06:55.516 --> 06:58.986
and unsympathetic to some,

06:59.019 --> 07:01.555
but really she was nervous.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.256
Terribly so.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.261
(phone rings)

07:08.295 --> 07:10.831
OPERATOR: Bonsoir. I have
a person-to-person call

07:10.864 --> 07:13.233
for Mademoiselle de Havilland
from Mademoiselle Davis.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.737
Oh. Yes, of course, operator.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.238
Bette.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.508
Livvie. I have no idea
what time it is there.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.009
Did I wake you?

07:22.042 --> 07:24.411
No, not at all.
I was just reading

07:24.444 --> 07:27.748
what passes as a script for
a new movie they've offered me.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.449
Anything in it for me?

07:29.483 --> 07:33.253
Not unless you want to play
a wino or a hoodlum.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.423
The title alone
makes me want to shudder.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.858
Lady in a Cage.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.326
(chuckles)

07:39.359 --> 07:41.595
Just sounds so awful.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.830
Awful!

07:42.863 --> 07:44.632
And if you don't
snap it up, I will.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.166
(both chuckle)

07:46.199 --> 07:48.268
I doubt very much indeed

07:48.301 --> 07:50.270
that it will bring you
your fourth Oscar.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.305
Don't jinx me,
I haven't won the third one yet.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.041
You will.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.843
In only a few weeks time, too.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.178
You know I'll be
pulling for you.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.714
Pulling for me? You're going
to be sitting right next to me.

08:00.748 --> 08:04.351
Oh, you can't really expect me
to travel all that way

08:04.384 --> 08:05.953
for an award show.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.321
You bet your ass I can.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.357
Oh, Livvie, you have no idea
what they've been saying

08:10.390 --> 08:12.526
about me in the press.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.394
About you and Joan, you mean.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.664
Christ, is it in
the French papers, too?

08:16.697 --> 08:19.032
In any language, all they want

08:19.066 --> 08:20.868
is a catfight.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.536
You have to stop
giving it to them.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.837
I know.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.373
I should be kinder,
I want to be,

08:26.406 --> 08:29.009
but she sets me off.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.578
I know the impulse well.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.246
But two words:

08:33.280 --> 08:35.716
"No... comment."

08:35.749 --> 08:39.086
Easy for you to say; my Joan
is far worse than your Joan.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.154
Not possible.

08:41.188 --> 08:45.392
You know what my bitch sister
has taken to telling the press?

08:45.425 --> 08:47.027
(chuckles)

08:47.060 --> 08:50.530
That I broke her collarbone
when we were children.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.866
(laughs)
Can you imagine?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.735
And the press...

08:54.768 --> 08:57.004
just gobbles it up.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.272
Monsters.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.441
Livvie, you have to come.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.043
The goddamn Hollywood press,

09:03.076 --> 09:04.912
they won't be able
to say shit about me

09:04.945 --> 09:06.580
if there's another woman
of comparable stature

09:06.614 --> 09:08.015
supporting me.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.718
Comparable to Joan's stature,
you mean.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.053
What else would I mean?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.855
OLIVIA:
Bette was never easy.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.425
But I know she respects me.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.728
We both have two Oscars,

09:20.761 --> 09:22.362
and she knew that
winning another one

09:22.395 --> 09:24.131
didn't matter that much to me,

09:24.164 --> 09:27.534
so I wasn't competition
to her, I suppose.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.936
I was never a threat.

09:28.969 --> 09:32.439
In her mind,
I was always Melanie Wilkes

09:32.472 --> 09:35.575
to her Scarlett O'Hara.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.845
Of course, I really was
Melanie Wilkes.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.086
Her third Oscar.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.588
You always did stink at math,
Joanie, not a third Oscar.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.124
Her tenth nomination,
her eighth loss.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.259
That's the way you got
to think of it.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.494
But she is the odds-on favorite.

09:54.527 --> 09:57.564
HEDDA: Well, that's because
this town loves nothing more

09:57.597 --> 09:58.799
than to bestow titles.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.167
And they're just itching

10:00.200 --> 10:01.835
to give that old nag
the triple crown.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.403
But we're going to see
she doesn't get it.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.304
How?

10:04.337 --> 10:06.439
Mm. Easy.

10:06.473 --> 10:09.677
There are, as of now,
655 Academy members

10:09.710 --> 10:14.314
in your peer group that'll be
casting a vote for Best Actress.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.150
We just have to get to,
say, 100 of them,

10:17.184 --> 10:18.752
and we can tip this thing.

10:18.786 --> 10:22.022
You mean actually lobby
the Academy members

10:22.055 --> 10:23.323
to vote against her?

10:23.356 --> 10:24.825
Why not?

10:24.858 --> 10:25.926
Well, because it
will be seen as

10:25.959 --> 10:27.795
sour grapes
on my part.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.597
And that's why you have
to stay squeaky clean.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.766
You let me poison the well.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.001
You're gonna serve up

10:34.034 --> 10:36.636
nothing but rainbows
and moonbeams.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.939
Get out your
phone book.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.174
We're gonna play a little game
I learned from Jack Webb,

10:41.208 --> 10:43.610
"Good cop, bad cop."

10:43.643 --> 10:46.513
I'll put the word
out on Davis.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.615
You plump up the
other nominees.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.952
Well, who do you think is
her closest competition?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.722
Well, they're not gonna give
it to that buzzard Hepburn.
Oh.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.990
She's never once showed
up to the ceremony.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.726
I'll bad-mouth her
a little bit, too.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.861
Her and those slacks.
(laughs)

11:00.894 --> 11:02.830
Remick's no threat; they
all still think of her

11:02.863 --> 11:04.564
as a television
actress.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.499
Push for Page or Bancroft.

11:06.533 --> 11:10.570
Lean on the "Hollywood reaches
out to Broadway" angle.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.707
One of them gets it,
it'll sting her even more.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.810
You hate her more than I do.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.212
I find her vulgar.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.581
Besides, she thinks
we're all hypocrites.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.683
Aren't we, though, Hedda?

11:23.717 --> 11:25.685
Well, of course we are,

11:25.719 --> 11:27.855
but I'm not gonna
be judged for it,

11:27.888 --> 11:30.057
not by her.

11:30.090 --> 11:35.095
Hypocrisy is the tribute
vice must pay to virtue.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.997
You've always understood that.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.698
She never has.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.567
The only reason

11:40.600 --> 11:43.771
the rest of the country allows
this Babylon to stay standing

11:43.804 --> 11:45.873
is because it believes
we have a conscience.

11:45.906 --> 11:49.209
And for 30 years,
I have been that conscience.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.511
And I gave up
everything for it.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.114
My career as an actress,
my marriage,

11:54.147 --> 11:56.583
my dream
of having many children.

11:56.616 --> 11:59.352
What has she sacrificed?
Nothing.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.255
Well, then,
let's make some calls.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.859
Chuck, it's Hedda.

12:05.893 --> 12:09.562
I just had to call and say
how much I loved you in El Cid,

12:09.596 --> 12:12.199
how I adore a man
in a leather skirt.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.735
Oh, I thank you, Doris.
That's very sweet of you.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.638
But I really wasn't
expecting one this year.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.775
Oh, but I was thrilled to see
Geraldine Page get nominated.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.110
Weren't you?

12:23.143 --> 12:24.711
Yes, a concussion.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.780
She kicked her
right in the head twice.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.715
Joan would have been well
within her rights

12:28.748 --> 12:30.483
to file assault charges.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.787
Well, I was lucky enough to see
Miss Bancroft play it onstage.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.455
And do you know, Loretta,

12:35.488 --> 12:39.659
her Annie Sullivan seemed
even more blind on-screen.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.128
Why should she have three?

12:41.161 --> 12:42.595
You know, the one they gave her

12:42.629 --> 12:44.631
for Dangerous
she uses as a doorstop?

12:44.664 --> 12:48.068
Mm. Her bathroom.
Can you believe it?

12:48.101 --> 12:52.139
That poor Oscar has to watch
that woman go to the toilet.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.908
No, Anne Bancroft is
absolutely brilliant.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.677
Love to you, Cary.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.080
It's no use.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.414
What are you
talking about?

13:01.448 --> 13:02.749
It's a fool's errand.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.484
She's already won.

13:04.517 --> 13:08.655
Joan.
No, I don't mean today
or on Oscar night.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.490
I have been in competition

13:10.523 --> 13:14.094
with that goddamn woman
my entire career.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.696
A constant battle.

13:16.729 --> 13:20.200
For men, for roles,
for magazine covers.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.336
And I don't know why.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.639
I was the bigger star.

13:26.673 --> 13:29.209
My leading men were
more attractive.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.678
My pictures made more money.

13:31.711 --> 13:36.316
And yet I was always
made to feel inferior.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.186
After years of
working so hard to be

13:39.219 --> 13:42.789
an ambassador for Hollywood,
to be part of this community,

13:42.822 --> 13:45.125
while she gives the
industry the finger

13:45.158 --> 13:47.294
from her moldy home
in Connecticut.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.830
And yet, when presented
with the opportunity,

13:50.864 --> 13:55.135
they nominate her...
instead of me.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.905
It's so fucking
humiliating.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.840
I think you've had enough
of that iced tea.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.276
No, I mean it, Hedda.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.846
Something inside me broke

14:06.880 --> 14:08.916
when they announced
those nominations.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.718
Not because I was
counting on it

14:11.751 --> 14:13.653
or because I hoped
that it would ensure

14:13.686 --> 14:15.555
a few more precious
years of work.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.558
It was beyond that.

14:18.591 --> 14:24.197
Whatever self-confidence
I had left was gone.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.934
She leeched it out of me!

14:26.967 --> 14:29.236
Hmm.

14:29.269 --> 14:33.840
Oh, God, I can't believe I said
I would present at those awards.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.575
I don't know what I
was thinking. I can't

14:35.608 --> 14:37.344
go to that awards show.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.746
I can't show my
face anymore.

14:39.779 --> 14:43.250
Joan, you are going
to those awards.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.919
We can get you
your self-confidence back.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.420
I don't see how.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.522
I'll tell you how.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.858
She may have been the one
who was nominated,

14:51.891 --> 14:54.227
but as God as my witness,

14:54.261 --> 14:59.399
that woman is not going
to walk off that stage

14:59.432 --> 15:01.901
with the Oscar
for Best Actress,

15:01.935 --> 15:04.904
because you are.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.748
(lively jazz playing,
phone ringing)

15:18.785 --> 15:21.154
Well, gee, don't
get up or anything.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.092
Hello.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.159
JOAN:
Gerry?

15:26.193 --> 15:28.595
Is this Miss Geraldine Page?

15:28.628 --> 15:30.797
It is. Rip, turn that down.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.132
I can't hear.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.434
This is Joan Crawford, dear,

15:34.467 --> 15:37.237
calling from Hollywood,
California.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.107
It's Joan fucking Crawford.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.510
Gerry?

15:43.543 --> 15:47.914
Miss Crawford,
how may I help you?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.983
I just want to say
right up front

15:50.017 --> 15:51.584
that I was not upset.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.286
Upset?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.355
Why would you be upset?

15:55.388 --> 15:57.324
With the performance
you were nominated for

15:57.357 --> 15:58.791
in Sweet Bird of Youth.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.360
(laughs)

16:00.393 --> 16:02.762
The faded movie queen
swanning about.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.331
Oh, I think we

16:04.364 --> 16:06.633
all know
who that was based on, dear.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.501
Oh, no, Miss Crawford.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.138
Mr. Williams created that role.
I was just...

16:11.171 --> 16:12.672
No, I was flattered, Gerry.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.374
Really I was.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.876
You got it so close to perfect.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.712
Although I would never
date a man under 40.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.982
Not enough money to keep
this lady happy. (laughs)

16:23.016 --> 16:24.117
Uh-huh.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.586
What does she want?

16:28.355 --> 16:30.890
Was there something you needed,
Miss Crawford?

16:30.923 --> 16:34.694
No, I just wanted
to say congratulations, Gerry.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.630
I mean, with so many wonderful
performances this year

16:37.664 --> 16:39.699
and only five nominations,

16:39.732 --> 16:42.969
I was so glad
to see you get recognized.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.072
Thank you.

16:45.105 --> 16:48.175
Can you believe
it's only two weeks away,

16:48.208 --> 16:51.010
and I haven't even cut out
potatoes yet.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.145
Potatoes?

16:52.179 --> 16:54.514
Those television cameras

16:54.547 --> 16:56.316
are many times more punishing

16:56.349 --> 16:58.518
than the motion picture
cameras.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.653
Who's doing your gown?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.655
My gown?

17:02.689 --> 17:05.858
I hadn't really thought
about my gown.

17:05.892 --> 17:08.027
Well, of course,
you have many fine options

17:08.061 --> 17:10.197
out there in New York.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.066
But you want to be fitted here
the day of.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.235
May I suggest Edith Head?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.837
Really,
there is no one better, dear.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.873
I could speak to her for you,
and then, if you like,

17:20.907 --> 17:24.010
I could personally help you
select your jewels.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.179
That is awfully generous of
you, Miss Crawford, really,

17:26.213 --> 17:28.548
but I think I'm gonna
try and keep it simple.

17:28.581 --> 17:29.949
Don't forget, Gerry.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.119
You're representing Hollywood.

17:32.152 --> 17:36.456
I mean, this broadcast will be
seen all over the world.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.759
People depend on us
to brighten their ordinary lives

17:39.792 --> 17:41.294
with a little glamour.

17:41.328 --> 17:44.097
Well, if their lives
depend on my glamour,

17:44.131 --> 17:46.166
I've got some
bad news for them.

17:48.601 --> 17:52.939
Well... it really is
too stressful, isn't it,

17:52.972 --> 17:54.574
dear?

17:54.607 --> 17:56.909
Lord knows
the year I was nominated

17:56.943 --> 17:58.645
for Mildred Pierce, I was

17:58.678 --> 18:00.413
too nervous to attend.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.149
No, I stayed home
and faked pneumonia.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.583
(laughs)

18:03.616 --> 18:05.452
And do you know what?

18:05.485 --> 18:09.055
They brought the Oscar to me.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.192
And in a way, it was more
intimate, more of an honor.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.764
Is that what you think
I should do?

18:17.797 --> 18:20.367
Stay home?

18:22.169 --> 18:24.171
Well, I could accept it for you.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.605
(exhales)

18:25.638 --> 18:27.274
It's just down
the road from me,

18:27.307 --> 18:29.108
and I have to be there anyway.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.777
I'll say lovely things,

18:30.810 --> 18:34.013
and you can watch
from the comfort

18:34.046 --> 18:37.016
of your New York one-bedroom.

18:37.049 --> 18:40.153
(sighing):
Oh.

18:40.187 --> 18:43.122
Sure... Miss Crawford.

18:43.156 --> 18:46.793
You are welcome to accept
the award on my behalf.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.828
Really?

18:50.397 --> 18:53.200
Well, if that's what you want.
(laughs)

18:53.233 --> 18:56.369
Just send me a list
of people to thank.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.938
Let's try to keep it
to three names.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.141
Short and sweet, in my opinion,
is the best.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.778
I will do that.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.215
Wonderful.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.650
All my love to you, Gerry.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.051
Miss Crawford?

19:12.084 --> 19:14.354
(click, dial tone)

19:18.858 --> 19:21.194
Well...

19:21.228 --> 19:23.162
good news.

19:24.697 --> 19:27.234
I'm not going to make you
put on a tux this year.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.569
You're actually gonna let
that high-strung show pony

19:29.602 --> 19:31.170
represent you at the Oscars?

19:33.206 --> 19:36.209
Well, she needs it.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.346
And besides,

19:39.379 --> 19:42.014
Hollywood should be
forced to look

19:42.048 --> 19:44.351
at what they've done to her.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.786
(upbeat jazz playing)

19:50.290 --> 19:52.759
(song ends)

20:04.471 --> 20:06.873
(distant horn toots,
whistle blowing)

20:06.906 --> 20:09.276
(brakes squeak)

20:10.610 --> 20:12.379
(car horn blowing)

20:12.412 --> 20:14.814
(distant siren blaring)

20:18.718 --> 20:20.219
(horn honking)

20:20.253 --> 20:21.621
(door opens)

20:21.654 --> 20:23.290
LYDIA:
Annie,

20:23.323 --> 20:24.724
you have a visitor.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.559
Joan Crawford.

20:26.593 --> 20:29.529
Joan Crawford caught
the performance?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.731
Sure. Pull the other one, Lydia.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.199
I'm serious.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.601
She's right outside the door.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.040
Well, hell, show her in.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.443
(distant chatter)

20:47.113 --> 20:48.948
Miss Crawford.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.383
What an honor.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.051
I just had to pop back

20:52.084 --> 20:55.087
and tell you what
an astonishing performance

20:55.121 --> 20:57.757
you gave tonight,
and to a half-empty house.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.393
That really is dedication.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.261
Well, thank you.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.263
You theater gals.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.465
(clicks tongue)

21:05.498 --> 21:07.066
I don't know how you do it.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.169
Night after night, weekends,

21:10.202 --> 21:11.671
matinees.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.741
Oh, it must be terribly
taxing on your voice.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.643
I drink a lot of tea.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.078
Smart. (laughs)

21:19.111 --> 21:21.981
I was so looking forward
to seeing you next week

21:22.014 --> 21:23.850
at the Academy Awards.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.819
But I read in
Dorothy Kilgallen's column

21:26.853 --> 21:28.955
that you won't be attending?

21:28.988 --> 21:30.590
I'm afraid not. I can't.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.291
I'd have to miss
three performances,

21:32.325 --> 21:33.826
and I just couldn't do that

21:33.860 --> 21:35.695
to the people who paid
to see the show.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.630
It's either the work
or the reward, you know.

21:37.664 --> 21:41.468
So you're not mad
at our little movie colony?

21:41.501 --> 21:45.137
I know they gave
that Shirley MacLaine

21:45.171 --> 21:47.940
your part
in Two for the Seesaw.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.309
Well, I heard that movie stank.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.679
To high heaven. (laughs)

21:52.712 --> 21:54.213
Good. (laughs)

21:54.246 --> 21:56.383
Can I offer you a drink?

21:56.416 --> 22:00.152
No, no, no, no.
Please, let me get it.

22:01.988 --> 22:06.192
I also understand
that you have requested

22:06.225 --> 22:10.196
young Patty Duke to accept
your prize should you win.

22:10.229 --> 22:13.165
Yeah, but because
she's nominated, too,

22:13.199 --> 22:15.668
the Academy put the
kibosh on that idea.

22:15.702 --> 22:18.304
Well, that seems silly.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.373
It's probably for
the best, though.

22:20.407 --> 22:23.342
What if I were to win for
Best Actress, and Patty lost

22:23.376 --> 22:24.744
for Supporting?

22:24.777 --> 22:26.379
I'd hate to put the kid
through that.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.215
But, between you and me,

22:29.248 --> 22:31.217
I think she's going to win.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.653
Yes, I think she is, too.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.823
And my sixth sense tells me

22:36.856 --> 22:39.426
that you are going
to win also.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.260
Wouldn't that be something?

22:41.293 --> 22:42.995
Yes, it certainly would.

22:43.029 --> 22:46.433
The blind leading
the blind.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.746
Miss Crawford...

23:02.949 --> 23:04.684
...did you fly all the way here
to ask

23:04.717 --> 23:06.953
if you could accept my award
for me?

23:06.986 --> 23:10.389
No. No, but I certainly would be
happy to...

23:10.423 --> 23:13.760
But would it make you happy?

23:18.431 --> 23:20.933
Desperately.

23:22.134 --> 23:25.605
Well, then I really hope
I do win.

23:25.638 --> 23:29.375
I'd be honored to have
someone of your stature

23:29.408 --> 23:31.811
accept on my behalf.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.150
Thank you.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.754
I'm sorry.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.089
I really must go now.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.391
I have a dinner engagement
in an hour.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.959
It was lovely to meet you,
Miss Crawford.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.461
Yes, and you, too.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.997
Thank you.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.466
Joan?

23:53.500 --> 23:55.935
Hmm?

23:55.968 --> 23:59.171
Davis may have had
the flashier role,

23:59.205 --> 24:02.809
but you made that movie work.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.845
I really admired what you did.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.827
(doorbell rings)

24:20.860 --> 24:21.828
*

24:21.861 --> 24:23.596
MAMACITA:
Good.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.265
The jewels and the gown have
been approved by Miss Crawford.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.801
You know where
to carefully lay them out.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.839
Upstairs. She just woke up.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.407
Move, move, move.
Do not speak, just work.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.811
(door shuts)

24:38.845 --> 24:40.980
That goes for everyone here.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.683
Do not address Miss Crawford
unless she speaks to you first.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.951
And pick up the pace.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.219
It is Oscar day.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.121
BETTE:
"Dearest Bette,

24:49.155 --> 24:51.658
"good luck tonight.
You deserve to win.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.626
Jack Warner."

24:53.660 --> 24:56.028
"Bette, take home the gold.

24:56.062 --> 24:58.698
"We are so proud of you.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.533
Ronnie and Nancy Reagan."

25:00.567 --> 25:01.968
Oh.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.903
You're a shoo-in
to win, Miss Davis.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.171
Everybody thinks so.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.574
So it seems.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.682
JOAN: Edith Head gave me this
idea. Everything in silver.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.216
Like a silver Oscar.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.185
I think silver's

25:19.218 --> 25:20.853
so much more elegant than gold,
don't you?

25:20.887 --> 25:22.689
Did you know

25:22.722 --> 25:25.324
Edith already has seven Oscars?

25:25.357 --> 25:26.926
And you have two?

25:26.959 --> 25:28.695
Not yet.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.096
MAMACITA:
Okay,

25:30.129 --> 25:31.564
time to go.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.066
Hair.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.736
*

25:41.273 --> 25:43.643
*

25:54.754 --> 25:57.757
*

26:18.110 --> 26:20.079
How do I look?

26:20.112 --> 26:21.480
(chuckles)

26:21.513 --> 26:23.983
You look
beautiful.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.485
Like the first frost of fall.

26:26.518 --> 26:29.088
Like Sonja Henie
in one of those...

26:29.121 --> 26:31.257
winter wonderland
skating pictures.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.825
Very funny.

26:32.859 --> 26:36.428
Mr. Cukor,
will you do the honors?

26:36.462 --> 26:38.464
With pleasure.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.639
You are one of my
oldest friends.

26:46.673 --> 26:50.076
We have known each
other for 40 years,

26:50.109 --> 26:52.812
and I have never
bullshitted you.

26:52.845 --> 26:55.815
Now, there's something
I want to say to you,

26:55.848 --> 26:57.349
and you need to listen.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.220
Don't do this.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.123
Do what?

27:04.156 --> 27:07.093
Try and take it from her.

27:07.126 --> 27:10.697
The night.

27:10.730 --> 27:15.534
It'll be seen in all quarters
for exactly what it is:

27:15.567 --> 27:19.005
a petty act of revenge
from a woman scorned.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.677
(sighs) If she doesn't win,
you'll get bad press.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.445
Better than no press.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.280
These people will never work
with you again.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.182
Davis, Aldrich...

27:30.216 --> 27:31.450
Good.

27:31.483 --> 27:35.221
Joanie, you're bigger than this.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.664
No, I'm not.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.247
Christ, you always
look better than me.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.015
(chuckles)
Drink?

28:03.049 --> 28:04.350
Let's get one there.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.352
Our chariot awaits.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.354
Bette, what happened
to this one?

28:08.387 --> 28:10.189
Did all the gold plating
fall off?

28:10.222 --> 28:12.524
(chuckles)
Rubbed off, you mean.

28:12.558 --> 28:15.762
Every night when I watch
television in bed, I hold it.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.596
He's the perfect
companion.

28:17.629 --> 28:19.832
He doesn't talk
back. He listens.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.768
He's patient.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.439
And sometimes,

28:27.473 --> 28:29.942
when I need it,

28:29.976 --> 28:33.245
he reminds me
of that perfect night

28:33.279 --> 28:35.748
when I won him...

28:35.782 --> 28:37.784
and the whole world...

28:39.786 --> 28:43.289
stood up and cheered.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.657
And I was loved.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.631
God, that's sad.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.368
Actually,

28:56.402 --> 28:59.738
as a woman heading toward
her second divorce,

28:59.772 --> 29:01.808
I get it.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.410
I get it completely.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.746
(kisses)

29:07.780 --> 29:09.248
Let me visit
the powder room

29:09.281 --> 29:11.417
and we'll be on our way.

29:18.825 --> 29:21.760
Wait up for me, boys.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.964
Tonight I'm bringing you home
a baby brother.

29:45.051 --> 29:48.520
NARRATOR:
The Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences presents...

29:48.554 --> 29:51.557
its 35th annual
achievement awards.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.963
These people, like most of us,
are movie fans.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.998
They've come from
all over the country,

29:59.031 --> 30:01.800
here to the Pacific Auditorium
in Santa Monica, California,

30:01.834 --> 30:04.803
to get a glimpse
of their favorite movie actors,

30:04.837 --> 30:06.438
as the most famous faces
in the world

30:06.472 --> 30:10.209
arrive to attend
Oscar's coming out party.

30:11.677 --> 30:14.346
Look, there's Jack Lord
of Stoney Burke.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.548
(reporters clamoring)

30:16.582 --> 30:18.584
Eva Marie Saint.

30:20.152 --> 30:23.122
There's little Patty Duke.

30:23.155 --> 30:26.125
There's Lee Remick
with husband Bill Colleran.

30:26.158 --> 30:30.662
There's Bob Stack
and Mrs. Stack.

30:30.696 --> 30:34.066
And Gregory Peck, a nominee
for his work this year

30:34.100 --> 30:36.903
as Atticus Finch
in To Kill a Mockingbird.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.638
And there's Miss Bette Davis,

30:39.671 --> 30:41.640
nominated tonight
for her performance

30:41.673 --> 30:44.043
in What Ever Happened
to Baby Jane?

30:44.076 --> 30:46.512
REPORTER: Miss de Havilland,
is is true you flew out

30:46.545 --> 30:50.149
from Paris to present the award
for Best Picture?

30:50.182 --> 30:53.419
I will present that award,
but I traveled here

30:53.452 --> 30:56.255
to be with my dear
friend, Bette.

30:56.288 --> 31:01.227
I'm here to see her be the first
actress to win three Oscars.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.095
She's the greatest.
(laughs)

31:03.129 --> 31:05.864
And the industry
owes her this.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.866
What do you say to that,
Miss Davis?

31:07.900 --> 31:12.504
I'm not ashamed to admit
I want this.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.772
(crowd cheering)

31:13.805 --> 31:15.908
NARRATOR: There's screen legend
Joan Crawford.

31:15.942 --> 31:18.610
She'll be presenting the Oscar
tonight for Best Director.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.380
REPORTER:
Miss Crawford, Miss Crawford.

31:21.413 --> 31:24.416
Your Baby Jane costar,
Bette Davis,

31:24.450 --> 31:26.452
is nominated
for Best Actress tonight.

31:26.485 --> 31:29.188
Who did you vote for?

31:29.221 --> 31:30.622
The winner.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.395
(women laughing)

31:40.967 --> 31:44.870
*

31:44.903 --> 31:46.805
Set the cold cuts right there

31:46.838 --> 31:47.940
on that table.

31:47.974 --> 31:49.775
Get that vodka open

31:49.808 --> 31:51.377
for the guests.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.411
What about
the centerpiece?

31:52.444 --> 31:53.345
Just move it.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.282
Miss Crawford.

31:56.315 --> 31:57.916
Stan,

31:57.950 --> 32:00.286
how lovely to see you.
How are Judy and the children?

32:00.319 --> 32:02.321
Miss Crawford, I'm
sorry, but you cannot

32:02.354 --> 32:04.090
turn the greenroom
into your own

32:04.123 --> 32:06.492
private party.
It's against Academy bylaws.

32:06.525 --> 32:07.459
Light me.

32:15.968 --> 32:16.969
Drink.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.705
Have a lovely evening.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.075
Mamacita,

32:23.109 --> 32:25.044
touch up.

32:28.114 --> 32:31.583
PRESENTER: Now, the nominees
for Best Achievement

32:31.617 --> 32:33.785
in Art Direction
for a Color Production are...

32:33.819 --> 32:35.821
Oh, Jesus Christ, this night.

32:37.223 --> 32:40.859
What a fool, to care about
anything this much or want

32:40.892 --> 32:41.860
anything this much.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.862
Hey, Bette, sit down.

32:43.895 --> 32:45.497
Meredith Willson's Music Man.

32:45.531 --> 32:46.932
Look at me.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.934
Art direction by Paul Groesse.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.336
Take a breath.

32:50.369 --> 32:53.172
You are going to win.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.607
(sighs)
The crown is yours.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.842
And so is the record.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.810
...by George W. Davis...

32:58.844 --> 33:01.380
What did I ever do
to deserve you?

33:01.413 --> 33:03.649
(chuckles softly)
When we were young,

33:03.682 --> 33:06.352
you were one of the first
to make me feel

33:06.385 --> 33:08.387
I was more than a pretty face.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.657
You showed me how to fight.

33:11.690 --> 33:15.561
And, boy, did you fight for me
at the beginning of my career.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.697
And now here you are,

33:18.730 --> 33:21.200
fighting for me
at the end of mine.

33:21.233 --> 33:24.002
Oh, don't be so maudlin.

33:24.036 --> 33:26.238
Here we are at the top
of Mount Olympus,

33:26.272 --> 33:28.474
and all you want to do
is jump off.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.342
This is supposed to be
a celebration.

33:30.376 --> 33:34.012
Well, then, where's the booze?

33:34.046 --> 33:36.148
I think Frank
must've drunk it all.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.217
Come on, then.
Let's go to the greenroom

33:38.250 --> 33:41.887
and get ourselves some
proper swamp water.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.790
You don't want to go there.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.697
Why not?

33:53.699 --> 33:56.068
(indistinct chatter)

34:06.412 --> 34:08.447
JOAN:
My goodness,

34:08.480 --> 34:11.683
an Oscar winner at 17.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.419
The only way to go is down.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.254
So, then, you are

34:15.287 --> 34:17.089
the youngest
Academy Award winner

34:17.123 --> 34:18.757
in history, is that right?

34:18.790 --> 34:19.958
That's what they tell me.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.293
(chuckles)

34:21.327 --> 34:23.895
What's your pup's name?
Bambi.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.030
She's my good luck charm.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.265
Well, I'll say.

34:26.298 --> 34:27.933
(both chuckle)

34:27.966 --> 34:29.101
You know, dear,

34:29.135 --> 34:30.802
it isn't ladylike

34:30.836 --> 34:33.405
to bring a pet
to the Academy Awards.

34:33.439 --> 34:34.573
(gasps)

34:34.606 --> 34:35.941
PRESENTER:
The winner...

34:35.974 --> 34:38.577
is France
for Sundays and Cybele.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.412
(applause)

34:57.996 --> 35:01.600
Good luck.

35:04.136 --> 35:06.338
Miss Crawford? Your
category is next.

35:06.372 --> 35:07.739
Best Director?
You're presenting?

35:07.773 --> 35:10.409
Oh, yes. Thank you.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.643
Right this way.

35:16.382 --> 35:18.350
(applause)

35:28.394 --> 35:31.930
How much longer
till my category?

35:31.963 --> 35:33.599
Best Actress?

35:33.632 --> 35:35.901
About ten minutes.

35:48.079 --> 35:52.184
(orchestra plays)

36:03.562 --> 36:05.831
The nominees

36:05.864 --> 36:08.667
for Best Achievement
in Directing are:

36:26.218 --> 36:28.287
Please.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.330
