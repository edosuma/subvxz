00:02.915 --> 00:05.092
You know, I don'’t really think
about drinking much anymore,

00:05.179 --> 00:06.702
but I got to tell you,

00:06.789 --> 00:08.921
I was on a date
last weekend, and... oof,

00:09.009 --> 00:10.836
this girl was such a whack-job,

00:10.923 --> 00:12.664
it'’s a miracle
I didn'’t start shooting heroin

00:12.751 --> 00:14.144
before the salad showed up.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.754
[laughter]

00:15.841 --> 00:19.106
[quietly]: Hey, he'’s
talking about me!

00:19.193 --> 00:21.456
Even funnier.

00:22.631 --> 00:23.936
I mean, I think I spent

00:24.024 --> 00:25.503
the entire night
listening to her complain

00:25.590 --> 00:27.201
about her nightmare of a mother.

00:27.288 --> 00:28.985
[laughs]

00:31.074 --> 00:33.816
LEE: I know we'’re not
supposed to judge anybody here,

00:33.903 --> 00:35.948
but whoever'’s sponsoring
this girl

00:36.036 --> 00:38.299
isn'’t qualified
to sponsor a bowling team.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.608
Anyway, thanks.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.612
All right,
who'’d like to share next?

01:08.242 --> 01:11.071
Well, that'’s it. We are gonna
have to find a new meeting.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.333
Shake it off.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.857
Shake it off? I was humiliated.

01:14.944 --> 01:17.207
Why would you talk
about me on your dates?

01:19.209 --> 01:22.604
I think they have a right
to know why I'’m so broken.

01:24.432 --> 01:26.564
The point is we can'’t
go back to that meeting.

01:26.651 --> 01:29.872
No, the point is don'’t
date men in the rooms.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.787
Where else am I
supposed to meet them?

01:31.874 --> 01:34.355
You told me not to screw around
at the restaurant.

01:34.442 --> 01:37.967
No, I told you stop sleeping
with your married boss.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.448
That still leaves you

01:40.535 --> 01:43.842
all those single
dishwashers and busboys.

01:43.929 --> 01:46.106
That'’s tough;
they all live together.

01:48.325 --> 01:51.676
There'’s plenty of other
places to meet nice fellas.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.678
We should all
go out together.

01:53.765 --> 01:57.508
Your mom and I can
be your wing-gals.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.162
"Wing-gals"?

01:59.249 --> 02:01.164
Did I say it wrong?

02:01.251 --> 02:03.558
Perfect.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.255
That'’s not a bad idea.

02:05.342 --> 02:07.257
How about tomorrow night?

02:07.344 --> 02:09.520
Roscoe'’s gonna be with his dad,
and Violet'’s gonna be...

02:09.607 --> 02:12.915
I don'’t know. Wherever she
tells me, it'’ll be a lie.

02:13.002 --> 02:15.047
Tomorrow'’s no good;
I have plans with your dad.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.528
Oh. Okay.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.400
All right, Marjorie,
it'’s just us.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.402
No, honey,
it'’s just you.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.230
I have a date
with Victor.

02:23.317 --> 02:24.579
Who'’s Victor?

02:24.666 --> 02:26.189
Your old landlord,
Mr. Perugian.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.714
That'’s still happening?

02:29.801 --> 02:31.542
Yeah, kind of.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.544
He drove me to
chemo last Tuesday,

02:33.631 --> 02:37.026
so you might say
things are heating up.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.160
Hey, you could
still go out, though.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.422
Call another friend.

02:41.509 --> 02:44.599
Yeah. Yeah, I'’ll do that.

02:44.686 --> 02:45.643
Who are you thinking?

02:45.730 --> 02:47.036
I don'’t know.

02:47.123 --> 02:50.300
Phoebe, Monica, Rachel.

02:53.738 --> 02:56.611
Those were the girls
on Friends.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.700
Were they?

02:58.787 --> 03:01.006
That'’s weird.

03:01.093 --> 03:03.618
LEE: And then she tells me
she'’s a maitre d'’

03:03.705 --> 03:05.620
at this fancy restaurant
'’cause she'’s too embarrassed

03:05.707 --> 03:07.709
to say she'’s a waitress.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.624
Fine! We get it!

03:09.711 --> 03:11.278
I'’m a loser,
I'’m a liar,

03:11.365 --> 03:13.758
I'’m a whack-job!

03:17.632 --> 03:20.461
Okay, now we need to find
a new coffee shop.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.206
Roscoe leave?

03:26.293 --> 03:28.425
Yep. Baxter just
picked him up.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.166
Hey, you look nice.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.167
Thank you.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.517
You look... comfortable.

03:33.604 --> 03:35.389
I am.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.521
I thought you were gonna get
out there and meet people.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.393
You know, I was,

03:39.480 --> 03:42.091
but then I got to thinking,
I never have time to myself.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.701
I need to take advantage of it.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.095
So you'’re gonna masturbate.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.796
I call it "making love."

03:51.883 --> 03:53.842
Okay, well, have fun.

03:53.929 --> 03:54.973
I will. You, too.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.497
Christy?
Yeah?

03:56.584 --> 03:58.368
Keep it on your side of the bed.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.113
Okay.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.115
A whole night to myself.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.161

This is delicious, Alvin.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.056
Thank you.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.536
When did you learn to cook?

05:19.623 --> 05:21.538
Couple years ago,
I took some classes.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.279
Really? What inspired that?

05:23.366 --> 05:25.368
My wife and I weren'’t
getting along real well,

05:25.455 --> 05:26.717
and I was hungry.

05:26.804 --> 05:27.718

05:27.805 --> 05:31.069
Oh, you poor baby.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.419

05:32.506 --> 05:33.985
Ooh, what'’s that?

05:34.072 --> 05:36.423
Chilled whipped cream,
a sprig of mint

05:36.510 --> 05:39.556
and my world-famous nuts.

05:42.211 --> 05:44.996
Then I should probably skip
these little potatoes.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.999
[phone vibrating]

05:48.086 --> 05:50.001
Excuse me.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.829
No.

just come up on your phone?

Okay.

06:14.112 --> 06:16.288
Lorraine, yeah.

watching the game.

06:20.815 --> 06:23.034
What can I do for you?

06:23.121 --> 06:25.254
No.

06:25.341 --> 06:27.474
It'’s not my house anymore,
which means it'’s not my roof,

06:27.561 --> 06:29.563
which means it'’s
not my leak.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.565
No, I can'’t come
there right now.

06:31.652 --> 06:32.957
No, I'’m not
with anybody.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.830
I told you, I'’m
watching the game.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.833

06:38.920 --> 06:40.791

I'’ll e-mail you the
number of the roofer.

06:43.011 --> 06:45.100
Good-bye.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.102
So sorry about that.

06:54.544 --> 06:55.502
Sorry about that.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.634
No, it'’s fine, no worries.

06:57.721 --> 07:00.332
So how are you enjoying
being a building manager?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.378
Well, what'’s not to enjoy?

07:02.465 --> 07:05.337
We live rent-free,
and 67 people think of me

07:05.425 --> 07:06.817
every time
they successfully flush.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.518
Why did you tell Godzilla
you were alone?

07:11.605 --> 07:13.084
Lorraine?

07:13.171 --> 07:14.303
Why stir the pot?

07:14.390 --> 07:16.348
I get that.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.307
Does she know
we'’re seeing each other?

how the laundry goes.

All righty.

laundry on a Saturday night,

08:20.717 --> 08:23.024
but why is a beautiful woman
like you here?

08:23.111 --> 08:24.852
Oh, please.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.810
Beautiful.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.641
Just I'’m having
a little quality me time.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.298
Well, if you like,
I can do my laundry later.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.692
No, no, that'’s fine.You sure?

08:38.779 --> 08:40.476
Oh, yeah.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.304
I'’ve had enough me time.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.261
In fact, I'’m kind of sick of me.

08:45.873 --> 08:49.790
So you got anything exciting
to wash tonight?

08:49.877 --> 08:50.921
Um, not really.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.532
Mostly just underwear.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.055
Boxer man, huh?

08:54.142 --> 08:55.970
Yeah, ever since I was a kid.

08:58.059 --> 08:59.669

to the boxers

that extra ventilation...

just said yes?
