an arts commune.

00:05.656 --> 00:07.656
- What a magical place.

00:07.658 --> 00:09.958

- It's okay,

00:11.762 --> 00:13.062
he's a friend of mine.

- His real name is Ezra,
not Eddie.

- Is that true?
- Which part?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.333
- You are pathetic.

00:18.335 --> 00:20.602
- Ezra, you have to call
your parents.

00:20.604 --> 00:21.904
Right now.

- Hello? Dad?
- Hey, kid.

a little reunion.

- Fine.

00:50.868 --> 00:52.334
I'll figure out another way
to get across.

00:52.336 --> 00:54.169
- Oh, hey, hey.
Hey!

00:54.171 --> 00:55.838
I'm on the hook
for the cost of the passports,

00:55.840 --> 00:57.673
so you guys still owe me money.

00:57.675 --> 00:59.675
- I need to sneak
across the border.

00:59.677 --> 01:01.610
- I'll help you.
- Really?

01:01.612 --> 01:03.445
- But I have two things to say.

01:03.447 --> 01:06.115
One, my name is not Rosa.

01:06.117 --> 01:07.382
It's Sofia.

01:07.384 --> 01:10.119
And two, I get 10% of the ring.

01:10.121 --> 01:11.854
- Okay.
We get ourselves to the border.

01:11.856 --> 01:13.288
The Coyote smuggles us across.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.324
- $10,000 to be wired here
tomorrow.

01:15.326 --> 01:17.025
- You sure it'll come through?

01:17.027 --> 01:18.393
- Let's just say
my family takes

01:18.395 --> 01:20.028
a certain delight
in rescuing me.

01:20.030 --> 01:22.865
- I think I have a way
to find Maddie Jonson.

01:22.867 --> 01:23.866
Come with me.

01:23.868 --> 01:25.000
- I have one condition.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.502
After we find Maddie Jonson,

01:26.504 --> 01:28.704
we take down the doctor too.

01:28.706 --> 01:30.739
- Deal.
- Deal.

01:30.741 --> 01:32.207
- Not to press,
but the place where I work

01:32.209 --> 01:34.576
made such a difference
in my life.

01:34.578 --> 01:37.546
- Why come to a place like this
and make things up?

01:37.548 --> 01:39.882
Why sit here with me and lie?

01:39.884 --> 01:42.351
- You can't leave.
You're just getting started.

01:42.353 --> 01:43.886
- Linda,
what's right in front of me

01:43.888 --> 01:46.188
is a bill I can't afford, okay?

01:46.190 --> 01:48.524
- What if you had a friend that
could help you with that bill?

01:48.526 --> 01:50.459

what I had to do.

04:32.990 --> 04:35.724
- How did you know?

04:35.726 --> 04:40.862
- I... studied each person,

04:40.864 --> 04:42.998
figured out what it was
they needed from me,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.235
and then it was just a matter
of becoming that person.

04:47.237 --> 04:49.371
- So they would fall in love
with you.

04:49.373 --> 04:52.040
- Mm-hmm.
- But you're pretending...

04:52.042 --> 04:54.242
to be in love
with them too, right?

04:54.244 --> 04:56.878
- Yeah, and that's
the whole ball game, really.

04:58.983 --> 05:01.783
I would have to let myself
fall in love with them

05:01.785 --> 05:05.087

05:05.089 --> 05:07.389
That's why it's a con.

By loving them, they feel
safe enough to love me,

05:09.994 --> 05:15.797
and then they're hooked,
and then I leave.

if life was different,

05:37.454 --> 05:39.087

"If life was different?"

05:39.089 --> 05:40.956
- It doesn't matter,
that's not how the job works,

05:40.958 --> 05:44.960
and the man I worked for...

05:48.932 --> 05:50.565
- What would happen
if you went to the police

05:50.567 --> 05:52.334
and told them what you told me?

05:52.336 --> 05:53.668
Could you--

05:53.670 --> 05:56.238
- He is smarter
than the police.

05:58.575 --> 06:00.275
And he'd kill me.

06:00.277 --> 06:04.346
- Oh, okay.
That's frightening.

do this anymore,

06:06.417 --> 06:11.520

what the next step is.

06:11.522 --> 06:14.289
- You've spent a long time
training yourself

06:14.291 --> 06:17.092
to figure out what everyone
around you needs.

06:17.094 --> 06:21.163
It's now time to figure out
what you need, what you want.

06:21.165 --> 06:23.465

06:28.338 --> 06:29.671

06:29.673 --> 06:31.673
- I'm not lying.
- Well, no, not now.

06:31.675 --> 06:33.875
But it's your first instinct
to analyze

06:33.877 --> 06:35.844
what's in front of you
and then manipulate it,

06:35.846 --> 06:40.282
so, not to be flip,
just cut it out.

06:40.284 --> 06:42.684

06:46.323 --> 06:47.756
- Here.

06:47.758 --> 06:49.291
Put this on your wrist,

06:49.293 --> 06:52.060

snap it.

Big lie, little lie,

06:55.399 --> 06:56.998
- Well, it may seem silly,

the FBI maybe,

That's the truth.

but if I order them on rush,
they'll be here in 48 hours.

22:03.141 --> 22:06.943
- Forty-eight... what?

22:06.945 --> 22:08.912
Forty-eight hours?
No. No, no, no.

22:08.914 --> 22:11.081
I have to be there for my dad's
surgery by tomorrow morning.

22:11.083 --> 22:12.616
- I know.

22:12.618 --> 22:15.585
- How am I gonna
get to Chicago?

22:15.587 --> 22:19.255
Do you have, like, a rental car
or, like, an Uber?

22:19.257 --> 22:22.626
- Who?
- God.

22:22.628 --> 22:24.894
Fine, I'll-I'll figure
something out.

22:24.896 --> 22:26.830
- I wish there was something...
- I just--

22:26.832 --> 22:30.767
I just really
need to get there.

22:30.769 --> 22:33.136
- You know, I love this truck.
- Yeah, and I love my car.

22:33.138 --> 22:34.771
And I love my money.

22:34.773 --> 22:37.273
You think I would give you
my money and my car

22:37.275 --> 22:39.309
for this piece of junk?

22:39.311 --> 22:42.445
I'm sorry, I--
no offense.

I'm sorry.

23:06.938 --> 23:09.105
- When did you turn
into a prude?

23:09.107 --> 23:11.541
- A prude?
Maybe I'm just not comfortable

23:11.543 --> 23:12.709
listening to porn with--

23:12.711 --> 23:14.511
- It is not porn.
It's romance.

23:14.513 --> 23:17.480
- With my grandmother.
- Grandmother?

23:17.482 --> 23:19.115
- Yeah, you know,

23:19.117 --> 23:21.351
I can probably get you back

- Whatever, Patrick.

23:34.433 --> 23:36.833
Mm? 12 years.

23:36.835 --> 23:40.236
I like Erica, and I like
the two of you together.

23:40.238 --> 23:43.473
- Just stopped working.

23:43.475 --> 23:44.841
Her career took off,

23:44.843 --> 23:47.010
and she's an impressive woman,

23:47.012 --> 23:49.245
incredible mother.

23:49.247 --> 23:51.715
She does it all.

23:51.717 --> 23:54.718
But we... I don't know.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.186
- I do.

23:56.188 --> 23:57.854
She's a hot shot,
but you wanted to be

23:57.856 --> 23:59.689

24:04.262 --> 24:07.831

Maddie Jonson's con, right?

24:07.833 --> 24:09.933
- My relationship with Maddie
didn't have anything to do

24:09.935 --> 24:11.067
with me and Erika.

24:11.069 --> 24:12.402
That happened way before--

24:12.404 --> 24:14.537
- Your relationship
with Maddie,

24:14.539 --> 24:16.272
you actually thought
it was real.

24:16.274 --> 24:18.174
Let me ask you something.

24:18.176 --> 24:19.809
If you were stupid enough
to think that then,

24:19.811 --> 24:23.980
please tell me you're not
stupid enough to think it now.

24:23.982 --> 24:26.950

24:31.289 --> 24:33.289

- Uh-huh.

24:33.291 --> 24:36.693
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

24:40.866 --> 24:44.234
- So, what can you tell me
about me,

24:44.236 --> 24:46.536
since we were married and all?

24:47.706 --> 24:49.405
- You smile at someone,

24:49.407 --> 24:52.575
they feel like
they can do anything.

24:52.577 --> 24:55.578
At least that's how it was
with me.

24:55.580 --> 24:59.048
- That's nice.

24:59.050 --> 25:01.050
I hope you don't think
I'm being too forward,

25:01.052 --> 25:04.621
but, um, how were we in bed?

25:15.634 --> 25:16.800
Lovely.

25:18.837 --> 25:21.304
Gracias.

25:21.306 --> 25:23.640
- Gracias.

25:23.642 --> 25:24.974
Do you want to hear
about your plans

25:24.976 --> 25:26.910
to make me a senator?

25:26.912 --> 25:30.780
- Why, yes, I do.

25:30.782 --> 25:33.683
- Everything's gonna be okay.

25:33.685 --> 25:38.254
Your family's gonna be okay.
Max would never...

25:38.256 --> 25:43.293
- I'm sorry I was, uh,
secretive about Sofia.

25:43.295 --> 25:44.527
I think it felt good
to have something

25:44.529 --> 25:49.766
that was, uh, just mine,
you know?

25:49.768 --> 25:51.367
- I get it.

25:51.369 --> 25:55.038
I found something that feels
like it's just mine too.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.841
Mexico. All of it.
It's odd, you know?

25:57.843 --> 26:01.711
I feel like I'm myself here,
like I've come home to a place

26:01.713 --> 26:03.479
I've always known.

26:06.818 --> 26:08.585
- I think you should stay.

26:11.890 --> 26:13.890
- After your family's safe,
I can come back.

26:13.892 --> 26:16.359
- Except it never works
that way, does it?

26:16.361 --> 26:20.063
I mean, life,
it keeps taking you forward.

26:20.065 --> 26:22.866
You should stay.

26:22.868 --> 26:24.300
- I want to help you.

26:24.302 --> 26:25.802
- It helps me to know
that at least some of

26:25.804 --> 26:27.837
the people I love are safe.

26:29.140 --> 26:30.807
And happy.

26:33.311 --> 26:34.744
Good. It's settled.

26:34.746 --> 26:38.314
- I guess we both fell in love.
- Mm-hmm.

26:40.685 --> 26:42.752
- Don't tell Poppy, though.
The plan is that she gives us

26:42.754 --> 26:45.555
the money and drags me back
to Greenwich, okay?

26:45.557 --> 26:49.692
- None of my business.
- I love you, man.

26:49.694 --> 26:52.595
- Yeah. Yeah, you too.

26:52.597 --> 26:55.531
- Maddie Jonson is not
who you think she is.

26:55.533 --> 26:58.101
Hasn't been
for quite some time.

26:58.103 --> 27:00.503
I know this is probably
difficult for you to hear.

27:00.505 --> 27:02.505
- She has not now or ever
worked for UNICEF

27:02.507 --> 27:04.941
or lived in the Houston area
as far as we know.

27:04.943 --> 27:06.609
I'm sorry to inform you,

27:06.611 --> 27:09.345
she is wanted currently
by the FBI for her role

27:09.347 --> 27:12.181
in a number of conspiracies
to commit fraud.

27:12.183 --> 27:15.118
- Mrs. Jonson, your daughter
is a professional con artist,

27:15.120 --> 27:17.053
and unless we find her,
her life is

27:17.055 --> 27:19.255
most definitely in danger.

27:23.877 --> 27:26.446
- There is no UNICEF office
in Barcelona.

27:26.448 --> 27:31.317
She sent me a postcard
from there about her job.

27:31.319 --> 27:32.652
I've always suspected

27:32.654 --> 27:34.654
that Maddie was lying
about her life.

27:34.656 --> 27:36.489
- And you never confronted her
about it?

27:36.491 --> 27:40.660
- If my daughter wanted
to talk to me honestly,

27:40.662 --> 27:42.161
I would be here to listen.

27:42.163 --> 27:44.197
- Well, maybe she needed
you to step--

27:44.199 --> 27:45.798
- Mrs. Jonson, please know

27:45.800 --> 27:47.133
that we all have the same goal:

27:47.135 --> 27:49.102
to keep your daughter safe.

27:49.104 --> 27:51.170
Can you think of any
of Maddie's friends

27:51.172 --> 27:52.772
we might talk to?

27:52.774 --> 27:54.173
- She never really
kept in touch

27:54.175 --> 27:57.610
with anyone from here
that I know of.

27:57.612 --> 28:01.180
She's been gone a long time.

28:01.182 --> 28:03.650
- She ever mention
any marriages?

28:03.652 --> 28:05.985
- No, of course not.
She's never been married.

28:05.987 --> 28:08.021
- Wouldn't be so sure
about that.

28:08.023 --> 28:10.156
What about boyfriends?

28:10.158 --> 28:11.791
Girlfriends?

28:11.793 --> 28:16.162
Any intimate relationships
from here or anywhere else?

28:16.164 --> 28:19.732
- I really couldn't say.
- You couldn't, or you won't?

28:19.734 --> 28:22.568
- I couldn't
because she didn't mention it,

28:22.570 --> 28:24.904
and if she had, I'm not sure
that I would tell you.

28:24.906 --> 28:26.406
- Why is that?
- You're rude.

28:26.408 --> 28:27.740
- All right.

28:27.742 --> 28:29.008
I'm just simply trying
to find--

28:29.010 --> 28:30.576
- Do you have children?

28:30.578 --> 28:33.179
- Yes, I do, two little ones.
Thank you.

28:33.181 --> 28:37.450
- And do you know their
every thought and feeling?

28:37.452 --> 28:39.419
- No, ma'am, I don't.
- Mm-hmm.

28:39.421 --> 28:41.654
- However, I'd like to think

28:41.656 --> 28:43.256
that I'd have
some sort of inkling

28:43.258 --> 28:45.425
if they turned into
professional criminals--

28:45.427 --> 28:47.660
- Agent,
would you give us a few moments

28:47.662 --> 28:50.730
to talk, please,
mother to mother?

28:52.400 --> 28:56.135
- Sure.
Knock yourselves out.

28:59.374 --> 29:03.009
- Sorry about that.
We've had a long drive.

29:03.011 --> 29:05.411
- And he's arrogant.

29:05.413 --> 29:08.047
- And he's arrogant.

from Mr. Shelly Cohen.

30:18.586 --> 30:20.853
Was he really married to Lenny?

30:20.855 --> 30:22.255

30:22.257 --> 30:24.524
that there's someone

30:24.526 --> 30:26.859
- What does the doctor want?

30:26.861 --> 30:28.194
How angry is he?

30:28.196 --> 30:30.196
- How about how angry am I?

30:30.198 --> 30:34.000
You hung me out to dry with
a bag of pricks, you ingrate,

30:34.002 --> 30:36.702
and after all I taught you,
you had the balls--

30:36.704 --> 30:38.638

30:38.640 --> 30:41.641
How about you don't
lecture me about loyalty?

30:43.845 --> 30:46.779

was right,

30:46.781 --> 30:50.283
but I regret it... every day.

31:00.962 --> 31:02.962
<i> - Yeah, I talked to him.</i>

31:02.964 --> 31:05.364
He's just looking
for some information.

31:05.366 --> 31:08.401
And also, he's decided
to broaden the places

31:08.403 --> 31:10.269
where he's putting pressure.

31:10.271 --> 31:11.838
- What does that mean?

31:11.840 --> 31:14.974
- That means I'm sitting
next to Arthur Bloom.

31:14.976 --> 31:16.909
- You're doing what?
- Oh, no, no.

31:16.911 --> 31:19.846
Look, he's safe.
Your family is safe,

31:19.848 --> 31:21.714

to come in and see the doctor.

31:21.716 --> 31:25.318
Look, I did it,
and I'm still breathing.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.552
We can reach out to him
together

31:26.554 --> 31:27.920

31:52.580 --> 31:54.680
- You ever done this before?

31:54.682 --> 31:59.018
- Let's just say
I don't have much practice.

31:59.020 --> 32:00.887
- So go ahead.
You don't want to jerk.

32:00.889 --> 32:03.122
You want to squeeze
nice and easy,

32:03.124 --> 32:04.757
and as you line up--

32:10.365 --> 32:11.697
That wasn't terrible.

32:11.699 --> 32:14.734

- There are some very bad
people after your daughter.

32:17.972 --> 32:20.106
Now, I can protect her.

32:20.108 --> 32:22.575
First, I gotta find her.

- I wish I had more to tell.
I don't.

32:25.647 --> 32:27.713
- We appreciate your time.

32:27.715 --> 32:29.582
I'm sure this couldn't
have been easy.

32:29.584 --> 32:31.984
- It's not.

32:31.986 --> 32:33.119
- Anything you can think of,

32:33.121 --> 32:36.088
anything at all, please call.

32:36.090 --> 32:38.858
I want to find her before
she gets hurt, Margaret.

32:45.266 --> 32:48.768
- So let me get this straight.
You didn't press her at all?

32:48.770 --> 32:50.703
- I didn't bully her
if that's what you mean.

32:50.705 --> 32:53.005
- Agent Cook, she was
clearly holding out on us.

32:53.007 --> 32:56.142
I mean--
you know, it doesn't matter.

32:56.144 --> 32:57.777
I'm just gonna get creative.

32:57.779 --> 32:59.412
