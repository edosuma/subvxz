01:14.160 --> 01:16.515
<i>- Americano.</i>
<i>- Sì, americano.</i>

01:57.720 --> 02:00.075
<i>Ah! Pilota!</i>

04:11.000 --> 04:12.991
Party, inward... turn!

04:14.640 --> 04:16.630
Party... flag!

04:21.680 --> 04:25.150
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God to take unto himself...

04:25.240 --> 04:28.312
...the soul of our dear brother here departed...

04:28.400 --> 04:31.233
...we therefore commit his body to the ground.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.315
<i>Uno, due, tre!</i>

05:01.720 --> 05:04.712
Detail, outward... turn!

05:06.560 --> 05:08.869
Detail... quick march!

05:25.960 --> 05:29.316
Major Fincham, will you now
please dismiss your men? Please.

05:29.400 --> 05:33.951
- Where is your commandant?
- As I told you, Major Battaglia is indisposed.

05:34.040 --> 05:37.828
His orders are to disperse
immediately after the funeral.

05:41.280 --> 05:45.796
- Major Fincham, please.
- Get that Fascist bastard out here!

05:51.400 --> 05:53.391
<i>Grazie.</i>

05:55.080 --> 05:59.471
- You'd better follow me, please, Colonel.
- Thanks, pal.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.269
What are they celebrating out there?

06:17.360 --> 06:19.351
<i>Signor maggiore.</i>

06:29.960 --> 06:34.750
Ryan, Joseph L.
United States Army Air Corps. 0718359.

06:36.880 --> 06:40.031
Don't you salute senior officers
in your army, Major?

06:43.640 --> 06:46.108
- Are you the official interpreter?
- Yes, sir.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.237
- Then interpret exactly. Clear?
- Yes, sir.

06:55.160 --> 06:59.950
And add this: No wonder Italy's
losing the war, with officers like him.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.111
Well?

07:13.720 --> 07:16.712
Battaglia! Battaglia!

07:16.800 --> 07:19.234
Battaglia! Battaglia!

07:19.320 --> 07:22.915
Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!

07:23.000 --> 07:25.673
Battaglia! Battaglia!

07:26.800 --> 07:31.351
We have today buried
our commanding officer...

07:31.440 --> 07:33.829
...Colonel Brian David Lockart!

07:34.920 --> 07:39.436
The purpose of this parade
is to bear witness to his death...

07:39.520 --> 07:42.557
...and charge the man responsible for it!

07:43.160 --> 07:45.151
Major Battaglia!

07:46.160 --> 07:51.996
The Ninth Fusiliers now formally charge you
with the murder of Colonel Lockart!

07:52.080 --> 07:55.152
Come forward and meet your accusers!

08:05.400 --> 08:07.391
<i>Sì, signor maggiore.</i>

08:07.480 --> 08:10.233
Battaglia! Battaglia!

08:10.320 --> 08:11.309
Follow me, please.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.632
Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!

08:27.600 --> 08:31.912
Major Fincham, unless you dismiss
your men now, it will be out of my hands.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.595
- That swine hasn't the guts.
- You have left him no choice.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.791
You've shot one of my men!

08:40.360 --> 08:44.068
He's fainted, sir. It's Ransom.
One of those from hospital.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.431
Dismiss.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.878
Parade... dismiss!

08:57.640 --> 09:00.029
Captain Stein! One moment.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.237
This is Colonel Ryan.
He needs your attention too.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.508
- American.
- Army Air Corps.

09:21.080 --> 09:24.755
Begging your pardon, sir.
Are we still beating them in Sicily?

09:24.840 --> 09:27.832
We took Messina three days ago.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.356
- Are you reporting for sick parade, Sergeant?
- No, sir.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.512
I'm still trying to get
what my boys have needed all along.

09:54.600 --> 09:58.559
I'm afraid I still have the same answer
for you: There isn't any.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.991
Easy, fellas. Easy.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.431
Over here, Colonel.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.074
The stool will do.

10:24.160 --> 10:28.517
- Looks like you got a full house.
- And getting fuller, I'm afraid.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.672
- What's the matter with these men?
- Malaria, scurvy.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.035
Made worse by malnutrition.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.908
- I've only alcohol for a disinfectant.
- Go right ahead, Doc.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.552
How come you can't control
the malaria with drugs?

10:41.640 --> 10:43.995
The Eyeties make no mepacrine.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.152
The Eyeties grow food.
Get extra rations for your sick.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.276
And clean up some of this filth.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.999
And perhaps get 'em some clean uniforms.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.709
Our diet and filth are Battaglia's
punishment for escape attempts.

10:55.800 --> 10:59.429
He's taken our soap and razors,
turned off our shower baths...

10:59.520 --> 11:04.116
...issued us with no uniforms or Red Cross
parcels, and kept us on half rations.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.988
But he can't break us,
and he can't stop us trying to escape.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.514
Even with the way
the war is going for us now?

11:10.600 --> 11:12.989
Are you suggesting
we should knuckle under?

11:13.080 --> 11:16.709
If that's what it takes, yes.
Liberation can only be a few weeks away.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.832
Did you hear the colonel's suggestion, fellas?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.511
What do <i>you</i> think?

11:24.640 --> 11:28.155
Well... meanin' no disrespect to him, sir...

11:28.240 --> 11:32.631
...I'd say the colonel ought to muck off, sir.

11:33.920 --> 11:38.471
I can't expect you to understand this,
but these men belong to the Ninth Fusiliers.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.836
This regiment fought
with Mariborough in 1704...

11:41.920 --> 11:44.957
...with Wellington against Napoleon,
and in the Crimea.

11:45.040 --> 11:49.875
These men are all volunteers, professionals,
and they've come to fight a war.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.196
It may come as news to you, Major,
but that's why we're all here.

11:54.280 --> 11:58.432
Yes, but each in his different way. You
ought to know that. You're a professional.

11:58.520 --> 12:02.399
Negative. I'm what they call at home
a 90-day wonder.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.473
- I'm an airplane driver. My business is flying.
- Ours is soldiering.

12:07.040 --> 12:11.636
OK, clue me. Suppose you do rig an escape.
How many men do you figure to get clear?

12:11.720 --> 12:15.713
- Colonel Ryan, if one gets out, it's a victory.
- Sure it is.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.870
Can somebody show me where I bunk?

12:18.960 --> 12:20.757
- Sergeant Major.
- Sir?

12:20.840 --> 12:23.400
- Escort Colonel Ryan to his quarters.
- Yes, sir.

12:23.480 --> 12:25.471
We dine at six, sir.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.471
- Major.
- This way, Colonel.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.553
Sergeant Bostick, sir. 113th Tank Division.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.753
This is Corporal Giannini, and Private Ames.

12:50.440 --> 12:54.433
The reason we didn't say anything to you
in the sickbay, we wanted to get you alone.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.511
They've all gone to mess.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.075
- Are you cold, son?
- It's that damn malaria.

13:00.160 --> 13:04.312
Don't knock it, Bostick. You ever have it,
Colonel? The fever makes you dream.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.517
And, man, what dreams!
You know what I mean, sir?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.909
- No. What?
- Well, they...

13:11.160 --> 13:13.594
Hey. He's pretty sharp, huh?

13:14.000 --> 13:18.118
You're a welcome sight, sir.
We need an American officer real bad.

13:20.080 --> 13:23.470
- How many of us are there?
- Eight. We've lost two.

13:23.560 --> 13:27.792
And if we don't get some decent grub and
medicine, that's gonna double and triple.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.156
That's tough. From what I've seen,
everybody's in the same boat.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.073
Sure, because the guys running it
are section eight.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.914
Those stir-crazy limey officers
are trying to fight the war from in here.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.231
They got so many tunnels dug,
you could fall into one.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.835
- You expect me to keep them from digging?
- You got the rank for it, sir.

13:44.920 --> 13:50.074
Don't get us wrong, sir. Nobody's here to
defend Battaglia. He's a two-bit Mussolini.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.957
But if they'd let up, he would too.

13:52.040 --> 13:56.989
With Sicily gone, our guys will come through
Italy like shoe polish through a tin horn.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.197
All we gotta do is get healthy,
sit tight and wait.

14:00.280 --> 14:04.796
These people have been here for two years.
I just got here. I need time to check this out.

14:04.880 --> 14:09.271
Not too long. Please, sir.
Three of my boys are just about gone now.

14:36.080 --> 14:39.914
Colonel Ryan, this is Captain Costanzo,
our regimental chaplain.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.956
- Lieutenant Orde.
- Lieutenant.

14:42.040 --> 14:45.828
- Delighted, Colonel Ryan.
- Please sit down. Sorry I kept you waiting.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.275
Colonel Lockart always sat here.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.956
I'll be fine right here. Thank you.

15:03.960 --> 15:09.273
Major, if you don't mind talking about it,
how did your colonel buy it?

15:09.360 --> 15:11.749
He struck Battaglia with his stick.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.715
Do you see that sweatbox there?

15:15.480 --> 15:17.675
Colonel Lockart died in there last night.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.752
Which makes you
the senior officer of this camp.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.678
My regiment will await your orders.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.274
It's still your regiment, Major.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.351
Thank you, sir.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.793
It's made from pumpkins, you know.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.474
Just a little different, don't you think?

15:59.560 --> 16:02.677
We couldn't help noticing
where you sat, Colonel.

16:02.760 --> 16:06.070
It took 200 years to make officers
like those. It took me 90 days.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.594
- They're nuts, sir.
- It's their ball game.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.274
- We're still shut out.
- We did as good with a sergeant.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.749
Now we got us a bird colonel.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.916
A bird colonel outranks a birdbrain. Clear?

16:18.400 --> 16:20.709
- Anything else, Sergeant?
- No, sir.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.750
Bird is right. Chicken.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.354
OK, OK. Now we know we're on our own.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.478
- Do you feel up to a bit of running, sir?
- Running?

17:00.560 --> 17:03.757
Dodging the lights, I mean.
It's pretty important.

18:16.520 --> 18:20.433
- What the hell is this?
- Earth, sir, from the tunnel.

18:20.520 --> 18:25.514
We reckon the barracks ceiling can hold
two tons of it if we spread it around right.

18:54.200 --> 18:58.432
Sorry to ask you to make this trip,
but I thought you ought to be here.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.956
Your countrymen were caught
trying to steal supplies.

19:04.800 --> 19:09.271
- What supplies, Major?
- Escape rations. See for yourself.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.192
These men are thieves.

19:50.280 --> 19:54.239
But since they're Americans,
I wanted your approval to punish them.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.676
- What's your side?
- My boys need things from those parcels, sir.

19:57.760 --> 20:01.639
- Food. And more important, mepacrine.
- That true, Major?

20:01.720 --> 20:04.837
Perfectly. But these men are thieves
and should be punished.

20:04.920 --> 20:09.391
Negative. These men are sick. You've also got
50 men in sickbay with the same disease.

20:09.480 --> 20:13.314
- What the hell are you doing about that?
- War produces casualties, Colonel.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.834
Everyone in camp's been exposed to malaria.

20:15.920 --> 20:20.471
The only way a man has a chance of escape is
for him to have mepacrine to keep him going.

20:20.560 --> 20:24.439
Forget the punishment, Major. Bostick,
get these men outta here. See me later.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.511
- My boys are sick, sir.
- Out.

20:31.840 --> 20:36.197
- Major, move those parcels to the sickbay.
- What did you say?

20:36.920 --> 20:39.480
- That's a direct order.
- Damn your direct order!

20:39.560 --> 20:45.317
I'm the ranking officer here. You'll deliver
those parcels tonight. Is that clear, mister?

20:48.520 --> 20:53.230
You'd better know what you're doing,
unless you want a mutiny on your hands.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.470
Mutiny in the Ninth Fusiliers?

20:55.560 --> 20:59.712
Wellington and Mariborough would
spin in their graves, Major, what?

21:09.080 --> 21:14.757
321 present, 83 in hospital,
404 men present or accounted for.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.434
- You may dismiss.
- If you don't mind, Captain...

21:17.520 --> 21:21.229
...l'm assuming command
as senior officer of the camp.

21:21.640 --> 21:25.428
That is, of course, between you.
I will inform Major Battaglia.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.910
I'd rather do that personally.
Will you take me to him?

21:29.480 --> 21:31.755
Rest the men, Major, but keep them here.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.031
Stand at... ease!

21:39.120 --> 21:41.111
Stand easy.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.789
<i>Avanti!</i>

22:32.000 --> 22:35.913
My major warns you that he has
no patience left with the prisoners.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.993
By taking command, you have become
personally responsible for their actions.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.832
Good.

22:41.920 --> 22:47.153
And tell him that, from now on, things will be
much more different than they've been.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.914
You have made a good impression
on the major.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.596
- But he warns you against trying to trick him.
- Never. Of course not.

23:06.920 --> 23:12.278
Ask the major to come with me now. I'll prove
how different things'll be around this camp.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.310
What in heaven's name is he doing?

23:49.400 --> 23:51.436
What does it look like?

23:52.600 --> 23:54.556
Ryan!

23:54.640 --> 23:56.232
Ryan!

23:56.320 --> 24:00.438
Ryan, you can't do this.
You can't do this to anyone.

24:00.520 --> 24:04.957
- I'm glad you could join us, Major.
- If you betray us, you'll pay for it.

24:05.040 --> 24:10.353
You're just in time to watch. Have the men
turn about face so they can watch too. Major?

24:11.480 --> 24:14.870
Sergeant Bostick, rip up that shower floor.

24:16.720 --> 24:21.555
Parade... about... turn!

24:37.480 --> 24:40.916
All right. Now hear this.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.632
While I'm in command, anyone attempting
to escape will be held for court martial.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.598
Clear?

24:49.680 --> 24:52.399
Stand steady on parade!

24:52.600 --> 24:55.194
You'll get the Nazi Iron Cross
for this, Von Ryan!

24:56.200 --> 25:01.593
By order of the commandant, the showers
will be turned on at 1200 hours.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.188
Razors will be provided
and delousing powder issued.

25:06.680 --> 25:11.071
Beginning tonight, Red Cross parcels
will be distributed once a week.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.878
- You may dismiss the parade.
- Not so fast, Captain.

25:14.960 --> 25:18.714
What about the clothing in the Red Cross
parcels in that storage house?

25:18.800 --> 25:21.234
I advise you to forget this matter.

25:21.320 --> 25:25.950
Sure, because Battaglia's got a black market
going in Red Cross clothes. Right?

25:26.040 --> 25:29.669
You tell this man I trusted him
as a gentleman. I want those clothes.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.312
I'm sorry. The major says
he cannot issue... wine.

25:41.400 --> 25:45.951
Wine? Who the hell said anything
about wine? I'm talking about clothes.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.951
It's for your own good, Colonel.

25:50.520 --> 25:53.671
You let yourself be bought
pretty cheaply, didn't you?

25:53.760 --> 25:56.149
Louse powder and hot water? Hah!

25:56.920 --> 26:00.310
- Orde, dismiss the men.
- I'll tell you when to dismiss, Lieutenant.

26:00.400 --> 26:04.518
Bostick, tear the door off that bathhouse,
and use anything else you might need.

26:04.600 --> 26:05.999
Right, sir.

26:06.880 --> 26:10.350
Major Fincham, you will give
an order for the men to strip.

26:10.440 --> 26:13.159
Strip. Understand? Naked.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.871
Parade... strip.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.875
Now take off all of those rags. All of them!

26:34.520 --> 26:37.512
And, Major, that goes for the officers as well.

26:39.760 --> 26:44.390
Pass thatjunk from the rear to the front
of the line and throw it in the fire!

27:38.240 --> 27:40.708
Captain Costanzo, I said strip.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.632
Sir, I take being
a member of the cloth literally.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.871
I bow to your convictions, Captain.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.673
- Here comes II Duce!
- Attention!

28:07.480 --> 28:11.632
The major feels the fire
should be put out at once.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.837
Tell him we have no firefighting equipment.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.834
- He says you are no gentleman, Colonel.
- Only by an act of Congress.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.911
Now what about the clothing?

29:23.400 --> 29:26.392
The prisoners will be issued clothing,
Colonel Ryan.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.199
But you, sir, I'm afraid, must follow me.

29:39.120 --> 29:41.111
Good show, Colonel!

29:53.440 --> 29:57.115
Major Fincham!
You may dismiss when ready.

30:30.960 --> 30:36.034
We made it, Colonel. Our guys
landed at Salerno. Italy's surrendered.

30:37.960 --> 30:42.033
That's great. Just great.

30:42.120 --> 30:47.069
Yeah. Our guys are ready to shove off, but
these limeys back here are giving us trouble.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.151
Hello, sir. Are you all right?

30:49.240 --> 30:52.152
Could you come right away? There's trouble.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.394
- There are no guards.
- They bolted during the night.

31:16.480 --> 31:20.029
Major Fincham took Battaglia prisoner.
He's court-martialling him.

31:20.120 --> 31:26.070
Let the regimental records show Captain
Stein appearing as defending officer...

31:26.160 --> 31:31.075
...Lieutenant Orde as prosecuting officer.
Major Fincham presiding.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.030
If the court pleases.

31:34.120 --> 31:38.671
- Colonel Ryan, this is no affair of yours.
- I'm still the senior officer in this camp.

31:38.760 --> 31:42.639
We're holding a summary court martial
exactly according to regulations.

31:42.720 --> 31:46.349
What happens when you find him guilty,
according to regulations?

31:46.440 --> 31:49.989
- He will be hanged.
- That'll be murder. He's now a civilian.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.789
No, sir. We're still at war,
and the enemy is still the enemy.

31:53.880 --> 31:56.713
I say hang him!

31:59.920 --> 32:03.356
Major, release this man.
Oriani, get him outta here.

32:03.440 --> 32:06.193
The parade will stand at ease!

32:28.760 --> 32:32.389
The major begs me to say that...

32:32.480 --> 32:34.471
...he never meant you harm.

32:34.560 --> 32:38.269
It was Mussolini and his Fascists
who forced him to be harsh.

32:40.440 --> 32:43.034
Now it's all finished for Italy.

32:43.680 --> 32:48.356
Let the killing be finished too.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.430
You want your revenge with this?

32:53.520 --> 32:55.636
I wantjustice.

32:55.720 --> 33:00.555
Not only for Colonel Lockart and the other
dead, but for those of us who are still alive.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.437
We're 200 miles behind the lines.

33:02.520 --> 33:08.038
I say not only military justice but military
sense dictates we cannot turn this man loose.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.509
- Aye!
- There's a better way, Major.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.830
- You all wantjustice?
-  Yes!

33:12.920 --> 33:16.310
Then do to him what he did to your colonel.
Put him in a sweatbox to rot.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.391
- No!
- Yes!

33:45.640 --> 33:47.358
You fool.

33:47.440 --> 33:51.228
- You soft-headed, sentimental fool.
- That's privilege of rank, Major.

33:51.320 --> 33:56.474
Damn your rank. If letting that scum live
costs the life of one of my men, I promise...

34:01.040 --> 34:03.395
Scatter! Hit the deck! Hit the deck!

34:19.080 --> 34:21.435
He pinpointed us. We'd better move quick.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.830
- Brilliant, Colonel. Where?
- We're a day's march from the coast.

34:24.920 --> 34:28.150
- I could contact your navy.
- Move 400 men in daylight? You're mad.

34:28.239 --> 34:30.036
- I'll lead you.
- Why should you?

34:30.120 --> 34:32.350
You think you hate the Germans
more than I do?

34:32.440 --> 34:34.873
- It's worth a chance.
- I don't trust the Eyeties.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.952
But I'm in command here
and I say we move - now.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.312
Halt!

35:19.120 --> 35:21.190
German convoy! Everybody down!

35:49.440 --> 35:51.556
Those ruins could hide a thousand men.

35:51.640 --> 35:56.031
Let them rest there for the night
while I go ahead and contact the ships.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.755
How much farther to the coast?

35:58.840 --> 36:02.549
Five... perhaps six miles.
I should be back well before dawn.

36:02.640 --> 36:06.474
That's as pretty a place for a trap
as I've ever seen.

36:06.560 --> 36:10.155
Good luck, Oriani. We'll be
waiting for you. Now let's go.

37:25.400 --> 37:26.389
<i>Kamerad.</i>

38:44.280 --> 38:46.271
Face it, Yank.

38:46.360 --> 38:49.591
Your little Eyetie chum has deserted us.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.875
We're left in a box.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.951
Colonel!

38:55.440 --> 38:57.431
Something's moving!

38:57.520 --> 38:58.999
Out! Out!

38:59.080 --> 39:01.435
Germans! Scatter!

39:01.520 --> 39:04.398
Scatter! Scatter! Come on!

40:23.040 --> 40:25.031
OK. Now.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.911
Hold it. Hold it!

40:42.960 --> 40:47.715
Colonel Ryan, Major Fincham, Captain Stein
and Costanzo, Lieutenant Orde - the front car.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.836
I'm a doctor. I stay with the wounded.

40:49.920 --> 40:54.914
They will remain behind so we can care
for them properly. Get aboard, gentlemen.

40:59.280 --> 41:03.239
That little Eyetie bastard Oriani
led us to the railhead and turned us in.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.914
It was that pig who betrayed us!

41:21.280 --> 41:23.271
I'll kill you!

41:30.840 --> 41:35.118
They've cared for our wounded properly now.
The poor bastards.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.634
Just cos you let Battaglia live!

41:37.720 --> 41:41.076
You'll get your Iron Cross now, Von Ryan.

42:34.200 --> 42:38.751
Hey, the roads are full of Germans.
It means we must still be headed north.

42:48.400 --> 42:52.518
You can bet on it, Yank. Von Ryan's
got us all a one-way ticket to the Fatherland.

42:52.600 --> 42:55.751
- Yeah!
- Aw, blow it out your barracks bag, mate.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.434
Listen, I'll take you on any time you like!

44:13.240 --> 44:15.231
We are coming in to Rome.

45:34.360 --> 45:38.114
I am Major von Klement,
now in command of this prison train.

45:38.920 --> 45:42.435
You will be in my charge
until we reach the final destination.

45:42.520 --> 45:46.911
You have now 30 minutes for rest, relief,
and there is food and water for all.

45:47.720 --> 45:49.597
Major von Klement?

45:50.920 --> 45:56.438
Captain Oriani is an Italian officer. He's not
a prisoner of war. He doesn't belong with us.

45:56.520 --> 46:00.035
I have my orders.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.032
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

47:13.120 --> 47:15.509
The guards are on top again.

47:15.600 --> 47:18.637
They're not needed here
as far as we're concerned.

47:19.680 --> 47:23.309
No chance of our tunnelling
through <i>this</i> coop, Von Ryan.

48:02.280 --> 48:06.478
Say, Doc, you got a knife
in that manicuring kit of yours?

48:26.240 --> 48:28.879
Are you planning
to snip your way through it?

48:28.960 --> 48:30.712
No.

48:30.800 --> 48:33.314
I'm planning to <i>tunnel</i> my way through it.

48:47.320 --> 48:49.311
Do you mind, Major?

49:03.880 --> 49:08.476
No, no, Colonel, wait. Wait until...
until the wheels hit cross tracks.

49:08.560 --> 49:11.199
It will cover the sound of the wood breaking.

50:02.840 --> 50:05.559
It's impossible to get out
while we are moving.

50:05.640 --> 50:10.031
- And when we stop, the guards will patrol.
- If it's dark when we stop, I'll risk it.

50:10.120 --> 50:14.750
- What about the rest? If one goes, we all go.
- Do we, now? Mind telling me how?

50:14.840 --> 50:17.434
- We'll have to eliminate the guards.
- Brilliant!

50:17.520 --> 50:21.229
They have machine pistols
and we have bare hands.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.199
If we could take one gun from one guard...

51:00.560 --> 51:02.551
Oriani?

51:03.000 --> 51:04.877
Turn around.

51:04.960 --> 51:06.951
Go on. Just turn around.

51:13.520 --> 51:16.512
Learn that from the cowboy films, did you?

51:18.400 --> 51:20.072
You got a better idea?

51:20.160 --> 51:23.550
It would take you too long
to strangle a man, Colonel Ryan.

51:23.640 --> 51:27.428
The average Nazi would get impatient
while you were doing it.

51:27.520 --> 51:29.511
Orde.

51:36.360 --> 51:40.558
The knots smash his larynx, the knee
breaks his back. He's dead in 15 seconds.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.517
Thug garrotte - India.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.114
All right, then. Now what's your scheme?

53:42.440 --> 53:45.238
If you haven't the guts for it, I'll do it.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.871
We're stopping again.

54:45.880 --> 54:47.916
Something must have gone wrong.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.037
- Perhaps they've been caught.
- Take it easy, Padre.

55:44.960 --> 55:46.791
- There's a station up ahead.
- Wait.

55:46.880 --> 55:49.678
- Someone might be watching.
- It's a chance we'll take.

55:49.760 --> 55:52.558
The guards are on this side.
Open the door on that side.

55:52.640 --> 55:55.074
- What kind of insanity...
- Knock it off.

55:55.160 --> 55:57.754
- Get the men on the roof right away.
- Right, sir.

55:58.120 --> 56:00.873
If you fail, the Germans
won't have to kill you. I will.

56:00.960 --> 56:02.313
Shut up.

56:14.080 --> 56:16.071
Shh. Shh.

56:17.760 --> 56:23.198
Bostick, you follow me with half the men.
Dunbar, spread out with the rest. Move. Quiet.

57:35.840 --> 57:37.637
Let's turn 'em loose.

57:50.560 --> 57:53.757
- Can we get moving?
- The engineer's alive but not the fireman.

57:53.840 --> 57:57.230
- I can stoke the boiler, sir.
- Get Oriani up with the engineer.

57:57.320 --> 58:01.711
- Send the chaplain and the doctor here.
- Yes, sir. Get those bodies in the boxcar!

58:01.800 --> 58:03.791
Get this stiff in the boxcar.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.791
Get those bods in quick!

58:27.640 --> 58:29.631
Move, you people! Come on, move!

58:52.720 --> 58:55.109
Ten more minutes... Of all the luck!

58:56.080 --> 59:02.349
He'll have to stop for water, same as we did.
By the time he gets goin' we'll be miles away.

59:11.960 --> 59:14.474
Damn thing's right behind us.

59:16.760 --> 59:18.751
Can you bring him around? We'll need him.

59:38.560 --> 59:40.551
Come on. Come on!

59:46.800 --> 59:48.756
All the comforts of home.

59:48.840 --> 59:51.957
Please. I am Italian.
I have done nothing. Please.

59:53.280 --> 59:57.671
- What on earth are you doing here, my child?
- Padre, you're priceless.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.277
Don't you think she ought to
get dressed while we discuss it?

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.113
He's right. Go on, girl. No one will hurt you.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.357
Now, about some questions, Major.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.431
- May I rise?
- Of course.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.994
I will answer no questions, <i>Herr Oberst.</i>

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:20.910
Major... All your guards are dead.
We're running this train now.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.199
I want the schedule of when and where we're
gonna get that food you promised us. Clear?

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:35.996
- Florence at 0600 hours.
- And what happens in Florence?

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:39.789
The train will stop in the rail complex
and the prisoners can dismount.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.269
Colonel Ryan! Colonel, look!

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.630
Looks like we're headed for Innsbruck.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.790
What do these circles mean, Major?

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:56.477
I am to receive instructions in those cities
from the dispatchers. I, myself. No one else.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.791
Did you receive those instructions
through that radio there?

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.270
- No. It is a simple commercial radio.
- All right. Over there.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.113
Lieutenant, if he wiggles, put a hole in him.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.437
- They're keeping pace with us.
- A German troop train is on this schedule.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.399
Gentlemen, you have been very daring.
Yet what have you gained?

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.472
In Florence, other troops are waiting.
You have been brave.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.031
If you now wish to be sensible, I will see
that you are treated with respect in Florence.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.317
We had a sample of your Nazi respect
when we boarded this train.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.518
- Still, you have no choice.
- And nothing to lose by trying to make one.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:48.433
Von Klement's identification papers and
railroad priority, good as far as Florence.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.717
- You do very well with German, Padre.
- I studied in Germany.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.916
I went to Breslau after Oxford.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.390
Would the dispatcher in Florence
recognise the major by sight?

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:03.313
- He'd be an Italian, wouldn't he?
- Of course! Under German supervision.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.075
- And I think you're lying.
- I'd say, with the country in such a flap...

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.631
...the chances that the dispatcher
will ask for identification is pretty small.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.156
Will ask whom? I mean,
you just said just now...

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.032
- Yes. It'll just have to be the chance we take.
- You are extremely foolish!

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.112
- Quite right.
- Oh, no. But I...

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.476
But... look at this picture!
I don't look remotely like this chap.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.028
No, no. I won't do it.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.111
I won't do it. Absolutely not.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.912
- <i>Heil Hitler!</i>
- That's better. Now let's see you walk.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.037
- It won't work, you know.
- Yes, it will. Let's see you walk.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.396
Put some style into it. Hand on your hip.
The Boche have style.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.789
Slap your gloves against your leg.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.118
<i>- Heil Hitler!</i>
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.111
<i>Gut. Sehr gut.</i>

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.794
I think you had him goin' there, vicar.
You all set?

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:05.749
Yes, sir. I came over the tops of the cars to
check. 14 of our guys are stationed as guards.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.308
The rest of the uniforms were too bloody.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.598
- Did you get rid of the bodies?
- While we were passing over the last bridge.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.912
The lieutenant wants our men down
from the top of the train, to be fed first.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.878
If they get down, we're dead.
They can't speak German.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.951
We've had it.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.550
Crikey! Ain't that our vicar?

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.391
Better check our lovebirds.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.951
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.431
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.837
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:24.274
- Here they come!
- My God, they've done it!

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:28.395
Well done, Padre. You've done it.
My God, you've done it.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.513
Believe it or not, the poor devil's fainted.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.078
They must be moving
a couple of divisions south.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.879
From the map, we'll be away
from the main roads by dark.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.791
The men could be gone in ten minutes.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.270
How do we get ten minutes
with that troop train only five behind us?

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:22.069
- It could turn off at Bologna.
- Or follow us straight to Berlin.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.278
Escaped? We haven't escaped.
All we're doing is this bastard's job for him.

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:32.832
Exactly. And in Verona, which is marked by
an X on the map, I will be properly grateful.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.912
At Verona, both the train crew and
guard detail is scheduled to be changed.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.309
That's if we go to Verona.

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:41.152
Look here.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.629
Suppose, when we get to Bologna, we...

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.273
...we could pass it and go
to the left into Milano.

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:51.831
And you go, hm?
Perhaps on American railroads, yes?

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.118
But this train is under the orders
of the German high command.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.795
Such things are not possible.
To reroute a military train...

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:05.193
...requires a written order signed by
a member of the general staff, Colonel.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.319
Major, yours is not the only army
that works in triplicate forms.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.475
Obergruppenführer Wilhelm von Kleist.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.038
- Does that mean general staff?
- It does indeed.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.830
Well, now. We've got a pad full of blank forms
and we've got a typewriter.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:30.993
- I say! Wizard!
- We can't be any worse off than we are now.

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.911
Quite.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.470
Let's say we type an order to Klement here.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.432
Upon arriving in Bologna,
he's told to go to Milan...

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:45.594
...where he is given confidential
instructions from Gruppenführer...

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.470
- Give me a good Aryan name.
- Um... Ottfried. Johann Heinrich.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.758
Gruppenführer Heinrich, who is in charge
of a trainload of sealed boxcars...

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.833
...to be delivered to somebody...
big, important.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.673
- Fatso Goering.
- <i>Der dicke Hermann.</i> Brilliant!

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.149
- Loot for the <i>Reichsmarschall.</i>
- Major?

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.074
It might do. It's got enough nerve -
I'll give you that.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.438
And we have it signed by our good friend
from general staff, Wilhelm von Kleist.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.875
<i>- Amerikanisch, nicht?</i>
<i>- Ja.</i>

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.594
<i>Hauptmann Joseph Sonneberg, Herr Major.</i>

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.837
<i>Danke sehr.</i>

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.911
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.911
Give this to the engineer.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.351
Gestapo.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.837
- How long is it now?
- Ten minutes, and my pulse is up 12 points.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.911
- How'd it go?
- Piece of cake.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.991
Leave it. Everybody stay low.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.754
Gestapo. Get those blinds up.

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.031
<i>Gestapo.</i>

01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.594
<i>Nylon.</i>

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.751
<i>Amerikanische Zigaretten.</i>

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.751
<i>Ja.</i>

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:47.117
That chap ought to be
reported to his superiors.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.391
That's the end of ruddy that.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.791
<i>Colonnello.</i>

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.990
- We have found it.
- Found what?

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:21.870
We have found a place to leave the train.
An abandoned branch line halfway to Milano.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.076
Come on. Let's have a look.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.511
Looks to be about...

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.431
...90 miles.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.755
- We'll get there by 2100 hours.
- Add half an hour, to stop for water.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:45.358
- That's better still. It'll be good and dark.
- By morning, 90% of your men will be dead.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:49.558
We don't need him any more. Or her either.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.269
Don't flinch. If you haven't
the stomach for it, it'll be my pleasure.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.430
- I'll decide that.
- Like with Battaglia?

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.431
- That was different.
- I intend it to be.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.114
- You'll take your orders, Major!
- I'm afraid not.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.556
- For God's sake! These are people!
- People don't shoot wounded!

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:07.269
But they do commit murder in cold blood?
Are you that far gone?

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.635
May I go to my compartment now?

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.711
Yes, of course.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.798
You haven't had any food
since we took over the train.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:34.873
- I'm not hungry.
- Of course you are. Here, take it. Relax.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.835
You cannot hide it. I know you will do
what the British major wants.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.717
You mean to kill you both?

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:49.839
It is the right thing.
In your place, I would do it.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.119
No, you wouldn't. You're not that tough.

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:55.794
- Then what do you want?
- Nothing.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.391
Not to help me?

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.911
If I can, yes.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.631
That is what all men say.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.113
How old are you?

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.431
The first was the same man
who helped my mother.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.431
I was not yet confirmed then.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.312
Such things do not happen in America?

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.275
- Why are you with this German?
- For food, for clothing. To stay alive.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.989
- Is that all?
- There is a war, you know.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.118
Yeah.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.791
How did you say it?

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.631
Relax?

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.869
You think my legs are too thin?

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.108
Why don't you close the door?

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.390
I will.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.471
On the way out.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:24.468
-  We need water! We're hungry too!
- Knock it off in there!

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:28.678
- If they knew what was going on, they would.
- They'll just have to sweat it out.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.349
What the hell are we waiting for now?

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.435
Come on!

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.791
They're gone. They're not here.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.311
He's dead.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.634
Back! Back! Get up on top!

01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:00.714
- We can't leave them behind to talk.
- Cover that side. Work up toward the engine.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.591
Get back!

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.231
All right. Let's move.

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.711
Get this train moving now!

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.634
Don't run away!

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.672
Get your hands off me
or I'll blow your head off!

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:27.993
These tracks have quite a shine
for not having been used.

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.833
Something's been running on this spur.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:04.715
These tracks have been used recently.
But we don't know what's ahead.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.189
It's deserted here. Let's get cracking.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:10.909
- Last stop, Colonel?
- Last stop, soldier. Everybody out.

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:23.031
All cars unload!

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:32.434
- Those are not German planes.
- American?

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.592
No. British. Lancaster, I think.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.195
Sorry to turn you out in the middle
of nowhere, but it can't be helped.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.430
Now, head for the mountains or the sea.

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:45.832
We'll form up again and have another crack
at Jerry. Off you go, lads. Good luck.

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.593
Everybody back on the train!
Back on the train!

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.231
Get back! Get back on the train!

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.070
Come on, move! Back! Get in!

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.559
Come on, move! Back!

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.392
Oriani!

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:14.473
Take this train outta here! Go! Go! Come on!

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.592
Let the coward go!

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:26.270
Stop the train!

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.071
Bostick! Bostick!

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:03.472
- Injured to the lounge car!
- Tell Oriani to cut the burning cars loose!

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:20.790
- Where's Oriani? We're ready to roll.
- Roll? Roll where?

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:28.518
Three dead, and the rest need better help than
I can give 'em. Maybe it's the end of the line.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.955
<i>Colonnello.</i>

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.554
This man thinks he can get us through.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:37.269
- What are you talking about?
- Switzerland. The whole train. All of us.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:40.557
- Switzerland?
- You're mad. You're all raving mad.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.750
Here. North of Milano, where the track forks.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:48.478
Since the war, all traffic
goes right, into Germany.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.155
But the left fork, the old Maloja Pass
route, goes to Switzerland.

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:55.357
In a matter of hours
we could be over the border and free.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:59.911
- You know, it's possible.
- Yeah, maybe, but... Milano - that's the key.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.312
- You think we can fool 'em again?
- The engineer says there is a way.

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:09.076
On the outskirts of Milano is a control tower
at the beginning of the traffic complex.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:12.072
This tower controls the whole Milano area.

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:16.438
If we can capture it and smash the signals,
the main station, here...

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:20.672
...will not know where we are until
they repair it, but by then it will be too late.

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:23.035
We can go through Milano without stopping?

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:25.509
Yes. The engineer says it can be done.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.991
Let's move.

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:37.111
Come on! Come on!

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.871
Let's go!

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:49.511
Soon we cross back into the complex. If the
power is back on, we will show on the board.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:53.957
By then it will be full speed.
Too late for anyone to stop us.

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:51.957
- Can't this damn thing go any faster?
- Not before we reach the top of the pass.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.430
From there it's downgrade
all the way to Switzerland.

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:58.990
Shouldn't we go a bit slower?
If they've blocked the line ahead...

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:03.198
Keep it wide open. Let's move it.

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.271
Ryan.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.355
- Whether we make it or not...
- We're gonna make it, Major.

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:14.239
What I'm trying to say is
I'm sorry it had to be you with the girl.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.151
- Hey, mate, look! The Alps!
- We made it!

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.553
Now that we're over the hump, sir, Major
Fincham, I figured you'd want your stuff too.

01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.678
Pepino! Pepino!

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:26.269
Messerschmitt!

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.594
He's trying to blow the engine.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.831
Here comes his chum.

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.037
There's another one!

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.033
Oriani!

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:41.873
OK, let's go.

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:46.430
What the hell's he saying?

01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:53.591
That footbridge leads around the mountain!
It's shorter than the tunnel to the other side.

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:58.390
- Fincham, get them moving on the catwalk.
- Follow me! Everybody follow me!

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.558
Move it! Move it!

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:35.116
- Come on, lads! Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.158
All right. Back! Back to the trestle!

01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:59.193
Back!

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:11.075
Looks like they're takin' off.
Let's see those glasses.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:17.030
No wonder they're takin' off. Let's go.

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.954
What about the German
troop train back there?

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:30.429
- We have guns. We will stop them.
- Then what?

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:34.308
- He says we can replace the damaged track.
- Replace it with what?

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:37.949
It's simple. Remove track
from behind the train - put it here.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:43.433
Well, then let's get the troop train!
All those with Schmeissers, follow me!

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:17.870
This one's much too long.
Take that one there. Hurry up.

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.714
Clear this off! Clear this off! Hurry!

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.952
Pull! Pull!

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.951
Come on, hurry!

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.871
Come on, quick! That'll do it!

01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:58.949
Move it!

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.312
Come on!

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:04.153
It didn't work! Back! Back!

01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:07.911
Get back! Back!

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:05.909
Fire!

01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:15.872
Come on, come on! Get it up!
Come on, hurry!

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:27.071
Let's pull back! Back!

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.994
Watch it! Over here! Stop!

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.829
Keep down! Hold your fire!

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.069
Fire!

01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:56.034
Cease firing! Fall back!

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:15.271
- They'll try to outflank us now, huh?
- If they haven't already.

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:19.319
- Give me those grenades. I'll take some men.
- No. You're needed here.

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:28.198
Bostick, come with me.

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:48.435
Run!

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:34.477
Grenade!

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:56.191
Back!

01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.638
There they are!

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:19.432
Come on, Ryan!

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:25.029
Come on, Major! Give me your hand!

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.431
Hurry!

01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:33.636
Come on! Faster!

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:14.555
<i> I once told you, Ryan,</i>
<i>if only one gets out, it's a victory.</i>
