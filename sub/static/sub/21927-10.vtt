WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:04.748
First off, I want to
thank you both for coming.

00:04.963 --> 00:06.454
Yeah, yeah, what'd he do?

00:06.965 --> 00:08.501
Uh, he didn't do anything.

00:08.717 --> 00:11.175
Gosh, Tom,
I want to believe you.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.095
Okay, the problem is,
the curriculum here

00:14.306 --> 00:16.013
is not challenging enough
for Sheldon.

00:16.265 --> 00:17.473
Now, he gets bored

00:17.684 --> 00:20.768
and maybe doesn't
express himself

00:20.979 --> 00:22.720
in the most productive way.

00:22.940 --> 00:26.729
And so the square of sine
plus cosine equals one.

00:28.278 --> 00:28.893
Sheldon.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.478
I don't want to embarrass you,

00:30.697 --> 00:31.938
so I'm going
to give you a moment

00:32.156 --> 00:34.149
to think about
what you just said.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.072
Ms. MacElroy.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.319
What?

00:38.497 --> 00:40.363
I'm wondering if you read
the book you assigned to us,

00:40.582 --> 00:41.789
because I did.

00:42.209 --> 00:42.949
<i>20 laps.</i>

00:47.673 --> 00:48.459
Cooper.

00:48.674 --> 00:50.256
If you're going
to ask us to run,

00:50.467 --> 00:52.709
don't you think you should
lead by example?

00:56.223 --> 00:58.340
So you're saying he's being rude
to his teachers?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.926
That's unacceptable.
I'll-I'll give him a talkin' to.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.555
I don't know
if I'd call him rude.

01:02.771 --> 01:03.978
Well, put a word on it.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.355
Rude, let's go with rude.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.606
Rude is good.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.108
So what do you want us to do?

01:09.319 --> 01:12.653
I want you to consider another
approach to his education.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.439
- Okay.
- What does that mean?

01:14.658 --> 01:16.240
I recently had a nice chat
with the head

01:16.451 --> 01:18.534
of Wilmot Academy
for Gifted Children.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.495
<i>Now, I told her all about
Sheldon, and she seemed to think</i>

01:21.707 --> 01:25.075
he would be a perfect fit
over there.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.751
We already looked
into private school.

01:26.962 --> 01:27.998
We can't afford it.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.584
- Not unless you're giving me a raise.
- I'm not.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.540
Okay, just checking.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.421
<i>But I can tell you this.</i>

01:34.636 --> 01:36.377
Wilmot has been known

01:36.888 --> 01:38.880
to give children like Sheldon
full scholarship.

01:39.099 --> 01:39.839
Take a look at that.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.390
- My goodness.
- No kidding.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.184
Yeah, just read up on it.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.681
Give it some thought.

01:45.856 --> 01:46.642
<i>Hold on.</i>

01:46.857 --> 01:49.770
This place is in Dallas;
that's three hours away.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.105
Well, yeah, but, uh,

01:52.321 --> 01:53.562
<i>what they do
in cases like yours,</i>

01:53.947 --> 01:55.108
<i>they look for a local family</i>

01:55.365 --> 01:57.448
for him to live with.
And, George, Dallas?

01:58.076 --> 01:59.362
Dallas is certainly close enough

01:59.578 --> 02:00.864
that he can come home
on the weekends.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.280
Look, we appreciate

02:04.499 --> 02:06.035
you going to bat for him,
but he's just

02:06.251 --> 02:07.833
a wee little thing.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.377
We can't ship him off to Dallas.

02:09.588 --> 02:10.954
Shouldn't we talk
about this first?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.123
What's there to talk about,
George?

02:13.342 --> 02:15.254
This could be a great
opportunity for Sheldon.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.626
He's nine years old.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.132
Oh, come on, you can't measure
him in Earth years.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.134
You're saying he's an alien?

02:21.933 --> 02:22.673
<i>Well, in George's defense,</i>

02:22.893 --> 02:25.260
that idea has been
tossed around...

02:25.771 --> 02:26.602
<i>a little bit.</i>

02:27.397 --> 02:28.387
That's a bad joke.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.270
Look, I understand
this is a big decision.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.442
If you change your mind,
give me a call.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.520
I'd be more than happy
to set up an interview.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.855
- Uh, yeah. Thank you.
- You bet.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.239
Thank you.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.113
Mm-hmm.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.201
Maybe you all are the aliens.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.077
I love my job.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.479
Well, I don't understand how you
could turn this down.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.357
This place looks fantastic.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.403
It's 200 miles away, Mom.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.731
I know where Dallas is.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.816
I used to buy
my marijuana there.

03:22.035 --> 03:22.900
Really?

03:23.120 --> 03:24.201
I said "used to."

03:24.413 --> 03:25.699
Then I got pregnant
with this one

03:25.914 --> 03:27.621
and all the fun stopped.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.583
<i>All I am saying is that</i>

03:30.794 --> 03:33.457
this would be a great
opportunity for Sheldon.

03:33.672 --> 03:34.913
I know, you're right.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.668
Whoa, she's right?

03:37.092 --> 03:38.628
I said the same thing
in Petersen's office,

03:38.844 --> 03:40.210
you looked at me
like I was an idiot.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.427
Yeah, that's the look.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.676
Maybe y'all are being a
little selfish about this.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.848
Selfish? We're thinking of him.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.346
Well, that's all
well and good,

03:48.562 --> 03:51.555
but maybe you should be
thinking about the whole world.

03:51.982 --> 03:52.722
I mean,

03:52.983 --> 03:55.475
what if Einstein's parents
had held him back?

03:55.694 --> 03:57.151
We wouldn't even have the...

03:57.821 --> 03:59.153
Well, I was gonna
say atomic bomb,

03:59.364 --> 04:01.105
but there's probably
a better example.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.531
<i>Here's a crazy idea:</i>

04:02.743 --> 04:03.403
how about we ask Sheldon

04:03.618 --> 04:04.984
what he thinks of all this?

04:05.787 --> 04:08.074
Go ahead, but he's not gonna
want to go.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.452
This is his home,
we're his family.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.413
Sheldon, can you come in here
for a minute?!

04:15.630 --> 04:16.336
Yes?

04:16.673 --> 04:18.630
- Have a seat. We want to talk to you.
- All right.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.261
So, today we found out
about a school in Dallas

04:24.473 --> 04:25.509
for really smart kids.

04:25.724 --> 04:26.885
When can I start?

04:28.477 --> 04:30.434
Hold on. Dallas is far away,

04:30.645 --> 04:32.853
so you'd have to live
with another family.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.396
Do they have a dog?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.857
Uh, we don't know.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.809
Well, can you make some calls?

04:39.488 --> 04:43.232
I guess, but wouldn't you miss
your mom and dad?

04:43.742 --> 04:44.482
Oh.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.196
Yes, I suppose I will.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.202
So, when are you calling
about the dog?

04:54.419 --> 04:56.581
You know him so well.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.687
What's wrong with them?

05:19.027 --> 05:20.359
What are you
talking about?

05:20.779 --> 05:22.236
They're so quiet.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.654
Are they on medication?

05:23.865 --> 05:26.152
No, they're just
smart like you.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.402
I've been going to school
in a zoo.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.995
Not sure about
these uniforms.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.572
Kinda froufrou.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.454
Sheldon, I've been looking over
your transcripts

05:36.670 --> 05:38.787
and I must say,
I am very impressed.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.503
Thank you.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.335
What's your doctorate in?

05:42.926 --> 05:45.384
Noncommutative Algebraic
Topology.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.296
I like her.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.973
It's gonna be weird around here
without Sheldon.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.425
Don't you mean
less weird?

05:52.644 --> 05:54.101
That's not nice.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.393
I wasn't trying for nice.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.686
<i>You sure you're
not jealous</i>

05:56.898 --> 05:57.729
'cause your little brother's

05:57.941 --> 05:59.148
moving up in the world?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.850
Hey, I got plans of my own.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.901
- Do tell.
<i>- Soon as I graduate</i>

06:03.113 --> 06:06.026
high school, I'm gonna be
a professional male model.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.115
That is hilarious.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.988
What? I'm good-lookin'.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.116
No, that you think you'll
graduate high school.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.620
The model thing
was funny, too.

06:18.044 --> 06:18.704
<i>I must tell you,</i>

06:19.045 --> 06:21.082
in all the years I've been here,
I have never seen

06:21.298 --> 06:23.039
such glowing letters
of recommendation

06:23.258 --> 06:24.544
from a student's teachers.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.168
- Well, that's real nice to hear.<i>
- Now, listen to this:</i>

06:27.512 --> 06:29.595
"Putting aside his
superior intellect,

06:29.931 --> 06:32.093
"Sheldon is a delight
to have in the class.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.515
<i>"He's fun-loving,</i>

06:33.894 --> 06:35.055
"easy to get along with,

06:35.270 --> 06:37.011
and always ready to help
another student."

06:37.647 --> 06:38.854
That doesn't sound like me
at all.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.101
Sure it does, sweetie.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.182
Dr. Douglas...

06:41.401 --> 06:43.233
Oh, no. Please call me Flora.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.730
Flora, I have to ask about
the living arrangements.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.280
That's our main concern.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.278
<i>Well, I think I can
reassure you about that.</i>

06:50.535 --> 06:52.242
My husband and I have been
hosting a student

06:52.454 --> 06:54.912
for the last several years
who recently graduated

06:55.123 --> 06:56.364
and is now at Princeton.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.409
<i>So we have a guest room
available in our home.</i>

06:59.628 --> 07:01.540
That's very generous of you.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.462
Does your husband work
at the school also?

07:03.673 --> 07:04.959
<i>No, he's retired.</i>

07:05.175 --> 07:07.007
He was an astrophysicist
for NASA.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.800
Please tell me
you don't have a dog.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.802
No. We're both allergic.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.471
I'm tingling.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.936
<i>Meemaw?</i>

07:20.607 --> 07:21.472
<i>Meemaw.</i>

07:24.235 --> 07:25.396
W-Wow.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.482
I know. I look great.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.071
I got you a little
going away gift.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.318
Come on in.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.525
This necklace has been

07:32.744 --> 07:34.781
in our family
for generations.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.947
It belonged
to a Comanche warrior

07:38.166 --> 07:40.624
who gave it to your
great-great-great-great grandma.

07:40.835 --> 07:41.951
Why'd he give it to her?

07:42.170 --> 07:44.662
Well, according
to family lore,

07:44.881 --> 07:48.545
she was, uh, a very
accommodating young lady

07:48.760 --> 07:50.843
and, uh, they hit it off.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.177
That's a bird feather.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.346
- Eagle feather.
- Doesn't matter.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.423
I don't like birds;
birds are filthy.

07:56.643 --> 07:57.633
Okay.

07:58.895 --> 07:59.760
Fine.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.889
One featherless
family heirloom

08:03.108 --> 08:05.600
for you to take with you and
keep you safe while you're away.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.062
You don't actually believe this
has magic powers, do you?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.488
Oh, for God's sake,
just say "thank you."

08:11.700 --> 08:12.736
Thank you.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.076
Mmm.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.828
There's a price tag on it.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.332
No, there's not.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.798
Hello!

08:32.011 --> 08:33.128
<i>Anybody home?</i>

08:33.554 --> 08:35.672
Hi.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.510
Mary.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.302
He's gonna come home
every Friday night.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.270
I didn't think I'd have
to deal with this

08:43.481 --> 08:45.188
till he went to college.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.891
You should thank
your lucky stars

08:47.110 --> 08:49.978
he's not in college now.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.068
I'm still not sure that this
is the right thing to do.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.616
Are you worried
that he won't like it

08:55.827 --> 08:57.784
or are you worried
that he will?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.245
You're not helping.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.913
That's not my job.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.116
I think of myself as
a speaker of truth.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.246
If you're not gonna make
me feel better, go away.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.880
I'm sorry. You
are stuck with me.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.333
<i>As you can see,</i>

09:12.552 --> 09:14.043
<i>even as a small child,</i>

09:14.262 --> 09:16.219
<i>people cherished
having me around</i>

09:16.431 --> 09:18.673
<i>and wept over my absence.</i>

09:18.892 --> 09:21.805
<i>And no one took
my impending departure harder</i>

09:22.020 --> 09:24.103
<i>than my best friend, Tam.</i>

09:24.314 --> 09:25.521
So you leave tomorrow?

09:25.815 --> 09:26.680
Yes.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.478
Dallas.

09:28.818 --> 09:29.604
Yes.

09:29.819 --> 09:30.559
Cool.

09:31.613 --> 09:32.444
<i>It was touching</i>

09:32.655 --> 09:34.863
<i>to watch Tam
bravely fight back tears.</i>

09:37.202 --> 09:39.819
Have you ever thought about
making the trains go clockwise?

09:40.038 --> 09:41.154
No.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.239
You should.

09:44.876 --> 09:47.038
<i>Brave, brave Tam.</i>

09:58.056 --> 09:59.172
You awake?

10:00.225 --> 10:01.466
Yes.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.889
Are you gonna miss me?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.263
I haven't given it any thought.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.060
Well, we're just lying here.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.686
Think about it.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.776
I am used to you.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.611
I'm used to you, too.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.231
It's not the same as liking you.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.820
No.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.615
To me, you're like string beans.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.153
No one asks
for them,

10:23.373 --> 10:24.489
no one wonders about them.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.414
They're just there on the plate.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.704
But you eat them, right?

10:29.629 --> 10:30.369
Yes.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.247
You're gonna miss me.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.815
All right,
let's say grace.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.313
Guess I get
to hold hands with you now.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.987
Guess so.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.983
Maybe Sheldon's mittens
weren't such a bad idea.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.244
Thank you, God, for
this food we are about

11:04.455 --> 11:05.696
<i>to receive
and for the nourishment</i>

11:05.915 --> 11:06.996
of our bodies.
And bless

11:07.208 --> 11:08.574
<i>the hands that
prepared it.</i>

11:08.793 --> 11:11.786
And, God, we ask that you watch
over our Sheldon...

11:13.548 --> 11:16.211
as he begins
this wonderful new...

11:19.429 --> 11:21.170
...as he begins

11:21.431 --> 11:23.263
this wonderful new chapter
in his life.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.386
- Amen.
- Amen. - Mm.

11:26.936 --> 11:27.972
Why you cryin'?

11:28.313 --> 11:29.474
Why you stupid?

11:30.565 --> 11:32.227
So how'd it go in Dallas today?

11:32.483 --> 11:33.098
<i>Went fine.</i>

11:33.318 --> 11:34.274
Nice people.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.350
Sheldon seemed very comfortable

11:35.570 --> 11:36.606
with the whole thing.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.318
Welcome! How was the drive?

11:40.575 --> 11:43.909
Eh, a little traffic comin' into
the city but otherwise okay.

11:44.454 --> 11:47.037
Sheldon, I want you to
meet my husband, Elliot.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.915
Elliot, this
is Sheldon.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.662
Well, it's nice to
meet you, young man.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.369
I've heard a lot about you.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.084
<i>George, that is
not at all how they were.</i>

11:56.299 --> 11:57.335
- What are you talking about?
- There was

11:57.550 --> 11:59.633
definitely something
off about those people.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.176
Really?

12:01.721 --> 12:02.711
<i>What'd I miss?</i>

12:03.890 --> 12:04.721
Welcome!

12:05.934 --> 12:07.596
How was the drive?

12:08.686 --> 12:11.850
Eh, a little traffic comin' into
the city but otherwise okay.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.182
Sheldon,

12:14.484 --> 12:17.568
<i>I want you to meet
my husband, Elliot.</i>

12:18.112 --> 12:20.946
Elliot, this
is Sheldon.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.774
<i>Nice to meet
you, young man.</i>

12:24.202 --> 12:26.865
I've heard a lot about you.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.532
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

12:31.751 --> 12:33.913
You're making it out like
they were some kind of monsters.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.953
Sheldon has
his own room.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.083
<i>There's books
everywhere.</i>

12:37.298 --> 12:39.711
Even has a big old backyard
he won't play in.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.420
Aren't you forgetting
somethin'?

12:41.803 --> 12:42.418
What?

12:42.637 --> 12:44.503
The underground laboratory.

12:45.306 --> 12:45.966
I think it's called

12:46.182 --> 12:47.673
a finished basement, honey.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.224
I know what I saw.

12:49.978 --> 12:50.809
Mary, it's been a long day.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.431
Can we just have a quiet dinner?

12:53.189 --> 12:54.600
Sure.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.518
"Nice people."

12:59.821 --> 13:01.028
Then why did we leave him there?

13:01.239 --> 13:04.528
Because we love him and
we want the best for him.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.458
This is tense.

13:15.253 --> 13:15.868
<i>Me and the kids</i>

13:16.087 --> 13:17.248
had a nice day.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.125
Watched a lot of football.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.123
You know, the Dolphins' helmet
has a dolphin on it.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.254
And that dolphin
is also wearing a helmet.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.085
But his helmet doesn't have
a dolphin on it...

13:25.305 --> 13:26.796
it has the letter "M."

13:28.641 --> 13:31.258
We talked about that
for an hour.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.136
All right.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.431
Dig in.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.978
Excuse me.

13:39.277 --> 13:40.734
Aren't we going to say grace?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.608
Uh, we don't do that
in our house.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.488
Oh.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.487
But you're welcome to do so.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.906
That's all right.
I don't believe in God.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.154
Well, then why would you say
grace?

13:52.415 --> 13:54.498
Because it makes my mom happy.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.500
And why are you wearing
mittens?

13:56.919 --> 13:59.161
Well, I don't know
where your hands have been.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.376
Okay.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.464
Maybe we should just eat.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.347
Do you like string beans?

14:12.101 --> 14:13.137
No.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.310
But I eat them.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.942
Sheldon, can you hear me?

14:30.161 --> 14:32.699
It's your twin sister, Missy.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.408
<i>Everything's all right here,</i>

14:34.624 --> 14:37.037
but I think
Mom misses you real bad.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.921
All right, I can't hear you,

14:43.132 --> 14:44.623
so I'm gonna hang up now.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.007
<i>Good night.</i>

14:49.305 --> 14:50.921
<i>I'm telling you,
this is a terrible idea.</i>

14:51.140 --> 14:53.723
<i>- This is a terrible, terrible idea.
- He's gonna be fine.</i>

14:53.935 --> 14:55.767
<i>- You'll see.
- I can't believe you're okay with this.</i>

14:55.978 --> 14:56.968
<i>I'm not okay with this.</i>

14:57.188 --> 14:59.100
<i>I'm just trying
to be strong for you!</i>

14:59.315 --> 15:02.023
What? You thought him
leaving was a good idea.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.443
Oh, I only said that because
you thought it was a bad idea.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.192
You know how it's always
my nature to go the other way.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.272
Say "up."

15:08.616 --> 15:09.481
Up.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.698
Down.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.028
I'll see you in a bit.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.286
Where are you off to?

15:15.498 --> 15:16.909
I'm going to Dallas
to get Sheldon.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.533
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.084
What about this being
a great opportunity for him?

15:21.712 --> 15:22.543
Y'all want me to go or not?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.212
- Yes! Go!
- Yes, and hurry up!

15:24.424 --> 15:25.835
<i>Get a move on, Tubby.</i>

15:26.884 --> 15:27.499
Where you going?

15:27.718 --> 15:28.458
To get Sheldon.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.794
Do I get a vote in this?

15:30.012 --> 15:31.002
No.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.342
Dang.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.216
<i>Sleep
didn't come easy that night,</i>

15:35.435 --> 15:37.392
<i>knowing that, at any moment,</i>

15:37.770 --> 15:39.352
<i>I could be decapitated.</i>

15:40.231 --> 15:42.314
<i>And as if that
wasn't bad enough,</i>

15:42.525 --> 15:44.983
<i>the bed in my room
had a dust ruffle,</i>

15:45.194 --> 15:46.560
<i>which, to my young mind,
only meant</i>

15:46.779 --> 15:49.567
<i>There was dust.</i>

15:50.158 --> 15:52.320
<i>But, eventually,
I did drift off,</i>

15:52.618 --> 15:54.359
<i>haunted by the memory,</i>

15:54.745 --> 15:57.909
<i>the three of us
gathered around the piano</i>

15:58.291 --> 16:00.874
<i>singing hippie folk music.</i>

16:05.798 --> 16:06.663
Come on. Sing along now.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.843
<i>"You'll not see nothin'."</i>

16:20.062 --> 16:22.099
<i>Shame on whoever wrote that.</i>

16:39.832 --> 16:40.743
Dad?

16:42.126 --> 16:42.832
Yeah?

16:43.294 --> 16:45.206
I'm glad you came to get me.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.079
Me, too.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.172
No!

17:11.571 --> 17:12.733
You got my message!

17:14.075 --> 17:14.815
Hi-yah!

17:15.326 --> 17:17.613
<i>No hugging! No hugging!</i>

17:24.835 --> 17:27.373
I mean, why'd I bother
becoming a teacher?

17:27.588 --> 17:29.375
He knows what I'm gonna
say before I say it.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.707
- Or I say it and look like a dumbbell.
- Mm-hmm.

17:32.051 --> 17:32.837
Ms. Ingram,

17:33.052 --> 17:34.588
can I offer a suggestion?

17:34.929 --> 17:35.885
What?

17:36.097 --> 17:38.714
- Never mind. You do it your way.
<i>- No, no.</i>

17:38.933 --> 17:41.141
You tell me.
Tell me how I'm wrong.

17:41.352 --> 17:44.220
You assumed an extra axiom
of Euclidean geometry

17:44.438 --> 17:45.645
without stating it.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.019
<i>Was he right?</i>

17:48.234 --> 17:49.691
Course he's right.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.315
He's always right.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.862
Tell you what I do.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.234
I send him on little errands.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.281
Like the other day, I told him,

17:57.827 --> 18:00.240
"Go to the supply room
and get me a framastan."

18:00.663 --> 18:01.949
What's a framastan?

18:02.164 --> 18:03.325
No such thing. I made it up.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.790
He was gone
the whole period!

18:09.171 --> 18:10.127
That's genius.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.546
I'm using that.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.794
Don't use framastan.
That's mine.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.294
What's going on here?

18:18.097 --> 18:20.089
You said he was going away.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.180
Liar.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.016
It's 11:00 in the
morning, guys.
