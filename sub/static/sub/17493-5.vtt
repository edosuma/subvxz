00:03.760 --> 00:05.760
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

00:07.200 --> 00:09.080
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

00:11.120 --> 00:12.840
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

00:15.800 --> 00:17.840
Today, Sarah and Duck

00:17.840 --> 00:20.360
are taking the bus to the Big Shop.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.920
Beep, beep!

00:23.920 --> 00:26.520
So, what department are we visiting?

00:26.520 --> 00:28.240
Sweet section.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.040
Anything in particular?

00:30.040 --> 00:32.600
- Fudge.
- QUACK!

00:32.600 --> 00:33.760
Mmm, good choice.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.120
Huh?

00:35.120 --> 00:38.200
Ooh, that doesn't sound too promising.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.920
- DRIVER:
- The bus has broken down and will be going no further.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.360
Oh.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.480
No fudge today, Duck.

00:45.480 --> 00:49.120
'However, there will be a replacement train service.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.240
QUACK!

00:50.240 --> 00:54.080
'Anyone requiring a transfer, please see the driver. Er, Me.'

00:54.080 --> 00:55.400
Oh, come on, Duck.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.680
QUACK!

00:57.680 --> 01:01.200
Can we have a train-sfer, please?

01:01.200 --> 01:03.640
One ticket for girl and...

01:04.840 --> 01:06.720
..accompanying mallard.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.960
QUACK!

01:07.960 --> 01:11.040
- The train station is just across the park.
- Oh.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.640
You can't miss it.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.840
Thank you.

01:15.880 --> 01:19.120
Now then, what's the matter with you, dear?

01:21.880 --> 01:23.880
Ah, here it is.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.040
Oh!

01:32.040 --> 01:35.920
- ANNOUNCER:
- The Big Shop train will be departing in one minute.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.120
SARAH GASPS

01:37.120 --> 01:39.200
We'd better find our train.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.000
Duck!

01:47.000 --> 01:48.960
You need to use the ticket!

01:53.480 --> 01:56.720
Ooh! Are you all right, chap?

01:56.720 --> 01:57.880
MUFFLED QUACKS

01:57.880 --> 01:59.680
Come on, Duck.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.120
TRAIN WHISTLES

02:01.120 --> 02:02.680
Best be quick.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.560
Phew! That was close.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.920
Phew!

02:13.200 --> 02:15.480
So, where do you want to sit?

02:16.920 --> 02:18.160
Hmm.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.040
Ah, this one is best.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.240
QUACK!

02:25.240 --> 02:28.440
Ah, yes, who doesn't like a seat with a view?

02:35.880 --> 02:37.680
Ah, the snack trolley.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.360
Ooh! What do you want, Duck?

02:42.840 --> 02:44.360
Fudge!

02:44.360 --> 02:47.240
QUACK, QUACK, QUACK!

02:47.240 --> 02:50.320
- Huh?
- What a cheeky trolley.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.080
We'll just have to wait till it comes back.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.120
Hmm.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.880
Or maybe not.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.960
Wait, trolley.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.000
- QUACK!
- Whoa!

03:05.000 --> 03:06.440
Trolley?

03:06.440 --> 03:09.280
Oh, we must be in the baggage coach.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.000
- SARAH GASPS
- This way!

03:11.000 --> 03:12.600
QUACK!

03:20.960 --> 03:22.480
Where'd it go?

03:22.480 --> 03:24.680
It's a bit of a maze in here.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.400
We should have left a trail of breadcrumbs.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.840
Greedy Duck!

03:31.760 --> 03:32.960
Wha...?

03:32.960 --> 03:35.400
I'm sure that wasn't a dead end before.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.400
- It wasn't!
- Huh?

03:37.400 --> 03:39.120
What was that?

03:43.360 --> 03:45.360
- Hello!
- QUACK!

03:45.360 --> 03:48.560
- Oh!
- You've got to keep your eyes open around here.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.200
The bags like to move about.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.800
Change the maze.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.240
Well, that does explain our current predicament.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.040
We were looking for fudge.

03:59.040 --> 04:02.640
Oh, Trolley wheeled off again, has she?

04:02.640 --> 04:03.960
Uh-huh.

04:03.960 --> 04:08.360
Tell you what, I'll show you a short cut.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.520
- Ooh!
- QUACK!

04:10.520 --> 04:12.480
Ah, the trolley!

04:12.480 --> 04:15.520
- Thank you!
- Best of luck!

04:15.520 --> 04:16.960
Trolley!

04:16.960 --> 04:19.320
Oh, wait, the next carriage is the...

04:19.320 --> 04:20.800
- Trolley!
- QUACK!

04:20.800 --> 04:22.160
Wait, Sarah!

04:23.320 --> 04:25.920
I think this is the quiet carriage.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.840
SHE GASPS

04:28.840 --> 04:30.640
(Trolley!)

04:32.560 --> 04:33.680
QUACK!

04:33.680 --> 04:35.160
Ssh!

04:38.040 --> 04:39.320
(Quiet, Duck.)

04:42.440 --> 04:44.080
Careful...

04:50.080 --> 04:51.880
Phew!

04:51.880 --> 04:53.640
Oh...

05:03.000 --> 05:04.520
- Oh!
- Phew!

05:07.080 --> 05:08.600
NOISE BLARES

05:08.600 --> 05:11.280
This must be the noisy carriage!

05:11.280 --> 05:13.000
Uh-huh!

05:14.480 --> 05:16.440
BAGPIPES BLARE

05:16.440 --> 05:19.240
Any sign of that trolley?!

05:19.240 --> 05:20.960
CYMBALS CLASH

05:23.040 --> 05:24.560
Nope!

05:24.560 --> 05:26.440
TRAIN WHISTLES

05:28.320 --> 05:30.920
Oh, train in a train!

05:32.240 --> 05:33.560
Trolley?

05:33.560 --> 05:35.000
Trolley?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.160
Fudge?

05:36.160 --> 05:38.320
Fudge!

05:40.000 --> 05:41.600
Trolley?!

05:41.600 --> 05:44.600
Oops. QUACK, QUACK!

05:44.600 --> 05:45.960
SHE GASPS

05:45.960 --> 05:48.040
The trolley! Come on, Duck.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.120
Ah, there it is.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.280
Ah.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.840
Moon!

05:55.840 --> 05:58.960
Hello, I was just eating some...

05:58.960 --> 06:00.240
Fudge!

06:00.240 --> 06:03.280
Seemingly, all of it.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.480
Oh.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.560
Oh, sorry.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.400
'The next stop will be Big Shop.'

06:11.400 --> 06:16.240
Actually, they have a rather excellent fudge shop here.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.640
Oh, yeah!

06:17.640 --> 06:19.360
Let's go in.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.480
The fudge is on me.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.400
Yes, it is, rather.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.560
Oh, it is!

06:25.560 --> 06:27.200
MOON CHUCKLES

06:34.440 --> 06:35.680
Mmm.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.320
Next stop, fudge shop.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.960
Sounds good to me.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.520
- QUACK!
- Fudge!

06:45.600 --> 06:47.320
Sarah and Duck.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.960
QUACK!

06:48.960 --> 06:50.520
Sarah and Duck.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.440
QUACK!

06:52.440 --> 06:53.920
Sarah and Duck.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.400
QUACK!

06:56.400 --> 06:58.320
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!
