00:17.684 --> 00:19.823
It's almost 1:00.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.992
I'm trying to get some information here.

00:22.022 --> 00:26.664
There's something in this Mattawin
quarterly report that I can't figure out.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.674
Bill... it's not like I'm looking at porn.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.142
This is about our retirement money.

00:32.165 --> 00:35.169
Well, I wish it was porn.
It might inspire you to come to bed.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.478
I'll be there in five minutes.

00:42.809 --> 00:45.221
I got this off the web.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.350
It looks like Tuxedo Hill's hedged losses

00:47.381 --> 00:51.352
are coming back to Mattawin.
I can't understand how that happened.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.366
They've got the biggest accounting
firm in the world doing their books.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.959
I'm sure they understand how it happened.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.937
But, don't hedged losses have to
have a locked-in sales value?

00:59.960 --> 01:02.463
I've been your broker
for 10 years, and God bless you,

01:02.496 --> 01:05.306
you're the biggest pain in the ass.

01:05.331 --> 01:08.745
I'm just trying to understand what
these quarterly reports are saying.

01:08.769 --> 01:13.775
They send them to me to read,
they should make sense, no?

01:13.807 --> 01:16.310
I'm supposed to talk to my guy
at Mattawin tomorrow.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.482
I'll see what he says.

01:19.479 --> 01:22.460
Usually when brokers tell me they
have complaints from shareholders,

01:22.482 --> 01:25.554
I don't pay attention,
but Venturelli's a smart guy.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.793
Have you discussed this with anyone else?

01:27.821 --> 01:30.165
No, maybe the lawyers can come up

01:30.190 --> 01:33.171
with some language before the
next earnings estimates come out.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.867
All right, Harold, thank you.
I'll look into this.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.012
Ms. Dawson, the plumbing contractor's
calling. He's out at the house.

01:41.034 --> 01:44.538
Put him through. Thank you. Okay.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.846
The hedged losses are one thing.

01:50.877 --> 01:53.016
The bigger problem is
how the company's stock

01:53.046 --> 01:55.048
is being used to generate a gain.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.992
I'm not sure I follow.

01:59.019 --> 02:01.431
Mr. Troy, this method
of calculating earnings

02:01.455 --> 02:04.868
violates the basic tenets of accounting.
It might even be illegal.

02:04.891 --> 02:09.237
This is a missile aimed
at the heart of the company.

02:09.262 --> 02:12.004
Mattawin may implode because of it.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.171
I put it all in this memo.

02:19.172 --> 02:23.518
I think we should delay releasing our
earnings estimate until this is resolved.

02:23.543 --> 02:26.786
Thank you, Elizabeth.

02:33.186 --> 02:35.325
I finalized the earnings estimate.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.665
I'm about to send it around for signatures.

02:37.691 --> 02:41.537
Elizabeth Dawson was just in my office.
You should read this, Jack.

02:54.708 --> 02:58.178
- Thank you so much for watching her tonight.
- No problem.

02:58.211 --> 03:00.350
See you tomorrow.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.961
Aw, they're not open yet.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.989
Aw, I still got to take a leak.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.843
Hey, what are you doing here?

03:25.005 --> 03:27.485
There's a little girl over here!

03:27.507 --> 03:29.509
Where are your parents?

03:34.347 --> 03:36.918
What's this in your pocket?

03:39.686 --> 03:43.327
It's a business card for an Elizabeth Dawson.

03:43.356 --> 03:46.565
Come on, honey, let's get you warmed up.

03:48.361 --> 03:52.605
Oh, jeez. Her coat's covered in blood.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.589
She was brought in about 45 minutes ago.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.655
She hasn't said boo to anybody.

04:46.686 --> 04:48.495
Have you tried calling Ms. Dawson?

04:48.522 --> 04:51.298
We called the office number on the
card, got an answering machine.

04:51.324 --> 04:53.167
There was blood on her parka?

04:53.193 --> 04:54.968
It's not hers. She has no injuries.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.907
She just told us her name. Jennifer.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.280
Jennifer.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.254
“Jennifer Juniper.”
Your mommy ever call you that?

05:12.979 --> 05:15.960
Jennifer, do you know where your mommy is?

05:15.982 --> 05:18.929
Mommy's hurt in the head.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.926
When you were with Mommy, what did you see?

05:23.957 --> 05:26.938
Everything was dark.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.099
Were your ears working?

05:31.498 --> 05:35.469
- What did you hear?
- I heard birdies.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.539
And what about your little nose...

05:39.005 --> 05:41.485
Could you smell anything?

05:41.508 --> 05:43.613
Mommy was stinky.

05:43.643 --> 05:46.522
Well, what did she smell like?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.585
Like fireworks.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.491
They found her. Off Richmond Avenue.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.523
Four miles from the diner.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.433
She's alive. They're just
getting her out now.

06:01.461 --> 06:03.600
Her leg was trapped under the steering.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.769
Jen--

06:09.970 --> 06:12.109
- Where's her other glove?
- She wasn't wearing it.

06:12.138 --> 06:14.311
All right. Let's go.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.622
- You smell booze on her?
- No.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.628
I don't smell gunpowder in here.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.789
I didn't smell it on her either.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.800
It might have dissipated during
the time she was lying here.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.132
Or the kid made it up.

06:31.157 --> 06:33.262
Kids don't make up that stuff.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.641
Fancy mints.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.810
I want a CSU team to go through this vehicle

06:46.840 --> 06:48.979
for prints, blood, fibers.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.512
And I want Ms. Dawson
checked for gunpowder residue.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.653
Kids don't make up that stuff.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.322
The last thing I remember...

06:58.351 --> 07:02.265
I picked up Jennie from our nanny's house.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.826
I strapped her into her car seat.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.300
Then nothing.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.103
I heard Jennie crying...

07:14.834 --> 07:16.973
The car was in the ditch.

07:17.003 --> 07:19.916
How did Jennie get out?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.887
Me, I unhooked her.

07:22.909 --> 07:25.913
I thought nobody would find us.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.992
I told Jennie to go get help.

07:30.016 --> 07:33.589
She was so brave.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.760
We've been trying to locate your husband.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.704
He's in California on business.
We're getting a divorce.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.808
Where does your nanny live?

07:49.169 --> 07:51.775
Brooklyn.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.121
What were you doing on Staten Island?

07:57.143 --> 07:59.145
I don't know.

07:59.179 --> 08:02.888
You were wearing only one glove
when we found you.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.624
Do you know what happened to the other one?

08:07.420 --> 08:09.559
I don't know.

08:09.589 --> 08:12.229
I want to see Jennie.

08:12.258 --> 08:15.728
I don't know what happened.
I don't remember anything.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.412
Of course, Mr. and Mrs.
Dawson have arguments--

08:24.437 --> 08:26.417
who will have Jennie, how many days,

08:26.439 --> 08:28.578
but it was months ago.
Everything is okay now.

08:28.608 --> 08:31.418
Do you usually babysit Jennie
at your house at night?

08:31.444 --> 08:35.256
No. Mrs. Dawson, she worked late.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.421
I had to go home for my
boys, so I bring Jennie.

08:38.451 --> 08:44.163
- What was Mrs. Dawson's mood?
- Very tired.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.363
She worry a lot.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.272
- About what?
- Her husband?

08:52.265 --> 08:54.472
A boyfriend?

08:55.635 --> 08:57.774
Maybe she has a boyfriend.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.284
She doesn't talk about such things with me.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.055
But, you noticed.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.388
When does she see this guy?

09:07.414 --> 09:09.451
Weeknights, weekends?

09:09.482 --> 09:12.224
Weeknights, maybe.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.858
Weekends she goes to house
in Hamptons with Jennie.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.027
That's all I know.

09:18.758 --> 09:21.762
Okay, thank you for coming in,
Ms. Wiazemsky.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.872
The officer will show you out.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.746
Dawson has a boyfriend, identity unknown.

09:31.771 --> 09:34.047
Good for her.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.076
Her husband has a Smith & Wesson .38
special, duly licensed.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.385
We reached him in San Diego.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.551
He says Ms. Dawson kept custody of
the weapon for self-protection.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.754
Is this going somewhere?

09:43.783 --> 09:45.990
Far as I can tell, this is a car wreck.
Not our business.

09:46.019 --> 09:50.434
The lab found minute traces of
gunpowder residue on her coat.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.596
Underline minute.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.538
Ms. Dawson has no idea
how she ended up on Staten Island.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.906
Maybe the belt parkway was jammed,

09:57.931 --> 10:00.104
she decided to take the long way home.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.273
We checked traffic reports, no traffic jams.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.442
What are you saying happened here?

10:05.472 --> 10:08.112
We don't know. But the
woman has access to a gun.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.121
There's a report of a gunpowder smell.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.679
From a child.

10:11.711 --> 10:14.555
Something for the rest of the class?

10:14.581 --> 10:17.118
The mint wrapper in the ashtray.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.926
English brand, Dover's, black peppermint,

10:19.953 --> 10:24.629
very tangy. An acquired taste.
About $50 a box.

10:24.657 --> 10:27.729
Only one US distributor
with maybe a hundred customers.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.536
So she likes mints.

10:31.664 --> 10:34.804
Unless a murder victim turns up,
this is a car wreck.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.941
What about a murder weapon?

10:40.507 --> 10:43.317
Ms. Dawson had possession of a handgun

10:43.343 --> 10:45.823
licensed to someone she's
legally separated from.

10:45.845 --> 10:50.191
That's a violation right there.
And grounds for a search warrant.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.993
It's ridiculous. Ms. Dawson
wouldn't have a gun in here.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.866
She'd have to get it past security.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.372
You mean the old lady
downstairs knitting a sweater?

11:01.394 --> 11:04.170
Excuse me. I'm Karyn Milner.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.871
I'm the office manager for the division.
What's going on here?

11:06.900 --> 11:10.040
We're executing a search warrant.
The gentleman has a copy.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.447
A gun?

11:17.477 --> 11:19.855
Why on earth are you looking for a gun here?

11:19.879 --> 11:23.292
That's what we do.
We already searched her home.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.557
How well do you know Ms. Dawson?

11:25.585 --> 11:29.465
As well as anybody here.
She's a very honest person.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.799
You happen to know her boyfriend?

11:31.824 --> 11:34.566
Elizabeth rarely discusses her private life.

11:34.594 --> 11:37.074
Meaning, sometimes she does?

11:43.002 --> 11:45.243
Do you mind giving us a couple of minutes?

11:49.342 --> 11:51.481
So, what did she tell you?

11:51.511 --> 11:54.151
I mean, if she's as honest as you say she is,

11:54.180 --> 11:56.751
you shouldn't have a problem answering.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.595
A few days ago, I found her
crying in the ladies' room.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.930
She was upset because she thought

12:02.956 --> 12:05.436
her boyfriend was cheating on her.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.768
Well, any details? Boyfriend's name or...?

12:07.794 --> 12:09.933
No.

12:09.963 --> 12:13.934
I think she was embarrassed
to have even said that much.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.277
Sorry.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.475
I have to get back to my desk.

12:22.642 --> 12:25.953
Unlucky at love. I hope she plays poker.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.892
You see these invoices?

12:28.915 --> 12:31.828
Uh-huh, from a plumbing contractor,
for her house in the Hamptons.

12:31.851 --> 12:35.355
You notice the date? Labor and materials
for work done two Saturdays ago.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.959
A plumber who works weekends.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.665
When the lady of the house is in the house.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.005
"Rob Palnick, Plumbing Contractor...

12:44.030 --> 12:48.172
Tottenville." That's still
on Staten Island, isn't it?

12:50.169 --> 12:52.581
They're keeping me one
more night for observation.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.848
Well, don't rush it. We want you back at 100%.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.355
The earnings estimate has to
be filed by end of the week.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.520
We're still waiting for your signature.

13:03.549 --> 13:06.894
Jack, I told Mr. Troy I'm not signing
until certain issues are addressed.

13:06.919 --> 13:09.593
I know. He showed me your memo.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.795
You should've come to me, Elizabeth.

13:11.824 --> 13:15.237
That would've been a job-terminating move.

13:16.796 --> 13:20.175
You can't actually believe that?
not after all these years with the team.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.579
Did your assistant call you?

13:31.177 --> 13:33.453
The police searched your office this morning.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.652
I heard they also searched your home.

13:36.983 --> 13:40.260
Oh my God. I don't understand
what they're doing.

13:40.286 --> 13:44.735
You should be very careful, Elizabeth.
Get yourself a lawyer.

13:45.725 --> 13:48.501
And never forget, as much as
you help us, we can help you.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.444
Mr. Palnick, it's the police.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.917
Excuse me?

14:07.947 --> 14:10.291
Have you seen Mr. Palnick?

14:11.284 --> 14:13.457
His truck hasn't moved since Tuesday night.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.397
You saw him Tuesday?

14:15.421 --> 14:18.425
I heard him come home
around half past 10:00.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.904
Then I heard his TV go on. Nothing since.

14:41.180 --> 14:44.320
Want to take bets those are
from a .38 Smith & Wesson?

14:50.323 --> 14:52.633
I've told you, I don't remember anything.

14:52.658 --> 14:56.231
- That's not the same as denying it.
- Of course she denies it.

14:56.262 --> 14:58.708
Misplacing her husband's handgun--

14:58.731 --> 15:01.712
- deny or don't remember?
- It was in the lockbox at home.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.237
The lockbox was empty.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.750
I don't understand it.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.344
I didn't kill Rob. I couldn't.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.591
You met him while you were still married?

15:13.613 --> 15:17.117
No. After I was separated. He was...

15:17.150 --> 15:19.460
You want a mint?

15:19.485 --> 15:22.091
No, thank you.

15:22.121 --> 15:25.625
You were saying... about Rob?

15:28.294 --> 15:32.436
He was very kind, very... respectful.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.877
He made me laugh.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.938
You sure you don't want one?

15:36.969 --> 15:38.676
They're real zesty.

15:38.704 --> 15:41.844
They're English, black peppermint.

15:41.874 --> 15:45.720
I had to special order them.
I don't like peppermint.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.282
Can she go on?

15:48.314 --> 15:50.521
Sure.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.928
Uh, he made you laugh?

15:52.952 --> 15:56.331
I'm not saying it was going
to turn into anything,

15:56.355 --> 15:59.734
but... he was the only real person I knew.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.069
And the people at work, your friends--

16:02.094 --> 16:04.301
they're not real?

16:04.330 --> 16:07.038
It's different.

16:09.035 --> 16:11.208
Are you sure don't want
some mints for your daughter?

16:11.237 --> 16:13.376
She doesn't like them.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.750
I don't know why I'm talking to
you, you're not even listening.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.982
We listen. We noticed you left out the part

16:18.010 --> 16:19.990
about being upset Rob was cheating on you.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.049
What are you talking about?
Rob wasn't cheating.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.823
Somebody found you crying
in the executive washroom.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.262
- You deny--
- Yes.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.595
Or don't remember? We can help
fill in the holes for you.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.227
- You drove to Rob's place to confront him.
- No. I don't believe that.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.464
You had an argument, you lost your temper?

16:33.493 --> 16:36.440
- No, it's not possible. I'd remember that.
- Maybe you're blocking it out.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.601
- I don't--
- Enough.

16:38.631 --> 16:42.169
The next word my client says on
record, will be at her arraignment.

16:42.201 --> 16:45.307
Are you sure?

16:49.976 --> 16:52.115
Your bail can be revoked

16:52.144 --> 16:54.283
if you miss even one court appearance.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.452
I can't believe this is happening to me.

16:56.482 --> 17:00.328
Elizabeth, we can't afford to make mistakes.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.734
They have very compelling
circumstantial evidence.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.396
Now, look, I've got
to go back and talk to the ADA.

17:07.425 --> 17:11.067
- Are you going to be all right?
- Yes.

17:11.097 --> 17:13.236
Thanks.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.248
Hello, is Jack Crawley there?

17:22.275 --> 17:25.256
Can you interrupt him? It's very important.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.952
Tell him Elizabeth Dawson
needs to talk to him.

17:29.482 --> 17:33.089
I was at the station on Richmond
Avenue, near Yukon Avenue.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.929
I was filling up my car with gas,

17:35.955 --> 17:38.094
and I saw a silver SUV pull in.

17:38.124 --> 17:41.765
What direction was it coming from?
From the expressway.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.604
That young woman was driving,
the one in the newspaper.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.701
That's why I called the police
when I saw the paper.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.769
And what did the woman do?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.940
She parked near the phone booth.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.109
She used the phone, just for a minute.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.312
Then she got back in her car,
then she drove off.

17:55.341 --> 17:58.788
- What direction?
- Back where she came from.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.382
Toward the expressway to the city.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.553
This was around what time?

18:03.583 --> 18:06.223
10:00, 10:15.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.562
- Can we get you anything?
- Okay.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.903
Dawson would've been on her way to Palnick's

18:16.929 --> 18:19.068
when she pulled into the gas station.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.907
She might have tried calling him.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.072
10:15, he wouldn't have been home yet.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.311
So she turned around, headed back to the city.
This story clears her.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.916
Mr. Nelson, how did you pay for your gas?

18:32.945 --> 18:35.789
Cash-- $10. Self-serve?

18:38.117 --> 18:41.121
Which side of your car is your gas tank?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.861
You don't remember?

18:46.892 --> 18:48.963
Because someone usually
fills it up for you?

18:51.797 --> 18:54.141
You go to the full-service pump.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.974
Your hands...

19:03.309 --> 19:05.619
You keep them flat.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.319
You have arthritis?

19:12.084 --> 19:14.860
It hurts to close them?

19:16.422 --> 19:19.596
That's why you don't pump your own gas.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.732
I do when I have to.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.772
I want to pull some records on Mr. Nelson.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.087
As we head into the closing
minutes before the bell,

19:38.110 --> 19:40.090
one of the strongest performers today

19:40.112 --> 19:42.285
has been Mattawin Corporation,
now up about 3.5%.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.590
That coming on the heels
of a better than expected

19:44.617 --> 19:47.120
earnings estimate for the coming quarter.

19:47.153 --> 19:49.326
And there is the closing bell.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.131
Meaning Mattawin's closing
number for the day is 86 and 5/8.

19:52.158 --> 19:55.628
Bonus time!

19:58.364 --> 20:01.436
Congratulations, everyone.
We worked hard for this.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.606
Worked as a team.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.775
And we can enjoy the rewards as a team.

20:07.673 --> 20:12.122
We've been climbing this mountain,
some of us, for 15 years.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.488
The summit is in sight!

20:15.981 --> 20:18.222
I have been to the top of the mountain,

20:18.250 --> 20:19.695
and I'm here to tell you,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.995
the sky is even bluer than you've dreamed.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.797
If we keep up the hard work,

20:24.824 --> 20:27.134
keep believing in ourselves, in our team,

20:27.159 --> 20:30.072
we'll see those blue skies together.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.305
You'll notice we have
a few bottles of wine over here.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.781
I don't know anything about this,
but our friend Michael Gergen

20:38.804 --> 20:41.717
tells me we have some mighty fine wine.

20:42.842 --> 20:46.221
"Chateau Petrus 1946."
How much is this a bottle?

20:46.245 --> 20:49.419
- $11,000.
- Whoa!

20:49.448 --> 20:52.395
- Are you sure we'll have enough?
- I ordered five cases.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.463
Enjoy everybody.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.263
Phone booth records show a one-minute call

21:02.294 --> 21:04.900
to Palnick's number at 10:17.
The gas station records

21:04.930 --> 21:08.434
show a sale of $10 worth
of gas at around the same time.

21:08.467 --> 21:11.676
The old guy's story checks out.
Ms. Dawson's off the hook.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.583
Charles Berke will be happy.

21:16.142 --> 21:19.589
- Who's Charles Berke?
- He works at Mattawin. Same as Ms. Dawson.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.819
He's an accountant.

21:21.847 --> 21:25.317
Oh-- and he's our witness' son-in-law.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.293
What's the implication here?

21:32.324 --> 21:34.634
That Mattawin's trying
to help a key executive?

21:34.660 --> 21:36.765
Except Nelson's story checks out.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.208
There was a call to Palnick from
the phone at the gas station.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.302
There was a sale of $10 worth of gas.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.405
Then it's a coincidence Mr.
Nelson's son-in-law works for Mattawin.

21:44.436 --> 21:47.144
Except the cashier doesn't
remember Mr. Nelson.

21:47.173 --> 21:50.882
Someone bought $10 worth of gas, but
it might not have been Mr. Nelson.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.049
Is it possible Ms. Dawson did?

21:53.078 --> 21:55.422
That she was laying
the groundwork for her alibi

21:55.447 --> 21:57.688
on her way to killing Mr. Palnick?

21:57.716 --> 22:01.596
We showed her photo to the cashier.
He doesn't remember her or her SUV.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.226
Well, if not Ms. Dawson,
nor Mr. Nelson, then who?

22:04.256 --> 22:06.759
We have no idea.

22:06.792 --> 22:10.763
Except the same day
that Mr. Nelson came to see us,

22:10.796 --> 22:13.299
Mattawin's stock price jumped up 3.5%.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.404
That would make it two coincidences.

22:16.435 --> 22:19.075
One more and it's a conspiracy.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.112
We issued a favorable earnings estimate.

22:25.144 --> 22:28.284
Simple as that. Didn't your
friends at the SEC tell you?

22:28.314 --> 22:30.419
- They did.
- Well, they were right.

22:30.449 --> 22:33.953
They also told us you filed the
estimate on the last possible day.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.125
Was there a problem getting it out?

22:36.155 --> 22:40.126
No, just our legal department
doing the usual due diligence.

22:40.159 --> 22:44.505
Our friends at the SEC sent
us a copy of the estimate.

22:45.998 --> 22:50.504
There's a list of signatures at
the end-- the first name's yours.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.607
Because I'm the CFO.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.113
That's the Chief Financial Officer.

22:58.143 --> 23:01.181
That's right. CFO, CEO...

23:01.213 --> 23:04.387
VPCF.

23:04.416 --> 23:08.922
- I'm not familiar with that acronym.
- Oh, I just made it up.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.491
Yeah, Vice President of Corporate Finance.

23:13.325 --> 23:16.272
That's what Elizabeth Dawson is.

23:16.295 --> 23:19.037
Her signature's on here, too.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.941
It's required by the SEC.

23:20.966 --> 23:23.446
Even though she's accused of murder?

23:23.469 --> 23:26.712
There is a presumption of innocence.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.083
What happens if,

23:29.108 --> 23:31.952
for some reason, Ms. Dawson hadn't signed?

23:31.977 --> 23:34.924
Well then, we couldn't file
the earnings estimate,

23:34.947 --> 23:37.393
and the SEC would want to know why.
There'd be an inquiry.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.421
That's what our friends at the SEC told us.

23:42.821 --> 23:45.097
I tried to read this.

23:45.124 --> 23:48.196
You guys, you make a lot of money.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.505
What is it exactly Mattawin does?

23:53.532 --> 23:56.138
We buy and sell land and water rights.

23:56.168 --> 23:58.512
Buy and sell, land and water

23:58.537 --> 24:00.710
Pretty much covers everything.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.348
It seems that most of your profits

24:04.376 --> 24:08.017
came from your investment
in something called Tuxedo Hill.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.283
Is that some kind of land development?

24:11.317 --> 24:14.127
No. Do you mind?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.525
Just...

24:18.624 --> 24:21.605
- The blueprint for a house?
- Yes.

24:21.627 --> 24:24.938
- Antigua-- is that offshore?
- That's offshore.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.103
I know that's a dirty word these days.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.203
You must be doing well, Mr. Crawley.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.305
I'm not in this for my health.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.311
Are we done here?

24:36.976 --> 24:40.788
Uh-- no. What is Tuxedo Hill?

24:40.813 --> 24:44.920
Our friends at the SEC, they
couldn't tell us anything about it.

24:44.950 --> 24:46.987
The Tuxedo Hill Group

24:47.019 --> 24:49.329
is a special purpose partnership

24:49.355 --> 24:52.063
capitalized by third-party equity
to hedge certain Mattawin assets.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.200
We have no idea what you just said.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.834
I don't have time to give a primer
on capital assets management.

24:58.864 --> 25:01.174
So, if you'll excuse me?

25:01.200 --> 25:03.271
Look at that water.

25:04.937 --> 25:07.577
Is this off the coast of Antigua?

25:07.606 --> 25:10.018
Uh, yeah.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.249
It's paradise.

25:13.612 --> 25:16.718
This is that gorgeous woman
that we met last time, Karyn--

25:16.749 --> 25:19.821
- Karyn Milner.
- Karyn Milner-- Karyn Milner.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.332
Was this at a company picnic?

25:22.354 --> 25:25.062
Uh, no. Ms. Milner and I are engaged.

25:25.090 --> 25:28.071
Now you know the big secret
around the water cooler.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.233
I don't know where that match was made,

25:31.263 --> 25:33.402
but it wasn't in heaven.
What a snake-oil merchant.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.605
The snake oil he's selling is Tuxedo Hill.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.773
He wasn't anxious to give us the recipe.

25:37.803 --> 25:40.613
Well, maybe there's a place
we can find the ingredients--

25:40.639 --> 25:43.313
Internet chat rooms for stock pickers.

25:46.311 --> 25:50.123
I've been trying for a month to get a
straight answer about Tuxedo Hill.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.288
The whole thing doesn't make sense.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.126
Tuxedo Hill's supposed
to use third-party equity--

25:55.187 --> 25:57.793
outside investors—to
protect Mattawin's assets.

25:57.823 --> 26:01.566
But to me, it doesn't look like
those assets are being covered.

26:01.593 --> 26:03.732
And the company rep
told my broker, "Don't worry,

26:03.762 --> 26:06.470
it's probably just an accounting mistake."

26:06.498 --> 26:08.944
Your broker was happy with that explanation?

26:08.967 --> 26:11.447
He told me the company
rep even brought it up

26:11.470 --> 26:13.609
with the VP of Corporate Finance.

26:13.639 --> 26:16.210
Elizabeth Dawson.

26:16.241 --> 26:19.017
Yes, he said she was going to follow up on it.

26:19.044 --> 26:21.320
I don't know what you're
worried about, Mr. Winnick.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.826
Mattawin stock keeps going up.

26:23.849 --> 26:25.988
Yeah, sure, except
I got a little crystal ball

26:26.018 --> 26:28.157
called the credit-protection market.

26:28.187 --> 26:31.259
It's where banks and big lenders go
to buy insurance on their loans.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.237
And the price of insurance on loans
to Mattawin has been going up.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.399
Banks see Mattawin as a bad credit risk?

26:37.429 --> 26:41.605
But are they going to tell
the average man? No way.

26:41.633 --> 26:45.376
These bastards. They're like a bunch
of frat boys playing crooked poker,

26:45.404 --> 26:47.975
only they're using our money.

26:50.976 --> 26:54.446
Maybe some subpoenas will
get us a seat at that poker game.

26:55.481 --> 26:59.429
I looked at all the filings, disclosures
and offerings. The bottom line is,

26:59.451 --> 27:03.228
these outside investors Tuxedo Hill's
supposed to have, they don't exist.

27:03.255 --> 27:06.327
The investors are Mattawin executives
and board members using Mattawin stock.

27:06.358 --> 27:08.998
I don't understand.

27:09.027 --> 27:11.098
All you need to know is,
Mattawin uses Tuxedo Hill

27:11.130 --> 27:15.135
to hide losses and generate paper profits--
which they count as actual profits.

27:15.167 --> 27:18.944
To boost Mattawin stock prices.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.542
Look at it this way, they're taking
air out of the Mattawin balloon,

27:21.573 --> 27:25.111
to fill the Tuxedo Hill balloon, which is
being used to fill the Mattawin balloon.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.818
- They're just pushing hot air around.
- A Ponzi scheme.

27:27.846 --> 27:32.454
Close. The numbers are big--
hundreds of millions.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.623
And this is what they needed
Ms. Dawson to sign off on?

27:34.653 --> 27:37.759
Then it's time to go after
Mattawin and Tuxedo Hill.

27:37.789 --> 27:41.202
And all the other entities
they spun out of Tuxedo Hill.

27:41.226 --> 27:44.605
There's a dozen other companies,
one for each category of assets.

27:44.630 --> 27:48.100
You got mineral rights, residential
real estate, transportation--

27:48.133 --> 27:50.909
- "PoolTrans."
- For Mattawin's fleet.

27:50.936 --> 27:53.143
Cars, trucks, small boats--

27:53.172 --> 27:56.119
We need a search warrant for a private jet.

27:57.242 --> 28:01.156
The DA got every piece of paper
from the regulatory agencies.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.286
Legal says the next wave of subpoenas
will come by the end of the week.

28:04.349 --> 28:07.489
This time, they'll be knocking on our door.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.159
I want to make it clear we
intend to comply with any subpoena.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.329
- Give them everything we have.
- I understand perfectly, Jack.

28:13.358 --> 28:16.362
Everything we have when they
hand us the subpoena.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.545
We'll need to see your
flight manifest for that week.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.778
It's aboard the plane.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.723
- It's a tight fit.
- Fine for me.

28:37.749 --> 28:41.925
Yeah, Tuesday morning I picked up two
passengers in Memphis and flew them here.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.764
- Arrival time was 8:30.
- And Tuesday night?

28:44.790 --> 28:47.600
Back to Memphis with the same two gentlemen.

28:47.626 --> 28:51.199
Departure time was 1:20 a.m.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.609
It's a tight fit in here.
Do you have any mints?

28:54.633 --> 28:56.874
Uh...

28:56.902 --> 28:58.939
Who were these two gentlemen?

28:59.004 --> 29:01.245
Mattawin employees.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.549
- The names aren't noted on the manifest?
- No.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.818
We had instructions to
pick them up in Memphis.

29:06.845 --> 29:09.382
It's Dover's.

29:10.916 --> 29:15.524
These are the Rolls-Royce of mints.
I thought you might stock these.

29:16.588 --> 29:21.003
PoolTrans was on the customer
list the distributor sent us.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.067
What's he going to do?

29:25.097 --> 29:27.441
Look for evidence you
transported two murderers.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.585
She has no memory of pulling
into that gas station.

29:38.610 --> 29:42.752
But, if that's what your witness
said she did, that's what she did.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.261
And the murder charge should be set aside.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.787
That's up to my counterpart on Staten Island.

29:47.819 --> 29:50.493
My concern is something else entirely.

29:50.522 --> 29:53.128
And what is that?

29:55.027 --> 29:57.200
Quid pro quo.

29:57.229 --> 30:01.200
One hand washing the other...?

30:01.233 --> 30:03.941
Mattawin's earnings estimate.

30:06.004 --> 30:08.848
It's your signature.

30:11.777 --> 30:14.656
You traded it for a witness

30:14.680 --> 30:17.388
who'd get you off the hook.

30:19.751 --> 30:22.027
If you're implying
she was suborning perjury--

30:22.054 --> 30:25.592
We know why you wouldn't sign
in the first place.

30:25.624 --> 30:28.298
You knew that Mattawin

30:28.327 --> 30:32.537
was using Tuxedo Hill to "cook the books."

30:35.667 --> 30:39.672
You tried to do the ethical thing...

30:39.705 --> 30:41.707
Then along came this murder rap.

30:41.740 --> 30:44.016
They offered to help you.

30:44.042 --> 30:46.784
"Witness-in-a-can"--
as long as you signed this.

30:48.046 --> 30:50.117
Elizabeth, we don't have to listen to this.

30:50.148 --> 30:53.527
No. They're right.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.125
We are such a crooked company,
we deserve to get caught.

30:59.791 --> 31:04.262
I knew in my gut that I hadn't killed Rob,

31:04.296 --> 31:07.766
but I was desperate.
I was thinking of Jennie.

31:08.767 --> 31:11.247
I called Jack Crawley.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.815
I swear, I did not kill Rob.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.549
We happen to believe you.

31:20.579 --> 31:26.461
It's the mints-- the ones
that you don't like.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.800
The ones from the company jet.

31:30.822 --> 31:33.302
We found the same wrapper in your truck.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.464
Somebody left it there.

31:35.494 --> 31:38.907
The same somebody who knocked you
unconscious outside your nanny's house,

31:38.930 --> 31:41.809
who rolled your car into the ditch--

31:41.833 --> 31:44.109
Who stole the gun from your home...

31:44.136 --> 31:47.242
And shot Rob Palnick.

31:48.306 --> 31:51.810
They planted just enough
evidence to implicate you.

31:51.843 --> 31:55.814
And just enough evidence
to form the basis for an alibi.

31:55.847 --> 31:59.420
You were damned with one
hand and saved with the other,

31:59.451 --> 32:03.263
just to get your signature
on a piece of paper.

32:09.861 --> 32:13.172
Those sons of bitches.

32:15.233 --> 32:20.444
But, we're curious as to the motive
of their financial shenanigans.

32:20.472 --> 32:23.351
Was it to increase the value
of their Mattawin stock?

32:23.375 --> 32:26.822
That wouldn't help them.
They have stock options.

32:26.845 --> 32:30.725
They're locked in. They can't sell
them without letting the SEC know.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.820
And then that would start
a run on the company.

32:32.851 --> 32:35.297
No, it had to be the bonuses.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.824
They get bonuses every time
Mattawin stock hits a target price.

32:41.827 --> 32:44.034
How much, these bonuses?

32:44.062 --> 32:47.805
Walter Troy got $10.5 million.

32:47.833 --> 32:50.643
Jack Crawley, $7.5.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.979
Michael Gergen, $3.3--

32:53.004 --> 32:56.508
for this, they killed Rob!

32:56.541 --> 32:59.784
He never did anything to them.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.382
What were they thinking?!

33:06.184 --> 33:09.563
I doubt they gave it any thought at all.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.772
We need to pry this murder conspiracy apart.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.935
Elizabeth Dawson alone won't get us there.

33:19.965 --> 33:21.603
Her credibility is tainted.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.613
We need another way to get to Jack Crawley.

33:23.635 --> 33:26.445
So far he's been able to insulate himself.

33:26.471 --> 33:29.645
There might be one thing
he left flapping in the wind.

33:33.144 --> 33:35.283
It's what I told you the first time.

33:35.313 --> 33:37.452
She was in the bathroom, she was crying.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.792
She thought her boyfriend was cheating on her.

33:39.818 --> 33:42.958
- Don't you people take notes?
- Ms. Dawson says it never happened.

33:44.322 --> 33:46.495
Why would I lie about something like that?

33:47.826 --> 33:50.067
To make her look guilty.

33:50.095 --> 33:53.076
To give her a motive for
killing her boyfriend.

33:53.098 --> 33:55.442
And why in the world would I do that?

33:55.467 --> 33:58.641
Because your fiancé,
Jack Crawley, asked you to.

33:58.670 --> 34:03.210
Jack is the smartest, most
dedicated man I have ever met.

34:03.241 --> 34:05.414
He built Mattawin into a winner

34:05.443 --> 34:08.981
through hard work and pure business genius.

34:09.014 --> 34:11.460
Not to mention a little smoke, a few mirrors.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.621
If I had any doubts about Mattawin,

34:13.652 --> 34:17.793
I wouldn't have invested my savings, nor
that of my parents, into the company.

34:19.623 --> 34:22.605
That's a cute dog. isn't it cute?

34:22.627 --> 34:25.835
- What's his name?
- Ebit.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.275
Ebit.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.302
Is that because he's such...

34:31.469 --> 34:33.949
An itty-bitty, little doggy?

34:33.972 --> 34:36.110
No. Jack came up with it.

34:36.141 --> 34:38.280
He said it's the first thing
you learn in business school.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.551
It's short for "EBITDA"--
"Earnings before interest,

34:40.579 --> 34:42.650
taxes, depreciation"--

34:42.681 --> 34:45.525
"...amortization."

34:50.322 --> 34:54.202
Look at this collar.
It's diamonds. It's stunning.

34:54.225 --> 34:57.672
Yes. Jack surprised me with it.

34:57.696 --> 35:00.199
Well, he has excellent taste.

35:00.231 --> 35:03.371
Yes. But I nearly spoiled the surprise.

35:03.401 --> 35:05.472
How's that?

35:05.503 --> 35:09.576
I walked in on him when he
was ordering it on the phone.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.918
Really? What did you hear him say?

35:11.943 --> 35:14.719
I heard him say that he
wanted to buy a collar.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.254
That's funny.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.788
You heard him on the phone buying a collar.

35:22.821 --> 35:26.894
What's so funny about that?
He was ordering it from a catalog.

35:31.096 --> 35:34.942
Diamonds and dogs. All the
best friends a girl needs.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.947
Crawley bought a lot of collars
the last six months.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.607
He did?

35:39.638 --> 35:41.447
We need material witness warrants

35:41.473 --> 35:44.113
for Jack Crawley and Karyn Milner.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.816
We're throwing them an engagement party.

35:49.047 --> 35:52.620
Well, I made it clear I was happy to
cooperate with your investigation.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.791
The witness warrant was unnecessary.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.494
It was the DA's idea. What can I say?

35:59.658 --> 36:01.797
Please, have a seat.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.902
The questions that I have for you...

36:08.233 --> 36:11.112
Have to do with the way
Mattawin calculates earnings.

36:11.136 --> 36:14.276
I don't know anything about that.
I'm not an accountant.

36:14.305 --> 36:17.013
I don't understand what you need to--

36:18.610 --> 36:21.591
- What's Jack doing here?
- Just listen, Ms. Milner.

36:21.613 --> 36:24.423
... and about the questions being raised

36:24.449 --> 36:26.224
on the way Mattawin calculates profits.

36:26.251 --> 36:28.925
The District Attorney, and the SEC,

36:28.953 --> 36:31.934
they'll all have their accountants,
and we'll have ours.

36:31.956 --> 36:34.163
It'll be "dueling accountants."

36:34.192 --> 36:36.433
And you're saying that you don't understand

36:36.461 --> 36:38.941
how Mattawin calculates earnings?

36:38.963 --> 36:41.443
No, I'm saying that I rely

36:41.466 --> 36:43.605
on what the accountants and auditors tell me.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.706
And they told me it was appropriate.

36:45.737 --> 36:49.082
Don't you read your own financial statements?

36:49.107 --> 36:52.111
I'll let you in on corporate
America's dirty secret--

36:52.143 --> 36:55.613
financial statements are Rubik's Cubes.

36:55.647 --> 36:59.754
Confusion and mystery
are built into the design.

36:59.784 --> 37:03.231
They are meant to be inscrutable, unknowable.

37:03.254 --> 37:07.669
Then how does a guy like me
know what stocks to buy?

37:07.692 --> 37:10.798
Ask your Aunt Minnie.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.900
She knows as much as anyone.

37:12.931 --> 37:16.606
The market is 20% perception, 80% emotion.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.807
Do you think that high tech crashed

37:18.837 --> 37:22.307
because people stopped using
computers? No. It was fear.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.786
It was a bubble.

37:24.809 --> 37:27.085
My dear Detective, it's all a
bubble-- the Dow, the NASDAQ,

37:27.112 --> 37:29.422
the AMEX, it's all one big bubble

37:29.447 --> 37:33.486
that floats on the dreams
and ambitions of every American.

37:33.518 --> 37:36.089
It may contract, it may expand,

37:36.121 --> 37:38.260
but it will never burst,

37:38.289 --> 37:41.793
because of the ingenuity
of the American capitalist.

37:44.963 --> 37:48.570
Wow, you've given me a lot
to think about, Mr. Crawley.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.976
I'll be right back.

38:00.311 --> 38:02.723
This is a smart man you're marrying.

38:02.747 --> 38:04.886
I know.

38:05.884 --> 38:08.694
Would you like to join him?
We're almost done.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.859
Yes, I'd like to.

38:21.399 --> 38:23.538
Have a seat.

38:23.568 --> 38:25.912
We just have a few things to cover.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.913
Ms. Milner heard what you had to say,

38:32.944 --> 38:38.053
and I imagine she had much
the same reaction as I do.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.290
Your words...

38:44.122 --> 38:46.159
Filled me with confidence.

38:46.191 --> 38:49.331
If I had money right now, I'd buy
Mattawin stock. Wouldn't you?

38:49.360 --> 38:51.033
Without a doubt.

38:52.463 --> 38:55.774
That's why you invested
your pension in Mattawin.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.940
You work for a company,
you invest in the company.

38:58.970 --> 39:02.042
- I'm sure all the employees did.
- Of course.

39:02.073 --> 39:04.883
Because management encouraged
you to buy stock--

39:04.909 --> 39:09.016
to lock in the pension plan
in the company's bright future.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.186
Yes.

39:13.785 --> 39:17.460
And you-- you own millions of
dollars of Mattawin stock options?

39:17.488 --> 39:20.628
I don't keep track of their exact worth.

39:20.658 --> 39:22.934
Ts-sss...

39:23.928 --> 39:26.067
But you hold on to those stocks

39:26.097 --> 39:28.703
because, you know, you believe in the company.

39:30.435 --> 39:33.416
And if you sold them,
you'd have to report it to the SEC,

39:33.438 --> 39:36.248
and that would send a terrible signal

39:36.274 --> 39:38.754
out into the investment community.

39:38.776 --> 39:40.722
Yes.

39:40.745 --> 39:42.884
And the only reason why you'd sell

39:42.914 --> 39:47.624
is if you thought Mattawin was in
serious trouble-- which it isn't.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.291
That's correct.

39:57.462 --> 40:01.501
Your fiancée told us you bought
a collar a few months ago.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.782
A dog collar for her dog.

40:13.811 --> 40:17.691
Oh-- yes, no-- of course.

40:19.050 --> 40:22.293
You thought I was talking
about another collar, didn't you?

40:22.320 --> 40:24.732
No, I don't-- no.

40:31.829 --> 40:34.639
It's another new expression
that I've learned--

40:35.667 --> 40:37.806
"buying a collar."

40:37.835 --> 40:41.612
Do you want to explain
to your fiancée what it means?

40:43.841 --> 40:46.117
Maybe I should.

40:46.144 --> 40:49.648
It means collaring your
position on your stock options.

40:49.681 --> 40:53.823
It's a quiet way of dumping your stocks

40:53.851 --> 40:57.594
without sending up a flare
as to what you’re doing.

41:04.329 --> 41:08.607
It's something you've done
a lot of the last six months.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.876
In fact...

41:16.307 --> 41:19.151
You've sold all your Mattawin stock...

41:20.144 --> 41:24.320
For a net profit of $73 million.

41:28.353 --> 41:30.629
He didn't tell you?

41:32.991 --> 41:35.665
Maybe he was waiting for your wedding night.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.334
You sold it all?

41:39.364 --> 41:41.776
Karyn...

41:41.799 --> 41:44.780
You told me to put everything
I had into the company--

41:44.802 --> 41:46.941
everything my parents had.

41:46.971 --> 41:49.110
And all this time you've been selling?

41:49.140 --> 41:51.279
It doesn't matter. We'll be married.

41:51.309 --> 41:54.654
After he makes you sign a pre-nup.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.629
You bastard.

42:01.652 --> 42:04.758
You weasel!

42:04.789 --> 42:06.894
You never even cared about me!

42:06.924 --> 42:09.234
No! No!

42:09.260 --> 42:11.433
He told me to lie to you about Elizabeth.

42:11.462 --> 42:13.772
He set her up!

42:13.798 --> 42:16.472
He said that she wasn't a team player!

42:19.203 --> 42:21.342
A team player?

42:21.372 --> 42:24.251
Yeah-- the team was a lie.

42:25.309 --> 42:27.789
A lie.

42:32.817 --> 42:35.730
Well. Put your hands behind your back, please.

42:35.753 --> 42:38.097
No, look, I can give you names.

42:38.122 --> 42:41.433
Too late. There's the closing bell

42:42.427 --> 42:45.636
The Memphis people. I can get you their names.

42:45.663 --> 42:47.802
Jack Crawley, you're under arrest for murder.

42:47.832 --> 42:49.641
No-- look, I'll give you Walter Troy,

42:49.667 --> 42:51.305
and Michael Gergen. Gergen knew!

42:51.335 --> 42:53.645
Your trading days are over, Mr. Crawley.

42:53.671 --> 42:57.949
No! No, look, you're going to need me!

42:57.975 --> 42:59.977
And what can you offer
to make up for the misery

43:00.011 --> 43:03.185
you prepared to wreak on thousands
of people who trusted you?

43:03.214 --> 43:05.353
What fanatics do to us with guns and bombs,

43:05.383 --> 43:07.522
you tried to do with an accounting trick!

43:07.552 --> 43:09.589
Don't you think for a minute

43:09.620 --> 43:11.497
that you deserve anything better than they do.

43:20.531 --> 43:23.273
I'm going to make an
announcement to the press...

43:23.301 --> 43:26.043
And then I'm going to call my broker.
