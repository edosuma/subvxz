WEBVTT

00:03.255 --> 00:04.499
Detective Mackey.

00:04.631 --> 00:07.632
Hey, weren't you supposed
to meet me here to suck my dick?

00:07.672 --> 00:12.045
I hope you all made it.
I wanted to speak to you one last time.

00:12.468 --> 00:15.628
You better talk to your brother
before you start making death threats.

00:15.668 --> 00:18.863
I've already taken care of my brother.

00:18.994 --> 00:22.474
And now… you've
been greenlit.

00:25.232 --> 00:27.592
Department of Corrections
just sent this over.

00:27.632 --> 00:30.823
When were you planning on telling me
about Armadillo's death threat?

00:30.863 --> 00:33.254
Relax. Cops get
greenlit all the time.

00:33.294 --> 00:35.736
It's just talk.
Nothing ever happens.

00:35.853 --> 00:40.867
Armadillo had his own brother killed. If there's
one guy who'd be the exception, it's him.

00:40.907 --> 00:44.706
Look at the bright side. This tape serves up
Armadillo for accessory to murder…

00:44.746 --> 00:47.105
and conspiracy to kill
a police officer.

00:47.145 --> 00:49.440
–All we gotta do is find him.
–Before he finds you.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.528
Not a problem.

00:51.561 --> 00:54.723
About the minority
on the Strike Team, Vic.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.086
I've got a candidate
I want you to meet.

00:57.126 --> 00:59.329
Sure. Send him by anytime.

00:59.525 --> 01:03.746
Vic… make sure you
and your guys watch your backs.

01:05.123 --> 01:07.773
Yeah.

01:07.970 --> 01:11.257
–Why does Aceveda want
to bring on another guy?
–It's a quota thing.

01:11.297 --> 01:14.008
We need color on the team,
so the brass can feel better…

01:14.048 --> 01:15.992
about underpaying
their Mexican gardeners.

01:16.032 --> 01:18.905
Taking on a new guy…
This means one of us gets booted?

01:18.945 --> 01:22.245
No. It means we go from four to five.
Have a seat.

01:25.948 --> 01:28.151
I, uh…

01:28.315 --> 01:31.478
I'm sorry about this
Armadillo heat.

01:31.610 --> 01:33.521
It's my shit.
It should be on me.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.369
I never meant to get
you guys on a hit list.

01:36.409 --> 01:38.513
Hey, we're a team, right?

01:38.648 --> 01:40.655
–Yeah, right.
–Right.

01:40.791 --> 01:44.783
So, um, Armadillo's saying
you're greenlit.

01:44.982 --> 01:49.074
Is that like you in a plural sense
or you in a singular sense?

01:50.581 --> 01:55.993
No. It's just… I was on the porch the whole
time. I mean, he didn't really see me.

01:57.362 --> 02:01.256
Don't worry about it.
We'll find him before he gets to any of us.

02:01.296 --> 02:03.271
What about this new team member?

02:03.311 --> 02:06.119
Someone who doesn't understand
how we do things…

02:06.159 --> 02:08.997
could throw a wrench
into how we do things.

02:09.038 --> 02:12.197
I'm not bringing anyone on
unless they understand.

02:12.237 --> 02:16.491
How are the wedding plans
coming along?

02:16.651 --> 02:18.374
Good.

02:19.882 --> 02:22.721
Look, I'm not gonna say
anything to Vanessa…

02:22.761 --> 02:24.484
you know, about things.

02:24.681 --> 02:26.785
It's not my place.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.643
Thank you.

02:28.775 --> 02:32.767
It's just that if she hears from somebody else
though, you know, or if you slip…

02:32.807 --> 02:36.155
she's gonna be hurt
really bad.

02:36.325 --> 02:38.463
I'm not going to slip.

02:40.516 --> 02:43.897
That's us.
Washburn Terrace.

02:44.067 --> 02:46.946
–What's the call?
–911 hang-up.

02:46.979 --> 02:51.467
Some three year old probably
just learned how to use the speed dial.

02:53.823 --> 02:55.644
What's up?

02:55.839 --> 02:59.100
I need you to put guys
on my wife and kids 24/7.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.432
You think
she's seeing someone?

03:01.597 --> 03:03.261
It's not about that.

03:03.294 --> 03:06.579
But if she is seeing someone,
you want to know about it, right?

03:06.619 --> 03:11.189
Look, I've been putting a dent
in this Mexican banger's drug trade.

03:11.738 --> 03:15.728
He made a threat. I gotta make sure
he stays away from my wife and kids.

03:15.768 --> 03:17.647
–I'll put my best guys on it.
–And one more thing.

03:17.687 --> 03:21.038
Corrine can't know you're watching.
You're invisible. You got it?

03:21.078 --> 03:22.801
Got it.

03:26.485 --> 03:28.208
Julien.

One-Tango-13 requesting backup.
We have a forced entry.

03:39.888 --> 03:42.342
Roger that, One-Tango-13.

03:48.301 --> 03:50.635
Oh, Jesus.

04:01.897 --> 04:05.472
One-Tango-13. We have a 187.
Requesting additional backup and an R.A.

04:05.512 --> 04:09.274
Roger, One–Tango-13.
Sending additional units and an R.A.

04:20.642 --> 04:21.788
God.

04:23.329 --> 04:26.893
It's a battered woman's shelter.
Go to the other side.

05:38.313 --> 05:41.629
It's okay. Come here.
It's okay. Come to me.

05:43.208 --> 05:44.996
It's okay.

05:58.531 --> 06:00.444
–You got everything you need?
–Yeah.

06:00.484 --> 06:03.766
–Stop it!
–Let me see it.

06:07.135 --> 06:09.371
–No, I like that open.
–Stop it!

06:09.439 --> 06:12.024
Cassidy. You still
locking up at night?

06:12.318 --> 06:14.358
–Of course.
–Cassidy, stop!

06:14.494 --> 06:17.940
–Okay!
–I'm putting a new alarm system in the house.

06:18.140 --> 06:21.400
–Why now?
–'Cause with me not here…

06:21.563 --> 06:25.193
it's the only way you and the kids
are gonna feel safe.

06:27.832 --> 06:31.127
Yeah. Where is it?

06:31.288 --> 06:34.004
Private shelter
for battered women.

06:34.071 --> 06:37.710
They decide to leave their abuser.
They call a 1-800 number.

06:37.750 --> 06:41.446
Get picked up, brought here.
Location's never given out.

06:41.588 --> 06:44.030
Looks like
the wrong person found it.

06:44.053 --> 06:47.019
As far as I'm concerned,
there's only six suspects.

06:47.059 --> 06:49.392
–A boyfriend or a husband.
–Yeah.

06:49.553 --> 06:51.789
No I.D's anywhere
in the house.

06:51.921 --> 06:55.592
These places usually issue aliases,
collect the women's wallets.

06:55.632 --> 06:58.854
–Looks like he found them.
–He spent time in the house after.

06:58.894 --> 07:01.637
Cut the power.
Snatched the closed-circuit videotape.

07:01.677 --> 07:04.972
This is more premeditated
than blackout rage.

07:25.702 --> 07:27.425
Any of the kids talk?

07:27.621 --> 07:30.044
The child psychologist will
let us know when they're ready.

07:30.084 --> 07:31.998
Ma'am, you can't go in there.

07:32.068 --> 07:34.171
–I'm Emma Prince, director of this shelter.
–Step back!

07:34.211 --> 07:37.247
–Can I help?
–I live here. I run this shelter.

07:37.474 --> 07:39.230
I'm sorry.

07:39.425 --> 07:42.741
–I have to get inside.
–It's pretty bad.

07:42.912 --> 07:47.035
I left for a few hours to pick
up some clothing donations.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.461
They're all dead?

07:50.621 --> 07:53.784
–What about the children?
–They're okay.

07:56.316 --> 07:59.251
We're gonna need some help
identifying the women.

07:59.291 --> 08:01.592
We couldn't find their I.D's.

08:01.754 --> 08:03.663
I only know their aliases.

08:03.801 --> 08:05.680
Who would know
their real names?

08:05.720 --> 08:09.712
Ms Henry. She keeps
all that info in her computer.

08:09.783 --> 08:13.165
–Where is she?
–She was in there when I left.

08:13.398 --> 08:15.917
We're gonna need
that information.

08:16.118 --> 08:18.637
Her computer
is password protected.

08:18.837 --> 08:21.484
–Who else would know it?
–Our assistant, Julie.

08:21.524 --> 08:23.312
She was… also…

08:28.082 --> 08:30.536
All seven of them?

08:32.847 --> 08:35.496
–We only found six bodies.
–Six?

08:35.695 --> 08:38.727
There should be seven.

08:38.861 --> 08:41.989
We take a picture when they
arrive to document the abuse.

08:42.029 --> 08:46.084
–And she arrived?
–Today. A prostitute.
Said her pimp had beaten her.

08:46.124 --> 08:50.785
We usually don't take them in,
but she said if she went back on the street,
he'd kill her.

08:50.825 --> 08:53.246
You were right
to help her, then.

08:56.488 --> 08:59.421
I got two more women
coming in tomorrow.

08:59.559 --> 09:03.165
I can't send them back to their abusers.
Where am I supposed to take them?

09:03.205 --> 09:05.341
Maybe the city
has room for them.

09:05.381 --> 09:09.737
If the city had room, I wouldn't have
had to start my own shelter.

09:10.531 --> 09:12.865
Hold on.

09:13.027 --> 09:14.455
Yeah, that's her.

09:14.594 --> 09:17.817
Hey, Walt. This is our missing woman.
Get her face and name out to everyone.

09:17.857 --> 09:20.223
You got it.

09:20.384 --> 09:22.751
It's password protected.

09:22.785 --> 09:26.550
I-I know. That's why I called you.
You're the computer guy, right?

09:26.590 --> 09:29.230
Yeah, Police Information
Systems. P.I.S.

09:29.501 --> 09:32.817
–“Piss?”
–We don't call it that.

09:32.892 --> 09:36.723
I don't have any suspects until I get the real
names. Can you get 'em out?

09:36.763 --> 09:40.018
I'm not cleared to work on
non-departmental computers.

09:40.058 --> 09:42.479
It's an emergency.

09:45.112 --> 09:47.054
Oh.

09:49.718 --> 09:52.368
–Danny.
–Yes?

09:52.597 --> 09:57.167
Yassirah Al-Thani just filed
another complaint against you.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.715
She claims you made a threatening
phone call to her.

10:00.755 --> 10:02.958
I didn't threaten her.

10:03.122 --> 10:06.001
So you did
call her then? Why?

10:06.035 --> 10:09.128
I just told her I knew what she was doing,
and I told her to stop.

10:09.168 --> 10:12.930
Just please tell me you did not call her
from your house.

10:13.071 --> 10:16.134
There will be a record of it then.
What were you thinking?

10:16.174 --> 10:19.717
That bitch destroyed my car.
She called here saying that my mom died.

10:19.757 --> 10:22.925
–We can't prove any of that.
–Oh, please! Jesus!

10:23.052 --> 10:25.255
She is trying
to ruin my life!

10:25.386 --> 10:27.203
We just ducked a major lawsuit…

10:27.243 --> 10:30.241
and you have just given her
a valid claim for harassment.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.591
You're gonna make
a formal apology.

10:36.775 --> 10:38.531
How's it coming?

10:38.726 --> 10:40.449
It's complicated.

10:40.645 --> 10:42.587
What's going on?

10:42.725 --> 10:45.407
Our “PIS” guy's
incontinent.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.327
Mind if I take a look?

10:47.523 --> 10:49.246
No.

10:49.315 --> 10:53.753
Emma I.D'd our missing woman.
Dorea Pinchuk. Five priors for solicitation.

10:53.793 --> 10:56.345
–She's either a witness or a victim.
–Or an accomplice.

10:56.385 --> 10:58.265
Emma says her pimp
was beating her.

10:58.305 --> 11:00.631
That's our guy.
We'll find out who he is.

11:00.671 --> 11:04.022
No, I'll find him. If this guy's behind the
shelter slaughter, he won't go down easy.

11:04.062 --> 11:06.844
Thanks. We'll run down other leads.

11:07.037 --> 11:10.331
How are you doing
with I.D'ing the victims?

11:10.492 --> 11:13.395
–Your boy know what he's doing?
–Better than this PIS-poor pud.

11:13.435 --> 11:16.533
Her name is Dorea Pinchuk.
She's a pro.

11:16.666 --> 11:20.242
We think she was kidnapped from the shelter
this morning. Might still be alive.

11:20.282 --> 11:23.215
Don't recognize her.
Who decorated her face?

11:23.671 --> 11:27.499
Her pimp. I want him.
You find out who he is. Ask around.

11:27.638 --> 11:30.158
–See if anyone's spotted her.
–Okay.

11:31.349 --> 11:32.875
Vic, um…

11:33.109 --> 11:35.851
this is, uh… kind of
a big thing, isn't it?

11:35.891 --> 11:38.760
High profile.
A lot of press.

11:38.899 --> 11:42.476
–A lot of work.
–Help me find her.

11:42.706 --> 11:45.897
I'll make sure that it counts
as two of your C.I tips.

11:45.937 --> 11:50.092
Yeah. I was thinking…
more like a bonus.

11:50.286 --> 11:55.467
I'm, uh, trying to get
a decent place to live.

11:55.629 --> 11:58.247
Maybe show I can
take care of Brian.

11:58.413 --> 12:01.707
Find the pimp.
I'll see about your bonus.

12:03.819 --> 12:06.217
She didn't firewall
her backdoor.

12:06.251 --> 12:09.152
–Most people don't.
–I can route around her password…

12:09.192 --> 12:11.488
by changing the operations
post back to default.

12:11.528 --> 12:13.829
I— I tried that.

12:13.991 --> 12:18.113
There. What do you wanna know?

12:18.246 --> 12:22.106
Fantastic! I need the real names
of those women and kids.

12:22.245 --> 12:25.571
Along with a formal apology
from this department…

12:25.605 --> 12:29.499
Officer Sofer would like
to address your client personally.

12:30.913 --> 12:34.912
Mrs Al-Thani,
I apologize…

12:34.946 --> 12:38.642
for the phone call in which
I accused you of harassment.

12:38.943 --> 12:41.336
I had no proof
to support such a claim…

12:41.376 --> 12:44.940
and I am very sorry
if it caused you any undue stress.

12:45.500 --> 12:49.179
That's all good and well.
But we are still filing…

12:49.212 --> 12:52.498
a temporary restraining order
against Officer Sofer.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.386
–On what grounds?
–For what?

12:54.458 --> 12:56.945
Mrs Al-Thani
fears for her safety.

12:57.145 --> 13:00.592
You didn't shoot
and kill my husband?

13:00.759 --> 13:05.100
You'll be receiving our
paperwork by the end of the day.

13:21.681 --> 13:24.200
Stay put!

13:24.432 --> 13:28.524
–What's this about?
–It's about her! Do you know where she is?

13:28.783 --> 13:29.606
Dorea? I wish I knew.

13:29.646 --> 13:33.322
Get up here! You think
I'm screwing around, man?

13:33.517 --> 13:37.508
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man! I haven't
seen that bitch in a week, okay!

13:37.548 --> 13:40.994
–Who did that to her face?
–Her pimp! Oh, yeah, that's right. That's you.

13:41.034 --> 13:44.382
Man, I never put my hand
on any of my employees!

13:44.586 --> 13:49.866
That's some old school bullshit.
They can't go down if their lips are busted up.

14:02.404 --> 14:06.079
You call me
if you hear from Dorea…

14:06.274 --> 14:08.665
and I don't haul
the rest of your stable in.

14:08.705 --> 14:11.966
They can't go down
if they're locked up.

14:14.432 --> 14:16.536
No, they can't.

14:18.398 --> 14:20.821
Our pimp's a dead end.
You guys got anything?

14:20.861 --> 14:24.084
According to shelter records, three of our
victims checked in with a
total of five children.

14:24.124 --> 14:27.763
–Hold on. We only found four.
–I know. We're a kid short.

14:27.803 --> 14:30.195
–There's a seven-year-old boy missing.
–The missing hooker's son?

14:30.235 --> 14:34.000
No. His dad's the one guy we haven't been able
to locate. His mom's one of our bodies.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.680
–Looks like we got a suspect.
–If it is him, he left his
two-year-old daughter behind.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.854
A two year old's
harder to travel with.

14:39.894 --> 14:42.283
Maybe he just
doesn't like women.

14:44.565 --> 14:47.728
I'll call back.

14:47.925 --> 14:51.437
Who's our father of the year,
and why would he take a hooker with him?

14:51.477 --> 14:53.643
Name's Mike Holden.
He's a firefighter.

14:53.683 --> 14:57.513
He's got a thing for hookers.
Three priors for solicitation.

14:57.553 --> 14:59.408
Any connection to Dorea?

14:59.442 --> 15:03.666
She lied. The pimp never beat her.
He hasn't seen her in a week.

15:04.015 --> 15:08.635
How much do you wanna bet we find her
sliding down our fireman's pole?

15:15.563 --> 15:18.082
All right. Okay.
Settle down.

15:20.906 --> 15:22.815
Brass finally get wise?

15:22.857 --> 15:26.144
The new chief wants every captain in blues
and on the street once a month.

15:26.184 --> 15:28.191
A sort of keeping-it-real thing.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.951
Yeah. Keeping it real funny.

15:29.991 --> 15:34.809
I'd let you try out for the Strike Team,
but, you know, very competitive.

15:37.188 --> 15:39.609
–Ready?
–Sure.

15:39.779 --> 15:41.502
Let's roll.

15:43.106 --> 15:46.489
It was black and yellow.
Brand-new, with a black seat.

15:46.529 --> 15:50.167
–A Street jammer.
–One of those new sleek things
with the 18 speeds.

15:50.207 --> 15:53.076
Eighteen speeds.
Got it.

15:53.215 --> 15:55.542
–Where was it stolen from?
–Our yard.

15:55.582 --> 15:58.741
–Was it locked?
–Yes, but I told him not to leave it out.

15:58.781 --> 16:02.424
$300, and I just bought it
two days ago.

16:02.620 --> 16:05.303
We'll try to get it back.

16:09.113 --> 16:11.055
Emma, hi.

16:11.193 --> 16:13.569
These are the two women
I mentioned.

16:13.592 --> 16:15.920
–Hello.
–I couldn't believe your message.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.318
You really have a place
I can use temporarily?

16:18.358 --> 16:22.157
The city has a few apartments, houses
they use to stash witnesses during trials.

16:22.197 --> 16:24.557
I fudged the paperwork, got it
signed out for a few days.

16:24.597 --> 16:27.436
This isn't gonna get you
into trouble, is it?

16:27.476 --> 16:29.930
It's as white
as a lie gets.

16:30.099 --> 16:33.267
–I just hope it helps.
–You don't know how much.

16:34.897 --> 16:38.632
Here's the address, the keys.
Call me if you need anything.

16:38.672 --> 16:40.264
–Thank you.
–Sure.

16:40.463 --> 16:42.601
Emma…

16:42.734 --> 16:46.246
you're doing a good thing for these women.
–Well…

16:46.445 --> 16:49.379
someone did it for me once.

16:56.010 --> 16:58.693
You get my wedding
invitation?

16:58.890 --> 17:01.922
Yeah. Moving pretty fast.

17:02.056 --> 17:04.608
Yeah. Vanessa and I
are excited.

17:04.679 --> 17:08.045
–How long you been married?
–Eight years this June.

17:08.165 --> 17:10.816
Anything I should know
going in?

17:11.013 --> 17:13.434
Secrets.

17:13.604 --> 17:16.579
Don't have any.
Tell her everything.

17:16.613 --> 17:20.474
Because the one thing you think
she can't possibly know about…

17:20.515 --> 17:24.079
that's the one thing that
will come back to haunt you.

17:25.472 --> 17:28.221
Good to know.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.383
Hey, that stolen bike… black
and yellow Street jammer, right?

17:31.423 --> 17:34.422
Yeah.

17:41.403 --> 17:44.021
–Is that your bike?
–Yeah.

17:44.218 --> 17:47.479
It's kind of small
for you, isn't it?

17:47.641 --> 17:49.497
It rides, don't it?

17:49.530 --> 17:52.944
We got a report of a stolen bike.
Brand-new. It looks just like this one.

17:52.984 --> 17:57.294
–I didn't steal it!
–You may be young, but I will arrest you.
Give me the bike.

17:57.334 --> 18:00.700
–But I-I…
–Do you want me to take you in, book you?

18:04.052 --> 18:07.117
–No.
–Run home.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.843
Go on.

18:11.218 --> 18:13.726
Don't let me catch you
out here again.

18:19.375 --> 18:22.086
Two hours on the street.
Already cracked a case.

18:22.126 --> 18:26.762
Well, you know…
once you got it, you never lose it.

18:26.956 --> 18:30.370
Have pimp daddy
get these to his girls.

18:30.443 --> 18:34.086
Five grand? That's like
a hundred hand job reward.

18:34.410 --> 18:37.569
Vic, that guy was the pimp you were looking
for, right? That was good, right?

18:37.609 --> 18:40.383
Yeah, that was good. I'm
working on that bonus for you.

18:40.423 --> 18:43.684
In the meantime,
I got something else.

18:43.847 --> 18:45.821
We think
this is our shooter.

18:45.926 --> 18:48.319
Judging from his rap sheet,
he's a regular John.

18:48.359 --> 18:51.964
–Hand 'em out to the girls,
see if anybody knows him.
–Five thousand dollars?

18:52.004 --> 18:54.363
–That how much my bonus is going to be?
–No.

18:54.403 --> 18:57.722
That goes to whoever gives us
direct information that leads
to the arrest of the guy…

18:57.762 --> 18:59.998
or the safe return
of the kid.

19:01.601 --> 19:05.560
–Just get 'em out on the street.
–Yeah, okay.

19:07.679 --> 19:09.790
Want to tell me
why I'm here?

19:09.824 --> 19:12.213
–You know Mike Holden?
–Yeah. He's a friend.

19:12.253 --> 19:15.348
You're more than just friends. Weren't you
best man at each other's weddings?

19:15.388 --> 19:18.453
–Yeah.
–Bailed him out of trouble a few times?

19:18.587 --> 19:22.776
Arrest for soliciting prostitutes.
A drunk and disorderly.

19:22.938 --> 19:25.169
Each time, the charge
was dropped on a technicality.

19:25.209 --> 19:26.997
Officers make mistakes.

19:27.193 --> 19:29.520
And sometimes cops
help out their friends.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.591
–Is there anything wrong with that?
–Maybe not at Western division.

19:32.631 --> 19:36.459
–But here it's a different story.
–That's not what I hear.

19:38.741 --> 19:42.187
Six women were murdered
last night at a place…

19:42.388 --> 19:46.282
where their husbands shouldn't
have been able to find them.

19:48.113 --> 19:51.952
That's-That's Mike's wife Julie.
What… What happened?

19:51.986 --> 19:53.960
Oh, don't tell us
you didn't hear.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.950
Someone broke into a woman's shelter
and killed them. We think Mike did it.

20:00.110 --> 20:02.949
–No way.
–There were five children
staying at the shelter.

20:02.989 --> 20:05.377
Only Mike's son was taken.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.419
Mike wouldn't do that.
Mike loved Julie. He wouldn't kill her.

20:08.459 --> 20:10.498
He's violent enough
to beat her regularly, isn't he?

20:10.538 --> 20:12.546
She knew how to push
his buttons…

20:12.586 --> 20:15.585
but it was never as black and white
as she made it out to be.

20:15.625 --> 20:19.039
–Why am I here?
–I think you got the address of the shelter.

20:19.079 --> 20:21.952
It's secret to the public,
but a cop could get it.

20:21.992 --> 20:25.278
You told him where she was. Then he
sent his hooker girlfriend over there…

20:25.318 --> 20:28.546
to make sure, and then
he killed those women…

20:28.580 --> 20:31.808
and disappeared
with the hooker and his kid.

20:32.419 --> 20:36.346
Any idea where your
best man is now, Lou?

20:38.273 --> 20:42.527
If I knew, that would make me
an accomplice after the fact.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.955
No. We just want
to find Mike.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.766
I need, like, 20 minutes
to think about some things.

20:47.806 --> 20:50.140
We don't have 20 minutes.

20:50.301 --> 20:53.333
Then I can't say anything.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.479
Yo, Tecks got a hit.

21:10.679 --> 21:14.061
I talked to one of my girls.
Seems your fireman had a thing for Dorea.

21:14.101 --> 21:16.653
He started seeing her regularly
and then off the books.

21:16.693 --> 21:19.339
Started playing Jack and Jill
on my goddamn dime.

21:19.379 --> 21:22.826
–Anyone seen him?
–No. And the bitch won't return my pages.

21:22.866 --> 21:26.509
Oh, screw her.
You hear something, you call us.

21:28.401 --> 21:31.015
–I can't believe it.
–Sometimes we're good.

21:31.055 --> 21:33.095
Sometimes we're lucky.
Sometimes we're both.

21:33.135 --> 21:35.115
–Hey, this is not mine.
–What?

21:35.119 --> 21:39.492
This is not my bike. I scratched
my initials under the seat. See?

21:39.981 --> 21:43.689
–J.D. It's not there.
–You didn't tell us that.

21:43.883 --> 21:46.086
Well, can I keep it
anyways?

21:49.641 --> 21:51.812
I'm afraid not.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.679
Sorry.

21:57.510 --> 21:59.484
I just stole a kid's bike.

21:59.623 --> 22:01.345
Time's up.

22:01.542 --> 22:03.901
I hope you used it
as wisely as we did.

22:03.941 --> 22:06.334
Your bank says you withdrew
$400 today.

22:06.374 --> 22:10.268
While you were on duty.
You mind if we look in your wallet?

22:14.305 --> 22:17.054
Where's the cash?

22:17.216 --> 22:22.326
You got a call on your cell from a pay phone
10 minutes before you made this withdrawal.

22:22.366 --> 22:26.517
That money was for Mike, wasn't it?
You saw him after these murders.

22:26.557 --> 22:28.858
Look, I can't lose my job.

22:29.021 --> 22:31.156
–This isn't about your job.
–Yes, it is!

22:31.196 --> 22:33.617
It's about a child's life!

22:33.787 --> 22:37.483
You know how many of these
things end in murder/suicide?

22:37.594 --> 22:42.576
Look… I'm not gonna sit here and tell you
something and make me lose my job at 32.

22:42.616 --> 22:46.159
–I'm not even sniffing a pension yet.
–You knew Mike, Jr.

22:46.199 --> 22:49.330
You've been
to his birthday parties.

22:49.462 --> 22:52.690
Believe me, I want this
thing to end well. I do.

22:52.853 --> 22:56.168
But I got my own kid
to worry about.

23:01.618 --> 23:04.937
He's not gonna talk. He knows talking
helps us more than it helps him.

23:04.977 --> 23:07.336
He's not gonna break
unless we give him a reason to.

23:07.376 --> 23:09.255
The fact that he's a cop
helps us.

23:09.295 --> 23:12.550
He may not like being unemployed,
but he'll like prison even less.

23:12.590 --> 23:15.271
It could take us all day to make
a deal with him. The kid could be dead.

23:15.311 --> 23:18.308
Let's throw him a lifeline,
give him a free pass for the information.

23:18.348 --> 23:21.412
Just 'cause he's a cop doesn't
mean he gets a free pass. Not from me.

23:21.452 --> 23:24.353
–Dutch is right.
–I'm not talking to you.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.618
–I'm talking about saving a kid.
–Don't act like I'm not.

23:27.658 --> 23:30.272
–I vote he gets a pass.
–Who says your vote counts?

23:30.312 --> 23:34.015
I've been chasing down leads all over this
goddamn city. Better believe my vote counts.

23:34.055 --> 23:37.619
–This isn't your call. It's ours.
–I think he's right.

23:46.691 --> 23:49.529
How old did you say
your daughter was, Lou?

23:49.602 --> 23:52.601
–Three.
–I got two little girls of my own.

23:52.737 --> 23:54.940
–Family's good.
–And expensive.

23:55.104 --> 23:57.307
–No kidding.
–Yeah.

23:57.471 --> 24:01.502
But, see, I understand
what your problem is, Lou.

24:01.536 --> 24:04.277
You gotta keep your job,
gotta keep providing for them.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.197
I'm in a real tough spot here.

24:06.237 --> 24:09.432
Yeah. Except
Mike's still out there.

24:09.595 --> 24:11.896
We think he has the kid.

24:12.059 --> 24:14.898
We don't think he's
in the best frame of mind.

24:14.938 --> 24:18.928
For Christ's sake, you think I don't
realize that? I don't know what to do here.

24:18.968 --> 24:21.806
I mean, I'm… I'm
in an impossible position.

24:21.816 --> 24:24.366
Well, I think there's a way
we can both get what we need.

24:24.406 --> 24:26.315
How?

24:26.454 --> 24:28.493
Uh… you a smoker, Lou?

24:31.188 --> 24:33.996
–Are you jonesing for a smoke
about now, huh?
–Yeah.

24:34.036 --> 24:36.908
How's about you and me head down
to the motor pool, you grab that smoke…

24:36.948 --> 24:41.106
make an anonymous phone call,
tell me where Mike might've gone.

24:42.193 --> 24:44.134
I don't know.

24:47.855 --> 24:51.974
That's too risky. You find him, you can make
me an accomplice after the fact. No way.

24:52.014 --> 24:55.748
–Come on, Lou.
–Look, you know I want to help. I just can't.

24:55.788 --> 24:57.992
You son of a bitch.

24:58.251 --> 25:00.322
For the record, I have
no useful information.

25:00.362 --> 25:02.722
You know he's out there!
You know he's got the kid!

25:02.762 --> 25:07.712
–All you can think about
is saving your own ass!
–Whoa, what are you doing?

25:41.789 --> 25:44.788
Oh, look. It's the po-po
who stole my bike.

25:44.924 --> 25:47.284
There seems to have been
a misunderstanding.

25:47.324 --> 25:49.459
–I told you I didn't steal it.
–Yes, you did.

25:49.499 --> 25:51.698
–And you didn't believe me.
–Well, we had a report.

25:51.738 --> 25:53.745
–The description matched.
–Description?

25:53.785 --> 25:56.468
My parents said
that's racial profiling.

25:56.665 --> 25:58.863
No, look. That's
not what happened here.

25:58.903 --> 26:02.702
They said if I ever get profiled,
be polite, respect the officer…

26:02.742 --> 26:06.385
but, um…
get a badge number.

26:06.581 --> 26:09.036
–Look, here's your bike back.
–Is that a eight or a three?

26:09.076 --> 26:12.811
I'm sorry about the mix-up.
It's his first day on the
job. He's still learning.

26:12.851 --> 26:15.306
What do you say
we just forget about it?

26:15.346 --> 26:17.769
I'll make sure
it doesn't happen again.

26:17.809 --> 26:20.012
And I'll owe you one.

26:22.448 --> 26:25.894
All right. But, uh…
better not happen again.

26:33.164 --> 26:35.335
Thanks.

26:35.467 --> 26:38.084
Better not happen again.

26:43.656 --> 26:46.496
I hear Aceveda's putting
a new member on your team.

26:46.536 --> 26:49.695
No. He's jamming affirmative action
down our throats.

26:49.735 --> 26:51.458
Looking at any women?

26:51.654 --> 26:54.111
Yeah. We're bringing in
Batgirl and Charlie's Angels.

26:54.151 --> 26:59.167
Oh, I see. 'Cause someone like me could
never run with the real cops, right?

27:00.707 --> 27:05.627
No. I mean, you know, we're gonna
look at all viable candidates.

27:08.448 --> 27:10.304
–Asshole.
–What?

27:10.338 --> 27:13.303
Come on! I didn't know
you were being serious.

27:13.343 --> 27:16.092
Three years on Vice,
a year on Narcotics.

27:16.190 --> 27:18.550
–Any gang time?
–Just what I saw in Vice.

27:18.590 --> 27:21.237
A little undercover
when I first got my shield.

27:21.277 --> 27:23.700
–I'm a fast learner though.
–We're a tight team.

27:23.740 --> 27:25.619
Trust and brotherhood
keep us alive.

27:25.659 --> 27:27.986
Well, I'm looking
to be part of a team.

27:28.026 --> 27:30.197
I see that.

27:30.329 --> 27:33.272
Decorated marine.
You see any action?

27:33.306 --> 27:36.144
Short tour in Bosnia.
Marines saved my ass.

27:36.632 --> 27:39.024
I used to be a hell-raiser.
Needed the discipline.

27:39.064 --> 27:41.901
–You know how to follow the rules.
–Yes, sir.

27:41.941 --> 27:45.769
And I'm a guy who likes
busting people who break them.

27:48.148 --> 27:49.871
Good.

27:51.538 --> 27:54.121
–I see you got a wife and kid.
–My boy'll be four next month.

27:54.161 --> 27:56.168
Brave guy.

27:56.273 --> 27:59.112
Must've been a tough decision
to join my crew right now…

27:59.152 --> 28:02.086
especially with people
you love at home.

28:02.255 --> 28:05.701
Yeah. Uh…
what do you mean?

28:05.870 --> 28:07.593
Didn't Aceveda tell you?

28:07.789 --> 28:11.588
We pissed off a serious Mexican player.
The whole team's been greenlit.

28:11.628 --> 28:13.570
–Greenlit?
–Yeah.

28:13.707 --> 28:16.226
Hits out on all of us.

28:18.665 --> 28:22.560
What did you say to Villanueva?
He withdrew his application.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.803
That's too bad.
He had promise.

28:24.968 --> 28:28.126
–You scared him off.
–Better in here than out on the street.

28:28.166 --> 28:32.189
Look, the field is only gonna get thinner. The
choices don't get much better than Robbie.

28:32.229 --> 28:34.749
Maybe the next guy'll
feel right.

28:34.948 --> 28:38.299
Don't think these stall tactics are gonna work.
We're gonna hire a minority and soon.

28:38.339 --> 28:40.760
Yes, Officer.

28:49.823 --> 28:52.343
Carla here says that fireman
picked her up…

28:52.383 --> 28:55.286
with another girl
a couple of times lately, weekends.

28:55.326 --> 28:57.333
For a threesome?

28:57.469 --> 29:01.627
To baby-sit. She'd watch his kid
while he banged the other one.

29:01.755 --> 29:03.667
Sometimes
the other way around.

29:03.707 --> 29:06.488
Jesus. Why isn't she
telling me this?

29:06.682 --> 29:12.147
She, uh… She just
don't trust cops.

29:12.344 --> 29:15.055
Or maybe you just forgot
to tell her about the reward.

29:15.095 --> 29:17.014
Whatever.

29:17.048 --> 29:19.789
–He come around lately?
–A couple of weeks ago.

29:19.829 --> 29:21.742
Okay. Well, he's got
the kid back.

29:21.782 --> 29:25.228
You tell her to call me if he comes around
looking to play nasty nanny.

29:25.268 --> 29:27.446
–Don't worry. I'll call.
–Connie.

29:27.475 --> 29:30.769
Thanks for your help.

29:36.144 --> 29:38.388
We know if our hooker's got a car?

29:38.543 --> 29:40.646
–None that's registered.
–That means he's driving his own.

29:40.686 --> 29:43.429
Or he stole one. Get me
a list of every car stolen…

29:43.469 --> 29:45.637
within a five-mile radius
of the shelter last night.

29:45.677 --> 29:47.978
Yes, ma'am.

29:52.907 --> 29:56.005
Maybe you, uh, should go in,
try your way.

29:56.138 --> 30:00.416
If Lou knows we've got nothing on him,
what am I gonna use for leverage?

30:00.456 --> 30:02.659
Yeah. I don't know.

30:05.223 --> 30:09.051
Well, I'll try, but
it's a waste of time now.

30:13.188 --> 30:15.675
I checked the arrest reports.

30:15.843 --> 30:18.426
You guys have been on the street
seven hours, haven't made a single collar.

30:18.466 --> 30:20.188
We're working a robbery.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.776
–How's that going?
–It's progressing.

30:22.816 --> 30:27.543
–From the donut shop,
to the sports bar, to the strip club.
–Absolutely not.

30:27.583 --> 30:30.198
–Cute.
–The captain does not like excuses.

30:30.238 --> 30:32.539
He just likes results.

30:35.100 --> 30:38.387
You want to get the paperwork
on this bicycle thing, or should I?

30:38.427 --> 30:40.696
I'll do it tomorrow.

30:40.891 --> 30:43.861
We need to complete
our reports the same day.

30:43.929 --> 30:46.001
I'll let myself slide.

30:46.137 --> 30:48.209
Yeah?

30:48.344 --> 30:51.791
–The guys are here putting in the alarm.
–Oh, good.

30:51.959 --> 30:54.288
Vic, this isn't some
simple keypad by the door.

30:54.328 --> 30:59.948
They're wiring the windows, putting in timed
lights outside, setting up motion detectors.

30:59.988 --> 31:02.188
Is there something
that I need to know?

31:02.228 --> 31:05.000
Know that you have
nothing to worry about.

31:05.042 --> 31:07.049
It just seems a bit much.

31:07.186 --> 31:09.705
It seems a little complicated at first,
but you'll get used to it.

31:09.745 --> 31:12.526
–Okay.
–Okay.

31:17.551 --> 31:19.910
Followed Corrine all day.
No problems.

31:19.950 --> 31:21.732
–Same with the kids.
–Good.

31:21.869 --> 31:24.292
–They're beautiful children.
–Yeah. Thanks.

31:24.332 --> 31:28.579
Listen. This protection… I can cut you a deal,
but it's still gonna cost a bundle.

31:28.619 --> 31:31.401
–I know.
–I'd welcome the windfall.

31:31.594 --> 31:34.376
But paying to watch
your kids at recess?

31:34.409 --> 31:38.208
Let me just stick a couple of guys on the house
at night. That plus the alarm.

31:38.248 --> 31:40.607
I don't want to take
any chances right now. Stay on them.

31:40.647 --> 31:43.809
Sure. Okay, Vic.
Good news is you're right.

31:44.133 --> 31:48.093
She's not seeing anyone.
At least not yet.

31:48.261 --> 31:51.693
You're a lucky man.
I'd leave the house to get milk…

31:53.890 --> 31:54.747
my ex would be balling some other guy
before I got to the 7-11.

31:54.787 --> 31:56.761
I gotta take this.

31:56.898 --> 31:59.585
Yeah, sure.
I'll talk to you later.

31:59.619 --> 32:01.373
–Yeah.
–Hey, it's me.

32:01.505 --> 32:05.015
–Hey, Connie, where are you?
–I'm in an apartment. I'm with the kid.

32:05.055 --> 32:09.815
–What are you doing?
–I was with Carla when Dorea
came looking for a baby-sitter.

32:09.855 --> 32:12.627
–I figured it was for him.
–Where are you?

32:12.732 --> 32:17.041
1530 Los Prisa, number 24,
right next to the 101 on-ramp.

32:17.211 --> 32:19.699
This'll get me the five grand,
right, Vic?

32:19.739 --> 32:22.577
Get the kid
and get out of there right now!

32:22.681 --> 32:26.416
I can't. I'm in the bedroom.
I gotta go past them to get to the door.

32:26.456 --> 32:29.684
Is there a window
or a fire escape?

32:29.846 --> 32:32.180
–Who are you talking to?
–Connie!

32:32.342 --> 32:34.610
Setting up my next date.

32:34.773 --> 32:37.261
You're still mine
for another 20 minutes.

32:37.301 --> 32:38.958
Come join us.

32:40.723 --> 32:42.835
Shouldn't someone
stay with him?

32:42.899 --> 32:45.265
No. He sleeps
through anything.

33:12.873 --> 33:15.880
Okay. Let's set up
a containment.

33:15.913 --> 33:19.279
Ronnie, you take the rear.
Lem, you take starboard.

33:19.494 --> 33:21.440
–You take port.
–Where are you going?

33:21.480 --> 33:24.860
Through the front door, as soon
as the department snipers get here.

33:24.900 --> 33:27.136
Shit!

33:27.300 --> 33:29.544
Ah, we're supposed to be
non-code.

33:29.571 --> 33:32.145
Nobody told the ambulances.
Goddamn it!

33:43.071 --> 33:45.820
–You called the cops.
–No. I swear!

33:45.854 --> 33:49.397
–Drop the gun, Mike! Put the gun down, Mike!
–Call 'em off!

33:49.437 --> 33:54.100
Take that gun away from her!
Otherwise, you might as well be
putting a bullet into your head!

33:54.140 --> 33:56.506
–I want 'em gone!
–Okay.

33:56.667 --> 34:00.943
Back off!
Everybody, back off!

34:04.088 --> 34:06.771
Mike, I'm coming in to talk.

34:06.935 --> 34:09.870
–I don't need to talk!
–Two hostages are better than one!

34:09.909 --> 34:12.047
Gun stays outside!

34:13.621 --> 34:17.646
Throw down piece two! Come on!
You think I don't know cops?

34:20.722 --> 34:23.918
Okay, Dorea, get the door.

34:28.656 --> 34:30.989
Come on!

34:31.150 --> 34:33.900
Shut the door! Lock it!

34:34.094 --> 34:35.817
Lock it!

34:37.933 --> 34:40.012
Shut the blinds!

34:40.045 --> 34:42.913
Goddamn snipers, right?
Shut the blinds!

34:47.402 --> 34:49.157
You okay?

34:49.353 --> 34:51.261
You need a plan.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.775
I'm the man
that can make it happen.

34:53.831 --> 34:57.470
Cut the negotiator 101 crap! You're gonna do
what I tell you, or I'll kill you both!

34:57.510 --> 35:00.062
Fine. Take me.
Let the girl and the kid go.

35:00.102 --> 35:03.138
I already have what I want!
Call your buddies!

35:03.173 --> 35:06.268
Tell 'em you're in here if they're thinking
of using gas or knocking down the door!

35:06.308 --> 35:08.410
It's not gonna matter
to them that I'm in here.

35:08.450 --> 35:11.258
They're not gonna do the risky
stuff with one of their own!

35:11.298 --> 35:13.599
–Do it! Do it!
–Okay. Okay.

35:20.543 --> 35:22.422
–What's going on?
–Mackey's inside.

35:22.462 --> 35:26.073
So… why don't you
let him go? The kid.

35:26.269 --> 35:29.397
–He's been through enough.
–I didn't go through all this
just to lose him again.

35:29.437 --> 35:31.731
–He's mine.
–He's your son. He's not your property.

35:31.771 --> 35:33.874
You don't know a goddamn
thing about it!

35:33.914 --> 35:36.947
The hell I don't!
I got a boy. I had a boy.

35:37.081 --> 35:38.869
My wife has him now.

35:39.064 --> 35:42.871
She left me.
Made me leave.

35:42.905 --> 35:45.611
Then she took my son
and my little girls.

35:49.429 --> 35:52.494
–They always take everything.
–Everything except advice.

35:52.534 --> 35:55.883
That's why I like whores.
You know what you're buying.

35:55.923 --> 35:58.251
–We never had a problem, did we, baby?
–No, baby.

35:58.291 --> 36:01.966
It's not even like I feel alone.
I just feel abandoned.

36:02.289 --> 36:04.840
–Pissed off?
–Yeah. Hell, yeah, pissed off.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.661
I tried with Julie.

36:07.855 --> 36:10.091
I didn't want… I didn't…

36:10.255 --> 36:15.269
It's all right. I've had the same thoughts
go through my mind that you've had.

36:15.309 --> 36:18.374
You're not the only guy
who's been used.

36:18.507 --> 36:22.662
Most of all, I…
I just miss my kids.

36:24.265 --> 36:28.574
I… I can feel myself becoming
a stranger to 'em, you know?

36:37.541 --> 36:40.093
–You're so full of shit.
–No.

36:40.261 --> 36:43.804
You're gonna sit there and pretend
to understand me, what I'm going through?

36:43.844 --> 36:47.226
–I'm telling you the truth.
–You think I'm gonna believe
a bullshit story like that?

36:47.266 --> 36:50.170
–Hey, calm down!
–What, it's gonna make me
associate with you?

36:50.210 --> 36:52.472
–Calm down!
–I'm gonna give you this gun?

36:52.512 --> 36:55.703
You think I'm some kind of idiot
that you don't have to take seriously?

36:55.743 --> 36:58.199
–Of course I do.
–This is how serious I am!

36:58.239 --> 37:01.554
Oh, fuck!

37:05.852 --> 37:09.779
–Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!
–No!

37:09.915 --> 37:12.914
Suspect is wearing
a gray T-shirt.

37:13.049 --> 37:16.481
–She's dying.
–You're gonna be dead too if you move.

37:17.593 --> 37:20.309
–You didn't need to do that.
–Shut up.

37:20.568 --> 37:23.665
Jesus! What the hell
is the matter with you?

37:23.766 --> 37:26.142
–Shut up!
–You stupid piece of shit!

37:26.293 --> 37:28.081
Dad, what's wrong?

37:28.277 --> 37:30.862
Mikey, it's all right.
Stay in there, okay? Shut up.

37:30.902 --> 37:33.643
–Dad?
–Shut up. I can't think when you're talking.

37:33.683 --> 37:36.587
–Dad?
–It's okay. It's okay. Just go inside.

37:57.611 --> 37:59.944
Oh, Christ!

38:14.885 --> 38:18.233
Oh, Vic, I'm…

38:28.097 --> 38:30.202
–Officer Sofer.
–Yeah?

38:30.336 --> 38:32.790
Detectives Branning
and Simpkins.

38:32.959 --> 38:35.097
–I.A.D.
–Yes?

38:35.230 --> 38:37.401
We need to search
your vehicle.

38:37.534 --> 38:39.705
Why?

38:39.837 --> 38:45.249
We got an anonymous call. Someone claims
you're dealing marijuana out of your car.

38:45.659 --> 38:50.164
Okay, look. I was involved
in an on-duty shooting last month.

38:50.618 --> 38:52.561
That guy's wife
has it out for me.

38:52.601 --> 38:54.608
This is another bullshit
prank of hers.

38:54.648 --> 38:58.001
Either way, new regulations say
we have to investigate every complaint.

38:58.041 --> 39:01.138
No matter how bogus.
Where's your car?

39:13.522 --> 39:16.041
Got something.

39:16.242 --> 39:18.477
Wait a minute.
That's not mine.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.803
I told you, this Arab woman.
She wants my job!

39:22.000 --> 39:25.318
She's the one that vandalized my car.
She must've put the pot in at the same time.

39:25.358 --> 39:29.125
We'll look into that, but we're also
gonna have some questions.

39:29.165 --> 39:33.187
What sort of questions? Dust the bag for
fingerprints. You're not gonna find mine.

39:33.227 --> 39:35.299
Let's talk inside.

39:36.554 --> 39:40.993
Oh, please! What do you think I am,
some big-time drug dealer?

39:41.513 --> 39:45.376
I just happen to keep my pot…
all four ounces of it… in an unlocked car…

39:45.416 --> 39:47.870
in the middle
of a police station?

39:49.734 --> 39:52.002
It's a setup.

39:54.469 --> 39:57.697
Mike's been shot.
He's dead.

39:57.860 --> 40:00.063
Oh, Jesus!

40:00.163 --> 40:04.123
He also managed to take
another woman's life before he died.

40:05.537 --> 40:10.457
Eight people dead.
But you saved your job.

40:10.591 --> 40:14.617
–Listen. I never wanted any of this to happen.
–Good for you.

40:14.685 --> 40:16.863
Now get the hell
out of my sight.

40:30.873 --> 40:33.431
Okay, your system's
running fine.

40:33.465 --> 40:36.435
Well, it should.
They told me it cost $2·000.

40:36.727 --> 40:40.620
I got a deal from a guy I know.
Sort of a barter thing.

40:45.236 --> 40:47.341
What's wrong?

40:47.475 --> 40:50.409
–What?
–Did something happen?

40:50.546 --> 40:52.268
It's just work.

40:52.465 --> 40:55.178
Just make sure you
turn it on when I leave.

40:55.218 --> 40:58.120
I will. Are you…
Are you sure you're all right?

40:58.160 --> 41:00.428
Yeah.

41:00.559 --> 41:03.526
I'll see you and the kids
tomorrow for dinner.

41:03.566 --> 41:05.256
Okay.

41:17.833 --> 41:20.134
Here you go.

41:21.512 --> 41:23.583
–They found it, Mama.
–Whoa.

41:23.719 --> 41:26.206
Put this on, little man.
State law.

41:26.374 --> 41:30.268
Okay. Go, go!

41:30.405 --> 41:32.444
Go! Thank you.

41:32.580 --> 41:34.751
We're here to serve.

41:34.884 --> 41:37.378
$300 for a bike!

41:37.412 --> 41:40.448
Lucky this uniform thing
is only once a month.

41:40.865 --> 41:43.417
Any more crying kids,
I'd be broke.

41:57.820 --> 42:00.403
