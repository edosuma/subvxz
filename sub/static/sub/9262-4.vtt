enough to get it back,

he shoots his way

He's pretty freaked out.

waited for the right time,

I'd never get
these street hours done.

an exception in your case?

I didn't ask him to.

of your condition.

He also knows that it doesn't
affect my job performance.

Well,

10:19.184 --> 10:20.651

Uh, we need a parent present
to take kid's statement.

10:23.421 --> 10:24.388
Father's not in picture,

10:24.389 --> 10:26.591

by the book.

I asked Julien
for a status report.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.442
Amando Rios sounds
Mexican to my ears.

11:18.443 --> 11:20.344
Rios is one of the names
that dropped.

turning into something.

You track down Rezian?

of his mob lieutenants.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.721
Matavian and Bozian.

11:30.722 --> 11:33.124
He shed light
on any Mexican trouble?

11:33.125 --> 11:34.258
He's as in the dark as we are.

They can't strike back
without a target.

11:36.227 --> 11:37.394
Ask Olivia.

11:37.395 --> 11:38.462
Maybe the feds can point us

11:38.463 --> 11:40.530
in Rios' direction.
Already on it.

you get through the paperwork

That boy broke in.

11:59.984 --> 12:02.819
I know that Lloyd
was only defending himself.

12:02.820 --> 12:04.855
He shouldn't be
in any kind of trouble.

We need your son
to tell us what happened.

When did you realize
the intruder was Luis?

12:16.968 --> 12:19.103
Not until after.

12:19.104 --> 12:22.840
When I heard somebody come in,
I went to my mom's room.

12:22.841 --> 12:24.241
BILLINGS:
To get the revolver?

12:24.242 --> 12:25.543
I figured I could hide

12:25.544 --> 12:27.845

took what they wanted.

12:27.846 --> 12:29.813
But he just--
He kept...

12:29.814 --> 12:32.416

MRS. DENTON: Neighborhood's all we
could afford since Lloyd's dad left,

12:36.955 --> 12:39.056
so I got that gun
for protection.

12:39.057 --> 12:40.658
Ever been fired before now?

12:40.659 --> 12:42.493
MRS. DENTON:
Only at the range.

12:42.494 --> 12:43.961
I wanted Lloyd to understand

12:43.962 --> 12:45.763
that a gun
is a big responsibility

12:45.764 --> 12:48.099

took safety classes.

Mm.

Do you and Luis
know each other well?

I don't even think
he knew my name.

12:53.872 --> 12:58.141
I mean, we don't hang out
with the same people.

I try to stay away.

He's been through
so much already.

19:26.497 --> 19:28.098
Must be hard,

19:35.239 --> 19:36.439
How's he doing, grade-wise?

19:36.440 --> 19:39.042
Honestly, his teachers say
he won't apply himself.

19:39.043 --> 19:42.412
He won't do his homework
but then he aces his tests.

19:42.413 --> 19:44.248
But he averages out to a C.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.016
It's common for kids
with high IQ's.

19:46.017 --> 19:48.752
Lloyd said he was doing his
homework when Luis broke in.

19:48.753 --> 19:52.456
Yeah, I guess he finally
started listening to me.

if I stayed in touch?

19:54.225 --> 19:57.027

all the help he needs.

Yes, of course.

20:00.931 --> 20:02.600
Okay.

20:04.135 --> 20:05.969

about the box,

to prep a shootout.

20:13.745 --> 20:15.445

20:24.755 --> 20:26.089
I gotta stay
as neutral as possible.

20:51.582 --> 20:53.050
Picking up Rios
means no meeting.

what Rezian's playing.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.522
Well, there aren't
a lot of white kids.

26:32.523 --> 26:33.823
Not that that matters,

26:33.824 --> 26:36.759

and gang activities,

26:36.760 --> 26:41.364

just find himself a girlfriend.

in his head that

that the Armenians
have the blackmail box.

27:38.122 --> 27:41.024
We need him to continue
thinking that. That's all.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.293
It's our best shot

27:44.294 --> 27:47.296
at getting Pezuela
to incriminate himself.

the Armenian genocide,

27:54.471 --> 27:57.807
their supporters have proposed
a commemorating memorial.

have been denied every year

to erect some monument

40:41.238 --> 40:42.338
Yeah.

40:43.774 --> 40:46.241
We need to find this box.

40:46.242 --> 40:47.209
Yeah, well, good luck.

40:47.210 --> 40:48.911
I need your help
to do it.

40:48.912 --> 40:51.146
It's your final favor.

40:51.147 --> 40:53.048
Then you
and your friend are free

40:53.049 --> 40:54.783
from my organization's
punishment.

40:56.753 --> 40:58.988
Well, all right, then.

[KNOCKS]

41:01.791 --> 41:03.059
Hey, you got a sec?

41:03.060 --> 41:06.495
Sure. Two, even.

41:06.496 --> 41:08.064
I just need you to sign this.

41:08.065 --> 41:10.032
It's about Lee.
My lawyer drew it up.

41:10.033 --> 41:11.600
Your lawyer?

41:11.601 --> 41:13.836
Since when do we talk
through a mouthpiece?

41:16.606 --> 41:19.374
You wanna tell me
what this shit means?

41:19.375 --> 41:21.777
That you waive
your parental rights to my son.

41:21.778 --> 41:23.245
We've talked
about this before.

41:23.246 --> 41:24.547
It's just in writing this time.

41:24.548 --> 41:25.714
I see that.

41:25.715 --> 41:27.616
I thought we were okay.

41:27.617 --> 41:29.952
We are.

41:29.953 --> 41:32.120
Then why is it
in writing this time?

41:32.121 --> 41:35.223
So that there's no confusion
down the road.

41:40.630 --> 41:42.397
Just get it
back to me, okay?

41:57.147 --> 41:59.581
[GROANS]

41:59.582 --> 42:02.151
You forget to hit me up
for a campaign contribution?

42:02.152 --> 42:03.685
That fed in the clubhouse.

42:03.686 --> 42:06.955
How close is she?
To the truth?

42:06.956 --> 42:09.525
Agent Murray's looking
to take down the cartel.

42:09.526 --> 42:11.060
Connecting Pezuela to them

42:11.061 --> 42:12.695
is just a win-win
for all of us.

42:12.696 --> 42:15.130
Yeah, I thought
I'd seen her name somewhere.

42:15.131 --> 42:16.365
Tonight, I confirmed it.

42:22.438 --> 42:24.073
She's in the blackmail box?

42:24.074 --> 42:27.042
Which means the face of your
plan's crucial next step

42:27.043 --> 42:28.911
is on the hook to Pezuela.

42:31.748 --> 42:35.784
ACEVEDA:
How much have you told her?

42:35.785 --> 42:37.553
Hey. He's got her
in his pocket.

42:37.554 --> 42:40.222
How much have you told her?

42:43.092 --> 42:46.194
Enough to blow it
with Pezuela.

42:46.195 --> 42:47.763
Get us both killed.
