00:49.221 --> 00:52.452
All I ever wanted
was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.

00:53.225 --> 00:56.422
It all began in the summer of 1957,
before the start of second grade.

00:56.595 --> 00:58.290
- Here we are.
- Ha, ha.

00:58.564 --> 01:00.555
- What do you guys think?
- I like this place.

01:00.732 --> 01:03.064
- It's cool.
- Uh, what color is my room?

01:03.235 --> 01:04.896
Just you wait.

01:05.069 --> 01:07.630
- Let's see what's inside.
- Hey, come on, buddy Bryce.

01:07.806 --> 01:10.434
Why don't, uh, you and I
go help unload the van...

01:10.609 --> 01:14.204
...and the womenfolk here
can get in the kitchen and start setting up.

01:14.379 --> 01:15.846
Okay, Dad.

01:16.014 --> 01:18.244
For me, it was the beginning
of what would be...

01:18.417 --> 01:22.786
...more than half a decade of
strategic avoidance and social discomfort.

01:24.022 --> 01:26.752
- Hi, I'm Juli Baker.
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

01:26.925 --> 01:28.119
Don't you want some help?

01:28.293 --> 01:30.420
No. There's some
valuable things in there.

01:30.596 --> 01:33.394
- How about this one?
- No, no, no.

01:33.632 --> 01:36.362
Run home. Your mother's
probably wondering where you are.

01:36.535 --> 01:39.231
Oh, no, my mom knows where I am.
She said it's fine.

01:39.404 --> 01:42.134
It didn't take long to realize
this girl could not take a hint.

01:42.307 --> 01:44.798
- It's crowded in here with three people.
- I don't mind.

01:44.977 --> 01:47.775
- Of any kind.
- You wanna push this one together?

01:49.381 --> 01:52.111
Bryce, isn't it time for you
to go help your mother?

01:52.751 --> 01:54.116
Huh?

01:55.153 --> 01:56.552
Oh, yeah.

01:57.589 --> 01:59.955
I mean, nothing would stop her.

02:00.125 --> 02:03.959
I was about to tell her to get lost
when the weirdest thing happened.

02:08.633 --> 02:10.101
I couldn't believe it.

02:10.268 --> 02:14.170
There I was holding hands
with this strange girl.

02:14.339 --> 02:16.773
- How did I get into this mess?
- Well, hello.

02:18.110 --> 02:20.510
- I see you've met my son.
- Uh-huh.

02:20.679 --> 02:26.049
Finally, I did the only manly
thing available when you're 7 years old.

02:32.057 --> 02:35.322
However, my troubles were far from over.

02:35.694 --> 02:38.128
The minute I walked
into Miss Yelson's classroom...

02:38.296 --> 02:40.787
Bryce? You're here.

02:42.834 --> 02:44.927
School would not be a sanctuary.

02:46.905 --> 02:49.271
Hey, Bryce, where's your girlfriend?

02:49.441 --> 02:51.432
I was branded for life.

02:51.710 --> 02:55.874
Hey, Bryce,
why don't you ask her to marry you?

02:56.181 --> 02:59.446
Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree

02:59.618 --> 03:02.849
K-l-S-S-l-N-G

03:03.021 --> 03:05.012
My first year in town was a disaster.

03:05.190 --> 03:06.214
Look at them.

03:06.391 --> 03:08.382
And the next three weren't much better.

03:08.560 --> 03:11.654
But finally, in the sixth grade,
I took action.

03:11.830 --> 03:13.798
I hatched the plan.

03:14.066 --> 03:15.499
Sherry.

03:16.535 --> 03:17.832
Sherry, wait up.

03:18.804 --> 03:19.828
Hi, Bryce. Heh.

03:20.272 --> 03:21.603
I asked out Sherry Stalls.

03:21.773 --> 03:23.638
I was wondering if you wanted to go...

03:23.809 --> 03:26.243
To full appreciate
the brilliance of this plan...

03:26.411 --> 03:29.346
...you have to understand
that Juli hated Sherry Stalls...

03:29.848 --> 03:31.372
...though I never understood why.

03:31.550 --> 03:34.815
Sherry was nice, friendly
and she had a lot of hair.

03:35.020 --> 03:38.387
At first, my mother wouldn't let me
get my ears pierced, but I begged...

03:38.557 --> 03:40.684
The idea was that Sherry
would eat with me...

03:40.859 --> 03:44.818
...maybe we'd walk around together,
and hopefully Juli would lose interest.

03:44.996 --> 03:47.055
But I still can't get the hoops till I'm 16.

03:47.232 --> 03:48.392
Oh, that's a shame.

03:48.567 --> 03:52.697
So Melanie wanted to get her ears pierced,
but of course her mother said no.

03:52.871 --> 03:57.001
So she threw a fit and smashed
her Johnny Mathis Greatest Hits album...

03:58.910 --> 04:02.539
...and she got grounded, so now she can't
come to my pajama sleepover party.

04:02.714 --> 04:05.376
Things were unfolding quite nicely.

04:05.650 --> 04:07.641
What are you doing
for your science project?

04:07.819 --> 04:11.619
That is, until my supposed
best friend, Garrett Einbinder...

04:11.790 --> 04:13.655
...took an interest in Sherry himself.

04:13.825 --> 04:17.659
I was thinking of showing how split ends
react with different hair conditioners.

04:17.829 --> 04:18.988
That's fascinating.

04:19.164 --> 04:21.997
Loyalty gave way to desire
and Garrett, the turncoat...

04:22.167 --> 04:23.691
...told Sherry what I was up to.

04:24.035 --> 04:25.229
Jerk.

04:25.403 --> 04:27.200
She didn't take it well.

04:27.572 --> 04:32.168
Word got back to Juli, and pretty soon
she started up with the goo-goo eyes again.

04:32.344 --> 04:34.141
Only this time it was worse.

04:34.312 --> 04:36.940
She started sniffing me.

04:37.115 --> 04:39.481
That's right, sniffing me.

04:39.651 --> 04:41.209
What was that all about?

04:41.386 --> 04:44.116
My only consolation
was that next year would be different.

04:44.289 --> 04:46.382
Junior high, bigger school.

04:46.558 --> 04:50.995
Maybe we'd be in different classes
and it would finally, finally be over.

04:52.464 --> 04:55.991
The first day I met Bryce Loski, I flipped.

04:56.701 --> 05:00.467
It was those eyes,
something in those dazzling eyes.

05:00.639 --> 05:02.402
You wanna push this one together?

05:03.141 --> 05:05.439
His family had just moved
into the neighborhood...

05:05.610 --> 05:07.237
...and I'd gone over to help them.

05:07.412 --> 05:11.610
I'd been in the van all of two minutes
when his dad sent him off to help his mom.

05:11.783 --> 05:13.717
I could see he didn't wanna go.

05:13.885 --> 05:18.447
So I chased after him to see if we could
play a little before he got trapped inside.

05:20.225 --> 05:22.420
The next thing I know,
he's holding my hand...

05:22.594 --> 05:24.926
...and looking right into my eyes.

05:25.597 --> 05:26.962
My heart stopped.

05:27.132 --> 05:28.622
Was this it?

05:28.800 --> 05:31.360
Would this be my first kiss?

05:31.536 --> 05:34.369
- But then his mother came out.
- Well, hello.

05:34.539 --> 05:38.066
And he was so embarrassed,
his cheeks turned completely red.

05:39.344 --> 05:42.711
I went to bed that night thinking
of the kiss that might have been.

05:42.881 --> 05:47.716
I mean, it was clear he had feelings for me,
but he was just too shy to show them.

05:47.886 --> 05:50.150
My mother said boys were like that.

05:50.755 --> 05:54.088
- So I decided to help him out.
- Bryce? You're here.

05:56.061 --> 05:59.155
I would give him plenty
of opportunity to get over his shyness.

05:59.397 --> 06:02.696
By the sixth grade,
I'd learned to control myself.

06:02.868 --> 06:05.098
Then Sherry Stalls entered the picture.

06:06.171 --> 06:09.971
Sherry Stalls was nothing but a whiny,
gossipy, backstabbing flirt.

06:10.275 --> 06:12.072
All hair and no substance.

06:12.244 --> 06:13.336
And there she was...

06:13.511 --> 06:16.503
...holding hands with Bryce. My Bryce.

06:16.681 --> 06:19.206
The one who was walking around
with my first kiss.

06:19.384 --> 06:22.512
My solution was to ignore her.
I knew a boy of Bryce's caliber...

06:22.687 --> 06:26.179
...would eventually see through
a shallow conniver like Sherry Stalls.

06:26.358 --> 06:29.452
It took all of a week.
They broke up at recess.

06:30.862 --> 06:32.989
She didn't take it well.

06:33.999 --> 06:37.662
Now that Bryce was out of Sherry's
evil clutches, he started being nicer to me.

06:37.836 --> 06:40.464
- Hi, Juli.
- Hi, Bryce.

06:40.705 --> 06:43.333
He was so shy and so cute...

06:43.508 --> 06:46.033
...and his hair,
it smelled like watermelon.

06:46.211 --> 06:48.008
I couldn't get enough of it.

06:48.179 --> 06:50.875
I spent the whole year
secretly sniffing watermelon...

06:51.049 --> 06:54.348
...and wondering
if I was ever going to get my kiss.

06:57.522 --> 06:59.615
Seventh grade brought changes, all right.

06:59.791 --> 07:01.884
But the biggest one
didn't happen at school.

07:02.060 --> 07:03.823
It happened at home.

07:04.029 --> 07:06.691
My grandfather came to live with us.

07:14.105 --> 07:17.131
Mom said he stared like that
because he missed Grandma.

07:17.309 --> 07:20.107
That was not something Grandpa
would ever talk about with me.

07:21.279 --> 07:25.340
As a matter of fact, he never talked
about much of anything with me.

07:25.784 --> 07:28.617
That is, until Juli appeared
in the local newspaper.

07:28.787 --> 07:31.722
- Oh, Bryce. May I speak with you?
- What?

07:32.257 --> 07:33.281
Have a seat, son.

07:38.430 --> 07:40.193
Tell me about your friend Juli Baker.

07:41.066 --> 07:43.398
Juli. She's not exactly my friend.

07:43.568 --> 07:45.593
Oh. Why's that?

07:46.738 --> 07:48.035
Why do you wanna know?

07:49.708 --> 07:52.609
Now, Juli Baker did not
wind up in The Mayfield Times...

07:52.777 --> 07:54.642
...for being an eighth-grade Einstein.

07:54.813 --> 07:59.750
No, she got front-page coverage because
she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree.

08:00.418 --> 08:03.444
Juli Baker and that stupid sycamore tree.

08:03.621 --> 08:07.057
She always thought it was God's gift
to our little corner of the universe.

08:07.225 --> 08:10.126
Hey, Bryce. Wanna come climb the tree
with me and my brothers?

08:10.695 --> 08:12.287
No, thanks.

08:12.464 --> 08:15.262
Bryce. Come up here. It's fun.

08:15.433 --> 08:18.061
- You can see everything.
- I can't.

08:18.236 --> 08:23.299
My dad needs me to help him fix...

08:24.442 --> 08:25.966
...a thing.

08:26.511 --> 08:27.603
That's all I needed.

08:27.779 --> 08:30.043
Climb up a tree with Juli Baker.

08:30.215 --> 08:32.649
I'd be dragged right back
into the second grade.

08:32.817 --> 08:35.047
Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree.

08:35.220 --> 08:38.313
Why don't you just make me eat lima beans
for the rest of my life.

08:39.256 --> 08:41.087
It's three blocks away.

08:42.861 --> 08:43.986
Two blocks.

08:47.799 --> 08:49.289
One block away.

08:49.467 --> 08:52.459
- Like that's valuable information.
- I hate it when she does that.

08:52.637 --> 08:55.629
I like to think there's at least a chance
the bus won't show.

08:57.709 --> 09:01.110
I think the tree looks particularly beautiful
in this light. Don't you?

09:01.279 --> 09:04.715
If by "beautiful" you mean "unbelievably
ugly," then, yes, I would agree.

09:08.820 --> 09:12.551
You're just visually challenged.
I feel sorry for you.

09:13.224 --> 09:15.124
"Visually challenged"?

09:15.326 --> 09:16.623
"Visually challenged"?

09:16.795 --> 09:21.027
This from the girl who lived in a house
that was the joke of the neighborhood?

09:21.566 --> 09:25.468
They had bushes growing over windows
and weeds all over the place.

09:26.037 --> 09:28.130
It bugged my dad bigtime.

09:28.306 --> 09:29.466
Oh, there he is.

09:29.808 --> 09:33.972
The bricklayer who thinks he's a painter.
That truck's not ugly enough in real life?

09:34.145 --> 09:35.669
He's gotta make a painting of it?

09:35.847 --> 09:38.907
No, he does landscapes.
Sells them at the county fair.

09:39.084 --> 09:40.676
People say they're beautiful.

09:40.852 --> 09:43.582
Landscapes? Let me tell you something.

09:43.755 --> 09:45.689
The world would have
more beauty in it...

09:45.857 --> 09:49.759
...if he'd do a little landscaping
on that piece of crap he calls a yard.

09:49.928 --> 09:52.920
I feel bad for his wife.
She married a dreamer.

09:53.098 --> 09:56.465
Because of that, one of the two of them
will always be unhappy.

09:56.634 --> 10:00.001
Yeah, fine.
But why do we have to be unhappy?

10:00.638 --> 10:02.572
As annoying as the yard was
to my dad...

10:02.740 --> 10:06.232
...it was nothing compared to how annoying
Juli Baker was in that tree.

10:06.411 --> 10:08.140
Three blocks away.

10:08.313 --> 10:10.474
Every morning
we had to listen to the sound...

10:10.648 --> 10:12.707
...of her blow-by-blow traffic report.

10:12.884 --> 10:14.181
Two blocks.

10:14.352 --> 10:15.614
There you go.

10:15.820 --> 10:17.583
Why do they call it The Three Stooges?

10:17.755 --> 10:19.814
- I mean, there's five of them.
- What?

10:19.991 --> 10:23.427
Well, yeah, there's Moe, Larry, Curly,
Shemp and Curly Joe.

10:23.595 --> 10:26.496
- Yeah, but they only have three at a time.
- Yeah.

10:26.664 --> 10:29.827
You know, I hate Curly Joe.
I mean, he shouldn't even be a Stooge.

10:30.001 --> 10:32.993
Listen, girl,
I'm this close to calling the police.

10:33.171 --> 10:35.969
You are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job.

10:36.141 --> 10:38.371
- What's going on?
- Either you come down...

10:38.543 --> 10:41.706
...or we're gonna cut you down.
You guys, come up here with me.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.071
They won't cut it down
if we're all up here.

10:44.249 --> 10:46.274
- Bus, bus, bus.
- Juli was frantic.

10:46.451 --> 10:48.078
They wanted to cut down her tree.

10:48.253 --> 10:51.313
I couldn't understand why
that mutant tangle of gnarly branches...

10:51.489 --> 10:54.083
...meant so much to her.
Bryce, please.

10:54.626 --> 10:56.389
- I felt bad for her.
- Leave her.

10:56.561 --> 10:58.426
But I wasn't about to cut school over it.

10:58.596 --> 10:59.620
Come on, bro.

11:00.865 --> 11:02.924
Why isn't she your friend, Bryce?

11:04.536 --> 11:05.901
You'd have to know Juli.

11:06.070 --> 11:07.435
Well, I'd like to.

11:07.906 --> 11:08.930
Why?

11:09.641 --> 11:11.802
That girl has an iron backbone.

11:11.976 --> 11:13.807
Why don't you invite her over sometime?

11:14.379 --> 11:15.607
An iron backbone?

11:16.281 --> 11:17.805
She's just stubborn...

11:17.982 --> 11:19.609
...and she's pushy beyond belief.

11:20.351 --> 11:21.613
Is that so?

11:21.786 --> 11:24.050
And she's been stalking me
since the second grade.

11:24.889 --> 11:27.687
Well, a girl like that
doesn't live next door to everyone.

11:28.193 --> 11:29.490
Lucky them.

11:31.062 --> 11:32.586
Read this.

11:32.830 --> 11:33.922
Without prejudice.

11:39.504 --> 11:42.962
Like I needed to know
anything more about Juli Baker.

11:44.809 --> 11:47.369
Juli wasn't at the bus stop
the next morning.

11:48.813 --> 11:50.178
Or the morning after that.

11:50.782 --> 11:52.750
She was at school,
but you'd never know it.

11:52.917 --> 11:55.715
- Little Joe? He's got so much makeup on...
- He doesn't age.

11:55.887 --> 11:58.048
I told myself I should be glad about it.

11:58.223 --> 12:00.384
I mean, isn't that what
I'd always wanted?

12:00.558 --> 12:03.994
But still, I felt bad for her.

12:04.729 --> 12:07.789
I was gonna tell her I was sorry,
but then I thought, hey, no...

12:10.034 --> 12:12.525
Juli Baker thinking I missed her.

12:16.541 --> 12:18.634
I see why you like to come out here.

12:19.277 --> 12:21.541
Would you mind explaining it
to your mother?

12:21.946 --> 12:23.914
I loved to watch my father paint.

12:24.082 --> 12:26.983
Or really, I loved to hear him talk
while he painted.

12:27.151 --> 12:29.483
I learned a lot about my dad that way.

12:29.654 --> 12:31.246
He told me all sorts of things...

12:31.422 --> 12:35.620
...like how he got his first job delivering hay
and how he'd wished he'd finished college.

12:35.793 --> 12:37.761
Then one day he surprised me.

12:37.929 --> 12:42.263
What's going on with you
and, uh, Bryce Loski?

12:43.868 --> 12:45.358
What do you mean? Nothing.

12:45.637 --> 12:47.332
Oh, okay.

12:47.639 --> 12:49.231
My mistake.

12:49.707 --> 12:51.470
Why would you even think that?

12:51.643 --> 12:52.701
No reason.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.103
Just that you...

12:55.980 --> 12:57.572
...talk about him all the time.

12:58.716 --> 13:00.081
I do?

13:00.718 --> 13:02.583
Mm-hm.

13:04.989 --> 13:06.513
I don't know.

13:07.992 --> 13:10.586
I guess it's something about his eyes.

13:11.629 --> 13:13.062
Or maybe his smile.

13:14.132 --> 13:15.565
But what about him?

13:16.000 --> 13:19.561
- What?
- You have to look at the whole landscape.

13:20.571 --> 13:21.765
What does that mean?

13:22.573 --> 13:25.838
A painting is more
than the sum of its parts.

13:27.011 --> 13:30.242
A cow by itself is just a cow.

13:30.682 --> 13:35.710
A meadow by itself is just grass,
flowers.

13:36.321 --> 13:40.985
And the sun peeking through the trees
is just a beam of light.

13:41.592 --> 13:43.992
But you put them all together...

13:44.329 --> 13:46.559
...and it can be magic.

13:48.032 --> 13:51.160
I didn't really understand
what he was saying until one afternoon...

13:51.336 --> 13:53.531
...when I was up in the sycamore tree.

13:54.272 --> 13:56.172
I was rescuing a kite.

13:56.341 --> 13:59.242
It was a long way up,
higher than I'd ever been.

14:00.211 --> 14:03.977
And the higher I got,
the more amazed I was by the view.

14:04.349 --> 14:07.079
I began to notice
how wonderful the breeze smelled.

14:07.251 --> 14:09.481
Like sunshine and wild grass.

14:10.621 --> 14:12.987
I couldn't stop breathing it in...

14:13.157 --> 14:16.092
...filling my lungs
with the sweetest smell I'd ever known.

14:17.195 --> 14:18.594
Hey, you found my kite.

14:18.763 --> 14:21.425
Bryce, you should come up here.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.633
It's so beautiful.

14:23.968 --> 14:27.460
I can't. I sprained my, um...

14:27.805 --> 14:29.102
I have a rash.

14:30.241 --> 14:33.233
From that moment on,
that became my spot.

14:34.879 --> 14:38.542
I could sit there for hours,
just looking out at the world.

14:38.716 --> 14:41.014
Some days the sunsets
would be purple and pink.

14:41.185 --> 14:44.985
And some days
they were a blazing orange...

14:45.156 --> 14:47.954
...setting fire to the clouds
on the horizon.

14:48.126 --> 14:50.822
It was during one of those sunsets
that my father's idea...

14:50.995 --> 14:53.725
...of the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts...

14:53.898 --> 14:56.458
...moved from my head to my heart.

14:57.835 --> 15:01.134
Some days I would get there extra early
to watch the sunrise.

15:01.305 --> 15:03.170
One morning
I was making mental notes...

15:03.341 --> 15:06.367
...of how the streaks of light
were cutting through the clouds...

15:06.544 --> 15:08.102
...so I could tell my dad...

15:08.279 --> 15:10.679
...when I heard a noise below.

15:11.015 --> 15:12.073
Excuse me.

15:12.250 --> 15:15.344
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but you can't
park there. That's a bus stop.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.044
Hey, what are you doing up there?

15:17.221 --> 15:20.156
You can't be up there,
we're gonna take this thing down.

15:20.324 --> 15:23.225
- The tree?
- Yeah. Now come on down.

15:23.795 --> 15:26.923
- But who told you, you could cut it down?
- The owner.

15:27.432 --> 15:28.831
Why?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.434
He's gonna build a house,
and this tree's in the way.

15:31.602 --> 15:36.437
- So come on, girl, we got work to do.
- You can't cut it down. You just can't.

15:36.607 --> 15:39.474
Listen, girl.
I'm this close to calling the police.

15:39.644 --> 15:42.875
You are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job.

15:43.047 --> 15:46.107
Now either you come down,
or we're gonna cut you down.

15:46.284 --> 15:48.445
Go ahead. Cut me down.

15:48.619 --> 15:51.281
I'm not coming down.
I'm never coming down.

15:52.190 --> 15:54.055
Bryce. You guys, come up here with me.

15:54.225 --> 15:56.523
They won't cut it down
if we're all up here.

15:57.361 --> 15:59.295
Bryce, please don't let them do this.

15:59.897 --> 16:01.797
Come on, you guys.

16:02.400 --> 16:06.461
Bryce, please. You don't have to
come up this high. Just a little ways.

16:07.405 --> 16:10.431
Bryce, please. Please.

16:11.476 --> 16:13.842
What happened after that was a blur.

16:16.981 --> 16:19.313
It seemed like the whole town was there.

16:19.484 --> 16:21.611
But still I wouldn't move.

16:21.786 --> 16:23.720
Then my father showed up.

16:23.888 --> 16:27.051
He talked a fireman into letting him come up
to where I was.

16:29.961 --> 16:32.327
Sweetie, it's time to come down.

16:32.597 --> 16:34.326
Daddy, please don't let them do this.

16:34.899 --> 16:36.730
- Sweetie...
- Daddy, look.

16:36.901 --> 16:40.302
You can see everything.
You can see the whole world from here.

16:40.738 --> 16:43.571
No view is worth my daughter's safety.
Now, come on.

16:45.610 --> 16:46.975
I can't.

16:47.678 --> 16:51.170
Julianna, it's time to come down now.

16:51.682 --> 16:53.673
Please, Daddy.

16:54.652 --> 16:56.381
It's time.

17:02.827 --> 17:04.260
And that was it.

17:05.930 --> 17:08.592
I must've cried for two weeks straight.

17:10.268 --> 17:12.998
Oh, sure, I went to school
and did the best I could...

17:13.170 --> 17:14.797
...but nothing seemed to matter.

17:14.972 --> 17:17.098
- Juli?
- Huh?

17:18.142 --> 17:19.369
Do you know the answer?

17:20.744 --> 17:22.838
Uh, the Peloponnesian War?

17:23.647 --> 17:25.616
I'm sure that's the answer
to something...

17:25.782 --> 17:27.978
...but I was looking for the area
of a rhomboid.

17:31.556 --> 17:34.457
Somehow, rhomboids
and isosceles right triangles...

17:34.625 --> 17:36.889
...didn't seem so important.

17:37.495 --> 17:40.157
I rode my bike so I wouldn't have to pass
by the stump...

17:40.331 --> 17:43.858
...that used to be the earth's
most magnificent sycamore tree.

17:45.202 --> 17:48.035
But no matter what I did,
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

17:52.510 --> 17:54.205
Are you okay?

17:54.912 --> 17:57.039
It was just a tree.

17:57.214 --> 18:00.240
No, it wasn't just a tree.

18:06.824 --> 18:10.726
I never want you to forget how you felt
when you were up there.

18:13.397 --> 18:14.421
Thanks, Dad.

18:19.236 --> 18:21.602
It was the first thing I saw every morning...

18:21.772 --> 18:24.297
...and the last thing I saw
before I went to sleep.

18:24.709 --> 18:27.109
And once I could look at it
without crying...

18:27.278 --> 18:31.442
...I saw more than the tree
and what being up there meant to me.

18:32.249 --> 18:35.741
I saw the day that my view of things
around me started changing.

18:35.920 --> 18:40.050
And I wondered,
did I still feel the same things about Bryce?

18:45.796 --> 18:48.162
I've never been a huge fan of eggs.

18:48.332 --> 18:50.892
I mean, I could always just take them
or leave them.

18:51.068 --> 18:54.060
That is, until one day
in Skyler Brown's garage...

18:54.238 --> 18:56.468
...when my feelings about eggs
were solidified.

18:58.409 --> 19:02.038
Hey, hey, hey. Guys.
Edna's found her breakfast.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.708
I mean, if a slimy reptile
found them appetizing...

19:05.883 --> 19:08.613
...there was certainly no place for them
in my diet.

19:09.053 --> 19:11.521
Oh, man, that's so cool.

19:11.689 --> 19:15.090
She doesn't even have to chew.
I mean, think of all the time you'd save.

19:15.259 --> 19:18.456
I could've gone my whole life
not knowing that snakes eat eggs raw...

19:18.629 --> 19:20.153
...if it hadn't been for Lynetta.

19:20.331 --> 19:22.424
She had a major-league thing
for Skyler Brown.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.624
I think it's gross.

19:23.801 --> 19:26.463
He and Juli's brothers,
Matt and Mark, had formed a band.

19:26.637 --> 19:28.764
And Lynetta would watch them practice.

19:28.939 --> 19:30.236
That is so neat.

19:30.408 --> 19:32.069
How about that, huh, Bryce?

19:32.243 --> 19:34.074
Yeah. Neat.

19:34.245 --> 19:37.043
So, Brycie, how do you think
he's gonna digest that?

19:37.848 --> 19:40.373
- Stomach acid?
- You'd like to think that.

19:40.551 --> 19:42.815
Wait, everybody quiet. Here he goes.

19:46.624 --> 19:48.387
Eggs over easy.

19:48.559 --> 19:50.322
Gross. Gross, gross, gross.

19:50.494 --> 19:52.758
Wait, wait.
You haven't seen the best part.

19:53.898 --> 19:55.593
Ugh!

19:55.766 --> 19:57.256
Gross.

19:57.601 --> 20:00.695
I tried to be casual about it,
but it didn't take.

20:00.871 --> 20:02.634
I started having bad dreams.

20:02.807 --> 20:04.968
I'd be trapped inside a huge egg...

20:05.142 --> 20:08.578
...and this monster would open his jaws
and start to devour me.

20:08.746 --> 20:10.680
I'd wake up just in time.

20:13.617 --> 20:15.244
Then the real nightmare began.

20:15.419 --> 20:18.252
Hi, Bryce. I brought these over
for you and your family.

20:18.422 --> 20:20.219
- My chickens are laying eggs.
- What?

20:20.391 --> 20:23.827
You remember Abby and Bonnie and Clyde
and Dexter and Eunice and Florence?

20:24.395 --> 20:27.330
- The ones I hatched for the science fair.
- How could I forget?

20:28.399 --> 20:30.560
It was classic Juli Baker.

20:30.935 --> 20:33.529
She totally dominated the fair.

20:33.971 --> 20:38.135
And get this, her project
was all about watching boring eggs hatch.

20:38.709 --> 20:41.940
I mean, here I had a live-action
erupting volcano...

20:42.113 --> 20:44.377
...and all anyone cared about
was Juli's boring chicks...

20:44.548 --> 20:46.277
...breaking out of their boring shells.

20:46.450 --> 20:48.042
Oh, I think the last one's hatching.

20:48.219 --> 20:50.244
- It's hatching.
- Oh, it's hatching.

20:50.421 --> 20:51.911
Kids, come over here.

20:52.089 --> 20:54.887
But hey, she won. I lost.

20:55.059 --> 20:56.686
I've never been one to dwell.

20:56.861 --> 20:57.885
Here it comes.

20:58.062 --> 21:00.394
But that didn't mean
I had to eat her lousy eggs.

21:00.564 --> 21:03.055
I think it was very sweet of Juli
to bring us those eggs.

21:03.234 --> 21:05.668
I don't care.
I'm still having cereal tomorrow.

21:05.836 --> 21:08.771
Yeah, how do we know there's no chicks
in one of those eggs?

21:08.939 --> 21:12.340
I used to eat farm-fresh eggs
when I was a kid. They were delicious.

21:12.510 --> 21:14.341
Yeah, well, that's all well and good...

21:14.512 --> 21:17.572
...but what if we crack one open
and a dead chick falls out?

21:17.748 --> 21:21.616
Do they have a rooster? If they don't
have a rooster the eggs can't be fertile.

21:21.786 --> 21:25.347
And if they had a rooster, we'd know.
The whole neighborhood would know.

21:25.523 --> 21:27.115
Maybe they got it de-yodeled.

21:27.424 --> 21:28.448
"De-yodeled"?

21:28.759 --> 21:30.693
You know. De-cock-a-doodle-doo'd.

21:30.861 --> 21:32.522
What the hell are you talking about?

21:32.863 --> 21:34.592
Like they de-bark dogs.

21:35.833 --> 21:38.301
Bryce, why don't you just ask Juli?

21:38.469 --> 21:40.096
- I don't think that...
- What?

21:40.271 --> 21:42.637
- You afraid to talk to her?
- I'm not afraid to talk to her.

21:44.842 --> 21:46.309
I know you are, but what am I?

21:46.477 --> 21:49.378
- Okay. Just talk to her and find out.
- Bryce.

21:49.914 --> 21:51.882
How do you tell if one's a rooster?

21:52.049 --> 21:55.177
- Well, a rooster's bigger. Longer feathers.
- Mm-hm.

21:55.352 --> 21:57.786
They've got that red stuff
growing out of their head.

21:57.955 --> 22:00.947
- And around their neck too.
- That shouldn't be too hard to spot.

22:02.126 --> 22:05.584
Although, come to think of it,
chickens have the rubbery red stuff too.

22:05.763 --> 22:07.094
Just not as much.

22:07.264 --> 22:08.856
Garrett's expertise in roosters...

22:09.033 --> 22:12.525
...was the cornerstone of our plan
to avoid contact with Juli Baker.

22:12.703 --> 22:15.934
The balance of which involved
spying over her back fence.

22:16.841 --> 22:19.275
- Come on, come on.
- Shh. Shh.

22:22.713 --> 22:24.146
Over here.

22:30.721 --> 22:32.518
I can't see the stupid chickens.

22:32.690 --> 22:34.681
We gotta get them out of the coop.

22:41.131 --> 22:42.359
Is that a rooster?

22:42.533 --> 22:43.966
No, it looks like a chicken.

22:44.401 --> 22:45.959
How can you tell?

22:46.370 --> 22:47.564
It just does.

22:47.738 --> 22:49.831
See what I mean? Expertise.

22:51.876 --> 22:52.900
- Shh, shh!
- What?

22:53.077 --> 22:54.101
Juli.

22:54.278 --> 22:55.870
Here, guys.

22:56.714 --> 22:58.614
Go on, there you go.

22:59.016 --> 23:01.541
- Here, guys. Go on.
- Yeah, they're all chickens.

23:01.785 --> 23:04.515
- There's no rooster?
- What did I just say?

23:04.722 --> 23:05.848
How can you tell?

23:06.123 --> 23:08.387
- Well, none of them are strutting.
- Here, come on.

23:08.559 --> 23:10.493
- Roosters strut?
- Come on, guys.

23:10.761 --> 23:12.695
- What did I just say?
- Here.

23:13.464 --> 23:16.524
Plus, hardly any of them
have any rubbery red stuff.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.635
- What are you doing?
- Yeah. They're definitely all chickens.

23:20.437 --> 23:21.836
They're all chickens.

23:22.273 --> 23:23.433
I'm proud of you, Bryce.

23:23.607 --> 23:25.837
- You overcame your fear.
- Huh?

23:26.010 --> 23:28.911
- You talked to her.
- Oh, heh. Yeah.

23:29.480 --> 23:30.504
It's no big deal.

23:30.681 --> 23:33.081
That's what she told you?
They're all chickens?

23:33.884 --> 23:34.976
Yeah.

23:35.819 --> 23:39.585
She's a genius. You're both genius...
Of course they're all chickens.

23:40.157 --> 23:42.352
A rooster's a chicken.

23:42.593 --> 23:46.029
Is one of them a rooster
or are they all hens?

23:46.563 --> 23:49.930
Hens? Who said anything about hens?

23:50.267 --> 23:51.632
Then it hit me.

23:51.802 --> 23:54.930
Garrett didn't know jack shit
about chickens.

23:55.105 --> 23:57.835
- Do roosters strut?
- Yes, they do.

23:58.042 --> 23:59.873
What does that have to do
with anything?

24:00.377 --> 24:02.004
They're all hens.

24:04.048 --> 24:07.040
Well, the main thing is the eggs are okay.

24:07.217 --> 24:08.582
It's all settled.

24:08.752 --> 24:10.049
Not for me.

24:10.220 --> 24:12.518
There was no way
I was ever gonna eat anything...

24:12.690 --> 24:14.920
...that had anything to do
with Juli Baker.

24:15.092 --> 24:16.616
I'm not eating them.

24:17.027 --> 24:18.392
Well, why not?

24:18.562 --> 24:20.689
Have you seen their yard? It's...

24:20.864 --> 24:25.130
There's not even any grass.
It's all mud and chicken turds.

24:25.302 --> 24:28.738
Ew. Gross. Salmonella.

24:29.940 --> 24:31.840
Do you suppose
they could have salmonella?

24:32.009 --> 24:34.603
- It's not very likely.
- Why take the risk?

24:35.045 --> 24:36.478
What do we do with the eggs?

24:36.880 --> 24:37.938
Give them back.

24:38.749 --> 24:41.081
- Give them back? To Juli?
- Sure.

24:41.518 --> 24:44.578
You talked to her before, right?
It didn't kill you.

24:44.955 --> 24:46.479
Well, what do I say?

24:47.257 --> 24:48.747
Tell her we don't eat eggs.

24:50.194 --> 24:53.163
Uh, we're allergic to them or something.

24:53.497 --> 24:54.896
Come on, use your brains.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.465
It didn't feel right to lie.

24:58.635 --> 25:02.935
Besides, even a seventh grader would know
that entire families aren't allergic to eggs.

25:03.307 --> 25:05.298
But I didn't wanna
hurt her feelings either.

25:05.876 --> 25:08.140
So that left me with only one option.

25:08.312 --> 25:10.212
And thus another near-death
experience...

25:10.381 --> 25:13.680
...in my ongoing saga with Juli Baker
had been successfully avoided.

25:14.218 --> 25:15.378
Until one week later.

25:15.552 --> 25:17.747
Hi, Bryce. Brought you some more eggs.

25:17.921 --> 25:19.320
Wow.

25:19.490 --> 25:22.425
- Thanks.
- Did your family like the first batch?

25:23.060 --> 25:24.288
Do you even have to ask?

25:25.129 --> 25:27.427
Great. See you at school.

25:28.365 --> 25:30.697
What I hoped would be
a one-time event...

25:30.868 --> 25:35.100
...was just the beginning of a life consumed
with lies, intrigue and deception.

25:35.472 --> 25:37.667
Every morning
I'd be on the lookout for Juli...

25:37.841 --> 25:41.709
...so if she happened to come, I could whip
the door open before she knocked.

25:41.879 --> 25:43.244
Thanks.

25:45.215 --> 25:47.410
Then I'd dump the eggs
before anyone noticed.

25:47.584 --> 25:50.712
And why? Why couldn't I just face her?

25:52.456 --> 25:56.017
"No, thanks. Don't want them.
Don't need them. Give them to the snake"?

25:56.627 --> 25:59.562
Was I really afraid
of hurting her feelings...

26:00.130 --> 26:02.223
...or was I just afraid of her?

26:05.903 --> 26:07.734
Now, you wanna make sure you get it...

26:07.905 --> 26:11.341
When Mrs. Brubeck first suggested
hatching eggs as my science project...

26:11.508 --> 26:13.635
...I was less than excited.

26:14.111 --> 26:16.841
That is, until I saw my first sign of life.

26:17.848 --> 26:19.406
Is that it?

26:19.583 --> 26:22.484
- That's the embryo. Heh.
- Wow.

26:23.253 --> 26:26.154
- It looks like a bean.
- It does.

26:26.323 --> 26:27.756
Let's try the other ones.

26:27.925 --> 26:29.517
Suddenly it felt real.

26:29.693 --> 26:31.285
All the eggs were alive.

26:31.462 --> 26:34.397
There were, like, little bean babies
inside every one.

26:35.265 --> 26:37.859
On the day of the fair,
all six chicks hatched.

26:38.035 --> 26:39.900
What are the odds?

26:40.070 --> 26:42.766
This year's top prize goes to Juli Baker...

26:45.075 --> 26:47.600
"A Chicken is Born."

26:49.313 --> 26:51.144
I won first place.

26:51.315 --> 26:55.081
And that was cool,
but all I really cared about were my chicks.

26:55.986 --> 26:57.749
There you go. There you go, guys.

26:57.921 --> 27:00.389
My mom wasn't crazy
about us raising chickens.

27:00.557 --> 27:02.024
But I begged and pleaded.

27:02.192 --> 27:05.320
I told her I would take care of everything.
And I did.

27:05.629 --> 27:07.256
Where's Clyde?

27:09.399 --> 27:10.957
Clyde?

27:12.703 --> 27:14.694
Hey, Clyde. What's the matter?

27:14.938 --> 27:17.065
Are you okay? Aren't you hungry?

27:17.241 --> 27:20.142
Come on. Come here.
What's wrong, baby?

27:20.310 --> 27:21.470
Come here.

27:23.547 --> 27:27.039
Hey, you're not Clyde. You're Clydette.

27:27.985 --> 27:29.077
Mom!

27:30.521 --> 27:34.116
As it turned out, my hens
laid more eggs than we could eat.

27:35.025 --> 27:36.492
At first we tried to keep up...

27:37.294 --> 27:39.854
...but after a month of boiling,
frying and deviling...

27:40.030 --> 27:43.989
...like that movie The Blob,
we were being overtaken by eggs.

27:44.168 --> 27:47.797
Then opportunity in the form
of our neighbor, Mrs. Steuby, knocked.

27:47.971 --> 27:49.871
Hello, dear.

27:51.675 --> 27:55.509
If you ever have any extra,
I'd be happy to buy them from you.

27:56.346 --> 27:58.007
- Really?
- Certainly.

27:58.682 --> 28:02.118
And I happen to know that Mrs. Helms
would be interested as well.

28:03.120 --> 28:06.112
- Great.
- Nothing like fresh eggs.

28:06.290 --> 28:09.691
- Thanks, Mrs. Steuby.
- You bet, dear. Bye.

28:10.027 --> 28:14.555
Between Mrs. Steuby and Mrs. Helms,
my egg overflow problem was solved.

28:14.731 --> 28:17.461
Then I realized that Mrs. Loski
deserved eggs too.

28:17.634 --> 28:19.966
But I didn't think it would be right
to charge her.

28:20.137 --> 28:23.504
She had been such a good neighbor,
lending us supplies when we ran out...

28:23.674 --> 28:26.302
...giving my mother a ride
when our car wouldn't start...

28:26.476 --> 28:27.943
...it was the least I could do.

28:28.845 --> 28:32.713
Besides, if I happened to run into Bryce,
that wouldn't be the end of the world.

28:33.083 --> 28:34.141
Hi, Bryce.

28:34.318 --> 28:36.809
By the third time I brought eggs over
to the Loskis...

28:36.987 --> 28:38.545
...I realized Bryce was waiting for me.

28:38.722 --> 28:42.658
Waiting to pull open the door and say,
"Thanks, Juli. See you at school."

28:42.893 --> 28:45.123
And in return,
I got a few moments alone...

28:45.295 --> 28:47.126
...with the world's most dazzling eyes.

28:47.297 --> 28:50.323
Thanks, Juli. See you at school.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.331
It was a bargain.

28:52.569 --> 28:54.400
Until the day it wasn't.

28:54.571 --> 28:57.233
It was two weeks after the sycamore tree
was cut down...

28:57.407 --> 28:59.932
...and I was just starting
to feel normal again.

29:03.714 --> 29:06.080
Hey, Juli. Right on schedule.

29:06.250 --> 29:08.377
Yeah, well, neither rain nor sleet.

29:08.552 --> 29:11.043
- Huh?
- You know, the mailman thing?

29:11.655 --> 29:13.919
Oh. Right.

29:17.794 --> 29:20.354
So, um, will you start
riding the bus again?

29:21.598 --> 29:24.260
I don't know.
I haven't been up there since...

29:24.434 --> 29:27.426
It doesn't look so bad anymore.
It's all cleared away.

29:32.809 --> 29:35.778
Well, um, I better get ready for school.

29:35.946 --> 29:37.777
Guess I'll see you there.

29:37.948 --> 29:39.347
See you.

29:40.250 --> 29:41.842
Maybe Bryce was right.

29:42.019 --> 29:44.715
Maybe it was time
I started riding the bus again.

29:44.888 --> 29:48.255
After all, didn't he just tell me
he wanted me to?

29:48.425 --> 29:52.088
Could it be that Bryce Loski
actually misses me?

29:57.567 --> 30:00.092
Juli? What are you still doing here?

30:00.270 --> 30:01.737
I was just thinking.

30:03.006 --> 30:05.440
It's pickup day. The cans are in front.

30:05.609 --> 30:07.133
I know. You need some help?

30:08.578 --> 30:10.603
No. Maybe I'll do it later.

30:10.947 --> 30:12.278
Are those my eggs?

30:14.051 --> 30:16.315
Yeah. Yeah, I dropped them.

30:17.254 --> 30:18.812
They're not broken.

30:18.989 --> 30:20.820
Why are you throwing them away?

30:24.828 --> 30:25.886
Don't you want them?

30:27.064 --> 30:29.726
It wasn't me.
My dad didn't think it was worth the risk.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.599
Risk? What risk?

30:32.235 --> 30:33.327
Salmonella.

30:33.870 --> 30:36.100
What? He's afraid of being poisoned?

30:36.473 --> 30:40.068
Well, Juli, I mean, look at your back yard.
It's a complete mess.

30:40.243 --> 30:41.767
It's, like, covered in turds.

30:42.079 --> 30:44.673
That's not true.
I clean up after my girls every day.

30:47.451 --> 30:49.442
We just didn't wanna hurt your feelings.

30:52.489 --> 30:54.354
Have you always thrown them away?

30:58.895 --> 31:01.864
You know, Mrs. Steuby and Mrs. Helms
pay me for my eggs.

31:02.032 --> 31:04.660
- They do?
- They pay me 60 cents a dozen.

31:05.135 --> 31:06.193
I didn't know.

31:07.804 --> 31:09.203
How could you?

31:10.607 --> 31:12.040
I'm sorry.

31:13.877 --> 31:15.606
No, you're not.

31:31.228 --> 31:32.889
It didn't take me long to realize...

31:33.063 --> 31:35.258
...that I'd traded in my old problems
with Juli Baker...

31:35.432 --> 31:37.332
...for a whole set of new ones.

31:38.468 --> 31:42.871
It was actually worse having her mad at me
than having her annoy me.

31:43.206 --> 31:45.470
The way she ignored me
was a constant reminder...

31:45.642 --> 31:47.234
...that I'd been a jerk.

31:51.148 --> 31:54.675
Then one day I was coming home
from playing basketball with Garrett...

31:54.851 --> 31:56.045
...and things got weird.

31:56.219 --> 31:58.813
Don't be so timid.
Come on, you won't hurt them.

31:58.989 --> 32:01.514
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's it.

32:01.691 --> 32:03.249
My grandfather.

32:03.627 --> 32:08.223
All I ever saw him wear was slippers.
Now, where did he get those work boots?

32:09.266 --> 32:11.234
I couldn't stop looking over there.

32:11.401 --> 32:14.802
And the more I looked, the madder I got.

32:15.105 --> 32:17.801
My grandfather had already said
more to Juli in one hour...

32:17.974 --> 32:21.034
...than he'd said to me in the whole time
he'd been living with us.

32:21.211 --> 32:23.543
I was pretty sure
I'd never seen him laugh.

32:24.981 --> 32:27.415
And what was his deal with Juli Baker?

32:32.989 --> 32:34.684
Hi, Grandpa.

32:37.093 --> 32:38.788
Juli told me about the eggs.

32:41.064 --> 32:42.224
You know, Bryce...

32:42.399 --> 32:45.960
...one's character is set at an early age.

32:46.403 --> 32:49.372
I'd hate to see you swim out so far
you can't swim back.

32:49.539 --> 32:50.563
Sir?

32:51.508 --> 32:53.499
It's about honesty, son.

32:54.177 --> 32:56.805
Sometimes a little discomfort
in the beginning...

32:56.980 --> 32:59.778
...can save a whole lot of pain
down the road.

33:13.363 --> 33:18.130
When it came to holding a grudge,
Juli Baker was truly impressive.

33:19.436 --> 33:21.631
All week I tried to approach her
at school.

33:21.805 --> 33:24.103
She'd always find some way to duck me.

33:24.674 --> 33:29.270
And whenever she was in her yard,
Grandpa was always there with her.

33:30.947 --> 33:34.439
Finally, one Saturday I saw my opening.

33:35.051 --> 33:38.214
My grandfather had gone into town
to buy some Bengay.

33:38.622 --> 33:41.489
I guess the yard work
was starting to get to him.

33:43.260 --> 33:45.160
It's looking real good.

33:47.831 --> 33:50.994
Thanks. Chet did most of it.

33:53.236 --> 33:55.431
I'm sorry for what I did.

33:58.808 --> 34:02.039
I just don't get it, Bryce.
Why didn't you just tell me?

34:03.246 --> 34:04.907
I don't know. It was dumb.

34:05.081 --> 34:07.777
And I shouldn't have said anything
about your yard, either.

34:07.951 --> 34:09.578
It wasn't right.

34:11.054 --> 34:13.079
Maybe it's all for the best.

34:14.090 --> 34:17.992
I mean, look, I learned so much from Chet,
it's amazing.

34:19.062 --> 34:20.552
You're lucky.

34:21.231 --> 34:23.358
I don't even have grandparents anymore.

34:25.068 --> 34:26.501
Oh.

34:28.638 --> 34:30.400
I feel sorry for him.

34:31.041 --> 34:32.507
He misses your grandma.

34:34.610 --> 34:37.478
Can you believe it?
He says I remind him of her.

34:37.781 --> 34:40.079
- What?
- I know. That's what I said.

34:40.250 --> 34:44.346
But he meant it in a nice way.
Something about her spirit.

34:45.188 --> 34:46.553
Yeah.

34:47.223 --> 34:48.520
Well...

34:48.858 --> 34:51.952
Good luck with the grass.
I'm sure it'll come up great.

34:53.929 --> 34:55.362
Thanks.

34:58.368 --> 34:59.960
I guess I'll see you around.

35:00.136 --> 35:01.831
I guess so.

35:17.087 --> 35:20.454
While Juli's acceptance of
my apology was not all that I'd hoped for...

35:20.624 --> 35:23.058
...at least the eggs thing
was finally behind me.

35:23.593 --> 35:27.051
The first time in months
I could truly enjoy Bonanza.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.093
Where you going
and why you dressed like that?

35:33.169 --> 35:34.227
Skyler's.

35:34.404 --> 35:37.999
Matt and Mark are bringing over recording
stuff and they're gonna make a demo.

35:38.174 --> 35:41.075
Demo? Like they know how
to make a demo.

35:41.645 --> 35:45.103
- You don't even know them.
- I don't have to. I know the type.

35:45.915 --> 35:48.383
- You don't know anything.
- Don't talk to me like that.

35:48.551 --> 35:50.644
- I'm late.
- Be back by 11.

35:50.954 --> 35:53.946
Yep. Everything was back to normal.

36:01.197 --> 36:02.960
Is that girl working you too hard?

36:05.435 --> 36:09.098
That girl's name is Juli.
And, no, she isn't working me too hard.

36:10.006 --> 36:12.338
You've developed
quite a soft spot for her, huh?

36:12.509 --> 36:13.533
Steven.

36:14.177 --> 36:18.136
No, Patsy. Just wanna find out
why your father has the energy...

36:18.314 --> 36:20.339
...to befriend a complete stranger...

36:20.517 --> 36:23.486
...when he won't throw a baseball around
with his own grandson.

36:23.653 --> 36:26.645
- It's okay, Dad.
- No, it's not okay.

36:27.157 --> 36:28.681
Juli reminds him of Grandma.

36:28.858 --> 36:30.587
Of Renee? Heh.

36:31.194 --> 36:32.456
That's ridiculous.

36:33.963 --> 36:36.295
You know why the Bakers
haven't fixed their yard?

36:36.466 --> 36:40.459
Yeah, because he's too busy
with his paint-by-numbers kit.

36:41.304 --> 36:44.205
If you had a brother with a severe handicap,
what would you do?

36:44.874 --> 36:47.308
What the hell
does that have to do with anything?

36:47.477 --> 36:49.877
Juli's father has a retarded brother.

36:50.246 --> 36:52.942
So what? He's not the gardener,
is he? Heh.

36:53.116 --> 36:54.811
- Steven.
- Ha-ha-ha.

36:54.984 --> 36:57.009
It was a joke.

36:57.921 --> 37:00.151
You know,
other people have family troubles...

37:00.323 --> 37:03.554
...and they manage
to mow their own lawns.

37:03.927 --> 37:06.054
I don't know where their pride
in ownership is.

37:06.229 --> 37:07.526
They don't own that house.

37:08.498 --> 37:10.659
The landlord's supposed to maintain it.

37:10.834 --> 37:14.998
Mr. Baker puts every extra penny he has
into caring for his brother.

37:15.171 --> 37:18.868
Don't they have government facilities
for that sort of thing?

37:19.042 --> 37:21.738
Maybe they thought that a private facility
would be better for him.

37:21.911 --> 37:26.177
Either way, it's not our fault that their
family has some chromosomal abnormality.

37:26.349 --> 37:28.817
It has nothing to do with chromosomes.

37:29.452 --> 37:33.047
When Juli's uncle was born, he had
the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck.

37:33.223 --> 37:38.058
If he'd had enough oxygen, he would've
been a perfect little baby, just like your son.

37:41.030 --> 37:43.328
Goddamn it, Chet.

37:44.100 --> 37:46.796
- Patsy? Patsy?
- Leave me alone!

37:48.905 --> 37:50.702
Sorry about that.

37:51.141 --> 37:53.132
Why is Mom so upset?

37:56.579 --> 37:58.046
Because...

37:58.948 --> 38:01.109
...but for the grace of God...

38:01.684 --> 38:04.346
...your mother could be standing
in Mr. Baker's shoes.

38:04.521 --> 38:07.422
Did her brother have the cord
wrapped around his neck too?

38:09.726 --> 38:10.750
You did.

38:12.896 --> 38:16.457
Luckily, the doctor who delivered you
was on the ball and got it untangled...

38:16.633 --> 38:20.865
...but it easily could've gone
the other way.

38:28.211 --> 38:29.644
- Wanna go for a walk?
- Huh?

38:30.647 --> 38:33.047
I find it helps clear the mind.

38:36.252 --> 38:38.152
What would they have done with me?

38:38.922 --> 38:42.085
You can't dwell on something
that might've been, Bryce.

38:43.126 --> 38:46.755
The way my dad was talking, sounds like
he would've thrown me in a nuthouse.

38:46.930 --> 38:48.921
No, no. Now, that's not fair.

38:49.098 --> 38:52.295
You can't condemn him
for something he hasn't done.

38:57.073 --> 38:58.938
This is where that tree was, wasn't it?

38:59.108 --> 39:00.541
Yeah.

39:02.979 --> 39:05.709
Must've been a spectacular view.

39:12.121 --> 39:13.588
She's quite a girl.

39:17.026 --> 39:19.324
Some of us get dipped in flat...

39:19.796 --> 39:21.229
...some in satin...

39:21.397 --> 39:22.864
...some in gloss.

39:23.433 --> 39:25.333
But every once in a while...

39:25.501 --> 39:28.664
...you find someone who's iridescent.

39:30.406 --> 39:32.431
And when you do...

39:32.942 --> 39:34.967
...nothing will ever compare.

39:42.819 --> 39:45.014
Flat, glossy, iridescent?

39:45.488 --> 39:47.080
What the hell did that mean?

39:47.257 --> 39:50.522
Juli Baker had always
just seemed plain to me.

39:52.795 --> 39:54.490
Until now.

40:03.306 --> 40:06.571
And the way she talked about
what it felt like to be up in that tree...

40:06.743 --> 40:09.803
...to be held above the earth,
brushed by the wind.

40:09.979 --> 40:12.447
Who in junior high talks like that?

40:12.682 --> 40:15.981
This weird feeling started taking over
in the pit of my stomach...

40:16.152 --> 40:17.881
...and I didn't like it.

40:18.521 --> 40:20.284
I was slipping, man.

40:20.456 --> 40:22.321
And it was time to get a grip.

40:23.760 --> 40:26.354
I'd never been embarrassed
by where we lived before.

40:26.529 --> 40:28.759
I also never really thought about money.

40:28.932 --> 40:32.629
I knew we weren't rich, but I didn't feel
like we were missing anything.

40:32.802 --> 40:35.566
That is, until Bryce Loski
called our home a complete mess.

40:35.738 --> 40:38.764
- What's your name?
- [SINGING] What's your name?

40:38.942 --> 40:41.877
Is it Mary or Sue?

40:42.045 --> 40:44.309
What's your name?

40:44.480 --> 40:47.347
Do I stand a chance with you?

40:47.517 --> 40:51.783
It's so hard to find a personality

40:51.955 --> 40:54.389
With charms like yours for me

40:54.557 --> 40:58.687
Ooh-ee, ooh-ee, ooh-ee

40:59.462 --> 41:01.828
I had to do something
and I knew what it was.

41:01.998 --> 41:04.967
What's your name?

41:11.407 --> 41:13.967
- Oh, you're sounding really good.
- Yeah.

41:14.143 --> 41:16.077
We'll record it in Skyler's garage.

41:16.346 --> 41:18.041
That's a wonderful project.

41:18.514 --> 41:21.881
Speaking of projects, I was thinking
it might be cool to fix up the yard.

41:22.051 --> 41:24.281
- What?
- I mean, how much can grass seed cost?

41:24.454 --> 41:27.446
I could plant a lawn,
maybe some flowers.

41:27.623 --> 41:29.113
I could even put up a fence.

41:29.592 --> 41:33.756
Honey, that's a major undertaking.

41:34.230 --> 41:37.996
- I could pay for it with my egg money.
- No. That's your money.

41:38.167 --> 41:41.159
The landlord should be the one
taking care of all this.

41:41.804 --> 41:44.932
But he doesn't. And we live here.

41:46.109 --> 41:47.906
And it looks so bad.

41:49.445 --> 41:50.912
Jules.

41:51.714 --> 41:52.942
What's going on?

41:53.916 --> 41:55.474
Nothing, Dad.

41:57.487 --> 41:59.216
It's okay, sweetheart.

41:59.956 --> 42:01.617
You can tell us.

42:04.527 --> 42:08.293
The Loskis have been throwing away my
eggs because they're afraid of salmonella.

42:08.765 --> 42:10.892
Because our yard is such a mess.

42:12.235 --> 42:13.532
Did Patsy say that?

42:14.203 --> 42:17.036
No. Bryce did.

42:19.675 --> 42:22.269
But it must have been
a family discussion.

42:22.779 --> 42:25.213
A boy doesn't come up with that
on his own.

42:25.548 --> 42:27.709
- Who cares what they think?
- Yeah, who cares?

42:27.884 --> 42:30.114
- I care.
- Trina.

42:30.653 --> 42:31.813
Let's not get into this.

42:31.988 --> 42:34.388
No, I'm tired of living like this, Richard.

42:35.191 --> 42:38.354
I'm tired of having to take temp jobs
just to make ends meet.

42:38.528 --> 42:41.725
I'm tired of having to push a chair up
against the washing machine...

42:41.898 --> 42:43.331
...just to keep the door shut.

42:43.933 --> 42:46.731
I'm tired of having to borrow
Mrs. Steuby's vacuum cleaner...

42:46.903 --> 42:48.803
...every time ours breaks down.

42:48.971 --> 42:51.337
Do you think this is the life
I pictured for us?

42:52.608 --> 42:55.406
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
to do the right thing.

42:55.578 --> 43:00.208
We always end up agreeing that Devonhurst
is the right thing for Daniel.

43:00.516 --> 43:04.043
Well, maybe we should start thinking
about what's right for us.

43:04.387 --> 43:07.754
Our daughter is suffering
because we won't fix up our own yard.

43:08.091 --> 43:10.321
It's not our yard.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.859
How can you say that, Richard? How?

43:14.630 --> 43:16.188
We've lived here for 12 years...

43:16.365 --> 43:20.324
...and for 12 years we've been saying
it's temporary, but it's not.

43:20.636 --> 43:22.331
This is our home.

43:22.672 --> 43:25.903
Is it wrong to wanna live somewhere
you can be proud of?

43:26.075 --> 43:29.238
To have enough to send your kids
to college?

43:29.712 --> 43:31.839
Maybe it's time
we considered government care.

43:32.014 --> 43:35.211
We are not moving my brother.

43:35.718 --> 43:37.982
He's more important
than your own children?

43:38.154 --> 43:39.382
- Dad!
- How dare you!

43:39.555 --> 43:43.184
Stop it, Dad! Please, just stop.

43:45.328 --> 43:49.025
I'm sorry. Julianna, this is not your fault.

43:49.799 --> 43:52.597
We'll work this out, I promise.

43:54.203 --> 43:58.037
That was the first time I ever heard
my parents really yell at each other.

43:59.242 --> 44:00.334
I'm sorry about tonight.

44:00.510 --> 44:02.876
That night they each came into my room.

44:03.045 --> 44:05.946
My father talked about his brother
and how much he loved him...

44:06.115 --> 44:09.050
...and how he promised his parents
he'd always take care of him.

44:10.153 --> 44:12.621
My mother talked about how much
she loved my father...

44:12.788 --> 44:14.847
...for his strength and kind heart.

44:15.091 --> 44:16.490
When she kissed me good night...

44:16.659 --> 44:20.595
...she whispered that of all her
many blessings, I was her best.

44:23.266 --> 44:25.029
I felt sorry for my father.

44:25.201 --> 44:26.930
I felt sorry for my mother.

44:27.103 --> 44:31.199
But most of all,
I felt lucky for me that they were mine.

44:32.975 --> 44:35.739
I wanted to think the reason
I started working on my yard...

44:35.912 --> 44:39.143
...had nothing to do with Bryce.
It was about making our house better.

44:39.315 --> 44:43.115
After what he did with the eggs,
why should I care what he thought?

44:43.386 --> 44:44.410
But I did.

44:44.587 --> 44:47.147
Are you pruning that
or trying to hack it to death?

44:49.859 --> 44:52.987
Hi. I'm Chet Duncan,
Bryce's grandfather.

44:53.162 --> 44:56.029
Sorry it's taken me so long
to come over and introduce myself.

44:56.199 --> 44:57.826
Nice to meet you.

44:58.301 --> 45:01.099
So are you trimming all these
to the same height?

45:01.270 --> 45:03.864
Well, yeah, that's what I was thinking,
but I don't know.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.031
Do you think it would look better
to take them out?

45:06.209 --> 45:10.703
Oh, these are Hicksii shrubs.
These will prune up nicely.

45:14.050 --> 45:15.278
Listen, Mr. Duncan.

45:15.451 --> 45:17.146
Call me Chet.

45:17.553 --> 45:18.850
Chet.

45:19.288 --> 45:21.722
If you're here
because of what Bryce said...

45:22.158 --> 45:23.455
...I don't need your help.

45:25.528 --> 45:27.689
Read about you in the paper.

45:28.764 --> 45:31.130
Renee would've sat up in that tree
with you.

45:31.834 --> 45:34.769
She would've sat up there all night.

45:35.571 --> 45:36.663
Renee?

45:37.306 --> 45:38.864
My wife.

45:39.709 --> 45:41.233
You remind me a lot of her.

45:46.682 --> 45:48.343
We worked on the yard for weeks.

45:48.517 --> 45:51.315
And the whole time we worked,
we talked.

45:52.188 --> 45:53.553
- Right there?
- Perfect, yeah.

45:53.723 --> 45:56.556
He wanted to know more
about the sycamore tree.

45:56.826 --> 45:58.293
He knew exactly what it meant...

45:58.461 --> 46:01.157
...about the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts.

46:01.464 --> 46:03.329
He said it was the same with people...

46:03.499 --> 46:06.366
...but sometimes with people,
the whole could be less.

46:06.869 --> 46:08.894
I thought that was pretty interesting.

46:09.071 --> 46:12.006
I started looking at people
I'd known since elementary school...

46:12.174 --> 46:15.701
...trying to figure out if they were more
or less than the sum of their parts.

46:18.614 --> 46:21.913
Chet was right. A lot of them were less.

46:24.620 --> 46:28.556
Of all my classmates, the one person
I couldn't seem to place was Bryce.

46:33.462 --> 46:36.124
Until recently, I would've said
with absolute certainty...

46:36.299 --> 46:40.099
...that he was greater, far greater,
than the sum of his parts.

46:40.269 --> 46:41.793
But now I wasn't so sure.

46:41.971 --> 46:44.804
It's looking good, Juli. Nice job.

46:45.574 --> 46:48.600
Thanks. Chet did most of it.

46:51.447 --> 46:53.642
I'm sorry for what I did.

46:57.019 --> 46:58.919
I just don't get it, Bryce.

46:59.088 --> 47:01.022
Why didn't you just tell me?

47:01.190 --> 47:02.714
Was he really sorry?

47:02.892 --> 47:05.861
Or was he just saying these things
to make himself feel better?

47:06.162 --> 47:09.654
Then I thought maybe I just wanted him
to be more than the sum of his parts.

47:10.499 --> 47:12.729
But as I looked into his eyes...

47:12.902 --> 47:15.029
...those dazzling eyes...

47:15.838 --> 47:17.465
...for the first time...

47:17.640 --> 47:20.609
...I was pretty sure
that Bryce Loski was less.

47:30.219 --> 47:33.313
We're going to invite the Bakers
over for dinner.

47:33.489 --> 47:35.650
- What?
- I don't know, Mom.

47:35.825 --> 47:37.554
I think that's a marvelous idea.

47:37.727 --> 47:39.854
Patsy, what purpose does this serve?

47:40.029 --> 47:42.395
Trina Baker is a very nice person.

47:42.565 --> 47:45.898
- And Matt and Mark are really cool.
- I hate cool.

47:46.068 --> 47:48.127
Something we should've done years ago.

47:48.304 --> 47:50.795
Yeah, but we didn't. And now we can't.

47:50.973 --> 47:53.271
The statute of limitations has run out.

47:54.009 --> 47:56.204
We're having the Bakers over for dinner.

47:58.614 --> 48:03.244
If this is about what I said last night,
I'm sorry, okay?

48:03.419 --> 48:06.820
But, you know, having them over for dinner
is not gonna fix his brother.

48:07.256 --> 48:09.053
It's going to be a sit-down dinner.

48:09.225 --> 48:11.921
And I expect everyone
to dress accordingly.

48:12.161 --> 48:14.186
Oh, God. Can't we just have a barbecue?

48:14.363 --> 48:17.389
It's going to be a sit-down dinner.

48:19.034 --> 48:20.729
Just shoot me now.

48:21.070 --> 48:22.970
Careful what you wish for.

48:23.739 --> 48:24.899
So that was it.

48:25.074 --> 48:29.704
A dress-up, sit-down dinner with Juli Baker
was in my immediate future.

48:31.647 --> 48:34.377
And that made seeing Juli at school
more uncomfortable.

48:34.884 --> 48:37.011
I found myself staring at her in class.

48:37.186 --> 48:39.654
And the way her hair fell back
over her shoulders...

48:39.822 --> 48:42.256
...she looked just like the picture
in the newspaper.

48:43.959 --> 48:45.950
Dana Tressler caught me watching.

48:46.128 --> 48:49.063
If I didn't do something fast,
this could spread like wildfire.

48:49.231 --> 48:50.926
There was a bee in her hair.

48:52.001 --> 48:53.093
See, there it goes.

48:55.971 --> 48:57.871
There's no bee.

48:58.040 --> 48:59.871
It flew out the window.

49:00.676 --> 49:03.440
I convinced myself I'd dodged a bullet.

49:04.346 --> 49:06.610
I had to put Juli out of my mind.

49:06.782 --> 49:10.218
Keep the focus on the important stuff
like schoolwork.

49:13.222 --> 49:15.053
My weakness was unnerving.

49:16.559 --> 49:17.583
I need your sharpener.

49:17.760 --> 49:20.695
- You ever heard of knocking?
- Hey, what you got there? Dad's Playboy?

49:20.963 --> 49:22.225
None of your business.

49:22.465 --> 49:25.161
- Give my best to Miss October.
- Get out.

49:25.568 --> 49:27.866
- Or should I say your best? Ha, ha.
- You're disgusting.

49:29.572 --> 49:31.767
Another disaster avoided.

49:31.941 --> 49:34.273
My life had become a minefield.

49:34.810 --> 49:34.910
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

49:34.910 --> 49:36.935
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

49:38.914 --> 49:40.438
What's this?

49:40.616 --> 49:41.878
Whoa.

49:42.518 --> 49:44.418
It's not what you think.

49:45.688 --> 49:48.316
Okay, it is what you think,
but I can explain.

49:49.325 --> 49:52.123
Okay, I can't explain.
Can we just talk about it later?

49:52.294 --> 49:53.921
Whatever you say.

49:54.096 --> 49:55.723
I had to talk to someone.

49:55.965 --> 49:58.934
Why not Garrett?
Maybe he could help me get back on track.

49:59.101 --> 50:01.797
Garrett was surprisingly sensitive
in matters of the heart.

50:01.971 --> 50:04.235
Are you freaking mental? Juli Baker.
You hate her.

50:04.406 --> 50:07.569
That's what's weird. I don't think I do.
I can't stop thinking about her.

50:07.743 --> 50:10.439
- You got it bad, man.
- Well, what do I do?

50:10.613 --> 50:13.639
Well, you gotta nip this in the bud.
These aren't real emotions.

50:13.816 --> 50:16.444
- They're not?
- You feel guilty because of the egg thing.

50:16.619 --> 50:18.086
Yeah, and I insulted her yard.

50:18.254 --> 50:20.484
Exactly. Of course,
the place is a dump anyways.

50:20.656 --> 50:24.183
Her dad's got a retarded brother
and all their money goes to helping him.

50:24.360 --> 50:27.022
A retard? Well, shoot,
that ought to tell you something.

50:27.363 --> 50:29.797
- About what?
- About Juli.

50:30.666 --> 50:31.758
What are you saying?

50:32.334 --> 50:34.268
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

50:34.436 --> 50:37.132
I couldn't believe it.
I wanted to yell at him.

50:37.306 --> 50:40.104
Tell him that he didn't know Juli
like I did.

50:43.078 --> 50:44.739
Heh, oh.

50:44.914 --> 50:47.382
- Right.
- Yeah.

50:47.550 --> 50:50.815
Right. Um, I'll talk to you later.

50:53.422 --> 50:55.856
I was supposed to go
to Garrett's after school...

50:56.025 --> 50:57.617
...but I couldn't be around him.

50:57.793 --> 50:59.488
He'd crossed the line.

50:59.662 --> 51:03.291
And standing right next to him
across that line was my father.

51:03.766 --> 51:05.700
I didn't care what they thought.

51:05.901 --> 51:08.199
I liked Juli Baker.

51:11.373 --> 51:13.534
Sunday mornings
are peaceful in our house.

51:13.709 --> 51:15.540
My dad lets himself sleep in.

51:15.711 --> 51:17.838
My mother lets herself not fix breakfast.

51:18.013 --> 51:20.777
If my brothers have been out late
playing with their band...

51:20.950 --> 51:23.282
...you won't even know they're around
till noon.

51:23.452 --> 51:26.387
But this Sunday, I woke up feeling weird.

51:26.555 --> 51:29.854
I had to do something to shake off
the confused feelings about Bryce...

51:30.025 --> 51:32.050
...that were starting to creep back in.

51:39.768 --> 51:43.260
You really did it, didn't you? Heh.

51:44.306 --> 51:47.332
- Proud of you.
- Thanks, Dad.

51:47.676 --> 51:51.510
- Where you going?
- To see Daniel. It's his birthday.

51:53.315 --> 51:54.441
I wanna come with you.

51:55.084 --> 51:58.417
Oh, honey, just enjoy the morning,
stay with your mom.

51:59.955 --> 52:02.446
No, Dad. I wanna come.

52:03.492 --> 52:05.323
Sweetheart, listen.

52:05.494 --> 52:07.519
Sometimes, with Daniel...

52:07.696 --> 52:09.391
I'm coming, Dad.

52:12.334 --> 52:13.767
Okay.

52:14.837 --> 52:16.998
We'd better leave a note for your mother.

52:19.608 --> 52:22.509
In all the years,
I'd never visited my Uncle Daniel.

52:22.678 --> 52:25.977
I don't know why.
It was always something my dad did alone.

52:27.149 --> 52:30.949
We didn't say much to each other on
the drive to Devonhurst, but I didn't care.

52:31.754 --> 52:33.847
I just liked being with my dad.

52:34.356 --> 52:38.224
Somehow the silence seemed to connect us
in a way that words never could.

52:56.812 --> 53:00.680
The residents tend to the grounds
as part of their therapy.

53:03.752 --> 53:07.688
It takes some getting used to.
They're good people, though.

53:09.091 --> 53:10.615
Daniel?

53:11.393 --> 53:12.451
Daniel.

53:13.429 --> 53:16.626
Richard! You're here!

53:16.799 --> 53:18.926
Richard for my birthday.

53:19.101 --> 53:21.126
Who? Richard, who? Who?

53:21.303 --> 53:22.964
Who? Who? Richard, who? Who?

53:23.138 --> 53:25.868
Daniel, Daniel, it's Julianna.
It's my daughter.

53:26.542 --> 53:28.100
Your niece.

53:29.912 --> 53:31.607
Julianna.

53:31.780 --> 53:34.374
- Ha, Julianna.
- Happy birthday, Uncle Daniel.

53:34.550 --> 53:37.519
Ha-ha-ha. Richard. It's my birthday.

53:37.953 --> 53:41.047
I have your pictures, Julianna.
I have your pictures.

53:41.223 --> 53:44.021
We have a present for you.

53:44.193 --> 53:45.626
A puzzle? A puzzle, Richard?

53:45.794 --> 53:47.386
Not just a puzzle.

53:47.563 --> 53:50.157
A puzzle and a...

53:50.766 --> 53:51.790
...pinwheel.

53:51.967 --> 53:55.232
A pinwheel! Thank you, Richard.

53:55.404 --> 53:56.894
Yes.

53:59.675 --> 54:01.404
Orange. Outside? Outside, Richard?

54:01.977 --> 54:04.969
You wanna go outside?
All right, we'll go to, uh, McEIliot's.

54:05.147 --> 54:07.547
- We'll walk out there for an ice cream.
- Ice cream!

54:07.716 --> 54:10.344
Oh, no. No, no, we can't.

54:10.519 --> 54:12.487
Daniel doesn't like ice cream.

54:12.921 --> 54:14.513
Aw.

54:16.058 --> 54:19.585
- I do like ice cream, Richard.
- I'm only kidding.

54:19.762 --> 54:21.457
- I know you like ice cream.
- Ahh!

54:21.630 --> 54:24.030
You love ice cream. All right, come on.

54:30.339 --> 54:32.170
- Here you go. Got it?
- Ah!

54:32.341 --> 54:33.501
Here you go.

54:33.675 --> 54:35.438
It's my birthday.

54:40.282 --> 54:42.273
Lollipop. It's my birthday.

54:47.256 --> 54:49.019
You like it? Oh!

54:50.926 --> 54:53.759
- All right, Daniel. Okay, wait, wait.
- Ice cream. Ice cream.

54:53.929 --> 54:56.693
- My ice cream. My ice cream. Ugh!
- It's okay. Daniel.

54:57.699 --> 54:59.064
Daniel!

54:59.902 --> 55:01.369
Daniel! Leave it, I'll get y...

55:01.537 --> 55:03.562
Ice cream on the floor.
Ice cream on the floor.

55:03.739 --> 55:05.764
Would you go get him another cone?

55:06.241 --> 55:08.539
- Yeah.
- I need ice cream, Richard!

55:08.710 --> 55:11.577
It's my birthday, Richard.
It's my birthday!

55:11.747 --> 55:14.113
Ice cream, Richard! Ice cream, Richard!

55:14.583 --> 55:16.141
Stop! Stop it!

55:16.318 --> 55:17.808
- I need it!
- Stop it! Stop it!

55:20.255 --> 55:22.223
- Here we go.
- Ice cream!

55:22.391 --> 55:23.881
Aah!

55:24.059 --> 55:27.392
- Richard!
- Okay, okay. I've got some ice cream.

55:28.997 --> 55:32.023
Birthday ice cream. That's good, Richard.

55:32.201 --> 55:34.601
I'm so sorry.
He hasn't done anything like that...

55:34.770 --> 55:38.467
I'd often heard my father talk about
how difficult life was for Daniel.

55:38.941 --> 55:41.705
But I never really understood it until now.

55:42.845 --> 55:45.245
- Yeah, there you go.
- Heh. Orange.

55:45.414 --> 55:48.076
On the walk back,
Daniel acted like nothing had happened.

55:48.250 --> 55:49.842
Other way. Other way.

55:50.686 --> 55:53.154
On the ride home,
my dad told me that Uncle Daniel...

55:53.322 --> 55:56.155
...used to live with him and Mom
before we were born.

55:56.325 --> 55:59.260
But after a while, it became too difficult.

56:00.762 --> 56:03.595
When we got home,
everything looked the same.

56:03.765 --> 56:05.392
But it wasn't.

56:05.567 --> 56:08.934
Before today, Daniel had always been
just a name to me.

56:09.104 --> 56:11.299
Now he was part of the family.

56:18.380 --> 56:20.211
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:23.752 --> 56:24.878
How'd it go?

56:25.721 --> 56:26.813
I'm glad I went.

56:26.989 --> 56:28.752
I'm glad you went too.

56:29.691 --> 56:33.752
Trina, it's Sunday.
What are you doing mopping the floor?

56:34.630 --> 56:37.656
Patty Loski invited us over for dinner
Friday night.

56:38.500 --> 56:40.661
Shouldn't she be mopping her floor?

56:40.836 --> 56:42.736
Or did she ask to borrow ours?

56:44.506 --> 56:46.201
Nervous energy.

56:46.808 --> 56:49.140
- Did she invite all of us?
- Yes, she did.

56:49.311 --> 56:52.337
Even our friend Sal Monella?

56:52.814 --> 56:53.872
Richard.

56:54.049 --> 56:56.677
Why, after all these years?

56:56.852 --> 57:01.482
Well, she said she felt really bad
that they hadn't invited us before...

57:02.024 --> 57:04.822
...and apparently they want
to get to know us better.

57:05.160 --> 57:06.991
And you wanna go?

57:07.596 --> 57:09.461
Well, she insisted.

57:10.465 --> 57:12.763
And I think it would be really nice.

57:14.870 --> 57:16.167
All right.

57:16.605 --> 57:18.163
We'll go.

57:18.607 --> 57:21.041
I wasn't too thrilled about dinner
with the Loskis...

57:21.209 --> 57:24.269
...but I could see it meant a lot
to my mother.

57:25.647 --> 57:28.115
At school the next day,
I couldn't seem to concentrate.

57:28.784 --> 57:31.252
My thoughts kept running back to Daniel.

57:31.420 --> 57:34.787
I wondered what my grandparents
had gone through having a son like him...

57:34.957 --> 57:36.356
...when reality interrupted.

57:36.525 --> 57:39.050
- Bryce Loski likes you.
- What?

57:39.227 --> 57:41.195
He's got a big crush on you.

57:41.363 --> 57:44.491
What are you talking about?
Bryce Loski does not have a crush on me.

57:44.666 --> 57:47.191
Oh, yeah?
In science, I caught him staring at you.

57:47.369 --> 57:49.860
He said it was because there was a bee
in your hair.

57:50.038 --> 57:51.938
Is that the lamest cover-up or what?

57:53.041 --> 57:54.201
Maybe there was a bee.

57:54.376 --> 57:57.812
The only bee you're attracting
is B-R-Y-C-E.

57:57.980 --> 58:01.211
I'm telling you,
that boy is lost in love land.

58:01.383 --> 58:02.748
- Come on.
- Where?

58:02.918 --> 58:05.580
I saw him sneaking off with Garrett.
Come on.

58:07.356 --> 58:10.348
Are you freaking mental?
Juli Baker. You hate her.

58:10.525 --> 58:12.459
That's what's so weird. I don't think I do.

58:12.627 --> 58:13.889
I can't stop thinking about her.

58:14.062 --> 58:16.622
- You got it bad, man.
- What do I do?

58:16.965 --> 58:18.455
You gotta nip this in the bud.

58:18.633 --> 58:20.931
- These aren't real emotions.
- They're not?

58:21.103 --> 58:23.162
You feel guilty because of the egg thing.

58:23.338 --> 58:24.828
Yeah, and I insulted her yard.

58:25.007 --> 58:27.168
Exactly. The place is a dump anyways.

58:27.342 --> 58:31.073
Her dad's got a retarded brother
and all their money goes to helping him.

58:31.246 --> 58:33.510
A retard?
Well, that ought to tell you something.

58:33.682 --> 58:36.082
- About what?
- About Juli.

58:36.585 --> 58:37.779
What are you saying?

58:37.953 --> 58:40.353
The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, my friend.

58:40.522 --> 58:43.855
- Oh, heh. Yeah. Right.
- Yeah.

58:44.026 --> 58:45.857
I'll talk to you later.

58:46.028 --> 58:47.359
Okay.

58:50.232 --> 58:52.257
I'm sorry. I thought...

58:52.434 --> 58:55.198
It's okay. It's fine.

58:55.370 --> 58:56.769
And it was.

58:56.938 --> 58:58.997
Because now my confusion was gone.

58:59.174 --> 59:03.508
I was sure I no longer liked
Bryce Loski.

59:06.314 --> 59:09.374
Mom, are you trying to make the Bakers
feel totally worthless?

59:09.551 --> 59:11.519
I want it to be nice.

59:12.687 --> 59:15.178
- And why aren't you dressed?
- I'm going.

59:17.359 --> 59:19.657
I wanted to look good for Juli.

59:19.828 --> 59:23.195
But I didn't want her to think
that I wanted to look good for her.

59:23.665 --> 59:25.690
It was a fine line.

59:30.472 --> 59:32.804
A very fine line.

59:35.310 --> 59:38.040
Bryce, they're here. Come on down.

59:38.213 --> 59:39.680
Coming!

59:41.316 --> 59:42.977
Hey, come on in.

59:43.151 --> 59:45.585
- Come in, come in.
- There goes the waistline.

59:45.754 --> 59:48.518
I'm glad you could make it.
Lynetta, Steven, company's here.

59:48.690 --> 59:51.022
- Coming!
- What is this? Homemade pie?

59:51.193 --> 59:54.026
Yes, it's pecan
and blueberry cheesecake.

59:54.196 --> 59:55.663
Let's take them to the kitchen.

59:55.831 --> 59:57.230
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, looking good.

59:57.399 --> 59:59.264
- This is my dad.
- Hi, I'm Lynetta.

59:59.434 --> 01:00:01.902
- Hi, nice to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:04.197
- My boys are telling me that...
- Hey, big guy.

01:00:04.372 --> 01:00:05.771
Hey, Steven. How are you?

01:00:05.941 --> 01:00:08.705
We should've done this a long time ago.
Come on in.

01:00:09.277 --> 01:00:10.301
This is a cool place.

01:00:10.479 --> 01:00:13.414
Yeah, it's all right.
Come on, I'll show you my room.

01:00:14.616 --> 01:00:16.584
You gotta hear this new song we wrote.

01:00:16.751 --> 01:00:17.979
It's so good.

01:00:18.153 --> 01:00:19.552
Hi.

01:00:25.093 --> 01:00:26.526
You look nice.

01:00:27.262 --> 01:00:30.231
I heard you and Garrett
making fun of my uncle in the library.

01:00:30.398 --> 01:00:32.127
And I don't wanna speak to you.

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.268
Not now, not ever.

01:00:36.805 --> 01:00:39.205
- And I say you can.
- But what you're proposing...

01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:43.868
...would require a perpetual-motion
machine, so it's not possible.

01:00:44.045 --> 01:00:47.105
If you had two opposite charged poles
with a neutral conductor...

01:00:47.649 --> 01:00:48.877
Perpetual motion?

01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:52.747
Here I was, dying inside, and they
were talking about perpetual motion.

01:00:52.921 --> 01:00:54.946
And how did Juli know
about all that stuff?

01:00:55.123 --> 01:00:57.853
Come on, everybody, dinner's ready.
Lynetta!

01:00:58.026 --> 01:00:59.425
Dinner!

01:00:59.594 --> 01:01:00.754
Juli, can I talk to you?

01:01:04.332 --> 01:01:07.631
It was wrong, what Garrett said.
I know it.

01:01:07.802 --> 01:01:09.895
Did you know it was wrong
when he said it?

01:01:10.205 --> 01:01:13.140
Yeah. I wanted to punch him.

01:01:13.308 --> 01:01:15.276
But we were in the library.

01:01:15.577 --> 01:01:17.841
So instead you just agreed with him
and laughed.

01:01:18.647 --> 01:01:20.171
Yeah.

01:01:21.816 --> 01:01:23.807
Then that makes you a coward.

01:01:27.956 --> 01:01:30.288
I had to sit across from Juli
for an entire dinner.

01:01:30.992 --> 01:01:32.289
My dad was right.

01:01:32.928 --> 01:01:34.691
We should have barbecued.

01:01:35.096 --> 01:01:38.691
I just want to say how wonderful it is
to have you share a meal with us.

01:01:38.867 --> 01:01:40.858
May it be the first of many.

01:01:42.904 --> 01:01:43.928
Wrong pipe.

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.867
Well, we couldn't be happier.

01:01:48.043 --> 01:01:51.376
We are just all so thrilled to be here.

01:02:01.056 --> 01:02:03.786
Juli, you did a really nice job
on your yard.

01:02:04.292 --> 01:02:06.954
Thanks. Chet was a big help.

01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:08.887
Yeah, I know.

01:02:09.064 --> 01:02:12.431
You gotta tell me your secret.
I can't get him to do a thing around here.

01:02:12.601 --> 01:02:14.933
- Steven.
- I kid.

01:02:17.372 --> 01:02:21.832
I'm telling you, the neighborhood
is really coming to life.

01:02:22.844 --> 01:02:25.904
I mean, that new house is taking shape.

01:02:26.081 --> 01:02:27.241
Which one?

01:02:27.616 --> 01:02:30.244
You know, the one where they cut down
that big ugly tree.

01:02:31.786 --> 01:02:35.916
I wanted to say that a lot of people
liked that tree, but I didn't.

01:02:36.524 --> 01:02:38.685
I didn't want to go against my dad.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:42.655
Some people thought that tree
was the jewel of the neighborhood.

01:02:42.831 --> 01:02:45.664
Yeah, well,
there's no accounting for taste.

01:02:48.236 --> 01:02:51.433
So, Matt, Mark, Mark, Matt...

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.140
You guys are, uh, gonna be
graduating soon, huh?

01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:56.209
Yeah, thank God.

01:02:57.178 --> 01:02:58.440
You don't like high school?

01:02:59.414 --> 01:03:01.609
- You kidding?
- No.

01:03:01.983 --> 01:03:04.417
High school was the best time of my life.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.785
- Not for us, no.
- Yeah, we've had enough of that scene.

01:03:08.957 --> 01:03:10.185
Ah.

01:03:10.358 --> 01:03:13.191
So college is probably
out of the question, huh?

01:03:13.561 --> 01:03:14.687
No, it's a possibility.

01:03:14.863 --> 01:03:16.421
They've actually been accepted...

01:03:16.598 --> 01:03:18.896
...at several places already.
- Yes, they have.

01:03:19.067 --> 01:03:20.500
Really?

01:03:20.902 --> 01:03:22.767
Well, that's good.

01:03:23.371 --> 01:03:26.966
But, um,
we're gonna give music a shot first.

01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:30.776
- Really?
- Oh, they are very talented.

01:03:30.945 --> 01:03:32.970
Oh, their band is really boss.

01:03:33.148 --> 01:03:35.708
They did a bunch of demos
and they're really cool.

01:03:36.284 --> 01:03:37.376
Thanks, Lyn.

01:03:37.552 --> 01:03:40.715
When Steven and I first met,
he was playing in a band.

01:03:40.889 --> 01:03:42.982
You played in a band?

01:03:43.158 --> 01:03:46.753
He was a wonderful saxophone player.

01:03:47.228 --> 01:03:49.856
- Cool. You still play?
- Well, l...

01:03:50.031 --> 01:03:52.795
Well, if you want,
you can come jam out with us sometime.

01:03:54.369 --> 01:03:55.700
Uh, you...

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:57.428
No, I mean... Heh.

01:03:57.906 --> 01:03:59.396
That's not me anymore.

01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:02.134
Have you boys ever performed
in front of an audience?

01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:03.334
A lot of times.

01:04:03.511 --> 01:04:06.173
The more Matt and Mark
talked about their musical exploits...

01:04:06.348 --> 01:04:07.747
...the quieter my dad got.

01:04:08.783 --> 01:04:11.411
He tried to plaster on a smile
now and then...

01:04:11.586 --> 01:04:14.214
...but underneath he seemed really sad.

01:04:15.623 --> 01:04:18.456
But my parents didn't like him at first.

01:04:18.626 --> 01:04:21.220
Republicans fought like crazy
against the New Deal.

01:04:21.396 --> 01:04:24.024
The rest of the evening
was painless enough.

01:04:24.799 --> 01:04:28.496
But through it all,
Juli didn't say a word to me.

01:04:28.937 --> 01:04:31.337
Never even looked at me.

01:04:32.574 --> 01:04:34.769
Until she was about to leave.

01:04:35.744 --> 01:04:38.235
I'm sorry I was so angry
when we first came in.

01:04:38.413 --> 01:04:40.210
I think everyone had a good time.

01:04:41.182 --> 01:04:43.650
Your mom was really nice to invite us.

01:04:45.687 --> 01:04:46.949
See you.

01:04:47.122 --> 01:04:48.783
Her apology made things worse.

01:04:49.023 --> 01:04:52.322
- Hey, wait for me.
- I knew I wasn't forgiven.

01:04:53.261 --> 01:04:56.458
It was like I wasn't even important enough
to hold a grudge against.

01:04:56.631 --> 01:04:58.929
Well, I think they're a delightful family.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.568
Those boys were nothing like I expected.

01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:03.829
I thought they were very nice young men.

01:05:04.005 --> 01:05:05.768
- Hoodlums.
- What?

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.408
How you think they can afford
all that recording gear?

01:05:08.576 --> 01:05:12.478
Steven, please.
You can't just make an accusation like that.

01:05:12.647 --> 01:05:14.808
Don't be so naive, Patsy.

01:05:14.983 --> 01:05:17.918
Do you know how expensive it is
to record a demo?

01:05:18.086 --> 01:05:20.486
They're probably stealing hubcaps,
for chrissake.

01:05:20.655 --> 01:05:23.215
You are such an asshole.

01:05:23.658 --> 01:05:25.421
What is the matter with you?

01:05:27.362 --> 01:05:28.420
Go to hell.

01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:31.257
Don't you talk to me like that.

01:05:31.433 --> 01:05:32.593
Steven, stop!

01:05:32.767 --> 01:05:34.530
Nobody talks to me like that...

01:05:34.702 --> 01:05:36.567
...in my own house!
Stop!

01:05:36.838 --> 01:05:40.899
I'd seen my father angry before,
but this was different.

01:05:41.342 --> 01:05:42.707
As I lay in bed that night...

01:05:42.877 --> 01:05:46.244
...I thought about how my dad
always looked down on the Bakers.

01:05:46.414 --> 01:05:50.407
And how he'd called them trash
and made fun of Mr. Baker's paintings.

01:05:50.585 --> 01:05:53.145
And now I realized
he was just mad at himself.

01:05:53.321 --> 01:05:55.016
But why?

01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:57.351
Juli called me a coward.

01:05:57.525 --> 01:06:00.221
Was it possible my dad
was a coward too?

01:06:00.662 --> 01:06:02.220
I didn't know.

01:06:02.697 --> 01:06:04.255
What difference did it make?

01:06:04.432 --> 01:06:06.457
Juli Baker was out of my life.

01:06:06.634 --> 01:06:08.465
Or, more accurately...

01:06:08.636 --> 01:06:10.160
...I was out of hers.

01:06:11.439 --> 01:06:13.999
As I was getting dressed
for the Loskis' dinner party...

01:06:14.175 --> 01:06:17.235
...I found myself staring at the painting
my father had given me...

01:06:17.412 --> 01:06:19.573
...and became furious all over again.

01:06:19.747 --> 01:06:22.511
Bryce had never been
a friend to me, ever.

01:06:22.684 --> 01:06:24.675
He hadn't taken my side about the tree...

01:06:24.853 --> 01:06:26.377
...he'd thrown away my eggs...

01:06:26.554 --> 01:06:29.421
...and he made fun of me
at my uncle's expense.

01:06:29.757 --> 01:06:31.622
When my mother called
that it was time to go...

01:06:31.793 --> 01:06:33.488
Juli, let's go, we're late!

01:06:33.661 --> 01:06:37.722
I went out with every intention of
telling her that I wasn't going to the Loskis.

01:06:37.899 --> 01:06:41.335
Please hold these. I need to check my hair
really quickly one more time.

01:06:41.503 --> 01:06:43.095
- Your hair is perfect.
- Really?

01:06:43.271 --> 01:06:44.670
But she looked so happy...

01:06:44.839 --> 01:06:49.003
...and she'd gone to so much trouble
over the pies that I couldn't.

01:06:49.177 --> 01:06:51.907
Ooh! Oh, my gosh.
Oh, God, what a disaster.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.877
Okay. Here, hold one, and you hold this.

01:06:54.048 --> 01:06:56.608
- I don't wanna hold it.
- I won't have you hold it.

01:06:56.784 --> 01:06:57.842
Let's go, boys.

01:06:58.019 --> 01:07:00.146
But that didn't mean
I had to be nice to Bryce.

01:07:00.788 --> 01:07:02.312
And I don't wanna speak to you.

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:04.458
Not now, not ever.

01:07:05.159 --> 01:07:06.717
It felt good to take charge.

01:07:06.895 --> 01:07:10.353
I felt strong, in control.
I told Bryce what I thought...

01:07:10.532 --> 01:07:13.797
...and I was determined not to talk to him
for the rest of the evening.

01:07:14.736 --> 01:07:18.638
At dinner it struck me that we were sharing
a meal with a group of strangers.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.838
We'd lived across the street
from the Loskis for years...

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:26.140
...but except for Chet,
I didn't know these people at all.

01:07:26.948 --> 01:07:29.610
Mr. Loski was clean and smooth
on the outside...

01:07:29.784 --> 01:07:33.686
...but it seemed like there was something
rotten buried just beneath the surface.

01:07:36.391 --> 01:07:40.851
By the end of the evening,
all I felt was detached, neutral.

01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:43.463
No fireworks, no leftover anger...

01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:45.929
...no flutters, nothing.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.226
See you.

01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:50.629
I went to bed that night feeling peaceful.

01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:51.829
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:07:52.006 --> 01:07:54.474
I was grateful that I had the family I had.

01:07:56.344 --> 01:07:59.836
And it felt good to no longer care
about Bryce Loski.

01:08:05.887 --> 01:08:08.685
The dinner with the Bakers
had taken its toll on me.

01:08:09.157 --> 01:08:11.717
Then the annual
school fundraiser arrived...

01:08:11.893 --> 01:08:15.226
...and I found myself
with a whole new set of problems.

01:08:16.798 --> 01:08:18.959
I was a Basketboy.

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:22.095
To fully appreciate the humiliation
of being a Basketboy...

01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:26.399
...you need to know that the chosen few are
auctioned off in front of the student body...

01:08:26.573 --> 01:08:28.166
...to the highest-bidding females.

01:08:28.343 --> 01:08:31.243
Yes, technically, each of us
comes with a lunch in a basket...

01:08:31.412 --> 01:08:34.676
...but let's not kid ourselves.
This was a beefcake parade.

01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:36.475
There he is, my idol.

01:08:36.651 --> 01:08:38.118
One word, you're a dead man.

01:08:38.286 --> 01:08:40.515
No, man, I'm serious.
Listen, you won't believe this.

01:08:40.688 --> 01:08:41.916
What?

01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:44.285
Two of the hottest chicks
are fighting over you.

01:08:44.459 --> 01:08:47.359
- What are you talking about?
- Sherry is breaking up with Mitch.

01:08:47.528 --> 01:08:49.792
She and Melanie
are having a bidding war over you.

01:08:49.964 --> 01:08:51.295
I don't care.

01:08:51.466 --> 01:08:54.629
Are you nuts?
Sherry dumped Mitch because of you.

01:08:54.801 --> 01:08:56.292
You're my idol.

01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:58.598
As comforting as it was
to be Garrett's idol...

01:08:58.773 --> 01:09:02.265
...it didn't diminish the horror
of being Basketboy number nine.

01:09:02.443 --> 01:09:06.743
And my only hope was that a giant tornado
would destroy the school before the event.

01:09:07.081 --> 01:09:08.776
It was a long shot.

01:09:10.018 --> 01:09:11.883
Welcome, everyone...

01:09:12.053 --> 01:09:15.955
...to this year's
Mayfield Boosters Club Auction.

01:09:16.858 --> 01:09:19.554
Once again we are pleased to present...

01:09:19.727 --> 01:09:23.162
...20 of Mayfield's finest young men...
- Bryce, Bryce, Bryce.

01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:25.560
- What are you doing here?
- Juli's in the third row.

01:09:25.733 --> 01:09:27.997
- So?
- So she's got a wad of cash.

01:09:28.703 --> 01:09:29.727
- Bullshit.
- Bull-true.

01:09:29.904 --> 01:09:31.633
I saw her counting it by her locker.

01:09:31.805 --> 01:09:32.830
And now...

01:09:33.006 --> 01:09:36.340
...please give a big Mayfield School
welcome...

01:09:36.511 --> 01:09:40.810
...to your 1963 Basketboys.

01:09:45.286 --> 01:09:48.278
Juli with cash? What did this mean?

01:09:48.456 --> 01:09:50.685
Was it possible
she was gonna bid on me?

01:09:50.858 --> 01:09:53.019
First up, we have...

01:09:53.194 --> 01:09:55.458
...Raymond Hughes.

01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:57.257
Raymond's on the chess team...

01:09:57.432 --> 01:10:01.698
...and his hobbies include stamp collecting
and the yo-yo.

01:10:01.869 --> 01:10:03.359
Remember, when you bid...

01:10:03.538 --> 01:10:06.598
...you'll not only be getting
the handsome Mr. Hughes...

01:10:07.175 --> 01:10:09.700
...you'll also be enjoying...

01:10:10.078 --> 01:10:12.672
...a lovely chicken-salad sandwich...

01:10:13.114 --> 01:10:17.141
...and what looks to be
a tasty bean dip, and...

01:10:18.086 --> 01:10:20.384
Oh. Excuse me, onion dip.

01:10:20.788 --> 01:10:23.450
And a big slice of cherry pie.

01:10:23.624 --> 01:10:26.491
Okay, who will start the bidding at $5?

01:10:27.929 --> 01:10:30.056
- Thus began the bidding.
- Anybody?

01:10:30.231 --> 01:10:33.462
Or in Raymond Hughes' case,
the lack of bidding.

01:10:34.635 --> 01:10:36.535
Very good, here we go.

01:10:37.538 --> 01:10:39.062
- Five.
- Sold.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.673
- Ten dollars.
- Sold.

01:10:40.842 --> 01:10:42.935
- Fifteen.
- Sold.

01:10:43.678 --> 01:10:45.873
Come on. Do I hear 10?

01:10:46.047 --> 01:10:47.878
- Ten.
- Ten.

01:10:48.049 --> 01:10:51.212
- Ten.
- Peanut-butter-and-banana sandwich.

01:10:51.385 --> 01:10:52.647
Fifteen.

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:55.050
Sold for $15.

01:10:56.758 --> 01:10:59.556
Number eight is Eddie Trulock.

01:11:00.027 --> 01:11:02.325
Eddie is a member of the debate team.

01:11:02.864 --> 01:11:06.732
Now only Eddie Trulock
stood between me and the auction block.

01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:09.799
I wasn't interested in his hobbies
or what was in his basket.

01:11:09.971 --> 01:11:13.236
- Let's start the bidding at $5.
- All I could think of was Juli.

01:11:13.407 --> 01:11:15.773
- Anybody?
- What if she did bid on me?

01:11:16.043 --> 01:11:19.274
What if she got in a bidding war
with Sherry and Melanie and lost out?

01:11:19.447 --> 01:11:20.471
No bidders?

01:11:20.648 --> 01:11:22.912
I was contemplating the horrors
of this when...

01:11:23.084 --> 01:11:24.381
Eight dollars.

01:11:24.819 --> 01:11:28.516
There you go. Eight dollars,
that's more like it. Do I hear 10?

01:11:28.689 --> 01:11:30.657
Juli Baker was bidding on Eddie Trulock?

01:11:30.825 --> 01:11:33.293
- Okay, 8 going once.
- How could she bid on Eddie?

01:11:33.461 --> 01:11:35.952
- Eight going twice.
- How could she bid on anyone?

01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:38.564
Sold to Juli Baker.

01:11:42.603 --> 01:11:46.937
Next is Basketboy number nine,
Bryce Loski.

01:11:47.108 --> 01:11:51.272
I knew I was supposed
to step forward, but I couldn't move.

01:11:51.445 --> 01:11:54.175
Step up, Bryce, don't be shy.

01:11:55.616 --> 01:11:58.210
Better late than never. Ha, ha.

01:11:58.386 --> 01:12:00.411
Bryce likes to play baseball.

01:12:00.588 --> 01:12:02.715
- Five dollars.
- Oh, well, wait until l...

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:04.357
- Ten.
- Oh.

01:12:04.525 --> 01:12:06.425
Well, it appears the bidding is underway.

01:12:06.594 --> 01:12:07.754
- Fifteen.
- Twenty.

01:12:08.196 --> 01:12:09.720
Twenty-five.
Thirty.

01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:11.797
- Thirty-five.
- Forty.

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.998
- Fifty.
- Oh, my.

01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:17.194
Fifty dollars. Wh...

01:12:17.772 --> 01:12:19.000
Fifty going once.

01:12:20.174 --> 01:12:22.404
Fifty going twice.

01:12:22.743 --> 01:12:26.304
Sold to Miss Sherry Stalls for $50.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.005
An all-time record.

01:12:29.317 --> 01:12:33.447
Oh, the boosters will be very grateful
for such a generous donation.

01:12:33.621 --> 01:12:35.111
It's strange.

01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:38.659
Here I was, having lunch
with the hottest girl in school...

01:12:38.826 --> 01:12:40.157
...and I was miserable.

01:12:40.328 --> 01:12:42.922
We're going up to the lake.
My dad has a cabin there...

01:12:43.097 --> 01:12:45.258
...and you get the most outrageous tan.

01:12:45.433 --> 01:12:48.800
Because less than 20 feet
away from me was Juli.

01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:52.064
My Juli with Eddie Trulock.

01:12:52.506 --> 01:12:54.167
She's laughing.

01:12:54.508 --> 01:12:56.203
What was she laughing about?

01:12:56.377 --> 01:13:00.177
How could she sit there and laugh
and look so beautiful?

01:13:01.048 --> 01:13:02.811
Bryce, are you all right?

01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:05.382
What?

01:13:05.553 --> 01:13:06.884
What are you staring at?

01:13:07.855 --> 01:13:09.516
Nothing.

01:13:11.259 --> 01:13:13.489
Lunch is really delicious, Bryce.

01:13:17.732 --> 01:13:18.926
Bryce, did you hear me?

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.466
This is a really delicious lunch.

01:13:22.103 --> 01:13:24.401
Can we not talk about tans or food?

01:13:25.773 --> 01:13:27.866
Well, what do you wanna talk about?

01:13:28.042 --> 01:13:31.910
I don't know, perpetual motion?
Do you know anything about that?

01:13:32.213 --> 01:13:33.544
Perpetual what?

01:13:37.218 --> 01:13:40.745
I don't know what came over me.
It was like I was possessed or something.

01:13:40.922 --> 01:13:44.050
- Juli, I gotta talk to you.
- What?

01:13:46.928 --> 01:13:48.156
What's going on, Bryce?

01:13:51.265 --> 01:13:52.493
What are you doing?

01:13:54.402 --> 01:13:55.994
Bryce, stop it.

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:58.229
Bryce, you didn't even make it to first base.

01:13:58.406 --> 01:13:59.839
I'll kiss you. Ha, ha.

01:14:00.308 --> 01:14:02.936
Juli! Juli!

01:14:04.979 --> 01:14:07.209
Juli, wait. Can we talk?

01:14:07.848 --> 01:14:09.281
Juli!

01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:11.918
- What's the matter with you?
- Leave me alone, Garrett.

01:14:12.086 --> 01:14:16.546
You get a date with the finest girl
on campus and you blow it for Juli.

01:14:16.724 --> 01:14:19.522
- You wouldn't understand!
- I completely don't understand!

01:14:20.628 --> 01:14:22.289
We're talking about Juli Baker here.

01:14:22.463 --> 01:14:25.296
Nightmare neighbor, know-it-all nuisance.
The coop-poop babe.

01:14:25.466 --> 01:14:27.195
Shut up!

01:14:27.368 --> 01:14:29.962
Hey, have you flipped?
What's the matter with you?

01:14:30.137 --> 01:14:34.369
You know what, if you're gonna be like this,
I don't need the association.

01:14:34.542 --> 01:14:37.909
- Well, good, because neither do I.
- Yeah, neither do I!

01:14:40.614 --> 01:14:44.311
As I walked home with the dirty
dishes clanking inside my picnic basket...

01:14:44.485 --> 01:14:46.749
...all I could think of was Juli.

01:14:46.954 --> 01:14:49.650
And I realized Garrett was right

01:14:49.824 --> 01:14:52.884
I had flipped. Completely.

01:15:04.638 --> 01:15:05.662
Hello?

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.968
Oh, heh. Hi, Mrs. Baker. Is Juli there?

01:15:09.143 --> 01:15:13.239
Oh. I'm sorry, Bryce.
Juli doesn't wanna talk.

01:15:18.552 --> 01:15:20.611
Please, Mrs. Baker. I gotta see her.

01:15:20.788 --> 01:15:22.312
I'm sorry, Bryce.

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.784
But I'm afraid she's locked herself
in her room.

01:15:31.832 --> 01:15:34.266
I tried to go to bed early that night...

01:15:34.435 --> 01:15:36.232
...but I couldn't sleep.

01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:39.901
I watched her house from my window
for hours.

01:15:40.074 --> 01:15:43.066
I had to find a way
to show her how I felt.

01:15:45.513 --> 01:15:47.743
Monday morning,
as I made my way into school...

01:15:47.915 --> 01:15:51.009
...I was deciding which
of the Everly Brothers I'd rather marry...

01:15:51.385 --> 01:15:54.115
...when Dana Tressler forced Bryce
back into my brain.

01:15:54.288 --> 01:15:56.381
Juli. The list is out.

01:15:57.158 --> 01:15:59.592
There he is, number nine, your main dish.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.352
Bryce Loski's not my main dish.

01:16:01.529 --> 01:16:05.329
- Oh, you're sticking to your diet.
- It's not a diet, Dana.

01:16:05.499 --> 01:16:08.195
- I'm over him, okay?
- I'm glad to hear it.

01:16:08.369 --> 01:16:11.668
Because rumor has it Sherry's
already staking her claim on him.

01:16:12.039 --> 01:16:14.337
Sherry? Sherry Stalls?

01:16:14.508 --> 01:16:16.806
Oh, Liz. Macy. The list is up.

01:16:20.648 --> 01:16:24.778
That afternoon, I found myself
obsessing about the Basketboy auction.

01:16:25.252 --> 01:16:27.914
I could feel myself backsliding
about Bryce.

01:16:28.089 --> 01:16:30.387
But why should I care if Sherry liked him?

01:16:30.558 --> 01:16:32.549
I shouldn't even be thinking about him.

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.850
I had to rise above this.

01:16:35.029 --> 01:16:37.088
Bryce Loski was no longer in my life.

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:42.701
On the morning of the auction,
I was on edge.

01:16:43.204 --> 01:16:47.368
I found myself, without even knowing
how it happened, staring at my egg money.

01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:49.065
I needed a strategy.

01:16:49.243 --> 01:16:50.608
It was simple.

01:16:50.778 --> 01:16:54.509
If I left my money at home,
I'd leave temptation with it.

01:16:55.049 --> 01:16:58.075
My strategy suffered a setback
when I ran into Mrs. Steuby.

01:16:58.252 --> 01:16:59.651
Julianna.

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:01.412
Julianna.

01:17:01.589 --> 01:17:03.079
Hello, dear.

01:17:04.425 --> 01:17:07.155
I'm so sorry it's taken me so long
to get this to you...

01:17:07.328 --> 01:17:09.626
...but I keep missing you in the morning.

01:17:10.131 --> 01:17:12.463
Mrs. Steuby, I don't want that.
You don't have to...

01:17:12.633 --> 01:17:14.658
Don't be ridiculous. I'm gonna pay you.

01:17:14.835 --> 01:17:17.702
- I'm going to pay you.
- I don't want that. I don't want it.

01:17:17.872 --> 01:17:21.035
Yeah, I want you to go out
and buy yourself something festive.

01:17:21.208 --> 01:17:22.266
Pedal pushers. Ha, ha.

01:17:22.443 --> 01:17:23.774
- Mrs. Steuby.
- Bye, dear.

01:17:23.944 --> 01:17:27.573
- Mrs. Steuby, I don't want pedal pushers.
- No, no. You'll look great.

01:17:30.451 --> 01:17:32.248
It's okay.

01:17:32.419 --> 01:17:35.582
It's okay. No big deal.
Just pretend like I don't have it.

01:17:36.190 --> 01:17:38.317
I hear you're planning to bid on Bryce.

01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:40.255
What? Who told you that? No, I'm not.

01:17:40.427 --> 01:17:42.657
Someone saw you with a wad of cash
this morning.

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:45.424
- How much do you have?
- It's none of your business.

01:17:45.599 --> 01:17:48.500
And I'm not bidding, okay?
I don't even like him anymore.

01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:50.330
Oh, that'll be the day.

01:17:50.504 --> 01:17:54.099
It's true. Go ahead,
waste your money on him. I don't care.

01:17:54.475 --> 01:17:59.310
And now, will you all give
a big Mayfield School welcome...

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:03.610
...to your 1963 Basketboys.

01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:06.219
I could say I didn't care all I wanted...

01:18:06.387 --> 01:18:09.083
...but seeing Bryce walk out
in his jacket and tie...

01:18:09.256 --> 01:18:11.087
...holding that picnic basket...

01:18:11.258 --> 01:18:13.522
...set my head spinning again.

01:18:14.061 --> 01:18:15.926
Fifteen going once.

01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:19.991
- The auction seemed to fly by.
- Fifteen going twice.

01:18:20.167 --> 01:18:23.159
Sold to Macy Taylor for $15.

01:18:24.338 --> 01:18:26.829
Before I knew it,
Eddie Trulock was called.

01:18:27.341 --> 01:18:30.174
Number eight is Eddie Trulock.

01:18:30.678 --> 01:18:32.009
Which meant Bryce was next.

01:18:32.179 --> 01:18:34.477
Eddie is a member of the debate team.

01:18:34.648 --> 01:18:37.845
And his hobbies include fishing...

01:18:38.018 --> 01:18:41.181
...and model-airplane building.

01:18:41.355 --> 01:18:43.448
Who will give me $5?

01:18:46.427 --> 01:18:49.919
- Why isn't anyone bidding? He's so nice.
- Exactly.

01:18:50.831 --> 01:18:52.321
Nobody?

01:18:54.868 --> 01:18:56.199
Eight dollars.

01:18:56.370 --> 01:18:59.237
Sold to Juli Baker for $8.

01:18:59.406 --> 01:19:01.306
How did this happen?

01:19:01.475 --> 01:19:03.636
Was it because I felt bad for Eddie?

01:19:03.811 --> 01:19:06.507
Or was it because I couldn't trust myself
with Bryce?

01:19:07.314 --> 01:19:09.544
As I made my way
to the multi-purpose room...

01:19:09.717 --> 01:19:12.481
...I contemplated
the startling turn of events.

01:19:12.653 --> 01:19:15.349
Here I was, about to have lunch
with Eddie Trulock...

01:19:15.522 --> 01:19:17.786
...while the boy I mooned over
for half my life...

01:19:17.958 --> 01:19:20.324
...was going to share a meal
with my mortal enemy.

01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:25.191
I wanna thank you for bidding on me.

01:19:25.366 --> 01:19:27.334
It was touch-and-go there for a while.

01:19:27.668 --> 01:19:30.398
No, I wanted to. This will be fun.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.274
- I hear you like building model airplanes.
- Yeah.

01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:46.317
My father and I just finished
a Russian MiG-19. It was made in 1955.

01:19:46.487 --> 01:19:49.945
MiG's first supersonic fighter.
Tricky because the cockpit was recessed...

01:19:50.124 --> 01:19:52.024
I tried to give Eddie my full attention.

01:19:52.192 --> 01:19:55.320
But it was difficult,
because Bryce was right behind him.

01:19:55.496 --> 01:19:57.760
Eddie was saying something
about intake valves...

01:19:57.931 --> 01:20:01.924
...when out of nowhere, Bryce stood up
and marched straight towards me.

01:20:02.636 --> 01:20:04.831
Hey, Juli, I gotta talk to you.

01:20:12.012 --> 01:20:13.639
What are you doing?

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:19.485
He was going to kiss me. To kiss me.

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.252
All my life I've been waiting for that kiss.

01:20:22.556 --> 01:20:25.650
But not like this. Not this way.

01:20:26.593 --> 01:20:29.960
I pedaled home so hard,
I thought my lungs would burst.

01:20:35.069 --> 01:20:36.764
Julianna?

01:20:39.239 --> 01:20:40.831
Julianna.

01:20:43.877 --> 01:20:45.435
Honey?

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.172
What's wrong?

01:20:48.816 --> 01:20:50.443
I can't.

01:20:54.054 --> 01:20:55.885
Sweetheart...

01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:58.514
...you can tell me.

01:21:00.728 --> 01:21:02.821
Bryce tried to kiss me.

01:21:04.064 --> 01:21:05.531
He did?

01:21:05.866 --> 01:21:07.197
In school.

01:21:08.302 --> 01:21:10.031
In front of everybody.

01:21:11.872 --> 01:21:13.169
Mom, please don't get it.

01:21:13.874 --> 01:21:15.637
It's probably him.

01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:19.008
Sweetheart...

01:21:19.179 --> 01:21:20.976
...maybe you should talk to him.

01:21:22.783 --> 01:21:24.341
I can't.

01:21:24.852 --> 01:21:26.479
I can't.

01:21:28.288 --> 01:21:30.483
Bryce wouldn't leave me alone.

01:21:31.692 --> 01:21:33.683
He kept calling on the phone.

01:21:35.929 --> 01:21:37.863
And knocking on the door.

01:21:38.732 --> 01:21:41.496
He even snuck around the house
and tapped on my window.

01:21:42.002 --> 01:21:43.993
Juli! Please, I gotta see you!

01:21:44.171 --> 01:21:45.638
Come on out, just for a minute!

01:21:45.806 --> 01:21:49.003
Why didn't he understand
that I just wanted to be left alone?

01:21:49.176 --> 01:21:50.700
Please!

01:21:53.247 --> 01:21:55.681
After two days, Bryce stopped.

01:21:55.849 --> 01:21:58.079
And I thought it was finally over.

01:22:01.555 --> 01:22:05.116
Then, one afternoon,
I was coming into the front room to read...

01:22:07.728 --> 01:22:09.662
...when I heard a noise in the yard.

01:22:14.334 --> 01:22:15.631
Hey, what's he doing?

01:22:15.803 --> 01:22:19.739
Juli, calm down. I gave him permission.

01:22:19.907 --> 01:22:23.570
Permission? Permission for what?
He's digging a hole.

01:22:23.877 --> 01:22:25.367
I told him he could.

01:22:25.946 --> 01:22:27.470
But why?

01:22:27.648 --> 01:22:29.411
I told him he could.

01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:32.717
It was torture seeing him
dig up my grass.

01:22:32.886 --> 01:22:35.286
How could my father let him do this?

01:22:35.622 --> 01:22:37.954
Bryce knew I was there too.

01:22:46.099 --> 01:22:47.657
He's gone.

01:22:58.045 --> 01:22:59.444
A tree?

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:02.045
He's planting a tree?

01:23:07.855 --> 01:23:09.117
Is it a?

01:23:09.289 --> 01:23:11.450
I didn't really need to ask.

01:23:11.625 --> 01:23:13.957
I could tell
from the shape of the leaves...

01:23:14.127 --> 01:23:16.152
...and the texture of the trunk.

01:23:16.597 --> 01:23:18.656
It was a sycamore tree.

01:23:24.137 --> 01:23:29.040
When she walked out of the door,
I thought back to the first time I saw her.

01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:33.737
How could anybody, ever,
have wanted to run away from Juli Baker?

01:23:34.114 --> 01:23:36.207
He looked at me with those eyes.

01:23:36.383 --> 01:23:38.613
Those once again dazzling eyes.

01:23:38.785 --> 01:23:43.313
And I knew that Bryce Loski
was still walking around with my first kiss.

01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:45.917
But he wouldn't be for long.

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:50.261
As we stood there,
I realized that all these years...

01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:52.455
...we never really talked.

01:23:55.836 --> 01:23:57.098
Do you need some help?

01:23:58.038 --> 01:23:59.198
Yeah.

01:24:00.807 --> 01:24:02.934
But that day, we started.

01:24:04.344 --> 01:24:07.108
And I knew we'd be talking for a long time.

01:29:53.577 --> 01:29:55.477
Let's do it from the beginning again.

01:29:55.646 --> 01:29:57.204
You ready? And action.

01:29:57.381 --> 01:29:58.678
Juli, can we talk?

01:29:58.849 --> 01:30:00.373
- What's going on?
- And...

01:30:01.785 --> 01:30:03.252
Oh, God.

01:30:03.453 --> 01:30:05.444
Oh, God, here we go.

01:30:06.356 --> 01:30:08.881
The scene where we're doing
the Basketboy thing...

01:30:09.059 --> 01:30:12.495
...where we almost kiss,
that one was so hard.

01:30:12.663 --> 01:30:14.096
Bryce, what are you doing?

01:30:14.264 --> 01:30:15.925
Mm...

01:30:16.099 --> 01:30:17.896
Stop it. Ha, ha!

01:30:18.068 --> 01:30:19.592
And then I leave? Ha, ha.

01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:20.794
God.

01:30:20.971 --> 01:30:24.065
You gotta be serious about this.
You can't be giggling during this.

01:30:24.241 --> 01:30:26.436
- Okay. Okay.
- Sorry.

01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:27.804
Can't be Giggleville.

01:30:27.978 --> 01:30:29.843
- Serious.
- Let's do it again. No giggling.

01:30:30.013 --> 01:30:31.571
It's supposed to be we're talking...

01:30:31.782 --> 01:30:33.613
...and he comes up and tries to kiss me.

01:30:33.784 --> 01:30:36.651
It was really hard. I had to wait

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:38.082
Oh, it was so embarrassing.

01:30:38.355 --> 01:30:39.549
And action.

01:30:41.792 --> 01:30:43.191
Juli, I gotta talk to you.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.588
We don't actually kiss.

01:30:44.761 --> 01:30:47.889
It's a near kiss.
I try to kiss her and then she runs out.

01:30:48.065 --> 01:30:49.657
I was kind of confused when I read that.

01:30:49.833 --> 01:30:53.929
Because she wanted the kiss
the entire time, then when I try she runs.

01:30:54.104 --> 01:30:56.402
He gets up and, like, walks towards me...

01:30:56.573 --> 01:31:00.634
...and says, "Can I talk to you?"

01:31:00.844 --> 01:31:02.368
And then I have to run away.

01:31:02.546 --> 01:31:03.808
But we kept laughing.

01:31:06.116 --> 01:31:07.640
I tripped on the cloth.

01:31:07.818 --> 01:31:10.810
It was so funny. Oh, my gosh.
It was so hard to keep a straight face.

01:31:11.254 --> 01:31:12.278
It was so embarrassing.

01:31:12.556 --> 01:31:14.319
Just turn around.

01:31:14.491 --> 01:31:15.515
That was so weird.

01:31:15.692 --> 01:31:19.093
I thought the sniffing hair was weird,
when I had to sniff his hair in one scene...

01:31:19.262 --> 01:31:20.490
...but that was really weird.

01:31:20.664 --> 01:31:23.428
That was really fun to film
but it was really awkward as well.

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.898
Then Madeline was trying to not laugh.

01:31:26.536 --> 01:31:29.004
- Why are you smiling?
- Cut.

01:31:29.172 --> 01:31:31.538
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. Ha, ha.

01:31:31.708 --> 01:31:33.335
It was so hard not to laugh.

01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:36.172
I had to have Callan... He was off camera.
I'm like, "Turn around!"

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.141
What are you doing?

01:31:39.316 --> 01:31:40.340
Stop.

01:31:40.517 --> 01:31:41.950
- Ha, ha.
- And cut.

01:31:42.119 --> 01:31:44.212
One of the kids,
who played Eddie Trulock...

01:31:44.388 --> 01:31:47.323
...who ended up being chosen by Juli
at the Basketboy thing...

01:31:47.491 --> 01:31:51.860
...he told Madeline and I that my look

01:31:52.329 --> 01:31:54.126
Show him your face.

01:31:56.299 --> 01:31:59.359
You see... coming towards you
and you're supposed to be serious.

01:31:59.536 --> 01:32:01.299
- It's too funny.
- Okay, picture's up.

01:32:01.471 --> 01:32:04.702
I had to run out after and I'd
stay there for a bit after she'd run away.

01:32:04.875 --> 01:32:07.503
And we had all the really nice
extra kids over there...

01:32:07.677 --> 01:32:10.145
...and they were saying, like,
"Ooh. Bryce. Bryce."

01:32:10.447 --> 01:32:11.709
Bryce, stop.

01:32:11.882 --> 01:32:13.679
Bryce, you didn't even make it
to first base.

01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:15.044
Hey, Bryce, I'll kiss you.

01:32:15.218 --> 01:32:18.551
Nice job, make-out artist.
Hello, lover boy.

01:32:18.722 --> 01:32:19.814
And cut. Good.

01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:22.424
Okay. Good. Very good, Cal.

01:32:22.592 --> 01:32:25.561
Sometimes Rob will yell a direction,
like, "Try it like that!"

01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:26.923
Because he's in the other room.

01:32:27.097 --> 01:32:29.622
I was like, "We're not gonna kiss, right?
We're not, right?"

01:32:31.802 --> 01:32:35.203
"Okay, Callan, this time
I want you to actually kiss her."

01:32:35.372 --> 01:32:36.896
- Cal?
- Yes?

01:32:37.074 --> 01:32:39.042
On this time,
I want you to really kiss her.

01:32:39.209 --> 01:32:40.574
- No, I'm kidding.
- He's kidding.

01:32:40.744 --> 01:32:41.733
- Ha, ha!
- What?

01:32:41.912 --> 01:32:43.903
My face drained.

01:32:44.781 --> 01:32:47.113
And I looked at Callan. I'm like, "What?"

01:32:47.284 --> 01:32:49.218
It was so funny.
They got me really good.

01:32:49.386 --> 01:32:52.549
- Oh, my gosh. That was scary.
- Ha, ha.

01:32:52.722 --> 01:32:54.986
- Good one, Rob.
- Who put you up to that?

01:32:55.158 --> 01:32:57.592
But the sad thing was,
my mom and dad put him up to it.

01:32:58.028 --> 01:33:00.553
Oh, gosh. That was so embarrassing.
