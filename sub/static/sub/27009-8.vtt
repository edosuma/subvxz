I'm on the outside, and I can see
that it's not getting better.

21:30.498 --> 21:31.916
It's actually getting worse.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.418
You don't have to put on this brave face.

21:34.502 --> 21:37.588
Brave Face? You know Moon Wolf Brave Face?

21:37.671 --> 21:39.048
Is he gunning for this gig too?

21:39.548 --> 21:40.966
I got to call Irv back.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.011
Nguyen-Nguyen, you're not living
in a rice paddy anymore.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.639
This is America in the 20th century.

21:46.722 --> 21:50.476
There are things abused wives
can do to help themselves.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.312
Talk to a priest, find a friendly fireman,

21:53.395 --> 21:54.772
watch Phil Donahue.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.690
Sue, I know what I'm doing.

21:56.774 --> 21:57.983
No, you don't!

21:58.818 --> 21:59.819
Sue, this is where I work.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.404
-Please don't cause a scene.
-Everything okay, Frank?

22:02.488 --> 22:05.074
I hope we didn't offend Sue
talking about our sex art.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.659
Leave Frank alone, you idiots.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.911
Can I freshen up your malt liquor, Rosie?

22:08.994 --> 22:10.621
Nothing to see here. It's personal.

22:10.704 --> 22:11.664
What is?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.375
Forget it, Chet. It's nothing.

22:14.917 --> 22:18.254
Looks to me like Sue's trying to put
some crazy ideas in my wife's head.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.047
Yeah, I'm the crazy one.

22:20.631 --> 22:23.217
I see you, Chet, for exactly who you are.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.344
An angry, sad man,

22:25.427 --> 22:28.430
who has to bully his wife around
to make him feel big and strong.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.684
Who had to burn down her village
just to take her as his wife.

22:31.767 --> 22:34.186
Technically, village was already burning.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.146
What kind of healthy marriage
is that, Chet?

22:36.230 --> 22:38.023
Is she your wife or your slave?

22:38.107 --> 22:41.151
I've always thought
slavery was wrong, Rosie,

22:41.235 --> 22:43.696
but I would have paid top dollar for you.

22:43.779 --> 22:44.864
[both] Shut up, Bob!

22:45.739 --> 22:46.782
Listen, Chet.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.285
I don't want anymore trouble with you.

22:49.660 --> 22:53.497
Let's just call a cease fire
and steer clear of each other. Okay?

22:53.581 --> 22:57.334
Frank, I don't know what I ever did to
make you feel this way about me, but sure.

22:57.918 --> 23:01.046
It'll be a little difficult
to steer clear of each other, though,

23:01.130 --> 23:04.842
because, well, Brandy's hiring me
to take over your pilot training program.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.302
You're gonna be working here?

23:06.385 --> 23:07.678
Isn't that great?

23:07.761 --> 23:10.723
I'm gonna see you
around the neighborhood and the airport.

23:11.098 --> 23:14.810
And if you ever get over
your crazy obsession with me,

23:15.311 --> 23:17.062
we can even carpool.

23:17.521 --> 23:20.232
I promise... I won't look at you.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.484
Enjoy the party, Frank.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.403
Always a pleasure, Sue.

23:25.446 --> 23:26.322
Dumpling.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.746

<i>Therefore, be at peace with God</i>

23:34.371 --> 23:36.332
<i>Whatever you conceive him to be</i>

23:37.082 --> 23:41.670
<i>And whatever your labors and aspirations</i>
<i>In the noisy confusion of life</i>

23:42.421 --> 23:44.089
<i>Keep peace with your soul</i>

23:44.798 --> 23:47.426
<i>But do not distress yourself</i>
<i>With imaginings</i>

23:47.509 --> 23:50.346
<i>Many fears are born</i>
<i>Of fatigue and loneliness</i>

23:50.429 --> 23:51.388
You got an I.D.?

23:51.764 --> 23:53.891
No. I have an idea.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.851
It's called free beer! [laughs]

23:55.935 --> 23:56.852
Ah!

23:56.936 --> 23:59.229
<i>With all its drudgery and broken dreams</i>

23:59.313 --> 24:01.982

24:22.878 --> 24:26.590
<i>Well, I am just enjoying a nice bowl</i>

24:26.674 --> 24:30.260

24:30.344 --> 24:32.471

24:35.140 --> 24:37.142
<i>Man, I am so blessed.</i>

24:37.226 --> 24:39.979

24:40.062 --> 24:43.649
<i>that just gets you so blessed with</i>
<i>these kinds of situations all the time?"</i>

24:44.149 --> 24:47.027
<i>Anyway, I did notice something</i>
<i>at the party tonight.</i>

24:47.528 --> 24:49.279
<i>You know, Sue seemed a little tense.</i>

24:49.363 --> 24:50.781
<i>Kind of wound too tight.</i>

24:50.864 --> 24:53.075
<i>Now, I am certainly not a doctor,</i>

24:53.617 --> 24:57.162
<i>but I think she's got</i>
<i>a bad case of the hornies.</i>

24:57.246 --> 24:58.664
That son of a bitch!

24:58.747 --> 25:01.250
[Chet]<i> The cure for that is real simple.</i>
<i>What you need to do--</i>

25:02.459 --> 25:03.919
[Robotic voice]<i> Second message.</i>

25:04.003 --> 25:05.921
[Chet]<i> It's me again.</i>
<i>The machine cut me off.</i>

25:06.005 --> 25:10.801
<i>Anyway, you need to get her</i>
<i>on her tummy and show her who's boss.</i>

25:10.884 --> 25:13.554
<i>Next time she starts</i>
<i>all her nonsense yapping,</i>

25:13.637 --> 25:17.182

25:17.266 --> 25:19.560
<i>ready for action.</i>
<i>Take that mean right out of her.</i>

25:19.643 --> 25:22.062
He is a fucking dead man!

25:22.146 --> 25:26.025
[Chet]<i> Anyway, you want to drive to work</i>

25:26.108 --> 25:27.735
-[beep]
-[screams]

25:29.903 --> 25:31.196
I'm gonna kill him.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.449
I'm gonna beat that smirk
right off his fucking face.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.408
Frank.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.243
Sue, do not try to stop me.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.954
I'm not gonna stop you,
I'm gonna join you.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.165
How many slices do you want?

25:46.128 --> 25:47.004
I didn't do anything!

25:50.424 --> 25:51.550
They're at Chet's house.

25:51.633 --> 25:52.801
Nguyen-Nguyen!

25:54.011 --> 25:55.929
[gasps] What has he done to her?

25:56.013 --> 25:57.556
I think he's dying on her.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.892
[retching and coughing]

26:02.853 --> 26:04.313
-Holy shit!
-What happened?

26:04.396 --> 26:06.023
The wife was poisoning his noodles.

26:06.106 --> 26:06.982
[all] What?

26:07.066 --> 26:09.401
Threw up two gallons of floor cleanser.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.987
Poor bastard smells
like he just blew Mr. Clean.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.240
I innocent. No talk English good.

26:16.909 --> 26:20.120
I was changing Chet
a little bit at a time,

26:20.454 --> 26:24.958
but tonight I got tired of waiting
and poured in the whole bottle.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.796
I told you, Sue. I'm a survivor.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.923
I... I...

26:32.049 --> 26:33.342
Book me, Danno.
