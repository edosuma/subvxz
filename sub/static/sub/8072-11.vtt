[theme music]

00:07.675 --> 00:09.077
[bangs vacuum]

00:09.110 --> 00:10.544
Can I help?

00:10.578 --> 00:12.646
Uh, it's kind of
a one man job, Deej.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.182
I thought you were
playing video games.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.917
I was, but I can't
move my fingers anymore.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.556
I've got a tongue twister.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.525
OK, pal, let's hear it.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.295
Six sick sheep--

00:27.328 --> 00:28.396
no, wait.

00:28.429 --> 00:31.832
Six sick sheik sheep--
no, wait.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.501
Six sick sheep--

00:33.534 --> 00:34.402
Hey, Deej!

00:34.435 --> 00:37.271
Why don't you call a friend?

00:37.305 --> 00:39.440
I don't have any friends.

00:39.473 --> 00:42.110
Well, let's talk about this.

00:42.143 --> 00:45.079
What happened to the friends you
made playing soccer last year?

00:45.113 --> 00:49.583
They wanted to shave my head
and paint it black and white.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.685
Well, why don't we
pick another sport?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.387
Go get the catalog from
the Parks Department.

00:53.421 --> 00:56.657
Let's pick something
we can both play.

00:56.690 --> 01:00.228
Six sick sheep, six sheep sick.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.129
Hey!

01:01.162 --> 01:02.763
How about hockey?

01:02.796 --> 01:03.664
Oh, hockey?

01:03.697 --> 01:05.766
It's, uh, it's cold, it's wet.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.435
There's all that skating.

01:07.468 --> 01:10.671
You can skate, can't you?

01:10.704 --> 01:11.805
How about wrestling?

01:11.839 --> 01:13.707
You know, the old
man was almost a state

01:13.741 --> 01:15.509
champ back in high school.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.877
Were you ever in a cage match?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.647
Only with your mom.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.149
How about, uh, weight training?

01:21.182 --> 01:22.950
What's that?

01:22.983 --> 01:24.752
That's where you lift weights.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.788
Then what?

01:27.821 --> 01:32.092
Then you put them
back down again.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.462
How about, uh, basketball?
- Mm.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.729
Bowling?

01:35.763 --> 01:36.897
Boxing?

01:36.930 --> 01:37.931
Handball?

01:37.965 --> 01:39.367
Shotput?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.402
[sighs] What else they got?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.471
Hey, here's something cool!

01:43.504 --> 01:46.106
Tap dancing!

01:46.140 --> 01:48.576
Hockey it is!

01:48.609 --> 01:52.513
[theme music]

02:30.484 --> 02:32.453
[roseanne laughs]

02:32.486 --> 02:35.856
[music playing]

02:41.061 --> 02:42.062
Have you seen DJ?

02:42.095 --> 02:43.231
He wanted me to
drive him, and I'm

02:43.264 --> 02:44.598
going to be late for school.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.033
Oh, he's still
over at the, uh,

02:46.066 --> 02:49.036
skating rink learning how to
play hockey with your dad.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.305
[scoffs] DJ's
going to play hockey?

02:51.339 --> 02:54.608
He can't even walk on land.

02:54.642 --> 02:58.246
Oh, Darlene, try to be a
little more positive about it.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.113
Think about all the
cute things we'll

03:00.147 --> 03:03.284
be able to write on his cast.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.184
Yeah, you're right.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.686
Hockey could be his sport.

03:05.719 --> 03:09.089
He's used to being chased
by people with sticks.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.524
DAN: Yo!

03:10.558 --> 03:11.825
We need a medic in here.

03:11.859 --> 03:12.960
Oh, my god!

03:12.993 --> 03:15.162
DJ!

03:15.195 --> 03:16.664
Dan, what happened?

03:16.697 --> 03:17.498
Nothing.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.071
I had a little trouble
coming out of my triple lutz

03:24.104 --> 03:26.907
when I tried to grab my
skate behind my head.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.310
Mom, I'm going to be a
professional hockey player.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.378
Great!

03:30.411 --> 03:33.547
We'll save all that
money on toothpaste.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.383
Go head up and
change your clothes.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.317
He shoots, he scores!

03:36.350 --> 03:37.651
He shoots--

03:37.685 --> 03:39.853
Man, I don't think there's
an inch of that rink my butt

03:39.887 --> 03:41.889
didn't get to know intimately.

03:41.922 --> 03:42.790
OK.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.824
Well, we know you suck.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.493
How about DJ?

03:45.526 --> 03:46.927
Well, you know how
when they choose sides

03:46.960 --> 03:49.363
and some guy always
gets picked last?

03:49.397 --> 03:51.965
DJ would be right behind him.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.401
Can he at least skate?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.935
Yeah, he can skate.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.305
He just can't stop.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.507
Honey, I'm really hurting here.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.542
Can you give me the
pillow and a heating pad?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.611
Yeah, sure.

04:03.644 --> 04:07.448
Boy, you had to do that big,
macho hockey stuff, huh?

04:07.481 --> 04:10.451
Couldn't take a
little tap dancing.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.419
Dad.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.420
Huh?

04:12.453 --> 04:14.121
Tryouts are tomorrow
morning at 5:00.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.056
I want to practice some before.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.491
So can we get there
an hour early.

04:17.525 --> 04:18.392
Sure.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.828
[whimpers]

04:20.861 --> 04:22.296
[knocking at door]

04:22.330 --> 04:26.367
Come in!
- Hey, Dan.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.401
Roseanne around?

04:27.435 --> 04:30.971
I brought over some
new menu designs.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.005
Are you all right?

04:32.039 --> 04:34.708
Yeah, uh, DJ's
into hockey now,

04:34.742 --> 04:37.545
and I was just trying to
teach him how to take a fall.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.013
He's a slow learner.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.081
You're kidding.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.584
I was All Peewee
two years in a row.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.985
I probably got some
stuff that'll fit him.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.120
Hey, maybe I could even
show him a few moves.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.255
Great!

04:48.288 --> 04:51.191
He's got a tryout
tomorrow morning at 5:00.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.726
Gee, maybe I shouldn't.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.596
Sounds like a father,
son kind of thing.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.730
Hey, Fisher.

04:56.764 --> 04:57.798
Hey, Roseanne.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.066
Well, I got to go.
So just give me a call.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.401
Let me know which one
of these you like.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.302
- OK.
- Better keep Dan on his feet.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.737
Well, that
shouldn't be too hard.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.205
I'll just strap a
pair of skates on him.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.743
Hit the bull's eye, Mommy.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.580
[roseanne laughs sarcastically]

05:12.613 --> 05:13.514
Come back.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.416
Whoa!

05:15.449 --> 05:18.218
Oh, you know, my body used
to be able to take a hit.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.787
I could play four
quarters of football,

05:19.820 --> 05:21.655
still go out and party at night.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.824
Well, I hate to be the one
to break this to you, Dan,

05:23.857 --> 05:27.395
but it's not like you've got the
body of some Greek god anymore.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.263
Now it's more like you've
got the body of, you know,

05:30.297 --> 05:33.166
some Greek guy.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.037
[music playing]

05:40.073 --> 05:41.041
Wow.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.976
These menus are great.

05:43.010 --> 05:43.977
Yeah.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.647
Fisher says he
normally charges $200.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.948
What's he going to charge us?

05:47.981 --> 05:50.418
Well, I told him he
could marry Jackie,

05:50.451 --> 05:52.786
and then we'd make
up the difference.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.522
You know, I tried to get
a hold of her last night.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.523
Have you seen her?

05:55.556 --> 05:56.924
No.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.159
She was supposed to come over to
my house for dinner last night,

05:59.192 --> 06:00.494
but you know how
some people are.

06:00.528 --> 06:03.831
They totally forget their
family when a man gets involved.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.233
Something came up, OK?

06:06.266 --> 06:09.903
Oh, something came up.
(SARCASTICALLY) Excuse me.

06:09.937 --> 06:13.407
Oh, sure is fun
working with sisters.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.909
Sorry, Roseanne,
Fisher and I needed

06:15.943 --> 06:17.811
to resolve some problems
in our relationship,

06:17.845 --> 06:20.147
and then we broke up.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.281
Oh, you're kidding, right?

06:21.314 --> 06:22.483
No.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.317
[gasps] That pig!

06:24.351 --> 06:25.586
How could he dump you?

06:25.619 --> 06:26.954
- Roseanne.
- No.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.656
This is going to turn out
to be the very best thing

06:28.689 --> 06:29.657
that's ever happened to you.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.558
Trust me.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.025
Fisher has got nothing goin'.

06:32.059 --> 06:32.926
He's just a kid.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.962
He's got nothing
going on at all.

06:34.995 --> 06:35.963
He didn't break up with me.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.631
I broke up with him.

06:37.665 --> 06:38.799
Are you out of your mind?

06:38.832 --> 06:39.700
Why would you do that?

06:39.733 --> 06:42.302
He's the perfect guy for you!

06:42.335 --> 06:44.371
It was inevitable, Roseanne.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.273
We went to the
Lobo last weekend.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.374
And I went into the bathroom.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.709
I came out.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.111
And he was talking to this
woman who was like his own age.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.379
He's flirting.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.447
OK.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.883
So you cut him off
for a couple of weeks.

06:55.916 --> 06:56.784
No.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.186
He wasn't flirting, Roseanne.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.187
They were just talking.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.354
And then it hit me--

07:01.388 --> 07:02.856
they looked really
right together,

07:02.890 --> 07:04.424
and he and I are never
going to look that way.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.827
Oh, you guys look
really great together.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.761
You're so cute.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.096
I swear it makes
me want to wretch.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.764
Honest.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.366
It's so obvious, and
it's only a matter of time

07:13.400 --> 07:16.169
before he sees it too and
dumps me for a younger woman.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.472
So I dumped him before
he could dump me.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.908
See, if you're going to go
disqualify everyone that's

07:20.941 --> 07:22.876
going to dump you, you're
never going to go out on a date

07:22.910 --> 07:25.178
again.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.914
I have had enough
therapy to know

07:26.947 --> 07:28.749
when I'm in a
self-destructive relationship.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.051
And since I can't
break up with you,

07:31.084 --> 07:32.886
then I'm going to
deal with this one.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.787
Hey!

07:33.821 --> 07:35.422
You're not even listening to me.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.690
No, you're not
listening to me.

07:36.724 --> 07:39.126
If you can't support
me, then stay out of it.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.127
Oh, that is so unfair.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.529
You know I can't stay out of it.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.601
I'll support your mistake.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.737
Thank you.

07:49.770 --> 07:53.106
[knocking at door]

07:53.140 --> 07:54.074
I made the team!

07:54.107 --> 07:55.042
I'm an Otter!

07:55.075 --> 07:56.009
I'm a Fighting Otter!

07:56.043 --> 07:57.244
All right, DJ!

07:57.277 --> 07:59.580
Well, how about a sandwich
for the newest Otter?

07:59.613 --> 08:01.081
You go wash up, and
I'll make you one.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.216
Yeah, the Conner
Dynasty continues.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.987
I knew he had to have some
of the old man in him.

08:07.020 --> 08:07.888
What?

08:07.921 --> 08:09.156
Did they take everybody?

08:09.189 --> 08:10.123
Just the ones that showed up.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.595
Is he gonna get to play?

08:14.628 --> 08:15.896
Only if he brings
a deck of cards.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.834
It's a lost cause.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.703
It's too bad Fisher had to
get up at 4:00 in the morning

08:22.736 --> 08:23.871
to coach him.

08:23.904 --> 08:24.838
Fisher?

08:24.872 --> 08:27.107
What was Fisher--
no, never mind.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.008
I don't care.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.442
I don't want to know.

08:29.476 --> 08:33.246
I'm going to go get
some cheese for DJ.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.216
[drums lips]

08:36.249 --> 08:38.185
What was that all about?

08:38.218 --> 08:40.020
OK.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.456
Under the category, failed
relationships for 200,

08:43.490 --> 08:44.925
the answer is--

08:44.958 --> 08:47.494
Jackie and Fischer.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.964
(WHINING) Roseanne, no.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.900
I can't go through
a breakup right now.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.568
It's a bad time with DJ and all.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.072
Well, this time it's
going to be different.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.073
No, it won't!

09:00.107 --> 09:01.274
It'll be the same
as all the others.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.876
She's going to fall apart,
and then we have to put

09:02.910 --> 09:04.745
the pieces back together.

09:04.778 --> 09:09.049
How could he dump her right now
when I'm at my most vulnerable?

09:09.082 --> 09:11.985
Brace yourself,
Dan, she dumped him.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.187
She dumped him?

09:14.221 --> 09:15.522
Wow.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.057
He didn't say anything about
it at practice this morning.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.325
Well, that's
because he's a man.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.426
You know, he
probably didn't want

09:19.459 --> 09:21.528
to ruin some precious
hockey moment

09:21.561 --> 09:24.632
with some stupid
outpouring of emotion.

09:24.665 --> 09:29.236
Here we go, DJ,
my little Otter.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.672
Fighting Otter.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.441
Fierce Fighting Otter.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.309
So how is hockey going?

09:36.343 --> 09:37.210
Great.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.345
Uh-huh.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.513
And how is that coach of
yours, you know, Fisher?

09:40.547 --> 09:41.414
He's cool.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.549
Oh, great.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.516
Did he mention me?

09:43.550 --> 09:44.417
Yeah.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.886
What'd he say?

09:45.919 --> 09:49.156
He said you guys went
to a hockey game once.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.358
How did he say it?
Did he seem depressed?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.731
Has he lost any weight?

09:57.765 --> 09:58.766
Is he seeing someone else?

09:58.799 --> 10:00.000
Talk to me, DJ.

10:00.033 --> 10:00.834
Mom!

10:04.437 --> 10:08.308
[music playing]

10:16.750 --> 10:18.151
OK.
Here's the pizza.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.087
How's Jackie?
- She's calmed down a lot.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.189
Now, she's just hysterical.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.891
Darlene, I need ice cream.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.125
What about the pizza?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.695
No, she's right past
the chewy, manic phase

10:27.728 --> 10:30.097
into the ice cream depression.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.298
Oh, man.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.166
How much longer is
this going to last?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.567
ROSEANNE: Who knows?

10:34.601 --> 10:36.369
This may sound
medieval, but there

10:36.403 --> 10:39.873
are still working convents.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.341
I can't believe you people.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.710
She's always going
to be there for us,

10:42.743 --> 10:45.478
and we are going to be there
for her for as long as it takes.

10:45.512 --> 10:48.515
Or until I can figure out how
to get her the hell out of here.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.722
Here you go, honey, your
favorite, chocolate chocolate

10:54.755 --> 10:56.023
chip.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.624
How you doing?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.993
[scoffs] Fisher
liked ice cream.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.866
Well, that's a rare
trait to find in a man,

11:05.899 --> 11:07.868
but there will be other guys.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.837
I'm 37.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.272
I'm 37 years old.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.008
I had my first real
date when I was 15.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.676
That's 22 years worth of dating.

11:16.710 --> 11:20.180
You'd think that in 22 years
Mr. Right would have shown up.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.949
Well, he probably did,
but you were out on a date

11:21.982 --> 11:22.783
with some reject.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.155
Maybe it's just a bad idea.

11:28.188 --> 11:28.989
I'm gonna call Fisher.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.863
What are you doing?

11:35.896 --> 11:37.998
Why aren't you stopping me?

11:38.031 --> 11:41.268
It's a local call.

11:41.301 --> 11:45.338
No matter what I do, you
can't let me call Fisher!

11:45.372 --> 11:47.607
You're supposed
to be my support!

11:47.640 --> 11:51.478
If Fisher was here, he'd never
let me pick up that phone.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.346
Well, gee, let's give
him a call and find out.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.582
No.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.616
Well, come on.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.018
I want to hear his side of it.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.887
What did he say when
you broke up with him?

11:59.920 --> 12:00.788
Nothing much.

12:00.821 --> 12:01.721
I did all the talking.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.190
I just told him it
was too intense.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.158
He was bringing me
flowers all the time.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.159
He was calling me constantly.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.527
It was, I love you!

12:07.560 --> 12:08.428
I love you!

12:08.461 --> 12:09.629
I love you!

12:09.662 --> 12:10.463
That bastard.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.702
What else did you tell him?

12:15.735 --> 12:16.870
That's about it.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.205
You didn't tell
him the real reason?

12:18.238 --> 12:19.106
Why should I?

12:19.139 --> 12:20.908
I know what the problems are.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.742
Roseanne, he's too young for me.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.144
He's not ready to get married.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.981
And by the time he wants kids,
all my eggs will be dried up.

12:28.015 --> 12:31.819
I really don't need to
hear him agree with me, OK?

12:31.852 --> 12:33.086
OK.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.754
No, it's just crazy.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.689
He's the right guy.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.292
I broke up with him
for the wrong reasons!

12:39.326 --> 12:40.127
I'm gonna to call him.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.067
You stink at this.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.440
OK, Deej, this is how
they line up for face-off.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.542
Now, what position are
you gonna play tonight?

12:55.575 --> 12:58.378
The coach said I'd be
equally good at any position.

13:02.482 --> 13:06.019
You know, Deej, it's not
important how well you play,

13:06.053 --> 13:10.858
or how much you play, or
even that you play at all.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.325
What is important?

13:16.830 --> 13:18.065
That's something
you're going to have

13:18.098 --> 13:20.567
to find out for yourself.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.502
ROSEANNE: Hey, can we
have some pizza in here!

13:22.535 --> 13:23.837
Yeah, OK!

13:23.871 --> 13:25.973
If I don't get it out there
in 30 seconds, it's free!

13:30.310 --> 13:33.146
So, Deej, you really want
to know how to play hockey?

13:33.180 --> 13:34.314
Yeah.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.615
All right.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.584
Say this guy's in front of
you, and he's got the puck.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.818
What do you do?

13:38.852 --> 13:40.620
Try and steal it from him.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.022
No.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.190
You do this.

13:43.223 --> 13:46.026
[slams the table]

13:51.464 --> 13:53.700
Any questions?

13:53.733 --> 13:57.637
[music playing]

14:03.676 --> 14:05.145
Well, there's a
lot of excitement

14:05.178 --> 14:07.847
here at the Landford Arena
as we enter the second period

14:07.881 --> 14:09.682
of the Otter's home opener.

14:09.716 --> 14:10.984
The goalie is back
from the restroom,

14:11.018 --> 14:12.485
and the action is resuming.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.955
And the Cinderella
story of the evening

14:14.988 --> 14:18.791
continues to be young DJ Conner
on the ice much to the surprise

14:18.825 --> 14:20.027
of his entire family.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.029
And, oh, there's a breakaway!
There's a breakaway!

14:22.062 --> 14:23.796
Young Conner moves
towards the goal.

14:23.830 --> 14:28.268
He shoots!
Oh, he forgot the puck!

14:28.301 --> 14:31.538
And, Roseanne, why don't you
pick us up on the action.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.439
OK.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.374
Uh, there's a little kid.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.742
I don't know his name.

14:35.775 --> 14:39.212
He shoots the puck to
this other little kid,

14:39.246 --> 14:40.313
I don't know his name either.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.614
OK, back to me!

14:41.648 --> 14:43.683
What's your take on
the game, Jackie?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.919
[jackie blows her nose]
Back to me again.

14:45.953 --> 14:46.886
[whistle blows]

14:46.920 --> 14:48.355
Hey, that kid's a maniac!

14:48.388 --> 14:49.322
Get him off the ice!

14:49.356 --> 14:50.790
He's gonna hurt somebody!

14:50.823 --> 14:54.161
[crowd booing]

14:55.728 --> 14:58.031
Wow.
What a bodycheck.

14:58.065 --> 15:02.169
Who'd of thought the little
runt would be a thug.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.736
Hey, it ain't his
fault. It's that one

15:03.770 --> 15:05.272
kid that took the puck.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.639
Go over there and make
sure he's all right.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.212
Here you go, Deej.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.746
I got you nachos.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.783
I'll bring you a
drink next penalty.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.251
You know, son, one
more roughing call,

15:18.285 --> 15:19.586
you got the hat trick.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.957
Oh, man.

15:23.991 --> 15:24.857
Hey.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.226
Hey.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.127
What are you doing here?

15:27.160 --> 15:28.661
I came to see DJ play.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.498
Is it all right if I sit down?

15:31.531 --> 15:32.332
Yeah, sure.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.170
So how's DJ doing?

15:37.204 --> 15:38.371
I don't see him out there.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.606
Well, he's in his office.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.213
Like he really cares.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.447
What's that supposed to mean?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.316
He just showed up here
because he knew I'd be here.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.617
Well, I can't reach
you on the phone.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.884
I don't want to talk to you.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.253
This is totally unfair.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.822
You can't break up with someone
without telling them why.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.557
- Tell him why, Jackie--
- I'm not gonna tell him why.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.591
I don't have nothing to say.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.926
And stay out of it
for once, Roseanne.

15:59.959 --> 16:00.827
OK, fine.

16:00.860 --> 16:04.031
It's your life.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.533
She thinks the age
difference is a problem.

16:06.566 --> 16:11.138
You know, she thinks there's
a gap between 25 and 37.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.339
I thought you
said you were 34.

16:18.578 --> 16:22.082
Well, now, see, this
failure to communicate

16:22.115 --> 16:24.451
is maybe what's screwing
up the relationship.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.719
Shut up, Roseanne.

16:26.753 --> 16:27.954
I know what you're doing.

16:27.987 --> 16:28.855
OK.

16:28.888 --> 16:32.292
OK, I'm out of it.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.693
She don't think you
want to get married.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.228
No, I didn't say that.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.629
Stop talking to him.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.730
You did too say that.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.232
You said by the time
he's ready to have kids,

16:39.266 --> 16:42.102
all your eggs is going
to be all dried up.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.136
Can I say something here?

16:43.170 --> 16:44.171
No.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.307
I think you should
let her finish, OK?

16:47.340 --> 16:50.710
She has a very important
point to make, Fisher.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.445
I mean, after all,
you probably will

16:52.479 --> 16:54.514
dumper for some younger woman.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.915
Hold it!

16:55.948 --> 16:57.684
I can't believe
you thought that.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.586
I mean, as much fun
as we have together,

16:59.619 --> 17:01.020
I never think of you
being older than me.

17:01.054 --> 17:01.921
[roseanne scoffs]

17:01.954 --> 17:02.922
You really mean that?

17:02.955 --> 17:04.291
Of course I mean it.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.126
And I never said I didn't want
to get married or have kids.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.494
We never even talked about it.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.561
I know.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.297
It's just a real
sensitive subject for me.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.564
You know, this is crazy.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.300
Why don't we go some place,
we'll get some coffee,

17:13.333 --> 17:14.201
and we'll talk about it.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.502
Yeah, I'd really like that.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.836
You know, I was
miserable without you.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.271
Well, yeah, me too.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.606
Guys, will you
take your squabbling

17:19.639 --> 17:21.974
elsewhere so I can see my kid
play his last hockey game.

17:22.008 --> 17:22.875
OK.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.178
But next time stay out of it.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.746
Oh, you're welcome!

17:26.779 --> 17:27.847
[referee whistles]

17:27.880 --> 17:29.582
Where are they going?

17:29.616 --> 17:32.585
They're going to try to figure
out how to thank me for saving

17:32.619 --> 17:34.020
their miserable lives.

17:34.053 --> 17:34.954
My hero!

17:37.390 --> 17:38.591
Hey, look.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.593
They're gonna let the little
monster out of his cage.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.594
DJ!
ALL: (CHANTING) DJ!

17:41.628 --> 17:42.995
DJ!
DJ!

17:43.029 --> 17:43.996
DJ!

17:44.030 --> 17:44.997
DJ!

17:45.031 --> 17:48.501
[crash, groaning]

17:49.502 --> 17:52.872
[crowd boos]

17:57.544 --> 18:00.247
Where does a kid get
that kind of hostility?

18:04.717 --> 18:08.488
[music playing]

18:09.956 --> 18:10.890
Hockey's great.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.461
You get to hurt guys
and people clap.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.629
Hey, you know the whole
point isn't to hurt somebody,

18:16.663 --> 18:17.930
don't you?

18:17.964 --> 18:20.066
Your mom's really worried if
keep slamming into people,

18:20.099 --> 18:22.034
you're going to break something.

18:22.068 --> 18:22.935
But it's fun.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.539
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

18:26.573 --> 18:29.509
Here's to the roughest,
toughest Otter of 'em all.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.677
The Termin-Otter!

18:33.913 --> 18:34.814
Dad.

18:34.847 --> 18:35.782
Yeah?

18:35.815 --> 18:38.084
Can I have a
taste of your beer?

18:38.117 --> 18:41.288
Nah, you're too young, Deej.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.323
Just a sip?

18:43.356 --> 18:44.157
No, you wouldn't like it.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.996
Please?

18:50.029 --> 18:51.164
OK, but just one.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.240
[gulps]

19:00.273 --> 19:02.975
Remember that.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.244
Hey.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.144
Roseanne around?

19:05.178 --> 19:06.446
Yeah, she's in
the living room.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.081
Aunt Jackie, my knee is
three different colors.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.650
That's great, hon!

19:10.683 --> 19:13.420
You must be really proud, Dan.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.756
Roseanne, I've got
something to tell you.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.191
Oh, I hope it's good
news, because we're

19:18.225 --> 19:20.860
out of chocolate syrup.

19:20.893 --> 19:24.997
- I'm moving in with Fisher.
- What?

19:25.031 --> 19:25.932
JACKIE: Isn't it great?

19:25.965 --> 19:27.534
No, Jackie, it's not great.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.435
Why?

19:28.468 --> 19:30.470
I thought you liked Fisher.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.105
Well, I do, but you just
barely broke up with him.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.741
And now you turn around,
and the next second

19:34.774 --> 19:36.142
you're moving in with you?
- I know.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.277
It's a big step.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.779
And I really think it's
the right thing to do.

19:39.812 --> 19:45.385
Don't you think it's just
a tad bit completely insane?

19:45.418 --> 19:48.488
Why can't you ever be
supportive of what I'm doing?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.122
I'm waiting for you
to do something right.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.459
Well, I just want
you to be happy for me.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.826
Oh, OK, fine.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.727
Hey!

19:54.761 --> 19:56.128
Listen to this.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.698
Jack is about to do something
really, really stupid,

19:58.731 --> 20:00.333
but it doesn't really affect us.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.669
So I say we celebrate!

20:02.702 --> 20:04.737
I'm moving in with Fisher.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.240
Does that mean Fisher
can keep coaching me?

20:07.274 --> 20:08.341
Sure does.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.076
DJ, have you been drinking?

20:15.948 --> 20:16.983
Come here.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.223
You go upstairs and
brush your teeth!

20:31.631 --> 20:35.702
Well, Dan, I guess you're
just so damn proud of your kid

20:35.735 --> 20:38.771
out there ramming people
and smashing into them

20:38.805 --> 20:40.440
that you just had to
celebrate by giving

20:40.473 --> 20:43.276
him is very first sip of beer!
- I had to.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.344
The hooker made him nervous.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.721
Come on, you gave me
my first sip of beer.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.689
That was different.
I was drunk.

21:00.293 --> 21:04.531
[theme music]

21:08.501 --> 21:14.507
Well, Dan, just so very proud
of your son ramming and smashing

21:14.541 --> 21:16.175
into people on the
ice that you just

21:16.208 --> 21:18.010
couldn't wait to give him
his very first sip of beer,

21:18.044 --> 21:18.911
could ya?

21:18.945 --> 21:19.812
I had to.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.314
The hooker made him nervous.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.281
Dan!

21:22.315 --> 21:25.117
[pan dings]

21:35.528 --> 21:36.396
What?

21:36.429 --> 21:38.431
[jackie giggling]

21:44.537 --> 21:46.839
[laughter]

21:48.140 --> 21:49.308
I can't feel anything
on this side.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.209
What's going on?

21:50.242 --> 21:52.579
[laughter]
