Airport jail.

01:34.040 --> 01:36.580
So, you sure you're okay
Ubering home from here?

01:36.580 --> 01:39.040
Yeah, of course. I mean, you
can't be late for your shift.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.210
But I'm not leaving
until I see you in uniform.

01:41.210 --> 01:43.000
Yeah, this isn't the kind
of job where we can

01:43.000 --> 01:45.460

Oh, I know.

a little under the microscope.

They literally evaluate me
at the end of every shift.

01:51.670 --> 01:52.710
Are you worried
I'll make you look bad?

01:52.710 --> 01:54.330
No, that's --

01:54.330 --> 01:56.580
Okay, let me, um,
get a fresh start here.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.080
Obviously, the threat
of airport jail

01:58.080 --> 01:59.670
has me a little
off my game.

01:59.670 --> 02:02.580
I am thrilled
to have you here, okay?

02:02.580 --> 02:05.540
Okay.
Just maybe don't tell any
embarrassing stories about me.

02:05.540 --> 02:07.290
Mm, that's gonna be hard.
There are so many.

02:07.290 --> 02:08.540
Really,
there's not, though.
Yeah.

02:08.540 --> 02:10.880
My sixth birthday.
Easter 2009.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.790
The turducken.
Do not tell that story.

02:12.790 --> 02:14.080
-Oh.
-What story?

02:14.080 --> 02:16.500
Hey! Jackson and Lucy,
this is --

02:16.500 --> 02:19.670
-Henry. What's up, bro?
-Hey! Nice to see you.

02:19.670 --> 02:22.210
-You guys know my son?
-Yeah, on, uh, social media.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.670
Yeah, I-I followed them
after you guys

02:23.670 --> 02:25.500
started hanging out together
at the Academy.

02:25.500 --> 02:26.880
They followed me back.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.380
Lucy: You know what?
That photo that you posted

02:28.380 --> 02:30.380
earlier from the plane
was horrifying.

02:30.380 --> 02:31.960
-Dude, I literally almost puked.
-Thanks for that.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.290
Okay, the guy in
the next aisle over

02:33.290 --> 02:35.750
straight up cleaned his dentures
on the tray table.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.250
-Gross.
-Bad.

02:37.250 --> 02:38.880
Wait, how come
you didn't tell me

02:38.880 --> 02:41.170
you were friends with my son
on the Insta thing?

02:41.170 --> 02:42.880
Well, it didn't seem
like a big deal.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.460
Yeah. It's 2019, Dad.
Get with the times.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.000
-Yeah. Dad.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.620
-That was a good one.
-Yeah, thank you.

02:50.620 --> 02:52.170
Yeah.

02:52.170 --> 02:53.880
Sgt. Grey: All right.
Look alive, look alive.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.790
Officer Nolan,
you ready?

02:55.790 --> 02:57.540
Yes, sir.
-Good. Now, answer me this.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.750
What is your favorite part
about the job?

02:59.750 --> 03:01.380
And don't say
"To make a difference."

03:01.380 --> 03:03.330
I wasn't going to.

03:03.330 --> 03:05.000
But it is.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.830
-What's your least favorite?
-Oh, that's easy.

03:06.830 --> 03:07.880
Paperwork.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.380
Imagine how I feel.

03:09.380 --> 03:11.830
All right.

03:11.830 --> 03:14.000
Most of what
a captain does is paperwork.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.540
'Cause of that,
I feel like I've lost touch

03:16.540 --> 03:18.540
with what being a cop
is really about.

03:18.540 --> 03:20.830
People. It's not only
the citizens

03:20.830 --> 03:22.120
that we serve
and protect.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.790
It's every single
one of you in this room.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.460
So, to remedy that,

03:26.460 --> 03:29.170
I've decided Sergeant Grey and I
are gonna ride patrol today.

03:29.170 --> 03:31.000
Together?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.790
No. We're each gonna
ride with a rookie,

03:32.790 --> 03:34.290
and their respective T.O.s
will pair up.

03:34.290 --> 03:36.880
Ma'am, I'd be honored
if you'd ride with me.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.540
That is sweet,
Officer West,

03:39.540 --> 03:42.000
but today I'm riding
with Officer Chen.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.790
Sergeant Grey,
I'd be honored

03:44.790 --> 03:47.170
if you rode with
Officer West today.

03:47.170 --> 03:49.170
That's cute,
Officer Nolan.

03:49.170 --> 03:52.080
But you know my heart
belongs to you.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.880
Lucky me.

03:55.830 --> 03:57.460
Tim: Lot of weight on
your shoulders today, Boot.

03:57.460 --> 03:58.830
Lucy:
Why? What do you mean?

03:58.830 --> 04:01.170
Talia: Riding with the captain
is a huge responsibility.

04:01.170 --> 04:03.120
If anything
happens to her, well...

04:03.120 --> 04:04.920
I don't even know how
to finish that sentence.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.540
I do.
Andersen gets a scratch,

04:06.540 --> 04:08.000
and you'll be working
motor pool in Sylmar

04:08.000 --> 04:09.960
till you die of
carbon monoxide poisoning.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.620
Jackson: Why do you think Lucy
and Nolan got picked over me?

04:14.620 --> 04:16.460
Two words --
body odor.

04:16.460 --> 04:18.250
I'm serious.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.750
It means something, doesn't it?
Andersen's clearly

04:20.750 --> 04:23.000
playing favorites
riding with Lucy.
Maybe.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.120
But do you really think Nolan
is Grey's favorite?

04:26.120 --> 04:28.040
-No.
-Then stop worrying so much.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.000
Leave me alone!

04:30.000 --> 04:31.290
-Okay. Dropping it.
-Not you.

04:31.290 --> 04:32.500
My phone.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.380
Or, rather, my mom.
-What'd she do?

04:34.380 --> 04:35.880
She wants to know
if I'm bringing a date

04:35.880 --> 04:37.620
to my brother's wedding.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.670
That sounds...

04:39.670 --> 04:42.500
reasonable.
Not when there's
extras on it.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.000
Meaning?
If I don't bring a date,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.460
she'll spend the whole night
trying to set me up

04:45.460 --> 04:48.170
with the
best man, Hugo.
Mm.

04:48.170 --> 04:50.830
I'm guessing
Hugo's not your type.
He smells like
kitty litter.

04:50.830 --> 04:52.290
And I don't even think
he owns a cat.

04:52.290 --> 04:53.620
Spent my niece's baptism

04:53.620 --> 04:54.920
bragging about
how much he squats.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.080
Maybe he squats
kitty litter.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.880
You're not helping.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.750
Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting.
What do you think?

05:07.750 --> 05:09.420
Awesome.
Oh.

05:09.420 --> 05:11.000
That belt looks
super uncomfortable, though.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.380
Yeah, I have a bruise where
the gun digs into my hip.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.000
You made a friend.
-Yeah.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.830
Dominique was just giving me
the scoop on this place.

05:16.830 --> 05:18.670
Her dad works here.
-Oh, really?

05:18.670 --> 05:20.920
Yeah. He's the
watch commander.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.500
Your dad
is Sergeant Grey?

05:22.500 --> 05:25.500
Sgt. Grey: Officer Nolan.
Why aren't you getting our gear?

05:25.500 --> 05:27.830
I was just getting my son
squared away.

05:27.830 --> 05:29.500
He just flew in this morning
from college.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.830
-Dominique?
-Hey, Dad.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.170
You forgot I was interning
here today, didn't you?

05:34.170 --> 05:35.670
No.

05:35.670 --> 05:37.830
I intern at different
divisions on Saturdays.

05:37.830 --> 05:39.580
-Oh, for college.
-High school.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.330
My daughter's a senior
in high school.

05:41.330 --> 05:43.790
Wait, why did you tell
Henry's dad to get your gear?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.790
Are you riding patrol?

05:46.790 --> 05:48.000
Captain's orders.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.500
Really?

05:49.500 --> 05:51.790
Does Mom know?
-Haven't told her yet.

05:51.790 --> 05:54.670
Well, I'm happy
not to tell her, too.

05:54.670 --> 05:57.580
Long as you don't tell her about
that "C" I got in Macrobiology.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.330
You know that's not the way
we do things in our house.

06:02.330 --> 06:04.670
-So that's a "No"?
-We'll talk about it later.

06:04.670 --> 06:07.000
Officer Nolan,
let's go.
Yes, sir.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.920
It's a 12-hour shift,
so I'll probably be late.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.170
Okay.
Oh, he can stay here
with me if he wants.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.920
That way, you two
can have lunch together.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.120
That's okay,
right, Dad?

06:19.040 --> 06:20.920
-Sure.
-Great.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.000
Yeah. You can tell me all the
things my dad doesn't want me

06:23.000 --> 06:24.790
to know about his new job.

06:26.540 --> 06:28.670
-Great.
-Here. Give me some of these.

06:28.670 --> 06:30.710
I'll help you.

06:30.710 --> 06:32.330
I would say
there's a lot of stuff.
Give me a little bit.

06:36.170 --> 06:38.420
-So, you didn't get the gear?
-Neither did you.

06:38.420 --> 06:39.620
Do I look
like your boot?

06:39.620 --> 06:41.170
You were once.
-For two weeks.

06:41.170 --> 06:42.670
A long time ago.

06:42.670 --> 06:43.920
So unless you have
a time machine,

06:43.920 --> 06:45.330
it looks like
we're at an impasse.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.500
I have an idea.

06:57.380 --> 07:00.250
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

07:00.250 --> 07:02.620
Oh, um, Officer Bradford
told me

07:02.620 --> 07:04.670
to set up their shop,
as well, so I'm just...

07:05.790 --> 07:07.460
Bradford, Bishop!

07:10.960 --> 07:12.290
Yes, Captain?

07:12.290 --> 07:13.880
Officer Chen
is my boot today.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.920
Is that
perfectly clear?

07:15.920 --> 07:17.580
-Yes, ma'am.
-Get your gear.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.460
Thanks.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.120
You want to quiz me
on procedure?

07:39.120 --> 07:41.540
Do I look like
a game show host to you?

07:41.540 --> 07:43.120
Go find some crime.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.000
Make a difference
in our community today.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.580
Maybe we should head for
a rougher part of town.

07:54.580 --> 07:56.040
Are you saying
only crime happens

07:56.040 --> 07:58.000
in low-income neighborhoods,
Officer Nolan?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.750
No, sir.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.380
Oh, all right.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.670
Here we go.
Vehicle code violation.

08:05.670 --> 08:07.290
Ooh.
What's your PC?

08:07.290 --> 08:09.120
Uh, well,
take your pick.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.330
We have, uh, broken taillight,
obstructed view,

08:12.330 --> 08:14.380
driving
all over the place.

08:14.380 --> 08:15.790
Pull her over?

08:15.790 --> 08:17.540
Are you asking me
or telling me?

08:20.540 --> 08:22.000
Control,
this is 7-Adam-15.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.830
We are on a car stop,
Toluca Lake and Ponca.

08:24.830 --> 08:27.120
California plate
Tom-Union-Frank.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.290
George-Robert-
Adam-Nora-Yellow.

08:29.290 --> 08:30.540
How close are you
supposed to park

08:30.540 --> 08:32.380
to a suspect vehicle,
Officer Nolan?

08:32.380 --> 08:34.830
Oh. Uh, one car length,
more or less.

08:34.830 --> 08:36.330
Sorry.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.790
Is this
a felony stop now?

08:39.790 --> 08:41.170
No, sir. Sorry.

08:43.710 --> 08:45.710
Still probably
a little too...

08:48.670 --> 08:50.380
That's it.

08:50.380 --> 08:51.920
This is embarrassing.
I'm feeling
a little nervous.

08:54.330 --> 08:56.830
Are you happy
with your positioning?
I'm --

08:58.670 --> 08:59.880
Shouldn't I be?

08:59.880 --> 09:01.460
It's non-tactical.

09:01.460 --> 09:03.210
The engine block should be
positioned at an angle

09:03.210 --> 09:04.830
just in case we have
to take cover behind it.

09:04.830 --> 09:07.040
Sir,
she's an elderly woman.

09:08.580 --> 09:10.710
You don't agree?
I think you should plan
for the worst.

09:10.710 --> 09:13.330
Right.
But if you're happy
with it, fine.

09:23.670 --> 09:25.500
Hello, there, ma'am.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.330
Uh, looks like you were swerving
around the street a little bit,

09:27.330 --> 09:29.540
and I noticed you have
a broken taillight.

09:29.540 --> 09:32.080
Can we talk
on the sidewalk?

09:32.080 --> 09:33.920
I don't like
you standing out there

09:33.920 --> 09:36.670
in the street like that.
It's so dangerous.

09:36.670 --> 09:39.040
-Of course. Give you a hand?
-Yeah.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.670
-Careful.

09:41.670 --> 09:43.710
All right. Nice and easy,
nice and slow.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.210
Yeah. You know,

09:45.210 --> 09:49.040
I haven't
had a ticket in 25 years.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.080
You seem
like a nice man.

09:52.210 --> 09:54.880
Can you just let me off
with a warning?

09:54.880 --> 09:56.330
Just this once?

09:56.330 --> 09:58.170
Make a decision, Boot.

10:00.420 --> 10:02.040
I don't see why not.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.960
Just do me a favor --
get that brake light fixed,

10:03.960 --> 10:05.420
and if you're gonna
pick a side of the road,

10:05.420 --> 10:06.580
make sure
it's the right side.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.210
Officer Nolan.

10:08.210 --> 10:10.000
Have you identified
everyone in the vehicle?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.960
Oh, that's just my son.
He's sleeping.

10:16.210 --> 10:17.880
Sir, can you step
out of the car?

10:17.880 --> 10:20.620
He wasn't even driving. W-Why do
you need to talk to him?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.330
I just need to identify
everyone in the vehicle.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.420
Sir.

10:24.420 --> 10:26.880
Step out of the car
for me, would you? Thanks.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.380
Oh. W-Whoa.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.380
Labor must
have been hell.

10:33.380 --> 10:36.500
Sir, I, uh, need your name
and date of birth, please.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.250
Don't tell him
a damn thing.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.620
Ma'am, he's required by law
to give me that information.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.120
Run, Bryce!

10:42.120 --> 10:43.920
-Don't even think about it.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.670
Sgt. Grey:
Hands over your head.

10:45.670 --> 10:46.960
-You, too, Grandma.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.040
-Officer Nolan.
-Uh-huh?

10:52.040 --> 10:54.620
-How you doing?
-Good.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.670
Hello?

11:10.670 --> 11:11.960
Police!

11:18.330 --> 11:20.620
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

11:20.620 --> 11:22.330
Hey! Hey, enough!

11:22.330 --> 11:23.500
I'll call
for an interpreter.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.000
Yes.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.420
Our marriage
is over.

11:40.420 --> 11:42.500
I made a mistake
of telling him

11:42.500 --> 11:44.500
he could come by
and get a few things.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.000
Then he starts
destroying the whole house!

11:47.000 --> 11:50.080
Nothing we shared matters
to her anymore.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.670
I love you, Mehrnaz.
Why are you throwing us away?

11:52.670 --> 11:55.330
I cannot keep doing this
with you, Dariush.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.880
Sir, clearly,
you're in a lot of pain,

12:00.880 --> 12:03.170
but what you need to do
is get a lawyer, see a judge,

12:03.170 --> 12:04.920
and they will help you
to divide your property.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.080
Lawyers? Judges?

12:07.080 --> 12:09.170
Strangers!

12:09.170 --> 12:10.880
My wife is leaving me.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.580
My life is over.

12:12.580 --> 12:14.210
Ma'am, do you want
to press charges?

12:14.210 --> 12:16.290
No. I just
want him out.

12:16.290 --> 12:19.040
Officer Chen, can you escort
Mr. Ghorbani outside, please?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.290
Come on.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.830
Hey!

12:30.830 --> 12:32.170
He's got a gun
in the master bedroom.

12:32.170 --> 12:33.830
Officer Chen,
there's a gun upstairs!

12:33.830 --> 12:35.000
Stay right there.

12:40.170 --> 12:41.580
-What do we do?
-Straddle the door.

12:41.580 --> 12:43.170
Talk him out of there.
Try not to get shot.

12:47.040 --> 12:50.000
Mr. Ghorbani,
I need you to come out now.

13:17.170 --> 13:20.040
Uh, so, it's just all the way up
these stairs and straight back.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.080
Thank you.

13:22.750 --> 13:25.120
All units, be advised,
we're Code 4 here.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.670
Situation's
under control.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.920
Is this my fault?

13:33.920 --> 13:36.290
Should I have given him
another chance?

13:37.920 --> 13:40.540
You couldn't have known that
he was gonna react like that.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.000
There's no way.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.380
My mother
is still in Iran.

13:46.380 --> 13:49.120
She told me
to work things out.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.420
That marriage is sacred.

13:51.420 --> 13:54.080
But we were so unhappy.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.000
It's just --

13:57.580 --> 14:00.460
You know, my mother
said the same thing to me

14:00.460 --> 14:02.210
when my marriage ended.

14:02.210 --> 14:03.830
She lives in La Cañada.

14:05.670 --> 14:09.000
You can't control
how people are gonna react.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.880
I wish we could.

14:26.330 --> 14:28.920
Captain?
Reinforcements just showed up.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.460
Captain.
Anything we can do to help?

14:34.460 --> 14:36.500
Yeah. You can get your ass
back out on the street

14:36.500 --> 14:37.620
and handle some calls.

14:37.620 --> 14:39.670
We heard
there were shots fired.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.960
Did you also hear Officer Chen
put out the all-clear?

14:41.960 --> 14:44.540
Did you think you were gonna pop
by for a little moral support?

14:44.540 --> 14:46.500
Did you want to come inside,
maybe check the fridge?

14:47.460 --> 14:49.120
No, ma'am.
I-I just figured --

14:49.120 --> 14:51.330
The woman inside just watched
her husband take his own life.

14:51.330 --> 14:53.040
I don't think she's in the mood
to host a party.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.500
What do you think?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.210
Understood.

14:57.210 --> 15:00.080
We'll go back out
on patrol. Sorry.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.710
I think they were
just trying to help.

15:03.710 --> 15:05.920
-We didn't need it.
-Yeah. I --

15:05.920 --> 15:07.750
I let the guy
get upstairs.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.080
Yes, you did.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.620
He's not dead
because of that.

15:17.620 --> 15:20.080
Nolan: That lady
is crazy strong.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.080
And who'd have thought she'd
have more outstanding warrants

15:22.080 --> 15:23.420
than her
Sasquatch kid?

15:23.420 --> 15:25.580
By the way you're walking,

15:25.580 --> 15:27.540
I'd say she could kick
field goals for the Rams.

15:27.540 --> 15:29.120
Don't remind me.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.380
She does this
on purpose.

15:39.380 --> 15:40.790
Just to push
my buttons.

15:40.790 --> 15:43.460
Well,
that's what kids do.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.540
So, why wouldn't your wife be
happy with you riding patrol?

15:45.540 --> 15:47.460
My wife
is not your concern.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.420
And after your performance
this morning,

15:49.420 --> 15:51.710
I'd say you need
to focus on the job.

15:51.710 --> 15:54.040
Yes, sir.
Let's go.

15:55.460 --> 15:57.000
Jackson: I mean,
how could we not respond?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.880
It was
a shots-fired call.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.750
Did the captain
ask for backup?

16:00.750 --> 16:03.420
No. But --
But nothing.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.000
She's not
a damsel in distress.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.330
If that were Grey,
would you have insisted

16:06.330 --> 16:08.330
we ride in
like the cavalry?

16:08.330 --> 16:10.000
And now you created
a real problem,

16:10.000 --> 16:11.500
instead of the fake one
you made up in your head.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.920
Wesley: Stop that guy!
He's getting away!

16:14.920 --> 16:16.330
Hey, stop!

16:16.330 --> 16:18.420
-Let go of me.
-Calm down.

16:18.420 --> 16:20.500
Calm down? I was just chasing
the guy that stole my briefcase,

16:20.500 --> 16:22.040
but you let him get away.
And, by the way,

16:22.040 --> 16:24.040
you're supposed
to identify yourself

16:24.040 --> 16:26.330
before you engage a suspect.
-"A," I had no way of knowing

16:26.330 --> 16:27.620
you were the victim here,
and "B,"

16:27.620 --> 16:28.830
I didn't have time
to identify myself

16:28.830 --> 16:30.620
due to the immediacy
of the situation.

16:30.620 --> 16:32.120
Try that on someone
who isn't a lawyer.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.830
Do you want to file a report
on your briefcase

16:33.830 --> 16:35.290
or keep telling me
how to do my job?

16:35.290 --> 16:36.500
Well, I don't
have all day,

16:36.500 --> 16:37.790
so I guess
I'll file a report.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.790
How about I take care
of the report

16:39.790 --> 16:41.250
and you go
enjoy your coffee?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.000
I have a locator in my
briefcase. If we go now,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.460
I can track it.
Yeah, we can't
just wander around

16:44.460 --> 16:46.000
on a scavenger hunt.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.830
Okay, can you give us
a second, please?

16:47.830 --> 16:49.000
Yeah.

16:50.830 --> 16:52.500
Look, maybe
we should help him.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.330
Otherwise, I bet
he'll file a complaint.

16:55.330 --> 16:56.920
Fine. But if he gives me
any more attitude,

16:56.920 --> 16:57.960
he's gonna
taste pepper spray.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.830
Let's go.
-Let's go.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.960
Yeah.
This is gonna go great.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.710
Tim: All right. I'll be contact,
you be cover.

17:06.710 --> 17:08.540
You don't trust me
to be contact?

17:08.540 --> 17:10.170
Fine. You be contact,
I'll be cover.

17:10.170 --> 17:11.500
Don't do me
any favors.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.540
-What's going on?
-You called 911 --

17:14.540 --> 17:16.330
-But you said --
-Said I was gonna be con--

17:16.330 --> 17:17.830
Never mind.

17:17.830 --> 17:19.500
Go ahead.
-Okay. What's the problem?

17:19.500 --> 17:21.250
We've had
some recent break-ins.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.670
We had one last night.

17:22.670 --> 17:24.170
I went to do
laundry just now,

17:24.170 --> 17:26.170
and someone's hiding
in the basement.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.830
-Are you sure it's not a tenant?
-Yes.

17:27.830 --> 17:30.080
I shouted, and
he didn't say anything.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.040
But I know
he is still down there.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.710
Okay. We'll check it out.
Go wait in your apartment.

17:42.750 --> 17:45.380
-Downward-facing stairway --
-Stairway, downward facing --

17:45.380 --> 17:46.620
I'm calling this.
Of course you are.

17:46.620 --> 17:48.120
I do have
more experience.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.790
You take point, Officer Bishop.
I'll hook left.

17:49.790 --> 17:51.380
Oh, so now it's
"Officer Bishop," huh?

17:51.380 --> 17:53.290
Mm. Fine. After you.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.670
-LAP--
-Police.

17:55.670 --> 17:57.380
-LAPD!
-Police!

18:01.210 --> 18:03.790
Looks clear so far.
You just keep holding point.

18:03.790 --> 18:05.540
It's a box, Tim.
There's no one here.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.460
Stick to the S.O.P.s,
just like I taught you.

18:07.460 --> 18:10.880
"Standard Operating Procedures"
also means use common sense.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.080
My T.O. after you
was big on common sense.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.380
Officer Belgrave's
safety tactics are for crap.

18:15.380 --> 18:17.420
Oh, here we go.
The great SWAT debate.

18:17.420 --> 18:19.420
There's no debate. There's
a right way and a wrong way.

18:19.420 --> 18:21.750
Tim: He's in there.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.500
You breach the door.
I'll take point from here.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.460
Dynamic entry. Remember to get
clear of the fatal funnel.

18:25.460 --> 18:27.250
You breach the door.
I breached the last one.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.330
And we should use the "wedge
and slow search" technique.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.830
Behind the panel.

18:43.380 --> 18:44.790
Suspect.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.710
LAPD.
We hear you in there.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.080
Slowly open the door
and show us your hands.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.620
Control, 7-Adam-15,

18:50.620 --> 18:53.040
we have a possible 459 suspect
at our location.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.500
Send us
another unit.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.420
Why'd you call
for backup?

18:56.420 --> 18:58.170
If we can't handle one mope,
we shouldn't be doing this job.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.750
-What if it's not just a mope?
-If it's not a mope,

18:59.750 --> 19:01.040
he wouldn't
be hiding in there.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.880
Now, breach that door.
-What for?

19:02.880 --> 19:04.670
He's not going anywhere.
Time's on our side.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.290
Officer Bishop,
do I need to remind you

19:06.290 --> 19:07.710
I'm senior officer
on scene?

19:07.710 --> 19:09.080
Which means
I'm in charge.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.210
Now, breach that door.

19:20.380 --> 19:21.500
Aah! Aah!

19:21.500 --> 19:23.000
-What? What?
-Aah!

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Skunk, skunk!

19:25.000 --> 19:26.790
Oh, hell no!

19:32.540 --> 19:35.120
Rob: You don't even have a
parking permit. Move your car.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.420
Javier: Well, what are you
gonna do, make me?

19:36.420 --> 19:37.620
I got to make you?
What, are you 12 years old?

19:37.620 --> 19:38.790
Look how you parked
the car, my man!

19:38.790 --> 19:41.670
Take my keys and do it for me.
-Gentlemen.

19:41.670 --> 19:42.830
Oh, you gonna walk because
the police is here now?

19:42.830 --> 19:44.620
Gentlemen!!
Hey, hey, hey.

19:44.620 --> 19:45.670
What seems
to be the problem?

19:45.670 --> 19:46.710
This is my spot.

19:46.710 --> 19:49.210
Screw that.
He stole it from me.

19:49.210 --> 19:51.210
Man, the hell I did.
I got here first,

19:51.210 --> 19:52.540
and he
cut me off.

19:52.540 --> 19:53.880
Okay. Okay.
I-I don't understand.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.540
It's a parking spot.
Just get another one.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.670
My daughter
is having a party.

19:57.670 --> 19:59.460
I have the cake
in the trunk.

19:59.460 --> 20:02.000
All right. The game's about to
start. I got the beer all ready.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.830
Screw your daughter.
-Hey, hey, hey!

20:03.830 --> 20:06.040
Hey, hey! Whoa!
-Get on the ground.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.000
Get on the ground right now.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.500
How was I supposed to
know there was a skunk in there?

20:27.500 --> 20:29.460
Oh. If we had done
a wedge and a slow search,

20:29.460 --> 20:30.710
you would've seen
from a safe distance.

20:30.710 --> 20:32.170
Give me the keys.
Let me drive.

20:32.170 --> 20:33.620
I'll get us there faster.
-Forget that.

20:33.620 --> 20:36.330
There's no way I'm letting you
in my shop smelling like that.

20:36.330 --> 20:37.540
Then what the hell
am I supposed to do?

20:37.540 --> 20:39.170
Oh, now you want
my advice.

20:39.170 --> 20:40.960
Well, here it is.
Call a cab.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.710
Jackson: So, what's in the
briefcase that's so important?

20:47.710 --> 20:49.210
Wesley:
Handwritten depositions.

20:49.210 --> 20:50.710
If I lose them,
my client could go to jail.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.620
Lopez: Maybe your client
belongs in jail.

20:52.620 --> 20:55.380
-Why handwritten?
-Protects my clients' privacy.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.670
I don't trust the cloud
with anything important.

20:56.670 --> 20:58.670
Wait, wait.

20:58.670 --> 21:00.040
He should be
right around the corner.

21:03.380 --> 21:05.210
Hey.

21:05.210 --> 21:06.500
Lopez:
Police! Stop!

21:09.460 --> 21:10.920
Wesley:
Hey, hey. Take it easy.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.040
-What?
-You don't have to be so rough.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.920
You're criticizing
my arrest?

21:14.920 --> 21:16.170
'Cause I was expecting
a thank-you

21:16.170 --> 21:17.710
for getting
your briefcase back.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.750
The law defines excessive force
as a use of force

21:19.750 --> 21:21.420
greater than that
which a reasonable officer

21:21.420 --> 21:23.420
would use
under the circumstances.

21:23.420 --> 21:25.580
-He makes a good point.
-Nobody's talking to you.

21:25.580 --> 21:26.920
Are you gonna
read him his rig--

21:26.920 --> 21:28.420
I will if you shut up
for a minute.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.290
Jackson: I'll do it.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.620
What the hell
is your problem?

21:31.620 --> 21:33.290
For starters,
your blatant disregard

21:33.290 --> 21:34.880
for the man's civil rights.
-That man is a criminal

21:34.880 --> 21:36.710
I apprehended
based on your description.

21:36.710 --> 21:39.460
You're a police officer. Why am
I describing due process to you?

21:39.460 --> 21:41.040
You don't need
to describe anything to me.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.580
Mm-hmm. Three words --
protect and serve.

21:42.580 --> 21:44.290
-Two words -- shut up.
-I'm not gonna shut up.

21:44.290 --> 21:45.920
You do something dumb...
-Oh, wow.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.330
They really
dig each other, huh?

21:48.330 --> 21:50.040
-Are you crazy?
-No, no.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.500
Look how close
they're standing.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.290
-I want to slap you in the face.
-Yeah, you --

21:53.290 --> 21:56.620
My ex and I used to scream
at each other just like that.

21:56.620 --> 21:58.500
It was hot.
-Go ahead. I can take it.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.210
-Huh.
-I'm a witness to that.

22:00.210 --> 22:03.000
Dispatch: Wilshire units,
415 possible assault

22:03.000 --> 22:06.080
at 7293 Citrus, apartment 601.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.790
How much of the job
do you share with your family?

22:07.790 --> 22:10.330
Only because the social aspect
of being a cop

22:10.330 --> 22:12.420
is a vital part
of my education.

22:12.420 --> 22:13.960
I share what I can.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.330
It's a lot easier now that
I'm anchored at the station.

22:16.330 --> 22:18.960
What do you mean,
what you can?

22:18.960 --> 22:21.170
What we do isn't normal,
Officer Nolan.

22:21.170 --> 22:23.670
Situations we find
ourselves in --

22:23.670 --> 22:25.620
Sharing too much can be
counterproductive.

22:25.620 --> 22:27.580
-For them or for you?
-Both.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.250
Here we go.

22:29.250 --> 22:30.830
Oh, it's about time.

22:30.830 --> 22:32.920
It's like World War III
next door.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.000
The arguing,
the fighting.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.670
Ma'am,
I don't hear anything.

22:36.670 --> 22:38.880
Oh, not now.
Probably killed each other.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.380
Okay. We'll check
it out, ma'am.

22:40.380 --> 22:42.040
If you don't mind going
to your apartment, please?

22:43.500 --> 22:44.920
Thank you.

22:51.250 --> 22:52.670
Open up. Police.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.920
You want me
to kick it in?

22:58.920 --> 23:01.000
-Are you saying I can't?
-No.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.580
I mean yes. I --

23:02.580 --> 23:03.790
Step aside.

23:25.210 --> 23:26.460
Wow.

23:28.210 --> 23:30.250
Neighbor wasn't kidding.

23:30.250 --> 23:31.830
Check his pulse.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.040
-Nolan!

24:04.120 --> 24:06.000
Give me your hands!
Hands!

24:06.000 --> 24:07.040
Relax.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.170
What the hell was that?

24:10.170 --> 24:12.000
That's my baby brother, man!

24:17.170 --> 24:19.460
The classes are
the easiest part of college.

24:19.460 --> 24:22.380
It's the other stuff
that's hard to get used to.

24:22.380 --> 24:24.290
Like the fact there's
nobody to do your laundry.

24:24.290 --> 24:25.960
Exactly.

24:25.960 --> 24:29.290
Oh. Independence is
a double-edged sword.

24:29.290 --> 24:31.460
Seriously, though,
if you have any more questions,

24:31.460 --> 24:33.880
I'm happy to give you
the scoop anytime.

24:33.880 --> 24:36.000
I just might
take you up on that.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.710
So, why is it
such a big deal

24:41.710 --> 24:44.040
that your dad's
out riding patrol?

24:46.170 --> 24:49.330
He got shot when
I was in middle school.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.540
Almost died.

24:54.120 --> 24:57.330
Took him a few months
to get back on his feet,

24:57.330 --> 24:59.620
even longer than that
to feel like Dad again.

25:02.170 --> 25:04.880
So, I'm assuming having
our kids see us like this

25:04.880 --> 25:06.710
would be counterproductive?
-Very.

25:06.710 --> 25:08.880
So, we'll just hit the locker
room and get cleaned up first.

25:13.380 --> 25:14.830
Too late.

25:16.710 --> 25:19.500
If I hadn't seen you
like this, would you have
told me about the fight?

25:19.500 --> 25:20.830
Yeah.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.380
No.

25:24.380 --> 25:26.540
Look. It's not a big deal.

25:26.540 --> 25:28.500
It was a little scuffle.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.880
And my job is to protect you
from the bad things,

25:30.880 --> 25:33.000
which includes some of
what I do on the job.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.330
I'm not
a kid anymore, Dad.

25:35.330 --> 25:36.790
I'm going to college
in a few months.

25:36.790 --> 25:38.290
Are you gonna shadow me
across campus?

25:38.290 --> 25:39.830
Don't think I haven't
considered it.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.170
Look, I'm trying. Okay?

25:43.170 --> 25:45.670
But to me,
you're still my baby girl.

25:45.670 --> 25:48.000
No, I'm not, Dad.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
That's just how
you want to see me.

25:53.670 --> 25:56.830
Well, you wanted
to see me in uniform.

25:56.830 --> 25:59.000
Don't.
It's not funny.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.540
You were literally
covered in blood.

26:00.540 --> 26:02.880
Yeah, but
somebody else's blood.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.380
Uh, t-this job, Henry,
i-it's hard to talk about. It --

26:06.380 --> 26:09.290
Harder even than that "birds
and the bees" conversation.

26:09.290 --> 26:11.920
I'm on the outside
of your new life.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.290
Part of it is
because I went to college.

26:14.290 --> 26:16.710
But you're the one
who changed everything.

26:16.710 --> 26:18.710
My whole life growing up,
you got up

26:18.710 --> 26:21.120
and you went to work and
you came home every night,

26:21.120 --> 26:24.620
and I never had to worry
that you wouldn't.

26:24.620 --> 26:27.500
But now you're a cop,
and every time the phone rings,

26:27.500 --> 26:29.330
I panic

26:29.330 --> 26:32.380
and think
something's happened.

26:32.380 --> 26:34.290
Henry, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

26:34.290 --> 26:36.330
Because I haven't
said anything.

26:36.330 --> 26:38.170
Because you're happy

26:38.170 --> 26:41.380
for the first time
in a long time.

26:41.380 --> 26:43.500
Hey, that's not true.
I was happy.

26:43.500 --> 26:44.960
No, you weren't.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.330
The last
few years with Mom,

26:46.330 --> 26:48.500
you both thought
you were protecting me,

26:48.500 --> 26:51.040
but I could feel it.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.170
I hated that I was
the one responsible

26:53.170 --> 26:55.330
for you both
being so miserable.

26:55.330 --> 26:58.170
Hey, now. Your mom and I had
our share of problems,

26:58.170 --> 27:00.290
but we were always on
the same page about you.

27:00.290 --> 27:03.120
You were the one thing
we did right.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.500
Mostly.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.620
Look, h-how about
I change uniforms

27:10.620 --> 27:11.670
and we go
get something to eat?

27:11.670 --> 27:13.290
I'm not hungry.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.750
I shouldn't have ducked.

27:23.750 --> 27:25.500
Relax.
It was instinct.

27:25.500 --> 27:26.830
I should've been
the one to duck.

27:26.830 --> 27:28.290
Guess
I'm a little rusty.

27:28.290 --> 27:29.880
Well, it's understandable.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.830
I mean, you're stuck in
your office most of the day.

27:32.830 --> 27:35.290
Actually, um,
I didn't always push a desk.

27:35.290 --> 27:38.540
You know, I was
in Marine Corps -- MOS 5803.

27:38.540 --> 27:39.920
Military police.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.790
That's where I learned
how to speak Farsi.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.920
Well, I didn't know
you were in the Marines.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.500
I-I thought
that you were just

27:46.500 --> 27:48.080
from another department
back east somewhere.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.750
Did a year
as Pentagon Police,

27:49.750 --> 27:51.750
Criminal Investigation
Directorate.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.750
Then I moved back home --
joined the LAPD.

27:53.750 --> 27:55.580
Moved up quickly
because of my experience,

27:55.580 --> 27:57.670
but that means I didn't
move through the ranks
with these guys,

27:57.670 --> 27:59.750
so they don't see me as a cop,
only as a boss.

27:59.750 --> 28:02.420
You should tell people
about that.

28:02.420 --> 28:05.170
You sure as hell wouldn't have
cops flying in to rescue you.

28:05.170 --> 28:07.500
You don't tell people that
you're a badass, Officer Chen.

28:09.380 --> 28:10.540
Just got to show 'em.

28:10.540 --> 28:11.960
Hey, not
for nothing, lady,

28:11.960 --> 28:14.210
that shiner's pretty badass.
-Shut your mouth.

28:14.210 --> 28:16.750
Don't say anything
without your lawyer present.

28:21.710 --> 28:23.500
You're doing this
to mess with us, right?

28:23.500 --> 28:24.750
The guy robbed you.

28:24.750 --> 28:26.420
Look, the theft
of my briefcase

28:26.420 --> 28:28.170
and the use of force
you used to apprehend him

28:28.170 --> 28:29.670
are two
separate events.

28:29.670 --> 28:31.000
The wonderful thing
about our legal system

28:31.000 --> 28:32.880
is we both have rights.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.170
Whoa.

28:36.170 --> 28:37.750
What?

28:37.750 --> 28:39.580
Captain took
a shot to the face.

28:39.580 --> 28:41.000
All right, all right.
Show's over.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.420
Everybody get back to work.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.120
Thank you.

28:46.330 --> 28:47.830
Bad news?

28:47.830 --> 28:50.880
Uh, no, I just got to get
these stats to the Chief.

28:50.880 --> 28:53.460
You know, actually, um, do you
mind processing our friend

28:53.460 --> 28:55.710
till I get this done,
and then we'll head back out?

28:55.710 --> 28:58.040
Well, I'm fine if you need
to stay here, ma'am.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.460
I've got plenty of paperwork
to do, so...

29:00.460 --> 29:02.210
I appreciate that,
but...

29:02.210 --> 29:04.500
I've made a practice of
finishing what I've started.

29:06.420 --> 29:08.040
You need to go wait out
in the bullpen.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.920
What happened?
I ducked.

29:10.920 --> 29:13.210
-Oh, so he's your client now?
-Until his regular counsel

29:13.210 --> 29:14.920
shows up, yeah.
Is that a problem?

29:14.920 --> 29:16.920
What's going on with
Lopez and that guy?

29:16.920 --> 29:18.710
-Are you okay?
-It's been a weird day.

29:18.710 --> 29:20.830
-You seem very stressed.
-Mm-hmm.

29:22.580 --> 29:23.960
How you doing, Miller?

29:23.960 --> 29:25.880
Can I get
your walk-in reports?

29:25.880 --> 29:27.330
I got to update
the stat sheets.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.380
I got a question.

29:30.380 --> 29:31.960
Somebody will be with you
in just a minute.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.120
I need some information
regarding prison sentencing.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.750
What's your question?

29:37.750 --> 29:39.290
How much prison time
for a bar fight?

29:41.290 --> 29:43.540
Depends on the severity
of the, uh, injuries

29:43.540 --> 29:45.580
and your previous record.
Why are you asking?

29:45.580 --> 29:47.620
Is murder really the only
guarantee for a life sentence?

29:50.040 --> 29:51.460
Just get out?

29:51.460 --> 29:52.880
Yeah, couple weeks ago.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.830
Let me guess.
You were in there a long time.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.920
You having trouble, uh,
adjusting on the outside?

30:00.120 --> 30:02.250
Nah.

30:02.250 --> 30:05.120
I'm good. I'm good.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.250
You walk into a police station
asking questions about murder,

30:07.250 --> 30:08.670
you most certainly
are not good.

30:08.670 --> 30:10.500
I strongly advise you
not to do anything stupid.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.210
Don't worry about it.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.580
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

30:13.580 --> 30:15.790
Let me see your hands!

30:17.620 --> 30:19.040
I kill her,

30:19.040 --> 30:21.420
I go back inside
forever.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.420
Man: He's got a gun!

30:26.080 --> 30:28.210
-I'll kill her.
-All right.

30:28.210 --> 30:29.580
-Look at me. Hey, hey!

30:29.580 --> 30:31.620
You don't want to do this.
You don't have to do this.

30:31.620 --> 30:33.750
I told you.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.210
I'll do anything
to go back inside.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.790
Trust me,
you're going back in.

30:36.790 --> 30:38.170
I'm not looking
to do a short fall.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.750
I can't handle it
out here.

30:41.750 --> 30:43.960
Okay. I get that,
I get that.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.830
You got a little
too much freedom.

30:45.830 --> 30:47.710
I felt the exact same way
after I left the Corps.

30:47.710 --> 30:49.290
Used to being told
where to go,

30:49.290 --> 30:51.710
what to do, when to eat,
when to sleep. Come on.

30:51.710 --> 30:53.420
She shouldn't have
to suffer 'cause you're
going through a crisis.

30:53.420 --> 30:54.920
She didn't sign up for that.
Put the gun down.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.080
Bitch, I don't care
what she signed up for.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.790
You pull that trigger, I
got half a dozen cops who
are gonna light you up,

30:59.790 --> 31:02.170
and I know you don't want that.
-Shut up!

31:02.170 --> 31:03.920
Okay. Okay.

31:05.210 --> 31:07.420
I just -- I have one more --
one more question.

31:09.540 --> 31:11.120
In your previous crimes,
did you...

31:12.460 --> 31:13.500
...use a gun?

31:13.500 --> 31:15.330
What? Why?

31:16.790 --> 31:18.210
You got
your safety on.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.830
-Get her!
-Come on, come on.

31:22.830 --> 31:26.040
-Get the gun.
-I got it, Captain.

31:26.040 --> 31:29.330
-Turn him over!

31:29.330 --> 31:31.040
-Holy crap.
-What?

31:31.040 --> 31:33.960
It's a Glock.
There's no external safety.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.670
You charged
a live weapon.

31:35.670 --> 31:37.670
Told you Captain
could take care of herself.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.500
Tim: What the hell
happened here?
Oh, my --

31:42.500 --> 31:44.710
Um, did you
get skunked?

31:48.710 --> 31:50.210
Nolan:
I don't know what to do.

31:50.210 --> 31:52.500
You should've seen
the look on his face.

31:52.500 --> 31:55.460
Trust me. I saw
a version of it in my office.

31:55.460 --> 31:57.670
At least your daughter has
lived with this her whole life.

31:57.670 --> 32:00.290
I mean, I just threw Henry
into the deep end. I had no...

32:02.000 --> 32:05.250
I never thought once about how
my choice was gonna affect him.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.170
It was so much easier
when she was younger.

32:07.170 --> 32:09.170
Tell me about it.

32:11.750 --> 32:13.250
Let this be
our one and only

32:13.250 --> 32:15.920
heart-to-heart moment,
Officer Nolan.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.040
John.

32:18.960 --> 32:20.880
Officer Nolan
is fine.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.790
Yeah.

32:24.920 --> 32:26.210
What the hell was that?

32:26.210 --> 32:28.750
7-Adam-15,
explosion on Walton

32:28.750 --> 32:30.040
between 29th and 30th.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.540
Need backup, airship,
RA, LAFD.

32:32.540 --> 32:33.580
Send the works.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.170
-That's gas.
-Looks like the main's blown.

32:47.170 --> 32:49.210
Probably venting
into that house.

32:49.210 --> 32:50.750
You all right?

32:50.750 --> 32:52.500
Is there anybody
left inside?

32:52.500 --> 32:55.500
-Yeah.
-Sir.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.080
Sgt. Grey:
Hey, Nolan, without a mask,

32:57.080 --> 32:58.540
you won't
make it 10 steps.

32:58.540 --> 33:01.290
You okay?
You got him? Thank you.

33:08.330 --> 33:09.380
Give me one.

33:09.380 --> 33:10.710

35:59.000 --> 36:01.750
No more complaints.
I promise.

36:01.750 --> 36:04.120

This feels like another thing
you're trying to blame on me.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.210
Not at all.
No, I like renting an office

36:15.210 --> 36:17.500
above
an Ethiopian restaurant.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.040
Look, I'm scrappy, okay?

36:19.040 --> 36:21.460
I really love

But...

36:23.120 --> 36:25.290
today, my tenacity...

36:25.290 --> 36:26.330
it clouded my judgment.

36:26.330 --> 36:27.960
Are you trying
to argue an apology?

36:27.960 --> 36:29.000
No. I'm sorry.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.830
You were trying to help me,

36:30.830 --> 36:32.040
even though you really
didn't want to,

36:32.040 --> 36:34.540

36:34.540 --> 36:37.080

my briefcase back.

36:52.790 --> 36:54.880
No, a nice suit.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.830
Yeah. Why?

36:56.830 --> 36:59.830
I need a date for my brother's
