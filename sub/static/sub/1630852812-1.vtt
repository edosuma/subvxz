01:29.720 --> 01:31.280
Bugger.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.920
Oi!

03:16.920 --> 03:19.000
That bike belongs to a copper.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.280
How about you mind
your own business.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.280
And he's still not had
his first coffee.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.720
Detective Inspector Max Arnold.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.040
Give me those.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.600
Right.
Stand there.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.200
What you doing, bruv?

03:34.200 --> 03:35.640
You can't just take pictures
of me, mate.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.200
What's your name?

03:38.200 --> 03:39.760
- Jake.
- Jake what?

03:39.760 --> 03:42.120
Turner.
Are you gonna nick me or what?

03:42.120 --> 03:44.840
I'd prefer to avoid
any unnecessary paperwork.

03:44.840 --> 03:48.080
Well, Mr. Turner,
you owe me a new bike lock,

03:48.080 --> 03:49.960
which you can drop off
at Chelsea nick

03:49.960 --> 03:53.640
at your earliest convenience.

03:53.640 --> 03:56.520
Off you go then.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.480
And I mean new.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.640
With a receipt.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.840
As in not bloody nicked!

06:30.920 --> 06:32.680
Like and share, like and share.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.200
Aw, mate!
What you doing?

06:38.200 --> 06:40.200
The wages of sin...
is death.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.960
The wages of sin...
is death.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.040
Get off.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.640
The wages of sin...
is death.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.200
Jog on.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.920
Please stand back
from your platform of choice.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.200
Excuse me! DI Arnold.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.120
Darren Goldfinch,
Chelsea Online News.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.400
Is it true a passenger
was pushed onto the line?

08:10.400 --> 08:12.960
Rumor is we could have
a mad pusher on the loose.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.160
No. That is not true.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.720
Could it be?
Just give me something.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.200
Huff Post are interested.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.640
- Morning, Sir.
- Morning.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.240
Make sure nobody nicks that,
will you?

08:22.240 --> 08:23.800
DI Arnold...

08:31.760 --> 08:34.240
Detective Inspector Arnold.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.200
You did know
I was back today, right?

08:36.200 --> 08:38.880
Did I?

08:38.880 --> 08:40.960
How is it?

08:40.960 --> 08:42.600
By "it", you mean my child?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.920
Motherhood.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.760
Uh, girl, right?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.200
On account of
the pink teddy bear?

08:49.200 --> 08:50.600
Thanks for that, by the way.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.200
Don't tell me.
A flower.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.880
I'm picturing a flower...

08:53.880 --> 08:54.920
Lupin?

08:54.920 --> 08:57.240
Who calls their child Lupin?

08:57.240 --> 09:00.520
- Poppy.
- Poppy.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.280
She's got your eyes.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.640
Beady.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.600
Sorry to hear about your dad.

09:07.600 --> 09:11.080
How have you been?

09:11.080 --> 09:15.240
And, dare I ask.
you and Astrid?

09:16.720 --> 09:19.360
Oh God, Max, you're not still on
that smelly boat, are you?

09:19.360 --> 09:21.400
I might be.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.200
Did we get anything
from eyewitnesses?

09:23.200 --> 09:24.240
She thinks he was pushed.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.200
What did the driver say?

09:26.200 --> 09:28.880
He said he jumped.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.080
Less paperwork if he jumped.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.720
I'm Detective Inspector
Max Arnold.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.920
Please.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.200
You told one of my officers you
believed the victim was pushed?

09:39.200 --> 09:41.280
That's how it looked
at the time.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.400
Did you see who pushed him?

09:43.400 --> 09:45.960
But thinking about it now,

09:45.960 --> 09:48.360
it's more like he jumped.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.880
It all happened so fast.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.520
Or fell.

09:54.520 --> 09:58.360
I think actually he fell.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.440
He looks unsteady on his feet.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.040
That busker's not happy.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.280
Do you think he made
his way down on to the platform

10:25.280 --> 10:28.400
to give him a shove?

10:28.400 --> 10:30.960
Depends on the type of coffee
that was spilled.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.800
World's first
coffee-related murder.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.360
Not the last.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.760
I can't see a push.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.520
It looks like he falls.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.560
Or jumps.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.360
We need the footage
from the driver's cab.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.480
How'd you know I spoke to him?

11:11.480 --> 11:15.280
Right, right, always watching.

11:15.280 --> 11:18.200
You took a break shortly after.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.280
Yeah, in that direction.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.000
I went to get a refill.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.400
Oh, where'd you get your coffee?

11:22.400 --> 11:24.200
From a van around the corner.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.400
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.760
Excuse me.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.360
Can he do that?

11:28.360 --> 11:30.240
What did the victim say to you?

11:33.160 --> 11:35.600
Not "sorry," I can tell you
that much.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.040
Something about sin.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.840
The wages of sin is death.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.880
Are you sure?

11:41.880 --> 11:43.600
Yeah, it was weird.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.400
Did he smell of alcohol?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.080
No, but he --
he was slurring his words.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.240
Morning, Ashley.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.520
Excuse me. Is she on?

12:05.520 --> 12:06.920
I'll just go check.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.800
Morning.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.200
- Morning.
- Morning.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.040
Hold on.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.760
Wait for the beep.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.040
Speak.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.400
Any ID?

12:27.400 --> 12:31.120
Victim is Andrew Knightley,
62 years old,

12:31.120 --> 12:34.920
formerly of 72 Denton Crescent.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.920
Amazing what you find
down here.

12:36.920 --> 12:40.880
Coins, various denominations,
a gym membership card,

12:40.880 --> 12:45.360
expired April 2016,
a false nail -- pink --

12:45.360 --> 12:49.200
a button --
white with a blue ripple.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.080
Did you find his phone?

12:51.080 --> 12:54.200
Just his keys, wallet,
and oyster card so far.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.000
Is he one of yours?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.120
Oi! Can you stop!

12:59.120 --> 13:01.560
- I said stop filming!
- Hey!

13:03.880 --> 13:06.000
How the hell did he end up
on the platform?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.680
I don't know.
Nobody's got past me.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.600
Oh, well, clearly he did!

13:09.600 --> 13:11.680
Can I have my phone back?

13:11.680 --> 13:12.800
How did you get in?

13:12.800 --> 13:14.360
Invisibility cloak.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.880
It's locked. Face ID.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.200
Invisi-bility.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.720
How'd you spell that?

13:22.720 --> 13:24.920
- Is it all I's?
- Are you allowed to do that?

13:24.920 --> 13:28.200
Oh, deleted!

13:28.200 --> 13:29.920
Thank you, Mr. Hewitt.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.480
Venting at a colleague.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.840
Is everything alright?

13:39.840 --> 13:42.640
The kid, the new baby,
new mum thing...

13:42.640 --> 13:44.440
Okay, these are just
random words.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.840
Sleepless nights.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.400
Oh, I think he's asking
if I'm tired.

13:48.400 --> 13:54.000
No, he's concerned why you came
back to work three months early.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.640
Are you and Astrid
still speaking?

13:55.640 --> 13:57.040
Oh, you're deflecting.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.600
We're having a custody battle.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.760
Over what?

14:02.760 --> 14:04.600
My coffee machine.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.480
Astrid bought it for me,
so it's mine.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.040
She doesn't even drink coffee,
for God sake.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.840
Okay, great.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.240
Good to know you've been coping.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.240
Connor. Jess.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.200
- Morning, boss.
- Morning, boss.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.720
- Look busy.
- Hey.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.480
- What are you doing back? Hello.
- Congratulations.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.960
Welcome back.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.520
Um, I've got the footage
from the driver's cab.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.000
- Oh.
- Connor?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.440
Where are we on locating
the victim's next of kin?

14:50.440 --> 14:52.600
The daughter's on holiday
in Tenerife.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.800
I left a message with the hotel.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.800
A message?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.320
I'm chasing.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.480
Okay.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.920
Right, there's our man.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.920
Does that look like a push?

15:14.400 --> 15:17.280
Maybe he trips,
loses his balance.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.440
Hello.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.920
Is that an arm?

15:32.760 --> 15:35.400
- Pushed.
- Oh, definitely.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.520
Start collating everything you
can find on Andrew Knightley.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.680
Hey, Pri, welcome back.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.360
Any baby photos?

15:49.360 --> 15:51.960
Um, later.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.240
Did they call you back early?

15:53.240 --> 15:55.720
That's a bit out of order.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.400
I'm fine.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.360
I'm fine.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.000
Okay.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.200
No, Max,
I don't want you round my flat

16:25.200 --> 16:27.520
with your screwdriver
taking it apart.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.760
Oh, your flat now, is it?

16:29.760 --> 16:32.680
Since you left, yeah!

16:32.680 --> 16:34.520
- Asti --
- Astrid.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.720
Asti, how do you know
it's broken?

16:36.720 --> 16:38.680
You don't even drink coffee.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.520
No, but my guests do.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.280
It's probably just the fuse.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.400
Wait, you have guests?

16:43.400 --> 16:44.640
What guests?

16:44.640 --> 16:46.200
Goodbye, Max.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.920
There -- you talked to her.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.480
You feel better now?

17:03.000 --> 17:06.600
Upstairs neighbor said
last Tuesday night,

17:06.600 --> 17:09.200
he heard a loud sobbing
and moaning.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.200
- From this flat?
- Hmm.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.160
He said he asked him
about it the next morning.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.760
And Andrew Knightley
was mortified.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.560
Said he got carried away
"praying."

17:29.960 --> 17:32.200
What's his family situation?

17:32.200 --> 17:34.520
Neighbor said he lived
alone since his wife died

17:34.520 --> 17:36.040
six months ago.

17:54.280 --> 17:57.240
Bank statements.

17:57.240 --> 18:01.240
An invoice for
Brompton Stonemasonry.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.320
Proprietor, Andrew Knightley.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Letters from his GP.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.480
This one from last week.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.880
"Saw Mr. Knightley...

18:13.880 --> 18:16.920
complaining of dizzy spells."

18:16.920 --> 18:20.400
He's been referred for
a thyroid test and an MRI.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.960
Maybe he was ill.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.680
Place is spotless,
but he's missed a bit here.

18:41.240 --> 18:45.240
He was unsteady on his feet,
slurring his words,

18:45.240 --> 18:47.920
but there's no alcohol
in the cupboards.

18:47.920 --> 18:51.480
No empties in the recycling.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.080
You checked the bathroom
for pills?

18:53.080 --> 18:55.120
Yeah. Nothing stronger
than paracetamol.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.760
This isn't really about
the coffee machine, is it?

19:02.760 --> 19:06.680
Unless it is, in which case
I'll just buy you a new one.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.880
How much was it?

19:07.880 --> 19:09.920
About £500.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.640
I know, I know.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.960
For my 40th,
Nitin bought me a terrarium.

19:15.960 --> 19:20.000
It's the height of romance --
a cactus and a jar of dirt.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.080
Hello.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.240
A spy camera?

19:28.240 --> 19:30.280
Yeah, but what's it doing
in the bin?

19:31.440 --> 19:33.440
It's not broken.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.920
Looks like
it's motion-activated.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.600
You got a pen?

19:46.200 --> 19:48.200
However did you cope
without me, Max?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.600
Andrew Knightley's tox samples,
blood and urine,

20:40.600 --> 20:43.400
showed traces
of a synthetic opioid.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.360
We checked with the GP and
he wasn't been prescribed them.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.960
He was using?

20:47.960 --> 20:50.680
It's possible he wasn't aware
he been taking it.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.440
But from the opiod metaboloid
present,

20:52.440 --> 20:55.720
it looks like he'd been
ingesting it for a while.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.880
What do you mean
he wasn't aware?

20:57.880 --> 21:00.320
We didn't find any opioids
in his house.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.960
But I did.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.960
There were traces
in the stomach contents,

21:09.960 --> 21:11.440
so I requested further tests

21:11.440 --> 21:14.400
on foodstuffs
from the victim's kitchen.

21:14.400 --> 21:18.200
Milk and sugar samples
where contaminated.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.920
Someone was drugging him?

21:19.920 --> 21:21.960
Someone was doing
more than that.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.080
Contact burns.

21:27.080 --> 21:31.480
See this discoloration across
his shoulders and upper back?

21:31.480 --> 21:35.960
They're healing, but
probably less than a week old.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.600
Circular, but blistering
in different sizes.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.920
Not cigarette burns.

21:40.920 --> 21:43.440
They look more like
a drip pattern,

21:43.440 --> 21:45.040
possibly oil-based.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.360
What did that neighbor say?

21:50.360 --> 21:53.000
Moaning. Sobbing. Praying.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.880
A spot of Tuesday-night
flagellation.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.240
There's one more thing.

22:00.680 --> 22:04.160
From his medical history...

22:04.160 --> 22:07.400
there's an old fracture
of the right humerus.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.480
Well healed, at least 5
to 10 years old.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.880
But hard to spot clinically.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.600
There's barely any malunion.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.200
Which means?

22:17.200 --> 22:19.520
Which means it's been treated,

22:19.520 --> 22:22.240
so should be on
his medical records,

22:22.240 --> 22:23.480
and it's not.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.960
Boss, cyber boys uploaded
the data dump

22:35.960 --> 22:37.520
from Andrew Knightley's laptop.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.760
Cyber boys?

22:38.760 --> 22:40.160
No social media presence,

22:40.160 --> 22:42.960
but his search history
is interesting.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.640
Oh, and front desk said

22:44.640 --> 22:48.400
some young bloke
dropped that off for you.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.040
Thank you.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.160
"Ghosts," "Ghost writing,"

23:06.160 --> 23:09.360
"Reincarnation,"
"Automatic writing."

23:12.600 --> 23:14.040
Gabriella Tottenham?

23:16.440 --> 23:18.200
He searched genealogy sites too,

23:18.200 --> 23:20.120
so maybe building
his family tree.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.760
Financial background checks
on Andrew Knightley.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.640
Recent transactions
cross-referenced

23:24.640 --> 23:27.000
with receipts
found in his wallet.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.720
Two items of jewelry --
a necklace and earrings --

23:29.720 --> 23:32.680
bought a week apart,
on the 18th and the 25th.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.240
Not cheap, either.

23:34.240 --> 23:37.680
And he withdrew 500 quid
two days ago.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.520
He didn't have any cash on him.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.840
You checked this against
the inventory from his flat?

23:42.840 --> 23:44.200
No cash or jewelry there.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.160
Phone company sent
through his texts.

23:46.160 --> 23:49.400
He averaged single-number texts
per week, but...

23:49.400 --> 23:53.120
outgoing, 21:05 the night
before he died.

23:53.120 --> 23:56.760
"There is an evil in my home.
Can you help me?"

23:56.760 --> 23:58.680
I've called the number,
left a message.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.880
Requesting a trace.

24:00.880 --> 24:03.640
And when was the last ping
from Knightley's phone?

24:03.640 --> 24:07.880
Uh, oh, 7:55 outside
South Ken station.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.640
So presumably he had his phone
on him when he died.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.200
But it hasn't been
recovered yet.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.760
Um, you might wanna see this.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.400
Photos pulled from
Knightley's laptop.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.200
There's four in total.

24:23.200 --> 24:27.200
"He that hath mercy on the poor
lendeth to the Lord

24:27.200 --> 24:31.000
and he will repay him."

24:31.000 --> 24:33.640
"Do not forget to do good,
and to impart,

24:33.640 --> 24:37.440
for by such sacrifices
God's favor is obtained."

24:37.440 --> 24:40.600
"How gracious and compassionate
is our Lord."

24:40.600 --> 24:43.640
"The unrighteous shall not
possess the kingdom of God.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.200
Do not err."

24:45.200 --> 24:47.360
The last one
was taken six days ago.

25:01.320 --> 25:03.200
<i>I've traced</i> <i>
the victim's last text.</i>

25:03.200 --> 25:05.920
<i>It was sent to an Erin Murphy.</i>

25:05.920 --> 25:08.440
She's the chapel warden
at Brompton Cemetery.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.080
<i>Okay. Thanks, Jess.</i>

25:13.600 --> 25:16.200
Emmeline Pankhurst
famously buried here,

25:16.200 --> 25:18.000
but what age was she

25:18.000 --> 25:19.800
when she joined
the suffrage movement?

25:19.800 --> 25:23.400
Was it 14, 18, or 21?

25:23.400 --> 25:24.600
18?

25:24.600 --> 25:26.800
It was 14!

25:26.800 --> 25:28.400
Emmeline was 14

25:28.400 --> 25:29.960
when she joined
the suffrage movement.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.040
Right, everyone come on.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.680
Through there.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.200
Come on, let's keep it going.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.680
That's it.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.400
"An evil in my home."

25:47.400 --> 25:48.960
I had no idea what he meant.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.240
You didn't respond?

25:50.240 --> 25:52.240
No.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.960
Thank you.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.920
I was going to ask him about it
yesterday morning.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.680
You and he had planned to meet?

25:58.680 --> 26:01.440
Most mornings, he's in
the chapel when I arrive.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.720
Is that a new habit?

26:02.720 --> 26:04.360
The frequency is.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.880
It's been almost daily
for the past month.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.000
I did wonder if he was ill.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.560
He looked pale.

26:14.360 --> 26:16.960
Have you ever been
in Andrew's flat?

26:16.960 --> 26:18.480
No.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.280
Where were you
at 8:00 AM yesterday?

26:21.280 --> 26:24.600
Dropping my husband
at Saint Pancras.

26:24.600 --> 26:27.240
We found some writing on a
mirror in Mr. Knightley's home.

26:27.240 --> 26:30.960
Four in total,
over the last four weeks.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.960
Did he write them?

26:32.960 --> 26:35.520
Not from our
handwriting analysis.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.520
Does anything stand out?

26:37.520 --> 26:40.960
Beyond it being a threat?

26:40.960 --> 26:44.400
Proverbs, Hebrews...

26:44.400 --> 26:46.240
That one's Psalms.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.400
Corinthians.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.760
But the language?

26:48.760 --> 26:51.920
Um, is it standard King James?

26:51.920 --> 26:53.040
One moment, please.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.600
"Ghost writing"?

27:06.600 --> 27:08.200
"Reincarnation."

27:08.200 --> 27:09.440
I mean, he worked in a cemetery,

27:09.440 --> 27:12.360
maybe something
followed him home.

27:12.360 --> 27:13.920
I'm joking, Max.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.200
I'm sorry.
Is your father buried here?

27:21.200 --> 27:23.720
I'm so sorry.

27:23.720 --> 27:25.960
Is that Davinson Clarke?

27:31.120 --> 27:34.640
Mrs. Murphy, do you know
that man?

27:34.640 --> 27:36.680
Davinson? Yes.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.200
And I know all about his past.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.880
I volunteer at a place
that helps people

27:40.880 --> 27:42.680
like Davinson
get back into work.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.200
Ex-cons?

27:44.200 --> 27:46.400
People who've fallen
on hard times.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.960
I don't judge.

27:50.640 --> 27:54.200
Any history between Davinson
and Andrew Knightley?

27:54.200 --> 27:56.840
You'd have to ask him.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.240
Now, they're from
the Douay Rheims translation.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.760
It's Catholic. Traditionalist.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.240
Quite common.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.600
But this one,
this is truncated.

28:04.600 --> 28:08.720
The full quote is "Know you not
that the unrighteous

28:08.720 --> 28:11.400
shall not possess
the kingdom of God.

28:11.400 --> 28:15.640
Do not err, neither fornicators,
nor idolaters, nor adulterers."

28:15.640 --> 28:17.920
Wow, hard to fit all that
on a mirror.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.720
Think he'll remember us?

28:27.960 --> 28:30.520
Mr. Clarke!

28:53.040 --> 28:54.960
This is DI Arnold.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.440
Any units near
Brompton cemetery?

28:57.440 --> 29:00.040
Chasing a suspect on foot
towards the Fulham Road.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.120
Davinson Clarke.
Advise caution.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.960
He's got previous for GBH
and aggravated robbery.

29:10.760 --> 29:14.200
I think he remembered us.

29:14.200 --> 29:17.400
Aww, it's been ages
since I've had a stitch.

29:17.400 --> 29:21.200
Well, you've just -- you know.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.360
Yeah, I know.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.240
Hiya.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.680
I've just started working
on the head.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.880
Excuse me.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.080
I'm Detective Inspector
Max Arnold.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.880
This is Detective Sergeant
Priya Shamsie.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.480
Are you Hayley Donohue?

29:46.480 --> 29:48.400
Yeah.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.680
We're investigating an incident
at South Kensington tube station

29:51.680 --> 29:53.400
yesterday morning,

29:53.400 --> 29:56.000
which resulted in the death
of Mr. Andrew Knightley.

29:59.480 --> 30:00.760
What happened?

30:00.760 --> 30:03.920
He was hit by a tube train.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.040
I'm sorry, we do have to
ask some questions.

30:09.480 --> 30:11.040
Hayley?

30:20.200 --> 30:21.720
Okay, okay.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.960
Alright.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.520
Stay still.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.720
It's so impressive.

30:41.720 --> 30:43.200
Thanks.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.480
We were supposed to build it
together,

30:44.480 --> 30:46.760
but it's all my own work.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.880
Andrew kept avoiding it.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.200
Why's that?

30:50.200 --> 30:53.200
He just hated doing it.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.680
Have you worked together long?

30:55.680 --> 30:57.640
Coming up to two years.

30:57.640 --> 30:58.920
I started here on
an apprenticeship

30:58.920 --> 31:01.200
and then Andrew kept me on.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.200
He was a good boss.

31:03.200 --> 31:06.080
There. It's not deep.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.400
You might need a tetanus shot
if you're not up to date.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.320
Thanks.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.840
Can you tell us anything
about Andrew's personal life?

31:20.840 --> 31:23.240
You know he was widowed
last year?

31:23.240 --> 31:25.120
Did he have a current partner?

31:25.120 --> 31:29.840
No, he was
the married-for-life type.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.960
He recently bought
some jewelry.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.920
A necklace and some earrings.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.960
That was for
his daughter's birthday.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.520
I helped him choose them.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.440
What's this?

31:47.080 --> 31:48.200
Charity barbecue a while back

31:48.200 --> 31:50.000
that Andrew roped me
in to help at.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.720
He donated all the food.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.400
Was Andrew friendly
with Davinson Clarke?

31:56.400 --> 32:00.160
Sure. Davinson helps us
prep the plots.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.720
You and Mr. Knightley
look close.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.640
We were, I suppose,
but he's my boss,

32:04.640 --> 32:06.640
so I had to laugh at his jokes.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.040
I know how that goes.

32:11.040 --> 32:14.440
Did you socialize
outside of work?

32:14.440 --> 32:16.640
Me and Andrew?

32:16.640 --> 32:18.400
No.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.680
Did you go to his house?

32:20.680 --> 32:22.400
No.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.200
Could we take a sample
of your handwriting?

32:25.200 --> 32:27.200
What for?

32:27.200 --> 32:28.800
Elimination purposes.

32:31.640 --> 32:32.840
What should I write?

32:32.840 --> 32:37.080
The whatsit fox
and the lazy dog?

32:37.080 --> 32:40.720
How about "The Lord is Gracious
and Merciful."

32:44.880 --> 32:47.280
"The Lord

32:47.280 --> 32:49.880
is Gracious

32:49.880 --> 32:53.040
and Merciful."

32:59.440 --> 33:04.200
Is this about the messages --
the ones on his mirror?

33:04.200 --> 33:05.680
Mr. Knightley told you
about those?

33:05.680 --> 33:07.160
Oh. Did he.

33:07.160 --> 33:09.200
He showed me a photo of one
on his phone.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.200
"Messages from his ghost,"
he told me.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.280
He was hoaxing it, right?

33:21.520 --> 33:23.080
Oh...

33:25.480 --> 33:28.400
Do you have any other samples
of your writing to compare?

33:28.400 --> 33:30.360
Seeing as you already knew
about those.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.600
Thank you.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.840
We also found a video camera
in Mr. Knightley's home.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.000
Do you know about that?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.400
No.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.720
Maybe he was trying
to film his ghost.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.360
Okay.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.480
Put some officers
outside the suspect's flat.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.920
There's no sign
of Davinson Clarke.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.600
Oh, are we taking the tour?

34:12.600 --> 34:14.240
Had a gut feeling
about that tour guide.

34:14.240 --> 34:16.360
He was watching us like a hawk.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.880
Is there a number we can call?

34:18.880 --> 34:20.520
A-ha!

34:20.520 --> 34:22.840
CHIPS.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.880
The Chelsea Historical
Preservation Society.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.200
It's my aunt's passion.

34:32.240 --> 34:33.680
Hello, stranger.

34:33.680 --> 34:34.920
Morning.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.440
You remember my partner, Priya?

34:37.440 --> 34:39.040
Partner?

34:39.040 --> 34:41.480
Ah, as in copper.
Well, obviously.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.400
'Cause you're way
out of his league.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.680
I called Simon.
He's on his way.

34:44.680 --> 34:47.000
Come through.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.560
I love your aunt.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.400
It's our most popular tour.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.760
Simon used to be an actor.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.680
Still am an actor, Livvy,
and a writer.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.680
Playwright.

35:01.680 --> 35:04.200
How well did you know
Andrew Knightley?

35:04.200 --> 35:06.880
Only to chat about the weather.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.160
The reason I was staring...

35:09.160 --> 35:12.400
I was plucking up the courage
to come over.

35:12.400 --> 35:15.800
I might have some information
about the groundsman.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.880
Go on.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.960
Must've been two days ago.

35:22.960 --> 35:27.240
I saw Andrew Knightley
give Davinson some money.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.600
It looked like a lot
of cash too.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.480
I've heard people say
that Davinson's the man

35:32.480 --> 35:37.200
to speak to if you want --
you know.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.240
What?

35:39.240 --> 35:40.800
Drugs.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.680
And did you see an exchange?

35:45.680 --> 35:48.840
No.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.520
Well, when Mr. Clarke turns up,
we'll ask him.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.000
I'm late for rehearsals.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.480
Is there anything else
you need from me?

35:57.480 --> 35:59.880
We'd like a sample
of your writing.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.400
You wanna read my play?

36:02.400 --> 36:06.120
Your handwriting.

36:06.120 --> 36:09.240
Can you write out
the following sentence, please?

36:09.240 --> 36:13.680
Um, "The unrighteous shall not
possess the kingdom of God."

36:15.640 --> 36:17.360
Why do you need that?

36:17.360 --> 36:19.400
Just collecting writing samples
of everyone

36:19.400 --> 36:22.960
who had contact
with Andrew Knightley.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.720
This is going to the library?

36:24.720 --> 36:26.240
It's first edition.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.400
Doesn't want to help,
but keen to interfere.

36:28.400 --> 36:29.960
Just like his father.

36:41.920 --> 36:45.360
That's fine. Thanks.

36:45.360 --> 36:48.640
Thank God for spellcheckers.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.480
Where were you yesterday
at 8:00 AM?

36:50.480 --> 36:53.200
I was here.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.400
What were you doing here?

36:55.400 --> 36:56.440
I'm staying here.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.080
It's only for a couple of weeks.

36:58.080 --> 37:01.240
Just while his flat's
being decorated.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.520
Sorry, I really do need to go.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.720
Is that okay?

37:03.720 --> 37:05.720
Uh, yeah.

37:05.720 --> 37:09.760
If we have any more questions,
we know where to find you.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.320
Don't wait up, Livvy.

37:27.360 --> 37:30.000
I don't like him.
He's shifty.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.400
- He's good company.
- How well do you know him?

37:32.400 --> 37:36.440
I've been friends with his mum
since forever.

37:36.440 --> 37:39.480
Oh, Max, your police antenna
makes you think

37:39.480 --> 37:41.480
everybody's shifty.

37:49.680 --> 37:52.400
You know, intergenerational
relationships are

37:52.400 --> 37:54.520
far more common
than you think.

37:54.520 --> 37:58.400
Mr. Simon Turnbull
is not my aunt's type.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.040
- Oh?
- Trust me.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.960
Oh.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.480
Okay.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.200
I get it.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.000
Yes, absolutely.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.760
No. No, it's not a problem.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.400
Yeah.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.240
Uh, can I just call you back?

42:15.240 --> 42:16.880
Thank you.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.640
Hey.
Dinner's in the microwave.

42:19.640 --> 42:21.400
Did you jog home?

42:21.400 --> 42:23.120
- I went to the track.
- It's good timing.

42:23.120 --> 42:25.360
Do you remember Jo Lyndsey?
She was covering for me.

42:25.360 --> 42:26.640
She just called.
They need me to review

42:26.640 --> 42:28.440
the Itsu campaign
before it goes out.

42:28.440 --> 42:31.040
- Could you...?
- I need to shower and eat.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.840
Congratulations, Asti.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.760
I bet you broke it on purpose.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.680
- Boss.
- Oh.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.040
Check your e-mail.

44:24.360 --> 44:26.200
Where did these come from?

44:26.200 --> 44:27.680
There's a new one.

44:27.680 --> 44:30.480
"The wages of sin is death."

44:30.480 --> 44:32.400
When was this taken?

44:32.400 --> 44:35.440
Says in the copy
it was the morning he died.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.640
Chelsea Online News.

44:37.640 --> 44:41.000
That reporter at South Ken tube.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.080
Um, Darren Bullfinch, Goldcrest.

44:44.080 --> 44:46.200
The site's owned by
a Darren Goldfinch.

44:46.200 --> 44:48.400
That's him.
Find his contact details.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.760
I want to know how he got
these pictures.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.200
Will do.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.520
Was it just these photos?

45:07.520 --> 45:09.520
Or were there others?

45:09.520 --> 45:10.600
Just these.

45:10.600 --> 45:11.880
How'd you come by them?

45:11.880 --> 45:13.440
An anonymous source.

45:13.440 --> 45:15.040
Arrived in the post
this morning, an envelope,

45:15.040 --> 45:16.720
with a USB stick inside.

45:16.720 --> 45:19.480
- Do you still have the envelope?
- No, I recycled it.

45:19.480 --> 45:21.840
- What about the USB stick?
- It's somewhere.

45:21.840 --> 45:25.040
Was the address handwritten
or printed?

45:25.040 --> 45:27.400
I don't remember.

45:27.400 --> 45:30.600
As of this morning,
5,000 hits and counting.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.080
You normally get
less than 1,000 a week.

45:33.880 --> 45:35.880
If I was you, I'd stretch this
out a bit longer too.

45:35.880 --> 45:38.920
That's not what I'm doing.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.360
I'll write you a receipt
for this.

45:40.360 --> 45:41.920
No, no, I need that for work.

46:04.480 --> 46:06.400
Look, um...

46:06.400 --> 46:08.480
Good journalists need
to protect their sources.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.000
Fine. Fine.
It wasn't on a USB stick.

46:16.000 --> 46:21.680
It was a WeTransfer link
from 1990superNH@protonmail.com.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.160
Proton Mail is --

46:23.160 --> 46:24.520
Yeah,
we know what Proton mail is.

46:24.520 --> 46:30.760
Could "NH" be initials
and 1990 date of birth?

46:30.760 --> 46:32.280
Didn't think to ask.

46:32.280 --> 46:33.960
A good journalist would ask.

46:37.640 --> 46:39.400
You said at the start
I haven't been arrested?

46:39.400 --> 46:40.760
That's correct.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.240
So I'm free to
terminate this interview

46:42.240 --> 46:43.440
and leave at any time?

46:43.440 --> 46:45.000
Thank you, Mr. Goldfinch.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.040
Proton Mail is an end-to-end
encrypted e-mail service.

46:59.760 --> 47:02.040
Hello, Poppy!

47:02.040 --> 47:04.600
Say hello. Say hello.

47:04.600 --> 47:05.760
Am I on mute?

47:05.760 --> 47:07.240
Oh, she's smiling now. Look.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.200
<i>Oh, let me see!</i>

47:09.200 --> 47:11.600
Oh, hold on, hold on.

47:11.600 --> 47:15.000
It was a lot easier to lie
before FaceTime, Nitin.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.440
<i>You missed it by micro-seconds.</i>

47:17.440 --> 47:19.400
<i>Look, she's -- she's cold</i> <i>
and she's tired.</i>

47:19.400 --> 47:21.400
<i>Let me just sort her out</i> <i>
and I'll call you back.</i>

47:21.400 --> 47:23.400
It's okay, I'll --
I'll just see her later.

47:23.400 --> 47:24.920
I'd better go. Bye.

47:24.920 --> 47:26.200
<i>Bye.</i>

47:34.280 --> 47:36.200
The spy-cam
from the Knightley residence

47:36.200 --> 47:39.760
was purchased on the Internet
from a firm in Hong Kong.

47:39.760 --> 47:43.160
Posted to a PO Box in the name
of "Snap Dragon 2,000."

47:43.160 --> 47:45.160
No listings for it
on Companies House.

47:45.160 --> 47:46.240
But the camera was networked.

47:46.240 --> 47:47.960
Do we know which way
it was pointing?

47:47.960 --> 47:49.520
Untraceable.

47:49.520 --> 47:53.040
The IP address is used by
Surfshark, a VPN service.

47:56.680 --> 47:58.240
Okay.

48:02.040 --> 48:04.240
What are you doing?

48:04.240 --> 48:05.640
What you're not.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.040
Paperwork.

48:26.880 --> 48:30.000
Is everything okay?

48:30.000 --> 48:32.280
With Lupin?

48:32.280 --> 48:33.680
Poppy.

48:33.680 --> 48:35.680
I know.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.040
She's fine.

48:52.200 --> 48:54.880
I used to sit
in my dad's bookshop

48:54.880 --> 48:56.640
and listen to him
chatting to customers

48:56.640 --> 49:00.960
about "getting lost in a book."

49:00.960 --> 49:03.480
And for years,

49:03.480 --> 49:07.400
I thought everyone had
the same problem as me.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.040
Permanently lost.

49:11.480 --> 49:14.200
It's frustrating not
to understand

49:14.200 --> 49:17.000
something so fundamental.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.760
And I found ways
that work for me.

49:19.760 --> 49:21.240
Visual clues.

49:21.240 --> 49:25.360
Pictures make more sense
than words.

49:25.360 --> 49:26.920
Are you okay?

49:28.960 --> 49:31.480
Sorry, go on.

49:34.440 --> 49:41.360
Well, my dad realized
there was another reason

49:41.360 --> 49:44.920
why I was struggling
with schoolwork.

49:44.920 --> 49:49.840
I mean, it was hardly ever
talked about then, dyslexia,

49:49.840 --> 49:53.920
so his solution was to do
all my reading for me,

49:53.920 --> 49:56.920
which was really annoying.

49:56.920 --> 49:59.200
Textbooks, homework,

49:59.200 --> 50:02.680
a chapter of a book every night.

50:02.680 --> 50:05.440
And half the time,
when he was reading,

50:05.440 --> 50:09.640
I'd get impatient,
struggling to follow the story,

50:09.640 --> 50:13.840
the words whizzing by
too fast to picture it right.

50:16.840 --> 50:20.240
But my old man, he persevered.

50:25.200 --> 50:30.200
The thing is,

50:30.200 --> 50:33.040
the words didn't matter.

50:36.400 --> 50:39.000
What mattered was his voice
in my ear.

50:42.400 --> 50:44.880
Knowing that he hadn't
given up on me.

50:56.520 --> 50:59.320
Anyway...

51:03.640 --> 51:05.040
Max, don't ever change.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.600
Never been any good at that.

51:35.400 --> 51:37.800
Bloody hell. Priya!

51:40.920 --> 51:43.000
Keep your eye
on our busker friend.

52:00.400 --> 52:02.800
What was his e-mail address?

52:02.800 --> 52:07.400
Super NH, H, NH, NH...

52:07.400 --> 52:08.800
- Nicholas...
- Hewitt.

52:08.800 --> 52:10.200
Nicholas Hewitt.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.800
TFL issue licenses for buskers.

52:12.800 --> 52:14.480
They'll have an address.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.960
When Andrew Knightley
bumped into you

52:19.960 --> 52:23.240
at South Ken Tube, you
helped yourself to his phone.

52:23.240 --> 52:25.040
Picked his pocket.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.360
No, I didn't!

52:26.360 --> 52:28.360
Station CCTV caught you.

52:28.360 --> 52:30.160
And half an hour ago,

52:30.160 --> 52:34.240
our officers found that phone
at your girlfriend's flat.

52:34.240 --> 52:36.000
No comment.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.960
How much did Darren Goldfinch
pay you for the photos?

52:37.960 --> 52:39.440
No comment.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.200
Did you push Andrew Knightley
onto the tracks?

52:41.200 --> 52:42.880
After all, you were
angry with him.

52:42.880 --> 52:45.480
What, for spilling my coffee?
Come on!

52:45.480 --> 52:47.720
You took his phone,
but that wasn't enough.

52:47.720 --> 52:49.000
And when the red mist
came down,

52:49.000 --> 52:50.600
you decided
to really punish him.

52:50.600 --> 52:52.160
I didn't. I swear.

52:52.160 --> 52:54.080
I went to get a refill.
I was only gone a minute.

52:54.080 --> 52:57.200
And anyway, why would I
stick around to talk to you lot?

52:57.200 --> 52:58.840
This is nuts.

52:58.840 --> 53:02.640
Look, that reporter bloke
Goldfinch, you talk to him?

53:02.640 --> 53:03.720
Of course.

53:03.720 --> 53:05.560
He gave me his card.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.480
So when I found the photos
on the phone, I contacted him.

53:07.480 --> 53:09.680
He offered me 100 quid,
but he hasn't paid.

53:11.880 --> 53:15.160
Process him.
Theft and obstruction.

53:15.160 --> 53:17.400
There's more -- a video too.
I was --

53:17.400 --> 53:19.200
I was gonna charge Goldfinch
extra for it.

53:25.400 --> 53:27.480
When we caught you filming
on the platform,

53:27.480 --> 53:29.200
our officers insist
there was no way

53:29.200 --> 53:30.280
you could have got past them.

53:30.280 --> 53:31.720
So how did you do it?

53:31.720 --> 53:34.240
And don't say
invisibility cloak.

53:37.880 --> 53:40.840
Fire door at the rear
of the station has a dodgy lock.

53:40.840 --> 53:42.920
Can jiggle it open,
let yourself in.

53:42.920 --> 53:45.400
When I was sleeping rough,

53:45.400 --> 53:47.240
I'd use it to get into
the tunnels at night.

53:53.400 --> 53:55.200
The video was recorded
by Andrew Knightley

53:55.200 --> 53:57.400
in his flat
the night before he died.

54:07.200 --> 54:10.040
<i>I need to know...</i>

54:10.040 --> 54:11.040
<i>Is it you?</i>

54:14.800 --> 54:16.240
<i>I need to know...</i>

54:16.240 --> 54:18.640
<i>Is it you?</i>

54:18.640 --> 54:20.440
He's really struggling.

54:20.440 --> 54:22.640
<i>Or am I going mad?</i>

54:22.640 --> 54:24.960
<i>Is it you?</i>

54:24.960 --> 54:26.520
What are you thinking?

54:33.400 --> 54:35.840
We need to find out who
that girl in the photo is.

55:18.240 --> 55:20.120
I've left you some dinner
in the fridge.

55:24.680 --> 55:26.240
You alright?

55:29.200 --> 55:32.520
You know at work,

55:32.520 --> 55:35.200
I know what I'm doing.

55:35.200 --> 55:37.680
I'm good at it.

55:37.680 --> 55:39.400
But with her --
I can't shake this feeling

55:39.400 --> 55:41.320
that I'm just gonna screw it up.

55:44.200 --> 55:45.760
Well, if you want to blame
your mum,

55:45.760 --> 55:47.480
I'm 100% behind that.

55:51.200 --> 55:52.600
Maybe some of it's her fault.

55:52.600 --> 55:55.040
But not all of it.

56:11.080 --> 56:16.520
If I do start to mess this up,

56:16.520 --> 56:17.760
if I am just...

56:23.200 --> 56:29.920
If I am just crap
at being a mum...

56:29.920 --> 56:31.280
you'll tell me, right?

56:33.600 --> 56:35.040
God, no. You're kidding?

56:38.240 --> 56:39.760
Good.

57:14.760 --> 57:17.720
- Morning.
- Morning. Not so fast.

57:17.720 --> 57:19.760
Andrew Knightley's daughter
just touched down at Heathrow.

57:19.760 --> 57:21.440
We're gonna meet her
at his flat.

57:21.440 --> 57:23.920
Finally. Someone who can
shed some light on Andrew.

57:23.920 --> 57:25.720
- Yeah.
- No one seems to know him.

57:25.720 --> 57:27.440
Apart from Hayley.

57:27.440 --> 57:30.040
I got Jess
looking into her movements.

57:32.880 --> 57:35.000
When the hotel said
police from London had called,

57:35.000 --> 57:36.880
I thought I'd been burgled.

57:36.880 --> 57:38.200
I never expected this.

57:38.200 --> 57:39.920
Was your dad in any trouble?

57:39.920 --> 57:42.120
We hardly spoke.

57:42.120 --> 57:45.480
Unless hastily-written birthday
and Christmas cards count.

57:45.480 --> 57:48.360
So he didn't buy you jewelry
for your birthday

57:48.360 --> 57:50.160
No.

57:50.160 --> 57:51.880
Last time we talked
was six months ago,

57:51.880 --> 57:55.400
at Mum's funeral, but even then
only about practicalities --

57:55.400 --> 57:57.240
sorting out Mum's will.

57:57.240 --> 57:59.360
Dad had no interest
in mending bridges.

57:59.360 --> 58:01.600
Me neither after he told me
my mother's death

58:01.600 --> 58:05.880
was God's punishment
for his sins.

58:05.880 --> 58:08.240
Was he due a pay-out?

58:08.240 --> 58:09.640
Mum's life insurance.

58:09.640 --> 58:11.040
It's due any day now.

58:14.600 --> 58:18.960
We found this photograph
on the mantelpiece.

58:18.960 --> 58:21.400
Who is it?

58:21.400 --> 58:23.240
I don't know,
but I've seen her before.

58:26.880 --> 58:28.200
Dad used to do anything for you,

58:28.200 --> 58:31.760
and then one day,
he couldn't care less.

58:31.760 --> 58:34.880
Mum blamed it
on his accident.

58:34.880 --> 58:36.240
What accident?

58:36.240 --> 58:38.800
He wrote off Mum's car.

58:38.800 --> 58:40.480
Broke his arm?

58:40.480 --> 58:41.800
Yeah.

58:41.800 --> 58:43.840
When was this?

58:43.840 --> 58:45.400
End of my second year at uni,

58:45.400 --> 58:49.400
so June, July 2012.

58:49.400 --> 58:50.720
Did he go to the hospital?

58:50.720 --> 58:52.480
Yeah, of course.

58:52.480 --> 58:54.200
Only there's no mention
in his medical records

58:54.200 --> 58:56.680
about a broken arm.

58:56.680 --> 58:58.760
There must be.

58:58.760 --> 59:00.800
What was your mother's
occupation?

59:00.800 --> 59:01.880
Well, she was a nurse.

59:01.880 --> 59:04.200
So then it's possible...

59:04.200 --> 59:05.640
No. That's absurd.

59:05.640 --> 59:07.400
Why -- Why wouldn't he
go to the hospital?

59:07.400 --> 59:10.840
Can you tell us anything else
about the accident?

59:10.840 --> 59:13.400
I was away when it happened.

59:13.400 --> 59:16.880
Next time I came home --
Christmas --

59:16.880 --> 59:19.000
Dad's arm had healed,
but he wasn't himself.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.760
He just wanted to be left
on his own.

59:22.760 --> 59:24.520
And then one day,
I found him in his workshop,

59:24.520 --> 59:27.600
staring at this picture.

59:27.600 --> 59:29.400
I asked him if he was okay

59:29.400 --> 59:32.160
and he shouted
and pushed me out.

59:32.160 --> 59:34.880
As soon as I graduated,
I moved out.

59:34.880 --> 59:37.480
Couldn't wait to get away.

59:37.480 --> 59:39.040
But you don't know who she is?

59:41.880 --> 59:44.680
Or what your father's sin was?

59:44.680 --> 59:46.400
No.

59:46.400 --> 59:49.000
There's so much I wish I knew.

1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:10.880
According to Andrew Knightley's
financial records,

1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:14.400
he purchased
a silver chain necklace

1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:16.480
and a pair of diamond earrings
on the 18th

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:19.400
and 25th of this month.

1:00:19.400 --> 1:00:21.800
You told us he bought those
for his daughter.

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:23.360
That's what he told me.

1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:28.080
The mast data for your mobile

1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:29.680
shows you at Andrew Knightley's
address

1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:34.000
on two occasions -- the 5th
and the 12th of this month.

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:35.960
Andrew sometimes asked me to
drop things off on my way home.

1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:39.160
He had a habit of
leaving his keys behind.

1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:42.880
When we asked before if you'd
been to his flat, you said no.

1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:45.400
I've never been inside.

1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:49.400
The morning before he died,
he withdrew £500.

1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:51.200
Do you know anything about that?

1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:52.920
No.

1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:56.000
Were you romantically involved
with Andrew Knightley?

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.280
What?

1:00:57.280 --> 1:00:59.320
That's absurd. Of course not.

1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:04.720
Can you identify this girl?

1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:06.680
It's just someone
off the Internet.

1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:10.720
It's Andrew's reference photo
for the carving of the angel.

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:12.480
Some food items we found
in his kitchen

1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:14.640
had been laced with opioids.

1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:16.000
Do you know anything about that?

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:17.840
- No.
- If we searched your flat,

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:19.520
would we find
similar substances?

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:21.440
No.

1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:23.240
We believe someone was trying
to gaslight Andrew,

1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:25.720
con him out of money
and expensive gifts.

1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:31.520
Was that the plan --
to exploit him?

1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:33.200
- No.
- Did he tell you about

1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:34.680
the pay-out
he was due to receive

1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:36.640
- from his wife's life insurance?
- No.

1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:38.680
Where were you the morning
Andrew Knightley died?

1:01:38.680 --> 1:01:40.440
I was at home.

1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:42.720
If you have my GPS data,
you should know that.

1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:44.400
Unless you left your
phone there?

1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:46.200
Did you speak to my flatmate?

1:01:46.200 --> 1:01:47.760
She'll confirm I was at home.

1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:42.240
Max.

1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:46.040
You don't want it?

1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:47.640
Thanks, but no.

1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:49.920
I felt guilty for breaking
your old one,

1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:52.720
so I -- I replaced it.

1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:54.800
Am I missing something?

1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:56.200
Do you want to come in?

1:02:56.200 --> 1:02:57.480
No, I don't want to come in.

1:02:57.480 --> 1:02:59.000
Fine.

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:03.360
Okay. I'll come in.

1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:14.200
I'm jealous.

1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:15.960
There.

1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:17.880
Is that what you want to hear?

1:03:17.880 --> 1:03:21.640
I'm jealous because you seem to
be doing alright without me.

1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:23.040
On a houseboat.

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:24.240
You're not jealous.

1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:25.720
And angry.

1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:28.360
You want me to think
you're jealous and angry.

1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:30.120
You're infuriating.

1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:31.760
It eats you up, you can't
control what I do any more.

1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:33.320
Nonsense!

1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:38.200
Take the bloody machine.

1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:40.440
I want you to have it.

1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:42.120
Take it.

1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:44.200
It's the top model, much better
than your old one.

1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:46.680
There it is.

1:03:46.680 --> 1:03:48.240
What?

1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:51.440
I'm going to repair
my coffee machine.

1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:53.480
That's what you do
when something's broken, Asti,

1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:57.120
you fix it.

1:03:57.120 --> 1:03:58.640
I'm gonna give it
to someone else then.

1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:01.200
Oh, you have to make everything
so complicated.

1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:02.640
I loathe complications.

1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:04.240
You thrive on them.

1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:05.680
I bet you broke my machine
on purpose.

1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:07.440
Please!

1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:09.200
You create these dramas
so you can take control.

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:12.400
That is not fair!

1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:14.040
- Drink your wine.
- I'm driving.

1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:15.440
You're bicycling!

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.280
We outgrew each other.

1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:28.760
Well, I outgrew you.

1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:37.600
Do you miss me?

1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:38.840
I most definitely do not.

1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:41.800
Good.

1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:43.520
Good.

1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:55.200
I don't want it.

1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:57.120
Will you please take
the bloody thing?

1:04:57.120 --> 1:04:59.560
- Keep it for your guests.
- I don't have any guests.

1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:02.600
Asti, you asked me to leave
and now you're upset?

1:05:02.600 --> 1:05:06.400
Or are you scared
I might have outgrown you?

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:08.040
And I like my houseboat.

1:05:08.040 --> 1:05:09.600
Whoop-dee-bloody-do!

1:05:41.600 --> 1:05:42.960
Simon?

1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:44.880
I'm doing some washing.

1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:46.080
Do you want me to --

1:05:58.640 --> 1:06:00.160
Livvy?

1:06:04.280 --> 1:06:05.840
Well, what do you think?

1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:11.200
Livvy, have you forgotten?

1:06:11.200 --> 1:06:13.360
Forgotten what?

1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:15.080
You asked me to sell those.

1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:20.280
You don't remember?

1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:23.200
It was a couple of nights back,

1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:24.960
you asked me to get
the ball rolling.

1:06:29.240 --> 1:06:31.400
God, you know what,
this is my fault.

1:06:31.400 --> 1:06:34.720
It was after we had two spliffs
and a bottle of red.

1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:37.600
I'm sorry, I should've
checked with you first.

1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:39.160
Are you alright?

1:06:39.160 --> 1:06:42.400
I mean, going through my things
like this,

1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:44.360
that is not the Livvy I know.

1:06:48.200 --> 1:06:49.680
What's wrong?

1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:54.720
I'd like it if you packed
your things and left.

1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:01.480
And it's Olivia.

1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:03.040
Not Livvy.

1:07:15.920 --> 1:07:19.480
Is everything alright?

1:07:19.480 --> 1:07:23.520
Oh, £350's not a bad price,
considering.

1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:24.880
What's the problem?

1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:26.880
Your police antenna
was right, Max.

1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:27.960
I didn't sell this.

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:29.520
I found it in Simon's room.

1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:32.240
He's been helping himself
to your Dad's books.

1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:36.360
Little bastard,
conning old people.

1:07:36.360 --> 1:07:40.080
People. Conning people.

1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:41.360
I looked at his eBay account.

1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:43.040
This is the sixth one he sold.

1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:47.280
"Snapdragon."

1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:57.600
He's not bloody dyslexic either.

1:07:57.600 --> 1:07:59.000
Is he still at yours?

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.520
Yes, but I told him
to pack his things.

1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:04.080
Leave it with me.

1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:19.680
Can I have a word?

1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:20.720
What about?

1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:22.280
About a video.

1:08:50.760 --> 1:08:52.200
Are these from
Mr Clarke's pockets?

1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:53.680
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:00.800
You've knocked him out cold.

1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:04.560
Paramedics have taken him
to hospital for a scan.

1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:07.640
Five days ago, Simon Turnbull
saw you receiving money

1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:09.880
from Andrew Knightley.

1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:14.040
The day before, Knightley
withdrew £500 from his account.

1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:18.440
Is this what's left of it?

1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:20.200
You'll have to ask Knightley.

1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:23.000
- Well, we can't, can we?
- Why not?

1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.240
He was murdered four days ago.

1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:27.680
Pushed onto the tracks
at South Ken tube.

1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:29.040
You didn't know?

1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:39.600
Did Andrew ask you
to pay Simon a visit?

1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:41.920
Start of the week, I saw Simon
arguing with Knightley

1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:43.840
about a video.

1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:45.240
Simon wanted him
to pay five grand

1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:46.800
or he'd put it up on YouTube.

1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:48.960
So you offered to help?

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:51.920
£500's cheaper than five grand.

1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:53.640
You're all heart.

1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:08.040
Simon Turnbull takes
a lot of selfies.

1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:15.080
I found this bible
in Simon's room.

1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:16.960
The passages marked are the same
as the ones

1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:18.440
on Andrew Knightley's mirror.

1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:31.440
Is that Hayley
from the Stonemasons?

1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:39.360
Do you think they're more
than just friends?

1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:40.920
Maybe.

1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:46.120
Hello.

1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:50.680
Looks like it was Simon
gaslighting Knightley.

1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:52.240
I bet he was drugging him too.

1:11:03.640 --> 1:11:06.400
There's an unmarked folder here.

1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:07.960
It's video files.

1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:18.440
- That's the spy camera footage.
- Yeah.

1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:23.040
Andrew waking up,

1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:25.040
opening the curtains.

1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:28.880
Andrew laying out clothes,

1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:31.840
Andrew leaving,
coming back with a mug of tea.

1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:37.360
Andrew...

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:40.600
Oh.

1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:42.720
Oh, dear.

1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:46.240
And there's Hayley again.

1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:49.480
<i>Please God, forgive me.</i>

1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:51.880
Candle wax.

1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:55.360
<i>Forgive me for my sins.</i>

1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:03.400
Whose idea was it
to target Andrew?

1:12:03.400 --> 1:12:05.720
Yours or Simon's?

1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:07.480
Did you know he was drugging
Andrew Knightley?

1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:09.200
No.

1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:11.680
Did you give Simon
Andrew's keys?

1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:18.040
This is Simon's laptop.

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.920
<i>Oh, please, God, forgive me.</i>

1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:31.600
<i>Forgive me for my sins.</i>

1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:34.520
<i>Forgive me for my --</i>

1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:47.560
Last month, Andrew and I
were working late.

1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:51.720
He was acting strangely,
like he was scared to go home,

1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:54.440
so I asked him what was wrong.

1:12:54.440 --> 1:13:00.320
He said a ghost was leaving him
these messages to punish him.

1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:02.200
For what?

1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:05.400
For his sins.

1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:08.040
But you knew it was Simon
leaving them?

1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:10.440
Not until much later.

1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:12.520
At first, I thought Andrew was
writing them to himself.

1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:16.600
Then, Simon told me it was him.

1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:18.640
He said it was a prank.

1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:20.680
But Andrew was convinced

1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:23.040
the only way to stop
the messages was for him...

1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:26.840
For him to punish himself.

1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:30.720
I tried to talk him out of it.

1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:37.520
Then he asked if I would help.

1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:40.120
I didn't know what to say.

1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:44.480
I felt sorry for him,
so I said sure, I'd help.

1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:48.800
I didn't know what he had
in mind till I turned up.

1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:55.600
The jewelry was
a thank you gift.

1:13:55.600 --> 1:13:58.880
Or payment, I suppose.

1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:01.440
Only happened a couple of times.

1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:05.720
Did you confide in Simon
that this was going on?

1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:09.720
That's when he told me
it was him writing the messages.

1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:12.160
I told him to stop.
It wasn't funny.

1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:16.680
I had no idea he planned
on filming it.

1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:19.400
Assured me I was doing the
right thing by helping Andrew.

1:14:39.920 --> 1:14:44.000
You still haven't unpacked, Max.

1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:45.200
I've been a bit busy!

1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:57.640
This actually makes sense
to you?

1:14:57.640 --> 1:14:58.880
Yeah.

1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:01.360
It's how I see things.

1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:06.640
Right, let's separate the murder
from the mirror-writing.

1:15:06.640 --> 1:15:08.600
We can't place Simon,

1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:12.800
Hayley, or Davinson Clarke
at South Ken tube.

1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:20.240
What if Andrew Knightley
genuinely thought a ghost

1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:22.760
was writing to him?

1:15:22.760 --> 1:15:27.800
If so...

1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:29.800
was that his ghost?

1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:32.280
Who is she?

1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:39.200
Hayley said he hated
working on that.

1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:40.680
The Angel Gabriel.

1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:46.200
Gabriel. Gabriel...

1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:47.600
Gabrielle.

1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:50.200
Gabriella.

1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:52.240
Andrew's search history.

1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:54.360
Two weeks before he died,
he searched for

1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:56.120
"Gabriella, Tottenham."

1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:57.720
"Gabriella, Tottenham."

1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:08.280
When did his daughter
say his accident was?

1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:12.040
Um, uh, June, July 2012.

1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:17.640
Here it is.

1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:20.960
<i>Tottenham Record,</i>
20th of June, 2012.

1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:24.920
Gabriella Hadlow, 19 years old,
charity worker.

1:16:24.920 --> 1:16:27.400
Died following a hit-and-run.

1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:30.200
There's a photo.

1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:31.760
Yeah, it's her.

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:37.280
She worked for Crisis.

1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:39.080
Gabriella Hadlow?

1:16:42.400 --> 1:16:46.440
That barbecue that Andrew
dragged Hayley to.

1:16:46.440 --> 1:16:47.680
It was for a charity.

1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:51.040
Hadlow. Hadlow.

1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:52.600
Hadlow...

1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:54.720
Hadlow House?

1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:57.720
Was it Hadlow House?

1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:03.880
Yeah, here it is, Hadlow House.

1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:05.880
"Taking action
to end homelessness."

1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:07.600
Founded in May 2013 by family

1:17:07.600 --> 1:17:10.040
and friends of Gabriella Hadlow,
in her memory.

1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:16.120
Where have I seen
that logo before?

1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:22.640
An eyewitness, Toby Spencer,

1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:24.640
supplied Haringey with
a description of the driver.

1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:28.440
White male, 50s, red saloon,
but they never found him.

1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:31.200
- Did you?
- Oh, yes.

1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:33.680
According to the DVLA,

1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:36.200
a 2008 red Mondeo

1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:38.120
registered to
Katherine Knightley,

1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:40.880
Andrew's wife, was updated SORN

1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:43.200
on the 2nd of August, 2012.

1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:44.720
He took it off the road.

1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:46.000
I've checked his
insurance records,

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:47.280
and there's no sign of a claim.

1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:50.640
He scrapped it,
destroyed the evidence.

1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:52.480
There was a survivor,

1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:54.720
suffered minor injuries.

1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:55.880
In the vehicle?

1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:58.840
No, friend of the deceased.

1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:01.480
With her when
the collision occurred.

1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:04.360
Listed in the report
as Jane Reece.

1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:06.280
Wait.

1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:09.200
Middle name, Erin.

1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:10.720
Thanks, Jess.

1:18:15.720 --> 1:18:19.320
Erin told us that
she volunteered for a charity.

1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:23.880
That's where I've seen
that logo before.

1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:26.080
The busker's coffee cup.

1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:28.600
But on CCTV,
there was no sign of her.

1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:39.360
White with a blue ripple.

1:19:04.200 --> 1:19:06.480
Afternoon, Mrs. Murphy.

1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:08.920
- May we have a word?
- Please.

1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:11.120
How can I help?

1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:14.880
We wanted to ask you about
an accident in 2012.

1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:18.760
A hit-and-run which resulted
in the death of a young lady

1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:20.520
called Gabriella Hadlow.

1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:28.360
We believe Andrew Knightley
was the driver

1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:29.920
of the vehicle responsible.

1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:31.680
What can you tell us about that?

1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:43.040
Gabriella's family speak
very fondly of you.

1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:50.200
We know you volunteer for
a charity called Hadlow House.

1:19:50.200 --> 1:19:51.920
And according to their schedule,

1:19:51.920 --> 1:19:54.240
the morning
Andrew Knightley died,

1:19:54.240 --> 1:19:55.840
you were doing
the breakfast run,

1:19:55.840 --> 1:19:58.000
serving food and hot drinks
from the back of their van

1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:00.360
a short distance
from South Kensington station.

1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:02.240
That schedule's wrong.
I was --

1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:04.280
You knew Andrew Knightley
would be at the station

1:20:04.280 --> 1:20:06.080
at that time of the day.

1:20:06.080 --> 1:20:08.360
No.
Working for the homeless,

1:20:08.360 --> 1:20:10.000
you know about
the broken fire door

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:12.160
at the back of the station.

1:20:12.160 --> 1:20:14.760
That's how you gained access,
isn't it,

1:20:14.760 --> 1:20:16.320
Erin?

1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:22.480
Mrs. Murphy, is this your coat?

1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:24.040
Yes.

1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:29.200
White with a blue ripple.

1:20:32.400 --> 1:20:35.320
We found this on the tracks
near Andrew Knightley's body.

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:40.040
You must have lost it
when you pushed him.

1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:45.040
June 2012.

1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:50.480
What happened that night?

1:20:54.840 --> 1:20:56.680
We were walking back
from the college bar,

1:20:56.680 --> 1:20:58.600
like we did
a few times each week.

1:20:58.600 --> 1:21:02.280
Then this car...

1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:04.480
It was like it appeared
from nowhere.

1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:06.080
Andrew Knightley was driving?

1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:11.600
I wasn't sure
till I saw him again.

1:21:12.760 --> 1:21:14.440
When was that?

1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:18.200
When I started working here
about three years ago.

1:21:18.200 --> 1:21:21.880
I recognized him,
but he didn't know me from Eve.

1:21:21.880 --> 1:21:23.480
Did you confront him?

1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:26.200
What would he have said?
That he was sorry?

1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:27.600
I know why
he didn't wait around,

1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:30.400
why he didn't go to the police.

1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:32.360
Way he was driving,
he was clearly drunk.

1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:38.200
I did what Gabby would've done.
I decided to...

1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:41.680
understand him,

1:21:41.680 --> 1:21:43.440
to forgive him.

1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:46.960
So what changed?

1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:49.400
When we organized the barbecue
and Andrew offered

1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:51.640
to pay for it all,
I thought it was a kind gesture.

1:21:51.640 --> 1:21:54.120
I thought he was
a good man after all,

1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:59.440
that he had remorse
for what he'd done.

1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:01.080
I could've lived with that.

1:22:03.480 --> 1:22:07.440
But then he told me
about his ghost,

1:22:07.440 --> 1:22:09.280
sent me that text.

1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:11.720
"An evil in my home."

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.880
How dare he.

1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:19.040
"An evil in my home."

1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:20.480
That's how he described her.

1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:22.880
"An evil in my home."

1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:24.840
How dare he.

1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:26.360
So you decided to punish him?

1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:27.920
Yes.

1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:33.600
You went on to the platform
to wait for him?

1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:41.400
He should've stopped.

1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:43.040
He shouldn't have driven off.

1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:50.040
A good man would've taken
Gabriella to hospital.

1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:53.360
A good man would've saved her.

1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:56.960
Andrew Knightley was not
a good man.

1:23:01.200 --> 1:23:05.680
Yes, I pushed him.

1:23:09.200 --> 1:23:11.040
I'm so, so sorry.

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:54.200
Paperwork then.

1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:56.840
Can it wait until tomorrow?

1:23:56.840 --> 1:23:59.760
Only I'd like to go home,
if that's okay?

1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:02.280
Is everything alright?

1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:04.960
Yeah. Yeah.

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:07.400
At least I'm getting there.

1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:09.360
I'll see you tomorrow, Max.

1:24:09.360 --> 1:24:11.000
Enjoy your smelly boat.

1:24:35.640 --> 1:24:38.840
I've been avoiding it.

1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:41.760
Oh, I realize that.

1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:44.800
I've been tending it
until you were ready.

1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:49.840
Fighting a losing battle, mind.

1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:21.760
Your dad would have loved that.

1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:29.760
Ready?

1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:37.200
Bye, Dad.
