01:10.005 --> 01:12.925
Before I dismiss you for the weekend,
a few announcements.

01:13.085 --> 01:16.245
On Monday morning,
several of our year thirteens

01:16.325 --> 01:19.645
will face their GCSE maths resit.

01:19.725 --> 01:23.365
Now, I know how daunting
resit examinations can be,

01:23.445 --> 01:26.245
so if anyone is feeling anxious
or worried,

01:26.325 --> 01:27.725
or even if you just want to chat,

01:27.805 --> 01:30.925
please, please, do not come crying to me.

01:31.005 --> 01:32.405
Let me see. What else?

01:32.485 --> 01:34.365
Come on, come on, come on to fuck!

01:34.445 --> 01:36.765
"Notice from Mr. Macaulay.

01:36.845 --> 01:39.845
This year's destination
for the Euro Trotters trip

01:39.925 --> 01:41.845
will be, dramatic pause..."

01:45.245 --> 01:47.765
Did you actually want me
to do the dramatic pause?

01:49.045 --> 01:50.365
Interesting.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.005
Paris. It's going to be Paris.

01:54.085 --> 01:57.765
If you need any further information,
there is a stall in the foyer.

01:58.205 --> 02:03.085
Sadly, I am unable to come on this one,
as I despise the French.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.485
Name of the Father, the Son,
the Holy Spirit.

02:12.485 --> 02:14.805
There's so much I want to do.
The Champs-Élysées,

02:14.885 --> 02:16.765
the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.925
A French fella.
That's what I want to do.

02:19.005 --> 02:22.205
Nation of rides. My fanny's going funny
just thinking about it.

02:22.285 --> 02:25.005
- Could you not use that word, Michelle?
- What, "fanny"?

02:25.085 --> 02:27.541
- Why do you always have to be coarse?
- Ach, what's the big deal?

02:27.565 --> 02:29.285
- We all have one.
- I don't.

02:29.365 --> 02:32.445
- You are one.
- Of course, Beckett lived in Paris,

02:32.525 --> 02:35.325
and if anybody's influenced my writing,
it is...

02:35.405 --> 02:37.525
- What, Brenda Beckett from 12A?
- No!

02:37.605 --> 02:39.965
Not Brenda Beckett. "Beckett" Beckett.

02:40.045 --> 02:42.805
If we go to Paris,
I'd like to meet Nicole.

02:42.885 --> 02:44.525
- Who's Nicole?
- For God's sake.

02:44.605 --> 02:47.845
How many times?
It's just an ad. She's not a real person.

02:47.925 --> 02:49.245
Neither is Papa.

02:49.325 --> 02:52.765
Be good conversation practice as well,
you know, for the orals.

02:52.845 --> 02:55.645
- Which will be the only oral that you...
- Yeah, okay, Michelle.

02:55.725 --> 02:59.005
- You didn't let me finish.
- Well, I sensed where you were going.

02:59.685 --> 03:01.685
- Blowjobs.
- Oh, God.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.045
Don't tell me Charlene Kavanagh is going.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.365
She is dying about herself.

03:06.445 --> 03:08.885
"Oh, I'm so good-looking.
Oh, I'm so popular."

03:08.965 --> 03:11.285
If there ever was a more shallow,

03:11.365 --> 03:14.085
self-absorbed,
generally unpleasant human being...

03:14.165 --> 03:15.165
Hi, Erin.

03:15.645 --> 03:16.645
Hi.

03:17.205 --> 03:19.165
Good. Grand. Not too bad.

03:19.245 --> 03:20.805
Can't complain.

03:20.885 --> 03:23.925
Is the answer I'd have given
if you'd asked how I was.

03:24.005 --> 03:26.365
Right. Are you signing up for Paris?

03:26.965 --> 03:29.325
I can't convince that lot to come.

03:29.405 --> 03:31.805
Looks like I'm going to need someone to
hang out with.

03:32.845 --> 03:34.205
It would be an honor.

03:35.165 --> 03:37.805
Okay, well, I'll see you later, then.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.725
You will, Charlene. Indeed you will.

03:40.805 --> 03:42.205
Did you hear that?

03:42.285 --> 03:46.285
The Charlene Kavanagh wants to hang
around with little old me!

03:46.365 --> 03:49.805
You know what I admire most about you,
Erin? Your unshakeable principles.

03:52.245 --> 03:55.485
<i>Bonjour. Tout le monde.
Comment allez-vous?</i>

03:55.565 --> 03:57.805
- Wise up, Jenny.
- Where do we sign?

03:57.885 --> 04:00.005
Hold on. Stall the fucking ball.

04:00.085 --> 04:02.765
375 quid? Are you for real?

04:02.845 --> 04:05.645
What? £375 each?

04:06.525 --> 04:09.845
- Isn't there some sort of group discount?
- It's not Club 18 to 30.

04:09.925 --> 04:11.845
- More's the pity.
- It is a bit steep, Jenny.

04:11.925 --> 04:15.285
Just dip into your trust fund.
I do it all the time.

04:15.365 --> 04:16.524
Our what?

04:16.605 --> 04:19.421
It's like an account your parents
set up for you to help pay for things,

04:19.445 --> 04:23.685
like university, your first car,
educational trips.

04:23.765 --> 04:25.925
I did not know about this.

04:26.005 --> 04:28.365
- Did you know about this?
- No, did I fuck.

04:29.005 --> 04:30.045
Trust fund, you say?

04:31.205 --> 04:32.325
Interesting.

04:33.285 --> 04:36.965
Dip into your trust fund?
Of course, no bother at all.

04:37.045 --> 04:39.285
Pass us then the phone.
I just need to ring the bank.

04:39.885 --> 04:43.445
7-6-5-4-3-2-1. That's the account number
and the password.

04:43.525 --> 04:45.485
What is it again?
What was it now?

04:45.565 --> 04:47.525
Oh, aye. Catch yourself on!

04:47.605 --> 04:49.925
Da, for God's sake,
will you turn that down?

04:50.005 --> 04:51.685
I have turned it down. It's at zero.

04:51.765 --> 04:53.005
<i>...opportunity there.</i>

04:53.085 --> 04:54.645
I don't know how he does it.

04:54.725 --> 04:56.405
You telling me I don't have a trust fund?

04:56.485 --> 04:58.221
There you go.
You're not as slow as you look.

04:58.245 --> 05:00.365
Do I have a trust fund, Mary?

05:00.445 --> 05:03.885
Listen, girls, there are no trust funds.
There are no funds, period.

05:03.965 --> 05:05.645
For God's sake!

05:05.725 --> 05:10.005
Okay. That's one portion of red fish,
one portion of white fish,

05:10.085 --> 05:12.045
- two bags of chips...
- No, no, no.

05:12.125 --> 05:14.485
- Two bags won't be enough.
- Two's plenty, Joe.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.885
- Four. Four should cover it.
- Three, then. We'll compromise.

05:17.965 --> 05:20.605
- I'll compromise you through that window.
- That's enough, Da.

05:20.685 --> 05:23.125
The tight bastard
is trying to starve us all, Mary.

05:23.205 --> 05:25.605
Okay, four bags of chips, then.

05:25.685 --> 05:28.405
And I want 12 chicken nuggets,
a small battered hot dog,

05:28.485 --> 05:30.965
- plenty of onions, plenty of...
- Get a move on, Daddy.

05:31.045 --> 05:33.605
At that chippy, it's every man for himself
on a Friday night.

05:33.685 --> 05:35.485
I am trying to concentrate here, Erin.

05:35.565 --> 05:37.885
- All right, Mammy?
- All right, love.

05:37.965 --> 05:39.925
Did you ask about the trust fund?

05:40.005 --> 05:41.405
Uh, I don't have one.

05:42.085 --> 05:43.605
I take it that means I don't have one.

05:43.685 --> 05:45.285
For the love of God.

05:45.365 --> 05:48.285
- Will four bags be enough?
- More than enough.

05:48.365 --> 05:51.005
I say we need five, to be safe.
Do you not think, Da?

05:51.085 --> 05:52.645
Stick down five.

05:52.725 --> 05:55.885
- Five bags of chips, then!
- I'll have a chicken fillet burger.

05:55.965 --> 05:57.645
No lettuce, no tomato, no cheese.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.365
- I'll just write "plain," will I?
- No onions, no cucumber.

06:00.445 --> 06:02.605
- One plain...
- No relish, no pickles, no mayonnaise.

06:02.685 --> 06:04.965
- No chicken.
- What do you mean, no chicken?

06:05.045 --> 06:06.525
Get that.

06:08.845 --> 06:11.405
It's a chicken burger,
of course I want chicken!

06:12.045 --> 06:14.605
- What are you, a simpleton?
- Hello?

06:14.685 --> 06:15.925
No chicken.

06:17.045 --> 06:18.365
It's Uncle Colm.

06:18.445 --> 06:21.605
Well, I'm not taking it.
I've been stung once already this week,

06:21.685 --> 06:24.965
and I'm 45 minutes talking
about his new shoelaces.

06:25.045 --> 06:27.965
I've stopped answering my phone altogether
for fear it's him, Mary.

06:28.045 --> 06:29.725
- Will you take it, Da?
- No chance, love.

06:29.805 --> 06:33.565
I mean, I know I shouldn't say this about
my own brother, but by Christ

06:33.645 --> 06:36.845
- he's a boring bastard.
- Is somebody going to take it or not?

06:36.925 --> 06:38.685
- Don't be cheeky.
- Less of the cheek, you.

06:40.165 --> 06:41.325
How's it going, Colm?

06:42.565 --> 06:44.485
Would you ever think of going cordless?

06:44.565 --> 06:47.205
Aye, it was freezing cold earlier,
that's true.

06:47.285 --> 06:50.565
Gemma Sharkey went cordless
and she's like a new woman now, Gerry.

06:50.645 --> 06:54.085
- No, it's not as cold now.
- She can make a call from her living room,

06:54.165 --> 06:56.885
from her kitchen, from her bedroom...

06:56.965 --> 07:00.165
Right, look, Colm, I don't have long.
We're sending to the chippy here.

07:00.245 --> 07:05.005
And the other night, right, and this is no
word of a lie, she rang me from the bath.

07:05.085 --> 07:07.365
These cordless phones are the future.

07:07.445 --> 07:10.325
- What? Oh, my God!
- What's up?

07:10.405 --> 07:12.365
Our Colm's in the police station.

07:12.445 --> 07:14.925
Last night, two gunmen
forced their way into his house,

07:15.005 --> 07:17.405
tied him up, stole his van.

07:17.485 --> 07:18.565
Dirty bastards.

07:18.645 --> 07:20.925
Oh, God, love you, you poor critter.

07:21.565 --> 07:23.285
You're to come straight round here,
hear me?

07:23.365 --> 07:25.645
Oh, of course. Of course.

07:26.645 --> 07:28.125
Is he all right?

07:28.205 --> 07:30.565
He is traumatized, Gerry.

07:31.525 --> 07:33.365
He'll take a steak and kidney pie.

07:34.805 --> 07:36.565
Do you think five bags will be enough?

07:40.605 --> 07:42.765
<i>♪ Ah, push it ♪</i>

07:42.845 --> 07:44.405
Seven bags of chips,

07:44.485 --> 07:49.325
12 chicken nuggets,
one small battered hot dog,

07:49.405 --> 07:52.805
- one plain chicken burger...
- Give me that. Me.

07:52.885 --> 07:54.565
Thank you, Fionnula.

07:54.645 --> 07:57.365
- All right? Any joy with the trust fund?
- Nah.

07:57.445 --> 07:59.325
According to my ma,
we're actually quite poor.

07:59.405 --> 08:01.605
Aye, I think we might be as well.

08:01.685 --> 08:02.821
- What's yours?
- Uh...

08:02.845 --> 08:05.485
Can I p-please get one... one fish supper
and one cowboy special,

08:05.565 --> 08:08.181
- please, Fionnula, thank you, please?
- It'll be ready when it's ready.

08:08.205 --> 08:11.365
Well, Jenny Joyce was talking through
her fat hole about this trust fund thing.

08:11.445 --> 08:13.685
- What's yours?
- Don't rush me, Fionnula.

08:14.805 --> 08:17.285
Where the fuck are we going
to get the money for Paris now?

08:17.365 --> 08:18.845
We could sell our organs.

08:18.925 --> 08:21.605
We could. We could sell our organs.

08:21.685 --> 08:24.165
Or, and forgive me
if this is a bit left field,

08:24.245 --> 08:26.405
but could we not, you know, get jobs?

08:26.485 --> 08:27.565
There are no jobs in Derry.

08:27.605 --> 08:30.525
- That's all you hear anybody say.
- So what are these?

08:31.965 --> 08:35.205
I never really looked at this before.
I assumed they were all dead cat posters.

08:35.284 --> 08:38.085
- Missing cat posters.
- If you're an optimist.

08:38.164 --> 08:41.525
I'm not sure if I'd be suited to any
of these. They're all very practical,

08:41.605 --> 08:43.445
and I'm just more... creative.

08:43.525 --> 08:45.125
You're more of a slabber.

08:50.885 --> 08:52.125
Fuck's sake.

08:52.205 --> 08:54.365
I think other people
are onto this thing, girls.

08:54.445 --> 08:56.925
- Oi! I'll not ask you again.
- A large cowboy, Fionnula.

08:57.005 --> 08:59.421
- And don't be shy with the salt now.
- What about the wee limey?

08:59.445 --> 09:00.485
Well, dicko?

09:01.965 --> 09:03.525
I'm okay, thanks.

09:03.605 --> 09:05.925
- What?
- I don't really want anything.

09:06.005 --> 09:07.005
You don't want anything?

09:07.085 --> 09:08.781
How could you not want anything?
It's lovely.

09:08.805 --> 09:11.685
- I don't really fancy it, that's all.
- I don't understand.

09:11.765 --> 09:15.445
- Are you not feeling well, James?
- I don't like it, okay?

09:15.525 --> 09:18.925
It's too greasy!
It's much, much too greasy!

09:19.005 --> 09:23.005
Even the smell of it
makes me feel physically sick.

09:24.085 --> 09:26.765
I'm sorry that you had to hear that,
Fionnula.

09:27.405 --> 09:29.045
You're a fucking embarrassment.

09:29.125 --> 09:30.885
Get him out of here.

09:30.965 --> 09:32.285
You heard the woman.

09:32.365 --> 09:34.365
<i>♪ Ah, push it ♪</i>

09:34.445 --> 09:36.045
<i>♪ Push it real good ♪</i>

09:36.125 --> 09:37.925
There was a knock at the door.

09:38.005 --> 09:39.045
This must have been...

09:39.125 --> 09:41.525
ah, we're talking eight, half-eight,

09:41.605 --> 09:43.285
for I was halfway through me dinner.

09:43.805 --> 09:45.725
And up I got to open it.

09:46.165 --> 09:49.165
And there they both were, large as life.

09:49.925 --> 09:51.285
And the taller fella...

09:51.565 --> 09:54.445
though, to be fair, there was
no more than an inch in it.

09:54.525 --> 09:55.525
Jesus wept.

09:55.605 --> 09:59.325
The slightly taller fella,
he says to me, says he,

09:59.405 --> 10:02.061
- "Do you know who we are?"
- How's a body supposed to enjoy dinner?

10:02.085 --> 10:05.645
And I says to him, says I,
"Well, I can't be sure now,

10:05.725 --> 10:08.245
but maybe if you took off
the balaclavas."

10:08.805 --> 10:12.125
And then he says to me,
the slightly taller fella does,

10:12.205 --> 10:14.445
he says, "Step aside. We're armed."

10:14.525 --> 10:15.685
Crass.

10:15.765 --> 10:18.205
And that's when the smaller fella,

10:18.285 --> 10:20.005
although, as I say,
we're talking an inch...

10:20.045 --> 10:22.101
- Mammy, make it stop.
- ...inch and a half at most.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.765
- I need a drink.
- He has the bright idea

10:24.845 --> 10:26.605
of tying me to the radiator, you see.

10:27.285 --> 10:29.405
And I remember saying to myself, says I,

10:29.485 --> 10:34.045
"Colm, it's a good job you have
the economy seven on the old timer,

10:34.125 --> 10:35.645
or you'd be roasted here."

10:35.725 --> 10:37.805
Did you go for the economy seven
in the end, Colm?

10:37.885 --> 10:40.205
I thought you says the hot water settings
were a minefield.

10:40.245 --> 10:42.405
For the love of God, Sarah,
no diversions, please.

10:42.485 --> 10:44.661
Aye, come on, let's pack it up.
They tied you to the heater.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.045
They did indeed.

10:46.125 --> 10:49.125
And there I am,
shackled to the thermostatic valve

10:49.205 --> 10:50.325
with me new shoelaces,

10:50.405 --> 10:53.125
when one of them,
the smaller fella...

10:53.205 --> 10:55.845
- or, hang on, maybe it was the...
- Doesn't matter, Colm.

10:55.925 --> 10:57.285
Well, it was one of the two.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.245
He's looking for the keys to the van,

10:59.325 --> 11:02.925
all ranting and raving
and getting himself all worked up,

11:03.005 --> 11:06.645
threatening to set fire
to my good chaise longue and all sorts.

11:07.085 --> 11:10.725
By Jesus, they were absolutely desperate
to borrow the van.

11:10.805 --> 11:12.885
Colm, they didn't "borrow" your van.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.205
They stole your van,

11:14.285 --> 11:16.205
used it to move arms
across the border,

11:16.285 --> 11:17.365
and then they blew it up.

11:17.445 --> 11:19.645
Aye. Nightmare altogether.

11:19.725 --> 11:22.205
Or <i> diabolique, </i> as they say in France.

11:22.285 --> 11:24.725
Or, "You're still not going to Paris,"
as they say in Derry.

11:24.805 --> 11:26.965
Ach, well, I'm delighted for you, Colm.

11:27.045 --> 11:29.445
- What?
- Well, I just mean that,

11:29.525 --> 11:32.765
well, before he had nothing
really going for him,

11:32.845 --> 11:36.325
but now, well, now he is somebody.

11:36.405 --> 11:39.565
Now he's the fella
that got tied to his own radiator.

11:39.645 --> 11:41.565
- Thanks, Sarah.
- We should ring UTV,

11:41.645 --> 11:43.405
get them to do an interview.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.285
When Shauna Sharkey was interviewed...

11:45.365 --> 11:47.765
do you mind the time where
her and her brother got hijacked?

11:47.845 --> 11:50.485
Well, Fionnula gave her free chips
for a month.

11:50.565 --> 11:52.485
- You're joking.
- Honest to God.

11:52.565 --> 11:54.005
I'll go.

11:57.085 --> 12:00.925
You will never guess
what she's done this time, Erin.

12:01.005 --> 12:03.565
Did she nick the noticeboard
from the chip shop, Clare?

12:05.605 --> 12:07.845
<i>♪ You're unbelievable ♪</i>

12:07.925 --> 12:09.885
Fionnula was out the back, cashing up.

12:09.965 --> 12:13.245
I sneaked in, yanked it off the wall
and away I went.

12:13.325 --> 12:15.325
I was like a thief in the night.

12:16.525 --> 12:18.405
You were "like" a thief in the night?

12:18.485 --> 12:20.645
You actually were a thief in the night,

12:20.725 --> 12:22.885
and you stole from Fionnula,
of all people.

12:22.965 --> 12:23.965
Fionnula!

12:24.045 --> 12:26.485
I once saw her punch a Rottweiler,
Michelle.

12:26.565 --> 12:28.765
If she finds out about this,
she'll kill you.

12:28.845 --> 12:31.605
Kill us. You're an accessory
after the fact now,

12:31.685 --> 12:33.125
- my friend.
- God!

12:33.205 --> 12:35.325
Can I ask why you stole the noticeboard?

12:35.405 --> 12:37.365
So we get first dibs on all the jobs.

12:37.445 --> 12:40.845
Wouldn't it have been easier
to just remove the notices?

12:40.925 --> 12:42.805
They're only Blu Tacked on.

12:44.365 --> 12:45.485
Fuck off, dickweed.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.445
Christ, what possessed you,
Michelle?

12:47.525 --> 12:50.645
Yeah, the more I talk about it
and the more I sober up...

12:51.405 --> 12:53.605
- the less sure I am, really.
- You were drunk?

12:53.685 --> 12:55.005
Brilliant!

12:55.085 --> 12:57.325
Fuck. We're not like Jenny Joyce.

12:57.405 --> 12:59.965
Nobody is just going to hand us things.

13:00.045 --> 13:02.765
But that doesn't mean
we shouldn't have things.

13:02.845 --> 13:04.285
Come on, Clare.

13:06.085 --> 13:08.925
I know how much you've dreamed
of seeing the Arc de...

13:09.005 --> 13:10.645
whatever the fuck it's called.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.125
James...

13:13.165 --> 13:16.285
I know how much you want to practice
the shit out of the past participle.

13:16.685 --> 13:17.685
Orla...

13:19.365 --> 13:22.125
you really, really buzz
off those Renault Clio ads.

13:22.885 --> 13:23.965
And you, Erin.

13:24.485 --> 13:28.205
Well... you're just riding
Charlene Kavanagh.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.685
I'm not riding her.

13:29.765 --> 13:32.645
I just think it might be time I moved on,
friendship-wise.

13:32.725 --> 13:34.805
You are aware you're talking
to your current friends?

13:36.565 --> 13:37.965
We can't give up on Paris.

13:38.045 --> 13:40.725
Let's do this, girls.
Let's just make it happen.

13:40.805 --> 13:42.605
God, I've never seen you so fired up.

13:42.685 --> 13:44.845
I will buck a French lad, Erin.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.085
I will buck a French lad,
so help me God.

13:49.445 --> 13:52.205
So, firstly we have the tutoring.

13:52.285 --> 13:53.645
And out of everyone,

13:53.725 --> 13:56.405
I thought you might be best suited to
that, Clare, because...

13:56.485 --> 13:57.845
I'm the brightest.

13:57.925 --> 14:00.885
Well, in that conventional sort of way,
I suppose.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.325
There's also some babysitting.

14:02.405 --> 14:03.525
The child will be in bed,

14:03.605 --> 14:06.565
so you should just about be able
to manage that, Michelle.

14:06.645 --> 14:09.525
Oh, thanks. And you should
just about be able to manage this.

14:09.605 --> 14:11.005
Always the lady.

14:11.085 --> 14:14.485
There's also some gardening,
mowing a lawn, et cetera.

14:14.565 --> 14:17.205
This will require a bit of muscle, so...

14:17.885 --> 14:20.005
you should take that one, Orla.

14:20.085 --> 14:21.885
No, I should do that one.

14:21.965 --> 14:23.645
It's a man's job, Erin. I'm a man.

14:23.725 --> 14:26.165
- That's debatable.
- I'm more of a man than Orla.

14:26.245 --> 14:28.285
I do not accept that.

14:28.365 --> 14:29.485
Come on, Erin.

14:29.565 --> 14:33.525
Fine. So, that leaves dog-walking and
washing a car.

14:33.605 --> 14:34.885
Is it a Renault Clio?

14:34.965 --> 14:37.685
- No.
- I'll take the dogs.

14:37.765 --> 14:38.965
Okay.

14:42.325 --> 14:43.845
Let's go to work.

- How did you find out?
- Doesn't matter how she found out.

15:20.445 --> 15:23.685
That's not what's important, what's
important is that we are all deeply...

15:23.765 --> 15:26.605
- Her mother rang me.
- You told your ma?

15:26.685 --> 15:28.845
Okay, I cracked.

15:28.925 --> 15:30.485
I couldn't handle it, and I cracked.

15:30.565 --> 15:32.605
- For fuck's sake, Clare.
- Enough!

15:33.125 --> 15:34.405
Where do we go from here?

15:34.485 --> 15:37.005
Mary, look, you're family.

15:37.485 --> 15:39.005
Well, you're good people.

15:39.365 --> 15:40.565
Well, you're decent people.

15:41.205 --> 15:42.485
But I have to set an example.

15:43.045 --> 15:44.605
No. Dear God, no.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.285
You're not talking about a ban.

15:46.365 --> 15:47.565
Yes.

15:47.645 --> 15:50.045
Let's call it a suspension.
I'm sorry, Mary.

15:50.125 --> 15:53.725
Ach, Fionnula. What about you?
I thought I could smell vinegar.

15:53.805 --> 15:58.805
I'm just on my way to meet our Colm here.
I'm a nervous wreck.

15:58.885 --> 16:01.885
We're doing this interview, you see,
for UTV.

16:01.965 --> 16:05.005
- I'm going to be on UTV, Fionnula.
- Save your breath, Sarah.

16:05.085 --> 16:07.005
There'll be no free chips.

16:07.085 --> 16:08.645
There'll be no chips, full stop.

16:08.725 --> 16:10.245
Excuse me?

16:10.325 --> 16:12.565
What do you expect me to do on a Friday,
Fionnula? Cook?

16:12.645 --> 16:14.925
- You expect me to cook?
- You could order a pizza.

16:15.005 --> 16:16.725
- Pizza is not as nice.
- No.

16:16.805 --> 16:20.045
You are right, Orla.
Pizza is not as nice.

16:20.125 --> 16:22.005
Maybe you should have
all thought about that.

16:23.845 --> 16:25.445
Is there nothing we can do?

16:28.445 --> 16:31.285
So, not only are we not going to Paris,

16:31.365 --> 16:34.405
we're spending our Sunday scrubbing
Fionnula's fucking fish hole for free.

16:34.485 --> 16:37.445
Aye, and she'll be back from Eucharist
soon, so get a shift on.

16:37.525 --> 16:38.965
It's slave labor, Erin.

16:39.045 --> 16:42.325
It's worse than slave labor.
We're not even getting paid.

16:42.405 --> 16:43.901
Look, Mammy had to cut some sort of deal.

16:43.925 --> 16:46.525
Would living without fried food
really be so bad?

16:46.605 --> 16:47.645
Yes!

16:49.045 --> 16:50.501
She wouldn't actually have banned us.
She was bluffing.

16:50.525 --> 16:52.005
She's not bluffing, Michelle.

16:52.085 --> 16:54.805
- Didn't she ban the McGuigan twins?
- Seriously?

16:54.885 --> 16:56.805
Sure. That's why they lost all the weight.

16:57.845 --> 17:00.205
Right, girls. No dicking about.

17:02.365 --> 17:05.005
We need to leave this place

How?

17:59.405 --> 18:01.605
How is it still sticky?

18:02.285 --> 18:04.565
Is it worse than when we started?

18:06.725 --> 18:08.285
I think it might be, yeah.

18:08.365 --> 18:10.725
- Great.
- Oh, I see.

18:11.245 --> 18:14.005
Yeah. This isn't Windolene.

18:14.085 --> 18:15.085
This is...

18:16.125 --> 18:17.445
This is mayonnaise.

18:18.085 --> 18:19.245
Great work, folks.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.045
Absolutely brilliant.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.605
Well done, everyone.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.245
It's been a productive morning.

18:26.325 --> 18:29.085
Fionnula will be absolutely thrilled.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.965
All right?

18:55.445 --> 18:56.965
Boo!

18:57.045 --> 18:59.645
- Where did you get all this?
- Fionnula's cupboard.

18:59.725 --> 19:01.805
I think she might have a bit of a problem.

19:01.885 --> 19:04.605
You think Fionnula
might have a bit of a problem?

19:04.685 --> 19:07.045
Put it away and get back downstairs, now.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.965
- Sit yourselves down. Have a wee drink.
- No, Michelle. It's wrong.

19:10.045 --> 19:13.125
So are those ski pants, Clare, didn't stop
you pulling them over your hole.

19:14.085 --> 19:15.125
Wait for it.

19:18.205 --> 19:21.165
- Michelle!
- Don't be a shower of bore bags.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.085
Sláinte, motherfuckers.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.285
- No, no, no, no!
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

19:40.205 --> 19:43.885
Are you throwing alcohol on it?
Are you actually throwing alcohol on it?

19:43.965 --> 19:46.285
And what in the name of God
are you doing, seasoning it?

20:06.965 --> 20:08.565
Wow.

20:08.645 --> 20:12.445
On a scale of one to ten,
how dead do you think we are?

20:15.125 --> 20:17.685
<i>The taller fella.
Well, it was one of the two.</i>

20:17.765 --> 20:20.165
<i>Anyway, he says to me, says he...</i>

20:20.245 --> 20:23.205
- It's the truth, Mammy.
- Erin, if you expect me to believe

20:23.285 --> 20:25.605
that Michelle tripped
while carrying a scented candle,

20:25.685 --> 20:27.605
you must think I came up
the Foyle in a bubble.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.565
<i>My uncle
still finds it all quite difficult</i>

20:30.645 --> 20:32.565
<i>- to talk about.</i>
- It's my bit! It's my bit!

20:32.645 --> 20:36.365
- What are we going to do?
- Oh, for God's sake, Mary, would you look?

20:36.445 --> 20:38.085
You're missing my big moment.

20:38.165 --> 20:40.965
<i>Two gunmen of roughly the same height</i>

20:41.045 --> 20:44.445
<i>kicked his door down
and tied him to the radiator</i>

20:44.525 --> 20:46.205
<i>with his own shoelaces.</i>

20:46.285 --> 20:49.725
<i>He'd barely had those shoelaces
a week, John.</i>

20:49.805 --> 20:52.405
<i>They threatened him
with physical violence.</i>

20:52.485 --> 20:57.845
<i>They threatened to burn his house down
before manhandling...</i>

21:06.285 --> 21:08.805
Why would two gunmen break into a chippy?

21:08.885 --> 21:10.885
Ah! That really hurt.

21:10.965 --> 21:13.125
- You're such a pussy.
- What were they looking for?

21:13.205 --> 21:14.565
Chips, obviously.

21:14.645 --> 21:17.125
They were looking for the keys to the van.
Keep up, Erin.

21:17.205 --> 21:19.005
Do you think we should
knock them about a bit?

21:19.885 --> 21:22.725
- No.
- Nothing drastic. Just a few slaps.

21:22.805 --> 21:24.085
I said no, Sarah.

21:24.165 --> 21:26.965
- What, not even the wee gay fella?
- I'm not gay.

21:27.045 --> 21:30.005
Okay, that should do it. Ready?

21:30.085 --> 21:31.845
I hate to be a health and safety stickler,

21:31.925 --> 21:34.605
but surely you're not actually planning
on leaving us, are you?

21:37.765 --> 21:40.125
Back door.
Back door. Back door.

21:40.845 --> 21:42.365
Hurry up.

21:55.525 --> 21:58.245
Push it, push it.

21:58.325 --> 22:00.765
- I'm pushing! I'm pushing it!
- Hurry up!

22:00.845 --> 22:02.525
It's locked!

22:08.045 --> 22:10.525
What the fuck's going on here, exactly?

22:10.605 --> 22:12.085
Okay...

22:12.725 --> 22:14.245
um, all right.

22:15.365 --> 22:17.805
Well, what happened was...

22:19.045 --> 22:22.005
Michelle was carrying
this scented candle...

22:25.325 --> 22:26.765
It's just not as nice.
