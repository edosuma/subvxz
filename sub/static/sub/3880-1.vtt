HAPPINESS FOR SALE

02:23.743 --> 02:24.802
Is it sold?

02:24.911 --> 02:26.504
<i>Not exactly.</i>

02:26.579 --> 02:29.105
I dropped the premium
and twenty grand.

02:29.182 --> 02:30.411
What's the problem?

02:30.517 --> 02:31.985
<i>I told you!</i>

02:32.185 --> 02:33.915
<i>- It's closed!</i>
- Hey!

02:34.020 --> 02:35.044
Where's your mom?

02:35.121 --> 02:38.182
<i>Someone has to be there to show it!</i>

02:38.458 --> 02:39.517
<i>Right?</i>

02:39.792 --> 02:40.919
Look.

02:41.127 --> 02:43.790
Have you been slacking off and

02:43.897 --> 02:45.422
hanging out the cafe again?

02:46.299 --> 02:47.323
<i>What?</i>

02:47.400 --> 02:49.198
And have you memorized your lines?

02:49.536 --> 02:53.200
You say the exact same thing
every single time.

02:53.239 --> 02:55.834
<i>Your dad's ill
so you need to be here.</i>

02:55.875 --> 02:58.572
I can't.
That's why I hired you.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.840
<i>- You're the only one in the family.</i>
- Whatever.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.542
I'm hanging up!

03:05.885 --> 03:08.286
SAY NO TO JUNK FOOD

03:10.290 --> 03:11.519
Hello sir!

03:11.591 --> 03:13.184
- I got your wedding invitation.
- Thank you.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.853
Heard she's young.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.795
Kind of.

03:17.897 --> 03:20.457
- How young is she?
- Ten years younger than me.

03:22.468 --> 03:23.902
She's a baby!

03:24.003 --> 03:26.472
- It's so embarrassing!
- Heard she's hot!

03:26.573 --> 03:28.542
Of course she is!
She's a decade younger!

03:28.641 --> 03:30.109
Come on!

03:36.816 --> 03:38.614
Read it later.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.490
What are the flowers for?

03:53.032 --> 03:58.130
It's our 100th day today.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.785
Damn you!

04:28.868 --> 04:30.063
Asshole!

04:44.284 --> 04:48.221
Mr. LEE Jae-geun!
Mr. LEE Jae-geun!

04:49.656 --> 04:51.284
Mr. LEE!

04:51.424 --> 04:53.757
Hey, LEE!
Hey!

05:00.600 --> 05:01.898
Ouch!

05:13.212 --> 05:14.475
Mr. LEE Jae-geun?

05:15.181 --> 05:17.446
I'm from the provincial tax office.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.358
I'm not LEE Jae-geun.

05:26.359 --> 05:28.055
Yes, you are.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.291
LEE JAE-GEUN

05:32.265 --> 05:34.427
You know you have
unpaid property tax?

05:34.834 --> 05:36.666
I don't have any property.

05:36.736 --> 05:39.797
You sure live in a nice area.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.499
Your house must've gone up in price.

05:41.574 --> 05:44.510
This is my wife's house.
Check the documents!

05:44.677 --> 05:47.237
Wow! Did you buy a new car?

05:47.313 --> 05:49.043
I won it in a draw!

05:49.148 --> 05:52.346
I guess you could afford
the tax for that!

05:52.418 --> 05:54.444
I'm busy.
Come later.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.680
- When?
- Later.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.622
So you can run away again?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.718
I'm not like that.

06:00.827 --> 06:03.194
You ran for the last two years.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.825
Don't you trust anyone?

06:08.101 --> 06:09.694
Everyone but you.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.103
Fine.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.101
Stay right here.

06:15.174 --> 06:16.437
- Don't move.
- Sure!

06:16.509 --> 06:19.240
- Don't you go anywhere!
- Don't you worry!

06:19.779 --> 06:21.077
Geez!

06:35.862 --> 06:38.855
There you go, you bitch!

07:31.717 --> 07:35.484
Why!

07:36.022 --> 07:36.921
What!

07:37.023 --> 07:39.158
What the hell did I do?

07:39.158 --> 07:40.126
What?

07:40.993 --> 07:42.825
You looking down on girls?

07:42.895 --> 07:43.828
What?

07:43.963 --> 07:46.091
Looking down on me
cuz I'm not young and pretty?

07:46.332 --> 07:48.198
Cuz I'm not driving
an expensive car?

07:48.301 --> 07:48.996
What the hell?

07:49.068 --> 07:51.094
You men are all pigs!

07:51.804 --> 07:55.366
You think a girl's nothing
without money and power?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.536
You think you
I'm some toy or something?

08:00.713 --> 08:01.806
Fuck!

08:02.315 --> 08:04.511
What did I do?

08:06.285 --> 08:08.914
What the hell did I do?

08:33.145 --> 08:34.510
Hey!

08:40.119 --> 08:41.417
Hey!

08:48.294 --> 08:49.262
Name.

08:50.496 --> 08:51.930
KANG Mi-na.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.899
Ms. KANG.
What's your job?

08:57.403 --> 08:59.770
- Job!
- Government employee.

08:59.872 --> 09:00.965
Really?

09:01.340 --> 09:04.868
So who pays for your salary?

09:05.411 --> 09:08.870
- Who?
- The people.

09:08.981 --> 09:10.540
People?

09:11.417 --> 09:13.852
That's right!

09:14.253 --> 09:17.519
So you threaten them
and hit and run?

09:17.590 --> 09:20.685
That's cuz he wouldn't
get out of his car.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.992
So you charged after Mr. LEE
outside of his car?

09:24.163 --> 09:25.256
- Let me explain.
- Enough!

09:26.933 --> 09:29.129
- Two months suspension!
- Sir!

09:29.201 --> 09:31.363
That was attempted murder!

09:31.537 --> 09:33.870
You can go to jail for this.

09:33.973 --> 09:36.408
You're lucky you're only getting

09:36.475 --> 09:39.035
two months suspended.
Go!

09:39.211 --> 09:43.876
Don't stick around the area
and piss people off.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.851
Take a break for good
out of the province.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.309
Yes, he's my dad.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.883
Loan?
How much?

10:25.725 --> 10:27.853
He'll pay you back.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.527
When he's out of the hospital.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.662
I dunno.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.901
Damn it!

10:36.469 --> 10:39.928
Why should I pay for
what he bought?

10:40.106 --> 10:42.075
How did you get this number?

10:42.174 --> 10:46.236
Yeah, okay, ma'am.

10:46.746 --> 10:50.046
I work for the government.

10:50.583 --> 10:54.042
I can't just take time off.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.385
You want me to quit my job?

10:56.455 --> 11:00.859
Then who'd pay for you to look
after my dad at the hospital?

11:01.994 --> 11:03.986
<i>I know it's hard for you, Mi-na.</i>

11:04.096 --> 11:07.533
So just sell the shop, please!

11:07.600 --> 11:09.796
<i>There is no one at the shop!</i>

11:09.902 --> 11:13.202
I can't go there!
I won't!

11:13.272 --> 11:16.333
You know what
took me to get here.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.872
You congratulated me
when I got this job.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.544
<i>You still need to be here.</i>

11:20.646 --> 11:25.141
Why should I go there?
What about my job?

12:17.503 --> 12:19.062
Shit.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.803
FAMOUS REAL ESTATE OFFICE

12:25.745 --> 12:28.909
Good for you for coming here!

12:30.382 --> 12:35.719
You gotta open up the shop
if you wanna sell it.

12:36.489 --> 12:39.084
- I'm giving you two months.
- Huh?

12:40.326 --> 12:42.761
Sure.
That's plenty.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.198
Did you go see your dad?

12:49.702 --> 12:52.297
You're the only one he's got.

12:52.371 --> 12:56.001
- Your food's getting cold.
- Okay.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.810
MUJU HOSPITAL

13:16.362 --> 13:20.823
I just went blank
and passed out.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.927
- I put out the shop for sale.
- What?

13:24.003 --> 13:26.438
You're in no condition
to run it anyway.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.401
What you saying?
No way.

13:29.675 --> 13:31.405
Then what?

13:31.610 --> 13:35.706
How will you pay for the goods?
And your hospital fees?

13:35.781 --> 13:39.741
- When I get out...
- You'll borrow money again?

13:40.719 --> 13:43.018
You should've closed it down.

13:43.122 --> 13:47.492
Who gets a loan to keep a
corner shop running?

13:47.660 --> 13:50.562
If you can't pay back,
I would have to.

13:50.696 --> 13:53.723
- So don't!
- I said no!

13:53.799 --> 13:57.133
- Then don't turn out like this!
- I said no!

13:57.469 --> 14:00.439
That's my shop!
You go back home!

14:00.806 --> 14:04.834
What the hell is that
corner shop to you?

14:09.148 --> 14:13.984
You opened that shop
even the day after mom died.

14:18.657 --> 14:20.717
It was sports day at the school.

14:21.627 --> 14:26.827
I had all the kids' cheering props
and uniforms at the shop.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.532
That's important to you?
Kids' sports day?

14:31.604 --> 14:33.505
Then mess up their day?

14:34.440 --> 14:38.309
You know how hard
they worked for that day?

14:39.511 --> 14:42.276
I'm sick of this.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.280
I'm selling the shop.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.876
If you don't like it, get up
and pay for it yourself.

My name is CHOI Kang-ho.
I'm the new teacher for Gr. 4.

17:24.843 --> 17:30.146
I'm so happy to return
to my old school to teach here.

17:30.983 --> 17:37.321
I look forward to
our year together.

17:40.592 --> 17:41.616
Damn it.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.895
Who's the Gr. 4 teacher?

17:45.097 --> 17:46.190
Who is it?

17:47.733 --> 17:48.826
Me, sir.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.431
Right?

18:00.112 --> 18:01.239
Here.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.081
Thank you.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.580
What does that
student's father do?

18:07.653 --> 18:09.281
He runs a Taekwondo school.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.117
And his son gets beat up?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.415
Doesn't he teach
him Taekwondo?

18:15.894 --> 18:18.887
I'm sorry this happened
on your first day.

18:18.964 --> 18:20.296
That's okay.

18:21.867 --> 18:22.968
PARK So-young...

18:22.968 --> 18:26.405
She's the one who hit him.
She comes from a bad family.

18:26.572 --> 18:31.476
Since you're from Seoul you know
how kids are these days.

18:31.577 --> 18:32.704
Brats!

18:34.279 --> 18:37.044
We should just transfer her!

19:01.640 --> 19:03.541
Send me to Seoul!

19:03.642 --> 19:07.443
I hate it here!

19:14.486 --> 19:17.354
<i>I can still hear them now.</i>

19:17.789 --> 19:19.155
You're a stinky corn chip!

19:19.224 --> 19:21.625
My name is KANG Mi-na!

19:21.693 --> 19:24.754
I'm not a corn chip!

19:24.863 --> 19:28.595
Never ever eat junky
snacks like this!

19:28.667 --> 19:33.367
Then Mi-na's dad is really bad
cuz he sells them!

19:37.576 --> 19:39.067
<i>I tried everything.</i>

19:39.878 --> 19:43.110
- I cried.
<i>- My name is Mi-na!</i>

19:43.549 --> 19:46.280
I don't stink!

19:46.385 --> 19:49.014
Say my name!
KANG Mi-na!

19:49.087 --> 19:50.088
<i>I threatened them.</i>

19:50.088 --> 19:52.717
If you don't, I'll jump!

19:52.791 --> 19:55.283
My name is KANG Mi-na.
Call me Mi-na.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.295
Who wants this cute pencil?

19:57.362 --> 19:59.297
<i>I even bribed them.
But it didn't work.</i>

19:59.364 --> 20:01.765
Thanks, corn chip!

20:03.168 --> 20:05.069
Thank you, corn chip!

20:07.206 --> 20:11.473
Want Mimi paper doll or
24 color crayons?

I hate you the most
in this world!

20:18.517 --> 20:21.919
Cuz of you,
kids call me corn chip!

20:26.858 --> 20:29.794
<i>I hated his laughter the most.</i>

20:29.828 --> 20:30.921
Jang-mi!

20:33.432 --> 20:35.424
- Your shoelaces are untied.
- Huh?

20:37.936 --> 20:39.234
Look, Jang-mi.

20:39.938 --> 20:41.463
- Ta-da!
- Wow!

20:43.242 --> 20:44.642
Thank you!

20:53.518 --> 20:54.542
Mi-na?

21:05.597 --> 21:07.259
Mi-na's Corn Shop

21:28.520 --> 21:30.682
Are they open again?

21:32.691 --> 21:34.887
What's all this?

21:35.560 --> 21:39.053
The little brats still steal?

21:39.231 --> 21:41.996
Daewang Food?
Geez.

21:42.067 --> 21:45.469
They really screw
around with food.

21:45.537 --> 21:46.937
Can I help you?

21:47.039 --> 21:48.098
Hi.

21:49.941 --> 21:51.671
New owner, huh?

21:51.910 --> 21:57.042
My name is JANG Man-seok.
I'm the sales director of Mana Food.

21:57.282 --> 21:59.046
We sell taste of love
and tradition!

21:59.318 --> 22:03.949
The good old chain candy!

22:04.056 --> 22:08.619
We're different from these
junky confectionary companies.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.220
We've been around for
three generations!

22:11.563 --> 22:13.293
Take a look!

22:13.365 --> 22:19.168
No one can put a swirl
in the candy like we do!

22:19.237 --> 22:21.229
Not everyone can make junk food.

22:21.306 --> 22:23.207
Only crooks can.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.402
This isn't junk food.

22:25.477 --> 22:27.844
It got government approval!

22:27.946 --> 22:29.107
A-ha!

22:29.214 --> 22:31.308
- Is it the Love Potion?
- Wow!

22:31.750 --> 22:33.480
You know the Love Potion?

22:33.552 --> 22:35.987
It was a hit last year!

22:36.054 --> 22:37.322
Want some in your store?

22:37.322 --> 22:39.553
Kids got that confused
with rat poison, right?

22:39.624 --> 22:44.619
Yeah, but a lot of rats got
confused and died, too!

22:44.763 --> 22:48.928
Not only is your company old,
but it also uses expired ingredients.

22:48.967 --> 22:53.302
The candies lost
government approval.

22:54.473 --> 22:56.669
And you're still dealing them?

22:56.742 --> 22:57.937
Boy, it's hot!

22:58.009 --> 23:00.604
Hello, Food Safety Division,
please.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.978
I'm selling good products here.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.540
Food Safety?

23:06.118 --> 23:10.488
I'm the expert on

23:10.789 --> 23:13.782
food and safety, damn it!

23:36.014 --> 23:37.539
<i>There was this man.</i>

23:42.220 --> 23:46.715
<i>He was the man of all men</i>

23:46.825 --> 23:50.057
<i>whose very presence
stupified others.</i>

23:50.762 --> 23:55.223
<i>He was like my hero.</i>

23:55.867 --> 23:59.429
<i>He reminded me of invincible Kyle
from Street Fighters.</i>

24:01.940 --> 24:05.536
<i>Was there anyone who can
possibly stand in his way?</i>

24:06.244 --> 24:07.303
Freeze!

24:11.716 --> 24:12.775
<i>There was.</i>

24:17.322 --> 24:20.224
<i>My dream changed from that day</i>

24:20.559 --> 24:25.964
<i>to become the man who
arrests men like him.</i>

24:26.198 --> 24:30.932
<i>To become the unbeatable detective
CHOI Kang-ho!</i>

24:32.270 --> 24:36.605
<i>But I ended up becoming
a school teacher.</i>

24:51.323 --> 24:52.450
The key!

25:02.033 --> 25:03.399
What?

25:05.537 --> 25:06.561
Wow!

25:08.206 --> 25:11.108
It's open!

25:19.518 --> 25:21.680
What's all this?

25:21.887 --> 25:24.857
Is this better than Miffy click pen?

25:24.923 --> 25:25.788
Dunno.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.155
This is too expensive.

25:27.225 --> 25:30.423
Where is graph paper, ma'am?
Tell me!

25:30.495 --> 25:33.363
Where is colored paper?

25:33.431 --> 25:36.799
Don't have any.
Go elsewhere.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.099
Who are you, ma'am?

25:39.170 --> 25:42.402
I'm not ma'am.
I'm miss.

25:42.474 --> 25:45.034
Are you the owner now?

25:45.610 --> 25:49.069
You think I'd run this stink hole?

25:50.081 --> 25:51.344
It's part-time.

25:52.651 --> 25:56.088
- Is that better than the owner?
- No duh!

25:56.588 --> 25:59.319
Do you have Charac Charac Change
sketchbook?

25:59.424 --> 26:03.919
Can I swap the yellow in this
with the red in this?

26:04.029 --> 26:05.122
No.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.492
Where's Mr. KANG?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.560
He's dead.

26:18.109 --> 26:21.511
Cashier, quick!
I'm late for cleaning at school.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.176
Hey! I was here first!

26:25.283 --> 26:28.481
- Wanna die?
- You little!

26:28.553 --> 26:29.816
- I was here first!
- You brats!

26:29.888 --> 26:32.255
Quick fighting and get lost!

26:32.290 --> 26:35.283
Get out!
Out!

26:37.495 --> 26:40.260
I said go elsewhere!

26:41.600 --> 26:44.502
Why you little!
Out! Out!

26:44.569 --> 26:47.129
I said get out!

26:47.205 --> 26:49.765
Out! Out!

26:49.874 --> 26:54.608
- Get out!
- I have to buy something!

26:56.948 --> 26:58.780
Why are you crying?

27:00.752 --> 27:03.551
- Get lost!
- I said I was here first!

27:03.588 --> 27:05.250
The corner shop's open!

27:06.257 --> 27:08.453
- I'll kick your ass!
- Don't come back!

27:09.661 --> 27:11.630
- Shit!
- Hey!

27:11.696 --> 27:14.029
- He's a criminal!
- Let's go!

27:23.541 --> 27:24.531
Look!

27:24.709 --> 27:28.441
I'm actually a teacher here.

27:28.513 --> 27:29.378
Right.

27:29.447 --> 27:32.849
- These are fake!
- Sure.

27:32.917 --> 27:35.853
- I was playing Cops and Robbers.
- Come with us.

27:37.022 --> 27:40.789
This won't work.
Call someone.

27:41.993 --> 27:45.293
So when is the key coming?

27:45.330 --> 27:48.892
- They just shipped it.
- Damn it!

27:49.000 --> 27:52.095
You should've used
express service!

27:53.672 --> 27:56.437
Oh, yeah!

27:58.376 --> 28:00.140
Why didn't I think of that?

28:40.719 --> 28:44.884
URGENT SALE

29:13.184 --> 29:14.379
Look.

29:14.719 --> 29:17.188
I'm not a weirdo or anything.

29:17.522 --> 29:20.253
Come here.

29:20.425 --> 29:21.552
It's okay.

29:24.229 --> 29:25.492
Look!

29:26.397 --> 29:27.729
Get lost!

29:27.766 --> 29:29.132
I'm just...

29:33.304 --> 29:36.103
- Just listen!
- I said go away!

29:36.207 --> 29:37.197
Go away!

29:37.308 --> 29:40.403
Just listen for a minute!

29:40.812 --> 29:42.246
Get lost, you freak!

29:42.680 --> 29:44.581
I'm a teacher!

29:45.083 --> 29:46.016
Wait! Wait!

29:46.084 --> 29:48.986
Okay, I'll go!

29:49.154 --> 29:53.148
You crazy monster!

29:53.458 --> 29:55.051
Geez!

29:59.297 --> 30:03.132
This is so pretty!
So is this!

30:03.535 --> 30:04.102
SORRY

30:04.102 --> 30:06.071
But I don't like the color.

30:06.771 --> 30:09.832
- Then how about this?
- Nah.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.275
- Let's get this one.
- Okay!

30:17.248 --> 30:18.876
How much is this?

30:20.518 --> 30:21.542
A dollar.

30:23.054 --> 30:25.717
I knew it.
It's a big rock.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.029
How about this one?

30:32.597 --> 30:35.499
The color's too strong.

30:35.567 --> 30:38.696
- Then this?
- I don't like the shape.

30:38.736 --> 30:40.967
How about this one?

30:41.506 --> 30:44.135
- Let's go with this.
- Yeah!

30:44.943 --> 30:50.041
We'll take these.
They're 50 cents, right?

30:55.587 --> 30:58.819
You know that's made of lead?

30:58.890 --> 31:00.324
You know lead?

31:00.658 --> 31:02.320
If you wear that
when you're young

31:02.427 --> 31:06.455
you might lose your
wedding finger later.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.764
No refunds on opened products.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.605
Sorry.
I'll buy you next time.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.033
That's okay.

31:23.915 --> 31:28.751
You can't find a better deal
for that money.

31:28.820 --> 31:32.916
No premium, it's in front of a school,
and the owner's nice.

31:33.024 --> 31:36.153
But it's filled with junk.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.594
We're opening a franchise shop.

31:38.696 --> 31:42.292
Don't worry.
I'll get rid of everything.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.631
What's the problem?

31:44.736 --> 31:48.696
Refunds are legal within
14 days of purchase.

31:48.773 --> 31:50.366
The box isn't open.

31:51.376 --> 31:53.038
Look at the receipt.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.847
It's only been 13 days, right?

31:56.781 --> 31:59.307
Thanks.

32:01.319 --> 32:06.587
Do you have any clay?

32:11.596 --> 32:15.465
In the corner.
It's 90 cents.

32:20.004 --> 32:22.633
What's this?
It's new?

32:23.474 --> 32:26.034
There're so many scratches on it!

32:27.078 --> 32:29.274
It looks used.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.280
- Doesn't it?
- Yeah.

32:33.384 --> 32:35.148
This is so lame.

32:35.720 --> 32:38.053
Who likes Top Blade these days?

32:38.523 --> 32:40.082
- Right?
- Right!

32:43.761 --> 32:47.254
Look at all this glue.
It's defective.

32:47.432 --> 32:48.866
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

32:51.069 --> 32:52.662
How much is this?

32:53.004 --> 32:54.597
Three dollars.

32:54.806 --> 32:58.641
What?
That's three dollars?

32:58.743 --> 33:01.406
It's $2.50 down the street.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.380
- Right?
- Yeah.

33:03.948 --> 33:06.042
- What a rip off!
- Let's go down the street.

33:09.220 --> 33:10.188
You!

33:11.222 --> 33:12.520
Is that good?

33:12.790 --> 33:15.021
Yeah.
Really good.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.962
They sell it at the corner shop
down the street.

33:18.029 --> 33:19.395
Why don't you sell it?

33:19.497 --> 33:25.494
Cuz it's made of ground up
chicken heads.

33:27.538 --> 33:32.340
Careful you don't choke on
eye balls or beaks.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.778
But that's probably lean meat.

33:38.216 --> 33:39.411
Pigeon meat.

33:44.155 --> 33:46.590
Where were the jumping ropes?

33:50.661 --> 33:52.653
Fuck!
Who opened this?

33:56.401 --> 33:57.733
- Ten!
- Eleven!

33:57.835 --> 33:59.963
- Who the fuck!
- Fourteen!

34:05.076 --> 34:06.237
What are you doing here?

34:06.878 --> 34:10.143
Why aren't you going home?
School's finished.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.274
We're waiting for the bus.

34:12.449 --> 34:15.284
Who said you can wait here?

34:15.620 --> 34:18.248
This is where they pick us up!

34:18.489 --> 34:21.789
Look at this garbage!
Get lost!

34:21.859 --> 34:24.954
But Mr. KANG said
we can wait here.

34:25.029 --> 34:25.897
Yeah!

34:25.897 --> 34:27.331
I said get lost!

34:31.235 --> 34:32.362
Geez!

34:34.772 --> 34:36.364
Everything's okay at the office?

34:37.909 --> 34:39.309
What?

34:39.409 --> 34:43.245
Someone's been taking the coins
from the coin box?

34:44.949 --> 34:48.112
What a stinge ball!

34:53.858 --> 34:58.228
People like that should be
punished for three generations!

35:00.098 --> 35:02.067
Don't worry.

35:02.366 --> 35:06.326
Once I sell this place,
I'll catch him for ya.

35:06.437 --> 35:07.564
Bye.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.900
Geez!

35:18.549 --> 35:23.078
Don't call me for things like this.
Just buy them and I'll pay.

35:23.521 --> 35:26.389
It's hard to buy men's underwear.

35:26.991 --> 35:29.051
Aren't you gonna see your father?

35:29.861 --> 35:32.353
We'd just end up fighting.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.344
Don't sit here!

35:46.344 --> 35:51.749
<i>No one dare goes near her.
I wonder if she's really that bad.</i>

35:59.924 --> 36:01.392
<i>Who is she?</i>

36:04.996 --> 36:09.263
Listen carefully, everyone!

36:09.367 --> 36:11.029
Very carefully!

36:11.569 --> 36:12.969
- Once more!
- Right.

36:14.438 --> 36:19.138
I don't expect all that much
from you guys.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.974
You don't have to excel in school.

36:23.481 --> 36:28.078
Nor be a good athlete unless
you're competing in Olympics.

36:28.719 --> 36:29.846
But!

36:30.188 --> 36:34.353
Do not bother
or punch your friends!

36:37.228 --> 36:38.594
PARK So-young!

36:40.031 --> 36:44.765
You think you're so special
sitting there alone?

36:45.203 --> 36:46.432
Get over here.

36:46.571 --> 36:47.834
Shit.

36:48.339 --> 36:54.040
People like that
will not be forgiven.

36:54.512 --> 36:57.072
- Got it?
- Yes.

36:57.215 --> 37:01.311
Don't forget your
recorders tomorrow!

37:01.385 --> 37:02.751
Okay.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.721
End of class!

37:34.051 --> 37:37.180
- Did you take the jumping rope too?
- What?

37:37.255 --> 37:39.952
- Give it.
- Give what?

37:40.157 --> 37:42.092
- Give it!
- It wasn't me!

37:42.159 --> 37:44.829
Stop right there!

37:44.829 --> 37:46.092
Stop there!

37:46.764 --> 37:48.460
My chips!

37:49.166 --> 37:51.635
I said stop!

37:53.170 --> 37:56.470
You're dead meat
when I catch you!

38:04.882 --> 38:08.148
I was a runner in my day!

38:14.091 --> 38:15.855
Oh, yeah?

38:49.860 --> 38:51.522
Gotcha!

38:52.096 --> 38:55.396
Thought you can
get away with this?

39:15.553 --> 39:17.988
- Handcuffs!
- Monster!

39:23.561 --> 39:28.261
Teaching your kids how to
go to jail, Mr. Handcuffs?

39:29.834 --> 39:34.329
Not yet.
It's my first day today.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.499
Whatever.

39:36.073 --> 39:37.063
This!

39:38.109 --> 39:40.169
What're you gonna
do about this?

39:42.246 --> 39:44.181
Did you really take that?

39:44.982 --> 39:48.419
Why else would this be
in her bag?

39:48.919 --> 39:50.512
Come on!

39:50.921 --> 39:54.551
That doesn't mean she stole it.

39:54.625 --> 40:01.327
And there's no evidence
it's from that corner shop.

40:01.499 --> 40:04.230
You can put your hands down.

40:04.301 --> 40:05.860
Put them down.

40:09.173 --> 40:10.266
What?

40:10.474 --> 40:14.468
You're not the only one
selling recorders.

40:14.578 --> 40:18.379
- Right?
- I saw her.

40:18.449 --> 40:21.317
How can I believe you?

40:22.119 --> 40:26.181
I heard all about you
and your temper.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.419
And that you shout and

40:28.492 --> 40:32.122
drive the kids crazy all the time.

40:32.196 --> 40:34.290
Who the hell said that?

40:34.365 --> 40:37.858
You mean who the hell
doesn't say that?

40:39.804 --> 40:42.433
What an ass!

40:42.540 --> 40:44.839
What?
Ass?

40:44.942 --> 40:47.411
What a nasty woman you are!

40:47.645 --> 40:49.204
Right, So-young?

40:49.880 --> 40:51.849
You were right, Mr. CHOI.

40:54.385 --> 40:56.081
I am special.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.752
What?

40:59.056 --> 41:00.786
A special loser.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.562
Teachers and kids don't like me

41:04.628 --> 41:06.790
cuz I never bring school supplies.

41:07.498 --> 41:09.228
That's why I steal.

41:10.768 --> 41:13.169
Mr. KANG was such a fool.

41:14.004 --> 41:16.735
He never noticed me
stealing anything.

41:17.641 --> 41:20.668
So I would steal more and more.

41:22.546 --> 41:25.072
Then a kid saw me stealing.

41:25.382 --> 41:28.682
The teacher took me
to the corner shop

41:29.753 --> 41:34.191
and Mr. KANG said that

41:34.758 --> 41:36.522
I didn't steal anything.

41:37.428 --> 41:39.624
That I was just keeping a tab.

41:41.699 --> 41:44.134
He knew everything.

41:45.069 --> 41:49.439
When and why I stole...

41:50.975 --> 41:56.243
When my dad went to jail
and my mom ran away.

41:58.649 --> 42:02.051
I was the fool.

42:04.221 --> 42:06.053
I didn't mean to steal.

42:06.590 --> 42:09.719
I wrote everything I took.

42:55.005 --> 42:58.100
What do you want?

42:58.809 --> 43:02.177
- Apologize!
- For what?

43:02.279 --> 43:05.738
He said it wasn't chicken neck,
but chicken wings!

43:05.816 --> 43:08.615
And not pigeons!

43:08.886 --> 43:09.910
Yeah?

43:10.588 --> 43:13.524
- Is that a big deal?
- Of course!

43:13.591 --> 43:16.925
Stop shouting!

43:16.994 --> 43:19.725
I'm sorry.
Okay?

43:19.830 --> 43:24.768
No! Write it on paper
and put it outside.

43:24.835 --> 43:25.768
What?

43:25.836 --> 43:31.935
Write down our corner shop
doesn't sell chicken neck!

43:34.044 --> 43:36.980
Do it now!
Write it!

43:37.982 --> 43:42.010
My dad's a good person!

43:42.886 --> 43:48.951
- Write that down!
- Write it!

43:56.533 --> 43:59.594
So your family runs the
O-sung Corner Shop?

44:01.905 --> 44:03.066
I see...

44:06.710 --> 44:09.680
- You a corn chip too?
- Sorry?

44:10.381 --> 44:14.079
- Do kids call you that too?
- Yes.

44:14.852 --> 44:16.844
Me too.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.685
He's a big chip, I'm a small chip.

44:43.647 --> 44:45.206
What's this?

44:47.418 --> 44:50.752
Underwear and socks!

45:05.836 --> 45:07.270
<i>You special?</i>

45:13.177 --> 45:15.237
You're eating alone again?

45:15.746 --> 45:17.510
I told you not to do that.

45:17.981 --> 45:21.782
You need to learn to
share with others!

45:28.759 --> 45:30.990
- Look at him!
- What?

45:31.528 --> 45:34.555
- Geez.
- Never mind him.

45:41.505 --> 45:43.303
<i>You were a loser too.</i>

45:43.507 --> 45:47.342
<i>You know how awful that feels.</i>

45:50.614 --> 45:54.073
<i>How could you call her that
in front of other kids?</i>

45:54.785 --> 45:56.413
Dumb-ass!
Idiot!

46:00.557 --> 46:05.052
<i>Is there anything you do well?</i>

46:19.009 --> 46:20.102
<i>Video game!</i>

46:32.189 --> 46:35.819
C...K...H!

46:51.408 --> 46:55.470
I have something important
to tell you.

46:55.746 --> 46:57.078
They'll take it?

46:57.314 --> 47:05.347
They're wondering why the shop
doesn't have many customers.

47:05.455 --> 47:07.515
What are they talking about?

47:07.691 --> 47:11.560
The brats come in all day.

47:11.662 --> 47:14.131
I just kicked them out that day
so it's quiet.

47:14.198 --> 47:17.566
You shouldn't have!

47:17.801 --> 47:20.771
Customers mean business!

47:20.871 --> 47:23.033
They're gonna keep
an eye on the shop

47:23.106 --> 47:26.008
and decide in a few days.

47:26.076 --> 47:30.639
Attract kids to the shop.
Let them clear the goods for you.

47:32.282 --> 47:40.486
It's made of chicken wings,
not chicken neck?

47:40.591 --> 47:43.220
Ma'am!
Ma'am!

47:43.293 --> 47:46.058
She must be sleeping.
Guys!

47:46.129 --> 47:49.930
Go to O-sung Corner Shop
down the street if you need something.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.198
Go! Go!

47:53.503 --> 47:55.233
Over there.

48:07.217 --> 48:09.550
Hey!
Get going!

48:09.620 --> 48:10.883
Why?

48:38.849 --> 48:41.876
Mr. CHOI!
Mr. CHOI!

48:43.086 --> 48:45.988
- What?
- I'm done.

48:46.823 --> 48:48.758
Good...

48:50.193 --> 48:51.661
Next.

48:52.596 --> 48:53.859
PARK So-young.

48:55.766 --> 48:57.029
Go for it.

49:34.171 --> 49:37.369
Wow!
Amazing!

49:37.474 --> 49:41.275
You're not only pretty
but also talented!

49:41.345 --> 49:42.677
Applause!

49:44.081 --> 49:46.380
So-young's amazing!

49:46.650 --> 49:48.312
Next!

49:56.159 --> 49:57.457
Damn!

50:03.400 --> 50:09.704
Why keep all this junk
no one buys?

50:23.920 --> 50:27.186
<i>I think of that kid sometimes.</i>

50:31.661 --> 50:35.223
Get lost, loser!

50:38.368 --> 50:40.269
Go, you idiot!

50:43.140 --> 50:44.938
What the heck?

50:45.042 --> 50:47.238
This is my shop!
Get lost!

50:47.310 --> 50:50.508
We paid for it!

50:50.614 --> 50:52.810
Teacher said not to eat junk food.

50:52.883 --> 50:58.379
I'm gonna report you.
SONG Jang-mi, PARK...

50:58.455 --> 51:00.447
You stinky corn chip!

51:14.071 --> 51:15.403
Want some?

51:18.842 --> 51:20.140
He's good!

51:20.610 --> 51:21.873
Let's go!

51:48.205 --> 51:49.264
Hey!

51:54.377 --> 51:57.506
You!
Happy the teacher likes you?

51:58.014 --> 52:01.451
Like playing on stolen recorder?

52:02.185 --> 52:03.949
What are you glaring at?

52:04.321 --> 52:06.950
Hey!
You!

52:07.290 --> 52:11.557
What?
Wanna punch me again?

52:11.695 --> 52:16.861
My dad said he'll send you
to jail if you do.

52:19.736 --> 52:21.568
Where you going?

52:21.872 --> 52:26.970
It'd be good to see your dad
in jail, wouldn't it?

52:27.043 --> 52:29.535
That's true!

52:30.247 --> 52:33.809
You little pig!
I'll kick your ass!

52:33.884 --> 52:38.379
- Let go!
- Stop fighting!

52:38.455 --> 52:40.014
What's going on?

52:43.026 --> 52:47.157
Fighting is part of
growing up.

52:47.631 --> 52:53.832
I know you can't be calm
and rational all the time.

52:54.638 --> 52:57.904
That wouldn't be human.

52:59.843 --> 53:05.976
So I'll forgive you
just once this time.

53:06.850 --> 53:11.811
Let's shake hands and
make peace.

53:20.597 --> 53:23.499
You guys are unbelievable!

53:23.600 --> 53:26.570
I know it's not easy,
but come on!

53:27.604 --> 53:31.063
So you're not gonna
shake hands?

53:31.308 --> 53:34.642
Then I'll make you!

53:44.955 --> 53:46.617
Put your hands in here.

53:46.957 --> 53:49.222
In here, Tae-gwon

53:49.459 --> 53:52.623
And in here, So-young.

53:53.863 --> 53:56.025
Mr. CHOI!

54:06.776 --> 54:10.679
Eat with your right hand!

54:10.747 --> 54:12.443
I'm left-handed.

54:13.016 --> 54:14.143
Damn!

54:19.322 --> 54:21.223
I'm gonna pee my pants!

54:21.291 --> 54:23.089
- No!
- Please!

54:23.159 --> 54:26.186
I'm dying here!

54:30.400 --> 54:33.837
Don't look, or I'll kick your ass.

54:38.375 --> 54:40.469
What are you doing?
Stop it!

54:42.112 --> 54:45.480
Come on!
Shoot!

54:45.649 --> 54:48.016
Tae-gwon!
Tae-gwon!

54:48.084 --> 54:51.521
- Where is Tae-gwon?
- Let's try over there.

54:52.022 --> 54:54.617
What are you doing?
No! No!

55:00.597 --> 55:01.997
Tae-gwon!

55:03.566 --> 55:06.434
I'll really kick your ass
next time!

55:12.542 --> 55:15.706
Did So-young do that
to your lips?

55:16.646 --> 55:20.481
And this and this too.

55:21.584 --> 55:22.813
Yeah?

55:22.886 --> 55:25.321
- You're lucky.
- Sorry?

55:26.056 --> 55:28.855
That you know
where you're hurt

55:29.592 --> 55:35.088
so that you can
treat and heal it.

55:38.902 --> 55:42.896
But So-young is hurt
in the heart

55:43.173 --> 55:47.634
so she can't treat it and get better.

55:49.245 --> 55:51.510
I'll scold her for
splashing water on you.

55:51.614 --> 55:57.520
No! She was just trying to help.

55:57.587 --> 56:00.250
Then you should be nice to her.

56:00.490 --> 56:04.689
Then others will think I like her.

56:04.928 --> 56:08.365
- How long have you liked her?
- Grade Two...

56:16.172 --> 56:17.231
Hi!

56:19.509 --> 56:21.740
Don't you need plastic sheets?

56:22.345 --> 56:24.109
What's that?

56:24.714 --> 56:25.704
This.

56:26.249 --> 56:29.151
One, two, three!

56:29.252 --> 56:30.584
Wow!

56:31.321 --> 56:32.186
Winner!

56:32.255 --> 56:34.747
- Gimme one more sheet!
- Here!

56:37.293 --> 56:40.752
- Try this!
- Wow!

56:41.364 --> 56:44.232
This is a top.
Coil it like this.

56:44.300 --> 56:46.428
- You're so fast!
- Outta the way!

56:48.371 --> 56:51.205
- Wow!
- So cool!

56:51.441 --> 56:52.932
I'll show you what's real cool!

56:53.009 --> 56:55.171
- Wow!
- That's so cool!

56:58.047 --> 57:01.677
Like this, you can win
the eraser battle.

57:01.785 --> 57:03.344
Wow!

57:03.653 --> 57:06.885
Sis! Teach us jumping rope!

57:06.956 --> 57:08.788
One, two, three!

57:16.499 --> 57:17.899
You're out!

57:18.001 --> 57:20.630
- I'm not out!
- Yes you are!

57:24.808 --> 57:27.334
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:27.410 --> 57:30.244
- So what should we do?
- Attract customers!

57:30.313 --> 57:31.440
Right!

57:31.514 --> 57:33.915
Then I can sell
all this stuff sooner

57:33.983 --> 57:36.976
and get rid of this shop, too!

57:38.021 --> 57:39.512
Think about it.

57:40.056 --> 57:44.187
Where would these kids go
if Mi-na's Corner Shop closed?

57:44.828 --> 57:47.423
- To our shop!
- Right!

57:47.664 --> 57:51.260
So you have to help me
sell the shop.

57:51.468 --> 57:52.834
- Got it?
- Yes.

57:52.969 --> 57:53.698
Okay!

57:55.271 --> 57:59.766
Cheers to us,
corn chips!

58:00.844 --> 58:07.444
This goes to O-sung Corner Shop!
May it prosper!

58:07.517 --> 58:08.883
Prosper!

58:11.855 --> 58:14.689
Let's play, So-young!

58:22.131 --> 58:23.793
- So-young.
- Yes?

58:24.367 --> 58:29.999
I was actually a loner.

58:30.974 --> 58:36.038
So to get back at other kids,
I rang their bells and ran away.

58:37.280 --> 58:40.307
That was so fun and exciting
at the time.

58:41.084 --> 58:45.647
But some time later,
I started to wonder

58:45.788 --> 58:48.587
why I always ran away.

58:48.992 --> 58:56.729
Why couldn't I just face up to
whoever opened the door?

58:58.268 --> 59:05.698
It's not cuz I was a bad fighter
or my mom was a cafe lady.

59:07.610 --> 59:14.449
I was a loner cuz I always ran away
before others approached me.

59:15.952 --> 59:20.913
I wonder what happened
to that girl

59:21.190 --> 59:23.455
I used to hang out with.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.368
Rock, paper, scissors!

59:35.438 --> 59:41.400
Take it easy, guys!

59:41.511 --> 59:45.312
- Two drinks, sis!
- Here.

59:46.983 --> 59:48.576
Where are you going?

59:48.751 --> 59:51.778
- I'm hungry.
- Oh yeah?

59:52.221 --> 59:54.053
- Want some noodles?
- Really?

59:54.123 --> 59:56.991
Of course!
Just continue the game.

59:57.060 --> 59:59.791
- Me too!
- I want some too!

59:59.896 --> 01:00:00.920
All of you?

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:02.929
- Ta-da!
- Yay!

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:09.202
- Guys!
- Huh?

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:11.505
A dollar, please.

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:18.774
LET'S COMPLIMENT!

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:25.817
As a way of building up friendship
between classmates

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:28.722
let's say good things
about each other.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:33.354
Say something good about
your classmate standing at the front.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:37.594
Like he or she is pretty,
kind, or whatever.

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:39.727
- Easy, right?
- Yes.

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:44.904
First up is Tae-gwon.
What's good about him?

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:47.534
- He buys me snacks.
- Oh!

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.210
He gives you $20 discount at
Taekwondo School.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.411
- Wow, can I get a discount too?
- Sure!

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.290
Good!
Next!

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:03.218
What's good about Min-hee?

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:07.195
Her dad makes a lot of money
so he buys us fried chicken.

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:12.268
She's pretty and warm-hearted.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:15.931
Jong-ho!
You like Min-hee, huh?

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.675
Embarrass him, everyone!

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:24.712
Next is So-young.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:35.083
Let's list what's good
about So-young.

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:43.461
Nothing?

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:47.603
How about we list
what's bad about her?

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:05.448
Jin-hee cleans the blackboard
every recess

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:12.351
and Ji-hye's good at tying hair.

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:18.794
Jong-ho found Ha-young's bag
the other day.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:27.636
Joo-eun lends out her pencils,
erasers and sketchbooks

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:33.908
and Ji-min helps her partner
with studying.

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:40.783
Min-hee has a younger
sister who's sick.

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:45.322
So she takes her to school
and home every lunch.

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:53.529
Joo-young helps his mother
at the market after school.

01:02:55.571 --> 01:02:58.598
I see him when I go to
my grandma's store.

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:09.051
Tae-gwon's always the first one
organizing the gym equipment.

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:18.126
Use Hadoken!
Block him!

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:21.255
Do Shoryuken or Hurricane Kick!

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:24.596
Hadoken!
You're out!

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:29.263
Try harder, guys.
Go home now.

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:32.068
Bye!

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:50.058
Buy three and get one free!

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:53.792

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:08.716

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:22.100
Where's that?

- Follow me.
- Come.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:34.114
I have to take folders
to school tomorrow.

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:37.009
What kind do you want?

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.849
Is it for your notices?

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:40.183
30 cents, please!

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:43.686
It's under promotion.
You get two more.

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:53.602
Let go!

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:55.831
You lost!
You owe me 10 cents!

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:58.031
You tricked me!
Loser!

01:07:58.107 --> 01:08:00.008
Stop this!

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:04.046
What's wrong?

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.115
What's going on here?

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:11.312
What?
What did I do?

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.182
Look.

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:16.415
Are you running
some gambling house?

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:18.260
This isn't a corner shop.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:20.194
And also...

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.531
Hey!

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:27.694
Just a sec.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:30.870
Look at this junk
food you're selling!

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:32.407
Junk food?

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:35.171
It's all approved
by the government!

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:36.510
Here.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:39.080
So that makes it okay?

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:42.345
Kids got that
and rat poison confused.

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:44.920
It was on the news last year.

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:50.585
You know,
a lot of rats died too!

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:57.465
You're a complete lunatic,
woman!

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:01.836
Who the hell are you
calling a lunatic?

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:04.634
You're a crazy monster!

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.441
- Don't start, sis!
- You want your ass kicked?

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:09.707
You're pathetic!

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:10.939
I'll kick your ass!

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:12.742
How dare you!
I'm a teacher here!

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:15.044
Mi-na!

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.850
We got the deal!

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.388
They want the shop!

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:28.129
Good job, Mi-na!
It's over, now!

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:31.098
They'll be here soon.

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:35.096
Corn chip?

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.439
Look what we got!
Kang-ho's here too!

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:44.246
This kind man's
a teacher here.

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:46.544
What are you doing here?

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:50.283
Loser?

01:09:53.488 --> 01:09:57.688
You know each other?

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:03.331
Mi-na!
Mi-na!

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:06.665
You write so well!

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:10.371
What are you waiting for?
Sign the contract!

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:11.868
Oh.

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:17.880
So you were keeping the kids
out on purpose?

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:20.505
Just that day,
so that it's quiet.

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:23.142
We're gonna get rid
of that bench outside.

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:27.713
It looks bad having little brats
slacking around there.

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:32.025
What are the kids like here?

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:36.925
They're kind.
Innocent and pure-minded.

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:39.468
We mean their status.

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:42.369
Low class kids
tend to steal a lot.

01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:45.339
And they usually
look for cheap things.

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:46.739
Look.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.211
Yes?

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:55.574
Can I get the deposit this week?

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:58.382
I need it for something.

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:01.647
We have the money set aside.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.556
That's not a problem.

01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:05.287
Good, then!

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.592
We just need your seals.

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:09.894
Here and here.

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:30.048
<i>If I were a bird,
I would fly far away.</i>

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:33.380
<i>Into the distance...</i>

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.372
Why are you alone?

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:54.437
Where's your best friend?

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:04.621
His mom won't let him be my friend
cuz I failed the Chinese test.

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:08.952
You're pretty good.

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.383
Do you study art?

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:17.825
No, cuz I'm too busy with
other after-school academies.

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:20.468
Why do you go to
so many academies?

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.494
Your family must be rich.

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:25.468
No, I just have a lot of siblings.

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:31.039
My mom doesn't want me
in the house cuz she's tired.

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:34.911
All done.

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:41.286
Look!
See your picture?

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:44.154
Do you see what's in it?

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:51.198
There are Chinese characters
in your picture.

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:54.430
Here's the character
for 'mountain'.

01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:56.364
Wow!

01:12:56.739 --> 01:13:01.109
Here's the character for 'wood'.
Right?

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:05.581
And the character 'field'.

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:21.788
- I'm here, sis!
- Me too!

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:26.767
- Did you pass the Chinese test?
- No.

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:30.204
What are you waiting for?

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:31.705
Join us!

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:36.675
You're all done!
Now, then...

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:41.147
- What's this?
- Moustache!

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.443
My dad has moustache too!

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:46.317
It's so prickly!

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:50.655
That's right!
We don't like dad's moustache!

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.863
Cuz it's so prickly!

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:57.023
- This is the character for 'father'!
- Father!

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.157
Try it!

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:05.264
We don't like dad's moustache!

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:07.575
Are you feverish?

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:10.946
No, just hot.

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:15.517
It's getting hot.

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:19.813
But this shirt absorbs all the sweat.
It's expensive cotton.

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:22.583
Still keep your shirt on.
Or you'll get a cold.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.388
Okay.

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:27.195
By the way.

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:31.489
- Don't I smell good?
- Sorry?

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:33.793
Don't you get it?

01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:36.838
His daughter bought him
underwear and lotion.

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:38.134
Oh.

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:42.908
And also shampoo, soap,
toothpaste and shaver.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:47.416
- And these socks!
- You must be so happy.

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:53.521
Corn chip!

01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:04.567
I was just taking a walk.
I need to get some change.

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.225
Why here?

01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:10.466
I was sure I won the video game

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:13.132
but someone keeps
on topping me.

01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:16.809
So I wanna find him
and beat him for good.

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.711
It's good to see you.

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.516
KBG?

01:15:46.508 --> 01:15:47.942
KBG!

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:53.278
KANG Bong-geun!
Your father's got good name.

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:56.450
You're so good!

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:59.382
Like father like daughter!

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:04.253
Your dad always bragged about
how good he is at video games.

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:06.087
I hated him for that.

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:12.200
When he got this machine,
I told him

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:15.536
I want my name as the best player.

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:18.538
So that other kids
don't look down on me.

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:23.205
But he put his name
as the best player.

01:16:23.378 --> 01:16:26.610
He's so childish,
wanting to beat kids.

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:33.447
He probably just wanted to
play with them.

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:35.684
He liked kids.

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:39.317
Yeah, except for me.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.435
Come on!
You're his daughter.

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:55.633
He always asked other kids
to be nice to you.

01:16:55.811 --> 01:17:00.146
Then gave them extra papers,
let them play video games

01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:02.816
or taught them to ride the bike.

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:07.855
That's probably why
kids made fun of you more.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:11.358
So that Mr. KANG
would be nicer to them.

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:28.077
Like this?

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.270
Let's put this.

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:34.212
King Taejong, Sejong...

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.678
Who was the next king?

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:42.617
- Injong.
- Oh, yeah!

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:44.419
Injong!

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:49.160
Which team are you gonna cheer for
on the sports day?

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:52.098
She said she's on white team.

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:53.533
- Right?
- No, blue team!

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:57.431
I'm on the winning team.
So win.

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:59.303
10 note books for winning team.

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:01.206
- Really?
- Ten note books?

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:04.403
- Delivery, miss!
- No thanks.

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:05.979
I'm not buying any more.

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:09.780
Come on, miss.
Take my business card.

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:12.445
I'm the new sales director
at Joeun Company.

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:13.886
I said no thanks!

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:18.158
You should put some
lotion on your face.

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:20.524
Have you seen the ex sales director?

01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:23.955
He seemed like such a gentleman

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:28.493
but he apparently beat up his kids

01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:31.664
cuz they ate junk food.

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:36.344
You skipped the academy today,
didn't you?

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:39.542
What did I say I'd do
if you skipped academy?

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:41.105
You even failed
your test last time!

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:42.947
What's going on?

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:45.384
None of your business.
I'm his mother.

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:46.580
Really?

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:50.218
Then why are you so clueless
about your child?

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:51.190
What?

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:53.057
You know what
your son tells me?

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:56.495
Don't have any children.

01:18:56.598 --> 01:19:00.365
That his mom hates him
cuz she's so tired of kids.

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:03.030
How can you blame him?

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:07.136
Are you really concerned
about our kids?

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:10.839
You make them play video games
and feed them junk food.

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:14.349
It's not junk food, ma'am!

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:16.350
It's all approved
by the government!

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:17.817
Whatever, mister!

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:20.946
You're just after money!

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:24.424
Are you happy making
money off kids?

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:28.793
No need for further words.
We need to get rid of this bench.

01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:33.700
I never liked this place ever since
that man run the shop.

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:37.306
- No!
- No!

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:40.999
Stop it!

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:50.282
The shop's closing down
this week anyway.

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:51.785
So quit all this.

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:59.924
What you staring at?

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:02.296
What did I tell you?

01:20:02.664 --> 01:20:04.292
I told you not to come here.

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:07.100
This isn't your playground.

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:14.209
Get lost!
Go home, people!

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:18.010
- Don't close the shop!
- Don't close it!

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:24.777
- Please!
- Please don't close it!

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:28.150
- Don't close it!
- Sis!

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:58.279
Let's drink.

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:01.588
This is worse than alcohol.

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:11.895
So good!

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:16.865
This is it!
The taste of home.

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:19.899
More like taste of junk food.

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:24.377
This is not junk food.

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.740
It's our best friend.

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:32.617
It's the memory of
a certain time we lived.

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:37.552
For me, it's a taste of
bad memory.

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:42.657
Then coffee is a taste of
bad memory for me.

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:48.332
So is milk, herbal tea,
and egg yolk.

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:52.373
For So-young, rice would be
taste of bad memory

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.432
cuz her grandma sells it.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.509
So good!

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:03.582
Really?
So-young's so cool.

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.415
Kids must've been touched!

01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:12.556
But the problem is now that
So-young's opening up

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:15.128
kids are backing out.

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:17.659
It's cuz they're ashamed.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:19.990
Oh yeah!

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:22.800
Put her in the relay
this sports day.

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:24.304
She's fast.

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:25.763
Relay?

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:31.843
Don't you remember?

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:35.514
How I became popular
cuz I won a losing relay?

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:41.986
- And what if she loses?
- Make sure she doesn't!

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:46.284
Bribe the other team
with toys beforehand.

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:48.458
Like your dad did?

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:52.329
He did that so that
you can win.

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:56.399
Mr. KANG had a hard
time cuz the kid

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:59.770
in the other team told everyone.

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:03.806
I guess you didn't know
cuz you moved to Seoul.

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:10.616
I wondered why that kid
suddenly fell down.

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:12.512
What?

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:20.659
So he cheated on you
with another woman?

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:24.666
No, he cheated on her with me.

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:28.159
What an asshole!

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:30.568
Let's listen to music, Kang-ho!

01:23:30.705 --> 01:23:37.134
You'll never believe what I found.

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:43.517
Turn that off.

01:23:44.953 --> 01:23:48.583
What the heck is that?

01:23:49.657 --> 01:23:57.963
Stop it already.

01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:03.897
- Come on!
<i>- It's all a memory</i>

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:09.968
<i>The love I recollect
now and then.</i>

01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:11.239
Don't you remember?

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.813
Whatever!

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:16.716
<i>I long to see you again</i>

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:20.687
<i>only if by chance</i>

01:24:20.989 --> 01:24:25.017
My very first love!

01:24:25.126 --> 01:24:26.788
Loser!

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:36.300
<i>Your smile is unforgettable
although it wasn't very pretty</i>

01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:40.169
<i>Your back turned against me</i>

01:24:40.241 --> 01:24:42.938
Don't let go, okay?

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:44.239
Okay!

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:46.973
Run!

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:01.055
JANG-MI IS STUPID

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:03.930
BUTT HOLE

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:09.826
<i>But it's the name of my love</i>

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:12.464
Hold it like this.

01:25:14.008 --> 01:25:21.211
<i>I long to see you again
only if by chance</i>

01:25:21.316 --> 01:25:26.550
<i>My very first love.</i>

01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:34.654
Cheers!

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:52.609
I'm outta here...

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:17.698
TRIUMPHAL ARCH

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:42.493
TRIUMPHAL ARCH

01:26:44.098 --> 01:26:48.229
- Way to go, blue team!
- Way to go, white team!

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:52.535
- Way to go, blue team!
- Way to go, white team!

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:03.949
Run, Mi-na, run!
That's my girl!

01:27:04.953 --> 01:27:08.048
Good, Mi-na!
Run!

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:10.286
Yay!

01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:14.955
Hooray!
Hooray!

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:18.166
FIRST PRIZE WINNER

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:21.659
I won the race.
So don't look down me anymore.

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:23.466
Okay, okay.

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:26.835
Why weren't you
wearing your shoes?

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:28.171
Cuz they're ugly.

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:03.969
Hello?
Miss?

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:06.175
Everything's loaded up.

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:08.711
Is this for the school, too?

01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:12.618
It looked personal.

01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:16.348
AWARD

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:21.955
HOW TO MAKE EGG ROLLS

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:25.384
HOW TO TIE HAIR

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:28.122
Ouch!
You suck!

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.597
You don't even know
how to tie hair!

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:34.465
You should braid your hair
when you're running.

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:40.331
so that it doesn't get
in your way.

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:42.607
All done.

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:47.713
FOR SPORTS DAY

01:29:57.425 --> 01:30:01.328
<i>Look, Mi-na.
Your favorite 24 color crayons!</i>

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:05.623
<i>And Lala and Mimi paper dolls!
I saved them for you!</i>

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:09.302
<i>I hate you the most, dad!</i>

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:13.239
<i>Because of you,
kids call me corn chip!</i>

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:22.521
<i>Am I handsome?
Where are you?</i>

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:27.691
<i>I'm the leader of the white team.
10 note books if we win, right?</i>

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:30.101
<i>Three noodles later, sis!</i>

01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:33.269
<i>Corn chip sis!
We miss you!</i>

01:33:33.674 --> 01:33:37.133
<i>Can you work part-time
at our corner shop?</i>

01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:51.016
<i>The train for Seoul is
now approaching.</i>

01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:55.127
<i>Please be careful when you
board the train.</i>

01:34:03.504 --> 01:34:05.973
<i>Where are you, corn chip?</i>

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.475
<i>Say hello, guys!</i>

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:12.636
<i>Say something to Mi-na.</i>

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:14.579
<i>Start with you, So-young!</i>

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:18.409
<i>I'm sorry, Mi-na.</i>

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:23.789
<i>Like I promised Mr. KANG,
I'll pay you back when I get a job.</i>

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:26.826
<i>And the other thing
you wanted to say.</i>

01:34:27.395 --> 01:34:31.162
<i>And I think I can win the race</i>

01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:32.756
<i>if you come and cheer for me!</i>

01:34:43.377 --> 01:34:44.401
Excuse me?

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:48.041
Ready!

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:03.859
Hurry!

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:55.543
So-young!

01:36:09.864 --> 01:36:13.198
That's my girl!

01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:16.862
You're doing great!
Run, baby, run!

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:36.887
Mi-na!
Daddy's here!

01:36:36.957 --> 01:36:41.156
Daddy's cheering for you!

01:37:13.294 --> 01:37:14.887
So-young!

01:38:24.598 --> 01:38:26.464
We won!

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.733
- Corn chip sis!
- Hi sis!

01:39:02.002 --> 01:39:03.630
We won!

01:39:03.837 --> 01:39:06.068
I passed the Chinese test!

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.200
I won the skipping rope contest!

01:39:08.275 --> 01:39:11.439
Wanna see me play the drum?

01:39:11.512 --> 01:39:13.674
Did you see me?
I was so good!

01:39:22.056 --> 01:39:25.288
- One copy, please.
- Sure.

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:41.800
Here you go.

01:39:41.909 --> 01:39:43.275
- Thank you.
- Bye.

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:52.184
I hate going to the
bank to get change.

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:53.450
Sorry?

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.352
And the bank's so far from here.

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:58.324
Three blocks away!

01:39:58.459 --> 01:39:59.324
So?

01:39:59.426 --> 01:40:03.761
So if you keep on
taking our coins

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:06.357
we have to keep
on going to the bank!

01:40:06.633 --> 01:40:08.693
You work here?

01:40:09.303 --> 01:40:13.001
Do I look like some low-life scum
who takes change?

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:17.107
I'm 42 this year.

01:40:17.244 --> 01:40:21.306
This country has lost
the democratic spirit!

01:40:21.415 --> 01:40:25.614
I have never felt so indignified,
even when I was a student activist!

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:29.020
If you were an activist,
you shouldn't be doing that!

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:30.614
- What?
- This!

01:40:30.724 --> 01:40:31.714
What's this?

01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:37.726
This is my money!
It's my own change.

01:40:37.798 --> 01:40:39.357
Then show me.

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:43.801
Show you?
Fine!

01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:46.270
Look!

01:40:46.473 --> 01:40:47.532
GOVERNMENT MONEY

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:58.515
KANG Mi-na!

01:41:00.487 --> 01:41:04.288
Your resignation's
been accepted.

01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:07.686
How dare you toss
a government position?

01:41:08.028 --> 01:41:10.156
Don't you be calling me
to your wedding.

01:41:10.497 --> 01:41:13.695
If you get married,
get out of the province.

01:41:15.436 --> 01:41:16.768
Get outta here, kiddo!

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:29.548
Are you here for good, then?

01:41:29.616 --> 01:41:33.246
You nuts?
Running a junk corner shop?

01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:34.683
It's just part-time.

01:41:37.057 --> 01:41:39.253
How much are
the steamed buns?

01:41:39.326 --> 01:41:40.227
50 cents!

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:42.355
Isn't this on sale?

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:48.666
What does it say here?
It's three dollars!
