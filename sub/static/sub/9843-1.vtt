02:33.082 --> 02:35.082
Uther!

02:35.126 --> 02:37.754
Merlin!

02:38.087 --> 02:40.840
Merlin, I am the strongest.

02:41.090 --> 02:43.843
I am the one.

02:56.689 --> 02:59.400
The sword! You promised me the sword!

02:59.650 --> 03:04.489
And you shall have it,
but to heal, not to hack.

03:04.739 --> 03:05.807
Tomorrow...

03:05.907 --> 03:08.217
...a truce. We meet at the river.

03:08.242 --> 03:11.329
Talk! Talk is for lovers, Merlin.

03:11.579 --> 03:15.541
I need a sword to be king.

03:50.451 --> 03:53.287
Show the sword.

03:58.626 --> 04:02.922
Behold the sword of power.

04:03.172 --> 04:05.842
Excalibur.

04:08.469 --> 04:11.055
Forged when the world was young...

04:11.305 --> 04:13.416
...and bird, and beast, and flower...

04:13.516 --> 04:15.084
...were one with man...

04:15.184 --> 04:19.480
...and death was but a dream.

04:19.981 --> 04:22.608
Speak the words.

04:22.859 --> 04:24.859
One land, one king!

04:24.986 --> 04:28.781
That is my peace, Cornwall.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.955
Lord Uther,
if I yield to the sword of power...

04:36.205 --> 04:37.482
...what will you yield?

04:37.582 --> 04:39.067
Me, yield?

04:39.167 --> 04:42.795
He has given. Now you must.

04:44.630 --> 04:47.920
The land from here to the sea shall be yours...

04:47.925 --> 04:51.971
...if you enforce the King's will.

04:55.141 --> 04:57.685
Done!

04:58.353 --> 04:59.754
Good.

04:59.854 --> 05:04.650
King Uther, let's feast together.
To my castle.

05:10.990 --> 05:14.535
My wife will dance for us.

05:14.786 --> 05:18.623
Igrayne, dance!

05:26.547 --> 05:28.883
You may be king, Uther...

05:29.133 --> 05:33.721
...but no queen of yours could ever match her.

06:35.616 --> 06:36.684
I must have her.

06:36.784 --> 06:40.413
Are you mad? The alliance.

06:49.297 --> 06:51.115
I must have her.

06:51.215 --> 06:54.802
And risk everything you've won?

07:16.324 --> 07:19.285
King Uther.

07:45.895 --> 07:48.189
You'll never batter this down...

07:48.439 --> 07:52.360
...and you'll never have Igrayne!

07:52.402 --> 07:56.072
Merlin! Where are you?

07:56.114 --> 08:00.159
- Have you found him?
- I haven't.

08:01.119 --> 08:03.371
He's here, all right.

08:03.621 --> 08:07.000
He won't show himself.

08:11.129 --> 08:13.256
Where have you been?

08:13.506 --> 08:15.909
I have walked my way
since the beginning of time.

08:16.009 --> 08:17.911
Sometimes I give, sometimes I take.

08:18.011 --> 08:19.913
It is mine to know which and when.

08:20.013 --> 08:21.956
- You must help me, Merlin!
- Must I?

08:22.056 --> 08:23.625
I am your king.

08:23.725 --> 08:27.395
So you need me again,
now that my truce is wrecked.

08:27.645 --> 08:31.285
Years to build and moments to ruin,
and all for lust.

08:31.315 --> 08:33.650
For Igrayne.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.696
One night with her.

08:36.946 --> 08:39.474
You don't understand. You're not a man.

08:39.573 --> 08:43.453
Use the magic! Do it!

08:46.331 --> 08:49.375
Igrayne.

08:51.502 --> 08:54.881
You will swear by your true kingship...

08:55.131 --> 08:58.092
...to grant me what I wish.

08:58.343 --> 09:00.511
Then you shall have it.

09:00.762 --> 09:02.930
By Excalibur, I swear it.

09:03.181 --> 09:07.643
What issues from your lust shall be mine.

09:07.894 --> 09:09.003
Swear it again.

09:09.103 --> 09:12.190
I swear it!

09:20.657 --> 09:22.784
They have given up. It's over.

09:23.034 --> 09:24.602
Not quite.

09:24.702 --> 09:29.290
When night falls,
we'll follow them and finish them.

10:46.492 --> 10:48.186
I dreamt of the Dragon.

10:48.286 --> 10:50.997
I have awoken him.

10:51.247 --> 10:56.377
Can't you see, all around you,
the Dragon's breath?

11:14.854 --> 11:17.774
We have drawn him out.

11:18.024 --> 11:22.153
The Duke is off to pursue your men.

11:24.405 --> 11:26.658
There he goes.

11:26.908 --> 11:28.434
Good.

11:28.534 --> 11:31.037
Mount your horse.

11:31.287 --> 11:35.041
I will transform you
into the semblance of the Duke.

11:35.291 --> 11:40.004
Igrayne will think her husband has returned.

11:40.296 --> 11:42.632
But the cliff, the sea?

11:42.882 --> 11:45.009
Your lust will hold you up.

11:45.259 --> 11:48.304
You will float on the Dragon's breath.

11:48.554 --> 11:51.140
Ride!

11:51.557 --> 11:54.394
Ride!

12:13.496 --> 12:17.542
Take on the outer shape of the Duke.

12:18.167 --> 12:19.986
Change!

12:20.086 --> 12:22.255
Transform!

12:22.505 --> 12:25.466
Now!

12:35.435 --> 12:37.770
That's it.

12:38.021 --> 12:40.648
That's it.

12:47.321 --> 12:48.890
It's the Duke.

12:48.990 --> 12:52.785
The Duke has returned. Open the gates.

12:53.036 --> 12:57.790
Have the horse ready.
I ride out before sunrise.

13:05.506 --> 13:07.506
Uther!

13:07.508 --> 13:10.887
Find the King. Find Uther.

13:16.225 --> 13:19.020
Uther, come out and fight.

13:19.270 --> 13:23.858
We're under attack. It's Cornwall.

13:31.658 --> 13:34.869
My father is dead.

13:44.045 --> 13:47.632
Hush, Morgana, hush.

13:53.888 --> 13:58.476
My father, my father is dead.

14:01.979 --> 14:03.006
Look.

14:03.106 --> 14:05.106
Here's your father.

14:05.108 --> 14:08.736
It was just a dream, little one.

14:08.945 --> 14:11.739
Come, Igrayne.

14:12.615 --> 14:15.451
Go to sleep.

14:24.877 --> 14:27.463
My lord.

15:26.356 --> 15:29.942
The future has taken root in the present.

15:30.193 --> 15:32.904
It is done.

15:42.914 --> 15:44.315
When? Where?

15:44.415 --> 15:46.655
In the camp of Uther, my lady...

15:46.876 --> 15:49.545
...just after nightfall.

15:49.796 --> 15:51.614
It can't be.

15:51.714 --> 15:53.283
He came to me...

15:53.383 --> 15:55.968
...to his bed, last night.

15:56.219 --> 15:58.721
What shall become of us?

15:58.971 --> 16:01.349
Lord Uther, my lady.

16:01.599 --> 16:04.936
It will be for him to say.

16:06.312 --> 16:09.273
Oh, Morgana.

16:18.408 --> 16:20.143
The King. The King.

16:20.243 --> 16:22.829
Wait!

16:28.918 --> 16:30.320
Out!

16:30.420 --> 16:33.339
- What is it, lady?
- A boy, sir.

16:33.589 --> 16:35.491
- Send the girl away.
- She's only a child.

16:35.591 --> 16:38.636
- Out!
- Go, Morgana.

16:39.929 --> 16:43.850
She watches me with her father's eyes.

16:46.060 --> 16:50.314
Is it mine or his?

16:50.940 --> 16:53.067
A man came to me...

16:53.317 --> 16:56.320
...and loved me...

16:57.572 --> 17:00.825
...and made this child.

17:01.868 --> 17:04.537
I thought it was my husband...

17:04.787 --> 17:08.165
...but he was already dead.

17:19.093 --> 17:22.847
All I know is how to butcher men.

17:22.972 --> 17:27.018
From now on, I shall learn to love them.

17:27.352 --> 17:30.688
I am weary of battle.

17:33.149 --> 17:36.527
I shall stay by his side...

17:37.195 --> 17:40.281
...and his mother's.

17:42.992 --> 17:45.703
He's hungry.

17:57.632 --> 18:00.502
Merlin, you come when you're not asked...

18:00.635 --> 18:02.412
...and pay no heed when I call you.

18:02.512 --> 18:06.683
Oh, I have slept for nine moons.

18:06.933 --> 18:10.478
What I did for you wasn't easy.

18:10.645 --> 18:13.690
Now you must pay me.

18:13.731 --> 18:17.193
The child is mine.

18:17.402 --> 18:20.363
You made an oath.

18:20.947 --> 18:23.533
They were hasty words, Merlin.

18:23.783 --> 18:27.036
This is flesh and blood.

18:27.328 --> 18:29.539
Uther, is this true?

18:29.789 --> 18:31.819
Don't let him take the child.

18:31.833 --> 18:33.833
I swore an oath, Igrayne.

18:33.876 --> 18:37.213
I made a pact with Merlin.

18:38.798 --> 18:40.967
It was you!

18:41.217 --> 18:43.636
You came to me that night.

18:43.886 --> 18:45.886
You are the father!

18:46.055 --> 18:48.224
It's not for you, Uther...

18:48.474 --> 18:52.729
...hearth and home, wife and child.

18:55.732 --> 18:58.609
To kill and be king, is that all?

18:58.860 --> 19:02.030
Perhaps not even that.

19:02.196 --> 19:04.949
You strike me with words hard as steel.

19:05.199 --> 19:07.810
You betrayed the Duke, you stole his wife...

19:07.910 --> 19:12.457
...you took his castle,
now no one trusts you.

19:12.498 --> 19:15.376
You're not the one, Uther.

19:15.626 --> 19:18.004
Give me the child.

19:18.254 --> 19:21.299
I will protect him.

19:28.014 --> 19:30.014
No!

19:30.224 --> 19:33.102
Why?

19:33.394 --> 19:35.394
Take him.

19:35.396 --> 19:38.024
Take the devil child.

19:38.274 --> 19:40.009
No!

19:40.109 --> 19:43.154
Why the baby?

19:44.781 --> 19:49.494
No! Go after him!

19:49.702 --> 19:51.702
That's it.

19:51.913 --> 19:53.273
Sleep now.

19:53.373 --> 19:55.375
Go after him!

19:55.625 --> 19:57.402
Get him back!

19:57.502 --> 20:02.507
Are you the mother and father
of the baby now, Merlin?

20:19.440 --> 20:22.652
Where are you?

20:26.531 --> 20:29.826
I want my son.

20:32.996 --> 20:35.581
Attack!

20:36.749 --> 20:38.067
Ambush!

20:38.167 --> 20:41.546
Help me, Ulfius.

20:48.803 --> 20:50.747
The King's bodyguard! Look out!

20:50.847 --> 20:54.434
The King! The King is ambushed!

21:13.036 --> 21:15.663
Excalibur.

21:39.937 --> 21:41.256
The sword!

21:41.356 --> 21:44.317
The King's sword.

21:55.912 --> 21:59.999
Merlin, where are you?

22:00.458 --> 22:02.458
Call your Dragon...

22:02.627 --> 22:05.004
...to weave a mist...

22:05.254 --> 22:07.799
...to hide us.

22:08.049 --> 22:12.136
Merlin, where are you?

22:13.763 --> 22:17.225
Nobody shall have the sword.

22:18.601 --> 22:21.312
Nobody shall wield Excalibur...

22:21.562 --> 22:24.232
...but me.

22:40.623 --> 22:43.209
Uther!

22:43.292 --> 22:48.840
He who draws the sword from the stone,
he shall be king.

22:51.217 --> 22:52.827
Arthur...

22:52.927 --> 22:55.930
...you're the one.

23:37.513 --> 23:39.582
Now remember, my sons,
what I've told you.

23:39.682 --> 23:42.043
Pay no heed to these robber knights.

23:42.143 --> 23:45.605
You, Kay, be brave and honest and merciful...

23:45.855 --> 23:47.423
...as a knight should be.

23:47.523 --> 23:51.277
And you, Arthur, be modest and true...

23:51.527 --> 23:56.407
...and help your brother
to uphold the good name of Morven.

24:29.232 --> 24:31.232
I remember my first joust.

24:31.275 --> 24:35.321
It looks far worse than it feels.

24:47.291 --> 24:51.796
Camelyarde! Camelyarde!

25:04.142 --> 25:06.936
God, send us a true king.

25:07.186 --> 25:08.671
We are unworthy...

25:08.771 --> 25:11.711
...but the land bleeds, the people suffer.

25:11.941 --> 25:14.861
We have sinned, but on this Easter Day...

25:15.111 --> 25:18.097
...when Christ rose from the dead,
may one knight here...

25:18.197 --> 25:21.284
...through victory in arms find the grace...

25:21.534 --> 25:26.539
...to draw the sword and be king.

25:27.332 --> 25:30.710
By my right of victory...

25:30.960 --> 25:33.921
...by my blood...

25:34.797 --> 25:37.884
...give me the power.

26:10.792 --> 26:14.379
All knights prepare and be ready...

26:14.629 --> 26:18.269
...who would joust for the right
to draw the sword...

26:18.466 --> 26:21.761
...from the stone.

26:23.388 --> 26:27.850
Arthur, where is Kay's sword?

26:33.147 --> 26:36.734
A good squire doesn't forget
his knight's sword.

26:36.984 --> 26:38.428
I left it in the tent, Father.

26:38.528 --> 26:41.989
Well hurry then, and get it.

26:51.666 --> 26:54.419
Stolen!

27:18.568 --> 27:20.053
I'll see what's keeping him.

27:20.153 --> 27:24.073
Well hurry, you'll miss your chance.

27:51.434 --> 27:55.688
Your sword was stolen,
but here is Excalibur.

27:57.231 --> 27:58.675
Kay?

27:58.775 --> 28:02.111
Did you free Excalibur from the stone?

28:02.362 --> 28:04.097
Yes.

28:04.197 --> 28:06.908
No, I didn't. Arthur did.

28:07.158 --> 28:09.661
The sword! The sword!

28:09.911 --> 28:11.437
You freed it, Arthur?

28:11.537 --> 28:15.458
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.

28:17.210 --> 28:20.296
You must put it back.

28:31.182 --> 28:34.811
Now try to draw it again, Arthur.

28:35.061 --> 28:38.398
Wait! I, Uryens, will try.

28:38.648 --> 28:41.651
Stand back.

28:48.783 --> 28:51.995
Let the boy try.

28:52.412 --> 28:55.832
Let the boy try.

28:58.626 --> 29:02.839
Come on, Arthur. Don't be afraid.

29:10.138 --> 29:15.268
We have our king! Thanks be to God!

29:21.315 --> 29:22.759
Rise, Father, please.

29:22.859 --> 29:25.553
I was your son before I became your king...

29:25.653 --> 29:26.721
...if I am king.

29:26.821 --> 29:28.865
You are king...

29:29.115 --> 29:33.244
...the more so,
because you are not my son...

29:33.494 --> 29:35.494
...and I am not your father.

29:35.663 --> 29:37.273
Not my father?

29:37.373 --> 29:39.959
Then Kay is not my brother?

29:40.209 --> 29:44.322
Merlin the magician brought you to me
when you were newly born...

29:44.422 --> 29:47.884
...and bade me raise you as my own.

29:48.134 --> 29:51.914
At first I did so because I feared Merlin,
but later...

29:52.138 --> 29:53.915
...because I loved you.

29:54.015 --> 29:56.015
Who is my true father?

29:56.059 --> 29:58.159
Only Merlin can tell you that.

29:58.186 --> 29:59.837
And who is Merlin?

29:59.937 --> 30:03.775
I am Merlin.

30:04.025 --> 30:06.361
Whose son am I?

30:06.611 --> 30:11.282
You are the son of Uther and Igrayne...

30:11.532 --> 30:14.744
...you are King Arthur.

30:14.786 --> 30:19.123
We haven't forgotten you.
What trickery is this?

30:21.668 --> 30:24.888
He's trying to foist a fatherless boy upon us.

30:25.046 --> 30:27.465
Do you want a bastard as a king?

30:27.715 --> 30:30.034
Lord Leondegrance, join us against the boy.

30:30.134 --> 30:32.512
I saw what I saw.

30:32.762 --> 30:35.473
The boy drew the sword.

30:35.723 --> 30:38.851
If a boy has been chosen...

30:39.102 --> 30:41.102
...a boy shall be king.

30:41.312 --> 30:43.314
No, I challenge that.

30:43.564 --> 30:46.234
The sword has been drawn.

30:46.484 --> 30:50.905
Are you with us or against us?

30:51.155 --> 30:54.283
Against you.

31:31.571 --> 31:33.014
Why have you done this to me?

31:33.114 --> 31:35.016
Because you were born to be king.

31:35.116 --> 31:36.351
What does it mean to be king?

31:36.451 --> 31:38.895
You will be the land,
and the land will be you.

31:38.995 --> 31:41.375
If you fail, the land will perish.

31:41.497 --> 31:43.733
As you thrive, the land will blossom.

31:43.833 --> 31:45.863
- Why?
- Because you are king.

31:45.918 --> 31:48.463
No!

33:18.177 --> 33:20.455
- What are you afraid of?
- I don't know.

33:20.555 --> 33:23.333
- Shall I tell you what's out there?
- Yes, please.

33:23.433 --> 33:24.709
The Dragon.

33:24.809 --> 33:26.809
A beast of such power...

33:26.894 --> 33:31.215
...that if you were to see it whole
and complete in a single glance...

33:31.315 --> 33:33.217
...it would burn you to cinders.

33:33.317 --> 33:35.653
- Where is it?
- It is everywhere.

33:35.903 --> 33:37.513
It is everything.

33:37.613 --> 33:40.413
Its scales glisten in the bark of trees.

33:40.533 --> 33:42.785
Its roar is heard in the wind.

33:43.036 --> 33:46.956
And its forked tongue strikes like...

33:47.999 --> 33:51.002
Like lightning. Yes, that's it.

33:51.252 --> 33:52.695
How can I...?

33:52.795 --> 33:54.572
What shall I...? Must I...?

33:54.672 --> 33:56.491
Do nothing.

33:56.591 --> 33:59.260
Be still. Sleep.

33:59.510 --> 34:03.514
Rest in the arms of the Dragon.

34:03.598 --> 34:06.684
Dream.

34:22.408 --> 34:25.208
Excalibur. It's part of the Dragon, too.

34:25.328 --> 34:27.328
Oh, yes.

34:27.455 --> 34:29.455
Oh, you learn quickly.

34:29.540 --> 34:30.650
That's good.

34:30.750 --> 34:33.503
I like that.

34:34.212 --> 34:36.714
What kind of man was my father?

34:36.964 --> 34:39.759
Oh, he was brave, he was strong.

34:40.009 --> 34:41.327
He was a great knight.

34:41.427 --> 34:43.429
Was he a great king?

34:43.679 --> 34:45.723
Well, he was rash.

34:45.973 --> 34:48.918
He never learned how to look into men's hearts.

34:49.018 --> 34:50.545
Least of all his own.

34:50.645 --> 34:51.795
You loved him?

34:51.896 --> 34:56.775
Well, it is easy to love folly in a child.

34:57.110 --> 35:01.989
Merlin, will you help me to be wise,
not to be rash?

35:02.782 --> 35:04.058
Where are you going?

35:04.158 --> 35:07.228
Where do you think?
You have a kingdom to rule.

35:07.328 --> 35:09.914
But how? I don't know how.

35:10.164 --> 35:12.734
You knew how to draw the sword from the stone.

35:12.834 --> 35:14.402
- That was easy.
- Was it?

35:14.502 --> 35:15.862
I couldn't have done it.

35:15.962 --> 35:16.905
You couldn't?

35:17.005 --> 35:18.573
You're the King, not I.

35:18.673 --> 35:19.866
But where to start?

35:19.966 --> 35:22.911
Well, what do you think has happened
since you ran off?

35:23.011 --> 35:26.848
Sir Ector and Kay.
They must be waiting all this time.

35:27.098 --> 35:31.210
Most of the great knights were against me.
Except Leondegrance of Camelyarde.

35:31.310 --> 35:34.088
But if he supports me,
the others will turn against him.

35:34.188 --> 35:36.674
Even now they lay siege to his castle.

35:36.774 --> 35:38.343
I need him. We must help him.

35:38.443 --> 35:39.552
There you are.

35:39.652 --> 35:41.512
That was easy, too, wasn't it?

35:41.612 --> 35:43.264
We have to get back.

35:43.364 --> 35:44.891
That's it.

35:44.991 --> 35:46.601
Now...

35:46.701 --> 35:49.537
There they are.

35:52.332 --> 35:55.793
Well, you go and show them.

35:56.711 --> 35:59.756
Arthur, I knew you wouldn't fail us.

36:00.006 --> 36:01.282
Go on.

36:01.382 --> 36:03.801
I picked out a horse for you.

36:04.052 --> 36:07.538
All these men are loyal.
Now what do you want us to do?

36:07.638 --> 36:08.998
We waited here for you.

36:09.098 --> 36:12.643
Any man who would be a knight...

36:12.894 --> 36:15.134
...and follow a king, follow me.

36:15.313 --> 36:16.965
Where to? Where are we going?

36:17.065 --> 36:19.592
Leondegrance, his castle is under siege.

36:19.692 --> 36:21.010
Guenevere, get back.

36:21.110 --> 36:24.781
You're beaten, Leondegrance.

36:54.102 --> 36:56.896
Get the hook.

37:02.527 --> 37:05.363
Throw the rope.

37:36.936 --> 37:39.689
That's good.

38:03.004 --> 38:04.030
That's it.

38:04.130 --> 38:08.384
Now round the other side.
Uryens is attacking.

38:17.018 --> 38:19.937
Go on!

38:27.695 --> 38:29.781
Father!

38:30.031 --> 38:33.701
Hold on! Hold on!

38:45.546 --> 38:49.467
Take the knights in the moat.
Hold them off.

38:49.717 --> 38:52.970
I'm going for the ladder.

39:14.742 --> 39:17.620
Father, look.

39:18.997 --> 39:22.000
It's the boy king.

40:08.421 --> 40:11.674
Behind you.

40:20.641 --> 40:24.354
Swear faith to me and you shall have mercy.

40:24.604 --> 40:26.673
I need battle lords such as you.

40:26.773 --> 40:31.027
A noble knight swear faith to a squire?

40:31.277 --> 40:34.781
Never, never!

40:40.536 --> 40:44.582
You are right. I'm not yet a knight.

40:45.291 --> 40:50.213
You, Uryens, will knight me.

40:50.463 --> 40:55.093
Then, as knight to knight,
I can offer you mercy.

40:56.969 --> 40:58.969
What's this?

40:58.971 --> 41:01.849
What's this?

41:09.482 --> 41:13.194
Keep it, Uryens.

41:22.370 --> 41:25.773
In the name of God,
Saint Michael and Saint George...

41:25.873 --> 41:29.861
...I give you the right to bear arms
and the power to meet justice.

41:29.961 --> 41:32.271
That duty I will solemnly obey...

41:32.463 --> 41:34.757
...as knight and king.

41:35.008 --> 41:37.385
I never saw this.

41:37.635 --> 41:41.514
Rise, King Arthur.

41:42.765 --> 41:45.018
I am your humble knight...

41:45.268 --> 41:48.796
...and I swear allegiance
to the courage in your veins...

41:48.896 --> 41:50.896
...so strong it is...

41:51.024 --> 41:54.610
...its source must be Uther Pendragon.

41:54.861 --> 41:58.406
I doubt you no more.

42:25.391 --> 42:28.144
- It didn't hurt too much, did it?
- No.

42:28.394 --> 42:31.981
I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.

42:32.231 --> 42:36.110
Careful! You'll tear them open.

42:40.740 --> 42:42.559
You'll have to stay still and rest.

42:42.659 --> 42:45.328
How long?

42:45.370 --> 42:48.289
A few days.

43:07.809 --> 43:09.669
Oh, no! What is it?

43:09.769 --> 43:11.769
The stitches.

43:11.854 --> 43:14.065
It's all right.

43:14.315 --> 43:18.444
Come on, come on. Dance.

43:30.331 --> 43:32.361
A king must marry, after all.

43:32.500 --> 43:35.795
So it seems.

43:39.048 --> 43:43.302
I love her. If only she'd be my queen...

43:46.806 --> 43:49.767
Merlin, can you make her love me?

43:50.018 --> 43:51.085
Now, look.

43:51.185 --> 43:53.421
I once stood exposed to the Dragon's breath...

43:53.521 --> 43:55.590
...so a man could lie one night with a woman.

43:55.690 --> 43:58.140
It took me nine moons to recover...

43:58.234 --> 44:00.386
...and all for this lunacy called love...

44:00.486 --> 44:03.723
...this mad distemper,
that strikes down both beggar and king.

44:03.823 --> 44:06.034
Never again!

44:06.284 --> 44:08.870
Never!

44:14.500 --> 44:17.737
Who will I marry then?
You can tell me that at least.

44:17.837 --> 44:20.715
What do you see?

44:25.762 --> 44:29.557
Oh, Guenevere.

44:30.767 --> 44:35.146
And a beloved friend who will betray you.

44:35.772 --> 44:41.361
You're not listening. Your heart is not.
Love is deaf as well as blind.

44:45.031 --> 44:47.225
You have a land to quell before you can...

44:47.325 --> 44:51.746
...start all this hair pulling
and jumping about.

44:57.627 --> 44:59.796
I've made these only for you.

45:00.046 --> 45:03.491
I've mixed into them things
that will heal you, but not too quickly...

45:03.591 --> 45:07.245
...and they'll make you a little sleepy
so you can't escape.

45:07.345 --> 45:08.413
What's in them?

45:08.513 --> 45:10.513
It is an ancient mixture...

45:10.556 --> 45:12.558
...soft, unborn grains...

45:12.809 --> 45:15.812
...flavored with rose petals.

45:16.062 --> 45:19.107
The rest is secret.

45:25.655 --> 45:28.474
Looking at the cake is like
looking at the future.

45:28.574 --> 45:31.477
Until you have tasted it,
what do you really know?

45:31.577 --> 45:35.790
And then, of course, it's too late.

45:37.625 --> 45:40.211
Too late.

45:55.309 --> 45:58.104
We have won battles against armies.

45:58.354 --> 46:02.692
And now one man defeats all my knights.

46:03.943 --> 46:08.114
He's a mighty opponent.

46:11.534 --> 46:13.311
A hard man.

46:13.411 --> 46:14.437
I'll go myself.

46:14.537 --> 46:17.815
The King must not engage
in single combat. I'll go again.

46:17.915 --> 46:20.668
No, I will.

46:32.305 --> 46:36.059
Merlin, who is this knight?

46:36.142 --> 46:37.293
Look at him.

46:37.393 --> 46:38.878
So beautiful.

46:38.978 --> 46:41.606
So quick.

46:54.160 --> 46:55.353
Remember...

46:55.453 --> 46:59.999
...there's always something cleverer
than yourself.

47:09.884 --> 47:12.078
Move aside. This is the King's road...

47:12.178 --> 47:15.248
...and the knights you joined arms against
were his very own.

47:15.348 --> 47:17.000
I await the King himself.

47:17.100 --> 47:18.918
His knights are in need of training.

47:19.018 --> 47:22.939
I am King, and this...

47:23.064 --> 47:24.841
...is Excalibur...

47:24.941 --> 47:27.343
...sword of kings from the dawn of time.

47:27.443 --> 47:28.803
Who are you? What do you seek?

47:28.903 --> 47:32.615
I am Lancelot of the Lake,
from across the sea.

47:32.865 --> 47:35.935
And I have yet to find a king
worthy of my sword.

47:36.035 --> 47:39.664
That is a wild boast.
You lack a knight's humility.

47:39.914 --> 47:43.334
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.

47:43.584 --> 47:47.463
For I have never met my match in joust or duel.

47:47.714 --> 47:49.365
Move aside!

47:49.465 --> 47:50.742
I will not.

47:50.842 --> 47:52.452
You must retreat...

47:52.552 --> 47:56.205
...or prove your worth in the test of arms
under the eyes of God.

47:56.305 --> 47:58.875
Then may He give me the strength
to unhorse you...

47:58.975 --> 48:01.836
...and send you with one blow
back across the sea.

48:01.936 --> 48:05.106
Then come across, sir.

48:37.472 --> 48:40.375
You joust well, sir.
I offer you another lance.

48:40.475 --> 48:43.978
Yes. Yes. Another lance.

49:10.713 --> 49:13.257
Sword!

49:18.638 --> 49:19.706
Yield, sir.

49:19.806 --> 49:22.041
- I have the advantage.
- I will not.

49:22.141 --> 49:27.480
Fight me, on your horse or on foot,
but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.

49:27.730 --> 49:31.693
I sought only not to harm you.

49:53.339 --> 49:56.968
Your rage has unbalanced you.

49:58.094 --> 50:02.415
You, sir, would fight to the death
against a knight who is not your enemy.

50:02.515 --> 50:05.501
For a stretch of road
you could easily ride around.

50:05.601 --> 50:09.689
So be it, to the death.

51:15.588 --> 51:18.174
Excalibur...

51:18.424 --> 51:19.951
...I call...

51:20.051 --> 51:23.304
...on your power.

51:41.447 --> 51:44.742
Merlin, what have I done?

51:45.952 --> 51:48.371
You have broken...

51:48.621 --> 51:52.083
...what could not be broken.

51:53.459 --> 51:58.506
Hope is broken.

51:58.798 --> 52:00.883
My pride broke it.

52:01.134 --> 52:04.679
My rage broke it.

52:07.140 --> 52:09.000
This excellent knight...

52:09.100 --> 52:12.895
...who fought with fairness and grace
was meant to win.

52:13.146 --> 52:16.649
I used Excalibur to change that verdict.

52:16.899 --> 52:21.070
I have lost for all time
the ancient sword of my fathers...

52:21.320 --> 52:24.782
...whose power was meant to unite all men...

52:25.033 --> 52:29.662
...not to serve the vanity of a single man.

52:30.163 --> 52:34.000
I am nothing.

52:49.390 --> 52:52.518
The Lady of the Lake.

52:53.102 --> 52:55.980
Take it!

53:02.445 --> 53:04.445
Excalibur.

53:04.572 --> 53:05.723
Is it true?

53:05.823 --> 53:09.035
Take it! Quickly!

54:02.547 --> 54:05.550
Thanks be to God, you're alive.

54:05.800 --> 54:09.721
I, the best knight in the world, bested!

54:09.971 --> 54:12.140
This is a great day.

54:12.390 --> 54:17.020
For my search is over, my king.

54:17.311 --> 54:18.671
Make me your champion.

54:18.771 --> 54:20.882
But your life and lands are far from here.

54:20.982 --> 54:23.009
I give up my castle and my lands.

54:23.109 --> 54:25.445
Here is my domain...

54:25.695 --> 54:27.695
...within this metal skin.

54:27.780 --> 54:30.366
And I pledge all that I still own:

54:30.616 --> 54:35.121
Muscle, bone, blood,
and the heart that pumps it.

54:35.371 --> 54:37.232
And a great heart it is.

54:37.332 --> 54:41.419
Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.

55:08.321 --> 55:11.140
We killed every one of them!
Burnt their ships!

55:11.240 --> 55:13.101
Lancelot, how'd you fare in the North?

55:13.201 --> 55:16.396
We spared a few to tell what fate they met
at Arthur's hands.

55:16.496 --> 55:18.064
- And you, Uryens?
- Victory!

55:18.164 --> 55:19.232
Lot, and you?

55:19.332 --> 55:21.192
We drove the invaders back into the sea.

55:21.292 --> 55:22.235
Gawain, you?

55:22.335 --> 55:23.736
The East is ours again.

55:23.836 --> 55:27.548
The West is free and with us.

55:28.007 --> 55:30.007
The wars are over!

55:30.009 --> 55:32.345
One land, one king!

55:32.637 --> 55:35.264
Peace!

55:37.433 --> 55:40.103
Stand back!

55:40.395 --> 55:42.605
Be silent.

55:42.855 --> 55:45.441
Be still.

55:52.031 --> 55:54.283
That's it.

55:54.492 --> 55:56.577
And look upon this moment.

55:56.869 --> 55:58.605
Savor it.

55:58.705 --> 56:01.541
Rejoice with great gladness.

56:01.791 --> 56:03.791
Great gladness.

56:03.835 --> 56:06.129
Remember it, always...

56:06.379 --> 56:08.589
...for you are joined by it.

56:08.840 --> 56:13.428
You are one, under the stars.

56:14.887 --> 56:18.808
Remember it well then, this night...

56:19.058 --> 56:21.894
...this great victory...

56:22.145 --> 56:25.481
...so that in the years ahead you can say:

56:25.732 --> 56:30.653
'I was there that night,
with Arthur, the King.'

56:34.824 --> 56:39.495
For it is the doom of men that they forget.

56:44.042 --> 56:48.046
Your wisdom has forged this ring.

56:48.171 --> 56:52.258
Hereafter,
so that we remember our bonds...

56:52.508 --> 56:54.953
...we shall always come together in a circle...

56:55.053 --> 57:00.058
...to hear and tell of deeds good and brave.

57:00.808 --> 57:03.061
I will build a round table...

57:03.311 --> 57:05.588
...where this fellowship shall meet.

57:05.688 --> 57:07.815
And a hall about the table.

57:08.066 --> 57:11.152
And a castle about the hall.

57:11.402 --> 57:14.530
And I will marry.

57:16.157 --> 57:21.454
And the land will have an heir
to wield Excalibur.

57:23.915 --> 57:28.336
Knights of the Round Table.

57:39.722 --> 57:43.142
It's Sir Lancelot.

57:51.317 --> 57:53.903
Lancelot, welcome.

57:54.153 --> 57:56.280
This is a great day.

57:56.531 --> 58:00.994
Everything is prepared.
We'll leave at dawn.

58:01.911 --> 58:04.706
Guenevere...

58:05.039 --> 58:10.378
...here is Arthur's greatest knight
come to escort you to the King.

59:06.809 --> 59:08.839
They want me to ask you if...

59:08.895 --> 59:11.547
...any one of them could win your heart.

59:11.647 --> 59:13.383
I'm a fighting man.

59:13.483 --> 59:16.319
I'm sworn to the Quest.

59:16.569 --> 59:21.140
But surely there must be some lady
somewhere in the world who inspires you?

59:21.240 --> 59:23.993
There is one.

59:24.243 --> 59:25.937
Who is she?

59:26.037 --> 59:28.623
Oh, go on, tell me.

59:28.873 --> 59:31.376
You.

59:31.417 --> 59:33.194
You're teasing me.

59:33.294 --> 59:35.463
I will love you always.

59:35.713 --> 59:37.448
I will love you as my queen...

59:37.548 --> 59:40.278
...and as the wife of my best friend...

59:40.343 --> 59:42.720
...and while you live...

59:42.970 --> 59:46.557
...I will love no other.

01:00:21.592 --> 01:00:24.512
By the blood of Jesus Christ...

01:00:24.762 --> 01:00:28.057
...I join you in marriage.

01:00:29.642 --> 01:00:33.646
Man to woman.

01:00:34.188 --> 01:00:37.859
King to queen.

01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:43.823
Arthur to Guenevere.

01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:04.135
Don't you know me, Lord Merlin?

01:01:04.385 --> 01:01:07.805
Morgana of Cornwall.

01:01:08.306 --> 01:01:11.017
You have your father's eyes.

01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:13.044
I remember you.

01:01:13.144 --> 01:01:17.482
When my brother, Arthur, was born
you came and took him away.

01:01:17.732 --> 01:01:20.485
And now you leave his wedding.

01:01:20.735 --> 01:01:24.447
Because I am a creature like you.

01:01:25.823 --> 01:01:27.475
What is the stone that burns?

01:01:27.575 --> 01:01:30.453
Sulphur. To mix with mercury.

01:01:30.703 --> 01:01:33.748
What is that root?

01:01:39.253 --> 01:01:41.839
Mandrake.

01:01:43.049 --> 01:01:46.077
The essence of it can prolong the act of love.

01:01:46.177 --> 01:01:47.996
And if too much is taken?

01:01:48.096 --> 01:01:49.706
Pain and death.

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:51.583
That's it.

01:01:51.683 --> 01:01:55.353
Oh, you do know something of the Art.

01:01:55.603 --> 01:01:57.046
Do you have the Sight?

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:58.381
Do you see the future?

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:01.426
Sometimes, I dream of things that come to pass.

01:02:01.526 --> 01:02:02.594
Look now.

01:02:02.694 --> 01:02:03.886
What do you see?

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:06.364
What will be?

01:02:06.614 --> 01:02:08.994
I see a castle of silver and gold.

01:02:09.033 --> 01:02:09.934
Up there.

01:02:10.034 --> 01:02:12.954
That plan is well-known.

01:02:13.204 --> 01:02:17.375
You'll have to do better than that.

01:02:26.718 --> 01:02:28.761
It is a lonely way, you know.

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:30.830
The way of the necromancer.

01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:33.975
Yes, to know too much...

01:02:34.225 --> 01:02:36.002
...'lacrimae mundi'...

01:02:36.102 --> 01:02:37.795
...the tears of the world.

01:02:37.895 --> 01:02:40.064
But the power? The joy?

01:02:40.314 --> 01:02:42.525
Moments. Fleeting moments.

01:02:42.775 --> 01:02:44.775
I can ease your loneliness.

01:02:44.902 --> 01:02:48.281
Let me help you. Teach me.

01:02:48.489 --> 01:02:52.535
The days of our kind are numbered.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:56.789
The one God comes to drive out the many gods.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.667
The spirits of wood and stream...

01:02:59.917 --> 01:03:02.086
...grow silent.

01:03:02.337 --> 01:03:06.174
It's the way of things. Yes.

01:03:06.758 --> 01:03:11.137
It's a time for men and their ways.

01:04:12.183 --> 01:04:15.687
Run home to your mother, boy.

01:05:05.236 --> 01:05:07.906
Take me with you.

01:05:08.156 --> 01:05:11.284
I want to be a knight.

01:05:11.493 --> 01:05:13.912
I'll find food for you.

01:05:14.162 --> 01:05:17.540
Did you like the rabbit?

01:05:17.874 --> 01:05:22.144
Do you know what it means
to serve a knight who serves a king?

01:05:22.337 --> 01:05:23.780
Jump up.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.299
I'll run.

01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:27.784
Listen boy...

01:05:27.884 --> 01:05:29.911
...it's more than 20 days from here.

01:05:30.011 --> 01:05:33.973
Twenty days! The world's not that big.

01:05:39.479 --> 01:05:40.755
What's that?

01:05:40.855 --> 01:05:44.442
Camelot, the King's castle.

01:05:52.075 --> 01:05:54.175
- Cavalry!
- Lancelot, welcome.

01:05:54.327 --> 01:05:55.645
Hey, Lot.

01:05:55.745 --> 01:06:00.291
Hey, Lancelot. Great to see you.

01:06:27.152 --> 01:06:29.012
Will you train this lad to be my squire?

01:06:29.112 --> 01:06:32.073
Who'll give me my armor and sword?

01:06:32.323 --> 01:06:35.602
Kitchen knives and greasy spits
shall be your weapons, boy.

01:06:35.702 --> 01:06:38.580
To the kitchens.

01:06:43.126 --> 01:06:45.753
Look!

01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:50.116
Staying?

01:06:50.216 --> 01:06:54.095
There's a meeting of the Round Table.

01:07:01.227 --> 01:07:04.105
No. I can't.

01:07:26.878 --> 01:07:27.862
Sorry, old fellow.

01:07:27.962 --> 01:07:30.615
What're you doing here?
This is no place for an old man.

01:07:30.715 --> 01:07:32.492
I built it, dullard.

01:07:32.592 --> 01:07:35.912
- All on your own?
- Yes, and for the likes of you, it seems.

01:07:36.012 --> 01:07:39.933
Oh, well, then you can tell me
the way to the kitchen.

01:07:40.183 --> 01:07:43.144
Follow your nose.

01:08:07.377 --> 01:08:09.838
I'm dreaming.

01:08:10.088 --> 01:08:11.656
I must be dreaming.

01:08:11.756 --> 01:08:15.009
Get away from there, boy.

01:08:46.374 --> 01:08:48.684
Lancelot doesn't come, once more.

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:53.339
But we must fill his cup
to show our love for him.

01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:55.675
Watch Guenevere.

01:08:55.925 --> 01:08:59.720
Remember what I told you about them.

01:09:08.188 --> 01:09:11.232
Your eyes never leave me, Merlin.

01:09:11.483 --> 01:09:13.343
Can't I acknowledge beauty?

01:09:13.443 --> 01:09:16.821
Can't you acknowledge love?

01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:23.870
Perhaps you ache for what you've never known.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:28.625
Perhaps you lust for what you cannot have.

01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:31.877
Cannot have, but you promised.

01:09:32.127 --> 01:09:34.363
Your secrets.
You said you'd show me everything.

01:09:34.464 --> 01:09:38.091
I've shown you too much already.

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:41.453
Are you counselor to the King,
or to my sister?

01:09:41.554 --> 01:09:43.680
At your service, sir.

01:09:43.932 --> 01:09:45.932
Then answer me this.

01:09:46.142 --> 01:09:49.354
For years peace has reigned in the land.

01:09:49.604 --> 01:09:53.316
Crops grow in abundance, there's no want.

01:09:53.566 --> 01:09:57.721
Every one of my subjects enjoys
his portion of happiness and justice.

01:09:57.821 --> 01:10:00.390
Tell me, Merlin, have we defeated evil?

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:01.558
It seems we have.

01:10:01.658 --> 01:10:06.704
Good and evil,
there never is one without the other.

01:10:08.081 --> 01:10:12.001
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?

01:10:12.335 --> 01:10:15.004
Always...

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:19.342
...where you never expect it.

01:10:19.592 --> 01:10:22.095
Always.

01:10:24.722 --> 01:10:26.583
I know where.

01:10:26.683 --> 01:10:29.686
Where, Sir Gawain?

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.858
I cannot say.

01:10:35.316 --> 01:10:38.094
You must speak your heart.
You sit at the Round Table.

01:10:38.194 --> 01:10:41.239
Where is this evil?

01:10:42.866 --> 01:10:46.578
He's our best and bravest.

01:10:46.828 --> 01:10:48.828
Why then is he never here?

01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:52.750
Without Lancelot this Table is nothing.

01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:57.422
Is there anyone here
who doesn't think him a god?

01:10:57.672 --> 01:11:01.509
And now to be driven from us
by a woman's desire.

01:11:01.759 --> 01:11:07.765
In the idleness that comes with peace,
I see that gossip has bred its own evil.

01:11:12.729 --> 01:11:14.729
I will forgive your...

01:11:14.939 --> 01:11:17.901
...hasty words.

01:11:19.152 --> 01:11:21.779
Come.

01:11:21.821 --> 01:11:26.743
Drink from Lancelot's cup
and partake of his goodness.

01:12:09.911 --> 01:12:13.581
You dare accuse the Queen, Gawain?

01:12:13.915 --> 01:12:16.334
I do!

01:12:16.376 --> 01:12:17.819
I protest my innocence.

01:12:17.919 --> 01:12:23.633
Were I not king, I would make you pay
with your life for what you've said.

01:12:23.758 --> 01:12:26.418
- Will you not champion me?
- I cannot.

01:12:26.636 --> 01:12:29.748
I'm your king,
and I must be your judge in this.

01:12:29.848 --> 01:12:31.850
Lancelot must do it.

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.100
He also stands accused.

01:12:34.269 --> 01:12:35.920
I decree...

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:38.750
...that at sunrise two days from now...

01:12:38.982 --> 01:12:43.945
...the champions will meet,
and the truth shall be known.

01:12:44.487 --> 01:12:46.487
For by the law of God...

01:12:46.656 --> 01:12:49.876
...no knight who is false can win in combat...

01:12:50.118 --> 01:12:53.329
...with one who is true.

01:13:07.719 --> 01:13:09.871
You are the people I love best in the world.

01:13:09.971 --> 01:13:14.225
- Then why can't you defend me?
- The law!

01:13:18.396 --> 01:13:23.156
My laws must bind everyone,
high and low, or they're not laws at all.

01:13:23.401 --> 01:13:26.481
- You are my husband.
- I must be king first.

01:13:26.654 --> 01:13:27.639
Before husband?

01:13:27.739 --> 01:13:30.450
If need be.

01:13:33.495 --> 01:13:36.247
Before love?

01:13:40.001 --> 01:13:42.879
Lord, we are innocent...

01:13:43.129 --> 01:13:45.632
...but not in our hearts.

01:13:45.882 --> 01:13:48.743
To hold her once in my arms,
I would sacrifice everything:

01:13:48.843 --> 01:13:49.786
Honor.

01:13:49.886 --> 01:13:52.805
Truth. My sacred trust. God...

01:13:53.056 --> 01:13:57.769
...save me from myself,
purge me of this love...

01:13:58.019 --> 01:14:01.564
...so that I can defend her.

01:14:49.279 --> 01:14:51.279
I fight against myself.

01:14:51.281 --> 01:14:54.075
Oh, God!

01:15:16.097 --> 01:15:19.100
My lord, the sun is upon the field.

01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:22.687
The queen has no champion.

01:15:22.937 --> 01:15:24.839
I demand justice, as is my right.

01:15:24.939 --> 01:15:27.567
So it is.

01:15:40.663 --> 01:15:43.958
Let me champion the Queen!

01:15:46.169 --> 01:15:50.798
Since no knight comes forward,
I demand justice.

01:16:04.896 --> 01:16:06.896
Is there not one of you?

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:09.776
Let me through.

01:16:12.111 --> 01:16:14.823
Boy, kneel.

01:16:15.323 --> 01:16:16.850
In the name of God...

01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:18.226
...of Saint Michael...

01:16:18.326 --> 01:16:20.019
...and Saint George...

01:16:20.119 --> 01:16:21.771
...I make you a knight.

01:16:21.871 --> 01:16:23.871
Rise, Sir...

01:16:23.873 --> 01:16:27.126
- Perceval.
... Perceval.

01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:11.379
Lancelot!

01:17:40.450 --> 01:17:45.121
It's my task, Perceval,
to prove the queen's innocence.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.668
I yield to your mercy, Lancelot.

01:19:58.588 --> 01:20:01.716
The Queen is innocent!

01:20:22.237 --> 01:20:24.237
Look at your laws now.

01:20:24.405 --> 01:20:26.015
Look what they have done.

01:20:26.115 --> 01:20:28.977
- Save him, Merlin.
- He has no will to live.

01:20:29.077 --> 01:20:31.312
Bring him back, whatever the cost.

01:20:31.412 --> 01:20:34.749
Whatever the cost! Do it!

01:20:35.166 --> 01:20:37.919
So be it.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.570
- Will he live?
- Oh, yes.

01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:07.073
- Will Guenevere...?
- Yes.

01:21:07.532 --> 01:21:11.411
- Merlin, will I ever have a son?
- Yes.

01:21:11.452 --> 01:21:15.456
No riddles, nothing but a simple yes?
That frightens me.

01:21:15.707 --> 01:21:20.628
But a king should be afraid,
Arthur, always...

01:21:20.879 --> 01:21:24.257
...of the enemy waiting everywhere...

01:21:24.507 --> 01:21:26.659
...in the corridors of his castle...

01:21:26.759 --> 01:21:29.349
...on the deer paths of his forest...

01:21:29.387 --> 01:21:32.473
...or in a more tangled forest...

01:21:32.724 --> 01:21:35.393
...in here.

01:22:07.425 --> 01:22:10.178
Welcome, welcome back.

01:22:10.428 --> 01:22:12.539
Take your place again, Lancelot.

01:22:12.639 --> 01:22:14.639
My lord.

01:22:14.682 --> 01:22:18.895
Look! Sir Lancelot! He's back!

01:22:20.563 --> 01:22:23.525
No more going.

01:22:24.192 --> 01:22:28.404
They miss the battlefield.
I think we do, too.

01:22:28.530 --> 01:22:31.533
We have lost our way, Arthur.

01:22:31.783 --> 01:22:36.663
It is not easy for them without
the hard teaching of war and quest.

01:22:36.913 --> 01:22:41.584
It is only your example, Lancelot,
that binds them all.

01:22:43.628 --> 01:22:46.281
Which is the greatest quality of knighthood?

01:22:46.381 --> 01:22:48.716
Courage? Compassion? Loyalty?

01:22:48.967 --> 01:22:51.177
Humility?

01:22:51.427 --> 01:22:54.681
What do you say, Merlin?

01:23:01.146 --> 01:23:03.857
The greatest?

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:08.140
Well, they blend like the metals we mix
to make a good sword.

01:23:08.153 --> 01:23:11.097
No poetry. Just a straight answer.
Which is it?

01:23:11.197 --> 01:23:12.640
All right, then.

01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.740
Truth. That's it.

01:23:14.826 --> 01:23:18.621
Yes. It must be truth, above all.

01:23:18.872 --> 01:23:23.042
When a man lies,
he murders some part of the world.

01:23:23.293 --> 01:23:26.421
You should know that.

01:23:30.383 --> 01:23:33.803
I must take my rest in the forest.

01:23:34.053 --> 01:23:37.682
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?

01:23:38.349 --> 01:23:40.351
It is deep.

01:23:40.602 --> 01:23:43.771
You'll be sorely missed. Heal yourself...

01:23:44.022 --> 01:23:46.983
...and come back.

01:24:48.211 --> 01:24:50.071
Do you still have the Sight, Merlin?

01:24:50.171 --> 01:24:53.007
Are they together?

01:24:53.258 --> 01:24:55.802
Yes.

01:24:57.846 --> 01:25:01.516
You warned me of this, all those years ago.

01:25:01.766 --> 01:25:05.311
What must I do now, kill them?

01:25:07.438 --> 01:25:09.482
I can tell you nothing more.

01:25:09.732 --> 01:25:11.734
My days are ended.

01:25:11.985 --> 01:25:15.280
The gods of once are gone forever.

01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:17.182
It's a time for men.

01:25:17.282 --> 01:25:19.284
It's your time, Arthur.

01:25:19.534 --> 01:25:21.828
I need you now, more than ever.

01:25:22.078 --> 01:25:23.772
No.

01:25:23.872 --> 01:25:26.441
This is the moment
that you must face at last...

01:25:26.541 --> 01:25:28.751
...to be king alone.

01:25:29.002 --> 01:25:32.338
And you, old friend?

01:25:34.048 --> 01:25:35.533
Will I see you again?

01:25:35.633 --> 01:25:38.219
No.

01:25:38.887 --> 01:25:40.889
There are other worlds.

01:25:41.139 --> 01:25:44.434
This one is done with me.

01:25:56.571 --> 01:25:59.282
That's it.

01:26:33.441 --> 01:26:36.736
Bat wing. Snake skin.

01:26:36.986 --> 01:26:39.506
Is this all you've learned, Morgana?

01:26:39.531 --> 01:26:44.118
To deal in potions and petty evil.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.938
And where have your meddling arts
brought the world?

01:26:47.038 --> 01:26:50.124
To the edge of ruin.

01:26:50.333 --> 01:26:54.128
I'm worn thin and threadbare.

01:26:54.379 --> 01:26:57.866
I've tried to guide men,
or meddled in their affairs...

01:26:57.966 --> 01:27:01.010
...as you would have it, for far too long.

01:27:01.261 --> 01:27:05.265
The time has come for me to go.

01:27:08.393 --> 01:27:10.979
Forgive me. Where are you going?

01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:12.589
Whence I came.

01:27:12.689 --> 01:27:14.689
Merlin, take me with you.

01:27:14.899 --> 01:27:17.802
The Charm of Making,
you swore to pass it to me.

01:27:17.902 --> 01:27:20.488
You think you're ready?

01:27:20.738 --> 01:27:23.283
Are you worthy?

01:27:23.533 --> 01:27:25.702
I am.

01:27:25.952 --> 01:27:27.952
I am.

01:27:27.996 --> 01:27:31.374
Then follow me.

01:28:12.207 --> 01:28:13.650
What is this place?

01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:16.550
Here, you enter the coils of the Dragon.

01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:19.130
Here, my power was born.

01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:21.491
Here, all things are possible...

01:28:21.591 --> 01:28:25.178
...and all things meet their opposites.

01:28:25.428 --> 01:28:27.205
The future?

01:28:27.305 --> 01:28:29.305
And the past.

01:28:29.432 --> 01:28:30.875
Desire?

01:28:30.975 --> 01:28:32.977
And regret.

01:28:33.228 --> 01:28:34.629
Knowledge?

01:28:34.729 --> 01:28:37.482
And oblivion.

01:28:37.649 --> 01:28:39.818
Love?

01:28:40.068 --> 01:28:42.111
Oh, yes.

01:28:42.362 --> 01:28:44.906
Look.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.205
More.

01:29:09.305 --> 01:29:12.100
Show me more.

01:29:12.141 --> 01:29:13.460
Show me the Dragon.

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.604
Tell me the sacred Charm of Making.

01:29:16.855 --> 01:29:19.424
Even though such knowledge would burn...

01:29:19.524 --> 01:29:21.568
...and blind you?

01:29:21.818 --> 01:29:24.612
Then burn me.

01:30:01.441 --> 01:30:04.986
Look into the eyes of the Dragon,
and despair.

01:30:05.236 --> 01:30:10.074
I destroy you. I consign you to oblivion.

01:30:28.718 --> 01:30:31.262
Arthur...

01:30:31.513 --> 01:30:36.601
Excalibur, into the spine of the Dragon!

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.087
The sword! The land!

01:30:39.187 --> 01:30:42.048
Yes, Merlin. That's it.
Set the world to rights.

01:30:42.148 --> 01:30:44.609
Call the Dragon.

01:30:44.859 --> 01:30:46.636
Mend the sword.

01:30:46.736 --> 01:30:50.615
Speak the Charm of Making.

01:31:35.451 --> 01:31:37.451
You fool!

01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.720
You thought you would trap me.

01:31:39.831 --> 01:31:45.211
You are trapped yourself, by the same
sorcery you used to deceive my mother.

01:31:45.461 --> 01:31:47.155
You're nothing.

01:31:47.255 --> 01:31:49.705
You're not a god, you're not a man.

01:31:49.799 --> 01:31:55.013
I shall find a man and give birth to a god.

01:32:26.753 --> 01:32:30.048
The King without a sword!

01:32:30.256 --> 01:32:33.510
The land without a king!

01:33:03.873 --> 01:33:06.000
Love me.

01:33:06.251 --> 01:33:09.170
Love me.

01:33:09.712 --> 01:33:14.175
- Guenevere...
- Forget and love me.

01:33:17.512 --> 01:33:22.016
I have conceived a son, my king...

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:25.687
...my brother.

01:33:26.437 --> 01:33:29.649
I could kill you now, brother.

01:33:29.899 --> 01:33:34.779
But I want you to live to see our son be king.

01:34:22.118 --> 01:34:25.622
God save us from Morgana.

01:34:25.872 --> 01:34:30.835
And save us from her unholy child.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.936
Is he dead?

01:34:48.186 --> 01:34:51.397
No, he lives.

01:34:53.858 --> 01:34:56.444
A knight...

01:34:56.528 --> 01:34:59.072
Help us.

01:34:59.322 --> 01:35:01.057
Help us, please.

01:35:01.157 --> 01:35:04.577
We're dying. Our children are dying.

01:35:04.828 --> 01:35:07.497
Where is the King?

01:35:07.747 --> 01:35:10.875
Please, help us!

01:35:30.145 --> 01:35:33.231
We must find what was lost.

01:35:33.481 --> 01:35:35.733
The Grail...

01:35:35.984 --> 01:35:41.072
Only the Grail can restore leaf and flower.

01:35:41.322 --> 01:35:43.700
Search the land...

01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:47.203
...the labyrinths of the forests...

01:35:47.453 --> 01:35:49.956
...to the edge of...

01:35:50.206 --> 01:35:52.917
...within.

01:35:53.042 --> 01:35:56.045
Only the Grail can redeem us.

01:35:56.296 --> 01:35:58.506
Search.

01:35:58.548 --> 01:36:00.717
Seek.

01:36:00.967 --> 01:36:04.179
Where do we look for it?

01:36:05.722 --> 01:36:08.641
Portents...

01:36:08.975 --> 01:36:11.895
...signs...

01:36:12.437 --> 01:36:15.231
...follow.

01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:23.323
The King has spoken.

01:36:23.573 --> 01:36:26.226
I will ride forth in the name of that quest.

01:36:26.326 --> 01:36:29.954
We will find this grail or die.

01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:54.400
Have you found it? The Grail.

01:37:54.539 --> 01:37:57.625
It's me, Perceval.

01:38:08.178 --> 01:38:11.389
We will never find it.

01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:57.977
Gawain!

01:39:37.559 --> 01:39:40.103
You seek what Arthur wants?

01:39:40.353 --> 01:39:42.756
- That thing they call the Grail?
- I do.

01:39:42.856 --> 01:39:45.984
Then follow me.

01:40:17.348 --> 01:40:22.353
They were looking for it, too,
but they weren't good enough.

01:40:57.013 --> 01:41:01.726
Mordred, my lovely, clever boy.

01:41:05.730 --> 01:41:08.900
You have crossed the great wasteland.

01:41:09.150 --> 01:41:12.570
You are burning with thirst.

01:41:13.321 --> 01:41:15.907
Drink.

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:21.600
For ten years and a day you have searched.

01:41:21.746 --> 01:41:23.148
Is it so long?

01:41:23.248 --> 01:41:26.000
And tell me...

01:41:26.042 --> 01:41:28.282
...have you found what you seek?

01:41:28.336 --> 01:41:33.508
I have found nothing but sorrow and death.

01:41:35.593 --> 01:41:39.180
I never thought to hear laughter again...

01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:42.016
...till I saw this boy.

01:41:42.267 --> 01:41:45.520
He promised me the Grail.

01:41:46.354 --> 01:41:47.505
Is it here?

01:41:47.605 --> 01:41:51.109
You have searched too hard.

01:41:51.526 --> 01:41:54.571
Take your ease.

01:41:57.490 --> 01:42:01.411
Drink, and join with me.

01:42:13.673 --> 01:42:17.385
Bors! You're here!

01:42:18.386 --> 01:42:21.181
Meliot! You, too.

01:42:21.431 --> 01:42:23.431
You are alive.

01:42:23.516 --> 01:42:26.753
There is no grail,
as these good knights have found.

01:42:26.853 --> 01:42:28.980
They serve me instead.

01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:33.176
There are many pleasures in the world,
many cups to drink from...

01:42:33.276 --> 01:42:37.280
...and they shall be yours. Drink.

01:42:37.489 --> 01:42:40.283
No!

01:42:40.533 --> 01:42:43.661
He's no good, Mother.

01:42:48.208 --> 01:42:51.294
Take him to the tree.

01:42:57.091 --> 01:42:59.177
No!

01:42:59.427 --> 01:43:02.555
There is a grail!

01:44:17.005 --> 01:44:23.469
{Y: i}What is the secret of the Grail?

01:44:23.553 --> 01:44:27.724
{Y: i}Who does it serve?

01:45:01.049 --> 01:45:04.594
Arthur, the secret was in my grasp.

01:45:04.844 --> 01:45:07.597
I failed you.

01:45:18.650 --> 01:45:21.569
When am I going to be king, Mother?

01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:26.616
When the time comes,
I will send you to your father.

01:45:27.158 --> 01:45:32.622
You will take what is yours
and then you will be king.

01:45:37.210 --> 01:45:39.796
No spear. No sword.

01:45:40.046 --> 01:45:41.364
No arrow.

01:45:41.464 --> 01:45:44.676
No lance. No blade.

01:45:44.926 --> 01:45:48.179
No weapon forged by man...

01:45:48.429 --> 01:45:51.509
...will harm you whilst you wear this armor.

01:45:51.599 --> 01:45:55.687
Any message for your dear brother,
my father?

01:45:55.937 --> 01:45:59.149
You are my message.

01:46:31.306 --> 01:46:34.601
Keep a distance, Mordred.

01:46:37.979 --> 01:46:41.024
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.

01:46:41.274 --> 01:46:44.027
Show yourself.

01:46:55.497 --> 01:46:59.292
I cannot give you the land...

01:47:01.711 --> 01:47:04.214
...only my love.

01:47:04.464 --> 01:47:08.259
That's the only thing of yours I don't want.

01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:10.762
The Quest Knights have failed.

01:47:11.012 --> 01:47:13.431
They're all dead.

01:47:13.681 --> 01:47:17.227
You are dead, too.

01:47:17.852 --> 01:47:22.273
I shall come back and take Camelot by force.

01:47:51.135 --> 01:47:53.763
Uryens!

01:48:01.187 --> 01:48:03.214
Renounce the King and I'll spare your life.

01:48:03.314 --> 01:48:06.109
Never!

01:48:07.235 --> 01:48:09.863
So be it.

01:49:23.478 --> 01:49:26.105
Uryens...

01:49:29.484 --> 01:49:31.136
I was afraid to help you.

01:49:31.236 --> 01:49:35.532
Perceval, never give up the Quest.

01:49:36.199 --> 01:49:38.910
I saw the Grail, Uryens.

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.913
It was in my grasp.

01:49:42.163 --> 01:49:44.707
I failed.

01:49:45.416 --> 01:49:48.962
You are the last of us. Try again.

01:49:49.212 --> 01:49:51.214
I am not worthy.

01:49:51.464 --> 01:49:54.676
You must... you...

01:49:58.346 --> 01:50:01.057
Listen!

01:50:01.933 --> 01:50:04.561
Follow.

01:50:07.647 --> 01:50:10.441
They call you.

01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:46.961
All around is death!

01:50:47.061 --> 01:50:48.713
Death everywhere!

01:50:48.813 --> 01:50:50.715
All of you will come to death...

01:50:50.815 --> 01:50:54.010
...for it is our constant companion
through life as we trudge...

01:50:54.110 --> 01:50:55.804
...through this weary...

01:50:55.904 --> 01:51:01.284
...and tragic scene
of the valley of the shadow of death.

01:51:01.993 --> 01:51:06.289
Look at the great knight!

01:51:06.498 --> 01:51:09.667
Peace and plenty they promised.

01:51:09.918 --> 01:51:12.298
But what did they give us instead?

01:51:12.462 --> 01:51:15.381
Famine and pestilence.

01:51:15.632 --> 01:51:17.909
- Lancelot, is it you?
- And death.

01:51:18.009 --> 01:51:20.954
Because of their pride,
and because of their sin...

01:51:21.054 --> 01:51:25.350
- It's me, Perceval.
... God has left the world.

01:51:32.816 --> 01:51:35.318
They made themselves God...

01:51:35.568 --> 01:51:39.197
...and Christ has abandoned us.

01:51:45.578 --> 01:51:50.250
Lancelot, won't you help us?
Come back to us, Lancelot!

01:51:50.834 --> 01:51:52.919
Arthur needs you!

01:51:53.169 --> 01:51:55.630
Lancelot!

01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:48.725
I can't give up hope, Lancelot.

01:52:49.559 --> 01:52:52.479
It's all I have.

01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:31.392
{Y: i}What is the secret of the Grail?

01:53:31.601 --> 01:53:35.230
{Y: i}Who does it serve?

01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:38.441
You, my lord.

01:53:41.569 --> 01:53:45.281
{Y: i}Who am I?

01:53:45.532 --> 01:53:48.326
You are my lord and king.

01:53:48.576 --> 01:53:51.371
You are Arthur.

01:53:51.621 --> 01:53:54.916
{Y: i}Have you found the secret...

01:53:55.166 --> 01:53:57.377
{Y: i}...that I have lost?

01:53:57.627 --> 01:53:59.627
Yes.

01:53:59.712 --> 01:54:02.966
You and the land are one.

01:54:25.613 --> 01:54:27.866
You and the land are one. Drink.

01:54:28.116 --> 01:54:30.116
I am wasting away.

01:54:30.243 --> 01:54:33.204
I cannot die and I cannot live.

01:54:33.454 --> 01:54:38.668
Drink from the chalice.
You will be reborn and the land with you.

01:54:50.096 --> 01:54:52.807
Perceval...

01:54:54.225 --> 01:54:57.479
...I didn't know how empty was my soul...

01:54:57.729 --> 01:55:00.982
...until it was filled.

01:55:09.073 --> 01:55:10.517
Arthur!

01:55:10.617 --> 01:55:14.312
Ready my knights for battle.
They will ride with their king once more.

01:55:14.412 --> 01:55:17.148
I have lived through others far too long.

01:55:17.248 --> 01:55:20.627
Lancelot carried my honor
and Guenevere my guilt.

01:55:20.877 --> 01:55:22.877
Mordred bore my sins.

01:55:22.879 --> 01:55:25.840
My knights have fought my causes.

01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:28.176
Now, my brother...

01:55:28.426 --> 01:55:32.096
...I shall be king.

01:55:36.226 --> 01:55:38.353
Guards!

01:55:38.603 --> 01:55:40.647
Knights!

01:55:40.897 --> 01:55:42.941
Squires!

01:55:43.191 --> 01:55:46.277
Prepare for battle!

01:57:25.585 --> 01:57:28.296
Guenevere...

01:57:32.759 --> 01:57:34.761
...accept my forgiveness...

01:57:35.011 --> 01:57:37.138
...and put your heart to rest.

01:57:37.388 --> 01:57:39.474
We've suffered too long.

01:57:39.724 --> 01:57:43.102
I have always loved you, and still love you.

01:57:43.353 --> 01:57:45.605
I loved you as king...

01:57:45.855 --> 01:57:49.150
...sometimes as husband...

01:57:49.859 --> 01:57:54.030
...but one cannot gaze too long at the sun.

01:57:54.322 --> 01:57:58.326
Forgive me, my wife, if you can.

01:58:03.581 --> 01:58:06.241
I was not born to live a man's life...

01:58:06.251 --> 01:58:10.880
...but to be the stuff of future memory.

01:58:11.089 --> 01:58:14.217
The fellowship was a brief beginning...

01:58:14.467 --> 01:58:18.513
...a fair time that cannot be forgotten.

01:58:18.930 --> 01:58:22.642
And because it will not be forgotten...

01:58:22.892 --> 01:58:26.771
...that fair time may come again.

01:58:27.981 --> 01:58:31.061
Now once more I must ride with my knights...

01:58:31.192 --> 01:58:33.361
...to defend what was...

01:58:33.611 --> 01:58:37.323
...and the dream of what could be.

01:58:51.087 --> 01:58:53.798
I kept it.

01:59:03.558 --> 01:59:08.897
I never dared to hope, all these years,
that it was in your keeping.

01:59:11.483 --> 01:59:13.483
I have often thought...

01:59:13.610 --> 01:59:17.989
...that in the hereafter of our lives...

01:59:18.490 --> 01:59:20.683
...when I owe no more to the future...

01:59:20.783 --> 01:59:24.329
...and can be just a man...

01:59:24.370 --> 01:59:28.958
...that we may meet and you will come to me...

01:59:29.209 --> 01:59:31.544
...and claim me yours...

01:59:31.794 --> 01:59:35.548
...and know that I am your husband.

01:59:42.263 --> 01:59:45.850
It is a dream I have.

02:00:13.211 --> 02:00:14.863
It is only me and my son.

02:00:14.963 --> 02:00:17.741
All other knights of the dukedom
have rallied to Mordred.

02:00:17.841 --> 02:00:20.343
What's that smoke yonder?

02:00:20.593 --> 02:00:22.593
That is Mordred's army.

02:00:22.762 --> 02:00:27.308
Then let us camp here tonight,
and fight tomorrow.

02:00:43.324 --> 02:00:45.994
Merlin...

02:00:46.703 --> 02:00:51.916
...if only you were at my side,
my old friend, to give me courage.

02:00:52.584 --> 02:00:58.131
There are no war tricks
that will fool Mordred and Morgana.

02:01:03.761 --> 02:01:07.640
More than I ever did, I need you now.

02:01:13.313 --> 02:01:16.483
Where are you, Merlin?

02:01:17.442 --> 02:01:19.903
If only you could see me...

02:01:20.153 --> 02:01:24.324
...wield Excalibur once more.

02:01:38.505 --> 02:01:41.132
Arthur...

02:01:45.011 --> 02:01:47.931
Where have you been these many years?

02:01:48.181 --> 02:01:51.768
- Is it true that Morgana...
- Stories.

02:01:52.018 --> 02:01:56.439
You brought me back.
Your love brought me back.

02:01:56.689 --> 02:01:59.442
Back to where you are now...

02:01:59.692 --> 02:02:02.779
...in the land of dreams.

02:02:03.029 --> 02:02:06.157
Are you just a dream?

02:02:07.033 --> 02:02:10.453
A dream to some...

02:02:10.703 --> 02:02:14.249
...a nightmare to others.

02:02:29.556 --> 02:02:32.267
Kay, wake up, my brother.

02:02:32.517 --> 02:02:33.752
I was dreaming.

02:02:33.852 --> 02:02:34.961
Of Merlin?

02:02:35.061 --> 02:02:37.147
Yes. He spoke to me.

02:02:37.397 --> 02:02:39.732
I dreamed of him, too.

02:02:39.983 --> 02:02:42.694
Merlin lives.

02:02:45.071 --> 02:02:47.490
He lives in our dreams now.

02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:50.368
He speaks to us from there.

02:02:50.618 --> 02:02:54.539
He said I would fight bravely tomorrow.

02:03:32.827 --> 02:03:37.665
I have returned, enchantress.

02:03:37.957 --> 02:03:39.957
You are beautiful.

02:03:40.084 --> 02:03:41.528
Yes.

02:03:41.628 --> 02:03:43.796
Magnificent.

02:03:44.047 --> 02:03:47.547
Have you used up all the magic
you stole from me...

02:03:47.592 --> 02:03:50.929
...to keep yourself so young?

02:03:51.179 --> 02:03:54.516
Have you any magic left...

02:03:54.766 --> 02:03:58.269
...to do battle with Merlin?

02:03:58.561 --> 02:04:03.566
Nothing to fear from an old man
you vanquished long ago...

02:04:03.817 --> 02:04:08.655
...who only wants to see
how powerful you've become.

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:13.660
You see, Morgana,
you made me into a dream...

02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:16.621
...a shadow.

02:04:21.459 --> 02:04:23.545
A shadow.

02:04:23.795 --> 02:04:27.882
You must be greater than ever I was.

02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:30.702
I once released the Dragon's breath...

02:04:30.802 --> 02:04:35.557
...so Uther could lie with your mother
and beget a king.

02:04:36.558 --> 02:04:39.811
It almost destroyed me.

02:04:40.478 --> 02:04:46.109
But I expect you could do it quite easily,
couldn't you?

02:04:49.279 --> 02:04:52.198
I see no mist.

02:04:53.449 --> 02:04:56.786
Have your powers faded, too?

02:04:57.036 --> 02:04:59.038
The Charm.

02:04:59.289 --> 02:05:01.289
That's it.

02:05:01.416 --> 02:05:04.878
Use the Charm.

02:05:06.421 --> 02:05:10.341
Have you forgotten the Charm of Making?

02:05:11.634 --> 02:05:14.179
Use it.

02:05:36.993 --> 02:05:40.788
Yes, use it.

02:05:43.124 --> 02:05:44.401
That's it.

02:05:44.501 --> 02:05:46.152
Oh, good.

02:05:46.252 --> 02:05:49.172
Oh, that's grand.

02:05:55.553 --> 02:05:59.766
That's better than I ever was.

02:06:04.562 --> 02:06:06.172
Careful.

02:06:06.272 --> 02:06:10.068
It can damage your beauty.

02:06:29.712 --> 02:06:31.712
A fog is rising.

02:06:31.881 --> 02:06:33.658
Fog?

02:06:33.758 --> 02:06:36.553
That cannot be.

02:06:37.971 --> 02:06:41.583
My mother has a sense for such things.
She said there would be no fog.

02:06:41.683 --> 02:06:45.436
It will stand against us in battle.

02:06:53.611 --> 02:06:54.721
Merlin?

02:06:54.821 --> 02:06:58.283
Where are you? Where are you?

02:06:58.533 --> 02:07:01.161
Mother?

02:07:01.828 --> 02:07:05.582
My dear, sweet boy.

02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:54.422
- Where are they?
- Listen.

02:08:02.889 --> 02:08:05.083
They won't know how few we are in the fog.

02:08:05.183 --> 02:08:07.352
We'll use the old ways.

02:08:07.602 --> 02:08:10.396
Speed up horse.

02:08:18.154 --> 02:08:21.533
They're attacking from behind us!

02:08:21.783 --> 02:08:24.023
- Turn about!
- Look to the rear!

02:08:24.244 --> 02:08:27.288
You dogs, move!

02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:46.284
- There are too many!
- We can't hold them!

02:09:46.534 --> 02:09:50.914
Lancelot, is it you?

02:09:54.626 --> 02:09:57.712
- Is it true?
- It is.

02:10:04.177 --> 02:10:06.262
Lancelot's with us.

02:10:06.513 --> 02:10:09.891
He's back, he's with us.

02:10:57.313 --> 02:11:00.108
Oh, my God!

02:11:01.818 --> 02:11:04.612
Arthur!

02:11:27.802 --> 02:11:30.513
Arthur...

02:11:32.056 --> 02:11:34.642
Forgive.

02:11:36.728 --> 02:11:40.648
My salvation is to die
a Knight of the Round Table.

02:11:40.899 --> 02:11:44.486
You are that and much more.

02:11:44.736 --> 02:11:46.513
You are its greatest knight...

02:11:46.613 --> 02:11:50.617
...you are what is best in men.

02:11:51.868 --> 02:11:55.497
It is the old wound, my king.

02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:58.666
It has never healed.

02:12:02.212 --> 02:12:04.964
Guenevere...

02:12:05.757 --> 02:12:07.158
...is she queen again?

02:12:07.258 --> 02:12:10.720
She is, Lancelot.

02:12:19.437 --> 02:12:22.440
The fog is lifting.

02:12:28.279 --> 02:12:31.699
No, Perceval.

02:12:43.962 --> 02:12:45.780
Come, Father.

02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:49.175
Let us embrace at last.

02:13:14.951 --> 02:13:17.662
Perceval...

02:13:17.912 --> 02:13:20.874
...take Excalibur.

02:13:21.332 --> 02:13:24.961
Find a pool...

02:13:25.211 --> 02:13:28.882
...of calm water...

02:13:29.257 --> 02:13:32.427
...throw the sword into it...

02:13:32.677 --> 02:13:34.120
No.

02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:36.220
Obey me, Perceval.

02:13:36.431 --> 02:13:39.893
Do it and return.

02:15:15.155 --> 02:15:18.366
When you cast it in...

02:15:18.616 --> 02:15:20.910
...what did you see?

02:15:21.161 --> 02:15:24.038
I saw nothing...

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:27.542
...but the wind on the water.

02:15:27.625 --> 02:15:29.961
My king, I couldn't do it.

02:15:30.211 --> 02:15:32.255
Excalibur cannot be lost.

02:15:32.505 --> 02:15:36.050
- Other men...
- Do as I command.

02:15:36.801 --> 02:15:39.846
One day a king will come...

02:15:40.096 --> 02:15:44.017
...and the sword will rise again.
