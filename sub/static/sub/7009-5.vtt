12:48.559 --> 12:51.060
YOU KNOW, JACKIE,
I'VE BEEN WRACKING MY BRAIN

12:51.228 --> 12:53.396
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY THIS GUY DIDN'T HIRE ME.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.440

I HAVE TO SAY THAT.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.126
OH! OH, OK.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.628
WELL, I WAS ON A BREAK
FROM THE HOSPITAL,

15:21.795 --> 15:24.005
SO I THOUGHT I'D BRING
YOU SOME NICE HOT SOUP.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.548
OH...

15:25.716 --> 15:26.966

15:33.140 --> 15:34.641
IT'S GREAT.

15:34.808 --> 15:35.892
SO HOW'S IT GOING?

15:36.060 --> 15:36.726
IT'S TERRIBLE.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.311
MM-HMM.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.813
I'M EXHAUSTED, I'M BEHIND ON
ALL MY HOMEWORK,

15:40.981 --> 15:42.273
AND I THINK THIS
POLYESTER UNIFORM

15:42.441 --> 15:44.651
IS GIVING ME A BODY RASH.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.654
OH, OH, UM, I SWEPT
THE DRIVEWAY FOR YOU.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.073
OH! OH, MOM, I'M SORRY.
I FORGOT.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.824
THAT'S OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?
HERE, I'LL DO THIS.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.494
YOU SIT DOWN,

15:54.662 --> 15:59.082
AND YOU EAT YOUR SOUP.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.334
YOU KNOW, UM,

16:01.502 --> 16:02.961
ERIC, IF YOU WANT TO QUIT,

16:03.128 --> 16:06.756
YOUR FATHER AND I
WILL COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.257
DID DAD TELL YOU THAT?

16:08.425 --> 16:10.009
WELL, YOU LEAVE
YOUR FATHER TO ME.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.053
YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT YOU.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.764
HEY, FORMAN,
WHO SAID YOU WERE ON BREAK?

16:14.932 --> 16:15.723
I DID.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.141
AND WHO ARE YOU?

16:17.309 --> 16:18.434
I'M HIS MOTHER.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.353
GOOD ENOUGH THEN.

16:23.148 --> 16:27.402
MICHAEL, SIT.
WE NEED TO TALK.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.278
WHOA. HA HA.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.864
AHOY, JACKIE.
WELCOME ABOARD THE U.S.S. KELSO.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.574
HA HA HA.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.660
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK

16:35.828 --> 16:39.038
YOU'RE A REAL SCREWUP.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.791
YOU SEE, ONE DAY,
I WANT A HOUSE AND KIDS

16:41.959 --> 16:43.710
AND MAYBE A CHANDELIER.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.004
AND IF YOU CAN'T GIVE ME
THOSE THINGS, MICHAEL,

16:46.171 --> 16:48.131
THEN THIS IS ALL
A BIG WASTE OF TIME.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.969
YOU JUST
GOTTA TRY HARDER.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.850
WAIT. MICHAEL,
SOMETHING FEELS WET.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.145
Michael, thinking:
"DEAR PENTHOUSE...

17:02.312 --> 17:05.273
NO, NO! YOU
POPPED THE WATERBED!

17:07.359 --> 17:11.195
IT MUST HAVE
BEEN MY ROACH CLIP.

17:11.363 --> 17:16.409
WELL, JACKIE, MAYBE
THEY WON'T NOTICE.

17:16.577 --> 17:20.288
I AM IN LOVE
WITH A DOOFUS.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.002
HEY.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.003
DONNA?

17:27.171 --> 17:30.715
OH, UH, WELCOME TO FATSO BURGER.
HOW... AH, SCREW IT.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.550
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

17:32.718 --> 17:35.303
OH, I WAS BORED.
AHEM.

17:35.471 --> 17:39.098
REALLY? YOU LEFT YOUR OWN PARTY
TO COME SEE ME?

17:39.266 --> 17:42.727
IT'S NOT MUCH OF A PARTY
WITHOUT YOU THERE.

17:44.938 --> 17:45.772
YOU'RE SO QUEER.

17:45.939 --> 17:48.858
SHUT UP!

17:49.026 --> 17:49.859
UM...

17:50.027 --> 17:52.028
ERIC, THE WHOLE REASON I TOLD
YOU MY PARENTS WERE GOING AWAY

17:52.196 --> 17:55.198
IS SO WE COULD HANG...

17:55.365 --> 17:56.783
TOGETHER,

17:56.950 --> 17:58.743
YOU KNOW, ALONE.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.495
YEAH.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.791
I KNOW, IT'S JUST, UH...

18:09.671 --> 18:12.173
SO, UM...

18:14.802 --> 18:17.845
LOOK, DONNA, I'M SORRY.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.138
OK, I WOULD LOVE
TO COME OVER,

18:19.306 --> 18:21.808
BUT THIS IS MY JOB.

18:21.975 --> 18:26.062
AND, UH,
WORK ISN'T FUN, YOU KNOW?

18:26.230 --> 18:29.148
IT'S WORK.

18:29.316 --> 18:33.152
AND ONLY QUITTERS QUIT.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.322
WELL, AS LONG AS YOU
KNOW WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.909
I'LL, UM, SEE YOU AROUND.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.841
OW!

18:58.554 --> 19:03.099
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW,
KELSO, WE'RE OUT OF BEER.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.518
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORMAN'S OLD MAN'S GOT A FRIDGE

19:05.686 --> 19:07.645
IN THE GARAGE,
AND I KNOW HE'S GOT BEER IN IT.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.942
[CRASH]

19:19.158 --> 19:20.741
AAH!
AAH!

19:21.535 --> 19:23.786
IT WAS HIS IDEA!

19:26.623 --> 19:30.626
REMIND ME
TO KICK YOUR ASS.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.753
UH, HEY, RED.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.589
UM, UH,

19:34.756 --> 19:36.257
IS FORMAN AROUND?

19:36.425 --> 19:41.179
WELL, HE SURE AS HELL
IS NOT INSIDE THAT FRIDGE.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.315
MR. PINCIOTTI,
YOU'RE HOME.

19:52.482 --> 19:53.858
GOOD.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.027
UH, CAME BACK EARLY.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.945
AH, MISS THE KIDS
TOO MUCH.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.947
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

20:00.115 --> 20:02.867
OH, UH, I WAS JUST
COMING HOME FROM WORK,

20:03.035 --> 20:06.787
AND I NOTICED THAT SOMEONE
LEFT YOUR PORCH LIGHT ON.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.915
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE
THAT FROM YOUR HOUSE.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.625
GOOD EYE.

20:10.792 --> 20:11.876
THANK YOU.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.170
YOU KNOW, ERIC, THAT'S
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.421
I ASK YOU TO
LOOK OUT FOR DONNA,

20:15.589 --> 20:17.381
AND HERE YOU ARE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

20:17.549 --> 20:22.887
HANGING AROUND THE BACK DOOR
DOING YOUR JOB.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.180
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY, ERIC.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.225
I DON'T CARE WHAT
THEY SAY ABOUT YOU.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.392
HA! GOTCHA!

20:28.560 --> 20:30.478

20:54.294 --> 20:55.044
ERIC.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.255
DAD,
I'M QUITTING MY JOB.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.839
YOU'RE QUITTING?

20:59.007 --> 21:01.384
YEAH, I'M QUITTING.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.678
I'M IRRESPONSIBLE,
I'M A QUITTER,

21:03.845 --> 21:06.305
AND I COULDN'T KILL
A COW WITH A HAMMER.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.556
SO WHAT DO YOU
SAY TO THAT?

21:07.724 --> 21:09.433
WELL, EVERYBODY QUITS
THEIR FIRST JOB, ERIC.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.770
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.647
WHAT?

21:14.815 --> 21:17.483
THAT'S IT?

21:17.651 --> 21:20.236
I GOTTA SAY, DAD,
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED HERE.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.656
I MEAN, IT WASN'T
A MAN'S JOB ANYWAY.

21:23.824 --> 21:24.532
RED.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.575
WELL, COME ON, KITTY,
IT WAS A HAIR NET,

21:26.743 --> 21:31.872
NAMETAG, NOTHING
KIND OF A JOB.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.250
NOW, THAT'S
MORE LIKE IT.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.751
IT'S JUST AS WELL.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.837
IT WAS CUTTING INTO
YOUR CHORES ANYWAY.

21:38.005 --> 21:41.090
YOU DID A HALF-ASSED JOB
SWEEPING THE DRIVEWAY.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.636
I THOUGHT HE DID
A WONDERFUL JOB.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.139
DIDN'T LOOK
WONDERFUL TO ME.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.183
OK, THEN...

21:51.351 --> 21:54.395
SWEEP IT YOURSELF.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.816
HEY, HEY, HEY, FORMAN,

21:58.984 --> 22:03.863
WHERE'S THAT
BIG FATSO SMILE?

RICKY, HOW'D YOU START
WORKING AT FATSO BURGER?

22:05.949 --> 22:08.409
OH, GREAT STORY. I WAS
GONNA GO TO COLLEGE,

22:08.577 --> 22:09.827
BUT THEN THEY MADE ME
ASSISTANT MANAGER,

22:09.995 --> 22:12.204
JUST THREW THE MONEY AT ME,
SO I NEVER GOT TO GO.

22:12.372 --> 22:13.789
BUT NOW I'M MY OWN BOSS.

22:13.957 --> 22:16.917
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE,
I ANSWER TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.255
OK, I QUIT NOW.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.298
