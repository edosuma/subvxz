00:21.622 --> 00:23.465
I wonder whywe're
all assembled here today?

00:23.552 --> 00:25.478
I hope we're about to enter
the Hunger Games,

00:25.565 --> 00:26.630
'cause I'm starving.

00:26.718 --> 00:28.775
Maybe they're gonna tell us
this is all a joke.

00:28.863 --> 00:31.120
Who's ready
to have a little fun?

00:31.208 --> 00:33.217
When I say "announce,"
you say "ments."

00:33.312 --> 00:35.401
Announcements.
Aah, I messed that up.

00:35.488 --> 00:37.809
Anyway, here's your P.E.
instructor, Coach Blevins.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.742
This Friday,
every single student

00:39.830 --> 00:41.591
at Wagstaff
will be participating

00:41.679 --> 00:45.216
in our annual fourth througheighth
grade mandatory mile run.

00:45.294 --> 00:46.489
What-What's happening?

00:46.576 --> 00:47.667
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:47.755 --> 00:49.680
Every student is required to run

00:49.768 --> 00:51.686
unless you have
a real doctor's note,

00:51.774 --> 00:52.992
not a very convincing fake one

00:53.080 --> 00:55.557
that any intelligent person
would fall for.

00:55.645 --> 00:57.861
We'll be running
the same route as last year

00:57.949 --> 01:00.108
on the sidewalk outside
of school property.

01:00.196 --> 01:02.117
Teachers will be placed
around the route

01:02.244 --> 01:06.187
here, here, here and hereto
make sure you don't get lost

01:06.275 --> 01:08.830
or taken or something worse
I'm not thinking of.

01:08.918 --> 01:10.478
This dot on the map is me.

01:10.566 --> 01:12.822
But I'll be scooting about
on my adult scooter

01:12.910 --> 01:15.346
to inspire while you perspire.

01:15.434 --> 01:16.385
Okay.

01:16.473 --> 01:17.867
Now let's move on
to the booger wall.

01:17.954 --> 01:19.682
Mr. Branca is scraping
and painting today,

01:19.770 --> 01:21.358
so if you want a picture
of yourself with it

01:21.445 --> 01:23.482
or if you want to take any
of your boogers home,

01:23.570 --> 01:25.093
you have two hours.

01:25.314 --> 01:27.666
We have to run? A mile?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.385
And it's mandatory?!

01:29.473 --> 01:30.775
What a bunch of crap!

01:30.863 --> 01:32.728
Well, listen,
I can't run the mile!

01:32.856 --> 01:34.590
- Okay?
- If I run a mile, I will die!

01:34.678 --> 01:36.027
A mile is like five miles

01:36.184 --> 01:38.187
if I run a mile with these little legs!

01:38.274 --> 01:40.002
Tell me about it.

01:40.090 --> 01:41.767
- Okay, you want a hit?
- Nah, I'm good.

01:41.855 --> 01:43.103
I want to stay angry.

01:43.191 --> 01:45.358
Hey, Jimmy Jr.I was
thinking it could be cool

01:45.446 --> 01:46.901
if we ran the mile together
this year.

01:46.988 --> 01:48.846
W-Wait, you?

01:48.934 --> 01:50.849
- Run with me?
- Uh, yeah.

01:50.937 --> 01:52.558
- Doesn't that sound kind of fun?
- Sorry, Tina.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.814
But have you seen
how fast I run?

01:54.902 --> 01:57.955
I-I guess? Um, I just thought
it-it could be a nice way

01:58.043 --> 01:59.609
- to spend time...
- Well, I mean,

01:59.697 --> 02:01.713
I'm gonna try and break
nine minutes, so...

02:01.801 --> 02:03.349
I could just try to run
with you?

02:03.437 --> 02:05.900
Maybe we could hang out
after the mile when you finish

02:05.988 --> 02:07.555
and I've already been doing
something else

02:07.642 --> 02:09.079
for, like, two or three minutes.

02:09.167 --> 02:11.517
Okay, you know what, Jimmy Jr.?
I'm not gonna run with you.

02:11.605 --> 02:12.744
Yeah, I know, Tina.

02:12.832 --> 02:13.955
I'm gonna beat you.

02:14.043 --> 02:15.436
That's crazy.

02:15.561 --> 02:17.359
You better start training,
Jimmy Jr.,

02:17.447 --> 02:19.111
'cause Mama's comin' for you.

02:19.417 --> 02:21.658
I'm Mama in this scenario.

02:21.814 --> 02:23.406
So, how are we
getting out of itthis time?

02:23.493 --> 02:25.756
I don't know. I think
Coach Blevins finally realized.

02:25.844 --> 02:27.629
Dr. Good-doctor
isn't a real doctor.

02:27.717 --> 02:29.999
"Gene and Alex
both need constant contact

02:30.096 --> 02:33.403
"with their behinds on a surfaceto
realign their butt-cheeks.

02:33.491 --> 02:35.303
Love, Dr. Good-doctor."

02:35.391 --> 02:37.257
I can't run a whole mile
in a row.

02:37.383 --> 02:39.905
What do they think I am,
a car?

02:42.412 --> 02:43.655
It's on again.

02:43.743 --> 02:45.684
T <i>his weekend
at the Wharf Arts Center,</i>

02:45.772 --> 02:47.121
Cake is back.

02:47.217 --> 02:48.796
It's so beautiful.

02:48.884 --> 02:51.647
And this time, they're gonna
patty-cake your breath away.

02:52.147 --> 02:53.181
It did.

02:53.268 --> 02:54.843
It just caked my breath away.

02:54.931 --> 02:56.889
- Tickets on sale now.
- So, are you going?

02:56.977 --> 02:59.317
- I wish.
- Tickets are so expensive.

02:59.405 --> 03:00.468
How much could they be?

03:00.556 --> 03:01.750
I was just checking this morning

03:01.837 --> 03:03.544
on the Wharf Arts Center
website.

03:03.632 --> 03:05.106
- Here, look.
- Ooh.

03:05.194 --> 03:06.249
That is not cheap.

03:06.337 --> 03:07.991
Wait, look. It says this Friday,

03:08.079 --> 03:10.600
they're gonna releasediscounted
tickets at 11:00 a.m.

03:10.696 --> 03:11.804
You can get them over the phone.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.801
Oh, my God.
I-If we call right at 11:00,

03:13.889 --> 03:14.827
maybe we'll get lucky.

03:14.915 --> 03:16.975
We're great at calling places
at certain times.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.139
Like how I call Ginger
every day at 5:15,

03:19.227 --> 03:21.577
and she says, "Call me later,"
and then I forget.

03:21.905 --> 03:23.322
Stupid Jimmy Jr.

03:23.410 --> 03:24.882
Thinks I can't keep up with him.

03:24.970 --> 03:26.929
Well, at least
after we run the mile,

03:27.016 --> 03:29.630
we can all go get a free scoop
of ice cream.

03:29.718 --> 03:30.928
What are you talking about?

03:31.016 --> 03:33.820
Friday is free scoop day
at Moo's Clues.

03:33.908 --> 03:35.882
I've been saving up my money
for it for weeks.

03:35.970 --> 03:37.210
Just kidding. It's free,

03:37.298 --> 03:39.163
so I won't need any money.

03:39.251 --> 03:41.123
I've always wanted to go
to free scoop day.

03:41.211 --> 03:43.874
Don't even bother.
Let me paint a picture.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.741
Last year. Free scoop day.

03:45.829 --> 03:47.461
It was a beautiful afternoon,

03:47.548 --> 03:50.116
the perfect kind of afternoon
for eating...

03:50.204 --> 03:52.247
- Ice cream.
- Thank you, Courtney.

03:52.335 --> 03:53.654
Mm-hmm.
- But by the time

03:53.741 --> 03:55.897
school got out and we
arrived at Moo's Clues,

03:55.985 --> 03:57.529
the line was down the block.

03:57.617 --> 03:59.140
When we finally got
to the counter,

03:59.228 --> 04:00.991
the only flavor left was.

04:01.079 --> 04:03.178
Rum Raisin Sorbet.

04:03.266 --> 04:04.375
Dear Lord.

04:04.469 --> 04:07.281
No! Why?!

04:07.369 --> 04:09.428
The only way
I'd go to free scoop day

04:09.516 --> 04:11.328
would be to somehow go
during school,

04:11.416 --> 04:12.719
which is impossible.

04:12.807 --> 04:14.891
Wait, Gene.
That's a great idea.

04:14.979 --> 04:17.053
We could go during the mile.
We'd have no lines

04:17.141 --> 04:18.726
and all the flavors
to choose from.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.353
How would we go during the mile?

04:20.442 --> 04:22.328
I mean, Coach Blevins showed us
the map.

04:22.416 --> 04:24.229
This is school.
We start running the race

04:24.316 --> 04:25.406
with everyone else here.

04:25.494 --> 04:26.743
Not liking the plan so far.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.384
Shush, shush, shush.
The morning of the race,

04:28.471 --> 04:29.790
we could hide bikes
under the bushes

04:29.877 --> 04:31.574
where no teachers
are stationed here.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.795
Then, while all the other kids
are running this way,

04:34.326 --> 04:37.024
we'd just have to ride twoblocks
off route to Moo's Clues,

04:37.111 --> 04:39.460
eat our free ice cream,
get back, stash our bikes,

04:39.548 --> 04:41.565
blend in with the other
runners, and finish the mile.

04:41.652 --> 04:44.248
Oh, my God, I'm gonna pass out.
That's a great plan!

04:44.336 --> 04:46.892
Mm, I don't know if there's
enough time to do all of that.

04:46.955 --> 04:48.874
Yeah, last year,
some eighth grader ran it

04:48.962 --> 04:50.093
in, like, seven minutes.

04:50.181 --> 04:51.524
We can't do all that
in seven minutes.

04:51.611 --> 04:53.077
- That's cuckoo.
- No.

04:53.165 --> 04:55.163
We're gonna blend in
with the back of the pack.

04:55.251 --> 04:56.486
Who runs the slowest mile?

04:56.573 --> 04:59.070
I think Large Tommy ran it
in, like, 20 minutes.

04:59.158 --> 05:01.492
Oh, right, 'cause he had
to repeat the fourth grade.

05:01.580 --> 05:03.783
I get it. Pick a grade
you likeand stick with it.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.898
Okay, so,
we'll have about 20 minutes.

05:05.986 --> 05:07.554
It's tight,
but we could pull it off.

05:07.642 --> 05:08.837
Like my Spanx.

05:08.925 --> 05:10.812
All we have to do
is finish before he does.

05:10.900 --> 05:13.335
But what if Tommy runs it
faster this year?

05:13.423 --> 05:15.515
Well, we could... track him.

05:15.603 --> 05:17.640
Okay.
We'll use the trackers we got

05:17.728 --> 05:19.485
- when we were in the CIA.
- No, no, no.

05:19.573 --> 05:21.915
My dad bought our cat
a GPS collar

05:22.003 --> 05:23.194
so he could keep track of her.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.189
That little happy cat is Susan.

05:25.277 --> 05:26.827
- Aw.
- If we could somehow put

05:26.915 --> 05:28.668
the collar on Large Tommy,

05:28.756 --> 05:31.411
then we'd know exactly whenwe'd
need to finish the race by.

05:31.501 --> 05:33.509
Wow. Courtney, I'm impressed.

05:33.597 --> 05:36.220
Guys, this plan sounds
a little risky.

05:36.372 --> 05:38.429
Well, there's no way
I could run a whole mile.

05:38.517 --> 05:41.812
So I say we take the risk
and we do the ice cream plan.

05:41.899 --> 05:43.212
All right, we're doing this.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.780
Tina, are you in?
You want ice cream?

05:44.868 --> 05:45.948
No ice cream for me.

05:46.036 --> 05:47.427
I'm just gonna have
a double scoop

05:47.514 --> 05:49.658
of beating Jimmy Jr.'s ass
into the asphalt.

05:49.746 --> 05:50.876
Suit yourself, sis.

05:50.964 --> 05:53.242
'Kay, Friday morning,
we all leave for school early,

05:53.330 --> 05:54.650
we hide our bikes,
and then we eat

05:54.738 --> 05:57.028
any flavor of free ice cream
we choose.

05:57.116 --> 05:59.937
And if we have time, we take
allof the Rum Raisin Sorbet

06:00.025 --> 06:01.601
out of that store and burn it.

06:01.689 --> 06:04.869
- Uh, I like Rum Raisin Sorbet, actually.
- Rudy!

06:08.610 --> 06:11.102
Get some rest, phone.
You have a big day tomorrow.

06:11.189 --> 06:12.415
You're gonna get us tickets

06:12.502 --> 06:14.337
to see Cake Two:
Cake My Breath Away.

06:14.425 --> 06:16.123
Don't worry, I got this, Bob.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.486
I know you do, B.P.

06:17.573 --> 06:18.673
What's B.P.?

06:18.761 --> 06:20.330
"Bob's phone." Your nickname.

06:20.417 --> 06:21.587
- Do you love it?
- No.

06:21.675 --> 06:23.696
- What do you want to be named?
- Phil.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.946
Stop talking to your phone, Bob.
Go to sleep.

06:26.034 --> 06:29.024
One second. You're so old,
but I believe in you.

06:29.112 --> 06:31.353
- Bob, go to sleep!
- Okay. I love you.

06:31.504 --> 06:33.095
Are you talking to me
or to your phone?

06:33.183 --> 06:34.946
Uh, y-you...?

06:35.302 --> 06:37.290
You're lookin' good on
that big-girl bike, Louise.

06:37.378 --> 06:38.413
Thank you.

06:38.501 --> 06:40.522
I mean, I'm being nice.
But good effort.

06:40.610 --> 06:41.899
All right, we're here.

06:41.987 --> 06:44.384
Ah, dang. I tried to skid out,
but it didn't work.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.819
Man, that would have been
cool.

06:45.907 --> 06:48.024
Ah, ring, ring. I'm here.

06:48.112 --> 06:50.071
Hey, Courtney. You don't have
to say "ring, ring"

06:50.159 --> 06:51.212
and ring your bell.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.634
I also don't have
to say "tinkle"

06:52.722 --> 06:54.142
when I'm tinkling,
but I do.

06:54.230 --> 06:56.711
Oh, my God. All right,
let's stash our bikes.

06:56.799 --> 06:57.821
How's everybody feeling?

06:57.909 --> 06:59.259
- Pumped.
- So good.

06:59.347 --> 07:01.813
- Scared.
- Alex, you have to bury that fear.

07:01.901 --> 07:03.876
One slipup, and you could
endanger the mission.

07:03.964 --> 07:06.071
We live by the cone
or we die by the cone!

07:06.159 --> 07:07.636
I think they also have cups.

07:07.724 --> 07:10.422
- So, are we cool?
- Yeah.

07:10.510 --> 07:12.384
- Now, give me a hug.
- On it.

07:12.472 --> 07:14.111
Wait, a quick one or, like,
uh, what are we doing?

07:14.198 --> 07:15.936
Hug me like you got lost
at an amusement park,

07:16.023 --> 07:18.069
and you just found your mommy.

07:18.157 --> 07:20.289
- I'll do a hug.
- Get in here, girl!

07:20.377 --> 07:22.336
- Aw...
- I want a hug.

07:22.424 --> 07:23.773
Bring it in, Rudy.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.151
You're really
missin' out, Louise.

07:25.238 --> 07:27.392
Oh, no, I'm-I'm not.

07:28.276 --> 07:30.365
Good morning, Wagstaffians.

07:30.453 --> 07:32.543
In a minute, you will begin...-Oh,
crap, I forgot my hard hat.

07:32.630 --> 07:34.240
Why do you need a hard hat?

07:34.328 --> 07:35.931
'Cause I'm gonna demolish you.

07:36.019 --> 07:37.508
All right, Courtney,
give me the tracker.

07:37.595 --> 07:38.251
Here you go.

07:38.339 --> 07:40.618
Geez, I hope Susan doesn't
pick today to run away.

07:40.714 --> 07:42.368
That'd be terrible timing
on her part.

07:42.456 --> 07:43.994
You don't think she'll
run away, do you?

07:44.081 --> 07:45.781
Susan? No.

07:45.869 --> 07:47.915
Guys, look.
Tommy has a hydration pack.

07:48.003 --> 07:49.482
We can hide the cat collar
in there.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.532
I say we stick
with the original plan

07:51.620 --> 07:53.337
and tell him it's a cool anklet.

07:53.425 --> 07:55.298
Gene, no. I'm moving in.

07:58.681 --> 08:00.074
- What's up?
- Uh, nothing.

08:00.162 --> 08:02.599
Your backpack is unzipped.
There ya go.

08:02.687 --> 08:04.558
What do you, uh,
have to drink back there?

08:04.646 --> 08:07.040
Water. Actually, it's milk.

08:07.133 --> 08:09.266
Done. Courtney,
do we have a signal?

08:09.384 --> 08:10.646
- Check.
- All right.

08:10.734 --> 08:12.302
Now we just have to
get to the finish line

08:12.389 --> 08:14.304
before that happy little
cat face does.

08:14.392 --> 08:16.259
Hi, Teddy!

08:16.347 --> 08:18.523
We're about to call and try
to get tickets for Cake.

08:18.611 --> 08:20.265
Hey, I could help.
I got a phone.

08:20.353 --> 08:21.501
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Teddy.

08:21.589 --> 08:22.853
That's what best friends
are for.

08:22.940 --> 08:24.764
Uh, let's-let's see if you
get through.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.634
Okay, we have one minute
till the lines open.

08:26.722 --> 08:28.491
This is the number for
the Wharf Arts Center.

08:28.579 --> 08:29.805
- How-How's your battery?
- Great.

08:29.892 --> 08:31.337
I got a mighty 23%.

08:31.433 --> 08:34.743
Huh, that's not...
Crap, it's time. Dial. Dial!

08:34.854 --> 08:37.205
Wait, I can't read your writing.
Is that an eight or a boob?

08:37.292 --> 08:39.142
That's an eight, Lin.
Why would it be a boob?

08:39.230 --> 08:40.572
Ju-Just dial.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.392
On your mark. Get set...

08:43.480 --> 08:45.126
Go! Go! Go!

08:45.214 --> 08:46.998
Go! Run. Come on.

08:47.103 --> 08:50.845
See ya later, Tina-gator!

08:50.933 --> 08:54.861
Hmm. I might've started
a little too hot.

08:54.949 --> 08:58.915
It's hard to talk and run.
Stop making me talk, Tina!

08:59.110 --> 09:01.408
Oh, my God. Jimmy Jr.
Is a terrible runner.

09:01.496 --> 09:03.056
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

09:03.144 --> 09:05.102
All right, we just have to
make it to the bushes.

09:05.189 --> 09:07.931
This already feels like
a lot of running.

09:08.019 --> 09:09.986
Just use your thing already,
Rudy.

09:10.081 --> 09:12.353
You mean my booster rocket?

09:12.441 --> 09:14.868
Blastoff.

09:17.778 --> 09:19.650
Hello? Hi. Is anyone there?

09:19.743 --> 09:22.267
No. Just the hold recording
started over.

09:22.355 --> 09:23.945
I know, I keep
thinking a real person

09:24.033 --> 09:25.088
is picking up.

09:25.175 --> 09:27.613
Hi. Welcome to Bob's Burgers.
What-what can I get you?

09:27.701 --> 09:29.355
Yeah, I'll take
a burger of the day.

09:29.443 --> 09:32.315
Oh, wait, hold on. Hello?
Oh, still on hold.

09:32.412 --> 09:34.893
- Uh, what can I get you?
- A burger of the day.

09:34.981 --> 09:38.390
Whoa, whoa, wait, hold on.
Hello? Oh. Still on hold.

09:38.478 --> 09:39.528
Uh, sorry. Wha-What can I...

09:39.615 --> 09:40.646
I'm sorry, is there someone

09:40.733 --> 09:41.940
else who could take
my order, maybe?

09:42.027 --> 09:43.814
Hi. I can help you.
What would you like?

09:43.902 --> 09:45.315
Yeah, I'll have a burger
of...-Wait, hold on.

09:45.402 --> 09:47.236
- Oh, my God.
- Hello? Still on hold.

09:47.324 --> 09:49.587
- What can I get ya?
- You know what? I-I'll come back.

09:49.712 --> 09:50.987
What's the matter?
You're not hungry?

09:51.074 --> 09:52.478
What's that guy's problem?

09:52.585 --> 09:55.353
Just give up now, Tina!

09:55.441 --> 09:57.276
Wow. I actually
feel kind of bad for him.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.681
Maybe I should let him win.

09:58.769 --> 10:00.642
Ah, screw it.
I'm gonna take him.

10:00.845 --> 10:04.118
Ha! You're only in front of me
'cause I let you be.

10:04.206 --> 10:06.382
Okay, I really got to
stop talking.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.283
Guys, we're here.

10:10.814 --> 10:12.783
Once he gets a little further
out of sight,

10:12.871 --> 10:14.004
we'll grab our bikes and ride.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.111
And then we'll grab our
ice cream and licky, licky,

10:16.199 --> 10:17.626
- licky, licky, licky.
- All right,

10:17.714 --> 10:18.970
let's move!

10:19.188 --> 10:21.564
I can already taste the
ice cream, and also my sweat.

10:21.652 --> 10:23.642
I really hope my cat doesn't
run away today.

10:23.769 --> 10:25.517
What is going on with you?

10:25.604 --> 10:28.563
No. No! Guys, wait! Wait!

10:28.651 --> 10:29.637
I can still catch them.

10:29.725 --> 10:32.481
I just have toput my
bike chain back on. Aah!

10:32.585 --> 10:35.512
No, they're getting away!
Stay calm. Stay calm.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.123
Crap, I have to hide my bike.

10:37.218 --> 10:38.828
Uh, maybe he won't notice me.

10:38.916 --> 10:41.153
Gene Belcher!
What are you doing?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.807
I'm just running slowly
by myself.

10:43.895 --> 10:45.201
Nothing suspicious!

10:45.289 --> 10:47.422
You're a little off course.
Come back this way.

10:47.602 --> 10:49.436
Oh, no. We lost Gene.

10:49.524 --> 10:50.764
He's gonna die out there.

10:50.852 --> 10:51.940
Oh, God. Ugh!

10:52.028 --> 10:53.596
I can't believe
I actually have to do this.

10:53.683 --> 10:56.233
Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
give me strength!

10:56.321 --> 10:58.022
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

11:02.263 --> 11:03.609
You can do it!

11:03.696 --> 11:05.819
You just have three-quarters
of a mile left!

11:05.907 --> 11:08.334
Which is a lot,
but don't think about that.

11:08.422 --> 11:10.401
We can't just leave him
out there, we're not animals.

11:10.488 --> 11:12.481
Guys, Tommy just made
the first turn.

11:12.569 --> 11:13.274
Damn it!

11:13.361 --> 11:14.841
We have to keep moving.

11:14.928 --> 11:16.475
If we go back,
nobody gets ice cream.

11:16.571 --> 11:18.834
If we go forward,
we get ice cream.

11:18.922 --> 11:20.920
I say we go forward.
For Gene.

11:21.008 --> 11:22.512
No, how-how is that for Gene?

11:22.600 --> 11:24.285
It's what he
would have wanted, Rudy.

11:24.373 --> 11:26.286
I say we keep going. For Gene.

11:26.374 --> 11:28.637
I also want ice cream. For Gene.

11:28.724 --> 11:30.160
- For Gene!
- For Gene.

11:30.247 --> 11:31.856
I feel like we're not doing it
for Gene,

11:31.944 --> 11:33.381
- but if...
- We're doing it for Gene!

11:33.468 --> 11:34.600
Okay. Fine.

11:34.687 --> 11:36.373
Just because
you're in last place

11:36.461 --> 11:38.593
doesn't mean you're slower
than everyone else.

11:38.908 --> 11:40.867
And now that I've inspired you,

11:40.954 --> 11:43.304
I'm gonna scoot to the
finish line athletically.

11:43.723 --> 11:46.394
No shame in taking
a break to walk, Tina.

11:46.481 --> 11:48.544
Why don't you come up here
and tell me that, Slow Stuff.

11:48.631 --> 11:51.938
I don't... want to.

11:53.652 --> 11:55.074
Hey, hey. Mine's ringing.

11:55.193 --> 11:56.512
Hello? Can you hear me?

11:56.600 --> 11:58.298
I-I think we got
a bad connection.

11:58.386 --> 12:00.387
Teddy, go by the window.
That's the good spot.

12:00.475 --> 12:02.391
- Hello? No, it's worse here.
- Oh, my God, Teddy.

12:02.478 --> 12:03.740
Don't let the call drop.

12:03.828 --> 12:05.153
- Uh, go to higher ground.
- O-Okay.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.590
- Stand on a booth.
- It's a little better.

12:06.677 --> 12:07.957
Wait, no, I-I'm gonna go higher.

12:08.285 --> 12:09.750
Why did you pick a booth
with a customer?

12:09.837 --> 12:11.882
I don't know. Uh, sorry, ma'am.
Keep eating.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.721
Uh, hi. Hi. Can you hear me?
Great. Hi.

12:14.885 --> 12:16.828
What show am I calling about?
What show am I call...?

12:16.915 --> 12:19.004
- Cake, Teddy. It's called Cake!
- Cake.

12:19.232 --> 12:21.515
Sure, I'd be interestedin
hearing about all your shows

12:21.603 --> 12:23.094
in the upcoming
Wharf Arts Center season.

12:23.181 --> 12:24.971
- The-the tickets, Teddy.
- Wow.

12:25.059 --> 12:26.409
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, huh?

12:26.520 --> 12:27.783
How do they get the cat
to do that?

12:27.870 --> 12:29.524
Get the tickets, Teddy.

12:29.612 --> 12:31.850
All right. No,
he just wants to see Cake.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.530
Do you still have
discounted tickets?

12:33.618 --> 12:35.098
You do? That's great.

12:35.186 --> 12:37.270
Okay, so let me get two
of those, please.

12:37.358 --> 12:39.691
Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh, no.

12:39.779 --> 12:42.564
- What happened?
- Eh, my phone just ran out of batteries.

12:42.652 --> 12:44.839
What the heck?
I was at three percent

12:44.927 --> 12:46.073
when I started the call.

12:46.161 --> 12:47.917
Oh, my God, Teddy.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.063
We made it.
We actually made it.

12:52.151 --> 12:54.763
- Today I become a man.
- Every flavor.

12:54.851 --> 12:56.766
There's no line
and they have every flavor.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.286
Whoa, they have vanilla.

12:59.374 --> 13:01.333
Hello... Vanessa.

13:01.421 --> 13:03.637
Uh, I'll have your largest
and free-est scoop

13:03.725 --> 13:05.567
of Ripple Fudge
Caramel Delight, please.

13:05.655 --> 13:08.092
And could you throw in a scoop
of Raspberry Rumble on top?

13:08.180 --> 13:09.184
Also for free.

13:09.272 --> 13:11.098
You get one scoop.
Standard size.

13:11.186 --> 13:13.122
Don't come back.
I'll recognize you.

13:13.217 --> 13:15.838
I'll recognize all of you,
got it?

13:15.926 --> 13:17.964
Yup. Got it.
One scoop, sounds great.

13:18.051 --> 13:19.625
Ah!

13:19.713 --> 13:20.791
Sorry, I didn't see you.

13:20.879 --> 13:22.961
I-I'm just gonna take
a little break real quick.

13:23.049 --> 13:25.798
- No. You can't stop.
- What? Why?

13:25.885 --> 13:27.385
It hurts so bad
if you stop moving.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.127
It's like your bones
turn into nails

13:29.215 --> 13:31.306
and your blood turns into
pain.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.314
Oh, God. And my shoe's untied.

13:33.402 --> 13:35.142
- Don't stop.
- Eh, fine.

13:35.285 --> 13:36.689
Let me get a sip of that...

13:36.951 --> 13:38.170
Mmm, milk.

13:38.258 --> 13:39.850
Had enough yet, Tina?

13:39.938 --> 13:42.471
The back of your head
looks exhausted.

13:42.559 --> 13:44.730
Hey, Jimmy Jr., maybe less
running your mouth

13:44.830 --> 13:46.160
and more running your feet,
huh?

13:46.248 --> 13:48.010
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

13:48.098 --> 13:50.160
- Hello. Hi.
- Did you get through?

13:50.248 --> 13:53.300
Yes. I'm calling for the discounted
tickets for Cake Two.

13:53.388 --> 13:55.738
Oh. Okay. Crap.

13:55.829 --> 13:58.960
I'm sorry, Bobby.
They just sold the last two.

14:01.161 --> 14:02.542
Eh... Oh, well.

14:02.630 --> 14:05.698
There's nothing any of us
could have done.

14:06.017 --> 14:08.100
- You.
- What, me?

14:08.463 --> 14:10.151
- You.
- All right.

14:10.239 --> 14:12.371
Uh, Teddy, it was good
to see you. Time to go, hon.

14:12.459 --> 14:14.268
We had the tickets!
We had them!

14:14.356 --> 14:15.722
Are you saying
this is my fault?!

14:15.810 --> 14:18.143
Yes! Who doesn't charge
their phone, Teddy?!

14:18.231 --> 14:20.808
I did! It only charges to 23%.

14:20.896 --> 14:22.550
Then bring a charger,
you idiot!

14:22.638 --> 14:25.149
Okay, calm down, fellas.
It's just a show.

14:25.237 --> 14:27.839
Middle of the day
and your phone's at 23%?

14:27.927 --> 14:29.753
- Bob... stop.
- What am I supposed to do?

14:29.842 --> 14:32.254
- Replace my phone every ten years?
- Yes!

14:32.342 --> 14:34.344
Do me a favor and don't
tell mehow to live my life!

14:34.431 --> 14:36.034
I'm-I'm-I'm leaving.

14:36.122 --> 14:37.559
- Good! Great!
- Yeah, I'm leaving.

14:37.647 --> 14:38.832
- That's great, leave!
- I'm leaving.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.042
I hope your car isn't out
of batteries.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.349
Yeah, cars don't
have batteries, idiot.

14:43.437 --> 14:45.701
They run on gas. And batteries.

14:45.789 --> 14:47.456
Damn it.

14:48.097 --> 14:49.298
Eat faster, people.

14:49.386 --> 14:50.613
I mean, savor it
but speed it up.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.909
Oh! Pushin' through
the brain freeze.

14:52.998 --> 14:55.415
Licky, licky, licky,
licky, licky.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.298
- Like Gene said. You remember?
- Yeah.

14:57.386 --> 14:58.762
- Licky, licky, licky, licky.
- Man, this just doesn't feel

14:58.849 --> 14:59.612
- that great without him.
- Licky, licky,

14:59.700 --> 15:01.238
- Also, Courtney, stop doing that.
- Licky, licky. Ugh.

15:01.325 --> 15:03.023
I feel mostly fine,

15:03.111 --> 15:05.620
but, ugh, I see your point.
Hang on.

15:05.708 --> 15:07.319
Everybody, stop eating. Stop!

15:07.407 --> 15:09.143
We left Gene behind
but that doesn't mean

15:09.286 --> 15:11.245
we have to leave
his free scoop behind.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.667
She's not gonna give us
another scoop, Louise.

15:13.755 --> 15:16.534
That's right. But we
can give him our scoops.

15:16.653 --> 15:18.220
What are you talking about?

15:18.308 --> 15:20.839
Quick, come put whatever you
haven't eaten into my cone.

15:20.927 --> 15:23.060
We're bringing Gene back
a scoop of our leftovers.

15:23.148 --> 15:26.180
Well, I guess Gene needs it
more than I do. Fine.

15:26.268 --> 15:29.008
That's the spirit. Now
plop it on in here, people.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.792
- Wait, wait, guys.
- What?

15:30.880 --> 15:32.708
Tommy only has
a couple blocks left.

15:32.796 --> 15:34.015
Crap. Let's move.

15:34.103 --> 15:36.206
The faster we go,
the faster we get there.

15:36.294 --> 15:38.884
I'm in no mood
for your elaborate riddles.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.165
I can't believe
you've done this before.

15:41.253 --> 15:42.784
I mean, they make us do it,

15:42.872 --> 15:44.482
but it does feel
really good to finish.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.604
Tommy,
you inspirational bastard.

15:47.829 --> 15:50.701
I'm riding with one hand.
I'm riding with one hand!

15:50.812 --> 15:53.571
Someone's fishing for a compliment.
Good job, Louise.

15:53.659 --> 15:55.563
- Look, I see them.
- Gene!

15:55.651 --> 15:57.011
Gene, we're back.

15:57.099 --> 15:58.673
Look at me. I'm running!

15:58.761 --> 16:00.048
And I think I have a chance

16:00.136 --> 16:02.737
- of finishing this thing!
- We brought you a scoop.

16:02.824 --> 16:05.044
Just stop so we can stash
our bikes and hand it to you.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.347
I can't stop!

16:06.440 --> 16:08.003
Well, I'm gonna
fall off my bike.

16:08.090 --> 16:11.093
I'm riding with one
freakin' hand, just take it!

16:11.180 --> 16:14.300
Fine! Ugh, I really want
to stop and eat this,

16:14.388 --> 16:16.303
but I'm gonna keep running.

16:16.391 --> 16:19.742
- Susan! Susan,
where are you, sweetie? Susan!

16:19.830 --> 16:22.962
Oh, no. Guys, it's my dad.
He has the cat tracker

16:23.050 --> 16:24.448
- on his phone, too.
- What?

16:24.536 --> 16:26.134
Courtney, it's Susan.

16:26.222 --> 16:28.032
I'm desperately seeking Susan.

16:28.128 --> 16:30.925
I followed the tracker here.
W-Wait, why are you on a bike?

16:31.013 --> 16:33.363
Susan's fine, Daddy.
Just go home.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.587
I will not go home.
Susan is close.

16:35.675 --> 16:37.683
Wait, she's moving further away.

16:37.771 --> 16:39.206
Very slowly?

16:39.339 --> 16:42.026
Is she in that boy's backpack?

16:42.168 --> 16:45.258
Gene and Gene's friend,
stop right now.

16:45.345 --> 16:48.043
- He made us stop running.
- Ow!

16:48.130 --> 16:50.253
I can't feel my bones,
but it hurts!

16:50.341 --> 16:51.960
Daddy, what did you do to them?

16:52.047 --> 16:54.396
Nothing, but I'm going to open
this one's pack.

16:54.484 --> 16:56.050
Susan, Daddy's here.

16:56.138 --> 16:58.277
What is going on?
Why-why are you on bikes?

16:58.365 --> 17:01.056
Gene Belcher, where did
you get that ice cream cone?

17:01.143 --> 17:04.059
- Uh...
- Wait, what the heck?

17:04.146 --> 17:07.148
- I need to find Susan.
- Who is Susan?

17:07.236 --> 17:09.404
- My cat!
- Oh, God, no.

17:12.820 --> 17:16.069
Gene, you need to stand upand
stop eating that ice cream.

17:16.236 --> 17:19.074
- I wasn't eating it, and I can't get up.
- Why not?

17:19.161 --> 17:21.424
Because I can't feel my legs
because I was running.

17:21.511 --> 17:23.165
I was actually running.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.171
Someone needs to explain
what's going on here.

17:26.259 --> 17:28.986
Courtney, you need
to speak up right now.

17:29.074 --> 17:31.288
Daddy, Susan is fine.
She's at home.

17:31.376 --> 17:33.088
I just borrowed her collar
for something.

17:33.175 --> 17:34.587
Oh, good. Oh, boy.

17:34.675 --> 17:36.579
So Mr. Wheeler's cat
has been located.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.220
Now would anyone like to explain

17:38.308 --> 17:41.126
just what's going on
with this whole situation?

17:41.270 --> 17:43.343
Tina, I'm sorry, okay?

17:43.431 --> 17:45.804
I should have just run with you.

17:45.892 --> 17:47.468
I-I got too competitive.

17:47.556 --> 17:49.322
Yeah, you were a jerk about it.

17:49.409 --> 17:52.151
Well, if it's not too late,
I-I'd like to...

17:52.238 --> 17:53.939
- Kiss?
- What? No.

17:54.027 --> 17:55.907
Run the rest
of the mile with you.

17:55.995 --> 17:58.790
That sounds nice.
All right, I'm slowing down.

17:58.961 --> 18:02.051
Uh, yeah.
Like I said, I'm sorry.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.634
Wait, are you speeding up?

18:04.722 --> 18:06.808
- No.
- Yeah, you are. Stop it.

18:06.896 --> 18:09.080
- You're speeding up.
- I'm not speeding up.

18:09.168 --> 18:11.513
Are you still trying to beat me?

18:11.601 --> 18:15.914
No! No, you must be slowing
down because you're tired.

18:18.618 --> 18:19.791
Yes!

18:19.879 --> 18:21.887
Ah, dang it!

18:21.975 --> 18:24.639
- You made me do that, Jimmy Jr.
- I'm sorry.

18:24.727 --> 18:27.164
- I don't forgive you.
- I hurt so much.

18:27.316 --> 18:29.457
I got to stretch out
my quads and hammies.

18:29.545 --> 18:31.190
Okay, I forgive you.
I'll stretch you out.

18:31.386 --> 18:33.127
Glutes, too.
Let's start with those.

18:33.271 --> 18:34.410
Since no one will talk,

18:34.497 --> 18:36.803
you will all be
redoing the mile tomorrow.

18:36.891 --> 18:38.519
After I check
with Principal Spoors

18:38.607 --> 18:40.139
to confirm I have
that authority.

18:40.227 --> 18:42.026
Well, guys, we had a good run.

18:42.114 --> 18:44.644
I mean, we didn't actually
run, but you know what I mean.

18:44.732 --> 18:45.920
We almost pulled it off.

18:46.008 --> 18:48.490
We'll do the stupid mile.

18:48.578 --> 18:50.301
I know. You don't have a choice.

18:50.389 --> 18:52.115
I'm telling you you're doing it.

18:52.203 --> 18:53.944
But Gene shouldn't have to.

18:54.032 --> 18:55.701
That guy ran his butt off today.

18:55.789 --> 18:57.240
Wait, where is Gene?

18:57.357 --> 18:59.218
Oh, look. He's doing it.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.342
- Gene! Whoa.
- He's actually doing it.

19:01.430 --> 19:03.737
Got to finish, got to finish.

19:04.003 --> 19:04.960
Gene, get back here!

19:05.048 --> 19:07.485
You'll have to catch me,
Mr. Frond!

19:07.573 --> 19:11.186
Gonna finish! Gonna finish!
Gonna finish!

19:11.301 --> 19:12.955
I did it! I did it!

19:13.145 --> 19:15.712
I just ran a freakin' mile!
Tommy, we did it!

19:15.799 --> 19:17.574
No, Gene, wedid it.

19:17.688 --> 19:19.690
- That's what I said.
- Oh.

19:19.778 --> 19:22.223
Okay, fine, Gene doesn't
have to run tomorrow.

19:22.371 --> 19:24.020
But everyone else does.

19:24.108 --> 19:26.807
Again, if I have the authority
to make you do that.

19:26.895 --> 19:28.319
And now I'm gonna
eat this scoop.

19:28.407 --> 19:30.793
It was not free. I earned this.

19:30.941 --> 19:32.773
Licky, licky, licky,
licky, licky.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.145
Whoa! What flavor is this?

19:36.505 --> 19:38.838
Cheer up, Bobby. Maybe we
can gosee something else

19:38.926 --> 19:40.199
at the Wharf Arts Center.

19:40.389 --> 19:42.035
I-It's okay. I-I'll be fine.

19:42.123 --> 19:44.105
I-I might have gotten
a little worked up, huh?

19:45.339 --> 19:47.832
Uh, I've been sitting
in my truck outside.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.033
Yeah. Well, look,
I just want to say.

19:50.121 --> 19:51.790
I-I'm sorry I got upset at you.

19:51.878 --> 19:54.652
- I-I just really wanted to see...
- No, no, no, no, no.

19:54.808 --> 19:56.613
Eh. Go on, what were you saying?

19:56.701 --> 19:58.767
I was about... I was
in the middle of apologizing,

19:58.855 --> 20:00.801
- but you cut me off.
- No. W-What? You go ahead.

20:00.888 --> 20:02.934
- I-I didn't mean to...
- No, I know I can go ahead...

20:03.021 --> 20:04.316
No, go ahead and you apologize.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.723
So now you're telling me
to go ahead,

20:05.810 --> 20:06.681
- because I was in the...
- No, just go ahead.

20:06.769 --> 20:08.010
- You wanted to say something...
- You can't even

20:08.097 --> 20:09.244
let someone apologize!

20:09.331 --> 20:10.566
Get out, Teddy!
Go back in your truck!

20:10.653 --> 20:12.050
You know what, that's great.
That's great.

20:12.137 --> 20:13.807
That's the way
this day should end.

20:13.895 --> 20:16.172
Wait, Teddy, stop.
I-I'm sorry.

20:16.260 --> 20:18.094
I'm just a little
worked up, still.

20:18.182 --> 20:19.472
Yeah, well, it turns out

20:19.559 --> 20:22.190
- I had a phone charger in my truck.
- That's great.

20:22.278 --> 20:24.199
And I had a voice mail
from the Wharf Arts Center.

20:24.286 --> 20:25.049
You did?

20:25.137 --> 20:27.140
Yeah. They called back
with caller I.D. and they said

20:27.227 --> 20:29.494
they set aside two tickets
to Cake for you.

20:29.582 --> 20:31.309
- What? That's incredible.
- Yep.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.462
They said I just had to call
back in the next five minutes.

20:33.549 --> 20:35.674
- Did-did you call back?
- I wanted to tell you first.

20:35.762 --> 20:38.026
- Teddy, please call back!
- Right. No, yeah.

20:38.143 --> 20:39.492
Right now. Right.
I'll call back.

20:39.579 --> 20:42.838
Hello. Yes, this is Teddy,
the one that you called.

20:42.926 --> 20:46.002
Right. Yes, that's my...
Yep, you called me. Right.

20:46.107 --> 20:47.696
How are you doing? Eh.

20:47.784 --> 20:49.516
Hey, I got to ask,
what is that accent?

20:49.604 --> 20:51.164
Is it Jamaican, or Scottish?

20:51.252 --> 20:52.287
- Teddy.
- Ted-Teddy.

20:52.374 --> 20:54.724
Hey, I should probably
just get those tickets.

20:54.811 --> 20:57.686
So, if I could go...
Hello? Hello?

20:57.827 --> 21:00.733
Hello? Bobby, can I borrow
your phone real quick?
