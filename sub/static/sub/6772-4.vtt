00:02.000 --> 00:04.923
Applejack: Boy, howdy. I got my work cut out for me.

00:04.923 --> 00:09.009
That there's the biggest bumper crop o'apples I ever laid eyes on.

00:09.009 --> 00:14.118
Big Macintosh: Ee-yup. Too big for you t'handle on yer own.

00:14.118 --> 00:17.647
Applejack: Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better.

00:17.647 --> 00:20.526
I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle.
(jabs Big Mac)

00:20.526 --> 00:22.245
Oops! Sorry...

00:22.245 --> 00:24.892
I'll take a bite outta this job by day's end.

00:24.892 --> 00:28.700
Big Mac: Biting off more than you can 
 chew is just what I'm afraid of.

00:28.007 --> 00:32.073
Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?

00:32.073 --> 00:33.855
Yup.

00:33.855 --> 00:38.081
Why, of all the- This is your sister Applejack, remember?!

00:38.081 --> 00:41.285
(raising voice) The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?

00:41.285 --> 00:43.746
But still only ONE pony.

00:43.746 --> 00:48.483
And ONE pony plus HUNDREDS o'apple trees just doesn't add up.

00:48.483 --> 00:51.455
Don't you use yer fancy "mathematics" to muddy the issue!

00:51.455 --> 00:54.985
I said I can handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to you.

00:54.985 --> 01:01.486
I'm gonna get every last apple out of those 
 trees this applebuck season all by myself.

01:03.553 --> 01:04.575
(gulps)

01:07.222 --> 01:13.305
(theme song begins) My Little Pony, My Little Pony, ah, ah, ah, ah,

01:13.305 --> 01:17.717
(My Little Pony) Twilight: I used to wonder what friendship could be

01:17.717 --> 01:21.711
(My Little Pony) Until you all shared its magic with me

01:21.711 --> 01:24.033
Rainbow Dash: Big adventure
Pinkie Pie: Tons of fun

01:24.033 --> 01:26.123
Rarity: A beautiful heart
Applejack: Faithful and strong

01:26.123 --> 01:28.166
Fluttershy: Sharing kindness
Twilight: It's an easy feat

01:28.166 --> 01:30.442
All: And magic makes it all complete, yeah

01:30.442 --> 01:38.940
(My Little Pony) Do you know you're all my very best friends

01:43.561 --> 01:45.093
Well, I better get kickin'.

01:45.929 --> 01:48.048
These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees.

01:48.484 --> 01:51.036
(low rumbling, apple thuds)
Hey!

01:51.363 --> 01:52.071
(ground rumbling)
Oh no!

02:00.558 --> 02:03.030
STAMPEEEEEEDE!

02:03.298 --> 02:08.041
(cows mooing, ground being trampled)

02:08.406 --> 02:13.075
(ponies panicking, doors slamming shut)

02:13.075 --> 02:21.046
Pinkie Pie: (laughing, voice trembling with ground) He-e-ey! Thi-i-is ma-a-akes my-y-y-y voi-i-ice so-o-ound silly-y-y!

02:21.456 --> 02:24.010
Pinkie Pie! Are you crazy?! Run!

02:24.766 --> 02:28.033
Everypony calm down. There is no reason to panic!

02:28.329 --> 02:30.060
Rarity: But mayor! Whatever shall we do?!

02:30.605 --> 02:31.077
Rainbow Dash: Look there!

02:31.766 --> 02:34.018
(ground shaking underfoot)

02:34.018 --> 02:36.027
Applejack: YEE-HAW!

02:36.027 --> 02:38.078
(cheering)

02:38.778 --> 02:41.075
Move aside, Winona. (Winona barking)

02:41.075 --> 02:43.047
Applejack: Herd'em up, girl!

02:43.979 --> 02:45.019
(Winona barking)

02:45.187 --> 02:49.013
(Rarity moans)
Pinkie Pie: This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen!

02:54.498 --> 02:55.089
Come on, little doggie!

02:55.891 --> 02:57.001
Herd!

02:57.006 --> 03:00.007
Applejack: (whistles) Winona, put'em up.

03:00.071 --> 03:03.037
(Winona barks)

03:03.368 --> 03:05.064
Applejack: Ha HA! That's it!

03:05.644 --> 03:07.092
(rope twirling, Applejack grunting)

03:11.727 --> 03:17.077
(Winona barks)
Applejack: (grunts) Attagirl. Yeehaw!

03:17.771 --> 03:22.085
(cheering)

03:23.128 --> 03:24.048
Applejack: Whoooooa!

03:26.001 --> 03:28.024
Hoo-wee!

03:28.245 --> 03:30.060
Now, what was THAT all about?

03:30.605 --> 03:33.072
(moos, clears throat)

03:33.716 --> 03:37.008
Oh, my! Begging your pardon, Applejack,

03:37.083 --> 03:41.077
but Mooriella here saw one of those nasty snakes.

03:41.774 --> 03:43.058
(cows gasp)

03:41.774 --> 03:43.058
(cows gasp)

03:43.585 --> 03:45.084
And it just gave us ALL the willies, don'tcha know!

03:45.837 --> 03:47.070
I completely understand.

03:47.695 --> 03:51.046
Just next time, try and steer clear o'Ponyville.

03:51.689 --> 03:55.057
We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!

03:55.568 --> 03:56.089
(Winona barks)

03:56.089 --> 04:02.079
(ponies cheer, Winona barks)
Applejack: Yee-haw!

04:02.788 --> 04:05.048
Pinkie Pie: Yee-haw! Ride'em, cowpony!

04:05.481 --> 04:09.066
Mayor: Applejack was just...just...
Pinkie Pie: Apple-TASTIC!

04:09.661 --> 04:11.056
Exactly!

04:11.565 --> 04:15.060
We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.

04:15.605 --> 04:19.009
Pinkie Pie: I know! A PARTY!

04:21.317 --> 04:22.089
Twilight: We all ready?

04:22.896 --> 04:24.031
Just one last thing.

04:30.211 --> 04:31.046
Rarity: NOW we're ready.

04:32.184 --> 04:33.090
Is Applejack all set?

04:33.903 --> 04:35.081
Rainbow Dash: Actually, I haven't seen her all week.

04:35.807 --> 04:37.020
Pinkie Pie: Not since the stampede.

04:37.002 --> 04:40.078
Rainbow Dash: But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is NEVER late!

04:44.398 --> 04:46.053
(ponies chattering)

04:46.534 --> 04:49.092
(notecards slapping desk)

04:51.225 --> 04:52.080
Twilight: Welcome, everypony!

04:52.804 --> 04:59.054
Today we are here to honor a pony we can always 
 count on to help in matters great and small.

04:59.537 --> 05:02.071
A pony whose contributions to- (crash)

05:03.002 --> 05:05.039
Rainbow Dash: Did you see Applejack's swift moves out there?!

05:05.389 --> 05:06.097
What an ATHLETE!

05:06.968 --> 05:09.085
This week, she's gonna help me with my new flying trick,

05:09.847 --> 05:12.077
and I know it's gonna be (squealing) so awesome!

05:12.773 --> 05:14.084
Twilight: EXACTLY. And-

05:14.839 --> 05:18.014
Pinkie Pie: This week, I get to run 
 Sugar Cube Corner for the first time!

05:18.137 --> 05:20.037
Twilight: What does that have to do with Applejack?

05:21.039 --> 05:22.011
OH!

05:22.107 --> 05:25.059
Applejack, one of the best bakers EVER, is gonna help me!

05:25.059 --> 05:29.077
Applejack makes everything great, so FREE SAMPLES FOR EVERYPONY!

05:29.077 --> 05:31.072
(ponies cheer)

05:31.072 --> 05:33.030
Twilight: Hokay, that's great.

05:33.299 --> 05:37.011
Twilight: Now, if I could just make a 
 point without being inter-
Fluttershy: Twilight? Twilight: -rupted...

05:37.107 --> 05:39.048
Fluttershy: Twilight, I'm so sorry,

05:39.476 --> 05:44.034
but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also 
 helping me this week with the official bunny census,

05:44.344 --> 05:47.065
where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season.

05:47.649 --> 05:51.018
She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.

05:51.968 --> 05:53.045
Twilight: (dryly) Anyone else?

05:53.454 --> 05:54.099
Anyone?

05:55.985 --> 05:57.005
Twilight: No?

05:58.214 --> 06:01.037
Well, then. As I was trying to say-

06:02.905 --> 06:05.050
(frustrated grunt) Never mind.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.068
(clears throat) And so, with no further ado,

06:09.917 --> 06:12.089
it is my privilege to give the prized Pony of Ponyville Award

06:12.982 --> 06:14.065
to our beloved guest of honor,

06:14.654 --> 06:16.079
a pony of the utmost trustworthiness,

06:16.086 --> 06:19.009
reliability, and integrity,

06:19.135 --> 06:23.055
Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend, Applejack!

06:23.547 --> 06:31.044
(ponies cheering, stop)
Spike: Cool, way to go, Applejack! That was awesome! I mean- heh...

06:33.016 --> 06:34.037
(clears throat nervously)

06:36.968 --> 06:38.041
Spike: (singsong) Awkward.

06:38.408 --> 06:41.029
Applejack: (groggily) I'm here! I'm here...

06:41.287 --> 06:47.060
(yawns deeply) Sorry I'm late-whoa! (trips, thuds) Was I just-

06:47.603 --> 06:48.081
Did I get your tail?

06:49.067 --> 06:55.048
Miss Mayor, thank you kindly for this here...award...thingy...

06:55.568 --> 07:01.037
(yawns) It's so bright and shiny and...heh...heheh...

07:01.373 --> 07:03.074
I sure do look funny, heh...

07:03.741 --> 07:10.057
Applejack and Pinkie Pie: Woooowooooowoooo!

07:10.568 --> 07:13.082
Twilight: Oookay. Well, thank you, Applejack,

07:13.818 --> 07:16.005
for saving us from that scary stampede,

07:16.048 --> 07:18.042
and always being there for everypony.

07:18.416 --> 07:22.064
(yawns) Yeah...I like helpin' the ponyfolk and...

07:22.642 --> 07:27.098
(yawns) and stuff... (snores)

07:28.238 --> 07:30.033
Oh! Uh...yeah, thanks!

07:30.328 --> 07:42.031
(trophy drags on ground loudly)

07:42.309 --> 07:45.056
Twilight: Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little-
Rainbow Dash: Tired?

07:45.056 --> 07:47.000
Fluttershy: Dizzy?
Rarity: Messy?

07:47.000 --> 07:50.006
(haughty) Well, did you SEE her mane?!

07:50.065 --> 07:53.034
Pinkie Pie: She seemed fine to me. WOO! WOO!

07:53.344 --> 07:54.099
(Twilight "hmm's")

07:57.402 --> 07:59.031
(Applejack grunts, kicks tree, apples thud into baskets)

08:00.607 --> 08:03.002
(Applejack grunts, kicks tree, apples thud into baskets)

08:03.904 --> 08:07.016
(Applejack grunts and kicks tree then sighs)

08:07.642 --> 08:09.013
(sighs sleepily, shakes self awake)

08:09.128 --> 08:11.096
(Applejack kicks, yelps)

08:11.961 --> 08:16.033
(Applejack kicks basket, apples roll out)
Twilight: What on earth is that pony doing?!

08:16.327 --> 08:17.016
Applejack: Whoops...

08:17.162 --> 08:20.076
Twilight: Hey, Applejack!
(Applejack snores)

08:20.762 --> 08:22.099
Twilight: Applejack!
(Applejack snores)

08:22.991 --> 08:25.064
Twilight: Applejack!
(Applejack snores)

08:25.638 --> 08:29.068
(Applejack snores)

08:29.678 --> 08:32.070
Twilight: APPLEJACK!
Applejack: Oh! (shakes self awake)

08:32.697 --> 08:34.037
Applejack: H-howdy, Twilight!

08:34.368 --> 08:35.090
Twilight: What IS all this?!

08:35.900 --> 08:37.085
Applejack: I-it's applebuck season!

08:39.941 --> 08:41.034
Applejack: (kicks tree, apples thud into baskets) Wh-whoa!

08:41.349 --> 08:42.087
Twilight: Applewhat season?

08:42.866 --> 08:47.032
Applejack: (frustrated grunt) It's what the Apple Family calls harvesting time.

08:47.325 --> 08:50.044
We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.

08:50.437 --> 08:52.053
Twilight: But...why are you doing it all alone?

08:52.526 --> 08:54.052
Applejack: 'Cause Big Macintosh hurt himself.

08:54.523 --> 08:58.019
Twilight: What about all those relatives I met when I first came to Ponyville?

08:58.192 --> 08:59.021
Can't they help?

08:59.214 --> 09:02.028
Applejack: (sighs) They were just here for the Apple Family Reunion.

09:02.279 --> 09:06.037
They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards.

09:06.366 --> 09:08.041
So, uh, I'm on my own.

09:08.409 --> 09:12.059
(poof)
Which means I should really get back to work.

09:14.797 --> 09:17.035
Applejack: (clears throat ostentatiously) Hint-hint?

09:17.349 --> 09:18.097
Applejack: Get back to work?

09:18.974 --> 09:19.086
Twilight: Fine.

09:19.856 --> 09:22.078
Applejack: (woozy) Uh, could you step aside, Twilight?

09:22.782 --> 09:27.006
Twilight: I just did... (echoing) Applejack, you don't look so good...

09:27.055 --> 09:32.002
Applejack: (shakes self awake) Don't any a'you three 
 worry none, I'm just fine and dandy.

09:32.024 --> 09:34.072
Applejack: (kicks tree) Wh-whoa...

09:34.717 --> 09:37.027
Twilight: Do you...want some help?

09:37.271 --> 09:40.052
Applejack: Help?! No way, no how.

09:40.522 --> 09:42.094
Twilight: But there's no way you can do it all on your own!

09:42.937 --> 09:46.010
Applejack: Is that a CHALLENGE?
Twilight: Um...no?

09:46.095 --> 09:50.004
Applejack: Well, I'm gonna PROVE t'you that I can do it!

09:50.042 --> 09:53.085
Now, if you'll EX-KYUUSE me, I've got apples t'buck.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.031
(Rainbow Dash tapping hoof on fencepost)

09:58.309 --> 10:03.014
Rainbow Dash: THERE you are!
Applejack: (yawns) I'm a-mite sorry, Rainbow...

10:03.138 --> 10:05.028
I was busy applebuckin' and I guess I-

10:05.275 --> 10:08.094
I closed my eyes for a second, and 
 when I woke up, I was late.

10:08.943 --> 10:11.022
Now, what's this new trick a'yours?

10:11.219 --> 10:12.057
Rainbow Dash: See this contraption?

10:12.566 --> 10:14.021
Applejack: Uh, yeah...

10:14.214 --> 10:16.016
Rainbow Dash: Well, I'm gonna stand on one end,

10:14.214 --> 10:16.016
Rainbow Dash: Well, I'm gonna stand on one end,

10:16.165 --> 10:18.067
then you're gonna jump down from that platform,

10:18.672 --> 10:22.043
launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own.

10:22.434 --> 10:26.061
Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some AMAZING flips and spins

10:26.614 --> 10:28.080
that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.016
Isn't that a mite dangerous?

10:31.165 --> 10:34.018
Heh, not for a pony who can fly.

10:34.183 --> 10:35.030
Well, all righty, then!

10:39.199 --> 10:40.027
(wind whistling)

10:42.031 --> 10:44.091
Applejack: (woozy) Oh my...

10:44.911 --> 10:47.037
Ready?! One...two...

10:47.372 --> 10:48.086
THREE!
(Applejack slams into ground, grunts)

10:49.088 --> 10:55.045
Uh, maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land ON the other end.

10:55.453 --> 10:57.096
Applejack: (face pops off ground, dazed) Got it...

10:57.961 --> 11:01.054
(thud, grunt, thud, grunt, thud, grunt)

11:01.537 --> 11:04.028
Rainbow Dash: Applejack, what the hay is goin' on?!

11:04.276 --> 11:07.039
I mean, I THOUGHT I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!

11:07.388 --> 11:10.092
(shakes self awake, talking loudly) You ARE! I'm okay...

11:10.917 --> 11:13.052
Really...I-I have an idea.

11:13.518 --> 11:18.086
Watch this. (groans, launcher creaks) Ta-da.

11:20.066 --> 11:21.064
Applejack: Oh...maybe not...

11:21.645 --> 11:24.080
Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time.

11:24.803 --> 11:26.001
(thud, Rainbow Dash grunts)

11:26.001 --> 11:27.045
(groans)

11:31.955 --> 11:34.037
Applejack: Heh heh...he-here I go!

11:36.506 --> 11:40.022
Rainbow Dash: WAIT! (into distance) APPLEJAAaaaaack...

11:41.008 --> 11:43.047
Applejack: (shouting) You're welcome!

11:47.303 --> 11:48.065
(approaching jet, Rainbow Dash screaming, crash)

11:49.718 --> 11:50.060
Can I help you?

11:51.668 --> 11:55.043
I think somepony else needs your help...

11:55.043 --> 11:57.066
Twilight: (flatly) Applejack?
Rainbow Dash: Yep.

12:04.068 --> 12:04.076
Applejack: (thunk) OW!

12:04.764 --> 12:06.048
(tuning fork wobbling)

12:06.483 --> 12:08.039
Twilight: Applejack, can we talk?

12:08.387 --> 12:10.043
(bubbles popping)

12:10.043 --> 12:12.098
Twilight: (echoing) Applejack, can we talk?

12:14.285 --> 12:17.068
Applejack: CAN BEES SQUAWK?! I-I DON'T THINK SO...

12:17.675 --> 12:19.016
Twilight: No. Can we talk?

12:19.161 --> 12:22.050
TWENTY STALKS?! BEAN OR CELERY?

12:22.504 --> 12:25.010
(louder) No! I need to talk to you!

12:25.105 --> 12:29.052
YOU NEED TO WALK TO THE ZOO?! WELL, WHO'S STOPPIN' YOU?

12:29.517 --> 12:31.028
(louder) I NEED to TALK to you!

12:31.282 --> 12:35.079
OH! WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?! WHATCHA WANNA TALK ABOUT?

12:35.786 --> 12:38.029
(loudly) Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today!

12:38.294 --> 12:40.062
THAT'S QUITE NEIGHBORLY OF HER.

12:40.616 --> 12:45.012
(shouting) YES, EXCEPT THAT SHE CRASHED ONTO MY BALCONY 
 AFTER YOU LAUNCHED HER INTO THE AIR.

12:45.121 --> 12:49.081
(normal volume) Oh, yeah...I wasn't feelin' quite myself this mornin'...

12:49.811 --> 12:52.078
Because you're working too hard, and you need HELP!

12:52.783 --> 12:57.020
What? Kelp?! I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed!

12:57.195 --> 12:59.019
(shouting) HELP! YOU NEED HELP!

12:59.192 --> 13:01.014
Nothin' doin', Twilight.

13:01.142 --> 13:05.088
I'm gonna prove t'you...t'everypony...that I can do this ON MY OWN.

13:05.879 --> 13:07.046
(thwap, Applejack yelps)

13:07.458 --> 13:12.024
Ugh...now if you'll EXCUSE me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie...

13:12.242 --> 13:13.068
(sighs)

13:14.842 --> 13:20.028
Mrs. Cake: Now, Pinkie Pie, are you SURE you're up to 
 baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?

13:20.276 --> 13:22.060
Yessirree bob, Mrs. Cake!

13:22.598 --> 13:25.034
Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.022
Why, she's the best baker EVER! Right, Applejack?
(Applejack shakes self awake)

13:28.217 --> 13:29.066
(Pinkie's words echo incoherently)

13:29.657 --> 13:31.024
(shakes self awake)

13:31.236 --> 13:33.065
Mr. Cake: No? You're not the best baker ever?

13:33.065 --> 13:37.050
What?! Oh no! I mean, don't you fret.

13:37.505 --> 13:41.022
I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.

13:41.022 --> 13:44.047
Mrs. Cake: Ohoho! Well, all right! Well, see you later, girls!

13:44.471 --> 13:45.072
(shakes self awake)

13:45.725 --> 13:48.084
Pinkie Pie: Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'!

13:49.997 --> 13:52.023
All righty! I'll get the sugar and the eggs.

13:52.226 --> 13:53.071
Can you get me some chocolate chips?

13:53.712 --> 13:56.031
E-eh, uh...wh-what was that?

13:56.313 --> 13:59.052
(slowed down, distorted) Chocolate chips!

13:59.517 --> 14:03.005
"Chips"...got it. Tater chips...

14:03.047 --> 14:06.020
All salty'n'dry...okie-dokie.

14:06.205 --> 14:08.057
Applejack: (empties chips into bowl) What next?

14:08.573 --> 14:10.073
(slowed down, distorted) Baking soda!

14:10.733 --> 14:11.071
"Soda"...

14:11.708 --> 14:15.014
Perfect! That'll get the tater chips nice'n'wet.

14:15.144 --> 14:18.035
Applejack: (pours soda, shouts) NOW WHAT?

14:18.349 --> 14:19.047
Pinkie Pie: (normally) A cup of flour.

14:19.047 --> 14:21.074
A cup of sour?!

14:21.739 --> 14:24.002
Well, lemons are sure sour.

14:24.015 --> 14:26.010
Applejack: One cup o'sour comin' up.

14:27.059 --> 14:28.080
Anything else, Pinkie?

14:28.798 --> 14:30.084
Pinkie Pie: One last thing. Wheat germ.

14:30.841 --> 14:32.033
(grimaces) Wheat worms?!

14:32.327 --> 14:35.062
Oh! That must be fancy talk for earthworms!

14:40.222 --> 14:44.082
Pinkie Pie: Now THAT'S gonna be DELICIOUS!
Applejack: If you say so...

14:45.609 --> 14:49.056
Pinkie Pie: FREE MUFFIN SAMPLE SPECTACULAR!

14:49.556 --> 14:54.053
(ponies talk over each other)

14:54.526 --> 14:58.019
Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get'm while they're hot!

14:59.262 --> 15:02.047
Twilight: We came as soon as we heard!

15:02.467 --> 15:09.016
(sickly moans)
Nurse: Oh, thank you, Twilight. We need all the help we can get!

15:09.157 --> 15:11.085
Oh no! What happened?!

15:11.848 --> 15:15.028
Nurse: It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.

15:15.284 --> 15:18.054
Pinkie Pie: (weakly) No...not baked goods.

15:18.535 --> 15:21.062
Baked BADS... (gurgles)

15:21.623 --> 15:23.020
Applejack.

15:23.202 --> 15:25.025
Spike: (chewing noisily) Mm! Want one?

15:27.939 --> 15:32.077
Applejack: (kicks tree, snores, apple thuds) Wha?! Huh?!

15:34.859 --> 15:37.037
(cart rolling, Applejack yawning)

15:37.366 --> 15:39.041
(Applejack moans with exhaustion, apples roll out)

15:39.041 --> 15:40.099
(Applejack snoring loudly)

15:40.989 --> 15:43.050
Twilight: Applejack, we need to talk.

15:43.496 --> 15:46.079
Whoa?! Huh?! Oh, it's you, Twilight...

15:46.794 --> 15:51.053
(yawning) I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no.

15:51.531 --> 15:54.069
Not to upset your applecart, but you need help!

15:54.688 --> 15:58.082
Applejack: (sarcastic) Hardy-har. (strains) No, I don't.

15:59.681 --> 16:01.012
Twilight: Here. Let me help.

16:01.012 --> 16:03.021
Applejack: Help?! Nooo thanks.

16:03.021 --> 16:06.050
(straining) A little more...

16:06.496 --> 16:08.027
(cart creaking) Little...

16:08.272 --> 16:11.029
(straining, cart creaking, crash) ...There...

16:11.291 --> 16:16.054
(panting) I'll prove that THIS apple can handle THESE apples!

16:16.538 --> 16:20.095
(kicking tree repeatedly) Come on...apples...fall off!

16:20.095 --> 16:25.027
Twilight: AJ? I think you're beating a dead...tree.

16:26.662 --> 16:27.087
I-I knew that...

16:28.938 --> 16:31.054
Twilight: Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about.

16:31.539 --> 16:33.095
I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care, and-

16:33.953 --> 16:37.006
Applejack: Y'know, I'm a LITTLE busy to get lectured right now, Twilight...

16:37.065 --> 16:38.069
Twilight: But if you'd just let me help-

16:38.069 --> 16:41.008
Applejack: UGH! No...no...NO!

16:41.755 --> 16:44.004
How many times do I gotta say it?!

16:44.449 --> 16:47.005
I don't need NO help from NOpony!

16:47.514 --> 16:51.001
Twilight: Uuugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.

16:51.136 --> 16:52.007
(mule neighs)
Twilight: No offense.

16:52.669 --> 16:54.005
Mule: None taken.

16:57.429 --> 16:58.004
Fluttershy: Oh, Applejack.

16:58.045 --> 17:02.005
Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit round-up.

17:02.537 --> 17:04.008
Applejack: (annoyed) Ugh. Why are we doin' this?

17:04.766 --> 17:07.006
Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born,

17:07.646 --> 17:10.002
so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.

17:10.002 --> 17:12.002
Applejack: (impatiently) Fine. Can we just get on with it?!

17:12.336 --> 17:16.009
Certainly. But remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows.

17:16.934 --> 17:19.002
They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.

17:19.163 --> 17:22.007
I do NOT need any direction on corralin' critters!

17:22.074 --> 17:24.006
Right, WInona?!
(Winona barks)

17:25.896 --> 17:27.006
Fluttershy: Okay, little bunnies.

17:27.615 --> 17:30.004
(gently) I need you to all gather here in the middle.

17:31.191 --> 17:33.002
Applejack: (intimidating) That's right! Let's go, bunnies!

17:33.211 --> 17:35.000
In the center! Hop to it!

17:35.022 --> 17:37.003
...Swell. Just swell.

17:39.341 --> 17:41.005
Put 'em up, Winona!

17:41.523 --> 17:43.008
(Winona barking)

17:46.539 --> 17:50.003
Fluttershy: Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them!

17:50.347 --> 17:52.000
Applejack: We know what we're doin'!

17:52.019 --> 17:53.005
Git along, little bunnies!

17:53.459 --> 17:54.006
(Winona barks)

17:54.573 --> 17:57.009
(Winona growls)

17:58.985 --> 18:01.000
Fluttershy: Oh no...

18:00.982 --> 18:02.002
(bunnies scream)

18:04.697 --> 18:07.005
(ground rumbling)

18:07.483 --> 18:09.005
STAMPEEEEEDE!

18:09.527 --> 18:14.006
(ponies panic, doors slam shut)

18:14.635 --> 18:23.009
(rumble grows more intense)

18:23.923 --> 18:25.005
(faints)

18:32.422 --> 18:34.007
(Twilight humming tunelessly)

18:34.744 --> 18:35.005
(gasps)

18:35.487 --> 18:39.002
The horror, THE HORROR!

18:39.202 --> 18:40.005
It was AWFUL!

18:40.456 --> 18:43.001
A DISASTER! A horrible, horrible DISASTER!

18:44.821 --> 18:46.002
Twilight: I don't get it.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.006
Our gardens! Destroyed!

18:48.629 --> 18:50.004
Every last flower, devoured!

18:50.044 --> 18:53.000
By...by... (shrieks) THEM!

18:53.041 --> 18:56.000
Fluttershy: (frantic) Oh...oh my! Please stop, little bunnies.

18:55.967 --> 19:00.001
Nono! Please! Let's go home! (panting) Oh my goodness...

19:00.146 --> 19:03.004
All right. Enough is enough.

19:05.069 --> 19:07.005
Applejack: (wearily) Must...keep...buckin'...

19:07.053 --> 19:13.000
(kicking tree repeatedly) Just...a few...more...must...finish...harvestin'...

19:12.964 --> 19:13.009
Twilight: All right, Applejack.

19:13.939 --> 19:16.004
Your applebucking hasn't just caused YOU problems,

19:16.447 --> 19:17.009
it's over-propelled a pegasus,

19:17.933 --> 19:19.009
practically poisoned plenty of ponies,

19:19.883 --> 19:22.001
and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies.

19:22.112 --> 19:23.006
I don't care WHAT you say,

19:23.552 --> 19:25.000
YOU. NEED. HELP.

19:25.038 --> 19:29.004
Applejack: (grunts, kicks tree, apples land in baskets) Heh! No I don't!

19:29.357 --> 19:31.001
Look! I did it!

19:31.122 --> 19:36.001
I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without yer help.

19:36.137 --> 19:38.009
(chuckles) How'dya like THEM apples?!

19:38.877 --> 19:42.005
Big Mac: Um...How do YOU like THEM apples?

19:42.499 --> 19:51.006
Applejack: (trembling) A-a-apples... (incoherent rambling, faints)

19:53.227 --> 19:55.008
Twilight: (faint) Applejack? (normal) Applejack!

19:55.828 --> 19:56.009
Applejack: Huh...?

19:56.942 --> 19:58.007
Oh good. You're okay.

19:58.707 --> 20:02.005
Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.009
You're always there to help anypony in need,

20:04.093 --> 20:08.000
so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside

20:07.995 --> 20:09.007
and allow your friends to help you?

20:10.596 --> 20:11.009
(resigned) Okay, Twilight.

20:11.896 --> 20:14.002
I am not taking "no" for an answer- (doubletakes) What?!

20:14.218 --> 20:17.003
Yes, Twilight. (pleading) Yes, please...

20:17.329 --> 20:19.001
I could really use your help...

20:19.094 --> 20:22.000
(Twilight giggles, sighs with relief)

20:23.041 --> 20:24.009
Twilight: (voice-over) "Dear Princess Celestia,

20:24.887 --> 20:28.007
My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have,

20:28.707 --> 20:30.008
and she's always there to help anypony.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.004
The only trouble is,

20:32.422 --> 20:33.004
when she needs help,

20:33.444 --> 20:34.009
she finds it hard to accept it.

20:34.093 --> 20:37.009
So, while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends,

20:37.925 --> 20:40.005
it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer.

20:40.526 --> 20:43.004
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

20:43.359 --> 20:45.003
How 'bout y'all take a little break?

20:45.263 --> 20:47.007
Applejack: I got some fiiine apple juice waitin' for ya.

20:48.486 --> 20:51.003
(sighs) Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help.

20:51.347 --> 20:54.001
I was actin' a...bit stubborn.

20:54.087 --> 20:54.009
A bit?!

20:54.918 --> 20:57.003
Okay, a MITE stubborn.

20:57.337 --> 20:59.004
And I'm awful sorry.

20:59.427 --> 21:03.001
Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony Award,

21:03.096 --> 21:07.002
but the real award is havin' you five as my friends.

21:07.229 --> 21:09.000
(slurping)

21:09.004 --> 21:12.008
Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry!

21:12.755 --> 21:15.005
Spike: And I've got the perfect treat!
Pinkie Pie: Eeewww!

21:15.495 --> 21:18.004
Spike, I threw those away! Where'd you get them?!

21:18.421 --> 21:19.006
From the trash.

21:19.582 --> 21:21.009
(ponies all revulse)

21:21.858 --> 21:24.002
Spike: Just a liiittle nibble?

21:24.018 --> 21:28.007
Spike: Come on!
(ponies moan in disgust)

21:30.002 --> 21:32.003
(ending theme begins) My Little Pony

21:34.582 --> 21:36.004
My Little Pony

21:38.715 --> 21:47.004
(instrumental)

21:47.004 --> 21:53.008
My Little Pony, friends
