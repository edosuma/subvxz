WEBVTT

00:10.219 --> 00:13.013
What am I supposed to be feeling
right now?

00:13.639 --> 00:15.057
Extreme relaxation.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.851
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

00:17.935 --> 00:20.020
Going through a tough time
at the moment.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.648
Some stuff going on
with my brother and--

00:22.731 --> 00:24.274
It helps if you stop speaking.

00:24.942 --> 00:25.943
Right, right.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.071
Yeah, that's not gonna happen either.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.406
We both have done things
we shouldn't have,

00:31.490 --> 00:33.784
and I'll admit
I'm not innocent in all this.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.620
Do you think I should call him
or wait for him to call me?

00:37.246 --> 00:39.623
-Sorry, did you ask me a question?
-Can you get off my mat?

00:40.332 --> 00:42.292
Oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.752
So I called him.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.046
Sometimes you have to be
the bigger person, you know?

00:46.129 --> 00:49.341
I would have preferred for him to call me,
but, what can I say?

00:49.424 --> 00:51.885
I'm a great fucking human being,
so sue me.

00:51.969 --> 00:55.013
Besides, it's my birthday tomorrow.
What's he gonna do, ignore it?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.308
Don't fuck me on the fixings, Ray.
It's been a long day.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.928
Say hi to the people at home.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.639
-Ike, can you put that thing down.
-You're doing great.

02:18.722 --> 02:22.476
-No, I'm so thirsty.
-I got it. I got it. Here, here.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.144
All right, deep breath.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.854
Your ice chips, madame?

02:26.563 --> 02:29.441
You're lucky to have
such a supportive partner.

02:29.525 --> 02:30.567
You women are warriors.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.985
I think we're ready to push.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.529
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.448
-Baby's crowning.
-Wait. Hold on, hold on.

02:36.532 --> 02:37.699
-Keep pushing.
-Hold on.

02:37.783 --> 02:40.953
-Not yet, not yet!
-Ike, put that fucking thing down!

02:41.036 --> 02:42.746
-Keep pushing. Keep pushing.
-Ike!

02:42.829 --> 02:45.040
-You're doing great. I'll be here. Push.
-There we go!

02:45.123 --> 02:46.542
Push. I gotta focus.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.211
One more push! One more push!

02:49.294 --> 02:50.504
There we go.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.548
You did it! It's a boy! It's a boy!

02:52.631 --> 02:54.466
Actually, that's the umbilical cord.

02:54.550 --> 02:55.843
This would be a girl.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.719
-It's a girl.
-Yes, good girl.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.055
-It's a girl.
-And-- Yeah--

03:00.138 --> 03:01.640
-It's a girl.
-And she brought a friend.

03:01.723 --> 03:02.724
What?

03:02.808 --> 03:05.561
I've got news for you, Mom and Dad.
Your work's not done here.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.229
-You're having twins.
-Twins?

03:07.312 --> 03:08.522
-Double the joy.
-Yes, twins.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.315
Now, Bonnie, come on, I need you to--

03:10.399 --> 03:12.651
-Yes, Bonnie.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.529
-Yeah-- Twin-- Oh, my--
-No!

03:15.612 --> 03:18.740
So Cathy was giving me sass, saying,

03:18.824 --> 03:21.827
"Marty, I gave you
the purchase orders to sign."

03:21.910 --> 03:25.372
And I remember what you said,
so I pushed back.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.582
And I said, "Really, Cath?

03:26.665 --> 03:30.002
Because I know for a fact that you didn't
because I would have signed them.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.296
So, can you please go check again?"

03:32.921 --> 03:35.215
So, she goes back to her desk,

03:35.299 --> 03:39.636
and there sitting on her desk
underneath a pile of old Peoples--

03:41.763 --> 03:42.764
Dr. Ike.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.309
Dr. Ike.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.478
No, no, I--

03:50.022 --> 03:53.567
A pile of old people. Continue.

03:53.650 --> 03:57.654
-Are you all right?
-Marty, forgive me. I'm sorry. I--

04:00.199 --> 04:01.617
I haven't been getting much sleep.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.162
Who could blame you with twin baby girls
at home? What's that like?

04:05.913 --> 04:08.040
Are you comfortable with me
cursing in our session?

04:08.123 --> 04:09.166
-Please.
-Good.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.836
Because it's the fucking best, Marty.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.339
Fatherhood is… indescribable.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.176
You have to experience it for yourself.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.804
I mean it.
Have you ever thought about being a dad?

04:22.888 --> 04:25.182
Me? No, I don't know.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.477
I mean, I really love being an uncle.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.230
Loved.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.774
Marty, what do you want your legacy to be?

04:34.316 --> 04:35.526
My legacy?

04:36.735 --> 04:38.612
Gosh. I--

04:39.863 --> 04:41.240
I've never really thought about it.

04:41.323 --> 04:44.993
Well, to be honest,
before the girls, neither had I.

04:45.911 --> 04:49.206
But when a man looks into the eyes
of his children for the first time,

04:49.289 --> 04:52.459
he becomes painfully aware
of his own mortality.

04:52.543 --> 04:53.544
You feel this…

04:55.712 --> 04:58.507
this urgency to make sure
you leave the world

04:58.590 --> 05:00.342
a better place than the one you found.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.762
That's really beautiful, Ike.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.431
Have you ever been in love?

05:06.515 --> 05:09.059
I don't know. Does anyone really know?

05:09.142 --> 05:11.436
Yeah. Yes, they do.

05:11.520 --> 05:15.399
Well, then I guess
I would have to say no.

05:15.482 --> 05:19.403
Can't say that I have.
Maybe starting a family is not my legacy.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.489
Marty, listen to me.
Your legacy is yet to be written.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.159
There's plenty of time for that.
You need to find the right person.

05:27.494 --> 05:31.081
Or, if not, there are plenty of other ways
to leave your mark on this world.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.165
I guess.

05:32.249 --> 05:36.879
If it were me and I had your… assets.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.090
I'd give back.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.468
-To?
-Others. The world.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.682
Start a foundation or something.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.685
I mean, think of how amazing
that must feel.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.438
I've been thinking a lot
about you and your…

05:55.939 --> 05:59.318
your considerable means
since the whole Phyllis affair.

05:59.401 --> 06:03.071
I'll be honest,
I don't think that is behind me.

06:03.739 --> 06:07.075
I feel terrible
about the way it all ended.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.493
We've talked about this.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.205
Phyllis was toxic. She robbed you.

06:11.914 --> 06:14.249
She violated a lifetime of trust.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.544
You did the right thing
by cutting her out of your life.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.465
But look, enough about the past.
Let's look to the future.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.302
Maybe starting a foundation

06:26.762 --> 06:29.723
is the exact kind of distraction
you need right now.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.893
Use your money to help the world.
What a legacy that would be.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.771
Look, I love the sound
of what you're saying.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.272
I really do.

06:38.565 --> 06:43.153
I just-- I wouldn't know where to begin,
how to start something like that.

06:43.237 --> 06:47.533
It's not that complicated, actually.
In fact, they make it fairly easy.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.159
I'm planning on starting one myself

06:49.243 --> 06:52.996
once I have a little more money
squirreled away.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.753
Maybe we could start one together.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.672
-You and me?
-Why not?

07:02.673 --> 07:04.132
We work well together, don't we?

07:06.009 --> 07:07.010
We do.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.681
-We really do.
-Yeah.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.935
So let's do it. You know?

07:15.018 --> 07:16.353
Be a force for good.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.438
Make a legacy.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.780
All righty.
Your 501(c)(3) status is approved,

07:26.864 --> 07:28.949
and your account is now open.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.159
Did you gentleman want to make
an initial deposit today?

07:31.243 --> 07:34.872
Indeed, we did. 165,000 shekels.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.083
-Ever seen a check that big?
-I work in the bank.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.752
-Right, no. Of course. Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.009
I'm making the initial investment.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.594
I'll be giving as we go.

07:48.677 --> 07:52.055
Yeah, I'm the bachelor here,
so I'm sitting on a little more cash.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.349
This guy just had twins. New dad alert.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.143
Oh, brother, I tell you.

07:56.226 --> 07:59.271
-Twin poop machines.
-You want a hot stock tip?

07:59.354 --> 08:01.064
Buy shares in Pampers.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.444
Understood. But if you both
are to be cosigners on the account,

08:05.527 --> 08:08.405
you both need to invest something
at the start.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.740
It could be anything.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.995
Hey, yeah.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.247
Of course.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.792
Like… 5,000?

08:20.876 --> 08:22.044
Anything.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.963
-2,000?
-Sure.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.174
2,500.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.258
Best and final.

08:28.342 --> 08:31.220
Sir, you're negotiating with yourself.
Anything is fine.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.181
2,500. Yeah, it's good with me, really.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.850
My assets are a bit illiquid
at the moment,

08:36.933 --> 08:39.645
but I promise
I'll double this contribution

08:39.727 --> 08:40.895
in the very near future.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.313
I'll double it, Marty.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.608
Dr. Ike, it's fine.
I know you'll double it.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.403
Well, 2,500 it is.

08:48.487 --> 08:49.571
To be doubled.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.957
You gentleman each want
check signing authority, is that correct?

09:00.040 --> 09:04.211
Absolutely, yes.
Yes, this is a 50/50 partnership.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.005
I'll get the checkbook.

09:11.844 --> 09:14.721
You know that I wish I had
more to contribute, Marty.

09:14.805 --> 09:15.848
You know that, right?

09:15.931 --> 09:19.309
What you've given me
cannot be calculated in a bank ledger.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.862
Joe, are you back there?

09:29.945 --> 09:34.408
Ike and I have some priceless heirlooms
we need enshrined for posterity.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.704
Hey, can I help you guys?

09:40.455 --> 09:42.332
Sorry. I was expecting Joe.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.751
I'm Hannah. Joe's my neighbor.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.921
I just started working here.
Are you and Joe friends?

09:48.005 --> 09:51.091
Not really. I buy frames from him.

09:51.175 --> 09:54.303
Right. Well, that would make sense.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.972
That is sort of our whole deal here.

10:01.185 --> 10:02.186
Yeah.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.355
I'm Marty.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.982
-I'm Hannah.
-You already said that.

10:08.108 --> 10:08.817
Sorry.

10:08.901 --> 10:10.402
I'm Marty. There, we're even.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.362
Thank you.

10:12.988 --> 10:15.115
That's nice. Okay.

10:15.199 --> 10:18.035
-So, Marty, what…
-Yes.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.204
-What can I do for you?
-Nothing fancy,

10:20.871 --> 10:26.543
just have this 8-by-10 document
framed alongside these two receipts.

10:26.627 --> 10:31.381
Maybe a one or two-inch black matte
against a 3/4 inch cherry wood frame?

10:32.424 --> 10:34.051
My, you really know your stuff.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.345
You live long enough,

10:36.428 --> 10:40.390
you pick up a few things about
reverse molding and shadow boxes.

10:40.474 --> 10:43.602
No, now, come on.
You clearly have a good eye.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.646
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.731
No, you're the one with the good eye.

10:48.357 --> 10:49.983
Eyes, two eyes.

10:50.067 --> 10:54.154
The regular number of nice eyes.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.280
The…

10:56.865 --> 10:59.618
appropriate quota of ocular spheres.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.120
Thank you, I think.

11:02.204 --> 11:03.288
Yeah.

11:04.373 --> 11:07.835
Okay, so,
it should just be a couple of days.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.546
-Come back, see me on Thursday.
-Thursday, all right.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.714
-Thursday. Yeah. My favorite day.
-Thursday.

11:12.798 --> 11:16.343
AKA Thor's day.
After the Norse god of thunder.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.427
-Thor.
-Yes.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.512
Of course, yes.

11:18.595 --> 11:23.517
Basically the equivalent of Jupiter
or Jove in the Roman Pantheon,

11:23.600 --> 11:24.768
but, anyway.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.895
-Okay. See you Thursday.
-Thank you so much. Great.

11:26.979 --> 11:27.980
-Sure.
-All right.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.274
-Night. Bye. Bye, Marty.
-Bye.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.069
-That was astounding, Marty.
-Run!

11:35.529 --> 11:39.116
Not a word of it made any sense
at all, but the way you said it.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.325
Can we please just run?

11:40.409 --> 11:42.744
Pheromones were oozing out of you, Marty.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.162
They were oozing.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.707
You were like a beast.
Wait, why are we running?

11:46.790 --> 11:48.125
I don't know! Run!

11:48.208 --> 11:50.127
You are growing, Marty!

11:51.712 --> 11:55.090
I'm so tired. Why won't they sleep?
They never sleep.

11:58.594 --> 11:59.386
Oh, no.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.971
-Come here, come here.
-Okay.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.390
Okay. Okay. Okay.

12:03.891 --> 12:04.975
Come here.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.356
-Can I help you?
-PJ Bernstein's.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.359
Oh, shit, the deli.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.236
-You ordered this, right?
-I did, yes.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.280
I forgot to cancel.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.450
You know what, our event
isn't actually happening tonight.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.035
What's all this?

12:23.118 --> 12:25.954
It's a spread from PJ Bernstein's.
I forgot to cancel.

12:26.747 --> 12:27.956
You can take it back.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.375
We need 24 hours' notice
for cancellations.

12:30.459 --> 12:32.794
What? Baloney, I'm not paying for this.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.713
You already did. They ran your card.

12:37.466 --> 12:41.720
Fine. All right, then I do want it,
but not because you're forcing it on me.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.180
Because I'm actually hungry.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.185
-But no tip.
-Tip's included.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.355
You know what, just put it on the counter.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.784
-Leave my home.
-Enjoy your meal.

13:05.661 --> 13:06.745
They're asleep.

13:07.538 --> 13:09.540
Ike, my God.

13:09.623 --> 13:13.126
Why on earth did you order a deli platter
for 50 people?

13:13.210 --> 13:15.087
I had to place the order in advance.

13:15.754 --> 13:19.967
I thought maybe we'd be hosting
a bris tonight, that's all.

13:21.260 --> 13:24.763
-Were you hoping for a boy?
-What? No. No, of course not.

13:24.847 --> 13:28.308
No, I just wanted to be ready
in case it was a boy.

13:28.392 --> 13:30.853
Oh, my God. You wanted a boy.

13:31.687 --> 13:35.107
No, I didn't. I promise.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.485
No.

13:41.113 --> 13:42.322
I just…

13:45.158 --> 13:47.870
I always had a dream that I would

13:49.162 --> 13:51.290
host a bris for my son.

13:51.957 --> 13:56.253
And we'd invite people from the synagogue,
my colleagues from the hospital.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.424
-My dad.
-Ike, don't do this to yourself.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.718
-Do what to myself?
-You are a father yourself now.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.344
You don't need to impress him anymore.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.347
Okay, you've been trying
for over 30 years, and he's--

14:07.431 --> 14:09.183
-Honey--
-Nah. Come on. Please.

14:09.266 --> 14:11.268
Let's forget I said anything.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.145
Come on, let's eat.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.400
I may have overdone it on the whitefish.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.822
Ike, I don't think I can do this anymore.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.742
It's too much with two.
I need some help.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.369
Cindy gave me the name of this
baby nurse she said is available.

14:29.453 --> 14:31.580
-I'm gonna call her.
-Isn't that expensive?

14:31.663 --> 14:34.791
350 a week for a decent night's sleep?
I would pay double that.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.669
350 a week?
That's a little steep, don't you think?

14:37.753 --> 14:40.130
There's only so many mommy issues
in New York I can treat.

14:40.214 --> 14:43.425
So you'll spend money on this deli
spread for a party that doesn't happen,

14:43.509 --> 14:45.427
but you won't spend it
on your wife and children?

14:45.511 --> 14:47.429
Come on, that's different.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.015
We don't need the help. We're doing fine.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.809
You're doing fine
because your nipples aren't bleeding,

14:52.893 --> 14:55.187
and you can go to the bathroom
without crying.

14:55.270 --> 14:57.940
That's low, Bonnie.
You know I would do more if I could.

14:58.023 --> 15:01.318
Well, you can't, and you don't.
I do, and I need this.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.531
Ike, please, you're at work all day.
I can't do this alone.

15:05.614 --> 15:09.451
Oh, come on, sweetie.
Of course you can, you're supermom.

15:12.371 --> 15:14.623
Okay, fine.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.292
I don't even know
why we're arguing about this.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.087
You know what? I'll just use my own money.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.509
Oh, my goodness.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.595
Look at those two punims. Little angels.

15:28.679 --> 15:31.557
-Aren't they something?
-Look at that one, Dr. Ike.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.811
Look at your face. It's like,
"Sorry, girls. Milk factory's closed."

15:38.438 --> 15:41.275
You are hilarious. Got a lot to offer.

15:42.651 --> 15:46.321
Hey, the girl at the frame store
certainly thought so.

15:46.405 --> 15:47.906
Well… yeah.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.157
She liked you.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.285
I can see why.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.871
You're an extremely eligible bachelor.

15:53.954 --> 15:57.541
So, you're saying I should ask Hannah out?

15:57.624 --> 16:00.169
I think you know the answer
to that question,

16:00.252 --> 16:01.879
but we're out of time.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.798
Okay.

16:04.882 --> 16:06.341
Hey, Marty.

16:06.425 --> 16:07.593
Yeah?

16:07.676 --> 16:10.220
Do you have a second for some
quick Yaron business?

16:10.304 --> 16:11.930
Yeah, sure.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.600
A colleague of mine from NYU sent me this.

16:15.809 --> 16:16.810
PEN Gala.

16:16.894 --> 16:19.188
It's one of the biggest
philanthropic events of the year.

16:19.271 --> 16:21.773
They raise a lot of money
for incredible charities.

16:21.857 --> 16:26.111
I think this would be the perfect way
to officially launch the Yaron Foundation.

16:26.904 --> 16:30.115
-What do you say?
-A thousand dollars a plate.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.617
Yeah, just standard.

16:32.534 --> 16:35.204
Yeah. Can I think about it?

16:36.997 --> 16:38.123
Sure thing, pal.

16:39.333 --> 16:42.628
I mean, you know, it's a good way
to give back,

16:42.711 --> 16:44.338
but take all the time you need.

16:44.421 --> 16:45.839
No pressure.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.347
Marty, hi!

16:53.430 --> 16:55.307
-Hey there.
-Happy Thor's day.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.268
-Happy Thor's day to you.
-Yeah.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.686
Yeah.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.730
-I've got your frames. So--
-Oh, okay.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.690
Be right back.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.161
Here they are.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.289
That's great.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.915
-Yeah?
-Really nice.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.291
I did them myself.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.377
Lovely work. How much do I owe you?

17:24.461 --> 17:26.421
-On the house.
-Really?

17:26.505 --> 17:27.506
No.

17:28.131 --> 17:31.593
That's-- It-- There--
It's $59.95 for the--

17:31.677 --> 17:33.512
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.

17:33.595 --> 17:36.849
-Think I'm just… nervous.
-You're nervous?

17:36.932 --> 17:40.102
I literally have Burger King napkins
in my armpits right now.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.604
-Gross, Marty. Just kidding.
-No.

17:42.688 --> 17:44.439
-It's a little gross.
-It is gross.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.401
Why would you be nervous?

17:48.402 --> 17:49.778
Well, Hannah, I--

17:49.862 --> 17:52.197
There's a question I'd like to ask you.

17:52.823 --> 17:53.824
-Sure.
-Okay.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.409
Fire away.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.785
Do you…

17:59.288 --> 18:01.748
outside of going to work…

18:04.418 --> 18:06.086
Do you ever leave your house?

18:07.296 --> 18:09.381
Apartment. I don't know where you live.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.925
I don't know what kind of dwelling
you live in, but--

18:12.467 --> 18:14.970
-It's an apartment. I do.
-You leave it?

18:15.053 --> 18:17.222
Sometimes I leave it.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.104
So…

18:28.692 --> 18:29.693
Yes!

18:49.463 --> 18:52.674
What is that?
Some kind of freaking time machine?

18:52.758 --> 18:54.009
It's a new coffee maker.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.802
What was wrong with Mr. Coffee?

18:55.886 --> 18:59.556
Nothin'. This is just
one of Mr. Stevens' new changes.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.934
Oh, well, at least they're springing
for some nice coffee.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.228
No, no, no, no, don't open that.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.437
It's whitefish.

19:05.521 --> 19:07.773
Why?
Why is there whitefish in the coffee can?

19:07.856 --> 19:10.067
-Yeah, I don't know.
-Morning, team.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.568
-Good morning.
-Morning.

19:11.652 --> 19:12.861
How's everyone?

19:12.945 --> 19:15.572
Fine. Just fine.

19:25.749 --> 19:28.919
Try the whitefish?
PJ Bernstein's. Sensational whitefish.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.838
I think I'm gonna pass.

19:30.921 --> 19:32.464
Yeah, looking more for something sweet.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.175
What are executive Bonkers?

19:36.134 --> 19:37.886
They're Bonkers for executives.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.097
-Well, can I have one?
-He loves Bonkers.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.849
-Are you an executive?
-No.

19:41.932 --> 19:44.226
Then I think you just answered
your own question, pal.

19:44.309 --> 19:48.522
Snacks only for executives.
You don't think that's a little extreme?

19:49.398 --> 19:51.817
Guys, sorry. It's out of my hands.

19:53.193 --> 19:56.530
Norman Horowitz
is a real hard ass about this stuff.

19:56.613 --> 20:00.993
If you want, I can talk to him,
put in a good word. He listens to me.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.327
Nice.

20:04.288 --> 20:06.582
All right. Go team.

20:06.665 --> 20:08.876
-Yes. Go.
-Yeah, go.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.935
Hey, Marty, some of us were talking,
and we were--

20:27.019 --> 20:30.230
That is we wondered-- Cathy, you say.

20:30.314 --> 20:32.858
How long is Mr. Stevens
gonna be hanging around?

20:32.941 --> 20:36.153
As long as we need him.
Think of him as a valuable resource.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.405
The more time he's around,
the better for all of us.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.240
It's just some of the changes
around here--

20:40.324 --> 20:42.784
Will you excuse me, Bruce?
I have a high-level meeting.

20:42.868 --> 20:44.828
-But, Marty…
-Marty…

20:46.830 --> 20:48.081
Ike.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.708
You're not gonna believe what happened.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.503
That's great.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

20:52.586 --> 20:55.380
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Inside. Just go in here? Yeah, great.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.049
-Not a problem at all.
-Great.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.720
Marty, I'm gonna shoot something
your way, and if you like it, great.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.097
You don't, swat it out of the air.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.432
-Okay.
-Great.

21:05.516 --> 21:08.936
Is there a small work space
I can occupy while I'm here?

21:09.019 --> 21:11.438
Maybe an office?
I hate to feel like I'm in the way.

21:11.522 --> 21:14.942
Sure, I thought you wanted to be
boots on the ground,

21:15.025 --> 21:16.902
float amongst the staff,
that kind of thing.

21:17.486 --> 21:18.862
My thoughts on that have evolved.

21:20.030 --> 21:24.535
I'm concerned people might be confused
if there isn't an observable hierarchy,

21:25.118 --> 21:28.121
and they might feel rudderless
or insecure.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.540
Does that make sense?

21:30.499 --> 21:32.417
Yeah. Complete sense.

21:32.501 --> 21:35.629
Great. The workers,
they know my status here,

21:36.421 --> 21:38.090
but they need to see it a little bit more.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.424
This is for them, not for me.

21:39.508 --> 21:41.802
Absolutely.
No. We'll get on it right away.

21:41.885 --> 21:44.555
Fantastic. Now, I must apologize.

21:44.638 --> 21:46.598
I interrupted you. What did you wanna say?

21:47.599 --> 21:49.977
Hannah, the girl at the frame store.

21:50.060 --> 21:52.563
-Yeah?
-I asked her out.

21:54.356 --> 21:59.111
Marty goddamn fucking Markowitz.
I'm so proud of you!

21:59.194 --> 22:02.322
-Where are you taking her?
-We're gonna go for a walk next week.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.825
-A walk? Walk to where?
-Yeah. I don't know.

22:05.576 --> 22:06.869
The park maybe?

22:09.329 --> 22:10.998
I love you, pal. Here.

22:11.832 --> 22:14.585
It's very sweet.
Let me tell you something.

22:14.668 --> 22:16.712
Women don't wanna walk.

22:17.421 --> 22:20.549
They wanna be wowed.
Swept off their feet. Impressed.

22:20.632 --> 22:23.635
Okay. So, where should I take her?

22:26.346 --> 22:27.931
-Oh, my God.
-What?

22:28.015 --> 22:29.183
-Oh, my God.
-What?

22:29.266 --> 22:30.809
Bring her to the PEN Gala.

22:33.270 --> 22:34.938
Gosh, Ike, I don't know.

22:35.022 --> 22:38.567
I do. It's perfect. I'll bring Bonnie.
You bring Hannah. Double date.

22:38.650 --> 22:41.904
It sounds amazing.
It's just-- Here's the thing.

22:41.987 --> 22:44.406
Four tickets at a thousand bucks a pop.

22:46.450 --> 22:48.744
I even thought two
sounded a little wasteful.

22:48.827 --> 22:50.329
Charity's not wasteful.

22:51.330 --> 22:52.748
It's the PEN Foundation, Marty.

22:52.831 --> 22:57.044
The printed word is the greatest weapon
our democracy has against tyranny.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.296
You care about democracy, don't you?

22:59.379 --> 23:00.964
Dr. Ike, I--

23:01.882 --> 23:05.719
I promise you, I love democracy,

23:05.802 --> 23:07.513
and I cannot stand tyranny.

23:08.096 --> 23:10.599
But, look,
why don't you and Bonnie just go?

23:10.682 --> 23:12.643
I don't have to go.

23:13.310 --> 23:14.895
I mean, four tickets.

23:14.978 --> 23:17.981
It just doesn't seem worth it. That's all.

23:18.065 --> 23:19.900
You know what? I think you might be right.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.487
-4,000 for four people is a rip-off.
-I think so.

23:23.570 --> 23:27.616
Especially when you can sponsor a table
that seats eight for only six grand.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.577
That's basically like
having a wholesale discount.

23:30.661 --> 23:32.496
See? We're already saving money.

23:33.372 --> 23:35.207
-I'll make the calls.
-Okay.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.752
And don't forget about the office.

23:38.836 --> 23:40.546
Yeah. All right.

23:42.714 --> 23:45.175
I don't know, honey.
It's not really my thing.

23:45.259 --> 23:47.302
What do you mean? It's the PEN Gala.

23:47.386 --> 23:50.389
I'm exhausted. I look like crap.
I can't fit into any of my clothes.

23:50.472 --> 23:53.433
-I just don't think I'll enjoy it.
-You won't enjoy the PEN Gala?

23:53.517 --> 23:56.311
Honey, I just gave birth,
like, 15 minutes ago.

23:56.395 --> 23:59.481
And now we got Anita here.
What else you pay her for?

24:02.317 --> 24:05.737
Why don't we go out? Just the two of us?

24:05.821 --> 24:08.156
Feel like I've barely seen you.

24:09.116 --> 24:13.120
Bon, I'm asking you
to come out of the house with me.

24:13.203 --> 24:16.164
It's the PEN Gala, for God's sakes.
I thought you'd be thrilled.

24:16.248 --> 24:19.084
I'm not crazy
about those kind of events,

24:19.168 --> 24:22.379
because I'm not crazy
about that version of you.

24:22.462 --> 24:23.463
What version of me?

24:23.547 --> 24:26.341
The one that comes out
at those types of occasions.

24:26.425 --> 24:29.428
The one who never knows
when enough is enough.

24:36.143 --> 24:38.937
Suit yourself, Bonnie.
But honestly, I--

24:39.771 --> 24:41.940
I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

24:47.237 --> 24:50.407
So I think I'll put
Kirschenbaum here,

24:50.490 --> 24:54.119
away from the band, and I'll put
Mitch Rosen close to the band.

24:54.203 --> 24:55.621
That way no one hears him chew.

24:55.704 --> 24:58.707
I take it you wanna be near the bathroom?

24:58.790 --> 24:59.791
Yeah.

25:01.043 --> 25:03.337
You okay? You look a little peaked.

25:03.420 --> 25:06.006
I'm just a little nervous, that's all.

25:06.089 --> 25:08.008
-'Bout the date?
-Yeah.

25:08.091 --> 25:10.135
Hey, you're gonna bowl her over.

25:10.219 --> 25:13.764
She's probably used to most schmucks
dragging her to Gray's Papaya.

25:14.389 --> 25:17.392
Which reminds me, I should probably
cut a check to the PEN Foundation.

25:17.476 --> 25:18.685
-Okay.
-Ledger in your office?

25:18.769 --> 25:20.187
Yep. Desk drawer.

25:23.148 --> 25:23.982
Marty.

25:24.566 --> 25:27.486
-Could we talk to you for a sec?
-Yeah, sure.

25:27.569 --> 25:30.197
Mr. Stevens just handed me

25:30.280 --> 25:37.079
these invoices for a total of
54 industrial psychology sessions.

25:38.205 --> 25:38.789
And?

25:38.872 --> 25:40.791
What would you like me to do about them?

25:40.874 --> 25:42.543
Pay them, obviously.

25:42.626 --> 25:44.002
Can we really afford that?

25:44.086 --> 25:45.838
Yes, we can. Thanks to Mr. Stevens,

25:45.921 --> 25:48.006
our margins hit an all-time high
last month.

25:48.090 --> 25:49.842
And so did our expenses.

25:49.925 --> 25:51.260
-What's that, Cathy?
-Nothing.

25:51.343 --> 25:55.222
Look, Marty. I'll admit Mr. Stevens
gave us some helpful pointers,

25:55.305 --> 25:59.226
but do we really need
a full-time industrial psychologist?

25:59.309 --> 26:02.271
Bruce, come on.
Look at all the changes around here.

26:02.354 --> 26:04.648
I have, and some of them
I'm not too crazy about.

26:04.731 --> 26:07.693
You have to embrace change,
or you can fight it,

26:07.776 --> 26:10.529
-but you can't stop it happening.
-But you can't stop it happening.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.948
Yes. That's what Mr. Stevens says.

26:13.031 --> 26:17.661
I just worry that his presence here
might be becoming a distraction.

26:18.537 --> 26:20.289
Well, gee-whiz, Bruce.

26:20.372 --> 26:22.207
Let's take a second to unpack that.

26:22.291 --> 26:25.919
Have you ever stopped to wonder
why you may be so easily distracted?

26:26.003 --> 26:27.045
What's that?

26:27.546 --> 26:32.509
That's Mr. Stevens' new desk.
Amish sandalwood.

26:33.844 --> 26:34.845
Nice.

26:34.928 --> 26:37.181
Guys, Mr. Stevens is here to help.

26:37.264 --> 26:38.807
He's also here to stay.

26:39.516 --> 26:41.518
So, get used to it.

26:42.186 --> 26:44.813
Okay? Now then, go team!

26:46.523 --> 26:47.608
Go.

27:28.148 --> 27:29.525
Thank you so much.

27:30.234 --> 27:31.235
Hey!

27:31.902 --> 27:33.195
-Marty.
-Hannah.

27:33.278 --> 27:34.404
-Hi.
-Hi.

27:37.824 --> 27:38.909
You look great.

27:38.992 --> 27:39.993
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

27:40.077 --> 27:42.538
You look like James Bond.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.166
I got you something.

27:47.668 --> 27:49.628
Thank you. That's… nice.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.421
You didn't have to get me a gift.

27:51.505 --> 27:54.091
-Open it.
-Okay. Yeah.

27:57.052 --> 27:58.428
A picture frame.

27:58.512 --> 27:59.596
-Yeah.
-A picture frame.

27:59.680 --> 28:03.100
I figured everyone's always
getting picture frames from you,

28:03.183 --> 28:08.564
that it might be nice, for a change,
if someone gave a frame to you.

28:09.356 --> 28:10.357
That's a--

28:10.440 --> 28:13.694
-It's a terrible idea. I'm so sorry.
-No, no, it's not.

28:13.777 --> 28:18.282
No. This is great.
We don't carry this kind…

28:18.365 --> 28:21.285
-All right.
-…so this is new and interesting to me.

28:21.368 --> 28:24.329
-Okay.
-Thank you. So sweet.

28:24.413 --> 28:26.790
-Shall we go inside?
-Oh, yeah. Go.

28:29.877 --> 28:31.128
Watch your step.

28:37.551 --> 28:41.263
I could feel at the time

28:41.847 --> 28:45.767
There was no way of knowing

28:45.851 --> 28:49.521
Fallen leaves in the night

28:49.813 --> 28:51.481
Do it again. I was looking…

28:52.399 --> 28:53.775
Thank you, Ms. Fairchild.

28:58.197 --> 29:01.408
Marty, so who are all these people?

29:01.950 --> 29:02.910
I don't know.

29:04.953 --> 29:07.581
-Okay.
-Dr. Ike's friends.

29:07.664 --> 29:10.000
It's crazy. He's got so many of them.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.504
Why do you call him Dr. Ike?

29:13.587 --> 29:17.216
Is that like a nickname, like Dr. J?

29:17.799 --> 29:18.800
No.

29:20.093 --> 29:22.262
-Goofball.
-I'm sorry. I don't know.

29:22.346 --> 29:26.433
No. I mean, he is cool
and smooth like Dr. J.

29:26.517 --> 29:27.518
Obviously.

29:27.601 --> 29:30.187
And he's actually
quite a good basketball player.

29:30.270 --> 29:33.023
-But no, he's a real doctor.
-What kind of doctor?

29:33.815 --> 29:35.150
A psychiatrist.

29:37.736 --> 29:40.697
Is he your psychiatrist?

29:41.782 --> 29:43.825
Sorry. I hope that was okay to ask.

29:43.909 --> 29:45.619
No. Well…

29:49.164 --> 29:50.457
Yeah.

29:50.541 --> 29:51.542
Yeah.

29:51.625 --> 29:53.085
Cool. No, I-- Yeah.

29:53.168 --> 29:54.419
-Yeah.
-Okay.

29:54.503 --> 29:55.504
Yeah.

29:55.587 --> 29:59.049
Yeah. Psychiatrist. Business partner.

29:59.132 --> 30:00.342
Best friend.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.012
That's…

30:04.888 --> 30:05.931
How does that all work?

30:06.765 --> 30:08.016
It works great.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.101
-Yeah.
-Yes.

30:10.185 --> 30:14.106
He's kind of the brains of the operation,
and I'm sort of the…

30:14.189 --> 30:16.358
The what? The heart?

30:18.485 --> 30:20.445
I was gonna say the bank.

30:21.613 --> 30:26.076
But yes, heart too.
I'm the heart as well. Yeah.

30:27.661 --> 30:30.497
So you paid for all of this?

30:32.040 --> 30:34.001
Yeah, the-- Your own table.

30:37.379 --> 30:38.755
You're welcome.

30:38.839 --> 30:39.840
Hi.

30:40.424 --> 30:42.759
-It's for a great cause.
-Yeah.

30:42.843 --> 30:45.387
Causes, in fact. Legacy, philanthropy.

30:45.470 --> 30:48.098
I think democracy is somewhere in there--
The list goes on and on.

30:48.182 --> 30:51.476
With this organization,
this evening benefits the people.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.520
They do-- It's--

30:54.062 --> 30:56.523
-It's a great night, so, yeah.
-Sure. Yeah.

30:57.566 --> 30:58.901
Is it hot? It feels hot.

30:58.984 --> 31:00.861
Is it hot, or is it just me?

31:02.571 --> 31:04.031
Are you okay?

31:04.114 --> 31:07.242
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

31:11.788 --> 31:14.291
I guess I didn't pay extra for water.

31:15.626 --> 31:18.086
-But they'll be here eventually.
-Yeah.

31:20.214 --> 31:21.507
I love this song.

31:21.590 --> 31:24.051
-Me too. Such a good song.
-Right?

31:24.676 --> 31:27.387
Michael McDonald is vastly underrated.

31:27.471 --> 31:28.514
-Yeah.
-Totally.

31:28.597 --> 31:29.598
Wonderful artist.

31:29.681 --> 31:31.808
And I finally, I point up to my wife.

31:31.892 --> 31:34.228
I said, "Sorry, girls.
That's the milk factory.

31:34.311 --> 31:36.522
-This one's closed."
-Ike.

31:36.605 --> 31:38.565
-Too much.
-They're darling.

31:38.649 --> 31:39.775
Thank you.

31:39.858 --> 31:42.110
Where are you sending them
to school? Ramaz?

31:42.194 --> 31:44.905
Oh, God. I don't--
Barely even a month old.

31:44.988 --> 31:47.157
A month? Well, you should have had

31:47.241 --> 31:49.117
their references in
by the third trimester.

31:51.286 --> 31:53.163
Bonnie and I have actually talked
about Ramaz.

31:53.247 --> 31:55.832
-It's in our top five, actually.
-Oh, well it should be. Good.

31:55.916 --> 31:58.460
You could secure them a spot
if you brought out the old checkbook.

31:58.544 --> 32:01.421
Never hurts to slap a new coat of paint
on the library, hey, Ike?

32:03.215 --> 32:04.299
-That's a good point.
-Yeah.

32:04.883 --> 32:07.344
I keep forgettin'

32:08.303 --> 32:10.305
Everytime I hear

32:11.348 --> 32:16.019
How you never want to live a lie

32:18.522 --> 32:19.898
How it's gone too far

32:31.618 --> 32:35.873
You wouldn't wanna maybe,
I don't know, dance?

32:35.956 --> 32:38.584
Oh, no. No. No, thank you.

32:39.418 --> 32:40.419
Two left feet.

32:40.502 --> 32:43.338
Yeah. Okay.

32:43.839 --> 32:45.299
I keep forgettin'

32:47.217 --> 32:49.344
But if you wanna give it a go--

32:49.428 --> 32:52.097
-I'm happy to. Yeah.
-No, I don't.

32:52.181 --> 32:54.474
-If you don't want to--
-No, I want to if you want to.

32:54.558 --> 32:56.268
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

32:57.060 --> 32:59.897
I'll cover any medical costs
for crushed toes.

32:59.980 --> 33:01.773
Okay. Let's do this.

33:01.857 --> 33:03.275
-Great.
-Okay.

33:07.654 --> 33:08.822
It's over.

33:10.616 --> 33:11.700
Shoot.

33:12.326 --> 33:13.327
Oh, well.

33:14.828 --> 33:17.039
-I guess we missed it.
-Yeah.

33:19.124 --> 33:21.502
Hey, Dr. Ike. You're back.

33:21.585 --> 33:24.004
I'm back, and I'm famished.

33:24.087 --> 33:26.423
I heard they were serving the main course.
Enjoy, everyone.

33:26.965 --> 33:31.178
This prime rib cost me a thousand bucks
a plate, so you better put out after.

33:35.182 --> 33:38.602
Our next item up on the block
is a must-have

33:38.685 --> 33:41.104
for any New York sports fan.

33:41.188 --> 33:42.814
Hold on to your hats, folks.

33:42.898 --> 33:45.859
We have a game baseball
signed by Yankee legend

33:45.943 --> 33:47.819
Mickey Mantle himself.

33:51.198 --> 33:54.201
Marty. Mickey Mantle. It's a sign.

33:54.284 --> 33:55.869
I grew up loving Mickey Mantle.

33:55.953 --> 33:58.372
But didn't everybody
grow up loving Mickey Mantle?

33:58.455 --> 34:01.333
We could really put Yaron Foundation
on the map tonight.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.627
-Let's buy the ball.
-How does buying a baseball do that?

34:03.710 --> 34:05.504
By planting our flag.

34:05.587 --> 34:10.175
Announcing to the world how serious
Yaron is about helping people.

34:10.884 --> 34:13.929
We could really make a name
for ourselves tonight. You with me?

34:14.804 --> 34:16.889
I'm with you. Let's do it.

34:18.600 --> 34:22.603
Okay, so why don't we
start off the bidding at $500?

34:22.688 --> 34:23.856
Do I hear 500?

34:23.938 --> 34:25.023
500.

34:25.107 --> 34:27.109
-Thank you, sir.
-750.

34:27.192 --> 34:28.694
750. Thank you.

34:28.777 --> 34:30.237
-1,000.
-Okay.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.905
1,500.

34:31.989 --> 34:34.157
$1,500. Thank you, Mayor.

34:34.241 --> 34:37.119
Fuck, it's Mayor Koch.
Mayor Koch is bidding against us.

34:37.202 --> 34:39.580
-Is he even allowed to do that?
-3,000.

34:39.663 --> 34:40.956
Ike, slow down.

34:41.039 --> 34:42.791
We can find a less expensive baseball.

34:42.875 --> 34:45.002
Marty, look at us.
We're in this. We're in this.

34:45.085 --> 34:47.504
-3,000 going once…
-I'll bid $4,000.

34:47.588 --> 34:50.299
$4,000 from Mr. October.

34:50.382 --> 34:51.842
Is that Reggie Jackson?

34:51.925 --> 34:53.635
What's he doing bidding
on a Yankee baseball?

34:53.719 --> 34:56.471
He was a Yankee.
We can't let him get away with this.

34:57.598 --> 34:59.433
-5,000.
-5,500.

34:59.516 --> 35:00.601
6,000.

35:00.684 --> 35:02.769
Oh, my God.
My heart is pounding in my chest.

35:02.853 --> 35:03.896
7,000.

35:04.563 --> 35:06.565
Fuck you, Andy Warhol.
No way he even likes baseball.

35:06.648 --> 35:08.025
7,500.

35:08.108 --> 35:10.819
-8,000.
-Okay. Well, we gave it a good try.

35:11.403 --> 35:13.030
$20,000.

35:18.660 --> 35:19.953
10,000.

35:20.037 --> 35:23.040
-Sir, you can't go backwards.
-Why not? We meant ten.

35:23.123 --> 35:26.210
Sorry. 20,000. Going once.

35:26.293 --> 35:27.753
-Twice.
-All right.

35:27.836 --> 35:29.713
$12,000.

35:31.924 --> 35:33.342
$20,000.

35:33.425 --> 35:35.969
Sold to the gentlemen at table nine.

35:36.553 --> 35:39.473
The Yaron Foundation.

35:43.060 --> 35:45.312
Who wants a tequila shot? I'm buying.

35:45.395 --> 35:46.480
It's an open bar, sir.

35:48.607 --> 35:51.860
All right. Well, just set 'em up
and whoever wants can take.

35:52.611 --> 35:55.113
Tell me something, Dr. Herschkopf.
You ever played poker?

35:55.197 --> 35:58.200
Well, only about every chance I get.

35:59.368 --> 36:01.620
Me and some guys with
the organization play once a month.

36:01.703 --> 36:03.455
You wanna get in the game?

36:03.539 --> 36:04.831
Well, that depends.

36:05.958 --> 36:07.709
How do you feel about
losing all your money, champ?

36:13.090 --> 36:14.675
Marty, are you okay?

36:15.384 --> 36:17.970
That was a lot of money.

36:18.053 --> 36:19.054
I'm fine.

36:20.013 --> 36:21.890
-Thank you.
-Can I get you some water?

36:21.974 --> 36:23.183
-How about some water?
-No.

36:23.267 --> 36:25.227
-Do you want some water?
-No, no, no. Please.

36:25.310 --> 36:27.563
That's nice of you.

36:28.313 --> 36:30.274
-Yeah. I'm good.
-Okay. Okay.

36:31.984 --> 36:33.569
Actually, yes. Please.

36:33.652 --> 36:35.696
-Okay. All right.
-Would you mind? Is that all right?

36:35.779 --> 36:37.489
-I'll be right back, okay?
-Thanks.

36:49.626 --> 36:51.753
Excuse me, could I have
a glass of water, please?

36:51.837 --> 36:54.798
Hannah! Banana fofana.

36:54.882 --> 36:55.924
Dr. Ike.

36:57.301 --> 36:59.553
Help yourself to a tequila shot.

37:00.721 --> 37:02.389
I don't-- No. No, thanks.

37:02.472 --> 37:04.516
-Yeah. I--
-Okay, well, suit yourself.

37:04.600 --> 37:08.395
Where's Marty? Shouldn't you two
be out on the dance floor? Boogie?

37:09.229 --> 37:11.940
Yeah, you know what? He's actually--
He's not feeling great.

37:12.024 --> 37:14.860
-So I'm getting him some water 'cause--
-Oh, no. What's wrong with him?

37:16.695 --> 37:17.821
Well…

37:19.531 --> 37:22.492
To be honest,
I think he's a little freaked out

37:22.576 --> 37:26.580
about how much of his money
you spent on a baseball.

37:28.207 --> 37:29.208
His money?

37:31.168 --> 37:32.169
His money?

37:34.505 --> 37:35.506
That's what he said?

37:35.589 --> 37:37.841
Hannah, you don't know
what you're talking about.

37:37.925 --> 37:39.301
Where is he? I wanna…

37:39.384 --> 37:40.928
He's sitting…

37:41.011 --> 37:42.513
-He's sitting down. But--
-I'll be right--

37:42.596 --> 37:43.680
-I--
-No, no.

37:50.729 --> 37:52.481
Taxi-- Ta--

37:53.899 --> 37:56.235
Marty! Where are you going?
We need to talk.

37:56.318 --> 37:57.861
I'm not feeling so hot, Ike.

37:57.945 --> 38:01.240
Can you make sure
that Hannah gets home okay?

38:01.323 --> 38:03.033
-You okay, buddy?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:03.116 --> 38:06.703
I'm just having one of my panic attacks.
I just need to get home. It'll pass.

38:06.787 --> 38:09.122
-Okay, I can't let you do that, Marty.
-No, no, no.

38:09.206 --> 38:11.083
-You're not well.
-I don't want any fuss.

38:11.166 --> 38:13.585
-I think we should go to the hospital.
-No. No, no, no.

38:13.669 --> 38:15.337
-Yes.
-I just have a little dizziness,

38:15.963 --> 38:18.006
-shortness of breath…
-Listen. Listen to me.

38:18.090 --> 38:19.341
-…tightness in my chest.
-Listen.

38:19.424 --> 38:21.134
I think you might be having
a heart attack.

38:22.094 --> 38:23.595
You go back inside and enjoy yourself.

38:23.679 --> 38:25.347
-No. Come here.
-I don't want anyone…

38:25.430 --> 38:28.058
We're gonna get you to the hospital.
We're going to the hospital.

38:28.141 --> 38:29.768
We're going to the hospital.

38:31.895 --> 38:32.938
That's it.

38:36.692 --> 38:37.776
You'll be all right.

38:38.443 --> 38:39.903
Yeah, yeah. It's okay.

38:39.987 --> 38:43.240
You relax. You'll be fine. You'll be okay.
No, no, no. It's all right.

38:43.323 --> 38:46.159
Relax. Just breathe.

38:53.250 --> 38:57.254
I can leave a note in this plain envelope
saying, "You're through, loser."

38:58.630 --> 39:00.090
That's the nice way.

39:01.258 --> 39:02.259
Or…

39:05.554 --> 39:06.597
How's my favorite patient?

39:06.680 --> 39:09.516
-Dr. Ike. You're back again.
-Of course.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.268
I'm worried about you.

39:12.102 --> 39:14.855
What a treat. Look at those.
That's fun.

39:14.938 --> 39:16.523
It's the least I could do.

39:18.567 --> 39:19.568
Marty…

39:20.819 --> 39:22.779
I owe you an apology.

39:22.863 --> 39:25.782
I'm sorry I got carried away
at the auction last night.

39:25.866 --> 39:28.827
Are you kidding me, Dr. Ike?
You saved my life.

39:28.911 --> 39:31.496
-Marty, please.
-No, I'm serious.

39:31.580 --> 39:33.832
Had I gotten in that cab and gone home,

39:35.792 --> 39:36.835
I would have--

39:40.589 --> 39:43.300
And no one would have been around
to find me.

39:46.887 --> 39:48.764
Cats would have eaten my face.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.685
-You don't have a cat.
-No, I know.

39:53.769 --> 39:55.521
It's just, without you…

40:02.194 --> 40:03.237
Hey.

40:04.363 --> 40:05.405
I'm right here.

40:06.573 --> 40:08.033
I'll always be here.

40:09.368 --> 40:10.661
I'll look after you.

40:14.248 --> 40:15.749
Thank you.

40:18.877 --> 40:19.962
Okay.

40:22.673 --> 40:24.383
I better let you get some rest.

40:25.384 --> 40:27.052
See you in session next week?

40:27.135 --> 40:28.470
Looking forward to it.

40:32.933 --> 40:36.353
Those are from Hannah.
Isn't that nice?

40:37.896 --> 40:38.897
Very nice.

40:38.981 --> 40:40.983
Do you think they're "get well" flowers

40:41.066 --> 40:44.444
or "ask me out on another date" flowers?

40:45.654 --> 40:47.030
Hard to say.

40:47.114 --> 40:49.241
I felt like I blew it last night.
Did I blow it?

40:49.324 --> 40:51.535
Hope I didn't blow it,
'cause this may sound crazy,

40:51.618 --> 40:52.995
but maybe there's a future there.

40:53.078 --> 40:56.665
It's like you said,
maybe my legacy is yet to be written.

40:56.748 --> 40:59.001
Marty, it was only one date.

40:59.084 --> 41:00.878
Maybe you shouldn't get
so ahead of yourself.

41:00.961 --> 41:02.838
No. No, I know. I just…

41:04.381 --> 41:06.216
I really like her,

41:06.300 --> 41:09.595
and I just don't know
how she feels about me.

41:10.762 --> 41:12.014
Want me to talk to her?

41:13.098 --> 41:15.100
You would do that for me, Dr. Ike?

41:15.184 --> 41:18.270
Of course. I'd do anything for you.

41:22.816 --> 41:23.942
Great.

41:28.697 --> 41:29.823
-Ike.
-Hannah.

41:29.907 --> 41:32.618
Hey. How is Marty?

41:32.701 --> 41:34.620
Better. Much better.

41:35.329 --> 41:36.371
Great.

41:36.455 --> 41:38.373
Yeah, he gave us quite a scare, didn't he?

41:38.457 --> 41:39.666
Yeah, he really--

41:40.667 --> 41:41.668
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

41:41.752 --> 41:43.128
I'm glad he's okay.

41:43.212 --> 41:46.548
Well, between you and me…

41:48.467 --> 41:51.929
I feel awful about what happened to him.

41:52.012 --> 41:53.639
I blame myself.

41:55.098 --> 41:56.517
-You do?
-I do.

41:58.560 --> 42:01.688
As his therapist and as his friend,

42:03.190 --> 42:05.400
I never should have pushed him so hard.

42:05.984 --> 42:07.444
He's not a healthy man.

42:10.864 --> 42:12.032
Look, Hannah.

42:13.909 --> 42:16.370
Do you care about Marty?

42:17.329 --> 42:19.373
Well, yeah, of course.

42:19.456 --> 42:21.458
And you want what's best for him?

42:21.542 --> 42:23.502
-Yes.
-Good, good.

42:24.378 --> 42:25.379
Me too.

42:26.255 --> 42:30.801
And believe me, this is just
as disappointing for me as it is for you.

42:31.802 --> 42:35.389
But I think it's imperative
that we do what's best for Marty,

42:35.472 --> 42:37.641
however painful it might be.

42:41.103 --> 42:42.729
You understand what I'm saying?

42:51.655 --> 42:52.990
How was your day, hon?

42:53.073 --> 42:55.117
Hey, long.

42:55.200 --> 42:58.245
Any of that pastrami left,
or did Anita eat it all?

42:58.328 --> 43:01.582
Again, she speaks English
and has full hearing capabilities.

43:02.165 --> 43:03.166
Don't listen to him.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.626
Besides, you ordered so much food,

43:04.710 --> 43:07.087
we'll still be serving it
at the girls' graduation.

43:08.255 --> 43:11.216
Speaking of which, I just got them
into the Ramaz school.

43:11.800 --> 43:12.801
All taken care of.

43:12.885 --> 43:15.053
Ramaz? How'd you manage that?

43:15.137 --> 43:17.931
Let's just say I made them
a generous donation.

43:18.015 --> 43:20.017
Ike. Honey, how much?

43:20.100 --> 43:22.019
I wish you'd talked to me about it first.

43:22.102 --> 43:24.605
Relax. I used my own money.
