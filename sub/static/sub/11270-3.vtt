00:22.040 --> 00:22.906
OK.

00:23.041 --> 00:25.616
Shot of bourbon. Beer chaser.

00:25.754 --> 00:29.800
Bloody Mary without Tabasco,
and with extra Tabasco.

00:29.926 --> 00:33.463
Coffee. Cream. Sugar. Sweet'N Low.

00:33.598 --> 00:36.470
CC water back. Pretzels.

00:36.602 --> 00:40.436
Pitcher of water with three glasses.

00:42.736 --> 00:45.228
Those are our drinks.

00:50.038 --> 00:51.913
I'm terribly sorry.

00:53.627 --> 00:59.668
I don't suppose I could impose upon
you people to save me a few steps?

01:03.307 --> 01:07.141
Thanks. Thank you, really.
Thanks so much.

01:07.271 --> 01:09.846
Free pretzels for everybody.

02:29.054 --> 02:31.178
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

02:31.307 --> 02:32.683
Norman.

02:33.686 --> 02:36.392
- Beer, Norm?
- I've heard of that stuff.

02:36.523 --> 02:39.098
Better give me a tall one
in case I like it.

02:40.070 --> 02:44.235
- Another day, another dollar.
- 50 cents after taxes.

02:44.368 --> 02:46.990
- Hey, Norm.
- Hey, girl. How's the kids?

02:47.121 --> 02:50.788
Two of them are ugly, one's obnoxious
and one's just stupid.

02:50.919 --> 02:52.378
He's my favourite.

02:58.012 --> 03:03.685
- Get me Gus.
- Yes, sir. Right away. Gus who?

03:03.812 --> 03:05.936
Don't be a wise guy. Just get him.

03:06.065 --> 03:11.062
Alright, yes, sir.
Norm, do you know a Gus?

03:11.197 --> 03:15.411
- Gus who?
- He hates that question.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.540
Gus, the owner of this bar.

03:20.669 --> 03:25.629
I know who you mean.
That was two owners ago.

03:25.760 --> 03:29.806
I'll never forget that guy.
He had such a great name. Gus.

03:30.642 --> 03:34.178
I came from Seattle to talk to him.
Gus is the man.

03:34.314 --> 03:37.850
You got troubles, you take 'em
to Gus, he straightens you up.

03:37.986 --> 03:41.190
I've gotta be back in Seattle
Thursday night.

03:41.324 --> 03:43.364
Take it easy.

03:43.493 --> 03:49.119
Listen, I managed in the minors,
I coached in the majors,

03:49.252 --> 03:51.625
I've been a bartender for five years.

03:51.755 --> 03:54.294
I've had my share
of people with problems.

03:54.467 --> 03:55.796
Why not give me a try?

03:58.473 --> 04:03.102
My son comes home from college
with his new fiancé, who's black.

04:03.731 --> 04:05.771
And your son's not?

04:10.448 --> 04:11.480
Yo, Coach.

04:12.743 --> 04:14.119
Get Gus.

04:16.165 --> 04:17.363
I'll make a few calls.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.620
Good idea. Give me a Scotch.
I'll be right back.

04:21.798 --> 04:24.586
- Holy... !
- What's the matter, Norm?

04:24.719 --> 04:27.507
Somebody pinch me.
I've got to be hallucinating.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.803
Look at those legs!

04:28.933 --> 04:33.562
If they're attached to anything,
even a truck, I'm gonna marry it.

04:33.690 --> 04:37.820
Please come down here. Please.
She's coming down here!

04:38.947 --> 04:41.653
Alright, everybody, just act natural.

04:41.785 --> 04:43.529
This I gotta see.

04:43.913 --> 04:48.541
I don't believe this. I feel like
I've been transported in time

04:48.669 --> 04:51.162
back to a fraternity house
in the '50s.

04:51.298 --> 04:57.422
Come on, guys. In this day and age,
aren't we beyond ogling women?

04:57.557 --> 04:59.266
Holy... !

05:01.187 --> 05:03.810
Norm, is that the one?

05:07.238 --> 05:09.148
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:10.117 --> 05:11.777
Excuse me, miss.

05:11.911 --> 05:16.705
The gentleman at the end of the bar
would like to buy you an automobile.

05:21.967 --> 05:24.803
- May I help you?
- White wine, please.

05:24.929 --> 05:29.178
- White wine.
- Here, allow me. I got it.

05:34.568 --> 05:38.437
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

05:41.495 --> 05:43.405
Don't get your hopes up, boys.

05:43.539 --> 05:47.870
As soon as Sam comes out here,
it's dinner for two at his place.

05:48.672 --> 05:50.297
Come on.

05:50.424 --> 05:54.126
I hardly think that's the sort
of woman Sam would go out with.

05:54.263 --> 05:58.179
Listen, she may not
be flashy enough for Sammy.

05:59.020 --> 06:02.355
They had Sammy in mind
when they built her.

06:02.483 --> 06:05.853
Really? I don't buy that.

06:05.988 --> 06:08.527
I know I've only worked here
a short time,

06:08.658 --> 06:11.910
but it seems to me
Sam has more depth than that.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.242
Follow me.

06:21.343 --> 06:23.337
Sam, would you come here a second?

06:23.471 --> 06:27.305
Carla, never disturb me...
unless there's a customer.

06:29.313 --> 06:34.024
No, don't drink that.
I've got something much better.

06:35.321 --> 06:39.403
I think you're gonna like this.
It's an amusing little wine.

06:39.536 --> 06:41.328
You like to laugh?

06:41.455 --> 06:45.585
- I love to laugh. How did you know?
- Call it a hunch.

06:46.295 --> 06:49.666
The great ones make it look so easy.

06:50.593 --> 06:54.806
Is there chance that you and I could
go someplace and laugh together?

06:56.560 --> 06:59.515
My mother told me
to watch out for guys in bars.

06:59.648 --> 07:03.729
Well then, let's get out of this bar
so you don't have to worry.

07:04.446 --> 07:06.736
I do feel like a movie tonight.

07:06.866 --> 07:10.568
I've been in the mood
for a movie all day long.

07:11.206 --> 07:15.122
- What kind of movie shall we see?
- Something short.

07:23.682 --> 07:25.971
Could you be a little more specific?

07:26.102 --> 07:28.142
Does anybody know any good movies?

07:28.272 --> 07:31.143
What's that new Australian film
that's good?

07:31.276 --> 07:34.812
No. No Australian films.
I hate subtitles.

07:38.828 --> 07:40.905
This one's no problem. It's dubbed.

07:43.627 --> 07:44.872
Will you excuse me?

07:45.004 --> 07:48.291
Diane, can I talk to you
in the poolroom?

07:48.425 --> 07:49.801
Sure.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.883
I'll be right back. What's your name?

07:53.432 --> 07:57.302
Brandee. With two Es.

08:06.159 --> 08:08.283
Brandee with two Es?

08:08.412 --> 08:11.829
A big company like this,
they spelled it wrong.

08:16.841 --> 08:20.425
- OK, what was that all about?
- What was what all about?

08:20.554 --> 08:23.260
All that laughing and stuff?

08:23.392 --> 08:25.516
"I love to laugh."

08:27.064 --> 08:29.437
- Diane, can we have two beers?
- Coming up.

08:29.567 --> 08:33.020
- No. Not right now.
- Sam, we're thirsty.

08:33.155 --> 08:34.900
Drink chalk.

08:36.910 --> 08:42.916
Sam, I didn't mean anything by that.
I laughed. Life is funny.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.421
Correct me if I'm wrong,

08:44.547 --> 08:48.000
but I get the impression
that you don't approve of Brandee.

08:48.135 --> 08:51.091
Is that Brandy with a Y or two Es?

08:52.600 --> 08:57.098
I may be the dim ex-baseball player
and you're the postgraduate,

08:57.232 --> 08:59.984
but I'm the boss
and I didn't hire you as a critic,

09:00.111 --> 09:03.612
- I hired you as a waitress.
- You'd never know it by me.

09:05.493 --> 09:07.570
Beer. With two Es.

09:11.418 --> 09:14.789
Will you guys just sit down
for a minute, please?

09:16.676 --> 09:18.219
Thank you.

09:18.971 --> 09:22.756
Why don't you be honest with me?
You think Brandee's dumb.

09:22.893 --> 09:26.180
- I never said that.
- But you think she's dumb.

09:26.315 --> 09:31.738
- I don't know that I think that.
- Diane, she's a tree stump. Come on.

09:32.490 --> 09:35.065
I guess she'll do
until dumb comes along.

09:35.202 --> 09:37.160
Well, thank you very much.

09:37.289 --> 09:40.326
The truth comes out.
She's a total airhead.

09:40.460 --> 09:43.545
- Incredible body, no mind.
- Who?

09:44.966 --> 09:46.509
I don't think that.

09:46.635 --> 09:49.210
To you, Brandee's a one-night woman.

09:49.347 --> 09:52.884
Built for cheap laughs,
wild times and easy sex.

09:53.019 --> 09:56.390
- Where?
- Will you just admit it?

09:56.524 --> 10:00.855
Sam, I've got a message for you.
Your date, Miss Bigbuckets?

10:00.989 --> 10:04.157
She told me to tell you
she's getting a little "ootsy".

10:05.954 --> 10:10.120
Get her out. The customers are
warping the wood with their drool.

10:15.176 --> 10:18.095
- Diane, come here. Listen...
- Wait a minute.

10:18.222 --> 10:19.966
I don't mean to criticise.

10:21.018 --> 10:24.055
In a way, I was complimenting you.
You can do better.

10:24.189 --> 10:26.229
I don't want to do better.

10:26.358 --> 10:29.978
There are certain things in this life
that I really like,

10:30.114 --> 10:32.487
and nobody's gonna change my mind.

10:32.617 --> 10:36.617
I like fun women,
hot dogs, game shows.

10:36.748 --> 10:38.409
I don't care what anybody says.

10:38.542 --> 10:40.916
Did you read
they found rat parts in hot dogs?

10:41.046 --> 10:44.630
I like rat parts. It's my
favourite part of the hot dog.

10:45.594 --> 10:47.006
OK.

10:48.682 --> 10:51.139
And one more thing I like. Brandee.

10:51.269 --> 10:54.520
I sensed something very special
going on there.

10:54.649 --> 10:59.229
So if you'll excuse me, that very
special somebody is waiting for me.

10:59.364 --> 11:00.859
Fine.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.367
- Coach?
- Yeah?

11:08.335 --> 11:11.254
- Where's Brandee?
- She just left with some guy.

11:11.381 --> 11:15.677
- She what?
- Looked like the real thing, Sam.

11:18.099 --> 11:21.718
If I see one sign that you're
enjoying this, you're in trouble.

11:24.483 --> 11:27.770
How about a couple of beers
for the boys in the poolroom?

11:28.906 --> 11:30.282
OK.

11:48.183 --> 11:49.762
Another beer, Norm?

11:50.603 --> 11:53.724
Yeah. One quick one
and then it's <i>adios</i> for sure.

11:57.029 --> 11:59.865
Here you go. No, it's a guy.

12:03.038 --> 12:06.159
Coach, any word from Gus yet?

12:06.292 --> 12:10.506
Yeah, Leo.
He can't drop by tonight. He's dead.

12:13.135 --> 12:16.091
- Oh, no.
- Leo, it happens.

12:16.223 --> 12:19.142
I can't believe it. Gus is gone?

12:20.229 --> 12:24.311
Nobody can replace Gus.
Gus had all the answers.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.271
All but one.

12:29.534 --> 12:33.747
- What am I gonna do without Gus?
- Leo, will you stop it?

12:33.873 --> 12:38.703
Ever since you came through
that door, it's been Gus, Gus, Gus.

12:38.839 --> 12:42.672
I mean, it's Gus this and Gus that,
and I'm fed up with it.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.721
I'm taking you on.
You and all your problems.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.807
- Come on, sit down.
- I don't know.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.679
Sit, Leo.

12:50.898 --> 12:52.178
Sit!

12:56.531 --> 12:58.489
Throw your problems on the bar.

12:58.617 --> 13:01.654
- Come on, give him a chance.
- He's ready for you.

13:01.788 --> 13:03.616
Nothing to be afraid of.

13:04.166 --> 13:09.127
My son comes home from college
with his new fiancé, who's black.

13:09.257 --> 13:12.758
I thought about that. It's a tough
one, but I think I've got it.

13:12.971 --> 13:16.673
- Wait a minute cos there's more.
- No, hold it, Leo.

13:16.809 --> 13:20.476
Leo, it's a problem
of communication.

13:20.982 --> 13:23.308
Here's what you do,
when you get home,

13:23.444 --> 13:26.612
you sit the kids down
and say to your boy...

13:26.740 --> 13:29.493
- What's your boy's name?
- Ron.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.995
What's Ron's fiancé's name?

13:32.123 --> 13:36.169
- Rick.
- Rick. So, you say...

13:37.506 --> 13:40.461
You say, "Rick, Ron..."

13:41.344 --> 13:42.590
Rick and Ron?

13:47.937 --> 13:51.723
Suck it up, Coachie.
Hang tough in there.

13:53.612 --> 13:55.023
Leo...

13:56.115 --> 14:00.411
Leo, if you're that unhappy about it,
just throw him out

14:00.538 --> 14:03.030
and tell him you never want
to see him again.

14:03.167 --> 14:05.624
I can't do that. I love the kid.

14:07.006 --> 14:10.210
- I see what you're saying.
- You do? What?

14:11.429 --> 14:14.882
If I can't accept the kid
the way he is, I'll lose him.

14:15.017 --> 14:16.975
Boy, that's good.

14:18.856 --> 14:21.728
When you put it that way,
what choice do I have?

14:21.860 --> 14:24.816
Thanks, Coach.
You're not Gus, but you're not bad.

14:25.574 --> 14:28.695
Leo, even Gus isn't Gus any more.

14:30.623 --> 14:33.079
- Thanks, Coach.
- Alright, Coach!

14:35.004 --> 14:36.499
Alright, Coach.

14:37.007 --> 14:39.499
You got him. You really took him.

14:39.636 --> 14:42.128
Took him? I had him for breakfast.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.342
Coach, where's Sammy?

14:45.728 --> 14:47.520
Out, where else?

14:47.647 --> 14:51.812
Again? He's been out
with a different dolly every night.

14:51.945 --> 14:55.315
He's overcompensating
for feelings of inadequacy

14:55.450 --> 14:58.701
with an ostentatious display
of hormonal activity.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.372
That's our Sammy.

15:01.792 --> 15:04.035
Let me tell you something.

15:04.171 --> 15:07.173
There are drawbacks
to dating beautiful women.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.128
Yeah? Like what?

15:09.261 --> 15:12.382
You can't eat ltalian
cos always they're on diets.

15:12.516 --> 15:16.052
You can't go outside
cos the wind will muss their hair.

15:16.188 --> 15:18.228
You can't go to hockey games

15:18.357 --> 15:21.858
cos they might get hit
in the face with a puck.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.147
Where's the fun?

15:24.282 --> 15:26.656
Carla, the fun's in the fun.

15:27.495 --> 15:30.284
Yes. Unlimited sex.

15:30.416 --> 15:33.869
The adult male's version
of owning a candy store.

15:34.839 --> 15:38.839
But tell me, once you've consumed
as much sex

15:38.970 --> 15:42.008
for as long as you want it,
what would you do then?

15:45.438 --> 15:47.431
I'd help the poor.

15:55.076 --> 15:57.533
- I can't stay long.
- One drink.

15:58.289 --> 16:00.117
The man's got a harem.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.789
- You all know Debra.
- Hi, Coach. Hi, guys.

16:04.423 --> 16:08.374
Diane, this is Debra.
Debra, this is Diane.

16:08.512 --> 16:09.841
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:09.973 --> 16:11.052
Debra.

16:12.810 --> 16:15.896
- What are you drinking?
- A very dry martini.

16:16.023 --> 16:20.853
That's a very classy order.
We're gonna have a very dry martini.

16:21.572 --> 16:23.115
Nothing for me.

16:23.241 --> 16:29.080
We just back from Symphony Hall.
Heard Mozart's <i>Symphony No.41.</i>

16:29.208 --> 16:31.914
Sometimes called
the <i>Jupiter Symphony.</i>

16:32.046 --> 16:33.754
Debra's idea.

16:33.882 --> 16:37.798
I haven't heard a lot
of classical music, but I like it.

16:38.346 --> 16:42.677
What was that comment
you made in the intermission?

16:42.811 --> 16:44.721
"Give me a cigarette"?

16:46.066 --> 16:50.279
Not that one.
The smart one about the music.

16:51.406 --> 16:54.693
Yeah. I said, "It's hard
to believe that all that music

16:54.828 --> 16:56.905
could come out of one man's head."

16:57.039 --> 16:59.614
- "One man's head."
- I heard.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.792
Where else could it come out of?

17:03.006 --> 17:06.626
I read in the programme
that Mozart died when he was 35.

17:06.762 --> 17:09.930
Imagine writing all that music
before you're 35.

17:10.058 --> 17:13.179
Slow down. You're giving us
too much to think about.

17:17.151 --> 17:19.310
I have got to be going somewhere.

17:19.445 --> 17:22.483
Just as well. Our heads are spinning.

17:22.617 --> 17:25.454
Wait. Debra,
you forgot your programme.

17:25.579 --> 17:27.869
- Thank you.
- I love Mozart, too.

17:29.878 --> 17:33.628
- This programme's two years old.
- Is it?

17:34.551 --> 17:35.666
Yes.

17:38.807 --> 17:43.186
Well then, Mozart must have been
37 years old when he died.

17:45.108 --> 17:48.443
I didn't say
we came straight from the concert.

17:50.532 --> 17:54.662
OK, we went to see <i>Star Wars</i> again
and I'm glad.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.831
- How did I do?
- Well...

18:02.424 --> 18:04.168
Thanks.

18:09.184 --> 18:11.640
- Don't.
- Fine.

18:11.771 --> 18:13.480
I'm gonna play pool.

18:20.659 --> 18:21.857
Carla?

18:22.661 --> 18:24.904
You've known Sam a long time.

18:25.040 --> 18:28.410
Has he ever had a relationship
with an intelligent woman?

18:29.212 --> 18:31.004
That's the best I've seen.

18:31.883 --> 18:36.381
- What about his ex-wife?
- That was his ex-wife.

18:41.981 --> 18:44.733
I'm gonna go back there
and talk to him.

18:46.529 --> 18:51.193
"Blonde Chick
Dies in Billiard Accident."

18:54.415 --> 18:57.750
- Sam?
- Go away. I'm reading Plato.

19:00.298 --> 19:04.464
- May I speak with you for a moment?
- No.

19:05.556 --> 19:08.474
I came in to cheer you up a little.

19:09.436 --> 19:11.560
I know why you brought Debra here.

19:11.689 --> 19:14.312
You're trying to prove
you date smart women.

19:14.443 --> 19:17.730
No, I brought Debra here
for a drink. This is a bar.

19:17.865 --> 19:18.814
Come on.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.534
- No, it's a bar. Is this a bar?
- Yes.

19:23.790 --> 19:25.368
Excuse me.

19:29.048 --> 19:31.718
I sense that you're unhappy
right now.

19:31.843 --> 19:35.011
Unhappy? I'm not unhappy.
I'm on top of the world.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.385
What a life I lead.

19:36.516 --> 19:40.432
Tomorrow, I'm going out with
a girl who wears a pinwheel hat.

19:42.191 --> 19:45.028
Would you stop making jokes
and talk to me?

19:47.115 --> 19:50.366
OK, I'm all cheered up now.
You can leave. Thanks.

19:51.997 --> 19:54.240
Why are you so upset?

19:57.922 --> 20:01.292
This week, I have gone out
with all the women I know.

20:01.427 --> 20:04.097
All the women I really enjoy.

20:04.223 --> 20:08.222
All of a sudden, all I can
think about is how stupid they are.

20:08.353 --> 20:13.231
My life isn't fun any more,
and it's because of you.

20:14.988 --> 20:18.857
- Because of me?
- Yeah. You're a snob.

20:20.955 --> 20:23.992
- A snob?
- Yeah, that's right.

20:25.294 --> 20:28.961
Well, you're a rapidly ageing
adolescent.

20:29.717 --> 20:32.636
Well, I would rather be that
than a snob.

20:32.763 --> 20:37.344
- And I would rather be a snob.
- Well, good, because you are.

20:37.478 --> 20:41.857
Do yourself a favour. Go back
to your tootsies and your rat parts.

20:41.985 --> 20:45.485
I'd hate to see the bowling alleys
close on my account.

20:45.615 --> 20:46.991
Wait a minute.

20:47.117 --> 20:51.068
Are you saying that
I'm too dumb to date smart women?

20:51.206 --> 20:54.458
I'm saying that
it would be very difficult for you.

20:54.586 --> 20:58.585
A really intelligent woman would see
your line of BS a mile away.

20:58.717 --> 21:00.627
You think so?

21:01.638 --> 21:06.598
Well, I've never met an intelligent
woman that I'd want to date.

21:07.187 --> 21:12.314
On behalf of the intelligent women
around the world, may I just say...

21:18.453 --> 21:20.032
Well, come on.

21:20.164 --> 21:23.083
Wait. It depends
what kind we're talking about.

21:23.210 --> 21:25.203
- Just the average.
- Any kind.

21:25.338 --> 21:30.132
You take your average whale's
intestines and stretch 'em out,

21:30.262 --> 21:32.932
you're looking at three miles
and change.

21:33.975 --> 21:35.885
You win again, Coach.

21:36.020 --> 21:38.975
This man knows his animal kingdom.

21:41.277 --> 21:42.772
It's getting late.

21:44.282 --> 21:48.411
It's about time this old cowpoke
moseyed off to the bathroom.

21:56.507 --> 22:00.293
Black Label over, Bloody Mary,
a shot of vodka.

22:02.599 --> 22:05.970
Look, I am sorry.
I said a lot of stupid things.

22:06.104 --> 22:11.314
I shouldn't have. I apologise.
I was kind of upset.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.993
OK, I'm sorry, too.

22:19.290 --> 22:21.580
We both got a little carried away.

22:22.085 --> 22:23.545
Especially you.

22:28.803 --> 22:32.672
- Well, I'll be darned.
- What?

22:32.809 --> 22:36.678
- Nothing. I just noticed something.
- What?

22:37.524 --> 22:40.895
I guess
I've never looked into your eyes.

22:42.072 --> 22:44.149
Something wrong with them?

22:44.284 --> 22:49.114
No. I just don't think I've ever seen
eyes that colour before.

22:50.084 --> 22:53.953
Matter of fact, I don't think
I've ever seen that colour before.

22:55.425 --> 22:56.919
Yes, I have.

22:59.722 --> 23:01.182
Where?

23:02.017 --> 23:06.598
I was on a ski weekend
up at Stowe.

23:07.650 --> 23:10.107
I was coming in late one day,

23:10.237 --> 23:14.735
last person off the slope
as the sun had just gone down.

23:14.869 --> 23:17.955
The sky became
this incredible colour.

23:18.749 --> 23:21.288
I usually don't notice
things like that,

23:21.420 --> 23:24.339
and I found myself walking
around in the cold,

23:24.841 --> 23:27.594
hoping that it wouldn't change,

23:27.721 --> 23:31.471
wishing that I had somebody there
to share it with.

23:31.601 --> 23:36.312
Afterwards, I tried to convince
myself that I'd imagined that colour,

23:36.441 --> 23:37.817
that I hadn't seen it,

23:37.943 --> 23:41.646
that nothing on this earth
could be that beautiful.

23:42.617 --> 23:44.444
Now I see I was wrong.

23:50.712 --> 23:52.420
Wouldn't work?

23:54.926 --> 23:56.171
What?

23:56.971 --> 24:00.056
An intelligent woman
would see right through that.

24:05.608 --> 24:07.566
In a minute.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.064
Damn.
