WEBVTT

00:01.860 --> 00:04.397
Previously on The Good Wife:
I had more to release about
your husband-- a lot more.

00:04.430 --> 00:07.467
Disturbing things.
I was holding back.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.398
GRACE:
Do we tell Mom?

00:08.440 --> 00:11.068
They sent them
to hurt her, so I say no.

00:11.110 --> 00:12.805
_ You're three months
Into a ten-year sentence,

00:12.840 --> 00:13.807
and you're plotting
a political comeback.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.139
Politics is just a game
of Chutes and Ladders.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.147
Alicia, um, we...

00:18.180 --> 00:19.772
(clears throat)
...we need you

00:19.820 --> 00:21.515
to do something
that we didn't expect.

00:21.550 --> 00:23.142
Will you testify?

00:27.820 --> 00:31.051
(door opens, closes)

00:32.660 --> 00:34.093
MAN:
Mrs. Florrick?

00:40.240 --> 00:42.162
Sorry to keep you
waiting.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.734
We had to move them.

00:48.510 --> 00:52.310
I put them in the
jury holding room.

00:52.350 --> 00:53.476
PETER:
It's humbling.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.114
I've sent people
to prison,

00:56.150 --> 00:58.141
a lot of people,
actually,

00:58.190 --> 01:00.112
and I'd do it again.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.628
But I do wish that
every prosecutor

01:02.660 --> 01:06.653
had my experience
of walking in a convict's shoes.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.826
Well, you must've

01:07.860 --> 01:10.124
seen the articles
or heard the rumblings.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.125
With crime rates up

01:11.170 --> 01:13.229
and disappointment
in your successor rising,

01:13.270 --> 01:15.488
the voters seem
to want you back.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.167
(chuckles)

01:17.210 --> 01:18.859
Well, Russ,
I'll always remember

01:18.910 --> 01:20.707
what my dad told me.

01:20.740 --> 01:23.743
And he said, "If you're ever
granted a second act in life,

01:23.780 --> 01:25.577
don't repeat the first one."

01:25.610 --> 01:28.738
So as gratified as I am
by all the talk, I think...

01:30.520 --> 01:32.852
I think that's all it is: talk.

01:32.890 --> 01:35.484
So, then, what's next
for Peter Florrick?

01:35.520 --> 01:37.181
I've got to go into
that courtroom

01:37.230 --> 01:38.424
in the next few weeks

01:38.460 --> 01:39.893
and win this appeal.

01:39.930 --> 01:41.818
That's not gonna be easy.

01:41.860 --> 01:43.862
I have a family--

01:43.900 --> 01:47.267
a wife who's been nothing
short of amazing,

01:47.300 --> 01:50.201
two kids-- strength
through all of this.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.401
I'm very proud of them.
I promised

01:52.440 --> 01:54.374
to address the elephant
in the room,

01:54.410 --> 01:55.832
and so I have
to do that now.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.769
What drove you
to seek prostitutes

01:58.810 --> 02:00.209
when you know
it could put

02:00.250 --> 02:02.548
your life and your
career in so much danger?

02:02.590 --> 02:04.683
I'm a flawed human being.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.915
And, uh...

02:06.960 --> 02:09.155
and I've paid a heaw price.

02:09.190 --> 02:10.680
I'm not complaining.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.197
That's just the truth.

02:12.230 --> 02:15.324
But I've looked in the mirror,

02:15.360 --> 02:17.294
and what I've seen,
I don't like.

02:17.330 --> 02:20.197
And I'm gonna
changeit

02:23.310 --> 02:27.474
That said, I do think
it's time to turn the page,

02:27.510 --> 02:30.172
look to the future.

02:34.250 --> 02:34.875
Thanks, love.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.343
Oh, God, you smell good.

02:37.390 --> 02:38.448
How'd it go?

02:38.490 --> 02:40.583
Good, I think.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.224
It was kinda weird.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.818
Oh, by the way,
this is Kya Poole,

02:43.860 --> 02:46.351
LLC Consultants.
She's a reputation manager.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.324
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.
I have a lot of respect for you.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.962
Thank you.
Thanks.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.194
Hope it fits.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.867
Prison fare takes its toll.

02:57.710 --> 03:00.679
That's the look
the public misses:

03:00.710 --> 03:02.803
confident, real, optimistic.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.704
Know what he was talking about
at that moment?

03:05.980 --> 03:08.175
You.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.547
I have to go.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.455
Stern, Lockhart
& Gardner, right?
Yes.

03:13.490 --> 03:14.684
Say hello to Will.

03:16.260 --> 03:18.285
Hey, you'll drop by
later, right?

03:18.330 --> 03:19.854
Yeah, I'll stop by
after work.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.049
Good.

03:21.100 --> 03:24.365
WOMAN: I'm sor-sorry.
What was the question again?

03:24.400 --> 03:26.334
TAMARA: You work at
Chicago Polytech,

03:26.370 --> 03:28.634
isn't that correct,
Professor Whitton?

03:28.670 --> 03:31.230
Yes. I, um, uh...

03:31.270 --> 03:34.433
I received a grant to research
cellular reproduction...

03:34.480 --> 03:37.699
I'm sorry, cellular reproduction
in pluripotent stem cells.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.014
TAMARA: _
More commonly known as cloning?

03:40.050 --> 03:41.870
WHI'I'I'ON: Yes, I-I'm sorry.
Yes, cloning.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.616
Why does she keep
apologizing so much?

03:44.650 --> 03:45.981
That's who she is.

03:46.020 --> 03:47.749
TAMARA:
Now, the prosecution contends

03:47.790 --> 03:50.384
that you buckled under
the pressure of your research.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.455
You were supposed
to deliver your results,

03:52.500 --> 03:54.320
and you missed
several deadlines.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.864
Missing deadlines is just,
um, I mean,

03:57.900 --> 03:59.367
everybody misses deadlines.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.594
_ TAMARA: _
DId you set the fIre

04:00.640 --> 04:02.699
that destroyed your lab,
Professor Whitton?

04:02.740 --> 04:04.537
No...

04:04.570 --> 04:06.970
Never. I, uh...

04:07.010 --> 04:08.807
Look, I was on the verge

04:08.840 --> 04:11.308
of a career-defining fellowship
at Cambridge.

04:11.350 --> 04:14.376
I would never do anything
to hurt my research.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.048
TAMARA: Where were you
at the time of the fire?

04:17.090 --> 04:20.878
Um, I was running on the, uh,
track across campus.

04:20.920 --> 04:21.989
WILL:
This is like watching

04:22.020 --> 04:24.853
a baby seal
being clubbed.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.427
That's after how many
sessions of witness prep?

04:27.460 --> 04:29.018
Three.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.664
You can't put her
on the stand.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.998
The stammering,
the nerves;

04:33.040 --> 04:33.995
she looks guilty.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.291
She's innocent.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.193
Yeah, well, so's
my four-year-old niece,

04:36.240 --> 04:37.662
but I wouldn't put her
on the stand either.

04:37.710 --> 04:38.665
What do you get
from her?

04:38.710 --> 04:40.701
Denial, alibi, context.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.002
You still have
the alibi witness?

04:42.040 --> 04:43.576
And the guard
and the arson expert.

04:43.610 --> 04:45.305
I'd keep her a mile away
from the stand.

04:45.350 --> 04:47.841
You put her on, she's
going away for 15 years.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.348
TAMARA:
That puts more pressure
on the other witnesses.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.846
Get some tougher
witness prep, will ya?

04:51.890 --> 04:53.653
Those were Wiffle Balls you
were throwing at her.

04:53.690 --> 04:55.089
Will, we're stretched
a little thin here.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.348
The layoffs?

04:58.860 --> 05:00.589
Uh, I'll put Josephson on it.
Josephson?

05:00.630 --> 05:02.598
No. I need it to be tougher.
More blood sport.

05:02.630 --> 05:03.995
You get two lavwers

05:04.030 --> 05:06.089
who really but heads, make them
prosecution-defense.

05:06.130 --> 05:07.563
You need this to be

05:07.600 --> 05:09.659
more Darwinian,
more real world.

05:12.910 --> 05:14.730
Doesn't get more
Darwinian than that.

05:14.780 --> 05:16.372
(chuckles)

05:16.410 --> 05:20.119
ALICIA: Witness prep 108.
Keith Thomas, arson expert.

05:20.150 --> 05:22.687
Mr. Thomas, can you
give us

05:22.720 --> 05:24.540
your professional opinion of
the arson investigations?

05:24.590 --> 05:25.989
It was a rush to judgment.

05:26.020 --> 05:27.612
The fire department
labeled it an arson,

05:27.660 --> 05:29.958
but the reality is,
it could've been an accident.

05:29.990 --> 05:32.595
But arson investigators
said they found traces

05:32.630 --> 05:34.359
of lighter fluid
at the crime scene.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.890
They're calling it
lighter fluid,

05:35.930 --> 05:37.921
but what they really
found was butane,

05:37.970 --> 05:40.359
which is not only
commonplace in a lab,

05:40.400 --> 05:41.833
but could_ _
spontaneously Ignite.

05:41.870 --> 05:43.838
Thank you, sir.

05:43.870 --> 05:46.577
Spontaneously ignite?

05:46.610 --> 05:47.804
Are you serious?

05:47.840 --> 05:50.877
THOMAS;
Yes, I am serious.
I try to be.

05:50.910 --> 05:54.539
Okay, well, then let's continue
in this serious vein.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.684
Aren't all the flammable liquids
stored in steel cabinets

05:56.720 --> 05:58.415
on the other side of the lab?

05:58.450 --> 06:00.589
Yes, I believe that's correct.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.383
You believe that's correct,
but you don't know.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.149
Wouldn't you object
at this point?

06:05.190 --> 06:06.396
No, she wouldn't.

06:06.430 --> 06:08.489
Just do your best, sir.

06:08.530 --> 06:12.398
We're just trying to prep you
for the tough questions.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.967
I misspoke. I should have
said, "Yes, that's correct."

06:16.000 --> 06:18.833
What about the wax residue found
at the crime scene?

06:18.870 --> 06:20.701
Investigators say it came
from a birthday candle

06:20.740 --> 06:22.640
used as part of a time-delay
incendiary device.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.772
You ever seen that before?

06:23.810 --> 06:26.813
A birthday candle can be used
as a three-minute fuse

06:26.850 --> 06:28.613
allowing the arsonist
to flee before a fire.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.083
But I think it's far more likely

06:30.120 --> 06:31.519
to have come
from some wax paper,

06:31.550 --> 06:33.757
which would not
be out of place at a lab.

06:33.790 --> 06:35.655
Yeah, I seen that
all the time in labs,

06:35.690 --> 06:37.453
for sandwiches
or comb harmonicas.

06:37.490 --> 06:38.650
THOMAS:
That's kinda rude.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.896
Oh, I'm just getting started.

06:39.930 --> 06:42.057
Did you ever visit
Dr. Whitton's lab, sir?

06:42.100 --> 06:44.728
No. I'm an expert witness;
I'm not an investigator.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.431
Did you evaluate photos
of the crime scene?

06:46.470 --> 06:48.131
Yes, I did.
But ultimately,

06:48.170 --> 06:50.161
your assessment of the fire is
based on pure conjecture.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.031
I'm offering my theory
based on years--

06:53.080 --> 06:54.274
Which you're being paid for.
As are you!

06:54.310 --> 06:56.847
Yeah, but only one of us is
trying to sell their theories

06:56.880 --> 06:57.847
as truth.
Okay.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.519
Let's just sum up, shall we?

07:00.550 --> 07:04.748
Your belief is that a
rag soaked in butane--

07:04.790 --> 07:07.179
a chemical which Dr. Whitton
never used in her work--

07:07.220 --> 07:11.725
somehow migrated across the lab
and into her research area,

07:11.760 --> 07:14.820
and then spontaneously
ignited on a piece

07:14.860 --> 07:17.693
of discarded wax paper.

07:19.270 --> 07:21.158
He was the best. Really.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.600
We had three other arson
experts, all half as good.

07:23.640 --> 07:28.202
Well... you know how I'm always
looking for a silver lining.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.174
It was a nice cross by your boy.

07:30.210 --> 07:31.177
Yes.

07:31.210 --> 07:32.973
Darwin is alive and well.

07:33.020 --> 07:36.114
The bad news is, we can't sell
this as an accident.

07:36.150 --> 07:39.483
Wax paper and
spontaneous combustion?

07:39.520 --> 07:41.010
Jurors will laugh you
out of court.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.620
So if we can't sell it
as an aCCIdent,

07:43.660 --> 07:46.128
sell it as arson,
just not by Ellen.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.559
You're doubting my story?

07:47.600 --> 07:49.249
No, we just feel
we have better options.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.860
But... But if I don't testify,

07:51.900 --> 07:54.232
won't the jury think
that I'm... suspicious?

07:54.270 --> 07:55.168
It's all about finding

07:55.200 --> 07:57.236
the best strategy
for acquittal, Ellen.

07:57.270 --> 08:00.671
They've taken my passport.

08:00.710 --> 08:02.177
Yes, well, that's...

08:03.950 --> 08:06.510
...standard.
Would you excuse me, please?

08:08.550 --> 08:10.780
I-I'm... Ijust...
you know...

08:10.820 --> 08:12.959
it feels like I'm
just being put

08:12.990 --> 08:14.878
in a smaller and smaller box.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.785
When does your family arrive?

08:16.830 --> 08:17.956
They're not coming.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.287
The last continuance,
they lost money

08:19.330 --> 08:20.695
on the plane tickets,
and I just

08:20.730 --> 08:24.268
told them not to come.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.564
I don't know
anyone here.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.862
I'll be right back.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.199
You can go, too, if you want.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.844
It's all right.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.815
It's not.

08:39.850 --> 08:42.148
I'm facing 15 years in prison.

08:44.590 --> 08:47.286
Left-wing bioconservatives,
religious bioconservatives,

08:47.320 --> 08:48.878
animal rights activists--

08:48.920 --> 08:50.956
Ellen's lab received
hate mail from all of them.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.287
Okay, good.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.399
Cary, you continue
with witness prep.

08:53.430 --> 08:56.024
Alicia, you help him.
Try to keep it competitive.

08:56.060 --> 08:57.527
Tamara, keep me
in the loop.

08:57.630 --> 08:58.289
What'd I miss?

08:58.330 --> 09:00.139
Plan B: Religious Fanatics.

09:00.170 --> 09:03.162
Saw your husband's appeal
starts today.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.199
Yep.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.559
Should be interesting.

09:05.610 --> 09:07.168
I'm kind of nostalgic

09:07.210 --> 09:09.007
for when things weren't
so interesting.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.007
You need a drink.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.904
Probably.

09:11.950 --> 09:13.941
PETER:
Hey, Mike.

09:13.980 --> 09:16.016
Judy, you look great.

09:16.050 --> 09:17.039
Oh... thank you.

09:17.090 --> 09:20.150
Hey, Bob, Alex.

09:20.190 --> 09:21.714
Peter.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.284
Nate.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.922
So, you've gained
a few pounds.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.849
(chuckles) I heard you, uh,
made some new friends in Tamms.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.822
Yeah, a nice burglar.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.189
I gave him your address.

09:31.230 --> 09:32.731
(laughs)

09:36.300 --> 09:37.631
You believe that?

09:37.670 --> 09:39.103
I hired Landry.

09:39.140 --> 09:41.700
Taught him
everything he knows.
Let's just hope you didn't

09:41.740 --> 09:43.742
teach him too well.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.240
BAILIFF:
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Harvey Winter.

09:53.020 --> 09:55.614
Mr. Florrick,
it's been a long time.

09:55.660 --> 09:57.958
Always a pleasure, Your Honor.

09:57.990 --> 10:00.754
GOLDEN: Uh, Your Honor, we would
first like to schedule

10:00.800 --> 10:02.620
an evidentiary hearing

10:02.670 --> 10:04.092
to present new
exculpatory evidence.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.768
Two weeks from today: 3:00.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.392
Thank you, Your Honor.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.238
I would also like you to
consider releasing my client

10:12.270 --> 10:14.773
on electronic monitoring
while the appeal is ongoing.

10:14.810 --> 10:17.074
Your Honor, bail should not even
be on the table at this point...

10:17.110 --> 10:18.873
Bail hearing is set for day
after tomorrow.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.014
5:00.
Your Honor,

10:21.050 --> 10:22.642
the state vehemently objects.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.282
Your vehemence is noted.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.049
There will be
a bail hearing here,

10:26.090 --> 10:28.183
day after tomorrow,
at 5:00, Mr. Landry.

10:28.220 --> 10:29.414
You're welcome to join us.

10:29.460 --> 10:33.851
If there's nothing else
to schedule, next case.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.968
How about that?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.888
Wow.
I could be out in two days.

10:38.930 --> 10:39.965
Mr. Florrick...

10:40.000 --> 10:41.069
See you.

10:42.470 --> 10:45.007
Soon.

10:53.080 --> 10:57.084
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

11:35.060 --> 11:36.209
So, is he getting out?

11:37.860 --> 11:39.725
How did you...?

11:39.760 --> 11:41.728
Who said that?
It was online.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.921
There's 65 articles.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.892
_ One even
in Singapore.

11:45.930 --> 11:48.160
You make it a habit
to check for Dad online?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.065
No, I have it on
Google Alert.

11:50.110 --> 11:53.773
Anytime there's an
article, I get an e-mail.

11:53.810 --> 11:55.937
So is he going
to live here?

11:55.980 --> 11:57.948
I don't know.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.777
How would you feel
about that, Grace?

11:59.820 --> 12:02.015
There's no space.

12:02.050 --> 12:03.449
Where's he gonna stay?

12:03.490 --> 12:06.243
In Mom's room.
Where do you think?

12:06.290 --> 12:07.484
He's gonna stay in your room?

12:07.520 --> 12:08.487
I don't know.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.488
Look, this just happened.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.679
It didn't even
just happen.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.028
It migh happen.
Shouldn't he get
an apartment?

12:14.060 --> 12:15.527
Dad's not going
to stay at an apartment.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.198
And besides, you should
be happy about this.

12:17.230 --> 12:19.892
It means Grandma won't have
to watch us.
Is that true?

12:19.940 --> 12:22.966
Yeah, he'll be on electronic
monitoring; he'll be stuck here.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.034
He would?

12:24.070 --> 12:25.469
I don't know.

12:25.510 --> 12:26.807
This is very premature.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.000
I promise you,

12:28.040 --> 12:30.349
we will sit down
and we'll discuss this.

12:30.380 --> 12:32.848
But for the moment,
I have to go to school

12:32.880 --> 12:34.108
and you have to go
to work...

12:34.150 --> 12:36.243
School, work.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.440
Okay?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.549
I love you.

12:39.590 --> 12:41.353
And I love you.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.321
No, first you reject
all press conferences.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.248
You just want to be
home with your family.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.255
That's all.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.995
No statements, no photos.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.122
Keep the press starved,

12:52.170 --> 12:54.161
then they'll eat
whatever you offer.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.293
MAN:
Peter.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.807
Private holding room.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.159
Sure beats lockup.

12:59.210 --> 13:01.474
(chuckles)

13:01.510 --> 13:05.503
Oh, yes, it's the upside of a
special priority defendant.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.074
The downside--
everything else.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.178
How are you?

13:08.220 --> 13:09.847
It's great to see
you, Peter.

13:09.890 --> 13:10.948
Uh, look...

13:13.090 --> 13:16.958
Landry is going to throw
everything he can at you

13:16.990 --> 13:18.480
trying to shut down bail.

13:18.530 --> 13:20.157
Now, I know Judge Winter.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.089
He's a decent guy.
He wants to do the right thing.

13:23.130 --> 13:25.166
A little nudge might help.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.167
(two soft pats)

13:28.200 --> 13:29.292
It's great to see you, Alex.

13:31.140 --> 13:34.530
Peter, we go back 20 years,
and you're looking for a wire.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.003
The one casualty of the
last eight months--

13:37.050 --> 13:38.904
trust.

13:38.950 --> 13:41.043
So what are you saying?

13:47.120 --> 13:48.849
I think we're fine.

13:48.890 --> 13:51.450
Appreciate your support.

13:51.490 --> 13:52.889
Good luck, Peter.

13:52.930 --> 13:54.249
Thanks.

14:03.340 --> 14:07.606
You know, I've never
lived on a farm,

14:07.640 --> 14:09.369
but I think that's
what it looks like

14:09.410 --> 14:11.173
when the weather vane
changes direction.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.610
A good change?

14:13.650 --> 14:16.881
If the assistant
state's attorney
is coming to me,

14:16.920 --> 14:19.388
a great change.

14:19.420 --> 14:22.116
It's just that I'm
in a time crunch.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.923
Does yours
involve anthrax?

14:23.960 --> 14:26.588
Hey, FBI big shot,
you owe me a favor.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.188
Look, just give
me 30 seconds.

14:28.230 --> 14:30.095
There's only half a dozen
pieces of hate mail.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.394
Cops didn't consider
them any serious threat.

14:32.430 --> 14:33.988
But I need a suspect.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.338
So if any of them seem
remotely legit, just...

14:37.340 --> 14:39.331
Tell them two minutes.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.675
Yeah, a couple women
from Wyoming.

14:42.710 --> 14:44.473
Crazy, but harmless.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.102
Defenders of Natural Life.

14:46.150 --> 14:47.412
It's a boilerplate
protest letter.

14:47.450 --> 14:50.010
They're not known for
taking any direct action.

14:50.050 --> 14:52.109
This one, the Christian
Coalition for Bioethics,

14:52.150 --> 14:53.287
they're legit.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.117
They're radical
religious bio-cons

14:55.160 --> 14:58.186
opposed to genetic engineering,
cloning, stem cell research.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.925
I've only known
them to be active

14:59.960 --> 15:01.518
on the West
Coast, but...
Define "active."

15:01.560 --> 15:03.425
Protests, vandalism...

15:03.470 --> 15:05.392
Not arson.

15:05.430 --> 15:08.467
But, hey, people change.

15:10.670 --> 15:12.661
They've also been known
to put coded messages

15:12.710 --> 15:14.678
in their letters.

15:14.710 --> 15:17.270
Someone behind this
has a real Zodiac complex.

15:17.310 --> 15:19.005
Good luck with that.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.415
Thank you for coming in
early, Ms. Bennett.

15:25.450 --> 15:26.348
We're really here just

15:26.390 --> 15:27.618
to make you comfortable
with your testimony,

15:27.660 --> 15:31.619
not to rehearse you or get you
to remember answers. In fact...

15:31.660 --> 15:34.151
If you're remembering answers,
we're doing our job poorly.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.122
It'll just feel
scripted in court.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.593
No, I get it.

15:37.630 --> 15:39.120
You want me natural.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.035
That's right.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.061
So, the first thing
we'll do is...

15:43.110 --> 15:45.066
...ask you some
very basic questions.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.566
What is your connection
to this case?

15:46.610 --> 15:49.408
Well, I work the front desk
at the biochem lab--

15:49.440 --> 15:50.668
the one that burned down.

15:50.710 --> 15:52.473
I work with Professor Whitton.

15:52.510 --> 15:54.068
I'm in the Physics Department.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.439
She's in Chemistry.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.608
Uh, but we really bonded
at a conference in St. Louis.

15:58.650 --> 16:00.356
Walt, answer
the questions simply.

16:00.390 --> 16:01.755
Nothing extraneous.

16:01.790 --> 16:04.384
The prosecution is going to
try to get you to ramble.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.454
Don't.

16:05.490 --> 16:07.549
I see Ellen every day.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.125
And, that day, she left
at 7:00 pm.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.990
7:00 pm. exactly?

16:12.030 --> 16:13.338
Yes. Why?

16:13.370 --> 16:14.394
I just find it odd.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.532
When was the last time

16:15.570 --> 16:18.130
anything ever happened
exactly at the hour?

16:18.170 --> 16:20.229
Um...

16:20.280 --> 16:21.736
Cary?

16:21.780 --> 16:24.078
Excuse me.

16:26.410 --> 16:28.446
What are you doing?

16:28.480 --> 16:30.243
I'm asking questions.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.713
You're cross-examining.
So, that's my job.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.355
No, our job
is to prep her,

16:35.390 --> 16:36.414
not undercut her.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.325
So, next time, warn her

16:38.360 --> 16:40.692
when you're flipping from
advisor to prosecutor.
Do we have a problem?

16:40.730 --> 16:42.254
We have a problem
if you're trying

16:42.300 --> 16:44.461
to show me up at the
expense of witness prep.

16:46.370 --> 16:47.735
Okay.

16:47.770 --> 16:49.135
You're right. I'm sorry.

16:50.570 --> 16:52.299
Ellen is a lovely person,

16:52.340 --> 16:53.272
and a great colleague.

16:53.310 --> 16:55.437
Uh, last fall,
when I wrote a cover article

16:55.480 --> 16:56.708
about electron crystallography

16:56.740 --> 16:58.674
for the Journal of Quantum
Physics, which is...

16:58.710 --> 17:00.678
Walt. ..
What? Yeah.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.745
Don't answer more
than the prosecution asks.

17:02.780 --> 17:04.281
Short, straightforward
answers.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.140
Gives a sense of confidence.

17:07.620 --> 17:11.181
Okay. I got it.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.458
Tell me about
the night of the fire.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.823
I saw her walk out of the lab
at 7:00 pm.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.418
And she didn't return?

17:17.470 --> 17:19.290
Uh-huh.
"Yes" or "no" answers, Mary.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.332
Ooh, right. Yes.

17:21.370 --> 17:25.204
I was at Dobson Auditorium
at 9:00 for a concert,

17:25.240 --> 17:28.073
uh, when I stepped outside
to phone my mother,

17:28.110 --> 17:30.442
and that's when I saw her, uh,
running around the track.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.640
From 50 yards away,
you saw her?

17:31.680 --> 17:33.341
I did, yeah.

17:33.380 --> 17:35.575
I-I recognized her track suit.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.508
It's not 50 yards.

17:37.550 --> 17:39.381
You know for a fact
it's not 50 yards?

17:39.420 --> 17:41.354
What'd you do?
Did you measure it?

17:41.390 --> 17:44.120
No, my students did.

17:45.530 --> 17:48.294
It was an experiment
in weights and measures.

17:48.330 --> 17:49.820
It's exactly 34 yards.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.420
A distance at which normal
Visual acwty

17:52.470 --> 17:56.292
can identify and distinguish
between human features.

17:56.340 --> 17:57.807
(knocking)

17:57.840 --> 17:59.831
Just_ reviewed
the Witness prep.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.406
Good job.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.647
Looks like both
witnesses will be great.

18:03.680 --> 18:04.806
Thanks.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.545
No, thank you.

18:06.580 --> 18:08.138
It's always the case,
isn't it?

18:08.180 --> 18:10.512
It's easier to rip apart
than to build up, so...

18:10.550 --> 18:13.257
thanks for building up.

18:13.290 --> 18:14.518
How's the appeal going?

18:14.560 --> 18:18.155
The... Oh, Peter's appeal.

18:18.190 --> 18:19.327
Good.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.622
Really good.

18:20.660 --> 18:22.196
Just...

18:22.230 --> 18:23.197
Peter will be out soon?

18:23.230 --> 18:25.664
Yeah.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.531
I don't know.

18:27.570 --> 18:29.629
Well, if you ever
need anything...

18:29.670 --> 18:31.661
If I ever need...

18:31.710 --> 18:33.905
Anything. Give me a call.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.431
Okay, I will.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.509
(sighs)

18:45.550 --> 18:48.189
WHI'I'I'ON:
Alicia.

18:48.220 --> 18:51.383
Diane told me to come
to you when anything...

18:51.430 --> 18:52.454
So I just wanted

18:52.490 --> 18:54.629
to get this to you
as soon as possible.

18:54.660 --> 18:57.663
It was on my windshield
when I got to my car.

19:00.870 --> 19:03.430
(elevator bell dings)

19:04.810 --> 19:07.199
Okay, you can drop
the cool thing.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.174
We're not at
school anymore.

19:09.210 --> 19:10.700
What cool thing?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.274
The... Look at you.

19:12.310 --> 19:13.675
The way you're standing.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.348
ZACH: I'm just standing.
What's your problem?

19:23.230 --> 19:25.653
Maybe it's from Mom's work.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.560
Wait.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.465
Maybe we should...

19:34.500 --> 19:35.660
What?

19:35.700 --> 19:37.861
I don't know.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.178
Great.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.552
(man speaking indistinctly)

20:06.630 --> 20:08.461
GRACE:
Is that Dad?

20:08.500 --> 20:09.899
I don't know.

20:09.940 --> 20:10.907
Is it...

20:10.940 --> 20:12.498
Is this fake, too?

20:12.540 --> 20:14.599
I don't know.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.699
This is
getting crazy.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.503
Zach, this
is serious.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.415
I know.

20:20.450 --> 20:23.283
But we agreed-- they're just
trying to scare Mom.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.242
Maybe there's a reason
she should be scared.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.609
We don't know enough.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.413
What do we need to know?

20:28.460 --> 20:30.280
Who sent this.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.423
Okay, so how?

20:35.630 --> 20:37.769
(indistinct conversation)

20:57.920 --> 21:00.354
ALICIA: Anything on
the CCB letters?

21:00.390 --> 21:01.618
Depends.

21:01.660 --> 21:05.448
Does "hidwcilfeteenuc"
mean anything to you?

21:05.490 --> 21:06.684
What's the context?

21:13.570 --> 21:14.764
How's witness prep?

21:14.800 --> 21:18.258
Not bad. We'll talk.

21:19.810 --> 21:22.301
I know we've talked about
you haVIng to testify,

21:22.340 --> 21:23.898
but it might happen sooner
than we anticipated.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.076
How soon?
Tomorrow.

21:25.110 --> 21:26.577
You want me to testify

21:26.610 --> 21:30.444
at his bail hearing?
We need to show the judge
that Peter will have a safe,

21:30.490 --> 21:32.742
stable living situation
if he's out on bail,

21:32.790 --> 21:34.758
and that he will
be welcomed home.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.551
You know what I'd like back?
Mm?

21:38.590 --> 21:40.592
Privacy.

21:43.830 --> 21:45.923
Landry's cross
could get personal.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.336
They think that Peter has
the judge in his pocket,

21:48.370 --> 21:49.598
so they're out
to draw blood.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.631
So keep your
answers short,

21:51.670 --> 21:53.331
to the point, unemotional.

21:53.380 --> 21:56.599
I spent six hours
prepping witnesses today.

21:56.640 --> 21:57.948
It's one thing
to know it.

21:57.980 --> 22:01.609
Um... lavwers always make
the worst witnesses.

22:01.650 --> 22:03.015
Thanks.

22:03.050 --> 22:05.939
I just want you
to be prepared.

22:05.990 --> 22:08.356
Who hired Kya? You or Peter?

22:09.660 --> 22:10.684
I did.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.699
Why did you hesitate?

22:13.730 --> 22:16.699
I didn't-- uh, Peter has
lots of friends who want

22:16.730 --> 22:18.721
to see his_
reputation burnished.

22:18.770 --> 22:20.658
In a way, they hired her.

22:20.700 --> 22:22.668
But she's good.
I mean, she supposedly did

22:22.700 --> 22:24.565
the same thing for the
Madoff sons this year.

22:24.610 --> 22:25.565
And that went so well.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.874
(chuckles)

22:27.910 --> 22:31.505
Do you want me to prep you?

22:31.550 --> 22:32.505
No. Thank you.

22:32.550 --> 22:33.778
Ithink I can handle it.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.515
If you don't mind me saying,

22:35.550 --> 22:38.678
there is some... ambivalence

22:38.720 --> 22:40.119
inherent in your
position, Alicia.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.653
And ambivalence could
hurt Peter's chances.

22:42.690 --> 22:44.829
I'm not going to lie
on the stand, Daniel.

22:44.860 --> 22:45.929
That's not what I'm saying.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.849
The truth is the truth,
but it can often sound...

22:48.900 --> 22:50.868
truer.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.737
Is the judge in Peter's pocket?

22:56.770 --> 22:57.805
No.

23:02.510 --> 23:03.670
I'll see you in court.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.801
*

23:53.230 --> 23:56.791
JUDGE:
Mr. Ford, your witness.

23:56.830 --> 23:58.058
You testified earlier

23:58.100 --> 24:00.694
that Dr. Whitton
left the lab at 7:00 p.m.?

24:00.740 --> 24:01.798
Uh-huh.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.230
I mean, yes.

24:05.270 --> 24:06.999
How long was your shift
that night?

24:07.040 --> 24:08.507
3:00 to 10:00.

24:08.540 --> 24:09.837
Seven hours.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.769
You must have taken
restroom breaks occa5ionally.

24:12.810 --> 24:14.971
You could have missed Dr.
Whitton reentering the building.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.682
I don't think I took
any breaks after 7:00.

24:17.720 --> 24:18.789
You don't think?

24:18.820 --> 24:20.651
Objection.
Badgering the witness.

24:20.690 --> 24:21.850
Overruled.

24:21.890 --> 24:23.824
Uh, you're under oath, Mary.

24:23.860 --> 24:25.851
Can you state with certainty

24:25.890 --> 24:29.929
that you never left your
post after 7:00 p.m.?

24:31.530 --> 24:32.758
N-No.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.665
Ijust...
You just...?

24:37.200 --> 24:38.269
I'm just not sure.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.005
(whispers):
Uh-oh.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.838
So Professor Whitton

24:42.880 --> 24:44.199
may have reentered
the building

24:44.250 --> 24:46.741
while you were away
from the security desk.

24:46.780 --> 24:48.941
In fact, she may
never have left.

24:48.980 --> 24:51.847
No. Um, I really think...

24:51.890 --> 24:54.552
A lot of middle-aged
brunettes work at the lab.

24:54.590 --> 24:55.989
You could have mistaken
someone else for her.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.159
I'm pretty sure...

24:58.190 --> 24:59.282
Pretty sure?

24:59.330 --> 25:00.797
Are you or are you not

25:00.830 --> 25:04.527
absolutely certain
you saw Dr. Whitton that night?

25:06.630 --> 25:07.858
Yes.

25:14.910 --> 25:16.969
We went through all
those questions in prep.

25:17.010 --> 25:18.147
More than once.

25:18.180 --> 25:19.772
Some witnesses
get intimidated by court.

25:19.810 --> 25:22.119
There's not much you can do
to prepare for that.

25:22.150 --> 25:24.914
Make sure Walt holds up.

25:24.950 --> 25:27.680
So, how damaging was that?

25:27.720 --> 25:28.789
It wasn't good.

25:28.820 --> 25:32.756
But we've still got the
threatening letters and Walt.

25:32.790 --> 25:35.850
Do you and Walt have
any history between you?

25:35.900 --> 25:36.855
Between. . .

25:36.900 --> 25:38.322
No... no, no.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.567
He just said that
you two really bonded

25:41.600 --> 25:42.931
at_a conference
in St. Louis.

25:42.970 --> 25:44.938
Well, we both attended it.

25:44.970 --> 25:47.939
We sat next to each other
at an awards banquet.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.538
Oh, the night
he won an award?

25:52.750 --> 25:54.012
(sighs)

25:54.050 --> 25:56.018
The cover article he wrote

25:57.750 --> 26:00.344
turns out to be three
paragraphs on page 46.

26:00.390 --> 26:01.209
We can't put someone who

26:01.260 --> 26:02.909
embellishes like that
on the stand.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.848
What we can't do is elicit
perjured testimony.

26:04.890 --> 26:06.619
So make sure
he doesn't perjure himself.

26:06.660 --> 26:08.719
But he's...
You're never handed
the perfect witness.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.250
You make the perfect witness.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.638
We're not sure we should
put you on the stand, Walt.

26:14.670 --> 26:16.888
What?

26:16.940 --> 26:18.908
Ithoughtshe
needed me.
She does.

26:18.940 --> 26:20.805
But we don't think you're
being straight with us.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.330
Yes, I am.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.974
No storytelling.
No embellishments.

26:25.010 --> 26:26.807
"Yes" means yes.
"No" means no.

26:26.850 --> 26:27.874
And if you get stuck--

26:27.920 --> 26:29.979
if the prosecution asks you
something you don't know

26:30.020 --> 26:31.840
or you don't understand--
don't ad lib an answer.

26:31.890 --> 26:32.982
You just say you don't know,

26:33.020 --> 26:34.783
or you wouldn't want
to speculate.

26:35.820 --> 26:36.752
Good.

26:36.790 --> 26:39.679
Where were you the night
of the arson, Walt?

26:39.730 --> 26:42.927
I was at the auditorium
for the piano reCItal.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.825
It started at 8:30 in
auditorium number four.

26:44.870 --> 26:46.724
That one has the best
acoustics, because of the...

26:46.770 --> 26:48.089
No. Walt.

26:49.670 --> 26:50.967
Eight-word sentences, max.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.262
You get to word nine,
just stop talking.

26:53.310 --> 26:56.131
How long were you
at the concert?

26:56.180 --> 26:59.172
Left around 9:00 to
make a phone call.

26:59.210 --> 27:02.145
To whom?

27:02.180 --> 27:04.045
My mother.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.308
And that's when I saw Ellen
across the street,

27:06.350 --> 27:07.749
at the track, running.

27:07.790 --> 27:10.953
And then the fire
trucks raced by.
You saw her
at the track at 9:00,

27:10.990 --> 27:12.924
but she may have just arrived.
How do you know she didn't

27:12.960 --> 27:14.791
light the fuse and run
straight to the track?

27:18.870 --> 27:20.963
I'm going to need more than
nine words to answer that.

27:25.140 --> 27:27.802
Okay, if she lit the fuse

27:27.840 --> 27:30.001
and the firefighters respond
within five minutes,

27:30.040 --> 27:33.043
that gives her a total of eight
minutes to run two miles.

27:33.080 --> 27:36.140
If she can do that, she might as
well sign up for the Olympics.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.911
My cousin Doug was
in the Olympics, actually.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.288
It was a joke.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.753
So, a letter written

27:44.790 --> 27:46.826
by the Christian Coalition
for Bioethics

27:46.860 --> 27:49.454
should have all the hallmarks
of a Protestant terrorist group:

27:49.500 --> 27:52.264
the logo, the cryptic
apropos Bible quote.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.996
Right? So why did
they pull a quote

27:55.040 --> 27:57.838
from the Douay-Rheims
edition, a Catholic Bible?

27:59.010 --> 28:01.331
St. Mary's, K through 12.

28:01.380 --> 28:04.770
See, Protestant versions,
like King James,

28:04.810 --> 28:07.938
call it the book of
Isaiah, no "5" at the end.

28:07.980 --> 28:11.746
_And verse 9:18
is some variation

28:11.790 --> 28:14.088
of "For wickedness
burneth like the fire."

28:14.120 --> 28:17.920
Did the first CCB letter
use the Catholic Bible, too?

28:17.960 --> 28:20.019
Both do.

28:20.060 --> 28:23.052
I think it's a red herring;
I think someone created it

28:23.100 --> 28:24.397
to throw the blame
on somebody else.

28:24.430 --> 28:27.092
I think you might
have someone in mind.

28:27.130 --> 28:29.098
Well, ifI were a cynic,
I'd say our client.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.267
She's the one who found the
letter on her windshield.

28:31.310 --> 28:32.834
You are a cynic.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.838
Yep.

29:04.070 --> 29:06.459
*

29:14.880 --> 29:16.017
What is that?

29:16.050 --> 29:17.347
Nothing.

29:17.380 --> 29:20.144
Oh, my God.

29:20.190 --> 29:22.283
How'd you...?

29:22.320 --> 29:25.084
You know what?
You're liking this.

29:25.130 --> 29:26.927
This is serious stuff, and
you're just having fun.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.996
Do I look like
I'm having fun?

29:29.030 --> 29:30.156
Yeah, you do.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.521
Look, somebody's trying
to set up Dad.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.993
Then go show it to him.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.439
What?

29:36.470 --> 29:39.200
Go show this stuff to Dad.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.504
He's at his bail hearing.
Go show him.

29:45.910 --> 29:48.014
Peter Florrick was
tried, convicted,

29:48.050 --> 29:49.312
sentenced.

29:49.350 --> 29:51.045
There's no longer any
presumption of innocence.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.011
This is not
about innocence.

29:52.050 --> 29:53.210
This is about bond.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.808
Peter Florrick

29:54.860 --> 29:56.350
has no previous record,
he is not a flight risk.

29:56.390 --> 29:58.858
He is a family man
who is eager to go home

29:58.890 --> 30:00.323
to his wife and children,
who are eager to have him.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.998
Oh, come on!
They are not eager.

30:02.030 --> 30:04.828
Is this true, Mr. Golden?

30:04.870 --> 30:07.122
It is, Your Honor.
They are... eager.

30:07.170 --> 30:09.058
Well...

30:09.100 --> 30:10.192
Let's find out.

30:11.610 --> 30:14.374
Please state your name
for the record.

30:14.410 --> 30:15.968
Alicia Florrick.

30:16.010 --> 30:18.342
Please state your relationship
to the defendant.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.112
I'm his wife.

30:29.020 --> 30:30.351
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

30:30.390 --> 30:33.587
And what is your current
living situation?

30:33.630 --> 30:36.053
I live with my-- with our--

30:36.100 --> 30:37.897
two children in a
three-bedroom apartment

30:37.930 --> 30:39.898
at 3001 N. Dearborn Street.

30:39.930 --> 30:41.363
And is there room
for Mr. Florrick there?

30:41.400 --> 30:43.288
Yes.

30:44.670 --> 30:47.332
And should he be granted
a pretrial release,

30:47.370 --> 30:49.634
are you prepared
to have him at home?

30:49.680 --> 30:51.978
Um... do you want him there?

30:53.380 --> 30:56.645
I think Peter should be home
with his children.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.341
Thank you.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.551
LANDRY: Mrs. Florrick, you
mentioned the apartment

31:06.590 --> 31:10.253
is a three bedroom,
and you have two children.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.393
Would they share a room?

31:14.170 --> 31:15.398
No.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.329
So, you and your
husband would...

31:18.370 --> 31:20.201
share a room?

31:21.540 --> 31:22.939
Yes.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.572
You're saying under oath

31:24.610 --> 31:26.498
that you intend
to share a bed with...

31:26.550 --> 31:28.313
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

31:28.350 --> 31:29.476
I'm-I'm simply establishing
that there truly

31:29.520 --> 31:31.545
is a place for Mr. Florrick,
given everything that's...

31:31.590 --> 31:33.581
This is a private
family matter,

31:33.620 --> 31:35.087
Your Honor.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.257
That's enough, Counselor.

31:36.290 --> 31:37.985
Whether they intend
to share a bed

31:38.030 --> 31:39.349
is of no concern
to this court.

31:39.390 --> 31:41.392
Thank you, Your Honor.

31:42.600 --> 31:46.127
Mrs. Florrick, I have
one more question.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.535
Did you meet with a divorce
attorney on February 23?

31:57.340 --> 31:58.443
Yes.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.540
I had a brief consultation

32:01.580 --> 32:03.218
with a divorce attorney

32:03.250 --> 32:06.549
a few days after the allegations
against my husband surfaced,

32:06.590 --> 32:09.479
in order to weigh my options.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.353
Are you saying you've ruled out
the possibility of divorce?

32:12.390 --> 32:14.153
I-I have no plans to divorce.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.394
But you haven't ruled it out?

32:15.430 --> 32:17.318
I haven't ruled_out
running for pre5ident.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.590
Probably won't happen, but
I haven't ruled it out.

32:19.630 --> 32:22.497
So, you intend

32:22.540 --> 32:24.667
to welcome Mr. Florrick
back into your home?

32:24.710 --> 32:26.462
Yes.

32:26.510 --> 32:27.704
Despite the sexual dalliances
with call girls...

32:27.740 --> 32:30.402
My son is here, Mr. Landry.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.272
Are you suggesting you'd give
different answers if he weren't?

32:36.320 --> 32:37.241
I'm suggesting you stop

32:37.280 --> 32:40.340
asking invasive and
irrelevant questions.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.116
Isn't it true...

32:43.160 --> 32:44.354
What's your goal
here, Mr. Landry?

32:44.390 --> 32:45.584
Mrs. Florrick...

32:45.630 --> 32:46.983
To do your
boss's bidding?

32:47.030 --> 32:48.395
To embarrass me?

32:48.430 --> 32:50.091
Embarrass my husband?

32:50.130 --> 32:52.098
To goad me into
some emotional

32:52.130 --> 32:54.234
public renunciation of him?

32:54.270 --> 32:55.737
The relevant
question here

32:55.770 --> 32:59.069
_ is whether Peter has a
swtable place to go home to.

32:59.110 --> 33:01.374
And I am stating,
under oath,

33:01.410 --> 33:03.071
that he does.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.371
Any further questions?

33:07.380 --> 33:10.144
Why don't we leave it there?

33:10.180 --> 33:12.740
I'll take the arguments
and testimony into consideration

33:12.790 --> 33:14.109
and rule tomorrow.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.458
I can't believe you.

33:16.490 --> 33:18.355
It's really not
that big of a deal.

33:18.390 --> 33:20.381
How did you even
get out here?

33:20.430 --> 33:22.455
I took the El.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.627
I wanted to see Dad.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.490
Why wasn't he there?

33:26.530 --> 33:28.191
Because this was
just for the lavwers.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.663
And don't try
and change the subject.

33:30.700 --> 33:32.258
You a me.

33:32.310 --> 33:33.800
You talk to me.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.501
I would have
brought you.

33:35.540 --> 33:36.632
You wouldn't have.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.671
I...

33:40.150 --> 33:42.368
I would have.

33:42.420 --> 33:43.648
So trust me.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.656
I thought you kicked ass.

33:48.690 --> 33:50.681
(both chuckling)

33:52.630 --> 33:54.097
You're still in trouble.

33:54.130 --> 33:55.552
I know.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.727
I have to get you home,

33:57.760 --> 33:59.421
and then I have
to check an alibi.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.290
What is that?

34:01.340 --> 34:02.796
This? Nothing.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.161
Homework.

34:06.740 --> 34:11.200
I ran an ink X-ray analysis
on the fake CCB letters.

34:11.250 --> 34:14.469
The toner is
Office Store brand 4546-H.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.511
Very unique.

34:16.550 --> 34:18.415
And one of the few places
that uses it

34:18.450 --> 34:20.418
is the printer
at Ellen's office.

34:20.450 --> 34:22.452
Okay, well,
that's disappointing.

34:22.490 --> 34:24.355
Yep, disappointing

34:24.390 --> 34:26.187
because it looks like she's
sending threats to herself.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.458
Where are you?

34:27.490 --> 34:29.299
Polytech.
The auditorium.

34:29.330 --> 34:31.423
Cary and I are going
to check out her alibi.

34:31.470 --> 34:32.425
(static)
What?

34:32.470 --> 34:34.097
I'm losing you. Call me back.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.430
Hey.

34:36.470 --> 34:39.359
So, Walt came out
of auditorium four

34:39.410 --> 34:40.160
and he stood here.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.474
Right. He came
out at 9:00 p.m.,

34:42.510 --> 34:43.499
looked across the street.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.748
34 yards towards the track
where Ellen was running.

34:46.780 --> 34:49.510
Well, with this lighting,
that should be all right.

34:49.550 --> 34:51.279
Do you have a
navigation system?

34:51.320 --> 34:52.582
Yeah.

34:52.620 --> 34:55.657
(remote chirps, engine starts)

34:55.690 --> 34:58.227
Ah, finally.

34:58.260 --> 34:59.454
Bars. I wasn't
getting any before.

34:59.490 --> 35:00.718
Yeah. Me, neither.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.251
Recital hall
must be a dead zone.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.120
Auditorium at school
has a scrambler

35:05.170 --> 35:06.899
to stop cell phones from ringing
during a performance.

35:06.930 --> 35:10.593
I bet they got
the same thing here.

35:10.640 --> 35:13.507
How could Walt phone his mom
from the auditorium door,

35:13.540 --> 35:14.700
if it's a dead zone?

35:16.580 --> 35:17.399
And look-- check this out.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.772
Walt said the fire
trucks came here,

35:19.810 --> 35:23.519
on University Av,
but the fire station

35:23.550 --> 35:25.882
is there and the
lab is there.
Yeah.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.581
But Garden Av is a direct route.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.554
Why would the firefighters
go the long way around?

35:29.590 --> 35:30.579
They wouldn't.

35:32.730 --> 35:34.288
(phone line rings)

35:34.330 --> 35:35.592
KALINDA (on phone):
Yeah?

35:35.630 --> 35:38.667
What toner
does Walt's office use?

35:38.700 --> 35:39.826
The Physics Department?!

35:39.870 --> 35:43.499
The same. The whole Science
Department orders in bulk.

35:43.540 --> 35:45.508
Oh, my God.
What?

35:45.540 --> 35:46.609
Walt said it.

35:46.640 --> 35:49.575
Only an Olympian could run
two miles in eight minutes.

35:49.610 --> 35:51.544
So how does he get
eight minutes?

35:51.580 --> 35:53.571
Three minutes
for the fuse to burn down,

35:53.610 --> 35:56.317
and five minutes for
the firefighters to arrive.

35:56.350 --> 35:58.580
But how does Walt know
the fuse is three minutes?

35:58.620 --> 36:00.349
The arson expert
mentioned it in prep,

36:00.390 --> 36:02.483
but how does Walt know?

36:02.520 --> 36:04.226
'Cause he did it.

36:12.700 --> 36:14.395
If we go to the
state's attorney's office...

36:14.440 --> 36:16.192
There's not enough to clear
Ellen and prosecute Walt.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.435
We don't have definitive proof
he sent the CCB letters.

36:18.470 --> 36:19.903
They'd simply thank us
and bury it.

36:19.940 --> 36:23.398
You know one option,
if you want to really be gutsy?

36:23.440 --> 36:26.409
Nail him on the stand.
Trap him in his own lies.

36:26.450 --> 36:27.747
DIANE:
And if we do it wrong,

36:27.780 --> 36:29.668
we just proved our alibi false.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.688
Hey, no pain, no gain.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.244
Did you really just say that?

36:33.290 --> 36:35.383
Yes, I did.
Meant it, too.

36:35.420 --> 36:36.853
Well...

36:36.890 --> 36:40.326
we're either about to destroy
the prosecution's case

36:40.360 --> 36:41.793
or make it.

36:41.830 --> 36:44.526
Uh, I arrived just as the
performance began at 8:30.

36:44.570 --> 36:47.824
Around 9:00, I stepped outside
to phone my mother...

36:47.870 --> 36:50.634
uh, right in front
of the recital hall.

36:50.670 --> 36:51.637
Did she answer?

36:51.670 --> 36:53.308
Uh, no, I...
I got her voicemail.

36:53.340 --> 36:56.275
But the recital_hall
scrambles the Signals

36:56.310 --> 36:57.732
so calls don't interfere
With the performance,

36:57.780 --> 36:59.441
so how could you
have gotten through?

37:01.680 --> 37:03.545
I wouldn't want to speculate.

37:03.580 --> 37:06.617
There's no record of that call
in your cell phone records.

37:06.650 --> 37:09.585
No record of any call at all...

37:09.620 --> 37:11.588
What is this?
What is she doing?

37:11.630 --> 37:13.848
_ Just wait.
Did you see anyone
while you were in front

37:13.890 --> 37:15.323
of the recital hall?

37:15.360 --> 37:18.329
Uh, yes.
Uh, I saw Ellen Whitton,

37:18.370 --> 37:20.668
uh, running the track
across the street.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.668
And then the fire trucks
raced by to the lab.

37:22.700 --> 37:23.667
On University Avenue?

37:23.700 --> 37:24.837
Uh, yes,
that's correct.

37:24.870 --> 37:25.859
But University Avenue

37:25.910 --> 37:28.629
isn't the most direct route

37:28.680 --> 37:30.636
from the fire station
to the lab.

37:32.310 --> 37:35.347
Uh, well...

37:35.380 --> 37:36.779
I'm sure _
that emergency vehicles

37:36.820 --> 37:39.516
can go any way they want,
can't they?

37:39.550 --> 37:41.780
I'm not sure why they'd opt
to go the longer way

37:41.820 --> 37:43.481
when they could just
take Garden Avenue.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.851
Well, I guess
you'd have to ask them.

37:44.890 --> 37:46.721
I did.

37:48.330 --> 37:51.458
They said they did
take Garden Avenue.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.422
Where were you when
the fire occurred, Walt?

37:54.670 --> 37:57.935
Uh, I was at the, uh, the
piano recital, like I said.

37:57.970 --> 37:59.528
Hmm. Strange.

37:59.570 --> 38:00.468
We can't find
a Single person

38:00.510 --> 38:02.831
who remembers seeing you
at the recital hall.

38:04.610 --> 38:06.578
Even during intermission.

38:06.610 --> 38:08.874
I, uh, I went right to the
restroom at intermission.

38:08.920 --> 38:12.708
I, uh, wasn't feeling well.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.809
_ There was no_
intermi55ion that night.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.657
The performance was

38:19.790 --> 38:21.519
You weren't at the
recital, Walt.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.051
You were at the lab, waiting...

38:24.100 --> 38:26.898
to set the fire, destroy
Ellen's research,

38:26.930 --> 38:28.397
and frame her for it.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.396
No.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.067
No. What...?

38:32.110 --> 38:34.431
Why...?

38:34.480 --> 38:37.779
IfI wanted to-to-to frame her,

38:37.810 --> 38:39.778
why would I be here,
vouching for her?

38:39.810 --> 38:42.973
I don't know. Is it because you
set the fire to keep her here

38:43.020 --> 38:45.079
instead of off
at the Cambridge fellowship?

38:48.860 --> 38:52.079
But you never meant to have
it pinned on her, did you?

38:52.130 --> 38:53.529
And when it was,

38:53.560 --> 38:54.720
you tried to save her.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.057
With an alibi.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.091
With fake letters
from a hate group.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.661
I...

39:03.640 --> 39:05.801
Mr. Gifford?

39:13.850 --> 39:16.045
Mr. Gifford, let
me quickly say,

39:16.080 --> 39:17.877
you have a Fifth
Amendment right

39:17.920 --> 39:19.911
against self-incrimination.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.768
*

40:01.960 --> 40:04.895
Aw, crap.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.525
(camera shutter clicking)

40:37.000 --> 40:38.558
BAILIFF:
All rise

40:38.600 --> 40:41.660
for the Honorable
Judge Harvey Winter.

40:46.970 --> 40:48.528
Before I rule on bail,

40:48.580 --> 40:49.933
I'm told
the prosecution intends

40:49.980 --> 40:51.777
to make a proffer to the court.

40:51.810 --> 40:53.641
LANDRY: That's correct,
Your Honor.

40:53.680 --> 40:57.138
The state has recently received
evidence that the defendant

40:57.180 --> 40:59.887
has attempted to interfere
with the judicial process.

40:59.920 --> 41:01.046
What?!
I have a signed affidavit

41:01.090 --> 41:03.058
from ASA Alex Phelan

41:03.090 --> 41:04.626
stating that
Peter Florrick

41:04.660 --> 41:07.982
has asked him to influence
Your Honor into granting bail.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.897
Now _we know Your Honor
is truly impartial,

41:10.930 --> 41:13.160
and that any influence would
have landed on deaf ears,

41:13.200 --> 41:16.931
but we also believe
that Mr. Florrick has put you

41:16.970 --> 41:19.768
in an awkward position,

41:19.810 --> 41:22.028
confusing the public
as to the impartiality

41:22.080 --> 41:23.968
of any bail offer
you might extend.

41:24.010 --> 41:26.706
Your Honor,
this is outrageous!

41:26.750 --> 41:28.001
It is that, Mr. Golden.

41:28.050 --> 41:29.745
It is pure fiction.

41:42.130 --> 41:44.894
Mr. Phelan is an officer
of the court, Counselor.

41:44.930 --> 41:46.921
Unless you have
concrete evidence

41:46.970 --> 41:48.938
that Mr. Phelan is lying,

41:48.970 --> 41:50.528
the proffered information

41:50.570 --> 41:52.003
is considered reliable

41:52.040 --> 41:53.803
and relevant.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.638
(whispering)

42:03.580 --> 42:04.979
Bail is hereby denied.

42:05.020 --> 42:06.681
This court is adjourned.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.622
Peter, I'm so sorry.

42:14.660 --> 42:16.799
Alex Phelan was at
Zach's baptism, remember?

42:16.830 --> 42:18.149
Could he have misinterpreted?

42:18.200 --> 42:19.667
No.

42:21.270 --> 42:24.262
It's a betrayal.

42:24.300 --> 42:25.562
I thought I'd be
leaving with you.

42:25.610 --> 42:26.861
Mr. Florrick.

42:26.910 --> 42:27.899
You'll tell the kids?

42:27.940 --> 42:28.907
I will.

42:28.940 --> 42:31.909
I'll see you.

42:33.780 --> 42:35.714
(whispers):
This was a set-up.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.802
Peter didn't make bail.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.041
So, who is it?

43:09.080 --> 43:10.968
I don't know.

43:11.020 --> 43:12.783
But...

43:12.820 --> 43:15.812
What's he doing?

43:15.860 --> 43:18.283
He's taking pictures
of our front door.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.322
Why?

43:24.060 --> 43:25.698
I don't know.
