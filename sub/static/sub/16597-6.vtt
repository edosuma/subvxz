08:36.617 --> 08:38.586
Our main points being
shorter shifts

and a more reasonable
nurse-to-patient ratio.

I think the shifts
are the right length,

back me up.

Which studies are those?

No. I...
Are you questioning
my integrity?

No. I was just wondering...
I think you're questioning
my integrity.

Seems like
you're questioning
my integrity!

ask some people who are

for this.

stop and focus on

hearing that?

shut up about it.

don't agree with that.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.211
That's just an accent.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.545

10:45.578 --> 10:47.347
Oh, I'm not mocking
Koreans.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.483
I'm mocking my dad,
who happens to be Korean.

did you study the material

that the school
e-mailed you?

10:56.990 --> 11:00.460

you think just because
I'm Korean,

11:00.493 --> 11:01.929

the stereotype... No?

you neither speak

I'm a little lugubrious.

more important to me

16:51.478 --> 16:55.148
than getting us what we need
to care for our patients.

This isn't just about
higher salaries
or longer breaks.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.419
We're not doing this
for ourselves.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.922

like, like Audra Middleton,

17:02.955 --> 17:04.391

17:04.424 --> 17:06.893
And when she comes in here
for her insulin management,

17:06.926 --> 17:08.928
she deserves better
than an exhausted nurse

17:08.961 --> 17:12.031
that just saw 30 patients
in the time
they should've seen 12!

at the wheel

17:17.337 --> 17:20.207
after working a double shift
in our understaffed E.R.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.374
And then the irony is,

17:21.408 --> 17:23.576
she came back to that E.R.
in an ambulance,

17:23.610 --> 17:26.179
only to be tended to
by other exhausted nurses.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.737

21:12.238 --> 21:13.906
Oh, yeah, she did!

21:15.575 --> 21:17.209
Classic Young-Mi.
