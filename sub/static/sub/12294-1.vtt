04:28.595 --> 04:31.012
Don't let him touch you!

06:33.368 --> 06:35.186
Butt Pie.

06:36.659 --> 06:40.427
There's a sequel to a book written
called Butt Cake.

06:40.588 --> 06:45.184
Very popular at the news-stands.
About a butt with cake all over it.

06:50.138 --> 06:52.240
Chunky Asses?

07:53.898 --> 07:57.341
<i>Welcome to the Mel Backman Journal.
I'm Mel Backman.</i>

07:57.510 --> 08:00.858
<i>And here with me today is Chandler Jarrell</i>

08:00.859 --> 08:03.500
<i>who's doing something
very vital to the community.</i>

08:03.501 --> 08:04.800
<i>or for the community, I should say</i>

08:04.903 --> 08:08.634
<i>Because Chandler is a finder of lost children.
Am I correct?</i>

08:09.306 --> 08:13.200
<i>- Yes, I find missing children.
- That's very interesting.</i>

08:13.437 --> 08:16.030
<i>You know, there was a show a couple of
years back called Finder of Lost Loves. </i>

08:16.031 --> 08:16.753
<i>Did you ever see that?</i>

08:18.353 --> 08:20.507
<i>- Tony Franciosa, I believe,
was the star of that.</i>

08:20.708 --> 08:23.229
<i>- Ah, listen, I'm looking for this girl...
- I hope you're not nervous.</i>

08:23.230 --> 08:28.244
<i>Which is perfectly normal. This is
my fifth show and I'm still nervous.</i>

08:28.254 --> 08:33.285
<i>In fact, is there anyone here
who's not nervous? Are you nervous?</i>

08:33.563 --> 08:37.049
<i>Listen, I'm trying to find this girl.
Her name is Cheryl Mosely,</i>

08:37.100 --> 08:41.669
<i>This is wonderful. Because this is
exactly what the Mel Backman</i>

08:42.070 --> 08:46.996
<i>When I first came to RST cable, I told them
I didn't want to be another Merv, another Johnny.</i>

08:47.805 --> 08:51.678
<i>I want to do the kind of vital programming
that's responsive to the community.</i>

08:53.668 --> 08:57.063
<i>Listen, I'm trying to find this girl,
her name is Cheryl Mosely.</i>

08:57.065 --> 08:58.691
<i>This is wonderful.</i>

08:59.019 --> 09:03.114
<i>Lets say I'm a young person and
I want to get into your line of work,</i>

09:03.115 --> 09:05.872
<i>is there a course I can take
at a community college? Or...</i>

09:06.972 --> 09:10.169
<i>- All you have to do is care about children.
- Do you recommend this line of work?</i>

09:10.751 --> 09:11.812
<i>Can you make a lot of money doing this?</i>

09:13.751 --> 09:15.600
<i>Her name is Cheryl Mosely.
She's sixt...</i>

09:15.601 --> 09:19.269
<i>This is a little off the subject,
but that's a wonderfuly uniquel hat.</i>

09:19.322 --> 09:20.306
<i>Can I ask where did you got that?</i>

09:21.500 --> 09:26.071
<i>- She's 16 and I'm trying to find her...
- Great, let's say you do find her.</i>

09:26.138 --> 09:29.663
<i>What would you say to her?
What would be the first thing</i>

09:32.561 --> 09:36.435
<i>- She's 16 years old, her name is Cheryl Mosely...
- Thank you so much, Chandler.</i>

09:36.500 --> 09:39.108
<i>Now, let's talk about tortoises.
Judy, what have you got here?</i>

09:39.920 --> 09:42.408
<i>- Oh, this is Teddy who is 80 years old.
- Really? 80?</i>

09:42.475 --> 09:45.056
<i>- Isn't he darling?
- He's wonderful.</i>

09:45.100 --> 09:48.063
<i>Now listen, I'm trying to find this girl,
Cheryl Mosely.</i>

09:48.200 --> 09:52.135
<i>She was last seen on Vineland
out in North Hollywood.</i>

09:52.144 --> 09:55.947
<i>I'd appreciate it if you contact me
at 468-8492 if you have any...</i>

09:56.000 --> 10:00.643
<i>- Thank you
- Shut up. If you have any information</i>

10:01.000 --> 10:04.450
<i>Yo! Hey! If you don't put the camera back,
I'll bust your ass.</i>

10:04.713 --> 10:08.736
<i>Cheryl Mosely, Chandler Jarrell,
24 hours a day, 468-8492.</i>

10:08.740 --> 10:12.465
<i>Now you can talk whatever you
wanted to talk about with the tortoises.</i>

10:12.500 --> 10:14.597
<i>Thank you. That was Chandler Jarrell.</i>

10:15.045 --> 10:17.572
<i>Well, I understand that
you've had a sex change?</i>

10:29.923 --> 10:32.859
OK, let's go. Take it slow, now.
Tie him, tie him.

10:32.870 --> 10:35.896
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Why are you hanging

10:36.068 --> 10:40.157
Alright! Let's go. There you go.
All the way, boys. 

10:40.802 --> 10:42.396
Yes!

10:43.266 --> 10:45.504
All right, come on, now.

10:46.596 --> 10:49.792
Yo, man. What's wrong with you?
Scrub. You're a major scrub.

10:50.754 --> 10:52.381
Scrub.

10:57.730 --> 10:59.998
- Good afternoon, Mr Jarrell.
- Hi.

11:00.162 --> 11:03.906
- So you're the finder of lost children.
- Oh, you must have seen me on television.

11:04.067 --> 11:08.639
- Yeah, I like working with children.
- Hey, Chandler, come on!

11:08.802 --> 11:10.493
Shut up!

11:12.899 --> 11:14.970
- A child has been kidnapped.
- When?

11:15.139 --> 11:17.856
Five days ago in north-eastern Tibet.

11:18.017 --> 11:20.287
Tibet's a little bit
out of my territory.

11:20.449 --> 11:22.839
This child is special, Mr Jarell

11:23.010 --> 11:26.392
- His destiny is to save the world.
- That's a good destiny.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.081
Chandler, throw the ball!

11:29.249 --> 11:30.679
Here!

11:30.849 --> 11:34.744
400 years ago, the Neuchung Oracle
predicted that the <i>Gompen Tarma</i>,

11:34.913 --> 11:36.985
that is Tibetan for "Golden Child",

11:37.152 --> 11:40.186
would be taken to the new city,
the City of the Angels.

11:40.352 --> 11:42.721
He would be rescued by
a man who is no angel.

11:42.881 --> 11:44.824
- Who is that?
- You, Mr Jarell

11:46.337 --> 11:48.824
Yeah, right. OK.

11:48.993 --> 11:53.019
I'm in the middle of a basketball game,
although I'd love to stay and chat with you.

11:54.304 --> 11:58.133
- This looks like a big joint.
- I'm serious, Mr Jarrell.

11:58.304 --> 12:00.672
Lick it and smoke it.

12:01.408 --> 12:05.151
I think there were two of these,
and you smoked the other one.

12:05.952 --> 12:08.408
Put it in your bag
and stop smoking scrolls.

12:08.576 --> 12:09.415
You know, it looks like a joint.

12:09.416 --> 12:13.444
And you might get jumped by some
Rastafarians if you walk around with it, 

12:13.600 --> 12:16.185
Excuse me, I have a game to play.
It was a nice thought.

12:16.351 --> 12:18.872
I realise it's hard for you to take in,

12:19.039 --> 12:21.047
but it's your destiny
to find the Golden Child.

12:21.216 --> 12:24.150
And it's your destiny to seek
 some serious psychiatric help.

12:24.319 --> 12:27.701
Really. Excuse me. Can I go and play now?
Please, go home?

12:27.871 --> 12:31.132
Excuse me.
And such a cute girl, too.

12:31.295 --> 12:33.051
Dope fiend!

12:38.014 --> 12:41.592
- Is that her?
- Yes, that's Cheryl Mosely.

12:41.759 --> 12:45.556
- How long has she been missing?
- About three weeks.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.792
- What have you got?
- Not much.

12:48.959 --> 12:54.326
Three days ago, the rental sign goes
down and a truck backs up to the door.

12:54.495 --> 12:57.429
The neighbours hear a continuous,
low murmur night and day.

12:57.598 --> 13:01.559
At ten last night, the truck pulls up again
and the murmuring stops.

13:01.726 --> 13:05.982
A neighbour comes out to shut up
his dog who won't come down the hill.

13:06.143 --> 13:09.077
He looks over the fence
and finds the body.

13:16.734 --> 13:21.490
- Who rented the place?
- She did. By phone, mailed in cash.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.491
- Did you take the referral I sent you?
- No.

13:26.653 --> 13:31.062
- You only take the kid cases.
- Yeah.

13:31.228 --> 13:34.077
<i>Get a few more shots in here.</i>

15:07.610 --> 15:12.212
Ms Tibet, you can come out now.
Stop following me, I won't take your case.

15:12.377 --> 15:14.798
You're already on it.

15:14.969 --> 15:18.548
What makes you think
the kid was in the house?

15:19.962 --> 15:23.954
This is a restraint curse. They must
restrain him spiritually and physically.

15:24.121 --> 15:27.766
They need to keep evil on him
on all four sides of him at all times.

15:27.930 --> 15:31.605
Just the writing isn't enough.
They'd need something else.

15:31.769 --> 15:34.735
- Or what?
- Or the child projects himself astrally.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.477
Give me a break.

15:47.225 --> 15:49.679
You're telling me
that the people that killed Cheryl...

15:49.848 --> 15:54.517
If I find them, they're the same people
that kidnapped the...

15:54.681 --> 15:56.567
...the Golden Child. Exactly.

15:56.728 --> 15:58.157
Right.

15:58.328 --> 16:00.749
- But why would they kill Cheryl?
- I don't know.

16:00.919 --> 16:04.497
- Why are they feeding the kid blood?
- Are you sure?

16:04.663 --> 16:08.046
- I found a bowl of oatmeal...
- Yes?

16:08.217 --> 16:11.860
...with some blood on the bottom of it.
It's probably hers.

16:13.750 --> 16:17.264
I don't know. There is somebody
we could ask about the blood.

16:17.432 --> 16:20.334
This is LA, though. You're going to
ask somebody about the blood?

16:20.503 --> 16:24.016
Are they in this world
or do we have to project there?

16:24.791 --> 16:26.197
Some part of the galaxy...

16:38.552 --> 16:41.683
Mr Jarrell, you honour my shop
with your presence.

16:47.831 --> 16:50.864
He's very pleased
to meet a man as great as you.

16:51.031 --> 16:52.918
How do you say "Thank you"?

17:02.805 --> 17:05.107
We must speak to Kala.

17:05.973 --> 17:08.275
OK... Hey!

17:28.019 --> 17:29.809
Mr Jarrell.

17:39.637 --> 17:42.418
You may speak with her.
She can hear you.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.460
Tell me about the Golden Child.

17:48.627 --> 17:52.785
Every thousand generations,
a perfect child is born.

17:53.813 --> 17:56.331
A Golden Child.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.702
He has come to rescue us.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.948
- Rescue us from what?
- From ourselves.

18:05.268 --> 18:07.723
He is the Bringer of Compassion.

18:07.890 --> 18:11.535
If he dies, compassion will die with him.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.383
If something happens to the kid,
the whole world goes to hell?

18:14.548 --> 18:17.678
The world will become hell!

18:18.643 --> 18:22.418
It's not far from that now!
Who would want to take the kid?

18:22.579 --> 18:26.060
Those who want evil rather than good.

18:29.875 --> 18:33.672
- Can you be more specific?
- We do not know who took him.

18:33.843 --> 18:37.355
Could you tell me why
they are trying to make him eat blood?

18:37.522 --> 18:40.305
Nothing in this world will hurt him.

18:40.467 --> 18:45.255
But if he were to pollute himself
with anything impure,

18:45.426 --> 18:47.880
he would become vulnerable.

18:48.049 --> 18:51.498
OK. So if <i>they...</i>

18:51.667 --> 18:54.699
If he eats the blood, they can kill him.

18:54.866 --> 18:56.905
Yes.

18:58.033 --> 19:00.554
Do you have any other questions?

19:02.034 --> 19:04.717
As a matter of fact I do.

19:04.881 --> 19:08.971
What are you doing this weekend,
because your silhouette is kicking!

19:13.777 --> 19:16.493
She plays the maraccas, too?

19:17.777 --> 19:21.902
- This is the Chosen One?
- Yes...

19:22.064 --> 19:25.327
You people put on a good show.
Where did you find her?

19:25.488 --> 19:28.423
She's the librarian
at the Secret Repository at Palkor Sin.

19:28.592 --> 19:32.717
She was flown here to help us.
She's over 300 years old.

19:32.880 --> 19:37.452
- How did she manage that one?
- One of her ancestor was raped by a dragon.

19:40.144 --> 19:42.926
Does that happen a lot
where you're from?

19:55.151 --> 19:57.639
I'm sorry I got a little harsh.
Why don't you come up for a while?

19:57.808 --> 19:59.052
No, thank you.

20:07.311 --> 20:10.378
- What is it?
- The spirits, the spirits...

20:11.822 --> 20:17.866
A spirit's just told me that
you should come up for a little while,

20:18.030 --> 20:21.543
have a drink,
and wait for further instructions.

20:25.966 --> 20:29.894
I'm sorry. Why don't you come up
for a while? I'll be good.

20:31.758 --> 20:32.936
OK.

20:34.447 --> 20:36.453
I tried.

20:36.623 --> 20:40.877
You should always give a woman
two chances to say no, just in case.

20:41.038 --> 20:42.533
That's "no", twice.

20:42.702 --> 20:46.892
All right... but the spirits
are going to be very upset.

20:47.631 --> 20:50.946
You know, I am the Chosen One.

20:58.125 --> 20:59.302
OK.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.167
You <i>will</i> eat.

23:31.945 --> 23:35.295
Get this, and the rest of your playthings,
out of here.

25:20.453 --> 25:21.881
Hey, bird!

25:22.053 --> 25:26.012
Did you just see a little Hare Krishna
midget in a tree, floating?

25:26.819 --> 25:32.733
Or is it me?
That must be Rod Serling.

25:34.148 --> 25:37.311
- Yeah?
- <i> Are you looking for Cheryl Mosely?</i>

25:37.475 --> 25:41.567
- Yeah.
- <i>I know the bastards who grabbed her.</i>

25:41.732 --> 25:45.277
- Who was she with?
- <i>Have you ever been in Pacoima?</i>

25:45.443 --> 25:48.312
- Yeah. Who was she with?
<i>- Behind the freeway there's a house.</i>

25:48.484 --> 25:51.385
<i>It's a pad for some bikers
called the Yellow Dragons.</i>

25:51.555 --> 25:54.173
<i>She was with them last week.
She isn't there now.</i>

25:54.339 --> 25:57.470
Who is this? Hello?

26:31.426 --> 26:33.662
- What is it?
- Nothing.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.813
I came prepared
in case we had any other eventualities.

26:38.978 --> 26:42.360
Listen, you wait here.

26:42.529 --> 26:46.140
If there's a problem, you leave.
Now, what are you going to do?

26:46.305 --> 26:49.273
- I'll stay here.
- No. You stay here now.

26:50.081 --> 26:53.464
If there's a problem,
get behind the wheel and drive away.

26:53.633 --> 26:56.600
- Understand me? You got that?
- Yes.

26:56.770 --> 26:59.191
Stay... leave. OK.

27:23.007 --> 27:25.758
I won't hurt anybody.
I don't want any trouble.

27:25.921 --> 27:32.892
No trouble... I'm sorry,
I just want some chips, that's all.

27:33.054 --> 27:35.925
All I want is chips. A chip, that's it.

27:36.095 --> 27:38.778
Turn that over, it's burning.

27:38.943 --> 27:41.464
I just want some chips.

28:22.079 --> 28:24.761
May I ask you a couple of questions?

29:03.324 --> 29:06.804
- That ought to hold him.
- Yeah, that ought to hold him.

29:08.412 --> 29:12.886
Hey, hey, hey! In my pocket,
there's a whole thing of Tic Tacs.

29:13.052 --> 29:15.386
Take as many as you like. Please.

30:08.217 --> 30:10.356
What are you doing here?

30:11.033 --> 30:12.408
Hey!

30:24.058 --> 30:26.546
I'll bust your brain, asshole!

30:50.650 --> 30:55.122
Why did you come in here?
I told you to stay in the car!

30:55.288 --> 30:58.104
I'm not going to lecture you.
I'm not going to turn this into a lecture,

30:58.264 --> 31:00.752
but next time I tell you
to do something, you do it.

31:00.920 --> 31:05.427
This is a man thing. Man shit happens here.
This is no place for a woman 

31:06.871 --> 31:09.588
Next time I tell you to do something, do it.
I don't want you to get hurt.

31:09.751 --> 31:12.785
- Can I handle this, OK?
- OK.

31:15.928 --> 31:18.066
Leave me alone, asshole.

31:20.375 --> 31:23.822
A girl tattooed with a yellow dragon
was here. What happened to her?

31:23.992 --> 31:25.586
What girl?

31:29.239 --> 31:33.014
- I've never seen her before.
- OK.

31:39.351 --> 31:41.325
Oh, Cheryl!

31:41.495 --> 31:44.145
Yeah, her... We sold her.

31:48.087 --> 31:50.542
What do you mean?
You sold her to who?

31:50.710 --> 31:54.507
To Tommy Tong. He's got that
restaurant down on Broadway.

31:54.678 --> 32:01.268
We traded her for a case of cigarettes
and a quart of pork fried rice.

32:01.431 --> 32:04.081
Why would somebody
want to buy somebody?

32:04.245 --> 32:06.547
- He needed a girl.
- For what?

32:06.710 --> 32:11.630
He worked out a deal with the Devil.
He said he needed her blood.

32:16.439 --> 32:20.748
Look, you're going to go over
and rough him up, huh?

32:20.918 --> 32:23.284
Don't tell him I told you.

32:23.446 --> 32:28.202
Why would I do that?
Let me get this right.

32:29.813 --> 32:34.122
- So you sold her?
- Yeah, we sold her.

32:44.244 --> 32:45.870
Wait here.

33:03.667 --> 33:06.124
I'm looking for Tommy Tong.

33:07.571 --> 33:10.440
Stop acting stupid,
the man owns the place, all right?

33:12.371 --> 33:14.672
I'm looking for Tommy Tong.

33:16.883 --> 33:19.950
You don't speak English?
Let me translate it.

33:20.116 --> 33:22.765
Bring Tommy Tong here
or I'll bust your ass.

33:22.930 --> 33:24.621
You understand that?

33:24.788 --> 33:28.749
You see this dead girl? The last time
she was seen alive was with Tong.

33:28.915 --> 33:31.785
Tell Mr Tong that he has a guest
or I'll bust your ass!

33:42.738 --> 33:46.349
Let me show you
how I feel about that karate shit, OK?

34:11.185 --> 34:15.210
How did you do that?
What was that... with the flip?

35:11.983 --> 35:14.765
- You killed him.
- I didn't kill him!

35:14.927 --> 35:17.033
- What happened?
- I don't know.

35:17.199 --> 35:20.811
Maybe the guy cut himself shaving
and bled to death looking for a Kleenex.

35:20.975 --> 35:22.863
Really, I... Hey!

35:23.023 --> 35:26.438
Maybe the guy thought
that I was coming,

35:26.606 --> 35:31.244
got scared and figured, "What the hell?"
And killed himself.

35:34.414 --> 35:36.966
- You buy that?
- No.

35:37.134 --> 35:38.311
Neither do I.

35:38.478 --> 35:41.544
We may be up against
supernatural creatures.

35:41.711 --> 35:42.955
- What?
- Demons.

35:53.965 --> 35:58.372
By the time he finds you,
it will be too late.

36:37.772 --> 36:40.293
<i>You were wise to kill Tommy Tong.</i>

36:40.461 --> 36:43.461
<i>He was weak,
he might have betrayed us.</i>

36:43.628 --> 36:45.003
Thank you, Lord.

36:45.164 --> 36:48.164
<i>But why is the child still alive?</i>

36:48.331 --> 36:50.569
You have no reason to fear him.

36:50.732 --> 36:54.593
He's surrounded at all times
and in all the four directions by evil.

36:54.764 --> 36:57.152
<i>Do not underestimate
the power of good</i>

36:57.323 --> 36:59.843
<i>and do not dismiss
the strength of the child.</i>

37:00.011 --> 37:02.881
<i>Time grows short.
The child will never eat the blood.</i>

37:03.051 --> 37:04.427
What must I do?

37:04.588 --> 37:08.132
<i>Move the child before
the Chosen One draws near.</i>

37:08.300 --> 37:10.983
- And to kill him?
-  The Ajanti Dagger.

37:11.148 --> 37:14.497
<i>It is not of this world.
With it, you could kill the child.</i>

37:14.667 --> 37:18.529
- But it's so well-guarded. How can I...?
<i>- Offer to exchange the child for it.</i>

37:18.698 --> 37:21.666
<i>They can refuse nothing
for his safe return.</i>

37:21.836 --> 37:27.017
<i>Use the Ajanti Dagger.
With it, you need no other evil.</i>

37:27.177 --> 37:30.406
<i>Use the dagger to kill the child.</i>

39:00.134 --> 39:02.787
It's good to see you, Mr Jarrell.

39:07.303 --> 39:10.118
Get your monkey off my back.

39:12.551 --> 39:16.096
Of course. Fu, please retire.

39:16.262 --> 39:18.629
Yeah, Fu. Save it.

39:21.095 --> 39:23.681
Wait a second...

39:23.847 --> 39:28.221
Wait a second, this is a dream.
I'm dreaming! Hey...

39:28.390 --> 39:30.146
Why do you say that?

39:30.310 --> 39:33.277
Because of people like Fu
with his monkey face,

39:33.447 --> 39:35.682
the big-headed guy,
the fat dude and you.

39:35.847 --> 39:38.116
You don't exist, it's a dream.

39:38.278 --> 39:42.107
Perhaps I've had you brought here
to make you a very attractive offer.

39:42.277 --> 39:46.139
Well... I don't think I can accept a proposal
this early in the season.

39:51.685 --> 39:53.596
Thank you.

39:54.182 --> 39:57.953
Has it ever occurred to you how many men
of less worth than yourself...

39:58.054 --> 39:59.996
have obtained so many of life's rewards

40:00.164 --> 40:03.012
while you, who can imagine so much,
have so little?

40:03.173 --> 40:07.002
I can't say that it has, I'm not that lucky.
I don't have that much imagination.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.788
I really don't like your attitude.

40:17.956 --> 40:21.436
This is a nice jacket. It's got a
"Morris Day" feel and looks good on you.

40:21.605 --> 40:23.612
And the boots... smoking.

40:26.181 --> 40:29.628
I'll repeat my offer one last time.

40:29.797 --> 40:33.212
I am dreaming, so I can say anything
and get away with it.

40:33.379 --> 40:37.657
So I think I'll say, from my heart...

40:38.852 --> 40:40.957
Kiss my ass.

40:41.124 --> 40:43.196
Kiss my ass!

40:43.875 --> 40:47.072
I can see that it's pointless
talking to you.

40:47.235 --> 40:50.977
Why do you insist on mispronouncing
my name, leaving the "J" silent?

40:51.139 --> 40:55.067
- My name is "Jarrell" with a "J".
- Yes, I know.

40:55.235 --> 40:57.122
My legs are more attractive.

40:57.284 --> 41:01.277
I'm willing to make an exchange.
The child for the Ajanti Dagger.

41:10.179 --> 41:12.993
This is just a reminder of the evening.

41:13.155 --> 41:16.352
Something so that
you will know that you were here.

41:16.515 --> 41:20.442
- You don't feel pain in your dream!
- You'll remember this for a long time.

41:20.610 --> 41:23.576
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

41:23.746 --> 41:28.668
Do you have any methyolate or
mercurochrome, it might get infected?

41:28.834 --> 41:32.608
Tell your friends that
Sardo Numspa sends his greetings.

41:51.361 --> 41:53.432
It's a mistake.

41:56.546 --> 41:58.269
- Kee!
- Chandler!

42:02.913 --> 42:05.301
They've tied you up in toilet paper.

42:05.471 --> 42:08.538
- What are you doing here?
- I have to be here, it's my dream.

42:08.704 --> 42:11.192
Listen, I think
the kid is here somewhere.

42:11.361 --> 42:13.400
- We should find the kid together.
- Yes.

42:13.567 --> 42:17.214
- Afterwards, we could spend some...
...time together!

42:17.377 --> 42:21.435
- Yes, kind of let nature...
...take its course.

42:22.304 --> 42:23.864
Yeah.

42:58.655 --> 43:00.510
So, it is Sardo Numspa.

43:01.408 --> 43:05.913
- What's this knife?
- The Crossed Dagger of Ajanti.

43:06.589 --> 43:11.227
They brought it to this world
to kill the second Golden Child,

43:11.390 --> 43:13.943
the Bearer of Justice.

43:14.110 --> 43:16.695
His death was a great loss.

43:16.861 --> 43:21.651
Sardo needs it to kill the child,
but you can only use it to save him.

43:21.822 --> 43:26.644
You must obtain the knife and
lure Numspa into freeing the child.

43:26.814 --> 43:30.588
You must never let him
get possession of the knife.

43:30.749 --> 43:33.170
That sounds like a neat trick.
How can I pull it off?

43:38.174 --> 43:41.718
If need be, we will exchange
the dagger for the child.

43:41.886 --> 43:44.220
If the Abbot of Karma Tang
will let us have it.

43:44.382 --> 43:48.724
If the kid's so important, why
doesn't this guy give you the dagger?

43:48.894 --> 43:51.379
He's a very difficult man.

43:52.701 --> 43:56.181
Tomorrow, you will go with
Kee Nang to Tibet to obtain the dagger.

43:56.348 --> 44:00.822
I ain't going to Tibet because I had
a crazy dream. This is ridiculous.

44:00.989 --> 44:03.989
- Only the Chosen One can get the knife.
- Will you go?

44:07.165 --> 44:11.704
Listen, this Chosen One thing
is going too far, OK?

44:11.868 --> 44:14.901
This is not normal, OK?

44:15.068 --> 44:17.107
I'm not saying no,
but I have to think it over,

44:17.275 --> 44:20.952
because the Chosen One thing...
too far.

44:21.116 --> 44:24.247
- Could you leave us for a moment?
- Yes, you talk it over.

44:24.411 --> 44:26.964
This is not a normal thing
and it should be discussed.

44:27.131 --> 44:29.684
Because it's not normal. Talk.

44:29.852 --> 44:34.970
Chosen One, I'm the Chosen One...
Why...? Tibet...

44:36.091 --> 44:38.480
Why can't I be chosen
to go to the Bahamas?

44:38.651 --> 44:42.480
I've got to get chosen to go to Tibet.
This is really...

44:42.650 --> 44:46.580
And Kala, you're not a normal chick.
You're too shy and need to open up.

44:46.747 --> 44:48.885
You can't sit in a basement,
naked, smoking,

44:49.053 --> 44:52.346
looking at soap operas
for the rest of your life.

45:10.330 --> 45:13.330
- Yak loin.
- What is it?

45:13.499 --> 45:19.892
- Yak loin. Good to keep the Yang up.
- Nothing wrong with my Yang.

45:24.410 --> 45:26.798
How does
this dream transmission work?

45:26.970 --> 45:30.679
- Part's dream and part's real.
- So the scar on my arm's real?

45:30.842 --> 45:32.117
Right.

45:32.281 --> 45:35.315
- What about "Numsy"?
- Numspa. Sardo Numspa.

45:35.482 --> 45:37.270
- Yes.
- He's very real.

45:37.434 --> 45:40.565
You were there and said things
that seemed pretty real.

45:40.730 --> 45:43.576
- That part was dream.
- Just checking.

45:55.864 --> 45:57.773
Aren't you going to ask me up?

46:01.561 --> 46:04.462
- Am I dreaming now?
- Does a lady have to ask twice?

46:04.633 --> 46:08.561
No! No... Please, twice!

46:08.728 --> 46:10.004
Please, please.

46:10.168 --> 46:12.373
Shit! Twice!

46:20.919 --> 46:26.070
I didn't know whether you wanted
cream or sugar, so I left it black.

46:26.232 --> 46:29.526
I want you to go to Tibet.
Will you go?

46:29.687 --> 46:33.398
Wait a second. It's really cold in Tibet,
and I don't like the cold.

46:33.558 --> 46:37.814
Why don't we just stay here
all weekend long under the covers,

46:37.976 --> 46:41.750
watching television, sweating,
smiling and everything?

46:41.911 --> 46:45.107
- You won't go.
- It's freezing in Tibet.

46:45.270 --> 46:48.882
- Hey, where are you going?
- Tibet.

46:49.047 --> 46:53.040
But I'm the Chosen One.
You can't get the knife.

46:59.030 --> 47:01.616
I'll go. I'll go to Tibet.

47:02.646 --> 47:04.336
Wait...

47:04.503 --> 47:08.081
But if it's really cold,
we have to come back here. OK?

47:09.846 --> 47:12.498
You are not in a rush
to leave this minute, are you?

47:12.662 --> 47:15.084
Because, you know...

47:19.542 --> 47:22.292
A bed! Is that a bed?

48:11.124 --> 48:13.197
Kathmandu is the gateway to Tibet.

48:13.364 --> 48:16.048
There are bulls walking around here.
And it's cold.

48:16.212 --> 48:19.080
Two days into the mountains
and we'll be at the heights of heaven.

48:19.251 --> 48:24.172
I thought this was the best part.
I'm freezing, I'm not enjoying myself.

48:24.340 --> 48:27.536
But I want you to know
that I'll do my best to find the child.

48:27.699 --> 48:31.626
Of course you are. I'll arrange
for our trek into the mountains.

48:31.794 --> 48:34.381
You have about an hour to look around.

49:17.265 --> 49:20.526
About 16:30,
but I won't make it to the party.

50:00.592 --> 50:02.217
Hi.

50:06.703 --> 50:09.092
Take it easy.

50:10.063 --> 50:15.018
You want me to buy a necklace?
OK, I'll buy one.

50:15.184 --> 50:18.086
I'll buy one.
Can you let me have the blue one?

50:18.255 --> 50:21.387
I don't know
how much they cost, though.

50:22.159 --> 50:24.810
One of those? OK.

50:24.975 --> 50:28.073
Let me have the blue one,
it matches my coat.

50:34.383 --> 50:37.066
Wait a second, you took 100!

50:37.230 --> 50:42.119
No, one dollar is for you.
See George Washington?

50:42.287 --> 50:44.228
That's Benjamin Franklin,
that's not happening.

50:44.398 --> 50:46.766
Give this... You got the wrong money.

50:50.734 --> 50:53.483
Can I have my money back?

50:54.861 --> 51:00.393
- You gave me the wrong necklace, too.
- You're breaking my heart, asswipe.

51:00.558 --> 51:04.452
- You speak English just fine.
- So do you, so what of it?

51:04.621 --> 51:08.811
Give me my 100 back, take this dollar
and give me the right one.

51:08.974 --> 51:12.681
Monkey breath, puke face,
eater of turtle slime.

51:15.020 --> 51:18.283
- Give me my shit and take your shit.
- What, scuzzbucket?

51:18.445 --> 51:20.617
OK, you slick shithead.

51:20.780 --> 51:23.236
You sneaky little bastard!

51:23.404 --> 51:25.738
You want your money? Take it!

51:47.276 --> 51:50.572
Did you see a little naked man
with a $100 bill?

51:50.731 --> 51:53.349
I have arranged for
yaks, ponies and boats.

51:53.516 --> 51:56.068
You didn't see a naked bum
with $100?

51:56.236 --> 51:59.018
No, but I can arrange for one. Come on.

51:59.179 --> 52:03.587
You've got to show up sooner or later.
When you do, your ass is kicked.

52:03.756 --> 52:08.491
I'll sell your clothes, leave you here
naked and bleeding without money.

52:08.652 --> 52:11.848
Little dirty bastard!
Dude took my money.

52:15.851 --> 52:18.665
If that bum hadn't taken my $100,
we'd have a boat with a motor.

52:18.827 --> 52:21.959
- Shut up and paddle.
- Yeah, I'm gonna paddle.

52:22.122 --> 52:26.050
I'm gonna paddle your ass
when I find you. I'll use this row.

52:26.218 --> 52:29.186
I'm gonna row your ass till it bleeds!

52:41.611 --> 52:46.694
- We'll be there soon.
- You'd better have a spatula.

52:46.858 --> 52:48.898
My ass is frozen to this yak.

53:31.784 --> 53:33.191
Bow.

53:39.081 --> 53:41.764
That's the dude who took my money!

53:49.288 --> 53:53.564
We have come to ask for
the sacred Crossed Dagger of Ajanti.

53:53.735 --> 53:58.012
- For what reason?
- For the Golden Child.

53:58.183 --> 54:02.787
- He does not need it.
- To save his life.

54:02.951 --> 54:07.043
The child lives for our sakes,
not for his own.

54:07.207 --> 54:11.134
I humbly beg you,
let us have the knife.

54:13.927 --> 54:16.608
Let him ask it.

54:25.925 --> 54:29.471
I-I-I... want the knife.

54:37.094 --> 54:39.549
Let him ask again.

54:52.070 --> 54:56.444
I want the knife.

54:57.284 --> 54:59.553
Please.

55:14.469 --> 55:17.087
Only a man whose heart is pure
can wield the knife.

55:17.253 --> 55:20.480
If you're such a man,
you will have it.

55:22.437 --> 55:26.593
"Only a man whose heart is pure
can wield the knife."

55:26.757 --> 55:31.034
And only a man whose ass is narrow
can get down these steps.

55:31.205 --> 55:34.521
And if mine is such an ass,
then I shall have it.

55:37.283 --> 55:39.356
Oh, shit.

55:39.524 --> 55:42.143
Beyond the door is a corridor.

55:42.308 --> 55:45.787
At the other end
is the sacred Ajanti Dagger.

55:45.955 --> 55:50.145
If you walk to the other end of
the corridor and retrieve it, it's yours.

55:50.308 --> 55:53.440
- That sounds simple enough.
- Just one thing.

55:53.603 --> 55:56.385
You must carry this glass of water
without spilling one drop.

55:56.547 --> 55:59.841
Are you Monty Hall now?
You must be Carol Marrow.

56:00.003 --> 56:02.818
"Don't spill any water."
This is crazy!

56:02.979 --> 56:05.849
And keep your thought
as pure as the water.

56:06.019 --> 56:08.605
- The water isn't pure.
- Neither are you!

56:08.771 --> 56:12.600
I give you this advice. Stay on the path.

56:13.635 --> 56:15.260
You've got it.

56:19.202 --> 56:22.105
I'm so afraid of the dark, too.

56:37.794 --> 56:41.655
You need to get somebody
to come and clean up down here!

57:05.634 --> 57:10.139
This is a piece of cake.
This is a piece of cake, OK?

57:15.745 --> 57:18.265
Come on, come on...

57:23.809 --> 57:26.623
Hey, there's no floor.
There's no ground.

57:26.783 --> 57:28.922
Wait a minute, I've got it.

57:29.088 --> 57:32.917
There is a ground. You're making it
look like there's no ground,

57:33.088 --> 57:37.626
to see if I would be scared
and run back.

57:38.847 --> 57:42.163
There's a ground, Monty!

58:02.141 --> 58:05.274
There's no ground here!

58:05.439 --> 58:07.445
Oh, shit...

58:20.222 --> 58:26.236
<i>- Remember, stay on the path!
- I heard you the first time!</i>

58:26.398 --> 58:29.529
Let's just hope the path stays under me!

59:04.924 --> 59:08.340
<i>- But I was supposed to stay on the path!
- Yes.</i>

59:08.509 --> 59:11.225
<i>But you must know
when to break the rules.</i>

59:11.388 --> 59:15.066
- How many have survived this test?
<i>- None!</i>

59:16.093 --> 59:17.882
None?

59:18.429 --> 59:23.001
None? I'm going to break your ass,
when I get out of here.

01:00:21.369 --> 01:00:23.955
What am I doing wrong?

01:00:24.602 --> 01:00:27.472
I followed all your rules,
what am I doing wrong?

01:00:31.226 --> 01:00:35.381
Keep your thoughts as pure
as the water and don't drop the water.

01:00:35.545 --> 01:00:38.033
Don't drop the water.

01:00:39.897 --> 01:00:42.679
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

01:00:42.842 --> 01:00:45.710
The water...
The fire and the water...

01:00:45.881 --> 01:00:47.573
OK.

01:00:52.408 --> 01:00:53.815
To Monty!

01:00:54.777 --> 01:00:56.566
A toast!

01:01:15.959 --> 01:01:20.237
I've got the knife,
now turn on the goddamn light!

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.065
What is it, asswipe?

01:01:38.039 --> 01:01:41.138
I want to ask your advice
about something.

01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:45.077
I'll let that slide,
because it's your way.

01:01:45.815 --> 01:01:48.270
Don't press your luck, though.

01:01:52.728 --> 01:01:56.916
I know that you're
a very old and wise and...

01:01:57.846 --> 01:01:59.820
...disgusting guy.

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:03.572
You'll wipe that on yourjacket, huh?

01:02:03.734 --> 01:02:07.792
I was wondering what a man says
to a woman from your world,

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:12.366
when he wants her to understand that
he loves her and wants to marry her.

01:02:13.206 --> 01:02:17.460
If you took the short path and reached
enlightenment before tomorrow,

01:02:17.622 --> 01:02:20.556
who wouldn't want you for a husband?

01:02:20.726 --> 01:02:25.003
- What's the short path?
- First of all, you must remain pure.

01:02:25.173 --> 01:02:28.719
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

01:02:33.814 --> 01:02:36.114
Oh, you mean no...

01:02:39.477 --> 01:02:43.252
- Is there a long way?
- It takes 10,000 lifetimes.

01:02:43.413 --> 01:02:46.892
We don't have that much time.
No women, what else?

01:02:47.061 --> 01:02:52.811
For you? You must trust someone
you have no reason to trust.

01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:56.874
You must make a promise
to someone you have just met.

01:02:57.045 --> 01:02:59.948
You must love someone
who loves you.

01:03:02.867 --> 01:03:07.407
- How can I know when to do all that?
- That's for you to decide.

01:03:08.691 --> 01:03:12.402
You must tell no one
that I have put you on the path.

01:03:14.868 --> 01:03:18.697
Well, thanks for your help.

01:03:18.868 --> 01:03:21.519
He thinks I helped him!

01:03:22.644 --> 01:03:27.215
Get that booger off your jacket before
it freezes and you scratch yourself.

01:03:29.427 --> 01:03:34.184
Keep that $100. There's no telling what
might be on the bill, when you return it!

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:50.793
Gompa? I have ruined myself
for the American.

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:53.962
- He's a fool.
- But he's brave.

01:03:54.131 --> 01:03:57.905
- He's irresponsible.
- But he's generous.

01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:02.705
He thinks of nothing
but protecting his own feelings.

01:04:04.339 --> 01:04:08.331
But if you touch his heart,
there's nothing he wouldn't do for you.

01:04:08.498 --> 01:04:10.766
He believes in nothing.

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:14.093
And still he does what is right.

01:04:14.257 --> 01:04:17.257
He's a careless,
thoughtless, undisciplined fool.

01:04:17.426 --> 01:04:22.793
Yes. I do like him very much.
It's very hard not to.

01:04:23.921 --> 01:04:26.888
Those magnificent Americans.

01:04:27.057 --> 01:04:31.051
So much power and so little
understanding of what to do with it.

01:04:32.592 --> 01:04:35.243
What should I do?

01:04:37.105 --> 01:04:40.879
You must help him
save the Golden Child.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.302
And follow your heart.

01:04:46.193 --> 01:04:50.185
- Thank you, Gompa.
- You're welcome, Daughter.

01:04:51.792 --> 01:04:56.047
And when you want to marry him,
you have my blessing.

01:04:57.008 --> 01:04:59.048
Thank you, Father.

01:05:07.632 --> 01:05:09.835
They won't let me on the plane
with the knife.

01:05:09.999 --> 01:05:13.261
- Yes, they will.
- No, they won't. I'm going to jail.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:17.289
Thank you.

01:05:17.456 --> 01:05:23.086
This won't work, and I'll spend the rest
of my life in a clay cell in Kathmandu.

01:05:23.248 --> 01:05:26.663
- Another cow?
- It's Kathmandu, what do you expect?

01:05:26.831 --> 01:05:32.069
There's no way they'll let me
on the plane with a knife under my shirt.

01:05:32.239 --> 01:05:34.661
Relax and trust in your destiny.

01:05:34.832 --> 01:05:37.068
- Come on.
- You trust in your destiny.

01:05:38.255 --> 01:05:40.458
- Come with me.
- I have nothing to declare.

01:05:40.623 --> 01:05:43.557
- But necessary.
- Why? I can show you my bag here.

01:05:43.727 --> 01:05:46.445
- For your own protection.
- These are just my drawers.

01:05:46.607 --> 01:05:48.779
These are clean
and those are dirty.

01:05:48.943 --> 01:05:52.652
Excuse me, I have a plane to catch.
Come on, hurry up.

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:54.854
- What's this?
- Nothing.

01:05:55.022 --> 01:06:00.618
Just once I want to go back to America.
I'm a citizen. What are you looking at?

01:06:00.781 --> 01:06:05.288
It just does my heart good
to see another American citizen.

01:06:08.654 --> 01:06:10.508
- Hold it!
- Are you crazy?

01:06:10.669 --> 01:06:16.780
No, I'm Agent Jarrell from the American
Stolen Artefacts Foundation.

01:06:16.941 --> 01:06:20.802
Everybody, it's OK! I'm with
the Stolen Artefacts Foundation!

01:06:20.972 --> 01:06:23.842
Freddie, get out of my sight!
You make me sick!

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:26.828
I'll talk to you on the plane.
Nobody be alarmed!

01:06:26.989 --> 01:06:30.535
I'm Chandler Jarrell,
American Stolen Artefacts Foundation.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:34.279
Thanks to you, we were able
to catch this man, Freddie,

01:06:34.446 --> 01:06:36.550
the piece of shit back there.

01:06:36.716 --> 01:06:39.467
I thank the good people of Nepal.

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:42.017
You're all brilliant. Thank you, sir.

01:06:42.189 --> 01:06:48.614
You are one hell of a leader.
The cunningness... the instinct...

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:52.042
The instinct is brilliant. I can tell
that you trained under this man.

01:06:52.204 --> 01:06:54.506
You have the same glare of brilliance
in your eye.

01:06:54.668 --> 01:06:57.450
You didn't know what you did,
but you're brilliant.

01:06:57.611 --> 01:07:01.059
The best brilliance is born
from someone ignorant...

01:07:02.955 --> 01:07:05.606
Forget it.
This is my assistant, Kee Nang.

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:10.244
We thank you all.
People of Nepal, we thank you!

01:07:10.411 --> 01:07:13.346
You're a bunch of
beautiful, brilliant people.

01:07:13.515 --> 01:07:16.133
Nepal! N-E-P-A-L!

01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:18.404
Viva Nepal! Viva Nepal!

01:07:30.507 --> 01:07:31.936
No, thanks.

01:08:10.026 --> 01:08:12.196
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

01:08:12.362 --> 01:08:14.696
Hey. This is your problem, now.

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:17.639
Thank you. You did a marvellous job
in obtaining the knife.

01:08:20.298 --> 01:08:24.420
You will be spending the next few days
at the house of a certain friend.

01:08:24.584 --> 01:08:27.040
When will we be contacted
about the knife?

01:08:31.337 --> 01:08:35.974
That's him. If he doesn't return
my property, I want him arrested.

01:08:41.192 --> 01:08:44.770
Welcome home, Mr Jarrell.
You have something for me.

01:08:50.854 --> 01:08:54.173
I'm sorry, Numsy.
I should be punished!

01:08:54.343 --> 01:08:57.377
Everyone, I have stolen
from my brother, Numsy.

01:08:57.544 --> 01:09:00.576
Officer, it's your duty to take me in.
Please, purge me.

01:09:00.743 --> 01:09:03.776
I'm ashamed of myself.
I should be arrested.

01:09:03.943 --> 01:09:06.661
I should be purged,
I should be flogged.

01:09:06.823 --> 01:09:09.604
- I shouldn't walk among good people.
- Let me talk to him.

01:09:09.768 --> 01:09:13.564
I'm a swine, a wretch.
I don't deserve to live like others.

01:09:13.734 --> 01:09:16.582
How long do you think you can
 keep up this miserable masquerade?

01:09:16.743 --> 01:09:20.768
Until I get arrested, or you realise
the rules of evidence in this country.

01:09:20.934 --> 01:09:24.763
If I get arrested, they'll take me
and put me in a jail cell.

01:09:24.934 --> 01:09:30.596
They'll take the knife, because it's stolen,
and put an "Exhibit A" sticker on it.

01:09:30.759 --> 01:09:34.881
The knife sits in a room
and I sit in my little room

01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:38.340
until the trial comes up
a month to a year later.

01:09:38.502 --> 01:09:42.430
If you get me arrested, there's no telling
when you'll get your knife.

01:09:47.014 --> 01:09:49.251
You have no idea who I am, have you?

01:09:49.415 --> 01:09:53.406
Yes! You're Sardo Numsy!

01:09:54.438 --> 01:09:58.715
I don't care who you are. I do care
that you kidnapped a kid, though.

01:09:58.885 --> 01:10:01.602
I could destroy you just like that.

01:10:02.917 --> 01:10:06.049
We wouldn't want that. Listen...

01:10:06.212 --> 01:10:08.734
Bring me the boy
and I'll give you the knife.

01:10:08.901 --> 01:10:11.651
Then no one will have
to be destroyed "just like that".

01:10:12.613 --> 01:10:14.555
Think it over.

01:10:14.725 --> 01:10:16.546
My brother's forgiven me!

01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:20.484
Kee, Dr Hong,
Brother Numsy has forgiven me.

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:25.377
Dear brother!
Thank you, you're wonderful!

01:10:25.541 --> 01:10:28.737
- What else did you tell him?
- That I wouldn't be as polite next time.

01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:33.090
- You are foolhardy, aren't you?
- Well, I do my best.

01:11:23.171 --> 01:11:25.920
Are you coming to bed?

01:11:28.259 --> 01:11:30.745
No, I think I'm going to sleep out here.

01:11:33.474 --> 01:11:35.035
Oh...

01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:37.919
Good night.

01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:31.616
I just heard something.

01:12:32.513 --> 01:12:35.098
I don't like this. Let's get out of here.

01:13:26.493 --> 01:13:28.020
Run!

01:14:19.292 --> 01:14:23.002
I did not spend the night with you
to obligate you.

01:14:23.164 --> 01:14:27.158
I spent the night with you
because I love you.

01:14:38.972 --> 01:14:42.683
- She is beyond this world of pain.
- You can save her.

01:14:44.059 --> 01:14:46.296
The Golden Child can bring her back.

01:14:46.459 --> 01:14:49.012
As long as sunlight
still shines on her body...

01:14:49.179 --> 01:14:51.962
No more magic and riddles.
She's dead!

01:14:58.074 --> 01:15:01.075
You are the Chosen One.
You will find the child.

01:15:01.243 --> 01:15:04.472
You have until nightfall to find him.
Sardo can't kill him until dark.

01:18:46.066 --> 01:18:48.270
We'll get you out of here, OK?

01:19:00.627 --> 01:19:02.514
Where's your boss?

01:19:02.675 --> 01:19:05.259
Keep an eye on the kid.
Don't worry, I'm the Chosen One.

01:19:05.426 --> 01:19:06.702
This won't take long.

01:19:10.483 --> 01:19:12.555
My dear, sweet brother Numsy!

01:19:21.267 --> 01:19:25.161
I can see that you're busy right now.
I'll come back some other time.

01:19:38.739 --> 01:19:40.745
There are no keys in the car!

01:19:41.841 --> 01:19:44.393
Come on, come on!

01:19:48.785 --> 01:19:51.152
- Everything's going to be OK.
- I know.

01:19:51.313 --> 01:19:53.550
Fasten your seatbelt, kid.

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:09.735
Did somebody give you a Valium,
or what?

01:20:13.905 --> 01:20:17.613
This must happen a lot where
you're from. I'm gonna shit on myself!

01:20:42.991 --> 01:20:44.453
Hey, Goldie!

01:20:46.095 --> 01:20:49.925
You ain't going to help me with
the chain, just keep running, right?

01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:57.670
Hey, wait!

01:25:04.038 --> 01:25:06.274
- How long are you going to be?
- Two weeks.

01:25:06.438 --> 01:25:09.437
- You drop the kid off and come back.
- Yes!

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:11.012
Good!

01:25:11.173 --> 01:25:14.044
Listen, I bought this for you.

01:25:14.214 --> 01:25:18.785
You put that on and no one will mess
with your head while you're here.

01:25:18.949 --> 01:25:20.738
Good? Good.

01:25:20.899 --> 01:25:23.835
You don't want to go to Tibet
with a big... on your head.

01:25:26.373 --> 01:25:29.788
That is a cool trick. Did you ever
think about going into show business?

01:25:29.957 --> 01:25:32.291
I could be your partner,
I'd throw a rock at you,

01:25:32.452 --> 01:25:36.347
