00:32.800 --> 00:34.640
&lrm;Well? With or without?

00:34.760 --> 00:35.760
&lrm;[hesitantly] With?

00:35.880 --> 00:37.560
&lrm;You're sure it's not better without?

00:37.720 --> 00:39.280
&lrm;Either way, you look perfect.

00:39.400 --> 00:43.280
&lrm;It's not every day you celebrate
&lrm;your 20th wedding anniversary.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.040
&lrm;[father] Marinette! Can you come here?

00:49.080 --> 00:49.920
&lrm;Well?

00:50.920 --> 00:51.760
&lrm;Well what?

00:52.080 --> 00:53.640
&lrm;My moustache, I groomed it.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.600
&lrm;Is it too short? Should I shave it off?

00:55.760 --> 00:56.720
&lrm;Is it crooked?

00:57.040 --> 00:59.840
&lrm;You look perfect, dad...
&lrm;Except for one thing.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.120
&lrm;Thanks, sweetheart.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.080
&lrm;No problem, dad.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.960
&lrm;You're going to be late.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.600
&lrm;Mrs. Chamack is coming to pick up
&lrm;her Eiffel Tower cake

01:10.720 --> 01:12.760
&lrm;in 30 minutes. I'm depending on you.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.160
&lrm;Yeah, yeah, no sweat, piece of cake.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.680
&lrm;[questioning sigh]

01:18.480 --> 01:21.480
&lrm;Married 20 years...
&lrm;pretty cool isn't it, Tikki?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.680
&lrm;Time flies when you're having fun.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.960
&lrm;Not when you're doing homework.

01:26.080 --> 01:26.920
&lrm;[Tikki chuckles]

01:33.400 --> 01:34.280
&lrm;Hey.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.440
&lrm;They're Marinette's parents,
&lrm;a chick I hang out with.

01:39.640 --> 01:43.120
&lrm;Yes, I remember.
&lrm;They make the best bread in Paris.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.120
&lrm;Couldn't you have made
&lrm;more effort to dress nicely?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.000
&lrm;What d'you mean? I took off my cap.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.320
&lrm;But this is a special day.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.320
&lrm;Well, it's only a birthday.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.720
&lrm;[he tuts] No...

01:55.840 --> 01:57.280
&lrm;This is a special birthday.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.760
&lrm;This family heirloom was made
&lrm;by an ancestor many years ago.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.080
&lrm;It's been passed down
&lrm;through the generations,

02:04.400 --> 02:06.840
&lrm;on the fifteenth birthday, and today,

02:06.960 --> 02:08.639
&lrm;it's your turn to inherit it.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.520
&lrm;It's sweet, but I've already got a watch,

02:11.640 --> 02:12.800
&lrm;synched to my phone.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.800
&lrm;Sometimes, there's more to things
&lrm;than meets the eye.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.760
&lrm;Let's just say our ancestor was...

02:18.480 --> 02:20.440
&lrm;[twinkling]

02:21.800 --> 02:23.200
&lrm;ahead of his time.

02:24.640 --> 02:25.880
&lrm;Of course, I'd understand

02:26.000 --> 02:29.280
&lrm;if you'd rather me buy you
&lrm;a new pair of rollerblades.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.120
&lrm;No, dad, I'm stoked.
&lrm;It's awesome, thank you.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.640
&lrm;[her phone rings]

02:34.880 --> 02:36.480
&lrm;Are your friends waiting?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.560
&lrm;Yeah, but I don't want
&lrm;to bail on you, it's cool.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.200
&lrm;No, no, go ahead.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.240
&lrm;Now take good care of it.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.640
&lrm;Yeah.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.600
&lrm;Come on, Marinette, you can do it.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.480
&lrm;Just remember the formula.
&lrm;Think, Marinette.

02:52.640 --> 02:56.280
&lrm;I might be able to if you weren't
&lrm;distracting me.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.920
&lrm;Hey, Alya. What's up?

03:02.800 --> 03:03.880
&lrm;The what?

03:04.320 --> 03:06.600
&lrm;The bet between Alix and Kim?

03:06.720 --> 03:08.520
&lrm;No, of course I didn't forget.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.200
&lrm;I've made the banner.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.320
&lrm;I know everyone's counting on me.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.600
&lrm;In five minutes?

03:13.920 --> 03:17.040
&lrm;No sweat. I'm on my way already.
&lrm;Be right there.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.280
&lrm;But you have to wait for Mrs. Chamack.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.560
&lrm;I've 20 minutes before she arrives.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.520
&lrm;I told them I'd do the banner.
&lrm;They're counting on me.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.640
&lrm;Besides, Adrien will be there.

03:30.040 --> 03:34.160
&lrm;You'll never make it to Trocadéro
&lrm;in five minutes, it's too far.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.960
&lrm;Not too far for Ladybug.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.360
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

03:39.560 --> 03:41.600
&lrm;[whooshing]

03:56.240 --> 03:57.760
&lrm;That's beautiful.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.160
&lrm;Impressive, Marinette.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.600
&lrm;You've picked the wrong side.
&lrm;Alix hasn't even shown up.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.160
&lrm;Probably too chicken
&lrm;to race an athlete like me.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.080
&lrm;[Alix] Spoke too soon, Kim.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.440
&lrm;Your ridiculous bets are over.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.520
&lrm;I'm gonna leave you in the dust, meathead.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.480
&lrm;You're no match for me.
&lrm;My neck's bigger than your thigh.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.959
&lrm;Is that a good thing?

04:21.480 --> 04:23.360
&lrm;Let's review the official rules.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.760
&lrm;Two laps around the fountains,

04:25.880 --> 04:27.000
&lrm;approximately 500 yards.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.720
&lrm;The first over the line is the victor.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.320
&lrm;If Kim wins, Alix will relinquish
&lrm;her rollerblades to him.

04:33.480 --> 04:34.520
&lrm;If Alix wins,

04:34.680 --> 04:36.600
&lrm;Kim will be prohibited
&lrm;from making any dares

04:36.760 --> 04:38.480
&lrm;for the rest of the school year.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.600
&lrm;We're through with those stupid dares.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.760
&lrm;-Yeah, that's right!
&lrm;-No more dares!

04:43.160 --> 04:44.120
&lrm;On your marks.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.240
&lrm;Get set...

04:46.800 --> 04:47.680
&lrm;Hold up!

04:47.800 --> 04:50.560
&lrm;[he groans, the crowd giggles]

04:50.680 --> 04:51.960
&lrm;Forfeiting already?

04:52.720 --> 04:55.240
&lrm;Hold on to this, Alya.
&lrm;I don't want to drop it.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.520
&lrm;Hold on, girl. I can't. I...

04:58.760 --> 05:01.240
&lrm;Guard it with your life.
&lrm;It's a family heirloom.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.600
&lrm;But...

05:04.080 --> 05:06.840
&lrm;Marinette, take this.
&lrm;I gotta record the race for my blog.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.040
&lrm;On your marks.

05:10.080 --> 05:10.960
&lrm;Get set.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.240
&lrm;Go!

05:19.120 --> 05:22.960
&lrm;But she asked you to look after it.
&lrm;I've gotta hold the banner.

05:27.720 --> 05:28.680
&lrm;Need any help?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.800
&lrm;Wh...? Yep, thanks,

05:30.920 --> 05:33.040
&lrm;Gotta be careful,
&lrm;even if you are amazing...

05:34.160 --> 05:36.640
&lrm;At... holding things... in your hands.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.200
&lrm;[cheering]

05:39.640 --> 05:40.880
&lrm;Last lap.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.920
&lrm;Amazing at holding things?

05:44.120 --> 05:46.520
&lrm;Adrikins? Whatcha got there?

05:46.640 --> 05:48.560
&lrm;Some super-old case or something?

05:48.720 --> 05:49.840
&lrm;Careful, it's Alix's.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.200
&lrm;If it's Alix's, it's probably worthless.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.520
&lrm;Give it back to Adrien, Chloé.

06:07.920 --> 06:08.800
&lrm;Yeah!

06:13.360 --> 06:14.360
&lrm;I call a rematch.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.520
&lrm;That false start threw me off.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.000
&lrm;Did you do this?

06:24.840 --> 06:27.520
&lrm;I had to record the race,
&lrm;so I gave it to Marinette.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.520
&lrm;She had the banner
&lrm;so she gave it to Adrien.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.120
&lrm;Then Chloé snatched it and dropped it.

06:32.320 --> 06:33.720
&lrm;Then you skated over it.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.160
&lrm;My old man gave me this for my birthday.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.800
&lrm;This watch is totally a family heirloom.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.960
&lrm;It was an accident.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.280
&lrm;We didn't mean any harm.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.520
&lrm;As if... I totally had nothing
&lrm;to do with this.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.000
&lrm;You're all to blame!

06:48.800 --> 06:49.920
&lrm;[she sobs]

06:57.880 --> 06:59.080
&lrm;Alix, wait!

06:59.280 --> 07:02.880
&lrm;-Marinette, what about the cake?
&lrm;-There's still time. Hide.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.040
&lrm;[evil voice] Such disappointment,

07:10.240 --> 07:12.600
&lrm;frustration, and negativity.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.880
&lrm;How it fills my heart with exhilaration.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.160
&lrm;Fly away, my little Akuma and evilize her.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.360
&lrm;Bon appetit.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.960
&lrm;[phone rings]

07:46.760 --> 07:48.120
&lrm;It's Mrs. Chamack.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.880
&lrm;-Hello.
<i>&lrm;-Hi, I'm at the bakery,</i>

07:50.000 --> 07:52.840
<i>&lrm;-but it's closed. I need my cake now.</i>
&lrm;-I know you do.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.600
&lrm;My daughter's home.
&lrm;She must be upstairs.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.320
&lrm;I'll phone her now.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.120
&lrm;Maybe we could fix it.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.240
&lrm;This watch was sick, one of a kind.
&lrm;It can't be fixed!

08:05.560 --> 08:08.360
&lrm;There has to be a way
&lrm;to get it back to how it was.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.560
&lrm;Like, how?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.560
&lrm;Go back in time and change the future?

08:12.040 --> 08:14.480
&lrm;When you figure out how, lemme know!

08:16.200 --> 08:17.960
&lrm;[phone rings]

08:19.840 --> 08:22.000
&lrm;Oh no, this can't be good.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.120
&lrm;Hello, dad.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.640
&lrm;Timebreaker, I'm Hawk Moth.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.320
&lrm;I'm granting you the power to retaliate

08:35.440 --> 08:37.039
&lrm;against the people who've wronged you,

08:37.520 --> 08:40.159
&lrm;and to go back in time
&lrm;to restore the future.

08:40.559 --> 08:44.159
&lrm;But you must do me a favor in return
&lrm;when the time is right.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.160
&lrm;You got it, Hawk Moth.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.400
<i>&lrm;Mrs. Chamack is outside</i>
<i>&lrm;waiting for her cake.</i>

08:49.560 --> 08:52.520
&lrm;I gotta go. Can't keep her waiting.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.000
&lrm;She was listening to music.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.520
&lrm;Run!

09:09.960 --> 09:12.280
&lrm;Stop, Alix! What are you doing?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.320
&lrm;The name's Timebreaker now.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.880
&lrm;I'm going back in time to save my watch,

09:17.000 --> 09:18.840
&lrm;using you punks to do it.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.280
&lrm;Go back in time?
&lrm;What did you do? Why is he fading?

09:22.600 --> 09:23.680
&lrm;I needed his energy.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.440
&lrm;He was a pain anyway with all those bets.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.880
&lrm;He deserves to disappear forever,
&lrm;and so do you.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.040
&lrm;We've got to transform, now.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.480
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

09:50.000 --> 09:51.080
&lrm;Yeah!

10:13.760 --> 10:15.000
&lrm;Time out, Timebreaker.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.720
&lrm;Please, help me.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.760
&lrm;I'm messed up, please, please,

10:20.000 --> 10:21.240
&lrm;No!

10:21.360 --> 10:22.640
&lrm;[cackling]

10:23.200 --> 10:24.280
&lrm;Sweet, Rose,

10:24.400 --> 10:27.000
&lrm;always thinking of others before yourself.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.240
&lrm;One minute.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.520
&lrm;I gotta destroy her Akuma
&lrm;before everyone disappears.

10:32.640 --> 10:33.960
&lrm;Where's is that Cat?

10:35.680 --> 10:36.720
&lrm;Time to transform.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.320
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

10:58.200 --> 10:59.480
&lrm;[she cackles]

11:01.080 --> 11:02.480
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;One and a half minutes.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.720
&lrm;You won't be able to stop me
&lrm;where I'm going, Ladybug.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.480
&lrm;Lemme guess,
&lrm;we're playing tag and you're it?

11:09.840 --> 11:11.200
&lrm;Exactly!

11:11.680 --> 11:12.520
&lrm;Don't let her touch you.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.800
&lrm;Missed me. Just a second too late.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.160
&lrm;No!

11:29.640 --> 11:31.640
&lrm;Well she wastes no time, does she?

11:31.800 --> 11:32.960
&lrm;The more people she freezes,

11:33.080 --> 11:35.400
&lrm;the more minutes she gets
&lrm;to go back in time.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.680
&lrm;Those kids are goners
&lrm;if we don't get that Akuma.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.280
&lrm;Keep your hands to yourself.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.440
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Now, Timebreaker,

11:56.800 --> 11:57.840
&lrm;grab her Miraculous,

11:58.240 --> 11:59.440
&lrm;her earring!

12:03.480 --> 12:05.760
&lrm;Cat Noir, No!

12:07.840 --> 12:12.120
&lrm;Wow, six minutes in one go.
&lrm;Musta been those nine lives.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.160
&lrm;Gotta go, the past is waiting.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.840
&lrm;Timebreaker, the Miraculous!
&lrm;Take his ring before he disappears!

12:21.360 --> 12:22.600
&lrm;Go ahead and try.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.120
&lrm;Chill out, Hawk Moth, I have a sick plan.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.720
&lrm;[Ladybug squeals]

13:04.200 --> 13:06.400
&lrm;Wh-What just happened?

13:06.520 --> 13:07.560
&lrm;[cheering]

13:07.680 --> 13:09.240
&lrm;Go, Alix, yeah!

13:09.600 --> 13:12.320
&lrm;We've gone back in time, haven't we?

13:12.600 --> 13:13.960
&lrm;Watcha got there?

13:14.080 --> 13:15.480
&lrm;Careful, it's Alix's.

13:15.640 --> 13:18.680
&lrm;What is this?
&lrm;Some super-old case or something?

13:18.880 --> 13:20.840
&lrm;If it's Alix's, it's probably worthless.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.720
&lrm;Give it back to Adrien, Chloé.

13:22.840 --> 13:23.960
&lrm;My watch!

13:24.680 --> 13:25.960
&lrm;Chloé, put the watch down!

13:32.840 --> 13:33.720
&lrm;No!

13:36.360 --> 13:38.600
&lrm;Ladybug, this time it's your fault!

13:39.160 --> 13:42.280
&lrm;I need more energy.
&lrm;I've gotta go further back in time.

13:44.280 --> 13:47.760
&lrm;Ladybug, it's all Ladybug's fault!

13:49.440 --> 13:51.440
&lrm;[evil voice] Could this be possible?

13:51.560 --> 13:54.040
&lrm;Do I see double vision in my future?

13:54.360 --> 13:56.680
&lrm;Or should I say "double villain"?

14:03.680 --> 14:07.960
&lrm;Fly away, my devilish Akuma,
&lrm;and join this troubled soul.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.760
&lrm;Everyone, get out of here!
&lrm;Don't let her touch you!

14:20.400 --> 14:21.400
&lrm;Time to transform.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.200
&lrm;[Marinette] Who are you?

14:24.640 --> 14:27.400
&lrm;I don't have time to explain,
&lrm;but I'm you,

14:27.520 --> 14:29.320
&lrm;from a few minutes in the future.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.080
&lrm;She's right.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.200
&lrm;I can feel it.
&lrm;She is you... from the future.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.240
&lrm;Crazy!

14:36.720 --> 14:39.160
&lrm;I know it seems unbelievable
&lrm;but trust me.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.200
&lrm;I mean trust... yourself.

14:41.800 --> 14:45.240
&lrm;And dad's gonna call me,
&lrm;I mean you, in two minutes.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.880
&lrm;He won't be happy because Mrs. Chamack
&lrm;is waiting at the bakery.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.560
&lrm;The cake... But I... I still have...

14:52.000 --> 14:54.800
&lrm;Time? That's what I thought.
&lrm;She'll be early.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.160
&lrm;Just leave now and take care of the cake.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.960
&lrm;Don't worry, Ladybug can handle this.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.560
&lrm;How do I get myself
&lrm;into these crazy situations?

15:12.400 --> 15:13.840
&lrm;Cat Noir, I can't explain now

15:14.000 --> 15:16.040
&lrm;but we've gotta capture
&lrm;Timebreaker's Akuma.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.840
&lrm;Your life depends on it.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.680
&lrm;Which life? I've got nine.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.480
&lrm;I'm serious!
&lrm;The Akuma's in her rollerblades.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.480
&lrm;[Ladybug] We've gotta release it.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.080
&lrm;Am I seeing double?

15:31.240 --> 15:33.080
&lrm;Another thing
&lrm;I don't have time to explain.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.720
&lrm;The energy from these two
&lrm;will be enough for us to go farther back.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.400
&lrm;I want my watch back. Let's do it.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.240
&lrm;Whatever you do, don't let them touch you.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.600
&lrm;Get the Miraculous, Timebreaker!

16:02.240 --> 16:05.320
&lrm;If we were faster,
&lrm;they'd be no match for us.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.720
&lrm;Then let's stock up on more energy first.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.360
&lrm;Then we'll destroy them.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.280
&lrm;Oh, hold on, here she comes now.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.960
&lrm;It's fine, thanks.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.320
&lrm;It's all good.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.760
&lrm;Sorry again for making you wait.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.360
&lrm;[Tikki] Mission accomplished.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.040
&lrm;You mean Mission 1 accomplished.
&lrm;Time for Mission 2.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.160
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

16:43.560 --> 16:44.400
&lrm;Yeah!

17:07.359 --> 17:08.440
&lrm;We've got enough speed.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.200
&lrm;Let's go hardcore on Ladybug and Cat Noir.

17:11.319 --> 17:12.920
&lrm;Once we get their energy,

17:13.200 --> 17:15.079
&lrm;we'll have enough to go back together.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.400
&lrm;And get our watch!

17:17.680 --> 17:19.480
&lrm;I thought we were chasing them.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.520
&lrm;[they yell]

17:26.920 --> 17:28.000
&lrm;Hey, need a hand?

17:28.440 --> 17:29.400
&lrm;Thanks!

17:31.200 --> 17:33.080
&lrm;They're insane on their rollerblades.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.040
&lrm;Unstoppable on the ground.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.560
&lrm;So... what if they're not on the ground?

17:37.800 --> 17:40.560
&lrm;Two Ladybugs? I'm in heaven.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.200
&lrm;We'd better go back now.
&lrm;There'll be less of them.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.160
&lrm;I'm down.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.440
&lrm;Don't fail me this time!

17:49.520 --> 17:51.360
&lrm;[together] They're planning
&lrm;to go back in time again.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.680
&lrm;[together] Lucky charm!

17:58.960 --> 17:59.960
&lrm;[together] Any ideas?

18:00.080 --> 18:03.240
&lrm;While you figure it out,
&lrm;I'll try to buy some time.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.320
&lrm;Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

18:11.440 --> 18:12.400
&lrm;Of course.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.120
&lrm;Cataclysm!

18:32.400 --> 18:33.880
&lrm;Let's freeze her.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.200
&lrm;[panicked cries]

18:43.320 --> 18:45.880
&lrm;We're going too fast! We can't stop!

18:46.760 --> 18:48.680
&lrm;[they yell]

18:49.040 --> 18:50.120
&lrm;Now!

18:55.040 --> 18:56.280
&lrm;[they yell]

19:04.400 --> 19:06.600
&lrm;[together] No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.160
&lrm;[together] Time to de-evilize!

19:15.400 --> 19:16.560
&lrm;[together] Gotcha.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.800
&lrm;[together] Bye-bye, little butterfly.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.440
&lrm;[together] Miraculous ladybug!

19:30.960 --> 19:31.960
&lrm;[together] Pound it.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.480
&lrm;Here, I think this is yours.

19:43.080 --> 19:43.920
&lrm;Sweet!

19:44.040 --> 19:46.040
&lrm;How did you fix it? Thank you.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.200
&lrm;I shouldn't have given it
&lrm;to someone else to look after.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.520
&lrm;It was my responsibility, my bad.

19:51.960 --> 19:55.520
&lrm;Responsibility isn't something
&lrm;to be taken lightly. I should know.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.800
&lrm;You're totally right.
&lrm;I'll be more careful next time.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.200
&lrm;Thanks, Ladybug.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.160
&lrm;I was getting used to having
&lrm;two Ladybugs around.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.920
&lrm;Now you're going
&lrm;to get used to no Ladybugs around.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.880
&lrm;I gotta split before I change back.

20:11.720 --> 20:15.080
&lrm;She'll fall for me someday.
&lrm;It's just a matter of time.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.880
&lrm;You slipped by me this time,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir,

20:19.160 --> 20:22.800
&lrm;but one day, past, present, or future,

20:22.920 --> 20:24.600
&lrm;you will be destroyed,

20:24.960 --> 20:27.000
&lrm;and I'll have your Miraculouses!

20:27.120 --> 20:29.760
&lrm;I will be unstoppable!

20:29.880 --> 20:32.440
&lrm;[he cackles]

20:36.440 --> 20:37.560
&lrm;Hey! So...

20:37.680 --> 20:39.240
&lrm;did you have a nice anniversary?

20:39.360 --> 20:40.400
&lrm;[father] We sure did.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.040
&lrm;Although, it was a close call.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.600
&lrm;Yeah. I'm sorry that I kept her waiting.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.000
&lrm;Next time, please wait in the bakery,

20:51.120 --> 20:53.480
&lrm;not in your room listening to music.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.840
&lrm;Got it. I won't screw up next time.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.320
&lrm;Good, cuz mom's right,

20:57.440 --> 21:01.000
&lrm;there's only one Marinette,
&lrm;and we're counting on her.
