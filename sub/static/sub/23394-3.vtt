WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.541
A toast.

00:02.669 --> 00:05.207
To the beginning
of a fruitful partnership.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.628
We found this.
A bloody fingermark.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.302
I've read about this.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.504
What is my role to be
in all of this?

00:14.640 --> 00:16.347
Perhaps you've already
played it.

00:16.475 --> 00:17.841
May I assume
you have an interest?

00:17.976 --> 00:21.219
It wouldn't be fair to assume
anything about me, Doctor.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.097
I'm seeking information.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.016
What was his name?

00:26.151 --> 00:27.608
The one with the silver smile?

00:50.008 --> 00:51.374
Mr. Van Bergen.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.342
- Sir?
- You may bring the dessert now.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.763
Yes, sir.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.648
Mr. Van Bergen,
there's been an incident.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.141
- An incident?
- Yes.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.269
It involves a boy,
a rather young boy.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.067
Does this have something to do
with Willem?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.742
Um...

01:21.582 --> 01:24.074
The police aren't entirely
certain, Mrs. Van Bergen,

01:24.209 --> 01:29.079
but, um,
inquiries have been made

01:29.214 --> 01:30.625
by persons
outside the department

01:30.757 --> 01:33.625
that could be
cause for concern.

01:33.760 --> 01:38.300
There was a young street urchin
killed up on the bridge.

01:41.143 --> 01:44.181
Your son
is known to have frequented

01:44.313 --> 01:46.350
the disorderly house
where the boy worked,

01:46.481 --> 01:49.519
and it is said that
they were fond of one another.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.517
Enough!

01:59.494 --> 02:00.530
What's this?

02:00.662 --> 02:02.654
Steamed treacle pudding, sir.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.455
Mmm!

02:12.174 --> 02:15.383
I am terribly sorry
to have disturbed your lunch.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.092
But it seems as though

02:17.220 --> 02:20.429
Willem has got himself in water
a bit hotter than usual.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.391
I thought
you should know now.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.180
There's no later.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.705
I don't like it, Tom.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.828
I don't like it one bit.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.420
None of us like it.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.915
Willem's been warned before.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.293
No rough stuff,
not with Biff's girls.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.215
I've had a meeting
with the family,

03:00.347 --> 03:02.555
gave due notice.

03:02.683 --> 03:06.347
We won't let it happen again.

03:06.478 --> 03:07.935
Paulie, don't worry.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.601
Goddamn sodomites.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.483
What about the Moore fella?

03:15.445 --> 03:17.402
I don't think he's gonna be
talking to nobody

03:17.531 --> 03:19.898
about his little visit
to Paresis Hall.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.946
Not if he cares about his
good standing in the community.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.569
Well, you're right
about his standing.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.038
He won't be sitting down
for a week.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.225
Sally?

04:38.153 --> 04:39.153
Aw!

04:41.990 --> 04:43.856
John.

04:43.992 --> 04:44.992
How do you feel?

04:46.620 --> 04:47.701
How did I get here?

04:47.829 --> 04:49.912
You have young Stevie
to thank for that.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.248
He found you wandering about
in an alley

04:52.375 --> 04:53.456
down in the Tenderloin.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.256
You were missing
your trousers.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.214
Christ.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.106
Don't worry.
It can happen to the best of us.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.734
Can I get something
a little stronger, please?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.815
What's all this?
What's going on?

05:17.943 --> 05:20.276
We need someplace
where the walls have no ears.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.894
It will be a gathering point,

05:22.030 --> 05:24.192
a place where revelations
may slip through.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.531
Revelations of what?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.499
Well, let's start with what
you did last night.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.159
You went down
to new Paresis Hall.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.704
Stevie told us that much.

05:35.836 --> 05:39.045
I-I met Sally.

05:39.172 --> 05:43.007
They were friends,
the two of them.

05:43.134 --> 05:48.220
Gloria... Giorgio...
was well liked, she said.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.557
Especially by
the wealthier clients.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.965
That may be the reason
the police

05:53.061 --> 05:55.101
were pressuring the Santorelli
family to keep quiet.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.622
The rich will always
choose dead children

05:57.691 --> 05:58.691
over social scandal.

05:58.817 --> 05:59.817
What else?

05:59.818 --> 06:02.310
Honestly, I-I can recall
very little.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.363
It's not what you think!

06:11.121 --> 06:12.157
What do we think?

06:12.289 --> 06:14.372
You think I...

06:14.499 --> 06:16.741
I told you!

06:16.877 --> 06:18.709
I don't remember!

06:21.339 --> 06:25.174
It is my honor and my privilege
to present these brave men

06:25.302 --> 06:27.669
with the
Meritorious Service Medal.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.054
Their honesty
and devotion to duty

06:31.182 --> 06:32.764
make them examples
to every member

06:32.893 --> 06:34.555
of the New York
Police Department,

06:34.686 --> 06:36.177
as well as to every citizen.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.560
Captain Connor, at long last,

06:44.696 --> 06:46.483
the city has policemen
it can be proud of.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.364
You think sticking medals
in roundsmen

06:49.492 --> 06:51.358
with nary a hair
on their ball sack

06:51.494 --> 06:53.611
is gonna earn the respect
of the department?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.409
You want to give out medals,
Commissioner,

06:55.540 --> 06:58.704
I know men who are deserving.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.042
Sir.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.958
Commissioner?
A photograph, please?

07:10.639 --> 07:13.507
Captain Connor, please join us.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.653
Well done.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.241
My father loves to shoot,

07:40.377 --> 07:45.543
but we're never allowed to touch
a gun unless he's there.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.382
Can you shoot?

07:48.510 --> 07:51.048
My father taught me
when I was just about your age.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.219
Did your mother object?

07:56.351 --> 07:58.684
She died long before.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.349
Keep up the good work.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.144
They were friends,
my father and yours.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.517
Is that how
you got the job, then?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.565
I'd like to think not.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.284
Is that you, John?

08:19.416 --> 08:20.532
Morning, Gran.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.533
When you didn't come home
last night,

08:22.669 --> 08:23.876
I called your father, and...

08:24.004 --> 08:26.121
I should have let you know
my whereabouts.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.213
I'm sorry.

08:28.341 --> 08:32.551
You're irresponsible, John,
but you aren't cruel.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.544
Had you been drinking again?

08:34.681 --> 08:36.764
I'm merely seeing myself
through a rough patch.

08:36.890 --> 08:40.429
Oh?
You and your rough patches.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.138
You need to meet a nice girl.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.766
Marry her.
Have little Moores.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.644
I'm in a position
to introduce you

08:49.779 --> 08:51.020
to the right young lady.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.692
Oh!

08:52.824 --> 08:54.031
Loathsome machine.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.617
Quite a maze.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.456
And our killer
has to be found somewhere

09:02.584 --> 09:04.541
in the midst of it.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.501
Ancient cultures
believed fingerprints

09:06.629 --> 09:08.291
revealed the secrets
of the soul.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.335
Just like palmistry.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.756
As scientists, what does
it tell us, gentlemen?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.844
Nothing for now,
but if we find a second print,

09:15.972 --> 09:19.090
it may tell us whether
it belongs to the same man.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.342
What about this spot here?

09:22.604 --> 09:24.846
It's only a partial print.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.473
Some of the friction ridges
won't show up.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.108
Here.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.402
And over here.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.196
They could be cuts or abrasions.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.035
Belonging to a manual laborer,
perhaps.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.279
Or some skin disease.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.122
We need a clearer print
to do a proper analysis.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.617
What about the Santorelli boy?

09:47.921 --> 09:50.538
Could the killer have left
prints on his body or clothing?

09:50.673 --> 09:54.007
With the amount of blood
he shed, it's highly likely.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.005
We have his fingerprint.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.508
We know the kind of knife
he uses.

10:02.644 --> 10:05.011
I need you to go to the morgue
to check the body.

10:10.902 --> 10:14.020
♪ Oh, for the wings ♪

10:14.155 --> 10:18.069
♪ For the wings of a dove ♪

10:18.201 --> 10:20.818

10:35.051 --> 10:40.046

10:40.181 --> 10:42.138
You!
You were here this morning.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.304
- Out!
- That wasn't me!

10:45.436 --> 10:47.644
You know the rules!
Out!

11:04.122 --> 11:06.865
I do wish he had
stayed in Washington.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.866
His return to the city
has brought nothing

11:09.002 --> 11:11.540
but acrimony to its inhabitants.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.333
Who would that be, Mr. Tuthill?

11:13.464 --> 11:15.376
Roosevelt.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.874
Closing down the saloons
on Sunday.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.467
Who the hell
does he think he is?

11:18.595 --> 11:20.552
I'd call him a man
thirsty for reform.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.922
A bunch of hooey
is what I say.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.798
This won't take long,
Mr. Tuthill.

11:24.934 --> 11:28.223
Let me
see... Santorelli, Giorgio.

11:28.354 --> 11:32.018
Here we are.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.568
Now...

11:40.700 --> 11:43.192
Well, I'll be damned.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.891
The body
of the Santorelli child

11:46.915 --> 11:49.373
has been taken from the morgue.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.576
Dr. Kreizler, this is evidence

11:51.669 --> 11:53.752
of corruption within
the police department.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.997
Indeed.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.713
I've convinced
Commissioner Roosevelt

11:59.844 --> 12:02.052
that he now must trust you
more than his own men.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.388
The unwillingness
to pursue the killer

12:04.515 --> 12:06.507
on the part of the police
only highlights

12:06.643 --> 12:09.636
Mr. Roosevelt's isolation
within the department.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.499
They don't have the appetite
to approach matters

12:12.523 --> 12:14.606
from this new perspective
of yours...

12:14.734 --> 12:17.522
the "why"
rather than the "what."

12:17.654 --> 12:19.691
Every new thinker
is at first condemned

12:19.822 --> 12:22.030
by those for whom change
is far more terrifying

12:22.158 --> 12:23.990
than a murderer of children.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.460
We are quite alone
in searching for this killer.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.966
But I imagine that will
suit you well enough...

12:41.094 --> 12:42.710
to be quite alone.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.352
Your appearance would suggest
a social engagement.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.309
I have a Vassar reunion.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.200
Quite frankly, I'd prefer
to continue working

12:56.317 --> 12:57.524
on the Santorelli case.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.611
Because you require answers,

13:01.739 --> 13:04.106
or you wish
to keep the world at bay?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.157
Good night, Dr. Kreizler.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.925
Someone is the murderer,
and if you've been winked at,

13:23.052 --> 13:25.715
it means you've been killed
and you're out of the game.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.885
The object is
to catch the murderer

13:29.017 --> 13:30.599
before he winks at you.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.934
Are we all ready?

13:44.157 --> 13:47.650
Are we two the only old maids
in the entire class?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.574
Please, Miss Howard.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.368
Speak for yourself.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.583
Sara, meet Milton.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.961
Milton, Sara's my old
college roommate.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.125
Pleased to meet you.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.629
Sara works
for the police department.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.097
Oh.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.637
My uncle is a policeman
in Poughkeepsie.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.726
He says it's challenging work.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.686
Yes, I suppose it can be.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.300
You must wait by the punch bowl
when you're dead.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.697
I've been dying to tell you
I was engaged,

14:30.828 --> 14:34.242
but I was afraid
you wouldn't approve.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.701
Why should I not approve?

14:38.836 --> 14:40.623
If that's what you want.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.587
I only want
what any girl wants.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.051
And here's
something else.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.556
We've done it.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.435
Oh?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.894
You'll know what I'm talking
about one day.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.442
Oh, but I'm
being presumptuous.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.487
Perhaps you've got a beau.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.531
Well,

15:17.667 --> 15:21.377
there is someone,
but it's only just begun.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.712
Who is it?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.752
Somebody at
the police department?

15:25.883 --> 15:27.966
Oh, God, no.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.879
He's, um...

15:33.808 --> 15:35.845
He's a doctor.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.680
I used to play bridge
with your father.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.287
I regretted profiting
on his misplays, of course,

15:57.415 --> 15:59.907
but he insisted on wagering.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.704
He was a most proficient loser,
Mrs. Bell.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.748
There's no denying that.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.291
And how is your father?

16:05.423 --> 16:07.289
Oh, he's very well, thank you.

16:07.425 --> 16:10.168
We seldom speak,
my father and I.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.548
I wrote him a note

16:15.683 --> 16:17.094
when your poor brother
was drowned.

16:24.859 --> 16:28.318
I am terribly frightened
of the sea.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.812
It is so unpredictable.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.074
The water was innocent,
Madeline.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.695
It wasn't rough seas
so much as an unsteady sailor.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.822
It's Caroline.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.711
Laszlo!

17:34.720 --> 17:37.383
I remembered something.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.381
He never left the room
that night.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.662
Sally said they waited for her,
but when he didn't come out,

17:41.686 --> 17:43.552
they broke the lock
and found it empty!

17:44.939 --> 17:46.771
Who never left what room?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.606
Giorgio, the brothel.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.477
There was a window.
I saw it from across the street.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.423
It's too high to jump.
There was no fire escape.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.780
But Sally said that even though
Giorgio didn't have wings,

17:55.908 --> 17:56.944
he flew away.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.531
He also said
that Giorgio had a rich client

18:03.666 --> 18:05.453
who made a pet of him

18:05.585 --> 18:07.372
and was there
the night he was killed.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.416
And this client,

18:10.548 --> 18:11.914
did you discover a name?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.665
No.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.043
But he has a silver smile.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.921
A silver smile?

18:19.056 --> 18:20.763
A man who has
the power of flight,

18:20.891 --> 18:22.382
who can disappear at will.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.134
These incoherent ramblings,

18:24.270 --> 18:25.681
distractions that
show us nothing

18:25.813 --> 18:29.602
of the nature of the man, of...
of what he desires,

18:29.734 --> 18:32.317
of... of how he behaves.

18:35.156 --> 18:37.068
I must talk to the boy myself.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.711
That's him.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.884
Here! You!

19:02.016 --> 19:03.632
Boy!

19:04.518 --> 19:06.510
Come here!

19:06.646 --> 19:08.558
Oh, no, no.
You remember me.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.021
And I'm quite certain
you remember

19:10.149 --> 19:11.640
the contents of my billfold!

19:11.776 --> 19:13.517
Let go of me,
or I'll scream!

19:13.653 --> 19:16.361
Don't mind my friend. All we
want is to speak with you.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.746
I already
told your friend everything.

19:25.873 --> 19:26.873
Giorgio disappeared,

19:26.999 --> 19:28.226
and I didn't see him
with anyone.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.286
Either you're lying,

19:29.418 --> 19:31.058
or there was a hidden panel
in the room...

19:31.087 --> 19:32.874
the kind you boys use
to rob clients.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.192
You clients rob yourselves
when you walk through that door.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.709
Tell me, Sally, why do you work
out here on the streets tonight,

19:38.844 --> 19:40.380
not at Paresis Hall?

19:40.513 --> 19:42.616
In the brothel, we have
to pay most of what we earn

19:42.640 --> 19:43.881
to Kelly and Biff.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.552
In return for what?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.893
Protection from rough stuff.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.849
Do your clients
always expect you

19:50.981 --> 19:52.438
to dress as girls?

19:52.566 --> 19:55.149
We do things
real girls don't do.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.151
When you work out here,

20:00.282 --> 20:02.444
how do you know which ones
won't hurt you?

20:02.576 --> 20:04.763
When you've been working in this
business as long as I have,

20:04.787 --> 20:07.245
you know who to trust.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.876
Thank you, Sally.
You have been a great help.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.253
See you around.

20:22.972 --> 20:26.386
But we still don't know
how he vanished from that room.

20:26.517 --> 20:29.430
Forget for a moment
how he vanished, but why.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.519
Was he forced,
or did he go of his own accord?

20:31.647 --> 20:33.309
We've always assumed
he was killed,

20:33.441 --> 20:34.648
then left on the bridge.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.767
What if he was alive
when he arrived there?

20:36.902 --> 20:40.521
But why would he willingly go
to his death?

20:40.656 --> 20:43.615
Because he went with someone
he trusted.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.613
Thank you, Cyrus.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.822
- Night, sir.
- Please, sit down.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.010
There is nothing in these books
that gives me an insight

21:46.138 --> 21:48.676
into what it means
to take another life.

21:54.605 --> 21:59.396
Do you remember what I said
when I testified at your trial?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.152
Yes, sir, I do.
Every word.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.365
I told the jury that,
when you saw that woman beaten,

22:10.496 --> 22:11.953
it brought back the memories

22:12.081 --> 22:14.368
of how your own mother
was killed.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.584
That set off
an uncontrollable rage in you.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.579
I held the theory at the time.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.000
Did you not agree?

22:22.132 --> 22:23.714
I would agree to anything

22:23.843 --> 22:26.335
that would keep that rope
from 'round my neck.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.926
I mean,

22:35.062 --> 22:38.100
God created life,
but God also created murder.

22:38.232 --> 22:41.020
And if you're trying
to figure out a reason why,

22:41.151 --> 22:43.643
you're gonna
drive yourself mad.

22:54.832 --> 22:57.495
Is that all?

23:00.838 --> 23:02.374
Please, Doctor, don't.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.216
Tell me.

23:08.804 --> 23:12.047
You want to know what it
feels like to murder a man?

23:12.975 --> 23:15.058
'Cause I remember every moment.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.518
I remember the blood.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.012
I remember the broken teeth.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.355
I remember the feeling

23:20.482 --> 23:23.691
of that warm flesh of his neck
in my hand.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.105
Yeah.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.139
And you know something else,
Doctor,

23:28.240 --> 23:30.323
something I ain't
never told nobody?

23:32.286 --> 23:34.323
The thing I remember the most

23:34.455 --> 23:37.698
is the feeling of pleasure
that it gave me.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.170
There's blood on your shirt,
Doctor.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.508
It's ink.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.802
I'm afraid I've ruined it.

25:28.152 --> 25:29.268
Dr. Kreizler!

25:31.697 --> 25:33.063
There's been another one.

25:49.506 --> 25:52.465
Stevie, take that calash
around back.

25:53.177 --> 25:55.260
What is this place?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.379
It's the old
immigration station.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.597
They're turning it
into an aquarium.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.680
A roundsman from the precinct
has already been here.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.977
There's not
a lot of time.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.735
Where is the body?

26:26.668 --> 26:28.751
All the doors were locked.

26:28.879 --> 26:31.041
There's no way in or out.
I checked.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.836
And the locker here...
No keys are missing.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.111
I've already instructed

27:00.244 --> 27:01.429
the dispatcher at headquarters

27:01.453 --> 27:02.972
to hold back the information
for one hour.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.349
If you can hold it back
for one hour,

27:04.373 --> 27:06.160
you can hold it for three.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.125
Laszlo, I do not believe this
argument helps your cause...

27:09.253 --> 27:10.539
<i>our</i> cause.

27:10.671 --> 27:12.671
The commissioner has already
compromised himself...

27:36.697 --> 27:37.858
Captain! Sir!

27:37.990 --> 27:39.947
Roundsman Barclay,
can't you see I'm busy?

27:40.075 --> 27:41.816
Yes, sir.

27:41.952 --> 27:45.411
Mrs. Lamb's boardinghouse,
$18.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.202
- Sir...
- Holy mother of God, Barclay.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.167
You were not awarded a medal
for being irritating, were you?

27:51.295 --> 27:52.706
No, sir.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.500
I'm just wondering
why you're still here.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.213
Where should I be?

27:56.341 --> 27:58.221
There's a murder down
the Battery got called in.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.678
Who took it?

28:00.762 --> 28:02.253
Grady was on the desk.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.255
Who's gone and died now?

28:06.393 --> 28:07.679
It's another boy-whore.

28:13.358 --> 28:14.519
Why wasn't I told?

28:14.651 --> 28:16.108
Grady told the commissioner,

28:16.236 --> 28:19.354
and then the commissioner left
with them two sheeny detectives.

28:19.489 --> 28:20.689
- Raise the horses!
- Yes, sir.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.819
- Doyle, get the men.
- Yes, sir!

28:22.951 --> 28:23.951
Bloody hell!

28:26.872 --> 28:28.113
Come on!

28:38.592 --> 28:40.959
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

28:41.094 --> 28:42.094
- Doyle!
- Sir?

28:42.221 --> 28:44.213
- Summon Byrnes.
- He's already here, sir.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.305
Come on, men! Over here!
Come on!

28:46.433 --> 28:47.844
Men!
Let's see some movement!

28:55.609 --> 28:59.148
I see bad news travels fast.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.317
Why can't this fiend do his work
at a more reasonable hour?

29:02.449 --> 29:04.566
Let's go, let's go!

29:04.701 --> 29:07.239
Move it out!

29:20.801 --> 29:21.962
The man is appointed!

29:22.094 --> 29:24.051
As a favor.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.842
And now he acts as if he's
a 30-year veteran of the force!

29:26.974 --> 29:29.466
He'll be caught with his willy
in the ringer this time, Chief.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.513
Impeding a murder investigation,

29:31.645 --> 29:33.307
and a particularly
salacious one at that.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.646
I've tipped the boys off
already.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.561
Roosevelt...

29:37.693 --> 29:41.562
from stalwart reformer
to a torchbearer of corruption.

29:41.697 --> 29:44.189
The papers will eat that up
with a spoon.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.691
Can you tell us what's
going on up there, Commissioner?

29:46.827 --> 29:48.989
Word has it,
it's another boy's been killed.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.657
I'd like to know where

29:50.789 --> 29:52.906
you get your information from,
Mr. Steffens.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.361
You and your colleagues
seem to be

29:54.418 --> 29:55.895
one step ahead of the police
in the matter.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.160
So it's true, then?

29:57.296 --> 29:59.879
- Another boy? Another boy?
- Is it happening again, sir?

30:00.007 --> 30:03.000
Stevie! Get yourself
around front, boy.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.422
If you see the police,
you hightail inside.

30:05.554 --> 30:06.635
- You let me know!
- Okay!

30:06.763 --> 30:08.720
- Hightail it, boy!
- Okay!

30:14.563 --> 30:15.804
I can feel serrations

30:15.939 --> 30:18.647
on the zygomatic bone
around both eyes

30:18.775 --> 30:21.768
as well
as the supraorbital ridge.

30:24.281 --> 30:26.443
Identical to what we found
with the Zweig boy.

30:26.575 --> 30:29.033
Probably used the same knife
to take the eyes of both boys.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.527
The same hand at work.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.957
Careful where you step.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.227
I'm sorry
you had to see such a thing.

31:06.865 --> 31:10.529
I've seen death before,
but never like that.

31:17.084 --> 31:20.668
I fail to see a way
he might have gotten up here.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.795
Or down, for that matter.

31:25.675 --> 31:29.043
The Zweig children.
They were found in a water tank.

31:29.179 --> 31:31.091
Up on a roof.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.885
That's what Kreizler said.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.883
And Aaron Morton,
the paper stated his body

31:36.019 --> 31:38.011
was hidden
on the Brooklyn Bridge.

31:48.782 --> 31:51.365
Heights.
He's attracted to heights.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.156
A rooftop water tank,
two bridges, and now...

31:54.287 --> 31:56.870
Yes!
Yes, that's good.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.976
What else do the details
of the crime suggest to you?

32:01.753 --> 32:03.870
Might water play a role
as well?

32:04.005 --> 32:05.792
Yes.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.086
Water seems important.

32:08.218 --> 32:10.301
Perhaps a view of water.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.716
The Zweigs were hidden.
The Morton boy too.

32:12.848 --> 32:15.056
These last two, however,
were left in plain sight.

32:15.183 --> 32:16.515
He's no longer
hiding his victims.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.350
He's moved on, evolved.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.310
Evolved to what?

32:25.318 --> 32:26.479
Have you determined

32:26.611 --> 32:28.171
what might have been
the cause of death?

32:28.280 --> 32:30.133
There is bruising
to the neck, front and back,

32:30.157 --> 32:32.774
which indicates strangulation.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.445
I see no defensive wounds.

32:34.578 --> 32:36.418
You're not suggesting
he didn't put up a fight.

32:36.538 --> 32:37.538
Maybe not.

32:37.539 --> 32:38.825
I come here willingly

32:38.957 --> 32:40.994
with someone
I believe I can trust.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.086
And even as I'm being strangled,
I don't struggle,

32:43.170 --> 32:46.208
because asphyxiation is
an expected part of the act.

32:46.339 --> 32:47.796
What kind of act?

32:47.924 --> 32:49.540
A sexual act.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.463
Look here.
A fingermark.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.489
Do you think it can be
captured with a photograph?

32:53.513 --> 32:55.846
I'm afraid we're unable
to reproduce something so small,

32:55.974 --> 32:57.715
Dr. Kreizler,
not without sufficient light.

32:57.851 --> 32:59.012
But we must try.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.557
That fingerprint
could prove invaluable.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.784
Watch out!
Out of my way!

33:22.459 --> 33:24.939
Do you see a pattern developing
with the number of boys killed?

33:29.508 --> 33:31.215
Excuse me, gentlemen.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.343
Sir!

33:40.977 --> 33:42.218
Okay, lads!
Everybody out!

33:42.354 --> 33:44.437
Line up and look sharp!

33:44.564 --> 33:45.356
Come on!

33:45.357 --> 33:47.815
Move your bloody asses!

33:47.943 --> 33:50.185
Now, lads.
File up!

33:56.993 --> 33:59.201
The police!
They're here!

33:59.329 --> 34:01.321
- One more.
- We need more light.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.072
If we could only wait
for daylight.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.200
Laszlo, we must go.
We have to go now.

34:05.335 --> 34:06.604
Roosevelt will
be held accountable

34:06.628 --> 34:07.664
if you're found here!

34:07.796 --> 34:10.379
Laszlo, please.
Come on.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.944
- Sergeant.
- Commissioner.

34:40.036 --> 34:42.870
Captain Connor, good thing
you've finally arrived.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.659
Why wasn't I informed
about this?

34:44.791 --> 34:47.033
The investigation
is well in hand, Captain.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.376
The Isaacsons
are already present.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.541
Your men are to assist them
in every possible way.

35:08.982 --> 35:11.440
Young Commissioner Roosevelt.

35:11.568 --> 35:12.649
Are you well?

35:14.487 --> 35:16.399
For a man
who is retired, Chief,

35:16.531 --> 35:18.318
we're certainly seeing
a lot of you.

35:18.450 --> 35:22.660
Once a servant of the people,
always a servant of the people.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.288
We need to secure
these premises, Commissioner.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.376
Of course, Captain.

35:31.504 --> 35:32.961
Do your duty.

35:34.758 --> 35:37.216
Okay, you heard the captain.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.483
It's about time!

36:00.950 --> 36:04.114
Come on! Come on, you!
Come on!

36:10.669 --> 36:11.876
The forensic science

36:12.003 --> 36:13.835
is no use to us
without more time.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.330
You must
make Roosevelt understa...

36:20.428 --> 36:21.544
What are you doing here?

36:24.724 --> 36:26.841
I gave no such instruction
for you to come here.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.763
Have Cyrus take you.

36:41.825 --> 36:43.282
Thank you, Mary.

36:47.997 --> 36:50.239
We've been up all night,
Laszlo.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.786
I would prefer
the opportunity

36:51.918 --> 36:54.035
to sleep
and collect my thoughts.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.273
While the impression is fresh,
we must take advantage.

36:56.297 --> 36:59.290
I assure you,
the impression of a poor boy

36:59.426 --> 37:01.338
slaughtered like an animal
will remain fresh,

37:01.469 --> 37:02.710
if not indelible.

37:02.846 --> 37:06.510
Yes.
It is slaughter.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.633
They have been led
to slaughter.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.678
Those last few moments
must have been terrorizing.

37:12.814 --> 37:15.272
Is the child's terror essential
to the killer's experience?

37:15.400 --> 37:16.516
Laszlo, please.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.563
Only on the assumption
that there's some meaning

37:18.695 --> 37:19.936
- to his actions.
- Yes.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.298
Certainly,
a beggar is motivated

37:21.322 --> 37:23.050
to steal a piece of bread
because he's hungry.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.690
But why does our killer do
what he does?

37:24.826 --> 37:27.443
We all must be held accountable,
regardless of our misfortunes.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.320
I'm not speaking about
accountability.

37:29.456 --> 37:32.574
I'm speaking about empathy,
about understanding.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.666
Understanding?

37:34.794 --> 37:37.878
The man murders children
for pleasure.

37:45.138 --> 37:47.058
This might help you
to put yourself in his place.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.259
The very notion
fills me with loathing.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.477
I am quite sure a book
will not change my mind.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.313
Then ask yourself why you seek
the companionship of strangers.

37:58.318 --> 38:01.732
'Cause you enjoy it?
Or are you salving a wound?

38:01.863 --> 38:04.105
Your broken engagement,
your father's disapproval,

38:04.240 --> 38:05.401
your brother's death.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.492
Whatever I'm doing,
I'm not butchering children!

38:11.915 --> 38:13.372
This fixation on boys.

38:14.334 --> 38:19.045
Perhaps he's reliving
a physical or emotional trauma.

38:21.216 --> 38:22.878
Miss Howard,

38:23.009 --> 38:24.966
how did you cope
with your father's suicide?

38:25.094 --> 38:28.428
Sara, that does not require
a response.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.724
John indulges himself
with drink.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.059
What do you do?

38:34.187 --> 38:35.473
Kreizler, that's quite enough!

38:35.605 --> 38:37.249
Miss Howard, if she wants
to be of aid here,

38:37.273 --> 38:39.593
must confront her feelings,
because we all, in some manner,

38:39.651 --> 38:42.143
protect ourselves from
psychological and emotional pain

38:42.278 --> 38:45.021
by taking action
to craft fantasies of revenge,

38:45.156 --> 38:47.614
of power,
of sexual gratification.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.324
So, what is it, Miss Howard?

38:49.452 --> 38:51.694
What is your opiate?

38:51.830 --> 38:53.867
This is insufferable.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.490
Come on, Sara.
We don't have to listen to this.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.708
Go on, then.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.841
Both of you.

39:06.803 --> 39:09.762
And come back when you're able
to look inside yourselves.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.910
Damn superiority.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.707
We're not free
to ask questions,

39:42.839 --> 39:46.674
but he's free to go mucking
around in our personal lives.

39:49.554 --> 39:53.514
He asked about your father.
I simply told him the truth.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.640
It was very personal,
wasn't it?

39:58.771 --> 40:01.013
Yeah.

40:01.149 --> 40:04.313
But I'm afraid what he said
might be right.

40:04.444 --> 40:07.983
Even if it is, it... it does
not excuse his impertinence.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.695
Tell me about Mary.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.194
That was more than
reprimanding a servant.

40:15.330 --> 40:18.323
Oh. Mary.

40:19.667 --> 40:23.456
She was taken in by Kreizler
when she was still quite young.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.580
Dare I ask why?

40:27.258 --> 40:29.375
She burned
her father to death.

40:30.345 --> 40:32.052
You're not serious.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.638
On the contrary.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.975
It took her several attempts
to set him alight.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.352
He wants to shield her
from this,

40:48.488 --> 40:50.730
but it was more than that.

40:50.865 --> 40:54.484
He was embarrassed to show
his concern in front of us.

40:54.619 --> 40:57.407
It caused him
to become angry.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.029
My God.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.452
You're beginning to sound
just like him.

41:01.584 --> 41:03.917
Am I?

41:04.045 --> 41:06.458
I'm afraid
the both of us are.

41:07.840 --> 41:11.083
You can be quite amusing
when you want to be, John Moore.
