00:14.082 --> 00:17.194
- Max, stop it!
- Max, stop it!

00:17.218 --> 00:19.763
Let's race. - No!

00:19.787 --> 00:22.399
- You don't wanna race 'cause
you know you won't win! Loser.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.558
- Because you cheat!

00:34.135 --> 00:36.637
- Hey, Eric. Come here.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.319
- That's Brandy, the
Steelbacks' dog.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.854
- Brandy! Brandy!
Come here, girl!

00:44.878 --> 00:47.624
- What are you doing?
- Come here, Brandy.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.394
- Hi, puppy! Hi!

00:50.418 --> 00:53.697
What are you doing out here
all by yourself, girl?

00:53.721 --> 00:56.633
What are you doing? Awww!

00:56.657 --> 00:59.703
Hi, puppy. Hi! Hi!

00:59.727 --> 01:03.307
Awww.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.842
Max, what are you doing?!
- Come here, you stupid mutt!

01:05.866 --> 01:09.579
- Don't hurt her! Max, stop it!

01:09.603 --> 01:12.206
- Come on, Brandy! Move.

01:15.443 --> 01:18.855
- No, don't hurt her!

01:18.879 --> 01:21.258
- Boys!
- Get off me!

01:21.282 --> 01:24.194
- Shut up! I'm gonna beat
you so bad that even Mom

01:24.218 --> 01:27.497
won't recognize you!
- Boys! Max, you stop it!

01:27.521 --> 01:31.168
- He started it!
- Hun, you OK?

01:31.192 --> 01:33.903
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

01:33.927 --> 01:36.406
- Yeah. I'm OK, Mrs. Nolan.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.575
- You need to tell

01:38.599 --> 01:40.677
your mother that he treats
you like that, sweetie.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.413
Brothers are supposed to
be good to one another.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.183
- He's my half-brother.
- Still!

01:46.207 --> 01:48.585
He shouldn't be
allowed to bully you.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.620
OK?

01:50.644 --> 01:52.689
- Eric tried to start
a fight with me.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.292
- That's not true. He tried
to hurt the Steelbacks' dog.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.561
- Eric! What have
I told you about

01:57.585 --> 02:00.330
fighting with your brother?
- He started it!

02:00.354 --> 02:01.799
- And he told Mrs.
Nolan all kinds of

02:01.811 --> 02:03.267
bad stuff about me.
- No, I didn't!

02:03.291 --> 02:05.635
- Great, Eric! Now I'm gonna
have to deal with that bitch

02:05.659 --> 02:08.437
griping about what a bad mom I am.
Is that what you want?

02:08.461 --> 02:11.241
- I never said anything.
- You know,

02:11.265 --> 02:13.665
if you want to go swimming, you
better put your swimsuits on.

02:26.614 --> 02:29.617
- Stop it, asshat.

02:35.223 --> 02:38.468
- Briana. Briana. Hi.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.371
Yeah. Hi. - Hey.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.473
Barbara.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.709
- I just wanted to let you
know about something...

02:45.733 --> 02:47.811
- Yeah, yeah. Hold on a second.
Boys!

02:47.835 --> 02:50.314
Go sit on the side of the
pool until I'm done here.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.649
- Yeah, no,

02:52.673 --> 02:55.852
I came out to water my
plants, and I saw Max

02:55.876 --> 02:59.513
straddling Eric and just...
punching him in the face.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.694
- Just boys being boys.
Roughhousing.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.630
- Yeah, no, not really.
See, I raised three boys,

03:06.654 --> 03:08.665
and I know roughhousing.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.891
This was much more serious.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.954
- Max, Mom said we were supposed
to stay on the side of the pool.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.612
- Boys! Get out of the pool!

03:22.636 --> 03:25.415
God. Uh, listen, Barbara,
I appreciate you

03:25.439 --> 03:26.816
coming over and talking to
me about this and I'll talk

03:26.840 --> 03:28.785
to them about it later, 'kay?
Have a good day.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.820
- No, look. You know, if
you ever feel overwhelmed,

03:30.844 --> 03:33.323
or just need a break, call me.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.325
I'd be happy to
come over and sit.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.761
- Yeah, you've told me that
before, I think. I appreciate it.

03:37.785 --> 03:41.365
Have a good rest of your day.
Yeah.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.967
- OK. Bye.

03:43.991 --> 03:47.795
Mind your own business,
you old bat.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.470
- Eric, watch how it's done.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.795
- You boys playing nice?

04:29.737 --> 04:31.915
- We're diving for pennies.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.308
- OK. Great.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.476
- Oh, God, baby, please don't
die, please don't die!

04:59.500 --> 05:01.911
Is he gonna die? - Clear!

05:01.935 --> 05:04.481
- Oh, God!

05:04.505 --> 05:07.984
Baby, please don't die!

05:08.008 --> 05:10.119
- Let's take him
to the ambulance.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.747
- Is he gonna be OK?

05:35.769 --> 05:38.415
Eric?

05:38.439 --> 05:40.641
Come over here. Now.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.787
Pay your respects
to your brother.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.101
Tell him you miss him.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.928
- I miss you.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.400
- Tell him what's been
going on in your life.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.015
- I've been going to the
park, and swimming.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.518
Oh,

06:14.542 --> 06:17.621
and I also played with
the Steelbacks' dog.

06:17.645 --> 06:20.590
Mr. Steelback was
walking her last night.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.593
- We miss you very much.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.620
The house feels
empty without you.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.937
Say goodbye to your brother!

06:47.207 --> 06:49.777
- Bye.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.693
- OK, here it comes.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.862
Oh! You OK? - Yeah.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.021
- I hit your shin. You
gotta be ready for it!

07:03.557 --> 07:06.102
You're supposed to catch
it, not run away from it!

07:06.126 --> 07:08.462
Yeah! Good job!

07:14.001 --> 07:16.780
Oh.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.782
Good job, princess!

07:18.806 --> 07:21.050
OK. Good job!

07:21.074 --> 07:23.477
Gotta keep your eye on the ball.
- OK, Dad.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.619
- Thanks!

07:34.722 --> 07:36.800
Ah!

07:36.824 --> 07:39.503
- Hey!

07:39.527 --> 07:42.530
Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm OK.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.835
- Who are you here with?
- I'm by myself.

07:55.175 --> 07:58.254
- You wanna try a few?
- Sure!

07:58.278 --> 08:00.990
- OK. Alright! I think
I got an extra mitt

08:01.014 --> 08:03.584
around here somewhere.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.689
- Hi!
- Hi!

08:25.105 --> 08:27.150
- Nice!

08:27.174 --> 08:31.054
OK. We're gonna call it a day.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.222
Kaylee, honey,

08:33.246 --> 08:35.182
we're gonna go soon. - OK, Dad.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.294
- Why do we have to stop?
- Well,

08:39.318 --> 08:41.664
we're gonna barbecue tonight.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.000
I still gotta stop by the
store on the way home.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.803
- Oh.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.772
- What did you say
your name was, again?

08:48.796 --> 08:51.941
- Eric.
- Well, Eric,

08:51.965 --> 08:54.077
won't you have to get
home for dinner too?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.979
Your mom and dad are gonna
wonder where you are.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.081
- I don't have a dad.

08:58.105 --> 09:01.041
He left right after I was born.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.188
- Oh, I see.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.223
You live with your mom?

09:07.247 --> 09:09.959
- I used to live
with my brother too,

09:09.983 --> 09:12.152
and then he drowned in our pool.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.333
- Oh, boy. That's terrible.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.727
I think I remember
seeing that in the news.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.107
Bet that's really hard
on you and your mom.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.667
- Not really.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.352
- You know what, Eric?
Kaylee and I,

09:36.376 --> 09:38.416
we're gonna be out here again
on Saturday afternoon.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.026
If you'd like to practice
with us, all you have to do

09:43.050 --> 09:44.994
is show up. How's that sound?

09:45.018 --> 09:47.764
- OK!
- 'Kay.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.667
Kaylee, honey?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.736
Come on, help me clean up.
- OK, Dad.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.671
- I'll help her.
- Thanks.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.741
Everything goes in the bag.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.709
- Do you have any
brothers or sisters?

09:59.733 --> 10:02.178
- No.
- So where do you guys live?

10:02.202 --> 10:04.104
- On Marigold street.
- Where's that?

10:06.874 --> 10:10.987
Um, so is it far away?
- No. Sometimes we walk here.

10:11.011 --> 10:14.691
- What's your address?
- I dunno. Why?

10:14.715 --> 10:16.893
- Well, maybe I could
come over and play!

10:16.917 --> 10:19.162
I could bring my remote control
cars, and we could race them.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.898
- That'd be fun!
- So how do I know

10:21.922 --> 10:25.068
which house is yours?
- There's stones at the bottom,

10:25.092 --> 10:26.927
a gray door, and
two red flowers.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.931
- Kaylee!

10:49.182 --> 10:51.360
- Awww!
- Hello there!

10:51.384 --> 10:54.397
- Awww!

10:54.421 --> 10:57.734
He's so friendly! - That's Duke.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.804
What are you doing out
here all by yourself?

11:00.828 --> 11:03.172
- Nothing.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.098
- Is something wrong
with your bike?

11:07.434 --> 11:11.080
- Uh, no. I was just
about to go home.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.850
My dad's barbecuing.
- Mmm, sounds yummy.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.985
Can we come? - No,

11:16.009 --> 11:18.421
but I could skip the barbecue
and come to your house.

11:18.445 --> 11:22.926
- You're so cute. But Duke and
I already have dinner plans.

11:22.950 --> 11:26.153
Maybe next time! Enjoy
your barbecue, honey.

11:28.288 --> 11:31.291
- Bye, Duke!

11:35.162 --> 11:38.007
- Hey! Hey!

11:38.031 --> 11:39.900
You forgot your phone.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.537
- Mom?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.463
- Leave me alone.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.268
- Are we gonna eat dinner?

12:23.510 --> 12:26.213
- Did you take your
brother's bike to the park?

12:30.050 --> 12:32.161
- Yes.

12:32.185 --> 12:35.331
- Don't you ever, ever

12:35.355 --> 12:38.267
touch his things, do
you understand me?

12:38.291 --> 12:41.037
- He can't use them any...

12:41.061 --> 12:44.131
- THEY'RE HIS THINGS!
Understand?

13:24.237 --> 13:26.515
- Hi, Eric. Is your mom here?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.584
- She's sleeping.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.020
- Well, have you had supper yet?
- No.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.922
- Well, I made you some taco...
- We want it!

13:32.946 --> 13:35.048
- Oh, good.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.899
Here.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.401
Now, where does your
mom keep the forks?

13:45.425 --> 13:49.897
- Uhh, in that drawer.
- Here?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.879
- What are you
doing in my house?

13:55.903 --> 13:58.414
- Oh, I was just...
- I want you out.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.449
- Briana,

14:00.473 --> 14:02.919
calm down. I made dinner for...

14:02.943 --> 14:05.221
- You always meddle in
everyone's business!

14:05.245 --> 14:08.124
- What?
- You were so worried

14:08.148 --> 14:12.061
about how Eric was being
mistreated by Max, and now look!

14:12.085 --> 14:15.255
Look what happened!

14:19.326 --> 14:22.505
My son would still be alive
if it weren't for you.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.909
- What?! What are
you talking about?

14:25.933 --> 14:28.111
The boys were both
fine when I left.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.446
- It's true, Mom, we were.
- ERIC!

14:30.470 --> 14:34.550
The adults are talking.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.619
You distracted me.

14:36.643 --> 14:40.489
If I hadn't been so rattled
by you complaining about Max,

14:40.513 --> 14:42.625
I would have been watching,

14:42.649 --> 14:45.228
and I would have
seen him go under!

14:45.252 --> 14:48.431
- Hey, now. Look. Be reasonable.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.700
Max's death was an accident.
It was nobody's fault.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.527
- It's your fault!

14:56.663 --> 14:59.075
It should have been you.

14:59.099 --> 15:03.546
- Oh my God. How can you
say such a terrible thing?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.282
- Oh. You're so worried

15:06.306 --> 15:09.986
about Eric.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.687
And what, now you're worried
that he's not getting enough of

15:11.711 --> 15:13.546
whatever this crap is?

15:16.583 --> 15:20.163
You should just
take him with you.

15:20.187 --> 15:23.366
- That might not be
such a bad idea.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.392
I can tell you've been drinking.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.306
- That's what you
wanted, isn't it?

15:30.330 --> 15:32.508
That's what you've
wanted all along.

15:32.532 --> 15:36.012
- Of course not. Look, I...
I don't think you know

15:36.036 --> 15:38.047
what you're saying right now.
- I let you take

15:38.071 --> 15:40.473
one of my sons away. I'm not
gonna let you take another.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.520
- Eric, honey?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.589
I think your mom needs
some time alone.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.757
Would you like to come spend
the night at my house?

15:48.781 --> 15:51.594
- He's staying right here.

15:51.618 --> 15:55.331
- I can go with her if...
- ERIC! QUIET.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.433
- Look. Briana, really.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.735
Don't you think it's better
for everybody if he just

15:59.759 --> 16:02.438
comes over to my house. It's
right across the street.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.174
You can pick him up later.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.176
- I don't need to get him later,

16:07.200 --> 16:09.236
'cause he's not going anywhere.

16:12.272 --> 16:16.019
- Look. He can either come
with me now, to my house,

16:16.043 --> 16:17.786
for the night, or I'm calling the
police the minute I walk out

- Well, Eric, I'm the
new baseball coach

22:54.173 --> 22:56.543

love to have you on the team.

have a real talent.

cars anymore?

Well,

24:11.918 --> 24:15.230
- How is that good?

24:15.254 --> 24:18.967
- Because, if someone steals her
purse and uses her credit cards

24:18.991 --> 24:21.036
or ATM cards, the cops
are gonna think that

24:21.060 --> 24:23.460

her, and they won't suspect us.

you were mean to me, and Mom
always liked you the best.

25:18.918 --> 25:22.755
- So, what's she gonna say when
she finds out you let me die?

25:24.957 --> 25:27.703

she'll never know.

25:27.727 --> 25:31.640

Right. And be loose.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.387
No! You're not going
to go to jail.

You could hurt yourself.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.439
She liked him the best,

36:37.463 --> 36:41.543
but now he's gone, so,
it's just me and her.

36:41.567 --> 36:44.779
- I'm sorry to hear that.

36:44.803 --> 36:47.815
Sometimes it can take
people a long time

36:47.839 --> 36:50.885
to move through the sadness
they feel after someone dies.

36:50.909 --> 36:54.256
- I know.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.990
I get really sad
when people die too,

36:56.014 --> 36:58.826
just not when Max died.

36:58.850 --> 37:02.264
- You know somebody
else who died?

37:02.288 --> 37:05.032
Who?

37:05.056 --> 37:09.337
- I dunno.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.373
What do you want?

37:11.397 --> 37:13.308
- Uh, chili cheese fries
and an ice cream.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.643
- And an ice cream?! Mm,

37:15.667 --> 37:19.547
what about, a corn dog
and chili cheese fries.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.940
- OK.
- OK.

37:28.079 --> 37:32.026
- There she is. Beauty.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.061
She's got everything
you need to live.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.931
You can go off the
grid in style.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.334
- You can just park this,

37:39.358 --> 37:41.469
like, off-road? Like, in
the middle of the woods?

37:41.493 --> 37:43.938
- Sure. Middle of the
woods, on a beach...

37:43.962 --> 37:46.508
That's where we should go.

37:46.532 --> 37:49.577
Mexico.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.980
Playa del Carmen.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.049
- Can this thing even
make it to Mexico?

37:55.073 --> 37:57.652
- Please, woman.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.811
This has seen more of the
countryside than you have.

38:05.551 --> 38:07.462
- So, you gonna
offer me a drink?

38:07.486 --> 38:10.422
- You want a drink?

38:23.535 --> 38:26.381
- He talked to me a
little about his brother.

38:26.405 --> 38:29.351
I was surprised.
- What did he say?

38:29.375 --> 38:31.686
- Just that he didn't miss him.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.755
I mean, I guess his brother
was sort of mean to him.

38:33.779 --> 38:36.090
He didn't elaborate.

38:36.114 --> 38:38.926
But he did say that Max was
his mother's favourite.

38:38.950 --> 38:42.754
- That... is just...
heartbreaking.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.934
- I also get the
sense this isn't

38:46.958 --> 38:49.070
his first time
dealing with death.

38:49.094 --> 38:52.774
- I don't think his mom's in
any shape to take care of him.

38:52.798 --> 38:54.733
You saw her.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.662
- This is the area where
police have located the car

39:14.686 --> 39:16.864
belonging to Barbara
Nolan, the Carson Heights

39:16.888 --> 39:19.100
grandmother of two who went
missing two weeks ago.

39:19.124 --> 39:22.103
Police are still waiting for
identification of the body

39:22.127 --> 39:24.472
believed to be that of the
55 year old accountant,

39:24.496 --> 39:26.674
found a few miles
from Kern Campground.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.910
Our source at the department
says we can expect

39:28.934 --> 39:31.437
to receive that confirmation
by tomorrow night.

39:37.643 --> 39:38.986
- I can't believe you
guys are hungry.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.713
You just spent the entire
day eating junk food!

39:43.715 --> 39:46.084
Let's come up to bed.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.856
- Goodnight, sweetie.
- Goodnight.

39:54.660 --> 39:58.840
- Did you have fun today?
- Best day ever.

39:58.864 --> 40:01.166
Can I stay the night?

40:03.502 --> 40:05.547
- You wanna sleep here?

40:05.571 --> 40:07.749
Uh... Buddy,

40:07.773 --> 40:10.017
I told your mom I was gonna
have you home by nine.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.478
- She won't care.

40:15.947 --> 40:18.693
- I tell you what. When I
take you home, we'll ask her.

40:18.717 --> 40:21.953
And if she says yes, we'll make
plans for a sleepover. OK?

40:35.601 --> 40:37.435
- Can we just go
back to your place?

40:44.610 --> 40:46.545
- Eric?

40:48.647 --> 40:51.526
Is there something

40:51.550 --> 40:53.819
you wanna tell me?

40:56.888 --> 40:58.824
Is there a...

41:01.727 --> 41:04.205
a good reason

41:04.229 --> 41:07.733
that you don't like being home?

41:16.775 --> 41:18.777
- No.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.624
- Heyyy!

41:56.648 --> 41:58.617
Hey!

42:05.056 --> 42:07.125
Did you have fun at the arcade?

42:11.196 --> 42:13.064
Did you tell anyone our secret?

42:16.267 --> 42:18.203
Good boy.

42:20.739 --> 42:24.209
They found Mrs. Nolan's
car this morning.

42:27.012 --> 42:29.691
We wanted it to get stolen.
'Cause if it was stolen,

42:29.715 --> 42:33.695
someone else's fingerprints
would be in it.

42:33.719 --> 42:37.632
It's OK. As long as you
kept on your gloves,

42:37.656 --> 42:39.991
no one will ever know
you were in that car.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.907
I wanted her body to be
dragged away and eaten

42:45.931 --> 42:49.110
by some wild animal, but with
my luck, that didn't happen.

42:49.134 --> 42:52.246
It's OK.

42:52.270 --> 42:54.315
Mommy's got a plan to take us

42:54.339 --> 42:56.818
far, far away from here.

42:56.842 --> 42:59.987
- You mean we're moving?

43:00.011 --> 43:02.657
I don't wanna move!

43:02.681 --> 43:04.992
- Don't worry! I have
everything handled.

43:05.016 --> 43:07.261
- I'M NOT MOVING!

43:07.285 --> 43:09.396
- Eric.

43:09.420 --> 43:12.667
- I'M STAYING HERE
AND THAT'S FINAL!

43:12.691 --> 43:15.293
- No, you're not!

43:18.096 --> 43:20.598
- I'M NOT MOVING!

43:38.083 --> 43:40.719
- Listen. Eric.

43:43.689 --> 43:47.168
I was talking to the police today.
They're getting really

43:47.192 --> 43:49.704
close to figuring out that
you and I killed Mrs. Nolan.

43:49.728 --> 43:51.830
- You killed her, not me.

43:54.132 --> 43:56.978
- Well, you and I both drove
her to that campground, now,

43:57.002 --> 43:59.280
didn't we? And I
wouldn't have had to do

43:59.304 --> 44:01.315
anything if you didn't
invite her over.

44:01.339 --> 44:04.910
She wanted to take you away,
do you remember that?

44:08.013 --> 44:10.124
Do you want the
police to come here,

44:10.148 --> 44:12.117
take you away and
put you in jail?

44:14.786 --> 44:17.699
- I don't care anymore.

44:17.723 --> 44:19.390
Yeah, you do.

44:22.894 --> 44:24.839
Look, when I said
we were going away,

44:24.863 --> 44:27.341
I meant on a vacation, OK?

44:27.365 --> 44:29.877
For like a week, that's it.

44:29.901 --> 44:32.337
To somewhere really cool.

44:34.472 --> 44:37.318
- Where?
- Well, I can't tell you

44:37.342 --> 44:40.087
because it's a surprise.
But I can tell you

44:40.111 --> 44:44.115
that there's lots of pools,
and there's a theme park...

44:46.317 --> 44:48.295
and a life-size mouse.

44:48.319 --> 44:50.832
- Disney World.
- Yes!

44:50.856 --> 44:53.067
Aren't you happy? You
always want to go there.

44:53.091 --> 44:55.737
- You say that we're
gonna go all the time,

44:55.761 --> 44:59.097
and then we never do.
- Well, this time I mean it.

45:01.132 --> 45:03.745
OK?

45:03.769 --> 45:06.213
Mmmmmwah. Goodnight.

45:06.237 --> 45:08.774
Sleep tight. Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

45:16.915 --> 45:19.350
- She can go by herself.

45:31.029 --> 45:33.274
- Knock, knock.

45:33.298 --> 45:36.277
Got a minute?
- Yeah, come on in.

45:36.301 --> 45:39.881
- Sorry to interrupt.
I got a question

45:39.905 --> 45:41.849
to ask you about new
recess equipment.

45:41.873 --> 45:45.252
- Oh, no. I was just, uh...

45:45.276 --> 45:47.154
Just trying to find out a
little more information

45:47.178 --> 45:49.256
on Eric Wilson's brother.

45:49.280 --> 45:52.059
Terrible, what happened.

45:52.083 --> 45:55.096
- It is. I'm assuming
you've met their mother.

45:55.120 --> 45:57.164
Oh yes.

45:57.188 --> 45:59.133
- Sounds like she's not
your favourite parent.

45:59.157 --> 46:01.335
- Briana? Hardly.

46:01.359 --> 46:04.138
Max, the one who drowned,

46:04.162 --> 46:06.240
he was in trouble quite a bit.

46:06.264 --> 46:10.077
He'd get sent down to my
office at least once a month.

46:10.101 --> 46:13.280
I'd call her, and she'd
be two hours late

46:13.304 --> 46:15.950
picking him up.

46:15.974 --> 46:17.985
Then she'd tell me I didn't
know how to do my job,

46:18.009 --> 46:20.454
and defend him no
matter what he did.

46:20.478 --> 46:24.291
Etcetera, etcetera.
Always combative.

46:24.315 --> 46:27.995
- What do you know about Eric?
- I didn't really know Eric,

46:28.019 --> 46:31.398
because he rarely
got into trouble.

46:31.422 --> 46:35.369
The teachers always said
he was sweet and quiet.

46:35.393 --> 46:38.339
Smart, but reserved.

46:38.363 --> 46:41.943
- Do you have any idea what
Briana does for a living?

46:41.967 --> 46:44.011
- I'm pretty sure she's
living off a settlement

46:44.035 --> 46:46.981
she received a while back
for a slip or something

46:47.005 --> 46:49.283
in a grocery store.
As far as I know,

46:49.307 --> 46:51.418
she doesn't have a job.
Why do you ask?

46:51.442 --> 46:54.255
- I get a very weird
vibe off her.

46:54.279 --> 46:56.590
- I'm not surprised.

46:56.614 --> 46:58.884
The woman is a little off.

47:08.359 --> 47:12.239
- Hey, buddy!

47:12.263 --> 47:14.108
You know there's no
practice today, right?

47:14.132 --> 47:17.211
- I know.

47:17.235 --> 47:20.214
- Is your mom coming
to pick you up?

47:20.238 --> 47:23.951
- She never picks me up. I
was gonna ride my bike home,

47:23.975 --> 47:26.444
but I forgot my helmet again.

47:30.015 --> 47:33.218
- Alright. Come on,
I'll give you a lift.

47:37.288 --> 47:39.569
- Can we do that sleepover we
talked about tomorrow night?

47:43.228 --> 47:46.407
- Ah, I dunno, pal.

47:46.431 --> 47:49.200
- You promised.

47:53.204 --> 47:56.383
- OK. I tell you what.
We'll ask your mom.

47:56.407 --> 47:58.876
If she says yes, you got a deal.

48:03.114 --> 48:06.427
- Mom, can I go to the coach's
house tomorrow for a sleepover?

48:06.451 --> 48:09.430
- Who's all going, just you?

48:09.454 --> 48:12.699
- No, everyone else on the team.

48:12.723 --> 48:15.002
Everyone's parents

48:15.026 --> 48:16.946
are letting them go, might
seem weird if I can't.

48:19.730 --> 48:21.690
- Fine. Whatever. Go. I
could use some alone time.

48:25.603 --> 48:29.383
- She said yes!

48:29.407 --> 48:31.385
- Oh! OK, great! Well, let
me give her my address.

48:31.409 --> 48:33.587
- Oh, no, I know where you live.
I can just ride

48:33.611 --> 48:35.656
my bike there. It's by the park.
- Hey, Eric!

48:35.680 --> 48:38.259
She needs to know my address
so she knows where you are.

48:38.283 --> 48:40.694
- OK. I will.
- And don't forget to wear

48:40.718 --> 48:43.088
your helmet! - OK, bye!

48:54.632 --> 48:57.511
So you think

48:57.535 --> 49:01.039
your bears are gonna have fun in the
tent tonight? - Yes, we love camping!

49:07.012 --> 49:09.490
- So if you hang that up,
the bears can't get it?

49:09.514 --> 49:12.559
- Exactly. That's why
they call it a bear bag.

49:12.583 --> 49:15.129
- But what if
Kaylee's teddy bears

49:15.153 --> 49:17.298
get hungry in the
middle of the night?

49:17.322 --> 49:20.567
- Then they can come into
the house and wake us up,

49:20.591 --> 49:23.228
and we'll get it down for them.

49:26.464 --> 49:29.443
- Nice sign, Eric.

49:29.467 --> 49:32.779
- Thanks. Maybe we could hang
it on that tree over there.

49:32.803 --> 49:36.617
- Yeah.

49:36.641 --> 49:38.585
I thought you said you'd
never been camping before.

49:38.609 --> 49:40.587
- I haven't.

49:40.611 --> 49:43.281
- Then how do you know
about Kern Campground?

49:48.486 --> 49:50.531
Is it a secret?

49:50.555 --> 49:52.666
You know, honey,

49:52.690 --> 49:55.126
sometimes keeping secrets can
make us feel achy inside.

49:57.595 --> 50:00.331
If you have a secret like that,
it's good to tell someone.

50:06.637 --> 50:10.751
How about I tell you a secret,
and then you tell me one?

50:10.775 --> 50:12.710
- I can't.

50:14.845 --> 50:17.248
- Is it a bad secret?

50:20.718 --> 50:24.698
- You're supposed to
tell spooky stories.

50:24.722 --> 50:26.700
- Tell me one.

50:26.724 --> 50:28.669
- OK, well,

50:28.693 --> 50:31.072
um...

50:31.096 --> 50:33.840
Oh, I know. How about we
make one up together?

50:33.864 --> 50:36.177
I'll start. We're gonna
tell a spooky story!

50:36.201 --> 50:38.379
- Oh!

50:38.403 --> 50:42.383
- Once upon a time, there was

50:42.407 --> 50:45.386
a haunted house.

50:45.410 --> 50:48.222
And in the haunted house,

50:48.246 --> 50:50.624
there lived a witch

50:50.648 --> 50:54.561
with long black hair

50:54.585 --> 50:57.464
and long black...

50:57.488 --> 50:59.766
fingernails.

50:59.790 --> 51:02.636
And all the children
in the neighbourhood

51:02.660 --> 51:06.140
were afraid of her,

51:06.164 --> 51:08.275
because five years
earlier, she...

51:08.299 --> 51:12.146
- Murdered someone.

51:12.170 --> 51:16.350
- Yeah. Yeah.

51:16.374 --> 51:18.452
She murdered someone

51:18.476 --> 51:21.655
on Halloween!
- Shh, Kaylee's sleeping!

51:21.679 --> 51:23.648
- Or so everyone believed.

51:25.750 --> 51:28.229
And every October,

51:28.253 --> 51:31.598
when the moon was
full in the sky,

51:31.622 --> 51:33.800
and the leaves would fall

51:33.824 --> 51:36.337
from the trees,

51:36.361 --> 51:38.405
all the children avoided

51:38.429 --> 51:41.775
walking by her house,
because she...

51:41.799 --> 51:43.710
- Because she would hit them
with a pan and put their bodies

51:43.734 --> 51:46.713
in the trunk, then drive
them into the woods

51:46.737 --> 51:51.452
and throw them out. And
she'd park the car far away

51:51.476 --> 51:54.755
and leave the purse inside.

51:54.779 --> 51:57.114
Always.

52:08.226 --> 52:11.872
- That's an incredibly
detailed story there, bud.

52:11.896 --> 52:15.409
- Whew! You're a good
storyteller, Eric.

52:15.433 --> 52:17.878
Um, I'm confused though.

52:17.902 --> 52:21.248
Why does she park
the car far away,

52:21.272 --> 52:23.841
and why did she leave
the purse in the car?

52:27.745 --> 52:29.856
- If the car gets
stolen, then...

52:29.880 --> 52:32.650
Well, I don't really know.

52:35.820 --> 52:38.189
But the police never,
ever catch her.

52:50.435 --> 52:52.979
- I just gotta replace
this timing belt,

52:53.003 --> 52:55.849
and then we're ready to roll!
- How long is that gonna take?

52:55.873 --> 52:58.252
- A couple hours, once
it comes in, but I had

52:58.276 --> 53:01.322
to order one special.
- Well, when's that gonna be?

53:01.346 --> 53:04.415
- Should be Thursday.

53:06.584 --> 53:08.629
- OK. So I'll pick
Eric up from school

53:08.653 --> 53:10.564
on Thursday and then we're out of here.
- Now wait a minute.

53:10.588 --> 53:13.300
You didn't say nothing
about bringing that kid.

53:13.324 --> 53:15.669
- What did you think I was gonna do?
Did you think I was gonna leave him?

53:15.693 --> 53:18.839
- I dunno, he's...

53:18.863 --> 53:22.243
old enough to look
after himself.

53:22.267 --> 53:24.302
- We're a package deal.

53:27.405 --> 53:31.017
Come on. I'm not gonna let him
interfere with any of our...

53:31.041 --> 53:33.311
adult time, hmm?

53:36.781 --> 53:40.494
- OK, but it's my trailer,
so it's my rules.

53:40.518 --> 53:44.498
- You just keep thinking
about all the body shots

53:44.522 --> 53:46.700
we're gonna be doing on some...
- Oh, God.

53:46.724 --> 53:51.305
- Secluded beach in Mexico.
- Ohhh, mamacita.

53:51.329 --> 53:54.031
You could talk me into anything.

54:27.565 --> 54:30.677
- Hey, Eric. I can't believe you're
still alive and your brother's dead.

54:30.701 --> 54:32.913
Max was so much
cooler than you are.

54:32.937 --> 54:35.949
- He was my half-brother.
We had different dads.

54:35.973 --> 54:38.385
- He might have been your half-
brother, but he was two times

54:38.409 --> 54:40.921
better than you. I wish you
would have drowned instead!

54:40.945 --> 54:42.889
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Well, you don't have a choice.

54:42.913 --> 54:45.326
- Hey! Hey, hands off!

54:45.350 --> 54:47.794
- Jordan said I
should have drowned.

54:47.818 --> 54:50.030
- That's not true.
- Yeah, Jordan never said that.

54:50.054 --> 54:52.633
Eric started it. - Alright.

54:52.657 --> 54:55.702
Jordan, Remy, on the
bleachers for a time out.

54:55.726 --> 54:59.373
Eric, back in line-up.
- Coach, that's not fair!

54:59.397 --> 55:02.108
- You listen to me. You
guys are both really lucky

55:02.132 --> 55:04.110
that no one in your
family has died.

55:04.134 --> 55:06.647
Now, for the next 15 minutes,

55:06.671 --> 55:08.915
you are gonna sit there, and
you are gonna quietly think

55:08.939 --> 55:11.442
about how Eric feels to
have lost his brother.

55:16.481 --> 55:18.625
Back in line-up.

55:18.649 --> 55:21.318
Alright, guys,
back on the field!

55:33.531 --> 55:36.577
- Do you even love me? At all?

55:36.601 --> 55:39.504
I don't think that you do.

55:43.841 --> 55:46.511
- I love you, Mom.

55:51.115 --> 55:53.618
- And what are these?

55:57.955 --> 56:00.634
You like that coach and his
wife better than you like me.

56:00.658 --> 56:03.504
- No...
- You ungrateful little brat!

56:03.528 --> 56:07.073
That's why you want to stay here so bad!
You'd pass up

56:07.097 --> 56:08.942
Disneyland to stay with
your stupid coach?

56:08.966 --> 56:11.436
- Please, don't be mad at me.

56:16.607 --> 56:19.820
Mom? Mom! Please don't leave.

56:19.844 --> 56:22.613
- I need some alone time.

56:42.633 --> 56:45.536
- No, no, no! One
of them is for you.

56:47.705 --> 56:50.917
- You're happy tonight.
What are we drinking to?

56:50.941 --> 56:53.920
- This is the last time you're ever
gonna see me in this hellhole.

56:53.944 --> 56:56.957
- Hm.
- No offense to you.

56:56.981 --> 56:58.959
So, to new beginnings?

56:58.983 --> 57:01.519
- New beginnings.

57:14.231 --> 57:16.166
Daddy's home!

57:20.905 --> 57:23.608
That can't be.

57:26.010 --> 57:28.579
Man, look at you dance!

57:33.818 --> 57:36.763
Oh. Whoo. Whoo!

57:36.787 --> 57:38.856
Baby!

57:47.732 --> 57:50.877
- Eric! Hi.

57:50.901 --> 57:54.214
I want you to meet
my friend Shane.

57:54.238 --> 57:57.107
He's gonna be taking
us on a little trip.

58:01.145 --> 58:03.824
Say hello, Eric!

58:03.848 --> 58:06.627
- Hi.
- Hello.

58:06.651 --> 58:10.087
Oh, uh, I'm gonna go.

58:12.623 --> 58:16.002
You don't talk right.
- Come on, forget it.

58:16.026 --> 58:18.004
- You gotta learn
some Spanish, kid.

58:18.028 --> 58:20.641
- Come on!
- Mas tequila!

58:20.665 --> 58:22.933
Por favor.

58:29.907 --> 58:32.853
I woke up this morning and
it was outside my door.

58:32.877 --> 58:36.189
Pretty cool, don't you think?
- What is it, exactly? Is it

58:36.213 --> 58:38.291
a bird? - Not sure.

58:38.315 --> 58:41.828
If it were a bird, it
would have wings, right?

58:41.852 --> 58:45.089
- Maybe it's a dinosaur!
- Well...

59:20.925 --> 59:23.136
- Eric! Hi.

59:23.160 --> 59:25.105
- I need to talk to Coach.
It's an emergency.

59:25.129 --> 59:27.007
- Honey, what's wrong?
What happened?

59:27.031 --> 59:29.233
- Hey.

59:32.236 --> 59:35.348
- What is this?
- My mom wants us to leave

59:35.372 --> 59:38.018
with this guy Shane, and she
said we're going to Disney World

59:38.042 --> 59:40.242
but I think we're going to
Mexico and never coming back!

59:42.379 --> 59:45.058
Please don't let me.

59:45.082 --> 59:47.728
Please don't let me leave. I
don't wanna go with Shane.

59:47.752 --> 59:49.863
- OK. Who's Shane?

59:49.887 --> 59:51.832
- He's this guy that comes
over to our house and goes

59:51.856 --> 59:55.235
in the bedroom with my mom.
- OK.

59:55.259 --> 59:57.771
Listen. Listen to me.

59:57.795 --> 01:00:00.406
Everything's going to be alright.
OK?

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.176
Tomorrow after practice I'm
gonna swing by your house

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.111
and I'm gonna have a
little chat with your mom.

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:07.080
And then hopefully,
after I talk with her,

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.181
we can just... we can
work it all out.

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:11.184
- No, you can't.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:13.419
If she finds out that I told
you, she'll be really mad.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.212
Just please let
me live with you.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:22.262
The coroner's office confirmed
today that the body

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.731
of a woman found earlier
this week is indeed

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:26.967
that of missing woman
Barbara Nolan.

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:29.269
The cause of death has
not yet been determined.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:31.838
We spoke earlier today with
members of the victim's family,

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:33.840
who describe Mrs. Nolan as

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:36.300
kind, generous, and taken far...

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:54.160
Mom?

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:57.321
Mom?

01:00:59.757 --> 01:01:02.002
I think she might have
fallen asleep or something.

01:01:02.026 --> 01:01:05.739
- OK. Well, you've
got my cell number,

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:08.875
so have her give me a
call tomorrow, OK?

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:11.244
You have a good night, kiddo.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:14.380
Don't leave me hangin'.

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:16.841
Scram.

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:37.771
- If she wants to pull
him out of school,

01:01:37.795 --> 01:01:40.140
there's nothing we
can do to stop that.

01:01:40.164 --> 01:01:44.144
- I can't just let this
woman uproot her kid

01:01:44.168 --> 01:01:47.013
and take him God knows where.

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:48.873
She might not even put
him back in school.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:54.287
- The only way to stop that

01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:56.480
is to open an
investigation with CPS.

01:01:58.983 --> 01:02:01.027
And to do that,

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:03.888
we need to prove
suspicion of abuse.

01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:09.760
- Let's call 'em.

01:02:25.943 --> 01:02:29.313
- Coach?
- Hey, Eric.

01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:35.461
- Did you talk to my mom yet?

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:38.355
- Not yet. But I'm working
on your situation, OK?

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:43.027
You're gonna have to trust me.

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:47.764
- I trust you.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:33.887
- May I help you?
- Briana Wilson?

01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:36.556
I'm detective Jan Myers,
from the Philadelphia PD.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.159
Could I come in?

01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:41.251
- Of course.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:50.236
Uh, sorry about the mess. Um,

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:54.140
I have a few projects
I've been working on.

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:57.343
- Is your son Eric here?

01:03:57.367 --> 01:04:00.613
- No, uh... He asked to play

01:04:00.637 --> 01:04:03.283
at the park with some of
his friends after school.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:04.985
- You've been
drinking today, huh?

01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:07.220
No, why?

01:04:07.244 --> 01:04:09.084
- I could smell it as
soon as I walked in here.

01:04:10.915 --> 01:04:14.027
- You know, um, yeah,

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:17.630
I did have a glass of wine
with lunch, so... yeah.

01:04:17.654 --> 01:04:21.134
- Well, the reason I'm
here is that I received

01:04:21.158 --> 01:04:23.236
a call from Child
Protective Services

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.039
that there might be a need
to check on your son.

01:04:26.063 --> 01:04:28.508
- Check on him? Why?
- There's some concern

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:31.001
that he's being
neglected and abused.

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:35.248
- Who suspects that?

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:37.683
- I'm not at liberty to say,
but I'm here to take a look

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:40.044
at his living conditions.
Could I see his bedroom?

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:45.282
- Sure, yeah. Right this way.

01:04:54.358 --> 01:04:57.603
- You guys going someplace?

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:01.207
- Nope! Just outgrew a few things.
Donating them.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.333
- Hmm.

01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:08.248
Donating some of
your clothes too?

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:11.084
- Adults need clothes too.

01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:14.111
- What about the suitcase?
- I'm getting a designer set.

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:19.425
- Is this all of the
food that you have?

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:21.727
What does Eric have
for breakfast?

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:24.197
- A granola bar? Um...

01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:28.534
And then he buys
lunch at school.

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:31.604
Are you suggesting that
I don't feed my child?

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:35.375
- No! No, I'm not suggesting anything.
I'm just asking questions.

01:05:35.399 --> 01:05:37.410
Has Eric had any
injuries lately?

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:40.313
- No.
- And are there

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:42.406
any other adults that live
in this house with you?

01:05:44.474 --> 01:05:47.087
- Just me.

01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:50.047
- What's the, uh, the park that
you said Eric's at right now?

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:54.494
- O'Connor.

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:56.997
Uh, it's on Parkway Drive.

01:05:57.021 --> 01:06:00.633
- OK. And the name of the adult

01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:03.469
who would be supervising
Eric and his friends?

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:06.672
- Cheryl. I can't
remember her last name.

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:10.076
She's the, uh, friend...
she's the mom of, uh,

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.013
one of the friends
that he's with, so...

01:06:13.037 --> 01:06:14.780
- OK. O'Connor's.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.050
- Yeah.

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:19.052
- Cheryl.
- That's the one.

01:06:19.076 --> 01:06:21.087
- Well, you know
what, I think that

01:06:21.111 --> 01:06:23.613
I have everything that I need right now.
Thank you.

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.808
- Eric!

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:45.145
Come on. We're leaving.

01:06:45.169 --> 01:06:48.214
- Why? Where are we going? Are
we going to a different city?

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:50.550
- Enough with the
questions, Eric, let's go.

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:53.586
- No, Mom, I'm not leaving!

01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:56.489
- If you don't get in that car
right now, I swear to God

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:58.424
I will leave this bike in the
park for someone to steal it!

01:06:58.448 --> 01:07:00.517
Now!

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:13.106
- I just checked
O'Connor's park,

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:15.741
where his mother told me that he was.
The kid's not there,

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:18.244
and the groundskeeper said that
he's never seen him before.

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:20.304
Let's alert patrol. We
gotta find that kid.

01:07:29.413 --> 01:07:32.358
- Come on.
- What are we doing here?

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:35.285
- Get your suitcase.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.824
Ready?

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:54.280
Come on!

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:56.273
I'll show you inside the RV.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.485
Don't touch anything.

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:26.412
- This is it!
- What is it?

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:29.314
- We're going on a
road trip with Shane.

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:32.484
Don't give me that look.
It's gonna be fun.

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:35.220
- I don't like Shane!

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:38.282
- You don't know Shane.
Just give it a chance.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:59.444
Hey! Put that back!

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:02.206
He told you not to
touch anything!

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:15.428
Ready to go?

01:09:15.452 --> 01:09:17.962
- 15 minutes. Just gotta make
sure everything's pretty

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.666
under the hood and
hook up the trailer.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:23.426
- Want something to drink?
- Yeah. Beer.

01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:43.513
- Holy crap.

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:53.223
No one's gonna take me to jail.

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:23.763
- Whoa, kid! Where do you
think you're going with that?

01:10:23.787 --> 01:10:27.267
- I'm just getting my bike.
- No.

01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:29.335
Bike stays here. There's
no room in the RV.

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:31.771
- You have tons of room.
- STAYS HERE! - My mom said

01:10:31.795 --> 01:10:33.906
I could bring my bike!
- Don't you use that tone

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:36.600
of voice with me, kid!
I said no bike.

01:10:38.768 --> 01:10:40.846
- I'm gonna ask my mom.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:42.948
- Hey, you're leaving
with me, I run the show.

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:46.752
Now maybe your mommy never
taught you any respect,

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:49.054
but I will. It's my RV,

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.247
and it's my rules. Take
your shorts down, kid.

01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:57.430
You little bastard.

01:10:57.454 --> 01:10:59.532
Alright.

01:10:59.556 --> 01:11:01.758
We'll do it your way.

01:11:04.794 --> 01:11:08.408
- Don't make me kill you.
- You're not gonna shoot me,

01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:10.009
kid, you don't even know how to
use that thing. Give me the gun!

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:13.346
Give it to me,
before you get hurt!

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:16.582
- The only person who's
gonna get hurt is you,

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:18.542
if you don't let me
and my mom leave.

01:11:21.345 --> 01:11:23.489
- Alright, I'll tell you what. You give
me the gun, I'll put the belt down,

01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:25.491
we'll get your mommy out here,
we'll have a nice big pow wow,

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:27.960
just the three of us, huh?

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:31.597
We'll make friends.
What do you think?

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:34.500
- No.

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:36.560
- You win, kid. I'll
put the belt down.

01:11:39.896 --> 01:11:42.699
I'll put the belt down.

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:08.601
- What did you do?

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:10.770
WHAT DID YOU DO?! - He hit me.

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:14.540
He shouldn't have hit me.
- Give me the gun.

01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:17.910
Give me the gun!

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:20.770
OK. OK, OK.

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:29.389
OK. We have to move his body.

01:12:29.413 --> 01:12:31.648
We have to move his body to the back.
Eric, help me!

01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:46.071
I can't believe that you killed
the guy that was gonna get us

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:49.074
to Mexico, Eric. What the
hell were you thinking?

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:51.477
- Now that he's gone, we don't have to go.
We can go home!

01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:53.646
- Nope!

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:56.573
No, we can't, Eric! God,
you don't know anything!

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:48.091
- Damn it!

01:14:04.007 --> 01:14:06.610
Detective Myers.

01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:12.682
- I already made contact with the mother.
What does he want?

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.031
- What?!

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:21.801
- What are you doing back there?
You better not be

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:23.803
fooling with that
dead body, Eric.

01:14:23.827 --> 01:14:26.739
We have to dump it somewhere.
- I'm not, Mom.

01:14:26.763 --> 01:14:29.909
- Do you know what police do to
people that commit murder, Eric?

01:14:29.933 --> 01:14:33.245
Do you?!

01:14:33.269 --> 01:14:36.015
We have to get as far away
from here as possible.

01:14:36.039 --> 01:14:40.252
- I just want to be with Coach.

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:42.178
- OK. At least he
filled up the tank. OK.

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:48.060
Oh God, Eric, don't
start crying.

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:50.095
I have to concentrate!

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:52.656
I have to concentrate on not
getting us pulled over!

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.654
- I lost the call on the way
over, but he said he was

01:15:14.678 --> 01:15:17.890
going to Mexico. If I call back,
I'm afraid it's going to ring.

01:15:17.914 --> 01:15:19.992
- That's OK. We can ping the
phone for a location. Paul?

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:22.294
- I'm on it.
- I'm guessing,

01:15:22.318 --> 01:15:25.164
if they're heading south, they're
probably on 95 or Interstate 10...

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:26.732
- They could have
swung out and hit 81

01:15:26.744 --> 01:15:28.300
to avoid traffic.
- He didn't give you

01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:31.270
any description of the RV, huh?
- The call dropped before I could ask.

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:33.939
- Am I even going the right way?

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:37.342
Eric, hand me my phone,
it's in my purse!

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:40.012
Hurry up!

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:42.748
- I don't see it, Mom!
- Look harder!

01:15:42.772 --> 01:15:46.118
- It's not in here!
- Just give me my purse!

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:49.288
- I think I saw you put
it down in the car.

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:53.859
- The car?! THE CAR THAT
WAS PARKED AT SHANE'S?

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:58.263
WE DON'T HAVE A PHONE?!
Damn it! Damn it!

01:15:58.287 --> 01:15:59.281
- How long is it gonna take to

01:15:59.293 --> 01:16:00.299
ping the phone? - Not very long.

01:16:00.323 --> 01:16:03.235
Hey, Paul! I don't have a
warrant to get into her house,

01:16:03.259 --> 01:16:05.270
but can you just walk
around outside and see

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:07.239
if there's anything there
that I would have missed?

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:09.975
- Sure. You got an address?
- Uh, it's Carson Heights.

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:12.211
Literally. Not that far away from
the Nolan house. - Yeah, I got it.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:14.213
I'll check it out myself.
- Thank you.

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:17.883
- The Nolan house?
- Yeah, uh,

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:22.722
an older lady. We found her body
dumped out near Kern Campground.

01:16:22.746 --> 01:16:25.715
- Kern Campground?
- What? You know something?

01:16:27.951 --> 01:16:30.095
- Where did you find the car?
- It was abandoned

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:32.689
down in Exeter Crest.

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:40.706
- The story's true.
- What story? What are you talking about?

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:43.375
- Eric. He spent a night

01:16:43.399 --> 01:16:46.311
at our house. We had a
campfire in the backyard.

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:48.648
And he starts telling
this really graphic

01:16:48.672 --> 01:16:51.350
ghost story about this
witch who kills people

01:16:51.374 --> 01:16:53.986
and then dumps their
bodies in the woods.

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:56.355
She parks the car somewhere
else, and she leaves

01:16:56.379 --> 01:16:59.759
the purse in the car.
It was all really weird

01:16:59.783 --> 01:17:02.662
and it was really detailed.
So I asked him.

01:17:02.686 --> 01:17:04.997
I said, "Why does she leave
a purse in the car?"

01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:07.767
And he tells me,

01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:11.303
"So if the car gets stolen,
the police won't catch her."

01:17:11.327 --> 01:17:13.706
- Really?

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:17.000
- I think he may have witnessed
that woman's murder.

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:33.759
- I gotta go buy a map.

01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:36.953
Stay here.

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:57.983
- It's him.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:01.386
Hey. Listen, pal,

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:04.023
we need you to tell us what
the RV you're in looks like.

01:18:04.047 --> 01:18:06.182
- Uhh, hang on.

01:18:20.129 --> 01:18:23.132
- Smart kid. OK, can you
show us the license plate?

01:18:30.506 --> 01:18:32.852
Got it. - I have to go inside.

01:18:32.876 --> 01:18:35.711
She's gonna come back soon.

01:18:38.782 --> 01:18:41.017
- Eric, the man that
you said you shot,

01:18:43.987 --> 01:18:46.031
- I don't know.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.933
- But the RV that you're
in, it's his, right?

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:50.369
Uhh, yeah.

01:18:50.393 --> 01:18:52.004
Can you go and find
something in the glove box.

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:54.130
Umm...

01:19:10.313 --> 01:19:12.381
- Canada.

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:23.392
- Shane Reese.

01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:32.177
Eric, where are you right now?

01:19:32.201 --> 01:19:34.379
- What's the name of the place?

01:19:34.403 --> 01:19:38.083
- I don't know, but she's
coming so just don't let her

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:40.944
I muted it.

01:19:50.153 --> 01:19:52.397
- We got 'em. Heading
south on 95.

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:55.234
- That's great.

01:19:55.258 --> 01:20:00.063
I need an APB on a white
2006 RV heading south on 95.

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:13.986
- I'm going with you.

01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:16.145
- Don't worry, I'll
keep you apprised.

01:20:39.002 --> 01:20:41.113
- Why did we turn around?
This is the same direction

01:20:41.137 --> 01:20:43.548
we came from!
- Shut up, Eric! We have

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:46.085
a dead body in here. We have
to find somewhere to dump it.

01:20:46.109 --> 01:20:48.044
It's gonna start to
stink after a while.

01:20:50.947 --> 01:20:54.093
- Detective? Eric just said
that they've changed direction.

01:20:54.117 --> 01:20:56.419
They're heading north.

01:21:15.939 --> 01:21:17.573
- You know the drill.

01:21:21.945 --> 01:21:24.689
- ERIC! GET UP AND HELP ME.

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.649
NOW!

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:33.422
Pull.

01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:42.131
- I bet they're
dumping the body.

01:21:58.347 --> 01:22:01.126
- That's good enough.
- It's better over there.

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:03.262
- No, you can't see it
from the road, it's fine.

01:22:03.286 --> 01:22:06.065
- It's darker over there...
- NO!

01:22:06.089 --> 01:22:08.591
Come on, Eric! Let's go!

01:22:20.336 --> 01:22:23.682
- We can't cross the border
with blood on the RV.

01:22:23.706 --> 01:22:26.075
There's gotta be cleaning
supplies somewhere.

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:44.027
Hello? - Hello.

01:22:48.597 --> 01:22:52.277
- What did you do?!
Did you call them?

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:54.446
Did you tell them where we are?!
- No.

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:57.649
- You lying little brat!
What is wrong with you?

01:22:57.673 --> 01:23:00.252
Can't you see I'm trying
like hell to protect you,

01:23:00.276 --> 01:23:02.487
to keep you from jail?!
And this is what you do,

01:23:02.511 --> 01:23:04.656
you betray me?! God!

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.658
- I didn't want to go away!
- Oh,

01:23:06.682 --> 01:23:08.793
you're going away, all right.
To a six by nine cell!

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:11.163
GOD, YOU'RE SO STUPID!

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:13.289
Max was never this idiotic!

01:23:15.358 --> 01:23:17.402
- OK. We're close.

01:23:17.426 --> 01:23:19.438
- How could you do this to me?

01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:22.207
After all that
I've done for you!

01:23:22.231 --> 01:23:24.109
- I just... I didn't want
to leave and I don't want

01:23:24.133 --> 01:23:26.545
to kill anyone anymore!

01:23:26.569 --> 01:23:29.048
- You shot Shane.
YOU shot Shane!

01:23:29.072 --> 01:23:32.175
And YOU told Mrs. Nolan God
knows what to come over!

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:48.433
- Briana Wilson! Come out with
your hands where we can see them!

01:23:48.457 --> 01:23:52.137
You have to the count of ten!
- No more killing, Mom!

01:23:52.161 --> 01:23:54.306
- Come here.

01:23:54.330 --> 01:23:57.476
You stay in front of me!

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:00.203
Here we go.

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:09.221
- Don't do it! Briana,
put the gun down!

01:24:09.245 --> 01:24:11.223
- It's OK, Eric, honey. You
just stay right in front of me.

01:24:11.247 --> 01:24:13.092
- Put the gun down!

01:24:13.116 --> 01:24:16.228
Put the gun down, Briana.

01:24:16.252 --> 01:24:19.098
Put it down!

01:24:19.122 --> 01:24:22.101
- Eric!
- Michael!

01:24:22.125 --> 01:24:24.636
- No! Eric! ERIC!

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.529
- Briana, put it down!

01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:32.677
- Are you hurt?

01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:35.680
- Put the gun down, Briana!

01:24:35.704 --> 01:24:38.107
Don't move!

01:24:41.144 --> 01:24:44.656
Don't move, don't do it!

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.625
- Don't look, don't look!
- I WON'T LET YOU.

01:24:46.649 --> 01:24:49.385
TAKE MY SON! - Don't do it!

01:24:52.621 --> 01:24:54.490
- Did they kill my mom?!

01:24:56.625 --> 01:24:59.162
- No, she's gonna be OK.

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:09.648
- Am I going to jail?

01:25:09.672 --> 01:25:11.683
- No. No, it's gonna be OK.

01:25:11.707 --> 01:25:13.909
It's gonna be OK.
You gotta trust me.

01:25:45.408 --> 01:25:47.419
- Thanks for the helmet.
I'll wear it every time

01:25:47.443 --> 01:25:49.521
I ride my bike.
- Good. I want you

01:25:49.545 --> 01:25:51.556
to be safe out there.

01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:55.294
Alright, listen, kiddo.
I gotta scoot.

01:25:55.318 --> 01:25:57.462
But, um...

01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:59.531
You know, if it's
OK with Miss Liz,

01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:01.666
maybe next weekend you can come
to our place for a barbecue.

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:04.403
And then afterwards, we
can head to the park.

01:26:04.427 --> 01:26:07.439
- Sure.
- Time for lunch!

01:26:07.463 --> 01:26:09.365
- Oh, wait! Um...

01:26:12.235 --> 01:26:14.313
Uh, this is for Kaylee. It's...

01:26:14.337 --> 01:26:16.348
I drew her a picture
of a princess.

01:26:16.372 --> 01:26:18.617
- She's gonna love this.

01:26:18.641 --> 01:26:21.720
Who's the other one for?
- My mom.

01:26:21.744 --> 01:26:24.580
Could you put the address of the
prison on it and mail it to her?

01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:30.853
- 'Course I can.

01:26:55.678 --> 01:26:57.613
See ya on Friday, champ.

01:27:05.688 --> 01:27:08.924
Think fast! Here it comes!
Yeah, good catch!

01:27:12.295 --> 01:27:14.839
OK, keep your eye on the ball, Eric!
- Ahh!

01:27:14.863 --> 01:27:16.765
- Good! Nice, with
your bare hand!
