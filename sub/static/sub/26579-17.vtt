<i>♪ I can still taste you
on my lips ♪</i>

00:08.781 --> 00:10.086
It's just not a term

00:10.172 --> 00:12.781
you expect to hear
in 2019, you know?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.953
"Grave robber."

00:15.202 --> 00:18.197
It's like chimney sweep.

00:18.610 --> 00:20.110
Alchemist.

00:22.155 --> 00:23.852
- Fishmonger.
- Keep naming old-ass jobs

00:23.938 --> 00:25.446
and your next one's gonna be
at Medieval Times.

00:25.531 --> 00:27.070
Copy that.

00:27.625 --> 00:29.400
There he is.

00:29.485 --> 00:31.703
If he starts digging up
body parts to make a monster,

00:31.789 --> 00:33.391
you're on your own.

00:35.655 --> 00:37.069
Police!

00:37.162 --> 00:39.045
Geez. You scared me.

00:39.131 --> 00:41.287
- Get out of there.
- It's okay. This is my mom.

00:41.397 --> 00:43.070
And you missed her so much
you had to dig her up?

00:43.155 --> 00:44.975
No,
she's got my jewelry.

00:45.162 --> 00:46.515
She was supposed
to leave it to me,

00:46.600 --> 00:48.764
but they buried her with it,
and now I need it.

00:48.850 --> 00:50.045
To buy drugs?

00:50.131 --> 00:51.100
No.

00:51.186 --> 00:52.483
Okay.
Come on. Come on.

00:52.569 --> 00:54.076
Climb on out
of there.

00:54.257 --> 00:56.092
Hands over your head.

00:56.405 --> 00:58.287
Interlace
your fingers.

00:59.235 --> 01:01.256
I really do miss her.

01:01.342 --> 01:04.013
She's the only person
that ever believed in me.

01:04.185 --> 01:06.115
I've been so lost
since she's been dead.

01:06.201 --> 01:08.397
Then maybe you should this
as an opportunity

01:08.483 --> 01:09.608
to get
your life straight.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.900
You know what?
Get clean.

01:12.077 --> 01:13.492
Make your mother
proud.

01:13.663 --> 01:14.958
Yeah.

01:15.051 --> 01:16.796
Yeah,
I'm going to do that.

01:17.022 --> 01:18.756
I'm gonna
turn my life around.

01:18.975 --> 01:20.416
I'm gonna get clean.

01:20.501 --> 01:21.881
For Mom!

01:26.711 --> 01:28.296
It's gonna be one
of those nights, isn't it?

01:28.381 --> 01:29.805
Yep.

01:31.171 --> 01:32.420
Come on. Get up.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.617
Come on. I got ya.

01:36.001 --> 01:37.664
Come on.

01:40.239 --> 01:41.688
What?

01:42.663 --> 01:44.123
She's over there.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.086
I remember that statue
from the funeral.

01:50.539 --> 01:52.079
I'll put him in the shop.

01:57.001 --> 01:59.125
It still doesn't
feel real.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.578
Yeah.

02:00.804 --> 02:04.102
But life goes on
whether we like it or not.

02:08.001 --> 02:10.531
Okay.
Back to it.

02:36.501 --> 02:37.876
Oh, I could
get used to this.

02:37.961 --> 02:39.126
Right?

02:39.211 --> 02:40.916
They don't have this
in D.C.

02:41.001 --> 02:43.416
Nope. Just an equal amount
of self-absorbed people.

02:43.501 --> 02:44.916
Mm-hmm. Only they're
far more pale.

02:45.001 --> 02:46.256
Yes.

02:46.341 --> 02:47.916
Which is why
you should spend

02:48.001 --> 02:50.376
more than a few days a month
down here with me.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.626
Oh,
I wish I could.

02:52.711 --> 02:55.166
But I landed this big
security contract in Virginia.

02:55.251 --> 02:57.086
Nice.
Which reminds me.

02:57.171 --> 02:59.296
Um, there's this thing
that I heard about

02:59.381 --> 03:02.256
that I think...
you should volunteer for.

03:02.341 --> 03:03.876
I love volunteering
for things.

03:03.961 --> 03:05.416
What's the thing?

03:05.501 --> 03:08.836
Well, uh, a friend of mine
is an ADA out here,

03:08.921 --> 03:10.086
and he mentioned
that he's gonna be

03:10.171 --> 03:12.046
reaching out to your station
for manpower

03:12.131 --> 03:13.466
for a protection detail.

03:13.551 --> 03:16.626
Some high-powered witness
in a safe house.

03:16.711 --> 03:17.966
Sounds like fun.

03:18.051 --> 03:20.055
And some
valuable experience.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.045
How can I ever
thank you?

03:22.131 --> 03:24.966
Oh, I'm sure I will think
of a few ways.

03:25.051 --> 03:27.727
I'm sure you will.

03:28.131 --> 03:31.125
We're talking about sex, though, right?
Yeah.

03:31.641 --> 03:33.336
Per Captain Weatherby,

03:33.430 --> 03:37.055
the following protocol changes
will take place immediately.

03:37.341 --> 03:39.626
No more putting any boots
on top of lockers.

03:39.711 --> 03:41.586
Any boots left on top of lockers

03:41.671 --> 03:44.586
will be thrown away
at midnight and noon daily.

03:44.671 --> 03:47.376
Second, every officer
must provide a business card

03:47.461 --> 03:49.416
to every citizen
they contact.

03:49.501 --> 03:51.336
If a citizen doesn't want
a business card,

03:51.421 --> 03:53.256
the officer must write
a police report

03:53.341 --> 03:57.466
and document the fact the
citizen refused a business card.

03:57.551 --> 03:59.586
Sir, with all due respect,
this sucks.

03:59.727 --> 04:02.796
Ours is not to judge,
Officer Lopez.

04:02.881 --> 04:05.336
Command believes that the
captain's focus on efficiency

04:05.421 --> 04:07.680
is what Mid-Wilshire
needs right now.

04:10.304 --> 04:12.559
Captain.
Can I help you?

04:12.715 --> 04:14.805
I need an updated
vehicle list.

04:14.961 --> 04:16.586
Yes, sir. I'm in the middle
of roll call.

04:16.671 --> 04:17.921
I'll get it to you
right after.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.382
But since you're here,
would you like to

04:20.551 --> 04:23.281
say anything inspirational
to day shift?

04:26.543 --> 04:28.188
Did you tell them
about the boots?

04:28.513 --> 04:31.388
Yes, sir.
Oh. Okay.

04:31.474 --> 04:33.134
Well, uh...

04:35.001 --> 04:36.961
Keep up the, uh...

04:38.013 --> 04:39.842
good work.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.898
Alright.

04:47.131 --> 04:48.898
Last bit of business.

04:49.270 --> 04:52.347
District Attorney's office
has a witness on ice.

04:52.433 --> 04:54.453
They need our help
watching them.

04:54.791 --> 04:56.756
I usually don't assign rookies

04:56.841 --> 04:58.796
these type of details,
Officer Nolan.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.756
And Officer Bishop
would have to agree.

05:01.841 --> 05:05.166
Forget it. Protection details
are like watching paint dry.

05:05.251 --> 05:06.756
Looks like
you're out of luck.

05:06.841 --> 05:07.984
I'll do it.

05:09.068 --> 05:11.915
And Nolan and I haven't had
a chance to "bond" yet.

05:15.001 --> 05:16.376
Great.

05:16.461 --> 05:18.566
Alright. Bishop,
you'll be riding with Chen.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.086
That's it.

05:20.171 --> 05:22.256
Oh, and remember...

05:22.341 --> 05:24.436
when you take
your shops in at night,

05:24.521 --> 05:26.566
you now have to
drive by the garage

05:26.651 --> 05:30.106
to get a mechanical inspection
and mileage report.

05:30.191 --> 05:31.805
You're welcome.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.946
You're right,
this sucks.

05:34.157 --> 05:36.436
For you. 'Cause I'll be home eating
dinner while you're doing all that.

05:36.521 --> 05:39.340
<i>Officer West
to the front desk. Visitor.</i>

05:39.735 --> 05:41.046
I'll be right back.

05:41.131 --> 05:44.149
Make it fast. Captain's put
a clock on our roll out.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.247
Hey.
Hey.

05:48.442 --> 05:50.403
Um, what are you
doing here?

05:50.591 --> 05:52.731
You... left something
at my place.

05:52.817 --> 05:56.090
Um, I just can't
really have visitors here.

05:56.176 --> 05:58.301
Look, I just...
I just really want to keep

05:58.420 --> 06:00.762
my personal and work life
separate.

06:01.585 --> 06:03.161
Fine.

06:03.527 --> 06:06.082
You left your off-duty weapon
at my place.

06:08.309 --> 06:09.731
I can't believe
I did that.

06:09.861 --> 06:11.676
Yeah, you were
a little distracted.

06:12.097 --> 06:13.254
Look,
you don't understand.

06:13.341 --> 06:15.270
If anybody found out
about this, I'd get fired.

06:15.356 --> 06:16.473
Immediately.

06:16.559 --> 06:17.857
And, like, what...
Why would you bring it here?

06:17.942 --> 06:19.301
What if you got
pulled over?

06:19.387 --> 06:20.702
You're mad at me
about this?

06:20.901 --> 06:22.465
No, look...

06:22.551 --> 06:23.855
I got to get to work.

06:23.941 --> 06:25.786
I'm sorry, Gino.
I...

06:25.977 --> 06:27.162
Yeah.

06:27.341 --> 06:29.317
Hey, Boot.
What's the holdup?

06:29.636 --> 06:31.801
Uh, nothing.
Sorry.

06:31.887 --> 06:34.255
I just...
Actually, can I, uh...

06:34.341 --> 06:36.341
Can I just get a minute?
I need to hit the locker room.

06:36.442 --> 06:38.825
30 seconds or I fail you
for the day.

06:43.434 --> 06:45.179
Must have left
his boots up.

06:45.374 --> 06:47.325
You up to date
on protection detail protocols?

06:47.473 --> 06:49.436
I think so. Okay. We use
the "Loser System"...

06:49.521 --> 06:50.986
Named for the losers
we protect.

06:51.071 --> 06:54.256
L-O-S-R... Listen, Observe,
Secure, Report.

06:54.341 --> 06:55.756
You listen
for any movement,

06:55.841 --> 06:57.966
changes or information
that impact the mission,

06:58.051 --> 06:59.325
observe
the subject's behavior,

06:59.411 --> 07:01.295
changes in the environment,
et cetera.

07:01.381 --> 07:03.942
Secure... make sure no threats
infiltrate the perimeter,

07:04.028 --> 07:05.445
and, finally, report.

07:05.531 --> 07:08.065
Report any suspicious activity,
no matter how minor,

07:08.151 --> 07:09.986
to your superior officer
immediately.

07:10.078 --> 07:12.233
- That means me.
- What about "e"?

07:12.860 --> 07:14.275
"Loser" has an "e."

07:14.559 --> 07:16.585
"E" is for "engage,"
which is left out

07:16.671 --> 07:18.126
because you are not
to engage the subject

07:18.211 --> 07:19.646
unless it's
a life-threatening emergency.

07:19.731 --> 07:20.916
We're here
to guard this guy,

07:21.001 --> 07:22.248
not braid his hair
and be besties.

07:22.333 --> 07:23.665
- That understood?
- Understood.

07:23.751 --> 07:24.880
I don't even know
how to braid hair.

07:24.965 --> 07:26.965
I was gonna learn if we had
a daughter, but...

07:27.481 --> 07:29.059
Never mind.

07:35.936 --> 07:37.266
Police!

07:39.863 --> 07:41.255
You alright?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:41.341 --> 07:42.849
Thanks. He got me
when I wasn't looking.

07:42.934 --> 07:44.958
You're under arrest
for assaulting an officer.

07:45.044 --> 07:46.605
He's the one
who should be arrested.

07:46.691 --> 07:49.416
He said he'd rip up the ticket
if I gave him $100.

07:49.501 --> 07:50.966
- That's not true.
- Like hell it isn't! Hey!

07:51.051 --> 07:52.365
Sir, there's no use in lying.
Alright?

07:52.450 --> 07:53.701
Whatever really happened
is gonna be on

07:53.786 --> 07:55.192
the officer's
body camera.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.848
Where's
your body camera?

07:59.545 --> 08:00.965
Um...

08:01.551 --> 08:02.776
it's, uh...
It's in the car.

08:02.861 --> 08:05.226
It was on the fritz.
I'll... I'll go get it.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.225
Officer, wait!

08:15.457 --> 08:18.331
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car now!

08:18.417 --> 08:19.936
- Okay, take it easy. Take...
- Get out of the car.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.256
Take it easy, man.
Come on.

08:21.342 --> 08:22.326
Interlace your fingers
and face

08:22.412 --> 08:23.881
- the car.
- Okay, okay, okay.

08:25.051 --> 08:26.870
It's just
a big misunderstanding.

08:26.956 --> 08:28.638
Can't we just... Can't we just
talk this out, you know?

08:28.723 --> 08:30.408
Cop to cop?
You're not a cop.

08:30.501 --> 08:32.644
And impersonating a law
enforcement officer is a felony.

08:32.729 --> 08:33.870
I want a lawyer.

08:34.024 --> 08:35.706
Maybe you
can impersonate one.

08:42.982 --> 08:44.647
That's the safe house.

08:45.032 --> 08:47.399
7-Adam-19 on scene
at the mutual aid call.

08:47.516 --> 08:48.776
Will make contact
in 10 seconds.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.266
<i>Roger, 7-Adam-19.</i>

08:53.692 --> 08:55.917
LAPD,
Bradford and Nolan.

08:58.762 --> 09:00.927
- Uh, Officer Nolan?
- Nolan.

09:01.013 --> 09:02.588
Hey,
I'm ADA Sean DelMonte.

09:02.674 --> 09:04.489
Jessica Russo told me
you'd be helping out.

09:04.651 --> 09:06.160
Sir, Officer Nolan
is a rookie.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.457
I'm his superior officer,
Tim Bradford.

09:08.670 --> 09:11.582
Oh. Sorry. I just assumed
that he'd be in charge.

09:11.670 --> 09:14.205
The last guy Jessica dated
was a Navy SEAL. Seriously?

09:14.291 --> 09:16.686
Yeah. Talk about a strong
handshake, like a vise grip...

09:16.771 --> 09:18.611
Okay, can we get the download
on our protectee?

09:18.745 --> 09:20.620
Of course. Yeah.

09:20.806 --> 09:22.293
Brad Hayes.

09:22.551 --> 09:25.065
Worked Border Patrol
for 12 years down in Temecula.

09:25.151 --> 09:26.902
Rose to second in command.

09:27.051 --> 09:28.966
Then he turned around and
started using what we taught him

09:29.051 --> 09:30.332
to help the other side.

09:30.418 --> 09:33.621
He charged the cartels a fortune
to smuggle people in and out.

09:33.918 --> 09:35.097
Now he's naming names.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.380
No wonder he's
hiding out here.

09:36.465 --> 09:39.150
Yeah, he's testifying
before a grand jury tomorrow.

09:39.236 --> 09:41.793
Look, Sheriff's Department
will coordinate shift changes.

09:41.879 --> 09:42.966
Here's my card.

09:43.051 --> 09:44.614
Use the cell number
in case anything comes up,

09:44.699 --> 09:45.646
no matter how small.

09:45.731 --> 09:47.416
Will do.
Deputy.

09:47.501 --> 09:48.666
It's very nice to meet
both of you.

09:48.751 --> 09:49.936
And, again,
sorry for the confusion.

09:50.021 --> 09:51.480
No worries.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.787
- Navy SEAL?
- Focus, Boot.

09:55.873 --> 09:57.078
Now do a sweep
of the house.

09:57.171 --> 09:58.336
Note ingress
and egress points,

09:58.421 --> 09:59.606
escape avenues,
and sight lines.

09:59.691 --> 10:01.936
Report back in 10.
Yes, sir.

10:03.991 --> 10:06.136
- How's it going?
- Fine. Thanks.

10:07.243 --> 10:08.801
Oh.

10:09.226 --> 10:10.785
No "e" in "loser."

10:12.809 --> 10:14.371
Hey.

10:14.964 --> 10:16.941
There is an "e"
in "loser."

10:19.580 --> 10:21.775
<i>7-Adam-15,
false imprisonment call,</i>

10:21.861 --> 10:23.896
6991 West Ellroy.

10:23.982 --> 10:25.652
Code 2 high.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.145
She's got him
locked up in there!

10:30.231 --> 10:31.726
I haven't been able
to reach him in days.

10:31.811 --> 10:33.166
- Who?
- My boyfriend.

10:33.251 --> 10:34.526
Who's got him
locked up?

10:34.611 --> 10:36.084
His mother.

10:36.921 --> 10:38.086
His mother?

10:38.171 --> 10:39.506
Look, no offense,
but could it be

10:39.591 --> 10:40.986
that he just doesn't
want to see you?

10:41.071 --> 10:42.466
No,
she's really strict,

10:42.551 --> 10:44.295
and she hates
that we're together.

10:44.387 --> 10:47.021
Please,
I'm really worried.

10:50.341 --> 10:51.951
Police, open up!

10:52.662 --> 10:54.710
Police!

10:58.579 --> 11:00.204
Wait! I have a key!

11:00.290 --> 11:01.725
I have a key.
Thanks.

11:02.021 --> 11:03.500
Stay back.

11:17.455 --> 11:19.244
Stop, Mom!
Please!

11:19.330 --> 11:21.783
...who sustains my life.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.466
Turn back the evil
upon my foes;

11:25.551 --> 11:28.256
in your faithfulness,
destroy them.

11:28.341 --> 11:31.206
And by the power
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

11:31.291 --> 11:32.936
may you be snatched away

11:33.021 --> 11:36.002
and driven from
the church of God.

11:38.497 --> 11:41.822
From all the souls made
in the image and likeness of God

11:41.908 --> 11:44.837
and redeemed by the Precious
Blood of the Divine Lamb,

11:44.923 --> 11:46.933
- I cast you out!
- Ow!

11:47.019 --> 11:48.267
Stop!
Get away from him!

11:48.353 --> 11:49.869
- No. No!
- That's enough.

11:49.955 --> 11:51.511
You have to let me
save him.

11:51.597 --> 11:53.300
He's been possessed
by the dark one.

11:53.386 --> 11:56.988
<i>Control, I need RA
to 6991 West Ellroy.</i>

11:57.166 --> 11:59.814
<i>Teenage Hispanic male,
suffering from dehydration.</i>

11:59.900 --> 12:02.243
What did you do to him,
you sick bitch?!

12:02.329 --> 12:04.253
- Hey.
- No! No.

12:04.339 --> 12:06.206
He's been
possessed by your filth.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.362
No.

12:07.448 --> 12:08.995
No.

12:18.790 --> 12:19.884
Sergeant.

12:20.079 --> 12:21.095
Yes.

12:21.181 --> 12:24.001
Did you countermand
my vehicle reassignment order?

12:24.454 --> 12:26.056
I thought it
was a mistake.

12:26.290 --> 12:29.071
You reassigned all
our extra shops to LAX.

12:29.297 --> 12:31.439
What are we supposed to use
if one of our cars breaks down?

12:31.524 --> 12:33.094
Inventory lists
10 mountain bikes.

12:33.180 --> 12:34.571
We'll use those.
Yeah.

12:34.657 --> 12:35.829
Exercise is good
for the soul.

12:35.915 --> 12:37.610
Less helpful in
a high-speed pursuit.

12:37.696 --> 12:39.289
I have got
a doctor's appointment

12:39.375 --> 12:40.899
and then lunch
with the Deputy Chief.

12:40.985 --> 12:43.321
So make sure those
monthly reports are on my desk

12:43.407 --> 12:45.188
- when I get back.
- Yes, sir!

12:48.596 --> 12:49.946
Wow.

12:50.544 --> 12:52.704
- He seems fun.
- Damn.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.321
What are you doing here?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.758
Uh, your wife called me.
She said that you were considering

12:56.844 --> 12:58.205
throwing the new captain
out the window.

12:58.290 --> 12:59.603
And you came
to talk me out of it?

12:59.688 --> 13:00.914
Or open the window.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.399
Whichever one
seems more productive.

13:03.485 --> 13:05.696
He's hurting morale

13:05.829 --> 13:08.024
and our ability
to do our jobs.

13:08.110 --> 13:10.868
He's not the first pencil pusher
you've worked for, right?

13:10.954 --> 13:12.524
And he probably
won't be the last.

13:12.610 --> 13:15.961
So it is your job
to find a workaround.

13:20.274 --> 13:21.891
You think the kid
will be okay?

13:22.062 --> 13:24.329
Physically, yes,
but mentally, I'm not so sure.

13:24.415 --> 13:27.196
I still can't believe a mother
would do that to her own son.

13:27.282 --> 13:29.454
Sadly, it's not the worst thing
I've seen a parent do.

13:29.540 --> 13:30.844
Oh, uh, hey.

13:30.930 --> 13:32.547
Do you mind
if I take this call?

13:32.633 --> 13:34.070
- Mm.
- Thanks.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.908
Wh... What?

13:38.002 --> 13:39.437
Mom, slow down.

13:39.523 --> 13:41.047
W... Is he okay?

13:42.289 --> 13:44.218
Did they send him
to Shaw Memorial?

13:44.508 --> 13:46.476
Okay.
Yeah, no, that's good.

13:46.562 --> 13:48.343
My dad got attacked
by one of his patients.

13:48.429 --> 13:49.984
They think
his arm is broken.

13:53.835 --> 13:55.578
I'll go as soon as
my shift's done, okay?

13:55.664 --> 13:57.445
- Boot, we'll go now.
- Oh. Okay.

13:57.531 --> 13:58.914
I'm gonna go right now,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.304
and I'll call you
right after I see him, okay?

14:01.390 --> 14:02.508
I love you, too.

14:02.594 --> 14:03.859
Um, thanks.

14:04.038 --> 14:06.148
My mom is out of town
at a conference.

14:06.234 --> 14:07.859
Are you sure
this is okay?

14:07.945 --> 14:09.510
Yeah. It's family.

14:09.595 --> 14:11.180
Control,
have a unit meet us

14:11.265 --> 14:12.992
at Shaw Memorial
for a prisoner transfer.

14:13.078 --> 14:15.172
Also, show us
10-6 personal.

14:18.635 --> 14:20.883
The whole house
is about 1,900 square feet.

14:20.969 --> 14:22.471
Upstairs, there's
two bedrooms, a bathroom,

14:22.556 --> 14:23.954
and a very small attic.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.935
Sight lines are blocked
from the east...

14:26.021 --> 14:27.586
I'm bored!

14:27.710 --> 14:29.337
Not our problem.

14:29.430 --> 14:33.195
Oh, it is killing me
not having Internet access.

14:33.358 --> 14:34.977
Or a phone.

14:35.341 --> 14:37.438
They actually gave me
newspapers.

14:37.524 --> 14:38.800
What do they think,
I'm an animal?

14:38.885 --> 14:40.650
Sir, we're here to keep you
alive, not entertained.

14:40.735 --> 14:42.680
So step back.
Let us do our job.

14:42.765 --> 14:44.134
He doesn't like me,
does he?

14:44.227 --> 14:45.720
He probably thinks
I'm a traitor.

14:45.806 --> 14:48.056
We're not here to judge you,
sir. Just keep you safe.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.759
He's very good.
Very reassuring.

14:51.108 --> 14:53.083
I'm gonna have a beer.
You guys want one?

14:53.277 --> 14:55.220
No, thank you.
Shocker.

15:08.594 --> 15:10.032
Officer Nolan.

15:10.124 --> 15:11.274
Yes, sir?

15:11.360 --> 15:12.975
I read about you
in the newspaper.

15:13.144 --> 15:15.209
Your captain got killed
in the line of duty.

15:16.851 --> 15:19.907
- Sounded like a real badass.
- She was.

15:20.001 --> 15:21.906
Your name was all over
that article.

15:22.195 --> 15:23.900
Pretty heroic stuff.

15:25.385 --> 15:27.212
Not heroic enough.

15:29.405 --> 15:31.590
<i>Respiratory therapist, 4 West.</i>

15:31.785 --> 15:34.720
<i>Respiratory therapist, 4 West.</i>

15:34.995 --> 15:36.501
Gino. Hey.

15:36.587 --> 15:37.712
Uh, I'm looking
for my dad.

15:37.798 --> 15:39.410
He was brought in a little while
ago... broken arm?

15:39.495 --> 15:41.352
Uh, yeah.
He's in Bed 2.

15:41.519 --> 15:43.584
- I'm... I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, thanks.

15:45.081 --> 15:46.496
Do we know
what his status is?

15:46.613 --> 15:48.388
Doctor saw him
and scheduled him for X-rays.

15:48.474 --> 15:50.969
Depending how bad the break is,
he might need surgery.

15:51.462 --> 15:53.430
Um, I'll goose
the process along.

15:53.515 --> 15:54.891
- Put in a room request.
- Thanks.

15:54.977 --> 15:56.204
Yeah.

16:01.444 --> 16:02.649
Hey.

16:02.735 --> 16:03.880
Are you okay?

16:03.966 --> 16:05.860
I'm fine.

16:05.946 --> 16:07.551
Your mother shouldn't
have called you.

16:07.637 --> 16:09.922
Of course she should have.
What happened?

16:10.008 --> 16:11.891
I was in the middle
of some alternative

16:11.977 --> 16:13.530
anger management therapy,

16:13.615 --> 16:15.800
and my patient
lost control.

16:15.885 --> 16:17.063
What's his name?

16:17.149 --> 16:18.254
Why?

16:18.340 --> 16:20.485
Because
he broke your arm.

16:20.623 --> 16:23.555
No, he had
a dissociative episode.

16:23.641 --> 16:24.950
He didn't mean
to hurt me.

16:25.035 --> 16:27.490
It doesn't matter.
The law is clear.

16:27.575 --> 16:28.860
The law is broken!

16:28.945 --> 16:30.470
Ow.

16:48.154 --> 16:51.516
So you think
this is the solution?

16:51.752 --> 16:53.317
To pretend
that this didn't happen?

16:53.535 --> 16:56.524
It's a better solution
than letting you lock him up.

16:57.036 --> 16:58.511
Now I'm in pain.

16:58.597 --> 17:00.782
So if you're more worried
about being a cop

17:00.868 --> 17:02.860
than being my daughter,

17:03.275 --> 17:05.259
maybe you should leave.

17:08.779 --> 17:11.003
You can sit down.
I'm not gonna bite.

17:11.199 --> 17:12.634
I'm good.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.023
Of course.
Suit yourself.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.954
Your partner there
is a real hard-ass, huh?

17:19.442 --> 17:22.602
I had a supervisor
just like him at Border Patrol.

17:22.962 --> 17:24.626
He got off
on pushing buttons.

17:24.712 --> 17:27.357
He's my training officer,
and we're not discussing this.

17:27.442 --> 17:30.931
Hmm. I always forget
that you are a rookie.

17:31.376 --> 17:33.188
It must chap your ass

17:33.274 --> 17:35.187
to be bossed around
by a younger guy like that.

17:35.272 --> 17:37.373
Not at all. It's the only way
I'm gonna learn.

17:39.135 --> 17:40.660
I'm not buying it.

17:40.815 --> 17:42.120
Guy like that?

17:42.252 --> 17:45.417
Oh, man. He is all sorts
of superior.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.468
He probably thinks that
I smuggled people over the border

17:47.553 --> 17:48.850
for the money.

17:49.592 --> 17:53.667
I watched people die
every day,

17:53.752 --> 17:55.187
trying to
cross that border,

17:55.272 --> 17:57.107
desperate for a new life.

17:57.192 --> 17:59.256
And after
a few years of that...

17:59.547 --> 18:01.022
I couldn't
take it anymore.

18:01.108 --> 18:03.813
I decided to do something
and help them.

18:04.022 --> 18:06.417
And so, yeah,
I made some money,

18:06.502 --> 18:09.983
but there are people that
are alive today because of me.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.819
I had no idea you were
such a humanitarian.

18:13.062 --> 18:14.623
Thank you.

18:14.869 --> 18:17.224
What about the people you
smuggled out of the country...

18:17.380 --> 18:20.695
The, uh, cartel members,
fugitives from justice?

18:20.882 --> 18:23.553
Okay, yeah, that was
for the money, but...

18:29.631 --> 18:30.467
Hey, you.

18:30.553 --> 18:31.709
What are you wearing?

18:31.795 --> 18:34.264
I am at the safe house
right now.

18:34.350 --> 18:35.477
Did you meet my friend Sean?

18:35.562 --> 18:37.444
I did.
You dated a Navy SEAL?

18:37.530 --> 18:39.491
I'm gonna kill him.
Yes, I did.

18:39.577 --> 18:43.303
It was for about... two months,
right after my divorce.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.533
Was he Team Six?

18:44.619 --> 18:46.936
Are you asking if my
ex shot Bin Laden?

18:47.022 --> 18:49.647
Yeah, just in a..."thank you
for your service" kind of way.

18:49.733 --> 18:50.876
Got to go.

18:50.962 --> 18:52.242
Yeah, we'll keep it
locked down here.

18:52.327 --> 18:54.142
Let us know ASAP.

18:54.302 --> 18:56.357
D.A.'s office just discovered
a credible threat

18:56.442 --> 18:58.412
against our guy...
A cartel hit team.

18:58.498 --> 19:01.803
Trying to figure out if the safe
house has been compromised.

19:04.108 --> 19:06.423
Well, that looks
a little awkward.

19:06.743 --> 19:08.092
It sure does.

19:08.922 --> 19:09.998
Nurse's station.

19:10.084 --> 19:12.943
Gino, hey. I, um,
tried calling your cell.

19:13.029 --> 19:14.354
Yeah, I... I know.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.958
I didn't answer.

19:16.810 --> 19:18.333
Hello?

19:18.419 --> 19:20.044
Gino?

19:20.252 --> 19:21.547
He hung up.

19:21.632 --> 19:23.817
Why?
What did you do?

19:23.902 --> 19:24.917
Nothing.

19:25.003 --> 19:27.566
Um, do you mind if we stop
by the hospital after lunch?

19:27.732 --> 19:30.206
Not unless you get
food poisoning.

19:30.679 --> 19:32.910
Are they sending backup?
That's unclear.

19:32.996 --> 19:35.102
Sounded like they're scrambling
to assess the situation.

19:35.187 --> 19:36.566
Hey, guys.

19:36.783 --> 19:38.686
Something going on?
You seem stressed.

19:38.772 --> 19:39.972
Nothing.

19:40.058 --> 19:41.817
If there's a problem,
I deserve to know.

19:41.902 --> 19:43.477
It's my life
that's on the line.

19:43.562 --> 19:45.027
Sit your ass back down.

19:45.331 --> 19:47.640
Make me.

19:54.132 --> 19:56.766
Earthquake...
Get on the ground!

20:05.132 --> 20:07.817
Hey!
Everybody under your desks!

20:09.302 --> 20:11.187
Everybody down!

20:17.542 --> 20:18.817
It's an earthquake!

20:23.172 --> 20:24.882
Get down!

20:28.092 --> 20:30.337
Wade!

20:30.422 --> 20:31.462
Wade!

20:32.962 --> 20:35.267
Go! Come on!

20:38.882 --> 20:40.131
I got you.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.053
That was
a pretty good one.

20:48.592 --> 20:50.693
I'm gonna check the house, make
sure we're still five by five.

20:50.778 --> 20:51.966
Watch him.

20:54.542 --> 20:55.849
Never been through
an earthquake before.

20:55.934 --> 20:58.458
Yeah, they take some
getting used to.

20:59.112 --> 21:00.536
Um...

21:00.860 --> 21:02.528
are those guys
supposed to be here?

21:03.083 --> 21:05.091
Get away from there.

21:26.498 --> 21:27.853
Don't move!
Get down. Get down.

21:27.939 --> 21:30.030
Give me your hands.
Give me your hands!

21:30.507 --> 21:31.952
- What the hell is going on?
- Ow.

21:32.038 --> 21:33.272
Nothing I can't handle.

21:33.358 --> 21:34.543
- You alright?
- Yeah.

21:34.629 --> 21:35.854
Any word
on the hit squad?

21:35.940 --> 21:38.166
No. Radios are down.
Phone.

21:38.299 --> 21:39.753
We're on our own.

21:50.032 --> 21:51.376
Okay. Okay.

21:51.462 --> 21:53.165
Let's get you
to this table.

21:53.906 --> 21:55.462
Let's sit you down.

21:56.195 --> 21:58.641
- Good, good.
- Let me take a look.

21:58.727 --> 22:00.696
Alright. That's gonna need
a few stitches.

22:00.782 --> 22:02.507
This is not a priority.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.477
Hey, call out
if you're injured!

22:04.563 --> 22:06.571
- Me, Sarge.
- Hello? Hello?

22:06.657 --> 22:07.985
Land lines are down.

22:08.071 --> 22:10.524
7-Adam-100, status report.

22:10.817 --> 22:12.462
Hello? Hel...

22:12.548 --> 22:14.438
- So are the radios.
- Where's the captain?

22:14.524 --> 22:16.157
At a doctor's
appointment.

22:16.243 --> 22:17.587
Or maybe lunch by now.

22:17.673 --> 22:20.743
Everyone!
Everyone! Listen up!

22:21.265 --> 22:22.970
We trained for this.

22:23.087 --> 22:25.212
First priority is assessment.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.913
Lennox, Hall... sweep
the station for casualties.

22:27.999 --> 22:30.344
If anyone needs to go home
to check on your family,

22:30.430 --> 22:31.571
you're dismissed.

22:31.697 --> 22:33.882
We take care of our own.
Come back when you can.

22:33.968 --> 22:35.823
It's alright.
With comms down,

22:35.909 --> 22:38.804
we skip right to the old-school
part of the manual.

22:38.973 --> 22:41.813
This is a city
with people in crisis.

22:42.079 --> 22:44.003
We will serve them,
we will protect them,

22:44.089 --> 22:46.110
and we will make them safe,
understand?

22:46.196 --> 22:47.244
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

22:47.329 --> 22:49.073
Alright.
Let's go! Let's go!

22:58.754 --> 23:00.280
You're gonna need to
hold that to your face.

23:00.365 --> 23:01.421
Make sure
you're holding that up.

23:01.506 --> 23:04.330
Hey, keep this elevated.
Keep it up. Keep it up.

23:11.049 --> 23:12.714
Officers!
Can you help?

23:12.800 --> 23:15.274
Let's get out there.
He needs help.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.348
Calm down.
We'll get to you.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.436
I'm working as fast
as I can.

23:20.522 --> 23:22.717
Hey!
Hey, ladies and gentlemen!

23:22.803 --> 23:24.398
Ladies
and gentlemen, I need you to form

23:24.484 --> 23:27.404
a single-file line
in order of your arrival.

23:28.034 --> 23:29.779
Now, people! Right now!

23:29.865 --> 23:31.342
Single file.
Just line up right here.

23:31.428 --> 23:32.585
Yep.

23:32.671 --> 23:34.850
<i>Listen up, guys.
Settle down.</i>

23:35.340 --> 23:38.537
- Scalp lacerations.
- You can wait.

23:43.609 --> 23:45.451
- Stress fracture.
- You can wait.

23:45.568 --> 23:47.482
Gino? Gino.

23:48.451 --> 23:50.296
Just try to sit up.
Try to sit up.

23:50.382 --> 23:52.137
Hey, hey, hey.
Open your eyes.

23:52.276 --> 23:53.791
Hey! Hey!

23:53.877 --> 23:56.639
I need a trauma team!
Possible internal bleeding!

24:06.061 --> 24:08.306
Would it help
if I said I was sorry?

24:08.392 --> 24:10.077
I... I think
the earthquake set off

24:10.294 --> 24:12.189
my fight-or-flight response.
Save it.

24:12.274 --> 24:14.129
I can't get through to
the DA's office or the station.

24:14.214 --> 24:15.920
Radios are down.
Phone lines are overwhelmed.

24:16.005 --> 24:17.130
Get ready to move.

24:17.216 --> 24:18.612
We can't take a chance
this place has been compromised.

24:18.697 --> 24:21.032
That's dumb. Why would we
run around the city?

24:21.169 --> 24:22.630
There's no cover,
no concealment.

24:22.716 --> 24:25.231
I say we stay put from a...
A tactical standpoint.

24:25.317 --> 24:27.290
You don't get a vote.
You hit me in the head.

24:30.708 --> 24:32.053
No one else
in the house, right?

24:32.139 --> 24:34.173
If there is, shoot 'em.

24:55.313 --> 24:57.016
- We got to get out of here!
- Back door!

24:57.126 --> 24:58.322
What if there's
a gunman out there, too?

24:58.407 --> 25:00.129
Then you'll shoot him!
We're sitting ducks here.

25:00.214 --> 25:02.008
- Go!
- I'm not going anywhere!

25:02.109 --> 25:03.214
- Go.
- No.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.581
- Move!
- Aah.

25:38.993 --> 25:41.675
Come on. Come on.
Go. Go. Go. Go.

25:41.761 --> 25:43.173
Come on.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.395
- We need transportation.
- Well, in case you haven't noticed,

25:50.480 --> 25:52.225
there's a sniper
between us and our car.

25:52.311 --> 25:54.173
Hold here.
Head on a swivel.

25:54.259 --> 25:56.485
- This is stupid. We're sitting ducks.
- Shut up.

25:56.571 --> 25:57.876
You are in
way over your head.

25:57.962 --> 26:00.681
Says the guy being hunted
by the cartel hit squad.

26:06.561 --> 26:08.818
Nice car.
Inconspicuous.

26:08.904 --> 26:10.084
Get in the back.

26:10.318 --> 26:12.613
What's the plan?
Back to the station?

26:12.699 --> 26:14.385
No, that's where these guys
expect us to go.

26:14.470 --> 26:16.045
Safest thing
is to get lost.

26:16.131 --> 26:17.835
Go to the last place
they'd think to look for us.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.544
I know just the place.

26:26.633 --> 26:30.528
Yep, this is definitely
the last place I'd look for us.

26:34.118 --> 26:35.413
Ugh, ooh.

26:35.499 --> 26:37.006
I hate to be
that guy, but...

26:37.092 --> 26:38.646
I'm gonna need
some sunblock.

26:38.825 --> 26:40.217
I burn real easy.

26:40.357 --> 26:41.921
I don't have any, but I can
bury you up to your neck

26:42.006 --> 26:43.631
in the sand and put
a trash can on your head.

26:43.716 --> 26:45.006
I'm fine.

26:52.921 --> 26:56.115
- Ooh, I'm not putting that on.
- The wound is gonna leak.

26:56.201 --> 26:58.389
Do you want blood
running into your eye all day?

26:59.606 --> 27:02.201
- That's what I thought.
- Oh, my goodness.

27:02.506 --> 27:03.529
Yep.

27:05.961 --> 27:07.646
- Okay.
- Think we're good?

27:07.732 --> 27:08.709
Wait, wait.
Stay right there.

27:08.795 --> 27:09.928
One picture.
Just one.

27:10.014 --> 27:11.600
- Stop that.
- One. Just one.

27:11.686 --> 27:13.371
Alright, I'm... I'm ready.
Let's go.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.452
Alright.
Radio tower's down.

27:15.538 --> 27:18.433
ETA on repair
is at least an hour.

27:18.656 --> 27:20.361
Phone services are swamped.

27:20.498 --> 27:22.459
Only 20% of the calls
are getting through.

27:22.545 --> 27:27.107
So we're going to mark every
Priority One call on the map

27:27.193 --> 27:29.050
so we can all see
where the trouble spots are.

27:29.136 --> 27:31.511
Sir, captain called in
on my line with orders for you.

27:31.596 --> 27:32.967
Thank you.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.701
Our fearless leader wants me
to immediately dispatch a unit

27:42.787 --> 27:45.248
to Bel-Air
to guard against looters.

27:45.334 --> 27:47.685
And he also wants one
sent to his own block.

27:47.771 --> 27:50.028
Can you believe this guy?
There's no way I'm doing this.

27:50.114 --> 27:52.849
Oh, yes, you are.
He's the captain.

27:52.935 --> 27:56.864
Disobeying orders like that will
do nothing but get you fired.

28:09.715 --> 28:11.040
- Hey.
- Yeah?

28:11.126 --> 28:12.630
Sorry to interrupt.
How's he feeling?

28:12.716 --> 28:14.153
Uh, better.

28:14.239 --> 28:15.920
Thank you for saving him.

28:16.006 --> 28:18.781
Of course.
It's my job.

28:18.866 --> 28:20.511
What's gonna happen
to my mom?

28:20.935 --> 28:22.739
Is she going to jail?

28:23.868 --> 28:25.349
That's not my call.

28:25.482 --> 28:27.957
She's facing
serious charges,

28:28.149 --> 28:31.674
but her state of mind will be
taken into consideration.

28:31.846 --> 28:34.401
And if you can advocate
on her behalf,

28:34.486 --> 28:35.841
there's a chance
she could avoid prison

28:35.926 --> 28:37.661
and get the treatment
she needs.

28:38.990 --> 28:40.317
Thank you.

28:43.696 --> 28:47.458
<i>Control, 7-Adam-7,
show us on patrol in Bel-Air.</i>

28:47.544 --> 28:48.769
Still no word from Gino?

28:48.855 --> 28:52.670
Nothing.
What if he's hurt? Or worse.

28:52.827 --> 28:54.591
And the last thing
I said to him was in anger.

28:54.676 --> 28:56.071
Odds are he's fine.

28:56.156 --> 28:58.880
Quake wasn't that big,
and the hospital's retrofitted.

28:59.685 --> 29:01.380
This is a waste
of time and resources.

29:01.466 --> 29:03.662
The last thing people are gonna
do when the city's at a standstill

29:03.747 --> 29:05.786
is drive up to Bel-Air
and loot.

29:07.114 --> 29:08.825
Or maybe not.

29:22.178 --> 29:24.200
Front door's open.

29:28.327 --> 29:29.722
- Stay back!
- Gun!

29:31.156 --> 29:33.361
Come on!

29:33.446 --> 29:36.111
Come on!

29:36.312 --> 29:38.207
I'll kill you!

29:41.016 --> 29:42.355
He retreated inside!

29:42.441 --> 29:43.597
Let's go!

29:47.298 --> 29:48.772
Stay focused.

29:56.468 --> 29:59.290
Remember your training.
Keep it cool. Keep it tight.

30:15.548 --> 30:16.803
- Hands up!
- Don't shoot!

30:16.888 --> 30:18.868
- Come out of there!
- Weapon! Drop the gun!

30:18.977 --> 30:20.653
- It's only a BB gun.
- What the hell happened to you?

30:20.738 --> 30:22.343
My boss,
he's lost his mind.

30:22.428 --> 30:23.753
Who?
The fat guy in a kimono?

30:23.838 --> 30:25.423
Yeah. Tommy Lamont.
I'm his assistant.

30:25.508 --> 30:27.564
He was on day three of a coke
binge when the earthquake hit,

30:27.649 --> 30:29.267
and now he thinks
it's the end of the world.

30:29.352 --> 30:31.157
I'm still lost
on the welts.

30:31.372 --> 30:33.025
He had us hunting each other
throughout the house

30:33.110 --> 30:35.813
with BB guns to stay sharp
for the oncoming apocalypse.

30:35.909 --> 30:37.454
- You're kidding.
- I wish.

30:37.678 --> 30:40.290
But then when it hit,
he got into the gun cabinet,

30:40.376 --> 30:42.931
and I was terrified he would
forget which was which.

30:43.017 --> 30:44.376
Can you turn off
that alarm?

30:44.462 --> 30:45.485
Yes.

30:45.571 --> 30:47.163
Go do that,
then wait outside.

30:52.446 --> 30:54.035
On me.

31:04.178 --> 31:05.977
Jonah!

31:08.008 --> 31:09.757
Jonah!

31:18.857 --> 31:21.496
Mr. Lamont, LAPD!

31:22.039 --> 31:23.316
Mr. Lamont,

31:23.402 --> 31:25.207
I need you to stand
where I can see you

31:25.293 --> 31:26.868
and put your weapons
on the ground.

31:26.954 --> 31:28.349
I'm not falling
for that.

31:28.548 --> 31:30.753
I saw that episode
of "Midnight Apocalypse"

31:30.838 --> 31:32.593
where they steal
the police uniforms.

31:32.678 --> 31:33.843
This guy is
out of his mind.

31:33.928 --> 31:35.323
Sir, you're not
thinking straight.

31:35.408 --> 31:37.482
- We're here to help you.
- I don't believe you!

31:38.794 --> 31:39.980
It was just a BB.

31:40.066 --> 31:43.171
That alarm is eating
into my brain!

31:43.257 --> 31:45.132
Jonah's taking care
of that.

31:45.218 --> 31:46.273
What have you done
with Jonah?

31:46.358 --> 31:48.402
He's fine!
Jonah is fine.

31:48.551 --> 31:50.653
He's helping us.
Gonna take care of that alarm.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.894
Ah, you tricked him.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.652
He's helping you
steal my rations!

31:54.738 --> 31:55.963
Jonah!

31:56.048 --> 31:57.753
Don't listen to them!

31:57.838 --> 31:59.133
Don't trust them!

31:59.218 --> 32:01.233
We're gonna be here
all day.

32:03.147 --> 32:04.662
Mr. Lamont,
I'm gonna confide in you,

32:04.818 --> 32:06.803
but you
can't tell anyone.

32:06.888 --> 32:08.488
We have a place
all set up.

32:09.121 --> 32:11.941
A bunch of us survivors
are heading that way.

32:12.205 --> 32:14.730
Rations that can last for years,
solar power,

32:15.000 --> 32:19.574
but we need you to trust us
and set down your weapons.

32:27.468 --> 32:30.533
Turn around, and put your hands
on the back of your head.

32:30.618 --> 32:33.023
Get on your knees.

32:46.468 --> 32:48.337
Are you okay? Yeah.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.036
On the bright side,
we finally have a legit reason

32:50.121 --> 32:51.536
to go to
the hospital now.

32:51.730 --> 32:55.355
Jonah!
Call my lawyer.

33:00.443 --> 33:01.506
It would be a lot nicer

33:01.592 --> 33:02.939
- without these cuffs.
- Tough.

33:03.069 --> 33:05.235
Texts are back online.
It's from the ADA.

33:05.321 --> 33:06.783
The hit team
wasn't trying to kill Hayes...

33:06.868 --> 33:08.368
It was trying
to rescue him.

33:08.609 --> 33:09.982
You were in on it
the whole time?

33:10.068 --> 33:11.204
You set us up
to be killed.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.509
No.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.125
Well, yeah.

33:14.376 --> 33:15.733
As much as I love the idea

33:15.818 --> 33:18.517
of being a barista
in Armpit, Arizona,

33:18.603 --> 33:21.017
- I've got other plans.
- How did they know how to find you?

33:21.103 --> 33:23.767
You were sequestered.
No phone, no Internet.

33:23.950 --> 33:26.267
GPS tracker.
Son of a bitch.

33:26.407 --> 33:28.612
- That's not mine.
- We got to get out of here.

33:29.270 --> 33:30.493
Uh-oh.

33:46.442 --> 33:47.647
What do we do now?

33:47.733 --> 33:49.193
You guys should just
let me walk away.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.388
I mean, nobody gets hurt.

33:51.482 --> 33:53.017
Think how
you're gonna feel

33:53.298 --> 33:55.233
if another buddy gets killed
in the line of duty.

33:55.318 --> 33:56.963
Shut up.

33:57.048 --> 33:58.383
So what now?

33:58.468 --> 33:59.963
They can't afford
to kill Hayes,

34:00.048 --> 34:01.323
so they'll have to
come up here and get him.

34:01.408 --> 34:03.403
You do know
there's three of them, right?

34:03.488 --> 34:05.193
It's almost
a fair fight.

34:05.278 --> 34:06.822
Hook him up.

34:33.288 --> 34:34.460
Drop your guns
in the sand!

34:34.545 --> 34:36.231
- Get down on your stomachs now!
- No.

34:36.353 --> 34:38.757
Get down now!

34:40.969 --> 34:43.295
Hands behind your back.

34:46.063 --> 34:49.366
So I'm guessing my
immunity deal's out the window.

35:00.070 --> 35:02.585
Cafeteria
had snickerdoodles.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.833
Can't eat
before the surgery.

35:07.185 --> 35:11.030
Well, you can
have them after.

35:18.508 --> 35:20.749
I know you're
disappointed in me...

35:22.384 --> 35:24.624
...but you and Mom always
taught me to be true to myself.

35:24.724 --> 35:29.186
And... this job
it's...

35:29.624 --> 35:31.741
It's who I am.

35:32.314 --> 35:34.132
It makes me happy.

35:36.357 --> 35:38.952
You hate the system because
it's designed to punish people,

35:39.038 --> 35:40.092
not care for them,

35:40.178 --> 35:41.561
but that will never change

35:41.647 --> 35:44.811
unless people like me
step up and make it change.

35:49.586 --> 35:53.038
I heard you talking
to that patient down the hall.

35:53.837 --> 35:57.577
You were honest with him...
and kind.

35:58.745 --> 36:00.374
I was impressed.

36:02.708 --> 36:03.913
Dr. Chen?

36:04.013 --> 36:06.390
William.
I told you not to come.

36:06.771 --> 36:08.374
Dad, who's this?

36:08.477 --> 36:09.872
A friend.

36:09.973 --> 36:12.171
- You should go.
- I'm so sorry.

36:12.669 --> 36:14.452
I was...

36:16.062 --> 36:18.429
William, did you
assault my father?

36:18.684 --> 36:21.449
It was an accident.
I... I... I didn't...

36:21.534 --> 36:22.726
No, Lucy.

36:22.937 --> 36:24.179
Don't.

36:24.428 --> 36:26.999
N...
It'll devastate him!

36:27.327 --> 36:28.944
Destroy all the work
we've done.

36:29.030 --> 36:30.702
- I'm sorry.
- Let him go.

36:30.788 --> 36:33.183
I can't.
I don't have a choice.

36:35.561 --> 36:38.413
I will be right here
when you get out of surgery, okay?

36:38.499 --> 36:40.007
Don't bother.

36:46.215 --> 36:47.980
<i>♪ I can't hear you ♪</i>

36:48.066 --> 36:50.874
- Sorry, sorry.
- No, no. Don't be.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.443
- <i>♪ You're too far away ♪
- I deserve to be in a little pain</i>

36:53.528 --> 36:55.640
after overreacting
this morning.

36:56.944 --> 37:01.124
Just... my dad is a legend
in the LAPD.

37:01.210 --> 37:04.351
Half the people there think
I just got in on his name.

37:04.708 --> 37:07.819
Anything I do hits me twice
as hard as any other rookie.

37:08.076 --> 37:11.461
So I, um, just
try to keep my head down

37:11.547 --> 37:14.061
and make everything
about the work.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.351
- <i>♪ I can't love you ♪</i>
- I'm sorry.

37:17.445 --> 37:19.749
- <i>♪ How you want me to ♪</i>
- It's not easy.

37:19.835 --> 37:24.288
No, what's not easy
is admitting how freaked I was

37:24.374 --> 37:27.327
when I couldn't get ahold
of you after the earthquake.

37:28.826 --> 37:32.694
I'm sorry for being
such an idiot earlier.

37:35.186 --> 37:36.516
Do over?

37:38.451 --> 37:40.015
Do over.

37:43.532 --> 37:45.577
- So I guess it's our bad.
- Your "bad"?

37:45.663 --> 37:47.391
Your guys were supposed to
give Hayes a thorough pat-down

37:47.476 --> 37:48.594
before bringing him
to the safe house.

37:48.679 --> 37:49.734
How the hell did they
miss a tracking device?

37:49.819 --> 37:51.693
Well, they didn't.
The deputy who patted him down

37:51.778 --> 37:53.570
confessed to slipping Hayes
the tracking chip.

37:53.655 --> 37:55.090
He's in custody now,
too.

37:55.176 --> 37:56.359
So what's gonna happen
to Hayes?

37:56.444 --> 37:58.546
Well, he's facing
a half a dozen new charges,

37:58.632 --> 38:00.164
including two counts
of attempted murder.

38:00.249 --> 38:01.655
He'll do 20 years,
easy.

38:01.741 --> 38:03.632
That's if
he still cooperates.

38:05.983 --> 38:08.515
Officer Chen.
Booking report is only three pages.

38:08.601 --> 38:12.096
- Why do you have five?
- Um... I thought this arrest warranted

38:12.182 --> 38:14.069
a mental health
report addendum.

38:14.476 --> 38:16.302
The perpetrator shattered
your father's arm.

38:16.388 --> 38:17.653
Are you sure you're not
trying to get back

38:17.738 --> 38:18.991
into your dad's
good graces?

38:19.077 --> 38:21.242
I'm pretty sure
that's impossible,

38:21.328 --> 38:23.132
but, um, he's not wrong.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.823
This guy needs help,
not prison,

38:24.908 --> 38:28.483
so I'm gonna do what I can
to help get that for him.

38:28.944 --> 38:30.390
Good.

38:31.038 --> 38:32.327
Wait.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.351
Was that a test?

38:36.263 --> 38:38.898
What, you think Bradford has
a monopoly on 'em?

38:43.428 --> 38:44.913
Thanks for the assist today.

38:44.999 --> 38:46.164
Oh, are you
kidding me?

38:46.250 --> 38:48.827
- That was fun being back in crisis mode.
- Sergeant Grey!

38:50.533 --> 38:51.998
Yes, sir?

38:52.239 --> 38:53.794
I just got off the phone
with my wife.

38:53.973 --> 38:56.140
The patrol that you
assigned to my neighbor...

38:56.371 --> 38:57.772
never showed up.

38:58.630 --> 39:00.319
That's my fault, sir.

39:00.765 --> 39:04.060
I rerouted the officers
to assist a traffic collision.

39:04.256 --> 39:05.651
If you want to
file a complaint,

39:05.737 --> 39:07.640
you'd be well within
your rights to do so.

39:07.875 --> 39:11.171
I would... if I were
remaining in command here.

39:11.772 --> 39:13.686
I've just been promoted
to headquarters.

39:13.783 --> 39:15.663
Good luck with
your next captain.

39:16.264 --> 39:18.585
Oh, good luck
to you, sir.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.905
How the hell
did that guy get promoted?

39:23.991 --> 39:25.530
Made a few phone calls.

39:25.623 --> 39:27.538
Sang his praises
downtown.

39:27.638 --> 39:31.116
I told them how he
single-handedly saved the city.

39:31.436 --> 39:33.258
Doesn't it bother you
that he's going to take credit

39:33.343 --> 39:35.186
for everything
that you did today?

39:39.812 --> 39:42.866
No.
The people who matter know.

39:43.401 --> 39:46.335
<i>♪ How you want me to ♪</i>

39:48.171 --> 39:50.436
So how'd you like
your first earthquake?

39:50.661 --> 39:52.577
It was terrifying.

39:53.421 --> 39:54.452
Well, just wait

39:54.538 --> 39:56.358
- until the big one hits.
- Oh.

39:57.555 --> 39:59.491
Sean texted me
about you.

40:00.427 --> 40:03.007
It looks like
you made a fan.

40:03.310 --> 40:05.205
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

40:05.319 --> 40:06.327
And I wouldn't have

40:06.413 --> 40:08.086
had you not told me
about that opportunity,

40:08.171 --> 40:09.897
- so thank you very much.
- Mm.

40:10.407 --> 40:13.362
I'm sorry that you...
almost got killed.

40:13.448 --> 40:15.017
- I know, right?
- Oh.

40:21.780 --> 40:23.947
Is... everything okay?

40:24.033 --> 40:25.468
Y-Yeah.

40:27.098 --> 40:28.777
Was there a reason
you didn't tell Sean

40:28.863 --> 40:30.152
about me being a rookie?

40:30.238 --> 40:33.113
I didn't know
that I was supposed to.

40:33.238 --> 40:34.733
It bothers you?

40:34.818 --> 40:37.129
No, no.
It's just...

40:37.949 --> 40:39.809
You're a very
impressive woman.

40:39.959 --> 40:41.746
Very. It's...

40:42.082 --> 40:44.488
the least impressive thing
about you

40:44.574 --> 40:47.777
is you're
dating a 45-year-old rookie.

40:49.967 --> 40:51.777
That's ridiculous.

40:52.658 --> 40:54.254
Look, I...

40:54.928 --> 40:56.574
I like you.

40:57.279 --> 40:59.176
You like me.

40:59.985 --> 41:02.137
You're not always
gonna be a rookie,

41:02.223 --> 41:07.543
and I will always be
this amazing, so...

41:07.884 --> 41:10.457
Why?
What's wrong with that?

41:16.904 --> 41:18.371
Nothing.
