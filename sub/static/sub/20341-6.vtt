10:40.875 --> 10:43.875
-Quick!
-I can get you up there quick!
Hop on!

10:43.875 --> 10:45.583
We're comin', Bingo!

10:45.583 --> 10:46.958
Hurry!

10:46.958 --> 10:49.000
This is how I jump,
this is how I jump,

10:49.000 --> 10:52.333
this is how I jump,
this is how I jump!

10:52.333 --> 10:53.875
Go, Whaley, go!

10:54.875 --> 10:55.875
Help!

10:58.833 --> 11:00.208
I've got you!

11:01.208 --> 11:03.458
That was amazing!

11:03.458 --> 11:07.750
♪ Like you flew
but without any wings,
look at you ♪

11:07.750 --> 11:09.208
Bow to the wow!

11:09.208 --> 11:12.000
-You did it!
-Yeah, that was a whale
of a jump!

11:12.000 --> 11:15.291
Huhh! Ohh, I made it
all the way...

11:15.291 --> 11:16.875
to the other side!

11:16.875 --> 11:19.375
Out into where the big ocean is!

11:19.375 --> 11:22.416
-(voice howling)
-Bingo, do you hear that?

11:22.416 --> 11:24.708
I heard that for sure!

11:24.708 --> 11:25.750
It sounded like...

11:27.500 --> 11:28.583
Mom!

11:30.500 --> 11:32.875
Look at what I learned
how to do!

11:37.500 --> 11:41.958
-I like seein'
those two bein' so happy.
-Yeah, watchin' whales is fun!

11:42.958 --> 11:46.875
Look at those whalies jump.
Jump, pretty whalies, jump!

11:46.875 --> 11:49.000
(laughs)
Yippity-dog!

11:49.000 --> 11:52.750
Oh, I've got to get a picture!

11:52.750 --> 11:55.875
And here's a picture I took
of two whales jumping out
of the water.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.458
(dogs barking)

11:57.458 --> 11:59.708
You know, next time
I go whale watching,

11:59.708 --> 12:03.291
I should take you guys
with me, so you can see
a whale up close.

12:03.291 --> 12:06.375
I would love to go with Bob
on a boat to watch whales.

12:06.375 --> 12:09.583
Or, we could take him with us
on a whale to watch people!

12:09.583 --> 12:10.708
(laughs)

12:10.708 --> 12:11.833
Rolly...

12:16.875 --> 12:18.333
(Bingo and Rolly speak)

12:20.291 --> 12:24.083
Watch where you step, Rolly.
You don't wanna fall
into the boiling hot lava!

12:24.083 --> 12:26.000
I'll be extra careful!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.708
Whoaaa!

12:27.708 --> 12:28.875
What's goin' on?

12:28.875 --> 12:30.708
We're pretending the grass
is hot lava.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.166
And, you're standing
in hot lava!

12:33.166 --> 12:35.708
Oh. Ow. Ouch.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.083
Owee. Ow.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.333
Hey, there, puppy dog players!

12:39.333 --> 12:40.875
-It's Bob!
-Hey, Bob!

12:40.875 --> 12:43.083
Who's ready
for a unicycle day?

12:43.083 --> 12:45.000
(laughs)
I know I am!

12:45.000 --> 12:48.458
You know, I tried
unicycling before,
but it didn't go so well,

12:48.458 --> 12:51.083
so I read this book
about how to do it,

12:51.083 --> 12:53.500
and I'm gonna give it
another try.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.833
Just gotta remember
where I put that
one-wheeled thing.

12:56.833 --> 12:58.708
Let's see.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.416
Here's my bicycle.

13:00.416 --> 13:03.583
Hmm. Where's
my unicycle?

13:03.583 --> 13:06.500
I remember the last time
Bob tried to ride that unicycle.

13:08.125 --> 13:12.000
Hey, guys!
Look what I just got!
A unicycle!

13:12.000 --> 13:13.708
-Cool!
-Hey, let me see!

13:13.708 --> 13:17.875
I've never ridden one
of these before, but you guys
get to watch me try.

13:19.375 --> 13:20.458
Ooh...

13:20.458 --> 13:21.750
Wh-- Wh-- Whoa!

13:21.750 --> 13:23.000
Whoa!

13:23.000 --> 13:24.750
Oh! Check it out!

13:24.750 --> 13:28.166
I'm doin' it!
I'm-- Whoa-- Whoa!

13:28.166 --> 13:29.875
-Oh!
-Are you okay?

13:29.875 --> 13:33.000
Uh, where did Bob go?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.083
Huh... what was I thinking?

13:35.083 --> 13:38.000
Trying to ride something
with only one wheel!

13:38.000 --> 13:41.416
I don't ever wanna see
that silly unicycle again!

13:43.458 --> 13:46.625
Yeah. Bob said he didn't
wanna see that unicycle again.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.208
But now he does
wanna see it again.

13:49.208 --> 13:53.083
Maybe I can find my unicycle
after I get home from work.

13:53.083 --> 13:57.083
Then I can ride it around
and say, "Look! I'm
riding a unicycle!"

13:57.083 --> 14:00.375
Ha! See you later, puppy-nators!

14:00.375 --> 14:02.708
I remember what happened
to that unicycle.

14:02.708 --> 14:05.250
After Bob said he didn't
wanna see it again,
we buried it

14:05.250 --> 14:06.500
so it'd never
have to be seen.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.708
Then all we have to do
is dig it back up.

14:08.708 --> 14:10.875
Except I don't remember
where we buried it.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.083
Uh, me neither.

14:12.083 --> 14:15.125
So it's gonna be
our mission to find out
where it is. Come on!

14:15.125 --> 14:17.416

14:59.000 --> 15:00.833
where we buried
Bob's unicycle?

15:00.833 --> 15:02.458
We should check
with Cagey.

15:02.458 --> 15:05.166
He sees everything
out the window of the pet store
where he lives.

15:05.166 --> 15:07.750
Maybe he'll remember
seeing us on the day
that we buried it.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.000
On the day you buried what?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.708
Leave us alone, Cupcake.

15:11.708 --> 15:14.166
We're on a mission
to find Bob's unicycle.

15:14.166 --> 15:17.458
I don't know what I'd do
with a unicycle.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.250
But if those puppies
want it, I want it!

15:20.250 --> 15:23.166
-So, come help me
get what I want!
-Huh? (chuckles)

15:25.500 --> 15:27.625
Sure, I remember that day.

15:27.625 --> 15:31.083
It was the same day
I got this new exercise wheel,

15:31.083 --> 15:33.875
and I was takin' it
for a spin.

15:33.875 --> 15:37.166
And I've been spinning
ever since!

15:37.166 --> 15:39.166
Do you remember
where Rolly and I
were going?

15:39.166 --> 15:41.833
You said you were on your way
to bury something at the park.

15:41.833 --> 15:45.208
(gasp)
The park! We must've
buried the unicycle at the park!

15:45.208 --> 15:49.208
Well, you guys
should run there real fast,
like this!

15:49.208 --> 15:50.625
No, no!

15:50.625 --> 15:53.708
(out of breath)
Maybe not...
quite so fast, ha.

15:53.708 --> 15:55.125
Thanks for the help, Cagey.

15:55.125 --> 15:58.125
Come on, Rolly!
Let's run!

15:58.125 --> 16:00.125
How are we gonna figure out
where to start digging?

16:00.125 --> 16:03.208
We just need to concentrate
and think about nothing
other than--

16:03.208 --> 16:05.000
Look! A bee!

16:05.000 --> 16:06.166
Rolly, get back here!

16:06.166 --> 16:09.250
We're supposed
to be on a mission!

16:09.250 --> 16:13.125
I've got you now,
you honey-loving, buzzy
little buzz-ball!

16:18.500 --> 16:21.583
(buzzing)

16:21.583 --> 16:23.166
Huh?

16:23.166 --> 16:24.583
Aw, buzz, it got away.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.208
Except, that flower
reminds me.

16:27.208 --> 16:31.333
I think we might've
buried Bob's unicycle
next to a blue flower!

16:31.333 --> 16:32.750
That blue flower!

16:34.875 --> 16:37.208
Do you think Bob's unicycle
is down here?

16:37.208 --> 16:39.375
Well, something's down here.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.416
(grunting)

16:41.416 --> 16:43.375
Bingo, look!
It's--

16:43.375 --> 16:45.208
Not a unicycle.

16:45.208 --> 16:46.416
It's just a metal stick.

16:46.416 --> 16:48.583
Can we take it home
and play fetch with it later?

16:48.583 --> 16:50.416
(chewing on it)

16:50.416 --> 16:51.833
Kinda indestructible.

16:51.833 --> 16:52.958
I guess we might as well.

16:52.958 --> 16:55.250
-Hey, guys!
-Hey, Jackie!

16:55.250 --> 16:56.833
This is a really nice hole.

16:56.833 --> 16:58.625
Thanks, we dug it ourselves.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.083
Are you burying something?

17:00.083 --> 17:01.291
Do you need any help?

17:01.291 --> 17:03.708
We were actually
trying to unbury something.

17:03.708 --> 17:07.208
But what we found
isn't the right something
we came here to dig up.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.500
I remember a while back
when you guys were here,

17:09.500 --> 17:12.333
you said you were on your way
to the beach to bury something,

17:12.333 --> 17:13.625
but I never saw what it was.

17:13.625 --> 17:16.375
So maybe that's
where we buried
Bob's unicycle.

17:16.375 --> 17:17.875
Thanks, Jackie!

17:17.875 --> 17:20.750
Have fun with your unburying!

17:20.750 --> 17:24.291
Follow those pups!

17:24.291 --> 17:26.291
How deep do we gotta go?

17:26.291 --> 17:28.250
As deep as it takes
to finish our mission.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.250

Hey, Jonathan!
We're lookin'
for Bob's unicycle!

17:37.083 --> 17:38.375
Uh, mind if I watch?

17:38.375 --> 17:43.000
I-- I don't have TV
in my nest, but this
looks like a pretty good show.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.750
I don't think there's anything
down here.

17:44.750 --> 17:47.333
There isn't.
But if you're lookin'
for what you buried that day,

17:47.333 --> 17:51.416
I remember you buryin'
somethin', you should be
diggin' over there!

17:51.416 --> 17:53.208
If you remembered
where we buried something,

17:53.208 --> 17:55.291
why didn't you tell us
where we buried it?

17:55.291 --> 17:56.750
Well, 'cause you never asked!

18:00.166 --> 18:02.833
Rolly! I think there's
something down here!

18:02.833 --> 18:06.000
Huh... that's not a unicycle
at all.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.250
It kinda looks like
a seashell.

18:08.250 --> 18:11.333
Listen to those waves.
It sounds like I'm right
at the beach.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.708
I don't think it's a seashell.

18:12.708 --> 18:15.416
But I think it might be a hat.

18:15.416 --> 18:16.750
How do I look?

18:16.750 --> 18:18.375
Like a dog wearing a hat?

18:18.375 --> 18:20.958
-Nice.
-Well, we're supposed
to be two dogs

18:20.958 --> 18:22.250
finding Bob's unicycle.

18:22.250 --> 18:23.708
Well, I don't know
if this helps,

18:23.708 --> 18:26.458
but that day you were here,
when you left, you said

18:26.458 --> 18:28.375
you were going
to see another friend.

18:28.375 --> 18:31.583
That does help!
Because I just remembered
where we were going!

18:31.583 --> 18:35.000

18:35.000 --> 18:36.458
Thanks
for the help, Jonathan.

18:36.458 --> 18:38.458
Oops!
I almost forgot this!

18:41.333 --> 18:43.583
And now they're going
to another place?

18:43.583 --> 18:46.708
I wish those puppies
would make up their minds.

18:46.708 --> 18:51.416
Sure, I remember that day.
You came here to bury somethin'.

18:51.416 --> 18:53.833
Do you remember
where we buried it, Bullworth?

18:53.833 --> 18:57.166
Hey, this junkyard dog
remembers everything.

18:57.166 --> 18:59.333
I got a mind like a steel trap.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.833
And also, a pile
of old steel traps.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.875
So be careful where you step.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.416
But let's see...

19:05.416 --> 19:06.708
Uhhh...

19:06.708 --> 19:09.750
There it is!
Whatever you were buryin',

19:09.750 --> 19:11.416
you buried it right there.

19:11.416 --> 19:14.166
How could we have buried
something underneath
this mountain?

19:14.166 --> 19:17.125
Because the mountain
wasn't there until they
put those plastic bottles there

19:17.125 --> 19:18.875
this mornin'.
They're takin' 'em away

19:18.875 --> 19:20.416
to recycle 'em
tomorrow afternoon.

19:20.416 --> 19:23.083
But Bob wants
to ride his unicycle today.

19:23.083 --> 19:25.208
Which means we've gotta
clear away that mountain

19:25.208 --> 19:27.458
before we can dig
and see if it's under there!

19:27.458 --> 19:30.166
This looks like a job
for Bingo and Rolly!

20:26.125 --> 20:28.458
Then there's only one thing
left to do.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.458
(shouts)

20:30.458 --> 20:32.583
(bottles falling)

20:32.583 --> 20:35.166
And that is how a doggie
does that!

20:35.166 --> 20:37.500
Great job, Rolly!
Now we can start digging,

20:37.500 --> 20:40.125
and see if we buried
Bob's unicycle here!

20:41.375 --> 20:43.833
-Is this it?
-I think it might be!

20:43.833 --> 20:45.125
Rolly! It's--

20:47.500 --> 20:49.125
Not a unicycle.

20:49.125 --> 20:51.833
Yeah, just some
round thingamajig.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.416
Although it rolls pretty well
for just being a thingamajig.

20:54.416 --> 20:55.833
Could we take it home
to play with?

20:55.833 --> 20:57.583
I guess so,
cause it doesn't

20:57.583 --> 20:59.708
look like we're gonna
find Bob's unicycle,

20:59.708 --> 21:02.291
so we might as well
take home something.

21:02.291 --> 21:05.333
Come on, thingamajig.
Let's roll you on outta here.

21:05.333 --> 21:06.458
Thanks, Bullworth!

21:06.458 --> 21:09.125
I sometimes wonder
if I was ever that young.

21:10.833 --> 21:12.416
Cupcake:
Stop right there!

21:12.416 --> 21:14.083
Oww!

21:14.083 --> 21:17.583
I thought you were supposed
to be digging up a unicycle?

21:17.583 --> 21:20.583
We thought so, too.
But all we found was a hat,

21:20.583 --> 21:22.583
and a metal stick,
and a thingamajig.

21:22.583 --> 21:23.875
(sniffing)

21:23.875 --> 21:27.500
And what am I gonna do
with a hat and a metal stick
and a thingamajig?

21:27.500 --> 21:28.958
What a waste of a day,

21:28.958 --> 21:31.250
sneaking around
after the two of you.

21:31.250 --> 21:35.583
Come on, Rufus.
Let's go sneak around
after someone else.

21:38.458 --> 21:40.583
Did you find Bob's unicycle?

21:40.583 --> 21:43.833
No. All we dug up was this.

21:43.833 --> 21:47.250
We really wanted
to find what Bob wanted,
but we didn't do it.

21:47.250 --> 21:51.875
Well, maybe you won't feel
so sad if you get your feet
out of the...

21:51.875 --> 21:53.875
hot lava!
Ow! Ooh! Ow!

21:53.875 --> 21:56.458
Hot hot hot hot hot!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ouch!

21:56.458 --> 21:57.750
It's not hot lava, Hissy,

21:57.750 --> 21:59.833
but thanks for tryin'
to make us feel better.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.458
Oh, right.

22:01.458 --> 22:03.583
-Hey, there, puppies!
-(dogs barking)

22:03.583 --> 22:06.291
Ah, I've been lookin' forward
to seein' you two all day.

22:06.291 --> 22:09.583
And look at that!
You found my unicycle!

22:09.583 --> 22:11.333
We did?

22:11.333 --> 22:15.875
Let's see, this goes
in here, and these things
stick onto that.

22:15.875 --> 22:19.083
-Uh, what's he doin'
with that stuff?
-I don't know.

22:19.083 --> 22:21.333
But he seems really excited
to be doing it.

22:21.333 --> 22:23.458
And the seat goes right on top.

22:23.458 --> 22:27.208
My unicycle!
Huh! As good as new!

22:27.208 --> 22:30.583
We dug it up in pieces
because we buried it
in pieces?

22:30.583 --> 22:33.000
Yeah! 'Cause I just
remembered something else

22:33.000 --> 22:34.625
about the day
when we buried it.

22:36.416 --> 22:38.500
Bingo:
After Bob fell off his unicycle

22:38.500 --> 22:40.708
he walked right past us
on the way outta the yard.

22:40.708 --> 22:44.083
I don't ever wanna see
that silly unicycle again!

22:44.083 --> 22:45.875
What should we do
with all the pieces
of the unicycle

22:45.875 --> 22:47.833
that Bob never wants
to see again?

22:47.833 --> 22:50.000
We should bury 'em...
in different places,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.458
so he'll absolutely for sure
never see them again!

22:52.458 --> 22:54.083
That's a great idea!

22:54.083 --> 22:55.708
I know we're getting rid
of almost all of it,

22:55.708 --> 22:57.708
but can we keep these blocks?

22:57.708 --> 23:00.083
Yeah! They'll be perfect
for when we play hot lava!

23:01.583 --> 23:03.375
All right, here I go!

23:03.375 --> 23:04.500
Wish me luck!

23:04.500 --> 23:06.500
Let's see if I can do it right
this time!

23:06.500 --> 23:09.416
Uh, oh, hey,
hey, look at this!

23:09.416 --> 23:11.583
I'm-- I'm doin' it right
this time!

23:11.583 --> 23:13.625
Oh! Whoaaa!

23:13.625 --> 23:15.583
Whoa, hey, this is fun!

23:15.583 --> 23:16.708
(laughs)

23:16.708 --> 23:18.166
Whoa!

23:18.166 --> 23:20.625
-We should tell Bob to look out.
-Look out for what?

23:20.625 --> 23:22.708
He's riding in hot lava!

23:22.708 --> 23:26.583
(dogs barking)

23:26.583 --> 23:28.458
(all laughing)

23:32.291 --> 23:35.708
(theme music playing)

23:35.708 --> 23:36.958
Both:
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:40.875 --> 23:42.000
Bark!
Bark! Bark!

23:43.500 --> 23:45.875
(record scratching)

23:52.375 --> 23:53.375
Bark!

23:56.625 --> 23:57.875
Bark!
Bark! Bark!
