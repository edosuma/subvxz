00:23.533 --> 00:25.933
-I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

-Crawl out!

Hold it! Hold it!

-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:42.400
in a court of law.

00:42.433 --> 00:46.233
-We're members of Glendale
Police Department's Neighborhood
Response Squad.

00:46.267 --> 00:48.333
We're a proactive patrol unit.

00:48.367 --> 00:50.867
We focus mainly
on community issues.

00:50.900 --> 00:53.000
Before I joined Glendale
Police Department,

00:53.033 --> 00:55.867
I did four years
in Arizona Department
of Corrections.

00:55.900 --> 00:59.667
I'd say I enjoy bein' out here
more than I enjoyed bein' inside

00:59.700 --> 01:01.667
of, uh, Corrections.

01:01.700 --> 01:03.933
-Uh, we see a white truck
up here off to the side

01:03.967 --> 01:05.267
of the road.
It looks like it's occupied

01:05.300 --> 01:07.400
by an individual.
Uh, it's all darked out,

01:07.433 --> 01:08.933
looks a little bit suspicious.

01:08.967 --> 01:10.533
-Got no plate.
-No plate?

01:10.567 --> 01:12.633
-No plate.
-We noticed that it didn't
have a plate on it,

01:12.667 --> 01:15.267
so we're gonna just try
and go make contact
with the guy.

01:24.067 --> 01:27.667
-What's goin' on, man?
-Man, look underneath
this thing,

01:27.700 --> 01:30.400
I'm tellin' you,
look, it's a trip.

01:30.433 --> 01:34.500
Look underneath this thing,
I've been-- I've been
trippin' out.

01:34.533 --> 01:37.067
Because I just bought
this vehicle...
-Yeah?

01:37.067 --> 01:40.500
-right? About two weeks ago.
I-- I got the temp tag.
-Turn the engine off.

01:40.533 --> 01:44.467
-It's my vehicle.
That's my name, no warrants,
no wants, nothin'.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.067
-That's always nice.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.933
-Everything's
all legit, officer.

01:49.967 --> 01:52.467
-Where do you live at?
-I'm transient at the moment.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.500
I kinda stay here and there.

01:54.533 --> 01:55.967
Friends' houses.
You know, families.

01:56.067 --> 01:58.300
-Have you ever been arrested?
Been arrested?

01:58.333 --> 02:00.400
-Have I been arrested?
Yeah, I've been arrested before.

02:00.433 --> 02:02.567
-What have you been
arrested for?

02:02.600 --> 02:05.867
-Well... what do you mean?

02:05.900 --> 02:08.567
-What have you gone--
What have you gone
to jail for?

02:08.600 --> 02:11.500
-Oh, yeah, I-- I--
I've been to prison.

02:11.533 --> 02:13.333
-Okay, what did you
go to prison for, then?

02:13.367 --> 02:18.833
-Um, criminal damage.
Uh, well, a class three,
a class four, and a class six.

02:18.867 --> 02:22.867
-Class three...
-I had burglary, criminal damage
and theft.

02:22.900 --> 02:26.300
But I've been trying
to keep my nose clean
and clear.

02:26.333 --> 02:29.467
-You don't have any weapons
or anything on you right now?

02:29.500 --> 02:35.400
On you, in the car?
-Honestly, I'm just-- I'm just
waitin' for a friend of mine,

02:35.433 --> 02:37.133
to--
-Okay. You don't have
anything illegal on--

02:37.167 --> 02:39.600
You don't have anything
illegal on you at the moment?

02:39.633 --> 02:43.233
-I'm... I mean--
-Two simple questions.

02:43.267 --> 02:46.700
Any weapons?
Or anything that you
shouldn't have in the car?

02:46.733 --> 02:48.367
-Could you step out?
-For what?

02:48.400 --> 02:50.267
-Make sure you don't
have any weapons on you.

02:50.300 --> 02:54.667
-Why, I'm not--
I'm in the clear,
I'm not being detained,

02:54.700 --> 02:57.067
I'm...
-Well, right now,
you're still-- you're still

02:57.067 --> 02:58.800
being detained in reference
to traffic stop.

02:58.833 --> 03:01.700
-Okay, but...
-And that's why I'm asking you.

03:01.733 --> 03:03.800
-why, uh...
-Okay, this-- this is
what we do.

03:03.833 --> 03:07.800
We're with the Neighborhood
Response Squad.
Our-- Our job is

03:07.833 --> 03:12.267
to focus on street level
narcotics, gangs, any type
of problems

03:12.300 --> 03:14.767
within the neighbor--
So, step out of the car.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.700
-I'm-- I'm not operating
the vehicle at the moment.

03:16.733 --> 03:19.633
-Do you have your insurance?
-Yes. All insurance.
I'm in the process--

03:19.667 --> 03:23.067
-Do you have
your insurance card on you?
-I need to get...

03:23.067 --> 03:25.933
I need to get--
That's why I have
a temp tag.

03:25.967 --> 03:27.100
That expires today.

03:27.133 --> 03:29.133
-Okay.
-I haven't been driving
the vehicle.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.300
I'm not a mechanic, sir.
-Okay.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.433
-My-- My whole thing is...
-Step outta the car for me.

03:33.467 --> 03:35.700
-sir...
-Step outta the car for me.

03:35.733 --> 03:38.333
-Call your sergeant, please.
-Step outta the car for me.

03:38.367 --> 03:40.067
Come on.
-Can you call the sergeant?

03:40.067 --> 03:42.700
-If there's, like,
a gun or a knife--
Don't reach for it...

03:42.733 --> 03:46.133
-No, now hold up, man.
This is bull(bleep).

03:46.167 --> 03:47.733
-Hit me!
-Step outta the car.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.300
-Hold on-- I'm stepping out!
-Don't pull away.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.600
-Step, step...
-Drop that cigarette.

03:50.633 --> 03:52.533
-Sir. Sir.
-He's tryin' to grab
for somethin'.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.333
He's got a pocket knife.
-Sir-- Sir-- No!

03:54.367 --> 03:56.800
All right! All right! Stop!
-Small knife.

03:56.833 --> 03:59.567
-Stop! It's harassment!
-There's something else.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.200
-(grunts)
-Oww!

04:02.233 --> 04:06.600
Oww!
I'm not doing--
There's nothing in my hand!

04:06.633 --> 04:09.900
Get off me,
I'm not doing anything, man!

04:09.933 --> 04:11.500
Oh! Please!

04:11.533 --> 04:13.300
-We were being nice.
-I don't wanna die, man.

04:13.333 --> 04:16.867
-Why would you die?
I didn't say you were
gonna die.

04:16.900 --> 04:18.767
-You're gonna kill me, man.
-Just relax.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.633
I don't understand
why you guys are harassing me.

04:21.667 --> 04:24.733
-Relax.
-He's got the small knife
that's angled.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.200
Plus, uh, brass knuckles.

04:26.233 --> 04:29.100
-Get ready,
stand up, all right?
-Self-defense.

04:29.133 --> 04:30.933
-Those are the kinds of things
that we wanna know.

04:30.967 --> 04:33.767
-What I was nervous about...
-Come on. Stand up.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.233
Stand up.
-We're not here to mess
with people.

04:36.267 --> 04:39.467
This trailer park
has a history of drugs,
people causing burglaries,

04:39.500 --> 04:41.767
all right?
You're parked
right in front of it.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.067
We're here to find out
what's going on.
All you had to do was listen.

04:44.067 --> 04:47.600
-I was listening, officer,
I was just on my...

04:47.633 --> 04:50.767
-When I ask you if you have
any weapons, and you start
gettin' nervous with me--

04:50.800 --> 04:53.533
-I was just
questioning you, Officer.
-Now you're gonna go to jail.

04:53.567 --> 04:55.467
-What?
-For resisting.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.067
-I wasn't--
-Obstructing.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.600
-Officer, I wasn't-- I was--
-Come on.

04:58.633 --> 05:01.067
-Listen...
-We're gonna go to the back
of the car, out of the street.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.800
-We're gonna talk to you
in just a few seconds, okay?
But I need you to just relax...

05:03.833 --> 05:05.967
-Come here.
-I know. You and I will talk
in a few minutes,

05:06.067 --> 05:07.433
but I need you to relax
for me, okay?

05:07.467 --> 05:10.167
We had a knife
and some brass knuckles
come outta your pocket.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.433
-We're gonna go right here.
Come on. Out of the street.

05:12.467 --> 05:14.900
-Is there anything else
in that vehicle that we need
to be concerned about?

05:14.933 --> 05:17.067
-No, sir.
-Thank you.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.467
Justin, right now
you're under arrest
for resisting.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.900
I asked you
two simple questions:
Any weapons?

05:21.933 --> 05:23.667
Or anything that you
shouldn't have in the car?

05:23.700 --> 05:25.667
Simple answer is,
"Yes, sir, I have
a pocket knife.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.133
I have a pair
of brass knuckles."

05:27.167 --> 05:29.700
Two simple answers, right?
But when you start
gettin' hesitant,

05:29.733 --> 05:31.700
start tryin' to figure out
a way outta things,

05:31.733 --> 05:35.067
like you were...
-It's... I understand.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.200
-Then I understand
that there's something else
going on.

05:37.233 --> 05:39.700
-There's--
-So for my safety,
I'm gonna get you away

05:39.733 --> 05:41.233
from whatever's
inside that cab.

05:41.267 --> 05:43.333
I don' t know if it's on you
or-- or if it's inside the cab.

05:43.367 --> 05:46.567
-Officer, you've searched
my whole truck.
-Justin, lis-- listen to me.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.833
That's why I asked you
outta the car.
-Okay.

05:48.867 --> 05:51.733
-I asked you
three times, minimum,
to step outta the car, correct?

05:51.767 --> 05:54.767
And when you don't listen,
it goes from ask, tell, make.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.667
Hey, come over here.
I'm gonna have you sit
on the curb down here, okay?

05:57.700 --> 06:01.433
I asked you, I told you,
next step is to make you,
and that's what we did.

06:01.467 --> 06:03.400
-You did.
-Have a seat.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.667
-(grunts)

06:09.567 --> 06:14.133
-He had, uh, these
in his pockets there, so.

06:14.167 --> 06:17.700
Yeah, we were asking him
to come out, and, uh,
he kinda started leaning back

06:17.733 --> 06:20.567
on us, he had a cigarette
in his, uh, left hand.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.067
His actions were just kind
of makin' us nervous.

06:24.067 --> 06:26.633
So Jeff went to go grab on him
first, he pulled back.

06:26.667 --> 06:30.067
I went to grab on him,
told him to drop the cigarette,
just 'cause I didn't want

06:30.067 --> 06:33.633
him burnin' my face with it.
We were able to get him
to the ground fairly easy.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.933
-He's got history of, uh,
DOC time, prison time,
and when I asked him

06:36.967 --> 06:40.533
about the weapons
he became very nervous
'cause he's prohibited.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.800
-All right,
here's the situation, okay?

06:42.833 --> 06:45.700
I know you didn't want it
to go this way tonight,
but that's what happened, okay?

06:45.733 --> 06:48.667
We did a traffic stop
on you, all we wanted to do
was get you outta the car

06:48.700 --> 06:51.767
and talk, okay?
When you start resisting--
when you start resisting

06:51.800 --> 06:53.533
like that, we don't know
where it's gonna go,

06:53.567 --> 06:55.300
we don't know
what's gonna happen.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.100
So that's
where it's went to, okay?
But tonight--

06:57.133 --> 06:59.333
-(indistinct)
-I know, but tonight
you're just gonna go down

06:59.367 --> 07:01.767
for the charges of resisting,
it's not that big of a deal.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.733
You'll be out probably tomorrow.
We'll start gettin' you
some help, okay?

07:04.767 --> 07:06.100
Have a better night, okay?

07:06.133 --> 07:08.133
What is the number one lesson
we just learned?

07:08.167 --> 07:10.600
When an officer asks you
to do somethin', do it.

07:12.667 --> 07:15.633
-Me and my wife,
we don't have kids,
however, we got a micro pet pig.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.533
She's 60 pounds, the love
of our life.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.467
Uh, her name's Tallulah.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.833
And actually, we have
childproof locks

07:21.867 --> 07:23.467
on all the pantry doors
because she knows

07:23.500 --> 07:25.333
where all the food is
in the house,

07:25.367 --> 07:26.967
and she knows
how to open those,

07:27.067 --> 07:28.767
believe it or not.
Sometimes it drives me up a wall

07:28.800 --> 07:31.300
and sometimes it doesn't.
You just gotta remember,

07:31.333 --> 07:35.333
hey, she's a pig,
she's known to just eat
and keep eating.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.533
-Voice on radio:
He's still maintaining
a normal speed,

07:37.567 --> 07:39.600
he's just not yielding.
-Uh, we got a unit

07:39.633 --> 07:41.400
that just did a tr--
uh, tried doin' a traffic stop,

07:41.433 --> 07:45.067
and the car is not fleeing,
but it's not stoppin', either.

07:45.067 --> 07:47.700
So what we're doin' right now
is tryin' to cut it off
and get ahead at least,

07:47.733 --> 07:49.367
try to get Stop Sticks out.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.067
We got a unit
right behind us, followin'.

07:51.067 --> 07:53.500
-Voice on radio:
Dumped somethin' outta the car
back there,

07:53.533 --> 07:55.500
it looks like weed
he's dumpin' out.

07:55.533 --> 07:57.833
-He's gonna come right up
to us.

07:57.867 --> 08:00.100
-(radio chatter)

08:06.300 --> 08:08.200
-Description of the car
one more time, please.

08:09.467 --> 08:13.633
-(sirens sounding)

08:13.667 --> 08:15.367
-Right there, perfect.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.667
-(sirens continue)

08:18.700 --> 08:20.300
-Copy, we see him.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.667
All right, we got good sticks,
still northbound.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.367
-Good job, yeah!

08:34.500 --> 08:36.833
-Voice on radio:
Unit 13, it's just traffic.

08:36.867 --> 08:39.400
He's got the passenger
front driver, it looks like,

08:39.433 --> 08:41.067
and he's picking up speed.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.600
-I'm gonna (indistinct).
-(sirens blaring)

08:43.633 --> 08:45.933
-All right.
He missed my sticks,
but there was another deputy

08:45.967 --> 08:47.633
that was on the other side
of the road.

08:47.667 --> 08:51.500
Uh, he ran over his sticks,
he got two of the tires
on the driver's side.

08:51.533 --> 08:55.500
So, we just had one of the--
Looks like he's lookin'
to bail him right now.

08:55.533 --> 08:57.633
-(radio chatter)

08:57.667 --> 08:59.600
-Voice on radio:
One on the ground at gunpoint.

09:10.567 --> 09:11.600
-Car's clear.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.067
Man, what are you doin'?

09:17.067 --> 09:19.067
-(dog barking)
-Huh?

09:20.533 --> 09:22.533
All right, bring your knees
up to your chest.

09:22.567 --> 09:24.867
Bring your knees
up to your chest.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.433
I got this side.

09:26.467 --> 09:28.167
All right, count of three,
one, two, three, up.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.233
-(dog continues barking)

09:31.267 --> 09:33.067
-Uh, whose car is that?

09:33.067 --> 09:35.800
-That's mine.
-(indistinct talk)

09:35.833 --> 09:38.967
-Sir, I was just tryin'
to pick up my wife at work,
she works here.

09:39.067 --> 09:40.567
That's why
I was rushin'.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.667
-And you just completely
ignored my deputy's efforts
to try to stop you

09:43.700 --> 09:45.367
with lights and sirens?

09:45.400 --> 09:48.600
-Well, with no license,
I know it's a direct...
-So you don't have

09:48.633 --> 09:50.533
a driver's license?
So you just figure eventually,

09:50.567 --> 09:52.533
we're just gonna turn around
and let you go?

09:52.567 --> 09:54.600
-Can you please
get my stuff--
-Yeah, it's gonna go with you.

09:54.633 --> 09:55.800
-Have a seat.

09:55.833 --> 09:56.867
-These cuffs
are pretty tight.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.200
-We'll get those situated
in a second.

09:59.233 --> 10:00.967
-Why didn't you just stop?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.400
-I wasn't fleeing,
I wasn't trying
to elude you guys.

10:03.433 --> 10:04.933
-You drove around
a set of Stop Sticks.

10:04.967 --> 10:07.100
-I didn't, uh, I didn't see
any Stop Sticks.

10:07.133 --> 10:08.733
-You drove around them.

10:08.767 --> 10:11.433
-If I drove around them,
the tires wouldn't be flat now.

10:11.467 --> 10:14.033
I didn't
see any Stop Sticks, sir.
-Uh-huh.

10:14.067 --> 10:17.167
-And I was just-- I didn't
flee and elude, I was just
goin' the speed limit...

10:17.200 --> 10:18.500
-So you figure
if a-- a police car--

10:18.533 --> 10:20.367
But you knew
that there was a police car
behind you?

10:20.400 --> 10:23.167
-I wanted to get to where
someone I knew, so I don't
get killed

10:23.200 --> 10:24.567
by any police officers.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.933
I'm a black male.
I just wanted to make sure
I get to safety.

10:26.967 --> 10:29.867
I didn't flee to elude.
I did the speed limit,
and stopped

10:29.900 --> 10:31.233
when I got here, sir.

10:31.267 --> 10:33.567
-You were drivin' around cars...
-The car was--

10:33.600 --> 10:35.033
What did
you throw out the window?

10:35.067 --> 10:36.967
-I didn't throw anything
out the window.
It was probably spit.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.433
I was spittin' out the window,
I don't know.

10:38.467 --> 10:43.067
But the cars I drove around,
they were doin' like 15 in a 40.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.800
-Yeah, because they saw
a police car comin' up
from behind 'em

10:45.833 --> 10:48.067
with red and blue lights
and sirens.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.633
You realize that you
just turned a traffic stop
into now...

10:51.667 --> 10:54.533
a-- a major production,
'cause you see how many
police cars are out there.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.367
-I didn't mean
for all this, I just--
-Had you stopped--

10:56.400 --> 10:58.967
How suspended is your license?
-I just wanted-- I just wanted
to get to safety.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.700
-How suspended is your license?

11:00.733 --> 11:04.067
-It's habitual.
-You're a habitual
traffic offender.

11:04.067 --> 11:06.867
-Yes, sir.
-You've been adjudicated
as a habitual traffic offender.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.600
-Just tryin' to get
to help my wife out.

11:08.633 --> 11:10.467
-If that's the case,
then why are you driving

11:10.500 --> 11:12.367
if you know you are
a habitual traffic offender?

11:12.400 --> 11:13.967
-I didn't expect any of this.

11:14.067 --> 11:16.767
-But you've been told
by numerous judges
not to drive

11:16.800 --> 11:18.533
because you're
a habitual traffic offender.

11:18.567 --> 11:21.067
-I'm not sure.
-You're not sure?

11:21.067 --> 11:25.467
-I don't remember,
it's been-- I'm not sure
the last time a judge told me

11:25.500 --> 11:28.833
directly with those same words
not to drive.

11:28.867 --> 11:32.567
-All right.
We're done, we're gonna
sort this out.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.167
-We found out
he was on the phone
with his wife,

11:34.200 --> 11:37.200
and actually
his wife works here.

11:37.233 --> 11:39.367
Uh, right now
we're gonna impound
the car.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.633
Uh, because we're
impounding it, we're doing
an inventory search.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.800
It already stinks like weed.

11:45.833 --> 11:47.667
There's a couple of stems
already here and there.

11:47.700 --> 11:51.833
They saw him throw
somethin' out, like a mile
or two down the road.

11:51.867 --> 11:53.767
Come to find out
it was the keys to the car.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.433
Probably tryin' to be slick,
thinkin' if we can't find
the keys, we can't put him

11:57.467 --> 12:00.400
behind the wheel of the car,
so therefore he can't
get charged with anything.

12:00.433 --> 12:03.067
Good idea, but obviously
it didn't play out for him.

12:03.067 --> 12:06.067
So, the Stop Sticks
that we used, obviously
they worked.

12:06.067 --> 12:07.233
I had mine on one side
of the street,

12:07.267 --> 12:09.200
and the other deputy
had his on the other side.

12:09.233 --> 12:13.533
'Cause earlier, the, uh,
the first set of sticks,
he just drove around.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.400
However, this time,
when he saw mine,

12:15.433 --> 12:18.233
he probably drove
around mine, then realized
he saw the other ones.

12:18.267 --> 12:21.633
So, once he saw the other ones
it was already too late,
'cause there's nothin' to do

12:21.667 --> 12:24.067
goin' 40 miles an hour,
it's impossible to stop.

12:24.067 --> 12:27.167
So obviously, the-- the sticks
were very effective
on the, uh, other deputy

12:27.200 --> 12:29.900
that was on the other side
of the road, 'cause he got three
of the four.

12:29.933 --> 12:32.600
Uh, Josh, help me understand,
what was your thought process
goin' through the--

12:32.633 --> 12:36.333
the whole thing, when you saw
a couple of cruisers behind you
in the rear view mirrors?

12:36.367 --> 12:38.300
-Is there any real crime
goin' on?

12:38.333 --> 12:43.667
Why are so many cruisers
chasin' this-- this guy
that's doin' 40 miles per hour,

12:43.700 --> 12:45.667
doing the speed limit?
-'Cause he's not stopping.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.567
-Do this routine
traffic stop that ain't even
exceedin' the speed limit.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.400
-Yeah.
-But it's not a routine
traffic stop if you don't stop.

12:51.433 --> 12:54.833
-And when I got out the car
and lay down on the ground...
-Mm-hm.

12:54.867 --> 12:57.300
-it only took one guy
to put the handcuffs on me.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.233
One guy to bring me in here.

12:59.267 --> 13:02.867
So, all this extra stuff
is-- was uncalled for.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.733
-Mm-hm.
-I was thinkin' about stopping
the first time I saw

13:05.767 --> 13:06.900
the red and blue lights.

13:06.933 --> 13:09.567
When I saw him
do a u-turn to come around me,

13:09.600 --> 13:11.933
I immediately got on the phone
and called her, and told her

13:11.967 --> 13:14.867
that I was gonna stop
at her job, so I did plan
to stop.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.633
That was the whole plan,
to stop.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.500
-Okay.
So you were eventually
gonna stop,

13:18.533 --> 13:19.567
you just didn't know where.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.133
-I knew where.
-Which was here.

13:21.167 --> 13:22.733
-Where-- Where this woman
would be.

13:22.767 --> 13:24.767
-Okay.
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

13:24.800 --> 13:27.700
-I'm a good guy
and, that's the end.

13:27.733 --> 13:30.267
-He turned
a regular traffic stop
into a felony.

13:33.167 --> 13:34.700
-The transition
into law enforcement

13:34.733 --> 13:37.333
was easy for me.
I grew up most of my life

13:37.367 --> 13:40.067
playin' sports.
I grew up an athlete.

13:40.067 --> 13:41.567
They have a lot of things
in common.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.900
Uh, the discipline,
the work ethic,

13:43.933 --> 13:45.300
they carried over
from the field

13:45.333 --> 13:47.333
out into
the-- the concrete jungle

13:47.367 --> 13:50.600
out here, and it's very easy
to do.

13:50.633 --> 13:53.833
I've got this car,
and it looks like they just
did a sharp turn

13:53.867 --> 13:56.467
right over here, it looks like
they're tryin' to get away

13:56.500 --> 13:59.367
unnoticed, like we're not gonna
see what's goin' on with them.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.533
Looks like they tried to park.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.567
I ran the plate,
it came back suspended.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.167
The driver-- The owner
of the vehicle,

14:05.200 --> 14:08.967
uh, she's known to be a,
uh, a very heavy drug user.

14:12.067 --> 14:13.433
How you doin'?

14:15.567 --> 14:16.900
You know
your plate's suspended?

14:16.933 --> 14:20.567
-Yes, I'm just tryin'
to get home to my kids.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.233
-Where are you comin' from?

14:22.267 --> 14:26.067
-Well, I went--
I went to go get a pack
of cigarettes.

14:26.100 --> 14:28.067
-A pack of smokes?
-Yes, I know it's
not that important

14:28.067 --> 14:29.733
to drive on suspended plates.

14:29.767 --> 14:31.800
-All right, miss,
I'm gonna ask you
to step out of the vehicle.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.433
Your license
is also suspended.

14:34.733 --> 14:36.533
You don't have a license,
and the car is not registered,

14:36.567 --> 14:38.433
so I'm gonna
tow the car tonight.

14:40.467 --> 14:41.800
All right.

14:41.833 --> 14:43.933
Is there anything in the car
that I need to know about?

14:43.967 --> 14:47.967
-No. I have a, uh...
backpack in there,
and that's it.

14:48.067 --> 14:49.567
I think my toolbox
isn't even in there.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.100
-Your toolbox and stuff?
-I don't think it's in there
right now, no.

14:52.133 --> 14:54.600
-All right.

14:54.633 --> 14:56.867
Hey, you didn't tell me
there was a guy back here.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.133
-I'm sorry!

14:58.167 --> 15:01.167
-All right.
Go ahead and unfasten
your seat belt.

15:05.067 --> 15:07.367
You have I.D. on you?
-No, I don't.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.933
-You have a-- What happened
right here?

15:08.967 --> 15:11.567
-It's a scratch.
-From...?

15:11.600 --> 15:13.100
-From playin'
with my dog.

15:13.133 --> 15:14.567
-Okay.
-He's a puppy.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.067
-Do you mind
if I look around your vehicle?

15:18.067 --> 15:21.700
All right.
We got consent
to search the vehicle.

15:21.733 --> 15:23.833
Uh, we're looking
for any narcotics,
paraphernalia,

15:23.867 --> 15:26.567
anything of that nature.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.267
-All right, well, until
we have this taken care of,

15:28.300 --> 15:31.300
let me detain you
for a minute, okay?
Turn around.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.633
If you're gonna be squirrelly,
I wanna make sure
what's happenin' here.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.067
Not gonna get too squirrelly
with me, okay?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.600
-Naw, man.

15:36.633 --> 15:40.067
-Hey, I've got burnt
tin foil.

15:40.067 --> 15:43.067
Looks like there's--
Appears to be a little bit
of residue on some tin foil

15:43.067 --> 15:45.967
right here.
-So there's
paraphernalia in the car.

15:46.067 --> 15:48.400
If any of you are doing drugs,
who's that gonna be?

15:48.433 --> 15:49.633
Anybody gonna tell me?

15:49.667 --> 15:52.533
-Y-- Not it.
I have five daughters.

15:52.567 --> 15:56.333
I've done stupid (bleep)
like anybody.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.467
-You don't do any drugs at all?
-No.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.067
-And you're saying
you've been clean since...?

16:00.100 --> 16:02.733
-I'm in WestCare,
they drug test me.
-Okay.

16:02.767 --> 16:06.700
What about you?
-I'm-- I'm-- I smoke weed, sir,
every day, that's it.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.233
-You smoke weed
every day?

16:08.267 --> 16:10.700
So no meth, amphetamine?
-No, sir.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.233
-No pill chasing?

16:13.267 --> 16:16.067
-Sir, I've-- I've been
clean off pills
since October 9th.

16:16.067 --> 16:18.800
-Since October 9th?
-The pills was about a week ago.

16:18.833 --> 16:21.867
-Pills.
-And the weed, I-- The weed
would be in my system for sure.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.800
-So the pills
are a week ago? Okay.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.967
-All right, miss, I'm gonna
come and step right over here
and talk to you for a minute.

16:27.067 --> 16:30.233
-I don't why the hell
that's in my car.
I swear.

16:30.267 --> 16:32.867
-Does the kid use, what?
-I don't know him.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.600
-You don't know him?
-I don't know him.
I-- I just know--

16:35.633 --> 16:39.500
I've known him for a while,
I kind of watched him
grow up with my niece, and...

16:39.533 --> 16:42.533
-Is he gonna
have narcotics on him?
-I have no idea.

16:42.567 --> 16:45.800
-All right, I'm gonna
talk to them, see if anyone
owns up to it,

16:45.833 --> 16:48.367
but, it's your car.
Nobody's gonna own up to it,
you know how that goes.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.800
-Yeah, I know.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.433
-All right.
I'm gonna have you--
I'm gonna have you wait

16:52.467 --> 16:55.300
right back over here
by the front of the car
for me.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.167
Can I talk to you?
-Yeah.

16:59.200 --> 17:03.600
-All right.
I think Sergeant
already talked to you also?

17:03.633 --> 17:05.367
-Yeah.
-Did you ever use black?

17:05.400 --> 17:08.467
-I've been clean
since October,
but it was two months

17:08.500 --> 17:10.567
before that,
because I got arrested
and went to rehab.

17:10.600 --> 17:13.633
I'm in WestCare currently.
I don't know if you know,
but they drug test you

17:13.667 --> 17:14.700
up there?
-Yeah.

17:14.733 --> 17:18.100
-Weekly.
So, yeah, I'm... no.

17:18.133 --> 17:21.633
-All right.
-I know for a fact
that he uses black.

17:21.667 --> 17:24.167
Probably today, to be honest
with you.

17:24.200 --> 17:28.100
-He does use black?
-Yeah. I mean, I know
for a fact, yeah.

17:28.133 --> 17:31.067
-All right.
-I wish I wasn't there, but...

17:31.100 --> 17:34.633
-Are you--
Is that his paraphernalia
that I found in the car?

17:36.667 --> 17:39.133
All right.
You can go ahead,
go back over there.

17:39.167 --> 17:41.100
All right, my man, come on.

17:44.567 --> 17:46.100
They're both sayin'
it's yours.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.600
They're both sayin'
that you use black,

17:47.633 --> 17:49.367
and they're both
sayin' it's yours.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.867
And that you probably
got high today.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.467
-No, sir.
-Are you under the influence
right now?

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
-Not at this moment, no, sir.
-Not at this moment?

17:57.533 --> 18:00.067
When's-- When's
the last time you got high?

18:00.067 --> 18:02.167
Two, three days ago.
-Two days ago?

18:02.200 --> 18:04.300
And it's meth?
-Yes, sir.

18:04.333 --> 18:08.733
-Two days ago bein'...
Wednesday? Thursday? Friday?

18:08.767 --> 18:10.200
What day was it?

18:10.233 --> 18:12.067
-Friday.
-Friday?

18:12.067 --> 18:14.267
-Friday night.
-Friday night?

18:14.300 --> 18:16.067
Well, you know,
it's only Saturday.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.800
So again, you're lyin'
again, man, that's
not two days.

18:21.633 --> 18:25.633
-What's today,
S-- Sun-- Saturday?
-Yeah.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.800
Here's the deal.
I'm gonna take you to jail.
You're under arrest

18:27.833 --> 18:30.467
for being under the influence
of a controlled substance.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.133
All right, go ahead
and have a seat
inside the car.

18:32.167 --> 18:34.900
-I haven't smoked anything
for two days.

18:34.933 --> 18:37.833
I thought today was Sunday.
I swear to God.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.833
-Then what we'll do,
if we get down to the jail
and you pee clean,

18:40.867 --> 18:43.067
you're free to go.
Call for a ride home.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.667
Go ahead, have a seat.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.400
I'm gonna
take your hat, all right?
-I swear to God, dude.

18:48.433 --> 18:49.933
-Go ahead, have a seat
in the car.

18:49.967 --> 18:51.433
-I didn't do (bleep) wrong.

18:51.467 --> 18:53.367
-Go ahead, twist, turn,
get in the car for me.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.167
-You've asked me how long ago
I used, and I told you,
it's been two days.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.100
-All right.
I'll talk to you
in detention, man.

19:01.233 --> 19:03.467
All right, we're gonna
come right through
this first open door.

19:05.367 --> 19:08.633
All right, if you wanna
step over to the toilet area.

19:15.533 --> 19:19.733
So, a first-time offender
like this, the best thing
we can do

19:19.767 --> 19:24.300
is try to walk them through
the process of jail, and hope
we can scare 'em enough

19:24.333 --> 19:26.933
that they don't wanna come back.

19:26.967 --> 19:32.267
All right, so you can see
clearly here, you've got
one line positive for meth,

19:32.300 --> 19:36.233
you've got one line
for opiates,

19:36.267 --> 19:39.067
you've got negative, negative,

19:39.067 --> 19:42.167
and then a positive again
for THC.

19:42.200 --> 19:45.133
So, he can sit in jail
for a night and sober up,

19:45.167 --> 19:48.133
and hopefully, thinks
about and reflects on
what happened tonight.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.700
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.667
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.700 --> 19:54.833
Cover is code three.

19:54.867 --> 19:57.833
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.133 --> 20:06.100
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.133 --> 20:09.133
-(theme music playing)
