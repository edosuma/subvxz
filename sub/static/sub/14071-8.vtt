Shit, Anderson gave you every excuse, man.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.027
You know, I did plow through
a bottle of tequila last night

tell anybody about this for now. Huh?

with the sign behind it

07:08.219 --> 07:09.470

07:09.554 --> 07:11.419
For a laptop and some wi-fi?

11:43.661 --> 11:45.197
I'm curious, too.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.573
Yeah, me, too.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.790
Dripping Wet MlLFs.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.284
(LAUGHING)

11:53.546 --> 11:56.538
Shut up. Okay, no, you two
can go fuck yourselves.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.339
-Shut up, okay?
-l'm notjudging.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.132
I happen to feel
that there's something sensual

12:00.220 --> 12:02.802
about older women, no matter how taboo it is.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.505
All right, old dudes date
hot, young chicks all the time.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.682
Hey, listen, that's a total double standard.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.681
And I get it, but what you just said,
you should never share with anyone.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.558
TRAVIS: Fucking both you...
Fuck both of you guys.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.810
I hate you all. I hate you.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.562
-Are we almost done here?
-Mmm-mmm.

12:16.653 --> 12:17.688
-(MUSIC PLAYING)
-I didn't know the Rams

12:17.779 --> 12:19.019
were gonna come with that big an offer.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.944
Shoot, it must be nice
to be in such high demand.

12:21.032 --> 12:24.069
Chuck, it's 12 mil per, 18 guaranteed.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.321
I already told Siefert
that you were accepting our offer.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.119
I'm pretty sure that motherfucker
understands the concept of money.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.993
I'm gonna look like a fool.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.949
I pioneered this deal for you, Ricky.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.126
Well, he should've paid me
when he had the chance.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.920
Believe it or not, I got a better chance
of winning with the Rams, anyway.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.293
-You can win here, too.
-Hey, bro, are you kidding me?

12:40.385 --> 12:42.592
You was the main one
bitching all last year about the organization.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.964
I was wrong.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.340
Now that they gave you a job.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.763
I earned thatjob, you hear me?

12:48.768 --> 12:51.726
-Sel|ing cars.
-What that got to do with anything?

12:51.813 --> 12:54.600
Coming back, left tackle,
right tackle, front office.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.898
-I can't keep up with the fuck you doing, man.
-(STAMMERING)

12:56.985 --> 13:00.148
Look, I know what's important to me.
Obviously, you do not.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.856
Hey, man, my family's important to me.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.361
And my friends.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.325
Then football.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.661
Money don't even crack my list.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.739
Which explains your wack—ass offer.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.298
Jordana, could you cancel my order, please?

13:19.382 --> 13:21.714
-Sure.
-I ain't hungry no more.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.754
You received 15 unnecessary
roughness penalties

13:28.850 --> 13:30.056
in your last 24 games.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.634
What can I say? I like to hit people.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.937
Mental error is all the difference
between wins and losses at the next level.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.231
You have the skills to be
the leading tackle in the NFL,

13:38.318 --> 13:39.649
but it requires discipline.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.192
100% focus.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.564
I'm 1,000% focused, sir.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.984
But those girls over there
are definitely checking us out.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.203
Good peripheral vision.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.080
You have no idea.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.755
Okay, Spencer.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.003
-Sorry for the hold up.
-Hey, no problem.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.759
Ooh.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.212
You've been banking with us
for quite a long time.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.923
Ever since that first $150
my freshmen year at the U.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.181
-Oh, wow.
-(LAUGHING)

14:13.436 --> 14:15.017
I mean, I'm hoping that counts for something.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.187
Well, I mean, you're
perfectly qualified for a loan.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.350
But I have to say, this amount is

14:21.778 --> 14:23.518
way beyond your means.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.821
Look, every client on that application
will run through a wall for me, okay?

14:26.908 --> 14:29.240
And they know that I'd do the same for them.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.034
My business is golden, Jeff.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.284
I wish it were just up to me,
but we have checks and balances.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.707
You know, your financial history is...

14:37.794 --> 14:39.955
Is history.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.878
I mean, you just said it, history is history.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.714
Hey, I'm not that guy anymore, okay?

14:45.802 --> 14:48.669
I got a lot of plans, I got goals to meet.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.220
I'll lay every asset that I have on the line.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.808
If there's any way you can help me,

14:52.892 --> 14:54.632
you know I'm good for it.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.636
(INHALES SHARPLY, EXHALES)

14:58.022 --> 15:00.229
Let's take another look at it.

15:00.316 --> 15:04.355
Let me ask you a question, son.
Are you a dick?

15:04.487 --> 15:05.476
(TRAVIS CHUCKLES)

15:06.781 --> 15:08.442
If I say no, makes me a liar,

15:08.533 --> 15:10.524
and if I say yes, you're not gonna draft me,

15:10.618 --> 15:13.655
so I'll go with... Sometimes.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.452
People say you're a loose cannon.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.077
They say only a fool would draft you,
no matter how hard you hit.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.876
With all due respect, sir, I can learn to behave
in any way that suits my employers,

15:21.963 --> 15:23.919
but nobody can teach what I do on the field.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.917
What if everyone in the locker room
thinks you're an asshole?

15:26.008 --> 15:29.136
Name one player in any locker room
that has ever said that I'm an asshole.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.209
Scouts talk about it.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.592
Scouts, sir, not players.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.219
Look, my teammates are like family.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.766
Ain't one of them ever said
a bad word about me, I guarantee it.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.767
Yeah, I may be an occasional dick,

15:43.192 --> 15:45.183
but I ain't no asshole.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.986
Good. We're clear on that.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.822

16:21.230 --> 16:23.607
Thank you.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.148
Spice, you're early.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.567
Yeah, you know I had to get
a jump on that Miami traffic.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.070
Yeah. Well, just make yourself at home.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.648
-How was jury duty?
-It was interesting.

16:33.743 --> 16:37.076
(EXHALES) I never knew they had
an operation to make your wang bigger.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.370
(LAUGHS) Yeah, that's the wonders
of modern medicine, man.

16:39.457 --> 16:43.120
Hey, look, I'm gonna pop into the office
on Monday, go over some of my stocks.

16:43.211 --> 16:46.248
Feeling that urge to diversify a little bit more.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.829
Okay, you know what?
It'll be better if! pick you up.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.209
So I'll do that and I'll take you to lunch.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.756
Even better.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.710
-Sushi?
-You got it.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.510
-Thank you.
-Appreciate it, man.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.054
I'll put it back and fix this...

It's finally here, relax!

-Joe. What up, though?

17:02.063 --> 17:03.678
Spice. What's up, buddy?

17:03.773 --> 17:05.183
Save some of those ribs for me, huh?

17:05.274 --> 17:06.605
I ain't gonna make you no promises.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.432
-Hey.
-Look at that.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.393
Look, I got your backup cell.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.945
-Appreciate that.
-That's the third one this month.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.365
Maybe you should think
of a more cost-effective way to vent.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.817
Like, urn...

17:17.912 --> 17:19.527
How about interpretive dance?

17:19.622 --> 17:20.702
Ah, that's a great idea.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.247
I'll head over to Andre's office
and dance right on his fucking face.

see that he's stressed.

for that phone to ring.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.188
Yeah, sounds like you're keeping it together.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.688
Yeah, well, half a Xanax
and a gin gimletwill do it.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.689
Listen, if Phil/y takes Carson Wentz,

18:34.780 --> 18:37.943
the Cowboys could change directions
and take a DT,

18:38.034 --> 18:39.774
which might not bode well for Vernon.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.450
I just spoke with Mel and he said that they are

18:41.537 --> 18:44.779
seriously considering
Dexter Baines from A&M.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.284
Any less depressing news?

18:46.459 --> 18:49.166
Jacksonville and Baltimore
have taken a shine to Travis

18:49.253 --> 18:52.541
at five and six.
Now, I don't necessarily trust it,

18:52.632 --> 18:54.668
but the kid’s got a shot. How’s he doing?

18:57.928 --> 19:00.010
-Nerves of steel.
-Good to hear.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.712

-Trust me.
-Yeah.

that meeting with Travis.

-He's not half bad.
-The kid's charming, right?

still around in the second,

19:26.666 --> 19:28.076
Just... You know, I looked at my mom.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.034
-She was smiling, you know?
-Who cried first?

19:31.128 --> 19:33.540
-My mom cried.
-Your mom cried, too?

19:33.631 --> 19:35.542
-How about you?
-I cried first.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.668

-MAN: I hear you.
-When you look at it from up top

19:40.054 --> 19:41.544
it's a whole different game.

19:41.639 --> 19:42.924
I've been telling her about it.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.882
-It is...
-Hey, Ricky, honey. How are you?

19:47.770 --> 19:49.180
Good.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.932
-Chuck.
-Rick.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.515
Aw! Fellas. This brings back old memories.

19:54.610 --> 19:58.353
If Tampa wouldn't have picked both of you,
you wouldn't be such good friends now.

19:58.656 --> 19:59.771
Yeah, that's true.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.117
What, you not in the war room
with the brain trust?

20:02.743 --> 20:06.031
Oh, no, Siefert kicked my ass out
once you put that dagger in my back.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.078
Food smells good.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.280
SPENCER: Yo, Rick!

20:10.459 --> 20:11.869
Oh, hey, Rick, you might wanna go.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.576
Your financial manager's calling.

with $100 million per season...

You're being an ass, Mr. Greane.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.049
Ricky's just doing what's best for him.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.805
Was there ever a time when he didn't?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.271
Hmm, let's see.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.016
There was that time
he went after James Harrison

20:33.107 --> 20:34.438
for stepping on your hand.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.982
Oh, right, and then there was that time
that he threatened to quit the team

20:38.320 --> 20:39.480
This is different.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.314
Yeah, because it's something that you want.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.361
Ricky's just being who he's always been.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.202
The Rams are pressing Jason.
They need an answer.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.782
Yeah, but now that the Rams are
in Los Angeles, it's gonna be tough.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.580
That's a tough town for me to walk
the path in with that temptation.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.083
Yes, I understand that,
but this is the largest receiver contract

20:58.174 --> 20:59.380
in free agency.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.708
Rick, it's everything you want.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.667
I know, man, but Chuck,
he already went out on a limb

21:03.763 --> 21:05.128
to swing this other offer for me.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.964
Hey, with all due respect to Miami,
I mean, that offer is soft, man.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.014
-And Miami's future is bleak.
-Says who? What...

21:10.102 --> 21:11.182
-Rick.
-LaMarr.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.385

-Hello.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.595

21:14.899 --> 21:16.355

21:16.442 --> 21:18.728

Yeah, I added a new feature.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.818
How do you expect to handle my cash
when you can't even enter the building?

21:30.539 --> 21:33.281
For the time being, Joe's gonna handle
your day-to-day.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.875

a pot to piss in, either.

financial managers I've ever met.

21:47.056 --> 21:50.514

I totally understand.

21:54.230 --> 21:56.596

21:57.566 --> 21:59.557

MARK: (ON TV) While some believe
Mack is the most physically gifted linebacker

22:16.293 --> 22:19.535
this is not the draft class
you want to have off-the-ﬁeld issues,

22:19.630 --> 22:21.370
because it’s loaded with edge rushers,

22:21.465 --> 22:24.127
like Ohio State’s Joey Bosa.

22:24.218 --> 22:28.211
If Mack drops below eight,
the free fall could go all the way to the 20s.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.011
Maybe even into the second round.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.841
So, with LA on the clock,
let’s talk about which...

22:32.935 --> 22:35.768
Don't trip. You'll still get money in the 20s.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.691
-Hey.
-JOE: Hey.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.902
Ricky offered to lend me $5 million.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.487
-Nice!
-Yeah.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.914
I mean, I figured between this house
and some other assets,

22:57.001 --> 22:58.537
the bank could get us up to about seven.

22:58.627 --> 23:01.369
I could get us up to 7.2,
7.3 if I called my mom,

23:01.463 --> 23:04.045
so probably more like 7.2.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.543
Hey, if we can just get within striking range,

23:05.634 --> 23:07.670
then Anderson might be able
to lower the price.

23:07.761 --> 23:10.047
I mean, why sell to Andre the Giant
when he can sell

23:10.139 --> 23:12.255
to two unregistered party boys, huh?

23:12.349 --> 23:14.010
That's just simple math.

23:23.861 --> 23:24.850
What's up?

23:25.404 --> 23:26.484
What up?

23:27.990 --> 23:30.652
Look, I think you should accept
the Rams' offer.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.195
You're just gonna pivot on me just like that?

23:32.286 --> 23:34.572
Yeah, you already
got your pops making things tough.

23:34.663 --> 23:35.994
Ain't no use in me making it worse.

are still keeping in touch.
