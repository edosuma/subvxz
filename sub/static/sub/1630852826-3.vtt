WEBVTT

00:19.394 --> 00:20.311
Fuck.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.689
Um…

00:25.108 --> 00:25.942
Okay…

00:26.609 --> 00:28.361
I said yes to Kyle…

00:30.572 --> 00:33.450
because I do… I do have feelings for Kyle.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.077
I'm just scared that I made a decision

00:36.161 --> 00:39.873
that was the wrong decision. I don't know.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.333
I really care about Shayne.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.627
I think he's a beautiful person.

00:45.628 --> 00:48.631
I've told Shayne that I liked him,
but I've not really said,

00:48.715 --> 00:50.383
"I have deep feelings for you."

00:50.467 --> 00:54.554
And from what I've observed,
he definitely needs reassurance.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.181
I've been way too passive.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.767
I'm finally strong enough

00:58.850 --> 01:01.394
to have the courage
to do what I have to do.

01:05.148 --> 01:09.736
I just wanted you to know
that I do have deep feelings for you.

01:12.864 --> 01:16.242
I do envision a life
with you together, and I do…

01:16.326 --> 01:19.287
Honestly, I really do care for you a lot.

01:24.667 --> 01:28.213
Like, I do… I do have your back,
and I would be loyal to you

01:28.296 --> 01:30.048
and faithful to you and…

01:32.008 --> 01:35.178
fight for you,
and be that rock in your life,

01:35.261 --> 01:36.846
and a true wife to you.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.063
I've expressed
this kind of stuff,

01:45.146 --> 01:47.941
and I was kind of waiting
for that to happen with you and it--

01:48.024 --> 01:48.858
Yeah.

01:49.526 --> 01:53.780
It's like we wasted so much fucking time
the last two days not even talking.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.532
I wished you would've said that like…

01:55.615 --> 01:56.491
-No, I know.

01:56.574 --> 01:57.742
…days earlier now.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.954
And it's like, I--
I felt the same way.

02:01.037 --> 02:04.165
I just wish we had that fucking time back
the last couple days.

02:04.749 --> 02:08.086
I know. I took a backseat and I regret it.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.259
My pride definitely got in the way.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.469
Shaina!

02:18.471 --> 02:20.265
God. Fuck.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.933
I know. I'm really sorry.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.643
-I know.

02:23.726 --> 02:24.561
Fuck.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.021
Fuck, I don't even know
what to think right now. God!

02:27.105 --> 02:29.399
And we can keep this private
so it doesn't--

02:29.482 --> 02:33.361
Well, trust me, it's not gonna fuckin'--
That's not for anyone else's business.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.405
You had the chance.

02:39.534 --> 02:43.872
This is not happening now. The connection
I have with Natalie is just so strong.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.876
It's too late for that.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.434
I just said yes to Kyle.
Like, me saying that to Shayne,

03:04.517 --> 03:08.271
knowing that he's gonna propose
to Natalie. That sounds so fucked up.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.982
But, like, I did see a life with Shayne.

03:11.941 --> 03:15.069
You feel you can get that out of Natalie,
what you think you're wanting?

03:15.570 --> 03:17.071
I hope you do find it.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.783
I don't wanna look like that person…
that's, like, making judgments

03:20.867 --> 03:23.077
on what their life would look like,

03:23.161 --> 03:27.540
but I would be the only one
that can really be that…

03:29.667 --> 03:32.879
wife for him in a real genuine
and authentic way.

03:34.214 --> 03:39.260
Looking back,
I just regret not… opening up sooner.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.428
Ugh.

03:44.807 --> 03:45.808
Goddammit.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.880
What Shaina said to me today,
I needed that two days ago.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.216
It's just… It's too late.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.512
Natalie makes me feel secure.
She makes me feel safe.

04:23.972 --> 04:28.017
This has been the one that I am
fully gonna give all my heart to,

04:28.101 --> 04:30.019
and I don't even know what she looks like.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.314
And, quite frankly,
I really don't care, because I love her.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.109
-Hello.
-Hello.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.777
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.988
-How are you doing?
-I'm good.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.993
-I'm a man of a lot of words.
-I know.

04:45.076 --> 04:49.163
So, when I don't have a lot of words,
honestly, it's, like…

04:49.247 --> 04:52.625
That's what happens with you.
I get those butterflies with you.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.627
I get all the special feelings for you.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.590
This last week and a half
has been life-changing.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.388
I mean…

05:05.471 --> 05:07.598
I'm gonna get down on a knee.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.267
You can't see me, but--

05:12.770 --> 05:15.440
Natalie, I mean, I love you.

05:17.233 --> 05:22.488
I cannot wait to see you,
explore the rest of my life with you.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.825
Um, so, Natalie…

05:28.119 --> 05:29.704
will you marry me?

05:31.748 --> 05:34.250
-Yes. Oh my gosh, of course.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.626
Yes.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.421
-I wish I could just kiss you right now.
-I know. Same.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.923
-I'm so fucking happy.
-I know. Me too.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.926
I'm so excited
to spend the rest of my life with you.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.805
It's so cruel now. It's, like,
I just wanna run through a wall.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.892
I'm so excited for this.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.226
-I'm ready for it.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.729
My heart's pounding
out of my chest right now.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.022
It's fucking crazy.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.899
I'm an engaged person. Yes.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.025
Very happy.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.985
I can't fuckin' stop moving around.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.362
I'm just so excited.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.365
I love you, and I will see you tomorrow.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.534
-I love you too.
-Okay. Oh my God.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.037
-All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.040
My God.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.166
Holy fuck.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.543
My God!

06:18.419 --> 06:19.962
Oh, my God!

06:26.719 --> 06:28.554
Natalie is the complete package.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.557
I'm excited to spend literally
every waking moment with Natalie.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.268
I just can't wait.
I just need to see her and touch her.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.104
To make sure she's real.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.704
Outside of what fucking happened
to me last year,

06:53.788 --> 06:55.790
this is the scariest shit in my life.

06:55.873 --> 06:59.419
I've really put myself out there
in a way that I haven't done in the past,

06:59.502 --> 07:01.170
and I am invested.

07:01.254 --> 07:05.675
I feel like Jarrette and I are having
similar feelings for Mallory.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.970
I feel that, and I know that,

07:09.053 --> 07:12.598
but all I can focus on
is what I feel for Mallory.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.310
And we acknowledge
that Mallory has a choice.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.189
And that's out of our control.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.067
It's just a lot, man.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.945
You know what's fucking great
about all this though, bro?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.573
This is what being human is about, dude.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.908
-I want to feel this, dude. I wanna…
-Yeah.

07:31.909 --> 07:35.288
I don't care if I'm hurt.
I don't care if I'm in pain.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.040
I'm fucking alive, dude.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.503
I don't believe that I have felt…

07:42.587 --> 07:43.713
Crazy!

07:43.796 --> 07:45.840
…stuff like this ever in my life.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.010
We got one life to live, you know? Like…

07:50.887 --> 07:52.388
shit can be good one day,

07:52.889 --> 07:56.058
and the next day,
shit can be completely different.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.603
I know that I'm here for a reason.

07:59.687 --> 08:03.024
I'm alive for a reason. I'm doing
this experiment for a reason, you know?

08:03.107 --> 08:06.194
I can't tell you why the fuck
these women are running through my mind

08:06.277 --> 08:08.988
and I'm feeling all types of ways
for these women.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.573
I can't make this shit out.

08:11.073 --> 08:14.952
I'm not gonna be okay
until I get down on a knee

08:15.036 --> 08:17.955
to the person that I feel like
is the best one here for me,

08:18.039 --> 08:19.540
-and she says yes.
-Hoo.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.502
The weight of the world
is gonna be lifted off of my shoulders.

08:23.544 --> 08:24.378
Yeah, man.

08:24.962 --> 08:28.007
Earlier this week, I was going
back and forth between Mallory and Iyanna,

08:28.090 --> 08:30.259
but over the past couple days,
I've gained clarity.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.514
I can definitely see myself proposing
and having a life with Iyanna,

08:35.014 --> 08:39.560
but I want to propose to Mallory
and it's gonna feel crazy, you know.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.479
I'm gonna feel a whirlwind of emotions,

08:41.562 --> 08:44.232
but I'll be celebrating
my 50th anniversary with Mallory.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.608
This is for life.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.086
Ho-ho!

09:05.169 --> 09:08.756
-Oh my God!
-Ho-ho!

09:08.839 --> 09:12.301
It's Taco Tuesday and we were talking
about how tacos are your favorite food.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.636
-So…
-Yeah.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.805
This is so nice.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.349
Oh my God, you're so sweet!

09:19.559 --> 09:22.979
I feel like the connection
that we've made, the bond is there.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.357
We're… I like so much about you,

09:26.857 --> 09:28.901
and it just… It feels right.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.572
It's enough there for me to be like,

09:32.655 --> 09:36.409
"You know what? I can see myself
with this person for the rest of my life."

09:36.492 --> 09:37.326
Yeah?

09:37.827 --> 09:40.913
Do you really see a future with me?
Like, if I was to propose to you?

09:49.463 --> 09:51.257
I'm such a fucking ugly crier.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.554
Since the beginning, I just…

09:57.096 --> 09:59.181
I connect with you so well, and I…

09:59.265 --> 10:03.728
We have so much in common,
and I could talk to you about everything

10:03.811 --> 10:08.774
and it's fun and I laugh with you a lot.
And I love talking to you all the time.

10:09.817 --> 10:12.486
You're such an amazing person, and…

10:16.198 --> 10:17.033
But,

10:18.451 --> 10:21.996
there's always really been two people
I've just felt very strongly for,

10:22.079 --> 10:27.501
and I feel like
my other connection is just, um…

10:29.503 --> 10:33.716
I feel like I'm just drawn more to that.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.033
I'm really sorry.

11:02.036 --> 11:02.912
Fuck!

11:18.761 --> 11:20.054
Are you okay?

11:22.848 --> 11:23.683
Jarrette.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.560
No, I'm not.

11:40.908 --> 11:43.786
I could see a lot of stuff with you,

11:44.286 --> 11:46.372
but I can't help but feeling…

11:48.374 --> 11:51.669
I mean, I don't know what to…
What can I say?

11:51.752 --> 11:54.422
Like, damn, it's over.

12:06.475 --> 12:10.104
It's like one decision
just changes your life.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.233


12:17.903 --> 12:19.864
It's just overwhelming, like…

12:20.448 --> 12:23.409
With Sal it's just,
like, I can't ignore it.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.203
I feel like Sal's more, like, my heart.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.957
I never thought
that I'd be in this position.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.084
I don't wanna hurt anyone else.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.670
I don't want
to make anyone feel like that.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.857
I'm sorry.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.159
Oh my God.

13:31.268 --> 13:32.102
Hey.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.772
Do you want privacy?

13:34.855 --> 13:35.689
Yeah.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.984
Okay. I'm here if you need something.

13:47.868 --> 13:48.744
You all right?

13:49.286 --> 13:50.704
Fuck no, I'm not.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.919
I asked her, if I was to propose to her,
would she accept?

13:57.419 --> 14:01.757
She said, "No. My feelings
are stronger for someone else."

14:03.968 --> 14:07.471
You can tell me to, seriously,
like, fuck off right now,

14:08.264 --> 14:13.185
but I know you connected with Iyanna.
You know she's very into you as well.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.728
Everybody knows she is.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.680
I could not fall asleep last night.
I'm so excited for this.

14:51.473 --> 14:54.518
Not that I even care
about what he looks like,

14:54.602 --> 14:59.064
but it's just the fact that I get to
touch him and kiss him and hug him.

14:59.148 --> 15:04.320
But, yeah, I'm so nervous,
I'm gonna puke, pretty much.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.280
Yeah.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.868
I've never had this feeling
ever in my entire life,

15:10.951 --> 15:12.202
and I live off of adrenaline.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.964
I just truly feel like, you know,
she's the most genuine person in the world

15:24.048 --> 15:28.093
and I'm ready to fucking, like,
break through some walls to see her.

15:28.177 --> 15:32.097
Oh my God.
It's like I'm peeking. Okay.

15:32.681 --> 15:36.518
No one else outside of this experiment
will ever be able to understand

15:36.602 --> 15:39.355
how it's even possible, but it's true.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.857
When you take everything else
out of the equation,

15:41.941 --> 15:43.734
everything else that doesn't matter,

15:43.817 --> 15:46.028
you fall in love,
if it's the right person.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.448
Oh fuck.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.993
If he looks like,
I don't know, like an ogre,

15:53.077 --> 15:56.205
it wouldn't impact my love for him.

15:56.288 --> 16:00.042
And I know, you know,
it would be the same way for him.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.502
I hope so, at least.

16:01.585 --> 16:02.670
Holy shit.

16:02.753 --> 16:06.256
'Cause I'm just me,
just average little old me. So…

16:07.883 --> 16:09.677
This is so fucked. Yeah.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.222
Natalie is the perfect human being.
What she looks like doesn't matter to me.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.433
If she was missing a tooth,
then I'd probably run the other way,

16:16.517 --> 16:17.893
but like… You wouldn't?

16:18.435 --> 16:19.770
Oh my God.

16:19.853 --> 16:24.066
You know, you would run too.
Like, a missing tooth? Come on.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.987
I spent thousands on my teeth.
It's, like… I have limits.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.865
And a missing front tooth is
a limit for me. I can't do it.

16:49.717 --> 16:50.926
Oh my God.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.761
-Hi!

16:56.557 --> 16:58.017
Hi! Oh my gosh!

16:59.393 --> 17:00.686
Oh my goodness.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.650
When I was walking down and I saw Natalie,

17:06.734 --> 17:08.902
everything's sweating
like crazy and I'm like,

17:08.986 --> 17:11.363
"I gotta kiss her
before I start sweating all over."

17:23.751 --> 17:24.960
How are you?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.211
I'm better.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.630
-Yeah.
-I can't… Oh my gosh.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.508
I can't believe…

17:34.428 --> 17:38.474
So, again, will you marry me?

17:39.183 --> 17:42.019
Yeah, absolutely! Oh my gosh!

17:43.687 --> 17:44.605
Holy shit.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.067
It's so great. It's beautiful.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.360
You know what?
You are actually so beautiful.

17:58.535 --> 17:59.620
So.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.663
Oh my God.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.665
Oh my God. You… Oh my God.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.668
-You look so good. Stop.
-Should we dance a little bit?

18:06.752 --> 18:07.669
-Should we?
-Yeah.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.174
You're literally nothing
like I would've expected.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.675
-Why?
-But, like, everything.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.761
He's hot as F.

18:15.844 --> 18:21.767
I was surprised that he was suave
and confident and good-looking.

18:22.267 --> 18:26.188
He comes off so goofy.
So, I think in my head, I just thought of,

18:26.271 --> 18:29.650
you know, like the image
you'd associate with a goofy person.

18:29.733 --> 18:33.445
It's like a cherry on top that,
like, he's so good-looking.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.947
Anyways.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.699
Honestly, I'm just done talking right now.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.119
I just am so done talking.
You know, I go on--

18:48.335 --> 18:49.419
When he kissed me,

18:49.503 --> 18:51.839
it was probably
the best moment of my life.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.049
I've kissed boys, but, like,

18:54.133 --> 18:57.177
I think because there was a love there,
it feels so different.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.304
What'll we do
when we first see each other?

18:59.388 --> 19:01.223
I think you know what we'll do.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.474
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

19:02.558 --> 19:07.020
Honey! Little sassy.
Are we going to tickle a little bit?

19:08.605 --> 19:11.900
It feels so right and so good.
And it feels electric.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.277
-All right, one more.
-Okay, bye.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.405
-All right, bye!
-Bye, love you!

19:20.492 --> 19:23.120
Natalie has exceeded every expectation
I've had in my life.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.873
<i>Everything </i>that I ever wanted in a wife.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.422
Seeing that smile, she has
the most beautiful smile in the world,

19:34.006 --> 19:37.134
and hearing her voice
just makes me feel so at home.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.635
Oh my God.

19:39.469 --> 19:42.848
God, I wish everyone
could experience the feeling I'm feeling.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.184
I came here to find a wife.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.478
I cannot wait
to make it official with her.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.397
Oh my God.

19:52.065 --> 19:55.903
Meeting Shayne today,
it absolutely was the best day of my life.

19:57.321 --> 20:01.950
I can't wait to see him again and spend
the next chapter of our lives together.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.870
A thousand chapters of our lives together.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.289
Feel so--

20:07.789 --> 20:11.668
Now, we have to figure out
how do we work as a couple

20:12.169 --> 20:15.255
in the real world,
where there are distractions

20:15.339 --> 20:18.050
and meeting my parents…

20:19.301 --> 20:20.510
Um, hmm.

20:21.136 --> 20:25.224
That's gonna be interesting.
But I just love the way I feel right now.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.558
Oh my God.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.854
I'm so confident in us, and I'm so excited

20:30.938 --> 20:35.567
for our marriage
and everything else that's about to come.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.547
My stomach's definitely turning right now.
It's turning.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.801
Mallory had also told me
that she was dating other people,

21:00.884 --> 21:03.136
which is fine.
That's what we're all here to do.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.640
But it was like a punch to the gut,
a really big punch to the gut.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.100
I was definitely taken aback.

21:09.559 --> 21:13.730
I know that I was dating two women.
I had strong connection with both women.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.691
You know, I could have went either way

21:15.774 --> 21:18.610
and I think that's why every day,
I was kind of flipping sides.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.195
Like, today, it might be Mallory.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.781
Tomorrow it might be Iyanna,
and vice versa.

21:23.448 --> 21:26.118
Iyanna is truly there for me
and loves me for me.

21:26.201 --> 21:29.079
If she's still in,
I can see myself proposing to her too,

21:29.162 --> 21:31.957
because a day ago,
I was on the fence of who I was choosing

21:32.040 --> 21:34.960
between Iyanna and Mallory.
I'm trying to gather my thoughts

21:35.043 --> 21:37.045
on how to have
this conversation with Iyanna.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.173
So I'm just all over the place right now.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.676
I look like I'm keeping it together,
but I'm all over.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.772
-Hello.
-Hello.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.733
Hello, hello, hello.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.236
-What's up?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.071
What it do, baby?

22:05.407 --> 22:07.409
You sound low energy. What's up?

22:09.077 --> 22:12.247
-Something I need to talk to you about.
-Okay.

22:17.252 --> 22:18.503
What?

22:19.546 --> 22:21.340
Just trying to find the words.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.721
Obviously, I've been,
you know, dating you and--

22:27.804 --> 22:30.015
And 14 other women. I know.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.601
But I know you've had
a connection with Mallory.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.145
Yeah. I had a strong bond
with both of y'all.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.773
I've literally been going
back and forth every day.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.985
And so, I did…
I had a date with Mallory earlier.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.905
And I, like, asked a question.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.701
"If I was to propose to you,
how would you feel?"

22:50.410 --> 22:53.538
You know, and she pretty much told me,
like, our connection is cool,

22:53.622 --> 22:56.625
our connection is strong,
but I feel strongly about someone else.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.128
I didn't get the response that I wanted,
you know.

23:03.048 --> 23:08.095
I also don't want you to feel like you're
second fiddle because I still envision

23:08.178 --> 23:10.055
what marriage would be like with you.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.439
I was so sure
that I wanted to be with you.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.403
I can't help but to think, like,

23:24.486 --> 23:28.281
if Mallory had said yes,
that you would have proposed to her,

23:28.365 --> 23:30.575
and I don't know how I feel about that.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.787
I mean, my feelings
for you don't just subside in…

23:33.870 --> 23:36.289
-I know that. But…
-…a couple of hours.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.877
…I deserve someone
who wants to be certain about me.

23:40.961 --> 23:44.131
Kinda feel like this whole process
is all uncertainty,

23:44.214 --> 23:47.717
and I feel like that's why I was going
back and forth every day.

23:47.801 --> 23:51.138
I think her telling me no, just really

23:51.638 --> 23:54.015
kind of just gives me my validation
that I needed.

23:54.099 --> 23:58.353
You know, because I was-- I knew
that I can see myself with both of y'all.

23:58.437 --> 24:02.524
And I think her telling me no, it just…
It makes my decision easier.

24:10.949 --> 24:16.079
Do you feel strongly enough
about me to propose?

24:18.373 --> 24:19.207
Yes.

24:23.670 --> 24:26.756
My heart just feels torn,

24:27.716 --> 24:29.551
because I don't… I don't know.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.975
If she had said yes,

24:37.517 --> 24:40.437
do you think
that was all you needed to propose?

24:43.440 --> 24:44.274
Um…

24:48.361 --> 24:50.113
Like, it would have…

24:50.197 --> 24:52.324
Honestly, I just would've…
It would've been a…

24:57.996 --> 24:59.039
I don't know.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.427


25:58.390 --> 25:59.724
I'm terrified.

26:00.475 --> 26:02.727
I never wanna feel
like someone's second choice.

26:03.228 --> 26:06.898
Yes, I am strong,
but I am very fragile at the same time.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.886
Okay.

26:48.607 --> 26:52.277
When I came here, I did not
expect to find someone like Mallory.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.738
She just reminds me so much of home.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.239
I found my best friend.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.783
I am in love with Mallory.

26:59.534 --> 27:03.121
I feel like I've always been
so careful with that word.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.670
This is new territory for me,

27:11.630 --> 27:13.173
but I am in love with her.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.468
Man…

27:25.143 --> 27:27.145
-Hello.
-Hey.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.229
Hey.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.941
-How are you?
-I'm pretty good. How are you?

27:32.025 --> 27:34.611
I'm really good. Yeah.

27:35.195 --> 27:39.491
I, like, play this in my head, uh…

27:39.574 --> 27:40.825
a lot of times.

27:41.451 --> 27:45.747
-Mm-hmm.
-I, um, remember our first date.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.333
And how I felt afterward.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.753
I drew two little stars
and a pepper next to your name.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.463
-That's so funny.

27:54.756 --> 27:59.302
I remember you just sharing with me
how much you cared about your family

27:59.386 --> 28:03.556
and the value that they hold
in your life, you know,

28:04.140 --> 28:06.351
and that really meant so much to me.

28:08.937 --> 28:12.774
I know that you will take
nothing more than my best.

28:13.441 --> 28:14.859
And I love how you bring out

28:14.943 --> 28:17.862
my most thoughtful,
my most vulnerable version,

28:18.363 --> 28:20.949
because you deserve nothing less.
You deserve that.

28:22.325 --> 28:25.495
You literally have, like,
my best in your hands right now,

28:25.578 --> 28:30.750
and falling in love with you
has changed me as a person.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.172
Mallory.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.551
Will you marry me?

28:41.136 --> 28:42.721
Oh my God.

28:46.182 --> 28:48.727
You kind of scared me a little bit,

28:48.810 --> 28:49.644
'cause…

28:52.897 --> 28:53.773
Why, Mal?

28:55.024 --> 28:57.193
Because I was afraid to

28:58.778 --> 29:00.405
be emotionally available.

29:00.488 --> 29:02.073
Yeah. Yeah.

29:02.157 --> 29:06.161
But I don't want to run from that anymore.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.122
Yes, I will marry you.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.207
I will.

29:19.924 --> 29:20.842
Oh my God.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.514
-Oh my God.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.937
-Oh my God.
-Did you get on one knee?

29:33.438 --> 29:35.106
-I did.
-Oh my God.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.941
Still on one.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.359
Holy fuck.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.905
Oh my God.
I just wanna hug you and kiss you.

29:41.988 --> 29:43.323
Me too. Me too.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.991
I'm so excited.

29:46.951 --> 29:50.872
When I see you tomorrow, can I kiss you?

29:50.955 --> 29:53.208
Yes, you can.

29:57.504 --> 29:58.671
Fuck.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.216
What the fuck?

30:01.758 --> 30:02.717


30:02.801 --> 30:04.344
Yeah, I'm engaged.

30:06.262 --> 30:07.180
Yeah.

30:17.899 --> 30:20.568
I fell in love with Shaina through a wall,

30:21.152 --> 30:24.656
and now I'm gonna go pick her up,

30:24.739 --> 30:26.157
give her a kiss.

30:27.909 --> 30:30.203
Maybe. Or I get punched in the face

30:30.787 --> 30:32.247
for all the Bible jokes.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.419
Coming to this experiment

30:38.503 --> 30:41.673
has definitely been
a life-changing experience.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.343
It's just been a lot.
I just got engaged to a man,

30:45.426 --> 30:48.638
and then told another man
I had feelings for him the whole time,

30:48.721 --> 30:52.141
but never really was clear
or transparent with him.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.894
I'm all of a sudden talking
about the man I'm engaged to,

30:54.978 --> 30:57.146
even though we have
all these huge differences.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.649
I'm just like… It's been crazy.

30:59.732 --> 31:00.817
Oh my God.

31:06.155 --> 31:10.410
I'm concerned
that she's gonna have hesitations

31:10.493 --> 31:11.995
based off my appearance,

31:12.829 --> 31:13.872
or my bad breath.

31:15.498 --> 31:19.419
She loves that I have a physical job
and that I work with my hands.

31:19.502 --> 31:22.088
She likes a masculine man.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.841
That's why I grew out my beard.

31:26.092 --> 31:30.305
I just… I'm confident
that her and I will physically

31:31.139 --> 31:32.682
be perfect for each other.

31:33.182 --> 31:36.019
I don't know why.
It's just the feeling that I have.

31:36.102 --> 31:40.106
That's just how I feel.
I just think we've bonded over everything.

31:40.189 --> 31:43.776
Man, I'm shaking over here.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.824
Me seeing Kyle,
I think it will give me clarity.

31:49.908 --> 31:54.454
I have to feel him, I have to touch him,
I have to see him, so it is real.

31:54.537 --> 31:57.665
I think it will give me that

31:58.750 --> 32:01.002
reassurance and calmness.

32:01.085 --> 32:05.173
When I see him,
I think I'm gonna know. I feel scared.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.905
Oh my God.

32:31.574 --> 32:33.284
You. Look at you.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.786
How are you?

32:35.745 --> 32:36.704
Oh my God.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.009
I see her and I'm like,

32:50.093 --> 32:53.304
"Shit. I'm a slouch.
Way out of my league."

32:53.388 --> 32:55.974
Imagine you're standing
next to a supermodel.

32:56.057 --> 32:59.435
You're, like… You're gonna feel
like a piece of shit. That's how I felt.

33:00.269 --> 33:03.147
She told me she doesn't care how I look,

33:03.648 --> 33:06.943
but she puts a lot of effort
into how she looks.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.528
Oh my God.

33:09.487 --> 33:10.905
Your fucking smile.

33:10.989 --> 33:14.784
-Oh my God.
-You… are gorgeous!

33:14.867 --> 33:16.828
Thank you. So are you.

33:20.707 --> 33:21.708
Oh.

33:23.376 --> 33:25.586
-I'm, like, shaking.
-Oh my God.

33:25.670 --> 33:29.465
-Oh my God, you're… Oh my…
-You're so sweet.

33:29.549 --> 33:32.385
-You're a lot nicer in person.
-I know.

33:36.305 --> 33:38.349
I'm just, like, soaking it all in.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.727
-Yeah. So is my shirt.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.478
You're making me sweat over here.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.022
-You're hot.
-Yeah.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.442
Yeah.

33:48.609 --> 33:51.154
I'm so
physically attracted to her.

33:51.654 --> 33:52.488
It's crazy.

33:52.572 --> 33:58.703
Her being that attractive and sexy
and pretty and cute is all a bonus

33:59.537 --> 34:01.539
to what I already loved about her.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.458
No, it's crazy.

34:05.752 --> 34:06.711
Now what?

34:06.794 --> 34:08.004
Um…

34:10.048 --> 34:12.258
This engagement, um…

34:13.342 --> 34:17.722
I'm scared that, like,
given our differences and everything…

34:17.805 --> 34:20.099
-Mm-hmm.
-…if it's gonna be a problem.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.771
And so, I'm just, like, freaking out.

34:25.938 --> 34:26.814
About what?

34:26.898 --> 34:29.358
I don't wanna make a mistake,
and I don't want you to.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.778
I don't want us getting caught up
in the excitement.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.113
But are you willing to try?

34:36.365 --> 34:37.200
Um…

34:37.909 --> 34:39.619
Are you willing to give it a try?

34:43.623 --> 34:46.209
Part of me is like, "Go for it,"

34:46.292 --> 34:49.712
and another half is like, "Be wise here."

34:49.796 --> 34:52.090
You know it's for the best
not to go there,

34:52.173 --> 34:53.925
because it could be a beautiful thing,

34:54.008 --> 34:56.761
or it can be very combative
and it could get toxic and ugly.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.179
-Yeah.
-And I don't want that.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.138
-Right.
-At all.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.056
Right.

35:01.766 --> 35:02.934
I'm crazy about you.

35:03.017 --> 35:06.562
I'd have so much fun with you and it'd be
such an amazing adventure with you.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.731
-And I don't know what to do.
-Yeah. Yeah.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.526
-I'm just being 100% transparent with you.
-Yeah.

35:11.609 --> 35:14.278
Well, we're gonna have to make an effort.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.157
-Have some hope.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.879
I was kind of taken aback,

35:31.963 --> 35:35.925
because her and I seemed
very confident going into this.

35:36.509 --> 35:40.012
And I think that she wanted
to tell me in person that,

35:40.596 --> 35:44.725
like, "You're amazing,
<i>but</i> don't think that it's all

35:45.560 --> 35:47.770
fairy tales and rainbows from here."

35:58.156 --> 36:02.076
The connection
that Shaina and I have is… is incredible.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.078
I can't even explain it.

36:04.162 --> 36:09.083
After all the things we've talked about
and all the shit we went through,

36:09.167 --> 36:11.919
I think it will be impossible
to pull us apart.

36:13.379 --> 36:16.132
I'm <i>confident</i> that we will get married.

36:16.215 --> 36:17.717
It's just going to be

36:18.217 --> 36:21.220
an interesting journey there.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.531
-I want it to stop.
-What did you say you feel?

36:40.615 --> 36:44.619
Anxious. So, I'm gonna go in
and I'm just gonna be super transparent.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.538
I don't know how she'll react.
Gonna put it out there, man.

36:47.622 --> 36:48.748
-I love you.
-I love you too.

37:03.971 --> 37:05.932
This experiment
has been unreal.

37:06.015 --> 37:10.186
I'm like, there's no fucking way
that these people are falling in love

37:10.269 --> 37:12.772
and being married
within this short amount of time.

37:12.855 --> 37:17.068
There's no way.
But now, I 100% see how it's possible.

37:17.151 --> 37:19.195
I don't even think
I could put it in words.

37:20.154 --> 37:24.784
Like, I did fall in love in the pods,
and this is my first time saying it.

37:24.867 --> 37:25.743
Wow.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.497
-Hello?
-Hello.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.458
How are you?

37:36.128 --> 37:39.131
I am overwhelmed.

37:39.966 --> 37:44.011
Yesterday's situation kind of fed into
one of my worst insecurities and, like,

37:44.095 --> 37:46.973
I knew how certain I was
about you days ago.

37:48.307 --> 37:51.852
I just… It scares me that
you weren't so certain about me.

37:53.896 --> 37:56.607
I was literally
just going through the process.

37:58.359 --> 38:01.404
I've done things
a little unorthodox doing this, you know.

38:02.071 --> 38:05.825
But I came in with an open mind,
with an open heart,

38:05.908 --> 38:08.953
telling myself that if I make
a strong-ass connection with someone,

38:09.036 --> 38:11.163
then I would take that leap of faith.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.375
We've had a lot of deep,
thought-provoking conversations

38:14.458 --> 38:19.130
and the biggest thing that I value
and like about you is your strength.

38:19.714 --> 38:23.509
You've been dealt some…
some crazy-ass hands in life.

38:23.592 --> 38:26.762
You've proven time and time again
at every obstacle in your way,

38:26.846 --> 38:29.140
everything thrown your way,
you've powered through,

38:29.223 --> 38:33.602
and that just goes to show,
you know, the testament of your character.

38:35.688 --> 38:36.647
Um…

38:37.815 --> 38:40.484
I had a long talk
with God this morning and…

38:43.029 --> 38:44.697
Listen.

38:45.698 --> 38:46.907
Um…

38:47.950 --> 38:48.868
Iyanna…

38:54.332 --> 38:55.666
Will you marry me?

39:05.676 --> 39:06.594
I…

39:07.136 --> 39:08.054
Um…

39:09.055 --> 39:10.097
Um…

39:11.515 --> 39:13.059
That…

39:15.519 --> 39:17.897
That is not what I expected you to say.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.945
You have no hesitations?

39:25.446 --> 39:28.741
I wouldn't be standing right here
asking you to marry me if I did.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.705
I'll be honest. Like, I'm really scared.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.707
I'm like, really, really scared.

39:45.132 --> 39:48.260
I mean, love is scary.
But, you know, I feel like I have enough.

39:48.344 --> 39:51.430
I know what I need to know
to know that this can be successful.

39:52.681 --> 39:53.849
Are you sure?

39:53.933 --> 39:55.142
I'm positive.

39:58.437 --> 39:59.939
I got you and you got me.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.576
Yeah. Yeah.

40:13.786 --> 40:14.829
Yeah, what?

40:17.415 --> 40:20.501
Yeah, I'll marry you.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.336
Let's go!

40:24.755 --> 40:26.799
Let's go!

40:27.925 --> 40:31.470
What the fuck?
What is wrong with us? This is crazy!

40:32.096 --> 40:34.640
-Oh my God.

40:36.058 --> 40:38.519
What just happened?

40:38.602 --> 40:40.146
Oh God!

40:40.980 --> 40:43.357
Part of me feels like,
"Iyanna, what the fuck? Run!"

40:43.441 --> 40:46.777
and then the other part is like,
"Wait a second. This is what you wanted."

40:46.861 --> 40:49.989
This is not how I ever envisioned
getting proposed to.

40:51.490 --> 40:54.618
We're on bended knee through a wall.

40:54.702 --> 40:56.370
We're some weirdos.

40:56.996 --> 40:59.290
Listen, we're gonna be
weird together, forever.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.676
Fuck!

41:10.759 --> 41:14.096
What the fuck just happened?
What the fuck just happened?!

41:14.180 --> 41:15.055
Oh God!

41:15.139 --> 41:16.348
I'm freaking out!

41:16.432 --> 41:17.850
She fucking said yes!

41:32.531 --> 41:34.575
Oh my…

41:39.622 --> 41:43.417
I'm so excited to meet Sal
and to explore that relationship,

41:43.501 --> 41:46.712
but, man, I'm fucking proud of myself.

41:47.296 --> 41:48.923
Ah, this is so nerve-racking.

41:49.423 --> 41:53.552
I think sometimes I've lacked confidence
in so many areas of my life,

41:54.136 --> 41:55.054
and…

41:57.556 --> 41:59.058
…I don't know why.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.809
Why am I so nervous?

42:01.310 --> 42:05.981
But… I'm really happy about who I am,

42:06.857 --> 42:10.194
and I hope my parents are really proud
about who they raised.

42:10.277 --> 42:15.115
And I'm so confident
in myself and my decisions,

42:15.741 --> 42:18.494
and that includes this whole experiment

42:18.577 --> 42:21.121
and my relationship with Sal.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.499
Oh my God.

42:23.582 --> 42:26.835
He's just so thoughtful and considerate,

42:26.919 --> 42:31.924
and I fully deserve
and embrace that type of love from Sal,

42:32.007 --> 42:34.510
and I wouldn't have realized that

42:34.593 --> 42:37.638
if I didn't go through
this experiment with him.

42:44.186 --> 42:48.232
Love is really blind, you know,
because this love is unconditional.

42:49.066 --> 42:52.403
I don't know what she looks like,
but I've never felt as deep a connection

42:52.486 --> 42:54.947
as I have with Mallory,
and I am very attracted to her.

42:55.030 --> 42:56.824
And I can't wait.

42:57.908 --> 42:58.742
I can't wait.

43:03.539 --> 43:07.042
Holy shit. Should have taken a shot.

43:10.754 --> 43:13.257
My head initially goes to,
"What if he doesn't like me?"

43:13.340 --> 43:15.759
"What if there's something
he doesn't find attractive?"

43:15.843 --> 43:19.680
Like the big scar on my knee?
Like the blemishes that I have.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.266
Oh my God.

43:22.349 --> 43:25.477
I don't know. Like, it's scary.

43:25.561 --> 43:26.937
Okay.

43:31.734 --> 43:34.737
I have my insecurities
just like any other person.

43:36.488 --> 43:40.784
Those thoughts like, "Am I good enough?
Am I good enough for this person?"

43:47.625 --> 43:48.709
Oh my God.

44:01.138 --> 44:02.431
Oh my God.

44:02.514 --> 44:04.391
Hi!

44:06.310 --> 44:08.103
It's nice to see you in person.

44:08.187 --> 44:10.898
-Oh my God.
-Hi! Hi, how are you?

44:17.029 --> 44:19.156
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

44:19.239 --> 44:20.074
Good.

44:22.242 --> 44:23.577
This is crazy.

44:24.745 --> 44:27.623
-I don't know what to do now.
-Why don't you and me…

44:27.706 --> 44:30.751
-You wanna come over here at my side and…
-Sure.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.672
Oh my God.

44:35.381 --> 44:38.759
-It's so good to see you.
-It's so good to see you.

44:43.639 --> 44:46.350
-How do you feel?
-I feel amazing.

44:46.433 --> 44:47.810
-Yeah?
-You look great.

44:49.144 --> 44:51.480
-And I'm excited to be here with you.
-Yeah, same.

44:51.563 --> 44:55.275
-And finally get to see you.
-Yeah, same. Did you picture, like…

44:55.359 --> 44:58.028
-Not at all. Not at all.
-What? No? No?

44:58.112 --> 44:59.947
But, oh my gosh,

45:00.489 --> 45:01.949
you are beautiful, Mal.

45:02.449 --> 45:05.452
Are you ready for the… the next part?

45:05.536 --> 45:08.288
Mm-hmm. I'm ready. What are you feeling?

45:10.457 --> 45:14.086
-Excited and scared.
-I just want you to know I'm here.

45:14.586 --> 45:17.840
And I know this is scary.
I know this is really new,

45:17.923 --> 45:20.551
but I'm ready to face this with you, Mal.
I'm here for you.

45:20.634 --> 45:22.177
-Yeah.

45:22.261 --> 45:23.929
-Same.
-Get over here.

45:33.689 --> 45:35.733
I hope she liked me.

45:35.816 --> 45:38.110
I was trying to kiss her
a little bit more, but I…

45:38.193 --> 45:40.279
I'm just… I don't know.

45:40.362 --> 45:43.866
The physical can grow and it will.

45:43.949 --> 45:47.202
It will, and I'm just excited
to see her again.

45:51.498 --> 45:53.584
I'm definitely in my head.

45:53.667 --> 45:56.628
I'm very attracted to him emotionally,

45:56.712 --> 45:58.464
but physically, like,

45:58.964 --> 46:01.133
I don't really… I don't know.

46:01.216 --> 46:02.217
There's no…

46:02.301 --> 46:05.012
There's nothing wrong with him. It's just…

46:05.095 --> 46:09.725
It's not something
I can really put my finger on, I guess.

46:11.643 --> 46:14.730
I don't know. I…
This is, like, throwing me off,

46:14.813 --> 46:17.316
'cause now I'm not feeling good about it.

46:17.399 --> 46:19.818
And I was feeling really good about it.

46:21.737 --> 46:22.821
See you after.

46:28.702 --> 46:30.204
Oh my God.

46:36.335 --> 46:37.377
Oh my God.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.854
Oh my God.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.357
Oh. Just breathe.

46:58.440 --> 46:59.858
Just breathe.

47:00.526 --> 47:03.445
I know how broken he was
when Mallory said no,

47:03.529 --> 47:06.990
but he's not the only one
who was torn between two people.

47:09.117 --> 47:11.745
I found my fiancé.

47:15.332 --> 47:18.085
I know that Iyanna loves me
for who I am on the inside.

47:18.168 --> 47:20.337
I don't think she cares
about what I look like.

47:21.255 --> 47:23.966
I'm gonna be happy as hell.
Whatever she is or looks like,

47:24.049 --> 47:25.843
I'll be happy and I just can't wait.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.847
Oh fuck.

47:32.266 --> 47:34.518
Oh my God.

47:37.604 --> 47:38.522
Oh God.

47:48.407 --> 47:49.825
Okay. Lord, help me.

47:56.623 --> 47:58.667
Oh God!

48:04.298 --> 48:06.466
-Hi, Jarrette.
-Oh my God.

48:06.967 --> 48:08.635
What's up, babe?

48:10.596 --> 48:13.932
-Oh my God. What?
-Hi!

48:14.433 --> 48:16.476
-Oh, this is weird.

48:18.562 --> 48:19.396
Mmm.

48:28.363 --> 48:29.448
Hey, baby.

48:31.241 --> 48:32.409
Can you breathe?

48:32.492 --> 48:34.161
A little bit. Barely.

48:34.745 --> 48:39.291
Whoo. Man, oh, man.
She's fucking beautiful.

48:39.374 --> 48:42.711
Like, she just fits like a glove
when I hug her.

48:42.794 --> 48:44.713
I didn't expect her to look like that.

48:44.796 --> 48:46.798
Her voice does not match
what she looks like.

48:46.882 --> 48:49.051
But I'm happy as hell.

48:52.721 --> 48:53.555
Wow.

48:53.639 --> 48:55.724
Listen, I got something for you.

48:55.807 --> 48:58.352
-You ready? Are you sure?
-Uh-oh.

49:01.104 --> 49:02.773
-Are you sure?

49:03.899 --> 49:06.026
Oh, you picked a good one.

49:06.109 --> 49:08.612
Babe! This is adorab--

49:08.695 --> 49:10.030
Oh God.

49:10.113 --> 49:12.199
And it matches my dress.

49:14.368 --> 49:15.744
Oh my God.

49:22.167 --> 49:23.418
You disappointed?

49:23.502 --> 49:24.836
-No, not at all.
-You sure?

49:24.920 --> 49:26.421
-I promise.
-Are you sure?

49:26.505 --> 49:27.631
I promise.

49:27.714 --> 49:32.177
He has a big head, so I'm a little nervous
for my cervix, but he's so cute!

49:38.183 --> 49:40.227
And you smell so good!

49:42.396 --> 49:44.815
I can still smell him. Sorry.

49:45.649 --> 49:48.318
Like, I don't know.
I have to keep this dress forever.

49:48.402 --> 49:49.653
This is an important dress.

49:50.696 --> 49:51.947
Oh my.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.783
Oh my God.

49:54.866 --> 49:57.119
-All right.
-Oh my God.

49:57.202 --> 50:00.330
-Stop shakin'.
-I can't. I literally can't.

50:00.831 --> 50:04.042
-'Cause I'mma start getting too weird.
-Oh my God. It looks really good.

50:04.126 --> 50:06.086
-Did this pick this all by yourself?
-I did.

50:06.169 --> 50:07.754
-All by yourself?
-I did.

50:08.255 --> 50:10.841
Hey, good taste. Okay, good taste.

50:10.924 --> 50:14.678
Come on.
Oh yeah, come on. Uh-huh.

50:14.761 --> 50:16.179
Stop…

50:16.263 --> 50:18.640
This is so pretty. You did a good job.

50:18.724 --> 50:21.435
-Oh my God. Come here.

50:28.734 --> 50:31.653
The rest of the world,
they won't understand, but, like,

50:31.737 --> 50:32.779
it's my life, you know,

50:32.863 --> 50:35.490
and my heart is telling me
that Iyanna's the one for me.

50:35.574 --> 50:36.616
Mmm.

50:36.700 --> 50:40.537
It's not for anyone else to understand.
It's for me, my feelings, and my fiancée.

50:40.620 --> 50:43.373
That's all that matters.
I'm the one that's getting married.

50:43.957 --> 50:46.668
-You're so cute!

50:49.296 --> 50:50.547
Oh my God!

51:03.727 --> 51:04.561
Yes!

51:15.906 --> 51:18.408


51:22.537 --> 51:24.956
Six couples fell in love and got engaged,

51:25.040 --> 51:26.625
sight unseen.

51:28.710 --> 51:29.753
Oh my God!

51:31.588 --> 51:32.547
Hi. How are you?

51:33.173 --> 51:34.966
-What's up, babe?

51:35.050 --> 51:37.511
After finally seeing each other
for the very first time,

51:37.594 --> 51:40.013
they're now with us in Mexico
for a romantic getaway.

51:40.097 --> 51:42.557
Here, they'll discover
if their physical connection

51:42.641 --> 51:44.351
is as strong as their emotional one.

51:49.731 --> 51:53.110
Until this point, only thing that's
mattered is who they are on the inside.

51:53.193 --> 51:55.153
Now their love will be put to the test.

51:55.737 --> 51:59.199
Will their looks, background
and insecurities of the real world

51:59.282 --> 52:01.284
be too much for them to overcome?

52:01.368 --> 52:05.622
-Their weddings are just four weeks away.
-Will love be enough?

52:13.547 --> 52:15.590
Don't look.
I was supposed to get a pedicure.

52:15.674 --> 52:17.134
I could give a shit.

52:17.217 --> 52:19.010
-I do care about myself.
-I don't care…

52:19.094 --> 52:21.972
Like, I wouldn't care
if you didn't have any nails.

52:22.055 --> 52:23.390
Your hair is amazing.

52:23.473 --> 52:26.017
-It's not the greatest today.
-What, the humidity?

52:26.101 --> 52:28.019
What's your natural hair color?

52:28.103 --> 52:30.397
Naturally, I'm a dark dirty blonde.

52:30.480 --> 52:31.731
So, that ring…

52:32.440 --> 52:35.318
-Love it. It's beautiful. Can I be honest?
-What?

52:35.402 --> 52:37.737
I'm shocked that your mom let me wear it.

52:37.821 --> 52:39.573
-Don't tell her. She doesn't know.

52:39.656 --> 52:42.075
I didn't wanna lose it.
I've been wearing it as a thumb ring.

52:42.159 --> 52:45.162
-I don't want you to feel like--
-What do you mean? Feel like what?

52:45.245 --> 52:46.913
Like we didn't get our own ring.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.707
-I don't care.
-But we will get it.

52:48.790 --> 52:49.708
I don't care.

52:49.791 --> 52:51.835
We'll get it, is what I was gonna say.

52:51.918 --> 52:53.587
Isn't that funny? I don't care.

52:53.670 --> 52:56.047
I thought my ring was prettier
than everybody's.

52:56.131 --> 52:57.632
It's unique and old.

52:57.716 --> 52:59.885
That's why I like…
I'm unique and I'm old… er.

53:01.052 --> 53:03.263
You're right. I forgot.

53:03.930 --> 53:04.890
You're a baby.

53:05.974 --> 53:09.436
I'll whip you into shape.
It's okay. Like a training process.

53:15.025 --> 53:17.110
-I love when you touch me.
-Oh yeah?

53:22.866 --> 53:25.660
I was questioning it at first.
Like, do I find him attractive?

53:25.744 --> 53:28.413
But I'm like, I am so in it with him.

53:28.496 --> 53:31.625
Like, to finally see him physically

53:31.708 --> 53:36.338
and, like, how he walked,
how he ate food, how he drank,

53:36.421 --> 53:38.632
how he just interacted with me.

53:38.715 --> 53:43.136
I just found him
so physically attractive and I'm just… Oh!

53:43.220 --> 53:46.056
Just all the emotions. I'm here for it.

53:51.686 --> 53:53.355
-Come over here.
-Oh my God.

53:53.438 --> 53:56.024
-You're so cute!
-You're so cute.

53:56.107 --> 53:57.025
I, like,

53:57.108 --> 54:01.613
literally never have I just been so… good.

54:02.364 --> 54:04.491
I've never felt so just, like, calm,

54:04.574 --> 54:08.328
and so sure everything's gonna be fine.
No, we're definitely getting married.

54:08.411 --> 54:10.121
I just wanna have babies with him.

54:12.415 --> 54:13.792
Literally, I do.

54:19.005 --> 54:20.799
I could kiss you all day,
I'm cool with it.

54:20.882 --> 54:21.716
Yeah?

54:30.016 --> 54:31.768
I'm so pumped for this.

54:31.851 --> 54:34.104
This at night's gonna be
so fucking awesome.

54:34.187 --> 54:36.606
I love this.
Okay, what do you wanna do here?

54:36.690 --> 54:38.858
-I want-- Well, you know what. I mean…
-What?

54:38.942 --> 54:42.570
These two rooms are probably perfect.
And then the hot tub.

54:43.071 --> 54:45.073
-That's not happening.

54:45.615 --> 54:48.076
-You-- It's my birthday.
-No, fuck that.

54:48.159 --> 54:49.035
It's my birthday.

54:49.119 --> 54:52.622
I can use that excuse for at least
the next ten hours, I think, so…

54:53.206 --> 54:57.210
-I'm fucking outta here. I'm just kidding.
-Oh my God.

54:59.004 --> 55:00.672
Did you get me a present?

55:01.172 --> 55:04.301
-You'll just have to see tonight.
-Ooh…

55:06.136 --> 55:09.055
-What do you say?
-Say what? Fucking pour me.

55:09.139 --> 55:11.057
-What do you say?
-What?

55:11.141 --> 55:12.642
-I need a little--
-Oh. Please?

55:12.726 --> 55:14.811
-Something else.
-Is that what you were saying?

55:14.894 --> 55:16.855
No, just something nice about me.

55:18.690 --> 55:20.567
Pour me, then I'll give you a compliment.

55:21.151 --> 55:24.321
That's a lie, but I'll allow it.
'Cause I'm a nice guy.

55:24.404 --> 55:27.782
-See? I'm not egotistical. I'm a nice guy.
-I think you're a piece of shit.

55:30.285 --> 55:33.663
-You're being a little mean.
-Really? You need words of affirmation?

55:33.747 --> 55:34.998
Yeah. Just…

55:35.832 --> 55:38.460
Okay, I think you're hot.
Here, does that help you?

55:38.543 --> 55:41.087
Yeah, that's the first nice thing
you've said about me.

55:41.171 --> 55:43.465
-I think you have really nice eyes.

55:45.133 --> 55:46.176
Oh my God.

55:46.259 --> 55:48.887
Natalie is absolutely gorgeous.
I think she's beautiful.

55:49.471 --> 55:51.681
Her style,
everything she's got going for her,

55:51.765 --> 55:53.516
that hasn't been a problem whatsoever.

55:53.600 --> 55:56.269
But communication's a little different
than the pod so far.

55:56.353 --> 55:59.105
I don't know if she's just nervous
and that's how she reacts

55:59.189 --> 56:03.818
a little bit to the situation,
but I wanted a little more affection.

56:03.902 --> 56:05.236
I'm flustered, I'm confused.

56:05.320 --> 56:07.238
I just don't understand what's going on.

56:22.754 --> 56:25.006
I have a weird thing to tell you.

56:25.090 --> 56:26.966
So, I've been making my own toothpaste.

56:27.050 --> 56:28.843
-Oh God. No.
-Bear with me.

56:28.927 --> 56:31.805
-I don't like that.
-Seven years. Seven years.

56:31.888 --> 56:33.556
-Out of what?
-I have great teeth.

56:34.140 --> 56:36.017
Baking soda, coconut oil,

56:36.101 --> 56:37.268
sometimes charcoal.

56:37.352 --> 56:38.895
Yeah, it's all natural.

56:38.978 --> 56:39.896
Can I smell it?

56:39.979 --> 56:43.483
Yeah. I put some peppermint essential oil
in there. It's great.

56:43.566 --> 56:45.402
-This is toothpaste to you?
-Correct.

56:49.697 --> 56:50.532
I'm just saying.

56:50.615 --> 56:53.993
-Does smell like toothpaste.
-I know it does. I know what I'm doing.

56:54.869 --> 56:55.787
All natural.

56:59.040 --> 56:59.916
All for you.

57:00.458 --> 57:02.919
-Oh, I have my own toothpaste.
-Just trust me now.

57:03.962 --> 57:06.256
-Trust me, I brought toothpaste.

57:06.339 --> 57:08.508
Smoothest teeth anybody's ever had.

57:09.342 --> 57:11.302
-Smooth?
-I don't get cavities.

57:12.053 --> 57:14.264
I've never been like,
"Wow. He has smooth teeth."

57:14.889 --> 57:19.144
Maybe you're not looking close enough.
I just brush until I feel good.

57:21.729 --> 57:23.648
Think it's weird I make my own toothpaste?

57:24.399 --> 57:27.110
-Yeah.
-Does it change your feelings about me?

57:28.319 --> 57:29.154
No.

57:30.155 --> 57:32.449
Okay, good. I make my own body wash too.

57:32.532 --> 57:34.075
That…

57:35.535 --> 57:37.036
…doesn't shock me at all.

57:37.537 --> 57:40.415
I'm a hippie. Low key. Secretly.

57:40.498 --> 57:42.417
I'm not. I'm the opposite.

57:46.296 --> 57:49.340
Everything natural.
It's the only way to go.

57:51.551 --> 57:54.137
I'm gonna switch out his toothpaste
with real stuff.

57:54.220 --> 57:57.182
There's no way he's gonna continue
with that. It tastes so bad.

57:57.265 --> 57:59.017
I don't know how his breath doesn't smell.

58:02.937 --> 58:04.939
-Don't watch me.
-What are you talking about?

58:05.023 --> 58:08.067
We're gonna get married. I'm gonna watch
you brush your teeth a lot.

58:20.079 --> 58:22.957
-Ready? I got a surprise for you.
-Kind of.

58:23.041 --> 58:24.501
-
-Dinner.

58:25.084 --> 58:28.463
-Wow, look at you. You little romantic.
-Shall we?

58:28.546 --> 58:30.089
Shall we? We shall.

58:30.590 --> 58:32.509
We have our respectable dishes.

58:34.052 --> 58:36.137
-Oh my gosh.
-Isn't it? Beautiful.

58:36.221 --> 58:38.932
-Wait, is yours vegetarian?
-Yeah. Go ahead. Cheers.

58:44.062 --> 58:48.483
I'm feeling very blessed and happy,

58:49.234 --> 58:51.486
but it's one of those feelings
where it's like,

58:51.569 --> 58:53.279
it's a little too good to be true.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.782
Are you pissed
that you're with a Christian?

58:55.865 --> 58:57.492
No, I don't even know what that is.

58:57.575 --> 58:59.827
-Yeah, I know you don't.
-You gotta teach me.

58:59.911 --> 59:00.787
Aww…

59:00.870 --> 59:04.207
-Listen, if you speak in…
-That's so cool!

59:04.749 --> 59:07.627
-Parables?
-Yeah, like, in pretty language.

59:07.710 --> 59:10.755
-Okay.
-And give great quotes, I am all ears.

59:10.838 --> 59:14.759
-What is yours? Eggplant?
-Yes. I'm so excited about it.

59:14.842 --> 59:17.345
-I'm actually jealous.
-We can share.

59:17.428 --> 59:20.848
-No! Do not do that.
-I'll eat it. I will eat it for you.

59:21.432 --> 59:24.060
It's our first night. I might as well.

59:24.727 --> 59:28.606
It's very sweet of you. Wait.
When's the last time you actually ate…?

59:28.690 --> 59:29.649
Eight years.

59:30.650 --> 59:31.484
Yeah.

59:32.110 --> 59:33.236
You're breaking it?

59:34.112 --> 59:36.948
-Just for you.
-Oh my God. Ew. You need to eat meat.

59:38.616 --> 59:40.952
We're gonna cut you a good piece.
Okay, ready?

59:41.035 --> 59:43.204
-Yeah. I want all the sauce.
-I want this.

59:43.288 --> 59:45.123
We're gonna make you a really good bite.

59:45.623 --> 59:48.084
I hate feeding people.
I think it's so cheesy.

59:48.167 --> 59:50.920
-Well… Too late.
-But I fed you. Says a lot.

59:53.006 --> 59:54.799
It's so good.

59:54.882 --> 59:56.092
It was meant to be.

59:56.175 --> 59:57.802
-Good.
-I'm dying to try the bread.

59:57.885 --> 59:59.345
-Eat it!
-I'm gonna.

59:59.429 --> 1:00:02.390
If you don't eat the bread,
it's gonna be really unattractive.

1:00:03.057 --> 1:00:05.560
Holy fuck. I'm always being tested.

1:00:06.311 --> 1:00:07.645
Eat it. You're a guy.

1:00:07.729 --> 1:00:10.189
A guy that doesn't eat the bread
is weird to me.

1:00:10.690 --> 1:00:13.109
When I first saw Kyle
it kind of scared me in a way.

1:00:13.192 --> 1:00:14.569
I'm like, oh my God, like…

1:00:15.653 --> 1:00:17.989
Do I want to have
the conversation with Kyle

1:00:18.072 --> 1:00:19.449
about our differences?

1:00:24.078 --> 1:00:25.038
Yes.

1:00:26.289 --> 1:00:27.582
No.

1:00:28.166 --> 1:00:30.168
-Are you gonna go shower?
-Yeah.

1:00:30.251 --> 1:00:33.046
I'm kidding. I'm gonna…
I'm just gonna chill.

1:00:33.129 --> 1:00:38.009
It's one of those things where it's like,
again, you're preparing for the worst,

1:00:38.801 --> 1:00:42.847
hoping for the best,
but you don't want to know the answer,

1:00:42.930 --> 1:00:44.349
but you know the answer.

1:00:49.312 --> 1:00:51.230
How was your shower? Do you feel better?

1:00:51.314 --> 1:00:53.107
-Hell yeah.
-Did you have a cold shower?

1:00:53.191 --> 1:00:56.277
Yeah, I left it at yours.
Should we go to bed?

1:00:56.778 --> 1:00:58.696
Um, yes, can we sit?

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:00.823
-You want me to sit?
-Sit. Sit, sit, sit.

1:01:00.907 --> 1:01:02.575
-All right.
-Um…

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:05.078
-Okay, I'd like to talk to you.
-Okay.

1:01:05.578 --> 1:01:08.247
I actually
am not used to setting boundaries.

1:01:08.331 --> 1:01:10.583
-But I want to do this the right way.
-What does that mean?

1:01:10.667 --> 1:01:12.293
-Again, I'm not--
-Normally what?

1:01:12.377 --> 1:01:14.629
No, I'm not used to
setting good boundaries.

1:01:14.712 --> 1:01:17.465
-And it usually ends up in disaster.
-Yeah.

1:01:17.965 --> 1:01:21.094
This is the first time
we're actually spending time together.

1:01:21.177 --> 1:01:24.305
-And I wanna do this the right way.
-Okay.

1:01:24.389 --> 1:01:27.058
Um, I'd think for the first night

1:01:27.141 --> 1:01:29.644
that we'd spend the night
in separate rooms.

1:01:34.524 --> 1:01:38.403
-How do you feel about that?
-I don't know. Like…

1:01:43.074 --> 1:01:46.119
-What, you don't trust me?
-No. Oh my God. No.

1:01:46.202 --> 1:01:47.370
Then what?

1:01:47.453 --> 1:01:49.997
-I just want to, you know, set boundaries.
-Yeah.

1:01:50.081 --> 1:01:54.210
-I know you're probably--
-No, I just thought it's more bonding…

1:01:54.794 --> 1:01:55.962
A hundred percent.

1:01:56.462 --> 1:01:58.673
-No pressure, but--
-No!

1:01:58.756 --> 1:02:01.050
I would never think that.
I wouldn't choose, like--

1:02:01.134 --> 1:02:03.177
But that's, like, the best time.

1:02:03.261 --> 1:02:04.470
It's like, be yourself.

1:02:04.554 --> 1:02:05.638
Right.

1:02:06.472 --> 1:02:07.306
You know?

1:02:07.390 --> 1:02:08.224
I know.

1:02:09.892 --> 1:02:10.727
So…

1:02:12.145 --> 1:02:13.813
But whatever you think.

1:02:13.896 --> 1:02:14.981
Are you angry?

1:02:15.481 --> 1:02:18.943
-No, but I didn't expect that.
-I know.

1:02:19.026 --> 1:02:20.486
I… I get it.

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:22.155
-Do you?
-So…

1:02:22.238 --> 1:02:25.908
-I'll see you tomorrow morning.
-You're gonna go to your room <i>now?</i>

1:02:27.326 --> 1:02:28.202
It's…

1:02:29.704 --> 1:02:33.166
-um, 7:40.
-Oh my God. It's early.

1:02:33.249 --> 1:02:34.667
Oh my God.

1:02:35.334 --> 1:02:37.754
-All right.
-See you tomorrow morning.

1:02:37.837 --> 1:02:38.671
Okay.

1:02:39.464 --> 1:02:40.631
Goodbye.

1:02:41.632 --> 1:02:42.717
Okay, bye.

1:03:00.693 --> 1:03:06.824
Everything that she was in the pods,
she's way more personable in person.

1:03:06.908 --> 1:03:10.703
She's so much more dynamic,
and has so much more personality.

1:03:10.787 --> 1:03:12.705
She's, like, unlike anyone else.

1:03:12.789 --> 1:03:15.249
She's like gold-plated dynamite.

1:03:15.833 --> 1:03:17.460
I'm… I can't believe it.

1:03:26.761 --> 1:03:29.222
At the end of the day,
I think that I'm the lucky one.

1:03:29.305 --> 1:03:30.556
I get to be with her.

1:03:32.517 --> 1:03:33.684
I'm very lucky.

1:03:46.948 --> 1:03:50.576
I feel we're both passionate about
what we believe in and not gonna change.

1:03:51.994 --> 1:03:55.706
I feel like I do know
in my head what I should do.

1:03:56.290 --> 1:03:58.501
I can leave Mexico being a single woman.

1:04:00.586 --> 1:04:02.964
The way I felt about Shayne,

1:04:03.047 --> 1:04:04.465
like, back in the pods,

1:04:04.549 --> 1:04:07.635
that's in the back of my head
at the end of the day. Like, it…

1:04:07.718 --> 1:04:08.928
It's not going away.
