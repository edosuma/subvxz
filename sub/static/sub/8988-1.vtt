00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

01:02.896 --> 01:04.328
Is everything all right?

01:05.498 --> 01:08.865
It would be fine if you
weren't breathing down my neck.

01:08.935 --> 01:11.096
Next time you eat garlic,

01:11.171 --> 01:14.265
please do it after the robbery,
thank you very much.

01:20.113 --> 01:21.273
<i>D'accord.</i>

02:02.922 --> 02:04.082
What did I tell you?

02:04.257 --> 02:05.986
What did I tell you?

02:06.059 --> 02:09.550
You have to make sure
the shit works, okay?

02:37.757 --> 02:39.554
Who are your partners?

02:39.626 --> 02:41.719
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

02:41.794 --> 02:44.991
Are you telling me you don't know
who you're working with?

02:45.064 --> 02:46.429
I don't know.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.729
How long were you
planning this heist?

02:51.838 --> 02:53.430
I don't know.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.066
Are you the one who tried
to rob the Salome statues

02:56.142 --> 02:57.973
six months ago in Rome?

02:59.212 --> 03:00.577
I don't know.

03:00.647 --> 03:02.615
You don't know much, do you?

03:04.150 --> 03:05.708
I don't know. No idea.

03:07.187 --> 03:11.021
Maybe you'd like
six months in the hole.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.081
How would you like that?

03:14.194 --> 03:15.183
I don't know.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.524
Well, I do know.

03:17.597 --> 03:19.588
You won't like it one bit.

03:19.666 --> 03:23.295
Maybe we postpone
your trial date indefinitely.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.599
What do you think of that?

03:27.640 --> 03:31.474
I'll be out of any jail
you put me in by 3:00 Friday.

03:32.812 --> 03:33.836
And why is that?

03:33.913 --> 03:38.816
Because I have to see
someone at 4:00 on Friday.

04:17.123 --> 04:18.522
You all right, Mom?

04:21.060 --> 04:23.494
Mom? You all right?

04:23.563 --> 04:25.224
Sure, sure.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.295
Am I dead?

04:32.372 --> 04:33.999
No, Mom, you're not dead.

04:35.642 --> 04:36.802
Damn it!

04:38.678 --> 04:40.043
Oh, Henry.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.547
I know you have...
I know you have to go.

04:45.685 --> 04:48.449
Honestly, I'm so proud of you, son.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.856
I'm just gonna miss you so much.

04:51.924 --> 04:54.154
I know, I know.
No, no, no.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.558
No more smoking. Come on.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.596
Henry, it's all I've got left.

04:57.664 --> 04:58.722
That's not true.

04:58.798 --> 04:59.958
Wait a second.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.559
What, what, what?

05:02.635 --> 05:04.603
No. No, Mom.

05:04.671 --> 05:05.797
Yes, Henry.

05:08.574 --> 05:10.064
Like your soda?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.770
Yeah, thank you.

05:11.844 --> 05:14.039
You're such a good son, Henry.

05:17.884 --> 05:19.818
Oh, my God.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.820
I can't believe you're leaving.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.629
Your father
would be so proud of you.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.096
I'm not so sure about that.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.497
Why do you say that, Henry?

05:35.501 --> 05:38.026
Because I'm an FBI agent,
and he died in jail.

05:38.104 --> 05:40.436
True, true,
but he'd still be proud of you.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.907
Look, you know that I might
not be able to contact you,

05:43.976 --> 05:47.707
you know, maybe... maybe even at all
while I'm on this operation,

05:47.780 --> 05:50.305
but I want you to know
that I am gonna be okay.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.715
Make sure of that, Henry,
because you're all I've got.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.298
Here you go.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.319
Here you go.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.050
Hello?

07:11.130 --> 07:12.290
Mom?

07:31.551 --> 07:33.246
Who the hell are you?

07:46.933 --> 07:48.093
Excuse me.

07:49.435 --> 07:52.233
Excuse me... miss?

07:57.243 --> 07:59.006
Oh, my God.

08:01.781 --> 08:03.339
Henry!

08:05.418 --> 08:06.942
Mom?

08:07.019 --> 08:09.010
Careful on the deck.
Very slippery.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.716
I see that, but when did
you get a pool put in?

08:11.791 --> 08:14.954
Oh, Henry, I kicked ass
in the stock market. I really did.

08:15.027 --> 08:17.325
You wouldn't believe
how much money I made.

08:17.396 --> 08:21.799
Oh, my stocks just kept splitting
and splitting and splitting.

08:21.868 --> 08:23.460
That's great.
Okay, great.

08:25.071 --> 08:26.800
Hey, listen. Okay, okay.

08:26.873 --> 08:29.808
Here. You wanna know what,
why don't you take this, okay,

08:29.876 --> 08:30.968
and cover those up.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.946
Oh, Henry. For God's sake,
I'm not gonna cover anything up.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.674
These were very, very expensive.

08:36.749 --> 08:38.443
There's so much I have to tell you.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.145
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.652
Well, go slow.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.188
Okay. Okay.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.589
So I dropped you off at the airport
and went to get a cup of coffee.

08:46.659 --> 08:47.751
What was in it?

08:48.761 --> 08:51.321
Well, honestly, a lot of sugar,
but that's not the point.

08:51.397 --> 08:54.628
This guy dropped a quarter in my cup.
I should've kissed that man on the lips.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.792
- Oh, Mom.
- Yep.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.768
He saved my life.
I looked like a bag lady.

08:57.837 --> 09:01.500
So I said, "Marty, you've gotta be
making some changes."

09:03.175 --> 09:04.267
Who's Marty?

09:04.343 --> 09:06.072
I don't go by Martha anymore.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.274
Okay.

09:12.351 --> 09:17.050
Well, Mom, I have
a surprise for you, too.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.954
Yes?

09:20.293 --> 09:21.624
I'm engaged.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.754
You're engaged?

09:26.799 --> 09:30.530
I got engaged to a wonderful woman
by the name of Emily

09:30.603 --> 09:32.070
who also works in the Bureau,

09:32.138 --> 09:35.369
and she's flying in this afternoon.

09:35.441 --> 09:39.707
Oh, Henry! Oh, my God!

09:42.982 --> 09:44.142
Mom?

09:47.753 --> 09:48.742
This is Emily.

09:48.821 --> 09:50.049
Oh, Emily!

09:51.390 --> 09:52.789
Oh, Mrs. Durand.

09:52.858 --> 09:54.519
Oh, Marty.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.754
Oh, I have a daughter.

09:56.796 --> 09:57.820
Henry.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.922
Oh, she's lovely.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.864
God, something smells great.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.732
Yeah, oh, I'm making
Henry's favorite turkey casserole.

10:04.804 --> 10:08.103
Don't expect anything too edible,
'cause I haven't made it in a long time.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.903
Oh, no, I'm sure it'll be great.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.534
I don't even care about the food.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.171
I'm just so happy
we're all together finally.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.544
You know, Henry told me
so much about you.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.846
In fact, you were
kind of all he talked about.

10:18.918 --> 10:22.319
Kind of worried about how obsessed
he seemed, but now I see why.

10:22.388 --> 10:25.516
Well, I hope you like garlic
because I made these...

10:25.591 --> 10:28.025
spanakopita appetizers,

10:28.094 --> 10:30.460
and there's a very spicy
red garlic dip.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.396
This is great.
You have to try this.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.403
Well, I got it from this Italian chef
that I was dating.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.573
You... you have a boyfriend?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.110
A boyfriend? No.

10:45.177 --> 10:48.738
Hell, no. Not gonna make
the mistake I made with your father.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.180
- Okay, good.
- I have several boyfriends.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.376
Party hearty, Marty.

10:55.621 --> 10:56.986
You okay?

10:57.056 --> 10:58.353
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

10:58.424 --> 11:01.723
So, Emily, what is it
that you do at the FBI?

11:01.794 --> 11:04.058
Are you a field agent like Henry?

11:04.130 --> 11:07.361
Yeah, I work in the field,
but mostly I do psychological profiling.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.424
Right on, right on,
like Clarice Starling.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.902
Well, nothing that exciting, but yeah.

11:11.971 --> 11:13.905
Mom, you've barely
touched your food.

11:13.973 --> 11:15.804
I don't mean to be rude
to you guys,

11:15.875 --> 11:18.537
but there was something
that I wanted to <i>do</i> later on.

11:18.611 --> 11:22.069
There was some business
that I needed to take care of.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.581
Over dinner?

11:23.649 --> 11:26.209
Yeah, but I can change my plans.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.947
No, don't be silly.
Don't change your plans 'cause of us.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.319
Where are you going?
It's 9:00.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.290
Well, my date's not coming till 10:30,

11:33.359 --> 11:37.090
and Henry, don't worry... after 12:00,
I don't turn into a pumpkin.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.359
So, tell us about your boyfriends.

11:40.433 --> 11:43.129
Okay. All right.
Well, where will I start?

11:43.202 --> 11:45.762
Well, there was Enrico, the chef.

11:45.838 --> 11:48.898
He was adorable.
He just wouldn't let me go.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.339
He would sit outside

11:50.409 --> 11:54.277
on the front lawn at night
just sobbing like a child.

11:54.346 --> 11:57.713
It was really just heartbreaking.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.273
Just sad.

12:01.654 --> 12:02.814
Right?

12:02.888 --> 12:04.219
Don't make me miss him.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.317
Emily knows what I mean.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.189
Anyway, it just took me
a long time to realize

12:11.263 --> 12:13.356
that there was
something missing inside.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.857
- Missing from inside the house?
- No, Henry.

12:16.936 --> 12:20.030
Missing inside here, spiritually.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.738
So started my quest
for enlightenment,

12:23.809 --> 12:25.834
inner peace, inner joy,

12:25.911 --> 12:28.345
the person
who'd gotten buried alive

12:28.414 --> 12:31.474
in a sea of nicotine
and packaged cakes...

12:31.550 --> 12:32.744
Yeah. This is so great.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.777
Yeah, yeah.

12:35.788 --> 12:36.846
So what did you do?

12:36.922 --> 12:38.014
I went to India.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.550
You went to India?

12:40.626 --> 12:41.854
Yeah.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.394
You used to never leave the house.

12:43.462 --> 12:47.057
Then I went to Tibet
and I studied Buddhism,

12:47.133 --> 12:50.296
and I read the Koran,
and then studied Kabala.

12:50.369 --> 12:51.666
And then I understood.

12:52.872 --> 12:53.861
What?

12:53.939 --> 12:58.103
That the whole world is
one truth-seeking organism,

12:58.177 --> 13:00.577
and so it doesn't matter
if your science is religion

13:00.646 --> 13:03.046
or your religion is science,
because we all seek meaning.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.414
We all seek our reason for being.

13:07.887 --> 13:09.650
That is so beautiful.

13:09.722 --> 13:13.715
And the reason why we're here is...?

13:16.629 --> 13:17.721
To have fun,

13:17.797 --> 13:20.391
because it's all over too freakin' fast.

13:28.073 --> 13:29.836
Marty!

13:29.909 --> 13:31.342
Well, I'll get that.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.642
Hey, honey, can you get that?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.486
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.422
Can I help you?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.733
Yeah, dude, I'm here for Marty.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.032
Dude?

14:02.942 --> 14:04.034
What?

14:04.109 --> 14:05.508
No, no, no.

14:06.612 --> 14:07.943
You said "dude."

14:09.715 --> 14:10.875
Yeah.

14:15.221 --> 14:18.315
Hey, Mom, there's some kid here.
He just called me dude.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.381
- You want me to just...
- That's Eddie!

14:20.459 --> 14:21.653
I can wait out here.

14:21.727 --> 14:24.890
Okay. Well, could you please
tell me that Eddie is here

14:24.964 --> 14:26.761
to collect money
for the newspaper

14:26.832 --> 14:29.323
or try and sell me
a magazine subscription?

14:29.401 --> 14:31.665
- Where is he?
- He's on the front porch.

14:33.138 --> 14:34.969
That's rude, Henry.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.471
- Eddie. Hi.
- Hey.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.445
Hey. I'm so sorry.
My son didn't know who you were.

14:41.513 --> 14:42.878
Oh, it's okay.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.473
You can't be too careful about
who you let in the house, right?

14:45.551 --> 14:46.677
Yeah, dude.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.686
Oh, my gloves.
I'll be right back.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.691
So, back to living with Mom, huh?

15:03.702 --> 15:04.726
Yep.

15:06.472 --> 15:09.771
You were doing some sort
of secret ops sort of stuff, right?

15:09.842 --> 15:10.831
Yeah.

15:12.344 --> 15:13.606
Would you tell me about it?

15:13.679 --> 15:15.840
If I did, it wouldn't be a secret.

15:20.452 --> 15:21.612
Yeah.

15:21.687 --> 15:22.847
That's awesome.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.992
- Did you ever kill anybody?
- Not yet.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.994
All right. Got 'em.

15:30.062 --> 15:31.120
Good night, Henry.

15:31.196 --> 15:32.185
Bye, Mom.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.322
What's that, Eddie?

15:33.399 --> 15:35.629
That's the beast, my dear.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.100
Beast tonight.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.627
You know it.

15:39.705 --> 15:42.868
Very special of you
to bring the beast, Eddie.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.739
You only deserve the best, darling.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.972
Don't wait up, Henry!

16:08.200 --> 16:10.031
Did that sound like a Harley?

16:11.704 --> 16:15.071
Something passes by this house
every 30 seconds, Henry.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.368
Come back to bed.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.410
- She can take care of herself.
- Marty!

16:18.477 --> 16:20.342
- She's a grown woman.
- Marty!

16:20.412 --> 16:23.347
- She did a bang-up job raising you.
- I love you!

16:24.350 --> 16:25.442
Wait a minute.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.952
- What is it, honey?
- Nothing. Go back to bed.

16:31.023 --> 16:34.015
No woman has ever
made me feel like this before.

16:34.093 --> 16:37.961
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.021
And I know you want me, too!

16:40.099 --> 16:42.590
Jiminy Cricket, really, honey?

16:42.668 --> 16:45.466
I know!
I can feel it in my bones.

16:45.537 --> 16:47.437
What is this guy doing?

16:47.506 --> 16:50.168
I want to make sweet love to you,

16:50.242 --> 16:51.573
and I want to do it...

16:52.611 --> 16:53.703
now!

16:57.950 --> 16:59.383
What's so funny?

16:59.451 --> 17:01.510
Your mom must be
a hottie in bed.

17:01.587 --> 17:02.611
Emily!

17:02.688 --> 17:05.680
- What? Does that bother you?
- Yes! It does. It bothers me.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.749
We're sexual beings, Henry.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.420
It is the denial of it
that gets us into trouble.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.068
I'm gonna call the cops on you!

17:22.174 --> 17:23.903
Marty!

17:23.976 --> 17:25.637
Will you go get me my gun?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.178
Oh, God, leave him alone.

17:27.246 --> 17:30.010
Come on.
Just leave him be, Henry.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.484
Come on. Come to bed.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.951
Let's fool around.

17:35.020 --> 17:38.251
You want... you want to fool around
with this nut outside?

17:38.323 --> 17:39.483
Yeah.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.462
I'm getting it myself.

17:47.966 --> 17:51.129
Would you ever do that for me
if we broke up?

17:51.203 --> 17:54.195
Do what? Drive an expensive car
and get drunk on your lawn?

17:54.273 --> 17:57.572
No. To hell with him, Henry.
Just come to bed.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.372
We haven't seen
each other in weeks.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.140
Wait, why would you say that?

18:01.213 --> 18:03.113
Why would you even think
about breaking up?

18:03.182 --> 18:04.342
We just got engaged.

18:06.385 --> 18:08.649
A little sympathy here,
Emily, all right?

18:08.720 --> 18:10.000
I'm sitting here,
it's my first night back at home,

18:10.000 --> 18:11.245
You're Watching 123Movies.to
I'm sitting here,
it's my first night back at home,

18:11.245 --> 18:11.323
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:11.323 --> 18:14.554
I've got some drunk Italian chef
serenading my mother
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.554 --> 18:14.626
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.626 --> 18:16.253
who's not even here...
where is she?
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:16.253 --> 18:16.328
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:16.328 --> 18:18.888
She's on a date riding
some young guy's beast.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:18.888 --> 18:20.999
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:20.999 --> 18:22.000
At least somebody is.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:22.000 --> 18:23.024
At least somebody is.

18:31.176 --> 18:34.202
Hello, Enrico.
I'm Henry.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.712
I'm Martha...

18:36.982 --> 18:38.540
Marty's son.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.380
I'm gonna be staying here awhile.

18:42.254 --> 18:43.551
The one in the FBI.

18:44.656 --> 18:45.714
That's the one.

18:53.765 --> 18:57.201
Tell your mother that I
can't live without her.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.260
Yeah, I'm sure
she's gotten the message.

19:00.439 --> 19:01.497
<i>Ciao.</i>

19:06.245 --> 19:09.339
You come to my restaurant,
I take care of you. Very good.

19:09.414 --> 19:12.577
I make wonderful Kung Pao chicken.
You might like it.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.585
I'm gonna move the car right now.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.915
You better move on.

19:58.597 --> 20:00.963
No. Thank you.

20:05.637 --> 20:08.401
Your mom is like a mongoose,
let me tell ya.

20:09.808 --> 20:10.968
Yeah?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.977
Insane.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.139
We keeping you up?

20:16.215 --> 20:17.512
Yes.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.274
I'm sorry to hear about that.

20:22.521 --> 20:24.352
Gonna get back up there.

20:29.127 --> 20:30.822
Hey. Good morning, honey.

20:30.896 --> 20:34.798
Good morning, Mom.
Where's Eddie?

20:34.866 --> 20:36.629
Oh, he had to leave early.

20:36.702 --> 20:37.862
He had a final.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.235
Well, let's hope
our little Eddie gets an "A."

20:44.910 --> 20:46.537
Grape-Nuts?

20:46.612 --> 20:48.739
No. Thank you.

20:51.617 --> 20:53.107
Is there something wrong?

20:57.055 --> 20:59.455
Okay, look. Mom...

21:00.626 --> 21:04.460
I've been thinking
about this a lot, and...

21:06.031 --> 21:09.125
I am glad that you've
turned your life around,

21:09.201 --> 21:11.169
you know, that you've
turned into this,

21:11.236 --> 21:13.864
dare I say it,
really attractive woman.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.533
Don't you think
you should slow down a little?

21:17.576 --> 21:19.635
Well, Henry,
I'm not in my 20s anymore.

21:19.711 --> 21:21.042
Can you pass me the milk?

21:21.113 --> 21:23.809
Right, yeah,
no, I understand that.

21:23.882 --> 21:26.817
It's just... would it kill you
to date someone your own age?

21:28.186 --> 21:31.986
Henry, listen.
It's not serious with Eddie.

21:32.057 --> 21:34.252
We're just, you know...

21:34.326 --> 21:36.521
We're just having a little fun.

21:37.829 --> 21:40.059
You know what I've been
meaning to say to you, though?

21:40.132 --> 21:42.999
You know, I think
you scored really big with Emily.

21:43.068 --> 21:44.262
I know.

21:45.604 --> 21:47.162
I hope you know
how lucky you are,

21:47.239 --> 21:49.833
'cause I never found
what you two have

21:49.908 --> 21:52.069
and I don't think
you should take it for granted,

21:52.144 --> 21:53.509
not for one second.

21:54.579 --> 21:55.876
I won't.

22:02.287 --> 22:04.619
I heard you and your mom
talking this morning.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.158
She seems kind of lonely.

22:07.225 --> 22:10.422
Lonely? It sounds like she's been
intimate with half of Shreveport.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.463
I think we should
find her a good guy.

22:12.531 --> 22:14.999
We're not matchmaking.
That's something old ladies do.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.001
See, someone like that,
for instance. Look.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.503
He's probably buying a toy
for his kids. He's cute.

22:19.571 --> 22:22.597
How do you know that's not
how he picks up little boys at the park?

22:38.924 --> 22:40.653
Oh, my God. Oh.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.887
Hi, Mom. Are you having fun?

22:44.563 --> 22:46.758
I feel like I'm on ecstasy!

22:47.766 --> 22:49.666
Gonna pretend
I didn't hear her say that.

22:49.735 --> 22:52.067
Hey, Mom. Can we go?

22:52.137 --> 22:53.832
- You're embarrassing me.
- What?

22:53.905 --> 22:56.669
Can we go?
You're embarrassing me.

22:56.742 --> 22:59.734
I can only wish
this kind of pleasure on you, son.

22:59.811 --> 23:01.335
Can't force it.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.013
Jesus Christ.
Mom, are you okay?

23:07.085 --> 23:08.814
- What is this thing? Mom?
- Marty? Marty!

23:08.887 --> 23:11.913
It was my fault.
I was fiddling with it.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.924
I am terribly sorry.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.384
Hi.

23:17.462 --> 23:19.657
Hello. I'm very sorry.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.824
Aren't you a little old
to be playing with toys?

23:21.900 --> 23:22.992
You could've killed her.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.696
Yeah, could have been... tragic.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.671
It's nothing.

23:27.739 --> 23:28.899
Nothing.

23:28.974 --> 23:32.000
- Mom, you could have been hurt.
- Henry, it's nothing.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.101
It's not nothing!

23:33.178 --> 23:35.169
She said it's nothing.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.647
All right. Come here.

23:39.718 --> 23:42.619
It's a small island hidden away
in the East Caribbean

23:42.687 --> 23:44.348
called Antiga.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.721
I think you mean Antigua.

23:46.792 --> 23:49.625
No, no, no. Antiga.

23:49.694 --> 23:52.720
Antigua is a trap for tourists.

23:52.798 --> 23:55.995
No, I spend all morning
in this beautiful

23:56.067 --> 23:59.127
crescent-shaped inlet
called Half Moon Bay.

24:00.138 --> 24:03.369
There's a reef that cuts it off
from the rest of the Caribbean Sea,

24:03.442 --> 24:06.707
and you just stand there
and watch the waves break

24:06.778 --> 24:10.111
with the sun rising behind them.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.846
It's the most mesmerizing place
in the world.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.349
Sounds perfect.

24:18.423 --> 24:21.358
It is, but at the same time,
it's tragic.

24:21.426 --> 24:24.486
You know, about a century ago
a hurricane destroyed the island

24:24.563 --> 24:27.031
and buried the city under water.

24:27.098 --> 24:30.556
You can still see tops of the buildings
below the surface of the bay.

24:31.937 --> 24:34.770
At night, the locals celebrate
the end of each day

24:34.840 --> 24:36.671
with a feast of the sea's bounty,

24:36.741 --> 24:38.003
and they sing folk songs

24:38.076 --> 24:42.240
under a sky where I swear
you can see a billion stars.

24:43.315 --> 24:47.342
Maybe the most
romantic place on earth.

24:49.955 --> 24:51.217
Sorry.

24:52.491 --> 24:56.450
It's okay. In many cultures,
it's considered a compliment.

24:58.029 --> 24:59.894
- See?
- Excuse me, your check.

24:59.965 --> 25:01.364
- Oh, yeah.
- No, no, no.

25:01.433 --> 25:02.900
I insist. I insist.

25:03.935 --> 25:07.371
Keep it. Well...

25:07.439 --> 25:09.634
It's always nice to make new friends.

25:09.708 --> 25:13.235
Listen, guys, if you're not doing
anything this afternoon...

25:14.246 --> 25:16.680
I'd like you all to experience
something with me.

25:17.749 --> 25:21.378
No, I think we're busy, Mr...

25:21.453 --> 25:23.080
Oh, please, please.
Call me Tommy.

25:23.154 --> 25:26.487
Okay, Tommy,
I think we're... we're busy.

25:31.563 --> 25:33.758
Or... or... or not.

25:35.634 --> 25:36.794
Good.

25:44.309 --> 25:46.174
All right. This is it.

25:47.345 --> 25:50.473
This statue is actually
touring the world this year,

25:50.549 --> 25:52.449
a recently discovered work.

25:52.517 --> 25:57.011
It's one of the most priceless
and most beautiful sculptures

25:57.088 --> 25:58.988
to have come
from the artist's hand.

26:00.025 --> 26:02.619
He represents
what many art experts

26:02.694 --> 26:05.720
believe to be Bernini's mother
and youngest brother.

26:05.797 --> 26:08.027
Right on. Right on.
It's beautiful.

26:09.034 --> 26:12.003
Isn't it?
Let me show you something.

26:13.939 --> 26:16.464
You see, it's... it's all balanced.

26:16.541 --> 26:17.599
Balanced.

26:17.676 --> 26:20.509
Those two really seem
to like each other, don't they?

26:20.579 --> 26:21.910
Yeah.

26:21.980 --> 26:23.743
At least he's of voting age.

26:27.786 --> 26:28.775
Nice.

26:28.853 --> 26:30.343
What is?

26:31.356 --> 26:33.688
Those are laser detection devices.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.852
The statue has been
the object of desire for art thieves

26:36.928 --> 26:38.793
for several years now.

26:38.863 --> 26:41.832
In fact, there have been two attempts
in just the last three years.

26:44.135 --> 26:47.935
Tommy. Well, this has...
this has been great.

26:48.006 --> 26:50.668
And there is no reason
why it should end.

26:50.742 --> 26:53.711
Guys, listen, I know
a terrific Albanian restaurant

26:53.778 --> 26:55.405
that I've been going to for years.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.913
Yeah, but we just ate.

26:56.982 --> 26:59.917
No, no, of course.
I meant sometime this weekend.

26:59.985 --> 27:01.782
How about Saturday night?

27:02.787 --> 27:05.255
Marty? Henry? Emily?

27:05.323 --> 27:06.847
You will be my guests.

27:06.925 --> 27:08.051
Yes.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.865
Marty, these are flowers for you.

27:14.933 --> 27:16.833
I have flowers for you.

27:16.901 --> 27:22.362
I have... they are for you.
I have red roses for you.

27:22.440 --> 27:26.342
It is shit compared to your beauty.

27:26.411 --> 27:28.641
Right on time.

27:28.713 --> 27:30.977
Can I make an observation?

27:31.049 --> 27:33.074
Only if I can shoot Enrico.

27:34.519 --> 27:37.852
Okay, for a long time,
from what you told me,

27:37.922 --> 27:40.447
you were always
the parent in the relationship.

27:40.525 --> 27:41.856
Yes.

27:41.926 --> 27:45.089
And you doted on your mom

27:45.163 --> 27:48.030
because your father
had abandoned her.

27:48.099 --> 27:49.191
Yeah.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.758
And then you became
the surrogate husband.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.062
Okay.

27:54.139 --> 27:56.869
So, I'm just thinking that maybe...

27:56.941 --> 27:59.409
you're a little hung up
on your mama.

27:59.477 --> 28:01.468
Oh, that is disgusting!

28:01.546 --> 28:03.241
I don't mean in a sexual way.

28:03.314 --> 28:04.747
Good. I would hope not.

28:04.816 --> 28:06.113
Although...

28:07.218 --> 28:09.982
there's a large sexual component
to mother/son relationships.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.352
Oh, God.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.925
All right. Forget it.

28:20.131 --> 28:22.326
Do you ever think of your mom
when we're having sex?

28:22.400 --> 28:24.265
Oh, God!

28:26.838 --> 28:27.930
It's just a question.

28:28.006 --> 28:30.634
Well, let me answer your question.
No. No, I haven't.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.075
Thank God I haven't,
but you wanna know what?

28:33.144 --> 28:36.671
Now I'm not sure how I'm gonna
be able to not think about her.

28:36.748 --> 28:39.444
Thank you very much.
Good night.

28:39.517 --> 28:44.147
Marty!
What are you thinking?

28:44.222 --> 28:46.156
Are you sleeping?

28:50.128 --> 28:51.755
Marty Durand?

28:51.830 --> 28:52.990
That's me.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.191
Could you sign here
at the bottom, please?

28:56.868 --> 28:58.426
Those are really lovely.

28:58.503 --> 29:00.471
Yes, they are.
Come on. We gotta go.

29:00.538 --> 29:02.267
"Till next we meet. Tommy."

29:02.340 --> 29:05.173
See. I like this Tommy guy.
I like him, Marty.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.211
- Okay, come on. Let's go.
- Okay, okay.

29:07.278 --> 29:08.336
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.607
Bye.

29:09.781 --> 29:11.078
Bye.

29:17.122 --> 29:20.057
Your mom is a big girl.
You have to let her live her life.

29:20.125 --> 29:21.786
- Yeah.
- Henry.

29:21.860 --> 29:23.987
Yeah, yeah. No, no, no.
I hear you. I hear you.

29:24.062 --> 29:26.030
It's just my luck,
marrying a shrink.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.394
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

29:27.465 --> 29:28.762
I'll see you later.

29:30.902 --> 29:32.665
- You're late.
- Yeah, no kidding.

29:32.737 --> 29:34.728
- We have a briefing.
- When?

29:34.806 --> 29:36.535
- Now.
- Oh, God.

29:38.810 --> 29:42.177
On that Bernini statue
we have here in town:

29:42.247 --> 29:44.511
last night,
we were informed by Interpol

29:44.582 --> 29:46.516
that they have reason to believe

29:46.584 --> 29:49.280
the same crew
of highly sophisticated art thieves

29:49.354 --> 29:51.652
that attempted to steal it in Paris

29:51.723 --> 29:55.750
are gonna try to take another shot
at the statue here in Shreveport.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.954
We're inclined to agree.

29:58.029 --> 30:00.156
Interpol believes
three men were involved...

30:00.231 --> 30:04.065
one French, one Greek,
and one of unknown origin.

30:06.371 --> 30:09.397
Niko Evangelatos
is a career criminal,

30:09.474 --> 30:11.601
only high-end merchandise.

30:11.676 --> 30:13.507
He was known
to be in Rome and Paris

30:13.578 --> 30:15.512
at the time
of the attempted heist.

30:15.580 --> 30:16.945
We know for a fact

30:17.015 --> 30:19.745
that he's here
in the United States now.

30:20.952 --> 30:24.046
Jean Yves Tatao
is another career criminal.

30:24.122 --> 30:27.785
He's believed to have been involved
in the Paris bank robbery of 2001

30:27.859 --> 30:30.953
where over $6 million was stolen.

30:31.029 --> 30:34.658
Now, very little
is known about the third man,

30:34.732 --> 30:37.792
believed to be the ringleader.

30:37.869 --> 30:39.166
Oh, shit!

30:40.405 --> 30:41.736
Don't get up. Don't get up.

30:41.806 --> 30:43.967
Special Agent Wagner
told me everything.

30:44.042 --> 30:46.476
Are you certain this is the same man
from your case file?

30:49.881 --> 30:51.473
Is the woman on your right
your mother?

30:51.549 --> 30:52.413
Yes, sir.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.554
That's a good-looking woman.

31:02.961 --> 31:05.088
This is a really good-looking woman.

31:08.900 --> 31:11.061
Hey, Alex, she's
a heartbreaker or what?

31:11.135 --> 31:12.568
She's beautiful.

31:14.405 --> 31:16.669
She's stunning.
I like that.

31:18.142 --> 31:20.975
Look, how long has your mother
been going with this guy?

31:21.045 --> 31:22.979
Well, the same as me.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.275
Same as you?

31:24.349 --> 31:26.249
Well, we...
we didn't spend...

31:26.317 --> 31:28.376
she spent the day
together with him,

31:28.453 --> 31:31.445
and I happened to be...
we all just met.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.416
I need to know
every place you went.

31:36.094 --> 31:38.187
- We went to the museum.
- What?

31:38.263 --> 31:40.163
To look at the statue.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.223
- And?
- Well, and...

31:43.301 --> 31:44.598
We looked at the statue.

31:44.669 --> 31:47.263
He went on and on,
but I wasn't all that interested,

31:47.338 --> 31:49.772
so I didn't listen closely
to what he was saying.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.138
Does he know you're an agent?

31:51.209 --> 31:52.836
- I don't believe so.
- Good.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.038
Let's keep it that way
as long as we can.

31:55.113 --> 31:58.310
I want you to encourage your mother
to continue to see this guy.

31:58.383 --> 31:59.372
It's not an option.

32:01.619 --> 32:03.018
Oh, and one more thing...

32:03.087 --> 32:05.146
share this with no one,

32:05.223 --> 32:07.282
not even your fiancée.

32:24.842 --> 32:25.866
Tommy.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.707
Hey. How are you, Howie?

32:27.779 --> 32:29.906
- Henry.
- Henry. Henry.

32:30.915 --> 32:33.076
- Glad you could make it.
- Thank you.

32:34.886 --> 32:37.354
This is... this is beautiful, cozy.

32:38.423 --> 32:40.288
Do you know
when the house was built?

32:40.358 --> 32:41.347
No.

32:43.161 --> 32:45.026
Oh, you play the piano?

32:45.096 --> 32:46.188
No.

32:47.198 --> 32:48.529
- The bongos?
- No.

32:49.701 --> 32:50.998
Right.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.167
- Hi.
- Oh, Emily, how are you?

32:55.173 --> 32:57.004
Hi, Tommy.
It's so good to see you.

32:57.075 --> 32:58.269
Thank you, same here.

32:58.343 --> 32:59.742
- Same here.
- Good.

33:01.512 --> 33:02.774
Breathtaking.

33:02.847 --> 33:06.783
I know! I know.
I just can't believe it.

33:10.555 --> 33:11.715
Hi.

33:13.091 --> 33:14.080
Nice to see you.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.352
Same here. Same here.

33:15.426 --> 33:18.418
I only say that because
I used to be so fat.

33:19.564 --> 33:20.622
Fat.

33:20.698 --> 33:21.722
Just huge.

33:21.799 --> 33:23.460
It's hard to believe.

33:23.534 --> 33:24.967
Would you like
to see some pictures?

33:25.036 --> 33:28.028
Tommy, can I
interest you in a drink?

33:28.106 --> 33:30.836
- Sure, yeah.
- Great, what's your poison?

33:30.908 --> 33:32.307
Scotch.

33:33.311 --> 33:36.075
Oh, rocks or neat or...

33:36.147 --> 33:37.478
Oh, neat, yeah.

33:38.483 --> 33:40.508
Sweetie, you all right
with that Heineken?

33:40.585 --> 33:41.847
Great. Thanks.

33:44.822 --> 33:46.881
Are you trying
to get me drunk, Henry,

33:46.958 --> 33:48.755
tell you all my secrets?

33:49.994 --> 33:53.088
Just kidding. Just kidding.
I just don't wanna get pulled over.

33:53.164 --> 33:55.632
Oh, don't worry.
You won't get a ticket with us.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.224
Really? Why is that?

33:57.301 --> 33:59.098
I'd like to propose a toast...

33:59.170 --> 34:00.501
210.

34:00.571 --> 34:01.560
Oh, my God.

34:01.639 --> 34:03.334
...to new friends.

34:03.408 --> 34:04.670
Yeah, to new friends.

34:04.742 --> 34:07.006
- Here you go. All right.
- To new friends.

34:07.078 --> 34:08.601
How can you get out of a ticket?

34:08.679 --> 34:10.976
- Oh, she's joking.
- No, I'm not.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.313
- All right.
- We're with the FBI.

34:15.085 --> 34:16.485
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.146
- It went on the...
- Are you okay?

34:18.222 --> 34:21.248
Yeah. Sorry. Fine.
That's... that's good.

34:21.324 --> 34:23.793
Yeah. We're field agents.
That's how we met.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.623
Isn't that perfect?

34:25.696 --> 34:28.391
Yeah, both...

34:28.466 --> 34:31.663
Henry and Emily just got back
from some kind of hush-hush mission.

34:33.938 --> 34:36.099
Well, that... that is impressive.

34:36.174 --> 34:38.335
It sounds kind of dangerous.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.377
- Well... it wasn't.
- I'm 185.

34:40.445 --> 34:41.605
185.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.341
I was just tracking
a money laundering scheme.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.440
So then you do
forensic accounting?

34:46.516 --> 34:47.609
Yes.

34:47.685 --> 34:50.654
I'm very impressed.
You seem to know a little about the FBI.

34:50.721 --> 34:52.052
Yes, yes. I do. I do.

34:52.123 --> 34:53.420
But, okay, shall we go?

34:53.491 --> 34:55.186
Wait, Tommy.
Tommy, one more.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.317
170.

34:56.393 --> 34:59.090
- Getting better, getting better.
- Yeah.

34:59.163 --> 35:01.097
Big benchmark for me... 170.

35:01.165 --> 35:02.427
Let's go, Howie.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.728
- Henry.
- He... Henry.

35:03.801 --> 35:04.995
- 210.
- Impressive, right?

35:05.069 --> 35:07.970
Well, 250, then down to 170
and back to 230.

35:08.039 --> 35:09.939
That's very interesting.

35:10.007 --> 35:11.941
- Coming?
- Coming.

35:18.483 --> 35:19.745
Where's the restaurant?

35:19.817 --> 35:21.682
Right there.
Come on, guys.

35:25.156 --> 35:27.920
Trust me, please.
Anyone can go to Delmonico's.

35:39.504 --> 35:42.439
- That's right, Officer.
- Right where the light is.

35:42.507 --> 35:44.600
Do you see that...
that green coupe?

36:01.692 --> 36:03.250
- Thank you.
- Fantastic.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.386
- Okay, where are the menus?
- Oh, no menus.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.454
Victor just brings food
out of the kitchen.

36:07.532 --> 36:08.726
Love that.

36:08.799 --> 36:10.266
What kind of food?

36:10.334 --> 36:12.529
Well, I generally don't ask.

36:12.603 --> 36:14.730
It's some of the tastiest stuff
you'll ever have.

36:14.805 --> 36:17.137
- You having fun?
- I'm having a blast, Tommy.

36:18.209 --> 36:21.178
Listen, my mom and I
are transplants from New York,

36:21.245 --> 36:24.112
so generally, we don't like to eat
any kind of marsupials.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.845
So are you sure
that this is actually a restaurant?

36:27.919 --> 36:29.284
You mean, do they serve food?

36:29.353 --> 36:32.254
Yeah, but I doubt a health inspector
has ever been here.

36:33.324 --> 36:35.884
What do you do
for a living exactly, Tommy?

36:37.395 --> 36:39.693
I'm an international
business consultant.

36:39.764 --> 36:41.629
Henry, will you
do me a favor, please?

36:42.633 --> 36:44.464
You know, my guess is

36:44.535 --> 36:47.834
that half the clientele here
might be a little shady.

36:47.905 --> 36:49.668
- You think?
- Yeah.

36:49.740 --> 36:52.140
Maybe we should
keep your profession on the QT.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.701
I wanna make sure when they
bring the alligator sausage

36:54.779 --> 36:56.679
that's all we're getting,
know what I mean?

36:56.747 --> 36:58.237
- Alligator sausage.
- Yeah.

36:58.316 --> 37:00.307
This is Albanian moonshine.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.284
Here we go. All right.

37:02.353 --> 37:04.821
Made in my bathroom,
in my bathtub.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.323
In your bathtub? Thank you.

37:07.391 --> 37:08.756
I thought it was water.

37:08.826 --> 37:10.000
Oh, no, no.
You go easy on this stuff.

37:10.000 --> 37:10.589
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
Oh, no, no.
You go easy on this stuff.

37:10.589 --> 37:10.661
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:10.661 --> 37:11.958
Oh, all right. Fill 'er up.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:11.958 --> 37:12.029
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:12.029 --> 37:14.429
I'm not kidding.
This stuff makes you do crazy things.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:14.429 --> 37:14.498
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:14.498 --> 37:16.796
Make it a double!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:16.796 --> 37:18.936
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:18.936 --> 37:20.096
All right, so...
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:20.096 --> 37:21.105
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:21.105 --> 37:22.000
- What is that?
- The thing you open a garage with.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:22.000 --> 37:23.369
- What is that?
- The thing you open a garage with.

37:31.449 --> 37:33.178
Don't throw the cups!

37:33.251 --> 37:36.152
Guys, you are good people.

37:36.220 --> 37:37.619
I'm glad we all met...

37:39.056 --> 37:40.751
especially you, Marty.

37:41.892 --> 37:43.723
I don't wanna
be too forward, but...

37:44.795 --> 37:47.696
I feel I've known you for years.

37:49.433 --> 37:50.695
Is that a good thing?

37:50.768 --> 37:51.996
Yeah.

37:53.037 --> 37:55.232
Some people
you just know and trust.

37:55.306 --> 37:57.706
Oh, that's really nice, Tommy.

37:58.843 --> 38:00.003
Your eyes...

38:00.077 --> 38:02.739
Your eyes don't lie, do they.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.313
Life's too short for lies.

38:13.724 --> 38:15.351
I think that's your cell phone.

38:17.695 --> 38:18.992
You know, it's funny...

38:19.997 --> 38:21.487
I don't hear it.

38:25.970 --> 38:30.407
Okay. But maybe you should get it
'cause maybe it's important.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.171
Whoever this is,
this is very bad timing.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.080
<i>Who are those people</i>
<i>you are with?</i>

38:40.151 --> 38:43.314
Well, I'm a little busy right now.

38:43.387 --> 38:45.321
Where are you?

38:45.389 --> 38:47.653
<i>Try to look to your right.</i>

38:49.794 --> 38:50.852
Salut.

38:52.129 --> 38:53.460
Prick.

38:53.531 --> 38:55.226
Was that important?

38:55.299 --> 38:57.233
I'll be right back.
Bathroom.

38:57.301 --> 39:00.099
Oh, I have to go
to the bathroom, too.

39:01.272 --> 39:02.830
Oh, hello.

39:07.878 --> 39:09.368
Are you rich doctor?

39:11.382 --> 39:12.371
No.

39:12.450 --> 39:13.712
It's all right.

39:13.784 --> 39:14.808
Here we go.

39:16.153 --> 39:17.313
- Okay.
- Cheers.

39:17.388 --> 39:19.652
Bathroom? Water closet?

39:19.724 --> 39:20.884
A bathroom.

39:20.958 --> 39:22.357
Henry, just go with it. Relax.

39:22.426 --> 39:23.984
You want to go to bathroom with me?

39:24.061 --> 39:25.460
Bathroom. Bathroom.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.396
- Bathroom. Toilet-ay?
- He has to go to the bathroom. Sorry.

39:28.466 --> 39:29.956
I'm very sorry.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.401
How do you say
bathroom in Albanian?

39:33.471 --> 39:34.733
Who's the woman?

39:34.805 --> 39:35.999
A friend.

39:36.073 --> 39:37.301
She's very pretty.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.603
Yeah, she is.

39:38.676 --> 39:40.507
She also looks
like she's falling in love.

39:40.578 --> 39:42.239
You think?
Interesting.

39:47.485 --> 39:49.077
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:49.153 --> 39:50.643
- Friends of yours?
- Yeah, yeah.

39:50.721 --> 39:54.817
Jean Yves and Niko,
this is Henry.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.297
Bathroom?

40:01.365 --> 40:02.457
- Yes, there.
- Okay.

40:02.533 --> 40:03.966
- See you at the table?
- Yeah.

40:13.744 --> 40:14.733
Let's go.

40:14.812 --> 40:16.245
We gotta go?

40:19.016 --> 40:20.313
I need the cash.

40:21.986 --> 40:24.181
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's all right.

40:34.298 --> 40:35.560
So...

40:37.168 --> 40:39.659
Marty, tell me your life story.

40:41.305 --> 40:46.174
Okay. Well, I feel like
I've had three lives...

40:46.243 --> 40:48.973
the first one
with my husband.

40:49.046 --> 40:52.743
We met when I was in high school.
I was pregnant when I was 17.

40:52.817 --> 40:55.843
And one with Henry.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.182
And now this one.

40:58.856 --> 40:59.948
What about you?

41:01.025 --> 41:03.687
Me. Well, I am looking
very much forward

41:03.761 --> 41:06.855
to retiring, settling down.

41:08.666 --> 41:10.497
I just have to do
so much traveling.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.593
- Hotels and...
- For your business.

41:12.670 --> 41:15.571
Yeah, yeah.
I'm working on this one last deal,

41:15.639 --> 41:17.869
and after that
I think I am going to coast.

41:17.942 --> 41:20.206
Yes, yes!

41:20.277 --> 41:22.268
Coast if you want.
Transform your life.

41:22.346 --> 41:25.679
I believe that we should
only do what makes us happy.

41:25.749 --> 41:27.512
Hopefully, we have done

41:27.585 --> 41:29.780
all the stupid things
we could dream of.

41:30.955 --> 41:34.391
Well, I think there's time
for just a few more.

41:46.604 --> 41:49.038
Do you realize
what a big break this is for us,

41:49.106 --> 41:51.199
and for your career,
as a matter of fact?

41:52.276 --> 41:55.439
Sir, just how dangerous
is this suspect?

41:55.513 --> 41:58.846
Because my mom
really seems to like him,

41:58.916 --> 42:02.079
and quite frankly, sir,
I love my mother.

42:03.187 --> 42:05.121
Your mother couldn't be
in better hands.

42:05.189 --> 42:06.884
She'll have 24-hour surveillance

42:06.957 --> 42:09.517
and protection if anything
were to go wrong.

42:11.295 --> 42:14.389
So then, how would this
be good for my career, sir?

42:14.465 --> 42:16.729
You're going to lead
the task force, Agent Durand.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.234
You'll have five agents under you.

42:19.303 --> 42:23.899
Well, no, no.
Sir, I can't lead the task force.

42:23.974 --> 42:27.102
I can't be in charge of bugging
my own mother while she...

42:30.047 --> 42:33.414
As I said,
she really likes this guy.

42:35.185 --> 42:36.982
Oh, my God.

42:37.054 --> 42:41.184
You know, I never took
your feelings into consideration.

42:41.258 --> 42:43.283
I mean, the last thing
I would want to do

42:43.360 --> 42:45.920
is to make one
of my agents uncomfortable.

42:45.996 --> 42:47.827
- Well, thank you, sir.
- You know...

42:47.898 --> 42:51.527
we have a lovely little outpost
just north of Anchorage, Alaska.

42:51.602 --> 42:55.766
Now, I don't know,
but maybe, just maybe,

42:55.839 --> 42:58.774
you might find that
a little bit more comfortable, huh?

43:11.689 --> 43:13.452
All right, when you're done in here,

43:13.524 --> 43:16.982
let's hit the bathrooms
and the prime subject's bedroom.

43:17.061 --> 43:19.791
- Bedroom.
- I've got the lingerie drawer.

43:19.863 --> 43:21.160
Oh, this ought to be great!

43:22.333 --> 43:24.824
Can you move that mike
just a little to the right?

43:24.902 --> 43:26.301
That's great.

43:26.370 --> 43:29.897
Hey, Felder, come on.
We don't need this.

43:31.041 --> 43:34.704
Geez, Henry. Come on.
It's pillow talk.

43:34.778 --> 43:37.212
This is where the good stuff
always happens,

43:37.281 --> 43:39.112
right in the middle of coitus.

43:39.183 --> 43:41.344
"We rob the place Tuesday night."

43:41.418 --> 43:42.749
We're talking about my mother!

43:42.820 --> 43:45.015
Look, we need
to be able to trace

43:45.089 --> 43:47.387
any phone call
from this very location.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.653
Any call made
in the stated subject's bedroom,

43:49.727 --> 43:51.558
and I'll have a trace
within 45 seconds.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.995
Not the subject...
it's my mother!

43:54.064 --> 43:55.053
Okay, Henry.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.396
We're also going to need
your mommy's cell phone number

43:57.468 --> 43:59.060
in order to triangulate her location.

43:59.136 --> 44:01.297
See, it's called triangulation, Henry.

44:01.372 --> 44:02.862
Triangulation, Henry.

44:07.845 --> 44:08.869
Fine.

44:18.188 --> 44:19.587
Phone coming in.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.551
Hello?

44:23.627 --> 44:25.618
Marty? It's Tommy.

44:25.696 --> 44:27.061
Bingo.

44:28.599 --> 44:30.533
Are we still on for tonight?

44:30.601 --> 44:33.297
We are so on.
I'll be there in about an hour.

44:33.370 --> 44:35.304
Oh, good.

44:35.372 --> 44:36.532
See you.

44:41.512 --> 44:44.037
(318) 555-1000.

44:44.114 --> 44:46.582
He's at the... El Dorado Hotel.

44:46.650 --> 44:48.174
Oh, it is nice there.

44:48.252 --> 44:49.685
When the hell were you there?

44:49.753 --> 44:50.742
Oh, I was there.

44:50.821 --> 44:53.847
They leave these little mints
on the pillows, and it...

44:53.924 --> 44:55.016
Oh, forget about it.

44:55.092 --> 44:57.253
Just get Simpson
and Cisneros on the phone.

44:57.327 --> 45:00.626
Tell them he's at the El Dorado Hotel.
Get into his room and bug it.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.996
Find out if he's got a car
and bug that, too.

45:03.067 --> 45:05.001
- Man.
- I know. I know.

45:16.513 --> 45:17.878
All right.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.586
Are you strapped in?

45:25.656 --> 45:26.816
Why?

45:27.891 --> 45:29.449
You wanna have some fun?

45:29.526 --> 45:31.016
Yes.

45:31.095 --> 45:32.323
What did you have in mind?

45:32.396 --> 45:35.695
Let's open this baby up
and see what she can do.

45:40.971 --> 45:42.563
Shit. We've been made.

45:42.639 --> 45:45.972
Don't engage! Don't engage!
My mother is in that car.

46:17.141 --> 46:18.472
Come on, come on, come on.

47:05.322 --> 47:06.789
It's beautiful, isn't it?

47:07.791 --> 47:09.691
Everything pales next to you.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.058
Oh, my God!

47:16.133 --> 47:17.760
Do you mind
if I ask you a question?

47:17.835 --> 47:19.393
Yeah, sure. Ask away.

47:31.715 --> 47:33.546
<i>You were gonna ask me something?</i>

47:33.617 --> 47:36.643
<i>I was just wondering...</i>

47:36.720 --> 47:40.315
how could anybody
let you get away?

47:40.390 --> 47:43.848
Oh, come on. Don't fall for this.
This is such a line.

47:43.927 --> 47:46.452
<i>My ex-husband had a lot of problems,</i>
<i>but we weren't divorced,</i>

47:46.530 --> 47:48.555
if that's what you're asking.
He passed away.

47:48.632 --> 47:49.997
I'm sorry.

47:50.067 --> 47:51.466
Well, don't worry about it.

47:51.535 --> 47:53.730
We weren't speaking at the time.
He was in prison.

47:56.840 --> 47:59.468
You've always been
attracted to bad boys?

47:59.543 --> 48:01.306
I guess.

48:01.378 --> 48:03.812
Oh, baby.

48:03.881 --> 48:06.111
Hey, knock it off.

48:06.183 --> 48:09.311
<i>So, what do you see</i>
<i>when you see me?</i>

48:11.688 --> 48:13.918
Well, when I see you,

48:13.991 --> 48:15.754
I see nothin' but trouble.

48:15.826 --> 48:16.986
Yeah.

48:18.428 --> 48:21.659
I am so bad
that I should be forbidden.

48:25.903 --> 48:28.667
Oh, come on.
Don't fall for that!

48:29.673 --> 48:31.402
Gotta hand it to this guy,
very smooth.

48:31.475 --> 48:33.306
Yup. Very smooth.

48:33.377 --> 48:36.471
Tell me... tell me about Henry.

48:37.481 --> 48:38.709
Yeah. Henry.

48:38.782 --> 48:39.942
Well, Henry...

48:41.018 --> 48:43.111
Well, he's just the most beautiful,

48:43.186 --> 48:45.177
sensitive, intelligent, lovely...

48:45.255 --> 48:47.348
- <i>loving son...</i>
- Oh, geez, Henry.

48:49.026 --> 48:50.891
As much as I love him, though,

48:50.961 --> 48:53.122
he can be a real piece
of work sometimes.

48:53.196 --> 48:54.288
Why is that?

48:54.364 --> 48:56.332
Well, he can be a real watchdog.

48:58.001 --> 48:59.468
Shut up!

48:59.536 --> 49:01.527
<i>I'm probably responsible for that.</i>

49:01.605 --> 49:03.664
I think I might have
screwed him up a little bit.

49:03.740 --> 49:05.401
He used to be
so afraid of everything.

49:05.475 --> 49:07.534
I think I transferred
some of that on to him,

49:07.611 --> 49:09.545
and he was so busy
taking care of me

49:09.613 --> 49:11.604
that he missed out
on part of his childhood.

49:11.682 --> 49:16.312
I feel very responsible about that,
and I'd like to fix it somehow.

49:16.386 --> 49:18.980
Your mom's
a very special woman, Henry.

49:19.056 --> 49:20.489
Yup. Very special.

49:21.491 --> 49:23.652
<i>Well, his job has to be tough.</i>

49:23.727 --> 49:26.093
I mean, I would imagine
that in that line of work

49:26.163 --> 49:28.495
you start to believe
that everyone is up to something.

49:28.565 --> 49:31.534
Uh, yeah, like you,
you friggin' art thief!

49:31.601 --> 49:34.069
l... I would like for him
to know that I am okay,

49:34.137 --> 49:36.571
that there's nothing
to worry about with me,

49:36.640 --> 49:39.609
that my intentions are...

49:39.676 --> 49:43.203
you know, very honorable.

49:45.048 --> 49:47.380
Your eyes don't lie, do they.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.846
They can't, I guess.
I don't know.

49:54.024 --> 49:57.960
Well, don't worry about
being too honorable,

49:58.028 --> 50:01.293
'cause remember,
I like a little danger.

50:03.333 --> 50:04.527
Oh, baby.

50:06.103 --> 50:08.833
Oh, wow. She is hot!

50:08.905 --> 50:10.372
Felder! That is enough!

50:10.440 --> 50:11.907
I am not gonna tell you again.

50:14.578 --> 50:16.273
This is so good.

50:18.115 --> 50:19.412
I love it.

50:20.751 --> 50:22.616
- Are you hungry at all?
- No.

50:22.686 --> 50:24.153
Let's get the heck out of here.

50:27.624 --> 50:30.286
<i>You know, I haven't been</i>
<i>this happy in a long time.</i>

50:30.360 --> 50:32.123
- Heading east on River Walk.
<i>- Really?</i>

50:33.630 --> 50:36.292
I thought you were the one
with the exciting life.

50:36.366 --> 50:40.063
There is a difference
between excited and happy.

50:40.137 --> 50:41.798
Oh, so you're not excited?

50:44.708 --> 50:46.266
You're a tricky woman.

51:01.925 --> 51:04.257
Oh, no, no, no...

51:10.534 --> 51:12.468
Tommy...

51:12.536 --> 51:15.164
Tommy, I think we really
have to slow down here.

51:15.238 --> 51:17.672
- Yes! Very smart.
- Why?

51:21.278 --> 51:23.974
Wait, what happened
to slowing down?

51:26.883 --> 51:28.214
Because I just do.

51:28.285 --> 51:31.846
You're not acting like a person
who wants to slow down.

51:33.423 --> 51:35.687
I think I'm falling in love.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.784
Oh, God.

51:39.763 --> 51:41.060
Do you have to go home?

51:41.131 --> 51:42.564
Yes, she does!

51:43.567 --> 51:45.694
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.134
Yes, she does!

51:47.204 --> 51:48.933
Listen, I...

51:50.173 --> 51:52.835
I have a beautiful suite
at the El Dorado.

51:53.844 --> 51:55.471
We could really be alone there.

51:55.545 --> 51:57.206
No. She said no!

51:57.280 --> 52:00.249
- Ten bucks says she goes.
- Don't take that bet, Randle.

52:02.986 --> 52:03.975
Okay.

52:11.595 --> 52:13.028
Easy money.

52:24.641 --> 52:27.769
You're so sexy.

52:27.844 --> 52:29.243
I know!

52:29.312 --> 52:31.610
I mean, look at... look at that.

52:31.681 --> 52:34.479
Look at those moves.
Where did you learn that?

52:35.819 --> 52:38.652
- That's unbelievable. Yeah.
- I know.

52:38.722 --> 52:39.882
- You know.
- And...

52:39.956 --> 52:41.583
look at my ass.

52:41.658 --> 52:43.956
<i>Oh, like a wild animal.</i>

52:44.027 --> 52:45.688
<i>Olympic. Come over here.</i>

52:45.762 --> 52:48.390
I'm gonna give you
a gold medal right now.

52:48.465 --> 52:49.659
Oh, Tommy.

52:50.967 --> 52:54.403
<i>Ah, you learned that position.</i>

52:54.471 --> 52:56.632
<i>Oh, yes.</i>
<i>Yes, I just learned everything.</i>

52:56.706 --> 52:58.503
<i>I just got cable.</i>

53:03.947 --> 53:05.642
Wha... what?
Hold on, hold on.

53:07.150 --> 53:10.244
What is that thing?
What is that clicking?

53:10.320 --> 53:14.381
Oh, that's my jaw.
I have TMJ.

53:14.457 --> 53:15.549
What is that?

53:15.625 --> 53:17.252
Don't worry.
You can't catch it.

53:21.731 --> 53:23.995
<i>- Close your eyes.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

53:24.067 --> 53:25.295
<i>And open your mouth.</i>

53:25.368 --> 53:27.893
Okay. Oh, Tommy.

53:27.971 --> 53:28.960
Are you ready?

53:32.842 --> 53:35.743
Oh, Tommy. It's so big.

53:36.813 --> 53:38.405
And so juicy.

53:38.481 --> 53:40.005
Yeah, it is.

53:41.751 --> 53:42.740
Tell me, tell me.

53:42.819 --> 53:46.050
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i>

53:46.122 --> 53:49.216
<i>Went up the water spout</i>

53:49.292 --> 53:51.453
Yeah, why not?

53:51.528 --> 53:54.292
<i>Down came the rain</i>

53:54.364 --> 53:58.130
<i>And washed that spider out</i>

53:58.201 --> 53:59.498
Oh, okay. All right.

53:59.569 --> 54:00.934
Randle, turn that shit off.

54:01.004 --> 54:02.972
No, no, no.
This is work-related.

54:03.039 --> 54:04.973
Work-related my ass, Felder.

54:05.041 --> 54:06.269
<i>... all the rain.</i>

54:06.343 --> 54:07.537
God.

54:08.878 --> 54:12.746
<i>And the itsy-bitsy spider</i>

54:12.816 --> 54:17.776
<i>Went up the spout again</i>

54:17.854 --> 54:19.344
- Keep... keep going.
- Yes.

54:19.422 --> 54:20.514
It's good.

54:20.590 --> 54:21.614
Don't, don't.

54:21.691 --> 54:22.919
- Come on, Henry.
- What?

54:22.993 --> 54:24.483
- Don't. No, no, no.
- What?

54:24.561 --> 54:27.462
You wanna hear how
the "Itsy-Bitsy Spider" ends, Felder?

54:27.530 --> 54:29.054
Look, take your hands off!

54:29.132 --> 54:30.360
Oh, geez.

54:35.572 --> 54:37.199
- Henry?
- Yeah.

54:37.274 --> 54:38.741
Can you give me a hand in here?

54:39.909 --> 54:41.069
Yeah.

54:47.450 --> 54:49.714
Henry, we have
the house to ourselves.

54:51.388 --> 54:52.548
Oh, Jesus.

54:53.556 --> 54:55.183
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

54:55.258 --> 54:57.488
I can't do this tonight, okay?

54:57.560 --> 54:58.891
l... I know...

55:00.363 --> 55:03.196
It's just I have had
a long, hard day.

55:03.266 --> 55:04.893
Come on, Henry.

55:04.968 --> 55:06.492
Let's fool around.

55:06.569 --> 55:07.900
Okay, no, no, no...

55:09.105 --> 55:11.130
- Shit.
- It's okay, Henry. I got...

55:17.847 --> 55:18.939
What's this?

55:22.852 --> 55:24.547
That would be...

55:24.621 --> 55:26.213
A bug?

55:27.590 --> 55:28.750
Yeah.

55:30.760 --> 55:32.091
Oh, my God!

55:32.162 --> 55:34.926
Henry, this is like
a whole new level of crazy.

55:34.998 --> 55:36.090
No, no, no.

55:37.100 --> 55:39.068
What? No.

55:39.135 --> 55:43.071
Henry, you are listening in
on your mother.

55:45.975 --> 55:47.135
Yeah.

55:49.412 --> 55:53.473
After that, the subjects retired
to the El Dorado Hotel

55:53.550 --> 55:57.680
where a very passionate night ensued.

55:57.754 --> 56:01.781
And after that, nothing else
happened relating to the case.

56:02.859 --> 56:04.292
I can't help thinking...

56:05.362 --> 56:08.820
I wish my wife would try
that Itsy-Bitsy Spider thing.

56:09.899 --> 56:11.025
Oh, yeah.

56:11.201 --> 56:12.600
Oh, yeah.

56:19.542 --> 56:22.272
Turkey.
Great choice.

56:28.451 --> 56:29.782
All right...

56:30.787 --> 56:31.776
Henry.

56:33.022 --> 56:34.922
I think I know what you're up to.

56:36.860 --> 56:38.293
And that would be?

56:40.897 --> 56:42.797
You're protecting your mother.

56:44.067 --> 56:46.058
I don't know
what you're talking about.

56:46.136 --> 56:49.105
Listen, I am not trying
to replace your father.

56:49.172 --> 56:52.039
Good, 'cause we both know
where he wound up.

56:52.108 --> 56:54.440
And I am not trying
to steal your mother away.

56:54.511 --> 56:56.035
That's not what I want.

57:00.950 --> 57:02.781
What do you want, then?

57:02.852 --> 57:04.979
I want us to become friends.

57:07.223 --> 57:10.000
I'm gonna have
a lot of free time very soon.

57:10.000 --> 57:10.784
You're Watching 123Movies.to
I'm gonna have
a lot of free time very soon.

57:10.784 --> 57:12.862
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:12.862 --> 57:15.023
- How so?
- Your mother...
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:15.023 --> 57:16.032
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:16.032 --> 57:19.331
She made me
see things differently.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:19.331 --> 57:20.403
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:20.403 --> 57:22.000
I don't want to continue
living the life I've been living.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:22.000 --> 57:23.429
I don't want to continue
living the life I've been living.

57:25.175 --> 57:27.700
I'm gonna be making
some changes.

57:27.777 --> 57:30.678
International consulting
getting too boring for you?

57:30.747 --> 57:34.547
I guess I am just getting tired
of looking over my shoulder.

57:36.019 --> 57:39.216
Sounds like you don't trust
the people you do business with.

57:39.289 --> 57:40.449
I don't.

57:42.959 --> 57:44.483
They are thieves.

57:49.799 --> 57:51.027
Yeah.

57:53.069 --> 57:56.095
Henry, do you mind
if I join you for lunch?

57:58.441 --> 57:59.840
Not at all.

58:03.780 --> 58:05.441
Turkey sandwich, please.

58:08.751 --> 58:11.185
- It's not coming up.
- Are you sure?

58:11.254 --> 58:12.448
Positive.

58:14.791 --> 58:16.019
Oh, hi.

58:17.093 --> 58:18.117
What?

58:18.194 --> 58:19.286
How was lunch?

58:19.362 --> 58:20.693
Lunch?

58:20.763 --> 58:23.891
Yes. Lunch with Tommy.

58:23.967 --> 58:26.959
It was good. How did...

58:27.036 --> 58:28.560
Felder's got a big mouth.

58:28.638 --> 58:31.072
Great. Well, I'm glad
he's on my team.

58:32.442 --> 58:34.433
Okay. Please tell me

58:34.511 --> 58:37.275
that those are not
Tommy's fingerprints on that glass.

58:38.515 --> 58:39.675
Henry?

58:41.518 --> 58:42.951
All right. Come with me.

58:45.221 --> 58:46.916
- That's the men's room.
- I know.

58:48.925 --> 58:51.553
Okay. Listen to me, all right?

58:51.628 --> 58:54.722
I was given strict orders not
to utter a word of this to anyone.

58:54.797 --> 58:55.855
Of what?

58:58.268 --> 58:59.565
Guys, get out.

59:03.673 --> 59:04.765
What?

59:05.842 --> 59:07.469
The Bureau's watching Tommy.

59:08.745 --> 59:10.770
We're watching Tommy? Why?

59:10.847 --> 59:13.338
'Cause Mom picked
a real winner this time, Emily.

59:13.416 --> 59:14.906
She really hit the jackpot.

59:15.985 --> 59:18.215
Tommy's an international art thief.

59:18.922 --> 59:20.753
I really have to go.

59:20.823 --> 59:22.313
I really don't care.

59:22.392 --> 59:24.053
- Get out!
- Get out!

59:27.630 --> 59:28.961
You have to tell her.

59:29.032 --> 59:30.863
Yeah, and then resign.

59:32.468 --> 59:33.526
Oh, God.

59:36.506 --> 59:38.974
Henry, I'm so sorry.

59:42.412 --> 59:44.437
Screw you, Henry.

59:55.258 --> 59:56.987
Say, Tommy,
can I get you anything?

59:57.060 --> 59:58.652
- Coffee?
- Coffee would be great.

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:02.624
So, listen...

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:06.725
There are four grates
in the wall of the main room,

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.464
12 by 24 inches each,

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:10.972
so we should keep
our intake of linguini to a...

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:13.733
minimum.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.505
So, Tommy...

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:19.380
Why don't you tell us
about your new friend.

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:23.113
I hope...

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:26.747
you're planning on
using that gun, Niko...

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:29.418
because if you're not,

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:31.824
I'm gonna take it away from you

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:34.055
and I'm gonna stick it
right up your ass.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.529
Hey. Hey, Tommy.

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:38.500
Let us not be rude, huh?

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:40.433
We want to talk like gentlemen.

01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:44.768
All right.

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:47.139
He's the son of the woman
I've been dating.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.199
We got involved.

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:50.871
I had no idea
her son was a Fed.

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:54.405
If I dump her now,
it's gonna look far more suspicious.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.180
Look, we're knocking off
the place tonight.

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:03.089
What sense would it make
if I am talking to the FBI?

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:08.625
Maybe you got caught
doing something else...

01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:11.724
and you decided
to turn on your friends.

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:14.463
I have always had
my doubts about you, Tommy.

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:18.736
You never tell us how you
escaped from that jail in Paris.

01:01:30.553 --> 01:01:31.542
So...

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.953
are we going to keep this civil,

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:37.857
or am I going to be doing this
by myself tonight?

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:43.192
Well, Tommy, so I presume

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:45.496
you would like
to keep up the partnership.

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.970
I'll see you at midnight.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.505
It stinks in here.

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:01.943
<i>Hey, Henry, I'm about to go.</i>

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:16.688
What are you doing?

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:23.763
Mom, we need to talk.

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.435
Okay.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.409
Outside by the pool.

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:36.017
Outside by the pool.

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:38.980
What is it with you, Henry?

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:40.647
Why do we have to talk outside?

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.714
What are you always
so worried about?

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:46.023
It's like you're just listening
for the hiss in the speakers

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:47.892
and just not listening to the music.

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:49.397
What is it with you?

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:51.626
Mom...

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:57.298
What I'm gonna tell you
could cost me my job,

01:02:57.373 --> 01:03:00.069
my career, and everything
that I've worked for...

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:05.308
but I want you to know...
that I don't care about any of it.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.212
I only care about you.

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.252
Well, that is
very, very sweet, Henry,

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:12.287
but what the hell
are you talking about?

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:14.186
It's about Tommy.

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:17.720
What? What is it?

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:21.696
The FBI has been watching him.

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:26.525
Why?

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:29.562
Doesn't matter why.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.732
Yeah, it matters why, Henry.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:33.105
It does matter why.

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:37.409
He's a thief.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:41.143
- He's a thief?
- An art thief.

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:47.615
Well...

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:51.416
Boy, I can pick 'em, huh?

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.795
I'm sorry.

01:03:56.532 --> 01:04:00.866
The... entire house
has been bugged.

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:02.427
You've been under surveillance.

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:05.030
I didn't have any say
in the matter.

01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:10.271
Wait a second. Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:13.281
You're saying that everything
that's been going on here,

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:16.614
every conversation I've been having,
somebody's been listen...

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.779
you've been listening to?

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.015
Yes.

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:24.458
I just thought
that you should know.

01:04:26.662 --> 01:04:28.459
It is very important

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.965
that you don't tell Tommy
any of this.

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:34.335
Well, exactly what am I
supposed to do?

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:35.961
He's gonna be here
in ten minutes.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.232
Act normal,

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:40.298
and know that if anything happens,
you're not alone.

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:57.517
Are you all right?

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:03.125
How are my eyes?

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:05.190
Your eyes are beautiful.

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:07.800
Beautiful.

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:12.604
Hey, Marty.

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:14.233
Can I propose a toast?

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:17.237
Sure.

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:21.180
Raise your glass.

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:28.281
To us.

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:31.055
I love you, Marty.

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:49.067
You know, there...
I know so little about you.

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:51.878
What else do you need to know?

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.711
I mean, I'm crazy about you.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:57.480
Well, let's just talk a little bit
about what it is that you do.

01:05:57.553 --> 01:06:00.078
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:03.091
- No, it's boring.
- Yeah, no, it's not boring to me.

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:05.753
I'm very, very interested in
what it is that you do.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:13.868
All right, Marty. All right.

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:18.797
I've been working on a project
for several years.

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.970
It's kind of important to me...

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:24.205
or that's what I thought
until I met you.

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:27.248
Now I can't think straight.

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:32.517
Things that I thought were important
seem trivial to me now.

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:35.182
Wait, what does that mean?
What exactly does that mean?

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:37.885
That you were gonna quit
whatever it is that you were doing?

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:40.156
No, I can't.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.562
But after tomorrow,

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:46.590
I will close this deal,
and I'll be free from all of this.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:49.604
Marty, give me 48 hours, please.

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:54.102
All right, we got him.

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.234
Alert the troops.

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:56.835
It goes down tomorrow night.

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:00.981
All right.

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:06.881
So...

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:09.722
am I gonna see you again?

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.626
That all depends on you.

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.460
Oh, Marty, what's going on?

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:18.659
Nothing.
I'll see myself in.

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.429
Oh, come on. Come on!

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:23.935
Marty, what's wrong with you?
Come on!

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:25.735
I don't know
who you think you are,

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:28.675
coming into people's lives
and making them fall in love with you

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:30.644
like it's some kind
of big, sick game.

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.340
What are you talking about?

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:34.645
Oh, you know exactly
what I am talking about.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.878
I swear I have no idea
what you're saying.

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:40.513
You are not being
straight with me!

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:44.620
I will be.

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:53.301
God... damn it!

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:54.768
I just...

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:57.931
God!

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:01.633
Damn it.

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:15.322
Are you all right?

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:20.591
I hope you're happy, Henry.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:26.859
Jesus.

01:08:42.984 --> 01:08:44.350
Fuck it.

01:09:58.594 --> 01:09:59.754
Yeah.

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:01.420
It's Simpson.

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:02.862
He checked in for the night,

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:05.196
putting a "Do Not Disturb"
on the door,

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:07.667
and asked for
a 6:00 A.M. wake-up call.

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:09.829
All right. Well, stay there.

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:12.066
<i>Oh, Henry, the guy</i>
<i>went to bed for the night.</i>

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:13.870
I said stay there.

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:26.680
Mom?

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:28.850
Henry.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.523
I'm feeling really empty
and stupid right now.

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:45.157
- Back to work.
- All right.

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.579
Oh, no, get off him!
Hey, get off him!

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:08.282
Get off him!
Get up against that car!

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:09.790
Get up against that car!

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:14.051
You okay, buddy?

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:17.387
I am now.

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:03.994
Yeah.

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.471
Durand, Wagner.

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:07.668
An alarm just went off
at the museum.

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:09.870
City cops are on their way,

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:11.845
but you better go check it out.

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:13.609
Okay. Yeah, I'm there.

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:15.479
- What is it?
- That was Wagner.

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:17.883
The... the alarm
at the museum went off.

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:20.787
Well, I'm going with you.

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:23.051
No, you're not
technically on this case.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.423
Yeah, well, screw procedure.
This is family.

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:27.759
All right, fine.

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.160
We're tired of this!

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:57.854
Who's in charge here?

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:02.126
I am, sir. Canales.
Jim Canales.

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:04.563
So, what the hell
seems to be the problem?

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:07.363
- Well, the alarm went off, sir.
- Well, I can hear <i>that.</i>

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:09.131
Yeah, we don't know
what tripped it.

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:11.172
Was somebody at the monitor
when it went off?

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.264
Yes, sir.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.138
- Turn the damn thing off!
- Yes, sir.

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:15.267
Cut it!

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.209
- Cut it?
- Deactivate.

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:18.769
Deactivate!

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.112
<i>Agent Durand.</i>

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:28.679
Looks like it was a false alarm.
Where are ya?

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:31.419
<i>Well, I'm almost there.</i>
<i>What would you like me to do?</i>

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:33.427
You'd better back
and get some sleep.

01:15:33.495 --> 01:15:35.827
Looks like tomorrow
is gonna be a very long day.

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:37.763
Yeah, it's a good idea.

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:40.863
False alarm.

01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:51.040
Again?

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:01.444
Agent Durand.

01:16:01.523 --> 01:16:03.514
The alarm went off again.
Get down there.

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:04.581
I'm on my way.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.093
You're never gonna believe this.

01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:08.061
- Now what?
- The alarm went off again.

01:16:13.802 --> 01:16:16.703
- Agent Henry Durand.
- Emily Lott, FBI.

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:17.898
Police Chief Malone.

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:19.167
What seems to be the problem?

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:22.335
Well, there seems to be a malfunction
with this security system.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:23.935
And it keeps going off on its own?

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:26.674
Well, either that
or one of these statues came alive.

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:27.840
Is the alarm back on?

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:32.213
- You want it on?
- Absolutely.

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:36.713
- Activate it.
- Activate!

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:03.150
Well, let's get a computer tech
down here right away.

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:04.480
Yeah, that's what I said.

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:05.884
He's on his way.

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:22.158
Okay.

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:24.297
Shut it off!

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.365
Deactivate!

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:29.774
Oh, this can't go on all night!

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:32.542
Well, you're right about that.

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:37.417
Okay, I want you to place
five guards in the room.

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.477
Leave the alarm off
until a tech gets here.

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.522
- Understood?
- Consider it done, sir.

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.852
What are you thinkin'?

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.486
Let's check in on Tommy.

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:28.397
Keep it close
and keep it running.

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:29.459
Yes, sir.

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:32.372
Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:35.205
I need you to send
a maid to room 927.

01:18:35.277 --> 01:18:36.642
Room 927?

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:01.294
You're right.
That room is empty.

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:04.304
He's at the museum.
He wanted us to turn the alarm on.

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.272
- What are you talking about?
- Stay there!

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:14.345
Security. Canales.

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:16.577
This is Henry Durand, FBI.

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.846
I want you to shut down
the entire museum

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.184
and call back the police immediately.

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:24.020
Why? I can see it as clear as day.
The statue's right there.

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:25.957
Yeah, well,
how about your men?

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:29.488
They're not there.

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:31.623
<i>They're there,</i>
<i>most likely unconscious.</i>

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.897
<i>Look, they hacked into</i>
<i>your security system, all right?</i>

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:37.871
<i>The images on the screen</i>
<i>are not what's going on in the room.</i>

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:39.873
Call back the damn police.

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:47.312
Damn it.

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:54.315
Tommy, listen to me, please.

01:19:54.389 --> 01:19:56.516
About the partnership...

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:58.081
I think it is over.

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:00.823
<i>Au revoir.</i>

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:02.990
<i>Vamos,</i> Nikos.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:31.517
That's it.

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:39.290
What the hell's going on?

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:44.968
That was a huge mista...

01:21:10.432 --> 01:21:12.627
All right, let's split up.
Be careful.

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:41.959
Museum Security.

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:46.296
Hey, got a man down.
Get an ambulance here right now.

01:21:47.869 --> 01:21:49.234
- Hang in there.
- Yeah.

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:50.430
Hang in there.

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:01.839
Freeze, Tommy!
Hands in the air right now!

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:06.286
Good for you, Henry.

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:08.950
Excellent police work.

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:11.458
I'm sure you are thrilled.
Put your hands on your head.

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:14.188
- I have no weapons.
- Put your hands on your head.

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:15.854
Henry, your mother is in danger.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:18.024
No, she's not. Not anymore.

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:19.225
Hi, Emily.

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:21.293
Be quiet, Tommy.

01:22:21.369 --> 01:22:23.496
Henry, listen to me, please.

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:26.665
I knew you were following me
pretty much from the beginning.

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.641
That's why I misled you
about tonight.

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:30.177
I knew you were listening,

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:32.338
but I had to make sure
this went according to plan.

01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:33.540
Sure, sure, sure, Tommy.

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:35.515
Whatever you say,
if that's even your name.

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:36.572
Yeah, that's my...

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:39.586
Well, no, no, Lucero
is not my last name.

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:41.986
My real name
is Tomas Martínez.

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:44.048
Wanna hear your rights,
Tom Martinez?

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.888
No, I pretty much know my rights.

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.156
- Then we can skip the boring...
- Henry, Henry!

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:52.127
Jean Yves and Niko
are part of a European syndicate.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.100
This is not about
stealing some statue.

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:55.158
Sure.

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:57.761
They sell high-end goods
to finance terrorist operations.

01:22:57.839 --> 01:22:59.534
And you would know this how?

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:05.503
Henry... Emily...

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.473
I am with the CIA.

01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:13.350
Okay, now I've heard everything.

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:15.616
I was introduced
to them in Europe.

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.248
I was working
on another case.

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:19.190
When they approached me,
I couldn't say no.

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.249
I had to get involved.

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:21.761
- Sure.
- No, I've been...

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.127
Get down on the ground!

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:25.098
- If I declined...
- Get down on the ground.

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:27.930
No, no, no. Henry, I am telling you
your mother is in danger.

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:30.267
These two guys know
we are romantically involved.

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:32.533
Get down on the ground right now!

01:23:32.607 --> 01:23:34.541
Listen to me! Listen!
Look at this.

01:23:34.609 --> 01:23:38.101
They shot me.
They obviously suspect something!

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:41.273
I am the only person who knows
how they are leaving the country.

01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:43.681
If they suspect I said
anything to your mother...

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:45.617
This is a fascinating story, Tommy.

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:48.212
- Down on the ground now!
- What if he's telling the truth?

01:23:48.289 --> 01:23:50.655
Fine. I will send
a team to the house.

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:53.159
No, no, no. That will get
her killed for sure. No.

01:23:53.228 --> 01:23:56.254
We have to take them by surprise
and we have to do it ourselves.

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:57.389
Come on, kids!

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.799
You want me to give you a gun?

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.961
Well, yes, I am with the CIA.

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:06.099
Okay, well, if he's an agent,
then he's got a federal main number.

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:08.074
We've already got
his thumbprint on file.

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:09.906
Run a print. Great idea.

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:12.003
But wait, wait, wait.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.775
Where did you get my print?

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:17.015
I lifted it at the deli.

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:22.114
Nice pull, Henry. Nice pull.

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:23.179
Good, good.

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:25.920
So, if he's telling the truth,

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:27.427
then we've got a match.

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:29.520
Brilliant.
Can we do this on the way?

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:33.089
Hey, Henry? Your mother?

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.498
Okay, yes. Yes, yes.

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:39.338
Thank you. We appreciate it.

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:43.276
Looks like your mom picked a winner.
The prints match.

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:45.175
Tommy is who he says he is.

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:50.280
All right, there's a gun
in the glove compartment.

01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:52.376
- Give it to him.
- Yeah, please.

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:53.716
Thank you.

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:28.481
<i>Niko!</i>

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.403
Hello?

01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:46.173
- Hello?
<i>- Felder, it's Henry.</i>

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:48.766
- Is everything all right at the house?
- Yeah, I guess.

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:50.777
I think your mom's
watching some movie.

01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:51.937
A movie?

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:54.447
Oh, I heard some talking
and stuff breaking.

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:55.574
Oh, shit.

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:56.774
Oh, shit.

01:25:56.851 --> 01:25:58.478
Randle, wake up.

01:25:58.553 --> 01:26:00.384
You got the board.
I'm heading out.

01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:02.047
What happened? What?

01:26:20.475 --> 01:26:22.568
I think there's two guys inside.

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:25.306
I can... I can hear
your mom talking to them.

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:28.474
She's not my mom,
but thank God she's still all right.

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:30.415
What the hell's
he doing with a gun?

01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:32.214
He's in the CIA.

01:26:32.287 --> 01:26:34.118
I'm pretty sure
you've heard of it.

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:36.349
CIA.

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:44.931
Who the hell's the guy
on the front lawn?

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:47.526
Help, help!

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:52.169
You hear that?

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:55.570
He's not bad.

01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:57.110
That's Enrico.

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:59.544
He's still in love with me.
What am I supposed to do?

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:04.715
Enrico, shut up. Shut up.

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:06.310
You have to get out of here.

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:08.184
What, you're going to shoot me?

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:11.316
- Shoot me for being in love?!
- Shut up. Shut up.

01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:14.657
Love is not a crime!
It's not a crime!

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:19.792
Listen, lady, you're going to get up
very quietly and very slowly.

01:27:19.867 --> 01:27:23.098
One peep,
and I blow up your brains.

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:25.931
I'm going in there,

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:30.467
and I'm going to make sweet love
to your mother right now!

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:31.807
And I'm going to say...

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:33.039
Shit.

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:35.310
Thank you!

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:36.509
Who <i>is</i> this guy?

01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:38.814
It's a long story. Come on.

01:27:39.887 --> 01:27:41.718
Can't we just kill her and go?

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:45.591
If this Tommy Lucero
was not the man he said he was,

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.252
we are dead people back home.

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:48.317
Dead people!

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:49.886
<i>Hit her!</i>

01:27:49.964 --> 01:27:51.454
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.327
Jeany, just get her to the car.

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:56.393
Her son's in the FBI.
You want him to show up?

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:58.371
You think the house is bugged?

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.132
Oh, right.

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:04.878
It's not like anybody...
was outside!

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:08.609
- <i>We're ten feet from the front door!</i>
- Get back. You ready?

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:10.082
Let's go.

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:11.880
We are standing
in front of the couch,

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:14.513
and you two thugs
are menacing me.

01:28:16.224 --> 01:28:18.692
CIA, drop them! Both of you!

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.318
Right now! You are under arrest!

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:21.657
You're not dead.

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:23.526
I am not dead,
and I am not kidding.

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.156
Put your weapons down now!

01:28:26.267 --> 01:28:28.428
Drop your weapon
and step away from my mother!

01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:31.837
Don't you point that gun
at my fiancé.

01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:37.210
Oh, man.

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:46.181
And what part
of the family are you?

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:48.381
I'm not related to anybody.

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:50.083
I just think she's hot.

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:59.189
Marty.

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:04.364
Oh, hey, is a bad time?

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:11.376
There's certainly a lot of you,
and you're swarming.

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:12.936
Do you always swarm?

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:23.248
- Well...
- Thanks for the assist.

01:29:23.324 --> 01:29:25.258
Glad to help, sir.
Absolutely.

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:28.318
You did good on this.
I know it wasn't easy.

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:29.658
Thank you, sir.

01:29:33.101 --> 01:29:34.193
Mom.

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:37.398
Are you sure you're all right?

01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:40.533
Oh, Henry, wow.

01:29:41.542 --> 01:29:43.567
Very, very impressed by you.

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:44.941
Very aggressive.

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:48.140
Well, I had some help.

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:50.841
- Henry.
- Tommy.

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:52.078
Thank you.

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:54.014
Thank you.

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:00.851
Well...

01:30:00.928 --> 01:30:02.452
So, you're CIA.

01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:03.588
Yes, I am.

01:30:03.664 --> 01:30:07.100
Well, I <i>was.</i> I just finished.

01:30:08.102 --> 01:30:09.364
It's very James Bond.

01:30:09.437 --> 01:30:11.166
Yes, I guess.

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:14.773
Look, I have quite a bit
to explain to you.

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:16.869
Yeah.

01:30:16.944 --> 01:30:18.104
Just tell me the truth.

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:19.203
I love you.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.508
Okay.

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:21.673
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:24.547
- Okay, come here. Please.
- Okay, okay.

01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:32.522
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:30:33.861 --> 01:30:36.022
Let them have their moment.

01:30:51.446 --> 01:30:52.504
Marty!

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:55.949
I love you!

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:58.885
And I know you love me too!

01:30:58.953 --> 01:31:01.046
I know it! I know it!

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:03.920
I know, I can feel it in my body.

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:09.686
I want to make sweet love to you

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:13.256
and I want to do it... now!

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:55.700
One, two, three. Okay.

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.713
Oh, am I interrupting?

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.988
It's a party. I can make some...

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:58.992
That was not the door.

01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:12.803
Hey, you get my flowers?

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:18.037
Are you hungry?
I could make you something.

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:23.710
That was window.

01:35:29.156 --> 01:35:32.455
My back!
My back. My back!

01:35:42.503 --> 01:35:44.232
It's a good drum, huh?

01:36:04.258 --> 01:36:05.850
I just broke a string.

01:36:08.195 --> 01:36:09.423
That's right!

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:52.897
All right, we've had enough.
We gotta go work!

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:54.372
We gotta go work, everybody.

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:58.007
Can you believe this?
We're making a movie right now.
