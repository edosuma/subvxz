WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:03.002
I trust you with my...

00:03.087 --> 00:04.253
Life?

00:04.338 --> 00:05.505
- Woah.

00:05.589 --> 00:06.923
We all said it
at the same time.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.425
It's 'cause it resonated so hard.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.302
This is, like, one of
the best songs ever written.

00:11.387 --> 00:14.180
Like, better than anything that
Waka Flocka Flame's ever written.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.015
And that is saying a lot.
He is quite a penman.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.184
Wow, we're like freakin'
Taylor Swifts in this bitch.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.103
We should lay down the vocals
while it's still fresh, right?

00:20.187 --> 00:21.688
-Mmm-hmm. Oh, yeah.
-This is gonna be so cool.

00:21.772 --> 00:22.772
Like, at our next party,

00:22.856 --> 00:24.691
when a hot chick hears this song,

00:24.775 --> 00:28.361
and she's like, "Who sings this song?"

00:28.445 --> 00:29.696
And I'm like, "Me."

00:29.780 --> 00:31.155
And then she's all...

00:33.283 --> 00:35.660
And then I frickin' leave her there
to question her entire life.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.370
Except that it's us, right?

00:37.454 --> 00:39.789
Using the gear that I bought
with my gift certificate

00:39.873 --> 00:40.998
from my cousin Torbjorn.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.459
Well, my gift is my voice,

00:43.544 --> 00:45.712
so this is for you.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.047
When you need me

00:48.132 --> 00:49.549
I'll be there

00:49.633 --> 00:52.635
'Cause we're best friends

00:53.387 --> 00:56.389
When you see me,
There's no fear

00:56.473 --> 00:59.600
'Cause we're best friends

01:00.144 --> 01:01.978
And when you call me

01:02.062 --> 01:03.688
I'm gonna pick up

01:03.772 --> 01:04.814
We're best friends!

01:04.898 --> 01:06.065
Whoo!

01:06.150 --> 01:07.984
All right. Yeah.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.820
I got goose bumps.
That was pretty good.

01:18.162 --> 01:19.162
I'm fresh

01:20.789 --> 01:22.749
You gotta, you gotta, You gotta, gotta

01:22.833 --> 01:23.833
Gotta be fresh

01:27.504 --> 01:28.755
Ha-fruit-ken!

01:28.839 --> 01:31.090
Ohhh, that was a good toss.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.134
Whoa!

01:33.218 --> 01:35.094
-Nice.
-Oh, man, that's cool.

01:35.179 --> 01:37.972
What else is cool is the fact
that if I want to, like,

01:38.056 --> 01:40.349
re-record a track or, like,
add some kind of special effect,

01:40.434 --> 01:43.519
you can do it on your phone
via Bluetooth.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.480
What the... Okay.

01:45.564 --> 01:46.814
What is this?

01:46.899 --> 01:48.608
Sound like Duran Duran hit the skins

01:48.692 --> 01:50.985
with Michael Bivins and birthed a jam.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.153
Who is this?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.113
I don't like you and how you speak.

01:54.198 --> 01:56.449
It's us, believe it or not.
It's our new band, Menergy.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.117
Cool sound, huh? Pretty original?

01:58.202 --> 01:59.368
- What?
- Yeah.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.454
This is taking me back to high school
right now. Right, Bill?

02:01.538 --> 02:02.914
Buckle up, fellas,

02:02.998 --> 02:04.457
because the best part is about to come.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.917
- My part. Listen to this verse.
- Okay.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.502
I've got some great lyrics.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.795
Like I trust you

02:08.879 --> 02:10.797
-I don't hear it.
-I'm supposed to be right here, I think.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.173
Is this the bridge, or is this my part?

02:12.257 --> 02:14.342
No, I actually think this might be, um...

02:14.426 --> 02:16.177
Where you at?

02:16.261 --> 02:18.513
All right, listen up, everybody.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.264
- I have some good news.

02:20.349 --> 02:23.726
Because Jillian was so frugal
with all of our office supplies,

02:23.811 --> 02:27.563
we have a little...
Well, actually, a pretty big budget surplus.

02:28.232 --> 02:30.358
Erasable pens save on Wite-Out.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.276
You guys all read that article I sent, right?

02:32.361 --> 02:33.361
-Mmm-mmm.
-No.

02:33.445 --> 02:34.654
The one I wrote?

02:34.738 --> 02:36.155
-Nobody read that, Jillian.
-That's great.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.450
All right, so if we don't spend it,
corporate's gonna slash next year's budget,

02:39.535 --> 02:42.119
so I've decided I'm gonna
throw us a little office party.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.038
- Sick.
- Now, if you have any suggestions,

02:44.122 --> 02:45.706
please let me know.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.959
But one thing is for damn sure.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.294
We're getting a pancake station.

02:50.379 --> 02:51.462
Yeah!

02:53.090 --> 02:54.715
Alice, can we get a Velcro wall?

02:54.800 --> 02:58.719
I've always wanted to feel what it
would be like to be held and supported.

02:58.804 --> 02:59.804
By Velcro.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.181
And we definitely need to get
one of them hammer slammers.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.517
I've been doing these, uh,
Jillian Michael DVDs,

03:04.601 --> 03:07.562
and it's time to put
my "chess stremph" to the test.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.022
Let's get a batting cage.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.692
Wait till you see me bunt.
I can really lay 'em down.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.318
Okay, you know what, I'm sorry I asked.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.362
If you have any more suggestions,
just tell Jillian.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.447
-I'm out.
-I'm also out.

03:18.991 --> 03:19.991
I have an idea.

03:20.075 --> 03:23.995
How about we debut Menergy at the party?

03:24.079 --> 03:25.746
- Yes.
- Right?

03:25.831 --> 03:27.790
I mean, I always thought
it'd be the Apollo Theater,

03:27.875 --> 03:28.875
but, like, this could work.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.251
I think fate might've just stepped in.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.128
I'm psyched. This is how Metallica started.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.589
They had their first gig at,
like, a Chick-fil-A, I think.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.969
Uh, Blake, here's the deal.

03:40.137 --> 03:42.096
Adam and I got to talking.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.433
Well, we came to the conclusion
that you're off the project.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.311
So you did take me off the track.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.146
Indeed.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.439
Okay, well, that doesn't make sense.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.899
We're not a duo. We're a threesome...

03:52.983 --> 03:53.983
- Blake.
- Yeah?

03:54.526 --> 03:57.069
I don't mean to be mean or rude,

03:57.154 --> 04:00.573
but your voice is horrific sounding.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.074
It's so bad, Blake.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.493
It sounds like life leaving something.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.078
Like a child's nightmare.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.456
Remember the video
of that pit bull that got shot?

04:08.540 --> 04:09.540
It was like, "Bang!" It was like...

04:12.836 --> 04:14.211
Shut up! Shut up, all right?

04:14.504 --> 04:15.963
You guys back-stabbed me, all right?

04:16.048 --> 04:17.048
You betrayed me.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.633
You frickin' ripped my heart out,

04:18.717 --> 04:22.053
and you basically just threw it in the trash
and lit it on fire and spit on it, man.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.180
-I got to take a walk.
-Okay.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.974
The irony is, the way that he
described what we did to him?

04:27.059 --> 04:28.351
-That's what his voice sounds like.
-Yeah.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.104
Alice
We want to

04:32.189 --> 04:34.357
Ask you...
What is he doing here?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.275
Blake finally had a good idea.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.362
He's gonna do a little musical
performance at the office party.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.780
What?

04:40.864 --> 04:43.199
That's the reason that...

04:43.283 --> 04:44.617
It's okay.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.078
You know, it's so funny, Blake,
but I never knew you were in a band.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.080
-Yeah?
-Yeah, and it's "Rapping Wizards."

04:49.456 --> 04:50.456
Wow.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.042
I mean, even if it isn't good,
you know, it'll be fun to laugh at.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.460
- Yeah.
- So...

04:54.544 --> 04:55.586
Worth a chuckle.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.341
Okay, please get the eff
out of my office now.

05:01.510 --> 05:02.843
Excuse me.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.018
Blake, you get back here. You can't do this.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.521
-The Wizards... It's our thing.
-Oh, yeah?

05:13.814 --> 05:16.524
Well, Menergy was our thing too,
but you kicked me out of that,

05:16.608 --> 05:18.317
so I'm kicking you out of The Wizards.

05:18.402 --> 05:21.153
You mess with the dragon's fire,
you get scorched, ya bitch.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.739
- Bye-bye!
- No, not bye-bye, okay?

05:24.074 --> 05:26.158
'Cause I'm only scared of two things.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.828
-Pincher bugs is one of them...
-That's legit.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.622
...and the other is pleasing
a woman to death with my penis.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.458
Now I realize it wasn't that big,
so that was an irrational fear.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.252
But now I'm frickin' scared of you, my man.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.963
'Cause you're a snake,
and you snaked our gig.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.548
- Good to know.
- He's scared, and I'm laughing,

05:40.632 --> 05:43.801
because I think it's hilarious that you think
you can do The Wizards without us.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.344
My whole butt is cracking off over here.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.179
No, that's true, Blazer. It is.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.473
He frickin' has a giant crack right up his butt.

05:49.558 --> 05:50.516
-Yeah.
-It's true.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.351
- That's great.
- Moon him. Moon him, Ders.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.103
- Do not moon me. Not here.
- Frickin' moon him.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.771
- Look at it.

05:55.856 --> 05:56.939
Look at that.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.443
You think you can moon me
without consequences? Huh? Do you?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.862
Why are you doing a freaking
Bruce Willis voice right now?

06:03.155 --> 06:05.406
'Cause I'm serious, all right?

06:06.533 --> 06:07.575
Dead serious.

06:08.285 --> 06:11.412
Well, buckle up, you backstabbers,
'cause I got to go rehearse.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.541
You're gonna see one heck of
a Wizard performance tomorrow.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.127
And you're not gonna be part of it.

06:19.463 --> 06:20.838
Oh, this ain't happening,

06:20.922 --> 06:22.757
because what that snake Blake doesn't realize

06:22.841 --> 06:25.217
is that he just awakened a mongoose.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.305
Hell yeah.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.100
What's... I don't know what a mongoose is.

06:33.185 --> 06:36.562
-That's a snake?
-It's a dope ferret that can kill snakes.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.523
That was a snake.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.484
Dude, your voice is awesome, man.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.402
It's just like... It's really unique.

06:43.487 --> 06:47.448
You just need, like, really awesome talent
to be holding you up,

06:47.574 --> 06:48.908
which is why we have these puppets.

06:48.992 --> 06:52.495
Karl, that is why you are
my only real friend, all right?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.789
Because you don't turn your back on me ever.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.874
-Frickin' wolf pack for life, bro.
-Dude.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.042
Swee!

06:58.126 --> 06:59.794
I wish you were my dad sometimes.

06:59.878 --> 07:00.878
- Cool. Yeah.
- I really do.

07:00.962 --> 07:01.962
I wish you didn't live in a van.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.589
- It's always hot. I'm hot right now.
- That's fair.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.508
Yeah, sorry. The AC is busted.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.718
Here, I'm gonna just drink some of this juice.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.679
God... What is this?
Is this homemade?

07:10.931 --> 07:13.057
--Oh, no! No!

07:13.183 --> 07:16.310
- Oh, my God, what is... What is that?

07:16.812 --> 07:18.771
That's a homemade
super-stink bomb, dude.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.024
-What?
-That's filled with so much nasty stuff, man.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.694
Like raw poop, human poop, raccoon poop,

07:25.779 --> 07:27.780
my poop, Velveeta cheese,

07:27.864 --> 07:30.199
and, uh, fermented Grumpy Grape Squeezit.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.243
- I thought it was kombucha.
- No.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.453
Oh, Karl, why? Why?

07:34.538 --> 07:37.248
Dude, I make 'em, and I sell it to bad kids.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.500
No, I get that.
And you're expanding your portfolio.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.378
You're getting very wise in your old age.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.215
Allow me and my friends
to give you a round of applause.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.050
--Oh, my God.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.426
The human genius, you guys.
Here he is.

07:49.511 --> 07:50.511
That's awesome.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.057
You got to be kidding me. He thinks
he can replace us with some puppets?

07:55.517 --> 07:57.351
You've got to be kidding me.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.811
-All right, let's go.
-Okay.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.479
No, this way, dude.

08:06.736 --> 08:10.447
- One, two, three, yes. Kick, kick.
- One and two and three and four and

08:10.532 --> 08:14.243
-five and six and seven and eight.
-You know who it be. It's that crazy-ass mage.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.661
- Crazy-ass!
- Crazy-ass mage.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.288
- Was that pretty good? Like this?
- It's great.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.831
- It feels great!
- It looks like... It's awesome.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.916
--And suck my frickin' balls, dude.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.001
-Yes. Yes.
-What the...

08:22.752 --> 08:25.296
Police! Come out from behind the van now.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.631
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Oh, no way!

08:27.716 --> 08:28.716
-No way.
-What's going on?

08:28.800 --> 08:29.925
We don't have to do what you say.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.010
-Hey...
-No! Fuck you!

08:31.094 --> 08:33.053
Karl, shut up, dude. They got guns, man.

08:33.138 --> 08:36.056
No, dude. I've been profiled two times
in the last eight years.

08:36.141 --> 08:38.934
- I'm done with you pigs!
- This is not a fucking game!

08:39.019 --> 08:40.519
Drop the pipes or I will shoot you!

08:40.604 --> 08:41.979
That's not necessary, Officer.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.522
Chill! Put the gun down!

08:43.607 --> 08:44.773
- You in the middle.
- Yes.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.359
Step forward, lay on the ground,
and put your hands behind your back.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.528
Yes, of course. Yes, I'm...

08:49.613 --> 08:50.738
Whoa, back the fuck up!

08:50.822 --> 08:54.283
- Whoa! Stop, dude! Please!
- We said just the man in the middle.

08:54.451 --> 08:55.534
I got the ugly one on the left.

08:55.619 --> 08:56.619
Fuck.

08:56.703 --> 09:00.206
-Say the word, I'll blow his head off.
-Doug, please stop. Please?

09:00.290 --> 09:02.208
Please, all right?
I'm gonna unhook my puppet.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.626
- They're reaching for their weapons!
- What?

09:03.710 --> 09:04.919
--They're reaching for their weapons!

09:05.003 --> 09:07.004
-Oh, shit! Okay!
-Ooh! Ooh!

09:07.088 --> 09:08.047
What is wrong
with this guy?

09:08.131 --> 09:11.133
You shot an innocent puppet!
I want your badge number now!

09:11.259 --> 09:13.719
That's... Ooh, you fucked up.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.304
Jesus Christ, Doug!

09:15.388 --> 09:17.097
I told you to keep the weapons holstered.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.724
Okay, sorry.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.144
We'll call this one even.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.355
I'm sure you got drugs in that van, so...

09:24.439 --> 09:26.857
Yeah, yes, I have a lot of drugs in here.

09:26.942 --> 09:27.942
Yes, we'll call it even.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.819
Blake! Oh, my God, are you okay?

09:30.904 --> 09:33.489
I just called the cops,
and then I heard a gunshot.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.824
-Gunshot?
-Why did you call the cops?

09:35.951 --> 09:39.245
Adam and Anders said that someone pulled
you in a shady van... Which is right here.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.621
Shady? This is my home.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.914
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.125
I was just out here rehearsing
for the thing tomorrow, okay?

09:45.252 --> 09:46.919
Wasn't in any shady vans.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.922
Wait, on company time?
Blake, go home, okay?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.757
And don't think about coming
back here tomorrow,

09:51.841 --> 09:53.801
- because you are suspended.
- No!

09:53.885 --> 09:55.094
Go make your puppets
somewhere else.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.221
- I was just shot at by cops!
- Yeah.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.139
-But then there won't be a band to perform...
-Yeah.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.683
- You know what?
- But! Yeah?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.309
I have a good idea.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.603
What if our band performed tomorrow?

10:04.688 --> 10:07.022
It's a cool emo band
that we started called Menergy.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.565
-What do you say?
-Fine.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.943
Sure. Play. Who cares?

10:11.486 --> 10:12.486
Yes!

10:13.697 --> 10:14.655
Wait.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.573
- Oh, this'll feel good.
- What are they doing?

10:16.658 --> 10:18.367
Oh, no. Hell no. Hell no.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.202
-Hey, hey, hey, chill. Chill, man, chill.
-No. No.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.787
- They're just butts, bro.
- Let me go!

10:21.871 --> 10:23.080
- Just chill.
- It isn't over!

10:23.164 --> 10:24.707
It's just skin.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.333
It's not. It's butt skin.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.129
DeMamp, let's go.
You can do your hair in the car.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.672
We got a sound check in 15.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.299
-Hey.
-What?

10:33.425 --> 10:35.843
Before you leave, I just want
to apologize for yesterday.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.803
I was just acting like a weirdo...

10:37.887 --> 10:40.222
I don't want to cut you off,
but I've been waiting for that.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.807
-Thank you.
-You know, I should've just known.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.268
You and Adam have always worked
so well together, and...

10:44.352 --> 10:45.311
Well, I'll be honest.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.855
Working with you would be a dream
compared to working with that guy.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.481
It's like he doesn't understand.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.525
I am the brains of the operation.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.985
He's just a diva.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.988
I know what works and what doesn't,
you know?

10:56.072 --> 10:57.740
Take care. Adam!

10:57.991 --> 10:59.116
S'go!

11:00.577 --> 11:02.161
You got it. Break a leg.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.370
"Adam, let's go.
Adam, let's go."

11:03.455 --> 11:04.997
-Hey.
-Dude, how does my hair look?

11:05.081 --> 11:06.874
Come here. Let me...

11:07.083 --> 11:08.834
You know, it's weird that Ders
doesn't even, like, realize

11:08.918 --> 11:10.794
how important this kind of stuff is, you know?

11:10.879 --> 11:12.463
Him being, like, the leader
of the band and stuff.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.381
You'd think he'd know a little bit about...

11:14.466 --> 11:17.009
-Did he say that?
-Yeah, no. He said he's the leader of the band.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.594
-He said he's the leader?
-Yeah.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.555
Okay.

11:21.806 --> 11:26.393
If this were a cartoon, there'd be
freaking fire in my eyeballs right now.

11:27.979 --> 11:32.024
Blake, between me and you,
there is no band without me,

11:32.108 --> 11:35.694
Adam, the freakin' star of all stars, DeMamp.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.780
-Yeah.
-It's like we're the band Everclear.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.073
I'm Art Alexakis.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.075
He's Craig Montoya and Greg Eklund.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.327
Don't you ever, ever, ever forget about me,

11:43.411 --> 11:45.871
even when you're super famous
and up on top, okay?

11:46.122 --> 11:49.041
Blake, I have the memory of an elephant.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.043
I don't forget nothing.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.089
I forgot pants.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.551
Let's do this.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.805
Ha! That one slipped. Stop trippin'.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.558
Wow. This is so real.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.726
Yep.

12:07.811 --> 12:11.605
Showtime's in one hour, so we need to be
very careful with what we do to our bodies.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.982
Pancakes are ready!

12:15.276 --> 12:17.986
Carbo load. Yes!

12:18.238 --> 12:19.738
Excuse me. Talent coming through.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.782
-Move, bidge. Get out of my way.
-Talent first. Talent first.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.242
-Dude, I'm gonna hit...
-Thank you.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.077
...so many beautiful notes
when I'm full of food.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.370
That's how I do.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.081
- I freakin' fill up with food, and I exude talent.

12:29.165 --> 12:32.835
Hey, and you know what, I could really go
for some of that golden brown sauce.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.503
Oh, this? The good good.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.798
- Yummy, yummy. Yowza.
- Gonna get you some. Get me some.

12:37.882 --> 12:38.966
I'm excited about today.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.259
-I am too.
-To Menergy.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.845
Let's get menergized.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.888
- Right?
- Yeah.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.561
- These are weird-tasting.
- What is that?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.021
It's Blake.

12:53.982 --> 12:57.151
Hi. How was your pancakes?

12:57.694 --> 12:58.777
Blake, where are you?

12:58.862 --> 12:59.945
It's the pancakes.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.655
Did he just... What'd he do to the pancakes?

13:01.739 --> 13:03.824
You tell you what you did
to these pancakes right now.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.493
What didn't I do
to the pancakes?

13:07.162 --> 13:10.622
I... Actually, I just switched
the syrup with teriyaki.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.293
No, no. You guys! It's not syrup, it's teriyaki.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.502
You can't eat the pancakes.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.379
It's teriyaki?

13:18.548 --> 13:20.466
It's actually not bad
when you know what it is.

13:26.723 --> 13:27.723
What?

13:28.391 --> 13:32.686
Oh, boys, it's a shame
Alice is gonna have to cancel the mixer.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.688
It's actually not a mixer, Blake.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.900
If anything, it's like a office party
or a brunch with activities,

13:37.984 --> 13:39.359
and why would Alice cancel it?

13:39.444 --> 13:42.029
Okay, well, here's one pitch why.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.907
-He's got a pitch.
-Okay, what is it?

13:45.366 --> 13:48.076
No, it... That... It's a pun, okay?

13:48.578 --> 13:49.912
Just look at the pitching machine, man.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.538
- What do you mean, it's...
- All right, hit it.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.334
My eyes!

13:55.919 --> 13:58.337
- Who put fruit in the ball return?

13:58.421 --> 14:01.465
- Here he is. Blake, what's up, man?

14:02.008 --> 14:03.050
What's your end game?

14:03.218 --> 14:05.761
There is no end game, Adam. All right?

14:07.597 --> 14:09.306
Now stick around.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.308
- Stick around. Make sure to stick around.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.852
-Stick around, like...
-Hold me in your arms, Mother Velcro!

14:15.313 --> 14:16.313
-The Velcro wall.
-Velcro wall!

14:16.481 --> 14:19.525
What's happening? Oh, God. Help. Help!

14:19.609 --> 14:21.360
-It's deflating!
-Jillian?

14:21.444 --> 14:22.903
- Help!
- We'll get you out!

14:23.279 --> 14:25.906
Oh, dear God, it's swallowing me whole.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.367
Jillian, I know it's hard, but
you have to work with me here.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.577
--Alice, you really got to...

14:30.662 --> 14:31.954
--What is that? Is that my skin?

14:32.038 --> 14:33.038
- No, it's just Velcro.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.957
Stop screaming in my ear!

14:38.586 --> 14:40.712
Oh, my panties are out.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.589
Okay, that was kind of anti-climactic.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.674
-Come on.
-All right.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.008
Hey, you see this?

14:45.093 --> 14:46.426
Still got "teriyoki" on my fingers.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.179
--What the...

14:49.639 --> 14:51.557
It's Blake. He's here.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.019
- You're on speakerphone.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.813
-What's up? Adam's here.
-It's Adam and Ders.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.314
And listen up, okay?

14:59.399 --> 15:02.568
It's Menergy's big day, and you are ruining it,
because you're freaking our crowd out.

15:02.652 --> 15:03.735
Oh, I'm sorry, Ders.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.488
Am I sapping all the Menergy from you guys?

15:06.739 --> 15:10.033
Oh, I hope you have the "skremph"
to play the gig.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.327
Otherwise, it's really gonna stink.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.997
Who says stupid stuff like "skremph?"

15:15.957 --> 15:18.166
I'm like Thor's uncle up in here.

15:18.793 --> 15:19.793
Oh!

15:20.295 --> 15:21.503
Damn it!

15:21.629 --> 15:22.671
No! No!

15:26.718 --> 15:28.343
Drop the hammer!

15:39.856 --> 15:41.189
-Got it!
-Nice.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.108
Oh!
I've always wanted to hold a hammer like this.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.192
-That was close.
-That was cool, right?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.695
Hey, don't you see me trying to ring this bell
like Bart Simpson's neck?

15:46.779 --> 15:47.988
Well, it's a good thing you didn't. Look.

15:48.072 --> 15:51.658
One of Karl's classic homemade stink bombs.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.076
- Whatever.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.536
It's Blake.

15:57.332 --> 16:00.000
Congratulations. You stopped Tez.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.419
But I've got more up my sleeve.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.629
Sleeve. Rip your sleeves off.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.297
-No. No, Adam, stop it.
-He did something to our sleeves.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.007
-He did something to our sleeves.
-Adam, you heard him.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.258
Stop it. Didn't you hear him?

16:08.718 --> 16:10.636
He knows we stopped Tez. He can see us.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.014
- I spotted him.
- Where? Where?

16:14.223 --> 16:16.808
- Where?
- He's on the roof over there.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.602
Go, go, go, go.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.020
Blake, you hold it right there.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.649
-Oh!
-Owie.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.905
Karl? What are you doing?

16:30.031 --> 16:32.991
I'll never tell you, 'cause you hurt
my best friend Blake's feelings.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.117
Oh, you won't tell us?

16:34.243 --> 16:36.078
Ow! Ow! It's glued to my head. Stop!

16:36.162 --> 16:38.205
-Where is he?
-Stop! Ow, dude.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.502
- Oh!
- Well, hello.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.297
You know what? I'm gonna just jump
off of here and kill myself.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.299
That way I don't have to see
your stupid performance again.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.634
No, that's where you're wrong, Blake,

16:50.718 --> 16:55.097
'cause you're gonna have to see our
performance over and over and over again,

16:55.181 --> 16:57.015
forever, starting now.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.684
Get your butt out of my face!

17:05.274 --> 17:06.692
-Showtime.
-Yeah.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.485
Sit tight, you bizznatch.

17:08.695 --> 17:12.447
Hello, TelAmeriCorp, and any other
offices out there that can hear us.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.117
We are Menergy.

17:15.243 --> 17:18.578
Let's get menergized!

17:18.663 --> 17:20.080
- Whoo!

17:22.375 --> 17:25.293
When you need me,
I'll be there

17:25.378 --> 17:28.088
'Cause we're best friends

17:29.298 --> 17:32.217
When you see me,
There's no fear

17:32.301 --> 17:34.469
'Cause we're best friends

17:36.055 --> 17:38.807
Do you trust me like I trust you?

17:38.891 --> 17:42.686
I don't care who overhears our conversation

17:43.938 --> 17:46.440
It's like he doesn't understand.
I'm the brains of the operation.

17:46.524 --> 17:47.524
Wait, what?

17:47.608 --> 17:49.901
There is no band without me, Adam.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.069
What the hell is that? What are you saying?

17:51.320 --> 17:52.696
Well, you just said something first.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.030
He's just a diva.

17:54.115 --> 17:57.325
I'm the diva? Look how hard your hair is
right now. I'm the diva?

17:57.535 --> 17:59.703
Hey, I wake up like this. You want to get real?

17:59.787 --> 18:03.415
We both know Menergy wouldn't exist
without me, the brains.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.751
Okay, I'm the talent of the operation.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.461
I thought you guys were friends.

18:07.545 --> 18:10.756
Like how every line of your song
is about being friends?

18:10.840 --> 18:12.549
-Yeah, we're friends, Bill.
-We're friends, okay?

18:12.633 --> 18:14.009
This is a spat between friends.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.761
ADAM.. Kind of like the band Everclear.

18:15.845 --> 18:19.264
I'm Art Alexakis.
He's Craig Montoya and Greg Eklund.

18:19.348 --> 18:22.642
Okay, let me be ever so clear about this.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.102
You are no Art Alexakis.

18:24.187 --> 18:27.022
I'm totally Art Alexakis, and I told Blake that...
Okay.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.952
Quite the performance, gentlemen.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.788
And I had the perfect seats.

18:42.997 --> 18:47.083
Front side stage, right within range of your
stupid little Bluetooth beat machine.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.169
Oh, my God, he wanted us to catch him.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.670
No, what I...

18:50.755 --> 18:53.006
What I wanted... I'll tell you.

18:54.801 --> 18:59.387
What I wanted was to rock and roll
onstage with my friends, okay?

18:59.722 --> 19:02.474
We've established
that you're talentless, okay?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.309
And it's your voice, and it's horrible,

19:04.393 --> 19:05.894
and it was sort of a business decision.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.981
Yeah, all right.
I will admit, I have a very bad singing voice.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.983
-Very bad. It's very, very bad.
-So bad.

19:12.068 --> 19:15.570
How would you feel if, you know,
Ders and I left you out of the project?

19:15.822 --> 19:20.116
You guys wouldn't do that,
because I am a natural-born performer,

19:20.201 --> 19:21.451
and I'm the best singer of the crew.

19:21.536 --> 19:22.828
Yeah, that's true.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.120
You're in no matter what.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.957
But, Ders, what about you?
What if Adam and I left you out?

19:27.458 --> 19:29.709
Uh, you guys do that all the time.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.211
And it does feel pretty bad.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.296
Look, I have a terrible voice.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.716
Even my deaf friend from high school, Terrell,
he would tell me, like, you know,

19:36.801 --> 19:39.135
"Don't quit your day job."

19:40.930 --> 19:42.514
You could speak sign language?

19:42.598 --> 19:45.058
Yeah, yeah, yeah. A little. Little.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.309
Little bit.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.941
We've got respect for each other

19:53.067 --> 19:56.444
We will protect one another

19:56.571 --> 20:00.156
Don't waste your breath on the haters

20:00.408 --> 20:03.660
They're jealous of our friendship

20:06.914 --> 20:08.290
Friends till the end

20:08.457 --> 20:10.458
Ride or die,
Best friends

20:10.835 --> 20:13.461
I'll trust you with my life

20:13.713 --> 20:15.338
Friends till the end

20:15.506 --> 20:17.549
Ride or die,
Best friends

20:17.717 --> 20:20.886
I'll trust you with my life

20:21.137 --> 20:22.721
- All right, thank you guys so much.
- Thank you.

20:22.805 --> 20:23.972
- Stay menergized!
- All right.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.432
- Took it to church!
- Thank you.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.226
- Thanks.
- Whoo! We are Menergy.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.603
--That was so fun.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.271
I'm sorry, what the hell are you doing here?

20:31.355 --> 20:34.733
He's jamming with his friends, which,
last time I checked, ain't a crime.

20:34.817 --> 20:38.194
Actually, the last time I checked, he's not
supposed to be here, so you know what?

20:38.279 --> 20:39.738
Neither should you. Why don't you go home?

20:40.781 --> 20:42.365
Let's go smoke weed about it?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.659
-Let's do it. Oh, hey, guys?
-Yeah.

20:45.328 --> 20:46.494
Thank you.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.163
- Yes, and...
- Thank you.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.373
One, two, three, four!

20:57.006 --> 20:58.757
That's all, folks!

21:05.514 --> 21:08.058
Is this a video, or is this a picture?

21:08.184 --> 21:09.351
-All right!
-Yeah!

21:10.353 --> 21:11.853
-All right.
-We got the shot.
