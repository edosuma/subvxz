00:50.425 --> 00:52.814
Oh, Mr Barrow, you're back.

00:52.866 --> 00:56.552
I'm afraid you've missed luncheon,
but you're in time to help upstairs.

00:56.566 --> 00:59.729
Maybe there's something left.
Don't bother. I'm not hungry.

00:59.730 --> 01:02.662
Charming as ever!
How's your father doing?

01:02.677 --> 01:06.147
Oh, much better, as it happens. In
fact, he's quite well again.

01:06.162 --> 01:08.233
That's good news.
Yes. It is.

01:11.088 --> 01:13.915
You remember we're meeting Mr Wavell
at three? Pip's Corner.

01:13.916 --> 01:16.958
Yes, but I don't see the point in
it, since I'm not going to agree.

01:16.992 --> 01:19.268
He's driven all the way from Leeds.

01:19.272 --> 01:22.778
I had a letter from your father.
He says he's in London for a visit.

01:22.779 --> 01:25.680
Shrimpie's in England?
Have you made any plans to see him?

01:25.723 --> 01:28.988
Not yet. He wonders if you might let
him stay here.

01:29.004 --> 01:30.938
Of course, whenever he wants.

01:30.970 --> 01:33.029
Is Susan with him?
No.

01:33.053 --> 01:36.091
Their time's up soon and she
couldn't face another voyage.

01:36.098 --> 01:38.886
Where will they send him, do you
think? After Bombay.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.949
How are your Russians getting on?

01:43.959 --> 01:46.039
Oh, it's so sad.

01:46.040 --> 01:51.149
They talk about the old days -
dances at the Winter Palace,
picnics on the banks of the Neva -

01:51.160 --> 01:54.744
but there are holes in their shoes,
and they've got no money for food.

01:54.756 --> 01:57.270
This is where Tom says it serves them
right.

01:57.286 --> 02:00.150
Well, I don't approve of how things
were managed in Russia,

02:00.151 --> 02:03.844
but I'm still sorry for people who have
to make a new life in a foreign land.

02:03.857 --> 02:07.851
Honestly, Papa, every time you challenge
Tom, you sound much more
unreasonable than he is.

02:07.852 --> 02:09.517
Do I?

02:09.526 --> 02:12.656
How's your old beau managing, Mama?
Prince Thingummyjig.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.714
He is not my old beau.

02:15.726 --> 02:19.105
Your father would have called out
any man who said such a thing.

02:19.120 --> 02:22.203
Even so, I do hope you see him
again. Poor old boy.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.241
You don't know anything about it.

02:28.945 --> 02:30.905
How far would the houses stretch?

02:30.906 --> 02:32.853
Well, the whole field, really.

02:34.054 --> 02:37.043
But why can't they be built in a
row, like the other streets?

02:37.044 --> 02:41.596
They'd sell more quickly as
separate dwellings, and we'd
get a percentage of the sales.

02:41.597 --> 02:44.878
So, we're paid once, and in return
the field is lost,

02:44.886 --> 02:49.153
the village is spoiled and Mr Wavell
moves on in search of his next victim.

02:58.207 --> 03:00.721
Why didn't you tell them we were
coming here today?

03:00.771 --> 03:03.445
Oh... They'll find out as soon as
Rose gets home.

03:03.469 --> 03:06.757
I didn't want to be a 'topic' for
the rest of luncheon.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.694
But what are we here for'?

03:08.739 --> 03:11.721
Well, somethings been troubling me.

03:11.722 --> 03:15.666
Oh, why on earth didn't we get a
taxi from the station?

03:15.667 --> 03:17.536
We must be mad.

03:17.537 --> 03:20.179
Well, we'll get a taxi home - that's
for sure.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.116
It's saying it's in the crypt.

03:27.675 --> 03:31.509
Oh, Isobel, I didn't think it would
be like this.

03:31.526 --> 03:33.346
No, neither did I.

03:44.852 --> 03:48.652
Aunt Violet? Mrs Crawley?
You never said you were coming.

03:48.654 --> 03:50.509
We wanted to surprise you.

03:50.541 --> 03:53.454
Well, you've succeeded.

03:54.327 --> 03:56.295
Ah, there he is.

03:58.518 --> 04:01.783
I must be the last person you
expected to see.

04:01.792 --> 04:03.726
No. I thought you would come.

04:06.026 --> 04:08.734
I've brought my cousin, Mrs Crawley.

04:09.866 --> 04:12.119
Do you remember Rostov?

04:12.123 --> 04:14.103
Count Rostov, I think.

04:14.129 --> 04:16.928
Thank you. Yes. Please, ladies.
Please.

04:19.985 --> 04:25.812
I'm sorry I didn't say very much...

04:25.813 --> 04:27.645
Thank you... at Downton.

04:27.675 --> 04:30.372
But I was... I was so surprised.

04:32.572 --> 04:35.576
You haven't changed. I have.

04:35.607 --> 04:37.348
It's true.

04:37.359 --> 04:41.432
Then, you were the young and
beautiful Countess of Grantham,

04:41.439 --> 04:46.434
turning eyes in a ballroom or out in
your carriage.

04:46.454 --> 04:51.528
Now you are the great lady -
imperious, magnificent.

04:52.546 --> 04:55.515
But these are two sides of the same
coin.

04:55.516 --> 04:59.089
Your life has not much altered in
half a century.

04:59.837 --> 05:01.631
It doesn't seem so to me.

05:01.632 --> 05:06.331
Whereas the handsome and powerful
Prince Kuragin,

05:06.364 --> 05:10.335
with his thousands of acres and his
golden palaces...

05:12.578 --> 05:15.127
That man does not exist. Not any
more.

05:17.365 --> 05:21.268
Ah, Mr Molesley. I've put out some
silver to be cleaned.

05:21.297 --> 05:23.322
I'd be grateful if you could see to
it.

05:23.352 --> 05:26.276
Very good, Mr Carson.
I was looking for Mr Barrow.

05:26.289 --> 05:28.030
He's gone out.
Precisely.

05:28.043 --> 05:30.967
But then I thought: No.
This is down to Mr Molesley.

05:30.975 --> 05:33.057
After all, he is the First Footman.

05:35.787 --> 05:37.744
Oh...

05:44.309 --> 05:48.883
I have thought a good deal about
what you said the other day,

05:48.911 --> 05:51.630
when I asked after the Princess.

05:51.649 --> 05:54.337
That I don't know how or where she
is?

05:54.338 --> 05:56.306
It's true.

05:58.180 --> 06:00.899
We were arrested together,

06:00.913 --> 06:06.682
and when I came out of prison, I heard
she'd been exiled a year earlier.

06:06.716 --> 06:09.879
There must be someone in authority
who - Who?

06:09.890 --> 06:12.455
The Soviet Ambassador.

06:12.456 --> 06:17.405
Do you think he cares where Princess
Irina Kuragin is presently lodged?

06:17.419 --> 06:19.607
Well, what about the Foreign Office?

06:19.608 --> 06:22.954
Do they help the losing side in any
revolution? No.

06:22.970 --> 06:24.916
You mustn't give up hope.

06:24.945 --> 06:27.746
When you go through a storm like
ours,

06:27.747 --> 06:31.251
you give up hope quite early on in
the proceedings.

06:31.260 --> 06:38.269
I agree. Hope is a tease, designed
to prevent us accepting reality.

06:38.274 --> 06:40.424
Oh, you only say that to sound
clever.

06:40.428 --> 06:42.396
I know.

06:42.437 --> 06:44.371
You should try it.

06:50.625 --> 06:54.061
I want to call on the blacksmith.
I'll see you back at the house.

06:58.246 --> 07:00.294
Mrs Patmore?

07:00.315 --> 07:03.137
Oh, good afternoon, m'lord. M'lady.

07:05.432 --> 07:07.412
I wish I knew what that was about.

07:08.041 --> 07:11.443
And why the funny look when I asked
after Shrimpie at luncheon?

07:11.453 --> 07:15.139
I suspect he's come to tell Rose
they're getting a divorce.

07:15.147 --> 07:18.128
Are you serious?
I'm afraid so.

07:18.140 --> 07:20.222
He's hinted at it in his letters,
apparently,

07:20.235 --> 07:22.237
and I gather things have not been
improving.

07:22.238 --> 07:24.000
That's the end of his career.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.412
Well, the Martboroughs have survived
divorce.

07:26.432 --> 07:30.650
Well, the Martboroughs are very
rich. Shrimpie hasn't got a bean.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.853
People will drop them like hot
potatoes.

07:32.860 --> 07:36.661
Will we drop Shrimpie?
Susan's your cousin, not him.

07:36.662 --> 07:38.949
No, I won't take sides, whatever
Susan wants.

07:48.159 --> 07:50.093
Would you give me a hand with these?

07:52.537 --> 07:55.706
When are you leaving? Lady Mary
wants to get the eight o'clock.

07:55.707 --> 07:59.158
She's going to a dress show with
Lady Rosamund in the afternoon.

07:59.173 --> 08:01.119
I'll miss you.
So I should hope.

08:03.654 --> 08:06.840
Are you all right? I hope you
haven't let the sergeant worry you.

08:06.860 --> 08:08.806
No, he doesn't worry me.

08:10.504 --> 08:12.916
I just wish we could all forget
about Mr Green.

08:18.145 --> 08:20.603
Why did you want me to go with you
today?

08:22.446 --> 08:26.337
Oh, it was just in case things
turned mawkish.

08:27.249 --> 08:30.935
I prevent Lord Merton saying
anything to embarrass you -

08:30.949 --> 08:33.145
I wanted the same protection myself.

08:33.159 --> 08:38.269
I presume you and Prince Kuragin
were once... attracted to each other.

08:38.272 --> 08:41.344
'Attracted to each other'?
Is that what you call it?

08:42.962 --> 08:47.751
As it happens, he asked me to run
away with him.

08:47.752 --> 08:52.656
But you didn't go. No, Lord Grantham
gave me a frame by Faberge,

08:52.680 --> 08:57.265
with two pictures of the children in
it, and I saw sense.

08:57.283 --> 09:00.127
Lord Grantham sounds rather more
subtle than I'd realised.

09:00.143 --> 09:02.612
Well, like all Englishmen of his
type.

09:02.629 --> 09:07.112
He hid his qualities beneath a thick
blanket of convention,

09:07.124 --> 09:10.847
so I didn't see who he really was at
first.

09:10.848 --> 09:12.737
It was lucky you found out in time.

09:13.525 --> 09:15.607
If it was in time.

09:15.650 --> 09:17.994
I forget.

09:19.323 --> 09:23.339
Daisy! Will you put those bally
books away and come and help?

09:23.374 --> 09:25.240
And where are the pastry casings?

09:25.247 --> 09:27.818
I'll make them now.
You should have made them before!

09:27.826 --> 09:31.421
What is all that? I'm studying the
Glorious Revolution of 1688.

09:31.434 --> 09:35.041
Well, there'll be a glorious revolution
down here, if you don't watch it!

09:35.050 --> 09:36.927
Did you hear that in there?

09:36.956 --> 09:40.938
I mean, mathematics is one thing. She's
studying to be a revolutionary now!

09:41.501 --> 09:45.028
I hope there's no cooking going on
up in your room.

09:45.044 --> 09:48.469
I should find out what he's up to.
I'm sure it's nothing.

10:11.302 --> 10:12.865
Lord Merton?

10:12.866 --> 10:15.892
Oh! I er... Well, that is...

10:17.856 --> 10:19.711
You're here.

10:19.724 --> 10:22.102
Well, hadn't you better come in?
Thank you.

10:26.369 --> 10:28.224
Well, how can I help?

10:36.851 --> 10:39.127
I nearly flunked it,

10:39.143 --> 10:41.635
but I've put it off so many times,

10:41.655 --> 10:45.159
and as I was sitting all alone at
luncheon today, I just thought:

10:45.179 --> 10:47.898
'No. I'm jolly well going over there
to say it.'

10:47.914 --> 10:50.508
I do hope this won't be something
you'll regret.

10:50.514 --> 10:52.346
You may regret it. I won't.

10:57.378 --> 10:59.335
Very well. I'm listening.

11:01.232 --> 11:04.930
I really should go down on one knee,
but I fear I'd never get up again.

11:07.431 --> 11:11.573
I'm sure you realise by now - I'm
asking for your hand in marriage.

11:13.099 --> 11:14.737
Dear Lord Merton, you see -

11:14.746 --> 11:16.828
Please. Please.

11:19.893 --> 11:22.510
I want to be quite dear.

11:22.535 --> 11:26.130
I'm not speaking out of loneliness
or with a view to my comfort.

11:26.140 --> 11:29.258
I'm sure -
No, you're not.

11:30.936 --> 11:34.744
When men of my age marry, that's
usually the reason.

11:34.745 --> 11:37.461
But my proposal is a romantic one.

11:37.462 --> 11:41.148
I state freely and proudly, Isobel,
that I have fallen in love with you.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.198
And I want to spend what remains of
my life in your company.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.590
I believe I could make you happy.

11:48.607 --> 11:52.623
At any rate, I... I should very much
like the chance to try.

11:54.936 --> 11:56.779
Well, goodness, Lord Merton...

11:58.757 --> 12:01.249
I freely admit you have taken me by
surprise.

12:03.561 --> 12:07.703
Not with your proposal, but with
your... talk of love.

12:08.904 --> 12:10.861
I mean it.

12:12.056 --> 12:13.922
And before you refuse me...

12:15.132 --> 12:18.614
...I'd like to ask you to leave it on
the table, so to speak.

12:18.642 --> 12:20.747
Say nothing for the time being.

12:20.748 --> 12:23.312
Just think about it.

12:23.331 --> 12:26.164
I'm not sure it would change my
answer,

12:26.175 --> 12:28.792
but after such eloquence,

12:28.821 --> 12:31.961
to refuse your request would seem
ungenerous.

12:34.159 --> 12:36.127
I will think about it.

12:38.556 --> 12:40.467
Well...

12:40.481 --> 12:42.358
Now I think I'll take my leave.

12:43.871 --> 12:47.796
I suspect ordinary conversation
would be difficult after that.

12:57.918 --> 13:00.579
What do you mean, that man Bricker
is coming back? Why?

13:00.609 --> 13:03.842
'That man Bricker'? What has he done
to deserve such a welcome?

13:03.940 --> 13:05.920
Hasn't he seen what he came to see?

13:05.944 --> 13:10.381
He wants to investigate a possible
link between our picture and a later
work by Della Francesca.

13:10.386 --> 13:12.127
Shrimpie is coming this week.

13:12.160 --> 13:16.381
Well, then, he and Mr Bricker will
get to know each other, won't they?

13:17.346 --> 13:19.656
Edith, darling, why so glum?

13:19.701 --> 13:21.726
I'm not glum, am I?

13:21.749 --> 13:23.797
How's your prodigy child?

13:24.762 --> 13:26.867
I haven't seen her for a while.

13:26.881 --> 13:30.135
I was getting rather under their feet,
so I thought I'd give them a rest.

13:30.173 --> 13:32.540
I knew that would happen.

13:32.551 --> 13:34.849
Why don't you leave it for a few
months?

13:34.870 --> 13:36.588
A few months?
I should.

13:36.601 --> 13:39.329
Then they'll be pleased to see you
when you do go back.

13:39.330 --> 13:41.206
Any thoughts on Pip's Corner?

13:41.207 --> 13:43.347
I'd love to understand the merits of
the argument.

13:43.362 --> 13:45.103
You want us to do it, don't you?

13:45.121 --> 13:48.068
Well, it's capital with no outlay.
We have to consider it.

13:48.069 --> 13:50.693
Consider it, yes. But it's complex.

13:50.694 --> 13:54.517
Do we really want to start breaking bits
off the estate and selling them piecemeal?

13:54.525 --> 13:57.131
You wanted to sell land when Matthew
died.

13:57.143 --> 14:00.528
And I was wrong. I didn't see how many
owners would chip away at their land

14:00.529 --> 14:02.479
until there was nothing viable left.

14:02.486 --> 14:04.341
Anyway, we can talk about it
tomorrow.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.823
Not me.
I'm going up to London first thing.

14:06.850 --> 14:09.148
Aunt Rosamund's taking me to a dress
show.

14:09.174 --> 14:12.064
It's good to know you've got your
priorities straight.

14:21.266 --> 14:23.098
Hello? Who's in there?

14:24.986 --> 14:27.489
Please, let me know who's in there.

14:27.498 --> 14:29.444
Go away.

14:29.454 --> 14:31.400
Mr Barrow?

14:31.414 --> 14:34.008
Would you like me to fetch a man to
help you?

14:36.784 --> 14:38.695
Mr Barrow...

14:39.151 --> 14:41.449
What man?

14:41.454 --> 14:44.162
There isn't a man in
this house who'd help me.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.562
What's the matter with you?

14:49.076 --> 14:50.953
Just mind your own business!

14:58.171 --> 15:00.549
Now, you're sure there's no big
evening event?

15:00.577 --> 15:02.955
No, and we're only there one night.

15:02.971 --> 15:05.815
When are you seeing His Lordship?
Friday morning.

15:05.831 --> 15:07.640
Before we catch the train home.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.846
It's right to do it face to face.

15:10.856 --> 15:12.802
But of course I'm dreading it.

15:23.615 --> 15:26.971
Daddy!
Hello, Sybbie, my love. Kiss.

15:29.527 --> 15:31.791
Thank you, Nanny. Morning, George.

15:31.809 --> 15:33.231
Morning, Donk.

15:33.245 --> 15:35.168
Morning, Sybbie. Morning, George.

15:36.159 --> 15:39.436
Do we think Lady Mary made the
train? She was cutting it fine.

15:39.450 --> 15:41.963
Mr Stark saw them both on board.

15:41.964 --> 15:43.932
Carson, may I ask you something?

15:45.002 --> 15:47.073
Is Mrs Patmore quite happy?

15:47.092 --> 15:51.279
I'm afraid there is a particular
matter that has upset her, m'lord.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.114
May I know what it is?

15:53.828 --> 15:56.240
But why make him wait?

15:56.280 --> 15:58.430
You mean I must refuse him now?

15:58.448 --> 16:02.169
Well, you said yourself the whole
idea was ridiculous.

16:02.183 --> 16:07.280
Yes, but I can only tell you, when it
came to it, he was not... ridiculous.

16:08.155 --> 16:10.248
You surprise me.

16:10.249 --> 16:13.492
One kind word and your judgment
takes flight.

16:13.531 --> 16:17.115
Surely Prince Kuragin has reminded
you what one kind word can do.

16:19.528 --> 16:21.485
He's asked me to think about it.

16:22.819 --> 16:24.765
And I will think about it.

16:28.175 --> 16:31.873
It was Michael's office on the telephone
- there's been a development.

16:33.255 --> 16:36.134
Apparently, there's a trial going on
in Munich.

16:36.868 --> 16:39.963
Of the leader of a group of thugs
there.

16:39.986 --> 16:43.900
I've read about this. They wear brown
shirts and go around bullying people.

16:43.901 --> 16:45.766
The leader tried to start a
revolution.

16:45.767 --> 16:47.923
That's it. It was absurd.

16:47.924 --> 16:51.838
Maybe. But I'm afraid we're going to
see a lot more of this sort of thing.

16:51.847 --> 16:55.021
We pushed Germany too hard with our
demands after the war.

16:55.047 --> 16:59.473
It seems it was this gang that got
into a fight with Michael.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.982
I can easily believe it. They're a
horrid bunch, from the sound of it.

17:03.006 --> 17:06.135
Yes, but we might be dose to
finding out what happened to him.

17:06.933 --> 17:08.878
That's why his office telephoned?

17:14.219 --> 17:17.165
It will be very hard for you, my
darling,

17:17.181 --> 17:21.880
but I promise it's better to know the
truth

17:21.886 --> 17:24.820
than to live in a cloud of mystery
and despair.

17:24.830 --> 17:29.507
But as long as I don't know for sure,
then, in a way, I'm keeping him alive.

17:30.819 --> 17:32.685
I hate to let go of that.

17:35.204 --> 17:37.600
Can you keep this to yourself, Papa?

17:37.601 --> 17:39.460
Until we're told for certain.

17:40.669 --> 17:44.367
I don't want to put up with Mary's
pity any longer than I have to.

17:44.375 --> 17:48.175
She will pity you, and God knows, so
do I.

17:53.638 --> 17:55.481
I'm fearfully late.

17:56.715 --> 17:58.786
Where are my gloves?
Don't worry.

17:58.802 --> 18:01.055
It will all be unpacked before you
get back.

18:01.062 --> 18:03.360
You're a dream. I must run.

18:03.902 --> 18:07.634
Oh, wait a minute.
Could you post this?

18:07.654 --> 18:11.024
Or give it to Mead if he hasn't
emptied the box in the hall.

18:11.025 --> 18:15.169
I never said where to meet me,
and Kensington Gardens
would be nice and neutral.

18:15.170 --> 18:17.240
I thought about dining with him
tonight,

18:17.242 --> 18:19.848
but midday seemed more appropriate
for bad news.

18:19.856 --> 18:21.699
Very good, m'lady.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.442
And how is Edith getting on?

18:43.454 --> 18:47.061
Actually, she's rather gloomy at the
moment. Do we know why?

18:47.065 --> 18:50.205
She's taken an interest in a child
of one of the tenants,

18:50.212 --> 18:52.408
and now the parents are sick of her.

18:52.411 --> 18:55.010
And why this child in particular?

18:55.011 --> 18:57.184
I don't know.
She took a fancy to it.

18:57.196 --> 18:59.585
Now she seems to have overplayed her
hand.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.580
Golly. That'd be useful.

19:02.581 --> 19:05.528
So, tell me more about this farmer
and his little girl.

19:05.543 --> 19:08.149
How did you know it was a girl?
Well, you must have said.

19:08.644 --> 19:10.954
He looks after the pigs.

19:10.968 --> 19:12.811
Oh, yummy.

19:15.051 --> 19:17.518
Good heavens. There's Charles Blake.

19:17.519 --> 19:19.351
What's he doing here?

19:56.182 --> 19:59.664
Excuse me. Is this right for Lord
Gillingham?

19:59.678 --> 20:01.957
That doorway. First floor.

20:01.958 --> 20:03.926
Thank you.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.082
Hello.

20:28.655 --> 20:31.147
Nice to see you.
Are you shopping for your trousseau?

20:31.148 --> 20:32.591
Ha-ha.

20:32.627 --> 20:35.722
Oh, I think you know Lady Mary
Crawley. Miss Lane Fox.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.835
Oops.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.998
I've suddenly remembered the
significance.

20:40.003 --> 20:41.769
Try not to be an ass, Charles.

20:41.770 --> 20:43.727
Well, we don't know each other,
exactly.

20:43.737 --> 20:46.331
But we certainly know OF each other.
Don't we?

20:46.847 --> 20:49.828
It's not often you meet the woman
you were jilted for. Well, I -

20:49.841 --> 20:53.118
Don't worry. I wouldn't want a man
who preferred someone else.

20:53.119 --> 20:56.024
You're quite over him, then?
Absolutely.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.236
Now I must go.
I'm meeting Ralph Kerr later.

20:58.244 --> 21:00.292
He's very tetchy if he's kept
waiting.

21:03.272 --> 21:05.548
I thought you knew each other.
No.

21:05.561 --> 21:08.303
And I must say, she wasn't at all
what I imagined.

21:08.304 --> 21:09.917
What was that?

21:09.928 --> 21:13.219
I don't know.
Someone meeker and more virtuous.

21:13.220 --> 21:16.042
I don't think Mabel's very meek.
No. Obviously not.

21:17.338 --> 21:20.421
How long are you in London?
I go home tomorrow.

21:20.451 --> 21:23.250
I'll see Tony in the morning and
then catch the train.

21:23.310 --> 21:25.210
Why? What are you doing tonight?
Nothing.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.937
Then why not have dinner with me?
Don't you have plans?

21:27.949 --> 21:30.763
None that I want to honour.
I'll come for you at eight.

21:30.764 --> 21:33.803
Nowhere too swanky.
I haven't brought the right clothes.

22:05.646 --> 22:09.332
I'll do them! Mrs Patmore, His
Lordship is asking for you.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.077
Come up to the library, please.

22:11.083 --> 22:14.212
Oh, my heaven! What, now? Oh, Lord!

22:14.239 --> 22:16.537
You look fine. Give me your apron.

22:16.542 --> 22:20.684
Ah, Mr Molesley. Just the man. Can you
cast your eye over the dining table?

22:20.687 --> 22:23.748
I won't have time before dinner, and
you're the First Footman.

22:23.758 --> 22:25.715
I was just going to -
While you're up there,

22:25.734 --> 22:28.452
check the bedrooms for Lord
Flintshire and Mr Bricker.

22:28.453 --> 22:31.943
I haven't got a moment and, as Mr
Carson says, you are the First Footman.

22:31.944 --> 22:33.900
Right. I'm ready.

22:36.980 --> 22:41.427
Go on, then, Mr Molesley.
It doesn't seem quite fair.

22:41.428 --> 22:44.159
You wanted to be First Footman.
What did you think?

22:44.170 --> 22:46.218
That you'd spend all day with your
feet up?

22:53.788 --> 22:56.530
I thought I'd pop in and see how
Marigold's getting on.

22:57.473 --> 23:00.329
I'm afraid I'm just taking her up
for a rest, m'lady.

23:01.175 --> 23:03.826
They've been playing outside and
she's tired.

23:03.844 --> 23:06.768
Does she have to go up right away?
I think so, yes, m'lady.

23:15.517 --> 23:17.326
M'lady?

23:21.757 --> 23:26.411
The... the trouble is, Margie thinks
you're unsettling the child.

23:33.646 --> 23:37.105
There are laws that govern the whole
business of war memorials.

23:37.121 --> 23:39.535
So Mr Carson's told me, m'lord.

23:39.536 --> 23:42.471
I appreciate how distressing this is
for you and your family.

23:42.484 --> 23:44.339
Do you, m'lord?

23:44.348 --> 23:46.737
Because I'm not sure Mr Carson does.

23:46.751 --> 23:49.675
Carson is as sorry about it as I am.
Aren't you, Carson?

23:50.215 --> 23:53.936
I'm sorry that Mrs Patmore should be
distressed, m'lord.

23:53.946 --> 23:57.644
But you're not sorry Archie's name's
to be left off the memorial.

23:57.659 --> 24:01.459
He volunteered.
He didn't wait to be called up.

24:01.473 --> 24:06.468
He went to the Front to fight, and
as for his so-called cowardice...

24:07.726 --> 24:10.991
that were like a wound in battle, a
wound to his brain,

24:10.992 --> 24:13.912
so he didn't know what he was doing.

24:13.936 --> 24:15.882
He were a good and decent lad.

24:15.898 --> 24:19.370
Of course he was. But doesn't that
make him a casualty of war, m'lord?

24:19.371 --> 24:21.362
Same as our William or any of them.

24:22.324 --> 24:26.261
He could have stayed here, safe and
well, until they came for him.

24:26.304 --> 24:30.070
But instead, he chose to
fight for his country.

24:30.118 --> 24:33.907
It may surprise you to learn, Mrs
Patmore, but I agree with you,

24:33.914 --> 24:36.110
even though I can do nothing about
it.

24:36.111 --> 24:38.373
It's not helpful, but I do.

24:38.389 --> 24:40.266
No, it is helpful.

24:40.297 --> 24:44.279
It helps to think that decent folk
can see our Archie was a victim.

24:44.811 --> 24:46.905
Even if Mr Carson can't.

24:49.754 --> 24:51.609
Thank you, Carson.

24:53.685 --> 24:56.711
When does Shrimpie get here?
And your ghastly art dealer.

24:57.689 --> 25:01.523
They're on the same train and
the car's meeting them, so they'll
have time to change.

25:01.530 --> 25:03.612
And he isn't a dealer. He's a
historian.

25:03.624 --> 25:05.900
Is he, indeed? Lawks a-mercy.

25:06.984 --> 25:09.612
I wish I knew why he was coming.

25:09.620 --> 25:12.009
He wants to discuss the painting.
With you?

25:12.016 --> 25:13.962
Yes. Is that so shocking?

25:15.057 --> 25:17.025
I'd better get on.

25:22.495 --> 25:24.928
Oh, Mr Molesley. I've not been told

25:24.929 --> 25:28.217
whether Lord Flintshire and Mr
Bricker will be bringing valets.

25:28.222 --> 25:30.852
Could you see they're properly
attended?

25:30.853 --> 25:32.981
Well, I've got a lot on my plate, Mr
Carson.

25:32.984 --> 25:35.396
I am sorry, Mr Molesley,
but you are -

25:35.408 --> 25:37.467
Yes, I know. I know. I'm the First
Footman.

25:41.626 --> 25:43.572
50, you're happy?

25:44.427 --> 25:48.614
Well, I'm not delirious, but who is?
I have a pretty good life.

25:48.633 --> 25:50.453
Well, I'm glad.

25:52.780 --> 25:56.023
I was never the type to die of a
broken heart, you know.

25:56.052 --> 25:58.426
I'm sorry if that offends you.

25:58.427 --> 26:02.148
On the contrary. I only hope Tony
feels the same.

26:04.033 --> 26:06.274
Goodness. I wasn't expecting that.

26:11.835 --> 26:14.020
I wish I could work you out.

26:14.048 --> 26:15.994
I wish I could work me out.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.029
When will you tell him?
Tomorrow.

26:21.886 --> 26:23.763
I'm meeting him at noon.

26:23.781 --> 26:26.849
By the Peter Pan statue in
Kensington Gardens.

26:26.850 --> 26:29.017
Won't that make him dream of happy
families?

26:29.037 --> 26:30.869
Well, it's too late to change it
now.

26:31.497 --> 26:33.238
What's he done wrong?

26:33.257 --> 26:35.214
Nothing.

26:35.220 --> 26:38.110
I'm very fond of him.
I'll always be fond of him.

26:40.157 --> 26:44.185
I want him to be the godfather of my
children. Just not their father.

26:46.183 --> 26:48.447
How will he take it?
Not as well as you.

26:52.739 --> 26:56.744
Well, you've got a way to soften the
blow. If you want to.

26:56.752 --> 26:58.800
I don't see how.
Don't you?

27:02.554 --> 27:06.468
You seem a little subdued tonight.
Do I, Granny?

27:06.471 --> 27:08.963
How strange. I wonder why.

27:08.976 --> 27:13.820
I know it sounds hard, but you must
learn to leave things behind.

27:13.821 --> 27:16.852
I suppose you mean I'm to leave
Michael behind now,

27:16.853 --> 27:20.018
as you've already made it quite
clear I'm to leave the baby behind.

27:20.019 --> 27:23.940
I would never suggest anything that
is not in your interest.

27:23.941 --> 27:26.854
In my interest? Or the family's?

27:26.901 --> 27:29.313
To me, they are the same.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.134
And that is where we differ.

27:34.536 --> 27:36.743
I've been thinking about your
missing person.

27:36.744 --> 27:39.341
Oh, I don't want to be a nuisance,

27:39.372 --> 27:44.061
but aren't there departments devoted
to finding people who are lost?

27:44.062 --> 27:47.326
Alas, not at my command.
And the Russians who were driven out

27:47.335 --> 27:49.397
have spread to the four corners of
the earth.

27:49.398 --> 27:51.572
Who is this woman?
An old friend of yours?

27:52.397 --> 27:55.719
No, she's the wife of an old friend.

27:55.732 --> 27:58.804
Oh, just see what you can do,
Shrimpie.

27:58.805 --> 28:03.038
Aunt Violet - if I can still call
you Aunt Violet -

28:03.047 --> 28:05.326
I ought to warn you about something.

28:05.327 --> 28:08.161
I can guess what it is.
You won't approve.

28:08.175 --> 28:09.619
No. I don't.

28:09.620 --> 28:13.716
You may even feel the need to take
sides. Susan is your niece.

28:13.726 --> 28:18.232
Well, I think you're making
a serious mistake, but you may
rest easy on that score.

28:18.239 --> 28:20.913
I never take sides in a broken
marriage.

28:20.940 --> 28:22.931
Why is that?

28:22.951 --> 28:26.535
Because, however much the couple may
strive to be honest,

28:26.549 --> 28:30.201
no-one is ever in possession of the
facts.

28:30.217 --> 28:32.390
Are you in a hurry to leave
tomorrow?

28:32.406 --> 28:35.432
Not at all. In fact, at the risk of
being a burden,

28:35.449 --> 28:37.429
I thought I might stay another
night.

28:37.447 --> 28:40.496
When are you off tomorrow?
He's staying for a couple of days.

28:40.504 --> 28:44.179
Is he? Well, I hope we've got enough
here to amuse you.

28:47.713 --> 28:50.444
Come into the library.
Excuse me.

28:51.173 --> 28:54.143
Why not invite Miss Bunting to
dinner tomorrow night?

28:54.159 --> 28:57.845
Mary will be back - we'll be quite a
party. Edith, persuade him.

28:57.857 --> 29:00.155
I don't think Papa would think it a
very good idea.

29:00.165 --> 29:03.647
What's this? I wanted Torn to invite
Miss Bunting to dinner tomorrow,

29:03.660 --> 29:05.833
but Edith says Robert won't allow
it.

29:05.865 --> 29:08.971
Nonsense. Of course you must bring
her, if you like. I insist.

29:12.164 --> 29:14.667
So, you've enjoyed Bombay for the
most part? Oh, yes.

29:14.670 --> 29:18.516
It's a wonderful city, the gateway
to the glories of the East.

29:18.538 --> 29:20.461
I felt very privileged.

29:22.424 --> 29:25.359
I gather things have not improved
with Susan.

29:25.373 --> 29:27.010
No.

29:27.011 --> 29:30.254
The times I've blessed you and Cora
for keeping Rose out of it.

29:30.597 --> 29:33.134
What happens now?

29:33.146 --> 29:35.513
Divorce, I'm afraid.
I can't see any other way.

29:35.531 --> 29:38.375
But my dear chap, is it worth it?

29:39.127 --> 29:41.073
Why can't you just live apart?

29:41.731 --> 29:45.543
If you'd ever been as unhappy as I
am, you'd know why not.

29:51.335 --> 29:53.986
Has Molesley gone to bed?

29:54.001 --> 29:56.800
Yes. Why?

29:56.814 --> 30:00.432
Mrs Patmore needs two more chafing
dishes first thing tomorrow.

30:00.464 --> 30:03.024
You can tell him in the morning.

30:03.037 --> 30:05.438
You're not so pally now, are you?

30:05.453 --> 30:07.399
Why are you still up?

30:08.727 --> 30:10.673
I just want to get this finished.

30:12.909 --> 30:15.617
Your father was never ill, was he?

30:15.655 --> 30:17.577
I'm sorry?

30:17.578 --> 30:20.843
Are you the one who's ill? Is that
it? Is that why you went away?

30:23.266 --> 30:26.190
What's it to do with you?
I'm right, aren't I?

30:26.200 --> 30:28.396
You're ill, and you went away to be
treated,

30:28.404 --> 30:31.544
and now you're trying to carry on
with the treatment yourself.

30:31.574 --> 30:34.589
Well, it has nothing to do with you,
so just leave me alone.

30:37.014 --> 30:40.507
Robert asked why we couldn't stay
together, for the look of the thing.

30:40.511 --> 30:42.457
I hope you see that we can't.

30:43.224 --> 30:45.431
But Daddy, where are you going to
live?

30:45.449 --> 30:47.599
Your mother will keep Upper Brook
Street.

30:47.611 --> 30:50.637
I'm not sure where I'm going to go
yet, but I'll find something.

30:50.664 --> 30:53.304
Oh, can I live with you?

30:53.316 --> 30:56.581
To be honest, I think you should
stay here for a while.

30:56.598 --> 30:59.204
The next part could be quite
unpleasant.

30:59.205 --> 31:01.443
I'm learning from it, though.

31:01.444 --> 31:05.085
I don't care how eligible some chap may be
- I'm not going to be bullied.

31:06.035 --> 31:08.117
Fighting talk.
I mean it.

31:09.693 --> 31:13.357
You all think that now I'm officially
'out', it's time to find my man.

31:13.376 --> 31:17.188
But I'm only going to marry if I'm
totally, absolutely in love.

31:18.939 --> 31:20.998
Of course.

31:21.550 --> 31:24.053
When I find him, will you promise to
be on my side?

31:25.148 --> 31:29.415
Promise you won't try to force me into a
'suitable' marriage, like you were forced.

31:29.423 --> 31:32.700
In other words, you're asking for a
blank cheque.

31:32.701 --> 31:34.361
Yes.

31:34.362 --> 31:36.626
That's just what I want.

31:36.640 --> 31:39.034
Oh, my dearest one.

31:39.035 --> 31:43.051
On the subject of marriage, I have
no right to give advice,

31:43.070 --> 31:45.016
let alone orders.

31:49.147 --> 31:52.196
'You must make haste to reach
Dieppe,

31:52.216 --> 31:55.711
where you are to seek out a Mr
Avebury.

31:55.727 --> 31:59.550
He will arrange for you to be taken
aboard a packet and conveyed to safety,

31:59.553 --> 32:03.046
but do not delay, if you hold your
mother dear.'

32:03.066 --> 32:05.228
Poor woman. I know how she felt.

32:06.533 --> 32:10.814
'As for your collection, Mr Avebury
will do what he can,

32:10.815 --> 32:15.184
but I'd rather every canvas or
carving were tossed in the sea

32:15.218 --> 32:19.337
to your being one extra hour in that
unhappy country.'

32:21.075 --> 32:23.681
I'm glad he didn't take her advice.

32:23.700 --> 32:26.624
He did not.
He brought crates and crates over,

32:26.634 --> 32:29.467
then went back after the Reign of
Terror to buy more.

32:30.242 --> 32:33.086
And you have preserved them safely
in this beautiful place.

32:33.101 --> 32:35.263
I'm glad you think it's beautiful.

32:35.279 --> 32:39.193
I think everything about Downton is
beautiful, including its mistress.

32:39.206 --> 32:42.358
You mustn't say such things.
I have to, or I'll burst.

32:42.374 --> 32:44.888
What's burst?

32:44.892 --> 32:47.486
I was just saying that...

32:47.487 --> 32:52.015
being allowed to touch a painting
like this will make me burst.

32:52.027 --> 32:55.696
It's wonderful to show it to someone
so appreciative. Yes.

32:55.697 --> 32:58.511
No-one could say you're not
appreciative, Mr Bricker.

33:06.967 --> 33:10.437
I can't be hearing this correctly.
I'm afraid you are.

33:10.491 --> 33:13.609
So, you sleep with a man because he
wants to marry you,

33:13.617 --> 33:15.870
but now you change your mind.
It's insane!

33:15.879 --> 33:17.643
I'm sorry if you think so.

33:17.677 --> 33:20.248
Well, I won't let it happen.
I love you and you love me.

33:20.259 --> 33:21.909
At least, you told me so in
Liverpool.

33:21.927 --> 33:24.104
I know, and I thought I meant it.

33:24.105 --> 33:26.502
Well, what's changed?
I can't explain, exactly.

33:26.503 --> 33:28.544
But something has. That's all.

33:28.550 --> 33:31.360
Am I a bad lover'? Is that what
you're trying to tell. me?

33:31.398 --> 33:33.560
Don't be silly. It's not that at
all.

33:33.573 --> 33:37.066
It's just, I feel I've sort of...
woken up out of a dream.

33:37.084 --> 33:40.375
How flattering! We go to
bed together and you wake up!

33:40.376 --> 33:43.528
I'm just not sure we have enough in
common, to make a go of things.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.364
Well, I refuse to accept it.

33:45.378 --> 33:48.188
I refuse to believe that a woman
like you, a lady,

33:48.233 --> 33:51.715
could give herself to a man without first
being certain that he was the one.

33:51.724 --> 33:55.103
So, what are you saying? This is
something we've got to get through.

33:55.107 --> 33:58.065
And we will. We will get through
this together.

34:09.708 --> 34:12.210
Mr Molesley. You wanted to see me?

34:12.996 --> 34:15.748
Only to say

34:15.775 --> 34:19.335
that I'm not sure I should be called the
First Footman, after all, Mr Carson.

34:19.346 --> 34:21.292
Are you not?
No.

34:21.308 --> 34:23.822
Well, it's not like the old days, is
it?

34:23.847 --> 34:29.263
I mean, the duties of the First Footman
are shared between a lot
of people now, aren't they?

34:29.295 --> 34:31.993
Are they?
Well, they should be...

34:31.996 --> 34:35.695
because I've got the duties of the
Second and Third Footman to deal with.

34:35.702 --> 34:40.400
So, you don't feel you need the precedence
that the title 'First Footman' confers?

34:42.268 --> 34:45.193
Er... well, not really, no.

34:46.063 --> 34:47.918
Very well.

34:48.784 --> 34:50.650
I'll see what I can do.

34:59.956 --> 35:03.005
I wasn't sure you'd want to come.
Nonsense.

35:03.036 --> 35:05.182
I'm flattered to be asked.

35:05.183 --> 35:08.483
I didn't think I would be again.
Not after last time.

35:08.491 --> 35:10.414
Try to be nice to him tonight.

35:11.966 --> 35:15.118
I will be, if he's nice to me.

35:15.142 --> 35:19.409
I know you don't like him, or any of
them, much,

35:19.430 --> 35:22.422
but you forget one thing -
they are good to me, in their way.

35:23.662 --> 35:25.585
And I love them.

35:28.665 --> 35:31.441
I don't want you to hate them.

35:31.458 --> 35:34.120
Just to realise that you're more
than a retainer.

35:34.135 --> 35:37.821
I can't bear for you to waste your life
propping up a system that's dying.

35:39.607 --> 35:41.427
Well, it won't die before dinner.

35:44.716 --> 35:47.777
Someone's dropped this in the
passage. The London Magazine.

35:47.791 --> 35:51.614
Does it belong to any of you?
Mr Barrow was reading it earlier.

35:51.623 --> 35:55.093
Would you give it to him when he
comes down, Miss Baxter? Of course.

36:07.207 --> 36:10.928
Where did you get this?
Have you been in my room?

36:10.949 --> 36:13.998
Of course not. You dropped it in the
passage. Mrs Hughes found it.

36:13.999 --> 36:17.491
Mrs Hughes found it, but Miss Baxter
read it.

36:17.492 --> 36:20.746
I'm sorry for what you've gone
through, if what I think is correct.

36:20.758 --> 36:22.726
Don't you pity me.

36:23.342 --> 36:25.219
Don't you dare pity me.

36:29.185 --> 36:32.156
Did you bring the photographs of
Della Francesca's Nativity?

36:32.157 --> 36:36.265
I certainly did. We can compare them
to the painting tomorrow.

36:36.274 --> 36:39.630
It would be so lovely if it does
turn out to be a study for it.

36:39.641 --> 36:42.599
Yes. It would be absolutely lovely.

36:42.612 --> 36:46.628
Mr Bricker, one more word and I will
ask you to sit somewhere else!

36:46.647 --> 36:50.038
He flatters her. He keeps asking her
opinion on everything.

36:50.046 --> 36:51.980
Well, don't you ever ask her
opinion?

36:51.993 --> 36:53.995
Of course I do. Sometimes.

36:54.820 --> 36:57.450
Did you have a good time in London?
Quite good.

36:57.451 --> 36:59.780
I set myself rather a difficult
task,

36:59.781 --> 37:02.450
and it's always a relief when it's
done, isn't it?

37:05.016 --> 37:08.600
- How are your lessons going?
- What's this?

37:08.601 --> 37:11.775
Miss Bunting is giving instruction
to Mrs Patmore's undercook.

37:11.776 --> 37:13.608
Oh, yes. I heard about that.

37:13.623 --> 37:16.490
You sound as if you don't approve.
I approve.

37:16.491 --> 37:19.831
As long as you're not making... her
unsettled.

37:20.285 --> 37:22.891
You don't know her name, do you?

37:22.928 --> 37:25.630
Sarah, please.
Of course he does.

37:25.631 --> 37:27.565
Daisy.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.817
Well, he knows it now.
I knew it before.

37:32.861 --> 37:36.320
And it sounds as if you're upsetting
her and Mrs Patmore.

37:36.326 --> 37:38.602
I think you should drop this.

37:39.269 --> 37:42.904
Why don't you send for her'?
Bring Daisy in and ask her yourself.

37:42.905 --> 37:46.620
I'm sure she's too busy. Not too busy
to answer a summons from you.

37:46.621 --> 37:48.430
We don't want to embarrass her.

37:49.388 --> 37:51.083
Carson?

37:51.091 --> 37:55.881
This is the busiest time of their day,
m'lord. Maybe it would be better -

37:55.882 --> 37:58.061
No. Fetch her.

37:58.065 --> 38:00.022
And ask Mrs Patmore to come up, as
well.

38:01.683 --> 38:03.503
Very good, m'lord.

38:07.887 --> 38:09.844
Your father may regret this.

38:16.297 --> 38:18.728
I wondered if you wanted a hand.
Almost done.

38:18.729 --> 38:20.976
You could put the cases away, if
you've a mind.

38:23.723 --> 38:26.658
Did you enjoy yourself?
We weren't there long enough.

38:27.752 --> 38:31.063
I went to deliver a letter to Lord
Gillingham in Albany.

38:31.064 --> 38:32.778
Oh, yes?

38:32.779 --> 38:35.089
Then I walked into Piccadilly.

38:35.116 --> 38:37.016
His Lordship's lucky to live there.

38:37.945 --> 38:40.539
Do you recall Mr Green saying that?
Saying what?

38:41.534 --> 38:44.572
Jimmy heard where he lived and
called him a lucky tyke.

38:44.588 --> 38:47.068
He wasn't very lucky in the end,
though, was he?

38:47.935 --> 38:49.812
No. He wasn't lucky in the end.

38:50.247 --> 38:53.751
Right. I'll take these up to the
luggage room.

39:07.729 --> 39:11.359
Is something wrong with the dinner,
m'lord? Not at all.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.506
We apologise, Mrs Patmore,

39:13.522 --> 39:19.188
for interfering with your duties in
this strange and inconsiderate way.

39:19.195 --> 39:21.273
Mrs Patmore, Carson tells me

39:21.274 --> 39:25.097
you feel Daisy's lessons have
disturbed the peace of the kitchen.

39:25.107 --> 39:28.029
Did you say that?
I don't know what I said.

39:28.030 --> 39:30.233
I was upset
about that other business.

39:30.266 --> 39:32.753
I wondered if it were true. Daisy?

39:32.754 --> 39:35.030
Well, I'm sorry if I've made trouble
downstairs.

39:35.044 --> 39:36.910
Well, you haven't. Not really.

39:36.911 --> 39:39.109
But I must say this, m'lord.

39:39.110 --> 39:43.308
Miss Bunting here has opened my eyes to
a world of knowledge I knew nothing of.

39:43.325 --> 39:45.510
Maybe I'll stay a cook all my life,

39:45.513 --> 39:50.326
but I have choices now, interests,
facts at my fingertips.

39:50.359 --> 39:53.966
And I'd never have had any of that
if she hadn't come here to teach me.

39:53.973 --> 39:55.759
Brava. Well said.

39:57.529 --> 40:00.373
Quite a testimonial.
May we go, m'lord?

40:00.420 --> 40:02.559
We've still got the pudding and the
savouries.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.515
Of course. Thank you.

40:07.470 --> 40:10.542
Obviously, the lessons have proved
successful.

40:10.543 --> 40:12.495
I'm pleased to hear it.

40:12.915 --> 40:14.679
Are you, Lord Grantham?

40:14.695 --> 40:17.517
Oh, for heaven's sake, let it go.
You've proved your point.

40:17.548 --> 40:20.256
Have I, though? All I've proved is
that Lord Grantham

40:20.267 --> 40:23.510
would like us serfs to stay in our
allotted place from cradle to grave.

40:23.522 --> 40:26.036
There is only one thing I
would like...

40:26.076 --> 40:28.310
and that I would like passionately.

40:28.311 --> 40:31.591
It is to see you leave this house
and never come back!

40:36.711 --> 40:38.611
Happy now?

40:41.758 --> 40:45.592
Edith, dear, are you still writing
that very interesting column?

40:45.593 --> 40:47.095
Yes, Granny.

40:47.105 --> 40:49.301
Oh, you must show me some of them.

40:49.317 --> 40:51.137
What is the latest one about?

40:52.477 --> 40:56.050
What are they all about?
The way the world is changing.

41:00.767 --> 41:03.145
What's happening? What's all the
commotion?

41:04.692 --> 41:06.660
He just left the room.

41:06.866 --> 41:08.607
Oh, I don't mean to interrupt.

41:08.609 --> 41:11.607
No, no. We were just discussing the
Battle of Little Bighorn.

41:11.608 --> 41:13.318
The Battle of Little Minx, more
like.

41:13.320 --> 41:16.585
To speak to His Lordship in that
manner! In his own house.

41:16.590 --> 41:19.548
It's true, then? I thought Mr Barrow
might be exaggerating.

41:19.558 --> 41:21.404
It seems he wasn't, for once.

41:21.405 --> 41:24.786
Mr Branson must be horrified to have
brought her here.

41:24.789 --> 41:26.564
I don't know.

41:26.579 --> 41:30.787
I like him, but sometimes I think
we've forgotten the Mr Branson
that was down here with us,

41:30.788 --> 41:33.845
spouting Keir Hardie between every
mouthful.

41:33.864 --> 41:36.777
They've made him one of them in a
way, but it's not who he really is.

41:36.781 --> 41:40.001
Then it makes me wonder whether
Downton is the place for him.

41:40.002 --> 41:43.131
A question I'm sure he's asked
himself many times.

41:44.177 --> 41:47.408
I can't stand that woman.
No great surprise there.

41:47.427 --> 41:49.691
I suppose you think I made a fool of
myself.

41:49.703 --> 41:52.968
What does it matter? I don't see
that you were much better.

41:52.977 --> 41:56.322
Flirting and twinkling with that
ghastly travelling salesman.

42:00.596 --> 42:03.736
Go to sleep, and when you wake up,

42:04.973 --> 42:07.590
make sure you get out of bed on the
right side.

42:23.401 --> 42:25.520
Good night, Tom.

42:25.521 --> 42:28.365
And cheer up.
You gave Granny a wonderful evening.

42:37.397 --> 42:39.343
Well, what a to-do!

42:39.349 --> 42:43.422
It seems to me your friend Miss
Bunting is out to make trouble.

42:43.435 --> 42:46.132
She's brought me to life, Mrs
Patmore.

42:46.141 --> 42:50.191
All the same, she wouldn't win a
popularity contest upstairs.

42:50.198 --> 42:52.565
Would you like to write a letter to
the War Office?

42:52.566 --> 42:55.210
Oh, don't be daft.
I mean it.

42:55.221 --> 42:58.907
If you think Archie's been badly
treated, you must protest.

42:58.918 --> 43:01.774
I wouldn't know how to write a
letter like that.

43:01.781 --> 43:04.600
I can write it for you.
It won't do any good.

43:04.601 --> 43:07.705
His Lordship says there are rules in
place. He wouldn't lie.

43:07.706 --> 43:11.450
No, but if you protest and then, over the
years, more and more others protest,

43:11.475 --> 43:13.660
then they might change their blessed
rules.

43:13.672 --> 43:16.039
This is your learning, isn't it?

43:16.079 --> 43:18.685
That's what you're trying
to show me - you're not afraid.

43:18.686 --> 43:20.625
No, I'm not.

43:21.218 --> 43:23.277
Well, go on, then.

43:23.296 --> 43:25.105
We'll do it tomorrow.

43:37.021 --> 43:40.730
How can we help you this time?
It's an odd business.

43:40.748 --> 43:43.809
Since all this started, they've kept
a plain-clothes man on watch

43:43.812 --> 43:45.871
at Lord Gillingham's set in Albany,

43:45.896 --> 43:50.265
and now I'm told that Mrs Bates was
seen there, loitering outside.

43:50.281 --> 43:52.636
Well, I know why that would be.

43:52.640 --> 43:56.371
Lady Mary must have wanted to see Lord
Gillingham while she was in London.

43:56.372 --> 43:59.192
No doubt, Anna was sent with a
message to arrange a meeting.

43:59.203 --> 44:02.696
I knew you'd have something sensible
to say. Sergeant?

44:02.707 --> 44:04.994
Well, it seems likely.

44:05.007 --> 44:08.363
But from there, Mrs Bates walked
into Piccadilly,

44:08.372 --> 44:11.086
to the spot where Mr Green died.

44:11.087 --> 44:13.966
There's no possibility she might
have a grudge against him,

44:13.967 --> 44:15.767
that Mr Bates might share?

44:15.793 --> 44:19.612
Not that I'm aware.
As I recall, she rather liked him.

44:19.613 --> 44:23.334
Mrs Hughes?
Yes, she liked him. So she said.

44:23.335 --> 44:27.033
They may want to question her, but before
they do, they want me to check one thing.

44:27.045 --> 44:30.743
She was definitely here on the day
of his death? Here at Downton?

44:33.039 --> 44:36.020
I believe so.
Surely, you can't think that Mrs -

44:36.045 --> 44:39.117
I'm not paid to think, Mrs Hughes.
Just to record the facts.

44:40.773 --> 44:44.641
Hong Kong? A lot of the Tsarist
sympathisers ended up there.

44:44.642 --> 44:48.681
How did they survive?
As servants and taxi drivers.

44:48.686 --> 44:52.998
Milliners and prostitutes. Anything
they could lay their hand to.

44:53.013 --> 44:57.874
I will not suggest to which of those
callings the Princess Kuragin
was most suited.

44:57.875 --> 45:00.880
If you dislike her so much, why are
you going to all this trouble?

45:00.891 --> 45:02.950
Because I owe it to her.
Why?

45:04.060 --> 45:06.336
By the way, Susan has written to
Annabel

45:06.353 --> 45:09.181
to say that she's furious that
you've all taken me in.

45:09.182 --> 45:13.556
Oh, dear Susan has been in a rage
since she was playing with her dolls.

45:13.603 --> 45:15.742
I am proof against her tantrums.

45:15.755 --> 45:18.508
I would rephrase that if you want to
stay neutral.

45:18.509 --> 45:20.977
I won't take sides - it's true.

45:21.938 --> 45:24.942
But I don't think I could ever be
described as 'neutral'.

45:29.165 --> 45:32.117
Have you apologized to Tom?

45:32.118 --> 45:36.043
I never knew anyone who could provoke me
into saying so many things I don't believe.

45:36.086 --> 45:38.786
But I am sorry, Tom.
Please forgive me.

45:38.787 --> 45:41.957
She knows how to goad you.
With the precision of a surgeon.

45:41.958 --> 45:44.703
Why do you go on with her?
Since Sybil. died,

45:44.712 --> 45:48.489
I've forgotten what it's like to be with
someone who feels about things as I do.

45:48.508 --> 45:51.250
That's why. Or that's been why.

45:51.257 --> 45:55.046
To me, it's as if you'd joined us
and now you're backing away.

46:00.185 --> 46:02.597
What are we doing here?

46:02.603 --> 46:06.198
I want to explain why I think we
should turn down Wavell's offer.

46:06.209 --> 46:09.930
I know. We are only the caretakers
of Downton.

46:09.957 --> 46:11.868
But Papa, some things have to
change.

46:11.879 --> 46:15.463
True. But we mustn't destroy what
we're trying to protect.

46:15.478 --> 46:19.638
Wavell would wreck this lovely place
for ever, with his ugly, cheap houses.

46:19.639 --> 46:22.477
But you can't block all development.
I won't.

46:22.512 --> 46:25.300
I intend to expand, but without
spoiling.

46:25.311 --> 46:27.598
I'm going to make a plan and find a
solid builder

46:27.608 --> 46:30.316
who can fit in to the village and not
ruin it.

46:30.322 --> 46:32.648
That may be hard to achieve.
It may be harder

46:32.649 --> 46:36.430
than cashing Wavell's cheque, but
does that mean we shouldn't we

46:36.457 --> 46:38.300
No.

46:38.610 --> 46:41.147
We will build.

46:41.166 --> 46:42.994
We'll even make money for the
estate.

46:42.995 --> 46:46.290
But we won't destroy what people
love about this place.

46:46.295 --> 46:48.127
Do you think that's wrong?

46:48.133 --> 46:50.431
No. It's not wrong.

46:50.435 --> 46:52.381
That's all I'm asking.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.946
Have any of you heard of someone
called Atticus Aldridge?

47:02.977 --> 47:06.254
I should think carefully before you
say one more word.

47:06.265 --> 47:09.784
I'm afraid you've read somewhere
that rudeness in old age is amusing.

47:09.785 --> 47:13.257
Margie feels you want the child to be
your plaything. How can she say that?

47:13.262 --> 47:16.618
And you liked Mr Green?
Yes, I did. Very much.

47:16.624 --> 47:20.248
You despise the family, but I think
you forget - my child is one of them.
