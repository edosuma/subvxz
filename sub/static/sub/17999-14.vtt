WEBVTT

00:02.196 --> 00:03.695
You ever wonder why
they are still using

00:03.697 --> 00:05.697
some teenage
heroes in comic books?

00:05.800 --> 00:07.100
I mean, seems like
most of the people

00:07.101 --> 00:08.901
buy comics when they are old.

00:08.902 --> 00:11.502
Yeah, this kind of an
outdated template now, right?

00:11.503 --> 00:15.125
I mean, back when they
introduced the teen superheroes

00:15.126 --> 00:16.893
every company did that model.

00:16.894 --> 00:20.416
Young teen gets powers,
becomes a superhero.

00:20.417 --> 00:23.158
Reader can identify with
so much, so,

00:23.159 --> 00:26.802
they follow that teen
superhero for decades.

00:26.803 --> 00:29.303
Bringing the superhero
for our generation.

00:29.304 --> 00:30.604
The forty something.

00:30.605 --> 00:32.396
You have a bunch of
superheroes from your generation.

00:32.397 --> 00:33.697
And then you went gone
old donel.

01:12.686 --> 01:15.604
Hello, and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,

01:15.655 --> 01:18.407
The only show that knows
for a fact that Han shot first,

01:18.442 --> 01:20.292
And I'm your host Kevin Smith.

01:20.327 --> 01:21.961
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:21.995 --> 01:23.496
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:23.530 --> 01:24.930
What's the biggest item

01:24.948 --> 01:26.298
That's come through
the doors this week?

01:26.333 --> 01:28.734
- The biggest item?
- Yeah.

01:28.769 --> 01:31.737
Hands down... Han's down.

01:31.772 --> 01:35.241
[laughter]
Real-I'm intrigued.

01:37.411 --> 01:38.477
Hey, guys, how's it going?

01:38.512 --> 01:40.863
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Been a while.

01:40.897 --> 01:42.031
I have something
I want you guys to check out.

01:42.065 --> 01:44.417
Okay. Let me just move
some of this stuff here.

01:44.451 --> 01:47.720
Look at this real quick.

01:47.754 --> 01:49.388
See if you can figure out
what that's for.

01:49.423 --> 01:51.957
I got the rest out in the van
if somebody could come help me.

01:51.992 --> 01:53.292
Oh, my God.

01:53.326 --> 01:54.743
- Got it, ming?
- Got it.

01:54.778 --> 01:56.195
All right.

02:01.318 --> 02:03.068
- Excuse me, Mike.
- Wow.

02:03.103 --> 02:06.272
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't drop it, Ming.

02:06.306 --> 02:07.406
- Watch out.
- Got it?

02:07.441 --> 02:11.076
Come on, Ming.
What the hell?

02:11.111 --> 02:12.478
Holy smokes.

02:19.736 --> 02:20.886
The Millennium Falcon.

02:20.904 --> 02:22.021
Is this is the one
they used in the movies?

02:22.055 --> 02:23.305
Is Han Solo in here?

02:23.340 --> 02:25.424
Because yeah, I remember it,
but is this a toy?

02:25.458 --> 02:26.592
It was the actual
prop displays

02:26.626 --> 02:29.462
They hung in Toys"R"Us
back in '97

02:29.496 --> 02:31.530
When they re-released
the original trilogies.

02:31.565 --> 02:33.432
I saw this thing almost
every day of my life in '97

02:33.466 --> 02:36.318
Or when I would go to Toys"R"Us
on my Star Wars toy runs.

02:36.353 --> 02:39.471
Like, the magical door would
open, I would go and look up.

02:39.489 --> 02:41.273
This thing would be
hanging right above me.

02:41.308 --> 02:45.444
I mean, where do you place it
in the pantheon of starships?

02:45.479 --> 02:48.247
You have to put--
never mind starships.

02:48.281 --> 02:50.883
In the pantheon
of pop culture vehicles,

02:50.917 --> 02:53.953
I think it goes Bat Mobile,
Millennium Falcon.

02:53.987 --> 02:55.854
It's that way up
on the list.

02:55.872 --> 02:58.624
I mean, you could think about,
like, a Battlestar Galactica,

02:58.658 --> 03:00.659
The Galactica itself,
or of course--you know what?

03:00.694 --> 03:03.295
- To be fair, Star Trek--
- I was gonna say, man.

03:03.330 --> 03:04.313
[laughs]
- Yeah, you know what?

03:04.347 --> 03:05.314
Yeah, you know,
now I think about it.

03:05.348 --> 03:06.565
USS Enterprise is calling.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.650
I know there are
a lot of trekkies that are like,

03:07.684 --> 03:08.651
"You better pull that back,
fat boy!"

03:08.685 --> 03:10.102
[laughs]

03:10.136 --> 03:12.204
If I remember right, like,
when it hung from the ceiling,

03:12.239 --> 03:13.822
It lit up too, right?
Were their lights on it and--

03:13.857 --> 03:15.157
Right, like, in here,

03:15.192 --> 03:16.775
These will light up.
There's some on the bottom.

03:16.809 --> 03:18.077
I've never actually
had it in or lit up, but--

03:18.111 --> 03:19.945
- Wow, where'd you get it?

03:19.980 --> 03:21.614
Rosie O'Donnell
raffled 'em off for charity--

03:21.648 --> 03:23.315
For a kid's charity back then.

03:23.350 --> 03:25.000
- You won this?
- I won it. Yep.

03:25.035 --> 03:26.168
- Wow.
- This is--

03:26.203 --> 03:28.787
- It's pretty crappy.
- Pretty crappy?

03:28.821 --> 03:30.322
- [laughs]
- Pretty damn sweet, man.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.524
Pretty friggin' impressive.

03:31.558 --> 03:33.926
This is the sweetest ride
I've ever seen.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.694
So, you've had this
for how long?

03:35.729 --> 03:37.296
About 15 years.

03:37.330 --> 03:38.931
- Where have you kept it?
- In a box mostly.

03:38.965 --> 03:40.799
You're looking to sell it?

03:40.833 --> 03:42.434
- Yeah, it's been--
- How come?

03:42.469 --> 03:44.036
It's been in storage.

03:44.070 --> 03:45.221
Yeah, are you're paying
storage fees on it?

03:45.272 --> 03:46.772
No, that's--
it's in a garage, but--

03:46.806 --> 03:48.774
You should have
never said that.

03:48.792 --> 03:50.743
You should have been like,
"it hung from the ceiling."

03:50.777 --> 03:51.911
I wake up with it
every morning.

03:51.945 --> 03:53.546
- My grandmother died under it.
- [laughs]

03:53.580 --> 03:56.448
We had her wake under it.
She loved it. It means so much.

03:56.466 --> 03:58.083
You can't be like,
"I don't know.

03:58.117 --> 04:00.686
I haven't seen it
in 15 years," so--

04:00.720 --> 04:02.504
How much?

04:02.556 --> 04:05.841
Uh, I was thinking 22.

04:05.892 --> 04:07.292
- Dollars? Awesome.
- I don't want it no more.

04:07.310 --> 04:08.894
- [laughs]
- No?

04:08.929 --> 04:10.279
There haven't been
many of 'em sold,

04:10.313 --> 04:12.831
And the ones that have,
it's few and far between and--

04:12.866 --> 04:14.133
What do they go for?

04:14.167 --> 04:16.000
Probably anywhere
from 1,200 to 3,000.

04:16.036 --> 04:18.536
- You want 2,200 though, huh?
- Right.

04:18.572 --> 04:20.339
Come on, man, what's the least
you'll take for this?

04:20.373 --> 04:23.342
Would you do 1,500?

04:23.360 --> 04:24.893
You know,
you've had it for 15 years

04:24.945 --> 04:25.978
And haven't
done anything with it.

04:26.012 --> 04:27.479
I'm sure it means
a lot to you.

04:27.513 --> 04:29.031
So, 1,300...
[laughter]

04:29.065 --> 04:33.719
Is the best
I could do today.

04:33.753 --> 04:37.089
1,300--it's a lot of money.

04:37.123 --> 04:38.457
- All right.
- 13?

04:38.491 --> 04:40.325
- Yep.
- 13? Awesome.

04:40.343 --> 04:42.394
Thank you.

04:42.429 --> 04:46.031
1,300.
There you go.

04:46.066 --> 04:47.466
- All right, thanks guys.
- Good.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.567
When's the last time
the Stash

04:48.602 --> 04:50.102
Bought something
for over $1,000?

04:50.136 --> 04:51.487
- It doesn't happen very often.
- No, when was the last time--

04:51.521 --> 04:52.804
I think it was--
I think it was Ming.

04:52.822 --> 04:55.274
[laughter]

04:55.308 --> 04:57.242
- You guys have a good one.
- All right, man, appreciate it.

04:57.277 --> 04:59.628
- See you later, man.
- Take care.

04:59.679 --> 05:02.881
Sometimes when I feel morale
is sagging at the Stash,

05:02.916 --> 05:04.700
I try to come up
with an innovative way

05:04.734 --> 05:06.619
To build some team chemistry.

05:06.653 --> 05:07.920
- Okay.
- Or he asks me to leave.

05:07.954 --> 05:09.021
[laughter]

05:09.055 --> 05:10.689
And this time,

05:10.707 --> 05:13.325
I think I came up
with the ultimate idea.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.360
I thought we would all

05:14.394 --> 05:18.564
Have a hand in creating
a comic book.

05:18.598 --> 05:20.366
You know, and I want
everybody involved.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.550
I want you guys to,
like, you know,

05:21.601 --> 05:23.569
Shoot me some ideas
for some villains.

05:23.603 --> 05:25.604
I want you to script it.

05:25.639 --> 05:28.007
I want you to create a villain,
the look, and his angle,

05:28.041 --> 05:30.809
Everything, and really
pitch it to a company.

05:30.844 --> 05:32.277
- See if they'll print it.
- Cool.

05:32.312 --> 05:33.512
All right, let's do this.

05:33.546 --> 05:34.813
Both: All right.
- It's gonna be awesome, man.

05:34.848 --> 05:37.716
You got it right.
"badass" is the word of the day.

05:37.734 --> 05:39.918
Step it up, badass.

05:41.454 --> 05:42.788
- Check that out.
- Oh, there it is.

05:42.822 --> 05:44.757
I loved this stupid toy
when I was a kid.

05:44.791 --> 05:46.425
I've been looking
for one of these for a while.

05:46.459 --> 05:48.260
Well, you found it.

05:52.776 --> 05:53.909
Excuse me, guys.

05:53.944 --> 05:55.278
- Oh, hey, man, how you doing?
- How you doing?

05:55.312 --> 05:56.562
My name's Phil.

05:56.596 --> 05:58.347
I called about the godzilla
shogun warrior figure.

05:58.381 --> 05:59.482
That's right.

05:59.516 --> 06:02.351
- Check that out.
- Oh, there it is.

06:08.659 --> 06:12.395
Look how clean
and sweet that is.

06:12.429 --> 06:15.231
- That's in really good shape.
- Does he have roller skates on?

06:15.265 --> 06:18.384
- [laughs] yeah.
- He sure does.

06:18.435 --> 06:19.402
- It was the '70s.
- Yeah.

06:19.436 --> 06:21.003
No robotics, no robotics.

06:21.037 --> 06:22.772
Yeah? Oh, was that the height
of the disco craze?

06:22.806 --> 06:23.906
Disco roller.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.374
This one even
has the lever intact.

06:25.409 --> 06:26.575
Yeah.
Fists still work.

06:26.609 --> 06:28.611
The flying fist.
Oh, it actually works.

06:28.645 --> 06:30.780
[laughs]
- yeah, oh, yeah.

06:30.814 --> 06:32.681
I've been looking
for one of these for a while.

06:32.699 --> 06:34.150
Well, you found it.

06:34.184 --> 06:35.818
I loved this stupid toy
when I was a kid.

06:35.852 --> 06:39.221
It's fun to reacquire
old loves.

06:39.239 --> 06:40.456
Yep. Yeah, it just
brings back memories.

06:40.490 --> 06:41.791
I'd also like
to share this with my kids.

06:41.825 --> 06:43.559
I got two young guys, and--

06:43.577 --> 06:44.927
- You're gonna let them
play with it, huh?

06:44.961 --> 06:46.329
Yeah, let 'em play with it
a little bit, sure.

06:46.363 --> 06:47.730
There's a lot of parents
that do that.

06:47.764 --> 06:50.383
They remember something so
lovingly and so nostalgically,

06:50.417 --> 06:51.867
They want to push it
on their kids who are like,

06:51.902 --> 06:53.469
"What are you talking about?"

06:53.503 --> 06:55.287
I watched Star Wars
with my kid,

06:55.322 --> 06:56.539
And I was beside myself.

06:56.573 --> 06:57.573
Like, "isn't this great?
This is amazing.

06:57.607 --> 06:59.041
Isn't this great?"

06:59.076 --> 07:01.711
And my kid, who was
about six at the time--

07:01.745 --> 07:05.147
Even I could tell a 6-year-old
was just being polite to me.

07:05.182 --> 07:06.315
[laughs]

07:06.349 --> 07:07.450
Like, "this is
an adventurous movie, father."

07:07.484 --> 07:09.752
Like, you know,
she was playing me a little bit.

07:09.786 --> 07:11.354
How much
are you looking here?

07:11.388 --> 07:14.090
We're looking to get--
for this piece in this condition

07:14.124 --> 07:15.858
With everything working,

07:15.892 --> 07:19.295
I'm looking to get 250.

07:19.329 --> 07:21.297
What about, uh...

07:21.331 --> 07:22.998
200?

07:23.033 --> 07:26.502
200?

07:26.536 --> 07:28.871
What do you think, ming?

07:28.905 --> 07:31.907
That's a big drop.
Um...

07:31.925 --> 07:33.209
230.

07:33.243 --> 07:34.393
I think that's fair.

07:34.428 --> 07:35.911
225.

07:35.946 --> 07:37.463
Will it make you happy?

07:37.514 --> 07:38.881
- It'll make me very happy.
- Let's shake on it.

07:38.915 --> 07:41.384
And my kids.

07:44.254 --> 07:45.521
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

07:45.555 --> 07:46.605
Pleasure doing business.

07:46.656 --> 07:47.923
I will enjoy
and pass this on.

07:47.958 --> 07:49.191
- Okay, man.
- Thank you. Have a good one.

07:49.209 --> 07:50.493
See you later.

07:50.527 --> 07:52.261
What'd you think?

07:52.295 --> 07:54.597
He looked pretty happy.

07:54.631 --> 07:56.665
That's what we're about here,
man, making people happy.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.234
Not me.
[laughs]

07:58.268 --> 08:00.569
We got to find that thing that
you're looking for, man, like,

08:00.604 --> 08:02.021
So you can
be like that guy.

08:02.055 --> 08:04.340
Something from your youth
that gave you such pleasure

08:04.374 --> 08:06.509
- That if you got it today...
- Mm-hmm.

08:06.543 --> 08:08.911
You'd be happy
for a good half-hour.

08:08.945 --> 08:10.546
[laughter]

08:12.682 --> 08:14.850
Thank you very much.
Have a great afternoon.

08:14.868 --> 08:15.851
See you soon.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.820
- Yep.
- Okay.

08:17.838 --> 08:21.507
- Have a good day, ray.
- See you guys.

08:21.541 --> 08:23.092
- Hey.
- What's up?

08:23.126 --> 08:24.193
Think we're--
think we're onto something.

08:24.227 --> 08:25.828
- Think we got him.
- What's that?

08:25.846 --> 08:27.329
We're working on the villains.
The villains are--

08:27.364 --> 08:28.330
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, the villains.

08:28.364 --> 08:30.032
What do you got?
Hit me.

08:30.066 --> 08:32.001
I tasked them
with coming up with

08:32.034 --> 08:36.138
Some vile and revolting villains
for the book.

08:36.173 --> 08:38.006
What did you
bring to it, man?

08:38.041 --> 08:40.609
I came up with
a character called wormhole.

08:40.644 --> 08:44.530
It was a little person whose
power is part of his deformity,

08:44.564 --> 08:47.383
So the more he uses his power,
it's sort of like a take on--

08:47.417 --> 08:49.118
- You lost me, mike. [laughs]
- Sorry. Yeah.

08:49.152 --> 08:50.986
- It's complicated.
- I lost them too.

08:51.021 --> 08:52.988
Literally looks like
a garbage pail kid.

08:53.023 --> 08:54.957
[laughs]

08:54.991 --> 08:57.159
I think you guys got to get
back to the drawing board.

08:57.194 --> 08:58.761
- Well, do you got anything?
- Yeah.

08:58.795 --> 09:01.397
- What do you got?
- All right, picture this.

09:01.431 --> 09:04.500
- Okay.
- Half man, half pig.

09:04.534 --> 09:05.935
Mm.

09:05.969 --> 09:07.436
I've always thought of--

09:07.471 --> 09:09.438
The pig's face
has always terrified me.

09:09.473 --> 09:11.257
Half man, half pig, huh?

09:11.291 --> 09:13.676
Yeah, but this one
is medieval.

09:13.710 --> 09:17.046
He wears like--like a mask--
like an iron mask.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.366
I like that.
An iron pig mask.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.419
Yeah. It's got piercings.
That's badass, right?

09:23.453 --> 09:24.987
Maybe use
some spikes on his face?

09:25.005 --> 09:27.907
Yes, spikes.
Like, metal.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.041
He's always looking
like he's pissed off.

09:29.075 --> 09:30.059
That's cool.

09:30.093 --> 09:31.426
Like, he's evil.

09:31.444 --> 09:32.444
Is he always looking that way
or is he always that way?

09:32.479 --> 09:34.363
He's always that way.

09:34.397 --> 09:35.531
All right.

09:35.565 --> 09:37.032
I mean, so far--
dude, I'm gonna sue you

09:37.067 --> 09:39.702
'cause this is me, half man,
half pig, always pissed off.

09:39.736 --> 09:40.803
[laughter]

09:40.837 --> 09:42.221
You've created a nightmare.

09:42.272 --> 09:44.106
Your character is gonna be
someone's nightmare one day.

09:44.140 --> 09:45.357
Yeah.

09:45.392 --> 09:46.909
And their gonna read the book
and be--and sleep and--

09:46.943 --> 09:49.078
"Oh, the pig man
in the leather mask."

09:49.112 --> 09:51.080
- [laughs]
- Wake up,

09:51.114 --> 09:52.715
- And you're gonna be responsible.
- Yeah.

09:52.749 --> 09:54.182
You've put a little misery
into the world.

09:54.201 --> 09:55.184
- It's great.
- I see.

09:55.218 --> 09:56.452
- It feels good, right?
- Yeah.

09:56.486 --> 09:58.354
[laughter]

09:58.388 --> 10:01.624
You've given us a lot
to go off with, man.

10:01.658 --> 10:04.326
- It's gonna be kick-ass.
- I can't wait.

10:04.361 --> 10:06.862
- Are you buying books here?
- Hey, what do you got?

10:06.897 --> 10:08.964
Open up the first page.

10:08.982 --> 10:11.500
It's autographed
by Frank Frazetta.

10:11.535 --> 10:12.535
No way.

10:15.362 --> 10:16.929
Ming,
what do you think, man?

10:16.964 --> 10:18.931
Who's your all-time,
number one baddie?

10:18.966 --> 10:20.133
I'm a little biased on this,

10:20.167 --> 10:21.601
But Ming the Merciless
from Flash Gordon.

10:21.635 --> 10:23.436
You know,
that makes sense, man.

10:23.470 --> 10:25.505
Here's a guy who's like,
"finally, someone on my side."

10:25.539 --> 10:27.140
[laughs]

10:27.174 --> 10:28.641
"someone whose name
is just like me."

10:28.675 --> 10:30.743
But if he's ming the merciless,
what are you?

10:30.761 --> 10:32.578
- I don't know.
- Ming the Pitiful?

10:32.613 --> 10:35.214
- Ming the Tolerant?
- Ming the Tolerant.

10:35.249 --> 10:36.849
[laughter]
- who else?

10:36.884 --> 10:38.784
Who else would be considered
a really good screen villain?

10:38.818 --> 10:41.020
Like, vader, I put probably
at the top of that list.

10:41.054 --> 10:44.357
Walt would argue with this,
but I would say it's Jaws.

10:44.391 --> 10:45.358
[laughs]

10:45.392 --> 10:47.026
First of all--
first of--first of--

10:47.060 --> 10:48.361
- [laughter]
- Ridicule immediately.

10:48.395 --> 10:49.896
You don't even finish
the "s" on "Jaws."

10:49.930 --> 10:51.197
He's like--[scoffs]

10:51.231 --> 10:52.949
First, he'd be like,
"Jaws wasn't his name."

10:52.983 --> 10:54.283
[laughter]
- that's true.

10:54.318 --> 10:56.936
He's got a point.
Jaws isn't his name.

10:56.954 --> 10:59.672
I think it's a stretch
to call an animal

10:59.690 --> 11:02.108
Who's just doing what he does,
his instincts, a villain.

11:02.142 --> 11:03.926
I bet you
if you lived in a village

11:03.977 --> 11:05.878
Where lions were running around
trying to eat you,

11:05.896 --> 11:07.146
You'd be like,
"that's a villain."

11:07.181 --> 11:08.915
- Yeah, I agree.
- Yeah, but I think it's

11:08.949 --> 11:10.783
A poor choice of words,
though, "villain."

11:10.817 --> 11:13.553
What if it was a were-shark?
Then he'd be a villain or--

11:13.587 --> 11:16.088
Yeah, he's in outer space.
[laughter]

11:28.670 --> 11:29.804
You know,
I'm going to the flea market

11:29.838 --> 11:32.139
Almost like a religious guy
going to church.

11:32.174 --> 11:33.157
I mean, it's really
getting out of control,

11:33.208 --> 11:34.441
And it's a matter
of getting there

11:34.459 --> 11:36.277
Early in the morning,
and you got to find stuff.

11:36.311 --> 11:39.046
But my new thing now is I got to
pay a little bit more money

11:39.081 --> 11:41.499
So--like,
trying to develop pickers

11:41.550 --> 11:43.951
So they start
bringing me stuff.

11:43.969 --> 11:46.153
An army of Rob Bruces.
Hey, how are you doing?

11:46.188 --> 11:50.024
- Are you buying books here?
- Maybe. What do you got?

11:50.058 --> 11:52.326
- Creepy 1.
- Ooh.

11:57.966 --> 12:01.035
Creepy, for those of you
that don't know,

12:01.069 --> 12:03.354
Pretty much is exactly
what the title implies.

12:03.388 --> 12:04.572
- [laughs]
- It was a magazine.

12:04.606 --> 12:06.340
Not so much a comic book,
but a magazine

12:06.375 --> 12:09.777
That was full of
not traditional comic book art,

12:09.811 --> 12:11.745
But a lot of fantasy art,
a lot of weirdness.

12:11.763 --> 12:14.715
It went all over the place.
It wasn't superheroes.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.817
Open up the first page.

12:16.852 --> 12:19.920
- Open up the first page?
- Open up the first page.

12:19.955 --> 12:23.758
It's autographed
by Jim Warren and dated.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.793
- What year is that?
- 1974.

12:25.827 --> 12:29.196
If you go up into
the Frazetta story...

12:29.231 --> 12:32.700
Here we go. It's autographed
by Frank Frazetta.

12:32.734 --> 12:33.901
No way.

12:33.935 --> 12:36.454
How rare is
the Frank Frazetta signature?

12:36.505 --> 12:37.671
Oh, you know,
it's Frank Frazetta.

12:37.706 --> 12:41.592
He's probably
the biggest illustrator

12:41.626 --> 12:43.544
Of the latter half
of the 20th century.

12:43.578 --> 12:45.746
I think his signature alone
is worth $200.

12:45.781 --> 12:47.948
But what are you looking
to get for your Creepy?

12:47.983 --> 12:50.885
- 450.
- 450?

12:50.919 --> 12:53.821
- What do you think, robert?
- The book's worth $35...

12:53.855 --> 12:55.706
Right. Right. I would--

12:55.757 --> 12:57.825
- Without the signatures.
- I agree.

12:57.859 --> 12:59.844
I'm just looking at the value
of the book with the signatures.

12:59.878 --> 13:03.047
And, you know, if you put
$35 and $75 and 200,

13:03.098 --> 13:04.365
And James Warren--

13:04.399 --> 13:08.352
So, 350 retail seems like
a real realistic price.

13:08.386 --> 13:10.521
Would you do 175?

13:10.555 --> 13:13.707
175? No.

13:13.742 --> 13:16.644
If my man tells me
I can get 350--

13:16.678 --> 13:18.729
That's the max I could
probably get it in here,

13:18.763 --> 13:21.398
I got to make
some money on it.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.851
You know, I know you got
to make some money on it,

13:23.885 --> 13:27.621
But 175 is,
for me, too low.

13:27.656 --> 13:29.557
- Throw me another number, then.
- 250?

13:29.591 --> 13:31.208
200.

13:31.243 --> 13:33.294
- That's my final offer.
- That's a fair price.

13:33.328 --> 13:34.395
200?

13:34.429 --> 13:36.780
- 200.
- Okay.

13:36.832 --> 13:37.965
- You gonna take 200?
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

13:37.999 --> 13:40.134
I was able to get it
down to 200 bucks.

13:40.168 --> 13:41.702
- No.
- Yeah.

13:41.736 --> 13:44.638
I contemplated, yeah, you know,
just taking it home for like--

13:44.656 --> 13:46.824
- I was gonna say--what--
- Buying it for myself.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.809
Is it on the wall
or is it at your place?

13:48.844 --> 13:49.844
I haven't decided yet.

13:49.878 --> 13:51.262
Every time I put it up
on the wall,

13:51.296 --> 13:53.430
I'd run back up
and I take it down, 'cause I--

13:53.465 --> 13:55.483
You know,
it's pretty special.

13:55.517 --> 13:56.850
Why don't you
split the difference?

13:56.868 --> 13:58.369
Put it up on the wall, and then
when people go to buy it,

13:58.403 --> 13:59.520
Just be like, "no!"

13:59.554 --> 14:01.655
[laughter]

14:01.690 --> 14:03.023
Nice meeting ya.

14:03.058 --> 14:04.108
- All right, thanks, man.
- All right, having a good one.

14:04.142 --> 14:05.442
- Safe home, man.
- See you later.

14:05.477 --> 14:09.063
Take care of that, please.

14:09.097 --> 14:12.349
With the way tech has gone
in the last 10, 15 years,

14:12.384 --> 14:16.136
Now, you can publish
a comic book off your iphone.

14:16.171 --> 14:18.405
You know, there's nothing
holding you back anymore.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.140
Are you guys
gonna self-publish?

14:20.175 --> 14:22.676
No, I thought
we would develop a pitch

14:22.711 --> 14:24.111
And bring it
to some of the companies

14:24.145 --> 14:26.447
That are producing
some comic books right now.

14:26.481 --> 14:29.350
- Then Bryan had an awesome idea.
- What's your awesome idea?

14:29.384 --> 14:33.254
To make a pitch video
that would accompany

14:33.288 --> 14:36.023
- The synopsis and the pages.
- That's smart, man,

14:36.057 --> 14:37.291
You're on
the cutting edge, dude.

14:37.325 --> 14:38.325
I am?
[laughter]

14:38.360 --> 14:40.294
Welcome.
You're right there.

14:40.328 --> 14:41.362
I'm too good
for these guys now.

14:41.396 --> 14:43.163
[laughter]

14:43.198 --> 14:45.833
Take one.

14:45.867 --> 14:46.867
All right.
You ready, Ming?

14:46.902 --> 14:48.269
Ready.

14:48.303 --> 14:49.603
Action, Ming.

14:54.376 --> 14:56.760
He's looking at us
the whole time.

14:56.795 --> 14:58.078
- What--let's cut.
- [laughs]

14:58.113 --> 14:59.263
- Jesus.
- What?

14:59.297 --> 15:02.216
You don't look at us
until you pass us.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.851
Did you study
the patterson video?

15:03.885 --> 15:06.020
I watched it,
like, 100 times.

15:06.054 --> 15:09.523
So, you know that bigfoot
isn't staring the entire time.

15:09.558 --> 15:10.591
He looks
over his shoulder.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.526
It's, like--
and he looks back.

15:12.561 --> 15:13.594
This isn't you
on a bench at the mall

15:13.612 --> 15:15.762
Sitting outside
Victoria's Secret.

15:15.780 --> 15:17.865
- [laughs]
- This is a cursory glance.

15:17.899 --> 15:18.966
Who'd you play?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.568
They dressed me
in a bigfoot outfit.

15:20.602 --> 15:22.002
They went to the littlest
person for bigfoot?

15:22.037 --> 15:25.606
- Uh...
- I was looking for irony.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.041
[laughter]
- well, done, man.

15:27.075 --> 15:28.642
Very artistic.
Very David Lynch-Ian.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.794
How was he as a director
this time around?

15:30.845 --> 15:33.480
You know, he's grown
since the last time

15:33.515 --> 15:34.715
He pulled out that hat,

15:34.749 --> 15:37.117
But still demanding as ever,
overbearing.

15:37.152 --> 15:39.787
Action, ming.
Wait a second.

15:39.821 --> 15:41.855
I'll tell you when you hear
the noise. Get back here!

15:41.890 --> 15:43.824
- Oh, come on.
- [laughs]

15:43.858 --> 15:44.959
Jesus.

15:44.993 --> 15:47.528
Action.

15:47.562 --> 15:49.330
And look.

15:49.364 --> 15:51.899
Oh!
All right, sorry. Sorry, sorry.

15:51.933 --> 15:53.434
- Dude.
- Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

15:53.468 --> 15:55.536
Come on, this costume's smelly.
Come on.

15:55.570 --> 15:58.005
You screw up two takes,
the third take is so-so,

15:58.039 --> 16:00.207
And you're--
you're frustrated with us.

16:00.241 --> 16:02.409
Face front,
true believers.

16:02.444 --> 16:04.478
I am stan lee,

16:04.512 --> 16:08.399
And I'd like to introduce you
to a great new comic book.

16:16.125 --> 16:19.060
- You nervous?
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

16:24.266 --> 16:25.533
- There you go.
- Thank you.

16:25.568 --> 16:26.868
Let's go.

16:30.339 --> 16:31.973
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, how you doing?

16:32.007 --> 16:34.142
Conference room's on over
here, you guys are expected.

16:34.176 --> 16:37.879
Dynamite Comics is a company
created by Nick Barrucci.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.647
They do stuff
like Green Hornet,

16:39.682 --> 16:43.885
Bionic Man, Red Sonja,
Lone Ranger.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.420
- Vampirella.
- Vampirella.

16:45.454 --> 16:47.422
So, they're
a huge comer, man.

16:47.456 --> 16:48.956
Like, this company's
only been around

16:48.974 --> 16:51.426
For the last
five to ten years,

16:51.460 --> 16:53.661
And they already
have a nice market share.

16:53.696 --> 16:55.396
So, that's a good
place to go, man.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.565
And they're
a new Jersey-based company,

16:57.583 --> 17:00.468
So we thought, you know,
couple of Jersey boys.

17:00.502 --> 17:02.070
Yes, yes.
Play that card.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.088
Definitely.
"what exit you from?"

17:04.123 --> 17:05.707
Yes.
- [laughs]

17:05.741 --> 17:08.108
- All right, guys, what's up?
- What do you got for us?

17:08.143 --> 17:10.144
Basically, these gentlemen
have come up with a concept

17:10.179 --> 17:12.313
- That you're gonna love.
- Okay.

17:12.348 --> 17:13.815
We have a little
video presentation...

17:13.848 --> 17:15.950
- All right.
- With an introduction by...

17:15.984 --> 17:17.417
Both: Someone.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.354
- Some dude.
- Pretty--pretty special.

17:19.387 --> 17:20.354
- Huh. Yeah?
- A living legend.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.246
- [laughs]
- Okay.

17:21.265 --> 17:22.248
- Are you ready, Walt?
- Ready.

17:22.281 --> 17:23.866
All right.

17:23.916 --> 17:25.251
Face front,
true believers...

17:25.285 --> 17:28.252
- Oh, wow.
- I am stan lee,

17:28.271 --> 17:31.857
And I'd like to introduce you
to a great new comic book.

17:31.892 --> 17:34.927
Never before
in the history of comics

17:34.962 --> 17:39.532
Has their been such
unadulterated originality,

17:39.566 --> 17:42.234
Such flawless artistry,

17:42.269 --> 17:45.104
Such crackerjack prose--

17:45.138 --> 17:47.406
Oh, come on,
you guys. Oh, gee.

17:47.424 --> 17:48.758
[laughs]

17:48.792 --> 17:50.810
Anyway, I give you

17:50.844 --> 17:53.946
The cryptozoic man.

17:53.981 --> 17:57.683
Sasquatch.

17:57.718 --> 17:59.352
[chuckling]

17:59.386 --> 18:03.189
The Loch Ness Monster.
[creature bellows]

18:03.223 --> 18:04.190
[laughs]

18:04.224 --> 18:09.061
The Jersey Devil.

18:09.096 --> 18:11.097
[growls]

18:13.567 --> 18:16.335
The dna of man and brute

18:16.370 --> 18:18.404
Bound with one purpose...

18:18.438 --> 18:23.275
To annihilate
those called legion.

18:23.310 --> 18:27.079
Monsters creat by monsters.

18:33.754 --> 18:38.090
Desperate abominations
roused from oblivion...

18:39.359 --> 18:44.163
Lacerated nightmares
bled into consciousness...

18:44.197 --> 18:48.768
Iniquity, transcendence.

18:50.470 --> 18:53.372
The Cryptozoic Man!

18:53.407 --> 18:55.875
Excelsior! I guess...

18:55.909 --> 18:57.142
[laughter]

18:57.160 --> 18:58.310
What do you think?

18:58.328 --> 18:59.812
I think it's really cool

18:59.830 --> 19:01.163
That you guys got stan
to pitch her for you.

19:01.198 --> 19:02.648
That's awesome.

19:02.666 --> 19:04.283
But I think we need to hear
the words out of your mouths.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.285
[laughs]
I didn't account for this.

19:06.319 --> 19:07.420
[laughter]

19:07.454 --> 19:10.656
We envisioned
a five-issue mini series

19:10.691 --> 19:12.925
Where it's
kind of a throwback

19:12.943 --> 19:17.129
To an '80s swamp thing vibe

19:17.164 --> 19:20.199
Where a man is transformed
into a monster,

19:20.233 --> 19:23.936
- But a good monster, and...
- There's a little girl.

19:23.970 --> 19:25.371
- [laughs]
- And there's a little girl.

19:25.405 --> 19:29.341
It's the smorgasbord
of everything we grew up on--

19:29.375 --> 19:32.144
Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster,
Jersey Devil,

19:32.179 --> 19:34.096
Cryptozoic creatures.

19:34.147 --> 19:37.083
We're obviously going for
a creepiest vibe as possible,

19:37.117 --> 19:40.252
Still with a little bit
of superhero aspects to it

19:40.287 --> 19:43.172
'cause we do have a good guy
who doesn't look like a good guy

19:43.206 --> 19:46.225
But is still, you know,
our hero at the end of the day.

19:46.259 --> 19:47.359
I love the "puppy wuv"
on the shirt.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.395
[laughter]
Does he access-does he--

19:49.429 --> 19:51.080
- You throw that in on your own?
- Yes.

19:51.131 --> 19:52.131
Cool.

19:52.165 --> 19:53.833
And who's doing
the writing?

19:53.867 --> 19:55.284
Bryan will be
doing the writing.

19:55.335 --> 19:56.735
The scripting, yeah.

19:56.753 --> 19:57.970
These guys have come up with
some of the character concepts.

19:58.004 --> 19:59.405
Okay.

19:59.439 --> 20:00.923
They will be
selling the comic.

20:00.957 --> 20:02.074
[laughter]

20:02.109 --> 20:04.927
The good thing is
you guys are passionate.

20:04.978 --> 20:08.364
You guys have really
thought about the backstory.

20:08.398 --> 20:10.282
You have a direction
you want to go in.

20:10.317 --> 20:12.952
- It's approved.
- Oh, thank you so much.

20:12.986 --> 20:14.336
Still some--still some work
to be done, but nothing...

20:14.371 --> 20:15.538
Yeah.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.539
Nothing that we think
we can't work out.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.957
- Yep.
- We love it.

20:17.991 --> 20:19.725
- They're gonna do it?
- They're gonna do it.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.545
Give it up, man.
That's fantastic.

20:22.579 --> 20:25.381
Look at you guys.
Published as a team. So, wait--

20:25.415 --> 20:27.366
Four creator title's
gonna be on the cover?

20:27.384 --> 20:30.236
- Ah--[laughs]
- Oh, wow, wow.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.271
[laughs] I see.
- [laughs]

20:32.305 --> 20:33.422
Wow, man, so, like,

20:33.473 --> 20:35.374
With the publication
of that comic book,

20:35.392 --> 20:38.444
You guys will literally
become comic book men.

20:38.478 --> 20:40.746
[laughter]

20:40.781 --> 20:43.682
That's gonna wrap it up
for an entrepreneurial week

20:43.717 --> 20:44.884
Of Comic Book Men,

20:44.918 --> 20:47.119
Once again, where nobody
works at the store.

20:47.153 --> 20:48.320
- [laughs]
- I'm Kevin Smith.

20:48.355 --> 20:50.189
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:50.223 --> 20:51.724
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:51.758 --> 20:53.926
Titans together, kids.
Good night.
