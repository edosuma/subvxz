00:58.240 --> 00:59.730
What's the Haven?

01:00.600 --> 01:02.329
You were in the army, weren't you?

01:03.880 --> 01:05.086
Iraq.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.966
Well, then, you should feel
very much at home.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.450
What's this?

01:21.520 --> 01:25.002
That is a coded account summary

01:25.240 --> 01:27.049
of the entire operation.

01:28.080 --> 01:31.004
A complete list of people
cash-flowing the deal,

01:33.040 --> 01:36.283
a summary of expenses,
names of consultants,

01:36.360 --> 01:38.931
profit margins, the whole shooting match.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.285
And yet somehow

01:42.400 --> 01:44.562
this found its way into the hands

01:44.640 --> 01:48.361
of a British enforcement official
called Angela Burr.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.049
Now, here's the problem.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.683
There are only two people in the world
who have that list in their possession.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.766
Sandy Langbourne, and me.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.050
So how did Angela Burr get it?

02:09.080 --> 02:11.082
There's, um, Sandy.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.366
He'd never betray you.

02:15.360 --> 02:18.091
Anyone can betray anyone, Jonathan.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.729
You should know that.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.131
Whose handwriting is this?

02:24.200 --> 02:25.406
Apostol.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.802
Our Spanish lawyer friend.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.927
It's why he's no longer with us.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.440
You should call off the sale.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.881
Oh, they would love that.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.367
Whitehall pricks in the foyer.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.803
I'm not gonna give up that easy.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.242
I'll just have to plug the leak.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.282
Is it Langbourne? Corkoran?

02:51.360 --> 02:52.805
Jed.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.360
Or you.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.971
Is it you, Jonathan?

03:04.560 --> 03:05.561
No.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.969
Well, whoever it is,

03:14.880 --> 03:17.850
they are living on borrowed time.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.600
Good trip, sir?

03:36.680 --> 03:38.330
Very good, jasper, thank you, yes.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.004
May I introduce Mr Andrew Birch,

03:40.080 --> 03:41.366
Director of Tradepass.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.682
We will be facilitating Mr Birch's sale.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.088
Pleasure to meet you, Mr Birch.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.290
I assume Mr Birch's
merchandise got here safely?

03:49.680 --> 03:53.207
The trucks arrived this morning.
You missed a hell of a storm last night, sir.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.530
It is not a fair world.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.641
No, it isn't.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.406
Syrian border's
200 miles to the south.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.960
Refugee camps are all around us here.

04:24.600 --> 04:28.571
They come here with nothing,
lives ripped apart, homes destroyed.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.209
Who are the taxis for?

04:31.280 --> 04:34.921
The Western aid workers
who can't get to the airport fast enough.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.888
Still, we do our bit, don't we, Jasper?

04:37.960 --> 04:39.086
Yes, sir.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.720
This is our little contribution.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.691
A safe haven for the wretched of the Earth.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.082
Hello, hello. How are you? How are you?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.480
Hello, how are you?

05:05.560 --> 05:07.085
How are you? How are you, young man?

05:09.520 --> 05:11.807
<i>Assalam alaikum.</i>
Let's see what we have here.

05:13.720 --> 05:16.644
There we go.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.724
Oh, my goodness!
See if we can get a picture.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.406
Let's smile at the camera, shall we?
Excellent.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.642
Can you carry a box all on your own?
You stay there.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.560
You see if you can carry
this all on your own.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.365
There you go.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.085
All right, very nice to see you.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.290
Justifies us being here.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.204
Means no one asks any questions
about our other activities.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.726
Right, Tabby, collect all the phones.
No calls in or out.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.007
Frisky, see if you can get Mr Birch
some suitable gear.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.006
- Site been cleared?
- Happening as we speak, sir.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.446
Firework display. You're in charge.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.166
You've got a lot of homework to do.
Make sure you know what you're selling.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.730
Sir, this way.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.570
Welcome to the Haven.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.691
Er, you asked to see me.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.410
Rex.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.807
The royal household have been in touch.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.130
Informally, so don't go
spreading it around.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.483
The Palace do tend to get rather edgy
about that sort of thing.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.167
They're looking for a
new private secretary.

07:25.240 --> 07:29.165
Some rookie's made too many mistakes
and they want someone with

07:29.480 --> 07:32.450
tact and experience to
take over the position.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.129
Tea with the Queen.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.525
Nice work if you can get it.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.728
And I'm... I'm going to get it, am I?

07:43.080 --> 07:45.367
Well, only if you want it.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.241
Of course.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.324
The private jet left Istanbul
at 8:20 a.m.,

07:53.520 --> 07:55.727
but we have no satellite information
after that.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.926
Why not?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.765
The Turks say they need a
higher-level request for all flight intel.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.966
So get me one.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.201
I've tried, ma'am.
They said no.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.011
I've lost my boy and I need to know
where he is!

08:05.080 --> 08:06.605
Right, so this is what we know.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.808
A British ship called the <i>Leila Jane</i>

08:08.880 --> 08:10.484
docked in Istanbul two days ago.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.365
It's got no right to be anywhere near Istanbul,
it should be in the Azores

08:13.440 --> 08:15.283
and it should be full of crop sprayers.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.561
Now it's gone again.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.803
But cargo was taken off in Istanbul
and her cargo was this.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.448
British and American arms.
Seven new deals in the last month.

08:23.960 --> 08:26.611
Now, they're selling to a no-go customer
somewhere in the Middle East

08:26.680 --> 08:28.250
and the middle man is Richard Roper.

08:28.320 --> 08:32.006
He is going to Turkey to meet the buyer
at a place called the Haven.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.923
I need more money,
I need personnel on the ground.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.480
And I need somebody to tell
me where the bloody hell my agent is!

08:36.559 --> 08:37.765
Listen. Listen.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.327
The Permanent Secretary has requested

08:44.760 --> 08:47.001
that I no longer manage
enforcement agencies.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.326
As of the end of this week,

08:51.800 --> 08:53.290
I'll be reassigned.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.367
The Permanent Secretary leaked
my intelligence to Dromgoole.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.922
- She's part of it.
- Her job is to preserve the status quo.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.126
Whatever it takes.

09:14.120 --> 09:18.284
When a continent enters into chaos,
that's when opportunities open up.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.764
The British knew it in China,
the Yanks in South America.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.884
I'm doing the same here.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.043
We can train armies to fight in deserts,

09:26.120 --> 09:29.090
mountains, we can teach them
anti-guerrilla tactics,

09:29.160 --> 09:30.764
how to deal with political insurgency.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.970
And for a small surcharge,

09:33.040 --> 09:36.044
we can even send in teams of our own
to deal with specific targets.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.490
Assassinations,

09:38.560 --> 09:41.166
fake terror plots, even the odd coup.
Can't we, Jasper?

09:41.400 --> 09:42.640
Yes, sir.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.800
Jasper looks like a teddy bear, but don't
let him near your neck on a bad day.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.803
- Good to see you, sir.
- How are you, Aiden?

09:49.880 --> 09:52.406
Good. Looking forward to playing
with the new toys.

09:52.480 --> 09:53.641
Boys keeping fit?

09:53.720 --> 09:55.484
Not a bad set-up, is it?

09:55.560 --> 09:57.050
It's unbelievable.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.884
- He's got his own country.
- Not just a country, old boy.

10:01.840 --> 10:02.887
This is a kingdom.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.882
Look sharp! Mr Roper on deck!

10:18.920 --> 10:20.640
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.243
All right. All right. All right.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.729
You fellows been busy while I've been gone?

10:28.040 --> 10:30.247
All ready for you, Chief. Spick and span.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.522
Glad to hear it. Andrew, come here.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.247
Cos Mr Birch, here, wants to put
on a good show for our guests tonight.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.800
So I want you to give him
all the help he needs.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.563
He has worn khaki himself,

10:41.640 --> 10:43.961
so don't feel you need to talk pretty.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.681
Andrew Birch. Which regiment were you in?

10:49.760 --> 10:51.250
First Battalion, Fusiliers.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.446
You lost two men in Basra, 2005.
I was there.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.568
Yes, sir. Good friends of mine.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.401
- Why'd you leave?
- Same as you, I'd imagine.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.768
I'd done three tours.
Time to cash in the chips.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.161
And become a mercenary.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.211
Every soldier fights for money, Andrew,
if he's got half a brain.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.524
You were paid in Iraq, weren't you?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.287
These men are selling their skills,
same as anyone else.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.010
Yeah!

11:15.080 --> 11:16.286
Actually, no, not the same.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.681
What you're looking at here
is the real United Nations.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.768
Yes!

11:20.920 --> 11:25.448
You've got Americans, Russians,
Ukrainians, Serbs, Croats, Angolans...

11:25.600 --> 11:27.204
Latvian, come on!

11:27.280 --> 11:29.200
One Latvian, but a very loud one.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.566
All living, working together.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.285
One big happy family.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.371
Aye, but with no mum!

11:42.400 --> 11:45.131
Well, in that case, I will be mother.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.288
Don't be a tit, Sandy.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.731
These men are about to operate
some extremely heavy machinery.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.680
Besides, they wouldn't be anything
like cold enough.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.291
How have you been, Alexei?
Leg all right?

12:03.080 --> 12:04.605
Something's wrong.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.564
He's treating me like
I just shot his mother.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.484
He thinks there might be a rotten apple.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.004
What d'you mean?

12:15.960 --> 12:17.564
Don't be ridiculous.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.088
Mr Barghati.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.965
<i>Walaikum assalam,</i> Mr Birch.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.202
Just this way. Please have some tea.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.328
OK, jasper, let's start the show.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.925
Yes, sir.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.890
- Frisky, you're gonna need these.
- Cheers, Jas...

13:45.960 --> 13:47.560
- Mr Langbourne, sir.
- Thank you.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.443
- Mr Barghati, sir.
- Thank you.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.487
- Will it be loud?
- I certainly hope so, sir.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.961
This is Guy Fawkes.
All players on the flare in 10.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.407
<i>Copy, Guy Fawkes,
on the flare in 10.</i>

14:01.480 --> 14:04.927
Mr Barghati. Would you care
to do the honours?

14:05.200 --> 14:07.248
Why not. Thank you.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.447
Forty-five degrees straight into the sky.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.290
It has little bit of a kick.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.244
Thank you, sir.

14:29.160 --> 14:33.370
Ah... We appear to have a visitor.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.684
Friend of yours, Mr Barghati?

14:36.960 --> 14:38.928
It's very hard to tell.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.881
Unless biometric software
identifies enemy contact.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.330
The FGM Javelin light anti-tank missile.

14:50.480 --> 14:54.530
A fire-and-forget system with
an effective range of up to 2,500 metres.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.170
Who was driving that car?

14:56.240 --> 14:58.607
Don't worry, sir. Here he is.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.523
And would you believe it, Mr Barghati,

15:00.600 --> 15:02.364
he doesn't even have a driving license?

15:04.680 --> 15:08.605
It has a tandem warhead
fitted with two shaped charges,

15:08.720 --> 15:12.088
guaranteed for penetration of surface
and base reactive armour.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.725
They're using four-to-one tracer
for our benefit, Mr Barghati.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.531
Of course in reality, IR guidance would
render that unnecessary.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.081
Pretty, though.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.211
FIM Stinger...

15:33.400 --> 15:35.721
A man-portable surface-to-air missile,

15:36.320 --> 15:37.924
weighing only 15 kilograms.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.449
The new 92F model contains a rollover
sensor and modified control software.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.889
You miss it, do you?

16:00.200 --> 16:03.921
Being down there with burnt cork
on your face, dagger in your teeth.

16:05.880 --> 16:09.202
No, not at all.
I'd much rather be up here watching,

16:09.280 --> 16:11.328
- thank you.
- Quite right, too.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.648
War as spectator sport.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.844
We are emperors of Rome, Andrew.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.327
Blood and steel, the only elements
that ever meant anything.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.049
Now, Mr Barghati,

16:29.120 --> 16:31.407
we have taken the liberty of assuming
neither you nor

16:31.600 --> 16:35.810
the other members of your consortium
are signatories to the Oslo Convention.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.243
UN takes a rather dim view
of cluster munitions on the basis that,

16:40.320 --> 16:45.042
and I quote, "They pose an indiscriminate
threat to the civilian population."

16:46.560 --> 16:49.530
We prefer to use the term "democratic".

17:07.240 --> 17:08.969
Do you agree with my definition?

17:11.119 --> 17:12.848
- Yes.
- Good.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.609
Now, the grand finale.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.804
Pay close attention.
We cleared a whole village for this bit.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.802
Nothing quite as pretty as napalm at night.

18:01.520 --> 18:05.411
Hard to get a hold of these days, of course.
But then, that's why you come to us.

18:16.160 --> 18:19.004
Oh, you're very kind.
Thank you. Thank you.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.844
Mr Barghati, safe journey.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.126
Goodbye, Mr Birch.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.090
I will be singing your praises
to my consortium.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.880
Well, do send them
my best wishes.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.246
Where are you flying to, sir?

18:29.320 --> 18:31.561
Ah, that's a question you do not ask.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.405
Just as I do not ask
where the goods came from.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.400
It is a long and noble tradition.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.768
The supplier is silent, the buyer is discreet,
and business is done.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.088
I went to London School of Economics.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.522
- I learnt everything I know in your capital city.
- Did you?

18:47.600 --> 18:49.807
- Do send it my best wishes.
- I will.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.884
Mr Barghati, your carriage awaits.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.288
Hope you have a very pleasant,
safe journey.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.480
- My best to your family, of course.
- Thank you.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.651
Do you know I have, er,

19:01.720 --> 19:04.530
a couple of tickets for the French Open
later in the year if you're interested.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.444
If that, er... I don't know if
that's something you would enjoy.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.204
That would be
absolutely wonderful.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.965
Splendid.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.160
- Thank you.
- Have a safe journey again.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.289
I've left Pearl with a small team in Istanbul,
in case our boy makes contact.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.044
Yeah. What chance of that?

20:16.160 --> 20:19.448
Joel's advised we burn our boy completely.
He thinks Roper's turned him.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.444
What do you think?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.404
Well, he attacked our own people.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.721
Whether he wanted to or he had to,
I don't know.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.448
And I tried to get access to those

20:29.520 --> 20:33.923
bank accounts of the, er, companies on
the Tradepass list. Every request blocked.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.761
I need a sodding warrant and I can't get
a warrant cos I don't have the authority.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.565
And...

20:40.560 --> 20:42.210
I think I am being followed.

20:42.280 --> 20:45.400
Cos when I left the house this morning,
there was a car at the end of the road.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.923
Might you have imagined it?

20:48.160 --> 20:49.810
- I'm just saying, you're tired.
- Yeah, I'm tired.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.291
I'm pregnant. I'm emotional.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.771
I saw a car.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.085
Yeah, all right.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.084
God damn it.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.567
What is it?

21:01.720 --> 21:03.324
Limpet's been closed down.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.084
Funding withdrawn.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.487
- Whose authority?
- All I know is we're being mothballed.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.688
I'm being called back
to Washington this afternoon.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.730
God damn it. Back to chasing
Mexican gunrunners in Arizona.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.370
Well, is there anything
you can do about it?

21:15.440 --> 21:17.363
Not a goddamn thing. I'm sorry.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.601
There's just too many people who
don't want us doing what we're doing.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.845
When was the last time you got some rest?

21:31.920 --> 21:33.640
Why don't you go home, get some sleep, huh?

21:34.200 --> 21:35.804
Come on.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.211
It's OK.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.245
It's not like him to mix business
with pleasure.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.083
Jed, darling. How was your trip?

22:45.440 --> 22:46.851
It was fine.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.530
Not too bumpy?

22:49.160 --> 22:50.924
You look gorgeous.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.881
- Corky.
- Sweetie.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.087
Andrew, come and join us.

23:12.200 --> 23:16.603
Having a drink to celebrate.
I've allowed Sandy to unleash the Moët '73.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.604
The trucks are in the Turkish mountains,

23:18.680 --> 23:21.331
should be at the Syrian border
at 6:00 p.m. tomorrow, give or take.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.290
- Great.
- In the meantime, I suggest a toast

23:24.360 --> 23:27.011
to Tradepass and all those who sail in her.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.528
I think that's something
we can all drink to.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.324
Can't we?

23:36.280 --> 23:38.009
Good Christ, what a miserable bunch.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.168
We've just had a triumphant opening night.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.805
The reviews are in. We're a big hit!

23:41.880 --> 23:43.644
- Here's to us!
- Here's to us.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.890
- Tradepass.
- Tradepass.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.324
Corky, why aren't you drinking?

23:48.520 --> 23:49.521
I'm off it, Chief.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.004
- Off it?
- Taking a break.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.810
- Sandy... Better be calling the brothers.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:01.800 --> 24:02.926
How are you, Andrew?

24:03.920 --> 24:05.649
Fighting fit. Thank you.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.686
You seem very at home here.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.567
Do I?

24:11.320 --> 24:13.926
Who can blame him, darling?
All these uniforms.

24:14.920 --> 24:18.003
Still, it's not as pretty
as the seaside cottage, is it?

24:20.200 --> 24:21.804
Not as romantic.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.284
Did I say something untoward?

24:41.520 --> 24:45.491
- I should really, uh, get some rest.
- You can sleep when you're dead.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.644
I don't know if it has occurred to you
why he brought her here.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.451
I'm just an outside observer,
you've made sure of that,

24:52.520 --> 24:54.602
but from where I'm sitting,

24:55.280 --> 24:56.725
it doesn't look very good.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.923
It doesn't look very good at all.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.645
Angela Burr.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.765
<i>Dromgoole here.</i>

26:34.840 --> 26:36.842
<i>I wondered if you were
free for a tête-à-tête?</i>

26:37.240 --> 26:38.890
Er, I'm asleep.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.043
<i>You don't look asleep.</i>

26:49.360 --> 26:50.691
<i>I'm alone.</i>

27:17.280 --> 27:18.611
Are you going to let me in?

27:19.200 --> 27:20.326
We can talk just fine here.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.804
I like you, Angela.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.165
I admire your tenacity.

27:26.520 --> 27:30.206
It was always a source of regret to me that
we lost you from The River.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.121
What do you want?

27:35.720 --> 27:38.530
I wanted to ask where you got those papers.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.601
What papers?

27:41.120 --> 27:42.929
The ones you took to Apostol

27:43.000 --> 27:45.810
that resulted in some Arab
cutting his neck open.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.845
Oh, it was an Arab, was it?

27:48.920 --> 27:51.366
They're doing business with Richard Roper,

27:51.440 --> 27:54.967
and well, they don't appreciate
a lawyer they can't trust.

27:56.280 --> 27:58.931
And you? Are you doing business
with Richard Roper, too?

28:00.960 --> 28:04.407
I'm looking after the strategic
interests of my country, Angela.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.245
And lining your pockets.

28:07.320 --> 28:10.200
- Where did you get the papers?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.127
You've been lying to me about Limpet.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.442
You've had someone on the inside all along.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.686
I need to know who.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.725
This isn't just about me.

28:27.720 --> 28:30.883
There is a whole system
that keeps our country where we want it,

28:31.240 --> 28:33.402
amongst the elites,
punching above our weight.

28:34.320 --> 28:35.765
Well, it's a state of being.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.245
An ontology, if you like.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.682
And it has to be maintained.

28:41.840 --> 28:42.841
I mean,

28:43.280 --> 28:46.045
we need Richard Roper.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.605
America needs Richard Roper.

28:48.680 --> 28:49.920
Whether you like it or not.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.651
For your own safety,

28:54.720 --> 28:57.405
do not get in the way.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.602
- Good night, Geoffrey.
- I wouldn't close the door.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.804
- Angela?
- Yeah?

29:13.520 --> 29:14.681
Who was that?

29:15.080 --> 29:16.889
No, it's nothing, love. Go back to sleep.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.406
What happened to all the lights?

29:43.920 --> 29:44.921
They'll fix it.

29:45.920 --> 29:46.967
Happens all the time.

29:48.800 --> 29:49.847
Just relax.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.326
How can I relax?

29:51.400 --> 29:53.368
I'm in a goddamn army base, Roper.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.965
I'm the only woman here.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.082
Do you any idea how humiliating that is?

29:58.200 --> 29:59.690
You see the way they all look at me.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.525
Thought you might enjoy the attention.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.241
Don't be stupid.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.890
Just tell me why I'm here.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.640
You never bring me anywhere
near your work.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.606
You wanted to come.

30:12.640 --> 30:13.687
Didn't you?

30:15.680 --> 30:17.409
Well, now that you're here,

30:17.480 --> 30:20.882
someone has been prying into my affairs.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.284
Perhaps you can help me work out who.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.920
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.526
Is it you?

30:34.800 --> 30:39.089
Listen, I really want to keep
this between you and me.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.401
Why don't you start by just
telling me the truth?

30:45.880 --> 30:47.450
What did you do with the list?

30:50.840 --> 30:51.887
What list?

30:54.840 --> 30:56.251
Who did you show it to?

30:58.240 --> 31:00.288
I don't know what you're
talking about, baby.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.884
- Excuse me, Chief.
- What?

31:03.960 --> 31:05.371
There's a problem with the genny.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.886
I know there's a problem
with the genny, fix it!

31:07.960 --> 31:09.644
No, it looks deliberate, boss.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.804
Stay exactly where you are.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.491
Jed.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.367
OK.

31:47.240 --> 31:50.210
- Get me out of here, Jonathan.
- I can't. Not now.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.250
Tell me exactly who you are.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.970
I was sent in by British Intelligence

31:59.040 --> 32:00.724
to track Roper's arms operation.

32:03.240 --> 32:06.084
- No. But you saved Danny's life.
- A set-up.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.650
- No, you were injured, you almost died.
- That was part of the plan.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.366
And the list?

32:13.120 --> 32:15.202
The list contains the names
of every single person

32:15.280 --> 32:17.521
who's financially invested
in Roper's illegal deal

32:17.600 --> 32:18.726
of standard and chemical weapons.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.960
That's what I was doing in his office.
That's who I am.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.931
What do you need me to do?

32:26.440 --> 32:27.805
You let Corky take the hit.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.450
I can't, Jonathan. Corky's my friend.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.126
Corky is a trained killer.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.730
Now, I need money. As much as you have.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.960
Notes. Doesn't matter which
currency, dollars are best.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.971
- That's all I have.
- That's good.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.963
- I'm sorry.
- I'm going to get you out of here.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.087
I promise.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.241
I took a photograph of
your list on my phone.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.007
I'm sorry.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.844
Why on earth did you do that?

33:44.960 --> 33:46.928
Because I wanted to know what
the man I'm sleeping with

33:47.000 --> 33:48.445
does for a living.

33:51.480 --> 33:53.801
- Why didn't you ask me?
- You'd never tell me the truth.

33:55.720 --> 33:59.122
I just... I thought I could find out
on my own, so I took a photograph.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.004
I was gonna ask someone what it meant.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.166
Who were you gonna ask?

34:05.360 --> 34:06.441
I don't know.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.041
I didn't do anything, I promise.
I just deleted it.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.887
How much later did you delete it?

34:13.920 --> 34:14.967
A week?

34:15.040 --> 34:17.360
- You didn't show it to anyone?
- No, no one.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.684
I mean, I always leave it lying around.

34:22.719 --> 34:24.722
Corky told me not to leave it lying around.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.331
What do you mean, "Corky"?

34:29.719 --> 34:31.290
He found it, he gave it back to me.

34:35.320 --> 34:36.560
I'm so sorry,

34:36.960 --> 34:39.201
I've caused you so much trouble.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.684
It was so stupid of me.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.007
It's all right.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.164
It's nothing we can't solve.

34:53.560 --> 34:56.723
But you must never,
ever do that to me again.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.406
No, I never will. Ever.

35:00.920 --> 35:01.967
Good.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.362
Cos you know I love you very much.

35:07.680 --> 35:08.761
I love you, too.

36:26.240 --> 36:27.287
Who are you?

36:28.040 --> 36:29.849
I work at the camp.
Have you come across the border?

36:29.920 --> 36:32.287
No. We are from the village.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.408
- Which village?
- They bombed it.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.969
The British man said we had to leave.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.485
Come and see.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.282
She was too old to leave.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.610
We are going to the camp.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.922
I am going to show her
to the man who did this.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.402
Don't. For your son's sake, turn around.
Go back the way you came.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.007
Airport?

37:31.360 --> 37:33.044
It's a longer journey, I'm afraid.

37:33.160 --> 37:36.243
Wait here for one minute,
then drive directly to Istanbul.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.610
The Bosphorus Grand Hotel.

37:39.080 --> 37:41.242
There'll be a woman waiting
for you, Room 314.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.240
You give her this note.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.201
$200.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.444
There'll be 200 waiting for you
when you get there.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.647
No problem.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.524
Not my boy! Not my boy!

38:08.080 --> 38:09.127
No!

38:28.440 --> 38:30.442
Been bunking off again, old chap?

38:34.320 --> 38:36.163
You can go to detention for that, you know.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.844
It's your word against mine.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.604
That's a risk I have to take.

39:02.200 --> 39:06.603
I'm gonna kill you now, understand?

39:08.160 --> 39:10.401
I've been waiting for this moment!

39:32.760 --> 39:33.886
Who are you?

39:33.960 --> 39:35.724
I caught him coming back through the fence.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.290
Get the chief! We need him to talk.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.121
Jesus.

40:01.520 --> 40:03.648
- What the hell happened?
- I found him at the fence.

40:04.280 --> 40:06.487
I... I don't know
how long he was outside.

40:07.160 --> 40:08.446
He may have met someone.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.161
Jesus.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.730
We need to get him buried quick.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.569
No one can know he was here. All right?

40:30.520 --> 40:32.602
Jesus. Corky, Corky, Corky.

40:52.880 --> 40:55.201
That was the smallest grave I've ever dug.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.840
I could have got you in there, big boy.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.201
Hey!

41:00.680 --> 41:01.727
Hi, guys.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.564
- Who are you?
- Madam, I drove all night.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.563
I am to give you this.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.962
He said you would give me another $200

42:11.040 --> 42:12.451
if I got here by 9:00.

42:12.520 --> 42:15.171
Yes, I think we can manage that.

42:19.440 --> 42:21.280
- Where is it?
- Here.

42:22.400 --> 42:24.448
Oh, my God. He did it.

42:26.680 --> 42:27.761
Get me Mayhew on the phone.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.320
It's southeast Turkey.
We think it's somewhere near Kasmili.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.482
The trucks are heading towards
the Syrian border.

42:32.560 --> 42:33.721
That's just over 200 miles.

42:33.800 --> 42:35.280
- Rough country.
- Can't reach Mayhew.

42:35.320 --> 42:36.810
Well, that gives us three hours

42:36.880 --> 42:38.245
to find the trucks and stop them
before the border.

42:38.320 --> 42:40.400
It's his last day.
They're saying he's not available.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.006
I need to see Mayhew.

42:54.080 --> 42:55.286
I am afraid he is not available.

42:55.360 --> 42:57.442
- He is for me.
- Hey! Hey!

42:57.520 --> 42:58.567
I'm calling the police!

42:58.640 --> 42:59.880
I am the bloody police.

43:01.240 --> 43:02.810
Twenty aid trucks

43:02.880 --> 43:05.121
going to the Syrian border.
All containing illegally

43:05.200 --> 43:06.690
exported US and UK arms.

43:06.800 --> 43:08.245
Roper's fingerprints all over them.

43:09.160 --> 43:10.321
This is real, Rex.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.440
This is what we need
to take them down. All of them.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.447
I told you.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.446
We can't do anything.

43:18.520 --> 43:19.646
We have no allies.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.051
I don't need allies.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.610
I need a Foreign Office mandate

43:22.680 --> 43:25.445
confirming the illegal cache
of these weapons is in those trucks.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.409
I can take that to Joel Steadman.

43:27.520 --> 43:30.171
He can deploy US troops at the border
to stop the convoy,

43:30.240 --> 43:32.004
search the trucks, and seize the weapons.

43:32.720 --> 43:35.769
But I can't do that without
FCO top brass confirmation.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.808
One letter from you, Rex,

43:37.880 --> 43:39.245
representing the Permanent Secretary.

43:39.320 --> 43:40.401
One signature.

43:42.280 --> 43:44.601
Please, Rex.
As of today you're still in position.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.850
We will never get this chance again.

44:17.680 --> 44:18.681
Steadman.

44:18.760 --> 44:20.808
Joel, listen. I'm gonna fax
something through to you now.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.880
It's from our boy.
Tell me what you can do with it.

44:23.640 --> 44:24.971
Take it straight to the military.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.088
No Langley involvement. Is that clear?

44:28.320 --> 44:29.367
Sure.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.646
OK.

44:46.200 --> 44:48.248
Get me Commander Nichols, please.

44:59.680 --> 45:00.727
Thank you.

45:05.880 --> 45:06.927
ETA?

45:07.640 --> 45:09.688
The convoy should be through
the border in one hour, sir.

45:09.800 --> 45:11.720
We have their signal
if you'd like to track them.

45:11.840 --> 45:12.921
Yes, please.

45:30.480 --> 45:31.561
Andrew?

45:32.440 --> 45:33.487
Hi.

45:42.680 --> 45:44.409
- Yes?
<i>- This is your American friend.</i>

45:44.480 --> 45:45.527
What news?

45:45.600 --> 45:48.809
Authorisation received
by US military to seize and search

45:48.880 --> 45:52.441
the convoy of 20 aid trucks,
1800 hours local time

45:52.520 --> 45:53.760
at the Syrian border.

45:54.200 --> 45:56.362
- You're a good man, Joel.
- Yeah, I know.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.806
The convoy has been identified

45:58.880 --> 46:00.564
and is being tracked
by US military satellites.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.051
- You want a visual?
- 'Course I do.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.929
- Grace, visuals coming through.
- Yeah.

46:23.160 --> 46:26.289
Tabby, would you go and fetch
Jeds for me? Thank you.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.249
- Hi, Jed.
- Hi.

46:59.480 --> 47:00.891
Darling.

47:06.360 --> 47:08.169
You wanted to know what I do for a living.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.124
Three minutes to the border.

47:33.360 --> 47:34.407
Go get 'em.

47:36.160 --> 47:37.764
They're at the border, sir.

48:01.680 --> 48:04.604
Now. Come on. Look inside.

48:05.560 --> 48:07.210
I've got you.

48:12.560 --> 48:13.561
Hello.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.169
US troops at the border, sir.

48:19.400 --> 48:20.765
Demanding to open the trucks.

48:44.080 --> 48:46.242
You been practising
your magic tricks, Andrew?

49:32.120 --> 49:33.167
Well?

49:35.800 --> 49:36.881
Been let through.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.845
I should think so, too.

49:40.920 --> 49:41.967
They're delaying a convoy

49:42.040 --> 49:44.168
carrying much needed
agricultural equipment.

49:44.920 --> 49:46.968
It's an absolute scandal.

49:50.720 --> 49:53.724
You are a very bad man.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.729
They didn't watch the cups, you see.

50:03.840 --> 50:06.684
The convoy is on the move, sir.

50:06.760 --> 50:07.807
You are a genius!

50:12.840 --> 50:14.330
Thanks to my mascot.

50:15.240 --> 50:16.924
You should come to work more often.

50:18.520 --> 50:19.646
Where's Corky?

50:21.520 --> 50:22.646
Never mind about Corky.

50:24.760 --> 50:25.807
No, really, where is he?

50:27.840 --> 50:29.046
Stomach bug.

50:29.160 --> 50:30.400
He had to fly home.

50:53.200 --> 50:54.690
- What happened?
- What happened?

50:55.360 --> 50:57.203
I just licensed a full US military swoop

50:57.280 --> 50:59.567
on a bunch of combine harvesters,
that's what happened!

51:00.080 --> 51:01.127
I don't believe it.

51:01.640 --> 51:03.722
<i>Your intelligence was bullshit, Angela.</i>

51:03.800 --> 51:04.881
That's not possible.

51:04.960 --> 51:07.042
You never think your boy
could've been playing both sides?

51:07.120 --> 51:08.406
<i>You never once think of that?</i>

51:09.520 --> 51:10.931
You know what I think
your boy's doing right now?

51:11.000 --> 51:12.923
I think he's toasting one hell
of a piece of deception.

51:13.160 --> 51:15.240
And what if he's not?
What if Roper knows it was him?

51:15.400 --> 51:16.447
Yeah, well, good luck to him.

51:16.520 --> 51:17.720
Cos there's nothing we can do.

51:57.680 --> 51:58.727
Oh, my God.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.047
Oh, no.

52:05.320 --> 52:06.401
Gordon?

52:13.400 --> 52:14.731
Oh, my God!

52:15.440 --> 52:17.124
Oh, my God, Gordon.

52:18.120 --> 52:20.009
- Oh.
- I'm OK.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.006
Just a blow to the head.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.848
Just wait there, love, OK? Just don't move.

52:28.040 --> 52:30.122
Yeah, ambulance and police, please.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.884
10 Cranston Avenue.

52:32.040 --> 52:33.929
As quick as you can,
there's been a burglary.

52:35.160 --> 52:37.162
It's OK, someone's coming round,
they're coming.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.691
They're on the way.

52:39.760 --> 52:41.046
Oh, I'm so sorry.

52:41.800 --> 52:43.280
It's OK, someone's coming.

52:43.320 --> 52:44.367
I'm sorry.

53:00.880 --> 53:02.041
What's going on?

53:02.120 --> 53:03.281
We're clearing out.

53:04.600 --> 53:05.647
What happened here?

53:05.720 --> 53:08.041
Some local issue.
Had to be dealt with. Chief's orders.

53:08.440 --> 53:09.720
He doesn't like to leave traces.

53:10.760 --> 53:11.960
What do you mean "dealt with"?

53:14.600 --> 53:15.647
Souvenir for you.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.407
I think it's vintage.

53:29.960 --> 53:31.166
Andrew!

53:31.720 --> 53:33.688
Get your stuff together. Time to go.

53:42.320 --> 53:44.120
So have you worked out
how the trick was done?

53:45.240 --> 53:46.969
The arms were never here.

53:48.040 --> 53:50.168
Just enough
for the fireworks display,

53:50.240 --> 53:51.446
a little amuse-bouche.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.602
- But the main course...
- Never left Istanbul.

53:54.720 --> 53:56.449
You knew British enforcement
were on to you,

53:56.520 --> 53:58.045
so you changed the method of delivery.

53:58.120 --> 53:59.201
Left them on the boat.

53:59.880 --> 54:01.080
Now the Yanks have pulled out,

54:01.360 --> 54:02.771
Limpet is dead and buried.

54:05.800 --> 54:08.280
So Corky was my Judas.

54:09.600 --> 54:10.761
Who'd have thought it?

54:15.800 --> 54:17.000
Come on, get them out of here.

54:17.480 --> 54:19.005
Mr Hamid, please.

54:20.560 --> 54:23.803
Richard Onslow Roper. He will take my call.

54:26.080 --> 54:27.605
Freddie? It's Dickie.

54:27.960 --> 54:30.725
I am on my way with my business associate.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.047
See you soon.

54:33.640 --> 54:34.687
Who was that?

54:35.120 --> 54:36.167
Pal of mine.

54:36.840 --> 54:38.080
From Cairo.

55:07.360 --> 55:08.407
Where are we staying?

55:09.680 --> 55:11.808
Freddie's putting us up
in one of his places.

55:12.920 --> 55:14.729
Best in Cairo is what I hear.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.250
Cheer up, darling.

55:18.320 --> 55:19.731
We're on 'oliday.

56:16.360 --> 56:18.567
Time for a snooze amongst the pharaohs.

56:18.640 --> 56:20.608
- Downstairs for drinks later?
- Fabulous.
