01:31.090 --> 01:34.727
<i>Look, people disappear.
They lose time.</i>

01:34.761 --> 01:37.730
Planes crash that
are never recovered.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.401
Look, there's unexplained lights
in the sky

01:40.434 --> 01:42.802
and orbs floating
into campsites.

01:42.835 --> 01:46.473
<i>Believe that a clandestine
government study was conducted in the 1940s.</i>

01:46.507 --> 01:50.211
Exactly. It's like the
Bermuda Triangle of North America.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.314
I'm very serious.

01:55.915 --> 01:57.384
All the time. Everything.

01:57.418 --> 02:00.120
I assume this guy has zero
scientific credibility, right?

02:01.255 --> 02:03.723
He's a cryptolinguist.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.792
That sounds made up.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.762
I mean, you name
it, and it happens there.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.432
Yes.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.234
Yeah, it's just,
it's right in our backyard.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.135
We just gotta
get a crew up there.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.403
Yeah. All right.
We got it right here.

02:16.437 --> 02:19.273
So, uh, 12 years in the Navy,
codebreaker,

02:19.306 --> 02:21.375
doctorate in primate behavior.

02:21.408 --> 02:22.443
Who's that?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.445
That crypto-whatever the fuck.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.745
Cryptolinguist.

02:25.778 --> 02:28.881
Crypto-what-the-fuck-I-don't-
know-what-you're-talking-about.

02:28.915 --> 02:31.385
Now, you got to have Tom
re-record the opening intro.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.387
Call him a Navy vet,
call him a scientist.

02:33.420 --> 02:36.190
Put "Doctor" in front of his name
in that opening graphic thing.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.158
Make his credentials sound like
they're fucking real.

02:40.927 --> 02:43.197
<i>It is a place of legends.</i>

02:43.230 --> 02:46.533
Bigfoot. Right.
Yeah. That's the angle.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.403
But, look, we have
accounts going back

02:49.436 --> 02:53.474
hundreds of years. There's
folklore, indigenous accounts.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.175
It's not just the creatures.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.544
<i>On this episode of</i> Truth
Stalkers...

02:57.578 --> 02:59.179
I mean,
how would they even know?

02:59.213 --> 03:02.283
Nobody has ever been out there
to take a look.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.285
Go back to the clip.
How long is that, 10 seconds?

03:04.318 --> 03:06.886
<i>Audio recordings of
a mysterious animal.</i>

03:06.919 --> 03:08.555
That... we can make that work.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.090
<i>...be a hotspot
of paranormal activity.</i>

03:11.125 --> 03:13.092
Do you want real local
or plays local?

03:13.127 --> 03:15.028
Oh, fuck. Casting...

03:15.061 --> 03:17.897
That, that's all we're asking.
Wonderful. I will see you soon.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.233
We can use that scream, right?

03:19.266 --> 03:21.302
All right.
They'll be here in 20 minutes.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.103
<i>That's the old Chisolm
Trail that goes right behind the...</i>

03:23.137 --> 03:25.306
Look, I think
I got something here.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.909
I see nothing.

03:29.942 --> 03:31.345
Give it a second.

03:38.017 --> 03:41.188
- Bam. Right there.
- That's good enough.

03:41.221 --> 03:45.058
Are you kidding me? Some asshole
in a gorilla suit in the woods?

03:45.091 --> 03:46.593
- It's a placeholder for now.
- Are you kidding me?

03:46.627 --> 03:49.396
No, no. I need to sell that
placeholder, remember?

03:50.364 --> 03:52.098
This is, this is...

03:53.367 --> 03:55.502
What is this? I mean,
is it even from the area?

03:55.536 --> 03:57.204
Do we know anything about it?

03:57.237 --> 04:00.341
Look, can't you just sell this,
so that we can actually go?

04:00.374 --> 04:02.343
Make something out of nothing,
right?

04:10.651 --> 04:12.018
Put it in the edit.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.524
Put the scream
over the last frame.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.462
Here.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.398
Okay. Um, okay,

04:24.431 --> 04:25.998
now do the zoom thing.

04:27.534 --> 04:30.970
Zoom and scream happen
at the same time, okay?

04:32.939 --> 04:35.007
Okay. Run it through,
just the end.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.852
Why do I see nothing
on my screen right now?

04:46.153 --> 04:48.689
Thank you.

04:48.722 --> 04:54.528
<i>The sound you hear is what some
experts believe to be an actual Bigfoot yell.</i>

04:55.696 --> 04:58.432
<i>Recorded near the Brandon Diner
in 1974,</i>

04:58.465 --> 05:04.405
<i>it is regarded as the most authentic audio
recording of the creature ever captured.</i>

06:06.366 --> 06:09.603
<i>Growing up in the area,
we used to hear about some of the</i>

06:09.636 --> 06:12.038
<i>folklore. We used to
hear some stories of...</i>

06:17.511 --> 06:23.217
When I was a kid, my dad, he was
interested in, in nature and,

06:23.250 --> 06:28.755
and the magic of the nature,
things that were invisible to most.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.257
And I was...

06:47.674 --> 06:50.577
I never had any paranormal
experiences or anything,

06:50.611 --> 06:54.381
- but it was an area that everyone knew about.
- <i>It's been eight hours.</i>

06:54.414 --> 06:58.452
Not like I ever had
an experience or anything.

06:58.485 --> 07:01.053
I mean, it's not like
I ever saw a ghost.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.123
- His ass is fired.
- But I guess I...

07:04.090 --> 07:05.526
Make some coffee.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.428
I'd, um, I'd try to get to
school early.

07:08.462 --> 07:11.131
- Going back to about third grade I would...
- Are they still casting?

07:11.164 --> 07:14.201
I'd pray my bus was
even 15 minutes early,

07:14.234 --> 07:15.335
- so I could...
- Posters.

07:15.369 --> 07:19.273
...you know, go up to
the school library and I'd...

07:19.306 --> 07:22.074
- I think it's gonna make it.
- Just pick it up where you were.

07:22.109 --> 07:26.146
- I am so fucking hot.
- I'd go to the library,

07:26.179 --> 07:29.149
um, the school library.

07:29.182 --> 07:33.085
And I'd, I'd find the same book
every day,

07:33.120 --> 07:34.855
and I'd read the same parts.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.291
- And it was this book called...
- I think it's gonna make it.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.226
<i>...Monsters, Myths,
and Legends.</i>

07:39.259 --> 07:41.828
And it had this, this yellow
cover with this

07:41.862 --> 07:45.165
dark cartoony monster
peering over the title.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.568
- And, um...
- Are they still fucking casting?

07:47.601 --> 07:49.570
I was totally obsessed.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.573
I'm sure, you know, it seems
childish now, but I've been

07:52.606 --> 07:53.640
looking for it lately.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.776
How long you been
letting each of 'em talk?

07:57.678 --> 07:58.779
Just keep going.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.747
No. Actually don't.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.617
Watch and learn, people.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.753
Shh!

08:08.155 --> 08:09.156
Shh.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.659
Okay.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.462
Nina Noon.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.198
Nina, Nina, Nina Noon.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.800
So tell me, why did you show up
here today?

08:21.802 --> 08:24.738
I subscribe to, uh,
a list feed that...

08:24.771 --> 08:28.141
No, no, no, no.
Why you should go with us?

08:28.642 --> 08:30.644
Hmm, uh...

08:30.677 --> 08:32.546
Just say what you're thinking.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.616
Well, I've always been
a big fan of your show,

08:35.649 --> 08:37.484
and I think it's, you know,

08:37.517 --> 08:39.653
really cool to
have proof that...

08:40.520 --> 08:42.356
Of what?

08:42.389 --> 08:45.425
To discover something, you know,
to actually find something that...

08:45.459 --> 08:47.494
I know exactly
what you're talking about,

08:47.527 --> 08:50.797
UFOs and Loch Ness monsters and

08:52.199 --> 08:55.502
spirits of
our dead fathers, hmm?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.739
Sweetheart, you're,
you're not right for the part,

08:59.439 --> 09:00.440
okay?

09:01.408 --> 09:02.609
We're looking for real.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.847
All right. Okay.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.849
Uh, let's make a decision here.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.884
I got an early start tomorrow
and I wanna get home.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.286
Asshole.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.555
What was that?

09:16.690 --> 09:18.792
She just call me an asshole?

09:18.825 --> 09:21.528
She just called me an asshole.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.330
<i>You can say it out loud, sweetheart.</i>

09:32.906 --> 09:37.477
Kindly lower
that left knee to use the mat.

09:37.511 --> 09:41.882
And now the hips,
let the hand step to that right side.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.718
You can stay right here
and reach the arms high.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.194
Soft gaze for two.

10:03.737 --> 10:08.442
"How surely gravity's law,
strong as an ocean current,

10:08.475 --> 10:11.344
<i>"takes hold of even
the strongest thing</i>

10:11.378 --> 10:14.781
<i>"and pulls it toward
the heart of the world.</i>

10:14.815 --> 10:21.588
"Each thing, each stone,
blossom, child is held in place.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.758
<i>"Only we, in our arrogance,
push out beyond</i>

10:24.791 --> 10:28.328
<i>"what we belong to
for some empty freedom.</i>

10:28.361 --> 10:33.734
<i>"If we surrender to Earth's intelligence,
we could rise up rooted like trees."</i>

10:35.769 --> 10:39.906
<i>"Instead, we entangle
ourselves in knots of our own making</i>

10:39.940 --> 10:43.477
<i>"and struggle,
lonely and confused.</i>

10:43.510 --> 10:48.548
<i>"So, like children,
we begin again to learn from the things."</i>

10:48.582 --> 10:52.686
Listen, I was just, um,
writing you. We need to talk.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.955
<i>Nina? Wait.
They like you.</i>

10:54.988 --> 10:56.289
Who does?

10:56.323 --> 11:00.694
<i>"This is what
the things teach us. To fall,</i>

11:00.727 --> 11:03.764
<i>"patiently trusting
our heaviness.</i>

11:03.797 --> 11:07.701
<i>"Even a bird has to do that
before it can fly."</i>

11:09.402 --> 11:11.972
This isn't why
I moved out here.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.642
Reality shows and auditioning for assholes.
It's just...

11:15.675 --> 11:21.848
<i>Okay. No. Now wait. Listen, if you
don't wanna take it, someone else will.</i>

11:21.882 --> 11:26.353
<i>They're waiting on an answer.
What's it gonna be, Nina?</i>

12:01.588 --> 12:03.590
<i>♪ Truth Stalkers ♪</i>

12:07.494 --> 12:09.095
<i>♪ We stalk the truth ♪</i>

12:09.130 --> 12:10.831
- All right.
- <i>♪ We stalk the truth ♪</i>

12:10.864 --> 12:12.465
Okay.
Give it a rest, man.

12:16.170 --> 12:18.438
You love it, Rochelle.
You love it.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.373
Oh, no. Listen to the radio.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.975
Nope. You're stuck with me.

12:22.008 --> 12:24.845
You fly them
around in the space,

12:24.878 --> 12:26.847
so you can always see him,
even when you've driven off.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.584
Truth Stalkers!

12:30.617 --> 12:32.752
In other words, don't loose
the other vans, Roch.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.988
It's a straight shot.
They're gonna be fine.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.990
Here. I made
a couple playlists.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.859
- Oh, thank you, God.
- Oh, thank God.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.460
Password's Eric.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.695
Oh, that's clever.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.763
Clever
enough to bring some music.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.032
Ow!

12:46.066 --> 12:48.068
Eric, how's the gear?

12:48.102 --> 12:51.172
It's solid. But, again,
not what I'm used to.

12:51.205 --> 12:54.007
And not what
we're used to, either.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.144
Look, we really appreciate
you taking over last minute and all.

12:57.178 --> 12:59.113
Yeah, no doubt.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.820
Are you gonna play it?

13:06.853 --> 13:09.022
This soundtrack's
as old as you, Rochelle.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.991
Hilarious.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.114
You miss it?

13:33.147 --> 13:34.781
Huh?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.984
Where you're from?
You miss home?

13:38.018 --> 13:40.086
I can barely remember.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.490
I haven't been back in years.

13:45.226 --> 13:47.894
Kind of like to think
I'm not from here anymore.

13:51.265 --> 13:52.465
I can see why.

15:47.415 --> 15:49.350
<i>Thunderstorms
over the next few hours.</i>

15:49.383 --> 15:51.017
<i>Cloudy tomorrow...</i>

15:52.286 --> 15:54.621
<i>In the news today...</i>

15:58.958 --> 15:59.959
Nothing.

16:03.897 --> 16:06.566
Roch-y, Roch-y, Roch.

16:09.170 --> 16:10.937
So just to keep track.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.373
Don't.

16:12.406 --> 16:17.043
Lost vans, half a crew,
and now no guide.

16:18.379 --> 16:19.946
I've done lots of shows.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.849
Relax, dude.
We read your resume.

16:29.256 --> 16:33.227
It's not a good sign, you know,
guide getting lost.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.728
He'll be here. He's a local.

16:37.931 --> 16:41.701
Are any of you our guide?

16:41.734 --> 16:44.704
Uh, super easy. Uh, you just,
uh, you show up late,

16:44.737 --> 16:47.974
uh, maybe not at all, maybe get
lost, lie drunk in a ditch someplace.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.176
Would you shut up?

16:50.277 --> 16:52.645
You're gonna get
our asses kicked.

16:57.151 --> 16:58.885
Do you ever think
that this is your audience?

16:59.320 --> 17:01.988
I try not to.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.023
No, but these are the people
that actually watch your show.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.294
Average people.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.064
This is who you do it for.

17:11.097 --> 17:15.102
You drive seven hours. You wade through
swamps. You scare yourself silly.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.938
Reality.

17:19.607 --> 17:22.742
This is reality. Not what we do.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.713
No one would wanna
watch the real thing anyway.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.217
It's too much

17:30.251 --> 17:33.887
<i>and too boring,
all at the same time.</i>

17:37.324 --> 17:38.858
Who would care?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.299
Just think,

17:45.332 --> 17:48.835
all we really wanted
was somebody to run "C" cam.

17:53.006 --> 17:54.741
I'd settle for the bill,
actually.

17:56.743 --> 18:00.414
This has been a joy,
but we're ready to leave now.

18:04.385 --> 18:06.353
Okay. I tried. Let's go.

18:06.387 --> 18:09.055
Can't we just leave some money?

18:09.088 --> 18:12.025
I would love to, but,
uh, I don't have a bill.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.128
You can't figure out the math?

18:19.133 --> 18:21.834
Didn't take long for the hometown
girl to go local, did it?

18:24.271 --> 18:25.872
Maybe she's just being decent.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.974
Tell her to be decent
when the camera's rolling.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.379
Where's your sense
of humor, Nina?

19:09.283 --> 19:12.018
Eric, need you a sec.

19:14.321 --> 19:17.890
Wanna do a little intro
with some "We're just arrived,"

19:17.924 --> 19:21.395
talk about some recent activity,
Bigfoot, people vanishing.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.530
- Let's get the restaurant.
- Seriously, Rochelle. What's the point?

19:23.564 --> 19:26.899
Wait for the real crew.
This is gonna look like shit.

19:29.570 --> 19:32.206
I got half a mind to
just pack up and go.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.308
And just waste the fact
that we're here? Nice.

19:41.315 --> 19:45.885
<i>Growing up in the area, we used
to hear about some of the folklore,</i>

19:45.918 --> 19:48.355
<i>we used to hear some stories of...</i>

19:48.389 --> 19:49.956
<i>Say that again,
just a little louder.</i>

19:49.989 --> 19:52.459
- Say what again?
- Um, anything you want.

19:53.594 --> 19:55.094
I don't know what...

19:55.129 --> 19:57.096
Uh, just tell me
about this place.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.070
<i>My dad, he, um...</i>

20:04.104 --> 20:06.106
Yeah. Your dad?
Tell me about him.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.443
Yeah.

20:09.476 --> 20:15.482
<i>When I was a kid, my dad,
he was interested in nature and...</i>

20:15.516 --> 20:16.916
<i>Louder.</i>

20:16.949 --> 20:23.324
<i>He was interested in
nature, in the magic of nature,</i>

20:23.357 --> 20:26.193
<i>things that were
invisible to most.</i>

20:26.226 --> 20:27.994
That's better.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.197
I'm gonna go get
a couple shots over here.

20:30.230 --> 20:33.267
It's not the first time, that's for
sure. I think they'd appreciate the honesty.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.369
Yeah. "How did you
spend our money?"

20:35.402 --> 20:38.505
"Oh, we just took a little road trip,
and then spent a night in a hotel."

20:38.539 --> 20:41.141
Check your phone again.

20:41.175 --> 20:43.910
Fine.
I'm just trying to be productive.

21:53.213 --> 21:55.948
I am not afraid to tell them
exactly what I think, and you know that.

21:55.982 --> 21:59.620
Of course you're not,
because you never get blamed for anything.

21:59.653 --> 22:03.055
I mean, it's easy for you to just
shrug your shoulders and laugh it off.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.491
- Is this about the poster?
- Oh, my God.

22:04.525 --> 22:05.559
This is about the poster.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.561
Seriously?
I hope you're kidding.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.263
- Oh, I hope you're kidding.
- And you're fucking...

22:09.996 --> 22:11.632
Jeremy, let it go.

22:11.665 --> 22:15.067
I'd love to let it go, back in the van,
as far as from here as possible, in fact.

22:15.102 --> 22:17.571
If you only had it in you.

22:17.604 --> 22:18.605
Give me the keys.

22:21.375 --> 22:23.444
Do it, please.

22:23.477 --> 22:26.747
Because this whole thing,
it works without you.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.115
Guys, hang on.

22:30.250 --> 22:31.485
Let me guess.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.719
We're late.

22:32.753 --> 22:35.054
Yeah, we're late.

22:35.087 --> 22:38.392
Okay. Hold it
a second there, Guide.

22:38.425 --> 22:39.793
We're waiting for
the rest of our crew

22:39.827 --> 22:42.061
because somebody drove a little
fast and lost the rest of the vans.

22:44.531 --> 22:48.302
There's a clearing not far in. Let's get
moving, so we make it back before dark.

22:50.103 --> 22:51.605
Great.

22:51.638 --> 22:54.508
Okay. Let's pack it up, people,
before one of us loses his freaking mind.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.076
We'll find a hotel.
We'll start again tomorrow morning.

22:57.110 --> 22:59.279
Uh, get our stuff back
from the mountain man.

22:59.313 --> 23:01.548
This is good. This is good.

23:01.582 --> 23:04.384
Huh. I'm not needed, right?
So you go do your thing.

23:04.418 --> 23:06.253
You get whatever it is
you think this is all about...

23:06.286 --> 23:07.654
Mmm-hmm.
- ...everybody shows up, I'll find you.

23:07.688 --> 23:10.089
- Yeah.
- You won't find us.

23:10.123 --> 23:11.725
Yeah? I've been
in the woods before.

23:13.727 --> 23:14.728
Not here.

23:22.269 --> 23:24.137
Please tell me
you've been recording this?

23:24.171 --> 23:25.305
Oh, hell yeah.

23:26.273 --> 23:27.274
Good.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.506
Hey, can you...

24:34.207 --> 24:36.476
The team has fallen behind.
Can you slow down?

24:49.623 --> 24:51.124
You okay?

24:51.158 --> 24:53.126
- Yeah.
- Better keep up.

26:23.884 --> 26:25.585
Well, that sucked.

26:25.619 --> 26:26.787
We made it safely.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.556
Where?

26:29.589 --> 26:31.858
A safe place for now.
You can begin here.

26:33.493 --> 26:34.861
- Here.
- Okay.

26:48.508 --> 26:49.743
For your team's arrival.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.363
An offering to the land.

27:31.651 --> 27:32.652
Jesus.

27:36.389 --> 27:37.958
Hey, guys.

27:39.793 --> 27:41.928
Come on, let's get to work,
I found something.

27:59.579 --> 28:01.615
See? Right there.

28:03.450 --> 28:04.818
Man, that is freaky.

28:05.685 --> 28:06.686
Do you hear anything?

28:07.420 --> 28:08.522
Nothing.

28:08.555 --> 28:09.689
Okay, cut.

28:11.958 --> 28:13.794
You got to think on your feet
here now, okay?

28:13.827 --> 28:15.061
You heard knocking
in the distance,

28:15.095 --> 28:17.931
or you saw a large,
shadowy figure run through the woods,

28:17.964 --> 28:20.300
or you smelled a foul odor.
You read the packet, right?

28:21.101 --> 28:22.302
Nina?

28:23.137 --> 28:26.640
Make it good. Okay?
Acting. Drama.

28:28.142 --> 28:29.743
Places. Let's go again.

28:31.578 --> 28:33.747
- Camera's rolling.
- And action.

28:35.849 --> 28:37.317
Guys, over here.

28:37.350 --> 28:40.420
- What's going on?
- I was setting up a trail cam on that tree right there,

28:40.453 --> 28:44.424
and I heard something. Something big
just, just crashing through the brush,

28:44.457 --> 28:47.727
and it was gone so fast, I don't know what
I saw, but I know that I saw something.

28:47.761 --> 28:50.030
Something is out there.

28:50.063 --> 28:52.365
Okay, good.
I like that.

28:53.134 --> 28:54.168
Let's do it again.

28:54.202 --> 28:57.704
- Camera's rolling.
- And action, Nina.

28:57.737 --> 29:00.040
- Hear us.
- Guys. Guys, over here.

29:00.073 --> 29:01.875
- What's going on?
- I was setting up a trail cam...

29:01.908 --> 29:04.878
Make our hands
respect the things you've made,

29:04.911 --> 29:07.480
and make our ears sharp
to hear your voice.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.586
It's not on the list.

29:12.619 --> 29:15.021
Fuck the list, we need another
segment to make it connect.

29:16.823 --> 29:19.160
Whoa. Whoa,
what do you think you're doing?

29:19.193 --> 29:20.994
We just need
a few shots in a denser area.

29:21.027 --> 29:23.363
No, no, no,
just wait, just wait.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.834
You need to stay
in the clearing.

29:32.206 --> 29:37.043
Dude, the camera's not rolling, so you
can drop it for a second, all right?

29:37.077 --> 29:40.881
We love the clearing, it's fantastic, but we
need more and we don't have a lot of time.

29:40.914 --> 29:45.085
All right. I'll find you a spot,
a great spot, just stay here.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.687
I'll secure another place.

29:48.555 --> 29:50.557
Great. Secure it.

29:52.092 --> 29:53.093
Thank you.

29:59.532 --> 30:00.700
Good job.

30:02.936 --> 30:04.070
Let's go.

30:04.105 --> 30:05.772
- Just wait.
- No, now you wanna wait.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.507
We need more.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.176
That's fine. You stay here.
I don't care.

30:09.210 --> 30:10.543
Nina, you want to join me?

30:11.611 --> 30:13.114
Shouldn't we wait
for the guide?

30:13.147 --> 30:14.547
You afraid of the guide?

30:15.116 --> 30:16.816
I can go with.

30:16.850 --> 30:18.618
We're good.
Rochelle needs your help.

30:19.686 --> 30:21.521
You and camera guy
do your intro.

30:21.554 --> 30:23.124
Talk about all the amazing
shit we've seen here.

30:26.826 --> 30:27.961
All right.

30:29.095 --> 30:32.065
Watch your step.
Pay attention.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.868
Here, keep it on.

30:34.901 --> 30:35.969
Yes, ma'am.

30:36.836 --> 30:37.871
Let's go.

30:59.793 --> 31:00.860
Circus, isn't it?

31:01.628 --> 31:02.629
I guess.

31:04.298 --> 31:05.966
Ah, you hope for something
long enough,

31:05.999 --> 31:07.867
you start to believe in
all kinds of weird shit.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.771
Just to justify
what you're doing, yeah?

31:16.743 --> 31:18.044
Look at Rochelle.

31:21.014 --> 31:24.084
Whatever she was looking for
passed her by a long time ago.

31:26.220 --> 31:28.122
So, right over there,

31:28.155 --> 31:30.257
that's where Nina
saw the marks.

31:30.291 --> 31:33.260
We're about to try
a call and response.

31:33.294 --> 31:35.129
Based on numerous
eyewitness reports,

31:35.162 --> 31:37.931
we believe that Sasquatch
uses a large branch

31:37.964 --> 31:40.600
to strike trees
as a way to call out to others.

31:40.633 --> 31:43.770
Perhaps as a signal,
or even as a warning.

31:43.803 --> 31:49.609
So I am going
to emulate those sounds

31:49.642 --> 31:53.013
and we'll see if
whatever else is out here

31:53.046 --> 31:55.048
wants to join
in the conversation.

31:56.417 --> 31:59.186
Jeremy for Rochelle.
We're about to initiate the tree knocks.

31:59.220 --> 32:01.222
<i>Check.
All quiet here.</i>

32:01.255 --> 32:02.889
I'm gonna do three knocks,

32:02.922 --> 32:04.824
wait, then three knocks more.

32:05.226 --> 32:06.260
<i>Check.</i>

32:10.331 --> 32:11.831
Here goes nothing.

32:32.085 --> 32:33.220
I'm going again.

32:59.746 --> 33:01.248
Nice improv back there,
by the way.

33:01.515 --> 33:02.749
Thanks.

33:05.018 --> 33:06.320
How long you been in LA?

33:07.254 --> 33:08.688
Coming on four years.

33:08.721 --> 33:09.856
Yeah? Treating you good?

33:10.424 --> 33:11.658
It's okay.

33:16.330 --> 33:18.365
Shitty, actually.

33:18.399 --> 33:22.203
Yeah, I would have thought there'd be
plenty of work for somebody like you.

33:23.137 --> 33:25.638
Yeah, a few web series.

33:25.672 --> 33:26.706
Yeah. You know
what's gonna happen?

33:26.739 --> 33:28.641
You're gonna, you're gonna
probably get impatient

33:28.675 --> 33:31.878
and, uh, assert yourself more.

33:31.911 --> 33:33.012
Get aggressive.

33:34.281 --> 33:35.615
That's how it happened for me.

33:37.418 --> 33:38.852
You're an actor?

33:38.885 --> 33:41.855
No, uh, worse actually,
I was a writer.

33:41.888 --> 33:44.724
Uh, yeah.

33:44.757 --> 33:48.395
I, uh, I almost
had a few things made.

33:48.429 --> 33:49.696
Had an agent.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.299
Never really went
anywhere, though.

33:53.900 --> 33:55.935
I was working part-time
at a production company

33:55.969 --> 33:58.738
and, um, I just kind of
stumbled into this.

33:58.771 --> 34:03.643
And just kind of made it up
for myself with Rochelle.

34:05.446 --> 34:06.580
I just couldn't wait
around anymore, you know?

34:06.614 --> 34:09.315
I had to...
make something happen.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.319
It's different for us,
you know.

34:12.353 --> 34:16.755
There's no normal path
to success.

34:16.789 --> 34:19.859
You know, everybody out there,
they're trying to be the next famous...

34:21.928 --> 34:23.062
whatever.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.701
<i>Rochelle for Jeremy.</i>

34:28.735 --> 34:30.904
- Yeah.
- <i>Update, please.</i>

34:30.937 --> 34:32.672
Lot of trees,
believe it or not.

34:33.973 --> 34:35.376
<i>Keep me posted.</i>

34:35.409 --> 34:37.444
<i>Getting nervous back here.</i>

34:37.478 --> 34:40.414
Well, Bigfoot tried to grab me, but I
told him he didn't exist, so he ran away.

34:41.482 --> 34:42.982
<i>Don't be an ass.</i>

34:43.016 --> 34:44.918
<i>I want to get out of here
before dark. Okay?</i>

34:44.951 --> 34:46.753
Oop! Oh, did I just do that?

34:50.089 --> 34:51.757
Yeah, we should
shoot something.

34:53.494 --> 34:55.862
You know, before we do,
though, I think, um,

34:57.364 --> 35:00.066
maybe we should
grab a drink sometime

35:00.099 --> 35:02.936
when we're back in LA,
talk shop.

35:02.969 --> 35:04.938
I know a lot of people.
I bet I could help.

35:04.971 --> 35:07.974
Yeah. We could, you know,
get the whole crew together.

35:08.775 --> 35:09.776
That'd be fun.

35:12.845 --> 35:13.980
Right.

35:17.518 --> 35:20.154
Rochelle for Jeremy.

35:24.158 --> 35:25.858
Rochelle for Jeremy.

35:30.264 --> 35:33.066
Wait here. I'm gonna
have to go find them.

35:41.475 --> 35:42.476
Great.

35:45.078 --> 35:46.413
Let's do another
segment up here.

35:48.915 --> 35:50.217
Jeremy for Rochelle?

35:52.152 --> 35:53.487
- Nothing.
- Did you feel that?

35:57.957 --> 36:00.760
Over here? You stay here.
I'm gonna check out our spot.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.321
Jeremy?

36:43.370 --> 36:44.371
Jeremy?

37:50.437 --> 37:52.139
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:52.172 --> 37:54.141
<i>And your
dad, tell me about him.</i>

37:56.543 --> 37:57.611
What the hell?

38:09.189 --> 38:10.457
It was
the weirdest thing.

38:13.025 --> 38:16.497
I was walking. And Jeremy,
he went one way. And...

38:19.166 --> 38:21.335
Where's Rochelle?

38:21.368 --> 38:23.170
- Looking for you.
- Shit!

38:23.637 --> 38:24.971
Rochelle!

38:30.511 --> 38:31.578
Rochelle!

38:39.620 --> 38:40.654
Hey!

38:42.523 --> 38:43.590
Wait!

39:22.162 --> 39:23.230
Jeremy for Rochelle.

39:28.635 --> 39:29.969
Nina!

39:34.374 --> 39:35.375
Nina!

39:40.647 --> 39:41.648
Nina?

39:52.793 --> 39:54.994
Hey!

39:57.564 --> 39:59.666
I'm fine, by the way.
No need to worry about me.

40:04.805 --> 40:08.275
Rochelle, you're not
gonna believe this.

40:10.277 --> 40:13.045
You never get
blamed for anything. Ever.

40:13.079 --> 40:14.681
It's easy for you
to just laugh it off...

40:15.349 --> 40:17.117
Rochelle?

40:17.150 --> 40:18.318
Is this about the poster?
It's about posters, isn't it?

40:18.352 --> 40:19.653
Oh, I hope you're kidding.

40:19.686 --> 40:22.155
Jeremy? Seriously, let it go.

40:22.189 --> 40:23.524
I'd love
to let it go.

40:23.557 --> 40:26.025
In the van,
as far from here as possible.

40:30.330 --> 40:31.565
- Yeah!
- Really?

40:32.466 --> 40:34.301
Do it, please.

40:35.836 --> 40:37.036
What the fuck?

40:39.306 --> 40:42.074
<i>Let's go.
We don't have time.</i>

40:42.109 --> 40:44.611
We can't stay here.
We don't have time.

40:52.319 --> 40:53.353
Jeremy?

40:53.887 --> 40:55.188
Let's go.

40:56.323 --> 40:57.391
We need to gather the others.

41:21.682 --> 41:25.319
Everything in nature,
even us,

41:25.352 --> 41:29.323
<i>has medicine,
some people call it.</i>

41:29.356 --> 41:32.793
<i>It's, um, something
that's good for everyone.</i>

41:32.826 --> 41:35.662
<i>It's a being's
gift to the world.</i>

41:38.365 --> 41:39.499
<i>Even this.</i>

41:41.234 --> 41:44.438
<i>Looks sad, painful for us.</i>

41:46.406 --> 41:47.774
<i>It's passed on,</i>

41:49.309 --> 41:53.246
<i>but the passing, too,
can be a gift.</i>

41:53.280 --> 41:55.782
<i>Sometimes, it can be
a being's greatest gift.</i>

41:57.651 --> 42:01.755
<i>And it means something
that you found it.</i>

42:01.788 --> 42:04.191
<i>It's sharing
its medicine with you.</i>

42:08.695 --> 42:11.565
Can I give it
something too?

42:12.432 --> 42:14.635
Mmm-hmm. A little prayer.

42:14.668 --> 42:16.903
Or you could write
something to it.

42:16.937 --> 42:19.272
Or you can
make it something.

42:19.806 --> 42:21.541
A drawing.

42:24.678 --> 42:26.346
Close your eyes.

42:26.680 --> 42:27.914
Good.

42:27.948 --> 42:29.416
Connect here.

42:33.286 --> 42:35.522
When you interact this way,

42:35.555 --> 42:37.524
nature will come closer,

42:37.557 --> 42:38.692
and it'll teach you things.

42:39.860 --> 42:41.428
- You'll see more...
- <i>Nina!</i>

42:42.829 --> 42:44.364
<i>Things others can't.</i>

42:49.970 --> 42:51.438
Thought
I could see him.

42:54.975 --> 42:58.345
He'll be back, right?

42:58.979 --> 43:00.580
Doubt Jeremy got too far.

43:09.322 --> 43:10.323
No, thanks.

43:14.594 --> 43:16.596
Just save me some
for when I panic.

43:24.337 --> 43:25.472
Guess I already did, huh?

43:25.939 --> 43:28.375
No, I get it.

43:29.643 --> 43:32.345
The same thing
happened to me.

43:32.379 --> 43:34.614
Back by the edge of the woods,
by the diner.

43:35.348 --> 43:36.883
- Really?
- Mmm.

43:37.884 --> 43:39.753
I saw something weird

43:39.786 --> 43:42.289
and my mind
ran away with it.

43:45.025 --> 43:48.328
And for just an instant,

43:48.361 --> 43:51.531
I thought that there might actually
be something about this place.

43:55.035 --> 43:56.703
Is that what
you were hoping for?

43:59.039 --> 44:01.374
No, not really.

44:03.376 --> 44:06.680
But it does
remind me of this time

44:06.713 --> 44:08.448
I was at my friend's cabin.

44:09.449 --> 44:12.819
We were all sleeping
on couches and the floor.

44:12.853 --> 44:14.921
I used to always wear
these headphones, you know,

44:14.955 --> 44:16.556
to help me get
to sleep, right?

44:16.590 --> 44:18.658
So I wouldn't have
to hear all the snoring.

44:19.526 --> 44:21.628
And I woke up,

44:21.661 --> 44:23.530
and we'd all been drinking.

44:23.563 --> 44:26.566
And I went outside,
you know, half asleep,

44:26.600 --> 44:28.068
a little buzzed,

44:28.101 --> 44:30.804
- to, um, uh, relieve...
- Take a piss?

44:30.837 --> 44:33.039
Yeah. Yeah.

44:33.073 --> 44:36.543
So I'm pissing in the woods,
and I'm listening to music,

44:37.410 --> 44:38.678
and I hear something.

44:40.847 --> 44:42.716
My name.

44:42.749 --> 44:44.551
Kind of quiet,
through the music.

44:45.819 --> 44:49.823
And I look back,
and there's nothing.

44:50.824 --> 44:52.559
So I go back to my business,

44:53.360 --> 44:57.531
and I hear it again,
and I look back.

44:57.564 --> 45:00.600
And this time,
out of the darkness

45:01.101 --> 45:03.470
comes this thing,

45:03.503 --> 45:07.741
like a white sheet,
floating like a ghost,

45:08.441 --> 45:09.609
calling my name.

45:11.578 --> 45:14.548
And I just about
have a heart attack.

45:14.581 --> 45:19.352
But it takes one more step,
and it's fully in the light.

45:19.386 --> 45:24.090
And I see my friend with all of
his bedding, stumbling around,

45:24.125 --> 45:26.993
drunk off his ass,
looking for a place to sleep.

45:30.997 --> 45:33.700
You know, the interesting thing
is, though, is that I always

45:33.733 --> 45:36.570
wish that I'd seen
a ghost or something.

45:36.603 --> 45:39.106
You know?
I prayed for it.

45:39.140 --> 45:41.341
Really, like, every night.

45:42.876 --> 45:44.511
But when I actually
thought I did,

45:45.279 --> 45:46.880
and it was right
in front of me,

45:48.815 --> 45:50.016
I took it all back,

45:52.153 --> 45:54.020
and I didn't want
to see a ghost at all.

45:56.690 --> 45:58.358
I just wanted to be home.

46:04.898 --> 46:06.733
Took you long enough.
We need to get moving.

46:06.766 --> 46:09.870
- Get your things.
- You guys okay?

46:09.903 --> 46:12.839
I told you not to leave.
I told you to respect this place.

46:14.074 --> 46:16.776
- It's not safe here.
- Then take us back.

46:16.810 --> 46:18.179
What do you think
I'm doing?

46:18.212 --> 46:20.747
That way. That's the way
we came in.

46:20.780 --> 46:23.416
You might think you know your way back.
You don't.

46:27.188 --> 46:29.856
It responds. All this.

46:30.824 --> 46:32.692
To us.

46:32.726 --> 46:35.129
It changes and makes
new connections, always.

46:35.929 --> 46:38.098
Every minute we're here.

46:38.132 --> 46:42.002
Giving us just what we need.
Whatever we're afraid to see.

46:46.940 --> 46:48.441
Get up.

46:50.144 --> 46:51.145
Move!

46:52.078 --> 46:53.114
Let's go!

47:47.934 --> 47:49.069
Nina!

47:51.671 --> 47:53.006
Nina!

48:08.021 --> 48:09.089
Eric!

48:28.309 --> 48:31.245
<i>Those prayers won't help.
They're not real.</i>

48:33.847 --> 48:35.982
<i>Look at where
they've led you.</i>

48:47.827 --> 48:49.529
- How much further?
- We're close.

49:08.149 --> 49:09.283
It's a warning.

49:11.885 --> 49:12.886
Come on.

49:20.960 --> 49:22.695
It's, it's just an animal.

49:26.866 --> 49:27.867
Come on.

50:41.108 --> 50:44.245
We're close.

50:47.780 --> 50:50.251
Come on.

50:51.318 --> 50:52.685
Oh, my God.

51:56.450 --> 51:59.186
Be grateful you don't
have to see what I do.

52:08.462 --> 52:10.063
We'll
set up for the night.

52:13.133 --> 52:16.769
We'll find our way out
in the morning, on our own.

52:27.013 --> 52:30.184
The way out
is not the way in.

52:30.217 --> 52:36.055
I was checking.
There was no hill.

52:36.089 --> 52:38.425
- This isn't the same place.
- Sure it is.

52:40.026 --> 52:42.895
It's just darker.

52:45.466 --> 52:48.034
Nice work, you little
hopped up piece of shit.

52:49.436 --> 52:50.504
Thanks a lot.

53:12.058 --> 53:14.927
Every path unfolded
to the stars.

53:22.336 --> 53:24.971
Impossible constellation.

53:26.607 --> 53:29.075
Break through
the sheet of clouds.

53:30.544 --> 53:32.346
- What do you see?
- Until the star.

53:35.416 --> 53:37.351
Hey, can you stay awake?

53:38.352 --> 53:39.486
Talk to me.

53:47.528 --> 53:48.828
What do you see?

53:54.967 --> 53:56.170
<i>What? Um...</i>

53:58.439 --> 54:01.342
<i>I can't
think of anything.</i>

54:01.375 --> 54:03.610
<i>A little louder.</i>

54:03.644 --> 54:06.513
<i>Um, maybe, uh, tell me
about this place.</i>

54:09.550 --> 54:11.050
<i>How was it
growing up here?</i>

54:12.319 --> 54:14.621
<i>Well, my dad.</i>

54:14.655 --> 54:17.090
<i>Your dad?
Tell me about him.</i>

54:17.124 --> 54:22.229
<i>He would bring me to...
There was this forest that...</i>

54:22.262 --> 54:23.564
<i>Louder.</i>

54:23.597 --> 54:27.401
- <i>There was this forest...</i>
- <i>A little louder.</i>

54:27.434 --> 54:30.270
Could you give it
a rest over there?

54:30.304 --> 54:32.406
What else am
I supposed to do?

54:50.624 --> 54:52.058
What the fuck?

55:03.470 --> 55:05.539
What, so it's okay if you do it?

55:05.572 --> 55:07.907
Yep.
It's my show.

55:11.043 --> 55:13.580
Oh, man.
There's beautiful stuff.

55:14.715 --> 55:15.982
Yeah, what does it matter?

55:16.517 --> 55:17.950
What?

55:18.719 --> 55:20.687
I said, what does it matter?

55:20.721 --> 55:22.389
Hmm?

55:23.624 --> 55:26.025
Well,

55:26.058 --> 55:29.396
whenever whatever that witch
doctor gave us wears off,

55:30.497 --> 55:31.498
it matters.

56:08.402 --> 56:10.102
Would you like to offer this?

56:45.405 --> 56:46.673
You can ask for a feather.

56:56.817 --> 56:58.151
What did it say?

57:07.427 --> 57:09.563
Encounter with raven
is rare.

57:11.465 --> 57:16.068
Some people say
it gives the gift of magic.

57:17.571 --> 57:19.206
Seeing into the dark.

57:31.718 --> 57:33.387
<i>I wanna do a little intro.</i>

57:33.420 --> 57:37.291
<i>We just arrived. We'll talk about the
recent activity, Bigfoot, people that...</i>

59:10.584 --> 59:12.853
<i>This
isn't how we're raising her.</i>

59:12.886 --> 59:14.421
<i>They're offerings.</i>

59:16.590 --> 59:18.425
<i>Do you know what
she brought to school today?</i>

59:20.594 --> 59:22.295
A dead sparrow.

59:23.430 --> 59:27.300
- And this?
- They're like prayers.

59:29.302 --> 59:30.737
She's praying to dead
animals now.

59:30.771 --> 59:33.607
- No, you don't understand.
- Writing letters to them,

59:33.640 --> 59:35.575
talking to them
out in the woods.

59:37.711 --> 59:40.213
You're not encouraging
this anymore.

59:41.481 --> 59:42.516
Do you understand?

59:43.450 --> 59:45.619
This is dangerous.

59:52.993 --> 59:56.229
Hey, where'd you
get that footage?

59:56.263 --> 59:58.699
- What?
- The footage.

59:58.732 --> 01:00:01.368
Uh, when we got here,
by the diner.

01:00:01.401 --> 01:00:03.336
You didn't
get this from our office?

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:04.838
- What? The camera?
- Yeah.

01:00:04.871 --> 01:00:06.907
- No. I got it at the rental...
- You sure?

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:09.309
- Yes.
- Leave him alone.

01:00:09.342 --> 01:00:10.343
Well done.

01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:12.245
Fuck, yes.

01:00:12.913 --> 01:00:13.914
All right.

01:00:17.384 --> 01:00:19.352
This is mine now.
Nobody touches it.

01:00:20.487 --> 01:00:22.989
That means you, "C" cam.

01:00:23.023 --> 01:00:26.359
I hope to God I still
remember this when I'm not high.

01:00:29.529 --> 01:00:30.630
He didn't give us drugs.

01:00:31.898 --> 01:00:34.835
Then you
explain all this?

01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:39.107
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.742
Look, can somebody please
explain to me what the fuck...

01:00:41.775 --> 01:00:42.976
The footage...

01:00:44.044 --> 01:00:46.446
you shot, we saw it
six days ago.

01:00:49.082 --> 01:00:50.517
It already happened.

01:01:00.327 --> 01:01:02.496
- Let me see it.
- No, you're not messing this up.

01:01:02.529 --> 01:01:03.830
Yeah. Messing what up?

01:01:03.864 --> 01:01:06.533
The show that
I'm making about this.

01:01:08.468 --> 01:01:10.036
This fucking show.

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:12.038
What? I think you'd all
be happy about this.

01:01:12.072 --> 01:01:13.141
I'm gonna make you all famous.

01:01:13.174 --> 01:01:16.009
So this is basically
all just one big joke to you?

01:01:17.077 --> 01:01:18.812
You do your little thing...

01:01:18.845 --> 01:01:20.680
- Yeah.
- ...make a mockery out of all this?

01:01:20.714 --> 01:01:22.382
That's the show.

01:01:22.415 --> 01:01:23.750
Well, you should be proud.

01:01:26.953 --> 01:01:28.388
Well, I am.

01:01:31.491 --> 01:01:33.326
People love my show.

01:01:34.561 --> 01:01:35.629
You know why?

01:01:39.499 --> 01:01:41.434
Because it's
a little bit clever

01:01:42.502 --> 01:01:43.904
and a little bit spooky.

01:01:45.438 --> 01:01:47.574
And, underneath,
it's all bullshit.

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:53.947
So, people will get scared,
and then...

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:56.117
rip it apart
during the closing credits,

01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:57.851
so they can feel safe again.

01:01:59.486 --> 01:02:02.556
And then tune in next week
for just enough adventure

01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:04.891
to make your lives feel like
they fucking mean something.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.428
But they don't.

01:02:08.461 --> 01:02:10.797
Grow the fuck up.
Nothing means anything.

01:02:12.866 --> 01:02:14.367
Unless we say it does.

01:02:17.138 --> 01:02:19.539
<i>♪ Truth Stalkers ♪</i>

01:02:21.142 --> 01:02:25.745
I love how smart I am
when I take drugs.

01:02:29.015 --> 01:02:30.784
He didn't give us drugs.

01:02:30.817 --> 01:02:32.085
Here we go again.

01:02:33.053 --> 01:02:34.855
When?

01:02:34.888 --> 01:02:36.523
When did he give us drugs?

01:02:41.661 --> 01:02:42.896
I saw your eyes.

01:02:44.798 --> 01:02:46.032
You were scared.

01:02:48.034 --> 01:02:49.069
Why?

01:02:53.506 --> 01:02:54.507
Explain to me...

01:02:55.642 --> 01:02:56.977
how we got back here again.

01:02:59.045 --> 01:03:01.882
And before, when we
were 10 feet apart,

01:03:01.915 --> 01:03:03.550
and all of a sudden,
you were gone.

01:03:06.786 --> 01:03:09.556
What did you see, Jeremy? Huh?

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:17.430
Okay.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.401
You win.

01:03:23.204 --> 01:03:25.106
We really are

01:03:25.139 --> 01:03:29.509
in a magical, mystical,
wonderful forest.

01:03:29.542 --> 01:03:31.912
Makes people disappear
and then reappear,

01:03:31.945 --> 01:03:34.948
walk in a straight line,
but really go in a circle.

01:03:34.981 --> 01:03:36.117
We found it.

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.718
The fucking meaning of life.

01:03:38.752 --> 01:03:41.021
I feel so much better now.

01:03:47.894 --> 01:03:49.963
Is it nice to believe
in shit like that?

01:03:51.598 --> 01:03:52.732
Hopeful shit?

01:03:53.867 --> 01:03:55.635
Does it help you
sleep better at night?

01:04:58.798 --> 01:05:00.800
Let's go, Nina. Enough.

01:05:04.771 --> 01:05:06.039
He's not coming with.

01:05:06.639 --> 01:05:07.707
Why?

01:05:08.575 --> 01:05:10.543
He's filling your head
with nonsense.

01:05:42.942 --> 01:05:44.077
Nina Noon,

01:05:45.078 --> 01:05:47.114
that a, uh, stage name?

01:05:51.118 --> 01:05:52.153
Sort of.

01:05:57.857 --> 01:05:59.126
We changed our name,

01:06:00.361 --> 01:06:01.694
my mom and me.

01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:04.265
She didn't want
my dad to find us.

01:06:06.733 --> 01:06:09.602
Now you're an actress pretending
to search for a monster?

01:06:18.878 --> 01:06:19.979
Hey, listen to this.

01:06:23.417 --> 01:06:25.585
Why are you
so afraid of silence?

01:06:26.753 --> 01:06:28.721
Silence is the root
of everything.

01:06:30.023 --> 01:06:31.958
When you spiral into its void,

01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:34.727
a hundred voices
thunder out messages

01:06:34.761 --> 01:06:36.163
you long to hear.

01:06:42.269 --> 01:06:43.903
This place makes me think of it.

01:06:46.005 --> 01:06:48.275
My teacher used to recite it
when we were out here.

01:06:57.284 --> 01:06:59.220
Do you understand
what's happening here?

01:07:07.194 --> 01:07:08.628
We're in a spiral.

01:07:12.031 --> 01:07:13.167
Here.

01:07:21.908 --> 01:07:22.942
Forward

01:07:24.478 --> 01:07:25.912
leads back.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.182
Going out

01:07:28.915 --> 01:07:30.049
circles in.

01:07:32.353 --> 01:07:33.887
When we try to leave,

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.822
we come back around
to a place that feels the same.

01:07:39.493 --> 01:07:41.262
Each rung is like an echo.

01:07:52.473 --> 01:07:53.706
How do we get to the center?

01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:58.245
Hey. We're leaving.

01:08:04.151 --> 01:08:05.818
You can follow us if you want.

01:08:08.522 --> 01:08:09.756
I'm going with him.

01:08:40.154 --> 01:08:42.020
Could be like
a time-travel angle,

01:08:42.956 --> 01:08:44.957
but I don't know.
Throwing a weird creature

01:08:44.991 --> 01:08:47.228
into the mix, that might be too
much for one show. I don't know.

01:08:47.261 --> 01:08:48.728
Just one sec. One sec.

01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:50.729
What?

01:08:51.898 --> 01:08:55.969
There should be
a fork in the road.

01:08:56.002 --> 01:08:58.305
The main thing is we got
to keep this place hidden.

01:09:00.307 --> 01:09:03.009
We got to have exclusive access.

01:09:03.042 --> 01:09:05.412
You know, only a failed writer
would find accomplishment

01:09:05.446 --> 01:09:08.282
in turning this all into a joke.

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:10.984
Why don't you trot after Nina
and your guide?

01:09:11.017 --> 01:09:14.020
They're probably sliding down a
rainbow on a unicorn right now.

01:09:14.053 --> 01:09:16.256
Rochelle, I'm telling you,
we got to pitch this thing

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:18.325
as soon as we get a signal.

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:20.426
- Right.
- Okay.

01:09:20.461 --> 01:09:21.828
It's this way.

01:09:32.171 --> 01:09:33.307
Rochelle?

01:09:34.608 --> 01:09:36.809
All right. Hold up
a second.

01:09:40.247 --> 01:09:44.218
I'm fine, by the way.
No need to worry about me.

01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:49.189
Rochelle.

01:09:55.396 --> 01:09:56.397
Rochelle.

01:09:58.399 --> 01:09:59.866
Rochelle.

01:10:07.207 --> 01:10:08.208
Hey.

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:11.211
Wait.

01:10:12.379 --> 01:10:14.013
What the hell?

01:11:32.959 --> 01:11:36.630
I see her.
Rochelle. I see her.

01:12:41.662 --> 01:12:42.696
Let's go.

01:12:44.231 --> 01:12:45.232
We don't have time.

01:12:47.234 --> 01:12:48.368
You can't stay here.

01:12:50.637 --> 01:12:52.004
Jeremy?

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.974
Let's go.

01:12:56.042 --> 01:12:57.244
We need to gather the others.

01:13:57.437 --> 01:13:59.071
What happened here?

01:13:59.106 --> 01:14:00.107
Don't know.

01:14:01.575 --> 01:14:03.042
Never been this far.

01:14:13.453 --> 01:14:15.789
<i>My teacher told me
it was cordoned off briefly.</i>

01:14:17.624 --> 01:14:20.227
<i>People set out
to study this place...</i>

01:14:21.194 --> 01:14:22.462
<i>Tried to, at least.</i>

01:14:29.469 --> 01:14:31.371
<i>Laws of physics,</i>

01:14:31.405 --> 01:14:33.540
<i>rules, theories, proof.</i>

01:14:35.409 --> 01:14:36.777
<i>How could they understand?</i>

01:14:38.211 --> 01:14:39.780
<i>What measurement,</i>

01:14:39.813 --> 01:14:41.582
<i>what instrument could ever tell</i>

01:14:41.615 --> 01:14:44.083
<i>that it was only
looking into a mirror?</i>

01:14:46.219 --> 01:14:48.488
<i>What way of looking outward
could ever be anything</i>

01:14:48.522 --> 01:14:50.624
<i>but a never-ending loop
back in?</i>

01:15:27.794 --> 01:15:29.529
You said
it was a warning...

01:15:30.297 --> 01:15:31.431
the yell.

01:15:34.668 --> 01:15:36.470
There's something here.

01:15:49.349 --> 01:15:51.218
Everyone
sees them differently.

01:16:04.865 --> 01:16:06.700
I like to think
they're guardians.

01:16:19.713 --> 01:16:20.847
What do they protect?

01:16:21.648 --> 01:16:23.884
There is something here.

01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:25.585
Like anything,

01:16:25.619 --> 01:16:28.255
they bring back to us
whatever we bring to it.

01:16:34.728 --> 01:16:37.664
<i>What do they protect?</i>

01:16:41.768 --> 01:16:42.869
People...

01:16:43.737 --> 01:16:45.005
from themselves.

01:17:29.916 --> 01:17:31.384
Great spirit,

01:17:32.953 --> 01:17:35.655
guide me.
Send me your protection.

01:17:38.558 --> 01:17:40.794
Even though I feel alone,

01:17:40.827 --> 01:17:43.296
I know that you are with me.

01:17:44.097 --> 01:17:45.832
Show me what I need to see.

01:17:59.946 --> 01:18:01.982
<i>Let's go, Nina. Enough.</i>

01:19:02.143 --> 01:19:04.845
<i>Just like everything else
he promised you,</i>

01:19:04.878 --> 01:19:07.747
<i>all that time communing
with the dead.</i>

01:19:12.786 --> 01:19:14.521
<i>Those prayers won't help.</i>

01:19:16.656 --> 01:19:17.958
<i>They're not real.</i>

01:19:21.094 --> 01:19:22.896
<i>Look at where they've led you.</i>

01:19:51.658 --> 01:19:53.660
Trying to hide, little witch?

01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:58.165
You can't talk to birds, huh?

01:19:58.199 --> 01:20:00.533
We're gonna burn you, witch.

01:20:00.567 --> 01:20:03.570
Nina.
Look what he's done to you.

01:20:03.603 --> 01:20:05.038
I told you not
to do those things.

01:20:05.071 --> 01:20:06.140
I told you this would happen.

01:20:09.143 --> 01:20:11.178
<i>It responds to us.</i>

01:20:11.212 --> 01:20:12.346
I'm getting us outta here.

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:13.446
<i>He's filling
your head with nonsense.</i>

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.982
<i>Enough Nina.
There's nothing here.</i>

01:20:16.683 --> 01:20:17.484
<i>Wait.</i>

01:20:17.517 --> 01:20:18.885
He's not coming with.

01:20:27.627 --> 01:20:28.895
- Nina.
- No.

01:21:43.903 --> 01:21:45.038
What you working on?

01:21:48.074 --> 01:21:49.743
Look, Dad.

01:21:49.776 --> 01:21:51.778
It's lovely, but it's
past your bedtime.

01:21:52.213 --> 01:21:54.281
It's an offering.

01:21:54.315 --> 01:21:56.082
Nina, we talked about that.

01:21:58.185 --> 01:21:59.719
But I'm ready, Dad.

01:22:00.787 --> 01:22:02.789
Teach me more.

01:22:02.822 --> 01:22:04.824
We promised that
we wouldn't, honey.

01:22:06.926 --> 01:22:07.961
I'm like you.

01:22:10.231 --> 01:22:11.531
Teach me.

01:23:58.472 --> 01:23:59.973
Tell me about this.

01:25:22.556 --> 01:25:23.890
Was it real?

01:26:13.173 --> 01:26:16.477
<i>I don't...
I can't think of anything.</i>

01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:19.446
<i>Um, maybe,
uh, tell me about this place.</i>

01:26:22.048 --> 01:26:23.350
<i>I don't know
where to start.</i>

01:26:25.918 --> 01:26:29.556
<i>Growing up in the area, we used
to hear about some of the...</i>

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:32.892
<i>folklore. We used to hear
some stories of...</i>

01:26:32.925 --> 01:26:35.429
- <i>Say that again, just a little louder.</i>
- <i>Say what?</i>

01:26:35.462 --> 01:26:37.598
- <i>My dad, he...</i>
- <i>Your dad,</i>

01:26:37.631 --> 01:26:39.300
<i>oh, that's better.</i>

01:26:39.333 --> 01:26:40.933
<i>Um, anything you want.</i>

01:26:42.536 --> 01:26:43.803
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:26:45.104 --> 01:26:46.906
<i>He taught me, um...</i>

01:26:46.939 --> 01:26:48.208
<i>Louder.</i>

01:26:50.344 --> 01:26:51.412
<i>A little louder.</i>

01:26:55.215 --> 01:26:56.350
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

01:26:58.084 --> 01:26:59.353
<i>my dad, he, uh,</i>

01:27:00.621 --> 01:27:02.256
<i>he was interested in nature,</i>

01:27:03.624 --> 01:27:05.292
<i>in the magic of nature.</i>

01:27:08.495 --> 01:27:11.365
<i>He was just fascinated by it.</i>

01:27:14.234 --> 01:27:18.172
And he saw things
that were invisible to most.

01:28:33.079 --> 01:28:34.648
And I thought if I could

01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:38.118
open my mind...
