01:18.544 --> 01:20.745
(sighs)

01:20.813 --> 01:27.084
Now I know what drove
   Scott Fitzgerald to drink.

01:27.152 --> 01:28.520
What's that?

01:28.588 --> 01:33.057
A little piece of paper
           that says

01:33.125 --> 01:37.729
"You drained your soul into
  the typewriter for naught."

01:37.797 --> 01:40.030
Let me see.
                 Let me see.

01:40.098 --> 01:42.433
It's from the Kenderson
                Literary Agency.

01:42.501 --> 01:45.337
"Dear Mr. Ignatowski,
    although your submission

01:45.404 --> 01:47.239
"was one of the most
    interesting we've read,

01:47.306 --> 01:51.142
"unfortunately, it does not
    suit our needs at this time.

01:51.209 --> 01:55.079
Therefore, we are returning
 your <i>M*A S*H</i> script herewith."

01:55.147 --> 01:57.415
Oh! Ho-ho!

01:57.483 --> 01:59.050
You wrote
     a script for <i>M*A S*H?</i>

01:59.117 --> 02:02.586
I gave birth to a script
         for <i>M*A S*H--</i>

02:02.654 --> 02:06.224
a great script.

02:06.291 --> 02:08.860
Well, Jim, what was it about?

02:08.928 --> 02:11.062
A simple story.

02:11.130 --> 02:13.898
I'm surprised they
                haven't done it.

02:13.966 --> 02:18.570
Hawkeye has to perform
   surgery on Colonel Potter,

02:18.637 --> 02:23.374
all the while being disrupted by
shelling from the North Koreans

02:23.442 --> 02:26.411
and a Zaxalonian starship.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.347
Oh, wait, wait, wait,
       wait, wait, wait.

02:29.415 --> 02:31.949
Are you talking about aliens
      from another planet?

02:32.017 --> 02:34.552
Yeah, the Zaxalonians.

02:36.555 --> 02:39.624
Their bodies
    are the size of a grape.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.895
And here is where
            the switch comes in.

02:47.065 --> 02:49.400
The queen of the Zaxalonians,

02:49.468 --> 02:53.004
disguised as an earring,

02:53.072 --> 02:54.806
falls in love with Klinger.

02:57.009 --> 02:58.676
Huh?

02:58.744 --> 03:00.211
Um...
                 (clears throat)

03:00.278 --> 03:01.812
Well, how does it end?

03:01.880 --> 03:05.150
Comedy... tragedy...

03:05.218 --> 03:08.119
and a statement against war.

03:09.788 --> 03:12.657
And a pie fight.

03:12.725 --> 03:13.925
LOUIE:
                    Hey, Reiger.

03:13.993 --> 03:15.126
Yeah.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.794
Uh, Jeff told me
          to tell you

03:16.862 --> 03:19.631
that he was picking up
     some shipment of yours

03:19.698 --> 03:20.965
at the airport.

03:21.033 --> 03:23.401
Oh, thanks, Lou. Hey!

03:23.469 --> 03:25.637
I've got a surprise
         for you guys.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.973
So guess who's going to be
 licking my face in 15 minutes.

03:29.041 --> 03:31.543
Not me.

03:31.611 --> 03:32.911
Buddy.
          You got it!

03:32.979 --> 03:34.379
All right, Buddy! Hey!
                          Buddy!

03:34.446 --> 03:36.514
Oh, Alex! How come you didn't
       tell us Buddy was coming?

03:36.582 --> 03:38.349
I would have gotten him
            a bone or something.

03:38.417 --> 03:39.784
I wanted to surprise you.

03:39.852 --> 03:42.087
JIM:
             Uh...name of Buddy,

03:42.154 --> 03:46.291
licks faces, likes bones.

03:46.359 --> 03:47.558
Buddy Hackett?

03:47.626 --> 03:49.960
No, no, no, not Buddy Hackett.

03:50.028 --> 03:52.430
No, no, no, no.
Buddy's my dog.

03:52.498 --> 03:53.998
I raised him from a puppy.

03:54.065 --> 03:56.667
The last few years, I let
my sister take care of him.

03:56.735 --> 03:58.903
She's got this, uh,
backyard and kids, you know,

03:58.971 --> 04:00.371
for the dog to play with.

04:00.439 --> 04:01.572
But, well, he's gotten old,

04:01.640 --> 04:02.907
so I'm going
to take him back

04:02.974 --> 04:04.342
and he's going to come and live
with me in my apartment.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.610
You're going
   to love him, too, Jim.

04:05.677 --> 04:06.877
Yeah.
This dog's really smart.

04:06.945 --> 04:10.014
This dog is the smartest dog
      in the entire world.

04:10.082 --> 04:11.349
(both chuckling)

04:11.416 --> 04:13.818
Now wait, wait, wait, Alex--
Alex, I mean, the dog is smart,

04:13.886 --> 04:15.854
but I don't think he's the
smartest dog in the whole world.

04:15.921 --> 04:17.221
Oh, yes he is.

04:17.289 --> 04:19.656
This dog is probably the
smartest dog that ever lived.

04:19.725 --> 04:21.791
Now, wait a minute, Alex.

04:21.860 --> 04:24.896
I've known a lot of
          smart dogs in my time,

04:24.964 --> 04:27.999
so when you say you've got the
   smartest dog that ever lived,

04:28.067 --> 04:30.468
I have to, I have to,
       I have to call you on it.

04:30.536 --> 04:31.736
Ah...

04:31.803 --> 04:33.471
What does this dog do?

04:33.538 --> 04:36.274
You point your finger at him
like a gun, you go bang,

04:36.342 --> 04:38.443
he rolls over and plays dead.

04:39.945 --> 04:42.914
You must have stole
              him from a circus!

04:42.981 --> 04:44.983
Ooh, I sure hope
   I don't get an assignment

04:45.050 --> 04:46.884
before Buddy gets here.

04:46.952 --> 04:51.222
Buddy? You mean that shipment
   you're expecting is Buddy?

04:51.290 --> 04:52.457
Yeah.
           Your dog?

04:52.524 --> 04:53.591
Yeah.
The man-eater?

04:53.659 --> 04:54.726
What?

04:54.793 --> 04:56.494
I thought that wretched cur

04:56.562 --> 04:58.229
had been dead for years.

04:58.297 --> 04:59.697
Damn it!

04:59.765 --> 05:01.332
I slept better thinking

05:01.400 --> 05:03.701
that that mongrel
  was roasting in doggie hell.

05:03.769 --> 05:04.902
He's vicious!

05:04.970 --> 05:05.937
He's not vicious.
       Oh, yeah?

05:06.005 --> 05:07.572
The last time
    he was here, he bit me.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.207
You bit him first.

05:09.275 --> 05:10.875
Don't worry about it.
     Don't worry about it.

05:10.943 --> 05:13.144
I guarantee he's not going
 to bite you again, all right?

05:13.212 --> 05:14.745
Oh, I don't know, Alex.

05:14.813 --> 05:17.248
Uh, they say that once a dog
      has tasted slime...

05:17.316 --> 05:18.783
(laughing)

05:18.851 --> 05:21.719
You won't be, won't be making
     funny remarks, Nardo,

05:21.787 --> 05:25.523
when that dog's got his fangs
      in your vocal cords.

05:25.590 --> 05:31.329
Reiger, that dog had better
        be in a cage and muzzled

05:31.397 --> 05:33.097
because he is a
                  hound of hell.

05:33.165 --> 05:34.498
He's a devil dog.

05:34.566 --> 05:35.667
Oh, come on.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.636
(Buddy whimpers)

05:38.704 --> 05:40.538
Hey, Alex, here's your dog.

05:40.606 --> 05:42.139
There's my Buddy.

05:43.942 --> 05:45.910
Oh, Buddy.
       There's my Buddy.

05:45.977 --> 05:47.378
Hey.
       There's my Buddy.

05:47.446 --> 05:48.479
(smooching)

05:48.547 --> 05:50.214
It <i>is</i> better
    to be back with me, hmm?

05:54.186 --> 05:55.586
(door unlocking)

06:10.402 --> 06:12.570
Hey, Bud.

06:12.638 --> 06:13.905
Buddy, Buddy, Buddy,
Buddy, Buddy, Buddy.

06:16.041 --> 06:17.174
Buddy, Buddy, Buddy,
Buddy, Buddy.

06:17.242 --> 06:18.443
(whimpers)
(laughing)

06:18.510 --> 06:19.577
How's my Buddy, huh?

06:19.645 --> 06:21.245
Come on, Buddy, come on.

06:21.313 --> 06:22.680
Come on, Buddy.
Come on, come on.

06:22.747 --> 06:24.682
Come on, come on.
Get yourself up.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.183
There you go.

06:26.251 --> 06:27.652
How's my Buddy, huh?

06:27.720 --> 06:28.919
You glad to see me?

06:28.987 --> 06:30.588
Sure you are.

06:30.655 --> 06:35.160
Have you been up to mischief
 today or were you a good dog?

06:35.227 --> 06:37.561
(baby talk):
Were you a good dog today?

06:37.629 --> 06:39.096
(smooching)

06:39.164 --> 06:40.231
Huh?

06:40.299 --> 06:43.734
Aren't you going to answer me?

06:43.802 --> 06:45.670
Aren't you going
to answer me, Buddy?

06:45.737 --> 06:48.906
Buddy, come on.
      I know you can talk.

06:48.974 --> 06:50.741
Say, "Reiger."

06:50.809 --> 06:52.643
Reiger.

06:52.711 --> 06:54.679
(growling):
            Reiger.

06:56.147 --> 06:57.382
Come on, the "rrr"
    and the "grr" are easy.

06:57.449 --> 06:58.549
All you gotta do
      is put an 'E' in it.

06:58.617 --> 07:00.785
(growling):
            Reiger.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.354
You like it when I'm an idiot
       to you, don't you?

07:03.421 --> 07:04.656
I love it.

07:04.723 --> 07:06.858
Huh? Oh.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.359
Oh, hi, hi, Simka.
                     Hi...

07:08.427 --> 07:11.195
(growls):
            Reiger.

07:11.263 --> 07:12.864
I didn't even realize
        you were there.

07:12.931 --> 07:14.665
Don't worry about
                  nothin', Alex.

07:14.733 --> 07:17.201
I not going to tell
              nobody about this.

07:17.269 --> 07:18.936
If anybody finds
                 out about this,

07:19.004 --> 07:22.473
it'll be because Buddy
      can't keep his mouth shut.

07:22.541 --> 07:24.375
So, uh, what brings you here?

07:24.442 --> 07:27.345
Well, Alex, in my
       country, it's a tradition

07:27.413 --> 07:31.682
that when a friend gets a new
      beast, it must be blessed.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.886
Do I mind if I
               bless your beast?

07:34.954 --> 07:37.521
Well, no, I guess the,
uh, beast is agreeable.

07:37.589 --> 07:38.690
(chuckles)
Sure.

07:38.757 --> 07:39.791
Good.
             Sure.

07:43.929 --> 07:47.532
Okay, stay there.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.133
All right.

07:49.201 --> 07:51.503
Keps!

07:51.570 --> 07:53.737
That's it?

07:53.805 --> 07:57.875
If you wanted a bigger blessing,
 you should've got a elephant.

07:59.845 --> 08:00.945
(clears throat)

08:01.013 --> 08:02.680
Now, let's see this trick.

08:02.748 --> 08:03.914
What trick?

08:03.982 --> 08:06.950
You know, the trick
   that Elaine told me about.

08:07.018 --> 08:09.654
You know, Alex, the greatest
   trick that a dog ever did,

08:09.722 --> 08:12.257
the one where you, you point
     your finger like a gun

08:12.324 --> 08:14.058
and you shoot
      Buddy the Wonder Dog

08:14.125 --> 08:16.293
and he staggers, as though
       mortally wounded,

08:16.361 --> 08:17.462
and then he spins around

08:17.530 --> 08:19.830
as if he's dying a slow,
        agonizing death

08:19.898 --> 08:23.534
until he shudders, collapses,
   breathes his last breath,

08:23.602 --> 08:24.869
falls over on his back,

08:24.937 --> 08:28.972
kicks all four legs
   up into the air and dies.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.342
Oh, that trick.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.212
No, uh, I-I think
     it's been exaggerated.

08:34.279 --> 08:36.880
I mean, basically, what I do is
    I point my finger at him

08:36.948 --> 08:38.515
and he just lies down
         on the floor.

08:38.582 --> 08:40.683
All right, I'm flexible.

08:40.751 --> 08:43.421
Well, well, you see, I, I've
been trying to get him to do it

08:43.489 --> 08:45.189
all day, but somehow
I think he's forgotten it.

08:45.257 --> 08:47.425
But, you know, he's an old dog.
He's 19 years old.

08:47.492 --> 08:50.194
You know how old
that is in dog years?

08:50.262 --> 08:52.062
Yeah, that's about 600.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.664
It's 133.

08:53.732 --> 08:55.299
I said "about."

08:55.367 --> 08:56.467
(laughs)

08:56.535 --> 08:57.935
What about this trick, Alex?

08:58.003 --> 08:59.036
Huh?

08:59.104 --> 09:00.537
Are you trying to
             change the subject?

09:00.605 --> 09:03.741
Okay, the trick.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.309
Yeah!
Okay.

09:05.377 --> 09:07.178
Come here, Buddy.
                      Come here.

09:07.245 --> 09:09.213
There,
just stay right there.

09:09.281 --> 09:10.448
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

09:10.515 --> 09:12.015
There's a good dog.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.684
Buddy, watch up now.

09:13.751 --> 09:16.087
(both chuckling)

09:16.154 --> 09:18.088
(hums "William Tell Overture")

09:21.226 --> 09:23.928
Return with us now to the
thrilling days of yesteryear.

09:23.996 --> 09:26.264
Look out, Buddy! There's one
    on the roof behind you.

09:26.331 --> 09:27.264
Look out!
You can't see him!

09:27.332 --> 09:28.265
Oh! It's too late.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.268
Bang!

09:33.806 --> 09:37.408
Oh...
             (sobs)

09:37.476 --> 09:38.542
What's wrong?

09:38.610 --> 09:41.478
Oh, Alex.

09:43.048 --> 09:46.283
You got such
        a stupid beast!

09:50.922 --> 09:52.689
ALEX:
      <i>So what's the matter</i>
        <i>with Buddy, Doc?</i>

09:52.757 --> 09:56.027
Uh, Alex,

09:56.095 --> 10:00.497
a dog is like
                  an automobile.

10:00.565 --> 10:02.766
No matter how well
you take care of it,

10:02.834 --> 10:05.002
eventually, the parts
will wear out.

10:05.070 --> 10:06.637
It breaks down.

10:06.705 --> 10:08.873
Now, in a newer car,
it's usually just a,

10:08.941 --> 10:11.942
just a fan belt
or a battery.

10:12.010 --> 10:15.245
But in an older car, it's more
 likely to be something major,

10:15.313 --> 10:17.715
like the transmission.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.550
So what's wrong
  with the dog, Doc?

10:19.618 --> 10:24.989
Is it a transmission
 or do his paws need rotating?

10:25.057 --> 10:26.490
(laughing)

10:26.558 --> 10:28.492
Yes, that was a bad analogy.

10:31.696 --> 10:35.366
I think I should say
 that a dog is, is like a wine.

10:35.434 --> 10:38.335
Yes, a French Burgundy,

10:38.403 --> 10:39.403
that has its
peak years...

10:39.471 --> 10:40.504
Doctor...

10:40.572 --> 10:41.906
...and then,
later on...

10:41.974 --> 10:44.142
Doctor, would you just tell
  me when a dog is like a dog?

10:44.209 --> 10:49.680
In cold, stark terms, your dog
     has advanced diabetes.

10:49.748 --> 10:52.115
His kidneys
     are beginning to fail.

10:52.183 --> 10:57.155
He has some disorders of the
 intestinal tract and bladder.

10:57.222 --> 11:00.257
I'm afraid
   he hasn't much time left.

11:00.325 --> 11:02.293
How much time does he have?

11:02.361 --> 11:04.762
Well, I can't be sure.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.197
Could be two weeks.
Could be a month.

11:07.265 --> 11:08.666
(whimpers)

11:08.734 --> 11:11.535
And as difficult as it is
for me to say this,

11:11.603 --> 11:15.072
the logical thing to do is
to put him to sleep now.

11:22.180 --> 11:23.847
Is he in pain?

11:23.915 --> 11:25.082
No.

11:25.150 --> 11:26.350
Then you're not going
      to put him to sleep.

11:26.418 --> 11:29.586
I'm going to make his
              life worth living.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.991
As long as there's
   a breath left in this dog,

11:34.059 --> 11:35.860
you're not going
   to put this dog to sleep.

11:35.927 --> 11:37.094
He's going to be
        the happiest dog

11:37.162 --> 11:38.362
that ever walked the streets
       of New York City,

11:38.429 --> 11:39.764
I'll tell you that.

11:39.831 --> 11:41.231
And I don't want to hear any
more about putting him to sleep.

11:41.299 --> 11:42.332
I don't want to
                hear you mention

11:42.400 --> 11:43.501
putting him to sleep.
                 You understand?

11:43.569 --> 11:45.035
Now, Mr. Reiger,
you're obviously upset.

11:45.103 --> 11:46.203
I am not upset,

11:46.271 --> 11:47.705
so don't call me upset!

11:47.773 --> 11:48.906
(growling)

11:48.974 --> 11:50.441
I'm in perfect control
                of my faculties.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.209
I know exactly
        what I'm doing.

11:54.579 --> 11:56.714
I know, I know!
I did it to amuse the dog.

11:56.782 --> 11:58.516
He happens to like humor.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.251
You love it, Buddy?
Come on, Buddy.

12:01.319 --> 12:03.387
You like funny stuff,
           don't you?

12:08.393 --> 12:09.626
You want another doggie candy?
   Want another doggie candy?

12:09.694 --> 12:11.094
(Buddy barks)

12:11.162 --> 12:12.764
Okay, but first you have to lie
     dead; you have to lay dead.

12:12.831 --> 12:17.301
Come on, bang,
                     bang, bang.

12:17.368 --> 12:20.071
Oh, well, what the
                 hell? Have one.

12:21.406 --> 12:23.474
You like being alive,
          don't you, Buddy, huh?

12:23.542 --> 12:25.343
Don't you? Yeah.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.978
No more till after
              dinner; that's it.

12:29.481 --> 12:32.549
Stay there.

12:32.617 --> 12:34.718
No more of this cold dog food
    straight out of the can

12:34.786 --> 12:37.254
for you, my friend.
             Uh-uh!

12:37.321 --> 12:41.325
I'm warming it up for doggie.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.661
And a little cheese.

12:43.728 --> 12:45.262
A little wine.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.001
Mmm, mmm!

12:51.069 --> 12:55.072
Oh, it's so good.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.774
You want to taste it?

12:56.841 --> 12:59.443
Here, taste this.

13:00.645 --> 13:02.947
What do you think? Hmm?

13:03.015 --> 13:05.149
A bit more oregano?
       Just what I was thinking.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.250
(knocking at door)

13:08.886 --> 13:11.221
Oh, look who's here.
It's Shawn.

13:11.289 --> 13:12.689
Hi, Alex.
Hi, Shawn.

13:12.757 --> 13:14.792
Shawn, I don't think you
ever met my dog Buddy.

13:14.859 --> 13:17.628
Buddy, this is Shawn.

13:17.696 --> 13:19.997
She's going to be
              around a lot more.

13:20.064 --> 13:22.199
I hope, I hope, I hope,
                 I hope, I hope.

13:22.267 --> 13:23.500
How about a kiss?

13:23.568 --> 13:25.035
Sure, he likes people.

13:25.103 --> 13:27.504
Hey!
                      Nah.

13:27.572 --> 13:29.506
Hey, come on.
     Let me take your coat.

13:29.574 --> 13:31.408
And, uh, I'll put a record on.

13:31.476 --> 13:33.410
Ah!

13:35.814 --> 13:37.882
Ooh, this smells delicious.

13:37.949 --> 13:39.316
I didn't know you cooked.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.255
That stuff on the stove is,
         uh, dog food.

13:44.322 --> 13:48.492
Don't be modest.
       This is excellent.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.961
No, really, it's dog food.
        It's for my dog.

13:51.029 --> 13:53.130
It's my... Oh, no.

13:53.198 --> 13:57.134
It-it-it's...
              That's for my dog.

13:57.202 --> 13:59.803
Oh, come on, Alex,
there's wine in here and...

13:59.871 --> 14:00.904
No, no, really.

14:00.972 --> 14:02.139
It's been heated
and seasoned.

14:02.207 --> 14:04.074
No, really, it... This
         is the main ingredient.

14:04.142 --> 14:06.077
Dog food.

14:07.512 --> 14:09.981
Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on,
      you liked it a minute ago.

14:10.048 --> 14:12.583
And, besides, there's
     nothing disgusting in here.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.218
Just read it.
                     Look, here.

14:14.285 --> 14:17.954
Fish by-products,
     artificial caramel coloring

14:18.022 --> 14:19.823
and pork organs.

14:19.891 --> 14:23.294
Oh, my...

14:23.361 --> 14:24.461
God.

14:24.529 --> 14:28.565
Nobody should eat
               that stuff. Eh...

14:28.633 --> 14:30.635
No more of that stuff
      for you, my doggie.

14:30.702 --> 14:32.469
No sirree, Bob!

14:32.537 --> 14:36.707
From now on, it's prime rib
    and Chateaubriand and...

14:36.775 --> 14:38.375
Alex!
              Huh?

14:38.443 --> 14:40.110
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh...

14:40.178 --> 14:41.412
(chuckles)

14:41.480 --> 14:43.714
You see, my-my dog
              is a very old dog.

14:43.781 --> 14:46.116
He's, uh... He hasn't
             got much time left.

14:46.184 --> 14:48.152
He's probably got about
            two weeks to a month

14:48.219 --> 14:51.221
and I just want
              to make him happy.

14:51.289 --> 14:52.790
That's why your apartment
looks like

14:52.857 --> 14:54.858
a testing lab
for Hartz Mountain.

14:54.926 --> 14:56.327
Oh, hey, come on.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.995
Just because I'm trying
               to make him happy

14:58.063 --> 14:59.496
doesn't mean I can't
                 make you happy.

14:59.564 --> 15:01.231
(chuckles)
            Come on, sit down.

15:01.299 --> 15:04.401
Sit down.

15:04.469 --> 15:05.603
(growls)

15:05.670 --> 15:07.204
Oh, you look great.
You look great.

15:07.272 --> 15:08.472
Mmm...

15:08.540 --> 15:11.208
(whimpers)

15:11.276 --> 15:13.310
(smooches)

15:13.377 --> 15:15.212
(laughs)

15:15.280 --> 15:18.949
Hey, I bet you there's a great
old movie on the tube tonight.

15:19.016 --> 15:20.951
Why can't we just
              go out to a movie?

15:21.019 --> 15:23.387
Oh, no, no, no, I can't.
I can't leave him alone.

15:23.454 --> 15:25.055
He's got a weak bladder.

15:29.194 --> 15:32.529
You know, uh, Alex, we'd only
      be gone a couple of hours.

15:32.597 --> 15:34.832
He couldn't possibly
                   do that much.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.934
Oh, yes, he could.

15:37.002 --> 15:39.670
Sometimes, when I come home,
there's a rainbow in here.

15:42.607 --> 15:45.141
Okay, okay, we
                   can watch TV.

15:45.209 --> 15:46.610
Oh, goody, goody, goody.
Did you hear that?

15:46.677 --> 15:47.711
We're going
to watch TV tonight, dog.

15:47.779 --> 15:49.279
(smooching, laughing)

15:49.347 --> 15:52.382
Ah, is there any particular
          show that Buddy likes?

15:52.450 --> 15:54.484
Uh, yeah, actually he likes
      the Letterman show,

15:54.552 --> 15:57.888
but he complains
  about too many commercials.

15:57.955 --> 16:01.325
(Buddy whimpers)

16:01.393 --> 16:03.927
You know, Alex,

16:03.995 --> 16:07.764
I'm sorry I was a little
         upset earlier, but, uh,

16:07.832 --> 16:10.501
I got to tell you,
                 eating dog food

16:10.569 --> 16:14.505
isn't exactly a great way
            to start an evening.

16:14.573 --> 16:16.073
Hey, these are great!

16:16.141 --> 16:19.143
Huh? Oh, no, uh...

16:19.210 --> 16:21.245
Yeah, that's-that's
what I've been told.

16:24.215 --> 16:25.416
You haven't tasted them?

16:25.483 --> 16:26.783
No, I-I...
               Come on, try one.

16:26.851 --> 16:27.918
No, I-I...

16:27.985 --> 16:30.187
Come on. For me?

16:30.254 --> 16:32.055
(chuckling anxiously)

16:32.123 --> 16:34.859
No, I-I don't
really like them.

16:34.926 --> 16:36.026
I...
                  Come on, Alex.

16:36.094 --> 16:37.761
Ah, nah... Oh.

16:37.829 --> 16:39.830
(chuckling)

16:39.898 --> 16:41.832
Have another.
Whoo.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.068
No, no...

16:45.136 --> 16:46.337
(Buddy whimpers)

16:46.405 --> 16:48.605
I'm sorry. You can't
have any of these, Buddy.

16:48.673 --> 16:51.408
These are people food.

16:51.476 --> 16:53.744
Oh, hi, how's Buddy?

16:53.812 --> 16:55.779
Well, look for yourself.
He's a new dog.

16:55.846 --> 16:58.348
See how frisky he is?
  Frisk, frisk, frisk, frisk.

16:58.416 --> 16:59.850
(chuckles)

16:59.918 --> 17:00.851
What's that dog doing here
again, Reiger?

17:00.919 --> 17:02.052
Uh, look, Louie, uh...

17:02.120 --> 17:04.288
When I'm driving around
      in the cab all day,

17:04.356 --> 17:06.123
well, that's eight hours
     that I'm not with him,

17:06.191 --> 17:08.459
so, uh, I want to take him
   in the cab with me, okay?

17:08.527 --> 17:09.660
Forget it.

17:09.727 --> 17:12.529
Look, I got a suggestion.
       You wanna hear it?

17:12.597 --> 17:13.731
Yeah.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.031
Why don't you take him in
           for a shot

17:15.099 --> 17:16.733
of "go to sleep, my doggie"?

17:16.800 --> 17:18.569
Oh, no.
                      Louie, no.

17:18.636 --> 17:20.804
ELAINE:
                        Louie...

17:20.872 --> 17:22.973
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

17:23.040 --> 17:24.708
What about Marino?
         Remember him?

17:24.776 --> 17:26.577
You let him take his dog
          in the cab.

17:26.644 --> 17:28.612
That was different.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.347
It was a Seeing Eye dog.

17:30.415 --> 17:32.249
Marino was blind?!

17:32.317 --> 17:33.784
Legally blind.

17:33.852 --> 17:35.552
He could still sort of see.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.588
The dog barked at red lights.

17:37.656 --> 17:38.922
It was during the strike.

17:38.990 --> 17:41.024
I tried it out for a week.
        It didn't work.

17:44.095 --> 17:46.797
Well, if you can't
    bend the rules a little,

17:46.865 --> 17:49.066
I'll just have
  to take a leave of absence.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.367
Come on, Alex.
   No, Alex.

17:50.435 --> 17:51.435
What're you going to do,
         start missing paychecks

17:51.503 --> 17:52.503
for the dog now?

17:52.570 --> 17:54.404
I don't care!
I made a promise to Buddy

17:54.472 --> 17:55.839
and I'm going to keep it.

17:55.907 --> 18:00.010
Alex, look, it's perfectly
   all right that, you know,

18:00.078 --> 18:02.179
you want him to live out his
    natural life and everything,

18:02.247 --> 18:04.215
I mean, and it's wonderful
  that you want him to be happy,

18:04.282 --> 18:07.084
but don't you think you're
     getting a little excessive?

18:07.152 --> 18:08.552
You're saying I should
put this dog to sleep?

18:08.619 --> 18:10.554
No!
       No, we love Buddy.

18:10.622 --> 18:11.555
Why not?

18:12.924 --> 18:15.926
Look, the dog is senile, Reiger.

18:15.993 --> 18:17.428
I mean, look at him.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.329
His brain has turned to Alpo.

18:21.132 --> 18:22.566
LOUIE:
                         Reiger,

18:22.634 --> 18:25.435
look, maybe you don't want to
  face the truth about Buddy,

18:25.503 --> 18:28.305
but look, look, that dog
 doesn't even know where he is.

18:28.373 --> 18:29.573
How do you know that?

18:29.641 --> 18:32.309
How does anyone know that?

18:32.376 --> 18:36.179
How can anyone say when to...
  when you put a dog to sleep?

18:36.247 --> 18:38.916
How can anyone say
  if the dog is alert or not?

18:38.983 --> 18:42.185
There's no way to find out
  what's in that head right now.

18:42.253 --> 18:43.687
Except one.
                     Except one!

18:43.754 --> 18:45.388
What? What?

18:45.456 --> 18:49.292
Have Buddy do that trick.

18:49.360 --> 18:53.330
Very interesting idea.

18:53.397 --> 18:56.100
Let's see him do the trick.

19:01.706 --> 19:03.908
Okay, he'll do the trick.

19:03.975 --> 19:05.609
Alex, you know he couldn't...
   No. Come on.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.077
No, he'll do the trick.

19:09.814 --> 19:11.081
If he doesn't do it,

19:11.149 --> 19:13.149
I'll walk out of here
         right now with the dog.

19:13.217 --> 19:15.619
But if he does it, he
         goes with me in my cab.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.421
And what's more,
             I'll let him drive.

19:21.158 --> 19:23.994
I know you can do it.

19:24.062 --> 19:27.064
(whimpers)

19:27.131 --> 19:31.268
(hums "William Tell Overture")

19:31.336 --> 19:33.703
Return with us now to the
   thrilling days of yesteryear.

19:33.771 --> 19:38.175
That's five aces
    you got there, partner.

19:38.243 --> 19:40.944
You know what we do to cheats
       in Dodge City, don't you?

19:41.011 --> 19:42.112
(whimpers)

19:42.180 --> 19:43.279
Up.

19:43.347 --> 19:45.415
You... Bang!

19:51.256 --> 19:53.323
All right! Yes!
          Yay, Buddy!

19:53.391 --> 19:55.492
ELAINE: That's the best...
          TONY: All right, Alex.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.528
He did it.

20:00.498 --> 20:01.632
Dog did it.

20:01.699 --> 20:03.867
(whimpers)

20:07.137 --> 20:10.240
That is the best
        dog trick ever.

20:10.308 --> 20:14.178
I've never seen
anything so convincing.

20:20.150 --> 20:21.619
Uh-oh.

20:30.428 --> 20:31.695
Buddy? Buddy!

20:34.098 --> 20:38.701
Buddy? Buddy.

20:38.769 --> 20:40.571
Good dog.
          (whimpers)

20:40.639 --> 20:42.873
Oh! Oh, Buddy!

20:44.475 --> 20:47.411
(laughing)

20:47.478 --> 20:49.079
You did it!
          You did it!

20:49.147 --> 20:51.515
(smooches, laughs)

20:51.582 --> 20:53.783
I'll be taking
cab 134, Lou.

20:53.851 --> 20:56.987
See you guys after
the shift for a beer.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.889
Come on, Buddy,
     we'll split the tips.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.099
What are you doing
back here?

21:09.166 --> 21:11.034
You still got four hours
left on your shift.

21:11.102 --> 21:13.136
Yeah, well,
      I'm quitting early.

21:13.204 --> 21:15.305
You're quitting early?!

21:15.373 --> 21:18.141
You know, Reiger,
      ever since I let you

21:18.209 --> 21:19.843
take that mutt in the cab,

21:19.910 --> 21:22.412
you been breaking rules
        right and left.

21:23.981 --> 21:26.049
Where is the old fleabag?

21:26.117 --> 21:28.051
He died.

21:31.689 --> 21:34.024
He died?

21:34.092 --> 21:37.561
You mean he
                died in the cab?

21:37.629 --> 21:39.997
No, Louie,
     he died at the vet's.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.866
He was asleep
in the cab and, uh...

21:42.934 --> 21:45.935
I stopped off to get myself
a cup of coffee

21:46.003 --> 21:48.739
and, uh, him a donut...

21:48.807 --> 21:52.309
And when he woke up,
    he didn't look too good,

21:52.377 --> 21:54.745
so I rushed him over
         to the vet's.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.980
And he died?

21:57.048 --> 21:58.782
Yeah.

21:58.849 --> 22:00.350
Oh. God.

22:00.418 --> 22:02.318
Oh...

22:02.386 --> 22:03.587
I don't know
                    what to say.

22:03.655 --> 22:04.855
I don't know
                     what to do.

22:04.922 --> 22:07.224
I'm so awkward in
               these situations.

22:09.060 --> 22:13.263
Um, uh, Reiger's
                got to be alone!

22:13.331 --> 22:15.199
Every-Everybody,
                    out of here.

22:15.266 --> 22:17.367
Come on, come on, let's
      show a little sensitivity.

22:17.435 --> 22:18.702
Get your butts
                    out of here!

22:18.770 --> 22:19.970
Come on. Come on.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.872
Come on, come on.
      Go on, go on, go on.

22:25.343 --> 22:26.776
Let me buy you a
                  cup of coffee.

22:26.844 --> 22:28.611
I have a cup of coffee.

22:28.679 --> 22:29.780
Well, let me give you
               the quarter back.

22:29.847 --> 22:31.548
I don't want your quarter.

22:31.616 --> 22:33.450
Let-Let me buy you
          another cup of coffee.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.617
Louie, please.

22:34.685 --> 22:35.985
I'm a big boy.

22:36.053 --> 22:37.821
It wasn't like he
was a human being.

22:37.888 --> 22:41.291
He was a dog; just a dog.
And the dog died.

22:41.358 --> 22:43.292
Yeah.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.063
All right.

22:46.130 --> 22:51.167
I'll go call them and
          get them back in here.

23:19.931 --> 23:21.865
(sniffles, cries)

23:38.182 --> 23:41.818
(theme song playing)

24:02.707 --> 24:04.140
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:04.208 --> 24:05.242
