01:38.480 --> 01:41.563
Okay, Max. Go search.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.847
Careful, Max.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.050
Coast clear?

02:21.560 --> 02:23.210
Good to go.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.120
- Sir, just move to the circle.
- All right, let's go.

02:27.320 --> 02:32.247
- Come on. Come on.
- Outside the door. Outside the door.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.647
All right. Back up. Back up.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.289
Why is it just a bunch of old people?
Where are the young studs?

02:56.400 --> 02:58.004
We have surveillance of this village.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.568
We know you're selling weapons
to the Taliban. Where is your supply?

03:24.040 --> 03:25.724
Calm down. Ma'am, calm down.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.402
Well, look what we have here.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.964
We hit the jackpot.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.808
Attaboy, Max. Attaboy.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.483
Mom, I know it's been
too long since we last talked.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.200
They doubled our patrols,
but it's paying off.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.483
Our battalion's never had a find
like this. We owe it all to Max.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.728
We're so proud of you both.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.524
Oh, you hear that, Max? Say "hi."

04:19.959 --> 04:22.122
- Hi. Can he see me?
- Yeah, of course he can, Mom.

04:22.360 --> 04:26.445
Come on. We're just an ocean of pixels
in a dog's eyes, Pam.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.450
- Hey, Dad. How you doing?
- I'm good, Kyle.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.610
- You shouldn't mess with your mother like that.
- Yes, sir. Sorry.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.088
- What'd y'all dig up over there?
- The usual. Just a lot more of it.

04:36.280 --> 04:40.046
You know, RPGs, AKs. A lot of Russian
junk left over from the '80s.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.881
I'd trade that M-4 for one of those
Russian AKs any day of the week.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.889
- I'll run that up the flagpole, sir.
- Well...

04:46.080 --> 04:49.926
Anyway, I think both of you
deserve a medal or something.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.886
Yeah. Kyle's so awesome,
even his fricking dog's a hero.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.367
Feet off the table.
No cussing in this house.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.171
- I didn't cuss.
- You can't hide the words in your mind...

04:59.400 --> 05:01.687
from God by switching letters
in your mouth.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.884
- You think he cares what I got in my mind?
- Hey. Cut it out.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.686
They ask me how I sleep so good
in a war zone.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.962
You can sleep
because I got your back, K-dog.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.884
- Well, hi.
- Hey, Tyler.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.282
You still wrestling
with that kitchen sink?

05:14.480 --> 05:16.403
Yeah, but I think it's about to tap out.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.047
- You boys keeping out of trouble?
- Still making trouble, Ms. W.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.403
- Now I'm just bringing it down on the bad guys.
- Hoorah.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.887
- Waste them all. Let God sort them out.
- Hey.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.811
- Hoorah.
- Boys, we need you to report to command.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.971
- Hey, Mom, I gotta go. Okay? I love you.
- Oh, all right.

05:33.160 --> 05:36.050
- Well, okay. Bye. We love you. Love you.
- Be safe.

05:36.240 --> 05:40.290
Justin, come say goodbye
to your brother.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.046
- Justin.
- Hey, Mom. Just leave him be, okay?

05:43.240 --> 05:45.129
I'm just dealing
with a minor insurgency.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.931
He's trying to save the whole universe.

05:49.760 --> 05:55.244
This is the weapons cache
your unit uncovered. Is that correct?

05:55.440 --> 05:59.001
- Yes, sir.
- And this is the field report.

05:59.200 --> 06:03.444
And there are several more weapons
in the photos than are listed in the report.

06:03.640 --> 06:06.803
- Not enough to set off alarm bells.
- This is not the first time...

06:07.000 --> 06:09.685
we've noted discrepancies
in your unit's field reports.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.764
After a while,
a trickle turns into a stream.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.169
Anything you want to tell us, Marine?

06:17.360 --> 06:19.328
I just handle the dog, sir.

06:21.120 --> 06:25.250
Sergeant Harne,
step inside, front and center.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.482
Sergeant Harne reporting, sir.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.891
Can you believe those office pogues
coming at us like that?

07:37.080 --> 07:40.527
- We're putting our lives on the line for them.
- Ty, this ain't fifth grade.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.516
I can't cover for you like that here.

07:42.616 --> 07:46.156
Until yesterday, I had no idea
what you were doing.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.200
You crossed the line.
Put the brakes on it or I will.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.046
- Kyle, it's me you're talking to.
- When are you gon...

07:59.920 --> 08:01.604
What's he got?

08:03.280 --> 08:09.003
- Wants us to stay put.
- No. We have our orders. Move him out.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.809
Max.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.049
- Everybody down!
- Take cover! Take cover!

08:34.280 --> 08:35.645
Max!

08:38.039 --> 08:39.962
Tyler!

08:44.240 --> 08:46.208
Tyler!

08:47.360 --> 08:50.728
- Smith, Rodrigues, with me!
- Henderson, March, go, go, go!

08:50.960 --> 08:53.440
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- I'm blind!

08:53.640 --> 08:56.120
All right, everybody, move up! Move up!

08:59.360 --> 09:01.044
Where's Wincott?

09:02.960 --> 09:05.008
- Sarge!
- I got him, I got him.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.929
Easy, Max.

09:11.800 --> 09:15.122
Easy. I got you, Max.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.527
All right. There's no security codes
or encryptions or anything like that on it.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.650
- Yeah, I get it. You're proud of your work, B.
- Whoa, whoa.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.844
I want an extra 200 for this one.
Okay? Tell Emilio that.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.883
- You said what?
- I heard he's selling...

09:45.080 --> 09:47.731
that "Assassin's Creed" I ripped
all the way in Austin.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.764
You don't want beef with my cousin.
You know what I'm saying?

09:50.960 --> 09:53.531
Look, man, 200 more
or this is gonna be the last one.

09:53.720 --> 09:58.931
Oh, hey, Mr. Wincott. Gotta go.
Be seeing you later, Justin. Peace out.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.129
Okay.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.442
Come here.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.122
- What are you doing?
- Hanging out.

10:15.320 --> 10:18.130
I thought I was gonna see you at work
this morning, 8 a.m.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.008
And waste my summer?
Sweeping floors for 8 bucks an hour?

10:23.200 --> 10:27.569
You'd rather sit in your room on your butt,
playing video games? That suit you better?

10:27.760 --> 10:30.141
It's better than renting
storage for junk...

10:30.241 --> 10:32.212
people should've thrown out
in the first place.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.006
That junk puts food in your mouth,
smart guy.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.964
And I don't just run it, I own it.

10:37.160 --> 10:41.245
A lot of people around here, they gotta
punch a time clock. I'm my own boss.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.164
- Yeah, well, you ain't mine.
- What's that?

11:06.240 --> 11:08.402
Stay here, Justin.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.925
Dad.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.250
- Stay here.
- Dad, what are they doing here?

11:14.480 --> 11:16.050
Dad.

11:24.040 --> 11:28.762
Nearer, my God, to thee

11:28.960 --> 11:34.763
Nearer to thee

11:35.000 --> 11:41.087
E'en though it be a cross

11:41.280 --> 11:47.367
That raiseth me

11:47.600 --> 11:52.447
Still all my song shall be...

11:56.040 --> 11:59.886
Nearer, my God, to thee

12:16.440 --> 12:18.647
Ma'am. Sir.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.770
Sorry I'm so late.
I trained your son and his dog at Maitland.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.681
They sent Max back for an eval. Figured
since we were only a short drive away...

12:25.880 --> 12:28.804
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:58.440 --> 13:04.766
Though like the wanderer

13:04.960 --> 13:10.330
The sun gone down

13:12.600 --> 13:14.523
We gotta go, Max. Come on.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.967
I'm sorry.
He was trained better than this.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.083
Come on, Max.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.884
I know how he feels.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.531
Max.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.720
Excuse me, son. Who might you be?

13:34.720 --> 13:37.291
It's Justin. Kyle's brother.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.207
I guess Max already figured that out.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.051
You wanna help us
get him back to the van?

13:43.240 --> 13:45.402
Might go a lot easier if you did.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.769
Thank you.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.520
Here comes the hard part.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.802
A lot to learn from there.

15:39.080 --> 15:43.449
- About what?
- About becoming a man.

15:43.640 --> 15:47.361
Enlisting? Getting killed like Kyle?

15:48.560 --> 15:52.007
Getting my leg shot up like you?
What would that prove?

15:52.200 --> 15:55.568
You speak of Kyle, you speak respectfully.
Do you understand me?

15:56.480 --> 15:59.609
He didn't have to prove anything
to anybody.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.486
You think Kyle wasn't trying
to prove himself to you?

16:03.680 --> 16:06.923
All Kyle ever did was try to prove himself
to you. And if he didn't...

16:07.120 --> 16:09.726
- bet he would have never joined.
- What would you know?

16:09.920 --> 16:12.241
You never sacrificed anything,
much less your life.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.010
- Guys.
- You'd like me to do that?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.651
Guys!

16:17.240 --> 16:18.730
They're gonna kill Max.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.249
Animals can come down with
post traumatic stress same as people can.

16:29.440 --> 16:33.650
Max bonded so closely with Kyle, it's proven
impossible to get him to follow orders...

16:33.880 --> 16:35.041
from anyone else.

16:35.240 --> 16:40.201
He can't handle sharp noises anymore,
gunshots, explosions send him into a panic.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.129
These dogs were bred to work.

16:42.320 --> 16:46.041
Take away that sense of purpose
and they're lost.

16:46.240 --> 16:50.802
Max can't serve here
and he's a danger everywhere else.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.008
Well, this family takes care of its own.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.571
How we doing, Max?

17:07.640 --> 17:09.368
Go on.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.131
Hey.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.325
Remember me?

17:19.920 --> 17:22.127
You sure you wanna do this?

17:22.920 --> 17:24.523
Yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.287
Okay. Slowly.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.329
No sudden moves.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.166
That's a cool toy. Right?

17:34.120 --> 17:37.124
How do I get him to sit?

17:37.360 --> 17:41.251
Better focus on giving him that kong while
keeping your hand attached to your wrist.

17:41.440 --> 17:45.286
I mean, like what... What do I do
with my hand to get him to...

17:45.680 --> 17:47.364
Sit.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.683
Sit.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.089
Good. Psycho hound.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.843
Good boy.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.805
Just enjoy that in peace.

18:16.720 --> 18:21.647
Okay, sergeant.
We'll be taking him home.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.567
Do we have to tie him up?
I feel bad for him.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.369
He's too unstable
to stay in the house...

18:28.560 --> 18:30.927
and I can't have him
running around loose.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.647
- Why don't we just build a fence?
- That's a great idea.

18:36.400 --> 18:40.371
- Easy, Max. Easy, easy. Easy.
- Who's gonna pay for it? You?

18:40.560 --> 18:42.050
No.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.766
If you do, I'll trick the neighborhood kids
into whitewashing it.

18:44.960 --> 18:49.204
- Ha, ha. You sure this one's ours?
- I got the stretch marks to prove it.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.887
- Here.
- Careful, honey.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.531
Okay. Well...

19:07.720 --> 19:09.802
let's you and me
go get this dog some dinner.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.121
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.529
I did not sign on
to babysit Kyle's crazy dog.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.767
Hey.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.130
Kyle's gone.
So this dog is officially your dog.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.761
Do you understand?

19:43.800 --> 19:47.930
Your brother loved you so much,
more than you'll ever know.

19:48.160 --> 19:51.846
If he did, he wouldn't have left me here
to deal with Dad all by myself.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.050
Your father loves you too.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.164
Just none of you Wincott boys
are very good at showing it.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.971
If you wanna buck that trend,
I sure could use a hug right about now.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.410
He'll tire himself out.

20:44.600 --> 20:50.209
That's what you said about Justin
and he hasn't quit barking yet.

20:50.400 --> 20:54.007
Justin! Get that dog to shut up!

20:59.560 --> 21:04.600
Hey. Hey. Dude, seriously,
this is how it's gonna be?

21:08.800 --> 21:12.521
Yeah. Okay. Sit.

21:13.680 --> 21:17.002
Easy, boy. Easy.

21:19.480 --> 21:23.166
Okay. Good boy.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.004
Right.

21:40.200 --> 21:44.046
Well, see you in the morning, I guess.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.243
What is wrong with you?

21:51.360 --> 21:54.091
- Justin!
- Oh, my God. Look, I'm trying!

21:54.280 --> 21:56.886
Shut that dog up before
I come out there with my .45!

21:57.120 --> 22:00.602
Man, come on over.
You'll be doing me a favor!

22:01.240 --> 22:03.447
What do you want, Max?

22:09.240 --> 22:14.246
What? What, do you want me to stay?
I can't stay out here all night.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.523
Sit. Sit.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.482
All right. Fine.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.565
Just till you fall asleep.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.606
Good morning.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.408
Sweetheart, good morning.

23:11.600 --> 23:16.447
I was looking all over for you.
You been out here all night?

23:16.640 --> 23:20.008
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Your friend called. What's his name? Chuy.

23:20.200 --> 23:23.010
He says it's urgent.
You gotta call him back.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.683
Oh. If you want me to start going
to the bathroom out here, I can do that too.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.605
Sounds good to me,
as long as you pick up after yourself.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.247
- Yo, Justin! What's up?
- Hey, Justin!

23:56.440 --> 23:58.283
Hey, what's up, dude?

24:00.440 --> 24:03.523
- Yo, half the bikes here are mountain.
- All right. Do a trick.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.404
- I just do trails.
- Heh. What trails, man?

24:05.600 --> 24:08.490
- I don't see you doing trails.
- Hey. Hey.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.887
Hey, what's up, man?
Yo, Justin, how you ride?

24:11.080 --> 24:14.687
- Like this?
- Yo, shut up, man.

24:14.880 --> 24:18.362
- Yo, sorry to call your house, but...
- Emilio was breathing down your neck?

24:18.600 --> 24:20.887
- Because you never gave him...
- Is this the new one?

24:21.080 --> 24:22.286
That's for Emilio.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.966
You took off like your pants were
on fire when my dad came out.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.050
- I don't mess with no war heroes, B.
- War heroes?

24:28.240 --> 24:31.608
I heard your pops got his leg shot up
in a crazy firefight in 'Nam.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.041
It was Iraq. But whatever.

24:34.280 --> 24:35.691
Yo, he was like:

24:40.520 --> 24:42.409
Cool under fire, huh?

24:43.720 --> 24:49.602
- No, we... It's like a, um...
- And that's my cousin, Carmen.

24:51.520 --> 24:55.286
Why you looking at me like that?
Think I should look like the maid?

24:55.480 --> 24:58.848
Should I be wearing an apron?
Or no, maybe overalls would be better, huh?

24:59.040 --> 25:00.166
Ooh.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.647
- You got a lot of cousins.
- Tell me about it.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.810
She's staying with us, man.
I can't even sit on my own couch, B.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.809
My uncle chased her out with a machete.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.321
Why you always making up stories
all the time?

25:10.520 --> 25:12.682
Wait, what happened?

25:12.880 --> 25:16.566
- Oh, yo, check it out.
- That's cool.

25:16.760 --> 25:21.402
We were at dinner. Pop told me
to have it removed or he'd do it for me.

25:21.600 --> 25:25.366
So I slid over my knife,
said, "Go ahead."

25:25.560 --> 25:30.407
He got up, called my aunt, told her
he didn't wanna see me anymore.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.126
So she said for me to come over.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.368
End of story.

25:37.560 --> 25:40.006
Trust me, machetes were involved.

25:40.200 --> 25:44.808
- Come on, B. Ride with us.
- No. I gotta go take care of that dog, so...

25:45.000 --> 25:47.890
Yo, your brother's war dog, right?
I heard he's loco, homes.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.721
My cousin Felix works up at the church,
said he tore up like 10 Marines.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.969
- Put them in the hospital.
- He didn't put anybody in the hospital.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.686
You got an MWD? What kind?

25:57.880 --> 25:59.928
- What kind?
- Your dog. What breed is he?

26:00.160 --> 26:01.207
Oh.

26:01.400 --> 26:07.442
Yeah, um. He's like a German shepherd.
Like black in his face.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.642
- Belgian Malinois.
- Mallen-what?

26:09.840 --> 26:11.410
Cool dog.

26:11.600 --> 26:16.162
He's crazy, actually. I'm the only one he'll
let near him. Won't even let me touch him.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.681
Just gotta be patient with him.
He'll come around.

26:18.880 --> 26:22.521
She's like the chick version of Cesar Millan.
Got the mustache and everything.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.171
Don't touch me.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.608
Hey. If you want, I can come over
and show you a few tricks.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.047
Ooh.

26:31.240 --> 26:34.130
Yeah, sure. Why not?

26:34.360 --> 26:37.807
How about later, so I can cook up
some treats? Say, 3:00?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.331
- Cool.
- Cool.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.966
- What just happened?
- You're stupid. That's what just happened.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.126
Hey. Easy.

27:11.320 --> 27:14.483
Yo. That dog reminds me of your pops.

27:14.680 --> 27:15.920
Maybe this was a bad idea.

27:19.120 --> 27:23.011
Pink Floyd.
You're one of those deep ones, huh?

27:23.240 --> 27:26.722
Hey, there, Max. Like some home cooking?
Smells nice, doesn't it?

27:26.920 --> 27:31.244
Hey, I wouldn't get too close to him.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.569
This is close enough for now.
Let him think about it for a minute.

27:34.760 --> 27:38.207
Yo, I'm out. Carmen,
you get bit, it ain't my fault, right?

27:38.400 --> 27:40.368
Hey, no, Chuy. You can stay if you want.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.370
- Not if your mean old man is around.
- He's at work, dude.

27:43.560 --> 27:47.565
That man ain't got no love for his light
brown brothers. Know what I'm saying?

27:47.760 --> 27:51.924
That's messed up. The way you let Chuy
hate on your dad like that.

27:52.120 --> 27:55.169
- That's cold.
- Are you serious?

27:55.400 --> 27:58.006
I can say whatever
I want about my old man.

27:58.200 --> 28:01.363
Someone else disrespects him,
go upside their head.

28:01.560 --> 28:04.166
- It's called being loyal.
- It's called being psycho...

28:04.360 --> 28:06.840
so you and Max
should get along pretty well.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.530
I'm not the one
he has to get along with.

28:12.630 --> 28:15.216
Don't give this to him
until he lets you touch him.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.289
So how'd you get to be such an expert
in all this? Do you have credentials or...

28:21.480 --> 28:24.609
You gonna eat that carnita
or are you gonna give it to your dog?

28:38.840 --> 28:41.320
- Don't do it, man!
- Chuy.

28:41.520 --> 28:45.525
- Ow. Are you trying to get my boy killed?
- Shut up, Chuy!

28:47.800 --> 28:52.203
- Maybe I should just give it to him first.
- No, it's a reward.

28:52.400 --> 28:56.291
You can't get a reward
if you didn't do anything to deserve it.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.450
Okay.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.608
It's a start. You got a leash?

29:20.360 --> 29:24.570
Heel. You don't let your dog walk you,
you walk your dog.

29:24.760 --> 29:28.970
Dogs run in packs so if he's leading you,
he's leading the pack.

29:29.200 --> 29:33.569
My brother said Max
was like a specialized search dog.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.684
He could go out in front of his handler
for like 300 yards.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.810
Locate weapons and explosives and stuff.

29:40.040 --> 29:44.204
Yo, we got the Air Jordan of dogs here, man.
You got him shooting layups?

29:44.400 --> 29:48.166
- Sorry, Chuy. Did you wanna try walking him?
- Heck, no. Are you crazy?

29:57.760 --> 30:00.809
Make sure to keep him
to your left a little bit.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.130
All right, Max, you're such a superstar,
let's see you work off-leash.

30:06.360 --> 30:13.005
I don't think it's a good idea. If something
happens, my dad will kill me, so...

30:13.240 --> 30:18.280
No guts, no glory.
Now walk with him like you were just doing.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.482
Heel, Max.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.531
Well, I do not believe what I'm seeing.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.361
- How'd you get him to do that?
- He already knew.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.289
We were just refreshing his memory.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.562
Mom, this is Carmen.
She's Chuy's cousin.

30:33.760 --> 30:37.401
- She's, uh, real good with dogs.
- Well, I can see that.

30:37.640 --> 30:40.041
- Nice to meet you, Carmen. Hi, Chuy.
- Ma'am.

30:40.240 --> 30:44.609
I was thinking that, you know,
we could just give Max to her.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.644
No such luck, Chuck. That's your dog.

30:47.840 --> 30:51.401
But I'm fixing to start supper.
If y'all are hungry, you're welcome to stay.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.001
Oh, thanks, ma'am. I'd be glad to.

30:54.240 --> 30:57.801
Thanks. I gotta go home, make sure
the border patrol hasn't invaded my house.

30:58.040 --> 31:01.681
I'll tell my moms gringos have kidnapped
my cousin. Y'all have fun.

31:02.680 --> 31:05.081
Everything's outstanding, Pam.
Thank you.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.521
Yeah, it's really good.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.646
Now, you guys know this is overcooked.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.446
I don't know what happened.
I've made it a hundred times.

31:15.680 --> 31:22.325
I put it in and Mary called.
You know how she can get. And, um...

31:24.480 --> 31:28.644
And I just forgot to take it out.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.528
You having fun yet?

31:37.400 --> 31:38.731
I'm so sorry.

31:39.400 --> 31:43.450
Carmen, we lost our oldest son recently
and, um...

31:44.120 --> 31:46.487
- Well...
- I'm really sorry.

31:46.680 --> 31:47.727
Thank you.

31:50.160 --> 31:53.084
Why don't you tell us
something about you?

31:53.280 --> 31:55.487
How'd you get to be so good
working with dogs?

31:55.720 --> 31:57.131
Oh, um...

31:57.320 --> 31:59.084
Well, my old ma...

31:59.280 --> 32:05.003
My father used to raise pit bulls.
And my brother trains them, so...

32:05.200 --> 32:08.010
Pit bulls?
Does he train them for dog fighting?

32:11.840 --> 32:13.922
My brother rescues strays.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.440
Well, you should see Carmen with Max.

32:17.640 --> 32:21.087
And she's showing Justin how to work
with him too. He's really coming along.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.883
I got it.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.803
My goodness. Wow. Look at you, kid.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.766
- All grown up. How you doing?
- Good.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.769
Can I come in?

32:42.960 --> 32:45.281
- Well...
- I hope it's okay I came by like this.

32:45.520 --> 32:48.046
- I've been home for a couple of days.
- Good to see you.

32:48.240 --> 32:51.164
Good to see you. Well...

32:53.160 --> 32:58.166
I just, uh... I wanted to tell you
how sorry I am.

32:58.360 --> 33:01.682
- Glad to see you.
- Me too.

33:01.880 --> 33:06.249
- You're back sooner than we expected.
- Yeah. Medical discharge.

33:06.440 --> 33:10.684
Got shrapnel all up and down my back.
Got a few pieces lodged in my spine.

33:10.920 --> 33:14.242
Man, makes us a couple
of beat-up old Marines, I guess.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.090
I'm proud to be one alongside you.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.009
You're back just in time for the 4th.

33:18.200 --> 33:21.727
And I'd really like to have you alongside me
marching in the parade.

33:21.920 --> 33:25.641
Doesn't it hurt?
All that metal in your back?

33:27.040 --> 33:32.843
Yeah. Uh, well, they got me on so many
meds, I hardly notice it. I'm sorry, you are?

33:33.040 --> 33:35.327
This is Carmen, Justin's friend.

33:35.520 --> 33:38.000
She's... Oh, you know what?

33:38.240 --> 33:41.323
I know somebody else
who'll be glad to see you. Come on.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.921
I'll put these in water
in just a minute.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.603
Here he is.

33:50.760 --> 33:51.841
Max.

34:01.880 --> 34:02.927
- Max, stay!
- Max!

34:03.120 --> 34:06.010
- Stay! Stay! Stay.
- Easy, Max! Max!

34:07.720 --> 34:10.199
Max! Easy. Easy, Max.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.011
I can't believe Max did that, you know?

34:37.480 --> 34:43.123
- I mean, after everything that you did with him.
- After everything we did.

34:43.320 --> 34:45.322
- He's your dog.
- Whatever.

34:49.440 --> 34:53.922
You know, dogs are usually
pretty good judges of character.

34:55.120 --> 34:58.329
Then I guess Max likes me pretty well.

34:58.520 --> 35:01.524
Yeah, well, even dogs can make mistakes.

35:01.720 --> 35:05.406
Hey, are you gonna be
at the, uh, bike park tomorrow?

35:05.600 --> 35:07.807
Wouldn't you like to know?

35:27.440 --> 35:29.010
Min! No, no, no.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.646
Come on, girl. No!

35:31.840 --> 35:34.047
Yo, Justin!

35:34.240 --> 35:36.481
Justin, got more chores
for you when you're done.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.763
- Yeah, come mow my lawn!
- After that, take my trash out!

35:39.960 --> 35:42.042
Woo-hoo!

35:48.320 --> 35:49.731
Right.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.644
Okay, sit. Max, sit.

36:01.360 --> 36:07.129
Max, you mess up now,
you're grounded for life. You understand?

36:27.240 --> 36:31.165
My God. Come on, Max.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.960
That's it? No tricks? Flips?

36:51.160 --> 36:53.049
Well, how about you do it?

36:53.240 --> 36:54.366
Hey, Max.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.204
What are you doing off-leash?

36:56.440 --> 36:58.283
You in a better mood today or something?

36:58.520 --> 37:02.047
Yo, Justin, I was gonna call you,
but I didn't want to be calling your house.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.250
Get a cell, join the 21 st century.

37:05.880 --> 37:09.487
Ooh. Look at you, girl,
making googly-eyes at that white boy.

37:09.680 --> 37:13.526
- Being a traitor to your race.
- Mexican isn't a race, stupid.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.162
Whoa. You shouldn't be
bringing him out like this.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.842
Heard he tore up your brother's homie.
Had his teeth up at his throat like:

37:22.880 --> 37:24.928
Chuy, sometimes I wish I could be you...

37:25.120 --> 37:28.090
so the world would seem so awesome
all the time.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.045
It is awesome, B.
Y'all just got a bad attitude.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.402
Crazy awesome things
are happening all the time.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.608
- Oh, yeah?
- Yo, Justin!

37:35.800 --> 37:38.565
- We're hitting Cutter's Run.
- Yeah.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.445
- Come on, man.
- I'll catch up in a second.

37:41.640 --> 37:45.964
- You're gonna catch up to those guys?
- Yeah. Why not?

37:46.200 --> 37:50.728
- What about Max?
- Try and keep up.

37:58.960 --> 38:02.487
It looks like homegirl don't know
my boy Justin too good yet.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.170
I know your boy has problems.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.642
Chores are over, y'all!

39:16.400 --> 39:17.925
Whoa. Aah!

39:37.200 --> 39:40.409
- Yo, Justin, that's Cutter's Doom!
- What's Cutter's Doom?

39:54.800 --> 39:56.370
Justin!

40:06.240 --> 40:07.685
Whoo!

40:10.400 --> 40:11.765
- Crazy white boy!
- What?

40:11.960 --> 40:13.883
Even your dog has more sense than you.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.048
I can't hear you.
Come down here and tell me.

40:17.240 --> 40:20.767
Crazy, B! Justin...

40:21.120 --> 40:23.202
Ow! Girl, that hurts.

40:23.440 --> 40:26.649
Whoo!

40:48.960 --> 40:50.928
Hey, Mom.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.851
What, uh... What's that?

40:54.200 --> 40:59.764
Your father put it there while you were gone.
He does not want to argue with you about it.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.928
Who's arguing?

41:02.120 --> 41:04.487
Didn't want Max here in the first place,
remember?

41:09.120 --> 41:12.841
Go on. Max. Max, you heard me. Go on.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.287
Oh, heh.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.007
Max!

43:48.600 --> 43:51.729
Max, it's okay. It's okay.
Easy. Easy, boy. Easy. Shh.

43:51.920 --> 43:56.687
It's okay. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.
It's okay. Easy. It's okay.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.803
Hey. Come on. Come on. Come inside.

44:00.880 --> 44:02.530
Easy.

44:05.240 --> 44:09.165
Hey. Hey. Come on. Come on. Come on, Max.
Hey, let's go inside. Let's go inside.

44:10.800 --> 44:13.371
Come on. Let's go inside.
Hey, shh, it's okay.

44:13.560 --> 44:16.131
Max, hey. Hey, hey, Max.

44:17.400 --> 44:22.691
Hey, Max. It's okay.
I'm coming in, Max. Okay?

44:22.880 --> 44:25.565
I'm coming in. It's okay.

44:35.920 --> 44:37.968
It's okay. It's okay.

44:45.080 --> 44:47.162
It's okay. Easy, easy.

44:51.560 --> 44:54.291
It's all right. It's all right.
It's okay.

44:57.360 --> 44:58.850
It's okay.

45:15.800 --> 45:19.691
So we got 25 8-by-10 units over here...

45:19.880 --> 45:23.441
and we got 20 6-by-12 units
over on the other side of the lot.

45:23.960 --> 45:27.726
Running at about half capacity
right now. Hard times.

45:29.560 --> 45:33.360
It's not much compared
to the uniform you're used to.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.961
- I'll be proud to wear it.
- Yeah.

45:36.160 --> 45:39.926
Tyler, the truth is
there's not much to this job.

45:40.120 --> 45:43.090
I mean, especially for a young man
with your skill set.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.089
You're gonna be bored out of your mind.

45:45.280 --> 45:49.171
Thank you, sir,
but it doesn't mix with my meds.

45:49.360 --> 45:52.967
Excitement's about the last thing I need.
Little boredom suits me just fine.

45:53.160 --> 45:56.164
That's why I came to you about the job
in the first place.

45:56.360 --> 45:59.284
- No offense intended.
- None taken.

45:59.960 --> 46:05.171
So I heard your old man's
over there in Tucson these days.

46:05.400 --> 46:10.486
- Yeah, he just finished a stint at state.
- Sorry about that.

46:10.680 --> 46:13.445
Three squares a day,
the way he likes it.

46:13.640 --> 46:17.247
You know, if you need a place to stay,
we can fix up that old spare room.

46:17.440 --> 46:21.365
Oh, no. I'm crashing with some buddies.
You've already given me more than I deserve.

46:21.560 --> 46:25.201
I just wish there was something
I could do for you in return.

46:25.760 --> 46:29.481
Well, you know, maybe there is.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.841
- I need to know.
- Know what, sir?

46:35.880 --> 46:37.325
How my son died.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.610
Sir, Kyle was the best friend
that I ever had, okay?

46:45.800 --> 46:51.842
- He was the bravest Marine that I ever knew.
- Tyler.

46:56.720 --> 47:02.443
We were out on that last patrol,
looking for a hajji cache of arms...

47:05.320 --> 47:08.130
and that's when it hit the fan.

47:08.320 --> 47:14.168
RPGs going off, bullets flying, you name it.
It was like hell on earth.

47:14.360 --> 47:16.931
- And, well, sir, the dog lost it.
- The dog?

47:17.120 --> 47:20.488
Yes, sir. You know how Kyle was,
he was trying to keep him calm...

47:20.680 --> 47:22.603
when he should have been taking cover.

47:22.800 --> 47:25.963
Then it went for him,
made him lose control of his weapon.

47:26.160 --> 47:28.322
The next thing I knew Kyle was hit.

47:28.520 --> 47:33.048
The dog come at me next, some of the guys
came in and stopped me from doing...

47:33.280 --> 47:35.328
what I should have did.

47:37.560 --> 47:39.688
I'm so sorry.

47:40.800 --> 47:42.643
Sir.

47:48.560 --> 47:53.122
- You did the best you could.
- Thank you, sir.

47:56.480 --> 47:58.687
I appreciate it.

48:02.880 --> 48:07.920
Well, I'd just as soon be alone now.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.527
Come on, Max.
Let's you and me get in the truck.

49:03.760 --> 49:07.890
Come on. Come on!

49:09.560 --> 49:12.086
Don't make me do this here, Max.

49:13.040 --> 49:17.762
- Dad.
- Go back in the house, Justin.

49:17.960 --> 49:20.281
What are you doing with that gun?

49:20.480 --> 49:23.723
This dog turned on your brother
and got him killed.

49:23.920 --> 49:27.720
- Says who?
- Tyler. He was there.

49:30.200 --> 49:33.170
Dad, Max wouldn't do that.

49:33.400 --> 49:36.722
Justin, you don't know anything
about this animal.

49:38.440 --> 49:40.408
I knew Kyle.

49:41.480 --> 49:44.802
Kyle would not have put
his buddies' lives on the line...

49:45.040 --> 49:47.168
by taking point with a dog
he couldn't trust.

49:48.480 --> 49:52.530
Ray. What is going on out here?

49:53.800 --> 49:55.484
Dad.

50:11.600 --> 50:15.002
He screws up one time, just one time...

50:15.600 --> 50:17.648
he's gonna get put down.

50:17.840 --> 50:19.763
Do you understand me?

50:21.640 --> 50:23.881
That's the last word on it.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.206
Son.

50:53.160 --> 50:54.730
- Justin. Hey.
- Hey.

50:54.920 --> 50:56.206
- Good to see you.
- You too.

50:56.440 --> 50:58.647
- How are your folks doing?
- Good. Good.

50:58.840 --> 51:00.649
How is Max?

51:00.920 --> 51:04.891
Um, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

51:05.120 --> 51:08.408
Max was as good a dog
as ever passed through this facility. Why?

51:09.600 --> 51:13.764
You think he could have,
like, hurt Kyle in any way?

51:14.000 --> 51:17.925
Dogs can bite their handlers, but I don't
think that's what you're asking me.

51:20.800 --> 51:24.361
I don't know. I mean,
could he have, like, turned on him?

51:24.600 --> 51:28.810
In the middle of a battle
or a firefight or something?

51:29.920 --> 51:33.083
What would make you think
something like that?

51:35.040 --> 51:39.170
My brother's friend Tyler.
He was with him when he died.

51:39.400 --> 51:45.726
And he came home recently. I don't know,
I guess he told my dad some stuff about Max.

51:47.520 --> 51:50.046
- Tyler Harne?
- Yeah.

51:50.240 --> 51:52.846
Did he tell your dad
why he was home five months early?

51:53.080 --> 51:55.651
I don't know, I mean,
I guess he got hurt or something.

51:55.880 --> 51:58.201
- That's what he said.
- Or something.

51:58.400 --> 52:01.882
Administrative separation.
It doesn't say anything about an injury.

52:02.080 --> 52:03.320
Uh...

52:04.000 --> 52:05.525
Are you saying he lied?

52:05.760 --> 52:07.888
Well, that's all I could get here. Yeah.

52:08.080 --> 52:10.242
I'll look into it. In the meantime...

52:13.920 --> 52:15.001
This is classified.

52:15.560 --> 52:19.406
- So don't get me in trouble, okay?
- Okay.

52:19.600 --> 52:21.125
For your eyes only.

52:21.760 --> 52:24.286
- So, what is it?
- It's top secret, okay?

52:24.480 --> 52:26.847
Hey, no one else can see this.

52:27.080 --> 52:28.491
All right, give it already.

52:29.200 --> 52:31.521
Yo, check out these Mexican dogs, man.

52:31.720 --> 52:34.690
Be thinking 10 small dudes
can take down one big one.

52:34.920 --> 52:36.922
It's probably some
kind of military dog...

52:37.120 --> 52:38.849
training instructions so...

52:39.040 --> 52:40.121
That's top secret?

52:40.320 --> 52:43.164
I'll tell al Qaeda the Army
feeds our dogs Kibbles 'n Bits.

52:43.360 --> 52:45.203
Be the end of America.

52:45.640 --> 52:46.926
You haven't watched it yet?

52:47.120 --> 52:49.361
No. I figured I should
watch it with someone...

52:49.600 --> 52:51.967
who could make head or tail of it.

52:52.160 --> 52:54.925
Justin, there's no big secret to this.

52:55.120 --> 52:58.602
Max just has to know that you want him,
and there's no faking it.

52:58.800 --> 53:01.610
Or are you one of those guys
who uses his dog to pick up girls?

53:04.240 --> 53:07.847
That's the sound of the third wheel
squeaking, yo. This is my house, remember?

53:08.040 --> 53:10.520
I'm sorry to interrupt
your important activities...

53:10.720 --> 53:14.088
like hiding in your room
and stalking girls on Instagram.

53:14.280 --> 53:17.284
Y'all two are making me throw up
in my own mouth.

53:17.480 --> 53:19.721
I'm gonna be out back.

53:21.240 --> 53:22.287
Let's check it out.

53:22.480 --> 53:23.970
Sit. Sit.

53:24.160 --> 53:28.165
- Welcome to training school, Max.
- There we go.

53:28.360 --> 53:30.249
Yeah, he's definitely
got some potential.

53:31.680 --> 53:35.765
Come on. Yeah, good boy.
Good boy. Come on.

53:35.960 --> 53:39.009
- Lead him on, lead him on.
- All right. Here it is.

53:39.200 --> 53:41.168
Ready, go. Up!

53:41.400 --> 53:44.324
- Oh, man, bad hop.
- You got to get over that.

53:45.560 --> 53:47.801
- Here we go, here we go!
- Let him go!

53:48.000 --> 53:51.846
- Good boy. Why don't you give it a shot?
- Yes, sir.

53:52.080 --> 53:55.801
Sit. Good. Good boy.

53:56.040 --> 53:59.761
- Good job.
- Down. Down. Good boy, Max.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.411
- Is that your brother?
- Yeah.

54:01.600 --> 54:05.730
Come. Sit. Good boy. Down.

54:05.920 --> 54:08.048
- If you want, I can go out back.
- It's okay.

54:08.240 --> 54:10.129
- Come. Hold.
- You can stay.

54:10.320 --> 54:12.288
Too quick. Sit.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.365
Looks like you earned his trust.

54:15.680 --> 54:18.001
Congratulations, Wincott.

54:18.280 --> 54:21.363
- Max is your responsibility now.
- Thank you, sir.

54:21.560 --> 54:23.642
Come on, come on. Jump! Good boy!

54:23.840 --> 54:26.411
Good job. There we go.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.125
- All right.
- Yeah.

54:28.680 --> 54:31.843
Go search, come on. Search.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.569
Good boy. Search. Search.

54:34.760 --> 54:37.331
Max. Search. Search.

54:39.160 --> 54:41.367
Good boy. Come on. Dig it out of there!

54:41.560 --> 54:44.291
Max, come on. Good boy. Dig. Good boy.

54:45.920 --> 54:47.968
Too fast for me, buddy.

54:48.160 --> 54:53.803
And up! Up! Up! Up! Up!

54:54.440 --> 54:57.410
Good boy. Yeah.

54:57.640 --> 54:59.085
You got to film my break?

54:59.280 --> 55:02.648
You're supposed to film us
working hard. Right, Max?

55:07.320 --> 55:10.881
Good work today, bud. Good work.

55:11.840 --> 55:14.446
I should have picked
a shady spot, buddy.

55:15.360 --> 55:16.850
Get out of that sun.

55:17.920 --> 55:21.208
- He's a liar.
- Who's a liar?

55:21.400 --> 55:25.485
Yo, Justin. Better come outside.

55:25.680 --> 55:29.605
No, no, no. Listen, I don't wanna hear
any excuses. Just get my money.

55:29.840 --> 55:32.366
Yeah, whatever. Just get my money.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.525
Bye.

55:35.280 --> 55:37.044
Well, well, well.

55:37.240 --> 55:40.528
Just making the rounds
and look who turns up. Heh.

55:40.720 --> 55:44.042
You know, would have never found
your brother around these parts.

55:44.600 --> 55:47.206
I'm sorry to hear about Kyle, though.
Semper fi.

55:47.440 --> 55:51.126
He was the only dude on the wrestling squad
that was able to take me down.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.328
Tried to get him to do business with me.

55:53.520 --> 55:57.286
He turned me down cold. I have a feeling
we would have beefed if he came back...

55:57.480 --> 56:01.610
so I guess
it's for the best, right? Right?

56:02.800 --> 56:05.406
- If you say so.
- I do say so.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.728
You got some big cojones
asking for that...

56:07.960 --> 56:12.329
- extra 200 bills for that game you ripped.
- If it ain't worth it, just don't buy it.

56:13.680 --> 56:14.727
You hear that, Chuy?

56:14.920 --> 56:17.446
You could pick up some attitude
from this kid.

56:18.360 --> 56:20.010
Who's this Morticia-looking mamita?

56:20.200 --> 56:21.645
That's my cousin Carmen.

56:21.840 --> 56:24.127
- Your cousin?
- Yeah, on my mom's side.

56:24.320 --> 56:25.731
Hey, how about you go, like...

56:25.920 --> 56:28.810
fix your makeup or go put
on a dress or something?

56:31.960 --> 56:33.564
Hey, what's up, Tyler?

56:34.640 --> 56:36.130
Yeah, don't trip.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.243
My people are gonna be there, yeah.

56:38.440 --> 56:40.681
I'm on my way. Bye.

56:41.600 --> 56:43.568
"Total Combat 4"
comes out next Thursday.

56:43.760 --> 56:46.081
You rip that for me at regular rate
and we're good.

56:46.280 --> 56:47.725
Otherwise, we're gonna have a problem.

56:50.240 --> 56:51.765
I heard about you.

56:51.960 --> 56:55.089
You tore up that squad of Navy SEALs
over at First Baptist.

56:55.880 --> 56:57.450
Nice.

56:58.400 --> 56:59.731
Get me that game.

57:01.680 --> 57:03.523
Hey, up... Up front.

57:16.240 --> 57:17.321
By Friday.

57:22.360 --> 57:23.725
Ow! What's that for?

57:23.960 --> 57:25.405
Why'd you let him disrespect me?

57:25.600 --> 57:29.082
- I didn't hear Justin say anything.
- He happened to be making the rounds?

57:29.280 --> 57:32.250
- You told him I was coming.
- He's been on me about that game, yo.

57:32.840 --> 57:35.081
Thanks for everything.
I'll call you tomorrow.

57:35.280 --> 57:37.089
You would if you had a phone, fool.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.210
All right, Max. Let's see
what you can do. Go search.

58:20.840 --> 58:22.604
What happened, boy? Did you lose him?

59:28.680 --> 59:32.401
Hey, hey. Shh. Shh.

59:41.400 --> 59:44.722
He likes it. Just wants to make sure
you have more than this one RPK-74.

59:44.920 --> 59:47.321
Tell him this is strictly show and tell.

59:49.680 --> 59:51.967
- Where are the rest?
- It's stored in a safe place.

59:52.160 --> 59:54.367
We'll deliver it
when half the agreed-on sum...

59:54.560 --> 59:56.050
is deposited into my account.

59:56.240 --> 59:59.961
You can tear up a chopper with this.
But if you really wanna take down a bird...

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.242
Go get the RPG.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.571
Hey.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.605
Hey, hey. Shh.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.249
What's going on?

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.727
Probably some critter.
Coyote or something.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.441
Your boy's good, Emilio?

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.211
He'll wire the money in the morning.
Don't set him up.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.807
Ain't nobody setting nobody up.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.365
Send them out.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.209
That's no coyote.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.285
You all right, boy?

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.407
What's the matter?

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.243
Loki, you gone nuts?!

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.687
That's definitely no coyote.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.810
Hey, Max.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.127
You scared me, boy.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.728
Come on. Come on, Max. Come on.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.128
Sit. Sit.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.805
- Are y'all okay?
- No, my dog's hurt and we need a ride.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.601
- Get him in the back. We'll take him to the vet.
- Thank you.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.805
Come on, let's go.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.400
Ma'am, can I, uh...
Can I borrow your phone?

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.802
Four hundred and fifty dollars?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.925
Max is okay and that's what matters.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.841
- Four hundred and fifty dollars?
- And 47 cents.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.804
For shots for a dog?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.844
Man, what you guys charge
for a person, yo? A million dollars?

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.088
How much money did your mom give you?

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.080
Give me? She didn't give me jack.
This $100 is my life savings.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.850
Your life savings is $100?

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.003
You don't want it?

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.487
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.967
Sorry. We can't release Max
without full payment.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.810
I'm gonna have to call your parents.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.002
Please, ma'am, I'm good for the rest.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.000
Just give me time to think about
what I'm gonna tell my dad.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.690
Thank you.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.762
What am I gonna tell my dad?

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.124
If this has anything to do
with Emilio, nothing.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.084
I can't do that. Dude.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.369
Bro, this man's loco.
Family don't mean dirt to him.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.928
If you care about me and Carmen,
then leave us out of it.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.681
Come on, Max.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.804
Hey, come on. Let's go.
Let's get in the cage, come on.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.085
Max, hey, come on. Hey.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.329
Get some rest, Max.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.601
- There he is.
- Mom?

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:24.089
Hi. Justin, come on in. Come on in, now.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.044
Look at you.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.642
Justin, what have you done?

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.607
Done?

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.088
Tell the truth, Justin.
Don't you dare lie.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.409
Ma'am, if I may...

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.682
Now, I was just having
a few off-duty beers...

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.450
with my buddy Tyler here when...

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.165
Wham!

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.330
My dog didn't know what hit him.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.887
Got me pretty good too.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.327
Now, that's assault.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.522
I mean, I'm willing
to drop all charges...

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.843
if you go ahead
and put him down yourselves.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.849
Truth is, he'll be put down regardless.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:03.284
Max wasn't anywhere near you
or your dog. Mom, I mean...

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:06.845
Found this out near my place.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.767
It's your bike, ain't it? Hmm?

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.007
Well...

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.164
Ms. Wincott.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:26.002
How about me and you have
a few words in private, hmm? Man to man?

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.444
You know what this is?

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.089
It's a Beretta M9.
Built-in laser sight, the works.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.285
Do you know how much it's worth?
About $600 here at the mall.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:56.605
Now guess what it's worth over the border.
A shade over three grand.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.690
You see, Kyle wouldn't give Emilio
the time of day...

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.168
but I do business with him
and so do you.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.530
That's right. We found out
about your deal on our last leave.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.611
Kyle was gonna tell your dad too,
but I talked him out of it.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.764
Hey, that's word of honor.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.287
We're more alike
than you and your brother were.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.721
Why don't you just leave Max out of it?

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:25.003
If it were up to me, believe me, I would.
But Stack's steaming mad.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.804
I ain't getting downwind of it.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.764
And, hey, you shouldn't either.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.128
That's a bad man down there.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.762
And them cartel dudes we're
in business with are even worse.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.487
Do you want a front row seat
at a couple more family funerals?

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.729
That's right.
Stack knows where you live.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:48.845
Things go wrong, you think he'll be shy
about telling those guys who's responsible?

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.330
Your mom and dad
are family to me, Justin.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:59.008
So do us all a favor
and keep your mouth shut.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:05.644
Did Kyle know about your business?

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.328
My business.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.890
I'm just a small fish in a big pond.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.450
Okay? The big fish sell weapons
all over the world...

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.768
and then send wide-eyed hicks like me...

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.685
and your brother over there
so we can get shot and killed by them...

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.764
so they can cry their crocodile tears,
salute the flag...

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.968
and then sell some more.

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.810
Kyle always wanted to be a hero.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.363
Look where it got him.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:02.529
Now, you see, me, I'm a realist.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.688
I know the way the world turns.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.087
Which one are you gonna be?

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:24.370
Come on. Come on.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.921
Max, hey. You don't deserve this, okay?

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.962
I know. I just...

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.328
I don't have a choice.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.007
Thanks, Ray, I'll see you later.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.041
Sorry I'm late.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.686
It's all right. Pam called.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.566
I just thought I'd hang out
a little bit longer, kind of cool down.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.285
- Can't say as you didn't warn me.
- Yeah.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.491
Hey, did you rent out 17-B?

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.761
Seventeen-B.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.804
Yeah, there's a lock on the door
and I don't have an invoice.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.321
That's mine.
I mean, it's a friend of mine's.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.682
I'm letting him keep his stuff there
for a couple days.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:38.929
- I should have asked.
- That's all right. We're all friends here.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.929
He can keep his stuff in there.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.488
Just come in, fill out the paperwork
and pay what's due.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.850
Hey, Mr. Wincott. Ray.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.725
Every kid gets in a spot of trouble
now and again.

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.536
Hello, you've reached the Wincotts.
Please leave a message.

01:11:35.706 --> 01:11:38.850
We'll call you back as soon
as we can. Thank you.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.611
Mr. Wincott, Mrs. Wincott,
this is Sergeant Reyes.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.848
Please call me at your earliest...

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.761
Harne's service record is protected
by privacy laws, but I talked to some people.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.644
- I wanna tell your folks about...
- No.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.569
I'm talking about some bad business.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.491
No one could prove Harne's involvement,
but he got busted...

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.401
If you talk to my dad, I'm gonna tell
your higher-ups about that training disc.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.011
Justin, are you all right?

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.441
I'll say you gave me
more classified stuff I threw away...

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.847
because I was afraid
of getting in trouble.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.520
Okay? I'll swear it.
Don't ever call here again.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.249
Come on, boy.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.531
Easy, easy!

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.367
Come on, come on!

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.767
Get him in there!

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.407
Whoa, whoa. Watch out!

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.486
Whoa!

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.847
What's on your mind, Ray?

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:21.086
Something just isn't sitting right.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:25.129
That deputy's place is way out there
in the middle of nowhere.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.721
What would Justin and Max
be doing out there, Pam?

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.169
I don't know, Ray.
I told you, he wouldn't talk to me.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.607
If you wanna know
what's going on with Justin...

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.207
I think it's time you ask him yourself.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.726
I've been keeping the peace between you two
since the day Kyle left this house.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.204
We already lost one son, Ray.

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.370
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to hold on to the other.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.608
Justin.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.930
Is there anything you wanna tell me
about what happened today?

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.047
- I'm sorry.
- That's not what I meant.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.365
I've seen you start trouble before...

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.404
but I've never seen you do anything
other than own up to it.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.441
I don't know, Dad,
I guess I'm just not a hero...

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.250
like you and Kyle.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.848
Just the way the world turns.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:51.361
In '91, my unit got deployed
to Saudi Arabia.

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.643
I'd just made sergeant.
It was my first command.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.769
I was excited.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.803
That first night, we went into Kuwait.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.210
We were about an hour in and we started
taking fire from our right flank.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.805
The guy next to me got hit
and he went down.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.686
I went to help him and I got hit. Twice.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.442
One through the muscle
and one shattered the bone.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:23.565
Turned out it was our own guys.
Friendly fire.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.970
I got medevac'd to Germany
and the war was over so fast...

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.527
most of the guys got home before I did.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.963
I got back,
there were some crazy stories.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.002
At first, I tried
to straighten people out...

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.807
but they just looked so disappointed.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.971
They didn't want to hear the truth.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.484
They wanted a hero.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.767
And so I stopped correcting them
sooner than I'd like to admit.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.410
I wanted to tell Kyle.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.885
I wanted him to know the truth.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.601
The way that he looked at me.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.450
The way that he looked up to me.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.082
I just couldn't do it.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:20.089
A hero always tells the truth...

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:25.002
no matter what people think about him
or what the consequences are.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.404
And you've always been that way.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:33.084
So if there's anything different
that happened today...

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.487
from what Tyler and that deputy
are saying...

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.770
I need you to tell me about it, son.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.530
Dad...

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.007
I think I'm gonna go to sleep now.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.130
Ray?

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.684
Now, you said this was a safe place
for us to store the merch.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.565
It was, okay, but Wincott
started getting nosy.

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.808
Look, the ridge
is an isolated enough spot...

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.571
to keep us under the radar
till the pickup tomorrow night.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:36.489
Tyler, I wanna talk to you.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.966
What's going on here?

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.448
We're just moving my friend's stuff out,
like you said.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.324
Deputy.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.002
You two seem to be spending
a lot of time together lately.

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:51.928
Is this the beast that Max
supposedly chewed up today?

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.690
That was his brother.

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:56.008
He got bit so bad,
I had to put him down.

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.521
- You put him down?
- That's right.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.688
Not Max.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.050
What do you got in those crates?

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.124
You know, just odds and ends.
Nothing to concern yourself with.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.403
Now, this is my property
so it is my concern. Which means...

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.251
Which means you should have stayed home.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.481
You know, Ray, I'd like to know
what's going on. Yeah.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.049
Justin! Justin! Hurry, please.

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.130
What did you and your father talk about?

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.926
- Nothing.
- After you talked about nothing, he left...

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:35.408
without a word and he just called
to say he was spending the night...

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.564
at our hunting cabin and not to worry.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.091
We have a hunting cabin?

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.329
No, we do not have a hunting cabin.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.804
Max.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.731
Max.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.561
Hey. Hey.

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.524
How'd you get home, buddy?

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:03.885
I'll be damned.

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.762
Come on, boy, let's go.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.088
Oh, honey, I feel like
I should go in with you.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.250
If you come, they won't
tell me anything. I'll be right back.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.767
Yo, I told you she was hairy, B.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.282
- What are you doing here waking my family up?
- Chuy, keep it down...

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.847
or I'm gonna come out there
and shut you up.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.610
Come on, let's talk outside.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.450
Okay, what's up?

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:37.920
Hey, guys, what's going on?

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.844
So my dad's MIA right now.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.242
He left a really weird message
and disappeared.

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:43.885
- You call the cops?
- My mom did.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.004
They won't do jack until he's gone
a lot longer than two hours.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.931
- I told her you knew something about it.
- So you lied on us.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.849
No, it's on me, Carmen, okay?

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.408
I just came because I need a bike
and a five minute head start.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.405
All right. So then let's do this.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.529
Carmen, this doesn't involve you, okay?

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.725
Are you gonna waste time on an argument
you'll lose or are you gonna get on that bike?

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.684
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold there. You can't have my bike, B.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.564
Because I'm gonna be riding it.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.331
Yo, Third Wheel,
you expecting Justin to walk?

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.963
This is my big brother's
prize ride, man.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.049
You mess this sucker up, I'm toast.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.321
Thanks, man.

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.330
All right, let's take the back way.
Just try and keep up.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.087
All right. We ditch his ride here.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.886
- From here on out, we go off-road.
- What about him?

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.645
Uh...

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.525
I had it handled, Emilio.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.642
Now he's a hostage
until we make the exchange.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.611
Once we do, you're gonna
take him over the border...

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.002
and see that he's never
heard from again.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.965
- Do you got it?
- Got it.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.886
No, I don't think so.
You ride in the doghouse.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.562
- What's in there?
- I don't know.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.891
Did you find something, boy?

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:45.283
Hey, I found this on the floor.

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.449
What is that?

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.450
It's my dad's holster. Max.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.569
Go search.

01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.410
Man, that dog is fast, yo.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.041
Then pedal faster, Third Wheel.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.691
Oh, my God.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.847
What's going on here?

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.451
- Ms. Wincott?
- Yes.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.484
Your dog escaped from the pound.
Any chance he came back here?

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:15.806
My dog?

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.329
I reported my husband missing...

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.842
and I was told he's not
officially missing for 48 hours.

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.286
We are aware of that call.

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:27.848
But my dog's gone and you're gonna
tear up the town trying to find him?

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:30.285
That's the law.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:37.082
I must have been crazy
to let you take Max from our house.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:40.523
Max is with my son and his friends,
God knows where.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:44.401
Why don't you go try to find them
and bring them home safely?

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.961
Max is part of our family now...

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.482
and if you so much as harm
one hair on his head...

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:55.242
I will see to it that you
and your entire department regret it.

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:57.929
That's my law.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:13.689
Oh, man.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.323
Hey, Dad?

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.882
Hey, Dad?

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.046
You having second thoughts?

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.045
My second thoughts
are having second thoughts.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.081
What about the kid?

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:03.489
Sooner or later, he's gonna
put two and two together.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.688
How far we planning on taking this?

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.089
When a Marine hits the beach,
he never stops and he never looks back.

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.807
You're not a Marine.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.884
Oh, man, he's not gonna do
what I think he's gonna do.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.731
Why you looking at me? I'm with the dog.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.244
Whoa. This water's cold, B.

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.644
Hope you guys know how to swim
if it gets deep.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.763
I can swim.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.722
When'd you ever swim?

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.884
It's just something you know, man.

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.490
Careful, yo, it's getting deep here.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.202
If Max can do it, then we can...

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:57.287
Justin.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.730
- Your brother's bike.
- Don't worry about it, I got it.

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.604
I got it.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.644
I'm okay, Max, I'm okay.

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.330
Thank you.

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.640
Yeah. Just don't expect me to lick
your face and we're good.

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.966
Looks like you found the sweet spot.

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.642
We are not going back for Chuy's bike.

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:55.562
This was a bad idea.

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.887
You think?

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.291
Let's go see
what's at the top of that rise.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.241
Emilio. Hey.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.802
What's going on?
Yeah, hold on a second. Yeah, what's up?

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.483
Hey, hey, hey. Shh, shh, shh. Be quiet.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.569
That sounds good. Sounds good.

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.410
We're good to go.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.170
Hey. My dad's in the truck
with a couple of bad guys.

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.170
There's a highway over there
and Emilio's down there too.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:02.648
We need to get to that highway,
get someone to call a cop or something.

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.370
How about a bunch of Navy SEALs?

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.642
I'm not gonna leave here
without my dad, okay?

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.486
I'm gonna stay here with Chuy,
you go get help, okay?

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.405
I am not seeing this.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.887
Yo, we're cool,
but we don't talk about this. Never.

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.247
What?

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.568
Hello? Yeah, Mom, what?

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:51.044
Looks like Emilio's compadres
came out early to set an ambush.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.287
This guy.

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.689
My compadres are coming from Mexico,
which is in that direction.

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:58.008
And they ain't planning
on jacking no one.

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.328
Only one way to find out.

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.371
Draco! Get them!

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.687
Whoa, whoa, man, what's that?

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.490
You gotta be kidding me.
Come on, let's finish this. On me.

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:25.648
I ain't leaving this guy
to watch the merch.

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:28.167
Fine, you stay here. I'll go.

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:31.682
Come on, Stack, it's just a kid
and his dog out there. Let's go.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.605
Justin. Justin!

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.566
Ready for Round 2?

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:58.927
Fight smart, Max!

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.010
He's got something. Come on.

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:03.881
Hey, did you hear that? That's Max.

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.050
Come on, hurry up.

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.881
The dogs, through the trees, look.
There they are. Come on, come on, come on.

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:35.650
Yo.

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.848
I'm gonna go get a clear shot.

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:16.487
Tyler!

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.442
Emilio! He's coming your way!

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.207
Chuy!

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:39.123
What are you doing here?

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:42.531
Who are you here with, huh?
Who are you here with?

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:45.007
No one, primo.
Got lost here by myself, B.

01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.130
Don't lie to me.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.607
- Who are you here with?
- Whoa.

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.249
Ugh! Aah!

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.530
Aah!

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:17.526
Justin! Justin!

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:23.681
- Emilio!
- Get down.

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:29.361
- Emilio!
- I broke my leg!

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:46.485
Max.

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.805
Max.

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.641
Max!

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.970
Aah!

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:11.367
Max.

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:21.881
Justin.

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.650
- Oh, son.
- You okay?

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:25.881
Thank God.

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.164
Oh.

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.562
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.650
- Did you bring anybody with you?
- Besides Max, Carmen and Chuy.

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.283
- Are they okay?
- Yeah, yeah, they're fine.

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:40.205
Tyler's right behind me.
He's coming up fast. We need to go.

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.807
- We gotta get to the highway.
- Let's take this truck.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.528
No, Tyler took the keys.
But we can slow him down.

01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.606
Let's go.

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.405
- Where's Ray?
- Get in the truck.

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.127
What happened?

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:12.163
Give me the keys and get in the truck!

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.561
Justin. Wait.

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:30.888
Justin, I'm just slowing
you and Max down.

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.524
So much for taking that truck out.

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.802
You and Max just go on to the highway...

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.486
and I'll keep these guys
off you as long as I can.

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.043
Every time I've been in trouble...

01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:45.447
Max has taken the fight away
to keep me safe.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.166
Wouldn't be right if I didn't
do the same for my dad.

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.443
Justin! Justin!

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:59.690
Come on, come on, come on. There he is!

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:23.882
Stop the truck. Stop the truck!

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.161
You go after Ray.

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:03.211
Come on, Max!

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.210
Hey.

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.364
Max!

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:43.320
Whoa!

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.490
Aah!

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.405
Whoa.

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.650
Tyler!

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.767
Tyler!

01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:21.210
Don't you hurt my boy!

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.523
This never had to happen.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:26.686
None of it!

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.764
What am I supposed
to do with you now, huh?

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:32.769
What am I supposed to do with you now?!

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:16.601
- Justin.
- You can't go down there, I'm sorry.

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.643
That's my friend, though.

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:55.608
Hey, Kyle.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.961
I know that we didn't...

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:06.522
We didn't really get along too well.

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.203
We fought a lot.

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:14.320
But I guess a lot of brothers
do that at the start.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:21.208
I'm sorry that we won't...

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:25.409
Won't get a chance
to really grow old together...

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.082
become friends.

01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:34.885
Yep.

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:45.521
I just wanted to thank you for Max.

01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.404
And tell you...

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.803
I love you.

01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:01.409
As long as I live,
I'm never gonna forget you.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.047
Okay.

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.050
Come on.

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:40.610
Yeah, Max.

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:44.561
Looks like we got some carnitas
cooking in the house tonight.

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.530
Gonna do this every time I come in?

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:49.650
When you're an hour late,
you bet I will. Where have you been?

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:52.207
Out cleaning up Gotham,
taking out villains, yo.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:55.404
He's gotta be a superhero
if he's gonna be my boyfriend.

01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:59.167
Yeah. Gotta be a blind superhero
like Daredevil, right?

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:02.131
- Dude, shut up! And stay.
- Whoa.

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:07.403
Chuy, I'm glad you came.
I know your family must be upset about...

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.285
Emilio should be in jail, bro.
It's the right thing.

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.690
He was bad news for my family too.
That's between us.

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:17.690
Hey, Max. How you doing, buddy?
Good to see you.

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:19.605
Hey, Mr. Wincott.

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:21.325
I've got all my guys at home.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.284
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, sweetheart.

01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:25.961
Dad, where's Max's cage?

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:28.766
I hauled it off to the scrapyard.

01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:32.203
I thought it was time for Max
to be inside with us from now on.

01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:35.770
What do you say to your father?

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.445
It's about time.

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:43.521
Yo, that's cold, B. Man, that's nastier
than Carmen's cooking, man.

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:47.805
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, dog.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.924
She hit me, two times.
Why are you always taking her side?

01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:59.962
Take it easy on him, Max.
He's a friendly.

01:44:00.305 --> 01:44:06.816
