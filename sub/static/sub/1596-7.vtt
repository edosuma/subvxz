11:11.438 --> 11:13.440
AND KEEP IT THAT WAY.

11:17.544 --> 11:20.614

THE FATHER GETS THE BABY!

11:20.614 --> 11:22.282
IT'S THE LAW!

11:22.282 --> 11:24.718

14:22.696 --> 14:24.764
- FOUR EARRINGS.
- TWO PAIRS.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.132
EARRINGS COME IN PAIRS.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.734
GOD HELPS THOSE
WHO HELP THEMSELVES.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.427
THAT'S HOW I STARTED THE TALK
WITH MY MOM.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.162
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME
TO MOUNT YOUR MAN.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.531
- THOSE GERIATRICS
AT THE NURSING HOME

16:04.531 --> 16:06.166
DROP LIKE FLIES, RIGHT?

16:06.166 --> 16:08.501

16:15.809 --> 16:17.577
AT LEAST THIS WAY,
I'LL KNOW WHEN SHE'S FERTILE.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.713
I DON'T WANT KEVIN FUCKING
MY MOM ANY MORE THAN HE HAS TO.

16:19.713 --> 16:21.648
- SO, YOU MUST LOSE

16:21.648 --> 16:23.883
A COUPLE OF THOSE SENIORS
AT THE HOME A WEEK, RIGHT?

16:23.883 --> 16:25.685
- MORE WHEN BERNICE
IS WORKING.

16:25.685 --> 16:29.155
THAT NEGLIGENT BITCH IS LIKE
THE GRIM FUCKING REAPER. WHY?

16:29.155 --> 16:33.226
- I NEED A BODY.
TO GET THE KIDS BACK.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.363
- A REAL LIVE BODY?

16:36.363 --> 16:39.432
THANKS.
KNEW I COULD COUNT ON YOU.

16:41.835 --> 16:45.872

16:49.709 --> 16:52.545
YOU ALWAYS HAD A GREAT
SENSE OF HUMOR, PADRE.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.548
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LAUGHS
IN RELIGION THESE DAYS.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.983
TOO MUCH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE.

16:56.983 --> 16:59.152
IT TURNS THE KIDS OFF.
- GOT A SERMON TO WRITE.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.821
- WHILE YOU'RE
PUTTING PEN TO PAPER,

17:01.821 --> 17:03.857
HOW ABOUT DASHING OFF
A LETTER FOR YOURS TRULY?

17:03.857 --> 17:05.325
- KIDS GOT TAKEN AWAY
AGAIN?

17:05.325 --> 17:07.994
- SUPERLATIVES APPRECIATED.

17:07.994 --> 17:10.764

REFERENCES THE LAST TWO TIMES,

17:10.764 --> 17:12.065
AND YOU'RE STILL
A DEADBEAT.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.100
- I'VE TURNED OVER
A NEW LEAF.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.636
- YOU'RE THE REASON WE HAD TO
INSTALL SECURITY CAMERAS.

17:16.636 --> 17:21.608
CLOSE THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY OUT.
- SO THAT'S IT?

17:21.608 --> 17:26.579
YOU'RE TURNING AWAY SINNERS
WHO ARE LOOKING FOR FORGIVENESS?

17:26.579 --> 17:30.750
THIS--THIS IS WHY WHITE KIDS
ARE FLOCKING TO ALLAH.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.952
WE ARE IN A WAR
FOR HEARTS AND MINDS,

17:32.952 --> 17:34.821
AND YOU ARE SHIPPING
AMERICAN YOUTH

17:34.821 --> 17:37.257
TO TERROR CAMPS
IN PAKISTAN.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.992
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

17:38.992 --> 17:41.494
WHEN YOU PUT A GERMAN
IN CHARGE OF THE CHURCH.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.829
- YOU'RE NOT LEAVING,
ARE YOU?

17:42.829 --> 17:43.830
- YOU COULD JUST REPRINT

17:43.830 --> 17:45.165
THE ONE YOU DID LAST TIME.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.767
- THEN YOU'LL GET
THE HELL OUT?

17:47.767 --> 17:50.103
- USE PARISH LETTERHEAD.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.177

TRY THE DESITIN.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.113

18:04.984 --> 18:08.321
AND TICKLE HIM.
DON'T FORGET TO TICKLE HIM.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.291
HE LOVES THAT,
ESPECIALLY UNDER THE ARMPIT.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.926
HE LAUGHS SO HARD.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.295
- ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT?

18:15.295 --> 18:19.799
- HE SHOULD KNOW HIS DAD.
YEAH.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.335
THIS WAY, HE'LL GET TO BE
WITH EVERYONE,

18:22.335 --> 18:24.537
JUST LIKE A TIMESHARE.

18:24.537 --> 18:29.476

18:54.868 --> 18:58.037
[sniffles]

18:58.037 --> 19:00.940
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

19:00.940 --> 19:04.143
- CAN'T SEE HOW.
I MISS HIM ALREADY.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.718
YOU WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS?

19:12.785 --> 19:14.787
BABE?

19:16.990 --> 19:19.893
- I SHOULD GET BACK

19:19.893 --> 19:20.994
- IMMIGRATION IS GETTING
SUSPICIOUS.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.662
- NOT MY FAULT.

19:22.662 --> 19:26.165
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE
IN THIS ACCOUNT, EXACTLY?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.001

YOU KNOW, DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME.
JUST ASSUMED I'D BE ON BOARD.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.186
- AND WHY WOULD SHE ASK YOU?

19:47.186 --> 19:51.424
- IT'S NOT ONLY HER DECISION.
IT AFFECTS ME TOO.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.393
- YOU ALWAYS TAKE CARE
OF YOUR FAMILY.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.930
- YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T EXACTLY
SIGN UP FOR THAT.

19:56.930 --> 19:59.699
- SHE IS TOO GOOD FOR YOU.
CABLE.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.701
- YOU MIND IF I MAKE
ONE OF THESE OUT TO CASH?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.336
NOTHING BIG. JUST SOME
"WALKING AROUND" MONEY.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.804
JUST A COUPLE GRAND.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.106

I'M TAPPED.

20:09.475 --> 20:12.178
MY PARENTS' MONEY IS

AND I'M GONNA NEED SOME CASH

20:13.646 --> 20:15.415
IF I'M SUPPORTING
A WHOLE FAMILY NOW.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.850
YOU ALWAYS TAKE CARE
OF YOUR FAMILY.

20:17.850 --> 20:22.755
- YOU TAKE CARE OF THEM,
NOT NANDO.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.527

SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.298
- WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

20:32.298 --> 20:33.833
SHE'S BEEN DOING THE JOB

20:33.833 --> 20:36.035
- YOU COOL WITH IT?
- WHATEVER IT TAKES. YOU?

20:36.035 --> 20:38.871

20:49.515 --> 20:52.418
- MY DAD PISTOL-WHIPPED HIM.
- WHY?

20:52.418 --> 20:55.321
- SINCE WHEN DOES ANYONE NEED
A REASON TO PISTOL-WHIP MICKEY?

20:55.321 --> 20:58.057
HAVE YOU SIGNED UP YET?
- FOR WHAT?

20:58.057 --> 21:01.060
- S.A.T. THE DEADLINE'S

I'M NOT
THE PERFECT PARENT.

44:31.102 --> 44:35.473
I LIKE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME,
TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST.

44:35.473 --> 44:40.245
SOMETIMES I GO TOO FAR.

44:40.245 --> 44:43.248
BUT I LOVE MY KIDS.

44:43.248 --> 44:46.251
THEY MEAN THE WORLD TO ME.

44:48.186 --> 44:51.489
I DON'T KNOW--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D BE

44:51.489 --> 44:53.124
IF I WASN'T A DAD.

44:53.124 --> 44:55.760
I'D BE NOTHING.

44:55.760 --> 44:58.596
PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY KIDS
AWAY FROM ME.

44:59.831 --> 45:02.734
- MS. GALLAGHER,
YOU WANT TO TELL ME

45:02.734 --> 45:05.770
WHY YOUR FATHER SHOULD BE
DECLARED UNFIT?

45:10.375 --> 45:13.411
- WE WERE LIVING
OUT OF A CAR ONCE.

45:13.411 --> 45:16.648
UNCLE NICK
HAD KICKED US OUT.

45:16.648 --> 45:20.385
WE COULDN'T FIND ANYONE ELSE
WHO'D TAKE US IN.

45:20.385 --> 45:23.755
LIP AND IAN AND ME
WERE SLEEPING IN THE BACKSEAT

45:23.755 --> 45:25.990
WHEN FRANK PULLED OVER.

45:25.990 --> 45:30.295
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
THINK IT WAS HALSTEAD.

45:30.295 --> 45:32.797
TOLD ME TO TAKE THE BOYS
AND SIT ON A CURB,

45:32.797 --> 45:35.467
AND HE'D BE RIGHT BACK.

45:35.467 --> 45:39.471
I WAS SIX.

45:39.471 --> 45:42.707
FEW HOURS LATER, WE'RE STILL
SITTING ON THE SIDEWALK,

45:42.707 --> 45:46.177
AND IAN'S HEAD
IS BURNING UP.

45:46.177 --> 45:49.848
HE'S HYSTERICAL.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

45:49.848 --> 45:54.052
SO I RAN DOWN THE STREET,
LIP UNDER ONE ARM,

45:54.052 --> 45:58.056
IAN UNDER THE OTHER,
TRYING TO FLAG DOWN HELP.

45:58.056 --> 46:00.859
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER
SCORING CRACK

46:00.859 --> 46:02.660
THAN A RIDE TO THE CLINIC.

46:02.660 --> 46:06.564
I FINALLY MADE IT ON FOOT.

46:06.564 --> 46:11.269

WHO KNOWS?

46:16.975 --> 46:21.813
I DIDN'T FIND FRANK
TILL A COUPLE DAYS LATER.

46:22.981 --> 46:26.117
FIRST THING HE ASKED ME

46:26.117 --> 46:28.286
WAS HOW MUCH MONEY
I HAD ON ME.

46:33.391 --> 46:36.361
I WISH I COULD SAY
THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME,

46:36.361 --> 46:39.731
BUT IT WAS JUST THE FIRST.

46:42.734 --> 46:47.505

AN ALCOHOLIC AND AN ADDICT.

HE TAKES WHAT HE PLEASES
AND HE OFFERS NOTHING.

46:50.441 --> 46:54.212
NO MONEY, NO SUPPORT.

46:57.282 --> 47:00.785
I'VE DONE WHAT I COULD
TO HELP RAISE MY SIBLINGS.

47:00.785 --> 47:03.454
I WISH
I COULD HAVE DONE MORE.

47:03.454 --> 47:05.657
I'M NOT ASKING
FOR YOUR PITY

47:05.657 --> 47:08.226

47:08.226 --> 47:09.861

TO GIVE THESE KIDS

47:09.861 --> 47:11.529
EVERYTHING
THAT THEY DESERVE,

47:11.529 --> 47:16.568

47:30.281 --> 47:31.683

FROM ALL APPEARANCES,

47:31.683 --> 47:33.718
YOUR FATHER'S
A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR,

47:33.718 --> 47:36.421

BEFORE HE SCREWS UP AGAIN.

WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST

47:45.863 --> 47:48.366
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO PROVE ABUSE.

- SO YOU'RE GONNA LET HIM KEEP
HIS RIGHTS TO THE KIDS?

47:50.635 --> 47:55.506
- I'M CONSIDERING
APPOINTING YOU THE GUARDIAN,

47:55.506 --> 47:57.408
WHICH WOULD GIVE YOU
LEGAL RIGHTS

47:57.408 --> 47:59.177
TO MAKE DECISIONS
ABOUT THESE KIDS.

47:59.177 --> 48:01.446
