WEBVTT

01:10.571 --> 01:14.371
Admiral Collingwoodl

01:16.994 --> 01:18.587
Well, Admiral?

01:18.662 --> 01:19.914
Great news, Your Majesty!

01:21.164 --> 01:23.087
The French are defeated at last.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.794
Also the Russians, the Portuguese,

01:25.877 --> 01:26.924
the Chinese

01:27.004 --> 01:28.506
and the Welsh.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.310
Then our navy rules the ocean.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.430
Almost entirely, Your Majesty.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.857
"Almost"?

01:39.391 --> 01:42.235
Unfortunately, just here,

01:42.311 --> 01:44.860
we're still having a little trouble with...

01:47.065 --> 01:48.738
...pirates.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.116
What does it say on my royal crest, Admiral?

01:53.322 --> 01:55.416
"I hate pirates,"

01:55.866 --> 01:57.118
ma'am.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.873
Exactly.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.124
Hate them.

02:00.203 --> 02:04.253
With their idiotic shanties!

02:04.333 --> 02:06.802
And their ridiculous hats!

02:06.877 --> 02:11.428
And their endless, blasted roaring!

02:11.506 --> 02:15.181
I want them sunk, Admiral!

02:15.260 --> 02:18.935
Scuppered, smashed, fed to the sharks.
Do you hear me?

02:19.014 --> 02:21.733
I hate pirates!

02:23.518 --> 02:25.145
Ifstheloofing.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.821
It's the cutlasses.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.365
Ifstheloofing!

02:28.440 --> 02:30.067
<i>It's the cutlasses!</i>

02:30.400 --> 02:31.492
Loofing!

02:31.568 --> 02:32.785
<i>Cutlasses!</i>

02:33.904 --> 02:35.076
Loofing!

02:53.924 --> 02:55.176
Sorry, Captain.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.762
We were just discussing
what's the best bit about being a pirate.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.978
You were, were you?

03:02.057 --> 03:04.936
I suggested it might be the looting.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.771
Whereas I contend it's the shiny cutlasses.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.983
And I thought
it was the chance to catch exotic diseases.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.404
Well, you're, all of you, wrong.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.699
The best bit about being a pirate

03:18.949 --> 03:21.828
isn't the looting or the cutlasses.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.379
It's not the grog or the scurvy.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.545
Or the scantily clad mermaids.

03:27.624 --> 03:32.175
The best bit about being a pirate

03:32.254 --> 03:34.803
is Ham Night!

03:36.466 --> 03:37.638
Ham Night!

03:40.470 --> 03:42.017
Ham Night!

03:47.102 --> 03:48.274
Ham!

03:59.322 --> 04:01.074
On your nose.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.003
Go, Captain. Go, Captain.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.964
Hey! Hey!

04:13.962 --> 04:15.805
It's like a meat ballet.

04:15.881 --> 04:17.257
- To Ham Night!
- Ham!

04:17.339 --> 04:19.216
- And to the Pirate Captain!
- Pirate Captain!

04:19.634 --> 04:20.635
Pirate Captain!

04:23.889 --> 04:25.061
How was that, Number Two?

04:25.140 --> 04:27.563
You've still got it, Captain.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.858
I'd take a jellyfish in the face for that man.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.981
Okay, now, shush, shush, shush.
Settle down, lads. Shush.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.532
- Lads, lads.
- Pirates!

04:34.608 --> 04:35.905
- It's not all about me.
- Don't be modest.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.073
No,no,no.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.154
Behind every captain with glittering eyes

04:39.237 --> 04:41.035
-and a luxuriant beard...
- Luxuriant!

04:41.364 --> 04:42.536
That's what it is.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.085
...There's a crew of briny rogues.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.457
Briny rogues!

04:46.536 --> 04:49.085
Sure, some of you
are as ugly as a sea cucumber.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.458
Will you get away with ya?

04:50.540 --> 04:53.214
Some of you are closer
to being a chair or coat rack than a pirate.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.888
And some of you
are just fish I've dressed up in a hat.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.184
But you're still the best crew
a captain could wish for.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.722
Don't forget Polly.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.103
And not forgetting, never forgetting...

05:08.350 --> 05:11.900
...Polly. The finest parrot
to sail the seven seas.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.150
Come on, girl.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.698
I love her beady eyes.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.076
Who's the feathery
heart and soul of our boat?

05:18.276 --> 05:19.994
Is it you? Is it you?

05:20.070 --> 05:22.164
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.866
It's definitely you, isn't it?

05:23.949 --> 05:26.748
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.590
Right. Where was I?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.043
Ah, yes! Ah, yes.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.422
Important announcement.

05:36.545 --> 05:39.219
By order of the Pirate King himself...

05:46.346 --> 05:48.440
The Pirate of the Year Awards?

05:48.723 --> 05:49.940
Are you going to...

05:50.267 --> 05:51.610
Are you going to enter again?

05:51.935 --> 05:54.779
That I am, Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.695
I know it hasn't
worked out perfectly for the last...

05:57.774 --> 05:59.321
-20 year.
-20 years, yeah.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.620
Exactly, Pirate with Gout. 20 years.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.698
It might be a bit more. 21, 22...

06:04.781 --> 06:06.033
Yes, yes. Thank you, thank you.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.618
- You were very good, though.
- Shush!

06:07.701 --> 06:10.750
The point is,
every time I've entered, I've failed to win.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.082
So by the sheer law of maths...

06:14.207 --> 06:15.208
Maths.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.966
...I must have a really good chance this time.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.633
Are you with me, lads?

06:19.921 --> 06:22.470
Yes! This can only end brilliantly.

06:22.591 --> 06:25.094
Then let's go plundering!

07:35.330 --> 07:36.752
Land ho!

07:38.208 --> 07:40.051
Blood Island.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.631
So-called because
it's the exact shape of some blood.

08:15.537 --> 08:16.789
Yeah!

08:35.515 --> 08:36.687
Excuse me. Mind out.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.188
Captain coming through.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.394
Thank you very much.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.568
Thank you.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.239
One Pirate of the Year
entry form, if you please.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.158
Thank you.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.819
Now, let's see.

08:47.902 --> 08:48.903
II

08:48.987 --> 08:50.204
Oh, yes.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.203
"Roaring." Check.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.408
"Shanties."

08:53.491 --> 08:55.084
I shall put "rousing."

08:55.326 --> 08:56.373
"Beard"?

08:56.494 --> 08:57.620
Luxuï¬‚ant

08:57.704 --> 08:59.047
Obviously.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.295
Do you think I should sign it in blood?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.717
Make it more dramatic?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.090
Might be a bit on the showy side.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.093
Bit too much. You might be right.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.392
Pirate Captain.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.347
You can't lose, Captain.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.471
I'd bet my face.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.931
Well, thank you, Albino Pirate.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.231
You're a shoo-in, sir.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.856
Sure, there's not a pirate
on the seven seas can match you.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.117
Lock up your daughters!

09:30.153 --> 09:33.248
It's me, Peg-Leg Hastings!

09:33.323 --> 09:35.746
Back from plunderin' the Spanish Main.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.077
Good grief.

09:37.160 --> 09:42.041
And I reckon this will make me
Pirate of the Year.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.968
Don't worry, sir. He's all flash and no bang.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.273
Cutlass Liz.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.571
The Butcher of Barbados.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.614
Hello, boys.

10:08.483 --> 10:13.284
You're probably all wondering
if I'm still as deadly as I am beautiful.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.371
Well, lam.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.963
Hello, Cutlass, you trollop.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.757
Peg-Leg, you pile of squid bait.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.710
Check it out, lubbers.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.546
The world's biggest diamond.

10:30.213 --> 10:33.092
That baby's got my name on it.

10:35.718 --> 10:39.063
She doesn't even have a beard.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.768
Sweet Neptune's briny pants.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.608
Black Bellamy.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.318
Roar!

11:30.440 --> 11:33.944
Read it and weep, ya coves!

11:34.110 --> 11:38.581
That's right,
Black Bellamy is gonna be Pirate of the Year.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.078
Again.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.535
How are you? Good to see you.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.086
Grog for everybody!

11:43.328 --> 11:45.126
Grog for everybody!

11:47.290 --> 11:50.794
Wow, we are rubbish
compared to them, aren't we?

12:11.814 --> 12:14.067
Perhaps we should be off, sir.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.151
Yes.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.492
Yes, yes, good point.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.575
I just remembered, actually,
I have some very important

12:21.658 --> 12:24.832
bits of rope I need to untangle.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.750
Thank you.

12:35.421 --> 12:39.517
Well, if it isn't the Pirate Captain.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.518
Hello, Bellamy. Cutlass. Peg-Leg.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.814
Didn't notice you come in.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.311
The beard's looking great, my man.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.489
And I see that you're more wanted than ever.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.035
Come on, everybody, be nice.
Give him a break.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.404
Bring it down a little bit. All right.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.488
Seriously, Captain,

13:00.780 --> 13:02.578
how's the pirating business treating you?

13:02.657 --> 13:05.376
Yeah, yeah, brilliantly, brilliantly.
Thanks for asking.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.249
Treasure coming out of my eyeballs.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.623
Taken to washing my hair in 50-pound notes.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.090
Really?

13:11.165 --> 13:13.293
If you've got so much booty,

13:13.376 --> 13:16.505
then how come
you're still sailing that old wreck?

13:19.257 --> 13:22.010
Anyway, look,
I'd love to stay and chat, but, you know,

13:22.677 --> 13:26.898
places to pillage, people to...
People to skewer.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.904
Come on!

13:32.979 --> 13:35.402
That is disgusting.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.193
Wait a minute.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.703
Captain, what is this?

13:41.237 --> 13:42.784
- What?
- Captain?

13:42.864 --> 13:44.866
That's nothing.
Could I possibly have that back?

13:44.949 --> 13:46.326
- Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.
- Thank you.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.456
"Pirate of the Year"?

13:48.202 --> 13:50.955
You're entering Pirate of the Year?

13:51.039 --> 13:53.167
No,no,no,no,no.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.757
- Yes.
- Again?

13:57.503 --> 13:58.550
Yes!

14:00.340 --> 14:02.843
Come on. Listen, did they change the rules?

14:02.925 --> 14:06.725
I mean, I always thought they gave it
to the pirate with the most booty.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.523
Do they nowjust give it to the guy
with the fattest parrot?

14:09.599 --> 14:12.102
She is not fat. She's just big-boned.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.361
She's fat, dude.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.859
Yeah, go on. Go on, then, laugh.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.315
Everyone laugh.

14:24.155 --> 14:27.125
Ignore them, Captain. It's not worth it.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.794
The trophy would just clash
with your wallpaper, anyway.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.046
You'll see, you'll see.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.723
I will be Pirate of the Year.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.221
Yes.

14:45.927 --> 14:49.272
And then you'll be laughing on
the other side of your faces.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.733
Yes.

14:52.809 --> 14:56.609
And believe me, that is
a very painful thing to do.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.984
Come on, lads.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.743
Well...

15:11.828 --> 15:13.671
All right, now listen up, you coves.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.545
We'll show those swabs
a thing or two about pirating.

15:17.250 --> 15:22.006
There's still time
to fill these chests with sparkling booty.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.012
I can practically taste that trophy!

15:25.174 --> 15:27.768
Trophy! Trophy! Trophy!

15:33.015 --> 15:34.938
Captain! Sail off the port bow!

15:36.102 --> 15:37.319
Let's get after her, Number Two.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.863
Aye, aye, sir.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.277
Clap on all sail!

15:40.356 --> 15:42.654
Royals and topgallants!

15:42.733 --> 15:43.734
Release those gallants!

16:06.215 --> 16:08.843
Fire those long things that go bang.

16:08.926 --> 16:12.055
Fire cannons four and six!

16:19.145 --> 16:20.863
Eat cannonball, lubbers.

16:25.401 --> 16:28.200
Here we go, lads! Look and learn.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.959
Go get 'em, Pirate Captain!

16:33.659 --> 16:36.629
Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.256
And I'm here for your gold.

16:39.373 --> 16:44.004
Gold? This is a plague boat, old man.
I'd give my right arm for some gold.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.631
Or my left.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.182
Right, lads.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.884
Minor hiccup, that last one.

16:49.967 --> 16:50.968
This time,

16:51.135 --> 16:52.512
it's payday!

16:55.264 --> 16:58.859
I'm the Pirate Captain,
and I'm here for your gold.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.779
Geography field trip.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.483
I'm the Pirate Captain, and...

17:06.776 --> 17:08.118
Naturists.

17:09.237 --> 17:12.707
Pirate Captain. Blah, blah, blah, blah, gold.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.159
Ghost ship.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.045
Sorry.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.840
Captain, we've sighted another ship, sir.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.506
That's nice.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.096
Do you want to give the order to attack?

18:17.179 --> 18:20.058
No, not really, Number Two. No, I think I've...

18:20.141 --> 18:22.735
Think I had enough of piracy.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.153
I'm hanging up my cutlass.

18:24.687 --> 18:26.439
Captain, no!

18:26.522 --> 18:29.196
Yeah, I was thinking
I might go into baby clothes, actually.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.450
What?

18:30.526 --> 18:33.530
I hear there's a fortune to be made
in baby clothes because

18:33.613 --> 18:35.206
babies grow so fast.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.830
No, but you can't. I mean, the crew...

18:37.908 --> 18:39.626
They'd... They'd be lost without you.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.670
What was I thinking, Number Two?

18:41.746 --> 18:43.419
Pirate of the Year?

18:43.497 --> 18:44.623
Me?

18:44.707 --> 18:46.084
Look at the trophy cabinet.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.676
Best Anecdote About a Squid.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.973
I mean, that is all I've got to show
for my entire career.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.804
Pirate of the Year?

18:57.887 --> 19:00.390
It's just commercialized nonsense.

19:00.598 --> 19:03.067
Real piracy isn't about trophies.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.895
It's about fighting up staircases backwards.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.150
It's about sliding down sails
with a knife in your teeth.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.449
Beard <i>glossiness!</i>

19:12.318 --> 19:14.992
And think about
all the adventures we've had.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.369
Our adventure with Aztecs.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.492
Our adventure with that pig.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.576
Our adventure with...

19:25.790 --> 19:29.294
Okay, maybe not the librarians.
But the fun we've had.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.175
And what about the shanties?

19:31.754 --> 19:34.348
Well, I mean...
People would miss my shanties.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.096
And the running people through.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.516
Well, I... I do enjoy running people through.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.222
Enjoy it? You're brilliant at it!

19:41.305 --> 19:44.605
You're a brine-soaked terror of the high seas!

19:45.768 --> 19:46.940
Do you think so, Number Two?

19:47.019 --> 19:48.817
Everyone does!

19:48.896 --> 19:52.150
You're more of a pirate
than Black Bellamy or any of them.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.031
You're a real pirate.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.703
That's why the crew,

19:55.778 --> 19:59.203
they think you're the best thing
since boil-in-the-bag ham.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.204
Why do you think they all

20:01.450 --> 20:03.873
<i>got that tattoo? Come on.</i>

20:04.286 --> 20:05.378
What do you say?

20:06.122 --> 20:07.920
Arrr!

20:07.998 --> 20:10.501
By Neptune, where's that ship?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.713
This is the one, lads!

20:14.422 --> 20:17.175
Ninth time lucky! I can feel it in my beard!

20:17.633 --> 20:19.431
Well, don't just sit there like lemons!

20:19.969 --> 20:21.266
Hoist the flag!

20:21.345 --> 20:22.642
Standard, sir?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.895
Or extra gruesome?

20:24.974 --> 20:26.317
Extra gruesome!

20:26.517 --> 20:28.645
Let's make their gizzards shake.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.583
<i>Journal of Charles Dan/vin.</i>

20:42.658 --> 20:46.959
<i>Day 93 aboard the</i> Beagle.

20:47.037 --> 20:51.793
<i>I have, today,
discovered a new kind of barnacle,</i>

20:51.876 --> 20:57.758
<i>which I have categorised
in the order of Pygophora.</i>

21:01.469 --> 21:04.973
<i>I'll never get a girlfriend. I am so unhappy.</i>

21:19.195 --> 21:23.371
<i>And now I'm being attacked by pirates.</i>

21:37.379 --> 21:41.134
Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain,
and I'm here for your gold.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.057
I haven't got any gold.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.014
No gold, eh?

21:46.096 --> 21:48.565
Then what, might I ask, is this?

21:49.058 --> 21:50.605
It's a baboon's kidney.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.357
Is it?

21:53.187 --> 21:55.485
And what about this?

21:55.564 --> 21:57.658
It's another baboon's kidney.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.528
We searched the hold, Captain.

22:01.695 --> 22:02.912
And?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.790
Just creatures.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.789
Bits of creatures in jars.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.417
And an unhappy-looking baboon.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.084
What kind of ship is this?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.712
We're a...

22:17.795 --> 22:21.550
Well, we were a scientific expedition.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.760
Charles Darwin, at your service, sir.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.888
For pity's sake!

22:26.971 --> 22:29.724
Is it so much to ask? Is it?

22:30.724 --> 22:33.352
I just want one tiny bit of success!

22:33.435 --> 22:37.156
One teensy weensy bit
of respect from my peers

22:37.231 --> 22:38.778
just once in my life!

22:39.942 --> 22:41.364
Is that such a crime?

22:41.443 --> 22:42.865
Is it?

22:45.281 --> 22:47.033
- No?
- No!

22:47.616 --> 22:48.617
No.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.703
But you try telling that to the universe.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.790
Just once, just once for things to go right.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.125
Just... Just once.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.264
So, are we done here?

23:06.844 --> 23:08.721
<i>Dear Diary,</i>

23:08.804 --> 23:10.932
<i>about to meet a watery grave.</i>

23:11.015 --> 23:12.733
It's nothing personal, you understand.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.228
It's just... It's been a tough week,

23:15.311 --> 23:18.110
and a good plank walk
usually cheers him up.

23:18.480 --> 23:22.201
<i>Will die without reaching second base

23:22.401 --> 23:24.779

23:27.114 --> 23:28.206
<i>Today's weather:</i>

23:28.908 --> 23:30.000
<i>inclement.</i>

23:37.291 --> 23:39.089
- Stop!
- Now what?

23:39.168 --> 23:41.512
Last request, is it?
Do we have to grant those?

23:41.587 --> 23:44.511
Is there some sort of
human rights convention we're signed up to?

23:44.673 --> 23:46.471
- But that bird!
- My parrot?

23:46.634 --> 23:47.977
She's just big-boned!

23:48.052 --> 23:50.976
No, she's not.
I mean... I mean, she's not a parrot.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.432
Not a parrot?

23:52.514 --> 23:53.891
What's he on about, old girl?

23:53.974 --> 23:55.100
She's... She's...

23:55.184 --> 23:57.983
She's the scientific discovery of our age!

23:58.103 --> 24:00.026
She's a...

24:02.024 --> 24:04.652
Sorry. It's just,

24:04.735 --> 24:06.783
that's my favourite bit.

24:12.326 --> 24:13.953
A dodo, you say?

24:14.036 --> 24:16.789
They've been extinct for 150 years.

24:16.872 --> 24:20.092
To find one alive today, it's quite incredible.

24:20.209 --> 24:23.213
Well, clever old girl. Not going extinct.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.889
If I might be so bold, I would be prepared

24:26.882 --> 24:29.726
to pay you 10 pounds for your Polly.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.104
Polly's not for sale.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.647
Ten pound.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.894
She's one of the family.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.647
She's like an auntie.

24:36.725 --> 24:37.942
With a beak.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.235
Yeah, I'm afraid they're right, Charles.

24:39.311 --> 24:42.155
Polly here is the feathery
heart and soul of the boat.

24:42.231 --> 24:43.448
Come on, little dodo.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.493
It's such a missed opportunity.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.331
If I could've presented her

24:51.407 --> 24:55.002
in London to the Royal Society
at their annual science show...

24:55.077 --> 24:56.954
No question of that, I'm afraid.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.460
- She'd have been an absolute sensation.
- Yeah, well, can't be helped.

24:59.581 --> 25:02.084
And of course a shoo-in for the top prize.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.596
Prize?

25:05.671 --> 25:08.675
For best scientific discovery. Yes.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.679
This prize,

25:12.761 --> 25:14.604
-valuable, is it?
- Valuable?

25:16.682 --> 25:18.605
It's priceless.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.903
Untold riches.

25:24.690 --> 25:25.987
- Captain...
- No, no, no, no.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.785
I was thinking, perhaps,
perhaps I was being a touch hasty.

25:28.861 --> 25:29.953
But, Captain, London?

25:30.029 --> 25:31.497
The home of Queen Victoria,

25:31.739 --> 25:33.662
mortal enemy of pirates everywhere?

25:33.782 --> 25:36.001
We'll end up hanged at Execution Dock.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.872
We laugh in the face of danger, remember?

25:40.998 --> 25:43.547
- I don't.
- I don't really like danger at all.

25:45.085 --> 25:48.339
Captain, do you remember
the little talk we had?

25:48.672 --> 25:51.596
The one about whether pigs
are actually a type of fruit?

25:52.968 --> 25:53.969
No.

25:57.973 --> 25:58.974
No.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.436
The one about us trying
to avoid harebrained schemes

26:01.518 --> 26:03.065
that end in us facing certain death.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.988
You heard the man, Number Two.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.907
"Untold riches."

26:06.982 --> 26:07.983
Here's the plan.

26:08.192 --> 26:11.696
We go to London,
Polly wins this science show thingy,

26:11.779 --> 26:15.750
we take the prize money,
I enter Pirate of the Year, I win!

26:15.824 --> 26:17.246
Binggl

26:17.326 --> 26:19.294
- But, Captain, I'm not sure...
- It can't fail.

26:19.369 --> 26:22.919
And besides, look at her little face.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.877
I sure want to win that science prize.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.085
Squawk!

26:27.169 --> 26:28.796
Bravo, Captain!

26:28.879 --> 26:32.349
I see you're a man of vision!

26:34.093 --> 26:36.687
Right, then, Charles.
When is this science show of yours?

26:36.762 --> 26:38.435
A week tomorrow.

26:38.514 --> 26:39.982
Confound it!

26:40.057 --> 26:41.934
You see, we could've
made that with a good wind behind us,

26:42.017 --> 26:44.770
but unfortunately there's this dirty
great sea monster in the way.

26:47.189 --> 26:51.569
I think they just add those onto maps
for decoration, Captain.

26:54.488 --> 26:56.206
Is that a fact?

26:56.281 --> 26:58.124
Well, blow me down.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.332
I dare, you could learn something
from this fine fellow, Number Two.

27:46.582 --> 27:47.754
London Town.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.677
The most romantic city in the world.

28:06.894 --> 28:09.067
"Queen Victoria

28:09.271 --> 28:12.445
"welcomes you to London."

28:12.524 --> 28:13.901
That's nice.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.827
Perhaps she's not so bad after all.

28:21.575 --> 28:24.044
Well, don't look so worried, Number Two.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.917
Pirates are always visiting London.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.967
Turn back!

28:30.542 --> 28:33.011
This is the fate of pirates here!

28:33.795 --> 28:35.547
Is that Scarlett Morgan?

28:36.506 --> 28:38.224
Pirate Captain.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.643
Goodness me!

28:39.760 --> 28:42.263
I haven't seen you
since that business in Madagascar.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.522
Yes. I could've sworn they were girls.

28:47.601 --> 28:48.818
You're looking well, Morgan.

28:49.186 --> 28:50.563
Yeah, lost a bit of weight.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.193
What are you up to these days?

28:52.272 --> 28:53.319
You know, this and that.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.901
Yeah, just gonna enter
a science competition, actually.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.237
- Good luck with that.
- Yeah, thanks, thanks.

29:01.657 --> 29:02.909
No, no, wait, wait!

29:02.991 --> 29:04.208
Turn back!

29:04.284 --> 29:06.878
Turn back.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.167
- Sorry_
- No!

29:12.251 --> 29:14.379
Look what you've done to me boat.
Look at the state of it.

29:14.503 --> 29:15.846
I hope you've got some insurance, 'cause I...

29:17.547 --> 29:18.969
Right, then. We'll be off.

29:19.049 --> 29:20.767
I'll bring her back tomorrow
straight after the show.

29:20.842 --> 29:23.220
Well, don't be daft, Charles.
I'll be presenting Polly.

29:23.512 --> 29:24.764
- You?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.974
I always fancied
trying my hand at a spot of science.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.851
But you can't. I mean,

29:28.934 --> 29:31.528
the streets of London
are no place for pirates.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.731
Pirates? What pirates?

29:34.523 --> 29:35.615
Nobody here but us Girl Guides.

29:35.691 --> 29:36.817
Yes!

29:38.193 --> 29:39.866
I've got a badge for looting.

29:39.945 --> 29:42.994
We're not really Girl Guides.
It's us, the pirates.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.791
We're masters of disguise.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.039
How ingenious.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.373
But all the same, Captain,
best we lie low for the night.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.832
Perhaps at my house.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.009
- Captain, I really think...
- Good plan, Chuck.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.963
Be fun to see how you boffin types live.

29:59.423 --> 30:01.642
Well, come on. Taxi!

30:03.677 --> 30:05.270
Evening, Officer.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.393
Hidey-ho, ladies.

30:12.894 --> 30:16.068
London smells like Grandma.

30:21.945 --> 30:22.946
Whoa.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.158
Here we are.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.209
Home, sweet home.

30:32.539 --> 30:35.713
You don't get many women back here,
do you, Charles?

30:36.084 --> 30:39.509
People who live alone
are always serial killers.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.267
Sweet Neptune on a bike!

30:49.431 --> 30:50.808
Don't mind Mr Bobo.

30:51.058 --> 30:53.231
- Just an old project of mine.
- Project?

30:53.685 --> 30:55.028
Yeah, I had this theory.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.652
I thought that if you took a monkey,
gave him a monocle

30:57.731 --> 31:00.109
and covered up his gigantic, unsightly ass,

31:00.525 --> 31:02.527
then he would cease
to be a monkey and become more of a...

31:03.445 --> 31:05.698
A man-panzee, if you will.

31:05.781 --> 31:06.828
Bold theory.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.909
I don't like the monkey.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.753
But to be honest, monkeys are 10 a penny.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.956
He's not a patch on Polly here.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.004
Anyhow, big day tomorrow.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.251
We all need our rest.

31:18.335 --> 31:21.305
Let me show you to your room, Captain.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.633
Right behind you, Chuck.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.686
Now, here's the plan.

31:36.770 --> 31:40.491
You know what to do.
Wait until the bearded idiot is asleep,

31:40.565 --> 31:41.817
then sneak into his room and...

31:56.832 --> 31:57.833
Captain.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.920
It's... It's Mr Darwin, sir.
I'm sure he's up to no good.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.925
Honestly, Number Two, what's got into you?

32:03.004 --> 32:06.224
Thanks to Charles,
we're about to win lavish untold riches,

32:06.299 --> 32:08.597
and here you are
trying to find fault with the poor fellow.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.728
- Yes, but...
- No, no, no. Not another word.

32:10.804 --> 32:14.399
A future Pirate of the Year
needs his beauty sleep.

32:14.474 --> 32:17.273
Do you think you could
make nautical noises until we drop off?

32:24.734 --> 32:28.284
That's lovely. Now, that is lovely.
Can you do the shiver a timber?

32:34.035 --> 32:36.458
And just chuck in a few gulls, would you?

33:09.112 --> 33:11.410
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, our winner.</i>

33:11.781 --> 33:15.251
Give it up for the Pirate Captain!

33:31.676 --> 33:34.600
Congratulations, Pirate Captain.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.691
Nobody deserves this more than you.

33:39.059 --> 33:40.481
Thanks, Cutlass.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.439
And that beard of yours,

33:44.773 --> 33:46.275
it drives me

33:46.358 --> 33:48.326
crazy.

33:54.324 --> 33:55.325
Give it here.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.619
Give it back, Bellamy, it's mine!

33:57.911 --> 33:59.538
No, give it back.

34:03.667 --> 34:04.714
Neptune's navel!

34:05.126 --> 34:06.173
Come back here, you lubber.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.425
Stop, thief!

34:21.643 --> 34:23.110
I'll take that.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.156
Not so fast, my friend.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.571
Number Two!

34:29.985 --> 34:32.659
Number Two, are you all right?

34:33.989 --> 34:35.911
Unhand that dodo!

34:45.333 --> 34:46.630
Evening, Captain.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.484
Number Two!

35:19.200 --> 35:20.201
We're under attack!

35:20.368 --> 35:21.915
Abandon ship!

35:26.124 --> 35:28.047
Hello, Pirate Captain, Pirate with a Scarf!

35:41.222 --> 35:44.066
Come back here,
Mysterious Shadowy Figure!

35:47.937 --> 35:49.359
Faster! Faster!

36:17.258 --> 36:19.636
Got you! Are you all right, girl?

36:19.761 --> 36:22.514
Captain! I mean, what's going on?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.520
Don't play the innocent.

36:24.599 --> 36:28.103
You and your hench-monkey
tried to steal Polly.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.190
Steal Polly? Dear me, no, you're mistaken.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.946
Then how do you explain this?

36:41.282 --> 36:45.207
Well, I think it's obvious
what's happened, isn't it?

36:45.286 --> 36:46.378
Is it?

36:46.454 --> 36:48.627
Some jealous rival scientist

36:48.707 --> 36:51.551
must have tried to make off with the dodo.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.137
Well, that explains everything.

36:54.963 --> 36:57.057
Captain, please, let's go.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.509
Polly's not safe in London.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.764
I couldn't bear it
if something happened to Polly.

37:00.844 --> 37:03.313
Nothing is going to happen to Polly.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.392
She'll be perfectly safe.
Leave everything to me.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.476
Now, come on,
we can't keep that prize waiting.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.492
Anyone got a towel?

37:34.252 --> 37:36.755
Nice going, banana butt.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.599
Now this briny buffoon
is gonna grab all the glory.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.051
It's a disaster.

37:41.134 --> 37:42.556
It's...

37:44.012 --> 37:46.390
Bad news, I'm afraid, Captain.

37:46.473 --> 37:47.565
You can't go in.

37:48.892 --> 37:51.896
It's strictly scientists only, you see.

37:52.353 --> 37:55.232
I'll just have to present Polly

37:55.440 --> 37:56.487
myself.

37:56.566 --> 37:59.285
We're not really scientists.
It's us, the pirates.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.455
See? Masters of disguise.

38:02.572 --> 38:03.789
But where's Polly?

38:03.865 --> 38:06.368
That is on a need-to-know basis
from here on in, Charles.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.453
- Pardon?
- I am keeping her hidden.

38:08.536 --> 38:11.540
That shadowy figure could be anywhere.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.084
Luckily, I am not only a master of disguises,

38:14.167 --> 38:17.091
I am also a master of hiding things.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.298
Right, lads,
let's show these boffins what's what.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.973
But, Captain.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.143
- Really, I...
- Hello!

38:23.968 --> 38:25.891
We're here for the science show.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.688
We're scientists.

38:27.806 --> 38:30.184
That's a pipette, this is Charles Darwin,

38:30.266 --> 38:31.984
and I am the Scientist Captain.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.988
If you're a scientist, name three elements.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.231
Well, let's see now.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.034
There's... There's gold, ham...

38:42.028 --> 38:44.030
...and

38:44.113 --> 38:45.490
the tears of a mermaid.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.669
Yeah, two out of three. Close enough.
First on your left.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.543
The balloon of my airship contains

38:52.622 --> 38:54.670
-20,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas.
- Excuse me.

38:54.749 --> 38:55.966
Sorry.

38:56.209 --> 38:58.962
Just here, you will notice the open log fire

38:59.045 --> 39:02.345
to ensure a comfortable
temperature at higher altitudes.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.176
Captain?

39:04.759 --> 39:06.386
Captain, Captain, please.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.346
You can't possibly
appear on stage without Polly.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.477
Patience, Charles. All in good time.

39:11.474 --> 39:12.600
Excuse me. Sorry.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.275
- Sorry.
- Idiot!

39:18.356 --> 39:20.279
- Just a tick.
- But, Captain...

39:25.780 --> 39:27.123
How on earth did...

39:27.198 --> 39:33.547
My airship will revolutionise
the fields of meteorology and cartography.

39:33.621 --> 39:34.668
But mostly,

39:35.665 --> 39:38.168
it's for looking down ladies' tops.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.258
Ingenious.

39:45.341 --> 39:47.810
Captain, I really, really think

39:47.886 --> 39:50.105
it would be best if I take over from here.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.144
There's a certain manner
in which these things are conduc...

39:52.307 --> 39:53.274
Nonsense, Chuck.

39:53.349 --> 39:56.728
What this science stuff needs
is a bit of showmanship!

40:12.869 --> 40:14.246
Look, it's the captain.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.589
Captain! Captain!

40:18.082 --> 40:21.507
Fellow scientists, poindexters, geeks,

40:22.962 --> 40:24.964
prepare to be confounded.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.675
Prepare to be amazed.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.011
Prepare to...

40:29.844 --> 40:31.596
Wait a second. What's this?

40:36.184 --> 40:37.811
What's this?

40:41.689 --> 40:42.986
Stop!

40:44.233 --> 40:46.861
I am the world's leading doctor,

40:47.028 --> 40:51.499
and I declare the science you are doing
is too shocking by half.

40:51.574 --> 40:52.575
Dr. Albino,

40:52.659 --> 40:55.287
are you saying that those of a nervous
disposition should leave immediately,

40:55.370 --> 40:58.340
in case the sheer unexpected
remarkableness of my discovery

40:58.414 --> 41:00.257
should cause their hearts to explode?

41:04.379 --> 41:05.426
I am.

41:05.505 --> 41:08.725
Well, science lovers, you have been warned.

41:08.883 --> 41:12.513
This is our most educational adventure ever.

41:18.059 --> 41:20.357
Back from the dead.

41:20.436 --> 41:22.530
Back from beyond the grave.

41:23.523 --> 41:26.402
Back to astound you all.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.365
The ninth wonder of the world.

41:28.444 --> 41:32.165
She's travelled halfway
across the globe to be here tonight.

41:32.240 --> 41:36.040
Here's Polly!

41:37.620 --> 41:39.668
It's a dodo.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.296
By Jove.

41:45.962 --> 41:48.590
That is astounding!

41:54.595 --> 41:56.597
An actual dodo!

41:56.764 --> 42:00.143
Makes electricity look like a pile of crap.

42:06.607 --> 42:09.486
The Royal Society's prize

42:09.569 --> 42:12.789
for best scientific discovery...

42:13.114 --> 42:14.240
I hope it's not a cheque.

42:14.323 --> 42:16.371
...Is awarded to...

42:16.451 --> 42:17.873
Have you any idea
what the sterling-doubloon

42:17.952 --> 42:19.044
exchange rate is these days?

42:19.120 --> 42:21.418
...The Scientist Captain.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.257
Thank you, thank you.

42:23.332 --> 42:24.504
You're too kind.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.177
Please stop. Enough. Thank you.

42:26.294 --> 42:27.466
Thank you.

42:33.134 --> 42:34.181
Is that it?

42:34.260 --> 42:35.307
Oh, no.

42:35.428 --> 42:37.522
- Good.
- You also get

42:37.638 --> 42:41.518
this leather-bound set of encyclopaedias.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.696
Excuse me just one moment. Thank you.

42:46.981 --> 42:47.982
Okay, Chuck.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.319
Now, I like encyclopaedias
as much as the next man,

42:50.651 --> 42:53.905
but they're not exactly gonna help me win
Pirate of the Year, are they?

42:55.490 --> 42:56.457
Where's the booty?

42:56.532 --> 42:58.330
Booty? What booty?

42:58.409 --> 43:02.004
The prize! The "untold riches," remember?

43:03.623 --> 43:05.546
Perhaps I didn't explain.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.377
It's not all about money.

43:07.668 --> 43:09.841
No, the real prize is...

43:09.921 --> 43:12.219
Her Royal Majesty, the Empress of India,

43:12.423 --> 43:14.596
Ruler of the Kingdom of Java...

43:14.675 --> 43:16.928
...a personal audience with...
-...Defender of the Faith,

43:17.053 --> 43:18.896
- Queen Victoria!
- Queen Victoria

43:19.305 --> 43:20.431
herself.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.131
Scientist Captain,

43:49.293 --> 43:51.045
congratulations.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.381
What a tremendous discovery.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.716
Your... Your Majesty.

43:54.841 --> 43:57.936
And who are these charming fellows?

43:58.010 --> 44:01.480
- Well, this is my crew.
- By which he means lab assistant crew.

44:01.556 --> 44:04.275
Yes, yes.
I'm using "crew" in the street sense.

44:04.350 --> 44:05.602
Yo.

44:05.726 --> 44:08.149
And I'm Charles Darwin, Your Majesty.

44:08.229 --> 44:11.028
I helped find the dodo.

44:11.107 --> 44:12.654
Yes, whatever.

44:12.733 --> 44:15.657
But where has your
delightful creature disappeared to?

44:15.736 --> 44:17.784
Resting, ma'am. Hidden away.

44:17.864 --> 44:20.287
I only let her out
for the big performance, I'm afraid.

44:20.366 --> 44:23.495
In case sinister forces
should try to make off with her, you see.

44:23.578 --> 44:25.000
Sinister forces?

44:25.079 --> 44:26.456
Dean

44:26.539 --> 44:30.419
Well, we have a wonderful
petting zoo at the palace

44:30.501 --> 44:32.845
where Polly would be quite safe.

44:33.254 --> 44:34.722
Perhaps we could

44:35.506 --> 44:37.508
take her off your hands.

44:38.634 --> 44:41.057
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but that's out of the question.

44:41.137 --> 44:42.514
But she'd have a lovely time.

44:42.597 --> 44:46.272
There are guinea pigs and a donkey.

44:46.350 --> 44:47.602
No, no, I couldn't, ma'am.

44:47.768 --> 44:51.818
Not even for little old me?

44:51.898 --> 44:53.616
No, no, no, I'm afraid not, ma'am.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.035
No, you see,
there is nothing more important to a pirate

44:56.110 --> 44:57.657
than his trusted dodo.

44:57.737 --> 45:00.661
She is the feathery
heart and soul of the boat.

45:01.991 --> 45:03.413
Did you say...

45:06.329 --> 45:07.421
..."pirate"?

45:08.956 --> 45:10.879
Pirate? No, no, no, no, no.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.335
Scientist.

45:12.418 --> 45:15.046
Yes, good old, good old science.
Can't get enough of it.

45:15.129 --> 45:16.381
Mixing stuff together.

45:16.464 --> 45:18.466
You know, test tube tubing
and Bunsen burning.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.051
See?

45:22.553 --> 45:24.396
He's no scientist!

45:24.472 --> 45:26.474
He's a Girl Guide!

45:28.768 --> 45:30.145
He's no Girl Guide!

45:30.686 --> 45:32.154
- He's a pirate!
- Pirate!

45:35.191 --> 45:36.408
Hang on, hang on.

45:36.484 --> 45:37.827
There's been some kind of mistake. Some...

45:38.986 --> 45:40.533
Some silly mistake. Whoa, laddies!

45:40.613 --> 45:42.536
Stop, stop. I can explain.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.349
Your Majesty.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.222
He's hidden the dodo.

46:02.301 --> 46:03.427
If you chop his head off now,

46:03.594 --> 46:05.346
we might never find out where.

46:05.846 --> 46:06.847
Wait a mo.

46:18.526 --> 46:20.620
One doesn't know why.

46:20.695 --> 46:24.871
Perhaps it's his luxuriant beard
or his gleaming teeth

46:25.032 --> 46:27.956
or the way he smells faintly of coconuts.

46:28.035 --> 46:31.130
But we have taken a shine to this pirate.

46:31.414 --> 46:34.668
Do you have a name, pirate captain?

46:35.042 --> 46:38.012
They call me the Pirate Captain.

46:38.379 --> 46:40.347
Well, Pirate Captain,

46:40.423 --> 46:44.178
we hereby pardon you
of your piratical crimes.

46:49.181 --> 46:51.024
You will stay in London, Pirate Captain,

46:51.100 --> 46:53.899
and entertain us
with your stories and your wit.

46:54.562 --> 46:56.564
And especially

46:56.772 --> 47:01.448
your dear little dodo.

47:05.573 --> 47:06.665
Hell's barnacles.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.414
Can we please get out of here now?

47:08.492 --> 47:10.085
That was a bit close for comfort,
Number Two.

47:10.244 --> 47:13.293
I will get you the dodo, Your Majesty.

47:13.372 --> 47:15.750
See that you do, Mr Darwin.

47:21.881 --> 47:23.508
Captain?

47:23.674 --> 47:25.768
Captain! Captain!

47:26.093 --> 47:27.845
Hurry up, lads, chop-chop.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.305
Let's get back to sea where we belong.

47:29.388 --> 47:31.106
Ave, aye, Captain!

47:31.265 --> 47:32.687
I told you coming to London was a bad idea.

47:32.767 --> 47:34.144
The sooner I get the smell of brine in my...

47:34.226 --> 47:35.603
Captain!

47:35.936 --> 47:37.358
Captain!

47:37.438 --> 47:38.781
Whoa!

47:40.566 --> 47:42.318
You're not leaving, surely?

47:43.069 --> 47:44.412
I most certainly am.

47:44.487 --> 47:45.955
You've let me down badly, Charles.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.748
Look! Look!

47:47.823 --> 47:48.915
- Also, to be frank...
- Captain...

47:48.991 --> 47:50.789
...your nose is too small for your face.

47:51.118 --> 47:52.870
But you're the toast of London Town.

47:56.999 --> 47:58.296
I say, look at that.

47:59.794 --> 48:01.296
They've really captured my eyes.

48:01.420 --> 48:04.469
We were hoping
you might come out for a little

48:04.548 --> 48:06.926
celebration before you go.

48:09.095 --> 48:11.974
We don't want to miss the tide, Captain.

48:12.056 --> 48:14.104
- No, no, no. Quite right, quite right.
- Captain,

48:14.558 --> 48:16.981
do join us, please?

48:18.229 --> 48:20.982
I'll just stop for a quick one. Rude to refuse.

48:21.065 --> 48:22.567
- But it's Ham Night.
- I'll be 20 minutes.

48:22.650 --> 48:23.742
Half an hour tops.

48:23.818 --> 48:25.695
Just get her...
Get her warmed up without me.

48:25.778 --> 48:26.825
Aren't we going yet?

48:27.655 --> 48:29.999
But what about winning the Pirate of the Year

48:30.074 --> 48:32.577
and showing all those other captains
that he's not a loser?

48:40.835 --> 48:43.304
Yoo-hoo! Come along, Captain.

48:43.379 --> 48:44.676
Captain...

48:45.214 --> 48:46.591
- Cheers!
- Good evening.

48:46.674 --> 48:48.347
Thank you. Thank you so very much.

48:48.426 --> 48:49.769
- Captain...
- And your name is?

48:49.844 --> 48:50.845
Miss Jane Austen.

48:57.059 --> 49:00.563
And that, and that is why, in a straight fight,

49:00.646 --> 49:03.525
a shark would probably beat a Dracula.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.949
Jane Austen,
feel free to use it in one of your books.

49:07.027 --> 49:10.372
Pirate Captain, you are a born raconteur.

49:10.656 --> 49:14.081
So much better
than the last chap we all went doolally over.

49:14.243 --> 49:17.873
You've all been terribly kind.

49:19.039 --> 49:20.131
Do run along.

49:20.207 --> 49:21.880
Another drink, Captain?

49:22.626 --> 49:24.720
Cheers, Chuck.

49:25.921 --> 49:27.923
I say, you're not

49:28.215 --> 49:30.559
-related in some way, are you?
- Pardon?

49:31.510 --> 49:32.557
It's just you, sort of...

49:33.262 --> 49:35.481
Well, no, no, nothing, nothing, nothing.

49:35.556 --> 49:37.229
Cheers.

49:45.900 --> 49:48.028
Do you know what I've discovered, Charles?

49:48.110 --> 49:50.784
The friends you make
after you've become famous

49:50.863 --> 49:52.831
are better, truer friends

49:52.907 --> 49:54.955
than the ones you've had
for years beforehand.

49:55.034 --> 49:57.036
So very wise.

49:59.079 --> 50:00.752
But the lads will think I'm a fool.

50:00.831 --> 50:03.584
No. A fool, you?

50:03.667 --> 50:05.761
You're an intellectual giant.

50:05.836 --> 50:08.464
Just look at how
you managed to keep Polly safe

50:08.547 --> 50:10.265
from those sinister forces.

50:10.341 --> 50:11.843
Yes, I did do that, didn't I?

50:11.926 --> 50:13.553
You did.

50:13.636 --> 50:15.855
And wherever she's hidden,

50:15.930 --> 50:18.353
I bet it's somewhere really ingenious.

50:18.432 --> 50:19.433
It is rather.

50:21.352 --> 50:22.774
You'll never guess where.

50:22.853 --> 50:25.857
Well, no, why,
you're too smart for me, Captain.

50:25.940 --> 50:28.034
Right under everyone's noses.

50:28.108 --> 50:30.611
Or right under my noses, anyhow.

50:33.280 --> 50:34.782
Ta-da!

50:37.618 --> 50:40.963
You've been keeping Polly in your beard?

50:41.121 --> 50:43.249
Actually, I keep all sorts in here.

50:45.793 --> 50:46.965
I'm sorry about this, Captain.

50:47.044 --> 50:48.466
About what?

50:50.381 --> 50:52.179
What the...
What's the monkey-man playing at?

50:54.134 --> 50:56.136
This patently isn't even a real...

51:05.729 --> 51:07.857
Come back here, you lubbers!

51:13.612 --> 51:15.330
Sorry, Your Reverence.

51:31.171 --> 51:33.014
Got you, you rogue!

51:39.888 --> 51:41.561
Yeah, that's rather nice.

51:44.018 --> 51:45.645
Neptune's lips, what are you up to?

51:45.811 --> 51:47.154
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's not my fault.

51:47.229 --> 51:48.822
What do you mean "not your fault"?

51:48.897 --> 51:51.491
You steal Polly,
you shoot my best hat full of holes.

52:10.085 --> 52:11.211
Well, go on, then.

52:11.629 --> 52:12.972
Explain yourself.

52:14.465 --> 52:16.012
There's this girl.

52:16.091 --> 52:18.389
I'm hopelessly smitten with her.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.142
I'm listening.

52:20.220 --> 52:24.066
I know how partial she is to exotic animals,

52:24.141 --> 52:26.894
and I thought if I could get her the dodo,

52:26.977 --> 52:30.447
then she might like me.

52:32.399 --> 52:34.401
I'm so ashamed.

52:34.693 --> 52:36.570
Why didn't you say so?

52:37.071 --> 52:39.665
We've all done stupid things to impress girls.

52:39.740 --> 52:41.287
Yeah, you should act aloof.

52:41.367 --> 52:43.745
They love it when you act aloof.

52:43.827 --> 52:46.000
Still, must be quite a girl
for you to go to all that trouble.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.754
She is quite a girl.

52:50.084 --> 52:51.802
Kraken's biscuits!

52:52.753 --> 52:54.426
Mr Darwin.

52:57.257 --> 52:58.304
Honestly, Charles.

52:58.592 --> 53:02.017
It's the bun. The bun really does it for me.

53:02.096 --> 53:03.689
And I see you've brought a friend.

53:04.014 --> 53:05.061
HOW delightful.

53:05.140 --> 53:07.268
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

53:07.351 --> 53:10.525
Oh, get a grip, man. You couldn't
manage one tiny task, could you?

53:10.604 --> 53:12.606
It's pathetic.

53:40.467 --> 53:44.768
Listen, Captain, I can see
I've gone about this all wrong.

53:46.765 --> 53:50.895
You see, I might have the body
of a weak and feeble woman,

53:53.021 --> 53:57.822
but I have the heart and soul of a person
who really, really wants that dodo.

54:18.172 --> 54:24.521
I seem to recall that you piratical types
have a bit of a soft spot for shiny things.

54:24.678 --> 54:27.602
Or am I getting you
muddled up with magpies?

54:27.681 --> 54:29.809
I couldn't.

54:29.892 --> 54:32.691
I mean, Polly, she's a family...

54:32.853 --> 54:35.402
Come now, Captain, it's so simple.

54:35.898 --> 54:38.276
Polly here could live like
a queen at my petting zoo,

54:38.358 --> 54:41.988
and you... Well...

54:42.821 --> 54:45.324
With treasure like this,

54:45.699 --> 54:50.079
you could be famed across the seven seas.

54:54.541 --> 54:55.667
<i>Captain.</i>

54:55.751 --> 54:58.095
<i>Polly's not for sale.</i>

55:00.088 --> 55:02.216
<i>You? Win Pirate of the Year?</i>

55:02.299 --> 55:03.767
<i>You're a shoo-in, sir.</i>

55:03.842 --> 55:06.846
<i>There's not a pirate
on the seven seas can match you.</i>

55:06.929 --> 55:08.931
<i>But what about winning Pirate of the Year</i>

55:09.014 --> 55:11.984
<i>and showing all those other captains
that you're not a loser?</i>

55:12.059 --> 55:14.608
Loser... Loser...

55:16.814 --> 55:19.567
<i>I'm a floating head.</i>

55:20.484 --> 55:22.031
So, Captain,

55:22.653 --> 55:25.907
are you going to do the right thing?

55:30.327 --> 55:34.457
<i>I'm sailing out on the ocean</i>

55:34.540 --> 55:36.417
<i>Out on the deep blue sea</i>

55:37.668 --> 55:40.296
20 minutes, he said.

55:40.379 --> 55:41.972
Didn't he say 20 minutes?

55:42.089 --> 55:43.341
Don't worry, lads.

55:43.423 --> 55:44.925
He probably just got caught up,

55:46.009 --> 55:47.056
you know,

55:47.219 --> 55:49.768
battling a giant squid or something.

55:58.939 --> 56:00.361
Well, come on, you lubbers!

56:00.440 --> 56:01.566
It's him!

56:01.650 --> 56:02.822
I told you!

56:02.901 --> 56:05.199
I... I told you he wouldn't let us down.

56:05.279 --> 56:06.531
Hello, boys.

56:07.531 --> 56:09.033
Miss me?

56:09.157 --> 56:11.205
I'm having a mirage.

56:11.285 --> 56:13.834
But... How?

56:13.912 --> 56:15.038
Good question, Number Two.

56:15.122 --> 56:18.501
I stole it all in a daring raid
on the Tower of London.

56:18.709 --> 56:23.590
You stole all this from the Tower of London?

56:23.672 --> 56:24.719
That's right.

56:24.798 --> 56:26.926
Then I burnt it to the ground,
wrestled a bear,

56:27.134 --> 56:29.136
and I kissed a princess for good measure.

56:30.053 --> 56:32.932
Well, what are you waiting for?
Don't just stand there like porpoises.

56:33.015 --> 56:34.312
There's a trophy with our names on it!

56:37.311 --> 56:39.484
Set a course for Blood Island!

56:44.526 --> 56:46.494
<i>Avast, me hearties!</i>

56:46.653 --> 56:51.910
<i>And welcome to the
59th Annual Pirate of the YearAwards!</i>

57:10.385 --> 57:12.103
This is the ticket, eh, Number Two?

57:12.179 --> 57:14.227
Please, please, please,
can't Polly come out now?

57:14.765 --> 57:17.018
Best not.

57:17.726 --> 57:18.978
She's still very tired.

57:19.061 --> 57:20.688
<i>- And here is your host for the evening...
- Shush.</i>

57:20.979 --> 57:24.483
<i>The Pirate King!</i>

57:28.779 --> 57:32.454
Hello, Pirates!

57:32.532 --> 57:34.205
Hello, Pirate King!

57:34.368 --> 57:35.961
Any lubbers in tonight?

57:36.036 --> 57:37.458
No!

57:42.167 --> 57:43.384
Behind you!

57:45.003 --> 57:45.970
I'm Queen Victoria!

57:46.046 --> 57:47.844
And I hate pirates!

57:51.176 --> 57:52.519
Come on, cheer up.

57:52.594 --> 57:54.471
And now, you swabs,

57:54.554 --> 57:57.774
this is the big one.

57:57.891 --> 58:02.488
The nominees for Pirate
of the Year are as follows:

58:02.562 --> 58:05.281
Black Bellamy.

58:05.440 --> 58:07.442
Cutlass Liz.

58:07.567 --> 58:09.820
Peg-Leg Hastings.

58:09.987 --> 58:13.412
And a surprise late entry,

58:13.573 --> 58:15.667
the Pirate Captain!

58:16.785 --> 58:20.961
The panel of independentjudges

58:21.081 --> 58:24.176
have counted each
pirate's booty and declared

58:24.960 --> 58:27.930
that this year's winner is

58:29.256 --> 58:32.305
the Pirate Captain!

59:20.307 --> 59:21.900
Excuse me!

59:23.351 --> 59:25.695
Excuse me.

59:25.854 --> 59:27.948
Listen, this is all very moving.

59:28.023 --> 59:30.071
I'm welling up here, but...

59:30.233 --> 59:32.827
Bellamy, this is most irregular!

59:33.403 --> 59:35.155
So is this!

59:42.788 --> 59:48.841
It seems Queen Victoria has
pardoned the Pirate Captain.

59:49.544 --> 59:50.841
No!

59:52.506 --> 59:53.553
So what if she did?

59:53.632 --> 59:55.259
If you've been pardoned,

59:55.425 --> 59:58.144
then, technically, you're no longer a pirate.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:00.680
And if you're no longer a pirate,

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:04.151
you really can't be Pirate of the Year,

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.103
now, can you?

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:08.735
- No, you can't!
- That's right!

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.365
Is this true?

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:14.199
Well, that's one, frankly,
rather negative way of looking at it.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:18.286
Villainous treachery!

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:21.244
Treacherous villainy!

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:24.296
You have betrayed the pirating fraternity.

01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:26.039
But, Pirate King...

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:28.629
Your pirate hat and coat!

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:46.606
Your pirate badge with googly eyes.

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:50.906
And your World of Hooks discount card.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:52.695
Confiscate his treasure!

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:55.402
Every last bit of it.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:59.244
Begone!
May your lubber shame bear down upon you.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:02.831
You are hereby banished from Blood Island!

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:08.173
You are a pirate no more!

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:19.935
And stay out!

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:27.188
Yes, well, not a... Not a total success.

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:29.941
We don't need them and their stupid awards.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.069
The best thing about being
a pirate isn't the treasure.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:35.025
- It's the cutlasses.
- It's Ham Night.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:36.826
It's Polly.

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:39.576
Where is Polly, Captain?

01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:41.622
What do you mean? You know where she is.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:44.042
She's been upset enough.

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:45.164
Captain...

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:50.465
Okay, okay.

01:01:58.006 --> 01:02:01.556
I sold her to Queen Victoria
for a boatload of treasure.

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:04.229
There, I've said it.

01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:14.648
Well, come on. She was just a parrot.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.449
I mean, she wasn't even a parrot.

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:18.822
Always weeing on the boat's carpets,
biting everyone.

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.621
She gave half of us tetanus,
for goodness sake.

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:24.332
But she was our Polly.

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.660
Well, you know, you should be happy for her.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.121
She'll be, she'll be living the high life.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:34.092
Eating gold bricks wrapped up in,
you know, swans.

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:40.181
Well, where are you swabs going? Come on.

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:44.307
Well, we'll have an adventure
somewhere tropical with those native ladies

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:47.435
whose outfits
don't leave much to the imagination.

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:53.195
Looks like it's
just you and me now, eh, Number Two?

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.610
Good old inseparable you and me.

01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:57.282
Us two against the world, eh?

01:02:57.357 --> 01:02:58.324
Yeah?

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.949
Like serrano ham and,

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:03.701
you know, that other kind of ham.

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:06.200
Arrr.

01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:11.835
You can't always
just say "arrr" at the end of a sentence

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:15.042
and think that makes everything all right.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.563
Fine. Fine, go on, then. Go.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:30.398
Go!

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:34.228
It's not like I need any of you, anyway.

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:37.196
See if I care.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.828
See if I care.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.097
You're too late.

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:33.100
She's gone.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:34.351
Charles?

01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:35.640
Is that you?

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:37.145
What are you doing here?

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:40.855
We're tramps now.
It's not unlike being a scientist, but...

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:44.320
...with less experiments
and more drinking your own sweat.

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:47.528
But where's Polly?
Why isn't she in her cage?

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:50.454
It's too horrible.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:53.040
"Banquet for world leaders"?

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:54.576
I've been a fool for love.

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:57.208
Victoria never wanted
Polly for her petting zoo.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:00.541
"Terrine of Tiger, Black Rhino Ragout,

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:02.709
"Panda Face Fritters"?

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:06.012
I've discovered the Queen
is a member of a terrible secret

01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:07.805
<i>dining society.</i>

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.555
<i>Kings, queens, emperors from
around the world,</i>

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.386
<i>they meet on her flagship, the</i> QV1,

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:18.980
to eat the rarest and most
endangered creatures they can find.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:21.277
This year, the highlight is...

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:24.898
"Dodo Ã© I'Orange"?

01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:27.367
She's going to eat Polly?

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:28.694
It's all my fault.

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:31.199
I'm an awful human being.
I'll never get a girlfriend.

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:34.658
Now pull yourself together, man.

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:37.335
Now listen, Charles,
we've all done something unforgivable.

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.003
I've betrayed my pirate honour,

01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:42.423
you've betrayed science,
and Mr Bebe's betrayed the animal kingdom.

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:44.675
- We've got to rescue her.
- Us?

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:47.971
Against the crowned heads
of the world on an impregnable warship?

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:49.426
It's impossible odds!

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:51.600
It's only impossible
if you stop to think about it.

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:53.096
Come on, we didn't evolve from slugs

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:55.645
just to sit here
drinking our own sweat, now, did we?

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.812
Are you with us, Mr Bobo?

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:02.769
Oh, I say.

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:04.195
Well, pah!

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:05.692
We can do without the monkey-man.

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:07.490
Sorry, what was that about slugs?

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:10.444
No time for that now. Come on.

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:16.416
Prepare to be boarded, nerds.

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:30.463
It's true! You can see down ladies' tops.

01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:32.761
Keep pedalling, Charles.

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:37.516
Help!

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.264
Neptune's nostrils. Not a thing.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.720
Where the devil can she be?

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:21.727
Captain?

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:28.984
Pedal faster, Chuck!

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:38.786
But how on earth do we get on board?

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.501
This might sting a bit.

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:42.828
I really don't...

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:45.330
Catch hold of something!

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:46.710
Good man.

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:59.595
How do you like my pygmy
elephant nuggets, Your Majesty?

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.604
They're good, but not quite

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.774
rare enough for my tastes.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:06.066
Not rare enough?

01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:08.611
Only three have been seen
in the last 50 years.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:10.898
As many as three?

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.197
Well, well.

01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:15.868
Just wait until you see what
I've got for the main course.

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:17.987
Gaston?

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:19.368
Gaston?

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.374
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:22.450
Oui, Your Majesty.

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:23.500
<i>Gaston, I think</i>

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:25.419
-we're ready.
- Neptune's teeth.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.335
There's not a moment to lose.
We've got to find that kitchen.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:31.008
But it's hopeless.
Where do we even start to...

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:34.636
So that's why I reckon,
in a straight fight, a shark

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:36.589
-would probably beat a Dracula.
- No!

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:39.801
Course, a Frankenstein versus a jellyfish,

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:41.719
well, that's a different matter.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.103
All clear, Chuck.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.772
Chuck?

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:52.274
It's all right, Charles, I'm coming!

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.742
- Don't worry, I'll just...
- Charles?

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:58.282
Just... Just hang on!

01:10:01.406 --> 01:10:02.953
Charles?

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.704
Poseidon's lips!

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:09.881
Are you all right, Charles?

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:13.467
Hey, you there!

01:10:13.668 --> 01:10:14.885
What are you doing here?

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:17.180
Well, now. Excellent question.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:20.350
All exotic animals should have been
delivered to the chef by now.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:21.759
- What?
- What is it?

01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:22.969
Some sort of duck?

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:26.348
Yes, yes. That's it, yes.

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:29.104
Quack, quack.

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:30.525
Hurry up, then. Kitchen's that way.

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:32.403
Yeah, come away! Go on.

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:33.479
Quack, quack.

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:37.568
Here we go, my Pretty

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:40.612
It's time to be...

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.374
<i>...dÃ©licieuxl</i>

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:48.832
<i>Mon dieu!</i>

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:57.966
Polly, come to Daddy.

01:10:58.045 --> 01:11:00.264
I'm sorry, old girl.

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:03.183
I will never, ever leave you again. I promise.

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:05.683
I will never leave you.

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:08.890
Perhaps we'd best make a move.

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:12.602
Yes, yes, yes, of course.
Back to the balloon.

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:13.686
<i>Gaston ?</i>

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:15.028
<i>Gaston ?</i>

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:17.444
<i>Hello?</i>

01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:20.360
Captain. No.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.658
Hello, Your Majesty.

01:11:22.737 --> 01:11:26.037
<i>The dodo is coming tout de suite.</i>

01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:29.127
- This really <i>isn't wise.
- Claudette est dans Ia bibliotheque.</i>

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:30.203
<i>Please, I think</i> we...

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:33.381
But you know, Your Majesty,
you cannot hurry the cooking.

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:35.834
<i>Is a very delicate recipe, uh?</i>

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:39.588
And the dodo is a very fattening dish.

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:41.047
Perhaps is not so good for you.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.929
And, you know, the calories,
they will go straight to your chubby thighs.

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.726
- Captain.
- A minute on the lips

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:46.894
is a lifetime on the...

01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:48.889
<i>Zut alors!</i>

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:50.147
Well, well.

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:52.066
Pirate Captain.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.812
Here you are again. And...

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:57.272
Oh, mY-

01:11:57.438 --> 01:12:00.533
Is that Mr Darwin behind those feathers?

01:12:00.608 --> 01:12:01.609
Hello.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:04.992
What a delightfully unexpected surprise.

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:09.204
You know, I think, secretly...

01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:14.172
...I've always loved you, Charles.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:16.336
Gosh.

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:18.130
Really?

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:19.877
No!

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:26.596
Give me my dodo!

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:29.600
Now, come on, Vickie, be sensible.

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:31.730
It's just you, a tiny queen,

01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:34.730
against me, a dashing terror of the high seas.

01:12:34.809 --> 01:12:36.686
<i>En garde!</i>

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:37.861
Oh, dear!

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:39.905
Poor defenceless me.

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:43.276
What is a girl to do?

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:48.197
Now, steady on.

01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:51.541
Now careful.

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:53.961
Do you know why I really hate pirates?

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.121
Childhood trauma, was it?

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.298
Bitten by a pirate when you were a baby?

01:12:58.583 --> 01:12:59.550
Beard envy?

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.673
It's because you're out-of-date.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:03.546
You're dinosaurs!

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.808
All that "romance of the seas" guff!

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.145
Right, where were we?

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:21.318
Look at you.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.982
You should be extinct.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:29.739
Along with your little friend!

01:13:43.878 --> 01:13:45.221
Pity you can't eat pirates, really.

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:52.721
But you'd probably taste of barnacles.

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:56.858
Whereas, dear little Polly here is going to be

01:13:57.058 --> 01:14:02.155
absolutely delicious!

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:06.863
Mr Bobo?

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:10.704
Give me back my dinner!

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:13.454
- Captain, catch!
- Number Two!

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:18.917
Sorry, Vickie.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.424
Dodo is off the menu.

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:30.550
No, no, stop!

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:34.558
Stop!

01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:39.813
Stop!

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:45.774
I'm being squashed
by giant barrels of vinegar!

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:54.286
Good work, Chuck.

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:55.745
Number Two, what are you doing here?

01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:57.789
How did you find me? Where are the lads?

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:00.038
Don't worry, they're on the case.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:08.091
It's all thanks to Mr Bobo here.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:11.049
He rowed halfway across the ocean
to tell us what you were up to.

01:15:11.298 --> 01:15:14.347
And, you know, I figured you

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:16.771
tend to end up wrapped in
sausages facing certain death

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.689
at about this point in an adventure.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:20.061
Yes.

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:22.360
Yeah.

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:23.937
Yes.

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:27.732
Listen, Number Two, I...

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:30.576
I realise I let you down.

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:36.199
Sorry.

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:37.625
I let everybody down.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:40.582
You know, I've...

01:15:40.745 --> 01:15:44.500
Well, I've done some pretty appalling things
in my piratical career.

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:47.506
Like that time I used babies as squid bait.

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.675
Or that other time I thought it would be

01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:51.965
okay to let a turtle drive the boat.

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:53.966
But the thing is...

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:56.306
I mean, what I'm trying to say is...

01:15:56.802 --> 01:16:00.181
You decided to single-handedly take on
Queen Victoria's flagship,

01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:01.766
in order to rescue Polly.

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:04.397
Yes, I'm afraid I did.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:09.608
That's terrifically idiotic.

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:10.821
Yes.

01:16:11.025 --> 01:16:14.529
It's also the reason why me and the lads,

01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:17.244
Well, We Still think

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:20.497
you're the best pirate on the seven sea...

01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:32.088
Gadzooks!

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:34.348
No!

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:53.025
Polly!

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:55.194
Oh, no, you don't.

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.324
Captain?

01:17:05.913 --> 01:17:09.008
Kiss your beaky little friend goodbye.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.063
That's it, Polly. Snip-snip.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:32.399
Come on, little dodo. Bitey-bite.

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.317
The dumpy lady's got Polly!

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:35.989
Snip-snip.

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:38.495
Bite it!

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:40.285
Bite it, you stupid bird!

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:42.204
Bite it!

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:50.174
No!

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:51.592
My dodo!

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:52.759
Polly!

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:54.966
My dinner!

01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:11.938
Barnacles.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.551
Well done, sir.

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:34.593
Hey!

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:36.295
Wah-hey, Captain!

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.303
Fair play to you, sir.

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:42.184
Wah-hey!

01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:49.108
This is our most unexpectedly
heartwarming adventure ever.

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:51.652
You'll swing for this! Curse you!

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:55.072
And after you've done swinging,
I'll chop your head off!

01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:57.900
I'll put it in a cannon and fire it into the sun!

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.486
Does that mean he's not pardoned any more?

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.196
"Pardoned"?

01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:07.286
You'll be outlawed across the globe!

01:19:07.368 --> 01:19:10.998
There'll be a higher price
on your head than any pirate before you!

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:15.634
The whole world will know your name!

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.340
Welcome back,

01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:23.343
Captain.

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:49.835
- See ya!
- Bye!

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:51.708
Bye-bye!

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:03.469
Well, it's been a pleasure, Charles.

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:05.222
Good luck with the science.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:07.978
- Thank you, Captain.
- And just a little tip,

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:09.521
grow yourself a beard.

01:20:09.596 --> 01:20:11.223
It'll make your face look less lumpy.

01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:34.171
100,000 doubloons.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:37.833
Not bad, eh, Mr Bobo?

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:54.854
That... I...

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:58.570
- Is this a bit of squid tentacle?
- Yeah.

01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:00.192
And that's my earwax.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:08.288
I keep telling you, it's never been about
the trophies or the treasure.

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.913
It's about who you are, inside.

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:13.953
I say, you're not...

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:16.414
Not a woman
disguised as a man, are you, Number Two?

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:17.544
No.

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:19.967
Because that does happen
surprisingly often at sea.

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:40.730
<i>Well, come on, you coves.</i>

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:42.856
Those treasure chests
won't plunder themselves.

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.237
Hoist the flag!

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:46.410
Ave, aye, Captain!

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:49.409
Set a course for adventure!

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:11.760
You see? I told you.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:13.061
Didn't <i>I</i> tell you?

01:22:13.137 --> 01:22:15.811
Just added on for decoration, my foot.

01:23:13.137 --> 01:24:15.811
