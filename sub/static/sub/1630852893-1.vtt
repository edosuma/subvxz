00:16.933 --> 00:21.062


00:38.788 --> 00:41.041
-Just left. Left.
-It's just boring.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.126
-Trying to jazz it up a bit.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.464
The hearing will start in five minutes.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.466
I need to collect your phones
before you testify.

00:49.549 --> 00:53.178
Dad, I'm in a hearing at the Pentagon.
Space Force is on trial.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.263
Space Force is where I work, Dad.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.307
I've told you that a whole bunch of times.

00:57.807 --> 01:00.185
Uh, no, I don't know
if there's a Bonefish Grill here.

01:00.268 --> 01:01.811
I think that's a Florida thing.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.606
I will try the crab legs
if I ever get over there.

01:04.689 --> 01:06.816
All right, I gotta go. I love you--

01:08.860 --> 01:09.944
Sir, your phone.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.905
-You got it.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.490
-Now? Sure.
-Mm-hmm.

01:15.658 --> 01:18.119
Sorry about that.
Oh my God. Are you seeing this?

01:19.621 --> 01:22.123
Look at this. My hand
is actually cramped on top of the phone.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.793
-Maybe it's easier if I keep it.
-Just give her the phone, son.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.337
-How will I be able to tell time?
-I have a watch.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.131
-Why didn't you give her your phone?
-Because I'm a four-star general.

01:31.132 --> 01:34.094
-How will I be able to know about things?
-You can do this, buddy.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.179
-We believe in you.
-Yeah, I know.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.891
Thank you. Sorry about that. Here you go.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.894
-Just…
-I can't do it.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.395
For fuck's sake. Come on.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.899
General Naird, please follow me.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.567
Mr. Secretary, first of all,

01:49.651 --> 01:52.946
I would just like to say congratulations
on your new position,

01:53.029 --> 01:54.781
and I'd like to say

01:54.864 --> 01:59.452
that I am eager to work with both you
and the new administration going forward.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.329
We'll see.

02:01.871 --> 02:06.000
Our job today is to decide whether
Space Force should continue to exist

02:06.084 --> 02:08.294
and under whose command.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.796
So, uh, General Naird,

02:09.879 --> 02:14.342
can you recount
with the utmost detail and precision,

02:15.385 --> 02:18.304
uh, your recollection of what happened
on the day in question?

02:18.388 --> 02:19.722
Yes, sir.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.560
Well, the day started as most do.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.062
<i>I showered and shaved.</i>

02:26.646 --> 02:29.691
<i>I had an English muffin</i>
<i>with orange marmalade.</i>

02:29.774 --> 02:32.152
No, wait. We'd just run out of marmalade.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.529
Erin! Did you finish all the marmalade?

02:34.612 --> 02:35.613
What?

02:35.697 --> 02:38.199
Did you finish all the marmalade?

02:38.741 --> 02:40.577
Oh yeah. I guess so.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.746
Don't put the empty jar
back in the fridge, please.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.208
-Do we have any other jams or jellies?
-What?

02:47.292 --> 02:52.005
Do we have any other jams or jellies?

02:52.088 --> 02:52.922
-General?
-Yes.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.216
I'm sorry. You were
sort of lost in thought there.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.260
-Can we skip ahead?
-Of course.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.971
-According to General Grabaston's testim--
-Butter.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.389
Huh?

03:01.472 --> 03:05.143
I ended up using butter.
On my muffin. Just as good.

03:06.561 --> 03:10.231
Okay. According to
General Grabaston's testimony,

03:10.315 --> 03:13.568
the Chinese desecrated
the American flag on the moon,

03:13.651 --> 03:18.239
and you were ordered to destroy
the Chinese moon base in retaliation,

03:18.323 --> 03:19.490
and you refused.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.326
-That is correct.
-Ah-ha! Guilty!

03:21.409 --> 03:23.995
He disobeyed a direct order
and fled the premises.

03:24.078 --> 03:27.373
But I soon returned to the base,
where I voluntarily surrendered

03:27.457 --> 03:29.417
into the custody of General Grabaston.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.212
Kick, we have to do something.
The astronauts are running out of air.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.672
Not your problem, traitor.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.090
Is this really necessary?

03:36.174 --> 03:37.842
-You're a flight risk.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.802
But you won't get far
dragging a mini fridge

03:39.886 --> 03:42.555
full of diet cream soda, will ya?

03:44.849 --> 03:46.476
Excuse the reach.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.061
Don't mind if I do.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.606
How can you drink that swill?

03:51.689 --> 03:53.775
With my mouth. Watch and learn.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.568
Oh, ugh!

03:55.652 --> 03:58.488
That's root beer without the complexity.

03:58.571 --> 04:02.242
That is a high-fructose people fattener.

04:02.325 --> 04:06.037
The preferred beverage
in convalescent homes.

04:06.120 --> 04:10.750
There is a reason, Brad,
it was rejected by the marketplace.

04:10.833 --> 04:14.671
That is a Twinkie in a liquid form.

04:14.754 --> 04:19.259
It is buttermilk
passed through a baby's bottom.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.135
-What is happening?

04:21.219 --> 04:25.932
Okay, great. Well, we've established that
cream soda is not to Dr. Mallory's liking.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.851
I believe that was
a stress-related meltdown.

04:28.935 --> 04:32.146
General Grabaston had detained me
and my team against our will.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.357
Oh, pretty little bedtime story, Naird.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.401
That's enough, General Grabaston.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.820
General Naird, are you aware

04:38.903 --> 04:43.616
that General Grabaston has accused you
of false imprisonment and mutiny?

04:43.700 --> 04:44.742
Yes, and yes.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.869
Yes, you are aware?

04:47.662 --> 04:48.705
Yes.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.623
What's the second yes?

04:50.707 --> 04:51.916
That he accuses me.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.252
The rest of that sentence
I totally disagree with.

05:05.179 --> 05:06.180
Oops.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.390
Oh. Sorry.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.560
I saw you vomit into the umbrella plant.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.312
You okay?

05:12.395 --> 05:16.566
Oh, yeah. Um…
Just still, like, adjusting to being back.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.735
Can't sleep.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.405
Earth is very noisy and, like, colorful.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.449
Should we run some more tests?

05:24.532 --> 05:26.242
Neurological, psychological?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.493
Nah. I'm fine.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.870
Yeah, she's fine. She's fine.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.080
It's totally normal behavior
for an astronaut.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.291
I wasn't the same
when I came back from Jamaica.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.668
For weeks,
everything tasted like jerk sauce.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.629
I'm gonna need you to stop comparing
my experience on the moon

05:38.713 --> 05:40.089
with your Jamaican vacation.

05:40.173 --> 05:44.427
One time I got so altitude sick in Vail
that I got hammered off of kombucha.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.804
Yeah, this one girl in my class
got so high one time,

05:46.888 --> 05:48.848
-she walked through a sliding glass door.
-Wow.

05:48.931 --> 05:52.435
Okay, great. So everybody can relate.
Thanks for your input. Thanks.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.271
-Oh!
-Oh, General.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.564
General, how did it go, sir?

05:56.647 --> 05:59.400
Oh, it was fine. Fine.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.028
-Just told 'em the truth.
-Oh no.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.530
-We are totally screwed.
-He can't not tell the truth.

06:04.614 --> 06:08.159
I mean, he was the star witness for
the prosecution at my mom's court case.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.661
Well, honey, I love her,
but your mom is a felon,

06:10.745 --> 06:13.623
and I want you all to tell the truth
when you go in there.

06:13.706 --> 06:18.211
Well, except I bet Grabaston's in there
right now lying through his veneers.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.171
Wait. Those aren't Grabaston's real teeth?

06:20.254 --> 06:22.507
About as real as the truth he's telling.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.133
Oh, that damn liar.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.010
You know what, sir? I'm gonna lie too.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.805
No. No, Brad,
I want you to tell the truth.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.140
Okay. Got it. The truth.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.227
Why are you winking at me, Brad?

06:34.310 --> 06:35.311
I'm not.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.397
You just did it again.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.440
-Did I?
-Yes.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.566
-No. No.
-Hmm.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.901
-Brad.
-Hmm? What?

06:41.984 --> 06:43.820
Promise me
you are going to tell the truth.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.154
The truth. I'll tell the truth.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.119
Now, you've heard Mark Naird say
he's the good guy,

06:51.202 --> 06:52.495
that he should be celebrated

06:52.578 --> 06:56.707
for ignoring an executive order
to attack the Chinese on the moon.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.252
Well, you wanna know
what's wrong with our country today?

07:00.878 --> 07:01.921
Mark Naird.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.297
He's weak.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.426
He wears a size eight shoe.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.679
Can we really trust a man
with the feet of a child?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.305
Good point.

07:13.724 --> 07:17.061
How can you guys just sit still?
Doesn't your skin feel weird? Huh?

07:18.020 --> 07:19.772
I mean, Kick has been in there a while.

07:19.856 --> 07:20.690
I'm guessing.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.859
I don't have my phone
to tell for sure, but…

07:22.942 --> 07:24.986
It's not a good sign.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.404
But not necessarily bad.

07:26.487 --> 07:30.241
I mean, he could be having a heart attack
and somebody's reviving him, you know?

07:30.324 --> 07:32.577
Hey, just wanted to say hello
to "Space Farce."

07:33.119 --> 07:34.579
Hey, don't worry. sweetie.

07:34.662 --> 07:37.248
I'll make sure they put your dad
in a jail cell close to your mom.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.333
-What the hell?
-What is wrong with you?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.002
-Eat poop.
-That's enough, Kick.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.504
Okay, okay, that came out wrong.
What I meant to say was…

07:44.130 --> 07:46.716
it'll make visiting day with your parents
more convenient.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.843
-What's wrong with this guy?

07:48.926 --> 07:50.219
Let me borrow your phone!

07:50.303 --> 07:52.180
-She's a kid, you asshole.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.640
Oh my God.
Is my dad really gonna go to jail?

07:56.184 --> 07:57.894
-Dr. Mallory? You're up.
-Ah.

07:59.395 --> 08:00.980
Do not fret, friends.

08:01.063 --> 08:04.358
Legal proceedings
are a combat of the mind,

08:04.442 --> 08:06.319
and few, if any,

08:06.402 --> 08:10.656
have ever come as generously armed as I.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.450
Yes.

08:12.533 --> 08:15.036
General Grabaston did have a plan,

08:15.119 --> 08:18.915
a nefarious plan, which I overheard.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.292
It was a reckless scheme

08:21.375 --> 08:25.505
to leave American astronauts
to die on the moon.

08:26.047 --> 08:26.881
Hmm.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.675
"Hmm," meaning?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.428
Well, it's your word
against General Grabaston.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.639
Do you have a taped confession?

08:34.722 --> 08:35.890
No.

08:36.682 --> 08:37.975
No, sir, I don't, but…

08:38.518 --> 08:44.065
but Grabaston is a military Neanderthal,

08:44.148 --> 08:45.608
and I'm me.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.027
I'm also a military man, Dr. Mallory.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.655
Proudly served for 23 years.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.324
Does that make me a Neanderthal?

08:53.407 --> 08:54.325
No.

08:54.951 --> 08:59.997
You don't understand.
I have a great respect for Neanderthals.

09:00.081 --> 09:03.918
They were actually
highly sophisticated hominids

09:04.001 --> 09:06.170
capable of symbolic thought.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.966
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, honey.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.011
I'm sorry you got roped into all of this.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.556
Oh, it's okay. I'm glad I'm here.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.807
Yeah, me too.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.311
-So, um,

09:22.937 --> 09:24.897
what happens to me if you go to prison?

09:24.981 --> 09:27.441
Oh, sweetie, I'm not going to prison.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.986
Much like modern Neanderthals

09:30.069 --> 09:34.365
turned the atom itself
into a weapon of war,

09:34.448 --> 09:35.575
for God's…

09:37.868 --> 09:39.203
I'm sorry. I'll…

09:40.079 --> 09:42.373
Perhaps I'll… I should… I'll stop.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.083
No, please, go on.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.543
Okay. Well, fine.

09:45.626 --> 09:49.088
I mean, I will go on,
because then I'm not sorry, actually.

09:49.171 --> 09:54.510
Because it seems to me
that man has not evolved one iota

09:54.594 --> 09:57.722
since he… he was fishtailing…

09:59.307 --> 10:01.225
My brilliant testimony?

10:02.226 --> 10:03.561
I laid an egg.

10:11.694 --> 10:12.945
-Sir?
-Hmm?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.238
If you go to jail,

10:14.780 --> 10:17.533
it would be my honor to take care of Erin.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.828
And don't you worry.
Uncle Brad'll take great care of you.

10:20.911 --> 10:21.871
Mmm.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.501
General Gregory, they're ready for you.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.046
Brad?

10:30.713 --> 10:31.547
That's you.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.258
Oh, right. I forgot I'm a general.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.010
Weird to hear it said out loud.

10:39.388 --> 10:42.141
I tried parasailing once in Cancún,

10:42.224 --> 10:44.393
but the, uh, tow boat
flew me too close to shore,

10:44.477 --> 10:46.646
and I smacked into
the eighth floor of the Royal Mayan.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.230
Oh-ho! Nasty.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.524
I asked about your original testimony.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.109
Oh boy. Uh…

10:52.193 --> 10:54.278
I thought you asked
how I lost my testicle.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.614
General Gregory,
General Grabaston has accused you

10:56.697 --> 11:00.034
of locking him in a bathroom
on the day in question.

11:00.117 --> 11:00.993
Hmm.

11:01.077 --> 11:05.873
Well, I absolutely, positively, 100%

11:06.457 --> 11:07.708
did not do that.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.585
-No?
-No.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.588
Well, maybe this will refresh your memory.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.006
-Hmm?

11:17.218 --> 11:18.844
<i> Get out of my way. Me first.</i>

11:21.180 --> 11:22.014
Oh my God.

11:22.098 --> 11:22.932
<i>Gotcha now.</i>

11:23.015 --> 11:24.975
There's a security cam in the bathroom?

11:25.059 --> 11:25.893
<i> What the fuck?</i>

11:25.976 --> 11:27.561
May I ask how long that's been there, sir?

11:27.645 --> 11:29.647
-That's not the issue.
<i>Hey!</i>

11:29.730 --> 11:31.482
I understand we're
a high-security place, but…

11:31.565 --> 11:33.192
<i>Let me out of here right now!</i>

11:33.275 --> 11:34.193
Wow.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.821
Make it bigger.
Just make it bigger.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.447
How are you holding up?

11:38.531 --> 11:41.283
Fine. Good. Everything's good. Yeah.

11:41.367 --> 11:45.621
You know, they say the first 36 hours
are the toughest, so…

11:45.705 --> 11:47.748
Thirty-six hours?

11:47.832 --> 11:51.460
My nephew, he goes to a summer camp.
For three weeks, they don't have any tech.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.838
So, when he comes home,
he's, like, very open to nature.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.090
-He relates better--
-Fuck your nephew. Fuck your nephew.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.383
-What?
-Tony.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.844
He doesn't know me.
He doesn't know what I'm going through.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.012
Did anybody think
that I like having my phone?

12:02.096 --> 12:04.682
That's not so much of a sin.
I like having my phone on me.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.976
I can stop whenever I want.
It's not even that big a deal.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.853
Okay. Stop now.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.896
I don't wanna… I don't wanna stop.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.358
Why would I wanna stop?
It brings me joy and happiness.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.277
-You want some water, son?
-Fuck water!

12:16.360 --> 12:18.696
What has water
literally ever done for me? It--

12:23.159 --> 12:24.160
Thank you.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.911
I can't believe that worked.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.582
Hey, I brought you
a Tico's pineapple seltzer.

12:29.665 --> 12:30.750
It's a regional favorite.

12:30.833 --> 12:35.087
One of the few
truly worthwhile regional beverages.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.798
That's cool.
No, I have water. So I'm okay.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.049
-Thanks though.
-Oh, cool.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.801
How've you been?

12:40.885 --> 12:42.762
-Um…
-I haven't really talked to you

12:42.845 --> 12:45.431
-since the day you got back from the moon.

12:45.514 --> 12:48.350
That was a pretty intense day, huh?

12:49.018 --> 12:50.352
Yeah. Um…

12:50.436 --> 12:54.273
Yeah, I've just been, you know,
just, like, super busy, so…

12:55.191 --> 12:56.776
Yeah. Busy's good.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.488
Cool.

13:02.072 --> 13:05.785
Wow. I'm picking up on some definite
"you guys did it" vibes, right?

13:05.868 --> 13:07.745
-Tony, get the fuck out of my face.
-What?

13:07.828 --> 13:09.705
Yeah, get the fuck out of here, Tony.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.802
I, uh…
I think Chan and Angela did it.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.553
-"Did it"?
-Yiffed.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.889
Come on. Had sex.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.433
It's not our business
if they yiffed or didn't yiff.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.936
I agree. Gossip is the Devil's telephone.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.103
Thank you, Dear Abby.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.981
Uh, I just don't think that they did it.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.651
They're professionals.
Chan is a scientist.

13:38.734 --> 13:41.070
-What's wrong with Chan?
-What's wrong with scientists?

13:41.153 --> 13:44.907
Nothing. Just don't want a mental image
of my colleagues having sex.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.577
Thanks. Now I'm just picturing different
pairings of people at work having sex.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.372
-Like who?
-Chan on Angela. Brad on Angela.

13:51.455 --> 13:52.414
Brad on Chan.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.292
Brad, Kick. Kick comes back in,
says, "What's up?" to Angela--

13:55.376 --> 13:56.544
Mr. Scarapiducci?

13:58.420 --> 13:59.505
Dr. Mallory?

14:01.882 --> 14:02.967
Showtime, baby.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.804
Oh yeah, Showtime?
Try and top that. I just aced it.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.055
Pow, pow, pow.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.351
Do you think Brad aced it?

14:12.434 --> 14:13.269
No.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.229
Listen, I know what you really want.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.775
You wanna know why General Naird
is the only man for this job,

14:19.859 --> 14:22.027
and I got your answer right here.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.737
-Boom.

14:23.821 --> 14:27.199
General Naird is
the only man who could tell Putin,

14:27.283 --> 14:28.742
"Get scootin'."

14:29.493 --> 14:32.371
The only person who could tell Xi Jinping,

14:32.454 --> 14:33.998
"You can't do that thing."

14:34.081 --> 14:37.209
I like to say, "With General Naird,

14:37.293 --> 14:41.422
the United States will never be scared."

14:41.505 --> 14:44.758
And I would love, if it's okay with you,
to take the opportunity, sir,

14:44.842 --> 14:48.554
to say congratulations on becoming
a grandfather for the second time.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.931
-Where did you get that photo?
-It's what I do.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.808
If it's on the Internet, I can find it.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.101
Really?

14:55.561 --> 14:58.230
Weren't you fired twice by General Naird?

14:58.314 --> 15:00.900
You found… You found that out.
How did you find that out?

15:02.067 --> 15:03.110
It's what <i>I</i> do.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.406
Well, okay, you should know
that General Naird has a bit of a temper,

15:07.489 --> 15:10.284
but if you whine hard enough,
he goes back on his decisions.

15:10.367 --> 15:13.329
So was I fired?
I mean, in the end, I'm here. So…

15:13.412 --> 15:15.789
So he's an indecisive hothead.

15:15.873 --> 15:16.874
Wait. What?

15:16.957 --> 15:18.375
Yeah, my dad was crying so hard,

15:18.459 --> 15:21.587
he got all the way home before he realized
he'd left me at my mom's prison.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.589
My parents have an open relationship

15:23.672 --> 15:26.008
because my mom is dating
one of her prison guards.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.678
And I was dating this Russian spy guy
for a while. My dad didn't like that.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.640
Oh, and then, of course,
there are the night terrors.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.101
-Night terrors?
-Yes. My dad has them when he sleeps.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.772
He makes these very weird sounds, like…

15:46.362 --> 15:51.200
I don't know what he's dreaming about,
but, um, it sounds like he's being chased

15:51.283 --> 15:55.496
or he's falling or being killed
or killing somebody.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.790
Honestly kinda sounds
like he's killing Kick,

15:57.873 --> 15:59.500
but I'm not supposed to talk about that.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.753
-He told me not to talk about that.
-Thank you for your time, Ms. Naird.

16:05.089 --> 16:05.923
Yes.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.304
That kid's gonna be so fucked up.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.766
No, they're not foolin' around.
This is a real thing.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.143
<i>-What's the verdict?</i>
-No verdict yet.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.187
Erin is on the stand right now.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.689
God. What…

16:22.356 --> 16:25.985
If this thing doesn't go my way, Maggs,
what's gonna happen to Erin?

16:26.068 --> 16:29.113
<i>You'll be fine.</i>
<i>You always do the right thing, Mark.</i>

16:29.196 --> 16:30.030
Yeah.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.950
<i>You brought me back to prison</i>
<i>after Louise and I escaped.</i>

16:33.033 --> 16:35.452
<i>'Cause you had some intergalactic crisis.</i>

16:35.536 --> 16:36.787
Honey, we talked about this.

16:36.870 --> 16:41.000
I had to take you back to prison
because you can't just escape from prison.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.793
You did the crime.
You have to do the time.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.211
<i>Well, agree to disagree.</i>

16:44.294 --> 16:48.507
Mrs. Naird! Ahoy-hoy.
F. Tony Scarapiducci here.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.510
How are you? Oh, quick question,
if you don't mind. What time is it?

16:51.593 --> 16:53.387
<i>Uh, 2:25.</i>

16:53.470 --> 16:55.305
2:25. And what's trending right now?

16:55.389 --> 16:56.223
-Tony.
<i>-What?</i>

16:56.306 --> 16:58.058
Tony, you don't need to know
what's trending.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.310
-Don't need to know. Just curious.
-It's fine. He's fine.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.937
Maggie, long time no see!

17:02.021 --> 17:03.564
<i>Hi, Brad!</i>

17:03.647 --> 17:04.857
How's prison going?

17:04.940 --> 17:06.525
<i>You know, it's a lot like the military.</i>

17:06.608 --> 17:09.028
<i>-It's structured. You get uniforms.</i>
-Hmm.

17:09.111 --> 17:12.614
<i>And if you put in the time and effort,</i>
<i>you assume a rank.</i>

17:12.698 --> 17:14.908
<i>You can go from being someone's bitch</i>

17:14.992 --> 17:16.452
<i>to a gang member</i>

17:16.535 --> 17:18.370
<i>to a gang member with your own bitch.</i>

17:18.454 --> 17:19.413
Is that Mom?

17:19.496 --> 17:20.622
<i>Is that my baby?</i>

17:20.706 --> 17:22.750
<i>Erin, let me see your face.</i>

17:22.833 --> 17:25.919
<i>Ah! Erin, honey,</i>
<i>everything is gonna be fine.</i>

17:26.920 --> 17:28.047
You don't know that.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.256
<i>You're right. I don't.</i>

17:29.339 --> 17:32.301
<i>But we raised you to be strong.</i>
<i>You're a Naird.</i>

17:32.384 --> 17:36.221
<i>And I can't be there, so I need you</i>
<i>to be strong for your father, okay?</i>

17:37.347 --> 17:39.683
<i>I can't… Now… Did she nod?</i>

17:39.767 --> 17:41.393
-Yeah, sure did.
<i>-Okay.</i>

17:41.477 --> 17:43.812
<i>Mark, you got this. I love you.</i>

17:43.896 --> 17:45.606
-I love you too, Maggs.
-Love you so much.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.024
-Talk to you so soon.
-Bye!

17:56.325 --> 17:57.951
This is depressing.

17:59.369 --> 18:02.831
I think we have to blow off a little steam
while we wait for the verdict.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.667
On your mark, get set, go!

18:05.751 --> 18:08.879
-Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
-Go!

18:08.962 --> 18:09.838
That's it.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.300
-Oh!
-Oh yeah!

18:15.219 --> 18:16.762
-Damn!
-What up?

18:16.845 --> 18:19.098
-What is up?
-All right, fine, fine, fine.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.476
All right. Who's next? Dad?

18:22.559 --> 18:23.477
No, no, no, no.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.686
-Oh, come on!
-Yes, come on.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.105
-No, I'm fine.
-Dad!

18:26.188 --> 18:28.774
What? Oh, he's just scared
he's gonna lose. That's why.

18:31.944 --> 18:32.778
Bring it on.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.368
-Ready?
-Are <i>you</i> ready?

18:39.451 --> 18:42.079
-I was born ready.
-I don't know if you can handle this.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.497
Okay, here we go.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.416
On your marks, set, go!

18:46.500 --> 18:47.876
-Go!
-Go!

18:47.960 --> 18:50.295
-Come on, come on!

18:51.046 --> 18:52.881
Oh!

18:52.965 --> 18:54.091
Ha!

18:54.174 --> 18:56.260
I gotcha. I gotcha.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.553
-Oh!
-I gotcha.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.012
They're ready for you, General.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.973
Oh, okay. Thank you.

19:06.770 --> 19:11.483
From the different documents and testimony
submitted today, General Naird,

19:11.567 --> 19:14.486
it's been suggested that you are unstable,

19:14.570 --> 19:17.281
incompetent, fragile, eccentric,

19:17.364 --> 19:20.951
indecisive, and potentially treasonous.

19:21.034 --> 19:24.830
I can say with some certainty that
I am only two or three of those things.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.373
Most definitely not all six.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.668
Well, you've had
a lot of fingers pointed at you today.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.462
A lot of the blame
has been placed on your shoulders.

19:32.546 --> 19:37.176
So consider this your opportunity
to do some pointing of your own.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.218
Sir,

19:39.261 --> 19:42.681
I learned a long time ago
that when you point a finger,

19:43.307 --> 19:46.018
you have three fingers
pointed back at you.

19:46.602 --> 19:50.314
And your thumb stands erect,
pointed towards the sky.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.484
Yes, I once used one of our satellites

19:54.568 --> 19:57.487
to locate my mother
in a Rite Aid parking lot.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.949
Yes, when I was a child,

20:01.491 --> 20:06.413
I took several pieces of Halloween candy
out of a bowl that said "take one."

20:07.539 --> 20:10.834
Additionally, that Halloween
I was dressed as a hobo,

20:10.918 --> 20:12.920
which I now know is inappropriate.

20:13.545 --> 20:14.880
I am not perfect.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.800
But I do believe that my decision

20:18.884 --> 20:23.180
to protect our astronauts and human life

20:23.263 --> 20:24.640
was the right decision.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.308
Thank you.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.395
General Grabaston,
do you have a final statement?

20:32.022 --> 20:35.442
Naird has always been jealous of me.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.654
From the moment we met,
he's always wanted to be in command.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.281
Well, he had his chance that day,

20:41.907 --> 20:46.036
and I have proven here
that he is treacherous,

20:46.828 --> 20:48.080
undermining,

20:48.622 --> 20:49.915
has small feet,

20:49.998 --> 20:52.251
and is quite possibly a Chinese spy.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.962
That is an outrageous lie.
I am a ten and a half.

20:55.045 --> 20:59.675
Okay, gentlemen, after much deliberation,
we have come to the following verdict.

21:00.634 --> 21:04.096
General Grabaston,
your blatant disregard for human life

21:04.179 --> 21:06.723
would have caused
an international incident.

21:06.807 --> 21:11.853
Therefore, you will retire your position
with full honors and benefits.

21:11.937 --> 21:16.608
Space Force will remain
under the command of General Naird.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.735
Are you fucking kidding me?

21:18.819 --> 21:21.613
Please remove
General Grabaston from the room.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.199
That will not be necessary.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.287
This isn't over, Nerd.

21:33.041 --> 21:36.670
General Naird, until further notice,
you will remain in command of Space Force,

21:36.753 --> 21:39.089
but under the original mission
of the branch.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.215
You can count on me, sir.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.134
-I'm not finished yet.
-All right.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.261
Your Candy Land budget is cut.

21:44.344 --> 21:47.264
Carte blanche to green-light new missions?

21:47.347 --> 21:48.390
Cut.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.184
You will have five months
to prove yourself,

21:51.268 --> 21:54.813
or POTUS will install alternative command.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.816
Consider this a stay of execution.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.484
We can do it in four months, sir.

21:59.568 --> 22:03.447
Talk is cheap, General.
I'll see you in four months.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.950
But if, uh, we fall behind schedule,
does the five-month offer still--

22:07.034 --> 22:09.870
-Dismissed.
-Oh fuck. I always do that.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.541
Ooh.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.839
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

22:20.922 --> 22:21.798
Thank you.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.140
See? You made it.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.017
Yeah, I did, huh?

22:32.517 --> 22:33.602
Told ya.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.021
You're not gonna use it?

22:37.147 --> 22:38.023
No.

22:38.106 --> 22:39.733
Oh… Is the battery dead?

22:40.984 --> 22:42.110
Yeah.

22:48.825 --> 22:50.786
Space Force isn't going anywhere.

22:50.869 --> 22:51.912
-Come on!
-Yes!

22:51.995 --> 22:53.580
-Yes!

22:53.663 --> 22:55.374
-I'm so happy.
-Fantastic.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.917
-Great work.
-Congratulations.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.711
-Congratulations, Mark. Great job.

22:59.795 --> 23:02.964
Talk to you for a sec? Um… Right.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.635
-There's one thing I don't understand.
-What's that?

23:06.718 --> 23:10.222
After all of that,
after all that damning testimony,

23:10.305 --> 23:12.015
how come I didn't end up in jail?

23:12.099 --> 23:13.767
Let alone keep my command.

23:14.351 --> 23:18.939
Mark Naird is a man
of questionable fashion sense

23:19.022 --> 23:21.483
but unquestionable character.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.694
I would go to war for him with anybody

23:24.778 --> 23:25.695
on Twitter.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.448
I would've spent the last few minutes
of my life "Black on the moon"

23:28.532 --> 23:29.825
if it wasn't for Mark Naird.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.786
<i>O Captain, my Captain</i>
<i>Our fearful trip is done</i>

23:32.869 --> 23:36.123
<i>The ship has weather'd every rack</i>
<i>The prize we sought is won</i>

23:36.206 --> 23:39.709
He always thinks of others before himself.
He's a good dad.

23:39.793 --> 23:43.046
Underneath the titanium surface,
he's filled with neon.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.133
Neon is a noble gas.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.343
I'm trying to say
that Naird's a noble dude.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.387
I literally owe my life to him.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.639
<i>The port is near, the bells I hear</i>

23:52.722 --> 23:54.683
He's definitely a great general.

23:55.976 --> 23:56.977
I love him a lot.

23:57.060 --> 24:00.147
<i>For you the flag is flung</i>
<i>For you the bugle trills</i>

24:00.230 --> 24:04.025
There is no better person at Space Force
than Mark Naird.

24:04.109 --> 24:07.487
I… I can't actually
believe I'm saying this,

24:07.571 --> 24:09.531
but he's my best friend.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.701
Maybe you're just lucky.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.619
-I was so worried.

24:14.703 --> 24:15.579
Hmm.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.205
Let's go home, honey.

24:18.290 --> 24:22.461
By the way, it is a sunny 76 degrees
in Tucson, everyone!

24:24.546 --> 24:27.382
<i>Weather looking good</i>
<i>for the whole week, actually!</i>
