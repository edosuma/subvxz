00:06.770 --> 00:09.360
H—Hey, this is…

00:13.990 --> 00:15.410
Master Barrymore!

00:25.030 --> 00:29.250
Lord… Lord… Devil Dog.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.670
Devil Dog?

00:39.590 --> 00:44.360
The small, white-haired dog is a good dog.

00:44.360 --> 00:49.120
The black dog is a bad, disobedient dog.

00:49.120 --> 00:53.860
As the cat meows, the day falls.

00:53.190 --> 00:53.860
What has happened?

00:53.860 --> 00:58.580
As the cat cries, say good night.

00:58.580 --> 01:02.580
If you don’t sleep, the dog will descend.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.580
What are you doing?

01:05.160 --> 01:08.130
It’ll eat you down to the bone.

01:23.930 --> 01:27.090
L—Lord Devil Dog!

01:27.090 --> 01:29.860
Lord Devil Dog, please forgive us!

01:34.470 --> 01:36.050
Miss Angela!

03:09.870 --> 03:14.880
<font size="50">His Butler,</font>

03:10.320 --> 03:14.880
<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">Trai</font></font>

03:10.940 --> 03:14.880
<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">ned.</font></font>

03:17.440 --> 03:19.840
“With that, the case is at an end.”

03:20.170 --> 03:23.920
Having declared such a thing,

03:23.920 --> 03:26.510
this is rather unfortunate, is it not, Young Master?

03:26.820 --> 03:28.180
Shut up.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.140
What about Miss Angela?

03:31.140 --> 03:34.250
We’ve put her to bed for the time being.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.660
It’s no wonder she’s tired out.

03:36.660 --> 03:38.650
It’s so heart wrenching it’s unbearable.

03:40.610 --> 03:47.370
This village completely isolated itself from the rest of society, fearing the curse of the Devil Dog.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.370
The existence of the Devil Dog

03:49.370 --> 03:53.370
was supposed to have been a farce Lord Henry created in order to rule the village.

03:54.460 --> 03:58.050
However, that same Lord Henry has now…

03:58.340 --> 03:59.960
Those bite marks….

03:59.960 --> 04:04.480
Doesn’t it seem as if they really are the Devil Dog’s work, just like the villagers say?

04:04.480 --> 04:08.720
Maybe the Devil Dog was angered by Lord Henry doing all those bad deeds in its name.

04:08.720 --> 04:14.200
Well, it seems certain that this was not the work of humans.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.730
What do you mean by that?

04:24.580 --> 04:26.040
What is troubling you?

04:26.040 --> 04:28.620
Your little revelation earlier.

04:28.620 --> 04:31.230
If it was not the work of a human,

04:31.230 --> 04:35.080
I hope we won’t have another red-haired Reaper coming out of the woodwork.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.710
Even so, I am a butler to die for.

04:39.030 --> 04:43.130
I really am impressed by your capacity for learning.

04:45.730 --> 04:47.720
However, there is no need to worry.

04:48.660 --> 04:52.430
Meirin’s deduction wasn’t all that far off.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.060
The one who was targeted was Lord Henry.

04:56.420 --> 05:00.420
It is unlikely that anyone else will fall victim.

05:00.420 --> 05:03.490
Even so, I cannot leave things like this.

05:03.490 --> 05:06.950
Is this your beautiful loyalty to the Queen?

05:06.950 --> 05:09.860
No. Not just that.

05:09.860 --> 05:12.330
Normally, there wouldn’t be much of interest here,

05:13.160 --> 05:18.210
however, seeing you teased by a dog certainly has some merit.

05:20.870 --> 05:23.130
You really have learned, have you not?

05:29.240 --> 05:32.660
I wonder if Miss Angela is all right.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.300
A—A—A ghost?

05:43.900 --> 05:45.870
M—Meirin?

05:45.870 --> 05:48.300
Finny, did you hear that just now?

05:48.300 --> 05:50.800
Y—Yeah, is that…

05:50.800 --> 05:55.700
The late Lord Henry may have returned…

05:59.640 --> 06:02.160
Meirin?

06:02.160 --> 06:05.350
I have quite a soft spot for scary stories and things like that!

06:05.350 --> 06:07.550
I’m shivering with excitement!

06:09.000 --> 06:10.990
Let’s go, Finny!

06:15.470 --> 06:19.360
Ah, it’s so scary. Too scary!

06:19.360 --> 06:22.110
It is rather.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.920
Ah, that tingles.

06:40.710 --> 06:43.410
Wait. Do it more slowly.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.880
Good boy. That’s a good boy.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.730
Th—The shock was just too much!

06:57.730 --> 07:01.050
Miss Angela really is quite the forceful one.

07:01.050 --> 07:04.690
If the young master saw her like this, what would happen then?

07:04.690 --> 07:08.280
Oh! Afterwards, it would be even more steamy.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.780
Finny?

07:11.880 --> 07:12.740
Finny!

07:17.960 --> 07:19.970
Miss Angela…

07:19.970 --> 07:21.330
Angela…

07:21.690 --> 07:22.750
An…

07:32.870 --> 07:34.890
How fierce.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.190
Morning.

07:48.550 --> 07:50.360
Good morning.

07:51.110 --> 07:53.670
Oh, is it all right for you to be up and about like that?

07:53.670 --> 07:56.070
Yes. I’m sorry to have troubled you so.

07:56.900 --> 08:03.460
Acting like that, even after my master taught me I must never, ever forget my manners around guests…

08:04.540 --> 08:07.840
Oh, Mr. Finny, you look a little pale.

08:08.690 --> 08:12.130
Um, I—I’m not feeling all that well.

08:12.130 --> 08:15.390
Don’t touch me or the germs will spread!

08:15.970 --> 08:17.260
I’m sorry!

08:20.250 --> 08:23.350
It doesn’t look like he’s feeling unwell at all.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.659
Miss Angela…

08:34.659 --> 08:36.280
Finny!

08:38.280 --> 08:43.750
<font size="14"><font color="#f0aa6b" face="Californian FB"><b>Cabinet Pudding.</font></font></b>

08:38.760 --> 08:43.750
Today’s snack is Cabinet Pudding, prepared with blackberries from the surrounding regions.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.730
You’re quite laidback, aren’t you?

08:46.730 --> 08:49.210
There is no need to get flustered.

08:49.210 --> 08:50.750
Sebastian!

08:50.750 --> 08:53.500
What is wrong? You are making a ruckus.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.000
Miss Angela is nowhere to be found!

08:56.000 --> 09:00.500
Ah. It seems there are some herbs that grow near the swamp.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.310
She said she’d go pick them.

09:02.310 --> 09:04.890
On her own? To the swamp?

09:04.890 --> 09:07.810
Really? At a time when the Devil Dog may be running loose?

09:07.810 --> 09:09.570
Ah, damn!

09:09.870 --> 09:12.720
Why did she go to pick herbs at a time like this?

09:13.360 --> 09:16.820
It seems she was worried about how pale you looked.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.080
For me?

09:20.950 --> 09:23.470
Sebastian, we’re going, too.

09:23.470 --> 09:24.160
Oh?

09:24.160 --> 09:29.210
What? Don’t you have any hot, red blood running through your veins?

09:29.210 --> 09:30.570
Let’s go, Meirin!

09:30.570 --> 09:31.630
Yes, sir!

09:31.630 --> 09:32.980
What about Old Tanaka?

09:36.630 --> 09:38.020
He’s got the spirit!

09:38.020 --> 09:39.670
All right! Let’s go, you rabble!

09:39.670 --> 09:41.140
Yessir!

09:52.740 --> 09:57.200
So, what colour <i>is </i> your blood?

09:58.210 --> 10:01.580
Seems like something to get flustered about.

10:06.390 --> 10:10.210
Show them how perfectly you play your role, Sebastian.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.920
Yes, My Lord.

10:28.190 --> 10:30.640
Miss Angela!

10:29.930 --> 10:31.180
Angela!

10:30.640 --> 10:32.410
Miss Angela!

10:31.610 --> 10:33.660
Miss Angela!

10:32.410 --> 10:33.660
Angela!

10:33.660 --> 10:35.650
Miss Angela!

10:37.400 --> 10:39.110
Miss Angela!

10:41.820 --> 10:45.140
Where did Miss Angela go?

10:46.450 --> 10:47.710
What’s wrong?

10:57.810 --> 10:59.760
What on earth is that?

11:00.120 --> 11:03.850
The shocks just keep piling up!

11:08.320 --> 11:11.230
Hey, isn’t that ring…

11:11.230 --> 11:13.020
Lord Henry’s.

11:27.330 --> 11:29.500
Who is that?

11:40.170 --> 11:41.430
That arm…

11:41.430 --> 11:44.570
It really wasn’t the Devil Dog who did Lord Henry in.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.350
It was a human after all.

11:47.730 --> 11:50.810
I—It’s a shocking full-frontal scene!

11:50.810 --> 11:54.270
Did he have a grudge against Lord Henry for some reason?

11:55.330 --> 11:59.780
Maybe Miss Angela asked him to or something!

11:59.780 --> 12:02.450
What? Why would Miss Angela…

12:02.450 --> 12:03.820
That’s right!

12:03.820 --> 12:05.070
Finny!

12:05.070 --> 12:07.280
Miss Angela has nothing to do with this.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.570
You shouldn’t doubt her!

12:28.350 --> 12:30.960
What’s with you lot in that getup?

12:30.960 --> 12:35.810
We were going to perform ablutions in order to quell the Devil Dog’s anger.

12:35.810 --> 12:39.920
Last night, the Devil Dog’s angered voice rang out loudly.

12:39.920 --> 12:43.740
The “Waah” howling lasted all night!

12:43.740 --> 12:45.280
“Waah”?

12:56.270 --> 12:58.340
Hey, wait up, Finny!

12:59.260 --> 13:02.250
All right! Let’s all do our warm-up stretches here!

13:02.250 --> 13:04.720
One, two, three, four…

13:21.830 --> 13:24.530
Th—This noise is…

13:33.660 --> 13:35.870
Hey, that’s…

13:41.240 --> 13:44.510
The Devil Dog!

13:53.970 --> 13:55.310
That’s…

13:56.450 --> 13:58.100
Miss Angela’s…

14:00.700 --> 14:03.480
What’s wrong, Finny? Finny!

14:04.820 --> 14:06.070
Miss Angela!

14:08.670 --> 14:11.370
Damn. Tanaka, hand me that.

14:11.870 --> 14:14.540
I’ll show you my true strength.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.000
Eh?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.750
Why is it a birthday popper?

14:42.630 --> 14:47.320
My, my. You’re quite good at the “Shake hands” command.

14:48.070 --> 14:49.660
Sebastian!

14:51.240 --> 14:54.450
However, as expected,

14:54.800 --> 14:57.200
it is a bit heavy!

14:59.580 --> 15:03.420
Hey, this isn’t the time to be playing around.

15:03.420 --> 15:04.650
Young Master!

15:04.650 --> 15:08.880
Of course. I intend to clean all this up in just a moment.

15:15.640 --> 15:20.390
It is a scent you cannot resist, is it not?

15:20.390 --> 15:24.020
Puppy’s Favourite. They’ll want to eat it every day! It’s Innuko!

15:24.020 --> 15:25.650
Innuko?

15:31.470 --> 15:32.280
Watch out!

15:33.140 --> 15:39.010
The best way to train a dog is to bend its will and strengthen its loyalty.

15:39.010 --> 15:41.720
In other words, the carrot and stick!

15:41.720 --> 15:43.380
First, the carrot!

15:53.280 --> 15:55.240
U—Uh…

15:55.240 --> 15:57.720
Sebastian?

15:58.540 --> 15:59.640
Followed by…

16:02.030 --> 16:02.770
Stick!

16:06.870 --> 16:07.690
Carrot.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.860
Stick!

16:09.860 --> 16:11.110
Carrot!

16:11.110 --> 16:12.360
Stick!

16:12.360 --> 16:13.530
Stick!

16:14.280 --> 16:15.320
Stick!

16:19.860 --> 16:22.580
This is a bigger show than I could have imagined.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.720
And finally,

16:24.720 --> 16:26.180
a big embrace!

16:42.780 --> 16:44.600
Sebastian!

16:49.720 --> 16:51.690
He’s not coming out.

16:54.720 --> 16:58.330
What are you idling around for? Come back here this instant.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.640
Understood.

17:10.470 --> 17:13.700
Uh, is this hot water?

17:17.690 --> 17:19.970
That’s right! What about Sebastian?

17:20.990 --> 17:23.369
One thing is essential for a resort:

17:23.369 --> 17:26.440
a centrepiece that will provide a tourist attraction.

17:28.020 --> 17:30.300
Bathing luxuriously in excessive amounts of hot water,

17:30.300 --> 17:32.240
draining away the fatigue of the day;

17:32.240 --> 17:33.530
that is what this is:

17:34.050 --> 17:35.950
(TL Note) Spa > Hot Spring in UK

17:34.050 --> 17:35.950
the spa!

17:39.950 --> 17:41.880
Sebastian!

17:49.310 --> 17:56.180
If one who serves as a Phantomhive Butler could not strike a spring or two, then where would we be?

17:59.080 --> 18:02.350
Once again, it’s too shocking!

18:03.850 --> 18:04.810
Pluto!

18:04.810 --> 18:06.740
Pluto?

18:13.370 --> 18:15.650
There, there. There, there!

18:21.240 --> 18:25.580
I found this little one about a month ago.

18:25.580 --> 18:31.540
I love dogs, and he was just so cute I ended up trying to tame him.

18:32.230 --> 18:33.500
Cute?

18:34.540 --> 18:39.220
He has a bad habit of turning into a human when he gets excited, though.

18:39.220 --> 18:40.890
Don’t try to settle this by calling it a “habit”!

18:40.890 --> 18:44.190
So, you kept him without telling anyone?

18:44.190 --> 18:45.230
Yes.

18:45.230 --> 18:49.310
Lord Barrymore used the legend of the Devil Dog,

18:49.310 --> 18:53.860
but in reality, he was more afraid of it than anyone else.

18:54.430 --> 18:57.780
When I thought about what would happen if this one found out…

18:58.650 --> 19:01.500
I suppose I was too naïve.

19:01.500 --> 19:05.160
I didn’t think for one moment that he would do that to Lord Barrymore.

19:06.250 --> 19:12.960
I beg of you, is there no way he could be taken to Lord Ciel’s mansion?

19:14.170 --> 19:16.290
Take him to the mansion?

19:16.290 --> 19:21.390
If he’s under Sebastian’s tutelage, I believe Pluto will become a wonderfully obedient dog!

19:21.390 --> 19:25.040
Well, I am one hell of a butler, but…

19:25.040 --> 19:26.560
That sounds fine.

19:29.190 --> 19:31.970
Are you serious, Young Master?

19:31.970 --> 19:35.720
Yes. It sounds fun

19:35.720 --> 19:37.190
in many ways.

19:41.910 --> 19:44.910
The Devil Dog’s curse has been lifted!

19:45.200 --> 19:47.420
Thank you! Thank you!

19:47.420 --> 19:49.800
Hey, what’s all this?

19:49.800 --> 19:51.100
Of course.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.670
There is a legend in this village,

19:53.670 --> 19:57.160
that when the sins against the dogs have been repented,

19:57.160 --> 19:59.630
the earth will let out tears of redemption.

19:59.630 --> 20:03.260
They are blessed tears!

20:05.580 --> 20:09.870
There was already a spring in this village, though.

20:09.870 --> 20:13.190
Well, whatever. Our goal was accomplished.

20:13.780 --> 20:20.130
Would it perhaps be time for you to say that line you so carelessly uttered before?

20:20.130 --> 20:21.400
You do it.

20:22.070 --> 20:25.200
With that, the case is at an end!

20:30.080 --> 20:31.830
This is perfect.

20:31.830 --> 20:35.460
This is the Japanese way of enjoying a spa.

20:35.460 --> 20:39.300
In this way, you can enjoy a small meal as well.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.220
Even so… 

20:51.540 --> 20:54.160
Hey, hold that side.

20:54.650 --> 20:57.650
Would anybody like one?

20:58.190 --> 21:02.610
This gloomy village has undergone quite a transformation.

21:02.610 --> 21:06.490
I’m sure the gloom in Her Majesty’s heart has also been lifted.

21:06.490 --> 21:09.890
It seems my gloom will continue, however.

21:17.290 --> 21:22.030
Don’t forget about me, Pluto!

21:22.760 --> 21:25.500
Pluto! In the meantime, put something on when you go into town!

21:25.500 --> 21:28.310
Plu, you’re jiggling all over the place!

21:25.500 --> 21:28.970
{\an8} <font size="20" face="Arial">Note: This is a pun. “Puru puru” is the sound of jiggling.</font>

21:29.560 --> 21:32.480
Um, Miss Angela…

21:34.320 --> 21:37.900
Let us meet again, Mr. Finny.

21:40.330 --> 21:42.780
Well, then. Shall we make some headway?

21:42.780 --> 21:47.060
I will definitely come to see Pluto sometime.

21:47.060 --> 21:49.880
If possible, I would ask you to refrain from doing so.

21:51.140 --> 21:55.540
Taming a Devil Dog is not such an easy task.

21:55.540 --> 21:59.770
Though you seem to have quite a talent for it…

22:03.280 --> 22:05.360
Let’s go, Sebastian.

22:12.890 --> 22:16.350
See you, Miss Angela!

22:21.630 --> 22:24.270
Surely sometime soon.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.040
Nothing I say comes out right.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.800
I can't love without a fight.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.550
No one ever knows my name.

22:50.550 --> 22:53.260
When I pray for sun, it rains.

22:53.260 --> 22:55.970
I'm so sick of wasting time,

22:55.970 --> 22:58.680
but nothing's moving in my mind.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.430
Inspiration can't be found.

23:01.430 --> 23:03.640
I get up and fall, but...

23:03.640 --> 23:06.440
I'm alive!

23:06.440 --> 23:08.770
I'm alive!

23:08.770 --> 23:09.690
Oh yeah!

23:09.690 --> 23:13.110
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:13.110 --> 23:14.610
reaching for Heaven!

23:14.610 --> 23:17.370
I will fight!

23:17.370 --> 23:19.620
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:19.620 --> 23:22.330
I live my life!

23:22.790 --> 23:25.540
I'm alive!

23:25.540 --> 23:27.880
I'm alive!

23:27.880 --> 23:29.120
Oh yeah!

23:29.120 --> 23:32.260
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:32.260 --> 23:33.800
reaching for Heaven!

23:33.800 --> 23:36.550
I will fight!

23:36.550 --> 23:38.760
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:38.760 --> 23:44.270
I live my hard life!

23:44.270 --> 23:50.770
I live my life! I'm alive!

23:57.660 --> 23:59.870
A Talbot Camera?

24:00.830 --> 24:04.400
Once again, you have obtained quite an exquisite toy.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.210
If it pleases you, I shall take some snaps for you.

24:07.710 --> 24:11.590
Ah, Young Master, please move to the right a little.

24:11.900 --> 24:17.770
Your profile from the left is quite unfortunate.

24:18.550 --> 24:20.220
Next time on Kuroshitsuji:

24:20.220 --> 24:22.300
His Butler, A Phantasm.

24:20.250 --> 24:26.670
<font size="50"><font color="#ffffff">His Butler, A Phantasm</font></font>

24:20.250 --> 24:26.670
<font size="35"><font color="#ffffff">Preview</font></font>

24:22.730 --> 24:25.320
After all, I am one hell of a butler.

24:26.670 --> 24:29.840
<font size="22" face="Californian FB">We shall await you next time…</font>
