WEBVTT

00:10.252 --> 00:14.840
lf someone grabs your parking space,
don't just sit there, say something!

00:15.006 --> 00:20.428
A man with no front teeth and stitches
on his nose can't take criticism.

00:22.055 --> 00:27.435
- What's this?
- One of Daphne's inspirational tapes.

00:27.602 --> 00:29.604
Oh, my God!

00:29.771 --> 00:33.400
"Here, Have a Rainbow",
by Dr Honey Snow.

00:33.566 --> 00:36.194
How can you listen to this drivel?

00:36.361 --> 00:39.406
It's awfully popular drivel.

00:39.572 --> 00:43.952
She tells everyone they're wonderful
and nothing's their fault.

00:44.119 --> 00:46.871
What do you know? They like it.

00:47.038 --> 00:50.250
You should read one of her books.

00:50.416 --> 00:52.252
(Doorbell rings)

00:52.418 --> 00:57.924
I have. After a page, I yearned for the
worldly cynicism of Barney the Dinosaur.

00:59.342 --> 01:01.970
Niles, to what do we owe this pleasure?

01:02.136 --> 01:06.182
- Brace yourself. It's raffle time!
- Not again!

01:06.349 --> 01:11.020
Yes. Ye gods, who's been plumbing
the shallows of Dr Honey Snow?

01:11.187 --> 01:14.607
- I have.
- Insightful, isn't she?

01:16.359 --> 01:21.197
Tickets are only ten dollars
and support Maris' little opera group.

01:21.364 --> 01:25.535
- What's the grand prize?
- Their lead soprano, Mrs Fitzgibbons,

01:25.701 --> 01:29.288
will come and perform
"The Ride of the Valkyries".

01:30.748 --> 01:35.169
We've sold 800 tickets
so the risk is pretty minimal.

01:35.336 --> 01:36.796
All right.

01:36.963 --> 01:42.301
In return, a stock tip: Vectorcomp
Software. Wendell says they can't miss.

01:42.468 --> 01:44.512
- Who's Wendell?
- My broker.

01:44.679 --> 01:48.849
Every stock he puts
me on to pays off. He's clairvoyant.

01:49.016 --> 01:54.188
I've got a bit tucked away. Maybe l
should take a chance with Wendell.

01:54.355 --> 01:58.234
- It's not a sure thing.
- Nothing in life is a sure thing.

01:58.400 --> 02:03.113
Dr Snow has a little saying:
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

02:04.824 --> 02:09.411
She'd better copyright
that before some hack steals it.

02:10.454 --> 02:16.669
I'll go in for 500. That's a lot for me,
but I have a feeling I'm in for some luck.

02:16.835 --> 02:20.923
I'd better get ready.
I'm off to the Book Nook.

02:21.090 --> 02:23.842
Dr Snow's signing copies of her book.

02:24.009 --> 02:26.470
What about my whirlpool therapy?

02:26.637 --> 02:29.681
Oh, right, I forgot.

02:29.848 --> 02:35.437
Would you go there for me, Dr Crane?
It's around the corner from the station.

02:35.646 --> 02:38.899
I would sooner attend a hoedown.

02:40.859 --> 02:45.697
I have my compulsive spending
seminar and I hope to sell these tickets.

02:48.408 --> 02:51.286
- What's the big deal?
- My reputation!

02:51.453 --> 02:53.705
What's the big deal?

02:53.872 --> 02:57.501
OK. lf it makes you happy
to see me humiliate myself.

02:57.668 --> 02:59.711
I always get a kick out of it.

02:59.878 --> 03:01.880
Thanks ever so.

03:03.006 --> 03:08.345
Look, everyone.
Eddie has found his "inner puppy"!

03:10.097 --> 03:11.473
(Eddie barks)

03:17.020 --> 03:21.691
- This will just take a minute.
- I hope so. I've barely got an hour.

03:21.858 --> 03:26.154
Oh, God,
not another Honey Snow book.

03:26.321 --> 03:28.657
"Don't Change, You're Perfect."

03:28.823 --> 03:31.159
People go for this junk?

03:31.326 --> 03:34.412
It's unbelievable.
Get her autograph for me?

03:37.332 --> 03:42.921
Over there. Get it signed then
we'll have lunch at Le Cigare Volant.

03:43.088 --> 03:46.091
- Me? Why don't you do it?
- My reputation!

03:46.257 --> 03:49.177
What's the big deal?

03:49.969 --> 03:52.430
All right.

03:56.059 --> 03:58.102
It's wonderful, isn't it?

03:58.269 --> 04:02.190
I just love what she says about
finding a moment each day

04:02.357 --> 04:06.235
to stop and give yourself a mental hug.

04:06.402 --> 04:09.322
I'm giving myself one now.

04:09.489 --> 04:11.199
Really?

04:11.366 --> 04:14.786
Actually, it's more of
a Heimlich manoeuvre.

04:17.497 --> 04:20.166
- Got it.
- Good. Let's buy it and go!

04:20.333 --> 04:23.086
Not so fast. She wants to meet you.

04:23.252 --> 04:25.338
I don't want to meet the woman!

04:25.505 --> 04:27.548
Do you know what she looks like?

04:27.715 --> 04:31.886
I don't care. The woman stands
for everything I find totally...

04:34.555 --> 04:36.807
...enchanting.

04:36.974 --> 04:39.060
Hello, I'm Dr Honey Snow.

04:39.227 --> 04:44.106
And I'm... Wait, don't tell me...
Dr Frasier Crane!

04:44.273 --> 04:48.861
Dr Crane, let me shake your hand.
Oh, what am I saying - hug!

04:49.028 --> 04:51.697
Why not?

04:52.698 --> 04:56.702
After all, a handshake
is just a hug for fraidy-cats.

04:56.869 --> 04:59.080
No fear here.

05:01.791 --> 05:06.837
- I am one of your biggest fans.
- I've recently become one of yours.

05:07.004 --> 05:12.176
I think the advice you give
is so brilliant, yet so simple.

05:12.343 --> 05:15.888
What about those
mental hugs of yours?

05:16.055 --> 05:18.891
It can't get much simpler than that.

05:19.058 --> 05:21.810
I'll go get started on my appetiser.

05:21.977 --> 05:24.647
Yes, all I want is a little nibble.

05:24.813 --> 05:27.149
Tell me!

05:27.941 --> 05:31.028
I should go, but I'd love to talk more.

05:31.195 --> 05:34.948
There seems to be
such a positive energy between us.

05:35.115 --> 05:40.788
My publisher's giving me a dinner
tonight. Would you come as my guest?

05:40.954 --> 05:43.791
- I'd love to.
- That's great.

05:43.957 --> 05:47.461
- Nice meeting you, Dr Snow.
- Please, it's Honey.

05:50.380 --> 05:53.258
It certainly is.

06:00.182 --> 06:03.560
- Good evening, Dr Crane.
- Good evening, Daphne, Dad.

06:04.728 --> 06:09.441
- Oh, which horse did you wager on?
- Joe's Dream, number eight.

06:09.608 --> 06:14.321
Goodness. He's taking a serene,
almost Buddhist approach to the race.

06:18.992 --> 06:23.997
You should invest in something more
reliable, like Vectorcomp Software.

06:24.164 --> 06:26.374
- Our stock! Did it go up a bit?
- No.

06:26.541 --> 06:30.837
It went up a lot.
It gained 40% overnight.

06:31.004 --> 06:37.052
Wendell advised selling, so, <i>voil√†</i>,
your original 500 plus 200 profit.

06:37.218 --> 06:41.389
200? Dr Crane, I could kiss you!

06:45.352 --> 06:48.730
- That's a nice little dividend.
- I'll say.

06:50.982 --> 06:53.151
What shall I do with it?

06:53.318 --> 06:58.490
You could let Wendell reinvest it,
like I am. It's called rolling it over.

06:58.656 --> 07:02.327
Then I'll do it. This is so exciting.

07:02.494 --> 07:04.245
What's all this?

07:04.412 --> 07:08.625
Your brother just gave me $200,
and now he's going to roll me over.

07:16.132 --> 07:18.801
- Niles?
- Communications breakdown.

07:18.968 --> 07:21.554
Good.

07:21.721 --> 07:25.183
- Why are you dressed up? Hot date?
- Yes.

07:25.349 --> 07:29.228
- With whom?
- Dr Honey Snow.

07:29.395 --> 07:32.523
Did it occur to you
I might not want Niles to know?

07:32.690 --> 07:36.152
Sure it did. Right before I said it.

07:39.155 --> 07:43.284
You're dating Dr Honey Snow?
You consider her a ninny.

07:43.451 --> 07:47.580
What could you possibly see in this...
Ho ho, Mama!

07:49.582 --> 07:54.545
One hell of a cute shrink! No man
wouldn't let her analyse his dreams.

07:54.712 --> 07:58.382
Analyse them? She could star in them.

08:03.179 --> 08:06.849
But what do you say
when she wants to discuss her work?

08:07.016 --> 08:10.102
I just simply...skirt the issue.

08:10.269 --> 08:15.274
"Honey, your books are...
Oh, look, the waiter's on fire."

08:15.441 --> 08:17.818
(Doorbell)

08:17.985 --> 08:21.322
You're jealous. But not half
as jealous as you're about to be.

08:21.488 --> 08:23.949
Get a coaster for your lower lip.

08:25.818 --> 08:28.529
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Honey.

08:28.696 --> 08:32.616
Let me introduce you.
Daphne Moon, Honey Snow.

08:32.783 --> 08:35.870
Honey Snow, Daphne Moon.
She's a big fan.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.164
- Hug.
- Hug.

08:38.330 --> 08:42.668
We both have sort of unusual names:
Daphne Moon, Honey Snow.

08:42.835 --> 08:47.381
lf you married my father,
your name would be Honey Moon!

08:51.677 --> 08:53.721
My father, Martin Crane.

08:53.888 --> 08:57.016
Hello. I see where Frasier
gets his good looks.

08:57.182 --> 08:59.602
Aw, get out of here!

09:01.103 --> 09:06.275
- Last but not least, my brother, Niles.
- Oh, Dr Niles Crane.

09:06.442 --> 09:09.862
I read a wonderful article you wrote:

09:10.029 --> 09:13.282
"Gestalt Therapy -
Probing the Subconscious".

09:13.449 --> 09:19.621
Yes! And I believe I read your quiz in
Cosmo: "Is your guy a stud or a dud?"

09:22.624 --> 09:27.504
- Perhaps we should go.
- Not yet. I want to give you this.

09:27.671 --> 09:30.465
It's a manuscript of my next book.

09:30.632 --> 09:33.010
Another one? So soon?

09:34.136 --> 09:38.599
I hope you like it because
I'd love for you to write the foreword.

09:38.765 --> 09:41.685
- Me?
- Who better?

09:44.604 --> 09:48.275
Actually, there's so many other people

09:48.442 --> 09:51.611
more qualified to write
for such an important work.

09:51.778 --> 09:54.698
I almost think you don't want to do it.

09:54.865 --> 09:57.159
Oh, no, it's a great honour.

09:57.325 --> 10:01.580
I'll say. The last book had
an introduction by Mickey Rooney.

10:04.541 --> 10:07.878
Then I'm writing that foreword!

10:08.044 --> 10:10.297
That's great!

10:10.463 --> 10:15.260
By next fall there'll be 500,000
copies with your name on the cover.

10:15.427 --> 10:17.721
I've got my Christmas shopping done.

10:23.852 --> 10:27.731
(Giggling)

10:29.274 --> 10:33.319
- Stop giggling. It's distracting.
- Have you read this?

10:33.486 --> 10:37.740
I'm trying to recommend the book.
Reading it doesn't help.

10:39.534 --> 10:41.911
OK, here. How's this?

10:42.078 --> 10:45.415
"Volumes have been
written about human behaviour,

10:45.582 --> 10:48.751
"and I can say,
without fear of contradiction,

10:48.918 --> 10:53.756
"that this book can stand on the shelf
next to any of them."

10:58.845 --> 11:01.222
- No good, is it?
- No, but this is.

11:01.389 --> 11:05.518
"You don't have to be a star to twinkle."

11:07.645 --> 11:09.856
Frasier, I need a hug.

11:10.682 --> 11:13.518
Niles, will you please help me?

11:14.102 --> 11:18.189
Honey asked me to write this
and she's got a deadline.

11:18.356 --> 11:21.609
"Time is a concept known only to man.

11:21.776 --> 11:23.987
"Just for today, be a sunflower."

11:24.153 --> 11:26.197
Give me that!

11:28.533 --> 11:30.952
You don't know what's at stake.

11:31.119 --> 11:35.456
I've never felt this way
about a woman. I'm out of control.

11:35.623 --> 11:42.088
Her effect on me is... There's no words
to describe it. It's more like a sound.

11:42.255 --> 11:45.383
(Growls)

11:47.176 --> 11:49.470
Talking about Honey again?

11:49.637 --> 11:51.514
Yes.

11:51.681 --> 11:56.602
It's laughable to put your name
on 500,000 copies of this piffle.

11:57.311 --> 11:59.814
Not even piffle. It's piffle-lite.

12:01.565 --> 12:03.943
Lay off your brother.

12:04.110 --> 12:06.779
Some women make guys
do stupid things.

12:07.488 --> 12:12.743
When I was on traffic duty there was
a redhead who got away with anything.

12:12.910 --> 12:16.956
She could be doing 90,
a school crossing guard on her hood,

12:17.123 --> 12:20.292
she'd flash that pouty smile

12:20.459 --> 12:25.297
and I'd ignore my partner, wag my
finger at her and send her on her way.

12:25.464 --> 12:30.094
Yes, it's the old
"good cop, horny cop" routine.

12:33.180 --> 12:36.850
Good, you're all here.
I want to show off my new coat.

12:37.017 --> 12:41.981
- Very nice.
- I've spent like a drunken yuppie.

12:43.691 --> 12:46.568
I went a bit over my budget.

12:46.735 --> 12:51.115
lf you're concerned about cash flow,
Wendell called today.

12:51.281 --> 12:53.492
Again? Four times in two weeks?

12:53.659 --> 12:57.204
The man's a wizard.
Daphne, your profit.

12:58.831 --> 13:00.874
$400!

13:01.041 --> 13:04.127
Dr Crane!

13:04.294 --> 13:07.130
And here's one for Wendell.

13:07.297 --> 13:10.092
Did I mention
Wendell has a secretary?

13:11.385 --> 13:13.512
This calls for a celebration.

13:13.679 --> 13:16.932
I'll take you all out for a nice dinner.

13:17.099 --> 13:19.685
I'll just put on my new dress.

13:19.851 --> 13:23.605
Put on your new shirt
and corduroy slacks.

13:23.772 --> 13:28.026
lf you're buying I'm gonna
wear elastic-waist pants and no belt.

13:31.571 --> 13:35.784
Well, Niles, that broker of yours,
he's a marvel.

13:35.951 --> 13:39.079
Yes, he's doing
wonderful things for me.

13:40.288 --> 13:42.541
I'd say so. I've been so impressed

13:42.707 --> 13:47.379
that I asked Daphne about it
and invested a few hundred.

13:47.546 --> 13:50.590
Really? Well, congratulations.

13:50.757 --> 13:54.886
Thank you but there's one thing
that's hard to figure out.

13:55.053 --> 13:59.557
Although I invested in
the very same stock that Daphne did,

13:59.724 --> 14:02.769
mine declined and hers went up.

14:04.688 --> 14:09.359
- How do you explain that?
- Obviously one of us is lying.

14:12.028 --> 14:14.072
What are you up to?

14:14.239 --> 14:18.076
This whole stock thing
was a lie from the start.

14:18.243 --> 14:23.706
No, first it paid off, but then it tanked.
What was I supposed to do?

14:23.873 --> 14:27.669
Tell that working-class Venus
I'd lost her life savings?

14:27.835 --> 14:31.422
I paid her back with a bit extra.
Where's the harm in that?

14:31.589 --> 14:37.136
Paying a woman for physical affection
is the oldest profession.

14:37.303 --> 14:40.223
Granted, it's the Walt Disney version.

14:40.390 --> 14:44.018
But it's wrong. I insist you stop it.

14:44.185 --> 14:48.356
No, it's altruistic, noble and fun
and you can't make me stop.

14:49.482 --> 14:54.695
Dr Crane, take this $400 back
and buy whatever Wendell says.

14:54.862 --> 14:57.615
Consider it done.

14:57.782 --> 15:01.244
I should get on that gravy train myself.

15:03.955 --> 15:06.073
I'm in for 10,000.

15:06.074 --> 15:09.369
Good lord. $10,000, Dr Crane?

15:09.535 --> 15:14.248
Think of the dinner I'll be able to buy
when Niles brings me my profits.

15:14.415 --> 15:19.962
Hell, put me down for 200!
This guy's some kind of genie.

15:20.129 --> 15:22.173
He's a real treasure, isn't he?

15:22.340 --> 15:27.804
I only hope those chest pains
he complained about are indigestion.

15:29.138 --> 15:33.601
Shall we go? I've decided on Farmer
Jack's Chicken, Chicken, Chicken.

15:33.768 --> 15:36.771
I hear the chicken there is very good.

15:36.938 --> 15:40.149
- Are you coming?
- You run along. I'll take my car.

15:42.777 --> 15:46.197
Well, I hope you're happy!

15:47.239 --> 15:49.825
Snap out of it! You're dishonest.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.411
- Said the pot to the kettle.
- What?

15:52.578 --> 15:55.331
- You know what it means.
- Don't be ridiculous.

15:55.498 --> 15:58.375
- Our situations are different.
- How so?

15:58.542 --> 16:02.588
- You're selfishly misleading a woman.
- So are you!

16:02.755 --> 16:06.133
- She also...trusts you.
- And the difference is?

16:06.300 --> 16:08.969
Your woman is English.

16:11.430 --> 16:15.517
- Frasier, you've lost this one.
- I know.

16:15.684 --> 16:18.062
It'll just take a little while...

16:18.228 --> 16:21.774
to climb down
off this particular high horse.

16:27.321 --> 16:30.949
- I think you know what you have to do.
- Yes.

16:33.243 --> 16:37.080
I have to tell her
I can't write the foreword.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.251
And I have to say goodbye

16:41.418 --> 16:45.255
to the chance of ever
sleeping with absolute perfection.

16:47.925 --> 16:50.177
Where, oh where...

16:50.344 --> 16:52.721
will I have the chance again...

16:53.722 --> 16:58.060
to gaze upon such
extraordinarily proud...

16:58.226 --> 17:00.604
and supple breasts?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.774
Not to worry, brother.

17:03.940 --> 17:07.986
That's the special at Farmer Jack's
Chicken, Chicken, Chicken.

17:16.243 --> 17:21.082
- Thanks for the wonderful dinner.
- Thank you for the fabulous table.

17:21.249 --> 17:24.294
Hugging the ma√Ætre d' really clinched it.

17:24.461 --> 17:28.173
- Would you care for a nightcap?
- Sure.

17:28.339 --> 17:32.552
You seemed tense all evening,
but I have just the thing.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.555
It's a sandalwood candle.

17:35.722 --> 17:39.726
The scent is guaranteed
to calm you down.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.523
You better fire up about ten of those.

17:52.906 --> 17:58.703
I'd really like to talk to you about that
foreword I've been trying to write.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.914
Can we not talk about work?

18:01.080 --> 18:07.045
All day I've been researching an article
on sexual intimacy.

18:07.211 --> 18:11.799
I'm up to here with "The Joy of Sex"
"Kamasutra", Masters and Johnson...

18:11.966 --> 18:14.010
Really?

18:14.177 --> 18:18.514
I feel like I've been
reading recipes all day,

18:18.681 --> 18:22.393
only there are no groceries
in the house.

18:22.560 --> 18:26.272
Well, your bagboy has arrived.

18:32.695 --> 18:35.907
I really need to discuss this now.

18:36.073 --> 18:39.035
You're such a workaholic.

18:39.202 --> 18:42.705
I only hope you're this tireless
about everything.

18:44.415 --> 18:47.627
Oh, you won't have any complaints.

18:48.878 --> 18:52.048
I've got to focus
on the subject at hand.

18:52.214 --> 18:55.634
Frasier, tonight,
I am the subject at hand.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.894
No, no, Honey, I can't do it!

19:05.060 --> 19:08.772
That's all right.
I have a candle for that, too.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.568
No, I can't write the foreword.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.904
Why not?

19:15.070 --> 19:20.034
Well, I...
I didn't think it was a very good book.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.288
I think the world of you
and wish you success

19:24.455 --> 19:29.126
but the book isn't good enough
to put my name on it.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.629
I guess I'll be going now.

19:34.089 --> 19:37.342
I am so attracted to you right now.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.892
Most men will say anything
to a woman to have sex.

19:45.058 --> 19:49.897
How great to meet a man who would
risk rejection rather than be dishonest.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.274
Well, I...

19:55.277 --> 19:58.405
have to be true to my inner voice.

20:01.491 --> 20:06.204
I thought the book was weak myself.
I rushed it to meet a deadline.

20:06.371 --> 20:11.793
I'm so glad you respected me
enough to be honest.

20:11.960 --> 20:16.381
I think honesty is
the greatest aphrodisiac of all.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.301
I hope you feel you can be
as honest with me.

20:19.468 --> 20:24.598
I do. Tell me everything.
I don't want us to hide anything.

20:24.764 --> 20:30.270
Your chapter titles were
clumsy and <i>jejune</i>. Your turn.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.815
You use too much French
in everyday conversation.

20:33.982 --> 20:37.027
I think that sandalwood stinks.

20:41.364 --> 20:45.201
When you talk about wine,
I wish I had a gun.

20:46.703 --> 20:50.623
I thought your first three books
were trite and saccharine.

20:51.624 --> 20:54.043
It's your turn, Honey.

20:56.921 --> 20:59.257
Honey?

21:02.218 --> 21:05.763
I'm immensely proud
of my first three books.

21:05.930 --> 21:08.141
As well you should be.

21:08.308 --> 21:13.271
- You thought they were trite.
- I meant trite in its best sense.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.274
As in the phrase, "trite and true".

21:20.903 --> 21:25.783
- What about saccharine?
- I love it. Use it every day.

21:25.950 --> 21:29.120
I'm glad you like saccharine, darling.

21:29.287 --> 21:33.124
Because there's no way
you're getting any Honey.

21:37.670 --> 21:39.964
Good night, Frasier.

21:43.342 --> 21:45.386
Honey, I...

21:46.137 --> 21:48.681
I'm sorry. I really am.

21:49.724 --> 21:53.728
Couldn't we try one of
your forgiveness exercises?

21:54.562 --> 21:58.065
- Good night, Frasier.
- Hug?

21:59.317 --> 22:03.487
A poet once said something about
the world that applies to us:

22:03.654 --> 22:08.075
"It ends not with a bang,
but with a whimper."

22:15.166 --> 22:20.880
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:21.046 --> 22:22.423
# Quite stylish!

22:22.590 --> 22:29.471
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:29.638 --> 22:35.436
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:35.602 --> 22:38.105
# They're calling again #

22:38.272 --> 22:41.066
Good night!

22:42.305 --> 22:48.838
