September 4, 1980
palermo, Saint rosalia's day

02:11.131 --> 02:14.043
cosa nostra bosses meet
at Stefano bontade's villa.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.508
Palermo is the world capital of heroin.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.670
The old palermo mafia
and the new corleone clan

02:19.890 --> 02:22.552
meet to divvy up the heroin trade,

02:22.768 --> 02:24.679
thus avoiding another mafia war.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.499
The fugitive tommaso buscetta,"boss
of two worlds", is also present.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.188
As a simple "soldier", he can not
participate in the meeting,

02:38.450 --> 02:40.970
but he has influence with bontade,
head of the palermo alliance.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.030
Buscetta attends
with his third wife Christina

02:46.208 --> 02:48.164
and children from his previous marriages.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.588
Where are you going? Papal!

04:13.670 --> 04:15.877
- Papa...
- C'mon, get up!

04:17.798 --> 04:19.005
Get up!

04:19.426 --> 04:22.132
- Papa, why are you hitting me?
- Benedetto, let's go.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.920
Papa, I love you.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.643
God is love.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.307
Gimme a hug, papa.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.408
A toast to our friends.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.163
And to our families.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.201
And to money!

04:56.046 --> 04:57.707
Cheers!

05:04.846 --> 05:06.928
Here, take your brother!

05:19.986 --> 05:21.851
Come, let's dance
to something lively!

05:21.988 --> 05:24.479
Let's dance! Music, maestro!

05:36.378 --> 05:37.709
What's wrong?

05:44.135 --> 05:46.342
Your wife's good, isn't she?

05:46.847 --> 05:50.135
She raised all these kids
without having kids and stepkids.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.014
Masino, will you tell me
what's wrong?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.262
Do you see benedetto?

05:58.024 --> 05:59.889
He looks done in.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.102
Yeah, done in...

06:05.740 --> 06:08.152
- How did it end up?
- All good.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.171
Why don't you have them come with us?

06:31.308 --> 06:34.175
They don't want to,
this is their life.

06:34.436 --> 06:38.645
- You have to force them.
- They're not kids anymore.

06:38.815 --> 06:42.774
Antonio's made me a grandfather.
Stop talking nonsense.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.309
You don't want them.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.189
Yeah, I don't want them in Brazil.
They're lost.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.990
A photo!

07:41.127 --> 07:42.742
A nice photo!

07:43.964 --> 07:45.704
This will be fun!

07:50.637 --> 07:53.720
- Hide that gun.
- Why, can you see it?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.761
Masino, come here!

07:57.477 --> 07:59.092
Toto, you come here too.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.469
Everyone's gotta be in it.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.639
The kids too, here.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.859
For this beautiful family and for
this peace that must never end.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.242
Peace?

08:16.538 --> 08:17.778
A farse...

08:25.422 --> 08:26.912
Be careful.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.414
The first to start, never loses.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.573
Long live Saint rosalia!

09:15.346 --> 09:19.089
The infirm want your grace.

09:19.184 --> 09:22.051
Long live Saint rosalia!

09:22.479 --> 09:25.937
Step by step we'll bring you.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.564
Long live Saint rosalia!

09:28.735 --> 09:31.351
In every street on every road.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.609
Long live Saint rosalia!

09:35.617 --> 09:38.984
He who does not say it with me
is not a devotee.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.862
Long live Saint rosalia!

09:42.373 --> 09:46.457
Thunder and storms and we call you.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.624
I'm leaving.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.585
When?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.713
Why are you leaving now?

10:00.141 --> 10:03.850
Things are getting better,
can't you see all the money circulating?

10:04.020 --> 10:06.477
You can't take money
to the grave with you.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.105
You have to look after
benedetto and Antonio.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.015
You know they're like sons to me.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.174
The traitor

10:53.069 --> 10:56.937
December 1980,
Rio de Janeiro, grumari beach

10:59.450 --> 11:01.441
be careful, it's dangerous!

11:15.216 --> 11:17.457
The water's dangerous.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.053
You're freezing.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.964
I couldn't get out of the water.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.436
Remember, father, your church
spread all over the earth,

13:01.698 --> 13:05.282
make it perfect in love and in the
union with our pope John Paul...

13:24.095 --> 13:27.212
Stefano, I baptize you
in the name of the father,

13:27.307 --> 13:30.094
the son and the holy spirit.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.684
Thank you.

13:41.112 --> 13:43.103
Long live Stefano!

13:48.494 --> 13:50.450
We have a problem with the stopover.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.617
When the undersecretary realized
it was for planes

13:53.875 --> 13:56.366
arriving from Peru,
Bolivia and Colombia...

13:58.087 --> 14:00.248
Two plus two equals four.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.255
- How much did he ask you for?
- One and a half.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.007
Let's make it two... three.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.755
All right.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.758
I'd like to go live there
with all my family.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.011
In amazonia?

14:16.898 --> 14:19.605
- You want to be a hermit?
- Let's go.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.396
Your excellency.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.896
Mr felici!
What a lovely family you have!

14:26.991 --> 14:28.902
Thank you very much. Madam.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.534
Yes, the truth is I'm happy here
with my family, my father-in-law...

14:34.791 --> 14:36.372
We're among friends

14:37.293 --> 14:40.501
and when you're among friends
you can get around any problem.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.379
Gentlemen, please.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.167
Hold it.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.510
One more.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.011
What's he doing here?

15:04.821 --> 15:06.402
Here we go...

15:16.707 --> 15:18.197
Don't be afraid, pippo.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.330
Stay down!

15:58.583 --> 16:00.494
You gotta be quiet.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.507
Out!

16:13.639 --> 16:17.097
- It was out!
- Masino, it was in!

16:17.351 --> 16:19.592
No, it was out.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.142
Mr felici, a personal call for you.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.141
It's over.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.647
Drinks for everyone, on me.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.112
That was a goal!

16:35.912 --> 16:37.027
Hello?

16:37.413 --> 16:38.744
How are you?

16:41.167 --> 16:42.282
Who's this?

16:42.668 --> 16:44.283
Don't you recognize me?

16:44.795 --> 16:46.626
A friend, masino.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.504
How are you?

16:49.300 --> 16:51.165
The family all good?

17:30.216 --> 17:33.549
- What'd you say at your pa's funeral?
- What did I say?

17:35.096 --> 17:37.462
You said you want to avenge him.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.172
Yeah, it's true.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.432
Whoever killed him's gonna
meet the same end!

17:43.604 --> 17:45.686
Have you ever fired a gun?

17:46.357 --> 17:47.357
Yes.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.603
With the right or with the left?

17:51.237 --> 17:52.977
I don't understand.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.880
Everything okay?

18:26.022 --> 18:27.387
Everything good?

18:27.773 --> 18:29.513
All quiet, sir.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.417
Papa!

19:18.324 --> 19:19.689
Sit down.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.909
When a brother dies
it's like losing an arm.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.582
Be strong, masino.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.553
Totuccio was saved by a miracle

19:50.606 --> 19:55.350
and now he wants to slaughter
the corleonesi with his bare hands.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.977
But what can he do alone?

19:58.739 --> 20:01.230
He hasn't got this.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.192
But you've got this.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.992
Tano, what do you want?

20:17.717 --> 20:20.254
All the heroin in the world
passes through palermo,

20:20.344 --> 20:22.881
there's billions for everyone.

20:23.264 --> 20:28.099
And the corleonesi are wiping out
half the world, women, kids...

20:29.729 --> 20:31.344
You know what scarpuzzedda did?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.980
To Toto inzerillo's son?

20:35.276 --> 20:39.144
First he cut off his arm,
then he killed him.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.396
What need was there?

20:43.159 --> 20:44.774
You're not even safe here.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.027
Stefano wanted to stop riina,

20:48.122 --> 20:51.364
he spoke to the commission about it,
he wanted to shoot him.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.034
Why didn't they do it?

20:55.296 --> 20:59.005
They would have, but riina is smart
and he didn't go to the meeting.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.416
Who's still on our side?

21:03.554 --> 21:05.670
We're losing many
of them along the way,

21:05.806 --> 21:09.014
they've gone over
to those louts of riina's.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.015
But we're not dead yet,

21:11.061 --> 21:14.053
we're not dead, we can still make it.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.900
But you gotta come back.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.312
You get me?

21:25.326 --> 21:28.159
The salvos told me too,
ignazio asked me.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.448
Besides, we're not alone in Rome,

21:34.585 --> 21:36.701
there's still our friends.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.329
- What does pippo say?
- Mr calo?

21:42.218 --> 21:46.086
He's in Rome, he says
he's working for his career.

21:49.475 --> 21:53.434
I'm not scared of dying,
I'm not scared of anything,

21:54.355 --> 21:56.937
but to go there and tell them:

21:58.359 --> 22:00.350
"Here I am, kill me"... why?

22:01.987 --> 22:03.102
For glory?

22:04.240 --> 22:06.982
Like the kamikazes?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.235
Am I a jerk?

22:12.498 --> 22:16.366
We gotta kill them,
before they kill us.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.995
We need to think it through, tano.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.541
- Hello?
- It's me.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.044
Can you hear me?

23:11.432 --> 23:13.297
I can't hear you very well.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.052
- Benedetto and Antonio...
- Are you crying?

23:19.648 --> 23:23.266
- Benedetto and Antonio are gone.
- Put my wife on.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.438
Hello? Masino, I'm here.

23:31.452 --> 23:34.535
What's going on?
Did you call Cal?

23:34.955 --> 23:37.196
Of course, but he never answers.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.578
Masino, you gotta
come here immediately.

23:41.587 --> 23:46.081
They're our sons, your sons!
They've gone, don't you see?

23:46.216 --> 23:48.207
What do you mean
he never answers?

23:50.179 --> 23:51.965
You gotta come here!

23:52.056 --> 23:53.592
I'll take care of it now.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.589
I'll take care of it now!

25:44.209 --> 25:46.325
Why aren't you in bed?

25:46.837 --> 25:48.702
I was waiting for you.

25:57.598 --> 25:59.463
What's going on?

26:02.936 --> 26:04.426
Nothing.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.600
Nothing.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.584
Stay here!

26:37.513 --> 26:39.253
Stay calm.

26:40.516 --> 26:43.633
I'm putting it down, stay calm.

26:56.657 --> 26:58.397
Stay calm.

27:11.672 --> 27:15.915
Mr tommaso "busketta”
we have a warrant for your arrest

27:16.009 --> 27:18.500
and to search your house.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.921
- His name is Roberto felici.
- Start with his office.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.924
Then the bedrooms,
I want to find the drugs.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.304
There are no drugs here.

27:28.689 --> 27:30.554
So where's the money, then?

27:30.941 --> 27:33.148
If you collaborate
things will be much easier.

27:33.694 --> 27:36.436
Here's his passport,
his name's Roberto felici.

27:36.572 --> 27:39.063
You're in the wrong house.
For the love of god...

27:39.158 --> 27:41.194
Enough! Shut up!

27:42.786 --> 27:44.151
Shut up!

27:47.583 --> 27:49.323
- Mr "busketta"...
- Buscetta.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.831
My name is tommaso buscetta,
you need to say it properly.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.420
Cuff him.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.955
Let's start the search.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.343
Please.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.622
Who did you traffic heroin with? Speak!

28:55.859 --> 28:58.145
Who's your contact?

28:59.029 --> 29:01.145
Speak, you filthy trafficker!

29:59.548 --> 30:05.339
July 7, 1984 Rio de Janeiro,
talavera Bruce prison

30:28.952 --> 30:30.943
Italy's beautiful, isn't it?

30:31.997 --> 30:33.112
Yes.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.745
But I'm not going there on vacation.

30:38.587 --> 30:39.997
I know all of Italy,

30:40.130 --> 30:43.998
or rather all the prisons of Italy.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.380
Want a cigarette?

30:50.974 --> 30:52.259
Thanks.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.480
How far to the airport?

31:10.243 --> 31:13.656
First we have to stop by the hospital
to get you checked out,

31:13.747 --> 31:18.241
the government wants to ensure
they send you to Italy in good health.

31:19.503 --> 31:22.666
They want to show that
you have been treated well in Brazil.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.543
What's happening to him?

31:29.638 --> 31:31.674
Hold his head!

31:33.266 --> 31:35.678
Go faster!

31:35.769 --> 31:37.805
Faster to the hospital.

31:38.563 --> 31:44.058
- Did he poison himself?
- He's having convulsions! Go faster!

31:47.948 --> 31:52.942
Go faster, before he dies on us here.

32:22.858 --> 32:24.348
Darling.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.735
You're safe.

32:48.467 --> 32:53.131
July 14, 1984
Rio de Janeiro, extradition to Italy

33:37.807 --> 33:39.547
You all right?

35:28.293 --> 35:29.533
Doctor?

35:32.172 --> 35:33.878
What's wrong?

35:38.928 --> 35:40.168
Breathe.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.545
Breathe, come on.

35:55.445 --> 35:56.901
That's it.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.404
Breathe, slowly.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.087
- De gennaro?
- Yes?

36:22.097 --> 36:25.589
- Where are you taking me?
- Judge Falcone will explain it to you.

36:26.476 --> 36:28.967
- I'm not talking to anyone.
- All right.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.804
Rest now, just relax.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.723
You're not eating?

37:10.979 --> 37:12.515
I'm not hungry, thank you.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.370
No, it's not necessary.

37:46.681 --> 37:49.172
July 15, 1984
Rome, fiumicino airport

37:49.559 --> 37:52.301
tommaso buscetta, 56,
known as Don masino

37:52.395 --> 37:57.059
has returned to his homeland in
handcuffs, hidden under a blanket.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.686
A week ago,
the head of the sicilian mafia

37:59.819 --> 38:02.777
tried to kill himself in Brazil
with strychnine,

38:02.947 --> 38:05.529
but it didn't help him
avoid extradition.

38:06.409 --> 38:10.197
His presence had become awkward
for the Brazilian authorities.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.404
In south America, Don masino

38:12.582 --> 38:15.699
had created a fortune
starting in the '60s.

38:16.461 --> 38:20.170
He was first been extradited
from Brazil in 1972,

38:20.215 --> 38:23.082
incarcerated first
at the ucciardone, then in turin,

38:23.176 --> 38:26.088
following a conviction
for drug trafficking,

38:26.179 --> 38:30.843
buscetta managed to escape
from turin in 1980,

38:30.975 --> 38:33.557
where he had obtained semi-Liberty

38:33.603 --> 38:35.594
and took refuge in Brazil.

38:36.064 --> 38:38.976
Linked to the badalamentis
and other families

38:39.108 --> 38:41.064
of the so-called
"failing" palermo mafia...

38:41.361 --> 38:46.481
July 16, 1984 Rome,
San vitale police headquarters

38:49.077 --> 38:50.567
wait here.

39:05.635 --> 39:08.627
I'd like you to meet mr pajno,
the prosecutor of palermo,

39:08.721 --> 39:11.212
and judge Giovanni Falcone.

39:13.142 --> 39:16.009
I wanted to reassure you personally

39:16.396 --> 39:20.639
that your family has full protection
in the United States.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.642
Also, at the judiciary committee

39:25.029 --> 39:28.146
a law is being considered,
also in Italy, to offer

39:28.408 --> 39:32.993
material guarantees and personal
safety to state informants.

39:33.288 --> 39:34.903
I am not an informant.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.909
Yes, of course.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.658
You're free to make
all the statements you want.

39:41.129 --> 39:44.417
I only wanted to inform you
that the state is not inert.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.045
Good, then I'll leave you
to judge Falcone.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.297
All the best with it.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.555
So, first name and last name.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.938
Buscetta tommaso.

40:12.577 --> 40:15.193
The late benedetto
and the late bauccio Felicia,

40:16.289 --> 40:19.326
born in palermo July 13, 1928,

40:20.168 --> 40:23.080
elementary school, no military service,

40:23.713 --> 40:26.580
married with children,
agricultural businessman.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.917
- Previously convicted.
- It's the law...

40:31.095 --> 40:32.210
Yes, yes.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.310
Good. Shall we start?

40:43.191 --> 40:45.102
I'm not an informant.

40:46.361 --> 40:47.942
Changed your mind?

40:48.738 --> 40:51.980
I confess I'm surprised, I thought
you wanted to collaborate,

40:52.116 --> 40:53.731
that's why we came here.

40:54.994 --> 40:58.111
I'm not a spy, a rat...

41:00.083 --> 41:02.699
I have been a man of honor
and I'm ready

41:02.752 --> 41:04.834
to pay my debt with the law.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.250
Now then...

41:13.596 --> 41:16.588
There's one question
I will not answer.

41:17.475 --> 41:20.262
Actually, I'll answer it
before you ask me.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.265
I have never trafficked drugs.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.854
It's pointless asking me.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.776
How much do you smoke?

41:38.413 --> 41:39.528
- None left?
- No.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.280
Take mine.

41:49.257 --> 41:50.667
Right...

41:52.301 --> 41:54.917
Shall we start with your affiliation?

41:56.639 --> 41:58.800
To give the questioning an order.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.646
I'm tired.

42:12.447 --> 42:13.562
Good.

42:17.410 --> 42:20.402
Read and sign here.

42:26.586 --> 42:29.544
- The packet.
- Keep it, I have another one.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.631
- Good day, then.
- And to you.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.879
- If you need anything, send for me.
- Thank you.

43:24.977 --> 43:28.265
- Never leave him by himself.
- Do I leave the door open?

43:33.736 --> 43:36.478
Would you like me to turn on the TV?

43:37.406 --> 43:39.738
That's not necessary, thank you.

43:40.535 --> 43:43.902
- Have any preference for lunch?
- I'm not hungry.

43:46.290 --> 43:49.157
- Something light.
- All right.

44:47.727 --> 44:49.092
Mama.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.226
What's happening?

45:01.991 --> 45:05.233
Masino, what have you done?

45:07.872 --> 45:09.487
How could you leave me?

45:09.624 --> 45:12.991
My husband, what have you done?

45:13.586 --> 45:16.202
You left me with these kids...

45:17.506 --> 45:20.248
Masino, my husband.

45:20.885 --> 45:24.753
What a weight I feel in my chest!

45:34.357 --> 45:37.269
Our pillar is leaving us...

45:54.168 --> 45:56.784
My son, come with me.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.788
Come with me.

46:00.549 --> 46:04.041
My beautiful boy...

46:18.693 --> 46:20.183
What's going on?

46:21.445 --> 46:23.902
Judge Falcone will do
the next interrogation in here.

46:25.032 --> 46:26.397
Why?

46:26.826 --> 46:29.283
Mr de gennaro ordered it
for your safety.

46:37.420 --> 46:40.036
There's a phone call for you
from your wife.

46:53.602 --> 46:55.217
Turn them on, please.

46:56.480 --> 46:57.811
Thank you.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.442
- Cristina?
- Darling.

47:03.946 --> 47:06.813
- Sweetheart, are you all right?
- Yes.

47:06.866 --> 47:09.858
- The kids?
- They're safe, they're well.

47:09.952 --> 47:12.864
Everyone's asleep, they're tired.

47:14.248 --> 47:16.990
And you? How are you feeling?

47:17.585 --> 47:20.247
I'm fine... I'm fine.

47:21.213 --> 47:23.374
Where have they put you?

47:24.258 --> 47:27.625
In a house for the time being,
I have everything I need.

47:27.762 --> 47:31.380
Tomorrow they're moving us
somewhere else, I hope it's permanent.

47:31.515 --> 47:33.380
That's all I can say.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.262
What have you decided?

47:39.899 --> 47:42.515
Masino, think of the kids,

47:44.153 --> 47:48.522
they're asking about you,
they want to see you again.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.356
Sodol.

47:57.917 --> 47:59.532
You have to talk.

48:06.759 --> 48:08.624
What's that noise?

48:27.530 --> 48:29.316
What are you wearing?

48:30.408 --> 48:32.273
I'm not wearing anything.

48:48.300 --> 48:51.337
Let's start with the question
I asked you last Wednesday,

48:51.804 --> 48:54.841
the first and only one: Your affiliation.

48:55.933 --> 48:59.346
- When did you enter the mafia?
- The mafia doesn't exist.

48:59.603 --> 49:02.970
The mafia is an invention of the press.

49:03.607 --> 49:06.314
"Cosa nostra", we call it.

49:07.445 --> 49:09.606
That's what we men of honor call it.

49:10.865 --> 49:13.982
You have to imagine a pyramid,

49:14.952 --> 49:17.944
on the base of which
there are soldiers.

49:18.247 --> 49:21.239
I'm a soldier, a simple soldier.

49:22.126 --> 49:26.620
The soldier swears an oath
of absolute loyalty to cosa nostra

49:26.881 --> 49:30.465
and for his whole life
he cannot leave cosa nostra.

49:31.260 --> 49:32.716
Three families form a mandamento,

49:32.761 --> 49:37.004
each with a capomandamento, a boss.

49:37.099 --> 49:41.138
At the apex of this pyramid
there's the commission,

49:41.228 --> 49:42.889
with the head of the commission

49:42.980 --> 49:46.393
who is elected by the soldiers
of all the families.

49:48.777 --> 49:51.393
I swore loyalty to cosa nostra,

49:53.532 --> 49:57.150
the old one, over forty years ago.

49:57.411 --> 49:58.651
I was a kid.

50:01.624 --> 50:05.242
Last time I accepted your cigarettes
because the packet was open.

50:06.795 --> 50:09.912
A carton, a new packet,
I'd never have accepted.

50:11.425 --> 50:16.135
This organization
that's so well structured...

50:18.432 --> 50:20.923
- What was your rank?
- Simple soldier.

50:22.186 --> 50:25.553
With all your prestige, your authority,

50:25.648 --> 50:27.058
a simple soldier, why?

50:29.527 --> 50:31.063
You're a natural leader.

50:32.821 --> 50:34.436
My character.

50:35.824 --> 50:38.566
I've never been interested
in commanding,

50:39.328 --> 50:42.946
I wanted to be free to travel,
to play, to have fun.

50:43.958 --> 50:45.698
I've always liked women.

50:49.797 --> 50:53.210
Riina used to say:
"Better to command than to fuck."

50:53.342 --> 50:55.082
For me it's the opposite.

50:57.179 --> 50:59.545
And riina's never been able
to stand that.

50:59.598 --> 51:02.681
He's obsessed with power,
much more than with money,

51:03.310 --> 51:05.221
which he doesn't enjoy at all.

51:08.190 --> 51:10.351
I'd left, I'd got out of the way,

51:11.694 --> 51:13.480
but that wasn't enough for riina.

51:13.821 --> 51:16.437
He slaughtered
half my family, my sons...

51:17.950 --> 51:21.113
To force me to come back
so he could kill me too.

51:24.456 --> 51:26.242
He's a sick soul.

51:44.768 --> 51:47.225
I'd like to tell you a story.

51:48.522 --> 51:50.513
I was very young,

51:50.733 --> 51:52.849
I was around sixteen,

51:54.361 --> 51:55.601
newly affiliated.

51:55.654 --> 51:59.146
My capo orders me to kill a person.

52:02.661 --> 52:06.153
It was the day this person's son
was getting baptized

52:06.415 --> 52:08.781
and I waited outside the church.

52:11.420 --> 52:15.288
When he sees me,
because he knew me by sight,

52:15.507 --> 52:17.919
he realizes
he's been condemned to death

52:18.177 --> 52:20.543
and I was supposed to kill him.

52:21.180 --> 52:26.049
He immediately tears his son away
from his mother and hugs him tight.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.426
I couldn't shoot,

52:29.688 --> 52:31.804
I couldn't frighten the baby.

52:32.191 --> 52:36.434
From that day on, he always
left home accompanied by his son.

52:36.695 --> 52:39.812
They were inseparable,
he took him to kindergarten,

52:39.907 --> 52:44.571
to elementary school, to middle
school, up until high school.

52:56.465 --> 52:58.672
Then the son got married.

53:09.561 --> 53:12.803
In those days you didn't touch kids.

53:13.857 --> 53:17.315
Women, judges...
Cosa nostra had values,

53:17.361 --> 53:20.444
principles shared by everyone...

53:20.489 --> 53:22.070
What values?

53:23.367 --> 53:24.982
To protect poor people.

53:25.828 --> 53:28.865
I knew a capo, gaetano filippone,

53:28.956 --> 53:32.949
he traveled by tram, died penniless.

53:33.335 --> 53:35.826
- But do you really believe in it?
- In what?

53:36.213 --> 53:38.078
You don't honor your intelligence,

53:38.132 --> 53:41.750
killing carabinieri and judges,
ruining kids with heroin...

53:41.969 --> 53:44.881
I'm talking about before heroin,
there's a difference.

53:45.013 --> 53:46.344
And in fact, I left.

53:46.390 --> 53:49.723
Sure, before heroin
men of honor didn't kill people...

53:50.018 --> 53:52.225
There are countless stories
of atrocious crimes,

53:52.271 --> 53:54.887
the old and noble mafia
is a myth, enough!

53:56.108 --> 53:58.645
There's something else
I have to say to you.

54:00.154 --> 54:02.770
You're known
as the boss of two worlds,

54:02.906 --> 54:04.988
how did you earn that title?

54:05.033 --> 54:07.866
You've never pleaded guilty
to a serious crime,

54:07.911 --> 54:10.994
if you admitted to something
you'd be more credible.

54:11.665 --> 54:15.123
Before you said you didn't like
to shoot, but rather to watch.

54:15.419 --> 54:17.535
Don't jerk me around, buscetta!

54:19.047 --> 54:21.288
Judge Falcone, we made a deal.

54:24.178 --> 54:26.009
I'm respecting it.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.016
You can sign.

54:36.565 --> 54:38.556
Now you'll become a celebrity,

54:39.568 --> 54:41.559
but they'll try to destroy you.

54:43.280 --> 54:47.023
Professionally and physically.

54:48.076 --> 54:50.067
You can die for so many reasons,

54:51.705 --> 54:54.822
a car accident,
a plane exploding in flight,

54:55.584 --> 54:56.915
cancer...

54:58.587 --> 55:00.327
Death is always with us,

55:02.216 --> 55:04.081
we die and that's it.

55:05.969 --> 55:08.210
I only want to die in my bed.

55:10.599 --> 55:12.965
That would do me, it'd be a fine victory.

56:00.399 --> 56:02.606
They put us in together.

56:04.111 --> 56:06.147
High season,

56:06.530 --> 56:08.395
all booked out.

56:13.871 --> 56:16.283
- Are you done?
- Thanks, Michele.

56:20.294 --> 56:21.659
Good night.

56:23.922 --> 56:25.412
Good night.

56:42.941 --> 56:45.148
What's this judge Falcone like?

56:46.320 --> 56:47.935
I don't trust anyone.

56:51.450 --> 56:54.408
How many of your relatives
has riina killed?

56:55.329 --> 56:58.571
Riina and his scumbag friends
killed two cousins of mine,

56:59.333 --> 57:01.699
a few of my wife's relatives,

57:01.919 --> 57:04.831
honest people
who weren't even in cosa nostra.

57:05.088 --> 57:09.047
Then they killed the doctor who
patched me up when they shot me,

57:09.593 --> 57:11.584
those mad dogs really let him have it.

57:12.179 --> 57:14.340
We let them take too much space.

57:15.599 --> 57:17.965
Yes, but now riina, his whole family,

57:18.977 --> 57:22.845
his descendants, his friends...
We'll kill them one by one.

57:25.108 --> 57:27.474
For my troubled mind and my pain,

57:27.611 --> 57:29.727
I'd like to kill them with myself.

57:31.615 --> 57:34.231
Pippo calo too, sly and cuckold.

57:34.826 --> 57:37.863
Let's do judge Falcone a favor
and get rid of all this garbage,

57:39.081 --> 57:41.322
let's make him happy, too.

57:42.376 --> 57:46.210
Totuccio, cosa nostra is over,
now you just have to talk.

57:52.511 --> 57:54.251
Good night.

58:34.302 --> 58:36.884
Remember when
we were in ucciardone?

58:37.806 --> 58:41.765
We ate lobster,
there was champagne and caviar...

58:42.769 --> 58:46.011
Here they brought us
zucchini, rice and carrots.

58:47.941 --> 58:50.307
What kind of jail is this, masino?

58:50.944 --> 58:52.559
And all the pussy that came in?

58:52.821 --> 58:55.153
What sensational fucks we had...

58:56.199 --> 58:58.440
What grand sluts they were.

59:06.460 --> 59:08.325
How old are you?

59:09.588 --> 59:11.294
Still young.

59:14.217 --> 59:17.835
Winter 1974
palermo, ucciardone prison

59:18.055 --> 59:20.717
get out, buscetta's gotta fuck.

59:21.224 --> 59:22.839
Get out, move.

59:22.976 --> 59:25.718
- Get out, he's gotta fuck.
- C'mon, get out.

59:26.229 --> 59:27.969
Get out!

59:38.825 --> 59:40.816
Get undressed.

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:37.497
Scarpuzzedda...

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.671
Giuseppe greco,
known as scarpuzzedda.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:44.546
Killer of Stefano bontade,
of Salvatore inzerillo.

01:00:45.267 --> 01:00:47.804
Tano badalamenti told me in Brazil

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:52.684
that before he killed
inzerillo's son, he cut off his arm.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.560
Come in.

01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:58.025
Thank you, put it here.

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:13.700
I read in your eyes
you thought it might be poisoned.

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:18.459
I did, it's true.

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:21.208
But for me or for you?

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.341
Thank you.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.678
We've drunk so many, why now?

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:36.349
No, no, precisely
because we're winding up.

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:43.821
Do you really think
that what you've written

01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:46.733
is still secret?

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:51.489
Men of honor are not only in sicily,

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:57.835
only, they've learned
how to knot their ties.

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:01.123
Give me names,
accusing the state means nothing.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:04.751
There are no untouchables for me.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:07.758
I'm more afraid of the state
than the mafia.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:11.262
So, you want names from me?
You don't know them?

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.478
You read those names
every day in the papers.

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:20.858
You're a judge, you know that
to accuse someone you need proof.

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:23.110
The proof will come.

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:26.523
No one imagined that you'd collaborate,
yet you're doing it.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.032
Judge Falcone,
we only have to decide one thing,

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:35.035
who has to die first, you or me?

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:40.666
Let's continue.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:45.546
- With this.
- That's bagarella leoluca.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:48.921
He personally killed Boris giuliano.

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:52.678
That's the pope, Michele greco,

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.677
the head of the commission, that is...

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:58.772
Because riina moves him
like a puppeteer.

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:04.812
Buscetta talks
mafia commission revealed

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:08.065
by a boss on his knees
blow to the mafia

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.137
judge Falcone convinces
tommaso buscetta to talk

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:12.072
attack to the heart of the mafia

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:13.695
bosses brought to their knees

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.948
the darkest day

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.203
truth about 120 crimes

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:20.456
366 arrest warrants

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:22.708
buscetta's confessions
historical blow to crime

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.924
blitz will go down in history

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.426
its over

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:45.068
Pietro! Pietro!

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:47.688
Help!

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:50.983
Dec. 7, 1984, Pietro busetta,
buscetta's brother-in-law

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:04.374
Here I am.

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:07.082
- Mrs buscetta...
- Don't call me buscetta anymore.

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:10.002
I renounce that name
and I renounce tommaso buscetta!

01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:13.756
Don't call him my brother, anymore,
I don't want to hear that name.

01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:17.635
He destroyed my family's peace,
he made our life hell!

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:22.014
We've been living in fear since
that man started talking.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:26.109
They killed my husband
because of my last name!

01:04:26.154 --> 01:04:28.395
Just because of my last name!

01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:31.864
At home we've stopped living.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:35.494
I don't want
to be called buscetta anymore!

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:39.406
And if he is a real man
he should kill himself.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:43.034
He should hang himself
like Judas iscariot!

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:46.166
Ma'am, do you believe
in Christian forgiveness?

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:49.132
Yes, but first he has to kill himself

01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:51.418
and then I'll forgive him.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:04.066
Who is it?

01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:07.684
Throw some stuff in a bag
and come down. Hurry!

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.902
Calo, don't be afraid, it's
the police. You're under arrest.

01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:20.948
You're making a mistake,
my name's Mario agliadoro.

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:27.083

The defendant

01:05:57.704 --> 01:06:00.195
The defendant ennio...

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:02.455
The defendant has sewn
his mouth shut.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.990
Who?

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:06.622
Salvatore ercolano
sewed his mouth shut.

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:08.369
Mr president!

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.376
Can you speak into the intercom?

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:14.630
Go on.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:17.758
Salvatore ercolano,
my companion in misfortune,

01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:20.591
asked me to read this message.

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:23.851
"My only defense is my mouth,

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:28.732
but no one believes this mouth,
so I sewed it shut."

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:32.644
How did he get a needle and thread?

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:35.776
What have you done?
You have to speak to us!

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:37.615
You can't do things on your own.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:41.778
With this gesture, mr president,

01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:46.913
my client intends to protest against
the system of so-called "penitents”,

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:49.878
who unjustly accuse him.

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:51.413
Very well, counselor.

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.915
Can we proceed with the roll call?

01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:56.668
Faia Salvatore, present...

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:08.684
Help! Help!

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:19.817
Sinagra Vincenzo is throwing a fi,

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:22.903
shouting unintelligibly.

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:29.076
Let's resume the roll call.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:30.952
Greco Michele, at large.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.083
Mom, help me!

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:35.335
Again? I don't believe it!

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:40.087
Hey, check me out!

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:45.092
- It's a madhouse in here.
- A lunatic show.

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:49.220
Get a load of my dick!

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:54.692
We need a resident psychiatrist.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.487
- Mr president?
- Speak into the intercom.

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:11.493
Excuse me, I'm suffering
from a certain nervousness

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:15.706
due to the fact that since
this morning I have eyes on me,

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:18.374
in front of me and behind.

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:21.631
These guards here staring at me...

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:24.510
I've got nothing against them,

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:29.640
but I need to look you
judges in the eye.

01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:33.394
I need to look,
because looking is important,

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:37.644
a gaze can beat you up,
it can even kill.

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:42.524
As Michel butor said: "The gaze
is the expression of reality."

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.403
I need to look into the eyes
of those I'm being judged by.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:49.656
These are standard
security measures, mr leggio.

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:52.033
But what's standard security?

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:56.880
Making the prisoner nervous?
Preventing him from listening?

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.796
Teresa, blood of my blood!

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:08.258
My husband is not a traitor!

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.680
They didn't sell out!

01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:26.533
What do you say?

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:30.572
Do you want to see it
by the light of day?

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:33.040
If I could, thank you.

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:59.059
- What do you think?
- Can I see something else?

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:00.977
Certainly, why not?

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:09.577
- I'd like to try that one on.
- Very good.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.116
Is that andreottl?

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.712
Yes, it's andreotti.

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.625
Here you are.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:29.134
What kind of function is it for?

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:33.889
A wedding? For a daytime function
gray is also attractive.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:38.765
The president is leaving.

01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:40.766
Goodbye, president.

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:42.769
Goodbye.

01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:46.606
Goodbye, president.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:11:01.163
April 2, 1986 palermo

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.939
Buscetta snitchand traitor

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:28.193
buscetta filth

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.532
What do we do?

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:41.081
Nothing, let them pass.

01:11:45.092 --> 01:11:48.835
Long live the mafia
that gives us work

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:34.009
Buscetta, we've put you in here.

01:12:34.392 --> 01:12:37.225
You'll be able
to follow the trial on television.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.227
You have my number,
call me whenever you want.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:44.141
You're being watched 24 hours a day,
you'll never be alone.

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:47.269
A favor, may I see the courtroom?

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.399
Of course, follow me.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:59.910
- Where does calo sit?
- In cell number 16.

01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:07.667
Very well.

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:22.182
April 1963
palermo, calo and buscetta

01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:04.725
April 3, 1986
buscetta's first deposition

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:08.603
the smoking ban applies to everyone,
I can't make exceptions

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:13.571
and we can't step in every time
to apply the ban.

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:18.360
I'm asking for permission
to smoke a cigar, not cigarettes,

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:22.993
for therapeutic reasons
and not for pleasure.

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:27.372
Due to abuse in my youth,
my breathing is compromised,

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:31.464
the doctor said if I don't smoke,
I'll hyperventilate.

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:34.091
I mean, I have to smoke.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:38.880
I believe you, but you'll need
to bring me a medical certificate

01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:41.883
and I'll authorize it immediately.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.726
Let us proceed.

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:47.889
I believe counselor costa
wishes to speak.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:51.522
Yes, mr president,
I wish to communicate to you,

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:54.103
that the defendant
tommaso buscetta,

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:57.774
who had declined to appear,
is at the disposal of the court.

01:14:58.119 --> 01:15:00.610
Good, then let's interrogate him.

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:06.657
Silence, it's just a first interrogation,

01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:08.538
there will be others.

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:10.494
Bring in the defendant.

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:22.257
Mr buscetta! Mr buscettal!

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:28.270
Don masino!

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:33.935
You can't take pictures
of the defendant with a flash,

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.066
or call out his name.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.970
So, buscetta,

01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:11.814
you...

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.980
During the investigative phase,

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:20.441
gave many interviews
for a total of 487 pages.

01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:24.694
Yes and I confirm it all.

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:30.117
I was and remain a man of honor.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:34.704
I entered cosa nostra
with a certain spirit

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:37.999
and inside me that spirit
hasn't changed.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:43.634
They are the ones who have betrayed
the ideals of cosa nostra.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.632
This is why, mr president,

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:49.511
I do not consider myself an informer.

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:58.774
Mr president, I ask to be interrogated.

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:02.614
- Speak into the intercom.
- I don't need it.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:07.032
They can hear me anyway.
Besides, I have to look at you directly.

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:10.748
And since mr buscetta
has told a bunch of lies,

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:13.876
for example,
he says he doesn't know me,

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:16.537
but I state that he knows me.

01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:21.046
I demand an opportunity
to ask this gentleman questions.

01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:26.172
Very well, you may ask questions
during cross-examination.

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:28.049
Let the record reflect that.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:30.135
Mr president!

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:33.896
I too, tommaso spadaro,
ask to be interrogated.

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:38.275
I can prove that buscetta is a liar.

01:17:38.946 --> 01:17:41.437
Very well, you may also
be cross-examined.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:44.031
- I have certain documents...
- Very well.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:46.567
Mr president!

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.571
It's me. Excuse me, huh.

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:52.577
My name is giuseppe bono

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:57.169
and I want to look
that rat buscetta in the eye!

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.331
Mr president!

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:05.552
I'd like to be cross-examined
with mr buscetta too.

01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:08.840
Very well, let the record reflect that...

01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:12.093
Spadaro tommaso, bono giuseppe

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:15.062
and also add calo giuseppe.

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:16.563
Is there anybody else?

01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:18.190
I long for

01:18:18.235 --> 01:18:22.103
this cross-examination, mr president.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:27.984
April 10, 1986 - cross-examination
between calo and buscetta

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:41.126
Traitor!

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:54.352
Buscetta, you're a ball-less loser!

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.640
Cuckold!

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:06.276
Mr president, we can't see buscetta
and it's important we see his face.

01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:08.278
It's called "face to face".

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.150
No and no!

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:14.121
The lawyers may not see either
the defendants or the witness.

01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:18.409
This is something you learn
in the first year at university.

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:20.870
Then, I have a different penal code,

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:25.007
I have never read that a lawyer may
not look the defendant in the face.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:28.503
You will do without,
security reasons dictate it.

01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:31.672
But, mr president,
buscetta is a defendant,

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:34.679
he is not padre pio of pietrelcina.

01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:38.930
This glass booth places us
in a position of inferiority.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:41.808
They want to convict us all.

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:45.269
Right, because in Rome
there's some big shot

01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:50.032
who's making deals
to keep us in here.

01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:52.318
That's the truth!

01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:02.953
Enough!

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:05.706
Enough!

01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:10.461
Gentlemen, enough!

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:14.591
Those defendants who
do not observe religious silence

01:20:14.685 --> 01:20:17.472
will be ejected from the court.

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:22.473
Well, let us begin.

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.100
Listen, calo,

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:30.107
why did you ask to be cross-examined
with tommaso buscetta?

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:33.863
What are your objections?
You've read the transcripts?

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:36.328
Yes, I've read them.

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:42.119
And it's all false, starting with
the fact that we know each other.

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:46.964
I knew his brother well, not him.

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:51.377
We were friends, we've known
each other since we were kids.

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:55.511
I got him into cosa nostra.

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:59.890
Then he became the boss
of our mandamento, porta nuova,

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:04.519
before crossing over to the corleonesi.

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:08.019
It's not true
I was friend of his brother,

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.521
who was very fond of me.

01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:12.773
The one who's alive
or the one you killed?

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:16.027
Buscetta, I'll ask the questions.

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:19.405
Really... may I continue?

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:22.287
- Please.
- Speak!

01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:24.785
I was talking about
this brother, Vincenzo.

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:29.165
I spent a year and a half

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:31.170
with this brother in the same cell.

01:21:31.303 --> 01:21:33.134
One day, mr president,

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:35.671
practically with tears in his eyes,

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:39.517
he said: "Look what masino did to me.

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:43.895
He's gone again and he's left me
with one son in prison

01:21:43.941 --> 01:21:49.277
and the other one a junkie,
he destroyed them."

01:21:49.696 --> 01:21:52.312
I'm telling you this
to make you understand

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:56.151
what mr masino buscetta
is capable of.

01:21:56.954 --> 01:22:00.663
Buscetta, do you wish to reply?

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:04.453
I'm angry with...

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:07.453
- Angry?
- With him...

01:22:08.215 --> 01:22:13.209
Because in 487 pages
of interrogation,

01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:18.343
I never touched
on anybody's family problems.

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:21.175
And I never will

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:25.225
family, for me, is sacred.

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:27.931
Even yours.

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:33.814
Calo, you dispute that you
and buscetta know each other.

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:36.315
Of course, I'm just meeting him now,

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:38.359
now that he's famous,

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:42.488
but he and I have never been friends.

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.615
We've never been friends?

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.871
Never, I don't know you.

01:22:48.589 --> 01:22:52.081
Mr president, may I show the court proof

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:55.752
which may be helpful
in demonstrating the truth?

01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:58.219
Please proceed.

01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:03.763
Marshal, if you would... thank you.

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:21.152
That's me, not my brother.

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:25.489
Together, no?

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:28.124
Hugging.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:30.536
See, see.

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:33.289
The hand on my shoulder is his.

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:36.546
Can you see it?

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.295
Please, let the record reflect that.

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:43.299
Mr president, I entrust myself
to your intelligence,

01:23:43.393 --> 01:23:45.304
and the intelligence of the court.

01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:49.180
According to this gentleman
I must be friends

01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:52.641
with all the people I meet
either at weddings

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:54.275
or baptisms

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:57.646
and I'm supposed
to remember all these people?

01:23:57.699 --> 01:24:01.317
Don't you remember?

01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:04.699
I gave my blood for your son
when he needed it.

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:09.325
I gave my blood,
you lying scoundrel!

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:13.954
- You'd sell out your own mother.
- You're a liar!

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:17.337
Enough, please!

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:20.589
Please, enough!

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:22.671
There... there...

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:28.344
- Mafioso consent, there it is.
- You're a liar.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.186
Enough!

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:33.308
You're the liar
and you're also a swindler.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.102
You've swindled all of Italy.

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:39.985
For that you deserve a kiss
and a medal, but only for that.

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:41.861
The medal yes, the kiss, no,

01:24:41.994 --> 01:24:45.737
because I remind you that you kissed
my sons and let them be killed.

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:47.492
How dare you accuse me?

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:51.451
Why didn't you have me killed too?

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:53.748
- Buscetta...
- Don't call me buscetta.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.622
- Call me something else.
- My dear buscetta...

01:24:56.717 --> 01:24:59.379
Don't call me buscetta.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:02.469
God is great, my dear buscetta.

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:06.006
- God is great and I believe in him.
- Don't say "dear".

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:07.591
I believe in miracles.

01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:10.386
Now I'm well guarded,
you'll have to wait to shoot me.

01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:13.355
- You'll have to wait a few years.
- All right, we'll wait.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.265
- Good.
- I'll wait.

01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:19.395
Finally, for once
you've been Sincere.

01:25:20.407 --> 01:25:24.025
If we're resorting to threats,
we will suspend this cross.

01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:27.236
You call these threats?

01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:31.872
I'll tell you something new.

01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:34.414
Unknown.

01:25:35.005 --> 01:25:37.542
Filthy rat spy.

01:25:37.924 --> 01:25:42.167
It's not in the statements,
I just remembered now, mr president.

01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:46.005
- Are you willing to hear it?
- Go on.

01:25:46.433 --> 01:25:48.173
- The latest arrival.
- What?

01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:53.020
Unlike you,
my memory still helps me.

01:25:53.774 --> 01:25:56.060
In 1979, I am in prison,

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:59.814
I open the newspaper
and read: "Missing..."

01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:10.070
A person,

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:13.790
a member of his family
because I no longer belong to it.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:17.457
As soon as
I run into mr calo I ask him:

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:21.040
"What did giannuzzo do
to be disappeared?"

01:26:21.218 --> 01:26:23.459
Remember what you said?

01:26:25.972 --> 01:26:28.429
"The commission told me to."

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:32.302
"Yes, but did you tell the commission
that he was a good boy,

01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:36.222
that he'd suffered hunger, prison,
that he had no one?"

01:26:36.483 --> 01:26:39.225
"The commission told me to,
I had to do it."

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:42.819
Giannuzzo lallicata

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:46.823
was your protege,
you killed him with your own hands.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:49.701
A man of our family,
but instead of protecting him,

01:26:49.746 --> 01:26:51.987
of asking what he was guilty of...

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:53.743
What are you talking about?

01:26:53.834 --> 01:26:58.999
Instead of asking
what he had done to be snuffed out...

01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:01.087
I mean, really...

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:05.092
These things you're pulling out...

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:08.470
- Are they things they tell you to say?
- What?

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:10.130
- Who?
- I don't know.

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:12.887
You just keep insisting with lies.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.229
Yes, now the judges
will decide if these are lies.

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:21.767
Because otherwise
you can't take the prize, am I right?

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:23.769
You can't take the prize.

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:27.113
The fact is
you don't want to go away defeated.

01:27:27.534 --> 01:27:30.276
I am defeated,

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:33.032
I'm incarcerated like you,
I've lost everything.

01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:37.241
I've lost my family, my friends,
my freedom, I've lost it all.

01:27:37.627 --> 01:27:41.290
That's your business,
you know what you've done.

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:43.163
Hypocrite.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:45.666
You ought to recite "mea culpa”,
you know the facts.

01:27:45.802 --> 01:27:47.417
Hypocrite.

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:49.924
Mr president, he knows perfectly well

01:27:50.056 --> 01:27:53.548
how much I respected
his brother and his sons.

01:27:53.894 --> 01:27:55.430
Hypocrite.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.684
When he says these things,
it really hurts me.

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:04.185
He knows perfectly well
that when his brother died,

01:28:04.321 --> 01:28:08.030
I was sorrier about it
than him, he was...

01:28:08.074 --> 01:28:09.939
He was in Brazil!

01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:12.032
Leading the high life,

01:28:12.078 --> 01:28:16.538
- partying and taking it easy.
- Hypocrite.

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:19.040
Only after that he turned informer!

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:23.454
- Hypocrite.
- And why don't you turn informer too?

01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:25.789
Say things.

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:28.424
All right.

01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:32.713
I'd say that we can end
this cross-examination right here.

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:35.971
Escort calo back to his cell.

01:28:36.728 --> 01:28:38.468
I wish you a good day.

01:28:42.818 --> 01:28:45.059
We can proceed

01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:47.944
with the next cross-examination.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.446
Spadaro.

01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:56.365
My client declines
the cross-examination.

01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:58.238
Bono?

01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:03.202
My client declines
the cross-examination.

01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:05.462
Leggio?

01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:07.247
He declines the cross-examination.

01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:13.880
Does anyone else wish
to cross-examine tommaso buscetta?

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:23.268
Let's go smoke, mr president.

01:29:26.528 --> 01:29:30.020
April 11, 1986
Salvatore contorno's deposition

01:29:37.414 --> 01:29:38.654
Please, enough!

01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:41.873
Silence!

01:29:47.674 --> 01:29:49.289
Silence!

01:30:02.272 --> 01:30:04.058
Silence!

01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:06.398
Silence!

01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:15.899
Contorno, you spoke
about drug trafficking,

01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:21.451
about how everyone got rich
and became millionaires.

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:26.292
As long as we had cigarette smuggling
it all worked fine,

01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:30.209
then when heroine came in
they lost their minds over the money,

01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:32.799
they always wanted more.

01:30:33.303 --> 01:30:36.340
But now all the kids are dying,
even their sons.

01:30:36.556 --> 01:30:39.298
They've been bereaved by drugs, too.

01:30:40.226 --> 01:30:43.844
- Didn't your son die from aids?
- Silence! Will you let us continue?

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:47.226
Wasn't the other one
shot to death? Shut up!

01:30:47.609 --> 01:30:49.691
Wasn't your son shot to death?

01:30:50.236 --> 01:30:52.943
He was the son of that guy
who shot me at brancaccio,

01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:56.982
who had a sister, who also died from
heroine, it was in all the papers.

01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.985
They're losing everything,

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:02.863
their kids, their blood,
but they go on like sheep,

01:31:02.999 --> 01:31:04.990
like they taught me in school...

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:08.618
I had a teacher who made me
understand, then she retired...

01:31:08.755 --> 01:31:11.997
And the sheep fall into the ravine
one after another.

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:15.000
Mr riina takes a step to the side

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:18.344
and the sheep all end up
in the ravine, none are spared.

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:20.756
President, we need an interpreter here.

01:31:20.892 --> 01:31:24.885
My colleagues from the mainland
haven't understood a word.

01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:27.972
Contorno, enough,
stop speaking like that.

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:31.482
Look, they can't understand you.
Speak proper Italian.

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:34.769
It's habit, if I don't talk fast
I lose my train of thought.

01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:38.777
- Sorry.
- Eh, sorry...

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:42.118
What was I saying? I don't remember.

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:44.154
You were talking about drugs...

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:45.780
Exactly.

01:31:46.042 --> 01:31:48.658
If you follow what I'm saying...

01:31:49.379 --> 01:31:51.745
With drugs the earnings are enormous,

01:31:52.382 --> 01:31:54.498
and they've all gone off the rails.

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:57.547
Cosa nostra isn't "our thing" anymore,
now it's "my thing".

01:31:57.929 --> 01:32:00.545
They even kill newborn babies.

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:03.176
And you call these men of honor?

01:32:03.309 --> 01:32:05.049
You're a scoundrel!

01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:09.638
The scoundrel is you,
mr Luciano liggio!

01:32:15.947 --> 01:32:17.778
Cuckold! Snitch!

01:32:17.824 --> 01:32:21.066
Who are you calling a snitch”?
You bastard cuckold!

01:32:21.828 --> 01:32:24.535
How can you allow that?

01:32:26.082 --> 01:32:30.075
Contorno, you need to look at me
and not make gestures!

01:32:30.587 --> 01:32:33.169
If they call me a cuckold,
I insult them.

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:35.956
No, you mustn't make gestures
at the cages!

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:38.087
But I'm not a cuckold.

01:32:38.178 --> 01:32:41.215
You're the president?
Then be the president.

01:32:41.306 --> 01:32:42.716
What are you talking about?

01:32:42.849 --> 01:32:46.341
If they insult me, I insult them,
or else I'll get up and go!

01:32:46.978 --> 01:32:50.061
- Contorno, please.
- What are we going to do here?

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.725
Sit down.

01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:54.850
May we resume, please?

01:32:55.737 --> 01:33:00.106
You were talking about earnings
from drug trafficking.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.485
Exactly.

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:05.827
The money from drugs,
kidnapping, etc.,

01:33:05.872 --> 01:33:09.364
mr pippo calo handled it all.

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:16.079
He and riina are like
the cat and the fox in Pinocchio.

01:33:16.508 --> 01:33:19.875
Then, after they shot me,
I left palermo.

01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:22.757
You're referring
to the attack against you

01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:25.884
on June 25, 1981.

01:33:26.226 --> 01:33:27.841
I don't remember the exact day,

01:33:27.894 --> 01:33:30.510
I don't want to remember
such a horrible day.

01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:34.643
We cannot go on like this,
we are in a court of law.

01:33:34.734 --> 01:33:37.851
- Contorno has to speak in Italian!
- He's incomprehensible.

01:33:37.904 --> 01:33:40.145
Italian... Italian.

01:33:41.366 --> 01:33:43.903
I've always spoken sicilian dialect,
mr president,

01:33:43.993 --> 01:33:47.235
I don't know how to speak Italian,
so it's sicilian or nothing.

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:50.030
If some Italian comes to me,
I'll speak Italian,

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:53.162
if sicilian comes to me, I'll speak
sicilian, or else I'll get up and go.

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:54.909
Let's proceed with calm,

01:33:55.004 --> 01:33:58.997
try at least to speak
a little more slowly.

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:00.631
Yeah, slowly...

01:34:00.677 --> 01:34:04.295
So, you were saying
that after you were attacked,

01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:06.887
you moved to Rome.

01:34:07.183 --> 01:34:08.514
Yes, to Rome.

01:34:10.645 --> 01:34:12.681
I went to look for mr pippo calo.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:14.314
Again...

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.523
- Since he commanded all of Rome.
- All lies.

01:34:18.403 --> 01:34:20.815
- But I mean, all of it.
- Yes, but look at me!

01:34:20.905 --> 01:34:23.066
Don't look there, look at me!

01:34:23.533 --> 01:34:26.821
Both because Rome could hide me
because Rome's big,

01:34:26.953 --> 01:34:31.196
and because I could go
and kill mr calo.

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:32.822
Judge Falcone.

01:34:32.959 --> 01:34:34.574
I hate them,

01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:38.287
because they killed my relatives.

01:34:39.799 --> 01:34:42.586
The main motive
for the killing was...

01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:48.467
Leaving?

01:34:48.808 --> 01:34:50.344
Yeah.

01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:54.594
One last cigarette?

01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:59.353
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:35:01.237 --> 01:35:03.853
You're not glad to be going home?

01:35:04.449 --> 01:35:07.987
America isn't my home,
my home is here.

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.986
Of course, I'm happy to go back
to my wife, to my kids.

01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:14.242
I've had eight kids.

01:35:15.627 --> 01:35:19.119
My father did better than me,
I'm the last of seventeen.

01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:23.248
Judge Falcone, you don't...

01:35:25.136 --> 01:35:28.094
Life is not eternal,
it's better with kids.

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.096
I like kids.

01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:35.135
We'll wait for the sentence
and then who knows...

01:35:35.271 --> 01:35:36.886
Fair enough.

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:39.764
This war has just begun.

01:35:41.277 --> 01:35:43.609
The ones pulling the strings
are in Rome,

01:35:43.655 --> 01:35:46.397
that's where we need to go
without getting killed.

01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:48.902
Die in your own bed.

01:35:49.535 --> 01:35:51.275
And as late as possible.

01:35:51.788 --> 01:35:55.906
The mafia is not invincible,
it had a beginning, it will have an end.

01:35:57.168 --> 01:36:00.001
As soon as possible, let's hope,
so I can return to palermo

01:36:00.046 --> 01:36:02.628
and go eat a nice gelato in mondello.

01:36:09.806 --> 01:36:11.296
Have a good trip.

01:36:22.151 --> 01:36:23.812
Shall we go?

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:29.781
December 16, 1987 the sentence

01:36:37.583 --> 01:36:41.201

the first assizes court of palermo,

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:44.914

Winter 1990 Salem, New Hampshire

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:10.183
Light of my life, come here.

01:39:11.362 --> 01:39:12.477
Careful.

01:39:21.247 --> 01:39:22.987
What did you do today?

01:39:23.875 --> 01:39:26.742
Nothing, I went shopping.

01:39:28.838 --> 01:39:30.999
The life of the unemployed.

01:39:32.133 --> 01:39:34.875
- It was on sale.
- You already have a weapon.

01:39:35.011 --> 01:39:39.254
Yeah, but I feel safer.

01:39:39.724 --> 01:39:43.512
I promised Stefano I'd take him
to dinner with tommaso and his girl.

01:39:44.353 --> 01:39:45.638
Is that a problem?

01:39:46.481 --> 01:39:47.516
No.

01:40:42.703 --> 01:40:44.409
Like some wine?

01:40:44.789 --> 01:40:46.279
Sure, red.

01:40:49.168 --> 01:40:51.955
Good morning Italy, good morning Maria

01:40:52.463 --> 01:40:55.455
with your eyes so lacking in cheer

01:40:56.217 --> 01:40:58.458
good morning god to you

01:40:59.679 --> 01:41:02.421
you know I am here too

01:41:03.474 --> 01:41:06.466
let me sing to you

01:41:06.936 --> 01:41:09.678
my guitar I'll play too

01:41:10.106 --> 01:41:16.727
let me sing a nice slow song to you

01:41:17.697 --> 01:41:20.234
let me sing loud

01:41:21.117 --> 01:41:23.984
because I am proud

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:27.111
I am sicilian

01:41:28.499 --> 01:41:31.991
I am sicilian and I'm proud

01:41:37.967 --> 01:41:39.582
Let's go home.

01:43:22.196 --> 01:43:23.606
The roof?

01:43:23.948 --> 01:43:27.987
It opens and closes...
That way your cuckold's horns stick out.

01:43:33.332 --> 01:43:35.197
If you can eat in the car?

01:43:35.584 --> 01:43:37.700
Bring what you want and eat it.

01:43:39.505 --> 01:43:41.996
Ah, heating! It's got it.

01:43:46.637 --> 01:43:51.757
Pussy? Yeah, your sister's pussy...

01:43:52.017 --> 01:43:55.509
You're really pissing me off,
we've been talking for three hours

01:43:55.646 --> 01:43:57.887
take the keys and go to the boss.

01:44:00.651 --> 01:44:03.893
Ah, the money... 5,000 dollars.

01:44:04.113 --> 01:44:06.900
Come on, move it, you're pissing me off.

01:44:09.243 --> 01:44:12.235
Get outta here, go. Useless thing.

01:44:12.913 --> 01:44:15.871
- Is he taking it?
- Of course he's taking it.

01:44:16.417 --> 01:44:18.908
He's holding the keys,
he has to take it.

01:44:19.044 --> 01:44:21.660
It was like a conversation
between deaf-mutes.

01:44:22.173 --> 01:44:24.880
You still haven't learned english?

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:27.166
I don't even speak Italian,
let alone english.

01:44:27.303 --> 01:44:29.294
Anyway, I talk with my hands.

01:44:33.309 --> 01:44:35.265
Why did you call me?

01:44:37.188 --> 01:44:39.019
I'll show you this cool car.

01:44:43.068 --> 01:44:45.024
I haven't got any money.

01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:52.817
- Earning well?
- Earning.

01:44:54.079 --> 01:44:56.195
We get by, thank god.

01:44:57.208 --> 01:44:58.698
We get by...

01:44:58.834 --> 01:45:01.450
We were used to millions, billions...

01:45:03.714 --> 01:45:05.955
Now I have to let my wife support me.

01:45:07.343 --> 01:45:09.174
That bugs me.

01:45:14.058 --> 01:45:17.346
What's that? A gun in your pocket?

01:45:18.103 --> 01:45:20.685
I always carry it here, on me,

01:45:21.357 --> 01:45:23.097
like John Wayne.

01:45:23.859 --> 01:45:25.565
And Gary Cooper...

01:45:26.111 --> 01:45:29.103
But I'll leave it here,
I'll find something in palermo.

01:45:29.698 --> 01:45:33.862
Revolvers, kalashnikovs, grenades,
whatever you want.

01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:36.827
You're going back to palermo, to Italy?

01:45:37.623 --> 01:45:39.989
I can't relax until
I've sorted everything out.

01:45:40.251 --> 01:45:44.711
Riina is still alive, I can't rest
until I've whacked him.

01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:46.245
By yourself?

01:45:47.216 --> 01:45:49.582
- You wanna get killed?
- I'm not alone.

01:45:50.135 --> 01:45:52.626
Besides, I got nothing to lose.

01:45:53.097 --> 01:45:56.510
But I gotta kill riina and calo,
no two ways about it.

01:45:56.976 --> 01:46:00.639
Calo's in prison, he needs
to stay there the rest of his life.

01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:02.136
I know,

01:46:02.982 --> 01:46:04.597
but my plan's good.

01:46:05.776 --> 01:46:08.233
To begin with, I pop riina,

01:46:08.279 --> 01:46:12.648
then I let them catch me
and put me in prison with calo.

01:46:13.409 --> 01:46:14.899
In novara?

01:46:19.999 --> 01:46:22.285
He's got important connections.

01:46:22.668 --> 01:46:25.410
He'll end up escaping,
do we let him escape?

01:46:26.672 --> 01:46:28.412
You're crazy.

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.540
I know.

01:46:32.928 --> 01:46:34.919
That's what my head tells me.

01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:37.421
- What about your wife?
- She'll wait.

01:46:37.516 --> 01:46:39.427
- Here?
- She'll wait for me here.

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:43.678
She knows I can't change,
I'm a free spirit.

01:46:45.274 --> 01:46:47.686
Not even god almighty
can change me.

01:46:48.193 --> 01:46:50.434
And you'll go back to Italy, to sicily,

01:46:51.906 --> 01:46:53.817
the gelato in mondello...

01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:57.157
That was the last thing
I said to Falcone

01:46:57.202 --> 01:46:58.908
when we said goodbye.

01:47:03.459 --> 01:47:05.199
He shook my hand.

01:47:10.215 --> 01:47:15.960
May 23, 1992 capaci, palermo

01:47:22.061 --> 01:47:23.722
Shall I pour the coffee?

01:47:33.739 --> 01:47:36.981
I'll give the keys to giuseppe,
I'll see you tonight at home.

01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:39.198
All right.

01:48:28.252 --> 01:48:32.791
Good evening, here are the first
images of the shocking attack

01:48:33.048 --> 01:48:36.666
in which judge Giovanni Falcone
lost his life...

01:48:47.563 --> 01:48:50.054
Let's celebrate this great cuckold!

01:48:53.819 --> 01:48:56.310
At last you're out of the fucking way!

01:48:58.824 --> 01:49:02.316
To the judge's good health!

01:49:04.038 --> 01:49:07.201
Dramatic scenes, scenes of warfare.

01:49:07.416 --> 01:49:11.455
That soil covers what was once

01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:14.958
a tract of the 20km highway...

01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:17.706
Disgusting piece of shit, dead at last!

01:49:18.469 --> 01:49:19.834
Dog!

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.051
Useless thing!

01:49:24.058 --> 01:49:27.346
He's fucked off out of the way! Cheers!

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:56.996
For those of us present,

01:49:57.257 --> 01:50:00.249
because celebrating the lord's easter

01:50:00.636 --> 01:50:04.629
we may die to sin
and rise again to new life,

01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:06.630
let us pray.

01:50:09.019 --> 01:50:11.385
L, rosaria costa,

01:50:12.022 --> 01:50:14.604
widow of officer vito schifani...

01:50:16.401 --> 01:50:18.266
In the name of all those

01:50:22.908 --> 01:50:27.777
I ask first that justice be done, now.

01:50:28.413 --> 01:50:31.029
Speaking to the men of the mafia,

01:50:31.166 --> 01:50:34.374
because they are in here,
certainly not christians,

01:50:34.419 --> 01:50:39.789
know that you too can be forgiven.

01:50:40.175 --> 01:50:43.292
I forgive you,
but you have to kneel down.

01:50:44.179 --> 01:50:48.513
If you have the courage to change...
But they won't change.

01:50:49.893 --> 01:50:52.009
I've got to go back to Italy.

01:50:53.188 --> 01:50:57.272
Why do you have to go back?
Did de gennaro ask you to?

01:50:59.945 --> 01:51:02.937
I want to go back to Italy.

01:51:04.324 --> 01:51:06.155
I promised Falcone.

01:51:06.702 --> 01:51:08.442
You promised him?

01:51:08.829 --> 01:51:12.447
- But Falcone's dead.
- I have to go and that's it!

01:51:15.085 --> 01:51:17.201
You and Stefano will come with me.

01:51:17.296 --> 01:51:20.288
I'm not coming and nor is Stefano.

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.290
He has school

01:51:23.927 --> 01:51:25.667
and I work.

01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:28.962
Cristina!

01:51:33.854 --> 01:51:35.594
We commend, lord,

01:51:35.731 --> 01:51:39.849
the faithful souls of our brothers

01:51:40.736 --> 01:51:45.446
Giovanni, Francesca,
Antonio, Rocco, vito,

01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:49.984
who have departed this world
that they may live with you.

01:51:57.211 --> 01:52:04.458
January 15, 1993 palermo

01:52:05.135 --> 01:52:07.592
- everyone ready?
- Ready.

01:52:09.264 --> 01:52:11.129
Go around.

01:52:15.354 --> 01:52:17.845
Stay on his tall.

01:52:27.908 --> 01:52:29.739
Again.

01:52:32.663 --> 01:52:34.904
Keep going around.

01:52:45.884 --> 01:52:47.499
Don't touch the gun.

01:52:51.056 --> 01:52:54.298
You got the wrong person,
my name's Alfredo bartolo.

01:53:08.573 --> 01:53:10.655
November 19, 1993
rebibbia, bunker courtroom

01:53:10.701 --> 01:53:13.909
- you claim you do not know buscetta.
- I do not know him.

01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:19.164
You reject the allegations
made against you by the prosecutor,

01:53:19.334 --> 01:53:22.326
based on declarations made by buscetta,

01:53:22.546 --> 01:53:26.459
contorno, mutolo, marchese,
di maggio, calderone

01:53:27.217 --> 01:53:29.833
and you declare that
you do not know these persons

01:53:30.053 --> 01:53:34.843
and you don't belong to the criminal
association called cosa nostra.

01:53:35.309 --> 01:53:38.426
- Do you confirm this?
- Yes, I confirm it.

01:53:38.979 --> 01:53:41.220
Listen, riina,

01:53:41.857 --> 01:53:44.223
when you refused

01:53:44.359 --> 01:53:47.066
to submit to cross-examination
with buscetta,

01:53:47.112 --> 01:53:50.479
you made this statement,
which I shall now read out.

01:53:51.116 --> 01:53:55.325
"Buscetta is not of my stature,
he is a man with too many lovers."

01:53:55.746 --> 01:53:57.577
How do you know that?

01:53:57.873 --> 01:54:00.489
I didn't say "lovers", I said "wives".

01:54:00.625 --> 01:54:03.617
All right, wives, lovers...
We get the point.

01:54:04.713 --> 01:54:06.374
So you know him?

01:54:07.257 --> 01:54:10.465
I read in the papers
that he had three wives,

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:14.253
he didn't love his kids,
he abandoned them.

01:54:14.848 --> 01:54:18.215
I cannot speak to anyone
with such low morals.

01:54:19.853 --> 01:54:23.220
When I speak of morals, mr president,

01:54:24.274 --> 01:54:26.105
I'm referring to my family.

01:54:26.777 --> 01:54:30.144
My grandfather was widowed at forty

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:32.737
and he had five children.

01:54:33.408 --> 01:54:35.364
He never remarried.

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:38.777
My mother was widowed at thirty-six.

01:54:40.499 --> 01:54:43.491
In our village, corleone,

01:54:43.794 --> 01:54:45.534
we live with moral rectitude.

01:54:45.796 --> 01:54:49.755
No one wants to force you
to face buscetta,

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:54.635
but you specifically
asked to face him, and not only.

01:54:54.679 --> 01:54:57.762
Your honor, please do not insist.

01:54:57.808 --> 01:55:00.424
No, of course not, it's your right.

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:03.393
I have already explained
that I don't want to face him,

01:55:03.438 --> 01:55:06.646
that is my right
and I shall exercise it.

01:55:06.691 --> 01:55:08.932
- Do I have the right to speak?
- Certainly.

01:55:09.027 --> 01:55:12.019
Shit stain! Cuckold!

01:55:12.072 --> 01:55:16.532
Silence, please!

01:55:18.662 --> 01:55:20.573
Silence, please!

01:55:22.082 --> 01:55:23.947
Speak clean.

01:55:24.418 --> 01:55:26.909
Silence in there, please!

01:55:29.047 --> 01:55:31.959
And you, enough with the flashes,
or I'll send you out!

01:55:32.551 --> 01:55:34.087
No swearing.

01:55:34.177 --> 01:55:36.589
You have the right
to ask whatever you want

01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:38.341
to mr riina.

01:55:48.483 --> 01:55:51.099
I was expecting a lion's roar,

01:55:51.945 --> 01:55:54.311
I heard the squeak of a mouse.

01:55:56.616 --> 01:56:00.734
From what pulpit does
this man preach, if you allow me...

01:56:01.872 --> 01:56:04.739
How dare he talk about morality?

01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:08.242
He, who has slaughtered
and ordered the slaughter

01:56:08.503 --> 01:56:10.368
of so many innocent men.

01:56:11.465 --> 01:56:13.751
I chased after women, it's true,

01:56:13.842 --> 01:56:17.209
you went to bed only with your wife

01:56:17.262 --> 01:56:20.004
because all your time
was for cosa nostra.

01:56:21.016 --> 01:56:24.759
To be the star, the boss of all bosses.

01:56:26.271 --> 01:56:30.389
And now you're locked in a cage
where you'll stay all your life.

01:56:31.776 --> 01:56:34.267
Riina, are you amused?

01:56:34.779 --> 01:56:36.861
Will you tell us what amuses you?

01:56:37.782 --> 01:56:39.272
No comment.

01:56:39.784 --> 01:56:42.116
Is it an ironic or a sarcastic smile?

01:56:43.038 --> 01:56:44.744
Do you know the difference?

01:56:46.166 --> 01:56:48.407
Mr president, twenty years ago,

01:56:48.543 --> 01:56:53.037
a judge said: "The mafia will end
when a mafioso talks."

01:56:53.757 --> 01:56:58.046
Now it's not just me who's talking,
lots of people are talking.

01:56:58.803 --> 01:57:01.670
But they won't be the ones
to destroy cosa nostra.

01:57:02.933 --> 01:57:04.548
You have him in front of you,

01:57:05.644 --> 01:57:07.180
sitting in that chair,

01:57:07.312 --> 01:57:10.145
the man who helped the state

01:57:11.566 --> 01:57:13.306
defeat cosa nostra.

01:57:14.402 --> 01:57:17.189
It's you, Salvatore riina,

01:57:17.322 --> 01:57:19.062
mr riina,

01:57:20.659 --> 01:57:22.524
the man who killed cosa nostra.

01:57:25.330 --> 01:57:28.072
And this is why, not so much me,

01:57:29.084 --> 01:57:31.200
but all of cosa nostra hates you.

01:57:31.836 --> 01:57:33.326
I don't hate you,

01:57:34.464 --> 01:57:36.455
if I hated you I'd do you a favor.

01:57:38.843 --> 01:57:40.458
For me you don't exist.

01:57:44.683 --> 01:57:46.799
If you have nothing else to add...

01:57:46.977 --> 01:57:49.593
It was a cross-examination
and only I am speaking.

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:52.345
Riina, have you anything to say?

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:55.352
Enough, your honor.
I've already spoken.

01:57:55.735 --> 01:57:57.350
Have you anything to add?

01:57:57.445 --> 01:57:59.731
I can stay here all night...

01:57:59.864 --> 01:58:02.947
Then, if you have nothing to add,
you may be excused.

01:58:03.618 --> 01:58:06.109
- Thank you.
- You too.

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:08.827
You too.

01:58:14.588 --> 01:58:17.955
Bring in the next witness:
Salvatore cancemi.

01:58:41.906 --> 01:58:44.397
He didn't want to give me
the satisfaction.

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:53.782
Salvatore cancemi,
have you decided to collaborate?

01:58:54.544 --> 01:58:57.286
Yes, I decided to collaborate

01:58:58.173 --> 01:59:01.256
when Salvatore riina began order

01:59:01.551 --> 01:59:03.792
to have his enemies killed,

01:59:04.429 --> 01:59:06.670
up to the twentieth degree of relation,

01:59:07.015 --> 01:59:09.552
starting with children of six years old,

01:59:09.934 --> 01:59:12.550
because he said:
"The seed must disappear".

01:59:12.687 --> 01:59:14.302
That is?

01:59:14.939 --> 01:59:17.681
- If I may, mr president...
- Please.

01:59:18.443 --> 01:59:20.525
Seed is blood,

01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:23.311
those with buscetta's blood, bontade's,

01:59:23.448 --> 01:59:25.564
the inzerillos', the contornos',

01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:28.658
must be killed, wiped out.

01:59:29.579 --> 01:59:34.323
Everyone, from the elderly
to the children, no one must remain.

01:59:34.584 --> 01:59:35.949
Thank you, counselor.

01:59:36.086 --> 01:59:40.079
Cancemi, you mentioned many crimes,

01:59:41.716 --> 01:59:44.799
how many of these crimes
are you stained with?

01:59:45.595 --> 01:59:47.176
A lot.

01:59:47.722 --> 01:59:51.965
I made a list that I handed
to the examining magistrate.

01:59:52.977 --> 01:59:54.968
Does this list include

01:59:55.063 --> 01:59:59.181
Antonio and benedetto buscetta,
tommaso buscetta's sons?

01:59:59.234 --> 02:00:02.476
Yes, tommaso buscetta's sons

02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:05.858
were killed by me and pippo calo.

02:00:06.199 --> 02:00:08.736
What the fuck are you saying?

02:00:09.369 --> 02:00:10.825
You need to shut up!

02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:14.488
- You and me chocked buscetta's sons.
- Shut up!

02:00:14.624 --> 02:00:18.208
You and me chocked buscetta's sons,

02:00:18.253 --> 02:00:21.336
who you'd known since they were kids.

02:00:21.381 --> 02:00:22.996
Shut up, filthy rat!

02:00:23.091 --> 02:00:27.460
You took the one
that looked most like buscetta!

02:00:27.512 --> 02:00:30.345
- How much more crap you gotta talk?
- Silence!

02:00:31.099 --> 02:00:33.886
- Which of buscetta's two sons?
- Benedetto.

02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:39.471
- Where's your father?
- I don't know.

02:00:39.524 --> 02:00:42.482
You have to tell me
where your father is. Where is he?

02:00:42.527 --> 02:00:44.483
- Leave me alone.
- Where is he?

02:00:45.905 --> 02:00:48.271
You don't know where your father is?

02:00:48.408 --> 02:00:50.023
You don't know?

02:00:55.415 --> 02:00:57.371
Where's your father?

02:00:57.417 --> 02:01:00.625
What do you want from me?
I haven't done anything.

02:01:00.670 --> 02:01:03.036
Tell me where he is
and [I'll leave you alone.

02:01:03.131 --> 02:01:04.917
Leave me alone!

02:01:08.762 --> 02:01:11.424
Antonio, benedetto,

02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:14.263
for the last time, where is your father?

02:01:15.685 --> 02:01:19.018
I don't know where my father is!

02:01:19.063 --> 02:01:20.928
Don't you get it?

02:01:31.785 --> 02:01:33.446
Leave benedetto for me.

02:01:33.912 --> 02:01:35.277
All right.

02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:19.203
I should have forced them
to come to Brazil with me,

02:02:19.374 --> 02:02:21.990
I was their father,
I should have forced them.

02:02:23.127 --> 02:02:26.369
People listen to me when I speak.

02:02:28.258 --> 02:02:30.874
I'm able to persuade them, I know.

02:02:31.636 --> 02:02:34.753
"Come with me and that's all..."
And I didn't give a damn.

02:02:35.223 --> 02:02:38.511
I didn't think about them.

02:02:41.521 --> 02:02:43.762
I didn't even give them
the freedom to betray me,

02:02:43.898 --> 02:02:46.264
they didn't know where I was.

02:02:47.652 --> 02:02:50.485
I was tortured, I know what that means,

02:02:50.530 --> 02:02:53.647
but I wasn't afraid, I was strong,

02:02:53.741 --> 02:02:56.858
but to take it out on them was cowardly,

02:02:56.911 --> 02:03:00.369
because they weren't anybody,
they didn't count for anything.

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.031
By themselves...

02:03:03.793 --> 02:03:05.374
They were my kids!

02:03:13.511 --> 02:03:15.297
Those hands...

02:03:18.433 --> 02:03:21.425
I remember, he caressed them as kids,

02:03:24.314 --> 02:03:26.646
he took them down
from their high chairs.

02:03:29.569 --> 02:03:33.562
Calo strangled them,
looking them in the eye till the end.

02:03:39.203 --> 02:03:41.535
The bastard's gotta die!

02:03:42.707 --> 02:03:46.950
Asinara island
maximum security prison

02:04:19.619 --> 02:04:21.109
Tommaso buscetta,

02:04:21.871 --> 02:04:26.615
you have always reaffirmed your
accusations against the corleonesi...

02:04:26.834 --> 02:04:29.200
No details: No hands, no watch.

02:04:29.379 --> 02:04:30.619
Sure.

02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:35.123
Today, you are taking a step you
hadn't wished to take in the past,

02:04:35.343 --> 02:04:38.255
you accuse politicians
and what politicians.

02:04:38.471 --> 02:04:40.086
Why have you changed your mind?

02:04:41.265 --> 02:04:43.881
I owe it to judge Falcone,

02:04:45.353 --> 02:04:46.889
to his memory.

02:04:47.230 --> 02:04:49.391
What was your relationship
with Falcone?

02:04:50.024 --> 02:04:53.266
I loved Giovanni Falcone,

02:04:54.028 --> 02:04:55.893
may he rest in peace.

02:04:56.531 --> 02:05:00.774
I liked talking with him,
reasoning, discussing.

02:05:02.537 --> 02:05:05.153
Even arguing, at times.

02:05:05.248 --> 02:05:07.284
I liked his mind,

02:05:07.375 --> 02:05:09.161
his brain.

02:05:11.546 --> 02:05:13.161
He was the only one

02:05:13.297 --> 02:05:18.508
who always understood what I said...
And what I did not say.

02:05:18.803 --> 02:05:22.546
- You're not afraid...
- I'm not afraid of anyone.

02:05:23.433 --> 02:05:24.798
Not even of dying.

02:05:26.144 --> 02:05:31.059
I am only a small man
who had dignity in spades

02:05:31.190 --> 02:05:34.398
and I have to tell the truth,
what I know.

02:05:34.819 --> 02:05:37.652
Bringing up
the most important Italian politician,

02:05:37.697 --> 02:05:41.189
accusing him directly and indirectly,

02:05:41.325 --> 02:05:43.441
it is up to the magistrates
to establish it,

02:05:43.578 --> 02:05:45.944
of ordering at least two killings.

02:05:46.330 --> 02:05:50.198
You were right, it is up
to the magistrates to decide.

02:05:50.710 --> 02:05:53.201
"Cosa nostra knows how to wait",

02:05:53.337 --> 02:05:55.419
those are your words.

02:05:55.965 --> 02:05:57.956
Do you feel you're in danger?

02:05:58.342 --> 02:06:00.708
Yes, but I'm used to it now.

02:06:02.722 --> 02:06:07.182
It's not so much
what tommaso buscetta is,

02:06:08.603 --> 02:06:10.935
it's that I have become a legend,

02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:13.687
and it's this legend that cosa nostra
wants to destroy,

02:06:13.733 --> 02:06:17.191
to lift its head up again,
to get back on its feet,

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:20.444
to breathe free now
that has a death rattle,

02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:23.072
because cosa nostra has a death rattle.

02:06:23.367 --> 02:06:26.200
We thank tommaso buscetta
for his time.

02:06:26.245 --> 02:06:28.952
See you next week. Good night.

02:06:33.002 --> 02:06:35.960
Andreotti trial Rome, 1996

02:06:36.005 --> 02:06:39.122
- not many people.
- It's gone outta style.

02:06:47.642 --> 02:06:51.009
Save your voice because tonight
we'll sing and dance.

02:06:53.773 --> 02:06:55.354
Go in, please.

02:06:55.900 --> 02:06:57.390
I'll go in alone.

02:07:05.243 --> 02:07:09.532
Buscetta, read the statement and
give us your name and particulars.

02:07:12.041 --> 02:07:15.283
Aware of the moral
and legal responsibilities

02:07:15.378 --> 02:07:17.494
I assume with my deposition,

02:07:17.547 --> 02:07:19.754
I swear to tell the truth

02:07:19.799 --> 02:07:22.632
and to hide nothing
of which I have knowledge.

02:07:23.052 --> 02:07:27.386
Buscetta tommaso.
Born palermo, July 13, 1928.

02:07:28.683 --> 02:07:31.049
Good, you may be seated.

02:07:31.561 --> 02:07:34.143
- Good morning, mr president.
- Good morning to you.

02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:41.017
Counselor coppi,
you may question the witness.

02:07:44.198 --> 02:07:47.190
Mr buscetta, you have stated

02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:51.323
that tano badalamenti told you
that a specific task had been ordered

02:07:51.539 --> 02:07:53.530
by the honorable giulio andreotti

02:07:54.417 --> 02:07:56.328
to personages of the mafia,

02:07:56.586 --> 02:07:58.702
for them to eliminate pecorelli.

02:07:58.838 --> 02:08:02.956
The request was made to badalamenti
by the salvo cousins.

02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:05.211
No, I asked you something else.

02:08:05.303 --> 02:08:08.591
Did tano badalamenti tell you
there was a specific task

02:08:08.681 --> 02:08:11.593
requested by
the honorable giulio andreotti?

02:08:11.934 --> 02:08:15.597
No, there was no specific task.

02:08:15.688 --> 02:08:17.224
Not that I know of.

02:08:17.732 --> 02:08:22.476
So, the fact that you attribute the
honorable andreotti with an interest

02:08:22.612 --> 02:08:26.104
in killing mino pecorell,
Carlo Alberto dalla chiesa and others,

02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:30.984
is the result of direct knowledge
of yours or a deduction?

02:08:32.330 --> 02:08:35.822
- It is a deduction.
- But a deduction is not a proof.

02:08:37.126 --> 02:08:38.741
It's nothing.

02:08:39.253 --> 02:08:43.963
Mr buscetta, how many crimes
have you been charged with?

02:08:44.759 --> 02:08:45.965
Piece of shit.

02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:51.221
I was charged with murder and
concealment of a body in catanzaro,

02:08:51.265 --> 02:08:55.884
and I have been convicted three times
of criminal association.

02:08:57.021 --> 02:09:02.266
Were you not sentenced to eight years
in salerno or... taranto?

02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:03.975
I wouldn't want to be wrong.

02:09:04.111 --> 02:09:06.773
No, you're not wrong, I was sentenced

02:09:06.906 --> 02:09:09.898
to eight years' imprisonment

02:09:10.034 --> 02:09:12.525
for drug smuggling,

02:09:12.620 --> 02:09:15.532
in salerno, in...

02:09:24.674 --> 02:09:26.790
In 1975.

02:09:28.177 --> 02:09:30.133
Naturally, you were innocent.

02:09:30.179 --> 02:09:32.636
Not "naturally", I was innocent!

02:09:33.015 --> 02:09:34.505
Let's keep going.

02:09:34.809 --> 02:09:38.427
You have repeatedly maintained
that while you were in Brazil

02:09:38.521 --> 02:09:40.261
you attempted suicide,

02:09:40.314 --> 02:09:45.308
but did you really intend to die?

02:09:45.403 --> 02:09:48.895
Mr president,
the question is not relevant,

02:09:48.948 --> 02:09:52.566
we are entering into matters
that are not procedural.

02:09:52.702 --> 02:09:54.658
Objection overruled.

02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:57.445
Buscetta, answer me.

02:09:57.540 --> 02:10:02.580
Did you intend to kill yourself?

02:10:02.712 --> 02:10:04.043
Yes.

02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:06.829
And why?

02:10:09.427 --> 02:10:11.088
Out of love for my family.

02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:14.337
Do you deny that this attempted suicide

02:10:14.432 --> 02:10:18.721
was a means to avoid
or delay your extradition?

02:10:19.186 --> 02:10:20.471
I deny it.

02:10:20.855 --> 02:10:24.848
Mr buscetta,
when you attempted suicide,

02:10:24.942 --> 02:10:28.855
do you remember writing
on a piece of paper

02:10:28.988 --> 02:10:31.229
information that would have enabled

02:10:31.365 --> 02:10:34.949
the immediate identification
of the substance you had ingested?

02:10:36.871 --> 02:10:39.863
And yet there is a report from
the hospital you were admitted to

02:10:39.999 --> 02:10:42.991
saying that you wrote the letters

02:10:44.086 --> 02:10:46.372
s-t-r-y...

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:52.375
So they understood you had ingested
strychnine and could save you.

02:10:53.262 --> 02:10:55.127
They told me that, but I don't remember

02:10:55.264 --> 02:10:59.633
a doctor asking me, as he slapped me,

02:10:59.727 --> 02:11:03.265
"what have you taken?"
And me writing it on a piece of paper.

02:11:03.397 --> 02:11:07.140
- I was unconscious, I don't know.
- It's true.

02:11:07.526 --> 02:11:10.734
It's true because you wrote it
and it's documented.

02:11:11.364 --> 02:11:12.649
But let's keep going.

02:11:12.782 --> 02:11:17.025
Did you receive financial aid
from the state for collaborating?

02:11:17.161 --> 02:11:20.403
I began collaborating in 1984

02:11:20.539 --> 02:11:25.158
and I received
the first financial aid in 1992.

02:11:25.795 --> 02:11:28.787
In 1988, you received nothing?

02:11:30.424 --> 02:11:32.506
- Yes.
- You contradict yourself.

02:11:33.636 --> 02:11:35.046
Then, how much?

02:11:36.514 --> 02:11:38.379
- We received...
- We?

02:11:42.186 --> 02:11:46.805
I received 200 million lire
to help my family.

02:11:47.191 --> 02:11:51.434
200 million, does that not seem
like financial assistance?

02:11:52.905 --> 02:11:53.940
Yes.

02:11:54.073 --> 02:11:58.692
Do you currently undertake
any remunerative activity?

02:11:59.203 --> 02:12:00.409
None.

02:12:00.663 --> 02:12:05.532
So, what are your sources
of income, your livelihood?

02:12:07.211 --> 02:12:09.702
- The state.
- The state?

02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:13.831
And the income you receive,

02:12:14.718 --> 02:12:16.674
allows you

02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:19.587
to take cruises with your wife,

02:12:19.682 --> 02:12:21.798
to sing and dance?

02:12:22.435 --> 02:12:25.177
The cruise has nothing to do

02:12:25.229 --> 02:12:27.220
with the aid the government gives me.

02:12:27.356 --> 02:12:32.225
- It's from other proceeds.
- Excuse me, what are they?

02:12:32.319 --> 02:12:34.105
Writing books.

02:12:35.197 --> 02:12:38.064
So you paid for the cruise
with your own money?

02:12:38.117 --> 02:12:39.948
Yes, with my own money.

02:12:40.744 --> 02:12:43.451
- Can you prove it?
- How can I?

02:12:43.497 --> 02:12:45.488
You can't, of course.

02:12:45.583 --> 02:12:48.700
And 20 million for plastic surgery

02:12:48.752 --> 02:12:52.119
with dr barzi, who paid for that?

02:12:52.715 --> 02:12:57.254
The state doesn't give you
all this money to lie.

02:12:57.595 --> 02:13:01.838
But I'm not lying, I'm trying
to tell things as they are.

02:13:02.141 --> 02:13:04.974
But then, if I am not able

02:13:05.019 --> 02:13:07.385
to translate it into words,

02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:09.971
it's because of my inadequate
education and I apologize.

02:13:10.024 --> 02:13:13.266
- You lied to Falcone, too.
- No, never.

02:13:13.736 --> 02:13:16.273
December 4, 1984,

02:13:16.363 --> 02:13:20.106
you told Falcone you suffered
from renal tuberculosis.

02:13:20.159 --> 02:13:23.401
No, I told Falcone

02:13:23.537 --> 02:13:28.031
that I pretended in prison,
that the disease was fake.

02:13:28.125 --> 02:13:30.867
- In fact, it was fake.
- I just said so.

02:13:31.253 --> 02:13:34.120
You lie constantly, you are a liar!

02:13:34.173 --> 02:13:37.791
I object, these questions
aren't relevant.

02:13:37.927 --> 02:13:40.168
But they are relevant, counselor.

02:13:40.262 --> 02:13:43.675
Because the witness lies
about everything.

02:13:44.683 --> 02:13:47.800
And so, buscetta, let me say I,

02:13:47.895 --> 02:13:49.431
you are unreliable.

02:13:57.071 --> 02:13:58.936
Masino...

02:14:00.783 --> 02:14:02.319
Go on,

02:14:03.285 --> 02:14:06.698
sing a little song for us, too.

02:14:09.583 --> 02:14:13.167
Let me sing to you

02:14:14.338 --> 02:14:18.422
my guitar I'll play too

02:14:20.469 --> 02:14:23.427
I'm sicilian

02:14:24.473 --> 02:14:27.556
I'm sicilian and I'm proud

02:14:30.604 --> 02:14:34.313
why are you looking at me like that?

02:15:26.410 --> 02:15:28.867
Let's go, the cake!

02:15:35.878 --> 02:15:38.244
In honor of masino!

02:15:41.008 --> 02:15:42.748
Marvelous!

02:15:42.801 --> 02:15:45.042
Look what's written on it.

02:15:45.804 --> 02:15:47.385
Read it, come.

02:15:48.057 --> 02:15:51.515
