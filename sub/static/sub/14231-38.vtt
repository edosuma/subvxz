01:14.699 --> 01:17.827
Oh, sure hope this resumé gets me a job.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.080
I gotta start paying off
a few of these bills.

01:20.705 --> 01:22.832

Oof!

01:32.926 --> 01:34.302
Dad, is that you?

01:34.386 --> 01:37.764
Uh, I'm not sure. Kinda dark in here.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.813
Guess I got buried in my work, Son.
Ah-hyuck!

01:44.896 --> 01:46.648
Whatcha got there, Maxie?

01:46.731 --> 01:48.441
My science report.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.276
I did it on Einstein.

01:50.360 --> 01:55.156
Einstein was one of my favorites,
especially in the Bride of Einstein.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.784
Uh, Dad, that's Frankenstein.

01:58.410 --> 02:01.121
Ooh, guess he changed his name
when he came over to this country.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.581
I'll read it right away,

02:03.665 --> 02:07.043
but first I got to mail off
my job application. Whoa!

02:09.963 --> 02:13.758
I'm applyin' for a part-time janitor job
at Rocketdarn.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.635
Good luck, Pop. Hope you get it.

02:17.512 --> 02:21.141
Whoa. Maybe then you can get
to the bills in the kitchen.

02:21.224 --> 02:24.019
Hmm. Now where'd I put that resumé?

02:24.102 --> 02:25.103
Here it is.

02:25.186 --> 02:29.774
Bet them Rocketdarn folks
will be darn impressed by my credentials.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.652
Just attach my photo to it,
and I'll be all set.

Well, sure. Mr Government Grant.

-[murmuring]
-I'd like to watch.

02:56.384 --> 03:00.138
Boys, I think we found us a real McCoy.

03:00.221 --> 03:03.099
This fella's a regular Einstein.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.185
-[murmuring]
-Now pass this around.

03:05.268 --> 03:09.064
I want you boys to see
what a real genius looks like.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.866
Here, Maxie. Keep plungin'.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.829
Hello? Hello, Professor?

03:24.913 --> 03:28.750
This is Red Crocker
from over at Rocketdarn.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.669
Are you indisposed?

03:30.752 --> 03:34.381
Nope. In the kitchen.
Just trying to clear up the black hole.

03:34.464 --> 03:38.677
[chuckles] Yeah, yeah. Well, my boys
have been workin' on that one

03:38.760 --> 03:41.054
for about the last 20 years.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.771
Well, it's all cleared up now.

03:49.854 --> 03:55.610
Boys, Professor Goof just put the kabosh
on the black hole mystery.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.862
-Oh, that's amazing.
-[murmuring]

03:57.946 --> 04:01.199
Professor, I'm gonna cut
right to the chase here

04:01.282 --> 04:04.285
and tell you we'd just
like to get you onboard

04:04.369 --> 04:06.121
here at Rocketdarn a-s-a-p.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.206
You mean I got the job?

04:08.289 --> 04:11.751
Thanks! And a-s-a-p to you, too! Ah-hyuck!

04:17.257 --> 04:19.342
A janitor, you say?

04:19.426 --> 04:24.222
Oh, Goofster, you think you can handle
such an important position?

04:24.305 --> 04:26.016
I hope so, Petey.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.226
Bills have been pourin'
in fast and curious.

04:32.522 --> 04:36.067
Boy, Petey, sure wish
I could spend the day relaxin' like you.

04:36.151 --> 04:39.779
But I owe, I owe,
so it's off to work I go.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.084
Got a delivery. Sign here.

04:56.046 --> 05:00.675
Swell! It's the surplus I ordered
from Dogface of Fortune magazine.

05:00.759 --> 05:04.596
A lifetime supply for 500 simoleans.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.307
Could be anything.
carburetors from old tanks,

05:07.390 --> 05:10.435
engines from old planes,
maybe even a hand grenade or two!

05:10.518 --> 05:11.895
Ha ha ha!

05:12.395 --> 05:16.316
Whatever it is,
I'll make a fortune resellin' it!

05:21.738 --> 05:24.574
Hey, I didn't order this junk.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.950
[delivery man] This your signature?

05:26.034 --> 05:27.744
Well, yeah.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.037
Then they're yours.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.542
But this is a mistake!
I don't even know what these things are!

05:34.626 --> 05:36.836
You shoulda thought of that
before you ordered them.

05:42.258 --> 05:45.637
[Crocker] Professor,
I just want to say welcome aboard.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.598
Come right this way.
I'll give you the 10-cent tour.

05:49.599 --> 05:53.687
Gawrsh! Can it wait till payday?
I'm a little low on cash.

05:54.145 --> 05:58.608
As you can see, Professor,
my boys have burned a lot of midnight oil

05:58.692 --> 06:01.736
tryin' to solve this
pesky little fuel problem.

06:02.278 --> 06:05.115
Any ideas how we can clean up this mess?

06:06.282 --> 06:07.450
Hmm...maybe.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.875
Perhaps, uh, possibly.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.595
Oh, my goodness!

06:29.014 --> 06:30.807
The professor's right.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.226
We've been ridin' down
the wrong path, boys.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.479
Time to double back and see
where we lost the scent.

06:36.563 --> 06:42.402
You know, you have the most unique brain
I've ever encountered, Professor Goof.

06:42.736 --> 06:46.906
Yep. They been tellin' me
that my whole life. Ah-hyuck!

06:49.617 --> 06:53.329
[Crocker] And I'm particularly proud
of the work we do here

06:53.413 --> 06:58.376
slapping together all the gizmos
and doodads that make up our rockets.

07:03.715 --> 07:04.591
[coughs]

07:05.300 --> 07:07.552
Looks like you need to clean house.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.430
What was that? Clean house?

07:10.680 --> 07:12.474
Sounds a little drastic.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.769
Some of these boys have been with me
for 20 years.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.228
They're like family.

07:17.312 --> 07:20.357
Then again, I can't stand my family.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.733
Fire 'em all!

07:23.109 --> 07:24.861
Well, that's that. Come on, Professor.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.614
I want to show you my pride and joy.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.742
Good. Been wonderin'
where you keep the detergent.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.244
[Crocker] Well, there she is.

07:33.328 --> 07:36.539
That little lady's
the reason we're all here.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.626
What do you think of her, Professor?

07:40.752 --> 07:41.711
[squeaks]

07:43.546 --> 07:45.590
Hmm. I think she needs to be scrubbed.

07:45.674 --> 07:51.012
Scrub the mission? Are you sure?
Isn't there some other way?

07:51.096 --> 07:54.724
Afraid not.
The longer you wait, the worse it'll get.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.645
Five billion smackers down the drain.

07:58.728 --> 08:03.108
I know how you feel.
Me and Maxie got bad drain problems, too.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.527
[Pete] Well, look, pal,

08:05.610 --> 08:08.071
I'm only supposed to
sell one to a customer,

08:08.154 --> 08:12.158
but because I like you,
and I really mean that,

08:12.242 --> 08:14.411
you can have all 10,000.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.496
Eh, what's it do?

08:17.122 --> 08:20.792
Ha ha! If I knew that,
I'd have to charge you extra.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.295
Yeah, right!

08:26.506 --> 08:30.301
I gotta find some way of
unloadin' these things.

08:30.802 --> 08:35.015
[Crocker] Professor Goof, you know,
you've opened my eyes to the fact

08:35.098 --> 08:37.684
that our space program is in worse trouble

08:37.767 --> 08:42.022
than a long-tailed cat
in a room full of rockin' chairs.

08:42.105 --> 08:46.359
But with your help, I'm hopin'
we can clean up this mess we're in.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.863
That's why I'm here, to clean up the mess.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.283
I like that attitude.
I like that attitude!

08:53.366 --> 08:56.327
Now, how long do you think
it'll take, Professor Goof?

08:56.411 --> 08:58.496
Couple hours, I guess.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.665
That's it? But how?

09:00.749 --> 09:03.501
I start at the bottom and work my way up.

09:03.585 --> 09:07.881
There. You see, boys?
What am I always telling you?

09:07.964 --> 09:11.343
A strong foundation
is the key to good science.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.512
Professor Goof,
I'm considering submitting you

09:14.596 --> 09:16.264
for a Nobel Prize.

09:16.348 --> 09:19.142
Gawrsh! They sure know
how to make a janitor

09:19.225 --> 09:21.311
feel important around here.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.605
Not even one sold.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.691
Things can't get much worse than this.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.779
Hey, Mac, I found part of your order
in the back of my truck.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.822
No!

09:35.950 --> 09:38.536
There's someone special
I'd like you to meet.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.300
Professor Goof, meet Saylor.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.387
Gawrsh! Sure is a cute little feller.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.888
Must be one of them pygmalions.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.769
Friendly, ain't he? Ah-hyuck!

10:02.852 --> 10:05.397
I'll leave you two alone

10:05.480 --> 10:10.318
so you can get started
on Saylor's training program a-s-a-p.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.570
A-s-a-p to you, too, sir!

10:18.743 --> 10:20.412
So you're gonna train me, huh?

10:20.495 --> 10:23.164
Petey always said
a monkey could do my job.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.001
Never knew one could be my boss, too.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.339
[chattering]

10:32.173 --> 10:34.509
Yes, sir! I won't let you down.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.429
I'll get this stain out in no time, sir.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.223
You're right. I need more water.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.643
There's so much I can learn
from you, Mr. Saylor.

10:43.727 --> 10:46.730
I admire your no-monkeyin'-around
can-do attitude

10:46.813 --> 10:48.565
and your years of experience,

10:48.648 --> 10:51.818
not to mention the way
you peel a banana with your feet.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.487
It's best to get on the boss' good side.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.989
[gibbering]

10:57.407 --> 11:00.410
Sorry, your monkeyness.
I'll have that cleaned up right away!

11:02.662 --> 11:04.831
[gibbering]

11:04.914 --> 11:07.542
No, sir!
Haven't forgotten about the stain.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.626
Right away, sir.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.172
Uh-oh.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.257
[both coughing]

11:16.926 --> 11:20.347
Gawrsh! This cleanin'
stuff sure is strong!

11:20.472 --> 11:22.265
Gets rid of the stains.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.602
Say, Professor Goof,
what's all the commotion about?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.520
I heard a big kaboom.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.689
Uh, well...

11:29.773 --> 11:32.609
Ohh, you're a genius.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.403
Say no more.
You're working on the big bang theory.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.030
Well, that's terrific.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.867
Listen, when do you think
you can schedule our launch date?

11:40.950 --> 11:44.204
Oh, how about tomorrow?
Usually have lunch around noon.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.747
Tomorrow?

11:45.830 --> 11:47.957
Tomorrow? Well, that's excellent!

11:48.041 --> 11:50.960
By the way, the scuttlebutt is

11:51.044 --> 11:53.713
that you're a shoo-in
for that Nobel Prize.

11:53.797 --> 11:58.259
Uh-oh. The boss looks upset
about not bein' invited to lunch.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.512
Time to score some more brownie points.

12:00.595 --> 12:04.015
Uh, Mr. Saylor,
would you honor me and Maxie

12:04.099 --> 12:06.142
by comin' to dinner at our house tonight?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.478
[hooting]

12:08.561 --> 12:10.647
Guess that's a yes. Ah-hyuck!

12:11.606 --> 12:14.234
[Goofy]
Maxie, I'd like you to meet my boss.

12:14.317 --> 12:15.568
Mr. Saylor.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.529
Dad, that's a monkey.

12:17.612 --> 12:18.571
[chattering]

12:18.655 --> 12:20.490
Maxie, he's a chimp.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.409
What are you tryin' to do, get me fired?

12:22.492 --> 12:25.078
Sorry, Dad. I didn't mean anything by it.

12:25.161 --> 12:29.332

12:36.506 --> 12:39.592
Heard you were havin' your boss
over for din-din.

12:40.010 --> 12:44.597
Thought I'd drop by
and put in a good word for you.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.892
Gawrsh! Thanks, Pete.
Don't mind if you do.

12:47.976 --> 12:51.521
Mr. Saylor's just finishin' up dessert.
I'll tell him you're here.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.235
Heh heh heh.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.321
Rocket companies use
all kind of weird gadgets.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.116
These things could make
me a bigrillionaire...

13:03.533 --> 13:04.868
Whatever they are.

13:04.951 --> 13:09.122
Saylor, old buddy, old pal, old chum,
call me Pete.

13:09.205 --> 13:13.376
I got somethin' here
just perfect for your spaced-out program.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.628
Pretty, ain't it? Heh heh.

13:15.712 --> 13:20.258
You can have 'em all
for let's say, oh, 10 grand.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.346
OK, that's real cute.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.930
Five grand?

13:27.599 --> 13:28.892
One grand?

make a monkey out of me?

13:34.022 --> 13:37.150
You shouldn't use the "M" word, Petey.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.909
No chimp's gonna make a chump out of me!

13:45.992 --> 13:49.454
Hey, I got me an idea.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.290
So, Professor Goof,

13:52.374 --> 13:55.293
how's our little training program
comin' along?

13:55.960 --> 13:59.964
Uh, I'm doin' my best, sir,
but it's not easy.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.343
Well, don't let it
get you down in the mouth.

14:03.426 --> 14:06.304
You can only expect so much
out of a dumb animal.

14:06.388 --> 14:10.308
Oh, I know, sir, but I'm really tryin'.

14:10.392 --> 14:14.104
Personally, I find
that using a banana as a reward

14:14.187 --> 14:15.271
gets results.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.357
It also builds self-esteem.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.819
-I'm willin' to try anything.

[Goofy] Hmm. Time to put
my elbows to the grindstone

14:46.928 --> 14:48.763
and use some nose grease.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.349
I won't let you down this time,
Mr. Saylor.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.935
I'll have this place looking
like there's no tomorrow,

14:54.019 --> 14:56.438
or my name isn't Fred-- Er, Goofy.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.982
Hmm. Almost had it right that time.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.827
All that's left is to check the attic
for some dust bunnies.

15:14.414 --> 15:18.460
All I gotta do is get this stuff
aboard that rocket ship,

15:18.543 --> 15:20.712
then sell 'em as space souvenirs.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.547
Halt! Who goes there?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.049
Uh, the Goofball's assistant--

15:24.132 --> 15:27.677
Uh, I mean, uh,
Professor Goof's personal attaché.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.471
Just go on through.

15:33.892 --> 15:38.313
Ha ha ha!
Once this rocket gets back to Earth,

15:38.396 --> 15:42.359
this junk'll be worth a fortune
as genuine space souvenirs.

16:11.179 --> 16:14.808
[Pete, laughing] What an idea this was!

16:14.891 --> 16:17.519
Maybe I'll sell 'em for 50 bucks each.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.813

Not bad. Better hurry.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.904
Hmm. Gettin' dark early.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.614
It's only 2 p.m.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.284
Petey! Why are you here?

16:33.368 --> 16:35.995
Well, I, uh... See, I, uh...

16:36.079 --> 16:39.833
I just dropped by to say hello.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.334
Hello.

16:41.376 --> 16:42.293
Hello.

16:42.377 --> 16:43.586
Well, see ya.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.255
Really enjoyed our chat, Petey.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.464
Whoa!

16:48.174 --> 16:53.013
Gawrsh! The rocket sure seems a lot taller
lookin' out from the inside.

16:53.096 --> 16:57.392
Pull me inside, you Goof!
We're headin' into outer space.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.895
I don't think so, Petey.
If we was, we'd be weightless.

17:00.979 --> 17:04.315
Whoa! Whoa!

17:05.025 --> 17:06.985
Whaddya say now, Goofbrain?

17:07.068 --> 17:08.903
Look at the bright side.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.906
You've been wanting to lose some weight.
Ah-hyuck!

17:19.330 --> 17:21.583
[gibbering]

17:21.666 --> 17:23.626
[Goofy] Hey, look. It's Mr. Saylor!

17:23.710 --> 17:25.420
Maybe he can do something.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.838
Oh, terrific.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.007
My life is in the hands of a dumb ape.

17:29.090 --> 17:32.260
You're wrong, Petey.
Mr. Saylor's very smart.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.803
I wasn't talkin' about him!

17:33.887 --> 17:37.098
You gotta get us down.
Try pushin' some buttons.

17:43.438 --> 17:44.689
Not that button!

17:51.696 --> 17:53.031
Not that one, either!

Hmm. Peanut butter and jelly. My favorite.

ordered a lift-off?

Well, I'll be.

then he uses himself as a guinea pig.

Now that's what I call the right stuff.

18:18.014 --> 18:23.019
Uh-oh. Got a situation here, boys.
They're almost outta fuel.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.232
Professor Goof, Red Crocker here.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.568
I got a tiny bit of bad news for you.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.904
I think you better sit down.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.742
Now, here's the long
and short of it, boys.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.412
The rocket's too heavy
with both of you aboard.

18:40.495 --> 18:43.790
She doesn't have enough fuel
to get you home.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.625
Too heavy?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.336
Hey! Let go, Petey!

18:48.420 --> 18:50.296
I don't wanna go outside!

18:51.131 --> 18:54.634
Now don't be such a baby.
The fresh air will do you good.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.678
[Crocker] That won't do you any good.

18:56.803 --> 19:00.348
Even if you unloaded everything
that wasn't nailed down,

19:00.432 --> 19:03.560
you still wouldn't have enough fuel
to run a lawn mower.

for a chimp.

We'll find out right after this
important message from our sponsor.

Just tidying up a little, Petey.

20:14.172 --> 20:17.801
I figure if we got to go,
might as well go in a clean ship.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.678
Put on some clean underwear, too.

are you sure you won't reconsider

21:35.128 --> 21:37.130

Ooh, thanks, but since I got
all my bills paid off,
