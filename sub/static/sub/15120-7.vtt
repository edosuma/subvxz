00:03.160 --> 00:06.479
Perhaps Stephen Turner can help.
I found a report with
Horst Goebel's name

00:06.480 --> 00:09.359
about the Khyber Dam. I saw
another name - Arthur Hill.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.999
Thank you for trusting me, Dr Hill.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.399
Hundreds were killed
and I'm responsible.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.640
I'm the bloody patsy.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.879
You're the mole.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.639
I didn't have a choice.
I couldn't tell you.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.600
What about Byzantium?
I cleaned that up too.

00:25.601 --> 00:27.839
You're innocent.

00:27.840 --> 00:32.598
Until now, Natalie Thorp was the
only person who knew I'd lied about
my identity. Now you know it too.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.239
Horst Goebel. His body was found
floating in the Keizersgracht canal.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.239
Whoever he was, I believe he
murdered Goebel then took his place.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.479
I spent the past year
searching for you.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.479
I need to take you somewhere safe,
beyond their reach.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.520
You mean Hourglass.

00:45.521 --> 00:48.239
You treat that with respect.
It's my future in there.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.559
I need to know what's in that case
that Horst Goebel gave to Turner.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.519
That woman you have
working in your house.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.000
She's not who you think she is.

00:56.001 --> 00:58.560
I've been here before.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:15.240 --> 02:16.638
You sure this is safe, Dr Goebel?

02:16.639 --> 02:18.080
We'll find out, won't we?

02:28.880 --> 02:29.960
Go slow.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.639
My God.

02:39.640 --> 02:42.480
Don't look, don't look.
Noura, don't look.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.840
Stop.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.639
This is where she saw them, right?

03:20.640 --> 03:21.680
HE QUESTIONS HER

03:23.920 --> 03:27.240
They went out in two boats,
with cylinders in the back.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.120
Doctor, what's in the case?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.800
Evidence.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.320
SCREAMING ECHOES

08:12.800 --> 08:14.680
Is this your blood?

08:23.040 --> 08:25.279
Natalie Thorpe's communiques.

08:25.280 --> 08:28.600
All the intel
I sent her about you in Tangier.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.400
How did Hector Stokes get these?
That's what I need you to find out.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.558
He must have sent the hit men
to Cafe Kalil.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.359
He might have.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.760
And you still have no idea why.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.400
What is it?

08:49.920 --> 08:53.239
There was something else
in his files.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.800
A police report from 1986.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.880
About what?

09:00.720 --> 09:03.639
The murder of Katherine Morton.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.800
Who's Katherine Morton?

09:06.280 --> 09:07.680
She was my mother.

09:12.640 --> 09:16.280
She was killed at a petrol station
when I was 11.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.560
Then they took me away.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.079
To the oast houses.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.800
And you don't know why?

09:31.360 --> 09:36.359
If this connects to who killed
your mother and kidnapped you,

09:36.360 --> 09:39.920
why would they come looking for you
now, after all these years?

09:42.600 --> 09:45.159
You must know something, Sam.

09:45.160 --> 09:49.600
Something that threatens Stokes,
his corporation...

09:51.040 --> 09:54.239
..maybe even Hourglass itself.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.720
I told you, I don't know.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.920
KNOCKING ON DOOR

10:12.080 --> 10:14.559
Come in.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.479
You asked me to monitor
the offices of Polyhedrus

10:17.480 --> 10:19.160
for anything relating to Sam Hunter.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.599
Did you find something?

10:20.600 --> 10:24.000
Not at their offices, no.
But we just intercepted this.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.359
Where was this taken?

10:29.360 --> 10:33.720
At the country estate of their CEO,
Hector Stokes.

10:40.120 --> 10:44.279
PHONE RINGING

10:44.280 --> 10:45.919
Pronto.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.880
'It's Hector Stokes. Where are you?'

10:47.881 --> 10:49.919
'In Rome.'

10:49.920 --> 10:51.519
I need you here, now.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.319
There's a problem.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.520
I'll be on the next plane.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.399
'The news at seven o'clock.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.759
'Police are this morning continuing
to investigate the fatal shooting

11:08.760 --> 11:11.599
'of a prominent
engineer at a hotel in London.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.480
'Dr Arthur Hill was in a meeting
room at the Brensham Hotel...'

11:31.240 --> 11:35.640
'..The controversial
Pakistani presidential candidate...'

11:50.800 --> 11:52.080
Alex.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.720
Alex?

12:00.880 --> 12:02.960
Eddie...

12:05.800 --> 12:08.759
Mrs Sidwa, have you seen
Alex and Eddie?

12:08.760 --> 12:11.040
They left early. I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.279
Is that him?

12:18.280 --> 12:19.640
It's him.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.039
Eddie, he's beautiful.
Can I feed him?

12:31.040 --> 12:32.360
You have to know the trick.

12:32.361 --> 12:33.600
What trick?

12:40.360 --> 12:43.720
Hold your hand out flat
so he doesn't bite you by accident.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.040
Try?

12:50.040 --> 12:52.040
It tickles!

12:54.880 --> 12:56.119
Good boy.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.519
How often did you come here?

12:58.520 --> 13:00.320
Every week.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.719
You're a brave man, Eddie.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.239
Your mother would've been happy
that you came here.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.200
You never met her.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.359
No.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.400
Then how would you know
what she wanted?

13:20.880 --> 13:22.799
I know she loved you very much,

13:22.800 --> 13:25.479
and that she'd want you
to be with the people

13:25.480 --> 13:27.200
and do the things you love.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.959
Morning, you two.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.199
Morning, Dad.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.319
Morning.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.039
Alex, can I have a word?

13:39.040 --> 13:41.000
Sure.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.759
You should've told me you were
doing this.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.999
I'm sorry, I could see
he wanted to come.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.719
You're just dredging up memories.
It's his birthday tomorrow.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.200
What is it? What's bothering you?
Explain this.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.720
My fingerprints...

14:07.721 --> 14:09.199
The police found them.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.039
Where?

14:11.040 --> 14:13.399
There was a break-in
at Lewis' office

14:13.400 --> 14:14.920
the night before he was murdered.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.839
How did you get these?

14:17.840 --> 14:19.280
They're yours, aren't they?

14:19.281 --> 14:21.639
Are you spying on me?
What were you doing there?

14:21.640 --> 14:23.399
Are you accusing me of something?

14:23.400 --> 14:24.880
Just answer the question!

14:25.920 --> 14:28.359
Lewis took me there that night.
He took you?

14:28.360 --> 14:31.119
He said he had urgent business,
something to do with your father.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.319
Goncourt, or something?

14:33.320 --> 14:34.359
Goncourt...

14:34.360 --> 14:37.600
I would expect this
from your father. Not from you.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.920
I'm sorry.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.960
I guess I'm getting
as paranoid as my dad.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.799
What is it? What happened?

14:51.800 --> 14:55.599
I think my father had something
to do with Lewis' death.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.480
I thought he killed himself.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.200
I don't think so.
I don't mean to scare you.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.479
Although I am scared to death...

15:04.480 --> 15:06.279
What are you going to do?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.840
Leave. With Eddie.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.999
When?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.519
Tonight.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.160
Come with us.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.759
'Hey, Lee Harvey Oswald.'

15:30.760 --> 15:32.559
Ha. You're a comedian now

15:32.560 --> 15:36.679
Jack Turner's leaving the house.
Yeah, no shit.
Get your butt in gear... killer.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.640
Tears of laughter, really

16:04.040 --> 16:06.519
Jack's got a little
rendezvous going.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.879
We're going to want to hear this.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.200
Thought you might.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.919
I used to unload ships down here,
a long time ago.

16:27.920 --> 16:33.119
24-hour shifts. Real work, that was.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.999
Made your hands raw.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.399
Not like the bankers
I sold the land onto.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.279
Men with soft hands.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.159
Men like me.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.360
Come to think of it...

16:45.361 --> 16:48.999
Men like you have made a lot of
money off the backs of men like me.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.959
'You seem to have
done just fine, Mr Turner.'

16:51.960 --> 16:55.000
'I've fought
and scraped for every penny.'

16:57.880 --> 16:59.759
I don't have an army of lawyers...

16:59.760 --> 17:01.560
Thought I recognised him.
Who is it?

17:01.561 --> 17:03.479
That Pakistani minister. Soomro.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.839
'I hope you don't expect pity.'

17:05.839 --> 17:08.759
No, not pity.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.919
Respect.

17:10.920 --> 17:14.239
You've disappointed me, Mr Turner.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.878
'I've disappointed you?! The terms of
our deal were not met.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.719
'Madam Zahir is alive and well.'

17:19.720 --> 17:22.040
Yeah we took care of that whistle
blower she met with...

17:22.040 --> 17:23.638
that was the main bit.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.239
Hold on, he knocked off Hill
for Soomro? Shut up and listen.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.999
'I've been through hoops for you,
Mr Soomro.'

17:29.000 --> 17:31.319
Raising our bid to
a billion pounds,

17:31.320 --> 17:33.279
bumping off your whistle blower...

17:33.280 --> 17:35.719
and you just keep moving
the goal posts.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.959
The government of Pakistan has
decided to award

17:38.960 --> 17:41.120
the Khyber Dam to the Chinese.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.279
At last. Hallelujah.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.319
Shut up!

17:45.320 --> 17:48.319
Turner's lost the bid.
We've won, haven't we?

17:48.320 --> 17:50.959
The "government has awarded
the contract".

17:50.960 --> 17:53.360
You mean you.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.560
And you've been bought
and paid for by Polyhedrus.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.359
Polyhedrus?

18:02.360 --> 18:05.239
You're confused, Mr Turner.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.959
Polyhedrus hasn't bid on the dam.
Polyhedrus built the dam

18:07.960 --> 18:09.439
for your government.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.959
Might upset people if they knew you
were selling it back to them.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.519
For less than you paid them
to build it. I told you,

18:15.520 --> 18:19.919
the Chinese have been awarded the
contract. Well, of course they have.
As a front for Polyhedrus.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.879
Who want to control the water
supply in Central Asia.
That's no secret.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.280
These are conspiracy theories.

18:25.281 --> 18:28.079
You call them what you like.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.640
Goodbye, Mr Turner.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.839
Mr Soomro, you think I didn't see
the double-cross coming?

18:35.840 --> 18:38.599
I know what your whistle blower
was going to say.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.040
So what if you do? Dr Hill is dead.

18:40.041 --> 18:44.160
I've got something he didn't have.
Proof.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.919
Proof?

18:48.920 --> 18:52.400
Of what Polyhedrus did
to get that dam built.

18:55.160 --> 18:59.040
If word got out,
their shares would tumble.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.640
Cost them tens of billions,
markets the way they are.

19:05.680 --> 19:09.599
You tell your masters what I said.
Then you come back

19:09.600 --> 19:11.639
with the contract for me to sign.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.999
It's taken longer than we thought,

19:14.000 --> 19:18.199
but Jack Turner's finally
shown his hand. And it's blackmail.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.319
Against?

19:19.320 --> 19:20.559
Polyhedrus.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.599
Polyhedrus is one of the largest
corporations in the world.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.319
Annual revenues of 150 billion
dollars.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.959
Nearly 200,000 employees worldwide.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.800
Holdings in coal,
construction, water

19:30.801 --> 19:33.839
and raw materials from Sierra Leone
to Afghanistan.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.079
Hector Stokes.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.199
Yeah, the CEO of Polyhedrus.
Sits on the board of Byzantium.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.519
That's right.

19:39.520 --> 19:42.679
So the Chinese bidder
isn't our client.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.840
It's Polyhedrus - Hector Stokes?

19:46.160 --> 19:48.879
I mean, can't help drawing
conclusions, can I?

19:48.880 --> 19:50.999
Try not to, Mr Fowkes.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.239
Turner claims that Polyhedrus is
using the Chinese as a front,

19:55.240 --> 19:58.119
buying the dam on its behalf.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.999
He says he has evidence that
will stop the sale.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.199
But we don't know what it is.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.079
No, but we have a fair
idea where is it.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.159
In that case that he gave
Dave Ryder.

20:09.160 --> 20:14.319
That bloody case. The curse of my
life. You need to find it.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.079
It's not at the club, not any more.
I can tell you that much.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.639
Dave Ryder's your mate. Just get him
to take you where it is.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.440
I can't very well go see him now,
can I?

20:21.441 --> 20:24.199
Not with Mr T and half the police
out looking for me.

20:24.200 --> 20:29.519
That's exactly why you need to see
him. Turn that to your advantage.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.999
How you getting on with
Stephen Turner, Sam?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.518
Jack keeps him out of his meetings.

20:33.519 --> 20:35.560
I doubt if he knows
anything about the black case.

20:35.561 --> 20:40.319
No. But he writes the cheques
for JTRP Holdings, doesn't he?
I had Zoe check,

20:40.320 --> 20:42.200
nothing's been
paid into Goebel's account.

20:42.201 --> 20:47.320
Which is strange, if the contents
of that case is so valuable.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.599
Our client's Hector Stokes. We've
been working for the man who wants
you dead.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.719
Ballard warned me as much.
Keel doesn't know.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.239
It's only a matter of time
before he finds out.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.879
I need a plant in today's newspaper
about the death of Horst Goebel.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.679
The drowning of a Dutch water
engineer's not very big news.

21:03.680 --> 21:07.559
Put it in Metro, page 22.
Ironic headline. No pictures.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.360
Suggest foul play,
about his trip to London.

21:09.361 --> 21:12.200
Right. How quickly do you need it?
Right away. OK.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.239
When you were a child, you must have
seen or heard something that

21:17.240 --> 21:19.560
explains Stokes' interest in you.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.239
Whatever you know,
it must threaten him, Sam.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.959
Which means it's leverage
we can use to keep you alive.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.519
If you can remember?

21:27.520 --> 21:30.080
I told you. I... can't.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.119
I know this is hard.

21:33.120 --> 21:37.880
But you need to remember what you
saw. Before it's too late.

21:52.200 --> 21:58.279
Sam Hunter... In my house.
One guard injured, one dead.

21:58.280 --> 22:01.399
I'm supposed to be hunting her,
not the other way round.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.799
Do you think Keel knows?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.720
No, and I'd like to keep it that way.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.279
He's handling a rather important
case for us just now.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.399
A case in which Sam Hunter is
the prime operative.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.839
Which complicates our task
considerably.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.240
And what task is that, Hector?

22:19.640 --> 22:21.759
Terminating her, of course.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.319
I know you, Hector.

22:23.320 --> 22:26.960
You wouldn't be calling me
if there weren't more to it.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.000
There is this...

22:38.720 --> 22:39.918
Who's paying him?

22:39.919 --> 22:41.598
I couldn't tell you even if I knew.

22:41.599 --> 22:43.000
He's already approached her.

22:43.001 --> 22:46.359
Undoubtedly,
he claims to be her protector.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.400
What makes you think that?

22:47.401 --> 22:51.840
We believe he took out our man with
a sniper shot a couple days ago.

22:53.800 --> 22:59.840
I need information. Everyone
on Sam Hunter's team at Byzantium.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.719
I believe this is yours.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.959
Blood?

23:29.960 --> 23:31.319
It's Sam's.

23:31.320 --> 23:34.760
Take that.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.440
What's that stain?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.000
You don't recognise it?

23:43.400 --> 23:46.599
We need to know who gave these
to Hector Stokes.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.159
Sam found them at his estate.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.240
Ballard said that only he
and the Minister saw these.

23:50.241 --> 23:55.039
Obviously not. I'd say Byzantium's
not the only one with a mole.

23:55.040 --> 23:59.199
You're jumping to conclusions.
Let me find out how this happened.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.359
Well, I'd be very careful
if I were you.

24:01.360 --> 24:05.999
You're in a rather melodramatic
mood today, aren't you? Am I?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.999
Sam was nearly killed,
and Ballard's dead.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.799
You think they'd hesitate to
kill you, too?

24:12.800 --> 24:16.359
I'm surprised she trusted you
enough to bring you these.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.160
After she found out you lied to her.

24:18.161 --> 24:22.159
I've told her I'm not who
I said I am.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.920
But you didn't tell her who
you really are.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.680
And when she finds out?

24:46.040 --> 24:47.520
KNOCK AT DOOR

24:49.960 --> 24:52.159
Can I talk to you for a second?

24:52.160 --> 24:54.080
Sure.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.399
Have you seen this?

25:01.400 --> 25:05.159
That's the man that came here
the day I arrived, isn't it?

25:05.160 --> 25:07.239
Yeah. Horst Goebel.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.480
It says he died three weeks ago.
Right after he left here.

25:09.481 --> 25:11.479
That can't be a coincidence.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.560
They might think you had
something to do with it.

25:13.561 --> 25:17.359
I doubt it. I didn't really have
anything to do with my father's
business with Dr Goebel.

25:17.360 --> 25:21.760
He just had me pay him,
and Dr Goebel refused even that.

25:22.760 --> 25:23.959
He refused...?

25:23.960 --> 25:27.680
He had all his money sent to
a trust, the Asia Promise Society.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.159
I never thanked you for this
morning.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.239
That was a big moment for Eddie,
going back to those stables.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.960
You don't need to thank me.
Yeah, I do.

25:39.040 --> 25:42.280
I'm doing something now
I should've done a long time ago.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.200
It's because of you.

27:03.280 --> 27:07.679
Mr Turner. We're going to have to
stop meeting like this.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.439
I just wanted to thank you for those
fingerprints you gave me last night.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.879
That was very helpful.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.560
Happy to oblige.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.839
I'm wondering what other
services you can offer.

27:19.840 --> 27:20.880
Services?

27:22.160 --> 27:25.239
Besides the information you
give my father, are you able to...

27:25.240 --> 27:27.199
take certain actions?

27:27.200 --> 27:32.919
You're being vague, Mr Turner.
Whatever it is, just say it.

27:32.920 --> 27:35.320
My father...
I'm sure he's asked you to...

27:38.040 --> 27:39.440
..take care of people.

27:41.680 --> 27:42.879
I see.

27:42.880 --> 27:46.279
If there was somebody that I need
taken care of...

27:46.280 --> 27:48.799
I don't "take care of people".

27:48.800 --> 27:51.279
You don't...
I thought that Lewis Conroy...

27:51.280 --> 27:57.360
No. Jack gives orders to Bingham.
Bingham gives orders to Dave Ryder.

27:58.360 --> 28:03.560
And Dave Ryder... Well, Dave...
has a lot of lads hanging about.

28:05.080 --> 28:06.439
So it was one of them.

28:06.440 --> 28:10.120
Yeah, a bloke in a hoodie.

28:11.160 --> 28:15.759
I don't recommend you try hiring him
yourself.

28:15.760 --> 28:23.119
Look, if you get rid of someone,
you tell me.

28:23.120 --> 28:27.879
And for a price, I can help...
steer the investigation.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.599
Like you did with Lewis.
Getting it ruled a murder-suicide.

28:30.600 --> 28:35.839
That's right.
He was your friend, wasn't he?

28:35.840 --> 28:36.960
I'm sorry about that.

28:36.961 --> 28:38.480
Don't touch me.

28:42.520 --> 28:45.120
Bastard.

28:55.320 --> 28:59.119
'Jack gives orders to Bingham.
Bingham gives orders to Dave Ryder.

28:59.120 --> 29:03.400
'And Dave Ryder... Well, Dave...
has a lot of lads hanging about.'

29:15.160 --> 29:16.959
Be careful, yeah.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.039
Am I hearing genuine
concern for my well being?

29:19.040 --> 29:22.319
No, I just don't want you to screw
this up for the rest of us.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.999
Now what makes you think
I'd do that?

29:25.000 --> 29:28.360
Let's just say your reputation
in the Forces precedes you.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.600
My temper got the best of me... once.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.880
I came here to make a fresh start,
you understand?

29:42.080 --> 29:45.720
Beat it then.
Yeah. OK.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.239
MOBILE RINGS

29:51.240 --> 29:53.079
Andrew? You busy?

29:53.080 --> 29:55.959
Yeah? Someone's here to see you,
says she is an old friend.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.120
What did she say?

29:57.121 --> 30:00.799
Nothing, just that she really
wants to see you.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.880
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right there.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.520
Surprised to see me?

30:17.000 --> 30:18.840
You can't be coming in here.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.319
Have you got a death-wish or
something?

30:23.320 --> 30:26.719
Where am I supposed to go? Cops are
swarming all over the place.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.319
What the hell happened yesterday?

30:28.320 --> 30:30.999
Your mate Tyrone set me up,
that's what happened.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.239
Shot some bloke through a window,
then planted the evidence on me.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.359
That's why they shut me out then.

30:36.360 --> 30:39.159
They knew I wouldn't stand for it.
You've got to let me stay here.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.199
He's been here twice
looking for you already.

30:41.200 --> 30:45.680
Then take me to your place. My
place? They won't look for me there.

30:47.400 --> 30:48.880
You got me into this.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.119
Andrew?

30:55.120 --> 31:00.119
Zoe. There you are. We've been
having a lovely chat, haven't we?

31:00.120 --> 31:03.759
Zoe, great to see you again.
How long has it been?
Eight years, nine?

31:03.760 --> 31:05.559
At least, yeah.

31:05.560 --> 31:08.319
I've just been telling Andrew
about our Grade II-listed Georgian

31:08.320 --> 31:10.519
we're wanting to restore. Georgian.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.999
Andrew's speciality.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.719
Isn't that a coincidence?
I've just been showing her my work.

31:15.720 --> 31:17.920
I'll have to talk to Craig,
but I think you would be
perfect for the job.

31:17.921 --> 31:20.159
I have some drawings
and photographs

31:20.160 --> 31:24.080
from my last restoration.
I'd love to see them, thank you.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.399
Who the frick are you?

31:37.400 --> 31:41.119
I needed to draw you
away from Byzantium.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.039
You haven't answered my question.

31:43.040 --> 31:47.440
I'm a private security contractor,
just like you, Miss Morgan.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.560
You came to my home.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.120
My home!

31:56.320 --> 31:58.200
I'm here to help a friend of yours.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.640
Sam Hunter.

32:05.680 --> 32:06.720
Let's take a walk.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.919
I'm sure you've been asking
yourself questions,

32:10.920 --> 32:14.119
everyone on your team has.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.879
About?

32:15.880 --> 32:18.599
Sam disappears after your op
in Tangier last year,

32:18.600 --> 32:21.399
then suddenly resurfaces,
without explanation.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.319
I suppose you know what happened.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.679
She was shot.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.840
At a cafe in Tangier,
while waiting to meet Aidan Marsh.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.079
Did he set her up?

32:31.080 --> 32:33.520
She wasn't sure who set her up.
Which is why she returned,

32:33.521 --> 32:35.559
but didn't tell anyone what
had happened.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.959
She didn't feel
she could trust any of you.

32:37.960 --> 32:40.119
If that's true,
I can't say I blame her.

32:40.120 --> 32:45.560
The op you're on is about to end
and, when it does, she'll be
persuaded to go away with this man.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.600
Do you recognise him?

32:49.600 --> 32:51.719
He wants her to believe he's
going to help her.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.559
But if she goes with him,
she'll never come back.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.839
Why hasn't he killed her already?

32:56.840 --> 32:58.839
He needs something from her first.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.759
Whereas you...? Well, I'd be lying
if I was to tell you

33:01.760 --> 33:03.960
the motives
of my employer were benign.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.160
What is it you want from me?

33:08.320 --> 33:09.760
This man is watching her.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.919
I need you to bring Sam to me.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.919
So I can talk to her without him
knowing.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.120
You want me to lie to Sam.

33:16.121 --> 33:17.479
So I can help her, yes.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.279
And how are you going to do that?

33:19.280 --> 33:22.879
By giving her answers about who's
trying to kill her and why.

33:22.880 --> 33:26.120
Giving her the chance to live
the rest of her life without
looking over her shoulder.

33:27.320 --> 33:28.560
I'll be in touch.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.919
Miss Thorpe, come in. Come in.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.119
Good afternoon, Under Secretary.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.879
Do sit down.

33:44.880 --> 33:50.479
I've just been reading
about your rather impressive career.
Have you? Whatever for?

33:50.480 --> 33:52.679
You're in line
for George Ballard's job.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.759
Sad circumstances, of course,

33:54.760 --> 33:57.160
but I'd say you have an excellent
chance of getting it.

33:57.161 --> 33:58.839
Thank you, sir.

33:58.840 --> 34:00.200
Now what can I do for you?

34:00.201 --> 34:04.039
I'd appreciate it if you told no-one
in your office about this.

34:04.040 --> 34:08.199
Very well. What is it?
These are classified communiques
I sent to George Ballard last year.

34:08.199 --> 34:11.319
Based on intel supplied by a mole
inside Byzantium.

34:11.320 --> 34:14.199
I believe this information was used
to target a Byzantium

34:14.199 --> 34:17.320
operative for assassination.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.679
Assassination? By whom?

34:20.679 --> 34:24.279
These reports were found in files
belonging to Hector Stokes.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.280
The CEO of Polyhedrus?

34:27.840 --> 34:30.679
Do you have any idea how
he might have got these?

34:31.920 --> 34:36.280
Those communiques only went to
Ballard and this Ministry.

34:38.719 --> 34:41.759
Do you think the Minister or
someone in this office passed them

34:41.760 --> 34:44.199
on to Stokes?

34:44.199 --> 34:45.438
It's possible.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.958
That's a very distressing thought.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.478
It gets more distressing, sir.

34:50.480 --> 34:53.199
George was looking into a conspiracy
when he was murdered.

34:53.199 --> 34:55.080
Something called Hourglass.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.960
I'm afraid you'll have to
enlighten me.

34:57.961 --> 35:03.079
The CEOs of five major corporations
colluding to concentrate power
and wealth into their own hands.

35:03.080 --> 35:05.439
And he believed Hector Stokes
was one of them.

35:05.440 --> 35:09.199
Sounds like George must've
been spending too much time
on the Internet.

35:09.200 --> 35:13.159
You've been investigating his death.

35:13.160 --> 35:16.920
You've found nothing linking back to
any of this? No. Of course not.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.759
I really should be going.

35:23.760 --> 35:28.119
Miss Thorpe... I think it best
we keep this to ourselves.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.920
Tell no-one of your suspicions.

35:32.120 --> 35:35.400
Of course, sir.
And thank you for your time.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.239
Home sweet home. Such as it is.

36:03.240 --> 36:04.519
Fancy a drink?

36:04.520 --> 36:05.800
Sure. Why not?

36:21.560 --> 36:22.960
How long you been here then?

36:22.961 --> 36:26.199
Ten, twelve years.
Since the missus up and left.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.319
Sorry to hear that.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.439
She never had much use for me,
anyway.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.479
This your daughter?

36:33.480 --> 36:35.920
Yeah, Susan. She's all grown now.
You see her much?

36:35.921 --> 36:38.680
Nah. Suppose she doesn't have much
use for me neither.

36:40.280 --> 36:41.919
Cheers.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.839
Right, I better get back.

36:43.840 --> 36:47.520
Don't open that door for no-one
but me, understand? OK. Got it.

37:01.280 --> 37:03.239
Anything?

37:03.240 --> 37:04.720
It's just as Stephen said.

37:04.721 --> 37:07.639
Goebel had his fee transferred to
the Asia Promise Society.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.199
Two million pounds.

37:09.200 --> 37:12.039
Dr Goebel seems an unlikely
Samaritan.

37:12.040 --> 37:15.479
Most of the funds were earmarked
for a Pakistani refugee centre in
London.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.519
I don't understand the connection.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.039
Neither did we.

37:19.040 --> 37:22.000
Until Simran discovered
he visited the centre six
times in the past year.

37:22.001 --> 37:23.359
What for?

37:23.360 --> 37:25.000
He was sponsoring
the care of a refugee,

37:25.001 --> 37:28.000
a 16-year-old girl called
Noura Khatami from Gedawar.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.440
Sam...

37:34.000 --> 37:35.400
..I'm sorry.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.639
You're sorry? You trusted me.

37:41.640 --> 37:47.000
Until last night, I didn't realise
how hard that must've been for you.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.120
That trust nearly got you killed.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.440
And cost us our child.

37:54.520 --> 37:59.000
What is it you want? Forgiveness?

38:00.720 --> 38:04.119
Because now you think you
"understand"?

38:04.120 --> 38:05.240
I don't forgive you.

38:07.680 --> 38:10.199
And you don't understand me.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.120
My mistake was
thinking for a moment you could.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.680
Noura? I'm sorry,
they said I could let myself in.

39:02.681 --> 39:05.840
I'm a friend of Dr Goebel's.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.400
Did someone kill him?

39:11.560 --> 39:14.639
I'm afraid so.

39:14.640 --> 39:17.879
I knew something had happened.
When I didn't hear from him.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.680
He brought you here from Pakistan?

39:23.680 --> 39:25.080
You're not a friend of his, are you?

39:27.600 --> 39:29.759
No. I'm not.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.079
Do you work for them? Who?

39:32.080 --> 39:34.480
The men who built that dam.

39:35.880 --> 39:37.720
Who did this to my face.

39:41.200 --> 39:42.319
What happened?

39:42.320 --> 39:44.319
They came to my village. With gas.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.559
They killed everyone.

39:46.560 --> 39:49.680
Why? So they could open the dam,
of course.

39:50.840 --> 39:55.839
I showed Dr Goebel where to get
the proof from the lake, the mud.

39:55.840 --> 39:59.719
But the men from the dam,
they found out.

39:59.720 --> 40:05.000
And they burned my face.
So that I wouldn't tell anyone else.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.000
I'm so sorry.

40:11.720 --> 40:14.279
The proof he collected.
Do you know where it is?

40:14.280 --> 40:17.120
It was in a case. A black case.

40:40.280 --> 40:43.760
Yes! Thank you!

40:49.080 --> 40:50.919
Sorry.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.640
It's all right, Gary.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.759
You're still a good bloke.

40:55.760 --> 40:58.440
GUNSHOT

41:09.440 --> 41:11.320
Get back! Get back!

41:53.400 --> 41:56.960
SCREAMING

42:11.480 --> 42:13.840
This is where the Upper Khyber Dam
was constructed.

42:13.841 --> 42:15.799
At the mouth of the Gedawar River.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.439
Polyhedrus intended to dam
seven billion gallons of water,

42:18.440 --> 42:20.279
flooding 80 square miles.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.999
Only one small problem.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.479
The ancient village of Gedawar

42:24.480 --> 42:26.519
sat right in the middle
of the flood plain.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.399
Noura's village.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.119
Yeah. The residents had
no desire to leave their homes.

42:31.120 --> 42:33.639
They were increasingly
vocal about it, in fact,

42:33.640 --> 42:35.199
and they were gaining support.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.839
And then, four months before
the dam was due to open,

42:37.840 --> 42:41.279
what was described as a natural
disaster struck Gedawar.

42:41.280 --> 42:44.359
Seismic activity
in the Gedawar lake

42:44.360 --> 42:47.879
caused the release of a cloud of
hydrogen sulphide gas.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.520
It's highly toxic.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.880
Nearly all of the 600 inhabitants
were killed in minutes.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.680
Polyhedrus' own consultants,
Drs Hill and Goebel,

43:09.681 --> 43:12.679
determined the gas release was
a freak occurrence

43:12.680 --> 43:15.759
posing no threat whatsoever to
the integrity of the dam,

43:15.760 --> 43:18.560
which subsequently opened a
month ahead of schedule.

43:27.920 --> 43:31.359
This is what Dr Hill was going
to blow the whistle on.

43:31.360 --> 43:34.559
Or what Goebel intended to expose
until Jack Turner got to him first.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.799
And the "mud" that Noura
told Sam he collected

43:36.800 --> 43:39.959
must have been sediment samples,
proving that the hydrogen sulphide

43:39.960 --> 43:42.680
couldn't have come from the
bottom of that lake.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.240
Polyhedrus exterminated 600 people.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.960
We're working for a mass murderer.

43:59.960 --> 44:02.840
We don't draw conclusions.
We execute orders.

44:04.640 --> 44:08.040
You want your case? Here's your case!

44:46.200 --> 44:50.360
Hi, I'm Stephen Turner. I've got an
appointment with Commander Brooke.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.560
You wanted to see me?

45:15.440 --> 45:16.959
You should've come to me, Sam.

45:16.960 --> 45:21.280
Instead of getting Aidan
to cover for you.

45:22.680 --> 45:29.079
Our client wants you dead. That's
why you disappeared last year.

45:29.080 --> 45:34.440
And why you broke into his estate
last night.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.479
How much do you know?

45:39.480 --> 45:43.160
You came back to Byzantium to find
out who tried to kill you and why.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.000
You didn't trust me, of course.

45:50.960 --> 45:52.559
I still don't.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.440
I got you released from Polyhedrus.

45:54.441 --> 45:57.199
If Stokes found out you were
there you might be dead already.

45:57.200 --> 46:00.560
So you're helping me now,
is that it?

46:04.200 --> 46:05.920
So, what are you going to do?

46:07.040 --> 46:10.800
Nothing, until the op is over.

46:11.800 --> 46:14.119
And then you'll just hand me
to Stokes.

46:14.120 --> 46:16.639
What makes you say that?

46:16.640 --> 46:20.159
Well, it's nothing personal,
and you may even be sad,

46:20.160 --> 46:22.920
given my value to you and our
relationship, such as it is.

46:24.680 --> 46:28.079
But as much as you don't like being
kept in the dark, you said it...

46:28.080 --> 46:30.839
you "execute orders", Mr Keel.

46:30.840 --> 46:32.840
It's not your decision to make.

46:35.640 --> 46:38.599
I'd suggest you don't try
and run away again.

46:38.600 --> 46:41.879
How did you know
they tried to kill me?

46:41.880 --> 46:44.279
I located your medical reports

46:44.280 --> 46:47.759
from the hospital you checked
into under an assumed name.

46:47.760 --> 46:49.799
In Istanbul.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.880
I know, Sam.

47:07.680 --> 47:08.960
Miss Hunter.

47:10.800 --> 47:12.080
What are you doing here?

47:12.081 --> 47:14.319
I needed to see you. For what?

47:14.320 --> 47:17.759
Those communiques you found
were passed onto Hector Stokes
by Edward Gillespie.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.679
Who's he?

47:19.680 --> 47:22.319
The under-secretary
for the Ministry of Defence.

47:22.320 --> 47:23.959
Ballard didn't know, obviously.

47:23.960 --> 47:26.479
You're in great danger. We both are.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.439
Why come to me and not Aidan?

47:28.440 --> 47:29.999
He told you about him and me?

47:30.000 --> 47:32.600
He has. But he hasn't told you
who he really is.

47:34.880 --> 47:36.239
No.

47:36.240 --> 47:39.359
I think you should know - before you
decide whether to trust him again.

47:39.360 --> 47:42.200
This opens a safe deposit
box in Tottenham Court Road.

47:45.520 --> 47:47.440
His MI6 file's inside.

48:13.560 --> 48:14.840
You OK?

48:16.200 --> 48:17.480
What is it?

48:19.480 --> 48:21.439
Dave Ryder.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.480
I keep seeing the look on his face.

48:28.480 --> 48:31.239
Yeah, I know. It's hard.

48:31.240 --> 48:34.160
Betraying someone who trusts you?
Bloody miserable.

48:36.280 --> 48:39.040
And all for a box of rocks?

48:42.200 --> 48:45.919
Deacon? That girl told Sam the case
contained sediment samples, right?

48:45.920 --> 48:46.959
Right.

48:46.960 --> 48:49.199
Proving Polyhedrus poisoned
those villagers.

48:49.200 --> 48:53.399
Well, it didn't, did it? Unless that
Horst Goebel impersonator took them.

48:53.400 --> 48:57.039
I think Jack Turner would've noticed
if he took receipt of a bunch
of rocks.

48:57.040 --> 48:58.959
Then where'd those samples go?

48:58.960 --> 49:00.200
Nowhere. Take a look.

49:00.201 --> 49:03.279
This is the night Jack
takes possession of the case.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.679
He stows it here.

49:04.680 --> 49:06.040
That's the case he gave Dave.

49:06.041 --> 49:07.479
Is it?

49:07.480 --> 49:09.239
This is footage from the next day,

49:09.240 --> 49:11.359
when he gives the case
to Dave Ryder.

49:11.360 --> 49:13.040
Wait a minute.
How'd it get over there?

49:13.041 --> 49:17.159
It didn't. Turner gave him a decoy.
The real case never left that room.
It's still in the library.

49:17.160 --> 49:19.079
Son of a bitch!

49:19.080 --> 49:21.199
I've been waiting for an hour.

49:21.200 --> 49:24.480
Yes, Mr Turner. I just got the call.
I'll take you back now.

49:46.560 --> 49:49.959
Call yourself a son?
Call yourself my son?

49:49.960 --> 49:51.319
Betray your own father?

49:51.320 --> 49:53.319
You had Lewis murdered
and I can prove it!

49:53.320 --> 49:56.160
Who's listening?
You treacherous little shit..!

49:57.520 --> 50:00.679
You want to call the police?

50:00.680 --> 50:02.759
Your answer for everything!

50:02.760 --> 50:06.719
Whatever you think I've done,
you don't betray your own blood.

50:06.720 --> 50:08.519
He was my friend!

50:08.520 --> 50:10.679
Lewis? Good friend, was he?

50:10.680 --> 50:12.598
He was knobbing your wife,
I know that.

50:12.599 --> 50:13.880
You're disgusting.

50:13.881 --> 50:18.159
I reckon the guilt was too much for
her. That's why she offed herself.

50:18.160 --> 50:20.920
Eddie and I are leaving.

50:22.720 --> 50:24.759
You taking the tart with you?

50:24.760 --> 50:28.040
Careful, son.
You don't like violence.

50:31.120 --> 50:32.479
She is a tart, you know.

50:32.480 --> 50:35.799
Say that again
and I will break your neck!

50:35.800 --> 50:37.680
She's being paid to screw you.

50:39.480 --> 50:41.280
She is screwing you, isn't she?

50:42.680 --> 50:46.999
You turn everything to filth.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.759
She's a plant.

50:48.760 --> 50:50.240
A professional.

50:51.760 --> 50:53.199
Eddie's kidnap...

50:53.200 --> 50:56.679
she staged it with that bloody bag
of shit we had down in the basement.

50:56.680 --> 50:59.159
To win your trust. You're lying.

50:59.160 --> 51:00.839
I wish I was.

51:00.840 --> 51:03.359
We know about the fingerprints,
Stevie.

51:03.360 --> 51:05.399
Bingham found cameras in
the library.

51:05.400 --> 51:08.199
Who do you think put them there?

51:08.200 --> 51:09.639
Mmm?

51:09.640 --> 51:12.359
I know this hurts.

51:12.360 --> 51:14.080
But you're still my son.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.920
You're still my family.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.239
These are powerful people
we're up against.

51:21.240 --> 51:25.920
They will use anyone,
do anything, to destroy me.

51:33.320 --> 51:36.280
Alex was my mistake.

51:37.760 --> 51:39.599
I'll get her out of the house.

51:39.600 --> 51:41.119
That's the last thing you'll do.

51:41.120 --> 51:42.199
She's a spy.

51:42.200 --> 51:45.440
We don't want her employers
suspecting we suspect her.

51:46.920 --> 51:49.239
Just carry on as normal.

51:49.240 --> 51:52.880
When all this is over,
I'll deal with her.

51:55.280 --> 51:58.200
Whatever she's done,
you don't hurt her.

52:01.040 --> 52:04.280
I promise - I won't hurt her.

52:06.760 --> 52:09.440
Now come on, son. Let's go home.

52:26.640 --> 52:28.400
What happened to your face then?

52:31.160 --> 52:35.160
Would you care to explain
how Stephen Turner got hold of these?

52:43.400 --> 52:45.599
I was going to give 'em to you.

52:45.600 --> 52:46.959
He paid you, is that it?

52:46.960 --> 52:49.279
No. Course not.

52:49.280 --> 52:53.960
Do you expect to lie your way
out of this one, Inspector?

52:55.320 --> 52:58.959
You can't kill a cop, Mr Bingham.

52:58.960 --> 53:03.200
Not without getting into a whole
world of trouble.

54:04.600 --> 54:06.279
Rupert. Hector.

54:06.280 --> 54:12.000
These offices were built two years
ago at a cost of £120 million.

54:13.400 --> 54:15.119
We've yet to find a tenant.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.600
Difficult times.

54:17.800 --> 54:20.559
Well, Every Achilles has his heel.

54:20.560 --> 54:22.399
We can ill afford mistakes.

54:22.400 --> 54:24.279
Mistakes?

54:24.280 --> 54:28.599
I'm told Jack Turner has evidence
incriminating Polyhedrus.

54:28.600 --> 54:31.439
He'll go public
unless he's awarded the dam.

54:31.440 --> 54:34.799
No doubt he intends to go
public regardless.

54:34.800 --> 54:38.079
That evidence could bring down
this corporation.

54:38.080 --> 54:39.160
And me.

54:40.400 --> 54:42.719
Jack Turner's only just
shown his hand.

54:42.720 --> 54:45.439
It would've been helpful if you'd
told me about this before.

54:45.440 --> 54:47.279
I wasn't aware he knew, obviously.

54:47.280 --> 54:49.959
600 villagers killed to make way
for a dam.

54:49.960 --> 54:52.599
You might have guessed this would've
come out sooner or later.

54:52.600 --> 54:55.600
Polyhedrus is used to keeping
its secrets.

54:56.800 --> 54:59.759
In any case,
I've decided on a new course.

54:59.760 --> 55:01.399
Which course is that?

55:01.400 --> 55:03.440
Jack Turner is to be eliminated.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.279
At once.

55:06.280 --> 55:09.319
I'd advise against undue haste.

55:09.320 --> 55:12.879
I have a shareholders'
meeting in less than 48 hours.

55:12.880 --> 55:14.559
Just get rid of him, Rupert.

55:14.560 --> 55:16.639
And the evidence against you?

55:16.640 --> 55:18.359
Secure it. After he's dead.

55:18.360 --> 55:21.200
Any other reason you want this
concluded so quickly?

55:24.480 --> 55:26.040
Such as?

55:47.720 --> 55:49.759
Hey, Alex. Hey!

55:49.760 --> 55:52.079
I've almost finished your book.

55:52.080 --> 55:53.520
Are you enjoying it?

55:55.880 --> 55:57.359
How does it end?

55:57.360 --> 55:59.240
You don't want me to tell you that.

55:59.241 --> 56:01.160
I do. That would spoil it.

56:03.080 --> 56:05.080
I'm scared it's going to end sadly.

56:07.080 --> 56:08.960
Mr Turner.
There's tea in your office.

56:08.961 --> 56:10.799
Thanks, Mrs S.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.279
I'll be right back.

56:12.280 --> 56:13.880
OK.

56:15.120 --> 56:16.599
Are you OK?

56:16.600 --> 56:17.639
Yeah.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.559
What happened?

56:19.560 --> 56:20.640
Erm...

56:22.360 --> 56:24.960
Change of plan. We can't do this.
Not tonight.

56:26.760 --> 56:28.399
Are you OK?

56:28.400 --> 56:29.680
I'm fine.

56:31.280 --> 56:32.440
Fine.

56:38.160 --> 56:39.999
Miss Kent?

56:40.000 --> 56:41.840
Can I have a word?

56:44.080 --> 56:45.400
Sure.

56:47.040 --> 56:48.240
Please.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.880
Would you like some tea?

57:00.880 --> 57:03.319
I'm not an easy man, Miss Kent.

57:03.320 --> 57:04.600
I know that.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.680
I don't trust easily.

57:09.400 --> 57:12.480
Because nothing's more important
to me than my family.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.840
Nothing.

57:18.240 --> 57:19.600
Some milk?

57:22.720 --> 57:26.679
But I'd be a fool not to notice the
effect you've had on my grandson.

57:26.680 --> 57:29.240
And my son, for that matter.

57:32.440 --> 57:36.840
They both adore you.
Even I can see that.

57:42.200 --> 57:43.760
I've been too hard on you.

57:48.840 --> 57:51.799
I just want to apologise.

57:51.800 --> 57:55.840
And say I hope you'll stay with us
for a long, long time.

58:05.280 --> 58:09.879
Yesterday we were leaving together.
Today you can't look me in the eye.

58:09.880 --> 58:11.479
What is it you want?

58:11.480 --> 58:13.799
Not what, Mr Keel. Who.

58:13.800 --> 58:16.919
Those things that happened to you,

58:16.920 --> 58:20.359
if you can remember it, you won't
have to be afraid any more.

58:20.360 --> 58:22.759
I have to ask you not to
leave the house.

58:22.760 --> 58:24.200
We need to get her out of there.

58:24.201 --> 58:27.279
They'll torture her.
Like they did Hasan.

58:27.280 --> 58:28.719
Standby. Armed.

58:28.720 --> 58:30.239
Targets entering kill zone.

58:30.240 --> 58:32.399
What shall we do?!

58:32.400 --> 58:33.679
Deacon?

58:33.680 --> 58:35.319
Shit!

58:35.320 --> 58:37.239
You know how this will end.

58:37.240 --> 58:39.479
There's one last decision
to be taken.

58:39.480 --> 58:40.719
Which is?

58:40.720 --> 58:42.360
Sam Hunter.

59:05.840 --> 59:09.320
