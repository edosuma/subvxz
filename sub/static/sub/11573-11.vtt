WEBVTT

00:06.257 --> 00:09.966
You're in the wrong place. And you're
making the wrong conversation.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.543
I'm not done with you.

00:12.638 --> 00:15.050
Remember how it ended
between us the last time we met.

00:15.141 --> 00:17.848
You think you're going to come
out any better if we play again?

00:21.147 --> 00:24.605
This time, you're the one
who won't see it coming.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.479
Imagine, a Light Fae lawman

00:27.570 --> 00:30.607
coming into a club owned by
the Dark and issuing threats.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.155
I could make you do some
very bad things to yourself

00:33.242 --> 00:34.573
and no one would fault me.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.525
You can't control an animal, Vex.

00:36.621 --> 00:38.828
I'd have your throat out
before your first thought.

00:38.915 --> 00:41.531
And leave you with a club
full of human witnesses?

00:41.626 --> 00:43.662
--You wouldn't do that.
--Try me.

00:43.753 --> 00:47.871
Humans or not, you'd do
well to leave while you can.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.124
Thanks for the drink.

00:53.804 --> 00:58.138
Well, that was a nice visit.
Who wants a drink?

00:58.226 --> 01:02.139
Yeah. Let's have some fun.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.691
Two tablespoons of chili powder.

01:08.778 --> 01:10.314
All right.

01:11.739 --> 01:15.072
And finally, the ground cumin.

01:15.159 --> 01:17.070
--Mmm-mm-mm!
--You know, I didn't know you could cook.

01:17.161 --> 01:19.402
Please, I spent a whole
month running a sweet con

01:19.497 --> 01:21.283
as a high society caterer.

01:21.374 --> 01:23.956
Well, I didn't know that either.

01:24.043 --> 01:24.828
You know, most of the time,

01:24.919 --> 01:28.457
you know the least about the peeps
that are closest to you. It's, like, so sad.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.538
--Thank you, Dr. Kenzi.
--Yeah.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.624
You know, I wonder what
deep, dark secrets Dyson has.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.551
Oh, now that is a diary I
would kill to get my hands on.

01:35.638 --> 01:37.594
Well, knowing him, you
probably would have to.

01:37.682 --> 01:40.389
Uh huh. All right.

01:40.476 --> 01:43.889
--For the sweet moment of truth, m'lady.
--Uh huh.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.356
All right.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.692
--Oh, wow.
--Oh my god.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.523
Oh, god.

02:01.664 --> 02:03.200
All right. Grilled cheese it is.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.747
Yeah.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.634
Ahh!

02:24.270 --> 02:27.228
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:27.315 --> 02:30.182
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:30.276 --> 02:33.188
My love carries a death sentence.

02:33.279 --> 02:35.395
l was lost for years,

02:35.489 --> 02:38.151
searching, while hiding,

02:38.242 --> 02:42.360
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

02:42.455 --> 02:47.370
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.193
[BO] And after Spain,
where did Dyson live?

03:20.284 --> 03:24.744
Let me think. He spent some
time in Iceland, fifty years or so.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.570
--Reykjavik.
--But he was always a cop?

03:26.665 --> 03:29.327
Not always. What's with all
the questions all of a sudden?

03:29.418 --> 03:31.158
She's suddenly become
obsessed with learning

03:31.253 --> 03:33.835
all of Dyson's deep, dark secrets.

03:33.923 --> 03:35.504
Just hope she doesn't
get into yours, Trickster.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.001
Hey, you can't blame me
for wanting to know more

03:37.093 --> 03:38.708
about a man that I'm involved with.

03:38.803 --> 03:41.044
Perhaps, I should
explain that the phrase,

03:41.138 --> 03:44.847
"Curiosity killed the cat"
is not just an empty saying.

03:46.769 --> 03:48.054
[KENZI] D-man, you're bleeding.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.477
[DYSON] I'm okay.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.065
Sanctuary. | ask for Sanctuary.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.561
Clear the bar, please.
Sanctuary has been invoked.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.734
[BO] What kind of trouble are you in?
[DYSON] I don't know.

03:56.821 --> 03:57.526
Well, are you hurt?

03:57.571 --> 04:00.358
No. It's not my blood.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.485
It's a Dark Fae. A psycho named Ba'al.

04:02.576 --> 04:07.366
Guess he's going to think twice
about messing with the Dyson, huh?

04:07.456 --> 04:09.196
He's dead.

04:09.291 --> 04:14.001
[cell phone ringing]

04:14.088 --> 04:16.670
--Dyson.
--Buddy, where you at?

04:16.757 --> 04:17.667
I'm at the Dal.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.498
[HALE] Helluva time to
be getting your drink on.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.049
Look, there's a lot of
people looking for you.

04:21.137 --> 04:23.970
We got a Dark Fae who looks
like he was a chew toy for a wolf.

04:24.056 --> 04:27.014
Three witnesses say they saw you
threaten him an hour before he died.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.217
Hale, I'm being set up, man.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.437
What the hell were you doing there?

04:30.521 --> 04:33.012
I don't know. I've been
trying to remember,

04:33.107 --> 04:36.190
but I can't remember anything
after I quit work yesterday.

04:36.277 --> 04:39.940
You know the drill, man.
Ash wants you to get yourself in here.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.611
You got to stall for me, okay?

04:41.699 --> 04:46.068
--What are you gonna do?
--I don't know yet, but I will call you.

04:46.162 --> 04:47.618
The Ash wants me to turn myself in.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.991
You can't do that. First thing he'd
do is hand you over to the Dark.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.618
Well, what happened to due process?

04:51.709 --> 04:53.620
You still have a lot to learn
about the way our world works.

04:53.711 --> 04:56.327
Well, sometimes I wish I could
forget about your world.

04:56.422 --> 05:00.210
Look, you tell me what you know
and I will find out who set you up.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.917
I don't want you
anywhere near this, Bo.

05:03.012 --> 05:07.005
Hey, Macho Man, you've saved our
lives, like, a million times. We owe you.

05:07.099 --> 05:11.889
It's not about that. This Ba'al,
he was one of Vex's guys.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.186
I thought Vex was gone.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.638
Well, he came back
a couple weeks ago.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.769
And you didn't think that
was important to tell me?

05:17.860 --> 05:21.352
Bo is our best bet to
find out what happened.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.904
I'll need Hale's help.
We can pool our resources.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.982
Don't put yourself in Vex's way.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.237
There's nothing he would love more
than another chance to get at you.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.910
lam not going to do anything stupid.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.737
Yeah. And I'll be there
to make sure of it.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.663
Yeah, and who's going to make sure
you don't do something stupid?

05:33.751 --> 05:37.915
Look, for a guy that needs our help,
you're making this really tough.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.467
Thanks.

05:47.515 --> 05:50.678
Since I'm going into Vex's living
room, I should probably be packing.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.178
Can I borrow that Siracon again?

05:52.269 --> 05:53.975
It's a restricted weapon.

05:54.063 --> 05:57.226
And when the Ash heard
about you using it against Vex,

05:57.316 --> 05:59.432
I got a visit. It's been confiscated.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.064
Oh, fantastic.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.896
Well, I guess we'll just have to
do this the old-fashioned way.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.481
We're probably going to get
our asses kicked, aren't we?

06:07.576 --> 06:08.486
Let's go.

06:08.577 --> 06:13.321
--Bo.
--|'m going to be fine. I promise.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.030
Better be.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.626
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.800
Oh, you're all this
circus needs right now.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.301
That means you're happy to see us?

06:32.393 --> 06:34.054
It means our boy would be better off

06:34.144 --> 06:36.135
if people didn't start rooting
around where they don't belong.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.345
Well, why don't you just
tell me what you know

06:37.439 --> 06:40.772
and I'll do a lot less damage than if
I'm just out there flailing away, blind.

06:40.859 --> 06:43.316
Trust me, l have seen her flail.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.645
You can't go into Dark Fae territory.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.323
We can. We might be the only
ones that can help Dyson.

06:49.410 --> 06:52.948
Fine. I'll give you what I got.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.950
The Morrigan sent over their
evidence, as per protocol.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.327
Lauren's analyzing
the forensic samples.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.502
Security camera shows that
there were three witnesses.

07:01.589 --> 07:05.798
A Dark Fae bartender named Silas,
a human--goth girl named Portia,

07:05.884 --> 07:08.091
--and the club's owner--
--Vex.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.429
You already had the pleasure.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.629
Yeah, and the pleasure
just about killed her.

07:11.724 --> 07:15.888
And you still want to
go chasing this down?

07:15.978 --> 07:17.388
You're crazier than I thought.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.765
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.603
Bo, they know Dyson and me are tight.

07:23.694 --> 07:26.527
They'll be watching me
hard from both sides.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.401
Now, I'll help in any way I can.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.743
Tell Dyson that I still got his back.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.819
He knows. Thanks.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.043
What'll you have, girls?

07:44.131 --> 07:48.170
A couple of Black Orgasms
and some conversation.

07:48.260 --> 07:51.297
You are totally rocking
the P.|. right now.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.509
Well, tonight is your lucky night

07:54.600 --> 07:58.889
because I can help you
out on both counts.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.015
This is about that Fae cop
that killed Ba'al, right?

08:01.106 --> 08:02.937
Why are you so sure
the cop killed this Ba'al?

08:03.025 --> 08:05.016
Well, I think it was pretty obvious.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.816
When the cop was here
arguing with Ba'al,

08:06.904 --> 08:08.940
he said something about
the last time they met.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.443
And he said that Ba'al wouldn't
see it coming next time.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.445
Looky, looky, looky-loo.

08:14.536 --> 08:19.405
Look who's come out clubbing.
The unaligned love machine.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.491
Love isn't the first thing
I think of when | see you.

08:21.585 --> 08:25.248
Oh, come on. You don't hold our last
meeting against me, do you, Bo?

08:25.339 --> 08:28.206
A girl usually doesn't forget somebody
trying to make her kill herself.

08:28.300 --> 08:32.885
Oh, yeah, right. Bad move.
I'll make her kill you next time.

08:32.971 --> 08:37.055
Speaking of killing, Dyson
offed a very dear friend of mine.

08:37.142 --> 08:40.680
Yeah, well, from what we hear,
your dear friend was a psycho.

08:40.771 --> 08:43.353
Yeah? Well, it's not nice
to speak ill of the dead.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.305
Did Dyson also tell you
about the relationship

08:45.401 --> 08:48.268
he and Ba'al had before last night?

08:48.362 --> 08:51.479
If I was a police officer,
I might even see a motive.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.565
We heard someone else saw what
happened. A girl named Portia.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.571
She saw what we all saw.

08:56.662 --> 09:01.372
Dyson threatening to kill poor, poor
Ba'al, and then doing it, apparently.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.573
How do we find this girl?

09:02.668 --> 09:05.034
Oh, come on. I'm not going
to do your work for you, Bo.

09:05.129 --> 09:07.120
But go ahead, knock yourself out.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.500
Another killer in the room
just adds to the excitement.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.331
She's not a killer! Not like you.

09:11.427 --> 09:15.261
Oh no, really? We should
compare scores some time.

09:15.347 --> 09:19.465
You know, we don't have to be
enemies. I could be very friendly.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.642
Just when I think you're
as creepy as you can be,

09:21.729 --> 09:24.345
there you go getting creepier.

09:24.440 --> 09:28.353
I'm serious about having you here.
Look at all the human pretties.

09:28.444 --> 09:30.309
Like a succubus buffet.

09:30.404 --> 09:33.521
You could have whoever you want,
be as strong as you want.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.571
No hassle. No guilt.

09:35.659 --> 09:38.366
Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.

09:38.454 --> 09:40.240
Enjoy yourself.

09:42.124 --> 09:43.409
So, what now?

09:43.500 --> 09:47.038
All we have to do is find a girl dressed
in black in the middle of a goth club.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.962
Rapid calculation?
That is about everybody.

09:50.048 --> 09:53.211
Including me, in a
pigeonhole-me-and-die sort of way.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.338
But don't worry, I will sniff her out.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.511
You sure you're okay with
sticking around to find her?

09:57.598 --> 09:58.838
It's Friday night.

09:58.932 --> 10:03.050
Where better to be than a
deadly Dark Fae dance club?

10:03.145 --> 10:04.885
You know?

10:06.982 --> 10:08.347
I hope these clothes are okay.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.649
I grabbed the first thing
I found in your closet.

10:10.736 --> 10:13.819
Anything without blood
on it is the style of the day.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.231
You know, I've never asked
you about this before.

10:17.326 --> 10:18.691
What does it mean, anyway?

10:18.786 --> 10:20.868
Souvenirs of battles I've been in.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.160
Lords I've had fealty to.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.623
What language is it in?

10:23.707 --> 10:24.662
Lycanthrope.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.833
Wolf shifters of both the Light and
Dark have used it for millennia.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.253
It's a lot of ink. You must
have killed a lot of people.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.796
You starting to think I did it, too?

10:32.883 --> 10:35.966
No. I know you didn't do it. I just...

10:36.053 --> 10:37.918
...I want to get to know you better.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.095
But now that you mention it,
both the bartender and Vex

10:40.182 --> 10:42.173
swear that you were
threatening Ba'al at the bar.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.553
And Vex even said you
had a reason to kill him.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.636
I wouldn't have done it like this.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.846
Threaten Ba'al in public and
then kill him an hour later?

10:48.941 --> 10:51.683
Well, what did this guy do
to piss you off so bad?

10:51.777 --> 10:53.608
It was years ago.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.481
My partner and I were
tracking some Dark Fae

10:55.572 --> 10:58.814
who were leaving a trail
of bodies around town.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.774
We got a call to go to a house uptown.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.827
When we got there, we found
a husband and wife, butchered.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.576
But whoever did it left
a sink full of blood.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.203
That's when I knew it was a redcap.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.035
A redcap? What is that?
Some kind of team thing?

11:11.129 --> 11:14.963
A kind of team that uses their
victim's blood to dye their hats.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.665
They're the street
gangs of the Fae world.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.216
Well, what about Ba'al?

11:18.303 --> 11:21.215
I mean, even the Dark don't let their
people leave bodies lying around.

11:21.306 --> 11:24.218
They let it slide.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.426
I went after him to try and get some
justice, but he got the drop on me.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.806
Stuck me with a silver blade.

11:28.897 --> 11:32.060
I almost bled out while he
just stood there watching.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.310
Finally, my partner showed up.

11:33.402 --> 11:36.815
--And they didn't do anything to him?
--It was humans being murdered, Bo.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.612
Fair game, as far as the
Light and Dark are concerned.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.736
And my going against
him was unsanctioned.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.658
As far as they were concerned,
it was just self-defence.

11:43.745 --> 11:47.078
Jeffrey Dahmer could plead
self-defence with these guys.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.657
So, did I have a reason to kill him? Yes.

11:50.752 --> 11:54.495
Did I want to kill him? Yes.

11:54.590 --> 11:57.457
But why yesterday? Why would I
do it in front of the whole world?

11:57.551 --> 12:01.385
Well, somebody out there knows.
And they know why they set you up.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.632
We're going to find them

12:03.724 --> 12:06.716
and we're going to bring
justice to Fae town.

12:10.606 --> 12:16.602
So noble. Such a heroic call
to arms. So adorably goofy.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.276
Sorry. Bar is closed right now.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.570
Think of me as a V.|.P.

12:20.657 --> 12:21.612
I do.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.065
I don't see you here that often.

12:23.160 --> 12:28.280
I never developed a taste for
stale beer and ptomaine poisoning.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.749
Now that we have the
niceties out of the way,

12:29.833 --> 12:32.245
why don't you just hand over Dyson
and we can get this over with?

12:32.336 --> 12:33.872
He's not going anywhere.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.999
Hm. I hoped someone would say that.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.851
A double load of iron and silver.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.278
Not the most pleasant
way for a Fae to pass.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.152
You don't really think that
you can keep him, do you?

13:04.242 --> 13:06.153
We handed over our
evidence. He's ours now.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.326
Sanctuary is Sanctuary.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.199
It will take a higher power
than you to pry him loose.

13:10.290 --> 13:15.125
Okay, old man. You want to
play by the rules, we will.

13:15.212 --> 13:19.251
But when all the games are played out,
I'll have Dyson's head for my wall.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.394
You shouldn't have done that.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.764
What? And not uphold the
tradition of Sanctuary?

13:33.855 --> 13:35.061
The Morrigan gets you in her sights,

13:35.148 --> 13:36.854
she's going to make
you a special project.

13:36.942 --> 13:39.809
And from what I can see, it doesn't take
much for her to want to get her kill on.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.144
I don't want anyone
else suffering for this.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.820
So, what, we're just supposed
to let them execute you

13:43.907 --> 13:45.147
for something that you didn't do?

13:45.242 --> 13:47.824
I should be out there
finding out what happened.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.072
Every Fae on the street
will be looking for you.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.700
I wouldn't be surprised if the
Morrigan's already put out a reward.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.907
You're staying here and that's that.

13:57.129 --> 13:59.871
Look, I know that not doing
anything is killing you.

13:59.965 --> 14:03.583
And watching it isn't much easier for
me, but I am going to figure this out.

14:03.677 --> 14:08.171
And you are going to stay here
and you're going to trust me.

14:08.265 --> 14:11.428
Or do I have to drain you
into submission, huh?

14:14.479 --> 14:16.891
Threats, threats.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.906
If you go to Vex's club,
you're just walking into his hands.

14:27.993 --> 14:31.281
Hey, he's the one who invited
me to spend some time there.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.613
He might even be sweet on me.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.040
Just watch yourself, okay?

14:41.965 --> 14:43.501
Are things going to
be okay 'til I get back?

14:43.592 --> 14:46.550
The Morrigan won't make a move
until she gets support from the Elders.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.503
But if she does, there
might not be much I can do.

14:49.598 --> 14:50.963
But there are things I can do.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.346
Now remember, Vex can
get into your head.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.392
But there are ways you
can get into his, too.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.061
I know.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.739
What do you know about Kirins?

15:09.826 --> 15:11.657
That they can reach into your
mind and retrieve memories

15:11.745 --> 15:14.953
that you thought were lost.
I also know they're dangerous.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.326
I don't remember what
happened last night.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.284
It's just a matter of time before
the Morrigan gets what she wants.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.164
--Got to try.
--0 kay.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.631
I'll see if I can find someone.

15:23.715 --> 15:27.879
'Til then, keep your hands off my taps.
I'm still running you a tab.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.096
Hey.

15:37.187 --> 15:40.975
Hello, tall, dark and gruesome.

15:41.066 --> 15:44.399
My name's Tenebrae. It means dark.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.228
I figured it for dim, anyway.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.943
Do you feel the
connection between us?

15:51.034 --> 15:54.777
Both of us stuck in our fleshy prisons.

15:54.871 --> 15:57.123
We could leave here and spend
an evening of dark delights

15:57.207 --> 15:59.789
back at my inner sanctum.

15:59.876 --> 16:04.040
What makes me think your inner
sanctum is your mom's basement?

16:04.131 --> 16:08.374
I like to think of it as the
dark core of the home.

16:08.468 --> 16:13.007
Hey, I'm looking for a girl
named Portia. Do you know her?

16:13.098 --> 16:16.261
She's a thrall to the Dark one
they call Vex and his cabal.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.182
You should leave her alone.

16:18.270 --> 16:22.434
Unless you wish for their
terrible gaze to fall upon you.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.936
Honey, I just wish for
my gaze to fall upon her.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.312
Okay? So, where is she?

16:28.864 --> 16:30.320
There.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.326
Word of advice--you ever want to
get a girl back to your inner sanctum,

16:36.413 --> 16:39.951
you got to lighten up
your game some. Okay?

16:42.127 --> 16:46.291
I'm sad now. But we shall
meet again in the eternal void.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.999
This Ba'al has a crap-load
of enemies, even in the Dark.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.709
Too many to count and not
enough time to interview them all.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.340
Well, how about Dyson?
You think one of his enemies

16:54.431 --> 16:55.921
might have set him up?

16:56.016 --> 17:00.055
Honestly? He might even
have more enemies than Ba'al.

17:00.145 --> 17:03.478
I mean, in case you haven't noticed,
our boy has a short fuse...

17:03.565 --> 17:06.102
...and big teeth.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.229
So, he's killed like this before?

17:08.320 --> 17:10.982
The man was a stone warrior
for a couple hundred years.

17:11.072 --> 17:13.063
He's only been a cop for the last fifty.

17:13.158 --> 17:14.022
Do you think he did it?

17:14.117 --> 17:16.073
Not without good reason.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.202
Well, did you have anything
else on these witnesses?

17:19.289 --> 17:21.530
Well, the bartender
doesn't have a profile.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.957
As for the girl, she's a
runaway from up north.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.659
She's been kicking around
the streets for a few months

17:25.754 --> 17:27.665
and then washed up at Vex's place.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.747
Which means it's only a matter of
time before she's on the menu

17:29.841 --> 17:31.456
for Vex or one of his freaks.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.258
Not good. But also not our business.

17:34.346 --> 17:37.838
Well, that only leaves Vex as a witness
and I see him more as a suspect.

17:37.933 --> 17:40.345
Well, from what I hear,
Ba'al was pretty loyal to him.

17:40.435 --> 17:43.552
I don't think loyalty means
anything to guys like Vex.

17:43.647 --> 17:44.887
Did you have any luck
finding out where Dyson was

17:44.981 --> 17:46.232
before he visited the club?

17:46.316 --> 17:48.682
There was a couple hours
between when he finished his shift

17:48.777 --> 17:51.234
and when he was
supposedly at the club.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.982
I mean, the whole thing
is a blank to him.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.439
[phone ringing]

17:55.533 --> 17:57.660
Hale.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.451
Yeah. Send her in.

18:00.538 --> 18:05.123
It's Lauren. She's finished the workup
on the material from Ba'al's autopsy.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.290
Oh, I didn't know you'd be here.

18:09.381 --> 18:10.666
Well, I didn't think to warn you.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.622
I didn't mean that.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.094
DOW. m SOI'I' .
lk |' y

18:15.178 --> 18:16.884
Is there something going on
here I should know about?

18:16.972 --> 18:18.633
--No.
--No.

18:18.723 --> 18:22.261
Yeah, okay. So, what did you find?

18:27.190 --> 18:30.432
As you can see, the teeth marks
are consistent with a canine bite

18:30.527 --> 18:33.394
and not inconsistent
with Dyson's wolf shape.

18:33.488 --> 18:37.356
And with a lot of other shape-shifters,
not to mention actual canines.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.782
Dyson will have to turn himself
in to get an impression made.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.576
What? No, not happening.
He leaves that bar, he's fair game.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.076
I know that Dyson and I haven't
always been on the best of terms,

18:45.166 --> 18:47.077
but I am actually trying to help here.

18:47.168 --> 18:50.535
You think turning him over
to the Dark is helping?

18:50.630 --> 18:54.088
We're still waiting on analysis from the
animal hairs they found on the body.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.881
Hopefully, they won't
match Dyson's D.N.A.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.334
and hopefully, we'll get them on time.

18:57.429 --> 19:00.887
That's way too many "hopefullys."

19:00.974 --> 19:03.135
I'll keep working on it.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.602
You're not going to give up, are you?

19:08.690 --> 19:09.645
I guess not.

19:09.733 --> 19:12.816
You know, Dyson's a
particular kind of man.

19:12.902 --> 19:16.030
A man like him will give up too
much for someone he cares for.

19:16.114 --> 19:21.404
Sometimes everything. I worry
about him getting in too deep.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.906
I thought maybe you'd be bad for him.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.867
You might have been right.

19:26.958 --> 19:32.328
Nah. Not even. You're the real thing.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.681
Hey, I'm Kenzi.

19:45.769 --> 19:46.975
Portia.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.553
This club is gloom-tastic, huh?

19:49.647 --> 19:50.932
It's the best music in town.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.264
Cool. You been coming here long?

19:52.359 --> 19:54.896
A few months. It's kind of the
only place people don't try to

19:54.986 --> 19:58.228
turn me into a project and
try to save me or something.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.359
Oh, girl, you don't look
like you need saving.

20:00.450 --> 20:03.066
You got to be able to take care
of yourself in this world, right?

20:03.161 --> 20:06.824
Yeah, I hear you. I've been on
my own since I was, like, fifteen.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.200
You got to learn the skills out there.

20:08.291 --> 20:11.704
You got to play them
before they play you, right?

20:11.795 --> 20:13.786
Hey, I heard some guy got
killed here last night.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.871
That is pretty hardcore, huh?

20:15.965 --> 20:19.173
He was a dick. A lot of the
staff are like that around here.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.841
The only nice one is
Silas, the bartender.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.760
Well, if the guy who got
killed was such a bad guy,

20:22.847 --> 20:26.089
then I'm sure lots of people must
have been lining up to dust him, right?

20:26.184 --> 20:28.175
It was some cop who did it.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.225
--You sure?
--|'m sure.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.893
I went outside after Ba'al
and the cop fought.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.939
Then the cop came outside
and he went into this alley.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.109
And then Ba'al came outside
and he went into the alley.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.482
And then I heard this
growling and screaming.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.736
And when I looked, some
big-assed wolf was killing Ba'al.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.159
I think that wolf was the cop.

20:48.081 --> 20:51.289
Man, the drugs they sell
here must be kicking.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.707
--No, really.
--Whoo!

20:52.794 --> 20:54.580
It's what I saw.

20:58.007 --> 21:01.966
Patrick. Good to see you.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.510
I was wondering when the
Light was going to show up.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.303
I'm surprised you made it
a personal appearance.

21:06.391 --> 21:09.178
Detective Dyson's
welfare is our first priority.

21:09.269 --> 21:13.103
We want to get this difficult situation
behind him as quickly as possible.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.099
You're wasting your time if you think

21:14.190 --> 21:16.977
Dyson's going to hand himself
over to the Dark to be executed.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.730
There'll be a process.

21:19.821 --> 21:24.656
But we all know how that
process will end, don't we?

21:24.742 --> 21:26.733
I'm following procedure.

21:26.828 --> 21:29.490
A part of the job that seems
to be eluding you lately.

21:29.581 --> 21:32.573
If you come with me, you'll be
appointed the best representation.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.658
There are many ways
to structure a defence.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.333
A defence for whose benefit, I wonder.

21:36.421 --> 21:39.208
If he's handed over, whatever
follows will be a formality.

21:39.299 --> 21:42.211
He will be found guilty
and he will be executed.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.338
There are no ways to say this gently,

21:44.429 --> 21:48.468
but if he's not handed over, the Dark
will find a way to take him, anyway.

21:48.558 --> 21:52.642
The more you fight that, the closer
you'll bring us back to the brink of war.

21:52.729 --> 21:55.812
Dyson, you're a reasonable man.

21:55.899 --> 21:59.391
You don't want to be responsible
for the suffering of so many Fae.

21:59.486 --> 22:02.944
And he doesn't want to commit
suicide by giving himself over.

22:03.031 --> 22:06.148
You hold this position, even if it
means defying my direct order?

22:06.242 --> 22:10.952
Sanctuary is Sanctuary. Dyson remains
here until he decides to leave.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.530
You do realize that this
could also mean the end

22:13.625 --> 22:17.243
of whatever strange power
position you occupy?

22:17.337 --> 22:19.453
You should be very certain
of your own grasp on power

22:19.547 --> 22:21.162
before you start attacking others.

22:21.257 --> 22:26.502
Ooh, that was the wrong answer.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.300
Gentlemen.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.683
Thanks.

22:44.948 --> 22:45.027
Portia, my friend needs to
ask you some more questions

22:45.031 --> 22:47.773
Portia, my friend needs to
ask you some more questions

22:47.867 --> 22:49.653
about what you saw
in the alley last night.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.530
That's why you were
hanging out with me?

22:51.621 --> 22:55.409
No! Not only. Okay, a little bit.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.537
Look, I'm sorry. But the guy
that they say killed Ba'al,

22:58.628 --> 22:59.583
he's a friend of ours.

22:59.671 --> 23:02.754
I'm not getting involved
in this any more than I am.

23:02.840 --> 23:08.631
Hey, you are the only one that might
be able to help our friend. Please.

23:08.721 --> 23:09.801
Please.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.882
I came out of the club, I saw
the cop go into that alley.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.218
And then I saw the wolf killing Ba'al.

23:16.312 --> 23:20.396
| wish I could tell you what you wanted
to hear, but that's what happened.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.399
If he did it, maybe they made him.

23:24.487 --> 23:28.526
I can't imagine anybody making
Dyson do anything, except you.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.356
You could probably make
him jump off a building.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.282
Well, Vex can force
people to do things.

23:32.370 --> 23:35.328
Okay, what about the forgetting?
And why would Vex kill his own friend?

23:35.415 --> 23:37.952
Well, that's stuff that we
still need to figure out.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.291
Thank you.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.132
Look, dude, I'm really sorry
if it seemed like I lied to you,

23:45.216 --> 23:48.003
because I hate when
peeps do that to me.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.050
I get that he's your friend.

23:50.138 --> 23:51.378
Do you have a place to stay tonight?

23:51.472 --> 23:53.337
I've kind of been couch
surfing the last few nights.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.923
I don't know what I'm
going to do tonight.

23:55.018 --> 23:57.805
You want to crash at our place?
It's not a palace.

23:57.895 --> 24:01.228
It's not even a shack,
but it's dry, sometimes.

24:01.316 --> 24:03.602
That sounds good, actually. Thanks.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.479
Okay, let's go.

24:09.532 --> 24:12.740
Hey, there. I was kind of
hoping you'd be back.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.408
You're not afraid to be
seen talking to me?

24:14.495 --> 24:19.034
No. You're what most Fae
dream of being--you're unaligned.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.537
You step outside all these politics.

24:21.628 --> 24:25.041
The rest of us, we just
do what they want.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.543
I mean, look at me, do you think
working here is my choice?

24:27.634 --> 24:29.465
Well, if you're not a big fan of Vex's,

24:29.552 --> 24:32.385
maybe you wouldn't mind telling
me why he had a beef with Ba'al?

24:32.472 --> 24:36.090
I think that sooner or later,
Vex has a beef with everybody.

24:36.184 --> 24:38.641
And when he does, they
don't stay healthy long.

24:38.728 --> 24:43.313
Yeah, I kind of got that
impression. Thanks.

25:02.043 --> 25:03.249
Stop this.

25:03.336 --> 25:05.122
Worst idea I've heard all night.

25:05.213 --> 25:06.703
What do you want from me?

25:06.798 --> 25:10.541
Judging by your little display, I'd
say you want something from me.

25:10.635 --> 25:13.877
Let me go.

25:13.971 --> 25:17.463
Why? You're trying to help
a man who killed my friend.

25:17.558 --> 25:20.174
Dyson didn't do it. You know that.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.224
How would I know that?

25:21.312 --> 25:22.552
Because you did.

25:22.647 --> 25:27.141
Maybe I was wrong about
our beautiful little romance.

25:27.235 --> 25:30.819
You think so badly of me.

25:30.905 --> 25:35.820
If you were to die now, there'd be
no clan to avenge you, would there?

25:40.081 --> 25:44.199
But that would just put a dampener
on the evening's festivities.

25:45.670 --> 25:49.504
Tell your boyfriend to take
responsibility for his own crimes.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.842
I've racked up enough of my own.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.056
This is the guy you found
to go through my brain?

26:08.151 --> 26:10.437
When you've dredged as
many heads as I have,

26:10.528 --> 26:15.022
a little belt before work is mandatory.

26:15.116 --> 26:17.072
Two is even better.

26:19.787 --> 26:22.904
The bar is open after the job is done.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.414
Have you ever worked
with a Kirin before?

26:28.504 --> 26:31.587
--I know the risks.
--Listen, big boy,

26:31.674 --> 26:34.165
knowing the risks isn't the
same as living through it.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.342
What we're about to do
isn't going to be fun for me.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.886
For you, it's going to feel
like somebody's pouring

26:38.973 --> 26:40.964
battery acid in your skull.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.640
Well, don't sugar-coat it for me.

26:43.728 --> 26:46.310
Open your head to me.
It'll be easier for you.

26:46.397 --> 26:51.391
And it'll be less likely that you'll lose
the memories that you want to keep.

26:51.486 --> 26:56.071
Forgetting isn't always
such a bad thing. Just do it.

27:12.381 --> 27:15.339
Show me yesterday afternoon.

27:17.094 --> 27:18.709
Quitting time looks
good on you, brother.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.545
Have one for me on the way home.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.052
[MAN IN BACKGROUND]
Hey, Dyson, line one.

27:26.687 --> 27:27.722
There's nothing there.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.805
There has to be something,
impressions, thoughts.

27:29.899 --> 27:31.935
This isn't some bullshit amnesia case.

27:32.026 --> 27:32.981
Somebody went into his head

27:33.069 --> 27:35.936
and scorched his brain
clean for those few hours.

27:36.030 --> 27:39.614
--How would they do that?
--Maybe somebody like me.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.440
Something somebody gave you.

27:41.536 --> 27:42.946
What, like a Fae roofie?

27:43.037 --> 27:47.201
Yeah, just like that.

27:47.291 --> 27:50.533
'Cause you sure got screwed, partner.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.619
How about that beer?

27:56.300 --> 28:01.511
Must be nice here with you and
Bo, looking after each other.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.804
I'm still getting used to it, myself.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.928
The way things were at home, I kind of
wanted to not be noticed, you know.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.555
That's when things got ugly.

28:08.646 --> 28:09.852
Yeah, I know what you mean.

28:09.939 --> 28:12.851
Even sleeping in parks was better
than staying with them anymore.

28:12.942 --> 28:15.524
But there are better things
than staying on the street.

28:15.611 --> 28:17.602
Like what? Getting a
job in a burger chain

28:17.697 --> 28:20.188
and getting hit on by the
greasy assistant manager?

28:20.283 --> 28:24.117
You tried that too, huh?
Yeah, okay, not that.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.818
But anything would be
better than hanging out

28:25.913 --> 28:28.620
with that demented
psycho, Vex, and his gang.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.448
They're not so bad.

28:30.543 --> 28:34.127
Hello. He gives mental
lunatic killers a bad name.

28:34.213 --> 28:40.334
Well, yeah, but the music is
good there. And Silas is nice.

28:40.428 --> 28:44.967
He takes care of me. He lets
me stay over sometimes.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.888
Did Silas give you that?

28:46.976 --> 28:49.592
Uh yeah, kind of.

28:49.687 --> 28:53.771
Yeah, I kind of pick up
things along the way, too.

28:53.858 --> 28:57.100
Look, Portia. Are you sure
you don't know anything more

28:57.194 --> 28:58.400
about what happened last night?

28:58.487 --> 29:00.352
The cop killed Ba'al.

29:00.448 --> 29:01.904
Are they threatening you?

29:01.991 --> 29:04.357
Because if they are, me and
Bo can totally protect you.

29:04.452 --> 29:07.615
Nobody's threatening me.

29:07.705 --> 29:11.869
Listen, I'm kind of bagged.
Do you mind if I crash?

29:11.959 --> 29:14.336
Yeah, the couch is all yours.

29:14.420 --> 29:18.709
Let me go see if I can
rustle up some clean sheets.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.209
You know, if you stick
around for a few days,

29:20.301 --> 29:22.963
maybe me and Bo can help
you figure out a game plan.

29:23.054 --> 29:25.090
You know, we have some connections
that could probably help,

29:25.181 --> 29:28.548
like, getting a job and... Oh my god.

29:28.643 --> 29:29.974
--What?
--You look like you just lost a fight

29:30.061 --> 29:33.349
to Freddy Krueger. What
the hell happened to you?

29:35.274 --> 29:37.105
I don't know.

29:40.613 --> 29:41.944
Any luck?

29:42.031 --> 29:45.899
I'm sure Vex did it. But no one
there is going to tell me the truth.

29:45.993 --> 29:48.700
How about you? The memory
Fae turn up anything?

29:48.788 --> 29:50.619
I got back a couple more minutes.

29:50.706 --> 29:53.413
The last thing I remember is
getting a call before I left work.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.456
But I don't know from who.

29:54.543 --> 29:58.377
The Kirin says my memories are
gone and they're not coming back.

29:58.464 --> 30:03.584
Well, let's find out who that call
was from and what they know.

30:03.678 --> 30:05.088
--Hale?
--Yeah, I haven't come across

30:05.179 --> 30:09.548
any shape-shifters on our side who
look good for setting up Dyson.

30:09.642 --> 30:11.428
They don't exactly check in with us.

30:11.519 --> 30:12.850
Well, Dyson remembered something.

30:12.937 --> 30:14.802
He got a phone call right
before he left work.

30:14.897 --> 30:15.886
Do you know what that was about?

30:15.982 --> 30:17.893
I was already gone.

30:19.110 --> 30:22.068
Call was logged in for him at 6:05.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.271
[BO] Well, can you
get me the number?

30:25.366 --> 30:30.781
It's an art dealer,
Lyle Harrison, 6597 Merton.

30:30.871 --> 30:32.953
Since when did D start chasing art?

30:33.040 --> 30:36.373
That's a very good question. Thanks.

30:38.587 --> 30:41.454
Does this art dealer by the name
of Lyle Harrison ring a bell?

30:41.549 --> 30:42.459
No, I've never heard of him.

30:42.550 --> 30:46.008
Well, sounds like a piece of this
puzzle is about to get filled in.

30:46.095 --> 30:49.462
Bo. I feel useless just sitting here.

30:49.557 --> 30:50.467
I know.

30:50.558 --> 30:54.221
Look, I'm a shifter. My whole
life has been about the hunt.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.927
I get the scent. I track my pray.
It takes me where I need to go.

30:57.023 --> 31:00.436
But with this, I don't even remember.
I don't even know where to start.

31:00.526 --> 31:05.065
Well, it's just a couple
more hours, so hang tight.

31:05.156 --> 31:07.522
I'm going to go take
care of something.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.992
Yo, Portia. I got some
stuff for your back.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.705
Portia?

31:23.424 --> 31:25.585
So not good.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.334
I really don't understand
what could be so important

31:28.429 --> 31:30.260
that you need to see
me this late at night.

31:30.347 --> 31:33.384
It's about your friend, Vex.

31:33.476 --> 31:37.685
Vex? Well, what a surprise.
Vex sent you?

31:37.772 --> 31:40.684
He put some stuff into
play that got me here.

31:40.775 --> 31:43.107
No. I don't think I
should be talking to you.

31:43.194 --> 31:47.779
You really don't want me
to leave though, do you?

31:47.865 --> 31:49.651
--No.
--No.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.449
--I want--
--You want me.

31:52.536 --> 31:54.652
But what I really need from
you is for you to tell me

31:54.747 --> 31:56.738
why you called that
policeman yesterday.

31:56.832 --> 31:57.821
I can't.

31:57.917 --> 32:05.335
You have to. You see,
I really, really need to know.

32:05.424 --> 32:10.134
I called the police because I was
scared. Things had gone too far.

32:10.221 --> 32:11.882
Mmm. They hooked me up with Dyson.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.883
What had gone too far?

32:13.974 --> 32:18.138
The games. Ba'al had a
special room for V.|.P.s.

32:18.229 --> 32:20.345
Ooh. He'd provide girls.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.055
--What kind of things?
--Pain.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.766
You could play with them and it's
like they wouldn't remember after.

32:25.861 --> 32:27.271
You like pain games, Lyle?

32:27.363 --> 32:28.694
--Yes.
--Yeah?

32:28.781 --> 32:31.944
--Giving or receiving?
--Giving.

32:32.034 --> 32:34.116
The game's different tonight.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.535
What did you tell Dyson?

32:37.623 --> 32:41.662
About the girl.
I said she was special.

32:43.212 --> 32:46.375
She had pink hair. And when he
hurt her, her eyes would glow.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.126
Ba'al took it too far.

32:48.217 --> 32:50.754
I never thought a person
could take that much pain.

32:52.012 --> 32:56.676
He killed her. He said he did
that when he was tired of them.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.723
But that's not what it's about.

32:58.811 --> 33:00.722
--I didn't want that.
--A girl is dead.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.600
And you didn't do anything
to try and stop it.

33:12.616 --> 33:14.698
Was Vex part of this?

33:16.453 --> 33:21.447
Vex took his fun other nights.
Ba'al killed the girl.

33:21.542 --> 33:27.663
You watch where you take your
pleasure next time, or it might take you.

33:32.428 --> 33:35.511
[phone ringing]

33:35.598 --> 33:37.304
Hey, what did you get?

33:37.391 --> 33:39.973
Turns out our Dark Fae friends
are running some kind of funfair

33:40.060 --> 33:42.267
for guys who like pain in
the basement of the club.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.730
What does that have to do with Dyson?

33:43.814 --> 33:45.645
[BO] Harrison said they killed a girl.

33:45.733 --> 33:49.476
She had pink hair. He said he thought he
saw her eyes glow when she was hurt.

33:49.570 --> 33:54.234
Okay, hold on. Wait, wait wait.
I recognize that description.

33:54.325 --> 33:58.910
It's a Light Fae girl, missing person.

33:58.996 --> 34:03.114
Mica Ruth Gray. She's a Light
Fae out of North Fordham.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.450
She left home a couple of weeks ago.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.330
And she turned up in
Vex's and Ba'al killed her.

34:07.421 --> 34:08.831
And you think that's
why Dyson did him?

34:08.923 --> 34:10.629
--For killing her?
--[BO] No, no, he wouldn't have.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.628
I mean, it would have been so easy
to report Ba'al for killing a Light Fae.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.334
His own people would
have turned him in.

34:15.429 --> 34:18.171
Yeah, well, none of
this makes any sense.

34:18.265 --> 34:20.597
Yeah. Well, it's going
to start pretty soon.

34:22.269 --> 34:26.729
Yes, I called you a coward. There
should be a chicken on your clan crest.

34:28.067 --> 34:33.482
The Ash has to take it to a vote. And I
need to know that you're on Dyson's side.

34:35.991 --> 34:42.032
Don't even start! You chose
your allegiance. We're done!

34:44.583 --> 34:46.995
You have to stop doing that.

34:49.213 --> 34:50.703
You can't throw away
your friendships for me.

34:50.798 --> 34:54.586
I appreciate this as a time to find
out who's worth calling a friend.

34:54.677 --> 34:57.885
They're going to force the issue.
They'll make you suffer, too.

34:57.972 --> 35:01.885
It wouldn't be the first time.
And it won't be the last.

35:04.061 --> 35:06.302
--What are you doing?
--|'m going to finish this

35:06.397 --> 35:08.228
one way or the other.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.021
Dyson!

35:12.486 --> 35:14.727
Damn it.

35:14.822 --> 35:16.028
Kenzi?

35:16.115 --> 35:17.901
Bo, Bo, Bo, this is bad.
This is, like, mega-bad.

35:17.992 --> 35:19.732
Super ultra freaky-town
bad. She's gone.

35:19.827 --> 35:20.782
Slow down. What happened?

35:20.869 --> 35:22.450
Portia ran away. And I saw her back.

35:22.538 --> 35:23.744
They did something to her.
They hurt her.

35:23.831 --> 35:25.822
Like some kind of pervy torture hurt.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.827
I know. Ba'al was running a club
for people with a taste for that

35:27.918 --> 35:31.160
in the basement. Kenzi, there
were more besides Portia.

35:31.255 --> 35:34.167
I don't know why, but she doesn't
remember what happened to her.

35:34.258 --> 35:37.045
Well, there's a lot of amnesia
going around these days.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.673
But it's convenient how good she
is at remembering what Dyson did.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.299
I'm afraid I know where she went.

35:41.390 --> 35:42.926
Let's go.

36:08.709 --> 36:11.496
Tell me who took my memory!
Tell me who killed Ba'al.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.828
Just what we wanted to ask you.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.789
So nice you saved us the
trouble of coming to get you.

36:16.884 --> 36:18.215
Don't even think about it.

36:18.302 --> 36:21.965
Not unless you want those who are
protecting you to suffer, as well.

36:32.191 --> 36:35.649
| just love to see
justice done, don't you?

36:39.782 --> 36:42.899
I really, really hope Portia wasn't
stupid enough to come back here.

36:42.993 --> 36:44.494
Well, she's an easy loose end to tie up.

36:44.578 --> 36:47.069
None of these Fae would
give a damn about her.

36:47.164 --> 36:51.203
Okay, so Harrison said they
took the girls to the V.|.P. room.

36:51.293 --> 36:52.578
You ready to go clubbing?

36:52.669 --> 36:57.379
Yeah. This is gonna give
"Girls Go Wild" a whole new meaning.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.096
I don't know what you think
I'm going to tell you.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.420
I don't know what happened.

37:04.515 --> 37:09.009
Honestly, I don't really care, lovey.
Ba'al was a liability, anyway.

37:09.103 --> 37:11.139
What I really want to know

37:11.230 --> 37:15.143
is all the juicy gossip about
your little succubus girlfriend.

37:15.234 --> 37:18.852
Why don't you ask Vex?
He knows where she came from.

37:18.946 --> 37:20.811
I lied.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.481
Well, you know what she knows.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.158
But not as much as you do.

37:29.206 --> 37:32.198
You're not much of a
poker player, are you, wolfy?

37:32.292 --> 37:37.082
That's okay. It might take
some time, but you'll tell us.

37:37.172 --> 37:40.835
And what entertainment it
will be getting it out of you.

37:55.899 --> 38:00.643
What do you think? We find out
what's behind door number one?

38:04.450 --> 38:05.735
[KENZI] All right, kid, playtime's over.

38:05.826 --> 38:07.782
--We got to get you out of here.
--No, I'm... I'm okay.

38:07.870 --> 38:09.952
I take it "okay" means something
different in your world.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.029
He wouldn't let them hurt me.
He never would.

38:12.124 --> 38:15.867
"He" who? Where did you get that?

38:15.961 --> 38:17.701
[KENZI] She said Silas the
bartender gave it to her.

38:17.796 --> 38:18.956
She said he takes care of her. Why?

38:19.047 --> 38:20.753
[BO] I recognize these symbols.

38:20.841 --> 38:23.753
Dyson said it's the secret
language of the wolf shifters.

38:23.844 --> 38:26.460
I think we just found
out who killed Ba'al.

38:29.349 --> 38:31.305
Just finish it.

38:31.393 --> 38:33.679
This is getting boring.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.806
I have a feeling you're
going to disappoint me.

38:35.898 --> 38:37.388
Believe it.

38:37.483 --> 38:38.973
It won't be a total loss.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.523
Finish it.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.732
Everybody stay calm. It would
be a shame to ruin your makeup.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.112
Bo, get out of here.

38:50.204 --> 38:53.196
We're going together. Cut him loose.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.656
Oh, please, you don't think you're
going to get away with this, do you?

38:55.751 --> 38:58.117
He's a marked man
and you will be, too.

38:59.588 --> 39:01.749
Not if I can prove that
Dyson didn't kill Ba'al.

39:01.840 --> 39:05.128
Oh, come on. You're not going to
blame that again on me, are you?

39:05.219 --> 39:07.801
Why don't you tell
them who did it, Silas?

39:10.057 --> 39:11.638
Where do you think you're going?

39:11.725 --> 39:13.511
He's the one who cooked up
the drinks around here.

39:13.602 --> 39:16.344
Including the ones that Ba'al used
to wipe the girls' memories clean

39:16.438 --> 39:17.598
after he finished using them.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.601
Oh, that's absurd.
Why would Silas kill Ba'al?

39:20.692 --> 39:23.525
The same reason most
people do things.

39:23.612 --> 39:24.397
For love.

39:24.488 --> 39:27.571
Silas knew that Portia was
going to be killed by Ba'al.

39:27.658 --> 39:30.240
The same way he killed all the other
girls when he got tired of them.

39:30.327 --> 39:31.988
Here's how it went down--

39:32.079 --> 39:35.947
Dyson was questioning Silas about
a Light Fae girl that Ba'al killed.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.157
Silas knew that Dyson
would go mental on Ba'al,

39:38.252 --> 39:43.713
so he saw his chance to get rid of Ba'al
and put the blame on somebody else.

39:43.799 --> 39:45.881
[BO] And after Dyson
had it out with Ba'al,

39:45.968 --> 39:48.505
Silas waited for him in the alley.

39:49.930 --> 39:52.763
All he had to do next was
send Ba'al out there alone,

39:52.849 --> 39:56.307
follow him and take his revenge.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.903
The girl saw the murder.

40:11.994 --> 40:16.454
Silas made up the story, okay. He got
Portia to lie and say that she saw it.

40:16.540 --> 40:17.905
Silas, I didn't tell.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.959
Even if that were true, do you really
think we'd just let you walk out of here?

40:22.045 --> 40:24.627
We've already called it
in to Dyson's partner.

40:24.715 --> 40:26.376
So, if all of you want
to be considered a party

40:26.466 --> 40:30.004
to what Ba'al did to the
Light Fae girl, be my guest.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.552
Yeah, that global Fae dust-up
you're all so worried about

40:32.639 --> 40:34.015
is going to start for real.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.432
Oh, this night did not
turn out the way I planned.

40:37.519 --> 40:38.679
Portia, you have to come with us.

40:38.770 --> 40:42.058
I couldn't let them kill you, Portia.

40:42.149 --> 40:44.731
--|'m sorry.
--|'m not leaving him here.

40:44.818 --> 40:46.979
There's nothing we can do.

40:49.573 --> 40:53.942
Oh well, this evening
won't be a total loss.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.879
Detective, I want you to
know how happy I am

41:14.973 --> 41:16.804
about the outcome
of the investigation.

41:16.892 --> 41:19.304
The Dark have completely
dropped their action against you.

41:19.394 --> 41:20.383
ReaHy?

41:20.479 --> 41:23.391
It appears they found
the killer themselves.

41:23.482 --> 41:25.973
Well, they do some
good work sometimes.

41:26.068 --> 41:29.105
Dyson, I want you to
know that, personally,

41:29.196 --> 41:30.982
I'm happy it all turned out okay.

41:31.073 --> 41:36.739
Well, personally, I think somebody's
ruining a perfectly good celebration.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.444
This affair has been
instructive, old man.

41:39.539 --> 41:43.031
I sense we are headed toward a
more substantial disagreement.

41:43.126 --> 41:45.993
Was there ever any doubt?

41:46.088 --> 41:48.249
I suppose not.

41:54.471 --> 41:56.837
I never thanked you, my friend.

41:56.932 --> 41:59.469
You were going to put it
all on the line for me.

41:59.559 --> 42:02.016
I couldn't do anything less
for my best customer.

42:02.104 --> 42:06.347
But just promise not to
make it a regular occurrence.

42:06.441 --> 42:08.272
On my honour.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.232
So, what are you going to do now?

42:13.323 --> 42:14.938
I'm not going to go home,
if that's what you're asking.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.866
Whoa. You got the wrong girl, sista.

42:17.953 --> 42:20.740
I don't know what those people are,
but they're not like us, are they?

42:20.831 --> 42:23.038
They're different.

42:23.125 --> 42:24.581
Yeah.

42:24.668 --> 42:31.005
They're... they're different. But in most
ways, they're just like everybody else.

42:31.091 --> 42:34.128
You sure you don't want to
crash here for a few more days?

42:34.219 --> 42:39.054
No. I saw a sign for a job
in a window and I applied.

42:39.141 --> 42:42.258
They said I could have a shot. They
even gave me an advance for a room.

42:42.352 --> 42:44.684
Nice. A burger joint
with a greasy manager?

42:44.771 --> 42:48.184
No way. Pizzas.
And the manager's a she.

42:48.275 --> 42:52.393
Well, remember, when I order
pizza, I like extra pepperoni.

42:54.364 --> 42:56.070
Can I call you?

42:56.158 --> 42:58.194
Yeah. You better.

43:05.333 --> 43:07.198
You know, you're the only one
I haven't thanked properly.

43:07.294 --> 43:10.252
Oh, you don't have to thank me.

43:10.338 --> 43:13.296
I need to thank you more than anyone.

43:13.383 --> 43:15.590
You were always so sure I didn't do it.

43:15.677 --> 43:19.169
Well, it turns out I didn't have to
ask all those questions after all.

43:19.264 --> 43:20.800
I know you.

43:20.891 --> 43:23.223
Yeah, I think I know you, too.
