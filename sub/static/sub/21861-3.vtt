WEBVTT

00:07.760 --> 00:09.760
The license plate thing wasn't me.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.490
I swear to God.

00:11.560 --> 00:15.100
If it was, I would admit it,
because it's fucking funny.

00:16.670 --> 00:17.530
But it wasn't.

00:18.330 --> 00:20.200
How could I...? Look, here's the thing.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.200
How could I have hit her car...?

00:22.640 --> 00:26.310
How could I have vandalized her car
if I don't even know what it looks like?

00:28.240 --> 00:31.080
- Yo, whose car is this?
- Mrs. Shit-piro.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.050
Yo soy Shapiro. Uh... Uh...

00:37.690 --> 00:39.490
Me gusta them titties.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.260
So, you lied to me.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.800
Dude, I honestly forgot about this video
until just now.

00:46.060 --> 00:47.760
Dylan, no, you didn't.
You lied to me.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.700
Whatever.
I lie about all kinds of little stuff,

00:50.770 --> 00:51.630
like...

00:52.540 --> 00:54.140
that I understood Inception.

00:55.340 --> 00:56.770
Dude, it's simple, all right?

00:56.840 --> 00:59.080
Our dreams have levels, dog.

00:59.140 --> 01:01.340
Dude, you keep... You always say that.

01:01.410 --> 01:04.310
- Like, I still don't...
- That's what it is. Is that our dreams...

01:04.379 --> 01:05.379
So, you have, like...

01:05.680 --> 01:07.520
I get that, but how did they get

01:07.580 --> 01:10.320
into the other guy's dream?
That doesn't make sense to me.

01:10.390 --> 01:11.290
They have that box.

01:11.350 --> 01:14.360
Guys. Guys. Why did you guys lie
about the license plate prank?

01:16.190 --> 01:16.860
Honestly?

01:18.290 --> 01:19.230
Off the record?

01:19.660 --> 01:24.530
Because... Spencer's Instagram is private.
I didn't think you'd be able to see it.

01:25.670 --> 01:29.510
Yo, Pete, why is this even
in the documentary right now, man?

01:29.570 --> 01:33.610
I mean, this makes me look super guilty.
You're supposed to be liberating me, dude.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.650
I'm not trying to liberate anyone.
I'm trying to find the truth.

01:36.710 --> 01:39.110
And I can't do that
unless you're honest with me.

01:39.180 --> 01:40.820
And this news is really disappointing.

01:42.690 --> 01:45.350
Help me help you, Dylan.
I need the truth from now on.

01:45.420 --> 01:46.390
Oh, no.

01:47.260 --> 01:51.360
Pete, man, dude, you sound
just like fucking Shapiro right now.

01:51.860 --> 01:54.330
The guy said "help me help you."
Did you hear that?

01:54.400 --> 01:57.700
- That's some teacher shit.
- That is some straight-up teacher shit.

02:23.590 --> 02:25.860
Everyone has their own version
of the truth.

02:25.930 --> 02:30.270
When the stories begin to conflict,
the hard part is picking out the lies.

02:30.700 --> 02:33.170
We've heard Dylan's side of the story,
and frankly,

02:33.240 --> 02:34.900
it's starting to get harder to believe.

02:35.470 --> 02:36.410
What are we doing?

02:36.870 --> 02:41.180
Uh, I'm just getting some B-roll.
Just go about your business. Whatever.

02:42.780 --> 02:46.320
We've also heard from Alex
Trimboli, the school board's key witness.

02:46.380 --> 02:49.720
He started with that row,
and hit each car as he went along,

02:50.250 --> 02:53.290
and then he went to the next row,
and hit each car along that row.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.890
But as we've learned, he isn't exactly
the most honest guy in the school either.

02:57.930 --> 02:59.900
Did you get a hand job
from Sara Pearson?

03:00.860 --> 03:01.730
A hundred percent.

03:02.930 --> 03:05.500
I needed to talk
to someone everyone trusts,

03:05.700 --> 03:10.240
specifically, the person most certain
of Dylan's guilt, Ms. Shapiro.

03:11.910 --> 03:14.880
It would be a lot more exciting
if there were some conspiracy...

03:15.880 --> 03:17.310
...but there just isn't one.

03:17.380 --> 03:19.650
I mean,
I've had Dylan in my class for two years,

03:19.720 --> 03:22.990
and his older brother Cooper
before that, and...

03:23.250 --> 03:27.720
I just want you to understand that
from Dylan Maxwell's first day of my class

03:27.790 --> 03:31.590
he's always been more interested
in getting a laugh than an education.

03:45.340 --> 03:46.010
Sorry.

03:46.340 --> 03:47.010
Dylan.

03:47.340 --> 03:48.680
I mean, it was nonstop.

03:48.740 --> 03:52.280
I mean, he was...
He was gluing pennies on the floor.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.280
Dylan.

03:54.350 --> 03:58.290
He'd draw dicks all over the
whiteboard. It was funny the first time.

03:58.350 --> 04:00.790
But after a while,
it was like, "Dude, calm down."

04:07.860 --> 04:09.930
You know as well as I do

04:10.000 --> 04:12.740
that the evidence
against Mr. Maxwell in this case

04:12.800 --> 04:15.700
is not only clear, it's overwhelming.

04:15.770 --> 04:16.940
Another day, another dick.

04:17.670 --> 04:20.440
He painted the cars.
He deleted the footage.

04:21.640 --> 04:22.610
He slashed my tire.

04:23.710 --> 04:25.810
I do believe
there are legitimate arguments

04:25.880 --> 04:26.950
for Dylan's innocence,

04:27.420 --> 04:31.620
but sometimes when I say them out loud,
I realize how dumb I sound.

04:32.350 --> 04:35.320
You're right about all the evidence.
It does look bad for Dylan.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.630
- But what about the ball hairs, the...?
- Excuse me?

04:40.500 --> 04:42.870
The, um... The hairs on the...

04:44.370 --> 04:48.540
On the testi...
The male genitalia of the members.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.710
- You know?
- Yeah, nice save, Peter.

04:51.070 --> 04:54.910
And, uh...
And what about Mackenzie's, uh, testimony

04:54.980 --> 04:57.450
that she was with Dylan
at the time of the vandalism?

04:57.510 --> 05:00.050
Peter, you know as well as I do

05:00.320 --> 05:03.850
that Dylan Maxwell's own friends
didn't even back up that story.

05:03.920 --> 05:08.390
Dylan, uh, says that he lied
about going to, um...

05:09.430 --> 05:11.460
Going to take a, uh...

05:12.660 --> 05:13.960
About going to the bathroom.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.370
Because he was afraid
that his friends would make fun of him

05:17.430 --> 05:19.070
about going to hang out with Mackenzie.

05:19.340 --> 05:21.440
Sweetie,
he was ten minutes away.

05:21.700 --> 05:24.710
He left ten minutes
before the crime was committed.

05:25.710 --> 05:27.480
If this is some sort of coincidence,

05:27.640 --> 05:31.050
then Dylan Maxwell is the unluckiest kid
in the world.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.620
What about
the Kiefer Sutherland call?

05:35.580 --> 05:37.420
What about it, Peter?

05:37.620 --> 05:38.950
It was a prank phone call.

05:39.860 --> 05:41.760
Yes, it's just a prank call.

05:42.660 --> 05:45.660
But if we can prove
that Dylan is the one who made that call,

05:45.930 --> 05:49.470
it's more than just a voicemail,
it's an alibi.

05:50.030 --> 05:51.500
I asked Mr. Janson for it.

05:52.370 --> 05:53.670
He wasn't responsive.

05:53.740 --> 05:55.500
Mrs. Janson, this is Peter Maldonado.

05:55.570 --> 05:58.440
- So, I've been calling his daughter.
- About that voicemail...

05:58.810 --> 06:01.140
This is annoying.
I don't mean to keep bothering you.

06:01.410 --> 06:03.510
It's just important
that I get that voicemail.

06:03.610 --> 06:05.980
If we can get our hands
on that voicemail

06:06.050 --> 06:09.380
and prove that it's Dylan's voice
from Lucas' phone,

06:09.450 --> 06:11.790
then that prank phone call
becomes evidence

06:11.850 --> 06:14.660
that could completely dismantle
the school board's timeline.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.090
It would exonerate Dylan Maxwell.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.130
Yo. So, look, I'm just...

06:19.390 --> 06:24.430
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
about, uh, everything we did to your dad.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.640
It totally wasn't hysterical at all,
or anything like that.

06:29.040 --> 06:34.710
But I just really need one little tape
from your dad's answering machine.

06:35.540 --> 06:38.410
So, if there's any way
you could help me out,

06:38.780 --> 06:41.920
that would be much appreciated.

06:42.890 --> 06:45.990
Um, so, please, do the right thing.

06:47.190 --> 06:50.060
Because, I mean, seriously,
it's starting to get...

06:50.130 --> 06:51.960
It's starting to get really annoying.

06:53.030 --> 06:53.900
So...

06:55.500 --> 06:56.530
Thank you.

06:57.130 --> 07:00.040
But so far,
all we've gotten are dead ends.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.970
That was pretty good till the end there.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.470
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:05.010 --> 07:09.080
Dylan Maxwell is trying to convince you
that I am some sort of villain,

07:09.810 --> 07:11.580
and that's just not who I am.

07:15.750 --> 07:18.190
Erin Shapiro is a see-you-next-Tuesday.

07:20.690 --> 07:25.030
Just because she lives over in Coastal,
she thinks that she's better than us.

07:26.090 --> 07:30.500
You know the kind of people that, like,
they pretend like they're your best friend

07:30.900 --> 07:34.540
but really they're saying horrible,
mean things about your kid?

07:35.240 --> 07:40.040
You know, like, "Oh, he's so... special."

07:40.980 --> 07:44.610
She's a rules person,
and I can appreciate rules.

07:44.680 --> 07:48.680
You tell us the rules,
we'll play by the rules, and Cooper, he...

07:49.590 --> 07:50.520
He couldn't.

07:50.590 --> 07:53.560
And, so, I just think Dylan didn't...

07:54.620 --> 07:55.890
He didn't stand a chance.

07:58.590 --> 07:59.900
No, dude, Dylan was doomed

07:59.960 --> 08:01.900
from the second he walked
into that classroom.

08:02.660 --> 08:06.200
Last name's Maxwell.
Shapiros hate Maxwells.

08:07.270 --> 08:09.710
Man, I spent a lot of time
fucking with that lady.

08:10.710 --> 08:12.270
A lot of time fucking with that lady.

08:12.840 --> 08:16.180
I told him, "Don't take her class.
I already burned that bridge for you."

08:16.250 --> 08:18.950
But he didn't listen, man.
I was like, "Take an elective."

08:19.010 --> 08:22.550
Take gym twice. Take pottery.
I don't care. Anything but Shapiro."

08:23.150 --> 08:26.120
But he didn't listen, you know,
'cause he's a fucking idiot.

08:26.790 --> 08:28.590
Dude, fuck you.

08:28.660 --> 08:32.090
You have to take a foreign language.
I couldn't have taken pottery.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.730
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
What were you saying?

08:34.799 --> 08:36.030
I'm sorry. No, say it again.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.570
I'm not saying that Dylan,
you know, doesn't have

08:41.640 --> 08:45.710
some kinds of troubles with his,
you know, learning.

08:45.770 --> 08:46.880
We had to keep him back.

08:46.940 --> 08:48.980
I mean,
we started him in kindergarten late.

08:50.750 --> 08:51.910
You suck!

08:52.920 --> 08:56.750
And he was just the kind of kid
that would run right into the ocean.

08:56.890 --> 08:59.290
I remember when he was little
and we were at the beach,

08:59.560 --> 09:02.060
I'd be sitting in the beach chair,
he'd run in the water,

09:02.120 --> 09:05.560
and I had to get up and grab him,
before he got knocked down by a wave.

09:05.630 --> 09:08.130
One time I thought,
"Okay, just let him get knocked down,

09:08.200 --> 09:09.900
and see what happens. He'll learn."

09:10.670 --> 09:14.870
And he got knocked down,
and just jumped up, laughing and smiling.

09:16.240 --> 09:20.680
Dylan's mother and I met
on one of those eHarmony type of things.

09:21.080 --> 09:24.650
I originally put "no kids"
as a preference, but, um...

09:25.780 --> 09:28.950
you know, I wasn't getting a lot of bites,
so, um...

09:29.020 --> 09:32.690
I changed that, and a couple weeks later,
Denise messaged me.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.890
You know, I saw that she had kids.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.890
Man, I gotta fart.

09:36.960 --> 09:37.830
And, uh...

09:38.090 --> 09:42.830
But, hey, I... didn't really mind at all.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.800
Yeah. It's nice.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.170
And now...

09:51.340 --> 09:53.180
because of Erin Shapiro...

09:55.180 --> 09:57.380
I really don't know
what's gonna happen to Dylan.

09:58.010 --> 09:59.950
So, it's clear
that the Maxwell family

10:00.020 --> 10:01.880
doesn't speak highly of Ms. Shapiro.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.020
But at school,
her reputation speaks for itself.

10:05.650 --> 10:08.990
Invaluable. What would the school do
without Ms. Shapiro?

10:09.890 --> 10:13.900
Before arriving at Hanover High,
she graduated from UC Santa Cruz,

10:14.030 --> 10:17.970
double majored in education
and psychology, honors in both.

10:19.130 --> 10:23.140
When she arrived at Hanover High,
she was ready to change the world,

10:23.210 --> 10:24.340
or at least the school.

10:25.810 --> 10:27.810
After-school program enrollment went up.

10:27.980 --> 10:29.340
Detentions went down.

10:29.810 --> 10:31.180
It wasn't a coincidence.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.150
It was her.

10:32.210 --> 10:35.080
When you've been at the same school
for a long period of time,

10:35.150 --> 10:37.020
you get used to the way things are.

10:37.090 --> 10:38.920
It takes someone new, someone special,

10:38.990 --> 10:41.060
to show you
how much better things could be.

10:42.060 --> 10:44.790
So, the faculty loves Ms. Shapiro.
That was expected.

10:45.030 --> 10:47.300
But her students evidently
feel the same way.

10:47.360 --> 10:51.270
You know, Ms. Shapiro is...
She's got a heart of gold, you know?

10:51.330 --> 10:55.240
I mean, without her, I probably wouldn't
have been able to play football this year.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.740
You know,
I owe a lot of credit to her for it.

10:58.810 --> 11:01.980
I love her. I love espaÃ±ol.

11:02.040 --> 11:02.940
I love Ms. Shapiro.

11:03.350 --> 11:07.280
She really worries about us.

11:07.980 --> 11:12.250
Not only as her students,
but as individuals.

11:12.850 --> 11:15.860
Actually, so excited
to be able to show you this.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.390
I don't get to share this very often.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.930
So, um, first assignment, right?

11:22.200 --> 11:24.200
And then final exam.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.740
I keep them as a reminder

11:26.800 --> 11:29.070
of how far students come
in my class, so...

11:29.770 --> 11:31.440
This was Nancy Carter.

11:31.710 --> 11:35.710
She sat right there in front,
class of '05.

11:35.780 --> 11:41.880
She studied abroad in Barcelona,
and she sent me a postcard.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.820
Um... This is Dylan's.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.990
Peter... I wanna believe
that I can make a difference

11:52.060 --> 11:53.500
for every single student,

11:53.900 --> 11:58.170
and that even the troublemakers can grow.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.500
I... I tried.

12:02.240 --> 12:06.070
Again, I tried, and tried,
and tried with Mr. Maxwell,

12:06.240 --> 12:09.340
but this is his idea of growth.

12:12.480 --> 12:16.280
Ms. Shapiro
is my favorite teacher.

12:16.380 --> 12:19.190
And this was before lunch time.

12:19.350 --> 12:21.890
Okay. For those of you
who don't go to Hanover...

12:23.390 --> 12:24.890
this was a really big deal.

12:25.530 --> 12:29.330
One of the perks of the 12th grade is that
you can go off campus to get lunch.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.530
It's pretty great,
considering the alternative.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.400
But then the dicks happened,

12:34.470 --> 12:38.140
and with no leads, no suspects,
and no witnesses,

12:38.440 --> 12:41.010
Vice Principal Keene went nuclear.

12:43.910 --> 12:47.350
He called a mandatory senior assembly,
where he did this:

12:47.550 --> 12:50.950
Obscene images on automobiles.

12:51.390 --> 12:52.950
Property destroyed.

12:53.020 --> 12:55.190
Well, maybe you'll think
this is a laugh, too.

12:55.460 --> 13:00.160
Off-campus lunches are done
until further notice.

13:00.230 --> 13:02.500
- This is bullshit.
- And until someone comes forward

13:02.560 --> 13:04.200
with information on the vandal...

13:05.100 --> 13:07.900
- Prom... next to go.
- What?

13:07.970 --> 13:09.200
- No.
- You can't do that.

13:09.270 --> 13:13.910
I mean, losing off-campus lunch was
like my worst nightmare coming to life.

13:14.980 --> 13:20.280
We lost Pizza Hut,
and Jack in the Box, and Taco Bell.

13:20.550 --> 13:21.550
Wendy's.

13:22.320 --> 13:26.990
Like, I'm a sophomore, but I get it.
Like, we look forward to that. It sucks.

13:27.060 --> 13:29.320
The way I see it,
it's not just about lunch.

13:29.390 --> 13:30.530
It's about freedom.

13:30.590 --> 13:34.200
You take away our off-campus lunch,
you take away our freedom.

13:34.260 --> 13:36.530
Who gives a shit about off-campus lunch?

13:39.170 --> 13:40.170
It's called skipping.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.000
What, do you need fucking permission
to leave?

13:43.410 --> 13:45.840
No. You just bounce.

13:45.910 --> 13:48.280
No one came forward
with information,

13:48.380 --> 13:51.050
so, Keene left,
and let everyone sweat it out.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.380
The seniors were certain
they were going to lose prom, as well.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.480
But then Shapiro got involved.

13:56.550 --> 14:00.190
Whoever did the vandalism here
is the bad guy,

14:00.460 --> 14:04.890
not Vice Principal Keene,
not your faculty members.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.260
Don't let whoever did this ruin your year.

14:09.530 --> 14:12.200
If someone knows something,
say something, okay?

14:12.270 --> 14:16.070
You can come to me,
and I'll talk to Vice Principal Keene,

14:16.200 --> 14:19.210
and see what I can do
about getting off-campus lunch back.

14:19.570 --> 14:21.210
Please, do the right thing.

14:21.410 --> 14:23.450
Do this for your classmates.

14:26.920 --> 14:30.920
And the very next morning,
72 hours after the vandalism...

14:31.390 --> 14:33.050
Alex Trimboli reported

14:33.120 --> 14:36.890
that he saw Dylan Maxwell draw the dicks
and flee the scene.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.390
Trimboli didn't see shit.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.460
Because I wasn't fucking there.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.130
Oh, my God. When I see that kid...

14:45.570 --> 14:47.100
I'm gonna fuck that fool up.

14:48.370 --> 14:52.970
I mean, my life is basically over now,
because he lied.

14:54.680 --> 14:55.540
And for what?

14:57.280 --> 14:58.510
What did he get out of that?

15:09.490 --> 15:11.230
Alex really stepped up.

15:11.690 --> 15:15.260
Everyone thought he was kind of a douche,
but that was really big of him.

15:16.630 --> 15:17.570
It was huge, man.

15:17.630 --> 15:19.070
Alex got us back everything.

15:19.130 --> 15:22.700
He got us back Carl's Jr.,
and Wendy's, and In-N-Out,

15:23.070 --> 15:27.340
and Del Taco, and Pollo Loco,
and Pizza Hut, and Domino's.

15:27.410 --> 15:28.510
Even Jersey Mike's...

15:28.580 --> 15:29.580
You get it.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.420
So, Alex,
after your meeting with Ms. Shapiro,

15:34.480 --> 15:37.150
you single-handedly got lunch back
for the senior class.

15:37.720 --> 15:38.590
Yeah.

15:40.190 --> 15:43.660
Would you say that your social
status changed after saving lunch?

15:46.560 --> 15:49.160
I don't really worry
about those kinds of things.

15:49.230 --> 15:52.370
It's not really cool
to worry about popularity.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.740
Did you lie and say you saw Dylan
to raise your social status?

15:58.740 --> 15:59.610
What?

16:00.380 --> 16:01.240
No.

16:01.980 --> 16:03.380
I've always been pretty popular.

16:04.350 --> 16:06.110
Has Alex always been popular?

16:07.250 --> 16:11.220
He only had 124 Instagram followers
before the incident.

16:11.420 --> 16:13.460
He now has 346.

16:14.260 --> 16:16.120
Everyone was
following him after that.

16:16.390 --> 16:17.530
Cool people, too.

16:18.730 --> 16:19.590
He made it.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.230
I would fuck him.

16:27.500 --> 16:30.010
Alex Trimboli
was treated like a hero.

16:30.310 --> 16:34.480
He saved lunch,
with a big assist from Ms. Shapiro.

16:35.780 --> 16:38.180
Every teacher we asked declined to comment

16:38.250 --> 16:40.250
on the timing
of Alex Trimboli's confession,

16:40.450 --> 16:41.480
except for one.

16:42.220 --> 16:44.350
What do you think
of Alex Trimboli's confession?

16:46.190 --> 16:47.560
Okay. I see what you're saying.

16:47.620 --> 16:52.130
You think it's a little... suspicious
that Trimboli only, you know, came forward

16:52.190 --> 16:54.360
after off-campus lunch was canceled?

16:56.260 --> 17:00.270
Here's the thing. Everyone thinks that,
you know, Keene is the bad guy,

17:00.340 --> 17:03.810
and then Shapiro is the savior
who saved off-campus lunch.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.140
...and I'll talk to Vice Principal Keene,

17:06.270 --> 17:09.339
and see what I can do
about getting off-campus lunch back.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.750
Here's what people
don't wanna tell you.

17:11.810 --> 17:16.550
Canceling off-campus lunch...
that was Shapiro's idea.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.119
Yeah.

17:20.390 --> 17:23.060
To be clear,
Mr. Kraz is a teacher,

17:23.490 --> 17:25.730
and he's making an accusation on camera

17:26.130 --> 17:29.560
that one of his colleagues, Ms. Shapiro,
lied to the school.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.070
That she didn't save off-campus lunch,

17:32.170 --> 17:35.340
because canceling it was her idea
in the first place.

17:36.140 --> 17:38.670
If this is reliable, this is big.

17:39.540 --> 17:43.850
Canceling off-campus
lunch... that was Shapiro's idea.

17:46.550 --> 17:47.750
What? What did he say?

17:48.680 --> 17:50.450
That it was all Ms. Shapiro's idea.

17:50.620 --> 17:53.690
She told Keene to cancel lunch,
and that she would play good cop.

17:54.220 --> 17:55.790
She engineered this entire thing.

17:58.590 --> 18:01.200
You have to admit that
that would look good for Dylan.

18:01.260 --> 18:05.470
I'm just saying, I don't know
if we can trust what Kraz says.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.840
I understand Sam's reluctance
to trust Kraz.

18:11.270 --> 18:14.380
As teachers go,
Kraz isn't the most reliable.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.850
He says a lot of things
just to sound cool.

18:17.750 --> 18:21.220
There are teachers in this school...
Most of the teachers in this school

18:21.280 --> 18:23.590
have, like, a strict "no phones" policy.

18:23.650 --> 18:27.520
They catch you on your phone in class,
they're gonna take your phone for the day.

18:27.590 --> 18:30.790
That's pretty much across the board.
Hey, not in my classroom.

18:31.260 --> 18:33.130
My classroom is a safe space.

18:33.630 --> 18:36.630
Come to class...
I mean, pay attention, please.

18:37.170 --> 18:40.700
You know, learn something from me,
and look at me, but not the whole time.

18:41.240 --> 18:44.210
Don't just stare at me
for an hour of your...

18:44.270 --> 18:47.780
Just 25 blank faces just looking at me,

18:47.840 --> 18:50.280
as I'm talking about whatever...
Bay of Pigs.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.650
It's just... Look away for a minute.
Look at your phone. Tweet something.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.650
This is my, uh, "man cave rules."

18:58.320 --> 18:59.820
Ms. Wallace hates that I have this.

18:59.890 --> 19:03.190
Whenever she tells me to take it down,
I'm like, "Look at rule one."

19:04.260 --> 19:05.330
My cave, my rules."

19:05.660 --> 19:07.760
Kraz really wants
to be loved by his students,

19:08.600 --> 19:10.630
and will say anything
to win their affection.

19:11.630 --> 19:12.500
I listen to Drake.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.640
This is from last weekend.
I got the two-weekend pass.

19:16.700 --> 19:17.910
This weekend is Skrillex.

19:18.510 --> 19:22.210
So, yeah, I get it.
I have the students' respect.

19:23.950 --> 19:25.710
With Kraz, there's no filter.

19:26.450 --> 19:28.880
He inserts himself
into places he doesn't belong.

19:29.950 --> 19:33.420
He put out a poll predicting whether
two of his students would break up.

19:34.490 --> 19:36.560
I feel like I saved Annie
and, honestly, Doug.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.630
I feel like I saved Doug
a lot of heartache.

19:38.690 --> 19:40.630
He was gonna get his heart ripped out.

19:41.260 --> 19:45.230
I was like, "Dude, month and a half.
Get out. Don't stay in it too long."

19:45.500 --> 19:46.530
She's too good for you.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.800
"You're not a good-looking
or interesting person."

19:49.940 --> 19:53.640
Needless to say,
he has a bit of a problem with boundaries.

19:53.710 --> 19:54.580
Yeah, baby.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.950
That's why we have to wonder
if whatever he tells us

19:57.210 --> 19:59.280
- is just Kraz trying to be cool.
- YOLO.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.980
The thing about Shapiro,
she has this big reputation in school.

20:03.250 --> 20:06.420
She's like... She's the perfect,
sterling teacher, you know?

20:06.490 --> 20:08.520
She pretty much writes the rule book
herself.

20:08.590 --> 20:11.760
So, she has to kind of find a creative way
around this, you know?

20:11.830 --> 20:12.830
To get what she wants.

20:12.890 --> 20:15.430
So, here's what she does.
She has Keene cancel lunch.

20:15.830 --> 20:17.730
So, Keene's the villain, okay?

20:18.270 --> 20:21.800
Then she comes in and saves the day,
gets lunch back for everybody.

20:21.870 --> 20:23.000
"Thank you, Ms. Shapiro."

20:23.270 --> 20:27.240
She finds a willing snitch
in Alex Trimboli. Perfect.

20:27.310 --> 20:30.580
And then she just steers the testimony
the way she wants it to go.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.750
To get Dylan Maxwell out of the school,
which is what she always wanted.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.690
Mr. Kraz might just be saying
all this stuff to look cool on camera,

20:39.350 --> 20:41.320
but I don't believe he's making it all up.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.760
I think there are kernels of truth
in there.

20:44.290 --> 20:48.760
For example, we know that Ms. Shapiro met
with Alex Trimboli on March 17th,

20:49.360 --> 20:51.400
two days after the vandalism.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.900
Ms. Shapiro asked Alex
to stay after class,

20:55.270 --> 20:59.570
and I thought that was really weird,
heh, 'cause he was great in Spanish.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.040
Okay. I know what you're thinking.

21:04.310 --> 21:05.850
This all seems a little farfetched.

21:06.650 --> 21:08.520
Teachers meet with students all the time

21:08.650 --> 21:10.720
without there
being some massive conspiracy.

21:11.450 --> 21:15.620
A lot of people do mention the fact
that I had a meeting with Ms. Shapiro,

21:15.690 --> 21:18.730
and I told everyone, "Well,
I wanted to talk about Spanish class."

21:18.790 --> 21:20.460
They say, "You do well in Spanish."

21:20.530 --> 21:22.900
Why would you need a meeting
outside the classroom?"

21:23.030 --> 21:24.700
It's just because I love Spanish,

21:25.330 --> 21:28.800
and I have a lot of questions that
we don't, um, bring up in the curriculum,

21:29.000 --> 21:32.970
like Spanish politics, um, Spanish food,
we don't touch on enough.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.480
I'm going to Barcelona with my family
this summer.

21:35.540 --> 21:38.950
I'm excited about that trip, and I wanted
some suggestions on where to stay.

21:40.350 --> 21:44.420
So, it's possible that this March
17th meeting was just about Spanish,

21:44.990 --> 21:49.560
because Shapiro is the last teacher
you'd expect to coerce a student, right?

21:49.820 --> 21:52.390
I really don't wanna get my friend
in trouble, okay?

21:55.330 --> 22:00.670
But she said that Ms. Shapiro coerced her
into saying that Nick Ynez cheated off her

22:00.770 --> 22:04.070
and Nick ended up getting suspended,
so...

22:04.410 --> 22:06.870
That's where you lose me,
'cause that just doesn't sound

22:06.940 --> 22:09.840
like something Ms. Shapiro would do.
I mean, she's tough, but...

22:09.910 --> 22:12.680
Yeah, but she's got that reputation.

22:12.750 --> 22:16.980
But no one else knows this,
except me, and...

22:18.350 --> 22:20.090
You have to tell us
who it is, please.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.090
My friend has a right
to remain anonymous.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.460
I know,
but it would be such a big help to us.

22:24.530 --> 22:26.090
It's literally all I need.

22:26.890 --> 22:28.700
Okay. Well, I can ask her.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.470
But it's up to her
if she wants to talk to you guys.

22:33.770 --> 22:37.440
Well... apparently,
a paper that I turned in

22:37.510 --> 22:40.140
was similar to one
that Nick Ynez turned in. Um...

22:42.010 --> 22:46.110
She thought he cheated off of me,
but... I don't know if he did or not.

22:46.380 --> 22:47.650
I didn't see him do anything,

22:47.720 --> 22:51.720
but she said that
if I didn't say he did it...

22:52.750 --> 22:53.650
that she'd fail me.

22:54.720 --> 22:57.960
And... she kind of made me say
that he did it,

22:58.030 --> 22:59.830
and I don't know what happened, so...

23:01.030 --> 23:02.060
So, she forced you?

23:03.060 --> 23:05.800
She didn't force me,
but she didn't give a lot of options.

23:05.870 --> 23:07.030
I didn't wanna fail, so...

23:07.640 --> 23:10.470
Shapiro has a preconceived notion
about one student,

23:10.710 --> 23:13.410
manufactures evidence against him
using another.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.010
You gotta admit, this sounds familiar.

23:16.680 --> 23:19.710
...if I
didn't say he did it, that she'd fail me.

23:20.410 --> 23:22.850
So, Shapiro forced **** to lie

23:22.920 --> 23:25.190
and say that she saw Nick Ynez cheating
off of her.

23:25.820 --> 23:26.990
Shapiro talks to Alex,

23:27.050 --> 23:30.190
and then Alex suddenly remembers
seeing Dylan in the parking lot.

23:30.990 --> 23:33.130
What if it's the Nick Ynez thing
all over again?

23:33.190 --> 23:35.100
She has a history of doing this.

23:37.770 --> 23:38.630
I don't know.

23:40.640 --> 23:41.970
That's a little farfetched.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.770
It wasn't easy to convince Sam
to come with me to Shapiro's classroom.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.040
She's just about the most powerful teacher
at Hanover,

23:50.750 --> 23:52.480
but I wasn't gonna let that stop me.

23:53.650 --> 23:54.920
I had a few questions ready.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.590
A few softballs, then the big one.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.920
So, corn or flour?

23:59.990 --> 24:03.090
But I was so nervous,
I forgot the softballs.

24:04.060 --> 24:06.130
Did you tell Keene
to cancel off-campus lunch?

24:06.960 --> 24:07.830
Pardon?

24:08.200 --> 24:11.930
We have a source that says that
you told Keene to cancel off-campus lunch,

24:12.030 --> 24:15.140
and then steered Alex Trimboli
into identifying Dylan as the vandal.

24:15.870 --> 24:17.540
I wanted to know if that was true.

24:18.040 --> 24:21.010
Uh, I wouldn't do something like that.

24:21.910 --> 24:24.880
We have a source that says
that you did with Nick Ynez.

24:27.110 --> 24:29.120
So, you're reporting gossip now?

24:30.720 --> 24:32.950
I thought you wanted
to be taken seriously, Peter.

24:33.890 --> 24:36.990
No, Ms. Shapiro,
I wasn't reporting on gossip.

24:37.060 --> 24:39.530
- It was just...
- I've had enough of this. Thank you.

24:40.660 --> 24:44.130
- Ms. Shapiro, I didn't mean to...
- Thank you, Mr. Maldonado.

24:46.570 --> 24:47.240
Come on.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.040
She's playing all of us.

24:50.570 --> 24:54.140
You know who she is?
She's like that guy from Game of Thrones.

24:54.210 --> 24:57.110
Like, who's that...
Like, the bald guy that has no dick.

24:57.280 --> 25:00.920
She's just, like... You know,
she's playing the game. Playing everybody.

25:01.780 --> 25:02.650
That's Shapiro.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.090
Know who I'm talking about?

25:05.150 --> 25:07.020
- You ever seen Game of Thrones?
- No.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.160
- You haven't seen Game of Thrones?
- No.

25:09.790 --> 25:11.090
It's really good, man.

25:11.730 --> 25:13.960
I thought you wanted
to be taken seriously, Peter.

25:14.860 --> 25:17.060
No, Ms. Shapiro. I wasn't...

25:18.530 --> 25:20.000
How would you expect her to react?

25:20.070 --> 25:23.200
That's a huge accusation
you're throwing at her. It proves nothing.

25:23.270 --> 25:25.710
Dude, I'm telling you.
The look in her eyes?

25:26.810 --> 25:29.110
We have to be on to something here.
She's hiding it.

25:29.180 --> 25:32.610
The fact that you're running with a lead
from Kraz is crazy to me.

25:33.050 --> 25:35.120
Kraz is consistently full of shit.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.950
Wanna know a little more dirt on Shapiro?

25:39.590 --> 25:42.660
You know she forced Mr. Runko
to switch offices with her?

25:43.930 --> 25:46.190
Should hear the stuff
Kyle Rafferty says about her.

25:46.260 --> 25:47.630
He thinks she's a monster.

25:48.030 --> 25:50.630
And that's Kyle Rafferty, who's, like...

25:51.270 --> 25:53.200
That dude has, like, roofied people.

25:53.800 --> 25:57.310
Mr. Runko and Coach Rafferty
flatly deny Kraz's claims...

25:57.570 --> 25:58.870
...that they hate Ms. Shapiro.

25:58.940 --> 26:00.170
She's pretty well-respected.

26:00.940 --> 26:02.840
Kraz, not so much.

26:04.150 --> 26:05.910
Mr. Kraz. Yeah, he's...

26:07.250 --> 26:09.180
Don't worry about what he says.

26:09.250 --> 26:12.250
I know the ins and outs of the faculty.
I'm in the teachers'...

26:12.720 --> 26:15.820
You know,
I've lounged in the teachers' lounge.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.590
And Shapiro gets what she wants.

26:18.660 --> 26:23.630
You know that she got $3000 more
than I got from the insurance company

26:23.700 --> 26:26.030
to get the dick sprayed off her car?

26:26.700 --> 26:28.740
Three thousand dollars more than I got.

26:29.300 --> 26:31.110
What's she gonna spend $3000 on?

26:31.710 --> 26:34.080
What, is she gonna buy,
you know, a lifetime supply

26:34.140 --> 26:36.840
for her 56 cats in her basement?

26:37.280 --> 26:38.150
It's pathetic.

26:40.210 --> 26:44.320
Actually think she's married to a doctor.
She has, like, a super nice Mercedes.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.820
Yeah, it's, like, really nice.

26:50.060 --> 26:51.630
That guy's actually super cool.

26:54.060 --> 26:55.100
And I like cats.

26:55.660 --> 26:57.900
I have serious doubts
about Kraz's credibility,

26:58.870 --> 27:03.100
but it did feel odd that Shapiro got
a full $3000 more than Kraz

27:03.270 --> 27:05.970
to repaint her car
and replace her slashed tire.

27:06.410 --> 27:09.280
I can't prove
that Shapiro coerced Alex Trimboli.

27:10.280 --> 27:13.010
But this price disparity,
we can look into that.

27:13.810 --> 27:17.320
Yeah, I did the paint and repairs
on most of the cars...

27:17.390 --> 27:21.290
...with the, um, you know... uh, peckers.

27:23.760 --> 27:26.060
I hear that there's a wide range
of repair costs

27:26.130 --> 27:29.160
between, say, like,
a Jeep Wrangler and a Mercedes.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.270
Oh, yeah, sure. Um, here.

27:31.330 --> 27:35.200
Like, uh... you know, there's, uh...

27:36.100 --> 27:38.140
All right, like this Mercedes here, right?

27:38.210 --> 27:40.140
The Mercedes has got, um...

27:40.740 --> 27:42.980
It's gonna need two coats of paint,
sparkle paint,

27:43.140 --> 27:47.250
which is an expensive application,
as opposed to the Wrangler,

27:47.350 --> 27:52.090
which, you know, is about half the price,
'cause it's not that nice of a car.

27:52.150 --> 27:54.920
So, the Mercedes
is a high-end vehicle with...

27:54.990 --> 27:58.730
It needs two coats of paint.
Plus I had to patch a tire on that one.

27:58.790 --> 28:02.030
So, you know, that's gonna mean
there's gonna be a difference in price.

28:02.100 --> 28:06.030
How do you patch a slashed tire?
I didn't know you could do that.

28:06.100 --> 28:08.240
The tire's not slashed.
There was a nail in it.

28:08.770 --> 28:12.040
I mean, there are nails
all over Southern California.

28:12.110 --> 28:14.980
You see it all the time. To be honest...

28:15.040 --> 28:18.150
...most flat tires come from nails.
When you're driving, be careful.

28:18.210 --> 28:20.980
They get in on an angle,
and they can take up to two weeks,

28:21.050 --> 28:22.820
to know it's there,
'cause it's a slow leak.

28:23.850 --> 28:26.890
So, no, there was no slashed tires.
There was just a hole.

28:30.460 --> 28:34.130
He not only spray-painted my car,
he slashed my tire.

28:34.730 --> 28:37.260
Were any of the other teachers'
tires slashed?

28:37.360 --> 28:38.230
No.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.770
Yours was the only one.

28:39.830 --> 28:41.900
Yes. Mine was the only one.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.970
Ms. Shapiro claims
that Dylan Maxwell had a vendetta.

28:46.110 --> 28:47.370
That he targeted her.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.440
That he slashed her tire.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.050
He didn't, and she knew it.

28:52.850 --> 28:53.510
She lied.

28:53.780 --> 28:56.180
It makes logical sense,
if you have a vendetta

28:56.250 --> 28:58.150
and a limited amount of time,

28:58.850 --> 29:01.360
you would want
to strike your target first, right?

29:02.820 --> 29:06.190
So, you guys know how Ms. Shapiro
said that her tires were slashed?

29:06.260 --> 29:07.130
Yeah.

29:07.230 --> 29:12.300
Well, this invoice right here proves
that it was from a nail, not a slash.

29:12.530 --> 29:13.900
- A what?
- A nail.

29:15.270 --> 29:17.240
- Yo, that means that she...
- She lied.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.910
Fucking heavy, dude.

29:19.970 --> 29:22.280
And she got it back
before the school board hearing.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.880
What? Dude, that's some crazy shit...

29:24.950 --> 29:27.850
- Yo, you, too. Tell him. Tell him.
- Did you see him?

29:28.280 --> 29:31.550
Dylan, you know how Ms. Shapiro said
that her tires were slashed

29:31.820 --> 29:33.350
- on the day of the vandalism?
- Yeah.

29:33.420 --> 29:37.060
Well, I have discovered an invoice
that proves that she ran over a nail.

29:37.420 --> 29:38.830
Her tires were not slashed.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.300
Oh, shit.

29:43.460 --> 29:44.370
Yo.

29:45.270 --> 29:47.000
- Yo, this is huge.
- Yeah.

29:47.940 --> 29:49.170
- Right?
- That's heavy, dude.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.210
- This is big, dude.
- Yeah, dude.

29:51.270 --> 29:54.340
- Yo, the bitch lied, dude.
- Oh, my God.

29:54.980 --> 29:56.240
Yo, so, this means...

29:56.480 --> 29:58.110
She lied and she knew about it.

29:58.180 --> 29:59.980
Oh, my God.

30:00.050 --> 30:02.420
- Fuck Shapiro, man.
- Let's go, dude.

30:02.480 --> 30:03.850
- Yeah.
- That's so big.

30:04.350 --> 30:06.590
Let's go. Let's go.

30:06.990 --> 30:08.520
This is big, Pete.

30:09.160 --> 30:11.990
- Oh, shit. Yo. We could...
- Evidence, dude.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.830
I mean, first of all,
yes, thank you very much.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.430
But, yo, I'm gonna walk into class.
I'm gonna be like this:

30:18.500 --> 30:20.130
I'm gonna walk into class and be like:

30:23.500 --> 30:25.470
Yo, Shapiro, you see this shit?

30:27.440 --> 30:30.950
It's all we need. I'll be back in school.
I'm excited about being back.

30:31.010 --> 30:35.220
Dylan, it's just one piece
of the puzzle. A big one. But one.

30:37.250 --> 30:39.920
But, like, what...?
I mean, so, what else do we need?

30:39.990 --> 30:40.920
I mean, we have...

30:41.490 --> 30:45.560
I mean, Shapiro's lying, so,
like, I obviously didn't draw the dicks.

30:48.330 --> 30:49.560
Still a lot more work to do.

30:53.430 --> 30:56.370
So, what are you saying, Pete?
I'm still expelled?

30:57.100 --> 30:59.010
- Dylan.
- I'm still in the hole for 100K?

30:59.510 --> 31:01.280
- What's different right now?
- Dylan,

31:01.340 --> 31:03.280
when I post this video online...

31:04.040 --> 31:07.210
And what? Five people on YouTube
are gonna think I'm innocent?

31:08.550 --> 31:09.420
Sick.

31:13.150 --> 31:14.020
Man.

31:16.360 --> 31:17.360
- It's...
- Now I'm high.

31:18.390 --> 31:20.490
I just smoked a victory blunt
for no reason,

31:21.130 --> 31:24.130
and now I'm, like, upsettingly high.

31:26.970 --> 31:27.640
Damn.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.510
Dylan couldn't see it,
but this is a big deal.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.310
Everyone has their own version
of the truth.

31:35.580 --> 31:36.940
And it's starting to seem

31:37.010 --> 31:39.150
like the foundation
of the school board's story,

31:39.380 --> 31:41.520
the one that pinned the dicks
on Dylan Maxwell,

31:42.280 --> 31:45.990
is built on a series of presumptions
and outright lies...

31:46.220 --> 31:47.620
perpetrated by Ms. Shapiro.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.490
How does the school board explain that?

31:51.590 --> 31:53.490
The answer is, they don't.

31:58.700 --> 32:01.140
I'm sorry.
Will you excuse me just one moment?

32:01.200 --> 32:02.100
I'll be right back.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.970
Hey, Ms. Shapiro.
Do you mind if I ask you about something?

32:05.040 --> 32:07.010
- I just need to ask you about the...
- Sorry.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.680
Let's meet her by her car.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.520
Maybe Shapiro thinks
that she's doing this

32:18.590 --> 32:20.250
for the betterment of the school.

32:20.450 --> 32:22.160
That she's framing a guilty man.

32:23.320 --> 32:28.400
Either way, we have to make sure
that she knows what we know.

32:31.570 --> 32:34.570
Lauren Davis,
could you please move your car?

32:34.640 --> 32:37.300
Lauren Davis, please, move your car.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.650
- Are you sure we have the right car?
- Yeah.

32:46.180 --> 32:48.320
At least from the photos,
it should be her car.

32:52.150 --> 32:53.390
- Dude, here she comes.
- What?

32:54.050 --> 32:55.160
Oh, shit. Okay.

32:55.690 --> 32:56.990
Wait. What is she doing?

32:58.990 --> 32:59.660
Wait, what's...?

33:00.330 --> 33:01.200
What the...?

33:01.530 --> 33:02.560
- Did you see that?
- Hey.

33:02.630 --> 33:05.670
You can't be here. No students allowed
in the faculty parking lot.

33:05.730 --> 33:06.600
Okay.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.070
Sorry. So sorry, sir.

33:08.570 --> 33:10.140
Get that camera out of here.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.310
Yeah, we will.
We're leaving right now. Thank you.

33:13.610 --> 33:14.710
Good night.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.140
There she is.

33:28.520 --> 33:31.490
- What do you think's going on in her head?
- That we got her.

33:32.660 --> 33:33.530
Oh, shit.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.270
Oh, damn it.

33:44.070 --> 33:45.540
I'm so gonna fail Spanish.
