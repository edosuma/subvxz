WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:02.580
Dre:
Just like our smartphones,

00:02.580 --> 00:05.500
sometimes we humans
need updates, too.

00:05.500 --> 00:06.880
So, I pay all the bills,
and I'm forced

00:06.880 --> 00:09.170
to sit Indian-style
on the floor?

00:09.170 --> 00:10.380
Easy, fella.

00:10.380 --> 00:11.750
It's "criss-cross
applesauce" now.

00:11.750 --> 00:12.750
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.000
Dad, would you like it

00:14.000 --> 00:16.500
if there was some White guy
asking his son

00:16.500 --> 00:18.750
not to wear his hat
"Negro-style"?

00:18.750 --> 00:21.540
Criss-cross applesauce
it is.

00:21.540 --> 00:24.250
Fine.
Move your feet, Negro.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.580
So, I try my best
to stay up to date,

00:32.580 --> 00:34.040
but it doesn't always work out.

00:34.040 --> 00:37.380
I know what we're doing for
Devante's birthday party.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.790
Ha ha!

00:39.790 --> 00:41.620
A water gun fight!

00:41.620 --> 00:43.880
A box of guns, Dre?

00:43.880 --> 00:48.620
We are not having a gun party
for our child's second birthday!

00:48.620 --> 00:50.120
Think about the message
that you're sending!

00:50.120 --> 00:53.540
The message is, "Who wants to
get riddled with fun?!"

00:53.540 --> 00:54.620
Aaah! Aah!

00:54.620 --> 00:56.420
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:56.420 --> 00:57.710
Okay, okay! Oh!

00:57.710 --> 01:00.000
What?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.040
Do you think I would really give
you a loaded water gun, Bow?

01:03.040 --> 01:05.500
I have thought
about this birthday party,

01:05.500 --> 01:06.540
and we've got to
do it right,

01:06.540 --> 01:09.330
and the child-rearing rules
keep changing.

01:09.330 --> 01:09.830
It's tough to keep up!

01:09.830 --> 01:11.880
Oh, hey, um...

01:11.880 --> 01:14.670
I made some homemade
snack bars.
Oh.

01:14.670 --> 01:18.580
Healthy, organic, no gluten,
no dairy, no nuts.

01:18.580 --> 01:21.540
Oh. Hey, did those go
right from the hot oven

01:21.540 --> 01:24.380
into that toxic
plastic container?

01:24.380 --> 01:28.080
Um...no.

01:28.670 --> 01:33.540
Warm plastic leaches toxins
into food.

01:33.540 --> 01:34.670
Did you know that?

01:34.670 --> 01:36.000
I still microwave
Styrofoam,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
so I probably
did not know that.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.830
You know, when the chicken bone
pops through,

01:40.830 --> 01:42.000
that's when I know
it's done.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.830
Well, I've thought about
Devante's birthday party,

01:43.830 --> 01:45.540
and we need to be
more mindful.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.620
And for his party,
we are gonna have

01:47.620 --> 01:49.710
an allergen-safe
environment

01:49.710 --> 01:54.500
with organic face painting
and gender-neutral games.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.710
And pony rides!

01:55.710 --> 01:56.880
Oh, my God...

01:56.880 --> 01:58.710
-You're joking, right?
-What?

01:58.710 --> 02:02.170
Those animals
are so mistreated.

02:02.170 --> 02:02.920
Exactly!

02:02.920 --> 02:05.080
I just saw a doc called
"Parties of Shame,"

02:05.080 --> 02:07.670
and the only thing treated
worse than those ponies

02:07.670 --> 02:09.040
are human clowns.
Mnh-mnh.

02:09.040 --> 02:11.880
But unlike the ponies,
those clowns had a choice.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.080
-Mnh.
-They just made the wrong one.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.040
Look, all this stuff might've
worked 10 or 20 years ago,

02:16.040 --> 02:19.540
but we know better now,
and we need to do better.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.670
Okay, okay, babe,
I hear you.

02:20.670 --> 02:23.000
Okay.
How 'bout a piñata?

02:23.000 --> 02:23.790
Really?!

02:23.790 --> 02:24.920
What's wrong
with a piñata?!

02:24.920 --> 02:27.620
Let's start with the fact that
it's hanging from a tree.

02:27.620 --> 02:28.830
Oh...

02:28.830 --> 02:30.000
Yeah, I guess
I should've caught that.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.540
Plus, many of those piñatas
are unlicensed reproductions

02:33.540 --> 02:34.540
of copyrighted --

02:34.540 --> 02:35.580
You know what? Mnh!

02:35.580 --> 02:36.710
Oh!

02:36.710 --> 02:39.500
Dad, why?!
You know why.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.880
Uh...w-- No, don't.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.960
Take -- Take cover,
sweetheart!

02:42.960 --> 02:44.580
Yeah,
"Boyz n the Hood"-style!
There's no water!

02:44.580 --> 02:46.620
There's no water in it!
"Boyz n the Hood"-style!

02:46.620 --> 02:48.420
Wh--

02:50.880 --> 02:53.750
So, Mom was hitting Dad up
about being more mindful,

02:53.750 --> 02:55.500
and I think she's right.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.580
We could do more,

02:56.580 --> 02:58.790
especially when it comes
to the environment.

02:58.790 --> 03:00.710
But we do a ton
for the environment.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.540
I mean, we're twins.

03:02.540 --> 03:03.620
Instant carpool.

03:03.620 --> 03:04.880
No, we can do better.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.620
We've been riding on that
for a while.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.670
Bingo. Great.

03:07.670 --> 03:09.710
So, our first order
of business

03:09.710 --> 03:13.620
is to wrangle up the most
wasteful person among us.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.670
Grandma!
What the hey?

03:26.670 --> 03:28.620
How did I know
the shower would be on

03:28.620 --> 03:29.670
but you wouldn't be in it?

03:29.670 --> 03:31.960
'Cause Grandma's efficient,
baby.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.540
I'm getting the wrinkles
out of my clothes

03:34.540 --> 03:36.080
and skin at the same time.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.880
It's definitely working
on the clothes.
Whoa.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.710
Okay, that sharp tongue
of yours

03:40.710 --> 03:43.620
is gonna serve you well
in hell, baby girl.

03:43.620 --> 03:46.960
And anyway, I can only brush
my teeth in humidity.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.790
I've got what dentists call
"fool's enamel."

03:50.790 --> 03:51.830
Come on, Grandma,
you gotta start

03:51.830 --> 03:53.540
thinking about
the environment.

03:53.540 --> 03:54.790
Yeah, get on board.

03:54.790 --> 03:56.750
You kids got it all wrong.

03:56.750 --> 03:59.580
Letting a little water run
is fine

03:59.580 --> 04:02.620
if the reward you seek
is not of this world.

04:02.620 --> 04:05.380
You see, there's nothing
to recycle in heaven.

04:05.380 --> 04:07.380
Eh?

04:07.380 --> 04:08.710
Now get out of here.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.620
I floss in the nude.

04:10.620 --> 04:11.830
That's right!
Go on! Get out!
Oh! Get --

04:11.830 --> 04:14.750
The hell outta here. Go on!
Talking all that crap.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.330
Uh-oh.

04:17.330 --> 04:18.920
Okay, what's wrong, Dre?

04:18.920 --> 04:21.790
Is the vending machine
all out of sunflower seeds?

04:21.790 --> 04:23.710
Okay, so, then,
you do know.

04:23.710 --> 04:25.750
We're having
Devante's birthday party,

04:25.750 --> 04:27.880
and I want ponies
and water guns,

04:27.880 --> 04:30.460
but Bow says
I'm not being mindful.

04:30.460 --> 04:31.580
-Ohh.
-Mnh.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.460
Suddenly, everything I love
is a problem.

04:33.460 --> 04:34.620
Tell me about it.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.460
Do you remember bum fights?

04:36.460 --> 04:37.880
God, they were so much fun.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.750
Now you can't call 'em "bums,"
and you can't make 'em fight.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.960
Hey, you know what?
There are land mines everywhere.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.830
A rug can be called
"Oriental,"

04:45.830 --> 04:46.920
but that can't be
your preference

04:46.920 --> 04:48.880
on your dating profile,
believe you me.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.790
And can someone
tell me this --

04:50.790 --> 04:54.120
when it did become
not okay to kick birds?

04:55.380 --> 04:56.620
That -- That long, huh?

04:56.620 --> 05:00.000
Look, guys, there's a lot
of upside to being mindful,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.380
but, damn it, it seems as if
they keep moving the goal line.

05:04.380 --> 05:05.620
Mm-hmm.

05:05.620 --> 05:08.080
Like there's a secret society
who decides

05:08.080 --> 05:11.670
what is and isn't appropriate
for all of us.

05:11.670 --> 05:13.540
Yeah.
Secret society?

05:13.540 --> 05:15.380
W-W-Who's in
a secret society?

05:15.380 --> 05:16.500
Not me.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.790
And hell, nah,
we don't call ourselves

05:17.790 --> 05:19.500
Illuminaughty By Nature.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.750
What?

05:20.750 --> 05:22.080
Stevens:
Look, Dre, face it, okay?

05:22.080 --> 05:25.620
The moral high horse that
society is riding these days,

05:25.620 --> 05:28.790
well, it is trampling over
everything we love.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.620
And the minute
they take it away,

05:30.620 --> 05:33.380
oho, it is gone forever.

05:33.380 --> 05:34.420
So what do I do?

05:34.420 --> 05:35.620
You fight it, Dre.

05:35.620 --> 05:37.830
Come on, have the party
you want to have.

05:37.830 --> 05:39.540
You want to shoot ponies?

05:39.540 --> 05:40.750
Go ahead, shoot ponies.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.540
We aren't shooting ponies!

05:43.540 --> 05:45.620
So they already
got to you, huh?

05:48.790 --> 05:50.540
Bow, we need to talk.

05:50.540 --> 05:51.830
Hi, Dre.
Hi.

05:51.830 --> 05:54.040
Uh, look, baby,
we need to stand tall

05:54.040 --> 05:57.830
and fight for everything that
our kids enjoy -- classics.

05:57.830 --> 05:59.880
All right, we cannot
let the PC Police

05:59.880 --> 06:01.540
take everything
away from us.

06:01.540 --> 06:03.460
So I'm giving you
two choices

06:03.460 --> 06:05.290
for Devante's
birthday party --

06:05.290 --> 06:06.460
ponies...

06:06.460 --> 06:08.120
or water guns
and ponies.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.620
Okay, I understand that this
is important to you, Dre,

06:11.620 --> 06:12.750
but what is important to me

06:12.750 --> 06:15.710
is that I can make adjustments
and be mindful.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.620
And I get it --
I'm a good person,

06:17.620 --> 06:19.540
but can we maybe
pick this up later?

06:19.540 --> 06:20.790
Is that cool? All right?

06:20.790 --> 06:22.000
And you're making me
lose count.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.670
Okay. That's cool.
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

06:27.460 --> 06:28.880
Baby?
28, 29, 30. Yes.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.380
Did you just call me
a bad person?

06:33.330 --> 06:35.170
Yeah. I did.

06:39.420 --> 06:41.040
Just because I think
our son would like

06:41.040 --> 06:42.920
a little water fight and
a couple of ponies at his party

06:42.920 --> 06:45.580
does not make me
a bad person.

06:45.580 --> 06:48.710
Okay, I'd be lying if I said

06:48.710 --> 06:52.620
I wasn't baffled by some
of the things that you still do.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.710
Like what?

06:53.710 --> 06:58.330
You still listen
to "Ain't No Fun."

06:58.330 --> 07:00.380
It's a jam.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.750
It's misogynist.

07:01.750 --> 07:05.460
It's about friends
and sharing!

07:05.460 --> 07:08.040
Think about the chorus.

07:09.790 --> 07:12.540
Oh...
Yeah.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.920
It's, uh...it's
just about sharing.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.790
And it's not just
about music, babe --

07:16.790 --> 07:18.620
it's your whole approach
to life.

07:18.620 --> 07:22.710
I mean, you are not mindful
of how things impact others

07:22.710 --> 07:24.710
unless they directly
affect you.

07:24.710 --> 07:29.540
Name an instance where I put
myself ahead of others.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.790
What's so funny?

07:35.790 --> 07:37.620
You want me to name one?

07:37.620 --> 07:39.670
Yeah, that's about 50 pounds.

07:39.670 --> 07:40.670
Okay.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.380
Back to Sexy Dre.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.500
I didn't come up
with "Sexy Dre."

07:45.500 --> 07:47.000
The streets did!
Okay, fine!

07:47.000 --> 07:48.880
How about the fact that,
when we go out to eat,

07:48.880 --> 07:51.880
you never want to do
farm-to-table.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.580
'Cause I don't care
about the biography

07:53.580 --> 07:54.880
of a carrot
before I eat it.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.750
I know that you sneak-watch
"The Cosby Show"

07:58.750 --> 07:59.960
in the middle of the night.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.880
I only laugh at Rudy.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.620
Everything you're
calling me out for

08:03.620 --> 08:06.580
is what contributed
to who I am today.

08:06.580 --> 08:08.670
Ohh...you know what?

08:08.670 --> 08:10.420
What?

08:10.420 --> 08:11.500
You're right.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.670
Ohh, sweetheart.

08:12.670 --> 08:14.620
What?
I know it's hard for you.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.790
Are you saying
you're better than me, Bow?

08:19.790 --> 08:21.750
Well.
Well, for someone
who claims

08:21.750 --> 08:23.040
to love animals
as much as you do,

08:23.040 --> 08:27.620
you're serving an awful lot
of steak at Devante's party.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.880
I only buy level-five,

08:29.880 --> 08:33.750
grass-fed,
hormone-free beef.

08:33.750 --> 08:34.960
Those are happy cows.

08:34.960 --> 08:39.330
Yeah, happy until they get
a bolt in the brain.

08:39.330 --> 08:41.790
Fine. I'll be vegan.

08:41.790 --> 08:43.540
It's no problem.

08:43.540 --> 08:45.670
Okay.

08:45.670 --> 08:47.460
What about those diamonds?

08:47.460 --> 08:48.540
Hmm?

08:48.540 --> 08:49.880
What about them?

08:49.880 --> 08:54.330
Lives were lost
for those blood diamonds.

08:54.330 --> 08:56.380
Rent a movie.

08:56.380 --> 08:58.420
"It's not bling-bling.

08:58.420 --> 09:00.330
It's bling bang."

09:02.500 --> 09:04.500
Then I won't
wear them anymore.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.500
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.830
Well, it's easy
not to wear earrings.

09:09.830 --> 09:14.670
Why don't we do something
that requires real sacrifice?

09:14.670 --> 09:18.620
Like that luxury SUV
that seats eight

09:18.620 --> 09:21.710
but only drives one
most of the time.

09:21.710 --> 09:23.540
I'll take the bus!

09:23.540 --> 09:24.790
Stop talking crazy, Bow,

09:24.790 --> 09:26.880
and just admit that
I'm not a bad person,

09:26.880 --> 09:28.960
and you're not as good
as you say that you are.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.040
All right, and let's go
order some steak

09:30.040 --> 09:32.670
with some diamonds on top.
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah-ah!

09:32.670 --> 09:35.710
The sign of
a good person, Dre,

09:35.710 --> 09:38.670
is that you are willing
to do better,

09:38.670 --> 09:41.670
and I want to do better.

09:41.670 --> 09:45.420
You won't survive
on the bus.

09:45.420 --> 09:47.460
Game on!

09:47.460 --> 09:48.750
I'm-a get a monthly pass.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.670
Do you know why?

09:50.670 --> 09:52.460
Because I...

09:54.380 --> 09:56.330
Uh...

09:56.330 --> 09:58.210
...am a good person.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.710
Hey, kids!

10:04.710 --> 10:07.250
Come on over here
and give Grandma a hand.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.040
Come on.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.830
Grandma, how come you didn't use
the bags that we gave you?

10:10.830 --> 10:13.710
Yeah. Science shows that
those reusable totes

10:13.710 --> 10:14.960
are better for
the environment.

10:14.960 --> 10:19.710
Unh-unh. I found an onion skin
in one -- threw 'em all away.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.670
Contamination!

10:21.670 --> 10:24.000
Did you individually bag
bananas?

10:24.000 --> 10:27.380
Oh, baby, when they touch,
they go bad.

10:27.380 --> 10:28.120
There's your science.

10:28.120 --> 10:31.540
Well, can you at least save them
so you can reuse them?

10:31.540 --> 10:33.620
Oh, baby, I save 'em already!

10:33.620 --> 10:36.170
Look at this.
See?

10:36.920 --> 10:38.960
Grandma, that is horrible,
even for you!

10:38.960 --> 10:42.250
You can't possibly
keep all these bags!

10:42.250 --> 10:42.920
You hear that, kids?

10:42.920 --> 10:46.830
Mr. Environmental wants me to
dump them in a landfill.

10:46.830 --> 10:48.830
I'll get rid of them
the right way --

10:48.830 --> 10:51.670
with an old-fashioned
trash fire.

10:51.670 --> 10:53.620
Diane,
go get my burn barrel.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.710
You had it last.

10:54.710 --> 10:57.540
Grandma, no.
You'll release greenhouse gases.

10:57.540 --> 10:59.710
And that melts
the polar ice caps.

10:59.710 --> 11:01.540
Tell her, Diane.

11:01.540 --> 11:02.750
I don't know.

11:02.750 --> 11:07.500
I love polar bears, but I also
love a big, stanky fire.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.460
Diane, no...

11:09.460 --> 11:10.830
That's right, baby.

11:10.830 --> 11:13.580
Burn what needs
to be burned.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.830
Yeah.
Mm.

11:15.830 --> 11:18.880
So, Bow had been living
mindfully for a week.

11:18.880 --> 11:23.670
I kept waiting for her to
crumble, but she was all in.

11:23.670 --> 11:24.790
You know, Dre?
Hmm?

11:24.790 --> 11:26.830
I don't even miss
my diamonds.

11:26.830 --> 11:29.670
And everyone at work
loved my vegan chili...

11:29.670 --> 11:32.500
...and you were wrong
about the bus.

11:34.670 --> 11:35.750
How's that book, Bow?

11:35.750 --> 11:37.290
The reviews are great.

11:37.290 --> 11:38.540
Oh! Oh.

11:38.540 --> 11:39.960
Um, it's really good,
Tonya.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.170
Yeah, uh, you can borrow it
when I'm done.

11:42.170 --> 11:42.830
That would be amazing.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.750
Just like
our public transit system.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.460
Amazing.

11:46.460 --> 11:47.500
Yeah. Right?

11:47.500 --> 11:48.710
Making all these
adjustments

11:48.710 --> 11:51.380
has made me feel
like I'm doing my part.

11:51.380 --> 11:52.750
I see it, too...
Hmm.

11:52.750 --> 11:55.790
...and I think you
deserve a reward

11:55.790 --> 11:57.620
for being such
a good person.

11:57.620 --> 11:58.670
Oh, no, no, no.

11:58.670 --> 11:59.960
You can't tempt me --

11:59.960 --> 12:04.290
not with burgers
or steaks or...

12:04.290 --> 12:05.500
Voilà!

12:05.500 --> 12:07.580
Feast your eyes.

12:07.580 --> 12:08.710
Mm-hmm.

12:08.710 --> 12:11.210
Smell it. Mmm.

12:18.710 --> 12:19.710
Conflict-free?

12:19.710 --> 12:22.500
No...much conflict.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.380
Inner conflict.

12:24.380 --> 12:27.460
Should I go huge or huger?

12:29.750 --> 12:32.830
I hope you kept your receipt,
Dre, because Mama is clean now.

12:32.830 --> 12:35.960
I...
And I need to go
finish reading my book

12:35.960 --> 12:38.620
so that I can give it
to my bus buddy.

12:38.620 --> 12:40.040
Hold on, b-babe, babe.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.750
You mean, you really weren't
doing all of this

12:42.750 --> 12:44.000
just to make me look bad?

12:44.000 --> 12:47.670
I am not, Dre, and you should
try being a good person, too.

12:47.670 --> 12:50.210
It's not that hard.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.380
Make that change.

12:59.880 --> 13:03.380
Even though
this man in the mirror was fly,

13:03.380 --> 13:04.120
Bow had me thinking.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.880
If she wasn't going to
come down to my level,

13:06.880 --> 13:10.750
maybe I needed to come up to
hers and be more mindful --

13:10.750 --> 13:14.080
like by donating my unmindful
things to charity.

13:14.080 --> 13:19.460
These were made in a sweatshop,
probably by children.

13:19.460 --> 13:20.880
Real wolf fur.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.790
Likely a mom and her cubs
taken while sleeping.

13:24.790 --> 13:28.620
It was so in that year,
but so wrong.

13:28.620 --> 13:30.500
My belt budget alone
could build

13:30.500 --> 13:31.920
a girls' school in Africa.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.380
And now that I was seeing
the world in a different way,

13:35.380 --> 13:36.710
I couldn't turn it off.

13:36.710 --> 13:40.000
For example,
Tony is no longer a Latino --

13:40.000 --> 13:42.790
he's a member of
the Latinx community.

13:42.790 --> 13:45.460
And I'm learning
to speak Latinx.

13:45.460 --> 13:48.540
Holax, Tony.
Buenos Diax.

13:48.540 --> 13:49.830
I think that was right.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.620
I even had to see my lunch
in a different way.

13:52.620 --> 13:54.880
I was excited about
eating mindfully.

13:54.880 --> 13:57.500
Whoa. How did you
have them cook that,

13:57.500 --> 13:58.580
medium-green?

13:59.830 --> 14:02.710
Guys, I'm happy
with my salad.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.000
Are you sure you're
not sick, Dre?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.750
Hmm?
Because that looks like
the lunch of someone

14:06.750 --> 14:09.500
who found out he's gonna die
if he doesn't make changes.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.580
Ooh! One rib left.

14:12.580 --> 14:14.540
Splitsies?
Oh, absolutely.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.710
Mmm.

14:15.710 --> 14:17.880
Mmm. Mmm.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.790
Of course, it was a struggle
to stay mindful,

14:20.790 --> 14:23.960
and I nearly fell off
the wagon that night.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.420
Man: Welcome to Pauly's Burgers.
What can I get you?

14:26.420 --> 14:28.120
Yeah...

14:29.580 --> 14:31.580
Never mind.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.920
I can't do it.

14:38.620 --> 14:41.290
Oh, no, you didn't.

14:45.830 --> 14:47.670
Dre: Hey! Hey!

14:47.670 --> 14:49.250
Hey.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.540
I see you.

14:50.540 --> 14:51.880
I see you!

14:51.880 --> 14:55.500
And...were you just listening
to "Ain't No Fun"?

14:55.500 --> 14:56.620
Huh?!

14:56.620 --> 15:00.620
The least mindful song
in the history of hip-hop?!

15:00.620 --> 15:01.710
What?!

15:01.710 --> 15:03.670
That's corrupt!
You hypocrite!

15:03.670 --> 15:06.120
I know!
I...

15:09.250 --> 15:11.500
I know "Ain't No Fun"
is wrong,

15:11.500 --> 15:13.920
but you were right --
it's a jam.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.620
And it was my jam
all through med school,

15:16.620 --> 15:17.710
and I can't take that back.

15:17.710 --> 15:20.880
You guilted me into
donating my wolf coat.

15:20.880 --> 15:24.540
Wh--
And now my fox scarf
looks silly.

15:24.540 --> 15:25.920
It always looked silly,
didn't it?

15:25.920 --> 15:29.750
I ate salad for lunch
on rib day.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:29.750 --> 15:33.250
Now, was this mindfulness
just a lie?

15:33.250 --> 15:34.420
No!

15:34.420 --> 15:35.830
I tried!

15:35.830 --> 15:37.880
And I -- It was all
going really well,

15:37.880 --> 15:39.500
and then, I-I don't know,
I just --

15:39.500 --> 15:42.040
I...fell off the rails today.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.000
Bow:
Sure, not wearing my diamond
ring made some things easier,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.540
but it also made
some things creepier.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.040
Single, huh?
Oh, uh.

15:50.040 --> 15:54.710
Once they take this catheter
out, why don't I take you out?

15:55.920 --> 15:58.580
It turns out they were lying
about loving my chili.

15:58.580 --> 16:00.170
Ah!

16:03.830 --> 16:07.330
And even the bus
stopped working for me.

16:07.330 --> 16:09.420
Here you go. Enjoy.

16:09.420 --> 16:10.540
Thank you!

16:14.330 --> 16:15.920
I knew it.

16:15.920 --> 16:19.420
Bow, just admit --
You are no better than me.

16:20.460 --> 16:22.540
I'm not.

16:22.540 --> 16:23.790
We're both terrible people.

16:23.790 --> 16:25.620
Well, speak for yourself.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.960
Do whatever you want
for Devante's birthday party.

16:27.960 --> 16:31.750
I don't -- I don't have
a leg to stand on.

16:33.670 --> 16:35.210
What?

16:35.210 --> 16:36.620
I-I...

16:45.540 --> 16:46.670
Got to hold it?
Yep.

16:46.670 --> 16:49.420
There we go.
Uhhh...

16:49.420 --> 16:50.880
Together:
Ooh!

16:50.880 --> 16:54.620
This is gonna save us literally
hundreds of gallons a year.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.750
Aww...
That's nice.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.620
You guys finally found
the perfect thing

16:58.620 --> 16:59.960
to put all your ideas in.

16:59.960 --> 17:04.330
Jack, you want to come with us
to test-drive an Escalade

17:04.330 --> 17:05.540
tonight after dinner?

17:05.540 --> 17:07.790
I'm starting to think
I need more elbow room

17:07.790 --> 17:10.500
and off-roading
capabilities.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.710
Off-- Off-roading?
Mm.

17:11.710 --> 17:14.500
Grandma, that car gets
like 14 miles per gallon.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.750
Jack, after 400 years
of suffering,

17:17.750 --> 17:19.880
don't you think Black people
have a right

17:19.880 --> 17:22.830
to enjoy the fruits
of their labor?

17:22.830 --> 17:25.000
And now we're supposed
to spend more time

17:25.000 --> 17:27.080
cleaning up messes
we didn't make?

17:27.080 --> 17:32.330
Does that sound right to you...
as a strong Black man?

17:32.330 --> 17:33.580
Say no more.

17:33.580 --> 17:36.500
Sorry, Junior, but this
strong Black man's

17:36.500 --> 17:37.620
going with his grandma.

17:37.620 --> 17:38.790
Let's ride dirty.
Mm-hmm.

17:38.790 --> 17:41.580
For my brothas!
That's it, baby!

17:41.580 --> 17:42.750
Oh, hey, Grandma.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.580
On our way there,
can we both litter?

17:44.580 --> 17:48.120
Oh...absolutely.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.790
Ha! And then there was one.

17:51.790 --> 17:53.580
Hey, babe?
Man on TV: ...will return
after these messages.

17:56.460 --> 17:58.540
What were you watching?

17:58.540 --> 17:59.750
"Sixteen Candles."

17:59.750 --> 18:02.710
Oh, you mean the movie...
Ohh.

18:02.710 --> 18:04.670
...where they play the gong

18:04.670 --> 18:07.670
every time
the Asian character enters?

18:07.670 --> 18:08.880
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.830
And that other guy just gave
his drunk girlfriend to a nerd.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.830
It's horrible!

18:14.830 --> 18:18.460
I loved this movie
when I was a kid.

18:18.460 --> 18:19.750
It was the first time
I saw a story

18:19.750 --> 18:22.880
about an awkward teenage girl
that was like me.
Oh.

18:22.880 --> 18:26.330
I just don't feel ready
to give it up.

18:26.330 --> 18:28.540
Ugh! I'm a monster!

18:28.540 --> 18:31.540
Hey, hey, hey, babe.
Mnh?

18:31.540 --> 18:32.880
I hate this.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.880
I just wanted to
knock you down a peg.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.290
I didn't -- I didn't
mean to break you.

18:39.540 --> 18:40.830
You didn't break me.

18:40.830 --> 18:44.960
It was that mom at the park
talking about plastic.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.040
And the thought of all those
parents coming over here

18:47.040 --> 18:50.000
to Devante's birthday party
and judging me

18:50.000 --> 18:52.750
because of the water pistols
and the ponies.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.330
So you know what I did?

18:54.330 --> 18:55.920
I judged you.
Hmm.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.830
I made you feel bad
to make myself feel better,

18:58.830 --> 19:03.460
and for that...
I am sorry, my husband.

19:03.460 --> 19:04.580
I am sorry.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.670
You know what, my wife?

19:06.670 --> 19:08.620
You're still a better person
than me.

19:08.620 --> 19:10.670
You don't have
to say that.
No, it's true, babe.

19:10.670 --> 19:12.960
You are the moral compass
of our family,

19:12.960 --> 19:16.790
and I need you to be that for
all of us, especially for me.

19:16.790 --> 19:18.460
It's why we work.

19:24.750 --> 19:29.540
So you're saying that even
if I drive my big truck to work,

19:29.540 --> 19:30.710
I'm still better than you?

19:30.710 --> 19:32.750
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

19:32.750 --> 19:33.880
What if I go
to the drive-thru

19:33.880 --> 19:36.250
and order something
with bacon on it?

19:36.250 --> 19:36.920
Still better.

19:36.920 --> 19:40.710
What if I swerve close
to a cyclist just to scare them?

19:40.710 --> 19:42.670
Now you're getting
on my level.

19:42.670 --> 19:44.330
Seriously?
Yeah.

19:44.330 --> 19:45.460
I've done it a few times.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.620
Ruby:
That was the best.

19:51.620 --> 19:52.920
We had to stop
for gas three times.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.790
Yeah. The coolest part
was passing by

19:54.790 --> 19:57.540
all those people we could've
picked up but didn't.

19:57.540 --> 19:59.620
Living our best lives,
huh, baby?

19:59.620 --> 20:01.790
Mm-hmm.
If it were up to Junior,

20:01.790 --> 20:04.790
he would have us get out
and push our way home.

20:04.790 --> 20:07.540
You know what?
I'm out, Grandma.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.710
You win.

20:08.710 --> 20:11.620
No one is gonna
change your mind.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.790
And maybe you're right.

20:12.790 --> 20:15.790
Maybe I should start
living like you --

20:15.790 --> 20:18.750
in the moment
with no concern

20:18.750 --> 20:21.580
for the next generation's
future.

20:21.580 --> 20:24.250
Here.
Keep an eye on your grandson.

20:24.250 --> 20:24.960
Come on, guys,

20:24.960 --> 20:28.330
let's go throw some batteries
in the regular trash!

20:33.460 --> 20:35.250
That guy, huh?

20:36.290 --> 20:37.420
Ooh.

20:38.420 --> 20:40.120
Don't look at me like that.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.790
Of course
I want a nice planet

20:42.790 --> 20:44.620
for the next generation
to live on,

20:44.620 --> 20:49.790
but don't I deserve to enjoy
my hard-earned freedoms?

20:49.790 --> 20:53.420
Ohh...you got me there, now.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.580
I'm being selfish.

20:55.580 --> 20:57.580
Okay, Devante.

20:57.580 --> 20:59.080
I'm gonna do better for you.

20:59.080 --> 21:02.960
I'm gonna even start turning
my car off when I get home.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.620
I don't need the heater
running all night.

21:05.620 --> 21:07.670
But I can take those
five minutes

21:07.670 --> 21:09.500
and warm it up
in the morning.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.620
How 'bout that?

21:10.620 --> 21:12.830
What about the plastic bags,

21:12.830 --> 21:14.580
Grandma Ruby?

21:14.580 --> 21:16.710
Don't push it, Junior!
