After the Berlin Wall fell
our records started selling

03:17.490 --> 03:19.050

of the Iron Curtain,

and naturally that gave
us a boost.

We're very big in Bulgaria,
and what's-his-name? The other
garia.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.100
Hungaria?
Yeah, whatever.

03:26.170 --> 03:27.270

of Communism than us.

03:30.670 --> 03:32.900
Maybe the people who
actually live in the
communist countries.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.850
Oh yeah, I hadn't
thought of that.
I bet you're right.

03:35.910 --> 03:38.520
On the other hand,
each of us just bought
our own soccer team.

of promos for us?

03:54.400 --> 03:55.430
Like what?

03:55.500 --> 03:56.800
Maybe you could say

03:56.870 --> 03:59.840
"Nobody rocks
like Bill and Marty on KBBL."

03:59.900 --> 04:00.970
We don't know that,

If he's really interested
in being a musician

maybe we should
buy him a guitar.

20:05.780 --> 20:08.480
I've been tried as one, but...

20:08.550 --> 20:10.050
I'll do it.

20:10.120 --> 20:15.160
"Alcohol increases
your ability to drive."

20:15.230 --> 20:16.230
False?!

20:16.290 --> 20:17.150
Oh, man!

20:18.800 --> 20:21.840
I don't know about this,
Bart dude.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.240
Your Dad is right.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.170
I <i>am a bum.</i>

20:24.240 --> 20:25.270
He didn't call you a bum.

20:25.340 --> 20:26.510
He called you a sponge.

20:26.570 --> 20:28.840
Sponge?!

20:28.910 --> 20:30.180
( <i>grunting )</i>

20:30.240 --> 20:33.150
Does this look like something
a sponge would do?!

20:33.210 --> 20:34.310
I'll show him

20:34.380 --> 20:37.020
who's a sponge.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.520
Well, if it isn't
Wee Willy Washout.

20:40.590 --> 20:42.420
I want to take
the test again.
Why?

20:42.490 --> 20:44.220
So I can staple
my license

20:44.290 --> 20:46.530
to Homer Simpson's
big bald head!

20:46.590 --> 20:50.130
Really? Well, here's
your written test.

20:50.190 --> 20:51.860
I'll get you started.

20:51.930 --> 20:53.900
"B," "C," "D,"
"A," "B..."

20:55.800 --> 20:59.710
Homer had a piece of food
on his face for three days.

20:59.770 --> 21:00.840
( <i>laughing )</i>

21:00.910 --> 21:02.480
It wasn't little either.

21:02.540 --> 21:04.440
It was a chicken wing.

21:04.510 --> 21:06.050
( <i>hysterically: )
Wing!</i>

21:06.110 --> 21:07.280
Ooh, what was that?

21:07.350 --> 21:08.350
It doesn't matter.

21:08.410 --> 21:10.240
Let's get some margaritas.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.210
I'm buying.

21:16.490 --> 21:17.720
Otto!

21:17.790 --> 21:19.890
That's what
my driver's license says.

21:23.190 --> 21:26.490
Kids:
♪ <i>Hail to the bus driver,
bus driver, bus driver... ♪</i>

21:26.560 --> 21:30.760
Yes, hail to the bus driver

21:30.840 --> 21:34.170
bus driver man.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.280
