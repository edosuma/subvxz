WEBVTT

00:03.071 --> 00:04.638
Operation Willoughby is a go.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.107
McGEE:
Our target is Kai Chen.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.109
Wealthy businessman
suspected of committing

00:08.142 --> 00:10.411
acts of terror to manipulate
the stock market.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.180
I don't understand.
What's the catch here?

00:12.213 --> 00:13.381
Reeves will be stuck
on a plane

00:13.414 --> 00:15.083
with a bunch of guys
who want to kill him.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.151
Sitrep.
Reeves and Jintao
have entered the plane,

00:17.185 --> 00:19.120
along with the pilot.
He's exiting the plane.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.621
Damn it, he knows.
Call the tower.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.190
Tell 'em to give Reeves
the abort code.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.492
Get him out of there now!

00:24.525 --> 00:27.095
GIBBS:
Chen knows that you're alive and
you could be a target, Reeves.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.162
You need to lay low.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.264
Qasim, these conversations
you've been listening to,

00:30.298 --> 00:32.666
they're about a terrorist
we've been tracking for months.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.502
Your work could be
the key to stopping him.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.204
You know you're
doing great, right?

00:36.237 --> 00:37.638
Thank you.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.512
The doctors managed
to stop the bleeding,

00:44.545 --> 00:46.114
but Qasim was

00:46.147 --> 00:47.515
without oxygen for too long.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.284
Last recording Qasim was
supposed to translate.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.586
Why are you
giving this to me?
I don't know your reason,

00:52.620 --> 00:55.189
but I know you're willing
to do anything to get Chen.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.159
So am I.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.166
Want me to
freshen that, Gibbs?

01:05.199 --> 01:06.567
Mm. I'm good, Elaine.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.169
MAN: Yo!

01:08.202 --> 01:09.870
Anytime today will be fine.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.240
Be right there.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.209
MAN: Yeah.
Crazy morning.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.878
Darlene called in sick.
I'll get you a cup to go.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.281
No rush.
Take your time.

01:28.256 --> 01:31.125
MAN: Ah, so your
vacation's over?

01:31.159 --> 01:33.527
Sorry it took so long.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.730
Yeah, I ordered
wheat bread.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.199
Give me a minute.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.556
You sure you got nothing?
I mean, a half day?

02:02.590 --> 02:03.591
FOREMAN: Sorry, pal.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.240
Hey, Bodie.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.711
Man...

02:25.246 --> 02:28.249
No. I thought you were dead.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.318
(chuckles)

02:30.351 --> 02:31.685
No, that's wishful thinking,
Bubba.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.922
Wishful thinking.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.891
*

03:07.488 --> 03:10.324
(elevator bell dings)

03:14.295 --> 03:15.596
What's that?

03:15.629 --> 03:18.299
A flower arrangement.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.968
Oh, yeah, see, um...
(clears throat)

03:21.001 --> 03:23.771
no frou-frou flowers
around my desk, thanks.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.340
Relax, Fabio,
they're for Bishop.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.976
She had a horrible week.
I mean, the funeral,

03:29.009 --> 03:30.311
and then she had to
clear out Qasim's apartment.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.679
That's a nice thought.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.947
Put my name on the card,
I'll pay for half.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.383
No, they're from me, Nick.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.520
On my way.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.622
I've been summoned
to the British embassy.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.324
Another debriefing
about Willoughby?

03:43.357 --> 03:45.459
MI6 special-op
director's in town

03:45.493 --> 03:46.660
on a fact-finding mission.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.664
(elevator bell dings)

03:51.532 --> 03:53.667
Hey.
Hey.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.371
You good?

03:57.405 --> 03:58.539
I'm fine.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.008
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.045
Hey, um...

04:05.078 --> 04:06.780
any more on Kai Chen?

04:06.814 --> 04:09.650
Gibbs told you
not to get involved.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.619
Qasim's flash drive,
what'd you do with it?

04:11.652 --> 04:14.054
Nothing yet.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.324
I haven't found a translator
I can trust.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.334
How you doing?

04:26.367 --> 04:30.304
I'm fine, really.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.672
These are very pretty.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.006
Yeah, we thought
you'd like them.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.675
Really?

04:39.647 --> 04:42.015
Something's up.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.751
Anyone hear from Gibbs?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.986
He was supposed to teach
an 8:00 field training class.

04:46.019 --> 04:46.987
He never showed.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.356
Uh, it's not like Gibbs

04:48.389 --> 04:49.690
to be late for anything.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.925
He's not answering
his home phone or his cell.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.995
Yeah, that's, uh...
strange.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.864
Find him.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.934
Uh, he usually calls
if he's gonna be late.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.437
Something's wrong.
Or maybe he's doing
something private

05:03.471 --> 05:04.772
that's none
of our business.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.374
Yeah, exactly.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.376
Well, you know what,
we heard the director.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.043
He said we need to find him,
so let's find him.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.879
Quinn, Bishop, you guys
go to Gibbs' house.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.081
Uh, no, I really don't
feel comfortable doing that.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.583
Going into his house
when he's not there?

05:18.619 --> 05:20.454
Torres, you're with me.

05:20.488 --> 05:23.123
Ooh, I like it when you
take charge. Where we going?

05:23.156 --> 05:25.493
Same place Gibbs goes
every morning.

05:27.895 --> 05:31.632
Well, the good news is
his truck isn't here.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.401
Wouldn't want to find
Gibbs in the basement,

05:33.434 --> 05:35.035
a victim of a
power-tool accident.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.970
He doesn't use
power tools.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.572
(sighs)
(doorbell rings)

05:39.740 --> 05:42.443
Door is never locked
when he's home.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.447
I guess it never is.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.648
Gibbs?

05:53.921 --> 05:55.589
It was written at 8:10.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.925
Gibbs has never gotten a parking
ticket before in his life.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.564
QUINN: All right,
well, nothing unusual

06:03.597 --> 06:05.999
in the basement,
besides a boat.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.835
That's not strange.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.137
Bishop, you find
anything upstairs?

06:10.170 --> 06:11.405
Well, I found
something interesting

06:11.439 --> 06:13.474
on the nightstand
in his bedroom.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.842
What?

06:14.875 --> 06:17.678
The Sensitive Man's
Survival Handbook.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.848
No. That's probably
a paperweight.
Uh-uh.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.551
There's a bookmark
on page 351.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.420
Go figure. I didn't see
that one coming.
Mm-hmm.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.823
This is a waste of time.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.158
We're not gonna find anything.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.193
(clang)
Oh, no.

06:33.226 --> 06:37.431
What?
I accidentally hit this
against the faucet.

06:37.465 --> 06:40.200
I'm sure Gibbs has other plates.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.437
No, not like this one.

06:43.471 --> 06:46.707
Looks like his daughter Kelly
made it for him.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.576
Ooh.
(exhales)

06:49.877 --> 06:51.879
Ugh.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.482
Gibbs was in a little
earlier than usual.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.550
Said he was teaching
an 8:00 class.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.886
Did he seem concerned
about anything?
No.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.454
As a matter of fact,
he was a bit

07:00.488 --> 07:02.122
more chatty than usual.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.592
Gibbs?
Leroy Jethro Gibbs?

07:04.625 --> 07:06.494
Mm-hmm.
What was he saying?

07:06.527 --> 07:07.861
I asked him if he wanted me

07:07.895 --> 07:10.197
to top off his coffee,
and he said, "I'm good."

07:10.230 --> 07:11.632
And that's chatty?

07:11.665 --> 07:13.467
For Gibbs,
the bar is low.

07:13.501 --> 07:14.835
He normally responds
with a look.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.170
He also told me

07:17.204 --> 07:19.473
to take my time
with the check.

07:19.507 --> 07:22.676
That's why I was surprised
when he disappeared.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.944
Disappeared?

07:23.977 --> 07:25.846
I left him waiting
for his coffee to go.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.515
When I brought it,
he was gone.

07:27.548 --> 07:31.051
He left a 20 on the table,
which is way too much.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.521
And poof.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.024
(dialing)

07:39.192 --> 07:40.894
(ringing)

07:40.928 --> 07:44.598
Ah.
McGee, you found him.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.500
Gibbs is okay.
Where was he?

07:46.534 --> 07:47.901
Abby, I need you
to ping his cell.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.537
So you didn't find him?

07:49.570 --> 07:51.505
Look, just do it, okay?
I'll explain later.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.007
Oh, I don't like
snooping on Gibbs.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.043
Abby, trust me,
you have to do this.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.583
This is against
my better judgment.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.617
What are you doing?

08:04.852 --> 08:06.086
ABBY: That's funny.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.287
What? What's funny?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.989
Not like funny "ha-ha."

08:09.022 --> 08:10.057
Like funny weird.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.493
Gibbs' phone is across
the street from the diner.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.768
Where you going?

08:20.801 --> 08:24.171
(dialing)

08:24.204 --> 08:26.640
McGee, are you gonna
tell me what's going on?

08:26.674 --> 08:27.641
Calling Gibbs' cell.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.677
(phone ringing)

08:48.629 --> 08:50.664
(phone ringing in mailbox)

09:02.242 --> 09:04.244
The post office sent
over an inspector.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.947
He opened up the mailbox,
and there they were.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.182
Yeah, telephone, wallet,
badge, and I.D.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.084
Was he robbed?
Hard to tell.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.054
No money in the wallet, but all
his credit cards are in there.

09:14.087 --> 09:17.858
Could Gibbs have dumped
his stuff in the mailbox?

09:17.891 --> 09:20.594
Maybe he was getting rid
of anything that could I.D. him.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.029
Undercover 101.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.363
You want to get rid
of anything on you

09:23.396 --> 09:24.865
that has your
real name on it.

09:24.898 --> 09:25.933
Exactly.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.234
Well, Agent Quinn
is gathering

09:27.267 --> 09:29.369
surveillance
and traffic videos

09:29.402 --> 09:31.905
of the area around Gibbs' truck
and the mailbox,

09:31.939 --> 09:34.241
so we'll see if they can
tell us something there.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.744
McGee, unlock his phone and find
the last calls in and out.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.648
Uh, Director,
Gibbs doesn't lock anything.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.950
And I can't believe he
still uses a flip phone.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.652
Besides, I already checked.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.054
The last two calls were
exchanges with Rebecca Chase.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.656
Who called who?

09:48.689 --> 09:50.057
She called him.
He called her back.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.058
Hmm.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.660
Who is Rebecca Chase?

09:52.693 --> 09:54.094
Gibbs' ex-wife number two.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.063
Actually, she may be
number three.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.365
I'm not... I get confused
on the order sometimes there.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.967
When were the calls?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.035
One was late last night,
the other early this morning.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.804
All right, let's not
dismiss anything.

10:03.837 --> 10:04.938
She might know something.
I'll give her a call.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.640
I'll take this stuff to Abby,

10:06.674 --> 10:08.041
see if maybe she can
pull a fingerprint

10:08.075 --> 10:10.844
or touch DNA from someone
that is not Gibbs.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.414
You know there are
over 4,200

10:14.447 --> 10:17.384
traffic surveillance
cameras in D.C.?

10:17.417 --> 10:19.953
More than any other city
in the U.S.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.157
Homeland is streaming me
video feed

10:24.191 --> 10:25.959
from the traffic camera

10:25.993 --> 10:28.962
closest to the diner.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.105
Bishop...

10:38.138 --> 10:40.841
why are you looking
at Kai Chen's file?

10:40.874 --> 10:42.342
I was deleting it.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.246
Please, for your
own sanity,

10:46.279 --> 10:48.181
leave tracking Chen
to the others.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.783
I will.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.351
Bishop, I've known
you since FLETC

10:51.384 --> 10:53.020
and I know how
persistent you are.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.089
Look, I understand

10:56.123 --> 10:57.991
you're in a bad
place right now.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.861
I'm better. We need
to focus on Gibbs.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.329
You get the surveillance videos?

11:02.362 --> 11:03.964
I'm just waiting.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.232
Homeland is streaming
them to me now.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.233
Mm-kay.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.868
Anything I can do?
Yes,

11:07.901 --> 11:09.102
you can get your
mind off revenge.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.804
Chen will get
his, okay?

11:10.838 --> 11:12.105
You need to stay out of it.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.808
You know he is a
very dangerous man.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.710
Don't worry, Alex, I hear you.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.111
Do you?
Mm-hmm.

11:20.247 --> 11:23.183
I'm gonna go see what
Abby's come up with on Gibbs.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.091
*

11:32.125 --> 11:33.126
Oh.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.064
Hug.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.833
(sighs)

11:39.867 --> 11:41.101
How are you?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.136
I wish everyone
would stop asking me that.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.105
I am okay.
Promise.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.473
I just want to
get back to work.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.075
I've just been--
I've been so worried

11:48.108 --> 11:50.143
about you and
now Gibbs.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.045
(sighs)
You find anything in his truck?

11:52.079 --> 11:53.246
No.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.116
And my mind
is spinning like a top,

11:56.149 --> 11:57.284
I'm conjuring up
all these

11:57.317 --> 11:59.219
horrible fates, you know.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.288
It's like he just vanished.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.356
It was-- like that, he was gone.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.491
(sighs)

12:04.524 --> 12:05.859
But then again, maybe

12:05.893 --> 12:07.194
he's just doing, like,
a Superman thing.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.896
You know, like, there was a, uh,

12:08.929 --> 12:11.765
like a damsel in distress,
but-- but I mean, who knows?

12:11.799 --> 12:13.000
This is what's
driving me crazy.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.367
We know nothing.
Abby...

12:16.169 --> 12:18.205
he's only been gone
a couple hours.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.407
And if anyone can take care
of himself, it's Gibbs.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.076
You're right.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.511
I mean, you're--

12:24.544 --> 12:25.979
you're definitely right.

12:27.214 --> 12:30.117
I need to center myself.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.920
I need to focus.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.355
Gibbs is
gonna be fine.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.025
Gibbs is gonna be super fine.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.359
Hey, any luck
with his things?

12:39.392 --> 12:41.494
Um,

12:41.528 --> 12:44.932
the only prints on them
are Gibbs'.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.234
I'm testing for DNA now.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.070
QUINN: Well, Gibbs rushed out
of the diner at 7:22.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.072
And then this camera
picks him up.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.576
McGEE: He's looking
right into the camera.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.045
He wanted us to see this.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.280
QUINN:
Very interesting.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.216
And here's the other camera
at the other end of the block.

13:03.250 --> 13:06.019
Is Gibbs limping or is it me?

13:06.053 --> 13:07.254
McGEE:
I think he is.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.089
McGee, do you recognize
this guy?

13:10.457 --> 13:11.091
No.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.227
Quinn, zoom in on the plate.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.065
I can't make it out.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.166
Yeah, it looks like

13:19.199 --> 13:22.135
five, something, "E."

13:22.169 --> 13:24.071
Yeah, I can't make it out,
either.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.105
I'll shoot the image
down to Abby,

13:25.138 --> 13:26.840
see if
she can enhance it.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.009
All right, I'll go see
what she can find.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.483
Hey-- oh, what
are you doing?

13:36.516 --> 13:39.086
The three Ps.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.154
Positive pyramid power.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.190
We have to get
Gibbs back.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.161
Uh, did you have a chance to,
uh, look at the license plate?

13:50.197 --> 13:52.399
That was fast.
Um, did you run it?

13:55.202 --> 13:57.270
Oh, okay. Um, well,

13:57.304 --> 13:59.907
I have all the faith
in the three Ps,

13:59.940 --> 14:02.175
uh, to bring Gibbs back.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.144
So, when he does
come back,

14:04.177 --> 14:05.946
I need a favor.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.180
(plate clinks)

14:07.214 --> 14:09.482
Oh, no.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.251
That's seven
years bad luck.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.286
Uh, no, I think
that's mirrors.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.189
Oh, my God.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.191
Quinn!

14:18.225 --> 14:20.427
It's the Kelly plate.
What happened?

14:20.460 --> 14:23.196
(sighs) It was an accident.
It was this morning.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.098
Gibbs is gonna be heartbroken.

14:25.132 --> 14:28.135
I know, but he-he won't be
if he never finds out.

14:28.168 --> 14:31.204
And I heard you are the master
at this, so can you fix it?

14:34.341 --> 14:35.608
I can do my best.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.044
Thanks.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.178
BISHOP:
Got a name

14:38.211 --> 14:40.280
and an address.
Bodie Whitman.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.349
Lives in Baltimore.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.984
VANCE:
Bodie Whitman.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.185
I remember that name.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.220
He spent ten years
in a federal prison

14:47.254 --> 14:48.655
for his part in
an armed robbery.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.024
Was one of Gibbs'
last undercover cases.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.325
It's before my time.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.663
It was... 2001.

14:56.696 --> 15:01.068
Whitman was a foot soldier in a
militant antigovernment militia

15:01.101 --> 15:03.236
led by his older brother.

15:03.270 --> 15:07.240
Gibbs infiltrated the group
using his backstopped alias,

15:07.274 --> 15:10.043
Leland Robert Spears.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.278
So, you and Torres are right.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.313
Gibbs dumped anything
that could identify him,

15:13.346 --> 15:15.048
went back undercover.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.516
What the hell
was Gibbs thinking?

15:16.549 --> 15:19.019
These guys are psychos.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.096
Ramsay Whitman.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.131
He's Bodie's older brother.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.233
He was behind the
hijacking of a Navy truck

15:33.266 --> 15:35.202
by an antigovernment
militia.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.736
Two Marine Guards were killed.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.439
The truck was transporting
spent nuclear fuel rods,

15:39.472 --> 15:41.174
radioactive isotopes.

15:41.208 --> 15:44.177
The intent was
to make a dirty bomb.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.013
So, Gibbs went undercover
as Spears.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.647
A month after the hijacking.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.249
How did he infiltrate
the group?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.218
VANCE: He was backstopped
as an ex-con,

15:51.251 --> 15:54.554
disgruntled former Marine
with antigovernment sentiments.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.489
He was embedded with
the group for months.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.225
We had very little contact
with him.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.526
Been there.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.128
VANCE: The object was
to find the fuel rods

16:01.161 --> 16:02.129
before they could use them.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.530
According to Gibbs,

16:03.563 --> 16:05.498
only Ramsay Whitman knew
where they were hidden.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.766
Were they ever recovered?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.436
No. They're still out there.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.204
What were they
planning to attack?

16:11.238 --> 16:12.339
D.C. Metro subway.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.241
QUINN: I remember
that op went south

16:14.274 --> 16:15.608
when I was in Philly.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.045
We never found out why,
but Ramsay got spooked.

16:18.078 --> 16:21.214
The gang scattered, and Gibbs
disappeared with the others.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.550
The only one that got arrested
was Ramsay's brother, Bodie,

16:23.583 --> 16:25.452
but he wasn't connected
to the hijacking.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.054
TORRES:
Did Gibbs blow his cover

16:27.087 --> 16:28.055
and testify at trial?

16:28.088 --> 16:29.289
No. Wasn't needed.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.292
Prison record says
Bodie got five years

16:32.325 --> 16:33.293
for harboring his brother.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.228
Badass that
he is, Bodie got

16:35.262 --> 16:37.230
some more time
for attacking a guard.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.199
So, what happened
to the rest of the militia?

16:39.232 --> 16:41.334
Three of them were killed
in a standoff

16:41.368 --> 16:42.735
with the FBI a year later.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.338
And Ramsay Whitman's
still on the wall.

16:45.372 --> 16:48.308
I want you to dig out every file
we have on the case.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.010
Locate every agent
that worked on it.

16:53.813 --> 16:57.317
BISHOP: Where the hell did
Gibbs go with the brother?

17:09.229 --> 17:12.099
I think ten bucks' worth
should get us to Baltimore.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.301
Here, here, here.
Why don't you fill 'er up.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.369
Wow. Look at you,
Mr. Leland Spears.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.672
I guess you're doing well.
Let me say this
about that, Bubba.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.641
You will be, too.
(chuckles)

17:21.674 --> 17:24.477
(woman speaking indistinctly)

17:24.511 --> 17:26.513
WOMAN: Okay, well,
I'm gonna have to wrap this up.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.715
Excuse me, ma'am?

17:28.748 --> 17:31.184
Ma'am, excuse me, I
wonder if you'd help me.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.285
Yes?

17:32.319 --> 17:33.720
I lost my phone, and, uh,

17:33.753 --> 17:35.722
need to make a short
call to my wife,

17:35.755 --> 17:37.590
just tell her I'll be late.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.527
Uh, I'm sorry, she's a
real worrier, you know?

17:41.561 --> 17:42.662
Don't be long.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.364
I've got to get going myself.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.198
Thank you so much.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.300
Vance caught up
with Gibbs' ex-wife.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.835
Yeah?
Yeah.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.204
It wasn't anything--
they were just making plans

17:51.238 --> 17:52.305
to go to dinner tonight.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.773
He was gonna have
dinner with Rebecca?

17:53.806 --> 17:55.442
(phone ringing)
Yeah.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.377
(ringing)

17:57.410 --> 17:59.212
Want to get that?
Yeah.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.819
Didn't answer.
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.789
At least I tried, huh?
That's all you can do.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.393
That was weird.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.862
Hmm?
Whoever it was just
hung up on me.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.230
I'm gonna call back.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.298
What was that all about?

18:18.331 --> 18:19.632
You know her?

18:19.666 --> 18:21.601
Some lady with phone trouble.

18:21.634 --> 18:22.869
(phone ringing)

18:22.902 --> 18:23.803
You okay?

18:23.836 --> 18:26.339
Yeah. I just got a headache.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.409
(phone ringing)

18:30.910 --> 18:31.844
Hello.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.346
Hi. Did you just call my number?

18:33.380 --> 18:34.447
No.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.448
A man just borrowed

18:35.482 --> 18:36.716
my phone to make a call.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.218
Could you describe him?

18:38.251 --> 18:39.319
Who is this?

18:39.352 --> 18:40.287
This is Special Agent McGee

18:40.320 --> 18:41.454
with NCIS, ma'am.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.855
This is crazy.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.324
What did the man look like?

18:44.357 --> 18:45.292
Well...

18:45.325 --> 18:46.793
he's 50-something,

18:46.826 --> 18:48.361
has silver hair

18:48.395 --> 18:49.562
and incredible blue eyes.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.631
Is he with a younger man
in an SUV?

18:51.664 --> 18:53.166
Yes.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.367
They're still here.
Did you want me

18:54.401 --> 18:55.868
No. No.
to give him the phone?

18:55.902 --> 18:57.604
Do not approach them.
Don't even look

18:57.637 --> 18:59.239
in their general
direction.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.541
Where are you?
At a gas station

19:01.574 --> 19:03.910
off I-95, just north
of Savage Park, Maryland.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.478
What do you want me to do?

19:05.512 --> 19:06.746
Nothing.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.181
Nothing. It's
best that you

19:08.215 --> 19:09.482
probably leave there.
Thank you.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.320
Gibbs is with Bodie
Whitman on the I-95,

19:13.353 --> 19:14.787
halfway between here
and Baltimore.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.489
According to Bodie's
driver's license,

19:16.523 --> 19:18.491
that's where he lives.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.461
MAN: It was the summer of '96,
and we were running surveillance

19:21.494 --> 19:25.398
on a chop shop-- just me and
a couple of hotshot young agents

19:25.432 --> 19:27.800
named Gibbs and Vance.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.502
That's Director Vance.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.504
And if I remember,
those two hotshots

19:31.538 --> 19:34.274
bailed your ass out of one hell
of a firefight that night.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.643
Is tha the story you've been
telling all these years, Leon?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.411
Come here!
Oh, it's good to see you.
(laughing)

19:38.445 --> 19:40.380
You, too, Fred.
Well,

19:40.413 --> 19:42.849
we both know you didn't pull me
off the back nine at National

19:42.882 --> 19:45.452
to reminisce, so...
why the hell am I here?

19:45.485 --> 19:46.853
An old case of yours
has resurfaced.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.389
Which one?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.626
My undercover I.D.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.495
Damn, I was hoping
it wasn't that one.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.363
You remember Deputy Director

19:56.396 --> 19:58.465
Doyle Roden
of the Department of Energy.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.599
Special Agent Pettis.

19:59.632 --> 20:00.600
Doyle.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.535
Uh, where's Gibbs?

20:02.569 --> 20:04.604
You mean Spears.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.239
Yeah.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.940
He crossed paths with
Bodie Whitman this morning.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.343
Made contact, then went dark.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.379
What do you think Gibbs'
intentions are, Director?

20:12.412 --> 20:14.314
I'm not sure, but my guess is

20:14.347 --> 20:16.783
he's trying to get a second
crack at Ramsay Whitman,

20:16.816 --> 20:19.352
who's been on our Most Wanted
Wall for the last 15 years.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.354
And that's not the only thing
that's gone missing.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.456
Finding those
nuclear fuel rods...

20:23.490 --> 20:25.558
still my responsibility.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.694
Want to get those back
before there's some sort

20:27.727 --> 20:29.362
of terrorist catastrophe.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.631
Well, th-this is great,
but I'm retired.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.367
12 years now.
I got three grandchildren.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.002
Two I even like.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.570
Why the hell would
I want to risk my ass

20:37.604 --> 20:39.639
diving back into
that Dumpster fire?

20:39.672 --> 20:41.508
VANCE:
I'm not asking you to, Fred.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.543
I want you two
to put your heads together,

20:43.576 --> 20:45.978
see if you remember anything
that's not in the files.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.447
Okay.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.649
Let's get started.

20:54.387 --> 20:55.655
TORRES:
Engine trouble, McGee?

20:55.688 --> 20:58.758
I'm pushing 70.

20:58.791 --> 21:02.895
Well, I'm just saying,
you know, given the situation,

21:02.929 --> 21:05.465
you know, you might want
to push a tiny bit harder.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.767
Look, I don't like the idea
of Gibbs running solo either,

21:07.800 --> 21:09.536
but... he'll manage.

21:09.569 --> 21:10.637
This isn't
his first rodeo.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.771
Have you ever ridden a bull,
McGee?

21:11.804 --> 21:13.506
No.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.842
Actually, that's not true, I did
ride a mechanical bull once

21:15.875 --> 21:18.611
at the Hoppy Gnome Bar.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.946
Really wasn't
my finest hour, though.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.615
What about you?
Have you ridden one?
Only one.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.352
Robert.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.686
The bull was named Robert?
Yeah.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.655
A big bastard, too.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.523
But we locked eyes.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.991
I couldn't back down.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.793
I mounted up,
and that, you know,

21:33.826 --> 21:36.028
that gate just exploded open.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.598
Oh, he was ferocious. He was
whipping me back and forth

21:38.631 --> 21:41.468
like I was a ragdoll,
and as the seconds ticked by,

21:41.501 --> 21:43.603
the crowd coming to life,

21:43.636 --> 21:45.772
(imitates chant):
"Torres, Torres.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.940
Torres...
(whispers): Torres."

21:47.974 --> 21:49.041
They kept chanting my name.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.110
Yeah. Yeah, I got that part.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.546
That day I...
I faced a monster, McGee,

21:53.580 --> 21:55.848
and I managed
to come out on top.

21:55.882 --> 21:58.918
Why would they name a bull
Robert?

21:58.951 --> 22:01.588
Doesn't matter. What does matter
is that I had to face

22:01.621 --> 22:03.790
that very same bull
two weeks later.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.893
And he was pissed off, man.

22:06.926 --> 22:10.029
And... this time
he knew my weakness.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.565
And he tossed me, like, 20 feet.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.734
How did you learn to bull-ride?

22:14.767 --> 22:16.536
I didn't.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.970
And that was part
of the problem.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.939
But my analogy still applies.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.774
What analogy?

22:21.808 --> 22:24.076
Working deep undercover

22:24.110 --> 22:26.746
is like riding the rodeo, McGee.

22:26.779 --> 22:27.814
You have to trust
your instincts.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.616
You got to hang on tight.

22:29.649 --> 22:32.118
I do know one, uh,
one rule for survival.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.821
Never battle
the same bull twice.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.088
Moral of the story is...

22:36.122 --> 22:37.424
Drive faster.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.491
Thank you.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.660
(engine humming)

22:50.036 --> 22:51.704
Tell you something, Bubba.

22:51.738 --> 22:52.972
You're gonna have
a hard time getting

22:53.005 --> 22:54.407
your security deposit back.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.675
(chuckles)
Yeah.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.678
Yeah. That is, uh...
least of my worries.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.747
Two months behind on the rent.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.151
Okay. Get this show on the road.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.519
Call Ramsay.

23:06.553 --> 23:07.587
Slow down, Spears.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.523
You know how
crazy he gets.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.892
Say the wrong thing,
and he flips.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.628
Unbelievable.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.564
What you're
telling me

23:17.597 --> 23:19.031
is you're still afraid of him.

23:23.102 --> 23:26.205
You know, we've only talked
a couple times over the years.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.940
I have no idea where he is.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.709
And that's the way he wants it.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.611
Absolutely. I get that.

23:31.644 --> 23:32.945
We can't mess with him.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.448
And I got
to make sure

23:35.482 --> 23:37.784
this buyer of yours is for real,
or he will get spooked.

23:38.818 --> 23:41.588
Let me say this about that.

23:41.621 --> 23:44.957
In the car, I thought
this was a done deal.

23:44.991 --> 23:46.659
And I am taking your word

23:46.693 --> 23:49.061
that Ramsay
still has the fuel rods.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.932
What is your problem?

23:52.965 --> 23:54.967
Get him on the phone
or I am gone!

23:55.001 --> 23:56.669
I don't just call him.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.004
What does that mean?

23:58.037 --> 23:59.739
Look, we've got
this way of contacting

23:59.772 --> 24:01.173
each other in an emergency.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.042
I call it the Bat-Signal,
and the only time

24:03.075 --> 24:04.944
I've used it since
he went underground

24:04.977 --> 24:07.714
was to tell him our father died.

24:07.747 --> 24:10.650
I'm waiting.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.522
(chuckles)

24:17.924 --> 24:19.759
I post our father's
antique watch

24:19.792 --> 24:22.729
on this online auction site.

24:22.762 --> 24:25.532
Ramsay's got the exact
watch on this wish list,

24:25.565 --> 24:26.966
and, you know, he'll get an
e-mail when it's posted,

24:26.999 --> 24:29.168
and hopefully
he responds.
How?

24:29.201 --> 24:32.038
Calls me back.
An untraceable burn phone.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.874
Bubba, come on.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.810
Come on. Post it.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.045
What the who?
(clears throat)

24:39.078 --> 24:41.047
You want this or not?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.249
Yeah.
All right.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.890
Got your phone?

24:50.923 --> 24:53.726
Yeah. Don't worry. If he
calls, we won't miss it.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.928
It's just around the corner.
We can eat there.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.865
Or if you want, we can
bring the food back.

25:04.671 --> 25:05.672
Hey!

25:05.705 --> 25:07.674
I'm sorry. My bad.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.643
You okay?

25:10.677 --> 25:13.245
Yeah. Thought maybe
that guy grabbed my wallet.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.882
Hey, nice picture, Spears.
(chuckles)

25:18.217 --> 25:21.854
Come on. Takeout's
across the street.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.164
Can't believe
you're back in D.C.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.166
Since last summer.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.769
I lived in Idaho
for a long time.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.105
BODIE: Yeah, well,
I rotted in jail for ten years.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.007
Made me hate the government
even more.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.075
GIBBS:
Absolutely, Bubba.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.845
Gonna give this country
a wake-up call.
Got that right.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.848
I tell you, it's been needing
one for a long time.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.183
I'm really impressed
with the way you slipped Gibbs

25:51.217 --> 25:52.719
that wallet and bug.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.787
The reverse-pickpocket.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.355
You like that?

25:56.388 --> 25:58.357
Little trick I learned
back in Ciudad del Este.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.593
Handy when you want
to plant evidence.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.829
Not that I ever done that.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.633
I'm getting hungry.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.735
What time is it?

26:13.806 --> 26:15.775
I practiced on you.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.710
Looks expensive.

26:17.744 --> 26:18.978
It is.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.013
(chuckles softly)

26:22.782 --> 26:24.951
Can't believe you still got
that Marine haircut.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.719
It reminds me,

26:26.753 --> 26:28.254
every morning
when I look in the mirror,

26:28.287 --> 26:30.957
just how much I hate how this
government controls my life.

26:30.990 --> 26:31.991
Sure doesn't sound like Gibbs.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.359
It's not.

26:33.392 --> 26:34.360
It's Spears.

26:34.393 --> 26:35.795
(phone ringing)

26:35.828 --> 26:37.363
BODIE:
No caller I.D.

26:37.396 --> 26:40.166
It's got to be him.
Let's hope he's in a good mood.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.300
Hey, big bro.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.302
Yeah, I'm okay.

26:43.335 --> 26:46.238
Got my good days. And you?

26:47.774 --> 26:49.408
Of course it's important.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.243
You'll never guess
who I ran into.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.712
Leland Spears.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.881
He's got
a proposition.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.383
He wants to talk to you.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.419
Hey, Bubba.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.288
What are the odds, huh?
Me running into your brother?

27:02.321 --> 27:07.393
Well, yeah. Yeah, you still got
the stuff, I got a buyer.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.361
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, real deep pockets.

27:09.395 --> 27:11.397
He'll make us all rich.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.366
I need an answer.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.303
Pronto.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.075
He said he will let us know.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.044
Well, sounds like we're gonna
be here for a little bit.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.078
(exhales)

27:36.155 --> 27:37.757
Hey.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.359
Hey.
How'd it go at the embassy?

27:40.392 --> 27:42.762
You learn anything
from MI6?
It was informative.

27:42.795 --> 27:46.032
Intel suggests Chen might be
on a yacht in the Aegean,

27:46.065 --> 27:47.299
off the coast
of Greece.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.968
They have a boat
under surveillance.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.403
It's hopeful.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.308
If Gibbs finds out
you're working on this

27:56.342 --> 27:57.844
and I'm helping you,

27:57.877 --> 27:59.712
he'll kill us both.

27:59.746 --> 28:02.448
I'm willing
to take that chance.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.152
Hey, Quinn.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.720
Hey.

28:07.754 --> 28:11.057
Mission accomplished.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.059
That's fantastic.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.994
How'd you get rid of the crack?

28:15.027 --> 28:16.863
The crack?

28:16.896 --> 28:17.696
What crack?

28:18.464 --> 28:19.732
Night.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.373
Bubba,

28:27.406 --> 28:30.476
red queen
on black king.

28:30.509 --> 28:33.245
Huh. Thanks.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.014
(phone ringing)

28:37.449 --> 28:39.251
Ramsay?

28:40.352 --> 28:42.388
Uh-huh.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.390
You sure?

28:44.423 --> 28:46.492
Yeah, yeah, he's still here.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.296
Okay. I will tell him.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.498
That was quick. Everything okay?

28:52.531 --> 28:54.533
BODIE:
Yeah. Yeah, Ramsay's, uh,

28:54.566 --> 28:56.135
gonna set up a meeting.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.771
Bitchin'.
Now you're talkin'. Where?

28:58.805 --> 29:02.274
Oh, he's gonna call back.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.476
Hey. Put the gun down.

29:04.510 --> 29:07.179
BODIE: You know,
what Ramsay really said

29:07.213 --> 29:10.349
is that Leland Spears
is a federal agent.

29:12.318 --> 29:13.752
(laughing)

29:16.956 --> 29:18.390
Oh, that's good.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.559
That's good. Where'd he come up
with that one?

29:20.592 --> 29:22.829
I don't know.
Well,

29:22.862 --> 29:24.396
he's insane. You know that.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.433
Paranoid. That's what
happened the last time.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.136
Bubba, don't-don't blow this.

29:30.169 --> 29:34.040
This is our chance to get
a message to the government.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.808
We will all get rich.

29:35.842 --> 29:39.111
You playing me, Spears? Or
whatever the hell your name is?

29:39.145 --> 29:41.848
He's messin' with you
just like he always did.
Shut up!

29:41.881 --> 29:43.983
I am not going back to prison,
man!

29:44.016 --> 29:45.985
Of course you're not.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.887
In any event,

29:47.920 --> 29:49.588
he is crazy.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.823
Okay.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.058
Okay, o-okay, okay, okay.

29:52.091 --> 29:55.061
S-Say-say that Ramsay...
is right.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.063
I mean, say that I am a fed.

29:57.096 --> 30:00.299
Uh-huh.
Then what? What?
You shoot me,

30:00.332 --> 30:01.433
and you get the gas chamber.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.335
That what you want,

30:03.369 --> 30:06.538
Bubba? So
far, Bodie,

30:06.572 --> 30:08.540
you haven't done anything wrong.

30:08.574 --> 30:11.878
All you've done...

30:11.911 --> 30:14.313
is talk to your brother.

30:14.346 --> 30:17.216
No crime
in that.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.551
Let's end it right here.
Put the weapon down.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.553
You know what makes quite
a statement, too?

30:21.587 --> 30:23.589
Shooting a federal agent.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.591
You're not gonna
get away with it.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.593
I'm not alone. There are
other agents outside the door.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.528
They're listening
to everything we've said.

30:29.561 --> 30:32.098
Don't take me for a fool.

30:32.131 --> 30:32.899
McGee!

30:32.932 --> 30:34.600
Right here,
boss.

30:34.633 --> 30:35.567
Torres!

30:35.601 --> 30:36.502
(clattering)

30:36.535 --> 30:38.137
Put the weapon down.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.176
(baby crying in distance)

31:08.600 --> 31:10.937
Gibbs.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.905
Thank God you're okay.

31:12.939 --> 31:15.407
Sure you're ready
to be back at work?

31:15.441 --> 31:17.977
It's where I need to be.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.146
How about you?
Well, I'm gonna feel
better when we catch

31:20.179 --> 31:21.948
Ramsay Whitman.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.482
Probably spooked him, he's
gonna disappear again.

31:23.515 --> 31:24.984
Where's Quinn?

31:25.017 --> 31:27.253
Uh, she just went down
to see Abby.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.521
Tell her I'm with Ducky.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.458
(door opens)

31:32.491 --> 31:34.393
He didn't have to die, Duck.

31:36.528 --> 31:39.398
You had no choice.

31:39.431 --> 31:40.933
Don't know if it'll help
your autopsy, but he was

31:40.967 --> 31:42.368
constantly popping those things.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.570
Tetrabenazine.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.338
Uh, it's prescribed for

31:46.372 --> 31:50.042
involuntary jerking
and writhing movements.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.577
Huh. I thought
he was strung out.

31:51.610 --> 31:55.581
No. No. I just requested
his prison medical records.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.183
They show he was diagnosed

31:57.216 --> 31:59.651
with Huntington's disease.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.453
Take a look.
It's progressive

32:01.487 --> 32:03.089
and debilitating.

32:03.122 --> 32:06.092
I can confirm it
with a brain scan.
(door opens)

32:06.125 --> 32:09.228
Hey, Duck.
Well, I have information

32:09.261 --> 32:11.363
on the last call
Bodie Whitman received.

32:11.397 --> 32:12.464
From his brother?

32:12.498 --> 32:14.100
Yeah. Uh, we traced it

32:14.133 --> 32:16.202
to a cell tower
in Tazewell County.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.603
You find anything on the phone
that made the call?

32:17.636 --> 32:19.538
Well, as suspected, it
was a cheap burner phone.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.107
It was purchased six years ago.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.408
There's no record of the buyer.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.744
We did try to ping it
and it was turned off.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.680
Ramsay destroyed that phone
as soon as he hung up.

32:28.714 --> 32:32.118
Excuse me-- Ramsay's
the brother?

32:32.151 --> 32:33.419
Well, I don't know
if this will help you,

32:33.452 --> 32:36.322
but Huntington's
is a rare disease.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.390
And if they were
full siblings,

32:38.424 --> 32:40.426
there's a 50-50
chance the brother

32:40.459 --> 32:42.594
could suffer from
the same disorder.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.596
Well, Tazewell County's
a small county--

32:44.630 --> 32:46.198
I mean, how many cases
of Huntington's disease

32:46.232 --> 32:47.566
can there be in the area?

32:47.599 --> 32:50.302
Not many. It's a
lead I can follow.

32:50.336 --> 32:51.403
QUINN:
I'll help you, Ducky.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.177
Leon, you wanted to see me?

32:58.210 --> 32:59.511
Mm-hmm.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.547
Why are you looking
at those two?

33:01.580 --> 33:03.715
I think I almost
got you killed.

33:05.051 --> 33:06.485
15 years ago,

33:06.518 --> 33:09.521
when you went undercover
to take down Ramsay Whitman,

33:09.555 --> 33:11.357
he somehow found out that
the federal government

33:11.390 --> 33:14.193
was closing in on him.
He disappeared.

33:14.226 --> 33:17.063
And yesterday, between
two phone calls to his brother,

33:17.096 --> 33:19.498
he learned that Leland Spears
was a federal agent.

33:19.531 --> 33:22.368
When we realized that you were
with Bodie Whitman, I called

33:22.401 --> 33:24.403
these two in to help,
and now

33:24.436 --> 33:25.504
we have a leak.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.373
A retired NCIS agent

33:27.406 --> 33:30.242
and the deputy director
of U.S. Department of Energy.

33:30.276 --> 33:31.477
Mm-hmm.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.346
(phone rings)

33:34.380 --> 33:35.714
Yes, Pamela.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.417
Send 'em in.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.785
(door opens)

33:39.818 --> 33:43.455
Jethro, there is someone
in Tazewell County

33:43.489 --> 33:46.658
who's being treated
for Huntington's disease.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.095
Alex.
Uh, may I

33:49.128 --> 33:50.329
use your computer,
Director?

33:50.362 --> 33:52.364
Certainly.
Tazewell County,

33:52.398 --> 33:53.765
Huntington's disease?

33:53.799 --> 33:56.135
Following a lead, Leon.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.639
That's the wrong name,
but his age is about right.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.508
He doesn't look
anything like the radical

34:02.541 --> 34:04.210
skinhead killer I remember.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.145
Get us a warrant, Leon.

34:06.178 --> 34:09.615
See if one of 'em got a call
from Tazewell County yesterday.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.285
Once upon a time, there lived

34:13.319 --> 34:16.655
a very, very nasty man.

34:16.688 --> 34:20.126
Ramsay Whitman was angry

34:20.159 --> 34:21.493
and disgruntled...

34:21.527 --> 34:23.495
Abbs.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.664
And he killed two Marines
and vanished into thin air.

34:25.697 --> 34:26.832
Or not.

34:31.670 --> 34:32.704
What do we know
about John Manning?

34:32.738 --> 34:34.673
Nothing, till 11 years ago,

34:34.706 --> 34:36.608
when he moved
to Northwest Virginia.

34:36.642 --> 34:38.577
Married a local woman
there, a schoolteacher.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.313
They have two kids together.
Girl's seven, boy's five.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.449
TORRES:
Yeah, residential real estate
broker, well liked

34:43.482 --> 34:44.783
in the community,
member of the Rotary Club,

34:44.816 --> 34:46.485
deacon in his church.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.720
He, uh, coaches
his daughter's soccer team.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.257
They went eight and two.
They're actually pretty good.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.325
You're sure that these two guys
are the same guy?

34:53.359 --> 34:54.626
Oh, yeah.

34:55.894 --> 34:59.398
Salient facial features
are a 96% match.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.799
Yeah, I know this guy.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.668
Ramsay Whitman's spooked.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.370
Come on, we got to move fast.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.608
Okay, we're just gonna
go to Grandma's, okay?

35:12.211 --> 35:13.712
(sighs)

35:15.447 --> 35:17.149
I have a dentist appointment
tomorrow.

35:17.183 --> 35:18.684
Don't worry, I'll call him.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.557
Wait. See if Ramsay's
leaving with the family.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.894
Rather not make the takedown
in front of the kids.
Roger that.

35:28.927 --> 35:31.663
QUINN:
You know, half of me is hoping
we're wrong about this guy.

35:31.697 --> 35:34.533
When you get to your mother's,
wait for my call.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.402
Okay, you're
really scaring me, John.

35:36.435 --> 35:37.736
Can't you tell me
what's going on?

35:37.769 --> 35:40.506
No. Not-not now.
Just... get going.

35:40.539 --> 35:41.840
Please.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.542
Okay.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.610
I love you.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.712
I love you, too.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.617
(engine starts)

36:00.692 --> 36:02.394
All right, Torres,
you're with me.

36:02.428 --> 36:03.762
McGee and Quinn, take the back.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.597
Let's go.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.727
Hey, go inside and be quiet.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.978
(knocking)
GIBBS: NCIS!

36:58.584 --> 36:59.985
RAMSAY:
I'm unarmed.

37:00.018 --> 37:02.220
I'm going to
unlock the door.

37:09.795 --> 37:10.796
Step out.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.269
Leland Spears.

37:17.303 --> 37:20.038
Never thought
I'd see you again,

37:20.071 --> 37:21.707
Bubba.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.275
Gibbs.

37:23.309 --> 37:26.011
It's NCIS Special Agent Gibbs.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.823
How'd he explain the tats
to his wife?

37:37.856 --> 37:40.326
He said that she knew
that he had a past,

37:40.359 --> 37:42.928
riding with bikers.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.431
The warrant
paid off.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.732
Deputy Director Roden got a call

37:46.765 --> 37:48.934
from Ramsay's burn phone
yesterday.

37:48.967 --> 37:52.638
Text Gibbs.
RAMSAY: I'm willing to tell you
anything you want to know.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.506
But I need you
to promise me something.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.808
No deals.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.911
You killed two Marines.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.649
(phone dings)

38:03.682 --> 38:05.784
I'm just thinking about

38:05.817 --> 38:08.654
my wife and kids.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.722
They don't know anything

38:10.756 --> 38:12.524
about what happened.

38:12.558 --> 38:14.393
Or who I was.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.530
I don't want them
brought into this.

38:18.564 --> 38:20.366
They won't be...

38:20.399 --> 38:21.967
if you cooperate.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.769
What do you want to know?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.937
Where are the nuclear fuel rods?

38:25.971 --> 38:28.574
Buried.

38:28.607 --> 38:32.077
About 500 feet from where
we hijacked the truck.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.948
I carefully
selected the spot

38:36.982 --> 38:39.385
because it's near
an auto salvage yard.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.119
We unloaded
the barrels

38:41.152 --> 38:42.754
and the truck drove away.

38:42.788 --> 38:45.056
We tracked that truck
halfway across the state.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.091
Figured you would.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.832
Okay, write it all down.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.767
And include how
Deputy Director Roden

38:55.801 --> 38:57.836
at the Department
of Energy

38:57.869 --> 38:59.671
tipped you off...

38:59.705 --> 39:00.772
both times.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.073
(short chuckle)

39:02.107 --> 39:03.575
You know.

39:03.609 --> 39:04.810
Yeah.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.111
Write it.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.453
When I'm finished...

39:16.121 --> 39:18.123
can I see my brother's body?

39:21.827 --> 39:23.429
REPORTER:
It's been almost 15 years

39:23.462 --> 39:24.963
since the nuclear fuel rods
were stolen.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.097
(door opens)
QUINN: Gibbs?

39:26.131 --> 39:27.533
Yeah.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.834
Well, came by to tell you that

39:28.867 --> 39:31.503
the FBI picked up
Deputy Director Roden.

39:31.537 --> 39:34.440
Is he talking?
Yeah, apparently he's
always been antigovernment.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.509
He took the job at the DoE
just to get on the inside.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.978
And the FBI is now looking
at all of his other cases

39:40.011 --> 39:42.414
to see how much
damage he's done.

39:44.149 --> 39:46.952
Quinn, you could've
called me or...

39:46.985 --> 39:48.854
told me about that
in the morning.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.990
Yeah, uh...

39:52.023 --> 39:53.692
there's something else.

39:53.725 --> 39:57.028
I feel so guilty
about this.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.005
I was wondering
what happened to that.

40:07.038 --> 40:08.674
Well, it was
when you were missing.

40:08.707 --> 40:11.009
Bishop and I came here
to look for you, and I...

40:11.042 --> 40:12.544
I don't know what happened.
I...

40:12.578 --> 40:15.947
It was an accident--
I just broke the dish in half.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.716
Yeah.

40:17.749 --> 40:20.652
But it's fixed.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.821
You could've just
snuck it back in here.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.756
That's not my style.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.124
Don't beat yourself up
over that.

40:26.157 --> 40:29.194
I do, I do.
I beat myself up over it,

40:29.227 --> 40:31.196
because I-I know how...

40:31.229 --> 40:33.999
horrible it is
to lose something special.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.201
I...

40:36.234 --> 40:38.470
When I was 16, my mother
gave me this bracelet,

40:38.504 --> 40:41.640
and it was from
my grandmother, and...

40:41.673 --> 40:43.909
I lost it.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.878
It's... I haven't
been able to tell her.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.248
Yeah, well, Kelly made this

40:50.281 --> 40:52.851
for her mom and me
when she was in third grade.

40:52.884 --> 40:55.854
I guess I used
it too much--

40:55.887 --> 40:57.889
it got a crack.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.592
It was hairline
at first, but...

41:00.626 --> 41:02.928
turned into something bigger.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.631
But look at it now-- it's like
new. How'd you do this?

41:05.664 --> 41:06.998
You believe in miracles?

41:07.032 --> 41:08.900
No.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.235
You believe in Abby?

41:10.268 --> 41:11.903
With all my heart.

41:11.937 --> 41:13.939
All right.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.108
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.511
Quinn, tell your mom
about the bracelet.

41:19.545 --> 41:21.513
Yeah, no.

41:21.547 --> 41:23.081
Long story.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.950
I got time.
