WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.461
ROSSI: PREVIOUSLY
ON "CRIMINAL MINDS"...

00:02.500 --> 00:03.694
YOU'RE NOT
GOING DOWN?

00:03.730 --> 00:05.288
I HAVE TO GO UP,
ACTUALLY.

00:05.330 --> 00:07.332
OH, RIGHT, YOU'RE
MEETING WITH BARNES.

00:07.370 --> 00:09.065
SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

00:09.110 --> 00:10.509
NOT AS LONG AS
I'M IN CHARGE.

00:10.540 --> 00:12.804
GOOD EVENING, AGENT JAREAU.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.501
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
BARN ES.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.144
I'M SORRY FOR
THE SUDDEN URGENCY

00:16.180 --> 00:17.477
IN HAVING TO MEET
TONIGHT.

00:17.510 --> 00:18.647
HOWEVER, EFFECTIVE
IMMEDIATELY,

00:18.680 --> 00:21.740
SSA EMILY PRENTISS
WILL BE PLACED ON
ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE

00:21.780 --> 00:23.714
PENDING AN INTERNAL REVIEW.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.513
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
LEAVING YOUR
CELL PHONE OUT HERE,

00:25.550 --> 00:27.211
WE CAN TALK IN MY OFFICE.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.094
MY APOLOGIES FOR
THE CLOAK-AND-DAGGER
ROUTINE WITH THE EMAIL.

00:36.130 --> 00:37.392
I NEEDED A REASON
TO BRING YOU IN

00:37.430 --> 00:39.489
THAT WOULD ENSURE
A CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.292
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
AGENT PRENTISS

00:41.340 --> 00:43.467
HAS BEEN PLACED ON
ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE?

00:45.410 --> 00:46.809
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
OVER YOUR WORK,

00:46.840 --> 00:49.604
AND I THINK YOU'RE
DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.141
WHY DO YOU THINK
THE BRASS DIDN'T
GIVE YOU A SHOT

00:52.180 --> 00:54.478
AT UNIT CHIEF
WHEN AGENT HOTCHNER
ELECTED TO LEAVE?

00:54.520 --> 00:56.647
PRENTISS WAS
THE NATURAL CHOICE.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.282
SHE HAD SENIORITY.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.123
YOU'RE AWARE THIS MONTH
MARKS THE ONE-YEAR
ANNIVERSARY

01:03.160 --> 01:05.481
OF AGENT REID'S
ARREST IN MEXICO?

01:05.530 --> 01:08.499
I WAS AWARE THAT WAS
COMING UP, YES.

01:08.530 --> 01:09.724
WHEN SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPENS,

01:09.770 --> 01:11.397
IT'S STANDARD
OPERATING PROCEDURE

01:11.430 --> 01:13.660
FOR THE DIRECTOR
TO INITIATE
AN INTERNAL AUDIT.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.258
I'VE BEEN ASKED TO GO
OVER THE BAU's CASELOAD

01:15.300 --> 01:16.858
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE
FOLLOWING PROTOCOL.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.299
WE WORK BY THE BOOK,
ALWAYS.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.877
THEN THIS SHOULD BE
A FAIRLY PAINLESS PROCESS.

01:21.910 --> 01:22.740
OF COURSE.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.839
AS TEAM LEADER,
AGENT PRENTISS WILL NEED

01:24.880 --> 01:26.814
TO GIVE A FULL ACCOUNT
OF THE BAU's ACTIONS.

01:26.850 --> 01:28.442
THAT'S WHY EFFECTIVE
IMMEDIATELY,

01:28.480 --> 01:31.210
YOU WILL BE THE ACTING
HEAD OF THE BEHAVIORAL
ANALYSIS UNIT.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.150
1--

01:33.190 --> 01:34.111
PENDING FURTHER REVIEW,
YOU AND YOUR TEAM

01:34.160 --> 01:35.513
WILL REMAIN
ON ACTIVE DUTY.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.324
AGENT JAREAU,
AS A COURTESY,

01:38.360 --> 01:40.521
I CHOSE
TO INFORM YOU FIRST.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.460
I'LL BE SPEAKING
WITH AGENT PRENTISS
IN THE MORNING,

01:42.500 --> 01:44.422
SO I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D KEEP THIS
BETWEEN US

01:44.470 --> 01:46.199
UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM ME.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.232
EMILY?

01:54.280 --> 01:57.204
PRENTISS: HEY, I WAS HOPING
WE WERE GONNA GET THE NIGHT OFF,

01:57.250 --> 01:59.218
BUT WE'VE JUST
PULLED ANOTHER CASE.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.672
I KNOW IT'S BEEN
A LONG WEEK, BUT I NEED
YOU BACK HERE.

02:00.720 --> 02:01.869
ARE YOU STILL IN--

02:01.920 --> 02:04.582
EMILY, SOMETHING'S
GOING ON.

02:06.820 --> 02:10.256
PRENTISS: THANK YOU ALL FOR
GETTING BACK HERE SO QUICKLY.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.484
I GOT A CALL FROM
CHIEF WHEELER

02:11.530 --> 02:13.259
AT THE NEW ORLEANS
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.927
THEY'VE REQUESTED OUR HELP.
GARCIA, GO AHEAD.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.589
GARCIA: THE BIG EASY
HAS ITS OWN BIG BAD
OPERATING IN ITS MIDST.

02:18.630 --> 02:22.168
EARLIER TODAY, POLICE
UNCOVERED A MASS GRAVE

02:22.210 --> 02:24.166
INSIDE
A VAN DALIZED CRYPT.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.734
PRENTISS: TREM CEMETERY.

02:25.770 --> 02:28.170
10 BODIES IN TOTAL
WERE DISCOVERED

02:28.210 --> 02:29.746
BY THE GROUNDSKEEPER
THIS AFTERNOON.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.668
GARCIA: YEAH. THE BODIES
WERE BURIED AND BURNED

02:31.710 --> 02:34.247
INSIDE THE SECLUDED TOMB
THAT HAD BEEN PRIED OPEN.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.487
THEY ARE BELIEVED TO
HAVE BEEN PLACED THERE
IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.909
THE TOMB WAS OFF-LIMITS
DUE TO SOME MAINTENANCE
BEING DONE.

02:38.950 --> 02:42.386
ROSSI: LOOKS LIKE
LOCAL PD IS STILL WORKING
ON I.D.ing THE VICTIMS.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.227
HAS A CAUSE OF DEATH
BEEN DETERMINED?

02:44.260 --> 02:46.694
NO. BUT THE CORONER
DID REVEAL THIS ONE
SUPER ICKY DETAIL--

02:46.730 --> 02:48.721
ALL OF THE BODIES HAD BEEN
DRAINED OF THEIR BLOOD.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.967
LET'S MAKE SURE
TO CHECK ON THAT
FIRST THING.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.865
TREM CEMETERY'S
AN ACTIVE SITE.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.891
IT'S FAMOUS.
IT'S THE OLDEST
CEMETERY IN THE CITY.

02:54.940 --> 02:56.532
REID: HOME TO MARIE LAVEAU,

02:56.570 --> 02:57.832
THE VOODOO QUEEN
OF NEW ORLEANS,

02:57.870 --> 03:00.805
KNOWN FOR HER POWERS
OF CLAIRVOYANCE, HEALING,
AND INTIMIDATION.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.603
LEGEND HAS IT SHE ONCE
HELPED FREE A MAN

03:02.650 --> 03:05.448
ACCUSED OF MURDER BY PRAYING
FOR 72 HOURS STRAIGHT

03:05.480 --> 03:06.913
WITH 3 HOT PEPPERS
IN HER MOUTH.

03:06.950 --> 03:09.942
VOODOO QUEEN.
I MEAN, IS THAT
WHAT THIS IS?

03:09.990 --> 03:11.844
SOME KIND OF
RITUALISTIC KILLING?

03:11.890 --> 03:13.255
SIMMONS:
I SEE THESE XS HERE.

03:13.290 --> 03:14.382
THEY'RE USED TO DENOTE
THE GRAVE

03:14.420 --> 03:15.853
OF A POWERFUL
VOODOO PRACTITIONER.

03:15.890 --> 03:18.279
MARKINGS LIKE THIS AREN'T
UNCOMMON IN THESE PARTS.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.696
THESE LOOK LIKE THEY'VE
BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE.

03:20.730 --> 03:23.221
COULD BE THE REASON
OUR UNSUB CHOSE
THIS PARTICULAR CRYPT

03:23.270 --> 03:24.623
TO DO HIS BIDDING.

03:24.670 --> 03:27.639
NEW ORLEANS PD WANTS
US THERE ASAP.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.934
THERE IS ONE MORE THING.
I WON'T BE COMING ALONG.

03:29.970 --> 03:32.473
JJ WILL BE ACTING AS
UNIT CHIEF IN MY ABSENCE.

03:32.510 --> 03:35.832
I HAVE A MEETING WITH
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR BARNES
TOMORROW MORNING.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.303
IT'S SHORT NOTICE, BUT
AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND,

03:38.350 --> 03:40.238
IT'S JUST A STANDARD
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW,

03:40.280 --> 03:42.817
SO I'M SURE EVERYTHING
WILL BE FINE.

03:46.520 --> 03:50.456
OK. UM, WHEELS UP IN 30.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.803
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.649
PRENTISS:
"MY WOUND IS GEOGRAPHY.

04:52.690 --> 04:55.557
IT IS ALSO MY ANCHORAGE,
MY PORT OF CALL."

04:55.590 --> 04:58.081
PAT CON ROY.

04:58.130 --> 05:00.519
FIRST BARNES PULLS YOU
IN FOR A LATE-NIGHT MEETING,

05:00.560 --> 05:01.959
THEN PRENTISS.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.525
AND IT FEELS LIKE
SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

05:04.570 --> 05:05.821
YEAH, AND WHY ALL
THE URGENCY?

05:05.870 --> 05:07.667
I MEAN, IT COULDN'T HAVE
WAITED TILL WE ALL GOT BACK?

05:07.700 --> 05:10.567
SOMETHING
MUST HAVE TRIGGERED
AN INTERNAL REVIEW.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.578
IT'S ME.

05:12.610 --> 05:14.430
IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR
SINCE MY ARREST IN MEXICO.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.936
IT'S JUST
AN ANNUAL REVIEW,

05:15.980 --> 05:17.709
STANDARD OPERATING
PROCEDURE.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.674
MA'IT, YOU WORKED
WITH BARNES ON YOUR
LAST ASSIGNMENT.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.540
HOW MUCH TROUBLE
ARE WE IN?

05:22.590 --> 05:23.943
I MEAN, I HATE TO SAY IT,

05:23.990 --> 05:25.548
BUT THIS IS
THE EXACT SAME THING

05:25.590 --> 05:28.616
SHE DID WITH THE I.R.T.
BEFORE DISBANDING THE UNIT.

05:28.660 --> 05:29.922
SHE STARTED WITH
THE HEAD OF THE TEAM,

05:29.960 --> 05:31.621
THEN SHE WORKED
HER WAY DOWN.

05:31.660 --> 05:32.957
SHE TRIED TO PIT US
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.922
BARNES' REPUTATION
PRECEDES HER.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.666
SHE'S CLIMBED
THE RANKS WELL.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.759
WELL, CLEARLY SHE'S
GOOD AT HER JOB.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.028
WE'RE BE'ITER.

05:40.070 --> 05:42.061
JJ: AND WE HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.658
WE CAN'T WORRY ABOUT
THIS RIGHT NOW

05:43.710 --> 05:44.859
BECAUSE WE HAVE A CASE.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.605
PEOPLE NEED OUR HELP.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.699
SO, LET'S GET STARTED
WITH VICTIMOLOGY.

05:48.740 --> 05:51.106
WHEELER:
5 OF THE 10 VICTIMS
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.914
THESE 3--JASON CHAMERS,
LINDSAY MONTOYA,

05:53.950 --> 05:55.918
AND GARY KEULCHY--
WERE HOMELESS.

05:55.950 --> 05:58.839
AND THESE TWO--
SONEQUA FOX
AND DANIEL RIKERS--

05:58.890 --> 06:00.755
WERE WORKING
PROFESSIONALS.

06:00.790 --> 06:02.929
AND MR. RIKERS
AND MS. FOX WERE

06:02.960 --> 06:04.825
BOTH REPORTED MISSING
A WEEK AND A HALF AGO.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.589
THAT'S CORRECT.
THEY BOTH LEFI' THEIR
HOMES IN MID-CITY

06:06.630 --> 06:08.154
AND NEVER RETURNED.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.599
AND THE 3 HOMELESS
VICTIMS WERE LAST SEEN

06:09.630 --> 06:11.461
IN A SHELTER NEAR
THE FRENCH QUARTER?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.092
YES. WE PERIODICALLY
CHECK THE NIGHTLY
ROLL CALLS

06:13.140 --> 06:14.596
WHEN WE FIND A BODY.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.164
THEY WERE MOST LIKELY
PANHANDLING IN THE AREA.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.431
ROSSI: OUR UNSUB CROSSED
RACIAL AND GENDER LINES.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.538
AND HE'S MOBILE.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.468
REID: YOU KNOW, REALISTICALLY,
IT'S LIKELY EACH VICTIM

06:22.510 --> 06:24.705
WAS ABDUCT ED, KILLED,
AND DISPOSED OF INDIVIDUALLY.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.479
JJ: WE NEED TO SEE WHAT
THE M.E. CAN TELL US

06:26.520 --> 06:27.771
ABOUT THE TIMELINE
OF THE MURDERS.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.048
LEWIS: WE'D EXPECT
AN UNSUB LIKE THIS

06:29.080 --> 06:30.786
TO START WITH HIGH-RISK
VICTIMS LIKE THE HOMELESS

06:30.820 --> 06:32.515
AND THEN MOVE ON
TO LOW-RISK VICTIMS

06:32.560 --> 06:33.686
LIKE SONEQUA AND DANIEL,

06:33.720 --> 06:35.483
BUT UNTIL WE I.D.
THE REMAINING VICTIMS,

06:35.520 --> 06:36.885
IT'S REALLY HARD TO
DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.989
SO HE'D NEED SOMEWHERE
TO HOLD THEM

06:39.030 --> 06:40.520
AND DO HIS BLOODLETTING
BUSINESS

06:40.560 --> 06:41.754
BEFORE BRINGING THEM
BACK TO THE CRYPT.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.722
I'VE ALREADY STARTED
A GEO-PROFILE, BUT
THE MORE WE CAN LEARN

06:43.770 --> 06:45.726
ABOUT THE VICTIMS'
LAST MOMENTS, THE MORE
ACCURATE IT'LL BE.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.658
JJ: GOOD. GARCIA CAN HELP
WITH THAT, TOO.

06:47.700 --> 06:48.997
WOMAN: EXCUSE ME, SIR.

06:52.810 --> 06:54.630
FOUND ANOTHER
BURN ED BODY.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.774
THIS TIME IN A CRYPT
IN TREM CEMETERY
NUMBER TWO.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.107
JUST ONE?
YEAH.

06:59.150 --> 07:02.039
AND THE CRYPT WASN'T
NEARLY AS SECLUDED.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.638
WE'VE DISRUPTED
HIS ROUTINE.

07:03.690 --> 07:04.884
ANOTHER TOMB,

07:04.920 --> 07:06.512
BUT NOW HE'S
IMPROVISING.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.592
DAVE, HEAD TO THE M.E.

07:12.630 --> 07:14.552
SPENCE, TARA, WHY DON'T
YOU GUYS STICK AROUND HERE,

07:14.600 --> 07:16.727
HELP WITH
THE IDENTIFICATION EFFORTS?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.590
MA'I'I' AND LUKE,
YOU'RE WITH ME.

07:18.630 --> 07:20.996
LET'S HEAD TO THIS
LATEST CRIME SCENE.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.736
BARNES: I WANT TO REITERATE
THAT THIS CONVERSATION
IS ON THE RECORD.

07:23.770 --> 07:26.159
TODAY IS
FEBRUARY 1, 2018.

07:26.210 --> 07:27.802
THIS IS ASSISTANT
DIRECTOR LINDA BARNES

07:27.840 --> 07:30.001
SITTING WITH UNIT CHIEF
EMILY PRENTISS.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.769
NOW, AGENT PRENTISS,
DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE
HERE TODAY?

07:32.820 --> 07:34.048
I DO NOT.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.116
AGENT JAREAU
DIDN'T CALL YOU?

07:36.150 --> 07:37.686
NO.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.722
WE'RE NOT OFF TO
A VERY GOOD START,
ARE WE?

07:42.760 --> 07:46.184
I'VE ASKED YOU
ONE QUESTION, AND
YOU'VE LIED TO ME.

07:46.230 --> 07:49.859
SHALL WE TRY THAT
AGAIN? DID AGENT
JAREAU CALL YOU?

07:49.900 --> 07:52.027
NO, AGENT JAREAU
DID NOT CALL ME.

07:52.070 --> 07:54.538
I CALLED HER TO LET HER
KNOW WE HAD ANOTHER CASE.

07:54.570 --> 07:56.800
SHE INFORMED ME THAT
SHE HAD SPOKEN WITH YOU,

07:56.840 --> 07:59.001
BUT SHE DID NOT
DISCLOSE WHAT WAS SAID.

08:00.940 --> 08:03.272
AGENT JAREAU
ISN'T IN ANY TROUBLE.

08:03.310 --> 08:06.143
I EXPECTED
SHE'D CALL YOU.

08:06.180 --> 08:08.648
AS I'M SURE
YOU'RE AWARE, IT IS
THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY

08:08.680 --> 08:10.216
OF AGENT REID'S
ARREST IN MEXICO

08:10.250 --> 08:12.616
FOLLOWING A HIGH-SPEED
CHASE WITH THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.857
YOUR TEAM TRAVELED DOWN
TO CONDUCT YOUR OWN
INVESTIGATION

08:15.890 --> 08:17.050
INTO THE INCIDENT

08:17.090 --> 08:18.751
AND, PER
YOUR CASE REPORT,

08:18.790 --> 08:21.588
TRANSFER HIM TO
A FEDERAL FACILITY
IN THE US.

08:21.630 --> 08:22.995
I WENT THROUGH
YOUR FINDINGS

08:23.030 --> 08:25.897
AND SUBSEQUENT
MONTHS-LONG INVESTIGATION.

08:25.930 --> 08:29.900
THE THING IS, ONCE
I STARTED TO DIG,
I COULDN'T STOP.

08:29.940 --> 08:32.204
WHAT I FOUND,
AGENT PRENTISS,

08:32.240 --> 08:33.776
WAS THAT WITH YOU
AT THE HELM,

08:33.810 --> 08:37.007
TEAM LOYALTY
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN BUREAU POLICY.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.109
THAT'S NOT
A FAIR ASSESSMENT.

08:39.150 --> 08:41.072
AS YOUR TEAM HAS EXPANDED,
SO HAVE THE CASES

08:41.120 --> 08:42.883
YOU'VE AGREED
TO INVESTIGATE.

08:42.920 --> 08:44.080
MISTAKES HAVE BEEN MADE.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.940
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
HERE TO DISCUSS--

08:45.990 --> 08:48.117
THE STATE OF
THE BEHAVIORAL
ANALYSIS UNIT

08:48.160 --> 08:50.788
UNDER THE LEADERSHIP
OF EMILY PRENTISS.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.759
[INDISTINCT
POLICE RADIO CHATTER]

09:02.810 --> 09:04.835
SIMMONS: UNSUB WAS CONFIDENT
HE WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT.

09:04.870 --> 09:07.100
THIS WOULD TAKE
A LOT OF EFFORT.

09:07.140 --> 09:08.300
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

09:08.340 --> 09:10.649
ALVEZ: SCORCHING PATTERNS
ON THE CONCRETE

09:10.680 --> 09:12.978
INDICATE THE UNSUB USED
SOME KIND OF ACCELERANT.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.578
NO SIGNS OF BLOOD
OR TRAUMA.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.814
IT'S LIKELY HE
WAS KILLED ELSEWHERE

09:15.850 --> 09:17.283
AND THEN DISPOSED
HERE.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.117
ALL RIGHT. WELL, OUR VICTIM
HERE IS JEREMY PAULSON.

09:19.150 --> 09:21.789
ACCORDING TO HIS WIFE, HE
LEFT WORK EARLY LAST NIGHT

09:21.820 --> 09:23.856
TOLD CO-WORKERS
HE WASN'T FEELING WELL.

09:23.890 --> 09:26.893
HIS CAR WAS FOUND PARKED
AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD
BASKETBALL COURT.

09:26.930 --> 09:29.899
HIS WATER BOTTLE
AND BASKETBALL
WERE FOUND NEARBY.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.898
SO DID HE MEET
SOMEONE

09:31.930 --> 09:33.067
OR WAS HE JUST
PLAYING HOOKY?

09:33.100 --> 09:35.864
WE SHOULD GET LOCAL PD
TO CANVASS THE AREA
FOR WITNESSES,

09:35.900 --> 09:38.300
BOTH HERE AND AT THE PARK.

09:38.340 --> 09:42.743
THIS CRYPT DOESN'T HAVE ANY
VOODOO MARKINGS OR SYMBOLS,

09:42.780 --> 09:44.645
WHICH IS ODD,

09:44.680 --> 09:48.047
CONSIDERING THAT A LOT OF
THE GRAVES IN THIS AREA DO.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.980
SO MAYBE IT'S NOT
AS IMPORTANT TO HIM

09:50.020 --> 09:51.681
AS WE INITIALLY THOUGHT.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.984
ALVEZ: WELL, IF THIS
DOESN'T INVOLVE VOODOO,

09:54.020 --> 09:56.159
THEN WHY THE ELABORATE M.O.?

09:56.190 --> 09:59.956
IT'S NOT FOR SHOW.
HE'S CONCEALING
AND BURNING THE BODIES.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.820
JJ: AND WE FOUND
HIS BURIAL GROUND

10:01.860 --> 10:03.396
AND HE BARELY SKIPPED A BEAT.

10:03.430 --> 10:05.990
THIS FEELS LESS LIKE
SOME KIND OF A RITUAL

10:06.030 --> 10:07.895
AND MORE LIKE A MISSION.

10:07.940 --> 10:11.159
THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT'S HIS GRIEVANCE?

10:21.750 --> 10:25.186
SORRY. JUST ALLERGIES.

10:53.980 --> 10:55.709
WHAT YOU DOIN'?

10:55.750 --> 10:57.081
YOU CAN'T PARK
HERE. IT'S--

10:57.120 --> 10:59.714
WHAT?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.250
UNH!

11:04.960 --> 11:08.396
SO DESPITE HAVING
ONE OF THE HIGHEST SOLVE
RATES IN THE BUREAU,

11:08.430 --> 11:12.389
YOUR LEADERSHIP RECORD
IS COMPLICATED.

11:12.430 --> 11:13.897
THIS BUSINESS WITH ROSWELL

11:13.940 --> 11:15.931
JUST BEING
THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE.

11:15.970 --> 11:18.438
MOST RECENT EXAMPLE
OF WHAT?

11:20.040 --> 11:21.439
A TEAM GONE ROGUE.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.906
WE'VE BEEN ACCUSED
OF THAT BEFORE,

11:24.950 --> 11:26.474
AND WE'VE EVEN TESTIFIED

11:26.510 --> 11:28.216
IN FRONT OF THE SENATE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.411
IT WASN'T TRUE THEN,
AND IT ISN'T TRUE NOW.

11:30.450 --> 11:32.418
BUT YOU'D AGREE
THAT TRANSPARENCY
AND ACCOUNTABILITY

11:32.450 --> 11:34.156
ARE OF THE UTMOST
IMPORTANCE?

11:34.190 --> 11:35.782
OF COURSE.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.789
SO THE SHOOTING DEATH
OF A MAN IN CUSTODY

11:38.830 --> 11:40.422
IN A POLICE STATION
IN ROSWELL--

11:40.460 --> 11:42.928
HOLD ON. LET'S JUST GET
OUR FACTS STRAIGHT FIRST.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.859
IT WAS A SUICIDE,
NOT A SHOOTING.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.095
THE MAN IN QUESTION
WASN'T IN CUSTODY,

11:48.140 --> 11:50.461
AND HE WAS NOT
IN A POLICE STATION.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.809
MR. DOWNEY VOLUNTARILY
AGREED TO SPEAK
WITH THE POLICE

11:53.840 --> 11:57.071
ABOUT AN UNUSUAL DEATH
IN THE ROSWELL TRUTHER
COMMUNITY.

11:57.110 --> 11:59.408
AND HE HAD
A CONCEALED WEAPON?

11:59.450 --> 12:03.216
THE WEAPON WASN'T DETECTED
DUE TO A MECHANICAL ERROR

12:03.250 --> 12:06.788
WITH THE METAL DETECTOR
THAT THE ROSWELL PD
HAD INSTALLED.

12:06.820 --> 12:10.859
THERE WAS NO INDICATION
THAT HE OR ANYONE ELSE
WOULD BE ARMED.

12:10.890 --> 12:13.051
HOWEVER, IF YOU HAD
QUESTIONED THIS GROUP

12:13.100 --> 12:14.328
FORMALLY
IN A POLICE STATION,

12:14.360 --> 12:16.294
THE OUTCOME MIGHT
VERY WELL HAVE BEEN
DIFFERENT.

12:16.330 --> 12:18.093
THE TRUTHERS DISTRUST
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

12:18.130 --> 12:19.791
THEY WOULD NEVER
HAVE COOPERATED

12:19.840 --> 12:22.297
IF WE'D BROUGHT THEM
INTO A POLICE STATION.

12:22.340 --> 12:23.534
PERHAPS NOT.

12:23.570 --> 12:25.128
AND ULTIMATELY,
THAT DECISION

12:25.170 --> 12:26.933
ALLOWED US TO FIND
THE PERSON

12:26.980 --> 12:29.369
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER
OF A LOCAL MAN.

12:29.410 --> 12:32.140
AT THE COST OF ANOTHER.

12:32.180 --> 12:33.977
AND THEN THERE'S
THE DEATH

12:34.020 --> 12:36.113
OF SSA STEPHEN WALKER,

12:36.150 --> 12:38.038
YOUR TEAM MEMBER.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.851
YOU WORKED WITH HIM
ON ASSIGNMENT IN FRANCE.

12:41.890 --> 12:44.552
YOU RECRUITED HIM
TO JOIN THE BAU.

12:44.590 --> 12:47.024
HE WAS AN EXEMPLARY AGENT.

12:47.060 --> 12:51.190
SSA WALKER WAS THE FIRST
AGENT TO DIE IN THE FIELD

12:51.230 --> 12:54.165
IN THE BAU'S
STORIED HISTORY.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.462
MAN: SO I CAN TELL YOU

12:56.500 --> 12:58.832
WHAT KIND OF
ACCELERANT HE USED.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.373
GOOD OLD DRUGSTORE VARIETY
RUBBING ALCOHOL.

13:01.410 --> 13:05.039
THAT'S WHY THE BURN PATTERNS
ON THE BODIES ARE SO UNEVEN.

13:05.080 --> 13:08.174
THESE AREN'T DEFENSIVE
WOUNDS, ARE THEY?

13:08.220 --> 13:11.940
NO. THE FLEXION
OF THE ELBOWS,
KNEES, AND HANDS

13:11.990 --> 13:13.582
IS CAUSED BY THE SHRINKAGE
OF BODY TISSUES

13:13.620 --> 13:14.951
DUE TO DEHYDRATION.

13:14.990 --> 13:17.925
SO THE PUGILISTIC POSE
IS A RESULT

13:17.960 --> 13:21.157
OF THE BODY BEING
EXPOSED TO EXTREME HEAT.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.896
YES. AND IT CAN OCCUR EVEN
IF THE BODIES WERE DEAD

13:25.170 --> 13:26.990
WHICH I BELIEVE
WAS THE CASE HERE.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.429
AND THE BLOODLETTING,
WAS THAT DONE
POSTMORTEM AS WELL?

13:29.470 --> 13:31.108
YES. HE SLICED THE CAROTID.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.835
NICE CLEAN CUT.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.008
SO THE UNSUB
IS SKILLED WITH A KNIFE.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.146
IF EXSANGUINATION WASN'T
THE CAUSE OF DEATH,
WHAT WAS?

13:39.180 --> 13:42.047
EACH VICTIM HAD LARGE
QUANTITIES OF PURE KETAMINE

13:42.080 --> 13:43.047
IN THEIR SYSTEM--

13:43.090 --> 13:44.910
A POWERFUL ANESTH ETIC.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.555
THEY WERE MOST LIKELY
INJECTED WITH
A PRETTY HEFTY DOSE.

13:47.590 --> 13:53.199
SO ALL THE VIOLENCE
DONE TO THE BODY
WAS POSTMORTEM.

13:53.230 --> 13:54.993
WHAT DO
YOU HAVE, ROSSI?

13:55.030 --> 13:56.861
A STRANGE CONTRADICT ION.

13:56.900 --> 14:00.233
THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS
A LETHAL DOSE OF KETAMINE.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.488
NOW, THESE KILLS
MAY LOOK EXTREME,

14:02.540 --> 14:06.499
BUT THE C.O.D. ITSELF
WAS PRACTICALLY PAINLESS.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.405
ALVEZ: WELL, IT'S DOUBTFUL
THE UNSUB WOULD EVEN

14:08.440 --> 14:11.341
NEED TO INTERACT OR CREATE
A RUSE WITH HIS VICTIMS.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.974
I MEAN, HE COULD JUST
SNEAK UP AND INJECT THEM.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.419
ALL RIGHT.
THAN KS, ROSSI.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.088
PRENTISS:
WE GAVE A FULL REPORT

14:17.120 --> 14:20.453
ON OUR YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION
TO APPREHEND MR. SCRATCH.

14:20.490 --> 14:23.254
STEPHEN WALKER'S WORK
WAS ESSENTIAL TO OUR CASE.

14:23.290 --> 14:26.088
YOUR TEAM DROVE
INTO AN AMBUSH.

14:26.130 --> 14:30.123
NO. WE SPENT MONTHS
ON THE OFFENSIVE

14:30.170 --> 14:33.435
LURING SCRATCH OUT OF
HIDING, AND IT WORKED.

14:33.470 --> 14:37.099
AGENT WALKER'S DEATH
WAS A TRAGEDY,
BUT IT WASN'T--

14:37.140 --> 14:40.268
ANYONE'S FAULT?
PREVENTABLE?

14:40.310 --> 14:42.107
I SPOKE WITH
AGENT WALKER'S WIDOW,

14:42.140 --> 14:45.200
AND YOU'RE LUCKY SHE'S
NOT SUING THE BUREAU
FOR NEGLIGENCE.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.377
WHAT WE HAVE HERE,
AGENT PRENTISS,

14:47.420 --> 14:49.638
IS A SERIES OF
QUESTIONABLE DECISIONS.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.989
YOU'RE NOT OUT IN THE FIELD.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.180
IT'S NOT BLACK AND WHITE.

14:53.220 --> 14:54.619
THESE ARE SNAP DECISIONS.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.220
OK. LET'S GO
BACK TO THE CASE

14:57.260 --> 14:58.921
THAT TRIGGERED
THIS REVIEW.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.155
I SPOKE WITH
AN OFFICER CABRERA
IN MATAMOROS, MEXICO.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.553
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.295
I DO.

15:04.330 --> 15:06.127
FOR OUR REPORTS,
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE

15:06.170 --> 15:08.138
THE RECORDING OF THAT
COGNITIVE INTERVIEW.

15:08.170 --> 15:10.263
I DIDN'T RECORD IT.

15:11.670 --> 15:15.299
PRENTISS: WHO HAS THE KNIFE?
WHO IS STABBING ROSA?

15:15.340 --> 15:17.103
REID: IT'S IN MY HAND.

15:17.150 --> 15:20.210
RIGHT NOW THIS IS JUST
MORE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.239
I TRUST YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.246
WE DO.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.158
BARNES: HE SAYS
YOU DELETED A VOICE MEMO

15:31.190 --> 15:33.192
IN WHICH AGENT REID
ALLEGEDLY CONFESSED

15:33.230 --> 15:35.289
TO THE MURDER
OF NADIE RAMOS.

15:35.330 --> 15:37.298
THAT'S NOT JUST
TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE.

15:37.330 --> 15:38.729
THAT'S OBSTRUCT ION
OF JUSTICE,

15:38.770 --> 15:42.433
CHARGES THAT COULD
END YOUR CAREER.

15:42.470 --> 15:45.166
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BREAK.

15:45.210 --> 15:48.008
JJ: OK, TWO MORE OF
THE INITIAL 10 VICTIMS

15:48.040 --> 15:49.371
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED--

15:49.410 --> 15:53.141
28-YEAR-OLD DENTIST
TYLER ROBERTS

15:53.180 --> 15:56.069
AND TEEN RUNAWAY
HEATHER PINEDA.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.485
ACCORDING TO
MISSING PERSON REPORTS

15:57.520 --> 15:59.511
AND THE TIMELINE
THE M.E. SENT OVER,

15:59.550 --> 16:02.110
THEY'RE MOST LIKELY
VICTIMS NUMBER 4 AND 5.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.151
THIS GUY'S VICTIMOLOGY'S
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

16:04.190 --> 16:05.157
I MEAN, HE'S BOUNCING
BACK AND FORTH

16:08.060 --> 16:10.028
THESE MAY ALL BE VICTIMS
OF OPPORTUNITY,

16:10.070 --> 16:11.526
BUT THERE'S A MEASURE OF
COMPASSION TO THESE KILLS.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.128
IT DOESN'T FEEL RANDOM.

16:13.170 --> 16:14.489
YEAH, HE DOESN'T
WANT THEM TO SUFFER.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.360
IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S
PUTTING THEM TO SLEEP.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.539
OR PUTTING THEM
OUT OF THEIR MISERY.

16:20.310 --> 16:22.335
THIS UNSUB HAS BEEN
BACK AND FORTH

16:22.380 --> 16:24.541
ACROSS THE CITY
AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY,

16:24.580 --> 16:27.344
SO HE'S CLEARLY USING SOME
KIND OF VEHICLE TO HUNT.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.211
HE'S MOST LIKELY
UNEMPLOYED.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.014
HE POSSESSES AN OVERWHELMING
NEED TO COMPLETE IT,

16:33.060 --> 16:35.278
ENOUGH TO RISK
GOING BACK TO THE AREA

16:35.320 --> 16:36.457
DESPITE A HEAW
POLICE PRESENCE.

16:36.490 --> 16:38.355
THESE CEMETERIES
ARE IMPORTANT TO HIM,

16:38.390 --> 16:40.699
IF NOT FOR PERSONAL REASONS,
THEN FOR WHAT THEY REPRESENT.

16:40.730 --> 16:43.665
SO DID HE LOSE SOMEONE?
IS THAT WHAT TRIGGERED
ALL OF THIS?

16:43.700 --> 16:46.294
WE SHOULD INCREASE PATROLS
IN AND AROUND THE GRAVEYARD

16:46.330 --> 16:48.036
AND WITHIN A TWO-MILE RADIUS,

16:48.070 --> 16:49.492
AND IF THEY ARE
IMPORTANT TO HIM,

16:49.540 --> 16:51.235
HE'LL PROBABLY REVISIT.

16:51.270 --> 16:52.669
AND KETAMINE
IS AVAILABLE ON THE STREET,

16:52.710 --> 16:54.268
BUT IT'S PRICEY,

16:54.310 --> 16:56.733
SO WE SHOULD ALSO CHECK
IN TO VET OFFICES,

16:56.780 --> 16:58.600
MEDICAL PROVIDERS,
SEE IF ANY OF THEM

16:58.650 --> 17:01.039
HAD ANY RECENT BREAK-INS.

18:10.250 --> 18:13.185
ALL RIGHT, THE VICTIM'S
NAME IS CARL KEVORK,

18:13.220 --> 18:15.279
AND HE ESCAPED THE CRASH
WITH ONLY MINOR INJURIES.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.288
THE EMTs WHO TRANSPORTED
HIM TO THE HOSPITAL

18:17.330 --> 18:18.581
SAID HE HAD BEEN
HEAVILY DRUGGED,

18:18.630 --> 18:20.825
MOST LIKELY KETAMINE,
LIKE THE OTHERS.

18:20.860 --> 18:23.397
CARL'S A BIG GUY.
THE UNSUB MUST HAVE
GOTTEN THE DOSAGE WRONG.

18:23.430 --> 18:24.499
WELL, CARL DOESN'T
REMEMBER MUCH.

18:24.530 --> 18:25.895
HE RECALLS
RUNNING DOWN AN ALLEY,

18:25.930 --> 18:27.659
SEEING A VAN,
GETTING INSIDE.

18:27.700 --> 18:28.860
WE PROFILED
HE'D BE UNEMPLOYED.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.538
IT LOOKS LIKE
OUR UNSUB'S BEEN LIVING

18:30.570 --> 18:32.162
OUT OF THIS VAN
FOR A WHILE.

18:32.210 --> 18:34.201
AND WHAT ABOUT BEFORE
YOU WERE DRUGGED, CARL?

18:34.240 --> 18:35.605
WHAT'S THE LAST THING
YOU RECALL?

18:35.640 --> 18:37.346
I WAS WAITING
FOR THE BUS, RIGHT?

18:37.380 --> 18:38.699
I JUST GOT DONE
WORKING AT THE SHACK.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.615
MY BOSS MADE ME
GO HOME EARLY

18:40.650 --> 18:42.379
BECAUSE HE SAID
I COULDN'T STOP
SNEEZING AND STUFF.

18:42.420 --> 18:43.648
I SAID IT WAS JUST
ALLERGIES,

18:43.690 --> 18:45.248
BUT HE MADE ME
GO HOME ANWVAY.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.383
SO I'M SITTING THERE,
I'M CHECKING MY PHONE,

18:47.420 --> 18:49.388
THEN THIS VAN PULLS UP,
BLOCKS THE BUS STOP.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.728
I'M LIKE, HEY,
YOU CAN'T PARK HERE.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.455
THEN THE DOOR
ON THE SIDE OPENED,

18:52.490 --> 18:54.151
AND I GOT, LIKE,
YANKED IN AND STUFF.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.519
DID YOU SEE YOUR ATTACKER?

18:55.560 --> 18:56.857
ONLY OUT OF THE CORNER
OF MY EYE.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.561
BUT THIS DUDE'S LIKE
A DAMN WEIRDO, MAN.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.261
HE HAD SOME KIND
OF FREAKY MASK ON

19:00.300 --> 19:02.666
WITH SOME
LONG BLACK GLOVES.

19:04.470 --> 19:05.732
GO AHEAD, GARCIA.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.238
GARCIA: I TRACKED THE VAN
VIA VIN NUMBER--
SAY THAT 3 TIMES FAST.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.407
THE VEHICLE WAS STOLEN FROM
HOUSTON, TEXAS, 8 YEARS AGO.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.644
AFTER THAT, I GOT NADA.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.409
WELL, THERE'S NO TELLING
IF OR HOW MANY TIMES

19:13.450 --> 19:14.644
IT'S CHANGED HANDS
SINCE.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.272
CAN YOU GET
THE POLICE REPORT

19:16.320 --> 19:17.514
AND TRACK DOWN
THE ORIGINAL OWNER?

19:17.550 --> 19:18.539
WILL DO.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.615
HEY, GARCIA,
ANYTHING FROM PRENTISS?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.878
MY CRAZY COVERT SOURCES SAY
THAT SHE WAS DONE WITH BARNES

19:22.920 --> 19:24.729
A FEW HOURS AGO,

19:24.760 --> 19:26.250
BUT EMILY'S LIGHT
IS STILL ON IN HER OFFICE

19:26.290 --> 19:27.791
AND I CAN'T TELL
IF IT'S A GOOD THING
OR IT'S BAD.

19:27.830 --> 19:30.594
WELL, SHE'S PROBABLY
JUST CATCHING UP
ON PAPERWORK.

19:30.630 --> 19:32.962
GARCIA: RIGHT. TOTALLY.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS
TELLING MYSELF, TOO.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.888
YEAH, OK. I'LL HIT YOU
BACK WHEN I HAVE MORE.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.191
THANKS, PENELOPE.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.434
REID: HEY, GUYS,

19:37.470 --> 19:38.903
GIVEN OUR GEO-PROFILE,

19:38.940 --> 19:40.737
I THINK I HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD GUESS

19:40.780 --> 19:42.600
AS TO WHERE OUR UNSUB
HAS BEEN HOLDING HIS VICTIMS.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.608
CARL WAS HEADED EAST, RIGHT?

19:59.730 --> 20:01.595
MEDICO DELLA PESTE.

20:01.630 --> 20:03.495
JEREMY PAULSON
AND CARL KEVORK

20:03.530 --> 20:06.727
BOTH DESCRIBED THEMSELVES
AS FEELING ILL BEFORE
THEY WERE ABDUCTED.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.761
YOU THINK THAT'S WHY
HE TARGETED THEM?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.233
AND IT'S HIS JOB
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM

20:10.270 --> 20:11.669
BEFORE THEY
CONTAMINATE OTHERS.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.679
HE'S RIDDING THE STREETS
OF THE INFECTED.

20:24.620 --> 20:29.717
HEY. JUST, UH, CHECKING IN
TO SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING.

20:32.390 --> 20:33.789
IT'S TOUGH
TO REMAIN CALM

20:33.830 --> 20:36.355
WHEN SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO GET UNDER YOUR SKIN.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.028
THIS ISN'T
AN ANNUAL REVIEW?

20:39.070 --> 20:41.891
OSTENSIBLY, YES,
BUT BARN ES

20:41.940 --> 20:43.635
HAS BEEN THROUGH
EVERY COMMAND DECISION
I'VE MADE

20:43.670 --> 20:45.399
SINCE TAKING
OVER AS UNIT CHIEF

20:45.440 --> 20:46.964
AND THROWN THEM
BACK AT ME,

20:47.010 --> 20:50.002
INCLUDING
STEPHEN'S DEATH.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.746
SHE'S TRYING TO RATTLE YOU.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.270
YEAH. SHE'S
AFTER SOMETHING.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.878
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.582
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT
YOUR BACK, RIGHT?

20:57.620 --> 20:58.985
I DO.

20:59.020 --> 21:00.658
SO HOW CAN WE HELP?

21:00.690 --> 21:02.510
SOLVE THIS CASE.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.529
SHOW BARNES WE CAN
COLOR WITHIN THE LINES.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.653
OK. WELL, HANG IN THERE.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.793
WHEN I GET BACK,
DRINKS ARE ON ME.

21:09.830 --> 21:11.889
DEAL.

21:11.930 --> 21:14.364
AND, EMILY,

21:14.400 --> 21:16.698
DON'T LET HER
PUSH YOU AROUND.

21:16.740 --> 21:18.503
YOU'VE EARNED THAT SEAT.

21:25.710 --> 21:28.713
SO THE UNSUB'S TRIGGER
IS SICKNESS,

21:28.750 --> 21:30.012
WHETHER REAL
OR PERCEIVED.

21:30.050 --> 21:31.847
ROSSI: EVERY VICTIM
WE'VE I.D.ed SO FAR

21:31.890 --> 21:34.609
HAD SYMPTOMS OF EITHER
A COLD OR ALLERGY.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.457
WHAT ABOUT THE DEAD
CHICKENS IN HIS LAIR?

21:36.490 --> 21:39.379
I MEAN, THEY CERTAINLY
POINT TOWARD SOME KIND
OF RITUAL IN MY BOOK.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.853
REID: THEY DO, BUT NOT
IN THE WAY THAT YOU THINK.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.049
MEDIEVAL MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS

21:43.100 --> 21:45.318
BELIEVED THAT CHICKENS
COULD ABSORB ILLNESS.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.531
THEY WOULD RUB THE BIRDS
ALL OVER THE BODIES
OF THE DISEASED

21:47.570 --> 21:49.458
IN AN ATTEMPT TO RID THEM
OF THEIR SICKNESS.

21:49.500 --> 21:52.867
THIS IS A VENETIAN
BIRD MASK.

21:52.910 --> 21:54.571
DURING THE 17th CENTURY,

21:54.610 --> 21:57.078
DOCTORS WOULD STUFF THESE
WITH HERBS AND SPICES

21:57.110 --> 21:59.704
AND WEAR THEM
TO PROTECT AGAINST INFECTION.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.445
FROM THE PLAGUE.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.913
REID: THAT ALONG WITH
THE BURNING OF THE BODIES

22:02.950 --> 22:05.544
AND THE BURIAL GROUND,
TREM CEMETERY NUMBER TWO,

22:05.590 --> 22:07.683
AND THE FACT IT WAS
ORIGINALLY BUILT

22:07.720 --> 22:10.553
TO HOUSE VICTIMS WHO DIED
FROM CHOLERA AND SMALLPOX,

22:10.590 --> 22:12.888
TELLS US THAT THIS UNSUB
BELIEVES HIMSELF TO BE

22:12.930 --> 22:14.955
A MODERN DAY PLAGUE DOCTOR.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.594
A VIGILANTE
OR ANGEL OF DEATH,

22:17.630 --> 22:19.769
WHOSE JOB IT IS
TO STOP SICK PEOPLE

22:19.800 --> 22:20.960
FROM SPREADING DISEASE.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.764
OUR UNSUB WANTS TO ERADICATE
NOT JUST THE SICK,

22:23.810 --> 22:25.459
BUT THE SICKNESS
WITHIN THEM.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.728
IN FACT, IT WASN'T
UNTIL THE MIDDLE
OF THE 19th CENTURY

22:27.780 --> 22:29.907
THAT HUMORISM, THE
BELIEF THAT ILLNESS

22:29.940 --> 22:31.601
WAS CAUSED
BY AN IMBALANCE

22:31.650 --> 22:32.878
OF THE FLUIDS
IN THE BODY,
WAS DISCREDITED.

22:32.910 --> 22:34.548
BEFORE THAT,
IT WAS BELIEVED

22:34.580 --> 22:35.945
THAT THERE WERE
4 HUMORS IN THE BODY--

22:35.980 --> 22:38.744
BLACK BILE, YELLOW BILE,
BLOOD, AND PHLEGM,

22:38.790 --> 22:40.678
ALL OF WHICH WERE
SUSCEPTIBLE TO MIASMA,

22:40.720 --> 22:42.654
OR BAD AIR,
THAT CARRIED DISEASE.

22:42.690 --> 22:46.524
ROSSI: OUR UNSUB'S FIXATION ON
THESE ANCIENT MEDICAL PRACTICES

22:46.560 --> 22:48.926
SPEAKS TO A VERY SPECIFIC
KIND OF STRESSOR.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.758
JJ: IT INDICATES A DISTRUST
IN MODERN MEDICINE.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.064
HE OR A LOVED ONE
MAY HAVE SUFFERED A LOSS

22:54.100 --> 22:56.568
BROUGHT ON BY ILLNESS
OR DISEASE.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.864
OR HE MAY BLAME
MODERN MEDICINE

22:58.910 --> 23:00.605
FOR FAILING TO SAVE
A LOVED ONE.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.803
JJ: OUR UNSUB WAS LIVING
ON THE FRINGES OF SOCIETY.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.909
HIS VAN WAS NOT JUST
HIS MEANS OF TRANSPORT,

23:05.950 --> 23:07.474
IT WAS HIS WHOLE LIFE.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.010
AND NOW THAT HE'S LOST IT,

23:09.050 --> 23:11.848
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT HE'LL DO NEXT.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.949
THE BACTERIA
WILL GET INTO THE BLOOD.

23:13.990 --> 23:15.958
THE BACTERIA WILL GET
INTO THE BLOOD.

23:18.690 --> 23:21.124
THE BACTERIA
WILL GET INTO THE BLOOD.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.593
THE BACTERIA

23:22.630 --> 23:24.495
WILL GET INTO THE BLOOD.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.689
MAN: THE BACTERIA
HAS GOTTEN INTO YOUR BLOOD.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.068
WOMAN:
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

23:32.110 --> 23:33.577
YOU'RE VERY SICK.

23:33.610 --> 23:34.736
THE STORMS
HAVE BROUGHT FORTH

23:34.780 --> 23:37.499
VARIOUS PLAGUES AND DISEASES
WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN CENTURIES.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.074
YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
IS WEAK.

23:39.110 --> 23:42.216
A BAD COLD COULD LAND YOU
IN INTENSIVE CARE OR WORSE.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.844
GET REGULAR CHECK-UPS,
TAKE YOUR MEDS.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.414
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

23:52.930 --> 23:54.898
IT'S OK, MAMA.

23:54.930 --> 23:57.694
WHEN I GROW UP,
I'M GONNA BECOME A DOCTOR,

23:57.730 --> 23:59.163
AND I'LL FIND A WAY
TO MAKE YOU BETTER.

23:59.200 --> 24:04.035
A DOCTOR?
THAT'LL SUIT YOU
JUST FINE.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.930
IT WAS THEIR FAULT.

24:06.970 --> 24:08.506
THEY DIDN'T HELP HER.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.906
THEY DIDN'T LISTEN TO HER.
IT WAS THEIR FAULT.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.099
THEY DIDN'T HELP HER!

24:12.150 --> 24:14.141
IT WAS THEIR FAULT...

24:14.180 --> 24:16.011
IT WAS THEIR FAULT!

24:16.050 --> 24:17.711
IT WAS THEM.

24:17.750 --> 24:19.012
THEY DIDN'T HELP.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.880
I'D LIKE TO PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF YESTERDAY.

24:26.930 --> 24:28.192
NO. LET'S NOT.

24:28.230 --> 24:31.028
THIS IS NOT ABOUT OUR CASE
IN MEXICO LAST YEAR

24:31.070 --> 24:32.697
OR ANY OTHER CASES.

24:32.730 --> 24:33.936
THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

24:33.970 --> 24:35.267
YOU WANT SOMETHING.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.961
I WANT THE BAU
TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

24:37.000 --> 24:38.558
FOR ITS ACTIONS.

24:38.610 --> 24:39.907
IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE

24:39.940 --> 24:41.532
THAT WE ACT ED
INAPPROPRIATELY

24:41.580 --> 24:44.504
OR HAD EVIDENCE
OF A CRIME
THAT WAS COMMITTED,

24:44.550 --> 24:46.040
YOU WOULD HAVE
HAD ME ARRESTED.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.877
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVEN'T

24:47.920 --> 24:49.512
TELLS ME THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU'RE AFTER.

24:49.550 --> 24:50.847
NO?

24:50.890 --> 24:54.883
NO. YOUR SPECIALTY
IS REMAKING UNITS

24:54.920 --> 24:57.559
AND DIVISIONS
IN YOUR IMAGE--

24:57.590 --> 25:00.753
SLIMMING THEM DOWN,
DIVIDING THEIR RESOURCES,

25:00.800 --> 25:03.963
SO YOU CAN MAXIMIZE
THEIR EFFICIENCY.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.662
YOU WANT TO MAKE
A NAME FOR YOURSELF.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.895
EVERYTHING ABOUT
YOUR DEMEANOR SAYS

25:08.940 --> 25:10.805
"I WANT TO BE IN CHARGE."

25:10.840 --> 25:14.901
AND YOU PROJECT POWER
NOT BECAUSE YOU FEAR
YOU DON'T HAVE IT,

25:14.940 --> 25:17.602
BUT BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T GET ENOUGH.

25:17.650 --> 25:20.278
YOU WANT TO BE
THE DIRECTOR SOMEDAY.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.073
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE,

25:22.120 --> 25:26.784
TO APPEASE YOUR EGO,
YOUR AM BITION.

25:26.820 --> 25:30.017
HAVE YOU ALWAYS HAD
ISSUES WITH AUTHORITY?

25:31.730 --> 25:34.028
BETTER AGENTS THAN YOU

25:34.060 --> 25:36.858
HAVE TRIED TO SPLIT
THE BAU AND FAILED.

25:36.900 --> 25:40.666
EACH TIME, THE BAU
HAS DONE ITS JOB,

25:40.700 --> 25:42.895
AND DONE IT WELL,
AND SO HAVE I.

25:42.940 --> 25:44.339
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT'S GOTTEN ME?

25:44.370 --> 25:46.099
RESPECT,

25:46.140 --> 25:47.334
SUPPORT,

25:47.370 --> 25:49.577
AND CAPITAL.

25:49.610 --> 25:53.307
SO WHATEVER GAME IT IS
YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY HERE,

25:53.350 --> 25:55.545
I WANT NO PART OF IT.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.849
WHY DON'T WE TAKE
A BREAK

25:59.890 --> 26:02.984
BEFORE YOU SAY SOMETHING
YOU WILL REGRET?

26:03.020 --> 26:04.681
CSU TECHS BELIEVE
THE UNSUB

26:04.730 --> 26:06.982
SCRUBBED THE VAN CLEAN
AFTER EACH VICTIM.

26:07.030 --> 26:08.850
AND WHILE WE DID FIND
SOME DNA,

26:08.900 --> 26:10.356
IT WASN'T THE WINDFALL
WE WERE HOPING.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.129
FOR A GUY LIVING
OUT OF HIS VAN,

26:12.170 --> 26:13.865
HE SURE KEPT
THINGS NEAT.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.936
ALVEZ: WE FOUND MEN
AND WOMEN'S CLOTHING

26:15.970 --> 26:17.062
AND PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

26:17.100 --> 26:19.000
THE ITEMS LOOK
TO BE DATED,

26:19.040 --> 26:20.974
BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES
SPEAK TO THE FACT

26:21.010 --> 26:22.238
THAT THE UNSUB
LOST SOMEONE--

26:22.280 --> 26:25.875
SOMEONE CLOSE,
PROBABLY A WIFE OR A MOM,

26:25.910 --> 26:27.377
MAYBE A SISTER.

26:27.410 --> 26:30.140
WE GOT NEBULIZERS
AND CORTICOSTEROIDS
AND A FEW OTHERS.

26:30.180 --> 26:32.944
SOME ARE CURRENT.
SOME EXPIRED AS
FAR BACK AS 2008.

26:32.990 --> 26:34.082
NO IDENTIFYING
INFORMATION.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.884
IT LOOKS LIKE A YEAR'S
WORTH OF MEDICATION.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.251
THIS PERSON WAS SICK
A LONG TIME.

26:38.290 --> 26:39.780
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
TOUGH TO GO THROUGH,

26:39.830 --> 26:41.127
ESPECIALLY IN
CLOSE QUARTERS.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.320
YOU KNOW, MOST OF
THESE ARE USED TO TREAT

26:42.360 --> 26:43.827
A LUNG CONDITION OR
BREATHING AILMENT.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.919
BUT THIS ONE, CHOLESTYRAMINE,
IS INTERESTING.

26:46.970 --> 26:49.359
CHOLESTYRAMINE HAS
MANY OFF-LABEL USES,

26:49.400 --> 26:52.107
PARTICULARLY AS A BINDING
AGENT FOR BIOTOXINS.

26:52.140 --> 26:54.938
SIMMONS: BIOTOXINS.
LIKE MOLD OR FUNGI?

26:54.980 --> 26:56.675
ALONG WITH CYANOBACTERIA,
DINOFLAGELLATES,

26:56.710 --> 26:59.042
SPIROCHETES,
APICOMPLEXANS,
AND MYCOTOXINS,

26:59.080 --> 27:00.377
ALL OF WHICH
CAN MAKE YOU VERY SICK.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.741
AND THESE WOULD BE
RARE CONDITIONS?

27:01.780 --> 27:03.145
INCREDIBLY RARE.

27:03.180 --> 27:05.011
JJ: THIS COULD HELP GARCIA
NARROW DOWN OUR SEARCH.

27:05.050 --> 27:06.779
I'LL CALL HER.
THANK YOU.

27:06.820 --> 27:08.151
OK, SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS.

27:08.190 --> 27:09.418
HE HAS NO MEANS
OF TRANSPORTATION,

27:09.460 --> 27:11.018
AND HE HAS NOWHERE
TO TAKE HIS VICTIMS,

27:11.060 --> 27:12.652
SO OUR UNSUB
IS STARTING OVER AGAIN.

27:12.690 --> 27:14.191
SO, WHAT DOES HE DO NOW?

27:14.230 --> 27:15.754
DOES HE STEAL ANOTHER VAN?

27:15.800 --> 27:16.926
NO. TOO RISKY.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.167
SIMMONS: THIS IS A GUY
GOING THROUGH
THE STAGES OF GRIEF.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.792
SO MAYBE ANGER'S NEXT.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.331
WELL, HE COULD START
TO LASH OUT, FOCUS HIS RAGE.

27:23.370 --> 27:26.100
ESPECIALLY
IF HE FINDS HIMSELF
NEAR A HOSPITAL

27:26.140 --> 27:28.131
OR A PHARMACY.
ANYWHERE THERE'S
SICK PEOPLE.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.001
JJ: OK, LET'S PUT A WARNING
OUT TO HOSPITALS AND CLINICS

27:31.050 --> 27:33.006
TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT
FOR ANY SUSPICIOUS PERSONS

27:33.050 --> 27:34.369
LOITERING IN THE AREA,

27:34.420 --> 27:35.910
SEE IF THEY CAN POST
EXTRA SECURITY

27:35.950 --> 27:37.110
AT ALL ENTRANCES
AND EXITS.

27:37.150 --> 27:38.742
WE'LL GET ON IT.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.109
THANK YOU.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.143
HI. I WAS JUST
CLOSING UP FOR LUNCH.

28:07.180 --> 28:08.147
DO YOU MIND
COMING BACK IN--

28:08.180 --> 28:09.943
THAT WOMAN WAS SICK.

28:09.980 --> 28:13.108
SHE WAS CONTAMINATED,
AND YOU JUST LET HER LEAVE.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.482
YES. I GAVE HER
SOME MEDICINE.
DO YOU NEED...

28:15.520 --> 28:17.078
THAT MEDICINE
CAN'T HELP HER.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.020
SHE'S CONTAMINATED.

28:19.060 --> 28:20.755
YOU CAN'T HELP HER.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.097
YOU COULDN'T HELP
MY MOTHER.

28:22.130 --> 28:26.499
NO. ALL DOCTORS DO
IS MAKE PEOPLE SUFFER,

28:26.530 --> 28:29.397
MAKE THEM LIVE
WITH FALSE HOPE.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.965
SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST
GET SICK, AND THERE'S--

28:32.010 --> 28:34.069
MY MOTHER DIDN'T
JUST GET SICK!

28:34.110 --> 28:37.102
SHE WAS MADE SICK.

28:37.140 --> 28:39.074
THAT BACTERIA
GOT IN HER BLOOD

28:39.110 --> 28:42.170
AND NONE OF YOU
DID ANYTHING.

28:47.550 --> 28:51.225
AAH! STOP IT! OH! NO, NO!

28:51.260 --> 28:53.353
GET OFF...

29:02.070 --> 29:05.005
LEWIS: SO THE BURNING WAS
POSTMORTEM, LIKE THE OTHERS?

29:05.040 --> 29:07.406
YES, BUT C.O.D.
WAS A STAB WOUND
TO THE BACK.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.101
WELL, JUST AS WE PREDICT ED.

29:09.140 --> 29:12.109
THIS IS OUR GUY. HE'S
GONE WILDLY OFF PATTERN.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.243
BURNED THE CLINIC,
ATTACKED THE DOCTOR HERE.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.043
HE'S DEVOLVING.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.786
WELL, MAYBE
HE FINALLY FIGURED OUT

29:17.820 --> 29:20.015
THAT KILLING SICK PEOPLE
WON'T STOP THE SPREAD
OF DISEASE.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.314
ROSSI: THE CLINIC WAS
PROBABLY A STARK REMINDER

29:22.360 --> 29:24.180
OF THE FAILURE
OF MODERN MEDICINE.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.221
IT SHOWS AN EVOLUTION
OF THOUGHT,

29:26.260 --> 29:28.228
AND HE'S GONE FROM
PUTTING THE BLAMELESS
OUT OF THEIR MISERY

29:28.260 --> 29:30.319
TO PUNISHING THOSE
IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.499
HE'S NO LONGER
ON A MISSION OF MERCY,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.191
THIS COULD VERY
QUICKLY BECOME

29:34.240 --> 29:36.390
ABOUT FINDING
THAT PERSON THAT HE THINKS

29:36.440 --> 29:39.307
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE LOSS HE SUFFERED.

29:45.110 --> 29:46.407
HERE YOU GO.

29:46.450 --> 29:47.508
OH, THANK YOU.

29:47.550 --> 29:49.245
OF COURSE.

29:52.620 --> 29:55.054
I JUST KEEP
SITTING HERE,

29:55.090 --> 29:57.957
HOPING FOR
A REVELATION.

29:57.990 --> 30:00.049
OH, THIS GUY'S ELUSIVE.

30:00.090 --> 30:03.150
WE FOUND HIS HOME,
SECONDARY LOCATION,

30:03.200 --> 30:07.296
MEANS OF TRANSPORT
BUT NOT HIS NAME.

30:07.330 --> 30:09.093
HE FEELS INVISIBLE.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.301
BUT IT COULDN'T HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE,

30:11.340 --> 30:12.500
YOU KNOW?

30:12.540 --> 30:14.178
AT SOME POINT,
THIS GUY,

30:14.210 --> 30:16.872
HE HAD FRIENDS
AND FAMILY.

30:26.390 --> 30:29.917
HE LOST SOMEONE
IMPORTANT TO HIM.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.849
SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

30:32.890 --> 30:34.357
THIS TIMELINE.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.095
WE NEED TO GO BACK

30:36.130 --> 30:37.449
TO WHERE IT ALL
STARTED FOR OUR UNSUB,

30:37.500 --> 30:40.936
WITH HIS FIRST VICTIM,
HUNTER DILLON.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.207
NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD A CHANCE
TO GATHER YOURSELF...

30:47.510 --> 30:49.876
I WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK
TO THE TASK AT HAND,

30:49.910 --> 30:52.504
BECAUSE I MAY BE
AMBITIOUS,

30:52.550 --> 30:55.041
BUT I'VE READ YOUR FILE,
AGENT PRENTISS,

30:55.080 --> 30:57.378
AND THERE'S MORE
OF ME IN YOU THAN
YOU'D LIKE TO ADMIT.

30:57.420 --> 30:58.887
BUT THE BAU
IS NOT INFALLIBLE

30:58.920 --> 31:00.387
AND I'D LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR TEAM

31:00.420 --> 31:02.081
AND THEIR ROLE
IN ALL OF THIS.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.452
I'M THE UNIT CHIEF.
THE BUCK STOPS WITH ME.

31:04.490 --> 31:08.392
SURE. BUT AGENT ROSSI
HAS JUST PUBLISHED
ANOTHER BOOK.

31:08.430 --> 31:10.352
HE'S BEEN SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME
WITH HIS FAMILY.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.096
PERHAPS HE HASN'T
ALWAYS BEEN AS FOCUSED
AS HE COULD BE.

31:13.130 --> 31:16.531
AND AGENT REID'S BEEN
BUSY WITH HIS TEACHING
ASSIGNMENT.

31:16.570 --> 31:19.403
ACADEMIA IS
A MORE NATURAL FIT

31:19.440 --> 31:20.976
FOR AN INTELLECT
LIKE HIS.

31:21.010 --> 31:22.898
I THINK EVEN HE WOULD
AGREE WITH THAT.

31:22.940 --> 31:24.373
WAIT. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS,

31:24.410 --> 31:27.140
A...FISHING EXPEDITION?

31:28.350 --> 31:30.079
MY INVESTIGATION
HAS REVEALED

31:30.120 --> 31:33.419
A PATTERN OF NEGLIGENCE
WITHIN THE BAU.

31:33.450 --> 31:37.386
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
A FALL GUY?

31:37.420 --> 31:39.456
SO THE BUREAU CAN AVOID
SOME BAD PR

31:39.490 --> 31:42.152
AND YOU CAN GET A WIN.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.464
YOU THOUGHT IF
YOU THREATENED MY CAREER

31:44.500 --> 31:45.569
THAT I'D PLAY BALL.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.591
ROSSI PUT HIMSELF
IN CHARGE

31:47.630 --> 31:49.461
FOLLOWING
YOUR ABDUCTION.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.162
REID SPENT MONTHS
IN A FEDERAL PRISON.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.508
NEITHER ARE GOOD
AT FOLLOWING THE RULES.

31:54.540 --> 31:55.939
THEY'RE INDISPENSABLE.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.948
THEY ARE
LOOSE CANNONS!

31:57.980 --> 32:00.949
I AM ASKING YOU
TO SACRIFICE
A COUPLE OF PIECES

32:00.980 --> 32:03.414
TO SAVE THE WHOLE BOARD.

32:03.450 --> 32:06.487
I STAND BY MY TEAM
AND THE ACTIONS WE'VE TAKEN.

32:13.290 --> 32:16.999
WE THOUGHT OUR UNSUB
WAS ON A MISSION
TO CLEANSE THE STREETS,

32:17.030 --> 32:19.089
BUT IT'S WAY MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

32:19.130 --> 32:20.597
THIS WHOLE RITUAL OF HIS

32:20.630 --> 32:22.734
IS AN ACT OF MERCY
IN HIS MIND.

32:22.770 --> 32:24.635
IT DIDN'T JUST
COME OUT OF THIN AIR.

32:24.670 --> 32:26.365
I THINK HE'S BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT,

32:26.410 --> 32:27.468
PREPARING FOR IT
IN SOME WAY.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.432
EXACTLY. BUT WE HAVEN'T
FOUND ANYTHING

32:29.480 --> 32:33.974
CONNECTING OUR UNSUB
TO THE FIRST BODY,
HUNTER DILLON.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.647
WHAT IF HUNTER
WASN'T HIS FIRST VICTIM?

32:35.680 --> 32:37.443
THAT WOULD MEAN
THERE'S ANOTHER VICTIM
OUT THERE

32:37.480 --> 32:39.038
WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED.

32:39.090 --> 32:40.580
JJ: OK,
SO OUR UNSUB STARTED

32:40.620 --> 32:42.212
BY PUTTING PEOPLE
OUT OF THEIR MISERY,

32:42.260 --> 32:44.626
SAVING THEM
FROM THEIR SICKNESS.

32:44.660 --> 32:48.221
WHAT IF THE WOMAN
HE LOST, WHO WAS SICK,

32:48.260 --> 32:49.750
DIDN'T JUST DIE,

32:49.800 --> 32:51.665
BUT SHE WAS HIS FIRST KILL?

32:51.700 --> 32:53.122
THEN EVERYTHING
HE'S DONE SINCE

32:53.170 --> 32:54.398
WOULD BE ABOUT
RELIVING THAT MOMENT,

32:54.440 --> 32:55.429
JUSTIFYING THAT ACTION.

32:55.470 --> 32:58.405
THESE MURDERS WOULD BE
ABOUT EASING HIS OWN GUILT.

32:58.440 --> 33:01.170
THERE'S PLENTY OF EVIDENCE
OF THIS WOMAN IN THE VAN.

33:01.210 --> 33:02.700
JUST NO DNA AND NO PRINTS.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.640
OK, WHAT ABOUT
HER BELONGINGS?

33:04.680 --> 33:06.045
REID: WE HAVE CLOTHES
AND BLANKETS.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.344
ALVEZ: A SMALL JEWELRY BOX.

33:08.380 --> 33:09.642
SIMMONS: SOME TOILETRIES.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.545
JJ: AND THIS BOUQUET.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.785
WHY WOULD SOMEONE KEEP
DEAD, ROTTING FLOWERS?

33:13.820 --> 33:15.356
IT COULD BE OF PERSONAL
SIGNIFICANCE,

33:15.390 --> 33:16.550
AN EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT
THAT OVERRIDES

33:16.590 --> 33:17.852
HIS COMPULSION
FOR CLEANLINESS.

33:17.890 --> 33:21.656
OK, DID THE CSUS FIND
ANY PRINTS OR DNA
ON THE PLASTIC WRAPPING?

33:21.700 --> 33:23.497
NO. BUT THE WRAPPING
DID HAVE A LABEL

33:23.530 --> 33:25.020
THAT LED
TO A FLOWER SHOP.

33:25.070 --> 33:27.391
THE CSUS FOLLOWED UP
BUT CAME UP
EMPTY-HANDED.

33:27.430 --> 33:29.489
THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE NOT PENELOPE.

33:29.540 --> 33:31.167
GARCIA, WE NEED YOUR HELP.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.404
BRING IT.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.106
YES, I SENT THE FLOWERS.

33:37.140 --> 33:40.348
TANESA WINTERS
WAS MY NEIGHBOR.

33:40.380 --> 33:42.575
I WAS DEVASTATED

33:42.620 --> 33:45.487
WHEN I GOT THE WORD
THAT SHE PASSED.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.112
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
KNOWN TAN ESA?

33:47.150 --> 33:49.186
OH, GOSH,
A LONG TIME.

33:49.220 --> 33:50.687
I MET HER AFTER KATRINA.

33:50.720 --> 33:54.224
SHE WAS STRUGGLING
TO GET BACK ON HER FEET
AFTER THE STORM.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.493
OVER ON FIG AND 44th.

33:59.530 --> 34:01.236
WHEN WAS THAT?

34:01.270 --> 34:03.659
OH, ABOUT
10 YEARS AGO.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.668
BUT THEN
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.598
THE BUILDING
GOT CONDEMNED.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.438
TANESA CAME
INTO SOME MONEY.

34:10.480 --> 34:13.472
UH-HUH. AND HER
SON KEVON CAME
TO STAY WITH HER.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.148
THEY LIVED RIGHT
OVER THERE.

34:15.180 --> 34:18.411
I TRIED TO HELP HER
WHEN I COULD. BUT...

34:18.450 --> 34:20.543
THEY FELL ON HARD TIMES?

34:20.590 --> 34:23.309
COULDN'T AFFORD
TO KEEP UP
WITH THEIR BILLS.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.420
THEY SAID THAT TANESA
DIED IN HER SLEEP.

34:26.460 --> 34:29.429
I HOPE SHE FINALLY
FOUND SOME PEACE.

34:29.460 --> 34:32.588
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR TALKING TO US, EDNA.

34:35.170 --> 34:39.664
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
EVERYTHING WE CAN
ABOUT KEVON WINTERS.

34:39.710 --> 34:44.875
SHE SAID SOMETHING HAPPENED
10 YEARS AGO. 2008.

34:44.910 --> 34:48.573
THAT'S WHEN THE MEDICATION
IN THE UNSUB'S VAN
DATES BACK TO.

34:48.620 --> 34:51.817
I WONDER IF THAT'S
WHEN TANESA GOT SICK.

34:54.460 --> 34:55.688
TALK TO ME, MY PRETTIES.

34:55.720 --> 34:56.755
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US

34:56.790 --> 34:59.224
ABOUT TANESA
AND KEVON WINTERS?

34:59.260 --> 35:02.354
OK. TANESA WINTERS.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.618
SHE DIED 3 WEEKS AGO.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.797
SHE'S SURVIVED BY
HER SON KEVON.

35:06.830 --> 35:09.298
IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS
BORN IN NEW ORLEANS.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.365
UH, HE SPENT SOME TIME
IN HOUSTON,

35:11.410 --> 35:12.866
BUT HE RETURNED
AT SOME POINT,

35:12.910 --> 35:15.708
BECAUSE I'VE GOT A LOCAL
COLLEGE TRANSCRIPT

35:15.740 --> 35:17.571
AND A NOTICE FROM
A COLLECTION AGENCY.

35:17.610 --> 35:20.147
KEVON DROPPED OUT
OF SCHOOL,

35:20.180 --> 35:21.670
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
IN DEBT.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.347
THAT'S WHEN THE TRAIL
GOES COLD.

35:23.380 --> 35:24.881
WE ALSO NEED INFORMATION
ON THIS FLOPHOUSE.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.241
IT WAS CONDEMNED
ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO.

35:27.290 --> 35:28.689
IT'S ON 44th AND FIG.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.187
I CAN TELL YOU
IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE.

35:30.220 --> 35:32.154
IT'S NOW A COFFEE SHOP.

35:32.190 --> 35:34.499
LET ME TAKE A DEEP DIVE HERE

35:34.530 --> 35:35.929
AND SEE WHAT SECRET
SECRETS I CAN FIND.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.167
WE BELIEVE
TANESA WINTERS LIVED THERE

35:38.200 --> 35:39.497
FOR A SHORT TIME.

35:39.530 --> 35:40.690
YEAH, SHE DID.

35:40.730 --> 35:42.698
THE TENANTS THERE
FILED A CIVIL SUIT.

35:42.740 --> 35:46.665
IT LOOKS LIKE TANESA
WAS THE PRIMARY PLAINTIFF.

35:46.710 --> 35:49.599
THEY SUED FOR NEGLIGENCE
AND BODILY HARM.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.801
THAT BUILDING SUSTAINED
A LOT OF DAMAGE

35:51.850 --> 35:53.772
AFTER THE FLOODING
CAUSED BY KATRINA.

35:53.810 --> 35:56.847
LET ME GUESS.
IT WAS NEVER PROPERLY
CLEANED OR VENTED.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.643
IT WAS NOT.

35:58.690 --> 36:02.182
TANESA BECAME VERY ILL
DUE TO BLACK MOLD.

36:02.220 --> 36:05.189
THE RESIDENTS REPEATEDLY
ASKED FOR THE BUILDING,
TO BE INSPECTED

36:05.230 --> 36:07.790
AND THE LANDLORD
AND THE INSURANCE
COMPANIES IGNORED THEM.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.855
THAT'S IT. THAT'S
THE UNSUB'S STRESSOR.

36:09.900 --> 36:11.720
THAT'S THE ROOT
OF ALL OF THIS.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.692
WHAT EVER HAPPENED
TO THE LANDLORD
WHO OWNED THE BUILDING?

36:13.730 --> 36:17.689
WALTER TRUDEAU PAID OUT
A MODEST SETTLEMENT

36:17.740 --> 36:19.799
AND WENT ON TO BECOME
A LOCAL BUSINESS MOGUL.

36:22.540 --> 36:24.542
IF THE UNSUB IS NOW
DIRECTING HIS ANGER

36:24.580 --> 36:25.842
TO THOSE HE
HOLDS RESPONSIBLE

36:25.880 --> 36:27.700
FOR FAILING TO HELP
HIS MOTHER,

36:27.750 --> 36:29.672
WALTER TRUDEAU
WILL BE ON THAT LIST.

36:29.720 --> 36:30.914
YEAH, WE NEED TO WARN HIM.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.542
PENELOPE, CAN YOU
GET AHOLD OF MR. TRUDEAU

36:32.590 --> 36:33.739
AND LET HIM KNOW
THAT WE'D LIKE
TO SPEAK TO HIM?

36:33.790 --> 36:34.757
AND SEND US--

36:34.790 --> 36:36.257
HIS HOME
AND WORK ADDRESS?

36:36.290 --> 36:37.712
IT'S LIKE I DO THIS
FOR A LIVING.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.227
AND--OH! FLAG ON THE PLAY.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.682
SPORTS REFERENCE.

36:40.730 --> 36:43.597
TRUDEAU SPENDS A LOT OF
TIME AT A BAR HE OWNS.

36:43.630 --> 36:44.927
I'M SENDING YOU
THE ADDRESS NOW.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.996
GARCIA, BEFORE YOU GO,
FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAN

36:48.030 --> 36:51.864
ABOUT TANESA WINTERS' DEATH,
SPECIFICALLY THE CAUSE.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.400
COPY THAT. HERE IT COMES.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.907
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

36:54.940 --> 36:58.398
SO YOU THINK I'M IN TROUBLE.

36:58.450 --> 36:59.701
JJ: WELL, YOU
MAY BE TARGETED

36:59.750 --> 37:01.809
BECAUSE OF THIS PRIOR
LAWSUIT AND YOUR HISTORY

37:01.850 --> 37:03.249
WITH THE WINTERS FAMILY.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.508
THIS WAS OVER
10 YEARS AGO.

37:07.550 --> 37:09.757
PEOPLE HAVE MOVED ON.
THEY'VE REBUILT.

37:09.790 --> 37:13.453
IT'S WHAT MY LAWYERS CALL
TAKING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.

37:13.490 --> 37:15.355
KEVON: WALTER TRUDEAU,

37:15.400 --> 37:16.992
SHOW YOURSELF!

37:17.030 --> 37:19.464
MAN: HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:19.500 --> 37:23.664
OHH! AAH! UGH! UH!

37:23.700 --> 37:25.463
KEVON: WALTER TRUDEAU!

37:33.380 --> 37:34.847
TRUDEAU, COME OR I WILL

37:34.880 --> 37:36.370
BURN THIS PLACE
TO THE GROUND!

37:36.420 --> 37:37.876
THERE'S NO TELLING
HOW MUCH

37:37.920 --> 37:39.478
GASOLINE VAPOR'S
IN THE AIR.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.839
WE TAKE A SHOT,
WE COULD THROW

37:40.890 --> 37:42.585
THIS WHOLE ROOM
UP IN FLAMES.

37:42.620 --> 37:44.019
WE GOT TO APPROACH
THIS TACTICALLY.

37:44.060 --> 37:45.857
LET'S GET
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
OUT HERE ASAP.

37:45.890 --> 37:47.448
WHAT CAN I DO?
WHAT CAN I DO?

37:47.490 --> 37:49.924
NOTHING. JUST STAY OUT
OF SIGHT. LET US DO OUR JOB.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.666
IS THAT ANOTHER WAY
DOWNSTAIRS?

37:51.700 --> 37:52.826
YEAH. IT'S THE FIRE ESCAPE.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.019
IT TAKES YOU AROUND BACK.

37:54.070 --> 37:54.889
ALL RIGHT, DAVE,
I'LL BUY US TIME.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.635
I'M ON IT.

38:01.610 --> 38:02.929
GARCIA: YES, SIR.

38:02.980 --> 38:03.935
GARCIA, WHAT DID YOU
FIND OUT

38:03.980 --> 38:06.608
ABOUT TANESA WINTERS' DEATH?

38:07.980 --> 38:09.811
KEVON WINTERS.

38:09.850 --> 38:11.386
DON'T COME
ANY FURTHER. STOP.

38:11.420 --> 38:14.685
I'M SSA JENNIFER JAREAU.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.551
WHERE'S TRUDEAU?

38:17.820 --> 38:20.027
KEVON, I...

38:20.060 --> 38:23.928
I UNDERSTAND YOU LOST
YOUR MOTHER RECENTLY.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.861
I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

38:28.400 --> 38:32.962
MY--MY HUSBAND
LOST HIS DAD TO KATRINA.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.535
THE STORM DIDN'T
TAKE MY MOTHER.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.400
IT WAS TRUDEAU.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.500
THAT BUILDING WASN'T SAFE,
AND HE KNEW.

38:40.550 --> 38:42.814
THEY ALL KNEW!

38:42.850 --> 38:44.943
THE DOCTORS,
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES,

38:44.990 --> 38:46.048
BUT IT WAS TRUDEAU.

38:46.090 --> 38:49.116
HE HID IT FROM US.
HE LIED.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.628
AND IF HE WOULD HAVE DONE
WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO,

38:51.660 --> 38:53.355
MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE
NEVER GOTTEN SICK.

38:53.390 --> 38:54.926
SHE'D STILL BE HERE!

38:54.960 --> 38:58.054
YOU'RE RIGHT. TRUDEAU
DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT THING.

38:58.100 --> 39:01.695
HE DIDN'T, BUT YOU--
YOU CAN, OK?

39:01.740 --> 39:03.628
YOU CAN LET THIS
INNOCENT MAN GO.

39:03.670 --> 39:07.936
NO, NO, NO, NO!
HE HAS TO FACE ME!

39:07.970 --> 39:10.029
MOVE.

39:12.980 --> 39:16.017
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

39:16.050 --> 39:18.644
DON'T. DON'T YOU DARE!

39:18.690 --> 39:20.749
HER DEATH WAS A TRAGEDY.

39:20.790 --> 39:22.610
IT WAS YOUR FAULT,

39:22.660 --> 39:24.878
AND NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
TO SUFFER!

39:24.930 --> 39:26.079
HEY, YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.927
IT'S HIS TURN
TO LOSE SOMETHING!

39:27.960 --> 39:31.691
TRUDEAU DIDN'T KILL
YOUR MOTHER, KEVON.

39:31.730 --> 39:33.960
WE READ THE
CORONER'S REPORT.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.661
IT SAID SHE DIED
IN HER SLEEP,

39:35.700 --> 39:37.839
BUT THAT'S NOT THE
WHOLE STORY, IS IT?

39:37.870 --> 39:41.499
IT WAS YOU.

39:41.540 --> 39:43.098
YOU GAVE HER...

39:43.140 --> 39:44.402
A LETHAL DOSE OF KETAMINE.

39:44.450 --> 39:46.873
I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN STRONGER.

39:46.910 --> 39:50.778
BUT I COULDN'T LOSE HER.
SHE WAS ALL I HAD.

39:50.820 --> 39:52.048
AND I LET HER SUFFER.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.981
NO. I--

39:56.020 --> 39:59.649
UGH! AAH!
JJ: OK.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.658
IT'S OK, SON. IT'S OK.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.019
IT'S OK, SON, IT'S OK.

40:03.060 --> 40:06.029
IT'S OK. IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.958
IT'S OK.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.092
AAH!

40:09.140 --> 40:11.096
IT'S OK.

40:14.540 --> 40:16.633
JJ: "ALL OF US LABOR IN WEBS

40:16.680 --> 40:19.069
SPUN LONG BEFORE WE WERE BORN."

40:19.110 --> 40:21.476
WILLIAM FAULKN ER.

40:24.950 --> 40:28.147
NOT BAD FOR THE FIRST
TIME STEERING THE SHIP.

40:28.190 --> 40:30.579
PRENTISS WOULD BE PROUD.

40:30.620 --> 40:32.759
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM EMILY?

40:32.790 --> 40:34.929
NO.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.019
I, UH, I TEXTED HER

40:37.060 --> 40:40.188
TO LET HER KNOW WE WERE
ON OUR WAY BACK, BUT...

40:40.230 --> 40:43.939
I'LL BE GLAD
WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER.

40:43.970 --> 40:45.938
YEAH.

41:12.870 --> 41:14.599
HEY.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.494
HOW WAS THE CASE?

41:16.540 --> 41:18.064
WE GOT OUR GUY.

41:18.100 --> 41:21.069
I HEARD YOU DID
A FANTASTIC JOB.

41:21.110 --> 41:24.102
HOW DID IT GO
WITH BARNES?

41:24.140 --> 41:25.903
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

41:25.950 --> 41:28.202
I HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED
FROM ACTIVE DUTY.

41:28.250 --> 41:31.071
I'VE TURNED IN MY BADGE
AND MY GUN.

41:31.120 --> 41:34.214
WHAT--I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

41:34.250 --> 41:36.218
FOR HOW LONG?

41:36.260 --> 41:37.955
INDEFINITELY.

41:37.990 --> 41:40.288
JJ WILL CONTINUE

41:45.970 --> 41:48.097
ARE WE UNDER
INVESTIGATION?

41:48.130 --> 41:51.805
YES, WE ARE
UNDER INVESTIGATION.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.570
AND I TRIED,
BUT WITH THE SUSPENSION,

41:54.610 --> 41:56.578
I CAN'T PROTECT YOU.
