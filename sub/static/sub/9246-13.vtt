[instrumental music]

00:03.525 --> 00:04.830
So, you kids must be getting

00:04.917 --> 00:06.484
pretty excited
about the big day.

00:06.571 --> 00:10.097
Yeah, Molly and I both
love Super Bowl Sunday.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.446
Wedding. Wedding.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.796
Oh.

00:13.883 --> 00:16.538
Well, everything's all
squared away at St. Bart's.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.322
And if you slip
the organist 15 bucks

00:18.409 --> 00:20.020
she'll play anything you want.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.196
Now, I warn you,
she's 85 and incontinent

00:22.283 --> 00:25.547
so those low notes ain't
always coming from the organ.

00:26.765 --> 00:28.767
Okay, well, good to know.

00:28.854 --> 00:31.509
Sounds like we'll be
using the ceiling fans.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.468
Oh, and at some point
you'll have to sit down

00:33.555 --> 00:34.469
with Father Tim.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.166
It's a formality, really.

00:36.253 --> 00:37.254
He just has to confirm

00:37.341 --> 00:38.560
you're a boy and you're a girl

00:38.647 --> 00:41.345
and both planning
on staying that way.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.565
Well, what if I was both?
Then I wouldn't need Mike.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.175
[both chuckling]

00:47.090 --> 00:49.701
Make sure she doesn't crack wise
in front of the good Father.

00:49.788 --> 00:52.791
He drinks, he's got a temper,
and he's not a big fan of women.

00:54.271 --> 00:55.838
So, where you
having the reception?

00:55.925 --> 00:57.883
We found this place,
it's actually pretty nice

00:57.970 --> 00:59.624
and it's walking distance
from the church.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.887
Great, so I gotta traipse
around the dirty streets

01:01.974 --> 01:04.977
of Chicago wearing high heels
and a taffeta gown?

01:05.065 --> 01:08.198
I'm sorry.
You're wearing a taffeta gown?

01:08.285 --> 01:10.026
Not if I got to hoof it
to the reception.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.593
Wind comes along,
catches my skirt

01:11.680 --> 01:13.551
everybody gets a freebie.

01:16.989 --> 01:18.774
Well, that's a visual.

01:20.471 --> 01:22.125
I don't know why you don't
have the reception

01:22.212 --> 01:23.257
in the church basement.

01:23.344 --> 01:24.736
It's clean, it's free.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.608
You lay down a couple
of sheets of plywood

01:26.695 --> 01:28.697
you got a dance floor.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.960
Well, that certainly
sounds festive

01:31.047 --> 01:33.397
in a hoedown-y kind of way

01:33.484 --> 01:35.704
but Mike and I were thinking

01:35.791 --> 01:38.054
you know,
uh...a little help?

01:38.141 --> 01:40.839
We don't wanna do it
in a basement, ma.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.232
Fine, blow your money.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.842
Your kids can go
to community college

01:43.929 --> 01:45.757
and have crooked teeth.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.977
Now, about the seating
arrangements.

01:48.064 --> 01:50.675
I'm at the head table
next to my boy, right?

01:50.762 --> 01:53.200
Actually, we were thinking
that Mike and I would sit

01:53.287 --> 01:54.723
at a sweetheart table
and everybody else

01:54.810 --> 01:56.899
would be seated around us.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.771
Not much space
in your spotlight, is there?

02:01.338 --> 02:03.384
So, where's that put me,
near to the kitchen door

02:03.471 --> 02:04.950
with one of your
humpback uncles?

02:06.648 --> 02:09.433
Well, we thought by
eliminating the head table

02:09.520 --> 02:10.652
things would be
a little less awkward

02:10.739 --> 02:13.002
between you and Mike's dad.

02:13.089 --> 02:15.091
Come again?

02:15.178 --> 02:16.832
Abort. Abort.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.879
I thought you two already
talked about this.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.969
You invited your deadbeat dad
and his hell-bound whore

02:24.056 --> 02:26.624
to come to our wedding?

02:29.497 --> 02:33.022
Well, it's still kinda
up in the air with the whore.

02:34.023 --> 02:36.330
Wait, "our wedding?"

02:36.417 --> 02:38.897
You ungrateful, little Judas.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.117
After all the sacrifices
I've made for you

02:41.204 --> 02:43.815
and you just stab me
in the back.

02:43.902 --> 02:48.168
Enjoy your 30 pieces
of silver, turncoat!

02:49.691 --> 02:52.389
That's great.
This is just perfect.

What were you thinking?!

03:19.242 --> 03:21.026
Everything was going so well
and you had to bring up

03:21.113 --> 03:22.332
my dad coming to the wedding?

03:22.419 --> 03:24.508
You told me
she was fine with it!

03:24.595 --> 03:28.338
She was, because she
didn't know about it!

03:28.425 --> 03:29.992
Well, don't blame me
because you're afraid

03:30.079 --> 03:31.385
to talk to your own mother.

That's not the point.
She's your mom.

You should be able to be honest
and open with her.

03:40.089 --> 03:44.398
Are you hearing yourself?

03:44.485 --> 03:46.748
Why is there a cop car
in front of my house?

03:46.835 --> 03:49.272
You got me, there's no way
my mom could've bought a rifle

03:49.359 --> 03:50.969
and beat us here.

I can fill the trunk of your car

and Mexican Rolexes.

Uh, Officer Michael Biggs.
What's the problem, fellas?

04:12.904 --> 04:14.210
She was driving erratically

04:14.297 --> 04:15.690
and we followed her
to this location

04:15.777 --> 04:18.736
where she proceeded to park
her car on the sidewalk.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.260
But in front of my own house.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.609
That's supposed to be
home base

04:21.696 --> 04:24.002
which means
I'm olly olly oxen free.

04:25.743 --> 04:28.006
She's also got 12
outstanding parking tickets

04:28.093 --> 04:30.487
and she's been driving
on a suspended license.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.663
We have to impound the vehicle
and take her to the station.

from having you in the house

So, what is the deal?
Does she have to go to court?

05:54.136 --> 05:56.617

until she pays the fines

05:56.704 --> 05:58.140
and gets her license reinstated.

pull any strings?

the night in jail.

was skunk air-freshener.
