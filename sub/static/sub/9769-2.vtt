WEBVTT

00:09.444 --> 00:10.511
Aw...

00:11.467 --> 00:12.302
Ooh.

00:19.318 --> 00:20.888
Disgusting...

00:21.027 --> 00:22.020
or wonderful?

00:26.435 --> 00:27.011
Hey.

00:27.130 --> 00:28.612
Morning, roomie.

00:28.878 --> 00:31.532
So... tell me about last night.

00:31.949 --> 00:32.783
What about it?

00:32.907 --> 00:35.077
I heard a girl's voice coming from your bedroom.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.955
Oh. Uh... yeah, I don't really want to talk aut that.

00:38.041 --> 00:39.980
- Come on, stud.
- Shh!

00:40.169 --> 00:41.855
Ooh, is she still here?

00:43.047 --> 00:45.424
Somebody's really taking to the bachelor life.

00:49.267 --> 00:49.982
Yeah.

00:51.498 --> 00:52.928
Good morning, Joey.

00:53.147 --> 00:54.617
You spent the night in his room?

00:54.697 --> 00:56.515
Please tell me she didn't sleep in your bed.

00:56.607 --> 00:58.308
I slept on the floor. Don't worry.

00:58.402 --> 01:01.019
Not everyone wants to kill their daddy and marry their mommy like you.

01:01.121 --> 01:03.146
That was one drawing I did.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.691
What are you doing here?

01:05.983 --> 01:08.439
Well, at 2:00 in the morning, I realized michael didn't have his white noise machine,

01:08.538 --> 01:09.653
so I brought it over.

01:09.719 --> 01:11.989
He can't sleep without his sounds of the jungle.

01:12.143 --> 01:15.200
That's why I dreamt I was being attacked by monkeys.

01:16.856 --> 01:17.703
Wait a minute.

01:17.823 --> 01:19.730
If Joey didn't let you in, how did you get in last night, mom?

01:20.147 --> 01:22.194
- I let myself in.
- You have a key?

01:22.432 --> 01:24.293
Yes, I made one for emergencies.

01:24.598 --> 01:27.546
When you turned down that hit show, it was a very dark time for you.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.964
I thought you might do something drastic.

01:29.151 --> 01:31.508
- I wasn't gonna kill myself.
- Really?

01:31.675 --> 01:32.926
You didn't even think about it?

01:34.348 --> 01:36.555
Mom, maybe you shouldn't have a key.

01:36.712 --> 01:39.653
I mean, the whole reason for this move was so that I could have some independence.

01:39.772 --> 01:43.145
Yeah, and I don't know how comfortable I am with you just coming over whenever you want.

01:43.312 --> 01:45.334
- I mean, what if I have a girl over?
- Yeah, what if I have one?

01:45.414 --> 01:47.441
Will you stop being silly, we're trying to have a conversation.

01:49.660 --> 01:52.988
Fine. If it's such a big deal, you can have the stupid key back.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.701
That was too easy. You have another one.

01:58.510 --> 02:00.454
Good job, Nancy Drew.

02:01.772 --> 02:02.456
Here.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.205
How many more do you have?

02:05.244 --> 02:07.002
We can do this all day.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.724 --> 02:47.668
- Hey, Alex.
- Hey.

02:47.706 --> 02:49.628
Look at you all dressed for work.

02:49.792 --> 02:51.463
You know I played a lawyer once.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.923
"I object."

02:52.978 --> 02:54.216
"No further questions."

02:54.389 --> 02:57.344
"How can this be a jury of his peers when five of the jurors are androids?"

02:59.125 --> 03:02.516
-So, the movie's in the future?
- No, no, this was, like, three years ago.

03:03.872 --> 03:04.726
Oh, my.

03:05.820 --> 03:07.290
Say, I hate to bother you with this,

03:07.349 --> 03:09.833
but my husband's out of town, and normally I would ask him,

03:09.912 --> 03:11.984
but what do you think looks better with this?

03:12.038 --> 03:14.111
Hair down or hair up?

03:14.899 --> 03:15.694
Definitely up.

03:15.823 --> 03:19.533
Yeah, your hair is nice, but I like it better back so that I can see your face.

03:20.284 --> 03:21.159
Oh...

03:21.670 --> 03:22.961
Yeah, I played a husband once, too.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.914
- Okay, thanks. See ya.
- Okay, right.

03:26.947 --> 03:29.459
Oh, my God. Another one of these.

03:29.570 --> 03:30.377
What?

03:30.853 --> 03:32.504
A note from the super.

03:32.582 --> 03:35.132
"No unsanctioned grills allowed.

03:35.251 --> 03:37.259
Please remove your grill from the patio."

03:37.507 --> 03:39.803
I can't believe this. How am I supposed to make a hamburger?

03:40.179 --> 03:41.805
Well, you could use a frying pan.

03:41.941 --> 03:43.682
Oh, don't.. just don't.

03:45.852 --> 03:47.064
Does everybody get these notes?

03:47.183 --> 03:49.563
Yeah, yeah, the super's kind of a hard-ass.

03:49.839 --> 03:51.945
- Oh. Do you get a lot of notes?
- Me? No.

03:52.005 --> 03:54.693
But I don't do anything wrong. I'm kind of a good girl.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.946
I wonder if Mr. Alex would tell me the same thing.

04:00.691 --> 04:03.243
Maybe I wait a few days before making sex jokes with you.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.330
- Yeah. And maybe don't even do it then.
- Good.

04:10.989 --> 04:13.962
Gina... I haven't seen you in minutes.

04:15.536 --> 04:18.091
Don't worry, I'm just about to leave. I'm not gonna bother you.

04:18.435 --> 04:20.886
Michael! Your snack is ready!

04:21.565 --> 04:24.097
In a minute! I'm in the middle of something!

04:24.263 --> 04:26.266
Well, hurry up, I gotta get going!

04:26.327 --> 04:28.435
I'm so glad I moved out here!

04:33.342 --> 04:35.651
Here's your snack, baby. I gotta get back to the salon.

04:36.026 --> 04:39.321
Oh, an hour and a half under the hair dryer. I hope someone's not dead.

04:42.603 --> 04:45.452
Can you believe her? She's here all the time.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.579
Yeah, well, she loves you.

04:47.641 --> 04:49.706
Yeah, but it doesn't even feel like I moved out.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.501
I thought living with you, we'd have this crazy single life.

04:52.602 --> 04:56.630
You know, the two of us out, meeting girls. I mean, I know how you are with women.

04:56.780 --> 04:57.548
You do ?

04:58.513 --> 05:00.361
Sure, it's the first memory I have of you.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.845
We came to New York for this big family party.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.263
All the girl cousins flock to you.

05:04.401 --> 05:06.181
I know nothing would have happened with them.

05:06.259 --> 05:08.267
No, not even once, before I knew that was wrong.

05:11.341 --> 05:12.980
I guess I just thought if I lived with you,

05:13.105 --> 05:14.857
then I'd have a chance to learn a few things.

05:15.467 --> 05:17.355
- Aw...
- What?

05:17.673 --> 05:19.987
That's really sweet. You want to learn stuff from your uncle.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.572
Well,  yeah.

05:21.807 --> 05:23.448
That's new for me, you know.

05:23.615 --> 05:24.985
I've never been the one to teach someone something.

05:25.065 --> 05:26.336
I was always the one who...

05:28.056 --> 05:29.872
No, never learned anything either.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.168
-  So, are you up to it?
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.462
You came to the right guy. I have so much knowledge to give.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.716
You don't really have a dad around and I don't have any sons.

05:43.057 --> 05:45.345
So, we can go to a bar tomorrow night.

05:45.514 --> 05:47.764
Cool. I've never done that before.

05:47.865 --> 05:49.043
You'll  have a blast.

05:49.123 --> 05:51.393
I remember the first time I went out to a bar and hit on girls.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.604
- Were you my age?
- Close to it.

05:53.696 --> 05:55.522
- What, like 18?
- 11.

06:03.620 --> 06:05.490
Oh, I feel so lonely.

06:07.332 --> 06:08.869
Well, hello, handsome.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.335
- Joey.
- Hey, how was school?

06:16.752 --> 06:19.338
Great. How was... what you do?

06:21.959 --> 06:24.343
For your information, I had a really big audition today.

06:24.463 --> 06:25.969
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?

06:26.428 --> 06:27.888
I don't know. I got lost.

06:29.510 --> 06:31.040
You got some more notes from the super.

06:32.053 --> 06:34.102
Man, this guy will not leave me alone.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.439
"Wet towels cannot be left in the courtyard."

06:37.552 --> 06:38.942
Yeah, they can, I did it.

06:40.194 --> 06:43.237
"Underwear is not appropriate hot tub attire."

06:43.539 --> 06:44.334
Why not?

06:44.433 --> 06:46.782
Uh, maybe because when it's wet, it's see-through.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.160
Hey, how 'bout that?

06:52.664 --> 06:53.896
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:54.096 --> 06:55.999
Hey, I know that you were upset about your grill,

06:56.124 --> 06:58.323
so I made you a list of places around that make good burgers,

06:58.442 --> 07:00.337
and also a couple of my favorite restaurants.

07:00.382 --> 07:01.797
And there's your pee-pee.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.519
This is great. Hey, thanks for doing this.

07:08.599 --> 07:10.327
Say, Alex, have you met my nephew, Michael?

07:10.467 --> 07:11.976
Not officially, no.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.350
It's nice to meet you, Michael.

07:13.454 --> 07:15.727
Golly. Yeah. Uh, hi. Wow.

07:17.941 --> 07:19.815
That's... clammy.

07:23.887 --> 07:26.154
Why don't save some of that magic for tonight?

07:29.470 --> 07:30.701
You know know any of these places?

07:31.359 --> 07:32.703
Um...

07:33.805 --> 07:35.789
- This is weird.
- What?

07:36.801 --> 07:40.290
The handwriting on this list looks a lot like the handwriting on the notes from the super.

07:40.409 --> 07:42.005
Check it out. It's the same.

07:42.047 --> 07:43.504
You know what that means?

07:43.764 --> 07:46.258
Alex and the super had the same handwriting teacher!

07:48.760 --> 07:50.304
Uh, or...

07:50.812 --> 07:52.598
Uh... Alex is the super.

07:52.699 --> 07:56.682
- Or... Alex and the super have a secret...
- No, no, you had it.

07:56.801 --> 07:57.616
Right.

07:58.967 --> 08:00.397
Wait a second. Wait a second.

08:00.767 --> 08:04.125
If Alex is the super, that means she lied to me.

08:04.581 --> 08:05.694
That sucks.

08:08.681 --> 08:10.199
The same handwriting teacher.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.954
"Uh, golly. Hi. Gee. Wow."

08:23.465 --> 08:24.630
Okay.

08:24.856 --> 08:26.965
God, it took you forever to get ready.

08:27.820 --> 08:28.842
Just like an hour and a half.

08:29.021 --> 08:30.802
Usually takes Mom, like, two hours.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.471
That is because she is a woman.

08:33.086 --> 08:34.765
Something which you are not.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.768
Well, you look really nice.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.102
I am also not a woman. We don't do that.

08:42.235 --> 08:44.191
But thanks ! Okay, come on, let's go.

08:44.319 --> 08:46.151
Great, let me just make sure I've got everything.

08:46.445 --> 08:48.862
I've got some money, I got my fake ID...

08:48.928 --> 08:50.697
- Ah...
- Yeah, these are cool.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.014
Some guys at Cal Tech made these.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.827
They're impossible to tell apart from the real thing.

08:53.926 --> 08:56.203
But I did have a little fun with it. Check out the name.

08:56.959 --> 08:59.206
-Nils Bohr?
- The famous physicist.

08:59.266 --> 09:01.250
- He developed the...
- No, thanks. Nope.

09:02.796 --> 09:04.962
Look, uh, Michael, as your teacher,

09:05.084 --> 09:08.048
I feel like we should talk a little bit about your rap.

09:08.337 --> 09:11.927
Now we have to take your greatest weakness,

09:12.132 --> 09:13.428
your intelligence,

09:13.946 --> 09:15.495
and turn that into a strength.

09:15.595 --> 09:18.141
Now, what kind of stuff are you smart about?

09:18.631 --> 09:20.975
- Uh, I know physics.
- No. Next.

09:21.055 --> 09:23.220
- Uh, I enjoy cubing.
- What's cubing?

09:23.292 --> 09:26.153
That's when people share different strategies to solve Rubik's cubes.

09:26.272 --> 09:26.670
Next.

09:27.943 --> 09:30.202
- Also speed cubing...
- Next.

09:31.692 --> 09:33.991
Uh, I'm pretty knowledgeable about astronomy.

09:35.123 --> 09:37.160
- That's, like, stars?
- Right.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.745
Yeah, okay. That could work.

09:38.821 --> 09:41.582
Yeah, yeah, okay.  You take a girl outside,

09:41.832 --> 09:44.562
you show her the stars, very romantic.

09:44.642 --> 09:48.547
Maybe it getrs a little chilly, you slip your arm around her.

09:48.706 --> 09:51.383
You're starting to feel like another teacher I had.

09:51.446 --> 09:52.968
- He got fired.
- All right.

09:54.653 --> 09:55.825
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

09:55.865 --> 09:56.819
- Let's go.
- All right.

09:57.608 --> 09:59.099
Hey, guys, it's me.

09:59.743 --> 10:02.352
What are we going to do? She's going to want to come with us.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.479
Pretend we're not here.

10:05.134 --> 10:05.849
Hey.

10:08.078 --> 10:09.667
Don't make me use my key.

10:13.780 --> 10:14.907
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:15.007 --> 10:17.826
Look at you two all dressed up.

10:18.463 --> 10:20.621
- Where are we going?
- Uh... nowhere.

10:20.695 --> 10:23.238
- Nowhere. We're just hanging out.
- Just a quiet night at home, Ma.

10:23.417 --> 10:24.828
Well, I know you're going out, Michael.

10:24.907 --> 10:26.251
You got your shoulder pads on.

10:29.207 --> 10:31.006
You're not a woman from the '80s.

10:33.484 --> 10:35.470
So, what's going on?

10:35.616 --> 10:38.222
Well, we were going to go to this bar down the street.

10:38.743 --> 10:40.474
Sounds like fun. I'm in.

10:40.612 --> 10:44.937
Uh... yeah, I don't know I'm not sure you should come, Mom.

10:45.075 --> 10:47.689
We were maybe thinking of, you know...

10:47.732 --> 10:49.066
talking to some girls.

10:49.238 --> 10:50.589
Then you definitely want me there.

10:50.689 --> 10:52.159
I happen to be a great wing man.

10:52.338 --> 10:54.086
Remember when I hooked you up with Cousin Marie?

10:54.185 --> 10:54.960
Yeah, thanks a lot.

10:55.049 --> 10:57.074
You know how many Hail Marys I had to say for that?

11:00.927 --> 11:02.337
Come on, let's go.

11:02.516 --> 11:04.957
This is gonna be fun, the three of us out together.

11:05.035 --> 11:08.710
You know, I really think it might be better for the two of us to do this alone.

11:11.322 --> 11:12.038
Oh.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.450
Okay. I understand.

11:14.668 --> 11:17.089
No, well, just for tonight. We can all do something tomorrow.

11:17.169 --> 11:18.122
Yeah.

11:19.056 --> 11:20.864
No, that's fine, really.

11:20.944 --> 11:23.069
I  mean, if you want it to be just the two of you,

11:23.149 --> 11:24.182
then I think you should do that.

11:24.321 --> 11:25.136
Mom...

11:30.557 --> 11:31.942
I feel terrible.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.527
I know, I know.

11:33.630 --> 11:35.946
You know, I forget how sensitive she can be.

11:42.045 --> 11:43.495
And classy.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.466
All right, great. I'll give you a call.

11:58.679 --> 12:02.055
- And that is how it's done.
- Wow.

12:02.531 --> 12:04.391
You got her number. That girl was gorgeous

12:04.683 --> 12:06.685
She lives in Long Beach. Where's that?

12:06.806 --> 12:08.718
Uh, you take the 10 to the 4, 5, 7, 10

12:08.797 --> 12:10.731
Sorry, Betty, it's not to be.

12:12.015 --> 12:14.610
So how do the girls from L.A. compare to the girls from New York?

12:14.776 --> 12:17.112
Well, it's a little early and I don't want to jinx it, but...

12:17.144 --> 12:18.322
they may be trashier.

12:20.062 --> 12:21.575
All right, first thing you want to do

12:21.783 --> 12:23.211
is find someone you're attracted to, right?

12:23.250 --> 12:24.453
You see anyone you like ?

12:25.200 --> 12:27.289
The lady bartender is certainly attractive.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.082
Oh, good eye. Good eye.

12:29.145 --> 12:29.900
No chance.

12:31.163 --> 12:33.308
No. Bartenders get hit on constantly,

12:33.407 --> 12:35.172
so there's a very high level of difficulty.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.862
You might want to start with that sorority girl over there

12:37.922 --> 12:39.927
whose friends are carrying her to the bathroom.

12:41.281 --> 12:43.972
Ah, I don't think so. She doesn't look very smart.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.267
Oh, no. Maybe you won't co-author a book together.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.067
That girl.

12:50.663 --> 12:52.481
She looks, uh, interesting.

12:52.748 --> 12:54.608
Great, okay. Go talk to her.

12:55.692 --> 12:56.860
All right, here we go.

12:58.329 --> 12:59.620
You put them back in ?

12:59.700 --> 13:01.949
Maybe someone here wants a woman from the '80s.

13:03.813 --> 13:06.515
Oh, sorry, we got an anonymous call that you're underage.

13:06.555 --> 13:08.025
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

13:08.105 --> 13:09.237
You got a call about me?

13:09.317 --> 13:11.204
Well, the woman said to look for the handsome genius

13:11.266 --> 13:13.961
accompanied by the Tony Danza-esq older gentleman.

13:16.655 --> 13:18.403
- Gina.
- I can't believe this.

13:18.523 --> 13:20.072
Come on, let's go.

13:20.152 --> 13:21.510
I was just about to score.

13:23.824 --> 13:25.764
Hey, you really think I look like Tony Danza?

13:26.566 --> 13:28.600
Hey, good enough. Come on.

13:37.622 --> 13:40.988
Hey, guys! Are all the girls you picked up coming separately?

13:41.505 --> 13:42.990
I can't believe you.

13:43.319 --> 13:45.242
You called the bar? Why?

13:45.321 --> 13:47.307
Why? Because you shouldn't have been there.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.354
I never drank alcohol before I was 21.

13:53.370 --> 13:54.303
She's right.

13:54.919 --> 13:57.542
I just, I, uh, uh, I can't...

13:58.205 --> 13:58.701
Never mind.

13:58.761 --> 14:01.463
No, no, no, no, Michael. You're upset. You tell your mother how you feel.

14:01.582 --> 14:04.503
It's just... Okay. I wanted some time away from you,

14:04.641 --> 14:06.221
and I don't think that's too much to ask.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.997
You ruined my night, Mom, and Joey's, and that's selfish.

14:10.056 --> 14:11.924
Good, good. You're getting it out. What else? What else?

14:12.043 --> 14:14.313
I hate that you made me take flute lessons.

14:16.187 --> 14:17.856
We're going a little wide now.

14:17.955 --> 14:19.151
Let's bring it back.

14:20.121 --> 14:22.779
I just, I can't believe you couldn't give me one night on my own.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.691
Look, I'm sorry,

14:27.830 --> 14:29.077
but you have to understand,

14:29.369 --> 14:31.796
you abandoning me is my worst nightmare.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.874
Then you haven't had my monkey dream.

14:39.244 --> 14:42.462
I was afraid when you moved out you wouldn't want me to be a part of your life anymore.

14:42.542 --> 14:45.244
And it'd just be the two of you going out, having fun without me.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.637
And now that's what's happening.

14:46.725 --> 14:48.222
Hey, Gina. Come on, now.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.224
Well,  I just don't understand why I can't come, too.

14:50.476 --> 14:51.767
Aren't I a fun mom?

14:51.946 --> 14:54.986
Didn't I buy a case of beer for you and your friends on your 18th birthday, huh?

14:55.085 --> 14:56.852
Yeah. Then you drank it yourself.

14:58.123 --> 15:00.317
And heckled us while we played Trivial Pursuit.

15:01.929 --> 15:04.571
Come on. Just give me a chance.

15:04.810 --> 15:07.574
Let's try it one night. It-it'll be an experiment.

15:07.634 --> 15:09.641
Like that thing you put in the fridge that Joey ate.

15:09.820 --> 15:10.911
Delicious.

15:13.153 --> 15:14.524
Okay, I guess we can try it.

15:14.703 --> 15:16.333
Plus, I can help you with the women.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.127
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay?

15:19.164 --> 15:20.714
I'm actually handling that, all right?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.422
I'm kind of his teacher in that area.

15:23.217 --> 15:25.133
Oh, that must be a pretty involved course.

15:25.371 --> 15:28.720
How you doing? How you doing? How you doing?

15:34.876 --> 15:36.854
Well, it worked on every one of your friends.

15:48.620 --> 15:50.367
-Hey.
- Hey.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.453
I, uh, got another note from the super.

15:53.634 --> 15:54.955
What an idiot.

15:55.131 --> 15:57.416
Spelled "unacceptable" with two Cs.

15:59.235 --> 16:01.461
That's how you spell "unacceptable."

16:01.514 --> 16:03.255
Interesting that you'd know that.

16:05.421 --> 16:07.176
So, how are you? Doing well?

16:07.455 --> 16:08.468
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:08.506 --> 16:11.305
Really? Just fine? You're not great or, say... super?

16:13.278 --> 16:15.663
- All right, Joey, what's up?
- I'll tell you what's up.

16:15.702 --> 16:18.027
Your game is over, okay? You can't fool me.

16:18.106 --> 16:20.439
I know you're the super. Or his handwriting teacher.

16:23.444 --> 16:25.736
The super? Where did you even get that?

16:25.808 --> 16:27.321
Okay, enough! If...

16:27.397 --> 16:29.698
If you don't admit you're the super right now, I'm gonna...

16:30.973 --> 16:32.721
I'm gonna break this chair!

16:32.761 --> 16:34.132
Okay, all right, fine. I'm the super.

16:34.211 --> 16:34.986
- Ah-hah!
- Oh!

16:36.829 --> 16:38.874
I'm really worked up right now.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.669
Well, now you know. It's out in the open.

16:42.734 --> 16:44.171
So why did you lie in the first place?!

16:44.296 --> 16:46.340
I didn't lie. You never asked me directly,

16:46.507 --> 16:48.175
and I just didn't volunteer the information.

16:48.254 --> 16:50.697
okay, the lawyer logic isn't gonna work with me, all right?

16:50.697 --> 16:52.429
Or any other kind of logic, for that matter.

16:55.076 --> 16:57.559
Look, I-I didn't tell you I was the super

16:57.643 --> 16:59.520
because I thought we were getting along. Okay?

16:59.640 --> 17:01.647
Well, it felt good because everybody

17:01.730 --> 17:03.524
in this building hates me and my stupid notes.

17:05.804 --> 17:07.319
They... They call me the notesy.

17:11.185 --> 17:12.574
It's not funny.

17:13.294 --> 17:15.743
And the crazy thing is, it's not even my job.

17:15.953 --> 17:16.869
It's my husband's job,

17:17.037 --> 17:18.579
but he's away a lot so I have to do it,

17:18.704 --> 17:20.540
and if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it well,

17:20.833 --> 17:23.836
so I guess you're just gonna have to go ahead and hate me like everybody else!

17:25.797 --> 17:26.839
Hey.

17:28.991 --> 17:30.384
I don't hate you.

17:31.944 --> 17:33.053
You don't?

17:33.914 --> 17:35.180
You should.

17:36.049 --> 17:38.433
I-I mean, I leave these annoying notes

17:38.546 --> 17:40.352
and I-I made you take away your grill.

17:40.533 --> 17:41.603
Yeah, but...

17:43.889 --> 17:45.858
Look, I don't know many people out here.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.652
Okay? I mean, I got my family, but they're kinda nuts.

17:50.058 --> 17:52.406
Okay? I could use someone normal,

17:52.781 --> 17:54.449
and you show a lot of promise.

17:56.050 --> 17:57.119
Really?

17:57.817 --> 17:59.288
That's so nice.

18:00.132 --> 18:02.499
I don't know what to say. I think I'm gonna cry.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.960
You have got yourself some mood swings.

18:08.385 --> 18:09.798
So, uh...

18:09.897 --> 18:10.966
we're good?

18:11.410 --> 18:12.843
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

18:15.543 --> 18:17.470
You want to give me another note, don't you?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.057
It's the last one, I promise.

18:22.005 --> 18:24.021
But I didn't... Oh, yes, I did. Yeah.

18:30.963 --> 18:33.697
This is gonna be great, Micheal. There are lots of cute girls here.

18:34.412 --> 18:36.617
Ooh, except for her. What a tramp.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.327
That's a mirror, Gina.

18:40.154 --> 18:41.747
I'm not talking about me.

18:44.385 --> 18:46.376
All right, Michael, first thing we gotta do

18:46.482 --> 18:48.045
is  pick out some good prospects.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.463
Now, you're gonna want to play the numbers.

18:49.671 --> 18:50.415
What do you mean?

18:50.474 --> 18:54.635
Well, it's important to choose someone at the same level of hotness as yourself.

18:54.988 --> 18:58.597
You could go two points either way, but I-I wouldn't do much more than that.

18:58.699 --> 19:01.433
For example-- I'm a nine. Okay?

19:02.351 --> 19:08.482
So, I can hit on a seven or a hypothetical 11. Okay?

19:08.521 --> 19:12.069
Another option for me is a four and a five. Okay?

19:13.028 --> 19:14.530
Three threes.

19:14.676 --> 19:18.408
And... and I wouldn't this: nine ones.

19:19.645 --> 19:21.787
Okay, so, what number am I?

19:23.241 --> 19:24.540
- Six.
- Six.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.876
Wow. Honest. Okay.

19:27.986 --> 19:28.682
Okay. All right.

19:28.761 --> 19:31.088
Why don't you start with that seven right over there? She looks nice.

19:31.246 --> 19:33.273
You can't just send him out. He doesn't even know what to say.

19:33.352 --> 19:34.441
No, no, no, we covered that.

19:34.523 --> 19:36.134
Remember, Michael? Talk about the stars.

19:36.226 --> 19:38.312
Oh, honey, if you're going to talk about the stars,

19:38.371 --> 19:40.013
I'm gonna have to downgrade you to a four.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.142
- You got a better idea?
- Yes, I do.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.978
Does this place have a mechanical bull?

19:46.258 --> 19:48.085
Women really like to see how a man moves.

19:48.185 --> 19:50.767
- All like...
- Mom.
- Sit down.

19:51.709 --> 19:53.485
All right, forget the stars, all right?

19:53.652 --> 19:55.320
On to Plan B-- the accidental bump.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.635
Oh, sorry, I... Oh, hi.

20:00.486 --> 20:01.618
Don't listen to him.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.705
You know, I think it'll be easier if you sit here and I bring you girls.

20:04.982 --> 20:06.498
What do you like? Big chest?

20:07.666 --> 20:10.210
You know, I think I'm just gonna go up to the girl and start talking.

20:10.541 --> 20:12.523
Okay, just... make sure you're nice to her.

20:12.562 --> 20:13.814
Yeah, but not too nice.

20:13.953 --> 20:16.133
- Compliment her.
- Ignore her.

20:16.270 --> 20:18.385
- Compliment her, then ignore her.
- Yeah.

20:19.766 --> 20:20.799
Okay...

20:20.859 --> 20:23.515
- Make sure you ask her name.
- And then call her a different name.

20:24.819 --> 20:27.144
- And make eye contact.
- Yeah, but don't stare at her.

20:27.186 --> 20:30.063
- Want to seem interested.
- But completely bored.

20:31.220 --> 20:33.584
- Just be yourself.
- No, no! Pretend to be somebody else.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.778
Okay. All right. I think I'd like you to leave.

20:37.021 --> 20:38.197
- What?
- Why?

20:38.232 --> 20:40.991
It's just a lot of advice. It's putting a lot of pressure on me

20:41.116 --> 20:43.035
and I think I'll just do better if I'm by myself.

20:44.469 --> 20:45.704
Oh.. Okay.

20:46.575 --> 20:47.623
Wow.

20:48.379 --> 20:50.292
I guess we'd better go.

20:52.628 --> 20:54.463
Damn it, that is me.

21:02.091 --> 21:03.889
I can't believe Michael's still not home yet.

21:04.394 --> 21:05.891
I know, it's taking a while.

21:05.992 --> 21:07.392
Do you think that means he scored?

21:07.809 --> 21:09.019
No.

21:12.372 --> 21:15.901
I really wanted to help him with this stuff, but it was hard.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.070
Can I tell you a secret?

21:19.338 --> 21:20.489
He's weird.

21:21.658 --> 21:22.950
Can I tell you a secret?

21:23.041 --> 21:23.909
I know.

21:25.375 --> 21:26.829
He's just so different from us.

21:26.888 --> 21:29.873
I mean, can you imagine having trouble with the opposite sex?

21:30.022 --> 21:32.960
The only thing that ever slowed me down was that little bastard.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.714
And he's, he's so... smart.

21:38.073 --> 21:39.466
Where's he get that from?

21:39.519 --> 21:40.214
I don't know.

21:40.313 --> 21:43.679
I mean, it's like some alien sent from another planet to make me feel stupid.

21:43.849 --> 21:46.056
Well, I'm here now, okay?

21:46.462 --> 21:49.017
So the dummies outnumber the aliens.

21:51.430 --> 21:52.562
Just...

21:52.999 --> 21:55.274
I feel bad, you know? I'm his uncle.

21:55.363 --> 21:56.942
I want to help him with something.

21:58.143 --> 22:00.612
If I can't help him with girls, I don't know what else I got.

22:01.074 --> 22:03.418
Well, you are helping him-- he's out on a Saturday night.

22:03.537 --> 22:05.784
Normally he'd be at the library studying.

22:06.356 --> 22:09.496
If he left the bar and went to the library, I am going to kill him.

22:11.421 --> 22:13.500
How'd it go?

22:14.467 --> 22:15.836
I got a phone number...

22:16.077 --> 22:17.629
from a solid five.

22:20.365 --> 22:22.092
Good for you.All right.

22:23.659 --> 22:25.429
So, you gonna call her?

22:25.700 --> 22:26.805
I think so.

22:26.895 --> 22:29.057
- Call her now.
- No, no, no. Wait three days.

22:29.761 --> 22:31.433
No, you want her to know you like her.

22:31.532 --> 22:32.406
No, play hard to get.

22:32.665 --> 22:35.814
- Take her to dinner and a movie.
- Bring her a slice and some porn.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.443
Joey, that's disgusting.
