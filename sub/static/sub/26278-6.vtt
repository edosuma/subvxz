00:01.012 --> 00:02.981
I don't know what it
sounded like, McNab,

00:02.987 --> 00:04.626
I just said that I
heard a strange noise.

00:04.650 --> 00:06.460
Is that precise enough for you?

00:07.689 --> 00:10.356
No, I suppose you needn't send someone.

00:10.372 --> 00:11.996
I'll just have a look myself.

00:12.885 --> 00:14.446
As usual.

00:21.024 --> 00:22.297
Huh...

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:32.845 --> 00:34.214
Who's there?

00:34.898 --> 00:36.259
Answer me!

00:37.845 --> 00:39.522
Evening, Officer.

00:39.991 --> 00:41.858
What are you doing out at this hour?

00:42.742 --> 00:44.403
Drinking.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.729
Go home to your beds.

00:46.749 --> 00:48.924
I just need to find one that'll have me.

00:48.932 --> 00:50.873
Station House Four cells
will be happy to have you

00:50.885 --> 00:53.565
- if you don't get a move on.
- All right, all right...

00:54.296 --> 00:56.140
Humourless git.

01:03.132 --> 01:04.676
Show yourself!

01:11.363 --> 01:13.150
What the devil...

02:13.468 --> 02:14.983
_

02:16.890 --> 02:18.004
Amazing.

02:18.009 --> 02:20.860
What's so amazing about some
bloody rocks falling from the sky?

02:20.918 --> 02:24.182
It's a true celestial
event. It's fascinating.

02:24.357 --> 02:25.940
It's nothing but a nuisance.

02:26.244 --> 02:28.273
We must have received
about a hundred calls

02:28.286 --> 02:30.295
from people who thought the
world was coming to an end.

02:30.319 --> 02:33.554
What's amazing is not what they're
made of, but where they're from.

02:33.567 --> 02:36.389
Yes, they come... they come from
another planet, sir! Isn't that right?

02:36.468 --> 02:40.563
A bit like Halley's comet except
these ones have crashed to the ground.

02:40.567 --> 02:44.065
Well... It's not exactly
like Halley's Comet, George.

02:44.090 --> 02:46.753
Halley's comet has a
distinct orbital path.

02:46.840 --> 02:49.946
- Meteors are a completely different thing.
- Crabtree!

02:50.147 --> 02:51.553
Listen to these two.

02:51.599 --> 02:55.280
There are all sorts of rocks
and debris out in space.

02:55.297 --> 02:58.748
Occasionally, they get trapped
in earth's gravitational pull

02:58.773 --> 03:00.351
and begin a plunge downward.

03:00.517 --> 03:02.346
Sir, how was nobody killed?

03:02.471 --> 03:05.296
Well, the speed at which they
enter the earth's atmosphere

03:05.317 --> 03:08.872
- causes them to burn up to nothing.
- Surely no, sir.

03:08.950 --> 03:10.691
You mean to tell me that rocks burn?

03:11.843 --> 03:13.655
Let me explain.

03:13.780 --> 03:16.080
Congratulations, Crabtree.
Now look what you've done.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.901
As you know, the earth is
surrounded by an atmosphere

03:18.922 --> 03:21.694
comprised of gases that
provide friction against

03:21.719 --> 03:23.799
any object that moves through it.

03:23.965 --> 03:26.156
- Thank the Lord.
- Friction creates heat.

03:26.281 --> 03:27.772
Yes?

03:27.994 --> 03:30.814
Yes. Yes.

03:30.939 --> 03:32.999
I'll send my best man
out there immediately.

03:33.024 --> 03:34.409
Thank you. Goodbye.

03:34.944 --> 03:37.098
Crabtree, get out to side road four.

03:37.114 --> 03:39.281
There's a farmer out there
reporting a disturbance.

03:39.343 --> 03:41.497
Sir, does it have anything
to do with the meteors?

03:41.530 --> 03:43.066
I don't bloody know.

03:43.121 --> 03:45.429
Oh, and take Watts with you.

03:46.189 --> 03:48.694
He seems exceptionally idle today.

03:49.407 --> 03:51.592
So then, sir, am I your...

03:51.717 --> 03:53.594
You said you'd send your best man.

03:53.619 --> 03:56.273
It's just something to say,
Crabtree. Get a move on.

03:56.274 --> 03:58.074
Oh, I see! You're trying to determine

03:58.466 --> 04:01.934
- the atmospheric drag coefficient.
- Watts! Come on!

04:01.968 --> 04:03.629
Yes, I thought I would assume

04:03.637 --> 04:05.766
half of the atmospheric
pressure at sea level.

04:05.770 --> 04:07.907
That's a good compromise.

04:08.562 --> 04:11.213
Bloody Hell. I'll leave you two to it.

04:18.753 --> 04:19.990
What's that?

04:20.269 --> 04:21.689
Well, sir, it is a plant.

04:21.743 --> 04:23.910
The particular sort I am not certain.

04:24.085 --> 04:25.880
I know it's a bloody plant, Higgins.

04:25.909 --> 04:27.170
What is it doing in here?

04:27.258 --> 04:29.419
I thought the office could
use some brightening up.

04:29.782 --> 04:30.955
I don't like it.

04:31.032 --> 04:33.690
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Would
you like me to get rid of it?

04:35.585 --> 04:38.832
Just put it somewhere unobtrusive.

04:41.712 --> 04:43.920
What was that telephone
call about last night?

04:43.979 --> 04:46.667
- Pardon me?
- You said you heard a disturbance.

04:47.414 --> 04:50.186
Oh, it was nothing. But
thank you for asking.

04:58.020 --> 05:00.070
Is there anything you would
like me to do today, sir?

05:00.091 --> 05:01.515
I am ready to serve.

05:01.685 --> 05:03.289
I'll tell you if I need anything.

05:03.765 --> 05:05.966
Very good. As I said, I will be ready.

05:06.766 --> 05:08.355
Are you all right, Higgins?

05:08.430 --> 05:11.106
Never better, sir, never better.

05:31.308 --> 05:33.554
What if there are more
than just rocks up there?

05:34.180 --> 05:35.533
What sort of more?

05:36.472 --> 05:37.812
Creatures.

05:38.021 --> 05:41.577
Could you imagine there could be
life up there beyond the stars?

05:41.610 --> 05:43.868
I don't need to imagine.
Just think of it,

05:43.893 --> 05:46.114
all those stars, all those planets.

05:46.143 --> 05:48.013
Who would be arrogant enough to assume

05:48.018 --> 05:51.595
that we are the only life
in all the vastness of space?

05:52.351 --> 05:55.389
- So you believe in space aliens?
- I do indeed.

05:55.631 --> 05:56.984
What do you think they look like?

05:57.230 --> 05:59.226
Because I imagine they're
terrible looking creatures.

05:59.250 --> 06:02.034
With large heads and long fingers.

06:02.122 --> 06:05.110
Or maybe not fingers.
Maybe... maybe suction cups.

06:05.126 --> 06:07.476
Or maybe... maybe they
have no heads at all,

06:07.488 --> 06:09.474
like a squid. That's what they're like.

06:09.898 --> 06:11.166
Or who knows, maybe they're lovely.

06:11.190 --> 06:14.599
Maybe they are elf-like
and friendly. Who could say?

06:14.841 --> 06:16.123
Intelligent?

06:16.562 --> 06:18.408
I fear they may be more cunning.

06:19.839 --> 06:22.802
- How do you think they would regard us?
- That's just the thing.

06:22.831 --> 06:25.574
They... They might think
we're just as terrible.

06:25.699 --> 06:28.742
Which is why we need
to keep our guard up.

06:28.771 --> 06:30.390
- Hmm-mm.
- Woah!

06:32.269 --> 06:35.315
- And this happened last night?
- Just after the meteors.

06:36.308 --> 06:39.047
- What did you hear?
- I thought it was a fight,

06:39.080 --> 06:41.314
but when I came outside
there was no one here.

06:41.393 --> 06:43.000
Just this strange thing.

06:43.542 --> 06:46.632
- What do you think it is?
- I have no idea.

06:47.863 --> 06:50.204
I'm going to bring it
back to the Station House.

06:50.501 --> 06:52.734
Suit yourself. Madam.

07:02.147 --> 07:03.332
Tea, sir?

07:04.321 --> 07:06.813
Thank you very much,
Higgins, that's very kind.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.864
What the devil's going on?

07:10.102 --> 07:11.984
I understood you liked tea, sir.

07:12.151 --> 07:13.353
I do like tea.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.065
Nevermind.

07:15.507 --> 07:18.024
Very good. Would you like
me to go on patrol now?

07:19.164 --> 07:20.734
What have you done wrong, Higgins?

07:20.767 --> 07:22.282
I hope nothing, sir.

07:22.457 --> 07:25.065
I am just ready to take on
the obligations of my job.

07:26.226 --> 07:27.841
Get back to your desk.

07:36.489 --> 07:37.562
Very good.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.753
Very good.

07:48.422 --> 07:49.616
Henry!

07:49.637 --> 07:51.327
Did you see this last night?

07:51.452 --> 07:55.130
- I did not. What is it?
- I'm not sure.

07:55.255 --> 07:57.254
It looks like rubbish. Let
me get rid of it for you.

07:57.271 --> 08:00.268
No, Henry. I want this.

08:01.804 --> 08:03.181
Are you all right?

08:03.494 --> 08:05.181
Everything is perfectly fine.

08:05.398 --> 08:06.913
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

08:23.588 --> 08:25.253
Lucky it didn't hit the house.

08:25.295 --> 08:26.588
When did it happen?

08:27.624 --> 08:29.610
Around two in the
morning. Heard a crash,

08:29.611 --> 08:31.005
came outside.

08:31.235 --> 08:33.076
Just replaced the boards as well.

08:33.105 --> 08:35.606
- Can you see to the bottom?
- I can't.

08:36.190 --> 08:37.775
Must be an awful distance.

08:38.022 --> 08:40.918
- What did you say it was?
- A meteor.

08:41.557 --> 08:44.254
- Can we be expecting more?
- I don't know.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.662
It could have brained me as easy as not.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.912
See if you can find out anything else.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.544
I'm going to visit
the neighbouring farms,

08:50.552 --> 08:52.639
see if there have
been any other reports.

08:53.403 --> 08:55.026
I'll be back presently.

08:56.128 --> 08:58.069
You say it came from outer space?

08:58.194 --> 08:59.552
I did.

09:00.199 --> 09:01.606
Should we be worried?

09:02.687 --> 09:04.127
My God, yes!

09:04.252 --> 09:07.667
Mr. O'Riely, heaven
knows what sort of beasts

09:07.700 --> 09:09.520
inhabit the cosmos!

09:14.135 --> 09:17.232
Wasps nests and many others
of the phylum arthropoda

09:17.245 --> 09:19.023
build their homes out of chewed wood.

09:19.106 --> 09:21.277
And silk secreted from their bodies.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.380
But this is neither of those.

09:25.125 --> 09:26.923
It is organic.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.924
It seems to be some sort of cocoon.

09:37.049 --> 09:40.735
- Yes. But what species?
- I don't know.

09:42.647 --> 09:43.916
Miss Hart,

09:44.250 --> 09:46.950
could you perform a
thorough examination of this?

09:47.234 --> 09:50.678
Let's see if we can try to determine
what material it's composed of.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.052
I'll do what I can.

09:52.293 --> 09:54.042
Do you have any thoughts, Julia?

09:54.088 --> 09:55.432
I do indeed.

09:55.611 --> 09:58.550
My main one being
that this is beyond us.

09:59.338 --> 10:02.407
Hopefully someone at the
University's zoology department

10:02.415 --> 10:04.431
will be able to shed some light.

10:12.121 --> 10:14.049
Looks like it goes on forever.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.210
It can't go on forever.

10:16.237 --> 10:18.804
Right? I mean, that's...
that's impossible.

10:18.813 --> 10:21.284
We would be able to see
China if that was the case.

10:22.198 --> 10:25.303
So you're one of those who
believes the world is round?

10:25.766 --> 10:28.331
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

10:28.371 --> 10:29.677
Wait.

10:44.830 --> 10:47.639
- There's something down there.
- Clearly there is.

10:48.198 --> 10:50.344
And what happens to us if it gets out?

10:50.686 --> 10:52.479
Let's see that it doesn't.

11:17.991 --> 11:19.206
Hmm.

11:48.230 --> 11:49.582
Hello, Miss Hart.

11:49.657 --> 11:52.005
Would you like some tea? I
have some freshly steeped.

11:52.106 --> 11:53.481
Orange Pekoe I believe.

11:53.515 --> 11:55.714
I don't enjoy tea, Constable.

11:55.898 --> 11:57.392
It's very good.

11:58.923 --> 12:00.647
What are you doing?

12:00.748 --> 12:03.626
Trying to figure out what this thing is.

12:03.636 --> 12:05.005
And why are you doing that?

12:05.214 --> 12:08.106
- Well, the Detective asked.
- You shouldn't be doing that.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.690
What are you doing?

12:09.713 --> 12:12.030
What is going to happen is for the best.

12:20.571 --> 12:22.812
- What took you so long?
- I'm sorry, George,

12:22.825 --> 12:24.745
the woods were particularly pleasant.

12:24.766 --> 12:26.779
I may have lingered
longer than I should.

12:27.138 --> 12:28.435
What are you doing?

12:29.257 --> 12:31.582
Trying to keep whatever's
down there from coming out.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.306
There's something down there?

12:33.732 --> 12:35.168
Something alive!

12:35.180 --> 12:36.641
We have to tell the Detective.

12:36.987 --> 12:38.975
And what exactly do you think it is?

12:39.618 --> 12:41.066
I don't know.

12:41.074 --> 12:42.677
But... I fear I may have angered it.

12:42.802 --> 12:45.770
- How?
- I may have struck it with a piece of wood.

12:45.782 --> 12:48.315
Then you're right. We
should tell the Detective.

12:48.365 --> 12:52.259
That is our job and those are the
rules and the rules must be obeyed.

12:53.453 --> 12:56.215
- Well, I agree with that, but...
- But what, George?

12:57.029 --> 12:58.093
Well, I've never...

12:58.118 --> 13:00.360
- quite heard you speak like this.
- Really?

13:00.581 --> 13:03.073
Well, I suppose you
haven't been listening.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.339
Let us go get the Detective.

13:06.516 --> 13:08.248
I'll be along in a moment, George,

13:08.257 --> 13:11.446
I just need to get some
particulars from Mr. O'Riely.

13:14.033 --> 13:15.557
Now, Mr. O'Riely,

13:15.578 --> 13:18.433
I have a few questions for you.

13:18.558 --> 13:21.121
O... okay.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.294
And Professor McPherson at
the University of Toronto

13:25.311 --> 13:26.734
has never seen the likes of it.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.867
Has it done something wrong?

13:29.380 --> 13:31.863
- Well, no.
- Then I don't care.

13:32.744 --> 13:34.509
Then why did you ask me to come in?

13:35.837 --> 13:38.182
I was hoping you'd have
a word with Higgins.

13:38.437 --> 13:39.643
Higgins? Why?

13:39.802 --> 13:42.832
- I'm not sure he's right in the head.
- Really?

13:42.957 --> 13:45.970
- And how is that manifesting itself?
- Look.

13:47.807 --> 13:49.522
He's being very dutiful.

13:49.735 --> 13:51.664
And remarkably pleasant.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.765
And that's a condition
that concerns you?

13:55.528 --> 13:57.879
There's something not
quite right about it.

14:03.982 --> 14:07.029
- Could you estimate how deep the caldera is?
- The what?

14:07.204 --> 14:10.022
The caldera. When a
meteor hits the ground,

14:10.043 --> 14:12.394
the impact depression
is known as a caldera.

14:12.415 --> 14:14.429
Or more commonly as a crater.

14:14.466 --> 14:16.218
Well, see, sir, I know what a crater is.

14:16.224 --> 14:17.914
Why wouldn't you just say that?

14:19.015 --> 14:22.031
I'm sorry, sir, I don't
mean to seem testy. I just...

14:22.234 --> 14:24.739
Something strange is
afoot. I can feel it.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.516
- Good day, Detective. Constable.
- Good day.

14:28.803 --> 14:30.327
You see what I mean?

14:31.298 --> 14:34.829
- See what?
- Sir, people almost never say hello to us.

14:35.512 --> 14:39.024
- I hadn't really noticed.
- Well, I have. Often.

14:39.149 --> 14:41.906
I have often thought a
policeman's lot is a lonely one.

14:43.112 --> 14:44.563
Sir, why this?

14:45.084 --> 14:49.577
- You said you heard noises.
- Yes, that's right. It sounded like...

14:54.023 --> 14:57.383
Oh! I... I can't do it, but
it sounded something like that.

14:57.508 --> 14:59.642
Yes, well, I plan to use
this recording equipment

14:59.658 --> 15:02.073
to get a more accurate representation.

15:02.585 --> 15:05.465
- Detective. Constable.
- Miss Hart.

15:05.501 --> 15:09.153
I bring news. I believe what you
found is the nest of a cecrophia.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.882
Cecrophia! Good Lord!

15:11.908 --> 15:14.194
- That's just a moth, George.
- Oh...

15:14.429 --> 15:16.092
Oh, sir, that makes perfect sense.

15:16.108 --> 15:19.421
A moth from outer space! Its
wings would come in handy.

15:19.431 --> 15:21.356
There's no air in space, George.

15:21.372 --> 15:23.595
I think wings would be of little use.

15:23.907 --> 15:27.559
Don't you think the cocoon is
a bit large for that, Miss Hart?

15:27.684 --> 15:29.552
Perhaps it is a large specimen.

15:29.589 --> 15:31.764
From what I have read
they do vary in size.

15:32.009 --> 15:35.781
Yes, well, I do agree it does
resemble the nest of a cecrophia,

15:35.786 --> 15:37.722
but I just don't think that's it.

15:37.967 --> 15:40.299
- Please keep looking.
- I shall, Detective.

15:40.961 --> 15:42.652
Are you planning a trip?

15:43.137 --> 15:45.339
More like an expedition, Miss Hart.

15:45.407 --> 15:47.677
A very important one at that.

16:04.439 --> 16:06.010
Henry!

16:06.939 --> 16:09.203
Thank you for coming
in. Please, have a seat.

16:13.574 --> 16:17.055
- So... How are you?
- I'm very good.

16:18.176 --> 16:20.837
- So everything is going well?
- Things could not be better.

16:20.858 --> 16:23.988
- I am a lucky man.
- Why do you say that?

16:24.395 --> 16:26.154
I am an important person.

16:26.211 --> 16:29.075
I have a loving and dutiful
wife and I am a policeman.

16:29.879 --> 16:33.327
- Yes. You are.
- And I am honoured to be thus.

16:33.583 --> 16:35.659
Can you imagine a more important job?

16:35.842 --> 16:37.251
And I hold it.

16:37.517 --> 16:40.938
You must be very proud of your husband
because he is the best policeman.

16:42.096 --> 16:44.444
Yes, I am.

16:45.033 --> 16:47.516
So... You're sure
everything's all right?

16:47.595 --> 16:50.428
I have never been
better. Why do you ask?

16:50.835 --> 16:54.252
Well... and don't take
this the wrong way...

16:54.487 --> 16:57.016
you're being very, very nice.

16:58.498 --> 17:01.727
Thank you. It is important to be nice.

17:01.795 --> 17:04.826
Perhaps it is the most
important thing a man can be.

17:08.979 --> 17:10.508
What are you doing?

17:10.685 --> 17:12.877
Having some plant and talking to you.

17:25.424 --> 17:27.146
Anything I can help you with?

17:27.271 --> 17:29.483
No, Doctor Ogden, thank you very much.

17:29.493 --> 17:32.529
- We were just waiting for our friend.
- Henry.

17:42.271 --> 17:44.254
How many feet of wire
do we have, George?

17:44.259 --> 17:48.688
- Sir, a hundred feet, almost.
- That should do it. Let it out.

17:52.041 --> 17:54.637
You really think the meteorite
is down there, George?

17:54.762 --> 17:56.770
Meteor, sir.

17:56.812 --> 18:00.178
Not exactly, George. When
a meteor is in the sky,

18:00.188 --> 18:02.463
it is a meteor, but
when it hits the ground,

18:02.473 --> 18:04.962
it is then technically
referred to as a meteorite.

18:05.338 --> 18:06.783
Why is that?

18:07.806 --> 18:09.350
It just is.

18:09.679 --> 18:12.251
Well, it seems an
unnecessary complication.

18:13.774 --> 18:17.014
And you are quite sure you...
you heard something down there?

18:17.072 --> 18:18.726
More than that, sir.

18:19.169 --> 18:21.178
I threw a piece of wood down there.

18:21.507 --> 18:24.574
- Something threw it back.
- Hello!

18:24.908 --> 18:27.166
Would you gentlemen like some tea?

18:28.152 --> 18:30.656
Thank you, but no.

18:30.833 --> 18:33.322
You know, you two don't have to be here.

18:33.447 --> 18:37.157
I have a man coming by to
fix the hole in the wall.

18:37.282 --> 18:40.767
And he gave me a very fair deal.

18:41.492 --> 18:43.506
And he can start soon enough.

18:43.516 --> 18:45.656
We won't be taking up much of your time.

18:46.042 --> 18:49.041
You think something criminal
is going on down there?

18:51.510 --> 18:52.976
I don't know.

18:53.101 --> 18:54.808
You're a detective, aren't you?

18:54.865 --> 18:57.307
Isn't it your job to fight crime?

18:57.641 --> 19:01.841
It is. But this is more
of a scientific endeavour.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.930
That's it, sir. I've reached the end.

19:15.756 --> 19:18.652
- Fascinating!
- Do you hear something, sir?

19:20.473 --> 19:23.932
- Can you hear something, sir?
- Yes! Yes!

19:26.880 --> 19:28.340
It appears you were right, George.

19:28.341 --> 19:32.510
There is definitely
something down there.

19:37.550 --> 19:40.415
Sir! No, I... I won't.

19:42.684 --> 19:44.432
I suppose not.

19:46.258 --> 19:47.782
Aaah!

19:48.470 --> 19:50.761
Quick, George, get something
so we can capture it.

19:59.297 --> 20:01.880
- Good Lord, sir. What is it?
- I don't know.

20:02.323 --> 20:04.191
It's from space!

20:05.130 --> 20:08.213
Let's just say it's from the ground.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.381
What's wrong?

20:14.678 --> 20:16.092
Nothing.

20:17.115 --> 20:18.570
Everything.

20:18.695 --> 20:21.586
- I don't know.
- Why do you say that?

20:21.711 --> 20:25.295
The station hasn't received a
single call today. Not one complaint.

20:25.327 --> 20:28.227
No littering, no loitering,
not even any lollygagging.

20:28.232 --> 20:30.721
- And that's bad?
- It's not right.

20:31.696 --> 20:33.799
Best of the day to you, Inspector.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.668
See? Everyone's being
so damned pleasant.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.442
You know what I would do if I were you.

20:38.463 --> 20:40.169
- What?
- Enjoy it.

20:40.216 --> 20:44.177
The world is not often
this way. I know that.

20:44.641 --> 20:48.001
- I just don't much care for it.
- Oh, Thomas.

20:56.042 --> 20:57.900
It's just a lot of noise.

20:58.703 --> 21:02.015
Sir, I believe it
could be something more.

21:02.235 --> 21:04.118
Do you? What?

21:04.306 --> 21:05.652
I don't know.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.948
Well, it's bloody annoying.

21:07.974 --> 21:10.290
Where is your sense of inquiry?

21:10.342 --> 21:14.395
Something has landed
here on Earth, from space.

21:14.630 --> 21:16.633
And now these noises. Sir,

21:16.659 --> 21:20.259
I think it's possible something could
be trying to communicate with us.

21:20.384 --> 21:22.878
All right. What are they saying?

21:22.914 --> 21:24.542
I don't know.

21:24.605 --> 21:27.187
Then who cares if they're
trying to communicate or not?

21:27.224 --> 21:31.071
Sir, we could be on the
threshold of a whole new era.

21:32.920 --> 21:35.213
Look, sir, have a listen.

21:36.398 --> 21:38.235
It's still just bloody noise.

21:38.584 --> 21:40.723
- And you've spoken to Higgins?
- I did.

21:40.728 --> 21:42.837
He's gone off his nut, has he not?

21:42.863 --> 21:46.583
I'm not sure I would phrase it
that way, but he did seem different.

21:46.601 --> 21:48.383
Different? Doctor!

21:48.404 --> 21:50.638
By the time Watts and I
got back from the farm,

21:50.659 --> 21:52.443
Higgins had done all my paperwork

21:52.469 --> 21:55.584
- and cleaned the keys of my typewriter.
- That was thoughtful.

21:55.616 --> 21:58.533
Yes, exactly. Higgins
is not a thoughtful man.

21:58.569 --> 22:00.739
It's because of those
meteors. I'm telling you.

22:00.766 --> 22:02.247
Nothing has been the same since then.

22:02.258 --> 22:05.383
Now, George, meteors are
nothing but rocks from space.

22:05.435 --> 22:07.126
Well, that may be so, but...

22:07.251 --> 22:09.375
even Watts is acting strangely.

22:09.406 --> 22:11.655
And some might say Watts
is strange to begin with.

22:11.676 --> 22:13.283
I'm telling you, something is wrong,

22:13.298 --> 22:16.539
- and it makes me very, very uncomfortable.
- Good day Constable.

22:16.580 --> 22:21.371
- Lovely day out isn't it?
- Yes, indeed. Do you see what I mean?

22:22.123 --> 22:23.725
It's just someone
being courteous, George.

22:23.746 --> 22:26.193
- It's not that unusual.
- It's Toronto.

22:27.315 --> 22:29.970
This behavior is
completely normal, George.

22:30.299 --> 22:33.148
People were very alarmed with
this recent celestial event.

22:33.164 --> 22:35.365
Some may have even thought
it the end of the world.

22:35.438 --> 22:38.385
And then the next day, the sun
comes up as it always does and

22:38.416 --> 22:40.008
everything is well.

22:40.655 --> 22:43.388
Being grateful and appreciative

22:43.414 --> 22:46.607
after avoiding a tragedy
is a most human reaction.

22:46.732 --> 22:49.055
So what are you suggesting?
That from this day forward

22:49.075 --> 22:53.045
- the world'll be a better place?
- Oh, no, George, don't worry.

22:53.077 --> 22:56.259
I am sure the murder and
mayhem will continue shortly.

23:04.393 --> 23:06.068
Hello?

23:08.216 --> 23:10.002
Hello?

23:14.103 --> 23:15.710
Who's in here?

23:16.132 --> 23:17.812
Julia!

23:21.714 --> 23:24.798
Look. Have you ever seen
anything so fascinating?

23:24.829 --> 23:27.772
- What is it?
- I have no idea.

23:27.897 --> 23:30.094
But it certainly isn't a cecrophia.

23:30.135 --> 23:32.911
And it's definitely
not of this continent.

23:32.984 --> 23:36.380
- But it's from here.
- Well, it's from the calder...

23:36.390 --> 23:39.192
uh, crater that I've been investigating.

23:39.317 --> 23:41.999
You think this is from another planet?

23:42.067 --> 23:47.728
Well, it is possible that it came
out of the inside of the meteor.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.617
How fascinating!

23:49.627 --> 23:51.166
And if you can believe it,

23:51.182 --> 23:54.114
I think they may be trying
to communicate with us.

23:54.239 --> 23:56.226
Well, what would be the
point of coming all this way

23:56.247 --> 23:58.934
if they weren't going to
say something about it?

24:07.724 --> 24:10.813
- Oh...
- That's disappointing.

24:11.614 --> 24:13.278
Hopefully there are more.

24:41.478 --> 24:43.163
Capricious...

25:32.762 --> 25:34.692
Holy herd of M...

25:41.443 --> 25:42.753
Sir!

25:42.779 --> 25:44.438
George! Listen to this.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.676
I've heard enough of that.

25:46.707 --> 25:49.723
- It is some kind of language.
- I know.

25:50.876 --> 25:52.854
George... Do you know what this means?

25:52.913 --> 25:55.133
It means you were right.

25:55.180 --> 25:59.234
We have been contacted by
creatures from another planet.

25:59.253 --> 26:02.219
- George, you were right!
- Sir!

26:02.239 --> 26:04.901
I'm pleased I was right,
but I'm not happy about it.

26:04.922 --> 26:06.977
There is something at
the bottom of that crater

26:07.034 --> 26:09.314
sending out transmissions.
I am certain of it.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.307
We need to get whatever
it is out of there.

26:11.312 --> 26:13.701
Sir, I don't think we need go that far.

26:13.743 --> 26:17.886
I believe that Constable
Higgins is one of them.

26:18.068 --> 26:20.223
As is Miss Hart, as is Detective Watts

26:20.255 --> 26:22.342
as is God knows how many people.

26:22.796 --> 26:26.086
Now, George, I've believed
everything you've said up to a point.

26:26.092 --> 26:28.669
I don't think I'm quite prepared
to push the boat all the way out.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.208
But, sir!

26:30.829 --> 26:34.147
Alright. If you think
something strange is going on,

26:34.157 --> 26:36.109
then by all means keep an eye on them.

26:36.125 --> 26:38.013
I have to find Doctor Ogden.

26:38.024 --> 26:39.641
She knows a number of clever linguists

26:39.657 --> 26:42.954
who may be able to help
decipher whatever is being said.

26:49.403 --> 26:51.015
Julia?

26:56.665 --> 26:58.110
Julia?

26:58.235 --> 26:59.942
Can I help you?

27:01.262 --> 27:03.610
Ah, yes. Have you seen Dr. Ogden?

27:03.735 --> 27:06.031
No. But I am sure I can help you.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.059
Would you like some tea?

27:09.254 --> 27:12.018
- No. It's fine.
- It's very good.

27:12.540 --> 27:15.169
You were right, it was no moth.

27:15.378 --> 27:17.429
But did you have to kill him?

27:18.112 --> 27:19.928
What harm had he done?

27:21.916 --> 27:24.744
Miss Hart, are you quite all right?

27:25.072 --> 27:27.947
Let me help you. You
don't need Dr. Ogden.

27:28.881 --> 27:32.663
Please just tell Julia that
I need to speak with her.

27:35.966 --> 27:37.813
Become one of us.

27:37.839 --> 27:40.223
Life is better if you're one of us.

27:41.215 --> 27:42.670
No!

27:45.596 --> 27:48.513
No! Aaah!

27:48.733 --> 27:51.633
No! No! No!

27:51.811 --> 27:54.299
No!

27:56.433 --> 27:58.666
Sir! I've been thinking.

27:58.687 --> 28:02.931
This... this may not be any
ordinary interplanetary visit,

28:03.129 --> 28:06.634
but rather some sort of alien invasion.

28:06.942 --> 28:10.116
- Go on.
- Sir, I believe that these space creatures

28:10.127 --> 28:14.348
have figured out a way
of changing our behaviour.

28:14.390 --> 28:18.621
I don't know if it's through these
infernal sounds they keep emitting

28:18.683 --> 28:21.121
but I believe they've
figured out a way of

28:21.138 --> 28:23.137
influencing the way that we act.

28:24.565 --> 28:26.576
The sounds, George?

28:26.634 --> 28:28.340
Sir, think about it.

28:28.357 --> 28:30.686
Higgins... Higgins is being responsible.

28:30.699 --> 28:33.148
How often does that happen?
Detective Watts is...

28:33.149 --> 28:36.338
acting as normally as you or I

28:36.371 --> 28:39.514
and Miss Hart has being
exceedingly pleasant.

28:39.639 --> 28:42.178
I mean, these are not the
normal course of events.

28:43.334 --> 28:45.793
What are you talking about, George?

28:45.810 --> 28:49.191
Sir, I believe these creatures
are taking us over one by one.

28:49.216 --> 28:50.944
You or I could be next.

28:53.603 --> 28:56.325
There is no alien invasion, George.

28:56.341 --> 28:59.283
The creature I found was just a moth.

28:59.313 --> 29:02.309
A moth? But sir, you even...

29:02.547 --> 29:04.174
You said you agreed with me.

29:04.387 --> 29:06.324
That was a joke, George.

29:06.504 --> 29:08.471
I was pulling your arm.

29:09.339 --> 29:12.686
- You, sir? A joke?
- Yes.

29:12.811 --> 29:14.881
Something to evoke laughter.

29:18.133 --> 29:19.831
And a good one at that, sir.

29:19.881 --> 29:22.836
A real knee-slapper. Yes.

29:49.738 --> 29:51.119
- Crabtree!
- Aaaah!

29:51.165 --> 29:53.315
- What are you doing?
- Inspector! Uh...

29:53.352 --> 29:56.049
The Detective asked me to gather
up some of his recording equipment.

29:56.116 --> 29:57.389
Of course he did.

29:57.818 --> 29:59.939
- Sir?
- Well, typical bloody Murdoch.

29:59.952 --> 30:02.135
Always scared of a little
heavy lifting. And digging.

30:02.160 --> 30:04.494
Sir, thank God! I have to
talk to you about something.

30:04.514 --> 30:05.905
Thomas.

30:07.353 --> 30:10.016
- It'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
- Sir! It's important.

30:10.037 --> 30:13.470
Are you saying that my wife,
Margaret Brackenreid, isn't?

30:15.906 --> 30:17.984
Oh, Thomas!

30:18.994 --> 30:20.784
I'll talk to you when
I'm good and ready.

30:21.870 --> 30:23.097
Coming, darling!

30:23.155 --> 30:25.864
Mmmm...

30:30.743 --> 30:34.159
And you are telling me that
one of these voices is William?

30:34.524 --> 30:36.329
I'm afraid so, Doctor.

30:36.559 --> 30:39.180
It's clear now that he has
become one of these creatures.

30:39.698 --> 30:41.651
No! No.

30:41.727 --> 30:42.842
It's not possible.

30:42.858 --> 30:45.454
Doctor, I know you don't want
to believe it, but it's true.

30:45.504 --> 30:47.821
Even the Detective believed that

30:47.984 --> 30:50.672
space aliens were
taking over this planet.

30:50.697 --> 30:53.281
That is until he became one
of the creatures himself.

30:53.590 --> 30:56.282
Now, George, you are
letting your imagination...

30:56.303 --> 30:58.306
Doctor! You've seen
it with your own eyes.

30:58.331 --> 31:01.513
People all over this city
are acting differently.

31:01.541 --> 31:04.965
There are people who were
near and dear to us who are...

31:05.389 --> 31:08.387
who are no longer themselves.

31:08.813 --> 31:11.375
Space aliens are taking over the world!

31:12.152 --> 31:13.876
I need to talk to William about this.

31:13.888 --> 31:15.854
You cannot talk to William about this.

31:15.871 --> 31:17.624
William is no more.

31:17.662 --> 31:21.038
- No!
- Doctor! Look, you need to find him

31:21.092 --> 31:22.908
and restrain him somehow

31:22.983 --> 31:25.826
until we can figure out
what to do about this.

31:26.310 --> 31:28.752
I'm sorry, I feel awful about it.

31:29.046 --> 31:31.227
And I feel awful of a personal level.

31:31.582 --> 31:33.661
What do you mean, George?

31:34.082 --> 31:36.236
You may not be aware of this but

31:36.896 --> 31:40.364
over the years, I've had some
rather fantastical theories.

31:41.157 --> 31:43.899
And I've always wished that
one of them would come true.

31:44.408 --> 31:46.116
And now that it has...

31:47.890 --> 31:49.604
... I've lost my best friend.

31:52.815 --> 31:54.493
I'm going to go home.

31:54.551 --> 31:56.492
- And if William is there...
- Then you need to...

31:56.496 --> 31:59.110
You need to lock him up. Lock
him in the potato cooking room!

31:59.135 --> 32:01.072
- Turn it on if you have to.
- George!

32:01.076 --> 32:02.696
I'm telling you, Doctor!

32:04.044 --> 32:05.480
Do you know how to use this?

32:06.031 --> 32:08.073
- Yes. Of course.
- Then use it if you have to.

32:09.292 --> 32:11.454
Are you suggesting I kill my husband?

32:11.471 --> 32:13.946
Doctor, he is no longer your husband.

32:17.277 --> 32:18.904
What about the rest of them?

32:19.976 --> 32:22.844
Constable Higgins, Detective Watts...

32:24.655 --> 32:26.770
Don't worry. I think I have an idea.

32:30.418 --> 32:32.184
Watts! Higgins!

32:32.222 --> 32:34.601
- Yes, George.
- I need your help.

32:34.655 --> 32:36.734
Certainly. That is why we are here.

32:36.809 --> 32:37.949
To help.

32:38.800 --> 32:42.043
- Right. There's a ruckus in the cells.
- A ruckus?

32:42.068 --> 32:43.516
We can't be having that.

32:43.783 --> 32:46.488
- Let's get to it.
- Wait! Watts, you come with me.

32:46.501 --> 32:48.112
Higgins, I need you to fetch Miss Hart.

32:48.125 --> 32:51.005
- One of the prisoners needs medical attention.
- Certainly, George.

32:51.702 --> 32:53.301
Police action.

32:57.996 --> 32:59.698
I wouldn't get too close to him, Watts,

32:59.699 --> 33:01.285
we don't know what he's ailing from.

33:01.923 --> 33:03.546
Where are the other prisoners?

33:03.913 --> 33:07.741
Well, we haven't really had any
other prisoners in several days.

33:08.013 --> 33:11.281
It was just this chap who was acting up.

33:11.715 --> 33:14.281
Ah, Miss Hart. Please come in.

33:15.175 --> 33:16.661
Higgins.

33:22.559 --> 33:24.617
I don't know who you are

33:24.626 --> 33:26.229
or what you have done with my friends,

33:26.262 --> 33:29.130
but it takes a great deal to
put one over on George Crabtree.

33:29.167 --> 33:30.820
A great deal indeed.

33:32.865 --> 33:34.940
This planet is ours, not yours.

33:34.961 --> 33:37.465
And you won't be taking
it from George Crabtree,

33:37.478 --> 33:41.154
Toronto Constabulary, human being.

33:51.488 --> 33:53.842
- All of them?
- Everyone of them, sir.

33:53.967 --> 33:55.795
Even the Detective, I fear.

33:56.471 --> 33:57.870
That is troubling.

33:58.433 --> 34:00.287
It's a lot more than troubling, sir.

34:01.560 --> 34:03.613
Do you think we should
do something about it?

34:03.901 --> 34:05.374
Yes. Of course.

34:07.336 --> 34:09.135
Sir, what are you doing?

34:12.178 --> 34:14.098
We need to formulate a plan.

34:23.384 --> 34:24.777
William?

34:27.908 --> 34:31.005
Welcome home, Julia. How was your day?

34:31.568 --> 34:33.684
It was lovely. You?

34:34.025 --> 34:35.726
It was most pleasant.

34:38.543 --> 34:41.034
Would you like to have romance?

34:41.498 --> 34:42.891
Pardon?

34:43.168 --> 34:46.212
It's what a husband
and wife do, is it not?

34:49.291 --> 34:52.420
- Let me get changed.
- I can help you with that.

34:52.463 --> 34:55.168
Uh... Not now, William.

34:55.554 --> 34:57.782
I want romance.

34:58.439 --> 35:00.556
Not another step!

35:02.472 --> 35:04.293
Romance.

35:07.131 --> 35:10.433
Aaaah!

35:17.128 --> 35:19.266
You don't want romance?

35:24.625 --> 35:26.159
William...

35:26.827 --> 35:30.135
So what do you think we should
do about this alien invasion?

35:31.063 --> 35:34.601
Sir, we need to... tell somebody.

35:34.628 --> 35:37.126
The army. The Prime Minister.

35:37.227 --> 35:40.273
We need to mobilize our forces

35:40.293 --> 35:44.196
and beat back these invaders.
We need to save the world.

35:44.321 --> 35:45.641
Are you sure?

35:46.601 --> 35:49.961
- Yes, I think so.
- Don't you think this is for the best?

35:50.018 --> 35:52.549
- The best?
- Look at the world.

35:52.674 --> 35:55.977
It's all so much more peaceful.

35:57.687 --> 36:01.153
Well, sir... You might
be thinking that...

36:02.175 --> 36:03.642
but...

36:04.586 --> 36:06.694
- I should go.
- But why?

36:06.976 --> 36:09.825
We've only just started to talk
about what we're going to do.

36:10.507 --> 36:13.462
Yes, sir, but I might be
mistaken about the whole thing.

36:13.483 --> 36:15.949
I mean, uh... I'm certainly
not sleeping very much.

36:15.978 --> 36:17.765
I'm sure my mind is
playing tricks on me.

36:17.799 --> 36:19.610
No, George, I believe you.

36:20.058 --> 36:21.410
I want to help you.

36:21.919 --> 36:23.247
That is my job.

36:23.443 --> 36:24.573
To help.

36:25.041 --> 36:26.481
I'm a policeman.

36:30.276 --> 36:33.598
It is my duty to serve and protect.

36:37.921 --> 36:39.617
Sir?

36:41.658 --> 36:42.860
Sir!

36:49.626 --> 36:51.412
Man's best friend.

37:04.924 --> 37:06.961
- Hello?
- Doctor!

37:07.479 --> 37:10.183
- You better be right, George Crabtree.
- I believe I am.

37:10.229 --> 37:12.097
I just killed my husband.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.458
Dear God, I listened to George Crabtree

37:14.471 --> 37:17.401
- and killed my husband.
- He wasn't your husband anymore.

37:17.418 --> 37:19.914
He was just some sort of bug.

37:19.930 --> 37:21.529
Listen, Doctor, whether
you like it or not,

37:21.542 --> 37:23.691
Detective William Murdoch is no more.

37:23.770 --> 37:26.692
Watts is no more, Higgins, Miss Hart,

37:26.717 --> 37:28.654
even the Inspector, they're all gone.

37:28.663 --> 37:31.092
- The Inspector's wife?
- Hard to tell.

37:31.375 --> 37:34.068
Hard to tell with her. But listen,
Doctor, I want you to stay there.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.788
I think I have an answer.

37:35.833 --> 37:37.544
What do you mean you have the answer?

37:37.578 --> 37:38.966
You think you can bring them back?

37:38.987 --> 37:41.324
No. But I think I know how to kill them.

37:41.366 --> 37:42.916
And if we can kill them,

37:43.220 --> 37:45.149
we just might be able to save the world.

37:45.801 --> 37:47.394
- Please hurry, George.
- I will.

37:47.410 --> 37:49.034
Don't let anybody in.

37:49.602 --> 37:50.917
I won't.

37:55.132 --> 37:56.530
Romance?

38:08.100 --> 38:09.381
Higgins?

38:09.970 --> 38:11.076
Watts?

38:28.937 --> 38:31.625
Good day, Constable. I'd like
to thank you for all that you do.

38:31.644 --> 38:33.521
- You're very welcome.
- Could I buy you a tea?

38:33.529 --> 38:34.893
- Thank you, no.
- Are you sure?

38:34.909 --> 38:36.800
I really think you
should join us for tea.

38:36.821 --> 38:38.353
I can't.

38:41.595 --> 38:42.998
I knew it!

38:47.588 --> 38:48.950
Alright.

38:55.348 --> 38:58.345
You should've said you'd like
something stronger than tea.

38:58.387 --> 39:00.291
Tea? Yes, I've never...

39:00.416 --> 39:01.952
I've never fancied the stuff.

39:02.470 --> 39:04.524
These fellows certainly
needed their rest.

39:04.649 --> 39:05.935
Rest?

39:06.465 --> 39:07.751
Yes.

39:09.114 --> 39:10.242
I'll tell you what.

39:10.322 --> 39:12.271
Why don't you have

39:12.312 --> 39:14.111
a drink of what I'm drinking?

39:14.166 --> 39:18.978
I assure you... it's
much better than tea.

39:18.987 --> 39:20.509
I'd love it. Thank you.

39:21.786 --> 39:23.147
Should we toast?

39:23.493 --> 39:26.353
Certainly. To your health.

39:37.101 --> 39:38.670
Aaaah!

39:39.476 --> 39:41.208
Aaaah!

39:41.737 --> 39:46.483
Aaaaah!

39:47.490 --> 39:48.946
Burning...

39:59.235 --> 40:01.134
Careful picking your poison.

40:24.583 --> 40:26.278
The one they call Crabtree.

40:26.679 --> 40:27.872
He knows.

40:28.127 --> 40:29.843
Then we must find him.

40:39.872 --> 40:42.773
- Thievery is a crime.
- I'm a policeman.

40:42.782 --> 40:44.610
Then it is a worse crime.

40:44.735 --> 40:46.496
Oh, good God!

40:46.712 --> 40:49.814
Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya!

40:52.126 --> 40:54.009
Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya!

40:55.482 --> 40:57.887
Ya! Ya! Ya!

41:00.546 --> 41:01.815
Doctor!

41:03.142 --> 41:05.684
Doctor Ogden? Doctor! Ah!

41:05.809 --> 41:08.418
Doctor, I think I may have found it.

41:09.635 --> 41:11.512
I believe I've found a solution.

41:11.917 --> 41:13.786
Solution to what, George?

41:15.080 --> 41:16.445
What's going on here?

41:17.009 --> 41:18.370
You're supposed to be dead.

41:18.566 --> 41:21.362
Dead? Why would he be dead, George?

41:21.412 --> 41:23.007
You said you killed him.

41:23.746 --> 41:25.532
I am his loving wife.

41:25.925 --> 41:29.143
Why would I kill him? I'm
to honour and obey him.

41:29.185 --> 41:31.606
No... Not you as well.

41:31.652 --> 41:34.907
She's my loving wife, George,
why wouldn't she join us?

41:34.924 --> 41:36.710
You can too, George.

41:37.294 --> 41:38.801
Would you like some tea?

41:38.834 --> 41:41.539
We could talk about it. It's
good to talk about things.

41:41.556 --> 41:42.725
Yes.

41:42.925 --> 41:45.300
- Hello, old friend.
- What?

41:46.185 --> 41:47.433
You're dead!

41:47.558 --> 41:49.766
Why do you think
everyone is dead, George?

41:49.891 --> 41:52.650
Can't you see? We're all right as rain.

41:52.679 --> 41:55.266
- Would you like some tea?
- No, I would not.

41:55.700 --> 41:57.140
What are you doing here?

41:57.303 --> 41:59.182
Why don't you just leave us alone?

41:59.407 --> 42:01.289
Stop it!

42:01.414 --> 42:04.273
You're not from here!
You don't belong here!

42:04.536 --> 42:08.033
- We want to help.
- We want to make a better world.

42:08.071 --> 42:09.665
Our world is just fine.

42:09.736 --> 42:11.810
- No, it's not.
- To me it is.

42:11.827 --> 42:14.136
Don't you see? To have a better world...

42:14.152 --> 42:15.580
All humans must die.

42:15.588 --> 42:17.831
We have watched your
world for a long time

42:18.124 --> 42:19.705
- and all we see is...
- Crime.

42:19.731 --> 42:20.920
- Disease.
- Death.

42:20.941 --> 42:22.874
- Murder.
- And mayhem.

42:23.508 --> 42:25.348
All humans must die, George,

42:25.361 --> 42:27.999
so that all of the other
creatures on this world

42:28.013 --> 42:29.460
- can live.
- No.

42:29.940 --> 42:32.875
No. No! No! No!

42:34.293 --> 42:36.455
Don't struggle, Bugalugs.

42:36.956 --> 42:39.343
- Bugalugs.
- That is a good one.

42:39.377 --> 42:41.029
Why, thank you, Henry.

42:41.902 --> 42:43.943
From this day forward,

42:43.964 --> 42:45.900
we will all be bugalugs.

42:45.963 --> 42:47.766
Bugalugs! Bugalugs!

42:47.778 --> 42:50.228
Bugalugs! Bugalugs!
Bugalugs! Bugalugs! Bugalugs!

42:50.662 --> 42:52.573
Would you like the honour?

42:53.187 --> 42:56.318
I thought you would never ask.

42:57.331 --> 43:00.495
No! No! No!

43:00.520 --> 43:02.365
No!

43:16.359 --> 43:18.559
Help! I need help!

43:19.119 --> 43:21.443
Tom! Tom!

43:21.502 --> 43:23.848
They're out there. They're everywhere!

43:24.082 --> 43:26.164
Why don't you have a seat?

43:27.312 --> 43:29.495
- Have some tea.
- Uh?

43:29.524 --> 43:31.147
Let's talk about it.

43:35.084 --> 43:36.637
Help!

43:38.684 --> 43:41.018
Aaaaah!
