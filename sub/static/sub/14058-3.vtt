00:01.035 --> 00:04.572
I'm Wayne Malloy.
My family and I are Travellers.

00:04.605 --> 00:08.376
Our kind has been
living in this country
for 150 years.

00:08.409 --> 00:11.512
We're not listed
in the phone book. We don't
have Social Security numbers.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.281
We live off the grid.

00:13.314 --> 00:16.217
Some call us gypsies.
Others call us thieves.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.253
- Cael!
- Most, though,
don't even know we exist.

00:19.287 --> 00:23.291
I've got three kids:
a boy, a girl and, um--

00:24.858 --> 00:28.062
My wife, Dahlia,
is just out of jail on parole.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.398
We took her home
to the Traveller camp.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.301
The family gave her
a warm welcome.

00:33.334 --> 00:36.170
- Oh.
- I, on the other hand, got
a different type of welcome.

00:36.204 --> 00:38.539
I am the new boss.
He is the old boss.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.709
- [ Bell Ringing ]
- Get over it.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.512
[ Wayne Narrating ] Sometimes
it takes a beating to make you
realize it's time to move on.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.414
So where are we gonna go?

00:48.816 --> 00:52.386
Life's a river, kid.
You gotta go
where it takes you.

00:52.420 --> 00:56.657
[ Wayne Narrating ]
So, with a loan from
the family bank,

00:56.690 --> 00:58.859
I packed up the R.V.
and went out in search of
something better.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.761
- [ Linda ]
Wayne, you hear me?
- Shit!

01:00.794 --> 01:03.231
[ Wayne Narrating ]
It wasn't that long before
the family tried to stop us.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.399
You're in the wrong lane,
asshole! Mick! Look out!

01:09.803 --> 01:12.673
[ Wayne Narrating ]
Unfortunately, they stopped
someone else instead.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.275
And then they ran.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.383
[ Dahlia ]
She's breathing!

01:22.416 --> 01:25.153
[ Wayne Narrating ]
Knowing that we couldn't
go back to our old home,

01:25.186 --> 01:29.657
we decided to visit
their new home,
Edenfalls, as the Riches.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.592
[ Dahlia ]
Now, who buys a house
on the Internet?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.794
Come and meet
our new neighbors.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.797
Doug, meet Hugh Panetta,
biggest asshole
east of the Mississippi.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.733
[ Chuckles ]
You flatter me, Jim.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.370
Dougie was looking for work...

01:42.403 --> 01:45.773
as a lawyer,
and you've got
a lunch interview today.

01:45.806 --> 01:49.843
A good lawyer
makes you believe the truth.

01:49.877 --> 01:55.316
- Doug.
- A great lawyer
makes you believe the lie.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.418
- [ Clicks ]
- Oh!

01:57.451 --> 02:01.555
You're a sick mother, Doug,
and I like that in a liar.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.591
[ Wayne Narrating ]
I've taken many things
in my life,

02:03.624 --> 02:06.727
but I'm on my way
to taking something
I never thought possible.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.730
[ Wayne's Voice ]
The American dream.
We're gonna steal it.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.833
[ Wayne Narrating ]
Will the past
ever catch up with us?

02:12.866 --> 02:15.303
- [ Cell Phone Buzzing ]
- I don't know.

02:15.336 --> 02:18.206
[ Woman ]
Doug? I know you're there.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.709
Don't you hang up
on me, Doug.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.378
[ Wayne Narrating ]
But I'll be damned if
I go down without a fight.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.288
[ Di Di ]
Dad, do we really have
to do this?

02:34.322 --> 02:37.191
Why can't we just crank
the blue plate special
like we always do?

02:37.225 --> 02:39.327
Blue plate special
has its flaws.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.663
Dad's right, honey.
Funny chits and phony slangs
only get you so far.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.366
Come on, cupcake.
Get out of the car.
I am not goin'!

02:45.399 --> 02:48.436
[ Di Di ] Yes, you are, Cael.
I'm not-- I don't want--
I don't want a damn number!

02:48.469 --> 02:52.406
Get out.
No one's gonna own you,
honey. Come here.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.642
Dad, I don't wanna be
a number either.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.910
Nobody is going
to be a number.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.912
Sammy,
take those shoes off.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.450
Come on.

03:02.483 --> 03:05.253
But I like
the shoes.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.221
We're not a family
of shoe-wearers.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.690
We are a family
of missionaries.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.928
Missionaries?

03:14.962 --> 03:19.267
We've been spreadin'
the good word, ma'am.
Here's our paperwork.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.907
What country are these
birth certificates from?

03:26.940 --> 03:29.710
Indonesia.
The, uh, wife and I
are U.S. citizens.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.813
The kids all born
in Pare-Pare in Indonesia.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.815
Pare-Pare.
That's right.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.884
Pare-Pare, born and bred.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.453
- But you're a priest?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.289
A Catholic priest?

03:43.391 --> 03:45.526
Yes, ma'am.

03:45.559 --> 03:49.430
Uh, I'm spreadin'
the good word,
spreadin' the good seed.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.698
So good.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.769
That's nice.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.738
And what's your name, hon?

03:57.771 --> 04:00.874
[ Gibberish ]

04:00.908 --> 04:04.278
Delilah.
Her name is Delilah.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.581
She was bitten by a monkey
when she was eight,
so her English is not so good.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.884
[ Children Shouting

04:12.520 --> 04:14.822
[ Mouths Words ]

04:14.855 --> 04:17.491
[ Gibberish ]

04:17.525 --> 04:19.593
Sorry, ma'am.
Quit scratching, honey.

04:19.627 --> 04:24.898
He got bitten by
a tsetse fly at the airport.
Big old son of a bitch.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.435
So now we're back
on U.S. soil.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.804
We wanted to get the kids
all socially secured.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.040
You know, with cards.

04:36.610 --> 04:41.349
God bless you.
God bless you.

04:41.382 --> 04:45.386
God bless you.
God bless you.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.515
Problems with the newlyweds.
That guy Pete,

05:14.548 --> 05:17.551
he e-mailed again and said
he wants to reschedule
the golf trip.

05:17.585 --> 05:20.521
Good. Reschedule.
Tell him the mono's
really kicking in...

05:20.554 --> 05:22.590
and it's
contagious as hell.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.625
Don't come around.
Didn't like you anyway,
weasel.

05:24.658 --> 05:28.095
Do you have to
call 'em "newlyweds"?
They're newlyweds.

05:28.128 --> 05:32.800
- So how do we use these cards?
- We use 'em to enroll
you kids in school.

05:34.134 --> 05:37.538
Would you stop scaring 'em?
I'm serious.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.607
So am I!
[ Di Di ]
Dad, come on.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.976
School?
Who wants to learn a bunch
of buffer bullshit?

05:43.010 --> 05:45.879
School is the cornerstone
of buffer society.

05:45.913 --> 05:49.850
It's where you meet a lot
of buffer friends and learn
really important things.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.685
Wayne, it will kill
their tiny minds.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.388
I went to school
till seventh grade.
Didn't kill my mind.

05:54.422 --> 05:57.591
- Well, you're a half-breed.
- Ooh!

05:59.192 --> 06:01.094
I'm just sayin'.

06:02.996 --> 06:06.434
Come on.
It'll be real fun,
won't it?

06:06.467 --> 06:08.669
When was the last time
you were in
an educational facility?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.038
Fifty minutes outside Georgia,
ripping off that school.

06:11.071 --> 06:14.975
- Yeah. Wasn't that great?
- Dad, it sucked.

06:15.008 --> 06:18.779
What else do we really
need to know?
You taught us everything.

06:18.812 --> 06:22.916
We're smart. We're crafty.
We're self-taught.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.686
We're auto-dy-namic.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.022
Auto-- Shit.
What is that again?

06:29.056 --> 06:32.159
The word is autodidact,
and if you don't know,
you're not self-taught.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.027
I know history.
Oh, really?

06:34.061 --> 06:37.097
All of it?
Who's Sulla?

06:37.130 --> 06:40.901
The guy from Star Wars.
He was the first
dictator of Rome.

06:40.934 --> 06:44.805
Freak. I read a book
on Joan of Arc.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.074
Look, this is not
an education, kids.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.477
I do not want my children
in no buffer facility.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.745
Stop being scared
of school.

06:51.779 --> 06:56.083
Okay? Nothing to be scared of.
Knowledge is power.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.752
That's the end of it.

Because you're worth it.

They're legit.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.806
Now just 'cause
you grew up a buffer,

08:58.839 --> 09:00.908
it don't give you the right
to call me ignorant, you know.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.646
I never
called you ignorant.
