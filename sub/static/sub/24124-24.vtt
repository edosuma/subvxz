WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:03.166
I gotta get goin'

00:03.166 --> 00:06.583
a friend of mine

00:06.583 --> 00:08.333
and he's fuzzy

00:08.333 --> 00:11.291
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.958 --> 00:17.375
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.375 --> 00:20.833
I know he's out there

00:24.583 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.375
and again

00:31.375 --> 00:34.875
and there's nobody home

00:34.875 --> 00:38.333
to count on a friend

00:38.333 --> 00:41.875
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.375
take me, please?

00:45.375 --> 00:48.750
I gotta be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.333
Winnie the Pooh

01:10.875 --> 01:13.708
on the piratey ship

01:15.500 --> 01:17.625
by acres of woods

01:17.625 --> 01:19.875
through the trees

01:19.875 --> 01:23.958
a pirate's life is free

01:23.958 --> 01:27.958
pirates is what we'll be

01:27.958 --> 01:29.958
the captain speaks

01:29.958 --> 01:31.875
swab the deck

01:31.875 --> 01:33.583
your Robin is missin'

01:33.583 --> 01:35.875
lunch time next?

01:35.875 --> 01:39.875
a pirate's life is free

01:39.875 --> 01:43.708
pirates is what we'll be

01:43.708 --> 01:45.958
seek buried treasure

01:45.958 --> 01:47.875
Gopher:

01:47.875 --> 01:51.875
a pirate's life is free

01:51.875 --> 01:55.125
Pooh:
Oh, yo--
How does it go?

01:58.125 --> 02:00.208
-

02:05.208 --> 02:07.458
What is going on here?

02:07.458 --> 02:09.458
It's us, Rabbit.

02:09.458 --> 02:11.708
We're pirates,
you see.

02:11.708 --> 02:13.166
And I'm the captain.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.458
We're diggin'
for treasure.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.750
Not in my garden!

02:17.750 --> 02:19.958
Go play somewhere else.

02:19.958 --> 02:21.000
Piglet:
Pooh, get the sail.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.458
Aye, aye.

02:22.458 --> 02:24.458
- Swab the mizzenmast.
- Gopher: Aye, aye.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.625
- Foot the yard arm.
- All: Aye, aye.

02:33.583 --> 02:38.166
I am not going to get mad.

02:38.166 --> 02:41.708
I am going to
teach them a lesson!

02:45.708 --> 02:48.375
So Captain Piglet
and his pitiful pirates

02:48.375 --> 02:51.166
want to find
buried treasure,
do they?

02:51.166 --> 02:53.291
Well, I'll give 'em
a treasure.

02:53.291 --> 02:56.583
A worthless one.

02:56.583 --> 03:00.000
And a map to
help 'em find it.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.833
- All: Whoa!
- Piglet: Oh, d-d-dear.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.875
Quick.
Haul in the sail.

03:07.625 --> 03:09.375
Help! We're sinking.

03:09.375 --> 03:12.500
Abandon ship.
Tiggers and Tiggers first.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.000
But, uh,
what about Piglets?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.208
Uh, Piglets?

03:16.208 --> 03:18.375
Why--

03:18.375 --> 03:20.333
It's their duty
as captains

03:20.333 --> 03:22.208
to go down
with their ships.

03:22.208 --> 03:24.416
Oh, dear.
Are you sure?

03:24.416 --> 03:26.583
Absotootly
posilootly.

03:26.583 --> 03:29.750
Then my last command as--
as captain is, uh,

03:29.750 --> 03:31.125
Tigger,
you're captain.

03:31.125 --> 03:33.000
And as captain
of this ship,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.583
I hereby proclaim
you captain.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.708
- No, you are.
- You are.

03:38.708 --> 03:40.583
- Piglet: No, you.
- Tigger: No, you.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.250
- Piglet: No, you.
- Oh, look.

03:42.250 --> 03:45.583
Captain Piglet.
A message in a bottle.

03:45.583 --> 03:48.250
Did I hear someone yell?

03:48.250 --> 03:52.208
Yeah, bunny boy.
Look what we found.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.500
A genuine treasure map.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.875
Oh, why, so you have.

03:57.875 --> 04:01.625
Oh, this belonged to my
great, great, great uncle,

04:01.625 --> 04:03.708
Long John Cottontail,

04:03.708 --> 04:06.458
the most famous
rabbit pirate ever.

04:06.458 --> 04:09.708
And the only
rabbit pirate ever.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.250
Tigger: Find treasure
is what Captain Piglet

04:11.250 --> 04:12.833
and his pirates do best.

04:12.833 --> 04:13.875
Come on.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.250
Piglet: Six, seven,
eight, nine,

04:18.250 --> 04:20.250
ten paces from the rock.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.375
The treasure.
We found it.

04:22.375 --> 04:25.375
And it's exacticly
what I always dreamed of.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.958
My very own X.

04:27.958 --> 04:31.583
The treasure's
under the X, Tigger.

04:31.583 --> 04:33.708
You have to dig it up!

04:34.875 --> 04:36.708
Oh. Hoo-hoo-hoo!
So we do.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.500
We found it!

04:42.500 --> 04:45.208
Well, about time.

04:45.208 --> 04:47.291
Well, what are we
waitin' for?

04:47.291 --> 04:50.000
Let's bash that
dinghy open.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.708
Oh, wait.
If we open it here,

04:52.708 --> 04:54.708
someone might come
and steal it.

04:54.708 --> 04:56.458
You're right,
Captain Piglet.

04:56.458 --> 04:59.458
Uh, we better stash it
somewhere safe.

05:02.375 --> 05:05.416
Oh, I can hardly wait.

05:05.416 --> 05:08.458
What do you suppose
is inside?

05:08.458 --> 05:11.166
Ooh, probably a whole bunch
of fun stuff.

05:11.166 --> 05:13.416
Pirates were famous
fun lovers, you know.

05:13.416 --> 05:16.625
But then again,
it could be...

05:16.625 --> 05:18.583
- honey.
- Piglet: Honey?

05:18.583 --> 05:22.708
Well, if I were filling
a chest with treasure,

05:22.708 --> 05:24.000
it would be honey.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.875
On your marks.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.291
Get set.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.416
Let go!

05:37.458 --> 05:38.708
Piglet: Where'd it go?

05:38.708 --> 05:40.000
Tigger: In the basement.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.833
Piglet: But I don't have
a basement.

05:41.833 --> 05:42.875
Tigger: You do now.

05:47.875 --> 05:51.750
I never dreamed the trick
would turn out so well.

05:51.750 --> 05:55.458
When they find that chest
is full of rocks,

05:55.458 --> 05:59.625
they'll think twice about
tearing up gardens.

05:59.625 --> 06:04.375
Ahh, Rabbit,
you are a genius.

06:04.375 --> 06:08.208
Genius.
Genius.

06:08.208 --> 06:10.208
Genius.

06:10.208 --> 06:13.875
Yes. An absolute
and complete genius.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.375
That's what I am.

06:17.416 --> 06:19.625
Genius, hm?

06:21.750 --> 06:25.333
It wasn't a
very nice thing
to do, Rabbit.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.458
Oh!

06:26.458 --> 06:29.375
You built up
all our hopes.

06:31.375 --> 06:34.000
You got us all
exciterated.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And what'd we get?
Huh?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.708
A bunch of rocks.

06:37.708 --> 06:40.500
Uh, I'm sorry.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.166
It was a joke.

06:42.166 --> 06:43.875
It was just a joke!

06:43.875 --> 06:48.375
A j-ohhhh-ke!

06:48.375 --> 06:50.875
It was--
It was just a joke.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.166
Just a--
Just a--

06:53.166 --> 06:55.000
Oh, my.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.583
It was just a bad dream.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.125
Oh, no.

06:58.125 --> 07:01.458
When they find out
what's in that chest,

07:01.458 --> 07:03.583
they'll hate me forever.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.875
I've got to get it back

07:05.875 --> 07:08.125
before they open it.

07:13.750 --> 07:16.708
Now for the
finishing touch.

07:18.416 --> 07:19.875
Achoo!

07:21.208 --> 07:24.208
Hello, in there.

07:24.208 --> 07:26.875
It is I--
Achoo!

07:26.875 --> 07:31.750
The ghost of
Long John Cottontail.

07:31.750 --> 07:35.375
I've come for my treasure.

07:35.375 --> 07:38.958
Oooooooh!

07:38.958 --> 07:40.375
Oh, dear.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.875
It is the ghost of
Long John Cottontail.

07:42.875 --> 07:44.708
What do we do now?

07:44.708 --> 07:47.875
Uh, uh, you better
go talk to him,

07:47.875 --> 07:49.416
Captain Piglet.

07:49.416 --> 07:51.250
Me?

07:51.250 --> 07:54.083
Perhaps we should just
give him his treasure.

07:54.083 --> 07:56.458
Um, after all,
it is his.

07:56.458 --> 08:00.958
Nah, just tell that ghost
it's finder's keepers.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.958
Lower the draw bridge.

08:05.750 --> 08:10.458
Arrr! I've come for
what's mine, and--

08:10.458 --> 08:12.583
My goodness.

08:12.583 --> 08:15.583
He seems to have
disappeared.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.583
Yeah.

08:17.583 --> 08:18.750
Ghosties do that,
you know.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.250
Tigger: Come on.
We gotta open that treasure

08:22.250 --> 08:25.000
before Long John
Boogely Bones comes back.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.500
Gopher: Eh, why didn't I
think of it before?

08:27.500 --> 08:29.416
We'll blast it open.

08:29.416 --> 08:30.625
Piglet: Don't forget.

08:30.625 --> 08:32.750
We have to share it
with Rabbit.

08:32.750 --> 08:35.500
Share? With me?

08:35.500 --> 08:37.375
Piglet: If Rabbit hadn't
shown us where to dig,

08:37.375 --> 08:39.291
we never would have
found the treasure.

08:39.291 --> 08:41.875
Part of it is his.

08:41.875 --> 08:45.000
Oh. When they see
those rocks,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.458
they'll never
speak to me again.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.875
Oh, my.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.458
There's no way
I can stay here.

08:52.458 --> 08:55.583
Not with them
not liking me.

08:55.583 --> 08:58.875
The only thing left
for me to do,

08:58.875 --> 09:00.250
is move away.

09:07.291 --> 09:09.875
- Tigger: Rabbit!
- Oh, my.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.708
They're coming.
Oh, no!

09:12.708 --> 09:14.708
Tigger: Oh, Rabbit.

09:14.708 --> 09:17.250
Pooh: We're going to
open the treasure, Rabbit.

09:17.250 --> 09:20.625
Rabbit: Oh, no.
I-- I don't want
any part of it.

09:20.625 --> 09:23.208
He doesn't want
any part of it.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.416
What an unselfish guy.

09:26.416 --> 09:28.416
No, no.
Please, no.

09:31.416 --> 09:33.333
Ah, don't worry.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.333
One push of this thingy,

09:35.333 --> 09:38.250
and the whole thing
goes kabingy.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.875
Ahem. Ten, nine, eight,

09:40.875 --> 09:42.583
blast off.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.083
No!
Don't look.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.875
It's-- It's not
the right chest.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.708
That Uncle Long John,
he was such a kidder.

09:53.708 --> 09:56.958
Probably put the treasure
in some other chest.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.458
Yes, uh--
He, uh--

09:58.458 --> 10:00.708
Oh, he-- he forgot to put
a treasure in it.

10:00.708 --> 10:02.500
Buried an empty chest.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.583
Rabbit,
do you see that?

10:05.583 --> 10:08.083
All right.
I confess.

10:08.083 --> 10:11.708
It was me.
I put the rocks in there.

10:11.708 --> 10:13.583
I wanted to
teach you a lesson

10:13.583 --> 10:15.875
for tearing up
my garden.

10:15.875 --> 10:17.583
There never was
a treasure.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.750
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.458
Oh, my goodness.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.708
Wonderful.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.833
Stupendous!

10:26.833 --> 10:28.875
Fantastical.

10:28.875 --> 10:31.416
This is exactly what
I've been looking for

10:31.416 --> 10:34.458
to stop my chair
from wobbling.

10:34.458 --> 10:37.125
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
What a great nut cracker.

10:37.125 --> 10:41.583
Just what I need to
prop up my winch bolts.

10:41.583 --> 10:45.083
Hmm, I didn't think
they made 'em
this size anymore.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.458
Oh, it's every treasure
we ever dreamed of

10:47.458 --> 10:49.291
right here
in this chest.

10:49.291 --> 10:51.458
But, th--
they're only--

10:51.458 --> 10:53.458
And this is your share,
bunny boy.

10:53.458 --> 10:55.833
Uh, but, uh--
but--

10:55.833 --> 10:58.125
Now, that's all right.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.625
Although it is a very rare
and valuable doorstop, um--

11:01.625 --> 11:03.708
Yeah,
probably belonged to

11:03.708 --> 11:06.000
your great, great,
great uncle Long John.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.500
Why, uh,
I-- I-- I hardly know
what to say.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.708
- Uh, I--
- But we do.

11:12.708 --> 11:14.000
Thank you, Rabbit,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.208
for helping us find
this treasure.

11:16.208 --> 11:20.375
And-- and thank you all

11:20.375 --> 11:24.000
for this rare and
valuable doorstop.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.875
Ah-harrr.

11:25.875 --> 11:29.333
You found me buried rocks,
did ya?

11:29.333 --> 11:31.833
All: Ghost!

11:49.000 --> 11:52.416
Empty.
All empty.

11:52.416 --> 11:55.708
Honey jars are only good
for so many smackerels

11:55.708 --> 11:58.583
before they're all
smackereled out.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.708
Goodbye, dear friend.

12:00.708 --> 12:03.708
I hope you like
your new home

12:03.708 --> 12:04.833
at the dump.

12:04.833 --> 12:06.583
Hiya, buddy bear!

12:06.583 --> 12:08.208
Uh, whatcha doin'?

12:08.208 --> 12:10.000
Packing up my
old honey jars.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.458
Pooh, packin' up?

12:11.458 --> 12:15.083
You see,
I'll be leaving soon
to go to the--

12:15.083 --> 12:17.333
Leavin'?

12:17.333 --> 12:19.250
Pooh? Pooh?
Where'd you go?

12:19.250 --> 12:20.375
Where'd you go?

12:20.375 --> 12:22.000
He's gone.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I gotta tell the others.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.875
Oops. Excuse me.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.875
Oh, Pooh boy.
Not gone yet.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.458
Don't do nothin'
'til I do nothin'.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.750
How very odd.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.625
I wonder if it was
something I said.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.625
Hey, donkey boy.
Did you hear?

12:38.625 --> 12:40.750
Buddy bear's
movin' away.

12:40.750 --> 12:44.708
Worst news I've heard
since I lost my house.

12:44.708 --> 12:48.208
Which was about
two seconds ago.

12:48.208 --> 12:49.958
Piglet: Moving away?

12:49.958 --> 12:51.875
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

12:51.875 --> 12:55.750
I miss him already.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.708
Pull yourself together,
Piglet.

12:57.708 --> 12:59.875
He ain't gone yet.

12:59.875 --> 13:01.708
Oh, my.
Oh, dear.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.458
Pooh's moving away.

13:03.458 --> 13:05.291
We must do something.

13:05.291 --> 13:07.750
I got a terrifical idea,
long ears.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.291
How about we throw
buddy bear

13:09.291 --> 13:11.166
a surprise goin' away party?

13:11.166 --> 13:14.708
Maybe, but I have
a better idea, Tigger.

13:14.708 --> 13:17.875
How about you get off me!

13:17.875 --> 13:20.125
- Everybody, shh.
- Be quiet.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.458
- All: Surprise!
- Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

13:25.458 --> 13:26.958
Surprise!

13:26.958 --> 13:30.708
Exactly whom
are we surprising?

13:30.708 --> 13:32.416
Oh, why, you, Pooh.

13:32.416 --> 13:35.625
It's your surprise
going away party.

13:35.625 --> 13:36.833
See?

13:36.833 --> 13:38.958
Pooh: I am surprised.

13:38.958 --> 13:42.083
Why, I didn't even know
I was going away.

13:42.083 --> 13:45.000
Yeah, didn't you
read the signs?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.333
Uh, "goodbye."

13:46.333 --> 13:47.833
Uh, "so long."

13:47.833 --> 13:49.875
"We'll miss you."

13:49.875 --> 13:54.458
Uh, Pooh, we even have
going away presents for you.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.125
A jar of honey!

13:57.125 --> 13:59.875
It's just what I
always wanted, Piglet.

13:59.875 --> 14:02.125
How did you know?

14:02.125 --> 14:04.708
Here you go,
buddy bear.

14:04.708 --> 14:06.875
Oh, thank you,
Tigger.

14:06.875 --> 14:09.291
Oh, thank you,
Eeyore.

14:09.291 --> 14:13.750
It's something sweet,
sticky and golden.

14:15.166 --> 14:19.000
So, Rabbit, what present
do you have for me?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.625
Well, uh, um, uh--

14:21.625 --> 14:23.958
Look, a jagular.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.375
Hey, I don't see
no jagular.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.875
Well, um, it was there
yesterday.

14:32.875 --> 14:35.250
Ooh, that was
a close call.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.333
Here you go, Pooh.
Happy going away.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.583
Thank you, everyone.

14:40.583 --> 14:44.208
This is the best
going away party
I've ever had.

14:44.208 --> 14:45.875
Actually,

14:45.875 --> 14:49.083
it's the only
going away party
I've ever had.

14:50.625 --> 14:54.166
We're happy we
made you happy, Pooh.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.708
If I knew you cared
so much about me,

14:56.708 --> 14:59.875
I would have moved away
years ago.

14:59.875 --> 15:03.000
That's the most
nicest thing I ever heard.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.875
I'm gonna miss you, Pooh.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.375
I can hardly believe
you won't be with us.

15:11.583 --> 15:13.125
I know, Piglet.

15:13.125 --> 15:16.125
I can hardly
believe it myself.

15:16.125 --> 15:18.416
Please don't make this
any more difficult

15:18.416 --> 15:20.708
than it already is.

15:20.708 --> 15:24.000
We wouldn't want to
disappoint our friends
by staying

15:24.000 --> 15:27.416
after the wonderful
going away party
they gave us.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.250
It's not so bad.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.250
We only have to
go away long enough

15:34.250 --> 15:35.416
to have gone away.

15:35.416 --> 15:38.875
Then we'll un-go away.

15:38.875 --> 15:41.458
And our friends will be
so happy to see us,

15:41.458 --> 15:44.958
they'll probably throw
a coming home party.

15:44.958 --> 15:47.708
This looks like a nice spot
to have gone away to.

15:47.708 --> 15:49.875
Now, all I have to do
is wait.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.750
There.
That should be
long enough.

15:53.750 --> 15:58.166
I wouldn't want my friends
to forget me entirely.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.166
I just hope I remember
what they look like

16:00.166 --> 16:01.458
after all this time.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.875
Hello, Pooh.
Back so soon?

16:07.875 --> 16:09.500
You look familiar.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.583
Guess I'm pretty easy
to forget.

16:12.583 --> 16:14.875
Name's Eeyore.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.250
Of course.

16:16.250 --> 16:18.000
I'd never forget a tail.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.583
That's funny.

16:19.583 --> 16:22.250
This looks
very much like...

16:22.250 --> 16:23.625
a Pooh Bear's house.

16:23.625 --> 16:26.083
Nope. Couldn't be.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.000
It's got an Eeyore in it.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.250
See?

16:29.250 --> 16:30.583
Pooh: Oh, bother.

16:30.583 --> 16:33.958
I knew I shouldn't have
gone away so long.

16:33.958 --> 16:36.375
Goin' so soon?

16:36.375 --> 16:39.333
I wouldn't want to
overstay my welcome.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.625
Hello.
Do you remember me?

16:47.625 --> 16:50.291
- I'm--
- Pooh. I'm so happy
to see you.

16:50.291 --> 16:53.000
Uh, what are you doing
back so soon?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
It's a long story,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
and even longer
when I tell it,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.458
but at the moment,
I'm without a home.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.833
Then I insist
you stay with me.

17:02.833 --> 17:04.958
Why, thank you, Piglet.

17:04.958 --> 17:07.875
I promise you
won't even know
I'm around.

17:14.875 --> 17:18.458
Pooh, uh, do you think
you'll be done
with dinner shortly?

17:18.458 --> 17:21.166
Uh, pretty soon it'll be
time for breakfast.

17:21.166 --> 17:23.000
Breakfast.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.208
That's one of my
seven favorite meals
of the day.

17:26.208 --> 17:27.583
Oh, bother.

17:27.583 --> 17:30.166
Out of honey again.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.583
Well, perhaps
you're right, Piglet.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.500
Maybe it is time for bed.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.416
Goodnight, Piglet.

17:42.416 --> 17:44.875
-

17:45.833 --> 17:48.833
Oh, no.

17:50.583 --> 17:53.708
Oh, not my house.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.166
- Oh, d-d-d-dear.

17:57.166 --> 17:58.625
What's that?

18:17.583 --> 18:19.708
Oh, at last.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.708
Good morning,
Piglet.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.708
Did you sleep well?

18:30.708 --> 18:32.250
Poor Piglet.

18:32.250 --> 18:34.291
He must be having
one of those nightmares

18:34.291 --> 18:36.000
you get when
you're awake.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.458
Uh, Pooh,
you really don't
have to do that.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.583
I know, Piglet.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.875
But I want to do something
to show my appreciation.

18:50.625 --> 18:52.958
Pooh, I really enjoy
having you here,

18:52.958 --> 18:54.875
- but--
-

18:56.875 --> 19:00.625
But don't you think
you'd be happier
in your own place?

19:00.625 --> 19:02.583
Um, maybe you should
talk to Eeyore,

19:02.583 --> 19:04.250
and ask him to leave.

19:04.250 --> 19:06.583
Oh, I couldn't do that.

19:06.583 --> 19:09.750
It would probably be best
if I just lived with you.

19:09.750 --> 19:10.875
Forever.

19:10.875 --> 19:11.958
Yike!

19:14.583 --> 19:16.625
What I mean is, uh,

19:16.625 --> 19:18.250
it is your home.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.291
You need to, uh...

19:20.291 --> 19:22.166
stand up for yourself,
Pooh.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.291
Now, just practice saying,

19:24.291 --> 19:26.000
"This is m-m-my home.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.708
"I want you to
m-m-move out."

19:28.708 --> 19:31.208
This is m-my home.

19:31.208 --> 19:34.583
I want you to m-move out.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.500
This is my home.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.833
I want you to move out.

19:41.458 --> 19:44.000
This is my home.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.291
I want you to move out.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.833
Piglet, I think I have it.

19:49.833 --> 19:52.000
Did you call, Pooh?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.625
This is my home.

19:54.625 --> 19:57.375
I want you to move out.

19:57.375 --> 19:59.875
But I--

19:59.875 --> 20:02.500
All right, Pooh.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.375
I'll leave.

20:05.375 --> 20:08.416
Good--
G-goodbye, Pooh.

20:08.416 --> 20:11.250
Piglet.
Where are you going?

20:11.250 --> 20:14.250
Well, you told me to leave.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.083
Oh, Piglet.

20:16.083 --> 20:19.375
I was only practicing
what you told me to say.

20:19.375 --> 20:20.875
You know, Pooh,

20:20.875 --> 20:23.250
you're very convincing.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.458
Thank you, Piglet.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.833
But I'm afraid I'm
too convincing.

20:27.833 --> 20:30.000
I can't ask Eeyore
to leave.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.083
Then what are you
going to do?

20:33.083 --> 20:36.708
The only thing
I can do, Piglet.

20:36.708 --> 20:40.083
Give Eeyore
a house warming party.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.375
Rabbit: Shh.
Be quiet.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.708
Piglet: That's my foot.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.250
I bet old donkey boy
will be surprised

20:46.250 --> 20:48.166
when he sees the party
we're tossing him.

20:48.166 --> 20:51.625
- Can hardly
contain myself.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.125
Sorry to disappoint you,

20:54.125 --> 20:55.833
but it's only me,

20:55.833 --> 20:57.000
donkey boy.

20:57.750 --> 21:00.166
Surprise!

21:00.166 --> 21:01.250
I think it's
a little late

21:01.250 --> 21:03.000
on the surprises,
buddy bear.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.291
So long.

21:04.291 --> 21:06.291
Goodbye.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.875
We'll m-miss ya.

21:08.875 --> 21:12.500
Nicest thing anyone's
ever done for me,

21:12.500 --> 21:15.708
throwin' me
a goin' away party.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.875
Should have
expected it, though.

21:17.875 --> 21:20.583
- But it's not a going--
- Don't worry,

21:20.583 --> 21:22.583
I can take a hint.

21:22.583 --> 21:25.208
Ta-ta for now.

21:25.208 --> 21:27.458
Hmm, Piglet, old pal,

21:27.458 --> 21:29.250
maybe I shouldn't have
used the old signs

21:29.250 --> 21:30.458
from Pooh Bear's party.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.333
Hey, Eeyore,
wait a minute!

21:32.333 --> 21:34.375
You got it all wrong!

21:34.375 --> 21:36.333
Oh, my.

21:36.333 --> 21:37.625
A house warming party

21:37.625 --> 21:40.291
with no one to
warm the house with.

21:40.291 --> 21:41.875
And I didn't even
have a chance

21:41.875 --> 21:43.416
to give Eeyore
his present.

21:43.416 --> 21:46.875
Well, come along,
Piglet.

21:46.875 --> 21:51.416
It's time I started to
look for a place of my own
to live in.

21:51.416 --> 21:53.166
You know, Pooh, uh,

21:53.166 --> 21:56.291
since you happen to be
looking for a house,

21:56.291 --> 21:57.625
and there doesn't
seem to be

21:57.625 --> 21:59.458
anyone staying
in this house,

21:59.458 --> 22:02.833
uh, perhaps you could
live here.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.166
You know, Piglet,

22:08.166 --> 22:09.750
you're right.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.583
There's something
about this house

22:11.583 --> 22:13.875
that feels very homey.
