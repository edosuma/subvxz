00:01.102 --> 00:03.704
*

00:15.683 --> 00:18.186
A diversion?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.820
Why?

00:21.055 --> 00:22.423
So we can get in.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.891
Yeah, I got that part.

00:23.924 --> 00:26.360
Why?

00:26.394 --> 00:29.563
Remember when we used
to get high, and you'd ask,

00:29.597 --> 00:31.399
every time, "Why is it blue?"

00:31.432 --> 00:33.033
And I would say,
"It's always blue, man."

00:33.067 --> 00:34.168
Y-Yeah, except
that never happened.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.669
That's a fake memory.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.505
I-I didn't meet you
till the hospital.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.039
But you remember it, right?

00:39.073 --> 00:40.941
Fake, real, you remember it!

00:40.974 --> 00:43.177
So it happened.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.213
Are you you at all?

00:45.246 --> 00:48.449
Lenny from the-the hospital,
the corn flake girl?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.851
Who couldn't stand
the word "nipples"?

00:50.884 --> 00:53.621
Or is this just a... a mask?

00:53.654 --> 00:55.856
Does it matter?

00:55.889 --> 00:58.259
Bodies and minds, humanity.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.095
Nobody has ever asked a puma
its opinion.

01:01.129 --> 01:04.198
Or a stalk of asparagus
how it feels.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.701
My associate is who she needs
to be at this moment.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.274
Look, all I know
is she said to help you--

01:13.307 --> 01:15.909
Syd-- and I love her,
I trust her,

01:15.943 --> 01:19.313
so... I-I will.

01:19.347 --> 01:21.749
Just, no more lies.
If we're gonna do this,

01:21.782 --> 01:24.618
if I'm gonna help you
find your body,

01:24.652 --> 01:26.620
you're gonna give me back
my friends,

01:26.654 --> 01:29.223
and we're gonna do whatever
she-- Syd, future Syd--

01:29.257 --> 01:32.260
whatever she says.

01:32.293 --> 01:36.797
But let me be ultra clear:
nobody gets hurt.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.035
You got it?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.756
OLIVER:
He agreed.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.193
We go tonight.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.180
OLIVER 2:
Don't worry.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.881
We'll find it.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.591
*

02:57.945 --> 02:59.947
*

03:17.598 --> 03:19.600
*

03:49.330 --> 03:52.900
:
When I spoke to the boss...

03:52.933 --> 03:54.535
Fukyama.

03:54.568 --> 03:59.172
He said the plan was to kill
Oliver when we find him.

04:05.946 --> 04:09.950
Let's make sure
we find him first.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.254
DAVID:
Is he-- sh-she...

04:14.288 --> 04:15.556
are they...

04:15.589 --> 04:16.990
I don't know what to call them.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.593
We call them Vermillion.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.095
DAVID:
Are they mutants?

04:22.129 --> 04:24.732
Androids, I think.

04:24.765 --> 04:28.469
Synthetic, artificial.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.506
I'll be honest.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.108
They made me nervous at first.

04:35.142 --> 04:38.479
But now I find them...

04:38.512 --> 04:39.680
soothing.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.682
They've got no memories for me.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.518
Just data.

04:44.552 --> 04:47.755
How many are there?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.790
No one knows.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.661
All right, stop the truck!

04:53.694 --> 04:55.295
SYD:
Why?

04:56.897 --> 04:58.866
We're here.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.348
VERMILLION 1:
Lead us.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.058
PTONOMY:
What is that?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.531
Syd.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.401
VERMILLION 2: Chance the object
is explosive in nature...

05:33.434 --> 05:35.869
VERMILLION 3:
27%.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.435
DAVID:
What's wrong?

06:07.468 --> 06:08.936
SYD:
Nothing.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.370
Just your asshole parasite

06:10.404 --> 06:12.406
messing with my head.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.943
PTONOMY:
Stay alert.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.077
This feels like a trap.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.178
No, they're gone.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.246
VERMILLION 2:
An error?

06:19.279 --> 06:20.714
DAVID:
Trick.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.717
He knew I was looking,
showed me this spot,

06:23.751 --> 06:25.619
-and then left.
-PTONOMY: So, if Oliver's

06:25.653 --> 06:28.456
not here, where is he?

06:29.757 --> 06:31.959
* Would you *

06:31.992 --> 06:34.795
* Like to swing on a star *

06:34.828 --> 06:36.530
* Whoa, ho, ho *

06:36.564 --> 06:38.466
* Carry moonbeams home *

06:38.499 --> 06:39.467
* In a jar *

06:39.500 --> 06:40.601
* Whoa, ho, ho *

06:40.634 --> 06:42.302
* And be better off *

06:42.335 --> 06:44.472
-* Than you are *
-* Oh, ho, ho *

06:46.139 --> 06:48.476
* Or would you rather
be a pig? *

06:48.509 --> 06:50.243
Bang.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.617
* A-doo, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo *

06:56.650 --> 06:59.620
* Doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo *

06:59.653 --> 07:01.088
Or would you rather be a fish?

07:01.121 --> 07:04.458
* Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo *

07:05.493 --> 07:07.495
Stop, stop, don't.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.202
Run away.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.510
* Doo, doo-doo, doo, doo,
doo-doo. *

07:26.514 --> 07:29.449
I-It's advanced, but...

07:29.483 --> 07:31.284
but not Shi'ar.

07:31.318 --> 07:34.121
That was my first guess,
as well.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.289
No. I-I can't shake the feeling

07:36.323 --> 07:39.527
that somehow I constructed it,
this-this orb.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.264
Believe me,
I know how that sounds, yes.

07:48.135 --> 07:51.171
OLIVER: * A-doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo. *

08:43.090 --> 08:47.728
OLIVER: * A-doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo. *

08:54.968 --> 08:57.805
Oliver.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.910
It's me. Cary.

09:08.281 --> 09:11.518
Can you hear me in there?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.787
:
Can you hear me in here?

09:13.821 --> 09:15.455
Oh!

09:20.628 --> 09:22.830
Let's dance, asshole.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.601
Kerry?

09:27.635 --> 09:30.370
I'm scared.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.630
Hey, you.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.663
Where is he?

10:29.697 --> 10:31.699
Cary.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.206
Hey. Are you okay?

10:39.239 --> 10:40.841
Yeah, I'm-I'm okay.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.510
Third floor's secure. Report.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.381
Come on.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.451
Um...

10:55.088 --> 10:56.489
Are they still here?

10:56.523 --> 10:58.525
Uh...

11:00.828 --> 11:03.396
No, they're, they're gone.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.866
-Okay, come on.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.907
Kerry?

11:13.941 --> 11:15.943
What's wrong?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.354
Whoa.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.035
*

11:54.214 --> 11:55.682
OLIVER:
Melanie.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.750
Is he here?

11:56.784 --> 11:58.919
The monk of the Mi

11:58.952 --> 12:00.954
Have you seen him?

12:03.290 --> 12:05.092
Is he here?

12:05.125 --> 12:08.028
At Division 3?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.898
The monk of the Mi

12:13.934 --> 12:15.468
MELANIE:
He was searching for a monk.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.371
A member of the Mi-Go order.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.108
Oliver believes
he's hiding here.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.410
Impossible.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.778
Why?

12:24.812 --> 12:25.879
VERMILLION 3:
Many years ago,

12:25.913 --> 12:27.114
the Mi-Go monks were wiped out

12:27.147 --> 12:28.715
by The Miser Sunday.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.550
Miser who?

12:30.583 --> 12:33.420
I believe it was
before your time.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.889
But you've heard the same rumors
I have.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.224
When Amahl Farouk was defeated,

12:37.257 --> 12:38.725
his mind was separated
from his body.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.960
MELANIE: And his body
was then hidden away

12:39.993 --> 12:42.595
with the monks.

12:42.629 --> 12:45.398
So, if Farouk was looking
for his body...

12:45.432 --> 12:48.001
A Mi-Go monk would know
its location.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.370
Right.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.445
So, is the monk here or not?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.914
We will put this
in simple terms.

13:00.948 --> 13:04.584
David Haller, there's a 63%
chance you've been lying to us.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.154
Sixty

13:07.187 --> 13:08.822
MELANIE:
Lie exactly about what?

13:08.856 --> 13:11.124
Everything.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.625
That's a lot.

13:12.659 --> 13:13.760
VERMILLION 1:
You led us from the building

13:13.793 --> 13:15.362
while the Shadow King broke in.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.030
A diversion?

13:17.064 --> 13:18.298
Working in conjunction
with Farouk.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.133
-Conspiring.
-SYD: He told you.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.702
Farouk tricked us
out of the building.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.704
That's what he does.
Trick people.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.106
-Syd...
-No.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.308
Tell them.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.713
I'd be careful
who you blame right now.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.684
Maybe don't piss off
our only hope

13:37.717 --> 13:41.054
of killing the monster.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.872
DAVID : Nobody...
nobody... nobody gets hurt.

14:03.610 --> 14:07.847
Nobody... nobody...
nobody gets hurt.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.275
KERRY:
Ow. That was too loud.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.545
Is that what I sound like?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.750
-CARY: I'm scared.
-I know. I'm scared, too.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.053
DAVID:
Kerry?

14:46.086 --> 14:49.189
Are you okay?

14:49.222 --> 14:52.425
Yeah. Try getting flipped inside
out and see how you like it.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.595
You want something?

14:55.628 --> 14:58.131
I need more help finding Farouk.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.467
DAVID 1:
Liar.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.036
Some modifications to the tank.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.138
Do I look like the fix

15:05.172 --> 15:06.573
Or any guy?

15:06.606 --> 15:07.941
I'm the X-chromosome ass kicker.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.809
Or maybe you missed the part

15:09.842 --> 15:11.644
where there was an arm
sticking out of my stomach.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.947
-I just...
-DAVID 1: Tell her the truth.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.949
I wouldn't ask unless...

15:15.983 --> 15:17.951
-It's important.
-DAVID 1: Is that... did you
just give her a nickname?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.454
The sooner we find Farouk,

15:21.488 --> 15:22.922
the sooner we can get you guys,

15:22.956 --> 15:25.425
you know, back the way you were.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.995
He said that made sense.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.097
-Cary.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.098
In my head.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.832
Right.

15:32.865 --> 15:35.235
Well, I was thinking,
if you modify the tank,

15:35.268 --> 15:38.171
if there was some way
I could see past the...

15:38.205 --> 15:40.640
right now 'cause his
thoughts are shielded.

15:40.673 --> 15:41.674
He's hiding from me.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.977
But if I could find a way

15:44.011 --> 15:48.615
outside of space and time,
see the past

15:48.648 --> 15:51.851
where he's been or maybe the
future, where he's gonna be...

15:51.884 --> 15:54.054
Multidimensional perception.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.991
I just... I need
to get ahead of him.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.761
Cary said it might be
too dangerous

16:01.794 --> 16:03.363
and that you could explode.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.969
Well...

16:12.339 --> 16:17.610
I trust you-- him-- so...

16:17.644 --> 16:20.947
so let's try to avoid that.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.560
Which one?

16:38.831 --> 16:40.033
Sorry.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.305
Yellow 40.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.707
Speak up.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.942
Oh...

16:58.718 --> 17:01.088
Okay, which switch?

17:01.121 --> 17:03.323
The one with the lightning bolt.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.558
It's his funeral.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.508
Okay.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.244
Cary says, "Hang on."

17:33.320 --> 17:35.088
More!

17:35.122 --> 17:38.158
More...!

17:59.846 --> 18:03.082
*

18:30.177 --> 18:32.612
Hello?

19:05.578 --> 19:07.747
Syd.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.218
It worked.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.858
You... are you real?

19:18.891 --> 19:21.561
Possible. Not possible.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.463
To be here, for you to be here.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.199
DAVID:
Well, I'm here. We're here.

19:26.233 --> 19:30.203
I had to see you again...

19:30.237 --> 19:33.406
to understand.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.708
They killed people.

19:35.742 --> 19:38.345
I-I let them. I helped them

19:38.378 --> 19:40.380
because you said...

19:45.252 --> 19:47.254
What?

19:49.522 --> 19:54.827
I never thought
I'd see you again like this.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.096
What, am I dead in the future?

19:59.966 --> 20:02.602
Wait, am I dead?

20:03.903 --> 20:07.240
It's complicated.

20:07.274 --> 20:10.343
Good complicated?

20:10.377 --> 20:12.011
-Oh!

20:12.044 --> 20:15.114
Ow!

20:16.749 --> 20:18.718
Wha

20:18.751 --> 20:21.854
Ah, I tried to read your mind.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.357
I don't think that works
because I'm from the...

20:24.391 --> 20:25.892
Future. Yeah, I got that.

20:25.925 --> 20:29.396
Look, I don't know
what happens to me, to us,

20:29.429 --> 20:34.301
what disaster or monster, but...

20:34.334 --> 20:38.705
you came to me because of love.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.741
What we have...

20:44.143 --> 20:47.213
You trust me.

20:47.246 --> 20:51.284
And I trust you.

20:51.318 --> 20:54.621
But what you're asking...

20:54.654 --> 20:59.959
to help this thing,
I got to know why.

21:10.770 --> 21:15.074
It started like
any other idea...

21:15.107 --> 21:17.477
as an egg.

21:19.612 --> 21:23.416
And then the few of us
who are left went into hiding.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.453
But we don't have long.
It's coming.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.188
DAVID:
What's coming?

21:29.221 --> 21:32.492
-No, he's dead in my timeline.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.960
You killed him.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.830
When?

21:37.864 --> 21:40.299
About a week from now.
In the desert.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.502
You bashed his brains in.

21:42.535 --> 21:45.004
Huh.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.439
Well, then, who...?

21:46.473 --> 21:49.308
It doesn't matter.

21:49.342 --> 21:52.111
We need him when things turn.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.646
He killed...

21:53.680 --> 21:56.215
He killed a few.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.818
This thing kills everyone.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.587
Kills every-everyone.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.069
You're so...

22:17.103 --> 22:19.071
different.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.676
Time does that to people.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.148
Apparently.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.317
You're...

22:31.350 --> 22:33.486
how you were.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.489
In the past, before.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.925
Sweet.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.099
Can I see you again?

22:52.539 --> 22:55.508
You brought me.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.544
It isn't my decision.

22:57.577 --> 23:01.748
Well, if it was your decision,
would you like to see me again?

23:01.781 --> 23:04.617
Like this?

23:45.424 --> 23:48.127
NARRATOR:
A wise man once said,

23:48.160 --> 23:53.833
"Reality is that which,
when you stop believing in it,

23:53.866 --> 23:56.335
doesn't go away."

23:58.705 --> 24:00.573
For the tick,

24:00.607 --> 24:04.777
reality is a product of
temperature and butyric acid.

24:04.811 --> 24:08.280
Its perception of the world
is its reality.

24:10.650 --> 24:14.253
The bloodhound has
200 million scent receptors.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.822
Its perception of the world

24:15.855 --> 24:18.625
is based fundamentally
on smell.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.662
A dog doesn't reason.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.831
A tick never thinks
about the universe

24:24.864 --> 24:27.500
in any way separate from
its biological interactions

24:27.534 --> 24:30.169
with the universe.

24:32.572 --> 24:35.675
Human beings,
on the other hand...

24:38.077 --> 24:40.847
Imagine a boy.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.616
From a young age,
he is taught wrong.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.518
This color is called red.

24:45.552 --> 24:48.387
This one is green.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.623
Red.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.659
Green.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.395
NARRATOR: Human beings
are the only animal

24:56.428 --> 24:58.865
that forms ideas
about their world.

24:58.898 --> 25:03.536
We perceive it not through our
bodies but through our minds.

25:03.570 --> 25:08.140
Remember, red means stop,
green means go.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.743
NARRATOR:
We must agree on what is real.

25:21.788 --> 25:25.892
Because of this,
we are the only animal on Earth

25:25.925 --> 25:28.360
that goes mad.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.842
CLARK:
Hi. You have a minute?

25:42.875 --> 25:44.510
DAVID: Actually, I was...
I was just...

25:44.543 --> 25:46.646
CLARK:
Oh, it'll only take a second.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.524
I feel like this is our spot.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.628
Are you... 'Cause I got...

26:01.661 --> 26:03.195
I was going in the tank to...

26:03.229 --> 26:04.731
Oh, you were just in there,
I thought.

26:04.764 --> 26:07.767
Some modifications to get
outside space-time.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.636
Isn't that what you told Kerry?

26:09.669 --> 26:13.906
Over my head, the science,
but I got to ask

26:13.940 --> 26:15.574
What?

26:15.608 --> 26:18.811
That line you gave about seeing
where Farouk was gonna be--

26:18.845 --> 26:20.713
or... where he was.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.581
-I'm...
-No, of course we know
where he was.

26:22.615 --> 26:23.750
He was here.
He killed 11 of my men,

26:23.783 --> 26:25.051
turned one into a pig,

26:25.084 --> 26:28.054
scared the shit
out of a bunch of kids.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.456
I feel like, in order
to answer that question,

26:30.489 --> 26:32.324
I need to explain
how telepathy works.

26:32.358 --> 26:35.962
Did you find him?
Yes or no?

26:44.603 --> 26:46.639
He hides.

26:46.673 --> 26:49.308
I used to think it was just
inside Oliver's mind,

26:49.341 --> 26:51.778
but then I realized he keeps
other minds in there with him.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.180
Lenny. Maybe others.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.648
And when he senses me looking,
he brings one forward

26:55.682 --> 26:57.316
and hides inside of it.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.351
So, uh, what you're saying is,
you're useless.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.188
Or maybe you're...

27:02.221 --> 27:03.656
Maybe I'm what?

27:03.690 --> 27:05.858
Are you familiar with the term
"collusion"?

27:07.727 --> 27:09.195
You're starting to make me mad.

27:09.228 --> 27:10.596
Oh, are you gonna put more

27:10.629 --> 27:12.364
office supplies in my face?

27:12.398 --> 27:14.100
Burn me alive?

27:14.133 --> 27:16.703
That's...

27:16.736 --> 27:17.870
You were the bad guy.

27:17.904 --> 27:18.938
Yeah, that's funny.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.306
I thought you were the bad guy.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.108
CLARK:
I know you're lying.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.976
I think you're helping him,
but I don't know why.

27:24.010 --> 27:27.279
DAVID: And I think your job
is to suspect everyone,

27:27.313 --> 27:29.515
and that makes everyone
a suspect.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.191
Why'd you take us to the desert?

27:39.225 --> 27:41.894
I told you, I saw him there.

27:41.928 --> 27:46.165
Amahl Farouk.
The Shadow King.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.200
Yeah, but I-I thought you didn't
know what he looked like.

27:48.234 --> 27:52.638
Oliver. He's in Oliver.
That's who I saw.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.673
That's not what you said.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.050
Just let me do my job.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.687
This'll all be over soon enough.

28:08.721 --> 28:12.892
Okay. But just remember...

28:12.925 --> 28:16.062
:
we see everything.

28:19.732 --> 28:22.534
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

28:49.829 --> 28:51.397
DAVID:
Be strong.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.200
Tell him we're in control.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.635
Nobody else gets hurt.

29:06.813 --> 29:10.983
Oliver, Farouk.
We need to talk.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.963
*

30:28.060 --> 30:30.262
Why so sad, my dear?

30:34.600 --> 30:36.936
Where's Oliver?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.708
Oh, wait, are you...

30:42.741 --> 30:44.944
Monsieur Amahl Farouk.

30:47.713 --> 30:48.948
You heard that?

31:03.896 --> 31:05.864
It's a muscle, my dear.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.833
The big gray meat.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.203
You got to work it out,
get it stronger.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.110
Learn this stuff.

31:21.213 --> 31:25.584
You decide what is real
and what is not.

31:25.617 --> 31:28.787
You. Your will.

31:33.225 --> 31:36.062
What is the phrase? Um...

31:37.096 --> 31:40.066
The kiddie table.

31:40.099 --> 31:43.469
You got to get up
from the kiddie table.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.871
Come and sit with the big boys.

31:45.904 --> 31:49.808
It's all about respect, my man.

31:49.841 --> 31:52.711
You and I, we are

31:52.744 --> 31:55.281
les dieux.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.416
Gods.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.885
What did John Lennon say?

31:59.918 --> 32:03.922
Bigger than Jesus.

32:03.956 --> 32:09.295
Look at you, such a sad face.

32:09.328 --> 32:12.164
Why you got such a sad face?

32:14.600 --> 32:18.437
You read my mind.
You tell me.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.306
Oh...

32:22.441 --> 32:26.178
You feel boo-hoo. Used.

32:28.981 --> 32:32.318
Now we need to figure out
if you're mad at me

32:32.351 --> 32:35.054
or yourself.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.896
Ah...

33:04.816 --> 33:07.519
Yeah.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.855
*

33:09.888 --> 33:11.890
Ah.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.292
Le sport.

33:16.095 --> 33:20.032
Physical.
Very physical.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.072
What is the word?
Uh...

33:26.105 --> 33:28.507
homoerotic.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.476
-Shut up.

33:36.715 --> 33:39.151
Oh, you're strong.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.852
Very strong.

33:47.126 --> 33:51.463
FAROUK: But you're playing
the wrong game.

34:01.407 --> 34:04.210
Shall we continue?

34:29.000 --> 34:33.205
I told her I'd help you.
And I will.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.941
But no more violence.

34:40.946 --> 34:42.914
Or what?

34:42.948 --> 34:45.317
More violence

34:48.287 --> 34:49.988
I don't trust you.

34:50.021 --> 34:51.790
I don't need you to trust me,

34:51.823 --> 34:53.992
but you will respect me.

34:54.025 --> 34:56.862
I'm not some cockroach that you
can step on with a boot.

35:02.268 --> 35:07.173
If you help me to find my body,
I will be in your debt.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.941
And where I come from,

35:09.975 --> 35:13.245
debt is something
that must be honored.

35:13.279 --> 35:15.181
No more killing.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.151
Promise.

35:28.026 --> 35:31.963
Fine. I promise.

35:49.315 --> 35:52.284
I'll find your monk...

35:52.318 --> 35:54.019
if he's at Division 3.

35:54.052 --> 35:56.555
Wait for my signal.

36:22.214 --> 36:26.184
LENNY:
You know, I was thinking...

36:26.218 --> 36:29.721
now that you're,
uh, out of the closet,

36:29.755 --> 36:32.924
you and the kid talking again,
face-to-face,

36:32.958 --> 36:36.895
that maybe I could go.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.064
Go where?

36:41.367 --> 36:44.035
You know.

36:44.069 --> 36:46.738
Back to my life!

36:46.772 --> 36:48.440
Right?

36:52.478 --> 36:55.547
But you're dead, your body.

36:56.882 --> 37:00.552
But I was thinking maybe...

37:00.586 --> 37:03.889
you could make me a new one.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.924
Right? Come on.

37:05.957 --> 37:10.396
You'd be the ultimate badass.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.768
All I'm saying is, you got
what you wanted out of me, man.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.203
Right?

37:18.236 --> 37:21.072
Your friendly
neighborhood junkie.

37:21.106 --> 37:24.510
You popped me like a tick,
stole my face.

37:25.911 --> 37:28.046
And I'm not complaining.
I'm not, it was...

37:28.079 --> 37:30.649
it's-it's been
a shit blast, really.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.818
But... you know,
a little boring.

37:32.851 --> 37:35.086
I mean, all-all
that haunted house stuff.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.322
All that...

37:36.355 --> 37:37.489
:
"David, I...

37:37.523 --> 37:38.757
I am your conscience."

37:42.260 --> 37:43.895
:
You know how long it's been

37:43.929 --> 37:45.797
since I got laid, man?

37:47.833 --> 37:51.102
S-So I was thinking, you know,
you

37:51.136 --> 37:53.405
And-and I can just...

37:53.439 --> 37:55.841
I'll just sneak out
the back door.

38:09.555 --> 38:12.157
But I am going, right?

38:12.190 --> 38:14.626
Eventually?

38:22.033 --> 38:25.637
What would you do?

38:25.671 --> 38:27.539
A new life,

38:27.573 --> 38:30.376
new body.

38:35.747 --> 38:39.651
I-I'd live
the living shit out of it.

38:39.685 --> 38:42.521
Then what?

38:44.890 --> 38:46.892
Uh...

38:46.925 --> 38:49.027
Guess I'd die again?

38:53.832 --> 38:56.234
And then what?

39:25.764 --> 39:28.767
Speak up, I can't hear you.

39:30.436 --> 39:32.037
Louder.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.909
No, he couldn't have.

39:37.943 --> 39:41.112
That's not possible.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.714
Uh-- I-I don't know.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.049
Wha...

39:44.082 --> 39:47.519
Look, what do we do?

39:47.553 --> 39:49.020
I...

39:49.054 --> 39:50.556
like, how...?

39:50.589 --> 39:51.757
Think harder, okay?

39:51.790 --> 39:53.959
Like, how do we...?

39:53.992 --> 39:55.927
No.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.564
No, there's got to be
a different way.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.234
Because they'll hear me.

40:04.836 --> 40:09.274
Look, I'm not embarrassed, I...

40:09.307 --> 40:13.479
Yes, I want you to be able
to get out, I-I just...

40:17.516 --> 40:20.586
This better work.

playing over TV)

40:48.013 --> 40:50.482
KERRY:
* Tra, la, la *

40:50.516 --> 40:53.585
* Tra, la, la, la *

40:53.619 --> 40:58.824
CARY AND KERRY: * Tra, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la *

40:58.857 --> 41:00.826
* Tra, la, la *

41:00.859 --> 41:03.762
KERRY:
* Tra, la, la *

41:03.795 --> 41:07.032
-* Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la *
-* Tra, la, ah, la, la, la, la *

41:07.065 --> 41:09.100
* Tra, la, la *

41:11.036 --> 41:13.438
* Tra, la, la. *

41:20.846 --> 41:24.482
There's not much room
to move in there.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.787
Can you fix it?

41:28.820 --> 41:29.955
This?

41:29.988 --> 41:31.690
I'll try.

41:31.723 --> 41:34.325
I-I...

41:34.359 --> 41:36.862
I don't want to be out here
the whole time.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.998
Living life.

41:40.031 --> 41:42.067
Like, the boring stuff,
that was not our choice.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.636
We never had a choice.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.237
And for the time being,

41:46.271 --> 41:50.208
we're gonna have to learn
to exist like this.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.911
What is it

41:52.944 --> 41:55.380
Uh, it's nothing, uh...

42:04.956 --> 42:06.558
MELANIE:
But Oliver had a dream.

42:06.592 --> 42:09.160
He wanted to build a home
for people like him.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.997
You know, with abilities.

42:12.030 --> 42:16.201
And, uh, I didn't have a dream,
so I said sure.

42:17.636 --> 42:18.837
And we built Summerland.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.739
FAROUK:
You and I.

42:20.772 --> 42:24.509
-We are gods.
-His dream became my dream.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.244
What did John Lennon say?

42:26.277 --> 42:29.848
-Bigger than Jesus.
-...so busy keeping
his dream alive

42:29.881 --> 42:31.683
and trying
to get him back that I...

42:31.717 --> 42:36.121
never got around
to having a dream of my own.

42:36.154 --> 42:39.457
And now I'm older,

42:39.490 --> 42:43.061
and, uh, it's over.

42:43.094 --> 42:45.563
I don't get a second chance.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.902
I was wrong, son.

42:55.240 --> 43:00.145
When I told you
that your ability was a gift.

43:00.178 --> 43:01.579
It's not.

43:01.613 --> 43:03.882
It's an obstacle.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.718
An obstacle to what?

43:06.752 --> 43:08.119
Happiness.

43:08.153 --> 43:09.855
Intimacy.

43:11.122 --> 43:13.158
You want my advice?

43:14.592 --> 43:16.594
Leave.

43:17.829 --> 43:20.165
Now.

43:20.198 --> 43:24.670
Take Syd and find a nice,
quiet hilltop somewhere,

43:24.703 --> 43:26.604
settle down.

43:26.638 --> 43:28.740
Look at the clouds.

43:28.774 --> 43:30.175
Live.

43:31.877 --> 43:32.978
But wh-what about...

43:33.011 --> 43:34.312
What?

43:34.345 --> 43:36.347
What about what?

43:37.783 --> 43:39.117
Saving the world?

43:40.351 --> 43:42.854
The world will be just fine.

43:42.888 --> 43:45.991
It always is.

43:46.024 --> 43:50.696
I mean, things might get worse
for a while.

43:50.729 --> 43:53.832
Maybe people will die.

43:53.865 --> 43:59.304
Hmm, we all die eventually.

43:59.337 --> 44:05.010
The real tragedy
is forgetting to live.

44:08.213 --> 44:10.048
Save yourself.

44:12.517 --> 44:14.319
While you still can.

44:29.534 --> 44:30.702
DAVID:
Syd!

44:33.371 --> 44:34.973
Thank God.

44:45.016 --> 44:49.187
Uh... hey.

44:54.425 --> 44:56.427
SYD:
Over here.

45:00.631 --> 45:02.233
Y-You're...

45:04.602 --> 45:06.805
Neat, huh?

45:08.874 --> 45:11.076
Yeah, sure.

45:11.109 --> 45:14.379
Okay.

45:19.417 --> 45:21.452
-Uh...

45:21.486 --> 45:25.190
I'm just feeling a bit...

45:25.223 --> 45:28.760
I'm just-- I'm just questioning
myself, and-and...

45:28.794 --> 45:30.762
I know I promised I wouldn't
tell, but if I tell you,

45:30.796 --> 45:34.232
and you're the one--
it

45:34.265 --> 45:37.702
What are you saying?

45:37.735 --> 45:39.737
I know who took me in the orb.

45:39.771 --> 45:41.239
You lied?

45:41.272 --> 45:42.740
Withheld.

45:42.774 --> 45:44.275
What's the difference?

45:44.309 --> 45:45.811
Look, do you want to know
who took me, or not?

45:45.844 --> 45:46.945
Yes.

45:46.978 --> 45:48.113
It was you.

45:48.146 --> 45:49.114
"Me," what?

45:49.147 --> 45:50.548
In the orb.

45:50.581 --> 45:51.549
Me, the cat?

45:51.582 --> 45:53.451
No. Can you...?

45:53.484 --> 45:54.986
Would-would you...

45:55.020 --> 45:56.754
get-- can you switch back
to your body?

45:56.788 --> 45:58.323
-'Cause I...

46:00.191 --> 46:02.093
It was you.

46:02.127 --> 46:03.328
In the orb.

46:03.361 --> 46:05.663
But not you, you.

46:05.696 --> 46:07.098
Like you are now.

46:07.132 --> 46:09.935
You from the future. Uh...

46:09.968 --> 46:13.504
You told me to help Farouk
find his body.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.908
You sure it was me?

46:16.942 --> 46:18.910
I'm not crazy.

46:18.944 --> 46:20.846
I didn't say that.

46:20.879 --> 46:22.881
You didn't have to.

46:25.616 --> 46:26.784
When?

46:26.818 --> 46:27.986
"When," what?

46:28.019 --> 46:29.187
When in the future?

46:29.220 --> 46:30.455
Tomorrow?

46:30.488 --> 46:32.958
Next week?

46:33.959 --> 46:36.027
A year from now

46:36.061 --> 46:37.462
I-I don't know. "The future."

46:37.495 --> 46:39.130
-The...
-That...

46:41.466 --> 46:42.834
Was I old?

46:42.868 --> 46:45.503
Older.

46:45.536 --> 46:48.773
-Y-You were...
-And I asked you to help Farouk.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.608
Why would I do that?

46:50.641 --> 46:53.244
I, uh, because of the plague?

46:54.980 --> 46:56.447
Why didn't you say anything?

46:56.481 --> 46:59.117
Because I promised you
I wouldn't.

46:59.150 --> 47:02.120
And to keep my promise--
you see, I had to...

47:02.153 --> 47:03.955
I mean...

47:03.989 --> 47:07.625
technically, telling you your
own secret probably is fine,

47:07.658 --> 47:09.961
I I...

47:09.995 --> 47:11.897
I don't know.
I'm still a little shaky

47:11.930 --> 47:13.932
on who I'm supposed to not tell.

47:18.236 --> 47:20.371
The music box.

47:20.405 --> 47:21.839
What about it?

47:21.873 --> 47:23.574
It was mine as a kid.

47:23.608 --> 47:24.976
Did you do that?

47:25.010 --> 47:26.177
Me? No.

47:26.211 --> 47:27.378
That was Farouk.

47:27.412 --> 47:31.182
It was-- I didn't like that.

47:31.216 --> 47:34.886
Seeing it again.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.521
He did that to me.

47:36.554 --> 47:40.358
You told me to help him,
not like him.

47:48.399 --> 47:51.036
Okay.

47:52.904 --> 47:55.040
"Okay," what?

47:55.073 --> 47:59.377
If I said that you should do it,
then you should do it.

47:59.410 --> 48:02.013
Really?

48:02.047 --> 48:04.916
Don't you trust me?

48:04.950 --> 48:06.251
Her

48:06.284 --> 48:08.353
Yeah, but...

48:08.386 --> 48:10.355
Like you said.

48:10.388 --> 48:13.758
Reality's a choice.

48:13.791 --> 48:16.161
How do we start?

48:18.329 --> 48:21.799
We find the monk.

48:21.832 --> 48:23.834
*

48:32.777 --> 48:36.147
*

48:41.752 --> 48:43.754
*

50:59.324 --> 51:00.791
MAN:
Now I get it.
