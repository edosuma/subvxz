09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I love this book and I wanted to share it with you both,

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
but it isn't worth our lives

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
or the damage to library property.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
All right, warrior girl.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Hand over the war plans you're hiding,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
and nobody gets splatted.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Craig isn't any part of your wars.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
He was just trying to protect this!

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
[ All gasp ]

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
But this is just a library book.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
[ Laughter ]

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Just a library book?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
What lies between those covers is a world

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
that cannot be contained by the rules of time,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
where animals talk like you and me,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
a land where spoons are portals -- and spoons.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
You see, what you call a book,

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
I call a doorway to the land of imagination.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It is a pool from which I will be drinking inspiration

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
for the rest of my days!

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
And it's really, really good.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
[ Sniffs ] I couldn't have said it better myself.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I -- I knew you'd like it.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Drop your weapons. There's no big secret here.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Just some complicated fantasy novel.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Solders, let's move out!

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I'm gonna keep this book...

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
as evidence.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Can I just say, I did not see

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Peter Puffin's sacrifice coming at all!

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I never thought anyone could be so selfless.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Oh, my goodness. I totally agree.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
It was literally the best part ever.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
-My head hurt. -For real.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I thought it was the way I was leaning.
