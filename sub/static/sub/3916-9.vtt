00:00.110 --> 00:01.420
Previously on "The Fosters"...

00:01.420 --> 00:03.130
I'm always gonna have feelings for you.

00:03.130 --> 00:04.330
But I don't trust you.

00:04.340 --> 00:07.170
Nothing's fine right now including my marriage.

00:07.180 --> 00:10.210
I don't even know what that little kiss was about. It was nothing.

00:10.210 --> 00:13.760
I remember a young man, African-American, got on the bus,

00:13.760 --> 00:15.990
blood all over his shirt and face.

00:15.990 --> 00:17.320
That's Joe Olsen...

00:17.330 --> 00:19.460
The son of the owner of the S.U.V. that hit the kids.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.150
But didn't you say the guy on the bus was black?

00:21.150 --> 00:24.000
Yeah, but this Joe Olsen shows up in this pharmacy

00:24.000 --> 00:25.540
40 minutes after the accident?

00:25.540 --> 00:27.020
I'm sorry, but that's not coincidence.

00:27.020 --> 00:29.920
Yeah, I got my G.E.D. and I join the army in two weeks.

00:29.920 --> 00:33.630
Congratulation Carmen.That's been your goal for, like, so long.

00:33.630 --> 00:35.010
Brooke and me were in a fight.

00:35.020 --> 00:38.590
And Rita came upstairs. And then she hit me.

00:38.590 --> 00:40.310
- Brooke? - No. Rita.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.550
I never laid a hand on her.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.010
It's true. Rita punched her in the face.

00:46.110 --> 00:47.840
So I just decided I'm gonna wait to join the army

00:47.840 --> 00:49.870
after I graduate high school.

00:49.870 --> 00:51.180
But you got your G.E.D.?

00:51.180 --> 00:52.930
Yeah, if the army didn't work out.

00:52.930 --> 00:55.880
she can probably get a better job with a high school diploma.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.310
You wanna share the other reason?

00:59.670 --> 01:01.140
I guess...

01:01.140 --> 01:05.160
I'm also sorta shaken up about Rita hitting me.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.570
Why are you lying?

01:06.900 --> 01:07.560
I'm not.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.150
Brooke hit you. Why are you covering for her?

01:09.150 --> 01:10.080
Why is she in group?

01:10.080 --> 01:11.340
She's not even part of the program.

01:11.340 --> 01:14.140
Everyone who lives here participates in group.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.310
What's she got on you, Carmen?

01:15.320 --> 01:17.190
You know, I don't appreciate the accusation.

01:17.190 --> 01:18.170
She wasn't talking to you.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.670
Yeah, let her talk.

01:19.670 --> 01:21.880
Why, Carmen? After everything that Rita's done for you.

01:21.880 --> 01:22.770
I don't get it.

01:22.770 --> 01:24.330
You don't have to get it, bitch.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.100
You the bitch.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.030
Hey, hey, hey! Kiara, Brooke,

01:27.030 --> 01:28.470
That's a U.A. for both of you.

01:28.470 --> 01:30.630
Like, I don't even think Carmen would even cover for Brooke.

01:30.630 --> 01:31.690
She hates her.

01:31.690 --> 01:33.340
And what would I have on her, okay?

01:33.340 --> 01:35.240
She's foreman, she's got all her privileges.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.720
She's like the G.U. poster girl.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.340
But I gotta say, the army's gonna be your job.

01:39.340 --> 01:40.940
Why doesn't she want to get the hell out of here?

01:40.940 --> 01:42.620
Yeah, why don't you want to get out of here, Carmen?

01:42.620 --> 01:44.500
Can we just be done with me?

01:44.500 --> 01:46.210
Can't somebody else talk?

01:46.350 --> 01:47.460
Okay.

01:47.850 --> 01:48.920
Dee.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.690
Going home for the weekend.

01:51.050 --> 01:52.750
How are you feeling about that?

01:55.380 --> 01:57.900
So the bus driver lets off a bleeding, agitated guy

01:57.900 --> 01:59.560
in front of a pharmacy.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.510
And a little while later...

02:02.420 --> 02:03.910
in walks Joe Olsen.

02:04.270 --> 02:05.120
So?

02:05.420 --> 02:07.560
So what if this guy is a friend of Joe's?

02:07.560 --> 02:10.199
What if Joe lends his father's car to the guy,

02:10.199 --> 02:11.550
he runs a red light,

02:11.550 --> 02:13.510
hits Ana and the twins in the Volvo,

02:13.510 --> 02:14.970
and takes off?

02:14.970 --> 02:16.730
So he goes down the alley, gets on the bus...

02:16.730 --> 02:18.330
and gets off in front of the pharmacy, calls Joe.

02:18.340 --> 02:20.010
Joe comes and sees that his friend is bleeding,

02:20.010 --> 02:22.360
goes into the pharmacy to get bandages or whatever.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.410
Yeah, but, I mean...

02:23.410 --> 02:24.560
He could have gotten them for himself.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.360
He's got that cut over the eye.

02:25.370 --> 02:26.670
No, no, no. That's not a fresh cut.

02:26.670 --> 02:27.420
That's not a fresh cut.

02:27.420 --> 02:30.340
And what is he doing in Linda Vista 30 minutes after the accident

02:30.340 --> 02:32.250
when he told us that he was at work?

02:32.840 --> 02:35.590
You've got an interesting theory, Stef, but, I mean,

02:35.590 --> 02:37.090
there's no way to I.D. the guy on the bus

02:37.090 --> 02:38.590
or connect him to Olsen.

02:38.590 --> 02:39.460
So...

02:41.780 --> 02:43.000
So what you're saying...

02:43.000 --> 02:44.740
You have an interesting theory.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.370
- Hey, you all set? - Yeah.

02:47.370 --> 02:48.860
We're gonna miss you around here.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.210
I'm gonna miss y'all too.

02:50.210 --> 02:51.950
And thank you for everything y'all did for me.

02:51.950 --> 02:53.710
We were happy to do it, A.J.

02:54.690 --> 02:55.620
You're leaving?

02:55.620 --> 02:58.170
Yeah, Mike finally got his foster license.

02:58.170 --> 02:58.970
Don't be a stranger.

02:58.970 --> 02:59.910
I won't.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.640
You okay?

03:02.020 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.390
I'll talk to you later.

03:04.390 --> 03:06.700
Okay. Let's go. Bye.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.070
Bye, y'all.

03:08.070 --> 03:09.480
This sucks.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.280
I mean, Jesus is at boarding school,

03:11.280 --> 03:13.450
Callie's at Girls United, Jude's at camp, 

03:13.450 --> 03:15.130
and Brandon's, like, never here.

03:15.130 --> 03:16.910
It's like I'm an only child.

03:16.910 --> 03:18.500
Woe is you.

03:18.930 --> 03:20.020
Woe is me.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.740
And no one even cares how I feel.

03:24.190 --> 03:25.420
That was Callie's social worker.

03:25.420 --> 03:26.790
Yeah, is she coming home?

03:26.890 --> 03:27.720
Nope.

03:28.150 --> 03:30.180
Apparently, after she spoke with Callie and Brandon,

03:30.180 --> 03:33.750
she found some inconsistencies she would like to discuss with us.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:18.300 --> 04:19.769
You've got pretty hair.

04:20.890 --> 04:22.230
Thanks.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.140
You've got a pretty face, too.

04:27.190 --> 04:29.950
Is that what you came in here to tell me?

04:30.160 --> 04:31.570
How pretty I am?

04:31.940 --> 04:33.110
I want you gone.

04:33.370 --> 04:35.110
You're not on probation, you don't got to be here.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.520
But I want to be here.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.390
I'm getting out of here in a few weeks,

04:38.390 --> 04:40.360
and if that doesn't happen because of you,

04:40.360 --> 04:42.940
my boyfriend's gonna cut that pretty little face of yours.

04:42.940 --> 04:44.600
Why are you so worried about me...

04:44.780 --> 04:46.530
if you didn't hit Carmen?

04:46.530 --> 04:48.280
I'm not worried about you.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.630
I just don't like you.

04:50.010 --> 04:51.680
That hurts my feelings.

04:51.690 --> 04:52.710
You think this is a joke?

04:52.710 --> 04:53.630
No.

04:54.510 --> 04:55.820
I think you are.

04:59.110 --> 05:00.440
As you all know,

05:00.440 --> 05:02.200
on Saturday, you'll be performing...

05:02.200 --> 05:03.410
I need ten hours with Jin.

05:03.410 --> 05:05.130
Ten? And when do I get him?

05:05.130 --> 05:06.030
Mornings and nights.

05:06.030 --> 05:06.930
And you get days?

05:06.940 --> 05:08.160
I have to drive back and forth.

05:08.160 --> 05:08.850
That's not my problem.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.080
Excuse me, gentlemen.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.160
You might want to pay attention.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.170
Sorry.

05:13.180 --> 05:16.130
What the judges are looking for is the "goose bump" factor.

05:16.130 --> 05:20.860
So, composers, please work with your pianist's performance.

05:20.870 --> 05:23.080
The passion of the play, not just the proficiency.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.620
Okay? Let's get to work. Clock's ticking.

05:26.820 --> 05:28.060
Six hours.

05:28.060 --> 05:29.510
Six hours? That sucks.

05:29.510 --> 05:30.800
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.510
Yeah, and you wouldn't have a prepared piano piece 

05:32.510 --> 05:33.640
if you hadn't ripped me off.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.520
Brandon, can I get a word?

05:35.530 --> 05:36.250
Sure.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.310
You had a rough start here at Idyllwild.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.590
Well, yeah, but that's because...

05:44.590 --> 05:45.990
You have a big ego.

05:47.250 --> 05:50.300
That's a good thing to have as an artist. Embrace it.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.050
And know that you're exceptional.

05:53.030 --> 05:54.090
Thank you.

05:54.090 --> 05:55.550
Do you believe you can win this thing?

05:55.550 --> 05:56.480
Do you?

05:57.690 --> 06:00.120
I mean, yes. Yes, I do.

06:00.540 --> 06:01.650
Good.

06:01.650 --> 06:02.650
So do I.

06:06.820 --> 06:08.500
What kind of inconsistencies?

06:08.500 --> 06:09.740
She didn't say.

06:09.750 --> 06:10.960
She wants to talk to some of the girls

06:10.960 --> 06:13.170
that were here with you at the same time.

06:13.170 --> 06:15.990
The only girls left are Daphne and Kiara.

06:15.990 --> 06:17.390
And Carmen.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.940
How's it going with her?

06:20.270 --> 06:21.060
Fine.

06:21.550 --> 06:22.360
And Brooke?

06:22.370 --> 06:23.190
Yeah.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.040
Hopefully, this is the last hurdle we have to jump over 

06:28.040 --> 06:29.520
and then you can come home.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.850
Have you heard what's happening with Rita?

06:32.860 --> 06:33.840
No.

06:34.190 --> 06:36.250
No charges have been brought against her.

06:36.250 --> 06:39.540
So far, as far as I know, the D.A. is still investigating, so...

06:39.540 --> 06:41.340
Carmen's lying.

06:41.630 --> 06:43.000
I think that you're probably right,

06:43.010 --> 06:44.720
but it's not your job to find out why.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.010
Okay? You have to keep your head down

06:47.270 --> 06:48.470
until we can get you home.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.690
You cannot get into it with these girls.

06:50.690 --> 06:52.750
Just a few days till the court date.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.200
This time next week, you'll be adopted.

06:55.720 --> 06:58.140
No one can take you away from us ever again.

06:58.410 --> 06:59.360
I love you.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.230
I love you, too.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.400
You hang in there.

07:06.430 --> 07:08.230
She's been at my place almost every night.

07:08.230 --> 07:10.270
I mean, the sex is great.

07:10.270 --> 07:11.420
Really great.

07:11.420 --> 07:12.960
I can hear you.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.950
And I really don't want to picture the principal of my school

07:14.950 --> 07:16.470
having sex with one of my mom's friends.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.380
Please.

07:17.380 --> 07:19.520
Sorry. Sorry!

07:19.520 --> 07:21.320
The thing is, Monte,

07:21.330 --> 07:23.440
she's not like your typical lesbian.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.080
She doesn't talk about her feelings.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.230
I think it's because she's used to dating guys.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.620
So she's playing her cards really close to her chest.

07:31.060 --> 07:32.720
And it's a great chest.

07:32.730 --> 07:33.840
Let me tell you.

07:34.150 --> 07:35.530
Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs.

07:35.540 --> 07:38.050
Mm, it was great to see you, sweetheart.

07:38.050 --> 07:41.150
The thing is, I am falling in love with this woman.

07:41.150 --> 07:43.370
And I don't even know if she's in love with me.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.190
So what do I do?

07:44.190 --> 07:45.890
Hey, uh, can we rent me a room 

07:45.890 --> 07:47.750
up in Idyllwild for the next two days?

07:47.750 --> 07:49.650
Uh, can you say hello to Jenna?

07:49.650 --> 07:50.940
Oh, hi, Jenna.

07:50.940 --> 07:53.090
Hey. Monte and I are driving up to watch you perform.

07:53.090 --> 07:54.520
We are very excited.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.600
Uh, yeah, I'm actually... I'm not performing,

07:56.600 --> 07:58.290
I'm composing.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.280
Uh, I just... I don't want to be losing all this time,

08:01.280 --> 08:02.380
you know, driving up and back.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.500
Let me talk to mom about it when she gets back, okay?

08:04.500 --> 08:06.270
Okay. All right, I'll be in the garage.

08:07.150 --> 08:08.860
Hey, don't eat all those chips before dinner.

08:08.860 --> 08:10.340
We're about to have dinner!

08:10.340 --> 08:11.430
You know what?

08:11.430 --> 08:13.610
I have a friend who has a cabin in Idyllwild.

08:13.610 --> 08:15.000
I bet you he'd let us use it.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.340
- Us? - Yeah.

08:16.340 --> 08:18.110
Brandon could stay there tomorrow night,

08:18.110 --> 08:19.420
and then,

08:19.420 --> 08:21.380
the rest of us could drive up on Friday night

08:21.380 --> 08:22.760
and we could spend the whole weekend there

08:22.760 --> 08:24.750
like a little mini couples getaway.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.190
Wouldn't that be fun? I'm gonna call her right now.

09:05.460 --> 09:06.860
You still think I'm a joke?

09:06.860 --> 09:09.410
Next time, you'll bleed.

09:13.290 --> 09:15.880
You're lucky that crazy meth head didn't run you down, girl.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.790
How is Brooke even talking to her boyfriend?

09:17.790 --> 09:19.580
You found a way when you were here.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.220
She's getting drugs from him too.

09:21.220 --> 09:22.170
In G.U.?

09:22.170 --> 09:24.060
I think you gotta bounce.

09:24.270 --> 09:25.070
What about Rita?

09:25.070 --> 09:27.300
Okay, girls. Lights out.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.980
Look, we got your back,

09:29.980 --> 09:32.050
but we can't watch it every minute of the day.

09:32.060 --> 09:33.350
She's right.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.790
Don't you think it's weird

09:43.800 --> 09:46.170
Carmen decided to wait to join the army?

09:46.710 --> 09:47.760
I don't know.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.600
Maybe she realized she's not the hard-ass she thought she was.

10:01.900 --> 10:02.920
Excuse me.

10:03.740 --> 10:05.410
I got a call about my grandma.

10:05.840 --> 10:06.920
Iris Hensdale?

10:06.920 --> 10:08.510
They said she had a stroke.

10:23.330 --> 10:24.780
A.J.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.110
Hey, grandma.

10:27.780 --> 10:28.830
How you doin'?

10:29.630 --> 10:31.450
I'm just fine.

10:34.380 --> 10:36.760
Do you see a man standing over there?

10:36.760 --> 10:37.930
Yeah.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.230
Okay. Good.

10:40.230 --> 10:41.340
That's Mike.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.030
He's my new foster father.

10:53.850 --> 10:56.100
You take care of my grandson.

10:56.630 --> 10:57.590
I will.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.910
So, I, uh, I did some research.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.130
And I found out that

11:25.130 --> 11:27.560
when you take your physical to get into the army,

11:27.560 --> 11:29.700
they drug test you.

11:30.060 --> 11:32.250
That's why getting your high school diploma 

11:32.250 --> 11:33.730
was suddenly so important.

11:33.730 --> 11:37.140
'cause you were afraid that if you didn't wait a few months,

11:37.140 --> 11:40.610
then you would test positive for crystal meth.

11:40.870 --> 11:42.230
That's why you and Brooke were fighting,

11:42.240 --> 11:43.670
because you took her drugs.

11:48.310 --> 11:49.740
Why, Carmen?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.100
You were so close to getting what you wanted. 

11:53.100 --> 11:54.480
Why did you use?

11:56.020 --> 11:58.010
I don't... I don't know.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.330
I was having a bad day.

12:05.290 --> 12:06.960
I just wanted to get high.

12:08.450 --> 12:10.020
So you made a mistake.

12:12.850 --> 12:14.660
Why lie about Rita?

12:14.660 --> 12:17.390
Because if I said that Brooke hit me, then she would have told.

12:17.390 --> 12:19.590
And if I test positive for drugs at any time

12:19.600 --> 12:23.350
during the application process, then that's it.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.640
You can never join the army.

12:26.650 --> 12:28.380
So, you have other options.

12:29.350 --> 12:30.500
No, I don't.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.360
When you're in a gang,

12:34.090 --> 12:36.160
they don't just let you leave.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.360
So what about Rita?

12:38.330 --> 12:39.490
She could lose everything.

12:39.490 --> 12:41.340
You don't care about her at all.

12:41.340 --> 12:42.720
I've got to care about me.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.360
My mom's a cop. She could drug test you right now.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.490
If you out me,

12:48.740 --> 12:52.040
I will out you to that social worker who's coming to talk to us.

12:52.040 --> 12:52.980
What do you think will happen

12:52.980 --> 12:55.040
if I tell her you and Brandon snuck around,

12:55.040 --> 12:57.110
seeing each other the whole time you were here?

12:58.010 --> 12:59.580
What about you shoving your tongue 

12:59.580 --> 13:01.540
down his throat at the fundraiser?

13:01.540 --> 13:03.320
You still think you'll get adopted?

13:04.090 --> 13:05.670
I thought we were friends.

13:06.060 --> 13:08.880
I don't have any friends.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.700
And don't think for a second

13:12.700 --> 13:14.860
I won't take you down with me.

13:26.770 --> 13:27.680
Okay, stop, stop.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.910
You're not playing with any passion.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.330
Well, it's a very difficult piece.

13:31.330 --> 13:33.590
Right, don't worry so much about the technique.

13:33.590 --> 13:35.910
Just... you know what tempo rubato is, right?

13:35.910 --> 13:38.150
Of course, but it says allegro.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.920
Don't be so literal. Yeah, you just...

13:40.920 --> 13:42.320
feel the music.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.530
Maybe if you told me what the piece was about.

13:45.970 --> 13:48.630
Um, okay. It's about...

13:48.630 --> 13:51.460
falling in love with someone you can never be with.

13:51.460 --> 13:52.570
Why not?

13:53.170 --> 13:56.840
Well, because sometimes it just doesn't work out.

13:56.840 --> 13:57.830
But why?

13:59.390 --> 14:02.060
Uh... have you ever been in love?

14:02.530 --> 14:04.120
Uh... no.

14:04.430 --> 14:06.360
Have you ever had a relative die?

14:06.360 --> 14:07.410
No.

14:07.410 --> 14:09.360
- A pet? - No.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.460
Has anything bad ever happened to you?

14:11.470 --> 14:12.530
Not really.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.280
My wisdom teeth got impacted.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.190
Okay, let's start again.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.460
No offense, but this piece is sort of a waste of my time.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.810
A waste of your time?

14:21.810 --> 14:22.530
What I mean is that...

14:22.530 --> 14:23.710
You don't think I can win this.

14:23.710 --> 14:26.050
No. I mean yes.

14:26.340 --> 14:28.390
Maybe. I don't know.

14:28.580 --> 14:31.090
But I don't think I can play this piece that you want me to.

14:31.090 --> 14:32.400
Then don't.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.940
You are obviously loyal to Tony.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.250
- Well... - Don't say you're Switzerland again.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.430
Okay.

14:38.590 --> 14:39.470
So what am I doing? 

14:39.470 --> 14:40.880
You're getting the hell out of here.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.050
So...

14:53.450 --> 14:54.470
how's it going?

14:57.160 --> 14:58.160
Well, someone had to stay

14:58.160 --> 15:00.280
to drive Callie and Mariana up tomorrow.

15:00.280 --> 15:01.980
Why did that someone get to be you?

15:01.980 --> 15:03.740
Because I didn't make the plan.

15:03.740 --> 15:05.330
- I'm here. - Have fun.

15:06.510 --> 15:08.510
I'll see you tomorrow. Love you.

15:08.510 --> 15:09.720
Love you too.

15:11.950 --> 15:13.450
Oh, it's beautiful up here.

15:13.460 --> 15:14.630
Right?

15:14.640 --> 15:17.270
It's nice to have friends with friends with cabins.

15:17.870 --> 15:19.190
Where's Jenna?

15:19.190 --> 15:20.730
She had some P.R. Crisis,

15:20.730 --> 15:22.580
so she's gonna drive up tonight.

15:23.010 --> 15:26.550
Well, Brandon is rehearsing, so I guess it's just us for dinner.

15:26.550 --> 15:30.500
Well, I brought grass-fed, antibiotic-free, 

15:30.500 --> 15:32.210
practically healthy steaks.

15:32.210 --> 15:33.660
Oh, I brought...

15:34.860 --> 15:36.190
a six pack of wine.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.460
It was buy five, get one free.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.070
What am I gonna do?

15:45.070 --> 15:47.960
I mean, this whole experience has sucked from day one.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.700
I mean, I thought this was a camp, not a competition.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.120
And I thought I was here to play piano.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.580
So do it. Play piano.

15:53.590 --> 15:56.180
I can't play my own piece. They won't let me.

15:56.180 --> 15:57.190
Then don't ask.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.200
Well, and also, I just technically can't play it. Okay? 

15:59.200 --> 16:00.030
I don't have the reach.

16:00.030 --> 16:02.400
I mean, since my hand got crushed in a car door...

16:02.400 --> 16:05.020
Oh, so what you want is to feel sorry for yourself.

16:05.020 --> 16:05.920
Is that it?

16:05.920 --> 16:07.610
Oh, thank you for your support.

16:07.610 --> 16:09.870
Hey! Hey, come on, don't be...

16:11.880 --> 16:14.570
I took a day off tour to come support you,

16:14.570 --> 16:17.680
But if you just wanna whine, that's okay too.

16:18.780 --> 16:23.240
Seriously, this piece I wrote is just very difficult.

16:23.540 --> 16:26.620
Okay? I would need, like, an extra hand to do it.

16:27.660 --> 16:29.110
That can be reached.

16:29.940 --> 16:32.230
So if Carmen tells the social worker that I kissed Brandon

16:32.230 --> 16:34.380
a few months ago, I'll never get adopted.

16:34.380 --> 16:36.440
Okay, look. Rita hasn't been charged yet.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.590
She may never be.

16:37.590 --> 16:38.570
It's not like you have any proof.

16:38.570 --> 16:40.350
It's still gonna be your word against Carmen's.

16:40.350 --> 16:41.520
No, it won't.

16:42.110 --> 16:43.300
I recorded her.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.380
On what?

16:46.240 --> 16:47.580
You got your phone?

16:47.580 --> 16:48.260
Yeah.

16:48.260 --> 16:51.030
Stef got Michelle to let me have it if I kept it a secret.

16:51.040 --> 16:51.950
So...

16:51.950 --> 16:54.300
I recorded her saying that Brooke hit her.

16:55.740 --> 16:57.720
So I can't help noticing you're still here.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.570
Callie's leaving tomorrow. You good with that?

17:00.570 --> 17:01.900
Tomorrow works.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.010
Oh, excuse me. I don't think you signed in.

17:11.010 --> 17:12.079
I'm leaving now.

17:12.079 --> 17:14.760
It's our policy, all visitors have to sign in.

17:21.490 --> 17:22.760
I'll stick around,

17:22.760 --> 17:24.270
till gram is out of the woods.

17:24.270 --> 17:25.310
Then I'm gone.

17:25.869 --> 17:27.530
Please don't go, Ty.

17:28.000 --> 17:28.790
You can stay here,

17:28.790 --> 17:30.710
and we can see each other anytime.

17:30.940 --> 17:32.290
You made your choice.

17:43.620 --> 17:44.920
Ty, hold up!

17:46.900 --> 17:47.970
Look,

17:48.780 --> 17:50.150
I'm not trying to get between you and your brother...

17:50.160 --> 17:51.110
You already did.

17:51.110 --> 17:52.280
I'm just trying to give him a home.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.250
I'm his home!

17:53.250 --> 17:55.350
Well, then stay. He needs you.

17:56.440 --> 17:57.520
Take care of him.

18:05.660 --> 18:06.880
Hey, Ty, hold up.

18:10.820 --> 18:11.930
Good luck.

18:13.890 --> 18:14.890
How you doin'?

18:17.690 --> 18:18.690
Take care.

18:22.730 --> 18:23.770
Everything all right?

18:24.470 --> 18:26.340
Yeah. Yeah, I tried to talk to him.

18:26.340 --> 18:29.130
Uh, listen, I left my jacket inside. I'll be right back.

18:49.840 --> 18:55.460
Wait, what about senorita Rosarita Rochin?

18:56.690 --> 18:58.440
What about her wig, more importantly?

18:58.440 --> 19:00.890
It's always a little out of kilter.

19:03.570 --> 19:05.780
But, you know, she's an excellent teacher.

19:05.780 --> 19:07.800
- Totally. She is. - Yes.

19:11.940 --> 19:14.590
So, um, how are things going with Jenna?

19:16.800 --> 19:18.210
Well...

19:18.210 --> 19:20.630
I like her, a lot.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.230
So...

19:22.230 --> 19:25.220
I don't know, I think her feelings might be

19:25.220 --> 19:28.070
progressing a little faster than mine.

19:28.860 --> 19:30.550
And, um...

19:30.550 --> 19:32.920
How are you finding dating a woman,

19:32.920 --> 19:34.070
in general?

19:34.070 --> 19:35.800
It's different.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.240
Um. Yeah, it's...

19:38.240 --> 19:41.920
I like the emotional connection, and um, I like...

19:42.910 --> 19:45.050
I like having sex with a woman.

19:48.180 --> 19:50.320
- There's that. - There's that.

19:51.780 --> 19:53.200
Okay, well,

19:53.210 --> 19:55.400
maybe, you know, you just need a little more time.

19:55.400 --> 19:59.710
Maybe. Or, you know, maybe she's just not the right woman for me.

20:06.370 --> 20:09.380
Now, if I thought I had a chance with Senorita...

20:09.380 --> 20:12.620
Rosarita Rochin.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.180
I was gonna end up saying...

20:15.890 --> 20:17.920
What's so funny?

20:17.920 --> 20:18.850
Nothing.

20:21.190 --> 20:22.460
How was your drive?

20:22.460 --> 20:24.180
It was fine.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.930
Yeah? Was there a lot of traffic?

20:25.930 --> 20:26.980
It was long.

20:26.980 --> 20:28.440
It was long? Yeah.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.520
How about a glass of wine?

20:31.380 --> 20:32.790
- Yes. - Yes, you do.

20:32.790 --> 20:33.970
Yes, you need to catch up.

20:33.970 --> 20:38.490
Yeah, I could definitely use a... drink.

20:41.990 --> 20:45.310
If everyone could please take their seats, we're about to begin.

20:46.290 --> 20:48.270
How's Mike's? You miss us?

20:48.270 --> 20:49.130
No.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.160
Maybe a little.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.070
Congratulations, by the way.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.440
So when are you coming to see me?

20:55.440 --> 20:57.230
...Composers and performers,

20:57.230 --> 20:58.980
they've worked very hard this summer.

20:59.070 --> 20:59.950
And not only are they playing for you,

21:01.760 --> 21:03.300
They are competing for a chance...

21:03.400 --> 21:04.490
Sorry I'm late.

21:04.490 --> 21:06.490
- Where's Monte? - She left.

21:06.780 --> 21:07.580
Why?

21:08.040 --> 21:08.970
We broke up.

21:11.330 --> 21:15.610
Our first performer is cellist Tori Phillips.

21:26.770 --> 21:29.620
Hey, uh, what'd you decide on Joe Olsen?

21:30.820 --> 21:32.070
Uh, I brought him in.

21:33.480 --> 21:35.200
- Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.150
Did you get anything out of him?

21:36.160 --> 21:38.580
Nope. No, I think you're right.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.120
There's no way to connect him to the guy in the bus.

21:41.220 --> 21:42.760
My theory's a little out there, you know.

21:44.220 --> 21:44.980
What?

21:45.930 --> 21:46.810
What's wrong?

21:47.600 --> 21:49.970
I'm just nervous about Brandon.

21:50.670 --> 21:52.720
Okay. Certainly not as nerve racking

21:52.720 --> 21:54.620
as it was when he was performing though, right?

21:55.080 --> 21:55.900
Yeah.

22:30.420 --> 22:31.320
What?

22:31.890 --> 22:32.780
Mat.

22:33.730 --> 22:34.780
What's he doing here?

22:34.850 --> 22:37.540
Our next composer is Brandon Foster,

22:37.650 --> 22:41.110
and you may recognize his pianist, Jin Chang.

22:47.020 --> 22:51.350
Although I'm on the composing track at Idyllwild,

22:51.350 --> 22:54.400
I decided to play my own piece.

22:54.490 --> 22:55.600
I realize that I might be

22:55.600 --> 22:57.480
disqualified from the competition,

22:57.810 --> 23:00.650
but I didn't come up here to Idyllwild to win.

23:01.270 --> 23:03.960
I came here to learn from my teachers

23:03.960 --> 23:05.980
and from my peers,

23:05.980 --> 23:07.850
not to compete against them.

23:08.310 --> 23:09.150
What's he doing?

23:09.380 --> 23:11.040
Kicking some ass.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.940
I had a hard time this summer

23:12.940 --> 23:15.400
because I got all caught up

23:15.400 --> 23:18.240
in trying to prove that I belonged here,

23:18.540 --> 23:21.710
that I lt the joy of making music.

23:22.770 --> 23:24.810
I'd like to reclaim that now,

23:25.080 --> 23:27.370
and do what I love most.

23:28.010 --> 23:28.910
Perform.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.190
What's he doing?

23:40.460 --> 23:42.360
Is he capable of playing his own piece?

23:43.010 --> 23:44.670
Quite a looping pedal he has.

25:42.600 --> 25:46.010
I'm so proud of you, my baby.

25:47.330 --> 25:50.190
- Share him with me. - Congratulations.

25:50.670 --> 25:52.020
You were awesome.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.020
I couldn't have done it without you, man.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.420
You were brilliant.

25:56.500 --> 25:57.220
Yeah.

25:59.640 --> 26:00.170
It was really nice of you

26:00.170 --> 26:01.490
to come out and support Brandon.

26:01.490 --> 26:02.420
Yeah, well...

26:02.650 --> 26:03.830
- Are you... - I've gotta...

26:04.360 --> 26:05.700
hit the road. So...

26:05.860 --> 26:06.860
Oh, you're...

26:06.920 --> 26:07.700
Yeah.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.450
Well, drive safely.

26:10.450 --> 26:11.320
I will.

26:12.050 --> 26:13.330
See ya, Mariana.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.060
See ya.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.170
I'm so proud of you.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.180
Thanks, dad.

26:21.460 --> 26:22.570
That was dope, man.

26:22.570 --> 26:24.970
Thank you. I heard you moved in.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.590
- Yeah. - Yeah.

26:27.420 --> 26:28.800
Well, he's a good dad.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.180
He'll be a good foster dad, too.

26:30.550 --> 26:31.860
And, uh... you know,

26:31.860 --> 26:34.550
I'll try to be a good foster brother.

26:35.310 --> 26:36.310
I appreciate that.

26:40.150 --> 26:41.350
Brandon, that was incredible.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.730
I don't understand how...

26:42.730 --> 26:45.110
Yeah, it's like a looper.

26:45.110 --> 26:45.800
It's like a looping machine.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.230
Essentially, you can put multiple tracks...

26:48.550 --> 26:49.800
Can I talk to you for a second?

26:49.800 --> 26:50.630
Yeah.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.360
Um, I just got an email.

26:54.680 --> 26:55.790
It looks like the D.A.

26:55.890 --> 26:57.730
is gonna be charging Rita with assault 

26:57.730 --> 26:59.250
and abuse of a minor.

26:59.760 --> 27:00.660
I'm sorry.

27:01.690 --> 27:03.670
- Hey. I'm taking off. - Hey.

27:03.770 --> 27:06.030
Okay, hold on a second. I will be right back.

27:06.180 --> 27:06.990
Okay?

27:08.170 --> 27:08.980
Come here.

27:57.820 --> 27:58.970
So what's going on?

28:01.070 --> 28:02.320
I'm sorry, I don't...

28:02.460 --> 28:03.910
I don't want to be such a bummer.

28:04.970 --> 28:06.660
It's okay. What happened?

28:06.910 --> 28:08.940
I don't know if I should tell you this.

28:08.940 --> 28:09.640
What?

28:10.900 --> 28:12.840
Monte and I broke up because...

28:14.060 --> 28:16.280
she has feelings for somebody else.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.760
Oh, honey. Who?

28:31.200 --> 28:32.570
That took a lot of balls,

28:32.740 --> 28:34.060
and your piece is amazing.

28:34.410 --> 28:36.440
Thank you, but you're gonna win.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.040
Well, you won the moral victory.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.500
If I could please have everyone's attention again.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.460
The judges have made their final decisions.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.980
I will start with the winning composer.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.840
The composer and pianist

28:51.850 --> 28:54.550
who will be performing at Disney Hall...

28:56.520 --> 28:57.550
Is Brandon Foster.

28:57.550 --> 29:01.670
Oh, my god! Brandon! Brandon!

29:03.480 --> 29:05.450
- Oh, my god! - Brandon!

29:05.550 --> 29:06.710
So proud of you!

29:17.200 --> 29:18.950
How are the designated drivers?

29:19.490 --> 29:21.510
You're the designated driver.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.950
Moms left us up here to keep an eye on Brandon,

29:23.990 --> 29:26.460
Make sure he doesn't over-celebrate.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.140
It's weird they went home.

29:28.790 --> 29:29.940
I mean, I get it.

29:30.330 --> 29:31.280
You know, when you're not feeling well,

29:31.280 --> 29:32.770
you just want to be in your own bed.

29:34.130 --> 29:35.800
I wanna be in my own bed.

29:36.120 --> 29:36.740
I'm so bored...

29:36.750 --> 29:37.850
Ah, Mariana.

29:40.330 --> 29:41.770
Can I talk to you?

29:42.600 --> 29:43.760
How bored are you now?

29:55.420 --> 29:56.670
I thought you left.

29:56.820 --> 30:00.510
I did, but then I turned around and came back.

30:01.450 --> 30:02.290
For what?

30:02.320 --> 30:04.070
I know why you broke up with me.

30:04.910 --> 30:07.060
When I extended the tour, I made you feel like

30:07.060 --> 30:08.960
that was more important to me than you.

30:10.180 --> 30:11.570
But nothing's more important.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.220
I want to spend the rest of the summer with you 

30:14.220 --> 30:17.460
if it's not... too late.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.220
You having fun?

30:26.260 --> 30:27.510
Yeah. I guess,

30:28.220 --> 30:29.100
You drunk?

30:29.240 --> 30:31.570
No, no, no. I'm just pretending.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.170
I didn't want to ruin how good I feel.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.110
Well, you deserve it.

30:37.030 --> 30:38.660
You know, you worked really hard.

30:39.270 --> 30:41.030
Your composition was beautiful.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.290
I couldn't have written it a year ago.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.340
So we haven't talked about A.J.

30:56.410 --> 30:57.750
It's none of my business who you date.

30:57.750 --> 30:58.820
I'm not dating him.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.010
Okay, well, kiss on your birthday then.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.440
Hey, can I ask you something?

31:08.210 --> 31:10.100
Did you come to Girls United

31:10.210 --> 31:11.210
the other night?

31:11.770 --> 31:12.630
No.

31:12.860 --> 31:13.700
Why?

31:13.810 --> 31:16.880
I just, um... I thought I saw your car outside.

31:34.730 --> 31:35.630
Hey, so...

31:35.790 --> 31:37.630
I'm kind of embarrassed to tell you this.

31:37.870 --> 31:38.620
What?

31:40.430 --> 31:44.010
The reason why I didn't want to have sex with you

31:44.860 --> 31:46.450
wasn't just because I was leaving.

31:50.230 --> 31:51.810
I wanted it to be special.

31:54.000 --> 31:54.860
I know.

31:55.100 --> 31:56.170
You told me that.

31:56.180 --> 31:58.030
Yeah, but I didn't tell you why.

31:58.740 --> 32:02.250
I've... never had sex before.

32:05.060 --> 32:07.720
I want my first time to be with the right girl.

32:09.580 --> 32:12.820
And I wanted us to lose our virginity together.

32:13.900 --> 32:14.840
You know?

32:15.370 --> 32:16.920
Somewhere romantic.

32:19.140 --> 32:20.040
Like here.

32:22.420 --> 32:23.350
Like now.

32:28.260 --> 32:29.160
If you want to.

32:42.130 --> 32:43.080
What's wrong?

32:45.430 --> 32:46.710
I'm not a virgin.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.360
But you... you told me...

32:55.360 --> 32:56.380
I was, but...

32:58.380 --> 33:00.110
I had sex with someone else.

33:10.850 --> 33:11.710
When?

33:13.270 --> 33:14.890
When we were still together.

33:28.460 --> 33:29.600
Thanks for doing this.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.520
No problem. What am I looking for?

33:32.010 --> 33:32.870
Any prints off the pen

33:32.870 --> 33:35.070
that match the ones on a hit-and-run vehicle.

33:35.470 --> 33:36.850
Case number's on the bag.

33:36.860 --> 33:38.990
Okay. It might take a few days.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.330
No problem. Appreciate it.

33:40.440 --> 33:41.510
All right, you got it.

33:46.030 --> 33:46.820
Honey?

33:48.030 --> 33:48.860
In here.

33:51.950 --> 33:52.980
What are you doing in here?

33:54.580 --> 33:55.570
Waiting for you.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.390
Does your head still hurt? Are you okay?

34:00.960 --> 34:02.590
Yeah, my head is fine.

34:03.550 --> 34:07.070
I just didn't want to ruin Brandon's day.

34:07.430 --> 34:08.520
Why would you ruin it?

34:14.260 --> 34:16.080
Are you having an affair with Monte?

34:17.060 --> 34:18.739
- No. - Are you in love with her?

34:18.820 --> 34:19.679
No!

34:22.060 --> 34:25.130
So there's nothing going on between the two of you?

34:25.460 --> 34:27.020
Why are you askinge that?

34:27.190 --> 34:28.760
Why don't you just answer me?

34:28.760 --> 34:30.190
There's nothing going on.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.080
What about when you kissed?

34:39.120 --> 34:41.070
I did not kiss her.

34:41.909 --> 34:43.000
She kissed me.

34:43.170 --> 34:44.320
Why didn't you tell me?

34:44.330 --> 34:45.610
Because I didn't want to upset you.

34:47.260 --> 34:49.750
You know, I feel like an absolute idiot.

34:49.750 --> 34:50.860
I've had that woman in our house...

34:50.860 --> 34:52.790
Nothing is going on. Nothing has ever gone on.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.860
How about in front of the fire, last night,

34:56.860 --> 34:58.110
just the two of you?

34:58.110 --> 34:58.730
No.

34:58.730 --> 35:01.090
Well, Jenna said that she thinks Monte's in love with you,

35:01.090 --> 35:02.490
and that's why they broke up.

35:02.490 --> 35:03.560
Oh, god.

35:03.730 --> 35:05.460
Jenna is being paranoid.

35:06.280 --> 35:07.510
Monte may not be in love with her,

35:07.510 --> 35:09.330
but it's not because she's in love with me.

35:09.330 --> 35:10.560
You know, it's really incredible

35:10.560 --> 35:11.930
because you've given me such a hard time

35:11.930 --> 35:13.280
about keeping things from you.

35:14.450 --> 35:15.770
You know, even in therapy.

35:15.900 --> 35:17.110
And yet, here you are sitting on

35:17.110 --> 35:18.290
the mother of all secrets.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.480
It was a kiss.

35:19.860 --> 35:21.450
It lasted a second.

35:23.110 --> 35:24.440
I was surprised, I pulled away,

35:24.440 --> 35:25.550
and I made it very clear to her

35:25.550 --> 35:26.910
that I am in love with my wife.

35:26.910 --> 35:28.890
I should have told you about it because it was nothing.

35:35.240 --> 35:37.320
If it was nothing, I think you would have told me.

35:48.570 --> 35:50.370
Mariana is in her room alseep.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.790
- Is she alone? - Yeah.

35:54.210 --> 35:55.450
I wonder what happened to Mat.

35:56.350 --> 35:57.120
I don't know,

35:57.520 --> 35:58.970
but they left this nice fire.

36:01.130 --> 36:03.490
So there's something I have to tell you

36:03.540 --> 36:06.330
before everything hits the fan.

36:07.940 --> 36:08.810
Okay.

36:08.810 --> 36:12.080
You know about Carmen accusing Rita of hitting her?

36:12.880 --> 36:13.650
Yeah.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.130
So she didn't.

36:15.270 --> 36:19.480
And I have a recording of Carmen admitting that she lied.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.180
I sent it to Rita

36:21.600 --> 36:22.550
to clear her.

36:24.050 --> 36:25.800
Well, that's good, right?

36:25.800 --> 36:28.390
Yeah. Yeah, it's good for Rita.

36:29.670 --> 36:31.440
It's not so good for me

36:32.410 --> 36:34.450
or you, sort of,

36:35.030 --> 36:36.260
because...

36:37.030 --> 36:38.960
Carmen knows that I kissed you

36:39.160 --> 36:40.420
at the fundraiser...

36:42.040 --> 36:45.620
And that we saw each other when I was at G.U.,

36:46.370 --> 36:49.510
and she's gonna tell my social worker everything.

36:49.660 --> 36:51.110
Can't you just deny it?

36:51.750 --> 36:53.230
Yeah, I can.

36:54.750 --> 36:57.020
But I didn't deny it in the recording.

36:58.140 --> 36:59.940
So now Rita knows too.

37:01.130 --> 37:03.130
And I'm pretty much screwed.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.660
The judge will never let Lena and Stef adopt me.

37:09.940 --> 37:13.250
And they're probably gonna be a little mad at you too,

37:13.250 --> 37:14.400
so, um...

37:15.090 --> 37:16.660
I'm sorry about that.

37:19.030 --> 37:21.720
I just... I couldn't let Rita go to jail

37:21.720 --> 37:25.050
and lose everything that she's worked so hard for.

37:25.380 --> 37:27.980
And she didn't do anything wrong,

37:27.980 --> 37:29.510
and the truth is, we did.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.060
I did.

37:35.940 --> 37:37.250
I hope you understand.

37:40.190 --> 37:42.370
I don't care about me.

37:43.900 --> 37:45.210
What's gonna happen to you?

37:48.430 --> 37:51.380
I can't go back to G.U.,

37:52.040 --> 37:52.900
so...

37:53.840 --> 37:55.930
Hopefully, I can live with my dad.

37:56.530 --> 37:58.140
Callie, there must be...

37:58.140 --> 38:00.660
No, it's just wasn't meant to be.

38:02.190 --> 38:03.040
None of it,

38:03.930 --> 38:05.450
I guess, was meant to be.

38:05.580 --> 38:08.880
*It came like a cloud*

38:11.330 --> 38:15.740
*Covered every doubt*

38:16.620 --> 38:18.450
I was outside of Girls United.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.510
The other night.

38:24.130 --> 38:29.190
*That the sun was faded out*

38:29.500 --> 38:32.610
*Smiling*

38:32.820 --> 38:35.560
*Will only save us for a while*

38:35.560 --> 38:39.040
*And wishing*

38:39.040 --> 38:41.830
*Won't hide what we're missing*

38:41.830 --> 38:43.450
I think we should just say good night.

38:43.940 --> 38:48.680
*Yeah, I love you*

38:50.440 --> 38:55.540
*But I shouldn't have said it yet*

38:57.270 --> 39:02.800
*And I know you feel it too*

39:03.530 --> 39:08.760
*But I was never good at playing hard to get*

39:09.960 --> 39:15.040
*If we could find a way to start the chase again*

39:16.240 --> 39:21.890
*Might we discover that we circled around the bend*

39:32.920 --> 39:34.920
*Around the bend*

39:42.750 --> 39:44.850
*Around the bend*

39:56.640 --> 40:01.600
*Yeah, I love you*

40:03.150 --> 40:08.140
*But I shouldn't have said it yet*

40:10.210 --> 40:16.650
*And I know you feel it too*

40:16.860 --> 40:22.820
*But I was never good at playing hard to get*

40:24.640 --> 40:29.650
*Yeah, I love you*

40:31.300 --> 40:36.070
*But I shouldn't have said it yet*

40:37.870 --> 40:43.520
*And I know you feel it too*

40:44.130 --> 40:49.420
*But I was never good at playing hard to get*

40:50.790 --> 40:56.180
*If we can find a way to start the chase again*

40:57.200 --> 41:02.780
*Might we discover that we circled around the bend*

41:13.940 --> 41:19.990
*Might we discover that we circled around the bend*
