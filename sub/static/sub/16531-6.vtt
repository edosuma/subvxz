00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.842
Previously on Empire...

00:08.876 --> 00:11.011
Wait till I launch
Empire XStream.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.413
Y'all gonna wish
y'all made this deal.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.248
I want you to destroy Gram.

00:14.282 --> 00:17.251
Battle me. I designed my
own little streaming apps.

00:17.285 --> 00:19.087
I'm-a have you bloody
and trending worldwide.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.689
You don't want to be mixing
those with alcohol, man.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.158
That song she did at Laviticus
is already getting crazy heat.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.260
And that song's
not what she wants.
I agree with him.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.696
LUCIOUS: Did he tell you that he
put in a bid to run for mayor?

00:28.729 --> 00:30.164
You think
he's gonna do that with

00:30.198 --> 00:32.533
a convicted felon on his arm?
Imagine what you could do

00:32.566 --> 00:34.902
with your own imprint.
LUCIOUS: Man, you better go

00:34.935 --> 00:36.036
get your girl back.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.340
*
(doorbell rings)

00:39.373 --> 00:41.375
All right, all right,
hold your horses!

00:41.409 --> 00:42.610
I'm coming.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.945
(doorbell rings)

00:44.978 --> 00:46.247
So sorry I'm late.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.881
Tiana's having a
little breakdown.
Hey.

00:47.915 --> 00:48.882
I'm sorry.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.284
This is for you.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.353
Oh. Thank you.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.788
Come here.
Thinking of me on your big day?

00:54.822 --> 00:57.225
Yes. You know some traditions
can't be disrupted.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.392
(laughs)

00:58.426 --> 01:00.027
Move, I got to get dressed.
Hey.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.762
Let me help you get dressed.
Come here.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.397
(laughs):
No, I can do it.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.965
Here, wait.
(phone chimes)

01:04.998 --> 01:06.734
Wait, one sec,
one sec, babe, one sec.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.102
It's okay.
Wait.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.470
Oh, no, that can wait.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.139
What's under this?

01:11.172 --> 01:12.273
(laughs)

01:12.306 --> 01:14.542
What's under this?
No, no, no.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.477
All right, look.
What's up?

01:16.510 --> 01:18.212
I don't want
our first time to be

01:18.246 --> 01:19.880
when you're getting ready
to run for mayor.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.249
You're distracted.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.117
(phone chimes)
See? Saved by the bell.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.785
Stay right there.
I'll be back.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.687
(phone continues chiming)

01:28.356 --> 01:30.624
Baby, I'm gonna have to go.
Okay!

01:30.658 --> 01:32.660
(laughs) You sent me an e-mail?

01:32.693 --> 01:33.927
I sure did.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.429
Open it up.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.798
Oh, a photo of...

01:37.831 --> 01:38.999
of all of you.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.268
Yes.
(mouths)

01:40.301 --> 01:41.502
Just a little reminder

01:41.535 --> 01:43.171
that you have my vote,
Mr. Mayor.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.772
Well, all right.
Mm-hmm.

01:44.805 --> 01:45.773
Mm-mm.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.608
Go do mayor stuff.
Bye-bye.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.643
(laughs)
Bye.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.445
(sighs)
(over phone): * They could try
to promise me forever *

01:51.479 --> 01:54.448
* But nobody loves me like me
What? Stop it!
Why is this playing?

01:54.482 --> 01:57.185
* They could say we're
better off together... *
Ugh! Stop it!

01:57.218 --> 01:58.486
Shut up, Tiana!

01:58.519 --> 02:00.821
JAMAL: * They're calling you
the Carrie *

02:00.854 --> 02:02.956
* And I'm your Mr. Big

02:02.990 --> 02:07.428
* A fairy tale hidden
under some other nonsense *

02:07.461 --> 02:09.530
* But like we say,
we're in a place... *

02:09.563 --> 02:11.332
Derek, I'm sorry.
It's still... it's too busy.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.934
I don't know. We need to
strip that down or something.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.469
Strip all of it away.
It's too busy.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.670
Oh, you buggin', man.
(music stops)

02:16.704 --> 02:18.005
This is a banger.

02:18.038 --> 02:20.674
Yeah, all right. Let's just
wait for some fresh ears

02:20.708 --> 02:22.410
till my mom gets here.

02:24.578 --> 02:25.979
You okay?

02:26.013 --> 02:27.815
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.550
I'm just, I'm off my pain meds.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.120
What? Philip freaked me out

02:33.153 --> 02:35.723
about all the artists that get
addicted to opiates. He's right.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.691
Yeah, well, that Philip dude
is a little extra.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.994
(over phone): * They can try
to promise me forever... *

02:41.028 --> 02:43.163
Yo, what's that?
* But nobody loves me
like me... *

02:43.197 --> 02:44.465
I don't know.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.133
* They could say
we're better off together *

02:46.166 --> 02:48.536
* But nobody loves me
like me... *

02:48.569 --> 02:50.638
The hell?

02:50.671 --> 02:54.842
* This time, keep yours
'cause I got mine, oh... *

02:54.875 --> 02:56.477
(Bella crying)
* Hush, little baby

02:56.510 --> 02:58.346
* Don't say a word

02:58.379 --> 03:02.316
* Mama's gonna buy you
a mockingbird *

03:02.350 --> 03:04.084
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

03:04.117 --> 03:07.255
* And if that mockingbird
don't sing *

03:07.288 --> 03:08.522
* Mama's gonna...

03:08.556 --> 03:10.157
You sound like
a wounded wildebeest in here.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.825
Man, whatever.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.495
She's a Lyon. She knows when
somebody's singing off-key.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.764
(sighs)
I got something
she'll love.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.533
(gentle chiming melody playing)

03:21.735 --> 03:24.272
(Bella quiets)

03:24.305 --> 03:26.206
How's that, Daddy's baby?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.075
Yeah, whatever.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.209
(chuckles)

03:29.243 --> 03:30.611
Are you coming in here
to thank me

03:30.644 --> 03:32.246
for helping your ass
with Shine?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.047
'Cause you know you still
owe me for that, right?

03:34.081 --> 03:35.349
Oh, relax.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.418
As soon as Shine
gets back from Vegas,

03:37.451 --> 03:38.786
he's gonna sit down with you,

03:38.819 --> 03:40.854
for you to be
the head of his A&R.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.089
He's been told.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.857
Really?

03:43.891 --> 03:44.858
Really.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.126
Thanks.

03:47.661 --> 03:51.031
(over tablet): * They can try
to promise me forever... *

03:51.064 --> 03:53.233
What the hell is this?

03:53.267 --> 03:54.702
What?

03:54.735 --> 03:57.571
* We're better off together

03:57.605 --> 03:58.906
* But nobody loves me
like me... *

04:01.575 --> 04:03.577
*

04:08.449 --> 04:09.617
THIRSTY: We're gonna find out
who's been...

04:09.650 --> 04:12.620
Pop, Thirsty,
this is Brian Piznarski.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.289
Piz is one of the top cyber-
security experts in the city.

04:15.323 --> 04:18.091
He's working with our
in-house I.T. guys.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.093
So, is it Piz or Piss?

04:20.127 --> 04:21.895
It's Piz, Pop.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.564
Okay. What's happening?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.098
All we know so far
is someone's hacked

04:25.132 --> 04:26.434
into Empire's e-mail server

04:26.467 --> 04:28.135
and pushed an MP3 file

04:28.168 --> 04:29.937
into the network's cell phones
and tablets.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.305
One of Tiana's demos.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.341
So they must have gotten
into the music servers.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.975
Well, they tried,
but the firewall's rock solid.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.244
The song's been passed around
as an e-mail attachment,

04:37.277 --> 04:38.679
but only internally.
THIRSTY: W-Wait.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.148
So, Empire XStream,
the subscriber information,

04:41.181 --> 04:42.683
that's all secure?

04:42.716 --> 04:43.917
Andre said
that was a top priority.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.519
No, it's life or death.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.920
If XStream

04:46.954 --> 04:48.456
subscriber data is compromised,

04:48.489 --> 04:50.324
that means we've blown
through $50 million.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.359
Put that down.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.428
Okay, Mr. Cyber Expert,

04:54.462 --> 04:56.964
who did this?

04:56.997 --> 04:58.599
Well, that's gonna
take some time, Pop.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.701
We need to give him a list
of possible suspects.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.302
THIRSTY: The way I see it is,
there's Tariq, there's Shine,

05:02.336 --> 05:04.271
and then there's
everybody else.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.139
Yeah, I mean,
Shine is a definite suspect,

05:06.173 --> 05:07.675
but this is way
too complicated

05:07.708 --> 05:08.842
for his ass.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.644
And I don't like to put
nothing past the FBI,

05:10.678 --> 05:12.613
'cause they love to play dirty.
Yeah.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.314
But this is too messy for Tariq.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.783
So, who else?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.150
What about your boy Vaughn?

05:17.184 --> 05:18.352
He and Birdman

05:18.386 --> 05:20.153
tried to buy
our streaming services.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.355
You turned him down.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.691
(sighs)
Get Vaughn's ass in here.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.359
On it.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.795
Look, in the meantime,
I need you to figure out

05:27.828 --> 05:29.329
what the problem is and fix it

05:29.363 --> 05:31.164
so we can get back
to using our e-mails.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.800
My head is about to burn
the hell off.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.802
Come on.
Yes, sir.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.203
NESSA: * 'Cause you like
the way I move *

05:36.236 --> 05:38.171
* And if you say that
you got me, you down for me *

05:38.205 --> 05:39.507
* I'm down for you
HAKEEM: * I'm down for you

05:39.540 --> 05:40.708
* Tell me you 'bout it

05:40.741 --> 05:43.677
* I got what you been feenin'

05:43.711 --> 05:47.381
* I don't want
nobody else but you *

05:47.415 --> 05:50.317
* Come show me
if you mean it *

05:50.350 --> 05:53.320
* I don't want
nobody else but you *

05:53.353 --> 05:56.323
* Don't want nobody else
but you *

05:56.356 --> 06:00.193
* I don't want
nobody else but you *

06:00.227 --> 06:01.261
(whoops)
* Don't want

06:01.294 --> 06:03.030
* Nobody else but you

06:03.063 --> 06:05.666
* I don't want
nobody else but you. *

06:05.699 --> 06:06.900
(music ends)

06:06.934 --> 06:08.101
(Nessa giggles)

06:08.135 --> 06:11.004
We're good together,
me and you, Nessa.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.740
Yeah. For sure.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.508
You know, me and
you got something

06:14.542 --> 06:15.909
you and Dre
never gonna have.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.310
We got music.

06:18.446 --> 06:21.849
Rakon, play it
from the bridge.

06:21.882 --> 06:22.850
Here it is.

06:22.883 --> 06:23.951
Come on.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.519
Hey, guys.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.421
What do you want?
I want to talk to you,

06:27.455 --> 06:28.556
brother to brother.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.757
Nessa, will you give us
a minute, please?

06:29.790 --> 06:31.525
Yeah.
Ain't nothing
to talk about.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.093
You stole her
out from under me.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.462
Now she got to choose.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.797
Nessa...

06:36.830 --> 06:39.633
I had no idea
you were into Nessa, Hakeem.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.768
Neither did she.
Listen.

06:40.801 --> 06:41.935
My big brother has a few issues

06:41.969 --> 06:43.203
I don't know if
he told you about.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.372
Hakeem, listen.
Whatever this is

06:45.405 --> 06:47.575
has nothing to do with me, okay?

06:47.608 --> 06:49.342
Now, I'm going to get
Shine from the airport.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.012
You drive safe, baby.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.923
You better fall back, boy.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.794
Mm.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.305
Oh, my God.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.573
THIRSTY:
Lucious.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.609
I got Mr. Vaughn Cooper for you.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.110
What up, L?

07:23.143 --> 07:24.411
What's going on,
fellas?

07:24.444 --> 07:25.846
What we doing?

07:25.879 --> 07:27.447
Have a seat, bro.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.417
What's this look
on y'all faces, man?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.852
I don't like it.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.420
What's happening?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.089
You know, where you
and me come from,

07:36.123 --> 07:38.792
if a man has an issue
with another man,

07:38.826 --> 07:40.594
he handles that man-to-man.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.295
We don't hide behind
a computer screen

07:42.329 --> 07:43.931
like a bunch of bitches,
you know?

07:43.964 --> 07:46.634
First of all,
who are you talking to?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.168
And where you going with this?

07:48.201 --> 07:49.436
ANDRE:
We know

07:49.469 --> 07:51.104
you hacked Empire's e-mail.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.640
Hacked their e-mail?

07:52.673 --> 07:54.508
Do I look like
I be hacking e-mails?

07:54.542 --> 07:55.843
You believe that?

07:55.876 --> 07:59.680
I invited you and Birdman
to my house as friends,

07:59.713 --> 08:04.017
to offer you an opportunity
to be a part of Empire XStream.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.053
Y'all tried
to buy me out.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.557
When I said no, maybe you felt
a certain kind of way.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.959
Maybe you wanted to hit me back
or something.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.894
I was working with Live Nation.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.029
I saw Empire XStream
was about to hit

08:16.063 --> 08:18.231
the bottom of the sea;
you was about to catch a brick.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.900
We tried to help you out.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.501
You we working
for Live Nation?

08:21.535 --> 08:23.671
Yeah, I was working
with Live Nation. I got fired.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.739
PIZ: All right,
all right, all right.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.140
Hey, uh, sorry to interrupt.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.677
If you've gotten any
e-mails, don't open them.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.478
What are you talking about?
Our e-mails are still down.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.681
No, the servers
just came back online.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.082
Somebody's doing this remotely.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.650
Hold on, I just got ten... 20...

08:36.684 --> 08:38.251
I just got 50 new e-mails.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.820
ANDRE: I'm-I'm getting flooded
with them, too, Pop.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.923
They're releasing every e-mail
ever sent to or from Empire.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.393
Delete them now!
No. It's got me locked out.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.328
Now it's a message.
(phone vibrates)

08:48.361 --> 08:49.730
ANDRE:
They want a million dollars

08:49.763 --> 08:51.665
wired to an offshore account...
LUCIOUS: What?

08:51.699 --> 08:53.667
...every hour on
the hour or we...

08:53.701 --> 08:54.935
Pop, Pop, Pop!

08:54.968 --> 08:56.003
Hey, hey! (grunts)

08:56.036 --> 08:57.370
Listen here,
Opie Cunningham!

08:57.404 --> 08:58.438
My son said you're
the best person

08:58.471 --> 08:59.940
in this business,
so I hired you.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.875
Now, you got
to the end of the day

09:01.909 --> 09:02.776
to fix this

09:02.810 --> 09:04.211
or that's your ass.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.412
You got me?

09:05.445 --> 09:06.814
Yeah. Yeah.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.250
Come on. Welcome to
the Empire. Let's go.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.088
Move your ass!
Get.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.724
All right, all right.
All right.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.698
PIZ:
The breach occurred at 2:48 a.m.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.299
They got access
to every e-mail

09:26.333 --> 09:29.369
that was ever sent or received
to an Empire company device.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.038
Well, how do we stop them?

09:31.071 --> 09:32.105
There's nothing to stop.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.407
They stole the data
and now it's gone.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.309
Yeah. And apparently they can
leak it out to the world

09:36.343 --> 09:37.945
little by little
or all at once.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.813
Right?
Unless we pay the ransom.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.949
I'd rather blow
my damn brains out

09:41.982 --> 09:44.317
before I give some punk living
in his mama's basement

09:44.351 --> 09:45.953
all my hard-earned money.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.320
Look,

09:47.354 --> 09:49.289
keep him away
from Empire XStream.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.491
I mean, we lose that,
we lose everything.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.927
Yeah. No, here.
Thank you.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.997
Every leaked e-mail
that mentions you by name.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.732
Color-coded, I might add,
by level of interest.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.067
So now you can see who's loyal

10:00.100 --> 10:01.769
and who's trying
to stab you in the back.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.570
Now, most of them still
revere you, of course,

10:03.603 --> 10:05.005
but I think we start here.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.506
We need to find that needle
in the haystack.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.641
Thanks.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.109
Thanks, Dre.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.578
2:48 a.m. I mean,
that's after hours.

10:11.611 --> 10:15.615
ANGELO: From the day I was born
at Mount Sinai Hospital--

10:15.649 --> 10:17.184
y'all know, just three blocks
from here...

10:17.217 --> 10:18.418
(crowd cheers)

10:18.451 --> 10:22.189
...New York City
has been my home.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.991
(crowd cheers)

10:24.024 --> 10:28.261
I went to school at P.S. 180,
right here in Upper Manhattan.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.597
Matter of fact,
that's where I learned

10:30.630 --> 10:32.365
what matters most in life...
(phone ringing)

10:32.399 --> 10:33.967
...to be of service to others.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.770
(crowd cheers)

10:36.804 --> 10:39.673
Because I still believe
in the untapped potential

10:39.707 --> 10:41.675
of this great city.
(phone chimes)

10:41.709 --> 10:43.777
Hello.
I know that together,

10:43.811 --> 10:45.612
we can make this city
an even better place

10:45.645 --> 10:47.447
to raise our children.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.448
Phone call for you.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.950
Why? On your phone?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.985
Would you mind stepping away
and keeping your voice down?

10:52.019 --> 10:54.321
ANGELO:
An issue that is very,

10:54.354 --> 10:55.856
very important
to me is violence...

10:55.889 --> 10:56.857
Who is this?

10:56.890 --> 10:59.359
Lucious, I am busy.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.295
Look, whatever it is,
it can wait.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.631
Emergency board meeting? Now?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.066
(sighs)

11:06.099 --> 11:07.134
(crowd cheers)

11:07.167 --> 11:09.136
Christian.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.304
ANGELO:
WOKE stands for

11:11.338 --> 11:15.743
We Organize
Knowledge Empowerment.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.080
The board has reviewed
the situation,

11:20.113 --> 11:22.515
and we think we should consider
paying the ransom.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.217
LUCIOUS:
Y'all out of y'all mind.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.486
Negotiate with terrorists?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.756
Better start looking
for a new CEO, then.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.024
Co-CEO.
And she hasn't weighed in.

11:31.058 --> 11:34.594
Look, I know this is
uncomfortable for you all,

11:34.627 --> 11:38.098
but Lucious and I have been
up against much worse,

11:38.131 --> 11:40.233
so we're not scared
of a few leaked e-mails.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.534
What about leaked e-mails

11:41.568 --> 11:44.204
that suggest that someone is
laundering corporate funds?

11:44.237 --> 11:45.438
So, what are you getting at,
lady?

11:45.472 --> 11:46.506
Okay, wait, wait,
wait. Hold up.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.941
Lucious, we haven't given

11:47.975 --> 11:49.509
Andre an opportunity
to explain.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.744
Go ahead, baby.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.945
ANDRE:
Yes, ma'am.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.747
Um, Vernon Turner,

11:53.781 --> 11:55.582
my late uncle-- may
he rest in peace--

11:55.615 --> 11:58.051
had a fondness
for prostitutes.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.420
When the company went public,
I discovered he sometimes used

12:00.453 --> 12:03.723
company funds
to entertain them.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.993
I covered it up
to protect the IPO.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.197
Clearly, in light of this,

12:10.230 --> 12:12.800
Andre will have to step down
and resign from the board.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.402
Really? 'Cause according
to those leaked e-mails,

12:15.435 --> 12:18.939
Vernon wasn't the only person
around here who paid for sex.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.941
Frequently.
(chuckles)

12:23.743 --> 12:25.412
You mean Papa Bernstein?

12:25.445 --> 12:26.880
That's exactly
who I mean, Pop.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.315
And I seen
some e-mails that put

12:28.348 --> 12:29.917
your freak flag on
blast, too, Edna.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.719
My father's attorney,
Mr. Rawlings,

12:32.752 --> 12:35.789
has corroborating stories.
Ain't that right, Thirsty?

12:37.690 --> 12:38.725
LUCIOUS:
Yeah, but everybody

12:38.758 --> 12:40.127
ain't weighed in yet.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.230
(phone vibrating)

12:43.263 --> 12:45.298
Good God, what is it now?

12:46.934 --> 12:49.436
Yes, Tiana?
Well, in view of this,

12:49.469 --> 12:52.405
do we have any other ideas
on how to...

12:52.439 --> 12:55.142
deal with this leaked e-mail
situation?

12:55.175 --> 12:58.145
Tiana, I'm off you.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.847
You nothing to me.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.015
You wack in bed, honestly.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.584
I mean, I'm just keeping it
real. Honestly, you nothing.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.787
Okay? Your singing is mediocre.

13:07.821 --> 13:11.424
Matter of fact, you and Empire
can kiss my black ass.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.160
You already did that, though.
(chuckles)

13:13.193 --> 13:14.862
Tapped it, homie.
(crying softly)

13:14.895 --> 13:16.796
Y'all some dumb-asses!

13:19.332 --> 13:22.135
He turned out to be
a real busta, huh?

13:22.169 --> 13:23.971
BECKY:
Mm-hmm.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.372
He wishes he had half your fans.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.341
Too bad I'm not
on your team anymore.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.845
This hack is exposing
all of my business,

13:31.879 --> 13:34.047
and you have to do
something about it.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.949
Look, it's exposing
everybody, baby.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.985
What business of yours
has it exposed?

13:38.018 --> 13:39.352
Okay, look, girl,
you need to back dow...

13:39.386 --> 13:41.288
Lobby. Right now.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.923
We got some problems.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.062
Return all your old cell phones
on the right.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.364
Receive your new phones
on the left.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.300
Watch your step, people.
Come on through.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.501
Come on, keep it
moving, people.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.905
I can't believe Steve Cho
said that about me.

13:57.938 --> 14:01.808
Y'all see this?
Look at this.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.011
Everybody's e-mails.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.717
Oh, Dad, we were just
coming to get you.

14:10.750 --> 14:11.751
Guess who's here.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.486
Mm-hmm.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.422
Oh, what's up, T? You see
your boyfriend's Snaps?

14:15.455 --> 14:17.690
Or should I say ex-boyfriend?

14:17.724 --> 14:19.392
Read between the lines.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.560
Mwah.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.262
I should've known your ass

14:22.295 --> 14:23.496
would be showing up.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.698
Take cyberterrorism
seriously.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.834
Even when the victim is
a dangerous miscreant.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.402
We're here to investigate.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.838
Investigate what?
How y'all leaked my e-mails?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.740
TARIQ:
Feds don't leak information,

14:33.773 --> 14:36.209
big brother, we
gather it and use it

14:36.243 --> 14:38.045
to lock all you
criminals away.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.415
(crowd gasps, murmurs)

14:42.449 --> 14:43.716
What?

14:43.750 --> 14:45.352
What is that?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.087
(distorted voice murmuring)

14:50.623 --> 14:52.125
What the hell is it now?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.695
(crowd gasps, groans)
Ooh!

14:55.728 --> 14:57.064
Oh...

14:57.097 --> 14:58.398
(gasps)

14:58.431 --> 15:00.500
(crowd murmuring, chuckling)

15:03.103 --> 15:04.137
Ma?

15:07.941 --> 15:09.977
(yells)

15:11.344 --> 15:13.446
(crowd gasps, screams)

15:13.480 --> 15:14.647
WOMAN:
Oh, okay.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.418
Now, what the hell
y'all looking at?!

15:18.451 --> 15:19.987
They perky.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.022
Move!

15:29.929 --> 15:32.099
I just got a call
from Angelo's

15:32.132 --> 15:35.168
campaign manager asking if
you leaked that picture of me

15:35.202 --> 15:36.936
to mess with his announcement.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.938
I don't give a damn
what you and Ray-J do

15:38.972 --> 15:40.173
in the privacy of your home.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.909
But since you're
on the subject,

15:42.942 --> 15:44.477
don't you think
you're a little too old

15:44.511 --> 15:46.346
to be sending naked pictures
of yourself?

15:46.379 --> 15:47.780
Are you jealous, Lucious,

15:47.814 --> 15:49.649
because you got to lift
your fat-ass stomach up

15:49.682 --> 15:50.883
to find your...

15:51.951 --> 15:52.852
(sighs)

15:52.885 --> 15:54.254
What is she doing here?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.256
I was just here
for my meeting with Shine

15:56.289 --> 15:58.625
when all of this
started blowing up.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.827
SHINE: She told me you think
I'm the one that hacked you.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.529
I didn't do it, Lucious.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.297
It's not my style. At all.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.367
COOKIE:
Why is she meeting

16:07.400 --> 16:09.102
with Shine?
She's interviewing

16:09.136 --> 16:10.803
to be his A&R.
(laughs)

16:11.871 --> 16:13.173
(scoffs softly)

16:13.206 --> 16:14.707
What, you want the job, Cookie?

16:14.741 --> 16:15.942
Child, please.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.710
(scoffs)

16:17.744 --> 16:19.279
I guess it's true
what they say.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.548
The camera does
add ten pounds.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.383
COOKIE: Well, then
what is your excuse,

16:23.416 --> 16:24.617
fat-ass?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.186
That's ambition.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.055
Oh. Be ambitious enough

16:28.088 --> 16:30.757
to put the phone down, bitch.
(chuckling)

16:32.759 --> 16:34.361
(clears throat) Look, Lucious,

16:34.394 --> 16:36.329
for what it's worth,
I believe Shine.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.565
All right? All he's ever
wanted is a legit shot

16:38.598 --> 16:40.733
in the industry and now he's got
a stake in Empire with Nessa.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.235
Doesn't make any sense.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.904
She's right. I may stomp
a hole through somebody,

16:44.937 --> 16:46.406
but I ain't no
Internet thug.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.675
(phone buzzing)
Plus, I have no desire

16:48.708 --> 16:50.543
to see Cookie's cookies.
(chuckles)

16:52.079 --> 16:53.146
What is it?

16:53.180 --> 16:55.148
It's the hackers.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.250
They say, "Get ready.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.018
We have so much more."

17:01.921 --> 17:04.257
Yo, every major music blog
is trashing

17:04.291 --> 17:06.193
the Tiana single
that leaked, man.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.161
You talking about the song
that you pressed for

17:08.195 --> 17:10.363
instead of "Starlight"?
That's on you.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.898
All right, listen, okay?

17:13.866 --> 17:15.602
Will you tell me what to do?

17:15.635 --> 17:18.405
Boy, bye. I'm not even on her
team anymore, thanks to you.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.940
And even if I was,
all I'd have to do is...

17:22.609 --> 17:23.943
Never mind.
No, don't--

17:23.976 --> 17:25.678
No, no, no, don't "never mind."
Listen to me.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.347
Hey, I'll get you
back on the team.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.882
Yeah, I will. I'll make sure
that you get credit.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.984
All you have to do is
you just got to help me.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.056
All right.
Okay.

17:37.090 --> 17:40.026
Angie Martinez has been
sweating me for an exclusive.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.929
I could tell her that that
song was an unfinished demo

17:42.962 --> 17:44.931
and offer up the world
premiere of "Starlight"

17:44.964 --> 17:47.200
as the lead single
for her next album.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.535
It's that easy.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.403
That's good.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.872
That's good. All right,
would you do that for me?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.041
On one condition.
Hmm?

17:55.074 --> 17:57.410
When I tell Cookie and
Tiana that it was my idea,

17:57.444 --> 17:59.212
Mm-hmm.
you need to back me up.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.448
Of course. Done and done.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.649
I got you. Okay.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.388
"Leviticus 20:13 tells me

18:08.421 --> 18:10.990
"to kill your gay ass on sight,
Jamal Lyon.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.825
Hope you burn in hell."

18:12.859 --> 18:15.061
You never knew about these?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.264
It seems Empire got

18:17.297 --> 18:19.766
a grip of them
when I came out.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.769
My mom didn't want my dad
to show it to me, but, you know,

18:22.802 --> 18:24.537
Internet is forever, so...

18:26.038 --> 18:27.740
(sighs)

18:27.774 --> 18:29.342
You okay?

18:29.376 --> 18:31.144
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.447
I'm not gonna fall
off the wagon,

18:34.481 --> 18:35.515
if that's what
you're thinking.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.589
It's interesting,
though, 'cause it ...

18:42.622 --> 18:44.791
What's so interesting
about this hack is that

18:44.824 --> 18:46.926
it feels real personal,
you know?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.528
These are things that
they're putting out there

18:48.561 --> 18:50.763
about me and my mom,
my dad, my brothers,

18:50.797 --> 18:51.964
my dead uncles.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.266
It's like,

18:53.300 --> 18:54.934
pick off a Lyon one at a time.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.303
Hmm.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.770
Fellas.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.739
Hey.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.644
Ready to get started?

19:04.677 --> 19:06.946
Yeah.
(clears throat)

19:06.979 --> 19:08.147
I'm out.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.148
Jamal.
Yeah.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.883
See you later.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.855
(door opens, closes)

19:15.888 --> 19:18.325
Now that he's
out the way.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.065
Should listen
to what I did.
All right.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.000
JAMAL:
* Calling you the Carrie

19:28.034 --> 19:29.702
* And I'm your Mr. Big

19:29.736 --> 19:34.474
* A fairy tale hidden
under some other nonsense *

19:34.507 --> 19:36.142
* But like we say,
we're in a place *

19:36.175 --> 19:39.812
* Where we don't have
to follow the rules *

19:39.846 --> 19:42.014
(electronic squeaking)

19:42.048 --> 19:44.917
* Way down here in Jamaica,
you like me... *

19:44.951 --> 19:47.654
Wait, what... What's...?

19:47.687 --> 19:50.423
Derek, what are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

19:50.457 --> 19:52.191
I'm not doing anything.
(music distorting)

19:52.225 --> 19:53.159
What is happening?

19:53.192 --> 19:54.193
Tracks are being erased.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.162
No. Uh-uh. No.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.264
What the hell?
Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.265
Move. Wait. Hold on.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.232
Stop. Wait.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.400
(distorted music playing)

20:00.433 --> 20:01.434
(tapping keyboard)

20:01.468 --> 20:02.535
(music stops)

20:02.569 --> 20:04.103
What is this?!

20:04.136 --> 20:05.405
Okay, none of the sequences
are updating.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.275
Let's see if we can go
back to the main...

20:08.308 --> 20:10.042
See if I can get to
a C prompt and maybe

20:10.076 --> 20:11.544
we can start over from there.

20:11.578 --> 20:12.879
(electronic chirp)

20:12.912 --> 20:15.214
No, no. Come on.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.683
Okay, what just happened?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.785
This isn't just
an e-mail hack anymore.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.420
They're in the system.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.688
You got to be kidding me.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.922
They're in my system?

20:22.955 --> 20:24.791
They got access
to everything, Lucious.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.125
All of Empire's assets.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.193
Payroll records, masters,

20:27.226 --> 20:28.628
anything
of proprietary value.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.264
Wait. XStream's
subscribers database?

20:31.298 --> 20:33.600
That's a question
for Poindexter.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.968
I... I don't know.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.571
Oh, that's not
the answer we want.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.939
Come on, Nintendo.
Get to typing.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.207
Let's go. Fix it.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.109
Let's go.
We'll just reboot.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.011
(doorbell rings)

20:47.013 --> 20:48.448
(doorbell rings)

20:49.482 --> 20:51.684
(takes deep breath)

20:53.286 --> 20:54.721
Hey. Ooh.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.823
You look good.
Thanks.

20:56.856 --> 21:00.226
I heard you stopped by
the office. What's up?

21:00.259 --> 21:03.095
Um, your campaign manager

21:03.129 --> 21:05.498
wouldn't let me see you,
because he said

21:05.532 --> 21:07.600
the picture that got leaked

21:07.634 --> 21:09.336
ruined your
campaign announcement,

21:09.369 --> 21:11.103
so...
For real?

21:11.137 --> 21:12.605
Yeah. (chuckles)

21:15.308 --> 21:16.776
Okay.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.210
I just fired his ass.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.913
Angelo, you can't just do...

21:20.947 --> 21:22.415
Yes, I can.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.116
And I just did.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.118
And anybody else
that disrespects you

21:26.152 --> 21:28.421
is gonna find their ass
on the unemployment line

21:28.455 --> 21:30.390
as well.
(chuckles softly)

21:32.124 --> 21:34.527
I can't let you do this.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.662
Come on, now,

21:35.695 --> 21:36.696
this'll blow over.
Look,

21:36.729 --> 21:38.831
when I first met you,
I thought you were

21:38.865 --> 21:41.801
some bougie, stuck-up guy doing
your little community service

21:41.834 --> 21:44.103
because you didn't have to work.
Mm-hmm.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.305
But I believe in you, Angelo,

21:46.339 --> 21:48.675
and I... think you can do

21:48.708 --> 21:51.511
some amazing things
for this city.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.012
Well, thank you

21:53.045 --> 21:55.848
for believing, Cookie.
But...

21:55.882 --> 21:59.118
if you stay with me,
you're gonna lose, because...

21:59.151 --> 22:01.521
there's some things
about my past,

22:01.554 --> 22:03.890
or about me, period,
that your opponent can use,

22:03.923 --> 22:05.291
and will use.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.659
Trust me,

22:06.693 --> 22:08.327
you don't know the half.
Look, look...

22:08.361 --> 22:11.798
I can handle whatever
anybody... they got...

22:11.831 --> 22:13.466
I can't, though. I can't.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.967
I wouldn't be able to handle

22:15.001 --> 22:16.969
if you lost this election
because of me.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.871
(sighs)

22:20.106 --> 22:24.043
I'm so glad we didn't go
to the next level.

22:24.076 --> 22:27.246
What do you mean?

22:27.279 --> 22:29.482
I think you should go.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.384
Whoa. Wait, Cookie.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.920
Please.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.589
I don't want to cry
in front of you.

22:39.726 --> 22:42.094
(sighs)
Okay.

22:52.405 --> 22:54.874
(sighs)

23:07.720 --> 23:10.356
That's it, man.
I tried everything.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.992
All the tracks are gone,
and we're locked out.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.064
(sighs)

23:18.097 --> 23:20.366
This happened
for a reason, all right?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.535
I wasn't even
feeling the tracks.

23:22.569 --> 23:25.237
So we just... You
know, we just got to

23:25.271 --> 23:27.306
trust that, you know?
You need to get back

23:27.339 --> 23:30.777
on your pills, man,
'cause you losing your mind.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.547
Hey. Hey.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.815
Your hands
are shaking, man.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.755
Well, um... we're gonna
start from scratch.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.591
All right, go analog.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.225
Scare up some old-school stuff
or something.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.628
I don't know.
Figure it out, D.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.429
All right?

23:53.132 --> 23:56.068
Come on, Pop. You want me
to fire all these people?

23:56.102 --> 23:59.405
Each and every one of them.
For disrespecting you
in their private e-mails?

23:59.438 --> 24:00.973
Loyalty is everything
to me, son.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.675
I want a clean house.

24:02.709 --> 24:05.512
Andre, on your orders,
the security team

24:05.545 --> 24:07.747
did a high-level search
of the entire building.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.115
They found this in studio six.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.683
What is it?

24:10.717 --> 24:12.218
It's a keylogger.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.289
ANDRE:
Tiana, we need to talk.

24:17.323 --> 24:20.092
How do y'all expect us
to work like this?

24:20.126 --> 24:21.861
How long have you
been working in here?

24:21.894 --> 24:23.930
A couple of weeks. Why?

24:23.963 --> 24:25.498
Has anybody else been in here
with you?

24:25.532 --> 24:27.500
Just me and the engineers
and my team,

24:27.534 --> 24:29.802
my girls, Gram.

24:29.836 --> 24:32.639
That jerk was supposed to be
on my album until last week.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.808
Gram wasn't
on the list, Pop.

24:35.842 --> 24:39.478
Wait. Y'all think
Gram hacked Empire?

24:39.512 --> 24:40.713
Do you think
he has the capability

24:40.747 --> 24:42.014
to pull something
like this off?

24:42.048 --> 24:44.483
Well...

24:44.517 --> 24:47.620
He broke into my phone once.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.455
He didn't even have
the passcode or anything.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.323
He said passcodes
are for amateurs.

24:51.357 --> 24:54.460
And he does all
his own recording.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.496
And he hates on all the
labels, especially Empire.

24:58.898 --> 25:02.134
And he called you, like,
a dinosaur of a Philistine era,

25:02.168 --> 25:03.670
or something like that.
(laughing)

25:03.703 --> 25:05.237
Bitch, you think that's funny?

25:05.271 --> 25:07.006
He was furious
when you sent him

25:07.039 --> 25:09.041
to challenge Hakeem, and
he didn't get to battle.

25:09.075 --> 25:12.679
He said he was gonna
humiliate all of y'all.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.582
Wait. He said he
was gonna do what?

25:15.615 --> 25:17.584
Humiliate you.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.359
(horns honking)

25:32.431 --> 25:35.301
Well, what's this?

25:36.903 --> 25:39.071
How the hell y'all
get in my house, man?

25:39.105 --> 25:40.506
LUCIOUS:
I suppose

25:40.539 --> 25:42.875
the same way you
got into our servers.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.044
What you talking about?

25:45.077 --> 25:46.512
You hacked Empire.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.281
Wait. I did what?

25:51.083 --> 25:52.919
I know what this is.
I'm getting punk'd.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.187
Ashton.
Where Ashton Kutcher at?

25:55.221 --> 25:57.523
(laughs)

25:57.556 --> 25:59.892
Y'all are serious.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.694
I see what this is.
Since y'all look

26:01.728 --> 26:03.395
like a bunch of exposed clowns,

26:03.429 --> 26:06.065
now you're trying
to save the day by blaming me.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.900
You know what, son?

26:07.934 --> 26:10.603
When we first got here,
I thought this was

26:10.637 --> 26:12.739
one of them big old Jamaican
Cheech and Chong joints.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.206
(laughter)

26:14.240 --> 26:16.308
(inhales)

26:16.342 --> 26:19.879
And then I realized you a whole
different class of brother.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.615
I wouldn't have thought
you were smart enough

26:22.649 --> 26:25.885
to pull something like this off,
but I'll admit it.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.120
I was wrong about you.

26:28.154 --> 26:31.123
You're right.
I could have pulled it off...

26:31.157 --> 26:33.626
if I wanted to.

26:34.861 --> 26:37.830
We found everything
on your computer... brother.

26:37.864 --> 26:40.867
(Lucious laughs)

26:42.468 --> 26:44.771
And you used this
to get our passcodes,

26:44.804 --> 26:47.439
but you got sloppy.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.742
We found it in a studio where
you were recording with Tiana.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.144
Okay, big shoulders,
you are way up here, okay?

26:52.178 --> 26:53.746
I'm gonna need you
to bring it down a notch.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.247
(Lucious and Andre laughing)
Look,

26:55.281 --> 26:57.149
I could easily take y'all down,

26:57.183 --> 26:58.617
but I'm not sloppy.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.286
And I damn sure
wouldn't have

27:00.319 --> 27:01.688
left that behind.
I mean, not to brag or boast.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.122
I wouldn't even need it.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.124
But let me ask
you a question.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.994
Why the hell would I go through
the trouble of hacking you?

27:10.196 --> 27:12.098
What did he call me, son?

27:12.131 --> 27:13.866
He said I was a dinosaur

27:13.900 --> 27:15.835
from the Philistine era,

27:15.868 --> 27:18.771
going around dropping
these gargantuan turds

27:18.805 --> 27:20.773
all over the Earth
in a desperate attempt

27:20.807 --> 27:22.041
to remain relevant.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.010
That's what I heard, Pop.

27:24.043 --> 27:27.213
Okay. You know,
since y'all so convinced...

27:27.246 --> 27:29.181
what are you gonna do?

27:29.215 --> 27:30.516
Call the cops?

27:30.549 --> 27:33.285
That's what white folks do.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.988
We got something better in mind.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.024
(door closes)

27:42.494 --> 27:43.963
SHINE:
Hey, where you going?

27:43.996 --> 27:45.798
The party just started.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.566
$80,000 chair, bro.
(grunts)

27:47.599 --> 27:50.202
Oops. I hope
they don't hurt him.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.905
(laughter)

27:54.073 --> 27:55.407
Nice work, son.

27:55.441 --> 27:56.642
Yes, sir.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.211
Shine, my man.
Lucious.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.180
I'll bring you
a souvenir.

28:01.213 --> 28:02.581
Oh, please do.

28:02.614 --> 28:06.886
LUCIOUS:
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.955
Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.895
*
(cheering)

28:18.197 --> 28:20.699
To the Empire!

28:20.733 --> 28:23.669
(cheering, shouting)

28:23.702 --> 28:27.606
Now, although we faced
a hell of a crisis today,

28:27.639 --> 28:30.743
we not only survived as a result
of you and your loyalty,

28:30.777 --> 28:32.611
we thrived!

28:32.644 --> 28:34.847
(cheering)

28:34.881 --> 28:37.049
Now, before we get
to celebratin',

28:37.083 --> 28:39.185
I would like
Mr. Leonard Bernstein,

28:39.218 --> 28:40.753
our chairman of the board,

28:40.787 --> 28:42.554
to come and make
a few announcements.

28:42.588 --> 28:45.091
He's a white cat,
but he's an all right cat.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.093
(applause, cheering)

28:48.494 --> 28:50.696
Thank you, Lucious.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.099
It takes true leadership

28:53.132 --> 28:58.037
to turn a debilitating crisis
into an opportunity for growth.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.072
But that's exactly
what Andre Lyon did.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.141
And that's why the board

29:02.174 --> 29:05.577
has named him president
of Empire XStream.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.379
(cheering)
Congratulations, Andre.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.216
(cheering)
MAN: Andre!

29:10.249 --> 29:11.818
LUCIOUS:
Thank you, Leonard.

29:11.851 --> 29:15.454
Now I'd like to invite
to the stage my co-CEO.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.756
She is the mother
of my children,

29:17.790 --> 29:19.658
the most beautiful
and talented...

29:19.691 --> 29:20.993
(electronic feedback)
Thank you.

29:21.027 --> 29:23.329
(applause, cheering)

29:23.362 --> 29:25.097
Cookie Lyon!

29:25.131 --> 29:27.333
As you all know,

29:27.366 --> 29:30.436
we were all victims
of this hack,

29:30.469 --> 29:32.404
but, uh, one of our artists

29:32.438 --> 29:34.173
came under attack the most,

29:34.206 --> 29:36.108
and that artist is Tiana.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.609
MAN: We love you, Tiana!
But lucky for her,

29:37.643 --> 29:40.146
our new head of A&R,
Xavier Rosen,

29:40.179 --> 29:42.514
stayed two steps ahead
of the game and shut it down.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.350
(cheering)
That's right.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.421
Thanks to Xavier,
Stop clapping.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.858
Tiana's new single,

29:51.891 --> 29:53.525
"Starlight," is a hit,

29:53.559 --> 29:56.295
and already streaming
to huge numbers.

29:56.328 --> 30:00.099
So let's give the baddest
white boy in the game some love.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.701
(cheering)

30:04.170 --> 30:06.505
LUCIOUS:
And now without further ado,

30:06.538 --> 30:08.207
I want to welcome to the stage,

30:08.240 --> 30:11.677
as a special treat
for you loyal employees,

30:11.710 --> 30:15.714
it is a duet by two
of Empire's greatest artists,

30:15.747 --> 30:20.019
Nessa and Hakeem Lyon!

30:20.052 --> 30:21.620
(cheering)

30:21.653 --> 30:23.822
Girl, you look like you're
about to give somebody

30:23.856 --> 30:25.191
the business. Relax.
No.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.625
Relax.
Xavier took credit

30:26.658 --> 30:28.494
for my idea
and a song that I produced.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.529
He promised Cookie
that he was gonna...
Becky, Becky...

30:30.562 --> 30:31.898
Come on, not here.
Come on, that's not

30:31.931 --> 30:33.299
how you handle the
situation, Becky.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.201
What, I'm supposed to let
him get away with that?

30:35.234 --> 30:36.869
Who says he's
getting away with it?

30:36.903 --> 30:39.038
The one thing I know how
to do is handle a scumbag.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.040
And it's not by going
at him from the front.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.808
Okay? Rock with me.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.744
I'll teach you a little
something about true payback.

30:45.777 --> 30:47.846
Okay? Come on, trust me.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.416
Play along, play along.
Stop... stop clapping.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.052
(siren wailing in distance)

30:53.085 --> 30:55.087
(low panting)

30:56.855 --> 30:59.225
(sniffles softly)

31:01.560 --> 31:03.295
(trembling exhale)

31:06.598 --> 31:08.034
(exhales)

31:10.769 --> 31:12.771
(pill container rattles)

31:16.808 --> 31:18.644
(sighs)

31:20.279 --> 31:22.381
(recording): This is Philip.
Please leave a me...

31:22.414 --> 31:23.382
(beeps)

31:23.415 --> 31:25.884
(takes deep breath)

31:33.592 --> 31:35.427
(recording):
Hey. It's D-Major.

31:35.461 --> 31:36.795
Leave it.
(beeps)

31:36.828 --> 31:39.065
Yo, Derek. Um...

31:41.333 --> 31:43.202
You know, I'm not doing so well.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.736
I...

31:44.770 --> 31:46.705
I think you were right.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.308
I'm just gonna take one of
these pills, 'cause it's not...

31:50.742 --> 31:53.845
Anyway, just call me
when you can, all right?

31:57.483 --> 32:00.052
J-Just come over.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.520
Please.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.256
(beeps)

32:11.130 --> 32:12.965
(glass shatters)

32:13.865 --> 32:16.835
(crowd cheering)

32:16.868 --> 32:19.405
* Hey, hey, hey, boy

32:19.438 --> 32:21.273
What's good, baby?
* Yeah

32:21.307 --> 32:22.674
* Yeah, you ready?
* Ah

32:22.708 --> 32:24.943
* Yeah, yeah
Let me get in this race, we out.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.645
(whooping)
* Come on

32:26.678 --> 32:28.014
* Girl, you know
I'm all about ya *

32:28.047 --> 32:29.448
* You need anything,
I got ya *

32:29.481 --> 32:31.083
* Just don't wanna be

32:31.117 --> 32:32.951
* That's one thing
I like about ya *

32:32.985 --> 32:34.253
* I want you to be
my ryda *

32:34.286 --> 32:35.988
* I know you been
thinkin' 'bout it *

32:36.022 --> 32:37.856
* Girl, I'm gonna
make you mine *

32:37.889 --> 32:39.358
* Guess there's
just no way around it *

32:39.391 --> 32:40.826
* Yeah, you're, you're, you're

32:40.859 --> 32:42.328
* You're the type I think
I could spend my life with *

32:42.361 --> 32:44.130
* All right
* I'm sure it's way more

32:44.163 --> 32:45.931
* More than something that
just lasts for a night *
* Oh, boy

32:45.964 --> 32:47.699
* And I'll cut them
chicks off real quick *
* Uh-huh

32:47.733 --> 32:49.268
* They ain't who I'm trying
to deal with *
* Uh-huh

32:49.301 --> 32:50.936
* You the one I
wanna chill with *
* Yeah

32:50.969 --> 32:52.338
* You got something
I could build with *

32:52.371 --> 32:54.940
* You say you want it

32:54.973 --> 32:56.975
* So show me

32:57.009 --> 32:58.377
* You do
* I do

32:58.410 --> 33:00.012
* Yeah
* Tell me

33:00.046 --> 33:02.848
* If it's really true

33:02.881 --> 33:05.817
* Yeah, I don't want
nobody else but you *

33:05.851 --> 33:07.786
* You tell me you about it then
can you show me if it's true *

33:07.819 --> 33:10.522
* It's true
* I see you talking
about all these things *

33:10.556 --> 33:11.823
* You say you wanna do
(whoops)

33:11.857 --> 33:13.059
* You wanna make me your ryda

33:13.092 --> 33:14.460
* Because you like
the way I move *

33:14.493 --> 33:15.827
* You say that you got me,
you're down for me,

33:15.861 --> 33:17.663
* I'm down for you

33:17.696 --> 33:19.498
* I'm down for you
* You tell me you about it

33:19.531 --> 33:21.167
* Then can you show me
if it's true *

33:21.200 --> 33:23.335
* I see you talking about
all these things *

33:23.369 --> 33:24.970
* You say you wanna do
* Let's do it

33:25.003 --> 33:27.873
* You wanna make me your ryda
'cause you like the way I move *

33:27.906 --> 33:29.808
* Well, if you say that you
got me, you're down for me *

33:29.841 --> 33:31.710
* I'm down for you
* I'm down for you

33:31.743 --> 33:35.414
* I got what you been feenin'

33:35.447 --> 33:38.384
* I don't want nobody else
but you *

33:38.417 --> 33:41.987
NESSA:
* Come show me if you mean it

33:42.020 --> 33:45.124
HAKEEM:
* I don't want
nobody else but you. *

33:46.192 --> 33:49.261
*

34:00.306 --> 34:02.408
*

34:31.237 --> 34:32.571
That's hot.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.142
(laughing): Derek, I've been
racking my brain

34:36.175 --> 34:38.244
about what the concept
of this album will be,

34:38.277 --> 34:41.079
and I swear, it hit
me... like-like...

34:41.113 --> 34:42.381
like a bolt of lightning.
You understand?

34:42.414 --> 34:43.582
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
You understand?

34:43.615 --> 34:45.117
Like a bolt of
lightning. It's...

34:45.151 --> 34:46.918
it's about my family.

34:46.952 --> 34:47.953
The secrets,

34:47.986 --> 34:48.954
the dirty little secrets,

34:48.987 --> 34:49.955
the dirty little secrets.

34:49.988 --> 34:51.623
(laughs)
I'm not just talking

34:51.657 --> 34:53.325
about the-the-the bad ones.

34:53.359 --> 34:54.460
Know what I'm saying?
Because everybody expects

34:54.493 --> 34:55.594
to-to hear that,
you know what I'm saying?

34:55.627 --> 34:57.429
I'm talking about
the good ones, too.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.930
These beautiful,
beautiful secrets

34:58.964 --> 35:00.166
that we hide, and if they...

35:00.199 --> 35:01.400
if they keep hidden...

35:01.433 --> 35:03.169
(laughs)
they're just gonna curl up

35:03.202 --> 35:04.770
and they're gonna die inside.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.071
But nah.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.773
I'm gonna put it all
in the music.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.108
I'm gonna set us all free.
All of us.

35:10.142 --> 35:12.411
And that's the light.
That's the light.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.079
That's the new direction?

35:14.112 --> 35:15.781
That's our new direction.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.416
(chuckles)
Yeah.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.684
You feelin' it?

35:18.717 --> 35:21.019
Yeah, I'm diggin' it.

35:21.052 --> 35:23.455
Yeah? Really?

35:23.489 --> 35:25.324
And I'm feeling it.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.226
Yeah.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.296
I'm feeling you.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.199
Yeah?

35:33.232 --> 35:34.866
Mm-hmm.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.886
HUGHES:
Whoever hacked them gave us

35:54.920 --> 35:57.022
a hell of a Christmas present.

35:57.055 --> 35:59.958
But, damn, I'm a little
cross-eyed over here.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.627
TARIQ:
I hear you.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.995
Let's call it a night.

36:04.029 --> 36:06.298
I got to give
it to him.

36:06.332 --> 36:07.999
Half his employees
hate his guts,

36:08.033 --> 36:10.001
the other half
think he's a god,

36:10.035 --> 36:12.371
and half his artists
are completely insane,

36:12.404 --> 36:15.073
but Lucious Lyon runs
a pretty tight ship.

36:15.106 --> 36:17.209
So did Stalin, my man.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.646
Wait. This is interesting.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.013
What is it?

36:22.047 --> 36:23.715
This is dated two days
after the day

36:23.749 --> 36:25.851
Frank Gathers was found
murdered in prison.

36:25.884 --> 36:28.153
"For MM: $53,800.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.889
For BK: $94,452."

36:30.922 --> 36:32.924
Seems MM and BK

36:32.958 --> 36:35.193
must have done something
for Lucious and got paid.

36:36.428 --> 36:39.431
Question is, who is MM and BK,

36:39.465 --> 36:41.933
and what exactly did they do?
(chuckles)

36:50.309 --> 36:51.610
Hey.

36:51.643 --> 36:54.112
You hungry?

36:54.145 --> 36:56.615
I'm starving.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.884
(chuckles)

37:08.760 --> 37:10.762
Jamal?

37:10.796 --> 37:12.898
Hey,

37:12.931 --> 37:15.133
what's wrong?

37:15.166 --> 37:17.436
Hey, stop playing, man.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.538
Hey.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.106
Hey, Jamal,

37:21.139 --> 37:22.441
wake up!

37:22.474 --> 37:24.209
Hey!

37:24.242 --> 37:25.877
Wake up!

37:25.911 --> 37:28.046
Hey, Jamal, wake up.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.781
Stop playing.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.250
That's not funny.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.590
(panting)

37:41.660 --> 37:42.828
(beeps)

37:42.861 --> 37:44.129
(recording):
This is Philip.

37:44.162 --> 37:45.597
Please leave a message.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.899
I need you to get over here
right now.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.602
I think Jamal O.D.'d.

37:50.636 --> 37:51.837
(phone beeps off)

37:51.870 --> 37:53.739
Oh, come on, baby.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.241
No, no, no, no,
you ain't going out like this.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.943
Come on.
Come on, baby.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.178
Come on, baby.

38:00.211 --> 38:02.180
Hey!

38:08.354 --> 38:09.855
Did you call an ambulance?

38:09.888 --> 38:11.757
Man, I didn't want it
to get on the blogs.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.392
He's breathing.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.362
Why couldn't I get a pulse?

38:16.395 --> 38:18.163
'Cause it's faint.
But it's there.

38:18.196 --> 38:20.198
He didn't overdose;
he blacked out.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.403
Wh-What you doing with him?

38:43.054 --> 38:44.356
Are you insane? What is this!

38:44.390 --> 38:45.591
(Jamal panting)

38:48.159 --> 38:50.061
TV NEWSMAN: Sir, is it true
you're romantically involved

38:50.095 --> 38:52.664
with Cookie Lyon?
ANGELO:
Uh, I'm not answering questions.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.666
Are you denying Cookie Lyon
sent you that photograph?

38:54.700 --> 38:56.368
That's none
of your damn business.

38:56.402 --> 38:57.803
That's none of your business.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.705
NEWSWOMAN: Cookie's cookies
You tell 'em, Angelo!

38:59.738 --> 39:00.872
are being leaked
all over the world.

39:00.906 --> 39:01.873
Why is it that you're entitled

39:01.907 --> 39:02.908
to a right to privacy

39:02.941 --> 39:04.643
when Ms. Lyon isn't?
Yeah,

39:04.676 --> 39:06.044
First off, everyone is entitled
why is that, Mr. Mayor?

39:06.077 --> 39:07.546
to the right to privacy.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.047
All right, y'all want
to know the deal?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.181
I'm gonna tell you the deal.

39:10.215 --> 39:11.817
(clears throat)
Yes...

39:11.850 --> 39:14.420
I was trying to date Ms. Lyon.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.354
Uh, she kept me
at arm's length,

39:16.388 --> 39:19.391
and just as I was about
to get somewhere with her,

39:19.425 --> 39:21.026
you guys messed that up.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.495
Uh, to be honest,
she just broke up with me today.

39:23.529 --> 39:24.996
So are we good now?

39:25.030 --> 39:26.832
Now, can we start dealing
with the real issues

39:26.865 --> 39:28.033
that New York City's people

39:28.066 --> 39:29.701
have to deal with?
You don't think

39:29.735 --> 39:32.938
the invasion of a woman's
privacy is important?

39:35.373 --> 39:36.908
NEWSMAN:
Are you gonna answer?

39:36.942 --> 39:38.744
You know what,
you're right.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.112
Um...

39:41.146 --> 39:45.216
this is but one of many examples

39:45.250 --> 39:48.086
of women being disrespected
in today's society.

39:48.119 --> 39:49.555
You all know that

39:49.588 --> 39:50.922
women's equality is...

39:50.956 --> 39:52.891
high up on my priority list,

39:52.924 --> 39:54.125
so...

39:54.159 --> 39:56.294
I'm gonna put myself out there,

39:56.327 --> 39:57.729
in solidarity,

39:57.763 --> 39:59.531
alongside Ms. Lyon

39:59.565 --> 40:00.799
and women everywhere.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.300
Is this enough for y'all?

40:02.333 --> 40:05.303
Or do you need me
to take off my pants, too?

40:05.336 --> 40:07.205
(laughs):
Yes! Yes! You go!

40:07.238 --> 40:10.208
Take it all off!

40:10.241 --> 40:12.644
I love you, Angelo.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.418
(liquid dripping)

40:22.120 --> 40:24.490
NESSA:
What is this place, Dre?

40:24.523 --> 40:25.657
(Andre chuckles softly)

40:25.691 --> 40:29.127
Chateau Andre.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.529
Come on.

40:40.205 --> 40:42.207
Come here.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.176
You wait here.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.612
Don't make a sound.
Dre...

40:46.645 --> 40:48.814
I'm gonna show you
how much I trust you.

41:04.029 --> 41:06.431
Well, well, well,

41:06.464 --> 41:07.432
look who's here.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.500
Vaughn, my man.

41:09.501 --> 41:10.936
(chuckles)

41:10.969 --> 41:13.271
Everything went more or less
exactly as planned,

41:13.304 --> 41:16.141
except for that part where you
leaked a nude selfie of my mama.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.709
VAUGHN: Man, I apologize
about that.

41:17.743 --> 41:19.711
I thought it would
add a little layer

41:19.745 --> 41:20.946
of plausible
deniability, you know?

41:20.979 --> 41:22.514
Yeah.
Nothing personal.

41:22.548 --> 41:24.616
Didn't jeopardize
the company, brother.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.818
If anything,
it got us more notice,

41:26.852 --> 41:29.555
so... I'll let it pass.

41:29.588 --> 41:33.324
But in the future, everything
goes through me, right?

41:34.359 --> 41:36.061
I heard you were president now.

41:36.094 --> 41:39.230
Big man on campus.
Oh, yeah.

41:39.264 --> 41:40.999
Soon as the service is worth
billions, I'll cut it loose,

41:41.032 --> 41:42.067
you get your
next installment.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.902
VAUGHN:
Mind if I double-check?

41:43.935 --> 41:45.704
All right?
Nothing personal, right?

41:45.737 --> 41:47.706
Can't trust nobody nowadays.

41:47.739 --> 41:50.308
Well, you can always trust
a Lyon, baby.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.143
This is why I am here.

41:52.177 --> 41:54.312
Now, you stay black,
my brother.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.314
(chuckles)
Stay strong.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.116
(chuckles)

42:06.391 --> 42:08.560
I created a void that
only I could fill.

42:08.594 --> 42:12.363
I knew my father would put me
in a position of power.

42:12.397 --> 42:14.499
So, what do you plan to do
with your power?

42:14.532 --> 42:16.602
(sighs)

42:16.635 --> 42:20.105
No matter how much I try
and play by the rules...

42:20.138 --> 42:24.242
the world's always gonna see
me as a well-dressed thug.

42:24.275 --> 42:26.377
The son of a gangster.

42:26.411 --> 42:29.948
So if that's the way
the world sees me...

42:29.981 --> 42:31.917
Rhonda always said
the only thing

42:31.950 --> 42:35.220
that was standing in the way
of me taking over Empire

42:35.253 --> 42:38.757
was I'm the son
that's not musical.

42:38.790 --> 42:40.626
But you...

42:42.594 --> 42:44.229
...you, you're...

42:44.262 --> 42:46.765
you're the embodiment
of music, Nessa.

42:48.099 --> 42:50.802
I think that Rhonda
would approve.

42:50.836 --> 42:53.538
Of you becoming a gangster?

42:53.571 --> 42:55.106
Of us...

42:56.608 --> 42:59.244
...combining our strengths

42:59.277 --> 43:01.980
and becoming powerful together.

43:02.013 --> 43:03.649
Powerful.

43:03.682 --> 43:05.283
(whispers):
Yeah.

43:06.317 --> 43:08.153
All-powerful.

43:59.037 --> 44:01.039
Yeah.

-Last night's winning Lotto.
-The number of cats
in your apartment.

44:16.054 --> 44:20.859
It's the amount of money
you two cost the city
working together for three days.

44:20.892 --> 44:23.494
You've been on the job 25 years.
Not a nick on you.

You get partnered with Riggs
