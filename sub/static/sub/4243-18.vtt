WEBVTT

00:00.398 --> 00:03.333
I hold in my hand,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:03.367 --> 00:06.902
our competition for regionals.

00:08.339 --> 00:10.873
Drumroll, please.

00:10.907 --> 00:12.875
From...

00:12.909 --> 00:13.409
North Central High School
in Indianapolis,

00:13.444 --> 00:15.911
the Hoosierdaddies.

00:15.945 --> 00:17.846
That's very clever.
And from Our Lady

00:17.881 --> 00:19.482
of Perpetual Loneliness
in Battle Creek, Michigan,

00:20.516 --> 00:21.650
the Nun-Touchables.

00:21.684 --> 00:23.152
<i>Wait, is that a convent?</i>

00:23.187 --> 00:25.488
Guys, I like our chances
against both these squads,

00:26.522 --> 00:27.990
but we still got a
lot of work to do.

00:27.024 --> 00:29.858
Mr. Shue, please stop talking.
I have an announcement.

00:29.893 --> 00:31.927
I regret to inform you

00:31.961 --> 00:33.296
a deadly asteroid
is headed our way.

00:36.799 --> 00:39.068
Wait, didn't we just go
through this at Christmas?

00:39.103 --> 00:40.270
Yeah, and is it true

00:40.304 --> 00:42.105
you and Sam got married?
Did that happen?

00:42.139 --> 00:44.107
Shut up, Tina.
I'm naming this comet.

00:44.141 --> 00:47.576
Tubbington-Bopp, and it is
headed straight for Lima.

00:47.610 --> 00:49.212
Wait, so is it an asteroid or a comet?
It's both.

00:49.246 --> 00:51.080
Wouldn't NASA know something
about this?

00:51.115 --> 00:53.049
We can't trust NASA.
I mean, last month

00:53.083 --> 00:55.717
a meteor exactly
like Tubbington-Bopp

00:55.752 --> 00:57.020
hit Russia with no warning at all.
Oh, so now it's a meteor.

00:57.054 --> 00:59.588
That's right, Artie,
And when this meteorite hits,

00:59.622 --> 01:01.556
I will not be spending my time

01:01.591 --> 01:02.058
in this room preparing
for regionals.

01:02.092 --> 01:05.260
I will be spending my last hours
making amends with somebody who

01:05.296 --> 01:06.429
I need to get right with.

01:06.463 --> 01:08.197
Someone who I love very much.

01:08.232 --> 01:11.767
Lord Tubbington.

01:11.801 --> 01:12.235
So go back to your homes
and hide your wife,

01:12.269 --> 01:14.437
hide your kids
and hide your wife.

01:14.471 --> 01:16.139
McKinley High, I salute you.

01:24.814 --> 01:26.782
I'm really surprised
that Jesus Christ Superstar

01:26.816 --> 01:27.383
has chosen to end the world
this way instead of the way

01:27.418 --> 01:28.384
he killed off the dinosaurs,

01:28.419 --> 01:30.886
which was a global
yeast infection.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.522
Do you think God will let me
be a girl angel in heaven?

01:33.556 --> 01:34.123
Wait, there are girl
and boy angels?

01:34.158 --> 01:36.225
Does that mean
you can have angel sex?

01:36.260 --> 01:38.294
All right. Show of hands.

01:38.329 --> 01:40.562
Who's worried about.

01:40.596 --> 01:44.566
Brittany's meteor/asteroid/comet
prediction?

01:44.600 --> 01:46.902
Okay. Well, here's how I see it.

01:46.936 --> 01:48.570
There are two possible outcomes.

01:48.604 --> 01:51.606
First, the meteor misses us
and we go to regionals

01:51.641 --> 01:54.210
and we kick butt, which will
only happen if we prepare.

01:54.244 --> 01:58.880
Or... we only have
a few days to live

01:58.915 --> 02:00.716
and if that's the case,

02:00.750 --> 02:01.484
we need to say everything
we need to say

02:02.518 --> 02:03.319
to the people we love.

02:03.354 --> 02:05.154
I can tell you
from those couple of weeks

02:05.189 --> 02:07.490
where I couldn't talk to Emma
that there is nothing worse

02:08.524 --> 02:10.658
than unfinished business
with the one you love.

02:10.693 --> 02:11.327
And meteor or no meteor

02:11.362 --> 02:14.696
any moment you have
with those people

02:14.731 --> 02:16.631
might be your last one.

02:16.666 --> 02:18.134
Bruce Springsteen always says

02:18.168 --> 02:21.536
that he plays every show
as if it's his last,

02:21.571 --> 02:24.107
and that is the kind of urgency
we need at regionals this year.

02:24.141 --> 02:26.109
So this week

02:26.143 --> 02:29.811
we're either gonna sing
our last songs to each other

02:29.846 --> 02:34.683
or get in touch with what it
feels like to do that.

02:35.052 --> 02:37.853
Okay, everyone.

02:37.887 --> 02:38.987
Let's make the most of it.

02:38.022 --> 02:40.989
Dude. Dude, I saw her.

02:40.024 --> 02:42.891
She goes here. I can't
believe the coincidence.

02:42.925 --> 02:44.726
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.
Saw who?

02:44.761 --> 02:46.728
Her. Katie.

02:46.763 --> 02:48.730
Okay, listen,
I haven't told you

02:48.765 --> 02:49.298
'cause it's a little
embarrassing,

02:49.333 --> 02:51.967
but I've been having
this text-lationship

02:51.001 --> 02:53.535
with this girl I met online.

02:53.569 --> 02:55.537
She's funny, she's smart,
she totally gets me,

02:55.571 --> 02:57.539
but I figured she lived, like,
halfway across the country

02:57.573 --> 02:58.374
or something and I'd have
to steal my mom's Volvo

02:58.409 --> 03:00.376
for a spring break roadie to God
knows where just to meet her.

03:00.411 --> 03:02.677
But just this morning...

03:02.712 --> 03:04.679
<i>I was taking</i>
<i>that English test on</i> 1984,

03:04.714 --> 03:06.515
<i>getting totally frustrated</i>
<i>about how I'm supposed to write</i>

03:06.549 --> 03:08.683
<i>an essay on the dystopian</i>
<i>future when the book is set,</i>

03:08.718 --> 03:09.419
<i>like, 13 years</i>
<i>before I was even born.</i>

03:09.453 --> 03:11.387
<i>And then I looked up</i>
<i>to clear my head</i>

03:11.422 --> 03:13.588
<i>and there she was.</i>

03:13.623 --> 03:16.758
d There is one in a million
like you d

03:16.793 --> 03:18.061
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

03:18.095 --> 03:20.229
<i>I thought I was hallucinating,</i>
<i>but she looked right back at me</i>

03:20.264 --> 03:22.731
<i>as she walked by.</i>
<i>It was definitely her.</i>

03:22.765 --> 03:25.368
<i>I tried to get up</i>
<i>and go after her, but...</i>

03:25.402 --> 03:27.370
I think I'm in love
with this girl.

03:27.404 --> 03:30.539
Dude,
you've got to slow down.

03:30.573 --> 03:31.040
You haven't even met her yet.

03:31.075 --> 03:33.775
It's like I've more
than met her, okay?

03:33.810 --> 03:36.945
Without all the awkwardness
of looks or clothes or hairdos,

03:36.979 --> 03:39.614
we really got to know
each other. On the real.

03:39.649 --> 03:41.616
I've got to meet her.

03:41.651 --> 03:43.086
I think I'm gonna skip next hour
and just go class to class,

03:43.120 --> 03:45.687
looking in the windows
until I find her.

03:45.721 --> 03:47.722
Okay, and then what?
You can't just walk

03:47.757 --> 03:49.558
into the middle of some class.
You can't wait for her

03:49.592 --> 03:51.560
in the hall and say,
"Hi, I'm in love with you."

03:51.594 --> 03:52.428
You need some kind of a plan.

03:52.463 --> 03:54.896
And it has to be special.

03:56.766 --> 03:58.567
Lord Tubbington,

03:58.601 --> 04:00.236
I know that through the years
we haven't always gotten along.

04:00.270 --> 04:04.573
Like the time that you filed
paperwork to have me committed

04:04.607 --> 04:06.608
or the time you told the police
that I was the one

04:06.642 --> 04:08.910
that brutally murdered
that whole family of mice.

04:08.945 --> 04:10.912
But I want you to know

04:10.947 --> 04:12.514
that through it all,

04:12.548 --> 04:13.116
I always loved you.

04:13.150 --> 04:15.784
I don't think he believes me.

04:15.818 --> 04:17.952
'Cause he won't say
that he loves me, too.

04:17.987 --> 04:20.589
What's Lord Tubbington's
favorite song? I mean, maybe...

04:20.623 --> 04:22.225
you could let him know how much he
means to you by singing it to him.

04:22.259 --> 04:24.793
Well, I stopped singing to
Lord Tubbington out of protest

04:24.827 --> 04:27.762
when he joined the KKKK, which
is the Ku Klux Klan for Kats.

04:27.797 --> 04:28.064
You know, you could bring him by

04:28.098 --> 04:29.432
and then we could
all sing to him.

04:29.466 --> 04:31.766
That way, you know,
he'll see how much

04:31.801 --> 04:32.435
you love him, and everybody
else in the glee club

04:32.469 --> 04:35.937
will stop feeling like you're
choosing a cat over them.

04:35.972 --> 04:38.940
Sam, despite your outlandishly
low test scores,

04:38.975 --> 04:40.575
you're a genius.

04:48.452 --> 04:50.086
H-Hey.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.754
How you doing?

04:52.788 --> 04:53.456
Me?

04:53.490 --> 04:55.757
Yeah, you. I've been
dying to talk to you.

04:55.791 --> 04:57.093
Seriously?

04:57.127 --> 04:58.461
Yeah.

04:58.495 --> 05:00.829
I saw you walk by my class
this morning and I almost

05:00.863 --> 05:02.664
ran out of a test
to come meet you.

05:02.698 --> 05:04.333
I'm kind of freaking
out right now. That's cool.

05:04.368 --> 05:07.270
So am I. Uh, sorry. I should
really do this properly.

05:07.304 --> 05:08.437
I'm Ryder Lynn.

05:08.472 --> 05:10.206
Yeah. Yeah, I know who you are.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.241
Would you mind coming with me?

05:15.412 --> 05:17.846
Hey, how you doing?

05:17.880 --> 05:19.514
What is happening?

05:19.549 --> 05:20.715
And...

05:21.751 --> 05:23.386
...who are they?

05:23.420 --> 05:26.222
They're the band.

05:26.256 --> 05:29.558
And...
Oh, my... God.

05:29.592 --> 05:30.859
If I know you
the way I think I do,

05:30.893 --> 05:32.894
you're gonna love it
even more after.

05:40.270 --> 05:44.073
d It's a little bit funny d

05:44.107 --> 05:48.510
d This feeling inside d

05:48.544 --> 05:50.012
d I'm not one of those d

05:50.047 --> 05:55.017

06:02.292 --> 06:06.262

06:12.236 --> 06:16.771

06:16.806 --> 06:19.608

06:24.747 --> 06:27.116

07:38.121 --> 07:43.259

07:45.462 --> 07:49.098
Okay, you are such a good
singer, and your arms

07:49.132 --> 07:51.666
are, like, so hunky.

07:51.701 --> 07:53.402
I'm literally dying.

07:53.437 --> 07:56.604
Uh, but... why me?

07:56.639 --> 07:58.174
After all the time we've spent
getting to know each other

07:58.208 --> 08:00.343
on Facebook and-and IM-ing
and texting,

08:00.377 --> 08:03.678
I just... I wanted
the first time we met in person

08:03.713 --> 08:05.513
to be something we remembered
for the rest of our lives.

08:05.548 --> 08:08.717
Okay, but we haven't been doing
any of those things.

08:08.751 --> 08:09.385
Yeah, we have.

08:09.419 --> 08:12.154
The last few weeks, we've
told each other everything.

08:12.189 --> 08:14.056
All our secrets, our dreams.

08:14.091 --> 08:17.992
Come on, Katie, you don't have
to be embarrassed.

08:17.027 --> 08:19.828
But my name's not Katie.
It's Marissa.

08:19.862 --> 08:21.397
No. No, I, um...

08:21.431 --> 08:24.899
Look. See? Uh...

08:24.934 --> 08:25.301
here are all our texts,

08:25.335 --> 08:27.303
and that's a picture
you sent me of yourself.

08:27.337 --> 08:31.740
Well, yeah, that's my picture,
but I didn't send it to you.

08:31.774 --> 08:34.842
I-I never wrote
any of those texts.

08:34.876 --> 08:37.578
Oh, my God.
Someone's catfishing you.

08:37.613 --> 08:38.179
It happened to Manti Te'o.

08:38.215 --> 08:41.683
Someone stole a picture of me

08:41.717 --> 08:44.686
and used it created a fake
identity to get close to you.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.688
Who the hell would do
something like that?

08:46.722 --> 08:49.691
I'm so sorry, Ryder.

08:49.725 --> 08:52.727
But please... please call me.

09:06.188 --> 09:10.988
Hey! Hey!

09:10.023 --> 09:13.658
- Hey, which one of you was it?
- Whoa, dude. Dude.

09:13.692 --> 09:15.660
It was you, wasn't it? What are you doing?
You need to calm down.

09:15.694 --> 09:17.829
Stringing me along online,
pretending to be somebody else,

09:17.863 --> 09:20.832
getting me to send you...
pictures?

09:20.866 --> 09:22.900
Because you still like me
and this is your warped way

09:22.935 --> 09:24.669
of showing it? Well, that's
messed up, Marley. Ryder,

09:24.703 --> 09:27.106
I swear to you, it-it...
This is not me.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.574
Then it was you.

09:29.608 --> 09:30.309
Dude, I wouldn't
do something like this.

09:30.343 --> 09:33.978
You know, I get it, all right?

09:33.012 --> 09:36.647
I get it that you didn't
like me back.

09:36.682 --> 09:37.116
I get it that I crossed
the line,

09:37.150 --> 09:40.752
but you didn't have
to humiliate me.

09:40.786 --> 09:43.288
You didn't have
to make me feel so pathetic.

09:43.323 --> 09:45.290
I thought you were still
my friends.

09:45.325 --> 09:48.327
I swear to you
we did not do this.

09:50.029 --> 09:52.498
Well, it had to be somebody
close to me, all right?

09:53.532 --> 09:55.666
Somebody who knew exactly what
to say to get me to trust them.

09:55.701 --> 09:57.835
Do you want to talk about it?

09:57.870 --> 09:59.604
I don't want
anything from anyone.

09:59.638 --> 10:00.005
Especially not either of you.

10:00.039 --> 10:01.173
Dude.

10:01.207 --> 10:03.208
Dude.

10:04.210 --> 10:08.513
Wow.
Whoa.

10:18.857 --> 10:21.493
d Saying I love you d

10:22.528 --> 10:24.029
d Is not the words d

10:24.063 --> 10:28.033
d I want to hear from you d

10:28.067 --> 10:32.037
d It's not that I want you d

10:32.071 --> 10:38.477
d Not to say,
but if you only knew d

10:39.511 --> 10:42.481
d How easy d

10:43.515 --> 10:48.220
d It would be to show me
how you feel d

10:48.254 --> 10:53.691
d More than words d

10:53.725 --> 10:56.361
d Is all you have to do d

10:56.396 --> 10:59.864
d To make it real d

10:59.898 --> 11:01.099
d Then you wouldn't d

11:01.134 --> 11:04.403
d Have to say d

11:04.437 --> 11:08.440
d That you love me d

11:08.475 --> 11:15.613
d 'Cause I'd already know d

11:15.647 --> 11:20.785
d <i>What would you do</i> d

11:20.819 --> 11:25.224
d If my heart was torn in two d

11:25.258 --> 11:27.459
d More than words d

11:27.494 --> 11:30.595
d To show you feel d

11:30.629 --> 11:36.634
d That your love
for me is real d

11:36.668 --> 11:40.405
d <i>What would you say</i> d

11:40.440 --> 11:43.574
d If I took d

11:43.609 --> 11:46.577
d Those words away d

11:46.612 --> 11:51.283
d Then you couldn't
make things new d

11:51.317 --> 11:53.151
d Just by saying d

11:53.186 --> 11:56.088
d I love... d

11:56.122 --> 12:01.260
d You. d

12:20.679 --> 12:22.680
What is this?

12:22.714 --> 12:23.748
A little din-din,

12:23.782 --> 12:26.584
inspired by one of
our favorite movies.

12:26.618 --> 12:27.752
<i>The Godfather?</i>

12:27.786 --> 12:28.920
<i>Lady and the Tramp.</i>

12:28.954 --> 12:29.087
Oh.

12:29.122 --> 12:30.322
Oh.
Mmm.

12:30.356 --> 12:31.490
Come sit down.

12:32.524 --> 12:33.658
This looks great.

12:33.692 --> 12:34.825
Right here.

12:34.860 --> 12:35.160
I mean, what-what's
this all about?

12:35.194 --> 12:37.995
Well, as you've heard,

12:37.030 --> 12:39.830
that Tubbington-Bopp's
getting close to Earth.

12:39.865 --> 12:41.666
Oh.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.168
And if it hits,
we're all gonna be deader

12:43.202 --> 12:45.470
than a bunch of baby chickens
fighting a dachshund.

12:46.505 --> 12:49.674
So, I figured if I had
one more week upright,

12:49.708 --> 12:50.409
I wanted to do
something special

12:50.443 --> 12:52.344
with my most special friend.

12:52.378 --> 12:54.745
Well, that is very lovely.

12:54.780 --> 12:55.147
Thank you so much.

12:55.181 --> 12:57.915
And, hey, why worry about carbs

12:57.950 --> 12:59.617
when we're all gonna die anyway?

12:59.651 --> 13:00.952
Hello.
Hello.

13:00.986 --> 13:02.187
So, I heard about your, uh,

13:02.221 --> 13:04.855
glee lesson.

13:04.890 --> 13:06.158
About last chances
and finally saying

13:06.192 --> 13:08.759
everything you want to say.

13:08.794 --> 13:09.027
Yeah, I think that

13:09.062 --> 13:11.196
the kids are really
taking to it. Mmm.

13:11.230 --> 13:13.831
This is delicious.

13:13.865 --> 13:15.933
I boiled the pasta
in the hot tub

13:15.968 --> 13:16.134
in the training room.

13:16.169 --> 13:18.936
I-I changed the water first.

13:18.971 --> 13:20.005
But there is something
about that thing

13:20.039 --> 13:22.374
that just gives it
the perfect al dente.

13:22.408 --> 13:24.875
All right.

13:24.910 --> 13:26.345
So, anyway...

13:26.379 --> 13:28.980
Oh, man.

13:28.014 --> 13:30.048
I have punched a charging hippo

13:30.083 --> 13:31.216
square in the face,

13:31.250 --> 13:34.353
and not been as scared
as I am right now.

13:34.387 --> 13:36.721
Talk to me.
What-what is going on?

13:36.755 --> 13:38.723
You are the...
the first guy

13:38.757 --> 13:41.659
that was ever willing
to kiss me.

13:41.693 --> 13:42.294
The first one that...

13:42.328 --> 13:44.229
ever made me feel like a girl.

13:44.263 --> 13:47.232
I am proud to have been
that man in your life.

13:50.869 --> 13:51.169
Whoa.

13:51.204 --> 13:54.439
I want you to be
the man in my life.

13:54.474 --> 13:57.376
For the first time
since we've known each other,

13:57.410 --> 14:00.312
we're both single.

14:02.081 --> 14:03.415
Oh, please...

14:03.449 --> 14:05.117
say something.

14:05.151 --> 14:07.352
I...

14:07.387 --> 14:09.221
If you don't,
I'm-I'm gonna die.

14:09.255 --> 14:11.223
Shannon...

14:11.257 --> 14:13.425
Emma and I are back together.

14:13.459 --> 14:15.193
I've been meaning
to tell you about it.

14:15.228 --> 14:17.262
I mean, we have been
for a week or so.

14:17.296 --> 14:19.464
I-I want you be happy
for me, and I-I...

14:19.499 --> 14:21.199
Let's just talk about this

14:21.234 --> 14:23.268
over this incredible dinner.

14:23.302 --> 14:25.103
I... I don't think I have
much of an appetite.

14:25.138 --> 14:26.304
I'm sorry.

14:26.339 --> 14:29.573
Shannon...

14:45.791 --> 14:46.824
Of course I'm mad...

15:21.860 --> 15:23.994
Esteemed members
of the Astronomy Club,

15:23.029 --> 15:24.329
I have an announcement.

15:24.363 --> 15:26.264
I have recently discovered that

15:26.299 --> 15:28.467
the Tubbington-Bopp
is not an asteroid.

15:29.501 --> 15:31.502
<i>It is a dead ladybug</i>

15:31.536 --> 15:33.504
<i>at the end of my telescope.</i>

15:33.538 --> 15:34.005
And I have also discovered

15:34.040 --> 15:36.441
that my telescope
is not a telescope.

15:38.444 --> 15:40.945
It is a Pringles can.

15:40.979 --> 15:43.348
Hallelujah, we're saved.

15:43.382 --> 15:45.183
Oh, thank God.

15:45.218 --> 15:48.586
However, however, I...

15:48.620 --> 15:50.588
feel that I have disgraced
this fine institution

15:50.622 --> 15:52.790
and I am hereby disbanding
the Astronomy Club.

15:52.824 --> 15:54.292
What? This club
is my community service.

15:54.327 --> 15:57.129
Shine on, young astronomers,
and I guess good night.

15:57.163 --> 15:59.164
Forever.

15:59.198 --> 16:01.333
It's good news, we're alive.

16:04.903 --> 16:07.705
Can I talk to you for a second?

16:07.739 --> 16:08.306
Sure. What's up?

16:08.341 --> 16:10.308
The meteor made me realize

16:10.343 --> 16:13.145
that there is something
I really want to say to you.

16:13.179 --> 16:16.547
Brittany, I have always
looked up to you.

16:16.581 --> 16:18.883
Thank you, Becky.

16:18.917 --> 16:21.685
Let's both not ever graduate.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.221
The-the world out there
is really scary.

16:23.256 --> 16:25.856
Someday, they will

16:25.891 --> 16:27.892
make me leave here,

16:27.926 --> 16:29.227
and I don't know
what I'm going to do.

16:29.262 --> 16:31.229
Okay, but, Becky,
I can't stay here.

16:31.264 --> 16:34.698
I aced my SATs, which means

16:34.733 --> 16:35.066
that if I graduate,

16:35.101 --> 16:37.202
I can go to whatever college
I want to.

16:37.236 --> 16:40.704
But I can't go to college.

16:40.739 --> 16:41.239
Becky, I know it's scary.

16:41.274 --> 16:44.575
And it would be so cool

16:44.609 --> 16:45.243
to be a Cheerio again
with you next year.

16:45.278 --> 16:48.213
But I have to move on.

16:48.247 --> 16:50.714
And so do you.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.717
And if you really
prepare yourself,

16:53.752 --> 16:56.887
the world won't seem
like such a scary place.

16:57.089 --> 16:59.790
Pinkie promise.

16:59.825 --> 17:00.591
Pinkie promise that.

17:02.461 --> 17:04.895
I love you, Brittany.

17:04.930 --> 17:05.130
I love you, too.

17:08.464 --> 17:10.665
Hey, Will, you wanted to see me?

17:10.700 --> 17:12.767
We wanted you to join us

17:12.801 --> 17:13.102
for our first annual.

17:13.136 --> 17:15.171
"Thank God the World
Isn't Ending" glee practice.

17:15.204 --> 17:17.806
It's where I can throw
Junior Mints at Marley

17:17.839 --> 17:18.174
without feeling
bad about it again.

17:18.208 --> 17:19.175
Sit down.

17:19.209 --> 17:21.843
Mm, I don't know, Will.

17:21.877 --> 17:22.011
Come on, we're gonna
sing some songs,

17:22.045 --> 17:24.613
maybe bust out
a few dance moves.

17:24.646 --> 17:25.114
I may even rap.

17:25.147 --> 17:26.449
Okay.

17:26.483 --> 17:28.817
All right!

17:28.851 --> 17:29.951
Let's get started.

17:35.058 --> 17:37.360
Everyone just spread out
and hide, spread out and hide.

17:37.394 --> 17:39.527
Find a place to hide!

17:39.562 --> 17:40.196
Please, go over there.
No, wait...

18:05.355 --> 18:06.022
Are we even sure
those are gunshots?

18:06.056 --> 18:07.456
Shh!

18:20.237 --> 18:22.704
Here, hey, guys, guys, guys.

18:22.738 --> 18:24.273
Start texting, tweeting,

18:24.308 --> 18:26.442
let everyone know
what's going on.

18:26.476 --> 18:28.710
But don't tell them
we're here, all right?

18:28.744 --> 18:30.712
Shooters have smartphones, too.

18:31.914 --> 18:33.682
It's okay.

18:41.258 --> 18:42.325
Guys...

18:42.359 --> 18:46.961
we're all just gonna
stay here, okay?

18:46.996 --> 18:48.230
Got nowhere to be,
we don't know what's out there.

18:48.265 --> 18:51.434
Shh. Shh.

18:54.371 --> 18:57.239
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

18:57.274 --> 18:59.442
I love you guys.

19:22.332 --> 19:24.632
It's okay.

19:24.667 --> 19:25.700
Shh.

19:25.735 --> 19:27.535
It's okay.

19:27.570 --> 19:28.170
It's all right.

19:30.673 --> 19:31.040
Sam.
Sam.

19:31.074 --> 19:34.976
Sam. What are
you doing?

19:34.010 --> 19:36.379
Sam, get down. Get down. Get down.
I have to go.

19:36.413 --> 19:38.747
Brittany doesn't
have her phone on her.

19:38.781 --> 19:39.814
She's in the bathroom.
She left it here.

19:39.849 --> 19:40.282
Sam, Sam, sit down.

19:40.317 --> 19:42.451
Sam, sit down.

19:47.424 --> 19:50.859
Tina isn't here, either.

20:32.235 --> 20:35.770
Who are you texting?

20:35.805 --> 20:37.839
It's my mom.

20:39.409 --> 20:42.011
There's no back way out
when you're in the kitchen.

20:45.115 --> 20:47.349
It's
okay, it's okay.

20:47.384 --> 20:49.717
Where is she?

21:03.233 --> 21:06.835
I don't know why
she's not answering.

21:06.869 --> 21:07.036
She'll be okay.
No one's gonna hurt your mom.

21:08.371 --> 21:10.905
Everyone really likes her.

21:15.978 --> 21:16.345
Marley.

21:18.315 --> 21:19.482
When we were doing <i>Grease,</i>

21:20.516 --> 21:21.850
I took in all your costumes

21:21.884 --> 21:23.551
so that you'd think
you were fat.

21:26.589 --> 21:27.456
I'm so sorry.

21:35.098 --> 21:36.398
I have to go.

21:36.433 --> 21:38.700
Where are you going?
I have to go.

21:38.734 --> 21:39.734
No, are you crazy?

21:39.768 --> 21:40.735
Shh.

21:40.769 --> 21:41.970
Kitty.
Stay down.

21:41.004 --> 21:42.971
Kitty.

21:42.005 --> 21:44.839
Yes!
Kitty. Kitty.

21:44.874 --> 21:46.741
Kitty.

21:46.775 --> 21:48.643
Kitty. Stay down.

21:48.677 --> 21:49.111
Get down!

21:51.281 --> 21:53.915
Sam. Sam. I have to go.
I got to go.

21:53.949 --> 21:54.250
She's out there all alone, she
doesn't have anybody out there.

21:54.284 --> 21:55.251
Sam, no.
I have to go, I don't care.

21:55.285 --> 21:57.852
Come on, Sam.
I don't care.

21:57.887 --> 21:58.220
Come on, Sam!

21:58.255 --> 22:00.022
No, let go of me!
I'm going!

22:00.056 --> 22:01.423
Sam!

22:01.458 --> 22:03.259
Sam, listen!

22:03.293 --> 22:05.727
I don't care!
Shh!

22:05.761 --> 22:06.328
I don't care!

22:06.363 --> 22:08.696
Sam, listen.

22:08.731 --> 22:11.799
You are putting
everybody's life in danger.

22:11.834 --> 22:12.934
Look at them.

22:12.968 --> 22:13.102
Look at them.

22:13.136 --> 22:14.470
Look at them.

22:15.504 --> 22:17.639
Sam, it's okay.

22:17.673 --> 22:19.607
It's okay, Sam.

22:19.642 --> 22:20.109
Sam, go sit.
Go sit with Artie.

22:20.143 --> 22:23.811
Go sit with him.

22:57.213 --> 22:59.114
Shh.

22:59.149 --> 23:01.849
Ryder, what are you doing?

23:01.884 --> 23:02.351
Get down!

23:02.385 --> 23:05.853
What are you doing?

23:06.689 --> 23:08.690
What are you doing?

23:16.199 --> 23:19.667
Principal Figgins,
I need to go back in.

23:19.702 --> 23:20.868
It's Glee practice,

23:20.903 --> 23:21.036
and everyone is
in the choir room. I was late.

23:21.071 --> 23:23.705
No way. Not until
the police go in

23:23.739 --> 23:25.707
and give the all-clear!

23:28.411 --> 23:31.779
Artie, what are you doing?

23:31.814 --> 23:34.216
If we don't get out of
here, people need to see this.

23:37.553 --> 23:39.088
Does anybody have anything
they want to say?

23:39.122 --> 23:41.123
Yeah. Me.

23:48.998 --> 23:50.432
I love you, Dad.

23:50.467 --> 23:53.469
Thanks for, like... everything.

23:54.503 --> 23:56.038
And I know
I don't always let you know,

23:56.072 --> 23:58.173
but you've taught me a lot.

24:05.248 --> 24:08.450
There's a fake bottom...
to my desk drawer.

24:10.753 --> 24:12.121
If you look under it, um...

24:12.155 --> 24:16.891
there's a journal with a bunch
of songs that I wrote.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.596
I've never told anyone,
but I'm really proud of them.

24:26.002 --> 24:28.736
Uh...

24:28.771 --> 24:29.038
Mom, Puck...

24:29.072 --> 24:31.240
...I love you guys.

24:31.274 --> 24:34.909
You guys. Turn it off.

24:34.943 --> 24:35.377
Please turn it off.

24:35.412 --> 24:38.980
Sam...

25:04.007 --> 25:06.041
Brittany?

25:06.076 --> 25:09.677
Mr. Shue.

25:10.480 --> 25:12.281
Oh.

25:15.351 --> 25:16.485
It's okay.

25:20.190 --> 25:22.057
Everyone all right?

25:22.092 --> 25:25.461
I want to call her.

25:25.495 --> 25:27.662
Who?

25:27.696 --> 25:29.831
Katie.

25:29.865 --> 25:30.432
I thought you said
she was fake?

25:30.467 --> 25:32.468
Look, she's someone...

25:33.502 --> 25:35.503
and I still care
about her, okay?

25:37.040 --> 25:39.074
I'm calling her.
Yeah.

25:40.443 --> 25:43.745
Come on, pick up, pick up.

25:43.779 --> 25:46.748
Pick up, please. Please.

25:49.885 --> 25:50.018
Shh!

25:59.395 --> 26:02.663
Turn it off!

26:02.698 --> 26:04.932
Turn the phone off.
Shh.

26:04.967 --> 26:06.501
You guys find that phone,
and turn it off.

26:06.535 --> 26:07.602
Hang up.
Hang up the phone, Ryder.

26:07.636 --> 26:08.703
Hang up.
Hang up.

26:08.737 --> 26:09.204
Hang up... the phone.
Shh! Shh! Shut up!

26:09.239 --> 26:11.206
Hang up the phone.
Shh.

26:48.178 --> 26:50.812
All clear!

26:52.315 --> 26:54.549
Is everybody here?

26:54.583 --> 26:57.652
All clear!

26:57.686 --> 26:59.887
All clear!

26:59.922 --> 27:00.489
Oh, my God.

27:01.523 --> 27:02.690
All clear!

27:03.892 --> 27:05.360
All clear!

27:05.395 --> 27:08.729
My God.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.741
Come here.

27:20.776 --> 27:22.543
Come here. Come here. Come here.

27:22.578 --> 27:23.911
Where's Tina? You
guys get over here.

27:23.946 --> 27:24.079
You guys, come here.

27:24.113 --> 27:25.247
You kids, get in here.

27:25.281 --> 27:27.582
Come here.

27:27.616 --> 27:28.250
It's okay. It's okay.
We're all here.

27:30.119 --> 27:32.587
I love you all.

27:32.621 --> 27:33.088
I love you guys.

27:33.122 --> 27:36.225
Every one of you.

27:36.259 --> 27:38.260
You guys were awesome.

28:32.973 --> 28:34.640
Seriously?

28:37.944 --> 28:39.412
At the risk of
stepping out of character,

28:39.447 --> 28:42.249
I brought donuts to calm
everyone's frayed nerves,

28:42.283 --> 28:45.618
until some rent-a-cop
put his greasy palm prints

28:45.652 --> 28:46.052
all over my French crullers.

28:46.087 --> 28:48.788
Hmm. I don't mind.

28:48.822 --> 28:50.890
I'll never forget
the look on their faces

28:50.924 --> 28:52.825
when that gun went off.

28:52.859 --> 28:54.894
Something was taken from them...

28:54.928 --> 28:57.063
their innocence, their idealism,

28:57.098 --> 28:58.298
their feeling of safety.

28:58.332 --> 29:00.800
I just hope we get

29:00.834 --> 29:01.034
the students back.

29:01.068 --> 29:03.403
Half of them didn't
even show up today.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.238
Oh, my goodness,
I haven't seen this

29:05.273 --> 29:07.640
level of overreaction

29:07.674 --> 29:10.810
since Janet Jackson showed her
saggy fun bag at the Super Bowl.

29:10.844 --> 29:12.145
What if it wasn't even a gun?

29:12.180 --> 29:15.815
You ever think about that?
Cops didn't find one.

29:15.849 --> 29:16.816
It could just as easily
have been firecrackers,

29:16.850 --> 29:17.983
or a car backfiring.

29:17.018 --> 29:18.151
I grew up on a farm,

29:18.186 --> 29:20.086
and I know what
a gunshot sounds like.

29:20.121 --> 29:21.321
Somebody fired

29:21.355 --> 29:22.489
a gun in this school.

29:23.523 --> 29:25.091
And quite frankly,
I don't feel safe

29:25.126 --> 29:27.893
knowing there's some kid
with a gun

29:27.928 --> 29:29.829
stuffed in his backpack
walking around these halls.

29:29.863 --> 29:31.730
No. Either the kid
took the gun home,

29:31.765 --> 29:33.333
in which case, they won't
be able to bring it back

29:33.367 --> 29:35.801
because of the new
metal detectors.

29:35.836 --> 29:36.236
Or the kid stashed it somewhere

29:36.270 --> 29:38.504
here at school.
Yeah.

29:38.538 --> 29:40.073
In which case, the police
are going to find it.

29:40.107 --> 29:42.942
I mean, they are
searching every locker,

29:42.976 --> 29:44.677
and interviewing
every single student.

29:44.711 --> 29:46.512
Every single student?

29:46.546 --> 29:49.015
Yeah. Then when they find
who did it, the kid's

29:49.050 --> 29:51.051
going to be expelled.

29:53.287 --> 29:56.189
Well, no student's
going to get expelled.

29:56.224 --> 29:58.191
Why not?

29:58.226 --> 30:00.227
'Cause it was my gun.

30:10.471 --> 30:12.005
It's registered.

30:12.039 --> 30:14.540
I have a license for it.

30:14.574 --> 30:16.508
I'm sorry,
but in light of recent events,

30:16.543 --> 30:18.677
I feel more safe
with it in my office.

30:18.712 --> 30:20.946
Look, Sue, I'm not going
to argue the merits

30:20.981 --> 30:22.781
of armed teachers right now.

30:22.816 --> 30:24.217
It's a different world from
when you and I started teaching.

30:24.252 --> 30:26.552
Or rather,
when I started teaching,

30:26.586 --> 30:28.587
and you started doing
whatever it is that you do.

30:28.622 --> 30:29.755
The safety net

30:29.789 --> 30:32.259
of the public
mental health system is gone.

30:32.293 --> 30:35.095
Parents with troubled kids
are too busy working three jobs

30:35.129 --> 30:37.763
to look after them,

30:37.797 --> 30:40.900
and the gun yahoos
have everyone so worked up

30:40.934 --> 30:42.835
about Obama
taking away their guns

30:42.869 --> 30:45.905
that every house has
a readily-available arsenal.

30:45.939 --> 30:47.440
But having a gun
to make you feel safe,

30:47.475 --> 30:51.444
and shooting it in school
are two different things.

30:51.479 --> 30:53.246
I was just doing my daily

30:53.281 --> 30:56.615
<i>safety check,</i>
<i>making sure Uma Thurman...</i>

30:56.650 --> 30:58.517
<i>that's what I call her...</i>

30:58.551 --> 31:01.754
<i>was locked up tight, and</i>
<i>she accidentally went off.</i>

31:01.788 --> 31:04.124
When she fired, I dropped her,

31:04.158 --> 31:07.260
and the second shot came
when the gun hit the floor.

31:07.295 --> 31:09.862
This doesn't make
any sense, Sue.

31:09.896 --> 31:12.798
Bullets leave bullet marks,
shell casings.

31:12.832 --> 31:14.934
The casings are at
the bottom of a lake.

31:14.968 --> 31:17.937
And I moved some posters
and a tub of protein powder

31:17.971 --> 31:19.571
to cover up the holes.

31:19.606 --> 31:21.640
"Cover-up" is
the optimal phrase.

31:21.675 --> 31:23.709
I panicked.

31:23.743 --> 31:25.111
Okay? I'm...

31:25.146 --> 31:27.113
I'm sorry.

31:27.148 --> 31:28.448
It took a couple

31:28.482 --> 31:31.084
of days for me
to come to my senses,

31:31.118 --> 31:35.355
but I'm here now,
ready to take my punishment.

31:39.859 --> 31:42.795
You do realize
my hands are tied, don't you?

31:42.829 --> 31:45.798
I have to report to the police
and the school board.

31:45.832 --> 31:48.801
There are policies
in place, Sue.

31:48.835 --> 31:50.903
Zero tolerance policies.

31:50.937 --> 31:52.372
Yeah, I'm aware of them.

31:54.342 --> 31:57.143
You know, it's funny
how this stuff works out.

31:57.178 --> 32:01.513
An entire career doing
the right thing, winning.

32:03.850 --> 32:06.618
I sent Cheerios off
to the Ivy Leagues.

32:06.653 --> 32:08.088
I educated girls who are CEOs

32:08.122 --> 32:10.390
of Fortune 500 companies.

32:10.424 --> 32:13.093
They're mothers,
gold medalists.

32:13.127 --> 32:15.095
I've coached two Grammy winners,

32:15.129 --> 32:17.097
an Internet billionaire

32:17.131 --> 32:20.133
and a lesbian
secretary of state.

32:24.604 --> 32:27.307
But all I'll be remembered for

32:27.341 --> 32:29.442
is this one thing.

32:34.547 --> 32:36.782
It'll be the first line
of my obituary.

32:37.851 --> 32:40.786
I'm sorry, Sue.

32:40.820 --> 32:42.188
I have no choice.

32:55.489 --> 32:59.422
I couldn't sleep,
neither could my mom and dad,

32:59.456 --> 33:02.492
so we just stayed up
all night, talking

33:03.526 --> 33:04.460
and crying
and hugging each other.

33:04.495 --> 33:06.928
I know.

33:06.963 --> 33:08.131
My parents wanted me
to stay home this week,

33:08.165 --> 33:10.333
but I told them, no way.

33:14.570 --> 33:15.104
It sounds crazy,
Blaine, but I...

33:15.139 --> 33:18.007
I wanted to be in that
choir room with you guys.

33:18.042 --> 33:19.342
Believe me, you didn't.

33:19.376 --> 33:21.826
It was the most scared I think
I've ever been in my life.

33:21.843 --> 33:23.144
Me, too, but not because
of what was happening,

33:23.178 --> 33:25.912
but because I
couldn't get to you,

33:25.947 --> 33:27.115
or do anything
to help you, or...

33:30.018 --> 33:32.053
Or even say good-bye.

33:32.087 --> 33:36.823
I-I think the important thing is
that no one got hurt.

33:36.858 --> 33:38.925
Yeah.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.328
And that you know
that you're my family.

33:42.697 --> 33:44.965
Everybody in that room
is my family.

33:44.999 --> 33:47.968
And I didn't want the
last thing you guys heard

33:47.002 --> 33:50.837
from me is some snarky comment
about how I never get solos.

34:03.337 --> 34:05.904
Oh, I love you, Tina.

34:07.540 --> 34:08.774
Oh.

34:10.543 --> 34:12.043
Now you listen to me.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.248
You were there
in the choir room with us.

34:15.282 --> 34:17.815
Mm-hmm.
Okay?

34:17.850 --> 34:19.818
You were there.

34:19.851 --> 34:20.219
Come on.

34:28.694 --> 34:30.496
Read my lips
because we know you can't read words.

34:31.531 --> 34:32.664
I didn't catfish you.

34:32.697 --> 34:33.831
I'm not into guys

34:33.866 --> 34:35.801
who look like life-sized
cartoon wieners.

34:35.835 --> 34:36.235
Now excuse me,
because just thinking

34:36.270 --> 34:38.137
about me and you dating
makes me drier

34:38.172 --> 34:40.806
than the cast
of <i>Hot in Cleveland.</i>

34:40.840 --> 34:42.308
It's totally her.
Think of it.

34:42.342 --> 34:45.077
Kitty and Katie are
practically the same name.

34:45.112 --> 34:47.179
That's genius,
because it's so obvious.

34:47.214 --> 34:50.849
Brittany's dating Sam,
Unique's ringtone is.

34:50.882 --> 34:52.818
"Bootylicious," and Sugar
and Tina weren't even there.

34:52.851 --> 34:54.518
Okay, so what if it is Kitty?

34:54.554 --> 34:55.021
Would it really be that bad?

34:55.054 --> 34:57.456
You have to admit,
she has been much cooler lately,

34:57.491 --> 35:00.092
and maybe the only way
she can be completely honest is

35:00.127 --> 35:01.360
by being anonymous.

35:01.395 --> 35:03.962
What if it's that bass player

35:03.996 --> 35:05.530
with the bowl cut, or

35:05.565 --> 35:06.698
Brad, the piano player?

35:06.732 --> 35:08.533
W-Whoever it is,
I'll find out at 3:30.

35:08.568 --> 35:09.868
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

35:12.538 --> 35:13.905
Okay.

35:14.974 --> 35:15.174
The first word I'd use

35:15.209 --> 35:17.843
to describe you would be brave.

35:17.877 --> 35:18.377
Hmm.

35:18.412 --> 35:21.880
Then, funny,
strong inside and out,

35:21.914 --> 35:24.217
great hugger,
and wears kick-ass red lipstick.

35:24.251 --> 35:28.454
In fact, that's what I used
to describe you in this.

35:30.590 --> 35:32.291
Online dating?

35:32.326 --> 35:35.961
Nobody ever meets anyone
on this.

35:35.995 --> 35:36.162
Of course they do.

35:36.196 --> 35:38.897
How do you think
everyone's meeting up nowadays?

35:38.931 --> 35:41.800
How did you know
my favorite Beatle was George?

35:41.834 --> 35:43.236
And my favorite food was everything?

35:43.270 --> 35:46.472
You know, I-I...
I could not have gone

35:47.506 --> 35:50.042
through that horror
the other day without you.

35:50.077 --> 35:53.112
I know this seems scary, but...

35:53.146 --> 35:55.014
the time for you
to get out there is now.

35:55.048 --> 35:57.450
Thank you, Will,
for doing this for me.

35:57.484 --> 35:59.085
I love you.

35:59.119 --> 36:01.620
I love you, too.

36:02.456 --> 36:05.358
So, you think anyone's going
to respond to this? Jackpot.

36:05.392 --> 36:07.759
You got one already. Hmm.

36:07.793 --> 36:08.294
He's in Oregon,

36:08.328 --> 36:10.296
he's a former
football coach, too.

36:10.330 --> 36:13.798
Ken Tanaka.

36:18.238 --> 36:20.273
Hi, baby.

36:20.307 --> 36:22.208
Are you feeling
any more normal?

36:22.242 --> 36:24.310
Not really.

36:24.344 --> 36:28.914
I mean, I was genuinely scared
when I was in the choir room,

36:28.948 --> 36:31.783
and you were out here all alone.

36:31.817 --> 36:32.051
Couldn't stop thinking
about you.

36:32.085 --> 36:34.819
You were all
I thought about, too.

36:34.854 --> 36:36.621
Not Lord Tubbington?

36:36.656 --> 36:38.224
No. At first, I thought he might
be the one doing the shooting.

36:38.258 --> 36:40.126
I've kind of been a jerk
about him lately.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.395
I mean, it's not like
he's that nice to me.

36:42.429 --> 36:44.397
I shut down his
e-mail account

36:44.431 --> 36:47.565
so he wouldn't send you
any more harassing messages.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.568
Look, he's your cat,
and if he's important to you,

36:50.603 --> 36:51.070
he's important to me, too.

36:51.104 --> 36:53.738
That said...
Mm.

36:53.773 --> 36:54.106
I've been thinking

36:54.141 --> 36:56.975
that we needed something
that's really ours.

36:56.009 --> 36:58.743
We had a fake wedding,

36:58.778 --> 37:00.179
and I think we should
also start a fake family.

37:00.213 --> 37:03.182
Did you get me a fake baby?
Better.

37:07.454 --> 37:09.288
Her name is Lady Tubbington.

37:09.323 --> 37:12.158
I made sure to get a fat one
at the shelter

37:12.192 --> 37:14.693
so Lord Tubbington
doesn't feel self-conscious.

37:14.727 --> 37:15.927
Oh.

37:15.962 --> 37:18.530
How long was she in there for?

37:18.564 --> 37:19.531
A while.

37:19.565 --> 37:21.599
Oh.

37:21.634 --> 37:22.168
She's amazing.

37:22.202 --> 37:24.569
Mm.

37:24.603 --> 37:25.004
I love you.
I love you.

37:36.615 --> 37:38.083
Why, Sue?
Why did you do it?

37:38.117 --> 37:41.585
Well, I had my reasons.

37:41.620 --> 37:43.255
I explained them to
Principal Figgins.

37:43.289 --> 37:46.057
I heard... but I don't
accept that.

37:47.460 --> 37:50.395
Bringing a gun to school?
That's not you.

37:50.430 --> 37:52.063
<i>I was scared, Coach.</i>

37:52.098 --> 37:54.433
About graduating,
being out in the world

37:54.467 --> 37:56.934
with no one to protect me.

37:56.968 --> 37:59.503
Honey, told you. You will always
have a place here.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.839
No. I wanted to be prepared

38:01.873 --> 38:02.274
and protect myself!

38:02.308 --> 38:06.911
I need help.

38:06.945 --> 38:08.846
I don't know what
to tell you, Will.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.648
I stand by my actions.

38:11.817 --> 38:13.084
Becky... give me the gun.

38:13.119 --> 38:15.086
Where did you get that?

38:15.121 --> 38:17.922
It's my dad's.
I wanted to be ready.

38:17.956 --> 38:19.424
Oh, I know sweetheart.
Don't worry about it.

38:19.459 --> 38:21.293
I completely understand.
Just-just give me the gun.

38:22.128 --> 38:23.395
So, that's it?

38:23.429 --> 38:25.896
This is how it ends?

38:25.931 --> 38:27.332
Give me something
so I can talk to Figgins.

38:27.366 --> 38:30.601
Let me help you.

38:38.877 --> 38:40.544
I'm sorry, Coach.

38:40.579 --> 38:42.546
I'm sorry.

38:42.581 --> 38:43.781
Shh.

38:43.815 --> 38:44.049
Shh. It's okay.

38:44.083 --> 38:46.184
Come on! Oh! It's okay.

38:46.219 --> 38:48.853
I'll take care of it.

38:48.887 --> 38:50.288
Keep an eye on Becky, will you?

38:50.323 --> 38:52.923
She's tough,

38:52.958 --> 38:54.925
but like all the kids,

38:54.960 --> 38:56.961
she gets scared sometimes.

39:05.338 --> 39:07.339
Thanks, buddy.

39:33.865 --> 39:35.966
Shouldn't you be at
the mandatory school assembly?

39:35.001 --> 39:37.601
We're having a secret
Glee Club meeting instead,

39:37.636 --> 39:38.869
but I was waiting for someone.

39:39.438 --> 39:41.006
She was supposed
to meet me here at 3:30.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.208
Well, good luck with that.

39:43.242 --> 39:45.709
What?

39:45.744 --> 39:48.512
Aren't you gonna write me up
for not being at the assembly?

39:48.547 --> 39:50.548
I would, but I don't
work here anymore.

Mom, Dad, I love you guys,

42:25.337 --> 42:30.841
and there is a cat
in my backpack in my locker.

42:30.875 --> 42:32.010
Please feed her for me.

42:32.044 --> 42:34.012
Anyone that ever watches this,

42:34.046 --> 42:37.681
never stop believing
in yourself.

42:37.716 --> 42:39.150
Hi, Mom and Dad.
I just wanted you to know...

42:39.185 --> 42:41.352
...that I love you.

42:41.387 --> 42:44.955
And this has been
the best year of my life.

42:44.989 --> 42:48.992
Even though...
maybe it didn't seem like it.

42:48.027 --> 42:50.728
I just want to say

42:50.762 --> 42:54.562
that I've had the best
experience of my entire life

42:54.580 --> 42:56.001
in this room, and that I love
these people more than anything.
