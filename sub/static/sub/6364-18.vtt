00:02.203 --> 00:03.035
.

00:03.036 --> 00:03.868
Lindsay, this is
my brother will.

00:03.869 --> 00:04.701
- The surgeon.
- Most days, yeah.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.005
How long you in town for?

00:06.007 --> 00:07.039
I haven't decided yet.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.307
Don't you have
a medical practice?

00:08.309 --> 00:09.341
I took a break.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.809
- Hey, sergeant?
- Yeah.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.276
I just want to thank you
for this opportunity.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.712
- I'm gonna do a great job.
- Fine.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.147
What are you doing here,
nadia?

00:15.149 --> 00:17.316
I'm gonna be a cop one day,
and a damn good one.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.451
What happened?

00:19.453 --> 00:23.422
I might not have told you
everything about why i left.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.527
[police radio chatter]

00:31.732 --> 00:36.502
Watch your step, they're
still flagging brain matter.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.803
Truck driver?

00:37.805 --> 00:39.805
Name's aaron mcintire.
He's in the wind.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.707
No eyewitnesses.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.642
Don't count on anyone coming
outta the woodwork down here.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.077
The sedan
came back stolen.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.513
What, you done this
before?

00:47.515 --> 00:49.815
Detective? Found these
in the cab of the truck.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.750
Crystal meth, looks like.

00:51.752 --> 00:55.154
No. These are
jesus malverde crystals.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.822
Patron saint of
mexican drug dealers.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.791
They carry 'em
to ward off evil.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.592
Could have fallen
out of someone's pocket.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.362
All right, so it's
a truck-jacking gone bad.

01:04.799 --> 01:06.432
You check the container?

01:06.434 --> 01:07.699
We were waiting on
you guys.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.401
There's a smuggler's lock
on the door.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.703
This kid's
in the gang database.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.105
Darius gifford.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.573
He's with the
gangster disciples.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.442
I'm guessing his buddy's
in it, too.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.744
It's a long way from home.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.813
I mean, this is vice lord
territory. You got an lka?

01:20.815 --> 01:22.815
Yeah. Public housing
in the deuce.

01:22.817 --> 01:24.616
(halstead)
all right, i'll roll there.
I'll notify the family.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.351
Maybe not alone.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.287
Hey, done this before.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.764
Seek.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.299
Come on, seek.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.403
[whimpers]

01:44.405 --> 01:45.838
There it is.

interstate traffickers,

01:58.352 --> 02:00.219
They hide drugs inside
frozen strawberries.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.720
Never seen 'em use sauce
before.

02:01.722 --> 02:05.257
Yeah, someone's gonna be
looking for that.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.566
(kid)
who's there?

02:14.568 --> 02:17.703
Police.
Can you open up?

02:19.740 --> 02:21.740
Can i see your badge, please?

02:21.742 --> 02:23.408
Yeah.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.644
It's the real deal
right there.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.613
I'm jay. This is erin.
What's your name?

02:27.615 --> 02:29.231
I'm denise.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.848
(lindsay)
denise, is anybody home
with you right now?

02:30.851 --> 02:32.184
Mm-mm

02:32.186 --> 02:33.785
Does darius gifford
live here?

02:33.787 --> 02:36.221
Mm-hmm, he's my brother.

02:36.223 --> 02:37.789
Can we look inside
his room?

02:37.791 --> 02:40.225
No, 'cause he said
nobody's allowed in his room.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.761
We're allowed.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.376
Looks like our doa came here

02:57.378 --> 02:58.810
To change out of anything
identifiable.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.446
[sighs]

03:01.448 --> 03:04.249
Denise, was your brother here
with a friend?

03:04.251 --> 03:08.620
Yeah, with andre
and another boy i didn't know.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.622
They were yelling at him
a lot,

03:10.624 --> 03:12.658
And andre had a gun.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.827
Did your brother
have a gun, too?

03:15.829 --> 03:17.462
Who else lives here
with you?

03:17.464 --> 03:19.948
Just me and darius.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.433
My mom is dead, and my dad
had to go to jail.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.470
All right.

03:25.472 --> 03:28.507
We're gonna
take a ride then, okay?

03:28.509 --> 03:30.309
Hey, we got a problem.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.361
Our two doas from the truck.
Darius gifford, andre davis.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.663
Both up-and-comers
with the gangster disciples.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.898
They changed out
at darius's apartment.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.766
Them and a third guy
who was kind enough

03:54.768 --> 03:56.435
- To leave behind his wallet.
- Mm.

03:56.437 --> 04:00.973
That came out of the wallet
belonging to a charles gray.

04:00.975 --> 04:03.575
We think that he was
the third occupant

04:03.577 --> 04:04.910
Of the car at the scene.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.778
(olinsky)
except charles has no record.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.480
He's not in the gang database.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.382
Unlike our
victims/possible offenders.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.418
(lindsay) little girl says
they had a gun to him.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.688
So sounds like
he was coerced.

04:16.690 --> 04:20.259
Well, let's--let's find him
and ask how this wound up there.

04:20.261 --> 04:23.795
Yeah, you got any ideas?

04:23.797 --> 04:26.398
If i did,
i would've shared 'em.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.400
(olinsky)
charles has an unknown father.

04:28.402 --> 04:32.037
His mother is michelle post,
lives nearby.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.739
Hmm.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.911
All right, well, somebody knew
something about this truck.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.648
Ask narcotics if
they had any chatter

04:42.650 --> 04:45.350
About a $2 million shipment
coming.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.652
And i wanna know everything
there is to know

04:46.654 --> 04:47.653
About this driver.

04:47.655 --> 04:51.456
Did he run
or was he snatched?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.525
I'll talk to
michelle post.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.629
Hey,

04:57.631 --> 05:00.432
Who's michelle post?

05:00.434 --> 05:04.002
Well, that's the lady that
voight's going to talk to.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.440
Mm.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.677
So you like 'em
with everything?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.445
I've never had one.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.080
You've never had
a belgian waffle?

05:15.082 --> 05:16.648
[laughs]
nope.

05:16.650 --> 05:20.052
Well, what do you think
now that you've had one?

05:20.054 --> 05:22.387
It's okay.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.655
Okay.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.461
My aunt is always late,

05:29.463 --> 05:31.897
'cause...

05:31.899 --> 05:33.732
She's on drugs.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.735
Okay.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.771
Well, i'm gonna be
right back, okay?

05:39.773 --> 05:42.507
Okay.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.876
Let's have it.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.449
I pulled strings
for this.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.951
Do our public institutions
no longer teach penmanship?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.553
Well, everything's digital.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.887
And i really appreciate this,
sarge.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.023
You're gonna be the coolest kid
in criminology class.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.742
Is this
your first ride-along?

05:59.743 --> 06:01.460
Yeah. 'cept the last time
i was in cuffs.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.563
Was that a joke, civilian?
This is not a joke.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.698
Burgess and roman agreed
to do this for you.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.934
Their necks
are on the line.

06:08.936 --> 06:12.070
This is a bulletproof vest.
Wear it.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.006
This is
a smith & wesson 38 special.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.845
Okay, that was a joke.
And a test.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.581
You failed both.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.517
Outside that door you represent
the 21st district,

06:25.519 --> 06:29.654
You represent me and voight
and every cpd officer.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.957
So pay attention
and do as you're told,

06:31.959 --> 06:34.626
Which is to do
exactly nothing.

06:37.831 --> 06:41.400
But do it well.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.667
She's all yours.

06:42.669 --> 06:47.406
Hey, are you ready for your
first day, officer decotis?

06:47.408 --> 06:48.840
Ay-yi-yi.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.042
(michelle)
sorry, i'm late for work.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.677
I only got a minute.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.413
Hey, how is work?

06:54.415 --> 06:57.015
It's work. Either i'm
the best paralegal ever,

06:57.017 --> 07:00.786
Or lawyers aren't smart in
real life like they are on tv.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.053
Well, that could be.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.189
Look, i know
why you're here.

07:04.191 --> 07:07.426
Is charles in
some kind of trouble?

07:07.428 --> 07:10.862
We don't know yet.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.531
He didn't call you?

07:12.533 --> 07:16.535
I gave him your card.
That's why you're here.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.769
Have a seat.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.507
We found his wallet
at the apartment of a kid

07:22.509 --> 07:24.109
Who was shot dead
outside a truck

07:24.111 --> 07:25.811
Carrying $2 million
in heroin.

07:25.813 --> 07:29.147
No, no, no, no.
See, charles is doing good.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.016
He just got his
commercial driver's license.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.819
He has an interview
at the parks department.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.455
And you gave him
my card why?

07:36.457 --> 07:39.591
Just in case
he got in a bind.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.960
But he turned a corner.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.764
I told him how you
helped me out back then.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.837
Let me ask you something.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.772
You ever seen these boys?

07:53.774 --> 07:57.209
Darius gifford,
andre davis.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.980
Never seen them before
in my life.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.087
I know that look.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.023
I know what
you're thinking.

08:12.025 --> 08:15.160
I'm telling the truth.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.699
(tech)
found this gps device

08:20.701 --> 08:22.100
Tucked up under the rear axle
of the trailer.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.802
Thought you might want
to take a look.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.071
Yeah, that's weird--shipping
company uses dashboard gps.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.939
No, dummy, that gps
actually belongs to

08:27.941 --> 08:29.608
Whoever was shipping
the heroin.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.878
You would probably wanna track
$2 million of product, too.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.979
Mouse, can you
reverse the signal,

08:33.981 --> 08:35.246
Figure out where
it's being tracked from?

08:35.249 --> 08:37.249
Yeah, it's easy peasy.
You call me dummy?

08:37.251 --> 08:40.519
Yeah, so reverse the--
the dumb stuff.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.224
Hey, you get anything
from the mom?

08:46.226 --> 08:48.727
Not really.
Where are you?

08:48.729 --> 08:50.629
Well, the truck
was never opened.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.898
It's a botched robbery.
How does that happen?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.699
I think charles
and his friends

08:54.701 --> 08:56.601
Were riding behind the truck
as security.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.303
They got hit
by mexican gangbangers--

08:58.305 --> 09:00.205
Which explains the malverde
crystals at the scene.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.707
Uh-huh. Kids go down
defending their product.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.643
Charles knows the cops
are coming, so he runs.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.144
He's either dead,
or he's hiding.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.846
No, charles
ain't caught up.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.214
How do we know that?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.650
Well, his friends are
gangbangers, he isn't.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.585
We can't even place him
at the scene.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.720
I want to know where
that truck was headed

09:15.722 --> 09:16.721
And whose drugs they were.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.223
(halstead)
that's cool, but...

09:18.225 --> 09:21.893
What i asked was, how do we know
charles isn't caught up?

09:24.331 --> 09:27.098
Because i just said so.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.936
Ruzek's trying to figure out
where the drugs were headed.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.238
All right,
where's the driver?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.974
We've got an alert out on him,
nothing from state troopers yet.

09:35.976 --> 09:40.645
Olinsky's headed to
his apartment to check it out.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.747
Move faster.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.720
(mouse)
so the gps uses
a cellular connection

09:48.722 --> 09:50.188
To check in with
a central data server.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.357
That server holds
the account info, see?

09:52.359 --> 09:54.125
All right, great,
i'll get a warrant,

09:54.127 --> 09:55.827
Get the gps company
to hand it over.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.996
Well, i already accessed
their server.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.164
What? What?

09:59.166 --> 10:01.833
Yeah, it was faster.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.969
All right, so the ip address
used to check in

10:03.971 --> 10:06.004
Is located at 2200 wabash.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.772
See, the truck hits that
location once a month

10:07.774 --> 10:09.224
And stays at that location

10:09.225 --> 10:10.675
No longer than 30 minutes
every time.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.043
All right, here, my turn.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.945
Okay.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.680
It's a gangster disciples
location.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.082
There was an arrest there
five years ago.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.817
Gangster disciples.
How does that help us?

10:18.819 --> 10:21.386
Two victims, charles gray's
friends, were g-ds.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.088
The heroin was headed
to a g-d location.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.889
I'll bet they know where
charles is at. Let's go.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.091
- All right.
- Let's go.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.059
We should tell voight
we're rolling out.

10:28.061 --> 10:31.730
Yeah, it seems like he's got
a lot on his plate.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.799
You don't have to come.
Mouse, just text me the address.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.972
We can't just move
on the warehouse.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.008
There could be
20 guys in there.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.876
Could be hiding charles
in there.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.412
Why do you want to
find this kid?

10:47.414 --> 10:49.247
You trying to
make a point to voight?

10:49.249 --> 10:52.217
He wants us
to take the lead.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.323
[sighs]

10:58.325 --> 11:02.661
We're made. The whole block's
on countersurveillance.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.963
(atwater)
all right, we're gonna try
something different.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.438
We need more brothers
on this unit, man.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.974
I'm your brother,
kev.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.143
Yeah, you are.
Don't tell halstead, though.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.311
He gets jealous
about stuff like that.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.413
[chuckles]

11:21.415 --> 11:24.883
Hey, what's up?
How y'all doing?

11:24.885 --> 11:26.151
I know you?

11:26.153 --> 11:27.752
I don't know.
You know a lot of cops?

11:27.754 --> 11:30.021
Hey, don't worry about it.
Got people everywhere.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.156
Let's go back inside
just for a hot minute.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.190
I don't think
you wanna do that.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.391
I don't think you wanna
do that.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.893
I think we might
want to, bro.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.828
I'm telling you, man,
it's not a good idea.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.832
No, no, please--

11:40.834 --> 11:42.801
Wait, wait, wait.
Listen, listen!

11:42.803 --> 11:44.202
I'm telling you,
we gotta get outta here!

11:44.204 --> 11:46.404
- I'm telling you we gotta...
- I said on the wall!

11:46.406 --> 11:48.406
Wait! No!
Don't let the door close!

11:48.408 --> 11:50.008
(ruzek)
get up against the wall!
Stay there!

11:50.010 --> 11:52.343
(atwater)
both of you face
the wall!

11:52.345 --> 11:54.412
Stay there.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.181
Get his phone.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.851
Guys.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.152
Whoa!

12:01.154 --> 12:03.021
- They're burning it down!
- Oh, damn!

12:03.023 --> 12:04.923
(marcus)
i told you,
we gotta get outta here!

12:04.925 --> 12:06.291
Everybody out!
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.959
Damn!

12:08.929 --> 12:10.261
What's wrong
with the door?!

12:10.263 --> 12:11.763
It's locked
from the outside.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.165
There's no other door!

12:14.167 --> 12:16.735
This is 5021-ida.
Emergency. Emergency.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.738
10-1, we are locked down
at 2200 wabash.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.406
Roll fire.
I repeat, roll fire.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.274
We are surrounded by flames,
holding two offenders.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.476
(dispatch)
on our way.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.781
The two of you
get as low as you can.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.482
Get down, all right?
Keep your mouths covered.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.818
[coughs]

12:39.259 --> 12:40.258
Jay!

12:40.260 --> 12:42.160
Over here!

12:45.532 --> 12:47.966
Can you get up here?

12:47.968 --> 12:50.001
[coughs]

12:50.003 --> 12:51.770
Kev! Kevin!

12:51.772 --> 12:53.104
Over here!

12:56.109 --> 12:57.842
I got you.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.121
(atwater)
there you go, jay.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.156
- Get the door!
- Go!

13:11.158 --> 13:12.423
Get the door!

13:12.425 --> 13:14.893
He's out the window!
He's out the window!

13:14.895 --> 13:17.328
- Come on! Come here.
- Come on. Come on.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.396
Jay!

13:25.205 --> 13:26.304
Let's go!

13:26.306 --> 13:29.374
[coughing]

13:33.513 --> 13:35.046
(lindsay)
hey! Hey!

13:35.048 --> 13:37.148
Wait! Wait, what are y'all
doing? We helped y'all!

13:37.150 --> 13:39.017
We told y'all what was going on.
You can't arrest us.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.119
Did i say you were
under arrest?

13:41.121 --> 13:45.023
I don't think so. Come on.
You all are coming with us.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.024
Have a little talk.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.927
[distant laughter, chatter]

13:51.264 --> 13:56.301
Sherri, this is sergeant platt
again at the 21st district.

13:56.303 --> 13:59.571
You are now four hours late
from our agreed-upon time

13:59.573 --> 14:00.972
To pick up your niece.

14:00.974 --> 14:05.210
When my shift ends
if you are not here,

14:05.212 --> 14:08.313
I will place her with
child and family services

14:08.315 --> 14:12.517
Which i do not want to do,
but will if i have to.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.201
I made a call. It was stupid,
and it was dangerous.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.039
I don't know who charles gray
is to you,

14:35.041 --> 14:37.909
But i was just
following a lead.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.379
Charles...

14:43.884 --> 14:47.118
His mother was intimate with
an informant i was working.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.054
It was 20 years ago,
gang unit.

14:50.056 --> 14:55.193
One day she calls me,
says the guy's cracked up.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.198
I arrive, he's got
a knife to her throat.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.203
I shot my own c.I.
To save her.

15:07.274 --> 15:11.109
She knew more
than my informant.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.610
But she didn't want
city money.

15:12.612 --> 15:17.248
She just...Wanted out
completely.

15:17.250 --> 15:21.052
So because you're close
with the mom,

15:21.054 --> 15:23.488
You're sure
the son is clean.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.326
The only thing
i'm sure of, jay,

15:28.328 --> 15:31.930
Is the sun will
come out tomorrow.

15:31.932 --> 15:36.534
I'm just letting you know
i trust this woman.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.971
She's only done good
by me.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.147
So y'all don't know nothing
about a g-d shipment last night?

15:49.149 --> 15:51.182
That's $2 million worth
of white,

15:51.184 --> 15:52.417
And you don't know
nothing about it?

15:52.419 --> 15:53.651
I know about a promise
you made.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.186
You said we wasn't
gonna get arrested.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.256
The promise is still good.
Do you have cuffs on?

15:59.693 --> 16:02.660
(ruzek)
all right, do you recognize
these two?

16:05.665 --> 16:08.166
Great! So you know them.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.735
Look, no one outside of this
room is gonna know what you say.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.704
Who tried to rob the truck?

16:16.276 --> 16:17.675
They did.

16:17.677 --> 16:21.045
They did?

16:21.047 --> 16:23.448
They weren't trailing the truck?
They weren't security?

16:23.450 --> 16:26.451
No, they wasn't even
supposed to be there.

16:26.453 --> 16:29.187
They were supposed to be at
the spot to unload the truck.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.055
They robbed
their own clique.

16:31.057 --> 16:34.158
Them and some other dude.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.729
(atwater)
this dude?

16:37.731 --> 16:39.664
I don't know.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.598
But tell you what, chief is
looking for whoever did it,

16:41.601 --> 16:45.036
And he out 2 mil,
so somebody gonna pay.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.443
G-d's put 10 grand on the street

16:52.445 --> 16:54.345
For any information
that ids charles.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.214
(mouse)
i looked into
his social media, his facebook.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.349
There's no overlap with
the victims from the robbery.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.251
He must know them from the bad
old days.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.552
So maybe he's safe?

17:01.554 --> 17:03.554
(halstead)
none of us caught it--

17:03.556 --> 17:06.758
Charles has a class a license.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.395
He knew how to drive
the tractor trailer.

17:10.396 --> 17:13.097
All right, so he's a good kid
with bad friends.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.565
He gets pulled into
their robbery crew

17:14.567 --> 17:16.067
To be a getaway driver.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.801
They were gonna hijack
their own truck.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.637
The mexican angle--
what are we missing?

17:19.638 --> 17:21.239
(halstead)
plenty.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.141
Without charles,
we don't have a witness.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.609
So missing truck driver's
our most likely murder suspect.

17:25.612 --> 17:29.213
Charles and his buddies roll up,
driver starts blasting.

17:29.215 --> 17:33.251
Aaron mcintire--47 years old

17:33.253 --> 17:35.486
And, according to his trucking
company, a model employee.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.289
A model employee registered
with a .40-caliber handgun.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.558
Same caliber as the victims
at the scene.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.427
(olinsky)
we checked his apartment.
His car was still in the lot.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.363
We alerted drug interdiction
agencies along the highway.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.815
Nothing.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.266
I should be sitting across
from this guy right now.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.634
Guy's hauling drugs,

17:49.636 --> 17:51.536
Might've killed two kids
a mile from here.

17:51.538 --> 17:55.206
He has two stepsons from an
ex-wife. His son keith is local.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.276
Hit it. You and al.

18:03.349 --> 18:06.417
What'd voight say?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.821
He told me a story.

18:09.823 --> 18:11.823
About how he gave
the mom a card.

18:11.825 --> 18:14.459
And because of that,
we operate in the dark.

18:14.461 --> 18:18.229
If he told you
what he did for me,

18:18.231 --> 18:19.831
You wouldn't like it.

18:19.833 --> 18:23.734
But the only way i'm here having
this conversation with you

18:23.736 --> 18:27.271
Is because of what he did.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.776
Maybe.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.378
I'd like to think
i could handle it.

18:34.380 --> 18:37.448
I hear you.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.752
The kid matters to voight.
So he matters to me.

18:41.754 --> 18:45.790
That's the gig.
It's simple.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.502
A barking dog.
That's why we're here?

18:57.504 --> 18:59.170
Yeah, it's a quality
of life violation.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.272
Can i ask something?

19:01.274 --> 19:02.907
You two were told to only take
b.S. Calls

19:02.909 --> 19:04.342
Because i'm back here today.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.743
That didn't sound
like a question.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.179
Platt really did pull strings
to get you in our car.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.347
The city's careful now.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.815
Something happens,
and you sue us...

19:10.817 --> 19:12.316
I'm not gonna sue,
because nothing's gonna happen.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.485
That's kinda the point.
Just stay in the car.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.420
We'll check on fido,
and then drive through

19:16.422 --> 19:18.890
The worst neighborhood
in the district, i promise.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.491
You warm enough
back there?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.693
- I don't even hear a dog.
- All right, just sit tight.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.935
[radio chatter]

19:34.541 --> 19:37.608
Chicago police!
Anyone home?

19:41.214 --> 19:42.380
[doorknob jingling]

19:43.449 --> 19:44.749
Yeah.

19:46.953 --> 19:51.455
[radio chatter]

20:00.466 --> 20:02.333
Hello?

20:02.335 --> 20:03.801
Chicago police!
Anyone home?!

20:03.803 --> 20:05.670
[muffled yelling]

20:05.672 --> 20:07.305
- Burgess.
- Oh, my god.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.752
[cell phone beeps]

20:49.015 --> 20:52.016
I'm a police officer.
You need to turn the car off

20:52.018 --> 20:54.919
And remain inside with your
hands where i can see them.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.966
[gunshots]

21:08.968 --> 21:10.801
2113 emergency.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.938
Shots fired at the police
at the 1900 block of west ohio.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.273
(dispatcher)
copy that, 2113...

21:15.275 --> 21:16.841
[gunfire continues]

21:17.844 --> 21:19.510
[crash]

21:19.512 --> 21:22.713
[wheels spinning]

21:22.715 --> 21:23.781
[crash]

21:26.352 --> 21:27.551
Requesting
immediate backup!

21:27.553 --> 21:28.719
Use extreme caution.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.554
Offenders may be
holding a citizen.

21:30.556 --> 21:32.690
- Roman, go!
- Get out of the car!

21:32.692 --> 21:33.858
Get out of the car!

21:33.860 --> 21:34.925
Get your hands
out of the car!

21:34.927 --> 21:37.528
Outta the car!
Get out of the car!

21:37.530 --> 21:39.063
- Rogers, you got him?
- Yeah.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.565
Here's the truck.
Come on, let's go.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.934
Nadia! Nadia! Nadia!

21:43.936 --> 21:46.604
- Are you--are you hurt?
- No, i--

21:46.606 --> 21:48.039
- Are you hit?
- No, i think i'm good.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.740
Let me check.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.409
Roman left the keys.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.016
Squad, disregard
the missing citizen.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.584
(dispatch)
copy that, 2113.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.420
We got 'em.

22:02.422 --> 22:05.489
Yeah, we got 'em.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.060
(keith)
yes, aaron mcintire's
my stepdad.

22:09.062 --> 22:10.928
He called yesterday
from the road.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.563
He seemed shaken up.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.698
What'd he say?

22:13.700 --> 22:15.966
Somebody was after him.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.502
Said he messed up,
but wouldn't say how.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.072
He called from
a wisconsin number.

22:21.074 --> 22:23.974
I know the area code 'cause we
have a hunting cabin up there.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.509
I told him to call
the cops,

22:25.511 --> 22:27.812
But he said they'd
never believe his story.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.880
He'd be surprised.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.717
We hear all kinds of stuff.

22:32.719 --> 22:35.119
We're gonna need the address
to the cabin.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.687
Anyone else up there
who knows him,

22:36.689 --> 22:38.656
We need their info, too.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.658
Start writing, keith.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.363
(mouse)
yo, olinsky, it's mouse.
Any luck in the bomb shelter?

22:45.365 --> 22:46.597
The what?

22:46.599 --> 22:49.066
Yeah, i just looked up
keith mcintire's house.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.001
County assessor says that
he's got a structure out back

22:51.003 --> 22:53.704
Like from the cold war days.
Legit bomb shelter.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.740
Wait a minute.
There's one more thing.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.508
Hello?

22:57.510 --> 22:58.976
You there? What--

22:58.978 --> 23:01.879
You got two seconds
to tell me what's going on

23:01.881 --> 23:04.915
Or i'll put you
on your ass!

23:19.699 --> 23:22.133
Open it.

23:22.135 --> 23:24.502
(olinsky)
open it!

23:31.411 --> 23:33.878
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

23:45.992 --> 23:49.560
Aaron mcintire?
Chicago police.

23:49.562 --> 23:52.630
I need you to step away
from the door.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.500
(mcintire)
where's my son?

23:56.502 --> 23:59.437
He's outside.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.005
Who sent you?!

24:01.007 --> 24:05.576
I'm a chicago police officer.
My partner is with your son.

24:05.578 --> 24:09.079
Now, step away and put
your hands over your head.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.855
I didn't tell anyone.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.893
(mcintire)
i was broke, okay?

24:22.895 --> 24:26.697
A driver i know hooked me up
with these guys, mexicans.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.666
I'd drive the trailer
down to texas,

24:28.668 --> 24:30.601
They put me up in a hotel.

24:30.603 --> 24:31.802
They load the trailer
the next day

24:31.804 --> 24:33.070
And i just drive it
back up here.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.105
2 million in heroin
each time.

24:35.107 --> 24:39.710
I never see what's in the back.
It's sealed.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.979
I'm coming clean here.
I-i am.

24:41.981 --> 24:46.817
Oh, then tell me about
those two kids you shot dead.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.253
I never drive with my gun.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.689
I didn't shoot those kids.

24:51.691 --> 24:55.559
All right, so then
how come they're dead?

24:55.561 --> 24:57.595
This time it was different.

24:57.597 --> 25:01.732
I get down to texas
and there's this--this psycho.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.834
They want him to ride with me,
for security.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.236
Must have been
a bigger load.

25:05.238 --> 25:08.606
This killer rides in the cab
all the way back with me.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.975
Doesn't say two words.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.978
So your story is the mystery
mexican shot those boys.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.113
Like it was nothing.

25:16.115 --> 25:19.683
He's probably out there
looking for that third kid.

25:27.527 --> 25:30.227
That's him.

25:30.229 --> 25:33.664
You gonna find
this psycho?

25:33.666 --> 25:36.634
No. You are.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.637
We got some photos
for you to look at.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.073
- You got it?
- Yeah.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.663
Wow.

25:48.664 --> 25:50.548
Sherri gifford, you're late
to pick up your niece.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.683
Hey.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.922
I got a lot going on today.
My nephew got killed. I--

25:57.924 --> 26:01.859
Look at me.
Look at me.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.128
Hey, denise, will you
go sit in my chair?

26:04.130 --> 26:05.729
Can i try your pen?

26:05.731 --> 26:08.132
Yeah, you can try my pen.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.067
Come here, please.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.871
Are you using?
Currently?

26:13.873 --> 26:15.272
Search me, officer.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.808
Yeah, it's sergeant, and i'd
rather you take a piss test.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.878
Yeah, you walk into
my district high on drugs.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.880
Happens all the time,
but not to people

26:22.882 --> 26:24.214
I'm about to entrust
with a minor.

26:24.216 --> 26:25.683
How'd you get here?

26:25.685 --> 26:28.886
I drove my car, paid for,
thank you very much.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.738
Wrong answer.

26:30.739 --> 26:32.589
You are not transporting
that girl in your vehicle.

26:32.592 --> 26:35.192
This is the last thing
i wanted to do,

26:35.194 --> 26:37.595
But i'm gonna have
dcfs take denise.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.630
You're not taking that child
away from me.

26:39.632 --> 26:40.731
Dee dee, let's go.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.733
Is that a threat?
I feel unsafe.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.868
Do i need to have you
escorted out?

26:44.870 --> 26:47.137
Look, dee dee needs her family.
Dee dee, let's go!

26:47.139 --> 26:48.706
Honestly?
She can do better.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.375
Dee dee, let's go!

27:01.988 --> 27:05.189
Oh, she's all yours.

27:06.892 --> 27:09.860
Hey, wow.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.795
You look good up there.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.933
Thanks for not making me
go with my aunt sherri.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.402
Sure.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.771
But where do i go now?

27:20.773 --> 27:24.975
Hey, sweetheart, we're working
on that, okay?

27:28.114 --> 27:29.246
[knock on door]

27:29.248 --> 27:30.247
Yeah.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.850
I wanted you to see this.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.318
I kept digging
into charles,

27:34.320 --> 27:36.954
And we found his phone
along with his wallet.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.123
Mouse recovered some
deleted photos from it.

27:39.125 --> 27:42.026
He's throwing gang signs.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.937
(michelle)
that must be two years ago.
Look how skinny he is.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.706
He was just messing around,

27:55.708 --> 27:57.207
I think it was, like,
halloween or something.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.742
- Halloween?
- Yeah.

27:58.744 --> 28:02.146
So you're saying he's pretending
to be a gangbanger.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.714
That was two years ago.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.249
That's why i got us
outta there.

28:05.251 --> 28:08.686
I got an entire unit
searching the city for him.

28:08.688 --> 28:11.755
I told my team
he was a good kid.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.066
You went looking for him?

28:22.068 --> 28:24.168
No.

28:24.169 --> 28:26.269
Or did you go visit him?
You got him stashed somewhere?

28:26.272 --> 28:27.871
Look, i-i-i went
to the store!

28:27.873 --> 28:30.007
I told you do one thing!

28:30.009 --> 28:32.009
I said tell me the truth.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.111
Look, i did!

28:34.113 --> 28:36.013
I'm putting my neck out
for you, michelle.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.948
You understand that?

28:47.993 --> 28:49.993
You!

28:49.995 --> 28:51.462
In here, right now.

28:51.464 --> 28:53.130
Which one of us?

28:53.132 --> 28:54.498
Oh, i'll get to you two.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.433
You. What's your name?

28:56.435 --> 28:58.102
Nadia, sir.

29:01.207 --> 29:04.808
Wanna make sure i got this.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.847
- Burgess.
- Yes.

29:09.849 --> 29:12.783
You've been in
multiple car accidents,

29:12.785 --> 29:15.319
The two of you had a squad
blown up by an arsonist,

29:15.321 --> 29:17.421
And now this trip
to the firing range.

29:17.423 --> 29:21.525
This is not avis.
These cars cost.

29:21.527 --> 29:24.762
Action finds us, sarge.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.330
Get out of my face.

29:26.332 --> 29:29.399
I'll deal with fischer.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.036
I don't think--

29:33.038 --> 29:36.073
Go!

29:37.443 --> 29:38.876
(lindsay)
truck driver id'd this guy.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.311
Octavio ramirez is our gunman.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.881
He hit on both fbi
and ice databases.

29:43.883 --> 29:46.383
Wanted for multiple drug-related
murders in durango.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.085
If his job was to secure
that shipment,

29:48.087 --> 29:49.953
You better believe he's
looking for charles gray.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.421
He got to send a message.
[phone buzzes]

29:51.423 --> 29:53.423
This is good work--you put out
an investigative alert.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.193
And got the fbi to add him
to chicago's most wanted.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.828
(voight)
yeah.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.364
Look, slow down.

30:01.567 --> 30:04.501
It's okay.
I'm on my way.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.373
He's in there.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.443
If i didn't help,
they were gonna kill mom.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.045
(michelle)
we got to get him
to a hospital.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.848
We can't.

30:17.850 --> 30:21.251
He goes in, he's in the system,
there's nothing i can do.

30:22.955 --> 30:23.954
Yeah, where you at?

30:23.956 --> 30:24.988
[whispers]
it's okay.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.090
It's charles. He came home.

30:29.495 --> 30:32.262
I need your brother.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.164
Will's an awesome surgeon.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.434
He's worked in worse
conditions than this.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.604
Darius rolled up,
and i couldn't disrespect him.

30:40.606 --> 30:43.841
He said we were going
for a ride.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.275
Didn't mention any robbery.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.444
(will)
okay, what we're looking at--

30:47.446 --> 30:50.113
Two large caliber gunshots
to the right shoulder.

30:50.115 --> 30:53.183
Charles, nice work. Cvs?

30:53.185 --> 30:55.919
- Walgreens.
- My man.

30:55.921 --> 30:57.354
Can you get 'em out?

30:57.356 --> 31:00.490
No problem. Leave you
some badass scars, too.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.462
(charles)
i said i wasn't robbing anyone.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.631
They said if i didn't drive off
with that truck,

31:07.633 --> 31:09.333
They'd come after mom.

31:09.335 --> 31:11.201
You're safe now, baby.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.536
All right,
who's assisting me?

31:12.538 --> 31:13.938
I got you. I will.

31:13.939 --> 31:15.339
Go in my bag, get the suture,
load the lidocaine.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.207
I need a scalpel
and small forceps

31:17.209 --> 31:19.343
And whatever gauze
is in there.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.611
Here's your gauze.

31:20.613 --> 31:21.912
Thank you.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.513
Here's the kit.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.549
All right, this is
gonna hurt, charles,

31:25.551 --> 31:27.150
But i need to open
up that wound

31:27.152 --> 31:30.220
So we can get those slugs out
and stop the bleeding.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.558
Lidocaine.
[charles grunting]

31:34.560 --> 31:37.961
All right, scalpel.
Here we go.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.465
- I know. I know--gauze.
- [groaning]

31:41.467 --> 31:43.600
That's it. I know.
You're doing great.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.669
- Okay.
- More gauze here.

31:45.671 --> 31:49.039
Michelle, sit down.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.641
- Needle driver.

31:50.643 --> 31:53.977
Ah, all right, got it.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.350
- [groans]
- it's all right.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.919
A lot of pressure
just got released.

32:01.921 --> 32:03.220
Suture.

32:05.057 --> 32:08.926
All right, stitching
the wound closed.

32:08.928 --> 32:11.361
All right,

32:11.363 --> 32:15.032
Okay, jay, lidocaine.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.082
Got it.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.484
[charles groans]

32:34.486 --> 32:36.420

All right.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.322
Here we go.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.042

32:59.044 --> 33:00.510
(voight)
it's ramirez.
He's not alone.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.245
Get him down in the basement.

33:02.247 --> 33:04.281
I can't--second bullet
nicked an artery.

33:04.283 --> 33:07.384
Look, they're coming.
At least one out back.

33:11.623 --> 33:14.224
Will. Will!

33:14.226 --> 33:17.594
If i move him now,
he'll bleed to death.

33:17.596 --> 33:20.330
I need to tie off
this artery.

33:23.068 --> 33:24.167
[glass shatters]

33:24.169 --> 33:25.435
- Will!
- They're here.

33:25.437 --> 33:26.603
(halstead)
someone's upstairs.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.739
(will)
almost there.

33:28.741 --> 33:30.741
All right, and done.
Let's go.

33:30.743 --> 33:32.342
- On your feet.
- Come on.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.411
There you go.
You got him?

33:34.413 --> 33:37.047
Oh, i got him.
All right, you're good.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.016

Aah. Aah!

35:23.622 --> 35:26.289
[crash]

35:46.211 --> 35:47.711
Clear.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.380
(voight)
hey, doc,

35:50.382 --> 35:51.781
Yeah,

35:51.783 --> 35:54.184
All right.
You're safe now.

35:56.188 --> 35:58.205
He gonna live?

35:58.206 --> 36:00.223
He's gonna be fine.
I just want to pack the wound.

36:00.225 --> 36:01.258
Come on, give me a hand.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.426
All right.
We got you.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.333
I blew it.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.902
(lindsay)
no, you didn't.

36:11.904 --> 36:13.570
Are you kidding me?

36:13.572 --> 36:15.939
Patrol is gonna be telling
that story for years.

36:15.941 --> 36:18.909
Commander fischer
screamed at me.

36:18.911 --> 36:20.744
In intelligence,

36:20.746 --> 36:24.514
That usually just means
you're doing your job.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.950
What the hell
was i thinking?

36:26.952 --> 36:29.586
You weren't.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.888
Your instincts took over,
all right.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.924
And they're good instincts.

36:33.926 --> 36:35.859
You backed up roman
and burgess.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.929
You stopped those two clowns
before they got away.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.634
What do you want to do?

36:44.636 --> 36:48.471
Do you want to keep
answering phones?

36:48.473 --> 36:50.640
'cause it doesn't matter
to me either way.

36:50.642 --> 36:53.710
I want what you want.

36:57.649 --> 37:01.952
I want to be
a chicago police officer.

37:01.954 --> 37:04.788
Let's do it then.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.857
I got your back.

37:13.265 --> 37:15.765
You can keep the pen.
You want it?

37:15.767 --> 37:17.601
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.738
You listen up.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.708
You be brave, okay?

37:24.710 --> 37:27.611
And i will see you
very soon.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.379
Be good.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.948
Okay. Okay.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.685
Bye, sweetie.

37:35.687 --> 37:38.922
You be good, okay?

37:50.469 --> 37:55.272
Hey, so how much of what
went down tonight was,

37:55.274 --> 37:57.807
You know...

37:57.809 --> 38:00.910
We're a specialized unit.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.283
Well, i'm thinking about
sticking around.

38:07.386 --> 38:10.387
I talked to someone
at chicago med.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.289
They need er doctors.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.891
Whoa,
no more breast implants.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.660
Son of a...

38:16.662 --> 38:18.595
I did cleft palates, too.

38:18.597 --> 38:21.431
But no one mentions
the cleft palates.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.632
My bad.

38:22.634 --> 38:23.800
It was fun for a while,

38:23.802 --> 38:26.903
But, you know,
new york wasn't me.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.739
I did three years of
touching up rich men's wives

38:29.741 --> 38:32.542
And not a minute meant as much
as the work i did overseas.

38:32.544 --> 38:36.413
Then why'd you bail
on the gig in sudan?

38:36.415 --> 38:38.882
They threw money at me.

38:38.884 --> 38:42.519
Plus things went south
with a girl.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.421
Samara.
Oh...

38:44.423 --> 38:45.955
If you could have
seen her, man.

38:45.957 --> 38:49.025
Most beautiful girl
i ever met in my life.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.997
You should have been here.

38:55.801 --> 38:59.669
Mom was dying,
you were off partying.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.912
You left.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.748
I left to fight a war.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.584
I came home.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.424
I saw dad.

39:21.426 --> 39:25.562
He, uh, said you haven't
spoken in a year.

39:25.564 --> 39:28.631
Probably two.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.375
That was the first tip
your mom ever gave me.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.410
Probably saved four lives.

39:40.412 --> 39:42.846
It was a big win
for the gang unit and me.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.648
So i'm like, you know,
"let's go out someplace nice

39:45.650 --> 39:47.384
And celebrate."

39:47.386 --> 39:49.552
She suggests the minnow.

39:49.554 --> 39:54.090
I'm like, "no, i mean, someplace
nice, with steaks. Gibson's."

39:54.092 --> 39:56.159
- She's like--
- i like the minnow.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.094
I say, "michelle, i've been
to the minnow twice,

39:58.096 --> 39:59.496
"got sick two times.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.965
And the drinks are worse
than the food."

40:01.967 --> 40:03.833
Course,
little did i know--

40:03.835 --> 40:06.136
Auntie francine
owns the minnow.

40:10.876 --> 40:13.543
But your mom did things
for the right reasons.

40:13.545 --> 40:17.180
Never took a nickel
when she needed it most.

40:17.182 --> 40:20.717
Kept you safe in a place where
a lot of people go under.

40:20.719 --> 40:25.422
So i understand what you did
to protect her.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.824
You guys coming or going?

40:27.826 --> 40:29.159
They're coming, i'm going.

40:29.161 --> 40:31.428
Okay then,
you have an awesome day.

40:31.430 --> 40:32.762
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

40:38.036 --> 40:41.104
Enough to get you and your mom
on your feet.

40:43.008 --> 40:44.641
Okay.

40:52.717 --> 40:54.751
Thanks for everything.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.453
Thank you.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.888
Well, you two take care
of each other.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.023
Yeah, you too.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.991
All right.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.993
Wait, i don't get it.

41:06.898 --> 41:10.133
Why do you do it?

41:10.135 --> 41:13.770
Help people
like me and my mom.

41:13.772 --> 41:16.840
You know, i never really
thought about it.
