39:39.077 --> 39:41.378

he's happy. He's content.

39:41.380 --> 39:44.381
He was never meant
to be happy.

39:44.383 --> 39:47.684
Happy, content men
don't run the world,

39:47.686 --> 39:50.687
Which is why
he is not running the world.

39:50.689 --> 39:54.224
He does whatever you say,
without question.

39:54.226 --> 39:58.161
You have pulled off
a clean, bloodless coup

39:58.163 --> 40:01.898
In the united states of america,
and no one is the wiser.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.000
That is one
for the history books.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.668
I know
this is difficult for you,

40:05.670 --> 40:07.504
Because you seem to be
so unfamiliar

40:07.506 --> 40:08.705
With how humans behave,

40:08.707 --> 40:11.775
But cyrus,
fitz and i together --

40:11.777 --> 40:14.244
We have
an actual relationship.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.880
This is
what a couple looks like.

40:16.882 --> 40:20.016
You have the oval.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.952
This is

40:35.901 --> 40:38.301
Hey. I thought you were
going back to the office.

40:38.303 --> 40:39.369
I changed my mind.

40:39.371 --> 40:41.204
Everything okay?

40:41.206 --> 40:42.806
Yeah.

40:42.808 --> 40:43.873
Well,
i am buried in work.

40:43.875 --> 40:46.276
This country never sleeps.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.478
I just got off the phone
with the state department.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.247
Germany and japan don't want
turkey at the g20 meeting.

40:51.249 --> 40:53.883
If turkey comes,
they won't come.

40:53.885 --> 40:56.386
Also, the democrats refuse
to negotiate

40:56.388 --> 40:57.487
With the republicans

40:57.489 --> 40:59.389
On key parts
of the spending bill.

40:59.391 --> 41:01.224
The governors of nevada
and california

41:01.226 --> 41:02.559
Are about to start
some kind of civil war

41:02.561 --> 41:05.161
Over the healthcare
of illegal immigrants.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.963
Basically,
nobody wants to come

41:06.965 --> 41:08.832
To anybody else's
slumber party.

41:08.834 --> 41:09.899
Then there's your father.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.842
What about him?

41:18.844 --> 41:21.778
That man is nowhere.

41:21.780 --> 41:25.348
I don't think
we're ever gonna find him.

41:25.350 --> 41:30.553
Sorry, liv, but it looks
like he's disappeared for good.

41:44.202 --> 41:46.202
[ sighs ]

41:53.812 --> 41:55.144
You should remind germany
and japan

41:55.146 --> 41:56.779
That this is your party,
not theirs.

41:56.781 --> 41:57.881
You are the host,
not them.

41:57.883 --> 42:00.183
They attend
or they get no vote.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.384
Yes, that's good.

42:01.386 --> 42:02.418
And tell the speaker
you're gonna meet with her

42:02.420 --> 42:04.153
And the most
senior house members.

42:04.155 --> 42:05.688
I already have a meeting --
you have
a meeting scheduled

42:05.690 --> 42:07.290
With the congressional
progressive caucus this week.

42:07.292 --> 42:08.958
Cancel it. That's too many cooks
in the kitchen.

42:08.960 --> 42:09.959
It should just be you,
the speaker,

42:09.961 --> 42:10.960
And the minority whip.

42:10.962 --> 42:12.161
That's it.
All right.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.230
I'll have charlotte set it up
right now.

42:14.232 --> 42:16.032
And have david rosen
call the governor of nevada.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.467
Maybe he doesn't
want to be re-elected.

42:17.469 --> 42:19.135
Maybe he wants to be
investigated.
