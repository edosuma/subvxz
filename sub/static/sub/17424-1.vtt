Mrs. Anderson.

02:35.454 --> 02:37.189
Olivia.

02:37.223 --> 02:38.725
Your pills.

Subrip by DanDee

03:09.754 --> 03:12.625
<i>It is important
to understand about dying</i>

03:12.657 --> 03:14.459
<i>that even though in general</i>

03:14.492 --> 03:17.263
<i>you do not have a personal
choice in the matter,</i>

03:17.295 --> 03:19.564
<i>it is going to happen to you
when it happens to you.</i>

03:19.598 --> 03:21.434
<i>There are reasons you die.</i>

03:22.568 --> 03:24.370
<i>There are causes,</i>

03:24.402 --> 03:28.373
<i>a chain of events
linked by causality,</i>

03:28.407 --> 03:30.475
<i>and those events
include decisions</i>

03:30.508 --> 03:34.579
<i>that you have
personally made.</i>

03:34.612 --> 03:37.883
<i>How did you end up here,
on this exact day,</i>

03:37.915 --> 03:39.985
<i>at this exact time,</i>

03:40.019 --> 03:43.890
<i>with this specific event
happening to you?</i>

04:05.510 --> 04:06.545
Hey!

04:35.908 --> 04:38.544
<i>May our mourners rise.</i>

04:41.447 --> 04:44.750
<i>Today we mourn the loss
of young Jonah Greenberg,</i>

04:44.783 --> 04:47.753
fallen in Korea,
fighting for his country,

04:47.786 --> 04:49.622
at 19 years of age.

04:49.654 --> 04:51.690
<i>Moses Greenberg,</i>

04:51.723 --> 04:54.959
<i>please, to recite
the kaddish.</i>

04:57.463 --> 04:58.597
Amen.

05:08.673 --> 05:09.641
Amen.

05:29.595 --> 05:30.563
Mm-hmm?

05:33.165 --> 05:34.633
Yeah, sure.

05:34.665 --> 05:35.935
Ah.

05:35.968 --> 05:37.603
Hi, Mrs. Greenberg.

05:37.636 --> 05:39.105
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

05:39.137 --> 05:41.539
Ah, yes, Marcus.

05:41.572 --> 05:44.543
You're such
a clever boy.

05:44.576 --> 05:47.480
Jonah, he... he always
looked up to you.

05:47.512 --> 05:49.048
Maybe not
such close friends,

05:49.081 --> 05:51.917
but he respected...

05:51.949 --> 05:53.519
We were teammates.

05:53.552 --> 05:55.521
He was
a really good guy.

05:55.553 --> 05:57.489
Baseball.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.958
He enjoyed...

06:00.692 --> 06:01.793
Marcus...

06:01.826 --> 06:03.396
don't go into this war,

06:03.428 --> 06:05.798
<i>for your parents' sake.</i>

06:05.831 --> 06:08.033
<i>You should be
a baseball star.</i>

06:08.065 --> 06:09.901
<i>Don't go
into this draft.</i>

06:09.935 --> 06:12.670
He's going
to college, Miriam.

06:12.704 --> 06:15.375
They keep the ones in college
from the draft.

06:16.475 --> 06:19.677
Such a clever boy,
Marcus.

06:19.711 --> 06:21.847
A scholarship,
is that right?

06:21.879 --> 06:24.850
Yes. In Ohio,
this college is.

06:24.882 --> 06:26.952
Ohio?

06:29.187 --> 06:31.089
How will you
keep kosher?

06:37.095 --> 06:40.666
<i>Only one thing worse than dying
by getting stabbed with a bayonet,</i>

06:40.699 --> 06:41.669
and that's dying by

06:41.670 --> 06:43.670
getting stabbed with a
bayonet when you're still a virgin.

06:43.701 --> 06:45.937
And Greenberg was
definitely a virgin.

06:45.971 --> 06:48.607
Oh, yeah? I thought maybe
you and Greenberg

06:48.639 --> 06:50.575
had taken care of each other
before he shipped out.

06:50.608 --> 06:52.144
Shut up, asshole.

06:52.177 --> 06:54.680
So, uh...

06:54.713 --> 06:57.082
when do you report?

06:58.115 --> 06:59.718
Two weeks.

07:01.052 --> 07:03.755
Ah, you'll be okay.

07:03.788 --> 07:05.957
You're smarter
than Greenberg.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.860
Not as smart as you.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.084
Mrs. Davidovich.
Two chickens?

07:32.117 --> 07:33.686
Let me see.

07:33.718 --> 07:35.153
Of course. Markie!

07:35.187 --> 07:37.723
<i>Flick two chickens for
Mrs. Davidovich, will ya?</i>

07:40.892 --> 07:41.893
Turn 'em around.

07:44.228 --> 07:45.630
Yeah.

07:45.663 --> 07:48.800
I'll wrap them for you.

07:48.834 --> 07:52.103
So what will you do when
this one goes off next month?

07:52.137 --> 07:54.807
The Mrs. will help,
like the old days.

07:54.839 --> 07:57.943
<i>I can't keep him here
chopping meat like me.</i>

08:13.057 --> 08:15.260
I have to go
see Gurevich.

08:15.293 --> 08:17.996
You can
close up early.

08:18.029 --> 08:20.899
Oh, and bring home some brisket
for your mother.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.735
I told you, Dad,

08:23.769 --> 08:26.739
I'm going out with Davey
and Sam tonight.

08:26.771 --> 08:27.939
You didn't tell me.

08:27.973 --> 08:29.108
Mm-hmm. I told you,

08:29.141 --> 08:30.709
we're going
to the pictures.

08:30.742 --> 08:32.945
To the pictures.

08:32.977 --> 08:35.046
I know what
you boys are doing.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.649
I heard
from Mrs. Pearlgreen

08:36.682 --> 08:39.552
about that Eddie
going to pool halls.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.787
Dad, I'm going
to the pictures.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.222
I, I told you.

08:43.254 --> 08:45.090
I'm... I'm not
Eddie Pearlgreen, for Christ's sake.

08:45.123 --> 08:46.859
I don't even know
how to play pool.

08:46.892 --> 08:48.260
He took
his father's car,

08:48.293 --> 08:49.995
drove all the way
to Scranton,

08:50.028 --> 08:52.664
to some special pool hall
they have there.

08:52.697 --> 08:55.000
He bets. He gambles.

08:55.033 --> 08:57.269
His father says he'll be
stealing cars next.

08:57.302 --> 08:59.337
W... What does Eddie Pearlgreen
have to do with me?

08:59.370 --> 09:02.707
Dad, I'm... I'm leaving
in less than a month.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.309
You think I'm tempted
to steal cars?

09:58.296 --> 09:59.765
Markie?

10:01.066 --> 10:02.601
Ma?

10:04.001 --> 10:06.904
Everything okay?
What's going on?

10:06.937 --> 10:08.874
Your father.

10:08.907 --> 10:10.309
What happened?

10:10.341 --> 10:13.111
He went out
looking for you.

10:13.144 --> 10:15.346
<i>He was worried.</i>

10:15.379 --> 10:17.081
He's been talking
to Artie Pearlgreen again.

10:17.115 --> 10:18.850
It got him all riled up.

10:18.884 --> 10:20.853
I think he smoked three packs
of cigarettes. Then he went.

10:20.885 --> 10:23.322
What's happening
to him, Ma?

10:23.355 --> 10:26.125
What's the matter
with him? He's crazy.

10:26.158 --> 10:28.159
He's driving me crazy.
He's driving you crazy.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.360
<i>It's your leaving.</i>

10:29.394 --> 10:30.962
It's all the boys dying,

10:30.995 --> 10:32.364
Bennie and Abe
in the last war,

10:32.397 --> 10:33.966
now this new war.
I don't know.

10:33.999 --> 10:36.034
He's worried about you.
He's worried about Ohio.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.310
So, there you are.

10:46.344 --> 10:49.381
Yeah, strange.
Here I am in my own house.

10:49.413 --> 10:51.182
I have been everywhere
looking for you.

10:51.216 --> 10:53.018
Oh, why? Why? Why?

10:53.051 --> 10:54.453
Somebody, tell me why.

10:54.485 --> 10:56.288
<i>Because if anything
were to happen to you...</i>

10:56.321 --> 10:57.723
Oh, come on.

10:57.755 --> 10:59.824
If anything were
to ever happen to you...

10:59.857 --> 11:02.126
What is this all about?

11:02.159 --> 11:04.462
It's about life, Markie.

11:04.495 --> 11:06.164
It's about
the tiniest mistake

11:06.197 --> 11:07.466
that can
have consequences.

11:07.499 --> 11:09.768
Oh, Christ. You sound
like a fortune cookie.

11:09.801 --> 11:11.870
Do I?
Like a fortune cookie?

11:11.903 --> 11:14.072
<i>Not like
the concerned father that I am,</i>

11:14.105 --> 11:15.474
<i>but like
a fortune cookie?</i>

11:15.506 --> 11:18.076
I can't take this anymore.
I can't take this.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.745
You know what?
Thank God I'm leaving.

11:19.778 --> 11:22.346
Thank God,
so I don't end up...

11:22.379 --> 11:25.283
What? End up what?

11:25.317 --> 11:28.453
I don't know.
I don't know.

11:58.015 --> 11:59.851
Maybe I shouldn't go.

12:02.187 --> 12:04.255
No.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.457
Come on.

12:08.159 --> 12:09.461
You go.

12:15.366 --> 12:18.203
You gotta stop worrying.
It's scaring Ma.

12:23.207 --> 12:24.809
You go.

12:25.876 --> 12:28.479
Just...

12:28.513 --> 12:30.182
be careful.

13:10.322 --> 13:11.889
<i>Everything's in the envelope.</i>

13:11.923 --> 13:13.558
You're in Jenkins 211.

13:13.591 --> 13:15.860
That's behind the men's quad,
back towards the gym.

13:15.894 --> 13:18.864
Keys are in there, and check
your class schedule in there, too.

13:18.897 --> 13:20.566
And looks like you're
doing a campus job.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.367
The job board's
right over there.

13:22.399 --> 13:24.903
Just take a ticket down from
the board for the job you want,

13:24.936 --> 13:26.437
and turn it back in
with the form.

13:26.471 --> 13:29.408
I'd go now. Otherwise,
all that's left is the dining hall.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.972
Hi. Marcus Messner.

14:01.005 --> 14:03.107
Hey. Ron Foxman.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.610
That's Bert Flusser.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.245
Where you from?

14:07.278 --> 14:08.647
- Newark.
- Where's that?

14:08.679 --> 14:11.250
- New Jersey.
- Right.

14:11.283 --> 14:12.651
Cleveland, Ohio.

14:12.683 --> 14:14.385
Flusser's
from Chicago.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.987
<i>He's, uh...</i>

14:16.020 --> 14:18.356
cultured.

14:18.389 --> 14:19.957
You'll see.

14:19.990 --> 14:22.360
Oh yeah?
Does Flusser talk?

14:22.394 --> 14:24.196
Oh, I talk all right.

14:24.229 --> 14:25.597
I even talk
in my sleep.

14:25.629 --> 14:27.432
I have so much to say,

14:27.465 --> 14:29.368
so much to share
with the world.

14:31.970 --> 14:34.206
Young freshman
Marcus Messner

14:34.239 --> 14:36.074
from Newark,
New Jersey.

14:36.106 --> 14:39.677
What a surprise to find yourself
in a triple with two other Jews.

14:39.711 --> 14:41.446
What a coincidence.

14:41.479 --> 14:44.149
Ronald and I are the only two Jews
at Winesburg

14:44.182 --> 14:45.951
<i>who are not
in the Jewish fraternity.</i>

14:45.984 --> 14:48.353
After all,
we are juniors.

14:48.385 --> 14:51.355
We ought to be living in style
over at Zeta Tau Mu,

14:51.389 --> 14:54.058
not bunking
with young freshman,

14:54.091 --> 14:56.028
Marcus Messner.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.697
# All of us with one heart #

14:59.730 --> 15:02.134
# With the torch
of freedom #

15:02.167 --> 15:04.670
<i># March on, march on #</i>

15:04.702 --> 15:08.406
# March on and on #

15:08.440 --> 15:12.411
# Cheelai, Cheelai,
Cheelai... #

15:12.443 --> 15:15.112
Bert, close the door
at least.

15:18.216 --> 15:20.318
Ronald doesn't
like Negro Communists,

15:20.351 --> 15:21.653
Paul Robeson
in particular.

15:21.686 --> 15:23.989
He doesn't like music
at all, in fact.

15:24.022 --> 15:26.158
If Dean Caudwell ever heard you
playing that commie propaganda,

15:26.191 --> 15:27.591
he'd probably toss you
right out of here.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.061
Dean Caudwell loves me.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.462
Dean Caudwell?

15:30.495 --> 15:32.063
<i>Bert:
Dean of Men.</i>

15:32.096 --> 15:36.300
And a man among deans,
if I do say so myself.

15:36.333 --> 15:39.303
In fact,
he's addressing us

15:39.336 --> 15:40.672
in 15 minutes.

15:40.705 --> 15:43.475
Oh, shit. Chapel.

15:43.508 --> 15:45.076
Uh...

15:45.110 --> 15:46.211
Chapel?

15:46.244 --> 15:48.312
Yeah. Didn't you
read the handbook?

15:48.346 --> 15:50.282
Required.
Every Wednesday at 11:00.

15:50.315 --> 15:51.984
You have to go to at least 10
of them a year

15:52.017 --> 15:53.185
if you want to graduate.

15:53.217 --> 15:55.453
Might as well
get started today.

15:58.023 --> 16:01.426
To you who join us today
for the first time,

16:01.458 --> 16:05.429
to you who enter
your final year

16:05.462 --> 16:09.201
looking out at the prospect
of what may seem to be

16:09.234 --> 16:12.137
an uncertain
and dangerous horizon,

16:12.169 --> 16:14.705
menaced as this country
may be

16:14.739 --> 16:18.509
by enemies
both foreign and native,

16:18.543 --> 16:20.379
fear not,

16:20.412 --> 16:23.248
puzzle not,

16:23.280 --> 16:26.017
hesitate not,

16:26.051 --> 16:28.620
for the spirit of Winesburg

16:28.653 --> 16:33.425
will animate
and fortify you.

16:33.457 --> 16:37.629
And now, Dr. Donehower
will lead us in prayer.

16:45.537 --> 16:49.708
<i>Righteous God,
who rules the nations,</i>

16:49.740 --> 16:53.711
<i>we pray that you guard all
the strong young men and women</i>

16:53.745 --> 16:56.480
<i>who enter the gates
of Winesburg College</i>

16:56.514 --> 17:00.752
<i>in the service of greater
knowledge and greater strength.</i>

17:00.784 --> 17:03.355
<i>To our fellow Winesburgians
currently serving</i>

17:03.388 --> 17:05.323
<i>the cause of freedom
in Korea...</i>

17:37.689 --> 17:40.159
<i>Order, arms.</i>

17:42.826 --> 17:44.730
Left shoulder, arms.

17:47.765 --> 17:49.802
Order, arms.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.708
Yes?

17:56.740 --> 17:58.309
<i>Call from
Marcus Messner.</i>

17:58.343 --> 17:59.711
Yes, I'll accept
the charges.

17:59.743 --> 18:01.645
Marcus? Marcus, honey?

18:01.679 --> 18:03.215
Yes, Mom. I'm here.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.584
<i>You sound tired.
Are you tired?</i>

18:05.616 --> 18:07.519
No, I'm not too tired.
I'm just busy.

18:07.551 --> 18:09.320
Tell me
about your classes.

18:09.354 --> 18:10.889
Have you gotten
any grades yet?

18:10.922 --> 18:12.691
<i>It's only been
two weeks, Ma.</i>

18:12.723 --> 18:16.260
<i>I've got an American History
paper due tomorrow.</i>

18:16.294 --> 18:18.263
Hold on. Your father
wants to talk...

18:18.296 --> 18:20.798
So, Marcus, what else?
What else is going on?

18:20.832 --> 18:23.568
Studying. Studying and working
at the library.

18:23.601 --> 18:25.504
<i>What are you doing
to divert yourself?</i>

18:25.537 --> 18:27.538
Nothing, I don't
need diversions.

18:27.571 --> 18:29.140
I don't have
the time for them.

18:29.173 --> 18:31.542
Is there a girl
in the picture yet?

18:31.576 --> 18:33.144
<i>Not yet.</i>

18:33.178 --> 18:34.379
You be careful.

18:34.412 --> 18:35.547
<i>I will be.</i>

18:35.579 --> 18:36.780
You know
what I mean.

18:36.814 --> 18:38.316
Yep.

18:38.348 --> 18:39.817
<i>You don't want to get
into any trouble.</i>

18:39.851 --> 18:41.520
I won't, Dad. Stop.

18:41.553 --> 18:43.688
That Karpen boy,

18:43.721 --> 18:45.656
the army sent him home.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.359
They found out
he has flat feet.

18:47.392 --> 18:49.794
<i>Gershowitz gave him
a job at the grocery.</i>

18:49.826 --> 18:51.663
<i>First thing,
he's delivering the groceries</i>

18:51.695 --> 18:53.464
<i>and crashes the truck.</i>

18:53.498 --> 18:55.734
<i>His mother was
crying in the store for an hour,</i>

18:55.767 --> 18:57.635
<i>an hour...</i>

19:10.981 --> 19:12.550
You're
Marcus Messner, right?

19:12.584 --> 19:13.751
I'm Sonny,
Sonny Cottler.

19:13.785 --> 19:15.387
This is
Marty Ziegler.

19:15.420 --> 19:16.955
We're wondering
if you have a couple of minutes,

19:16.988 --> 19:18.757
maybe head over
to The Owl for a soda.

19:18.789 --> 19:20.357
What's this all about?

19:20.391 --> 19:21.625
We're with
Zeta Tau Mu,

19:21.659 --> 19:23.461
the Jewish fraternity
on campus.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.196
We'd love to talk
to you about rushing.

19:28.499 --> 19:31.202
Look, look, I'm sorry.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.538
I don't think I'm
gonna join a fraternity.

19:33.570 --> 19:36.307
Well,
you don't have to.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.876
Why don't you just come over to
the house for dinner some time?

19:38.910 --> 19:41.479
You can come tomorrow night.
It's roast beef night.

19:41.511 --> 19:43.581
You'll have a good meal,
you'll meet some of the brothers,

19:43.615 --> 19:45.217
and there's no obligation
to do anything else.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.818
No. I don't believe
in fraternities.

19:47.852 --> 19:48.987
Believe in them?

19:49.019 --> 19:50.654
What is there
to believe in?

19:50.688 --> 19:51.923
Couple of like-minded guys
get together

19:51.955 --> 19:53.390
for friendship
and camaraderie.

19:53.423 --> 19:54.792
We play sports together.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.760
We hold parties
and dances.

19:56.794 --> 19:58.363
We share our meals
together.

19:58.395 --> 20:00.397
Look, it can get
awfully lonely otherwise.

20:00.431 --> 20:02.000
You know that out
of 1,400 people on campus,

20:02.032 --> 20:03.601
less than 80 are Jewish?

20:03.634 --> 20:05.636
That's a pretty small
percentage.

20:05.670 --> 20:08.473
The only other fraternity that'll
have a Jew is the nonsectarian house,

20:08.506 --> 20:10.275
and they don't have
much going for them

20:10.307 --> 20:13.278
in the way of facilities
or really anything.

20:13.310 --> 20:15.346
I'm a senior, Marcus,
and president of the house.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.748
I don't want
to pressure you,

20:16.780 --> 20:18.349
but some of the brothers,
they've seen you around.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.651
They think you'd make
a great addition.

20:19.683 --> 20:21.752
They say you seem to be
a real scholar.

20:21.786 --> 20:24.489
Did you know that since Zeta Tau
was formed just 10 years ago,

20:24.521 --> 20:26.991
we've won the Interfraternity
Scholarship Cup five times,

20:27.025 --> 20:28.393
more than any other house?

20:28.425 --> 20:30.327
Sonny's being modest,
Marcus.

20:30.361 --> 20:32.530
He's actually the President of the
Interfraternity Council this year.

20:32.563 --> 20:33.965
Listen, that's great,

20:33.998 --> 20:35.700
and I appreciate
you coming around,

20:35.732 --> 20:38.269
but I'm not going to be
joining any fraternity.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.571
Can I ask why?

20:39.604 --> 20:42.407
I just...

20:42.440 --> 20:44.542
I have my job.
I have my studies.

20:44.575 --> 20:46.911
I'm just
not in the market

20:46.943 --> 20:49.681
for anything more
than that right now.

20:49.713 --> 20:51.282
Thank you, anyways.

20:51.316 --> 20:52.683
I hope you're
not offended.

20:52.717 --> 20:54.552
I'm not offended at all.

20:54.585 --> 20:56.554
I admire your
determination. Yeah.

20:56.586 --> 20:58.956
Give me a ring at the house if
you think about it some more

20:58.990 --> 21:00.759
or if you
need anything at all.

21:00.791 --> 21:04.461
And if you decide to stay for dinner,
all the better. Deal?

21:04.494 --> 21:06.664
Sure. Sure.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.367
All right.

21:11.702 --> 21:13.904
But the Puritans faced
a particular challenge,

21:13.938 --> 21:15.940
as, by the 1660s,

21:15.972 --> 21:17.741
the first generation
began to die out.

21:17.775 --> 21:20.512
<i>So in 1662,</i>

21:20.545 --> 21:22.681
the Reverend
Solomon Stoddard

21:22.713 --> 21:25.383
devised the so-called
Half-Way Covenant,

21:25.415 --> 21:26.784
whereby members
of the community

21:26.817 --> 21:28.752
<i>could be half-members
of the church</i>

21:28.786 --> 21:31.389
<i>if they agreed
to abide by its rules,</i>

21:31.422 --> 21:34.092
even if in their hearts
they could not profess

21:34.125 --> 21:37.061
a complete Puritan
conversion... Yes, Jack?

21:37.095 --> 21:39.096
So, go along
to get along.

21:39.130 --> 21:40.699
That's right.

21:40.731 --> 21:42.599
By allowing people
to stay part of the church

21:42.633 --> 21:44.436
and, by extension,
the community,

21:44.469 --> 21:46.904
<i>the Puritan leaders were
able to maintain authority</i>

21:46.938 --> 21:49.407
<i>and political
continuity. Yes?</i>

21:49.440 --> 21:51.109
Isn't that the same
kind of hypocrisy

21:51.142 --> 21:53.445
<i>the Puritans claimed
to rebel against?</i>

21:53.478 --> 21:56.748
Aren't they doing
the exact same thing

21:56.780 --> 21:58.048
<i>they accused
the Church of England of?</i>

21:58.082 --> 21:59.584
Well, Mr. Messner,

21:59.616 --> 22:00.984
"hypocrisy"
is a very strong word.

22:01.018 --> 22:02.953
It is a strong word,

22:02.987 --> 22:04.956
but as ironic as it appears,

22:04.989 --> 22:07.659
I believe it is a word
that accurately describes

22:07.692 --> 22:10.662
<i>the political position of the
Puritans of the second generation.</i>

22:10.694 --> 22:12.563
<i>Pragmatism...</i>

22:12.596 --> 22:15.099
<i>might be an even more
accurate term.</i>

22:15.133 --> 22:18.970
I do not now fool myself,
to let imagination...

22:19.002 --> 22:20.003
"...jade me."

22:20.037 --> 22:21.439
...jade me.

22:21.471 --> 22:23.942
for every reason
excites to this,

22:23.974 --> 22:26.009
that my lady loves me.

22:26.042 --> 22:28.746
She did commend
my yellow stockings of late,

22:28.779 --> 22:30.548
she did praise them
being cross-gartered;

22:30.580 --> 22:33.517
and in this she manifests
herself to my love,

22:33.550 --> 22:35.753
and with a kind
of injunction

22:35.787 --> 22:37.588
drives me to these habits
of her liking.

22:37.622 --> 22:39.958
I thank my stars
I am happy.

22:39.990 --> 22:43.827
Ah, I will be
strange, stout,

22:43.861 --> 22:45.797
in yellow stockings,
and cross-gartered,

22:45.829 --> 22:47.499
<i>even with the swiftness
of putting on.</i>

22:47.531 --> 22:49.166
<i>Jove and my stars
be praised!</i>

22:49.200 --> 22:51.836
I'll be revenged
on the whole pack of you.

22:51.868 --> 22:54.838
Well, Flusser's
a real star.

22:54.872 --> 22:56.908
You gonna come
see this thing?

22:56.941 --> 22:59.911
You know as well as I
Marcus is a scholar.

22:59.943 --> 23:03.615
He... He hasn't time
for frivolities like the theater.

23:18.729 --> 23:22.133
<i>What is it that pivots
or turns a person</i>

23:22.165 --> 23:24.601
<i>from existence
to nonexistence?</i>

23:24.634 --> 23:26.703
Thanks.

23:26.737 --> 23:28.139
<i>For myself,
perhaps it was</i>

23:28.172 --> 23:31.910
<i>the unceasing movement
of Olivia Hutton's leg.</i>

23:44.087 --> 23:46.924
<i>That night, I had
to stay up till 3:00 A.M.</i>

23:46.958 --> 23:48.893
<i>to finish the homework
I didn't get done</i>

23:48.925 --> 23:50.727
<i>while I was watching
that leg,</i>

23:50.760 --> 23:53.064
<i>rehearsing in my head</i>

23:53.096 --> 23:55.500
<i>how I would ask
my roommate Ron Foxman</i>

23:55.532 --> 23:59.471
<i>the loan of his beloved
1940 LaSalle Touring Sedan,</i>

23:59.503 --> 24:01.805
<i>building up the courage</i>

24:01.838 --> 24:04.842
<i>to ask Olivia Hutton out
on a date.</i>

24:07.111 --> 24:10.982
Weekday curfew
is 9:00 P.M. sharp.

24:11.015 --> 24:14.586
Okay, I will have her
back by then. Thank you.

24:14.618 --> 24:17.087
Why are you
thanking me?

24:17.121 --> 24:18.556
Sorry.

24:18.588 --> 24:21.058
And you're
sorry because?

24:21.092 --> 24:22.759
I...

24:22.792 --> 24:25.463
I'm just gonna...
just gonna sit.

25:11.208 --> 25:12.878
Thank you.

25:16.012 --> 25:17.581
<i>I don't mind
talking about it.</i>

25:17.615 --> 25:18.982
<i>They got divorced.</i>

25:19.016 --> 25:21.286
Irreconcilable
differences.

25:21.318 --> 25:22.921
I suppose that's why
I left Mount Holyoke

25:22.953 --> 25:24.989
and transferred here,
closer to Cleveland.

25:25.021 --> 25:26.223
My mother kept the house,

25:26.257 --> 25:27.625
but she changed
all the furnishings,

25:27.657 --> 25:29.026
even my room.

25:29.059 --> 25:31.194
It now looks like
Marie Antoinette's boudoir,

25:31.228 --> 25:33.664
if Marie Antoinette
were a slightly crazed suburban woman

25:33.698 --> 25:35.200
who wished she were
still a teenager.

25:37.201 --> 25:38.569
Oh.

25:40.337 --> 25:41.839
Thank you.

25:42.973 --> 25:45.009
Thank you.

25:47.044 --> 25:48.880
Escargot. It's the name
of the restaurant.

25:50.314 --> 25:52.050
Snails.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.718
I have a feeling
Marcus Messner

25:53.750 --> 25:55.720
has never seen them
served or eaten before.

25:55.752 --> 25:57.922
You want to try one?

25:57.954 --> 25:59.856
No. Not really.

25:59.890 --> 26:03.094
So Marcus Messner decided
to take Olivia Hutton

26:03.126 --> 26:07.097
to the only fancy French restaurant
in all of Franklin County.

26:07.131 --> 26:08.633
I, I'm so sorry.

26:08.665 --> 26:10.835
Do you want to leave?
Is this all right?

26:12.202 --> 26:14.338
Hey.

26:17.074 --> 26:19.677
Relax.

26:19.710 --> 26:21.846
You're so intense.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.749
Trust me. I'm trying.

26:26.884 --> 26:28.752
Tell me more.

26:28.786 --> 26:30.121
Not about your classes

26:30.153 --> 26:31.923
or why General MacArthur
is insubordinate

26:31.955 --> 26:33.323
or why you're
an atheist,

26:33.356 --> 26:35.125
though you have to admit
I got all of that out of you

26:35.159 --> 26:36.361
in a mere 20 minutes.

26:36.394 --> 26:38.028
Pretty good,
seeing as I don't believe

26:38.061 --> 26:40.130
you've spoken to anyone
for more than 40 seconds

26:40.163 --> 26:42.000
since you got to Winesburg.
Am I right?

26:42.032 --> 26:43.667
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.

26:43.701 --> 26:45.737
I want to hear
all about your mother

26:45.769 --> 26:47.137
and your father
the butcher

26:47.171 --> 26:48.940
and what it's like
working in a butcher shop,

26:48.972 --> 26:51.875
and what the girls
were like in Newark.

26:51.909 --> 26:53.645
Okay.
All right, but first,

26:53.678 --> 26:55.113
you're gonna have
to eat all those snails.

26:55.145 --> 26:58.115
Oh, you think I ordered
these just to spite you?

26:58.148 --> 27:00.217
I actually love escargot.

27:04.020 --> 27:05.789
All right.

27:05.823 --> 27:07.425
Let me try one.

27:07.458 --> 27:09.027
How do you do this?

27:09.059 --> 27:10.227
Which way do you...

27:10.260 --> 27:12.730
This big guy.

27:12.762 --> 27:13.932
Ooh.

27:17.934 --> 27:19.336
And?

27:20.371 --> 27:22.340
It's chewy,

27:22.373 --> 27:23.408
but good,

27:23.441 --> 27:24.675
very good.

27:24.709 --> 27:26.076
And you
grew up...

27:26.109 --> 27:27.277
eating these
at home?

27:27.310 --> 27:30.213
No, just at places
like these.

27:30.247 --> 27:33.116
My mother insisted,
a part of my education.

27:33.150 --> 27:35.120
So, what did your father
think?

27:37.253 --> 27:38.822
He's a steak
and potatoes man.

27:38.855 --> 27:40.191
He never approved.

27:40.223 --> 27:43.193
Maybe, you know,
being a doctor,

27:43.227 --> 27:46.431
he thought that snails
were unclean.

27:47.964 --> 27:50.467
Or simply un-American.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.003
But perhaps you're
onto something, Marcus.

27:53.037 --> 27:54.806
My father
washes his hands.

27:54.838 --> 27:56.273
He's always
washing his hands.

27:56.307 --> 27:57.909
He washes them
all the time.

27:57.942 --> 27:59.076
Why?

27:59.109 --> 28:02.112
Oh, because they're dirty,
of course.

28:12.990 --> 28:16.060
<i># Is it love? #</i>

28:17.094 --> 28:19.864
<i># Is it love? #</i>

28:19.896 --> 28:23.433
<i># Is it me standing here? #</i>

28:23.467 --> 28:26.871
<i># Is it real? #</i>

28:26.903 --> 28:28.506
<i># There's nothing... #</i>

28:28.538 --> 28:30.107
It's 55 minutes
to curfew,

28:30.141 --> 28:31.743
in case
you were wondering.

28:39.316 --> 28:42.185
<i># Is it sweet #</i>

28:42.219 --> 28:44.255
<i># If I dream... #</i>

28:44.288 --> 28:46.457
Make a left
at the next street.

28:46.490 --> 28:51.394
<i># And my dreams
have all come true... #</i>

29:11.848 --> 29:14.284
<i># What's the difference... #</i>

30:12.009 --> 30:13.376
<i>What happened next</i>

30:13.410 --> 30:16.380
<i>I puzzled over
for weeks afterwards,</i>

30:16.413 --> 30:18.950
<i>trying to reconstruct
the morals</i>

30:18.982 --> 30:21.885
<i>that reigned
over Winesburg College.</i>

30:21.919 --> 30:23.955
<i>And I wonder
how my own sorry efforts</i>

30:23.988 --> 30:26.257
<i>to overcome those morals
may have fostered</i>

30:26.289 --> 30:29.559
<i>so much misunderstanding,
even grief.</i>

30:53.683 --> 30:55.418
<i>Even now, I continue</i>

30:55.451 --> 30:58.256
<i>to puzzle
over Olivia's actions,</i>

30:58.288 --> 31:02.059
<i>hers and,
maybe even more so, mine.</i>

31:05.028 --> 31:08.298
<i>I told myself it's because
her parents are divorced.</i>

31:08.332 --> 31:10.268
<i>I could think
of no other explanation</i>

31:10.300 --> 31:12.436
<i>for a mystery so profound.</i>

31:14.438 --> 31:17.307
<i>Because in Newark,</i>

31:17.340 --> 31:19.142
<i>it was inconceivable</i>

31:19.175 --> 31:22.145
<i>that girls like Olivia Hutton
could do such a thing.</i>

31:22.179 --> 31:25.149
<i>But then again,
there were no girls</i>

31:25.182 --> 31:27.652
<i>like Olivia Hutton
in Newark.</i>

32:02.353 --> 32:04.087
Thanks for the loan.

32:05.521 --> 32:06.723
How did she run?

32:06.757 --> 32:08.159
Hmm?

32:08.192 --> 32:11.028
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Great. Thank you.

32:11.060 --> 32:12.362
Yeah, she should have.

32:12.395 --> 32:15.231
Next I'm gonna be
working on the suspension.

32:15.265 --> 32:16.734
It's pretty good,
though, huh?

32:16.767 --> 32:18.336
Yeah.

32:25.108 --> 32:26.242
She blew me.

32:26.276 --> 32:27.711
She what?

32:29.579 --> 32:31.115
Oh.

32:33.150 --> 32:35.353
Yeah, you know,
I, I didn't even ask her for it.

32:35.385 --> 32:36.553
She just did it.

32:39.256 --> 32:42.226
You ever hear of anything like
that ever happening?

32:43.693 --> 32:45.096
Nope.

32:45.128 --> 32:46.330
Huh.

32:48.031 --> 32:50.533
I think it's
'cause her parents are divorced.

32:50.567 --> 32:52.502
Did she tell you that?

32:52.536 --> 32:54.372
No.

32:54.404 --> 32:57.173
I'm just guessing.

32:57.207 --> 33:00.177
She just did it.

33:00.210 --> 33:01.644
We parked
near the cemetery...

33:01.678 --> 33:04.215
Okay. Okay. Well,
I'm very happy for you,

33:04.248 --> 33:05.615
but if you don't mind,

33:05.648 --> 33:07.183
I got some work
to do here.

33:07.217 --> 33:08.686
Oh, yeah, sure. Sure.

33:08.719 --> 33:10.388
Just thank you
for the car.

33:10.421 --> 33:12.088
It wouldn't have happened
without the car.

33:12.122 --> 33:14.057
Yeah.
Y... You're welcome.

33:18.162 --> 33:21.365
She must have done it before,
don't you think?

33:22.633 --> 33:24.035
Could be.

33:24.067 --> 33:25.301
Huh.

33:25.335 --> 33:27.771
I really don't know
what to make of it.

33:27.805 --> 33:30.108
That's clear.

33:34.077 --> 33:35.480
You think I should
see her again?

33:37.114 --> 33:38.482
Up to you.

33:51.728 --> 33:54.365
<i>So, we understand
you met the Cottler boy.</i>

33:54.397 --> 33:56.232
Esther,
what's his name?!

33:56.266 --> 33:57.634
<i>Esther:
Sonny.</i>

33:57.667 --> 34:00.070
Son... Donald Cottler.

34:00.104 --> 34:01.439
Donald Cottler,
but they call him Sonny.

34:01.471 --> 34:03.173
<i>His aunt lives
here in Newark.</i>

34:03.207 --> 34:04.708
<i>When we said
where you were,</i>

34:04.740 --> 34:06.576
<i>she told us
that her maiden name was Cottler</i>

34:06.609 --> 34:09.612
<i>and her brother's family
lives in Cleveland</i>

34:09.646 --> 34:12.349
<i>and her nephew goes
to the same college</i>

34:12.382 --> 34:14.684
<i>and is president
of the Jewish Fraternity</i>

34:14.717 --> 34:16.853
<i>and captain
of the basketball team</i>

34:16.887 --> 34:18.489
<i>and something else.
What else?</i>

34:18.521 --> 34:20.690
President of the Greeks,
the Greek System Council.

34:20.724 --> 34:21.859
Right, right, right.

34:21.891 --> 34:23.326
President
of the Council.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.695
Imagine that, a Jew
president of the Greeks.

34:25.728 --> 34:28.130
Oh, yeah, Sonny.

34:28.164 --> 34:29.532
Right. Yeah, he came around.

34:29.565 --> 34:31.367
Oh. So what
did he tell you?

34:31.400 --> 34:33.471
He made a pitch
for his fraternity.

34:33.503 --> 34:34.672
<i>And?</i>

34:34.704 --> 34:36.539
I said I wasn't interested.

34:36.572 --> 34:39.676
But his aunt says
he's a wonderful boy,

34:39.710 --> 34:41.311
all "A"s, like you,

34:41.344 --> 34:43.679
and a very handsome boy,
I understand.

34:43.713 --> 34:46.317
Extremely handsome,
a dreamboat.

34:46.349 --> 34:47.784
What's that
supposed to mean?

34:47.818 --> 34:50.788
<i>Dad, please stop sending
people to visit me.</i>

34:50.820 --> 34:52.755
But you're there
all by yourself.

34:52.789 --> 34:54.725
Dad, I can't take
any more of this.

34:54.757 --> 34:56.659
<i>But how do I know
what's going on with you?</i>

34:56.693 --> 34:58.262
<i>You could be
doing anything.</i>

34:58.295 --> 35:01.365
I do one thing.
I go to classes, and I study,

35:01.398 --> 35:03.733
and I make 18 bucks
a week at the library.

35:03.766 --> 35:06.169
And what's wrong
with making some friends?

35:06.202 --> 35:08.304
<i>Some Jewish
friends?</i>

35:08.338 --> 35:09.573
I...

35:09.606 --> 35:10.841
I gotta go.

35:10.873 --> 35:11.841
<i>Marcus!</i>

35:11.875 --> 35:13.443
I... Look,
I'm hanging up.

35:13.476 --> 35:14.478
<i>Marcus!</i>

35:56.987 --> 35:58.322
<i>Wo
Hello, Marc.</i>

35:58.355 --> 35:59.423
Oh.

35:59.456 --> 36:01.358
Olivia. Hi.

36:03.527 --> 36:05.829
I did that because
I liked you so much.

36:07.965 --> 36:09.333
Pardon?

36:09.365 --> 36:11.835
I said I did that
because I liked you.

36:13.269 --> 36:15.405
I know you
can't figure it out.

36:15.438 --> 36:16.973
I know it's why
I haven't heard from you

36:17.007 --> 36:18.642
and why you
ignored me in class,

36:18.675 --> 36:21.211
so I'm figuring it out
for you.

36:21.244 --> 36:22.612
- Any other mysteries?
- No.

36:22.646 --> 36:24.414
No, that's okay.

36:24.447 --> 36:27.417
No. It's not okay.

36:27.451 --> 36:30.253
It's not okay with you.

36:30.286 --> 36:33.856
You know, I liked
your seriousness.

36:33.889 --> 36:35.792
I liked your maturity
at dinner,

36:35.826 --> 36:37.894
or what I took
to be maturity.

36:37.927 --> 36:40.630
I made a joke about it,
but I liked your intensity.

36:40.664 --> 36:44.635
I never met anyone
so intense before.

36:44.668 --> 36:47.905
I liked your looks,
Marcus. I still do.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.976
It's just that I've...

36:52.009 --> 36:53.777
never...

36:57.313 --> 36:59.649
You ever do that
with somebody else?

37:01.485 --> 37:02.519
I did.

37:04.554 --> 37:06.657
So, no one's ever
done it with you?

37:07.958 --> 37:09.526
Not even close.

37:09.559 --> 37:12.396
So now you think
I'm a slut.

37:12.429 --> 37:14.764
I... no.
Absolutely not.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.899
You're lying. It's why
you won't speak to me,

37:16.932 --> 37:18.268
because I'm a slut.

37:18.302 --> 37:21.005
But you did
do it before...

37:21.038 --> 37:23.306
- This was the second time.
- but that doesn't make you a slut.

37:23.340 --> 37:25.309
I was at Mount Holyoke.

37:25.342 --> 37:27.610
I was at a party at Amherst.
I was drunk.

37:27.643 --> 37:29.612
The whole thing was awful.
I didn't know anything.

37:29.646 --> 37:31.715
I was drinking
all the time.

37:31.748 --> 37:34.717
It's why I transferred.
They suspended me.

37:34.751 --> 37:37.288
I spent three months
at a clinic drying out.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.922
I don't drink anymore.

37:38.954 --> 37:41.824
I don't drink anything alcoholic,
and I won't ever again.

37:41.858 --> 37:44.662
This time with you,
I wasn't drunk.

37:44.695 --> 37:46.563
I wasn't drunk,
and I wasn't crazy.

37:46.596 --> 37:48.831
I wanted to do it to you
not because I'm a slut,

37:48.864 --> 37:50.767
but because I wanted
to do it to you.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.304
Can't you understand that
I wanted to give you that?

37:56.106 --> 37:57.675
I think so.

37:57.708 --> 37:59.309
I'm trying, really.

38:00.744 --> 38:02.579
But you can't.

38:04.614 --> 38:06.483
God, what is
wrong with you?

38:20.463 --> 38:22.965
<i>Dear Olivia,</i>

38:22.998 --> 38:24.901
<i>you think I've spurned you</i>

38:24.934 --> 38:27.904
<i>because of what happened
in the car the other night.</i>

38:27.938 --> 38:30.907
<i>As I explained, it's because
nothing approaching that</i>

38:30.940 --> 38:33.910
<i>has ever
happened to me before,</i>

38:33.943 --> 38:36.779
<i>just as no girl has
ever said to me anything</i>

38:36.813 --> 38:39.916
<i>resembling what you said to me
in the library tonight.</i>

38:39.949 --> 38:43.119
<i>You are different
from anyone I've known,</i>

38:43.152 --> 38:46.823
<i>and the last thing you
could ever be called is a slut.</i>

38:46.856 --> 38:50.594
<i>You're mature.
You're beautiful.</i>

38:50.626 --> 38:53.931
<i>You are vastly
more experienced than I am.</i>

38:53.963 --> 38:55.998
<i>That's what threw me.</i>

38:56.032 --> 38:58.469
<i>Forgive me.</i>

38:58.501 --> 39:00.871
<i>Say hello to me in class.</i>

39:08.043 --> 39:09.045
Fucker.

39:09.079 --> 39:10.881
Oh, I'm not the slut.

39:28.898 --> 39:32.737
May I please speak
to Miss Olivia Hutton?

39:34.538 --> 39:35.672
Who?

39:35.704 --> 39:37.741
Oh. Marcus Messner.

39:39.074 --> 39:41.077
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'll wait.

39:42.878 --> 39:44.748
<i>Wo
Sorry. She's not here.</i>

39:44.780 --> 39:46.150
Can I leave a message?

39:48.818 --> 39:50.186
Well, yeah,

39:50.219 --> 39:52.455
another message.

40:12.108 --> 40:13.977
<i>Dear Marcus,</i>

40:14.010 --> 40:15.579
<i>I can't see you.</i>

40:15.612 --> 40:18.182
<i>You'll only run away
from me again,</i>

40:18.215 --> 40:20.517
<i>this time when you see
the scar</i>

40:20.550 --> 40:22.986
<i>across the width
of my wrist.</i>

40:23.018 --> 40:24.954
<i>Had you seen it
the night of our date,</i>

40:24.987 --> 40:27.523
<i>I would have
honestly explained it to you.</i>

40:27.556 --> 40:30.126
<i>I was prepared to do that.</i>

40:30.159 --> 40:31.928
<i>I didn't try to cover it up,</i>

40:31.961 --> 40:34.097
<i>but as it happened,
you failed to notice it.</i>

40:35.898 --> 40:37.768
<i>It's a scar from a razor.</i>

40:37.800 --> 40:40.703
<i>I tried to kill myself.</i>

40:40.737 --> 40:44.141
<i>That's why I went
for three months to the clinic.</i>

40:44.173 --> 40:48.077
<i>It was the Menninger Clinic
in Topeka, Kansas...</i>

40:48.110 --> 40:51.080
<i>the Menninger Sanitarium
and Psychopathic Hospital.</i>

40:51.114 --> 40:54.083
<i>There's the full name
for you.</i>

40:54.117 --> 40:58.522
<i>My father the doctor
knows people there.</i>

40:58.554 --> 41:01.257
<i>I used the razor
when I was drunk.</i>

41:01.291 --> 41:04.260
<i>If I had been sober,
I would have succeeded.</i>

41:04.293 --> 41:06.730
<i>So three cheers
for 10 rye and gingers.</i>

41:06.762 --> 41:08.865
<i>They're why I'm alive today.</i>

41:11.300 --> 41:14.170
<i>That and my incapacity
to carry anything out.</i>

41:15.271 --> 41:17.842
<i>Even suicide is beyond me.</i>

41:20.844 --> 41:23.146
<i>I don't regret
doing what we did,</i>

41:23.179 --> 41:25.648
<i>but we mustn't
do anything more.</i>

41:26.916 --> 41:28.284
<i>Forget about me, Marcus.</i>

41:28.318 --> 41:30.653
<i>There's no one
around here like you.</i>

41:30.686 --> 41:32.522
<i>You're not a simple soul</i>

41:32.556 --> 41:34.625
<i>and have no business
being here.</i>

41:34.657 --> 41:37.728
<i>If you survive
the squareness of this place,</i>

41:37.760 --> 41:39.896
<i>you'll have a sterling future.</i>

41:39.929 --> 41:43.900
<i>Why did you come to Winesburg
to begin with?</i>

41:43.934 --> 41:46.169
<i>I came because it's so square.</i>

41:46.202 --> 41:49.039
<i>That's supposed to make me
a normal girl.</i>

41:49.072 --> 41:51.041
<i>But you...</i>

41:51.074 --> 41:53.644
<i>you should be studying
philosophy at the Sorbonne</i>

41:53.677 --> 41:56.179
<i>and living in a garret
in Montparnasse.</i>

41:56.211 --> 41:58.981
<i>We both should.</i>

41:59.014 --> 42:01.984
<i>Farewell, beauticious man.</i>

42:02.018 --> 42:03.554
<i>Olivia.</i>

42:27.277 --> 42:29.278
<i>Olivia!</i>

42:29.311 --> 42:33.083
<i>You forgot
your allowance.</i>

42:33.115 --> 42:34.818
We'll see you
at Thanksgiving.

42:34.851 --> 42:36.686
Your mother
will join us.

43:02.778 --> 43:05.114
Ah. What employment
have we here?

43:05.148 --> 43:07.818
Please, no Shakespeare
rehearsal tonight.

43:13.155 --> 43:14.157
Hey!

43:14.190 --> 43:15.726
By my life,

43:15.759 --> 43:17.394
this is my lady's hand.

43:17.427 --> 43:20.364
These be her very "C"s,
her "U"s, and her "T"s.

43:20.396 --> 43:22.732
Thus makes she her...

43:24.400 --> 43:27.169
To the unknown beloved,
this, and my good wishes:

43:27.202 --> 43:28.338
her very phrases!

43:28.371 --> 43:30.039
By your leave, wax.

43:30.072 --> 43:31.974
Soft! and the impressure
her very Lucrece,

43:32.007 --> 43:34.210
with which she uses
to seal: 'tis my lady.

43:34.244 --> 43:35.746
<i>To whom should this be?</i>

43:35.778 --> 43:37.748
<i>Jove knows I love:
But who?</i>

43:37.780 --> 43:40.317
Lips, do not move;
No man must know.

43:40.349 --> 43:41.817
God damn it, Flusser!

43:41.851 --> 43:43.320
No man must know.

43:43.353 --> 43:45.155
What follows?
The numbers altered.

43:45.188 --> 43:46.289
No man must know:

43:46.322 --> 43:48.826
unless this should
be thee, Malvolio?

43:50.126 --> 43:51.394
What the...

43:51.427 --> 43:52.996
what the hell
is wrong with you?!

43:53.028 --> 43:54.398
Hey, stop getting
all worked up.

43:54.431 --> 43:56.032
How about a little bit
of respect, huh?

43:56.065 --> 43:57.800
What?

43:57.833 --> 44:00.302
What? That's from
the one that blew you?

44:00.335 --> 44:01.904
In my car?

44:01.938 --> 44:04.173
How about
respecting my car

44:04.206 --> 44:06.710
by not driving around
with some slut in it.

44:30.467 --> 44:32.035
You are in luck.

44:32.068 --> 44:34.004
There is a vacancy
in Neil Hall.

44:34.036 --> 44:36.706
Mrs. Burgess in Housing
can get you the key.

44:36.739 --> 44:39.008
It's rather rustic.

44:39.041 --> 44:42.813
Oh, and you will need to schedule
a chat with Dean Caudwell.

44:42.846 --> 44:45.347
He likes to be informed
of these kinds of changes.

44:45.380 --> 44:49.251
Can you come by Monday,
say, 2:30?

44:49.284 --> 44:50.319
Sure.

45:07.170 --> 45:12.142
Volunteers are still needed
for homecoming weekend.

45:12.175 --> 45:15.077
As you know,
last year's defeat

45:15.110 --> 45:18.013
<i>at the hands
of College of Wooster</i>

45:18.047 --> 45:20.817
<i>broke a winning streak
that will require,</i>

45:20.849 --> 45:23.819
<i>I shall say,
all hands on deck,</i>

45:23.853 --> 45:26.523
<i>which we will redress,
hence the need.</i>

45:26.556 --> 45:29.259
<i>I speak on behalf
of Coach Blauvelt</i>

45:29.291 --> 45:31.494
<i>when I say the Bulldog bite</i>

45:31.527 --> 45:36.265
<i>can only be commensurate
with a Bulldog bark.</i>

45:36.298 --> 45:38.434
<i>We are, all of us,</i>

45:38.467 --> 45:41.070
<i>responsible
to the Bulldog bark.</i>

46:09.164 --> 46:10.367
Olivia.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.535
Olivia, please.

46:11.568 --> 46:13.170
Yes, Marcus?

46:15.003 --> 46:17.239
If...

46:17.273 --> 46:19.976
if you could just...

46:20.009 --> 46:22.978
sit next to me
again in class,

46:23.012 --> 46:25.916
it would really
help me concentrate.

46:25.949 --> 46:28.385
It's harder when
you're behind me.

46:28.418 --> 46:30.019
I keep wanting
to turn around.

46:32.621 --> 46:34.457
Okay, maybe.

46:36.592 --> 46:39.461
All right.
Thank you.

46:39.494 --> 46:41.565
I heard you moved rooms.

46:44.032 --> 46:46.068
Yeah. I...

46:46.101 --> 46:50.840
I had a disagreement
with my roommates.

46:50.873 --> 46:52.275
I moved
to Neil Hall.

46:54.409 --> 46:56.879
You weren't
in Chapel yesterday.

46:56.913 --> 46:59.282
Honestly,
I just needed a break.

46:59.315 --> 47:01.851
I don't know how much more
of Dr. Donehower's

47:01.885 --> 47:04.855
going on about
"Christ's example" I can take.

47:04.887 --> 47:06.922
Maybe you could get
some kind of waiver

47:06.956 --> 47:09.059
for conscientious
objection.

47:09.092 --> 47:10.427
Why's that?
Because I'm Jewish?

47:10.460 --> 47:11.561
I don't object
because I'm Jewish.

47:11.594 --> 47:12.896
I object because
I'm an atheist.

47:12.929 --> 47:14.431
I know.

47:19.034 --> 47:20.569
Thank you
for talking to me.

47:20.603 --> 47:22.405
If I talk to you again,

47:22.438 --> 47:25.175
maybe you won't have to
stand under my window all the time.

47:27.577 --> 47:30.046
Oh.

47:30.079 --> 47:32.015
Um...

47:32.047 --> 47:33.449
I, uh...

47:34.617 --> 47:36.186
You know, it's funny.

47:36.219 --> 47:39.489
I don't actually know
which window is yours.

47:39.521 --> 47:42.291
I'm on the third floor,
on the left,

47:42.324 --> 47:45.027
facing the quad,
just for the record.

47:45.061 --> 47:47.297
I rarely see you
looking up.

47:47.329 --> 47:50.067
If you're not a Peeping Tom,
what's the point?

47:51.199 --> 47:53.603
Guess it just
makes me feel as if...

47:56.472 --> 48:01.044
like I'm making sure
you're okay.

48:01.077 --> 48:03.480
Oh, Marcus, I'm fine.

48:05.014 --> 48:07.384
It's you
I'm worried about.

48:10.652 --> 48:12.321
You can come in now.

48:20.496 --> 48:21.999
Come on in.

48:32.641 --> 48:34.644
Marcus Messner.

48:37.146 --> 48:39.449
I wanted you to come in
so we could meet

48:39.481 --> 48:41.617
and find out if I could
be of any help to you

48:41.650 --> 48:43.585
in adjusting
to Winesburg.

48:43.619 --> 48:45.221
I see by your transcript

48:45.253 --> 48:48.223
that you're a remarkably
gifted student.

48:48.257 --> 48:51.494
First in your family
ever to attend college.

48:51.527 --> 48:55.030
Captain of your baseball team
at high school.

48:55.063 --> 48:57.232
Scholarship
from your temple.

48:57.266 --> 48:59.536
I wouldn't want
anything at Winesburg

48:59.568 --> 49:01.271
to interfere
in the slightest

49:01.304 --> 49:03.373
with such a stellar record
of achievement.

49:03.405 --> 49:05.007
Neither do I, sir.

49:09.478 --> 49:14.016
Do you see any potential difficulties
on the horizon here?

49:14.050 --> 49:16.119
No, sir.
I don't, sir.

49:16.152 --> 49:18.121
How are things going
with your class work?

49:18.153 --> 49:20.389
You're getting all you hoped for
from your courses?

49:20.422 --> 49:22.257
Yes. Yes, sir.

49:22.291 --> 49:23.727
You're socializing
enough?

49:23.760 --> 49:26.296
Yes.

49:26.329 --> 49:29.065
Yes, I am, sir.

49:35.338 --> 49:36.740
Thank you, sir.

49:39.442 --> 49:41.411
The only problem
is that you seem to have

49:41.443 --> 49:44.413
some trouble settling
into dormitory life.

49:44.447 --> 49:46.548
Tell me,
in your own words,

49:46.581 --> 49:48.217
what seems to be
the trouble?

49:50.385 --> 49:52.554
I'm sorry, could you
repeat your question, sir?

49:52.588 --> 49:54.157
Calm down, son.

49:54.190 --> 49:55.592
Try a little more water.

49:58.594 --> 50:02.432
And no need to call me sir,
by the way.

50:02.465 --> 50:03.667
So...

50:05.300 --> 50:07.536
what was the problem
with your accommodations?

50:07.570 --> 50:10.539
In the room to which
I was assigned,

50:10.572 --> 50:13.542
one of my...
roommates

50:13.576 --> 50:16.311
would always play the phonograph
after I went to bed,

50:16.344 --> 50:18.748
and I was not able to get
a good night's sleep.

50:20.215 --> 50:22.317
I need my sleep
in order to do my work.

50:22.351 --> 50:25.121
The situation was...

50:25.153 --> 50:26.623
insupportable.

50:26.655 --> 50:28.590
But couldn't you sit down
and work out a time

50:28.623 --> 50:30.192
for his playing
the phonograph

50:30.226 --> 50:32.429
that was agreeable
to the two of you?

50:32.461 --> 50:35.431
You had to move out?
There was no other choice?

50:35.465 --> 50:37.700
I had to move out.

50:37.733 --> 50:40.070
No way of reaching
a compromise?

50:40.103 --> 50:43.072
Did you seek the support
of your other roommate?

50:43.106 --> 50:45.642
There was no compromise
with him, sir,

50:45.675 --> 50:47.677
and my other roommate
was not sympathetic.

50:47.710 --> 50:50.646
Are you often unable
to reach a compromise

50:50.679 --> 50:52.614
with people whom you
don't see eye to eye with?

50:52.648 --> 50:54.416
I wouldn't say often, sir.

50:54.449 --> 50:56.318
I wouldn't say anything like this
has happened before.

50:56.351 --> 50:57.619
Really, Marcus,

50:57.652 --> 50:59.755
you don't have to do that,
calling me "sir".

50:59.789 --> 51:01.357
Call me Dean Caudwell,

51:01.389 --> 51:03.092
or call me Dean,
if you like.

51:03.126 --> 51:05.461
Winesburg isn't
a military academy.

51:05.494 --> 51:08.498
I don't mind
calling you sir, Dean.

51:08.530 --> 51:12.268
It says here that your father
is a kosher butcher.

51:12.300 --> 51:14.670
No. No, it does not.

51:14.704 --> 51:17.673
I remember
just writing down just "butcher."

51:17.706 --> 51:19.775
That's what
I would write down on any form.

51:19.809 --> 51:21.878
Well, that's what
you did write.

51:21.911 --> 51:25.648
I'm merely assuming
that he's a kosher butcher.

51:25.681 --> 51:28.518
He is, but that is
not what I wrote down.

51:28.550 --> 51:30.686
I acknowledged that.

51:30.719 --> 51:33.388
But it's not inaccurate,
is it,

51:33.422 --> 51:37.159
to identify him more precisely
as a kosher butcher?

51:37.193 --> 51:40.130
Neither is what I wrote down
inaccurate, sir.

51:40.163 --> 51:43.666
I'd be curious to know why you
didn't write down "kosher," Marcus.

51:45.268 --> 51:47.871
Sir, if you are
asking me if I was trying to hide

51:47.903 --> 51:49.606
the religion into
which I was born,

51:49.639 --> 51:51.208
the answer is no.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.409
Well, I certainly
hope that's so.

51:54.443 --> 51:56.846
I'm glad to hear that.

51:56.878 --> 52:00.849
Everyone has a right
to openly practice his own faith,

52:00.882 --> 52:02.818
and that holds true
at Winesburg

52:02.851 --> 52:05.754
just as it does
everywhere else in this country.

52:05.788 --> 52:09.458
On the other hand, under
"religious preference,"

52:09.492 --> 52:11.327
I see you
didn't write "Jewish,"

52:11.360 --> 52:13.596
though you are
of Jewish extraction.

52:13.628 --> 52:15.464
And, in accordance
with the college's attempt

52:15.498 --> 52:18.601
to assist students in residing
with others of the same faith,

52:18.634 --> 52:22.204
you were assigned
Jewish roommates.

52:22.237 --> 52:25.207
I didn't write anything
under religious preference, sir.

52:25.240 --> 52:26.775
I can see that.

52:26.809 --> 52:28.511
I'm wondering why that is.

52:28.543 --> 52:31.513
It's because
I have none.

52:31.547 --> 52:35.518
I don't prefer to practice
one religion over another.

52:35.550 --> 52:39.454
What then, provides you
with spiritual sustenance?

52:39.487 --> 52:42.457
To whom do you pray
when you need solace?

52:42.490 --> 52:44.427
I don't need
solace, sir.

52:44.460 --> 52:47.329
I don't believe in God.

52:47.362 --> 52:49.298
I don't believe
in prayer.

52:49.331 --> 52:51.233
I am sustained
by what is real.

52:51.266 --> 52:53.869
Praying, to me,
is preposterous.

52:53.902 --> 52:55.471
Is it, now?

52:55.503 --> 52:57.507
And yet
so many millions do it.

52:57.539 --> 53:00.643
Millions once thought
the Earth was flat, sir.

53:01.911 --> 53:04.246
Yes, that's true.
But may I ask you, Marcus,

53:04.280 --> 53:05.615
merely out of curiosity,

53:05.648 --> 53:08.617
how do you
get by in life,

53:08.650 --> 53:12.621
filled as life is inevitably
with trials and tribulations,

53:12.655 --> 53:14.490
lacking
spiritual guidance?

53:14.523 --> 53:15.892
I get
straight "A"s, sir.

53:15.925 --> 53:19.229
I didn't ask
about your grades.

53:19.262 --> 53:21.364
I know your grades.

53:21.396 --> 53:22.965
You have every right
to be proud of them,

53:22.998 --> 53:24.399
as I've already told you.

53:24.432 --> 53:25.701
Well, then you
know the answer

53:25.735 --> 53:28.238
to your question
of how I get by, just fine.

53:28.271 --> 53:30.242
Well, if I may say so,
it doesn't look

53:30.243 --> 53:32.243
to me like you get along just fine.

53:32.275 --> 53:34.644
Seems to me as soon as there's
a difference of opinion,

53:34.677 --> 53:36.512
you pick up and leave.

53:36.545 --> 53:39.581
Is there a problem with finding
a solution in quietly leaving?

53:39.614 --> 53:41.283
But look where
you've wound up.

53:41.317 --> 53:45.255
In the least desirable room
on the entire campus.

53:45.288 --> 53:47.456
Frankly, I don't
like the idea of you up there alone.

53:47.489 --> 53:48.757
But I did
not end up there

53:48.791 --> 53:51.594
because of lack
of religious beliefs, sir,

53:51.626 --> 53:55.398
if that's what you are suggesting
in a roundabout way.

53:55.431 --> 53:56.833
Why is it, then?

53:58.467 --> 54:00.403
As I explained
to you before,

54:00.436 --> 54:01.804
the living arrangements
I was given

54:01.836 --> 54:03.306
were intolerable.

54:03.338 --> 54:05.275
Tolerance appears
to be something

54:05.307 --> 54:06.909
of a problem for you,
young man.

54:06.942 --> 54:09.679
I've never heard that
said about me before, sir.

54:09.711 --> 54:11.280
There appear
to be several things

54:11.313 --> 54:13.048
you've never heard
about yourself before.

54:13.081 --> 54:15.585
But before,
you were living at home

54:15.617 --> 54:18.587
in the bosom
of your childhood family.

54:18.621 --> 54:22.291
Now you are living
at Winesburg as an adult,

54:22.324 --> 54:24.760
and aside from mastering
your studies,

54:24.793 --> 54:27.596
your task is to learn
how to get along with people

54:27.630 --> 54:30.300
and to extend tolerance
to those

54:30.333 --> 54:32.535
who may not be
carbon copies of yourself.

54:32.568 --> 54:33.936
Tolerance.

54:33.969 --> 54:37.639
How about extending
some tolerance to me, sir?

54:37.672 --> 54:41.076
Look, I, I don't
mean to be brash or insolent,

54:41.110 --> 54:44.681
but what exactly is the crime
I have committed?

54:44.713 --> 54:46.516
Here? Today?

54:46.548 --> 54:48.016
So I've
switched rooms.

54:48.050 --> 54:50.687
Is that considered a crime
here at Winesburg?

54:50.719 --> 54:53.088
Has anyone
said it is a crime?

54:53.121 --> 54:56.925
You display a fondness
for dramatic exaggeration.

54:56.958 --> 54:58.994
It doesn't serve you well

54:59.027 --> 55:01.997
and is a characteristic
you might want to reflect upon.

55:02.030 --> 55:05.367
Now tell me, how do you
get along with your family?

55:05.400 --> 55:08.904
I see from the form here
you also have no siblings,

55:08.938 --> 55:11.340
so it's just you and
your parents at home,

55:11.373 --> 55:13.742
if I'm to take what you've
written here to be accurate.

55:13.775 --> 55:16.346
Why wouldn't it
be accurate?

55:16.378 --> 55:18.847
I was accurate when
I wrote down my father is a butcher.

55:18.880 --> 55:20.549
He is a butcher.

55:20.583 --> 55:23.052
It isn't I alone
who would describe him as a butcher.

55:23.085 --> 55:25.954
He would describe
himself as a butcher.

55:25.987 --> 55:28.623
You described him
as a kosher butcher,

55:28.657 --> 55:30.992
which is fine, but that is
not grounds for intimating

55:31.025 --> 55:33.495
that I've been in any way inaccurate
in filling out my application...

55:33.528 --> 55:34.864
If I may interrupt,
Marcus,

55:34.896 --> 55:37.866
how do you three get along,
from your perspective?

55:37.900 --> 55:39.635
That's the question
I asked.

55:39.668 --> 55:41.037
You, your mother
and your father,

55:41.070 --> 55:42.638
how do you get along?

55:42.670 --> 55:44.440
A straight answer,
please.

55:50.079 --> 55:52.081
My mother and I get along
perfectly well.

55:52.114 --> 55:54.083
We always have.

55:54.115 --> 55:56.853
So have my father and I
for most of my life.

56:00.822 --> 56:02.991
From my last year
at grade school

56:03.025 --> 56:06.528
until I moved
to Winesburg,

56:06.561 --> 56:09.431
I worked part time
for him at the shop.

56:09.465 --> 56:13.570
We were as close
as father and son could be.

56:15.737 --> 56:18.573
Of late, there's been
some strain between us.

56:18.606 --> 56:21.076
Strain over what,
may I ask?

56:21.110 --> 56:22.678
He's been...

56:22.710 --> 56:26.114
unnecessarily worried
about my independence.

56:26.148 --> 56:30.119
I think it has to do
with many of my cousins

56:30.152 --> 56:32.021
having died
in the last war.

56:32.054 --> 56:34.757
You say unnecessarily
worried about you,

56:34.789 --> 56:36.558
because he has
no reason to be?

56:36.592 --> 56:38.126
None at all.

56:38.159 --> 56:39.728
Is he worried,
for instance,

56:39.762 --> 56:41.831
about your inability
to adjust

56:41.864 --> 56:44.500
to your roommates
here at Winesburg?

56:44.532 --> 56:47.502
I have not told him
about my roommates.

56:47.536 --> 56:49.505
I did not think
it was important.

56:49.538 --> 56:52.007
Nor is
"inability to adjust"

56:52.041 --> 56:55.010
a proper way to describe
the difficulty, sir.

56:55.043 --> 56:57.446
I do not want
to be distracted

56:57.480 --> 57:00.016
from my studies
by superfluous problems.

57:00.048 --> 57:02.451
I wouldn't consider your having
to move out of your room

57:02.485 --> 57:03.952
a superfluous problem,

57:03.985 --> 57:06.121
and neither would
your father, I'm sure,

57:06.155 --> 57:08.224
if he were apprised
of the situation,

57:08.257 --> 57:11.159
as he has every right
to be, by the way.

57:11.193 --> 57:14.030
But be that as it may,

57:14.063 --> 57:17.967
have you gone on any dates
since you've been to Winesburg?

57:18.000 --> 57:19.668
Dates?

57:19.702 --> 57:21.504
Dates.

57:22.704 --> 57:24.473
Yes.

57:24.507 --> 57:25.675
Yes, I have.

57:25.708 --> 57:26.843
A few?

57:26.876 --> 57:29.144
Some? Many?

57:29.177 --> 57:31.114
One.

57:32.213 --> 57:34.183
Just one?

57:35.818 --> 57:38.187
Sir, I object to being
interrogated like this!

57:38.219 --> 57:40.155
I do not see
the purpose of it.

57:40.188 --> 57:41.857
These are my own
private affairs,

57:41.891 --> 57:43.526
as is my religious life,

57:43.559 --> 57:45.894
my social life,
and how I conduct it.

57:45.927 --> 57:47.762
I have broken no laws,

57:47.795 --> 57:49.931
I have caused no one
injury or harm,

57:49.965 --> 57:51.767
and in no way
have my actions

57:51.800 --> 57:54.135
impinged
on anyone's rights.

57:54.168 --> 57:57.138
<i>If anyone's rights
have been impinged on, they are mine.</i>

57:57.172 --> 57:59.509
Sit down, please,
and explain yourself.

57:59.541 --> 58:03.144
I also object to having to attend
Chapel 40 times

58:03.177 --> 58:05.047
before I graduate
in order to earn a degree.

58:05.079 --> 58:07.516
I do not see where the college
has the right

58:07.550 --> 58:09.818
to force me to listen
to a clergyman,

58:09.851 --> 58:12.788
of whatever faith,
even once.

58:12.820 --> 58:14.757
Or listen
to a Christian hymn

58:14.789 --> 58:16.726
invoking
the Christian deity,

58:16.759 --> 58:19.295
given that I am
an atheist who is, to be truthful,

58:19.327 --> 58:23.099
<i>deeply offended by the practices
of organized religion.</i>

58:23.132 --> 58:26.302
I am altogether capable of leading
a moral existence

58:26.335 --> 58:28.103
without
crediting beliefs

58:28.137 --> 58:31.007
that are impossible
to substantiate and beyond credulity.

58:31.039 --> 58:34.876
I take it you are
familiar, Dean Caudwell,

58:34.909 --> 58:37.547
with the writings
of Bertrand Russell.

58:37.579 --> 58:39.614
Bertrand Russell,

58:39.648 --> 58:42.285
<i>the distinguished
mathematician and philosopher</i>

58:42.318 --> 58:43.719
<i>who was last year's
recipient</i>

58:43.751 --> 58:45.755
<i>of the Nobel Prize
in Literature.</i>

58:45.788 --> 58:48.958
The work of literature in which
he was awarded the Nobel Prize

58:48.990 --> 58:51.960
is his widely read essay,
"Why I Am Not a Christian."

58:51.994 --> 58:54.130
Are you familiar
with this essay, sir?

58:54.163 --> 58:55.798
Marcus, please sit down.

58:55.831 --> 58:57.700
<i>Sir, I was asking you
if you are familiar</i>

58:57.733 --> 58:59.635
<i>with this very important essay
by Bertrand Russell,</i>

58:59.668 --> 59:01.570
and I take it
the answer is no.

59:01.603 --> 59:04.573
Well, I am very familiar
with this essay,

59:04.606 --> 59:07.242
because I set myself
the task of memorizing

59:07.275 --> 59:09.277
large sections of it

59:09.311 --> 59:12.280
when I was captain
of my high school debating team.

59:12.313 --> 59:15.317
Now, if you were
to read this essay...

59:15.351 --> 59:18.287
and in the interest
of open-mindedness,

59:18.320 --> 59:20.823
I would urge you
to do so...

59:20.856 --> 59:23.125
you would see
that Bertrand Russell

59:23.157 --> 59:26.127
undoes with logic
that is beyond dispute

59:26.161 --> 59:27.963
the first-cause
argument,

59:27.996 --> 59:29.297
the natural-law
argument,

59:29.331 --> 59:31.000
the argument
from design,

59:31.032 --> 59:32.801
the moral arguments
for a deity,

59:32.835 --> 59:35.804
and the argument
for the remedying of injustice.

59:35.838 --> 59:38.807
Having studied
these arguments,

59:38.840 --> 59:41.242
I intend to live my life
in accordance with them,

59:41.275 --> 59:43.778
as I am sure you would
have to admit, sir,

59:43.811 --> 59:45.213
I have
every right to do.

59:45.246 --> 59:46.949
Please sit down.

59:52.920 --> 59:54.590
I'm sorry.

01:00:03.065 --> 01:00:06.034
I see here that you are
studying to be a lawyer.

01:00:06.068 --> 01:00:08.738
On the basis
of this interview,

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:12.642
I think you are destined
to be an outstanding lawyer.

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:15.277
I can see you
one day arguing a case

01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:18.847
before the Supreme Court
and winning it.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.917
I admire your directness,
your diction,

01:00:22.951 --> 01:00:25.887
your sentence structure,

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.890
even if I don't necessarily
choose to admire

01:00:28.923 --> 01:00:31.427
whom or what
you choose to read

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:35.197
and the gullibility
with which you take at face value

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:39.101
rationalist blasphemies
spouted by an immoralist

01:00:39.134 --> 01:00:41.170
of the ilk
of Bertrand Russell,

01:00:41.202 --> 01:00:44.105
four times married,
a blatant adulterer,

01:00:44.139 --> 01:00:47.876
an advocate of free love,
a self-confessed socialist

01:00:47.909 --> 01:00:50.346
dismissed from
his university position

01:00:50.378 --> 01:00:53.214
and imprisoned during
the First War by the British

01:00:53.248 --> 01:00:55.184
for what in plain English
I would call treason.

01:00:55.217 --> 01:00:56.786
What about
the Nobel Prize?!

01:00:56.818 --> 01:00:58.186
I even admire you
now, Marcus,

01:00:58.219 --> 01:01:01.289
when you hammer on my desk
and point to me

01:01:01.322 --> 01:01:03.725
so as to ask
about the Nobel Prize.

01:01:03.759 --> 01:01:05.461
You have
a fighting spirit.

01:01:05.494 --> 01:01:07.329
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't know
that I pointed.

01:01:07.362 --> 01:01:08.864
I didn't mean
to point.

01:01:08.896 --> 01:01:11.099
You did, son.
Not for the first time

01:01:11.132 --> 01:01:13.335
and probably
not for the last.

01:01:13.367 --> 01:01:14.969
But that is
the least of it.

01:01:15.003 --> 01:01:18.974
To find that Bertrand Russell
is a hero of yours

01:01:19.007 --> 01:01:21.342
comes as no great surprise.

01:01:21.376 --> 01:01:23.312
There are
always one or two

01:01:23.344 --> 01:01:26.815
intellectually precocious students
on every campus,

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:30.152
self-appointed members
of an elite intelligentsia

01:01:30.184 --> 01:01:31.953
who need
to elevate themselves

01:01:31.987 --> 01:01:34.356
and feel superior
to their fellow students,

01:01:34.389 --> 01:01:37.358
superior even
to their professors.

01:01:37.391 --> 01:01:42.097
Nonetheless, that is not what we
are here to discuss.

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:44.866
What worries me,
rather,

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.168
is your isolation.

01:01:47.202 --> 01:01:50.272
What worries me is
your outspoken rejection

01:01:50.304 --> 01:01:53.509
of long-standing
Winesburg tradition,

01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:57.512
as witness your response
to Chapel attendance,

01:01:57.545 --> 01:01:59.781
a simple undergraduate
requirement

01:01:59.815 --> 01:02:01.383
which amounts to,
on average,

01:02:01.416 --> 01:02:04.353
little more than a few minutes
per week of your years here.

01:02:04.385 --> 01:02:07.355
In all my experience
at Winesburg,

01:02:07.389 --> 01:02:09.892
I have never
come across a student

01:02:09.925 --> 01:02:11.460
who objected
to that requirement

01:02:11.492 --> 01:02:14.462
as an infringement
on his rights.

01:02:14.496 --> 01:02:18.233
What worries me
is how poorly

01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:22.137
you are fitting in to
the Winesburg community.

01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:26.141
To me, it seems something to be
attended to promptly

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:28.544
and nipped in the bud.

01:02:28.577 --> 01:02:31.313
I, I can't take
any more of this.

01:02:31.346 --> 01:02:33.282
Sir, I think
I'm going to vomit.

01:02:33.315 --> 01:02:34.817
Excuse me?

01:02:34.849 --> 01:02:36.518
I feel ill.

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:39.521
I think
I'm going to vomit.

01:02:39.554 --> 01:02:42.524
I cannot bear being
lectured like this.

01:02:42.557 --> 01:02:44.326
I'm not a malcontent.

01:02:44.358 --> 01:02:46.961
I am not a rebel.

01:02:46.994 --> 01:02:49.964
I have the right
to socialize

01:02:49.998 --> 01:02:52.534
or not socialize
with whomever I see fit.

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:55.538
Furthermore, your argument
against Bertrand Russell

01:02:55.570 --> 01:03:00.543
is not an argument against his ideas
based on reason,

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:03.545
but an argument
against his character,

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:07.349
i.e., an ad hominem attack,

01:03:07.382 --> 01:03:09.818
which is
logically worthless.

01:03:09.851 --> 01:03:11.886
Sir, I respectfully ask
your permission

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.322
to stand up and leave now,

01:03:13.355 --> 01:03:14.456
because
I am afraid if I don't,

01:03:14.489 --> 01:03:16.125
I am going to be sick.

01:03:16.157 --> 01:03:17.960
Of course you may leave.

01:03:17.992 --> 01:03:20.962
I just ask that you
reflect on why leaving

01:03:20.996 --> 01:03:22.364
appears to be
the only way

01:03:22.396 --> 01:03:24.933
you are dealing
with your problems here.

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:28.938
I'm genuinely sorry if you think
I've been wasting your time.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:32.507
Leaving is not how I cope
with my difficulties.

01:03:32.541 --> 01:03:36.144
I strongly object to you
saying that, Dean Caudwell.

01:03:36.177 --> 01:03:39.013
Well, at least
we got over calling me "sir".

01:03:39.047 --> 01:03:41.150
Marcus,
just one last thing.

01:03:41.182 --> 01:03:43.451
I have the impression
from your application

01:03:43.485 --> 01:03:46.021
that you're
a talented baseball player.

01:03:46.054 --> 01:03:49.557
Would you give a thought about
going up for the Winesburg team?

01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:53.261
I played for that team myself
when I was a student here.

01:03:53.295 --> 01:03:54.563
Dean Caudwell,
my high school

01:03:54.596 --> 01:03:56.231
had the worst team
in the league.

01:03:56.264 --> 01:03:58.199
I don't think
I could play at this level.

01:03:58.233 --> 01:04:00.402
The pitching would be a lot faster
than what I'm used to,

01:04:00.434 --> 01:04:02.003
and I don't think...

01:04:02.036 --> 01:04:04.138
choking up on the bat
the way I did at home

01:04:04.172 --> 01:04:05.541
is going to solve
my hitting problems

01:04:05.574 --> 01:04:07.543
at this level
of competition.

01:04:07.576 --> 01:04:10.179
So you're saying you're
not going out for baseball

01:04:10.211 --> 01:04:11.579
because of the competition?

01:04:11.612 --> 01:04:14.115
No, I am saying
that I am realistic

01:04:14.148 --> 01:04:16.451
about my chances
for making the te...

01:04:21.322 --> 01:04:23.058
<i>Alice!</i>

01:04:35.603 --> 01:04:37.906
<i>I was always a light sleeper,</i>

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:39.909
<i>though I could
never remember my dreams</i>

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:42.543
<i>or even whether
I had any dreams.</i>

01:04:42.577 --> 01:04:45.281
<i>But for that day,
and night and day,</i>

01:04:45.313 --> 01:04:47.548
<i>what with the anesthesia,</i>

01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:50.251
<i>I slept a great deal.</i>

01:04:50.284 --> 01:04:52.320
<i>I remember vaguely thinking</i>

01:04:52.353 --> 01:04:55.323
<i>I was married
to Olivia Hutton.</i>

01:04:55.356 --> 01:04:58.059
<i>I remember us
sharing a bedroom,</i>

01:04:58.092 --> 01:05:00.194
<i>of me going off to work,</i>

01:05:00.228 --> 01:05:02.697
<i>of an argument
we had over dinner,</i>

01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:05.701
<i>of a long drive through
a series of small towns,</i>

01:05:05.733 --> 01:05:08.670
<i>and then us
reaching the ocean,</i>

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:11.472
<i>and a cabin by the ocean.</i>

01:05:11.505 --> 01:05:14.042
<i>It's strange, being dead,</i>

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:17.146
<i>as I am now and have been
for I don't know how long,</i>

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:21.150
<i>if "now" can be said
to mean anything any longer,</i>

01:05:21.182 --> 01:05:24.353
<i>that I remember those dreams
as accurately</i>

01:05:24.385 --> 01:05:27.923
<i>as anything I actually
experienced in reality.</i>

01:05:31.059 --> 01:05:32.961
Good morning.

01:05:35.063 --> 01:05:36.432
You're in
the hospital, son.

01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:38.534
<i>You had your appendix
removed.</i>

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:41.235
<i>Just in the nick of time,
the doctors say.</i>

01:05:41.268 --> 01:05:43.371
I had my what?

01:05:43.405 --> 01:05:45.374
<i>Your appendix out.</i>

01:05:45.407 --> 01:05:47.209
Your dean
from the college,

01:05:47.242 --> 01:05:48.711
Mr. Caudwell,
was just now here.

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:51.380
I sent him home,
didn't want to wake you.

01:05:51.413 --> 01:05:52.447
He's called
your parents.

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:54.283
They know
you're fine.

01:05:54.315 --> 01:05:57.218
Your mother will be
here in a few days,

01:05:57.251 --> 01:05:58.753
and you're to call
your father.

01:05:58.786 --> 01:06:00.989
But first...

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:04.026
I need you
to do some business for me into this.

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:17.405
It's no fun being
in the hospital alone.

01:06:17.438 --> 01:06:19.741
Brought these over
to keep you company.

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:21.744
It was worth
the appendicitis.

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:23.579
I doubt it.

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:27.416
Were you in
a lot of pain?

01:06:27.449 --> 01:06:32.153
For about an hour or so
before I blacked out.

01:06:32.186 --> 01:06:34.389
Best part came
in Dean Caudwell's office.

01:06:34.422 --> 01:06:37.625
<i>He called me in to grill me about
changing my dorm.</i>

01:06:37.659 --> 01:06:40.596
<i>I puked all over his trophies.
Then you turn up.</i>

01:06:40.628 --> 01:06:44.065
It's been a great case
of appendicitis all around.

01:06:44.099 --> 01:06:46.702
Let me get something
to put these in.

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:55.344
Where will you be able
to see these best?

01:06:55.376 --> 01:06:58.112
<i>I see them best
in your two hands.</i>

01:06:58.146 --> 01:07:01.784
I see them best
with you standing right there.

01:07:01.817 --> 01:07:04.786
Just stay like that
for the next couple of days.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.189
What are they
giving you to eat?

01:07:07.222 --> 01:07:09.191
Jell-O, ginger ale.

01:07:09.224 --> 01:07:11.559
Tomorrow I start
on the snails.

01:07:11.592 --> 01:07:13.594
You seem very chipper.

01:07:13.628 --> 01:07:15.231
I am.

01:07:19.634 --> 01:07:21.202
Can I see?

01:07:21.235 --> 01:07:23.438
My stitches?

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:30.046
Okay.

01:07:35.884 --> 01:07:38.519
Is the wound draining?

01:07:38.552 --> 01:07:41.389
Is that tube
dangling down there a drain?

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:45.427
I don't know.
I suppose so. Yeah.

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:49.831
What about the stitches?

01:07:52.666 --> 01:07:55.269
Well,
we're in a hospital.

01:07:55.302 --> 01:07:58.272
What better place
to be when they come undone?

01:07:58.306 --> 01:08:00.608
You're odd, you know?

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:05.380
Odder than I think
you realize.

01:08:05.413 --> 01:08:08.317
I'm always odd after
I have my appendix taken out.

01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:10.318
Do you always
get as big as this

01:08:10.351 --> 01:08:13.321
after you have
your appendix out?

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:16.323
It never fails.

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:18.527
Mm.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.429
Of course, we shouldn't.

01:08:20.462 --> 01:08:22.831
We could both get thrown out
of school for this.

01:08:22.863 --> 01:08:25.100
Then stop.

01:08:36.944 --> 01:08:39.180
"I shot an arrow
into the air.

01:08:39.212 --> 01:08:40.747
It fell to earth
I knew not where."

01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:46.188
Excuse me.

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.323
Oh. Oh, my God.

01:08:49.356 --> 01:08:50.559
<i>W... What is she
going to do now?</i>

01:08:50.591 --> 01:08:52.661
Nothing.

01:08:52.694 --> 01:08:54.496
<i>What do you mean, nothing?
I mean, how can you be so...</i>

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:56.798
poised about all this?

01:08:56.831 --> 01:08:58.734
I mean, one call to the dean,
and we're out.

01:08:58.765 --> 01:09:00.536
How do you know she's
going to do nothing?

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:03.538
She's too embarrassed to.

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:06.375
<i>I don't... I don't understand
how you could be so...</i>

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:07.776
So what?

01:09:07.809 --> 01:09:09.377
<i>Uh...</i>

01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:11.779
Under control.
So expert.

01:09:11.813 --> 01:09:13.747
<i>Oh, yes,</i>

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:16.185
<i>Olivia the expert.</i>

01:09:16.216 --> 01:09:18.519
<i>That's what they called me
at the Menninger Clinic.</i>

01:09:18.551 --> 01:09:19.921
But you are.

01:09:19.953 --> 01:09:22.423
You really think so,
do you?

01:09:24.292 --> 01:09:27.196
I, who have
8,000 moods a minute,

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:29.398
whose every emotion
is a tornado,

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:30.698
who can be thrown
by a word,

01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:33.502
by a syllable,
am under control?

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:37.706
You are blind.

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:50.553
Do you hate me?

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.720
<i>No.</i>

01:09:53.755 --> 01:09:56.725
I don't hate you.

01:09:56.757 --> 01:09:59.260
I think
maybe you hate me.

01:09:59.293 --> 01:10:01.529
Maybe you should.

01:10:12.539 --> 01:10:14.210
Will you come tomorrow?

01:10:17.945 --> 01:10:20.381
Yes.

01:10:46.975 --> 01:10:50.012
I need to see you walk to the end
of the hall and back with this.

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:52.847
Then you can use
the bathroom yourself.

01:11:12.466 --> 01:11:14.635
Marcus.

01:11:14.668 --> 01:11:16.037
- Oh.
- Hey.

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:17.706
Hey, Sonny.

01:11:17.738 --> 01:11:18.939
So, Caudwell sent you?

01:11:18.972 --> 01:11:20.442
Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:20.475 --> 01:11:22.411
It's something we do
at the house, volunteer.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:23.745
Yeah, he said
you gave the okay

01:11:23.778 --> 01:11:25.414
to go into your room,
get your books.

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:27.582
I basically grabbed
everything off the desk.

01:11:27.614 --> 01:11:28.983
Quite a room
you got there.

01:11:29.016 --> 01:11:31.653
Yeah, it's deluxe.

01:11:31.685 --> 01:11:34.088
It was like
a medieval inquisition,

01:11:34.122 --> 01:11:36.057
except he was smiling
most of the time.

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:38.026
I think that's
what annoyed me the most.

01:11:38.059 --> 01:11:39.927
You mind?

01:11:39.961 --> 01:11:42.364
Yeah, yeah. Dig in.

01:11:43.765 --> 01:11:45.901
So you mixed it up
with old Dean Caudwell?

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:47.336
He's actually
not such a bad guy.

01:11:47.368 --> 01:11:49.070
He's just
a blowhard.

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:51.673
He didn't make you move
back in with that moron Foxman

01:11:51.706 --> 01:11:53.108
and that queer
Flusser, did he?

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.975
Hmm? No.

01:11:55.009 --> 01:11:56.478
See?

01:11:56.511 --> 01:11:58.347
Yeah, but then
he started...

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.350
he started grilling me
about my beliefs,

01:12:01.382 --> 01:12:03.751
my social life,
my principles,

01:12:03.784 --> 01:12:05.619
mainly about Chapel.

01:12:05.653 --> 01:12:08.457
I tried to explain
to him as clearly as I could,

01:12:08.489 --> 01:12:11.460
as rationally
as I could,

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:14.463
why the Chapel
requirement is unjust.

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:16.565
I don't...

01:12:16.597 --> 01:12:19.568
I don't know how you and your
fraternity brothers

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.002
take all that Christ stuff
week in, week out?

01:12:22.036 --> 01:12:23.838
Chapel?
Who goes to Chapel?

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.407
You pay someone
to go for you,

01:12:25.439 --> 01:12:27.007
<i>you never have to go
anywhere near Chapel.</i>

01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:29.010
<i>- Is that what you do?
- What else would I do?</i>

01:12:29.042 --> 01:12:31.579
You know, I went
a couple of times freshman year.

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.914
They had a rabbi once,
so I had to go then.

01:12:33.948 --> 01:12:36.818
Otherwise, it's Caudwell
and Donehower

01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:40.821
and all the other great
Ohio spiritual leaders.

01:12:40.854 --> 01:12:43.991
So, how much do you pay?

01:12:44.024 --> 01:12:46.728
Mm, for a proxy?
Two bucks a pop. It's nothing.

01:12:46.761 --> 01:12:48.130
That's not nothing.

01:12:48.162 --> 01:12:50.664
Look, figure you
spend 15 minutes

01:12:50.698 --> 01:12:52.567
getting up the hill
and over to the church,

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.570
an hour subjecting
yourself to Chapel...

01:12:55.603 --> 01:12:58.472
And knowing you, you're seething
with rage the entire time.

01:12:58.506 --> 01:13:01.176
You're probably another
half-hour afterwards still seething.

01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:03.412
That's...

01:13:03.444 --> 01:13:06.814
that's 105 minutes
times 40. That's...

01:13:06.847 --> 01:13:09.551
4,200 minutes.
That's 70 hours.

01:13:09.583 --> 01:13:10.952
Yeah, right.

01:13:10.984 --> 01:13:12.453
And that's
not nothing.

01:13:15.155 --> 01:13:16.858
All right,
so, how does it work?

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:18.692
<i>Well, the guy you hire</i>

01:13:18.725 --> 01:13:20.694
takes the card the usher
hands him at the door,

01:13:20.728 --> 01:13:22.497
and when he hands
it back at the end,

01:13:22.529 --> 01:13:23.731
he's signed
your name on it.

01:13:23.765 --> 01:13:25.467
That's it. Yeah.

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.135
You think a handwriting specialist
pores over each card

01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:28.737
back where
they keep the records?

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:30.539
<i>No. All you have to do
is pay somebody.</i>

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:31.739
Yeah, but who?

01:13:31.773 --> 01:13:33.641
Plenty of brothers
willing to do it.

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:36.077
It's work. I'll find someone
for you if you want me to.

01:13:36.109 --> 01:13:38.880
<i>I can even try to find
someone for less than two bucks.</i>

01:13:38.912 --> 01:13:40.848
But if this person
shoots off his mouth, then what?

01:13:40.881 --> 01:13:42.451
You're out of here
on your ass.

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:45.020
No one would do that.
They'd be out, too.

01:13:45.052 --> 01:13:46.887
Look,
it's a business, Marcus.

01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:50.492
Clearly Dean Caudwell
knows what's going on.

01:13:50.524 --> 01:13:52.827
Caudwell's the biggest
Christer around.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.930
He couldn't imagine why people
don't love listening to Donehower

01:13:55.963 --> 01:13:58.132
instead of having the hour
free every Wednesday

01:13:58.166 --> 01:14:00.135
to jack off
in their rooms.

01:14:00.167 --> 01:14:03.471
No, that was
a big mistake you made

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:05.474
<i>bringing up Chapel
with Caudwell.</i>

01:14:05.506 --> 01:14:07.641
<i>Hawes D. Caudwell is
the idol of this place,</i>

01:14:07.675 --> 01:14:09.677
Winesburg's greatest
halfback in football,

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:11.579
greatest slugger
in baseball,

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:14.583
greatest exponent on Earth of
all things Winesburg tradition.

01:14:14.615 --> 01:14:16.518
<i>Meet this guy head-on
about this stuff,</i>

01:14:16.551 --> 01:14:18.086
<i>and he'll make you
into mush.</i>

01:14:18.118 --> 01:14:19.987
You go around
guys like him, Marcus.

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.789
You... you keep
your mouth shut,

01:14:21.823 --> 01:14:23.825
your ass covered, smile,

01:14:23.858 --> 01:14:26.695
and then you do
whatever you like.

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:30.198
Look, don't... don't take
everything so seriously.

01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:32.733
<i>You might find this
is not the worst place in the world</i>

01:14:32.766 --> 01:14:35.135
<i>to spend the next four years
of your life.</i>

01:14:35.168 --> 01:14:37.572
At least you're
not in Korea. Plus...

01:14:37.604 --> 01:14:39.039
you've already located

01:14:39.073 --> 01:14:41.810
the Blowjob Queen of 1951.
That's a start.

01:14:41.842 --> 01:14:43.644
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:14:43.677 --> 01:14:46.180
<i>You mean she didn't blow you?
You are unique.</i>

01:14:46.213 --> 01:14:49.083
I still don't know what
you are referring to.

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:51.520
Olivia Hutton.

01:14:51.552 --> 01:14:54.256
Look, blowjobs are at a premium
in north-central Ohio.

01:14:54.288 --> 01:14:55.856
As you can imagine,

01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:57.826
news of Olivia
has traveled fast.

01:14:57.859 --> 01:15:00.662
<i>Don't look so puzzled.</i>

01:15:00.694 --> 01:15:02.264
I don't believe this.

01:15:02.296 --> 01:15:04.665
What's not to believe,
hmm?

01:15:04.698 --> 01:15:06.100
She sounds like
a bit of a nutcase.

01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:07.702
<i>There's nothing wrong
with that.</i>

01:15:07.734 --> 01:15:09.170
<i>I wish there were
more of them around.</i>

01:15:09.203 --> 01:15:10.772
<i>I'll pick you up
on Saturday, right?</i>

01:15:10.805 --> 01:15:12.807
<i>That's when you're
getting out of here?</i>

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.976
You okay?

01:15:15.009 --> 01:15:16.578
You want me
to call the nurse?

01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:18.712
No, no.
No, I'm fine.

01:15:18.746 --> 01:15:21.716
I'm just in a little bit
of pain. I'm okay.

01:15:21.748 --> 01:15:24.019
Yeah. Okay.

01:15:24.051 --> 01:15:25.753
I'll see you
Saturday.

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:28.757
<i>We'll set you up
with a cot at the house.</i>

01:16:34.855 --> 01:16:38.594
Now, I want you
to tell me everything.

01:16:40.194 --> 01:16:42.897
Everything?
Everything about what?

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:44.699
About you.

01:16:44.731 --> 01:16:46.701
I want to learn
all about you.

01:16:46.734 --> 01:16:48.637
<i>I want to know
what made you you.</i>

01:16:50.704 --> 01:16:54.109
What about
what made you you?

01:16:54.141 --> 01:16:56.744
<i>You first.</i>

01:16:58.212 --> 01:17:00.915
Well...

01:17:00.948 --> 01:17:03.918
I guess the shop made me me
if anything did.

01:17:03.951 --> 01:17:06.186
Though what
was made exactly,

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.190
I can't say
I entirely know anymore.

01:17:09.222 --> 01:17:12.127
I've been in a very confused
state of mind

01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:13.862
ever since
I hit this place.

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:15.263
Thank you.

01:17:15.296 --> 01:17:17.932
It made you
hard-working. It...

01:17:17.965 --> 01:17:20.402
it gave you integrity.

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:22.837
Oh, did it?
The butcher shop?

01:17:22.869 --> 01:17:24.840
Absolutely.

01:17:27.341 --> 01:17:28.677
Well...

01:17:29.877 --> 01:17:31.913
let me tell you
about my father.

01:17:31.945 --> 01:17:33.681
Let me tell you
about what he gave me

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:35.083
in the way of integrity.

01:17:35.115 --> 01:17:36.851
<i>We'll start with him.</i>

01:17:38.152 --> 01:17:40.788
Oh, good. Story time.

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:43.391
Well, every week...

01:17:43.423 --> 01:17:45.960
the fat man would come
into the store,

01:17:45.993 --> 01:17:47.796
and he'd pick up
all the fat.

01:17:47.828 --> 01:17:50.297
<i>And the fat itself
was stored in a garbage pail.</i>

01:17:50.331 --> 01:17:52.967
<i>After the fat man came,
I would take this can</i>

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.970
<i>out front of the store,
and I would wash it out.</i>

01:17:56.002 --> 01:17:58.806
<i>So one day, one of the
pretty girls from my class</i>

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.208
<i>came up to me
and said,</i>

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.176
"I was stopped
at the bus stop

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:04.445
across the street from
your father's store,

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:07.949
<i>and I saw you cleaning
the garbage cans."</i>

01:18:07.981 --> 01:18:10.251
<i>So, I went
up to my father.</i>

01:18:10.283 --> 01:18:11.853
<i>I said, "Boss"...</i>

01:18:11.886 --> 01:18:13.254
<i>I always
called him "boss."</i>

01:18:13.287 --> 01:18:15.123
<i>I said.
"Boss, I can't clean</i>

01:18:15.155 --> 01:18:16.957
<i>the garbage cans
anymore."</i>

01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:18.359
You were ashamed?

01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:21.128
<i>No. No, you see,
that's what he thought.</i>

01:18:21.162 --> 01:18:23.731
To me, it was practical.

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:25.734
How am I supposed
to ask them out

01:18:25.766 --> 01:18:27.434
if they know
that I clean the cans?

01:18:27.467 --> 01:18:29.002
Well, you asked me out.

01:18:29.036 --> 01:18:31.338
But you didn't see me
clean the garbage cans.

01:18:31.372 --> 01:18:32.807
I could have guessed.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.809
<i>So what did
your father say?</i>

01:18:34.841 --> 01:18:36.411
Did he let you
off the hook?

01:18:36.444 --> 01:18:39.781
No. He said,
"What, you're ashamed?

01:18:39.814 --> 01:18:41.916
What are you
ashamed of?

01:18:41.948 --> 01:18:45.853
All you have to be ashamed
of is stealing, nothing else.

01:18:45.886 --> 01:18:47.922
Clean the cans."

01:18:49.556 --> 01:18:51.760
He could have told
Big Mendelson to do it.

01:18:51.792 --> 01:18:54.161
<i>- Big Mendelson?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

01:18:54.194 --> 01:18:57.765
Yeah, he worked there, too,
until things slowed down.

01:18:59.033 --> 01:19:01.069
Boy, did he have
a nasty mouth on him.

01:19:01.101 --> 01:19:02.170
He belonged in the back,

01:19:02.203 --> 01:19:03.805
trust me,
in the refrigerator.

01:19:03.837 --> 01:19:05.773
I thought
he was hilarious,

01:19:05.806 --> 01:19:07.809
but we had
to let him go.

01:19:07.841 --> 01:19:10.811
What did Big Mendelson do?

01:19:10.845 --> 01:19:12.514
Well, on Thursdays,

01:19:12.546 --> 01:19:14.448
my father, he would come back
from the chicken market.

01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:16.083
He'd dump all
the chickens in a pile,

01:19:16.117 --> 01:19:18.219
<i>and people
would come in,</i>

01:19:18.252 --> 01:19:20.288
<i>pick whatever chicken
they wanted for the weekend.</i>

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.925
Anyway, this one woman,
Mrs. Sklon,

01:19:23.957 --> 01:19:26.059
she would
always come in.

01:19:26.092 --> 01:19:28.162
She'd pick up
a chicken,

01:19:28.195 --> 01:19:30.297
and she'd smell
its mouth

01:19:30.331 --> 01:19:31.900
and then smell
its rear end.

01:19:31.932 --> 01:19:34.301
Got to the point
that one day,

01:19:34.335 --> 01:19:36.069
Big Mendelson, he couldn't
contain himself.

01:19:36.103 --> 01:19:38.506
He said,
"Mrs. Sklon,

01:19:38.538 --> 01:19:41.208
could you pass
that inspection?"

01:19:41.242 --> 01:19:42.844
I swear to God,
I swear,

01:19:42.877 --> 01:19:44.813
I've never seen
anybody get more mad in my life.

01:19:44.845 --> 01:19:46.914
She picked up a knife,
tried to stab the big guy.

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:49.117
So that's why your father
had to let him go?

01:19:49.149 --> 01:19:50.585
<i>Well, he had to.
He had to.</i>

01:19:50.618 --> 01:19:53.588
<i>By then, he said
lots of things like that.</i>

01:19:53.621 --> 01:19:56.591
<i>But about Mrs. Sklon,
Big Mendelson was right.</i>

01:19:56.623 --> 01:19:58.827
She was no picnic,
not even for me,

01:19:58.859 --> 01:20:01.028
and I was the nicest boy
in the world.

01:20:01.061 --> 01:20:03.430
Oh, I never doubted that.

01:20:03.463 --> 01:20:06.167
For better or worse,
that's what I was.

01:20:06.199 --> 01:20:08.368
Am. Are.

01:20:08.402 --> 01:20:11.372
You had humble origins,
like Abe Lincoln.

01:20:11.404 --> 01:20:13.907
Honest Marcus
working side by side

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:15.309
every day
with your father.

01:20:15.342 --> 01:20:17.945
He was...

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:20.949
mm, used to be
something great. That's true.

01:20:20.981 --> 01:20:23.083
Used to be?

01:20:23.117 --> 01:20:26.119
He is.

01:20:26.153 --> 01:20:28.456
So what about
your father?

01:20:28.488 --> 01:20:31.458
He's... He's a doctor.
What kind of medicine?

01:20:31.492 --> 01:20:34.329
You ever see him
working at his office?

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:36.096
My father?

01:20:36.130 --> 01:20:37.931
There's nothing to tell.

01:20:37.965 --> 01:20:39.132
Nothing?

01:20:39.166 --> 01:20:40.534
Nothing.

01:20:40.568 --> 01:20:42.003
Nothing at all.

01:20:42.036 --> 01:20:43.404
<i>Surely
there's something.</i>

01:20:43.436 --> 01:20:45.439
Marcus...

01:20:45.472 --> 01:20:47.274
practice tact.

01:20:57.551 --> 01:20:59.454
You know, I can give you
a recommendation.

01:21:01.055 --> 01:21:02.457
For what?

01:21:02.489 --> 01:21:06.460
A summer job
at Anker's Flower Shop.

01:21:06.493 --> 01:21:08.095
<i>You're a natural.</i>

01:21:25.212 --> 01:21:27.082
You have a guest.

01:21:30.216 --> 01:21:32.453
Markie.

01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:40.328
I don't know
what it is.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.331
Is he sick?
Does he have something?

01:21:43.363 --> 01:21:46.300
Markie, I think
he's losing his mind.

01:21:47.467 --> 01:21:49.037
You know
how he was with you

01:21:49.069 --> 01:21:51.405
on the phone
about the operation?

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:53.274
That's how he is
with everyone,

01:21:53.306 --> 01:21:55.576
about everything
all the time.

01:21:55.609 --> 01:21:58.579
At the store, he's yelling
at the customers.

01:21:58.612 --> 01:22:01.416
And my God, in the car,
in the truck.

01:22:01.448 --> 01:22:04.117
He's been driving
around Essex County all his life,

01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:07.121
and suddenly everyone on the
road is a maniac except for him.

01:22:07.154 --> 01:22:08.723
The horn,
he honks the horn

01:22:08.756 --> 01:22:11.292
from the second
we leave the driveway.

01:22:11.324 --> 01:22:14.295
We're losing customers,
Markie.

01:22:14.328 --> 01:22:16.364
They all go
to the supermarket now,

01:22:16.396 --> 01:22:17.465
and who can blame them?

01:22:17.497 --> 01:22:19.634
People call,
I take their orders,

01:22:19.667 --> 01:22:21.469
make
some conversation.

01:22:21.502 --> 01:22:23.504
He used to like that I talked
to the customers.

01:22:23.537 --> 01:22:25.306
Now he grabs the phone
from my hand.

01:22:25.338 --> 01:22:27.675
"You want to talk to my wife,
you call at night,

01:22:27.707 --> 01:22:30.610
not during business hours,"
and he hangs up.

01:22:30.644 --> 01:22:33.981
What's happened, Markie?

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:38.552
Have I been living all these years
with a time bomb?

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:42.556
All I know is that something
has made my husband

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:45.060
into a different person,
into a monster.

01:22:47.161 --> 01:22:48.529
You should have
told me, Mom.

01:22:48.561 --> 01:22:50.331
You should have told me
how bad it was getting.

01:22:50.363 --> 01:22:51.498
I'm sorry.

01:22:51.532 --> 01:22:53.266
Why should I bother you

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.436
at school
with your studies?

01:22:57.037 --> 01:22:58.672
Yeah, take him
to a doctor.

01:22:58.706 --> 01:23:00.375
Take him
to Dr. Shildkret.

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:02.510
Maybe he can...

01:23:02.542 --> 01:23:05.445
give him something
to calm down.

01:23:05.479 --> 01:23:07.048
He won't go.

01:23:07.081 --> 01:23:08.449
He refuses to go.

01:23:08.481 --> 01:23:10.051
There's nothing
wrong with him.

01:23:10.083 --> 01:23:12.019
It's the rest of the world
that's in the wrong.

01:23:12.052 --> 01:23:13.421
Then you see Shildkret.

01:23:13.453 --> 01:23:15.590
Ma, you're as strong
as a person can be,

01:23:15.622 --> 01:23:17.491
and you've become a wreck.
He's killing you.

01:23:17.524 --> 01:23:20.795
Oh, Markie,
darling.

01:23:20.828 --> 01:23:22.397
Should I?

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:24.365
Can I possibly?

01:23:25.733 --> 01:23:29.103
I came all this way
to ask you.

01:23:29.136 --> 01:23:31.306
You're the only one
I can ask about this.

01:23:33.073 --> 01:23:35.643
Could you possibly what?

01:23:35.676 --> 01:23:37.178
What?

01:23:37.211 --> 01:23:38.579
I can't say the word.

01:23:38.612 --> 01:23:40.215
What word?

01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:43.785
Divorce.

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:46.454
Oh, Ma.

01:23:46.487 --> 01:23:48.588
Ma, you're
in a state of shock.

01:23:48.622 --> 01:23:50.758
You don't know what
you're saying. This...

01:23:50.791 --> 01:23:53.494
you've been married
to him for 25 years.

01:23:53.527 --> 01:23:55.363
- You love him.
- I don't.

01:23:56.863 --> 01:23:59.299
I hate him.

01:23:59.332 --> 01:24:03.203
I sit in the car as he's driving
and screaming at me,

01:24:03.237 --> 01:24:04.838
and I hate him
and loathe him

01:24:04.872 --> 01:24:06.474
from the bottom
of my heart.

01:24:06.506 --> 01:24:08.175
<i>I, It isn't true.</i>

01:24:08.208 --> 01:24:09.577
Even if it seems so,

01:24:09.609 --> 01:24:11.545
it's not
a permanent condition.

01:24:11.578 --> 01:24:16.550
Just see
Dr. Shildkret, please,

01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:19.086
at least as a start.

01:24:19.119 --> 01:24:20.521
Do it for me.

01:24:21.822 --> 01:24:23.623
I'm seeing a lawyer.

01:24:23.657 --> 01:24:24.759
What?!

01:24:24.792 --> 01:24:25.793
<i>Yes.</i>

01:24:25.826 --> 01:24:27.395
I've already seen him.

01:24:28.863 --> 01:24:31.332
I have an attorney.

01:24:51.351 --> 01:24:54.255
So you met in American,
you said?

01:24:54.287 --> 01:24:57.157
American History
to 1865.

01:24:57.190 --> 01:25:00.795
I'm also taking Principles
of American Government,

01:25:00.828 --> 01:25:02.830
but Olivia is just
in American History.

01:25:02.863 --> 01:25:05.833
That's why she brought
the textbook, Mom, so I can study.

01:25:05.865 --> 01:25:09.737
Your son, Mrs. Messner,
is a star student.

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:13.474
He always asks the most interesting
questions in class.

01:25:13.506 --> 01:25:16.911
I wouldn't be surprised
if Professor Sundquist

01:25:16.944 --> 01:25:19.580
<i>weren't a bit intimidated
by Marcus.</i>

01:25:19.613 --> 01:25:22.350
Marcus has always been
a straight-A student.

01:25:22.382 --> 01:25:24.551
It's because of that
he has been awarded the scholarship.

01:25:24.585 --> 01:25:25.819
And you,

01:25:25.853 --> 01:25:28.155
Miss Hutton,
do you...

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:30.859
are you enjoying
your studies?

01:25:33.327 --> 01:25:36.297
I enjoy the books, yes.

01:25:36.329 --> 01:25:38.599
I'm going to be
a French Literature major.

01:25:38.631 --> 01:25:40.701
French literature.

01:25:40.734 --> 01:25:43.304
Is this something of which your
parents approve?

01:25:43.337 --> 01:25:47.307
Well, my father is
a very practical man,

01:25:47.341 --> 01:25:49.810
but he hasn't suggested
any alternative,

01:25:49.842 --> 01:25:51.412
so I have to assume
that he believes,

01:25:51.444 --> 01:25:52.913
from a practical
perspective,

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:55.550
that it would be a waste of his time
to think about it.

01:25:55.582 --> 01:25:58.418
And your mother,
Miss Hutton?

01:25:58.452 --> 01:26:01.588
<i>Well, my mother isn't
very practical at all,</i>

01:26:01.622 --> 01:26:04.192
but she has visited Paris
and loved it,

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:07.528
so I think I should have her
vote if it should come to it.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.463
Sounds like you have
a very democratic household.

01:26:10.497 --> 01:26:12.233
That's very American.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.570
Yes, we are, American.

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:19.907
Though as a student of American
civilization, Marcus,

01:26:19.939 --> 01:26:22.909
you must remember how Benjamin
Franklin once defined democracy.

01:26:22.943 --> 01:26:25.378
"Democracy," he said,

01:26:25.412 --> 01:26:28.416
"is two wolves and a lamb voting
on what to have for lunch."

01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:18.725
Ma.

01:28:18.759 --> 01:28:21.628
Marcus, I won't
divorce him.

01:28:24.131 --> 01:28:26.067
I'll bear him.

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:28.303
I'll do all I can
to help him.

01:28:29.903 --> 01:28:33.440
I'm sorry I even allowed myself
to have such thoughts.

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:36.110
I'm sorry
I told them to you.

01:28:36.143 --> 01:28:38.712
The way that I did it,
here at this hospital,

01:28:38.746 --> 01:28:41.716
with you just out of bed and
starting to walk around on your own,

01:28:41.748 --> 01:28:44.719
that wasn't right.
I apologize.

01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:47.689
I wasn't
thinking of you.

01:28:49.155 --> 01:28:52.126
Marcus,
you appear so strong,

01:28:52.158 --> 01:28:54.627
you are
in so many ways,

01:28:54.661 --> 01:28:58.065
that I forget you are a boy,
a very sensitive boy...

01:28:59.466 --> 01:29:02.070
a boy who loves
and honors his father.

01:29:05.405 --> 01:29:06.774
Yeah,
you can cry, Markie.

01:29:06.806 --> 01:29:09.010
- Ah, Ma.
- I've seen you cry before.

01:29:10.778 --> 01:29:13.447
I know.
I know I can. I know.

01:29:13.479 --> 01:29:16.116
I just don't want to.

01:29:19.853 --> 01:29:22.556
Thank you.

01:29:22.588 --> 01:29:23.791
Thank you, Ma.

01:29:23.823 --> 01:29:26.426
This is a great
relief to me.

01:29:27.994 --> 01:29:30.898
I couldn't imagine him
living all alone.

01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:32.500
It was unimaginable.

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:34.469
Don't imagine it.

01:29:39.105 --> 01:29:42.510
But now I must ask
for something in return,

01:29:42.542 --> 01:29:45.512
because something
is unimaginable to me.

01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:50.917
I never asked
anything of you before.

01:29:50.951 --> 01:29:52.720
I never asked,
because I never had to,

01:29:52.752 --> 01:29:55.188
because you are perfect
where sons are concerned.

01:29:55.221 --> 01:29:58.858
All you've ever wanted
to be is a boy who does well.

01:29:58.891 --> 01:30:01.729
You have been the best son
a mother could have.

01:30:01.761 --> 01:30:03.163
But I am
going to ask you

01:30:03.197 --> 01:30:06.434
to have nothing more
to do with Miss Hutton...

01:30:06.466 --> 01:30:09.737
because for you to be with her
is unimaginable for me.

01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:12.105
Ma...

01:30:12.139 --> 01:30:14.074
Markie, you are here
to be a student

01:30:14.106 --> 01:30:15.975
and to study
the Supreme Court

01:30:16.009 --> 01:30:17.978
and to prepare
to go to law school.

01:30:18.011 --> 01:30:20.714
You are here so someday you will
become a person in the community

01:30:20.747 --> 01:30:24.552
that other people look up to
and that they come to for help.

01:30:24.585 --> 01:30:27.121
You are here so you don't
have to be a Messner

01:30:27.154 --> 01:30:29.723
and work in a butcher shop
for the rest of your life.

01:30:29.756 --> 01:30:31.926
You are not here
to look for trouble

01:30:31.958 --> 01:30:34.194
with a girl who has taken
a razor and slit her wrists.

01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:36.197
Wrist.
She slit one wrist.

01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:38.998
One is enough.

01:30:39.032 --> 01:30:43.002
We have only two,
and one is too much.

01:30:43.036 --> 01:30:44.704
Ma, you don't understand.

01:30:44.738 --> 01:30:46.106
You think
I don't understand?

01:30:46.139 --> 01:30:48.476
You don't.
You don't understand.

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:49.877
Markie, I will stay
with your father,

01:30:49.909 --> 01:30:52.579
but for this,
I am offering a deal.

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:55.149
Markie, the world
is full of young women

01:30:55.181 --> 01:30:57.016
who have
not slit any wrists,

01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:58.619
who have slit nothing.

01:30:58.652 --> 01:31:00.253
They exist
by the millions.

01:31:00.287 --> 01:31:01.655
Find one of them.

01:31:01.688 --> 01:31:03.757
<i>She can be
a Gentile.</i>

01:31:03.789 --> 01:31:05.059
<i>She can
be anything.</i>

01:31:05.091 --> 01:31:06.893
<i>This is 1951.</i>

01:31:06.926 --> 01:31:09.095
<i>You don't live in the Old World.
Why should you?</i>

01:31:09.128 --> 01:31:11.599
Date anyone you want,
marry anyone you want,

01:31:11.631 --> 01:31:13.533
do whatever you want
with whoever you choose,

01:31:13.567 --> 01:31:15.869
as long as she's never
put a razor to herself.

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:19.173
<i>A girl so wounded
as to do such a thing</i>

01:31:19.206 --> 01:31:20.673
<i>will wipe out
everything</i>

01:31:20.707 --> 01:31:23.143
<i>before your life
has even begun.</i>

01:31:23.176 --> 01:31:25.846
Ma, you don't understand.

01:31:25.878 --> 01:31:28.114
It's not as serious
a relationship as you think.

01:31:28.148 --> 01:31:30.284
Serious?
She is serious for you,

01:31:30.317 --> 01:31:33.287
because she is suffering,
she is weak.

01:31:33.319 --> 01:31:36.023
And weak people,
Markie, weak people are not harmless.

01:31:36.055 --> 01:31:38.024
Their weakness
is their strength.

01:31:38.057 --> 01:31:41.895
<i>A person so unstable
is a menace to you, Markie.</i>

01:31:41.929 --> 01:31:44.097
<i>And she is a beautiful
young woman.</i>

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:46.534
<i>She looks
like a goddess.</i>

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:48.903
Obviously she's
well brought up.

01:31:50.170 --> 01:31:52.239
Though maybe there is
more to her upbringing

01:31:52.271 --> 01:31:53.841
than meets the eye.

01:31:53.873 --> 01:31:55.608
You never know
about those things,

01:31:55.641 --> 01:31:58.144
about what goes on
in people's houses.

01:31:58.177 --> 01:32:00.113
When the child
goes wrong,

01:32:00.146 --> 01:32:01.748
look to the family.

01:32:03.082 --> 01:32:07.020
<i>Regardless, my heart
goes out to her.</i>

01:32:07.054 --> 01:32:08.622
<i>I pray for her.</i>

01:32:08.654 --> 01:32:11.057
<i>I have nothing
against her.</i>

01:32:11.091 --> 01:32:14.128
But you,
you are my son...

01:32:15.862 --> 01:32:18.065
and my only child...

01:32:19.231 --> 01:32:21.335
and I am your mother,

01:32:21.368 --> 01:32:24.772
who will, who must
do anything for you.

01:32:24.805 --> 01:32:26.606
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:35.949
I understand.

01:32:37.050 --> 01:32:38.619
I understand.

01:32:38.652 --> 01:32:40.921
And that means
you will promise,

01:32:40.953 --> 01:32:43.590
no matter the tears,
the pleas from her, no matter...

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:48.229
you promise
this will end now.

01:32:58.971 --> 01:33:01.007
You promise?

01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:04.144
I promise.

01:33:06.279 --> 01:33:08.149
I promise.

01:33:12.185 --> 01:33:14.254
<i>...by late 1747,</i>

01:33:14.287 --> 01:33:16.957
<i>Celeron was marching
with over 200 French troops</i>

01:33:16.989 --> 01:33:19.626
<i>and a party of Indians
down through Pennsylvania</i>

01:33:19.659 --> 01:33:22.630
<i>and then southwest
over here to the Ohio country,</i>

01:33:22.662 --> 01:33:26.032
<i>reaching Pickawillany, where
the Ohio and Miami rivers meet</i>

01:33:26.065 --> 01:33:28.268
<i>and where Celeron engaged</i>

01:33:28.301 --> 01:33:31.038
<i>with the Miami Indian chief
known as Old Briton,</i>

01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:32.840
<i>who he threatened</i>

01:33:32.872 --> 01:33:35.842
<i>for continuing to betray him
with the British.</i>

01:33:40.413 --> 01:33:42.349
We have a wonderful
weekend planned.

01:33:42.381 --> 01:33:44.117
Going to Kenyon
with some brothers.

01:33:44.150 --> 01:33:46.252
That prick Harding just sprang
another another paper on us.

01:33:46.286 --> 01:33:47.855
There goes
my weekend.

01:33:47.887 --> 01:33:49.789
Harding? What are you
complaining about?

01:33:49.823 --> 01:33:51.158
He's the easiest grader
at Winesburg.

01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:52.425
<i>What class?
For World Empires?</i>

01:33:52.458 --> 01:33:54.728
<i>- Yeah.
- Had it last year.</i>

01:33:54.761 --> 01:33:57.297
<i>Honestly, just copy
off the Britannica entry,</i>

01:33:57.329 --> 01:34:00.300
<i>and he never sees it.
"B," guaranteed.</i>

01:34:00.332 --> 01:34:01.734
<i>Better yet,
just copy my paper.</i>

01:34:01.768 --> 01:34:03.770
<i>I have it
upstairs somewhere.</i>

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:05.439
<i>That'd be great.
You know, I still owe you</i>

01:34:05.471 --> 01:34:07.106
<i>for that Nestrick paper
from last year.</i>

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:09.076
<i>No problem. Anytime.</i>

01:34:09.109 --> 01:34:12.012
Sonny says you're in the market
for a proxy at Chapel.

01:34:12.045 --> 01:34:14.782
I got it all out of the way by
the end of sophomore year,

01:34:14.814 --> 01:34:17.216
and I just polished off
Kessler's last three,

01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:19.286
so I'm a free agent.

01:34:19.319 --> 01:34:21.288
<i>Sonny says you're
on scholarship.</i>

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:24.225
<i>I'll cut my fee
to a buck and a half. Deal?</i>

01:34:25.492 --> 01:34:27.161
Sure.

01:34:29.362 --> 01:34:34.467
By definition,
the slope is given by "M",

01:34:34.501 --> 01:34:36.804
<i>which is
the change in "Y"</i>

01:34:36.837 --> 01:34:38.205
<i>over the change
in "X,"</i>

01:34:38.238 --> 01:34:43.844
<i>or delta "Y"
by delta "X."</i>

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:10.971
Yes, I'm trying to reach
Miss Olivia Hutton.

01:35:11.003 --> 01:35:12.238
Is she there?

01:35:13.873 --> 01:35:16.109
Uh-huh.

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:18.945
Yes, that's me.
I left word yesterday.

01:35:20.113 --> 01:35:21.481
I know.

01:35:23.850 --> 01:35:25.419
What was that?

01:35:25.452 --> 01:35:27.887
<i>Olivia Hutton
is no longer here.</i>

01:35:27.921 --> 01:35:29.155
<i>She's gone home.</i>

01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:31.525
Home? You mean
she's visiting home?

01:35:31.557 --> 01:35:34.528
<i>She's gone.
There's no reason to be calling here.</i>

01:35:53.479 --> 01:35:56.115
Is Dean Caudwell free,
if he has a minute?

01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:57.918
Why don't
you have a seat

01:35:57.951 --> 01:36:00.287
and we'll find out
if he can see you.

01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:23.110
Dean Caudwell,
Marcus Messner is here.

01:36:23.143 --> 01:36:24.944
<i>Caudwell:
Bring him in.</i>

01:36:37.556 --> 01:36:38.925
You look well,
Marcus.

01:36:38.958 --> 01:36:40.993
Maybe lost
a pound or two,

01:36:41.027 --> 01:36:42.529
but otherwise
you look fine.

01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:46.365
Dean Caudwell...

01:36:46.399 --> 01:36:48.468
I don't know
who else to turn to

01:36:48.501 --> 01:36:52.372
about something that is
very important to me.

01:36:52.404 --> 01:36:54.173
I didn't mean to throw up here,
you know.

01:36:54.207 --> 01:36:56.944
You fell ill,
and you were sick,

01:36:56.976 --> 01:36:58.612
and that's that.

01:36:58.645 --> 01:37:02.349
Lucky we got you
to the hospital in time.

01:37:02.381 --> 01:37:04.417
What can I do for you?

01:37:07.654 --> 01:37:10.958
I'm here about
a female student.

01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:13.359
She was
in my history class,

01:37:13.393 --> 01:37:16.363
and now she is gone.

01:37:16.395 --> 01:37:17.997
I told you
I'd been on one date.

01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:19.399
It had been with her.

01:37:19.431 --> 01:37:22.402
Her name
is Olivia Hutton.

01:37:22.435 --> 01:37:25.239
Now she has disappeared.

01:37:25.271 --> 01:37:27.306
I would like to know
what happened to her.

01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:29.009
I'm afraid something
terrible happened,

01:37:29.042 --> 01:37:32.613
and I'm afraid I may have
had something to do with it.

01:37:32.645 --> 01:37:35.014
What is it
you think you did

01:37:35.047 --> 01:37:36.449
that makes
you think this?

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:41.588
I took her out
on a date.

01:37:41.621 --> 01:37:44.123
Did something
happen on that date

01:37:44.157 --> 01:37:45.993
you want
to tell me about?

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.295
No, sir.

01:37:49.529 --> 01:37:51.398
Dean.

01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:54.300
I'm "Dean"
to you, please.

01:37:54.333 --> 01:37:58.137
The answer is no,
Dean Caudwell.

01:37:58.171 --> 01:38:00.474
Nothing happened that I would like
to tell you about.

01:38:03.243 --> 01:38:05.545
Did you impregnate
this young lady, Marcus?

01:38:05.578 --> 01:38:08.048
No... what?! No!

01:38:08.081 --> 01:38:09.483
You're sure?

01:38:09.515 --> 01:38:11.284
Absolutely sure.

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:13.552
She wasn't pregnant,
as far as you know?

01:38:13.586 --> 01:38:15.155
No.

01:38:15.188 --> 01:38:18.292
You didn't force yourself
on Olivia Hutton?

01:38:18.324 --> 01:38:21.161
No, sir. I did not
force myself on her.

01:38:23.329 --> 01:38:26.300
She came and visited you
in your hospital room, did she not?

01:38:26.332 --> 01:38:28.301
Uh...

01:38:28.335 --> 01:38:30.604
Yes.
Yes, she did, Dean.

01:38:30.636 --> 01:38:33.172
According to a member
of the hospital staff,

01:38:33.206 --> 01:38:36.176
something occurred between
the two of you at the hospital.

01:38:36.208 --> 01:38:38.644
Something sordid
occurred

01:38:38.677 --> 01:38:41.213
that was observed
and duly noted.

01:38:41.247 --> 01:38:44.017
Yet you say you didn't
force yourself on her.

01:38:44.050 --> 01:38:45.686
I had just had
my appendix taken out.

01:38:45.719 --> 01:38:48.587
That doesn't answer
my question.

01:38:48.621 --> 01:38:51.057
No, sir, I did not.

01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:54.061
I've never used force
on anyone in my life.

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:55.962
I've never had to.

01:38:55.996 --> 01:38:57.663
You didn't have to.

01:38:57.697 --> 01:38:59.699
May I ask
what that means?

01:38:59.733 --> 01:39:01.702
No. No, you can't.

01:39:03.502 --> 01:39:06.273
Dean Caudwell, this is very hard
for me to talk about,

01:39:06.305 --> 01:39:07.707
but I do think
that whatever happened

01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:10.243
in the privacy
of my hospital room

01:39:10.275 --> 01:39:12.045
was strictly
between Olivia and myself.

01:39:12.078 --> 01:39:14.982
Perhaps,
and perhaps not,

01:39:15.015 --> 01:39:18.252
especially in light
of the circumstances.

01:39:19.418 --> 01:39:20.386
Why?

01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:22.689
Olivia Hutton

01:39:22.721 --> 01:39:25.692
had a nervous
breakdown, Marcus.

01:39:25.725 --> 01:39:28.729
She had to be taken away
in an ambulance.

01:39:37.670 --> 01:39:39.306
I really don't know

01:39:39.338 --> 01:39:42.009
what goes into
a nervous breakdown.

01:39:43.409 --> 01:39:47.247
You lose control
over yourself and your emotions,

01:39:47.279 --> 01:39:50.016
like an infant.

01:39:50.050 --> 01:39:53.253
You have to be
hospitalized and cared for

01:39:53.286 --> 01:39:57.256
like an infant
until you recover,

01:39:57.289 --> 01:40:00.460
if you ever do recover.

01:40:00.493 --> 01:40:03.263
The college took a chance
with Olivia Hutton.

01:40:03.296 --> 01:40:05.532
We knew
her mental history,

01:40:05.564 --> 01:40:08.434
the relapses,
electroshock treatments,

01:40:08.467 --> 01:40:11.037
but her father
is a Cleveland surgeon

01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:14.041
and a distinguished
alumnus at Winesburg,

01:40:14.073 --> 01:40:17.810
and so we took her in
at Dr. Hutton's request.

01:40:17.844 --> 01:40:21.681
Things didn't work out
very well for any of us.

01:40:21.713 --> 01:40:24.417
They especially
didn't work out for Olivia.

01:40:25.685 --> 01:40:27.254
She is where?

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:30.356
At a hospital specializing
in psychiatric care.

01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:34.194
She can't possibly
be pregnant, too.

01:40:34.226 --> 01:40:35.728
Time will tell.

01:40:39.599 --> 01:40:43.503
It's not me.

01:40:43.536 --> 01:40:47.707
What was reported to us about
your conduct at the hospital

01:40:47.739 --> 01:40:49.509
suggests it could be,
Marcus.

01:40:49.542 --> 01:40:52.312
I don't care
what it suggests.

01:40:52.345 --> 01:40:56.182
Dean Caudwell,
I will not be condemned

01:40:56.216 --> 01:40:59.352
on the basis
of no evidence.

01:40:59.385 --> 01:41:04.190
Sir, I resent, once again,

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:06.126
your portrayal of me.

01:41:06.158 --> 01:41:09.795
I did not have sexual intercourse
with Olivia Hutton.

01:41:09.828 --> 01:41:13.099
I have never had sexual intercourse
with anyone.

01:41:13.132 --> 01:41:15.335
Nobody in this world

01:41:15.368 --> 01:41:17.604
could possibly be pregnant
because of me.

01:41:17.636 --> 01:41:19.605
It is impossible.

01:41:19.639 --> 01:41:21.274
Marcus,
it is possible.

01:41:21.306 --> 01:41:23.176
Ah, fuck you, it is.

01:41:55.475 --> 01:41:56.510
<i>ROTC students:
Right!</i>

01:41:57.644 --> 01:41:58.612
Right!

01:41:58.645 --> 01:42:00.814
Right!

01:42:00.846 --> 01:42:01.914
Right!

01:42:01.948 --> 01:42:03.850
- Sound off.
- Sound off.

01:42:03.882 --> 01:42:05.784
- Sound off.
- Sound off.

01:42:05.818 --> 01:42:07.688
1, 2, 3, 4...

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:58.938
<i>To what do we owe
this outbreak of moral laxity?</i>

01:42:58.971 --> 01:43:01.942
To what do we owe
this shameful fall from grace

01:43:01.975 --> 01:43:03.877
and from Winesburg tradition?

01:43:03.909 --> 01:43:07.447
A drunken brawl
outside The Owl this weekend.

01:43:07.479 --> 01:43:09.882
Two students suspended
for cheating

01:43:09.916 --> 01:43:12.920
on their mathematics
midterm examination.

01:43:14.386 --> 01:43:16.488
Let there be no mistake.

01:43:16.521 --> 01:43:20.492
As God looks scornfully down
upon this assembly today,

01:43:20.525 --> 01:43:23.963
he regards a community
that has lost its way.

01:43:23.997 --> 01:43:26.566
<i>God's all-encompassing vision</i>

01:43:26.599 --> 01:43:30.569
<i>will from this day forward
find ample supplement</i>

01:43:30.603 --> 01:43:34.240
<i>with a renewed
and reinvigorated supervision</i>

01:43:34.274 --> 01:43:37.911
<i>from me and from the entire
administrative staff.</i>

01:43:37.944 --> 01:43:42.316
<i>Let there be
no mistake about that.</i>

01:44:23.588 --> 01:44:26.393
<i>I wonder if everyone,</i>

01:44:26.426 --> 01:44:28.395
<i>after they die,</i>

01:44:28.427 --> 01:44:30.363
<i>remembers
all the little details</i>

01:44:30.395 --> 01:44:32.298
<i>and decisions they made,</i>

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:36.302
<i>all the reasons they ended up
ending the exact way they did.</i>

01:44:38.837 --> 01:44:40.673
<i>That's how I am.</i>

01:44:40.707 --> 01:44:43.543
<i>I remember and replay
those things,</i>

01:44:43.576 --> 01:44:47.480
<i>even if I can't remember
how long I've been remembering.</i>

01:44:47.512 --> 01:44:49.849
<i>Maybe it's been forever.</i>

01:44:49.881 --> 01:44:52.851
<i>And I speak to everyone,</i>

01:44:52.885 --> 01:44:55.889
<i>Ma, Pa, Olivia,</i>

01:44:55.921 --> 01:44:57.756
<i>everyone,</i>

01:44:57.789 --> 01:45:02.761
<i>even if they've been dead
already a million years.</i>

01:45:02.795 --> 01:45:06.399
<i>But I keep speaking to them.</i>

01:45:06.431 --> 01:45:08.100
<i>Forever.</i>

01:45:18.944 --> 01:45:20.746
<i>Hey!</i>

01:45:46.972 --> 01:45:49.076
<i>Can you hear me, Olivia?</i>

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:54.781
<i>Can you hear me when I
tell you that it's okay,</i>

01:45:54.814 --> 01:45:57.784
<i>whatever it is,</i>

01:45:57.817 --> 01:45:59.586
<i>that it's okay?</i>

01:46:04.122 --> 01:46:06.592
<i>'Cause someone did love you.</i>

01:46:09.662 --> 01:46:12.632
<i>At least,
I think that's what it was.</i>

01:46:15.501 --> 01:46:18.471
<i>And you should know that.</i>

01:46:18.503 --> 01:46:21.073
<i>You should know, Olivia.</i>

01:46:23.542 --> 01:46:25.077
<i>You should know.</i>

01:46:26.679 --> 01:46:29.047
Mrs. Anderson.

01:46:29.081 --> 01:46:31.117
Olivia.

01:46:31.149 --> 01:46:32.952
Your pills.
