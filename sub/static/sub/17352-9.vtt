God isn't for you, Lenny.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.934
God is for men who have no use for freedom.

00:26.903 --> 00:29.895
You're wrong about abortion.

00:29.989 --> 00:34.028
You're spreading a sorrow
you don't even understand.

00:34.118 --> 00:36.700
And that's the worst thing
a human being can do.

00:38.122 --> 00:42.206
You've made the kind of mistake
that should have been avoided at all cost.

00:42.293 --> 00:46.036
Introducing concepts that,
taken by themselves, are true

00:46.130 --> 00:51.591
but which, when lumped together,
constitute a system that's overly rigid.

00:54.472 --> 00:58.431
LENNY: When it comes to abortion,
rigidity is the only option.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.894
There's no getting around it.

01:00.978 --> 01:04.095
It's a crime, forbidden and punished

01:04.190 --> 01:08.229
in the book of Exodus 21: 22-25.

01:08.319 --> 01:10.435
You know that.

01:10.529 --> 01:15.865
"22: When men have a fight
and injure a pregnant woman

01:15.952 --> 01:19.240
"and she suffers a miscarriage
but no further injury,

01:19.330 --> 01:21.696
"the guilty one shall be fined

01:21.791 --> 01:24.624
"as much as the woman's husband demands,

01:24.710 --> 01:27.918
"and he shall pay
in the presence of the judges."

01:28.005 --> 01:32.795
"23: But if injury ensues,
you shall pay life for life.

01:32.885 --> 01:36.377
"24: Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,

01:36.472 --> 01:39.430

01:41.852 --> 01:43.513

01:46.691 --> 01:48.932
The Church has always
maintained this tradition,

01:49.026 --> 01:53.065
and it is only modern laxity

01:53.155 --> 01:56.773
that wishes to turn sins into rights.

01:58.202 --> 01:59.863
Not to encourage them.

02:01.497 --> 02:04.034
No one is actually in favor of abortion,

02:04.125 --> 02:07.333
but to undermine the principle of authority.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.502
Oh, come on, Lenny.

02:09.588 --> 02:13.581
You know these verses
are a little more complicated than that.

02:13.676 --> 02:17.419
Yes, the litigant pays damages
in the case of an abortion

02:17.513 --> 02:22.974
or suffers death if the woman dies
in the course of losing the baby,

02:23.060 --> 02:25.346
but that's not what this is about.

02:25.438 --> 02:29.022
This is about compassion, empathy.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.143
LENNY: Bouvier?

02:30.234 --> 02:34.022
Are you seriously gonna waste my time
with the Bouvier nonsense?

02:34.113 --> 02:36.525
Post-Revolutionary France?

02:36.615 --> 02:38.947
Or the bullshit of Saint Alphonsus?

02:39.035 --> 02:41.492
It isn't bullshit, Lenny.

02:41.579 --> 02:45.572
That abortion is a grave moral disorder
is not open for debate.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.827
That's what Saint John Paul II said,
and those three words,

02:50.921 --> 02:55.790
"grave," "moral," and "disorder"
are based on papal infallibility.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.763
And yet, in 1591,

03:00.931 --> 03:05.641
Pope Gregory XIV,
with the Sedes Apostolica bull,

03:07.021 --> 03:11.685
restricted excommunication to the abortion
of an ensouled fetus,

03:12.943 --> 03:15.685
introducing a distinction

03:15.780 --> 03:19.238
that argues against lumping together

03:19.325 --> 03:20.781
disparate situations.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.496
I'm sick and tired of distinctions.

03:26.082 --> 03:28.573
Even for Saint Thomas Aquinas

03:28.667 --> 03:31.374
and right up until the middle
of the 19th century,

03:31.462 --> 03:36.707
abortion was said to take place
only after the ensoulment of the fetus,

03:36.801 --> 03:40.385
and that occurs in the third month
of pregnancy.

03:40.471 --> 03:42.837
Science is the gift of God,

03:42.932 --> 03:45.765
and God taught us that ovulation
is spontaneous.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.475
Ask a woman about that.

03:49.980 --> 03:54.064
Back when it was still believed
that there were two kinds of insemination,

03:54.151 --> 03:58.815
male insemination involving sperm,
female insemination involving eggs,

03:58.906 --> 04:02.444
it was considered a sin
not to give a woman pleasure.

04:02.535 --> 04:07.029
But then, when it was discovered
that ovulation was spontaneous,

04:07.123 --> 04:10.331
the cost was several billion female orgasms.

I implore you, Lenny,

04:28.727 --> 04:32.140
reconsider your position on abortion.

04:32.231 --> 04:36.099
Tough in principle, soft in practice.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.993

on the side table of nothingness.

05:02.803 --> 05:08.890
Life is meant to be used and to be used well,
to love and be loved.

05:10.144 --> 05:13.307
And let me remind you
what Saint Alphonsus said about abortion.

05:14.690 --> 05:20.060
In an abortion, everyone is guilty,
except for the woman.

05:24.033 --> 05:26.524
What if it wasn't only true of abortion?

05:28.287 --> 05:33.327
What if, in things of life, everyone is guilty,
except for the woman?

05:41.759 --> 05:43.590

the person I miss is Mr. Jack Walser.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.982
He was the superintendent
of the building where we lived,

08:13.077 --> 08:14.442
before the Lord called me to him.

08:15.871 --> 08:18.157
He'd divided the tenants into two categories.

08:25.923 --> 08:28.164
One day,

08:28.258 --> 08:32.092
Jack rang our doorbell
at 10:00 in the morning,

08:33.847 --> 08:36.759
confident that Lucy and I would be at school.

08:37.935 --> 08:42.349
But that day, we were in bed, sick with a fever,

08:42.439 --> 08:44.521
happy to be safe at home.

08:47.861 --> 08:53.982
Through the bedroom door,
I saw my mother offer him a cup of coffee,

08:54.076 --> 08:58.194
which Jack drank it standing up
because he didn't want to get the chair wet

08:58.288 --> 09:01.200

09:03.627 --> 09:07.415

bad he had come to say,

09:07.506 --> 09:08.495
something important.

09:10.134 --> 09:13.547
And then Mr. Walser announced to my mother

09:13.637 --> 09:17.550
that the landlords had decided to implement

09:17.641 --> 09:20.678

48:42.712 --> 48:44.213
It'll only be a big waste of time.

48:45.298 --> 48:46.538
For me and for you.

48:47.884 --> 48:50.375
You don't have any solid
evidence, you and your Pope.

48:51.805 --> 48:52.840
None.

48:53.973 --> 48:59.434
Only the demented ravings of a lunatic
who goes around with orange hair.

48:59.521 --> 49:02.263
No one will believe you. No one.

49:03.483 --> 49:05.519
We don'tjust have that testimony.

49:07.362 --> 49:08.477
Oh, really?

49:09.322 --> 49:10.687
Just what do you think you have?

49:54.576 --> 49:57.363
This is Kurtwell. Hello, Lenny.

49:58.621 --> 50:01.408
Even though you let it ring and ring,
/ know you were waiting for my call.

50:03.126 --> 50:07.620
Do you really want me to come to Rome
and be subjected to a trial and found guilty?

50:07.714 --> 50:09.796
I'm afraid it's absolutely necessary.

50:12.510 --> 50:14.501
Then one second afterl land in Rome,

50:15.763 --> 50:19.096
you're gonna see all the things I have on you
in all the newspapers of the world.

50:20.935 --> 50:23.142
Go right ahead.

50:23.229 --> 50:24.765
The world will probably like it.

50:59.265 --> 51:01.927
This is Archbishop Kurtwell.
Is this a bad time?

51:03.311 --> 51:04.892
That depends.

51:04.979 --> 51:09.348
l have some conﬁdential
information about the Pope.

51:09.442 --> 51:10.978
And / have proof.

51:11.069 --> 51:13.811
To be perfectly frank,
it’s more than information.

51:13.905 --> 51:17.068
These are ticking time bombs.

51:17.158 --> 51:20.321
In that case, this is a very good time.

51:20.411 --> 51:21.821
Especially for a journalist.

51:21.913 --> 51:23.278
What's the subject?

51:24.290 --> 51:25.666
I’m not talking about it on the phone.

51:45.728 --> 51:48.105
You see the kind of thing
we're talking about here?

51:48.189 --> 51:52.728
Letters that our Pope wrote
to his California girlfriend over the years.

51:54.028 --> 51:56.770
We have a Pope with
a very active emotional life.

52:00.660 --> 52:01.775
Where did you find them?

52:02.203 --> 52:06.412
I took over a position
that was previously held by Belardo.

52:06.499 --> 52:07.705
I took over his desk.

52:08.376 --> 52:12.460
Belardo made the error of leaving these letters
at the back of a drawer.

52:14.674 --> 52:16.130
Did you read them all?

52:16.217 --> 52:18.503
Only the pertinent passages.

52:18.594 --> 52:20.971
The steamier ones are the ones that prove

52:22.807 --> 52:25.549
that Belardo has had a woman for years.

52:27.437 --> 52:30.224
You should have read them all and with care.

52:32.066 --> 52:33.806
In this last one, he states

52:33.901 --> 52:37.143
that he'll never send
these letters to that woman

52:37.238 --> 52:38.899
because he's married to God.

52:40.199 --> 52:42.155
Do you have any evidence
that they were ever mailed?

52:42.243 --> 52:45.235
Any envelopes with canceled stamps?

52:45.580 --> 52:46.740
No.

52:48.249 --> 52:49.329
No, I don't.

52:53.504 --> 52:56.541
Well, in that case,
my good Archbishop Kurtwell,

52:56.632 --> 52:58.088
you don't have any news for me.

52:59.385 --> 53:01.626
No bomb, no scandal.

53:01.763 --> 53:04.755
A stack of love letters that
were never mailed isn't news.

53:05.767 --> 53:07.428
It's strictly literature.

53:35.797 --> 53:38.004

The Cardinal Secretary of State
accepted my request.

53:44.722 --> 53:46.804
We are going to take the train to the airport.

53:52.146 --> 53:53.397
On one condition.

53:55.316 --> 53:56.476
What condition?

53:58.027 --> 54:00.234
That we sit in the last car in the train.
