11:14.273 --> 11:16.508
Uh, worse than being
at a dance club

11:16.510 --> 11:18.576
that has a price club?

11:18.578 --> 11:22.047
Max black in the house of grain.

11:24.116 --> 11:25.984
And now he saw me.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.119
Well, I'm gonna go hide
before she sees me.

11:28.121 --> 11:31.322
I'll be in tom's shoes.
Nobody's ever over there.

11:34.460 --> 11:38.363
I'm bustin' out some free range
electronic dance music.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.297
That's right!

11:39.299 --> 11:41.533
I'm bringing it
in my own bag.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.502
¶ ¶

11:44.504 --> 11:45.804
uh, okay, we good?

11:45.806 --> 11:47.072
See you next Tuesday.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.274
Come on, stay.
What's your hurry?

11:49.276 --> 11:52.744
I can't watch any more people
dance-shop.

11:52.746 --> 11:53.878
Max, come on.
Get in front of me.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.313
See what you can do.

11:55.315 --> 11:59.084
Oh, you're behind me
this time--that's new.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.652
All right,
everybody,

12:00.654 --> 12:03.888
frisee, 'cause we got
a special guest dj

12:03.890 --> 12:05.156
in the hizzay

12:05.158 --> 12:08.293
who's so hot
it's radicchio.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.696
Go on.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.898
Bob, I'd like to bid $1.00.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.334
$1.00, Bob, $1.00.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.970
Have your pets
spayed or neutered.

12:18.972 --> 12:22.407
Speaking of neutered pets,
here comes han.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.410
Still counts
as a dj shout-out.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.445
Hey,
why wait till Tuesday?

12:27.447 --> 12:30.215
Why don't I take a break
and we can go in the back.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.350
I just need to find someone
to cover me.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.453
Someone bogarted
all the nut butter.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.457
How about half of someone?

12:49.301 --> 12:50.969
Can I help you, miss?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.403
Max?

12:52.405 --> 12:54.072
What are you doing?

12:54.074 --> 12:57.242
I'm thirsty, broke, and they
cut me off at the free lemonade.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.543
What are you doing?

12:58.545 --> 13:00.178
Well, two dudes
were getting it on

13:00.180 --> 13:02.947
in the family restroom, so...

13:02.949 --> 13:04.649
Where's Sebastian?

13:04.651 --> 13:05.450
Who?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.552
Oh, milk.
Bottom shelf.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.690
What's up?

13:15.828 --> 13:18.396
You're not doing it
in the dairy case!

13:18.398 --> 13:22.133
Uh, no I'm not,
'cause you won't go away.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.702
Do you have to ruin sex
everywhere?

13:24.704 --> 13:27.405
Well, Max,
if I wasn't lactose intolerant

13:27.407 --> 13:30.375
before, I am now.

13:31.710 --> 13:35.313
Oh, my god,
Caroline Channing!

13:35.315 --> 13:37.882
Hi!
It's hilary waldare.

13:37.884 --> 13:40.718
Oh, my god! Hi!
- Hi!

13:40.720 --> 13:43.388
I haven't seen you
since your party.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.691
Someone said you left crying.
How are you?

13:46.693 --> 13:49.794
I'm great! I mean,
I'm shopping at whole foods,

13:49.796 --> 13:53.064
buying some organic fuel
that I'll probably take

13:53.066 --> 13:57.135
a couple sips of in spin class
and then throw away, so...

13:57.137 --> 13:59.737
Oh, good, 'cause I heard
you were still poor

13:59.739 --> 14:02.707
and that you were working
as a waitress.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.876
A waitress?

14:04.878 --> 14:06.744
That is insane.

14:06.746 --> 14:12.016
That is so insane it should be
in an ice tub in an asylum.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.953
I'm so glad you're great,
because when I saw you

14:14.955 --> 14:19.824
in those three-year-old
Louboutins, I got worried.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.460
Also, you have
an orange juice mustache.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.835
Oh. Where's Max?

14:30.837 --> 14:32.403
Milk.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.673
Max, listen--
- busy!

14:35.675 --> 14:37.675
Hilary's still here.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.011
And she called me a waitress.
How dare her.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.380
She humiliated me,
and I didn't even get

14:42.382 --> 14:45.783
a party this time.
I'm going home.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.753
(Store manager)
Hilary waldare, report
to register three.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.788
Oh, my god!
Did he just say--

14:50.790 --> 14:53.291
(store manager)
Hilary waldare.
Register three.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.260
He did!
Oh, my god! Max!

14:55.262 --> 14:56.761
Busy!

14:58.297 --> 15:00.164
What?
Do you wanna just join us?

15:00.166 --> 15:04.302
Hilary waldare works here,
as a cashier!

15:04.304 --> 15:05.703
So I win!

15:05.705 --> 15:07.939
Everyone knows on the job
humiliation chain,

15:07.941 --> 15:11.976
it goes:
Prostitute, hostess, waitress,

15:11.978 --> 15:15.847
cashier, Princess Jasmine in the
Disney electric light parade.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.482
What happened
to not looking down

15:17.484 --> 15:20.051
on other people
with crappy jobs?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.653
Oh please, this is real.

15:21.655 --> 15:24.822
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have got $14

15:24.824 --> 15:26.624
burning a second hole
in my pocket,

15:26.626 --> 15:29.427
and I'm gonna spend it here
at register three.

15:30.462 --> 15:33.398
[Sebastian moans]

15:33.400 --> 15:34.866
Whoo!

15:34.868 --> 15:38.069
What, you couldn't wait for me?

15:48.781 --> 15:51.115
This goes out to Kelly
in prepared foods.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.784
The Kelly with the cystic acne,

15:52.786 --> 15:56.287
not the Kelly
with the bald spot.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.490
Now, where my Adele-heads at?

16:02.328 --> 16:05.129
I'm glad you have no line,
'cause I have an exclusive

16:05.131 --> 16:06.397
private yoga class to get to--

16:06.399 --> 16:09.100
oh, hilary!

16:09.102 --> 16:10.401
Yes, Caroline.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.437
I am a cashier.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.205
I'm sorry, a what?

16:14.207 --> 16:16.040
I'm a cashier.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.977
Yeah, turns out things
aren't great.

16:18.979 --> 16:22.513
My husband left me
for my dad.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.316
And they didn't even cut me
in on the lifetime movie rights.

16:25.318 --> 16:30.221
It's on in January--
<i>father is the bride.</i>

16:30.223 --> 16:32.090
Let me just weigh your salad.

16:32.092 --> 16:35.026
Well, I'm sure you'll pull
yourself together like I did.

16:35.028 --> 16:38.596
'Cause I'm kind of killing it,
life-wise.

16:38.598 --> 16:42.233
That'll be $28.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.469
There's only $14 here.

16:44.471 --> 16:47.872
$28 for a salad?

16:47.874 --> 16:50.508
Well, that's dinosaur Kale.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.976
Oh! Mistake.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.778
Didn't want the dinosaur Kale.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.947
Never liked dinosaurs
and really don't like them

16:55.949 --> 16:57.448
in my Kale.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.484
Dinosaur Kale gone.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.553
You're just putting it
on the counter?

17:04.823 --> 17:06.257
Oh, I don't usually shop
for myself.

17:06.259 --> 17:09.560
Is that not how it's done?

17:09.562 --> 17:13.531
Caroline, do you not have
enough money?

17:14.666 --> 17:18.870
No, hilary,
I have enough money.

17:18.872 --> 17:23.041
I just don't know why
I have so many eggs.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.213
Here. You're holding up
the line.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.782
You obviously don't have
enough money

17:30.784 --> 17:33.584
to pay for your salad.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.053
Sad.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.255
I don't know what
you're implying.

17:37.257 --> 17:41.059
Oh! Here is my very successful
business partner.

17:41.061 --> 17:44.095
Sorry it took so long.
I couldn't find my pants.

17:44.097 --> 17:47.865
I don't know how they made it
all the way to the loading dock.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.967
Face it Caroline,
you came here to humiliate me

17:49.969 --> 17:52.003
and you can't even afford
that egg.

17:52.005 --> 17:54.739
On your face.

17:54.741 --> 17:59.610
Miss, did you drop
this $20 bill?

17:59.612 --> 18:01.779
Yes! Yes I did!

18:01.781 --> 18:04.148
I dropped some money,
too.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.451
don't push it.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.685
Thank you, sir.
This is very kind of you

18:07.687 --> 18:09.921
and I really appreciate it.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.656
Anything for my favorite
waitress.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.957
[Gasps]

18:12.959 --> 18:17.328
Oh, I knew you were
a waitress.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.931
Your store
sucks!

18:19.933 --> 18:22.767
I just had sex
in your dairy department.

18:24.503 --> 18:25.703
Keep the change.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.139
And buy your dad-husband
a wedding gift.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.050
Okay, one more time.

18:39.052 --> 18:42.053
Ouija,
should I be with Oleg?

18:44.823 --> 18:46.924
15 out of 15 yeses.

18:46.926 --> 18:50.194
That's still unclear.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.362
Sophie, this is silly.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.664
You know you two wanna
get back together.

18:53.666 --> 18:57.301
Caroline, we already have
the ouija board.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.670
We don't need another thing
around here that's flat

18:59.672 --> 19:03.508
and wrong all the time.

19:03.510 --> 19:08.579
Fine. Sophie, if it's not me,
after all I've offered you, go.

19:08.581 --> 19:13.317
Ask the spirits who the man
you are supposed to be with is.

19:13.319 --> 19:18.089
Ouija, please spell out
the name of the man

19:18.091 --> 19:21.726
that I'm supposed to be with.

19:21.728 --> 19:24.795
Oh, look, it's moving.

19:24.797 --> 19:30.334
"V," "a," "n,"--

19:30.336 --> 19:34.105
this is what the world
was like before the Internet.

19:34.107 --> 19:38.176
"K," "o."

19:38.178 --> 19:39.644
"Vanko."

19:39.646 --> 19:42.113
Vanko?
Yeah, that sounds cute.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.248
Yeah, I like it--
I'm sorry, Oleg.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.983
The spirits have spoken.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.853
I'm supposed to be with someone
named vanko.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.988
And they know the best.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.758
So you're supposed to be with
someone named vanko?

19:53.760 --> 19:56.694
Mm-hmm.

20:02.701 --> 20:07.905
"Vanko Oleg golishevsky"?

20:10.008 --> 20:12.643
I go by my middle name
'cause there were seven other

20:12.645 --> 20:16.581
vankos in my family.

20:16.583 --> 20:20.518
But I didn't even know that.

20:20.520 --> 20:24.155
Yeah, that means the ouija is--

20:24.157 --> 20:26.824
oh, uh...

20:26.826 --> 20:30.061
Ohh...Yeah...

20:30.063 --> 20:32.930
Oh, no, no, vanko.
No!

20:32.932 --> 20:34.865
I--
no, I--

20:34.867 --> 20:37.368
we can--you and I can get back
together, okay?

20:37.370 --> 20:40.504
But I just can't be here
right now.

20:40.506 --> 20:43.207
No, I mean,
this is just too damn spooky!

20:43.209 --> 20:45.042
[Shrieks]

20:47.145 --> 20:48.746
I can't wait
to tell my brothers,

20:48.748 --> 20:51.082
vanko and vanko,
about this.

20:52.451 --> 20:54.552
Ah, ah, ah...

20:54.554 --> 20:58.456
Word on the street is
you've been talking some smack

20:58.458 --> 21:00.391
about cashiers.
