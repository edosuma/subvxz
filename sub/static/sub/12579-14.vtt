00:32.232 --> 00:35.258
DALE: Exterminator's log, 0:10:05 a.m.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.133
Rat infestation at the Nickman residence.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.241
This where you saw him last, Nickman?

00:42.342 --> 00:45.106
Yes, sir. He was underneath that cabinet.

00:47.681 --> 00:51.447
You see, unlike the human,
the rat drags his testes as he walks.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.611
This creates a urine trail.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.648
[Detector buzzing]

00:58.125 --> 00:59.956
Male testes confirmed.

01:09.369 --> 01:12.429
- Shouldn't you be wearing a mask?
- Mask, smask.

01:12.539 --> 01:15.508
Smask. Sh... mask.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.471
Shmask. Mask, shmask.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.740
That's it. Mask, shmask.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.172
[Breathing heavily]

01:53.814 --> 01:54.781
[Exclaims]

01:55.983 --> 01:56.950
[Dale chuckles]

01:58.185 --> 02:01.245
You've peed in your last old man's kitchen.

02:04.992 --> 02:05.959
[Gasps]

02:14.535 --> 02:16.435
DALE: Nickman?
HANK: It's Hank.

02:16.904 --> 02:21.034
They called me because, apparently,
I'm your emergency contact person.

02:21.408 --> 02:24.900
I wanted someone who had nothing
to gain from my demise.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.074
Good. I'm glad you're awake.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.616
Mr. Gribble,
22 years of breathing in toxins...

02:30.717 --> 02:33.345
have eroded your sinuses
and coated your lungs...

02:33.453 --> 02:35.648
with a substance I can't quite identify.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.987
I would like that substance back.
It belongs to me.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.217
[Sighs]

02:40.327 --> 02:43.922
Look, Dale, the doctor thinks
you should quit exterminating.

02:44.031 --> 02:47.194
- Your body can't handle any more poisons.
- Can, too.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.462
If you don't quit, you won't live to 50.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.198
Of course, I'm rounding that number up.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.068
Well, that was a waste of time.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.699
Don't tell Nancy what he said.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.176
She'd wanna listen to this clown.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.071
I already called her.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.082
She had to stop at home
to get your real IDs.

03:04.551 --> 03:07.179
That was a bad, bad move, Hank.

03:08.755 --> 03:10.985
She's here, too? That's it.

03:11.224 --> 03:15.126
Hank, you are hereby relieved
of your duties as my emergency person.

03:15.262 --> 03:16.661
Peggy, you're in.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.663
You will not regret it.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.935
Nancy, did you borrow
my rat-urine detector?

03:24.171 --> 03:27.629
I donated it to charity.
You're too sick to exterminate, sug'.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.209
I'll tell you what I told that doctor:

03:30.310 --> 03:33.108
"I'm not quitting, you incompetent quack."

03:33.647 --> 03:35.410
I love exterminating.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.607
- More than you love me?
- No.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.317
Pretty close, though.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.718
Dale, you have a family who needs you.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.986
- And I need to work to support them.
- I support us.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.691
- But I contribute.
- You pay the cable bill.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.759
Come on, sug', if not for me,
then for Joseph.

03:52.866 --> 03:56.666
What about your dream
to see your son take his son to Roswell?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.561
That rang true.

04:00.574 --> 04:04.943
Well, if you need me, I'll be 8 feet
under in my metaphorical grave.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.408
The basement.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.209
Damn, I was good.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.120
[Door opens]

04:17.290 --> 04:21.420
Dad, I just came down to borrow
some roaches for my science project.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.497
Roaches have been on this earth
for 500 million years.

04:25.599 --> 04:29.000
You've been here, what? 13?
You're in over your head.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.134
What species are these?

04:31.738 --> 04:34.002
Madagascar hissing cockroaches.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.074
[Hisses]

04:35.609 --> 04:36.906
Well done.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.909
All right, here's what we'll do
for your science project.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.312
We will breed servant roaches.

04:43.850 --> 04:47.047
As long as we ensure
that I'm the first thing the roaches see...

04:47.154 --> 04:49.714
when they are born,
they will think I am their mother...

04:49.823 --> 04:52.485
and will therefore obey
my every command.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.526
My every command.

04:55.162 --> 04:57.687
Think we can train them to crawl
through a maze?

04:57.798 --> 05:01.234
We'll train them to do worse things
than that, Joseph.

05:03.937 --> 05:04.904
[Gasps]

05:06.173 --> 05:07.538
NANCY: Oh, my Lord.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.599
Did it occur to either of you
to set the table for dinner?

05:11.712 --> 05:13.839
I guess we were distracted
by our afternoon...

05:13.947 --> 05:15.938
of monitoring roach excretia.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.108
That's how you spend your days?

05:18.218 --> 05:21.119
Who ate all the chopped meat?
That was dinner.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.586
The roaches.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.157
Excretia doesn't come from nowhere.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.522
Guess who I saw at the Mega Lo Mart?

05:31.631 --> 05:34.099
- Richie Sambora.
- No, you didn't.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.462
You weren't there.

05:37.037 --> 05:41.064
You know, Dale, we're all out here
to unwind from the work day.

05:41.208 --> 05:44.871
But the past few days,
you've, sort of, just been loitering.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.378
I've more pressures than any of you.

05:47.481 --> 05:51.178
You ever tried replacing
a cockroach's blood with root beer?

05:51.818 --> 05:54.582
- You know I haven't.
- Then don't judge me.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.952
Oh, my!

05:59.359 --> 06:03.295
All Dale does is eat, play with bugs,
and make prank phone calls.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.727
Do you know he called my office
three times today...

06:05.832 --> 06:08.130
trying to get me to change
my long-distance service?

06:08.235 --> 06:09.600
That was him?

06:09.703 --> 06:13.264
I'm tired of getting while-you-were-out
messages from the receptionist.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.069
"Husband called, still waiting for sex."

06:18.512 --> 06:22.539
Now, come May, I expect a Mother's Day
gift from you roaches.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.508
Word to the wise:

06:24.851 --> 06:27.843
Something you make yourselves
means even more.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.514
Hey, Dale. How are things with Nancy?

06:30.857 --> 06:32.791
You know, you used to...

06:33.226 --> 06:35.319
brag about... stuff.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.122
I didn't mean to brag.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.222
It's just that we were having
spectacular sex.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.567
Yeah, but not so much lately, huh?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.499
Maybe it's something I ate.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.507
What's the opposite of oysters? Apples?

06:49.810 --> 06:52.779
Look, maybe it has something to do
with you being out of work.

06:52.879 --> 06:56.337
I mean, would you want to
sleep with a bum?

06:57.217 --> 06:58.912
- No.
- That's right.

06:59.619 --> 07:03.749
See, there's nothing sexier than
a man with a nine-to-five job.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.691
Which is why I lined up a new job for you.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.260
Remember my cousin, Rita?

07:08.361 --> 07:10.921
- The one with the under bite?
- Yeah.

07:11.298 --> 07:14.563
Well, she just quit her job
at that adhesives company...

07:14.668 --> 07:17.432
and she's putting in a good word
for you to replace her.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.198
Well, I hope she puts it in writing...

07:19.306 --> 07:21.774
because you can barely
understand her when she talks.

07:26.379 --> 07:29.542
- My man looks so handsome.
- I know.

07:30.550 --> 07:34.213
And I type 30 words per minute.
Can we make out?

07:37.357 --> 07:39.917
Well, look at you in your suit.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.827
It's Joseph's.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.555
You didn't have to drive me to work.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.223
I wasn't gonna play hooky on my first day.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.267
Well, that's not what you told Bobby.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.928
Your boy's a liar and a blabbermouth.

07:54.908 --> 07:58.435
And, Dale, remember,
everyone likes a hard worker.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.611
Of course they do.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.944
They do all the work for them!

08:04.317 --> 08:05.341
Ass.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.657
Mr. Gribble, you're a minute late.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.364
No, my watch says 9:01.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.464
Oh, do you start at 9:00?

08:22.569 --> 08:24.332
Well, we're a team at Stik-Tek.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.531
And a team is only as strong
as its weakest player.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.972
That's you.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.472
We don't smoke here at Stik-Tek.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.484
I understand.
You have to tell everyone that.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.323
We don't allow sunglasses at Stik-Tek...

08:46.426 --> 08:49.088
unless you can prove that you're blind.

08:52.098 --> 08:56.194
Certainly no caps, except yarmulkes
under 8 inches in diameter.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.104
The cap stays.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.496
Not at Stik-Tek.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.277
You're bald.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.773
And not in an attractive way,
like Sean Connery.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.048
Oh, well, rules are rules.

09:16.389 --> 09:20.223
Here's your cubicle.
This is where you sit and work.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.255
Welcome to Stik-Tek.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.614
My little working man's up early today.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.384
They made me join a car pool...

09:51.491 --> 09:54.392
and it leaves early
because of all the stops.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.721
Well, maybe they can pick you up last.

09:57.831 --> 10:01.232
I tried that. Rodriguez is last.
Always has been.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.301
Dale, I know you're used to
being your own boss.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.964
But you've got to learn
how to work with humans.

10:07.073 --> 10:08.199
Humans?

10:08.308 --> 10:11.038
They won't even let me eat lunch
until 1:00.

10:11.144 --> 10:14.545
You know I like nine small meals
throughout the day.

10:15.582 --> 10:16.742
[Car horn honking]

10:17.717 --> 10:19.082
Not ready!

10:19.319 --> 10:20.718
Check this out.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.811
Something's going on between
Frank and Linda.

10:22.922 --> 10:26.551
I heard from that guy in Accounts Payable,
the one with the vintage glasses...

10:26.659 --> 10:29.628
that they were at Bennigan's
sharing mozzarella sticks.

10:30.697 --> 10:33.666
Enjoy the end of
The Today Show, Rodriguez?

10:34.067 --> 10:36.365
Not as much as the beginning of Regis.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.494
Hey, did you guys hear
about Frank and Linda?

10:39.606 --> 10:43.303
DALE: Invoice 1347/2. Amount $3.88.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.344
Check number 8429, cleared.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.243
Invoice number 1347/3.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.282
Amount $17.47.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.578
Check number 3524, cleared.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.375
Oh, God.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.184
Invoice 1347/4. Amount $6.19.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.691
Mr. Gribble, what did I tell you?

11:01.694 --> 11:05.460
- No hats of any kind at Stik-Tek.
- Thank you.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.658
One more slip-up and you lose
your privileges...

11:07.767 --> 11:10.167
to dress casual on casual Fridays.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.033
- Are we clear?
- Clear.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.168
Can I go to lunch now?

11:14.274 --> 11:16.265
I moved your lunch to 4:00.

11:16.376 --> 11:20.244
I need you to fill in for the receptionist.
She's eating lunch.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.912
I don't know if I can wait
for Dale any longer.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.453
BILL: I'm getting awfully chilly.
DALE: Up yours, Rodriguez.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.655
Hey, Dale, what's new
in the world of adhesives?

11:42.068 --> 11:46.698
Well, we were each issued
two Stik-Tek brand stick-it pads.

11:47.140 --> 11:50.940
Well, this is great. We're getting
the inside scoop here, fellas.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.638
I should tell you about Special Project F...

11:53.746 --> 11:57.443
adhesive strips for envelopes that come
in all different flavors.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.519
Mango, peach, lime, cherry...

12:00.854 --> 12:03.118
and maybe piña colada.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.523
Speaking purely as a consumer...

12:05.625 --> 12:08.685
I can't wait for that product
to hit the stores.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.858
- How about you, Boomhauer?
- Dang old...

12:12.866 --> 12:13.924
What?

12:14.267 --> 12:16.132
Yeah, man. You know...

12:17.904 --> 12:20.634
Dad, since you're spending
so much time at work...

12:20.740 --> 12:23.072
we'd better leave the roach tank
in your office.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.145
That way you'll still be the first thing
they see when they hatch.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.441
- And they'll think...
- Up yours, Joseph!

12:28.548 --> 12:30.846
- Dale.
- I'm sorry, son.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.942
That's the coffee talking,
and the fluorescent lighting.

12:34.053 --> 12:36.214
And the excruciating headache.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.688
Make some time for the roaches, sug'.

12:38.791 --> 12:41.555
We'd all love to make time for roaches.

12:41.661 --> 12:45.392
But in the real world, people have to
spend all night reconciling invoices...

12:45.498 --> 12:49.662
or Miss Pitman won't let them
wear chinos and a knit shirt next Friday!

12:51.971 --> 12:54.531
Dale, what are you doing to
the Bug-a-Bago?

12:54.641 --> 12:56.370
My turn to drive the car pool...

12:56.476 --> 12:59.411
and the underground
garage clearance is only 7 feet.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.343
Why don't you just take off her antennas?

13:01.447 --> 13:04.211
Why don't you just take off Bobby's head?

13:07.353 --> 13:08.980
I can't fire Bert.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.852
He and I started at Stik-Tek
at the same time...

13:11.958 --> 13:13.721
19 years ago.

13:13.993 --> 13:17.690
Well, I can't fire him.
We were married briefly in the '80s.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.656
Part of me still loves him.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.563
DALE: Whine, whine, whine.

13:21.668 --> 13:24.762
When I was an exterminator,
I killed living "isms."

13:24.871 --> 13:27.431
What's the big whoop
about firing someone?

13:27.540 --> 13:30.668
Mr. Gribble, you don't know
Bert Halverstrom, do you?

13:30.777 --> 13:33.678
Met him once. Didn't care for him much.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.977
Well, since you're about
the only one here...

13:36.082 --> 13:39.677
who has no personal attachment to Bert,
maybe you could do me a favor...

13:39.786 --> 13:41.117
Fire him?

13:41.221 --> 13:44.418
Throw in a container of milk
and we have ourselves a deal.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.519
Good-looking kids for two ugly people.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.526
I was expecting Miss Pitman. Amy.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.157
Yeah, she asked me to talk to you instead.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.667
Aren't you the receptionist?

13:56.769 --> 13:59.761
When Judy eats lunch.
But that's not important.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.507
What is important is
that you've got 30 seconds...

14:02.609 --> 14:05.305
to tell me why you should keep your job.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.373
Well, I...

14:07.614 --> 14:09.775
Yeah, that's not going to fly.

14:09.882 --> 14:12.248
Sorry, Halverstrom. You're fired.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.319
[Gasps]

14:13.620 --> 14:16.282
Bert, I just heard. I'm so sorry.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.421
That was very decisive.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.823
Listen, there's someone else I need to fire.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.829
This person I hate so much,
I can't even look at him.

14:24.931 --> 14:26.057
You know the price.

14:27.267 --> 14:30.100
- It's all over, Gladstone.
- Excuse me?

14:30.470 --> 14:33.064
Pack your stuff and get out
by the end of the day.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.969
I can see why you don't like him.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.008
What about my health insurance?

14:37.110 --> 14:40.568
- Miss Pitman?
- I fought for you, Sal. Honestly.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.480
Anyone else? I'm still thirsty.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.783
Mr. Gribble, how would you like to
make this your permanent job?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.551
Firing Gladstone? Sure. Gladstone!

14:52.659 --> 14:53.956
No.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.327
Look, nobody knows this...

14:56.429 --> 14:59.921
but Dallas is downsizing
the flavored adhesive division.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.968
Piña colada was killing lab monkeys
left and right.

15:04.971 --> 15:07.337
What a day.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.073
Car pool had to stop at the store.
Rodriguez needed a comb.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.201
Oh, yeah.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.839
They made me Assistant Vice President
of Human Resources.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.384
My husband is an assistant vice president?

15:19.886 --> 15:22.081
I am so proud of you.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.152
What're you doing?

15:30.797 --> 15:32.992
I heard Mitch got eighty-sixed, too.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.124
Yeah, at his own damn birthday party.

15:35.234 --> 15:38.965
Gribble walked in, blew out the candles,
told him to leave the cake and get out.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.165
All of these plants are real...

15:41.274 --> 15:44.539
and give off oxygen
which I use throughout the day.

15:46.546 --> 15:50.243
By my count, that's six outlets, Dale,
all of them grounded.

15:50.516 --> 15:53.644
NANCY: Here's a photo of me for your
new, big, fancy desk.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.247
We could move it
if we ever wanted to... you know.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.725
Have sex on the desk? Sure.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.418
We could even move the roaches.

16:01.527 --> 16:03.290
I'll just have to find a new place...

16:03.396 --> 16:06.729
to keep my keys
to the executive washroom.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.794
- Who has to make?
- Why, I could go.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.299
You're not an executive.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.204
Hold it in until we get to the restaurant.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.000
How could I have forgotten?

16:18.111 --> 16:21.842
- Lewis, could you come in here for a sec?
- Yes, Mr. Gribble.

16:22.415 --> 16:26.476
Lewis, now, you've been with Stik-Tek
for how long?

16:27.086 --> 16:30.078
- It'll be 14 years next week.
- No, it won't.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.894
You're fired.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.462
[All gasp]

16:38.197 --> 16:40.631
- Fired? But...
- Yeah, listen.

16:40.733 --> 16:44.225
I'm hungry, she has to pee,
and he has to get back to work...

16:44.337 --> 16:46.430
or he'll end up in the same boat as you.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.905
But I've got four children.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.101
I had someone earlier today with eight.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.976
Heck, I once killed a beetle
with 30 million in her egg sac.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.048
[Sobs]

16:56.282 --> 16:58.113
Well, who wants steak?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.046
DALE: Sh-sh-shah to you!

17:05.157 --> 17:08.650
That guy you fired today,
the way he was crying...

17:08.861 --> 17:09.885
I said sh-sh-shah.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.987
...I just can't get that image
out of my head.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.165
Then let me replace it with this image.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.365
[Humming]

17:33.186 --> 17:37.179
- Sorry, sug'. I just don't feel like it.
- Maybe this'll help.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.629
Rodriguez, if you ever want your kids...

17:49.735 --> 17:52.829
to see you lose another sack race
at the company picnic...

17:52.939 --> 17:56.397
I suggest you get your butt
in the back seat.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.807
Excuse me.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.438
[Chuckles smugly]

18:03.115 --> 18:04.207
Thought so.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.679
Carl...

18:06.786 --> 18:09.482
as a janitor, what would you do...

18:09.789 --> 18:12.952
with unlimited free time and no income?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.621
- Sug'?
- Busy, Nancy.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.920
Joseph, also busy.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.828
But, Dad, my science project's
due tomorrow.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.491
I need my roaches.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.399
They should've hatched by now.

18:24.504 --> 18:28.565
They're in the bottom drawer of my desk
next to Carl's severance check.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.733
Now, if you'll excuse us...

18:30.843 --> 18:33.334
They've escaped. We gotta find them.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.311
You people with your roaches.

18:35.414 --> 18:38.679
I'm trying to fire this incompetent fool
with compassion.

18:38.784 --> 18:39.773
But, Dad!

18:39.886 --> 18:42.980
You keep this up, Joseph,
you're fired from this family.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.614
- Dale.
- You're next, Blondie.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.921
Carl, I'm off to round up some roaches.

18:49.028 --> 18:52.930
Any one of which would have made
a better janitor than you.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.839
People, we have a small insect situation.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.272
Please remain... Veronica, you're fired...

19:03.376 --> 19:05.469
calm and enjoy your lunch.

19:08.447 --> 19:09.607
[All screaming]

19:10.016 --> 19:11.244
Look out!

19:13.252 --> 19:17.154
Remain calm, everyone. I am their mother.

19:17.890 --> 19:21.291
Line up single file and get back in the tank.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.083
[Screams]

19:23.195 --> 19:26.096
They're not recognizing me
as their maternal influence.

19:26.198 --> 19:28.598
The project has gone horribly awry.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.067
Quick, Joseph, get me some real poison.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.162
But, Dad, you're not supposed
to inhale any more poison.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.798
Damn it, why are there so many ways
to kill people...

19:36.909 --> 19:39.002
but only one way to kill bugs?

19:39.111 --> 19:40.738
Hold that thought.

19:42.548 --> 19:43.776
[Grunts]

19:45.651 --> 19:46.618
[Dale chuckles]

19:53.526 --> 19:54.493
[Dale grunts]

19:58.264 --> 19:59.231
[Grunting]

20:17.249 --> 20:18.216
[Grunting]

20:21.120 --> 20:22.087
[Yells]

20:22.488 --> 20:23.455
[Gasps]

20:27.360 --> 20:28.827
Turbine!

20:30.663 --> 20:32.392
[Rumbling]

20:33.566 --> 20:34.897
[Dale screaming]

20:36.769 --> 20:38.566
Sh-sh-sha!

20:39.605 --> 20:41.573
The roaches are dead.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.835
Please return to your lunch.

20:45.544 --> 20:46.670
Enjoy.

20:47.613 --> 20:48.580
Wow.

20:48.814 --> 20:52.375
You killed them all.
And you didn't even use poison.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.916
Yeah, I did. And I didn't, did I?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.519
I don't need that toxic crutch.

20:58.624 --> 21:02.458
All I need is Dale Gribble,
the exterminator.

21:02.895 --> 21:06.558
Pitman, firing people can give you
a pretty good buzz...

21:06.699 --> 21:09.964
but it's a poor, poor substitute for killing.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.538
- I realize that now.
- Dale, please.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.476
You were the best human resources
manager Stik-Tek ever had.

21:17.576 --> 21:20.340
And I'm going all the way back to
when we were Stik Co.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.904
Sorry, Miss Pitman,
I've got some love to give.

21:25.384 --> 21:27.215
And some love to make.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.992
MISS PITMAN: Mr. Gribble.

21:45.705 --> 21:49.072
DALE: Good news, Joseph.
You can have your suit back.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.376
DALE: Maybe this'll help.
