This might be
a bad time to go off
on your retreat, Master.

01:09.136 --> 01:13.138
There is never a bad time
to want to go off
in the wilderness

01:13.140 --> 01:15.773
and commune with
the oneness of the universe.

01:15.775 --> 01:17.475
But what
if Shredder and Krang

01:17.477 --> 01:20.178
pull another of their crazy
schemes while you're away?

01:20.180 --> 01:24.115
I feel certain that
your ninja training
will see you through.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.784
I sure hope you're right.

01:26.786 --> 01:30.421
<i>And so, the message</i>
<i>of this special report</i>
<i>on world hunger</i>

01:30.423 --> 01:32.323
<i>is that we all</i>
<i>must do our part</i>

01:32.325 --> 01:34.525
<i>to feed the hungry</i>
<i>citizens of our planet.</i>

01:34.527 --> 01:37.128
<i>This is April O'Neal</i>
<i>signing off.</i>

01:37.130 --> 01:38.362
Man, I don't get it.

01:38.364 --> 01:39.597
We can put
a rocket on the moon,

01:39.599 --> 01:41.800
but we can't put food
on everyone's table.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.568
Take a number, amigo.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.336
Scientist dudes
have been working

01:45.338 --> 01:47.271
on that problemo
for years.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.508
Yeah, well maybe it's time
our resident genius
took a whack at it.

01:50.510 --> 01:53.211
Yeah! Maybe I can
invent something

01:53.213 --> 01:55.246
that would help solve
the world hunger problem.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.849
I'll get to work
on it right now.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.585
Well, try to finish it
before lunch, would you?

02:00.587 --> 02:03.487
You can only keep a pizza
warm for just so long.

02:11.797 --> 02:12.997
Blast it!

02:12.999 --> 02:15.366
Now where are those
two lame brain mutants?

02:21.741 --> 02:24.141
Whoa!

02:25.945 --> 02:29.614
You clumsy louts.
Can't you do
anything right?

02:29.616 --> 02:32.684
Well, I thought
we screamed pretty good.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.053
Just take care
of those guards.

02:35.055 --> 02:38.390
Sneaking up on people
and fighting dirty.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.025
Now, that I like.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.092
[yelling]

02:44.931 --> 02:46.364
Hey, boss,

02:46.366 --> 02:49.868
what's Krang gonna do
with all of these balloons?

02:49.870 --> 02:53.872
Ooh, ooh, maybe
he's gonna blow 'em up
and have a party.

02:53.874 --> 02:57.075
Those are weather balloons,
you wet brains.

03:01.013 --> 03:02.213
Aah!

03:04.617 --> 03:06.451
You razor-brained
klutzes!

03:06.453 --> 03:08.553
You're throwing
our plans off schedule.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.488
Now, load up
the rest of those tanks

03:10.490 --> 03:12.958
and bring them
to the Technodrome.

03:17.930 --> 03:21.600
Gentlemen, prepare
to be astounded.

03:21.602 --> 03:26.070
Behold my contribution
to the problem of world hunger.

03:26.072 --> 03:27.071
Ta-da!

03:27.073 --> 03:29.907
The food revivifier!

03:29.909 --> 03:32.143
Like, what's it do, dude?

03:32.145 --> 03:35.146
Observe these soggy,
overripe bananas.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.881
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!

03:36.883 --> 03:41.953
And now, a single jolt
of the revivifier ray, and...

03:41.955 --> 03:44.789
That's amazing!
They turned yellow again.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.958
Sure, but how
do they taste?

03:46.960 --> 03:49.160
Well, the proof
is in the eating.

03:53.699 --> 03:56.267
Hey-hey, you made
a believer out of me.

03:56.269 --> 04:01.605
Well, as you see,
my revivifier reverses
the aging process of food.

04:01.607 --> 04:03.041
Oh, wow.

04:03.043 --> 04:06.778
That invention could
help solve the world
hunger problem.

04:06.780 --> 04:11.182
Don't go away, dudes.
It could also solve
another food problem.

04:11.184 --> 04:14.519
I found this week-old slice
of pizza behind the couch.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.654
Could you, like,
make it fresh again?

04:16.656 --> 04:18.322
Oh, really, Michelangelo,

04:18.325 --> 04:21.091
I've got more important
things to think about.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.960
Wrong, compadre.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.730
There's nothing more important
than thinking about pizza.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.668
[Donatello]
No, no, wait! Stop!

04:31.637 --> 04:33.571
Oh, you've bombarded us

04:33.573 --> 04:35.273
with the revivifying ray.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.675
Do you realize
what this means?

04:37.677 --> 04:40.845
Uh, if it's about us
turning yellow and
waiting to be peeled,

04:40.847 --> 04:42.747
I don't think I want to know.

04:42.749 --> 04:45.917
Chill, Raphael.
You're not food,
you're a turtle.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.685
Yeah, that's the trouble.

04:47.687 --> 04:51.322
I'm not sure
what effect it might have
on our reptilian bodies.

04:51.324 --> 04:53.424
[both gulp] Uh-oh.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.495
<i>April, this is Burne.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

04:58.497 --> 05:00.165
I'm at Fifth and Main, chief.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.300
<i>Get over to</i>
<i>the government</i>
<i>weather station.</i>

05:02.302 --> 05:03.701
<i>There's been a break-in.</i>

05:03.703 --> 05:06.537
<i>Dozens of tanks of helium</i>
<i>have been stolen,</i>

05:06.539 --> 05:09.040
<i>along with a crate filled</i>
<i>with weather balloons.</i>

05:09.042 --> 05:10.574
I'm on my way.

05:12.111 --> 05:13.544
Shredder, how could you?

05:13.546 --> 05:18.316
Leaving Rocksteady
and Bebop alone
on the surface?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.151
As they say on
the surface, Krang,

05:20.153 --> 05:21.852
don't blow a gasket!

05:21.854 --> 05:23.521
They'll return with
the equipment on schedule.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.688
You'll see.

05:24.690 --> 05:27.358
Well, they'd better
for your sake!

05:27.360 --> 05:30.895
If those two
bumbling cretins
spoil my plan,

05:30.897 --> 05:33.965
you're gonna
pay for it big time!

05:33.967 --> 05:37.868
I never realized
how purple picks up
the lavender in your eyes.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.437
Oh, thank you. Do you--

05:39.439 --> 05:41.172
Ooh!

05:42.341 --> 05:43.808
What's going on?

05:43.810 --> 05:46.410
[voices getting higher]
Look at me. I'm shrinking!

05:46.412 --> 05:49.413
Me, too,
and listen to my voice!

05:49.415 --> 05:52.516
I sound just like
a little turtle.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.852
This is all your fault,
Michelangelo .

05:54.854 --> 05:57.755
I warned you not to touch
that revivifier,

05:57.757 --> 06:00.825
and now we're getting
younger and younger!

06:00.827 --> 06:02.526
I said I was sorry.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.796
What do you want,
a letter of apology?

06:04.798 --> 06:08.133
A lot of good that'll do.
We can't even read yet.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.767
Yeah, you big bully.

06:09.769 --> 06:12.737
I'm gonna tell
Master Splinter on you.

06:12.739 --> 06:14.605
I don't wanna be little!

06:14.607 --> 06:16.107
Waah!

06:16.109 --> 06:19.477
Kids. There's
just no pleasing them.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.246
[beeps]

06:21.248 --> 06:22.447
The TurtleCom!

06:22.449 --> 06:24.249
That can only be one person.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.484
Yo, April,
what's doing, dudette?

06:26.486 --> 06:28.853
<i>There's been</i>
<i>a break-in at</i>
<i>the weather station.</i>

06:28.855 --> 06:30.754
You guys better
get down there
and check it out.

06:30.756 --> 06:32.356
I'll bet it's Shredder.

06:32.358 --> 06:34.592
What a time
for him to show up.

06:34.594 --> 06:38.329
Oh, boy! We want
to go and beat up
mean old Mr. Shredder.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.065
Oh, yeah!
I like beating up
that big bully.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.536
Don't you worry,
Auntie April,

06:44.538 --> 06:46.070
we're on our way.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.906
Come on, turtles,
let's have some neato fun

06:48.908 --> 06:51.276
at the weather station!

06:51.278 --> 06:52.877
[all shouting]

06:52.879 --> 06:56.080
No, dudes, wait!
Come back!

06:56.082 --> 06:58.115
<i>Auntie April?</i>

06:59.785 --> 07:02.753
Oh, boy,
this is gonna be fun.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.590
Yeah, we'll find
that mean old Shredder
and punch him in the nose!

07:06.592 --> 07:08.726
Yeah, neato!

07:08.728 --> 07:13.397
Dudes, it's too dangerous!
You're too small
to take on Shredder.

07:13.399 --> 07:15.233
Move it, mister.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.202
Whee!

07:17.204 --> 07:19.437
Wait, micro-dudes!

07:23.808 --> 07:26.844
Hey, hey, look,
it's Auntie April!

07:26.846 --> 07:29.747
Yoo-hoo, Auntie April!

07:29.749 --> 07:32.350
We're gonna punch
Shredder in the nose.

07:32.352 --> 07:36.087
It's the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles,

07:36.089 --> 07:39.690
only they've turned
into the 5-year-old
Mutant Ninja Turtles.

07:39.692 --> 07:42.226
Oh, no!

07:44.000 --> 07:50.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

07:51.036 --> 07:54.972
Okay, we got
all them helium tanks
in the module.

07:54.974 --> 07:58.576
Um, good.
Let's take 'em back
to the Technodrome.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.944
[Leonardo]
Look, you guys,
it's those big meanies!

08:00.946 --> 08:02.846
[Raphael]
Hee hee hee!
Let's get 'em!

08:02.848 --> 08:06.317
Come on and fight,
you big bird brains!

08:06.319 --> 08:08.186
We're not afraid of you!

08:08.188 --> 08:11.088
Heh,
I don't believe it.

08:11.090 --> 08:15.193
The turtles went
and shrunk back
to little kids.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.928
It's like a dream come true.

08:19.264 --> 08:21.666
Yeah, I just love

08:21.668 --> 08:24.702
beating up someone
smaller than me.

08:24.704 --> 08:27.538
Say nighty-night,
little turtle.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.207
I'm gonna punch out
your lights.

08:30.209 --> 08:34.912
All right, spud, try picking
on someone your own size.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.948
Well, let's take care
of the big one first.

08:40.751 --> 08:42.986
Hey! watch it!

08:42.989 --> 08:46.156
Hey, look, he's doing
the Turtle Trot!

08:48.394 --> 08:52.029
Hey, you big bullies,
quit picking on
our big brother.

08:53.231 --> 08:54.665
Whoa!
Whoa!

08:56.235 --> 08:59.070
That'll teach you
to play dirty tricks.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.538
That's it!

09:00.540 --> 09:03.708
I've had it up to
here with those brats.

09:05.577 --> 09:07.278
Quick, dudes, run!

09:09.147 --> 09:11.749
Oh, great. Dead end.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.817
Ha ha!

09:13.819 --> 09:15.753
When is this game
gonna be over?

09:15.755 --> 09:18.289
[gulp] Sooner than you think.

09:25.397 --> 09:27.364
Quick, fellas, hop aboard!

09:35.674 --> 09:39.109
Whoa, April, are we
happy to see you!

09:39.111 --> 09:41.679
We sure are,
Auntie April.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.782
We were gettin' tired
of that game.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.950
Great news, boss.

09:46.952 --> 09:50.921
Three of the turtles
have turned into
helpless little kids.

09:50.923 --> 09:51.955
<i>Excellent.</i>

09:51.957 --> 09:53.891
<i>Return to the Technodrome</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

09:53.893 --> 09:56.860
<i>It's time to put</i>
<i>those helium tanks to use.</i>

10:00.064 --> 10:02.065
[April]
Oh, what a day.

10:02.067 --> 10:05.670
I've never been
so exhausted in
my entire life.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.237
[Michelangelo]
Oh, for sure.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.673
Who'd have thought
three little tykes

10:08.675 --> 10:10.408
could take
so much out of you?

10:10.410 --> 10:13.344
Thank heavens for nap time.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.446
Well, listen, April,
I gotta split.

10:15.448 --> 10:19.416
Sure, stick me
with taking care of
them all by myself.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.085
I gotta go back to the lair

10:21.087 --> 10:22.586
and look through
Donatello's notes.

10:22.588 --> 10:26.090
Maybe there's an antidote
to his revivifier gizmo.

10:26.092 --> 10:29.060
And then I gotta
figure out what Shred-head

10:29.062 --> 10:31.162
and his mutant morons
are up to.

10:33.098 --> 10:34.098
Irma.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.700
I rushed over to warn you.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.334
Burne said if you're late

10:37.336 --> 10:39.003
filing the weather
station story,

10:39.005 --> 10:41.039
you'll be the late
April O'Neil

10:41.041 --> 10:43.040
Irma, I don't have
time to explain,

10:43.042 --> 10:44.709
but I need you to baby-sit.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.277
Three of the turtles have
turned into 5-year-olds.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.714
Mmm, they always did
seem a little immature.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.281
I know it's
asking a lot, but--

10:51.283 --> 10:52.550
Oh, say no more.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.785
I'll keep an eye on
the little shrinkers.

10:54.787 --> 10:57.621
Irma, I love you for this.

10:57.623 --> 10:59.456
Hmm. So how come
I have a feeling

10:59.458 --> 11:01.258
I'll hate myself for this?

11:05.296 --> 11:07.865
Okay, boss,
now can you tell us

11:07.867 --> 11:10.868
why we're filling
these balloons with helium?

11:10.870 --> 11:13.371
Keep on filling them,
and don't ask
stupid questions.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.040
Krang, why are they
filling the balloons
with helium?

11:16.042 --> 11:18.609
I guess it's safe now
to tell you.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.379
I've sent
this same treasure map

11:21.381 --> 11:25.215
to the city's most notorious
criminal ringleaders.

11:25.217 --> 11:30.120
It shows the location
of a chest filled
with stolen treasure

11:30.122 --> 11:33.791
buried on a secret
tropical island.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.793
What secret tropical island?

11:35.795 --> 11:40.397
The one my foot soldiers are
building at this very moment.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.566
Come this way.

11:44.002 --> 11:47.004
So this is your
treasure island?

11:47.006 --> 11:51.508
Yes, as phony as
the proverbial $3.00 bill.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.110
It will be kept afloat

11:53.112 --> 11:56.179
by the stolen helium-filled
weather balloons,

11:56.181 --> 11:58.515
while this heavy chain

11:58.517 --> 12:01.052
hooked to the top
of the Technodrome

12:01.054 --> 12:03.520
will keep it
from floating away.

12:03.522 --> 12:07.191
Once all the greedy
treasure-hungry criminals

12:07.193 --> 12:08.760
are aboard the island,

12:08.762 --> 12:11.763
I plan to cut the chain,

12:11.765 --> 12:17.001
and all my competition
will just go floating away.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.702
And I, and I alone,

12:18.704 --> 12:22.840
will be the boss of
the entire underworld!

12:22.842 --> 12:25.109
That certainly is
a lot of exposition.

12:25.111 --> 12:27.077
Well, someone had to do it.

12:29.948 --> 12:30.848
[yawns]

12:30.850 --> 12:33.517
Wow. I feel better.

12:33.519 --> 12:37.054
Yeah, I guess our little
bodies needed a nappy.

12:37.056 --> 12:40.691
Oh, hi, Auntie Irma.
What are you
doing here?

12:40.693 --> 12:42.093
I'm turtle-sitting.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.895
Hey, I'm hungry.
What you got to eat?

12:44.897 --> 12:49.200
Ice cream! Get your
Jolly Times ice cream!

12:49.202 --> 12:51.635
Ooh,
now that sounds yummy.

12:51.637 --> 12:54.872
Hey, Mr. Ice Cream Man!
Stop!

12:54.874 --> 12:57.074
We'll be right down!

12:57.076 --> 12:59.576
No, guys, wait! Come back!

12:59.578 --> 13:03.380
Wait up, mister!
We wanna get some ice cream!

13:04.583 --> 13:06.350
Get a move on, you guys.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.753
We gotta dig up
that hidden treasure.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.988
Gangway, mister!
Sorry.

13:10.990 --> 13:11.989
You little brats!

13:11.991 --> 13:14.324
That man
sure looks familiar.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.894
Don't you remember?
That was Big Louie.

13:16.896 --> 13:18.729
We beat him lots of times.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.898
Oh, no.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.801
The ice cream truck
is driving away.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.369
We gotta stop it!

13:26.337 --> 13:29.540
[all]
Tiny turtle power!

13:31.143 --> 13:33.343
This is the last time
I sit for any baby,

13:33.345 --> 13:35.146
even if it doesn't
have a shell.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.481
Oh, no!

13:39.651 --> 13:43.888
[gulp]
Maybe this wasn't such
a neat idea after all.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.256
[horn honks]

13:47.826 --> 13:49.326
No!

13:52.397 --> 13:54.731
Quick, Leonardo,
what do we do now?

13:54.733 --> 13:56.867
What are you asking me for?

13:56.869 --> 13:59.203
I'm just a little
tiny turtle.

14:01.539 --> 14:04.275
Don't sweat it, micro-dudes.
I got you!

14:07.746 --> 14:09.913
Turtles, are you all right?

14:09.915 --> 14:13.985
Wow, Auntie Irma,
you got your head on
upside-down.

14:13.987 --> 14:17.121
What a neat trick!
How do you do that?

14:17.123 --> 14:19.422
It's better
that you don't know.

14:21.292 --> 14:25.395
Ah, Mother Nature
is about to give birth

14:25.397 --> 14:27.397
to Bogus Island.

14:29.033 --> 14:30.468
[Krang laughs]

14:30.470 --> 14:33.203
I feel just like a new daddy.

14:39.211 --> 14:43.447
<i>Well, Shredder, what do</i>
<i>you think of my scheme now?</i>

14:43.449 --> 14:46.950
So far, this crackpot idea
of yours seems to be working.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.952
What do we do with
this leftover balloon?

14:48.954 --> 14:50.888
Ooh! Whoa!

14:50.890 --> 14:55.292
Help! Boss! Help!

14:55.294 --> 14:58.228
Idiots! Must I do everything?

14:58.230 --> 15:00.798
Please, get us down!

15:02.233 --> 15:04.634
Whoa!

15:08.006 --> 15:10.473
If these are
your typical earthlings,

15:10.475 --> 15:12.609
why am I having
so much trouble

15:12.611 --> 15:15.445
conquering
this dumpy planet?

15:18.216 --> 15:19.283
Get those bad guys!

15:19.285 --> 15:20.817
Hi, guys, I'm back.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.454
Oh! My apartment!

15:23.456 --> 15:24.888
What happened to it?

15:24.890 --> 15:27.124
It was invaded
by turtle tykes.

15:27.126 --> 15:28.726
What'd you bring us,
Auntie April?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.461
Huh?
Some pizza?

15:30.463 --> 15:32.029
What about
Donatello's workshop?

15:32.031 --> 15:34.965
Did you find an antidote
for the revivifier ray?

15:34.967 --> 15:36.100
Nada.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.002
Donatello, think!

15:38.004 --> 15:42.539
About your invention,
do you have an antidote?

15:42.541 --> 15:45.675
Uh, an Auntie Dote?

15:45.677 --> 15:48.678
No, you're the only
auntie I've got.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.618
[Krang]
Look, there's
Pinkie McFingers

15:54.620 --> 15:56.820
arriving in his
private yacht.

15:56.822 --> 15:59.890
And now Big Louie
and his henchmen.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.858
[Shredder]
And there's Mad Dog McMutt.

16:01.860 --> 16:03.794
He's especially
good at digging.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.263
Ha. Little do
they realize,

16:06.265 --> 16:09.066
but soon I will be
the only villain

16:09.068 --> 16:11.468
this city will
have to contend with.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.438
Ha ha ha ha!

16:16.307 --> 16:19.777
What's this?
Only the story of the century!

16:19.779 --> 16:22.612
April O'Neil, get on the horn!

16:22.614 --> 16:23.814
[phone rings]

16:23.816 --> 16:24.948
What's up, Chief?

16:24.950 --> 16:27.217
<i>Forget the stolen</i>
<i>helium story.</i>

16:27.219 --> 16:28.919
<i>Something bigger</i>
<i>is breaking,</i>

16:28.921 --> 16:30.787
<i>and I want you</i>
<i>to cover it!</i>

16:30.789 --> 16:32.556
Can't you get
Vernon to cover it?

16:32.558 --> 16:34.625
Things are breaking here,
too.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.794
If you don't do it,
something else
will be broken.

16:37.796 --> 16:39.730
Your contract!

16:39.732 --> 16:43.467
Uh, in that case,
what's the scoop?

16:43.469 --> 16:44.235
That's better.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.936
Hoards of
underworld characters

16:45.938 --> 16:49.239
are converging
on a mysterious
offshore island.

16:49.241 --> 16:51.642
Now go check it out!
Go, go, go, go!

16:51.644 --> 16:52.776
Oh, boy!

16:52.778 --> 16:55.279
We wanna go with you
and help you
catch those crooks!

16:55.281 --> 16:57.448
Please, can we?
Please, can we? Huh?
Please, Auntie April?

16:57.450 --> 17:00.684
Absolutely not.
It's much too dangerous.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.022
I hope those
little turtles

17:06.025 --> 17:07.924
aren't planning
on following us.

17:07.925 --> 17:11.462
No way. I triple locked
the pad personally.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.130
Huh?
Surprise!

17:13.132 --> 17:15.532
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.534
Are we there yet?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.169
I have to go.

17:18.171 --> 17:21.472
Chill, dudes. We'll scope out
the island any minute now.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.374
There it is.
I see it.

17:26.144 --> 17:27.743
Someone sees us!

17:27.746 --> 17:30.914
You sure that ain't
one of the invited guests?

17:30.916 --> 17:35.752
No, you simp.
It's that nosy reporter
April O'Neil.

17:35.754 --> 17:37.254
Get her!

17:38.423 --> 17:39.723
Oh, no!

17:39.725 --> 17:41.291
The rotors have been hit!

17:41.293 --> 17:42.092
Bummer!

17:42.094 --> 17:44.328
[shouting]

17:46.164 --> 17:49.333
You got a barf bag
on this thing?

17:53.371 --> 17:55.705
[shouting]

17:55.707 --> 17:58.975
All right.
We got it.

17:58.977 --> 18:02.946
Ha. Let's go take
April O'Neil prisoner.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.583
Is everyone all right?

18:06.585 --> 18:08.418
Yeah. That was neato!

18:08.420 --> 18:09.819
Can we go
on that ride again?

18:09.821 --> 18:12.223
When do we
fight the bad guys?

18:12.225 --> 18:15.592
I told you before, Leonardo,
there'll be no fighting.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.394
Ah, phooey.

18:17.396 --> 18:18.929
We were looking forward

18:18.931 --> 18:21.665
to some real bone crushing
head banging.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.235
[gasps]
Rocksteady and Bebop!

18:24.237 --> 18:25.802
We'll handle this, April.

18:25.804 --> 18:28.405
Turtles to the rescue!

18:28.407 --> 18:29.572
Get 'em!

18:36.814 --> 18:40.150
So we have uninvited guests.

18:40.152 --> 18:41.751
Shredder!

18:41.753 --> 18:43.320
So you're the one
who's been luring

18:43.322 --> 18:45.655
all these criminals
to this island.

18:45.657 --> 18:48.125
Here's the rest
of them, boss.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.761
You were right.
They have shrunk
to child size.

18:51.763 --> 18:54.097
Oh, how cute.

18:54.099 --> 18:55.299
Kitchy-kitchy-coo.

18:55.301 --> 19:00.270
Still big enough to
handle you, Mr. Shred-head.

19:00.272 --> 19:01.105
Yeah, take that!

19:01.107 --> 19:02.106
And that!

19:02.108 --> 19:03.273
Here!

19:03.275 --> 19:05.442
Get them!
They mustn't escape!

19:05.444 --> 19:06.676
Right, boss.

19:09.013 --> 19:11.315
Hand over that map,
Mad Dog.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.782
The treasure is mine.

19:12.784 --> 19:15.752
That's what
you think, Big Louie.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.521
It belongs to me!

19:29.100 --> 19:30.867
[laughs]

19:30.869 --> 19:33.437
That's the end
of the turtles.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.905
Yeah, three
of them, anyway.

19:37.742 --> 19:38.742
Good news, boss.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.978
The turtles are gone.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.513
What?
Oh, no.

19:44.816 --> 19:47.817
Those mutants are
big dummies, aren't they?

19:47.819 --> 19:51.721
Yeah. They don't realize
we love to play in water.

19:52.990 --> 19:55.091
Guys, I hate to tell ya,

19:55.093 --> 19:57.594
but there's something
weird going on here.

19:57.596 --> 20:00.830
We're growing big,
and our voices
are changing.

20:00.832 --> 20:04.335
We found the antidote
to the revivifier ray.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.838
It's plain old salt water.
Our natural environment.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.739
Success, Krang.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.676
The last of the turtles
is my prisoner.

20:12.678 --> 20:14.878
<i>And do you have</i>
<i>plans for him?</i>

20:14.880 --> 20:17.381
He and the unfortunate
Miss O'Neil

20:17.383 --> 20:19.717
will float off
into the stratosphere

20:19.719 --> 20:22.386
along with all
the underworld buffoons.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.754
Thanks to myself,

20:23.756 --> 20:27.857
the turtles are finito,
kaput, wiped out!

20:27.859 --> 20:30.193
Not in this
lifetime, tin grin.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.929
We're anything
but wiped out.

20:32.931 --> 20:34.931
Wouldn't you
agree, compadre?

20:34.933 --> 20:36.966
Most monumentally, amigo.

20:36.968 --> 20:39.936
Cowabunga!

20:39.938 --> 20:41.805
Don't just stand there,
you horn heads!

20:41.807 --> 20:43.373
Get them!

20:43.375 --> 20:45.709
It'll be our
pleasure, boss.

20:47.479 --> 20:50.580
Stand back, guys.
This one's on me.

20:55.053 --> 20:57.987
Or should I say
on Rocksteady and Bebop!

20:57.989 --> 21:00.557
Foot soldiers,
attack the turtles!

21:02.527 --> 21:04.695
My turn!

21:07.999 --> 21:10.667
Quickly, back
to the Technodrome.

21:14.739 --> 21:17.408
Oh, great!
Another failure!

21:17.410 --> 21:21.511
Once again, I'll have to
handle things myself.

21:33.024 --> 21:35.025
[April]
The island,
it's floating away!

21:35.027 --> 21:38.529
So that's why
Shredder stole those
helium balloons.

21:38.531 --> 21:41.364
Turtles, what are
we waiting for?

21:41.366 --> 21:43.433
[all]
Turtle power!

21:56.748 --> 22:00.250
The good news is
we stopped the island
from floating away.

22:00.252 --> 22:01.418
And the bad news?

22:01.420 --> 22:03.654
Uh, it's starting to sink.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.822
I don't mean
to panic anyone,

22:05.824 --> 22:07.890
but we gotta
get off of this thing.

22:07.892 --> 22:10.627
Hold on. We can't
leave without April.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.129
But where is she?

22:12.131 --> 22:15.499
Yoo-hoo, fellas!
I'm over here!

22:15.501 --> 22:17.901
You repaired the rotor blade?

22:17.903 --> 22:21.004
Hey, Donatello's
not the only one
who can fix things.

22:22.307 --> 22:24.908
Channel 6 news copter
calling the Coastguard.

22:24.910 --> 22:27.811
Proceed to latitude 72,
longitude 13,

22:27.813 --> 22:30.414
and rescue
sinking island survivors.

22:30.416 --> 22:33.717
Oh, and be sure to bring
plenty of handcuffs.

22:41.392 --> 22:44.328
Thanks for helping me
dismantle this revivifier.

22:44.330 --> 22:47.897
Man, if I never
see it again,
it'll be too soon.

22:49.266 --> 22:51.668
Greetings, my students.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.770
Welcome back
from your retreat,
Master Splinter.

22:53.772 --> 22:57.574
How refreshing to see you
all working so diligently.

22:57.576 --> 23:00.510
what has brought about
this new attitude?

23:00.512 --> 23:03.146
Well, let's just say

23:03.148 --> 23:06.350
we've done
a lot of growing up
while you were away.
