03:46.008 --> 03:47.740
Chris!

03:48.743 --> 03:49.910
Chris! What the hell?

03:49.912 --> 03:51.610
Would you keep it down?

03:53.915 --> 03:55.080
- What the hell?
- What?

03:55.082 --> 03:57.650
Please keep your music down.

03:57.652 --> 03:59.853
I swear, Shannon
is going to leave me

03:59.855 --> 04:01.754
with all this loud music
you keep playing.

04:01.756 --> 04:04.824
I'll keep it down.

04:04.826 --> 04:06.460
Listen.

04:06.462 --> 04:08.093
I know I said
you could live here,

04:08.095 --> 04:09.795
and you're my best friend,

04:09.797 --> 04:12.033
but you're
really affecting my life.

04:14.069 --> 04:15.769
I get it.

04:15.771 --> 04:17.503
You and your girl want space.

04:17.505 --> 04:19.204
I'll just find
someone's garage.

04:19.207 --> 04:20.709
It's no big thing.

04:21.942 --> 04:25.511
Listen. Shannon
is not just any chick.

04:25.513 --> 04:27.780
Don't be afraid
to lose her, man.

04:27.782 --> 04:30.950
And if you do, so what?

04:30.952 --> 04:32.785
She'll be back.

04:32.787 --> 04:34.424
You have a good thing
going here.

04:36.258 --> 04:38.525
Your grandmother left you
her house.

04:38.527 --> 04:40.126
She didn't really know
how to decorate that well,

04:40.128 --> 04:42.128
but that's why I'm here.

04:42.130 --> 04:44.965
Just relax, dude.
It's gonna be all right.

04:44.967 --> 04:48.037
Chris, you'll never change.

05:17.065 --> 05:19.164
This...

05:20.801 --> 05:23.770
- Hello.
- Hello.

05:23.772 --> 05:25.575
Excuse me while
I cough this up.

05:27.676 --> 05:28.909
So...

05:28.911 --> 05:30.176
- Shots.
- Shots?

05:30.178 --> 05:31.714
Let's do it.

05:52.099 --> 05:53.700
- Do you want more?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

05:53.702 --> 05:56.802
Chris! What the fuck?
Really?

05:56.804 --> 05:58.638
- Andy.
- Right now?

05:58.640 --> 06:00.205
You know Shannon's coming
home in, like, 15 minutes,

06:00.207 --> 06:02.142
and she hates you,

06:02.144 --> 06:04.109
and you're destroying
our relationship.

06:04.111 --> 06:05.311
Come on.

06:05.313 --> 06:06.946
You know, when I said
you could live here,

06:06.948 --> 06:09.248
I didn't mean like this.

06:09.250 --> 06:13.352
Andy, these are my friends.

06:13.354 --> 06:14.653
Say hi.

06:14.655 --> 06:16.989
- Hi.
- Hi, Andy.

06:16.991 --> 06:18.857
- We'll be done soon.
- I've never seen your friends...

06:18.859 --> 06:20.359
These friends before.

06:20.361 --> 06:21.927
Yeah, well...

06:21.929 --> 06:23.929
that doesn't make them
any less friends.

06:23.931 --> 06:26.099
- Okay?
- How do you know them?

06:26.101 --> 06:28.871
They're my friends, Andy.

06:33.075 --> 06:35.040
- Get in the pool.
- Get in the pool, man.

06:35.042 --> 06:37.309
- Are you drunk?
- Yes, I'm drunk.

06:37.311 --> 06:38.645
Of course.

06:38.647 --> 06:39.946
It's not an insult.

06:39.948 --> 06:42.082
Don't you have work
in the morning?

06:42.084 --> 06:44.249
- Andy, come have fun with us.
- Cindy. You can have Cindy over here.

06:44.251 --> 06:46.652
Candy. Candy or Cindy?

06:46.654 --> 06:48.955
You don't even know
your friends' names, Chris.

06:48.957 --> 06:51.958
- My name's Krissy.
- How do you know what her name is?

06:51.960 --> 06:54.059
My name's Krissy.

06:54.061 --> 06:55.628
Whatever.

06:55.630 --> 06:57.397
Candy's a lot different
than Krissy, Chris.

06:57.399 --> 07:02.167
She's... she's...
She tastes like Candy.

07:02.169 --> 07:04.236
- Oh, no. No.
- Andy.

07:04.238 --> 07:05.772
No, no, no, no, no.

07:05.774 --> 07:07.640
Stop it, guys.
I can't do this right now.

07:07.642 --> 07:08.642
- Yes.
- No, no, no.

07:08.644 --> 07:10.342
Have some fun, Andy.

07:10.344 --> 07:12.979
Get with the times, Andy.

07:15.816 --> 07:17.819
Wow, this is nice.

07:21.423 --> 07:23.722
Shannon's gonna be
so mad at me.

07:23.724 --> 07:25.958
Shannon's not here.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.227
- You're not wasting...
- Pouring Tequila.

07:28.229 --> 07:30.729
I love you, too.
I like you more.

07:30.731 --> 07:32.698
- Got it.
- Yeah.

07:32.700 --> 07:33.969
What the fuck.

07:39.140 --> 07:41.273
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, shit.

07:41.275 --> 07:43.075
Strippers?

07:43.077 --> 07:45.345
You, you, you, and you,

07:45.347 --> 07:47.380
get the fuck out of here.

07:47.382 --> 07:49.982
So sorry, guys.

07:49.984 --> 07:53.253
Did you just... did you
just apologize to them?

07:53.255 --> 07:55.287
Yes.

07:55.289 --> 07:57.056
Andy, I would expect
better from you.

07:57.058 --> 07:58.991
I can't believe this shit.

07:58.993 --> 08:01.193
Shannon, I tried
to get them out of here

08:01.195 --> 08:02.696
- as soon as I...
- Oh, really?

08:02.698 --> 08:04.633
You... you mean
like I just did?

08:09.137 --> 08:10.804
No.

08:10.806 --> 08:12.237
You let Chris run
your fucking life,

08:12.239 --> 08:14.006
and you always put him
first before me.

08:14.008 --> 08:18.277
I'd never be able to party
in this house like he does.

08:18.279 --> 08:21.246
I just can't fucking
believe this.

08:21.248 --> 08:23.450
I've had it, Andy.
I'm not living in a house

08:23.452 --> 08:26.251
that has strippers
and hookers in it.

08:26.253 --> 08:29.823
It's me or him.

08:29.825 --> 08:31.424
Shannon, you know it's you.

08:31.426 --> 08:33.058
- Of course it's you.
- You know what?

08:33.059 --> 08:35.027
It's too late, Andy.
I can't take this anymore.

08:35.029 --> 08:37.330
I'm done.
I'm so fucking done.

08:37.332 --> 08:41.301
- Come on, Shannon.
- Don't touch me.

08:41.303 --> 08:42.804
Why do you have to be
such a bitch?

08:48.309 --> 08:50.409
What the fuck?

08:50.411 --> 08:52.280
Shannon? What the fuck?

08:53.380 --> 08:55.148
Shannon, don't do this.

08:55.150 --> 08:58.283
Don't go. Please don't
do this to me right now.

08:58.285 --> 09:00.854
Listen. I'll kick Chris out.

09:00.856 --> 09:02.455
We can have
this whole place together.

09:02.457 --> 09:07.860
Please don't do this.
Shannon.

09:07.862 --> 09:08.994
Shannon, please.

09:08.996 --> 09:11.833
I'm sorry, Andy.

09:50.237 --> 09:51.439
Hey, buddy.

09:52.941 --> 09:55.508
I heard you guys.

09:55.510 --> 09:57.279
I'm sorry you lost her.

09:59.213 --> 10:04.082
I process pain a little
differently than you, but...

10:04.084 --> 10:07.452
So I know I'm probably
not much use.

10:07.454 --> 10:09.224
Just go away, Chris.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.460
I just wanna lay here

10:14.462 --> 10:17.897
like an atom
or a molecule.

10:17.899 --> 10:19.400
I can't be anything else.

10:21.369 --> 10:24.336
Spring will come.

10:24.338 --> 10:25.440
All right.

10:26.473 --> 10:27.943
I'll check in with you later.

10:30.377 --> 10:32.247
The walls look good.

10:34.415 --> 10:36.081
Yeah.

10:36.083 --> 10:39.252
Your fucking painting
is impeccable.

10:39.254 --> 10:41.086
We live in hell now.

10:41.088 --> 10:42.357
Literally.

10:45.961 --> 10:47.830
I'll just order
some food then.

11:58.033 --> 11:59.467
I don't wanna do this.

12:00.935 --> 12:02.470
Fuck you.

12:05.206 --> 12:07.072
Gotta take a whiz, man.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.341
What the fuck are you doing?

12:09.343 --> 12:10.944
What the fuck, man?

12:10.946 --> 12:12.979
You didn't take any of those,
did you?

12:12.981 --> 12:14.479
Did you take those?

12:14.481 --> 12:15.480
- Did you...
- No.

12:15.482 --> 12:16.516
- No.
- Look at me.

12:16.518 --> 12:17.550
Did you take those?

12:17.552 --> 12:19.118
No, I didn't.

12:19.120 --> 12:23.255
Okay. Good 'cause that's
boner medication, bro.

12:23.257 --> 12:26.725
You'd have had a boner
for a long time.

12:26.727 --> 12:28.360
Shit, man.

12:29.463 --> 12:31.263
Come on.
Come to my room.

12:31.265 --> 12:32.565
Chris, I don't want to go
to your room.

12:32.567 --> 12:34.200
- Let's go.
- I just wanna go to sleep.

12:34.202 --> 12:36.402
I wanna show you something.
Let's go. Come on.

12:36.404 --> 12:37.637
- You're gonna like this.
- Fine.

12:37.639 --> 12:39.138
You're gonna like it.
Trust me.

12:39.140 --> 12:41.340
Fine.

12:41.342 --> 12:44.042
Listen, man, I've been
thinking about your situation

12:44.044 --> 12:47.513
and I've got something
to show you.

12:47.515 --> 12:50.085
This, my friend,
is the Doll.

12:51.318 --> 12:55.687
Hot chicks.
Hot Russian chicks.

12:55.689 --> 12:58.090
This is what you do
all day in here?

12:58.092 --> 13:00.125
- Yeah.
- Look at mail-order brides?

13:00.127 --> 13:03.562
Yeah, sorta. They're like
an escort or a pro ho.

13:03.564 --> 13:04.666
Uh...

13:06.167 --> 13:07.266
They come for a week,

13:07.268 --> 13:09.502
and you get to try them out,

13:09.504 --> 13:12.205
and it'll be fun.

13:12.207 --> 13:14.342
And it'll make
Shannon jealous.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.711
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:19.713 --> 13:21.214
Hmm.

13:21.216 --> 13:22.648
You know, chicks, dude,

13:22.650 --> 13:24.249
they can't fucking handle
when a guy upgrades

13:24.251 --> 13:25.384
to a better model.

13:25.386 --> 13:27.019
And this, my friend,

13:27.021 --> 13:29.055
is a much better model.

13:29.057 --> 13:30.092
Hmm.

13:32.092 --> 13:33.625
You know what?

13:33.627 --> 13:36.561
That's not a bad idea.

13:36.563 --> 13:39.197
If she sees me
with one of these girls,

13:39.199 --> 13:40.499
she might come back.

13:40.501 --> 13:43.769
Yeah, I wish I had that idea.

13:43.771 --> 13:45.338
Okay. Let me look into it.

13:45.340 --> 13:47.773
Yeah.

13:47.775 --> 13:49.274
Watch your feet,
motherfucker.

13:49.276 --> 13:50.409
Oh, wow.

13:50.411 --> 13:51.543
Yeah, she's hot, huh?

13:51.545 --> 13:53.112
- She's definitely hot.
- Yeah?

13:53.114 --> 13:54.346
I would say so.

13:54.348 --> 13:55.514
Uh, give me your card.

13:55.516 --> 13:57.483
Why mine?

13:57.485 --> 13:59.688
Because I don't have
a bank account.

14:00.722 --> 14:02.057
Come on.

14:06.727 --> 14:08.494
Are we gonna really do this?

14:08.496 --> 14:11.696
What kind of guys
order escorts?

14:11.698 --> 14:12.764
All guys order escorts.

14:12.766 --> 14:14.402
Give me your card, idiot.

14:16.270 --> 14:17.836
And I need your phone.

14:17.838 --> 14:19.638
What else do you need?

14:19.640 --> 14:20.641
Uh...

14:21.775 --> 14:23.245
This'll be good for now.

14:24.511 --> 14:26.347
Right.
Here's the number.

14:31.452 --> 14:32.553
Okay.

14:38.393 --> 14:40.526
Hi, I'd like to
order one of your girls...

14:40.528 --> 14:42.595
That... Well...
Yeah, no, the Dolls.

14:42.597 --> 14:45.263
Okay.

14:45.265 --> 14:48.100
Uh, for a week.

14:48.102 --> 14:49.137
A week?

14:50.304 --> 14:52.537
I'll pick her up.

14:52.539 --> 14:53.873
Yeah, a week.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.675
This guy...
he's got a thick accent.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.279
I can't understand
what he says.

14:59.146 --> 15:01.513
Great. Um...

15:01.515 --> 15:02.748
I can just text you
the information, right?

15:02.750 --> 15:03.748
On the card?

15:03.750 --> 15:06.252
Text me the address.

15:06.254 --> 15:08.490
Fantastic. All right.
Thanks.

15:16.197 --> 15:17.363
Chris.

15:17.365 --> 15:18.364
- What?
- How much was she?

15:18.366 --> 15:19.367
Just a second, dude.

15:25.340 --> 15:29.242
You are almost complete.

15:29.244 --> 15:31.344
Perfect.

15:31.346 --> 15:37.182
Made from
beautiful human parts.

15:37.184 --> 15:40.255
We now have to retrieve
your soul.

15:55.202 --> 15:57.773
Now you can kill.

15:59.674 --> 16:00.873
That's all she wrote,
my friend.

16:00.875 --> 16:01.907
Take your shit.

16:01.909 --> 16:03.643
And we gotta get ready.

16:03.645 --> 16:05.311
She's gonna be here tonight.
Let's go.

16:05.313 --> 16:07.282
Out. Dude, I gotta get ready,
man. Come on.

16:09.317 --> 16:10.852
A mail-order Russian.

17:33.534 --> 17:34.636
Shannon?

17:43.578 --> 17:45.247
Hello.

17:48.448 --> 17:49.650
Please come in.

18:04.399 --> 18:05.801
Andy?

18:08.468 --> 18:12.407
Yes. Just give me a second.

18:16.944 --> 18:18.513
Open up.

18:19.580 --> 18:20.716
Open up.

18:24.319 --> 18:26.084
Dude, she's here.

18:26.086 --> 18:27.989
And she's unreal.
You have to see this.

18:31.726 --> 18:33.861
- Showtime.
- What?

18:38.565 --> 18:40.666
Oh, my God.

18:40.668 --> 18:41.937
Oh, my frickin' God.

18:43.071 --> 18:44.706
We hit the jackpot.

18:46.541 --> 18:50.076
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, I'm Chris.

18:50.078 --> 18:51.580
How are you?

18:53.413 --> 18:54.448
I'm gonna get your bags.

18:59.486 --> 19:02.024
Andy? Where are
we gonna put her?

19:03.957 --> 19:05.694
Um...

19:07.794 --> 19:09.494
Attic?

19:09.496 --> 19:11.530
Yeah, we can put her...
we can put her in the attic.

19:11.532 --> 19:14.399
- Right? Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, I guess.

19:14.401 --> 19:15.403
- This way.
- This way.

19:22.142 --> 19:23.978
Uh, just step upstairs.

19:26.613 --> 19:28.382
All the way up.

19:29.883 --> 19:31.620
I'll catch you.
Don't worry.

20:10.457 --> 20:12.425
Do you need anything?
Water?

20:12.427 --> 20:13.895
Is the temperature all right?

20:17.465 --> 20:22.670
Okay, so we'll see you
in the morning?

20:24.104 --> 20:25.437
Okay, then.

20:25.439 --> 20:27.505
Uh...

20:27.507 --> 20:29.777
All right,
we'll see you in the morning.

20:32.213 --> 20:33.615
Yeah.

21:03.477 --> 21:06.645
Dude, I can't believe
you put her in the attic.

21:06.647 --> 21:07.946
It's classic, dude.

21:07.948 --> 21:09.548
What's wrong with the attic?

21:09.550 --> 21:11.649
Your grandmother's
shit is up there,

21:11.651 --> 21:13.017
covered in dust, dude.

21:13.019 --> 21:14.520
You know I promised her
I wouldn't move it.

21:14.522 --> 21:16.155
She'll be all right.

21:16.157 --> 21:17.590
I gotta go to bed.

21:17.592 --> 21:18.823
Go to bed?

21:20.026 --> 21:21.894
You wanna go to bed
right now?

21:21.896 --> 21:23.896
What do we do with her?
What's the plan?

21:23.898 --> 21:24.996
Dude, calm down.

21:24.998 --> 21:27.233
Go take a shower
and jerk off

21:27.235 --> 21:28.868
and we'll deal with it
in the morning.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.002
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:30.004 --> 21:31.070
I'll go jerk off.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.640
Fuck, what are you gonna do?

22:10.076 --> 22:11.276
Oh, shit.

22:11.278 --> 22:13.745
Natasha.

22:13.747 --> 22:15.616
What are you doing in here?

22:17.784 --> 22:19.920
Oh, are you okay?

22:21.155 --> 22:22.821
Come on. Let's...

22:22.823 --> 22:23.856
Let's get you out of here.

22:23.858 --> 22:25.189
Let's get you to bed.

22:25.191 --> 22:27.061
Come on.

22:37.304 --> 22:40.171
Are you sure I can't get
you anything to drink?

22:40.173 --> 22:41.842
Water? Snacks?

22:46.280 --> 22:47.846
You'll be all right,

22:47.848 --> 22:49.150
get a good night's
sleep here.

27:00.400 --> 27:04.035
Hey, are you okay?

27:04.037 --> 27:05.503
Chris told me
that I should come over

27:05.505 --> 27:07.105
and drop something off,

27:07.107 --> 27:09.344
and I wanted to know if...

27:10.977 --> 27:12.343
Is everything all right?

27:12.345 --> 27:13.547
Miss?

28:55.181 --> 28:56.918
This way, Natasha.

29:00.387 --> 29:01.956
Put you back in bed.

29:52.105 --> 29:54.374
Well, hello, good looking.
I'm Ron.

29:57.444 --> 29:59.043
I'm looking for Chris.

29:59.045 --> 30:01.146
It's about one of my girls.

30:01.148 --> 30:04.015
You see,
Chris likes to order my girls,

30:04.017 --> 30:06.184
but then he doesn't pay
for them

30:06.186 --> 30:08.619
'cause all of his credit cards
get declined.

30:08.621 --> 30:12.157
It's hurting my business.

30:12.159 --> 30:13.524
Who do you work for?

30:13.526 --> 30:15.793
Oh, let me guess. Guido.

30:15.795 --> 30:18.163
Another dishonest
little snake.

30:18.165 --> 30:21.433
He owes me money also.

30:21.435 --> 30:22.600
I tell you what.

30:22.602 --> 30:24.136
Do me a favor.

30:24.138 --> 30:25.503
If you run into Maritza,

30:25.505 --> 30:27.606
and you will
because she works here...

30:27.608 --> 30:29.474
She shouldn't but she does.

30:29.476 --> 30:30.675
If you run into her,

30:30.677 --> 30:32.043
just say that I...

30:32.045 --> 30:33.477
If she had stuck with me

30:33.479 --> 30:35.080
and hadn't left,

30:35.082 --> 30:36.648
she'd be making twice
the money

30:36.650 --> 30:38.516
she's making right now.

30:38.518 --> 30:40.051
Please tell her.
Okay?

30:40.053 --> 30:41.188
Anyway, here.

30:43.189 --> 30:45.293
Make sure Chris knows I gotta
get a hold of him, okay?

30:47.761 --> 30:50.128
Oh, for God sakes.

30:50.130 --> 30:52.097
You don't even speak English.

30:52.099 --> 30:54.800
Oh, that was
a great waste of time.

30:54.802 --> 30:57.502
Well, if any girls
wanna get a hold of me...

30:57.504 --> 30:59.236
and they should,

30:59.238 --> 31:01.473
here. Okay? Keep it.

31:01.475 --> 31:03.477
Ugh! Stop!

31:06.746 --> 31:08.612
Please. Please.

31:08.614 --> 31:10.017
Please.

31:25.798 --> 31:28.166
Yeah, what's up?

31:28.168 --> 31:30.435
There's something wrong
with Natasha.

31:30.437 --> 31:31.436
She isn't normal.

31:31.438 --> 31:33.538
What are you talking about?

31:33.540 --> 31:37.542
She did some weird things
last night.

31:37.544 --> 31:39.778
She's been here one night.

31:39.780 --> 31:42.179
What are you talking about?

31:42.181 --> 31:44.282
She got in the shower
with me.

31:44.284 --> 31:45.716
So that's a good thing,
right?

31:45.718 --> 31:47.586
With her clothes on.

31:47.588 --> 31:50.254
She's foreign.
Come on.

31:50.256 --> 31:53.193
No, you're
not listening to me.

31:56.429 --> 31:58.530
I was sleeping last night,

31:58.532 --> 32:02.833
and I woke up, and she was banging
her head against the wall.

32:02.835 --> 32:04.636
It's really weird.

32:04.638 --> 32:06.338
She banged her what
against the what?

32:07.707 --> 32:09.407
Who's that?

32:09.409 --> 32:11.243
It's only 7:00
in the morning.

32:11.245 --> 32:13.180
It's probably the pool dude.

32:19.620 --> 32:20.886
Oh, shit.

32:20.888 --> 32:22.154
It's Shannon.

32:22.156 --> 32:23.424
What the hell's
she doing here?

32:25.825 --> 32:28.159
Hey, Shannon.

32:28.161 --> 32:29.563
Fuck you, Chris.

32:38.804 --> 32:40.272
Um, look.

32:40.274 --> 32:43.274
My mom's douchebag
boyfriend is back

32:43.276 --> 32:44.642
and I can't stand him.

32:44.644 --> 32:47.212
He's drunk all the time

32:47.214 --> 32:49.680
and he hits on me.

32:49.682 --> 32:51.318
I need to stay here.

32:54.888 --> 32:57.388
Look, I know things
are weird between us,

32:57.390 --> 32:59.459
and maybe I acted
too hastily.

33:01.861 --> 33:04.462
It's okay.

33:04.464 --> 33:06.665
- You can stay here.
- Come on, man.

33:07.900 --> 33:09.469
Shut up, Chris.

33:13.940 --> 33:17.474
Uh, Andy, I really need
to take a shower.

33:17.476 --> 33:18.909
Let's talk afterwards, okay?

33:18.911 --> 33:19.910
Okay, I'll get your bags.

33:19.912 --> 33:21.248
Okay, thank you.

33:26.986 --> 33:28.855
And, Chris?

33:31.525 --> 33:33.824
I really don't want any shit
from you, okay?

33:33.826 --> 33:35.295
I didn't say anything.

33:37.430 --> 33:39.167
What are you smiling about?

33:40.700 --> 33:41.768
Oh, shit.

33:43.336 --> 33:45.337
Oh, shit.

33:45.339 --> 33:46.404
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

33:46.406 --> 33:48.773
- Yeah, I, uh...
- Okay.

33:48.775 --> 33:49.874
Okay, okay.

33:49.876 --> 33:51.576
We need to hide her

33:51.578 --> 33:52.977
before Shannon gets
out of the shower.

33:52.979 --> 33:54.478
No, I think
you should introduce them.

33:54.480 --> 33:55.647
No, that is a terrible idea.

33:55.649 --> 33:56.848
We're not doing that.

33:56.850 --> 33:58.282
You can explain
to your girlfriend

33:58.284 --> 33:59.451
why you have
a mail-order whore here.

33:59.453 --> 34:00.885
No, I'm not doing that.

34:00.887 --> 34:02.920
Oh, no?

34:02.922 --> 34:04.789
- Uh...
- Where should we put her?

34:04.791 --> 34:06.590
I think the attic.

34:06.592 --> 34:08.359
That wasn't a good idea.

34:08.360 --> 34:11.728
She was walking around
the attic all last night.

34:11.731 --> 34:12.830
Let me think.

34:12.831 --> 34:14.931
Okay, um...

34:14.934 --> 34:16.871
Let's just do this.
Let's just get her.

34:18.838 --> 34:20.603
- You wanna take her?
- Yeah, yeah, go for it.

34:20.606 --> 34:22.373
- You wanna lead the way?
- Lead the way, lead the way.

34:22.376 --> 34:24.775
- So we're going this way.
- Right this way, miss.

34:24.777 --> 34:26.710
Okay.

34:26.713 --> 34:28.315
Just right up this way.

34:38.623 --> 34:39.860
Right this way.

34:54.739 --> 34:56.009
Natasha?

34:58.979 --> 35:01.613
Natasha,
is there anything

35:01.615 --> 35:03.383
that you'd like to do
while we're gone?

35:04.550 --> 35:05.652
Knit.

35:06.852 --> 35:09.553
- What?
- Knit?

35:09.555 --> 35:11.525
- She wants to knit.
- Oh.

35:17.064 --> 35:18.499
Here.

35:25.738 --> 35:27.972
Do you want anything to eat?

35:27.974 --> 35:30.941
Uh, eggs? Coffee?

35:30.943 --> 35:32.977
How do you take your coffee?

35:32.979 --> 35:34.482
Black?

35:35.648 --> 35:36.814
Black it is.

35:36.816 --> 35:38.285
All right, let's go.

35:55.068 --> 35:56.468
Wow, dude.

35:56.470 --> 35:57.836
I told you she was weird,
right?

35:57.838 --> 35:59.403
It's just gotta be
a language barrier

35:59.405 --> 36:00.504
or something.

36:00.506 --> 36:02.874
- Yeah, I know.
- It's gotta be.

36:02.876 --> 36:04.541
Fucking crazy.

36:04.543 --> 36:06.111
She'll be okay up there,
right?

36:06.113 --> 36:08.946
No, she's... It's gotta be
a language barrier

36:08.948 --> 36:10.013
or something...

36:10.015 --> 36:11.682
Shh.

36:11.684 --> 36:14.986
What are you guys doing?

36:14.988 --> 36:16.988
Oh, nothing.
We were just talking.

36:16.990 --> 36:21.459
Chris is going to make
some eggs and coffee.

36:21.461 --> 36:23.461
Weird. He never cooks.

36:23.463 --> 36:24.963
He's going
to culinary arts school.

36:24.965 --> 36:27.798
Yeah, it's true.

36:27.800 --> 36:30.103
Yeah, right. He just
says that to stay here.

36:33.106 --> 36:35.472
You know, I...
I'm going to go take a nap.

36:35.474 --> 36:38.910
I'm really tired,
and we can talk later. Okay?

36:38.912 --> 36:41.178
Sure, no problem.
I've gotta go to work anyway.

36:41.180 --> 36:42.749
Okay.

36:48.889 --> 36:51.055
Sweet dreams.

36:51.057 --> 36:53.457
Andy, I don't know why you
let her treat you like that.

36:53.459 --> 36:54.825
She's such a bitch.

36:54.827 --> 36:56.760
Please stop calling
my girlfriend a bitch.

36:56.762 --> 36:58.796
You're a lost cause, man.

36:58.798 --> 37:00.131
Listen,
I gotta go to work now.

37:00.133 --> 37:03.100
Can you hold down the fort
while I'm gone?

37:03.102 --> 37:06.470
Take care of Natasha.
Check on Shannon.

37:06.472 --> 37:08.506
Make sure
she doesn't find her.

37:08.508 --> 37:09.506
- Okay.
- Got it, dude.

37:09.508 --> 37:10.975
You got it?

37:10.977 --> 37:13.644
I... I got it.
Go to work.

37:13.646 --> 37:14.812
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:14.814 --> 37:15.883
Go to work.
I got it.

39:20.340 --> 39:22.140
Natasha.

39:22.142 --> 39:23.977
Made you some eggs.

39:25.345 --> 39:27.581
Oh, shit.

39:30.215 --> 39:32.185
So much for the apron.

40:02.682 --> 40:04.282
What are you doing?

40:04.284 --> 40:06.316
Uh, I was just coming
to check on you.

40:06.318 --> 40:09.023
Andy told me to.

40:10.122 --> 40:11.388
What are you doing up there?

40:11.390 --> 40:13.293
Uh, sorting stuff.

40:14.961 --> 40:17.762
Oh, okay.
Well, I'm fine.

40:17.764 --> 40:20.164
Good, I'm glad.

40:20.166 --> 40:21.365
Are you okay?

40:21.367 --> 40:22.633
You're sweating.

40:22.635 --> 40:24.234
I was just making eggs.

40:24.236 --> 40:26.336
Okay.

40:26.338 --> 40:27.607
Uh...

40:30.677 --> 40:33.410
I'm really sorry if
I'm hard on you sometimes.

40:33.412 --> 40:35.345
It's only to
protect Andy, okay?

40:35.347 --> 40:36.349
Okay.

40:37.349 --> 40:38.585
Okay.

40:41.954 --> 40:43.222
Okay.

41:45.885 --> 41:47.888
Natasha. Sh...

41:50.122 --> 41:51.191
Fuck.

41:57.329 --> 42:00.299
Natasha, oh, my God.

42:03.269 --> 42:04.303
Are you okay?

42:15.180 --> 42:17.414
Uh, okay.

42:17.416 --> 42:20.450
Okay, I'll...
I'll check on you later, then.

42:20.452 --> 42:22.155
All right?

42:24.189 --> 42:25.726
Okay.

43:08.901 --> 43:10.803
Shit, what time is it?

43:24.184 --> 43:25.753
Hey.

43:26.985 --> 43:28.352
Where's Chris?

43:28.354 --> 43:30.488
I don't know.
I haven't seen him all day.

43:30.490 --> 43:32.423
Maybe in his room sleeping.

43:32.425 --> 43:34.294
He hasn't been out all day?

43:46.606 --> 43:47.872
What?

43:47.874 --> 43:49.941
Chris, why are you sleeping?

43:49.943 --> 43:51.211
Um...

43:53.178 --> 43:56.379
I was tired.
Um, I'm good.

43:56.381 --> 43:58.282
Don't worry.

43:58.284 --> 44:00.584
I'll take Natasha
some food in an hour.

44:00.586 --> 44:02.253
Dude, it's after dark now.

44:02.255 --> 44:04.321
This is getting crazy.
She's not an animal.

44:04.323 --> 44:06.289
So we have to
get rid of her, okay?

44:06.291 --> 44:09.059
Shannon is in the next room
watching a movie.

44:09.061 --> 44:10.861
It's only a matter of time
before she sees Natasha.

44:10.863 --> 44:12.963
Dude, don't worry about it.

44:12.965 --> 44:14.934
I'll call that number to come
and get her, okay?

44:24.410 --> 44:25.542
Smells good in here.

44:25.544 --> 44:27.879
What are you cooking?

44:27.881 --> 44:30.013
I don't know.
I don't know what's cooking.

44:30.015 --> 44:31.918
- Come sit.
- Is Chris making something?

44:34.186 --> 44:36.620
What you watching?

44:36.622 --> 44:39.289
Um, I'm watching "Encounter."
Have you seen it?

44:39.291 --> 44:41.225
Oh, I've seen this movie.

44:41.227 --> 44:46.530
This is where the couple goes
to a creepy-ass haunted house,

44:46.532 --> 44:48.966
and there's an old dude there

44:48.968 --> 44:50.968
who scares
the shit out of them,

44:50.970 --> 44:52.637
and there's aliens at the end?

44:52.639 --> 44:54.407
And... and I think
I just gave it away.

44:56.642 --> 44:58.441
Um, yeah.

44:58.443 --> 45:00.443
I've seen it.
It's scary.

45:00.445 --> 45:02.412
I don't know why you like
watching really scary movies.

45:02.414 --> 45:04.347
Because I do like
scary movies.

45:04.349 --> 45:06.350
At night, too,
and by yourself.

45:06.352 --> 45:08.622
Okay.

45:12.557 --> 45:14.457
How was work?

45:14.459 --> 45:17.561
It was good.

45:17.563 --> 45:19.032
Much better now.

46:26.532 --> 46:28.168
- What the fuck?
- What?

46:31.537 --> 46:32.973
What's the matter?

46:36.476 --> 46:38.577
I swear I saw something
over there.

46:41.613 --> 46:43.249
What was it?

46:45.251 --> 46:47.287
Someone.
A woman I think.

46:50.289 --> 46:53.524
Listen,
I'm sure it was nothing.

46:53.526 --> 46:56.059
We both had
a lot to drink today.

46:56.061 --> 46:57.660
It's been a long day.

46:57.662 --> 46:58.762
I'll put you to bed.

46:58.764 --> 46:59.763
Come on.
Let's go to bed.

46:59.765 --> 47:01.233
Maybe you're right.

47:03.668 --> 47:05.438
- Okay.
- Yeah, let's go.

47:41.139 --> 47:43.774
I know I saw something.

47:43.776 --> 47:45.445
I'm sure it was nothing.

47:55.720 --> 47:56.754
Where are you going?

47:56.756 --> 47:58.155
I'll be right back.

47:58.157 --> 47:59.356
No, don't leave.

47:59.358 --> 48:00.691
I have to go check
on something.

48:00.693 --> 48:02.428
Please, Andy,
can you just lay with me?

48:05.530 --> 48:06.799
Okay.

48:28.387 --> 48:31.856
Oh, God, you're such a whore.
I love it.

48:31.858 --> 48:34.225
Yeah, no, just...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that sound...

48:34.227 --> 48:35.559
that sounds real good.

48:35.561 --> 48:38.361
Just... just get over here,
would you?

48:38.363 --> 48:41.499
I-I... Yeah. Yeah.

48:41.501 --> 48:43.867
Yeah, just call me
when you get here.

48:43.869 --> 48:45.471
Okay. Bye.

48:48.573 --> 48:50.740
Fuck, man.

48:50.742 --> 48:52.709
Women.

51:34.006 --> 51:36.409
I know I saw something.

52:07.673 --> 52:09.542
Gross.

52:29.528 --> 52:31.794
The fuck?

52:50.448 --> 52:52.718
"The perfect human"?

52:55.588 --> 52:57.524
What the fuck
kind of shit is this?

53:37.963 --> 53:39.432
Oh, my God.

53:41.534 --> 53:43.035
Where are
the knitting needles?

53:52.778 --> 53:55.081
Harness the soul...

53:58.082 --> 53:59.916
Administer the...

53:59.918 --> 54:00.986
...soul.

54:03.956 --> 54:06.526
What kind of fucking shit
is this?

56:00.872 --> 56:02.075
Shit.

56:20.224 --> 56:22.992
Mm, this is so nice.

56:22.994 --> 56:25.829
Mm, Stacy, I'm cold.

56:25.831 --> 56:27.731
Come here, baby.
I'll warm you up.

56:33.838 --> 56:35.171
So sweet.

56:35.173 --> 56:36.575
Mm.

56:52.090 --> 56:53.293
What's wrong?

56:54.392 --> 56:56.760
It's kind of creepy out here.

56:56.762 --> 56:58.160
Do you wanna go?

56:58.162 --> 56:59.599
No.

57:02.367 --> 57:04.800
Let's go in the back
of Chris' Mercedes.

57:04.802 --> 57:06.903
Hmm. Okay.

57:06.905 --> 57:08.173
Let's go.

57:44.043 --> 57:46.278
Let's take this down.

57:50.782 --> 57:53.115
Do you think
we should go get Chris?

57:53.117 --> 57:55.117
He'll find us eventually.

57:55.119 --> 57:56.622
You're right.
Let's fuck with him.

58:12.336 --> 58:14.239
Oh, my God,
what the fuck?

58:15.807 --> 58:17.307
What the fuck?

58:17.309 --> 58:19.943
Oh, my God!

58:30.756 --> 58:33.155
Please, no. Please.

58:34.226 --> 58:36.093
Please.

58:36.095 --> 58:38.995
No. No!

58:43.035 --> 58:44.904
Please.

59:08.526 --> 59:10.193
Hey, baby.

59:10.195 --> 59:13.229
- How do you do?
- I'm good.

59:14.265 --> 59:16.202
So, you called?

59:17.970 --> 59:20.169
Did you need something?

59:20.171 --> 59:21.171
I did.

59:21.173 --> 59:22.204
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59:22.206 --> 59:23.205
What did you need?

59:23.207 --> 59:25.408
What do you think I need?

59:25.410 --> 59:26.943
Do you need help?

59:26.945 --> 59:28.044
I think you can guess.

59:28.046 --> 59:30.349
- Um, yeah?
- Yeah.

59:32.885 --> 59:35.488
You are a naughty boy.

59:51.068 --> 59:54.470
Mm. Dirty boy wanna take off
his dirty shirt?

59:54.472 --> 59:56.106
- Mm-hm. Yeah.
- Huh?

59:56.108 --> 59:58.144
- Yeah? Take it off.
- Uh-huh.

59:59.343 --> 01:00:00.177
Get on the bed.

01:00:01.947 --> 01:00:04.046
- Do I have to punish you?
- Uh, please.

01:00:04.048 --> 01:00:07.149
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah, I've been bad.

01:00:07.151 --> 01:00:10.986
Hmm?
You a good boy or a bad boy?

01:00:10.988 --> 01:00:13.390
I think you're a good boy.

01:00:13.392 --> 01:00:15.124
You know what good boys get?

01:00:15.126 --> 01:00:16.358
Uh, I don't know. What?

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.195
You don't know
what good boys get?

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:20.196
I hope...

01:00:20.198 --> 01:00:22.432
- Mm, hope it's...
- I don't wanna jinx it.

01:00:22.434 --> 01:00:24.267
Oh, um, do you have
a bathroom?

01:00:24.269 --> 01:00:25.401
Yeah.

01:00:25.403 --> 01:00:26.535
Take your pants off.

01:00:26.537 --> 01:00:28.370
- Okay.
- Take your pants off.

01:00:28.372 --> 01:00:29.775
All right.

01:01:09.581 --> 01:01:11.150
What the fuck?

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:13.309
Are you okay?

01:03:12.403 --> 01:03:13.606
Leslie, where are you?

01:03:17.275 --> 01:03:18.510
Oh, shit.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.253
Leslie.

01:03:30.255 --> 01:03:31.289
What the hell are you...

01:03:35.193 --> 01:03:36.262
Is that you?

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:40.198
What the hell are you
doing up here?

01:03:43.168 --> 01:03:44.633
Oh, my God.

01:03:44.635 --> 01:03:46.037
What the fuck, man?

01:03:54.246 --> 01:03:56.014
What the fuck?

01:04:04.722 --> 01:04:07.490
- Hey.
- What's up? What the...

01:04:07.492 --> 01:04:09.658
What the fuck's the matter?
What's going on?

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.061
- Oh, fuck.
- What's happening?

01:04:11.063 --> 01:04:12.327
Natasha killed Leslie, man.

01:04:12.329 --> 01:04:13.762
What?

01:04:13.764 --> 01:04:15.597
She...

01:04:15.599 --> 01:04:17.100
- Leslie's in the attic.
- What?

01:04:17.102 --> 01:04:18.501
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:04:18.503 --> 01:04:20.102
I just found her in the attic,
dude, stabbed.

01:04:20.104 --> 01:04:21.137
Oh, my God.

01:04:21.139 --> 01:04:23.709
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:04:25.443 --> 01:04:28.178
Okay. Chris.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.778
We gotta call 911.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:31.750
We gotta fucking call
911 right now.

01:04:33.485 --> 01:04:35.318
We gotta... we gotta fucking
report this right now.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.785
- We gotta fucking call...
- Dude, we can't.

01:04:36.787 --> 01:04:38.354
I have a record, dude.

01:04:38.356 --> 01:04:41.390
I could go to jail, man,
with my record.

01:04:41.392 --> 01:04:43.559
Well, call the website.

01:04:43.561 --> 01:04:46.796
Call the fucking number
you got off the website.

01:04:46.798 --> 01:04:48.330
You got that number
from the website, right?

01:04:48.332 --> 01:04:49.432
You saved it
on your phone, right?

01:04:49.434 --> 01:04:50.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:50.602 --> 01:04:51.733
Call the fucking number
right now.

01:04:51.735 --> 01:04:53.503
- I'm calling.
- Oh, come on.

01:04:53.505 --> 01:04:54.637
Oh, my God.

01:04:54.639 --> 01:04:56.508
Oh, shit.

01:04:57.541 --> 01:04:58.675
Hi, yes?

01:04:58.677 --> 01:05:01.244
Um, we...
we got a girl from you,

01:05:01.246 --> 01:05:03.213
and, um, she's...

01:05:03.215 --> 01:05:05.414
Something happened and we need
you to come and get her now.

01:05:05.416 --> 01:05:07.119
Do you understand?

01:05:09.287 --> 01:05:10.519
Come and get her now.

01:05:10.521 --> 01:05:12.789
- Now!
- Fucking pick her up now.

01:05:12.791 --> 01:05:14.624
- What did they say?
- They're coming.

01:05:14.626 --> 01:05:17.559
- How long's it gonna take?
- He's... They're just coming.

01:05:17.561 --> 01:05:19.329
That's all they said?

01:05:19.331 --> 01:05:21.330
- That's all they said.
- Oh, fuck.

01:05:21.332 --> 01:05:24.834
- Chris, what about Shannon?
- What?

01:05:24.836 --> 01:05:27.403
What the fuck?

01:05:27.405 --> 01:05:28.838
- What the fuck? Fucking Shannon.
- Oh, my God.

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.443
What the fuck?

01:05:32.811 --> 01:05:35.778
- It's locked.
- Holy shit.

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:40.617
Try the other fucking door!
Shannon!

01:05:40.619 --> 01:05:42.621
It's fucking locked.
It's fucking locked.

01:05:46.657 --> 01:05:48.293
What the fuck
are we gonna do right now?

01:05:51.796 --> 01:05:52.794
Oh, shit.

01:05:52.796 --> 01:05:54.564
We're fucked, Chris.

01:05:54.566 --> 01:05:58.901
- We're so fucked right now.
- Call that number back.

01:05:58.903 --> 01:06:00.303
Call the fucking
number back right now.

01:06:00.305 --> 01:06:01.704
Call the number back.

01:06:01.706 --> 01:06:03.173
- I'm not calling any...
- Call the number back.

01:06:03.175 --> 01:06:04.474
We gotta take care
of this ourselves.

01:06:04.476 --> 01:06:06.175
Who else can we fucking call
right now?

01:06:06.177 --> 01:06:07.609
There's gotta be someone
fucking else we can call.

01:06:42.414 --> 01:06:44.513
Open up. It's me, Shannon.

01:06:44.515 --> 01:06:46.381
Hurry!

01:06:46.383 --> 01:06:47.452
Stand back.

01:06:56.494 --> 01:06:57.496
What's going on?

01:06:58.762 --> 01:07:00.495
Andy, someone's in the attic.

01:07:00.497 --> 01:07:02.599
I know it was the woman I saw the
other night. I wasn't crazy.

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:04.367
Why would you go in there?

01:07:04.369 --> 01:07:06.401
Because I kept hearing
strange noises,

01:07:06.403 --> 01:07:08.370
so I went there to see if that's
where they were coming from.

01:07:08.372 --> 01:07:10.240
But that's not the point.
I found these papers,

01:07:10.242 --> 01:07:12.510
and will you please tell me
what the fuck this is?

01:07:21.885 --> 01:07:23.389
Oh, my God.

01:07:24.756 --> 01:07:26.622
This is a pentagram.

01:07:26.624 --> 01:07:32.463
It says,
"Shannon, Chris, Andy."

01:07:33.999 --> 01:07:37.800
It's...
it's a picture of Natasha,

01:07:37.802 --> 01:07:41.903
the Doll.

01:07:41.905 --> 01:07:44.606
Oh, shit.
Chris, look at this.

01:07:44.608 --> 01:07:45.877
Oh, my God.

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:54.720
This is my fault, man.

01:07:57.756 --> 01:07:59.655
I made you do it.

01:07:59.657 --> 01:08:01.392
What did you guys do?

01:08:03.827 --> 01:08:06.495
Why is there a woman
in the attic?

01:08:06.497 --> 01:08:07.963
He ordered...
he ordered her for me online.

01:08:07.965 --> 01:08:11.033
I thought I could
get you back.

01:08:11.035 --> 01:08:12.901
You're joking, right?

01:08:12.903 --> 01:08:14.803
No, no, no.

01:08:14.805 --> 01:08:17.907
I'm so sorry, Shannon.
I made him do it.

01:08:17.908 --> 01:08:19.876
I just wanted to get you back.

01:08:19.877 --> 01:08:22.979
You ordered an escort
and kept her in the attic?

01:08:22.981 --> 01:08:24.845
God, you're a sick fuck.

01:08:24.848 --> 01:08:26.448
We knew she was mental,
all right?

01:08:26.451 --> 01:08:27.948
Chris even called
the website

01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:29.084
to get...
to talk to the owner

01:08:29.086 --> 01:08:30.185
to come pick her up.

01:08:30.187 --> 01:08:32.453
What time did he say he was
going to come get her?

01:08:32.456 --> 01:08:33.823
Right, Chris?

01:08:33.825 --> 01:08:35.858
We don't even know
if she's gone or not.

01:08:35.859 --> 01:08:37.827
We don't even know if she's still
in the fucking house or not.

01:08:37.828 --> 01:08:39.697
What if he's as crazy
as she is?

01:08:40.932 --> 01:08:43.800
What are you
going to do then, huh?

01:08:43.801 --> 01:08:45.334
I'm going to go find her,

01:08:45.336 --> 01:08:47.438
and I'm gonna fucking
take care of it.

01:08:50.642 --> 01:08:53.408
I'm scared.

01:08:53.411 --> 01:08:54.546
It's okay.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.017
I'm sorry.

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:00.551
I'm so sorry.

01:10:19.097 --> 01:10:20.599
Natasha.

01:10:24.067 --> 01:10:25.570
Where are you?

01:10:29.139 --> 01:10:30.675
It's time to go home.

01:12:02.066 --> 01:12:03.932
I wonder if Chris is okay.

01:12:03.934 --> 01:12:05.767
I hope so.

01:12:05.769 --> 01:12:07.970
I really hope so.

01:12:07.972 --> 01:12:11.143
Shit. Shit.

01:12:12.677 --> 01:12:14.813
Shit. Shit.

01:12:20.084 --> 01:12:21.519
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

01:12:29.259 --> 01:12:32.664
Shit. Shit!

01:12:34.698 --> 01:12:36.865
- Andy, help me.
- It's locked.

01:12:36.867 --> 01:12:39.670
- Andy, help me.
- I'm trying.

01:12:43.174 --> 01:12:45.173
She's doing this to you.
I've got to get out of here

01:12:45.175 --> 01:12:47.810
and stop whatever
the fuck she's doing to you.

01:12:47.812 --> 01:12:49.680
It feels like
she's stabbing me.

01:12:53.951 --> 01:12:55.086
No.

01:13:09.968 --> 01:13:11.036
Oh, my God!

01:13:14.938 --> 01:13:16.575
Oh, my God!

01:13:20.044 --> 01:13:21.677
Chris, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:13:21.679 --> 01:13:23.913
Chris...

01:13:23.915 --> 01:13:25.347
Shannon, run!

01:13:25.349 --> 01:13:27.182
Run! Get the fuck
out of here!

01:13:27.184 --> 01:13:28.986
Get the fuck out of here!

01:13:30.021 --> 01:13:33.788
Stop! Stop!

01:13:46.204 --> 01:13:48.240
Fuck!

01:13:51.342 --> 01:13:52.777
Get off me!

01:15:08.452 --> 01:15:11.389
No. No.

01:15:13.957 --> 01:15:15.423
Please.

01:15:15.425 --> 01:15:20.395
Chris, don't.

01:15:20.397 --> 01:15:21.699
Don't do this.

01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:24.803
Please.

01:16:52.223 --> 01:16:54.326
Kill me instead.

01:18:44.067 --> 01:18:46.271
You did good.

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.590
You make me proud.

01:19:18.501 --> 01:19:20.170
Time to go.

01:19:21.237 --> 01:19:23.909
We have another client.
