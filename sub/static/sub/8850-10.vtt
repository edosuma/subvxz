- I GAVE YOU A CHOICE THAT DAY.
[chains rattling]

00:48.449 --> 00:50.418
THAT BOY DIDN'T HAVE TO HANG.

00:50.451 --> 00:54.422
- NO, HE DIDN'T.

00:54.455 --> 00:59.193
BUT YOU DO, FOR ALL YOU DONE.

01:50.911 --> 01:54.348
- THE COUNCIL WELCOMES
BISHOP JOSEPH DUTSON.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.489

02:03.324 --> 02:04.592
- MY GOD.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.627
[chains rattle]

02:06.660 --> 02:08.396
- WHY HAS HEAVENLY FATHER

02:08.429 --> 02:11.699
BROUGHT THIS MAN

TRESPASS, AND SEDITION.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.616
FOR THE COUNCIL.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.689
- THE BISHOP ASKED YOU
TO STATE YOUR NAME.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.393

[both grunting]

03:17.598 --> 03:18.666
- I KILLED YOU,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

03:18.699 --> 03:19.700
YOU'RE DEAD!

03:19.733 --> 03:21.302
- GET OFF HIM!

03:21.335 --> 03:22.636

AND YOUR OVERZEALOUS MILITIA!

03:47.060 --> 03:49.563
BRINGING YET ANOTHER VIPER...

03:49.597 --> 03:50.698
- [gasps]

03:50.731 --> 03:52.600
- TO OUR HOLY HOUSE.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.668
- [gasps]

03:54.702 --> 03:58.606
[grunts, sniffles]

03:58.639 --> 04:01.475
- I WILL ASK AGAIN, HMM?

04:04.445 --> 04:07.448
YOUR NAME?

04:07.481 --> 04:10.451
- THOR GUNDERSON.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.753
- [coughs]

04:12.786 --> 04:14.522
WRITE THAT DOWN.
"THOR GUNDERSON."

04:14.555 --> 04:17.491
- THAT'S HIS NAME.
HIS REAL NAME.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.660
- THIS IS BISHOP JOSEPH DUTSON.

04:19.693 --> 04:23.030
- MMM, NO.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.433
GOES BY "THE SWEDE" BACK EAST.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.401
MURDERER OF INNOCENT MEN
AND WOMEN.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.571
- HE IS ELDER OF THE HIGHEST
PRIESTHOOD OFFICE!

04:30.604 --> 04:32.706
HE IS PRESIDENT
OF THE PRIESTS' QUORUM,

04:32.740 --> 04:33.807
AND FATHER OF THE WARD!

04:33.841 --> 04:35.676
- HE'S EVIL.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.778
THAT MAN RIGHT THERE,
HE'S EVIL, I'M TELLING YOU.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.747
- PERHAPS YOU MISTAKE HIM
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.383
- NO, THAT'S HIM.
- WHO GAVE YOU AUTHORITY

04:42.416 --> 04:45.586
TO DIGNIFY
THIS GENTILE'S LIES?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.621
- BUT--
- DO YOU PRESIDE OVER THIS WARD?

04:51.859 --> 04:54.462
THEN YOU SPEAK WHEN SPOKEN TO,
HMM?

04:54.495 --> 04:56.797
GOOD.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.400
BLASPHEMING IN
THE GATHERING PLACE

04:59.433 --> 05:05.072
OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD
IS A CRIME.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.775
HEAVENLY FATHER DECIDES
WHEN A MAN IS

05:07.808 --> 05:11.645
TO BE TAKEN FROM THIS LIFE.

05:11.679 --> 05:15.516
AND BE AWARE, BE ADVISED,

05:15.549 --> 05:18.686
THAT I HAVE BEEN ANOINTED
BY HIM,

05:18.719 --> 05:23.090
AND APPOINTED WITH THE POWER
AND THE KEYS OF THE PRIESTHOOD.

05:23.123 --> 05:28.562
YOUR FATE IS IN MY HANDS.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.102
NOW...

05:35.135 --> 05:40.574
I ASK AGAIN...YOUR NAME?

05:41.942 --> 05:45.613
- YOU KNOW MY NAME.

05:45.646 --> 05:51.485
[indistinct chatter]

05:52.953 --> 05:55.823
- MR. FERGUSON.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.359
ARE YOU HEADING BACK
TO THE CUT?

06:02.596 --> 06:06.400
YOU'RE CHIEF
OF RAILROAD POLICE.

06:06.434 --> 06:10.571
MR. BOHANNON IS GONE.
YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING!

06:10.604 --> 06:12.606
DAMN YOU!

06:15.443 --> 06:18.646
- YOU GOT A MOUTH ON YOU
FOR A CHURCH LADY.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.521
- YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE
AFTER HIM.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.860
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HIS FRIEND.

06:34.995 --> 06:38.766
HOW WILL YOU FEEL
AT HIS FUNERAL?

06:38.799 --> 06:41.669
- AIN'T GONNA BE NO FUNERAL.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.778
- MR. BOHANNON SAT IN MY HOME,

06:50.811 --> 06:53.914
SHARED A MEAL WITH MY FAMILY,

06:53.947 --> 06:57.451
AND THEN TOOK EVERYTHING
WE HAD,

06:57.485 --> 06:59.186
INCLUDING MY SON'S LIFE.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.188
- AFTER YOU MURDERED
MY CHIEF OF POLICE.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.223
- I TOLD YOU,

07:03.256 --> 07:04.558
STAY OFF MY LAND!
- [laughs]

07:04.592 --> 07:06.226
ALL RIGHT, CAN I JUST--

07:06.259 --> 07:10.464
CAN I--DAMN IT!
CAN I TALK?

07:10.498 --> 07:11.765
NOW THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS
I DONE

07:11.799 --> 07:12.866
SHOULD HAVE ENDED IN
A HANGMAN'S NOOSE,

07:12.900 --> 07:16.570
AND THIS AIN'T ONE OF 'EM.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.806
HE AIN'T TOLD YOU
THE WHOLE TRUTH.

07:18.839 --> 07:22.810
- NO, I HAVEN'T.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.845
STAND UP, DAUGHTER.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.719
IS THIS THE MAN
WHO VIOLATED YOU?

07:36.924 --> 07:38.959
- HE IS THE FATHER
OF MY CHILD.

07:43.797 --> 07:47.234
- THIS COUNCIL HAS HEARD ENOUGH.

07:47.267 --> 07:52.806
I WILL DELIBERATE
ON A JUST PUNISHMENT...

07:52.840 --> 07:57.878
AS REVEALED
BY HEAVENLY FATHER.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.499
- THEY HURT YOU BAD?

08:21.301 --> 08:24.805
- NO.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.840
YOU?

08:26.874 --> 08:29.943
- I TOLD THEM I WASN'T FORCED.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.312
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.749
- APPRECIATE THAT.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.885
GUESS IT DON'T MAKE
MUCH DIFFERENCE NOW.

08:37.918 --> 08:41.622
- IT DOES TO ME.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.657
IT WILL TO THIS UNBORN.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.898
I KNOW WHAT
YOU MUST BE THINKING.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.933
THIS CHILD IS YOURS.

09:01.108 --> 09:04.544
- CAN, UM...

09:06.714 --> 09:08.716
MAY I TOUCH IT?

09:32.039 --> 09:34.074
- LATELY, I CAN FEEL IT MOVE.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.088
- EVA!

09:48.121 --> 09:50.858
EVA!

09:50.891 --> 09:53.093
EVA!

09:53.126 --> 09:55.362
- YOU TRYING TO GET ME
THROWN OUT OF HERE?

09:55.395 --> 09:56.997
WHAT YOU DOING
WITH ALL THEM GUNS?

09:57.030 --> 09:59.366
- I THINK THE MORMONS
GOT BOHANNON AT FORT SMITH.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.101
I'M GONNA BUST HIM OUT.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.704
- YOU'RE GOING ALONE
THROUGH INDIAN TERRITORY

10:03.737 --> 10:05.405
TO A MORMON FORT?

10:05.438 --> 10:07.107
THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.076
- IT AIN'T MAKE NO SENSE
FOR HIM TO STOP THE RAILROAD

10:09.109 --> 10:11.879
TO LOOK FOR MY BABY,
BUT HE DONE IT.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.984
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, THEN?

10:17.017 --> 10:21.154
- I JUST WANTED TO SAY...

10:21.188 --> 10:25.726
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU DONE WHAT YOU DONE.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.762
GUESS YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING.

10:33.701 --> 10:37.871
- DON'T GO.

10:37.905 --> 10:41.875
- I GOT TO.

10:41.909 --> 10:46.146
- ELAM.
ELAM!

10:46.179 --> 10:48.849
PLEASE.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.885
I GOT A BAD FEELING.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.154
PLEASE, STAY?

10:54.187 --> 10:56.056
- HYAH!
COME ON!

11:03.130 --> 11:04.832
[indistinct chatter]

11:04.865 --> 11:06.166
- MRS. PALMER, I BELIEVE THIS

11:06.199 --> 11:09.737
TO BE THE FINEST STAIRCASE
IN THE DAKOTA TERRITORY.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.739
- I BELIEVE THIS TO BE
THE ONLY STAIRCASE

11:11.772 --> 11:14.908
IN THE DAKOTA TERRITORY,
MR. DURANT.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.144
- YOU LOOK LIKE A QUEEN.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.179
- AND YOU LOOK LIKE
AN OLD, TICK-FEVERED HOUND.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.815
YOU'VE WON NEW YORK.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.150
WHY SO DOWN IN THE MOUTH?

11:23.183 --> 11:26.920
- I HAVEN'T WON ANYTHING YET.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.122
BOHANNON HAS
AN IRRITATING HABIT

11:29.156 --> 11:32.159
OF SLIPPING OUT
OF TIGHT SPOTS.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.861
- HMM.
[door opens]

11:33.894 --> 11:36.196
- AH!
HMM.

11:36.229 --> 11:40.768
OUR HUMBLE RAILROAD TOWN
HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

11:40.801 --> 11:45.072
GENERAL GRANT, CHAIRMAN AMES,
MISS ELLISON,

11:45.105 --> 11:49.176
MAY I INTRODUCE THE PROPRIETOR
OF THIS FINE ESTABLISHMENT,

11:49.209 --> 11:51.745
MRS. MARGARET PALMER.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.213
- WELCOME TO CHEYENNE,
GENTLEMEN.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.482
- PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,
MRS. PALMER.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.217
- OH, WELL,
THE PLEASURE IS MINE, GENERAL.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.186
I DO HOPE YOUR STAY WITH US
WILL BE COMFORTABLE.

11:59.219 --> 12:04.191
- SO FAR, THERE IS MUCH
TO RECOMMEND IT.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.526
CONGRATULATIONS ON
AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.495
- I HAVE TO HAND IT TO YOU,
THOMAS.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.831
THE TOWN APPEARS
TO BE EVERYTHING YOU PROMISED.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.233
- YES, IF YOU AND BOHANNON
WOULD DISPENSE WITH THE MUTUAL

12:13.266 --> 12:16.169
PETTINESS, YOU MIGHT BE FAVORED
WITH GREATNESS.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.971
- WHERE IS MR. BOHANNON?

12:18.005 --> 12:19.506
- IT'S A FEW HOURS EARLY
FOR HIS DEADLINE,

12:19.539 --> 12:21.875
BUT I HAVE A BOTTLE OF BOURBON

12:21.909 --> 12:23.977
AND A BOX OF CIGARS
I'D LIKE TO OPEN.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.312
- WELL, I'M AFRAID
WE WILL HAVE TO MARK

12:25.345 --> 12:28.281
THIS MILESTONE
WITHOUT MR. BOHANNON.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.083
YOU ALL MISSED
QUITE AN ADVENTURE.

12:30.117 --> 12:34.087
MASKED BANDITS TURNED OUR TOWN
INTO A SHOOTING GALLERY,

12:34.121 --> 12:37.224
BEFORE SNATCHING MR. BOHANNON
AND DRAGGING HIM AWAY.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.558
- WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
GENERAL,

12:38.591 --> 12:40.127
I'LL TELEGRAPH THE FORT
AND ORDER

12:40.160 --> 12:41.995
MORE TROOPS FOR YOUR ESCORT.

12:42.029 --> 12:45.332
- I KILLED ONE OF HIS ABDUCTORS
AT CLOSE RANGE,

12:45.365 --> 12:47.234
AND I ALSO MANAGED
TO SAVE A CHILD.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.837
- WE WERE OUTGUNNED,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.172
WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD
FOR MR. BOHANNON,

12:52.205 --> 12:55.008
EVEN AT GREAT DANGER
TO OURSELVES,

12:55.042 --> 12:57.044
ESPECIALLY MR. DURANT.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.882
NOW LET ME SHOW YOU
TO YOUR ROOM, GENERAL.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.316
AND WHAT CAN I GET YOU
TO DRINK?

13:03.350 --> 13:05.385
- BOURBON, MADAME.
A DOUBLE.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.262
HE HAS UNTIL 6:00.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.797
THERE'S STILL TIME.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.206
- YOU GOT ANY LAST WORDS,
YOU BE A MAN.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.041
SAY 'EM TO ME,
NOT MY DAUGHTER.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.576
YOU DONE ENOUGH TO NAOMI.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.946
- BEEN DOING
SOME HARD THINKING.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.314
I WANNA MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.950
- YOU WERE MY GUEST.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.152
I GAVE YOU SHELTER.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.121
AND YOU REPAID THE KINDNESS

13:41.154 --> 13:43.190
BY STRIPPING
MY MOST BELOVED DAUGHTER

13:43.223 --> 13:45.592
OF HER CHASTITY AND VIRTUE.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.061
NOW SHE'LL LIVE THIS LIFE
IN SHAME

13:48.095 --> 13:50.630
AND SPEND ETERNITY
IN OUTER DARKNESS.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.200
NO GOD-FEARING MAN
WILL HAVE HER.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.169
- I'LL HAVE HER.
I'LL MARRY HER.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.604
IF SHE'LL HAVE ME.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.340
- NO. I WILL NOT
LET HER BE A PARTY

14:00.373 --> 14:03.176
TO YOUR COWARD'S ATTEMPT
TO ESCAPE JUSTICE.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.612
- I AIN'T A COWARD, SIR.

14:05.645 --> 14:09.349
I'M THAT CHILD'S FATHER.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.384
I'LL STAY HERE
AT FORT SMITH

14:11.418 --> 14:12.385
TILL THE CHILD'S BORN
AND OUR FIRST CROPS

14:12.419 --> 14:14.087
ARE IN THE GROUND.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.223
NOW, YOU HAVE MY WORD:

14:16.256 --> 14:19.026
I'LL GIVE THEM A GOOD
AND HONEST LIFE.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.628
I AIN'T NEVER BROKE MY WORD
TO YOU FOR ILL OR NAUGHT,

14:21.661 --> 14:23.897
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

14:23.931 --> 14:27.634
- SHE WAS MY JOY.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.402
SHE COULD HAVE MARRIED
A BISHOP

14:29.436 --> 14:32.005
OR AN APOSTLE.

14:32.039 --> 14:35.008
BRIGHAM YOUNG HIMSELF
WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD

14:35.042 --> 14:38.011
TO CALL HER HIS WIFE.

14:38.045 --> 14:41.014
BUT NOW...

14:41.048 --> 14:45.919
HER ONLY SUITOR
IS A GENTILE.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.955
AND A KILLER.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.898
I WILL SEEK COUNSEL.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.903
BUT THE BISHOP'S WORD
IS FINAL.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.495
- SHIT.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.534
[cocks gun]

15:40.207 --> 15:42.309
HYAH!

15:42.342 --> 15:45.412
[men shouting]

15:51.318 --> 15:54.287
[gunshots]

15:56.156 --> 15:58.491
[gunshots]

16:03.096 --> 16:04.397

- [grunts]

16:08.235 --> 16:10.037
[arrow whizzes, gunshot]

16:12.039 --> 16:13.273
- COME ON!

16:13.306 --> 16:16.076
COME AT ME,
OR GET THE HELL OUT MY WAY.

16:38.498 --> 16:42.169
- I'VE BEEN PRAYING
FOR YOUR SOUL.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.772
- YOU CAN DROP
THE PIOUS BULLSHIT

16:45.805 --> 16:48.141
AND THE PHONY ACCENT.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.143
WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE THAT SWEDISH
SON OF A BITCH,

16:50.177 --> 16:51.278
THOR GUNDERSEN.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.514
- THOR GUNDERSEN
WAS NORWEGIAN.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.117
AND HE WAS A TROUBLED SOUL...

16:57.150 --> 16:59.386
WHO FELL FROM A BRIDGE
IN NEBRASKA.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.553
- NOT FAR ENOUGH.

17:00.587 --> 17:04.157
- AND I AM BISHOP
JOSEPH DUTSON,

17:04.191 --> 17:07.794
REBORN IN THE HOLY
BAPTISMAL WATERS

17:07.827 --> 17:12.465
AND BLESSED WITH THE GIFT
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.268
- YOU'RE A BLOODTHIRSTY
MURDERER.

17:15.302 --> 17:19.439
- YOU ARE NOT WITHOUT SIN...
MR. BOHANNON.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.511
IT DOES NOT MATTER
WHAT YOU BELIEVE.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.347
I AM BISHOP HERE,

17:27.380 --> 17:30.117
AND I HAVE HAD A REVELATION...

17:30.150 --> 17:32.319
ON THE SUBJECT
OF YOUR FATE.

17:37.357 --> 17:40.593
- I AIN'T GONNA HANG, AM I?

17:40.627 --> 17:42.462
- WHAT MAKES YOU
BELIEVE THAT?

17:42.495 --> 17:44.597
THOSE GALLOWS ARE STRONG.

17:44.631 --> 17:49.402
THE ROPE SECURE.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.172
- I'M MARRYING
HATCH'S DAUGHTER.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.307
- I'M THE ARBITER
OF THE LAW HERE,

17:54.341 --> 17:55.875
NOT BROTHER HATCH.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.278
- NO, I'VE SEEN A DOZEN MEN
STAKE THEIR LIVES

17:58.311 --> 18:00.347
ON HIS WORD, NOT YOURS.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.215
BESIDES...

18:02.249 --> 18:03.616
GOT THE FEELING YOU AIN'T
REAL POPULAR AROUND HERE.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.452
- NOW, WHY WOULD YOU
SAY THAT?

18:05.485 --> 18:07.354
- YOU ALWAYS AIN'T POPULAR
WHEREVER YOU TURN UP.

18:07.387 --> 18:10.223
- MY CREDIBILITY HERE
IS MORE SECURE

18:10.257 --> 18:12.459
THAN YOURS HAS EVER BEEN.

18:12.492 --> 18:13.493
- MAYBE.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.128
BUT I GOT THE FEELING

18:15.162 --> 18:17.364
YOU DONE SOMETHING REAL BAD
TO END UP HERE.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.899
TRUTH CAN'T BE FAR BEHIND.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.335
THAT AIN'T THE REAL REASON
YOU AIN'T GONNA HANG ME.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.870
- HMM.

18:23.903 --> 18:27.607
- REAL REASON IS...

18:27.640 --> 18:31.278
YOU CAN ONLY KILL ME ONCE.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.414
THAT AIN'T GONNA BE
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU, IS IT?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.283
YOU'D DRUTHER SEE ME
SUFFER AND DIE,

18:36.316 --> 18:39.252
LITTLE BY LITTLE,
EACH DAY.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.622
- YES.

18:42.655 --> 18:46.259
BUT HEAVENLY FATHER

18:46.293 --> 18:49.396
WISHES TO SEE...
YOU LIVE.

18:51.398 --> 18:54.201
[chuckles]

18:55.702 --> 18:59.272
[laughing]

18:59.306 --> 19:02.342
- MR. CULLEN BOHANNON
IS IN ABSENTIA.

19:02.375 --> 19:06.646

VERY WELL.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.408
THEN THIS WILL BE
THE TERMINUS

19:35.442 --> 19:37.410
OF THE UNION PACIFIC
RAILROAD!

19:37.444 --> 19:40.947
THIS ENTERPRISE

19:40.980 --> 19:42.582

19:47.520 --> 19:49.389

19:49.422 --> 19:51.224
AYE.

19:55.595 --> 20:01.434

20:28.027 --> 20:31.364
[chains clinking]

20:43.643 --> 20:45.778

20:49.382 --> 20:52.018
- DO YOU WANT TO BE MINE?

20:52.051 --> 20:55.588
- YES.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.525
IT'S GOD'S WILL.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.764

21:04.797 --> 21:06.866
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
LET'S DO IT.

AMEN.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.453
[knife being sharpened]

23:25.472 --> 23:27.674
- IT IS A TRADITION

23:27.707 --> 23:30.610
THAT THE GROOM

23:30.643 --> 23:32.845
CARVES THE PIG.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.485
- THAT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.587
- [chuckles]

23:41.888 --> 23:44.924
- NOT BEFORE GRACE.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.760
- OF COURSE.

HEAVENLY FATHER,

23:52.732 --> 23:55.935

24:31.538 --> 24:33.806
- IT'S MY TRADITION

24:33.840 --> 24:36.843
THAT THE MEAT'S CARVED
AT A SIDE TABLE

24:36.876 --> 24:39.679
SO AS NOT TO SOIL
THE LADY'S TABLE LINEN.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.514
- THANK YOU, SON,
FOR YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.883
- YOU WILL CALL HER MOTHER.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.953
AND YOU WILL CALL ME FATHER.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.990
- YES, FATHER.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.542
PIG SKIN'S SLICK.

25:09.576 --> 25:12.278
WOULDN'T STAND TOO CLOSE.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.280
MY HAND MIGHT SLIP THE BLADE
INTO YOUR LIVER.

25:14.313 --> 25:18.284
- YOU'RE A DIFFERENT MAN,
BROTHER BOHANNON...

25:18.317 --> 25:22.855
WITH A NEW WIFE
AND A CHILD ON THE WAY.

25:22.889 --> 25:26.893
- I'M STILL LIABLE TO KILL YOU.
KNOW THAT.

25:26.926 --> 25:31.063
- DON'T YOU THINK IT POSSIBLE
FOR A MAN TO CHANGE?

25:31.097 --> 25:33.099
[knife clinking]
CAN'T YOU BELIEVE...

25:33.132 --> 25:38.838
I AM NOT THE MAN I WAS?

25:38.871 --> 25:42.809
- I DON'T TRUST YOU
FARTHER THAN I CAN SPIT.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.977
- IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT WE CAN CHANGE,

25:45.011 --> 25:49.816
HOW CAN YOU YOURSELF
BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE CHANGED?

25:51.984 --> 25:53.986
IF I'M NOT BISHOP DUTSON,

25:54.020 --> 25:57.724
HOW CAN YOU BE
BROTHER BOHANNON?

25:57.757 --> 26:01.060
NEW SON TO THIS FAMILY,

26:01.093 --> 26:05.064
WHO DID NOT TAKE THAT KNIFE
AND PUT IT INTO MY HEART

26:05.097 --> 26:08.567
THE MOMENT I HANDED IT
TO YOU.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.808
- I MADE A PROMISE.

26:15.842 --> 26:17.810
- THE OLD BOHANNON
WOULDN'T HAVE CARED.

26:17.844 --> 26:22.782
HE WOULD AVENGE THE MURDER
OF MRS. LILY BELL.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.820
- MEAT'S COOLING.
SERVE IT.

[tuba playing]

26:34.894 --> 26:42.902
*

26:46.138 --> 26:49.676
- WHAT IS THAT
INFERNAL NOISE OUTSIDE?

26:49.709 --> 26:51.077
- I'M AFRAID
YOUR CELEBRATORY BAND

26:51.110 --> 26:53.713
CONSISTS OF A SOLITARY
TUBA PLAYER.

26:53.746 --> 26:59.051
- UGH, WILL SOMEONE
PLEASE SHOOT HIM?

[gunshot]

27:00.219 --> 27:01.988
[crowd gasping, tuba clanks]

27:02.021 --> 27:03.790
- YOU KNOW, DURANT,

27:03.823 --> 27:06.025
A POOR WINNER IS UNBECOMING,

27:06.058 --> 27:08.661
REGARDLESS
OF THE BATTLEFIELD.

27:08.695 --> 27:11.063
- [sighs]
ALL I WANT

27:11.097 --> 27:15.702
IS FOR THIS DAY--
THIS HOUR--TO PASS,

27:15.735 --> 27:17.670
SO I CAN RETURN TO BUILDING
MY RAILROAD.

27:17.704 --> 27:19.071
- YOU MEAN THE RAILROAD.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.740
IN THE MEANTIME,
IT'S GOOD FORM

27:20.773 --> 27:22.742
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIVALS
WHO KNOCK OFF

27:22.775 --> 27:25.044
OUR ROUGH EDGES...

27:25.077 --> 27:27.146
AND SHAPE US.

27:27.179 --> 27:32.752
- DO YOU MEAN BOHANNON?

27:32.785 --> 27:34.754
BARKEEP!

27:37.924 --> 27:40.192
I WAS PLANNING A TOAST
ALL ALONG,

27:40.226 --> 27:43.195
BUT SINCE YOU INSIST.

27:48.134 --> 27:53.139
TO YOUR WORTHY WAR ENEMY...

27:53.172 --> 27:56.042
WHO CHAMPIONED THE CAUSE
OF HUMAN BONDAGE

27:56.075 --> 27:58.811
THAT TORE THIS NATION APART

27:58.845 --> 28:02.815
AND KILLED
MANY FINE YOUNG MEN.

28:06.986 --> 28:10.056
AHH.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.958
[slams shot glass on table]

28:13.960 --> 28:17.864
TO YOUR SAVIOR
OF THE RAILROAD,

28:17.897 --> 28:20.967
WHOSE ANTICS
HAVE PUT HUNTINGTON AHEAD

28:21.000 --> 28:22.802
AND US BEHIND IN THIS,

28:22.835 --> 28:27.039
THE GREATEST RACE
OF MODERN TIMES.

28:34.814 --> 28:38.851
TO YOUR MAN OF INTEGRITY,

28:38.885 --> 28:42.188
AS YOU CALL HIM
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.

28:42.221 --> 28:45.758
APPARENTLY, HIS INTEGRITY

28:45.792 --> 28:47.226
HAS LOST HIM HIS LIFE

28:47.259 --> 28:51.097
TO MEN WHO TOOK EXCEPTION
WITH HIS INTEGRITY.

28:51.130 --> 28:56.168
- I TAKE EXCEPTION
TO THE SINCERITY OF THIS TOAST.

28:59.271 --> 29:02.241
- TO CULLEN BOHANNON, THEN.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.845
MAY GOD SPEED HIM
TO HIS JUST DESSERTS.

29:05.878 --> 29:08.214
AND TO US.

29:08.247 --> 29:13.886
MAY GOD BLESS US ALL
AS WE DRIVE OUR STEEL FORWARD

31:10.669 --> 31:12.404
19 NEXT MONTH.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.309

THIS IS HOW YOU FIGURED

31:17.343 --> 31:20.980
ON SPENDING
YOUR WEDDING NIGHT.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.448
- MOTHER SAID
NOBODY'D WANT ME

31:22.481 --> 31:26.285
SINCE I WAS UNCHASTE.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.354
NEVER THOUGHT I'D EVEN HAVE
A WEDDING NIGHT.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.289
- [grunts]

31:30.322 --> 31:32.925
NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE
MORE THAN ONE MYSELF.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.071
- WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

31:49.441 --> 31:54.013
- MM, IT'S WHAT YOU
COULD IMAGINE, I SUPPOSE.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.015
GOT MARRIED IN A BIG CHURCH
IN NEW YORK

31:56.048 --> 31:57.349
AND THEN TOOK A TRIP
UP TO THE MOUNTAINS.

31:57.383 --> 32:00.452
- NO, THE--
THE WEDDING NIGHT.

32:04.290 --> 32:06.325
- THAT'S KIND OF PERSONAL.

32:08.327 --> 32:11.430
- YOU'RE MY HUSBAND.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.465
- YEAH.

32:16.368 --> 32:19.205
WELL...

32:21.307 --> 32:23.375
FOR ONE THING, WE HAD--

32:23.409 --> 32:28.014
HADN'T BEEN CHASTE
ABOUT IT.

32:28.047 --> 32:31.083
- THAT'S A SIN.

- YEAH.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.288
MARY WAS A LOT OF FUN.

ONCE YOU CAN?

32:44.763 --> 32:46.498
- NO.

32:50.236 --> 32:54.073
I AIN'T LIKE THAT.

32:54.106 --> 32:57.209

- SEEM TO RECALL US
HAVING FUN IN THAT BARN.

33:04.183 --> 33:07.986

ANYMORE TO YOU?
