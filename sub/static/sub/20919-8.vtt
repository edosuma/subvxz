WEBVTT

00:04.086 --> 00:05.531
[weapons firing] [Hawkeye] What
kind of morons try to hide

00:05.555 --> 00:06.741
a secret base
underneath Manhattan?

00:06.765 --> 00:09.516
[grunts]

00:09.551 --> 00:12.794
[grunting]

00:15.224 --> 00:17.991
Hydra really needs to get
a new playbook. [Groans]

00:18.027 --> 00:19.176
Seriously.

00:21.296 --> 00:22.620
Aah! [Grunts]

00:22.656 --> 00:25.298
[grunts] [groans]

00:25.334 --> 00:29.678
You're slipping, Avenger! Hail Hydra!
Hail... [yells]

00:29.713 --> 00:31.457
Man, they love to talk. [Captain
America] Stay focused, Hawkeye.

00:31.481 --> 00:34.232
Overconfidence loses battles.
[grunting]

00:35.611 --> 00:37.160
[crying out]

00:37.195 --> 00:38.478
[all shouting] [Hulk grunts]

00:38.513 --> 00:40.580
[roars]

00:40.616 --> 00:42.657
[exclaiming]

00:42.692 --> 00:45.927
If this lousy base makes me
miss Halloween tonight,

00:45.963 --> 00:48.655
I'm gonna take it out
on every Hydra goon here.

00:48.690 --> 00:50.832
The base isn't the mission,
Hulk.

00:50.867 --> 00:52.876
We're here for the scientist.
Fan out and find her.

01:00.953 --> 01:03.519
Well, well, well.
One evil Hydra scientist,

01:03.555 --> 01:08.516
one awesome superhero and...
oh, look... a bunch of arrows.

01:08.552 --> 01:09.832
Looks like
I got you outnumbered.

01:11.647 --> 01:12.854
Count again.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.030
I never was that good at math.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074

01:37.864 --> 01:39.297
[grunts]

01:42.677 --> 01:45.979
Okay, that is not good.

01:46.056 --> 01:49.299
On the contrary. These are
the Mark II prototypes,

01:49.334 --> 01:51.193
designed with the Avengers
in mind.

01:51.228 --> 01:55.113
You and your little bow
are outmatched.

01:55.149 --> 01:58.241
Prototypes, huh? As in, not
quite ready for prime time?

01:58.276 --> 01:59.276
I can work with that.

02:03.015 --> 02:05.048
And it's not about
the bow, lady.

02:05.084 --> 02:08.151
The name's not Hawk-bow,
it's Hawk-eye!

02:08.186 --> 02:10.863
[grunts]

02:10.898 --> 02:14.082
As in, eyes always on the prize.

02:18.396 --> 02:22.199
You are caught,
evil genius lady.

02:22.234 --> 02:25.402
Okay, team. Our Hydra scientist's
name is Whitney Frost.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.663
Dr. Frost, why don't you tell us
what you've been doing here?

02:28.698 --> 02:30.990
I do many things,
Captain America.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.360
You have to be more specific.

02:33.437 --> 02:36.546
Your experiments with vampires...
specifically.

02:36.582 --> 02:38.498
[scoffs] Vampires?

02:38.534 --> 02:39.660
As if I didn't already
hate Halloween.

02:39.684 --> 02:42.652
Hydra soldiers aren't able to do
what we need them to.

02:42.687 --> 02:48.075
But with vampire powers...
Strength, vision, speed...

02:48.110 --> 02:50.986
Once I stabilize the serum, we will
have an army of super-soldiers.

02:51.021 --> 02:52.628
That's not going to happen.

02:52.664 --> 02:55.815
Iron Man, wipe Hydra's computers.
Delete everything they know.

02:55.850 --> 02:57.326
Consider it done. [Beeps]

02:57.361 --> 02:58.961
The formula's
not in the computers,

02:58.996 --> 03:00.712
it's in my head.

03:03.208 --> 03:06.334
If you were
all that smart, Frost,

03:06.369 --> 03:09.257
then you'd know vampires really don't
like humans messing with their stuff.

03:09.281 --> 03:10.555
[vampires hissing]

03:14.528 --> 03:15.528
[grunting]

03:17.598 --> 03:18.647
[Hulk grunts]

03:20.559 --> 03:22.609
The vampires are after me?

03:22.644 --> 03:24.277
Hey, ya think?

03:27.007 --> 03:29.599
The team and I
will hold them off.

03:29.634 --> 03:32.852
Hawkeye, get her out of here
and take her to the Beach House.

03:32.887 --> 03:35.638
What? No.
I hate the Beach House.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.607
It's the safest place.
The Beach House, Hawkeye.

03:37.643 --> 03:38.833
Go! Now!

03:40.303 --> 03:41.378
[grunts] Let's go.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.571
This is your idea
of keeping me safe?

03:51.607 --> 03:54.741
[chuckling] Oh, no. None
of this was my idea.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.057
And I'll keep you safe, but I
ain't promising comfortable.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.691
Hey, guess who I stole
the web arrow idea from.

04:02.726 --> 04:05.018
Come on. Guess.

04:05.053 --> 04:06.133
That's not gonna stop them.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.691
[hissing, snarling]

04:11.727 --> 04:14.119
Doesn't need to stop 'em.
Just needs to slow 'em down.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.189
Ha-ha! Hydra cycles.

04:18.224 --> 04:19.874
I am great at Hydra cycles.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.532
Of all the Avengers to get
stuck with, I get you.

04:27.567 --> 04:31.269
Not Iron Man, not Hulk...
Whoa. The Hulk? Really?

04:31.304 --> 04:33.413
You'd choose him over me?
Wow. That is...

04:33.448 --> 04:35.515
That is just harsh.
[vampires hissing, snarling]

04:38.169 --> 04:40.586
Frost, think fast.

04:40.622 --> 04:42.355
[grunts]

04:46.220 --> 04:48.061
Listen up. One:
The other Avengers are busy

04:48.096 --> 04:50.188
holding off the vampires
for you.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.131
Two: You don't get
a vote because...

04:52.167 --> 04:54.226
Wait for it... you're evil.

04:54.261 --> 04:57.011
And three: There's a good reason
Cap picked me.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.481
And that is? I know where
the Beach House is.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.356
[hissing, snarling continue]
[tires screeching]

05:13.113 --> 05:15.396
[birds twittering]

05:15.431 --> 05:19.000
This is the Beach House?

05:19.036 --> 05:23.997
Um, hi. It's a code name. All our
safe houses have code names,

05:24.032 --> 05:27.112
because no one would think to look for a
beach house here in Rutland, Vermont.

05:30.171 --> 05:33.398
Don't worry.
This place has everything.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.493
Perimeter defense array,
canons, cameras, shielding.

05:36.528 --> 05:40.246
Even one of those fancy
single-serving coffee machines.

05:40.282 --> 05:42.181
Yeah.
Keeps trick-or-treaters out.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.776
Keeps wacky evil geniuses in.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.778
Enough security
to hold off the Hulk.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.696
It's not the Hulk
who worries me.

05:48.731 --> 05:50.507
It's what comes after dark.

05:57.416 --> 05:59.093
House, get me a location
on Captain America.

05:59.117 --> 06:01.667
And give me my backup quiver.

06:01.703 --> 06:04.629
This is so unfair.

06:04.664 --> 06:07.607
The Avengers have all this
but don't do anything with it.

06:07.642 --> 06:09.926
At least Hydra tries
to change the world.

06:09.961 --> 06:14.222
No. Hydra wants
to own the world.

06:14.258 --> 06:17.098
The Avengers save the world. You're a
genius, Frost. You know I'm right.

06:19.521 --> 06:21.988
No response from Cap? House,
try him again. [Beeps]

06:22.023 --> 06:24.457
[soft electrical buzzing]

06:27.095 --> 06:29.838
[beeping]

06:29.873 --> 06:32.699
[buzzing stops]

06:32.734 --> 06:36.119
The vampires got him.
It's the only answer.

06:36.154 --> 06:38.396
The vampires didn't get him.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.865
House, give me a location
on Black Widow.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.001
[beeping] That's impossible.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.519
According to this,
Black Widow's here.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.484
Hey, Hawkeye,
wanna come out and play?

06:51.520 --> 06:54.329
Crossbones
and the Crimson Widow.

06:54.364 --> 06:57.965
Look at this.
They sent us to fetch Frost,

06:58.001 --> 07:00.176
but looks like we get
to hurt Hawkeye.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.979
Bonus. Barely half an Avenger.

07:03.014 --> 07:06.349
So dull. I wanted Romanov.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.909
Aw, you're not getting
what you want.

07:08.945 --> 07:10.896
But you'll get the butt-kicking
you deserve.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.715
[grunts] [groaning]

07:15.326 --> 07:17.635
House, emergency lockdown!

07:19.806 --> 07:21.764
[Yelena] So careless, Hawkeye,

07:21.799 --> 07:24.742
forgetting to disable
to bike's tracker.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.879
Frost, make yourself useful
and open the doors.

07:28.915 --> 07:29.755
[beeping]

07:29.791 --> 07:31.566
[yells]

07:32.911 --> 07:34.444
[chuckling]

07:36.981 --> 07:38.661
[grunting] [Hawkeye]
What, leaving so soon?

07:44.864 --> 07:46.890
Uh-oh.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.783
[cries out]

07:48.818 --> 07:50.384
[grunts]

07:50.420 --> 07:51.586
[straining]

07:55.434 --> 07:59.102
[grunts] You waste your time, Hawkeye.
[grunts]

07:59.137 --> 08:01.412
I disabled your
defensive weapons systems.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.564
Yeah. And I just reset 'em.

08:03.599 --> 08:05.575
House, target hostiles.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.885
[whirring]

08:06.920 --> 08:08.903
[knocking on door]

08:08.938 --> 08:10.905
You expecting somebody?

08:10.940 --> 08:12.941
Frost, open the shields.

08:15.219 --> 08:17.211
[knocking on door]

08:17.247 --> 08:18.571
[Hawkeye] Nobody's there.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.700
[vampires snarling]

08:26.681 --> 08:28.022
[gasps]

08:28.058 --> 08:29.541
Dracula.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.542
Good evening.

08:31.577 --> 08:32.921
What is that quaint
Western expression?

08:32.945 --> 08:34.379
Oh, yes.

08:34.414 --> 08:37.256
Trick or treat.

08:41.638 --> 08:44.113
[Dracula] Dracula is not
here for you, Avenger,

08:44.149 --> 08:46.908
and not for these
Hydra fools, either.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.601
I have come for her.

08:49.921 --> 08:52.380
[gasps]

08:52.415 --> 08:55.950
She has meddled in the
affairs of the vampires.

08:55.985 --> 08:58.603
She must be chastised.
[vampires snarling]

08:58.638 --> 09:02.282
Hand her over to me now, and
perhaps I will allow you to live.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.112
[chuckles]
Yeah, that's not happening.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.338
No chastising tonight,
tooth boy.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.541
"Tooth boy"?

09:11.576 --> 09:13.651
Have you just called
the immortal Dracula,

09:13.686 --> 09:17.422
lord of all vampires,
"tooth boy"?

09:17.457 --> 09:20.792
I know the rules, Drac.
This is my house.

09:20.827 --> 09:24.612
You and the bite brigade can't set
one toe in here unless I invite you.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.923
And guess what. [Chuckling]
You are so not invited.

09:26.958 --> 09:32.987
And what will you say when there
is no house in which to invite me?

09:33.022 --> 09:36.875
What Dracula desires,
Dracula will have.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.953
Tear the house down!

09:39.988 --> 09:42.872
The woman will suffer our wrath!

09:42.949 --> 09:45.742
The others will suffer death!
[snarling continues]

09:52.776 --> 09:55.134
I thought you said this place
could hold off the Hulk.

09:55.169 --> 09:57.203
Well, yeah. It can see the Hulk.

09:57.238 --> 09:59.205
But vampires are invisible
to tech.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.640
House can't fight
what it can't see.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.920
We're stuck in here.
What are we supposed to do?

10:05.956 --> 10:07.922
Get to the middle of the cabin.
It's our best bet.

10:07.958 --> 10:09.143
We have to hold them off
as long as we can.

10:09.167 --> 10:13.753
"We"? What makes you think
we'd work with the likes of you?

10:13.788 --> 10:16.147
Because your lives
are on the line here too.

10:16.182 --> 10:19.267
We team up and eventually
walk out of here alive.

10:19.302 --> 10:22.344
Or do you wanna do your own
thing, and we all get wiped out?

10:22.380 --> 10:24.881
[snarling]

10:24.916 --> 10:27.383
Ugh! Fine.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.535
We team up.

10:32.123 --> 10:34.082
[grunts] Then let's do this.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.216
It's like whack-a-mole
with vampires.

10:45.587 --> 10:47.528
Still fighting?

10:47.564 --> 10:50.248
It will only make
our victory sweeter

10:50.283 --> 10:52.726
when I hold your lifeless...

10:52.761 --> 10:54.335
Huh? [Grunts]

10:54.371 --> 10:55.895
[growls]

10:59.910 --> 11:02.501
I thought you knew
the rules, bowman.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.404
Your metal arrows
can do nothing to...

11:10.137 --> 11:13.888
So be it, bowman.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.457
[vampires snarling]
[sirens wailing]

11:15.492 --> 11:16.641
[Hulk roaring]

11:16.676 --> 11:19.711
[grunting]

11:24.684 --> 11:26.128
[Captain America]
Hulk, watch your six!

11:26.152 --> 11:28.544
[hissing]

11:28.579 --> 11:33.116
I'm gonna miss trick or treat because
of vampires wrecking my Halloween!

11:33.151 --> 11:35.051
[snarling]

11:35.086 --> 11:37.311
[roars]

11:39.073 --> 11:41.441
[grunting]

11:43.620 --> 11:45.620
Well, maybe we can start
a new tradition.

11:45.655 --> 11:47.175
Smashoween.
What do you think, big guy?

11:48.558 --> 11:50.700
"Smashoween"? I like it.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.086
Hee-hee-hee.

11:57.658 --> 12:00.126
That didn't feel like a retreat.
Then what was it?

12:00.162 --> 12:01.544
That felt like
they got new orders.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.565
Boo.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.677
One more surge,
and the cabin will fall.

12:21.224 --> 12:23.983
I thought you said the house
couldn't see vampires.

12:24.018 --> 12:27.036
It can't. So I set the
firing pattern to "random."

12:27.071 --> 12:28.071
I'm a genius, remember?

12:33.861 --> 12:35.811
The house defense system
just went down.

12:35.846 --> 12:37.263
Someone must've
tampered with it.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.498
It was Crimson Widow.

12:39.534 --> 12:41.333
She sabotaged
the systems earlier.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.169
And you helped me do it.

12:47.325 --> 12:49.792
[sighs] This is pointless.

12:49.828 --> 12:53.772
We can't hold out forever.
The vamps don't even want us.

12:53.848 --> 12:56.566
Maybe we could just finish
these two off and bail.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.184
Hydra sent you to rescue me!

13:00.204 --> 13:02.213
You're not an asset anymore.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.040
You're a liability.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.943
Hydra cuts its losses when necessary.
[knocking on door]

13:09.013 --> 13:11.539
[Hawkeye] Who wants to answer that?
Anyone?

13:11.574 --> 13:13.241
[sighs] Man, I do
everything around here.

13:17.822 --> 13:21.174
Dracula's patience
is at an end, bowman.

13:21.251 --> 13:24.385
I should slay each of you,
but I'm not going to.

13:24.421 --> 13:26.295
You're not?

13:26.331 --> 13:29.057
I'm offering you a deal.

13:29.059 --> 13:32.626
You three are free to go
and will not be harmed.

13:32.662 --> 13:36.655
As lord of all vampires,
you have my word.

13:36.691 --> 13:39.183
All I want is the Frost woman.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.535
Nothing's changed, Drac.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.646
You're out there,
and we're in here.

13:43.681 --> 13:45.481
The four of us can take
anything you got.

13:45.516 --> 13:47.191
The four of you?

13:49.204 --> 13:52.988
[chuckles] Cutting losses.

13:53.024 --> 13:55.174
You know,
kind of saw that coming.

13:55.210 --> 13:58.168
You should have taken my offer.

13:58.204 --> 14:01.230
My forces are replenished now,
while yours are at low ebb.

14:01.266 --> 14:05.192
Breathe your last among the
living, and then join the undead.

14:05.228 --> 14:07.086
[hissing, snarling]

14:07.121 --> 14:11.181
This was Captain America's
plan all along.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.910
Sacrifice me and the weakest
Avenger to save Manhattan.

14:13.945 --> 14:17.605
Um, words hurt.
Besides, that's Hydra thinking.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.074
Avengers find a way.
There's always a way.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.934
[snarling continues]

14:28.092 --> 14:32.127
The house is no more.
Leave the woman to me,

14:32.163 --> 14:33.832
and dispose of the bowman.
[hissing, snarling]

14:33.856 --> 14:35.797
Do something.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.043
Use your arrows or something.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.978
Frost, you are a genius.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.079
House, cozy fire.

14:48.003 --> 14:49.420
Have you lost your mind?

14:49.455 --> 14:51.280
Yeah, probably.

14:51.315 --> 14:52.798
[hissing, snarling continue]

14:54.535 --> 14:55.535
Hawkeye!

15:01.101 --> 15:02.767
[screeching]

15:13.930 --> 15:15.049
[Dracula] Unexpected. [Hisses]

15:15.073 --> 15:19.751
I had not thought to see
an Avenger show such steel.

15:19.786 --> 15:22.761
If your spirit
yet lingers here, bowman,

15:22.797 --> 15:25.039
know that you have
the respect of...

15:27.626 --> 15:30.044
Bowman! [Echoing]

15:34.642 --> 15:37.593
I mean, why is it so hard for
these people to remember my name?

15:37.629 --> 15:40.079
This is no time for jokes.

15:40.114 --> 15:42.156
Well, actually,
it's the perfect time for jokes.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.750
[vampires snarling] You ever
hear the one about the...

15:44.785 --> 15:46.727
Ugh! How can you be so flip?

15:46.763 --> 15:49.088
We're in the middle of a forest.

15:49.123 --> 15:51.076
You're only as good as your
arrows, which you blew up!

15:51.100 --> 15:52.302
Yeah, when you put it that way,
it sounds pretty bad.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.326
[hissing]

15:57.640 --> 15:58.640
Move! [Grunts]

16:00.493 --> 16:01.967
There are more coming.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.523
[grunting]
[vampires hissing, snarling]

16:04.839 --> 16:06.438
[screeching]

16:06.474 --> 16:09.157
Ha-ha! See? Wood.

16:09.193 --> 16:11.861
It's the one thing
vampires really can't stand,

16:11.896 --> 16:14.413
and we are in the middle
of a forest.

16:14.449 --> 16:17.383
I told you, I know the rules.
I have a plan.

16:17.418 --> 16:19.268
But you won't be able
to stop them all.

16:19.303 --> 16:21.412
Man, did Hydra
just give you a big ol' bag

16:21.447 --> 16:22.716
of "I give up"
when they recruited you?

16:22.740 --> 16:23.740
Come on.

16:26.285 --> 16:29.353
I am coming for you, bowman!

16:32.467 --> 16:33.867
[vampires hissing, snarling]
[gasps]

16:35.553 --> 16:37.478
Ca... Can we call for help?

16:37.513 --> 16:38.648
[Hawkeye] Tried that. No signal.

16:38.672 --> 16:40.814
What are you doing up there?

16:40.850 --> 16:44.168
They'll catch us if we don't...
keep moving.

16:44.203 --> 16:47.929
Hawkeye, they found me!

16:47.965 --> 16:50.691
[grunts] [snarling continues]

16:50.727 --> 16:52.251
[grunts]

16:54.055 --> 16:55.087
[grunting]

16:56.941 --> 16:58.299
Hawkeye!

17:01.520 --> 17:03.262
[panting]

17:05.066 --> 17:06.690
What took you so long?

17:06.724 --> 17:09.852
I had it under control.

17:09.887 --> 17:12.438
Anyway, I had to finish
collecting these.

17:12.473 --> 17:16.375
What's the use? Hydra abandoned us
out here, and so did your Avengers.

17:16.411 --> 17:20.320
Whoa. Avengers never
abandon anyone.

17:20.356 --> 17:23.273
Even you. Now, you can
keep being Queen Snarky,

17:23.309 --> 17:25.829
or you can help me find something
to make a string for this bow.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.618
Is it all right
to say that I'm scared?

17:33.653 --> 17:36.137
Be stupid if you weren't.

17:36.172 --> 17:39.690
Last I heard, you're a genius.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.733
We're getting out of this.
I promise.

17:41.769 --> 17:45.721
That, I'm afraid, is not true.

17:48.626 --> 17:52.937
A wooden bow and arrow?
[laughing]

17:52.972 --> 17:55.931
Wooden stakes. Through the heart.
I know the rules.

17:55.966 --> 17:59.268
[grunts] No.

17:59.304 --> 18:03.756
Wood may hurt my minions,
but I am the immortal Dracula.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.574
You cannot hurt me.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.286
[grunting]

18:11.206 --> 18:13.057
[grunts] Get them!

18:13.092 --> 18:14.750
[hissing, snarling]

18:21.158 --> 18:22.158
Duck! [Grunts]

18:25.387 --> 18:27.063
Tell me you have enough arrows.

18:27.098 --> 18:29.231
I could tell you that,
but I'd be lying.

18:29.266 --> 18:32.034
I am trusting
that you have a plan here.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.736
[hissing] [grunts]

18:33.771 --> 18:35.704
[gasps] [laughing]

18:35.739 --> 18:36.972
[hissing]

18:37.007 --> 18:38.007
[yells]

18:38.042 --> 18:40.425
[grunting]

18:40.461 --> 18:42.111
[yells]

18:43.806 --> 18:45.397
[pants]

18:45.432 --> 18:46.899
Thanks, Hawkeye.

18:46.934 --> 18:50.285
[sighs] Finally,

18:50.320 --> 18:52.080
somebody gets my name right.
[wind whooshing]

18:56.803 --> 18:59.678
No more arrows. No more running.

18:59.713 --> 19:01.722
What will you do now?

19:01.724 --> 19:04.817
Perhaps you think you have
one last effort in you,

19:04.853 --> 19:08.103
[hissing] some way you
can still save yourself.

19:08.139 --> 19:10.147
I think not.

19:10.182 --> 19:13.968
Your life ends here,
alone in the dark.

19:14.003 --> 19:17.563
It's not about me.
It was about her.

19:17.598 --> 19:21.091
Keeping her safe,
and running out the clock.

19:21.126 --> 19:22.951
Dawn around here
is about 7:00 a.m.,

19:22.986 --> 19:26.505
which is just about...

19:26.541 --> 19:29.416
[gasps] The sun!
[flesh sizzling]

19:29.452 --> 19:30.743
[screeching]

19:34.007 --> 19:36.974
Right on time.
Told you I know the rules.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.335
You have made an enemy
today, bowman.

19:39.370 --> 19:41.812
Mark my words.

19:41.848 --> 19:45.107
Dracula will have his vengeance!

19:45.142 --> 19:49.152
Yeah, yeah, yeah. If I had a nickel
for every vampire who said that.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.098
[whooshing]
What is it? More vampires?

19:52.133 --> 19:54.516
Huh. Not quite.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.395
Hey, Hawkeye, lose these?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.859
Looks like Hawkeye
had quite the night.

20:03.895 --> 20:06.095
You did okay back there.

20:06.130 --> 20:09.089
For an evil Hydra genius.
[chuckles]

20:09.125 --> 20:12.593
Well, yeah. That too.
Listen, Frost...

20:12.628 --> 20:15.462
You're going to point out that Hydra
was gonna let Dracula take me.

20:15.497 --> 20:17.431
But you, the weakest Avenger...

20:17.466 --> 20:19.049
Watch it.

20:19.084 --> 20:22.469
You protected me until the end.

20:22.505 --> 20:25.756
All I'm saying is, just make
sure you're on the right side.

20:27.384 --> 20:29.293
Change the world or break it.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.704
Thanks, Hawkeye.

20:31.739 --> 20:33.305
You've given me
a lot to think about.

20:40.248 --> 20:41.438
[grunts]

20:52.560 --> 20:55.068
Only five targets
with three arrows?

20:55.104 --> 20:57.730
Never seen you so off.
Something on your mind?

20:57.765 --> 21:00.432
Oh, Whitney Frost just got
in my head a little.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.451
You didn't send us
to the Beach House

21:02.486 --> 21:04.945
because I'm
the weak link, did ya?

21:04.980 --> 21:07.223
Like the expendable Avenger?

21:07.300 --> 21:10.626
Clint, you're the most
resourceful man I've ever met.

21:10.661 --> 21:12.428
I sent you
with that Hydra scientist

21:12.463 --> 21:15.597
because I knew if there was a way to
keep her safe, you would find it.

21:15.633 --> 21:17.824
[snarling]
You always find a way.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.793
Blood! Blood! Aah! Vampire!

21:19.829 --> 21:20.936
No, Hawkeye, wait!

21:24.117 --> 21:27.342
Hawkeye, that was
my favorite costume!

21:27.378 --> 21:29.695
[roars] You see?

21:29.731 --> 21:37.731
This is why I hate Halloween!
