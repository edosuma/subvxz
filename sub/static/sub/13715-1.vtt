04:49.178 --> 04:53.146
Dr. Powell, I'm Tom Hanley, U.S.
State Department.

04:53.148 --> 04:57.216
Take the chains off.
He's ours now.

05:18.271 --> 05:22.873
<i>If you have knowledge of a crime, why
don't you go to the police, Annie?</i>

05:22.875 --> 05:25.542
The police are probably
in on it.

05:25.544 --> 05:28.912
You don't know anything
about politics, do you?

05:28.914 --> 05:33.182
You're just a psychiatrist.
You're not versed in this.

05:33.751 --> 05:35.951
Well, I wanna learn.

05:35.953 --> 05:38.119
I wanna know why someone
would wanna kidnap the pope.

05:38.121 --> 05:42.756
<i>I don't want to sit here and have you
try to tell me that this isn't true.</i>

05:42.758 --> 05:44.691
I just... Does it scare you?

05:44.693 --> 05:46.726
The thought that it
might not be true?

05:46.728 --> 05:51.931
No! It doesn't scare me,
because it is true.

05:51.933 --> 05:53.832
They took him seven weeks ago.

05:53.834 --> 05:55.567
They're keeping him on Corsica.

05:55.569 --> 05:58.202
They don't want people
to know that he's missing.

05:58.204 --> 06:04.341
And you're probably gonna say, "Why
Corsica?" No, Corsica makes sense.

06:04.543 --> 06:08.344
Good. Good. <i> It's a
straight shot west of Rome,</i>

06:08.346 --> 06:09.945
<i>about 150 miles.</i>

06:09.947 --> 06:15.617
- Have you ever been there?
- No. But it's on my list.

06:21.291 --> 06:25.226
He's made a partner of her.
You see?

06:28.331 --> 06:33.967
<i>Now, Annie, I want to explore</i>
<i>every possibility.</i>

06:34.970 --> 06:38.972
<i>Now, on the other side</i>
<i>of this page, is it possible...</i>

06:38.974 --> 06:41.708
that this is a photo
of the pope?

06:41.910 --> 06:47.079
Well, it's possible, yeah.

06:47.081 --> 06:48.914
I mean, is it?

06:48.916 --> 06:50.582
Well, I'm just saying,

06:50.584 --> 06:55.153
is it possible that this is a photo of
the pope, taken only eight days ago,

06:55.155 --> 06:57.221
showing him safe in Rome? No!

06:57.223 --> 06:59.957
Has anyone seen that magazine?
Catherine. Catherine.

06:59.959 --> 07:01.992
We're just exploring here,
Annie.

07:01.994 --> 07:05.628
We're just saying...
It's not what you say.

07:06.964 --> 07:09.397
L-Let me see.

07:19.909 --> 07:23.744
Oh, I...

07:23.746 --> 07:26.680
Oh, I don't know.

07:29.351 --> 07:32.051
Very good.

07:32.053 --> 07:33.018
I... I don't...

07:33.020 --> 07:39.491
<i>If you're afraid, then at least you're aware
of the possibility that you might be ill.</i>

07:45.498 --> 07:47.664
Shouldn't he hold her?

07:47.666 --> 07:49.298
Don't get motherly, Gilbert.

07:49.300 --> 07:52.601
We'll discuss notes
this afternoon.

07:57.373 --> 07:58.605
You're late. I was just...

07:58.607 --> 08:04.544
I need you to take my 10:00 class on Wednesday.
Let me see that photo.

08:11.819 --> 08:14.219
That's risky, Theo.

08:14.221 --> 08:15.053
Very risky.

08:15.055 --> 08:20.291
I've been asked to do the evaluation of Ethan Powell.
You remember who he is?

08:20.293 --> 08:22.293
He used to work here.
Anthropology.

08:22.295 --> 08:24.428
Disappeared in Africa.
Killed people.

08:24.430 --> 08:26.696
Yeah, a year ago. Two dead,
three in the hospital.

08:26.698 --> 08:29.098
Mad as a three-cornered hat,
but he's coming home.

08:29.100 --> 08:32.900
We wouldn't want one of our former
professors hanged in Rwanda...

08:32.903 --> 08:36.471
bad press...
so he's coming home.

08:36.472 --> 08:39.841
And the evaluation begins as
soon as he arrives. Which is?

08:39.842 --> 08:44.178
Tomorrow. I need to know everything
about the case in 24 hours,

08:44.179 --> 08:48.982
and I want the research done
by my very best resident.

08:49.951 --> 08:52.918
Ben, that's three-day's work
packed in the next 24 hours.

08:52.920 --> 08:57.589
Well, I guess I wasn't talking about you.
I must've meant Gilbert.

08:58.091 --> 09:00.124
Have him call me at home.

09:00.126 --> 09:02.493
Okay. All right.
Okay. All right, Ben.

09:02.495 --> 09:07.364
Ben, I would be glad
to do the research.

09:07.366 --> 09:10.367
Only if you can handle it.
I can handle it.

09:10.369 --> 09:14.504
That was too easy, Theo.
All right.

09:14.506 --> 09:17.673
This time tomorrow
in my office.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.766
It's locked. Aw, come on!

09:47.768 --> 09:51.669
<i>What?</i> Wait...

09:53.506 --> 09:58.175
Good. Good. You know, I told you
it was the one on the left.

09:58.177 --> 10:00.944
- It's locked!
- It's supposed to be open.

10:00.946 --> 10:02.912
Maxwell, do you copy us?

10:02.914 --> 10:04.546
Come in, Maxwell. Come again.

10:04.548 --> 10:07.348
Maxwell, come in. We're in
the corridor with the Doctor.

10:07.350 --> 10:10.284
- Is it the door on the east or the west side?
- What was that?

10:10.286 --> 10:13.587
- Are you reading this?
- Is something wrong? - No, I didn't copy.

10:13.589 --> 10:15.589
- Is something wrong?
- Mom. Shh. -<i> Foley!</i>

10:15.591 --> 10:18.425
I'm goin' to check this out.

10:18.427 --> 10:20.059
Just relax, all right?

10:20.061 --> 10:23.595
<i>Maxwell, you pickin' this up?</i>

10:23.997 --> 10:27.231
Max. Hey, Doc.

10:29.335 --> 10:32.002
Foley! Stop!

10:38.176 --> 10:40.042
- Foley.
- <i> Get the family out!</i>

10:40.044 --> 10:43.245
Uh, ladies, we need to get
you out of here. What?

10:43.247 --> 10:44.713
Just come with me, please.
What happened?

10:44.715 --> 10:49.451
You know as much as I know at this point.
Let's... This way, please.

11:06.236 --> 11:09.437
Ahh!

12:24.340 --> 12:27.974
<i>It's what the Rwandan
papers called him.</i> Theo.

12:27.976 --> 12:31.811
It's not like any other case, Ben.
Ever.

12:31.813 --> 12:35.748
- You're three hours early.
- It's an amazing opportunity.

12:35.750 --> 12:40.319
Amazing. I have a class in
here in 15 minutes, you know.

12:40.321 --> 12:43.355
Oh, well, you're gonna
want to hear this, Ben.

12:47.694 --> 12:48.592
Tell me.

12:48.594 --> 12:53.630
He killed two Rwandan park rangers
and injured three others...

12:53.632 --> 12:55.498
with a wooden club.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.833
He was studying the animals there, right?
Not anymore.

12:57.835 --> 13:03.505
The party of foresters and rangers
said he walked among them...

13:03.507 --> 13:05.306
<i>part of the animal group.</i>

13:05.308 --> 13:10.511
It's just possible, Ben, that he was
living with the mountain gorillas...

13:10.513 --> 13:14.648
for nearly two years.

13:15.417 --> 13:17.850
With them.

13:18.219 --> 13:21.753
"Noted anthropologist and
primatologist Ethan Powell...

13:21.755 --> 13:25.757
was reported missing
in October 1994."

13:26.426 --> 13:29.493
Lost for nearly two years,

13:29.495 --> 13:31.061
then found.

13:31.063 --> 13:35.131
But when they tried to contact
Ethan, he turned on them.

13:35.133 --> 13:35.998
Like an animal, they said.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.770
They put him in an African prison for a year.
He hasn't spoken a word since his arrest.

13:41.772 --> 13:45.039
So, what do we have here?

13:45.608 --> 13:48.075
He lives with the animals,

13:48.077 --> 13:51.078
takes on their behavior.

13:51.814 --> 13:54.080
Becomes one.

13:55.683 --> 13:59.317
How does that happen? <i> Exactly.</i>

13:59.319 --> 14:01.519
How?

14:02.488 --> 14:06.223
They want a 30-day evaluation, followed
immediately by a hearing with a judge.

14:06.225 --> 14:10.126
I'll give him a day to rest,
then I'll see him on Thursday.

14:10.128 --> 14:14.096
Uh, Ben, there's something
I want to ask you for.

14:14.098 --> 14:16.631
What is it? Ethan Powell.

14:16.633 --> 14:19.133
The evaluation... I want it.

14:19.568 --> 14:22.468
You don't have nearly enough
experience for a case like this.

14:22.470 --> 14:27.372
You know that, don't you?
Why should I give it to you?

14:28.341 --> 14:31.542
Important issues here, Ben. Yes.

14:31.544 --> 14:33.210
One of them is your career,
right?

14:33.212 --> 14:38.181
I mean, a case like this is all about career,
and you've been thinking about that.

14:38.183 --> 14:40.650
It'd be a leap for you.

14:40.652 --> 14:43.519
What if I can get him to speak?

14:44.455 --> 14:46.121
Get Powell to speak?

14:46.123 --> 14:50.158
Ah. You mustn't confuse
a mute murderer...

14:50.160 --> 14:53.728
with little Annie Belden
and her pope fantasy...

14:53.730 --> 14:57.665
or Rondelli the flasher
or any of those.

14:57.667 --> 15:00.501
What if I can?

15:03.539 --> 15:07.874
Well, then you write a best-seller
about it. Am I right?

15:10.178 --> 15:12.645
I'm ready for this, Ben.

15:13.147 --> 15:15.180
Do you have a title yet?

15:15.182 --> 15:17.649
For the best-seller?

15:19.519 --> 15:21.986
Maybe.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.822
<i>What is it? Tell me.</i>

15:24.824 --> 15:25.889
Is that a yes?

15:57.922 --> 16:02.224
So, how come he doesn't talk?

16:02.226 --> 16:05.660
Well, they say...

16:06.129 --> 16:09.130
<i>that he used to live</i>
<i>with monkeys.</i>

16:11.767 --> 16:13.500
Where?

16:13.502 --> 16:16.970
"Where?" Michigan.

16:16.972 --> 16:19.439
Oh.

16:27.147 --> 16:31.015
Peter. Peter, why?

16:31.017 --> 16:33.117
<i>Look what you did.</i>

16:33.119 --> 16:34.885
Ex-Excuse me.

16:34.887 --> 16:38.455
<i>Our ball. Excuse me.</i>

16:39.391 --> 16:41.858
Excuse me!

16:41.860 --> 16:45.394
<i>Can we have our ball back?</i>

16:45.396 --> 16:48.296
Peter.

17:22.198 --> 17:25.999
I hear you almost took out
a correctional at the airport.

17:26.401 --> 17:29.368
I hope you try that in here...

17:31.438 --> 17:33.671
once.

17:39.211 --> 17:42.545
Pete, what'd you get, buddy?

17:42.880 --> 17:46.882
<i>Hey, Pete, what card</i>
<i>did you get, man?</i>

17:46.884 --> 17:50.085
Pete!

18:16.279 --> 18:18.479
<i>Let me see the card!</i>
<i>Let me see.</i>

18:18.481 --> 18:20.848
<i>Let me see. Show me your card.
That ain't my ace.</i>

18:20.850 --> 18:24.718
I want my ace of diamonds
I want my ace of diamonds!

18:24.720 --> 18:28.388
<i>Give me the card!</i>
<i>Show me the card!</i>

18:29.424 --> 18:32.258
<i>You got my ace? You got my ace?</i>

18:32.260 --> 18:34.126
You got my ace. You got my ace!

18:34.128 --> 18:39.498
<i>You got my ace! You got
my ace, don't you?</i>

18:39.500 --> 18:43.835
You got my ace!
That ain't my ace!

18:43.837 --> 18:47.138
I want my ace!

18:54.780 --> 18:57.747
Give me my card.
You got the ace of diamonds.

18:57.749 --> 19:03.285
Show me the card. Let me see the card!
The card!

19:12.228 --> 19:15.262
<i>Ace of diamonds! Show it to me!</i>

19:15.264 --> 19:17.330
<i>Show me the card!</i>

19:17.332 --> 19:21.834
<i>Give me the card.</i>
<i>Card! Ace of diamonds!</i>

19:21.836 --> 19:24.236
You got my card?
I want my card!

19:24.238 --> 19:28.139
Give me my card!

19:45.757 --> 19:48.190
I got it again!

19:48.192 --> 19:51.226
Ace of diamonds!

19:53.863 --> 19:56.897
Mr. Dacks, it looks like
it's Bluto again.

19:56.899 --> 19:59.432
<i>I got it again!</i>

19:59.434 --> 20:02.268
<i>The ace of diamonds!</i>

20:02.270 --> 20:07.072
Bluto, you are one lucky
son of a gun.

20:51.917 --> 20:57.520
Just as long as you're confident
they're sticking to the schedule.

20:57.522 --> 21:00.222
It's the same thing
every day, sir.

21:00.224 --> 21:05.060
<i>Warden, I'm Dr. Theo Caulder.</i>

21:05.062 --> 21:06.327
I'm Jack Keefer.

21:06.329 --> 21:11.699
This is Dr. John Murray, in charge
of our psychotics. How do you do?

21:11.701 --> 21:15.502
What do you think
of our anthill, Dr. Caulder?

21:15.504 --> 21:17.670
- <i> Is Dr. Powell down there?</i>
- No.

21:17.672 --> 21:20.439
The psychotics are not
in the general population.

21:20.441 --> 21:21.973
<i>Uh, could we get you</i>
<i>one of these?</i>

21:21.975 --> 21:25.242
It's got vanilla bean in it this morning.
Uh, no, thank you.

21:25.244 --> 21:28.245
I'd actually like
to get started.

21:28.480 --> 21:33.950
I can give you Powell now in an unused
visitation room and again on Friday.

21:33.952 --> 21:39.655
You and Dr. Murray can work out a schedule
for your time with the other inmates.

21:39.657 --> 21:40.989
The "other inmates"?

21:40.991 --> 21:45.426
I was told you'd be on temporary
staff at our facility, Doctor.

21:45.428 --> 21:46.827
That's the deal.

21:46.829 --> 21:52.232
Well, I was kind of hoping to spend
most of every day with Powell.

21:53.235 --> 21:58.137
This is Harmony Bay, Dr. Caulder.
It was out of date 30 years ago.

21:58.139 --> 22:03.442
It's crumbling under our feet. Two, three
years, they're gonna tear the old girl down.

22:03.444 --> 22:06.445
Meanwhile, we have the toughest
correctional job in the state.

22:06.447 --> 22:10.549
I'm gonna have to ask you to try to
fit in with our scheme of things...

22:10.551 --> 22:14.319
and treat Powell
like every other inmate.

22:14.321 --> 22:16.988
I hope that's okay with you.

22:25.765 --> 22:28.198
Watch the cup for me.

22:36.575 --> 22:39.876
Well, here we are.

23:16.447 --> 23:19.281
Haldol, 20 milligrams,
four times a day?

23:19.283 --> 23:24.319
- How am I supposed to talk to him?
- He doesn't talk, remember?

23:30.626 --> 23:35.095
Dr. Theo Caulder. First interview
with Dr. Ethan Powell.

23:35.097 --> 23:36.863
<i>Dr. Powell,</i>
<i>I'm Dr. Theo Caulder.</i>

23:36.865 --> 23:41.133
I know you've chosen not to speak,
and I respect your decision.

23:41.135 --> 23:44.870
I want to offer to you the
possibility, for your consideration,

23:44.872 --> 23:47.472
that you suspend your silence
just for these sessions,

23:47.474 --> 23:50.908
that you see these sessions
as outside your normal life...

23:50.910 --> 23:54.845
so that you may speak to me,
discussing whatever you like,

23:54.847 --> 23:58.181
<i>then remain silent</i>
<i>for the rest of the day.</i>

23:58.183 --> 24:01.317
These sessions can be
your opportunity...

24:01.319 --> 24:02.951
before you go back
to your silence...

24:02.953 --> 24:08.790
to say to me, to the world,
to your family, whatever you...

24:11.227 --> 24:13.493
whatever you might want to say.

24:13.495 --> 24:17.196
<i>First, Doctor,</i>
<i>I'd like you to say your name.</i>

24:19.066 --> 24:21.733
- Or you can write it on...
- Hey!

24:22.769 --> 24:24.635
Don't do that.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.236
Couple of rules, Doctor:

24:26.238 --> 24:29.205
Don't reach across;
Don't touch the violent ones;

24:29.207 --> 24:34.043
Don't give 'em anything; And don't
take anything from 'em, all right?

24:34.045 --> 24:38.414
- Okay.
- That's what <i> we're</i> here for.

24:38.416 --> 24:40.616
Henry.

24:46.056 --> 24:49.223
Or you can write it
on that piece of paper.

24:50.326 --> 24:52.726
What is your name?

24:53.261 --> 24:55.794
Doctor, what is your name?

24:59.800 --> 25:02.167
<i>Write it on that paper.</i>

25:02.169 --> 25:04.602
What is your name?

25:28.191 --> 25:30.991
Can I see
what you've written there?

25:32.594 --> 25:36.128
Hey.

25:37.231 --> 25:39.464
- Go!
- Hey!

25:39.466 --> 25:42.700
Get him up! Stand up!
That's enough.

25:42.702 --> 25:47.638
Okay, okay. That's it, that's it.
That's it, I'm done.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.940
I'm done.

25:58.549 --> 26:00.949
Hello, Dr. Caulder.

26:00.951 --> 26:02.650
How, uh... How did it go?

26:02.652 --> 26:05.519
The patient is overmedicated
and brutalized.

26:05.521 --> 26:08.755
Well, hell, Dr. Caulder,
do you know where you are?

26:08.757 --> 26:13.693
We have room for 700, but we
have over 1,000 of the worst...

26:13.695 --> 26:15.928
And that's not counting
the psychotics, is it, Alan?

26:15.930 --> 26:19.464
Forty-two highfliers, Warden.
Do you know who Dr. Powell was?

26:19.466 --> 26:22.266
Is that a look, son? I want
the medication reduced.

26:22.268 --> 26:27.971
<i>Hey! Come over here!</i> Go ahead and do
your best job you can here, Doctor,

26:27.973 --> 26:33.509
as long as it doesn't conflict
with our rules.

27:23.994 --> 27:26.594
Hey, ape man!

27:27.897 --> 27:30.430
Just give him
what he wants, Ethan.

27:30.432 --> 27:32.765
Hand it over!

27:34.368 --> 27:36.601
Trade you for the ace.

27:36.603 --> 27:38.202
Now!

27:38.204 --> 27:38.704
Now!

27:53.550 --> 27:56.584
<i>Come on, get him!</i>

27:56.586 --> 27:58.485
Guys! No! Wait!

27:58.487 --> 28:00.987
Please, please! Just check
his pocket, please!

28:00.989 --> 28:04.256
<i>Please, he's got the ace! He's got it!
And it's his ace!</i>

28:04.258 --> 28:06.358
It is his... ace!

28:09.996 --> 28:14.131
- It's his ace.
- It's his ace.

28:25.376 --> 28:28.343
Enjoy, ape man!

28:42.592 --> 28:44.959
Right over there.

28:52.134 --> 28:55.869
Half an hour.

29:51.754 --> 29:55.456
Hi. Miss Powell,
I'm Dr. Caulder.

29:57.493 --> 30:00.760
<i>I need to find a way</i>
<i>to break through.</i>

30:00.762 --> 30:02.361
- We tried that.
- Well, I can do it.

30:02.363 --> 30:07.999
We tried in Africa. We visited the prison there.
He never even looked at us.

30:08.468 --> 30:12.236
- Well, he looked at me.
- He did?

30:12.238 --> 30:15.505
He tried to give me a pencil.

30:16.875 --> 30:20.309
Look, I saw him at the airport.

30:20.311 --> 30:23.445
It destroyed my mother. She's
away, staying with her sister.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.447
She needed a change
of scene and a lot of Xanax.

30:25.449 --> 30:29.384
I'm only here to sell the house,
because she won't live here anymore.

30:29.386 --> 30:31.619
Your father may be very ill.
Really?

30:31.621 --> 30:34.989
I thought maybe
he was just in a bad mood.

30:35.291 --> 30:39.793
Do you want your father back?
Back the way he was?

30:40.529 --> 30:43.196
The way he was. Um... Hmm?

30:43.198 --> 30:47.667
Do you mean... distant,
obsessed with his work,

30:47.669 --> 30:51.203
<i>not concerned with his family?</i>

30:57.444 --> 30:59.444
Yes, I want him back.

30:59.446 --> 31:00.778
<i>What do you want?</i>

31:00.780 --> 31:05.149
He can give me a look at man in his
primitive state... ungoverned man.

31:05.151 --> 31:08.418
Look, I don't want you showing him
off like some madman with a club.

31:08.420 --> 31:12.822
I'm writing an evaluation,
not some grocery-store headline.

31:13.825 --> 31:17.393
This evaluation will be good
for your career, won't it?

31:17.395 --> 31:20.229
Does it matter?

31:28.405 --> 31:32.740
If I can open him up,
I might be able to help him.

31:32.742 --> 31:34.708
Help him?

31:34.710 --> 31:36.409
You mean,
get him out of prison?

31:36.411 --> 31:39.745
Your father might belong
in prison. I don't know.

31:40.013 --> 31:43.447
But I don't think anyone
belongs at Harmony Bay.

31:43.449 --> 31:46.516
And I do need your help.

31:52.223 --> 31:56.525
This is where he worked
when he was home.

32:09.039 --> 32:12.173
<i>You were there. Yes. Once.</i>

32:12.175 --> 32:16.477
<i>I was just traveling through.</i>
<i>I showed up and surprised him.</i>

32:16.479 --> 32:18.412
<i>Stayed a couple days.</i>

32:18.414 --> 32:23.884
<i>He was very happy to see me</i>
<i>and very happy to see me go.</i>

32:27.589 --> 32:32.158
<i>Who took these?</i>
<i>Are there any more?</i>

32:32.426 --> 32:38.062
I set the timer for this
one, and I took the rest.

32:40.466 --> 32:43.166
<i>This is my work.</i>

32:45.336 --> 32:50.906
Okay. Why don't you, um, just
take what you need and then go.

33:27.944 --> 33:34.381
<i>Dr. Theo Caulder. Second interview
with patient, Dr. Ethan Powell.</i>

33:34.383 --> 33:37.484
How are we today, Dr. Powell?

33:37.486 --> 33:41.955
Dr. Powell is unresponsive.

33:46.227 --> 33:49.661
I'm gonna ask you to identify
certain objects, Doctor.

33:49.663 --> 33:53.631
You can speak
or write down your answer.

34:06.479 --> 34:10.147
What is this a picture of,
Doctor?

34:10.449 --> 34:14.717
- The patient makes no sign that he can understand.
- And this?

34:20.558 --> 34:22.991
<i>And this?</i>

34:27.797 --> 34:29.463
<i>And this?</i>

34:29.465 --> 34:32.264
<i>What is this a picture of,</i>
<i>Doctor?</i>

34:33.167 --> 34:35.600
Can you write it down?

34:40.572 --> 34:43.574
<i>And this?</i>

34:47.246 --> 34:51.614
<i>And this?</i>
<i>What is this a picture of?</i>

34:58.557 --> 35:00.790
And this?

35:03.461 --> 35:05.861
- Hey, leave him alone! Leave him alone!
- Goddamn it!

35:05.863 --> 35:09.197
- I told you not to do that! Keep your distance!
- Leave the patient!

35:09.199 --> 35:13.801
- Do not cross this line!
- Back away from my patient.

35:15.070 --> 35:18.571
Back away from the patient!

35:20.541 --> 35:22.641
Okay, Doctor.

35:22.643 --> 35:25.043
It's your ass.

35:28.181 --> 35:33.083
Your silence says, "Yes,
I'm still an animal...

35:33.085 --> 35:38.288
"a wild, dangerous animal.

35:38.290 --> 35:41.090
"You can beat me,
you can cage me.

35:41.092 --> 35:44.426
"I'm not human anymore.

35:44.428 --> 35:46.027
"I have nothing to say...

35:46.029 --> 35:51.365
"not to some shrink across
the table, not to any guard,

35:51.367 --> 35:53.767
not even to her."

35:57.105 --> 36:00.272
But she still wants her father.

36:02.442 --> 36:04.542
She wants you back.

36:04.544 --> 36:07.678
What do you say to that?

36:09.048 --> 36:11.848
What do you say to her?

36:14.319 --> 36:17.320
Good-bye.

36:30.168 --> 36:33.802
Have I made your fucking day?

36:34.571 --> 36:37.972
Do you wanna die?
Is that what you want?

36:42.845 --> 36:47.080
- Uh, the patient is not responding.
- Quiet.

36:47.082 --> 36:48.848
I'll take that as a no.

36:48.850 --> 36:52.651
Do you want
to stay here forever?

36:53.420 --> 36:56.788
<i>Or do you wanna go home?</i>

37:00.760 --> 37:02.760
<i>Africa? Here?</i>

37:02.762 --> 37:05.329
You wanna go back here?

37:06.465 --> 37:11.568
If I cut your medication, will
you take me there with you?

37:11.570 --> 37:14.037
- You can't cut the medication.
- Shut up!

37:14.039 --> 37:16.105
I will not be yelled at by
some yuppie res... <i> Dr. Murray!</i>

37:16.107 --> 37:20.109
I don't know you very well, but I have
the feeling that you are a tired,

37:20.111 --> 37:22.711
incompetent bag of shit
who has found a place to hide.

37:22.713 --> 37:25.947
You overmedicate these men, and you
turn your back when they're tortured.

37:25.949 --> 37:29.317
If I'm wrong,
I deeply apologize.

37:29.552 --> 37:33.787
If I cut your medication,
help you remember,

37:33.789 --> 37:36.356
will you take me with you?

37:39.227 --> 37:42.161
Can you follow me?

37:43.264 --> 37:47.232
Yes. Yes, I'll follow.

38:10.023 --> 38:13.858
<i>But she still wants her father.</i>

38:13.860 --> 38:16.660
She wants you back.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.896
What do you say to that?

38:21.132 --> 38:24.199
What do you say to her?

38:25.735 --> 38:28.869
Good-bye.

38:42.184 --> 38:44.184
How'd you do it?

38:44.186 --> 38:47.120
He chose to speak.

38:47.956 --> 38:50.089
He chose you.

38:50.091 --> 38:53.092
Yes.

38:54.195 --> 38:56.061
Why you?

38:56.063 --> 38:58.430
I don't know.

38:58.865 --> 39:01.065
<i>But I can get inside</i>
<i>of him now.</i>

39:01.067 --> 39:05.736
<i>I just need you to... help
me to understand who he was.</i>

39:14.545 --> 39:19.314
And if I do, you have to get me
in to see him, to talk to him.

39:20.483 --> 39:22.749
I'll try.

39:24.486 --> 39:27.353
I will. I'll try.

39:30.524 --> 39:33.591
<i>¶¶</i>

39:39.498 --> 39:41.664
<i>Theo.</i>

39:41.666 --> 39:43.465
Ben. Dr. Josephson.

39:43.467 --> 39:47.535
I was told you made a
breakthrough on the Powell case.

39:47.537 --> 39:48.636
Good work. Thank you.

39:48.638 --> 39:53.307
You know, I read your paper on voluntary
mutism, so I had a slight advantage.

39:53.309 --> 39:56.610
Oh, you're the one who read it.

39:59.781 --> 40:01.881
I'll leave you two.
Breakfast on Wednesday.

40:01.883 --> 40:05.784
I'll call your office. His
paper on voluntary mutism...

40:05.786 --> 40:10.121
didn't have anything to do with
the Powell case, and you know it.

40:10.123 --> 40:13.257
How's it going? Have you
ever been to Harmony Bay?

40:13.259 --> 40:15.192
Mmm. Thanks, Mike.

40:15.194 --> 40:18.161
Tell me your war stories.

40:18.163 --> 40:21.597
You never mentioned I'd have
to be on staff there, Ben.

40:21.599 --> 40:24.633
Well, it was
a negotiation, Theo.

40:24.635 --> 40:26.701
They're understaffed.

40:26.703 --> 40:30.004
Thanks. You want out?

40:30.006 --> 40:31.839
No.

40:31.841 --> 40:33.640
I want Powell.

40:33.642 --> 40:36.309
He's leading me
into the jungle.

40:38.212 --> 40:39.678
He's leading <i> you?</i>

40:39.680 --> 40:44.382
Well, I... You're doing
the evaluation, not him.

40:44.384 --> 40:48.018
And there's more at stake here,
Theo, than your book.

40:48.020 --> 40:49.219
I know. I know, Ben.

40:49.221 --> 40:52.622
Now that the patient is speaking,
it's a different ball game,

40:52.624 --> 40:53.689
different expectations.

40:53.691 --> 40:57.159
The competency hearing will be scheduled
as soon as you present your evaluation.

40:57.161 --> 41:03.298
And that report... your report... and your
testimony will be very carefully judged,

41:03.300 --> 41:06.434
so you have to be prepared.

41:06.436 --> 41:08.636
Keep focused.

41:08.638 --> 41:11.672
Lead him to the questions
you want answered.

41:11.674 --> 41:14.508
I will.

41:14.510 --> 41:15.876
I will!

41:15.878 --> 41:21.715
You just don't understand. It's not
the usual therapeutic environment.

41:23.852 --> 41:27.019
Then don't be
the usual therapist.

41:41.201 --> 41:43.568
Go on. Sit down.

41:45.438 --> 41:48.572
Welcome, Doctor.

41:49.474 --> 41:53.075
Will you excuse us, gentlemen?

42:10.827 --> 42:15.095
Dr. Theo Caulder. Third interview
with Dr. Ethan Powell.

42:15.964 --> 42:20.232
Doctor, do you know why
you've been sent here?

42:24.771 --> 42:27.271
What a brave lad you are.

42:27.506 --> 42:30.640
You can call me "Doctor."
"Dr. Caulder."

42:30.642 --> 42:32.708
Yes,<i> bwana.</i>

42:32.710 --> 42:35.811
I will call you
<i>"Tabibu Juha</i> Caulder."

42:35.813 --> 42:38.713
<i>Tabibu Juha.</i> Swahili.

42:38.715 --> 42:41.449
It'll help me remember. That's
what you want, isn't it?

42:41.451 --> 42:44.518
It's my memories. That's
what you want, isn't it?

42:44.520 --> 42:49.489
You attacked several officers
at the Miami airport.

42:49.491 --> 42:51.290
Guilty.

42:51.292 --> 42:56.762
In Rwanda you were convicted of murder.
Are you a murderer?

42:59.500 --> 43:01.867
Ah, yes.

43:01.869 --> 43:04.169
Tell me about that.

43:04.171 --> 43:07.939
<i>Tell me about Africa.</i>

43:09.542 --> 43:12.576
I know you always went alone.

43:12.878 --> 43:17.347
Twenty-one trips...
over 12 years,

43:17.349 --> 43:22.452
and you never took
a companion or a colleague.

43:22.687 --> 43:24.353
Never with your wife,
who wanted to go.

43:24.355 --> 43:28.123
Never with your daughter, who
you invited, then uninvited.

43:28.125 --> 43:32.460
What are you up to? Therapy?

43:35.832 --> 43:40.334
My job. I wanna know
why this is difficult.

43:40.669 --> 43:44.270
Are you afraid
to go back there?

43:48.476 --> 43:50.776
Are you afraid to follow?

43:50.778 --> 43:53.512
Try me.

44:32.019 --> 44:34.219
Describe what you see.

44:36.523 --> 44:40.458
Tell me. Tell me what you see.

44:43.463 --> 44:46.430
The Virunga volcanoes.

44:47.232 --> 44:50.733
The great forests of Visoke.

44:50.735 --> 44:55.771
So beautiful.

44:56.273 --> 44:59.807
<i>And there's some flatland,</i>

45:01.277 --> 45:05.245
and there's a river
beyond the trees.

45:06.448 --> 45:10.917
And in the middle
is my base camp.

45:10.919 --> 45:13.486
It's a good camp.

45:13.488 --> 45:19.492
My tent... is there.
It's right there.

45:23.698 --> 45:26.532
- So you're off.
- Already now.

45:26.534 --> 45:29.167
<i>Okay. I'll check the list.
</i> Again?

45:29.169 --> 45:31.135
Willie, your father's leaving.

45:31.137 --> 45:34.638
- Willie!
- <i> He will come. He will come.</i>

45:34.640 --> 45:38.608
<i>Willie, come on! Willie?</i>

45:38.610 --> 45:41.711
There you are.
What are you doing?

45:41.713 --> 45:44.647
<i>Come on, your father's leaving.
</i> See? For your wrist.

45:44.649 --> 45:47.182
I've been looking for this.
Okay, off you go now.

45:47.184 --> 45:51.686
The sooner you go, the sooner
I'll get my supplies. Go on.

46:31.593 --> 46:37.163
<i>Ethan? Ethan?</i>
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

47:38.625 --> 47:42.760
<i>There he was...</i>
<i>the silverback, their leader.</i>

47:42.762 --> 47:49.767
<i>I'd been observing this group for
months but had never been this close.</i>

47:50.136 --> 47:54.338
<i>So close, so magnificent.</i>

47:59.945 --> 48:04.714
<i>It was terrifying...</i>
<i>and wonderful.</i>

48:34.342 --> 48:36.975
<i>I thought my presence</i>
<i>was making them nervous,</i>

48:36.977 --> 48:40.678
<i>but it wasn't that,</i>
<i>it was the machine...</i>

48:40.680 --> 48:44.815
<i>the camera...</i>
<i>that didn't belong.</i>

48:44.817 --> 48:51.221
<i>So I stopped using it, and it
was then I began to see them...</i>

48:51.223 --> 48:54.190
<i>for the first time.</i>

49:04.568 --> 49:08.636
<i>I wondered if they missed me</i>
<i>when I left for the night...</i>

49:08.638 --> 49:14.074
<i>this man who watched them</i>
<i>outside their circle.</i>

49:15.610 --> 49:18.077
<i>Did they think of me?</i>

49:18.079 --> 49:20.879
<i>I thought of them,</i>

49:20.881 --> 49:22.881
<i>and I missed them.</i>

49:22.883 --> 49:27.919
<i>I liked them.</i>
<i>I even needed them.</i>

49:34.827 --> 49:39.596
<i>Each day they seemed</i>
<i>to allow me to step closer.</i>

49:39.598 --> 49:43.299
<i>I was excited</i>
<i>by my slow journey toward them.</i>

49:44.435 --> 49:45.534
<i>I felt privileged.</i>

49:45.536 --> 49:50.205
<i>I felt, in a way, as if I was
coming back to something...</i>

49:50.207 --> 49:56.744
<i>I had lost long ago</i>
<i>and was only now remembering.</i>

50:08.591 --> 50:12.292
<i>Suddenly, just like that,</i>
<i>it happened.</i>

50:12.294 --> 50:15.728
<i>I was no longer</i>
<i>outside the group.</i>

50:15.730 --> 50:20.966
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>I was among them.</i>

50:25.806 --> 50:27.338
<i>I never missed a day.</i>

50:27.340 --> 50:31.075
<i>I walked miles from my camp</i>
<i>to find them.</i>

50:31.077 --> 50:34.478
<i>And stayed with them</i>
<i>longer and longer...</i>

50:34.480 --> 50:41.518
<i>before I'd pull myself away</i>
<i>to go back to camp every night.</i>

53:20.511 --> 53:26.214
<i>In there,</i>
<i>deep in those forests,</i>

53:26.516 --> 53:29.783
<i>away from everything you know,</i>

53:29.785 --> 53:32.318
<i>everything</i>
<i>you've ever been taught...</i>

53:32.320 --> 53:36.322
<i>by school or book</i>
<i>or song or rhyme,</i>

53:36.324 --> 53:40.993
<i>you find peace,</i> Juha, <i> kinship,</i>

53:41.829 --> 53:45.964
<i>harmony, even safety.</i>

53:46.466 --> 53:49.467
<i>You'll find more danger in one
day in any city in the world...</i>

53:49.469 --> 53:53.270
than you will ever find
in those forests.

53:53.272 --> 53:55.739
Do you understand that?

53:57.642 --> 54:00.643
Ah, mixed up.
You're all mixed up.

54:03.114 --> 54:05.714
I wanna go back to my cell now.

54:05.716 --> 54:07.982
Wait.

54:08.818 --> 54:10.918
Okay, okay. Wait. Wait.

54:10.920 --> 54:15.656
Please.
What's the playing card for?

54:17.593 --> 54:19.192
Control.

54:19.194 --> 54:22.094
Control of you? By whom?

54:22.096 --> 54:28.266
- By you... takers.
- "Takers"? Explain that.

54:29.502 --> 54:32.369
I wanna go to my cell now.

54:32.371 --> 54:35.672
The session's not over.

54:35.674 --> 54:37.874
Until you say so?

54:37.876 --> 54:39.809
Right.

54:39.811 --> 54:41.877
The taker.

54:56.626 --> 54:58.826
You're free to go.

54:58.828 --> 55:01.028
Am I?

55:01.864 --> 55:06.533
And you? Are you free?

55:36.764 --> 55:39.998
Only in my head. You! You!

55:43.303 --> 55:45.202
I know about
the ace of diamonds.

55:45.204 --> 55:48.672
Every prisoner is supposed
to spend a half an hour outside.

55:48.674 --> 55:49.973
Every prisoner, every day.

55:49.975 --> 55:53.743
We can only afford the time and
personnel to do <i> a</i> rotation...

55:53.745 --> 55:57.780
one patient a day... so we make
it random, use the cards.

55:57.782 --> 56:00.482
It doesn't work. It keeps
them focused on something.

56:00.484 --> 56:03.184
The strong take it
from the weak every time.

56:03.186 --> 56:07.087
And the rest of them focus their
anger on the ones who take it...

56:07.089 --> 56:09.089
and not on the guards
or medical staff.

56:09.091 --> 56:14.094
It <i> does</i> work. For us.
It works for us.

56:17.299 --> 56:20.066
Here's charts on ten of them.

56:20.068 --> 56:21.534
You can start there.

56:21.536 --> 56:25.971
Do you ever see them alone?
There isn't time for that.

56:25.973 --> 56:28.573
There's the consulting area.

56:31.844 --> 56:33.777
We do what we can.

56:33.779 --> 56:36.780
You do what you're told.

56:38.083 --> 56:39.715
Go ahead. Hit me again.

56:39.717 --> 56:42.918
I'm easy. And you'll
feel so much better.

56:42.920 --> 56:45.153
What was it you called me?

56:45.155 --> 56:48.089
Tired, incompetent bag of shit?

56:48.091 --> 56:50.925
Christ, you think I never
fought a battle in here?

56:50.927 --> 56:55.663
You want to know
what it was like before me?

56:55.665 --> 56:58.766
We do what we fucking can.

57:35.471 --> 57:37.671
Hi. Hi.

57:37.673 --> 57:39.839
Peter Holden? Uh-huh.

57:39.841 --> 57:41.507
You gonna be our shrink now?

57:41.509 --> 57:43.308
For a while. <i> You got
a resume with you?</i>

57:43.310 --> 57:49.113
- Any credentials or anything?
- Let's go over here, please, Peter.

58:03.529 --> 58:04.494
I'm Dr. Caulder.

58:04.496 --> 58:10.867
You've been charged with one count of murder,
and found incompetent to stand trial.

58:10.869 --> 58:13.903
She had a demon in her
for a while,

58:13.905 --> 58:15.738
my neighbor Mrs. Karsh.

58:15.740 --> 58:19.308
Mm-hmm. <i> It would come and go.</i>

58:19.310 --> 58:22.511
Nobody saw it... except me.

58:22.513 --> 58:26.114
What did it look like,
the demon?

58:26.116 --> 58:27.348
Um...

58:27.350 --> 58:32.820
Did you ever see <i> Alien</i>
with Sigourney Weaver?

58:32.822 --> 58:36.557
It looked like a giant insect?

58:36.559 --> 58:38.292
No.

58:38.294 --> 58:40.994
It looked like
Sigourney Weaver.

58:45.633 --> 58:48.200
Hey, Dacks!
Why don't you stop this?

58:48.202 --> 58:53.205
Why? They have to work out their own problems.
He won't kill him.

59:05.352 --> 59:06.751
Oh, this is Phillip!

59:06.753 --> 59:09.620
<i>All right.</i>
<i>All right, guys. Back up.</i>

59:09.622 --> 59:12.189
Back up! Oh, my God! You
got to help him, Doc!

59:12.191 --> 59:15.392
Get him off! Somebody help me, please!
Get him off me!

59:15.394 --> 59:19.396
Get him off me. Help him!
Please help him, Doctor.

59:19.398 --> 59:21.564
<i>Please. Please.</i>

59:23.234 --> 59:24.666
Come on. Stop the bleeding.

59:24.668 --> 59:29.303
Hey, calm down! <i> You got
to stop the bleeding, Doc!</i>

59:33.675 --> 59:36.008
<i>Come on, Doc!</i>

59:36.010 --> 59:40.545
<i>Come on, Doc!</i>
<i>Stop the bleeding, Doc!</i>

01:00:02.569 --> 01:00:06.203
Dr. Theo Caulder, continuing
interview with Dr. Ethan Powell.

01:00:06.205 --> 01:00:10.607
I've further reduced your Haldol.
Have you felt the effects of that?

01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:12.041
Yeah. Thank you.

01:00:12.043 --> 01:00:17.079
<i>In our last session, we discovered why
you left your normal routine of study...</i>

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:20.982
and began to travel with the gorillas,
staying with them even at night.

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:26.287
Our next subject to cover is
the reason for... Hey, look.

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:30.423
It fell off the chair.
Mm. Great.

01:00:30.425 --> 01:00:33.826
Our next subject to cover
is the reason for...

01:00:33.828 --> 01:00:36.296
Are these for me? Yes.

01:00:36.298 --> 01:00:38.831
Oh. The reason for the
attack on the rangers...

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:42.734
No pencils? These are safer.

01:00:43.503 --> 01:00:45.903
Oh, yeah.

01:00:47.907 --> 01:00:49.840
Okay.

01:00:51.677 --> 01:00:54.978
No pencils.

01:00:55.513 --> 01:00:59.581
Are you coming back to the
gym today,<i> Tabibu Juha</i> ? Yes.

01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:02.116
Am I worth it?
All the mess and blood?

01:01:02.118 --> 01:01:05.686
I'm here to do an evaluation.
That's what I do.

01:01:05.688 --> 01:01:07.387
Am I so interesting?

01:01:07.389 --> 01:01:10.590
You lived as an animal
for nearly two years.

01:01:10.592 --> 01:01:13.726
I'd say you were
interesting enough, sure.

01:01:13.728 --> 01:01:17.062
I lived as a man
living with animals.

01:01:17.064 --> 01:01:20.198
I lived as humans lived
10,000 years ago.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.869
Humans knew how to live
in the world then, before...

01:01:24.871 --> 01:01:27.371
Before civilization?

01:01:27.973 --> 01:01:30.039
No, before you,<i> Juha,</i>

01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:32.341
and all your kind.

01:01:32.343 --> 01:01:35.377
Takers.

01:01:37.147 --> 01:01:40.481
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:43.052 --> 01:01:46.453
Yeah, I was one of you.
I believed in control.

01:01:46.455 --> 01:01:51.191
Some control is necessary.
Is it?

01:01:59.967 --> 01:02:04.703
The gorillas, they let you stay with them, even at night.
You were becoming one of them.

01:02:04.705 --> 01:02:08.840
Are you listening?
Are you listening to me?

01:02:08.842 --> 01:02:11.442
Yes.

01:02:11.444 --> 01:02:13.877
Not one of them.

01:02:13.879 --> 01:02:16.579
Not a gorilla.

01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:19.081
Don't you see?

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:21.183
They accepted a man.

01:02:21.185 --> 01:02:24.186
They reached across.

01:02:24.188 --> 01:02:27.255
They took me in as family.

01:02:27.557 --> 01:02:30.824
They welcomed a human being
among them.

01:02:30.826 --> 01:02:33.293
That's the miracle.

01:02:33.995 --> 01:02:37.496
What about the family
you left behind?

01:02:37.498 --> 01:02:40.866
<i>What about Lyn?</i>

01:02:44.438 --> 01:02:46.571
We leave her outside of this.

01:02:46.573 --> 01:02:49.206
Why? And my wife.
Leave them out.

01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:53.243
You think I don't know. I know what
I was, what I lost, what I killed.

01:02:53.245 --> 01:02:57.313
She's not dead. She wants to see you.
She saw me at the airport.

01:02:57.315 --> 01:03:00.783
She saw what I am now.

01:03:02.853 --> 01:03:05.887
You let me be dead to her.

01:03:05.889 --> 01:03:08.756
You change the subject,<i> Juha,</i>

01:03:08.758 --> 01:03:10.791
or walk away from this.

01:03:10.793 --> 01:03:13.627
<i>Which do you want?</i>

01:03:23.271 --> 01:03:26.505
For now, I want the forest.
Take me there.

01:03:26.507 --> 01:03:30.542
In the forest
for all that time.

01:03:30.544 --> 01:03:34.679
Did you ever miss
the contact with any humans?

01:03:44.757 --> 01:03:46.723
No. They were there.

01:03:46.725 --> 01:03:51.728
I may not have seen them, but I
always knew they were there.

01:05:41.204 --> 01:05:44.238
<i>If you were learning</i>
<i>their ease...</i>

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.740
Their peace.

01:05:47.676 --> 01:05:53.279
Their peace. Then why does
this all end in murder?

01:05:56.083 --> 01:05:58.149
There were many murders.

01:05:58.151 --> 01:06:01.452
Many? Yeah.

01:06:05.558 --> 01:06:09.493
There's a zoo not far from
here where I studied...

01:06:09.495 --> 01:06:11.695
and many years ago...

01:06:11.697 --> 01:06:13.797
and, uh...

01:06:13.799 --> 01:06:16.633
they needed a male gorilla,

01:06:16.635 --> 01:06:18.368
a wild capture.

01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:20.670
And I did that.
I helped capture him.

01:06:20.672 --> 01:06:24.306
I didn't even know what murder
was when I was you,<i> Juha.</i>

01:06:24.308 --> 01:06:25.940
You know what murder
I'm talking about.

01:06:25.942 --> 01:06:28.442
If you don't talk to me about
this, I can't help you.

01:06:28.444 --> 01:06:33.146
I don't want you to help me.
What <i> do</i> you want?

01:06:34.082 --> 01:06:35.948
I want you to listen.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.350
And then what? Share it.

01:06:38.352 --> 01:06:43.621
With? Whoever you share with,
the people you're close to.

01:06:43.623 --> 01:06:45.990
Are there any?

01:06:45.992 --> 01:06:48.625
Why don't you tell others?

01:06:51.596 --> 01:06:54.697
'Cause I'm not for this world,

01:06:54.699 --> 01:06:57.332
not anymore.

01:06:58.301 --> 01:06:59.667
What world, then?

01:06:59.669 --> 01:07:04.672
In your memories, locked away in
your mind for the rest of your life?

01:07:04.674 --> 01:07:06.907
<i>Is that all you want?</i>
No, I want to finish this.

01:07:06.909 --> 01:07:09.276
- Finish what?
- Telling you what I know.

01:07:09.278 --> 01:07:14.748
What makes you think what you know is any
different than what other people know?

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:17.450
I had different teachers.

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:24.221
Okay, okay.

01:07:24.223 --> 01:07:29.192
So I'm supposed to...
pass on your work.

01:07:29.194 --> 01:07:30.626
Yeah, for all it's worth.

01:07:30.628 --> 01:07:34.196
What made you pick me?
A look in your eye.

01:07:34.198 --> 01:07:38.667
You seemed to have half a brain.
Thank you. What look?

01:07:40.437 --> 01:07:42.170
That look...

01:07:42.172 --> 01:07:46.073
curious, searching,
unsatisfied,

01:07:46.075 --> 01:07:48.608
slightly pissed off.

01:07:50.612 --> 01:07:53.379
Why didn't you pick
your daughter?

01:07:53.381 --> 01:07:55.381
Leave it alone.

01:07:55.383 --> 01:07:59.118
Why do you refuse to talk about her?
Leave it.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.689
She wants to see you.
I say we talk about it.

01:08:04.992 --> 01:08:07.459
Hmm.

01:08:10.096 --> 01:08:11.562
I was wrong about you,<i> Juha.</i>

01:08:11.564 --> 01:08:16.099
- Explain that.
- Tell them to open this door. You're not the one,<i> Juha.</i>

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.301
- I'm not the one?
- No.

01:08:18.303 --> 01:08:19.602
<i>I'm not the one</i>
<i>who cut your medication?</i>

01:08:19.604 --> 01:08:24.773
I'm not the one to say if you're competent for
a hearing, a chance of getting outta here?

01:08:24.774 --> 01:08:28.143
- I'm the one, Ethan.
- Are you?

01:08:31.046 --> 01:08:32.679
I'm the one.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.848
The one in control, huh? Yes.

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:42.054
Who's in control?

01:08:51.697 --> 01:08:55.799
So who is in control, huh?
Are you?

01:08:55.801 --> 01:08:57.100
Am I?

01:08:57.102 --> 01:09:00.069
The guards outside?
The warden in his office?

01:09:00.071 --> 01:09:03.404
Yeah? Who's in control?

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:06.941
Testing, testing, testing.
One, two, three, four.

01:09:06.943 --> 01:09:09.276
Dr. Ethan Powell,
interviewing Dr. Theo Caulder.

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:13.813
Now, this will be a very simple test.
Pass or fail, life or death.

01:09:13.814 --> 01:09:18.951
Ready,<i> Juha</i> ? Now, you write on this
paper what I have taken from you.

01:09:18.953 --> 01:09:24.189
What have you lost?
Write it! Write it!

01:09:25.926 --> 01:09:29.694
Wrong. You never had control.
You only thought you had it.

01:09:29.696 --> 01:09:32.196
An illusion,<i> Tabibu Juha</i>!

01:09:32.198 --> 01:09:35.532
And what do you control
for sure, huh?

01:09:35.533 --> 01:09:40.435
The volume on your stereo, the air
conditioning in your car? What else?

01:09:40.438 --> 01:09:43.205
What else? All right.

01:09:43.207 --> 01:09:46.374
Another chance. You were nervous.
Too much pressure. Try again.

01:09:46.376 --> 01:09:49.643
What have you lost?
What did I take?

01:09:49.645 --> 01:09:52.578
Write it. Write it!

01:09:59.187 --> 01:10:02.254
You're a fool,<i> Juha.</i>

01:10:02.256 --> 01:10:04.789
Ha!

01:10:05.792 --> 01:10:07.458
Did you think you were free?

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:10.861
Where were you going at 2:00 today?
Into the gym, right?

01:10:10.863 --> 01:10:12.729
In the morning,
your wake-up call.

01:10:12.731 --> 01:10:16.365
In the middle of the night when you wake
up sweating, with your heart pounding.

01:10:16.367 --> 01:10:22.170
What is it that has you all tied
up,<i> Juha,</i> tied up in little knots?

01:10:22.172 --> 01:10:24.872
Is it ambition?

01:10:24.874 --> 01:10:26.373
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:29.442
You're no mystery to me, boy.

01:10:29.444 --> 01:10:32.077
I used to be you.

01:10:35.916 --> 01:10:39.684
Okay. One last chance.

01:10:39.686 --> 01:10:41.552
You think I won't do it?

01:10:41.554 --> 01:10:44.721
What's one psychiatrist less
to the world?

01:10:44.723 --> 01:10:49.025
I'm already deep in the pit.
So what can they do to me?

01:10:49.027 --> 01:10:52.428
Last try. Get it right.

01:10:53.063 --> 01:10:55.430
What have you lost?

01:10:55.432 --> 01:10:58.666
What did I take from you?

01:10:58.668 --> 01:11:01.035
Write it.

01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:16.015
<i>Yeah. Congratulations.</i>

01:11:21.022 --> 01:11:23.956
You're a student, after all.

01:11:23.958 --> 01:11:27.759
And you've lost nothing
but your illusions...

01:11:27.761 --> 01:11:31.395
<i>and a little bit of skin.</i>

01:11:57.655 --> 01:11:59.354
Hi. Hi.

01:11:59.356 --> 01:12:01.289
What happened to your face?

01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:04.759
Gets a little rough
in there sometimes.

01:12:04.761 --> 01:12:08.095
Well, what happened to it?

01:12:08.097 --> 01:12:10.163
Duct tape.

01:12:10.165 --> 01:12:12.498
Oh.

01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:18.136
My father did this to you? Yes.

01:12:18.138 --> 01:12:21.339
What did he do?
He was teaching me.

01:12:21.341 --> 01:12:24.875
Looks like
a pretty tough class.

01:12:27.579 --> 01:12:29.645
Are you gonna quit now?

01:12:29.647 --> 01:12:31.480
No. I never quit.

01:12:31.482 --> 01:12:36.852
Even when I'm doing something
really stupid, I never quit.

01:12:38.455 --> 01:12:40.588
Are you like that? No.

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:45.793
I once played solitaire for 48
games straight until I won.

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:47.961
Solitaire, huh? That figures.

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:51.497
I don't have time
for a lot of people.

01:12:51.499 --> 01:12:54.266
Do you have time for one?

01:12:54.268 --> 01:12:57.837
Don't get nervous.
I didn't mean me.

01:13:00.007 --> 01:13:01.873
Uh, want a drink?

01:13:01.875 --> 01:13:04.642
Yes. <i> Let's go out.</i>

01:13:05.711 --> 01:13:08.511
Two cars. No date.

01:13:17.755 --> 01:13:23.558
You know, it's all right if you need
to hold on to somebody for a minute.

01:13:25.995 --> 01:13:29.363
It's all right if you don't.

01:13:44.645 --> 01:13:47.012
Doc, you won't believe this.
What is it?

01:13:47.014 --> 01:13:51.249
Just see for yourself, Doc. You
got to see it for yourself.

01:13:51.251 --> 01:13:53.684
Doc, what you doing?

01:13:53.686 --> 01:13:58.221
<i>Hey, Doc, what</i>
<i>do you make of it?</i>

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.133
What is this?

01:14:11.135 --> 01:14:13.101
Not finished.

01:14:13.103 --> 01:14:16.871
Ethan... Take your time, Doc.

01:14:18.107 --> 01:14:22.075
What are you making here? The
true history of mankind.

01:14:22.077 --> 01:14:26.079
It's a true history.
No fiction, no lie.

01:14:26.081 --> 01:14:28.915
Africa, two million years ago.

01:14:28.917 --> 01:14:31.951
Humans. Then they moved.

01:14:32.887 --> 01:14:34.419
Migrated.

01:14:34.421 --> 01:14:38.589
Ten thousand years ago,
civilization. You.

01:14:38.591 --> 01:14:40.657
This is me?

01:14:40.659 --> 01:14:42.625
Yeah, and me too. Us.

01:14:42.627 --> 01:14:45.995
Takers. Who are
the blue people?

01:14:45.997 --> 01:14:50.032
They're tribal societies...
hunters, gatherers, planters.

01:14:50.034 --> 01:14:53.201
They never killed more
animals than they could use.

01:14:53.203 --> 01:14:57.038
They never plowed more land
than they needed.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.409
They fought, but they never waged war.
Never exterminated.

01:15:01.411 --> 01:15:06.814
They had a place in the world. And
in the world, they were part of it.

01:15:06.816 --> 01:15:09.683
And they shared it.

01:15:09.685 --> 01:15:12.118
We changed all that.

01:15:16.791 --> 01:15:23.028
Now, what, are we supposed to change it back?
What are we supposed to do?

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:24.729
Move.

01:15:24.731 --> 01:15:27.765
Move where? Out of my way.

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:32.268
What, are we supposed to unbuild the
cities, wander off into the jungle?

01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:35.070
A stupid, specious argument.
You figure it out.

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:38.873
<i>I'm busy.</i> You're a pain
in the neck, Ethan.

01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:42.509
I know. Now get out.

01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:51.383
Dominion.

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.320
What?

01:15:56.322 --> 01:16:01.191
We have only one thing
to give up... our dominion.

01:16:01.193 --> 01:16:03.059
We don't own the world.

01:16:03.061 --> 01:16:07.196
We're not kings here, not gods.

01:16:07.198 --> 01:16:10.232
Can we give that up?

01:16:10.234 --> 01:16:12.500
Too precious, all that control?

01:16:12.502 --> 01:16:16.136
Too tempting, being a god?

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:29.215
Where's my card?
I still don't have my card.

01:16:29.217 --> 01:16:31.917
Where's my card?

01:16:35.222 --> 01:16:38.790
My card! Where... Show me
my... That's not mine.

01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:43.561
<i>I want my card. Do you have my card?
</i> I got a box here!

01:16:43.563 --> 01:16:47.898
I have a box here
with everybody's name in it!

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:51.134
It is mine! Give me that!
Show me the card!

01:16:51.136 --> 01:16:52.768
<i>I want to see</i>
<i>my ace of diamonds.</i>

01:16:52.770 --> 01:16:55.537
Can you hit that? <i> Ace of diamonds!
Show it to me!</i>

01:16:55.539 --> 01:16:59.407
Bang that hard.
Bang, bang, bang!

01:16:59.409 --> 01:17:02.610
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

01:17:02.612 --> 01:17:07.247
I have a box here
with everyone's name in it!

01:17:07.249 --> 01:17:10.416
All of you are in this box.

01:17:11.852 --> 01:17:13.318
I have picked one name.

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:17.088
This is the name of the person
that will go outside today.

01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:20.424
<i>We're not using the ace</i>
<i>anymore. Understand?</i>

01:17:20.426 --> 01:17:24.194
<i>We're not using</i>
<i>the ace anymore.</i>

01:17:24.462 --> 01:17:27.596
Each day I will pick
one name from this box,

01:17:27.598 --> 01:17:30.365
<i>and that person</i>
<i>will go outside.</i>

01:17:30.367 --> 01:17:33.701
Then I will set his name aside, and
the next day I'll pick a new name.

01:17:33.703 --> 01:17:37.471
<i>Everybody will have</i>
<i>their equal turn.</i>

01:17:40.642 --> 01:17:43.409
And today it's Lester Rodman.

01:17:47.681 --> 01:17:51.115
Where are you? Lester Rodman.

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:54.117
<i>Lester Rodman?</i>

01:17:54.652 --> 01:17:57.953
Lester Rodman, where are you?

01:17:59.222 --> 01:18:02.723
- Lester Rodman, today you get to go outside.
- <i> All right!</i>

01:18:02.725 --> 01:18:06.326
Let's find that ace.
Come on. Who's got that ace?

01:18:06.328 --> 01:18:10.463
Who the hell's got it?

01:18:10.465 --> 01:18:13.032
<i>'Cause I want it!</i> We're not
using the ace anymore.

01:18:13.034 --> 01:18:16.335
<i>Today Lester Rodman goes out... Come on.
Let's see the cards.</i>

01:18:16.337 --> 01:18:18.804
<i>Let's see your card. Come on.</i>

01:18:18.806 --> 01:18:21.973
<i>You got the ace, Pete?</i>

01:18:22.976 --> 01:18:27.211
How about you, Ethan?
You got the ace?

01:18:27.613 --> 01:18:30.313
<i>Come on, now.</i>
<i>Let me see that card.</i>

01:18:30.315 --> 01:18:33.516
<i>Don't be shy.</i>
<i>Let's see your card.</i>

01:18:33.518 --> 01:18:36.652
- Dacks.
- Let me see it.

01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:46.194
What was that? Was that a look?

01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:50.464
<i>Dacks, damn it, don't.</i>

01:18:51.366 --> 01:18:53.366
The cards are finished.

01:18:53.368 --> 01:18:56.369
The cards are garbage.
Do you understand?

01:18:56.371 --> 01:19:00.373
You throw 'em away. We're
not using the ace anymore.

01:19:00.375 --> 01:19:03.909
Everybody goes outside.
Everybody goes.

01:19:03.911 --> 01:19:08.013
<i>Everybody goes!</i>
<i>Everybody goes outside!</i>

01:19:08.015 --> 01:19:11.883
- Everybody goes!
- Everybody goes outside!

01:19:13.586 --> 01:19:17.888
Everybody goes outside!
Everybody goes outside!

01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:22.158
- Everybody goes.
- Outside, everybody!

01:19:27.331 --> 01:19:30.098
Pick up those pieces!

01:19:30.934 --> 01:19:34.068
<i>Everybody goes outside!</i>

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:38.204
Dacks, damn it, you hit him again,
I'll have you up on charges.

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:43.742
Pick 'em up.

01:20:23.884 --> 01:20:26.184
Son of a bitch.

01:20:35.328 --> 01:20:38.062
Lester Rodman goes today.

01:20:40.733 --> 01:20:43.700
Maybe you go tomorrow.

01:20:43.702 --> 01:20:47.203
No cards. No ace.

01:20:47.205 --> 01:20:49.672
No fighting.

01:21:04.121 --> 01:21:06.688
Let's go, Lester.

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:24.238
¶¶

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:34.748
Haven't you learned anything yet?
I guess not.

01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:37.817
That coffee's been burning
for nine hours.

01:21:37.819 --> 01:21:40.719
<i>After ten, use the instant.</i>

01:21:40.721 --> 01:21:43.555
It's in the top cupboard.

01:21:48.093 --> 01:21:51.694
Well, how's
the medical staff today?

01:21:51.696 --> 01:21:53.829
Fine, sir. Fine.

01:21:53.831 --> 01:21:55.897
Splendid.

01:21:57.333 --> 01:21:59.333
You fine, too, Dr. Caulder?

01:21:59.335 --> 01:22:04.871
Doing okay. Can I get you
some coffee, Warden?

01:22:04.873 --> 01:22:07.039
<i>I'm not here for coffee.</i>

01:22:07.041 --> 01:22:09.408
Okay. I'm here to talk about...

01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:12.778
that little episode
in the gymnasium today.

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.879
We worked out
a different system.

01:22:13.881 --> 01:22:18.516
You think you can walk into my institution,
start changing rules and causing riots?

01:22:18.518 --> 01:22:21.819
There was no riot. The
prisoners refused orders,

01:22:21.821 --> 01:22:24.555
and my guards had to use
force because of you.

01:22:24.557 --> 01:22:28.158
The force wasn't necessary. All
the violence came from Mr. Dacks.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.026
<i>He was trying</i>
<i>to provoke Powell.</i>

01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:34.363
Powell is dangerous, and he was dealt
with as a dangerous psychotic.

01:22:34.365 --> 01:22:38.700
No, no, no.
He offered no danger, none.

01:22:38.702 --> 01:22:43.337
Dr. Murray, did Powell
behave in a threatening way...

01:22:43.339 --> 01:22:45.939
at any time?

01:22:51.212 --> 01:22:53.579
No.

01:22:57.051 --> 01:23:01.186
I'll have a talk with Mr. Dacks.
Splendid.

01:23:01.454 --> 01:23:05.689
Meanwhile, your little game
compromised my authority...

01:23:05.691 --> 01:23:07.590
and the authority of my guards.

01:23:07.592 --> 01:23:12.027
Do you know what that means
at a maximum security prison?

01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:13.728
You put everyone at risk.

01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:18.332
The safety of every man here rests with
me, Caulder, and I can't trust you.

01:23:18.334 --> 01:23:21.535
And I want you out.

01:23:21.537 --> 01:23:24.371
You have ten days.
And I'm being generous.

01:23:24.373 --> 01:23:30.710
I have 15 days left in my evaluation.
I'll leave when I'm finished.

01:23:32.447 --> 01:23:35.047
Now you have seven days.

01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:07.412
- How does he have the...
- Hang on a second.

01:24:07.414 --> 01:24:11.416
How does he have the right
to cut my evaluation time?

01:24:11.418 --> 01:24:13.551
He doesn't,

01:24:13.553 --> 01:24:16.587
but he has the power
to kick you out...

01:24:16.589 --> 01:24:19.623
whenever he wants to
and bring in somebody else.

01:24:19.625 --> 01:24:22.525
So write your conclusion.
Wrap it up.

01:24:22.527 --> 01:24:27.062
If I have more time, I think
I can get him out of there.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.700
What are you talking about?

01:24:33.436 --> 01:24:36.370
The hearing. I think when
the judge hears the man...

01:24:36.372 --> 01:24:41.007
who he is, what he has to say... I
think he'll walk out of there.

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:43.843
You're not
his defense attorney.

01:24:44.178 --> 01:24:47.679
You're not his pal.
What are you after?

01:24:47.681 --> 01:24:50.948
Big time ending for the book?
Not about a book.

01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:54.952
It's not about my
career... It should be.

01:24:57.489 --> 01:25:01.357
Theo, you walked
into this case...

01:25:01.359 --> 01:25:03.125
under my guarantee,

01:25:03.127 --> 01:25:07.329
with an opportunity
to further yourself.

01:25:07.331 --> 01:25:10.865
Now, are you willing to put
all that at risk possibly,

01:25:10.867 --> 01:25:13.334
<i>damage your career possibly,</i>

01:25:13.336 --> 01:25:16.603
<i>embarrass me?</i>

01:25:16.605 --> 01:25:19.272
Sorry, yes.

01:25:21.776 --> 01:25:27.112
Then stop complaining about the
time you have left and use it.

01:25:27.114 --> 01:25:30.648
<i>Push the man. Shake him.</i>

01:25:30.650 --> 01:25:33.684
- Where does the violence come from?
- I'm not sure...

01:25:33.686 --> 01:25:36.453
- The gorillas?
- I'm not sure of the connection.

01:25:36.455 --> 01:25:37.921
Well, find it.

01:25:37.923 --> 01:25:40.523
The only way he is ever going
to get out of that place...

01:25:40.525 --> 01:25:45.895
<i>is for you to make that judge feel
that Powell is sane and safe.</i>

01:25:45.897 --> 01:25:48.264
You show where
the violence came from,

01:25:48.266 --> 01:25:52.334
<i>and you show</i>
<i>that the violence has gone.</i>

01:25:52.336 --> 01:25:55.403
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

01:25:55.405 --> 01:25:59.640
<i>Good. You're on your own.</i>

01:26:04.947 --> 01:26:07.280
Thanks.

01:26:09.284 --> 01:26:11.917
See you later.
I'll call you later.

01:26:11.919 --> 01:26:14.219
Okay.

01:26:17.224 --> 01:26:21.025
Hello. This is a surprise.

01:26:21.027 --> 01:26:21.992
Sorry. I, uh...

01:26:21.994 --> 01:26:27.831
The message said you'd be home after
7:00, so... So you came by to check?

01:26:27.833 --> 01:26:31.134
Were you hall monitor
in school?

01:26:31.136 --> 01:26:33.436
Yes, I was.

01:26:35.706 --> 01:26:41.209
Funny, I never got a sense
of you in your parents' house.

01:26:41.211 --> 01:26:45.379
This is definitely more... Messy?

01:26:45.381 --> 01:26:47.748
More you.

01:26:48.617 --> 01:26:50.883
So...

01:26:50.885 --> 01:26:53.719
what did he do to you
this time?

01:26:53.721 --> 01:26:56.922
I don't see
any cuts or bruises.

01:26:56.924 --> 01:26:59.691
This time it wasn't him.

01:27:01.594 --> 01:27:06.463
I only have seven days left
with your father. That's it.

01:27:12.971 --> 01:27:16.605
Are they going to take
the case away from you?

01:27:16.607 --> 01:27:18.907
Case.

01:27:18.909 --> 01:27:22.043
It's not a...

01:27:22.045 --> 01:27:25.146
not a case anymore.

01:27:25.148 --> 01:27:28.015
It's not a book either.

01:27:29.118 --> 01:27:33.920
He may break my neck tomorrow, but I
think I'm becoming a friend of his...

01:27:33.922 --> 01:27:36.188
<i>and his student.</i>

01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:38.523
His <i> Tabibu Juha.</i>

01:27:42.562 --> 01:27:44.595
He calls you that?

01:27:44.597 --> 01:27:47.764
I think <i> "Tabibu"</i>
means "doctor."

01:27:47.766 --> 01:27:50.733
Yes, it does.

01:27:54.238 --> 01:27:56.905
What does <i> "Juha"</i> mean?

01:27:57.574 --> 01:28:00.007
<i>"Juha"</i> means...

01:28:01.343 --> 01:28:03.509
"idiot."

01:28:10.017 --> 01:28:12.617
Yeah.

01:28:14.387 --> 01:28:18.822
Well, I must be, because I
can't figure this one out.

01:28:19.991 --> 01:28:24.727
He knows I can't bring
a gorilla into his cell and...

01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:28.063
What?

01:28:29.966 --> 01:28:32.433
What?

01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:44.578
Where are we going? Fresh
air, a ride in the country.

01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:49.950
You'll like it. It's wilderness all the way.
They're waiting for us.

01:28:49.952 --> 01:28:53.086
Who? What are you
planning,<i> Juha</i> ?

01:28:53.088 --> 01:28:55.188
I'm not your idiot anymore.

01:28:55.190 --> 01:28:58.891
You finally looked it up. No.

01:28:58.893 --> 01:29:01.693
Your daughter told me.

01:29:17.943 --> 01:29:19.842
Watch your step.

01:29:35.258 --> 01:29:39.260
The gorillas are
in the cage room now.

01:30:04.186 --> 01:30:06.653
Whoa!

01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:12.524
Jesus Christ.

01:30:22.168 --> 01:30:25.135
The old silverback's
been with us the longest.

01:30:25.137 --> 01:30:28.471
You remember him, Dr. Powell.
He's the one you...

01:30:28.473 --> 01:30:32.308
I'm sorry. We need
to be alone in here.

01:30:37.214 --> 01:30:39.681
The restraints?

01:30:40.150 --> 01:30:44.318
I'll put them back on him
before we leave.

01:30:49.791 --> 01:30:54.460
You understand if he comes out
of that door without them on...

01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:16.614
I thought you'd feel
safer here.

01:31:16.716 --> 01:31:22.119
<i>I thought if you were around
them, you'd talk to me.</i>

01:31:22.621 --> 01:31:27.256
Tell me about the violence,
about the killing.

01:31:27.258 --> 01:31:30.659
These are shadows of gorillas.

01:31:30.661 --> 01:31:33.228
Born in cages.

01:31:34.331 --> 01:31:38.433
Only the old male...
he was free once.

01:31:39.769 --> 01:31:42.503
<i>Still alive.</i>

01:31:42.505 --> 01:31:44.705
Goliath.

01:31:45.574 --> 01:31:49.475
I named him that.
I brought him here.

01:31:49.477 --> 01:31:52.711
<i>This cage has broken him.</i>

01:31:52.713 --> 01:31:56.347
<i>Broken his heart,</i>
<i>broken his mind.</i>

01:31:58.384 --> 01:32:01.818
Made him insane.

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:04.120
I did that.

01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:08.523
I understand that, Ethan. I do.

01:32:08.525 --> 01:32:11.959
But I need to know
about the killing.

01:32:15.597 --> 01:32:19.465
There's a female
just like that one.

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:23.535
Was there ever
any violence among them?

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:26.638
Was there any violence
towards you?

01:32:29.275 --> 01:32:33.076
There were warnings.

01:32:33.078 --> 01:32:35.778
Warnings.

01:33:00.736 --> 01:33:05.271
<i>She was a good mother</i>
<i>and a good teacher.</i>

01:33:05.273 --> 01:33:10.542
The baby was always
protected, always instructed.

01:33:10.544 --> 01:33:14.112
Always groomed, always...

01:33:14.114 --> 01:33:16.114
touched,

01:33:16.116 --> 01:33:17.682
safe.

01:33:17.684 --> 01:33:20.685
She used to watch over him,

01:33:20.687 --> 01:33:24.755
<i>the way the old silverback</i>
<i>used to watch over...</i>

01:33:24.757 --> 01:33:27.424
all of us,

01:33:27.426 --> 01:33:30.126
even me.

01:33:31.762 --> 01:33:34.429
It's an amazing...

01:33:34.431 --> 01:33:37.965
feeling, Theo,
to be watched over.

01:33:50.813 --> 01:33:54.047
<i>I discovered</i>
<i>in that look of his...</i>

01:33:54.049 --> 01:33:57.083
more than watchfulness...

01:33:57.085 --> 01:33:59.685
<i>tolerance,</i>

01:33:59.687 --> 01:34:01.453
<i>acceptance.</i>

01:34:01.455 --> 01:34:04.722
<i>In fact, he was...</i>

01:34:12.598 --> 01:34:14.831
Ethan?

01:34:16.835 --> 01:34:18.668
<i>Ethan, what is it?</i>

01:34:18.670 --> 01:34:21.370
What is it?

01:34:21.372 --> 01:34:24.539
What's wrong?

01:36:31.957 --> 01:36:34.857
Shh. Shh.

01:36:34.859 --> 01:36:38.126
Shh.

01:39:26.484 --> 01:39:29.318
<i>It was me.</i>

01:39:30.254 --> 01:39:33.221
<i>They'd found my things.</i>

01:39:36.825 --> 01:39:39.559
Been tracking me.

01:39:41.863 --> 01:39:44.630
So I brought them.

01:39:45.399 --> 01:39:49.367
I brought the... takers...

01:39:49.369 --> 01:39:51.802
and death.

01:39:53.972 --> 01:39:57.006
Still he looks at me
without blame.

01:39:57.008 --> 01:40:00.109
<i>Because you're not to blame,</i>

01:40:00.111 --> 01:40:02.778
not for any of it.

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:05.947
You were just defending
your family.

01:40:27.170 --> 01:40:31.572
- Ethan, close it.
- <i> He won't come out.</i>

01:40:31.574 --> 01:40:36.009
You see? Even if he can.

01:40:38.713 --> 01:40:43.649
Not far from here is a fence, and on the
other side of that fence is freedom,

01:40:43.651 --> 01:40:46.318
<i>and he can smell it.</i>

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:49.821
<i>He'll never try to get there,</i>

01:40:49.823 --> 01:40:52.723
'cause he's given up.

01:40:54.126 --> 01:40:59.496
By now he thinks freedom
is something he dreamed.

01:41:00.499 --> 01:41:03.233
And you?

01:41:03.235 --> 01:41:05.802
Have you given up?

01:41:06.304 --> 01:41:09.872
<i>Because we have a chance to get you
out of here now, a good chance.</i>

01:41:09.874 --> 01:41:13.809
This is all I need...
what you've told me.

01:41:18.348 --> 01:41:21.082
It's not just something
you dreamed.

01:41:21.084 --> 01:41:23.584
It's real.

01:41:53.881 --> 01:41:58.450
I'd like you to wear this to the hearing today.
Where'd you get that?

01:41:58.452 --> 01:42:00.485
Lyn brought it.

01:42:00.487 --> 01:42:03.721
She's still here.

01:42:13.466 --> 01:42:17.835
- Ethan, you can do this.
- Leave it alone.

01:42:17.837 --> 01:42:20.337
What are you so afraid of?

01:42:20.339 --> 01:42:24.040
I don't want to hurt her.

01:42:24.042 --> 01:42:26.642
You've already done that.

01:42:26.644 --> 01:42:32.014
Remember the first thing you said to me?
The first word? Remember?

01:42:32.016 --> 01:42:36.485
You told me to tell
your daughter good-bye.

01:42:36.487 --> 01:42:38.954
Tell her yourself.

01:43:05.782 --> 01:43:08.649
I don't know what to say.

01:43:12.187 --> 01:43:13.886
How are you?

01:43:13.888 --> 01:43:17.155
That sounds stupid, I guess.

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.426
I miss you.

01:43:24.997 --> 01:43:27.464
Your father is a fool.

01:43:28.467 --> 01:43:31.034
If you were just born, I would
pick you up and hold you...

01:43:31.036 --> 01:43:36.506
and take you everywhere with me
and never walk away from you.

01:43:38.376 --> 01:43:40.676
You're such a treasure, Lyn.

01:43:40.678 --> 01:43:45.647
<i>You're so much better than your father.
You don't hate.</i>

01:43:45.649 --> 01:43:48.883
You don't even hate me.

01:43:49.685 --> 01:43:54.421
<i>You know that</i>
<i>when I went away from you,</i>

01:43:54.423 --> 01:43:58.792
I always took you
with me, inside.

01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:04.163
I would love to believe that.

01:44:04.698 --> 01:44:08.166
Well, this is all
I have left for you.

01:44:08.168 --> 01:44:11.536
It's the only possession
I kept.

01:45:00.787 --> 01:45:02.653
You'll wait in your cell
till I come and get you.

01:45:02.655 --> 01:45:07.624
The van'll be here in 25 minutes. The
hearing starts at 4:00. Understand?

01:45:07.626 --> 01:45:10.827
<i>You'll change out of</i>
<i>that pretty blue suit...</i>

01:45:10.829 --> 01:45:12.862
and turn it over for storage.

01:45:12.864 --> 01:45:15.397
- Any questions?
- Sorry, Ethan.

01:45:17.401 --> 01:45:21.770
<i>Ethan, there was nothing</i>
<i>we could do.</i>

01:45:31.948 --> 01:45:34.181
Inside.

01:45:38.554 --> 01:45:41.121
I said, "Inside"!

01:45:42.424 --> 01:45:44.424
Stop hitting him!
Stop hitting him!

01:45:44.426 --> 01:45:48.194
- You think that's funny, Nicko?
- Just stop hitting him!

01:45:48.196 --> 01:45:51.430
Ow!

01:45:51.832 --> 01:45:53.665
- I got Dacks!
- Oh, you wanna play, Pete?

01:45:53.667 --> 01:45:56.334
No, no! Sorry, Mr. Dacks. You
think that's funny, Pete?

01:45:56.336 --> 01:45:58.936
Huh? You think that's funny?
It was an accident.

01:45:58.938 --> 01:46:02.339
You want to play? Come here.
No, you can't come in here.

01:46:02.341 --> 01:46:04.741
You can't come in, Mr. Dacks.
You can't come in.

01:46:04.743 --> 01:46:08.478
No, Mr. Dacks. No, don't
be bad, Mr. Dacks.

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:11.080
You wanna play "Can't Come In"?
We'll play.

01:46:11.082 --> 01:46:13.982
- No! Mr. Dacks!
- Let's play, Pete.

01:46:13.984 --> 01:46:16.050
- No!
- You wanna play, Pete?

01:46:16.052 --> 01:46:17.851
- No!
- Well, let's play!

01:46:17.853 --> 01:46:21.287
Ow! No! Ow!

01:46:21.289 --> 01:46:25.357
You want to play?
Think this is for fun?

01:46:25.359 --> 01:46:27.325
Huh?

01:46:44.676 --> 01:46:46.008
Aah!

01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:49.911
Damn it! Lock this place down!

01:46:49.913 --> 01:46:52.280
<i>I want this place locked down!</i>

01:46:52.282 --> 01:46:54.815
<i>Anderson, secure the block</i>
<i>and cuff that son of a bitch!</i>

01:46:54.817 --> 01:46:57.184
<i>Get back in there! Settle down!</i>

01:46:57.186 --> 01:47:01.621
<i>Shut up! Shut up!</i>

01:47:07.161 --> 01:47:10.495
I heard. You want
to stay for supper?

01:47:10.497 --> 01:47:16.033
- I blew it. I lost him.
- He's silent again.

01:47:16.035 --> 01:47:19.369
It's over. Let it go.

01:47:19.371 --> 01:47:23.206
He was protecting
his family... again.

01:47:23.208 --> 01:47:26.309
I should have been with him
every minute.

01:47:26.311 --> 01:47:28.577
Let it go.

01:47:29.846 --> 01:47:33.180
And don't worry...
about anything.

01:47:33.182 --> 01:47:37.584
I'll speak to Josephson,
smooth things over.

01:47:37.586 --> 01:47:39.953
I'll help you cut your losses.

01:47:39.955 --> 01:47:43.456
And his losses?

01:47:44.292 --> 01:47:46.425
It's true, isn't it?

01:47:46.427 --> 01:47:48.360
He'll never get out of there.

01:47:48.362 --> 01:47:50.662
It was never your job
to get him out of there.

01:47:50.664 --> 01:47:53.598
Theo, there is nothing
to be done.

01:47:54.367 --> 01:47:56.333
<i>Know when to walk away.</i>

01:47:56.335 --> 01:47:58.802
You help the ones you can.

01:48:01.039 --> 01:48:06.108
I'm sorry. I've let you down,
and I barged in here...

01:48:06.110 --> 01:48:08.310
Theo.

01:48:10.414 --> 01:48:16.284
If you don't let this end,
you'll do yourself damage.

01:48:16.519 --> 01:48:20.754
You got involved... emotionally.
It happens.

01:48:20.756 --> 01:48:25.391
Now you have to get
your focus back.

01:48:25.393 --> 01:48:27.893
You're losing control.

01:48:29.429 --> 01:48:32.797
Wouldn't that be nice?

01:48:41.807 --> 01:48:43.573
Mealtime! Line 'em up!

01:48:43.575 --> 01:48:48.277
- You heard him. Let's go.
- -<i> Single file!</i>

01:48:56.286 --> 01:48:58.819
<i>I'm ready, I'm ready,</i>
<i>I'm ready.</i>

01:48:58.821 --> 01:49:00.821
Dr. Caulder,
what's wrong with him?

01:49:00.823 --> 01:49:04.057
<i>Nicko, back in line.</i>
Dr. Caulder...

01:49:04.059 --> 01:49:06.225
Any change?

01:49:06.227 --> 01:49:07.993
Not a word in three days.

01:49:07.995 --> 01:49:11.029
- Sorry.
- <i> Hey, ape man!</i>

01:49:11.031 --> 01:49:12.730
He said mealtime!

01:49:12.732 --> 01:49:15.933
Can you leave him there, Dacks?

01:49:25.077 --> 01:49:28.011
<i>Keep your hands at your side!</i>

01:49:58.608 --> 01:50:01.008
I'm sorry, Ethan.

01:50:02.111 --> 01:50:07.714
<i>I don't know if you can hear me,
but this is my last day, so...</i>

01:50:12.353 --> 01:50:14.920
I put Dacks up on charges.

01:50:14.922 --> 01:50:19.824
I still might be able to get you that
hearing, if you would just speak.

01:50:19.826 --> 01:50:23.394
If you would just come back.

01:50:26.399 --> 01:50:29.032
<i>Okay, Ethan.</i>

01:50:39.044 --> 01:50:40.777
You asked me a question once.

01:50:40.779 --> 01:50:42.979
<i>"What has you</i>
<i>all tied up in knots...</i>

01:50:42.981 --> 01:50:46.415
<i>when you wake up sweating</i>
<i>in the middle of the night?"</i>

01:50:46.417 --> 01:50:48.283
You still wanna know?

01:50:48.285 --> 01:50:52.453
I've been thinking about it. I've
been thinking about it a lot.

01:50:52.455 --> 01:50:56.089
It's not the work.
I love the work.

01:50:56.091 --> 01:50:59.192
I've always loved the work.

01:51:00.094 --> 01:51:02.461
It's the game.

01:51:03.831 --> 01:51:05.697
The game, Ethan.

01:51:05.699 --> 01:51:08.599
And I was so good at it.

01:51:08.601 --> 01:51:12.769
I made sure all
the right people liked me.

01:51:12.771 --> 01:51:15.738
At night, I'd do
the checklist in my mind.

01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:17.706
Am I cool with Ben Hillard?

01:51:17.708 --> 01:51:19.340
Am I cool with Dr. Josephson?

01:51:19.342 --> 01:51:21.809
Am I cool with all the people
who can help me?

01:51:21.811 --> 01:51:26.413
Am I cool with all the people
who can hurt me?

01:51:26.415 --> 01:51:30.183
Nobody thought I was weak
or a loser.

01:51:30.185 --> 01:51:33.653
There was nobody
I was offending,

01:51:35.156 --> 01:51:37.456
nobody I loved.

01:51:42.296 --> 01:51:45.130
<i>That</i> game, Ethan.

01:51:47.334 --> 01:51:50.134
But guess what?

01:51:51.036 --> 01:51:54.237
You taught me how
to live outside of the game.

01:52:01.479 --> 01:52:05.481
You taught me how to live.

01:52:08.752 --> 01:52:12.987
And you know what
scares me even more?

01:52:13.522 --> 01:52:15.588
That I'm going back in.

01:52:15.590 --> 01:52:18.357
"Forgive me, Ben.
Put me back in the game.

01:52:18.359 --> 01:52:21.460
"I'll make you like me again!
I'll do the work.

01:52:21.462 --> 01:52:26.431
I'll do all the work,
just put me back in the game!"

01:52:26.433 --> 01:52:29.033
And do you wanna know...

01:52:29.035 --> 01:52:32.036
You wanna know the psychology
behind this?

01:52:32.038 --> 01:52:36.840
Now, pay attention,
because I'm good at this.

01:52:36.842 --> 01:52:40.810
I'm trying not to say
good-bye to you.

01:52:45.650 --> 01:52:50.452
I'm trying not to say
I'll miss you.

01:52:56.760 --> 01:53:00.728
I'm trying to forget you.

01:53:05.967 --> 01:53:09.935
Ethan Powell, case closed.

01:53:11.271 --> 01:53:14.071
Case closed!

01:53:16.275 --> 01:53:18.541
Look at me.

01:54:02.349 --> 01:54:02.893
<i>Come on!</i>

01:54:14.226 --> 01:54:15.491
Oh, come on!

01:54:15.493 --> 01:54:19.394
- Take the bat off your shoulders, you bum!
- Calm down, Dacks!

01:54:19.396 --> 01:54:22.296
Hey, on a three-two count you gotta
protect the plate, you moron!

01:54:22.298 --> 01:54:25.866
- <i> Three and one, Dacks, not three and two.</i>
- First base.

01:54:25.868 --> 01:54:28.268
I would protect the plate.
We're on first base.

01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:30.703
<i>You gotta protect the plate.
</i> Right, the plate.

01:54:30.705 --> 01:54:34.707
<i>Protect the plate.</i>

01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:38.377
You see? You see? You see?

01:54:38.379 --> 01:54:40.412
<i>You take the lumber off</i>
<i>the shelf and you get a hit.</i>

01:54:40.414 --> 01:54:43.114
Peter! Hey, come on!

01:54:43.116 --> 01:54:46.450
- Pete, put it back in!
- Pete, please!

01:54:46.452 --> 01:54:50.520
- Put it back in, Pete!
- Hey, Pete!

01:54:51.456 --> 01:54:56.258
Give me the plug, Pete!
Give me the plug!

01:54:57.761 --> 01:55:02.196
- Give me the plug now!
- Stop! Stop it!

01:55:04.967 --> 01:55:08.134
Peter, give Guard Anderson
the plug. It's his birthday.

01:55:08.136 --> 01:55:12.938
<i>That's right, Pete.</i>
<i>It's my birthday.</i>

01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:16.874
You wanna give me a present?

01:55:16.876 --> 01:55:19.209
Come on, buddy. Let me have it.

01:55:19.211 --> 01:55:21.344
- That's it. Let go.
- <i> All right, all right.</i>

01:55:21.346 --> 01:55:25.548
<i>Plug it in. Come on.</i>
There you go.

01:55:26.217 --> 01:55:29.051
Are you gonna leave it
alone now?

01:55:31.655 --> 01:55:35.456
For you. Okay. For me.

01:56:07.554 --> 01:56:10.121
<i>Hey, Dr. Caulder's here!</i>
<i>Glad to see you, Doc.</i>

01:56:10.123 --> 01:56:13.724
<i>Hey! Caulder's back!</i>
<i>Welcome back, Doctor!</i>

01:56:13.726 --> 01:56:17.461
<i>Anything he does out there is
gonna come down on my head,</i>

01:56:17.463 --> 01:56:19.563
and I'm gonna come down
on yours!

01:56:19.565 --> 01:56:22.365
Heard you were long gone back to the city.
I thought you were all through here.

01:56:22.367 --> 01:56:27.703
I came back to talk to Powell. Well,
your highflier's gone out the window!

01:56:27.705 --> 01:56:29.204
Went through a hole
in the fence.

01:56:29.206 --> 01:56:32.440
We think he scaled the other one.
He must have had some help!

01:56:32.442 --> 01:56:38.179
<i>And he even wrote</i>
<i>a little note... to you!</i>

01:56:43.486 --> 01:56:48.288
Can you make heads or tails
of that? I sure can't.

01:56:54.095 --> 01:56:55.494
What?

01:56:55.496 --> 01:56:58.997
You're never gonna find him.
You know where he is?

01:57:03.803 --> 01:57:04.701
You're never gonna find him.

01:57:04.703 --> 01:57:08.805
If you got any idea where... If you're holding
out on me, you could be aiding an escapee.

01:57:08.807 --> 01:57:14.010
That is a felony, and I could
have you arrested for that!

01:57:18.383 --> 01:57:21.350
I'm beginning to like it here.

01:57:21.352 --> 01:57:22.951
<i>"Dear Theo.</i>

01:57:22.953 --> 01:57:25.853
<i>"I'm sorry I'm not there</i>
<i>to say good-bye.</i>

01:57:25.855 --> 01:57:28.188
<i>"You were right.</i>
<i>Freedom is not just a dream.</i>

01:57:28.190 --> 01:57:33.526
<i>"It's there on the other side of those
fences we build all by ourselves.</i>

01:57:33.528 --> 01:57:38.497
<i>"Thank you for giving me hope and
for giving me back my daughter.</i>

01:57:38.499 --> 01:57:43.869
<i>"And I thank you, Theo, for
sharing this journey with me.</i>

01:57:43.871 --> 01:57:46.504
<i>Your friend, Ethan."</i>
