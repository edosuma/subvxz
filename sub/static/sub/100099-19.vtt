WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.915
Previously
onSupergirl...

00:02.959 --> 00:04.700
The shrinking and collection
of worlds

00:04.743 --> 00:06.528
is a common practice
among our ancestors.

00:06.571 --> 00:08.878
William and I discovered
thatEve Tessmacher

00:08.921 --> 00:10.619
has been working
for Obsidian.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.448
If you're going to be
a vigilante,

00:13.491 --> 00:15.580
maybe you should get
better at hiding.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.104
What do you mean, like,
wear a mask?

00:17.147 --> 00:18.888
I don't know who
this Brainy is.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.629
But I know I don't trust him.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.500
Andrea knows nothing.

00:22.544 --> 00:25.025
Seems on this Earth,
post-Crisis, Leviathan
hasn't activated her yet.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.852
Gemma Cooper
is warming to me.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.593
And when she sees
my newest present,

00:28.637 --> 00:30.247
she'll roll out the red carpet.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.902
And if that means helping them
get a weapon or two, so be it.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.251
You know what
this weapon is,

00:34.295 --> 00:36.079
so you know what it needs.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.211
Get it for me.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.126
And this time, do not fail.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.956
Regarding your request
to meet my colleagues,

00:44.000 --> 00:45.610
I'll send you a car
tomorrow morning.

00:45.654 --> 00:46.916
See you tomorrow.

00:46.959 --> 00:49.266
I have made
a terrible mistake.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.442
Lex is working with Leviathan,

00:51.486 --> 00:54.837
and they are going
to use Obsidian to do
something terrible.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.621
I want to help
stop them.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.364
An elevator?

01:00.408 --> 01:02.714
Seems a little pedestrian
for a goddess of technology.

01:05.804 --> 01:07.284
Welcome to Leviathan.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.033
You know...

01:17.077 --> 01:18.469
I pride myself

01:18.513 --> 01:20.254
on seeing things.

01:20.297 --> 01:24.127
Connections where others
see only coincidence.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.521
Pathways where others
see only walls.

01:27.348 --> 01:28.305
I anticipate everything.

01:28.349 --> 01:29.611
But I must admit,

01:29.654 --> 01:32.222
I didn't not except you
to live in a casino.

01:40.491 --> 01:41.318
After you.

01:43.277 --> 01:44.887
One small step from that--

01:47.672 --> 01:49.239
Lex Luthor.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.762
The fabled man of tomorrow.

01:50.806 --> 01:53.113
At least you have the decency
to bow before the gods.

01:53.156 --> 01:55.115
I told you to disable
the shields.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.160
As long as he knows
where we live it stays on.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.770
At all times.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.598
-On whose orders?
-Whose do you think?

02:01.947 --> 02:03.645
-The ship's defense mechanism.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.603
A proto-focused
radiation shield.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.215
This pin will protect you.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.782
Wow, you really know how to
make your guests feel welcome.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.525
Well now the, uh...

02:14.569 --> 02:15.874
...pleasantries are
out of the way,

02:17.137 --> 02:18.355
don't you think we
should discuss our plan

02:18.399 --> 02:19.922
to take out Supergirl
and her friends?

02:22.403 --> 02:23.273
These rings

02:24.448 --> 02:26.015
bought you a ticket to
board our ship.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.235
So enjoy your photo op.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.499
But leave the slaughter
of Supergirl to us.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.437
Thank you for
letting me in, Kara.

02:58.308 --> 03:01.137
It's been a year
and I still haven't come to
terms with what I did.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.052
Shot my brother and...

03:04.358 --> 03:06.229
I mean, I thought I was
protecting everyone

03:06.273 --> 03:07.404
but it really started
all that--

03:07.448 --> 03:09.319
I don't want to talk
about the past.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.017
All that matters now is

03:12.061 --> 03:13.802
the threat ahead of us and how
we are going to stop it.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.196
Understood.

03:18.459 --> 03:19.590
Get down on the ground, now.

03:19.634 --> 03:20.591
No, Alex, no.

03:20.635 --> 03:21.853
You texted 911.

03:21.897 --> 03:22.941
Not about her.

03:22.985 --> 03:25.335
She's here to help
us stop Lex.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.467
And Leviathan.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.774
Oh.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.863
So Lex and Leviathan
are planning something

03:31.907 --> 03:34.126
using Obsidian virtual
reality platform.

03:34.170 --> 03:36.738
And my tech likely made
that possible.

03:36.781 --> 03:39.828
That must be why
Rama Khan went after the
DEO's Kryptonite.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.612
To keep Supergirl from
interfering.

03:41.656 --> 03:42.918
Well, the joke's on Rama Khan

03:42.961 --> 03:44.876
and his big dumb
gladiator outfit.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.574
Because I have already
defeated him once.

03:46.617 --> 03:47.923
Don't be rash, Kara.

03:47.966 --> 03:49.664
He's tied to the Earth.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.970
Which means he can track
your slightest movements.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.711
If you use your powers
even once,

03:54.625 --> 03:55.452
he will sense them,

03:55.931 --> 03:57.541
and attack.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.456
With all that
Kryptonite at his fingertips,

03:59.500 --> 04:00.805
he could kill you.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.720
You guys will protect me.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.374
Just like we protected the DEO?

04:08.683 --> 04:09.510
It's not checkmate.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.164
Not yet.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.732
I haven't made Kara
an anti-Kryptonite suit
in this world.

04:14.776 --> 04:15.864
But I could.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.474
Just need to get you
safely to my lab.

04:17.517 --> 04:19.171
Your lab is across
the city.

04:19.214 --> 04:21.173
And Kara can't use her powers.

04:21.216 --> 04:23.567
We could get her there.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.177
If we had the right
distraction.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.789
Or the right decoys.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.923
No, no, no way.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.011
Absolutely not.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.057
I can tell those pants
will chafe.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.149
Ugh!
I was right.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.152
I quite like it.

04:43.195 --> 04:45.502
This is just like
the beginning
of Deathly Hallows.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.330
Moody and Hedwig died.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.940
You lost
comrades in battle?

04:48.984 --> 04:50.028
My condolences.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.987
No, it's...

04:52.030 --> 04:53.989
Dreamer and
I will draw Rama Khan out in
Courtney Park.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.513
M'gann, Alex,

04:56.557 --> 04:58.820
you move across the rooftops
to cover us.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.691
While they're distracting
Leviathan,

05:00.735 --> 05:02.432
you and I will make our way
to LuthorCorp.

05:02.476 --> 05:03.303
Come here.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.915
I have to show you something.

05:06.958 --> 05:07.872
Okay. Stay right there.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.795
Oh, my God.

05:17.839 --> 05:18.883
J'onn made it for me.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.148
She looks great.

05:23.192 --> 05:26.543
Oh, it was
a scream of delight.

05:26.587 --> 05:27.805
Thank H'ronmeer.

05:32.549 --> 05:33.942
Well, we should probably
get going.

05:35.726 --> 05:36.945
Stay safe out there.

05:38.947 --> 05:40.644
I know that may not
have been the most

05:40.688 --> 05:42.385
pleasant experience.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.518
But Rama Khan was just
trying to protect the base.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.998
Not only Ram Khan, it seems.

05:47.042 --> 05:49.349
And here I was thinking you
were the top of the food chain.

05:49.392 --> 05:52.874
I answer to another.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.572
Took me a long time
to gain her trust.

05:55.616 --> 05:58.227
Which is why the Unity
Festival must succeed.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.402
I'm yours.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.316
Whatever you need.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.230
Keep it.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.102
You've earned it.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.365
That's why I brought
you to the ship.

06:06.801 --> 06:07.802
You're one of us now.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.894
Today is the last day
of the old era.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.984
Tomorrow the future begins.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.397
Did you get
the ship's location?

06:37.440 --> 06:38.528
Indeed.

06:38.572 --> 06:41.009
But it has a nasty
defense mechanism.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.663
They gave me something
to protect from it.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.361
Give it to me.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.145
Not yet.

06:47.189 --> 06:49.321
We've come all this way...

06:49.365 --> 06:51.019
We have done all
those terrible things,

06:51.062 --> 06:52.716
so that I can sneak up
aboard the Leviathan ship

06:52.760 --> 06:55.110
and upload the mortality
code, so that I can kill
the immortals.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.546
And we shall.

06:56.590 --> 06:59.506
But first, Rama Khan and his
element-bending goons

06:59.549 --> 07:02.160
need to eliminate Supergirl's
friends one by one.

07:03.379 --> 07:04.815
And when she
has nothing left...

07:05.686 --> 07:07.427
they'll slay her, too.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.385
After that you kill the gods.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.474
You think I'm just
gonna sit back

07:11.518 --> 07:13.607
while Leviathan murders
my friends?

07:13.650 --> 07:14.651
Former friends.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.653
And yes, I think you will.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.263
Because if you get on
that ship any sooner,

07:18.307 --> 07:19.308
you'll die with them.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.401
Leviathan
is the enemy, Lex.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.708
Not Supergirl,
not J'onn J'onzz.

07:28.665 --> 07:29.840
-Not Dreamer.
-You're right.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.147
They're heroes.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.454
They would happily sacrifice
themselves to save the world.

07:35.716 --> 07:36.847
Maybe they'll even thank us.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.118
There's no place
I can't find you.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.293
That's where you're wrong.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.039
M'gann you're off the hook.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.171
We've got Rama Khan.

07:56.214 --> 07:57.041
Copy that.

07:57.825 --> 07:58.826
We're on our way.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.397
Wait.

08:06.573 --> 08:07.748
There's someone else.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.359
Another element bender.

08:25.156 --> 08:25.983
Gotcha!

08:32.554 --> 08:34.470
There's more than
one of us, too.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.782
Kara, we got her.

08:55.491 --> 08:56.666
Kara, come on, we've gotta go.

09:17.948 --> 09:18.906
Dreamer.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.168
Dreamer, what happened?

09:23.867 --> 09:24.694
J'onn, no.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.785
Go. Go, go, go.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.673
The suit won't be ready for
at least another few hours.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.849
But I'm doing everything in my
power to speed it along.

09:50.546 --> 09:51.547
Hey.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.592
What happened?

09:52.635 --> 09:53.767
It's just not Rama Khan
out there.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.246
There's three of them.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.987
Each with different
element-bending power.

09:57.031 --> 09:57.858
Where are the others?

09:59.642 --> 10:01.078
J'onn was injured.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.776
M'gann and Dreamer
are taken back to the tower.

10:02.819 --> 10:03.864
I should have been there,

10:03.907 --> 10:05.517
fighting alongside
you, I'm sorry.

10:05.561 --> 10:06.780
Kara, it's okay.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.477
We all still have our ears.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.047
Kelly, hey.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.570
Oh, thank God
I got you.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.006
William texted me last night,

10:16.050 --> 10:18.139
that he was going after
Eve Tessmacher.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.881
I haven't been able to
reach him since.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.622
William went after Eve alone?

10:22.665 --> 10:23.666
No super-hearings.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.059
-Sorry.
-Eve Tessmacher?

10:26.060 --> 10:27.714
She's back?

10:27.757 --> 10:30.020
Look, I'll get to you as
soon as I can.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.240
Hey, if this Eve is
working with Lex,

10:32.283 --> 10:34.198
William has no idea
the danger he is in.

10:34.242 --> 10:35.286
I...

10:35.330 --> 10:36.853
Alex, I have to do something.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.855
I can't just sit here.
I have to help him,

10:38.899 --> 10:40.683
-somehow.
-Okay, listen to me. Stop.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.991
I know how hard it is for you
to sit on the sidelines.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.558
Okay, but Kelly and I,
we will handle this.

10:46.602 --> 10:49.387
We will access Eve's files
at Obsidian North

10:49.431 --> 10:50.693
and we'll see what she's up to.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.826
And if she has gotten
to William, hey.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.742
We will find him.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.658
You just need to stay safe
until Lena finishes your suit.

11:01.748 --> 11:02.879
Okay, all right, fine.

11:02.923 --> 11:05.229
But please, be careful.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.144
You know me.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.624
Yeah, exactly,
that's what I'm worried about.

11:09.451 --> 11:10.321
Come on

11:13.455 --> 11:15.065
Satellite uplink
is nearly ready.

11:16.850 --> 11:17.677
We should launch.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.029
Gemma?

11:28.949 --> 11:30.515
I was communicating with her.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.562
-The news isn't good.
-What is it?

11:33.605 --> 11:36.173
Tezumak managed to
injure one of the Martians.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.522
But Supergirl never even joined

11:37.566 --> 11:39.742
the fight and the others
got away.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.136
I've gambled everything on
this Unity Festival.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.791
Then we have to make sure
it goes off without a hitch.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.097
Lex, Gemma...

11:47.794 --> 11:48.664
It's time.

11:53.147 --> 11:53.974
So?

11:55.323 --> 11:57.325
Shall we begin ending
the world?

12:06.160 --> 12:07.552
Al's dive bar?

12:07.596 --> 12:09.685
This is where you summoned
me at a time like this?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.992
It's the place where you first
gave me this mission.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.429
Work with Lex Luthor.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.518
Defeat Leviathan.

12:17.693 --> 12:18.825
No matter the cost.

12:21.349 --> 12:24.004
Today I will feel the full
extent of that cost.

12:25.005 --> 12:26.397
Querl.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.182
I know things
spun out of control

12:28.225 --> 12:30.184
last time you disobeyed Lex.

12:30.227 --> 12:32.273
But you don't have to do this.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.318
You don't have to let
your friends die.

12:36.146 --> 12:37.931
I don't plan to.

12:37.974 --> 12:41.151
I don't plan on using Lex's
mortality code on the gods,
either.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.285
But how will you defeat them?

12:48.724 --> 12:49.551
By using this.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.991
Rather than kill the gods.

12:55.035 --> 12:57.646
And I shall reclaim
the actions of our ancestors.

12:58.865 --> 12:59.735
For good.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.084
Instead of evil.

13:01.911 --> 13:02.782
I'll shrink them.

13:04.392 --> 13:05.915
I'll bottle them
here in stasis,

13:05.959 --> 13:08.048
where they can harm neither
this planet nor my friends.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.792
But if you enter the ship

13:12.835 --> 13:15.969
without Lex's
anti-radiation pin, you'll...

13:17.927 --> 13:19.755
You'll... You'll die.

13:24.412 --> 13:25.979
I pushed away everyone I loved

13:26.022 --> 13:27.502
because you told me I must.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.026
You were right.

13:31.419 --> 13:32.289
This planet...

13:32.942 --> 13:33.813
my friends...

13:35.249 --> 13:36.076
It's worth it.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.995
I called you here
simply because...

13:45.781 --> 13:47.261
I don't wanna die alone.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.617
Citizens of the world.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.533
Today we stand on the
precipice of history.

13:58.576 --> 14:01.405
Ours is a world of pain,
suffering.

14:01.449 --> 14:04.017
Of conflict, of chaos.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.584
But when you enter
Obsidian's world...

14:06.628 --> 14:09.718
The problems of the real
one melt away.

14:09.761 --> 14:12.677
In virtual reality, there is
nothing to want.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.897
No reason to harm one another.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.987
It's a place where we can be
our best and truest selves.

14:19.293 --> 14:22.035
This world can be
our real world.

14:23.384 --> 14:24.907
And it all starts today.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.649
With the Obsidian
Worldwide Unity Festival.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.507
Oh, nice.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.161
Did someone call for
tech support?

15:05.469 --> 15:06.775
I just said a mask, but...

15:07.994 --> 15:09.604
Wow.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.475
Bummer we have to get to
straight to business.

15:11.519 --> 15:14.261
Yeah, I guess you inspired me.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.958
I could have never
gotten past security.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.178
My girlfriend's a badass.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.832
Breaking into a tech
corps, that's easy.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.530
What I battled earlier today...

15:23.618 --> 15:24.706
These are gods.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.752
I mean, I finally got
this baby working.

15:27.796 --> 15:30.059
But compared to what those
guys are packing...

15:30.103 --> 15:31.539
I might as well have brought
a slingshot.

15:32.453 --> 15:34.934
I've never felt so human.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.242
Oh, wait, wait,
we got something.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.418
Eve's IP address.

15:41.462 --> 15:42.811
-Okay.
-Wait.

15:42.854 --> 15:43.899
It's encrypted.

15:43.943 --> 15:44.856
Better call Lena.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.426
These programs should
be able to crack Eve's cipher
in minutes.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.561
Talk about history
repeating itself.

15:53.604 --> 15:54.910
Tracking Lex down
through Eve...

15:55.737 --> 15:56.912
It's just like Kaznia.

16:01.308 --> 16:02.918
Please, Kara, I'm sorry.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.007
Okay, I truly believed what I
was doing was helping people.

16:05.051 --> 16:08.010
I told you I don't want
to talk about the past.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.794
Oh, come on, you can scream
at me if you'd like.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.927
I know I deserve it.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.929
I know now that working
with Non Nocere was a mistake,
that working with Lex--

16:13.973 --> 16:15.104
This isn't about Lex.

16:16.366 --> 16:17.933
This is about J'onn and Alex

16:17.977 --> 16:19.804
and all the other people that
could have been killed today

16:19.848 --> 16:21.719
because they are on my team.

16:21.763 --> 16:22.894
Don't you understand that?

16:22.938 --> 16:24.331
No, I do, of course I do.

16:24.374 --> 16:25.288
No you don't.

16:25.332 --> 16:26.724
You have never understood

16:26.768 --> 16:28.813
what it means share a secret
identity with someone.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.598
How much danger
that puts them in.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.730
You... You never
even understood

16:32.774 --> 16:36.082
that I kept my identity
from you because I wanted
to protect you.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.737
I know, I know

16:39.781 --> 16:41.391
that I hurt you

16:41.435 --> 16:44.046
by waiting so long
to tell my truth.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.440
But what about all
the ways you hurt me?

16:48.659 --> 16:50.879
You pretended to be my
friend for weeks.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.794
Just so you could
manipulate me.

16:53.403 --> 16:54.535
You stole from me.

16:54.578 --> 16:56.493
You convinced me to
steal for you.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.800
And then, then, you even...

17:00.193 --> 17:01.759
You used Kryptonite on me.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.025
I made one mistake.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.505
One mistake

17:08.549 --> 17:10.724
that was only ever meant
to protect you.

17:10.768 --> 17:12.074
And in return,

17:12.117 --> 17:15.469
all you did was hurt me
in every way imaginable.

17:21.431 --> 17:22.258
I'm sorry.

17:22.301 --> 17:23.128
I know you are.

17:24.913 --> 17:27.655
But if you came to me looking
for absolution,

17:28.525 --> 17:29.483
I can't give it to you.

17:34.488 --> 17:35.402
It's Eve's location.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.187
I'm going.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.275
No, Kara, your suit
isn't ready yet.

17:39.319 --> 17:40.450
I don't care.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.278
Protecting people is what I do.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.366
You should know that by now.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.891
Then I'm going with you.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.632
Now that you're up,
you better start talking.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.026
Why were you following me?

17:51.070 --> 17:54.508
I'm pursuing a story
on Lex Luthor.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.423
I know he is up to something
criminal.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.121
I don't know your
involvement.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.080
But I believe you've been
working for him.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.386
You have no idea what
you have gotten yourself into.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.909
You should have
stayed out of it.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.085
Now I have no choice.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.307
I'm a journalist.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.266
Okay, I can read people.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.877
You're a good person who
looks trapped.

18:17.183 --> 18:18.749
It's clear you're not
a killer.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.665
What does he have with you?

18:21.709 --> 18:24.364
Did he threaten someone
you care about?

18:28.890 --> 18:29.717
My mother.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.506
I am so sorry.

18:36.550 --> 18:37.942
But you don't have
to fight this alone.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.815
I can help you
and your mother.

18:42.295 --> 18:45.733
We can bring
the truth to light.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.433
If the truth comes to light,
my mother is dead.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.350
Eve, please.

18:54.394 --> 18:55.917
I really am so sorry.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.362
It's okay. I've got you.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.674
Okay. The bullet went
through and through

19:13.717 --> 19:15.415
through but we still need to
get you to a hospital.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.373
No, no, no,
he's losing to much blood.
There's no time.

19:17.982 --> 19:19.158
Okay.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.420
I can cauterize it but it's
gonna hurt.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.030
-Do it, do it.
-All right.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.119
Don't do it.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.729
Too late, too late. It's done.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.035
-You okay?

19:27.601 --> 19:29.559
Yes, it just hurt.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.040
All right,
what happened here?

19:32.083 --> 19:33.259
I was following a lead.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.086
Got jumped.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.046
Ah, Reporting 101.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.918
If you get kidnapped,
you must be on the right track.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.138
-Something Kara Danvers
likes to say.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.619
She was working the case
with me.

19:45.662 --> 19:47.403
I need to make sure
she is all right.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.318
Kara is fine.

19:49.362 --> 19:50.885
I spoke to her,
she's in a safe place.

20:03.550 --> 20:04.942
Get William and Eve
out of here.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.074
I'll deal with this.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.467
Are you mad?
They've got Kryptonite.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.033
Well, then you'd better get
that suit here fast.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.252
It's already on its way.

20:10.296 --> 20:11.340
And I'll call for back-up.

20:16.780 --> 20:17.607
Kill her.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.201
Did someone call
for backup?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.899
Now it's a fair fight.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.641
Couldn't let you have
all the fun.

20:51.685 --> 20:54.122
Can't believe you
left to play earth, wind and
fire without us.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.143
They're...

21:16.187 --> 21:17.145
They're gone.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.277
The explosion killed them.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.285
We have to get out of here.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.155
Now.

22:02.930 --> 22:05.889
Let's replenish ourselves and
finish this once and for all.

22:10.590 --> 22:13.767
That's when their bodies
started to reform like
out of a horror movie.

22:13.810 --> 22:14.811
Yeah, but that means...

22:14.855 --> 22:16.117
They're indestructible.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.161
Immortal.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.775
This isn't about defeating
them anymore.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.213
They want us to fight
until we drop.

22:25.256 --> 22:28.085
So they can distract us from
whatever Lex is planning.

22:28.129 --> 22:29.260
Do we even know what that is?

22:30.392 --> 22:31.306
I'm gonna go find out.

22:32.438 --> 22:33.308
Eve.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.789
Eve, can you hear me?

22:41.011 --> 22:42.622
-Is the reporter okay?
-Yes.

22:42.665 --> 22:44.275
He told us everything.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.148
Please understand...

22:47.191 --> 22:49.455
I was just trying to protect
my mom.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.893
Now Lex is gonna kill her.

22:52.936 --> 22:55.199
I know you must feel
like there is no way out.

22:55.243 --> 22:58.594
But it is when things feel
their most hopeless

22:58.638 --> 23:00.161
that we have to dig down deep

23:00.204 --> 23:01.162
to do what is right.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.339
Otherwise the bad guys win.

23:05.166 --> 23:05.993
Help us, Eve.

23:07.124 --> 23:09.170
Help us fight.

23:09.213 --> 23:12.478
And I promise I will do
everything in my power to keep
you and your mom safe.

23:18.484 --> 23:21.312
Gemma Cooper is not
who she says she is.

23:22.575 --> 23:25.447
Her real name is Gamemnae.

23:25.491 --> 23:29.451
She is a member of Leviathan,
just like Rama Khan.

23:29.495 --> 23:32.846
Tonight they are planning
to attack the Unity Festival.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.935
Once all four million
subscribers are inside...

23:36.415 --> 23:37.590
Gemma will kill them all.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.513
I recommend the chocos.

23:48.688 --> 23:49.515
How's J'onn?

23:50.385 --> 23:51.212
Recovering.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.562
You can't fool a sidekick.

23:53.606 --> 23:56.173
I saw you hesitate
during the fight.

23:56.217 --> 23:57.218
You dreamed something.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.351
And it terrified you.

24:00.395 --> 24:01.222
What did you see?

24:03.485 --> 24:04.486
Brainy.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.792
You two were couple, right?

24:08.795 --> 24:10.492
You know J'onn.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.363
For a deeply serious man,
he's got a big mouth.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.235
I know.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.501
It was more than
a relationship.

24:21.416 --> 24:22.330
We were partners.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.506
We...

24:24.550 --> 24:26.334
protected each other.

24:26.377 --> 24:29.206
Turns out that one thing I
couldn't protect him from
was himself.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.211
I told him to take
off those inhibitors.

24:36.039 --> 24:38.738
Maybe these dreams
are because of my guilt.

24:38.781 --> 24:42.611
There may be more to what he's
going through than you know.

24:42.655 --> 24:45.396
When J'onn discovered
that I was a White Martian.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.094
He thought the worst of me.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.620
Until he finally saw my soul.

24:51.664 --> 24:52.882
I'm not a telepath.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.580
No, you're a dreamer.

24:55.406 --> 24:56.538
And like it or not,

24:56.582 --> 24:57.539
you're dreaming now.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.106
You have to engage with it.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.588
It could have meaning
far deeper

25:03.327 --> 25:04.938
than you realize.

25:04.981 --> 25:06.940
I'm sorry M'gann, I need to be
keeping Brainy out of my mind,

25:06.983 --> 25:08.071
not letting him in.

25:10.639 --> 25:13.947
There is nearly
a billion people logged into
the Unity Fest already.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.165
Can we shut down
the system?

25:15.209 --> 25:16.558
Or destroy it somehow?

25:16.602 --> 25:18.125
No.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.649
The Luthor power core
has an indestructible
fail safe.

25:20.693 --> 25:24.087
So, you're saying
we need to convince potentially
billions of people

25:24.131 --> 25:28.222
to log out of virtual
reality paradise of their
own free will.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.659
Hope you've got one of those
classic hope speeches handy.

25:32.182 --> 25:34.010
I mean, I've done it before
but never on this level.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.534
Oh, if anyone can do it,
it's you.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.363
Jinx.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.452
All right, so what do we
do about Leviathan?

25:41.496 --> 25:43.585
We'll fight till
our last breath.

25:43.629 --> 25:46.022
J'onn, are you sure?

25:46.066 --> 25:48.416
With you by my side, 100%.

25:48.459 --> 25:50.505
Well, we'll need
to do something to drive
Leviathan out.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.247
I'll send them a message.

25:53.290 --> 25:55.118
-What are you going to say?
-Something to get
their attention.

25:59.470 --> 26:02.430
That arrogant Martian thinks
he can speak to me like that?

26:02.865 --> 26:03.736
I'm a god!

26:06.521 --> 26:09.002
Once we're done with
this world, I'll turn to
Mars next.

26:17.532 --> 26:18.664
Now's your chance.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.255
Place your hand on
the central terminal.

26:45.299 --> 26:46.909
You'll be able to upload
the shrink code.

27:00.706 --> 27:03.970
Now you can't
move your hand or else you
have to start over.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.544
The upload will take
ten minutes.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.199
I don't know if I can
last that long.

27:16.243 --> 27:17.548
You can.

27:17.592 --> 27:18.811
I'll be with you
the whole way.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.606
Kelly opened
the back door
into the festival.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.129
It should help protect you
from the kill switch.

27:33.173 --> 27:34.435
Hopefully we get everyone out

27:34.478 --> 27:35.610
before Lex and Gemma hit it.

27:35.654 --> 27:36.480
You will.

27:40.006 --> 27:40.833
Let's do this.

27:46.055 --> 27:46.882
Wow.

27:48.492 --> 27:50.233
This is amazing.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.541
I've never seen
anything like this.

27:55.238 --> 27:57.023
No wonder so many people
signed up.

28:09.949 --> 28:12.212
There's still no
sign of them.

28:12.255 --> 28:13.430
Guess they didn't
take the bait.

28:14.780 --> 28:15.824
Maybe you should have
been meaner.

28:18.958 --> 28:19.785
Ah...

28:21.743 --> 28:22.701
-No.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.748
I was just mean enough.

28:32.362 --> 28:34.147
What? No Supergirl?

28:34.190 --> 28:35.975
Let's see if we can't
convince her to join us.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.503
- What's wrong?
-Supergirl.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.854
She's inside
the Unity Festival.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.726
We need to hit
the kill switch.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.292
Wipe out as many people
as possible.

28:49.336 --> 28:50.641
before she has a chance
to interfere.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.556
There aren't any enough
people logged in yet.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.428
We need to get 50% saturation.

28:54.471 --> 28:57.170
What good is wiping out
one quarter of the world

28:57.213 --> 28:58.867
if the other three quarters
rise up against us.

28:58.911 --> 29:00.608
We'll worry about that
problem tomorrow.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.131
This is about tomorrow.

29:02.175 --> 29:04.917
You told me you answer
to a higher power.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.006
How will she feel

29:07.049 --> 29:09.225
when you give in on
the mission before
it's complete?

29:11.053 --> 29:15.057
And if Supergirl is in
the Unity festival,

29:15.101 --> 29:17.146
then her physical body
is vulnerable.

29:18.017 --> 29:19.279
Rama Khan, Tezumak and Sela

29:19.322 --> 29:20.802
might be able to
make it back in time.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.499
They need to take out
Supergirl's friends.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.110
Then what do you propose?

29:24.153 --> 29:25.415
Send another assassin.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.201
Someone who won't fail you.

29:33.510 --> 29:34.816
Hi.

29:34.860 --> 29:39.212
We are nearing
two billion simultaneous users.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.475
Our dreams are finally
a reality.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.521
Not just our dreams, Andrea.

29:44.565 --> 29:45.827
Your father's.

29:45.871 --> 29:46.741
Hm.

29:47.742 --> 29:48.874
And Leviathan's.

29:51.877 --> 29:52.747
Leviathan?

29:53.835 --> 29:54.836
How do you know that name?

29:54.880 --> 29:56.751
Because I am Leviathan.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.930
What does that mean?

30:01.974 --> 30:04.672
All I know is that Leviathan
rescued me that day
in the cave.

30:04.715 --> 30:07.370
It was I who rescued you.

30:07.414 --> 30:09.895
And I have been looking
out for you every day since.

30:12.332 --> 30:14.073
But now I need your help.

30:15.335 --> 30:16.466
Yes.

30:16.510 --> 30:17.859
Yes, of course, anything.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.643
There is great power in you.

30:21.602 --> 30:22.690
I know you feel it.

30:23.473 --> 30:24.997
The power of shadows.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.522
I need you to use that power...

30:30.654 --> 30:31.873
to kill Supergirl.

30:33.788 --> 30:34.615
What?

30:35.921 --> 30:37.226
No. I don't...

30:38.445 --> 30:39.315
I can't.

30:39.359 --> 30:40.316
Yes, you can.

30:41.709 --> 30:42.928
And when you do,

30:42.971 --> 30:46.148
you'll have power beyond
your wildest dreams.

30:46.192 --> 30:48.237
And your company
will be untouchable.

30:50.457 --> 30:52.372
If you don't,

30:52.415 --> 30:54.461
your company will collapse.

30:54.504 --> 30:55.723
You will lose everything.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.946
Your father will be crushed.

31:02.425 --> 31:05.211
We both know he won't be
able to survive the blow.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.264
Everyone listen to me.

31:15.308 --> 31:17.266
There is something wrong
with the program.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.573
You need to end
the simulation now.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.096
What are you
talking about?

31:21.140 --> 31:24.230
There is no one in here but
my late husband.

31:24.273 --> 31:27.059
It's so good to hear his voice.

31:28.669 --> 31:29.713
Hey. Hey, kid.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.978
Kid, can you hear me?

31:33.021 --> 31:35.110
You need to disengage
from the program.

31:35.154 --> 31:36.546
Leave me alone.

31:36.590 --> 31:37.721
My mom is back.

31:38.331 --> 31:39.158
I missed her.

31:39.723 --> 31:41.029
It's...

31:41.073 --> 31:42.901
It's not working.

31:42.944 --> 31:45.860
There are too many people,
they feel connected to their
loved ones.

31:46.643 --> 31:47.906
It's spiritual.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.690
I have no idea how to
break through to them.

31:49.733 --> 31:51.561
I think I can give you a way
to talk to everyone at once.

31:51.605 --> 31:52.867
-Try now.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.393
I need
you all to listen to me.

31:57.437 --> 31:58.481
You're in danger.

32:05.010 --> 32:07.882
If you and I fan out to the
side we can draw their fire.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.623
While you two attack
through the middle.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.668
-Sound good?
-Why not?

32:11.712 --> 32:13.322
-You ready?
-Nope.

32:13.366 --> 32:14.193
Me neither.

32:14.715 --> 32:15.585
Let's go.

32:42.308 --> 32:43.178
Five more minutes.

32:45.180 --> 32:46.225
Stay focused.

33:02.067 --> 33:02.937
Andrea.

33:03.894 --> 33:04.808
The medallion.

33:06.419 --> 33:07.855
You've been activated.

33:07.898 --> 33:10.553
If I don't kill Supergirl,
they'll kill my father.

33:10.597 --> 33:13.295
I know it can be addictive,

33:13.339 --> 33:15.689
to live in a perfect place
where nothing hurts.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.213
But that's not reality.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.171
Killing for them...

33:20.737 --> 33:22.957
Going down this path,
it won't keep him safe.

33:23.827 --> 33:24.828
How do you know?

33:24.872 --> 33:26.091
Because I've been down
it before.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.136
We all get hurt.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.486
But it's only by going
through that pain

33:30.530 --> 33:32.706
that we're able to appreciate
the good.

33:33.794 --> 33:35.926
Pain is what helps us grow.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.624
Without it, we'd never
be able to...

33:38.581 --> 33:41.454
To evolve, to overcome.

33:44.152 --> 33:45.588
To forgive.

33:45.632 --> 33:47.982
I have done terrible things

33:48.026 --> 33:50.028
to protect myself and
the people I love.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.204
But it has never kept
me safe from pain.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.206
It's just brought me
a new kind of misery.

33:56.817 --> 33:58.688
And I moved further
and further

33:58.732 --> 34:00.864
away from the person
I was, until one day

34:00.908 --> 34:02.736
I woke up
and I was utterly alone.

34:04.738 --> 34:06.914
Each of us came here
because we are afraid.

34:08.132 --> 34:09.873
I'm afraid of getting hurt,

34:09.917 --> 34:11.266
just like you.

34:11.310 --> 34:12.963
And I do everything I can

34:13.007 --> 34:15.226
to escape pain, just like you.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.926
But the cost of escape
is too great.

34:22.842 --> 34:23.670
Years ago...

34:25.324 --> 34:26.629
we made a promise
to each other.

34:27.717 --> 34:28.849
You jump, I jump.

34:30.545 --> 34:32.331
If you choose to go down
this path...

34:36.117 --> 34:36.987
I will be there.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.385
If you want to get
to Supergirl,

34:45.039 --> 34:46.388
you're gonna have to
go through me.

34:49.043 --> 34:50.262
We have to wake up now.

34:52.612 --> 34:54.396
We need to end the simulation

34:54.440 --> 34:55.702
once and for all.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.488
I believe in you.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.321
I believe in you.

35:06.365 --> 35:07.409
I believe in you.

35:14.808 --> 35:15.896
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

35:18.246 --> 35:19.117
It's okay.

35:22.555 --> 35:23.904
It's okay.

35:23.947 --> 35:25.210
End simulation.

35:26.907 --> 35:28.474
End simulation.

35:29.344 --> 35:30.650
End simulation.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.043
End simulation.

35:46.231 --> 35:47.101
Go...

35:47.841 --> 35:48.668
on...

35:57.677 --> 35:59.331
I had hoped
you'd die screaming.

36:00.723 --> 36:02.116
But I'll take what I can get.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.782
What have you done?

36:21.527 --> 36:22.354
I...

36:22.919 --> 36:23.746
beat...

36:24.791 --> 36:25.618
you.

36:31.319 --> 36:32.190
What's happening?

36:37.804 --> 36:38.761
The Coluan.

36:47.466 --> 36:49.250
I never thought
I'd see the day.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.469
Obsidian Platinum,

36:50.512 --> 36:52.122
the most popular
VR platform ever created.

36:52.166 --> 36:54.342
And not a single person
is using it.

36:58.085 --> 36:59.521
Alex called...

36:59.565 --> 37:01.828
Leviathan has disappeared.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.090
You did what you
said you would.

37:03.482 --> 37:05.048
Almost.

37:05.092 --> 37:06.398
I still have one promise
left to keep.

37:10.097 --> 37:11.098
You did it, Querl.

37:11.838 --> 37:13.231
You did it.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.493
You saved this world.

37:15.407 --> 37:16.364
You saved your friends.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.413
Will you...

37:23.066 --> 37:24.546
...stay with me?

37:32.206 --> 37:33.686
Till the very end.

37:38.734 --> 37:39.561
Nia.

37:42.216 --> 37:44.697
Who do you think you are?

37:46.176 --> 37:48.353
We had a plan.

37:48.396 --> 37:51.051
Leviathan kills Supergirl
and you kill Leviathan.

37:51.094 --> 37:52.922
And together we
save this planet

37:52.966 --> 37:54.315
from the invulnerable aliens,

37:54.359 --> 37:57.666
who think they know
what's best for mankind.

37:57.710 --> 38:00.321
Why couldn't you just wait

38:00.365 --> 38:02.497
for Supergirl to die?

38:05.239 --> 38:06.893
Underestimated me.

38:09.243 --> 38:10.070
My friends.

38:11.898 --> 38:14.857
I'd never let you kill them.

38:19.906 --> 38:22.343
No, Braniac 5.

38:22.387 --> 38:25.128
Uh, I underestimate nothing.

38:25.172 --> 38:28.349
I knew you would decide to
shrink the gods
instead of kill them

38:28.393 --> 38:30.308
due to your precious
moral code.

38:30.351 --> 38:31.918
I planned for that.

38:31.961 --> 38:34.921
I just didn't think that
you would kill yourself.

38:37.097 --> 38:38.185
Well...

38:38.228 --> 38:39.708
Supergirl lives.

38:39.752 --> 38:40.753
But, I have the ball.

38:41.493 --> 38:42.711
No...

38:42.755 --> 38:44.409
You gave me exactly...

38:45.758 --> 38:46.585
what I needed.

38:49.936 --> 38:51.416
I'm just gonna kill
Supergirl myself.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.200
It'll be fun.

38:54.636 --> 38:55.724
And you...

38:56.943 --> 38:57.944
can die alone.

38:58.858 --> 38:59.815
Just like you intended.

39:16.005 --> 39:17.442
No, no, no, Brainy.

39:21.141 --> 39:22.447
I should have listened to you.

39:24.013 --> 39:24.971
It's Brainy.

39:25.972 --> 39:27.016
He stopped Leviathan.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.454
He saved us.

39:32.413 --> 39:33.327
He needs my help.

39:33.849 --> 39:34.763
Oh...

39:36.112 --> 39:36.939
Oh, my God.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.552
It's actually you.

39:47.472 --> 39:49.169
In the last world,
she betrayed us.

39:51.519 --> 39:53.826
We may never know what
was driving her, but...

39:55.828 --> 39:57.177
I do know what was
driving you.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.224
You didn't want to tell me
who you really were

40:01.268 --> 40:02.704
because you didn't want
me to get hurt.

40:05.577 --> 40:07.622
But I did get hurt.

40:07.666 --> 40:09.972
And I did what I always do
when people hurt me.

40:10.016 --> 40:11.626
I...

40:11.670 --> 40:13.672
built a wall and I suffocated
behind it.

40:16.849 --> 40:19.765
Makes it very difficult to
see things from other people's
point of view.

40:23.116 --> 40:24.334
But I see yours now.

40:25.510 --> 40:28.034
And I am very sorry it
took me so long.

40:32.168 --> 40:34.649
You know, when you showed
up at my door this morning I...

40:34.693 --> 40:36.042
I didn't wanna let you in.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.654
And I kept waiting for
you to let me down.

40:42.614 --> 40:44.354
But at every turn you
came through.

40:45.878 --> 40:46.966
Building that suit.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.970
Protecting my identity,
supporting me.

40:54.364 --> 40:56.410
I wasn't ready to accept
your apology.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.675
But maybe,
maybe I am now.

41:07.639 --> 41:08.466
Okay.

41:11.425 --> 41:13.209
What now?

41:13.253 --> 41:15.951
Well, there is one bad guy
left to catch.

41:17.605 --> 41:18.911
Let's go take
my brother down.

41:35.623 --> 41:36.624
Let's get to work, Doc.

41:39.758 --> 41:40.933
Right away, dear.
