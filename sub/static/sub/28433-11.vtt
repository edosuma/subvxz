than worrying.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.302
Wait a second.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.608
Did you...
actually stop worrying?

17:24.739 --> 17:26.219
Yeah.
You told me to.

17:26.349 --> 17:27.133
Huh.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.135
Jeff, sit down.

17:29.265 --> 17:30.962
Stand up.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.399
-Be happy.
-[chuckles]

17:32.529 --> 17:34.009
-Be sad.
-[whimpers]

17:34.140 --> 17:35.271
Be Larry King.

17:35.402 --> 17:36.794
[deep voice]
Boston, you're on the air.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.231
Stan! Come here!

17:38.361 --> 17:39.406
STAN: You can't tell me
what to do!

17:39.536 --> 17:42.496
Exactly.
He neverdoes what I say.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.237
But youdo!

17:44.367 --> 17:46.282
Pack your bags.
We're going to get Hayley.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.762
[normal voice]
Gotcha, Mrs. S!

17:47.892 --> 17:49.720
Wait.
Pack mybags, too.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.158
Will do. How many staplers
do you want to bring?

17:52.288 --> 17:55.161
Never mind.
I'll pack for both of us.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.163
Like with
all my Barry Manilow albums,

17:57.293 --> 17:59.208
there's really gonna
be room for staplers.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.299
More deserters.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.171
We're the last two men
at the Alamo.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.651
Rogu love dessert.

18:07.782 --> 18:10.567
Remember the a la mode.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.569
Rogu, everything's a joke
to you,

18:12.700 --> 18:14.136
and I don't mind that.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.791
♪♪

18:16.921 --> 18:20.186
Why so weepy,
Meryl Streepy?

18:20.316 --> 18:22.318
Well, the fight was fun,
and it was cool

18:22.449 --> 18:24.407
when that nun started
swinging that chain around,

18:24.538 --> 18:26.192
but now
I just feel empty.

18:26.322 --> 18:29.804
I miss Jeff, even if
he canbe a pain in the ass.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.240
I'm going home.

18:31.371 --> 18:32.981
You're not going
anywhere.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.374
You broke my jukebox.

18:34.504 --> 18:36.245
You have to work off
what you owe me --

18:36.376 --> 18:39.118
4,500 Irish Money Units.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.163
Well,
that's a bummer...

18:41.294 --> 18:42.556
...Christopher Plummer.

18:42.686 --> 18:43.774
JEFF: Babe!

18:43.905 --> 18:45.080
Jeff!

18:45.211 --> 18:46.429
What are you guys
doing here?

18:46.560 --> 18:48.257
I came to say
I'm sorry.

18:48.388 --> 18:49.432
For what?

18:49.563 --> 18:51.130
For giving you
bad advice.

18:51.260 --> 18:54.350
I told you the only way
to be happy in your marriage

18:54.481 --> 18:56.135
was to have an escape.

18:56.265 --> 18:57.614
But that's mymarriage.

18:57.745 --> 19:01.009
When your dad annoys me,
I can't stop him.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.619
That's why
I have to get away.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.361
But Jeff --
if hestarts to annoy you,

19:05.492 --> 19:06.667
just tell him
what you want.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.190
It's not that simple,
Mrs. S.

19:08.321 --> 19:09.191
Corner.

19:09.322 --> 19:10.932
Love to be where
those two walls meet!

19:11.062 --> 19:13.587
See? You're gonna be happy
when you come home

19:13.717 --> 19:15.719
if you just tell Jeff
what to do.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.068
Now let's go.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.374
BARTENDER:
She can't go anywhere.

19:18.505 --> 19:21.638
Not until I get
my 4,500 McBucks.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.640
This dude's hella dead.

19:23.771 --> 19:25.251
Hold my Fitbit.

19:25.381 --> 19:28.167
Actually, no. I want credit
for this ass-kicking.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.299
JEFF [chuckling]:Are you guys seeing this corner?

19:30.430 --> 19:31.170
Wait a second, Mom.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.084
Maybe
there's another way.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.870
Hi. I'm Jeff. I work here
because my wife asked me to.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.393
I'm not allowed
to bring up leprechauns.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.308
Can I take your order?

19:39.439 --> 19:41.397
That was good, but you still
mentioned the leprechauns.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.747
I saw one in the urinal!
It bit me!

19:43.878 --> 19:45.184
I think you're right.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.316
Jeff will do fine
working off your debt.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.231
And all you had to do
was tell him to.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.190
Thanks for
taking my place.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.496
I love you.
Remember that.

19:53.627 --> 19:55.194
And that's
a Goddamn order.

19:55.324 --> 19:56.847
I love you, too.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.459
Because I may be
a moron...

20:02.201 --> 20:03.332
Yes?

20:03.506 --> 20:04.638
Yes.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.559
Mom, you're back!

20:12.689 --> 20:14.256
Enemy reinforcements,
Rogu.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.302
The Alamo
must not fall!

20:17.607 --> 20:21.872
Rogu going to Hell,
but he not going alone.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.309
[screaming manically]

20:23.439 --> 20:25.441
One more drink
at O'Rrivals?

20:25.572 --> 20:26.486
Why stop at one?

20:26.616 --> 20:28.357
ROGU:
