00:00.867 --> 00:03.802
Now you've got an Asian son
and an Asian enemy.

00:05.605 --> 00:07.903
Where is the boy, Coy O'Brien?
I don't know.

00:07.974 --> 00:10.306
These characters believe they're
supposed to rule the world.

00:10.377 --> 00:12.743
Well, you better make sure this
guy, Tanika, doesn't get me.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.478
You think you have won...

00:16.549 --> 00:19.677
but you have yet to face
the spirit of the Kamikaze.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.550
Keep your eyes open, your backs
covered, and keep swinging. Let's go.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.320
What the hell was that?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:43.543 --> 00:46.034
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

00:46.112 --> 00:48.580
into the dangerous world
of a man...

00:48.648 --> 00:50.513
who does not exist.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.823
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:00.894 --> 01:03.590
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:03.663 --> 01:05.790
the helpless, the powerless...

01:05.865 --> 01:08.800
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.098
They're ready.
Proceed with the mission.

02:59.412 --> 03:02.347
This dude, Nick O'Brien,
what's his tie to Devon?

03:02.415 --> 03:04.440
He's been a close friend
for years.

03:04.517 --> 03:08.578
O'Brien served with Devon on the Allied
Command in Korea in the early '50s.

03:09.088 --> 03:11.682
You got any idea what kind
of jackpot this guy is in?

03:11.758 --> 03:15.319
All I know is we are not here
to send KITT to the Far East...

03:15.395 --> 03:18.159
and have him come back as
a crate of ghetto blasters.

03:18.231 --> 03:20.722
Michael, your analogy
is quite disturbing.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.292
Hey, don't worry, KITT. I am a
strong advocate of "buy American".

03:24.370 --> 03:26.361
I wouldn't buy you
if you had a foreign label.

03:26.439 --> 03:28.100
That's very patriotic of you,
RC.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.232
Thanks, KITT.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.937
Now, if you'd just work
on your taste in music.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.777
Knight, I'll be right down!

04:10.416 --> 04:13.544
I'm sure glad he's coming
down instead of us going up.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.546
Since when have you been
afraid of heights?

04:16.623 --> 04:18.921
Ever since the South Side
Skulls trapped me on a roof...

04:18.992 --> 04:21.688
and I had to do a swan dive
into a snow bank to escape.

04:22.462 --> 04:23.895
That could do it.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.587
Well...

04:27.233 --> 04:28.791
let's get right to it, gents.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.632
The bottom line is somebody's
trying to destroy my business.

04:31.704 --> 04:34.764
You're sure it's not just the normal
pressures of business competition?

04:34.841 --> 04:39.369
Look, spreading rumors about
massive layoffs isn't normal.

04:40.246 --> 04:43.738
Neither is telling all my suppliers
that I'm a lousy credit risk.

04:43.816 --> 04:44.805
Whoa.

04:44.884 --> 04:47.182
So, whoever's hitting you
is hitting you below the belt.

04:47.253 --> 04:49.983
Right. See,
I don't mind a good fight.

04:50.423 --> 04:54.359
It gives my men a chance to show that
they're the best craftsmen in the world.

04:54.427 --> 04:56.258
We can't compete
with somebody...

04:56.329 --> 04:59.423
who's willing to lose
millions just to destroy us.

04:59.565 --> 05:03.695
See, this guy, Tanika, doesn't
want to build in this country...

05:03.870 --> 05:06.031
he just wants to wipe out
what's here.

05:06.105 --> 05:07.800
That's a tall order.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.774
Hey, this is quite an
operation you got here.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.275
Yeah.

05:11.344 --> 05:12.504
See...

05:12.712 --> 05:15.340
my men are
as much this company as I am.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.344
Jobs pass from fathers
to sons.

05:18.751 --> 05:23.017
I can always cash out and retire. But
there's hundreds of them that can't.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.980
All right, Nick, we'll try and
help, but we've got to prove...

05:26.059 --> 05:28.687
that there's more to this than
just irregular business practice.

05:28.761 --> 05:29.785
Hey...

05:29.862 --> 05:32.387
a man can't ask for any more
than what's fair.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.394
What the hell was that?

05:37.837 --> 05:39.395
KITT, talk to me.
What's going on?

05:39.472 --> 05:41.406
Michael, my scanners detect
four men...

05:41.474 --> 05:44.602
heading toward the main offices
at the other end of the yard.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.612
Coy, my son. He's in there.
He comes in after school.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.614
All right,
head for the offices.

05:53.586 --> 05:54.746
Get me security!

06:28.554 --> 06:31.614
Something tells me
these are the bad guys.

06:31.691 --> 06:33.522
Something tells me
you're right.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.968
Michael, there are
two more of them inside.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.637
Security breach in Complex A.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.373
Keep on them.
I'll check on the kid.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.416
Retreat. Security breach
in Complex A.

07:50.236 --> 07:53.728
For guys that ain't hard
hats, you have very good moves.

07:54.707 --> 07:57.471
Thanks. I'm looking
for Coy O'Brien.

07:58.611 --> 08:01.136
You found him. Nick O'Brien...

08:01.214 --> 08:03.580
the big guy who runs
this place, is my dad.

08:08.621 --> 08:11.681
Some boy you got there, Nick. How
did the two of you meet up, anyway?

08:11.757 --> 08:14.157
Fifteen years ago,
I went back to Japan.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.525
First time
since I was in the army.

08:16.729 --> 08:17.957
You know...

08:18.030 --> 08:21.591
at some point I had this
feeling I was being watched.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.437
And I was. By a woman
with a one-year-old baby.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.139
Coy?
Yeah.

08:28.574 --> 08:31.168
She wanted me to take
him back to the States.

08:31.811 --> 08:34.405
She kept saying
something about...

08:34.947 --> 08:37.745
evil designs or plans...

08:37.817 --> 08:41.183
you know, between her
English and my Japanese.

08:41.654 --> 08:43.815
Anyway, I put them in a hotel.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.948
I went to check out her story
and I came up empty.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.358
When I got back, she was gone.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.960
So you adopted Coy
and raised him as your son.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.056
Yeah.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.601
Now you have an Asian son
and an Asian enemy.

08:56.836 --> 08:59.304
Yeah, this time
Tanika's gone too far.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.405
He wants to destroy my
business, that's one thing.

09:02.775 --> 09:05.369
But if he wants to jeopardize
my son, that's something else.

09:05.444 --> 09:09.175
Nick, Tanika is a very,
very powerful man.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.609
How hard
do you want to fight?

09:11.851 --> 09:14.877
I mean, how far are you
willing to go? All the way.

09:15.288 --> 09:18.780
I'm willing to lose everything
except my son.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.055
I believe that.

09:22.628 --> 09:23.617
All right.

09:24.196 --> 09:26.892
I'll check out a few things,
then I'll get back to you.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.792
Fight's on.
All right.

09:38.177 --> 09:39.769
KITT, get me Devon.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.373
I've heard, Michael.
What do you need?

09:42.882 --> 09:45.476
Every piece of information,
business and personal...

09:45.551 --> 09:49.112
that you can get me
on industrialist, Suki Tanika.

09:49.188 --> 09:52.885
I've already got Bonnie working
on accessing Tanika's database.

10:03.135 --> 10:06.195
Have you discovered who owns
the strange black vehicle?

10:06.739 --> 10:08.764
It belongs
to an agency called...

10:08.841 --> 10:11.002
The Foundation
for Law and Government.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.738
The driver was Michael Knight.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.780
We have drawn
strong opponents, Gobi.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.577
But it is better
to test steel against steel.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.618
We miscalculated.

10:19.719 --> 10:22.916
O'Brien's sphere of power
is larger than expected.

10:23.723 --> 10:27.090
How else could he call upon
resources of this foundation?

10:27.660 --> 10:29.651
We must double our efforts.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.926
That child is still the key.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.370
So what you're telling me...

10:45.444 --> 10:47.810
is Tanika is trying to revive
the Uyoku cult.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.108
Well, the agencies...

10:49.181 --> 10:50.978
in the Far East
have long suspected it.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.075
But, Tanika has yet to do
anything visible...

10:53.152 --> 10:55.677
that would allow the
authorities to take action.

10:55.755 --> 10:59.088
What's the story
on these Uyoku dudes, anyway?

10:59.258 --> 11:00.987
Well, they were
a terrorist cult...

11:01.060 --> 11:03.585
abolished by the Allied
Command after the war.

11:04.296 --> 11:05.786
It's still illegal in Japan.

11:05.865 --> 11:08.333
Kamikazes were Uyokus.
The death squads were Uyokus.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.234
These characters believe they're
supposed to rule the world.

11:11.303 --> 11:13.464
They make the Nazis
look like Good Humor men.

11:13.539 --> 11:16.303
Where are you going?
To check out Tanika.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.778
When he gets in that kind of mood, he's
usually headed for the eye of the storm.

11:31.857 --> 11:36.021
In that case, would you get on that machine
that you call a motorbike and follow him?

11:36.228 --> 11:39.823
Stay close by him in case he
needs you. But don't crowd him.

11:40.099 --> 11:41.088
Right.

11:56.615 --> 11:58.640
Michael, this man
Tanika's sentiments...

11:58.718 --> 12:00.310
may be from another century.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.980
But he works amidst
state-of-the-art security.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.249
Can we breach it?

12:04.323 --> 12:05.756
Yes, but what do you
hope to find?

12:05.825 --> 12:07.622
Hooded ninja
walking the hallways?

12:07.693 --> 12:10.787
I don't know, anything is more
than what we got now.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.160
It's your move.

12:16.602 --> 12:19.594
There is a sensitive infrared
system on the ground level.

12:19.672 --> 12:22.197
The second level looks more
vulnerable. That's correct.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.071
But getting up there
is another matter.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.873
All right.
We use the overpass.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.182
Okay, pal.

12:42.394 --> 12:45.295
I need a little help
about 25 feet up.

12:45.564 --> 12:46.963
No problem.

12:49.668 --> 12:50.692
All right. Hit it.

12:58.744 --> 13:00.507
Cover the front, pal.

13:26.005 --> 13:28.235
Point me
to the largest office, KITT.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.775
It's the suite on your left.
Thank you.

14:09.615 --> 14:12.015
KITT, get a picture of all
these. Right away, Michael.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.290
You've been spotted, Michael.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.853
I suggest a hasty retreat.

14:40.779 --> 14:41.973
Get him!

15:02.101 --> 15:04.865
KITT, the back entrance.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.294
Judging from
these photographs...

15:36.368 --> 15:38.563
I'd say Tanika
is after Coy O'Brien.

15:38.671 --> 15:42.198
Coy? What's he got to do with all
this? That's a good question, RC.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.607
Look, we got to put him in a safe place
till we deal with Tanika and find out.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.806
I'll arrange for him to stay
here. Safest place for him.

15:48.881 --> 15:52.749
I still don't understand why Tanika has
shots of Coy all the way back to infancy.

15:52.818 --> 15:55.446
See if you can ID the man
holding the baby.

15:56.288 --> 16:00.384
Look, RC, hang around Tanika's office
and tail him if he leaves. Then call in.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.552
Yeah.
I'm going to check on Coy.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.659
I wanna tell you guys...

16:11.737 --> 16:14.262
how much I appreciate
what you did the other day.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.508
But you can't keep on
taking risks like that.

16:17.576 --> 16:21.239
There may be more violence, and you'll
be putting your lives on the line.

16:21.780 --> 16:25.978
Anybody wants out
or just wants some time off...

16:26.285 --> 16:27.616
I'll understand.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.015
We already talked this over,
Mr. O.

16:30.122 --> 16:33.353
While through good times and bad
times, you've always treated us right.

16:33.425 --> 16:35.052
We figure it's our turn now.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.152
That's right. Yeah.
We're with you all the way.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.163
Right, guys?
Yeah. You betcha.

16:39.231 --> 16:40.630
Me too, Dad.
You can count on me.

16:40.699 --> 16:42.860
No way, kid.
You're going with Michael.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.904
And if word gets back to me that
you've been doing any mouthing off...

16:45.971 --> 16:48.940
I'm gonna kick your butt
all the way down to Pier 26.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.243
Okay, now get out of here,
huh?

17:01.453 --> 17:04.479
Okay, you want to stay, I'll
tell you what's coming down.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.025
You know,
he loves you very much.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.761
You don't have to
tell me that.

17:10.829 --> 17:14.195
My old man would stand in front of
a full-out bulldozer to protect me.

17:14.266 --> 17:17.429
That's why you're staying
with us, so he doesn't have to.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.196
Well, you better make sure this
guy, Tanika, doesn't get me.

17:20.271 --> 17:23.138
I don't want my dad losing
his fight because of me.

17:25.511 --> 17:28.969
You and your dad are two of the
luckiest Irishmen in the world.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.379
Yeah, we do okay.

17:33.752 --> 17:36.585
You gonna let me see
this baby strut its stuff?

17:36.755 --> 17:40.452
Excuse me, Michael. But before
this "baby struts its stuff"...

17:40.692 --> 17:42.284
I'd like to say
the boy's grammar...

17:42.361 --> 17:44.522
is lacking
in lexiphonic luster.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.462
You ready?
Yeah.

17:49.802 --> 17:50.962
Hang on.

18:23.402 --> 18:26.633
The black man on the motorcycle
is still following us.

18:26.905 --> 18:28.702
The same one
who was with Michael Knight?

18:28.774 --> 18:29.832
Yes, master.

18:29.908 --> 18:31.466
Have him brought to me.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.385
Hey, whatever you say.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.516
Check it out.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.108
Whoa!

19:48.253 --> 19:50.744
KITT's bad, but this is bad.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.917
I think he just paid you
a compliment.

19:53.091 --> 19:54.388
Oh, I see.

19:54.793 --> 19:56.283
Thank you, Coy.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.586
I'm afraid you're spending
too much time with RC.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.796
I bet you can plug into
just about anything with this.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.599
Just about. From batting
averages to you name it.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.299
By the way,
have you heard from RC?

20:09.308 --> 20:10.570
Not a word.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.072
I don't know
a Michael Knight...

20:14.279 --> 20:16.941
Nick O'Brien,
or any foundation.

20:17.783 --> 20:21.241
We have many ways
to awaken one's mind...

20:21.853 --> 20:25.311
to what he knows
or doesn't know.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.794
Man, will you just listen?

20:32.998 --> 20:35.694
I don't know any foundation.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.401
Maybe the young man
was telling the truth, Gobi.

20:47.346 --> 20:48.643
Help him up.

20:50.882 --> 20:54.283
Whoever you are, will you
tell this big ape to cool it.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.547
He's got this urge
to break things.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.348
Then tell him why you were
following the limousine.

21:00.025 --> 21:02.493
I wasn't following anything.

21:02.894 --> 21:04.623
A friend of mine called me...

21:04.696 --> 21:08.826
and told me he was house sitting
this old mansion on Holly Canyon Road.

21:09.368 --> 21:13.805
The road you traveled on was Holly
Canyon Drive, not Holly Canyon Road.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.135
Road, drive.

21:16.742 --> 21:19.267
What do I know?
I made a mistake.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.382
Where is the boy, Coy O'Brien?

21:28.153 --> 21:30.849
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:34.159 --> 21:35.456
You will.

21:52.844 --> 21:54.505
Michael, just listen...

21:55.514 --> 21:57.209
I can't talk long.

21:57.382 --> 22:01.944
The old mansion on Holly
Canyon Drive. They're here.

22:02.187 --> 22:04.155
And I'm gonna be
house sitting.

22:04.222 --> 22:07.453
Is that all the Foundation
recorder got from RC's call?

22:07.526 --> 22:08.720
That's it.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.221
I can't figure out why he called
there. He knows we're in the semi.

22:12.297 --> 22:14.697
The voice print matches his.
But it's not his rhythm.

22:14.766 --> 22:17.894
The words have been
reassembled. I don't like this.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.096
I don't like the fact that
he's in there with Tanika.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.504
Michael.
He's got no choice.

22:49.301 --> 22:50.700
Scan the place.

22:51.336 --> 22:53.361
I wanna know what I'll be
up against in there.

22:53.438 --> 22:55.167
Right away, Michael.

22:56.808 --> 22:58.867
I don't detect
any electronic security...

22:58.944 --> 23:01.811
but the main house has guards
posted at every entrance.

23:01.913 --> 23:03.574
Shall we blast
through the gates?

23:03.648 --> 23:06.446
No, no. Tanika knows I'm coming.
I wanna keep a low profile.

23:06.518 --> 23:08.952
The main house
is my obvious move.

23:09.721 --> 23:13.487
Zero in on that structure at the
rear of the grounds and scan it.

23:17.996 --> 23:20.829
I'm picking up RC's
biological profile, Michael.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.161
Terrific.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.292
Open the gates.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.241
All right.
Stand by at the gates, KITT.

24:22.627 --> 24:23.992
Easy, RC. What?

24:37.075 --> 24:38.804
When the time is right...

24:38.944 --> 24:42.675
slowly and painfully we will
take the life from his body.

25:51.483 --> 25:54.418
I'm not surprised you decided to
crawl out of your hole at night.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.420
Rodents prefer the dark,
don't they?

25:56.488 --> 26:00.424
The morning sun may bring a darkness
that would cloud your life forever.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.121
But together, we can
prevent it from happening.

26:04.195 --> 26:06.527
You called the meeting.
I'm here. I'm listening.

26:06.598 --> 26:09.226
I'm not here to talk
about us, Mr. O'Brien...

26:09.367 --> 26:13.736
but about two other men, who, like
us, have a problem that seems...

26:13.805 --> 26:15.272
unresolvable.

26:16.274 --> 26:19.107
Imagine these two men are
pieces in a game of chess...

26:19.177 --> 26:23.614
a knight and a black bishop,
who have just been captured.

26:24.983 --> 26:28.214
Yes,
two very important pieces.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.986
I was certain you agree.

26:30.055 --> 26:33.218
Get to the point before I
shove my fist down your throat.

26:33.892 --> 26:37.055
The player who has captured
them now asks his opponent...

26:38.163 --> 26:40.256
will you gracefully surrender
your king...

26:40.832 --> 26:42.823
or play on
and lose everything?

26:43.168 --> 26:47.366
I'm afraid Mr. Tanika is referring
to Michael and RC, Bonnie.

26:47.572 --> 26:50.040
You can talk in riddles
all you want to...

26:50.108 --> 26:53.703
but I'm not about to surrender my
business to you. Now you got that?

26:53.778 --> 26:56.474
Your business is not
my objective, Mr. O'Brien.

26:57.215 --> 26:58.682
Plainly speaking...

26:58.883 --> 27:01.317
I wish to trade Mr. Knight
and his companion...

27:01.386 --> 27:02.546
for Coy.

27:02.654 --> 27:04.349
For Coy?
What's he got to do with this?

27:04.422 --> 27:05.946
He belongs to his culture.

27:06.024 --> 27:07.082
Bull!

27:07.392 --> 27:09.519
I've had him ever since
he was a baby. He's mine.

27:09.594 --> 27:10.618
No!

27:11.296 --> 27:15.062
Kasuga Sukuritsu
is a national treasure...

27:15.133 --> 27:18.500
a direct descendant of the noble
scholar who gave birth to our cult.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.362
It is Coy's destiny...

27:21.773 --> 27:24.003
to revive the Uyoku
and proclaim...

27:24.075 --> 27:25.838
his divine right
to rule the world.

27:25.910 --> 27:27.138
You are nuts.

27:27.212 --> 27:30.477
You're talking about a 15-year-old
kid who's into baseball.

27:30.949 --> 27:33.679
He means more to me
than anything in the world.

27:34.152 --> 27:37.144
And the last thing that Michael
and RC would want me to do...

27:37.222 --> 27:38.689
is trade Coy for them.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.621
So you're just wasting
your time. Let them go!

27:41.693 --> 27:45.424
Oh, I shall, after
they undergo the ritual...

27:45.697 --> 27:48.689
by which we eliminate
the enemies of the Uyoku.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.268
You hurt one of them,
just one...

27:51.836 --> 27:54.361
and I'll come at you
with everything I've got.

27:54.439 --> 27:58.375
Whatever it takes to bring
you down. Now get off my back!

27:58.443 --> 27:59.535
O'Brien...

28:00.145 --> 28:02.511
you have now made it
a matter of honor.

28:03.748 --> 28:07.775
I have no choice but to destroy
you and take Coy as well.

28:14.025 --> 28:17.688
That leaves Michael and RC in
an extremely dangerous situation.

28:17.996 --> 28:19.691
My dad wouldn't do that.

28:19.964 --> 28:23.161
He said killing them wouldn't
do any good. You heard him.

28:23.234 --> 28:24.758
Tanika will have to
let them go now.

28:24.836 --> 28:26.633
I wish it was that simple,
Coy.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.532
I'm afraid
under the circumstances...

28:29.841 --> 28:32.639
Mr. Tanika can't afford
to take that risk.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.779
Well, what do we do?
Bring in the police?

28:34.846 --> 28:35.870
No.

28:36.081 --> 28:37.878
Tanika would kill Michael
and RC...

28:37.949 --> 28:40.417
the moment he spotted
the SWAT team in the area.

28:41.119 --> 28:42.882
So we sit and wait?

28:43.421 --> 28:45.446
And keep a good watch on Coy.

28:45.757 --> 28:49.352
Tanika will never find him as long
as he's here and we're on the move.

28:49.427 --> 28:53.523
Okay, I'll get us rolling.
Maybe I can talk to him.

28:58.937 --> 29:00.199
Devon, he's gone.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.764
Show me an overall view...

29:03.842 --> 29:05.537
of O'Brien's complex.

29:07.979 --> 29:10.345
The blue line represents the
route of the delivery truck?

29:10.415 --> 29:11.643
Yes, master.

29:11.716 --> 29:14.116
Tomorrow morning, it will make
precisely the same circuit...

29:14.185 --> 29:17.018
through the O'Brien complex
that it makes every weekend.

29:17.122 --> 29:18.111
Good.

29:18.857 --> 29:21.985
Where will the containers
with explosives be delivered?

29:25.630 --> 29:29.464
The demolition plan is multiphased
to ensure maximum destruction.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.066
You will be able to sequentially
detonate the charges...

29:32.137 --> 29:33.627
from a remote position.

29:34.472 --> 29:38.067
The technical staff has attained
new levels of excellence, Kumita.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.337
Inform them
they will be rewarded.

29:44.349 --> 29:46.180
Complete annihilation.

29:46.918 --> 29:51.116
O'Brien will be powerless to
retaliate once we have the boy.

29:52.357 --> 29:53.847
Michael? Where are you?

29:53.925 --> 29:56.257
KITT! KITT!

29:57.395 --> 30:00.125
I know you said to stay put,
but on some occasions...

30:00.198 --> 30:02.826
it's a lot harder
to obey orders than others.

30:03.067 --> 30:05.831
But I'm sure you have good
reason for not answering.

30:51.316 --> 30:54.808
You, who believe in the
divine right of the Uyoku...

30:55.186 --> 30:57.950
and of the boy,
Kasuga Sukuritsu...

30:58.089 --> 31:01.081
shall choose in which manner
these two shall die.

31:01.593 --> 31:04.187
Shall Gobi hunt them
like frightened deers...

31:04.262 --> 31:07.026
or shall he play with them...

31:07.332 --> 31:09.800
as the bear
toys with the rabbit?

31:10.235 --> 31:12.635
Bear! Bear!

31:14.873 --> 31:16.340
So be it.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.674
Is there any chance
of this being a fair fight?

31:20.745 --> 31:23.475
Not unless we're the bear
and they're the rabbit.

31:27.952 --> 31:29.681
Hey! Hey, hold it!

31:35.193 --> 31:36.717
We found him outside.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.763
Let them go, Mr. Tanika.
Don't hurt them.

31:48.773 --> 31:50.434
Come stand beside me.

31:58.316 --> 32:00.284
Okay, I'll stand
next to you...

32:00.351 --> 32:02.751
I'll stand behind you,
I'll do whatever you want...

32:02.820 --> 32:06.119
but you have to let them go
and leave my dad alone.

32:07.926 --> 32:11.521
In time, I will be pleased to
obey the Master's commands...

32:13.131 --> 32:15.190
but I cannot do so now.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.494
Why not,
if he's the Master?

32:18.670 --> 32:22.834
Because the Master must be ordained
Emperor Prince of the Uyoku...

32:23.574 --> 32:26.372
before he can
control our destiny.

32:28.379 --> 32:30.210
You got to be
putting me on.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.343
The only control I want
is on my fastball.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.180
And I wanna live
with my dad.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.847
KITT, I need you.

33:03.915 --> 33:06.509
Open the gates
and get in here real fast.

33:06.584 --> 33:08.074
Right away, Michael.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.866
Something tells me
we're doing this all wrong.

33:27.939 --> 33:30.271
Yeah, that's what my body
keeps telling me.

33:35.313 --> 33:36.780
The boy! Stop him!

33:36.848 --> 33:40.750
Who is this guy, anyway? I don't
know, but I wish he was on our side.

33:40.818 --> 33:41.807
Yeah.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.512
You hit him high, I'll hit
him low? Okay, you go first.

33:45.590 --> 33:48.354
Obviously, you're kidding.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

34:04.442 --> 34:05.875
Where's Coy?

34:09.746 --> 34:11.271
Over there. Let's go!

35:07.138 --> 35:08.901
Look, Coy,
I'm proud of the way...

35:08.973 --> 35:10.201
you stood up against Tanika.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.071
You might be as tough
as your old man...

35:12.143 --> 35:15.579
but as long as you're my
responsibility, you got to stay put.

35:15.646 --> 35:17.546
Got you, Michael, but...
No buts.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.708
Coy, I'm sure
you're very hungry.

35:20.518 --> 35:24.113
Now, why don't you find Bonnie and
get her to fetch you some breakfast?

35:28.793 --> 35:33.127
The police found Tanika's
enclave empty, stripped bare.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.228
What about his offices?

35:36.434 --> 35:38.402
I'm afraid the gentleman
has disappeared.

35:39.303 --> 35:43.171
Makes me feel real uncomfortable not
knowing where this cat might turn up.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.436
Devon, Tanika is a fanatic.

35:45.543 --> 35:48.444
If he thinks he's lost, he's gonna
try and take others down with him.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.674
You're talking
about Nick O'Brien.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.178
O'Brien here.

35:57.255 --> 35:58.449
Nick? Devon.

35:58.856 --> 36:00.084
Have you seen Tanika?

36:00.158 --> 36:01.625
No sign of him here, Devon.

36:01.692 --> 36:02.750
That's a relief.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.757
Nick, I urge you
to double security.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.593
And keep it that way
until we've located Tanika.

36:07.665 --> 36:08.757
Right.

36:08.833 --> 36:12.496
You know, I almost wish he would show
up. This time my boys will be ready.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.634
If Tanika's gonna move on him,
O'Brien's gonna need more than his boys.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.972
I'll grab my bike
and meet you there.

36:21.112 --> 36:22.704
Gentlemen, be careful.

37:15.366 --> 37:18.597
Michael, Devon's calling.
Yo, Devon. What's up?

37:18.669 --> 37:21.763
Bonnie's succeeded in
accessing Tanika's database.

37:21.839 --> 37:25.366
Take a look at this graphic. I'm
patching it into KITT's system.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.748
KITT, what do those numbers
add up to?

37:34.819 --> 37:37.515
They designate key structural
locations at the plant.

37:37.588 --> 37:39.556
The chemical symbols
represent the components...

37:39.624 --> 37:41.956
of an extremely
destructive plastic explosive.

37:42.026 --> 37:45.189
Devon, we're looking at Tanika's
blueprint for the total annihilation...

37:45.263 --> 37:46.662
of O'Brien Industries.

37:46.731 --> 37:48.631
I'll call Nick immediately.
You got it.

37:48.699 --> 37:50.098
Super pursuit mode, pal.

38:20.564 --> 38:22.361
Where's Denny?
Sick.

38:22.933 --> 38:27.302
But I've got the order sheet, and a
diagram of where the deliveries go.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.133
Hold it a moment.

38:36.013 --> 38:37.344
Gate security, Anderson.

38:37.415 --> 38:39.679
Anderson,
this is Nick O'Brien.

38:39.750 --> 38:43.481
I want every incoming vehicle
gone over with a fine tooth comb.

38:43.554 --> 38:46.546
The weekend parts delivery is just
coming through now, Mr. O'Brien.

38:46.624 --> 38:49.024
No exceptions.
Everything gets the once over.

38:49.093 --> 38:51.254
What are we looking for?
Explosives.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.024
You got it, Mr. O'Brien.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.467
I rounded up
as many men as I could.

38:58.602 --> 39:01.196
Okay. Bring them all in here
for a second. Come on in, guys.

39:07.211 --> 39:10.442
I'm gonna have to check your
load. Orders from Mr. O'Brien.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.672
Let me see your lading bills.

39:37.675 --> 39:40.007
Give me an ETA
to O'Brien Industries.

39:40.077 --> 39:41.601
Three minutes, 15 seconds.

40:06.670 --> 40:08.399
Sign here, please.

40:18.783 --> 40:22.378
We're getting close to O'Brien's.
All right, go back to normal.

40:31.562 --> 40:34.326
Michael, Tanika's data indicates
that the first detonation...

40:34.398 --> 40:36.423
will occur
in the main elevator shaft.

40:53.017 --> 40:54.314
Sign here.

40:54.885 --> 40:57.046
I can't tell you guys
how grateful I am...

40:57.121 --> 40:59.146
you're giving up your weekend
to back me up.

40:59.223 --> 41:00.815
Like we said, Mr. O...

41:00.891 --> 41:03.382
even in bad times, you
stood by us. It's our turn.

41:04.929 --> 41:06.794
Let's see that graphic again.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.329
I'm picking up
heavy concentrations...

41:11.402 --> 41:12.801
of plastic explosive.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.938
Each charge
has a remote detonator.

41:15.005 --> 41:18.463
With Tanika at the controls. See if
you can get a fix on his position.

41:18.542 --> 41:21.238
I can't, not until he uses
the detonating frequency.

41:21.312 --> 41:24.213
You mean we have to wait for something
to blow before we can spot him?

41:24.281 --> 41:26.841
I'm sorry, Michael. Well,
start with the elevator, pal.

41:50.407 --> 41:54.070
Keep your eyes open, your backs
covered, and keep swinging. Let's go.

42:57.975 --> 42:58.964
KITT, what's happening?

42:59.043 --> 43:01.944
Someone has activated the
elevator from a remote location.

43:18.162 --> 43:21.063
Hey, you! What the hell
are you doing up there?

43:23.601 --> 43:25.228
Come on, let's get him!

43:30.040 --> 43:32.167
KITT, I got the bomb.

43:35.813 --> 43:37.371
Can you jam this thing?

43:37.448 --> 43:39.541
I still can't read
the detonating frequency.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.608
You better get it
out of there, Michael.

43:42.453 --> 43:46.389
Okay, bring me down, real
quick. No problem, Michael.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.460
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

43:53.731 --> 43:54.720
Hey!

44:10.414 --> 44:12.006
Behind you.
Take that!

44:40.644 --> 44:44.341
All right. Now that you've got
Tanika's frequency, locate and nullify.

44:44.415 --> 44:47.646
Tanika's frequency is nullified,
Michael, and I've located him.

44:47.718 --> 44:50.016
Good work, pal.
Let's go and get him.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.755
Master, I believe I can...

45:22.086 --> 45:23.178
There he is.

45:44.408 --> 45:46.706
Okay, pal,
let's drown the rat.

46:03.694 --> 46:06.959
Your rising sun just set,
Tanika.

46:27.918 --> 46:30.944
That's a good a way as I know
to show some pride.

46:31.021 --> 46:33.046
You all knew
there'd be risks today.

46:33.123 --> 46:34.556
But you stood by me...

46:34.758 --> 46:36.885
you faced them, and you won.

46:39.630 --> 46:43.964
Of course, a little help from
a special friend never hurts.

46:44.168 --> 46:46.898
Thank you. I was just happy
to be part of a team...

46:46.970 --> 46:49.302
that's sticking up
for what they knew was right.

46:49.373 --> 46:51.864
I guess that's what
Old Glory's all about.

46:55.379 --> 46:57.973
I don't know. "Thank you"
doesn't seem like enough.

46:58.048 --> 47:00.778
Hey, don't worry about it.
You got a terrific son.

47:01.185 --> 47:03.153
Thank you.
Okay.

47:04.121 --> 47:05.486
That's righteous stuff,
Michael.

47:05.556 --> 47:08.116
For once, Coy, I agree
with your choice of slang.

47:08.192 --> 47:10.558
Individual achievement
and team spirit...

47:10.627 --> 47:13.095
are indeed indelibly ingrained
in our ideals.

47:13.163 --> 47:15.825
There he goes again.
What's he talking about now?

47:15.899 --> 47:20.461
Ruth, Gehrig, Mantle,
Mays, guys like that.

47:20.604 --> 47:23.801
He's talking about baseball? Sure,
a great baseball player is a star.

47:23.874 --> 47:26.399
But he's also part of the
team. I agree, Michael.

47:26.476 --> 47:28.637
Baseball
is our national pastime...

47:28.712 --> 47:31.180
but there are other
manifestations of the American way.

47:31.248 --> 47:35.810
That's right. Nothing is more
American than an inside fastball.

47:35.886 --> 47:37.353
You nailed that guy.

47:38.305 --> 47:44.683
