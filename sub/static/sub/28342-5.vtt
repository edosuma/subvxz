WEBVTT

00:00.809 --> 00:02.309
Andrew, how much money
did you steal?

00:02.392 --> 00:04.684
Technically, it was you that
stole the money from the fund,

00:04.767 --> 00:06.601
because I signed your name
on some documents.

00:06.684 --> 00:07.475
Oh my God.

00:08.016 --> 00:10.933
Mayor Splett, how does it feel
to be the hero of 7-Eleven?

00:11.017 --> 00:12.892
Oh, I'm no hero.
I'm just a mayor.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.559
I happen to consult for a number
of very large clients in Asia,

00:16.642 --> 00:19.726
and they were very, very
impressed and delighted

00:19.809 --> 00:21.183
-by your sermon.
-(SELINA MEYER CHUCKLES)

00:21.267 --> 00:22.392
Ma'am, you wanna see this.

00:22.475 --> 00:23.601
REPORTER:
Poll watchers are reporting

00:23.809 --> 00:27.225
that over 48,000 black voters
were turned away.

00:27.309 --> 00:29.933
I think the Chinese
just delivered.

00:30.017 --> 00:31.225
Oh, uh, I need an itinerary.

00:31.309 --> 00:34.559
Itineraries are only for
people who work on the campaign.

00:34.642 --> 00:35.684
Wait, I'm fired?

00:35.767 --> 00:36.809
I believe her words were,

00:36.892 --> 00:38.684
"If I need another
Washington douche,

00:38.767 --> 00:40.601
I'll go to
the M Street Rite-Aid."

00:47.100 --> 00:48.517
The latest
Super Tuesdays polls are in.

00:48.601 --> 00:49.809
- Oh.
- You're up three in Texas.

00:49.892 --> 00:51.517
- Eight in North Carolina.
- Ooh!

00:51.601 --> 00:53.392
- Up two in Massachusetts.
- Nice!

00:53.475 --> 00:54.975
Then we fly back
to Virginia tonight,

00:55.058 --> 00:56.517
pop into Alabama on the way,

00:56.601 --> 00:58.100
and then a quick stop
in Oklahoma City

00:58.183 --> 00:59.559
for an hour-and-a-half rally.

00:59.642 --> 01:02.058
That's an hour and 29 minutes
too long

01:02.142 --> 01:04.058
in that former Indian
concentration camp.

01:04.141 --> 01:06.559
Ben: Looks like Kemi's
got full protection
from the Secret Service.

01:06.642 --> 01:08.933
What kind of affirmative action
bullshit is that?

01:09.017 --> 01:10.851
Here's your speech, ma'am.
I dumbed it down even more.

01:10.933 --> 01:13.058
Good, 'cause the last one
looked like the toilet bowl

01:13.142 --> 01:15.058
after William F. Buckley
ate a thesaurus.

01:15.142 --> 01:17.434
Kemi has been getting
some death threats.

01:17.517 --> 01:21.350
Well, then we should leak
some of my  death threats, OK?
I get some, don't I?

01:21.434 --> 01:23.017
- Kent: Oh, yeah.
- Gary: So many.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.058
Here's a couple that came in
while you were on the plane.

01:25.142 --> 01:27.392
"I'm gonna break your fat arms
and strangle you--"

01:27.475 --> 01:29.225
Wait. I don't have  fat arms.

01:29.309 --> 01:31.892
That's just criminally insane--
and regular insane.

01:31.975 --> 01:33.767
- Pick another one.
A plausible one.
- Gary: Yeah.

01:33.851 --> 01:36.434
Leon:
"Someone should put a bullet
in your shriveled old face."

01:36.517 --> 01:37.975
No!

01:38.058 --> 01:40.642
Just make up some death threats
that are nicer.

01:40.726 --> 01:41.933
OK, I'll come up
with a dozen.

01:42.017 --> 01:43.684
Wait a minute.
Before I go onstage,

01:43.767 --> 01:44.975
where are we now?

01:46.183 --> 01:49.975
- I wanna say the South?
- Uh-- Well...

01:50.058 --> 01:51.933
- Gary, go find out
where we are.
- Gary: Yeah.

01:52.017 --> 01:53.851
( music playing )

01:55.767 --> 01:58.392
Leon:
Ma'am, there is
a small change to the speech.

01:58.475 --> 02:00.517
We no longer use
the Rosa story.

02:00.601 --> 02:02.933
- What are you talking about?!
It kills every time. Tears!
- I know.

02:03.017 --> 02:04.975
Rosa was deported
this morning.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.183
- Selina: Hi!
- They identified her
from details in your speech.

02:07.267 --> 02:09.309
Well, that's impossible,
because I made her up.

02:09.392 --> 02:12.517
Well, no, actually, ma'am,
there's a Rosa Sanchez
in Tennessee

02:12.601 --> 02:15.392
who has four kids
and the exact same
dead-end jobs.

02:15.475 --> 02:18.933
- Oh, my God, you conjured her!
- Yeah, right out of
my Stephen Glass-hole.

02:19.017 --> 02:21.225
- Oklahoma City!
- Reporters: Madam President!

02:21.309 --> 02:23.350
Any comment that
a federal grand jury in New York

02:23.434 --> 02:25.350
is getting ready
to indict your husband,
Andrew Meyer?

02:25.434 --> 02:27.350
- He's my ex-husband.
- Can you respond to a rumor

02:27.434 --> 02:30.183
that he's hired a new legal team
and is making a deal
with prosecutors?

02:30.267 --> 02:33.434
I can't hear you, so you're
gonna have to repeat that.

02:33.517 --> 02:35.809
- You have to repeat it.
- That can only mean
one thing, ma'am.

02:35.892 --> 02:37.309
Andrew's gonna
flip on you.

02:37.392 --> 02:38.851
Goddamnit!

02:38.933 --> 02:42.017
Tell my attorney to meet me in
the next filler state we're in.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.142
'Cause last I heard,
you can't run for office

02:44.225 --> 02:46.058
- and  be in prison.
- Ben: Maybe in the House
you can.

02:46.142 --> 02:48.475
Ben:
Ma'am, this Andrew thing
is everywhere.

02:48.559 --> 02:51.601
Your unfavorables are rising
past "accidental ethnic slur"

02:51.684 --> 02:53.975
- right into
"men's room incident."
- Oh, God.

02:54.058 --> 02:55.809
- Selina: Catherine? OK.
- Marjorie: Oh. Shh.

02:55.892 --> 02:57.809
This is the face
of clinical depression, ma'am.

02:57.892 --> 02:59.392
With the hair
of a mental patient.

02:59.475 --> 03:01.017
Oh, my kingdom
for a beret.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.434
Listen, honey,

03:02.517 --> 03:04.350
um, Daddy is in hiding again

03:04.434 --> 03:06.684
and I know he calls you
to borrow money sometimes--

03:06.767 --> 03:08.851
Fight your own battles,
Mother, OK?

03:08.933 --> 03:10.475
I'm really struggling
right now.

03:10.559 --> 03:11.892
Selina:
OK, you know what,

03:11.975 --> 03:13.933
if anyone should
be depressed, it's me,

03:14.017 --> 03:16.434
but I am stable
as fuck.  ( laughs )

03:16.517 --> 03:17.517
Yeah, you are!

03:17.601 --> 03:18.601
Your lawyer's waiting.

03:18.684 --> 03:20.100
Karen!

03:20.183 --> 03:22.684
- Madam President!
- Oh, I'm glad to see you.

03:22.767 --> 03:26.267
- You too.
- Andrew might be
cutting a deal,

03:26.350 --> 03:28.142
which would just destroy me.

03:28.225 --> 03:29.809
I have to stop you there,
ma'am.

03:29.892 --> 03:32.809
Andrew has hired me
as his new attorney.

03:32.892 --> 03:34.183
Oh-- Thank God.

03:34.267 --> 03:36.392
So you can talk him
out of this deal, right?

03:36.475 --> 03:38.851
But it's a very good deal.
For him.

03:38.933 --> 03:40.517
- Karen...
- ( laughs )

03:40.601 --> 03:42.684
you understand that...

03:42.767 --> 03:45.684
when I am elected
president again,

03:45.767 --> 03:49.434
I can issue Andrew
a full pardon.

03:49.517 --> 03:51.892
- Right?
- I wish you hadn't
told me that.

03:51.975 --> 03:53.559
And yet I'm also glad
that you did.

03:53.642 --> 03:55.892
I might be able
to use it against you.

03:55.975 --> 03:59.559
I wouldn't...
unless I have to.

03:59.642 --> 04:01.892
Well, this has been a dry fuck
on a sandy beach.

04:01.975 --> 04:04.142
It's always a pleasure
to see you as well.

04:04.225 --> 04:05.975
Sure. OK, well, listen,

04:06.058 --> 04:08.975
will you tell Andrew
that I'm gonna be in New York
on Friday?

04:09.058 --> 04:12.017
So he can just
come and talk to me
directly.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.892
I can't advise my client
to do that, but I might.

04:14.975 --> 04:16.183
Ohh... God.

04:16.267 --> 04:18.058
Any luck with
the human Mobius strip?

04:18.142 --> 04:19.726
Andrew's cutting a deal.

04:19.809 --> 04:21.058
I could go to jail.

04:21.142 --> 04:22.434
I don't look good
in jumpsuits.

04:22.517 --> 04:23.975
I mean, I do, but I don't.
Ya know.

04:24.058 --> 04:25.475
- ( knock on door )
- What?

04:25.559 --> 04:27.475
Ma'am,
we've got incoming.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.434
I've got a buddy at WaPo
who's working on a story
about South Carolina

04:30.517 --> 04:32.892
and possible foreign
election interference.

04:32.975 --> 04:34.475
OK, first of all,

04:34.559 --> 04:37.392
call it the Washington Post
like a non-asshole,

04:37.475 --> 04:39.809
and I don't know anything
about foreign interference,

04:39.892 --> 04:41.767
and stop staring at me
like I'm some sort of

04:41.851 --> 04:43.726
teenage runaway that
you just strangled.

04:43.809 --> 04:45.267
Yes, ma'am.

04:45.350 --> 04:47.767
Oh, my God.
First Andrew,

04:47.851 --> 04:50.601
and now this Washington Post
Chinese thing?

04:50.684 --> 04:51.933
I mean, my God,

04:52.017 --> 04:54.183
this is like having
two different Senators

04:54.267 --> 04:56.058
with their hands up my skirt.

04:56.142 --> 04:57.601
Which actually
happened to me once

04:57.684 --> 04:59.434
during a Supreme Court
confirmation.

04:59.517 --> 05:03.058
Without going into any legally
incriminating detail, ma'am,

05:03.142 --> 05:04.350
how deep are you?

05:04.434 --> 05:07.517
Keith Quinn is working
with the Chinese.

05:07.601 --> 05:10.309
- Wait, so Quinn
is the in-house Chinese asset?
- Yeah.

05:10.392 --> 05:12.058
- I thought it was Kent.
- I assumed it was you.

05:12.142 --> 05:14.058
What's our play
moving forward here?

05:14.142 --> 05:15.975
The Joseph Goebbels playbook.

05:16.058 --> 05:18.767
Accuse the other side of that
which you are guilty.

05:18.851 --> 05:20.309
Steal from the best.

05:20.392 --> 05:22.225
You need to get rid
of that Chinese money, ma'am.

05:22.309 --> 05:23.809
Gary?

05:23.892 --> 05:27.017
Just book me on
the friendliest
news show possible.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.475
Copy that. Mike it is.

05:28.559 --> 05:31.809
OK, Gary, you need to spend
every dime in the space-based--

05:31.892 --> 05:34.183
- Faith-based.
- Mm-hmm. On religious shit.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.559
- ASAP.
- I don't know
how to do that.

05:36.642 --> 05:38.309
I don't even know
how it got there.

05:38.392 --> 05:41.975
Just give it to one of those
gay-converting Baptist colleges

05:42.058 --> 05:44.975
to fund a statue
of a gold-plated Jesus

05:45.058 --> 05:47.183
- fucking a triceratops.
- Wow.

05:47.267 --> 05:49.142
Amy:
All right,
Congressman Slender Man.

05:49.225 --> 05:50.726
Don't say his name.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.684
Now that Florida has moved
its primary to Super Tuesday,

05:52.767 --> 05:54.684
we are going to stay here
and focus all of our efforts.

05:54.767 --> 05:57.017
No, I told Beth
that we could
go to Arkansas

05:57.100 --> 05:59.975
- so she could give me
a hand job in a hot spring.
- It's my birthday.

06:00.058 --> 06:03.975
Your particular brand
of crazy is polling very
high here in Florida,

06:04.058 --> 06:06.767
especially with
melanoma-loving
swamp fuckers,

06:06.851 --> 06:08.434
storm-ravaged
climate deniers,

06:08.517 --> 06:10.851
and deadbeat dads...
and deadbeat moms.

06:10.933 --> 06:12.017
Those are my peeps.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.851
So we are launching

06:13.933 --> 06:15.726
a brand-new
fundraising initiative:

06:15.809 --> 06:18.225
Next month, donate $38

06:18.309 --> 06:22.017
for Jonah Ryan's
38th birthday.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.933
Thirty-eight dollars?
That's like a shitty gift

06:24.017 --> 06:25.642
that you get from
your asshole grandmother.

06:25.726 --> 06:27.309
If Selina Meyer did this,

06:27.392 --> 06:28.851
she'd get, like,
a thousand dollars

06:28.933 --> 06:30.267
because she's, like,
a thousand years old.

06:30.350 --> 06:31.684
Selina would kill
to be 38.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.809
She's been lying
about her age for years.

06:33.892 --> 06:35.726
- Whatever. I'd still do her.
- I'm down to clown.

06:35.809 --> 06:37.726
Holy shit, Bruckheimer,
when you get an abortion,

06:37.809 --> 06:39.851
you're supposed to leave
the mangled fetus at the clinic,

06:39.933 --> 06:42.309
not staple it to the skeleton
of a gay condor

06:42.392 --> 06:43.475
and run it for president.

06:43.559 --> 06:45.392
- Well, hello, darlin'.
- Hi.

06:45.475 --> 06:46.767
What Saudi prince's
rape dungeon

06:46.851 --> 06:48.434
did you finger-trowel
your way out of?

06:48.517 --> 06:53.517
- Uh... Jonah's rape dungeon?
- Oh ho! In your face!

06:53.601 --> 06:57.017
All right, anyway, I have
the pleasure of informing you,
Congressman Slender Man--

06:57.100 --> 06:58.726
- Mm-mm.
- Amy: Nope, beat you to it.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.183
Oh, shit. All right.

07:00.267 --> 07:01.767
Our government
has assigned you

07:01.851 --> 07:04.017
your very own
Secret Service detail.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.058
- Whoa, what?
- Special Agent Youngblood!

07:06.142 --> 07:08.517
Youngblood?
Oh, that's my favorite
Rob Lowe movie.

07:08.601 --> 07:10.309
Congressman Ryan,
it's an honor.

07:10.392 --> 07:12.225
Oh, yeah! This is like
looking in a mirror.

07:12.309 --> 07:14.975
- Yeah, a hot  mirror.
- I'll be right outside, sir.

07:15.058 --> 07:17.100
Chances are you're still
likely to get assassinated,

07:17.183 --> 07:18.809
but the killer,
may God guide his hand,

07:18.892 --> 07:20.517
will just have to work
a little harder.

07:20.601 --> 07:22.183
Hey, can I get some
of that body armor?

07:22.267 --> 07:24.434
Sincerest congratulations
on all your life choices, Amy.

07:24.517 --> 07:26.933
- Thank you. It pays quite well.
- Have a good weepy slide

07:27.017 --> 07:29.601
down the shower wall
this evening. We gotta go.

07:29.684 --> 07:31.642
Will's got a full day
ahead of him. Tell 'em
what you gotta do, Will.

07:31.726 --> 07:34.517
I was hoping
to finally finish
my passion project.

07:34.601 --> 07:37.767
- Which is?
- Rerouting my urethra
to behind my balls

07:37.851 --> 07:40.100
so that I have to sit to pee
like a real girl.

07:40.183 --> 07:42.017
- ( cackling )
- Goodbye, Amy, Jonah.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.684
- Jonah: Bye, Will.
- Very nice to meet you,
Mrs. Ryan.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.017
Reporter:
Mayor Splett,

07:45.100 --> 07:46.601
do you consider
yourself a hero?

07:46.684 --> 07:49.225
- ( overlapping chatter )
- Sit your hawk asses down!

07:49.309 --> 07:50.809
Not you, Richard.

07:50.892 --> 07:53.517
I'm gonna pick one of you
minimum wage media monkeys

07:53.601 --> 07:56.267
to ask three pre-approved
questions, pre-written by me,

07:56.350 --> 07:57.809
and she's gonna owe me
for the rest of her life.

07:57.892 --> 08:00.975
And yes, I said "she,"
and I don't mean you.

08:01.058 --> 08:03.142
Well, I'd say I got here
not a moment too soon.

08:03.225 --> 08:06.142
- Because President Meyer
fired you?
- All right, look, Richard,

08:06.225 --> 08:08.309
we have an incredible
opportunity here.

08:08.392 --> 08:10.434
I mean, the entire country
thinks that you're a hero.

08:10.517 --> 08:12.142
Except for
the 7-Eleven truthers.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.892
They say that no Jewish people
were working in the store
that day,

08:14.975 --> 08:16.975
but there's no Jewish people
in Lurlene, so...

08:17.058 --> 08:19.058
Richard, you need
a chief of staff

08:19.142 --> 08:20.767
that has real D.C. experience.

08:20.851 --> 08:22.392
Mister Mayor,
the lieutenant governor

08:22.475 --> 08:25.142
still wants to set up a time
for your award ceremony.

08:25.225 --> 08:27.975
Oh, Willa, this is Dan Egan,
my new Chief of Staff.

08:28.058 --> 08:31.183
- Sure.
- Ah, Dan, there's no
easy way to say this,

08:31.267 --> 08:33.726
but, uh, given your reputation,

08:33.808 --> 08:36.350
there's no dipping your quill
in the company ink.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.517
- Copy that.
- I mean sex.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.017
- Got it.
- By that, I mean Willa.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.475
Mike:
I wouldn't be doing my job,

08:41.558 --> 08:42.558
Madam President,

08:42.642 --> 08:43.808
if I didn't ask the question

08:43.892 --> 08:44.933
that's on everybody's mind:

08:45.017 --> 08:46.559
Is that a new hairstyle?

08:46.642 --> 08:48.767
And your ex-husband Andrew
is about to be indicted

08:48.851 --> 08:50.684
in the Southern District
of New York.

08:50.767 --> 08:53.017
Which is not a question,
actually.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.975
Well, what we really
should be talking about

08:55.058 --> 08:56.767
is Senator Talbot's husband

08:56.851 --> 08:59.225
and the longstanding
accusations against him.

08:59.309 --> 09:01.058
- Oh. Well, let's go
with that one.
- Gary: Mm-hmm.

09:01.142 --> 09:03.475
- That sounds juicy.
- Plus his tax evasion.

09:03.559 --> 09:05.975
Wait, Senator Talbot's husband
is cheating on his taxes?

09:06.058 --> 09:07.392
Well, that's what
people are saying.

09:07.475 --> 09:08.767
How is nobody
looking into this?

09:08.851 --> 09:10.309
I mean, Why isn't
the press covering this?

09:10.392 --> 09:11.809
Are they biased against you?

09:11.892 --> 09:14.183
Well, you said it, not me,
but I also say it.

09:14.267 --> 09:17.434
You know, it's getting
so you can't believe
anything the media says

09:17.517 --> 09:19.434
- about anyone's husband!
- Mike: Yeah!

09:19.517 --> 09:21.559
It's really a treat for me
to come on a show

09:21.642 --> 09:23.601
that's fair and impartial.

09:23.684 --> 09:26.183
- ( chuckles )
When does this air?
- Well, it's streaming now.

09:26.267 --> 09:28.559
Oh, I see. And what time
will that be?

09:28.642 --> 09:30.559
Now, you're going
to lead off with a nod

09:30.642 --> 09:32.309
to the anti-vaccination
movement.

09:32.392 --> 09:33.809
Yeah, why go to the doctor
and get a shot

09:33.892 --> 09:35.225
for something
you don't even have?

09:35.309 --> 09:36.726
Yeah, I didn't get
Clay vaccinated

09:36.809 --> 09:38.225
because it causes autism,

09:38.309 --> 09:39.601
and now he just has
a little  bit of autism.

09:39.684 --> 09:41.309
Yeah, and when
I was a kid,

09:41.392 --> 09:43.933
they said
the best case scenario
was I had autism.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.392
- Fuckin' look at me now.
- Don't use that line up there.

09:46.475 --> 09:48.767
Don't yell at him, 'cause
loud noises make him flip out.

09:48.851 --> 09:50.809
- Rick, there's a gun
in the front row.
- What? Jonah?

09:50.892 --> 09:53.684
- Ha ha ha ha! Made you look!
- P.A.: Ladies and gentlemen...

09:53.767 --> 09:55.517
- You're on!
- Wish me luck, meat shield.

09:55.601 --> 09:58.559
- ...Jonah Ryan!
- How you doin', Clearwater!

09:58.642 --> 10:02.559
Right. If I could digress
from my prepared remarks...

10:02.642 --> 10:03.767
How would anyone know?

10:03.851 --> 10:05.183
...I want to talk
about my opponent,

10:05.267 --> 10:07.100
( mocking tone )
President Selina Meyer.

10:07.183 --> 10:09.475
- ( all booing )
- Has anybody noticed

10:09.559 --> 10:11.434
that she's been, like,
55 years old forever?

10:11.517 --> 10:12.767
Yeah, I mean, come on,

10:12.851 --> 10:14.975
she is totally lying
about her age, right?

10:15.058 --> 10:16.058
Man:
Kill her!

10:16.142 --> 10:17.767
Yeah, I mean, sure, maybe.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.601
I mean, how old are you
really, Selina Meyer, huh?

10:20.684 --> 10:22.809
- Crowd: Yeah!
- When are you from?

10:22.892 --> 10:25.933
When! Are! You! From?!

10:26.017 --> 10:30.017
When are you from?
When are you from?

10:30.100 --> 10:31.892
When are you from?

10:31.975 --> 10:33.767
When are you from?

10:33.851 --> 10:35.434
They have an actual crowd there?

10:35.517 --> 10:39.183
What, are they giving away
free Tommy Bahama dick cozies?

10:39.267 --> 10:41.142
Ma'am, this is not
a big deal.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.975
Just show 'em
your birth certificate.

10:43.058 --> 10:44.309
While we're at it,
why don't we show 'em

10:44.392 --> 10:46.142
my estrogen patch
prescription

10:46.225 --> 10:48.642
and a Polaroid of
my stretch marks?

10:48.726 --> 10:50.017
You mean your wisdom stripes.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.809
I have always been
open and transparent

10:52.892 --> 10:54.058
about how old I am.

10:54.142 --> 10:56.434
- Yeah, 55.
- I believe it's 53.

10:56.517 --> 10:58.350
- Late 40s.
- You're all correct.

10:58.434 --> 10:59.975
Well, look who
cleans up nice.

11:00.058 --> 11:01.225
Can I get a quick fiver,
Madam P?

11:01.309 --> 11:03.309
Yeah. Oh, Gary,
that reminds me,

11:03.392 --> 11:05.309
I need to switch out
my estrogen patch.

11:05.392 --> 11:07.809
Mm. Should I slip in a little
swirl of progesterone for you?

11:07.892 --> 11:10.058
- You can surprise me.
- Yep. Ohh...

11:10.142 --> 11:12.017
- Ma'am, uh, you...
- Yeah.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.975
It's fine. They know everything.

11:15.058 --> 11:17.225
Me so complicit.
Me go jail long time.

11:17.309 --> 11:20.309
All right!
The Houston Chronicle
is reporting that Kemi voters

11:20.392 --> 11:23.017
have somehow got the idea
that if they vote
in the primaries,

11:23.100 --> 11:25.726
they're gonna get
an IRS audit.

11:25.809 --> 11:27.684
( laughing )

11:27.767 --> 11:29.142
( Selina chuckles )

11:29.225 --> 11:31.559
Keith, I don't want to know
how you did that.

11:31.642 --> 11:33.809
Well, Facebook'll
walk you through it
step by step.

11:33.892 --> 11:36.726
You know what? Maybe it's best
if you don't update us so much.

11:36.809 --> 11:39.017
- But there is just one
other matter.
- Selina: OK.

11:39.100 --> 11:42.183
Dissident poet Deng Dao
has been arrested for--

11:42.267 --> 11:44.851
well, they'll figure it out
after they shoot him.

11:44.933 --> 11:46.017
What does that have
to do with me?

11:46.100 --> 11:47.809
As the woman
who freed Tibet,

11:47.892 --> 11:50.434
I'm guessing they'll want you
to support them publicly.

11:50.517 --> 11:54.058
OK, Keith, as much
as I hate  poetry,

11:54.142 --> 11:56.100
I'm not gonna do that.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.350
Yeah, until this
Washington Post thing
blows over,

11:58.434 --> 12:01.475
we're gonna keep our wangs
out of your Chinese
fuckin' finger trap.

12:01.559 --> 12:02.684
( laughs )
Yeah, right.

12:02.767 --> 12:04.100
All right, I'll tell them.

12:04.183 --> 12:06.225
They insist on hearing
bad news right away.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.434
Fine.

12:07.517 --> 12:09.267
Oh, uh, and if you
talk to your ex,

12:09.350 --> 12:11.975
you might want to ask him
about his  business with China.

12:13.726 --> 12:15.767
- What?
- See what he says.

12:18.309 --> 12:20.601
Is Andrew tied in
with the Chinese?

12:20.684 --> 12:22.350
I-I don't know. I mean,

12:22.434 --> 12:24.559
he's always had a thing
for Asians.

12:24.642 --> 12:27.892
So do I, but if Andrew starts
talking to the grand jury about,

12:27.975 --> 12:29.434
you know, you and China--

12:29.517 --> 12:32.767
This was supposed to be
just a little simple bit

12:32.851 --> 12:35.267
of election-rigging!

12:35.350 --> 12:37.475
- Fuck!
- ( door opens, closes )

12:37.559 --> 12:39.809
( low ) I have
your estrogen patch,
if you'd like.

12:39.892 --> 12:43.267
You wear it. Maybe you'll grow
some hair on your vagina!

12:43.350 --> 12:44.309
Hmm.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.100
Man:
...March Wheelwright
Medal of Bravery.

12:48.183 --> 12:49.434
Mayor Richard Splett
of Lurlene

12:49.517 --> 12:51.434
demonstrated remarkable
heroism...

12:51.517 --> 12:53.142
Look at that.
I'm telling you, Richard,

12:53.225 --> 12:55.100
this is just the beginning,
all right?

12:55.183 --> 12:57.434
Oh-- Sidney Purcell.

12:57.517 --> 12:59.601
Of all the mid-priced
steakhouse chains

12:59.684 --> 13:00.933
in northeastern Iowa...

13:01.017 --> 13:02.809
Oh, sorry. Mayor Splett,
this is Sidney Purcell.

13:02.892 --> 13:04.517
He represents
the very good people

13:04.601 --> 13:06.434
At Con-Ag-Chem Family Farms.

13:06.517 --> 13:08.142
Ah, well, this man
needs no introduction.

13:08.225 --> 13:09.933
Please, the 7-Eleven mayor
himself.

13:10.017 --> 13:12.475
- Would you care to join us?
- Yeah, I don't mind if I do.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.726
That's a great idea.
I'm actually

13:14.809 --> 13:16.767
really glad that
I happened to run into you.

13:16.851 --> 13:19.267
There is a vote coming up
in the state Senate

13:19.350 --> 13:22.767
- regarding
pesticide regulations.
- That's right.

13:22.851 --> 13:25.058
And there's an empty seat
up there.

13:25.142 --> 13:26.475
Do you know anything
about pesticides?

13:26.559 --> 13:27.684
Not as much as I'd like.

13:27.767 --> 13:29.267
That empty seat
in the state Senate,

13:29.350 --> 13:30.475
it could be yours.

13:30.559 --> 13:31.933
You know, down
at the feed store

13:32.017 --> 13:33.726
they're saying
your new seeds
cause cancer.

13:33.809 --> 13:35.142
Well, we've paid
for seven studies

13:35.225 --> 13:36.475
that say that it doesn't.

13:36.559 --> 13:38.642
- Seven? Wow.
- Yeah, seven. Lucky sevens.

13:38.726 --> 13:40.975
That's good enough for me.
Can't argue with science.

13:41.058 --> 13:43.517
I'm gonna get some drinks.
You guys stay here, talk,
get to know each other.

13:43.601 --> 13:45.309
You know what I want,
right, Dan?
What do you want, Mayor?

13:45.392 --> 13:46.767
I want to read
those reports.

13:48.933 --> 13:51.642
I'm sorry, um, you look
so familiar to me.

13:51.726 --> 13:54.183
- Mmm.
- Did, uh, did we...?

13:54.267 --> 13:57.809
( laughing ) Oh, no!
I'm an OB-GYN.

13:57.892 --> 14:00.475
You brought a woman
into my clinic

14:00.559 --> 14:02.559
to have her pregnancy
terminated.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.142
Could you be a little
more specific?

14:04.225 --> 14:05.975
I'm actually worried
she might have

14:06.058 --> 14:07.642
some sort of thyroid issue
because of her eyes.

14:07.726 --> 14:09.892
- Oh! Amy.
- Yeah, Amy.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.017
Reminds me, I gotta
Apple Pay her for my half.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.517
Hey, can I
buy ya a drink?

14:13.601 --> 14:15.225
You can buy me half  a drink.

14:15.309 --> 14:16.183
Oh.

14:16.267 --> 14:17.767
( Selina laughing )

14:17.851 --> 14:19.933
Kemi ( on TV ):
This is insane!

14:20.017 --> 14:22.225
My husband has never done
an illegal thing in his life--

14:22.309 --> 14:23.809
in his entire life!

14:23.892 --> 14:25.183
( reporters clamoring )

14:25.267 --> 14:27.267
( laughing )

14:27.350 --> 14:31.225
When women fall apart,
they really fuckin' fall apart!

14:31.309 --> 14:33.183
( laughing )

14:33.267 --> 14:35.100
Did you take the coconut
out of my muesli

14:35.183 --> 14:36.517
- for tomorrow morning?
- No. No.

14:36.601 --> 14:37.851
And you know
what you need to do?

14:37.933 --> 14:39.225
You need to use
tweezers this time

14:39.309 --> 14:41.767
because I really thought
I could taste your fingers.

14:41.851 --> 14:43.142
I'm sorry.

14:43.225 --> 14:45.809
These, by the way,
are completely hideous.

14:45.892 --> 14:47.309
- Catherine ordered those.
- Oh.

14:47.392 --> 14:50.100
- Ohh. That's too much.
- It is.

14:50.183 --> 14:52.058
- But thank you.
- What?

14:52.142 --> 14:54.809
- Good evening, Lee.
Got your message.
- OK, yeah.

14:56.517 --> 14:59.475
Wow, I've been trying to
track you down for days.

14:59.559 --> 15:02.225
Hearing you say that
really  takes me back.

15:02.309 --> 15:03.434
Ha!

15:03.517 --> 15:04.767
OK. Out.

15:04.851 --> 15:08.058
Excuse me.
I  have work to do.

15:08.142 --> 15:11.100
Are you really trying to cut
a fucking deal here?

15:11.183 --> 15:12.809
- Well...
- I mean, my God,

15:12.892 --> 15:15.350
do you understand this could
cost me the presidency, Andrew?

15:15.434 --> 15:17.058
- I had no choice.
- Oh, that's what you said

15:17.142 --> 15:19.017
about Catherine's
freshman year roommate.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.726
She had done a gap year abroad.
She was not a true freshman.

15:21.809 --> 15:23.058
And now...

15:23.142 --> 15:25.559
I'm hearing about you
and the Chinese?

15:25.642 --> 15:28.559
That's funny, you're
the third person who's asked me
about that this week--

15:28.642 --> 15:31.058
a U.S. attorney, a reporter
from the Washington Post--

15:31.142 --> 15:32.601
Since when are you doing
business with them?

15:32.684 --> 15:34.726
Actually, you.
Your name is all over--

15:34.809 --> 15:37.100
I should have really married
that gay guy my mother liked.

15:37.183 --> 15:40.726
A couple years ago,
a few Beijing businessmen
approached me,

15:40.809 --> 15:42.975
and they wanted
the investment expertise

15:43.058 --> 15:45.350
of the former president's
disbarred ex-husband.

15:45.434 --> 15:46.933
No big deal.

15:47.017 --> 15:48.975
And we cleaned
a teeny-tiny bit of money

15:49.058 --> 15:51.225
through the Meyer Fund--
low nine figures.

15:51.309 --> 15:54.434
- And that faith-based thing
was a godsend.
- OK. I--

15:54.517 --> 15:56.225
Wait a minute.
You know Keith Quinn?

15:56.309 --> 15:58.767
I know him as Luther.
We met in Macao
at the shark fights.

15:58.851 --> 16:00.434
Do you want me
to take the raisins out--

16:00.517 --> 16:02.309
- Out!
- Yep. Mmm.

16:02.392 --> 16:03.559
Yes!

16:04.601 --> 16:07.933
If we could find
a fall guy...

16:08.017 --> 16:09.892
Gary?

16:09.975 --> 16:12.767
Honestly, I don't think
people are gonna buy

16:12.851 --> 16:16.601
that a guy who calls vaginas
"crinkum-crankums"

16:16.684 --> 16:20.434
is gonna be able
to pull off some sort of
multimillion-dollar fraud.

16:20.517 --> 16:22.309
- Come on.
- Well, it, uh...

16:22.392 --> 16:26.058
it would absolutely
destroy Catherine, but, um...

16:27.642 --> 16:29.309
Marjorie?

16:29.392 --> 16:31.183
That's kinda perfect.

16:31.267 --> 16:33.142
Besides:
women's prison.

16:33.225 --> 16:34.809
Yeah. Wall-to-wall
crinkum-crankum.

16:34.892 --> 16:36.851
- Jonah: I'm not touching you.
- Amy: Oh, OK.

16:36.933 --> 16:38.851
- I'm not touching you.
- Amy: Thank you for
looking into that.

16:38.933 --> 16:41.642
Jonah, we still need a copy
of your birth certificate

16:41.726 --> 16:45.142
and the New Hampshire
Vital Records office
cannot find it, so...

16:45.225 --> 16:47.809
Oh, yeah. No, that makes sense,
I was born in Toronto.

16:47.892 --> 16:49.975
Toronto... Canada?

16:50.058 --> 16:52.851
I don't know, just cancel
the press conference.

16:52.933 --> 16:54.142
Absolutely not!

16:54.225 --> 16:56.642
Do you have any idea how crazy

16:56.726 --> 17:00.017
all of this talk
about Selina's age
must be making her?

17:00.100 --> 17:02.350
We are turning the screws

17:02.434 --> 17:06.601
on that miserable,
poultry-necked hag...

17:06.684 --> 17:08.392
- ( squeals )
- Jesus, Amy.

17:08.474 --> 17:10.974
God, is that what
a real orgasm feels like?

17:11.058 --> 17:12.349
Ugh. Do women have those?

17:12.434 --> 17:13.933
That's what
I've been telling you.

17:14.017 --> 17:16.058
All right, fine.
I'll call my mom.

17:16.142 --> 17:18.601
- Thank you.
- Oh, and I should probably
call Rick's mom too

17:18.684 --> 17:20.892
just because she's
probably still pretty sore
from last night

17:20.974 --> 17:23.684
when I was all up in that...
♪ Puss-ay-ay-yay ♪

17:23.767 --> 17:25.392
♪ In that puss-ay-ay-yay ♪

17:25.474 --> 17:27.601
♪ In that puss-ay ♪

17:27.684 --> 17:29.058
What are you gonna
do about it?

17:29.142 --> 17:30.601
- Ohh! Ow!
- ( thud )

17:30.684 --> 17:32.100
Selina:
Marjorie? Love to talk to you

17:32.183 --> 17:34.017
for a second
about the Meyer Fund.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.601
There's something
I'd like to speak with
you about as well.

17:35.684 --> 17:37.183
- Oh, OK. Good.
- It's about Catherine.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.142
I think you know
I'm a very traditional woman,

17:39.225 --> 17:41.142
though I do seek
to topple the patriarchy

17:41.225 --> 17:43.642
by queering
hetero-normative tropes.

17:43.726 --> 17:45.809
Are you talking
about your outfit?

17:45.892 --> 17:48.225
As I was saying, I love
your daughter very much.

17:48.309 --> 17:52.267
I know that you do,
Marjorie, um, Palmiotti,

17:52.350 --> 17:55.975
and I have to say that
I love the work that you do
on the Meyer Fund very much.

17:56.058 --> 18:01.058
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Although I personally don't
know anything about it

18:01.142 --> 18:04.809
because you're the complete
mastermind behind it, right?

18:06.975 --> 18:10.183
I think I can see you
nodding your head "yes"...

18:10.267 --> 18:12.517
Are you recording this
conversation, ma'am?

18:12.601 --> 18:14.601
That is a bizarre thing to say.

18:14.684 --> 18:16.642
Well, the flowers
have been moved,

18:16.726 --> 18:18.933
- and... Andrew's phone.
- Um--

18:19.017 --> 18:20.559
I refuse to allow you
to implicate me

18:20.642 --> 18:22.183
in your financial
misdeeds, ma'am.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.350
They're not misdeeds.

18:23.434 --> 18:25.100
They were
exploited opportunities.

18:25.183 --> 18:27.267
- Oh, there's my phone.
- Yeah, she found it.

18:27.350 --> 18:29.267
I'll spare Catherine
this shameful episode.

18:29.350 --> 18:30.975
Despite the fact that you are

18:31.058 --> 18:33.183
two of the most reprehensible
people I have ever met...

18:33.267 --> 18:34.892
- Hang on a second.
- Where did that
come from? Seriously.

18:34.975 --> 18:38.183
...by some magical combination
of abuse and neglect

18:38.267 --> 18:40.309
managed to create
the perfect daughter.

18:40.392 --> 18:42.392
- Thank you very much.
- And that's why...

18:42.475 --> 18:44.975
I would like to ask
both of you for Catherine's
hand in marriage.

18:45.058 --> 18:46.642
- Oh!
- Whoa!

18:46.726 --> 18:48.601
- Wow.
- You-- You have our blessing.

18:48.684 --> 18:51.142
- Yes, you have our blessing.
Absolutely.
- Thank you.

18:51.225 --> 18:53.475
- Thank you very much.
- Can I ask you
a question, Marjorie?

18:53.559 --> 18:55.601
- Of course, ma'am.
- Why would you buy that cow?

18:55.684 --> 18:58.017
Oh. When I can get the milk
for free. Very good, ma'am.

18:58.100 --> 19:01.017
- What?
- I'm leaving now.
For the record.

19:01.100 --> 19:02.434
It's-- I'm not--

19:02.517 --> 19:03.809
Ohh, God.

19:06.559 --> 19:08.726
- Lee?
- Mm?

19:08.809 --> 19:11.434
I honestly never thought
it would come to this,

19:11.517 --> 19:13.267
but I have had
a suitcase packed

19:13.350 --> 19:15.851
and ready to go by the door
for the last 20 years.

19:15.933 --> 19:17.767
- What?
- I still have Mee-Maw's boat.

19:17.851 --> 19:19.142
- The Labor Day?
- Mm-hmm.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.642
You told me it sank.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.559
I told you
I reported it sunk
to insurance.

19:23.642 --> 19:25.642
And I could take it
down to Cuba,
and from there,

19:25.726 --> 19:28.975
you know I've long felt
a deep connection
with the land of Israel

19:29.058 --> 19:31.434
and their
non-extradition treaty.

19:31.517 --> 19:34.392
You can't just disappear,
and I can't have people
thinking I'm Jewish.

19:34.475 --> 19:36.058
We're right in the middle
of the primaries.

19:36.142 --> 19:37.726
It's the best thing
for both  of us.

19:37.809 --> 19:39.642
The only thing
they have on you is me.

19:39.726 --> 19:43.309
Well, that's
the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

19:43.392 --> 19:45.183
But I'm gonna need some
walkin'-around money.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.975
Here we go. What-- I mean,
how far do you have to walk?

19:49.058 --> 19:50.726
Fuck!

19:50.809 --> 19:52.434
I mean, can you
give me 24 hours?

19:52.517 --> 19:53.434
Yeah. Yes.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.058
( sighs )

19:57.267 --> 19:58.642
I guess this is goodbye.

19:58.726 --> 20:00.267
I guess so.

20:01.475 --> 20:03.017
Well...

20:03.100 --> 20:04.267
good-bye.

20:08.350 --> 20:10.392
Hey, Andrew. What are you doing?

20:10.475 --> 20:12.809
- Oh, yeah, I should
probably go out the back door.
- Yeah.

20:12.892 --> 20:15.183
Your false accusations
are working, ma'am.

20:15.267 --> 20:17.350
Oh. Then they're
no longer false.

20:17.434 --> 20:20.517
Basically a two-woman race
to see who is less offensive
to the American people.

20:20.601 --> 20:22.851
That's the best explanation
of democracy I've ever heard.

20:22.933 --> 20:25.225
Also, they found Rosa Sanchez
in El Salvador.

20:25.309 --> 20:27.767
- Who?
- The fake real woman
from your speech?

20:27.851 --> 20:31.100
Just in the nick of time.
She was about to be stoned
by the local child army.

20:31.183 --> 20:33.684
OK, guys, um...
last night...

20:33.767 --> 20:37.017
I don't like when
people feel they have to
get closer to talk to me.

20:37.100 --> 20:40.183
It usually means
I'm gonna be facing
a longer prison sentence.

20:40.267 --> 20:43.142
- I saw Andrew...
- The prosecution rests.

20:43.225 --> 20:46.559
We talked about
a trip he might  take
out of the country...

20:46.642 --> 20:48.851
I will add tampering
to our list of charges.

20:48.933 --> 20:52.058
But if we were able
to give him a going-away gift,

20:52.142 --> 20:56.475
uh, he might be able
to turn it into a stay-cation.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.559
- And bribery.
- Gary?

20:58.642 --> 20:59.892
Yes, here.

20:59.975 --> 21:02.975
How much is left in
that whole faith-space--

21:03.058 --> 21:04.183
Kent:
Faith-based.

21:04.267 --> 21:07.434
I spent it all on Bibles
for the homeless.

21:09.225 --> 21:12.267
You spent millions...

21:12.350 --> 21:13.559
Yes, yes, I did.

21:13.642 --> 21:16.183
...on leather-bound
hobo toilet paper.

21:16.267 --> 21:19.267
Mmm. I hope they don't use
the New Testament for that.

21:19.350 --> 21:20.892
I need to speak
with Keith Quinn.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.892
- Did I do something wrong?
- Go.

21:22.975 --> 21:24.392
Ma'am,
not Keith Quinn.

21:24.475 --> 21:26.017
Yes. What, do you
have a better idea?

21:26.100 --> 21:27.726
- Yes, not Keith Quinn.
- No. Go.

21:27.809 --> 21:29.851
- Ma'am, it's time.
- Oh, OK. It's--

21:31.892 --> 21:32.892
( clears throat )

21:32.975 --> 21:34.684
I was an alcoholic,

21:34.767 --> 21:37.267
I was in a relationship
with a blonde, uncaring

21:37.350 --> 21:38.975
bug-eyed rage-aholic.

21:39.058 --> 21:40.851
I used to work with someone
just like that.

21:40.933 --> 21:43.809
Oh, my gosh, folks,
our best friend of the show,

21:43.892 --> 21:45.809
President Selina Meyer,
is on the line calling us today.

21:45.892 --> 21:47.767
Selina:
Hello, Mike?
How are you?

21:47.851 --> 21:49.559
Mike:
Great. Hope you got the invite
for the baby shower.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.100
What's going on with this chair?
It's too low.

21:51.183 --> 21:52.684
Hint: We could still use
the changing table,

21:52.767 --> 21:53.975
or bye-bye ping pong.

21:54.058 --> 21:55.601
Oh, that's actually a cute name.

21:55.684 --> 21:56.559
Are you gonna keep that?

21:56.642 --> 21:57.975
- Morning!
- Shh!

21:58.058 --> 22:00.183
I'm calling because
I wanted to talk to you

22:00.267 --> 22:02.100
about Senator Talbot's husband.

22:02.183 --> 22:04.851
I have been hearing from
hardworking American people

22:04.933 --> 22:06.767
from all walks of life

22:06.851 --> 22:10.183
that what he's into
is way  beyond tax fraud.

22:10.267 --> 22:13.684
( whispering )
I need some help for me ex
from your friends in the East.

22:13.767 --> 22:17.142
Oh, I thought we were putting
our little arrangement
on the back burner?

22:17.225 --> 22:20.100
Madam President, Senator Talbot
has just released a statement.

22:20.183 --> 22:21.475
I'm gonna read it
so I get it right.

22:21.559 --> 22:23.267
You are simply
attacking her family

22:23.350 --> 22:24.933
to distract
from your own problems,

22:25.017 --> 22:27.017
- and that you are the one...
- Guess what?

22:27.100 --> 22:29.142
Mike, I  have
a special announcement.

22:29.225 --> 22:32.601
My daughter Catherine
is getting married

22:32.684 --> 22:34.434
to her lady friend Marjorie.

22:34.517 --> 22:36.309
That's amazing!
Isn't that great, buddy?

22:36.392 --> 22:38.058
Well, the Bible is actually
very clear--

22:38.142 --> 22:39.851
Selina:
But now I have to run.

22:39.933 --> 22:41.475
It's been such fun
talking with you,

22:41.559 --> 22:43.933
and I'm sure
we'll connect later.

22:44.017 --> 22:46.392
So... Andrew?

22:46.475 --> 22:47.726
- I'll take care of it.
- OK.

22:47.809 --> 22:49.684
- Any date for the wedding?
- Huh?

22:49.767 --> 22:51.642
- Any date for the wedding?
- Oh, who gives a shit.

22:51.726 --> 22:53.684
Richard:
This has been
a very difficult decision,

22:53.767 --> 22:56.017
but, no, I will not be running
for state Senate.

22:56.100 --> 22:59.183
There's just so many things
I still want to do for the
good people here in Lurlene,

22:59.267 --> 23:02.434
like my own pet issue,
which, as many of you know,
is pet issues.

23:02.517 --> 23:05.684
And I certainly hope
I'm not letting anyone down,
especially my new friend Sidney.

23:05.767 --> 23:07.392
Are you referring
to Sidney Purcell,

23:07.475 --> 23:09.350
the Con-Ag-Chem
Fam Farm lobbyist?

23:09.434 --> 23:11.183
I'm so sorry.
We don't have any time
for more questions.

23:11.267 --> 23:12.851
Actually, Dan,
that did sound like a question.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.392
Yes, Sidney Purcell,
super generous guy,

23:15.475 --> 23:17.058
offered me all sorts
of great stuff,

23:17.142 --> 23:18.559
like brand-new
kitchen appliances

23:18.642 --> 23:21.142
or a brand-new hot tub like
the lieutenant governor has.

23:21.225 --> 23:23.601
- We have a schedule to keep--
- But I'm not supposed to
talk about that, right, Dan?

23:23.684 --> 23:25.183
Mayor Splett, are you saying

23:25.267 --> 23:27.642
that Con-Ag-Chem made you
an offer to run for office?

23:27.726 --> 23:29.559
No, that's not what he said.
He didn't say that.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.517
- No, no, no, Dan is right.
- Dan: Thank you.

23:31.601 --> 23:34.559
Sidney made the offer.
Con-Ag-Chem is a company,
it can't talk.

23:34.642 --> 23:37.726
- Hilarious. A talking company.
Where would the mouth even be?
- Dan: We gotta go.

23:37.809 --> 23:40.559
Ben:
Ma'am, the press is out there
waiting for you.

23:40.642 --> 23:43.475
Rosa is gonna spend
the night here in Boston.
No mini-bar key.

23:43.559 --> 23:46.434
This sit-down's gonna
give us a nice little boost
for the Latino vote.

23:46.517 --> 23:48.142
- All right.
- Kent: Hold up.

23:48.225 --> 23:50.267
Ma'am, I'm sorry, there's
no easy way to tell you this.

23:50.350 --> 23:52.809
- Oh.
- Your mother's boat,
the Labor Day,

23:52.892 --> 23:55.392
exploded off the coast
of Florida this afternoon.

23:55.475 --> 23:57.559
Andrew was the only
person aboard.

23:59.642 --> 24:02.392
No, uh-uh. 'Cause
he was going to Cuba.

24:04.350 --> 24:06.642
A...lledgedly.

24:06.726 --> 24:10.183
Ma'am, maybe we can just, uh,
cancel this-- this Rosa thing.

24:10.267 --> 24:11.434
No!

24:11.517 --> 24:13.350
The Latino vote, Ben.

24:16.309 --> 24:17.267
I'm so sorry.

24:17.350 --> 24:19.350
He was my ex-husband.

24:22.892 --> 24:23.975
( indistinct chatter )

24:26.017 --> 24:28.642
( soft chuckle ) Hello.

24:28.726 --> 24:30.350
Oh, wow. Rosa.

24:30.434 --> 24:32.933
Oh, my good friend.

24:33.017 --> 24:34.601
That's not Rosa.

24:34.684 --> 24:36.892
N-- Oh? Oh! ( laughs )

24:36.975 --> 24:38.559
There she is. ( laughs )

24:38.642 --> 24:41.601
- That must be your mother.
- My sister.

24:41.684 --> 24:42.933
Your si-- sister. OK.

24:43.017 --> 24:44.809
Selina:
Familia.  Rosa...

24:44.892 --> 24:46.975
you have had
quite a journey.

24:47.058 --> 24:49.267
They put me on a plane
and sent me to Mexico.

24:49.350 --> 24:51.142
That's a terrible... place.

24:51.225 --> 24:52.309
I did nothing wrong.

24:52.392 --> 24:54.225
No, well, I  did nothing wrong.

24:54.309 --> 24:57.475
I'm-- I'm just trying to
run for president here.

24:57.559 --> 25:00.475
You don't know how lucky
you have it, really,
to tell you the truth.

25:00.559 --> 25:03.267
I mean, the next thing ya know,
everything can change,

25:03.350 --> 25:06.183
it just goes...
( imitates explosion )
like that, right?

25:06.267 --> 25:07.933
- Rosa: Mm.
- And-- And then--

25:08.017 --> 25:09.892
OK, I think we need
to wrap this up here.

25:09.975 --> 25:11.142
- Oh.
- We got a busy schedule.

25:11.225 --> 25:12.892
I just want
to say thank you,

25:12.975 --> 25:14.851
- President Montez.
- Sure, why not.

25:14.933 --> 25:17.100
- Rosa: God bless you.
- Madam President,
quick question--

25:17.183 --> 25:20.517
- ( indistinct chatter)
- Selina: I want to be alone.

25:20.601 --> 25:22.058
( breathing heavily )

25:26.892 --> 25:32.142
Mom, I can't believe that you
ruined Marjorie's proposal
all over the internet.

25:32.225 --> 25:36.350
Catherine, I have just gotten
some terrible news
about your father,

25:36.434 --> 25:38.392
uh, being lost at sea,

25:38.475 --> 25:39.892
and you are up my ass

25:39.975 --> 25:42.684
about some proposal bullshit?

25:42.767 --> 25:44.517
- For real?
- Too late, Catherine.

25:44.601 --> 25:46.809
Too late.

25:46.892 --> 25:48.559
- ( knocking )
- Keith: Hey, now,

25:48.642 --> 25:50.892
you're not
a grilled chicken Caesar
and a Miller Lite.

25:50.975 --> 25:54.601
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure. I'm all ears, milady.

25:54.684 --> 25:57.309
- Was it you?
- Excuse me?

25:57.392 --> 25:59.517
Andrew is blown up.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.100
Did you do that?
Did you fucking do that?!

26:02.183 --> 26:03.434
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

26:05.350 --> 26:07.726
I have no idea what you're
talking about, Madame President,

26:07.809 --> 26:10.392
but you did say
to take care of it.

26:10.475 --> 26:13.392
No, I didn't.
I said for you
to pay him off.

26:13.475 --> 26:16.726
I distinctly remember
you saying
"Take care of it."

26:16.809 --> 26:18.851
OK, sure, but I didn't--
I didn't say it

26:18.933 --> 26:21.017
in a "take care of it"
kind of way.

26:21.100 --> 26:22.726
I just said
take care of it.

26:22.809 --> 26:26.267
And it was pretty clear.
You said, "Take care of it,"

26:26.350 --> 26:28.601
and then you gave me a look.

26:28.684 --> 26:32.642
Not a "blow him to
kingdom-fucking-come" look!

26:32.726 --> 26:35.392
No, no, no.
Listen, your eyebrows
did not move at all.

26:35.475 --> 26:38.100
Because
I have had Botox!

26:38.183 --> 26:40.726
I abhor violence
of any type.

26:40.809 --> 26:42.559
- Ye-- Yes.
- OK? But I have seen

26:42.642 --> 26:44.601
plenty of "blow him up" looks.

26:44.684 --> 26:46.183
Oh, I'm sorry. ( crying )

26:46.267 --> 26:48.392
- OK.
- ( weeping )

26:48.475 --> 26:51.684
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

26:51.767 --> 26:53.017
Let me get you some... tissues.

26:53.100 --> 26:54.892
- ( crying ) OK.
- OK? Yeah.

26:54.975 --> 26:56.517
( sobbing )

27:01.933 --> 27:04.100
( gasps )

27:04.183 --> 27:06.225
I'm going back to my room.

27:06.309 --> 27:07.559
Keith:
Oh, OK, OK.

27:07.642 --> 27:09.267
( crying )

27:09.350 --> 27:12.267
It's OK, Catherine.
Catherine, Mommy's here.

27:12.350 --> 27:14.975
- ( sobbing )
- Mommy's here.

27:15.058 --> 27:16.684
OK, Mommy has to go.

27:16.767 --> 27:18.225
- Mommy has to go.
- What?

27:21.809 --> 27:24.559
It's all right, Catherine,
Mommy's here.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.058
What do you think it says?

27:26.142 --> 27:27.392
I don't read Mandarin,
ma'am.

27:27.475 --> 27:28.975
When do the new Kents
come out?

27:29.058 --> 27:30.434
Do we have any friends at State?

27:30.517 --> 27:32.642
We have to find someone
who can read Mandarin

27:32.726 --> 27:33.975
but have no idea
what it means.

27:34.058 --> 27:35.517
Like a brain-damaged Chinaman.

27:35.601 --> 27:37.601
- Or woman.
- Or woman. Sorry.

27:37.684 --> 27:41.017
Or the adopted child of
someone with brain damage.

27:42.851 --> 27:45.809
Amy:
You know what would help sell
this birth certificate presser

27:45.892 --> 27:48.225
is actually finding
the fucking birth certificate!

27:48.309 --> 27:49.809
Yeah, I know! God, Mom!

27:49.892 --> 27:52.267
Don't you have a file
marked "Important Shit"

27:52.350 --> 27:53.851
that has baby teeth in it

27:53.933 --> 27:57.183
and my VHS copy
of "Night Eyes II"
starring Shannon Tweed?

27:57.267 --> 27:59.183
Yes, and that's
the first place I looked.

28:00.684 --> 28:02.475
- What's that?
- There it is!

28:02.559 --> 28:03.851
OK, Jonie,
we really need to talk.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.392
Mom, we don't have time
to talk.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.017
America is waiting
for my leadership.

28:07.100 --> 28:09.434
Oh, excuse me, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

28:12.017 --> 28:13.726
Uh-oh, I think I know
what that's  about.

28:13.809 --> 28:15.684
( indistinct chatter )

28:15.767 --> 28:17.475
Agent Youngblood.

28:17.559 --> 28:19.559
You know, I think you're
doin' a great job, sir.

28:22.267 --> 28:24.475
I have repeatedly called

28:24.559 --> 28:26.975
for Selina Meyer to release
her birth certificate,

28:27.058 --> 28:30.017
but as everybody
on my elementary school
playground knows,

28:30.100 --> 28:32.350
I am not afraid
to show you mine.

28:32.434 --> 28:34.142
In fact, here it is.

28:34.225 --> 28:36.851
This is my birth certificate.

28:36.933 --> 28:40.058
Name: Jonah Joy Ryan.

28:40.142 --> 28:43.017
Weight: six pounds.
Length: twenty-six inches.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.809
Yeah, that's right,
twenty-six inches.

28:44.892 --> 28:47.183
Mother: Nancy Kincannon.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.809
Father...

28:50.933 --> 28:52.142
Excuse me.

28:53.142 --> 28:54.100
( crowd murmuring )

28:54.183 --> 28:55.309
Beth: Jonah.

28:57.851 --> 29:00.100
Now it's your turn,
Selina Meyer.

29:02.851 --> 29:04.017
Lloyd is my real dad?

29:05.392 --> 29:07.058
Oh, of course he is.

29:07.142 --> 29:10.142
I tried to tell you
a hundred times, Jonie.

29:11.309 --> 29:12.350
Do you want a snack?

29:12.434 --> 29:14.100
No. I'm not
talking to y--

29:15.100 --> 29:17.309
Fine. Mac and cheese.

29:17.392 --> 29:19.392
- Nancy: OK.
- I can't believe this.

29:19.475 --> 29:20.726
And ketchup.

29:20.809 --> 29:22.559
That's why we went
to Canada.

29:22.642 --> 29:26.517
We didn't tell anyone because
Lloyd and I are second cousins.

29:26.601 --> 29:29.392
- Beth: Ohh.
- God, Mom,
that is vomitrocious.

29:29.475 --> 29:31.601
I could have been born
with something wrong with me.

29:31.684 --> 29:33.726
You know what? I never thought
that this would be a problem,

29:33.809 --> 29:35.642
then the two of you eloped...

29:35.726 --> 29:39.392
so I just decided
not to think about it...

29:39.475 --> 29:41.642
'cause that's
the best solution sometimes.

29:41.726 --> 29:44.392
- Wait, is Lloyd still my  dad?
- Yeah, nobody knows.

29:44.475 --> 29:47.767
- But you're now
officially my stepsister.
- Half  sister.

29:47.851 --> 29:50.142
I'm sorry, I think
I'm gonna be sick again.

29:50.225 --> 29:51.726
( microwave beeps )

29:51.809 --> 29:53.183
Mac and cheese is ready.

29:53.267 --> 29:54.434
Do you have
any apple slices?

29:54.517 --> 29:56.017
Anything you want,
honey.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.975
I want Lloyd to not be my dad!

30:00.058 --> 30:01.058
Me too.

30:01.142 --> 30:02.809
Mike:
Ma'am, you said

30:02.892 --> 30:04.475
- you weren't gonna be here.
- Surprise!

30:04.559 --> 30:07.058
Do you want
to meet baby Henry?
He's so  cute.

30:07.142 --> 30:10.225
Yes, but often, when a child
gets a new baby brother,

30:10.309 --> 30:13.517
they can feel neglected and--
and low self-esteem.

30:13.601 --> 30:16.100
- Catherine, for one.
- Well, yes, exactly.

30:16.183 --> 30:17.809
And she didn't even have
a baby brother. So--

30:17.892 --> 30:20.434
I actually feel the same way,
too, as a dad, sometimes.

30:20.517 --> 30:23.517
So I think
I should probably go
and see Ellen right now.

30:23.601 --> 30:25.684
Sure. Does anybody want
to meet baby Henry?

30:25.767 --> 30:26.642
No.

30:26.726 --> 30:28.058
Selina:
Hi, Ellen.

30:28.142 --> 30:30.767
I'm your Auntie Selina,

30:30.851 --> 30:32.309
and this is Uncle Bennie,

30:32.392 --> 30:34.975
- and this is...
- Chief Strategist Kent Davison.

30:35.058 --> 30:36.058
- How do you do?
- Hi.

30:36.142 --> 30:37.642
Honey, can you do me a favor?

30:37.726 --> 30:39.892
You know what,
I've got this piece of paper.

30:39.975 --> 30:41.892
( playful tone )
I don't know what it says.

30:41.975 --> 30:43.809
I think maybe
it's in Mandarin.

30:43.892 --> 30:46.100
- Did you bring me a present?
- It's in the car.

30:46.183 --> 30:48.851
Cool. Let's see...

30:48.933 --> 30:51.475
I just talked to my guy
in the Southern District.

30:51.559 --> 30:54.559
They're dropping
the investigation
into the Meyer Fund.

30:54.642 --> 30:55.767
- No!
- Without Andrew,

30:55.851 --> 30:57.517
the whole thing
just blew up.

30:57.601 --> 30:58.767
( chuckles ) Sorry.

30:58.851 --> 31:00.225
Well, what are ya gonna do?

31:00.309 --> 31:01.601
Also, the Post is spiking

31:01.684 --> 31:03.142
its election interference
story.

31:03.225 --> 31:05.601
- ( all laughing )
- Oh, my God! What?!

31:05.684 --> 31:07.892
Is this what it feels like
to be a man?

31:07.975 --> 31:11.100
- Who is Mon-tiz-uh?
- What? Mon-tiz-uh?

31:11.183 --> 31:12.517
- Montez.
- Wait a minute.

31:12.601 --> 31:14.851
Let me--
Let me see what you wrote.

31:14.933 --> 31:16.851
"By giving Meyer the nomination,

31:16.933 --> 31:20.017
they can ensure
a Montez presidency"?

31:20.100 --> 31:21.684
I want to be president
when I grow up.

31:21.767 --> 31:23.642
- You cannot.
- Selina: Goddamnit!

31:23.726 --> 31:26.309
We can't even commit
treason right?!

31:26.392 --> 31:29.392
- What about my present?
- Uh, I'm giving it
to your brother.

31:29.475 --> 31:32.517
More than a dozen
Iowa government officials
are in hot water.

31:32.601 --> 31:35.058
The lieutenant governor,
along with several
state senators,

31:35.142 --> 31:39.809
have all been arrested
for accepting improper
campaign contributions

31:39.892 --> 31:41.684
from Con-Ag-Chem Family Farms.

31:41.767 --> 31:43.225
Bye-bye, Sidney.

31:43.309 --> 31:44.892
Dan, I'm glad
you're here.

31:44.975 --> 31:46.517
Uh, the governor called.

31:46.601 --> 31:48.726
He wants me to resign as mayor,
effective immediately.

31:48.809 --> 31:50.350
What? You didn't
do anything wrong!

31:50.434 --> 31:51.892
That's what he said.

31:51.975 --> 31:53.892
He's appointing me the new
lieutenant governor.

31:53.975 --> 31:56.559
( claps ) Yes. Richard,
that is what I'm talkin' about.

31:56.642 --> 31:58.267
You see? Stick with me, right?

31:58.350 --> 32:00.601
Oh. Now that we're moving
to Des Moines,

32:00.684 --> 32:03.892
Willa is fair game and DTF--
diverticulitis flare-up.

32:03.975 --> 32:06.058
So if you go out to eat,
she can only have rice.

32:06.142 --> 32:07.142
Good to know.
Thank you.

32:11.517 --> 32:13.767
SELINA MEYER: I've got way more
foreign policy experience

32:13.851 --> 32:14.809
than that half-wit Kemi.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.684
I think it's pronounced
half-white.

32:17.642 --> 32:19.809
Am I getting my meeting
with President Lu?

32:19.892 --> 32:21.975
Face to face, I can convince
anyone of anything.

32:22.058 --> 32:23.267
-That's not true.
-Incorrect.

32:23.350 --> 32:24.975
-You're both wrong.
-Well you're right.

32:25.684 --> 32:29.183
Hundred-fourteen million wired
from the Seychelles to Malta,

32:29.434 --> 32:31.559
then back to the Seychelles
and then Spain.

32:31.642 --> 32:32.601
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

32:32.975 --> 32:34.517
That is highly classified.

32:35.017 --> 32:38.517
I'm sorry Selina,
you have left me with no choice.

32:39.309 --> 32:40.309
(MUTTERS SOFTLY)

32:41.142 --> 32:42.559
-Ha!
-That was your phone.
