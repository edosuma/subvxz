00:01.030 --> 00:02.759
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars.

00:02.870 --> 00:03.996
We're worried about you.

00:04.100 --> 00:05.260
Why?

00:05.370 --> 00:06.530
Have you been taking
pills to stay awake?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.494
The shadow
in the picture is you?

00:08.600 --> 00:10.238
Why didn't you
tell us before?

00:10.340 --> 00:11.500
There was always a part of me

00:11.610 --> 00:12.577
that wondered
if that was my fault.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.103
MAN: You're just getting out
of a relationship.

00:15.210 --> 00:16.302
I'm completely out,
it's done.

00:16.410 --> 00:19.413
I wish you could have told me
what was really going on,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.010
instead of me
finding out this way.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.781
This is for you.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.711
My job is especially hard
when you realize

00:25.820 --> 00:28.311
that you've turned innocent
people into collateral damage.

00:28.420 --> 00:29.455
EMILY: Alison is
running out of money

00:29.560 --> 00:31.528
and Shaun is the only one
who knows how to reach her.

00:31.630 --> 00:32.722
ARIA: You knew Alison.

00:32.830 --> 00:34.149
EZRA: I was writing
a book about her.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.319
That's what I was to you?
I was research?

00:36.430 --> 00:38.261
I swear, I will burn this.

00:38.370 --> 00:40.793
No, I want to know what was
worth destroying everything

00:40.900 --> 00:42.037
we had for.

00:44.810 --> 00:48.200
Did you actually read
any of this book?

00:48.310 --> 00:49.572
A few pages.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.409
Bits and pieces.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.818
Ezra knew who I was
before we met.

00:57.450 --> 00:59.179
He knew
who all of us were.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.722
And he knew Alison too.

01:03.830 --> 01:07.049
So he admitted to being in
a relationship with her?

01:07.160 --> 01:09.492
Yeah, a brief one.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.068
Then he must be
Board Shorts.

01:12.170 --> 01:15.264
Well, Ezra didn't try
to kill Alison.

01:15.370 --> 01:18.259
His whole book is trying to
piece together who did it.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.530
How is he gonna do that

01:19.640 --> 01:21.278
when the police
can't even figure it out?

01:21.380 --> 01:22.506
I don't know.

01:22.610 --> 01:24.248
He has a theory though.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.272
And? What is it?

01:26.380 --> 01:28.769
He thinks that
one of us did it.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.644
You're kidding, right?

01:31.750 --> 01:33.513
Well, now we know
it's a work of fiction.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.508
Which one of us is
he trying to pin it on?

01:35.620 --> 01:36.587
I didn't get that far.

01:36.690 --> 01:37.588
You didn't think to ask?

01:37.690 --> 01:38.725
Why?

01:38.830 --> 01:40.388
We know that
that's not true.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.367
Just because he wrote a book
doesn't mean he's not "A".

01:43.470 --> 01:45.324
You know, he could be using it
as a way to place the blame on

01:45.430 --> 01:47.830
one of us and keep
suspicion off of him.

01:47.940 --> 01:49.168
No, he doesn't need
to do that.

01:49.270 --> 01:50.737
He knows
that Ali's alive.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.398
But he didn't know
that when he started
writing the book.

01:52.510 --> 01:55.673
Guys, listen,
Ezra's not "A".

01:55.780 --> 01:58.340
He's a writer who found
a great opportunity

01:58.450 --> 02:01.669
to make a name for himself
and he used me.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.589
He used us.

02:10.460 --> 02:11.779
So wait, what are we saying,

02:11.890 --> 02:13.448
that all of that stuff
in that room in Ravenswood,

02:13.560 --> 02:16.393
that was just
research for his book?

02:17.670 --> 02:19.365
He's been working on it
for years.

02:22.770 --> 02:25.136
Well, we've seen the
surveillance equipment,

02:25.240 --> 02:27.401
so we know
he's been watching us.

02:27.510 --> 02:30.274
He's probably just hoping
that we'd lead him to Alison,

02:30.380 --> 02:32.416
so he could finally get
his big ending.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.409
If he's been watching us,
then he has to know about "A".

02:35.520 --> 02:37.283
I mean, how could he sit back
all this time

02:37.390 --> 02:39.142
and not do anything
to help you?

02:41.260 --> 02:42.727
It's simple.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.827
He never really loved me.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.564
* Got a secret

02:54.670 --> 02:55.694
* Can you keep it?

02:55.800 --> 02:58.507
* Swear this one you'll save

02:58.610 --> 03:00.805
* Better lock it,
in your pocket *

03:00.910 --> 03:03.640
* Taking this one
to the grave *

03:03.750 --> 03:05.900
* If I show you
then I know you *

03:06.010 --> 03:08.570
* Won't tell what I said

03:08.680 --> 03:10.910
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

03:11.020 --> 03:13.511
* If one of them is dead?

03:35.740 --> 03:37.469
You all right
down there?

03:37.580 --> 03:39.275
I'm a bit jet-lagged.

03:39.380 --> 03:40.449
I just got back
from Europe.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.741
So do you go to Hollis?

03:43.850 --> 03:46.410
Just graduated.

03:46.520 --> 03:47.817
I'm gonna start my
first teaching job.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.286
I love this song.

03:50.390 --> 03:51.721
B-26.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.452
What's your major?

03:58.070 --> 04:00.732
Well, I'm leaning
toward English.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.933
That's what I'm teaching.

04:04.770 --> 04:06.306
And I write, too.

04:06.410 --> 04:10.699
But and so far it's mostly
personal, just for me.

04:10.810 --> 04:13.347
Maybe you'd let me read
something of yours?

04:13.450 --> 04:15.918
Yeah, you'd really
want to?

04:16.020 --> 04:17.442
Yeah.

04:17.550 --> 04:20.314
You're smart.
You've traveled.

04:20.420 --> 04:21.887
You have great taste in music.

04:21.990 --> 04:24.527
I'd like to know
more about you.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.276
Morning, honey.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.743
Hi.

04:50.850 --> 04:52.750
You want some coffee?

04:54.720 --> 04:55.880
Yeah.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.688
Black please.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.867
Somebody going on a trip?

05:06.570 --> 05:09.767
Yeah. Your mother and I spoke
with Dr. Griggs this morning.

05:09.870 --> 05:12.031
And he thinks it would be
best that we get you some help

05:12.140 --> 05:15.007
before the situation
gets worse.

05:15.110 --> 05:16.577
What kind of help?

05:16.680 --> 05:18.739
He recommended a rehab
facility in Philly.

05:18.850 --> 05:19.976
Rehab?

05:20.080 --> 05:21.877
I don't need to go to rehab.

05:21.980 --> 05:24.016
Sweetie, I know that
you called his office

05:24.120 --> 05:26.384
impersonating me to renew
your prescription.

05:26.490 --> 05:28.458
I just needed help getting
through a couple of tests.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.448
We've heard that
before, Spencer.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.620
Look, I admit
that I lost control.

05:33.730 --> 05:35.550
Okay, but it's not
like last time.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.389
I've only been taking the pills
for a few weeks.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.536
And how were you even getting
them without a prescription?

05:39.640 --> 05:42.359
Just different
people at school.

05:42.470 --> 05:43.732
It's not that hard.

05:45.940 --> 05:48.579
Please, I'm still
applying to colleges.

05:48.680 --> 05:51.501
I can't have Radley
and rehab on my record.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.739
All I'm asking is that you
give me one chance

05:54.850 --> 05:56.545
to get off them on my own.

05:57.790 --> 05:58.882
Please.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.654
Okay.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.621
We'll give you the chance.

06:05.730 --> 06:07.755
On the condition that you take
the withdrawal medication

06:07.860 --> 06:08.849
under our supervision.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.496
I promise.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.534
And you come home immediately
after school every day.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.062
I will.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.058
Thank you.

06:16.170 --> 06:18.502
This is it, Spencer.

06:18.610 --> 06:20.430
Next time_ there won't be
a discussmn.

06:21.780 --> 06:22.769
I understand.

06:29.050 --> 06:30.779
Hey, you.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.084
Nice suit.

06:33.190 --> 06:33.952
Do you have a job interview
after school or something?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.550
Not exactly.

06:35.660 --> 06:38.788
Look, I've been meaning
to call you and apologize.

06:38.890 --> 06:41.757
It's just that I feel
bad for

06:41.860 --> 06:44.420
you know, what happened.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.020
I should have never
kissed you that day.

06:46.130 --> 06:47.859
Don't sweat it.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.629
Look, it's not that
I didn't enjoy it.

06:52.740 --> 06:55.903
It's just I wasn't in a place
to start something--

06:56.010 --> 06:57.671
Hanna, it's fine.

06:57.780 --> 06:59.077
Okay, I get it.

06:59.180 --> 07:01.842
I just-- I don't really
have time to talk right now.

07:01.950 --> 07:02.939
Why?
Where are you going?

07:03.050 --> 07:03.982
Court.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.079
Court?

07:05.190 --> 07:06.418
What did you do?

07:06.520 --> 07:08.818
Nothing.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.955
It's my dad.

07:10.060 --> 07:11.550
Remember the thing
with Wilden?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.527
Well, he was blackmailing
my dad for a reason

07:14.630 --> 07:16.996
and now the cops are
coming down on him for it.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.933
This is all my fault.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.928
I made you choose
my family over yours.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.759
You didn't make me
do anything.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.933
It was my decision.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.747
And if I had to do it again,
I'd make the same one.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.046
I got to go.

07:48.830 --> 07:49.819
Hey.

07:52.270 --> 07:53.498
How are you feeling?

07:53.600 --> 07:56.467
Nauseous, achy, tired.

07:56.570 --> 07:58.208
Other than that, fantastic.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.774
Can I do anything?

08:00.880 --> 08:02.973
No, thank you for asking.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.069
Are you sure?

08:04.180 --> 08:05.477
Yeah. Please.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.013
Let's talk about
anything other than me.

08:08.950 --> 08:10.508
Shana called me this morning.

08:10.620 --> 08:11.917
From Georgia?

08:12.020 --> 08:13.715
Did she say why she left?

08:13.820 --> 08:15.879
All she said was
she needed me to drop

08:15.990 --> 08:18.185
Ali's money off to a PO. box
in Wallingford

08:18.290 --> 08:19.894
before 6 RM. today.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.058
Wallingford?

08:21.160 --> 08:22.525
That's over an hour away.

08:22.630 --> 08:24.029
Yeah.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.927
I don't think
that you should go.

08:26.030 --> 08:28.032
Why not?

08:28.140 --> 08:31.029
One minute she's here
and in the next she's not

08:31.140 --> 08:32.232
and then
she's calling out of the blue

08:32.340 --> 08:33.637
for an urgent money drop.

08:33.740 --> 08:36.174
We know Ali needs
the money, Spence.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.645
( door slams )

08:48.590 --> 08:49.682
What's going on?

08:49.790 --> 08:50.825
We thought you were
taking the day off.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.750
Need to speak to
Ezra face-to-face.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.020
Well, wait, Aria.

08:54.130 --> 08:57.065
I don't know where the truth
begins and where the lies end.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.592
We don't think you can get
answers, okay?

08:58.700 --> 08:59.997
And you certainly
deserve them.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.261
But confronting him at school
is not the best idea.

09:07.810 --> 09:08.834
Where is Ezra?

09:10.350 --> 09:11.942
Do you mean Mr. Fitz?

09:12.050 --> 09:13.074
Yeah.
I need to speak with him.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.147
Do you know where he is?

09:14.250 --> 09:16.548
Mr. Fitz took time off
for a family emergency.

09:16.650 --> 09:18.208
Is there something
I can help you with?

09:18.320 --> 09:19.810
Oh, family emergency?

09:19.920 --> 09:21.148
Right.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.293
God, he's a liar
and a coward.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.753
Aria, wait.
I'm fine.

09:28.860 --> 09:29.827
Aria, slow down.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.090
I said I'm fine, Hanna.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.967
Okay, let me take you home.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.649
I come bearing gifts.

09:55.990 --> 09:56.979
Cronuts.

09:57.090 --> 09:58.580
What's that?

09:58.690 --> 09:59.725
Haven't you heard?

10:00.660 --> 10:01.854
It's all the rage,
it's a part croissant,

10:01.960 --> 10:02.995
part doughnut.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.294
It's all trans fat.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.129
That's disgusting.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.596
Can I please come in?

10:21.320 --> 10:23.618
I'm sorry
that I ruined last night.

10:23.720 --> 10:27.156
Last night isn't
what I'm upset about.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.081
It's not something
that I'm proud of, Toby.

10:31.190 --> 10:34.398
How can I help you, if I don't
even know you're in trouble?

10:34.500 --> 10:36.024
I get it, okay.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.688
And I would be feeling
the same way

10:37.800 --> 10:39.734
but you don't have to
worry about me.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.262
I've got it
all under control.

10:42.910 --> 10:43.934
You look like crap.

10:45.310 --> 10:47.073
Yeah, I feel like it, too.

10:50.910 --> 10:54.311
Promise me,
you will call me

10:54.420 --> 10:56.718
if you get the urge
to take pills again.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.287
I'm done with that.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.928
And thank you
for my necklace.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.730
Hey, stranger.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.068
Hey.

11:18.170 --> 11:19.432
I was starting to think
I wasn't going to see you

11:19.540 --> 11:20.734
again until graduation.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.944
I know, right?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.074
We're in high school,

11:24.180 --> 11:25.875
we shouldn't be
this scheduled.

11:25.980 --> 11:27.174
What are you doing
after school?

11:27.280 --> 11:28.417
I don't have
practice today.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.148
I have a few errands
I've to run,

11:31.250 --> 11:33.684
and then I've got to go
and visit Aria.

11:33.790 --> 11:36.679
She's having a family crisis.

11:36.790 --> 11:39.088
Yeah, I heard she flipped out
in Fitz's class today.

11:39.190 --> 11:41.795
Yeah, yeah, she's been under
a lot of stress at home,

11:41.900 --> 11:43.265
but she'll be okay.

11:45.000 --> 11:45.819
So can you slot me in?

11:47.270 --> 11:49.135
Yeah, my parents are
going out tonight,

11:49.240 --> 11:51.037
so why don't I call you

11:51.140 --> 11:52.732
after Aria's
and we make dinner?

11:52.840 --> 11:54.000
Great.

11:56.010 --> 11:57.705
Do you always carry
that much cash around?

11:58.550 --> 12:00.245
Oh, um...

12:00.350 --> 12:02.716
It's a late birthday present
from my grandma.

12:02.820 --> 12:03.980
I need to deposit it.

12:04.090 --> 12:04.988
It's on the list.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.489
What is she, a stripper?

12:06.590 --> 12:08.387
Why give you
that much in cash?

12:08.490 --> 12:10.856
She doesn't trust banks.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.394
Her whole life savings has
been stuck into coffee cans

12:13.500 --> 12:15.991
and cookie jars.
Yeah.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.761
Listen, I have to hand in
my yearbook form

12:17.870 --> 12:18.768
before sixth period.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.292
But I will see you tonight.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.163
Yeah.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.417
Open up, Ezra.

12:43.190 --> 12:44.350
Ezra?

12:54.940 --> 12:56.089
Ezra?

14:39.940 --> 14:41.578
ALISON: ( on tape )
I'm safe for the moment,

14:41.680 --> 14:43.147
thanks to you.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.571
But you can't tell
anyone you helped me.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.045
Promise me you won't.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.078
Okay, I still don't know
who I can trust.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.248
I know this isn't
what she expected to hear

14:57.360 --> 15:00.454
but Mr. Hobbs is
complicit in the crime.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.152
So he gave Wilden
a little money

15:02.260 --> 15:03.625
for throwing business
his way.

15:03.730 --> 15:04.890
He didn't hurt anyone.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.558
It's not
a small thing, Hanna.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.592
Look, he did it a few times
and then tried to stop,

15:08.700 --> 15:09.962
but Wilden
wouldn't let him.

15:10.070 --> 15:11.435
That's his version
of the story.

15:13.510 --> 15:15.307
When a cop wants to make
your life miserable,

15:15.410 --> 15:17.344
there's not much
you can do.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.508
Just ask my mom.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.049
Yeah, I shouldn't be talking
to you about this case.

15:22.150 --> 15:23.219
But you're testifying today.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.241
Right.

15:24.350 --> 15:25.942
Because I'm the one
that connected the money in

15:26.050 --> 15:28.189
Wilden's safe deposit box
to Travis's dad.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.157
I need to get to court.

15:33.130 --> 15:35.496
Okay, I'm not saying
he isn't in the wrong.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.625
But Wilden was
a corrupt cop and a bully.

15:37.730 --> 15:39.061
That has to count
for something.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.068
Don't you agree?

15:41.440 --> 15:44.204
My job is to state the facts,
Hanna, not my opinion.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.365
Today Aria told me
she caught her dad

16:17.470 --> 16:19.358
having an affair
with a student last year.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.540
Alison knew about
the affair, too.

16:39.390 --> 16:43.121
Aria and her friends blinded
Jenna in a prank gone wrong.

16:43.230 --> 16:44.390
Alison was the instigator.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.569
Possible motive
for her murder:

16:45.670 --> 16:47.035
someone seeking revenge.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.131
But who?
A boyfriend?

16:49.240 --> 16:50.332
Toby?

18:40.420 --> 18:42.115
What's that?

18:42.220 --> 18:43.482
A gift.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.283
Guess it's better than
a needle in the arm.

18:47.390 --> 18:48.709
Don't give "A" any ideas.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.424
I'll take these
and throw them away.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.555
No, I better.

18:52.660 --> 18:54.298
I want to _toss it far
from this place.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.167
You still up for
Operation Money Drop later?

19:00.240 --> 19:02.390
I can't let
A" down again.

19:04.270 --> 19:05.669
Hey.
Have you talked to Aria?

19:05.770 --> 19:07.670
I texted her a while ago,
but I haven't heard back.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.202
Why?

19:09.310 --> 19:10.675
I went to her house at lunch
and she is not there

19:10.780 --> 19:12.338
and she's not answering
her cell phone.

19:13.780 --> 19:15.771
I think I have an idea
where she might be.

19:27.630 --> 19:30.155
What the hell
happened in here?
Oh, my God. Aria.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.593
HANNA: Hey, are you okay?

19:37.870 --> 19:41.601
Every secret
I told him about All

19:41.710 --> 19:43.405
and about me
and about you guys,

19:43.510 --> 19:45.671
he wrote it down,
it was all for his book.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.576
Aria, if it were me,
I would've burned this

19:49.680 --> 19:51.682
whole place down.

19:51.790 --> 19:54.315
Come on, we're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

19:57.730 --> 19:58.754
Come on.

20:05.730 --> 20:06.765
Wait, you guys.

20:07.900 --> 20:08.969
This is some of the stuff

20:09.070 --> 20:10.196
from Ezra's apartment in
Ravenswood.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.231
Shouldn't we take it with us?

20:11.340 --> 20:13.331
Spencer, not now.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.873
It's nothing
we haven't seen before.

20:17.010 --> 20:18.477
Can you grab
Aria's bag?

20:19.750 --> 20:21.217
Yeah.

20:37.030 --> 20:38.224
HANNA: Spencer, come on.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.509
Hey.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.769
What are you doing here?

21:29.880 --> 21:31.689
I just came to see
how the sentencing went.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.008
You didn't have to do that.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.849
Look, I told you this
isn't your fault, Hanna.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.689
I know I didn't have to.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.485
I wanted to.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.979
So how'd it go?

21:54.080 --> 21:56.332
Actually, much better than
we hoped.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.600
Really?
Yeah.

21:57.710 --> 22:00.008
That cop Holbrook,
spoke up for my dad.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.839
Said he was a decent guy,

22:01.950 --> 22:03.815
pointed out
that he had no priors.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.410
He even reminded the judge

22:05.520 --> 22:06.942
that Wilden didn't
have the cleanest past.

22:07.050 --> 22:08.358
Wow.

22:08.460 --> 22:09.757
So did they drop the charges?

22:09.860 --> 22:13.557
No, but instead of jail time,
they gave him probation,

22:13.660 --> 22:14.558
community service.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.821
God, that's great.

22:16.930 --> 22:18.795
I'm really happy for you
and your dad.

22:20.870 --> 22:22.064
( cell phone ringing )

22:25.870 --> 22:27.098
Oh, this is him.

22:27.210 --> 22:28.802
We're going to go celebrate.

22:30.580 --> 22:31.899
Can we talk more tomorrow?

22:32.010 --> 22:34.672
Yes, yes, go, celebrate.

22:40.620 --> 22:43.350
Thank you.

22:43.460 --> 22:44.427
For what?

22:44.530 --> 22:45.929
Just thanks.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.392
WOMAN: Pope Private Eye.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.001
Leave a message,
we'll find you.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.230
Depositing the money
in your bank account, huh?

24:35.270 --> 24:36.669
Paige.

24:36.770 --> 24:39.136
What are you doing here?

24:39.240 --> 24:40.207
You followed me?

24:40.310 --> 24:41.470
I know you were lying about

24:41.580 --> 24:43.707
your grandma
and her coffee cans.

24:43.810 --> 24:45.675
What is "A" making you do now?

24:45.780 --> 24:46.940
This has nothing
to do with 'A'

24:47.050 --> 24:49.473
Then who's the money for?

24:49.580 --> 24:51.241
I wish I could tell you,
okay, but I can't.

24:51.350 --> 24:52.840
Can't or won't?

24:55.120 --> 24:56.849
Can we not talk
about this here?

25:01.800 --> 25:03.893
I told you I'm going
through something.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.628
You've been going through
something for weeks now.

25:06.730 --> 25:09.039
There's a lot of money
in that envelope, Emily.

25:09.140 --> 25:10.493
What don't you
want me to know?

25:13.880 --> 25:15.279
What is A.D. Incorporated?

25:15.380 --> 25:16.631
Give it back, Paige.

25:16.740 --> 25:18.048
Not until you answer
my question.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.242
I told you, I can't.

25:19.350 --> 25:21.614
Well, I can't let "A" continue
to control you like this.

25:23.180 --> 25:24.886
If you won't tell me
what A.D. Incorporated is,

25:24.990 --> 25:26.617
maybe the police will.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.109
No, you can't take
that to the police, Paige.

25:29.220 --> 25:30.209
Why not?

25:32.330 --> 25:33.820
Because somebody
needs that money.

25:33.930 --> 25:35.022
VVho?

25:37.730 --> 25:39.698
Last chance, Emily,
I'm serious.

25:45.110 --> 25:46.566
Wait.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.171
The money is for Ali.

25:53.110 --> 25:54.179
She's alive.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.803
Are you feeling any better?

26:20.710 --> 26:22.132
Worse, actually.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.878
The more I think about it,
the stupider I feel.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.241
There had
to have been signs.

26:32.350 --> 26:34.284
How did I miss them?

26:34.390 --> 26:37.951
Aria, no one thought he'd be
capable of doing what he did.

26:44.200 --> 26:45.690
He fooled all of us.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.132
Yeah, but you're not the one
who was sleeping with him.

26:53.340 --> 26:54.739
And if it weren't for me,

26:54.840 --> 26:57.843
he wouldn't know things
about you guys.

26:57.950 --> 27:02.114
Personal things that I trusted
him to keep between us.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.780
Aria, he wasn't just getting
information from you.

27:06.690 --> 27:08.612
Do you think that's how
he found out All was alive?

27:09.420 --> 27:10.751
The Grunwald tape?

27:12.290 --> 27:13.894
Yeah, well,
it makes sense.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.150
I just-- I don't even know

27:16.260 --> 27:17.295
how he would have
gotten the tape

27:17.400 --> 27:18.697
in the first place.

27:22.770 --> 27:24.169
Have you eaten today?

27:24.270 --> 27:25.635
Do you want to get some food?

27:25.740 --> 27:27.162
No.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.104
We can order in.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.147
You can go pick up food,
Hannah.

27:33.250 --> 27:35.411
I'll be fine to be by myself
for 10 minutes.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.919
Are you sure?

27:38.120 --> 27:41.817
Okay, but

27:41.920 --> 27:44.184
no more torching Ezra
until I get back.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.162
I can't believe
you've known all this time.

27:56.270 --> 27:57.806
You never said anything.

27:57.910 --> 28:01.175
I wanted to tell you,
but she begged us not to.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.339
If Alison's not dead,
who's in her grave?

28:03.440 --> 28:05.249
We don't know.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.368
Does her family know
she's alive?

28:08.480 --> 28:11.119
The only people
that know are the four of us,

28:11.220 --> 28:13.381
Shana and "A".

28:13.490 --> 28:17.358
Emily, if "A" knows
that Ali's alive

28:17.460 --> 28:19.280
and "A" is the one
she's been running from,

28:19.390 --> 28:20.994
then you're putting
yourself in danger

28:21.100 --> 28:22.158
by communicating with her.

28:22.260 --> 28:23.192
Maybe.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.267
Okay, but she needs us.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.725
A" used and abused you guys.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.388
Why would you want
to help her?

28:28.500 --> 28:30.229
She regrets how
she treated us.

28:30.340 --> 28:32.001
Of course
she's gonna say that.

28:32.110 --> 28:35.079
She manipulates people
to get what she wants.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.408
She's not like that anymore.

28:36.510 --> 28:39.274
She has faked her death
for the past 2 years.

28:39.380 --> 28:41.371
She's definitely
still like that.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.712
She's a sick person.

28:46.820 --> 28:48.014
You need to let her
family deal with this.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.712
Well, we can't tell
her family.

28:49.820 --> 28:51.253
Then I will.

28:51.360 --> 28:54.989
If you do, if you expose her
to the world,

28:55.100 --> 28:56.988
then you're basically
handing her to "A".

28:57.100 --> 28:58.397
Okay, the person
she's been hiding from

28:58.500 --> 28:59.421
for the past 2 years.

28:59.530 --> 29:03.432
And if I don't,
you continue to be a target.

29:03.540 --> 29:05.963
If anything happens to Ali,

29:06.070 --> 29:07.731
I'd never forgive myself...

29:08.980 --> 29:10.106
or you.

29:13.510 --> 29:15.011
Fine.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.145
I won't say anything.

29:17.250 --> 29:18.842
But you need to do
one thing for me.

29:18.950 --> 29:19.985
What's that?

29:20.090 --> 29:22.411
Cut off communication
with Alison.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.329
No secret meetings,

29:24.430 --> 29:27.797
no dropping off packages,
no interaction of any kind.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.754
You can't be serious.

29:29.860 --> 29:31.964
It's the only way
I know you'll be safe.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.970
Where are you up to
in such a rush?

29:43.080 --> 29:45.298
Oh, just picking something up
for a friend in need.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.048
You know, it's nice

29:47.150 --> 29:49.311
that you care about
your friends so much.

29:49.420 --> 29:50.842
It's a great quality.

29:50.950 --> 29:52.349
Don't lose it.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.315
You know, I was gonna stop
by your office tomorrow.

29:57.420 --> 30:00.457
I was surprised to hear that
you spoke up for Mr. Hobbs.

30:00.560 --> 30:04.496
Well, that was
the right thing to do.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.794
Still.

30:05.900 --> 30:06.969
I mean,
not a lot of people would

30:07.070 --> 30:09.061
put themselves out
there like that.

30:09.170 --> 30:10.239
It's a great quality.

30:10.340 --> 30:11.432
Don't lose it.

30:13.470 --> 30:15.006
Seriously.
Thank you.

30:19.950 --> 30:21.110
Hanna.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.517
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

30:22.620 --> 30:24.508
I don't know
why I just did that.

30:24.620 --> 30:26.349
I'm sorry, I got to go.

30:43.140 --> 30:44.129
CeCe told me
she stopped

30:44.240 --> 30:45.400
by the DiLaurentis house

30:45.510 --> 30:47.432
to talk to Alison the night
she went missing.

30:47.540 --> 30:50.100
When CeCe arrived,
she witnessed a fight.

30:50.210 --> 30:51.245
Hey!

30:51.350 --> 30:52.544
Hey! This conversation
isn't over.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.117
It is over, Spencer.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.118
And so are we.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.245
Don't you walk away from me.

30:57.350 --> 30:59.079
Damn it, Ali.
I said, stop!

30:59.190 --> 31:01.511
You're way out
of your league, Spencer.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.315
Am I?

31:03.420 --> 31:04.489
Are you sure about that?

31:07.130 --> 31:09.257
Why don't you put that thing
down before you hurt yourself?

31:13.700 --> 31:15.236
CeCe didn't tell
anyone what she saw,

31:15.340 --> 31:17.331
because Mrs. DiLaurentis
paId her not to.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.362
Mrs. DiLaurentis also
witnessed the fight.

31:30.650 --> 31:31.639
Hey.

31:33.020 --> 31:34.180
Get some rest?

31:36.160 --> 31:38.879
No, I was not resting.

31:38.990 --> 31:41.629
I was just thinking
about the night

31:41.730 --> 31:43.152
that All went missing.

31:43.260 --> 31:45.296
Spencer, you're supposed to be
trying to relax.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.892
Yeah, I can only remember
pieces of the night

31:49.000 --> 31:50.160
because I was
taking the pills back then

31:50.270 --> 31:51.168
and the first thing
I remember

31:51.270 --> 31:53.101
I was in here with Ali
and we were fighting

31:53.210 --> 31:55.974
and the next thing I know
is that I'm out by the barn,

31:56.080 --> 31:57.502
telling the girls
that she's missing

31:57.610 --> 31:59.009
and I thought
I heard her scream.

31:59.110 --> 32:00.543
Why can't you just stop
dredging up the past

32:00.650 --> 32:02.345
and focus on getting
yourself better?

32:05.150 --> 32:06.242
_ Is this the
private Investigator

32:06.350 --> 32:08.409
you hired to follow Melissa?

32:08.520 --> 32:10.385
Were you in my desk?

32:10.490 --> 32:12.526
I told you to stay
out of my ofﬁce, Spencer.

32:12.630 --> 32:14.393
Dad, did you
hire him to follow

32:14.500 --> 32:17.321
Melissa or me?

32:19.230 --> 32:20.162
Do you think

32:20.270 --> 32:22.465
that I had something to do
with Ali's murder?

32:22.570 --> 32:25.459
What I think is that
you're having a tough time

32:25.570 --> 32:27.970
with your withdrawal.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.570
And maybe we should just
call the doctor.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.672
Please don't do that.

32:32.780 --> 32:36.045
Please _don't make me feel
any craZIer than I already do.

32:38.150 --> 32:39.185
( knocking on door)

32:44.360 --> 32:46.021
Hey.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.051
Hi, Toby.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.092
Hey, Mr. Hastings.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.193
Everything okay?

32:52.300 --> 32:53.562
Yeah.

32:53.670 --> 32:55.638
Yeah, you know, I think
Spencer's just been

32:55.740 --> 32:57.367
cooped up
a little too long.

32:57.470 --> 32:59.199
Why don't you guys go
take a walk or something?

32:59.310 --> 33:02.131
I don't want to take
a walk, Dad.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.502
I want to know the truth.

33:04.710 --> 33:06.177
Just be you,

33:06.280 --> 33:07.304
could be back in about an hour
it will be great.

33:07.410 --> 33:08.547
And I'll have dinner ready.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.641
Yeah, let's go for a walk
and get some fresh air.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.329
Okay.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.044
Okay what?

33:39.150 --> 33:40.674
I'll stay away from her.

33:40.780 --> 33:42.145
You mean it?

33:42.250 --> 33:44.718
But I have to drop off
that envelope.

33:44.820 --> 33:47.311
Ali's depending on it
and I gave her my word.

33:47.420 --> 33:48.387
And then you're done?

33:48.490 --> 33:50.412
Yes.

33:59.430 --> 34:01.432
I'm doing this
for you, Emily.

34:02.770 --> 34:05.307
Because I love you so much.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.627
( cell phone ringing )

35:04.730 --> 35:06.266
Galassi Agency.

35:06.370 --> 35:07.428
Hi.

35:07.530 --> 35:10.260
Hi, my name is
Victoria BlacloNell.

35:10.370 --> 35:11.439
I work at Rosewood
High School,

35:11.540 --> 35:12.609
where Ezra Fitz works.

35:12.710 --> 35:13.631
Oh, hi.

35:13.740 --> 35:15.173
You're in Pennsylvania, right?

35:15.280 --> 35:16.577
Yeah, yeah, I am.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.477
Actually we just found out
about his book

35:18.580 --> 35:20.639
and we wanted _to throw him
a little surprise party.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.342
Do you know if there's
a publication date

35:22.450 --> 35:23.474
set for that yet?

35:23.580 --> 35:24.842
No.

35:24.950 --> 35:26.611
But he's actually here now
discussing it with Anna.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.688
So if you call back tomorrow,

35:28.790 --> 35:30.451
I should have
more information then.

35:33.660 --> 35:34.649
( knocking on door)

35:35.900 --> 35:37.549
Toby.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.264
Is Spencer here?

35:39.370 --> 35:40.519
What?

35:41.640 --> 35:42.561
Ithought
she was with you.

35:42.670 --> 35:43.739
She was.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.307
She asked me to go into the
Brew and get some coffees

35:45.410 --> 35:46.809
and when I turned around
she was gone.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.343
WOMAN:
Spencer?

35:53.750 --> 35:55.547
I need to talk to you.

35:55.650 --> 35:57.379
Is everything all right?

35:57.480 --> 35:59.812
Do you think
that I hurt Ali?

35:59.920 --> 36:01.615
What?

36:01.720 --> 36:04.553
Do you and my father

36:04.660 --> 36:07.185
have some kind of agreement
to keep it quiet?

36:07.290 --> 36:09.429
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:09.530 --> 36:10.599
Don't lie to me.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.361
Please.

36:12.470 --> 36:15.837
Please, okay,
I can't take any more lies.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.403
You don't look well, Spencer.

36:20.510 --> 36:22.307
I'm calling your parents.

36:22.410 --> 36:24.378
Please, it's a simple
question, okay?

36:24.480 --> 36:25.606
Did you or did you not

36:25.710 --> 36:27.507
see me standing
with the shovel that night?

36:27.610 --> 36:28.713
And if you did
see me hurt Ali,

36:28.820 --> 36:31.709
then why didn't you
just call the cops?

36:31.820 --> 36:33.185
You're hurting me.

36:39.490 --> 36:41.697
I want you to leave...

36:43.560 --> 36:44.629
now.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.252
Aria?

37:14.700 --> 37:15.894
Where are you going?

37:16.000 --> 37:16.750
Ezra's moving forward
with the book.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.293
What?

37:18.400 --> 37:19.628
He's meeting with his agent
in New York right now

37:19.730 --> 37:20.765
discussing
a release date.

37:20.870 --> 37:22.565
Release date?
Can you just stop?

37:22.670 --> 37:24.501
I cannot believe
that I actually believed

37:24.610 --> 37:26.908
he was going to destroy the
book to save our relationship.

37:27.010 --> 37:28.500
Now I know
that everything he says

37:28.610 --> 37:29.770
or has ever said is a lie.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.233
It's a big fat lie.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.647
Why are you going to
Principal Hackett's house?

37:32.750 --> 37:34.411
'Cause I'm telling him
everything about me and Ezra.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.771
What do you mean,
you're telling him everything?

37:35.880 --> 37:36.847
I'm not going
to be the only one

37:36.950 --> 37:37.917
that suffers from this,
Hanna.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.783
Aria, if you tell
Principal Hackett

37:39.890 --> 37:41.380
about your relationship,

37:42.590 --> 37:43.113
Ezra is not just gonna suffer,
he's going to go to jail.

37:43.220 --> 37:45.927
Are you taking his side?

37:46.030 --> 37:47.850
No, of course not.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.791
Look, I'm not saying
you shouldn't do this.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.788
I just-- I want you
to be clear about

37:51.900 --> 37:53.322
what will happen if you do.

37:53.430 --> 37:54.533
Oh, I'm clear.

37:54.640 --> 37:58.269
Aria, look, if this gets out,
it's gonna hurt you, too.

37:58.370 --> 38:00.600
It'll be in the papers
all over town.

38:00.710 --> 38:03.406
Yeah. Do you think I really
give a crap about that?

38:05.810 --> 38:07.801
Look, this is gonna affect
your family too.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.409
Are you sure
you want to do this?

38:30.600 --> 38:31.669
You did the right thing.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.829
Maybe I did.
Maybe I didn't.

38:33.940 --> 38:35.771
So I'll meet you back
at your place?

38:35.880 --> 38:37.575
No, I really want to be
by myself right now.

38:37.680 --> 38:38.908
Aria, I'm not gonna
leave you alone.

38:39.010 --> 38:40.841
Hanna, you are not
listening to me.

38:40.950 --> 38:43.316
I don't want
your company, okay?

38:43.420 --> 38:44.785
Look, I know
what you're going through.

38:44.890 --> 38:45.948
I've been
through this myself.

38:46.050 --> 38:47.381
I don't want to talk to you.

38:47.490 --> 38:48.582
I don't want to talk to anyone.

38:49.590 --> 38:51.421
I want to be left alone.
Is that too much to ask?

38:52.860 --> 38:53.849
Okay.

39:07.810 --> 39:09.038
You beat me back.

39:10.580 --> 39:11.604
Are you still
up for cooking

39:11.710 --> 39:13.109
or do you want to go
out instead?

39:14.950 --> 39:17.441
I'm not really that hungry.

39:17.550 --> 39:18.619
It's getting kind of late.

39:18.720 --> 39:19.948
I should probably
check up on Aria.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.555
Oh.

39:22.660 --> 39:24.628
All right.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.482
Well, I'll just see you
tomorrow I guess.

39:29.660 --> 39:31.093
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.937
Are we okay?

39:42.840 --> 39:44.899
I don't like being
given ultimatums, Paige.

39:45.010 --> 39:46.648
Neither do I.

39:49.550 --> 39:50.619
Good night.

40:06.130 --> 40:07.563
( door slams )

40:09.640 --> 40:11.858
( music playing )

40:21.180 --> 40:22.943
You need help, Spencer.

40:46.570 --> 40:49.676
Hey, Mike let me in.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.429
Are you going somewhere?

40:51.550 --> 40:52.699
Yep.

40:52.810 --> 40:54.949
Where?

40:55.050 --> 40:56.074
No idea.

40:56.180 --> 40:58.489
What do you mean,
you don't know?

40:58.590 --> 41:00.546
You're just gonna keep driving
until you figure it out?

41:00.650 --> 41:02.515
That's the plan.

41:04.260 --> 41:05.454
I got to get
out of here.

41:05.560 --> 41:06.720
Hey, let's talk about this.

41:06.830 --> 41:08.127
I don't want to talk.
Then I'll come with you.

41:08.230 --> 41:09.128
I don't want that either.

41:09.230 --> 41:10.629
Then what do you want?

41:10.730 --> 41:12.129
I want for you to get
out of my way, Emily.
