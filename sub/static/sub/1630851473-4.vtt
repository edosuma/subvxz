The following programme contains
graphic images.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.520
♪ There's a world outside my door

00:15.560 --> 00:17.960
♪ I don't know it anymore

00:18.000 --> 00:22.920
♪ I'm gonna stay here now

00:22.960 --> 00:25.400
♪ Take a breath and say a prayer

00:25.440 --> 00:27.760
♪ Find the strength
in my despair

00:27.800 --> 00:32.720
♪ It's not gonna take me down

00:32.760 --> 00:39.040
♪ I can see clearly now
the rain has gone

00:42.920 --> 00:48.840
♪ I accept all the things that I
cannot change

00:48.880 --> 00:51.840
♪ It's gonna be a bright

00:51.880 --> 00:56.840
♪ Bright, sunshiny day ♪

01:04.680 --> 01:06.520
Oh, God, it's grim down here.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.720
Looks like the stuff that lurks
in cups under Flick's bed.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.960
She still hasn't gone
- home yet?
- She's claimed asylum.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.160
Don't pretend you're not thrilled.

01:17.520 --> 01:20.680
Hydrogen sulphide levels
are rising.

01:24.720 --> 01:28.000
High enough exposure to hydrogen
sulphide and they're looking at

01:28.040 --> 01:31.520
cortical pseudolaminar necrosis.
Which in English means...?

01:31.560 --> 01:36.400
- Brain cell death.
- Not unlike the
kind experienced by loved-up
teenagers.

01:38.240 --> 01:42.640
Well, actually, experiments show
that sex causes neurogenesis

01:42.680 --> 01:46.760
which improves cognition.
That's only been proven in rats.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.640
- Christ on a bike!
- Ha-ha.

01:51.680 --> 01:56.320
I call her Sharon, after my
- ex-wife.
- She's a stunner.

01:56.360 --> 02:00.960
Not the kind of girl you'd take home
- though.
- Not with these gas issues.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.720
- Where is it?
- Just on the left here.

02:03.760 --> 02:08.520
- I didn't touch it.
- Any chance of you
actually putting those masks on?

02:19.880 --> 02:22.360
Hey. Would you mind?

02:23.760 --> 02:26.000
Hold this.

02:38.920 --> 02:42.120
It's alright, mate,
you're alright, mate. It's alright.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.040
It's alright. Calm down, calm down.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.960
Well that could've gone
- better.
- Yep.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.400
Just leaving now. I'd say at least
an hour, an hour and a half?

03:07.840 --> 03:11.160
Dot... Yeah?
Do you need a hand?

03:11.200 --> 03:15.480
Aha, bless. Little bit of dad humour
there, well done, very good.

03:15.520 --> 03:19.640
When they say dad joke,
they just mean bad joke.

03:19.680 --> 03:22.480
There's only one thing worse
than finding a rat in your fatberg.

03:22.520 --> 03:26.800
- So gross.
- I think we can safely say
it didn't die of natural causes.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.560
You'd better tell Betsy we're
dealing with a double homicide.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.840
Apparently the body parts were found
in this section here.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.960
Which is fed by each of these
sewer lines in turn.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.240
So the victim could've been dropped
down a manhole in an area

03:44.280 --> 03:47.680
spanning half of Manchester.
That's about the size of it.

03:50.480 --> 03:55.240
It's like Stonehenge,
but made of shit.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.680
Something for our third-year
students to get their teeth into.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.840
Cheer up, Dominique,
it might never happen.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.480
My partner's a nut job,
- so it already has.
- Partner?

04:09.080 --> 04:11.400
Er, Megan?

04:11.440 --> 04:14.480
Fuck's sake, Steve.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.480
Right, let's see what we've got
before Maxine cuts him into pieces.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.640
Well, someone's already beaten her
to it. But minus his left hand,

04:20.680 --> 04:23.120
he's all there.
Unlike our perpetrator,

04:23.160 --> 04:25.440
who, I'm guessing, probably isn't.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.640
- He makes Steve looked tanned.
- Oi!

04:28.680 --> 04:32.440
He's been saponified. He's basically
soap. What do we know?

04:32.480 --> 04:35.040
This is 28-year-old Sol James,

04:35.080 --> 04:38.440
whose DNA is helpfully on police
record thanks to a 2014 conviction

04:38.480 --> 04:42.240
for shoplifting.
- Ligature marks.
- And...oh, God...

04:42.280 --> 04:45.720
extensive blunt force trauma.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.040
I can see a rainbow.
: A rainbow?

04:48.080 --> 04:51.720
A bruise is caused when capillaries
are damaged and leak blood.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.480
As the body reabsorbs the
constituent parts of that blood,

04:54.520 --> 04:58.440
- the bruise changes colour.
- When we
see bruising of several different
colours,

04:58.480 --> 05:01.880
we know that the bruises were caused
at different times, which is a red
flag for...

05:01.920 --> 05:04.480
- Domestic violence.
- And signs of
domestic violence on a corpse

05:04.520 --> 05:07.960
is a red flag for... Spousal murder.
Roses are red, violets are blue.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.640
All these colours at once,
suggest your spouse killed you.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.800
Catchy.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.720
Sol James's husband is
a Mr David West.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.960
West. Very popular name for
psychopaths.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.080
- Name one other than Fred.
- Rose.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.280
Mr West?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.360
It must be a terrible shock.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.920
Is there someone you can call?

05:31.960 --> 05:34.760
How can you be certain it's him?

05:34.800 --> 05:38.000
DNA analysis. Sol's profile is on
the police database.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.760
- I want to see him.
- I'm not sure
that's a good idea right now.

05:41.800 --> 05:46.240
Perhaps you're right.
I mean, I'm in bits.

05:48.040 --> 05:51.040
I just want to use your
bathroom, if you don't mind.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.520
I hope you don't mind me asking,
Mr West,

05:57.560 --> 05:59.720
but why didn't you report Sol
missing?

05:59.760 --> 06:02.760
Four weeks is a long time.
Not for Sol.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.080
He was always going AWOL.

06:06.120 --> 06:10.880
Usually after a row.
He always came back eventually.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.680
Did you ever hit him?

06:18.720 --> 06:22.720
- What?
- There were some marks.
On Sol's back.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.440
Bollocks.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.120
I guess grief affects everyone
differently.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.880
This is a video of Sol and
David doing entirely consensual...

06:40.920 --> 06:43.600
rough stuff to each other.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.600
His idea, not mine.

06:45.640 --> 06:49.760
It took some convincing,
- I can tell you.
- Each to their own.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.920
Sorry, that's me.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.240
It's from Sol.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.240
You said he was dead.
What does it say?

07:05.360 --> 07:09.000
'Missing you.
Home soon for Meatloaf.'

07:09.040 --> 07:12.240
- Meatloaf?
- SOL
Meatloaf! Meatloaf!

07:12.280 --> 07:15.120
It's our safe word.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.400
Did Sol have fingerprint lock on
- his phone?
- Yes.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.280
And he was left-handed?
How do you know?

07:24.320 --> 07:27.480
He didn't look the type.
What? For kinky sex or murder?

07:27.520 --> 07:30.560
- Either.
- One isn't indicative
of the other, you know?

07:30.600 --> 07:33.240
The historical bruises were our
probable cause.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.280
That video's just torpedoed our
grounds for a search.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.680
Luminol didn't show any blood
in the bathroom anyway.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.600
But if he was clued up enough to use
the right saw, he might also know

07:41.640 --> 07:44.840
to use oxygenated bleach.
You did sneaky Luminol!

07:44.880 --> 07:47.520
What do you think I've got in the
bag Betsy, my gym kit?

07:47.560 --> 07:50.880
Plausible deniability, Wolfe.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.680
So the last text that definitely
came from Sol,

07:53.720 --> 07:56.600
was taken at 23:46 on the
night he left home.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.120
We know it was him,
because it included a photo.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.880
That might explain at
least some of the five DNA profiles

08:02.920 --> 08:05.560
we found on Sol's body,
mostly sweat and saliva.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.880
Interestingly, we also
found traces of sodium borate,

08:08.920 --> 08:11.680
it's a chemical that's found
in strong detergents.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.600
Maybe an attempt by the killer to
clean away evidence.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.440
Historically Sol misspells
the word "you're"

08:17.480 --> 08:21.080
as "your". But in the texts that are
sent later,

08:21.120 --> 08:23.920
both types of "your" are always
used correctly.

08:23.960 --> 08:26.800
It seems that our killer knows
that good grammar

08:26.840 --> 08:28.800
is the difference
between knowing your shit,

08:28.840 --> 08:31.720
and everyone knowing you're shit!

08:31.760 --> 08:34.520
Good speller, knows his way
around freezer bags and detergent.

08:34.560 --> 08:37.520
If this guy wasn't a homicidal
maniac he would be a keeper.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.880
How are we coming along on finding
the crime scene?

08:39.920 --> 08:43.720
Aluminium oxide. It's a chemical
that's used in sandblasting.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.320
So, he was in the
vicinity of building work.

08:46.360 --> 08:50.240
It hardly leads us to a crime scene.
Half of Manchester are getting loft
conversions.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.400
What if we're not looking for a
crime scene but where he was first?

08:53.440 --> 08:56.400
Maybe we should phone all the clubs
on the list of Sol's haunts to see
if any of them

08:56.440 --> 09:00.440
were having building work when Sol
- disappeared.
- You think like a cop.

09:00.480 --> 09:04.200
Are you sure you're not undercover?
No.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.560
It's just a joke.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.880
Dad joke. Bad joke.
But it's a very good idea.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.680
Let's divvy the list
and start phoning.

09:18.560 --> 09:22.520
I'm DCI Betsy Chambers, and this
is my colleague, Wolfe Kinteh.

09:22.560 --> 09:26.320
We'd like to have a chat with you
about the opening night after your
refurbishment.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.520
That was weeks ago.

09:30.280 --> 09:34.000
Can you roll it on a bit, see if we
can find out if he left with anyone?

09:34.040 --> 09:36.840
I can do. But he didn't.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.320
Remember the comings and goings of
all the punters, do you?

09:40.360 --> 09:44.000
I remember his.
He's a frequent flyer.

09:44.040 --> 09:47.040
As in, he comes to this club
- a lot?
- As in, he gets pissed

09:47.080 --> 09:49.960
and I make him fly out the door
a lot.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.040
Not everyone has what it takes to
be cabin crew, Dale,

09:54.080 --> 09:57.680
but you've got it in spades.
He's a first-class idiot.

09:57.720 --> 10:01.880
- Is he in trouble?
- The worst kind.
Thank you for your help, Dale.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.680
As you were more than
a little hands on with him,

10:04.720 --> 10:07.800
would you mind if I take a
sample for elimination?

10:07.840 --> 10:11.360
Fuck! Is he dead?
As dead as disco.

10:13.600 --> 10:18.320
The deniability is not plausible if
I have to wait this long for you.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.800
What was the make
and model of Sol's car?

10:23.840 --> 10:27.960
It's a green BMW.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.200
- Reg number V682
- K—KAE.
It's right there.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.120
Can I help you?

10:44.160 --> 10:48.280
How long has this car been here?
Over a month.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.160
You didn't think to tell anyone?

10:51.200 --> 10:55.280
Are you the police?
I am. He's forensics.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.920
- Professor Wolfe Kinteh.
- Doesn't
it just boil your piss how people

10:58.960 --> 11:02.720
call it a blood splatter instead of
- blood spatter.
- It certainly does.

11:02.760 --> 11:06.120
I'm afraid to tell you
your colleagues in blue have
shit for brains.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.400
That is not a newsflash.
Why do you say that?

11:09.440 --> 11:14.680
Four weeks ago, the car kipper parks
his beamer here to go to Affinity.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.520
The car kipper?
That's what he does.

11:17.560 --> 11:21.040
Gets pissed in the club and sleeps
it off in the car.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.320
Only on this occasion he didn't.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.880
He comes out of the club and gets
into a different car

11:26.920 --> 11:30.040
that's waiting outside. When he
didn't come back the next day

11:30.080 --> 11:32.640
to get his beamer,
I rang the police.

11:32.680 --> 11:37.200
Do you know what they said?
We'll send some officers out
straight away?

11:37.240 --> 11:41.320
That no one's been reported missing.
Can't get the staff.

11:41.360 --> 11:44.560
Clearly not.
Although they turned me down.

11:44.600 --> 11:48.320
No crips in pips.
I'm sorry about that.

11:48.360 --> 11:51.160
I don't suppose you got the
registration for the car he went

11:51.200 --> 11:55.920
off in, did you?
No. It was a yellow Citroen Xsara.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.320
I didn't realise the registration
was important

11:58.360 --> 12:00.840
until he didn't come back.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.400
I did get something else though.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.880
Hang on.

12:07.040 --> 12:10.200
No crips in pips. Poor kid.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.440
Shame there's no CCTV.
Probably cheaper to have him

12:14.480 --> 12:18.160
sitting out here all night on less
than minimum wage.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.360
The driver of the car
was chain smoking,

12:23.400 --> 12:26.480
flicking butts out of the
window into the gutter.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.400
When the car kipper didn't come back
I went over and retrieved 'em,

12:30.440 --> 12:33.160
bagged 'em up as evidence in case
anyone came asking.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.520
There must be a dozen cigarette
butts inside that gutter.

12:35.560 --> 12:40.080
But not three the same. White tip,
burgundy lipstick.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.720
That's good thinking.

12:42.760 --> 12:45.920
I've got to compensate somehow.
Did you get a look at her?

12:45.960 --> 12:50.440
- Too far away.
- You know, you ought
to consider a career in forensics,

12:50.480 --> 12:55.040
- my man.
- You'd take me on?
In a heartbeat.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.160
We serve Fallowfield,
not downtown LA.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.040
When you text saying we might have
a serial killer on our hands,

13:07.080 --> 13:10.000
I can only assume someone's been
smothered in Rice Krispies.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.720
Welcome to pet cemetery.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.160
I say this because I love you,
Steve. You need a hobby.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.480
Now I bet that you've assumed that
I've ordered these by size,

13:19.520 --> 13:23.800
but I haven't. I've ordered them by
stage of decomposition.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.960
So, the first mice
are dry remains,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.080
the second mice and the rat,
they're advanced decay.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.480
The squirrel is in active decay and
the fox is in the bloat stage.

13:33.520 --> 13:37.480
But they've ended up in size order,
too, which is very telling.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.520
- Of what?
- That these animals
were killed in size order.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.360
Someone has started off small and
got bigger over time.

13:43.400 --> 13:48.800
So, assuming that whoever killed
these guys also killed Sol,

13:48.840 --> 13:52.320
we are dealing with someone that
practiced on animals

13:52.360 --> 13:54.720
and graduated to a human,
which suggests...

13:54.760 --> 13:57.760
He's just getting started.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.520
I mean, obviously I don't want
anyone else to die,

14:00.560 --> 14:03.680
but this is the sort of case
that I dream about.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.160
I'll tell Betsy.
You get off home, Steve,

14:08.200 --> 14:10.480
have a cold shower or
something.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.960
But very good work.

15:24.360 --> 15:28.360
See?

15:28.400 --> 15:31.320
I would describe it as a howl.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.160
But I'm not sure I would describe it
as a wolf's howl.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.040
I think that would
be more of a...

15:42.520 --> 15:46.320
No, that was more of a...

15:48.640 --> 15:51.480
Look, I know it's a
disappointment to you, Wolfe,

15:51.520 --> 15:53.920
because I'm fairly certain
it's on your bucket list,

15:53.960 --> 15:58.960
but I do not think you are being
targeted by a serial killer.

16:01.280 --> 16:05.640
Can Betsy trace the phone?
No. She's narrowed down its location

16:05.680 --> 16:08.280
but it's still an area that covers
half the city.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.840
Careful, I'm filthy.
Oh, are you now?

16:15.880 --> 16:19.640
No, I'm actually filthy, Steve.
I've been disposing of fatberg.

16:19.680 --> 16:23.000
- I don't care.
- You should, fatbergs
are full of super bugs.

16:23.040 --> 16:27.160
You are worth contracting an
antibiotic resistant infection for.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.520
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Whoa.

16:36.560 --> 16:40.040
Massively miscalculating
how sexy that would be.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.560
Hello?
- Hi.
Can I speak to Liza, please.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.280
I just missed a call from
- her.
- Oh, I'm afraid

16:50.320 --> 16:52.600
she's on the line to someone
else at the moment.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.480
Can I get her to give you
a call back?

16:54.520 --> 16:57.560
I don't suppose you know
who she's on the other line to?

16:57.600 --> 17:01.360
Let me just clarify, Liza.
Yes.
- The files were supposed

17:01.400 --> 17:04.560
to be ready by five but they're now
going to be ready at three?

17:04.600 --> 17:07.160
That's right.

17:07.200 --> 17:12.880
And who is it on my team that you've
been speaking to about these files?

17:12.920 --> 17:15.600
- I believe that was Bibi.
- Well...

17:15.640 --> 17:18.280
I'll let Bibi know
that they're ready.

17:18.320 --> 17:22.160
OK. Can I just say that
your reputation precedes you.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.400
Well, your reputation
precedes you as well, Lisa.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.560
- Liza.
- Liza, sorry.

17:27.600 --> 17:31.720
- OK, thanks.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.600
I've just done something really
fucking clever.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.040
Have we got
a student called Bibi?

17:43.080 --> 17:45.760
We've got one called Baby.

17:45.800 --> 17:49.480
Did you order any files from the
- archive warehouse?
- No.

17:49.520 --> 17:52.040
Should I have?

17:55.120 --> 17:59.120
Anyway, back to my clever thing.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.800
I took a DNA profile off the
cigarette butts

18:02.840 --> 18:05.360
that the car park attendant
kept as evidence.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.600
It's not a match for anyone on the
police system,

18:07.640 --> 18:10.680
but I was able to use epigenetic
markers in the DNA

18:10.720 --> 18:13.200
to determine that the individual
is female

18:13.240 --> 18:15.200
and between the ages 25 and 50.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.840
I then checked with DVLA and got a
list of all the people

18:17.880 --> 18:20.640
who fit that profile and are the
registered owner

18:20.680 --> 18:24.120
of a yellow Citroen Xsara.
There were a few,

18:24.160 --> 18:28.120
but I then crosschecked that list
against addresses inside the area

18:28.160 --> 18:30.800
covered by the cell phone mast that
the messages from Sol's phone

18:30.840 --> 18:34.000
bounced off.
There's only one name, Wolfe.

18:35.320 --> 18:40.360
Sarah Goodwin.
Anyone on the team acting weird
as far as you're concerned?

18:43.200 --> 18:47.480
Seriously, Steve put a bit of
roadkill in rot order

18:47.520 --> 18:50.120
and you practically gave him
a rosette.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.080
Women don't tend to be
serial killers.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.040
Women can be anything
they want to be, Betsy.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.720
- Sarah Goodwin?
- That's right.
DCI Betsy Chambers.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.760
We need to ask you some questions.
About what?

19:17.800 --> 19:20.480
May we come in?
Is there a problem?

19:20.520 --> 19:26.280
- It shouldn't take long.
- Yep,
I'm just on the phone, upstairs,

19:26.320 --> 19:28.920
- I won't be a minute.
- Looks the part.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.840
This case is revealing a very
judgmental side to you.

19:34.160 --> 19:37.400
Sweet Jesus.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.480
What the hell is that?

19:41.680 --> 19:44.240
Literally, lipstick on a pig.

19:44.280 --> 19:48.640
I think it's fair to say she's got
something of an interest in death.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.440
And questionable taste in decor.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.880
Can they still get fleas?

19:57.720 --> 20:00.120
You're looking at my creations.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.360
You made these yourself?
- Mm-hmm.
- They're quite something.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.120
It helps me to unwind after work.
And what is it that you do?

20:07.160 --> 20:10.400
I'm a make-up artist. For the dead.

20:10.440 --> 20:15.960
- Unusual line of work.
- I had a
calling to it a few years ago

20:16.000 --> 20:19.880
when my mum died. I went to the
undertakers to see her

20:19.920 --> 20:23.040
and I found they'd made her out to
look like someone else.

20:23.080 --> 20:27.920
Honestly, it was like losing her
- twice.
- I'm sorry.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.120
So I redid her make up.

20:31.160 --> 20:34.080
And as I was putting the colour on
her cheeks,

20:34.120 --> 20:38.800
for a second it felt like I was
putting the life back into her.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.680
It's the same with the creatures.

20:41.720 --> 20:46.400
People think that it's about death,
but actually, it's about life.

20:46.440 --> 20:50.360
It's about preserving it. Eternally.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.280
Have you ever met a man called
Sol James?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.840
He's an old school friend.
Why do you ask?

20:55.880 --> 21:01.240
When was the last time you saw him?
Three or four weeks ago.

21:01.280 --> 21:04.840
- Is he OK?
- You picked him up from
Affinity nightclub.

21:04.880 --> 21:09.600
That's right. We came back here
and had a pot of tea.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.600
Maybe young men have changed a bit
since my day, but back then

21:12.640 --> 21:15.520
when you left the club in the early
hours, you wanted a kebab and a-

21:15.560 --> 21:18.280
Were you sleeping with him, Sarah?

21:18.320 --> 21:23.720
Sol's gay. And I'm asexual,
actually, so no.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.880
We had a pot of tea.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.120
Can I use your bathroom?

21:29.160 --> 21:32.080
Yeah, it's just through there.

21:33.480 --> 21:35.560
Thank you.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.080
What the hell are you doing in here?

22:22.120 --> 22:26.560
Where do you get the animals, Sarah?
They can't all be roadkill.

22:26.600 --> 22:30.600
Different sources.
The mice are reptile food.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.880
They're alive when you buy them?

22:33.920 --> 22:36.640
You kill them, so you can
return them to life?

22:36.680 --> 22:38.960
Bloody hell.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.080
The missing left hand.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.560
No, no, no, don't go near that,
- please!
- No.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.040
You have got no right!

22:56.120 --> 22:58.040
Is this me?

22:59.280 --> 23:02.400
- What?
- Is this a proxy for me!

23:02.440 --> 23:05.560
I don't know what you're
talking about.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.640
What do you use this for?
It's a desiccant.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.280
It draws out moisture
from animal's skin.

23:12.320 --> 23:16.080
It stops them rotting.
Did it stop Sol from rotting?

23:16.120 --> 23:18.560
What?

23:19.680 --> 23:23.720
- Wolfe?
- We found traces of
this chemical on Sol's body.

23:25.880 --> 23:29.080
- Sol's dead?
- Probable cause.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.840
What happened to him?
Sarah Goodwin, I'm arresting you

23:32.880 --> 23:36.120
on suspicion of the murder of Sol
James. You do not have to say

23:36.160 --> 23:38.760
anything-You think I killed him?

23:38.800 --> 23:41.560
..when questioned something which
you later rely on in court.

23:41.600 --> 23:45.080
He was in here. Maybe he touched the
- powder.
- It was in his hair.

23:45.120 --> 23:49.600
On his torso.
OK, we did sleep together.

23:49.640 --> 23:52.840
And I was using it earlier
that evening. Maybe that's why.

23:52.880 --> 23:55.800
So, why did you lie?

23:55.840 --> 24:00.840
- Because I was embarrassed.
- Anything
you do say may be given in evidence.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.880
Hey.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.120
I got us some stuff.
I'm going out.

24:12.160 --> 24:15.280
- Where?
- I can't tell you that.
Well do tell,

24:15.320 --> 24:18.440
otherwise you're not going.
- I'm going out with Mum.
- Where?

24:18.480 --> 24:23.080
- Like I said.
- I thought you two
weren't even speaking?

24:23.120 --> 24:26.800
We weren't, but something's come up
and it's important.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.880
I really wish there was just one
area in my life

24:31.920 --> 24:34.200
that wasn't shrouded in mystery.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.960
Maybe the real issue is your
unhealthy need to solve

24:37.000 --> 24:39.040
all mysteries.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.600
Right, see you later.

25:16.520 --> 25:19.120
How's it stalking if it's family?

25:47.200 --> 25:49.520
I can't believe we're
having to do this.

25:49.560 --> 25:52.400
Of all the stupid things!
Being judgmental doesn't help.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.200
I know, I know, I just...
I'm so angry.

25:57.880 --> 26:01.040
You better not tell your dad.
Yeah, no shit.

26:01.080 --> 26:06.520
- Valerie Burgess?
- That's her.
Wouldn't catch me doing it
unprotected!

26:48.640 --> 26:51.000
I don't think Bibi's gonna show.

27:18.160 --> 27:22.200
What's with the archive files?
You tell me.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.720
You seemed to be eyeballing them
pretty closely as I walked in.

27:25.760 --> 27:28.560
I have no idea what you're talking
- about.
- Something is going on

27:28.600 --> 27:31.960
in this department, Dot, and if
polygraph testing were reliable

27:32.000 --> 27:35.080
I'd have all of you hooked up
one by one.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.560
Flick and Val have been
lying to me, too.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.920
- Are you sleeping OK?
- Don't you dare!
Only cos yesterday you thought

27:40.960 --> 27:43.120
the killer was trying to communicate
- with you.
- She was. The howling.

27:43.160 --> 27:47.880
The wolf's head. She couldn't have
been clearer.

27:52.080 --> 27:55.240
The precipitin testing has revealed

27:55.280 --> 27:58.240
that at least some of the blood is
- human.
- Great.

27:58.280 --> 28:03.040
There are also traces of Sol's DNA.
Have it written up for the CPS.

28:04.080 --> 28:08.680
I would've liked to see more.
It was a pretty low-grade sample

28:08.720 --> 28:12.120
given we think he was butchered
- there.
- There is also a chance

28:12.160 --> 28:14.240
that the human blood
could be Sarah's.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.800
You don't use knives like that
without getting the odd nick or two.

28:18.920 --> 28:22.640
I also found something interesting
when I analysed the blood sample

28:22.680 --> 28:24.920
after Sarah was arrested.

28:24.960 --> 28:30.200
Her HCG levels indicate that she's
about four weeks pregnant.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.720
- Well?
- Sarah says she wanted
a baby to fill the void

28:35.760 --> 28:38.480
left by her mother's death.
Sol was the sperm donor.

28:38.520 --> 28:41.400
Why didn't she just tell us that?
Sol only agreed to do it

28:41.440 --> 28:44.800
on the condition that no one would
ever find out. David in particular.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.600
Looks like she wasn't lying when she
said it's life rather than death

28:47.640 --> 28:49.960
- that interests her.
- None of this
means she didn't kill him.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.080
Widow spiders kill their mate
after sex. Val probably wishes

28:53.120 --> 28:56.080
she'd devoured me once she got what
she needed.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.920
Maggy doesn't reckon
Sol died on that table.

28:58.960 --> 29:02.360
Maybe Sarah killed him somewhere
else.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.280
Problem?

29:04.320 --> 29:07.760
Listen, you've got two choices.
You go on your accord,

29:07.800 --> 29:10.240
or I'll take you over there myself
and the chair'll stay here.

29:10.280 --> 29:13.240
- Go on, then!
- What's going on?
This idiot won't leave.

29:13.280 --> 29:16.680
Not until you come and clean
the cars you pissed on.

29:16.720 --> 29:20.480
I warned you. Every time I look over
there he's staring me out.

29:20.520 --> 29:24.360
You're paranoid, mate. A guilty
conscience will do that.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.800
- What guilty conscience?
- I know
you had beef with the lad who died.

29:27.840 --> 29:30.960
I didn't have beef with him,
- he was an idiot!
- Whatever.

29:32.440 --> 29:35.240
I will fuck you up. Doesn't bother
me you're on wheels!

29:35.280 --> 29:39.920
- Oi! Calm yourself!
- You know,
it would be easy to assume

29:39.960 --> 29:42.920
it's some feeling of superiority
that causes you to act the way

29:42.960 --> 29:46.400
that you do. But I wonder if it's
the opposite.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.680
I can see how anabolic steroids
would initially have been appealing.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.880
All that muscle mass,
seemingly for free.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.160
But then the bill arrives,
the 'roid rage

29:54.200 --> 29:56.920
and the uncontrollable tears.
Not to mention the shrivelled balls

29:56.960 --> 29:59.080
and dysfunctional penis.

29:59.120 --> 30:02.160
You gotta wonder, mate, was it
really worth it?

30:04.520 --> 30:08.280
You're a clever guy,
aren't you? Maybe too clever.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.800
Step away now, Dale, if I was you.

30:15.320 --> 30:19.560
I'm telling you, he's a wrong'un.
You ought to look into him.

30:21.880 --> 30:25.880
Maybe we should.
If only you'd taken a swab.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.200
Both of them.

30:53.240 --> 30:56.120
You know you could tell me anything,
right?

30:56.160 --> 30:59.080
Of all the rubbish parents come out
with, that has got to be

30:59.120 --> 31:02.400
the biggest one. No, Dad, there's
a vast myriad of things

31:02.440 --> 31:05.400
I can't tell you cos you'd
either get too mad or too sad,

31:05.440 --> 31:07.920
or it'd somehow blow
your tiny mind.

31:07.960 --> 31:11.280
I know you went to the sexual health
clinic and that hasn't blown my
tiny mind.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.680
- No?
- I find the idea that you
have either had sex

31:13.720 --> 31:18.560
or thinking of having sex
completely unacceptable,

31:18.600 --> 31:21.960
but if it has to happen then I want
you to be safe.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.360
So you'd be OK with it?
OK is a stretch

31:24.400 --> 31:26.920
but I am not losing my shit, am I?

31:26.960 --> 31:31.880
Well, that is very good to know.
Thanks, Dad.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.040
Oh, my God! You're having sex!
Oh, no!

31:39.080 --> 31:41.280
You're planning on having sex?
Also no!

31:41.320 --> 31:43.160
What were you doing at the
sexual health clinic?

31:43.200 --> 31:46.480
Mum was getting tested.
Tested for what?

31:46.520 --> 31:49.360
Well, not pregnancy, Dad.

31:49.400 --> 31:54.040
- STIs?
- Apparently Jeff
prefers things natural.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.200
That's way too much information.
How do you think I felt?

31:58.520 --> 32:01.960
Look, the tests will probably come
back clear, don't mention to Mum

32:02.000 --> 32:04.920
that you know anything.
She seemed pretty low.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.360
What makes you say that?

32:07.400 --> 32:10.840
When she dropped me back she gave me
a hug and she sort of

32:10.880 --> 32:13.520
like...wouldn't let go.

32:16.120 --> 32:20.800
Oh. Don't go soft. She brought it
on herself, remember?

33:13.480 --> 33:16.800
Your destination
is on your left.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.920
What the hell were you thinking?
The killer told me to come alone.

35:20.960 --> 35:24.040
If they'd seen a police car
rolling up, they might not have
left the hand.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.480
You're assuming that they knew it
would be you on the receiving end

35:26.520 --> 35:29.840
- of that text.
- It would explain
- the woolly jumper.
- What?

35:29.880 --> 35:34.000
A wolf in sheep's clothing.
That is tenuous.

35:34.040 --> 35:37.600
I'm not being funny Wolfe, but this
case has a victim, and it isn't you.

35:37.640 --> 35:41.920
I managed to extract a DNA sample
from the jumper. It's Dale Waite.

35:41.960 --> 35:45.040
- The bouncer.
- Let's go.
I'll get a unit to his house

35:45.080 --> 35:47.480
- and one to the club.
- Me and the team
will head to the house.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.720
Wolfe, I need you to see this.

35:49.760 --> 35:54.160
Right, so once it became clear that
Sol left Sarah's house alive,

35:54.200 --> 35:57.560
I did another sweep of the car.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.880
See that.
It could be innocent, of course.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.760
Let's find out.

36:12.680 --> 36:17.080
- Whoa.
- Well, that's an arterial spray
if ever I've seen one.

36:17.120 --> 36:20.160
Dale must've murdered him as he
approached the car.

36:20.200 --> 36:23.440
It's an upward angle from a
very low impact point.

36:23.480 --> 36:27.560
What if Sol was on his knees.
Dale came up and hit him from
behind.

36:27.600 --> 36:31.000
He fell down and then Dale followed
up with a knife in the neck.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.400
There was no injury on the back of
Sol's head

36:33.440 --> 36:37.200
- or between his shoulder blades.
- If
you're Dale, why go to the trouble?

36:37.240 --> 36:40.280
He had the knife. He was taller
than Sol, why not plunge it in

36:40.320 --> 36:44.200
and be done with it?
Because he was compensating.

38:08.960 --> 38:13.400
Tyler. You cut
Sol's femoral artery.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.480
I couldn't have reached his carotid.

38:16.520 --> 38:20.520
But you've put yours on a plate.
Don't do something you'll regret.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.720
Why would I regret it?

38:22.760 --> 38:27.480
Everyone's going to know my name.
I think they'll know it now anyway.

38:27.520 --> 38:31.280
No one cares about Sol James.

38:31.320 --> 38:35.520
But Professor Wolfe -
the forensics expert

38:35.560 --> 38:39.600
who got murdered by the guy
he never suspected.

38:39.640 --> 38:42.040
That's a story.

38:42.080 --> 38:45.880
I'm sorry I underestimated you.

38:47.160 --> 38:49.640
I've been underestimated my
whole life.

38:49.680 --> 38:53.000
I struggle to hold a pen,
and some days my piss,

38:53.040 --> 38:56.040
so you can't blame people, really.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.920
But if you've got to be invisible

38:58.960 --> 39:01.880
you might as well have some fun
with it.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.760
I don't think this is about
disability.

39:04.800 --> 39:08.120
I think it's about psychopathy,
pure and simple.

39:08.800 --> 39:11.120
Please, I'm sorry.

39:11.160 --> 39:15.360
I'm sorry, please!
Tyler, put the knife down.

39:18.720 --> 39:21.240
I'm not going to kill you.

39:21.280 --> 39:24.960
I'm going to haunt you.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.200
You're going to spend the rest
of your life

39:28.240 --> 39:32.520
wondering if I killed again in the
time it took you to find me.

39:33.560 --> 39:36.760
I'm the guy you didn't spot, Wolfe.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.720
I'm the guy who won.

39:45.240 --> 39:48.680
Come in.

39:51.800 --> 39:55.240
You wanted me?
Sit down, Dominique.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.920
Would you mind telling me why you
ordered these files

40:06.960 --> 40:09.280
from the evidence archive?

40:09.320 --> 40:12.800
You can learn a lot by studying
old cases.

40:12.840 --> 40:16.520
I agree. So tell me why you
felt the need

40:16.560 --> 40:19.080
to use a fake name to get them.
And tell me also why

40:19.120 --> 40:21.800
you chose these
files in particular.

40:21.840 --> 40:24.280
No reason.

40:24.320 --> 40:28.000
Seems you had a good look
through while I was out yesterday.

40:28.040 --> 40:31.480
All cases that involved the death
of an infant.

40:32.840 --> 40:35.240
Why?

40:36.760 --> 40:39.560
You flicked through all of them.

40:39.600 --> 40:42.760
But you were really interested
in this one -

40:42.800 --> 40:45.960
Regina versus Barnette.

40:48.240 --> 40:51.080
I'm assuming it's no coincidence
that you share a surname

40:51.120 --> 40:53.920
with the defendant in this case.

40:57.520 --> 41:00.240
Fay Barnette is my mum.

41:01.480 --> 41:04.360
The baby who died was my brother.

41:04.400 --> 41:07.720
And your evidence is the
reason she's been banged up

41:07.760 --> 41:10.520
for the best part of my life.
So that's why you're here?

41:10.560 --> 41:13.400
To access this case file.
To undermine me.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.720
It's one of the reasons I'm here.
Of all the calculating

41:16.760 --> 41:19.760
and underhand things I've ever
heard-If you're going to sack me,

41:19.800 --> 41:22.200
just sack me.
You don't get it, do you?

41:22.240 --> 41:25.440
Your position on this team
is bigger than you.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.640
When you screw up, you do it on
behalf of a whole community.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.840
What, because I'm black?

41:30.880 --> 41:35.080
When is a white person ever asked to
- represent their race?
- Life's unfair.

41:35.120 --> 41:38.920
You know what, Wolfe?
You're a hypocrite.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.680
You weren't worried about
discrediting black people

41:41.720 --> 41:44.640
when you were making biological
- weapons.
- Those were extreme
circumstances.

41:44.680 --> 41:47.040
That's the thing about laws, you
don't get to decide

41:47.080 --> 41:50.280
- when you can break them.
- Clear your
desk, Dominique. We're done.

41:50.320 --> 41:54.360
No, Professor Kinteh.
We're far from done.

41:57.240 --> 42:01.360
If there's one thing you've taught
me, it's that evidence wins.

42:03.120 --> 42:08.240
I'm used to prisons.
Maybe I'll come and visit you.

42:25.520 --> 42:28.960
I can't believe I'm doing this.
She spent an hour in the STI clinic,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.560
- not a month in the Priory.
- It isn't
about the STI clinic. It's about

42:32.600 --> 42:35.560
trauma and loss and how we support
each other through it.

42:35.600 --> 42:40.560
You and I are both fully aware that
Jeff was... A cheating ball sack.

42:40.600 --> 42:44.120
A cheating ball sack. But your
mother saw something in him

42:44.160 --> 42:47.040
that she connected with and that
connection has been ruptured.

42:47.080 --> 42:49.360
So you're chucking me out cos
you feel sorry for her.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.080
- But we can't tell her that.
- It's not
just that she needs you, Flick.

42:52.120 --> 42:54.720
She needs you to need her. Which is
why you're going to tell her

42:54.760 --> 42:57.760
that living at Dad's is exactly
the domestic void

42:57.800 --> 43:00.760
she might have imagined,
but more than that...

43:00.800 --> 43:03.080
I missed my mum.
Exactly.

43:03.120 --> 43:06.520
You are topping up my phone credit
for the next six months.

43:06.560 --> 43:09.200
We said three.

43:09.240 --> 43:12.920
You're gonna be OK?
Of course, why wouldn't I be?
