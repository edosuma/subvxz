WEBVTT

00:05.272 --> 00:07.339
(sirens wailing)

00:07.675 --> 00:09.575
29 to base.
Exited Mission,

00:09.577 --> 00:11.243
heading eastbound on Douglas.
Possible DUI.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.478
Requesting backup.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.679
DISPATCH:
Copy that.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.114
(tires squealing)

00:23.491 --> 00:25.591
OFFICER:
Driver fled. Heading west.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.493
Front seat passenger remains
in vehicle.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.228
OFFICER 2:
37-1, right behind you.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.662
In pursuit of driver.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.566
What do we got?

00:34.568 --> 00:36.635
OFFICER: Failed to stop
at a Border Patrol checkpoint.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.071
Driver bailed,
passenger may be injured.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.573
Passenger!
Let me see your hands!

00:41.575 --> 00:43.108
(distant shouting)

00:44.345 --> 00:45.644
Open your eyes.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.312
<i> Abre los ojos.</i>

00:48.649 --> 00:50.349
MVC victim.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.084
Requesting corpsmen
and transport to base hospital.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.185
Wake up, amigo.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.787
<i> Despiértate.</i>
Careful.

00:54.789 --> 00:56.455
There's a nose bleed.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.691
Sure as hell
doesn't look like blood.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.451
Morning!

01:25.453 --> 01:27.319
Are we hiding
from Wile E. Coyote again?

01:27.321 --> 01:28.854
This is a horticulture
makeover for the office,

01:28.856 --> 01:30.355
I'll have you know.

01:30.357 --> 01:31.490
Oh, yeah, what's wrong
with our ficus?

01:31.492 --> 01:32.758
Uh, we're in a drought.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.360
The snow pack is at 18%.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.628
The reservoirs are almost dry,

01:36.630 --> 01:38.330
and this little guy only takes

01:38.332 --> 01:39.565
one sip of water a month,

01:39.567 --> 01:42.568
in contrast to those
water-guzzling "fi-kai."

01:42.570 --> 01:44.603
Why'd they drain the fountain?

01:44.605 --> 01:48.273
Oh, that leaky sieve was
costing us ten gallons a day.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.576
Hey, who didn't flush
the toilet?

01:50.578 --> 01:52.211
Oh, yeah, don't look at me.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.246
I was supposed to put these up
into the bathrooms.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.547
I was gonna hang
them up there.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.149
I just hadn't
gotten to it yet.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.183
Here you are, sir.

01:58.185 --> 02:00.319
"In this land of fun and sun,

02:00.321 --> 02:01.820
we don't flush for number one"?

02:01.822 --> 02:04.323
What?
It's a clever reminder
that saves

02:04.325 --> 02:06.258
two gallons every single time.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.160
That sounds a little unsanitary.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.195
(scoffs)
It's not gonna happen.

02:10.197 --> 02:11.396
What are you talking about?

02:11.398 --> 02:12.764
That's 5,000 gallons a year.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.500
These are critical times,

02:14.502 --> 02:15.767
and critical times call for...

02:15.769 --> 02:16.768
(screams)

02:16.770 --> 02:19.171
What? Cactus karma.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.540
Oh, no, a little
help here, please?

02:21.542 --> 02:22.808
Get it out,
take it out right now.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.309
Just pull it out.
No, no, not so fast.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.845
You just pull it out,
it'll leave barbs inside.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.302
Yeah, you know what,
Sam's right.

02:28.303 --> 02:29.758
You might want
to Google that first.

02:29.759 --> 02:31.214
Look on the bright side.
At least you weren't facing it.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.351
(rattling)

02:33.587 --> 02:36.588
Aztec rain stick
to bring forth a storm.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.357
All are summoned.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.525
Case on deck, sorry.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.759
Just real quick,
Callen, could you just...

02:40.761 --> 02:43.162
Gotta go.
Uh, can you just grab...

02:43.164 --> 02:45.831
I don't want... Sam?
Duty calls.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.000
(sirens wailing)

02:48.001 --> 02:50.168
This is a Border Patrol pursuit
in Oceanside.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.270
Camp Pendleton.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.404
Southern border.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.672
Undocumented immigrant?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.374
Drug runner?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.242
Neither of those
would make it our case.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.344
The driver escaped, but the
passenger is currently in ICU

02:59.346 --> 03:00.746
at the Naval hospital.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.848
What type of injuries?
GRANGER:
No injuries.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.817
Severe infection
with the bacteria anthrax.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.252
That's extremely fatal.

03:07.254 --> 03:09.188
Any other cases?

03:09.190 --> 03:10.455
Not a one.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.324
So how did this guy contract it?

03:12.326 --> 03:13.592
Well, anthrax occurs naturally

03:13.594 --> 03:15.727
in cattle, sheep,
goats and horses.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.296
GRANGER:
All very interesting,

03:17.298 --> 03:18.630
but we need to assume the worst.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.965
Bioterrorism attack.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.434
Precisely.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.803
And against
the Marine's home base.

03:24.805 --> 03:28.307
Quite a publicity coup
for the terrorists.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.775
Look, a rogue PhD in
a modest lab

03:29.777 --> 03:32.311
could produce
weapons-grade anthrax.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.812
Mexico's a big country.
That's perfect.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.915
We'll start in Cabo,
make our way over to Cancún.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.785
Mr. Deeks and Ms. Blye
will cover the hospital.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.554
Mr. C and Mr. H will
head south of the border.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.722
DEEKS:
Come on, not again.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.856
Hetty, I know Mexico.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.858
I've surfed every corner
of that country.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.327
Oh.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.362
So have I.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.763
(laughter)

03:51.765 --> 03:52.831
GRANGER:
All right,

03:52.833 --> 03:54.800
Callen and Sam
will be undercover

03:54.802 --> 03:56.835
as furniture importers.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.937
Mexican customs, tax codes.

03:58.939 --> 04:02.441
You'll be dropped in Tijuana.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.810
Our NCIS country<i> referrent</i>

04:04.812 --> 04:06.245
will be your guide.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.579
Agent Fuentes.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.448
We have agents in Mexico?

04:09.450 --> 04:10.716
Yeah, they, uh,
do safety briefings

04:10.718 --> 04:11.850
for ships in port,

04:11.852 --> 04:13.485
and if local sailors
get in trouble,

04:13.487 --> 04:14.820
they investigate the crimes.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.138
The hospital will be good
for you, Deeks.

04:16.139 --> 04:17.455
Might want to have them
check out your, uh...

04:17.458 --> 04:18.790
(screams)

04:18.792 --> 04:19.891
Morgan Freeman!
Yikes.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.293
Or not.
Ow.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.995
It's huge.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.600
He's in a coma.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.269
Intubated on a ventilator.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.304
Can't talk, can't even
communicate with pen and paper.

04:32.306 --> 04:33.839
Did you find a wallet or I.D.?

04:33.841 --> 04:35.774
Nothing; right now,
he's a John Doe.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.644
Whoa, don't we need, uh,
gloves or masks or something?

04:38.646 --> 04:40.846
He's been decontaminated.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.047
There's never been a case
of human-to-human transmission.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.917
The anthrax can't jump
out of the body.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.386
Good to know.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.954
Mm-hmm.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.939
Any signs of improvement?

04:50.940 --> 04:52.923
He's getting
three powerful antimicrobials,

04:52.926 --> 04:55.460
but even if we kill
all the bacteria,

04:55.462 --> 04:57.696
the anthrax has already given
off a toxin that can destroy

04:57.698 --> 04:58.930
every cell in his body.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.932
That's not very encouraging.
With the most

05:00.934 --> 05:03.568
aggressive therapy,
it's still 50% fatal.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.804
Inside of his left arm,
did you guys write that?

05:07.741 --> 05:09.708
He had that when he arrived.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.378
4914 cc.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.781
A cc is a cubic centimeter.

05:15.783 --> 05:19.017
4,900 cc's,
that's almost five liters.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.986
Five liters of what?

05:20.988 --> 05:23.305
That could be anthrax.

05:23.306 --> 05:25.623
That would be enough to take out
most of Southern California.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.038
You know the part I don't like?

05:40.040 --> 05:43.775
Avoiding Montezuma's revenge?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.711
Being unarmed.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.630
You know the drill.

05:47.631 --> 05:49.548
You're caught trying to cross
the border with a weapon,

05:49.550 --> 05:51.450
ten years in a Mexican prison.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.851
You'd never survive.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.620
I suppose you would?

05:55.622 --> 05:57.022
Down here,
they don't feed you in jail.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.924
You're friends and family have
to bring you your meals.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.659
Me, I'd have a line a mile long.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.394
You,

06:02.396 --> 06:04.029
unless Jo drives down here
every day,

06:04.031 --> 06:05.697
you'd starve to death.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.966
All this time, I thought we were
more than just partners.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.768
Nah, I'd take up a collection.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.069
Send you a Happy Meal
every now and then.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.321
Appreciate that.
Hey, fellas.

06:12.322 --> 06:13.572
Let me know if you
need a taxi later.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.640
<i>Gracias.</i>
Sure thing.

06:16.810 --> 06:17.909
(pounding on door)

06:17.911 --> 06:19.978
CALLEN:
Agent Fuentes.

06:21.882 --> 06:22.881
Hello?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.549
Hello?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.585
It's definitely
the right room.
Maybe we're early.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.389
I got him, run, run!

06:30.391 --> 06:32.023
Stop!

06:32.025 --> 06:33.392
Easy, Mauricio.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.960
They're on my team.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.729
Agent Fuentes?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.398
Paola.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.433
Our country<i> referrent?</i>
Sorry, yeah.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.935
I forgot to tell him
you were coming.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.837
Welcome to Mexico.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.886
So, what's the duty tax
on an armoire?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.053
Ha, ha...
Trick question.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.922
There's no tax under NAFTA,

07:03.924 --> 07:05.123
but there's
a processing fee of...

07:05.125 --> 07:07.025
BOTH:
.3464%

07:07.027 --> 07:09.060
I like that!
Ah!

07:10.497 --> 07:11.763
Where's Mauricio?

07:11.765 --> 07:13.598
He had to go.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.933
He your bodyguard?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.168
Criminal informant.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.103
He's a cartel driver
with a taxi service

07:18.105 --> 07:19.104
on the side.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.672
Trust him?

07:20.674 --> 07:22.607
Ten years ago, his fiancée died.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.210
Random victim
of cartel violence.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.512
That should make him motivated.
Mm-hmm.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.848
He's always been there for me.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.017
We think an Islamic group

07:32.019 --> 07:33.985
is working on biological agents.

07:33.987 --> 07:37.055
Last week,
Mauricio drove cartel capos

07:37.057 --> 07:40.692
to a cash drop
from a Middle-Eastern man.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.527
Who's the guy?

07:42.529 --> 07:43.895
Always in shadows.

07:43.897 --> 07:47.499
There's no big demand
for cocaine in terror cells.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.568
Well, he could be using
the cartel's expertise

07:49.570 --> 07:51.002
to get bioweapons
into the States.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.170
Public Health reported

07:52.172 --> 07:53.972
an anthrax hit

07:53.974 --> 07:56.007
on a sensor by the airport.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.577
If they have a covert lab there
making anthrax,

07:58.579 --> 08:00.579
that's a lot of real estate.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.081
Sounds like a good place
for a furniture warehouse.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.950
No, no, no, change of plans.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.953
Furniture importers
are sedentary.

08:07.955 --> 08:10.222
You two need to be mobile.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.561
"Fast Gringos"?

08:16.563 --> 08:17.929
Seriously?

08:17.931 --> 08:20.131
After we just memorized
all those tax codes?

08:20.133 --> 08:22.701
You guys can cook, right?

08:26.039 --> 08:28.507
Okay, now, update from the CDC

08:28.509 --> 08:30.275
is that it's the Ames
strain of anthrax,

08:30.277 --> 08:31.643
the most deadly.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.079
NELL: In nature,
anthrax spores clump up,

08:34.081 --> 08:36.281
forming a harmless mass
of spores.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.917
Which can neither float
nor penetrate into the lungs.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.151
But if you have
a million-dollar lab,

08:40.153 --> 08:41.286
you coat each individual spore

08:41.288 --> 08:42.954
with silicon.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.623
Those spores then fly
and penetrate

08:44.624 --> 08:46.291
deep inside the lung,
causing fatal disease.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.659
ERIC:
Your guy was infected

08:47.661 --> 08:49.895
with floating clumps
of five spores,

08:49.897 --> 08:52.864
uh, coated with an anti-caking
agent called bentonite.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.733
And how would you make that?

08:54.735 --> 08:56.167
All you need's
a tabletop lyophilizer.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.302
We've notified
Callen and Sam.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.004
Great, all right,
what do we have

08:59.006 --> 09:00.138
on the pickup that crashed?

09:00.140 --> 09:01.706
It was stolen two days ago

09:01.708 --> 09:03.174
from a Santiago Perez

09:03.176 --> 09:05.076
in East L.A.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.912
FBI and Homeland Security
have interviewed Mr. Perez,

09:06.914 --> 09:09.915
but there's no fingerprints
or video from the car heist.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.816
Great. This case is just
full of dead ends.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.919
Yeah, maybe not.
Will you zoom in on that address

09:13.921 --> 09:15.587
on the license?

09:15.589 --> 09:17.856
ERIC:
5113 Cesar Chavez Avenue.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.658
That's two blocks away.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.992
Two blocks away from what?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.377
Number on his arm.

09:22.378 --> 09:23.761
The photo I sent
from the hospital, pull that up.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.231
I mean, that could
be an address.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.567
4914 Cesar Chavez Avenue.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.735
That's two blocks away
from where the truck was stolen.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.771
To the Batmobile.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.839
(truck beeping)

09:36.243 --> 09:38.310
Two more burgers
on the grill, G.

09:41.682 --> 09:42.747
Ah.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.885
<i> Gracias.</i>

09:46.887 --> 09:49.087
Five vacant warehouses.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.323
We can check them out
after the lunch rush.

09:51.325 --> 09:53.024
What the hell's this?

09:53.026 --> 09:55.193
I went to Costco,
picked up some veggie burgers.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.328
A whole case.

09:56.330 --> 09:59.130
Some people enjoy a
healthy alternative.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.198
Really?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.100
Absolutely.
You do realize

10:02.102 --> 10:04.803
you're in Tijuana,
not Malibu, right?

10:06.607 --> 10:08.273
Good luck with that.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.849
What the hell are you doing?

10:17.851 --> 10:19.818
Cooks faster this way.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.252
You're destroying the meat.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.254
Hey, it says fast food
on our truck, all right?

10:23.256 --> 10:24.255
Yeah, but you're squeezing
all the juice out.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.390
The juice equals the flavor.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.659
Move out of the way;
I'll man the grill, G.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.060
Now it's gonna taste
like leather.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.062
Hey, be my guest,
George Foreman, all right?
Come on.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.330
Keep it up,

10:32.332 --> 10:34.366
I'll deep fry your taquitos.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.673
Can I see your business license?

10:41.675 --> 10:43.308
And your, uh,
<i> Isesalud?</i>

10:43.310 --> 10:44.709
Yep. Public health permit.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.411
We got that right here.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.382
Oh,<i> amigo...</i>

10:50.384 --> 10:52.150
this one says December.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.185
You need to renew
it every month.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.321
We can take care of that.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.858
I need to shut you down.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.726
Unless you can pay the fine.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.294
Three hundred dollars.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.201
I work for Public Health.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.405
Your permit...
doesn't need renewal.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.443
CALLEN:
Perhaps we could, uh,

11:18.445 --> 11:21.112
make a little donation

11:21.114 --> 11:22.280
to the police
charity fund.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.683
<i> Gracias.</i>

11:24.685 --> 11:27.252
Have a nice day.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.289
Thank you.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.124
Not all cops are dirty.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.093
Yeah, we'll keep
that in mind.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.995
What's up with all
the assault rifles?

11:38.398 --> 11:41.399
Ah. Private security.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.434
(chuckles)

11:42.436 --> 11:44.369
This isn't San Diego.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.104
You might want to hire
some protection.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.244
What are you guys
doing over there?

11:53.246 --> 11:55.180
Air quality sensors.

11:55.182 --> 11:58.249
So, got any veggie burgers?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.153
As a matter of
fact, we do.
Great.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.155
I'll take two.

12:07.794 --> 12:10.128
You're, uh...
you're a vegetarian?

12:10.130 --> 12:11.129
GONZALEZ:
Hey.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.398
Those cheeseburgers...

12:13.400 --> 12:15.066
will kill you, man.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.901
I'll slow-cook 'em.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.169
It's better for the flavor.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.871
<i> Gracias.</i>

12:19.873 --> 12:21.372
NELL:
Hey, Kens, we're sending you

12:21.374 --> 12:24.509
an expired drivers license
for one Alejandro Guzman.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.445
He's a plumber currently renting
number 4914.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.247
A pretty decent
match for the guy

12:29.249 --> 12:30.515
who crashed and
ran at Pendleton.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.484
And he was formerly deported.

12:32.486 --> 12:33.852
All right, we're on it.
Thanks.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.289
Check it out.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.157
It's the same guy that's loading
his truck across the street.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.809
Wow, fantastic.

12:40.810 --> 12:42.460
Maybe he can get us a discount
on low-flow shower heads.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.962
(chuckles)
You know
showers account for

12:43.964 --> 12:45.930
1.2 trillion gallons
of water a year?

12:45.932 --> 12:48.433
Maybe he can get us
a low-flow fixture
for your mouth.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.902
Maybe he can get us
a water softener
for your attitude.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.237
(laughing):
Oh, touché!

12:52.239 --> 12:54.405
Uh, excuse me, sir?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.407
I am so sorry to bother you,
but could you help us?

12:56.409 --> 12:58.777
Uh, my kitchen sink is clogged

12:58.779 --> 13:00.812
and my boyfriend
is kind of useless, so...

13:00.814 --> 13:01.880
Wow.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.453
Oh, come on,
we live next to Mr. Perez.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.989
You know that his, uh, truck
got jacked two nights ago?

13:10.991 --> 13:14.526
Yeah, they found it
crashed down in, uh, Oceanside.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.828
KENSI:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:16.830 --> 13:17.796
DEEKS:
Really?!

13:17.798 --> 13:19.230
KENSI:
Federal agents!

13:21.101 --> 13:23.835
I gotta be honest, I'm not
happy with you, Alejandro.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.003
I think I pulled
a hamstring,

13:25.005 --> 13:26.171
I definitely stained
my jeans, and what?

13:26.173 --> 13:27.539
Over a few simple questions?

13:27.541 --> 13:29.374
Were you driving Perez's truck?

13:30.977 --> 13:32.510
Who was in the front seat?
You know what?

13:32.512 --> 13:34.445
Why don't we start off
with an easy one, huh?

13:34.447 --> 13:35.814
(groans)

13:35.816 --> 13:37.515
So my toilet's running.
Yeah.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.883
Even after I exchanged
that little flapper thing

13:38.885 --> 13:40.485
at the bottom of the tank.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.086
So what the heck
am I supposed to do now?

13:46.560 --> 13:49.227
So last night, after midnight,
what are you doing?

13:49.229 --> 13:50.228
Are you asleep?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.596
Huh?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.565
You watching TV?

13:53.567 --> 13:56.568
You shampooing your poodle?

13:58.305 --> 14:00.505
No English.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.042
<i> Bueno. </i>
DEEKS:
Hmm.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.990
I was in my bed.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.592
Wow, look at that.
It's like a miracle.

14:20.594 --> 14:22.927
Like, his English is back
and it's perfect.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.395
Must've been a concussion.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.098
Yeah, I can see
the scrape on his head.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.166
How'd that happen?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.301
I work under houses.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.970
I hit a pipe.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.540
There was blood
on the steering wheel.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.610
We're just waiting
for a DNA match.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.249
Do I need a lawyer?

14:44.251 --> 14:47.418
Uh, do we know any lawyers
that represent terrorists?

14:47.420 --> 14:48.486
Mmm.

14:48.488 --> 14:49.554
Terrorists?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.089
Yeah, yeah.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.892
Your passenger was
infected with anthrax.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.660
What is that?

14:55.662 --> 14:59.330
Anthrax is a biological weapon.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.399
Did you two
work together?

15:03.136 --> 15:06.170
I picked him up hitch-hiking.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.006
Oh, so you<i> were </i>
driving the truck.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.675
Ah.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.144
He's probably going to die.

15:17.651 --> 15:22.186
(sighs)

15:22.188 --> 15:26.090
The man in the hospital...

15:26.092 --> 15:28.159
his name is Livio Guzman.

15:31.298 --> 15:34.032
He's my son.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.017
Hey, guys, just curious...

15:53.019 --> 15:55.987
Is there any precipitation
down there?

15:55.989 --> 15:57.522
A little.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.257
Huh.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.558
You can thank the rain stick.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.560
So,

16:02.561 --> 16:04.561
after searching all
Middle Eastern microbiologists

16:04.564 --> 16:06.130
working in Mexico,

16:06.132 --> 16:07.565
we have a person
of interest.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.434
ERIC:
Fuad Naziri, Ph.D.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.170
NELL:
He works for Eliminado.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.504
It's a San Diego
pesticide firm

16:13.506 --> 16:15.473
with a production
facility in Tijuana.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.075
Where can we find him?

16:17.077 --> 16:18.576
ERIC:
Hmm.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.345
Lunch every day
at the same café.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.615
(lively Mexican music playing)

16:38.398 --> 16:40.298
That's a San Diego magazine.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.767
You American?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.469
How about that?

16:44.471 --> 16:45.670
We're from L.A.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.405
Yeah, we got
a food truck.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.507
You tired of tacos?
You ought to check us out.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.010
SAM:
Fast Gringos.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.611
You don't look like
you're on vacation.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.113
I work here.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.714
Uh, pesticide research.

16:56.716 --> 16:57.782
Like a scientist?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.517
This is gonna
sound strange,

16:59.519 --> 17:01.519
but do you know anything
about anthrax?

17:02.622 --> 17:05.023
Why would you ask that?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.157
We work in an industrial park.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.525
and there's rumors
of a case there.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.461
You think we're safe?

17:09.462 --> 17:11.396
I don't know anything
about anthrax.

17:11.398 --> 17:14.499
My work is with
Mexican fruit fly eradication.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.601
Sorry, but I'm due back
at the office.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.703
Hey, maybe we can
grab some beers sometime.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.605
Start a ex-pat business club.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.473
Yeah.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.626
Don't be foolish.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.778
Down here, you do not congregate
with groups of Americans.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.679
It's a dangerous place.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.583
Have a nice day.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.721
Hey, I got his tail.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.457
You got a huge line at
the food truck, though.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.325
Man, I've been talking
that thing up.

17:41.327 --> 17:42.560
(Sam chuckles)

17:42.562 --> 17:44.162
That's really not necessary.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.696
I'm like your VP
of marketing, man.

17:45.698 --> 17:46.798
You should seriously think

17:46.800 --> 17:48.466
about giving me
a raise, you know?

17:48.468 --> 17:50.535
Stock options, or like
a golden parachute...

17:50.537 --> 17:52.603
Something, you know?

17:55.341 --> 17:57.141
CALLEN:
Naziri's definitely
got the know-how

17:57.143 --> 17:58.810
to weaponize anthrax.

17:58.812 --> 18:01.813
His pesticide company
could support aerial spraying.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.317
He's on a short leash
with Mauricio.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.086
Let's move the
food truck back.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.154
Work the dinner
crowd at Eliminado.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.364
Livio is the night janitor

18:20.366 --> 18:22.500
for some warehouses in Tijuana.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.534
When did he get sick?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.369
ALEJANDRO:
A week ago.

18:25.371 --> 18:28.106
He got antibiotics
at the<i> farmacia,</i>

18:28.108 --> 18:30.174
but it got really bad.

18:30.176 --> 18:32.677
I wanted him up here.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.378
How did he cross the border?

18:34.380 --> 18:35.379
Where he worked,

18:35.381 --> 18:36.814
he knew about a drug tunnel.

18:36.816 --> 18:40.418
They're extremely
dangerous, though.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.386
Cartels,
they use them for drugs.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.723
Never for immigrants,
'cause someone could give it up.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.692
Where did you meet him?

18:47.694 --> 18:49.861
Otay Mesa.

18:49.863 --> 18:52.230
I was trying to get him
to the county hospital,

18:52.232 --> 18:55.166
near my house.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.435
How did he get so sick?

18:57.437 --> 18:59.737
Well, best guess is
somebody's prepping anthrax

18:59.739 --> 19:01.572
in one of his warehouses.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.875
I have a grandson,
a daughter-in-law.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.910
They... they used
to bring him dinner.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.579
She's not answering her cell.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.214
You think they're sick, too?

19:10.216 --> 19:11.616
Well, I hate to say it,

19:11.618 --> 19:13.351
but anything's possible,
Alejandro.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.855
We need you to show us where
the tunnel exit is in San Diego.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.660
If you take me to my family.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.761
In Mexico?

19:23.763 --> 19:25.296
DEEKS:
Mm-mm.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.631
There's no way.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.267
It's fair.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.836
I'll give you the drug tunnel...

19:31.838 --> 19:35.373
you give me my family.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.309
I really want to help this guy,

19:38.311 --> 19:39.777
but I don't want to risk...
There's Arabic chatter.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.280
Anthrax is on the move
today or tomorrow.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.748
KENSI: Okay, so we cut
this guy a deal.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.416
And we shut down
the tunnel.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.751
That's easier
said then done.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.187
By the time we mobilize
a task force

19:49.189 --> 19:50.821
with Homeland Security
and Border Patrol,

19:50.823 --> 19:52.490
it might be too late.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.624
Oh...

19:57.697 --> 19:59.497
We can handle this.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.566
Granger...

20:03.570 --> 20:04.769
We bring the father,

20:04.771 --> 20:07.438
secure the tunnel exit
and we wait.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.307
That's it.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.509
We should bring
a few flashlights

20:11.511 --> 20:13.344
just in case,
though, right?

20:14.948 --> 20:16.097
All right.

20:16.098 --> 20:17.247
There you go,
<i> amigo.</i>
<i>Gracias.</i>

20:17.250 --> 20:19.784
Veggie burger on wheat.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.285
The last one.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.753
We gotta restock.

20:22.755 --> 20:23.955
You gotta move, too.

20:23.957 --> 20:25.289
You're staking out
the wrong spot.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.225
What, did you get bad intel?

20:27.227 --> 20:28.693
The public health report

20:28.695 --> 20:30.828
gave us the wrong address
for the anthrax.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.863
Wrong address? Why would they?

20:32.865 --> 20:34.599
Mexican authorities
might not want

20:34.601 --> 20:36.601
the U.S. taking credit
for the investigation.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.369
They want to
seem capable.
Yeah.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.906
New address is on the back.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.374
It's another
industrial park,

20:43.376 --> 20:45.810
and it's also
where Naziri works.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.011
We're on the move.

21:00.526 --> 21:02.260
Make a right at the corner.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.628
Got it.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.300
It's four miles to the...

21:09.302 --> 21:10.434
(engine revving)

21:10.436 --> 21:11.602
Wait, slow down, caballero.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.271
Can't.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.440
Accelerator's stuck.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.044
(chuckles) Stay calm,
put it in neutral.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.612
I'm in neutral.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.947
Well, hit the brake!

21:22.949 --> 21:25.316
Brake's not working.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.017
I'll turn off the ignition.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.055
Hold on!

21:31.057 --> 21:32.923
(tires squealing)

21:37.330 --> 21:38.329
Move your legs, all the way.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.397
You don't want
to be down there.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.598
Yeah, you got better ideas?

21:40.600 --> 21:42.033
CALLEN:
<i> Turning.</i>

21:47.640 --> 21:49.440
Get out of there, Sam.
I see it, just a minute.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.676
We don't have a minute-- get up!

21:52.979 --> 21:54.045
Sam?!

21:55.415 --> 21:56.480
(tires screeching)

22:03.990 --> 22:05.589
Well...

22:05.591 --> 22:07.992
think they're on to us?

22:07.994 --> 22:12.029
Either that, or the taco carts
don't like the competition.

22:13.366 --> 22:15.433
DEEKS:
<i> One, two, three.</i>

22:22.108 --> 22:23.541
All right...

22:23.543 --> 22:24.775
we got electricity.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.110
And ventilation.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.111
KENSI:
Tunnel rat.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.045
DEEKS: And they're
on the move.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.413
Wait for backup?

22:29.415 --> 22:30.915
Yeah, that would
be prudent.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.750
Yeah, but we got great odds--
three on one, let's do this.

22:32.752 --> 22:33.751
Come on, Granger.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.119
This was not part
of the plan.

22:37.757 --> 22:38.756
All right, go.

22:38.758 --> 22:39.824
All right.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.660
And you stay right here.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.366
This place must have
cost millions.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.101
DEEKS: Yeah, they probably
recouped it in a day.

22:51.604 --> 22:52.937
KENSI: Stop!
Federal agents!

22:52.939 --> 22:54.472
<i> Alta!</i>
Hug the wall!

22:54.474 --> 22:55.639
I'm hugging it.

22:55.641 --> 22:57.074
GRANGER:
Keep it dark!

23:02.115 --> 23:03.114
GRANGER:
Alejandro's down.

23:03.116 --> 23:03.547
Damn it, cover me!

23:08.020 --> 23:10.020
I thought you'd leave
without me.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.123
My grandson...

23:12.125 --> 23:14.008
I have to see him.

23:14.009 --> 23:15.892
GSW upper arm,
through and through.

23:15.895 --> 23:16.961
(gunfire continuing)
Control the bleeding!

23:16.963 --> 23:18.496
Control the shooter!

23:31.411 --> 23:34.412
The belt should
stop the bleeding.

23:34.414 --> 23:35.679
(groans)

23:35.681 --> 23:36.814
DEEKS:
Approaching.

23:36.816 --> 23:37.915
KENSI:
It's us.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.150
Did you get him?

23:39.152 --> 23:41.018
Uh, yeah, I winged him.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.787
He got away.

23:42.789 --> 23:43.921
How's he doing?

23:43.923 --> 23:46.123
It's arterial--
he'll need a hospital.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.992
I'm okay.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.160
I want to stay with you.

23:49.162 --> 23:51.462
You could lose this arm, sir.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.798
My son is dying.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.567
Without my grandson,
I have nothing.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.968
Please.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.871
We'll take care of him.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.907
I promise you.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.911
All right, let's get you
to the hospital.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.446
(groans)

24:09.916 --> 24:11.115
Careful.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.621
All right, where do you want us?

24:17.623 --> 24:19.924
Right where you are.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.992
Don't do anything stupid.

24:28.868 --> 24:32.069
All right, how far
do you think it is to Mexico?

24:32.071 --> 24:33.938
Hundred yards, tops.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.806
If this leads
to the anthrax lab,

24:35.808 --> 24:38.042
we will shut it down,
we will secure it.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.977
Well, that doesn't sound stupid,
it sounds smart.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.080
Shall we?
We shall.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.790
DEEKS:
See that?

24:52.792 --> 24:53.858
KENSI:
Mm-hmm.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.899
I told you I winged him.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.068
No pulse.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.271
Move forward with caution?

25:07.273 --> 25:10.274
And if we see anything weird,
we just put it in reverse.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.842
Not stupid at all.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.855
Got a ladder.

25:24.857 --> 25:25.923
<i> Bienvenidos a México.</i>

25:26.859 --> 25:27.958
Mm-hmm.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.098
Who's going up?

25:34.100 --> 25:36.100
We should probably
"rock-paper-scissors" for it.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.034
West coast rules?

25:37.036 --> 25:38.068
Let's do it.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.037
On three.
Okay.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.739
BOTH:
One, two, three.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.707
Rock beats scissors--
you're going up.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.876
Wh-What? N-No.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.044
No, the winner stays,
the loser goes.
Who came up
with that rule?

25:48.047 --> 25:50.047
I think it's pretty obvious,
'cause the winner lives

25:50.049 --> 25:51.982
and the loser faces
certain death.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.183
Fine.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.585
I go up.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.203
You're such a gentleman.

25:56.204 --> 25:57.820
No, all right,
I got it, I got it...
Hey, whoa!

25:57.823 --> 25:59.156
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.225
This is why you should
never fall in love.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.627
Aw, don't worry,

26:03.629 --> 26:05.696
they probably fled
when they heard the gunshots.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.031
Or maybe they're
waiting right there

26:07.033 --> 26:09.099
with a bunch of AKs
pointed at my head.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.105
I don't see any feet.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.341
Looks like some sort
of storage room.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.581
Uh-oh.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.152
Hey, Kens,
we got another body.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.127
DEEKS:
<i> Soplón?</i>

26:37.129 --> 26:38.662
KENSI:
Means "blow."

26:38.664 --> 26:39.930
He was a whistle-blower,

26:39.931 --> 26:41.197
it means he snitched
on the cartels.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.868
Can we take a picture of
that and send it to ops?

26:44.870 --> 26:46.737
Yeah.
(camera on phone clicks)

26:46.739 --> 26:48.072
(phone ringing)

26:48.074 --> 26:50.874
Well, hello, there,
we lost you for half an hour.

26:50.876 --> 26:52.876
That's 'cause we were
underground in a drug tunnel.

26:52.878 --> 26:54.211
We're up now.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.813
ERIC:
Now I got you on GPS.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.214
In Tijuana.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.283
And you are a stone's throw
from Callen and Sam.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.051
Three warehouses to the west.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.252
Awesome, thank you,
on our way.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.926
CALLEN: This is the only vacant
warehouse near the anthrax hit.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.365
You got an image?

27:14.367 --> 27:16.367
Looks good.

27:16.369 --> 27:18.302
And not too vacant.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.237
(cell phone chimes)

27:20.239 --> 27:22.306
Kensi and Deeks are
in the neighborhood.

27:23.242 --> 27:26.110
Oh, no.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.144
What?

27:31.217 --> 27:32.816
What?

27:40.960 --> 27:43.093
Oh, Mauricio.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.995
I'm really sorry.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.131
PAOLA:
Oh, God.

27:47.133 --> 27:50.267
I pulled him into this.

27:50.269 --> 27:53.137
He wanted to help us.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.239
We'll see this through.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.174
You need some time?

27:57.176 --> 27:59.309
No.

27:59.311 --> 28:00.911
No, we gotta push through.

28:00.913 --> 28:01.979
You're sure?

28:01.981 --> 28:03.113
Yeah.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.350
All right.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.754
What are we looking at here?

28:10.756 --> 28:12.056
Um...

28:12.058 --> 28:15.059
Well, we got, um...
cell culture incubator,

28:15.061 --> 28:16.727
we got fermenting flask,

28:16.729 --> 28:18.729
and, um, lyophilizer.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.699
Everything we need to make
a first batch of anthrax.

28:21.701 --> 28:22.933
Yeah, looks like
they cooked and bailed.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.301
All right, so when
can we get in?

28:24.303 --> 28:25.769
After the guys
in the moon suits

28:25.771 --> 28:27.237
wipe everything down
with formaldehyde.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.238
KENSI:
Callen.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.741
We got your photo.

28:30.743 --> 28:32.409
SAM: That was a
trusted informant.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.078
Kensi, Deeks,

28:34.080 --> 28:35.412
Special Agent Paolo Fuentes.

28:35.414 --> 28:36.814
He worked with her.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.215
I'm so sorry.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.750
DEEKS:
Sorry.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.218
If Mauricio was made...

28:41.220 --> 28:42.953
It means we're all sitting
in the crosshairs.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.089
How'd you find us?

28:45.091 --> 28:46.757
The infected man's father.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.425
He showed us the tunnel
his son used

28:48.427 --> 28:50.327
to cross the border
into San Diego.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.029
He has family here?
Mm-hmm.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.730
Yeah, he's got a grandson
and a daughter-in-law.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.499
PAOLA: Let's hope
they're still alive.

28:55.501 --> 28:58.302
If the cartel knows
that his son used a drug tunnel,

28:58.304 --> 29:00.187
they're gonna kill him.

29:00.188 --> 29:02.071
Send a message not to mess
with their business.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.741
Did you get an address?

29:03.743 --> 29:05.760
Yeah, all we need is a ride.

29:05.761 --> 29:07.778
Grab the van, take the family
to the consulate.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.247
I'll wait here until the
coroner arrives for Mauricio.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.216
You'll need one of these.

29:12.218 --> 29:13.283
We'll check out
Naziri's warehouse.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.152
See if we can link
it to this lab.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.220
Okay.

29:22.862 --> 29:23.827
CALLEN:
Hello?

29:23.829 --> 29:25.062
Dr. Naziri?

29:34.039 --> 29:35.372
G, body.

29:37.510 --> 29:38.909
It's Naziri.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.846
(sighs)

29:42.848 --> 29:44.848
SAM:
Who wanted him dead?

29:44.850 --> 29:46.383
CALLEN:
Well, take your pick.

29:46.385 --> 29:49.386
Tijuana cartel,
the Sinaloas, the Zetas.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.889
If he's in bed
with those guys...

29:51.891 --> 29:53.924
Or he's just a good guy.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.958
We told him about the anthrax,
and he started poking around.

29:56.896 --> 29:57.895
ERIC:
Callen, Sam.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.930
We found your guy Naziri.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.865
So did we.

30:01.867 --> 30:05.569
He crossed the San Ysidro border
into the U.S. 15 minutes ago.

30:06.872 --> 30:08.405
What are you talking about?

30:08.407 --> 30:09.573
NELL:
As a vetted U.S. citizen,

30:09.575 --> 30:11.809
he went right through
the SENTRI lane.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.477
Yeah, he gets quick clearance
by the border patrol

30:13.479 --> 30:15.813
with his RFID card
that pulls up his photo,

30:15.815 --> 30:17.281
license,
car registration.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.816
SAM:
It's a little weird,

30:18.818 --> 30:20.350
because we're looking
at his dead body.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.121
So who's driving his car?

30:37.336 --> 30:38.402
No.
<i> No, mijo.</i>

30:43.108 --> 30:45.509
He sees bad things every day.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.448
<i>Sí?</i>

30:53.919 --> 30:55.219
Ah.
....Mighty Mouse.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.960
<i>Sí?</i>

31:02.962 --> 31:03.961
Yeah?

31:03.963 --> 31:05.028
(motorcycle approaching)

31:07.566 --> 31:08.932
Deeks.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.068
DEEKS:
Get in the van, now.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.202
Let's go.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.372
We can't outrun
these guys, come on.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.045
DEEKS:
Hold on.

31:27.586 --> 31:28.352
(laughs)

31:28.354 --> 31:30.888
(engine revving)

31:30.890 --> 31:33.423
DEEKS:
Gun. Kens.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.197
How far to the consulate?

31:41.066 --> 31:42.666
Far enough.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.368
(engine starts)

31:56.615 --> 31:59.449
All right, so he's got
Naziri's car and his wallet.

31:59.451 --> 32:02.185
Guy would have to be a dead
ringer to cross the border.

32:02.187 --> 32:04.087
(phone chimes)

32:04.089 --> 32:07.224
NELL: Here's the photo
from the checkpoint.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.293
SAM:
He could pass as Naziri.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.995
Can you erase his
beard and his glasses?

32:11.997 --> 32:13.664
Yeah, no problemo.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.435
It's that guy when
we paid off the cop.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.505
Baja Department of Public
Health-- Gonzalez something.

32:21.507 --> 32:22.823
NELL:
Searching.

32:22.824 --> 32:24.140
Yeah, his first name
started with a "D."

32:24.143 --> 32:25.609
He was working with
the cherry picker,

32:25.611 --> 32:26.944
setting up
the pollution sensors.

32:26.946 --> 32:28.612
ERIC:
I got bingo.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.279
Without the facial hair,
he is Diego Gonzalez,

32:30.282 --> 32:32.983
PhD., microbiologist.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.952
Here's his birth certificate.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.654
So Gonzalez was his
mother's maiden name.

32:37.656 --> 32:40.157
His father's name was Jamal...

32:40.159 --> 32:43.193
an Iraqi chemical engineer.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.661
Who died in 1999.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.563
An industrial accident

32:46.565 --> 32:48.665
at an American plant in Tijuana.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.702
So the death of his father
causes anti-American feelings.

32:51.704 --> 32:54.204
He takes his mom's name
but his dad's faith.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.973
That could explain
the veggie burger.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.274
The hamburger meat
wasn't halal.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.709
And if he worked for
the Health Department,

32:58.711 --> 33:00.978
he would've been in a position
where he could've changed

33:00.980 --> 33:02.612
the report on the location
of the anthrax.

33:02.614 --> 33:05.615
Wants to use the tunnels
to move it, pays the cartel...

33:05.617 --> 33:08.585
When that plan fails,
he uses Naziri as backup.

33:08.587 --> 33:10.253
So he's got the anthrax
across the border,

33:10.255 --> 33:11.421
what's his next move?

33:11.423 --> 33:13.690
NELL: Oh, wow,
here's the missing piece.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.126
Gonzalez recently trained

33:16.128 --> 33:18.362
as a helicopter pilot.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.563
So...

33:19.565 --> 33:21.665
He could use Naziri's I.D.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.568
to access the corporate helipad
outside San Diego.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.737
ERIC:
Guys, Eliminado security cam

33:26.739 --> 33:29.439
shows Naziri's car
at the parking lot.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.141
This is going down now.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.342
We gotta get up there.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.387
SAM:
On scene, Hetty.

33:43.389 --> 33:44.688
The stairway
to the helipad

33:44.690 --> 33:46.156
is on the left.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.692
HETTY: The engines
have just started up.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.762
That helicopter
must not get off the ground.

33:51.764 --> 33:54.164
Five-minute warm-up
before takeoff.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.766
Got any local help
on the way?

33:55.768 --> 33:57.284
GRANGER:
Can't risk it.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.801
First sign of police,
he'll dump that tank

33:58.804 --> 34:01.138
and release the anthrax
into the atmosphere.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.472
You know where
they're headed?

34:02.474 --> 34:05.475
The<i> federales </i>
found aerial photographs

34:05.477 --> 34:08.211
at the Gonzalez apartment
in Tijuana.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.480
ERIC: Naval Amphibious
Base Coronado.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.299
Home of the SEALs.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.117
Probably payback for the guys
who took out Bin Laden.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.486
Coronado should
scramble their F-18s.

34:16.488 --> 34:18.822
Already airborne, Mr. Hanna.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.258
That'll have to be Plan B.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.460
Why are we always Plan A?

34:27.666 --> 34:30.667
SAM: See that? Anthrax tanks
in the chopper and the truck.

34:30.669 --> 34:31.802
CALLEN:
If we puncture them...?

34:31.804 --> 34:33.670
How long can you
hold your breath?

34:33.672 --> 34:35.806
Not as long as you.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.342
SAM:
Federal agents!

34:41.480 --> 34:42.712
(groans)

34:49.188 --> 34:50.787
He's getting it up to speed.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.122
SAM: Can't hit
the internal tanks.

34:52.124 --> 34:53.857
Aim for the tail rotor.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.129
(instruments beeping)

35:00.632 --> 35:02.132
(alarm wailing)

35:03.802 --> 35:05.869
(gunfire)

35:05.871 --> 35:07.871
(engine powers down)

35:18.150 --> 35:19.282
(motor starts)

35:20.719 --> 35:22.586
He's pressurizing the tank.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.788
We wait too long,
he's gonna hose us down.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.690
Not if we hose him first.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.525
Check it out.

35:29.761 --> 35:30.894
(gunfire continues)

35:31.797 --> 35:33.430
We got two bullets.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.764
We got two bad guys.

35:50.349 --> 35:51.815
SAM: Shooter down!

35:54.887 --> 35:56.620
(alarm blaring)

36:22.347 --> 36:25.415
Nice job, Dr. Venkman.

36:26.818 --> 36:31.221
We came, we saw, kicked ass.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.346
<i> Corazon.</i>

37:08.493 --> 37:09.793
DEEKS:
Alejandro, this is

37:09.795 --> 37:11.795
Dr. Church.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.730
Thank you.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.368
Thank you so much.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.012
Doctor, what are the chances?

37:29.014 --> 37:32.682
Well, with a deep coma,
it's hard to tell.

37:32.684 --> 37:35.018
His brain needs time to recover,
and nobody knows

37:35.020 --> 37:36.886
(conversation in distance)
if or when that will happen.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.321
Excuse me.

37:38.323 --> 37:39.539
CALLEN: There were
special circumstances.

37:39.540 --> 37:40.756
GRANGER: Which only
they can authorize.

37:40.759 --> 37:41.925
It's the policy.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.026
SAM: And you agree
with that?

37:43.028 --> 37:44.361
GRANGER:
I didn't say that.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.562
What's going on?

37:45.564 --> 37:48.431
Homeland Security's here.

37:48.433 --> 37:49.966
ICE-- taking Alejandro
into custody.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.402
What?
Wait a minute,
they can't do that.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.770
GRANGER: Reentry of
a returned alien

37:53.772 --> 37:55.772
with aggravated felonies...

37:55.774 --> 37:57.274
Guy's a fugitive.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.509
He's a cooperating defendant.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.511
The guy helped shut down
a drug tunnel, Granger.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.880
Mm-hmm. Which is under
the jurisdiction of the DEA

38:03.882 --> 38:05.682
and the tunnel task force.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.784
There was a limited window
to prevent a bioterrorism attack

38:07.786 --> 38:09.419
that could have
wiped out Coronado.

38:09.421 --> 38:10.987
SAM: They're gonna
put a good guy in jail

38:10.989 --> 38:12.689
to teach us a lesson?

38:12.691 --> 38:14.591
No, they're doing their job.

38:14.592 --> 38:16.492
It was their place, not NCIS,
to cut him a deal.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.894
You got to be kidding me.
They...

38:24.936 --> 38:26.403
What's going on?

38:27.906 --> 38:29.539
Alejandro, we are so sorry.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.541
You said I would be able to...

38:31.543 --> 38:32.909
This is temporary.
We're gonna take care of it.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.544
We just gotta make
a couple phone...

38:34.546 --> 38:36.579
Don't make another promise
you can't keep.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.716
Where's the mother?

38:39.718 --> 38:41.718
Getting a medical exam.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.753
She'll go to detention
with the boy,

38:43.755 --> 38:44.988
and then they'll get returned.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.324
No! They'll...

38:51.897 --> 38:53.930
They'll get killed.

38:56.868 --> 38:59.436
Oh, this is not what you said.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.421
DEEKS: I know, and I'm
gonna take care of it.

39:01.422 --> 39:03.405
This is not what you promised!
I'm gonna take
care of it-- listen...

39:05.477 --> 39:07.744
You're gonna wait with us.
You're gonna wait with us.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.980
We did the best we could.

39:43.982 --> 39:46.883
Did we?

39:46.885 --> 39:49.452
Yeah, I think we did.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.961
Oh, my God.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.798
SAM:
What?

40:01.800 --> 40:04.000
We got a flower
on our cactus.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.772
They have been known to do that.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.540
Yeah, but not this one.

40:10.542 --> 40:14.511
Saguaro only blooms one day
a year, for, like, 24 hours.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.012
You guys, this is weird.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.548
I mean, this is a sign.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.550
Actually...

40:20.552 --> 40:24.020
I'm sorry to burst your bubble,
Mr. Deeks, but this

40:24.022 --> 40:27.857
is a Cardón cactus,
not a Saguaro.

40:27.859 --> 40:29.859
This blooms

40:29.861 --> 40:34.798
every night for three months.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.000
Three months
is a long time.

40:37.002 --> 40:39.803
So is four hours
on the phone to Washington.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.838
Please tell me
you gave ICE an earful.

40:41.840 --> 40:45.642
Homeland Security had every
right to take Alejandro away.

40:45.644 --> 40:48.011
They<i> had</i> a right,
but it doesn't<i> make</i> it right.

40:48.013 --> 40:51.481
I managed to smooth things over
with every agency we offended,

40:51.483 --> 40:54.951
so Alejandro's getting released.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.586
CALLEN:
What, are you serious?

40:56.588 --> 40:57.921
GRANGER: His grandson
and daughter-in-law, too.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.222
You got them released?

40:59.224 --> 41:00.990
SAM:
Good man.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.725
My God, I'm gonna hug you.

41:02.727 --> 41:04.961
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.

41:06.765 --> 41:09.232
You're giving me a hug.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.901
HETTY: This was
an exceptional mission

41:11.903 --> 41:14.070
and deserves a celebration.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.672
Tell me that's tequila.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.807
Aha.
Ah?

41:17.809 --> 41:18.975
You know it had to be.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.944
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

41:21.947 --> 41:25.081
It's an extra<i> añejo.</i>

41:25.083 --> 41:26.783
Come to papa.
Uh-huh.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.518
And we obviously have
a cactus to go with it.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.737
Yes.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.955
This cactus is from
Argentina, not Mexico.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.991
Ah, that's where
I went wrong.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.593
And there's a tale.

41:36.595 --> 41:39.729
Two young lovers
who were forbidden to marry,

41:39.731 --> 41:41.998
so they ran away,
up into the mountains.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Avoiding all drug
tunnels, of course.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.668
(chuckles)

41:45.670 --> 41:50.139
Now, the goddess of the land
took pity on them.

41:50.141 --> 41:55.078
She changed the young man
into a giant cactus,

41:55.080 --> 41:58.081
and she took the spirit
of the young woman

41:58.083 --> 42:00.617
and put it into the plant.

42:00.619 --> 42:03.553
Occasionally,
the young woman emerges

42:03.555 --> 42:08.157
to enjoy the view,
in the form of a cactus flower.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.693
Protected and together
for eternity.

42:10.695 --> 42:11.794
Ah.

42:13.565 --> 42:15.098
Ladies and gentlemen,

42:15.100 --> 42:17.534

42:17.536 --> 42:18.635
