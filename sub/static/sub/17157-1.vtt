00:30.800 --> 00:33.267
I am so impressed.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.033
What do you think
of Freddy?

00:35.033 --> 00:37.267
- Eh, decent kickflip,
wicked railslide,

00:37.267 --> 00:38.833
but I'd have to see him
on the half-pipe

00:38.833 --> 00:40.500
before judging him.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.267
- Can't you just say he's cute
like a normal person?

00:43.267 --> 00:45.867
- He's cute.
Are you happy?

00:45.867 --> 00:48.767

- Whoa, Freddy!

00:55.733 --> 00:58.767
- Yeah, 28 seconds.
New record.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.600
- I built this rocket
in record time too--

01:01.600 --> 01:03.367
eight months.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.533
It's not a fast sport.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.133
- Lawrence,
you better hide that.

01:09.133 --> 01:10.800
You know rockets
are against the rules.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.700
- Freddy should get
in more trouble than me.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.333
He just skateboarded
down the hallways

01:14.333 --> 01:16.633
like he was
in a body spray commercial.

01:17.900 --> 01:21.600
- Freddy, skateboarding
is against school rules.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.167
- Hello, Mrs. Calpakis.
You look lovely today.

01:25.167 --> 01:26.500

This is going
in the Confiscation Closet.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.567
Someone could get hurt.

01:34.567 --> 01:36.267
- Can't you just be chill
about this?

01:36.267 --> 01:37.967
- Oh, I'm more chill
than you think.

01:37.967 --> 01:40.267
In fact,
I used to roller boogie.

01:42.967 --> 01:45.367
Oh. Oh.

01:48.467 --> 01:49.833
Ow.

- I was speaking
to the children.

yourself a nickname.

to teach you guys.

I want to inspire--Aah!

04:15.400 --> 04:17.667
All I'm saying

04:17.667 --> 04:20.733
is that we can do this

05:16.700 --> 05:18.600
There's got to be a catch.
- Yeah.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.133
- All right, it says here

05:20.133 --> 05:23.100
y'all are discussing sonnets
by William Shakespeare.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.933
- Yeah.
We're stuck on a sonnet

05:24.933 --> 05:27.233
that just does not make
any sense.

05:27.233 --> 05:28.300
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.900
Well, you can always tell

05:29.900 --> 05:32.533
everything you need to know
about a poem from its title.

05:32.533 --> 05:36.633
So this is called
"Sonnet 137."

there's a better way

to learn Shakespeare--by adding
a little rock and roll.

play classical.

pushing you a little too hard,

I reread that sonnet and
realized what it really is.

08:48.067 --> 08:50.467
It's an angry breakup song.

- Oh, so like
a Taylor Swift song.

08:52.433 --> 08:54.200

he's a real teacher.

10:29.867 --> 10:32.933
He asked to borrow
lunch money.

11:11.267 --> 11:13.433
- Dewey Finn?
Teacher?

11:13.433 --> 11:15.900
He's not qualified
to teach dog to bark,

11:15.900 --> 11:18.300
but he is a rock god!

11:18.300 --> 11:19.533
Whoo!

11:19.533 --> 11:20.733
- Rock and roll!

11:28.067 --> 11:31.700
Oh.
Hey, guys.

11:31.700 --> 11:34.933
- Definitely
not a teacher.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.067
[rock music]

11:40.067 --> 11:42.300
- Morning, class.

11:43.633 --> 11:46.200
Oh, I get it--
the silent treatment.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.467
- We're mad at you!

11:48.467 --> 11:51.533
What? I'm not good
at the silent treatment.

11:51.533 --> 11:53.900
And, Zack, I'm still mad at you
for drinking my smoothie

11:53.900 --> 11:55.833
in the third grade.

11:55.833 --> 11:59.067
I'm getting it all out,
people!

11:59.067 --> 12:00.667
- I'm sorry I lied to you.

12:00.667 --> 12:02.367
- You're not even
a real teacher.

12:02.367 --> 12:04.533
- You're right.
Until two days ago,

12:04.533 --> 12:06.533
I worked at my uncle's
yogurt cart on Sixth Street

12:06.533 --> 12:10.067
during the day and tried to be
a rock star at night--

12:10.067 --> 12:12.433
playing gigs,
staying up late,

12:12.433 --> 12:16.167
thousands of people
screaming my name.

12:16.167 --> 12:19.067
Well, like, 30, but still...

12:19.067 --> 12:21.600
- That sounds awesome.
- Yeah.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.067
My whole world was trying
to win Battle of the Bands.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.733
- What's Battle of the Bands?

12:26.733 --> 12:27.967
- It's this epic contest

12:27.967 --> 12:29.600
with all the best bands
in Austin.

12:29.600 --> 12:33.200
If your band wins,
you become legendary.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.233
But I gave all that up.

12:35.233 --> 12:37.067
Last night was my last gig.

12:37.067 --> 12:38.367
- Why?

12:38.367 --> 12:40.133
- Because I'm at that stage
in my life

12:40.133 --> 12:41.767
where I want
something real.

12:41.767 --> 12:46.333
- Something real,
like fake teaching?

12:46.333 --> 12:49.067
- Look, my mom's
a substitute teacher,

12:49.067 --> 12:50.600
and she loves it,

12:50.600 --> 12:53.633
so I fibbed about my
qualifications to get this job,

12:53.633 --> 12:54.900
and you know what?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.333
I love it too.

12:57.333 --> 13:01.433
Being your teacher is way cooler
than playing any club,

13:01.433 --> 13:02.867
and that's the truth.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.467
[high-pitched voice]
I say we forgive him.

13:09.467 --> 13:13.600
- Look, we like you too,
but we have to learn stuff.

13:13.600 --> 13:17.800
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. Finn,
but we need a real teacher.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.167
all: Yeah.

13:19.167 --> 13:20.967
- I don't know, guys.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.867
The skull makes
a strong argument.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.800
- The skull's an idiot.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.900
My dad wants me
to get into Yale.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.567

Are you gonna turn me in?

13:30.567 --> 13:32.767
- We don't know,
but right now we have to go.

Principal Mullins makes us
play a recital in the quad

13:35.067 --> 13:36.300
once a month.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.667
You know,
what you did was not cool.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.500
- Don't look at me
like that.

13:50.533 --> 13:55.967

13:55.967 --> 13:58.633
- I wish we could rock out
like we did with Mr. Finn.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.633
- Principal Mullins
would kill us.

14:00.633 --> 14:02.533
Then my dad would kill me.

14:02.533 --> 14:05.167
I'd be dead twice.

14:05.167 --> 14:07.233
- Principal Mullins,
we have a situation.

There's a 483 in progress.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.400
Let's roll.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.100
- Principal Mullins
is gone.

14:15.100 --> 14:18.500
We can do this the boring way
or the Mr. Finn way.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.067
- Summer, do you know
"What I Like About You"?

14:20.067 --> 14:22.800
- Is it my smile, my eyes,
the way I make you feel?

14:22.800 --> 14:25.233
- I meant the song
"What I Like About You."

14:25.233 --> 14:27.333
- Oh.
Yeah, me too.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.833
Are those not the lyrics?
[chuckles]

14:29.833 --> 14:31.367

about being in a rock band?

- Yes.
Oh, rock band?

15:38.100 --> 15:39.967
No.

rock and roll.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.800

no way Principal Mullins

15:45.800 --> 15:48.233
will let us play
rock music in class.

You guys were right.

back to my old job.

16:21.533 --> 16:24.800
Just so you know,

was one of the greatest honors

gonna be okay?

strapped to it?
