WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:02.033
(Birds chirp)
(Car honks)

00:02.069 --> 00:04.903
- Just the "little farmer's
breakfast" for me, Twyla.

00:04.939 --> 00:06.905
I've got the tasting for
the wedding this afternoon,

00:06.974 --> 00:09.508
don't wanna spoil my appetite.

00:09.643 --> 00:12.945
- Oh! You're not using
the café for catering?

00:12.947 --> 00:15.314
- Yes, John. Why wouldn't
you have Twyla

00:15.449 --> 00:17.248
cater David's big day?

00:17.284 --> 00:20.719
- Well, the food for the
wedding is my gift to David,

00:20.854 --> 00:24.256
so it's really his decision.
- (Chuckles)

00:24.391 --> 00:26.758
It's just the more you keep
mentioning that it's a gift,

00:26.827 --> 00:29.394
the less and less
it feels like a gift.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.397
- You know, I-I was just
thinking that, you know,

00:32.466 --> 00:34.733
how can Twyla enjoy herself
at the wedding

00:34.802 --> 00:36.869
if she's-if she's working?

00:36.871 --> 00:38.903
- I'm invited to the wedding?

00:38.939 --> 00:40.839
- Sure looks like it.
(Both laugh)

00:40.974 --> 00:43.408
- Look at you, John, doling out
gift after gift this morning

00:43.444 --> 00:46.277
like the Turkish
Saint Nikolaas.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.147
I'll just have the fruit cup
to go, please.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.616
I must attend to some good news
of my own.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.384
- Coming right up.

00:54.355 --> 00:57.089
- David, I didn't know she
wasn't invited to the wedding.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.758
- Well, you certainly fixed
that problem for yourself.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.493
What's your good news?

01:01.495 --> 01:02.794
- Thank you.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.297
Tippy Bernstein
is on his way here.

01:05.299 --> 01:08.233
He solicited a power-lunch
with me today.

01:08.368 --> 01:10.769
- Well, there is a name
I haven't heard in a while.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.971
Tippy Bernstein was
the executive producer

01:13.107 --> 01:16.040
on "Sunrise Bay."
What could he possibly want?

01:16.077 --> 01:18.243
- I'm assuming a new project.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.178
Tippy always had his fingers
in a few fires.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.847
Oh dear.

01:21.916 --> 01:25.184
- Good God.
- Brave faces everyone.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.919
- Hey.
- Alexis!

01:27.955 --> 01:31.623
Oh, you're looking so natural
and peppy.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.926
- A bit of a rough night
actually.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.094
- Oh.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.329
- Well, you're fooling
everyone, dear.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.798
- Mhmm. Um... you just have,

01:39.933 --> 01:41.399
you have something
in your hair.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.202
Here. I'm just gonna grab...
that.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.070
- Is it gone?
- Yeah. (Nervous chuckle)

01:45.072 --> 01:46.271
Yeah.

01:46.340 --> 01:51.176
♪♪♪

01:52.279 --> 01:54.946
- Well, thanks for turning up
so early, everyone.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.115
And welcome.
My name is Johnny--

01:56.250 --> 01:57.682
- Johnny Rose.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.618
it's printed right here
on the cover of the book

01:59.687 --> 02:01.086
that he's handing out
to all of you.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.255
And my name is Roland Schitt--

02:03.390 --> 02:05.157
and I'm the boss
you're gonna come to

02:05.292 --> 02:07.025
when you don't understand
why this guy

02:07.094 --> 02:09.261
is making you read
about VHS tapes.

02:09.396 --> 02:12.430
- Not exactly the united front
we had discussed, Roland.

02:12.432 --> 02:15.833
- Well, Johnny, somebody has
to inspire these people.

02:15.870 --> 02:18.770
- Well, welcome to the Rosebud
Motel family.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.306
Oh, there is our other partner,
Stevie Budd!

02:21.441 --> 02:24.309
Stevie, do you wanna come over
and say hi to our new staff?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.578
- Uh, I think I need to speak
to you for a minute in private.

02:26.713 --> 02:29.248
- Well, no need for that,
we're all family here.

02:30.717 --> 02:33.986
- Okay. Ronnie found termite
damage in Room Six

02:34.121 --> 02:36.454
and apparently the entire
foundation

02:36.456 --> 02:38.556
is about to collapse.
- Uh, Stevie,

02:38.592 --> 02:40.792
that's really something we
should talk about in private.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.527
- Mhmm.
- Tell you what?

02:42.596 --> 02:44.862
Why don't we take five,
and feel free to help yourself

02:44.899 --> 02:47.566
to one of our vending machine
over there.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.268
(Chuckles)
Here you go.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.937
- Welcome everyone.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.972
- How are we gonna cover
these costs?

02:54.041 --> 02:57.442
- Well, I gave one of my
kidneys to my cousin Bruce.

02:57.444 --> 03:00.646
Uh, we can see how I run
on an empty tank.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.749
- I went to school with a guy
who starts "accidental" fires.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.216
I mean, worse comes to worst,

03:05.252 --> 03:07.019
we could collect
the insurance money.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.820
- Okay. We're not burning
anything down

03:08.889 --> 03:10.889
and we're not selling any
organs.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.624
We're knee-deep in this now.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.426
We're just have
to figure out where

03:14.495 --> 03:16.361
we're gonna find the money.
- Okay. That's good,

03:16.430 --> 03:18.797
because Bruce told me
my kidney was garbage.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.502
- Take the pills, Vivian.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.438
- A "please" might be nice!

03:26.440 --> 03:28.240
- You really think you'd be
head of surgery

03:28.375 --> 03:29.908
at Sunrise General

03:29.910 --> 03:31.776
if you weren't possessed
by your father?

03:31.845 --> 03:33.845
Who also happened to be
the former

03:33.914 --> 03:35.713
head of surgery at Sunrise
General?

03:35.749 --> 03:38.083
- Oh, enjoying the box set,
are we?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.252
(Turns TV off)
- This season is weird.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.853
You're great in it,

03:41.855 --> 03:43.388
but I forgot how bad
Clifton Sparks was.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.190
- Oh, it's Uncle Sparky to you,
Dear.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.192
- Also, I'm so confused.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.528
Why is Vivian the only one
who gets possessed

03:49.530 --> 03:51.196
when Trystan also played
the Ouija game?

03:51.198 --> 03:53.464
- Oh, suddenly she's
the director.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.400
- (Grunts)

03:55.402 --> 03:57.102
- And where do we think
we're going?

03:57.171 --> 03:59.137
- Well, I feel like your
publicist should be there

03:59.173 --> 04:01.273
if you're meeting
with Tickle Bernstein.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.008
- (Chuckles) Tippy.
It's Tippy, and no,

04:03.010 --> 04:05.010
not necessary, dear.
Not in your condition.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.478
Thank you.
- No it's fine.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.513
I'll just throw on some clothes.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.015
- No! I insist.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.250
Mummy can handle this one
all by herself.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.753
All right? What's important is
that you stay here

04:14.755 --> 04:16.355
where no one can see you

04:16.490 --> 04:18.890
and focus on your critical
self-care.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.492
(Alexis turns the TV on)

04:20.561 --> 04:22.394
- Oh, I wanna see this.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.064
- You can and you know it!

04:27.434 --> 04:30.568
- How dare you make me
kill my father twice!

04:30.570 --> 04:32.037
(Slap)
- (Gasps)

04:32.039 --> 04:33.505
(Repeated slaps
and pained grunts)

04:33.574 --> 04:35.474
- You'll pay for this one day.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.583
<i> David: I think that's a must.</i>

04:45.619 --> 04:47.486
I honestly don't know
what to pick.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.655
- Mr. Rose,
this looks pretty fancy.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.924
You sure you're okay
to pay for it?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.992
I know you have the motel
to worry about.

04:55.029 --> 04:57.061
- Well, I can't back out now,
Stevie.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.863
- David would understand.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.799
I mean, not at first,

05:00.868 --> 05:03.401
but deep down he's not
a total monster.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.003
- So we're two minutes late

05:05.005 --> 05:06.538
and if this were the actual
wedding,

05:06.540 --> 05:08.373
the doors would be closed
and you would be locked out.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.609
Okay? Um, this is Penelope,
she's our caterer.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.110
Penelope, this is my Dad,

05:12.179 --> 05:14.078
who's footing the bill
for the food.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.281
Stevie is my Maid of Honour,
she's just here to eat.

05:16.283 --> 05:19.685
So Penelope and I have already
selected an appetizer.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.887
- Wow. This is quite
the spread.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.089
Looks very impressive, son.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.758
Expensive but impressive!
- Hm.

05:26.794 --> 05:30.562
- Oh, I like this,
little side salad.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.030
- Poor thing.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.833
That's the garnish
for the lobster roll.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.102
- Lobster! Ah.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.804
Are we inviting The Vanderbilts?

05:38.806 --> 05:40.038
- I said lobster roll.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.607
And to your point, we have
not discussed the salad.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.876
- Oh, I have an amazing
parmesan, arugula

05:45.011 --> 05:46.645
and black truffle salad

05:46.647 --> 05:48.513
that would complement
the evening perfectly.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.181
- My God! Yes!
- Or... or...

05:51.251 --> 05:53.518
if we're not using the lettuce
under the lobster roll

05:53.554 --> 05:57.055
can we just not make a side
salad out of this lettuce?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.858
- Are these prices per table?
- Um, per plate.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.926
And speaking of, we are adding
eight more plates.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.862
I was finally allowed to invite
some friends from New York,

06:03.931 --> 06:06.230
they're a caviar crowd.
- Oh, I love that idea.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.666
- I love that.
- Caviar?

06:07.668 --> 06:09.034
- Huh?

06:09.036 --> 06:11.402
- Would anyone like to try
some beef tenderloin?

06:11.438 --> 06:12.871
- Oh, sure. Sure.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.806
Oh, you know what they say
about tenderloin;

06:14.842 --> 06:16.408
always a risky option.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.477
It's gotta be done just,
just right.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.148
- Hmmm...

06:25.018 --> 06:27.152
- Mmm.
- Yes.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.553
- Mmm.
- Yes.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.122
- Well, you know, it's-it's...
it's fine.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.456
- It's fine?

06:31.492 --> 06:33.458
- Oh, it's the best thing
I've ever tasted.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.293
- Well, you don't want people
coming to your wedding

06:35.429 --> 06:37.295
and only talking about
the food.

06:37.297 --> 06:39.096
- That is literally
the only thing

06:39.133 --> 06:40.965
I want them talking about.
What is wrong with you?

06:41.100 --> 06:43.234
You love beef tenderloin.
- No, I'm just exploring,

06:43.270 --> 06:45.003
you know, other options.
- Okay.

06:45.138 --> 06:48.039
Well, might I suggest you
explore the duck confit

06:48.041 --> 06:51.710
- Why not, it's not like we're
paying for the samples.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.244
(Nervous chuckle)

06:53.313 --> 06:55.080
We're not paying for
the samples, are we?

06:55.082 --> 06:56.747
- No.
- Oh.

06:56.784 --> 06:59.384
Okay. Then do you wanna put
a bit more tenderloin

06:59.519 --> 07:01.453
on there, please.
- Of course.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.424
(Bell over door jingles)

07:07.995 --> 07:09.861
(Taps table)
- Moira Fucking Rose. Wow.

07:09.996 --> 07:11.830
I mean, I figured time stood
still in this town,

07:11.965 --> 07:13.465
but look at you!

07:13.534 --> 07:15.166
You are just as gorgeous

07:15.235 --> 07:16.868
as the day I discovered you.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.803
- Oh Tippy.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.206
You're as alive as ever!

07:21.208 --> 07:22.740
No, don't get up!

07:22.810 --> 07:24.141
- No, no. Don't worry about it.

07:24.178 --> 07:26.077
Cured that vertigo years ago.
I hired a hynotherapist.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.612
Then I married her.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.347
And then I divorced her.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.750
(In a hypnotized voice)
You-are-getting-very... broke.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.418
- Ha! (Laughs)

07:33.553 --> 07:35.553
Tippy, I have missed
that vaudevillian charm.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.822
- Oh, Honey,
it's been far too long,

07:37.858 --> 07:39.357
but I come bearing gifts.

07:39.359 --> 07:41.359
And the first one's standing
right over there.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.929
- Clifton!

07:44.965 --> 07:46.631
- Muffy!

07:46.700 --> 07:49.000
Looking luscious as always.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.536
- Oh, had I known you were both
coming,

07:51.672 --> 07:54.138
I'd have dressed
for the occasion.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.607
- (Groans)

07:55.609 --> 07:58.142
- You're looking fresh and dewy.

07:58.212 --> 07:59.544
- Gave up the drink.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.179
Strictly a wine
and scotch man now.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.180
- Listen, what do you say
we all take a load off

08:03.217 --> 08:06.051
because this standing thing is
not all it's cracked up to be.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.956
- Cliffy! Cliffy,
I have not seen you

08:11.091 --> 08:13.391
since you starred in that
electrifying courtroom drama

08:13.460 --> 08:16.193
about the potty mouth,
feral child.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.929
- Oh, that was an actual
court case.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.997
My daughter wanted to emancipate

08:20.033 --> 08:21.933
and the press couldn't get
enough.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.135
- Lucky you!
- Speaking of...

08:24.204 --> 08:27.305
the press can't get
enough of you, Moira.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.440
That "Crow" picture.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.142
I mean, who'd have thought?

08:31.211 --> 08:33.411
- Oh. Thank you!

08:33.480 --> 08:35.580
And what did you think,
Clifton?

08:35.582 --> 08:37.782
- I can't wait for the screener.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.585
- So, I'm sure you're dying to
know what this is all about,

08:40.587 --> 08:42.521
and since this isn't sweeps
weeks,

08:42.656 --> 08:44.155
I won't keep you hanging.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.157
- My imagination has become

08:46.159 --> 08:47.692
rather unbridled
since you called.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.428
Let me guess. A reunion?

08:50.564 --> 08:52.997
- No, it's much, much, much,
much better.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.634
- Some sort of televised event?
It's a panel?

08:55.636 --> 08:57.101
Late night?

08:57.137 --> 09:00.005
- They wanna reboot
"Sunrise Bay!"

09:00.007 --> 09:01.306
- What? Who--

09:01.441 --> 09:03.174
- No, no. It's a big, big
co-production.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.243
All the good people want in.
Moira, it's gonna be raw,

09:05.378 --> 09:07.579
it's gonna be edgy,
and primetime!

09:07.648 --> 09:09.047
A sexy new cast,

09:09.116 --> 09:10.848
but they have asked
for prominent characters

09:10.918 --> 09:12.917
from the original to ground
the whole thing.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.086
So I called Clifton...
- Alphabetical.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.588
- and he said...
- I said,

09:16.657 --> 09:18.990
I wouldn't do it without you.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.826
And that was before
Nicole Kidman signed on

09:21.828 --> 09:23.828
as Adriana's daughter.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.230
- Nicole Kidman.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.334
And I was believing you both
up till now.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.569
- No, no, no.
M-Moira this is all true.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.005
- Have you forgotten that
Vivian was killed off?

09:34.041 --> 09:35.873
- When has that ever stop us?

09:35.875 --> 09:37.576
- But that last time
I was shredded.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.011
- That's why we have writers.
Let them do their magic.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.013
- Oops, oops.
What do we have here?

09:42.148 --> 09:44.882
What is that? Is this maybe
a very generous offer

09:44.918 --> 09:48.420
for a direct to-series
primetime Emmy contender.

09:48.555 --> 09:51.155
Have a read.
Have a read of that

09:51.191 --> 09:53.024
and then maybe meet up
with us later tonight?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.826
- We can celebrate over drinks.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.128
- I don't know what to say.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.898
- It's a simple answer, Vivian.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.034
Say yes.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.910
- (Door opens) Alexis!
Do I have news--

10:12.946 --> 10:14.746
- Okay, thank God you're here

10:14.881 --> 10:16.080
because I have so many
questions.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.349
Like, why did they kill off
your character

10:18.484 --> 10:20.618
after you had just given birth
to your ninth child

10:20.654 --> 10:23.321
and escaped from the cave with
the secret about your lover...

10:23.390 --> 10:25.123
- Who was a ghost, yes.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.925
- ...and then they killed off in
like the most humiliating way.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.060
- I'm not sure I call it
humiliating.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.062
- You vomited a demon
into a toilet,

10:31.197 --> 10:32.664
and then fell in and drowned.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.666
- Well, the writers insisted
it was symbolic.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.367
Nevertheless,
I have something--

10:36.403 --> 10:37.969
- And then they shredded you.
- Yes.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.871
Yes. I should have seen
that coming

10:39.940 --> 10:41.305
after the contract demands but--

10:41.341 --> 10:43.207
- Okay yes.
Re: that drama.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.410
I just fell down a dark
Sunrise fan-hole

10:45.412 --> 10:47.545
and found this message board
about conspiracy theories.

10:47.581 --> 10:49.681
- Oh Alexis.
- There are a lot of fans

10:49.683 --> 10:51.616
who think Clifton Sparks
had you written off the show

10:51.751 --> 10:53.985
because he was jealous.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.087
- Don't be a dotty,
poor Alexis.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.824
No I, unwittingly negotiated
myself off the show.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.793
End of story.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.728
- Okay. You watch this video

11:03.864 --> 11:05.697
and tell me who you think
he's referring to then.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.031
(Light taps)
- (Frustrated groan)

11:07.034 --> 11:08.566
- Come.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.503
- There has been some
serious Sunrise intrigue

11:12.539 --> 11:14.539
around the sudden departure
of Vivian Blake.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.040
Can you tell us what happened?

11:16.043 --> 11:17.842
- (Slurring) She had a good run.

11:17.878 --> 11:21.512
But let's just say "someone"
reminded the producers

11:21.548 --> 11:24.716
that there's only room
for one head of surgery

11:24.718 --> 11:26.517
at Sunrise General.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.787
And I think all
you housewives at home

11:29.856 --> 11:31.756
know who that should be.

11:31.891 --> 11:33.625
- See, he's basically admitting

11:33.760 --> 11:35.927
to having you written off
the show.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.395
- No. He's drunk there.
No. That's not--

11:37.397 --> 11:39.397
No, Alexis I came here
to tell you something...

11:40.434 --> 11:43.201
I've been asked
to resuscitate Vivian

11:43.203 --> 11:46.771
so that she may live again
in a primetime reboot.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.707
- Is Clifton involved?

11:49.776 --> 11:52.076
- Alexis, he drove all this way

11:52.079 --> 11:54.345
just to personally beg me
to acquiesce.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.880
- Hm. Of course he did.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.749
- You're the only person
in the show making headlines

11:57.751 --> 11:59.884
right now.
- That's not true.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.954
Adriana had that DUI last year.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.789
Popped a breasts, poor dear

12:04.924 --> 12:06.725
- They need you.
And all I'm saying is,

12:06.860 --> 12:08.760
as your publicist
and your daughter,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.029
and now the moderator of
the "Sunrise Bay" fan forum,

12:11.031 --> 12:12.830
there's more to this story.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.432
And if you wanna go through
with this

12:14.501 --> 12:16.400
after watching that video?

12:16.470 --> 12:18.136
Just remember that there
is nothing wrong

12:18.138 --> 12:20.471
with asking for what you
deserve.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.641
Perhaps a little more housework
and little less mouse work

12:23.777 --> 12:25.743
might do you some good, Alexis.

12:25.812 --> 12:28.480
But thank you for your pair
of pennies.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.718
- Hmm.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.122
- Good news, Stevie, I think
I may have found someone

12:38.158 --> 12:40.191
who can do the fumigation
for half the price.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.127
His name's Phil.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.195
He's got a lot
of two-star reviews,

12:44.197 --> 12:47.398
but that's one more star
than the other guys.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.001
- Will the savings cover
the cost

12:50.136 --> 12:52.003
of rebuilding the foundation?

12:52.072 --> 12:54.939
- No. No they won't.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.141
So I guess the news isn't
that good after all.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.377
(Door opens)
- Ooh, hi.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.746
Hi. Oh, still eating
the tenderloin?

13:01.881 --> 13:03.714
- Well, they were just gonna
throw it out, David.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.483
- Oh.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.018
Um, I noticed that there
was some awkwardness

13:08.054 --> 13:10.988
earlier at the tasting,
and I just got the sense

13:11.024 --> 13:13.091
that you were uncomfortable
about something.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.726
- (Covering) Oh?

13:14.861 --> 13:16.160
I don't know why you would
think that.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.728
- Penelope asked
if you wanted to crack

13:17.764 --> 13:19.364
the top of the creme brulée
and you asked,

13:19.499 --> 13:21.332
"If we break it, do we buy it?"

13:21.401 --> 13:23.701
- Well, I think that was a
perfectly legitimate question

13:23.837 --> 13:27.105
considering I wasn't even
hungry after the beef.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.506
- Okay. I know what's going on.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.643
- You do?
- Yeah, and don't worry,

13:31.778 --> 13:33.511
you don't have to cover
the cost of the extra table.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.147
That's eight plates than you
hadn't budgeted for.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.516
Plus Patrick's parents ended up
giving us way more money

13:38.585 --> 13:41.185
than we had expected.
- Oh.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.887
- Yeah. Apparently there is
some nest egg they set aside

13:43.023 --> 13:44.322
for Patrick and his ex-fiancée.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.658
So honestly you have to pay
for anything

13:46.793 --> 13:48.426
if it's going to be a strain.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.528
- David,

13:50.597 --> 13:53.064
I said I would cover the food...
- Okay.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.468
- but if the Brewers wanna pay
for the extra table,

13:57.470 --> 14:01.472
then I think that's a wonderful
gesture form the Brewers.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.408
- Great. What did I tell you
about that beef?

14:04.410 --> 14:06.211
- Oh good.
- Right?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.980
So good, right?
- Hmm.

14:10.049 --> 14:11.950
(Door shuts)

14:18.058 --> 14:19.691
- Mr. Rose,

14:22.028 --> 14:24.095
It's not gonna always be
like this.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.899
- You know, we had a sizable
nest egg set aside

14:28.034 --> 14:30.101
for David's wedding.

14:31.838 --> 14:34.305
He was talking about Bali
for a while.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.711
We were gonna charter
some jets.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.615
Fly everybody.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.554
I'm gonna get some air, Stevie.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.057
(Receding footsteps)

14:55.195 --> 14:57.195
(Door opens and shuts)

14:59.332 --> 15:00.865
- (Sighs)

15:05.372 --> 15:07.272
(Crickets chirp)

15:09.276 --> 15:11.008
(Low hum of chatter,
music plays)

15:11.044 --> 15:13.978
- Please. You know,
I'm not interested in that.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.579
- Room for one more?

15:15.615 --> 15:17.515
- Muffy, grab a chair.
I hope you don't mind,

15:17.650 --> 15:20.151
we decided to get a head start
on the celebration.

15:20.286 --> 15:21.920
- Extra dry? Extra olive?

15:22.055 --> 15:24.621
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Bernstein!

15:24.658 --> 15:27.892
- Hey, tell that cute bartender
I'd love a sex on the beach.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.127
If she has time,
I need another scotch.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.663
- Ha! You better hurry
if you want to catch up.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.966
- Oh no, this doctor would
rather nurse her potable,

15:35.035 --> 15:36.567
if you don't mind.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.103
Best to stay lucid
for our congress.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.772
- Hey. Remember how you entered
that time machine

15:41.841 --> 15:44.175
you discovered in the
hospital's broom closet?

15:44.310 --> 15:45.376
Season Three?

15:45.511 --> 15:47.378
What if we bring you back
that way?

15:47.380 --> 15:48.879
- (Chuckles)

15:48.915 --> 15:51.915
- It's not easy to disremember
my final demise.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.986
It was even more vicious
than Vivian's getting trampled

15:54.988 --> 15:57.688
while honeymooning
in Pamplona.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.590
- Oh Moira! Get over it!

15:59.626 --> 16:02.994
Contract negotiations
go sour all the time!

16:04.464 --> 16:06.431
- What do you know about
my contract?

16:06.433 --> 16:07.999
- What?

16:08.068 --> 16:10.134
- I believe I gave you a new
contract today.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.203
Did you-did you bring it?

16:14.908 --> 16:16.907
- Clifton...
- Hm?

16:16.977 --> 16:19.009
- there are fans who think that

16:19.045 --> 16:21.545
you might have had something
to do with

16:21.581 --> 16:23.881
my being written off the show.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.284
- (Laughs) What?! Who?
Why would...?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.286
Look, Moira, there were
a lot of egos back then,

16:28.421 --> 16:30.221
and I was different man.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.190
That was before my liver
transplant.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.158
- Is it true?

16:34.293 --> 16:36.294
- Think of it as a compliment.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.530
Your star was rising,
and I was maybe jealous.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.099
- Oh, would you look at this.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.900
I'm getting texts
from Nicole's office.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.335
Serves me right for sharing
EP credit. These people--

16:45.372 --> 16:47.504
- I'm guessing, Clifton
was also responsible

16:47.540 --> 16:49.640
for my name being
repeatedly left off

16:49.709 --> 16:51.575
the Daytime Emmy ballot?

16:51.611 --> 16:53.344
- No, we submitted you
every year.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.246
And-and that season that
you played your own brother

16:55.248 --> 16:57.648
we submitted you for
Best Actress and Actor.

16:57.650 --> 16:58.949
- You did what?

16:59.019 --> 17:01.085
- Oh, Tippy,
I did not negotiate myself

17:01.221 --> 17:03.454
out of the job, did I?

17:04.491 --> 17:06.724
- You deserved every penny.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.793
Please Moira,

17:08.795 --> 17:11.796
I want you to consider
this offer as my amends.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.232
If you sign on them, we all get
back to doing what we love.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.134
- There is something I love

17:17.170 --> 17:19.537
that I haven't been able
to do for quite some time.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.640
(Repeated slaps)
- (Pained grunts)

17:24.577 --> 17:27.278
- Now, Mr. Bernstein,
I have a few demands.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.049
(Dog barks in the distance,
car whooshes by)

17:31.184 --> 17:33.017
(Noisy eating)
- Hm. Hm. Mmm.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.585
I don't know, Johnny,

17:34.587 --> 17:37.255
I have been racking my brain
to come up with the cash.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.889
I mean at this point,

17:38.958 --> 17:41.826
I'm willing to sell my baseball
signed by Geena Davis.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.629
- Might take more than that,
Roland.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.031
- Gentlemen. Hello.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.966
- Stevie.
- Hello.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.301
- Well, apologies for calling
such a late meeting

17:51.337 --> 17:55.573
but I think you'll both agree
we're in a bit of a situation.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.275
- And by "situation"

17:57.410 --> 17:59.444
he means that money-pit
of a motel we bought.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.246
- No, I stand by the decision
to expand our business

18:02.315 --> 18:04.315
but at this point,
I think our only option

18:04.384 --> 18:06.450
is to sell the second motel,

18:06.519 --> 18:08.786
and recoup whatever we can.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.387
- Yeah, and I'm in total
agreement.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.723
- Well, I don't like that idea.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.258
- I don't like that idea
at all.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.026
What else you got, Johnny?

18:16.096 --> 18:19.263
- What if we bought
30 more motels?

18:19.398 --> 18:20.998
Right now.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.235
- What am I looking at?

18:25.271 --> 18:28.205
- These are all the roadside
motels currently for sale.

18:28.341 --> 18:31.475
Now bottom line,
we're not gonna make money

18:31.478 --> 18:32.943
off of two or three locations.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.346
We're only gonna start seeing
the real money

18:35.415 --> 18:37.748
at 20 or 30 locations.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.217
- Yeah, I'm with Stevie,
it's a lost cause.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.553
- Now this would be
a bigger undertaking.

18:42.688 --> 18:45.890
And if we franchised
on a larger scale,

18:45.892 --> 18:47.758
yeah, the dividends
would be greater.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.660
Stevie, where did you
come up with this?

18:49.795 --> 18:51.862
- Oh, it was in a book
I was given.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.898
I don't know,
maybe you read it.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.701
You did this before, Mr. Rose.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.037
I think you can do it again.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.508
- Well, we would need a proper
investor to pull this off.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.877
You know, for the first time,

19:06.913 --> 19:09.914
I think I can actually call in
some favours with this idea.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.650
I mean, we'd need a really
strong pitch.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.252
And boy, I-I don't even know
if anyone from the old life

19:15.321 --> 19:17.121
would even take a meeting but--

19:17.256 --> 19:18.956
- A wise man once wrote:

19:19.091 --> 19:21.592
"You miss 100% of the tapes
you don't play".

19:21.628 --> 19:23.794
- I did write that.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.797
- And I know that
a wise man once wrote:

19:26.799 --> 19:29.733
"Thank you to my wife, Moira."

19:29.802 --> 19:32.136
- That's just the dedication,
Roland.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.438
- That's as far as I got,
Johnny.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.008
I'm sorry, I'm partial
to historical fiction.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.349
("Sunrise Bay" plays on TV)

19:45.418 --> 19:47.752
- Oh Alexis, has our quarantine
been lifted?

19:47.754 --> 19:49.420
- Yeah, I was scared
I was gonna get bed sores,

19:49.489 --> 19:50.954
so I'm going for a run.

19:50.990 --> 19:54.025
Also, I needed to like cleanse
my brain a bit.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.893
'Cause eight hours of watching
"Sunrise Bay"

19:56.028 --> 19:57.962
made me feel a little
not-right in the head.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.563
- It had that effect.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.365
The New England Journal
of Medicine

20:01.500 --> 20:03.634
did a fascinating study on it.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.769
- Will you be trapped in this
crystal the entire episode?

20:05.838 --> 20:07.571
- Best to skip ahead.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.140
- So how was the meeting?

20:09.142 --> 20:11.541
- You Alexis are one shrewd
little Reynard.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.544
You were right about Clifton.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.479
- He sucks in this, by the way.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.414
- So he had you written off
the show?

20:17.483 --> 20:19.783
- Yes, but I used
that little nugget

20:19.819 --> 20:22.220
to negotiate a superior deal.
- Hm?

20:22.355 --> 20:23.821
- I am after all,

20:23.956 --> 20:25.957
the one in the cast member
still making headlines.

20:26.092 --> 20:28.859
- So you still said yes?

20:28.861 --> 20:30.228
- I did.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.796
But on the condition

20:31.931 --> 20:34.665
that Clifton be written off
the show - death of my choosing.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.667
And I asked for more money.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.201
- Okay. Yass, Mom.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.870
- And a diamond tennis bracelet.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.606
- Okay. Well, that seems like
a bit much.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.340
But it still sounds like you
got what you're worth?

20:43.476 --> 20:45.076
- Oh, God no.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.511
I made them an offer
they had to refuse.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.313
- So, you're not doing it then?

20:49.382 --> 20:50.982
- No. Thank you, Alexis.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.417
Thank you for removing
my rosy lunettes,

20:53.419 --> 20:56.287
so that I might see Clifton
for who he really is.

20:56.289 --> 20:59.222
If you did all that
without getting out of bed,

20:59.259 --> 21:01.892
imagine what you're capable
of doing.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.894
- Okay, how is it
that your daughter

21:03.896 --> 21:06.897
is also trapped in the cave
but has never looked up once.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.233
You've been hanging over her
for three straight episodes.

21:09.368 --> 21:11.302
- Oh, you know, children, this
is where the season picks up.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.372
When the cave starts talking
back to me.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.574
Voiced by the wonderful
Peter Falk.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.477
- I was gonna go for a run.
- Shh. She's about to look up.
