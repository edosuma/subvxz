00:06.272 --> 00:07.905
we are now in overtime.

You're gonna say 20%,
I'm gonna say 15.

00:10.276 --> 00:12.476
How about we end up at 17 1/2?

00:12.477 --> 00:14.111
Let's say 18.
17.

00:14.112 --> 00:15.512
You just went down.

00:15.513 --> 00:16.547
You see how this works?

00:16.548 --> 00:19.115
Try negotiating
your salary with him.

00:19.117 --> 00:21.484
Okay, 17 1/2 it is.

00:21.486 --> 00:22.452
17 1/2.

00:22.454 --> 00:24.420
I think that's it.
Good.

00:24.422 --> 00:25.989
Actually, there's
one other thing.

00:25.992 --> 00:28.625
Oh, come on, Johnny. Can't we do
the pension thing next quarter?

00:28.626 --> 00:30.025
It's not that.

00:30.027 --> 00:33.929
Police union's annual convention
is coming up next week.

00:33.932 --> 00:36.533
And you drew the short straw?
You have to ask the PC?

00:36.534 --> 00:37.600
No short straw, boss.

00:37.603 --> 00:39.301
The membership would
love to have you.

00:39.304 --> 00:41.804
Oh, come on, Sid, nobody wants
to invite the father-in-law

00:41.807 --> 00:43.039
to the bachelor party.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.341
They just think they should
and pray he says no.

00:45.344 --> 00:46.808
Boss, that's not how
the cops see you.

00:46.811 --> 00:49.845
We got the Grand Ballroom and
three floors of rooms on hold

00:49.847 --> 00:52.648
for the poker games
and after-parties and such.

00:52.649 --> 00:53.984
It's gonna be a blast.

00:53.985 --> 00:55.918
With, if memory
serves me correctly,

00:55.920 --> 00:57.853
a lot of foggy memories

so everybody's got
a little movie camera,

01:04.796 --> 01:06.796
so what happens
at those parties

01:06.798 --> 01:08.430
doesn't stay at
those parties anymore.

01:08.432 --> 01:09.831
My two cents?

01:09.834 --> 01:11.433
It's a recipe for disaster.

01:11.436 --> 01:12.668
Yeah, I know.

01:12.670 --> 01:14.670
All it takes is one guy
posting a cell phone video.

01:14.671 --> 01:16.237
The guys are
smarter than that.

01:16.239 --> 01:19.275
Common sense says we shouldn't
be having that party at all.

01:19.277 --> 01:20.275
Uh, but, boss...

01:20.277 --> 01:21.277
Well, I didn't say

01:21.278 --> 01:23.879
I was gonna use
common sense, Sid.

01:23.881 --> 01:25.847
Now, rest assured,
we've taken measures

01:25.849 --> 01:28.150
to tone down the wild
and woolier aspects.

01:28.152 --> 01:29.817
It is not like
the bad old days.

No, but you can report back
that you did your best.

01:38.694 --> 01:41.295
I'll just have Garrett
schedule some sort of conflict

01:41.298 --> 01:43.531
to give us both some cover.

01:43.533 --> 01:46.234
Good.

01:49.439 --> 01:53.408
Okay, before we go over
the facts of the case once more,

Dontrell Tariq will
go to prison because of this.

Yeah, well,
it won't bring my cousin back.

02:12.328 --> 02:13.661
No, it won't.

But it will bring justice to
his memory, and likely prevent

02:16.397 --> 02:20.000
another innocent life from
being taken by this sociopath.

He killed your cousin

a target on his head.

hard for.

On what grounds are you seeking

Look, the store's
security cameras

09:08.822 --> 09:12.090
that you be as specific as
possible with what you remember.

09:12.091 --> 09:15.027
I just got a glimpse really.

09:15.028 --> 09:17.995
And when he came in,
I hid in the back,

09:17.998 --> 09:21.765
but when he started shooting,
I must have panicked.

09:21.768 --> 09:23.634
I think I made a noise
or something

09:23.635 --> 09:26.403
because he came back there
looking for me.

09:26.405 --> 09:28.472
Okay, and what happened
when he found you?

09:28.475 --> 09:32.443
I said, "Please don't shoot."

09:32.446 --> 09:35.745
But he just...

09:35.748 --> 09:39.616
he just shot me and then ran.

09:39.619 --> 09:40.951
And then what happened?

09:40.953 --> 09:43.153
After he left, I called 911.

09:45.423 --> 09:48.592
Yeah, I thought
I was gonna die there.

09:48.595 --> 09:51.227
Okay, look, do you mind if
we send our sketch artist up

09:51.230 --> 09:53.529
to work with you and
see if we can't come up

09:53.532 --> 09:54.831
with a sketch
of this guy?

09:54.832 --> 09:56.899
Anything to help,
anything at all.

09:56.902 --> 09:58.067
All right.

09:58.070 --> 09:59.536
And thank you,

09:59.538 --> 10:01.370
Detectives.

10:01.373 --> 10:04.173
No, thank you.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.216
Remember you've got
the mayor at 4:00.

10:14.219 --> 10:15.518
Don't remind me.

10:19.725 --> 10:21.124
Hey, boss, how's it going?

10:21.125 --> 10:23.927
<b><font color="#ff8000">GARRETT:</font></b>
Having a good day?

10:23.928 --> 10:25.461
Am I having a good day?

10:25.462 --> 10:27.696
Yeah. How's it going?

10:27.697 --> 10:28.931
What are you up to?

10:28.932 --> 10:30.298
What makes you think
we're up to something?

10:30.301 --> 10:31.799
How many years
we work together?

10:31.802 --> 10:33.336
The six best
years of my life.

10:35.706 --> 10:37.273
Six years.

10:37.274 --> 10:40.442
And in all those six years,
have you ever asked me

10:40.445 --> 10:41.777
am I having a good day?

10:41.778 --> 10:43.611
I don't know.
I could've.

10:43.614 --> 10:46.248
Well, you wouldn't have lasted
six years.

10:46.250 --> 10:47.750
Right.

10:47.751 --> 10:49.350
Okay, I'd like to make
a suggestion.

10:49.352 --> 10:51.485
Then just make it.

10:51.488 --> 10:53.989
As your DCPI, it is
my professional recommendation

10:53.990 --> 10:55.724
that you attend
the police union party.

10:55.725 --> 10:58.326
I thought you were worried
about cell phone videos.

10:58.327 --> 10:59.293
I'm not, if you're there.

10:59.296 --> 11:01.395
What, chaperoning?

11:01.398 --> 11:03.130
No, joining in.

11:03.133 --> 11:05.399
Let's be honest,
there's a disconnect

11:05.402 --> 11:07.835
between the cops on the beat
and One PP.

11:07.836 --> 11:09.571
Yeah, it's called
a chain of command,

11:09.572 --> 11:11.773
and it exists
for a very good reason.

11:11.774 --> 11:13.441
As does the union bash.

11:13.442 --> 11:15.009
And how's that?

11:15.010 --> 11:18.011
Once a year, we put aside
the stripes and the rankings

11:18.014 --> 11:21.716
to bond together, just as
what we all started as: cops.

11:21.717 --> 11:23.884
Did you write that for him?

11:23.886 --> 11:24.719
No.

11:24.721 --> 11:27.187
Sounds more like you than him.

11:27.190 --> 11:29.057
I didn't write it, I just
said it because it's true.

11:29.058 --> 11:31.993
Okay, then, I tell you what.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.259
You go in my place.

11:33.261 --> 11:35.261
Well, I'm not sure
I can do that.

11:35.264 --> 11:36.263
Why not?

11:36.264 --> 11:38.065
I'm no you.

11:38.067 --> 11:40.767
I'm not asking you to be.
Just represent One PP.

11:40.769 --> 11:41.934
Really?

11:41.937 --> 11:45.673
What, it's okay for me to go,
but not you?

11:45.674 --> 11:49.109
Tell you what, come back when
you've thought this through.

11:57.686 --> 11:59.885
Afternoon, ma'am.

11:59.888 --> 12:02.923
I'm Investigator Abetemarco
from the D.A.'s office.

12:02.924 --> 12:05.692
Any chance Willis is here?

12:05.693 --> 12:06.926
Put that thing away.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.128
You're trying
to get somebody killed?

12:09.129 --> 12:10.263
Ma'am?

12:13.668 --> 12:14.966
Do you know what happens

12:14.969 --> 12:17.102
if those gangs see me
talking to a cop?

12:17.105 --> 12:20.405
Willis isn't here
and he's not gonna be here.

12:20.408 --> 12:22.807
And you best be getting
on your merry way.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.643
Just tell me where
I could find him.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.645
Take a left at Jupiter
and a right on Mars.

12:27.648 --> 12:30.081
Ma'am, all due respect,
I have a material witness order

12:30.083 --> 12:31.750
that says
he has to come with me.

12:31.753 --> 12:33.552
You people.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.453
You're always punishing
the wrong ones.

12:35.456 --> 12:37.456
My Willis
didn't do a damn thing.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.625
It's that animal, Tariq and his
crew out there killing people.

12:40.628 --> 12:42.894
Which is why it's important
for us to find your grandson.

12:42.895 --> 12:44.296
Don't you want Tariq
off the streets?

12:44.298 --> 12:48.366
Willis says one cross-eyed word
about Tariq in that courtroom,

12:48.369 --> 12:50.969
and he might as well be
shooting himself in the head.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.804
Mrs. Stratton, I understand
where you're coming from.

12:53.807 --> 12:54.873
No, you don't.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.573
That's just something
you people say.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.277
Of course, if you did,
if you really did,

12:59.278 --> 13:01.011
well, then you'd let
that boy be.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.580
That's not true.

13:02.581 --> 13:04.215
I do care about your grandson.

13:04.216 --> 13:07.485
Then why the hell you trying
to put him in an early grave?

13:09.322 --> 13:11.221
Excuse me for a sec.

13:15.827 --> 13:18.495
Hey, Erin, it's me.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.998
Look, uh,
it's a dead end here.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.234
Damn it.

13:24.235 --> 13:26.504
My phone just died.
Any chance I could borrow yours?

13:26.505 --> 13:28.504
Will it get you
the hell out of here?

13:28.506 --> 13:30.206
And a glass of water.

13:36.915 --> 13:38.748
Thanks.

Hi. It's me.

13:54.298 --> 13:56.264
No luck.

13:56.267 --> 13:58.134
I'm coming in.

13:58.135 --> 14:00.669
Thanks.

14:02.907 --> 14:05.041
You have a nice day.

14:08.578 --> 14:11.547
What'd you
come up with?

14:11.548 --> 14:12.948
<font color="#0CEC0C">(sighs)</font>

14:12.951 --> 14:15.217
Just the composite sketch
from Mr. Kaplan's description.

14:15.220 --> 14:16.284
Too generic.

14:16.287 --> 14:18.052
We could throw a rock
and hit that guy.

14:18.054 --> 14:20.755
Well, I ran a list of every
known felon within a mile radius

14:20.758 --> 14:21.756
of our liquor store.

14:21.759 --> 14:23.057
How many hits you get?

14:23.059 --> 14:24.393
Unfortunately, over 30.

14:24.394 --> 14:26.662
Okay.

14:26.663 --> 14:29.163
I'll put the sketch out
in the Finest Message,

14:29.166 --> 14:31.232
and every precinct
in the city will get it.

14:31.235 --> 14:32.868
Wait, hold your horses.
Why?

14:32.870 --> 14:35.135
Well, then I compared
those 30 arrest photos

14:35.138 --> 14:36.370
to our sketch.

14:36.373 --> 14:38.505
Morgan Rutherford.

14:38.508 --> 14:39.975
Pretty close, right?

14:39.976 --> 14:43.211
Close enough that we're gonna
have to have a talk with him.

14:44.681 --> 14:46.981
<font color="#FFFF00">(rock music playing,
quiet chatter)</font>

14:51.421 --> 14:54.522
Try not to look
so much like a cop.

14:54.524 --> 14:56.456
I'll do my best.

15:12.375 --> 15:13.572
How you doing?

15:15.510 --> 15:16.509
I don't see him.

15:16.511 --> 15:18.379
I don't either.

15:18.380 --> 15:19.947
You seen this guy around?

15:19.948 --> 15:22.982
You sure?

15:29.291 --> 15:30.791
Hold it!

15:30.793 --> 15:32.125
Hell no. No!

15:32.126 --> 15:33.158
Hey!

15:33.161 --> 15:34.461
No!

15:39.134 --> 15:40.033
No!

15:40.034 --> 15:42.168
Move! Hold it!
No!

15:44.605 --> 15:45.671
No!

15:57.518 --> 15:59.116
All right.

16:01.054 --> 16:02.587
Damn.

16:11.094 --> 16:12.692
I didn't do it.

16:12.695 --> 16:14.927
Oh, that's a new one.
Never heard that before.

16:14.929 --> 16:16.529
Yo, I ain't playing.
I didn't do it.

16:16.532 --> 16:17.498
You didn't do what?

16:17.500 --> 16:18.965
Whatever it is
you jumped me for.

16:18.966 --> 16:20.533
Then why'd you run?

16:20.536 --> 16:22.034
'Cause you was
looking for me.

16:22.037 --> 16:23.269
How'd you know that?

16:23.272 --> 16:26.572
I know what a cop look like
when he's looking.

16:26.575 --> 16:28.008
Listen,
if you didn't do nothing,

16:28.009 --> 16:29.342
you didn't have nothing
to worry about.

16:29.345 --> 16:30.442
<font color="#D900D9">(scoffs)</font>:
Oh, please.

16:30.445 --> 16:32.378
Black lives matter.
Excuse me?

16:32.379 --> 16:33.546
You heard me.

16:33.548 --> 16:34.980
No, I didn't hear you.

16:34.982 --> 16:37.582
I ran because every time a black
man gets stopped by a white cop,

16:37.585 --> 16:38.918
that ain't never gonna end well.

16:38.919 --> 16:41.586
That's funny,
'cause she's not a white cop.

16:41.588 --> 16:42.989
Cop period.

16:42.990 --> 16:44.990
So you running was
a political statement?

16:44.993 --> 16:46.259
Yeah, you could say that.

16:46.260 --> 16:47.225
You could also say that

16:47.227 --> 16:48.961
if you want to
sound like an idiot.

16:48.962 --> 16:50.062
Why you hassling me?

16:50.063 --> 16:53.599
I got a job, my own place,
doing things right.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.368
Were you in the liquor store

16:55.370 --> 16:57.202
on Riverside and Junction
yesterday morning?

16:57.205 --> 16:58.971
Nope.
Are you sure?

16:58.972 --> 17:00.839
'Cause it's just around the
corner from your place.

17:00.841 --> 17:02.408
It's got to be
your local spot.

17:02.409 --> 17:04.442
I know it, but I wasn't
in it yesterday morning.

17:04.443 --> 17:06.679
Then where was you
yesterday morning?

17:06.681 --> 17:08.945
With my parole officer.

17:09.983 --> 17:12.183
Call him up.

17:14.154 --> 17:15.353
<font color="#0CEC0C">(sighs)</font>

17:18.424 --> 17:21.125
I like to think
we're smart cops.

17:21.126 --> 17:22.492
You?

17:22.496 --> 17:23.493
Sure.

17:23.497 --> 17:27.265
But maybe not so smart
as we like to think.

17:27.267 --> 17:28.333
No?

17:28.335 --> 17:29.733
No.

17:29.736 --> 17:31.134
Is this going somewhere?

17:31.136 --> 17:32.703
The description
the Vic gave us

17:32.705 --> 17:35.038
was basically
generic male, black.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.340
We ran that against
other known felons,

17:37.343 --> 17:39.343
and surprise, surprise,
we got a hit.

17:39.345 --> 17:41.679
We took that,

17:41.681 --> 17:43.847
used it to track down
this Morgan Rutherford,

17:43.849 --> 17:45.648
an innocent man
at his place of work.

17:45.651 --> 17:47.984
An innocent man with
two felony priors.

17:47.987 --> 17:50.755
For which he
paid the price.

17:50.757 --> 17:51.855
So?

17:51.857 --> 17:54.758
So, we got a generic
description of a black guy

17:54.759 --> 17:56.125
right out of
central casting,

17:56.127 --> 17:57.627
and we bought it.

17:57.630 --> 18:00.096
But what if this guy gave us
a description of somebody

18:00.098 --> 18:02.065
more like himself?

18:02.067 --> 18:06.103
White, glasses, khakis,
loafers and a tweed jacket.

18:06.105 --> 18:07.738
We would've questioned it.

18:07.740 --> 18:09.839
You're damn straight
we would've questioned it.

18:09.842 --> 18:11.708
But some black guy in a hoodie
with sneakers,

18:11.710 --> 18:13.409
we just say,
"Oh, well, yeah, of course.

18:13.411 --> 18:14.978
He probably did it."

18:14.980 --> 18:17.380
Thinking back on it now,
yeah, it bumped a little.

18:17.382 --> 18:19.015
I can't help but think
we fell for something.

18:19.017 --> 18:20.450
But like what?

18:20.451 --> 18:23.920
Like we had our own unwitting
prejudices played against us.

18:23.922 --> 18:25.520
Maybe a little.

18:25.522 --> 18:26.489
Not maybe

18:26.490 --> 18:27.957
and not just a little, and not

18:27.959 --> 18:31.326
when you consider the fact
that this Joe Kaplan is making

18:31.328 --> 18:33.496
$50,000 a year,
he's in debt up to his ears,

18:33.498 --> 18:34.564
and his home is being

18:34.566 --> 18:36.766
foreclosed on.

18:36.768 --> 18:37.767
You know, it's just...

18:37.769 --> 18:40.502
it's sitting right here.

18:54.085 --> 18:55.584
Who is it?

18:55.586 --> 18:57.385
Open the door, Willis.

18:57.387 --> 19:00.288
It's me Willis.
Open up.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.192
No way, man.
I'm not going anywhere.

19:06.028 --> 19:07.328
I weigh 286 pounds.

19:07.330 --> 19:10.665
You really want me to put
all of that into this door?

19:10.667 --> 19:12.133
Come on, Anthony.
I didn't do anything.

19:12.134 --> 19:14.067
I'm not the bad guy here.
I know that.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.202
Then cut me some slack.

19:15.204 --> 19:16.403
You don't think
I want to do that?

19:16.405 --> 19:17.538
Well, then do it.

19:17.539 --> 19:19.273
<font color="#0CEC0C">(sighs)</font> I can't.

19:19.276 --> 19:20.107
Why not?

19:20.109 --> 19:21.209
'Cause I'm a cop,

19:21.211 --> 19:22.943
and this is a court order.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.648
You know what's gonna happen
if you take me in there,

19:28.651 --> 19:29.983
make me testify?

19:29.986 --> 19:31.984
They're gonna kill me, Anthony,
and not quick either.

19:31.987 --> 19:33.186
Look, we don't know that.

19:33.189 --> 19:35.323
Yes, you do.
Willis, I'm sorry.

19:35.325 --> 19:37.156
I wish there was
something I could do to help.

19:37.159 --> 19:38.258
Please.

19:38.259 --> 19:39.492
I got to do what I got to do.

19:39.494 --> 19:40.528
I'm begging you.

19:40.529 --> 19:42.195
<font color="#0CEC0C">(sighs)</font>
On the count of three,

19:42.198 --> 19:44.263
I'm coming
through that door.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.365
One.

19:45.367 --> 19:46.767
Two.

19:47.936 --> 19:48.936
Willis!

20:00.082 --> 20:02.682
Stop! Police!

20:18.500 --> 20:20.834
<font color="#D900D9">(panting)</font>

20:20.836 --> 20:22.868
I'm sorry, Willis.

20:22.871 --> 20:24.036
I really am.

20:42.122 --> 20:44.189
<font color="#0CEC0C">(elevator bell dings)</font>

20:44.191 --> 20:46.791
Boss, uh, I got
a favor to ask.

20:46.794 --> 20:49.227
Thanks, Jim. Shoot.

20:49.229 --> 20:50.528
You were right.

20:50.530 --> 20:53.064
I should represent
One PP at the party.

20:53.066 --> 20:55.767
But I checked with Sheila, and
unfortunately we have a conflict

20:55.769 --> 20:57.102
the night of
the union bash.

20:57.104 --> 20:58.903
Oh.
Yeah.

20:58.905 --> 20:59.871
Special occasion?

20:59.873 --> 21:01.471
Oh, yeah, real special.

21:01.473 --> 21:03.708
My guess is there's no way
Sheila's gonna reschedule

21:03.710 --> 21:04.942
something that special.

21:04.944 --> 21:07.545
God knows I tried, but she
reigns over that calendar

21:07.547 --> 21:09.881
like Charlemagne over
Constantinople.

21:09.883 --> 21:10.914
Yeah, I know.

21:10.916 --> 21:13.116
Mary was the same way.

21:13.118 --> 21:15.051
Called in every
chip I had.

21:15.054 --> 21:18.087
Baker, get Mrs. Gormley
on the phone.

21:18.089 --> 21:19.557
Wait, what?

21:19.558 --> 21:21.125
Let me give it a try.

21:21.126 --> 21:23.227
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, boss,
you can't do that.

21:23.229 --> 21:24.260
Abigail, please.

21:24.262 --> 21:26.262
Hang up.

21:28.401 --> 21:29.732
<font color="#0CEC0C">(sighs)</font>

21:36.909 --> 21:39.375
Sheila doesn't have a conflict.

21:39.377 --> 21:42.078
Boss, it's not that
I don't want to go.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.314
What, then?

21:43.316 --> 21:44.448
It's just that it's...

21:44.450 --> 21:47.182
it's not how it used to be
with the men.

21:47.184 --> 21:49.653
You find one day
your old drinking buddies

21:49.654 --> 21:53.388
are suddenly treating you
like you're the police.

21:53.391 --> 21:54.758
Something like that, yeah.

21:54.759 --> 21:56.025
Well, comes from working

21:56.027 --> 21:57.226
in this building.

21:57.228 --> 21:58.494
It's kind of
an occupational hazard.

21:58.497 --> 22:00.195
I know you know what
I'm talking about.

22:00.198 --> 22:01.963
Thank you, boss,
for understanding.

22:01.965 --> 22:04.598
May I suggest something, Sid?

22:04.601 --> 22:05.567
Please.

22:05.568 --> 22:07.734
That you get the hell
over yourself.

22:07.737 --> 22:09.737
Boss?
Just as it is your job

22:09.739 --> 22:12.640
to be the voice of
the street cop in my ear,

22:12.642 --> 22:15.009
it is equally
your responsibility

22:15.011 --> 22:17.612
to represent this office
to them.

22:17.614 --> 22:18.813
Yes, sir.

22:21.183 --> 22:22.584
I'll be there.

22:22.586 --> 22:24.551
Thank you.

22:24.554 --> 22:26.220
That's that, then.

22:40.169 --> 22:42.036
You know, this isn't fair.

22:42.038 --> 22:43.836
What you guys
are doing is wrong.

22:43.838 --> 22:47.441
What we are doing is
painful and difficult for you.

22:47.442 --> 22:49.076
I understand that.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.743
But I'm hoping
that you will come around

22:50.746 --> 22:53.046
to see that it's something
that I have to do.

22:53.048 --> 22:54.180
You keep saying that,

22:54.182 --> 22:55.715
but you don't
<i>have</i> to do anything.

22:55.718 --> 22:56.950
I'm not the bad guy here.

22:56.951 --> 22:58.885
I know you're not.

22:58.887 --> 23:00.452
I'm hoping this will
make you feel better.

23:00.454 --> 23:02.522
It's a signed letter
of authorization

23:02.525 --> 23:03.923
from the district attorney
himself

23:03.925 --> 23:06.593
granting witness protection
for you and your family.

23:06.595 --> 23:09.628
All you have to do is
pick a location on the map,

23:09.631 --> 23:11.696
and we will relocate you.

23:14.001 --> 23:17.470
But-but my life is here.

23:17.471 --> 23:19.271
And my-my grandmother
is 62 years old.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.673
You want us to
give up our names

23:21.675 --> 23:24.076
and friends and everything
we've ever known

23:24.078 --> 23:26.645
to move somewhere in
the middle of nowhere.

23:26.647 --> 23:28.079
This is a good offer, Willis.

23:28.082 --> 23:29.147
For you.

23:29.150 --> 23:32.384
You get to win your case
and keep your home.

23:32.385 --> 23:34.787
This is the right thing to do,
and you know it.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.322
Tariq is
incredibly dangerous,

23:37.324 --> 23:39.858
and you're the only one who can
get him off the streets.

23:39.861 --> 23:41.960
Yeah, but don't put that
all on me.

23:41.961 --> 23:43.228
I'm not a cop.

23:43.230 --> 23:45.029
I'm not a lawyer like you.

23:45.031 --> 23:46.631
I'm just a guy
who's seen something

23:46.633 --> 23:47.832
that he shouldn't have seen.

23:47.834 --> 23:48.967
That's right.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.902
And then you told
the grand jury what you saw,

23:50.903 --> 23:53.038
because you want to end
the senseless killing

23:53.039 --> 23:54.638
in your neighborhood.
My family...

23:54.641 --> 23:57.241
I'm just asking you
to finish what you started.

24:02.950 --> 24:04.248
No.

24:04.250 --> 24:07.919
Willis,
the material witness order

24:07.921 --> 24:10.922
says I can hold you in jail
till the time of the trial.

24:10.923 --> 24:14.258
Well, a cell beats a coffin.

24:14.259 --> 24:16.826
Willis, please.

24:16.828 --> 24:18.261
I'm begging you.

24:18.263 --> 24:21.231
And I'm begging <i> you.</i>

24:26.472 --> 24:29.440
Officers, take him away.

<font color="#0CEC0C">(handcuffs clicking)</font>

24:52.029 --> 24:54.564

25:11.493 --> 25:13.993
Excuse me.

25:13.996 --> 25:15.395
Hey.

25:15.397 --> 25:17.597
Danny. What are
you doing here?

25:17.599 --> 25:22.269
Well, I was on my way home,
and I was passing by Elio's,

25:22.270 --> 25:25.005
and I thought I'd bring you
a little surprise.

25:25.007 --> 25:26.807
<font color="#D900D9">(gasps)</font>
Ooh, chicken francese.

25:26.808 --> 25:29.675
Oh, with the sauce on the side
just the way you like it.

25:29.678 --> 25:31.010
Thank you.
You're welcome.

25:31.012 --> 25:33.113
Uh, do you have a second
I can talk to you?

25:33.115 --> 25:35.449
Yeah. Is it about the kids?
You're making me nervous.

25:35.451 --> 25:37.584
It's not about the kids.
Don't be nervous.

25:37.586 --> 25:40.920
It's about the shooting victim
in there, Joseph Kaplan.

25:40.922 --> 25:42.855
Yeah, what about him?

25:42.857 --> 25:44.123
Has he been behaving
strangely at all?

25:44.125 --> 25:45.424
No.

25:45.426 --> 25:48.161
I mean, a couple of the nurses,
we feel sorry for him

25:48.163 --> 25:49.127
'cause nobody's visited him.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.564
Not even his wife?

25:50.566 --> 25:52.065
Guess he's not
as lucky as you.

25:52.067 --> 25:54.299
Well, nobody's as lucky as me.
Good answer.

25:54.301 --> 25:56.434
Okay, but let me
ask you a question though.

25:56.436 --> 25:57.702
If I were to get shot,

25:57.704 --> 25:59.905
what would it take
for you to not visit me?

25:59.907 --> 26:02.008
<font color="#D900D9">(laughs)</font> Come on.

26:02.009 --> 26:03.276
I'm serious.

26:03.278 --> 26:05.077
It would have
to be something

26:05.079 --> 26:08.280
crazy-crazy, like the
worst of the worst.

26:08.282 --> 26:09.448
Like robbing a liquor store?

26:09.450 --> 26:11.950
What are you saying?
That he was involved?

26:11.951 --> 26:13.151
But somebody shot him.

26:13.153 --> 26:14.386
Maybe.

26:14.388 --> 26:17.455
Or maybe he heard a half dozen
police sirens approaching,

26:17.458 --> 26:20.593
got nervous, shot himself so
he could look like the victim.

26:20.595 --> 26:22.928
Well, you're giving him
a pretty big set of balls.

26:22.930 --> 26:24.195
He's a high school
science teacher.

26:24.198 --> 26:26.230
He's a high school
science teacher

26:26.232 --> 26:28.066
with a master's in anatomy.

26:28.067 --> 26:31.603
Meaning he would know
exactly where to shoot himself

26:31.605 --> 26:33.637
for maximum impact
with limited damage.

26:33.640 --> 26:34.672
Right.

26:34.673 --> 26:35.740
Now, you're a nurse.

26:35.741 --> 26:37.910
Could that be
a self-inflicted gunshot wound?

26:37.912 --> 26:39.411
<font color="#0CEC0C">(sighs)</font>

26:39.413 --> 26:41.479
I'm not a doctor, Danny.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.782
You've changed more bandages
than any doctor I've ever met.

26:44.785 --> 26:46.817
<font color="#0CEC0C">(sighs)</font>

26:46.819 --> 26:49.220
I don't know.

26:49.221 --> 26:50.988
Maybe. I mean, hypothetically.

26:50.990 --> 26:51.989
Uh-huh.

26:51.990 --> 26:53.356
Well, what about the gun?

26:53.358 --> 26:54.392
Wouldn't it be at the scene?

26:54.394 --> 26:55.660
I mean, it's not like he came

26:55.662 --> 26:57.994
waltzing in here
carrying it.

26:57.997 --> 26:59.163
Son of a bitch.

26:59.164 --> 27:01.298
What?

27:01.300 --> 27:05.068
I think that might be
exactly what he did.

27:09.308 --> 27:11.575
<font color="#D900D9">(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)</font>

27:14.747 --> 27:16.547
Hey, Joe. How you feeling?

27:16.548 --> 27:17.847
Detective.

27:17.849 --> 27:19.883
Um, okay, I guess.

27:19.884 --> 27:21.384
Good. Glad to hear it.

27:21.385 --> 27:23.921
Hey, I was wondering if there's
anything you could recall

27:23.923 --> 27:26.122
about the perp
that might help us.

27:26.124 --> 27:27.490
Geez, uh...

27:27.492 --> 27:29.159
I'm sorry,
but what I told you is

27:29.161 --> 27:31.161
pretty much all I remember.
The whole thing happened

27:31.163 --> 27:33.195
crazy fast.

27:33.198 --> 27:34.497
Of course. Okay.

27:34.499 --> 27:36.365
Well, if you think of anything,
you'll let us know.

27:36.367 --> 27:37.866
Of course.
Oh.

27:37.868 --> 27:40.302
Uh, actually, uh...

27:40.305 --> 27:41.371
I did forget one thing.

27:41.373 --> 27:44.507
In all the chaos
of what was going on,

27:44.509 --> 27:47.710
I forgot to voucher your bag as
evidence from the crime scene.

27:47.711 --> 27:49.445
What?

27:49.448 --> 27:51.212
I have to take your bag.

27:51.214 --> 27:52.280
Uh, no.

27:52.282 --> 27:54.316
Um, I mean,
that's my personal bag.

27:54.317 --> 27:55.585
Why would that be
considered evidence?

27:55.586 --> 27:57.152
Well, we take everything
that we find at a crime scene.

27:57.153 --> 28:00.288
Yeah, I think I'll hang on
to it, just for now.

28:00.290 --> 28:01.590
Pretty heavy.

28:01.593 --> 28:03.925
What do you got in here,
a rock collection or something?

28:03.928 --> 28:05.094
Detective!

28:05.096 --> 28:07.128
You and I both know
you cannot open that bag

28:07.131 --> 28:09.830
without my consent
or a search warrant.

28:09.833 --> 28:12.634
Warrant?

28:12.635 --> 28:14.568
Thought we're on
the same side here, Joe.

28:14.570 --> 28:16.872
We are.

28:16.874 --> 28:18.940
But please put the bag down.

28:18.942 --> 28:21.942
Okay.

28:24.314 --> 28:26.580
You remember, Joe,

28:26.583 --> 28:28.916
when you told me
that you'd do anything possible

28:28.919 --> 28:30.784
to find the animal who did this?

28:30.786 --> 28:32.219
Yeah.

28:32.221 --> 28:34.922
Well, so would I.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.300
He did it, Erin.

28:48.302 --> 28:50.302
You don't know that.
Of course I do.

28:50.305 --> 28:51.837
He wouldn't even
let me open the bag

28:51.839 --> 28:52.872
without a search warrant.

28:52.874 --> 28:54.641
He's 100% right;
you can't.

28:54.643 --> 28:56.209
Yeah, but innocent people
don't think that way.

28:56.211 --> 28:58.211
You don't know why he didn't
want you to go through his bags.

28:58.212 --> 29:00.247
Of course I do--
because he had a gun in it!

29:00.249 --> 29:02.182
Maybe it was
a bag of weed.

29:02.183 --> 29:04.282
The bag had weight,
but not that kind of weight.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.818
Or maybe, like most people,
he doesn't want cops

29:06.820 --> 29:09.087
going through his personal
belongings on general principle.

29:09.089 --> 29:11.523
Everything points to him.

29:11.526 --> 29:13.125
But it's circumstantial
and you know it.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.193
When you have real evidence
that points in his direction,

29:15.195 --> 29:16.494
I'll give you a search warrant.

29:16.497 --> 29:18.964
You know what, maybe I'll just
go over your head.

29:18.967 --> 29:20.165
Good luck with that.

29:20.167 --> 29:21.967
The Founding Fathers are dead.

29:25.038 --> 29:26.337
Hi.

29:26.339 --> 29:27.573
We got a problem.

29:27.575 --> 29:28.874
What now?

29:28.875 --> 29:30.041
These idiots in corrections,

29:30.044 --> 29:32.877
they put Willis in a cell
right next to Tariq.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.313
Oh.

29:34.315 --> 29:36.448
Y-You got to call
up there, you know?

29:36.450 --> 29:38.148
Get him moved right away.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.919
Okay.

29:40.921 --> 29:42.287
Erin.

29:42.288 --> 29:44.556
You got to do it now.

29:44.557 --> 29:47.224
Yeah, I can't do that, Anthony.

29:47.227 --> 29:49.861
Of course you can. You're the
A.D.A. They'll listen to you.

29:49.863 --> 29:54.632
I'm the one who instructed them
to place Willis next to Tariq.

29:54.634 --> 29:57.134
What? Are you out of your mind?!

29:57.136 --> 29:59.471
Do you know what Tariq's
gonna do to this poor kid?

29:59.472 --> 30:01.172
It's one night.

30:01.173 --> 30:03.307
Tariq is behind bars
the entire time.

30:03.309 --> 30:05.143
He can't put a finger on Willis.

30:05.144 --> 30:07.345
No, but he could scare him
half to death

30:07.346 --> 30:09.246
and threaten him within
an inch of his life.

30:09.248 --> 30:10.748
Come on, Erin!

30:10.750 --> 30:12.817
Willis is one of the good ones.
Don't you think I know that?

30:12.818 --> 30:14.585
So why don't you start
treating him like one?

30:14.586 --> 30:15.586
Cut him loose!

30:15.587 --> 30:17.887
Absolutely not.
Why not?

30:17.890 --> 30:20.924
Because, Anthony, my job
is to get a dangerous killer

30:20.926 --> 30:23.460
off the streets, and sometimes,
in order to do that,

30:23.461 --> 30:24.996
you have to play
a little hardball.

30:24.998 --> 30:26.596
But don't, for a second,

30:26.598 --> 30:28.397
think that I'm enjoying this.

30:28.400 --> 30:32.236
Yeah, well,
that makes two of us.

30:32.238 --> 30:34.037
<font color="#0CEC0C">(sighs)</font>

30:39.010 --> 30:41.577
I don't want to bury
the headline here.

30:41.579 --> 30:44.180
I'm canceling this year's
police union party.

30:44.182 --> 30:45.580
What?
What?

30:45.583 --> 30:46.750
Afraid so.

30:46.751 --> 30:47.817
Why?

30:47.818 --> 30:49.118
Garrett's right.

30:49.121 --> 30:51.788
With everyone packing a camera,
the risk is too high.

30:51.789 --> 30:53.757
You're well aware of
the anti-police sentiment

30:53.759 --> 30:55.892
we're battling against.

30:55.894 --> 30:58.861
It's a party, not
a public hearing.

30:58.863 --> 31:02.265
Sid, Johnny,
this is on me, not him.

31:02.267 --> 31:03.965
I made the decision on my own.

31:03.968 --> 31:05.733
I can't believe this.

31:05.736 --> 31:06.934
Well, believe it.

31:06.936 --> 31:08.136
Frank, it's not a good idea...

31:08.138 --> 31:09.638
Frank?

31:09.641 --> 31:11.839
I'm sorry.

31:11.842 --> 31:12.941
Boss, you can't do this.

31:12.942 --> 31:14.143
I just did.

31:14.144 --> 31:15.743
It's a mistake.
Says you.

31:15.746 --> 31:19.413
Boss, those cops look forward
to this night all year.

31:19.415 --> 31:21.182
You take this away from them,

31:21.184 --> 31:23.417
it'll have lasting effects,
bad ones.

31:23.420 --> 31:24.352
They'll get over it.

31:24.354 --> 31:25.420
No, they won't.

31:25.422 --> 31:26.922
They'll have to.

31:26.923 --> 31:29.124
And then you'll have to deal
with the low morale,

31:29.125 --> 31:32.093
decreased performance,
and a disgruntled work force

31:32.095 --> 31:34.296
as a direct result
of this decision.

31:34.298 --> 31:35.163
He's right, Commissioner.

31:35.164 --> 31:37.030
<b><font color="#ff8000">GORMLEY:</font></b>
Boss, please, please.

31:37.032 --> 31:38.599
Reconsider.

31:38.602 --> 31:40.701
Fair trade.

31:40.703 --> 31:42.903
If I reconsider,
and the answer is the same,

31:42.905 --> 31:44.573
which is highly likely,

31:44.575 --> 31:46.907
I won't get any pushback
from either of you,

31:46.910 --> 31:48.108
not a word.

31:48.111 --> 31:49.943
Three, two, one.

31:49.945 --> 31:50.644
Agreed.

31:50.645 --> 31:51.746
Johnny?

31:51.748 --> 31:53.013
Okay.

31:53.016 --> 31:54.882
Good.

31:54.884 --> 31:56.817

32:14.604 --> 32:16.970
Checking out early, huh?

32:16.971 --> 32:18.771
Yeah, yeah,
I'm feeling much better.

32:18.773 --> 32:19.873
Good.

32:19.875 --> 32:22.142
Uh, is Mrs. Kaplan gonna be
picking you up?

32:22.144 --> 32:24.044
I'm afraid she's busy.

32:24.046 --> 32:26.712
Well, how about I give you
a ride back in my squad car?

32:26.714 --> 32:28.347
Thanks, but, uh...

32:28.349 --> 32:30.049
I'm okay. <font color="#D900D9">(clears throat)</font>

32:30.051 --> 32:32.251
Actually, can't let
you leave just yet.

32:32.253 --> 32:34.820
We got an anonymous tip

32:34.823 --> 32:35.989
that there's an explosive device

32:35.990 --> 32:37.356
planted somewhere
in the hospital,

32:37.358 --> 32:40.692
so we have to wait
for ESU and their dogs

32:40.694 --> 32:43.028
to conduct a thorough
search of the premises.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.430
You know, Detective,

32:44.432 --> 32:47.066
I'm starting to feel like you
maybe have a problem with me.

32:47.067 --> 32:48.200
Okay, I need to go.

32:48.201 --> 32:49.167
Is it 'cause, as a scientist,

32:49.170 --> 32:52.104
you know that
a bomb-sniffing dog

32:52.105 --> 32:53.740
is also gonna be able to
sniff out the nine-millimeter

32:53.741 --> 32:54.839

32:54.842 --> 32:57.342

33:07.020 --> 33:09.520
All right.

33:09.522 --> 33:10.689
Am I free to go?

33:10.691 --> 33:14.625
Yeah, you're free to go.

33:22.469 --> 33:24.635
Damn it.

33:24.637 --> 33:25.671
No gun?

33:25.673 --> 33:27.070
How'd you guess?

33:27.073 --> 33:28.739
I don't think
he was working alone.

33:28.740 --> 33:29.840
Take a look at these.

33:29.843 --> 33:30.974
Took a closer look

33:30.977 --> 33:32.143
at the Kaplans'
itemized credit card bills.

33:32.144 --> 33:37.115
Atlantic City,
Atlantic City, Atlan...

33:37.116 --> 33:38.449
Everything's in Atlantic City.

Mrs. Kaplan

33:40.119 --> 33:42.420

34:07.712 --> 34:09.346
Would you look at that.

34:09.347 --> 34:10.612
That's some bandage.

34:10.614 --> 34:12.849
You know, I'd say that's
the kind of bandage

34:12.851 --> 34:16.085
you'd end up with if you broke
a glass countertop.

34:16.088 --> 34:18.286
No wonder she didn't come
visit him in the hospital.

34:18.289 --> 34:19.889
We'd better double-check
the blood samples,

34:19.891 --> 34:22.759
see if we can't put her
at the crime scene, too.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.070
I know you're busy.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.436
I'll just be a minute.

34:35.438 --> 34:39.007
No, come in, sit down.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.277
What is this?

34:41.277 --> 34:42.744
You know, you're
great at what you do

34:42.746 --> 34:44.280
because you'll do
anything for the win.

34:44.282 --> 34:45.447
I'm just not built that way.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.282
Anthony, what is this?

34:47.284 --> 34:48.985
I'm resigning from your detail.

34:48.987 --> 34:51.286

34:51.288 --> 34:52.987

35:20.985 --> 35:23.552
Sorry to disturb your lunch.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.206
By all means, take a seat.

35:25.208 --> 35:26.440
I'll pass.

35:26.443 --> 35:29.610
I just wanted to come by
and let you know the good news.

35:29.612 --> 35:30.612
We got the killer.

35:30.614 --> 35:32.313
Oh, really?

35:32.315 --> 35:35.349
Don't you want to know
who did it?

35:35.351 --> 35:38.552
Right, yeah.

35:38.554 --> 35:39.655
Who is it?

35:39.657 --> 35:42.123
Well, if you just take a look
over there,

35:42.125 --> 35:43.425
turn around,

35:43.427 --> 35:45.092
my partner has her in
handcuffs right now.

35:45.094 --> 35:46.994
You see that?

35:46.996 --> 35:48.929
We found her blood
at the crime scene,

35:48.931 --> 35:50.965
and it was a perfect DNA match.

35:50.967 --> 35:53.335
<font color="#0CEC0C">(sighs)</font>

35:53.336 --> 35:55.304
I... I can explain.

35:55.306 --> 35:57.271
It's okay, she already did.

35:57.273 --> 35:59.139
You're up to your gizzards in debt,
you're underwater on your house.

35:59.141 --> 36:01.574
You thought you could
take a shortcut,

36:01.577 --> 36:02.876
then the clerk pulled out a gun,

36:02.878 --> 36:04.244
she panicked and blasted him.

36:04.246 --> 36:06.380
It was me,
it was, it was all me.

36:06.382 --> 36:07.981
She had nothing to do with it.

36:07.983 --> 36:09.483
Well, I think
it's the other way around.

36:09.485 --> 36:12.853
She's a gambler, and as usual,
her bet didn't pay off.

36:12.856 --> 36:14.289
Please take me.

36:14.291 --> 36:16.657
Just put this all on me
and let her go.

36:16.659 --> 36:19.760
Oh, we're gonna take you, too.

36:19.762 --> 36:22.228
I mean, once you took a bullet
for her and passed off

36:22.231 --> 36:24.465
that BS story about a big,
scary, black guy,

36:24.467 --> 36:28.001
well, kind of made you
an accessory to a homicide.

36:28.003 --> 36:29.570
Now turn your ass around.

36:50.791 --> 36:53.726
Yes, I am.

36:53.728 --> 36:56.862
I want to show you something.

36:56.864 --> 36:59.097
I'm kind of busy here, Erin.

36:59.099 --> 37:00.900
It will only take a minute.

37:00.902 --> 37:01.867
That I don't have.

37:01.869 --> 37:05.271
Anthony, just watch it.

37:08.442 --> 37:11.143
You know what's gonna happen
if you rat me out.

37:11.144 --> 37:13.811
The exact same thing
you saw me to do to your cuz.

37:13.813 --> 37:16.648
Two in the head,
one in the nuts.

37:16.650 --> 37:18.583
Why the hell would you
want to show me that?

37:18.585 --> 37:19.717
That's a good thing.

37:19.719 --> 37:20.918
How?

37:20.920 --> 37:23.422
Tariq incriminates himself.

37:23.423 --> 37:25.757
He confesses to a murder
and he threatens a witness.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.659
We can use this?

37:27.661 --> 37:29.159
Already have.

37:29.161 --> 37:31.996
Showed it to the defense and to
the judge earlier this morning,

37:31.998 --> 37:36.300
Tariq is getting 25 years.

37:36.302 --> 37:38.469
That's...

37:38.471 --> 37:39.371
that's fantastic.

37:39.373 --> 37:42.373
Yes, it is.
And Willis?

37:42.376 --> 37:44.208
Willis gets to go
back to his life

37:44.210 --> 37:45.476
as if nothing ever happened.

37:45.478 --> 37:48.313
And because he didn't
cooperate with us,

37:48.315 --> 37:50.315
he's in no danger
with Tariq or his gang.

37:50.317 --> 37:52.516
You set this whole thing up,
didn't you?

37:52.518 --> 37:55.985
Sometimes my job is
like a game of chess,

37:55.987 --> 37:57.889
and I need to be
five moves ahead.

37:57.891 --> 38:00.425
So you were never going
to make Willis testify?

38:00.427 --> 38:01.692
Never.

38:01.693 --> 38:03.628
So why didn't you
just tell me that?

38:03.630 --> 38:05.596
I needed you to believe it,

38:05.597 --> 38:07.565
so that Willis and Tariq
believed it.

38:07.567 --> 38:11.867
Like I said, nobody plays
harder hardball than you.

38:11.869 --> 38:15.172
Anthony, you were right.

38:15.173 --> 38:18.409
I would do almost anything
for a conviction

38:18.411 --> 38:21.644
and I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

38:21.646 --> 38:24.847
But I will make you a promise.

38:24.849 --> 38:26.916
If you stay,

38:26.918 --> 38:29.251
I will never keep you
in the dark again.

38:34.592 --> 38:36.626
You swear it?

38:36.628 --> 38:38.961
On whatever you name.

39:00.184 --> 39:01.884
Hey, it's almost 6:00.

39:01.885 --> 39:02.985
Shouldn't you boys be going?

39:02.987 --> 39:04.786
What time does
the party start?

39:04.789 --> 39:05.688
8:00.

39:05.690 --> 39:07.523
But they want to pregame.

39:07.525 --> 39:08.757
What is a pregame?

39:08.759 --> 39:10.559
It's a party before the party.

39:10.561 --> 39:11.827
Are you going, too, Mom?

39:11.829 --> 39:14.730
No, this is a party
for cops only.

39:14.731 --> 39:16.264
Are you going?

39:16.266 --> 39:17.632
No, I'm past my prime.

Oh, not this year, Jack.

39:23.739 --> 39:25.739
Or any year since you became PC.

39:25.742 --> 39:27.242
You keeping score?

39:27.244 --> 39:29.710
There was a time that you
were the life of that party,

39:29.713 --> 39:30.811
so the legend has it.

39:30.813 --> 39:34.315
I loved those parties.

39:34.317 --> 39:38.284
But that was literally
in the last century, so...

39:38.286 --> 39:39.521
But you were invited, right?

39:39.523 --> 39:41.155
Well, out of protocol, sure,

39:41.157 --> 39:43.525
but, uh, tonight's
for the rank and file.

39:43.527 --> 39:44.958
Nobody wants the
hall monitor showing up.

39:44.960 --> 39:48.329
Oh, that's not how
the guys see you.

39:48.331 --> 39:50.231
Yeah, I used to be
one of the guys,

39:50.233 --> 39:51.164
I know how they see the PC.

39:51.166 --> 39:52.298
You know, rumor has it

39:52.300 --> 39:53.666
this party almost didn't happen.

39:53.668 --> 39:54.719
Oh?

39:54.719 --> 39:56.260
Yeah, word is,
you were gonna cancel it,

39:56.262 --> 39:57.371
but Lieutenant Gormley stood up,

39:57.373 --> 39:58.472
convinced you
to change your mind.

39:58.474 --> 39:59.907
Is that a fact?

39:59.909 --> 40:00.940
That's the word on the street.

40:00.943 --> 40:02.742
Is it true?

40:02.744 --> 40:05.112
You guys better get going.

40:05.114 --> 40:07.079
Come on, Dad.
Come with us.

40:07.081 --> 40:08.514
Yeah, Dad, come on.

40:08.516 --> 40:10.684
I get word the party's
out of hand,

40:10.686 --> 40:14.420
I'll shut it down forthwith,
so you guys better get going

40:14.422 --> 40:16.322
before somebody tips off
the commissioner.

40:16.324 --> 40:18.458
Come on.

40:19.527 --> 40:21.161
Have fun.

40:36.978 --> 40:41.880

40:41.882 --> 40:44.115

40:44.117 --> 40:48.454
My spies say the bash
is "off the hook."

40:48.456 --> 40:49.722
What's that mean?

40:49.724 --> 40:51.657
You don't know
that expression?

40:51.659 --> 40:53.157
No, does it mean
out of hand?

40:53.159 --> 40:54.152
Kind of.

40:54.177 --> 40:55.795
Well, then I don't
want to know about it.

40:55.795 --> 40:57.463
Why not?
Because if I know about it,

40:57.465 --> 40:59.264
I got to do something about it.

40:59.266 --> 41:00.431
Think, Garrett.

41:00.434 --> 41:03.469
I'm on to you, you know.

41:05.106 --> 41:07.038
There's no way you were ever
gonna cancel that party.

41:07.039 --> 41:09.407
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.

41:09.409 --> 41:13.077
'Cause, one: it'd mean
you'd have taken my advice,

41:13.079 --> 41:15.413
two: it was never
about the party,

41:15.414 --> 41:17.280
it was about managing Sid
for your own ends.

41:17.282 --> 41:19.884
This is going
right over my head.

41:19.885 --> 41:21.418
No, it's not.

41:21.420 --> 41:22.820
With Lyons in the room,

41:22.822 --> 41:25.690
Sid stands up to you
for the men to get their party,

41:25.692 --> 41:29.626
word of this gets out,
Sid's the rank and file's hero.

41:29.628 --> 41:31.061
What's in it for me?

41:31.063 --> 41:34.030
He's your eyes and ears
in the precinct, on the beat.

41:34.032 --> 41:36.434
They believe he's still one
of them, it's a win for you.

41:36.436 --> 41:40.637
And maybe I just really didn't
want to go to that party,

41:40.639 --> 41:41.871
you think of that?

41:41.873 --> 41:45.876
And maybe the best part is,
Sid got to be the hero

41:45.878 --> 41:48.210
because you played the bad guy.

41:48.213 --> 41:50.213
You fell on your sword in this.

41:52.351 --> 41:54.284
I thought we were drinking here.

41:54.286 --> 41:57.755
Drinking to the streak in you
that, no matter the cost,

41:57.757 --> 42:00.923
can't help but try
and give a guy a break.

42:02.414 --> 42:05.315
Nobody's perfect.
