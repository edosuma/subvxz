SAM: <i> Previously on</i> Aquarius...

00:06.640 --> 00:08.874
<i> I think Roy Kovic</i>
<i> had Guapo killed.</i>

00:08.876 --> 00:10.442
Where were you
last Tuesday night, Roy?

00:10.444 --> 00:13.345
Mrs. Gladner, I can't imagine
how scared you are.

00:13.347 --> 00:13.912
I want to make a deal.

00:13.914 --> 00:18.217
Use of deadly force,
lying under oath, coercion,
drunk and disorderly.

00:18.219 --> 00:21.754
I am amazed that
you're even still a policeman.

00:21.756 --> 00:22.454
Everybody's doing the funny.

00:22.456 --> 00:25.991
CHARMAIN: Tina Greenwood,
reported missing
right after Thanksgiving.

00:25.993 --> 00:26.658
SAM: It's the same girl.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.627
You know
what the dream is, right?

00:28.629 --> 00:29.695
Of course.

00:29.697 --> 00:30.295
Your music.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.296
EMMA: <i> Wait, you know</i>
<i> Dennis Wilson?</i>

00:31.298 --> 00:34.400
PATTY: <i> It's a crazy scene.</i>
<i> A party that never stops.</i>

00:34.402 --> 00:36.035
Charlie's gonna love it here.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.299
TEX: How!

01:08.235 --> 01:09.468
Hey.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.203
What's going on?

01:13.374 --> 01:14.740
Hi, friend.

01:17.078 --> 01:20.412
Ow! Hey, get off!
Get off me! Hey, get...

01:20.414 --> 01:22.147
(GROANING)

01:24.385 --> 01:25.617
Stop!

01:25.786 --> 01:27.719
(PANTING)

01:29.590 --> 01:30.856
Don't.

01:32.726 --> 01:33.459
SADIE: Get it done, Tex.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.828
MAN: I'm not gonna
tell anybody.
Please, just don't.

01:35.830 --> 01:38.297
Please don't.
Don't. Don't, please.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.531
Don't.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.955
(LAUGHING)

02:07.962 --> 02:11.130
Hey, is that
a Rolls-Royce there?

02:11.599 --> 02:13.699
Silver Shadow. Yes, sir.

02:14.001 --> 02:16.902
Got a problem with the idle.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.171
I'm adjusting the linkage.
You know cars?

02:19.173 --> 02:21.673
I appreciate people who do.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.742
You from Texas, huh?
Whereabouts?

02:23.744 --> 02:29.181
Good ear, man. Copeville.
Just outside of Dallas.
You been to Texas?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.850
CHARLIE: I've been everywhere.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.154
Let me guess. Football player.

02:35.656 --> 02:40.225
Yeah,
two-year honorable mention,
all-district running back.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.194
You know anything about guns?

02:42.196 --> 02:43.996
Sure. Me and my Daddy
used to go...

02:43.998 --> 02:46.899
What about motorcycles?
You like motorcycles?

02:47.434 --> 02:48.433
Um...

02:48.435 --> 02:50.636
I'm kind of more
of a truck guy.

02:52.106 --> 02:55.574
I guess I could probably
fix up a hog
if it came down to it.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.042
It won't.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.244
What's your name, friend?

02:59.947 --> 03:01.513
Charles Watson.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.050
Yeah, that don't work.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.986
I'ma call you Tex.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.957
(CHUCKLES) All right, then.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.393
-Morning.
-Hey.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.794
How's it going?

03:15.930 --> 03:18.230
I got this Jane Doe body
in Canoga Park

03:18.232 --> 03:20.432
that looks like
my missing picture girl,
but isn't,

03:20.434 --> 03:23.135
and the Canoga Park sheriffs
have told me to get bent.

03:23.137 --> 03:26.538
And it seems like
I should be able to leverage
this Captain Welles thing

03:26.540 --> 03:28.941
with the Army to try to get
Walt some rhythm somehow,

03:28.943 --> 03:31.376
but I haven't been able
to figure out how exactly yet.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.412
You sorry you asked?
Because I could go on.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.048
Leverage it? We don't even
know what "it" is yet.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.116
That's the best time
to strong-arm somebody.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.018
Before they know
what they're dealing with.

03:40.020 --> 03:43.288
And don't worry.
Whatever I decide to do,
I will leave you out of it.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.523
You don't have to
worry about me.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.559
Look at you, all cute
and irrationally confident,

03:47.561 --> 03:50.329
and very close to the milk,
which I forgot.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.231
-Can you grab that?
-(CLEARS THROAT)

03:52.233 --> 03:54.866
That better not be
what it looks like.

03:54.868 --> 03:58.437
I said, "Anyone delivers
anything for me,
you grab them."

03:58.439 --> 04:01.006
Didn't I say that,
you sweaty-necked jackass?

04:01.008 --> 04:02.674
There wasn't
anyone to grab, sir.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.443
-Lindenoff found it
on the stoop out front.
-Oh.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.913
We thought that maybe
whoever it was that left it,
left it on purpose

04:07.915 --> 04:10.816
-so we wouldn't get
a look at them.
-Oh, you did, did you?

04:10.818 --> 04:14.319
Well, did you think that
maybe I could have
pulled some prints off of this

04:14.321 --> 04:18.056
before you and Lindenoff
put your big hams all over it?

04:18.626 --> 04:21.026
No one ever talks about
how exhausting it is

04:21.028 --> 04:22.094
to be right all the time.

04:22.096 --> 04:25.330
You know that?
What are you still doing here?

04:25.332 --> 04:27.666
I don't get it.
Go to your room.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.201
-Go. Yes.
-Yes, sir.

04:29.203 --> 04:32.437
Which girl is this,
the first one
or the second one?

04:35.042 --> 04:36.441
SAM: Neither.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.310
This one's brand new.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.524

05:39.707 --> 05:42.841
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-(LAUGHTER)

05:44.912 --> 05:46.411
Hey, you Charlie?

05:46.547 --> 05:50.515
Little Emma told me
to come introduce myself.
I'm Dennis.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.317
(CHUCKLES)

05:52.319 --> 05:54.519
What, are you gonna hurt me
or something?

05:54.521 --> 05:55.620
I look like I'm going to?

05:55.622 --> 05:57.789
I know you've done
some hard time.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.291
The girls told me, man,

05:59.293 --> 06:03.729
because I was saying about
all the posers that I've met.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.064
You know,
lying to impress you
how hard they are.

06:06.066 --> 06:09.134
But you don't have to
impress anybody, do you?

06:12.139 --> 06:16.575
I am everyone
and everyone is me.

06:20.080 --> 06:20.879
(LAUGHING)

06:20.881 --> 06:24.015
Now you're saying something,
man, and I'm hearing you.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.684
I was about to go
have some cookies and milk.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.052
You want to get in on that?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.420
Like, chocolate chip
and stuff?

06:28.422 --> 06:30.589
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, like chocolate chip.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.890
Oatmeal. Coconut.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.827
Oh, and raw milk, man.
You see, raw milk's
a golden food, right?

06:35.829 --> 06:39.798
So all that good bacteria
and the enzymes, it stays in.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.268
It'll keep you well.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.537
It'll give you teeth
like a lion's.

06:46.073 --> 06:46.805
Right.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.840
What about the cookies?
What'll they do for me?

06:48.842 --> 06:52.411
Those'll keep you
fat and happy, brother.
Come on.

06:54.481 --> 06:58.817
Oh, you can leave that here.
I mean, if you want to.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.052
Just make yourself
at home, man.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.224
Any kind of envelope,
anything at all,

07:06.226 --> 07:10.695
shows up at any precinct
with my name on it,
they need to call me.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.398
If they see who delivers it
and let that person get away,

07:13.400 --> 07:16.668
they need to kick
their own ass and call me.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.704
You don't have to
put that last part in.

07:20.507 --> 07:21.540
Unless there's room.

07:21.542 --> 07:25.143
Did you want this
as a directed message
or a broadcast bulletin?

07:25.145 --> 07:25.710
Broadcast bulletin.

07:25.712 --> 07:29.080
Local, just department
citywide, or local
and county sheriffs, too?

07:29.082 --> 07:30.449
Surprise me.

07:31.118 --> 07:35.053
Missing Persons says
your new picture girl's
been gone nine days.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.221
A Donna Healy.

07:36.223 --> 07:36.788
She's got a kid, too.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.958
Was supposed to pick him up
from her husband,
but she never showed.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.927
SAM: Pick him up
from her husband?

07:41.929 --> 07:44.529
Yeah, they're separated,
or he says "estranged."

07:44.531 --> 07:46.031
What's the damn difference?

07:46.033 --> 07:47.833
Separated, you live apart.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.167
Estranged,
you hate each other,

07:49.169 --> 07:53.038
and the lawyers are more
expensive on account of
the $10 words. I'm estranged.

07:53.040 --> 07:58.243
Right. Is there
anything else you need me
to do for you right now?

07:59.346 --> 08:01.847
Yeah, investigate why
you never use napkins.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.382
I'll get a team on that
right away.

08:05.219 --> 08:08.420
And Tina knew her from where?
School, right?

08:08.422 --> 08:11.523
Tennis. Right.
I got it. I got it.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.391
Thank you, ma'am.
You keep thinking, too,

08:13.393 --> 08:17.462
and maybe you'll remember
Tina mentioning Donna Healy.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.332
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.001
-Who's that?
-Tina Greenwood's mother.

08:23.003 --> 08:27.038
Been trying to see if Tina
and the second picture girl
are connected at all.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.741
I got a lot of phone calls
to make.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.676
-Well, you need a hand?
-No. I'm fine.

08:31.678 --> 08:36.915
I love making calls.
I can't get enough of it,
really.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.685
-Okay. Well...
-Uh, uh, uh... Sit down.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.621
Did Tina ever mention to you
the name Donna Healy?

08:42.623 --> 08:45.590
Would you know if Donna Healy
came to church there at all?

08:45.592 --> 08:47.692
She didn't go
to Vineland High,
she went to East Poly.

08:47.694 --> 08:52.597
No, I'm wondering
if you remember a woman
named Donna Healy on, uh...

08:53.066 --> 08:55.700
On any of the other
tennis teams?

08:55.702 --> 08:58.069
Well, if you do happen to
remember meeting Donna,

08:58.071 --> 09:00.805
could you call
Hollywood Division?

09:00.807 --> 09:03.375
Yes. Ask for Hodiak.

09:03.377 --> 09:08.647
H-O-D-I-A-K. Yes, Hodiak.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.415
What?

09:10.417 --> 09:12.117
(CHUCKLES) Is it Jewish?

09:12.119 --> 09:14.819
Uh, it's Ukrainian, ma'am.

09:14.821 --> 09:19.190
This is all very sad. It is.
But thank you for your time.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.760
We do appreciate it.
Thank you.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.032
Could Tina have babysat
for Donna's kid, maybe?

09:27.034 --> 09:32.571
Uh, it's a good thought,
but apparently the in-laws
did all the babysitting.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.605
Mmm, lucky Donna.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.308
I mean,
speaking as young with a kid,
17 is young to have a kid.

09:36.310 --> 09:41.546
Yeah. What are you gonna do?
You meet in high school.
You fall in love.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.583
Although they didn't go
to the same high school.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.818
Donna went to East Poly High,

09:46.820 --> 09:49.421
and the husband went to...

09:49.957 --> 09:53.658
-Not East Poly High.
-He went to Vineland.

09:53.827 --> 09:57.028
-Tina Greenwood
went to Vineland.
-Hold on.

09:57.230 --> 09:57.662
The first girl

09:57.664 --> 10:02.300
went to the same high school
as the second girl's
estranged husband.

10:03.537 --> 10:06.304
You just won a chance
to make fresh coffee.

10:06.306 --> 10:10.208
-Oh, what's that face?
-You're a lucky man.

10:10.210 --> 10:10.909
You get to open the books

10:10.911 --> 10:15.080
and promote another
Medal of Valor winner
into the ranks of detective.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.781
We got open slots, right?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.783
Yeah, but who are you
talking about?

10:19.753 --> 10:22.988
(SCOFFS) Shaggy Nellie?
It's hilarious.

10:22.990 --> 10:23.555
Well, I got one for you.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.824
Blind man walks into a bar
with his seeing-eye dog.

10:25.826 --> 10:26.925
Grabs the dog
by the hind legs,

10:26.927 --> 10:27.959
starts swinging it
around in a circle.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.662
-Bartender says...
-BOTH: Don't mind me.
I'm just looking around.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.330
I told you that joke.

10:32.532 --> 10:32.831
Killjoy.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.066
-Where's this coming
from anyway?
-It's coming from the kid.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.203
He works like a dog
and he's got great instincts.

10:38.639 --> 10:42.340
Jeannie wants to know when
you're coming over for dinner.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.908
Gee, not anytime soon.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.312
Which is exactly when that
hippie flit makes detective.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.015
Oh, excuse me. I got to...

10:50.984 --> 10:53.451
It's your mom. I did warn you.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.587
Just ice it. It'll be fine.

10:55.589 --> 10:58.056
SAM: Tell my mom hello,
you moron.

-What's going on?
-Got about 50 calls.

People saying they heard
a girl screaming,
"Help me. He's killing me."

11:53.980 --> 11:56.848
But, uh, we checked
the three buildings,
down that way.

11:56.850 --> 11:57.282
Can't find her?

11:57.284 --> 11:58.683
We narrowed it down
to this end of the street.

11:58.685 --> 12:04.355
These two buildings
here on the corner,
521 and 526, but that's it.

12:04.658 --> 12:08.593
Just a girl screaming
she's dying,
but nobody can say from where.

<i> pretty hard earlier,</i>
<i> blowing her voice around.</i>

are clear, Detective.

-Okay. How many
guys you got? Six?
-Total, yeah.

to keep things on lockdown.

12:32.819 --> 12:36.421
Good thinking. Well,
send two across the street.
Start canvassing there.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.022
Call for more, and then
you and him come back

12:38.024 --> 12:41.926
and help me finish searching
these two floors. All right?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.020
There.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.523
Got you. We got you.

13:11.525 --> 13:15.794
(CRYING) Should've just
let him do it...

13:15.896 --> 13:18.396
Okay. Did you see him?

13:19.232 --> 13:20.632
Can you tell me?

13:20.634 --> 13:24.035
Honey, can you tell me
what he looked like?

13:24.237 --> 13:28.006
That's okay.
You'll remember later.
All right?

13:29.576 --> 13:31.276
Tell me later.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.077

13:39.019 --> 13:40.552

13:44.891 --> 13:45.790
OFFICER:
4C's a bedridden old guy

13:45.792 --> 13:46.858
who called Wilshire Division
and got through.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.460
4D's a couple with a new baby
who slept through
the whole thing.

13:49.462 --> 13:54.465
4E didn't hear anything,
and I believe her because
4E is a varsity alcoholic.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.901
Why don't you go back to 2F?

13:56.903 --> 13:59.537
See if that guy got back yet.
2F.

14:00.373 --> 14:04.209
Hi, ma'am. I'm investigating
what happened to that
poor woman... Hey.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.578
-Hey.
-I recognize you.

14:06.580 --> 14:10.849
You used to run that brothel
on Norton...

14:10.984 --> 14:11.749
Harriet or...

14:11.751 --> 14:13.284
-Hazel.
-(CHUCKLES) Hazel.

14:13.286 --> 14:17.388
-You didn't save your money,
I see.
-Listen. I heard her.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.224
-I heard her.
-Mmm-hmm.

14:19.226 --> 14:22.160
-She was screaming.
She said he was stabbing her.
-Uh-huh.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.729
I called the police,
but I couldn't get through.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.364
High volume of calls,
apparently.

14:26.366 --> 14:30.168
He never came out,
and I watched,
even after the cops got here.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.769
I wanted to get a description
of him for you.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.571
That's okay. Well, might he
have gone out the back door?

14:33.573 --> 14:36.808
The back exit's
in the boiler room,
and it's chained closed.

14:36.810 --> 14:39.310
Too many burglaries.
Nobody can get out of there.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.712
If there's a fire in here,
we're all dead,

14:40.714 --> 14:43.481
and I'd rather be dead
than have to buy
another television.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.783
Okay, so,
you didn't see him go
out the front door,

14:45.785 --> 14:47.352
and he didn't go out
the back exit,

14:47.354 --> 14:49.220
and then we showed up
and posted unis in the lobby.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.357
-Unless he walked
right by you.
-Which he didn't.

14:52.626 --> 14:54.926
He could still be
in the building.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.762
Thank you, Hazel.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.800

I got your keys.

15:12.445 --> 15:16.447
Not in apartment 2F, anyway.
Thank you for these.

15:17.317 --> 15:23.288
-So, 2F. That's Mr. Lamb?
Ian Lamb, right?
-Yeah.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.122
When was the last time
you saw him?

15:24.124 --> 15:28.760
Uh, a few days ago, maybe.
He's not around much.
He works a lot.

15:28.762 --> 15:33.064
Okay. Well, we're not gonna
get out of your hair
just yet, Mr. Plaza.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.033
We've got to canvass
the whole building again,

15:35.035 --> 15:38.970

for strange visitors,
overnight guests,

15:38.972 --> 15:41.239
apparitions in the hallways.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.876
Yeah, I never thought
that screaming was
coming from our roof.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.745
Marisa was such a sweet girl.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.448
To think about that
happening to her...

15:50.750 --> 15:52.417
(STUTTERS)

15:52.419 --> 15:53.418
I got four kids, you know?
Daughters.

15:53.420 --> 15:58.423
And it just makes me
never want to take my eyes
off of them again, you know?

15:59.392 --> 16:01.459
You got daughters?

16:01.461 --> 16:02.961
A son, actually.

16:03.029 --> 16:05.663
Well, but still, with what
you see in your work,

16:05.665 --> 16:09.033
you must be afraid
for him sometimes.

16:10.904 --> 16:13.438
I'm afraid for him
all the time.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.240
Can you unchain
that fire door, please?

16:16.242 --> 16:17.942
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

16:39.299 --> 16:43.701
Is this your house?
My goodness! It's delightful.

16:43.703 --> 16:47.171

What are you doing here, Sam?

16:47.407 --> 16:48.906

16:48.908 --> 16:51.642
Yeah. It's called tit for tat.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.411
-You're the tit.
-That's funny.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.379
-It really is.
-I think so.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.546
-That's really funny.
-(BOTH CHUCKLING)

16:55.548 --> 16:58.449
Good. Because I worry that
my sense of humor suffers

all the actual real
police work that I do.

Do you just sit around,
thinking about ways

17:06.459 --> 17:07.692
to make things worse
for yourself?

17:07.694 --> 17:12.964
-To get yourself into
an even deeper pile?
-Hell no. Just comes to me.

talking about him.

-RON: Yeah.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.310
LILLIAN: My Lord...

17:26.312 --> 17:29.747
I have not seen you
since I was still at Pan Am.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.716
And you have not
changed a bit.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.152
Oh, stop it. Listen to him.

those uniforms.

upside down.

what kind of numbers
we're working with.

Why not a Panther Party

The church
is a non-profit organization,

19:38.244 --> 19:42.113

if people wanna donate things.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.115

raise consciousness
in the community.

It needs raising, and kids are
a great place to start.

not in their family
working for them,

go red.

25:17.416 --> 25:19.216
I don't think I've ever met
a sculptor before.

25:19.218 --> 25:22.119
I think you should go on
<i> What's My Line?</i> You'd win.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.855
Stonecutter by trade.
Not quite as romantic.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.324
I wish I could
make a living sculpting,

25:27.326 --> 25:29.026
but I suspect
I'm not good enough.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.362
Well, a little doubt
is good for the soul.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.230
Maybe. Anyways, I keep at it.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.399
Mr. Plaza lets me use
the boiler room to work,

25:35.401 --> 25:38.335
keeps my materials locked up
down there for me.

25:38.337 --> 25:39.870
A patron of the arts.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.171
Or just a very kind man.

25:41.173 --> 25:41.739
Hard worker, too.

25:41.741 --> 25:46.544
He's gotta be, I suspect,
raising five kids
on a super's salary.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.178
Five kids. He told me four.

25:48.180 --> 25:52.316
Well, he's had a hard time
with his oldest.
Manny, Emmanuel.

25:52.318 --> 25:57.388
Had a lot of trouble
around here last year with
burglaries, vandalism, and...

25:57.390 --> 25:59.557
Anyway, Mr. P.
threw Manny out.

25:59.559 --> 26:02.526
Probably still knows
his way back in, though, huh?

26:05.765 --> 26:06.897
Hey.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.432
I, uh...
I took down the chains.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.234
-Oh?
-Don't arrest me.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.370
Not my job. I'm homicide.

26:15.274 --> 26:18.275
I talked to, uh, 2F finally.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.110
(CHUCKLING)
Mr. Lamb came home.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.413
We had a conversation.
Turns out he's a stonecutter.

26:22.415 --> 26:25.115
He's worked
on the Masonic temple,
the cathedral downtown.

26:25.117 --> 26:27.618
Of course, you know all that.

26:27.887 --> 26:31.755
He said that
you let him keep his
sculpting materials down here.

26:31.757 --> 26:34.558
Where do you
store them for him?

26:36.729 --> 26:37.861
There.

26:37.863 --> 26:40.564
Who holds the key
to that padlock?

26:41.033 --> 26:42.132
I do.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.134
That's what he said.

26:44.136 --> 26:45.769
He also said
you have five children.

26:45.771 --> 26:49.873
Four daughters and one son.
A 20-year-old son.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.342
He told me that.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.177
You didn't.

26:54.380 --> 27:00.017
But that's okay, Mr. Plaza,
because you're gonna
tell me now.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.986
(CHAIN JANGLING)

27:07.727 --> 27:10.260
Now, maybe you were
defending yourself.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.663
Seems to me girls are
feeling their oats these days,

27:12.665 --> 27:15.699
getting pretty disrespectful,
if you ask me.

27:18.504 --> 27:21.839
You hungry? You want a burger
or something?

27:22.642 --> 27:25.542
Some fries, a shake? Nothing?

27:27.279 --> 27:29.313
Manny. Manny Plaza.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.616
Emmanuel Plaza.
That's a nice name.

27:32.618 --> 27:35.252
Why do they call you Peanut?

27:35.254 --> 27:38.155
Is it for the reasons I think?

27:39.425 --> 27:41.125
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

27:44.530 --> 27:48.666
Hey, your missing girl,
Donna Healy?
The estranged husband's here.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.167
I thought he was
on a business trip.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.636
No, he's in the break room.

27:52.838 --> 27:53.303
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:53.305 --> 27:56.106
So, I briefed
Lieutenant Gilbert
on what Lucille gave us.

27:56.108 --> 27:56.540
SAM: Yeah.

27:56.542 --> 28:00.044
He's saying he wants me
to get her in a room
with the DA next.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.545
That's great.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.881
You drinking again?

28:04.750 --> 28:06.917
You are gonna make
a good detective.

28:06.919 --> 28:09.219
I don't care
what anybody says.

28:09.221 --> 28:09.653
Hey, listen.

28:09.655 --> 28:13.057
Can you take a run
at the suspect today?
I'm striking out.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.858
Okay. Suggestions?

28:14.860 --> 28:18.529
Well, his nickname is Peanut,
so maybe you guys can bond

28:18.531 --> 28:21.065
over your tiny apple bags.
(LAUGHING)

28:22.535 --> 28:27.204
Or hatred of your father
could be a fruitful area.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.108
Peanut.

28:31.110 --> 28:34.244
So, you're a traveling
salesman, Mr. Healy?

28:34.246 --> 28:35.412
What is it that you sell?

28:35.414 --> 28:38.982
Acne creams and ointments
for Beechwood Pharmaceutical.

28:38.984 --> 28:42.352
Hmm. And you and Donna
are estranged.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.588
What estranged you two?

28:45.057 --> 28:46.690
She had started
doing modeling.

28:46.692 --> 28:49.526
Now, strictly speaking,
I didn't mind most of it.

28:49.528 --> 28:53.831
But when she got into
the pin-up stuff,
that was too much,

28:53.833 --> 28:55.132
and we argued about that
a lot.

28:55.134 --> 28:59.470
Well, what's the difference
between that and stripping,
really, right?

28:59.472 --> 29:01.038
And I asked her to stop.
She wouldn't.

29:01.040 --> 29:05.542
Then, six months ago,
I told her if she didn't stop
taking the pin-up jobs,

29:05.544 --> 29:08.679
she could move out,
and there she went.

29:08.848 --> 29:09.847
She took your son.

29:09.849 --> 29:13.684
I showed up while
she was working one day
and took him to my parents.

29:13.686 --> 29:15.052
He's better off with them.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.420
And one time
after he'd been with her,

29:16.422 --> 29:18.822
there was a cigarette butt
in his diaper.

29:18.824 --> 29:22.159
If you had to hazard a guess
as to where she was right now,

29:22.161 --> 29:24.561
where would you say
your wife is?

29:24.563 --> 29:26.063
(SCOFFS)

29:26.165 --> 29:26.730
Went off with a man.

29:26.732 --> 29:30.400
She would do that,
and go this long
without contacting you?

29:30.402 --> 29:31.368
You know,
I wouldn't have thought so,

29:31.370 --> 29:37.407
but if you would've asked
would she rather quit
pin-up modeling or leave me,

29:37.409 --> 29:39.176
I would've said
she would've quit,

29:39.178 --> 29:41.979
so maybe I don't know her
that well.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.850
Who's Tina Greenwood?

29:47.686 --> 29:48.986
I don't know. Who is she?

29:48.988 --> 29:51.555
You went to high school
with her.

29:51.557 --> 29:55.058
Sorry. Vineland High
is a big place.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.927
Anyway, why do you ask?

29:57.663 --> 29:59.029
(DOOR OPENS)

30:14.213 --> 30:15.445
Yeah.

30:17.216 --> 30:18.649

30:18.651 --> 30:20.517
Mmm.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.805
So, what's going on?

30:42.441 --> 30:44.241
Oh, Hodi's got
another case going,

30:44.243 --> 30:46.743
so he told me to come
sit in here while he's busy.

30:46.745 --> 30:51.615
Said you were stonewalling
him anyway, so no rush, right?

30:53.786 --> 30:55.385
What else he say?

30:55.921 --> 30:58.188
-Hodiak?
-Mmm-hmm.

30:58.257 --> 31:03.227
He said your dad dropped
the dime on you. That true?

31:04.830 --> 31:06.096
Yeah.

31:06.098 --> 31:08.899
(SCOFFS) Unbelievable.

31:10.769 --> 31:11.969
What is?

31:11.971 --> 31:15.172
Just, someone doesn't want
to have kids, then don't.

31:15.174 --> 31:19.042
But if you do,
be a man about it, you know?

31:20.145 --> 31:21.378
Yeah.

31:22.248 --> 31:24.681
And I'll tell you something,

31:24.817 --> 31:26.717
if it made my dad's life
any easier,

31:26.719 --> 31:30.420
(SCOFFS) he would've
turned me in at the drop
of a hat for anything.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.890
For the Lindbergh baby.

31:36.996 --> 31:40.063
What's he saying you did,
anyway?

31:41.867 --> 31:44.468
Stab some girl
in his building.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.503
-Damn.
-Uh-huh.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.940
And, I mean, he got proof?
I mean, were you even there?

31:49.942 --> 31:53.410
I don't live there anymore.
You know, he kicked me out.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.712
He didn't care.
I didn't have nothing.

31:55.714 --> 31:59.082
Hey, man, I had to enlist
when my dad kicked me out.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.084
That's how bad off I was.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.286
I almost did that.

32:02.288 --> 32:03.754
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:03.756 --> 32:05.422
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

32:06.025 --> 32:08.225
He doesn't know
where his wife is.

32:08.227 --> 32:11.862
He doesn't remember
the first missing girl
from high school.

32:11.864 --> 32:13.030
I don't have any bodies.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.498
All I got are these
damn pictures,

32:14.500 --> 32:16.133
and I can't shoot my wad
on a hunch.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.868
Yeah, well, Shafe's
practically got your animal

32:17.870 --> 32:19.670
writing a how-to
on killing that girl.

32:19.672 --> 32:21.138
So then I came up
in the elevator,

32:21.140 --> 32:24.007
and there she was
in the lobby. Uh!

32:24.009 --> 32:26.576
-Now, this is the girl?
-Mmm-hmm.

32:26.578 --> 32:29.346
Mmm. She was beautiful, man.

32:29.348 --> 32:32.616
Beautiful.
Legs to next week, just...

32:32.618 --> 32:34.718
Mmm!
You know what I'm saying.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.419
Anyway, so we start talking,

32:35.421 --> 32:37.921
and I tell her
I'm the super's son,
and she says she's Marisa.

32:37.923 --> 32:40.090
We go up on the elevator
to the fifth floor.

32:40.092 --> 32:42.626
She unlocks her door,
but she says,
"My roommate's home,"

32:42.628 --> 32:44.661
so I say,
"What about the roof?"

32:44.663 --> 32:46.463
Uh-huh! Thinking on your feet.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.431
-Okay.
-I like it.

32:47.433 --> 32:51.735
Okay, so we go up,
and she's kissing me,
you know,

32:51.737 --> 32:56.707
and she's got my hands on her,
all over her, you know?

32:57.609 --> 32:57.975
Right.

32:57.977 --> 33:02.112
Then she says,
"Stop now, or I'll scream."

33:02.247 --> 33:04.581
After she was kissing you?

33:05.117 --> 33:06.149
Yeah.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.352
Just two kids trying to have
a good time.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.754
Talking so loud,
I had to show her my blade.

33:10.756 --> 33:16.927
It was like being in a fight,
not knowing how many punches
you threw.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.095
You know?

33:18.097 --> 33:20.464
So I went down
to my dad's place,

33:20.466 --> 33:22.966
and he says
he's gonna help me.

33:23.469 --> 33:28.905
So he gives me a shower,
hides me in the boiler room.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.141
(BREATHES SHARPLY)

33:31.143 --> 33:35.579
And then he says he's gonna
figure out what's what.

33:38.884 --> 33:41.651
When I come out,
he turns me in.

33:41.653 --> 33:45.756
I don't know why I was
expecting anything different.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.592
You know what you should do?

33:48.594 --> 33:49.226
What's that?

33:49.228 --> 33:52.529
You should get your story
on record. All of it.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.399
Right now, before he has
a chance to change his.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.501
You know, get you in deeper.

33:57.970 --> 33:59.202
Right?

34:02.508 --> 34:04.241
What do you think?

34:07.579 --> 34:10.113
I think that girl was a slut.

34:12.217 --> 34:16.319
You ready to bring him up
into detective squad now,
or what?

34:16.321 --> 34:17.120
Well, that depends.

34:17.122 --> 34:20.457
You ready to step up
and do what needs to be done?

34:24.129 --> 34:25.862
Are you seriously making
this kid's promotion

34:25.864 --> 34:30.033

I come to dinner
at your damn house?

man's justice?

-What can I bring?

you don't make a difference,

that there are other things

that you could be doing
that would be more fulfilling,

you're embarrassed

in front of your new
Panther friends.

Probably giving you
a hard time about
being married to a pig.

That's what I think.

making a difference,
solving murders.

You're shrilling
on everything.

36:53.779 --> 36:56.346
I'm trying to help you,
big shot.

36:56.348 --> 36:56.646
Wait...

36:56.648 --> 36:59.749
What, you think 'cause
you got a couple of hits
that you got it made?

36:59.751 --> 37:02.719
I can talk to you
any way I want to talk to you.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.087
I'm your father.

37:04.423 --> 37:05.922
(SCOFFS)

37:06.992 --> 37:11.194
You frustrated,
booze-bag piece of crap.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.930
(SNICKERS)

37:15.267 --> 37:17.534
Can't even play an instrument,

37:17.536 --> 37:22.472
but still,
it's always in there.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.674
He's always in there.

37:25.043 --> 37:27.143
You just got to
rise above it, man.

37:27.145 --> 37:28.678
Just rise.

37:28.947 --> 37:34.351
Now, look, I don't always
listen to myself
when I say that.

37:35.687 --> 37:38.088
But I hope that you do,

37:38.357 --> 37:42.626
because I can tell, man,
you got some
good music in you.

37:43.295 --> 37:47.030
Some deep, beautiful music.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I can't wait to hear it.

37:53.538 --> 37:55.205
What about now?

37:57.909 --> 37:59.943
You want to hear it now?

38:00.012 --> 38:01.711
Now is good.

38:06.385 --> 38:06.683
Hi.

38:06.685 --> 38:10.186
-Grace,
you remember Ed Cutler?
-Nice to see you again.

38:10.188 --> 38:11.554
Come on in.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.326
Uh, my wife, Jeannie.

38:16.461 --> 38:17.594
Grace Karn.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.362
So glad you could come.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.664
Dinner smells wonderful.

38:20.666 --> 38:23.133
Thank you. We already ate.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.802
(STAMMERING) You said 8:00.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.237
That is what I said.

38:27.239 --> 38:28.438
It was ready at 7:00.

38:28.440 --> 38:33.109
If you want some,
there's dishes in there.
You can have the rest.

38:38.317 --> 38:40.850
I made a pitcher of gin sours.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.721
I love gin sours.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.459
What the hell are you on, Cut?

38:49.461 --> 38:50.994
She thought you were
bringing Opal.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.163
Why would she think
I was bringing Opal?

38:53.165 --> 38:54.130
I might have told her
you two reconciled.

38:54.132 --> 38:57.767
Uh-huh,
and when did you tell her
that you were mistaken?

38:57.769 --> 38:59.336
Uh... About noon.

38:59.338 --> 39:02.105
And that's why
we're not eating?
Not that I'm complaining.

39:02.107 --> 39:03.106
I told her you and Opal
split for good,

39:03.108 --> 39:04.708
and suddenly she's got
bamboo under my nails.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.309
Why have I worked so many
night shifts this year?

39:06.311 --> 39:09.779
Why'd I switch aftershaves?
Where was I three months ago
on Thursday?

39:09.781 --> 39:12.549
Can we please just drink?
Please.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.722
Hey, Jeannie,
we don't even need dinner,

39:18.724 --> 39:22.092
as long as you made
that pineapple pimento dip.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.461
I made lobster relish.

39:24.463 --> 39:27.063
Even better. Even better.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.165
Mucus on a cracker.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.704
Come on in, baby.
Don't let the moths inside.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.873
Sam, I don't want to
go in there.

39:36.875 --> 39:40.777
Oh, you're mad.
I know you're mad, okay?

39:40.779 --> 39:42.879
Next time Cut and Jeannie
invite us over,

39:42.881 --> 39:44.547
we'll just kill ourselves
instead.

39:44.549 --> 39:45.815
Okay? How's that?

39:45.817 --> 39:47.851
At least we went somewhere.

39:47.853 --> 39:48.952
Even if it was awful,
I'd rather do that

39:48.954 --> 39:53.923
than sit in there and
wait for you to not come home
when you said that you would.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.058
Are we drunk?

39:55.060 --> 39:55.925
How drunk are we?

39:55.927 --> 39:57.827
-What's happening?
-I don't know!

39:57.829 --> 40:00.430
I thought that we were
together now,

40:00.432 --> 40:01.965
that we were doing this
together, but instead,

40:01.967 --> 40:04.834
I'm just alone again
in a different man's house.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.170
Baby, you know my job.
You know things come up.

40:07.172 --> 40:10.106
You know I have to
work cases based on
timing, availability...

40:10.108 --> 40:11.074
Right. Reduce it to that.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.876
Make me sound
petty and resentful

40:12.878 --> 40:14.811
of you being
an instrument of justice.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.079
-Okay.
-Thank you.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.447
You're right.

40:18.216 --> 40:19.582
You're right.

40:19.684 --> 40:21.184
What are you?

40:24.689 --> 40:26.289
You tell me.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.793
You're the woman I love.

40:31.630 --> 40:34.931
Sam, I don't feel loved.

40:38.370 --> 40:39.669
Mmm.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.771
'Cause you wanna leave,

40:43.742 --> 40:47.410
and you're telling a story
that lets you.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.412
(SCOFFS)

40:51.349 --> 40:52.582
Yeah.

40:53.018 --> 40:56.386
And you hurt me into it,
again.

40:56.388 --> 41:00.790

41:57.682 --> 41:59.916

(GRUNTING)

42:07.559 --> 42:09.425

42:13.732 --> 42:18.935
I'm the devil, and I'm here
to do the devil's business.
