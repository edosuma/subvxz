- Nope.

- No, it's just...

- because I wanted to listen to music?
- you're being ridiculous,

02:02.372 --> 02:04.580
- because you have a great life.
- I'm sorry I'm not perfect.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.329
No one's asking you to be perfect.
Just considerate would do.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.661
I don't even want to go to school
in this state anyway.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.793

I want to go to the East Coast.

Your dad and I will barely
be able to afford in-state tuition.

- There are loans, scholarships.
- Your very smart brother...

02:18.013 --> 02:20.847
- he can't even find a job.
- He and Shelly work. They have jobs.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.219

No, of course you don't,

about anybody but yourself.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.488
And Immaculate Heart is already a luxury.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.315

in front of him at Sac High.

So, you're telling me

knifed right in front of you?

02:47.793 --> 02:50.752
He barely saw that.
I wanna go where culture is,

02:50.837 --> 02:53.204

- How in the world did I raise such a snob?

02:53.298 --> 02:55.290

02:55.384 --> 02:56.841
You couldn't get
into those schools, anyway.

- Mom!
- You can't even pass your driver's test.

let me practice enough!

03:03.058 --> 03:05.015
you're not even worth
state tuition, Christine.

- My name is Lady Bird.
- Well, actually, it's not,

03:07.938 --> 03:09.179
- and it's ridiculous...
- Call me Lady Bird,

03:09.272 --> 03:10.888
- because your name is Christine.
- like you said you would.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.099
You should just go to city college.
You know, with your work ethic,

03:13.193 --> 03:16.402

and then back to city college,

03:16.488 --> 03:20.402
and then maybe you'd learn to pull
yourself up and not expect everybody to...

03:20.492 --> 03:22.279

05:40.841 --> 05:44.334
Perhaps you haven't always been

05:45.762 --> 05:50.723
They do a fall musical and a spring play,

What I'd really like
is to be on Math Olympiad.

I'd have friends over all the time

the snacks upstairs to the TV room."

07:01.296 --> 07:04.130
Yeah. Just once, I'd like to have the song
"New York Groove" playing

really applies to my life.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.133

07:12.390 --> 07:15.758
- Your parents would pay for that?
- Scholarships, financial aid...

07:15.852 --> 07:19.971
I'll figure it out. My mom thinks I can't
get in, but she is sorely mistaken.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.560

- Don't be a Republican.

That would be so nice.

He promised me his old car when I turn 18.

Ugh! That car should be illegal.

Jenna Walton's not doing any off-roading.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.082

11:12.630 --> 11:13.962

Yeah.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.139

Embarrassing, I use that.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.820
I don't know if mine
is the right kind though.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.074
Maybe it's different
when you actually have a penis in there.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.080

11:52.170 --> 11:54.878

21:35.503 --> 21:37.620
Of course, he probably wouldn't anyway.
He's Mr. Nice Guy,

21:37.713 --> 21:39.625
- and I always have to be the bad guy.
- Can we please just talk...

21:39.715 --> 21:40.956
- It can't look like a rag,
- ...about this tomorrow?

21:41.050 --> 21:42.632
because that makes us look like rags.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.710
You wanna know the truth?
Here's the truth.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.887
Some of your friends' fathers
could employ your father,

21:46.972 --> 21:50.136
and they're not gonna do it
if it looks like his family is trash.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.182
You understand?

21:59.109 --> 22:03.069
Didn't you ever go to sleep without
putting all your clothes away perfectly?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.145
Like even once?

22:04.865 --> 22:06.822
And don't you wish your mom
hadn't gotten angry?

22:09.495 --> 22:11.202
My mother was an abusive alcoholic.

22:16.043 --> 22:19.912
So, I understand you're not interested
in any Catholic colleges.

22:20.005 --> 22:20.995
No way.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.625
Sorry. But yes, no way.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.631
Then you'll be applying to UCs
and state schools.

22:27.721 --> 22:31.260
Yeah, but also those East Coast
liberal arts schools like Yale,

22:31.350 --> 22:33.933
but not Yale,
because I probably couldn't get in.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.760
[laughing]

22:37.982 --> 22:39.518
You definitely couldn't get in.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.434
Part of my job
is to help you be realistic.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.485
Yeah. It seems like everyone's job.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.531
Your SAT scores are strangely very good.

22:47.616 --> 22:52.111
I had placed some calls to local alumni
of the schools you're interested in,

22:52.204 --> 22:54.617
but unfortunately,
all the interviews are taken.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.539
[sighs] So what does that mean?

22:56.625 --> 23:00.494
It means you'll have to get in
on how you look on paper.

23:02.006 --> 23:06.967
<i>Dreams don't die,
so keep an eye on your dream</i>

23:07.052 --> 23:09.965
<i>And before you know where you are,
there you are</i>

23:10.055 --> 23:11.341
All right. Stop, stop, stop.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.688
<i>[Danny] Should we go home?</i>

23:23.777 --> 23:26.485
<i>[Lady Bird] My mom is always mad.</i>

23:26.572 --> 23:29.656
Doesn't matter if I get home late.
She'll be mad at me anyway.

23:29.742 --> 23:33.611
- Your mom's hard on you.
- Yeah, well, she loves me a lot.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.035
Pick a star for us.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.248
That one. Right there.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.251
Next to the bright one,
and then the dim one. You see it?

23:46.008 --> 23:46.919
Yeah.

23:48.594 --> 23:49.835
That's our star.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.379
You know...

23:55.142 --> 23:58.135
you can touch my boobs, right?

23:58.228 --> 24:02.518
I know. It's just that
I respect you too much for that.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.394
[chuckles] Cool. Awesome.

24:06.487 --> 24:09.104
I totally get that. Thank you.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.609
You're welcome.

24:10.699 --> 24:13.612
If you had boobs,
I wouldn't touch them either.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.739
I respect you so much...

24:16.997 --> 24:19.785
because I love you.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.206
I love you too.

24:27.758 --> 24:31.547
- Let's name our star Claude.
- That's pretentious, don't you think?

24:31.637 --> 24:34.300
It's French. What should we name it?

24:36.141 --> 24:38.554
Bruce. [chuckles]

24:40.145 --> 24:42.683
- I love you!
- I love you.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.516
[sighs]

24:45.609 --> 24:47.441
Bruce.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.438
It's normal to not touch a penis.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.439
I have to go to class.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.193
- But I have free period.
- I need to pass history.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.494
I think we're done with
the learning portion of high school.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.037
- I'm gonna go.
- No.

25:00.124 --> 25:01.660
- Mm-hmm.
- I hate being alone.

25:01.750 --> 25:02.911
Bye! Love you!

25:38.037 --> 25:41.826
Did Danny say whether his grandmother
has a formal Thanksgiving?

25:41.915 --> 25:45.249
I don't know. There are a lot of kids,
but she lives in the Fab 40s.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.169
Oh, well, your dad and I went to a dinner
party once in that neighborhood.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.963
The CEO of ISC. That was pretty formal.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.175
You're not going to a funeral.

25:54.261 --> 25:57.254
Well, I don't know.
What says "rich people Thanksgiving"?

25:57.347 --> 26:00.340
I just think it's such a shame that
you're spending your last Thanksgiving

26:00.434 --> 26:02.391
with a family you've never met
instead of us, but...

26:02.478 --> 26:04.765
I know. I guess you want it that way.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.314
- Are you tired?
- No.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.393
- Hey, Marion.
- Hey, Joyce. Hey, how's the baby?

26:11.487 --> 26:14.321
- She's crawling.
- No! I wanna see a picture at checkout.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.988
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.613
- 'Cause if you're tired, we can sit down.
- I'm not tired.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.069
Oh, okay. I just couldn't tell
because you were dragging your feet.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.162
Well, I just couldn't tell.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.702
Why didn't you just say,
"Pick up your feet"?

26:25.793 --> 26:26.783
I didn't know if you were tired.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.459
- You were being passive-aggressive.
- No, I wasn't.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.411
- You are so infuriating.
- Please stop yelling.

26:30.506 --> 26:34.341
- I'm not yelling. Oh! Perfect!
- Honey, do you love it?

26:55.906 --> 27:00.947
So, because my grade book has...
disappeared, here's what we're gonna do.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.278
I'm gonna count on you
to reconstruct it, okay?

27:03.372 --> 27:05.455
Now, I know you all know
your grades better than anybody.

27:05.541 --> 27:09.376
I have a general idea, but this is
all about the honor code right now.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.002
Hi. A-minus.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.955
Pretty sure it was an A.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.257
I'm not, but okay.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.881
It was. Trust me,
I know talent when I see it.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.296
You're welcome. Thank you.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.268
Hey, I think B.

27:28.522 --> 27:32.061
I thought it was more like B-minus,
maybe even C-plus territory?

27:32.151 --> 27:34.438
No, because I did really well
on the last quiz.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.611
Oh. I seem to remember you
doing only slightly better.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.404
That brought my average up to a B.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.737
Okay. B it is.

27:43.036 --> 27:46.200
- It's your honor.
- [doorbell rings]

27:46.623 --> 27:48.660
Lady Bird, your lover awaits!

27:48.750 --> 27:51.663
- Hello, Danny! The famous Danny!
- Hi.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.460
- Aw!
- Oh-ho-ho!

27:53.547 --> 27:55.834
Aren't you adorable?

27:55.924 --> 27:57.961
- Larry, isn't he adorable?
- He's adorable.

27:58.051 --> 28:01.419
You're driving her and everything. Wow.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.505
Yeah, well, thank you
for letting Lady Bird come

28:03.599 --> 28:05.682
to my grandmother's Thanksgiving,
Mrs. McPherson.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.009
No. No more politeness. Call me Marion.

28:08.103 --> 28:10.060
Oh. Well, nice to meet you, Mr. McPherson.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.514
Please, call me Mr. Larry McPherson.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.725
[laughing] Larry. Sit down, Danny.

28:14.818 --> 28:17.105
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Oh, no, I'm fine.

28:17.196 --> 28:21.110
Hey, I'm Miguel, the brother. I think
Lady Bird wants to make an entrance.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.941
She's mad
we don't have a spiral staircase.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.116
[laughter]

28:24.870 --> 28:26.281
- Shelly.
- What?

28:26.705 --> 28:28.822
- Is my name.
- Oh. Hi.

28:28.916 --> 28:31.078
- Hi.
- [chuckles]

28:31.168 --> 28:34.332
It's funny. On my way over here,
I went over the train tracks.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.458
- Oh, you took H Street.
- Right. And so,

28:36.548 --> 28:39.256
Lady Bird always says that she lives
on the wrong side of the tracks,

28:39.343 --> 28:41.710
but I always thought
that was like a metaphor.

28:41.803 --> 28:44.887
- Oh.
- But there are actual train tracks.

28:44.973 --> 28:45.963
[door closes]

28:46.058 --> 28:48.345
[Danny] Oh, hi. You look amazing!

28:48.435 --> 28:51.769
- What the hell is in the duffel bag?
- Don't worry about it. Jeez.

28:51.855 --> 28:55.815
- My grandmother will love that dress.
- [sighs] Okay.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.485
- Wait.
- [chuckles]

29:06.578 --> 29:08.865
- This is your grandma's house?
- Yeah.

29:08.956 --> 29:12.666
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Danny! You're late.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.744
Oh, uh, well, thank you so much
for having us.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.248
- This is Lady Bird.
- Hi.

29:17.339 --> 29:20.127
Hi, honey. Been anxious to meet you.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.924

- Is this a joke?
- No.

29:29.559 --> 29:32.051
- Pull these out...
- Oh...

29:32.145 --> 29:34.102
Almost done. Do you like it?

29:34.189 --> 29:38.229
Lovely. I love it. Would you mind

- Ding dong. I'm outside.

56:15.998 --> 56:18.456
<i>- What?
- I'm standing outside.</i>

56:20.002 --> 56:22.369
No. Just leave.

56:22.462 --> 56:23.452
Leave.

56:24.464 --> 56:26.672
- Fuck!
- Hello.

56:26.758 --> 56:27.839
Hi.

56:30.178 --> 56:31.544
[inhales]

56:35.309 --> 56:36.641
So this is your house?

56:38.395 --> 56:39.806
Yeah.

56:39.897 --> 56:42.890
That lady in the other house
was totally freaked out.

56:42.983 --> 56:46.067
That's my friend's grandma.
That's her house.

56:48.322 --> 56:50.234
Why did you say it was your house?

56:53.285 --> 56:55.652
I wished I lived in that house.

56:56.747 --> 57:00.331
I don't even sort of understand why
somebody would lie about that.

57:00.417 --> 57:02.033
I- I didn't lie.

57:02.127 --> 57:04.039
You lied. You're a liar.

57:04.129 --> 57:05.961
I hate dishonesty.

57:06.048 --> 57:07.038
I'm sorry.

57:11.803 --> 57:13.544
Apology accepted, I guess.

57:16.224 --> 57:17.931
Are we still friends?

57:18.936 --> 57:22.680
I mean, if you're still Kyle's girlfriend,
then yeah, I guess I'll see you around.

57:24.107 --> 57:25.097
[dogs barking]

57:25.192 --> 57:26.182
[texting]

57:29.154 --> 57:32.272
<i>[reporter] Mortar rounds fired at the camp
that will fly over them</i>

57:32.366 --> 57:35.530
<i>if they are down below
on surface of the ground.</i>

57:35.619 --> 57:38.987
<i>And that is hard work, indeed. Believe me.
We've had to do it...</i>

57:41.917 --> 57:43.078
[Lady Bird] I'm ready.

57:44.586 --> 57:45.793
[Kyle] What?

57:45.879 --> 57:48.622
I'm ready to have sex.

57:48.715 --> 57:50.752
Oh. Okay.

57:51.843 --> 57:52.833
Great.

58:01.353 --> 58:03.470
You're so dexterous with that. [chuckles]

58:03.563 --> 58:04.553
Thanks.

58:08.151 --> 58:09.733
Oh.

58:14.574 --> 58:15.655
[exhales]

58:17.869 --> 58:19.360
- You okay?
- Yeah.

58:21.957 --> 58:23.198
[kisses]

58:25.377 --> 58:26.663
[moans]

58:30.674 --> 58:33.838
[Lady Bird moaning]

58:38.348 --> 58:39.884
[Kyle moans]

58:42.686 --> 58:43.676
Are you...

58:44.479 --> 58:47.062
- Are you done?
- Yeah. Yes.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.392
Sorry. I was confused.

58:51.486 --> 58:53.569
- You have like...
- What?

58:53.655 --> 58:55.988
- You have some sort of like blood.
- What?

58:56.074 --> 58:57.690
Oh. Shit!

58:57.784 --> 58:59.241
I get nosebleeds.

59:00.871 --> 59:02.282
- Here.
- Thanks.

59:02.372 --> 59:03.362
I'm sorry.

59:04.499 --> 59:05.615
No. I'm good.

59:06.626 --> 59:09.460
[Lady Bird] Remember when tie-dye
was an activity?

59:09.546 --> 59:12.960
Oh, I didn't make that shirt.
My parents got it for me at Sea Ranch.

59:13.050 --> 59:15.542
You can read Sea Ranch if you look close.

59:18.764 --> 59:20.721
Cut to ten years later.

59:22.309 --> 59:23.891
What?

59:23.977 --> 59:26.515
Like how ten years ago,
you were in first grade.

59:26.605 --> 59:28.267
Now we cut to...

59:29.733 --> 59:32.441
What does cut to mean to you?

59:32.527 --> 59:35.440
Or like, you know, little did he know.

59:35.530 --> 59:37.066
Nothing you're saying is making any sense.

59:37.157 --> 59:38.944
How we're not virgins now.

59:39.034 --> 59:42.243
We deflowered each other.
We have each other's flowers.

59:49.127 --> 59:50.208
Sorry.

59:52.089 --> 59:53.250
I'm just happy.

59:58.178 --> 01:00:00.295
I didn't lose my virginity to you.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:03.881
Wait...

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:05.883
What?

01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:09.228
I lost my virginity to Cassy Duvall.

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:11.472
Excuse me?

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:13.102
You said you were a virgin.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:15.230
No, I didn't. 'Cause I'm not.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.528
- And I haven't lied in two years.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:22.613
Yeah. I probably slept with,
like, six people.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:27.785
You don't even know if it's six people?

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.615
I don't keep a list.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:30.950
Why wouldn't you keep a list?

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:33.036
- We're in high school.
- Whoa. Why are you... What?

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.373
- Why are you getting so moody?
- You did say you were a virgin.

01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:39.250
I think you might've made an assumption.

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:43.634
I just had a whole experience
that was wrong.

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:46.181
- Look, you're deciding to be upset.
- No. I am upset.

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:48.351
Because you're deciding to be.
Don't be mad at me for this.

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:51.099
It's stupid. You can't be mad at me
for something I have no control over.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:53.101
I just wanted it to be special.

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:56.309
Why? You're gonna have so much
unspecial sex in your life.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:59.896
I was on top!
Who the fuck is on top their first time?

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:02.824
You have any, like, awareness of how many
civilians we've killed

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:05.322
- since the invasion in Iraq started...
- Shut up!

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:06.493
Shut up.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:10.247
Different things can be sad.
It's not all war.

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:22.214
Are we still going to prom together?

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:24.753
Sure.

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:50.780
I thought Miguel was gonna pick me up.

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:53.582
Well, I was just arriving from work
and it was easier.

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:56.619
You okay?

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.044
Aww, honey.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:02.295
He...

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:06.421
- Oh. Oh, it's okay.
- [sobbing]

01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:08.096
It's okay.

01:02:11.102 --> 01:02:12.764
What's this sweater?

01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:17.228
This is... My friend,
Jenna, gave it to me.

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:18.649
Who's Jenna?

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:19.896
My friend.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:26.983
You wanna do our favorite Sunday activity?

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.568
I don't have a second shift.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:32.279
Yeah.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:36.117
[guitar playing]

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.587
[music continues]

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:58.723
[music continues]

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:11.280
[music ends]

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.070
<i>[male report] The attack came in waves,</i>

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:16.828
<i>cruise missiles, followed by

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:20.002
<i>with so-called bunker buster bombs.</i>

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:22.045
<i>With target a bunker believed...</i>

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:24.715
Lady Bird, a bunch of things
arrived for you.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:25.791
Holy shit!

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:29.804
- Since when do you get mail?
- I get mail.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:35.180
Whatever you're up to,
it's not gonna end well.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.910
Yes!

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.590
[yells]

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.793
These programmers nowadays
are like kids, man.

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:10.219
I know.

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:13.969
But that's why I think with me,
you'll find something different.

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.846
Yeah, but they're like babies.

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:17.642
I hear you. It's wild.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:19.641
Which is why I went back to school

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:23.315
and got my MBA at UC Davis
while still working at ISC.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:25.017
Oh. [sputters]

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:26.977
- Wow. That must've been a lot of work.
- It was.

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:28.938
I heard ISC's closing now though.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:30.523
I heard. Yes.

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:34.611
So the assholes who fired you
are now closing up shop.

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:38.489
- Feels good.
- [laughs] Yeah.

01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:42.076
Uh...

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.746
What else is supposed to happen?

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:47.957
Oh, I, uh, thought we'd...

01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:50.585
talk about the position.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.670
How'd it go?

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:59.886
Let's go buy a big bag of Doritos
and eat them in the car

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:02.016
- to celebrate your wait list.
- Okay.

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:06.108
But don't tell Mom about the Doritos
or the wait list.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.981
- Hey.
- Hi, son.

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:10.779
Wait. What are you doing here?

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:12.822
Well, um...

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:15.367
I guess we're, uh,
going for the same job then.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.618
Looks like it.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:26.045
- Go get 'em.
- Thanks.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:29.001
- This-This way? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:37.598
I know it was you
who did the just married thing.

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:39.266
It wasn't me.

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:41.139
I'm not going to punish you.

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:42.686
Oh. Why not?

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.104
[Sister Joan chuckling]

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.271
It was funny.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:50.187
Sister Gina and I drove all the way home
before we noticed people were honking.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.567
- Really?
- [both laughing]

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:58.028
To be fair, I wasn't just married
to Jesus. It's been 40 years.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:05:59.362
Well, he's a lucky guy.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:00.867
[Sister Joan laughing]

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.619
I read your college essay.

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:07.875
You clearly love Sacramento.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:10.627
- I do?
- You write about Sacramento

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:13.425
so affectionately and with such care.

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.594
Well, I was just describing it.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.218
Well, it comes across as love.

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.800
Sure. I guess I pay attention.

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.804
Don't you think
they are maybe the same thing?

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:28.478
Love and attention?

01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:39.527
Guess you won't be
going to any dances in college.

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:41.237
This is our last one.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.914
You know Davis has a terrific theater

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.083
if you're still interested in theater.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.832
- Are ya?
- I'm probably no good at acting.

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:53.670
[exhales] Why don't I look like the girls
in the magazines?

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.548
It's too bad I can't meet
this Kyle before prom.

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:59.005
Well, he's not my boyfriend anymore.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.714
I mean, maybe he never even was.

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:02.265
Well, I'd still like to meet him.

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:05.644
It's too tight. Fuck.

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:10.183
Well, I suggested you not have
that second helping of pasta.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:13.144
- Mom.
- Honey, you seem upset about it

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:15.855
- and I'm trying to help.
- You're giving me an eating disorder.

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:18.737
[sighs] I wish
I could get an eating disorder.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.826
I love it.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.412
Is it too pink?

01:07:35.426 --> 01:07:36.416
What?

01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:43.136
Why can't you say I look nice?

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.097
I thought you didn't even care
what I think.

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:49.021
- I still want you to think I look good.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:51.690
I was telling you the truth.
You want me to lie?

01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:54.063
No. I mean, I just wish...

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:56.061
I just...

01:07:57.699 --> 01:07:59.235
I wish that you liked me.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.322
Of course I love you.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.122
But do you like me?

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:16.424
I want you to be the very best version
of yourself that you can be.

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:19.885
What if this is the best version?

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:35.609
You look really pretty.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:37.185
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.770
You look like a badass girl in a band.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:40.982
Thanks.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.404
[car honks]

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:44.984
Um...

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:47.196
I guess that's my date.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:51.078
You aren't gonna get in a car with a guy
who honks, are ya?

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:53.126
I think, yes, I am.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.462
Let me get your picture.

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.290
Your mom's pissed,
she had to work a double.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.125
Even you deserve better than this.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.344
[camera shutter clicks]

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.046
[Shelly] Have a good time.
