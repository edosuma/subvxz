WEBVTT

00:07.869 --> 00:08.836
We got another one.

00:08.870 --> 00:10.227
And you know what this is,
don't you?

00:10.251 --> 00:12.943
Dimensional key, y'all.

00:12.978 --> 00:14.014
And where did we get it?

00:14.048 --> 00:15.601
From a snake-sucking
fire serpent

00:15.636 --> 00:19.502
who got blown to space-chunks
by Hellcat and Stardragon.

00:19.536 --> 00:21.021
Kicking up
the nickname intensity.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.171
Feels like we could workshop
'em, but I like the gusto!

00:23.195 --> 00:25.197
Huzzah! Yeah, team squad!

00:25.232 --> 00:26.371
Yes!
Yes!

00:26.405 --> 00:28.338
My first high five.

00:28.373 --> 00:30.030
And it was a threesome.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.617
No one's going to believe me.

00:31.652 --> 00:33.343
I've got all this
bottled up energy

00:33.378 --> 00:34.862
over getting one of these,

00:34.896 --> 00:36.115
and I don't know
how to release it.

00:36.139 --> 00:37.451
Chookity? Gross!

00:37.485 --> 00:38.911
Alright, that's a different
kind of energy.

00:38.935 --> 00:40.626
Alright, I...
We'll talk about that later.

00:40.661 --> 00:42.594
But I need music.
Ear fuel!

00:42.628 --> 00:44.699
I'm taking real hard-core stuff.

00:44.734 --> 00:48.117
Chookity! I need a hit of "Loggins."

00:48.151 --> 00:49.601
What the hell is a Loggins?

00:49.635 --> 00:50.878
Here.
Get real close to me.

00:50.912 --> 00:51.982
Hmm?
Come here.

00:52.017 --> 00:53.191
Get, like, super close.

00:53.225 --> 00:54.226
Closer.
Hmm?

00:54.261 --> 00:56.228
Even close... There you go.

00:56.263 --> 00:58.644
There must be music
on Ventrexia,

00:58.679 --> 01:02.303
that, like, when you hear it,
you can't help but just explode.

01:02.338 --> 01:04.373
Chookity! Where is your mind right now?

01:04.409 --> 01:06.445
No. No!
I mean dancing.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.208
Well, maybe the ship
has a bit of "Loggins."

01:10.242 --> 01:12.382
Pssh.
No way, it's too old.

01:12.417 --> 01:14.419
Searching.Hmm.

01:14.453 --> 01:15.741
Are you referring to
the referring

01:15.765 --> 01:17.560
to the Loggins, comma, Kenneth?

01:17.594 --> 01:20.080
Because I have
his entire catalog.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.434 --> 01:33.231
Loggins!
No!

01:35.785 --> 01:38.339
I don't know what this is,
but I like it.

01:38.374 --> 01:41.411
What's happening?
Am I dying?

01:41.446 --> 01:43.310
Oh, please say yes.

01:43.344 --> 01:45.588
Oh, no.
Loggins.

01:45.622 --> 01:48.625
It's going to get intense fast.

02:16.032 --> 02:18.828
Gary!

02:25.731 --> 02:29.459
- Get it, H.U.E.
- Oh, I've got it bad, Gary.

02:29.494 --> 02:32.324
Uh-oh, I'm gonna cut loose.

02:35.016 --> 02:37.018
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

02:37.053 --> 02:38.088
- Mnh-mnh.
- Come on.

02:38.123 --> 02:40.470
Mnh-mnh.
Ooh!

02:49.514 --> 02:52.068
You're playing so cool

02:52.102 --> 02:54.691
Obeying every rule

02:54.726 --> 02:57.522
Deep way down in your heart

03:02.906 --> 03:04.218
Urgent.

03:04.253 --> 03:06.220
Collision with space-time
anomaly imminent.

03:06.255 --> 03:09.327
It appears to be
solid shards of time.

03:09.361 --> 03:12.226
Avoid impact at all costs.

03:12.261 --> 03:14.332
I got this.

03:14.366 --> 03:19.026
Hitting any one of them can
cause a disruption in time.

03:19.060 --> 03:22.029
If you need a partner assist,
just let me know.

03:28.449 --> 03:30.589
See?
Piece of cake.

03:30.624 --> 03:32.798
It seems we have cleared the...

03:41.255 --> 03:43.257
Gary!

04:51.014 --> 04:53.431
Yo, you get that filament?

04:53.465 --> 04:56.192
Yeah. Alright, baby.

04:56.226 --> 05:00.438
Okay, there has to be a less
sexy setting for that voice box.

05:06.271 --> 05:07.341
What?
Who is it?

05:07.376 --> 05:09.723
Hello? Will I kill you?
Yes, I will!

05:09.757 --> 05:11.794
Chill, Tribore.
I got what I need.

05:11.828 --> 05:13.140
Just passing through.

05:13.174 --> 05:15.453
No need for the crossbow.

05:15.487 --> 05:18.145
There's always
a need for a crossbow.

05:34.403 --> 05:37.026
Miss you, man.

05:45.759 --> 05:47.657
Ooh!
Death cookies.

05:47.692 --> 05:50.246
I like it.
Yum!

05:56.597 --> 05:58.185
Little Cato!

05:58.219 --> 06:00.498
You're just in time
for your rations.

06:00.532 --> 06:03.673
H.U.E.'s
famous plant cakes.

06:03.708 --> 06:05.226
You mean, infamous.

06:05.261 --> 06:06.366
Shut up, wife!

06:06.400 --> 06:08.298
Why did I marry you?

06:08.333 --> 06:10.404
Oh, you know why.

06:11.923 --> 06:14.374
My man H.U.E.
is nasty!

06:14.408 --> 06:17.100
That's why I can't get enough.

06:17.135 --> 06:21.035
Little Cato, isn't this stuff
that killed Fox and Ash?

06:21.070 --> 06:24.280
You can't prove that.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.189
Yes!

06:40.641 --> 06:42.712
Hey, son.
What's up, Dad?

06:42.747 --> 06:43.920
Did you get it?

06:43.955 --> 06:45.888
Got the last piece. That a boy.

06:45.922 --> 06:48.649
I'm proud of you.

06:53.792 --> 06:56.554
Why? We're trapped in here
because of me.

06:56.588 --> 06:58.141
It's been 60 years.

06:58.176 --> 07:00.247
You have to forgive yourself.

07:00.281 --> 07:01.490
I can't.

07:01.524 --> 07:03.630
You were Gary's partner.

07:03.664 --> 07:05.735
I'm just a stupid kid
who steered him hard

07:05.770 --> 07:07.461
into an early grave.

07:07.496 --> 07:08.738
You're a Cato.

07:08.773 --> 07:10.015
They don't mope.
They do.

07:10.050 --> 07:12.121
You made a mistake, son.

07:12.155 --> 07:14.503
Now stop beating yourself up.

07:19.197 --> 07:21.337
I am insane.

07:23.063 --> 07:25.652
You'll make it up to them.

07:25.686 --> 07:29.414
I believe in you.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.936
Aye.
Little Avo-Cato.

07:33.970 --> 07:36.939
You gonna be talking to your
dead dad all day long?

07:36.973 --> 07:38.665
Were you always this mean?

07:38.699 --> 07:40.252
'Cause that one hurt.

07:48.985 --> 07:50.677
I called you here for a reason.

07:50.711 --> 07:52.955
I've been working
on something in secret...

07:52.989 --> 07:54.715
something big.

07:54.750 --> 07:57.891
Well, kiss my cheeks, chums.

07:57.925 --> 07:59.893
It's me!

07:59.927 --> 08:01.860
Not again, man.
Come on.

08:01.895 --> 08:04.242
Clarence, take off
my freaking friend.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.692
First of all, it's Glarence.

08:05.726 --> 08:08.729
And, second of all, come ooon!

08:08.764 --> 08:10.869
Glarence is a classic bit.

08:10.904 --> 08:13.527
People love it when I slip
this little sucker on.

08:13.562 --> 08:14.839
Right, everyone?

08:14.873 --> 08:17.082
I told you
to stop wearing my friend.

08:17.117 --> 08:18.256
Oh, calm down.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.706
It's not even real skin!

08:19.740 --> 08:21.639
I made it from 100 million worms

08:21.673 --> 08:23.537
I procured from
the plant cake cocoons

08:23.572 --> 08:25.056
that are killing
all of you slowly.

08:25.090 --> 08:27.403
You can't prove that. I like it!

08:27.437 --> 08:30.648
It reminds me of that guy who
used to do stuff around here?

08:30.682 --> 08:32.097
You know, the annoying one.

08:32.131 --> 08:34.099
What's his name? His name was Gary.

08:34.134 --> 08:37.171
No, it wasn't.
It was like Adam or Steven.

08:37.206 --> 08:38.552
Everyone, stop!

08:38.587 --> 08:42.211
Since we hit that time shard
and I got us stranded here,

08:42.245 --> 08:44.109
I've been working
on this distress beacon.

08:44.144 --> 08:46.733
It'll use the ship's power, and
we can shoot a message out there

08:46.767 --> 08:49.218
and if someone hears us
we could be saved.

08:49.252 --> 08:51.427
Our power reserves
are already low.

08:51.461 --> 08:54.085
Any more will drain
the oxygen supply.

08:54.119 --> 08:57.744
So we get to slowly die
of asphyxiation.

08:57.778 --> 09:01.264
Got my buns in a hot vice,
little buddy.

09:03.128 --> 09:04.371
Nothing?

09:04.405 --> 09:06.753
I know it's a risk, but...

09:06.787 --> 09:08.582
is this really living?

09:08.617 --> 09:09.928
I say we vote on it.

09:09.963 --> 09:11.723
There's an election night sash

09:11.758 --> 09:13.932
I've been waiting to wear
for 60 years now.

09:13.967 --> 09:15.382
Okay.

09:15.416 --> 09:19.282
This time tomorrow, we vote.

09:19.317 --> 09:22.216
I know my beacon can save us.

09:22.251 --> 09:23.597
But I need your support.

09:23.632 --> 09:25.599
Can I count on your vote,
Tribore?

09:25.634 --> 09:27.946
You can't have it?
Why?

09:27.981 --> 09:30.949
Because I'm working
on something, too.

09:30.984 --> 09:34.159
And my project's
super gonna save us!

09:40.269 --> 09:41.511
Hmm...

09:41.546 --> 09:46.068
and, uh, this is going
to help how?

09:46.102 --> 09:48.311
Not every detail's
been worked out.

09:48.346 --> 09:50.141
Oh.

09:50.175 --> 09:53.834
Has, uh, anydetail
been worked out?

09:53.869 --> 09:56.319
Not at this time, no.

10:10.851 --> 10:12.646
I could never burn you alive.

10:12.681 --> 10:14.165
Cool.
Great.

10:14.199 --> 10:16.857
I really think this distress
beacon idea is worth the risk.

10:16.892 --> 10:18.479
Any chance I could
change your mind?

10:18.514 --> 10:19.757
Mind?
No.

10:19.791 --> 10:21.655
You can't change my mind.

10:29.076 --> 10:32.562
Good talk.
I'm not really
gonna do it...

10:32.597 --> 10:34.185
Tonight?

10:34.219 --> 10:36.128
You're going to be stuck here
for the rest of your life

10:36.152 --> 10:38.707
if you can't make them
understand you.

10:38.741 --> 10:40.122
It's hard.

10:40.156 --> 10:42.055
Keep trying.

10:45.714 --> 10:47.405
Glarence...

10:49.752 --> 10:51.029
I'm no fool.

10:51.064 --> 10:53.204
If your plan fails,
all of us suffer.

10:53.238 --> 10:55.689
And if we don't try,
we're gonna die here anyway.

10:55.724 --> 10:57.208
I vote against!

10:57.242 --> 10:58.209
But why?

10:58.243 --> 11:01.039
How else am I supposed
to amuse myself?

11:01.074 --> 11:02.247
Martini?

11:02.282 --> 11:04.594
Clarence, we all know
that's your own piss.

11:04.629 --> 11:06.596
But is it really? Yes!

11:06.631 --> 11:08.702
One precious sip?

11:08.737 --> 11:12.913
It'll make all
your troubles just go away.

11:12.948 --> 11:14.363
No!

11:17.607 --> 11:19.402
You're such a disappointment.

11:19.437 --> 11:21.232
I know.

11:21.266 --> 11:23.372
That's the leader
I taught you to be?

11:23.406 --> 11:25.719
You couldn't even win
the trust of your crew.

11:25.754 --> 11:27.272
It's pathetic.

11:27.307 --> 11:28.584
You failed.

11:28.618 --> 11:30.068
I know.

11:34.659 --> 11:37.627
Came to tell you that I'm
for that crazy plan of yours.

11:37.662 --> 11:38.905
Why?

11:38.939 --> 11:41.217
Because that's what Gary
would have wanted.

11:41.252 --> 11:42.736
How do you know that?

11:42.771 --> 11:44.255
I just know.

11:44.289 --> 11:45.912
And I know your father
wouldn't have said

11:45.946 --> 11:48.742
any of those things
in a million years.

11:48.777 --> 11:49.847
Thanks.

11:49.881 --> 11:51.020
You got this.

11:51.055 --> 11:52.435
Now let's go do it.

11:52.470 --> 11:53.747
What about the others?

11:53.782 --> 11:55.645
Screw 'em.

12:05.794 --> 12:08.106
Alright.
I attached the beacon.

12:08.141 --> 12:10.281
Oh.
So no vote.

12:10.315 --> 12:11.800
Well, then goodbye sash.

12:11.834 --> 12:14.457
Rerouting power
to the distress beacon.

12:14.492 --> 12:16.390
Let this be good.

12:24.122 --> 12:27.298
Little Cato,
your device is working.

12:27.332 --> 12:28.920
Yeah.

12:28.955 --> 12:31.302
It is working.

12:40.518 --> 12:42.140
What's happening?

12:42.175 --> 12:44.798
I have detected a large mass
approaching our location.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.420
Is it a ship.

12:46.455 --> 12:48.457
It is far too big to be a ship.

12:48.491 --> 12:54.808
Then what is it? I am afraid it is a Titan.

13:00.193 --> 13:02.816
A Titan?
How is that even possible?

13:02.851 --> 13:04.369
They don't inhabit
this dimension.

13:04.404 --> 13:05.854
Unanswerable.

13:05.888 --> 13:09.305
Confrontation with Titan
in T-minus one minute.

13:09.340 --> 13:11.791
Prepare for
imminent destruction.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.309
Hear that, my man beast.

13:13.344 --> 13:16.657
She is as thoughtful
as she is insatiable.

13:22.974 --> 13:25.839
Oh, no.
The Titan is jostling the ship!

13:25.874 --> 13:27.461
And not gently.

13:27.496 --> 13:31.017
Well, it took you 60 years,
but you've finally killed us.

13:31.051 --> 13:34.744
If Gary were here,
he'd know what to do.

13:34.779 --> 13:36.850
Little Cato!
Little Cato!

13:36.885 --> 13:39.301
Gary, time is progressing
rapidly in there.

13:39.335 --> 13:40.681
How rapidly?!

13:40.716 --> 13:42.304
It's already been
60 years in there.

13:42.338 --> 13:45.169
If we do not break through,
it will be the end.

13:45.203 --> 13:46.653
Then start shooting!

13:55.524 --> 14:00.184
Uh, think!
What would Gary do?

14:00.218 --> 14:03.359
The better question is,
Little Cato, what would you do?

14:03.394 --> 14:04.774
That is a good question.

14:04.809 --> 14:06.776
I want to say shopping.

14:06.811 --> 14:08.261
But I know it's camping.

14:08.295 --> 14:10.539
Anything to get away
from this jostling.

14:10.573 --> 14:12.403
Uh, Nightfall.

14:12.437 --> 14:13.542
I'm over here.

14:13.576 --> 14:15.061
You've made some mistakes,

14:15.095 --> 14:17.580
but you've also made
a lot of good calls.

14:17.615 --> 14:19.720
But what if I screw
this up, too?

14:19.755 --> 14:21.205
We all die.

14:21.239 --> 14:23.448
But at least
you failed being you.

14:23.483 --> 14:26.279
And that's a victory
right there.

14:35.253 --> 14:38.670
Just where in the hell
do you think you're going?

14:40.949 --> 14:43.192
I'm gonna kill a Titan.

14:46.955 --> 14:48.232
Whoa!

14:48.266 --> 14:50.244
Did anyone else just get goose
bumps all over their forks?

14:50.268 --> 14:52.477
Y'all know I'm coming.

14:52.512 --> 14:54.100
I'm coming, too!

14:54.134 --> 14:55.480
Alright.

15:06.008 --> 15:07.941
Are we making any progress?

15:07.976 --> 15:10.875
Not enough.
Keep going!

15:12.670 --> 15:15.949
Hey, Gary.

15:15.984 --> 15:17.847
Keep an eye out, okay?

15:17.882 --> 15:20.920
Yay!
More death cookies!

15:20.954 --> 15:23.267
Ooh, there must be
a death cookie factory.

15:24.647 --> 15:26.063
What's the plan?

15:26.097 --> 15:28.513
Step one... Someone's got
to keep that Titan distracted.

15:28.548 --> 15:30.274
I can do that. You sure?

15:30.308 --> 15:33.104
'Cause, you know, you're, like,
a little, uh, blind.

15:33.139 --> 15:34.174
Blind?!

15:34.209 --> 15:35.969
Well, my other sense
are heightened.

15:36.004 --> 15:39.524
Watch and find out.

15:42.838 --> 15:44.288
Uh.

15:44.322 --> 15:46.462
Step two... Mooncake finds
a way into the Titan,

15:46.497 --> 15:48.671
then blasts that sucker's guts
out from the inside.

15:48.706 --> 15:52.123
I'd suggest the mouth hole, but,
you know, any orifice will do.

15:52.158 --> 15:54.470
It is on!

15:54.505 --> 15:58.681
Little Cato, I see no version
of this where you survive.

15:58.716 --> 16:00.649
You can't fight a Titan.

16:00.683 --> 16:02.858
What are you trying to prove?

16:06.413 --> 16:08.312
Everything.

16:22.912 --> 16:24.500
Ready?
Let's do this!

16:24.535 --> 16:25.846
Come get some!

16:27.779 --> 16:31.645
Ho, ho-kay!

16:31.680 --> 16:36.409
You're gonna remember this!

16:36.443 --> 16:38.376
Yeah!
That's right!

16:38.411 --> 16:41.586
Some of this! Come on! Let's go! Whoo!

16:41.621 --> 16:43.071
We are doin' this!

16:43.105 --> 16:46.039
Uh!

16:46.074 --> 16:48.731
Go, Mooncake!
Dittle his doggle!

16:55.083 --> 16:58.534
Yeah-he-he-he-ha!

17:05.954 --> 17:08.337
Nightfall, Little Cato is down.

17:08.372 --> 17:09.890
Man down.
Man down.

17:09.925 --> 17:12.893
Little Cato! Man down. Man down.

17:23.904 --> 17:25.699
H.U.E., how bad is it?

17:25.733 --> 17:28.288
Very bad. He's dying.

17:28.323 --> 17:29.462
He deserves to die.

17:29.496 --> 17:30.808
Shut up, Glarence.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.982
I don't think he's gonna
pull through.

17:33.017 --> 17:35.744
But I'm gonna put a little
Band-Aid right here.

17:35.778 --> 17:37.435
Right in this spot.

17:37.470 --> 17:40.749
Just to show I tried.

17:40.783 --> 17:45.133
I spent 60 years
trying to save us, and...

17:45.167 --> 17:46.651
nothing.

17:46.686 --> 17:48.653
Couldn't save my friends.

17:48.688 --> 17:52.001
I couldn't even save myself.

17:52.036 --> 17:56.316
I wish I had appreciated
our time together more.

17:56.351 --> 17:58.456
Crimson Light.
Signal received.

17:58.491 --> 18:00.493
Repeat, signal received.

18:00.527 --> 18:01.666
Please respond.

18:01.701 --> 18:03.289
That is a rescue ship.

18:03.323 --> 18:05.463
Cato, they're here.

18:05.498 --> 18:06.844
You did it.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.984
Just hold on, okay?

18:09.018 --> 18:10.434
For me.

18:10.468 --> 18:12.781
For all of us.

18:12.815 --> 18:14.576
But also for you, too.

18:14.610 --> 18:18.097
I don't know what I would've
done without you all.

18:18.131 --> 18:23.032
Probably gone...

18:23.067 --> 18:26.312
crazy.

18:26.346 --> 18:28.693
We did it, right?

18:28.728 --> 18:30.868
Yeah, good job, Little Cato.

18:30.902 --> 18:34.251
Yeah, good job, Little Cato.

18:34.285 --> 18:37.806
Thanks, but I can't take
the credit.

18:39.394 --> 18:41.534
It was all of us.

18:46.228 --> 18:48.265
Gary, more firepower!

18:48.299 --> 18:49.300
I've run the numbers.

18:49.335 --> 18:51.199
If we reverse the drop drive,

18:51.233 --> 18:53.994
Ash can harness that power and
redirect it at the barrier.

18:54.029 --> 18:57.066
It could be just enough
to save Little Cato.

18:57.101 --> 18:59.724
Sounds horrifying.
Let's give it a go.

18:59.759 --> 19:01.036
Are you sure it will work?

19:01.070 --> 19:03.003
I hope so, I like the kid.

19:03.038 --> 19:06.179
But just to make sure,
let's run it past Richard.

19:06.214 --> 19:07.801
Enough with freakin'
Richard, alright?

19:07.836 --> 19:10.804
Nobody cares about your dumb
friend, Richard, alright?

19:10.839 --> 19:15.395
Okay, Ash.
Give it everything you got!

19:15.430 --> 19:18.709
Engage the drop drive!

19:21.332 --> 19:23.092
Aaah!

19:53.813 --> 19:54.952
It's really you.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.265
I thought you were dead.

19:57.299 --> 19:58.542
Oh no, are we both dead?

19:58.576 --> 20:00.233
If you're dead, I'm dead.

20:00.268 --> 20:03.547
And if I'm dead,
I'm going to kill you.

20:03.581 --> 20:05.100
You're not.
You're back.

20:05.134 --> 20:08.379
And so is KVN.
Did I miss anything?

20:08.414 --> 20:10.864
I was alone for so long.

20:10.899 --> 20:12.625
For 60 years...

20:12.659 --> 20:14.696
Wait.
Are you saying you remember?

20:14.730 --> 20:16.422
You remember
what happened in there?

20:16.456 --> 20:17.595
Ugh.

20:17.630 --> 20:20.149
Yeah.
All of it.

20:20.184 --> 20:21.220
Dang.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.877
Loneliness is the worst, man.

20:23.912 --> 20:26.604
I'm just glad you're okay.

20:26.639 --> 20:29.642
You areokay, right?

20:29.676 --> 20:31.713
Thanks, everyone.

20:31.747 --> 20:33.611
For not giving up on me.

20:45.934 --> 20:47.418
Hey, son.

20:47.453 --> 20:52.768
Dad, how would you feel if I
kinda put this away for a while?

20:52.803 --> 20:54.770
'Bout time.

20:54.805 --> 20:58.326
Yeah, it's about time.
