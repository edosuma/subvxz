WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:04.999
- Previously, on Being Human...
- Who did this to you?

00:05.030 --> 00:07.670
- Let's just say I didn't
always go for the nice guy.

00:07.700 --> 00:08.770
- I'm a wolf too.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.006
We're purebreds, Josh.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.906
- You guys wanna be
wolves all the time.

00:11.940 --> 00:13.669
- How much are
you around humans?

00:13.710 --> 00:14.871
- Never saw a reason to.

00:14.910 --> 00:17.277
- I did, and you just
let him walk away.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.512
- When you turned me,

00:20.550 --> 00:22.985
you made it seem like
steak dinners and chorus girls.

00:23.020 --> 00:25.284
This is one step up
from a breadline.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.254
We can have what they have.

00:27.290 --> 00:30.021
- (Mobster): I heard about your
little orphan problem too.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.585
- I need my blood.

00:31.630 --> 00:32.927
- Bishop built up his army

00:32.960 --> 00:35.520
and Mother's just
gonna kill us all.

00:35.560 --> 00:38.222
- What's he doing?
- He's coming back to us.

00:48.310 --> 00:50.039
- (Aidan):
At the end of the day,

00:50.080 --> 00:54.244
all any of us wants
is to feel good.

00:56.050 --> 00:58.985
And whether it's a long,
wet kiss on a dark night

00:59.020 --> 01:01.580
or a needle in the arm,

01:01.620 --> 01:04.555
it'll gnaw at you
until you give in...

01:04.590 --> 01:05.989
(Knocking on door)

01:06.030 --> 01:07.725
- Room service.

01:07.760 --> 01:08.898
Come in!

01:08.930 --> 01:12.434
- ...until you let yourself
feel good again.

01:20.340 --> 01:22.342
- You can't be
full already.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.743
(Aidan roaring)

01:25.810 --> 01:27.346
(Panting)

01:30.050 --> 01:32.041
(Moaning)

01:34.360 --> 01:36.283
(Breathing heavily)

01:37.330 --> 01:38.729
(Sighs, laughing)

01:38.760 --> 01:42.594
- And there is nothing else
in the world that feels better

01:42.630 --> 01:46.294
than giving in
to your inner monster.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.461
- Hey, who said it was
time to get dressed?

01:51.510 --> 01:53.274
- I can't help it.

01:53.310 --> 01:56.541
I just love the way
it feels on my skin.

01:56.580 --> 01:59.914
It's silk chiffon, OK?

01:59.950 --> 02:00.849
And I'm not the one

02:00.880 --> 02:03.315
who has to hand wash
it in the morning, so...

02:03.350 --> 02:04.647
- What?

02:04.690 --> 02:06.454
- Or I could
just stay naked,

02:06.490 --> 02:08.481
if you like me
better like that.

02:09.490 --> 02:10.958
(Giggling)

02:12.960 --> 02:14.894
- Measuring neurotransmitters

02:14.930 --> 02:16.523
during each phase
of the moon

02:16.570 --> 02:19.562
and then using that data
to optimize serotonin levels

02:19.600 --> 02:22.638
could help reduce the pain
of the actual change.

02:22.670 --> 02:25.469
It's a start anyway.
Thanks to your generosity.

02:25.510 --> 02:28.002
- Connor's always throwing
our money around.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.542
Better you than
champagne rooms.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.400
- (Nora): How?

02:32.520 --> 02:34.010
How exactly do
you plan to

02:34.050 --> 02:37.384
measure neurotransmitters
and optimize serotonin levels?

02:37.420 --> 02:40.981
Because there's one actual
medical professional in the room

02:41.020 --> 02:43.626
and she doesn't remember
volunteering to be a lab rat.

02:43.660 --> 02:47.654
- Well, you'd just
pee in a cup.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.328
- Well, then I hope my wolf
has some damn good aim.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.793
- I share your
frustrations, Nora. I do.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.491
But what Josh really needs
right now is our patience.

02:55.540 --> 02:57.963
- I'm sorry, but I met
you all of 3 minutes ago.

02:58.010 --> 03:00.980
You're trying to put an end
to a century's old curse

03:01.010 --> 03:02.500
with a video camera
that you snagged

03:02.550 --> 03:05.008
from our 12-year-old
neighbour's garage sale

03:05.050 --> 03:07.815
and some seed money originally
earmarked for an exotic dancer.

03:07.850 --> 03:10.649
You are a werewolf, Josh.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.250
And you're
kidding yourself.

03:13.290 --> 03:14.587
- Nora...

03:14.620 --> 03:16.224
(Sighs)

03:41.420 --> 03:43.684
- Till next time...

03:52.900 --> 03:56.564
- Every monster has their
own version of an addiction.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.967
It's written into our nature.

04:02.070 --> 04:07.270
We need the blood,
the strength, the power.

04:12.380 --> 04:16.317
But the curse of those
of us with darker urges

04:16.350 --> 04:20.583
is that when we let the
cravings inside us take over,

04:20.620 --> 04:22.930
someone else pays the price.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.260
- Did you miss it?

04:31.070 --> 04:32.799
Did you miss me?

04:37.970 --> 04:41.304
- We don't have to fit
80 years into a week.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.941
We've had enough.
There's work to be done.

04:45.980 --> 04:48.813
- Your tolerance isn't
what it used to be.

04:50.850 --> 04:53.717
There's work to be
done there as well.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.521
(Fangs clicking)

05:04.600 --> 05:06.261
(Gasping)

05:06.300 --> 05:09.361
- And when a monster sets
sail for rock bottom,

05:09.410 --> 05:11.469
there's no telling
what destruction

05:11.510 --> 05:13.933
he'll leave in his wake.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.513
(Birds chirping)

05:27.560 --> 05:29.585
- Rough night?

05:29.630 --> 05:30.984
(Laughing)

05:31.030 --> 05:33.590
See, it's funny because
you're noncorporeal,

05:33.630 --> 05:36.224
completely unable to
do things like drag race

05:36.260 --> 05:38.592
or take that last
ill-advised Jagerbomb.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.359
- I got it. Thanks.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.301
- Although, even the very first
Jagerbomb"s ill-advised.

05:43.340 --> 05:45.832
Did you know that they're banned
in certain parts of Australia

05:45.870 --> 05:49.545
because of the effect
the stimulant/depressant combo

05:49.580 --> 05:51.207
has on the--

05:53.550 --> 05:54.972
Wow!

05:55.020 --> 05:55.976
- It's really that bad?

05:56.020 --> 05:58.717
- No, not if you
intend your face

05:58.750 --> 06:01.287
- to colour coordinate
with your snugly cardigan.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.823
- I wonder what the other
vamps would think about

06:03.860 --> 06:06.249
your intimate knowledge
of women's separates.

06:06.290 --> 06:08.452
- So seriously though,
what happened to you?

06:08.500 --> 06:09.695
- Nothing.

06:09.730 --> 06:12.324
I just, uh...
I had fun last night.

06:12.370 --> 06:15.340
- I thought we were all far
too tortured to have fun.

06:15.370 --> 06:16.667
- Yeah, and that's why

06:17.610 --> 06:18.736
I've been experimenting
with people.

06:18.770 --> 06:21.603
Well, not just
people really.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.971
One person. A woman.

06:23.010 --> 06:24.842
Dr. Forest's
girlfriend, Janet.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.439
- Oh, Tim Forest
has a girlfriend!

06:26.480 --> 06:28.574
Cindy in peds is
gonna be crushed.

06:28.620 --> 06:29.940
- For how long?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.015
- You know,
it seems innocent enough.

06:32.050 --> 06:36.260
Dinner and a movie,
maybe a little walk afterwards,

06:36.290 --> 06:38.224
argue over whether
or not 3-D is leading

06:38.260 --> 06:40.456
to the inevitable downfall
of modern cinema.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.299
Maybe some fro yo.
- We talked about abbreviating.

06:43.330 --> 06:44.400
- Sleeping with him?

06:44.430 --> 06:45.829
- Sleeping with him!

06:48.540 --> 06:51.760
Excuse me! You're using this
poor woman's body to have sex--

06:51.810 --> 06:52.971
- With her hot boyfriend

06:53.010 --> 06:55.331
that she already wants
to have sex with.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.371
You know you're an
epic buzz kill, right?

06:57.410 --> 06:58.969
- This possession stuff,
it is addictive.

06:59.010 --> 07:01.240
But you know that already.
Look at you.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.419
- Really? How's your
track record lately?

07:03.450 --> 07:05.839
Because you sure don't
look hungry anymore.

07:05.890 --> 07:06.982
- That's just deflection.

07:07.020 --> 07:08.818
- Eat me, Josh!

07:08.860 --> 07:10.624
- Eat you or the meat suit
that you're possessing?

07:10.660 --> 07:14.449
- It's just sex, OK? Fine.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.026
Yeah, I'll put an end to the
greatest time I ever had.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.391
I'll stay in my own
intangible body.

07:19.430 --> 07:21.034
I'll learn to love
my yoga pants and

07:21.070 --> 07:22.959
try to forget what it
is to sprawl naked

07:23.010 --> 07:25.001
in a bed with
another human being.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.530
Is that what
you wanna hear?

07:35.480 --> 07:37.915
- I can't believe
you convinced me

07:37.950 --> 07:39.554
to change my shift.

07:47.530 --> 07:51.797
- No earthly man can resist
my powers of persuasion.

07:51.830 --> 07:54.037
Besides, you work too much.

07:54.070 --> 07:57.267
- Oh, says the single-minded
career woman.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.005
- Well, sure. Sure.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.431
My job is very
important to me.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.902
So important.

08:05.950 --> 08:08.271
All those, um..

08:09.890 --> 08:11.517
Work thingies.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.517
(Laughs)

08:14.560 --> 08:17.257
- Babe, don't take this
the wrong way 'cause,

08:17.290 --> 08:19.349
you and me,
things are great.

08:19.390 --> 08:21.893
- Me too... babe.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.391
- But lately, you've been,

08:26.430 --> 08:30.469
I don't know,
different somehow.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.279
- When I was a kid,

08:45.320 --> 08:49.416
my dad used to take me
to this Firemen's Carnival

08:49.460 --> 08:53.522
with the rides that looked
like they'd collapse

08:53.560 --> 08:55.494
if a bolt came loose.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.492
And I never wanted to leave.

09:02.340 --> 09:06.231
I wanted that feeling to
last for as long as it could.

09:11.310 --> 09:13.540
I feel more myself
in this bed with you

09:13.580 --> 09:15.116
than I have in years.

09:20.590 --> 09:22.217
I mean, um,

09:23.190 --> 09:25.989
not that any of that
actually happened, uh...

09:27.600 --> 09:29.989
It's more like a metaphor.

09:30.030 --> 09:34.399
No, wait, not a metaphor,
like a fable.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.566
No.

09:36.340 --> 09:39.002
I don't know.
I'm not a writer.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.371
(Gasps)

09:40.410 --> 09:41.809
Wait, maybe I am a--

09:55.960 --> 09:57.951
Till next time...

10:19.310 --> 10:20.914
(Clears throat)

10:27.460 --> 10:29.679
You gotta be kidding me.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.664
(Horns honking)

10:49.610 --> 10:51.977
- He doesn't wish
to be disturbed.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.684
(Moaning loudly)

10:58.690 --> 10:59.760
- My maker!

11:00.790 --> 11:02.781
This is...

11:02.830 --> 11:06.949
Well, to be honest, the best
I could locate in a pinch.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.959
Introductions were brief
and altogether nameless.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.695
- Suren is a royal,

11:14.740 --> 11:17.903
a very high-strung,
very possessive royal!

11:17.940 --> 11:20.432
- I'm well aware of her
delicate disposition.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.240
- Why would you
be so foolish?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.078
- When you made me,

11:26.110 --> 11:29.478
you never warned me how
much I'd enjoy myself.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.822
- Let's hope that your
stupidity is due to your youth.

11:42.870 --> 11:46.591
But Suren was made
almost 700 years ago.

11:46.630 --> 11:48.132
She may seem like
a Vanderbilt to you,

11:48.170 --> 11:49.899
but she has
the blood of warriors.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.908
-So do I.

11:51.940 --> 11:54.329
I was doing us a favour.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.576
They need to know,
Mother and the rest,

11:56.610 --> 11:58.339
that we're not so
far from them.

11:58.380 --> 11:59.609
- That's how you prove it?

11:59.650 --> 12:01.243
By making with
every dame you see?

12:01.280 --> 12:04.386
- Is this about me
or your own regret?

12:07.790 --> 12:09.713
- It's because of Suren

12:10.730 --> 12:13.051
that I spared you.

12:22.740 --> 12:25.300
See to it that
she doesn't regret it.

12:32.110 --> 12:35.410
- We need to sit down
with Cecilia.

12:35.450 --> 12:38.750
Bishop's old guard
is giving her a hard time.

12:38.790 --> 12:40.849
What a bore.

12:41.820 --> 12:44.255
I've been gone for
most of the century

12:44.290 --> 12:46.759
and men are still pissing
all over everything.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.792
- How are you
still speaking?

12:49.830 --> 12:50.991
I'm twice your size.

12:51.030 --> 12:54.762
The amount that
we've had to drink...

12:54.800 --> 12:58.304
- I'm more than
twice your age, pet.

13:01.980 --> 13:04.677
I'll talk to
Cecilia tomorrow.

13:05.680 --> 13:07.614
But now...

13:12.490 --> 13:13.810
- No, wait, wait, wait.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.557
Is that why cleanups
were backed up last week?

13:16.590 --> 13:18.479
- I'm taking care of it.

13:18.530 --> 13:21.659
- When? We haven't
left this hotel.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.726
- Women know how
to multitask.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.666
(Bell ringing)

13:34.680 --> 13:36.432
- (Aidan):
Is that the alarm?

13:37.610 --> 13:39.942
- This had better be good.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.919
Mother...

13:55.200 --> 13:57.794
Henry, we have to leave--

13:59.230 --> 14:01.062
(Women screaming)

14:08.980 --> 14:11.642
- You're looking fresh.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.274
A happy side effect of
ignoring your responsibilities?

14:15.980 --> 14:18.312
- Word didn't reach you
at the lake house?

14:18.350 --> 14:20.751
We've been quite busy.

14:20.790 --> 14:22.087
- Yes.

14:23.190 --> 14:25.989
- The hotel is thriving.

14:26.030 --> 14:29.056
People from Iowa seem
to love a checkered past.

14:29.100 --> 14:32.263
The police force
is in check.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.395
- So the spike
in murder is dense.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.930
- We're handling it.

14:36.970 --> 14:38.040
- Of course.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.099
Tell me, was my command

14:41.140 --> 14:44.974
that the illegitimates
be culled in some way unclear?

14:45.010 --> 14:47.172
- They've gone into hiding.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.190
Drawing them out
has been impossible.

14:50.220 --> 14:54.088
- Perhaps if you prioritized
business over pleasure.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.920
Leave us.

15:00.060 --> 15:03.621
My daughter and I are overdue
for a heart to heart.

15:09.770 --> 15:13.104
Your release
was a gift, Suren.

15:13.140 --> 15:15.074
An unearned privilege.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.430
(Scoffs)

15:17.080 --> 15:20.118
- My release was a test.

15:20.980 --> 15:24.939
Sending Aidan,
bringing me back here.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.084
- A daughter of mine
should know how to rule,

15:27.120 --> 15:28.053
whatever the circumstances.

15:28.090 --> 15:30.149
- Because you clawed
your way up from nothing.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.954
Yes, I know.

15:31.990 --> 15:35.995
Mother Builds an Empire was
your favourite bedtime story.

15:36.030 --> 15:38.965
What did you think I
was doing all that time

15:39.000 --> 15:41.469
in that cold
black nothing?

15:41.500 --> 15:44.162
Humming Cole Porter
to myself?

15:45.210 --> 15:47.178
I know what I'm doing.

15:50.310 --> 15:51.709
I could've spun
this town into gold

15:51.750 --> 15:53.718
and you would've
still found fault.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.218
If we are
pretending to care

15:55.250 --> 15:57.685
about Bishop's
pathetic orphans, fine!

15:57.720 --> 15:58.881
- They're organizing!

16:00.060 --> 16:03.985
Thanks to you, they've had
time to learn how to survive

16:04.030 --> 16:04.883
and to fight.

16:06.130 --> 16:10.089
But it seems you're traipsing
down Aidan's path of mercy.

16:10.130 --> 16:14.363
What a pleasure to watch a man
twist your mind... again.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.165
- I didn't choose
who dug me up. You did!

16:22.180 --> 16:24.000
(Siren)

16:24.050 --> 16:26.075
(Phone ringing)

16:27.980 --> 16:29.709
- Josh!

16:29.750 --> 16:31.184
I'm stuck.

16:33.090 --> 16:35.650
- Sure you are, ma'am.
I'll just page psych.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.328
- Josh, it's me, Sally!

16:38.860 --> 16:39.986
You're Josh Levinson

16:40.030 --> 16:42.294
and your favourite TOS
movie is Search for Spock,

16:42.330 --> 16:45.061
but you tell people it's
Wrath of Khan to save face.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.990
I'm Sally Malick and I need
to get out of this body.

16:54.380 --> 16:57.680
- I must have done it too much
or stayed in too long.

16:57.710 --> 17:00.748
And I was so weak going into it.
And it's harder to get out!

17:00.780 --> 17:02.942
And I just-- I came here
looking for Zoe and then she...

17:05.250 --> 17:09.084
Wow! You are, like,
completely hairless.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.758
- No, I'm not!

17:10.790 --> 17:12.280
You promised
you would stop.

17:12.329 --> 17:15.128
- I lied, OK? I lied.
I really like him, Josh.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.650
- Who? Dr. Forest?

17:16.700 --> 17:19.123
He's-- Sally, he's on
an amateur jai-alai team.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.240
- He's from Connecticut.

17:20.270 --> 17:22.295
- Yes, and he's human!

17:22.339 --> 17:24.205
And he thinks
your name is...

17:24.240 --> 17:25.935
- Janet.
- Janet!

17:25.970 --> 17:27.676
Are you listening
to yourself?

17:27.710 --> 17:29.530
Or are auditory challenges
part of the pleasure

17:29.580 --> 17:31.742
that comes with
wearing Janet's head?

17:31.780 --> 17:33.441
- Maybe it has
something to do

17:33.480 --> 17:35.949
with the whole first intimate
connection with a person

17:35.980 --> 17:37.050
since my untimely death.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.912
Maybe that's clouded
my judgment a little bit.

17:39.950 --> 17:40.883
- No, no.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.582
You've lost
all judgment, Sally.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.155
You're addicted to it.

17:46.430 --> 17:47.397
So what now?

17:47.430 --> 17:51.367
So now you just possess
this poor woman forever?

17:53.970 --> 17:55.199
- Janet?

17:55.240 --> 17:58.232
Hey! What are
you doing here?

17:58.270 --> 17:59.738
- Uh...

18:01.280 --> 18:03.442
- Have we met?
- Us? No.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.609
Well, I usually
clean up the floor

18:06.650 --> 18:08.744
after you're done spilling
all the blood all over it.

18:08.780 --> 18:11.215
So, no, I don't
think we've actually...

18:11.250 --> 18:13.389
Not that your surgeries
are unusually bloody.

18:13.420 --> 18:16.913
It's just that's what
happens here in the hospital.

18:16.960 --> 18:17.927
- I was just...

18:17.960 --> 18:21.157
I was asking this guy
where your office was.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.067
- You know I don't
have an office.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.990
Aren't you meeting my mom
back at my place?

18:27.030 --> 18:28.464
I have that surgery now.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.036
- Sure! Your mother.

18:30.070 --> 18:33.040
Yeah! Yeah, sure!
Of course.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.970
- I've got a little
bit of time.

18:35.010 --> 18:37.149
How about I walk you
back to the apartment?

18:37.180 --> 18:39.148
- OK.
- OK.

18:42.620 --> 18:43.348
Janet?

18:43.390 --> 18:44.243
- Yeah! Coming!

18:47.520 --> 18:48.590
- Bye.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.921
(Beeping)

18:55.000 --> 18:57.469
- I'm sorry, but I'm
awfully busy curing people

18:57.500 --> 18:59.923
using scientific
nonhypothetical procedures.

18:59.970 --> 19:02.598
- I understand your skepticism,
Nora. It's just that--

19:02.640 --> 19:04.961
- I don't think we
understand each other at all.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.104
Josh told me everything.

19:07.140 --> 19:08.278
- Mm-hmm.

19:08.310 --> 19:10.642
- I'm a mutt.
You're a purebred.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.945
So while my lowest
of werewolf social orders

19:13.980 --> 19:16.074
forces me to hold down
an actual job

19:16.120 --> 19:18.646
and save my OT
for a bubble bath,

19:18.690 --> 19:21.489
you spend your days living
it up at Wolf Castle,

19:21.520 --> 19:23.454
or whatever it is you do.

19:23.490 --> 19:25.629
- We're all more alike
than you think.

19:25.660 --> 19:27.253
And Brynn and I
just wanna help.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.099
- But Josh doesn't
wanna be a wolf.

19:30.130 --> 19:33.668
He wants to be normal,
more than anything.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.169
And I don't like you
taking advantage of him.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.306
- Nora, that is not
what you're afraid of.

19:39.340 --> 19:43.106
You're afraid that if
Josh does find the cure...

19:43.140 --> 19:44.278
(Sighs)

19:44.310 --> 19:46.039
...he'll make you
take it too.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.650
- Look, I hate to say it,

19:55.690 --> 19:58.421
but it'll be better
without my father around.

19:59.730 --> 20:03.098
- Because he's, um...
- On that golf retreat.

20:03.130 --> 20:04.894
(Tim chuckles)

20:06.270 --> 20:09.240
Relax. That was the whole
point of you meeting Mom here.

20:09.270 --> 20:12.035
So that we could be casual
and put last time behind us.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.570
- No...

20:17.610 --> 20:18.941
- She's my mother.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.448
- Stay away from me.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.879
- What?

20:26.590 --> 20:28.115
- Stay away.

20:29.160 --> 20:32.027
I said stay the
hell away from me!

20:32.060 --> 20:33.949
- Janet!
- Ah!

20:36.730 --> 20:39.324
- Janet, are you OK?

20:42.470 --> 20:44.108
- I think so.

20:44.140 --> 20:45.608
- What the hell
just happened?

20:45.640 --> 20:46.937
- I don't know.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.678
- Will?

20:54.720 --> 20:56.449
- Hey.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.017
I'm sorry to just show up
like this at your work.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.610
- Yeah, no, you--you
can't just show up here.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.129
- I saw you the
other day on Salem,

21:04.160 --> 21:05.457
near the hardware store.

21:05.490 --> 21:06.560
Then again last night.

21:06.590 --> 21:10.663
I was coming out of the bar
with Dean and Suzie...

21:10.700 --> 21:11.462
- How are they?

21:11.500 --> 21:13.161
- Fine. They're good.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.089
Actually, I thought
you saw me too.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.892
- No.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.599
- Look, it's...
It's fine.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.301
I get it.

21:21.340 --> 21:24.173
I guess I wouldn't
talk to me either.

21:24.210 --> 21:26.872
It's just seeing you...

21:28.150 --> 21:31.518
Look, I just need you to
know that I'm sorry, OK?

21:31.550 --> 21:33.279
I've changed.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.719
- No, Will. No.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.580
We can't do this.

21:36.620 --> 21:38.156
- (Josh): Nora?

21:40.560 --> 21:42.324
- Josh...

21:43.370 --> 21:46.226
This is Will,

21:46.270 --> 21:47.669
my ex.

21:51.740 --> 21:54.380
- How could you even let him
near you after what he did?

21:54.410 --> 21:57.209
- Because maybe I don't wanna
feel like that all the time.

21:57.240 --> 22:01.017
- Feel what? Justifiably
threatened, scared?

22:01.050 --> 22:02.211
- I'm done
talking about this.

22:02.250 --> 22:05.015
- The guy goes hat in hand for
one 2-minute conversation

22:05.050 --> 22:07.656
and you've forgiven him for
landing you in a hospital bed?

22:07.690 --> 22:10.250
- Listen to yourself.
- Listen to me?

22:10.290 --> 22:14.193
- You're supposed to be
the nice-guy alternative?

22:14.230 --> 22:16.949
You know what? Let's
not do this right now.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.162
Tonight's the full moon.
We're both on edge.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.167
- You're right.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.999
A waning moon will
definitely make your reunion

22:23.040 --> 22:26.032
with your psycho ex-boyfriend
a lot more palatable to me.

22:29.980 --> 22:31.903
(Horns honking)

22:31.950 --> 22:35.215
- We're angry too, Josh.
He hurt one of our own.

22:35.250 --> 22:38.185
- Nora is not yours.

22:38.220 --> 22:40.609
- You know, he's right.

22:40.660 --> 22:44.187
Avenging Nora is
Josh's responsibility.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.289
The dude's a
contractor, right?

22:46.330 --> 22:48.059
It won't take
much to find him.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.955
- I'm not like
the two of you.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.968
- But you've seen
him now, Josh.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.139
All right? This Will.

22:54.170 --> 22:56.969
And every night that
you lie with her in bed

22:57.000 --> 23:00.300
and your hand brushes against
the spot where he marked her,

23:00.340 --> 23:02.138
he'll haunt you.

23:03.480 --> 23:06.142
So, no, maybe
I'm not like you,

23:06.180 --> 23:10.378
except if Nora was mine,
I couldn't live with that.

23:12.950 --> 23:14.952
(Crickets chirping)

23:24.100 --> 23:25.659
- Hey. Josh, right?

23:25.700 --> 23:26.929
What are you--

23:29.070 --> 23:30.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:30.370 --> 23:33.408
Hey! Nora used to bend
a little more blue-collar.

23:33.440 --> 23:36.671
Must be working her way up
the only way she knows how.

23:36.710 --> 23:38.940
- Say something
else about her.

23:38.980 --> 23:40.277
I'm begging you.

23:45.950 --> 23:47.349
(Will grunting)

23:54.400 --> 23:56.050
- Stop, please!

23:56.100 --> 23:57.397
No, no, no.
I'm sorry!

23:57.430 --> 23:59.421
I just wanted to talk to her.

23:59.470 --> 24:02.440
- Josh! Oh my God!

24:02.470 --> 24:04.438
Oh my God!

24:04.470 --> 24:05.562
Are you OK?

24:05.610 --> 24:08.739
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.032
<i>Get out of here!</i>

24:11.580 --> 24:12.570
God!

24:13.310 --> 24:15.312
Are you OK?

24:15.350 --> 24:16.647
OK...

24:29.960 --> 24:31.962
(Knocking on door)

24:38.810 --> 24:41.177
- No, not again.
Absolutely not!

24:41.210 --> 24:43.747
- You... Do you know me?

24:43.780 --> 24:44.542
(Scoffs)

24:45.410 --> 24:46.946
- Did you have a
pleasant family visit?

24:46.980 --> 24:49.039
Or did you manage
to single-handedly

24:49.080 --> 24:51.617
ruin a woman's life
as predicted?

24:51.650 --> 24:53.209
- I've been here before.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.053
- Miss, can we help you?

24:55.090 --> 24:57.013
- Oh, no, no, see,
Sally here got stuck

24:57.060 --> 24:59.279
in her little
fleshy pleasure sack,

24:59.330 --> 25:01.822
and now she wants us
to clean up her mess.

25:03.630 --> 25:05.166
- Oh crap!

25:06.100 --> 25:07.124
- This house...

25:08.200 --> 25:10.294
I see it in my dreams.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.906
I know something's
coming for me.

25:17.980 --> 25:19.675
Something dark.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.014
And it all started here.

25:31.290 --> 25:32.883
- You know what?

25:32.930 --> 25:33.897
It's entirely
possible that you

25:33.930 --> 25:37.252
got our address inverted,
3836 instead of 3638.

25:37.300 --> 25:40.326
Because it happens all the time.
We order a ton of pizza.

25:40.370 --> 25:42.759
- I need your help!
- Best of luck to you!

25:47.010 --> 25:48.876
- I did that, didn't I?

25:48.910 --> 25:49.934
- Leave it alone.

25:49.980 --> 25:51.800
- She knows the house!

25:51.850 --> 25:53.147
She knows about the--

25:54.880 --> 25:55.972
It's like Janet
was in my head.

25:56.020 --> 25:59.046
I gave her back her body
and I left a piece of my spirit.

25:59.090 --> 26:02.082
I have to help her. I have
to tell her what happened.

26:02.120 --> 26:05.988
- You gotta stay away from her!
- Go and make it right.

26:06.030 --> 26:08.021
- Excuse me?

26:08.060 --> 26:10.028
What happened to:
"Be careful, Sally,

26:10.060 --> 26:11.619
"possession is addictive"?

26:11.670 --> 26:14.059
No, we can't just
do whatever we want

26:14.100 --> 26:15.261
because it
feels good, OK?

26:15.300 --> 26:17.906
- I won't possess her!
I'm gonna talk to her.

26:17.940 --> 26:19.066
- Well I fail to see
how that can happen

26:19.110 --> 26:21.078
unless your powers
have suddenly progressed

26:21.110 --> 26:23.329
beyond pushing paperclips
across the kitchen table--

26:23.380 --> 26:24.745
- Josh!
- What?

26:24.780 --> 26:27.249
- It's not up to you
to tell her when to stop.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.298
- Will's gonna be fine.
The doctor released him.

26:52.310 --> 26:55.075
That's a good thing, Josh!

26:55.110 --> 26:57.909
He's also refusing
to press charges.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.078
So you've managed
to avoid jail time,

27:00.110 --> 27:02.909
in spite of your
best efforts.

27:02.950 --> 27:05.044
I'm not going down this
road with a guy again.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.910
- Do you still have
feelings for him?

27:06.950 --> 27:09.089
- Feelings?

27:11.990 --> 27:13.549
When Will hurt me,

27:14.400 --> 27:17.665
after I checked out
of the hospital,

27:17.700 --> 27:19.099
I never went back.

27:19.830 --> 27:23.039
I left my home,
my friends,

27:23.070 --> 27:24.868
everything I owned.

27:24.910 --> 27:28.574
There was nothing worth having
to see his face ever again.

27:33.180 --> 27:35.672
No matter what he says...

27:37.080 --> 27:40.289
no matter how much he
thinks he's changed...

27:45.060 --> 27:49.019
I'll never forget what it
felt like to be that helpless.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.767
Josh...

27:51.770 --> 27:55.092
Wolf or no wolf,
that guy,

27:55.140 --> 27:57.336
the one who has
a few too many

27:57.370 --> 27:59.304
and flattens a bar
full of people

27:59.340 --> 28:01.672
because somebody
makes eyes at his lady,

28:01.710 --> 28:03.849
that's not who you are.

28:06.010 --> 28:07.717
And I love you.

28:09.780 --> 28:11.714
So it's not who you
have to be either.

28:20.030 --> 28:22.021
I have to go
back inside.

28:22.900 --> 28:25.096
But I'll see you
at the storage space?

28:25.130 --> 28:26.222
- Yeah.

28:26.270 --> 28:27.738
- OK.

28:31.110 --> 28:31.929
- Hey.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.269
I love you too.

28:46.250 --> 28:48.082
- She's gone.

28:48.120 --> 28:51.055
If that twit mobster figured out
where the orphans are hiding,

28:51.090 --> 28:52.080
I know you can too.

28:52.130 --> 28:53.996
- You can't let her
do this to you.

28:54.030 --> 28:56.727
- Do you even remember what
it's like to have a mother?

28:56.760 --> 28:59.263
Then don't tell me
how to deal with mine.

28:59.300 --> 29:03.965
Culling those vampires and
restoring order is our duty.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.933
This town has potential.

29:05.970 --> 29:09.031
I won't let it be ruined by
Bishop's delusional urchins,

29:09.080 --> 29:12.801
regardless of Mother
and her eternal checklist.

29:12.850 --> 29:15.012
It's what I wanted
from the beginning.

29:15.050 --> 29:17.883
Refuse me again
and this is over,

29:17.920 --> 29:19.649
all of it.

29:19.690 --> 29:21.909
Do you not want
to be free?

29:21.960 --> 29:24.930
- You know it's messier
than that now.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.121
- I do.

29:28.060 --> 29:31.098
She'll send me to
ground again, Aidan.

29:32.070 --> 29:34.095
She will.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.165
Maybe never dig me up.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.262
Help me.

29:43.710 --> 29:45.200
- I...

29:45.250 --> 29:47.708
I know where one
of their nests is.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.539
I knew all along.

29:58.690 --> 30:00.055
- There he is.

30:40.070 --> 30:43.165
- All the humans thinking
we're just like them.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.608
- And all the vampires

30:46.640 --> 30:48.904
wishing they were
just like us.

30:48.940 --> 30:52.308
- You'd be wise to make
this a night to remember.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.217
It will be your
last in Boston.

30:55.250 --> 30:57.742
- Mother, why?

30:58.750 --> 31:01.253
- I've had my fill
of the city.

31:01.290 --> 31:05.579
And you've gained more
than enough experience here.

31:12.230 --> 31:14.597
- Then I'll stay behind.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.937
It's time I was
out on my own.

31:17.970 --> 31:20.007
(Laughing)

31:21.380 --> 31:24.975
- I often wonder if it
will ever be time, child.

31:25.010 --> 31:26.648
But no worry.

31:26.680 --> 31:30.173
There will be other towns,
other Henrys.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.787
And someday, maybe one of them
will even be appropriate.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.624
- Henry, we have to leave--

31:50.070 --> 31:51.105
- Out.

31:52.270 --> 31:53.669
- Who is she?

31:53.710 --> 31:55.678
- No one, darling.

31:55.710 --> 31:57.599
Just something
that caught my eye.

31:57.640 --> 32:01.144
I was planning to feed.
I was hoping you'd join me.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.717
- No, I don't
believe you.

32:05.190 --> 32:06.919
How many women?

32:08.090 --> 32:12.630
- You're being ridiculous.
Aidan, please.

32:12.660 --> 32:15.300
Tell Suren she's
the only one I want.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.096
Aidan, tell her she's
acting like a child.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.007
Aidan, wait.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.816
- I warned you.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.858
- To protect me?

32:43.890 --> 32:44.880
(Laughs)

32:44.930 --> 32:47.683
Please, you've been dizzy
on her for months.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.985
- You never come
back here again.

33:16.790 --> 33:18.827
(Screams)

33:18.860 --> 33:20.328
(Screaming)

33:26.300 --> 33:28.268
(Women screaming)

33:37.010 --> 33:39.001
Leave, Henry!

33:49.120 --> 33:51.157
- You've exposed us all.

33:54.230 --> 33:55.891
Leaving us no choice.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.039
Strike up the band.

34:04.070 --> 34:05.868
Lock the doors.

34:07.140 --> 34:09.005
(Women screaming)

34:15.080 --> 34:16.639
- (Suren): No!

34:16.679 --> 34:19.614
- (Mother): Your weakness
has just banished us

34:19.650 --> 34:21.311
back to the shadows.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.851
- (Suren crying):
Let me go!

34:23.889 --> 34:26.052
No! Let me go!

34:26.090 --> 34:28.149
- (Mother):
And you shall be punished.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.726
- I will never
forgive you for this!

34:30.760 --> 34:32.922
- Perhaps a century to
consider your failings

34:32.969 --> 34:34.165
will change your mind.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.190
- NO!

34:35.239 --> 34:39.130
Mother, please don't!
Please don't ground me!

34:39.170 --> 34:42.833
No! Mother!

34:51.150 --> 34:54.882
- Janet... I'm so sorry.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.696
I wish that
you could hear me

35:01.730 --> 35:03.596
so that you'd know
this is all my fault.

35:03.630 --> 35:04.722
That you're not...

35:09.400 --> 35:10.799
crazy.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.865
(Screaming)

35:20.880 --> 35:22.575
- Reaper...

35:26.790 --> 35:29.088
(Crickets chirping)

35:30.620 --> 35:32.327
(Siren)

35:32.360 --> 35:33.987
- Nora...

35:36.330 --> 35:38.799
- Shouldn't you be
picking off Bambi

35:38.830 --> 35:41.060
in some faraway
enchanted forest?

35:41.100 --> 35:43.569
- I've been thinking about
you today. Just wait.

35:43.600 --> 35:47.036
- The moon's almost up.
Make it fast.

35:48.110 --> 35:51.740
- Connor and I,
our parents,

35:51.780 --> 35:56.672
they taught us all about what
it means to be who we are...

35:56.720 --> 35:59.815
to be grateful
for our strength.

35:59.850 --> 36:02.911
I was raised with the
wisdom of generations.

36:02.960 --> 36:07.625
And it devastates me to think
that any wolf, that you...

36:07.660 --> 36:10.027
could be robbed of
that kind of acceptance.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.731
I know what's happening
to you, Nora.

36:14.770 --> 36:18.035
I can see the questions
all over your face.

36:18.070 --> 36:20.505
And I think I
can answer them.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.243
(Leaves rustling)

36:37.020 --> 36:40.081
- It started out
as a curiosity.

36:40.130 --> 36:42.326
I wondered what he
looked like now.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.898
Then I drove out
to the house, parked.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.337
But a couple of
nights later, I...

36:52.370 --> 36:54.634
I got out.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.604
I went to the window
and I just watched him.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.608
(Leaves rustling)

37:08.360 --> 37:10.180
- Hello!

37:10.220 --> 37:12.154
Is anyone here?

37:12.190 --> 37:14.659
- Now it happens
almost every night.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.850
I watch him.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.638
And it takes
everything I have

37:21.670 --> 37:23.661
to stay outside that window.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.735
(Thud)

37:28.210 --> 37:29.575
(Clank)

37:29.610 --> 37:31.647
And I...

37:34.150 --> 37:36.039
I fantasize.

37:38.290 --> 37:42.818
Whatever this thing is,
this urge,

37:42.860 --> 37:45.682
I've never felt
anything so strong.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.995
It's inside of me.

37:50.330 --> 37:54.096
And I--I know
that it's my wolf,

37:54.130 --> 37:55.598
(Gasps)

37:58.100 --> 38:01.070
- She's clawing
at the surface.

38:01.110 --> 38:04.307
But you keep
pushing her down.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.842
- Are she and I the same?

38:06.880 --> 38:08.541
Abused?

38:10.350 --> 38:11.909
I need to know

38:11.950 --> 38:15.215
because I have to
understand what she wants.

38:15.260 --> 38:18.218
I have to understand
why I've been...

38:18.260 --> 38:22.800
I've been counting the days
until a full moon...

38:22.830 --> 38:24.594
until tonight.

38:24.630 --> 38:26.769
(Wolf growling, Will gasps)

38:26.800 --> 38:28.734
- Oh my God!

38:34.070 --> 38:35.401
- She knows.

38:41.250 --> 38:43.617
She just wants
to run free.

38:45.620 --> 38:48.555
How else will the two
of you ever become one?

38:52.290 --> 38:53.689
- Oh my God!

38:54.960 --> 38:56.689
(Snarling)

39:00.300 --> 39:02.132
(Roaring)

39:02.170 --> 39:03.797
No!

39:05.370 --> 39:07.532
(Screaming)

39:15.950 --> 39:18.647
- (Aidan): This funeral home
was the only hope

39:18.690 --> 39:20.579
many of them knew
after Bishop turned them.

39:30.930 --> 39:32.295
They were here.

39:39.070 --> 39:40.663
Recently.

39:45.380 --> 39:47.508
- I'll check
the other rooms.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.129
- They got word
you were coming.

40:10.740 --> 40:12.504
Can you blame them?

40:12.540 --> 40:15.669
Running in fear of
the great warrior.

40:15.710 --> 40:17.371
Hello, Aidan.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.109
- Henry?

40:31.160 --> 40:33.424
It's been 80 years.

40:33.460 --> 40:36.623
You've been living
with the orphans?

40:36.660 --> 40:38.560
- I am an orphan.

40:38.600 --> 40:41.729
A lifetime older,
but exiled all the same.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.104
- You survived!

40:50.140 --> 40:52.347
- (Suren): Aidan...

40:53.410 --> 40:54.548
- She can't see you.

40:54.580 --> 40:56.412
- Aidan?

40:58.080 --> 41:00.344
Nothing.

41:02.790 --> 41:05.430
Aidan, what is it?

41:05.460 --> 41:08.828
- You will never
come back here again.

41:08.860 --> 41:12.490
- Mother, please don't!
Please don't ground me!

41:12.530 --> 41:14.532
No! Mother!

41:14.570 --> 41:15.969
- Nothing.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.805
We'll just have
to keep looking.

41:19.840 --> 41:24.801
** Don't cry out for God

41:26.150 --> 41:30.815
* Just breathe in and out

41:32.590 --> 41:36.117
* We are but lambs
to the slaughter now...

41:36.160 --> 41:38.925
- Nora...

41:38.960 --> 41:43.898
<i>* I have no fear
of death itself...</i>

41:43.930 --> 41:46.399
(Birds chirping)

41:46.430 --> 41:50.833
* My soul has flown

41:51.970 --> 41:56.578
* And I am what is left

41:57.780 --> 42:02.570
<i>* I am skin and bones</i>

42:03.580 --> 42:08.416
<i>* I am skin and bones</i>

42:08.450 --> 42:13.479
<i>* I am skin and bones</i>

42:14.530 --> 42:18.626
<i>* I am skin and bones</i>

42:29.110 --> 42:33.809
<i>(Repeats):
* I am skin and bones... *</i>
