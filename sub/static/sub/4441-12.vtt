WEBVTT

00:15.637 --> 00:17.539
Hey.
Hey!

00:17.606 --> 00:19.405
Hey!

00:22.378 --> 00:23.512
What's up now, water?

00:23.581 --> 00:25.716
Get some, bitch!

00:27.719 --> 00:28.652
Wilfred...

00:28.719 --> 00:31.087
Hey, Ryyy-Seroni...

00:31.155 --> 00:33.957
The-San-Francisco-Treat-
Now-In-The-New...

00:34.025 --> 00:38.431
Chicken...
What's up, neighbor?

00:38.551 --> 00:39.967
Is Wilfred bothering you?

00:40.035 --> 00:42.636
Drew was away for his
bachelor party this weekend,

00:42.704 --> 00:44.804
so Wilfy has all this
pent-up energy.

00:44.934 --> 00:47.235
Oh. Right.
The hunting trip.

00:47.303 --> 00:49.104
Yeah.
Sorry I couldn't make it,

00:49.171 --> 00:50.905
but I had to baby-sit
my new nephew.

00:50.973 --> 00:52.674
Bullshit!
You spent the last 48 hours

00:52.741 --> 00:54.709
on the couch, in your undies,
playing with your doodle.

00:54.776 --> 00:55.710
Aah!

00:57.713 --> 01:00.048
Wilfred loves the hose.
Oh, that reminds me...

01:00.116 --> 01:01.850
we haven't gotten your
RSVP yet, for the wedding.

01:01.918 --> 01:03.218
That's strange.

01:03.286 --> 01:04.253
I mailed that weeks ago.

01:04.319 --> 01:05.754
Uh, no, you didn't.

01:05.822 --> 01:07.923
You remember... you used it
to squash that spider.

01:07.991 --> 01:09.591
You know, that
little baby... agh!

01:13.030 --> 01:14.497
No worries.

01:14.565 --> 01:16.032
I assumed you were coming.

01:16.100 --> 01:17.634
The Bay Club needs a head count,

01:17.702 --> 01:20.037
so I just needed to
know if you'd be alone.

01:20.105 --> 01:21.672
I mean... if you
were bringing someone.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.609
I mean... if... I knew
you and Amanda had brok...

01:24.677 --> 01:27.478
You know what? I'm just gonna
put you down as a "plus-one."

01:27.546 --> 01:28.980
You are coming, right?

01:29.048 --> 01:30.916
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:30.984 --> 01:32.652
Yay!

01:32.719 --> 01:34.120
Oh, and guess who's gonna
be our ring bearer?

01:34.188 --> 01:36.222
Wilfred?
Yeah!

01:36.290 --> 01:38.091
I wouldn't be wedding
without our little sweetheart.

01:38.158 --> 01:40.126
Which walk do you like
better for down the aisle:

01:40.194 --> 01:41.027
This one?

01:44.665 --> 01:45.531
Or this one?

01:52.006 --> 01:53.140
The second one, right?

01:53.208 --> 01:54.775
I don't really care.

01:54.843 --> 01:57.377
Ryan, I've been on a
lot of walks in my life,

01:57.445 --> 01:59.880
but this is the most
important, and the shortest.

01:59.948 --> 02:01.181
What's your problem?

02:01.249 --> 02:02.783
Have you seen the
way they are together?

02:02.851 --> 02:04.585
So happy and perfect?

02:04.653 --> 02:05.586
It's ridiculous.

02:05.653 --> 02:06.753
You're jealous.

02:06.821 --> 02:08.255
I'm not.
You are.

02:08.323 --> 02:10.024
You want Jenna to be
your sweet, sweet baby,

02:10.092 --> 02:11.592
but she loves Drew.

02:11.660 --> 02:12.693
I'm not jealous, I'm just...

02:12.761 --> 02:15.630
Sweet, sweet baby?
Really?

02:15.697 --> 02:17.198
I like it.

02:17.266 --> 02:19.734
Every time I see them smiling

02:19.802 --> 02:22.137
and talking about their
stupid fairy-tale wedding

02:22.204 --> 02:23.505
at the Bay Club...

02:23.572 --> 02:25.573
it just reminds me
of everything I lost.

02:25.641 --> 02:27.076
Amanda again?

02:27.143 --> 02:27.977
I though we were over her.

02:28.044 --> 02:28.978
Well, I'm not.

02:29.046 --> 02:30.513
She's not dead.

02:30.580 --> 02:31.848
Pick up the phone and call her.

02:31.915 --> 02:33.282
I can't.

02:33.350 --> 02:35.385
I'm... well,
you know what I am.

02:35.453 --> 02:37.621
I-I can't bring her
into... this.

02:37.688 --> 02:39.756
Well, then just admit
you're too much of a pussy

02:39.824 --> 02:41.458
to let Amanda see the real you

02:41.526 --> 02:43.494
and stop blaming Drew and
Jenna for your unhappiness.

02:43.562 --> 02:46.898
Being happy is just like
being gay... it's a choice.

02:46.965 --> 02:49.667
That's why they mean the same thing.

02:50.736 --> 02:51.669
Jesus!

02:51.737 --> 02:52.837
Look at this piece of shit.

02:52.905 --> 02:54.773
So full of anger and resentment

02:54.841 --> 02:58.010
just because I'm exceptionally
handsome and living free.

02:58.077 --> 02:59.711
His heart is so full of bitterness

02:59.779 --> 03:01.213
that there's no room
for anything else.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.848
You don't want to be like him, Ryan.

03:02.915 --> 03:05.217
He's a bad, bad dog.

03:05.284 --> 03:06.752
Yeah, I'm talking about you.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.320
What's the matter, dude?
You've never seen

03:08.387 --> 03:09.821
lipstick this big?
You keep yapping

03:09.889 --> 03:11.991
and I'll smear it all over
your lips... whoo-hoo!

03:13.627 --> 03:15.762
Uh, yeah...
we-we should probably go.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.601
Hey, Tucker.
Hey, Loki.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.470
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, George.

03:23.538 --> 03:25.005
Jellybeans.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.506
Come on, Wilfred.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.842
Hey, you guys heard the big news?

03:28.910 --> 03:31.111
I'm gonna be ring bearer
at Jenna's wedding.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.012
I know!
It's gonna be awesome.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.814
I mean, her fiancé's kind of a jerk,

03:34.882 --> 03:37.050
but at least he lets me
watch him lay the pipe.

03:37.118 --> 03:38.351
Hey, Ryan!

03:39.653 --> 03:40.686
Who just shat?

03:40.754 --> 03:42.421
Charlie...

03:43.690 --> 03:45.191
So, what else has been happening?

03:45.259 --> 03:46.826
Something wrong?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.861
Jenna wants us to write
our own wedding vows,

03:48.929 --> 03:51.530
and I'm having trouble
getting started.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.866
I'll let you get to it.
Actually...

03:53.934 --> 03:56.836
I was kind of hoping
you could help me out.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.372
I'm-I'm not much of a writer.
Hey...

03:59.440 --> 04:01.608
I don't need help
with the writing, just...

04:01.676 --> 04:04.944
the inspiration, you know?

04:05.012 --> 04:07.480
You got any "doobage," bro?

04:09.000 --> 04:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:21.327 --> 04:23.528
Oh, man...

04:23.596 --> 04:26.097
I can't even remember
the last time I got high.

04:26.165 --> 04:28.600
Yeah, we'd all love to smoke out,

04:28.668 --> 04:30.436
we really do have work to do, so...

04:30.504 --> 04:33.405
The least we can do is to
make sure his moronic vows

04:33.473 --> 04:34.807
don't ruin her wedding.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.575
Okay, here's what I'm thinking:

04:36.643 --> 04:38.277
Drew comes out, right?

04:38.345 --> 04:41.514
Before he even says a word,
he vanishes.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.649
Then everyone's, like,
"Aw, shit!"

04:43.717 --> 04:45.986
That was just a hologram of Drew.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.522
Then Drew rides in on a panda

04:48.589 --> 04:50.557
and Eddie Van Halen, he's just
like...

04:50.625 --> 04:53.160
Actually, wait, what is
the budget for these vows?

04:53.228 --> 04:54.861
Did you ever wonder
what it would be like

04:54.928 --> 04:56.096
if Wilfred could talk?

04:57.532 --> 05:00.501
I mean, look at him...

05:00.568 --> 05:02.470
it's like he's trying to
tell us something right now.

05:04.473 --> 05:06.241
Hey, what are you trying to say, boy?

05:06.308 --> 05:08.710
Okay, what I'm saying is
we need to start work

05:08.777 --> 05:10.044
on these vows.

05:11.613 --> 05:13.147
Okay, uh, thank you.

05:13.215 --> 05:15.149
That was tasty.

05:15.217 --> 05:16.350
But about these vows, we...

05:17.786 --> 05:18.753
Look, we really need to focus,

05:18.821 --> 05:19.654
if we're gonna...

05:21.290 --> 05:22.990
Okay, you know what?

05:23.058 --> 05:24.692
If you need me, I'm going
to be in the other room.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.095
Working.

05:29.030 --> 05:30.030
Oh, hey, don't tell Jenna

05:30.098 --> 05:32.299
that I gave Wilfred junk food.

05:32.367 --> 05:33.500
She'd kill me.

05:33.568 --> 05:35.169
I doubt that.

05:35.237 --> 05:37.171
You two seem to have a
pretty happy relationship.

05:37.238 --> 05:39.106
We do.

05:39.174 --> 05:41.776
Not that we haven't had our problems.

05:41.843 --> 05:44.479
What do you mean?

05:44.547 --> 05:46.681
I don't really like to talk about it.

05:46.749 --> 05:48.583
Ah, that's cool.

05:48.651 --> 05:50.652
I understand.

05:53.522 --> 05:55.490
What were we talking about?

05:55.558 --> 05:59.261
Uh, something about how
you and Jenna had a falling out,

05:59.329 --> 06:01.096
or something...

06:01.164 --> 06:02.164
Listen, you're a good friend.

06:02.231 --> 06:03.765
I can trust you.

06:06.803 --> 06:10.005
The thing is...

06:10.072 --> 06:11.907
Jenna cheated on me.

06:11.974 --> 06:13.274
What?!

06:13.342 --> 06:16.077
Yeah... yeah...
we had a big fight and...

06:16.145 --> 06:19.180
we didn't talk for, like, a week,

06:19.248 --> 06:21.215
and it just happened.

06:21.283 --> 06:23.017
Jesus!

06:23.085 --> 06:25.185
No wonder you're having
trouble writing the vows.

06:25.253 --> 06:27.788
Yeah... no!

06:27.855 --> 06:29.857
That was a long time ago, and I...

06:29.924 --> 06:33.193
completely forgave her.

06:33.261 --> 06:36.430
The reason that I'm having trouble

06:36.498 --> 06:40.934
is because she's so amazing...

06:41.002 --> 06:44.605
that I can't find
the words to describe

06:44.673 --> 06:47.241
how much I love her...

06:47.309 --> 06:50.311
for loving me...

06:50.379 --> 06:52.580
despite my faults.

06:52.648 --> 06:54.782
That's great.

06:54.850 --> 06:59.220
I mean, dude...
it took me a month

06:59.287 --> 07:02.222
to come up with
the inscription on the ring.

07:02.290 --> 07:04.591
It's only three words.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.896
That's... really beautiful.

07:09.964 --> 07:13.300
Oh, I just had a great idea.

07:13.368 --> 07:15.469
You should walk
Wilfred down the aisle.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.171
Oh... I...

07:21.709 --> 07:22.742
Sure.

07:22.810 --> 07:26.079
Nice. Nice.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.415
Jenna's gonna be stoked.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.184
No, no, you hold onto it.

07:31.252 --> 07:34.187
You're a ring bearer now, bro.

07:37.425 --> 07:38.892
This is bullshit!

07:38.960 --> 07:40.293
I don't even want to go
to this wedding.

07:40.361 --> 07:42.028
Now I'm the co-ring bearer?

07:42.096 --> 07:44.664
Yeah... we need
to talk about your title.

07:44.732 --> 07:47.033
Co-Ring Bearer makes it
sound like we're equals.

07:47.101 --> 07:48.902
"Above all, love."

07:48.969 --> 07:50.303
That's what it says.

07:50.371 --> 07:51.871
Screw them.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.172
I mean, basically, all you have to do

07:53.240 --> 07:55.041
is follow me down
the aisle and make sure

07:55.108 --> 07:56.275
my tail doesn't touch the ground.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.944
I could live with Tail Holder,

07:58.012 --> 08:02.415
and maybe Associate
Ring Bearer, but...

08:02.482 --> 08:03.983
The hell with that.
I'm not going.

08:04.051 --> 08:07.854
Fine! You can be
Co-Ring Bearer, you big baby!

08:07.921 --> 08:09.389
This isn't fair, Wilfred.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.558
They have cheating, anger issues,

08:11.625 --> 08:13.393
but they're still madly
in love with each other.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.295
Meanwhile, I can't even
have a relationship?

08:15.362 --> 08:17.297
Wait a minute...

08:17.365 --> 08:19.999
Drew cheated on Jenna?

08:20.067 --> 08:21.301
She cheated on Drew.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.305
You shut your lying face vagina.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.939
Jenna wouldn't cheat on anyone.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.674
Whatever.
I'm still not going.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.842
Well, you have to go.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.844
You have the ring.

08:31.912 --> 08:32.730
Good point.

08:32.850 --> 08:34.913
You're the ring bearer, you take it.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.150
No...

08:48.720 --> 08:49.620
No...

08:51.323 --> 08:52.290
Yeah.

08:54.126 --> 08:56.360
No.
Will you hurry up?

08:56.428 --> 08:58.029
Well, I can't do it
when you're watching.

08:58.096 --> 08:59.797
It's just so typical.

08:59.865 --> 09:01.798
You knew I'd need that ring
to back out of the wedding,

09:01.799 --> 09:02.599
so you swallowed it.

09:02.634 --> 09:04.435
How's this my fault?
You threw it.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.103
I threw it for you to catch.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.405
And catch it, I did.

09:07.472 --> 09:08.539
And quite skillfully, I might add.

09:08.607 --> 09:09.907
You throw like a girl.

09:15.413 --> 09:17.614
If you ask me, I think
you wanted this to happen.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.549
You won't be satisfied until
you've ruined Jenna's wedding.

09:19.617 --> 09:20.850
I don't want to ruin it.

09:20.918 --> 09:22.285
I just don't want to be there.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.487
Well, if that's true,

09:23.554 --> 09:25.321
why are you trying to
turn me against Jenna

09:25.322 --> 09:26.489
by calling her a cheater?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.424
Because, according to Drew,
she is a cheater.

09:28.492 --> 09:29.959
Oh, come on, Ryan.

09:30.026 --> 09:31.427
If Jenna's capable
of cheating on Drew,

09:31.495 --> 09:33.062
then she's capable of cheating on me,

09:33.130 --> 09:34.697
and we both know Jenna would
never pet another dog.

09:34.765 --> 09:36.298
Are you telling me
you've never smelled

09:36.366 --> 09:37.533
another dog on Jenna's hands?

09:37.601 --> 09:39.602
Yeah, that... but
that's just from her

09:39.670 --> 09:41.871
pushing other dogs away.

09:41.938 --> 09:43.606
Hey, guys!

09:43.673 --> 09:45.007
Hey, Wilfred!

09:45.075 --> 09:46.809
Hey, babe.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.744
What, have you been at
the grocery store all this time?

09:48.812 --> 09:50.545
Hey, you...

09:50.613 --> 09:51.981
Aw...

09:52.048 --> 09:53.282
Looks like someone missed you.

09:53.350 --> 09:54.483
Either that, or he smells Rocky

09:54.484 --> 09:55.317
from the pet store.

09:55.352 --> 09:57.220
The pet store?!

09:57.287 --> 09:59.055
You didn't mention anything
about going to the pet store.

09:59.123 --> 10:01.457
Who the hell's Rocky?

10:01.525 --> 10:04.060
Hey, you got that ring somewhere safe?

10:04.128 --> 10:05.462
Oh, yeah... yeah...

10:09.333 --> 10:11.935
As soon as they're gone,
you need to shit.

10:12.003 --> 10:13.938
How can I even think
about shitting right now?

10:14.005 --> 10:15.806
I just found out Jenna's
been down at the pet store,

10:15.874 --> 10:17.341
sucking another dog's dick.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.344
No, she didn't.
She just petted him.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.112
It's the same thing, Ryan.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.982
I mean, what's this
Rocky got that I haven't?

10:25.885 --> 10:26.985
Papers...

10:27.053 --> 10:28.487
Oh, God!

10:29.890 --> 10:31.657
How can I compete with a purebred?

10:31.725 --> 10:32.925
Wilfred, relax.

10:32.993 --> 10:34.527
How do you even know Rocky's a dog?

10:34.595 --> 10:38.464
Maybe he's just a guy
working at the pet store.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.667
Of course.
That makes perfect sense.

10:41.735 --> 10:43.903
He probably just gave her
a friendly hug

10:43.970 --> 10:45.638
to thank her for making a purchase.

10:45.706 --> 10:47.506
I know Jenna would never cheat on me.

10:49.042 --> 10:51.343
Oh, yeah, you like
that, don't you? Oh!

11:01.888 --> 11:03.354
Hey, buddy.

11:03.422 --> 11:04.856
You want to go outside to play?

11:04.923 --> 11:06.124
Maybe take that shit?

11:08.794 --> 11:12.463
Ryan, I just watched Jenna
take it in the hands

11:12.531 --> 11:13.998
from every guy in the neighborhood.

11:14.066 --> 11:16.334
I ain't going anywhere.

11:16.402 --> 11:17.669
She pet a few dogs.

11:17.736 --> 11:19.170
So what?

11:19.238 --> 11:20.872
I've seen you get petted
by hundreds of people.

11:20.940 --> 11:22.874
It's different, I'm a dude!

11:22.942 --> 11:24.742
Plus, did you see those guys?

11:24.810 --> 11:26.711
I mean, Tucker
I can kind of understand.

11:26.779 --> 11:28.180
He featured on a clever greeting card.

11:28.247 --> 11:29.448
But Jellybeans?

11:29.515 --> 11:32.984
His mother is his sister.

11:34.119 --> 11:35.353
I'm gonna be sick.

11:36.655 --> 11:38.956
Ryan...

11:40.659 --> 11:42.893
Ears, Ryan, ears!

11:44.562 --> 11:45.562
God.

11:55.273 --> 11:56.773
Right. No ring.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.209
That would be too easy.

12:01.780 --> 12:03.380
I'm done messing around, Wilfred.

12:03.448 --> 12:04.882
Put that down and let's go outside.

12:06.318 --> 12:08.819
I don't feel like going out.

12:08.887 --> 12:10.621
God damn it!
Why won't you just shit for me?

12:10.689 --> 12:12.991
Because I can't! Ow...

12:13.058 --> 12:14.959
Why? Do you have
a bowel obstruction?

12:15.027 --> 12:16.294
No.

12:16.362 --> 12:17.695
I have my pride.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.331
Screw it.

12:20.399 --> 12:22.100
Where are you going?

12:22.168 --> 12:23.668
I'm done playing your games.

12:23.736 --> 12:25.270
If the only way
I'm gonna skip that wedding

12:25.337 --> 12:27.605
is to buy Drew a new ring,
then so be it.

12:27.673 --> 12:30.142
Tell him I'm not going either.

12:30.210 --> 12:31.810
To the wedding or the bathroom.

12:31.878 --> 12:33.512
Ever!

12:34.847 --> 12:37.115
This cannot be good for me.

12:42.856 --> 12:44.523
Hello? Drew?

12:44.591 --> 12:46.559
Oh, hey.

12:46.626 --> 12:48.094
Sorry, I'll-I'll just
come back later.

12:48.161 --> 12:50.362
No, that's okay.
Uh, we were just...

12:50.430 --> 12:52.265
Putting away my camping stuff.

12:52.332 --> 12:54.601
Let me just... um...

12:54.669 --> 12:57.103
get this sleeping bag.

12:57.171 --> 12:58.504
I'll get the rest later.

12:58.572 --> 13:00.473
What's up, bro?

13:00.541 --> 13:03.076
Actually, uh, I-I'm glad
you're both here.

13:03.144 --> 13:04.911
Just wanted to talk
to you about your wedding.

13:04.979 --> 13:06.546
Oh, good.

13:06.614 --> 13:08.214
Um, now that you're
in the wedding party...

13:08.215 --> 13:09.482
which is so amazing, by the way...

13:09.517 --> 13:11.085
we need to go
over what you'll be wearing.

13:11.152 --> 13:13.287
Wait here, I-I want to
show you something.

13:16.825 --> 13:19.527
Everything okay, buddy?
Yeah.

13:19.595 --> 13:23.198
Hey, while I've got you alone,

13:23.266 --> 13:25.133
I was looking at that ring.

13:25.201 --> 13:26.568
It's really beautiful.

13:26.636 --> 13:28.871
If you don't mind my asking,

13:28.939 --> 13:31.073
how much does something
like that cost?

13:31.140 --> 13:33.475
I don't know.

13:33.543 --> 13:35.277
About $50?

13:35.344 --> 13:37.112
That's it?

13:37.180 --> 13:40.281
Yeah, when my grandfather
bought it back in 1950.

13:40.349 --> 13:44.051
My Nana gave it to me when
she heard I was engaged.

13:44.119 --> 13:45.820
She was hoping to be here in person

13:45.888 --> 13:48.756
to see it on Jenna's finger, but...

13:48.823 --> 13:50.657
I guess God had other plans.

13:50.725 --> 13:52.693
Jenna!

13:52.761 --> 13:54.361
Jenna!

13:54.429 --> 13:56.096
Where is she?

13:56.164 --> 13:58.232
Where's that cheating whore?

13:58.300 --> 13:59.633
Wilfred, calm down!

13:59.701 --> 14:01.702
I should calm down?
You should calm up!

14:01.770 --> 14:03.070
You're about to marry

14:03.138 --> 14:04.304
the neighborhood slut

14:04.372 --> 14:05.773
and you don't even care!

14:05.840 --> 14:07.775
♪ Here comes the bride... ♪

14:09.511 --> 14:11.645
So... what do you think?

14:11.713 --> 14:13.980
I think you've got some balls
wearing white!

14:14.048 --> 14:16.516
I will have my honor!

14:16.584 --> 14:18.117
Wilfred, no!

14:18.986 --> 14:20.620
Oh, my God!

14:20.687 --> 14:22.255
Call 911!

14:22.322 --> 14:23.523
- Just don't move...
- Ow!

14:23.590 --> 14:25.591
Wilfred, you bad dog!
Bad dog!

14:25.659 --> 14:27.510
Bad girl!

14:27.630 --> 14:29.831
Ow...
Just stay calm, just stay calm.

14:43.575 --> 14:46.644
I hate you, happy kids!

14:46.711 --> 14:48.179
Yeah, keep moving, you little...

14:49.071 --> 14:50.915
tiny-balled bastards.

14:50.983 --> 14:53.251
Wilfred.

14:53.319 --> 14:55.453
What are you doing here?

14:55.521 --> 14:57.989
This is my home now.

14:58.057 --> 15:00.325
You heard Jenna.

15:00.392 --> 15:01.626
I'm a bad dog.

15:01.694 --> 15:03.261
Jenna was upset.

15:03.329 --> 15:04.670
Drew was shot in the leg.

15:04.790 --> 15:07.198
Look, if you're missing when she
gets back from the hospital,

15:07.266 --> 15:08.566
she's gonna be worried sick.

15:08.634 --> 15:11.936
It's nothing that a handful
of Jellybeans won't cure.

15:12.004 --> 15:13.672
This is insane.

15:13.739 --> 15:15.707
When did ensuring Jenna
and Drew's happiness

15:15.774 --> 15:17.142
become my full-time job?

15:17.209 --> 15:19.811
I just want to return that ring

15:19.879 --> 15:21.913
and forget about this whole wedding!

15:21.981 --> 15:23.381
She doesn't even deserve
a wedding ring.

15:23.449 --> 15:24.950
Not after how she betrayed me.

15:25.017 --> 15:27.219
So, what, you're just
never gonna shit again?

15:27.286 --> 15:29.020
I've done a lot of good shits
in my life, Ryan.

15:29.088 --> 15:30.989
I'll have my memories.

15:31.057 --> 15:32.924
Holding all that stuff inside
isn't hurting Jenna,

15:32.925 --> 15:33.758
it's hurting you.

15:33.793 --> 15:35.427
You gonna carry around
that pain forever?

15:35.495 --> 15:38.030
What about all the shit
you're holding inside?

15:38.098 --> 15:40.333
You can't hate Drew and Jenna
because they're happy!

15:40.401 --> 15:41.901
This isn't about me, it's about you!

15:41.969 --> 15:43.502
Just let it go...
Just let it go...

15:43.570 --> 15:46.472
and get on with your life!
And get on with your life!

15:49.243 --> 15:50.443
Wilfred, you need to get out of there.

15:50.510 --> 15:53.078
Ryan!
Open the gate for me!!

15:53.146 --> 15:55.047
I'm trying!

15:55.115 --> 15:57.383
I want my mommy!

15:58.985 --> 16:01.120
Oh.

16:01.188 --> 16:03.823
Are you all right?

16:03.890 --> 16:05.224
Yeah...

16:05.292 --> 16:06.859
Wilfred, look!
The ring!

16:06.927 --> 16:09.128
Oh. Huh?
Here.

16:09.196 --> 16:10.462
Here, get out through here.

16:10.530 --> 16:12.264
Come on.

16:15.869 --> 16:17.035
Where is it?

16:18.204 --> 16:20.239
No!

16:20.306 --> 16:21.673
Calm down, I'm just cleaning it.

16:21.741 --> 16:23.976
Ugh.

16:26.746 --> 16:27.913
Wilfred!

16:27.981 --> 16:29.314
Wilfy!

16:29.382 --> 16:31.717
Oh...

16:31.785 --> 16:33.318
Oh, Wilfy, oh...

16:33.386 --> 16:35.253
You must have been so scared!

16:35.321 --> 16:38.857
I am so, so sorry I yelled at
you, my sweet, sweet baby.

16:38.925 --> 16:41.126
Get a good look, boys!
She pet you once,

16:41.194 --> 16:42.561
but who sleeps on her bed every night?

16:42.629 --> 16:43.896
I'm looking at you, Jellybeans.

16:43.964 --> 16:45.865
Thanks a lot, bro.
We owe you one.

16:45.933 --> 16:47.066
No problem.

16:47.134 --> 16:48.534
How's your leg?

16:48.601 --> 16:52.404
I, um, gotta get surgery on Saturday.

16:52.472 --> 16:54.240
But Saturday is...
Yeah.

16:54.308 --> 16:57.210
Which means we're losing the
Bay Club and all our deposits.

16:57.278 --> 16:58.745
Plus, my dress is ruined.

16:58.813 --> 17:00.446
We're just gonna get married

17:00.514 --> 17:02.148
in a civil ceremony at the courthouse.

17:02.216 --> 17:04.017
But what about my walk down the aisle?

17:04.085 --> 17:06.185
I'm so sorry.

17:06.252 --> 17:07.420
Ah, don't be.

17:07.488 --> 17:08.954
I still get to marry

17:09.022 --> 17:11.692
the nicest, prettiest
girl in the world,

17:11.760 --> 17:13.093
and spend my life with her, too.

17:13.161 --> 17:14.428
Aw...

17:14.496 --> 17:16.196
That's just the painkillers talking.

17:17.633 --> 17:21.635
No, it's not, Jenna-ration X.

17:23.804 --> 17:25.305
You're not getting married
at the courthouse.

17:27.141 --> 17:28.575
I'm throwing you a wedding.

17:28.643 --> 17:30.744
We can have it in my backyard.

17:30.812 --> 17:32.880
And Kristen has a beautiful
dress that you can borrow.

17:32.947 --> 17:34.682
Ryan, that's so sweet, but...

17:34.749 --> 17:36.550
I won't take no for an answer.

17:36.618 --> 17:39.420
Nothing would make me happier
than to watch the two of you

17:39.487 --> 17:40.654
walk down that aisle together.

17:45.327 --> 17:46.861
Thank you so much, Ryan!

17:48.630 --> 17:50.965
Oh!

17:51.033 --> 17:52.433
And don't worry, Wilfred.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.734
You can walk down that aisle, too.

17:55.704 --> 17:57.172
Uh, thanks, Ryan.

17:57.239 --> 17:58.640
We should get you inside.

17:58.707 --> 18:00.909
Thank you, Ryan.

18:06.616 --> 18:08.383
Look at them.

18:08.451 --> 18:10.719
So happy together.

18:12.155 --> 18:13.956
I hope I can be lucky enough

18:14.023 --> 18:15.857
to have something like that one day.

18:15.925 --> 18:18.160
Wilfred!

18:19.195 --> 18:21.430
That's up to you, mate.

18:46.701 --> 18:49.069
Ryan, I redid Drew's vows.

18:49.137 --> 18:51.886
Um, do you mind if I just
bounce them off you?

18:52.006 --> 18:55.208
Sure.

18:55.276 --> 18:59.346
"Jenna, you've got a smile,
it seems to me,

18:59.414 --> 19:02.048
"reminds me of childhood memories,

19:02.116 --> 19:03.817
"where everything was as fresh

19:03.884 --> 19:05.418
as the bright blue sky."

19:05.486 --> 19:07.153
You wrote that?

19:07.221 --> 19:09.122
Yeah, I did.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.356
It's beautiful.

19:10.424 --> 19:11.891
Keep going.

19:11.958 --> 19:15.027
"Now and then when I see your face,

19:15.095 --> 19:17.474
"you take me away to
that special place,

19:17.772 --> 19:19.130
and if I stay too long..."

19:19.198 --> 19:22.300
Wait. Wait, those are the lyrics
to "Sweet Child O' Mine."

19:22.368 --> 19:24.135
No, they're not.

19:24.203 --> 19:26.715
This comes from the heart.

19:27.539 --> 19:29.807
"Guitar solo?"

19:32.477 --> 19:34.611
I'll just keep working on 'em.

19:37.015 --> 19:39.216
I guess I'd want it
to be when I'm really old,

19:39.283 --> 19:41.484
surrounded by my family.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.719
I'd close my eyes,

19:44.955 --> 19:46.841
and... drift away.

19:48.759 --> 19:51.362
What about you?

19:51.429 --> 19:55.365
I was seeing it more like
five or six years from now,

19:55.433 --> 19:59.103
after the fall of society,
when robots rule the earth,

19:59.170 --> 20:01.371
and, like, the zoos have fallen apart

20:01.439 --> 20:04.908
so the animals are, like,
viciously hunting people down.

20:04.976 --> 20:07.978
And this leopard finds you
in this mud hole...

20:08.046 --> 20:09.413
Finds <i>me?</i>

20:09.481 --> 20:11.849
Yeah, hiding from the robots

20:11.917 --> 20:13.485
who sodomized your sister.

20:13.552 --> 20:15.753
And the leopard, he just like
bites your head off.

20:15.821 --> 20:17.655
Wait, I thought we were
talking about ways that

20:17.723 --> 20:19.658
<i>we</i> wanted to die.

20:19.725 --> 20:23.376
No, we... we're talking about
ways we want <i>you</i> to die.

20:26.566 --> 20:29.167
I don't want to die.

20:39.512 --> 20:41.147
Is this my T-shirt?

20:41.214 --> 20:42.381
Oh, yeah.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.616
You can have that back now.

20:43.684 --> 20:45.017
Thanks.

20:45.085 --> 20:46.319
Is it dirty?

20:46.387 --> 20:47.821
Did you pull it out of the laundry?

20:47.888 --> 20:50.090
I was lonely this morning,

20:50.157 --> 20:53.594
and I wanted something near me
that smelt like you,

20:53.661 --> 20:55.463
so I took the T-shirt

20:55.530 --> 20:56.731
out of the laundry basket

20:56.798 --> 20:59.300
and I snuggled up with it.

20:59.368 --> 21:00.635
Wow.

21:00.703 --> 21:02.237
That's actually kind of sweet.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.539
And made love on it.
