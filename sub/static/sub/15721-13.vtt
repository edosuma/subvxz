00:09.267 --> 00:10.417
Hello, David.

00:10.679 --> 00:11.800
Hello, Bob.

00:12.108 --> 00:14.809
- What are you doing here?
- Nice to see you too, Nina.

00:15.252 --> 00:16.702
Still pregnant, eh?

00:16.947 --> 00:18.933
- We need to get going.
- Hang on a sec.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.940
You're not the easiest people to find.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.567
You look tired, David.

00:23.166 --> 00:24.486
Bob, let's take a walk.

00:25.031 --> 00:26.863
We really have to get going, David.

00:27.666 --> 00:28.740
- Bob?
- No!

00:30.050 --> 00:31.050
It's okay.

00:32.112 --> 00:33.161
I won't be long.

00:33.413 --> 00:35.161
Human cloning is illegal.

00:35.740 --> 00:38.081
- So is abortion.
- You know what you're doing is wrong.

00:38.201 --> 00:40.084
Both morally and ethically.

00:40.204 --> 00:41.795
I'm coming to terms with it.

00:41.955 --> 00:44.005
You ever read a little book
called Frankenstein?

00:44.165 --> 00:45.215
Nina and I,

00:45.686 --> 00:48.545
we're not giving up on this.
When our boy grows up,

00:48.665 --> 00:50.630
he'll have within him the power
to spreading gifts

00:50.750 --> 00:53.141
- throughout the world...
- You've already got Johnny Appleseed

00:53.261 --> 00:54.933
knocking up the entire planet.

00:55.093 --> 00:57.991
- You're talking about my son.
- At least come back with me, okay?

00:58.111 --> 00:59.229
Come back to the lab.

01:00.525 --> 01:02.025
I have to go, David.

01:04.131 --> 01:06.408
Bob, I am not gonna let you do this.

01:06.528 --> 01:07.818
Yes you are!

01:16.689 --> 01:19.703
I know when I go, it won't be
the normal tick of the clock.

01:19.823 --> 01:22.589
It won't be the obligatory flash
of my life before me.

01:22.709 --> 01:24.713
But the whole spectacle of amino acids,

01:24.983 --> 01:27.483
proteins, DNA codes dancing in my brain.

01:29.159 --> 01:30.859
Were we better off then?

01:31.296 --> 01:33.847
Or was it just that we didn't know
as much as we do now?

01:35.961 --> 01:38.561
So what was it like
when we knew nothing?

01:38.858 --> 01:40.458
When we didn't wonder?

01:40.708 --> 01:42.258
And we didn't engage?

01:44.955 --> 01:46.505
I guess that's death.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.867
And it's been chasing me
for a long time.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.360
Dr. Sandström?

01:56.810 --> 01:58.010
Dr. Sandström.

01:59.149 --> 02:00.489
On November 8th,

02:01.457 --> 02:04.085
2008. Robert Melnikov Junior was born

02:04.606 --> 02:07.630
at the Vistapoint Medical Facility
in Independence,

02:07.790 --> 02:08.740
Missouri.

02:09.366 --> 02:13.192
Attended to by a Dr. Stephen Clements,

02:13.746 --> 02:15.000
now deceased,

02:15.590 --> 02:17.990
and an unknown nurse. Is that correct?

02:20.681 --> 02:21.984
Cynthia Wilson.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.581
That was the name of the nurse.

02:26.807 --> 02:27.859
Thank you, Dr.

02:28.019 --> 02:30.919
And can you tell me
why Independence, Missouri?

02:32.230 --> 02:34.762
I guess
that's where they were at the time.

02:35.818 --> 02:38.870
And it had nothing to do
with the passing of Amendment 2

02:39.030 --> 02:42.953
by the people of Missouri
in November 2006

02:43.286 --> 02:45.636
unwittingly legalizing human cloning?

02:46.667 --> 02:49.457
I suppose this is where you want me
to go on record

02:49.577 --> 02:51.770
and say that Robert is a clone.

02:55.724 --> 02:56.915
For the record

02:57.035 --> 02:59.635
would you say
that he was a healthy baby?

03:01.443 --> 03:03.111
First time I met him,

03:03.231 --> 03:05.313
- he was just getting over the flu.
- I see

03:05.473 --> 03:06.792
and when was that?

03:06.912 --> 03:08.861
During the pandemic of 2010.

03:09.602 --> 03:11.531
And at that time,

03:12.522 --> 03:13.872
did you feel that

03:14.500 --> 03:17.266
the Melnikov clone was a threat?

03:17.386 --> 03:18.586
Human being...

03:19.112 --> 03:21.579
- Robert is a human being.
- I see, I see. And,

03:22.155 --> 03:24.642
when you first met him,
at two years old,

03:24.762 --> 03:27.001
did you still think
that he should be destroyed?

03:28.071 --> 03:31.256
I wouldn't be here defending the lives
of 3.2 million people

03:31.416 --> 03:32.366
if I did.

03:32.711 --> 03:35.260
And in hindsight,
do you regret that decision?

03:35.420 --> 03:36.120
No.

03:36.392 --> 03:39.762
Even though
close to one billion people died

03:40.426 --> 03:43.893
directly because of the Melnikov clone?

03:44.053 --> 03:45.503
Now hang on second.

03:46.517 --> 03:49.370
People died because they got sick.

03:50.303 --> 03:52.403
Their immune systems broke down,

03:52.630 --> 03:54.130
their organs failed,

03:54.488 --> 03:55.488
they died.

03:56.064 --> 03:59.136
Same way they've been doing it
since the first ding dong of time.

03:59.256 --> 04:01.029
But why did they get sick,

04:01.149 --> 04:02.199
Dr. Sandström?

04:02.319 --> 04:06.317
That is what the scientists watching
this inquiery are gonna want to know.

04:06.613 --> 04:10.113
Why did they get sick
and what are we going to do about it?

04:11.265 --> 04:14.549
And that's
what we are going to determine today.

05:54.839 --> 05:57.485
At this point,
I'd like to call Robert Melnikov.

05:57.843 --> 05:58.843
Say again?

06:00.759 --> 06:04.555
Bob died of a cerebral hemorrhage
back in 2024.

06:05.439 --> 06:07.742
Call Robert Melnikov Junior.

06:16.963 --> 06:17.813
Robert.

06:18.463 --> 06:19.716
Hello, David.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.325
I am so sorry about all this.

06:24.892 --> 06:25.742
Me too.

06:41.198 --> 06:43.614
Would you please state your full name?

06:43.866 --> 06:46.060
Robert Crick Melnikov

06:46.902 --> 06:47.660
Junior.

06:48.097 --> 06:50.496
Would you characterize yourself
as an entrepreneur?

06:51.013 --> 06:52.421
I suppose that's fair.

06:52.541 --> 06:55.559
And, for the record
your parents were...?

06:56.816 --> 06:58.316
Dr. Robert Melnikov.

07:00.095 --> 07:02.550
My mother
was Dr. Nina Corba Melnikov.

07:02.871 --> 07:04.552
But that's not really true is it?

07:04.821 --> 07:06.216
What's not true?

07:06.923 --> 07:09.723
You said your mother
was Nina Corba Melnikov.

07:12.141 --> 07:12.951
Yes,

07:13.406 --> 07:15.141
she was.

07:16.164 --> 07:19.942
She gave birth to me
on November 8th, 2008.

07:20.102 --> 07:21.617
But you're a clone.

07:34.365 --> 07:36.459
Thanks for taking
such an interest in our son.

07:36.619 --> 07:38.241
Where do you go from here?

07:38.361 --> 07:40.129
What are your plans for the future?

07:40.289 --> 07:43.289
We just want to raise Robert
to be a good person.

07:50.048 --> 07:53.309
Are you aware of the circumstances
that brought about your conception?

07:53.595 --> 07:56.604
Do you mean do I understand
the science of genetic engineering?

07:56.764 --> 08:00.007
I mean, do you understand
why you were genetically engineered?

08:00.127 --> 08:00.942
Yes.

08:01.965 --> 08:02.965
My mother,

08:03.718 --> 08:07.518
- along with Mr. Olivier Roth...
- Who committed suicide in 2008.

08:08.582 --> 08:11.247
... wanted to ensure
a generation of empathetic human beings.

08:11.367 --> 08:12.753
In 2008,

08:12.873 --> 08:15.030
he implanted your father's stem cells

08:15.150 --> 08:18.132
in 176 rising politicians.

08:19.153 --> 08:20.461
Yes, but that failed.

08:20.621 --> 08:21.516
No shit...

08:21.636 --> 08:25.216
After that, your mother and father
disappeared from the public eye.

08:25.507 --> 08:27.260
My mother was afraid of David.

08:28.810 --> 08:31.013
She knew that he wouldn't give up.

08:31.550 --> 08:34.750
Your parents managed
to stay in hiding for some time,

08:35.070 --> 08:38.270
largely due to the help
of Carlton Riddlemeyer, is that correct?

08:38.909 --> 08:39.856
Yes.

08:44.603 --> 08:47.812
Carlton Riddlemeyer retired
from the position of Under Secretary

08:47.932 --> 08:51.855
for Science and Technology
in 2009 after a failed Senate bid.

08:51.975 --> 08:55.163
What can you tell us
about Carlton Riddlemeyer?

08:56.846 --> 08:58.291
Honestly, not much.

08:58.837 --> 09:00.459
I never really knew him.

09:00.619 --> 09:03.568
Both my mother and Mr. Riddlemeyer

09:03.688 --> 09:05.882
died in the 2010 pandemic.

09:06.226 --> 09:07.820
And your father?

09:08.519 --> 09:10.769
He was fine. He took me to Toronto.

09:11.679 --> 09:15.183
I was home schooled and kept pretty much
out of the spotlight.

09:15.462 --> 09:17.762
My father was very protective of me,

09:18.238 --> 09:20.396
until he passed when I was 17.

09:20.556 --> 09:22.857
And when you were 18, what did you do?

09:28.808 --> 09:31.464
Mr. Riddlemeyer along with Mr. Roth

09:31.970 --> 09:33.726
had established a trust

09:34.240 --> 09:36.822
that I had access to when I was 18.

09:37.046 --> 09:38.210
You founded

09:38.330 --> 09:41.259
the Robert Melnikov Fertility Center

09:41.379 --> 09:42.752
with that money,

09:42.872 --> 09:46.797
which recently the press has referred to
as "ground zero".

09:50.775 --> 09:52.025
That's correct.

09:58.117 --> 10:01.558
18 years ago, the first human clone,

10:01.678 --> 10:03.134
Robert Melnikov Junior,

10:03.254 --> 10:05.615
was born into this world with a gift.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.447
A gift for mankind.

10:07.723 --> 10:09.581
The gift of empathy.

10:10.321 --> 10:13.482
Now, the Robert Melnikov Junior
Fertility Center

10:13.985 --> 10:15.660
can offer an evolutionary breakthrough:

10:16.282 --> 10:18.871
the awakening of your Jacobson's organ.

10:19.032 --> 10:20.051
Simply put,

10:20.940 --> 10:24.883
this gland located here,
at the base of the nasal cavity

10:25.492 --> 10:27.672
can help us understand one another.

10:28.022 --> 10:30.772
Empathy is the gift of knowledge,

10:31.175 --> 10:33.552
understanding and compassion.

10:33.956 --> 10:36.953
That infomercial ran in 178 countries
in 45 languages including Estonian...

10:37.073 --> 10:40.705
Your fertility center
was entirely devoted

10:40.825 --> 10:44.348
to the sales and distribution
of your sperm

10:44.611 --> 10:48.109
to hundreds and thousands of women
throughout the world.

10:51.090 --> 10:53.490
It's well known that my DNA

10:54.096 --> 10:57.235
is, well at least was,
the most desirable.

10:57.355 --> 11:00.204
And you took advantage of that.

11:01.868 --> 11:05.584
I believed I had a product
that people wanted.

11:05.839 --> 11:09.827
You distributed your semen
for financial reward and nothing more.

11:10.661 --> 11:11.655
Well yes...

11:11.969 --> 11:12.675
no.

11:14.084 --> 11:15.610
I mean it was business,

11:16.038 --> 11:18.517
but I wanted to carry out
my parents' desire

11:19.064 --> 11:20.858
to make the world a better place.

11:20.978 --> 11:23.493
Did you run extensive tests
on your sperm?

11:24.174 --> 11:26.217
Enough to know that I had a high count.

11:27.843 --> 11:28.928
On your DNA?

11:33.075 --> 11:35.539
Enough to know
that I was an identical clone

11:35.948 --> 11:37.283
of my father.

11:37.443 --> 11:40.578
And did you check
for retro-virus activation?

11:42.888 --> 11:44.392
You don't understand...

11:44.718 --> 11:46.060
I didn't know at that time...

11:46.180 --> 11:49.420
So you had no idea what you were
spreading out in the world.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.483
I believed
that I was spreading a gift of empathy

11:56.843 --> 11:58.576
to families who wanted children...

11:58.696 --> 12:00.910
And how long did you continue
to sell this "gift"

12:01.030 --> 12:02.886
after it was considered "ground zero"

12:03.006 --> 12:05.478
for the pandemics
that were sweeping the world?

12:05.900 --> 12:07.293
I stopped immediately.

12:07.413 --> 12:08.440
And isn't it true

12:08.683 --> 12:11.942
that a World Science
and Technology Court order

12:12.248 --> 12:14.779
was issued demanding
that you appear here?

12:15.578 --> 12:16.354
Yes.

12:17.351 --> 12:18.366
Mr. Melnikov.

12:21.410 --> 12:24.723
We are talking about
close to a billion people

12:24.843 --> 12:25.856
who died

12:26.559 --> 12:29.543
because of what you released
into this world.

12:29.703 --> 12:32.129
He was two years old
when all of this happened.

12:32.575 --> 12:35.841
You're asking him to answer to questions
he knows nothing about!

12:36.143 --> 12:39.831
I assume that you're referring
to the flu pandemic of 2010.

12:41.077 --> 12:43.849
Well that's the theory
that's on the table, isn't it?

12:46.204 --> 12:48.208
You may step down, Mr. Melnikov.

12:59.878 --> 13:01.575
You are very angry with me.

13:02.069 --> 13:03.874
This is very personal to you.

13:04.711 --> 13:06.662
Your emotions are overpowering.

13:08.475 --> 13:09.792
You may step down.

13:10.983 --> 13:12.295
I'm going to call

13:13.141 --> 13:14.588
Mayko Binghampton.

13:18.186 --> 13:19.552
You did well, Robert.

13:37.919 --> 13:39.572
Would you please tell me your name?

13:40.143 --> 13:41.679
Mayko Tran Binghampton.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.521
Can I ask you your age?

13:43.641 --> 13:45.494
Did you ask anyone else their age?

13:46.974 --> 13:48.080
When were you born?

13:50.775 --> 13:52.918
April 2nd, 1980.

13:53.179 --> 13:55.726
- So that would make you...
- Older than you.

13:57.041 --> 14:01.417
So why is it that you appear
to be a woman in her late twenties?

14:01.774 --> 14:06.359
I contracted TTLV Strain 451
during the outbreak of 2023.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.483
I had extensive scaring, hair loss,

14:10.122 --> 14:11.769
internal organ damage...

14:11.889 --> 14:14.548
So I take it
that the way you appear today

14:14.668 --> 14:16.592
is due to extensive surgery.

14:16.857 --> 14:17.560
Yes.

14:18.343 --> 14:20.331
Artificial skin replacements, hair.

14:20.451 --> 14:21.966
I had a new liver,

14:22.379 --> 14:25.910
spleen and left lung regenerated
through my skin stem cells

14:26.449 --> 14:28.912
and I had my leg replaced

14:29.167 --> 14:31.768
when limb replacement surgery
became available,

14:31.888 --> 14:34.210
I guess that was a bit
of a vanity thing.

14:34.594 --> 14:37.162
So you believe in the science
of science.

14:37.577 --> 14:38.597
Yes I do.

14:39.122 --> 14:40.014
No regrets?

14:40.549 --> 14:41.268
None.

14:41.388 --> 14:43.332
No concerns about any of your surgeries?

14:43.452 --> 14:46.206
No. Why should I have concerns?
They're all standard procedure today.

14:46.326 --> 14:47.473
Yes, but at the time,

14:47.828 --> 14:51.231
some of what you had done
was considered highly experimental.

14:51.639 --> 14:53.033
I am a scientist.

14:53.549 --> 14:55.484
I believe in science.

14:55.703 --> 14:59.270
Experiments, research, that is
how we learn, it's how we get it right.

14:59.390 --> 15:01.695
So, do you think that science,

15:01.855 --> 15:04.304
as we see it today, is

15:05.204 --> 15:07.252
a responsible discipline?

15:08.283 --> 15:09.007
Yes.

15:09.127 --> 15:12.206
Even though,
according to the most recent research,

15:12.467 --> 15:16.986
it took the scientific community
35 years to realize

15:17.509 --> 15:21.283
that the flu pandemic of 2010
was directly responsible

15:21.403 --> 15:23.884
for the DNA mutation
of the Melnikov clone?

15:25.994 --> 15:27.831
I'm sorry, I wouldn't know.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.388
I didn't read the research.

15:31.197 --> 15:34.731
Well then as a scientist, perhaps you
can tell me why it took NorBAC so long

15:34.851 --> 15:37.690
to become involved
in the flu pandemic of 2010.

15:41.229 --> 15:42.075
Well...

15:43.825 --> 15:45.281
we were a little bit

15:45.977 --> 15:47.901
disorganized back then.

15:50.071 --> 15:51.649
We had a lot going on...

15:55.019 --> 15:57.081
- Where the hell have you been?
- Around.

15:57.201 --> 16:00.511
- David, I've been looking for you...
- Take that stupid mask off!

16:00.631 --> 16:02.647
Do you even know
how bad it's getting out there?

16:02.767 --> 16:04.520
I got a pretty good idea.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.208
I got your message, I came back.
What do you got for me?

16:07.328 --> 16:08.957
Riddlemeyer quit last week.

16:09.077 --> 16:11.057
- Why?
- I don't know. Other interests.

16:11.389 --> 16:14.331
Now we've got this new guy,
Krutchmeyer somebody,

16:14.951 --> 16:17.813
who's an idiot. He doesn't know
a Petri dish from a sequencer.

16:18.891 --> 16:20.691
Assuming NorBAC is all over this flu.

16:20.851 --> 16:23.271
No. We're all over the place, David.

16:23.391 --> 16:25.571
We're getting nowhere.
Have you read the latest numbers?

16:25.932 --> 16:28.907
I've been on a mountain talking to yaks
for the last two months, Mayko.

16:29.068 --> 16:32.361
The next time you need to take a break,
could you go somewhere with internet?

16:32.481 --> 16:33.825
How bad is it?

16:34.667 --> 16:36.332
We're dealing with a massive pandemic.

16:36.492 --> 16:39.931
We've got simultaneous explosions
of infections in Berlin, Brussels,

16:40.051 --> 16:41.128
Paris and London.

16:41.288 --> 16:43.077
- You sure it's the same virus?
- Identical.

16:43.266 --> 16:46.293
And it seems to be uncontainable.
It's slipping out of quarantines,

16:46.413 --> 16:49.452
popping up in places it shouldn't be:
clinics, hospitals.

16:49.572 --> 16:51.456
Nobody have has any idea why...

16:51.794 --> 16:53.561
So far it's up to 22 countries.

16:53.701 --> 16:56.376
- Still no patient zero?
- Not even close to any containment.

16:58.507 --> 16:59.955
Oh my God!

17:00.075 --> 17:01.482
Where did you come from?

17:01.642 --> 17:03.260
Just got in last night.

17:04.380 --> 17:05.348
Hello my friend.

17:06.271 --> 17:07.390
Oh, man...

17:08.015 --> 17:10.366
I thought
I was never gonna see you again.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.640
- Hello David.
- Jesus!

17:15.576 --> 17:16.894
Did you pull this off?

17:17.013 --> 17:19.077
You just gotta know who to lean on.

17:19.598 --> 17:21.955
I started PCRs on the strain
to check for genetic drift.

17:22.076 --> 17:23.628
I pulled the latest data for you.

17:23.888 --> 17:25.881
I started to put your office
back together.

17:27.075 --> 17:30.280
Say something, David.
The world's waiting to shit on us.

17:31.326 --> 17:32.688
Let's get to work.

17:33.870 --> 17:37.893
No, I'm curious. Why was this particular
virus so hard to contain?

17:39.102 --> 17:41.438
Because we weren't looking
in the right places.

17:41.598 --> 17:43.565
Are you suggesting incompetence?

17:43.825 --> 17:45.230
Absolutely not.

17:45.350 --> 17:48.789
Then why weren't you looking
in all the right places?

18:01.315 --> 18:04.253
- You wanted a virologist named Enuka?
- Okimba. You find her?

18:04.413 --> 18:07.756
- Flying in today via the military.
- Great. What about Jill?

18:08.199 --> 18:11.593
She last worked at Scripps in La Jolla,
quit a year ago and is MIA.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.224
How you doing?

18:15.994 --> 18:17.723
Moved back in,
trying to get up to speed.

18:17.843 --> 18:20.092
- I've got so much to catch up on.
- I mean...

18:20.417 --> 18:21.877
How you doing, Wes?

18:22.590 --> 18:23.390
Great.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.188
The stem cell therapy on the liver took.
The HCV is eradicated

18:27.308 --> 18:29.111
and we're really close on the HIV, so...

18:29.555 --> 18:31.405
A walking testimonial to science, hey?

18:32.701 --> 18:34.318
I missed it around here.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.339
I'm sorry about Rachel.

18:45.898 --> 18:46.962
Welcome back.

18:49.180 --> 18:50.218
Thank you.

18:53.873 --> 18:55.592
NorBAC wasn't the only lab

18:55.712 --> 18:58.265
- working on the virus at this time.
- God, no.

18:58.961 --> 19:01.119
I think every lab in the world
was testing,

19:01.239 --> 19:03.020
treating, doing whatever they could.

19:03.420 --> 19:05.439
Then why don't we focus
on what you do know?

19:06.683 --> 19:08.025
What was NorBAC doing?

19:08.573 --> 19:12.215
I got the latest from Europe. Patients
in hospitals have doubled overnight.

19:12.335 --> 19:14.782
Homeland Security has issued
a statement suggesting terrorism.

19:15.001 --> 19:18.786
And it's shown up in South Africa,
so that's 6 countries on that continent.

19:18.946 --> 19:20.746
But we still get conflicting ID reports.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.957
Wait a minute, I thought it was
confirmed that it was the same strain.

19:24.210 --> 19:27.358
We think we are but other labs
working on this strain aren't so sure.

19:27.478 --> 19:28.629
Okay, I trust us,

19:28.929 --> 19:30.532
so let's operate on the assumption

19:30.652 --> 19:33.008
that we're dealing with the same strain
universally. What else?

19:33.168 --> 19:36.044
We're looking at high mortality rates
in 11 centers.

19:36.164 --> 19:39.921
And this was just 72 h into the initial
reports of the outbreak.

19:40.041 --> 19:42.893
And the numbers doubled again
after that night.

19:43.053 --> 19:46.037
So what took so long
to shut down the airports,

19:46.157 --> 19:48.232
contain the borders,
shut down the schools?

19:48.392 --> 19:49.712
This was 2010.

19:50.006 --> 19:52.565
A flu epidemic hit generally every year

19:52.685 --> 19:54.929
and most people, the elderly,

19:55.691 --> 19:58.579
were advised to get flu shots
but just like going to the moon,

19:58.699 --> 20:00.744
- it became commonplace.
- But this was not...

20:02.035 --> 20:03.857
just a "commonplace" flu!

20:06.327 --> 20:07.327
No it wasn't.

20:07.447 --> 20:10.220
The pandemic's been noticed in...
What was it...

20:10.687 --> 20:14.137
987 urban locations
in North and South America,

20:14.257 --> 20:16.718
- Africa, Asia and Europe.
- Nothing in the Middle East?

20:17.974 --> 20:19.972
Is that why Homeland
is thinking terrorism?

20:20.214 --> 20:23.574
The outbreaks were simultaneous.
They don't think that's a coincidence.

20:24.159 --> 20:25.633
What about Australia?

20:26.061 --> 20:28.845
Got a border shut down in place.
They sealed up every entry point

20:28.965 --> 20:31.874
- after the first alert was posted.
- Civil aviation in North America

20:31.994 --> 20:34.069
will be shut down at 10:30 tonight.

20:35.113 --> 20:36.113
Anything else?

20:36.325 --> 20:39.591
127 Muslims were killed
in retaliation attacks.

20:40.062 --> 20:42.063
Fucking TV! They don't even know
it's terrorism.

20:42.183 --> 20:45.330
- They're throwing gasoline on the fire.
- How would you like me to spin this?

20:45.978 --> 20:47.082
I don't know, Wes.

20:47.686 --> 20:48.759
Tell them...

20:50.192 --> 20:53.172
- Just make something positive up.
- There's half a million people dying.

20:54.108 --> 20:55.507
It's gonna take some work.

20:57.437 --> 21:00.231
Look, let's focus on what we know
we can deal with.

21:00.351 --> 21:03.210
Enuka, where are we at
with the identification?

21:03.447 --> 21:05.142
We're not 100% sure yet.

21:05.302 --> 21:07.512
But the sequence analysis
suggests a variant

21:07.632 --> 21:09.438
of a couple of different flu strains.

21:10.348 --> 21:11.920
These results are from flu kits.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.302
Why haven't they done
a complete sequence to ID the strain?

21:14.422 --> 21:17.093
- The flu kits are fast...
- They're non-specific.

21:17.213 --> 21:19.620
There's like an error rate of 60%,

21:19.740 --> 21:21.634
that's with trained personnel
doing them.

21:21.754 --> 21:25.009
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
Since so many lab techs are sick,

21:25.129 --> 21:27.512
- that's all the hospitals have to use.
- Sick lab techs?

21:27.632 --> 21:30.034
All the outbreaks, attacks, whatever,

21:30.282 --> 21:32.377
they were first noticed
in hospitals and clinics.

21:33.423 --> 21:34.298
Okay...

21:34.728 --> 21:35.531
Okay.

21:35.976 --> 21:37.056
So we got...

21:38.181 --> 21:39.344
lab techs.

21:40.543 --> 21:41.939
We got hospitals.

21:42.877 --> 21:45.307
We got clinics. What else?

21:45.467 --> 21:47.643
The first sick
aren't patients or doctors,

21:47.803 --> 21:50.308
they're what they call
windowless workers:

21:50.428 --> 21:52.855
cleaning staff, lab scientists,
audiology...

21:52.975 --> 21:55.734
- Basement workers essentially.
- Wait a minute...

21:56.034 --> 21:56.836
What?

22:00.354 --> 22:01.323
Holy shit.

22:01.745 --> 22:02.847
What is it?

22:06.402 --> 22:08.288
This looks a hell of a lot like...

22:11.251 --> 22:12.665
Like Spanish flu.

22:13.409 --> 22:14.623
How can you know that?

22:14.743 --> 22:16.963
Just take a look
at the protein signatures.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.913
It might be a variant,
but that is the fucking Spanish flu.

22:20.033 --> 22:22.738
I'd recognize that as well
as I'd recognize my own hand writing.

22:22.858 --> 22:24.116
Mike? David Sandström.

22:24.236 --> 22:26.920
I need to get my hands on one of those
microarray chips we were working on.

22:27.666 --> 22:29.722
I know it's not complete. Listen...

22:30.190 --> 22:32.600
It'll be faster and more accurate
than anything we've got.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.044
And we need answers now.

22:34.164 --> 22:36.208
Where did this chip come from?

22:38.908 --> 22:40.358
How did you design the chip

22:40.478 --> 22:43.191
to be able to sequence
the Spanish flu so effectively?

22:43.934 --> 22:45.307
Well, I was helping

22:46.333 --> 22:47.269
develop

22:47.841 --> 22:51.156
the chip with some researchers
from McGill University in Montreal.

22:52.836 --> 22:54.835
Spanish flu is one of my passions.

22:55.569 --> 22:56.461
Illegally?

22:56.761 --> 22:57.586
What?

22:57.706 --> 23:00.549
You were designing the chip
without government approval.

23:01.282 --> 23:02.082
We...

23:03.206 --> 23:07.066
At the time, we didn't have Big Brother
telling us what we could

23:07.186 --> 23:09.994
or could not do. We could research,
we could...

23:10.114 --> 23:12.603
experiment without the permission
of some...

23:13.909 --> 23:16.331
arbitrary board of overseers.

23:17.100 --> 23:20.641
I take it you were opposed
to the Singapore Accord of 2032.

23:22.498 --> 23:25.447
I don't like anybody telling me
what I'm allowed

23:25.567 --> 23:26.819
to learn about,

23:27.635 --> 23:29.121
or wonder at, think.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.970
Do you think if that Accord
were in place when you were researching

23:34.090 --> 23:36.335
a way to help Bob Melnikov Senior

23:36.811 --> 23:38.357
repair his eyesight,

23:39.207 --> 23:41.988
that we would be in the situation
as we're in today?

23:43.616 --> 23:47.278
What do you think is more important:
knowledge or imagination?

23:48.255 --> 23:51.391
I don't think that that question
has any place in this inquiry.

23:51.551 --> 23:54.186
No, just answer the question.
Maybe I can help you out.

23:55.262 --> 23:56.550
Well, I guess...

23:57.821 --> 23:59.566
I guess I would say knowledge.

24:01.224 --> 24:03.701
That's why you're a lawyer.
No offense.

24:04.971 --> 24:06.698
Scientists use knowledge.

24:07.804 --> 24:10.132
But when you have to break new ground,

24:10.252 --> 24:13.538
you have to use your imagination.
You have to speculate,

24:14.427 --> 24:15.781
theorize, hypothesize.

24:17.175 --> 24:19.795
Sometimes you can fantasize
for inspiration.

24:20.261 --> 24:23.759
And in your wildest imaginings,
did you anticipate

24:24.637 --> 24:27.081
the death of close to a billion people

24:28.112 --> 24:30.055
because of the Melnikov clone?

24:32.005 --> 24:34.361
In my wildest imaginings,

24:37.148 --> 24:38.191
all I saw

24:39.557 --> 24:40.924
were tears of joy

24:41.855 --> 24:43.917
in the eyes of my dearest friend

24:45.169 --> 24:46.931
as he regained his sight.

24:48.443 --> 24:50.158
Let's get back to the microchip.

24:50.916 --> 24:52.285
Please, continue.

24:53.946 --> 24:55.756
Look, the sequencing chip

24:56.643 --> 24:59.308
may have been illegal
by today's standards,

24:59.428 --> 25:02.003
but at the time,
it was really quite revolutionary.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.078
We were in the middle of a crisis.

25:06.298 --> 25:08.048
So I went back to work...

25:09.049 --> 25:11.430
with every tool I had available to me.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.397
OK, what do we got?

25:48.152 --> 25:49.915
Here it is. Spanish flu.

25:51.102 --> 25:54.473
I don't know whether to celebrate
or to fall on my knees and pray.

25:55.073 --> 25:57.361
Wait a second, how is that possible?

25:58.151 --> 26:00.936
How can you have
simultaneous outbreaks of flu strains

26:01.056 --> 26:03.310
with exactly the same genetic code?
It's impossible.

26:03.430 --> 26:05.317
Viruses evolve, they mutate.

26:05.781 --> 26:06.610
Yeah...

26:08.188 --> 26:09.696
Well that's not natural.

26:09.856 --> 26:12.906
Maybe Homeland does have something
with this terrorism theory.

26:14.916 --> 26:18.011
Get it out there,
let them know what we're up against.

26:20.461 --> 26:21.627
Jill Langston

26:22.043 --> 26:25.786
designed a vaccine
for the Spanish Flu in 2005.

26:26.828 --> 26:30.373
But not one single government
felt the need to stockpile it.

26:31.193 --> 26:32.616
And if we did have stockpiles,

26:32.736 --> 26:35.680
do you feel the pandemic would
have been stopped in its tracks?

26:35.989 --> 26:38.266
Things wouldn't have gotten
as bad as it got.

26:38.637 --> 26:39.643
Dr. Binghampton?

26:39.803 --> 26:40.673
I agree.

26:41.060 --> 26:43.544
Then why did the WHO, the CDC

26:43.664 --> 26:46.983
and 60 major drug companies
all disagree with you?

26:47.143 --> 26:49.650
Because it hadn't been
around for decades.

26:49.770 --> 26:52.530
- Supply and demand.
- Nobody stockpiled vaccines

26:52.690 --> 26:55.283
because nobody thought
you could make a buck off it!

26:55.846 --> 26:59.246
So once you discovered it was
the Spanish Flu, what did you do?

26:59.830 --> 27:03.885
Our mandate was to identify
where the outbreak occurred.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.223
Was it terrorism or...

27:06.851 --> 27:08.045
something else?

27:08.165 --> 27:12.081
<i>While the Spanish Flu ravages
the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa,</i>

27:12.362 --> 27:15.762
<i>with daily death tolls now estimated
into the hundreds of thousands</i>

27:16.187 --> 27:19.841
<i>the one safe haven on the globe
continues to be Australia.</i>

27:20.288 --> 27:23.387
<i>Today the emergency coalition government
announced that it turned away</i>

27:23.507 --> 27:26.950
<i>5 refugee ships that had entered
its territorial waters.</i>

27:27.070 --> 27:29.730
<i>The government
also passed legislation...</i>

27:29.850 --> 27:31.716
- First outbreak in Finland.
- Hospital?

27:31.836 --> 27:33.881
Hospital.
Patient zero is a microbiologist.

27:34.001 --> 27:37.200
- Testing for the flu, he gets it.
- But from whom? No one had it.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.787
It's a classic flu transmission.
Somebody's...

27:39.907 --> 27:42.590
sick with something, they're weak,
they get the flu, and they die.

27:42.710 --> 27:45.744
Then the health care workers get sick
everybody thinks they're patient zero.

27:45.864 --> 27:49.514
But microbiologists, if anybody,
would take precaution, David.

27:50.013 --> 27:52.513
Must be an incredibly contagious strain.

27:52.719 --> 27:54.619
No, we're missing something.

27:57.213 --> 28:00.313
The scientific community
had been warning the world

28:00.618 --> 28:03.314
that we were destined
for a major pandemic.

28:04.468 --> 28:07.632
While everyone was out renting
"An Inconvenient Truth",

28:07.752 --> 28:09.566
nobody was listening to us.

28:09.934 --> 28:12.777
Well, maybe you just didn't speak
loudly enough.

28:14.376 --> 28:16.755
You didn't know
David Sandström back then.

28:17.066 --> 28:19.694
I don't give a shit
about the pig farmers, alright?!

28:19.814 --> 28:21.734
The virus could be zoonotic!

28:22.976 --> 28:26.691
That means it could pass
between animals and humans, alright?

28:26.811 --> 28:30.661
So all the pigs along the Canadian-US
border have to be destroyed.

28:31.514 --> 28:33.089
Fuck that shit! Do it now!

28:33.249 --> 28:34.049
Hello?

28:35.850 --> 28:36.594
Wes!

28:40.231 --> 28:40.981
Fuck!

28:43.983 --> 28:45.024
What's up?

28:45.679 --> 28:46.779
Could you please

28:46.899 --> 28:50.252
call someone in Washington
and tell them to stop shipping

28:50.372 --> 28:53.369
pigs, and cattle, and chickens
and I don't know,

28:53.489 --> 28:56.488
fucking elephants across the border.
They could be carriers!

28:56.648 --> 28:58.391
Fine. 
Someone would like to speak to you.

28:58.511 --> 29:01.284
I don't have time right now.
Where's Mayko with those charts?

29:01.445 --> 29:04.769
- You're gonna want to talk to him.
- I said I don't have...

29:07.621 --> 29:08.321
Hey.

29:09.366 --> 29:10.316
Oh my God.

29:13.686 --> 29:15.507
This is my son, David.

29:16.658 --> 29:18.580
Robert Crick Melnikov Junior.

29:20.935 --> 29:21.814
Robert,

29:22.625 --> 29:24.099
this is David.

29:24.890 --> 29:25.597
Hi.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.233
He knows he's...

29:28.544 --> 29:30.480
He's been told
he's not supposed to touch anyone.

29:31.891 --> 29:32.695
Germs.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.141
- Hey.
- Hey, Mayko.

29:35.510 --> 29:38.920
- Hi, how are you?
- Good. This is,

29:39.418 --> 29:40.836
this is Robert Jr.

29:41.059 --> 29:43.027
Robert, this is Mayko.

29:45.922 --> 29:47.172
I want to help.

29:48.896 --> 29:50.417
I want my job back.

29:51.902 --> 29:54.253
How does Nina feel
about you coming back?

29:57.359 --> 29:58.842
We buried her 11 days ago.

30:04.120 --> 30:07.595
I've been testing myself and Robert Jr.

30:09.751 --> 30:12.287
And we're not contagious.

30:14.373 --> 30:16.295
Did you hear about Carlton Riddlemeyer?

30:16.415 --> 30:17.318
I did.

30:19.690 --> 30:20.533
David.

30:20.791 --> 30:22.174
It's in Australia.

30:22.865 --> 30:24.839
Six people who work together.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.964
- In a hospital? Where'd they work?
- Some sort of a warehouse.

30:29.084 --> 30:30.582
Medical Arts Surgical Supplies.

30:34.262 --> 30:36.621
- Hospital supply house. Shit.
- What?

30:36.903 --> 30:40.175
What are they supplying?
Catheters? Sheets? Flu kits?

30:40.335 --> 30:41.134
Shit.

30:41.294 --> 30:42.676
I'll look into it.

30:42.981 --> 30:44.833
And that was that.

30:45.852 --> 30:49.058
So, we were finally
able to focus in the right place.

30:49.822 --> 30:51.867
The flu pandemic of 2010

30:53.145 --> 30:57.261
that killed 189 million men,
women and children

30:58.586 --> 31:00.976
was started by a manufacturing error.

31:01.961 --> 31:05.283
They distributed Flu test kits
to 2,500 labs around the world.

31:05.443 --> 31:08.185
- Contaminated kits?
- Apparently, somebody accidentally

31:08.305 --> 31:10.288
put in a live virus
instead of an attenuated one.

31:10.448 --> 31:12.624
Accidentally or on purpose.

31:12.784 --> 31:14.125
You got a manufacturer?

31:14.285 --> 31:16.419
ValTest.
FBI is speaking to them right now.

31:17.391 --> 31:19.088
Okay, ValTest.

31:19.598 --> 31:20.714
It says here

31:20.875 --> 31:23.468
they're the biggest manufacturer
of flu viruses in the world.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.013
Great. Okay, we've ID-ed it.
We have a source.

31:27.173 --> 31:30.522
Let's see if we can figure out
how to contain this fucking thing.

31:32.639 --> 31:34.244
Welcome back everyone.

31:36.107 --> 31:39.275
The death toll would have tripled
if we hadn't caught that mistake.

31:40.372 --> 31:43.951
I'm talking about the damage done
to the Melnikov clone.

31:47.420 --> 31:49.963
Why don't you just call her.

31:50.927 --> 31:52.582
Get her up on the stand.

31:55.741 --> 31:57.544
You're dismissed, Dr. Binghampton.

31:58.839 --> 31:59.879
Thank you.

32:00.250 --> 32:03.519
I would like to call
Dr. Lilith Sandström.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.163
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

32:14.365 --> 32:16.141
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

32:17.598 --> 32:19.126
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hi.

32:31.381 --> 32:32.996
State your name.

32:33.464 --> 32:35.665
Lilith Sandström Bersherac.

32:36.105 --> 32:39.468
- And your occupation?
- I'm a Paleovirologist.

32:40.575 --> 32:43.006
What you would call a Genetic Historian.

32:43.166 --> 32:46.009
And can you tell us
why you are here today?

32:50.395 --> 32:52.226
Three months ago,

32:52.346 --> 32:56.064
my research lab began collecting data
on the Melnikov lineage.

32:56.721 --> 32:59.174
We still need to do
the clinical research.

32:59.924 --> 33:02.197
This is some very compelling stuff.

33:02.643 --> 33:03.826
It's a start.

33:04.751 --> 33:05.748
No, I...

33:06.843 --> 33:08.698
I think you pretty much nailed it.

33:09.024 --> 33:09.786
Shit.

33:11.024 --> 33:13.953
- I still have a lot of work to do.
- Of course you do.

33:15.937 --> 33:17.582
You need to publish this.

33:17.877 --> 33:18.999
You really think so?

33:19.234 --> 33:20.124
Yeah.

33:23.779 --> 33:24.692
Dad,

33:25.130 --> 33:28.255
if we confirm
the Melnikov lineage is the source...

33:28.705 --> 33:30.386
This could be a witch hunt.

33:31.648 --> 33:33.322
We're not gonna let that happen.

33:35.860 --> 33:39.437
And could you summarize
the Retrovirus Analysis

33:39.597 --> 33:40.882
of Robert Melnikov?

33:41.304 --> 33:43.524
You have to understand
this is preliminary data

33:43.685 --> 33:45.312
we're still reviewing.

33:45.432 --> 33:48.321
But convincing enough for you
to feel necessary to publish.

33:50.634 --> 33:54.561
Now could you please explain
what you discovered three months ago.

33:56.499 --> 33:58.706
When Robert Melnikov was infected

33:58.867 --> 34:01.334
during the influenza pandemic of 2010,

34:01.937 --> 34:05.380
retroviruses in his body
were reactivated.

34:05.540 --> 34:09.656
I'm sorry, could you explain
what an endogenous retrovirus is?

34:10.536 --> 34:13.764
More or less, a parasite fossilized

34:13.884 --> 34:16.818
in our DNA for millions of years.

34:16.938 --> 34:20.338
It's in all our cells, including cells
critical for our reproduction:

34:20.641 --> 34:21.974
sperm, egg.

34:22.404 --> 34:24.565
Every patient zero from every outbreak

34:24.725 --> 34:27.000
is a confirmed Melnikov test tube baby.

34:28.563 --> 34:32.520
What about Robert? Is he contagious?
Is he one of these viral factories?

34:33.130 --> 34:35.034
Astoundingly, no.

34:35.451 --> 34:37.804
It appears he's immune to whatever

34:37.925 --> 34:39.757
activates them in his lineage.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.902
It still makes him
the direct genetic link

34:43.023 --> 34:45.335
to this whole new generation
of retroviruses.

34:49.928 --> 34:51.522
Okay, we've gotta fix it.

34:53.245 --> 34:56.292
We need to evaluate
some kind of quarantine protocol.

35:01.940 --> 35:03.276
How old is he?

35:03.792 --> 35:06.190
The oldest
of the Melnikov test tube babies.

35:06.628 --> 35:08.128
William Bergman?

35:08.479 --> 35:09.986
He's 17 next month.

35:10.146 --> 35:11.333
And the youngest?

35:13.061 --> 35:15.742
I don't know.
Thousands will be born next year.

35:19.121 --> 35:20.830
Here's what we're gonna do.

35:22.149 --> 35:24.373
We're gonna do the best that we can
to make these people

35:24.493 --> 35:26.339
as comfortable as we can.

35:27.502 --> 35:31.340
Put all your wrote data on the internet,
make it accessible to anybody.

35:32.380 --> 35:35.606
We're gonna put together
the best virologists we can find.

35:35.883 --> 35:38.606
We're gonna be damn sure
that we don't end up in some...

35:38.873 --> 35:41.896
inquisition room
where they make use seem like a bunch of

35:42.288 --> 35:43.659
bungling buffoons.

35:44.223 --> 35:45.813
Let me put this all together.

35:46.833 --> 35:50.955
Nina Corba and Olivier Roth
were successful

35:51.362 --> 35:55.281
in cloning a human fetus in 2008.

35:56.861 --> 35:59.908
Human cloning was,
at that time, illegal.

36:00.404 --> 36:02.345
That was a long time ago.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.061
That clone's DNA was altered

36:05.181 --> 36:08.419
after infection
with a virulent flu strain.

36:08.579 --> 36:11.356
- Which no one could have anticipated.
- ... that eventually opened the door

36:11.476 --> 36:15.259
to a multitude of viruses that have laid
dormant in the human species

36:15.652 --> 36:17.178
for millions of years.

36:19.792 --> 36:21.265
The altered DNA

36:21.425 --> 36:23.458
was spread when it was used as...

36:23.903 --> 36:26.458
special "empathy" sperm

36:26.908 --> 36:31.122
for the in vitro fertilization
of 3.2 million women.

36:33.272 --> 36:34.129
Now,

36:34.434 --> 36:35.957
we can directly link

36:36.215 --> 36:39.617
the CTLV virus of 2022

36:40.067 --> 36:43.454
that killed 13 million people,

36:44.380 --> 36:45.786
to the descendents

36:46.117 --> 36:48.000
of the Melnikov experiment.

36:50.121 --> 36:54.220
The Cambium cell epidemic,
from 2025 to 2027,

36:54.340 --> 36:57.546
took 22 million lives.

36:58.015 --> 37:00.183
- It too came from...
- Alright stop it.

37:00.303 --> 37:03.160
... Robert Melnikov Jr.

37:05.553 --> 37:08.104
The HIV-4 strain outbreak

37:08.264 --> 37:11.164
of 2034, six million dead.

37:11.284 --> 37:12.535
I said: Stop it!

37:15.973 --> 37:17.543
We faced those pandemics

37:18.703 --> 37:20.741
and we dealt with them,
we learnt from them.

37:20.901 --> 37:22.219
At what cost?

37:27.165 --> 37:30.047
We are not here to dispute the facts.

37:32.157 --> 37:34.422
The question is: What is to be done

37:34.582 --> 37:36.868
- with the children?
- Dr. Sandström.

37:38.625 --> 37:42.315
This inquiry was called
after a classified document,

37:42.435 --> 37:46.453
written in conjunction with
the Consortium of the Unified Nations,

37:47.094 --> 37:48.378
questioned whether

37:48.498 --> 37:51.467
the current direction
of the scientific community

37:51.587 --> 37:53.718
is aggressive enough.

37:54.101 --> 37:55.902
That's just fucking bullshit!

37:56.391 --> 37:59.105
There are over 150 labs
all around the world

37:59.225 --> 38:01.324
currently picking apart
those retroviruses,

38:01.484 --> 38:05.930
finding out how they reproduce
in the human body, how they stay alive!

38:06.050 --> 38:08.526
Well isn't that just
a waste of time and money?

38:08.646 --> 38:09.654
You have to know

38:09.896 --> 38:13.461
how something lives before
you can understand how it will die.

38:13.621 --> 38:15.912
And in the three months
since you began this work,

38:16.032 --> 38:18.426
how close are you to a solution?

38:18.918 --> 38:20.885
It could be right around the corner

38:21.199 --> 38:22.929
or it could be halfway to heaven.

38:23.346 --> 38:25.784
But we learn something new everyday.

38:26.300 --> 38:29.944
And do you agree that everyday
there are still these...

38:30.064 --> 38:33.108
these viral factories
walking amongst us.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.504
Quarantining

38:35.020 --> 38:38.957
3.2 million children
under the age of 18 is...

38:40.270 --> 38:42.191
challenging, yes.

38:42.718 --> 38:44.575
But I have met some of these kids.

38:45.554 --> 38:47.054
They are empathic.

38:47.476 --> 38:49.163
And they know where's at stake.

38:49.323 --> 38:53.084
No, we haven't got them all contained,
we need more money, more facilities.

38:53.244 --> 38:55.568
And so far, 4 trillion euros

38:55.908 --> 38:58.648
- has been spent on this program.
- And by the time this is over,

38:58.768 --> 39:00.596
we'll probably need another 4 trillion.

39:03.293 --> 39:06.508
The Consortium has recommended
an alternative approach.

39:06.628 --> 39:08.918
The Consortium
are a bunch of bureaucrats

39:09.038 --> 39:11.727
who should stick
to political science, not biological.

39:12.487 --> 39:14.981
The Consortium is recommending a humane

39:15.745 --> 39:19.167
eradication program
of the Melnikov lineage.

39:21.065 --> 39:22.237
That's insane.

39:23.479 --> 39:26.313
They recommend that
the program take effect immediately,

39:26.433 --> 39:28.869
and that the remains
be properly incinerated

39:29.029 --> 39:31.272
for the protection
of the general population.

39:36.408 --> 39:37.308
Hope...

39:39.821 --> 39:41.340
Those human beings,

39:43.252 --> 39:45.108
they've contracted a condition

39:46.271 --> 39:47.730
not of their own doing

39:47.850 --> 39:50.377
and you are willing
to turn your backs on them

39:50.705 --> 39:53.540
rather than allow us
the chance to find a solution.

39:53.660 --> 39:54.478
No,

39:54.638 --> 39:57.102
the recommendation
is meant to save the lives

39:57.222 --> 40:00.879
of 7 billion people
living on this planet.

40:01.309 --> 40:02.413
And you think...

40:02.773 --> 40:06.946
You think they'll be safe
if the Melnikov lineage is wiped out?

40:07.400 --> 40:11.461
Why risk a definitive solution
for the hope of a cure?

40:11.697 --> 40:13.602
Because that's how we'll endure!

40:14.255 --> 40:16.417
By solving our problems,
not running away.

40:17.856 --> 40:21.115
Because by learning
how to stop the Melnikov viruses,

40:21.425 --> 40:24.175
we may just learn
how to stop the last virus.

40:24.704 --> 40:26.144
The "last virus"?

40:29.252 --> 40:30.236
Someday,

40:31.520 --> 40:34.820
a virus could evolve
to be so perfectly efficient

40:36.392 --> 40:39.607
that it will destroy
every living thing on this planet.

40:41.720 --> 40:42.656
The end.

40:43.820 --> 40:45.380
The end of our species.

40:46.772 --> 40:48.272
The end of everything.

40:50.636 --> 40:52.292
And it's going to happen.

40:53.228 --> 40:55.952
No matter
how many corpses you throw in the fire.

40:56.072 --> 40:58.748
No matter
whether you're prepared or not.

41:02.383 --> 41:04.047
Science makes mistakes.

41:05.899 --> 41:07.586
But science is a journey.

41:08.055 --> 41:10.164
The road is long and with every step,

41:11.125 --> 41:12.812
we learn a little bit more.

41:14.385 --> 41:15.226
So,

41:16.070 --> 41:19.750
you want us
to just put our trust in science.

41:23.101 --> 41:24.906
I want you to believe in it.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.797
I want you to ask yourself:

41:30.180 --> 41:31.890
Have we gone far enough?

41:33.578 --> 41:36.226
And if you find
that the answer is "yes",

41:37.844 --> 41:38.687
fine.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.064
You stop.

41:42.883 --> 41:44.477
But don't ask me to stop.

41:44.777 --> 41:46.670
I can't see the end of the road.

41:47.983 --> 41:49.970
And if you just let me keep going,

41:51.283 --> 41:53.177
as far as I can, I promise,

41:54.302 --> 41:57.434
I will prove to you
that there is nothing to be afraid of.

41:57.827 --> 41:59.402
That it's just shadows.

41:59.722 --> 42:01.208
That 3.2 million people

42:01.328 --> 42:04.348
do not have to die
because of fear and ignorance.

42:04.468 --> 42:07.802
And that what has happened here today
need never happen again.

42:11.618 --> 42:13.235
Thank you, Dr. Sandström.

42:51.357 --> 42:52.654
You think he's dead?

42:52.936 --> 42:53.920
I dunno.

43:05.738 --> 43:06.770
He's dead.

43:07.637 --> 43:10.216
Holy shit. I've never seen a dead guy.

43:10.520 --> 43:11.504
Me neither.

43:12.169 --> 43:13.309
What do we do?

43:16.930 --> 43:18.057
Did you see that?

43:20.481 --> 43:21.769
You okay, Mister?

43:24.583 --> 43:25.825
You're bleeding.

43:28.895 --> 43:29.718
Bob?

44:14.872 --> 44:16.231
Where are we going?

45:30.116 --> 45:34.001
