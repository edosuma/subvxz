This is me.

05:00.341 --> 05:01.175
No.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.264
I don't know anything.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.184
No, still nothing.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.189
Yeah.

05:18.609 --> 05:19.861
Uh, no, I mean.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.741
All I know is whatever's in the news.

05:27.785 --> 05:30.204
I mean, whatever you read and I read

05:30.204 --> 05:32.206
in the news is what I know, so.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.421
Mm-hm.

05:40.089 --> 05:42.216
Yeah. (sighs)

05:43.468 --> 05:44.302
Yeah, I.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.306
I heard that the little girl died.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.602
'Kay.

05:53.853 --> 05:54.687

Blizzard.

06:25.968 --> 06:29.806
Blizzard, here precious. (tongue clicking)

06:29.806 --> 06:31.099
Here kitty, kitty.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.226
Stupid cat.

06:37.897 --> 06:38.898
Oh what the fuck?

06:41.526 --> 06:42.527
Where the hell am I?

06:44.320 --> 06:45.488
- Thank you, Clifton.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.991
More on last weeks
six-car pileup on the I-47

06:48.991 --> 06:50.743
that claimed the life of--

06:50.743 --> 06:51.577
- Really?

06:54.831 --> 06:57.208
(dramatic music)

06:57.208 --> 07:00.169
(Pertreena gagging)

07:09.887 --> 07:12.431
What the hell is happening?

07:12.431 --> 07:14.392
(door knocking)

07:14.392 --> 07:16.102
- [Blake] You all right in there, Miss?

07:22.692 --> 07:23.526
- Riley!

07:25.945 --> 07:27.446
(door knocking)
- Hey, Chief.

07:28.364 --> 07:29.198
- So.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.492
- Nothing yet, Chief.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.787
I personally made the
rounds to every hospital

07:34.787 --> 07:37.039
and ER room within 30
miles before I get in.

07:37.915 --> 07:38.749
Nothing.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.419
Not even any prank calls.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.629
Which is surprising given

07:43.629 --> 07:46.299
how the news has blown
this up in the trades.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.467
- Yeah, we just have conspiracy
theorists at the diner

07:48.467 --> 07:52.096
and alien abduction, Jimmy
Hoffa and shit like that.

07:53.014 --> 07:53.931
- [Dispatch] Agent Greenley has--

07:53.931 --> 07:56.392
- Now what do you think
happened out there, Riley?

07:56.642 --> 07:58.519
- The same thing I told
you the night it happened.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.353
- Oh really.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.565
Oh, that's just great, Riley.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.735
Thanks for nothing, Riley.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.236
Get the hell out of here!

08:07.236 --> 08:08.237
- Sorry, Chief.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.824
(dramatic music)

08:26.297 --> 08:28.132
- Thought I'd better check in on you.

08:30.384 --> 08:31.969
- [Pertreena] Who are you?

08:31.969 --> 08:33.471
Where the hell am I?

08:33.471 --> 08:34.304
- May I come in?

08:35.389 --> 08:38.058
(ominous music)

08:57.078 --> 08:58.246
- Ow!

08:58.246 --> 09:01.249
- Sorry, I guess that's
still a little bit sore.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.416
- Where am I?

09:02.416 --> 09:04.377
How long have I been here?

09:04.377 --> 09:05.962
- Please, sit.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.548
- I think you should back off
and I'm calling the police.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.632
- I don't think that's such a good idea--

09:09.632 --> 09:10.841
- Who are you?

09:12.510 --> 09:15.012
- Blake Winton, this is my hotel.

09:18.099 --> 09:18.933
- Hotel?

09:21.227 --> 09:22.853
How did I get here?

09:22.853 --> 09:24.105
Did you drug me?

09:24.105 --> 09:26.399
Are you some kind of sex fiend?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.734
- No, nothing like that.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.194
But you're gonna want to sit.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.488
- All right, I've had enough of this,

09:32.488 --> 09:33.656
I'm leaving and you can go fuck yourself.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.491
(Blake groaning)
(Pertreena gasping)

09:35.491 --> 09:38.077
- Easy now, (groans) come on.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.745
Just sit down for a minute.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.415
- [Pertreena] Stop touching me. (groans)

09:51.340 --> 09:53.801
- You stumble in here a few days ago,

09:53.801 --> 09:55.136
hell of a mess you were.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.431
Took Genny, that's my wife,

09:58.431 --> 10:00.975
a good hour to get you cleaned up.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.393
(door knocking)

10:02.393 --> 10:04.145
(dramatic music)

10:04.145 --> 10:06.897
(door squeaking)

10:09.400 --> 10:12.903
- I thought maybe some
biscuits to start with.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.411
Oh my.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.204
- [Blake] Something huh?

10:22.204 --> 10:23.372
Barely a sign.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.127
- Did you tell her?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.296
I mean, everything about that night?

10:30.296 --> 10:34.759
- No, thought it would be
better with both of us here.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.136
It's not something anyone can prepare for.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.140
(ominous music)

10:54.195 --> 10:57.365
(dogs howling)

10:57.365 --> 10:58.199
- [Announcer] The high
this weekend will be

10:58.199 --> 11:00.201
a sunny 72 degrees.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.496
So enjoy some of the festivities
being planned around town.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.539
And don't forget to let
your kids give a ring

11:05.539 --> 11:06.957
of the town bell.

11:06.957 --> 11:09.543
(somber music)

11:11.796 --> 11:13.881
- In local news, as the investigation

11:13.881 --> 11:17.301
into the I-47 crash
continues to hit a dead end,

11:17.301 --> 11:19.512
day seven in the bizarre disappearance.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.848
- [Announcer] Talk in the
town has become sensational

11:22.848 --> 11:24.975
as townfolk offer the rumor

11:24.975 --> 11:26.394
on the disappearance of the body.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.646
As police continue to interview people

11:28.646 --> 11:29.980
who may have relevant information,

11:29.980 --> 11:33.484
people in town turn it's
attention to the victim.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.363
- Sadly, the youngest
victim, just six-years old.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.282
- No, no.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.662
No, no, no!

11:44.662 --> 11:46.997
No, it's not possible.

11:46.997 --> 11:47.832
Okay, it's something else.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.792
It's a bad dream, it's a bad, I coke.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.169
It's not some bad coke, it's a bad dream.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.295
That's all it is.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.130
I got, it's a fever!

11:54.130 --> 11:55.172
It's a fever or something.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.800
Something that's possible but not this!

11:57.800 --> 11:59.718
- I'm sorry, dear, there's forces

11:59.718 --> 12:02.096
in this universe we're not meant

12:02.096 --> 12:02.930
to understand.
- No!

12:02.930 --> 12:05.933
- [Genny] There are
forces in this universe.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.560
- No, it's something else!

12:07.560 --> 12:09.061
- I'm sorry, dear.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.441
(ominous music)

12:13.441 --> 12:14.275
I'm sorry.

12:21.824 --> 12:24.743
(Pertreena crying)

12:31.208 --> 12:32.835
- No!

12:32.835 --> 12:35.504
♪ Ah, ah ♪

12:35.504 --> 12:37.590
♪ Ah, ah ♪

12:40.176 --> 12:41.177
- It's time.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.013
You can show her now.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.396
(dramatic music)

12:52.396 --> 12:56.150
The night we found you, we
brought you to this room.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.696
We'd seen the news and
your pictures of course,

13:00.696 --> 13:02.531
didn't know quite what to make of it.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.367
- All the talk in town, you see,

13:05.367 --> 13:08.412
where's the body, who stole the body.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.539
Quite a stir for this town.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.792
- So what are you saying?

13:13.792 --> 13:17.505
That I'm some kind of undead thing?

13:18.422 --> 13:21.133
Some B-movie freak, is that
what you're trying to say?

13:24.678 --> 13:25.513
It's bullshit!

13:27.473 --> 13:28.641
No, I want to go home!

13:28.641 --> 13:32.853
I want my mom, she can
fix this, I know she can!

13:32.853 --> 13:35.606
(dramatic music)

13:36.857 --> 13:38.943
(birds chirping)

13:41.445 --> 13:43.864
(traffic whooshing)

13:43.864 --> 13:46.492
- Says here, she's owned
the Mystic Curio Shop

13:46.492 --> 13:50.037
on Juniper Avenue for
the past 20-plus years.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.957
- What the hell's a Mystic Curio Shop?

13:52.957 --> 13:54.667
Some voodoo shit?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.585
- (laughs) Something like that.

13:56.585 --> 13:59.713
Buys, sells and trades
occult paraphernalia.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.549
The hard to find items.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.676
- So why'd they pull
our shit on this call?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.470
More of a job for the local yahoos.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.889
- Mm, the police are still investigating.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.766
They're worried that the
mother may have snatched

14:10.766 --> 14:13.727
her daughter's body
for some occult ritual.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.981
Remember that incident
about two years ago?

14:16.981 --> 14:19.275
- In Coppersville, right.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.819
Hell of a mess.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.487
- Hell of a mess.

14:23.487 --> 14:26.407
They want to make sure
this isn't a copycat op.

14:26.407 --> 14:30.536
I guess the mother's some kind
of wacko, talks to the dead.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.248
Communicates with animal
spirits and the like.

14:35.749 --> 14:39.461
Oh, and it says here,
she likes the bottle.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.089
- That'll make you talk to the dead.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.632
- And make 'em talk back.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.593
- Fuck, another freak show.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.679
- Odd though.
- How's that?

14:50.306 --> 14:53.726
- The report says her
earlier file is sealed

14:53.726 --> 14:58.731
under federal protection by the
DOD on a need to know basis.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.442
- What the fuck does

15:01.442 --> 15:04.069
the Department of Defense want with her?

15:04.069 --> 15:05.279
- Doesn't say.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.489
Just that, they sealed her file.

15:07.489 --> 15:12.286
- I see, assign us a case but
leave us in the dark. (sighs)

15:12.286 --> 15:13.662
(detective sniffling)

15:13.662 --> 15:16.332
What, allergies?

15:16.332 --> 15:18.667
- You, wrap up that counseling
within the department?

15:18.667 --> 15:21.253
- Yeah, it's allergies.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.922
- All right, calm down DiCapri.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.424
I'm not your mother.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.134
Things any better at home?

15:27.134 --> 15:28.010
- She's out now.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.095
That's better.
- Mm-hm.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.726
Fuckin' lawyer's gonna drain me.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.269
- She still blaming you?

15:37.269 --> 15:39.480
- Til the day I'm lying
cold in the ground.

15:42.024 --> 15:42.941
Can't blame her.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.487
I was pretty strung out back then.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.365
Even more after the accident.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.788
God, he loved that pool.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.752
She's leaving the house.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.214
(engine revving)

16:05.214 --> 16:07.591
- Honey, Blake and I are here for you.

16:07.591 --> 16:08.801
- Don't touch me.

16:08.801 --> 16:09.760
- Right, dear.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.140
- There's just one more
thing you should know.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.558
- Really?

16:16.558 --> 16:18.060
There's more?

16:18.060 --> 16:20.437
- [Blake] You're being
blamed for the car crash.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.278
- I gotta go home.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.113
I want to go home.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.032
I want Bliz, I want my mom,
I want to go home, now.

16:32.032 --> 16:36.245
- [Genny] Honey! (sobbing)

16:36.245 --> 16:39.873
(crickets chirping)

16:39.873 --> 16:42.334
(dog barking)

16:44.920 --> 16:47.589
(keys rattling)

16:52.094 --> 16:54.596
(door squeaking)

16:54.596 --> 16:57.474
- Blizzard, (tongue clicking).

16:57.474 --> 17:00.144
(ominous music)

17:46.440 --> 17:49.318
(phone beeps)

17:49.318 --> 17:50.569
(phone ringing)

17:50.569 --> 17:55.574
(dramatic music)
(phone crackling)

17:57.910 --> 18:00.162
(door squeaking)

18:00.162 --> 18:02.664
(dog barking)

18:03.791 --> 18:06.543
(dramatic music)

18:09.338 --> 18:11.131
- What are you thinking?

18:11.131 --> 18:12.841
You've got that look on your face.

18:12.841 --> 18:15.719
- Something just doesn't add
up, doesn't make any sense.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.012
None of the pieces fit.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.681
- The Jacquem case?

18:19.681 --> 18:21.058
(Chief sighs)

18:21.058 --> 18:22.851
Any chance someone at
Mercy sold the corpse off

18:22.851 --> 18:24.478
to a research lab?

18:24.478 --> 18:25.604
- No, I already followed that

18:25.604 --> 18:27.439
and everybody there checks out clean.

18:31.985 --> 18:32.986
- Where is this from?

18:32.986 --> 18:34.530
- Oh no, don't start.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.200
It's been six years, Jackson!

18:39.368 --> 18:40.410
And now this?

18:40.410 --> 18:41.495
- I said not now!

18:42.913 --> 18:46.208
- This is not turning into
another Tennyson case.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.171
I don't think I can go through that again.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.466
You disappeared for three days.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.304
- Dammit, Sharon, the
whole town is buzzing.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.848
Just like before.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.641
This is my town, goddammit!

19:02.641 --> 19:04.852
- It was one unsolved case.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.186
One!

19:06.186 --> 19:07.020
Years ago.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.065
After how many years of service here?

19:11.191 --> 19:12.860
People just like to start trouble.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.570
- I don't like being the brunt of it.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.238
Remember what happened last time?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.156
I was harpooned by the papers for months.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.783
They kept asking, hey, Chief Redding,

19:19.783 --> 19:22.035
are you gonna ever close
that Tennyson case?

19:22.035 --> 19:24.121
And no more leads and shit like that.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.330
- I remember.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.164
I do.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.168
I remember it almost tore us apart.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.590
That's what you need to remember.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.176
(dramatic music)

19:40.846 --> 19:41.680
- Why Pertreena?

19:46.101 --> 19:47.769
Why did you kill me?

19:50.355 --> 19:53.275
Don't you wish you could be dead?

19:53.275 --> 19:55.944
(ominous music)

19:57.863 --> 20:00.240
♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪

20:08.290 --> 20:10.876
(gentle music)

20:15.047 --> 20:17.799
(dramatic music)

20:21.845 --> 20:23.221
(Pertreena sniffs)

20:23.221 --> 20:24.389
- Doog?
- Yeah.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.226
Who's this?

20:28.226 --> 20:29.478
- Dooger, it's me, Treen.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.104
- Oh, hey girl, how you been?

20:32.814 --> 20:33.690
- What do you mean, how have I been?

20:33.690 --> 20:34.650
Don't you know what happened?

20:34.650 --> 20:36.485
- No, I've been on the down for a while.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.111
Taz came up short in one of his bags

20:38.111 --> 20:41.323
and sent some cringes over to kick my ass.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.200
I've been on the down ever since that.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.661
Hold on a second.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.704
Listen motherfucker,
that's the street price.

20:48.705 --> 20:51.333
If you don't like it,
get the fuck out of here.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.251
(horn beeping)

20:53.251 --> 20:54.086
Sorry about that.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.087
These young kids think
they can come in here

20:55.087 --> 20:56.838
and negotiate with the Doog.

20:56.838 --> 20:57.923
Fuckin' losers.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.343
- Doog, I gotta see you.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.761
- [Doog] Tonight?

21:02.761 --> 21:04.596
- Yeah, tonight, now, now.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.725
- Okay, when and where?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.522
- Reid Park south side.
- Okay.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.440
- Dooger, you have to come alone.

21:17.818 --> 21:18.652
- Treen?

21:20.988 --> 21:23.532
You sound different, are you okay?

21:23.532 --> 21:25.534
- Just come alone.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.286
(dramatic music)

21:31.498 --> 21:33.000
- Thanks for coming.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.043
- I understand you pulled a sleeper file.

21:36.044 --> 21:36.920
(ominous music)

21:36.920 --> 21:37.754
Mother and daughter?

21:37.754 --> 21:39.423
- The mother was in sleeper program.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.259
She got pregnant after
Justice shut it down.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.176
She gave birth at home.

21:43.176 --> 21:46.430
She was one of those
natural childbirth nuts.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.433
Yeah, we didn't find out about
the daughter til years later.

21:51.018 --> 21:51.852
- Yeah, those dicks up

21:51.852 --> 21:53.854
at the Justice Department
don't understand the value

21:53.854 --> 21:55.981
of being current on anything.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.315
Hell, we'd always speak in Chinese

21:57.315 --> 21:59.109
if it was left up to them.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.360
She pop up on the grid.

22:01.319 --> 22:03.864
- No, the daughter's
never been to a doctor.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.365
Like I said, we didn't find out about her

22:05.365 --> 22:07.075
til we did the five-year followup.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.036
- How's that possible?

22:09.036 --> 22:10.412
Everybody goes to the doctor?

22:10.412 --> 22:11.955
Jesus.

22:11.955 --> 22:13.707
- The daughter did die recently.

22:13.707 --> 22:14.666
She was in a car crash.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.960
She was high at the time.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.295
There were several fatalities.

22:19.254 --> 22:20.797
- So why am I here?

22:20.797 --> 22:22.007
You know the routine.

22:22.007 --> 22:22.924
Cremate the body.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.719
- Yeah, that's the problem.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.971
We don't have a body to cremate.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.807
The daughter went missing.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.434
You're fucking kidding me!

22:32.434 --> 22:34.603
We spend millions of
dollars to keep these people

22:34.603 --> 22:37.355
in our programs so they see our dentists,

22:37.355 --> 22:39.983
our doctors, our people!

22:39.983 --> 22:41.443
That way they don't get out there

22:41.443 --> 22:42.819
and get a tissue sample somewhere

22:42.819 --> 22:45.072
without us knowing about it.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.657
And you lose the fucking body?

22:49.493 --> 22:52.662
- I do have two feds casing
the mother's house right now.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.331
- Congratulations, Sherlock.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.042
- Look, if anyone's gonna take the body,

22:57.042 --> 22:58.627
it'd be that mother.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.295
She was into all kinds of occult shit

23:00.295 --> 23:02.964
before she ever signed up for the program.

23:02.964 --> 23:05.926
- You seal this case,
'cause if you don't I will.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.845
And I'll start by eating
my way down the food chain.

23:08.845 --> 23:11.598
(dramatic music)

23:15.227 --> 23:19.064
- Question everything,
what the ancients knew,

23:19.940 --> 23:21.858
the afterlife and the transition state.

23:26.988 --> 23:30.659
(footsteps tapping)

23:30.659 --> 23:31.493
Doog!

23:33.120 --> 23:33.954
Dooger!

23:35.539 --> 23:36.957
Doog!

23:36.957 --> 23:39.167
- Treen, my princess!

23:39.167 --> 23:41.378
What's up with all the cloak and dagger?

23:42.295 --> 23:43.588
You got the jitters do ya?

23:45.048 --> 23:47.592
Say, you don't look so good.

23:47.592 --> 23:48.969
(Pertreena laughing)

23:48.969 --> 23:51.471
Well don't you worry, 'cause
the doctor's in the house.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.057
Treen?

23:55.600 --> 23:57.978
Uh-oh, what's wrong with
my little chatter box?

24:04.359 --> 24:07.028
- Do you remember the crash
up on the 47 a while back?

24:08.238 --> 24:11.741
- Yeah, something about a bunch
of cars and one got totaled.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.454
- That was my car.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.166
- Oh shit!

24:21.084 --> 24:24.629
I mean, considering as
good you look compared

24:24.629 --> 24:25.922
to those photos I seen?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.719
Wait, I think I remember something

24:30.719 --> 24:35.724
about the driver was dead,
then not dead, no missing.

24:37.475 --> 24:40.770
Why, what, came off a week-long bender

24:40.770 --> 24:42.772
and I can't remember anything right now.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.110
(dramatic music)

24:47.110 --> 24:48.570
You know ..., I do remember.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.448
She was dead and they lost her bo--

24:53.074 --> 24:55.118
(choir vocalizing)
(woman screaming)

24:55.118 --> 24:56.161
Holy, what!

24:56.161 --> 24:59.080
(Pertreena crying)

25:08.048 --> 25:08.882
No, what?

25:10.091 --> 25:10.926
You're freezing.

25:28.276 --> 25:29.110
Damn.

25:30.070 --> 25:30.946
- Damn.

25:30.946 --> 25:31.863
- [Doog] You mean?

25:33.782 --> 25:34.616
- Yeah.

25:36.326 --> 25:37.160
- Oh, my God.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.746
But how?

25:41.957 --> 25:46.461
(gentle music)
(Pertreena crying)

25:46.461 --> 25:50.924
Maybe it's just all those
years of doing coke, you know.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.468
(Pertreena laughs)

25:53.468 --> 25:57.597
Well, if anyone's gonna break
the rules it would be you.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.891
- I need to find my mom?

25:59.891 --> 26:01.351
- Who else knows?

26:01.351 --> 26:03.895
- No one, just an old
couple that found me.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.147
But they're not gonna say
anything I don't think.

26:06.147 --> 26:06.982
- Okay.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.443
Okay, well we need to think this through.

26:10.443 --> 26:11.278
I mean, you think your mom's really ready

26:11.278 --> 26:12.779
for something like this right now?

26:14.197 --> 26:16.199
- I don't know.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.909
I don't know, I don't really
know anything anymore.

26:17.909 --> 26:21.121
I just, I just want things
to be like they were.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.998
- Okay, let's just hang out with me

26:22.998 --> 26:25.250
until we get everything together, okay.

26:26.751 --> 26:29.212
Shit. (sighs)

26:34.426 --> 26:35.635
You look the same.

26:37.804 --> 26:38.888
Feel any different?

26:41.933 --> 26:42.767
Hm.

26:43.810 --> 26:44.894
Maybe this will help.

26:53.403 --> 26:56.489
(Pertreena sniffing)

26:57.574 --> 27:00.243
(Doog sniffing)

27:09.127 --> 27:09.961
Nothing?

27:12.088 --> 27:13.757
Don't that suck.

27:16.676 --> 27:19.888
(gentle music)

27:19.888 --> 27:23.308
- Tomorrow we'll go find my mom and Kelly

27:23.308 --> 27:24.893
and maybe they have Blizzard.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.063
- Yeah, okay.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.609
I got some runs to make too.

27:32.609 --> 27:35.278
(ominous music)

27:37.489 --> 27:42.285
♪ Ah, ah ♪

27:42.285 --> 27:44.037
♪ Ah ♪

27:46.915 --> 27:47.916
(dramatic music)

27:47.916 --> 27:51.836
(chanting in foreign language)

27:58.385 --> 28:01.221
(woman screaming)

28:11.272 --> 28:14.025
(dramatic music)

28:17.737 --> 28:20.657
(engine puttering)

28:23.535 --> 28:26.204
(ominous music)

28:27.455 --> 28:30.333
Franko, loco, how the hell have you been.

28:30.333 --> 28:31.209
- Let's do this, punk.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.002
- Whoa, whoa, okay, relax, here.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.130
- Better be good shit or
I'm comin' back for you.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.924
- That is the best shit.

28:37.924 --> 28:41.219
Unless you're Pertreena 'cause
it didn't do shit for her.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.471
- What the fuck did you just say?

28:44.347 --> 28:45.723
What the fuck did you just say?

28:45.723 --> 28:46.808
- I didn't say anything.

28:46.808 --> 28:47.642
I didn't say anything.

28:47.642 --> 28:49.436
- What the fuck, where's the body!

28:49.436 --> 28:51.271
- I didn't say shit, I don't know shit.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.939
- Where's the body!

28:52.939 --> 28:56.234
- [Doog] (coughing) I don't know.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.777
- You piece of shit.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.447
(Doog coughing)

29:03.158 --> 29:04.200
- But she ain't dead.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.621
(bright music)

29:08.621 --> 29:09.956
- What the fuck.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.419
(phone beeps)

29:14.419 --> 29:17.005
(phone ringing)

29:17.005 --> 29:18.089
It's DiCapri.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.134
I think I found the body.

29:21.134 --> 29:21.968
- Go on.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.012
- I don't know where it is.

29:24.012 --> 29:27.432
But I know someone who does.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.349
- When can we meet?

29:31.686 --> 29:33.313
- There's something else.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.106
Just gibberish.

29:35.106 --> 29:35.940
- Yes.

29:37.233 --> 29:40.069
- My source rambled on about
the body not being dead.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.030
But it was.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.240
Then it wasn't.

29:45.658 --> 29:48.203
Like I said, just gibberish.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.662
- Who else knows any of this?

29:50.747 --> 29:53.917
- No one, haven't had time
to call my partner yet.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.084
- Well don't.

29:55.084 --> 29:55.919
I'll take it from here.

29:55.919 --> 29:56.753
Where are you now?

30:07.055 --> 30:08.014
Okay.

30:08.014 --> 30:09.599
I'll send a car there right now.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.018
Your job is done.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.313
Thank you, agent, fine work.

30:16.397 --> 30:19.150
(dramatic music)

30:20.818 --> 30:23.321
(phone beeps)

30:24.781 --> 30:26.616
I got a lead on the body.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.409
Yeah, I'm checking the source right now.

30:29.869 --> 30:30.703
Yes.

30:31.788 --> 30:32.872
I understand.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.709
I'll sweep everything when I'm done.

30:41.005 --> 30:44.133
(tense driving music)

31:19.085 --> 31:21.838
(dramatic music)

31:26.884 --> 31:29.053
(door knocking)

31:29.053 --> 31:29.887
- Kel!

31:40.773 --> 31:42.609
Kelly, it's me, Treen!

31:45.945 --> 31:48.698
(door squeaking)

31:56.581 --> 31:57.415
Kelly?

31:59.584 --> 32:00.418
Kelly?

32:02.211 --> 32:03.129
Hiya, Bliz.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.299
No, Bliz, come here.

32:07.717 --> 32:08.551
No, it's mama.

32:08.551 --> 32:11.471
(Blizzard hissing)

32:18.061 --> 32:20.813
(dramatic music)

32:52.512 --> 32:53.554
- Jesus!

32:53.554 --> 32:56.516
(blow thuds)
(dramatic music)

33:06.275 --> 33:09.320
The Jacquem girl, she's not dead anymore.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.738
(animal growling)

33:10.738 --> 33:13.157
- Bob, I hate to wake you at this hour.

33:13.157 --> 33:15.201
- No problem, what is it, Charlie.

33:15.201 --> 33:16.828
That cellular re-gen program

33:16.828 --> 33:19.205
that Justice killed back in the '90s.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.416
- I always considered
that my greatest ambition

33:22.458 --> 33:24.377
and also my greatest failure.

33:24.377 --> 33:25.503
- It wasn't a failure.

33:27.630 --> 33:28.715
You near a computer?

33:28.715 --> 33:29.549
- Yeah.

33:30.967 --> 33:35.888
- Subject 27, Jacquem, Katherine H.

33:35.888 --> 33:37.140
25 at the time.

33:38.224 --> 33:43.229
Some free-spirited drug
abuser, Lord knows what else.

33:43.312 --> 33:44.480
- I see it.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.858
Zero response, just like the others.

33:49.902 --> 33:54.907
27, dropped off the grid, no
medical visits, no checkups.

33:54.907 --> 33:56.284
Went dark on us, eh.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.871
Yes, she was the one that was into

33:59.871 --> 34:03.249
all that naturopathic BS, right.

34:03.249 --> 34:04.041
A daughter?

34:07.086 --> 34:09.547
- [Charlie] Yeah, two years
after she quit the program.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.380
Keep reading.

34:12.049 --> 34:16.304
- Daughter, Pertreena Jacquem, age 23.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.348
Wait, I don't remember a daughter.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.684
- Yeah, born at home.

34:21.684 --> 34:23.268
I just learned that.

34:23.268 --> 34:24.103
Read on.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.485
- Car accident.

34:32.652 --> 34:34.697
Okay, so Charlie, what's this about?

34:34.697 --> 34:37.324
- [Charlie] Her body went
missing at the hospital.

34:37.324 --> 34:38.909
- Our cleaner, I assume.

34:39.994 --> 34:41.913
- We didn't snatch her.

34:41.913 --> 34:42.830
Bob, she came back.

34:44.998 --> 34:45.792
Bob!

34:48.418 --> 34:49.545
- As in--

34:49.545 --> 34:51.339
- As in she re-gened.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.882
Somehow her fucking body has re-gened.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.136
The whole town is looking for her.

34:57.136 --> 34:58.012
- No, not possible.

34:58.012 --> 34:59.722
It was the mother we treated.

34:59.722 --> 35:02.183
- Mom's drug history and
the treatment we gave her.

35:03.392 --> 35:05.103
Yeah, it's some random mutation.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.230
Hell, you're the world's leading expert.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.315
Figure out how to weaponize that mutation.

35:14.070 --> 35:14.862
- No.

35:17.406 --> 35:19.826
It's got to be something
else to get it to pass.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.623
(eerie music)

35:28.543 --> 35:30.628
(bell tolling)

35:30.628 --> 35:34.674
(woman whispering eerily)

35:34.674 --> 35:39.595
(bell ringing)
(evil laughing)

35:39.595 --> 35:42.265
(ominous music)

35:52.483 --> 35:55.194
(dramatic music)

35:58.489 --> 36:01.617
(gun clicking)

36:01.617 --> 36:02.827
(gun firing)

36:02.827 --> 36:03.870
(dramatic music)

36:03.870 --> 36:05.037
- Katherine Jacquem?

36:05.955 --> 36:06.789
- Yes.

36:06.789 --> 36:08.457
- I'm with the federal government.

36:09.625 --> 36:10.918
- What do you want?

36:10.918 --> 36:12.753
- I understand this
may be a troubling time

36:12.753 --> 36:13.963
for you right now.

36:13.963 --> 36:15.464
But has anyone contacted you

36:15.464 --> 36:18.009
with any information
regarding the whereabouts

36:18.009 --> 36:19.385
of your daughter's remains?

36:20.261 --> 36:21.304
- No.

36:21.304 --> 36:23.931
You see, I think that's rather hopeless.

36:23.931 --> 36:25.349
- I'm not sure I understand.

36:26.434 --> 36:29.020
- I believe my Treena
is in some special place

36:29.020 --> 36:32.523
and knowing her, she
decided to take her body.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.234
- You're coming with us.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.862
- No, I don't know anything.

36:37.862 --> 36:38.905
- You don't remember?

36:39.989 --> 36:41.657
The project.

36:41.657 --> 36:42.533
- The project?

36:42.533 --> 36:44.035
What is this?

36:44.035 --> 36:46.996
- We own you now, get in the fucking car.

36:46.996 --> 36:48.873
- No, now let me go.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.750
Leave me alone!

36:50.750 --> 36:51.584
Get off me!

36:51.584 --> 36:53.294
Where are you taking me?

36:53.294 --> 36:54.128
Stop!

36:55.630 --> 36:58.841
(dramatic music)

36:58.841 --> 37:00.468
- [Pertreena] Mom!

37:00.468 --> 37:03.137
(ominous music)

37:05.097 --> 37:06.515
- Oh my God, you're alive!

37:06.515 --> 37:08.017
- I love you, Mom, we have to go!

37:08.017 --> 37:10.478
We have to run, right now!

37:10.478 --> 37:11.896
- [Dispatch] All units in the vicinity

37:11.896 --> 37:15.691
of 6667 Jordan Avenue, a
home invasion in progress.

37:16.692 --> 37:21.697
(engine revving)
(alarm blaring)

37:24.784 --> 37:25.618
(siren wailing)

37:25.618 --> 37:26.702
- We better get out of here.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.832
- Oh my God, you're alive.

37:33.250 --> 37:34.961
I thought you were dead.

37:34.961 --> 37:38.297
- I know, I know.
- Oh my God.

37:38.297 --> 37:41.384
I saw on the news, I saw
your body fall to the ground.

37:41.384 --> 37:42.218
- I know, I don't know what's going on.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.011
I can't explain anything, I
don't know what's going on.

37:44.011 --> 37:45.388
But you have to go.

37:45.388 --> 37:46.931
You have to go, you can't
tell anyone you saw me here,

37:46.931 --> 37:49.225
okay, 'cause they're gonna hurt you.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.142
And I don't want them to hurt you.

37:50.142 --> 37:51.352
They won't hurt me, I promise you.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.186
I promise you.

37:52.186 --> 37:53.896
But they're gonna hurt
you so you need to go.

37:53.896 --> 37:55.564
Okay, please, don't tell
anyone tell anyone I was here.

37:55.564 --> 37:56.565
- Pertreena what's going
on, I don't understand.

37:56.565 --> 37:58.734
- Please, just trust me, okay.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.237
Do you trust me?
- Okay.

38:01.237 --> 38:02.780
I trust you, baby.
- I love you.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.115
- Be safe, okay, be safe.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.451
Go, I love you, I love you!

38:07.451 --> 38:10.037
(somber music)

38:11.080 --> 38:13.749
(siren wailing)

38:14.959 --> 38:17.670
(dog barking)

38:17.670 --> 38:20.089
(door thuds)

38:22.216 --> 38:23.509
- Ma'am, are you okay?

38:23.509 --> 38:24.969
- Yeah, I'm fine.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.637
My girl, she, uh.

38:26.637 --> 38:28.472
- Okay, what about your girl.

38:28.472 --> 38:31.017
- Nothing, these men showed up

38:31.017 --> 38:34.228
and I'm just a little confused right now.

38:34.228 --> 38:36.522
- Whoa, whoa, what about your daughter?

38:36.522 --> 38:37.690
- I'm really shaken up.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.443
- What a goddam hornet's nest.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.698
Activate Alpha Hush One.

38:45.698 --> 38:48.075
Yes, I'm sure, goddammit.

38:48.075 --> 38:49.326
Make it happen.

38:50.453 --> 38:51.829
Look, any word of this gets out

38:51.829 --> 38:54.498
and the whole world will
be in panicking mode.

38:54.498 --> 38:56.459
And find that damn girl!

38:57.460 --> 38:58.461
Let's go.

38:58.461 --> 38:59.670
- And what about your daughter.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.922
- I just, I'm a little shaken up.

39:04.425 --> 39:07.428
(crickets chirping)

39:09.013 --> 39:11.682
(ominous music)

39:12.975 --> 39:14.518
- Well, is there anything else?

39:15.436 --> 39:16.687
- No.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.564
I told you everything that happened.

39:18.564 --> 39:19.398
- Yeah.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.904
And still nothing on the whereabouts

39:24.904 --> 39:26.405
of your daughter's body.

39:30.951 --> 39:31.911
- No.
- Hm.

39:33.412 --> 39:34.538
That's odd.

39:36.082 --> 39:38.042
You don't know anything about that, hm?

39:39.376 --> 39:40.211
- No.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.382
- All right, well good night, ma'am.

39:50.513 --> 39:51.889
I'll be in touch again.

39:52.807 --> 39:55.393
(somber music)

40:00.022 --> 40:02.775
(door clicks)

40:02.775 --> 40:05.778
(crickets chirping)

40:12.118 --> 40:12.952
- Okay.

40:14.453 --> 40:15.579
Thank you for calling.

40:18.791 --> 40:21.460
- [Mr. Greenley] What is it, hon?

40:21.460 --> 40:25.297
- Frank DiCapri was shot
dead at his house tonight.

40:33.472 --> 40:36.475
(crickets chirping)

40:40.187 --> 40:42.773
(Doog moaning)

40:56.620 --> 40:57.454
- Hey.

40:58.372 --> 40:59.999
- Hey.

40:59.999 --> 41:00.833
- Where am I?

41:01.834 --> 41:02.710
- Your place.

41:03.794 --> 41:07.548
Found you in an alley and
managed to drag you back here.

41:08.591 --> 41:09.717
Thought for a minute you were jumping

41:09.717 --> 41:11.677
to the other side with me.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.095
(Doog laughs)

41:13.095 --> 41:14.930
- Too dark for me, princess.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.309
Think some guy tried to off me.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.478
They came looking for you.

41:23.480 --> 41:25.024
- What did he want?

41:25.024 --> 41:25.858
- You.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.655
He was definitely G.

41:32.656 --> 41:33.741
I mean, government.

41:36.202 --> 41:40.831
If you're on their grid,
you're fucked. (moans)

41:43.626 --> 41:45.628
- What are they gonna do, kill me?

41:45.628 --> 41:46.879
(both laughing)

41:46.879 --> 41:47.796
- Yeah.

41:50.883 --> 41:54.595
(sighs) No, but those around you.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.390
- Like my mom.

41:58.390 --> 42:00.976
(somber music)

42:02.978 --> 42:03.812
And you.

42:05.773 --> 42:06.607
- Yeah.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.444
- Doog, you need to warn my mom.

42:11.487 --> 42:12.655
Okay, she can't tell them anything

42:12.655 --> 42:17.243
as long as I'm around
she's not, she's not safe.

42:18.118 --> 42:18.953
- Okay.

42:20.913 --> 42:22.665
What about that boyfriend of yours?

42:23.874 --> 42:27.127
- (laughing) Oh, you mean before all this,

42:31.590 --> 42:34.510
we had a blowout the
night of the accident.

42:34.510 --> 42:35.552
- Mm.

42:35.552 --> 42:36.553
Does he know?
- No.

42:37.596 --> 42:42.601
No, no, I have to think
that through some more.

42:44.561 --> 42:45.396
- Right.

42:46.647 --> 42:47.898
- So what about the feds?

42:48.732 --> 42:51.777
- Hm, the feds are ugly ass people.

42:51.777 --> 42:52.736
(Pertreena laughing)

42:52.736 --> 42:54.321
I mean, they could try
to do experiments on you

42:54.321 --> 42:56.115
or try to find out what happened to you

42:56.115 --> 42:57.908
and do experiments on somebody else.

42:58.742 --> 43:00.286
I mean, that's their specialty.

43:00.286 --> 43:01.745
Find ways to do evil things.

43:04.164 --> 43:07.376
- This book says that long
ago, like ancient times,

43:07.376 --> 43:10.004
high priests knew shit before
science and everything.

43:11.922 --> 43:12.840
They said they could read things

43:12.840 --> 43:16.552
from the planets and stars and
animals, do you believe that?

43:16.552 --> 43:18.387
- Hell, yeah.

43:18.387 --> 43:19.305
I mean think about that big-ass wave

43:19.305 --> 43:21.181
that hit Japan a while back.

43:21.181 --> 43:22.433
Did the satellites know anything?

43:22.433 --> 43:23.726
No.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.352
Those earthquake gizmos?

43:25.352 --> 43:26.937
No.

43:26.937 --> 43:27.896
But the animals?

43:27.896 --> 43:29.898
A couple of hours before that wave came,

43:29.898 --> 43:31.567
they took high ground.

43:31.567 --> 43:32.901
They know shit.

43:32.901 --> 43:34.862
The people? (laughs)

43:34.862 --> 43:35.863
All wiped out.

43:38.907 --> 43:39.825
- So.

43:39.825 --> 43:42.745
- So, what I'm trying to say is someone

43:42.745 --> 43:45.372
or something probably knows how
to deal with your situation.

43:45.372 --> 43:46.999
(Pertreena laughs)

43:46.999 --> 43:49.918
I mean, maybe you're
supposed to be alive again.

43:49.918 --> 43:50.794
An actual way.

43:52.963 --> 43:53.797
Or maybe.

43:55.299 --> 43:57.384
♪ Ah, ah ♪

44:03.807 --> 44:05.017
- Dead in a natural way.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.771
- I'm just saying, if
you're looking for answers,

44:08.771 --> 44:11.315
you gotta be prepared for
what you're gonna find.

44:15.694 --> 44:18.405
- Well, it's gotta be better than this.

44:18.405 --> 44:21.075
(ominous music)

44:21.075 --> 44:21.909
Shit.

44:32.086 --> 44:32.920
- Hey.

44:33.879 --> 44:35.089
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.843
Any new developments in the Jacquem case?

44:40.969 --> 44:41.845
- No, not a thing.

44:44.223 --> 44:45.474
- Remember what I said.

44:46.433 --> 44:47.476
Don't let it eat you.

44:48.602 --> 44:50.938
- (scoffs) Hell, that's my job.

44:50.938 --> 44:51.980
You know that.

44:51.980 --> 44:54.441
I mean, nobody wants an
unsolved case on their record.

44:54.441 --> 44:56.110
Especially one like that.

44:56.110 --> 44:58.237
People expect justice.

44:58.237 --> 44:59.780
- But you get to the point sometimes

44:59.780 --> 45:00.906
that you shut me out.

45:04.368 --> 45:05.869
- Well, what do you want me to do?

45:05.869 --> 45:08.622
Huh, do you want me to
just clock out at work

45:08.622 --> 45:11.417
and say sorry people, I wish
I could find out who did this

45:11.417 --> 45:13.585
but my wife's got dinner
waiting for me at home, huh.

45:13.585 --> 45:14.711
- Of course not.

45:16.004 --> 45:17.214
Of course not, but I need time too.

45:17.214 --> 45:20.300
And this past week has been
like a morgue around here.

45:20.300 --> 45:22.594
- Oh (laughs) really.

45:24.179 --> 45:25.556
- I'm sorry.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.266
(somber music)

45:27.266 --> 45:29.059
But this case is getting to me too.

45:29.059 --> 45:30.310
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

45:32.020 --> 45:35.065
- Look, all I'm saying is,
is find time for me, okay.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.651
Find time for me too.

45:37.651 --> 45:39.695
- [Chief] Mm-hm, I'll see you tonight.

45:39.695 --> 45:40.529
- But.

45:41.864 --> 45:44.074
Okay, well, when will you be home.

45:44.074 --> 45:44.908
- I don't know.

45:51.373 --> 45:53.041
- Charlie.
- Bob.

45:53.041 --> 45:56.170
This is Thomson Duffy,
part of my covert team.

45:56.170 --> 45:58.005
- So, where are we?

45:58.005 --> 46:02.342
- Katherine Jacquem,
subject 27, project Draugr.

46:02.342 --> 46:03.177
- Draugr?

46:04.136 --> 46:08.557
- It's Norse mythology, means
literally, again-walker.

46:11.935 --> 46:14.605
- As I was saying, subject 27,

46:14.605 --> 46:17.065
gave birth to a Pertreena Jacquem

46:17.065 --> 46:19.234
two years after Justice
killed the program.

46:20.319 --> 46:23.655
Katherine was a alternate
in the outlier pool.

46:25.824 --> 46:27.910
Heavy into drug and alcohol uses,

46:27.910 --> 46:29.995
and heavy into the occult practices.

46:31.163 --> 46:34.416
We decided to use her just in
case some of the interaction

46:34.416 --> 46:37.878
with the treatment was different
than the standard subjects.

46:37.878 --> 46:39.630
And if she died in the process.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.757
- Just another drug OD case.

46:42.799 --> 46:44.635
- Case, yeah, exactly.

46:44.635 --> 46:47.387
- So what kind of occult activities?

46:47.387 --> 46:51.767
I mean, bloodletting, blood
drinking, fringe stuff?

46:51.767 --> 46:53.101
- Well, it's unknown at this time.

46:53.101 --> 46:55.812
But it's best not to rule anything out.

46:55.812 --> 46:57.940
- It is possible, if she engaged

46:57.940 --> 46:59.858
in ritualistic blood drinking

46:59.858 --> 47:02.819
that some pathogens may have altered

47:02.819 --> 47:04.071
her own blood chemistry.

47:04.988 --> 47:06.156
The daughter?

47:06.156 --> 47:09.076
- Pertreena, she was
killed in a car pileup.

47:09.076 --> 47:11.036
Her body went missing the same night.

47:12.246 --> 47:16.333
Approximately a week later,
she'd been spotted, alive.

47:19.378 --> 47:20.295
That's all for now.

47:21.296 --> 47:22.130
- But wait.

47:30.514 --> 47:31.932
- We good with this guy?

47:31.932 --> 47:33.600
- He'll know what I want him to know.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.102
I'll need him for later uses.

47:35.978 --> 47:38.272
- Well, we need to secure the
body as quickly as possible

47:38.272 --> 47:40.357
to prevent any tissue contamination.

47:40.357 --> 47:41.692
- I've sealed the program.

47:41.692 --> 47:44.695
Nothing to DOD and not a
goddam thing to Justice.

47:44.695 --> 47:47.698
Just you, me, Duffy and a couple
of trigger men, that's it.

47:48.824 --> 47:51.994
- Okay, we're going to
need to isolate her,

47:51.994 --> 47:55.289
sample her DNA,
reconstitute it in the lab.

47:55.289 --> 47:58.875
I'll need tox and structural
integrity analysis

47:58.875 --> 48:00.502
of all of her organs separately.

48:00.502 --> 48:02.129
- Okay, okay, okay.

48:02.129 --> 48:04.089
I'll let you take care of those details.

48:04.089 --> 48:06.216
I just need to deliver
a weaponized version

48:06.216 --> 48:09.052
of the regeneration projects
once you replicated it.

48:09.052 --> 48:10.804
How long is it going to take?

48:10.804 --> 48:13.890
- Well, we'll need to run each
one through a tissue sampler

48:13.890 --> 48:16.184
and then a 3D tissue printer

48:16.184 --> 48:18.353
to give us a supply to experiment with.

48:19.229 --> 48:21.523
- How do you expect to
replicate her organs.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.235
- We'll cut them out of her body.

48:27.112 --> 48:29.323
Come on Joe, a little DOD.

48:29.323 --> 48:32.576
(tense music)

48:32.576 --> 48:33.410
- Fuck.

48:34.369 --> 48:35.454
Battery must be dying.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.290
- Your computer's busted.

48:38.290 --> 48:39.124
- What?

48:39.124 --> 48:39.958
What are you talking about?

48:39.958 --> 48:42.127
- Screen keeps popping out
and oh wait, it's back.

48:42.127 --> 48:43.378
Hm.
(Doog laughs)

48:43.378 --> 48:46.173
- Must be NSA's way of
saying, good morning.

48:46.173 --> 48:47.049
- (laughs) Right.

48:48.216 --> 48:49.885
- Look, you can stay as long as you want.

48:49.885 --> 48:51.178
Leota may be coming by later, though.

48:51.178 --> 48:53.388
- Oh, I just need a few
seconds to look for something.

48:53.388 --> 48:55.057
Be gone by the time you get back.

48:55.057 --> 48:57.768
I wouldn't want to get
between you and your squeeze.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.144
- (laughs) Well, I'd be okay with that

48:59.144 --> 49:00.604
as long as you two are.

49:00.604 --> 49:01.772
- Perv.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.440
- What would they call that?

49:03.440 --> 49:06.443
A menage a trois. (laughs)

49:06.443 --> 49:07.903
Hey, I'm just kidding.

49:07.903 --> 49:09.029
Loosen up.

49:09.029 --> 49:11.740
(somber music)

49:11.740 --> 49:12.574
Are you okay?

49:14.576 --> 49:16.370
- No, I'm not okay, I'm scared.

49:18.413 --> 49:19.706
How long am I supposed to be like this.

49:19.706 --> 49:21.083
Where am I supposed to go?

49:21.083 --> 49:22.793
What am I gonna do, what am I
supposed to do, I don't know!

49:22.793 --> 49:23.919
- Hey, hey, hey.

49:23.919 --> 49:24.836
Come on now.

49:24.836 --> 49:25.671
Come on now.

49:28.965 --> 49:31.843
What happened to that fuck
the world girl I always loved.

49:34.012 --> 49:35.555
- She died.

49:39.309 --> 49:40.227
She died.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.817
(somber music)

49:48.318 --> 49:51.488
Life after death, tissue regeneration.

49:53.407 --> 49:55.075
(sighs) Cryogenics.

49:58.412 --> 50:03.000
Dr. Cassandra Peola, Dr. Cassandra Peola,

50:03.000 --> 50:06.503
leading researcher in
cellular reconstruction.

50:07.379 --> 50:09.339
Board certified medical doctor.

50:13.552 --> 50:17.013
737 East, that's, that's
shit, that's here in town.

50:18.306 --> 50:21.560
(dramatic music)

50:21.560 --> 50:22.394
- Are we in?

50:26.314 --> 50:27.899
- Yes, sir, we are in.

50:40.537 --> 50:42.622
- Cross link with all targets I gave you.

50:43.582 --> 50:44.708
- Yes, sir.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.460
Known drug contacts.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.920
Social contacts, past girlfriends.

50:48.920 --> 50:51.673
You're six levels deep on
his social networking, sir.

50:51.673 --> 50:52.966
- I want to know
everything there is to know

50:52.966 --> 50:54.259
about this scumbag.

50:55.177 --> 50:57.471
All right, I want to know who he knows,

50:57.471 --> 51:00.599
who knows him, who he thinks he knows.

51:00.599 --> 51:02.601
If he's had a wet dream about a model,

51:02.601 --> 51:04.144
I want to know who she is

51:04.144 --> 51:05.103
and what kind of panties she's wearing

51:05.103 --> 51:06.438
in a dream, you understand?

51:08.440 --> 51:10.984
- (laughs) Yes, sir.

51:11.943 --> 51:14.696
(dramatic music)

51:17.407 --> 51:18.450
- [Corky] What's up, bro, hey.

51:18.450 --> 51:20.952
- You got all the fuckin' money this time?

51:20.952 --> 51:21.787
- Yeah, dude.

51:23.914 --> 51:25.373
- You ever fuckin' stiff me again,

51:25.373 --> 51:27.459
I'm gonna get Taz's goons
after your little bitch-ass.

51:27.459 --> 51:28.960
- What the fuck, count it dude.

51:28.960 --> 51:30.921
- Taz doesn't like it
when I come up short.

51:30.921 --> 51:31.880
- Dude, fuckin' count it.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.089
It's all there, dude.
- Mm-hm.

51:33.089 --> 51:36.301
Like I said--
- What the--

51:36.301 --> 51:39.554
- If you ever fuckin' stiff me again,

51:39.554 --> 51:41.306
oh there's gonna be peace.

51:41.306 --> 51:43.892
A piece of you here and
a piece of you there.

51:43.892 --> 51:45.018
- What'd I do?
- You fuckin' understand me?

51:45.018 --> 51:46.436
- What the fuck, dude, chill bro.

51:46.436 --> 51:48.230
Come on dude, fuck. (sighs)
- Fuck.

51:50.941 --> 51:54.110
(train bell clanging)

51:57.072 --> 51:59.282
(bell tolling)

51:59.282 --> 52:03.370
(whispering in foreign language)

52:04.496 --> 52:07.082
(dramatic music)

52:07.082 --> 52:11.461
(singing in foreign language)

52:11.461 --> 52:13.964
(tense music)

52:43.451 --> 52:45.954
- No, no, no, no, no!

52:45.954 --> 52:46.746
Fuck!

52:48.331 --> 52:51.334
- You understand why I gave
you this clearance level?

52:51.334 --> 52:53.169
This is a sealed operation.

52:53.169 --> 52:55.922
You fuck up, you're
disavowed, on your own.

52:55.922 --> 52:58.133
- [Sam] Yes, I understand.

52:58.133 --> 52:59.551
- You wanted in this department.

52:59.551 --> 53:01.052
I need to know who I can trust.

53:01.052 --> 53:02.178
- [Sam] No, I want in.

53:02.178 --> 53:03.763
You can count on me.

53:03.763 --> 53:05.557
- Okay, write this down.

53:06.766 --> 53:07.976
- Katherine Jacquem, hm.

53:09.811 --> 53:12.230
6667 Jordan Avenue.

53:13.398 --> 53:15.317
Yeah, I understand.

53:16.693 --> 53:19.446
(dramatic music)

53:23.909 --> 53:26.202
- Thank you, for seeing me, Monsignor.

53:27.078 --> 53:29.539
- I sense there's trouble
in your voice, Michael.

53:32.959 --> 53:35.629
- Yesterday, for my blood checkup,

53:35.629 --> 53:37.464
I was asked about my father.

53:39.257 --> 53:41.051
I never knew my father.

53:41.051 --> 53:41.885
- I know.

53:43.970 --> 53:45.764
- How could you know that?

53:45.764 --> 53:47.432
- I don't know how you're
gonna take this, Michael.

53:47.432 --> 53:50.393
But you've been troubled
for several weeks now.

53:50.393 --> 53:52.896
Perhaps now is the time.

53:52.896 --> 53:54.397
- Monsignor?

53:54.397 --> 53:56.483
- Michael, what's your first recollection?

53:59.152 --> 54:03.365
- Probably, five or so.

54:04.866 --> 54:07.202
Playing with my mother down at the lake.

54:08.745 --> 54:10.372
- That was your adopted mother.

54:11.706 --> 54:13.124
- What are you talking about?

54:20.674 --> 54:23.885
- You were born into our
orphanage, here in the parish.

54:25.053 --> 54:27.639
(somber music)

54:29.140 --> 54:31.393
This is your birth mother.

54:32.936 --> 54:34.646
Friends knew her as Agnes.

54:34.646 --> 54:37.190
Of course, the church never
revealed her real name.

54:40.151 --> 54:41.403
- I don't understand.

54:41.403 --> 54:44.280
- Agnes was, how should I put it,

54:45.448 --> 54:47.575
a lady who was familiar with men.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.037
- How do you mean?

54:53.206 --> 54:54.582
- She was a prostitute.

54:56.751 --> 54:57.669
When she became pregnant,

54:57.669 --> 54:59.879
she asked if the church would take you in.

55:02.048 --> 55:03.508
The night of your birth, she was walking

55:03.508 --> 55:04.759
through the town square

55:05.760 --> 55:09.055
and suddenly she went into
labor, rather unexpected.

55:09.889 --> 55:12.559
She collapsed near the
town's monument bell.

55:12.559 --> 55:15.145
Some people called for emergency services,

55:15.145 --> 55:17.647
but she was too far along in labor.

55:17.647 --> 55:18.732
She gave birth to you,

55:19.607 --> 55:24.237
(laughs) right there,
right in town square.

55:25.655 --> 55:26.990
- How's that funny?

55:28.992 --> 55:31.661
- I think the news clipping's right here.

55:33.204 --> 55:35.415
They said you came into
the world announced.

55:38.668 --> 55:42.005
- Newborn rings town bell
to announce he's here.

55:43.965 --> 55:48.678
- When your mother fell to
the ground while giving birth,

55:48.678 --> 55:51.514
she clutched the town's monument.

55:51.514 --> 55:53.767
In so doing, she struck the bell

55:53.767 --> 55:56.019
just as you decided to
enter into the world.

55:57.812 --> 56:00.982
It was table talk for several weeks.

56:01.858 --> 56:06.863
(bell ringing)
(dramatic music)

56:08.948 --> 56:10.283
(dog barking)

56:10.283 --> 56:11.701
(Pertreena growling)

56:11.701 --> 56:13.119
(body thuds)
(dog whimpering)

56:17.707 --> 56:18.541
- Hey.

56:22.212 --> 56:23.129
Got the taste, huh?

56:25.131 --> 56:27.759
Why don't you come down
here, do each other a favor.

56:29.761 --> 56:32.514
(birds chirping)

56:36.476 --> 56:38.978
Hey girlie, that was my lunch.

56:38.978 --> 56:40.271
That's gonna cost ya.

56:42.023 --> 56:45.568
(Pertreena growling)

56:45.568 --> 56:47.821
You bitch, you bit me you freak!

56:50.323 --> 56:53.368
(Pertreena growling)

56:53.368 --> 56:56.037
(body crashing)

56:58.164 --> 57:00.667
(Pertreena sighing)

57:00.667 --> 57:03.253
(horn beeping)

57:08.591 --> 57:11.177
(upbeat music)

57:13.930 --> 57:16.683
- Treen, how's my lady of the dark?

57:19.811 --> 57:22.105
What the hell's on your face,
what the fuck's going on?

57:22.105 --> 57:24.858
- Get me a drink!
- Okay, okay.

57:24.858 --> 57:25.692
Just relax.

57:28.778 --> 57:30.071
Where the hell did you go?

57:31.990 --> 57:36.286
- Um, I found a doctor and
I think she can help me.

57:36.578 --> 57:39.455
- What the fuck is a doc.

57:42.458 --> 57:43.293
What the fuck is a doctor supposed--

57:43.293 --> 57:45.628
- Well then who's gonna help me then?

57:45.628 --> 57:47.255
- I don't know!

57:47.255 --> 57:49.299
- I can't do this anymore!

57:51.259 --> 57:52.844
I can't do this anymore.

57:52.844 --> 57:54.512
I need someone to help me!

57:54.512 --> 57:56.514
I need to fix it!

57:56.514 --> 57:57.849
One way or the other.

57:57.849 --> 58:00.351
- But princess, whatever the
fuck has happened to you,

58:00.351 --> 58:01.936
goes way beyond anything a doctor can do.

58:01.936 --> 58:03.605
- Well then what?

58:03.605 --> 58:04.856
- I don't know!

58:08.359 --> 58:10.904
I'm just saying, there's
got to be another way.

58:10.904 --> 58:12.447
That's all I'm saying.

58:14.073 --> 58:15.241
- Please, what.

58:15.241 --> 58:16.451
- Treen.

58:16.451 --> 58:17.243
- What.

58:17.243 --> 58:18.494
- Treena, princess?

58:19.913 --> 58:23.166
Treen, Treena!

58:23.166 --> 58:24.584
Treena, princess, princess!

58:32.634 --> 58:33.509
- Yes?

58:33.509 --> 58:36.304
- Sam Knight, DiCapri's replacement.

58:36.304 --> 58:38.056
Read through the file on the Jacquem case.

58:38.890 --> 58:40.516
- Yes.

58:40.516 --> 58:42.894
- Thought we'd get another
statement from the mother.

58:42.894 --> 58:45.271
- I already took her statement.

58:45.271 --> 58:46.689
Agent DiCapri and I went

58:46.689 --> 58:48.691
to her house the night of the accident.

58:48.691 --> 58:50.068
It's all on file.

58:50.068 --> 58:51.361
- I know.

58:51.361 --> 58:53.321
I just thought some time had passed.

58:53.321 --> 58:54.822
Maybe she remembered something.

58:54.822 --> 58:57.825
Something where we could find the body.

58:57.825 --> 59:02.455
- Look, you just transferred
in from the D.C. unit.

59:02.455 --> 59:03.539
Have I got that right?

59:04.374 --> 59:05.583
- Actually from Langley.

59:06.876 --> 59:08.544
- Right, Langley.

59:09.420 --> 59:11.297
Military background?

59:11.297 --> 59:14.050
- Middle East six years, special ops.

59:14.050 --> 59:17.178
Finished my tour and took
a desk job at Langley.

59:17.178 --> 59:19.430
- Military intel.

59:19.430 --> 59:20.265
- Yeah.

59:21.724 --> 59:24.435
- Then why in the hell
were you assigned to me?

59:24.435 --> 59:25.270
- The truth?

59:27.647 --> 59:30.316
Don't you think a body going
missing in a small town

59:30.316 --> 59:31.859
after a major accident,

59:31.859 --> 59:34.112
with all the police and all the news,

59:34.112 --> 59:37.115
a body going missing right
under everyone's noses,

59:37.115 --> 59:38.241
come on Agent Greenly.

59:40.576 --> 59:43.830
Your partner was killed,
you needed a replacement.

59:43.830 --> 59:46.499
- Someone from military intel?

59:46.499 --> 59:47.542
- Division head got the call

59:47.542 --> 59:49.043
to put another set of eyes on the case.

59:49.043 --> 59:52.255
Someone with... specialized training.

59:52.255 --> 59:54.465
Felt it was warranted at this point.

59:54.465 --> 59:55.967
- At this point?

59:55.967 --> 59:58.469
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

59:58.469 --> 59:59.929
- Look, frankly, Agent,
you've had this case

59:59.929 --> 01:00:02.223
in your lap long enough, don't you think.

01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:04.183
Time for the big boys to take over, hm.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:11.274
For the record, Agent Greenley,
you were assigned to me.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:15.737
(dramatic music)

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:22.327
We'll swing by the mother's place again.

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.328
Yeah, I know.

01:00:24.495 --> 01:00:26.080
I'll get something out of her.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.332
I will find the daughter.

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:29.792
No, Greenley won't be a problem.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.794
Besides we need her for now.

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:34.756
No, this has to look like
a typical FBI handshake

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:35.590
with local PD.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.387
(door knocking)

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:47.060
- Christ, I'm coming!
(door banging)

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:49.604
I said, I'm coming!

01:00:50.563 --> 01:00:52.565
What, what, what!
- Dooger!

01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:53.691
Dooger, Dooger, no!

01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.401
Don't touch me, no!
- Come on, let's go.

01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:56.235
- No, get away!
- Let's go.

01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:57.403
- Get the fuck off her!
- Let go of me, now.

01:00:57.403 --> 01:01:00.323
I don't I want to go.
- Get the fuck off me!

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:01.908
- No, no!
- Get off.

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.952
Get the fuck off her.

01:01:04.952 --> 01:01:06.579
(Pertreena screaming)

01:01:06.579 --> 01:01:07.997
- [Pertreena] Let go of me!

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.165
- Fuck you too!

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:11.084
Uh huh, fuck, fuck you!

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:13.836
- Shut the fuck up.
- I said fuck you.

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.213
- [Thug] Shut up!

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:16.672
- Fuck you!

01:01:16.672 --> 01:01:19.217
Fuck you!
(gun firing)

01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:20.968
(dramatic music)

01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:23.429
- Take his computer and any drives.

01:01:23.429 --> 01:01:26.682
(electricity sizzling)

01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:30.019
- My 30 year experiment
has come home.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.109
- A young girl.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:39.904
- Oh, she is so much more than that.

01:01:40.988 --> 01:01:43.908
(machines beeping)

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.378
- That's not possible.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:58.131
- I decide what's possible and what's not.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.842
We need to isolate the
regenerative process

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:02.844
for each of her organs separately.

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:04.804
We can start that tonight.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:07.348
We have the mother's DNA chart,

01:02:07.348 --> 01:02:09.142
we'll get the daughter's right away.

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:13.438
Okay, let's light her up.

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.284
- Who are you, who are you,
where am I, where am I!

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:27.118
Help!
- Now, now,

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.911
- Where am I?
- Sh, sh.

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:29.871
- Let me go, let me go!

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.289
Please let me go!

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:32.415
Who are you, who are you?

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:33.749
No!
- Tonight is the night

01:02:33.749 --> 01:02:35.334
you make history.
- Please.

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:36.419
What are you talking about?

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:38.129
You're crazy.
- For me.

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:39.422
- Let me go!

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.966
Let me go, please help me, please.

01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:42.800
Please no!

01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:45.052
No!
- Ah, there.

01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:48.514
Much better.
(Pertreena whimpering)

01:02:48.514 --> 01:02:50.391
Now, where is my music ?

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:58.191
(blaring rock music)

01:02:58.191 --> 01:02:59.025
Better.

01:02:59.984 --> 01:03:03.946
I'm going to go down in
medical annals you know.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:08.951
The man who defied death and
created life out of nothing.

01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:13.414
(Pertreena screaming)

01:03:13.414 --> 01:03:15.333
The one man in all of history

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:21.297
who dared defy God himself.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:26.636

You got some crazy shit going on up here.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:29.532
- Yeah, yeah, I don't understand.

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:30.366
What.

01:04:31.492 --> 01:04:34.829
- You kind of passed out at the bar.

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:36.122
And we came back here but.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:41.252
- What is that?

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:43.671
- It's nothing, it's nothing.

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:46.799
- Dooger, Dooger what happened.

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:47.675
Dooger, you need to tell me what happened!

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:48.551
- Okay, okay.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:49.719
- You need to tell me if I did something.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.596
What happened when I passed out!

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:53.306
- Okay.

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:54.557
- What happened?

01:04:55.808 --> 01:04:56.684
- It was probably just an accident.

01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:57.852
- No, it wasn't!

01:04:57.852 --> 01:04:58.894
- Dammit, okay.

01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:00.730
You bit me.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.064
You fuckin' bit me.

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:03.733
You chewed on my arm.

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.735
- Oh no.
- You happy!

01:05:06.944 --> 01:05:09.071
You attacked me like
some wild fucking dog!

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:13.367
(Pertreena gasping)

01:05:13.367 --> 01:05:14.452
But it's okay.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.830
It's not a big deal.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:22.668
Treen.

01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:25.338
It's not a big deal.

(gentle music)

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:29.050
It was probably just a bad drunk.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.635
It happens to all of us.

01:05:31.969 --> 01:05:33.220
It's all right.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:37.141
- Dooger, I need you to kill me.

01:05:37.141 --> 01:05:40.519
No, I'm serious, look at me!

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:43.439
I need you to kill me, okay.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:44.440
I can't do this anymore.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.067
I don't care, I don't care how you do it

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:48.069
but you have to make it last, okay!

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:50.905
I just, cut off my fucking head.

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:53.574
Or chop me into pieces
or stab me in the heart

01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:56.744
with a wooden stake but
I can't do this anymore.

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:59.413
I can't be this monster!

01:05:59.413 --> 01:06:00.247
- Silver.

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:03.417
You meant silver, you said wooden.

01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:05.378
- What are you?

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.171
- You meant silver, you said wooden.

01:06:08.422 --> 01:06:10.049
You're gonna need silver.

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.509
- [Pertreena] What are you talking about?

01:06:11.509 --> 01:06:14.804
- You would need something
silver to kill the undead.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:15.638
Come on, Treen.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.223
You watch the same movies as me.

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:18.599
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:20.059
I didn't mean to ask you to do that.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:22.353
- Sh, sh, sh, sh.
- I didn't.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.315
You have always been there for me.

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:28.317
I'm serious, no, I can never repay you

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:29.902
for everything you've done.

01:06:29.902 --> 01:06:31.237
- So what, I saw you cheat drugs.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.988
- [Pertreena] I'm not, I'm serious.

01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:36.367
- Okay, then if you ever make it,

01:06:36.367 --> 01:06:40.496
ever really make it to the
other side, put in a good word.

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:42.498
Put in a good word for good Old Doog.

01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:48.462
Tell 'em, that fella down
there had trouble stealing.

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:51.173
- And lying.

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.007
- And lying.

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:53.008
And bad habits.

01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:56.095
- And selling drugs to schoolkids.

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:57.888
- And that too.

01:06:57.888 --> 01:06:59.890
- And I don't think you ever paid taxes.

01:07:00.933 --> 01:07:03.978
- No. (laughs)

01:07:07.314 --> 01:07:08.399
It's a hell of a list.

01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:09.817
Maybe you should go now.

01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:13.446
You know, and get everything
ready for my judgment day.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.198
Yeah.

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:17.450
Let's do it.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.118
Let's cut your fucking head off.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:21.704
(gentle music)

01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:28.586
(engine puttering)

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:37.178
- Chief.
- Genny, Blake.

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:40.264
- Chief, got family coming in town again?

01:07:40.264 --> 01:07:42.850
- No, I'm not here for a room.

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:45.186
- Well, what can we help you with.

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:47.480
- You remember the night of that accident.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.439
- Up on 47?

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:50.566
- Yeah, up on 47.

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:52.359
There was quite a lot
of commotion that night.

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:55.988
Probably a lot of cars
passing by your place.

01:07:55.988 --> 01:07:58.115
- Yeah, lots of traffic.

01:07:58.115 --> 01:07:59.950
- Right, yeah, lots of traffic.

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:02.912
Do either of you remember anything else

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.747
since we took your report?

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:07.500
- Like we told the officers
that night of the accident,

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:11.754
nothing out of the ordinary,
other than the traffic.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:14.048
Mostly those reporters we figured.

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:19.136
- It was a pretty quiet night, that night.

01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:21.555
- That night?

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:25.184
- Is this still about the missing girl?

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:28.187
- You mean the missing body?

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:31.774
- Yeah, we mean the missing body.

01:08:32.983 --> 01:08:34.359
Is that what this is about?

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:42.243
Say, Chief, it's kind of
a long shot, I suppose.

01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:45.246
But that medical research
facility down at Cutler County,

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:47.331
you know, the one that used

01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:49.291
to pick up stray dogs for experiments?

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:50.792
- Yep.

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:52.586
- You ever get that place shut down?

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:56.756
- Oh the photos of
those poor dead animals.

01:08:57.675 --> 01:09:01.428
- Blake, Genny, good night.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:06.350
(engine puttering)
(dramatic music)

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:19.279
(bell tolling)

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.948
(phone ringing)

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.287
- Father DiSantis.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:29.247
Yes.

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:31.000
Good morning.

01:09:34.252 --> 01:09:35.129
I see.

01:09:37.715 --> 01:09:41.051
Yes, I'm sure it's been traumatic for her.

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:43.595
It's been traumatic for everyone.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:46.348
(dramatic music)

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:48.434
I could get Father Mays to visit with her.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.981
Well, I appreciate the kind words.

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:57.318
But I think Father Mays
would be better suited

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:58.360
for the situation.

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:01.447
Besides, my schedule.

01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:06.452
I understand.

01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:09.163
Yes.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:11.999
All right.

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:14.001
I'll visit with her.

01:10:18.672 --> 01:10:19.506
Thank you, Kelly.

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:25.930
And Kelly, let's keep this
call between us for now.

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:29.850
Have a good day.

01:10:38.692 --> 01:10:40.861
(phone ringing)
(bright music)

01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:41.820
- Dabney.

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.821
- Charlie?

01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:45.032
Bob, where are we?

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:46.116
- Well we got Duffy running a trace

01:10:46.116 --> 01:10:47.534
on everybody connected with her.

01:10:47.534 --> 01:10:49.620
- I pulled up the DNA
readout on the mother,

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.665
looking for a transmission model, nothing.

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.918
I need the daughter's organs.

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.754
Frankly, there is no physical
mechanism to explain it.

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:01.215
It has to be something
with the daughter herself.

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:04.259
- You're worried about
tissue contamination?

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:07.054
- This is a one in a million freak event.

01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:09.264
We are way beyond any tradition biology

01:11:09.264 --> 01:11:10.349
that I can understand.

01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:14.395
There's something else going on here.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:17.147
(birds chirping)

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:22.861
(dramatic music)
(bell tolling)

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:28.367
(door squeaking)

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:29.493
(dog barking)

01:11:29.493 --> 01:11:30.327
- Katherine.

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:32.830
(dog howling)

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:39.712
- (laughs) Sorry if I can't
live up to your standards.

01:11:40.587 --> 01:11:44.008
No wait, what is it they say
in that holy place of yours?

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:47.469
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.096
It has been, oh, I don't know,

01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:53.142
a fucking eternity since my
last confession. (laughs)

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.977
- Katherine, don't.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.562
- Do you want some?

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:57.396
Oh, no, that's right.

01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:59.106
You only drink wine.

01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:00.149
It is wine, isn't it.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.692
But it turns into something else.

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:04.737
Hm, and you thought my
rituals were strange.

01:12:05.904 --> 01:12:08.657
(dramatic music)

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.495
- I would like a glass.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:17.374
It's been a rather trying day for me too.

01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:18.208
- Hm.

01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:21.545
- All those miracles we have
to do at Mass every day.

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:25.966
It really wears on you.

01:12:25.966 --> 01:12:29.928
- Oh. (sighs)

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:31.680
Okay.

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:33.682
- See uh...

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:41.690
We're all human.

01:12:46.653 --> 01:12:47.488
- Cheers.

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.824
Why are you really here, Michael?

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:57.956
- When I heard about Pertreena,
I was just devastated.

01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:01.085
Overwhelmed.

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:02.669
- By pain? (scoffs)

01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:04.713
I know that, yeah.

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:07.049
- Pain, guilt.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:09.468
- It's a little late to
feel any guilt, isn't it?

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:14.223
- Does a person ever truly
get rid of the guilt?

01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:16.350
- I don't know, you tell me.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:18.185
You're in the forgiveness business.

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:20.187
- Forgiveness,

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:24.066
doesn't always erase guilt.

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:31.448
- You've had more than 20 years.

01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:35.869
- Stop.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:39.456
You know why I made the decision I did.

01:13:40.624 --> 01:13:42.501
- Michael. (crying)

01:13:46.046 --> 01:13:48.215
I know we loved each other.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:49.633
I know that much.

01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:53.512
I know we loved each other, didn't we?

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:54.513
- Katherine.

01:13:56.181 --> 01:13:58.642
People change, we were young.

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:01.395
Different people back then.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:02.729
- Yeah, different people,
of course, of course.

01:14:02.729 --> 01:14:03.772
That's right, yeah.

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:05.983
- I was facing so many things at the time.

01:14:08.652 --> 01:14:10.112
So many things.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.073
- Life is full of challenges.

01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:15.826
Isn't that what your Good
Book preaches, Michael?

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:17.953
- [Michael] Stop it, stop it.

01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:24.668
(sighs) I came to ask
if you'd heard anything.

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:30.841
You know, about who may
have taken Pertreena's body.

01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:35.095
- I don't know where she is.

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:37.931
I mean, I don't know where.

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:43.353
I don't where her body is.

01:14:43.353 --> 01:14:48.025
- When Pertreena's found,
please, please, Katherine.

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:53.113
Call me, she'll need a proper service.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:55.782
- No, no.

01:14:55.782 --> 01:14:59.828
I'll handle things by
myself, like I always have.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:03.373
(dramatic music)

01:15:03.373 --> 01:15:05.751
- So what else do you
know about this Dr. Peola?

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:10.505
- I mean, she specializes

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:13.675
in some kind of cell or cellular thing.

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:16.220
I don't really understand
it but she's here in town.

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:20.057
- So, you went to see her
without an appointment.

01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:22.351
- I went to office, some guy showed up.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.811
They had a gun, they went in her office.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:27.898
Did you find her on the internet?

01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:31.026
Shit, Treen.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:35.197
That means they have my house
tapped and my phone! (sighs)

01:15:37.824 --> 01:15:41.036
I stole this one but fuck.

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:43.580
- Look, maybe you could
go visit her for me.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:44.790
- Now?

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:45.624
It's late.

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:46.708
- What day is it.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:47.584
- [Doog] Thursday.

01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:49.753
- Her site says she keeps evening hours,

01:15:49.753 --> 01:15:51.922
Thursdays and Fridays, we could go now.

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:52.881
(horns blaring)

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:53.799
Doog, Doog.

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:01.974
Dooger? (laughs)

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:06.019
You do want that good word
put in for you, right?

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:09.481
- Hell.

01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:12.859
Can't stay here much longer anyway.

01:16:12.859 --> 01:16:15.362
(dramatic music)

01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:16.738
- [Pertreena] That's her office.

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:17.572
- [Doog] Are you sure about this?

01:16:17.572 --> 01:16:19.241
- Doog, she has to try, I have to try.

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.201
Okay, if she can help me figure this out.

01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:22.035
- [Doog] Okay, okay.

01:16:22.035 --> 01:16:22.953
I'll talk to her.

01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:30.210
Run, tell Corky and I'll find ya.

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:31.420
I'll stop 'em, go!

01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:36.091
(dramatic music)

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.759
- [Duffy] Go after her, dammit.

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:38.594
Where's she going?

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:39.970
- [Doog] Who, I'm alone.

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:41.888
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:16:41.888 --> 01:16:43.724
Where is she going?

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:47.102
- [Doog] I don't know
who you're talking about.

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:47.936
Fuck!

01:16:49.479 --> 01:16:51.398
- I'm done playing games.

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:53.692
Where is she going.

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:54.526
- [Doog] Man, one of your friends

01:16:54.526 --> 01:16:55.360
probably hired her downtown.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.236
Go find her down there.

01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:58.989
- What the fuck are you
talkin' about, asshole?

01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:00.824
- [Doog] She's a fuckin' hooker.

01:17:00.824 --> 01:17:03.535
Go downtown to Valencia
or something and find her.

01:17:05.829 --> 01:17:06.747
- She got away.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.876
- We're not the type of guys
that you want to mess with.

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:11.960
- I can see that already.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.920
You're breath's fuckin' kickin'.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:18.467
(blows thudding)
(dramatic music)

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:21.219
(sirens wailing)

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:24.890
- Nice work.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.850
Take him down to the hole.

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:28.018
I'll call the landlord.

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:36.276
(mystical music)

01:17:36.276 --> 01:17:37.110
- Katherine.

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:38.320
- Something has happened.

01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:40.697
- I was expecting you sooner.

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.034
After I saw Treena's photo in the paper.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:47.412
- Treena is back.

01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:49.998
- Did we ever talk about
the history of Bell's End?

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:53.210
Quite amazing actually.

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.670
One of the earliest settlements.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.463
There was a tragic event one day.

01:17:57.422 --> 01:17:58.673
Not just any day.

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:04.638
You see, the town was
experiencing a plague.

01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:09.393
(chanting in foreign language)

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:13.939
The local healer, someone of our way,

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:15.440
had performed the ritual

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.734
to protect the town from the plague.

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:22.697
The night was September,
September the 22nd.

01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:25.742
- [Katherine] The autumn equinox.

01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:26.576
(wolf howling)

01:18:26.576 --> 01:18:28.370
- When day and night are of equal length,

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:31.415
perfect balance, perfect harmony.

01:18:31.415 --> 01:18:33.458
They blamed the plague on her.

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:35.752
She had a lover you see.

01:18:35.752 --> 01:18:38.422
But because of his position in the town,

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:40.757
he dare not reveal their forbidden affair.

01:18:41.633 --> 01:18:44.761
As they tormented her, he looked on,

01:18:44.761 --> 01:18:46.888
cowering in the shadows.

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:49.141
They had beaten her to the ground.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:52.352
But as she fell, her hand swung sideways,

01:18:52.352 --> 01:18:54.604
striking the monument's iron bell.

01:18:54.604 --> 01:18:59.067
It seemed to carry her dying
words across the night sky.

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:00.986
- I curse the blood of any child

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:04.156
that is born within the
tolling of this bell.

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:06.741
(bell tolling)

01:19:08.493 --> 01:19:11.371
- [Beulah] And with that curse, she died.

01:19:11.371 --> 01:19:14.040
(ominous music)

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:18.336
(thunder cracking)

01:19:21.715 --> 01:19:24.384
(ominous music)

01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:41.693
(chanting in a foreign language)

01:19:41.693 --> 01:19:44.279
(fire booming)

01:19:45.822 --> 01:19:49.743
(chanting in foreign language)

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:11.389
(somber music)

01:20:18.104 --> 01:20:19.981
- Has anyone seen Father DiSantis?

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:22.400
- No, Monsignor.

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:27.948
(bell tolling)

01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:34.287
(water splashing)

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:37.249
(woman growling)

01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:38.583
- What!

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:39.960
What do you want with me!

01:20:41.044 --> 01:20:41.920
- Oh.
- Wakin' up.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:42.879
Look at this.
- I told you what I know.

01:20:42.879 --> 01:20:44.422
- Nap time's over, fuck face.

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:45.632
Time for class.

01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:49.427
Lesson number one, honesty
is the best policy.

01:20:49.427 --> 01:20:53.306
(blow thuds)
(Doog groans)

01:20:53.306 --> 01:20:54.724
Did he tell us what he knew?

01:20:55.809 --> 01:20:56.643
Did you get anything from him.

01:20:56.643 --> 01:21:00.230
- I fuckin' said
everything, fuck! (groaning)

01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:02.732
(dramatic music)

01:21:02.732 --> 01:21:03.525
(Doog screaming)

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.735
- Oh yeah. (laughing)

01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:07.821
- [Doog] Help!

01:21:09.155 --> 01:21:10.824
- I'll ask you again,
where's the fuckin' girl.

01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:12.534
- Okay, okay, wait!

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:13.368
Wait!

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:17.163
(drill whirring)

01:21:17.163 --> 01:21:18.873
- So lesson number two, fuck face.

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:23.128
Velocity plus force equals pain.

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:29.718
- Okay, okay.

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:32.971
No, ow, no!

01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:33.805
No!

01:21:34.806 --> 01:21:36.224
- [Woman] Dammit!

01:21:39.769 --> 01:21:42.564
- I'll take it.
- No, enough.

01:21:43.523 --> 01:21:45.150
Shit.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:46.067
- [Thug] We're not getting anywhere.

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:47.777
- This fuckin' guy is useless.

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:50.447
Damn.

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:52.574
Look, we better call the landlord.

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.034
- All right.

01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:56.703
(ominous music)

01:22:00.498 --> 01:22:01.750
(door tapping)
- Coming.

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:06.046
(dramatic music)

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.135
What the fuck.

01:22:12.135 --> 01:22:13.386
What the fuck do you want?

01:22:13.386 --> 01:22:16.348
- That scumbag dealer of yours.

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:17.849
- Fuckin' who, Dooger?

01:22:17.849 --> 01:22:19.267
- [Duffy] Yeah, fuck face.

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:20.644
Where's he hiding the girl?

01:22:20.644 --> 01:22:22.812
- What the fuck are you talkin' about.

01:22:22.812 --> 01:22:24.022
Where the fuck is he.

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:25.565
- Don't worry about him.

01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:27.150
Where's the girl?

01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:28.610
- What girl?

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:29.444
Leota?

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:31.112
- Who the hell is Leota?

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:31.988
- It's his fuckin' lady, man.

01:22:31.988 --> 01:22:35.575
- [Duffy] No, asshole, the other girl.

01:22:35.575 --> 01:22:37.577
- I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

01:22:37.577 --> 01:22:38.411
- [Duffy] All right.

01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:40.080
- Leota's his only fuckin' girlfriend.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.831
- You're getting us no where.

01:22:41.831 --> 01:22:42.666
Where is she?

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:46.294
- I don't know his fuckin'
buyers and who he sells too.

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.796
You'd fuckin' have to ask him.

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:50.340
- She's a buyer?

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.802
- Who the fuck are you guys talkin' about?

01:22:55.929 --> 01:22:57.681
- Where getting no where with this guy.

01:22:57.681 --> 01:23:00.100
- Look, am I being busted?

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:05.438
- [Duffy] Busted, you think we give a shit

01:23:05.438 --> 01:23:07.857
about your pathetic ass.

01:23:07.857 --> 01:23:08.692
- Then deal with fuckin' Dooger man,

01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:09.859
'cause I don't have the faintest idea

01:23:09.859 --> 01:23:11.569
what the fuck you're talkin' about.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:17.283
(Corky groaning)

01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:23.123
- We got eyes on you, dirt bag.

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:25.333
- Fuck you.

01:23:28.628 --> 01:23:31.631
(upbeat music)

01:23:31.631 --> 01:23:32.882
Can you put Taz on the phone?

01:23:34.926 --> 01:23:38.722
It's Corky, shit face, put him
on the goddam fuckin' phone.

01:23:40.890 --> 01:23:41.766
- What, asshole.

01:23:43.226 --> 01:23:46.604
- Taz, they took Dooger.

01:23:46.604 --> 01:23:48.440
- What are you jabbering about?

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.400
- [Corky] The feds, man.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.193
They grabbed Doog.

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:53.903
- So he got busted.

01:23:53.903 --> 01:23:55.905
He's been busted before.

01:23:55.905 --> 01:23:56.906
It's part of doing business.

01:23:56.906 --> 01:23:58.324
So what?

01:23:58.324 --> 01:24:00.493
He'll be out in what, three days.

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:04.456
- They came to my house and
tried to fuckin' kill me.

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:05.957
This isn't about drugs, man.

01:24:05.957 --> 01:24:06.791
They're not DEA.

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:09.210
They just kept asking

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:10.962
about some girl fucking Doog was hiding.

01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:12.672
- What girl?

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.300
- I have no fuckin' idea.

01:24:16.259 --> 01:24:19.179
They must be CIA or NSA or something.

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:22.307
They thought I knew something about it.

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:23.433
- Okay, okay.

01:24:23.433 --> 01:24:24.267
Calm down.

01:24:25.185 --> 01:24:26.186
Where's he at now?

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:30.398
(people chattering)

01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:43.703
Pull the car up.

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:50.001
Grab a firecracker.

01:24:52.128 --> 01:24:54.881
(crowd cheering)

01:24:57.509 --> 01:24:58.927
Fuckin' feds man.

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:04.891
- I need help, I need your help.

01:25:04.891 --> 01:25:05.725
I need your help.

01:25:05.725 --> 01:25:07.185
- You, what is it?

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:10.563
- They found out about me
and they tried to take my mom

01:25:10.563 --> 01:25:13.441
and me and they have Dooger,
they have my friend Dooger.

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:14.275
- Of course.

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.402
- They took him.
- Of course.

01:25:16.402 --> 01:25:18.613
(door squeaking)
(gentle music)

01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:31.167
- Now you stay here til
things get figured out.

01:25:33.711 --> 01:25:35.255
- These fuckin' feds man.

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:38.675
They're nothin' but a
goddam thorn in my side.

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:41.845
Remember when they shut down the Palace?

01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:45.223
- Just a business man, boss.

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:46.724
- Damn fuckin' right I am.

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:53.314
- [Corky] He's inside.

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:55.775
- Okay, get out of here.

01:25:55.775 --> 01:25:57.360
My guys will take care of this.

01:26:04.367 --> 01:26:05.451
We should be good.

01:26:06.452 --> 01:26:08.997
It's a fuckin' waste land around here.

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:12.542
As soon as you spot
Dooger, shoot anybody else.

01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:15.587
I've got an early dinner appointment.

01:26:17.046 --> 01:26:19.507
(tense music)

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:40.987
Dooger, move!

01:26:40.987 --> 01:26:45.742
(guns popping)
(people groaning)

01:26:45.742 --> 01:26:47.660
- [Woman] Fuckin' shit.

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:53.166
Shit.

01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:02.133
Shit.

01:27:05.511 --> 01:27:06.554
- Shit, man.

01:27:07.764 --> 01:27:10.183
You look worse than that
hooker that shorted me.

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:13.019
What the fuck is this about?

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.063
They're not DEA.

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.149
- I don't know.

01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:19.317
Let's ask this bitch.

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:24.155
(woman moaning)

01:27:24.155 --> 01:27:25.823
- [Bald Thug] Speak.

01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:26.658
- Fuck you!

01:27:27.784 --> 01:27:29.786
- [Bald Thug] (laughing) Fuck me?

01:27:31.829 --> 01:27:32.664
You hear that?

01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:36.709
Fuck me.

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:40.964
- Yeah. (laughing)

01:27:40.964 --> 01:27:42.674
Fuck you.

01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:45.385
- [Bald Thug] Again with the fuck you.

01:27:45.385 --> 01:27:46.344
Who you after?

01:27:48.888 --> 01:27:50.014
- Kiss my ass.

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:56.604
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:03.861
Looks like school's out for you, bitch.

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:11.286
(guns firing)

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:26.092
(phone ringing)

01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:28.845
- Dabney.

01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:30.138
- He's gone.

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:30.972
- Come again?

01:28:32.223 --> 01:28:35.435
- The dealer, someone
must have come for him.

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:36.519
Both our guys are dead.

01:28:36.519 --> 01:28:37.520
- Shit, wait outside.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.771
I'm gonna send a cleaner.

01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:42.817
- You sure about this.

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:46.070
- Yeah, I can't go back to my place.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:48.781
- I could put you up at the Palace

01:28:48.781 --> 01:28:50.700
until you find a place to stay.

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:51.701
- No, this is cool.

01:28:52.618 --> 01:28:53.995
I don't think they'll look for me here.

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:56.122
But I'm gonna need a place soon.

01:29:03.254 --> 01:29:05.006
- The boys will find you something.

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:07.550
- Thanks, Taz.

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.019
I owe you my life.

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:23.983
- (laughs) Of course you do.

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.324
- There was no one at the front desk

01:29:31.324 --> 01:29:33.785
so I, I really need a room.

01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:36.287
- You look more in need
of a doctor than a room.

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:39.874
- I was mugged the other day.

01:29:41.918 --> 01:29:43.294
- Hm.

01:29:43.294 --> 01:29:45.004
How many nights?

01:29:45.004 --> 01:29:48.841
- Um, just, uh--

01:29:48.841 --> 01:29:50.802
- How many nights?

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:51.844
- A couple, I guess.

01:29:53.429 --> 01:29:54.263
Um?

01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:57.683
- [Blake] Yes?

01:29:57.683 --> 01:29:59.685
- I'm waiting for a friend.

01:29:59.685 --> 01:30:00.520
- A friend?

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.688
- Yeah, a friend.

01:30:02.688 --> 01:30:04.232
Has anyone checked in recently?

01:30:05.775 --> 01:30:07.443
- This is a hotel.

01:30:07.443 --> 01:30:09.695
People check in every day.

01:30:09.695 --> 01:30:11.114
- Yeah.

01:30:11.114 --> 01:30:11.948
A hotel.

01:30:13.699 --> 01:30:16.202
- Now won't you tell me
what this is really about?

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.163
- I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm tired

01:30:19.163 --> 01:30:21.082
and I need a place to stay, please.

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:21.958
- [Blake] A name?

01:30:23.626 --> 01:30:25.253
- I'm paying with cash.

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.546
- Still need a name.

01:30:30.383 --> 01:30:32.593
- Finley, Burton Finley.

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:36.556
- Right.

01:30:36.556 --> 01:30:38.349
One single room.

01:30:38.349 --> 01:30:39.809
Burton Finley is it?

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:47.233
That wouldn't be Burton
Dooger Finley, would it?

01:30:48.776 --> 01:30:51.362
(gentle music)

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:05.835
- [Pertreena] Oh my God, you're okay!

01:31:05.835 --> 01:31:07.461
Oh my God, oh my God.

01:31:07.461 --> 01:31:09.172
I thought they killed you.

01:31:09.172 --> 01:31:11.465
- I'm here, princess, I'm here.

01:31:13.217 --> 01:31:16.470
No offense, but I'm staying on this side.

01:31:18.389 --> 01:31:20.141
I'm here, princess, I'm here.

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:25.897
(Pertreena laughing)

01:31:27.523 --> 01:31:28.357
- This is Dooger.

01:31:30.067 --> 01:31:30.902
- So what now?

01:31:32.361 --> 01:31:34.197
- Doog, I need to find my mom, okay.

01:31:34.197 --> 01:31:35.031
See if she's okay.

01:31:35.031 --> 01:31:36.741
And maybe she knows how to fix everything.

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:38.868
- What about the doctor?

01:31:38.868 --> 01:31:39.869
- There's no way we're
getting anywhere near her,

01:31:39.869 --> 01:31:42.872
okay, but my mom, she'll
know what to do, okay.

01:31:42.872 --> 01:31:44.415
Ever since I was a little girl,

01:31:44.415 --> 01:31:46.584
she's always figured things out.

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:51.672
- Look, princess, I don't
think her spells can help

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:52.506
with this one.

01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:56.928
Cast into the whole black magic,

01:31:56.928 --> 01:32:00.848
rituals, spells, salt circles.

01:32:01.974 --> 01:32:02.892
- So what then?

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:05.353
Stay like this forever?

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:09.398
Always waiting for me to attack everyone

01:32:09.398 --> 01:32:10.399
and for the government to find everyone

01:32:10.399 --> 01:32:12.693
that knows me and kill them.

01:32:12.693 --> 01:32:14.028
Is that the better option?

01:32:15.988 --> 01:32:17.531
- We'll take you to your mom.

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:19.742
Couldn't hurt at this point.

01:32:20.952 --> 01:32:24.121
Forget about getting
anywhere near that doctor.

01:32:24.121 --> 01:32:26.916
Besides, I think your
mother's worried about you.

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:31.796
(Genny whispering)

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:32.630
Yeah.

01:32:35.424 --> 01:32:37.093
Let's give her a call and see

01:32:37.093 --> 01:32:39.595
if we can meet her somewhere
away from her house.

01:32:39.595 --> 01:32:40.429
- Thank you.

01:32:42.515 --> 01:32:43.349
- Yeah.

01:32:45.977 --> 01:32:49.230
I'm sure those assholes
have that place cased.

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:53.526
Sorry.
(Genny laughs)

01:32:53.526 --> 01:32:54.694
It's been a long day.

01:32:58.531 --> 01:33:01.826
- We hit a roadblock, pick
up the mother tonight.

01:33:01.826 --> 01:33:04.287
(tense music)

01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:13.004
- Whoa!

01:33:13.004 --> 01:33:13.838
Must be the cleaner.

01:33:15.715 --> 01:33:16.841
- Which way?

01:33:16.841 --> 01:33:18.467
- [Duffy] Up right through there.

01:33:24.223 --> 01:33:25.558
- These gloves never fit.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.602
Just the two?

01:33:28.602 --> 01:33:29.645
- Yeah, just the two.

01:33:31.522 --> 01:33:32.815
Do you have your piece?

01:33:32.815 --> 01:33:33.816
- [Duffy] Um, yeah.

01:33:35.526 --> 01:33:36.944
- Let me check it for you.

01:33:38.612 --> 01:33:39.447
(gung clicks)

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:40.948
Hm.

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:43.701
(gun firing)

01:33:43.701 --> 01:33:45.411
I count three.

01:33:45.411 --> 01:33:47.830
(gun firing)

01:33:49.665 --> 01:33:52.168
(tense music)

01:33:58.924 --> 01:33:59.759
It's done.

01:34:02.928 --> 01:34:05.431
(phone beeps)

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:10.770
(gun firing)

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:12.730
- Mrs. Jacquem, Agent Knight.

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:14.148
You remember Agent Greenley.

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:15.649
- It's late, what is it?

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:18.194
- May we come in?

01:34:18.194 --> 01:34:19.487
- Like I said, it's late.

01:34:21.238 --> 01:34:22.073
- Ms. Jacquem.

01:34:22.073 --> 01:34:23.532
- [Sam] Can we help you, officer?

01:34:23.532 --> 01:34:24.367
- Chief.

01:34:25.701 --> 01:34:26.952
- Can we help you, Chief?

01:34:28.788 --> 01:34:32.166
- Yes, I need a few minutes
alone with Ms. Jacquem.

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:33.042
- Chief.

01:34:34.126 --> 01:34:35.044
- Redding.

01:34:35.044 --> 01:34:38.089
- Chief Redding.
- Yeah.

01:34:38.089 --> 01:34:39.423
- I'm afraid jurisdiction's been passed

01:34:39.423 --> 01:34:41.384
to Agent Greenley and me at this point.

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:44.053
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

01:34:46.472 --> 01:34:48.599
- Well, son, I don't know
who gave you that idea.

01:34:48.599 --> 01:34:51.018
This is an inter-agency investigation.

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:56.440
- We can come back.

01:34:57.692 --> 01:34:58.526
- Yeah.

01:34:59.902 --> 01:35:01.570
I suppose you're right.

01:35:01.570 --> 01:35:02.405
Ma'am.

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:07.535
(crickets chirping)

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.912
(dog barking)

01:35:09.912 --> 01:35:11.831
- Well, Ms. Jacquem, if
I could just have you--

01:35:11.831 --> 01:35:13.958
- As I told them, it's late.

01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:15.376
- I know.
- Go home, Chief.

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:16.585
- [Chief] But this won't,
this won't take but--

01:35:16.585 --> 01:35:17.420
- Good night.

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:20.131
- All right, ma'am.

01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:28.347
(phone ringing)

01:35:28.347 --> 01:35:29.181
- Hello?

01:35:30.599 --> 01:35:31.392
Yes.

01:35:32.351 --> 01:35:34.478
(dramatic music)

01:35:34.478 --> 01:35:35.312
Oh, yes.

01:35:36.814 --> 01:35:37.648
I understand.

01:35:40.359 --> 01:35:41.444
I'll bring everything.

01:35:43.195 --> 01:35:44.947
Thank you!

01:35:47.783 --> 01:35:50.286
(tense music)

01:35:54.623 --> 01:35:55.458
- Well?

01:35:57.751 --> 01:36:00.212
- Old Forester Road, one hour.

01:36:00.212 --> 01:36:03.007
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:03.841
You're gonna see, Doog,

01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:05.509
everything's gonna be like it was before.

01:36:06.343 --> 01:36:07.511
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:36:12.683 --> 01:36:15.269
(somber music)

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:19.482
(crickets chirping)

01:36:20.399 --> 01:36:22.026
Mom!
- Easy!

01:36:22.026 --> 01:36:23.944
- Are you there!
- Easy!

01:36:25.362 --> 01:36:28.115
Let's make sure we weren't followed.

01:36:37.249 --> 01:36:39.460
- [Blake] Well, looks like we're alone.

01:36:41.587 --> 01:36:43.088
- Mom, Mom!
- Baby!

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:46.717
(Pertreena crying)

01:36:46.717 --> 01:36:47.593
It's okay.

01:36:47.593 --> 01:36:50.346
- Are you okay, you okay,
I thought they hurt you.

01:36:50.346 --> 01:36:51.222
- [Katherine] Sh, sh.

01:36:51.222 --> 01:36:52.973
- [Pertreena] I thought they'd kill you.

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:53.933
- [Katherine] Sh, sh.

01:36:53.933 --> 01:36:55.351
- [Pertreena] I thought they killed you.

01:36:55.351 --> 01:36:56.685
- Sh, it's okay.

01:36:58.020 --> 01:36:59.605
Oh no, look at you.

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:03.526
You saw me, we're safe.

01:37:03.526 --> 01:37:04.568
- You're safe.

01:37:04.568 --> 01:37:08.030
Mom, these are the people that
found me after the accident.

01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:09.823
- Thank you so much for
protecting my daughter.

01:37:09.823 --> 01:37:11.075
Thank you so much.

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:12.576
- Quite a surprise for us.

01:37:12.576 --> 01:37:15.037
- For all of us, believe me.

01:37:15.037 --> 01:37:16.038
Oh my goodness.

01:37:16.038 --> 01:37:17.748
- Mom, Mom, Dooger, he and
I had tried to find a doctor

01:37:17.748 --> 01:37:19.583
that can help but there's no
way we were gonna get near her.

01:37:19.583 --> 01:37:21.210
Okay, we're, people are trying to kill us.

01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:23.128
- The feds have our house staked down.

01:37:23.128 --> 01:37:24.463
- The feds, oh my God.

01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:27.550
Yeah, well, this trouble began.

01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:30.302
- What?

01:37:30.302 --> 01:37:33.556
- No, nothing, baby, it
was before you were born.

01:37:33.556 --> 01:37:35.057
It's a long story.

01:37:36.267 --> 01:37:38.852
- We're all scratching our heads here.

01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:41.480
Your daughter thought that
perhaps you could help.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:44.316
But honestly, I have some doubts.

01:37:45.317 --> 01:37:46.735
Now I have a doctor friend who I can--

01:37:46.735 --> 01:37:47.570
- No!

01:37:49.071 --> 01:37:50.239
No more doctors, okay.

01:37:50.239 --> 01:37:51.407
- Sh.

01:37:51.407 --> 01:37:55.077
- What did you always tell
me since I was little.

01:37:55.077 --> 01:37:58.372
- Acceptance is more
powerful than understanding.

01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:00.040
Just because you don't
understand something

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.001
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

01:38:02.001 --> 01:38:04.503
But, this is different, Treena.

01:38:05.504 --> 01:38:06.338
I don't what you've done.

01:38:06.338 --> 01:38:09.258
- No, you've always had
a spell for everything.

01:38:12.136 --> 01:38:14.096
- Most of those were for other things.

01:38:14.096 --> 01:38:16.890
Treena, good weather, a safe trip.

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:19.268
- No, no, you always had a spell for me!

01:38:19.268 --> 01:38:20.769
I remember.

01:38:20.769 --> 01:38:21.937
Ask her how many times I've been sick,

01:38:21.937 --> 01:38:23.981
even when I was little, ask her.

01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:26.650
- Not even the measles or a cold?

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:32.990
- This is nothing like that, Treena.

01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:34.199
- This is everything like that.

01:38:34.199 --> 01:38:35.117
This is more.

01:38:35.117 --> 01:38:38.912
- I'm with, I'm with
princess, Mrs. J., I mean,

01:38:39.913 --> 01:38:41.332
even if we could get her to the doctor,

01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:43.042
what would those assholes
know what to do anyway?

01:38:43.042 --> 01:38:45.836
- Yeah, what would those assholes know

01:38:45.836 --> 01:38:48.255
about what's happened to her?

01:38:49.214 --> 01:38:50.924
- [Pertreena] Please.

01:38:50.924 --> 01:38:51.884
- [Genny] You said it yourself,

01:38:51.884 --> 01:38:55.304
we're not meant to understand everything.

01:38:57.306 --> 01:38:58.140
- Mom?

01:38:59.391 --> 01:39:00.809
- Let me think.

01:39:00.809 --> 01:39:02.561
Dooger, can you get my bag, please.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:06.523
- This is gonna be great,
it's gonna be fine.

01:39:06.523 --> 01:39:13.238
- Treena, listen, Beulah,
years ago there was a spell

01:39:13.656 --> 01:39:18.369
but, Beulah is my, our Clan's matriarch,

01:39:18.369 --> 01:39:20.371
she's wise in nature's ways.

01:39:21.872 --> 01:39:22.998
I don't know.

01:39:24.416 --> 01:39:25.250
- Yes, you do, yes, you do.

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:26.710
Yes, you do, Mommy.

01:39:26.710 --> 01:39:28.754
- There is a spell but we
can't use that because, well--

01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:30.005
- Yes, we can.

01:39:30.005 --> 01:39:35.010
- Well it's a spell, it's
the path for lost souls.

01:39:35.511 --> 01:39:37.221
- That's me, that's me,
I'm a lost soul, Mom.

01:39:37.221 --> 01:39:38.597
I'm a lost soul!
- No, no, don't say that.

01:39:38.597 --> 01:39:41.350
Don't say that.
- I'm a lost soul.

01:39:42.184 --> 01:39:43.018
- Baby.

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:49.566
The spell is to return
a lost soul back home.

01:39:53.278 --> 01:39:54.697
- Well that's it.

01:39:56.573 --> 01:39:59.702
That's gonna be my second chance, Mom.

01:39:59.702 --> 01:40:02.454
I want to go back to school
and I'm gonna quit drugs.

01:40:03.706 --> 01:40:05.165
'Cause I'm gonna help you with the shop

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:07.334
and thank you, thank you, Mom.

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:10.713
- You mean back home?
- I knew you could help.

01:40:10.713 --> 01:40:11.964
- [Doog] As in?

01:40:13.048 --> 01:40:15.801
(dramatic music)

01:40:16.969 --> 01:40:19.680
- Mom, you're scaring me.
- Back home.

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:20.639
- Mom.
- It's back home

01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:21.849
as in to rest.

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:23.058
It won't work

01:40:23.058 --> 01:40:24.852
- No, no, princess, no, no!

01:40:26.979 --> 01:40:30.482
- Dear, you know you could
always stay with Blake and me.

01:40:30.482 --> 01:40:33.235
The police never stop by.

01:40:33.235 --> 01:40:35.028
You'll be safe there.

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:39.658
- I'm so sorry, sweetheart, listen to me.

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:43.287
We can't use that spell.

01:40:44.621 --> 01:40:46.290
The path is one way.

01:40:48.375 --> 01:40:50.961
Nature only moves forward--

01:40:50.961 --> 01:40:53.630
- No, it's done, it's done.
- No.

01:40:54.506 --> 01:40:56.717
- I can't do this anymore.

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:58.343
You're right, nature only moves one way

01:40:58.343 --> 01:41:02.681
and it called for me once
before and I didn't go.

01:41:02.681 --> 01:41:04.183
- What are you saying?

01:41:04.183 --> 01:41:05.851
What are you saying?

01:41:07.102 --> 01:41:10.314
- [Pertreena] I'm saying, it's
time for me to be at rest.

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:13.233
- No.
- Yes, please, Mom.

01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:16.236
You're right, please.
- No, stop it!

01:41:17.404 --> 01:41:20.240
- As long as I'm around, no one is safe.

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.742
I don't want to be like this.

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:23.327
I want to die.

01:41:23.327 --> 01:41:25.204
I want to die.

01:41:25.204 --> 01:41:26.789
- You don't know what you're asking.

01:41:26.789 --> 01:41:27.998
- Mom, if you love me you have to--

01:41:27.998 --> 01:41:28.999
- I won't do this.

01:41:28.999 --> 01:41:29.958
- Do you love me, Mom?

01:41:29.958 --> 01:41:31.210
Do you love me?

01:41:32.377 --> 01:41:33.253
- I do.

01:41:33.253 --> 01:41:34.129
- [Pertreena] Then you have to.

01:41:34.129 --> 01:41:35.005
You have to help me.

01:41:35.005 --> 01:41:35.964
I don't want to do this anymore.

01:41:35.964 --> 01:41:37.382
- Treen!
- Please listen.

01:41:37.382 --> 01:41:42.387
- Princess, you can't do this.

01:41:42.971 --> 01:41:43.889
- He's right, dear.

01:41:43.889 --> 01:41:45.766
Stay with Blake and me.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.851
- No.

01:41:49.144 --> 01:41:49.978
She's right.

01:41:50.979 --> 01:41:51.897
Listen to her.

01:41:51.897 --> 01:41:53.023
Think about her.

01:41:54.483 --> 01:41:59.154
If this keeps on, where can she go?

01:41:59.154 --> 01:42:00.280
Who can she be around?

01:42:02.491 --> 01:42:03.659
Is that any kind of life,

01:42:03.659 --> 01:42:06.495
never knowing who's hiding
around the next corner

01:42:06.495 --> 01:42:08.247
or who's life she puts in danger?

01:42:13.544 --> 01:42:14.795
- Please, please, Mommy.
- No.

01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:18.757
- I can never know what's
in your heart right now.

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:23.470
Genny and I never had children of our own.

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:26.682
But we've sheltered countless numbers

01:42:26.682 --> 01:42:28.809
of children over the years.

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:30.894
All of them lost souls of sorts.

01:42:32.396 --> 01:42:33.522
Not like this.

01:42:35.566 --> 01:42:38.443
But, there always comes a
time when you have to let go.

01:42:39.736 --> 01:42:43.240
- [Genny] Nature is bigger than any of us.

01:42:48.412 --> 01:42:49.830
- Please help me.

01:42:51.582 --> 01:42:53.750
- Okay, I love you.
- Okay.

01:42:55.210 --> 01:42:57.796
(somber music)

01:42:59.923 --> 01:43:02.509
(wolf howling)
(Thunder)

01:43:03.802 --> 01:43:07.681
(chanting in foreign language)

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:18.775
(speaking in foreign language)

01:43:20.235 --> 01:43:23.155
(thunder crashing)

01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:25.449
- I can't do this.
- No, Mom, Mom, you have to.

01:43:25.449 --> 01:43:26.283
Please.

01:43:29.202 --> 01:43:31.204
- Baby, no.
- I love you.

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:36.835
(knife plunging)
(Katherine groaning)

01:43:40.631 --> 01:43:43.550
(Katherine crying)

01:43:46.136 --> 01:43:48.639
- Oh my God, what have I done.

01:43:48.639 --> 01:43:52.476
(singing in foreign language)

01:44:01.443 --> 01:44:02.277
My baby.

01:44:04.029 --> 01:44:06.782
What have I done. (sobbing)

01:44:06.782 --> 01:44:09.368
(somber music)

01:44:28.345 --> 01:44:29.346
(bell tolling)

01:44:29.346 --> 01:44:31.264
- [Healer] I curse the blood of any child.

01:44:34.059 --> 01:44:35.852
- So does this put an end to it?

01:44:37.145 --> 01:44:38.021
- I assume they'd give us a call if--

01:44:38.021 --> 01:44:41.525
- Yes, Ms. Jacquem,
this puts an end to it.

01:44:41.525 --> 01:44:44.486
It's been eight weeks
with no new development.

01:44:44.486 --> 01:44:48.615
I think the best thing
for everyone is to try

01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:50.033
and put this behind us.

01:44:53.203 --> 01:44:56.331
Again, we're sorry for your loss.

01:44:57.708 --> 01:44:59.126
- Ma'am.

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:01.712
(gentle music)

01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:21.231
- Any regrets, now that
the town's back to normal?

01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:23.984
- Oh, there's always regrets.

01:45:24.943 --> 01:45:28.530
But some things need to
be done just the same.

01:45:30.699 --> 01:45:32.576
- Think we'll hear from Dooger again?

01:45:34.119 --> 01:45:36.038
- Nah, I doubt it.

01:45:36.038 --> 01:45:39.791
Guys like that, they don't
last very long on the streets.

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:44.671
- Still it was nice of him
to help with, you know.

01:45:44.671 --> 01:45:47.799
- Treena's arrangements?
- Yes, that.

01:45:47.799 --> 01:45:49.634
- A wooden box?

01:45:49.634 --> 01:45:52.179
We could have done better than that.

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:55.390
- Not will all the attention in town.

01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:58.351
No, simple was better in this situation.

01:45:58.351 --> 01:46:01.021
No ceremony, it's done.

01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:02.481
That's what's important.

01:46:03.982 --> 01:46:07.194
We've helped a lot of them over the years.

01:46:08.111 --> 01:46:10.697
(somber music)

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:16.661
Young girls, searching for their way.

01:46:20.916 --> 01:46:22.584
- The ones we could, anyway.

01:46:35.972 --> 01:46:38.558
(Blake sighs)

01:46:41.186 --> 01:46:45.732
- Would have been nice to have
helped this last one though.

01:46:45.732 --> 01:46:47.567
She was a special one.

01:46:49.402 --> 01:46:51.780
- At least she's at rest now.

01:46:52.823 --> 01:46:55.909
A lost soul shouldn't wander forever.
