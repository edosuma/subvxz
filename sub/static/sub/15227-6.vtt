01:19.679 --> 01:20.879
Sunshine Cab...

01:20.946 --> 01:22.046
(clears throat)

01:22.114 --> 01:24.115
Oh, hello.
      Hello, Mr. Ratledge.

01:24.183 --> 01:26.852
Yeah. Oh.

01:26.919 --> 01:28.253
Oh, yes.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.520
Major problem.
           Yes, sir.

01:29.588 --> 01:31.055
I'll be right up.
     I'll be right up, sir.

01:34.926 --> 01:36.761
Hey, Louie, Louie, Louie!

01:36.829 --> 01:38.196
What?
                      Aren't you
           forgetting something?

01:38.264 --> 01:41.266
I've never seen you go up
       and visit the boss

01:41.333 --> 01:43.668
without bringing
   some token of your esteem.

01:43.736 --> 01:45.403
You're right-- gift, gift.

01:46.872 --> 01:48.606
Jeff, uh,
    give me the golf balls.

01:48.674 --> 01:50.742
You already gave him
      the golf balls, Lou.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.377
Well, what else we got
       in Lost and Found?

01:52.445 --> 01:54.913
Uh, let me see.

01:54.981 --> 01:57.215
You got the cigars,
        that cheap wine,

01:57.282 --> 01:59.684
a stuffed owl and a Waterpik.

01:59.752 --> 02:01.085
He's very upset.

02:01.153 --> 02:02.253
Give me the Waterpik.

02:07.994 --> 02:09.526
Where's he goin'?

02:09.595 --> 02:11.563
He's going
to see the boss.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.864
Louie <i>is</i> the boss.

02:13.932 --> 02:15.300
ELAINE: He may be
             the boss down here,

02:15.368 --> 02:18.036
but he still has to answer
to the guy upstairs.

02:18.103 --> 02:19.737
That's who
he's going to see.

02:19.805 --> 02:22.807
He's going to give
        God a Waterpik?

02:24.376 --> 02:26.144
I'll explain it
                   to him later.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.478
Please, please.

02:27.546 --> 02:29.480
I don't care.
I want the guy brought up

02:29.548 --> 02:31.115
right now, right here,
you understand?!
         Mr. Ratledge,

02:31.183 --> 02:33.718
I think that it would be better
     if I did this myself.

02:33.786 --> 02:35.286
You want to do it yourself?
               Yeah, I'll do it.

02:35.354 --> 02:37.088
Then do it right now!
               Yes, I will, sir.
                    I will, sir.

02:37.156 --> 02:38.723
Yes, I will.

02:38.791 --> 02:40.458
(door slams)

02:40.526 --> 02:41.926
Uh, Jeff?

02:41.994 --> 02:43.195
Yeah.
Can I talk to you?

02:45.298 --> 02:47.932
What is it, Louie?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.101
Uh, not here. Come on.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.304
Come back here.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.277
Come on in.

03:01.580 --> 03:03.081
So, uh...

03:03.149 --> 03:05.283
What's Ratledge
      so hot about, Louie?

03:05.351 --> 03:07.485
Uh... why don't
                 you have a seat

03:07.552 --> 03:09.020
and make yourself
              comfortable, Jeff?

03:09.088 --> 03:11.022
All right.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.024
You know ho--

03:15.594 --> 03:17.528
How about you sit here?

03:19.732 --> 03:24.535
You know how, uh,
        I have you haul

03:24.603 --> 03:27.505
those used parts to the junkyard

03:27.573 --> 03:29.507
and sell them
       for Mr. Ratledge?

03:29.575 --> 03:31.942
Yeah.

03:32.010 --> 03:33.811
Well...

03:33.879 --> 03:37.115
you didn't quite do it
        for Ratledge

03:37.183 --> 03:39.450
as much as you did it for me.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.522
You mean you kept
                 all that money?

03:44.590 --> 03:46.124
Yeah.

03:46.192 --> 03:49.360
Oh... now I know what
       Ratledge is so hot about.

03:49.428 --> 03:50.828
Yeah.

03:50.896 --> 03:53.832
Hey, you must be in pretty
            deep trouble, Louie.

03:53.899 --> 03:55.500
Now, here's
the interesting part.

03:59.638 --> 04:02.607
Ratledge doesn't
know it was me.

04:03.708 --> 04:05.076
He doesn't?

04:05.144 --> 04:08.246
No.
               (laughs)

04:08.314 --> 04:09.413
He doesn't?

04:09.481 --> 04:11.415
No.
                (laughing)

04:13.919 --> 04:15.853
Boy, you got lucky!

04:19.324 --> 04:21.259
But you didn't.

04:24.763 --> 04:26.731
I gotta fire you, Jeff.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.032
Me?!
    Uh-huh.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.434
Hey, wait a minute, Louie--

04:29.501 --> 04:31.335
I was just delivering
               that stuff.

04:31.403 --> 04:33.170
I didn't even know
              what was going on.

04:33.238 --> 04:35.740
All I did was what
              you told me to do.

04:35.807 --> 04:39.410
Yeah... that's what makes
letting you go so painful.

04:41.513 --> 04:43.448
I'm going to go
    tell Ratledge the truth.

04:43.515 --> 04:44.715
No, no, no, no, Jeff!

04:44.783 --> 04:46.384
Jeff, what good
would that do?

04:46.451 --> 04:48.319
I mean, he's never
going to believe

04:48.386 --> 04:49.621
that you weren't involved.

04:49.688 --> 04:51.156
You brought the goods there.

04:51.223 --> 04:52.891
You collected the money.

04:52.958 --> 04:54.859
All he'll do
is fire me, too.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.627
Now, listen, I got a plan.

04:57.796 --> 05:01.066
Listen,
let me tell Ratledge

05:01.133 --> 05:02.133
that I fired you.

05:02.201 --> 05:04.035
This way,
I can stay here

05:04.103 --> 05:05.937
and, and when he cools down,

05:06.005 --> 05:07.572
I'll get you
your job back for you.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.639
You know Ratledge--

05:08.707 --> 05:10.175
I mean, one minute
he's a maniac,

05:10.242 --> 05:11.876
the next minute,
he's a pussycat.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.544
Come on, trust me, Jeff.

05:13.612 --> 05:15.213
No!

05:15.280 --> 05:16.781
Hey, you got a better plan?

05:22.588 --> 05:24.288
No.

05:24.356 --> 05:25.957
Then it's a deal?

05:27.759 --> 05:29.761
Yeah.
All right.

05:29.828 --> 05:31.262
But let me tell you
              something, Louie--

05:31.329 --> 05:32.897
I think this stinks.

05:32.964 --> 05:34.399
I think you stink.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.767
I think the deal stinks.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.402
The whole thing stinks!

05:39.772 --> 05:41.372
Jeff, I'm worried
     you're going into this

05:41.440 --> 05:42.907
with a bad attitude.

05:53.119 --> 05:55.519
So what do I do until
       I get my job back, Louie?

05:55.587 --> 05:57.989
Let me give you a couple
of hundred bucks, Jeff.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.924
I don't want your
                    dirty money.

05:59.992 --> 06:02.426
Great! I wouldn't
  respect you if you took it.

06:02.494 --> 06:03.761
Now, look,

06:03.829 --> 06:07.499
I'll get you another job
with a different cab company--

06:07.566 --> 06:09.234
just temporarily, you know.

06:09.301 --> 06:13.004
I mean, uh, look, all I got
 to do is pick up a telephone.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.873
I mean, uh, this can be
    our little secret, okay?

06:15.941 --> 06:17.441
I don't want
       to embarrass you.

06:17.509 --> 06:18.609
All right?
                       Go ahead.

06:19.845 --> 06:21.379
And another thing!

06:21.446 --> 06:24.115
What you did was not only

06:24.183 --> 06:27.518
unspeakable,
but unforgivable.

06:27.586 --> 06:29.187
I mean, look,

06:29.254 --> 06:32.456
you violated the trust
of this good man.

06:32.524 --> 06:34.458
Forget about
violating the law.

06:34.526 --> 06:36.561
You bit the hand
that fed you.

06:36.628 --> 06:37.995
Now, if it was up to me,

06:38.063 --> 06:39.730
you would be going
straight to jail.

06:39.798 --> 06:40.965
You're getting off easy!

06:41.033 --> 06:43.034
Now, get out of here
before I lose my temper!

06:43.101 --> 06:45.502
Go on! Go on,
get out of here.

06:45.570 --> 06:47.505
Get!

06:50.576 --> 06:53.077
De Palma...
                       Yes, sir.

06:53.145 --> 06:55.713
De Palma, I thought
you handled that very well.

06:55.781 --> 06:57.248
Thank you, sir.

06:57.316 --> 06:59.751
I... it wasn't easy,
             but I was outraged.

06:59.818 --> 07:01.686
I was outraged.

07:01.753 --> 07:04.422
You know, it's a
               funny thing, sir.

07:04.489 --> 07:07.491
In a few days...

07:07.559 --> 07:09.560
we'll all be
            missing old Jeff.

07:09.628 --> 07:10.661
Not me.

07:10.729 --> 07:12.163
Me, either.

07:12.231 --> 07:13.764
Oh, no.

07:13.832 --> 07:16.534
I want you to check this
inventory against the stock

07:16.602 --> 07:19.904
and any discrepancies
brought to my attention
immediately.

07:19.972 --> 07:21.339
Yes, yes, Mr. Ratledge.

07:21.406 --> 07:23.007
Yes, sir. Thank you.

07:24.943 --> 07:26.878
Hi.

07:29.682 --> 07:32.183
You own this place, don't you?

07:32.250 --> 07:34.852
Yes.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.855
Well...

07:40.326 --> 07:43.394
I'd like to take
this opportunity

07:43.462 --> 07:47.699
to thank you
for providing me with a job.

07:49.601 --> 07:52.837
It changed my life.

07:52.905 --> 07:56.808
Why, if you had seen
me three years ago,

07:56.875 --> 07:57.841
you would have said...

07:57.909 --> 07:59.610
Who is this bum?

07:59.677 --> 08:02.213
Exactly!

08:06.719 --> 08:09.053
TONY: All right, Louie,
what's going on?

08:09.120 --> 08:10.721
Look, I'd rather
       not talk about it.

08:10.789 --> 08:12.090
Besides, it's none
       of your business.

08:12.157 --> 08:13.991
Yeah, but why did
         you fire Jeff?
TONY: Yeah!

08:14.059 --> 08:15.426
What's the idea,
                     Louie, huh?

08:15.494 --> 08:16.694
All right, all right,

08:16.762 --> 08:18.729
I guess you're gonna find out
        sooner or later.

08:18.797 --> 08:21.933
It's better
     that it comes from me.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.201
Look, I, I can't
      believe this myself.

08:24.269 --> 08:28.005
It seems that,
        that Ratledge...

08:28.073 --> 08:31.609
found out that Jeff was

08:31.676 --> 08:35.346
making a little extra money
 at the cab company's expense.

08:35.414 --> 08:36.780
He was stealing?

08:36.847 --> 08:38.849
I know;
   it's-it's hard to believe.

08:38.917 --> 08:40.417
I'm still stunned.

08:42.754 --> 08:44.755
Jeff isn't a thief.

08:44.823 --> 08:46.757
I feel violated.

08:48.259 --> 08:50.327
Jeff is not a thief.

08:50.395 --> 08:52.697
Yeah, I'd like
 to believe that, too, Reiger,

08:52.765 --> 08:55.599
but, uh, you know,
       Jeff was special.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.267
He was like a son to me;

08:57.335 --> 08:59.270
a beautiful, black son.

09:00.606 --> 09:03.274
Jeff is not a thief, Louie.

09:03.341 --> 09:05.109
Not in his heart, Reiger.

09:05.176 --> 09:06.343
It's society.

09:06.411 --> 09:08.112
It's his environment.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.547
Jeff is a victim.

09:09.615 --> 09:12.115
Jeff is not a thief, Louie.

09:12.183 --> 09:13.718
I heard you the first time.

09:13.786 --> 09:15.386
What's the point, Reiger?

09:15.454 --> 09:17.288
Well... (clears throat)

09:17.356 --> 09:19.857
correct me if I'm wrong.

09:22.060 --> 09:26.831
But I think what
      he is trying to say

09:26.899 --> 09:31.302
is that Jeff is not a thief.

09:31.370 --> 09:32.302
Am I right?

09:32.370 --> 09:33.671
(speaking
indistinctly)

09:33.739 --> 09:35.740
Look, look, I don't want to talk
      about this anymore.

09:35.808 --> 09:38.743
Look, this is worse
for me than any of you.

09:38.810 --> 09:41.078
Now I'm going to do my best
to straighten this out.

09:41.146 --> 09:43.547
In the meantime,
I've got to find a replacement.

09:43.615 --> 09:44.782
And let me tell you something:

09:44.850 --> 09:46.083
It's going to be like hell

09:46.151 --> 09:47.518
trying to replace
        a guy like Jeff.

09:47.585 --> 09:49.853
You-- you speak English?

09:49.921 --> 09:50.921
Yeah.

09:50.989 --> 09:51.922
You've just been promoted.

09:51.990 --> 09:52.924
Get in the cage.

09:52.992 --> 09:55.058
Come on. In there.
ALEX: Hey!

09:55.126 --> 09:56.760
Louie, how could
                    you do that?

09:56.828 --> 09:58.929
How could you, you just
       give someone else his job

09:58.997 --> 10:00.764
Yeah, Louie?
           and let him be thrown
             out on the streets?

10:00.832 --> 10:02.766
Hey, listen, Louie,
you could explain, Louie...

10:02.834 --> 10:04.935
Will you maniacs just relax?!

10:05.003 --> 10:06.737
I know exactly what I'm doing.

10:06.805 --> 10:08.973
Now, when the time is right,

10:09.041 --> 10:10.942
I will get Jeff his job back.

10:11.009 --> 10:15.579
Everybody will be happy
and there will be no harm done.

10:15.647 --> 10:19.583
De Palma... I've been thinking
  about what you said before,

10:19.651 --> 10:20.851
and I think you're right.

10:20.919 --> 10:22.386
I was too lenient.

10:22.454 --> 10:23.788
I just called the cops.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.523
I'm having Jeff arrested.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.308
Here you go.
Thank you.

10:44.375 --> 10:45.476
Thank you very much.

10:45.544 --> 10:46.877
Louie, what are
                you doing here?!

10:46.945 --> 10:48.879
I told them
I was your attorney.

10:50.014 --> 10:52.583
Now, just take it easy, Jeff,

10:52.651 --> 10:54.785
and, and I'll take care
of everything.

10:54.853 --> 10:56.020
Hey, don't take
               care of anything.

10:56.087 --> 10:57.088
You've already done enough.

10:57.155 --> 10:58.389
I'm not going
              to prison for you!

10:58.456 --> 10:59.390
The deal is off.

10:59.458 --> 11:00.758
I want you out of here.
                          Guard!

11:00.826 --> 11:03.160
Now, now, now, now, Jeff,
    now, Jeff, don't panic.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.328
I mean, now, look,

11:04.396 --> 11:06.764
nobody anticipated
     anybody going to jail,

11:06.832 --> 11:09.567
but if we just stay calm,
         we can salvage

11:09.634 --> 11:11.168
an otherwise perfect plan.

11:11.236 --> 11:14.071
The deal is off, Louie.

11:14.139 --> 11:17.308
Hey, hey, I'm holding up
     my end of the bargain.

11:17.376 --> 11:20.477
I'm-I'm working on
       softening Ratledge

11:20.545 --> 11:22.813
and-and looking
  for a temporary job for you.

11:22.881 --> 11:24.181
Oh, "looking
     for a temporary job"?

11:24.249 --> 11:26.183
You told me you could get me
    a job with a phone call.

11:26.251 --> 11:28.352
Well, that one fell through.

11:28.420 --> 11:29.353
They heard you were a thief.

11:29.421 --> 11:30.955
Guard!

11:31.023 --> 11:32.657
Jeff! Now, come on, Jeff.

11:32.724 --> 11:34.492
Come on, now.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.960
Give me a chance.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.528
You know, I've been
good to you.

11:37.596 --> 11:39.663
Well, what have you ever
           ever done for me that
            should go to prison?

11:39.731 --> 11:42.399
Will you get prison
    out of your mind, Jeff?

11:42.467 --> 11:45.269
Now, nobody is
     going to go to prison!

11:45.337 --> 11:48.572
But in the unlikely event
      that somebody should go...

11:48.640 --> 11:51.675
Look, prison is not
               such a bad place.

11:51.743 --> 11:53.610
I mean, they give you a bed.

11:53.678 --> 11:55.278
They give you food.

11:55.346 --> 11:57.214
They give you a toilet.

11:57.282 --> 12:00.351
That's pretty much life
            as we know it, Jeff.

12:00.419 --> 12:01.585
Guard!

12:01.653 --> 12:02.753
Come on, come on.

12:02.821 --> 12:04.355
Now I'm begging ya, Jeff.

12:04.423 --> 12:07.091
I mean, think about it.

12:07.159 --> 12:10.027
You'd have a much easier time
in the joint than I would.

12:10.095 --> 12:11.195
What do you mean by that?

12:11.263 --> 12:13.897
You know what goes on
in those places.

12:13.965 --> 12:16.934
A tasty morsel like me
wouldn't last five minutes.

12:19.004 --> 12:21.171
Uh, Mr. Reiger posted
your bail, Bennett.

12:21.239 --> 12:22.340
You're free to go.

12:22.407 --> 12:23.507
All right.

12:23.575 --> 12:25.275
No, no, no, Jeff,
     Jeff, whatever you do,

12:25.343 --> 12:27.979
don't tell Reiger about this.

12:28.046 --> 12:30.481
Come on, let me have a chance
to straighten it all out.

12:30.549 --> 12:34.485
Jeff, we're family.

12:34.552 --> 12:36.887
Now you got every right
to be angry at me,

12:36.955 --> 12:39.023
but I know you won't tell him,

12:39.090 --> 12:41.225
not if you have one ounce

12:41.293 --> 12:45.896
of loyalty, affection,
or gratitude left for me.

12:50.001 --> 12:51.001
He did it, Alex.

12:51.069 --> 12:52.536
I didn't want
                 to lose my job,

12:52.604 --> 12:55.005
but I didn't want to squeal
      on him, so I took the rap.

12:55.073 --> 12:56.673
Now he expects me
                to go to prison.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.211
What're you looking
      at me like that for?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.583
I don't care
            what you say, Louie.

13:05.651 --> 13:06.917
I made up my mind.

13:06.985 --> 13:10.521
Jeff, Jeff, you are not going
    to walk up those stairs

13:10.589 --> 13:14.024
and destroy another
  human being's life, are you?

13:14.092 --> 13:15.893
Yeah.
No, no.

13:15.960 --> 13:16.961
Jeff.

13:17.028 --> 13:20.931
Louie, if... if he doesn't,
            I will.

13:22.800 --> 13:26.603
All right, look, look,
      let me do it myself.

13:26.671 --> 13:30.207
If Ratledge hears the truth from
me, maybe he'll go easier on me.

13:32.143 --> 13:34.144
All right.

13:34.212 --> 13:36.046
Gift-- I gotta
                 get him a gift.

13:38.483 --> 13:41.551
You have 15 minutes to get
 those charges dropped, Louie.

13:41.619 --> 13:42.787
15 minutes.

13:42.854 --> 13:44.355
I'll be waiting right here.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.157
Okay, 15 minutes.

13:49.227 --> 13:52.096
Jeff, what if I made
        a nice donation

13:52.163 --> 13:54.798
to the United Negro
         College Fund?

13:56.801 --> 13:59.870
All right, 15 minutes.

14:04.376 --> 14:06.710
(knocking)

14:06.778 --> 14:08.546
Yes?

14:12.384 --> 14:14.252
What is it, De Palma?

14:14.319 --> 14:17.221
Uh, nothing much, sir.

14:19.591 --> 14:24.294
It's just that, uh, I was
  kicking myself the other day

14:24.362 --> 14:27.231
because I never gave you
            anything

14:27.299 --> 14:30.200
for the lovely Mrs. Ratledge.

14:30.268 --> 14:32.636
Uh, so, uh, would you please
         give her this

14:32.704 --> 14:33.904
with my compliments.

14:33.972 --> 14:35.006
What is it?

14:35.073 --> 14:39.009
It's a Norelco
        Ladybug shaver.

14:40.111 --> 14:43.414
Thanks, De Palma.

14:43.481 --> 14:46.483
Now, what did you really
     want to see me about?

14:50.722 --> 14:53.457
I came to talk
       to you about Jeff.

14:53.525 --> 14:54.825
Jeff the Thief?

14:54.893 --> 14:58.262
Thief is a very harsh word,
         Mr. Ratledge.
Mm-hmm.

14:58.329 --> 15:00.164
Jeff the Misguided.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.400
Uh, Jeff the Misunderstood.

15:02.467 --> 15:05.035
Jeff the
  Deserving-of-Another-Chance.

15:05.103 --> 15:08.372
De Palma, when a man
commits a crime,

15:08.440 --> 15:11.442
he should be prepared
to pay the consequences.

15:11.510 --> 15:12.709
Now don't you agree?

15:12.777 --> 15:15.045
Well, I don't...

15:18.383 --> 15:22.953
Louie, I know how to deal with a
man who steals from the company.

15:23.021 --> 15:25.122
Now I don't care
  to discuss this any further.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.357
If you'll excuse me...

15:29.661 --> 15:30.860
Yes, sir.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.214
(gasping):
         I'm the thief.

15:50.281 --> 15:53.050
What are you talking about?

15:53.118 --> 15:54.785
I arranged everything...

15:54.853 --> 15:56.853
and took all the money.

15:56.921 --> 15:59.723
Jeff was just following
    the orders of his boss.

15:59.791 --> 16:02.993
He's the most honest man
   I ever met, Mr. Ratledge.

16:03.061 --> 16:06.363
If anybody deserves
    to go to jail, it's me.

16:06.430 --> 16:08.699
De Palma...

16:08.767 --> 16:12.102
If this is true, De Palma,
why didn't Jeff speak up?

16:12.170 --> 16:13.603
Because he likes me.

16:16.007 --> 16:19.143
(laughing)

16:19.210 --> 16:21.779
You expect me to believe this?

16:21.846 --> 16:23.380
Believe what?

16:23.448 --> 16:25.883
This whole story, De Palma.

16:25.950 --> 16:27.551
Come on, knock it off.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.520
I know what you're
trying to do.

16:30.588 --> 16:33.724
You're trying to take the
rap for another man, huh?

16:33.792 --> 16:35.492
Well, it won't work.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.395
You think I'd go easier
on you than on him

16:38.463 --> 16:41.232
because of your long history
of service for the company?

16:41.299 --> 16:42.666
Is that what you...?

16:42.734 --> 16:44.167
Well, you're
right, I would.

16:44.235 --> 16:46.804
It's a noble
gesture, De Palma,

16:46.872 --> 16:50.040
but I won't let you take the
 blame for another man's crime.

16:57.449 --> 16:59.950
You're saying
     you don't believe me?

17:00.017 --> 17:01.619
Of course not.

17:01.686 --> 17:06.156
You mean, not even if I
 brought another cabbie up here?

17:06.223 --> 17:07.490
No! No, no.
                    Alex Reiger?

17:07.558 --> 17:09.659
If he told you that
                I was the thief?

17:09.727 --> 17:11.560
No, stop.
                    You wouldn't
             believe him either?

17:11.628 --> 17:15.799
No, of course not. Go on!

17:15.867 --> 17:18.035
I don't know what it is
       with this guy Jeff

17:18.103 --> 17:20.771
that, that is so special that
  you would go to bat for him.

17:20.838 --> 17:22.406
But I'll tell ya
       what I'm gonna do.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.040
I'm gonna drop all the charges
          against him.

17:24.108 --> 17:26.542
I'm gonna let you
have his job back, okay?

17:26.611 --> 17:28.310
I just hope this Jeff Bennett
          appreciates

17:28.378 --> 17:29.780
what you're doing for him.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.681
It was nothing.

17:34.853 --> 17:36.687
After all--

17:36.755 --> 17:37.888
I'm the thief.

17:37.955 --> 17:40.257
Enough already.
        Get out of here.

17:42.260 --> 17:45.062
(high-pitched guffawing)

17:45.129 --> 17:48.165
You know, I, I think I will
      bring Alex Reiger up here.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.400
No! No!
                Yeah, yeah.

17:49.467 --> 17:50.801
I'm gonna
             bring him up.

17:50.868 --> 17:52.469
No! No!
                I'm gonna
               bring him up.

17:52.537 --> 17:54.738
Stop it. Stop it.
Knock it off.

17:54.806 --> 17:57.807
De Palma, cut it out!
           Reiger, come up here.

17:57.875 --> 18:01.811
If you liked my confession,
         you're gonna love this.

18:05.349 --> 18:09.586
Reiger, Reiger, Reiger,
               tell Mr. Ratledge

18:09.654 --> 18:12.389
who the real thief is.

18:17.228 --> 18:19.396
Hello, Mr. Ratledge.

18:19.464 --> 18:21.699
Go on, go on.

18:21.766 --> 18:24.067
I, I don't know what's
been going on in here.

18:24.135 --> 18:27.204
All I can do is tell
you what I know.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.307
Louie has been taking
the stuff and selling it

18:30.375 --> 18:32.175
and keeping the
money for himself.

18:41.486 --> 18:43.220
And Jeff took the rap
for it because...

18:43.288 --> 18:45.322
Because he likes him.

18:50.161 --> 18:52.262
Oh, thank you,
        thank you, Alex.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.964
I think you'll be happy to know

18:54.032 --> 18:56.466
that I've dropped all the
    charges against Bennett.

18:56.534 --> 18:58.369
And I'm gonna let him
       have his job back.

18:58.436 --> 19:00.237
Now you get out
      of here, you scamp.

19:04.175 --> 19:06.277
And you take your
       sidekick with you.

19:06.344 --> 19:08.712
RATLEDGE:
Get out of here.

19:11.182 --> 19:14.684
Well, ta-ta.

19:14.752 --> 19:16.587
(laughing)

19:25.463 --> 19:27.831
Louie, Louie,

19:27.899 --> 19:29.332
do you ever play golf, Louie?

19:29.400 --> 19:32.469
Why yes, I do, sir,
    but I cheat on my score.

19:34.405 --> 19:36.306
We'll have
to play sometime.

19:36.373 --> 19:38.241
Oh, that would be
      swell, Mr. Ratledge.

19:38.309 --> 19:40.710
Ben.

19:40.778 --> 19:42.546
Ben.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.427
Reiger, Reiger, you want
        to have a drink with me?

19:56.494 --> 19:57.527
No.

19:57.595 --> 19:59.196
I just came back
to get my jacket.

19:59.263 --> 20:01.531
Well, Reiger, you
                  gotta help me;
              you gotta help me.

20:01.599 --> 20:04.434
What do you want?

20:04.502 --> 20:07.604
I've been trying
         to sort this thing out.

20:07.672 --> 20:09.539
I mean...

20:09.607 --> 20:12.309
I stole...

20:12.376 --> 20:16.279
I lied...

20:16.347 --> 20:19.516
I betrayed a friend...

20:19.584 --> 20:22.819
and now I got extra
               money in the bank

20:22.887 --> 20:26.323
and a 9:00 tee-off
               time on Saturday.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.792
Good night, Louie.

20:28.859 --> 20:31.929
No, Reiger, no,
      you got to help me.

20:31.997 --> 20:34.297
No, explain to me what
it's like to be honest.

20:34.365 --> 20:37.201
I mean, because...

20:37.269 --> 20:40.904
if I had a chance
to do that all over again,

20:40.972 --> 20:44.775
I'd like to know one
    reason why I shouldn't.

20:46.544 --> 20:50.514
I can't explain the feeling
    I get from being honest.

20:50.582 --> 20:55.919
I mean, it's like trying to
    explain, uh, April in Paris.

20:55.986 --> 20:58.421
You can't understand it
   unless you've been there.

20:58.489 --> 21:01.091
Oh!

21:01.159 --> 21:04.327
I understand
        April in Paris.

21:04.395 --> 21:08.899
It's like having Havana cigars,

21:08.966 --> 21:11.401
a great drink of booze

21:11.469 --> 21:13.937
and being off scot-free.

21:14.005 --> 21:16.873
That's April in Paris, Reiger.

21:19.811 --> 21:22.879
Let's face it,
Reiger, crime pays.

21:27.751 --> 21:30.821
You know, people
       go around thinking

21:30.888 --> 21:33.090
that if they do something bad,

21:33.158 --> 21:36.360
then something bad
   has got to happen to them.

21:36.427 --> 21:38.995
Well, I'm living proof that
       that is not true.

21:42.166 --> 21:43.934
No answer?

21:44.002 --> 21:45.836
No answer from the honest man?

21:47.805 --> 21:49.840
Peh.

21:51.275 --> 21:53.043
Where're you going?

21:53.111 --> 21:54.912
Up here.

21:54.979 --> 21:56.112
What do you got?

21:56.180 --> 21:57.414
Some little hiding place up
         there, Louie?

21:57.482 --> 22:00.551
Yeah, I got a place
for my stuff.

22:00.618 --> 22:02.386
Okay, Louie, you see?

22:02.453 --> 22:04.755
That's the price
                you have to pay.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.056
Because you're a thief,

22:06.124 --> 22:07.824
you have to go
     through life believing

22:07.892 --> 22:09.492
that everybody else is a thief.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.194
That's why you have
              to hide your stash

22:11.262 --> 22:13.130
in some crummy
                little air duct.

22:13.197 --> 22:17.267
Boy, you lead a real crummy
  little life, you know that?

22:17.335 --> 22:20.136
You're a frightened man, Louie.

22:20.204 --> 22:24.441
You're grasping
       at straws, Reiger.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.877
You know what it's like
        in this garage.

22:26.945 --> 22:29.946
There's a thief
       every four inches.

22:30.014 --> 22:31.748
Hey, what about me, Louie?
      What about me, huh?

22:31.816 --> 22:33.650
Aren't you afraid I'm going
      to steal your stuff?

22:33.718 --> 22:34.918
I know where you're hiding it.

22:34.985 --> 22:37.754
You?!

22:37.822 --> 22:39.156
The honest man?!

22:39.223 --> 22:41.325
Nah!

22:43.327 --> 22:45.596
Yeah, I guess you're right.

22:45.663 --> 22:49.333
You do what you do
      and I do what I do.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.701
Well, good night.

23:01.379 --> 23:04.181
Good night, Reiger.

23:12.690 --> 23:14.691
Reiger!

23:14.759 --> 23:16.192
<i>Reiger!</i>

23:18.396 --> 23:21.765
<i>Reiger!</i>

23:27.839 --> 23:31.842
(theme song playing)

23:52.263 --> 23:53.730
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:53.798 --> 23:54.798
(man grumbling)

23:55.305 --> 24:01.153
