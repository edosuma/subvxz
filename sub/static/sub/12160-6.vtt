WEBVTT

00:03.053 --> 00:04.686
What are you doing?

00:04.721 --> 00:07.521
Cleaning a flintlock musket
from the revolutionary war

00:07.556 --> 00:10.191
while enjoying
a little bacon and biscuits.

00:10.226 --> 00:13.661
This is what
our forefathers died for.

00:13.695 --> 00:15.596
Can't you do that in your den?

00:15.630 --> 00:17.131
The bill of rights says
I can do this

00:17.166 --> 00:19.367
wherever I want to do this.
Really?

00:19.401 --> 00:21.936
Well, what if your 2-year-old
grandson walked in here?

00:21.971 --> 00:24.471
And overpowers me?

00:24.505 --> 00:25.672
Your back could be turned.

00:25.706 --> 00:28.475
You could be reaching
for a piece of bacon.

00:28.509 --> 00:30.143
Yeah. He could grab the musket
out of my hand,

00:30.178 --> 00:31.845
shove me to the ground,

00:31.880 --> 00:33.546
pour the correct amount
of powder in here,

00:33.581 --> 00:35.916
take the ramrod,
jam it down there,

00:35.950 --> 00:37.985
get a musket ball,
put that in there,

00:38.019 --> 00:40.552
take the ramrod back out,
jam that down there,

00:40.587 --> 00:42.688
half-cock it,
put a percussion cap in there,

00:42.722 --> 00:43.722
fully cock the thing,

00:43.757 --> 00:47.260
and somehow shoot me
in the foot.

00:47.294 --> 00:48.794
Just keep the safety on.

00:48.828 --> 00:52.498
Honey, this whole gun
is a safety.

00:52.532 --> 00:55.166
It's a miracle we're not
speaking British right now.

00:55.201 --> 00:57.302
Morning, mom.
Hi, sweetie.

00:57.336 --> 00:59.337
Morning, dad.
What you got there?

00:59.372 --> 01:02.107
A... .69-caliber flintlock?

01:02.141 --> 01:03.942
That's my girl.

01:03.976 --> 01:05.977
Hey, can I camp out
at the Magness Arena

01:06.012 --> 01:07.913
for Katy Perry tickets
Thursday night?

01:07.947 --> 01:10.015
You bet. You know
how I feel about camping.

01:10.049 --> 01:13.183
No, Mike, Mike...
Honey, it's a school night.

01:13.218 --> 01:15.219
Oh, that's right.
School night. Can't go.

01:15.253 --> 01:17.187
(Under breath)
Killjoy strikes again.

01:17.222 --> 01:19.089
What was that?

01:21.359 --> 01:24.094
Look, Eve... was just
saying how nice you looked,

01:24.129 --> 01:27.496
and I was...
I was agreeing with her.

01:27.531 --> 01:29.065
Well, it just didn't seem

01:29.099 --> 01:31.634
like nearly enough time went by
for you guys to say all that.

01:31.668 --> 01:33.836
There's never enough time, baby,
to tell you how good you look.

01:33.870 --> 01:35.305
Ah.

01:35.425 --> 01:37.340
Last Man Standing - S01E06
Good Cop, Bad Cop

01:37.460 --> 01:39.443
Original air date
November 8, 2011

01:39.563 --> 01:42.459
Sync and corrections by Gatto
for www.addic7ed.com

01:42.579 --> 01:46.448
Hey, v., could you
come in here a minute?

01:46.482 --> 01:48.283
I hung up my n gun.

01:48.318 --> 01:49.985
Oh, that's nice.

01:50.019 --> 01:51.320
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:51.354 --> 01:52.787
Well, you don't seem
happy about it.

01:52.822 --> 01:53.788
Well, the simplicity of it

01:53.823 --> 01:55.557
in contrast
with my new shotguns

01:55.591 --> 01:58.293
makes the whole den
look a little busy.

01:59.894 --> 02:01.829
Sometimes I don't know
if you're Billy the Kid

02:01.863 --> 02:03.630
or Billy Elliot.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.000
Yay! I'm going to work
like I like.

02:06.034 --> 02:07.034
(Laughs)

02:08.470 --> 02:09.971
Hey, Kris, stop for a second.
Listen.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.472
This isn't gonna last forever.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.639
And you're doing the right
thing. You're saving money.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.008
You're applying to colleges.

02:14.042 --> 02:16.042
You're doing everything I did
when I was your age,

02:16.110 --> 02:17.510
except you're taking care
of a baby,

02:17.544 --> 02:20.380
and I was taking care of this
chopped and channeled Mercury

02:20.414 --> 02:21.982
with a flathead.
I loved that car.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.484
- It was so cool because
I had these side pipes--
- yeah, yeah, dad,

02:24.518 --> 02:25.952
I know I should
just suck it up,

02:26.020 --> 02:27.954
but last week,
my manager, who hates me...

02:27.989 --> 02:30.123
- He doesn't hate you.
- No, he hates me. He hates me.

02:30.157 --> 02:31.523
He took me off of station one,

02:31.557 --> 02:33.792
and he stuck me at the counter
where nobody tips.

02:33.826 --> 02:35.660
We, speak up.
Stand up for yourself.

02:35.695 --> 02:38.297
I have been. I point
at the tip jar and I shout,

02:38.331 --> 02:40.832
"hello! I'm poor!"

02:42.768 --> 02:45.104
Honey, honey, you have
to stand up for yourself.

02:45.138 --> 02:47.238
Your dad's right.
I mean, when I was working

02:47.239 --> 02:48.973
at that yogurt shop in high-school,

02:49.008 --> 02:51.309
my boss had me work
every Friday night.

02:51.343 --> 02:53.644
And all of my friends--
they were all out,

02:53.678 --> 02:55.613
they're having a great time.

02:55.647 --> 02:59.117
Oh. Well, what did
you do about it?

02:59.151 --> 03:02.920
Nothing. I-I was just...

03:02.954 --> 03:05.222
Getting it off my chest.

03:05.256 --> 03:08.958
Is is amazing! (Squeals)

03:08.993 --> 03:12.295
It is amazing. Look,
she's holding on to a newspaper.

03:12.330 --> 03:13.663
They're having
open auditions for

03:13.697 --> 03:15.399
"America's next hot teen model"

03:15.433 --> 03:17.734
here in Denver, and they're only
expecting, like, 10,000 girls,

03:17.768 --> 03:21.404
and 12 get in,
so I'm pretty confident.

03:21.438 --> 03:22.971
But, honey, isn't that the show

03:23.006 --> 03:24.907
where all the girls
end up with eating disorders?

03:24.941 --> 03:26.775
I know! I can't wait!

03:26.809 --> 03:29.211
And all I have to do
is bring in photos, a bio,

03:29.246 --> 03:31.647
and permission from my parents.
So is it okay?

03:31.681 --> 03:34.150
Well, does it cost any dough?
No.

03:34.184 --> 03:35.550
Do we have to drive you?
Nope.

03:35.584 --> 03:38.819
Will you miss any school?
No more than usual.

03:38.854 --> 03:40.655
Well, you know, uh,

03:40.689 --> 03:41.822
you know, follow your passion,
huh?

03:41.857 --> 03:43.324
Yes.

03:43.359 --> 03:46.494
Ah. Well, uh, your father and I
are gonna discuss this later.

03:46.529 --> 03:49.330
Oh, I know what that means.
Honey, it might mean "yes."

03:49.365 --> 03:51.265
Will it?
No.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.234
Mike...

03:54.269 --> 03:58.605
Honey, what is the harm
in letting her try out?

03:58.639 --> 04:00.607
Really, honey? A teen model?
Yeah.

04:00.641 --> 04:03.377
You want her hanging out
in Vegas with Russian mobsters

04:03.411 --> 04:06.613
and, uh, David Spade?

04:08.582 --> 04:11.117
<i>I absolutely do not want that.</i>

04:13.454 --> 04:14.954
Then why did you say "yes"?

04:14.988 --> 04:16.654
She's 5'1".

04:16.690 --> 04:18.190
She doesn't like people
telling her what to wear.

04:18.225 --> 04:21.260
I think the universe
will take care of this one.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.995
While the universe is trying
to figure it out,

04:23.029 --> 04:24.529
I look like the bad cop.

04:24.564 --> 04:25.763
That's 'cause you're good at it.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.899
That's why we're a great team.

04:27.933 --> 04:30.368
I give 'em freedom.
You set boundaries.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.437
Well, why do I have to
set the boundaries?

04:32.472 --> 04:34.372
I'm freedom.

04:34.407 --> 04:37.142
We both can't be freedom.

04:37.176 --> 04:38.810
It was one thing when
you were traveling around,

04:38.844 --> 04:40.311
but you're home now,

04:40.345 --> 04:42.580
and you can't just swoop in here
and say, "hey, go for it."

04:42.614 --> 04:46.383
Listen, I represent,
you know, truth, justice...

04:46.418 --> 04:49.086
The American way.
I'm Swooperman.

04:54.392 --> 04:57.760
Hey, Mike. You know, I was
just taking a little stroll

04:57.794 --> 05:01.197
down the winter gear section.
Guess what I saw.

05:01.232 --> 05:02.898
Oh, the kayak.

05:02.933 --> 05:05.835
Bingo. So where the hell
are the parkas?

05:05.869 --> 05:07.403
I moved 'em to the center aisle.
The storm's coming.

05:07.438 --> 05:08.571
Figured closer
to the cash register,

05:08.606 --> 05:09.905
we'd sell more of 'em.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.573
I see. Well, I like
the fishing vests

05:11.608 --> 05:13.008
front and center.

05:13.042 --> 05:14.776
It's not fishing season.

05:14.810 --> 05:16.878
Well, I wasn't aware of that.
You wanna know why?

05:16.912 --> 05:19.014
Because you also moved
the calendars.

05:19.048 --> 05:22.584
Listen, Ed, if you don't like
any of this stuff,

05:22.619 --> 05:24.019
just make the call.

05:24.053 --> 05:25.687
Oh, I will. Because I am
the boss, you see.

05:25.721 --> 05:27.122
What's that supposed to mean?

05:27.156 --> 05:28.956
Well, you've been making a lot
of decisions around here lately

05:28.990 --> 05:31.425
without consulting me.
Like what?

05:31.460 --> 05:33.961
Like--like when you fired
Pete from shipping!

05:33.995 --> 05:35.129
Pete was a thief.

05:35.164 --> 05:36.564
Well, you don't know that.

05:36.598 --> 05:37.632
We have video surveillance

05:37.666 --> 05:40.901
showing him taking money
out of your desk.

05:40.935 --> 05:43.003
The poor man
was probably desperate.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.672
Take a look at the video.
The guy's whistling.

05:45.706 --> 05:47.641
And then there was that--
what, that Thursday?

05:47.675 --> 05:49.409
You decided to give
everyone the day off.

05:50.744 --> 05:53.580
Thanksgiving?

05:53.614 --> 05:55.682
You know, you've got
an answer for everything.

05:55.716 --> 05:57.717
This is ridiculous.
You're being just dumb now.

05:57.751 --> 05:59.251
Because I just want you
to remember

05:59.286 --> 06:01.554
that I'm still sitting
in the big chair, see?

06:01.588 --> 06:04.523
By the way, where the hell
is my big chair?

06:04.558 --> 06:05.624
Should have told you--

06:05.659 --> 06:07.326
I sent it out
to get re-upholstered.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.894
You know what? I'll go down
and get you a camp stool,

06:08.928 --> 06:11.897
and maybe a little
admiral's hat for ya.

06:16.034 --> 06:17.468
Hey, you want a sandwich?

06:17.503 --> 06:19.136
Mm, no, thanks, dad,
no carbs for me.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.738
I'm gonna be a model.

06:20.772 --> 06:23.441
And I'm gonna be an astronaut.

06:23.475 --> 06:25.743
It's fun to just say things.

06:27.213 --> 06:29.347
Ha ha ha ha.
No, for your information,

06:29.381 --> 06:32.148
I am auditioning to be
America's next hot teen model.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.917
And mom and dad
are gonna let you do that?

06:33.951 --> 06:35.452
Well, they said
they'd discuss it,

06:35.486 --> 06:37.120
and nobody told me "no."
Right, dad?

06:37.154 --> 06:39.089
I know I didn't.

06:39.123 --> 06:40.657
So you think I have a shot?

06:40.692 --> 06:42.626
If it was meant to be,
it was meant to be.

06:42.660 --> 06:45.229
Ha ha! See? Dad thinks
I'm gonna win it.

06:45.263 --> 06:48.431
Are you sure this is
your native language?

06:48.465 --> 06:49.632
Watch that attitude,

06:49.666 --> 06:52.067
or I'll find someone else
to carry my dog.

06:52.102 --> 06:54.237
(Sighs) Oy.

06:56.039 --> 06:58.307
So you're still letting me
be the bad cop

06:58.342 --> 06:59.775
no one has to be the bad cop.

06:59.809 --> 07:01.110
I totally love and support her,

07:01.144 --> 07:04.178
and I'm absolutely certain
she's gonna fail at this.

07:04.247 --> 07:06.481
That's a very nice sentiment,

07:06.515 --> 07:08.383
but we need to nip this
in the bud,

07:08.417 --> 07:10.084
and you need to tell her
she can't audition.

07:10.119 --> 07:11.953
(Mouth full) I heard you.
I heard you.

07:11.987 --> 07:13.988
I heard what you said.

07:15.658 --> 07:17.692
Slowly forgetting it.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:26.401 --> 07:29.469
So you're sure
you know what you're doing?

07:29.503 --> 07:31.838
Hey, I was the photographer
for my high school paper...

07:31.873 --> 07:33.240
Until I got knocked up

07:33.274 --> 07:35.642
and I had to go to the pregnant
school across the street.

07:35.676 --> 07:38.611
Yeah, Kristin, can we not
bring everyone down right now?

07:38.646 --> 07:40.180
All right.

07:40.214 --> 07:43.049
So my strategy is to show
five sides of my personality.

07:43.084 --> 07:45.684
Eve! Do you have
my shot list?

07:50.456 --> 07:52.491
"Sexy. Super sexy.

07:52.525 --> 07:54.493
"Tease. Vamp.

07:54.527 --> 07:56.662
Sexy from the side."

07:56.696 --> 07:59.531
Well, the girl's got range.

07:59.565 --> 08:03.802
I still think you should go
with this sparkly top.

08:03.836 --> 08:05.303
(Giggles) No.

08:05.337 --> 08:07.571
What about
this red cape-y thing?

08:07.606 --> 08:09.307
(Laughs) No.

08:09.341 --> 08:11.409
You said I could handle
the wardrobe.

08:11.443 --> 08:13.711
<i>No, I said you could
hand me the wardrobe.</i>

08:13.745 --> 08:15.013
Now less talky-talky,

08:15.047 --> 08:16.847
more hanging up the things
I threw on the floor.

08:16.881 --> 08:20.184
Okay, Mandy, you've got
a lot of attitude

08:20.218 --> 08:22.385
for somebody who is one
of 10,000 applicants

08:22.420 --> 08:24.621
to a Colorado
modeling competition.

08:24.655 --> 08:27.090
Whoa. Whoa. I cannot work in
this judgy environment, okay?

08:27.125 --> 08:30.260
I have a dream. You two can
either be near it or not.

08:30.295 --> 08:32.129
(Both) Not.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.830
You'll be sorry!

08:33.864 --> 08:36.198
(Both) No, we won't.

08:36.232 --> 08:40.837
Fine! I'll just do it myself!
It's fine.

08:40.871 --> 08:43.438
Okay.

08:43.472 --> 08:45.674
(Shutter clicks)
Oh, yeah. That's nice.

08:45.709 --> 08:48.377
(Click) Give me another one.
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

08:48.411 --> 08:50.778
(Click) (Laughs)

08:50.813 --> 08:53.381
(Click)
That's great. Yes.

08:53.415 --> 08:55.150
Oh, yeah.

08:55.184 --> 08:57.719
Ooh! I have an idea. Okay.

08:57.753 --> 08:59.821
Oh, yes!
(Click)

08:59.856 --> 09:01.756
Give me another one like that.
Yes! So bad.

09:01.790 --> 09:03.058
(Click)

09:11.499 --> 09:14.501
(Indistinct conversations)

09:15.970 --> 09:18.004
Hey, boss.
Haven't you been busy?

09:18.005 --> 09:19.339
Oh, yes, I have.

09:19.374 --> 09:22.376
Allow me to present
the Outdoor Man Sno-Mo-Bunnies.

09:22.410 --> 09:24.378
The what?

09:24.412 --> 09:25.879
Listen,
you're a marketing genius.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.347
What's the one thing
guaranteed to move product?

09:28.382 --> 09:30.583
Quality merchandise
at a competitive price.

09:30.617 --> 09:32.985
No, siree.
Elevated testosterone levels.

09:33.019 --> 09:36.021
Look, I like a woman in a bikini
as much as the next guy--

09:36.056 --> 09:38.357
not if the next guy is me.

09:38.392 --> 09:40.560
- There's just something about this
that seems a little cheesy.
- Oh.

09:40.594 --> 09:43.195
But you're the boss. Your store.
Do what you want.

09:43.229 --> 09:44.529
Hey, maybe tomorrow
or the next day,

09:44.564 --> 09:46.030
we can get a-a donkey
out front

09:46.065 --> 09:47.599
with a big straw hat
and a cigar.

09:47.633 --> 09:50.702
"Hee-haw!
Why don't you buy stuff?"

09:50.769 --> 09:52.003
You can--you can mock me
all you want,

09:52.037 --> 09:55.507
but these lovely young women
are selling snowmobiles.

09:55.541 --> 09:56.741
They're selling snowmobiles?

09:56.775 --> 09:58.609
14 since noon.

09:58.643 --> 10:00.777
Should we put 'em in heels?

10:03.481 --> 10:06.383
Hey, sweetie.
You talk to your manager?

10:06.418 --> 10:10.020
Um, I-I tried. I tried.

10:10.054 --> 10:12.856
Um, I-I barged into his office,

10:12.890 --> 10:15.858
and I said, "hey!
You owe me a better station,

10:15.892 --> 10:18.461
"because I work hard,
and every day I come in here,

10:18.495 --> 10:21.797
my soul dies a little."

10:21.832 --> 10:24.601
Good, good.
What'd he say?

10:24.635 --> 10:30.639
Nothing. Nothing, because...
He... was... dying... a little.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.407
Literally, mom.
What?

10:32.442 --> 10:34.243
He--yeah. He was--no.
He was choking

10:34.277 --> 10:37.946
on-a chicken bone,
so--so I gave him the Heimlich,

10:37.980 --> 10:40.081
and--and I think
I saved his life.

10:40.116 --> 10:41.650
Wow. Kristin, honey,
that's amazing.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.318
You saved a life!

10:43.353 --> 10:45.053
Yeah, but now I don't
really know how to feel,

10:45.087 --> 10:47.288
because, you know, I went
in there and I was so angry,

10:47.322 --> 10:51.325
and I was so ready to quit,
and now I-I think I'm his hero.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.660
Aw.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.995
Well, honey, he's gotta
treat you better now.

10:55.029 --> 10:58.299
In some cultures,
he'd have to be your slave.

10:58.333 --> 11:01.302
Really, Mike, what cultures?

11:04.238 --> 11:06.306
They're out there.

11:09.510 --> 11:13.713
You guys! My photo shoot went...
(Singsongy) A-mazing.

11:13.748 --> 11:15.214
(Normal voice) So as soon
as Travis approves the photos,

11:15.249 --> 11:16.883
I'm gonna send them off
with the rest of my application,

11:16.917 --> 11:20.018
- which, I might add, kind of rocks.
- What application?

11:20.052 --> 11:21.720
Yeah. Can you believe
you're going to be the mother

11:21.755 --> 11:22.888
of a top teen model?

11:22.922 --> 11:25.324
Ooh! Just don't go all
Dina Lohan on me.

11:25.358 --> 11:28.860
What was that? You said
you were gonna talk to her.

11:28.895 --> 11:31.797
<i>Well, then I had a better idea
to not talk to her.</i>

11:31.831 --> 11:33.632
How is that a better idea?

11:33.667 --> 11:34.732
Because if we don't
let her audition,

11:34.767 --> 11:36.367
she's still
gonna have this dream,

11:36.402 --> 11:38.035
but if we let
the universe say "no,"

11:38.069 --> 11:40.905
it'll crush
this bad idea forever.

11:40.939 --> 11:43.808
Oh, my God, Mandy, you can't
send these photos in.

11:43.842 --> 11:45.677
Girls! What's all
the yelling about?

11:45.711 --> 11:47.412
Kristin doesn't like my photos.

11:47.446 --> 11:48.846
Yeah, well, you won't either.
What's the matter with them?

11:48.880 --> 11:51.448
Too backlit? Too blurry?
Underexposed?

11:51.482 --> 11:52.749
Overexposed.

11:52.784 --> 11:54.351
What the heck are you thinking?

11:54.385 --> 11:55.786
Dad, don't make this a thing.

11:55.820 --> 11:57.220
- What are you thinking? Look at the--
- Mike, hon--

11:57.254 --> 12:00.290
oh! Where is your top?!

12:00.325 --> 12:02.192
I don't get it.
Nobody likes the photo.

12:02.226 --> 12:03.627
I'd like it if you were
wearing a turtleneck,

12:03.661 --> 12:05.329
not your hands.

12:05.363 --> 12:06.796
You don't understand fashion.

12:06.830 --> 12:08.263
I understand fashion
has something to do

12:08.298 --> 12:10.399
with wearing clothes,
but you aren't wearing any!

12:10.434 --> 12:12.335
You can't see anything!

12:12.369 --> 12:14.002
You can see under-boob.

12:14.037 --> 12:16.905
Oh, lord, strike me blind.

12:16.940 --> 12:19.107
I don't understand.
What--what is the big deal?

12:19.142 --> 12:20.943
I've seen the girls
on your classic car calendar.

12:20.977 --> 12:22.478
Sometimes they don't even
have cars!

12:22.512 --> 12:23.478
That has nothing to do
with this!

12:23.512 --> 12:24.479
Those aren't my daughters!

12:24.513 --> 12:25.480
They're somebody's daughters!

12:25.514 --> 12:26.715
We don't know that!

12:26.749 --> 12:30.118
Mandy...
Mandy, this is a big deal.

12:30.153 --> 12:31.720
What if somebody saw those?

12:31.754 --> 12:32.754
Well, then we would have

12:32.788 --> 12:34.923
a new most embarrassing
Baxter daughter.

12:34.958 --> 12:36.225
(Mouths words)

12:36.259 --> 12:39.227
I think you guys need privacy.

12:39.261 --> 12:41.562
Listen, you're young
and you're naive,

12:41.596 --> 12:43.397
and this may seem like
something harmless to you,

12:43.431 --> 12:45.032
but once these pictures
get out, you can't get 'em back.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.700
This could haunt you
the rest of your life.

12:46.735 --> 12:48.336
Let's say you ran
for political office.

12:48.370 --> 12:50.338
Mike, just--no.

12:50.372 --> 12:52.840
All right. Forget that.

12:52.875 --> 12:55.842
Look, honey, the point is,

12:55.877 --> 12:59.379
the mistakes that we make
as young people can't be erased.

12:59.413 --> 13:00.914
Whether it's a photograph
like this,

13:00.948 --> 13:02.815
or an embarrassing tattoo...
Mike.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.754
Listen, I'm gonna take
the memory card

13:07.788 --> 13:09.222
and get rid of these.

13:09.257 --> 13:10.857
Fine, go ahead. I'll just have
Travis text them back to me.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.657
Travis has seen these?

13:12.692 --> 13:14.393
- Probably not yet. He has a
trombone lesson till 8:00.
- Ugh.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.128
So there's a chance
he hasn't shared them

13:16.162 --> 13:17.897
with 4,000
of his closest friends?

13:17.931 --> 13:19.198
Mom, Travis wouldn't do that.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.133
No, no.
'Cause he's a 17-year-old boy,

13:21.167 --> 13:23.502
- and they are notoriously trustworthy.
- Come on.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.138
Always trustworthy.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.179
(Doorbell rings)

13:34.299 --> 13:36.419
Hey, hi there.
Is Travis home?

13:36.453 --> 13:37.553
Who are you?

13:37.587 --> 13:39.588
Mike Baxter.
(Trombone playing in distance)

13:39.623 --> 13:41.024
Outdoor man.

13:41.058 --> 13:43.759
Mandy's dad! Hi!

13:43.794 --> 13:45.428
I'm Kim.

13:45.462 --> 13:47.729
- Oh, I am so happy to meet you.
- Well, good.

13:47.763 --> 13:48.997
I've been trying to get
our families together

13:49.032 --> 13:50.565
for a meal for so long.

13:50.599 --> 13:52.701
Well, we're busy, and we have
a lot of food allergies.

13:52.768 --> 13:56.271
Anyway, um, is Travis home?

13:56.306 --> 13:59.708
He's in his trombone intensive.
Can I help you?

13:59.742 --> 14:02.310
Well, this is just going
to be a little awkward.

14:02.344 --> 14:05.179
Look, it turns out that
Mandy may have sent him

14:05.214 --> 14:07.348
some provocative pictures
on his cell phone.

14:07.382 --> 14:08.316
(Trombone warbles, stops)

14:08.350 --> 14:09.550
Pornography?

14:10.853 --> 14:12.686
Well, I wouldn't say
pornography.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.121
It's more of a, uh...

14:14.156 --> 14:15.990
If you were to shoot, um...

14:16.024 --> 14:18.391
Um, oh, God help me,

14:18.425 --> 14:20.994
uh, under-boob.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.963
(Trombone resumes playing)
If I could just see his phone,
I can delete them,

14:22.997 --> 14:23.964
and I'd be out of here.

14:23.998 --> 14:25.298
It's--it's right here.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.734
Ugh! I can't believe this.
Oh, thank you so much.

14:27.768 --> 14:30.103
I never should have
let Travis see Mandy.

14:30.137 --> 14:33.439
The apple doesn't fall far
from the big sister.

14:33.474 --> 14:35.640
What's the heck that
supposed to mean?

14:35.675 --> 14:38.377
I'll tell you one thing your
daughters aren't allergic to--

14:38.411 --> 14:39.945
loose morals.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.681
Wow. Do we have
a lot of nerve, Kim?

14:42.715 --> 14:43.849
I've got a lot of nerve?

14:43.884 --> 14:45.450
You're the one standing
in my living room

14:45.485 --> 14:46.585
holding my son's cell phone,

14:46.652 --> 14:50.454
which is now jam-packed
full of pornography.

14:50.489 --> 14:52.290
It's just so dirty.

14:52.324 --> 14:54.225
Yes, it--it does
appear to be dirty.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.262
Let's--let's give it
a little bath.

14:57.296 --> 14:59.530
You've ruined his phone.

14:59.564 --> 15:01.199
Yes, I guess
I'm sorry about that.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.134
Here, buy him a new phone.

15:03.168 --> 15:04.702
And try raising three daughters

15:04.736 --> 15:06.436
while you're pointing
your little finger there.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.605
It's a pain in the ass.

15:11.042 --> 15:14.011
(Indistinct conversations)

15:14.045 --> 15:16.446
<i>(Piano playing)</i>

15:16.480 --> 15:18.548
Hi, . Baxter.

15:18.582 --> 15:21.184
Hi. I know you.

15:21.219 --> 15:22.451
I'm April.

15:22.485 --> 15:24.153
Which calendar?

15:24.187 --> 15:25.521
No. April Miller.

15:25.555 --> 15:27.689
I went to school
with your daughter Kristin.

15:27.724 --> 15:29.158
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:29.192 --> 15:31.827
Yeah, I-I know your dad.
He's, um...

15:31.895 --> 15:32.962
He's a mechanic.

15:32.996 --> 15:34.363
And a good guy, too.

15:34.398 --> 15:36.198
Well, you've grown--
you've grown up, you know?

15:36.233 --> 15:37.233
Yeah.

15:39.402 --> 15:42.404
(Camera shutter clicking)

15:47.709 --> 15:50.078
Mike...

15:50.112 --> 15:54.014
Mike, what's going on?
Where are my Sno-Mo-Bunnies?

15:54.049 --> 15:55.515
I sent 'em home, Ed.

15:55.550 --> 15:57.651
I thought I made it clear
I don't wanna be second-guessed.

15:57.685 --> 15:59.420
How many snowmobiles
can you sell?

15:59.454 --> 16:01.288
All of them.

16:01.323 --> 16:04.024
That's what we do.
Now get the girls back.

16:04.059 --> 16:05.659
No.
I'm not asking.

16:05.693 --> 16:07.794
Half-naked girls
running around downstairs?

16:07.829 --> 16:09.896
That's not what Outdoor Man
is all about.

16:09.931 --> 16:12.765
Wait--wait a minute. Don't tell
me what Outdoor Man is about.

16:12.799 --> 16:14.733
<i>I am Outdoor Man.</i>

16:14.768 --> 16:16.669
Well, when I came on board,
you had one store--

16:16.703 --> 16:18.604
Ed's fishin' hole.
Now you have 20.

16:18.638 --> 16:20.206
I'd like to think
I'm part of that.

16:22.142 --> 16:23.742
Well, forget it!
I'm not going anywhere!

16:23.777 --> 16:25.078
Nobody's taking over, Ed!

16:25.112 --> 16:26.311
What's the matter with you?

16:26.346 --> 16:29.714
(Clears throat)
I had a birthday last week.

16:29.748 --> 16:33.118
So what?
I forget every year.

16:33.152 --> 16:36.821
Well, now I'm the same age
my father was when he retired,

16:36.856 --> 16:39.424
and retirement killed him.

16:39.459 --> 16:40.925
Well, actually,

16:40.960 --> 16:45.562
the husband of the lady
he was seeing killed him.

16:45.597 --> 16:49.233
But he wouldn't have been seeing
her if he had been at work.

16:49.267 --> 16:52.903
Ed, no one's suggesting
that you retire.

16:52.937 --> 16:54.038
Don't kid a kidder.

16:54.072 --> 16:55.039
You've been changing things
around here.

16:55.073 --> 16:56.040
You've been going your own way.

16:56.108 --> 16:57.808
Now you send the girls home?

16:57.842 --> 16:59.976
That's different.
I know one of those girls.

17:00.011 --> 17:02.178
I know her dad.
That's somebody's daughter.

17:02.213 --> 17:03.913
They're all
somebody's daughters.

17:03.947 --> 17:08.818
Sounds like the worst
country song ever written.

17:08.852 --> 17:12.922
Listen, you're my best friend,
you're my mentor,

17:12.955 --> 17:14.823
and most of all, Ed,
you're my boss.

17:14.857 --> 17:16.224
This is your place.

17:16.259 --> 17:18.859
Nothing's gonna change,
all right?

17:18.895 --> 17:21.329
All right. Okay, Mike.
All right, listen.

17:21.364 --> 17:23.632
- But I'm not gonna hug you, okay?
- Okay.

17:23.665 --> 17:25.300
(Laughs) Uh, but somehow,

17:25.335 --> 17:27.169
shaking hands doesn't seem
quite enough, you know? It's...

17:27.203 --> 17:28.404
Well, it is for me.

17:28.471 --> 17:30.138
Yeah.

17:30.172 --> 17:31.506
Ahh! There we go.

17:31.540 --> 17:33.774
Let's do it again.
Oh! Oh. At's just--

17:33.808 --> 17:34.909
one more time.

17:34.943 --> 17:40.048
Okay! That was enough.
That was enough.

17:40.082 --> 17:43.217
<i>I still can't believe
all those horrible things</i>

17:43.252 --> 17:46.020
Travis' mother said
about my daughters.

17:46.054 --> 17:48.388
Oh, she is lucky
I wasn't there.

17:48.423 --> 17:51.558
Wow. Well, there's nothing
you would have done

17:51.592 --> 17:53.026
that I didn't do.

17:53.061 --> 17:54.961
I would have cut her.

17:54.995 --> 17:56.496
(Crunches)

18:00.468 --> 18:04.136
It's probably a good thing
you didn't go over there.

18:04.171 --> 18:06.905
(Sighs heavily)

18:06.940 --> 18:08.740
Well, another day in paradise.

18:08.775 --> 18:11.743
We had three tables
dine and dash,

18:11.778 --> 18:12.911
one of our refrigerators
went out,

18:12.946 --> 18:15.047
and a customer chipped a tooth

18:15.082 --> 18:16.582
on a tooth.

18:16.616 --> 18:18.683
(Both laugh)

18:18.717 --> 18:22.420
- So did your super-grateful
boss give you a raise?
- Nope.

18:22.455 --> 18:25.123
- Did he move you to a better station?
- No.

18:25.157 --> 18:27.392
What do you say you and I
go back in an hour

18:27.426 --> 18:30.095
and put that chicken bone
back in his throat?

18:30.129 --> 18:32.630
Right. Um...

18:32.664 --> 18:33.598
He gave me this.

18:33.632 --> 18:35.031
This is...

18:35.066 --> 18:37.201
It's a photo
of his 5-year-old son.

18:37.235 --> 18:39.103
Oh.
Oh. He's cute.

18:39.137 --> 18:40.937
Yeah. He said
if not for me,

18:40.972 --> 18:42.372
this boy wouldn't
have a father.

18:42.407 --> 18:44.374
And, uh, it made me realize

18:44.409 --> 18:46.009
that years from now,

18:46.043 --> 18:50.179
I'm gonna look back
at this stupid diner job

18:50.214 --> 18:52.348
and I'm gonna think, wow,

18:52.382 --> 18:54.850
I guess it wasn't a waste.

18:54.884 --> 18:58.053
You're a good kid.
I'm very proud of you.

18:58.088 --> 18:59.622
Yeah.

18:59.656 --> 19:02.158
I still think a raise
would have been nice.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.161
(Mouth full)
Well, thanks for nothing, dad.

19:05.195 --> 19:08.396
Now I'm not gonna be
America's next hot teen model,

19:08.431 --> 19:11.833
which was my gateway
to "dancing with the stars."

19:13.136 --> 19:15.770
Which was her gateway
to "celebrity rehab."

19:18.741 --> 19:20.942
I'm disappointed in all of you!

19:20.976 --> 19:24.311
In no particular order--
dad, mom, and Kristin!

19:24.346 --> 19:25.912
Wait, what did I do?

19:25.947 --> 19:27.515
Exactly!

19:27.549 --> 19:28.982
Wow.

19:29.017 --> 19:31.418
(Groans) So this is what it feels like
to disappoint your daughter?

19:31.453 --> 19:32.786
Yeah.
But you get used to it.

19:32.820 --> 19:35.356
<i>No, I kind of like it.
It makes me feel alive.</i>

19:35.390 --> 19:38.258
Yeah?
So no more good cop/bad cop?

19:38.292 --> 19:40.460
Just two old cops
walking the beat,

19:40.494 --> 19:41.927
too old to care about anything

19:41.962 --> 19:44.597
except eating doughnuts,
drinking coffee,

19:44.632 --> 19:45.665
waiting for our pension.

19:45.699 --> 19:48.168
Mm. Sounds good to me.

19:48.202 --> 19:49.602
Hey, uh...

19:49.637 --> 19:52.972
You wanna do it?

19:54.307 --> 19:56.074
You mean go get doughnuts?

19:56.108 --> 19:56.975
Yeah.

19:57.009 --> 19:59.211
I was actually thinking of...

19:59.245 --> 20:00.212
Doughnuts would be good.

20:00.246 --> 20:02.614
Yeah! Let's.

20:07.970 --> 20:10.804
(All) Surprise!

20:10.839 --> 20:13.006
What--what the hell is this?
What's going on?

20:13.041 --> 20:14.875
Happy belated birthday, boss.

20:14.909 --> 20:17.510
It's actually
a Bar Mitzvah cake

20:17.545 --> 20:21.615
that someone didn't pick up
at the bakery, so...

20:21.649 --> 20:23.784
Mazel tov!

20:23.818 --> 20:26.853
You shouldn't have.
Ah, it wasn't a big deal.

20:26.887 --> 20:28.554
No, act-actually,
you shouldn't have.

20:28.588 --> 20:30.604
You know, it's a company rule.
We don't do birthdays, you know?

20:30.724 --> 20:32.825
I mean, we'd have to do
about a hundred of them,

20:32.860 --> 20:34.794
then I'd have to memorize
everybody's names.

20:34.828 --> 20:36.362
Well, we thought we'd, uh,

20:36.396 --> 20:38.564
bend the rules a little bit
for the boss.

20:38.598 --> 20:41.400
Yeah, well, you'll do anything
to usurp me, huh, Mike?

20:41.434 --> 20:42.368
You bet I will.

20:42.402 --> 20:43.635
Yeah.

20:43.669 --> 20:44.669
Huh?

20:44.703 --> 20:47.005
(Man cheers)

20:48.775 --> 20:52.443
Hey. Isn't that lovely?
My own chair.

20:52.478 --> 20:56.514
Why don't you give me a gift
certificate to my own store?

20:56.548 --> 20:57.949
How about--why don't you

20:57.984 --> 21:00.751
why don't you wrap up
my own shoes?

21:00.786 --> 21:02.486
Hey, why don't you put--

21:02.520 --> 21:06.623
here, put this--this ribbon
right on top of my own car.

21:06.658 --> 21:09.493
Tell you what--why don't you
stuff me in a gift box

21:09.527 --> 21:11.628
and mail me to myself?
