You forgot to buy toilet paper!

00:11.000 --> 00:14.959
Seriously,
what kind of mom are you?

00:14.960 --> 00:17.039
Well, look, I just got home
from Ben's.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.999

like I used to.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.119
We don't have phone books
anymore.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.790
It's not the 1800s, Nana.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.080
Does anyone realize
we're out of toilet paper?

00:29.460 --> 00:32.539
I cannot go at school.
There's no doors on the stalls.

00:32.540 --> 00:33.920
This is a problem.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.919
If you can't wait, can't you
just use Kleenex or a napkin?

00:38.920 --> 00:43.079
No, because we use toilet paper
for both those things.

This place sucks!

your life together.

Whoa.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.749
I didn't take you to a doctor
for seven years,

00:49.750 --> 00:51.829

over toilet paper?

What's your problem?

00:53.620 --> 00:55.669
You're my problem.

00:55.670 --> 00:57.170
Hurry home.
Miss you.

00:59.420 --> 01:01.579
I was so happy when you had kids

01:01.580 --> 01:03.790
because I knew
we'd be here one day.

01:06.210 --> 01:08.039
You know what?
I don't get it.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.829
I mean, Harris and I fight,
but right now,

01:09.830 --> 01:11.749
she's being so angry
and sarcastic.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.550
I mean, that doesn't run
in our family at all.

01:15.790 --> 01:18.169
Could be anything.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.419
You know we're out of
toilet paper, right?

01:19.420 --> 01:20.830
Walk away, old man.

01:23.830 --> 01:25.329
I'm assuming you're Joanna,

01:25.330 --> 01:27.379
although she was supposed
to be here at 10:00,

01:27.380 --> 01:28.959
and it's 10:05,

01:28.960 --> 01:32.079
so it's hard to say.

How you feeling?
You look like hell.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.619
It's hard to look glamorous

01:47.750 --> 01:49.669
Becky, go home
and get some sleep.

01:49.670 --> 01:50.709
We'll stay with the baby.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.119
Alright.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.829
I'll leave after
the night nurse takes over.

01:53.830 --> 01:54.790
I like her.

01:54.791 --> 01:56.539
I'll take the first shift.
Great.

01:56.540 --> 01:57.540

01:57.541 --> 01:58.579
I'll tell you
what you did wrong,

01:58.580 --> 01:59.829
I'll fix it,

01:59.830 --> 02:00.879
and I'll make a training manual

02:00.880 --> 02:02.289
so it never happens again.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.579
Hey, Jackie,

02:03.580 --> 02:04.879
could you go down
to the cafeteria

02:04.880 --> 02:06.959
and get me a grilled cheese?
I'm starved.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.579
How about we change
the grilled cheese

02:08.580 --> 02:10.669
to a spinach salad...
Lots of iron.

02:10.669 --> 02:13.499
And some orange juice will
help you absorb the iron.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.999
- Sure.
- I'll take the grilled cheese.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.379
And a Coke to help me
absorb the cheese.

02:18.380 --> 02:20.209
Thank you!

02:20.210 --> 02:22.079
You're an angel!

02:22.080 --> 02:24.879
Get her out of here.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.829
This morning, she was
walking around the incubator,

02:26.830 --> 02:28.119
snapping her fingers

02:28.120 --> 02:31.169
to see if the baby
has directional hearing.

02:31.170 --> 02:33.039
Alright, we just have
to be delicate with her.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.079
Her life blew up,
and she's looking

02:35.080 --> 02:37.669
for some kind of purpose
for herself through our lives.

02:37.670 --> 02:40.249

And if I just sit
every couple minutes,

10:15.620 --> 10:17.289
the dizziness goes away.

10:17.290 --> 10:18.919
You should not be here.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.079
No, I should not.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.249
But I have a kid coming home
any day now,

10:23.250 --> 10:26.459
and that means rent,
bills, baby supplies...

10:26.460 --> 10:27.959
Excuse me?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.959
I'm sorry, I can't quite read
what this says.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.289
It says, "I'm Becky.

10:32.290 --> 10:34.919
I just had a four-pound baby.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.459
The father, Emilio,
a poor busboy,

10:37.460 --> 10:39.209
was deported to Mexico."

10:39.210 --> 10:41.460
But leave whatever you feel
is appropriate.

10:48.670 --> 10:51.289
Two lousy bucks?

10:51.290 --> 10:53.789
I owe the hospital hundreds
of thousands of dollars,

10:53.790 --> 10:55.999
and I am totally on my own.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.079
Let me have your wallets!
All of you!

10:58.080 --> 11:00.419
Becky, stop.

11:00.420 --> 11:02.079
Fine.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.999
Oh!

11:04.000 --> 11:06.379
Well, thank you, Becky.

11:06.380 --> 11:08.749
Wonderful.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.919
You know, we are kinda new
to the dinner-theater thing.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.040
Let us know how we're doing.

11:19.460 --> 11:21.119
Good time to talk?

11:21.120 --> 11:23.670
Not really, but whatever.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.879
Okay.

11:26.880 --> 11:30.539
So, today, I was at the NICU,

11:30.540 --> 11:33.499
and little Beverly Rose
grabbed my finger,

11:33.500 --> 11:34.959
and she squeezed it,

11:34.960 --> 11:37.209
and it... it made me remember

11:37.210 --> 11:39.249
how you always
used to hold my hand

11:39.250 --> 11:41.669
and how close we were.

11:41.670 --> 11:44.920
And now you're,
you know, insane.

11:47.250 --> 11:51.669
So, if there's something
that you want to tell me

11:51.670 --> 11:53.579
that's bothering you,
I'd love to hear it.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.619
Sure.

11:54.620 --> 11:56.379
Here's what's bothering me.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.710
I know that you're having sex
with Dad and Ben.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.210
And you're lying about it
to both of them.

12:04.330 --> 12:05.920
Wow.

12:09.460 --> 12:10.709
How'd you find out?

12:10.710 --> 12:12.249
I saw Dad coming out of
your bedroom

12:12.250 --> 12:13.420
in the middle of the night.

12:14.710 --> 12:16.459
Look, I'm really sorry.

12:16.460 --> 12:17.499
I don't wanna hear it.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.169
You're a liar,

12:19.170 --> 12:21.709
and I have no reason to believe
anything you say ever again.

12:21.710 --> 12:23.879
No, you have to give me
a chance to explain.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.919
You got a text.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.709
This is more important.

12:27.710 --> 12:29.829
But it might be from Ben or Dad

12:29.830 --> 12:31.249
or someone you met

12:31.250 --> 12:33.670
driving back and forth
between Ben and Dad.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.920
Well, now you're just giving me
too much credit.

12:41.540 --> 12:43.249
Damn it.
It's Grandpa.

12:43.250 --> 12:46.079
Becky's freaking out
at Casita Bonita.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.329
Look, I gotta go,
but when I get back,

12:48.330 --> 12:50.209
please just give me a chance
to tell you what's going on.

12:50.210 --> 12:51.329
It's really complicated.

12:51.330 --> 12:52.619
No, it's not.

12:52.620 --> 12:54.669
Stop screwing my dad over,

12:54.670 --> 12:56.669
or I'm gonna call him
and tell him what's going on.

12:56.670 --> 12:58.669
You know, it's...
It's very sweet

12:58.670 --> 13:00.169
that you're looking out for him,

13:00.170 --> 13:02.119
but just remember one thing...

13:02.120 --> 13:03.790
He abandoned you.
I'm just saying.

13:07.790 --> 13:09.329
Where's Becky?

13:09.330 --> 13:11.329
Oh, she's back here.

13:11.330 --> 13:13.670
She's not in a good place.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.329
Hey.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.619
Look at you,

13:18.620 --> 13:21.789
sitting on a bucket
behind a bar.

13:21.790 --> 13:24.959
I see it all so clearly now.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.249
Even if I work,

13:26.250 --> 13:28.959
every dime will go to childcare.

13:28.960 --> 13:32.289
So I've decided to let
the hospital keep Lil Bev.

13:32.290 --> 13:35.209
Uh-huh.

13:35.210 --> 13:38.789
They've got a cafeteria,
so she'll eat good,

13:38.790 --> 13:41.249
and I can watch her from afar
in the kids' play area.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.080
I've seen that in the movies.

13:44.380 --> 13:46.460
Well, clearly,
I rushed down here for nothing.

13:48.290 --> 13:49.539
You know what?

13:49.540 --> 13:51.829
You're gonna come home,
you're gonna live rent-free,

13:51.830 --> 13:53.999
where people can help you.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.209
But if I move back in,

13:55.210 --> 13:56.879
I'm just admitting
I couldn't make it on my own

13:56.880 --> 13:59.079
and I'm just a big, fat loser.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.540
That's what I did.
It's very freeing.

14:03.620 --> 14:05.499
Hey, bud.
How was work?

14:05.500 --> 14:08.080
I'm not afraid of you.

14:09.790 --> 14:11.919
Everything is gonna be okay.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.709
Becky's gonna come home
and live with us for awhile.

14:13.710 --> 14:16.079
Good!
That starts now.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.419
Grab her coat,
and take her back to the house.

14:18.420 --> 14:22.039
Hey, I am not totally
giving up my independence here.

14:22.040 --> 14:25.329
I will grab my own coat.

14:25.330 --> 14:26.879
Okay.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.669
Let me help you to the car,

14:28.670 --> 14:31.169
and then I'll come
back in here real quick

14:31.170 --> 14:32.250
and grab some toilet paper.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.539
Thank you so much for calling.

14:37.540 --> 14:40.379
Well, Becky needed help.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.120
I'm not family, but I care.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.040
Look, I got an idea.

14:45.041 --> 14:47.329
I'm heading back
to the hospital,

14:47.330 --> 14:49.619
and yeah,
it's kinda depressing...

14:49.620 --> 14:52.829
All those babies
hooked up to tubes,

14:52.830 --> 14:53.960
barely clinging to life.

Yep.

She gets that from me.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.999
Good news, buddy.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.079
You're coming to live
at Grandpa's house for awhile.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.879
It's not much...

15:44.880 --> 15:46.669
Actually,
it'd need a major remodel

15:46.670 --> 15:48.879
for it to be
"not much."

15:48.880 --> 15:52.209
Hey, the fact
that you have a house

15:52.210 --> 15:54.539
for your struggling daughter
and her baby

15:54.540 --> 15:58.459
and your other struggling
daughter and her two kids

15:58.460 --> 16:00.880
just proves
you're a good provider.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.670
It's not much of a motivator.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.250
You know, Rose...

16:14.210 --> 16:15.710
It's okay.

16:18.580 --> 16:21.459
I'm so sorry.

16:21.460 --> 16:24.460
I just... I feel
so comfortable with you.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.669
You don't have to apologize

16:27.670 --> 16:29.999
for feeling comfortable with me.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.709
Listen,
I haven't kept it a secret

16:32.710 --> 16:34.709
how hard this is for me,

16:34.710 --> 16:36.249
but you have to know
how much I like you,

16:36.250 --> 16:38.120
and... and I wanna
spend time with you.

16:40.830 --> 16:45.249
What do you say
we start hanging out...

16:45.250 --> 16:46.669
on a regular basis,

16:46.670 --> 16:49.169
and I'll throw in dinner
once a week?

16:49.170 --> 16:51.879
Like dates?

16:51.880 --> 16:55.079
Like hanging out
and having dinner once a week.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.209
Slow down, cowboy.

16:57.210 --> 16:59.619
It's moving
a little fast for me.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.669
But...
I can work with that.

17:02.670 --> 17:05.289
Well, you're only human.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.170
I know you want some of this.

17:08.829 --> 17:11.709
I can be patient.

17:11.710 --> 17:13.959
But when I come for it,

17:13.960 --> 17:16.669
I don't want some of it.

17:16.670 --> 17:18.419
I want all of it.

17:18.420 --> 17:19.960
You don't have that kinda time.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.750
I brought you a peace offering.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.120
Go ahead. Instagram all
your friends. I'll wait.

17:39.620 --> 17:43.749

any of this.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.459
Well, you've gotta decide.

17:45.460 --> 17:46.829
It's not fair to Dad.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.879
Hey, I love your dad,

17:48.880 --> 17:50.829
and the last thing I want to do
is hurt him,

17:50.830 --> 17:52.619
but this is a hard decision.

17:52.620 --> 17:54.749
I-It affects all of us.

17:54.750 --> 17:57.039
I've got to figure out
who's gonna make us happy

17:57.040 --> 17:59.879
and who's gonna keep us
in toilet paper.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.879
So, what am I supposed to do?

18:01.880 --> 18:04.619
Just keep this giant secret
while you figure it out?

The lights are
from Christmas decorations,

20:04.790 --> 20:06.329
Mark did the mural on the wall,

20:06.330 --> 20:07.919
and I picked out the bedspread.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.880
I hope that's a solution
and not a problem.

Hey, I'm just noticing
