01:44.370 --> 01:45.905
You've reached
Professor Felix Fojas,

01:45.938 --> 01:46.805
please leave a message.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.677
Hi Felix, it's Amanda.

01:52.745 --> 01:54.547
I didn't know who else to call.

01:54.579 --> 01:57.316
I don't feel like myself,
I can't explain it.

01:58.349 --> 02:00.253
Things have been happening.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.722
Strange things.

02:02.754 --> 02:04.623
So will you call me please?

02:09.594 --> 02:11.764
I wish I'd handled
things better between us.

03:14.425 --> 03:15.294
Thane?

03:23.968 --> 03:25.337
Sarah?

03:35.913 --> 03:36.782
Sarah?

03:45.056 --> 03:47.859
Honey, are you okay?

03:58.403 --> 03:59.972
Why are you hiding from me?

04:00.004 --> 04:01.073
No, what
are you talking about?

04:01.105 --> 04:03.308
I'm in the car with dad,
we'll be home soon, okay.

04:03.342 --> 04:05.678
Welcome home!

04:05.711 --> 04:06.646
There's someone in the house.

04:06.679 --> 04:07.646
Mom, what
are you talking about?

04:07.680 --> 04:08.581
Someone's in the house?

04:13.585 --> 04:16.555
Knox County
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

04:38.343 --> 04:39.144
What's going on?

04:39.177 --> 04:40.612
- I don't know.
- What's happening?

04:41.680 --> 04:42.548
Daddy?

04:45.416 --> 04:46.351
Where's my wife?

04:47.452 --> 04:49.387
What happened, where is she?

04:49.420 --> 04:50.122
- Doctor.
- Where's my wife?

04:50.154 --> 04:51.657
- Doctor.
- Where's my wife!

04:53.358 --> 04:54.826
Your daughter
should stay here.

04:54.860 --> 04:55.995
Deputy Mullins, stay
with the young lady.

04:56.028 --> 04:57.530
- Come on Thane.
- No.

04:57.562 --> 04:58.363
- Stay here!
- No, no, no, no!

04:58.396 --> 05:01.600
Stay here!

05:14.747 --> 05:16.482
Hey! Hey!

05:16.514 --> 05:17.382
Stop!

05:25.723 --> 05:26.658
Detective.

05:28.459 --> 05:29.527
Doctor.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.629
Where is...

05:31.797 --> 05:33.099
I am sorry.

05:36.735 --> 05:37.970
I'm sorry.

05:38.002 --> 05:39.471
Mom, mom, mom!

05:41.607 --> 05:43.142
No, no, daddy, daddy!

05:43.175 --> 05:44.643
Look at me, look at me.

05:44.675 --> 05:45.610
Look at me.

06:01.192 --> 06:02.060
Sheriff.

06:10.968 --> 06:12.671
Doctor, who's Felix Fojas?

08:42.854 --> 08:43.923
Doing great.

08:45.990 --> 08:48.826
Wow, aren't you a big
girl, let's try this one.

08:54.332 --> 08:55.201
Dr. Noles.

08:57.068 --> 08:58.103
Oh.

08:58.136 --> 09:00.038
This is for helping
Isaac with his cataracts.

09:00.739 --> 09:02.942
And this is for helping Ruth.

09:05.943 --> 09:08.079
Did you help bake
these treats young lady?

09:09.947 --> 09:10.982
Well, I have to tell ya,

09:11.015 --> 09:12.918
this is the best
gift I've been given

09:12.951 --> 09:13.920
in quite some time.

09:18.923 --> 09:21.626
Your family's in
our prayers doctor.

09:21.659 --> 09:22.562
You're a good man.

09:23.394 --> 09:25.663
God has a heart for good men.

09:25.697 --> 09:27.131
Thank you ma'am.

10:53.818 --> 10:55.420
Sampson, come back!

10:56.421 --> 10:57.289
Sampson!

12:27.511 --> 12:29.114
Keep the change.

12:34.820 --> 12:35.488
Hi.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.307
Stop, I'm serious!

12:57.875 --> 12:59.244
I have a daughter.

12:59.277 --> 13:01.847
Please, we
can make this work.

13:01.879 --> 13:03.282
- I'm sorry.
- I love you.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.205
This is
private property.

15:06.672 --> 15:10.075
I'm Felix Fojas,
I knew Amanda.

15:15.245 --> 15:16.148
Professor Fojas.

15:21.186 --> 15:22.220
Look at me.

15:22.253 --> 15:23.187
Look at me!

15:25.190 --> 15:27.526
Do you have any idea what
you did to my family?

15:28.659 --> 15:29.528
Huh!

15:31.229 --> 15:32.364
Dad?

15:40.605 --> 15:42.975
You got five seconds
to leave my property.

15:53.784 --> 15:57.288
Daddy!

16:06.764 --> 16:08.100
Call Father Olawale.

16:44.635 --> 16:47.238
Christina!

16:47.272 --> 16:48.073
Good morning.

16:48.105 --> 16:50.042
Now why are you
sitting alone here

16:50.075 --> 16:51.543
in the dark when
the Lord has made

16:51.576 --> 16:53.211
us such a beautiful day!

16:54.678 --> 16:57.381
I know, I know your
mother wouldn't want you

16:57.414 --> 17:00.384
sitting here alone
lost in that computer.

17:00.418 --> 17:03.389
How would you know
what my mother wanted?

17:06.257 --> 17:07.125
That hurt.

17:09.294 --> 17:10.396
Now blood or not,

17:11.627 --> 17:14.531
you are my daughter.

17:15.232 --> 17:17.568
I didn't ask for your opinion.

17:17.602 --> 17:19.271
If you knew what it
took for your Mother

17:19.304 --> 17:22.540
and I to become married
and to make us a family,

17:22.574 --> 17:23.442
it's all for you!

17:23.473 --> 17:25.276
Mother wanted to fix me!

17:25.309 --> 17:28.346
She tried to fix me, not you!

17:28.377 --> 17:31.782
When your mother's cancer
came back, she was lost.

17:31.816 --> 17:35.153
Get out!

17:35.185 --> 17:36.054
Out!

17:51.469 --> 17:52.437
I'm guessing
you worked all the leads

17:52.470 --> 17:54.873
on that robbery since
it's been over a week?

17:54.905 --> 17:56.642
Not
every single one.

17:59.243 --> 18:02.113
Will you get Felix
Fojas on the phone Nita?

18:02.146 --> 18:03.781
Number should be
in the Noles file.

18:03.815 --> 18:05.683
Professor Fojas

18:06.584 --> 18:08.586
is waiting in your office,

18:08.619 --> 18:10.488
says he wants to speak with you.

18:17.494 --> 18:21.832
Professor Fojas,
you must be psychic.

18:21.865 --> 18:23.501
No, just a third eye.

18:23.535 --> 18:25.571
Yeah, I got a cousin
with a sixth toe.

18:27.271 --> 18:29.540
I suppose that's
neither here nor there.

18:29.574 --> 18:30.408
Coffee?

18:30.441 --> 18:31.910
No, thank you.

18:31.942 --> 18:35.180
So, my deputy said you were
in California when we phoned,

18:35.212 --> 18:36.748
now I find you in my office.

18:36.780 --> 18:38.450
Assumed you had questions.

18:38.482 --> 18:39.717
As do I.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.421
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

18:43.820 --> 18:46.524
What exactly was the nature

18:46.557 --> 18:49.161
of your relationship
with Amanda Noles?

18:49.193 --> 18:51.863
We were intimately
involved nine years ago.

18:51.895 --> 18:52.763
Lovers?

18:53.663 --> 18:58.336
I loved her, but sadly,
the feeling wasn't mutual.

18:59.270 --> 19:01.839
Reached out more times
than I care to mention,

19:01.873 --> 19:02.874
and I didn't hear from her again

19:02.907 --> 19:05.543
until the message that I
forward to your office.

19:05.576 --> 19:06.444
Oh.

19:11.682 --> 19:13.384
Hi
Felix, it's Amanda.

19:13.417 --> 19:14.852
I didn't know who else to call.

19:15.686 --> 19:18.589
I don't feel like myself,
I can't explain it.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.659
Things have been happening.

19:21.692 --> 19:24.195
Strange things.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.532
I wish I'd handled
things better between us.

19:30.999 --> 19:31.769
Why do you think
she called you?

19:33.304 --> 19:35.240
I have experience with events

19:35.272 --> 19:37.442
involving the
supernatural and beyond.

19:37.474 --> 19:40.311
Right, 'cause you
got the third eye.

19:40.345 --> 19:44.615
What do you think that she
meant by strange things?

19:45.950 --> 19:47.186
I can't be certain.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.520
Sheriff, can you tell me,

19:49.554 --> 19:51.790
did your investigators
find any oddities

19:51.823 --> 19:52.824
in the house that night?

19:52.856 --> 19:53.724
Nothing.

19:54.692 --> 19:55.559
Nothing.

19:55.593 --> 19:58.263
But a broken mirror.

19:58.296 --> 19:58.963
Where was it?

20:01.499 --> 20:03.434
Sheriff, please.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.836
What harm can come from
sharing that information?

20:08.772 --> 20:11.609
I'm still trying to figure
this all out, Professor.

20:12.443 --> 20:15.446
Will you tell me, was
it in Amanda's bedroom?

20:17.382 --> 20:18.483
The daughters.

20:18.516 --> 20:22.653
Dad!

20:25.289 --> 20:27.326
Are you ill, Professor?

21:01.893 --> 21:03.862
I left my
signing book in my car.

21:03.894 --> 21:05.963
Okay, did you need it today?

21:05.997 --> 21:08.667
Yeah, I'm helping the speech
pathologist after school.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.403
Okay, I'll
cancel my two o'clock...

21:12.436 --> 21:13.937
No, no, no, no,
Riley can take me

21:13.971 --> 21:15.339
on the way to the
center, it's fine.

21:15.373 --> 21:16.641
I'd rather you
not deal with that

21:16.673 --> 21:18.343
greaseball mechanic without me.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.743
My god dad.

21:19.777 --> 21:22.413
I saw the way her was
ogling you yesterday.

21:22.446 --> 21:23.647
I can handle myself, okay.

21:23.681 --> 21:25.717
I'm gonna be an adult
in like three weeks.

21:25.750 --> 21:26.785
Adult.

21:26.817 --> 21:28.420
At 18 you're hardly an adult.

21:28.452 --> 21:29.887
All right, your mom might let...

21:34.991 --> 21:36.927
I'll see you later, okay.

21:36.961 --> 21:37.828
I love you.

21:42.599 --> 21:44.501
Ogling means leering, right?

21:44.535 --> 21:45.804
What's leering mean?

21:57.414 --> 21:58.349
Ladies.

21:58.383 --> 22:00.117
Father Weller held
a Q and A on greeting

22:00.151 --> 22:01.586
at Friday's mass.

22:01.618 --> 22:03.355
I'd expect a chat.

22:03.387 --> 22:04.155
Right.

22:04.189 --> 22:05.023
Oh, and Miss
Froy's really sick.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.591
Yeah, and her
sub's an uber bitch.

22:06.624 --> 22:08.526
Yeah, like the sex
-starved nun type.

22:08.558 --> 22:09.427
Awesome.

22:18.035 --> 22:20.706
Sin is an infection
of the soul.

22:23.641 --> 22:26.912
Many people die from
infection every day.

22:28.779 --> 22:33.785
In serious cases, an
infected limb is amputated.

22:35.886 --> 22:39.490
When you sin you open
yourself up to evil.

22:40.258 --> 22:43.661
This evil will start to
infect your entire world

22:43.693 --> 22:45.864
and the world of
those around you.

22:48.532 --> 22:52.002
Is this offending your delicate
sensibilities Miss Meyer?

22:52.036 --> 22:53.738
It's making me wanna puke.

22:53.770 --> 22:57.008
We should be repulsed
by the wages of sin.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.476
Sin is ugly!

22:59.176 --> 23:01.145
It separates us from God

23:01.179 --> 23:03.749
and keeps us from
fulfilling our purpose!

23:04.749 --> 23:06.151
You must cut it out

23:06.183 --> 23:09.119
the moment it rears its head!

23:09.153 --> 23:12.624
Or else the devil
finds a foothold.

23:17.929 --> 23:18.797
Ugh.

23:20.464 --> 23:22.032
Go clean yourself
up Miss Noles.

23:25.036 --> 23:26.837
You have five minutes.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.092
Sarah.

23:50.928 --> 23:51.797
Sarah.

24:22.527 --> 24:23.194
Sarah.

25:03.634 --> 25:05.202
You may be disoriented Sarah.

25:06.002 --> 25:08.572
You're in the Saint
Joseph's infirmary.

25:08.605 --> 25:09.907
Do you think you can sit up?

25:10.974 --> 25:11.842
Yeah.

25:12.910 --> 25:13.879
Thank you sister.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.782
Now sadly, physical
manifestations like these

25:17.815 --> 25:19.784
can accompany the
grieving process.

25:21.051 --> 25:22.686
I'm fine Father Weller.

25:23.854 --> 25:25.123
Handling it in my own way

25:25.155 --> 25:27.259
as I'm sure you did
when your wife passed.

25:34.198 --> 25:35.166
I needed help.

25:37.268 --> 25:38.970
My daughter has yet to recover.

25:40.337 --> 25:42.173
That's why I'm so
concerned for you.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.943
I think I'm okay to
go back to class now.

26:14.137 --> 26:16.273
Your next patient's
stuck in pre-op,

26:16.307 --> 26:19.943
and there's a Felix
Fojas in the waiting area

26:19.977 --> 26:21.947
insisting that he
speak with you.

26:25.883 --> 26:26.750
Thank you.

26:29.220 --> 26:31.088
Do I need to have the
police remove you?

26:31.122 --> 26:32.957
I'm not the threat.

26:32.990 --> 26:33.824
What do you want?

26:33.857 --> 26:36.326
I wanna discuss
Amanda's message.

26:36.359 --> 26:38.128
You and Sarah are in danger.

26:38.162 --> 26:39.764
Don't mention my daughter,

26:39.797 --> 26:41.298
you hear me?

26:41.332 --> 26:42.200
Dr. Noles.

26:44.734 --> 26:46.770
You know about me, she told you.

26:46.804 --> 26:48.373
I came here because
I believe her.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.876
I came here to help.

26:52.910 --> 26:56.014
Six o'clock at the Broken
Barrel on Route Three.

26:56.047 --> 26:57.015
You'll have as
long as it takes me

26:57.048 --> 26:59.351
to finish a beer to say
what you need to say.

27:09.326 --> 27:12.430
Imari, thank you for
getting back to me so quick.

27:12.462 --> 27:14.031
How soon can you get to Ohio?

27:32.215 --> 27:33.717
He's not even here.

27:33.750 --> 27:35.653
Ugh, this place
is gross Sarah.

27:37.188 --> 27:39.124
You ladies should
learn how to knock.

27:41.392 --> 27:43.294
You might see something
you shouldn't of.

27:43.326 --> 27:45.962
We just need to
get something from her car.

27:49.165 --> 27:50.934
Personal effects
are over there.

28:01.746 --> 28:03.748
I'll play around with
the rear end later.

28:03.780 --> 28:07.918
Swap out them gears, have
her purring by morning.

28:09.353 --> 28:10.988
What was that?

28:11.020 --> 28:13.223
Nothing, are you jealous?

28:28.806 --> 28:31.275
Wonderful job Lucy!

28:31.307 --> 28:32.477
Let's give her a hand.

28:32.509 --> 28:34.878
Woo, good job!

28:34.912 --> 28:39.918
One word, we're here to improve
our sign language skills

28:40.084 --> 28:43.254
and help each other
sign one word,

28:43.287 --> 28:44.855
just like Lucy.

28:44.888 --> 28:48.024
It doesn't matter where
your comfort level lies.

28:48.057 --> 28:50.094
All right, now it's time
to break off into groups.

28:50.126 --> 28:52.896
All right, let's come over here.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.981
You won't even try?

29:17.855 --> 29:19.324
What are they doing in there?

29:26.430 --> 29:27.198
Who are what?

29:27.230 --> 29:29.232
I don't understand
what that means.

29:29.266 --> 29:30.567
Violent.

29:30.601 --> 29:33.104
You speak so well.

29:41.878 --> 29:44.115
No, it's her, it's her!

29:44.147 --> 29:46.082
- Hey!
- Don't touch me!

29:46.115 --> 29:48.952
- That's her! That's her!
- All right!

29:48.986 --> 29:49.954
Don't touch me!

29:49.987 --> 29:51.322
That's her!

29:51.355 --> 29:53.290
That's her! That's her!

30:20.116 --> 30:20.984
Hey J.

30:27.023 --> 30:28.158
Thank you for coming.

30:30.394 --> 30:31.261
Talk.

30:34.530 --> 30:35.465
Mandy mentioned that...

30:35.499 --> 30:37.902
Don't you say her
name like you knew her.

30:37.934 --> 30:39.403
Like you were close.

30:41.070 --> 30:42.105
It was a mistake.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.275
That's what she called it.

30:47.243 --> 30:48.879
She said strange
things were happening.

30:48.913 --> 30:50.914
Do you know what she
was talking about?

30:50.948 --> 30:53.218
I'm gonna tell you exactly
what I told Sheriff Garland.

30:54.585 --> 30:56.621
Mandy had just got
home from a work trip,

30:59.022 --> 30:59.890
she called my daughter,

30:59.923 --> 31:01.925
said there was an
intruder in the house.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.326
And the police didn't
find any physical

31:03.359 --> 31:05.096
evidence of an intruder?

31:05.128 --> 31:06.230
Signs of forced entry?

31:07.498 --> 31:08.499
What about your daughter?

31:08.532 --> 31:10.333
Is she acting differently
or out of character?

31:10.366 --> 31:11.635
I keep thinking
you're gonna have

31:11.669 --> 31:13.504
some sort of sense of propriety.

31:14.171 --> 31:16.173
I know that this is
upsetting, but it's-

31:16.205 --> 31:18.141
- You can't see it, can you!

31:19.242 --> 31:22.046
You come to my home
again, my work,

31:23.314 --> 31:25.917
or you go anywhere
near my daughter,

31:25.950 --> 31:28.152
and I'll kill you with
my bare fucking hands!

31:51.141 --> 31:52.009
Starting shit in here?

31:52.041 --> 31:53.477
That was not my intention.

31:55.311 --> 31:56.646
Not the fuck in here Frank!

31:56.680 --> 31:57.981
Shut the fuck up Jen!

32:15.566 --> 32:16.433
Hi dad.

32:17.768 --> 32:18.635
Hello.

32:27.443 --> 32:29.047
I believe I got your favorite.

32:30.513 --> 32:31.147
Wait, wait, wait!

32:31.182 --> 32:32.683
Are we forgetting something?

32:37.121 --> 32:38.723
Bless us oh Lord
and these thy gifts

32:38.756 --> 32:41.125
which we are about to receive.

33:03.180 --> 33:04.515
Amen!

33:04.548 --> 33:05.415
Let's eat.

33:26.603 --> 33:29.340
Who was that man this morning?

33:29.373 --> 33:30.240
Nobody.

33:31.508 --> 33:32.376
What'd he want?

33:40.250 --> 33:41.385
What do all men want?

33:42.286 --> 33:43.388
Things they can't have.

33:46.557 --> 33:47.658
Mom wanted what
she couldn't have

33:47.691 --> 33:48.726
and she still had it.

33:52.395 --> 33:54.330
What's that supposed to mean?

33:54.364 --> 33:57.268
You talk cryptic,
I'll talk cryptic.

34:01.704 --> 34:04.607
What's wrong with you Sarah?

34:04.641 --> 34:07.478
What's wrong with you Thane?

34:07.510 --> 34:09.246
You're the one that can't
admit that she was a whore.

34:09.277 --> 34:10.481
Hey, watch your tongue!

34:11.614 --> 34:13.382
You're so fucking weak.

34:13.416 --> 34:14.751
Hey!

34:15.652 --> 34:16.454
Hey!

34:16.487 --> 34:18.188
Have you lost your mind!

34:18.222 --> 34:19.657
Hey!

34:19.690 --> 34:20.523
Hey!

34:20.556 --> 34:21.625
Get down here!

34:26.230 --> 34:28.297
Sarah, open up this
door right now!

34:30.134 --> 34:33.369
Open it up or I will open
it for you young lady!

34:33.402 --> 34:34.704
Sarah!

35:23.353 --> 35:25.690
Isn't it past your bedtime?

35:29.393 --> 35:32.730
Don't you start nothing
you can't finish.

35:33.931 --> 35:35.133
Oh, careful!

35:35.898 --> 35:37.734
My wife's upstairs.

36:37.594 --> 36:39.230
Sheriff.

36:39.262 --> 36:40.630
Get up, come on.

36:45.601 --> 36:46.869
There you go.

36:46.902 --> 36:48.538
Who did this to ya?

36:48.572 --> 36:49.472
Does it matter?

36:50.673 --> 36:51.342
Hell yeah it matters,

36:51.375 --> 36:53.643
now I gotta lock their asses up.

36:53.677 --> 36:55.746
Am I under arrest?

36:55.778 --> 36:56.813
Let's just say,

37:00.284 --> 37:02.586
you're my guest until I
get you to urgent care.

37:09.693 --> 37:10.661
Go for ride one.

37:12.663 --> 37:15.398
They need you over
at that Moffett's place Roy.

37:16.166 --> 37:18.236
Clyde's there and
says it's real bad.

37:22.539 --> 37:23.407
I'm en route.

37:42.858 --> 37:44.461
Remain in the vehicle.

37:47.463 --> 37:48.666
Oh my God!

37:48.699 --> 37:50.367
- Oh my fucking God!
- Ma'am!

37:50.400 --> 37:51.635
- What happened!
- Ma'am!

37:51.668 --> 37:53.436
Who did this!

37:53.469 --> 37:54.538
What are
you gonna do about it?

37:54.570 --> 37:55.972
What is happening!

37:56.907 --> 37:57.675
Fucking find out!

37:57.708 --> 37:58.375
Ma'am,
off the premises!

37:58.409 --> 38:00.378
Mullins, get her out of here!

38:11.954 --> 38:13.023
We need every deputy up now.

38:13.056 --> 38:15.025
I need every deputy
awake, out here,

38:15.057 --> 38:16.592
we need to shut
down the perimeter.

38:16.626 --> 38:17.494
We've gotta make sure that...

38:17.527 --> 38:19.530
Hey, I told you to
stay in the vehicle!

38:21.565 --> 38:22.833
But this is witchcraft.

38:23.632 --> 38:25.535
Call Mount Vernon PD,
get forensics out here.

38:25.568 --> 38:27.036
You get back in the car.

38:27.070 --> 38:29.373
You get back in the car now!

38:29.405 --> 38:31.708
Before I charge you with
disobeying a police order!

39:03.940 --> 39:04.907
Oh my God.

39:04.940 --> 39:05.809
Oh my God.

39:07.744 --> 39:09.380
Sarah!

39:09.413 --> 39:10.081
Baby!

39:13.416 --> 39:14.050
Hey!

39:14.083 --> 39:15.152
Stop!

39:15.184 --> 39:17.887
Sarah! Sarah!

39:17.920 --> 39:19.389
I am talking to you!

39:19.422 --> 39:20.090
Hey!

39:25.594 --> 39:26.863
- Sarah!
- What?

39:26.896 --> 39:28.532
Where the
hell have you been?

39:28.565 --> 39:29.500
What are you talking about?

39:29.532 --> 39:30.567
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

39:30.599 --> 39:31.835
Look at you!

39:31.867 --> 39:32.735
Look at you!

39:32.768 --> 39:34.504
You're soaking wet
and covered in mud!

39:36.505 --> 39:37.774
Where the hell have you been?

39:37.807 --> 39:39.076
I was
having a nightmare.

39:39.108 --> 39:40.777
You weren't sleeping
darling, okay.

39:40.811 --> 39:43.847
I just saw you walk into
this house half naked!

39:43.880 --> 39:46.717
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:46.750 --> 39:48.518
- Where the hell were you!
- Hey, hey, hey!

39:48.552 --> 39:50.721
I was sleeping!

39:52.789 --> 39:54.125
Don't you leave this room!

40:04.134 --> 40:06.969
Sorry Sheriff, Sarah's fine.

40:07.003 --> 40:08.572
I apologize for
wasting your time.

40:08.605 --> 40:10.039
Nita said that
you were panicked,

40:10.072 --> 40:11.607
you were driving all around
town looking for her.

40:11.641 --> 40:15.012
Yeah, I was, but
it was my mistake.

40:15.045 --> 40:17.481
I should've called
letting you people know.

40:18.514 --> 40:20.183
I've just been
having a hard time.

40:20.217 --> 40:21.519
I understand.

40:22.952 --> 40:24.088
Who's in the car?

40:26.755 --> 40:27.924
Well some fruit
loop from California

40:27.958 --> 40:29.793
got himself assaulted
at the Barrel.

40:32.094 --> 40:34.197
Has he received
medical attention?

40:34.231 --> 40:35.632
Taking him there now.

40:35.664 --> 40:37.802
Bring him inside,
I'll take a look.

40:46.510 --> 40:49.580
You seem to have the same
effect on everyone, huh?

40:50.679 --> 40:52.181
Must be my personality.

40:52.215 --> 40:53.083
Yeah, well,

40:54.016 --> 40:55.018
nothing's broken.

40:58.088 --> 40:59.457
You all right Sheriff?

41:00.590 --> 41:02.659
Yeah, I gotta get back
over to Ed Moffett's place.

41:02.692 --> 41:03.693
Ed Moffett?

41:03.726 --> 41:04.795
He fixes our cars.

41:05.961 --> 41:06.831
Not anymore.

41:08.664 --> 41:10.867
We got a deputy coming to
pick you up any minute.

41:12.969 --> 41:13.871
Are we okay here?

41:16.206 --> 41:17.039
Yeah.

41:17.072 --> 41:17.942
Okay.

41:21.811 --> 41:24.648
Hey, I want you to think on
the men that assaulted you.

41:24.681 --> 41:25.949
Give me some descriptions.

41:27.617 --> 41:29.653
You ain't gonna be
sleeping well tonight.

41:30.653 --> 41:31.722
They shouldn't either!

41:35.858 --> 41:38.996
I had no idea those idiots
would do that to your face.

41:40.563 --> 41:41.598
Yet here we are.

41:45.068 --> 41:46.504
Where are we exactly?

41:48.704 --> 41:51.942
Someone is attacking your
family using witchcraft.

41:53.742 --> 41:56.246
And I came here to do
something about that.

41:56.278 --> 41:58.715
You have any evidence
supporting that claim?

42:00.583 --> 42:02.652
Nothing that a man of
science would accept.

42:03.387 --> 42:04.321
But Amanda knew
something was happening-

42:04.353 --> 42:05.121
- I heard the message.

42:05.155 --> 42:06.323
Well then, you
know that I'm the

42:06.356 --> 42:08.692
last person she wanted to call.

42:08.724 --> 42:09.592
I can admit that.

42:09.626 --> 42:10.294
Okay, you seem-

42:10.327 --> 42:12.129
- There was fear in her voice!

42:13.362 --> 42:15.231
You seem to be
under the assumption

42:16.865 --> 42:18.701
that I believe in witchcraft.

42:18.735 --> 42:20.304
But you can't tell me what,

42:20.336 --> 42:22.239
if anything is happening here!

42:24.907 --> 42:29.179
You can't tell me what
Mandy was concerned about!

42:29.211 --> 42:30.713
So tell me Felix,

42:32.681 --> 42:33.884
where does that leave us?

42:38.088 --> 42:38.956
Your ride's here.

43:24.034 --> 43:27.104
It's better this way, Sarah.

44:16.186 --> 44:17.054
Yeah!

44:21.123 --> 44:23.926
This is the day that
the Lord has made!

44:23.960 --> 44:25.329
Rejoice and be glad.

44:27.864 --> 44:29.699
And get dressed.

44:29.733 --> 44:33.003
I hope you brought coffee.

44:55.224 --> 44:56.793
Well good morning!

44:56.826 --> 44:58.262
Hurry along, don't be late now!

44:59.295 --> 45:00.164
Father Weller.

45:00.864 --> 45:04.333
Poor animal was suffering
from separation anxiety.

45:04.367 --> 45:06.403
He simply adored my wife.

45:06.436 --> 45:07.771
I only bring him on campus now

45:07.804 --> 45:09.271
when my daughter's
at the clinic.

45:09.304 --> 45:10.173
Sit.

45:11.373 --> 45:13.242
I'm a little
concerned with Sarah.

45:13.275 --> 45:14.944
How can I help?

45:14.978 --> 45:18.514
She been acting
different in school?

45:18.547 --> 45:20.316
No, nothing that I've
been made aware of,

45:20.349 --> 45:21.951
but I can certainly
look into it for you.

45:21.985 --> 45:23.086
I'd appreciate that.

45:23.119 --> 45:23.987
Of course.

45:24.853 --> 45:25.922
Good morning.

45:27.289 --> 45:28.157
Doctor,

45:29.391 --> 45:31.494
have you spoken to
anyone about your grief?

45:33.228 --> 45:34.497
How can we possibly
help our children

45:34.530 --> 45:35.998
if we can't help ourselves?

45:37.567 --> 45:39.737
I understand what
you're going through.

45:41.003 --> 45:41.938
Believe me.

45:42.871 --> 45:44.007
Run? Let's run!

45:44.039 --> 45:45.208
Here we go Sampson!

46:00.023 --> 46:01.925
This property has been cursed.

46:01.958 --> 46:03.326
Initially I thought
it was a haunting,

46:03.358 --> 46:04.961
but I've been inside the home.

46:06.329 --> 46:08.465
There must be something
to find on the grounds.

46:12.101 --> 46:13.903
You said the family's
not involved.

46:15.605 --> 46:17.407
Can we ever be
certain of anything?

46:17.440 --> 46:18.809
Yes.

46:18.842 --> 46:20.210
Of a great many things.

46:25.081 --> 46:25.949
For one,

46:26.983 --> 46:28.085
the family's not home.

46:29.418 --> 46:31.121
We'll return when
they're present.

46:36.259 --> 46:37.126
Felix.

46:39.195 --> 46:40.063
Felix!

46:42.465 --> 46:44.835
You knew they would
be away, didn't you?

46:44.867 --> 46:46.503
I expected it,
but I didn't know.

46:46.536 --> 46:49.606
See, that is exactly why
your vows were doomed Felix.

46:49.639 --> 46:51.307
You know why my vows
were doomed Imari.

46:51.340 --> 46:52.976
I know we're trespassing

46:53.009 --> 46:55.110
because you blur the
lines between right

46:55.143 --> 46:57.012
and wrong when it
suits your whim.

46:57.045 --> 46:58.547
I am doing what is right.

46:58.581 --> 46:59.849
By breaking the law,

47:00.550 --> 47:02.385
you cannot choose
what rules to follow

47:02.418 --> 47:04.019
when you follow God, Felix.

47:04.052 --> 47:05.422
God will not let me be tempted

47:05.454 --> 47:07.023
beyond what I can bare.

47:07.056 --> 47:08.490
But when I am tempted
he will provide

47:08.523 --> 47:10.193
for me a pathway to salvation?

47:11.994 --> 47:13.929
Where is my path Imari?

47:13.963 --> 47:16.333
I'm not gonna have the same
conversation with you again,

47:16.365 --> 47:18.268
and again, and again, and again!

47:18.300 --> 47:19.536
And I will not trespass!

47:21.271 --> 47:23.073
That's noble of you Imari.

47:23.106 --> 47:24.908
But absolutely no
value to this girl

47:24.940 --> 47:26.275
under attack by
spiritual forces!

47:26.309 --> 47:28.411
This is not about the girl!

47:28.443 --> 47:31.380
This is about you always knowing
what's best for everyone!

47:33.181 --> 47:34.917
Now God knows
what's best for me,

47:35.617 --> 47:38.487
and requires my
absolute obedience.

47:40.056 --> 47:41.258
And that I give with joy.

47:44.661 --> 47:45.863
Her name is Sarah.

47:50.465 --> 47:52.368
And you can wait in the car.

48:32.275 --> 48:34.177
Did you
think I loved you?

48:40.315 --> 48:41.384
I needed you.

48:47.724 --> 48:49.626
You should've answered my call.

48:58.501 --> 49:00.003
You should've been there.

49:07.043 --> 49:08.178
Sarah's in danger.

49:14.150 --> 49:15.552
She's after Sarah.

49:31.333 --> 49:32.601
Help me! Help!

49:32.635 --> 49:33.503
Help me!

49:35.038 --> 49:36.338
Help!

49:36.371 --> 49:37.239
Help!

49:50.253 --> 49:51.121
Help!

49:54.523 --> 49:56.393
- No, no!
- Felix! Felix!

49:56.425 --> 49:59.362
- No, no, no!
- Felix! Felix!

49:59.394 --> 50:00.262
You're okay.

50:00.295 --> 50:01.230
Look, look.

50:09.137 --> 50:10.239
Call the Sheriff.

50:12.074 --> 50:12.742
Now.

50:15.677 --> 50:17.279
I can't be certain we're in the

50:17.313 --> 50:19.016
same section of the woods.

50:21.284 --> 50:22.385
Tell Gage to finish up

50:22.418 --> 50:23.519
and meet us back at the station!

50:23.552 --> 50:26.355
No Sheriff, it's
here, I'm not lying.

50:26.389 --> 50:27.257
These woods are

50:28.657 --> 50:29.525
vast.

50:33.528 --> 50:34.398
Hey.

50:35.065 --> 50:36.231
I'm gonna do the
best thing that I can

50:36.264 --> 50:37.165
do for you right now sir,

50:37.199 --> 50:39.168
I'm gonna drive you
back to your hotel,

50:39.202 --> 50:41.137
I'm gonna help you
personally pack your things.

50:41.170 --> 50:42.305
Sheriff...

50:42.338 --> 50:44.807
If I don't, you're gonna
have a real problem with me.

50:55.184 --> 50:56.053
Sheriff!

51:04.327 --> 51:05.795
This one's different.

51:05.827 --> 51:06.661
How?

51:06.695 --> 51:08.697
Don't touch it,
it's weather aged.

51:08.731 --> 51:10.700
Whoever did this tried it once

51:10.733 --> 51:12.268
and didn't see the
desired results

51:12.300 --> 51:13.134
so they tried it again

51:13.168 --> 51:14.536
and we caught them
in the act today.

51:14.570 --> 51:16.739
Someone has cast a
spell on this girl.

51:16.771 --> 51:19.476
All right, all right,
let's just slow down.

51:19.509 --> 51:20.610
You guys can explain to me-

51:20.643 --> 51:21.510
- Sheriff!

51:23.278 --> 51:24.414
Gage found a phone.

51:25.748 --> 51:28.184
In the creek bed,
by the clothes line.

51:33.456 --> 51:35.892
Have Nita give me
the name and address

51:35.925 --> 51:37.727
on every number
in that call log.

51:38.827 --> 51:39.496
Make sure the Father gets back

51:39.528 --> 51:41.697
to wherever he's going safely.

51:41.731 --> 51:42.599
You're with me.

51:43.900 --> 51:45.602
I'll call you.

51:53.576 --> 51:55.311
I went to high school
with Jillian Bartell.

51:55.344 --> 51:56.112
She's a good Christian,

51:56.144 --> 51:57.579
should be able to
track the phone

51:57.612 --> 51:59.481
to a name and address.

51:59.514 --> 52:01.518
Unless you start on
about your third eye

52:01.550 --> 52:02.518
and piss her off.

52:02.552 --> 52:04.287
Sheriff,
the coroner would like

52:04.320 --> 52:07.356
to talk to you about
Moffett's death.

52:07.389 --> 52:09.625
Yeah, Mullins handling
it for me, will ya?

52:09.659 --> 52:11.595
Copy that.

52:14.931 --> 52:17.567
Where's your mask, Caleb?

52:18.833 --> 52:20.435
Sir, sir, are you okay?

52:20.469 --> 52:21.170
Do not move!

52:21.202 --> 52:23.806
Code 6C, Sheriff
requires backup!

52:25.675 --> 52:27.310
Are you okay?

52:27.342 --> 52:28.344
Calm down now Caleb!

52:28.376 --> 52:30.579
Nothing we can't still workout!

53:55.030 --> 53:56.233
God damn it.

53:59.367 --> 54:02.404
There's something
I need you to hear.

54:05.675 --> 54:06.909
Knox County 9-1-1,

54:06.942 --> 54:09.012
what's your emergency?

54:09.045 --> 54:09.746
Are you there?

54:13.682 --> 54:14.818
Rewind that.

54:17.385 --> 54:18.755
Knox County 9-1-1,

54:18.788 --> 54:20.722
what's your emergency?

54:20.755 --> 54:21.690
Are you there?

54:26.362 --> 54:27.497
Now I'm no audiologist,

54:27.530 --> 54:29.899
but that doesn't sound
like our janitor.

54:29.931 --> 54:30.866
- No.
- Or,

54:31.701 --> 54:33.503
Any human being
I've ever heard in my life,

54:33.536 --> 54:35.505
let alone Amanda Noles.

54:35.538 --> 54:36.405
Agreed.

54:40.543 --> 54:42.644
We can agree though
that there's no

54:42.677 --> 54:44.280
boogeyman out there.

54:45.148 --> 54:47.416
We're dealing with
flesh and blood here.

54:47.449 --> 54:48.284
For now.

54:52.387 --> 54:53.789
You're a confounding
individual Professor,

54:53.822 --> 54:55.791
that's not the answer
I was looking for.

54:56.559 --> 55:00.764
Sheriff, they need you!

55:30.726 --> 55:32.929
We got his address.

55:51.914 --> 55:52.849
Sheriff.

55:53.615 --> 55:56.385
Ma'am, could
we talk inside?

55:56.418 --> 55:58.087
We can talk here on the porch.

56:01.423 --> 56:03.927
There's been an
incident, with Caleb.

56:06.929 --> 56:08.131
Yeah, I'm sorry ma'am.

56:12.802 --> 56:16.840
You'd like to think that
they're wrong about your kids.

56:19.074 --> 56:21.411
But you know what you see.

56:22.577 --> 56:24.579
I'd like to take
a look in his room.

56:24.612 --> 56:27.115
But he ain't been
in there for months.

56:27.148 --> 56:29.418
Spends most of his
time in the tree house

56:29.452 --> 56:31.054
that him and his daddy built.

56:31.788 --> 56:33.856
Over there at the
end of the property.

56:49.771 --> 56:50.639
Christina!

56:52.541 --> 56:53.510
Sampson?

57:37.619 --> 57:40.022
Christina, what have you done?

58:03.913 --> 58:07.050
Bring
me the innocent one.

58:08.016 --> 58:09.219
Let their blood

58:10.318 --> 58:11.653
feed my roots.

58:14.322 --> 58:15.190
And I

58:16.759 --> 58:18.027
will reward you.

58:28.971 --> 58:29.838
Sampson.

58:55.230 --> 58:56.099
Christina!

58:58.367 --> 58:59.235
Sampson!

59:03.606 --> 59:04.274
Christina!

59:35.838 --> 59:36.839
Christina!

01:00:08.403 --> 01:00:10.039
No, no, no, no!

01:00:10.072 --> 01:00:11.074
No, Sampson!

01:00:52.047 --> 01:00:53.182
Look at you!

01:01:23.177 --> 01:01:26.415
Hey sweetie, you
look beautiful.

01:01:28.817 --> 01:01:31.019
I want you to meet
someone, follow me.

01:01:47.068 --> 01:01:47.936
Hey!

01:01:51.072 --> 01:01:52.074
Hey! Sarah!

01:01:56.177 --> 01:01:57.045
Sarah!

01:02:01.182 --> 01:02:02.050
Hey!

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.402
You can go back anytime.

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.438
Who'd protect you then?

01:02:25.907 --> 01:02:27.242
You're not gonna
get any out here.

01:02:30.445 --> 01:02:32.181
Radio works though.

01:02:32.213 --> 01:02:33.516
Up to 30 miles.

01:02:33.548 --> 01:02:34.416
Good.

01:02:55.436 --> 01:02:56.304
Sarah!

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:09.951
Sarah!

01:03:11.452 --> 01:03:12.320
Sarah!

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:17.326
Oh my God!

01:03:17.358 --> 01:03:18.360
No baby, no!

01:03:21.262 --> 01:03:22.898
No Sarah!

01:03:22.931 --> 01:03:23.800
Baby.

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:27.403
My God, Sarah, Sarah!

01:03:28.402 --> 01:03:30.138
Baby, baby, come on.

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:10.313
How the hell does
he get in here?

01:04:22.657 --> 01:04:24.058
All right, help me here.

01:04:24.092 --> 01:04:25.094
Maybe I should go.

01:04:27.496 --> 01:04:29.298
No, you stay here.

01:04:39.373 --> 01:04:40.242
Anything?

01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:43.578
I got a beetle.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.485
It's tied to a nail in
the floor with human hair.

01:04:50.518 --> 01:04:52.086
That's a binding spell.

01:04:52.119 --> 01:04:54.123
They were probably
using it on Caleb.

01:04:54.155 --> 01:04:55.023
Don't touch it.

01:05:40.335 --> 01:05:41.537
Identify yourself!

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:42.438
Sheriff!

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:46.474
Identify yourself,
slowly remove your hood

01:05:46.507 --> 01:05:48.443
or I will do it for you.

01:05:48.476 --> 01:05:49.344
Sheriff!

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.548
We need to go, now!

01:06:28.449 --> 01:06:29.317
Sheriff!

01:06:33.621 --> 01:06:35.456
Sheriff! Sheriff!

01:06:35.489 --> 01:06:36.358
Shit!

01:06:41.128 --> 01:06:42.030
What happened to me?

01:06:42.063 --> 01:06:43.031
You've been cursed.

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:45.400
Come on, we need to get
you back to the stream.

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:46.302
We need to get living water

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:49.038
into your system or
you're gonna die!

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:51.606
Come on!

01:07:01.182 --> 01:07:03.251
It can't be much further.

01:07:10.224 --> 01:07:11.259
You can't carry me.

01:07:16.264 --> 01:07:17.133
Go!

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:22.204
I'll be right back.

01:07:22.237 --> 01:07:23.338
Go.

01:07:23.371 --> 01:07:24.240
Go.

01:07:26.407 --> 01:07:27.742
Oh shit, oh shit.

01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:42.690
10-3 officer down.

01:07:42.724 --> 01:07:44.427
10-3 officer down.

01:10:34.895 --> 01:10:38.332
Sheriff,
do you copy?

01:10:38.365 --> 01:10:40.301
You're a day late and
a dollar short Mullins.

01:10:40.335 --> 01:10:41.636
I'm in the back of
the Crowley property,

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:45.539
we're about half mile
from State Route 73.

01:11:04.993 --> 01:11:05.861
Oh shit.

01:11:20.408 --> 01:11:21.277
Oh shit.

01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:25.913
You're gonna be okay,
just keep pressure on it.

01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:35.556
Why do all of this?

01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:37.793
To hear again, like you.

01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:40.029
Like with my mother.

01:11:44.765 --> 01:11:45.634
But why

01:11:47.502 --> 01:11:48.370
Sarah?

01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:51.605
Why hurt her mother?

01:11:51.639 --> 01:11:53.676
Why would she think
we hurt her mother?

01:14:11.145 --> 01:14:12.581
Dad?

01:14:12.613 --> 01:14:13.647
Dad!

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.849
Daddy!

01:14:14.882 --> 01:14:19.854
Help daddy!

01:14:20.988 --> 01:14:21.923
Help daddy!

01:15:01.261 --> 01:15:03.532
Your father will
be fine ladies.

01:15:05.166 --> 01:15:07.569
God is watching over him now.

01:15:07.601 --> 01:15:08.936
Thank you Father.

01:15:11.939 --> 01:15:12.807
Excuse me.

01:15:29.923 --> 01:15:32.728
I loathe that
expression on your face.

01:15:34.328 --> 01:15:36.664
If I'd just
answered that call-

01:15:37.798 --> 01:15:39.768
- Do not wrestle
with the past, Felix.

01:15:43.037 --> 01:15:44.039
It will win.

01:15:44.905 --> 01:15:50.112
It already has.

01:15:53.046 --> 01:15:54.315
Thank you Imari.

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:56.752
For everything.

01:16:10.898 --> 01:16:14.136
The autopsy report is on
the Sheriff's nightstand.

01:16:16.404 --> 01:16:19.007
We'll be needing fresh waters.

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:06.221
Jesus!

01:17:06.253 --> 01:17:07.087
- Christ!
- I didn't mean to

01:17:07.121 --> 01:17:07.989
Startle you.

01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:10.891
I read Amanda's autopsy report.

01:17:12.926 --> 01:17:15.229
If someone had let me know
she was found in the woods

01:17:15.262 --> 01:17:16.664
and stopped breathing,
I would've known

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:18.266
what we were dealing
with from the beginning.

01:17:18.298 --> 01:17:20.268
This syndrome is
demonic in nature.

01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:21.269
- It wasn't the witches,
- I don't...

01:17:21.301 --> 01:17:22.871
They were just
a toy for this demon.

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:24.406
I don't understand.

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:27.175
Amanda's company was drilling
wells in the Philippines

01:17:27.207 --> 01:17:29.009
and clearing trees.

01:17:29.042 --> 01:17:30.679
When these trees are cut down

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:32.681
vengeful spirits
can be released.

01:17:32.713 --> 01:17:33.381
Batibat.

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:37.953
Once it's released it
enters a human host,

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.822
and finds a new wooden home.

01:17:42.055 --> 01:17:43.692
And I believe that that demon

01:17:45.292 --> 01:17:48.896
followed Amanda back
from the Philippines.

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.331
Sheriff, if we
don't act quickly,

01:17:50.363 --> 01:17:51.832
her body could
become the permanent

01:17:51.865 --> 01:17:54.269
home for this
vengeful, angry spirit.

01:18:02.076 --> 01:18:04.378
It's time to take the
pigs out of your parlor.

01:18:13.287 --> 01:18:18.293
It knows we're here.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.869
Imagine how you would feel if
someone came into your home

01:18:30.805 --> 01:18:33.173
and tried to rip you out of it.

01:18:33.207 --> 01:18:38.113
That is what we're going
to do with this Batibat.

01:18:38.145 --> 01:18:40.380
And it shall leave
as instructed!

01:18:44.318 --> 01:18:47.222
Father Imari Josiah Olawale.

01:18:49.055 --> 01:18:50.023
Thane Noles.

01:18:50.056 --> 01:18:53.327
Are you prepared to
give yourself to God,

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.997
the Almighty
tonight, Thane Noles?

01:19:01.802 --> 01:19:02.871
We need fresh water.

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:03.972
Not from the property.

01:19:35.569 --> 01:19:38.172
She said that she loved you.

01:19:40.274 --> 01:19:41.409
And that you loved her.

01:19:49.917 --> 01:19:54.389
I did.

01:20:09.002 --> 01:20:10.171
We start at dawn.

01:20:12.439 --> 01:20:13.307
Imari,

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:17.345
it's unwise to proceed
without a woman present.

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:21.382
We need a woman of God.

01:20:21.414 --> 01:20:23.917
Someone God loving, God fearing.

01:20:23.951 --> 01:20:26.988
Someone who cares for him.

01:20:34.295 --> 01:20:36.530
And we're going to
need a vessel for this spirit.

01:20:37.965 --> 01:20:38.934
Something isolated.

01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:42.270
Where it will
remain undisturbed.

01:21:17.637 --> 01:21:18.873
It is time.

01:21:25.246 --> 01:21:27.916
Do not be alarmed when
you see your daughter.

01:21:29.516 --> 01:21:32.921
She may or may not
resemble her former self.

01:21:32.953 --> 01:21:34.288
But rest assured,

01:21:36.023 --> 01:21:37.192
she is present.

01:21:54.675 --> 01:21:55.677
Christ hears

01:21:57.444 --> 01:21:59.646
God the Father in heaven.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.483
God the Son, redeemer of man,

01:22:02.716 --> 01:22:03.918
have mercy on us.

01:22:05.252 --> 01:22:06.922
Oh my God, Sarah.

01:22:12.092 --> 01:22:13.627
Deliver us from your wrath.

01:22:14.328 --> 01:22:17.598
From sudden and
unprovided death.

01:22:17.631 --> 01:22:20.001
From the snares of the devil.

01:22:24.637 --> 01:22:25.472
What is she saying?

01:22:25.506 --> 01:22:26.341
Lies.

01:22:26.373 --> 01:22:27.407
Stand firm.

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:36.617
Get him out of here!

01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:37.585
Remove him!

01:22:45.091 --> 01:22:47.494
I'm fine, I'm fine,
help my daughter!

01:22:47.528 --> 01:22:49.597
If it gets worse, leave!

01:22:49.630 --> 01:22:51.065
Fill your servant with courage

01:22:51.097 --> 01:22:54.301
to fight against that
reprobate dragon!

01:22:54.335 --> 01:22:56.003
Let your mighty hand cast this

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:57.739
demon out of your servant Sarah,

01:22:57.771 --> 01:23:00.173
so it may no longer
hold captive this person

01:23:00.207 --> 01:23:02.643
whom pleased you to
make in your own image

01:23:02.676 --> 01:23:04.679
and to redeem
through Christ Jesus

01:23:04.712 --> 01:23:06.748
who lives and reigns
with you forever!

01:23:12.752 --> 01:23:14.021
It wants a new host.

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:17.725
The Lord is
willing to negotiate.

01:23:17.757 --> 01:23:19.527
I am not!

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:24.432
You'll occupy no
more of God's children!

01:23:33.006 --> 01:23:35.208
- Get her off the property!
- You can't be in here alone.

01:23:35.242 --> 01:23:36.378
Now!

01:23:40.581 --> 01:23:43.251
Get her off the property
or her sight will be lost!

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:47.622
Imari!

01:23:47.654 --> 01:23:49.590
Imari!

01:23:49.622 --> 01:23:52.225
I command you, unclean spirit,

01:23:52.259 --> 01:23:54.228
by the resurrection
and ascension of our

01:23:54.261 --> 01:23:55.663
Lord Jesus Christ.

01:23:55.695 --> 01:23:57.631
By the descent of
the Holy Spirit

01:23:57.664 --> 01:23:59.567
and the coming of
the Lord for judgment

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.769
and a day and hour
of your departure!

01:24:01.801 --> 01:24:04.572
I command you moreover
to obey me by the letter!

01:24:04.604 --> 01:24:08.308
I am a minister of God!

01:24:14.681 --> 01:24:16.518
Don't
let her take Sarah.

01:24:29.329 --> 01:24:30.430
Imari.

01:24:30.463 --> 01:24:33.068
The stain was on the mother.

01:24:34.301 --> 01:24:35.370
And your lust

01:24:37.171 --> 01:24:39.807
of this flesh betrays you.

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.708
Do not think of
despising my command

01:24:41.742 --> 01:24:44.445
because you know me
to be a great sinner.

01:24:44.478 --> 01:24:46.681
For it is God himself
who commands you.

01:24:48.181 --> 01:24:49.850
You shall not be
emboldened to inhabit

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:51.385
this creature of God any longer,

01:24:51.417 --> 01:24:54.721
and I cast you out in the
name of Lord Jesus Christ!

01:24:54.755 --> 01:24:56.490
You can have me now.

01:24:58.859 --> 01:24:59.794
I am yours.

01:25:01.395 --> 01:25:03.364
If you allow me to stay.

01:25:11.604 --> 01:25:13.206
Make no resistance

01:25:13.239 --> 01:25:15.309
nor delay in
quitting this woman.

01:25:15.341 --> 01:25:18.212
For it has pleased Christ
to dwell in Sarah Noles.

01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:21.382
And you are no longer welcomed.

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:24.152
I command you to return
to the designated vessel

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:27.488
I have prepared, for it
is he who cleans you.

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.190
He who flung you headlong
from the heights of heaven.

01:25:30.224 --> 01:25:31.826
He who once stilled the sea,

01:25:31.859 --> 01:25:33.761
and the wind and the storm.

01:25:33.793 --> 01:25:36.497
Harken therefore,
and tremble in fear.

01:25:36.529 --> 01:25:40.768
And may the trembling that
affects this human prey.

01:25:40.801 --> 01:25:43.604
The fear that afflicts
this image of God,

01:25:43.636 --> 01:25:45.506
descend on you
foul creature now!

01:26:12.365 --> 01:26:15.435
I got you, I got you, I got you.

01:26:15.469 --> 01:26:17.438
You're okay, you're okay.

01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:18.738
I got you.

01:26:18.771 --> 01:26:20.440
- Sarah!
- Dad!

01:26:20.474 --> 01:26:21.708
You're okay baby.

01:26:21.742 --> 01:26:22.577
Oh, and you?

01:26:22.609 --> 01:26:24.478
You're okay.

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:31.619
So the
family is safe?

01:26:31.652 --> 01:26:33.287
They are.

01:26:33.319 --> 01:26:34.889
And you?

01:26:34.921 --> 01:26:35.889
Awakened.

01:26:36.823 --> 01:26:37.858
A calling?

01:26:38.891 --> 01:26:40.327
A warning.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.261
To stay vigilant.

01:26:42.662 --> 01:26:44.298
The darkness is getting closer.

01:26:45.298 --> 01:26:46.201
I can see it.

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:50.438
Which
is why he chose you

01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:53.507
to help others find the light.
