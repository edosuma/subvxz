00:42.125 --> 00:43.375
WATCHER: <i>Time.</i>

00:46.583 --> 00:47.958
<i>Space.</i>

00:49.375 --> 00:50.750
<i>Reality.</i>

00:53.250 --> 00:55.333
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

00:59.666 --> 01:04.458
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility.</i>

01:06.916 --> 01:10.666
<i>Where a single choice</i>
<i>can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

01:13.041 --> 01:16.166
<i>creating alternate worlds</i>
<i>from the ones you know.</i>

01:19.833 --> 01:21.375
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

01:23.541 --> 01:26.750
<i>I am your guide</i>
<i>through these vast new realities.</i>

01:28.208 --> 01:32.000
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

01:35.416 --> 01:36.875
<i>"What if?"</i>

01:42.041 --> 01:45.208
<i>We have watched</i>
<i>how one moment, one choice,</i>

01:45.291 --> 01:47.083
<i>can ripple across space and time,</i>

01:47.166 --> 01:51.666
<i>giving birth to new stories,</i>
<i>heroes, whole universes.</i>

01:51.750 --> 01:53.791
<i>But what if it's the wrong choice?</i>

01:53.875 --> 01:58.791
<i>What if the best of intentions</i>
<i>has very strange consequences?</i>

02:06.958 --> 02:08.458
Evening, handsome.

02:08.541 --> 02:11.125
This? I just pulled it out of the dryer.

02:11.208 --> 02:13.500
Whereas you, stunning.

02:13.583 --> 02:17.666
I'm only going for dessert.
You promised me crème brûlée.

02:18.416 --> 02:21.125
(CHUCKLES) I suspect we can do
a little better than that.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.333
Hmm...

02:25.166 --> 02:26.750
CHRISTINE: Just let me hear it.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.916
Come on, I know you prepared something.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.291
You wouldn't just wing it. It's just me.

02:31.375 --> 02:35.541
Okay. Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) "Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen, fellow doctors--"

02:35.625 --> 02:38.416
(GROANS) No. No. Stop. I'm already asleep.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.750
Come on, cut the preamble.
Just get straight to the heart of it.

02:41.833 --> 02:43.416
But all I said was, "Good evening."

02:43.500 --> 02:47.125
I think you should just rush the podium
like a contestant on <i>The Price is Right.</i>

02:47.208 --> 02:51.041
Screaming and high-fiving,
and cheering, and something crazy.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.416
<i>Price is </i>what?

02:53.416 --> 02:55.833
-We need to celebrate this.
-We are.

02:55.916 --> 02:59.666
You performed a radical hemispherectomy.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.875
-Successfully.
-Well, that was the plan.

03:02.958 --> 03:06.291
Yeah, well,
I would call that quite remarkable.

03:06.375 --> 03:09.375
(CHUCKLES) Well,
I would say the same about you.

03:17.583 --> 03:18.750
Stephen!

03:24.791 --> 03:26.916
-We're okay. You're okay.
-(SIGHS)

03:46.083 --> 03:51.208
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
Christine. Come on! Christine!

03:54.041 --> 03:57.708
WATCHER:<i> In this universe,</i>
<i>Stephen Strange didn't lose his hands...</i>

03:59.416 --> 04:00.833
<i>...but his heart.</i>

04:02.041 --> 04:07.833
<i>Grief-stricken, Strange sought answers</i>
<i>across the world and in the mystic arts.</i>

04:09.250 --> 04:13.958
"The Eye of Agamotto,
cradle of the temporal singularity

04:14.041 --> 04:19.500
discovered by Cagliostro,
manipulation and alteration of timelines."

04:23.833 --> 04:25.875
-Time travel.
-WONG: What are you doing?

04:25.958 --> 04:29.708
Tinkering with time can weaken
the very fabric of the universe.

04:29.791 --> 04:33.125
We protect reality. We don't threaten it.

04:33.208 --> 04:34.500
WATCHER:<i> And when the threat came</i>

04:35.708 --> 04:38.083
<i>and The Ancient One was lost,</i>

04:38.166 --> 04:39.958
<i>Stephen Strange stood tall.</i>

04:43.916 --> 04:47.250
<i>The man of science</i>
<i>became the Sorcerer Supreme.</i>

04:47.791 --> 04:50.625
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.666
WATCHER:<i> Yet despite all he'd gained,</i>

04:52.750 --> 04:56.166
<i>Stephen Strange could not</i>
<i>let go of the past.</i>

05:00.791 --> 05:04.208
Sorry, but this is now
my favorite T-shirt.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.541
(CHUCKLES) Then I'm gonna
have to take it back.

05:06.625 --> 05:09.041
Hmm, I'd like to see you try.

05:12.083 --> 05:15.166
WONG: Oh!
I see we switched to the cheap stuff.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.291
How long has it been?

05:19.375 --> 05:21.666
(SIGHS) Two years, tonight.

05:22.416 --> 05:23.708
What are you doing up?

05:23.791 --> 05:26.333
Ah, needed the little sorcerer's room.

05:26.416 --> 05:27.416
What are you doing?

05:29.416 --> 05:30.458
Hmm...

05:32.166 --> 05:34.500
Well, I'm going to start the kettle.

05:34.583 --> 05:38.333
I suggest you join me
before you do something reckless.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.416
Evening, handsome.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.125
Uh...

06:10.208 --> 06:11.291
Something wrong?

06:11.375 --> 06:15.541
I, uh, I think I might have just
had a mild cardiac event.

06:15.625 --> 06:19.291
A heart attack, Doctor?
Well, buck up, Strange.

06:19.375 --> 06:21.125
You promised me crème brûlée.

06:21.208 --> 06:24.458
Say the word, Christine,
and I will give you the world.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.166
CHRISTINE: Oh, let me hear it.

06:29.250 --> 06:32.083
Come on, I know you prepared
an acceptance speech for tonight.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.583
I haven't. I'm gonna wing it.

06:33.666 --> 06:36.333
I'm gonna run up to the podium
like a game show contestant.

06:36.416 --> 06:38.583
Cheers and screams, high-fives.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.583
(CHUCKLING) Seriously? Are you teasing me?

06:41.666 --> 06:43.833
Okay. No, you said it.
You have to do it now.

06:43.916 --> 06:45.625
Only if you're by my side.

06:45.708 --> 06:49.041
CHRISTINE: Wait a sec.
Have you ever even seen a game show?

06:49.125 --> 06:51.791
-There's a first time for everything.
-(CHRISTINE CHUCKLES)

06:53.416 --> 06:56.666
-What?
-I don't know. You're being delightful.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.083
I must owe someone a muffin basket
for this personality shift.

07:00.166 --> 07:04.125
Maybe... Maybe you make me happy.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.291
Well, this is shaping up
to be a night to remember.

07:19.208 --> 07:24.000
(GASPS) No, no, no!
Not again. No! Christine!

07:36.333 --> 07:38.041
Evening, handsome.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.541
Your chariot awaits.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.333
Oh, we missed our turn.
Isn't the bridge that way?

07:49.416 --> 07:51.166
Taking a different route.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.208
It's okay. We'll be fine.

07:54.458 --> 07:55.791
(GASPS) Stephen!

07:59.708 --> 08:02.916
You're getting an award.
This whole party is for you.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.666
Let's stay in.
We'll order pizza and crème brûlée.

08:06.750 --> 08:09.458
Oh, no. I am not getting grease
on this dress, okay?

08:09.541 --> 08:13.000
We'll go, we'll dance.
I promise you, we will have a good time.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.750
-(GASPS)
-No.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.375
Oh, pizza. You're a genius.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.166
REPORTER:<i> We're hearing reports</i>
<i>of numerous casualties,</i>

08:46.250 --> 08:49.416
<i>including the death</i>
<i>of one Dr. Christine Palmer.</i>

08:49.500 --> 08:51.958
<i>Palmer, an emergency</i>
<i>and trauma specialist...</i>

08:54.083 --> 08:55.833
Stephen. Something wrong?

08:55.916 --> 08:58.333
(BREATH TREMBLING)
Why does this keep happening?

08:59.208 --> 09:01.083
Aren't we allowed to be happy?

09:02.125 --> 09:04.708
Maybe I should drive. Yeah?

09:05.416 --> 09:07.625
Hey, are you okay? Do you wanna talk?

09:09.083 --> 09:11.208
Maybe put on some music?

09:11.833 --> 09:13.000
I only want you.

09:13.791 --> 09:15.541
You're the only thing that matters.

09:45.333 --> 09:47.833
No!

10:00.291 --> 10:02.791
Good evening, Dr. Strange.

10:02.875 --> 10:04.666
Are you having car trouble?

10:06.458 --> 10:07.541
Why are you here?

10:07.625 --> 10:08.958
ANCIENT ONE: To help you.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.375
This is where it starts for you.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.416
With the death of Dr. Christine Palmer.

10:15.083 --> 10:20.166
So overwhelmed by loss,
you will seek answers in the mystic arts.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.250
In me.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.208
Help me bring her back.

10:23.291 --> 10:26.875
I'm sorry, but I can't. No one can.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.166
Her death is an Absolute Point in time.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.708
Absolute?

10:31.791 --> 10:34.250
Unchangeable. Unmovable.

10:34.333 --> 10:38.041
Without her death, you would never
have defeated Dormammu

10:38.125 --> 10:40.041
and become the Sorcerer Supreme,

10:40.125 --> 10:42.666
and the guardian of the Eye of Agamotto.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.458
If you erase her death,

10:45.541 --> 10:47.666
you never start your journey.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.375
I'm creating a paradox.

10:49.458 --> 10:54.000
You're risking the universe.
You cannot reverse an Absolute Point.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.500
Nothing is impossible. You taught me that.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.666
I only require more power.

10:58.750 --> 11:03.375
The greatest sorcerers of the past
could not reverse an Absolute Point.

11:03.458 --> 11:04.750
You don't know that.

11:04.833 --> 11:07.125
Books have been lost. Libraries destroyed.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.458
Stop torturing yourself, Stephen.

11:09.541 --> 11:11.708
There is no hope here.

11:11.791 --> 11:15.291
Christine is gone. You cannot save her.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.583
No.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.750
Stephen, this path only leads to darkness
and the end of this reality.

11:25.291 --> 11:29.916
Please do not do this,
or I will be forced to stop you.

11:31.208 --> 11:32.625
You'd have to find me first.

11:44.708 --> 11:45.708
Whew.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.708
Uh, excuse me. Hello, excuse me.

11:51.833 --> 11:55.750
I'm looking for the Lost Library
of Cagliostro.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.083
Library?

12:00.375 --> 12:05.083
Hello? You know, books?
Reading? Knowledge?

12:07.333 --> 12:10.416
Hey. Hey! I'm talking here.
Where are you going?

12:28.791 --> 12:31.708
Hmm, no door. Clever.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.500
Hello?

12:37.958 --> 12:39.750
Anyone home?

12:49.125 --> 12:50.708
Hmm, quite the welcome.

13:11.500 --> 13:15.291
You have to be the strangest-dressed
sorcerer I've ever seen.

13:15.958 --> 13:18.125
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) Yeah, it's Armani.

13:18.208 --> 13:20.958
I've come here for Sorcerer Cagliostro.

13:21.041 --> 13:24.416
According to legend, he knew how to break
an Absolute Point in time.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.541
Where can I find Cagliostro?

13:26.625 --> 13:31.916
Well, maybe here, maybe there.
Maybe nowhere.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.333
Wonderful. You're cryptic.
Please tell me you're not Cagliostro.

13:36.416 --> 13:40.791
(CHUCKLES) The name's O'Bengh,
librarian for the books of Cagliostro.

13:40.875 --> 13:44.541
Come, this way, Sorcerer Armani.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.083
No, it's Strange.

13:46.166 --> 13:49.208
O'BENGH: Not any stranger
than any other name in this world.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.708
DR. STRANGE: (GASPS) The lost books.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.666
O'BENGH: How long will you be
staying here?

14:01.333 --> 14:03.041
As long as it takes.

14:10.333 --> 14:14.041
Okay. Transmutation,
telekinesis, teleportation.

14:14.666 --> 14:17.875
Interesting. Time manipulation. Bingo.

14:20.375 --> 14:24.375
"The power required to break
an Absolute Point in time is immense,

14:24.458 --> 14:27.041
"and nigh impossible to obtain."

14:27.125 --> 14:29.125
(SCOFFS) Yeah, no doy.

14:29.208 --> 14:34.291
A-ha! "Gain the power through
the absorption of other beings."

14:34.375 --> 14:35.916
Absorption?

14:39.666 --> 14:40.666
Here we go.

14:48.041 --> 14:50.208
Whoa! Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

14:50.291 --> 14:52.416
My name is Dr. Stephen Strange.

14:52.500 --> 14:56.708
I brought you here
because I need to borrow your powers.

14:56.791 --> 14:59.666
-Do you mind sharing a tentacle or two?
-(SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING)

15:00.625 --> 15:02.041
Please? (SCREAMS)

15:02.125 --> 15:04.458
No!

15:14.333 --> 15:15.333
What happened?

15:16.333 --> 15:18.791
Mystic beings do not bargain.

15:18.875 --> 15:21.166
Their powers are not meant for man.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.541
The Library isn't enough.

15:24.375 --> 15:26.375
Those beings have what I need.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.916
O'BENGH: Is she worth the pain?

15:31.750 --> 15:35.125
A man does not suffer like this
for his own glory.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.583
Every moment of it.

15:40.583 --> 15:44.333
There is a fine line
between devotion and delusion.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.666
Love can break more than your heart.
It can shatter your mind.

15:52.708 --> 15:53.875
Uh-huh.

15:53.958 --> 15:55.583
And in which book did you read that?

15:55.666 --> 16:00.333
(CHUCKLES) No book, Armani.
Life taught me.

16:03.833 --> 16:06.250
Mmm, maybe O'Bengh's right.

16:06.333 --> 16:09.000
If they won't surrender their power,
I'll take it.

16:09.083 --> 16:10.791
-(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
-Let's start small.

16:27.125 --> 16:28.500
All right, what's next?

16:30.541 --> 16:32.000
Nice cape.

16:33.666 --> 16:35.166
But I draw the line at bugs.

16:53.666 --> 16:54.708
More.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.541
WATCHER: <i>He's on the wrong path.</i>

17:24.625 --> 17:27.125
I could warn him, intervene,

17:27.208 --> 17:31.000
but the fate of his universe is not worth
risking the safety of all others.

17:31.666 --> 17:34.458
-Besides, I doubt he'd listen.
-(BREATHING HEAVILY)

17:37.333 --> 17:38.333
(ECHOING) Hello?

17:40.166 --> 17:41.166
Who's that?

18:06.208 --> 18:08.416
Time to meet an old friend.

18:14.541 --> 18:16.583
Hello again and goodbye.

18:50.875 --> 18:52.791
O'Bengh, what happened to you?

18:54.125 --> 18:56.208
Time, Sorcerer Armani.

18:59.958 --> 19:01.000
Put that away.

19:01.666 --> 19:04.916
You used magic to remain frozen
for centuries.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.750
I chose to live.

19:07.833 --> 19:11.458
But I can reverse this.
You will live longer, forever.

19:11.541 --> 19:12.541
Hush!

19:12.625 --> 19:15.666
Even in our world... (COUGHS)

19:16.916 --> 19:18.833
death is part of the plan.

19:20.041 --> 19:22.791
-I can't accept that.
-(CHUCKLES)

19:22.875 --> 19:26.250
(COUGHS) I know, I know.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.875
But maybe the other Strange will.

19:30.750 --> 19:31.750
Other?

19:31.833 --> 19:33.708
O'BENGH: (CHUCKLES) Can't you see?

19:37.291 --> 19:39.000
You are only half a man,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.125
living half a life.

19:45.791 --> 19:48.583
WATCHER:<i> It was true. He wasn't alone.</i>

19:48.666 --> 19:52.583
<i>He wasn't even the only Dr. Strange</i>
<i>in this universe.</i>

19:53.833 --> 19:56.125
Well, I'm going to start the kettle.

19:56.208 --> 19:59.625
I suggest you join me
before you do something reckless.

20:06.875 --> 20:11.166
Um, you're right. Enough living
in the past for one evening.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.125
What was in that whiskey?

20:50.958 --> 20:53.125
-(ECHOING) Hello, Stephen.
-No... Wait a minute. You're...

20:53.208 --> 20:54.333
Dead? Yes!

20:54.416 --> 20:55.708
So, this must be...

20:55.791 --> 20:58.916
A psychic impression
sent through a splinter in reality?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.125
-Mmm!
-Uh...

21:00.208 --> 21:02.041
Yes. Just think of me as an echo.

21:02.125 --> 21:05.125
Huh. Well, I was gonna say that
this must be the end of the world.

21:05.208 --> 21:08.666
(CHUCKLES) That, too.
You always were a perceptive one.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.625
But I fear we don't have much time.

21:10.708 --> 21:12.125
Then who's causing this?

21:13.041 --> 21:15.083
Well, you are.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.291
How?

21:16.375 --> 21:19.833
When Dr. Strange, you, used The Eye

21:19.916 --> 21:22.708
and vanished into the past,
I couldn't follow.

21:23.375 --> 21:26.375
<i>I drew upon the power</i>
<i>of the Dark Dimension</i>

21:26.458 --> 21:30.166
<i>to split the timeline, to split you.</i>

21:30.250 --> 21:32.166
I'm looking for the Lost Library
of Cagliostro.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.000
Enough living in the past for one evening.

21:34.083 --> 21:37.333
Allowing for two of
your possible timelines

21:37.416 --> 21:39.333
to occur in one universe.

21:39.416 --> 21:40.750
Two timelines?

21:40.833 --> 21:43.500
I doubt that's the simplest
or smartest thing to do.

21:43.583 --> 21:45.375
Exceedingly dangerous, actually.

21:45.458 --> 21:47.916
And now I have an evil twin?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.125
More like misguided.

21:50.208 --> 21:54.666
If the other Strange succeeds in reversing
an Absolute Point in our universe...

21:54.750 --> 21:56.125
You mean saving Christine.

21:56.208 --> 21:58.125
You cannot save her, Stephen.

21:58.208 --> 22:02.375
The resulting temporal paradox
will destroy this universe.

22:02.458 --> 22:04.208
Our time is running out.

22:04.291 --> 22:08.416
I fear the only sorcerer strong enough
to stop Dr. Strange is...

22:09.166 --> 22:11.083
you, Dr. Strange.

22:14.166 --> 22:19.125
Okay. Wait. So... (CHUCKLES)
the fabric of reality is breaking,

22:19.208 --> 22:22.083
and only you can stop it
because you are causing it.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.583
(BLOWS) Let's be honest,
we've been through weirder.

22:24.666 --> 22:26.416
But do you want to stop him?

22:27.416 --> 22:30.000
Weren't you in love with this Christine?

22:30.083 --> 22:31.541
I... I think I have to.

22:32.791 --> 22:34.458
At the very least, to save you.

22:35.125 --> 22:40.125
Mmm. The Guardian Vishanti
heavy-duty protection spell.

22:40.208 --> 22:42.541
Knowing me, I'll need it. (GRUNTS)

22:43.666 --> 22:44.833
How would you find him?

22:49.041 --> 22:50.458
He's found me.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.250
-Oh, that's not great.
-Nope, it's not.

22:55.666 --> 22:56.875
WONG: Good luck!

23:14.250 --> 23:15.666
-Hello?
-(WIND BLOWING)

23:17.583 --> 23:19.583
Hello? (ECHOES)

23:29.125 --> 23:30.208
Where am I?

23:35.708 --> 23:37.125
STRANGE SUPREME: The question is,

23:37.875 --> 23:39.250
when are you?

23:39.875 --> 23:42.125
Do not be frightened, old friend,

23:42.916 --> 23:44.625
for we are one and the same.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.583
What happened to you?

23:50.666 --> 23:52.416
I needed you alone.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.166
No need for Wong or The Ancient One.

23:55.250 --> 23:56.583
They wouldn't understand.

23:58.791 --> 24:00.541
They never knew her.

24:01.625 --> 24:05.083
We knew her. We loved her.

24:05.166 --> 24:09.000
You can't bring her back.
The world out there is breaking.

24:09.083 --> 24:12.125
Don't you dare lie to me. I am you!

24:20.750 --> 24:23.500
How many nights did we sit
in the Sanctum Sanctorum,

24:23.583 --> 24:26.000
Time Stone in the palm of our hand,

24:26.083 --> 24:29.083
knowing we could go back,
gathering the courage?

24:29.666 --> 24:31.875
Well, I had the courage.

24:31.958 --> 24:36.541
I spent centuries,
sacrificed everything for Christine.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.208
(SIGHS) And now can you save her?

24:41.291 --> 24:42.916
-No, Stephen.
-(WARBLES)

24:43.833 --> 24:45.333
We can.

24:50.166 --> 24:53.083
Our powers are diluted, split between us.

24:53.166 --> 24:58.416
But once we become whole again,
we can save her.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.625
We can't.

24:59.708 --> 25:03.458
You don't believe it's possible.
But you will see.

25:03.541 --> 25:05.541
The Ancient One warned us.

25:05.625 --> 25:08.458
If we save Christine,
we destroy the world.

25:08.541 --> 25:13.208
(SIGHS) I told you,
she doesn't understand. We love Christine.

25:13.291 --> 25:16.208
This isn't love. Look at this.

25:16.291 --> 25:18.833
This is arrogance.
This is our need to fix everything.

25:18.916 --> 25:21.666
It's what drove us to study
the mystic arts in the first place.

25:21.750 --> 25:24.041
And look where we are.

25:24.125 --> 25:25.583
Deranged.

25:25.666 --> 25:27.208
I will be whole again.

25:27.291 --> 25:30.916
-No. Your marbles are long gone.
-(STRANGE SUPREME GROANS)

25:31.000 --> 25:33.333
The world, however, still stands a chance.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.250
You can't save her. She's dead.

25:56.833 --> 25:58.041
You need to let go.

25:58.125 --> 26:01.875
I've gone too far to turn back now.

27:54.208 --> 27:57.416
(SIGHS) It's so good to see you.

28:03.708 --> 28:05.125
-Christine?
-CHRISTINE: Mmm?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.333
Stephen, you promised me crème brûlée.

28:09.958 --> 28:11.250
I know.

28:11.875 --> 28:13.666
We can be together again.

28:17.958 --> 28:19.500
Stephen, I love you.

28:26.541 --> 28:27.958
I love you.

28:30.291 --> 28:32.750
I wish that was true. But you're...

28:32.833 --> 28:34.416
You're not her.

28:55.958 --> 28:57.833
You can't do this.

28:57.916 --> 29:00.416
But we must.

29:00.500 --> 29:01.500
No.

29:05.833 --> 29:07.458
No!

29:54.166 --> 29:55.416
Christine?

29:56.250 --> 29:59.333
-Christine.
-What? Oh...

30:00.125 --> 30:01.666
It's me, Christine.

30:02.833 --> 30:06.291
Oh, my God. What's happening?
What's happening?

30:06.375 --> 30:09.791
DR. STRANGE:
I brought you back. I saved you.

30:09.875 --> 30:13.125
No, this is... This...
This isn't real! This is...

30:13.208 --> 30:17.500
No, this is a nightmare!
(SCREAMS) No, no! Leave me!

30:18.166 --> 30:20.916
-No. I can fix this.
-No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No!

30:21.000 --> 30:23.500
Get away! Don't touch me!

30:23.583 --> 30:24.583
Uh... Uh... Christine.

30:24.666 --> 30:26.041
-CHRISTINE: No!
-Christine.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.708
-CHRISTINE: No!
-No!

30:27.791 --> 30:31.375
-(BREATH TREMBLING)
-No! This wasn't supposed to happen.

30:31.458 --> 30:33.916
-Stephen. No. Stephen.
-No. No.

30:34.541 --> 30:35.666
What is going on?

30:37.166 --> 30:39.333
No!

30:47.250 --> 30:49.291
You... You can stop this.

30:50.083 --> 30:52.458
Please, fix this.

30:52.541 --> 30:54.541
The same way you fixed Christine?

30:54.625 --> 30:56.708
-What?
-I was wrong. I...

30:56.791 --> 30:57.791
WATCHER: You were warned.

30:57.875 --> 30:59.333
I know. But the world!

31:00.166 --> 31:02.833
The world shouldn't pay for my arrogance.

31:02.916 --> 31:06.000
I read about you. Sensed your presence.

31:06.083 --> 31:08.583
You're a god. You can undo this.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.583
I'm not a god. And neither are you.

31:11.666 --> 31:16.375
Then punish me.
Not the world, not Christine.

31:16.458 --> 31:20.125
Honestly, if I could fix this,
if I could punish you instead, I would.

31:20.208 --> 31:21.750
But I can't interfere.

31:21.833 --> 31:24.166
You, more than anyone else,
should understand that

31:24.250 --> 31:29.291
meddling with time and events
only leads to more destruction.

31:29.375 --> 31:31.875
No. No!

31:31.958 --> 31:33.375
(GROANS) What?

31:33.458 --> 31:35.375
I didn't mean for this to happen!

31:58.000 --> 32:00.708
-Christine. Oh, no.
-(BREATHING HEAVILY)

32:01.375 --> 32:02.458
I'm sorry.

32:03.125 --> 32:04.291
Stephen.

32:07.125 --> 32:08.625
What did you do?

32:10.583 --> 32:13.291
No, no, no, no, no.

32:19.583 --> 32:20.750
I'm sorry.

32:21.625 --> 32:24.833
I am so, so sorry.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.291
WATCHER:<i> One life, one choice, one moment</i>

32:32.375 --> 32:35.208
<i>can destroy the entire universe.</i>
