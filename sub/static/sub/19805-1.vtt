01:04.665 --> 01:06.665
Well, Cooper, thanks.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.802
This was fun.

01:09.804 --> 01:15.707
- Well, maybe we can
do it again sometime.

01:15.709 --> 01:19.511
- Yeah, yeah, totally.

01:19.513 --> 01:25.451

Jon snow.

03:28.475 --> 03:32.544
You know, game of thrones.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.681
- Oh, I've never seen it.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.550
- Huh, no shit.

03:38.552 --> 03:42.387
Okay, well, do you
want me to take him out

03:42.389 --> 03:44.356
so you can meet him?

03:44.358 --> 03:49.561
- No, I'm--

03:49.563 --> 03:51.563
I don't rally know
what I'm doing here.

04:03.743 --> 04:07.012
- There he is.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.747
- Okay, so if you had to choose,

04:08.749 --> 04:15.721
would you rather be eaten
by a shark or burnt alive?

04:15.723 --> 04:17.255
- Why do I have to choose?

04:17.257 --> 04:22.394
- Because you do.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.429
- I'm gonna go with shark.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.897
- Really?

04:25.899 --> 04:29.735
Interesting.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.270
I've missed you.

04:37.810 --> 04:41.280
What's with you?

04:41.282 --> 04:42.581
- I don't know.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.450
Just a funk I guess.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.485
- Yeah, well, that's why god

04:46.487 --> 04:50.489
invented distilled
beer, my friend.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.791
Hello, Joyce, how's
life treating you?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.793
- Life, what life?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.461
All I do is work.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.463
- Well, at least you've
got your health, right?

04:58.465 --> 05:05.837
- Oh, yeah, I'm a
regular fairy Princess.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.406
- Okay, so what do priests

05:07.408 --> 05:11.443
and Christmas trees
both have in common?

05:11.445 --> 05:13.779
Ah, hello?

05:13.781 --> 05:19.751
What do priests and Christmas
trees both have in common?

05:19.753 --> 05:24.089
Their balls are
only for decoration.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.791
Oh come on, that's it?

05:25.793 --> 05:27.926
That's all I get?

05:27.928 --> 05:30.896
But you are laughing
on the inside, right?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.764
- In tears.

05:32.766 --> 05:33.765
- Liar.

05:45.745 --> 05:48.847
- Hey.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.449
- Hey.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.651
- Can I get something for you?

05:52.653 --> 05:54.653
- Yeah, campari and soda.

06:43.636 --> 06:49.141
- Another one under the
bridge, as they say, right?

06:49.143 --> 06:52.077
How was your night?

06:52.079 --> 06:54.146
- It was long.

06:54.148 --> 06:57.015
- Well, tomorrow's another day.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.551
Okay, I hope you have
a wonderful evening.

07:11.564 --> 07:13.632
- You look tired.

07:13.634 --> 07:17.936
- Oh, yeah, well how
about you lick my balls?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.070
- You want something?

07:30.917 --> 07:32.951
So, you want me to lock up?

07:32.953 --> 07:35.620
- Well, I'm sure as
shit not gonna do it.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.189
See you tomorrow.

07:37.191 --> 07:41.927
Don't forget to turn
off the damn lights.

08:30.042 --> 08:34.145
- So, Jon.

08:34.147 --> 08:40.619
What the hell am I doing here?

08:44.691 --> 08:48.527
Yeah.

08:48.529 --> 08:55.667
I don't know either.

08:55.669 --> 09:01.973
- Well, look who's back.

09:01.975 --> 09:05.176
You want to meet him?

09:05.178 --> 09:06.711
It's no big deal.

09:13.686 --> 09:17.856
- I can't.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.892
- Are you sure?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.328
- Yeah, thanks.

10:10.676 --> 10:16.114
- There he is.

10:16.116 --> 10:20.652
- Okay, so how do gay
horses greet each other?

10:20.654 --> 10:21.953
- I do not know.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.088
- Hay!

10:25.792 --> 10:28.126
So, my friend,
what's new with you?

10:28.128 --> 10:31.229
- Since yesterday?

10:31.231 --> 10:32.731
Not a whole lot.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.233
- You know, for a bartender,
you're really shitty

10:35.235 --> 10:38.069
at making small talk.

10:38.071 --> 10:44.242
- That is probably true.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.644
Is it a special occasion?

10:45.646 --> 10:47.245
- Actually, this is for you?

10:47.247 --> 10:48.380
- Really?

10:48.382 --> 10:49.914
- Yes, sir, open it.

10:57.690 --> 10:58.390
- I don't get it.

10:58.392 --> 10:59.824
- Happy anniversary.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.160
- What?

11:02.162 --> 11:02.160
- You've been working for
this fine establishment

11:02.162 --> 11:11.036
for exactly 10 years
so happy anniversary.

11:11.038 --> 11:11.836
- What?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.238
How did you know that?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.173
- Well, you started
working here the same day

11:15.175 --> 11:17.876
that my divorce from my
third wife was finalized

11:17.878 --> 11:23.982
and trust me that's a day you
don't forget any damn soon.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.050
Are you gonna say something

11:25.052 --> 11:30.021
or just stare at
it all night long?

11:30.023 --> 11:37.062
- Fuck.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.697
- So, 10 years, huh?

11:38.699 --> 11:39.297
Wow.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.966
- Yeah.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.135
Guess so.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.137
- That is really
something, you know that?

11:46.139 --> 11:48.173
Gosh, I guess we
are turning into

11:48.175 --> 11:49.708
a bunch of old farts you and I.

12:06.192 --> 12:10.195
- Hey.

12:10.197 --> 12:13.198
- Hey.

12:13.200 --> 12:18.770
- Campari and soda, right?

12:18.772 --> 12:20.105
- Sure, thanks.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.805
- One more?

12:53.807 --> 12:55.140
- Nah, time to go.

13:01.914 --> 13:05.950
Until we meet again, kind sir.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.952
- Have a good night, Ron.

13:24.570 --> 13:29.974
Good book?

13:29.976 --> 13:36.581
- It's okay.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.984
- "Woman in the dunes".

13:39.986 --> 13:41.319
What's that about?

13:48.060 --> 13:50.962
- Sand.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.365
- Sand?

13:54.367 --> 13:55.500
That sounds really interesting.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.179
Okay then, another drink?

14:17.056 --> 14:20.959
- No, thanks.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.294
- Okay.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.963
You have a great night.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.608
- Jon.

14:36.610 --> 14:41.646
I hope you don't mind having
processed food products.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.129
Oh, hey.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.430
- Check you out.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.399
Can't seem to stay away, huh?

15:34.401 --> 15:35.667
- Huh?

15:35.669 --> 15:41.205
Oh, yes.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.573
Did Jon get adopted?

15:42.575 --> 15:49.247
'Cause he's not at his kennel.

15:49.249 --> 15:52.717
He's okay, right?

15:52.719 --> 15:58.122
- I'm sorry.

15:58.124 --> 16:04.295
- What?

16:04.297 --> 16:07.231
- We--

16:07.233 --> 16:11.469
we fight like hell to
try to save them all

16:11.471 --> 16:16.307
but there's just too many

16:16.309 --> 16:20.278
and not enough space.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.412
I'm so so sorry.

16:59.084 --> 17:00.485
- Hello.

17:09.328 --> 17:15.333
Can I get something for you?

17:15.335 --> 17:18.603
- Yeah.

17:18.605 --> 17:24.709
- The usual?

17:24.711 --> 17:30.715
- No, something stronger.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.351
- Okay.

17:33.353 --> 17:38.623
What can I get for you?

17:38.625 --> 17:45.630
- Bourbon or whiskey,
i don't really care.

17:45.632 --> 17:51.169
- Alright, a bourbon or
whiskey coming right up.

18:03.449 --> 18:04.515
- Thanks.

18:20.532 --> 18:25.203
- Hey, are you okay?

18:25.205 --> 18:26.537
- Yeah, I'm fine.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.280
- Hey buddy, how's it going?

18:36.282 --> 18:37.281
- Hey, Ron.

19:12.417 --> 19:17.455
Hey.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.589
Hey, are you okay?

19:25.831 --> 19:32.737
- Yeah, I'm fine.

19:32.739 --> 19:35.206
I'll take another.

19:35.208 --> 19:38.643
- Yeah, that's probably
not a good idea.

19:38.645 --> 19:43.181
- Whatever.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.515
Play it again, Sam.

19:51.757 --> 19:56.661
- Sorry but I can't do it.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.797
- Why?

19:59.799 --> 20:06.837
I'm fine.

20:06.839 --> 20:11.209
- Excuse me for a second.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.310
What's up?

20:12.312 --> 20:12.310
- Guy at table 12

20:12.312 --> 20:16.847
says he can't taste the
alcohol in his drink.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.482
- It's a long island ice tea.

20:18.484 --> 20:19.951
What the fuck does
he think is in it?

20:19.953 --> 20:21.419
- I know, I know.

20:21.421 --> 20:25.323
But can't you just
fix it for me, please?

20:25.325 --> 20:32.697
- Yeah, sure.

20:32.699 --> 20:36.834
There you go, happy?

20:36.836 --> 20:37.635
- Thank you.

20:58.957 --> 21:03.394
- I really need to get laid.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.762
What?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.364
You?

21:06.366 --> 21:09.400
Shit, in your dreams maybe.

21:20.812 --> 21:22.713
- What?

21:22.715 --> 21:26.651
- Why are you so
sad all the time?

21:26.653 --> 21:28.753
- I'm not sad all the time.

21:28.755 --> 21:35.393
- Shit, like hell you're not.

21:35.395 --> 21:38.562
- So, any chance you
wanted to lock up tonight?

21:38.564 --> 21:41.966
- Any chance you
want to bite my ass?

21:41.968 --> 21:49.507
Oh, and don't forget,
bugman comes tonight.

22:18.771 --> 22:19.770
- Shut up.

22:35.787 --> 22:38.989
Hi.

22:38.991 --> 22:39.990
- Hi.

22:50.502 --> 22:54.572
Okay, okay, okay.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.707
Sorry.

22:56.709 --> 23:03.414
We need to call you a cab or
an uber or something, right?

23:03.416 --> 23:06.550
- Fuck uber.

23:06.552 --> 23:13.124
- You seriously can't stay here.

23:13.126 --> 23:17.561
- Can I have a glass of water?

23:17.563 --> 23:18.896
- Yeah, okay, okay.

23:27.639 --> 23:28.773
Look, so, I'm thinking--

23:28.775 --> 23:29.774
no, no, no, no.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.742
Hey, you need to get up.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.843
Look, you need to get up.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.512
No, you can't stay here.

23:34.514 --> 23:38.582
Up, up.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.752
- You're an asshole.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.888
- Look, listen.

23:43.890 --> 23:48.125
You can't stay here, okay?

23:48.127 --> 23:49.093
- I just want to sleep.

23:49.095 --> 23:49.894
- No, no, no, no.

23:49.896 --> 23:53.097
- Hey.

23:53.099 --> 23:59.003
- Hey.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.705
What?

24:01.707 --> 24:04.041
- Nothing, bro.

24:04.043 --> 24:07.611
I can come by next week
if you want, no sweat.

24:07.613 --> 24:10.948
- No.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.551
Hey, hey.

24:13.553 --> 24:17.755
You need to go home.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.623
- Seriously bro, I can
come back next week.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.091
- No, alright?

24:21.093 --> 24:23.761
Just--

24:23.763 --> 24:24.895
I'll take care of this.

24:34.739 --> 24:35.940
Okay, okay.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.940
- Thank you.

25:09.942 --> 25:14.712
- Get some sleep.

25:46.044 --> 25:49.880
Hey.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.982
Hey!

25:51.984 --> 25:53.751
- What?

25:53.753 --> 25:57.187
- Where are you going?

25:57.189 --> 25:58.822
- Home.

25:58.824 --> 26:02.026
- Well, do you want a ride?

26:02.028 --> 26:03.694
- No, I'm fine.

26:03.696 --> 26:10.668
- Are you sure?

26:10.670 --> 26:15.606
Fine, fine, whatever.

26:15.608 --> 26:20.678
- You sure you don't mind?

26:20.680 --> 26:21.679
- Yeah.

26:33.692 --> 26:35.893
- I'm not an alcoholic,
if that's what you think.

26:35.895 --> 26:38.929
- That's not what I think.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.764
- I don't even drink really.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.900
- I don't know why you
care what I think anyway.

26:42.902 --> 26:48.372
- I don't.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.374
- You want to get some coffee?

27:14.899 --> 27:20.070
Do you want to talk
about anything?

27:20.072 --> 27:22.740
- I don't even know you.

27:22.742 --> 27:26.110
- Okay.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.645
- Are you done?

27:35.120 --> 27:36.987
So what are you?

27:36.989 --> 27:40.924
Like some sort of
actor or something?

27:40.926 --> 27:42.126
- What?

27:42.128 --> 27:46.830
Where's that coming from?

27:46.832 --> 27:48.332
- Isn't everyone who
works in a restaurant

27:48.334 --> 27:51.335
some sort of actor?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.704
- No, they're not.

27:53.706 --> 27:57.975
And no, I'm not an actor.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.778
- Okay.

28:00.780 --> 28:07.151
So, what's your deal then?

28:07.153 --> 28:14.191
- My deal?

28:14.193 --> 28:18.362
Well, if you must know,

28:18.364 --> 28:22.966
I'm working on an algorithm

28:22.968 --> 28:28.138
that can predict
within 99% accuracy

28:28.140 --> 28:30.140
the exact moment
you're gonna die.

28:36.247 --> 28:38.248
- You're an ass.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.251
- That is the only smart
thing you've said all day.

28:50.095 --> 28:54.998
I am nothing.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.303
Just a bartender, that's it.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.838
It's all there is.

29:26.131 --> 29:29.900
Wanna hear a joke?

29:29.902 --> 29:34.271
How do gay horses
greet each other?

29:34.273 --> 29:40.277
Hay!

30:26.357 --> 30:32.095
Wow, cool place.

30:32.097 --> 30:35.399
- It's okay.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.001
Okay.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.870
Thanks.

30:39.872 --> 30:46.109
- I don't even know your name.

30:46.111 --> 30:49.413
- Daisy.

30:49.415 --> 30:53.450
Yes, really.

30:53.452 --> 30:58.121
- What a great name.

30:58.123 --> 30:59.122
- Not really.

31:13.004 --> 31:15.906
- Did you know that if you live
in a major metropolitan area

31:15.908 --> 31:17.441
and you've been
married for over a year

31:17.443 --> 31:19.910
the chances of you getting
laid more than once a week

31:19.912 --> 31:23.981
are the same as your getting
killed in a drive-by?

31:23.983 --> 31:25.983
- I did not.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.484
- The only difference is
that with the drive-by

31:27.486 --> 31:31.488
at least it's over quick.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.290
- Well, I will definitely
keep that in mind.

31:44.435 --> 31:45.369
Hey.

31:45.371 --> 31:49.640
- Hey.

31:49.642 --> 31:54.444
- And how are you on
this fine evening?

31:54.446 --> 31:56.413
- Good.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.482
- Usual?

31:58.484 --> 32:00.017
- Sure, thanks.

32:25.376 --> 32:30.213
What?

32:30.215 --> 32:31.214
- Nothing.

32:44.162 --> 32:45.362
- How is everything?

33:00.445 --> 33:02.112
- What?

33:02.114 --> 33:06.249
- Would you like another one?

33:06.251 --> 33:12.522
- No, thanks.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.324
What?

33:14.326 --> 33:18.128
- Nothing.

33:18.130 --> 33:21.331
- Daisy?

33:21.333 --> 33:22.265
- Hey.

33:22.267 --> 33:23.767
- What are you doing here?

33:23.769 --> 33:27.771
- I'm just grabbing a drink.

33:27.773 --> 33:31.008
- Are you
living out here now?

33:31.010 --> 33:33.210
- Yeah, you too I guess?

33:33.212 --> 33:35.679
- Yeah, I am doing financing.

33:35.681 --> 33:38.515
It's like whatever but you
know, money's pretty sick.

33:38.517 --> 33:39.449
How are you?

33:39.451 --> 33:40.517
What have you been up to?

33:40.519 --> 33:46.056
- I'm kinda figuring it out.

33:46.058 --> 33:49.359
- Cool, well, do you
want to come join us?

33:49.361 --> 33:54.631
- Yeah, thanks but i
was just on my way out.

33:54.633 --> 33:57.467
- Well, you know what, we
definitely got to hook up,

33:57.469 --> 33:59.202
get a drink sometime.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.505
- Okay, yeah, sure.

34:01.507 --> 34:02.506
- Cool.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.829
- Gosh.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.831
I don't know about you
mister but I am whooped.

34:34.639 --> 34:38.208
Hello?

34:38.210 --> 34:39.743
- What?

34:39.745 --> 34:43.547
- Wow, someone's in a mood.

34:43.549 --> 34:46.248
That's okay.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.819
You know what I always say,
tomorrow is another day.

34:48.821 --> 34:51.420
- Yeah, no shit.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.291
- You know what, go
fuck yourself, okay?

34:54.293 --> 34:56.525
Fuck off!

34:56.527 --> 34:57.527
Fuck.

36:24.382 --> 36:27.384
- Yeah, hi.

36:27.386 --> 36:28.385
- Hi.

36:37.328 --> 36:39.496
- Cool light, is it--

36:39.498 --> 36:45.335
- what are you doing here?

36:45.337 --> 36:46.670
- I have no idea.

36:55.279 --> 37:01.418
Yeah, so, anyway, this
is weird so I am gonna--

37:01.420 --> 37:03.220
- do you want to come in?

37:03.222 --> 37:04.554
- Yeah, sure.

37:17.435 --> 37:21.338
You play?

37:21.340 --> 37:26.743
- A little, yeah.

37:26.745 --> 37:33.350
So, why are you here?

37:33.352 --> 37:36.353
- I just, you know,

37:36.355 --> 37:39.356
needed to get out of
the house, you know.

37:47.331 --> 37:49.699
- Well, I was actually
just on my way out

37:49.701 --> 37:51.701
to get something to eat, so.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.903
- Oh, I'm sorry, yes.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.906
So, sorry, I didn't
mean to bother you

37:56.908 --> 38:00.410
and I hope I didn't
freak you out.

38:00.412 --> 38:04.614
- You can come if you want.

38:04.616 --> 38:08.318
- Really?

38:08.320 --> 38:10.420
- If you want.

38:10.422 --> 38:15.558
- Okay.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.693
So, are we walking?

38:38.516 --> 38:41.818
So, you're a musician?

38:41.820 --> 38:44.421
- What?

38:44.423 --> 38:47.090
- The guitar.

38:47.092 --> 38:50.427
- No, just a hobby.

38:50.429 --> 38:56.800
- Oh, okay.

38:56.802 --> 39:03.340
So what do you do?

39:03.342 --> 39:07.344
- I'm kinda in between
things right now.

39:07.346 --> 39:12.449
- Well, I am envious.

39:12.451 --> 39:17.620
- Of what?

39:17.622 --> 39:21.658
- Not working, I guess.

39:21.660 --> 39:24.861
- Then quit your job.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.863
- Yeah, not really that simple.

39:37.441 --> 39:45.148
- Well, bartending seems like
it's probably pretty fun.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.484
- I don't know.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.652
It's okay, I guess.

39:49.654 --> 39:55.892
I mean, it pays the bills.

39:55.894 --> 39:59.062
Actually, that's bullshit.

39:59.064 --> 40:02.599
No, I hate it.

40:02.601 --> 40:07.404
I really fucking hate it.

40:07.406 --> 40:13.176
- So, why don't you do
something else then?

40:13.178 --> 40:21.017
- I have no idea.

40:21.019 --> 40:27.924
- Wow, that's
fucking depressing.

40:44.876 --> 40:47.577
- Isn't your place
back this way?

40:47.579 --> 40:49.078
- Yeah.

40:49.080 --> 40:53.450
- So, where are we going?

40:53.452 --> 40:55.952
- I don't know.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.455
What, I like to walk.

41:56.014 --> 42:00.783
I could have saved him.

42:00.785 --> 42:04.854
- Sorry, what?

42:04.856 --> 42:05.855
- Nothing.

42:13.631 --> 42:17.267
- Hey, are you okay?

42:17.269 --> 42:25.108
- Yeah.

42:25.110 --> 42:28.711
- Can I ask you a favor?

42:28.713 --> 42:30.914
- What?

42:30.916 --> 42:34.684
- Tell me something about you.

42:34.686 --> 42:36.052
- No, that's stupid.

42:36.054 --> 42:39.756
- Come on.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.724
Anything.

42:41.726 --> 42:43.593
Where you were born?

42:43.595 --> 42:49.933
Your first car, anything.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.569
- No.

42:52.571 --> 42:54.671
Why?

42:54.673 --> 42:57.740
- Because I wanna know
something about you.

42:57.742 --> 42:59.742
Even if it's completely
insignificant.

43:05.983 --> 43:10.153
Come on.

43:10.155 --> 43:13.256
Anything.

43:13.258 --> 43:21.064
It doesn't have to be important.

43:21.066 --> 43:27.870
- I'm an ass.

43:27.872 --> 43:30.907
- Yeah, me too.

44:00.371 --> 44:04.641
- Hey.

44:04.643 --> 44:09.779
- Hey.

44:09.781 --> 44:12.682
- What are you doing?

44:12.684 --> 44:17.754
- Nothing.

44:17.756 --> 44:21.224
How did you get here?

44:21.226 --> 44:24.027
- I walked.

44:24.029 --> 44:26.696
What?

44:26.698 --> 44:31.300
I told you I like to walk.

44:31.302 --> 44:34.337
- Okay.

44:34.339 --> 44:39.842
Where are you walking to?

44:39.844 --> 44:42.945
- Just around.

44:42.947 --> 44:46.883
- Well, do you
want some company?

44:46.885 --> 44:48.217
- I guess.

45:04.068 --> 45:09.138
I'm not having sex with you.

45:09.140 --> 45:11.474
- Excuse me?

45:11.476 --> 45:17.080
- You heard me.

45:17.082 --> 45:22.318
- Okay.

45:22.320 --> 45:27.724
- I'm serious, I'm not
interested in that.

45:27.726 --> 45:30.393
Like

45:30.395 --> 45:33.029
at all.

45:33.031 --> 45:35.998
- Alright, yeah.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.133
I get it, okay?

45:46.143 --> 45:52.749
So, who's the guy
from the other night?

45:52.751 --> 45:54.283
- What guy?

45:54.285 --> 45:55.952
- The guy from the bar.

45:55.954 --> 45:59.122
- Oh.

45:59.124 --> 46:01.924
Nobody.

46:01.926 --> 46:04.360
Just somebody i
went to school with.

46:04.362 --> 46:10.900
- Alright.

46:10.902 --> 46:12.902
So, where did you go to school?

46:20.911 --> 46:22.879
What?

46:22.881 --> 46:27.817
Did you go to
Harvard or something?

46:27.819 --> 46:31.220
Seriously, Harvard?

46:31.222 --> 46:35.091
- Yale.

46:35.093 --> 46:36.959
What?

46:36.961 --> 46:41.130
It's just a school.

46:41.132 --> 46:46.936
- I mean, no, not really.

46:46.938 --> 46:50.173
- Whatever.

46:50.175 --> 46:52.408
- Why are you being
so weird about it?

46:52.410 --> 46:55.411
- I'm not.

46:55.413 --> 46:58.281
It's just not a big deal.

46:58.283 --> 47:00.483
- Yeah, it
actually kind of is.

47:00.485 --> 47:05.822
I mean, it's a really good
school, you should be proud.

47:05.824 --> 47:09.358
- Why?

47:09.360 --> 47:14.931
I fucking hate those people.

47:14.933 --> 47:21.571
- Wow.

47:21.573 --> 47:23.840
- You're such an asshole.

47:27.879 --> 47:30.947
- Maybe.

47:30.949 --> 47:33.950
But I'm not an Ivy
league asshole.

48:07.384 --> 48:13.189
- So, how old are you anyway?

48:13.191 --> 48:16.225
- Where is that coming from?

48:16.227 --> 48:18.227
How old are you?

48:18.229 --> 48:24.166
- I asked first.

48:24.168 --> 48:29.071
Really, how old are you?

48:29.073 --> 48:33.042
- Honestly I don't know.

48:33.044 --> 48:34.677
- You don't know
how old you are?

48:34.679 --> 48:39.181
- No.

48:39.183 --> 48:45.955
- Okay, then, well, what
year where you born in?

48:45.957 --> 48:50.526
- Do you mind if we talk
about something else?

48:50.528 --> 48:50.526
What?

48:50.528 --> 48:55.464
It's just not really
something I even think about.

48:55.466 --> 48:58.100
Okay?

48:58.102 --> 49:01.137
- Okay.

49:01.139 --> 49:03.539
- I hope you're
enjoying yourself.

49:03.541 --> 49:06.542
- What?

49:06.544 --> 49:09.078
It's just a little
weird, that's all.

49:09.080 --> 49:12.415
- You are really one to talk.

49:35.405 --> 49:38.507
So, you want a ride home?

49:38.509 --> 49:41.077
- No, I'm okay.

49:41.079 --> 49:46.248
- Okay.

49:46.250 --> 49:53.189
- Are you working tonight?

49:53.191 --> 49:56.092
- Unfortunately.

49:56.094 --> 50:00.363
- Okay.

50:00.365 --> 50:01.497
Maybe I'll drop by.

50:13.677 --> 50:16.612
- Alright, so this
pirate walks into a bar

50:16.614 --> 50:19.515
with a ship's wheel hanging
from the end of his pecker.

50:19.517 --> 50:21.617
So the bartender
says to the pirate,

50:21.619 --> 50:24.487
"hey buddy, do you know
that you have a ship's wheel

50:24.489 --> 50:26.622
"hanging from the
end of your penis?"

50:26.624 --> 50:33.496
So the pirate says, "i
know, it drives me nuts."

50:33.498 --> 50:35.698
- Well, you've a
real talent, man.

50:35.700 --> 50:37.233
- Oh yeah?

50:37.235 --> 50:39.201
- Yeah, unfortunately
it's just not for comedy.

50:39.203 --> 50:47.209
- Gee, thanks asshole.

50:47.211 --> 50:48.144
- Hello.

50:48.146 --> 50:50.780
- Hey.

50:50.782 --> 50:53.382
- New book?

50:53.384 --> 50:56.085
- Oh yeah.

50:56.087 --> 51:00.689
- Just a little chicklet?

51:00.691 --> 51:04.160
- Exactly.

51:04.162 --> 51:06.562
- The usual?

51:06.564 --> 51:07.696
- Sure, why not?

51:20.377 --> 51:27.383
Thanks.

51:27.385 --> 51:30.386
- New friend and a famous
writer nevertheless.

51:30.388 --> 51:31.554
- Who?

51:31.556 --> 51:37.193
- The girl, that's
Daisy karr, right?

51:37.195 --> 51:39.628
- I mean, her name is Daisy.

51:39.630 --> 51:42.698
- Daisy karr?

51:42.700 --> 51:45.301
- I guess so.

51:45.303 --> 51:47.837
- I'm impressed but
I've got to ask, dude,

51:47.839 --> 51:50.106
what's somebody like
Daisy karr doing

51:50.108 --> 51:54.410
hanging out with a
goofball like you?

51:54.412 --> 51:57.113
- Wait, how do
you know her name?

51:57.115 --> 51:59.448
- Well, for one, she's famous

51:59.450 --> 52:05.788
and two, despite my rigid
exterior, I read books.

52:05.790 --> 52:10.793
You mean, you don't
know who she is?

52:10.795 --> 52:15.631
Shit, well, her book was a
New York times best-seller

52:15.633 --> 52:19.301
and won all kinds
of fancy awards

52:19.303 --> 52:20.769
and if you believe all the hype

52:20.771 --> 52:23.772
she's supposed to be some
sort of genius or something.

52:32.849 --> 52:34.683
- Hey.

52:34.685 --> 52:35.818
- Oh, hey.

52:44.194 --> 52:47.196
What's up?

52:47.198 --> 52:52.301
- Nothing, you want another one?

52:52.303 --> 52:57.740
- No, I'm okay, thanks.

52:57.742 --> 53:00.676
Are you around tomorrow?

53:00.678 --> 53:04.647
- Yeah.

53:04.649 --> 53:07.449
- Maybe go for a
walk or something.

53:07.451 --> 53:08.584
- Yeah, sure, cool.

53:54.297 --> 53:56.799
- Coop!

53:56.801 --> 53:59.268
Hey, holy shit man.

53:59.270 --> 54:02.238
- Hey, man.
- It has been long time.

54:02.240 --> 54:03.405
How the fuck are you doing?

54:03.407 --> 54:05.808
- I'm good,
yeah, I'm good.

54:05.810 --> 54:10.446
- What the hell are you up to?

54:10.448 --> 54:13.682
- I mean, still serving drinks.

54:13.684 --> 54:17.620
- Oh, shit, wow.

54:17.622 --> 54:19.588
You've been there--

54:19.590 --> 54:25.027
- 10 years.

54:25.029 --> 54:26.929
What about you,
what are you doing?

54:26.931 --> 54:31.433
- I'm actually a teacher the
last couple of years, yeah.

54:31.435 --> 54:34.737
Yeah, I know, me
inspiring little minds.

54:34.739 --> 54:37.006
It's fucking scary, right?

54:37.008 --> 54:41.377
Hey, have you ever
thought about it?

54:41.379 --> 54:44.546
- Teaching?

54:44.548 --> 54:45.948
Not really, no.

54:45.950 --> 54:48.284
- Well, my school's always
looking for substitutes,

54:48.286 --> 54:51.787
so if you're ever
interested give me a shout.

54:51.789 --> 54:53.489
Look, I'll be honest.

54:53.491 --> 54:55.724
Subbing sucks, okay?

54:55.726 --> 54:58.427
The pay blows and people
treat you like shit

54:58.429 --> 55:00.663
but it's a really good way
to put your foot in the door.

55:00.665 --> 55:05.067
So, send me your resume,
I'll pass it along.

55:05.069 --> 55:06.502
- That's nice of you, man.

55:06.504 --> 55:10.572
I mean, hey, maybe I will.

55:10.574 --> 55:12.441
- It was really good
to see you, you know.

55:12.443 --> 55:13.042
- You too.

55:13.044 --> 55:13.976
- Take care of yourself.

55:13.978 --> 55:14.977
- Thanks.

56:18.875 --> 56:20.109
- Hey.

56:20.111 --> 56:23.645
- Oh, hey.

56:23.647 --> 56:25.881
- What?

56:25.883 --> 56:29.385
Is someone here?

56:29.387 --> 56:32.588
- No.

56:32.590 --> 56:35.023
- Well, can I come in?

56:35.025 --> 56:36.558
- Yeah, yeah.

56:44.834 --> 56:47.069
- What are you doing?

56:47.071 --> 56:51.707
- Nothing.

56:51.709 --> 56:53.742
- Okay.

56:53.744 --> 56:58.514
Well, did you want to go
for a walk or something?

56:58.516 --> 56:59.848
- Yeah, sure.

57:26.176 --> 57:28.710
- What is up with you?

57:28.712 --> 57:29.845
- Nothing, why?

57:40.557 --> 57:48.597
So, I ran into an
old friend yesterday.

57:48.599 --> 57:50.766
- You have friends?

57:50.768 --> 57:53.001
- You are really
someone to talk.

57:54.672 --> 57:57.840
- Whatever.

57:57.842 --> 58:01.944
- Anyway, so he's a teacher
and he was saying that

58:01.946 --> 58:05.981
apparently his
school's hiring subs

58:05.983 --> 58:12.054
and that maybe I should
send in my resume.

58:12.056 --> 58:14.623
- Why?

58:14.625 --> 58:19.595
- To apply for a job.

58:19.597 --> 58:23.098
- Do you want to teach?

58:23.100 --> 58:26.068
- I don't know, maybe.

58:26.070 --> 58:28.971
And who knows?

58:28.973 --> 58:31.974
If it goes well, it could lead
to something more permanent.

58:38.214 --> 58:40.182
- Okay.

58:40.184 --> 58:42.718
- What?

58:42.720 --> 58:47.122
I mean, it's at least
worth considering, right?

58:47.124 --> 58:50.726
- I don't know.

58:50.728 --> 58:57.132
Teaching sounds pretty fucking
miserable, if you ask me.

58:57.134 --> 58:59.034
But whatever.

58:59.036 --> 59:00.035
Sure.

59:31.768 --> 59:35.771
Okay, what?

59:35.773 --> 59:37.773
- Nothing.

59:37.775 --> 59:39.708
- Nothing?

59:39.710 --> 59:45.581
Really?

59:45.583 --> 59:50.252
- Why are you so damn
negative all the time?

59:50.254 --> 59:51.620
- I'm not negative.

59:51.622 --> 59:54.056
- Yeah, you are.

59:54.058 --> 59:56.725
I mean, you never have anything
good to say about anything

59:56.727 --> 59:59.962
and you know what, it
gets old after a while.

59:59.964 --> 01:00:01.263
- Oh yeah?

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:03.332
Well, if you don't
like my negativity,

01:00:03.334 --> 01:00:09.871
maybe we should spend a
little less time together.

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:15.077
- Are you serious?

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:17.079
You know what, fuck you.

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.728
- So the walrus
said to the waiter,

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:35.731
"hey wait a second,
that's my wife".

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:43.005
Hello?

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:44.206
- Huh?

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:47.743
Oh yeah, sorry.

01:00:47.745 --> 01:00:49.144
- Are you okay, man?

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:51.146
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good, good.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.064
Hey.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:22.237
- Hey.

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:26.908
Did you want something?

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:33.215
- No, not really.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:36.218
Look, about yesterday I'm
sorry if I was a jerk.

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:48.897
Alright, you know what, fine.

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:51.233
Forget it.

01:02:51.235 --> 01:02:53.969
What is wrong with you?

01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:56.104
I like spending time with you

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:58.507
and I really wanna
be your friend,

01:02:58.509 --> 01:03:03.211
so why do you make
it so damn hard?

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:06.515
- Are you done?

01:03:06.517 --> 01:03:11.119
- Maybe.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:14.089
- Good.

01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:19.161
Did you drive here?

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:20.295
- Yeah, why?

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:42.951
So, are you looking for a dog?

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:56.565
This guy's kinda cute.

01:03:56.567 --> 01:04:00.435
Or this one.

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:06.374
Are you looking for like
a certain kind of dog or--

01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:08.877
Daisy?

01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:16.184
Hey, what's up?

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:17.319
What's wrong?

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:34.369
Hey.

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:38.607
How can I help?

01:04:38.609 --> 01:04:43.545
It's okay.

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:45.080
It's okay.

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.095
You're not hungry?

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:14.376
You're sure you're okay?

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:18.079
- Yeah.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:20.048
I just--

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.550
I don't know.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:25.921
- Hey.

01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:32.360
You'll save the next one.

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:33.695
- You're not helping.

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:45.440
- So.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:49.511
I read your book.

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:51.980
- Oh, really?

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:59.087
- Yeah.

01:05:59.089 --> 01:06:05.460
Are you not gonna
ask if I liked it?

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:08.630
- No.

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:11.399
- Well, I did.

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:16.438
A lot actually.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.139
- Whatever.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.240
- Don't.

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:21.409
Don't do that.

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:22.510
- Do what?

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:25.480
- Act like that.

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:27.482
- Okay, you liked it so--

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.250
- that's not even what
I'm talking about.

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:29.250
- Oh, I had no idea--

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:32.187
- look, for once, can you please

01:06:32.189 --> 01:06:35.991
just not act like
nothing matters to you?

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:41.596
Huh?

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:46.334
- You're really annoying.

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:13.595
- So I guess I'll see you soon.

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:15.130
- Maybe, we'll see.

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:27.575
Hey.

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:28.576
Thanks.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:47.395
- So, how do you know Jack?

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.330
- We used to work together.

01:07:49.332 --> 01:07:52.534
- Well, he speaks
very highly of you.

01:07:52.536 --> 01:07:56.604
Look, right now we're
only hiring subs

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:58.606
so even if things do work out,

01:07:58.608 --> 01:08:00.175
I can't guarantee
you a set schedule.

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:02.744
Are you okay with that?

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.746
- Yeah, no.

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:06.648
I'm totally fine with that.

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:08.550
- Okay, let's see
what we have here.

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:14.622
Let me look at your resume.

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:16.691
So, no teaching experience?

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:19.594
- No, not yet.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:22.596
- Well, we all have to
start somewhere, right?

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.438
- Is something wrong?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.374
- You don't have your degree?

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:37.377
- I have my associate's degree.

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:42.317
Actually I was a few courses
shy of getting my bachelor's.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.219
- Damn.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.754
See, that's gonna be a problem.

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:52.861
Even for subs, we still
require a bachelor's degree.

01:08:52.863 --> 01:08:55.596
- Yeah.

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:58.299
I should have thought of that.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:01.402
- Look, you seem like good guy,

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:03.404
so why don't you
come back and see me

01:09:03.406 --> 01:09:10.145
when you finish that degree?

01:09:10.147 --> 01:09:12.447
- Okay.

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:17.618
Thank you.

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:37.498
- Hey.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:38.499
- Hey.

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:49.677
- What are you doing?

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:50.678
- Nothing.

01:10:58.287 --> 01:11:01.389
- Were you sitting in the dark?

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:02.390
- No.

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:16.271
- Are you feeling okay?

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:17.605
- Yeah, just fine.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:35.890
- Have you eaten?

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:38.393
Okay, do you want to

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:44.399
go out and grab and
something to eat?

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.634
- Yeah.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:49.470
Sure.

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:56.411
- Hey, are you sure you're okay?

01:11:56.413 --> 01:11:59.814
Cooper?

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:04.919
What are you doing?

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:06.054
Are you serious?

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:49.030
- Hey.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:50.565
Are you okay?

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:09.150
Daisy.

01:13:09.152 --> 01:13:10.985
Hey.

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:11.886
Daisy!

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:14.756
- What, what do you want?

01:13:14.758 --> 01:13:18.025
- Where are you going, why
are you acting like this?

01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:20.528
- Why.

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.697
Because I told you.

01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:28.936
I told you that's
not what I wanted.

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:34.075
So why?

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:36.844
Why did you do that?

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:40.681
- I just--

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:46.988
why didn't you just say no?

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:51.025
- You're such a fucking asshole.

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:58.166
- Daisy.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:07.575
- That's really good.

01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:11.612
Explain to me, when did people
get so damned frightened.

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:13.981
Everybody getting
plucked and tweezed

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:16.717
and waxed and scrubbed
between the legs.

01:14:16.719 --> 01:14:18.085
Growing up they couldn't wait

01:14:18.087 --> 01:14:19.921
to get a little
hair on their body.

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:22.757
Now everybody's looking
like an 11 year-old boy.

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:23.891
- So, how is everything?

01:14:23.893 --> 01:14:24.959
So, how is everything?

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.494
How is everything?

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:26.954
- Daisy, I can hear you.

01:15:26.956 --> 01:15:32.627
Will you just open the door?

01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:36.631
Look, I'm really sorry.

01:15:36.633 --> 01:15:41.802
Okay?

01:15:41.804 --> 01:15:46.173
Come on Daisy, just
open the damn door.

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:47.174
Please!

01:15:57.653 --> 01:16:00.922
Fuck you.

01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:04.592
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

01:16:04.594 --> 01:16:05.927
Fuck you.

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:34.589
- How's everything going?

01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:40.728
So, how's everything?

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:42.630
So, how is everything.

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:44.332
- For the life of me,
i couldn't figure out

01:16:44.334 --> 01:16:46.133
why anybody would
be worried about

01:16:46.135 --> 01:16:48.936
how their burial wig is
gonna be cut in the back.

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:50.705
So anyway--

01:16:50.707 --> 01:16:52.039
- so, how is everything?

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:11.359
- Fuck!

01:17:20.836 --> 01:17:21.936
- Coop.

01:17:21.938 --> 01:17:21.936
- Yeah.

01:17:21.938 --> 01:17:23.904
- What are you doing out here?

01:17:23.906 --> 01:17:29.910
- Nothing, I'm just
taking a break.

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:31.045
- Are you okay?

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:42.089
- What the fuck am i
doing with my life?

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:51.699
- You know something,

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:55.770
you and I have known each
other for a very long time.

01:17:55.772 --> 01:17:59.240
Right?

01:17:59.242 --> 01:18:04.278
And I feel like i
barely know you.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.846
I don't know, if you ask me

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:07.848
I just think that's really sad.

01:19:32.902 --> 01:19:35.903
- Holy fucking shit.

01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:36.904
- Hey.

01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:37.938
- Hey.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:38.906
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:19:38.908 --> 01:19:40.274
You scared the shit out of me.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:41.876
- Sorry.

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:44.044
- Yeah, well?

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:46.380
What do you want?

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:49.083
- Can we talk?

01:19:49.085 --> 01:19:52.052
- Sure we can talk but if
it's about your schedule

01:19:52.054 --> 01:19:53.954
then you can fuck off
because I'm not changing it--

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:55.422
- it's not about my schedule.

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:58.225
- Yeah, well, what do you want?

01:19:58.227 --> 01:19:59.994
- Look.

01:19:59.996 --> 01:20:03.264
- You're gay?

01:20:03.266 --> 01:20:04.932
I knew it.

01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:10.271
- I'm not gay, nope.

01:20:10.273 --> 01:20:13.174
I can't do this anymore.

01:20:13.176 --> 01:20:16.010
- Do what?

01:20:16.012 --> 01:20:20.314
- This.

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:24.018
I can't work here anymore.

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.419
- You're quitting?

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:28.489
- Yeah.

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:33.594
Sorry.

01:20:33.596 --> 01:20:35.129
- What?

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:36.330
You're quitting.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:37.832
So?

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:39.567
You want a fucking
parade or something?

01:20:39.569 --> 01:20:41.335
- No, it's just--

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:46.207
I worked here a long time.

01:20:46.209 --> 01:20:50.044
- Yeah, well.

01:20:50.046 --> 01:20:55.182
Shit happens.

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:57.051
Fucking white people.

01:20:57.053 --> 01:21:01.055
Always have to be so
dramatic about everything.

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:21.475
- You can't just keep
showing up like this.

01:21:21.477 --> 01:21:25.012
- I know.

01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:32.019
- Okay, well, I'm just leaving.

01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:34.321
What?

01:21:34.323 --> 01:21:42.029
What do you want from me?

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:45.432
- I'm really sorry.

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:50.004
I really am and if it
is at all possible,

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:54.642
I would still like
to be your friend.

01:21:54.644 --> 01:21:59.046
- I'm not sure it is.

01:21:59.048 --> 01:22:01.048
- Can't we at least just try?

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:12.693
What the hell are
you so afraid of?

01:22:12.695 --> 01:22:15.229
- I'm not afraid of anything.

01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:17.464
- That is bullshit.

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:19.400
Because you are
just as afraid as me

01:22:19.402 --> 01:22:27.441
only you're too
chickenshit to admit it.

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:29.209
Want me to go first?

01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:33.147
Fine.

01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:36.617
I have no idea what I want to
do with the rest of my life

01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:41.555
and it scares the
shit out of me.

01:22:41.557 --> 01:22:43.424
What else?

01:22:43.426 --> 01:22:48.162
I'm afraid of getting old,

01:22:48.164 --> 01:22:51.598
of being alone.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.269
And I'm really afraid
that you won't forgive me.

01:22:55.271 --> 01:23:02.509
So basically I'm just
scared to fucking death.

01:23:02.511 --> 01:23:06.613
So I'm begging you,

01:23:06.615 --> 01:23:11.452
please can we just
give it one more try?

01:23:11.454 --> 01:23:14.588
Because I would really,
really like to be your friend.

01:23:21.029 --> 01:23:23.097
- You're such an asshole.

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:47.454
- Hey there, big guy.

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:49.289
- Well, hello there.

01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:53.227
- Oh, hey.

01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:55.229
- How you're feeling?

01:23:55.231 --> 01:23:57.231
- Good.

01:23:57.233 --> 01:23:58.766
- That's good.

01:23:58.768 --> 01:24:01.769
Well, if you two need
anything just let me know.

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:11.211
- Actually I'm--

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:13.480
can I meet him?

01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:18.786
- Well, yeah you can.

01:24:18.788 --> 01:24:25.059
He's a good boy too.

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:28.328
- Come on, here, here.

01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:29.329
Ready, ready?

01:24:29.331 --> 01:24:30.431
Here, Cooper.

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:52.586
Yes.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:54.688
- So what do you think?

01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:56.690
- I like him.

01:24:56.692 --> 01:24:58.525
He's old.

01:24:58.527 --> 01:25:00.861
Kinda like you.
