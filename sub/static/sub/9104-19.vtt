00:32.640 --> 00:34.760
<i>&lrm;we're able to have</i>
<i>&lrm;our work experience day</i>

00:34.880 --> 00:38.000
<i>&lrm;at the Grand Paris Luxury Hotel.</i>

00:38.120 --> 00:42.320
&lrm;You will all get hands-on experience
&lrm;with a job at the hotel.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.320
&lrm;[giggling]

00:44.480 --> 00:47.000
&lrm;[she sighs]
&lrm;You'll be graded on your effort

00:47.160 --> 00:49.920
&lrm;which will affect
&lrm;whether you pass or fail.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.080
&lrm;[Adrien gasps awkwardly]

00:53.680 --> 00:56.160
&lrm;Do you have Marinette
&lrm;and Alya on your list?

00:56.320 --> 00:57.600
&lrm;Doesn't look like it.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.240
&lrm;I bet I know who helped daddy

01:00.360 --> 01:01.960
&lrm;make the assignments.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.879
&lrm;She gets to spend
&lrm;an entire day with Adrien.

01:05.040 --> 01:08.200
&lrm;This is gonna be
&lrm;the worst... day... ever.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.200
&lrm;There must be an oversight.

01:10.360 --> 01:11.360
&lrm;[Chloe]
&lrm;Daddy!

01:13.400 --> 01:14.720
&lrm;Thank you, sweetie.

01:14.880 --> 01:19.280
&lrm;Yes, Alya, you'll be...
&lrm;sorting trash at the dumpster.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.000
&lrm;And Marinette,

01:30.120 --> 01:31.160
&lrm;Hey, that's...

01:32.960 --> 01:35.760
&lrm;Excuse me, this is a luxury hotel,

01:35.920 --> 01:37.360
&lrm;[Fang snarls]
&lrm;not a zoo.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.440
&lrm;Daddy!

01:38.880 --> 01:41.000
&lrm;That's Jagged Stone,
&lrm;the rock star.

01:41.160 --> 01:45.360
&lrm;He's sold millions of albums,
&lrm;he's very famous and he's very rich.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.440
&lrm;Mr. Stone,
&lrm;welcome to the Grand Paris Hotel.

01:48.560 --> 01:51.880
&lrm;I am Major Bourgeois,
&lrm;owner of this establishment,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.120
&lrm;the most luxurious in all of Paris.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.320
&lrm;How might we serve you?

01:55.720 --> 01:56.680
&lrm;How d'you think?

01:56.840 --> 01:58.880
&lrm;I'm not here to admire your lobby.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.480
&lrm;Jagged wants
&lrm;your most luxurious suite.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.680
&lrm;Fang better get a real bathtub,

02:03.840 --> 02:06.920
&lrm;not a tiny water hole
&lrm;like the hotel across the street.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.520
&lrm;We have everything you need,
&lrm;Mrs. Fang,

02:09.680 --> 02:11.920
&lrm;even a state-of-the-art
&lrm;fitness centre.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.320
&lrm;Fang is my crocodile.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.480
&lrm;[Fang pants]

&lrm;Mr. Stone, we have all you require

&lrm;[stammering]
&lrm;for your... F-Fang.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.480
&lrm;Would he... enjoy a bubble bath?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.840
&lrm;Crocodiles don't like bubble baths,

02:24.960 --> 02:26.400
&lrm;it dries their scales out.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.680
&lrm;No, not him again.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.680
&lrm;Remember me, Mr. Stone?
&lrm;Vincent Asa.

02:45.840 --> 02:48.600
&lrm;Just one photo
&lrm;to show everyone we're best buds.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.560
&lrm;Please, I'm your biggest fan.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.400
&lrm;I know. You've been
&lrm;to my last 36 shows

02:53.560 --> 02:55.080
&lrm;but we are not friends.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.360
&lrm;There, look into the lens.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.880
&lrm;[camera clicks]

02:59.520 --> 03:01.840
&lrm;Didn't you hear him?
&lrm;You still haven't got it, have you?

03:02.600 --> 03:03.600
&lrm;No... photos!

03:03.760 --> 03:04.720
&lrm;[groaning]

03:06.680 --> 03:07.680
&lrm;Good reflexes.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.360
&lrm;Don't let me see you
&lrm;near Mr. Stone again.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.200
&lrm;Next time you won't get
&lrm;your camera back.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.240
&lrm;[angry sigh]

03:17.240 --> 03:19.920
&lrm;I sense brewing anger
&lrm;and frustration...

03:20.240 --> 03:23.120
&lrm;perfect fodder
&lrm;for my evil little Akumas.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.080
&lrm;It won't be long, now.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.800
&lrm;[mysterious music]

03:31.440 --> 03:34.360
&lrm;Fly away, my little Akuma,
&lrm;and evilise him!

03:34.480 --> 03:36.640
&lrm;[dramatic music]

03:46.000 --> 03:48.840
&lrm;Pixelator, I am Hawk Moth.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
&lrm;I'm giving you the power to capture
&lrm;your hero's smile, forever,

03:53.160 --> 03:57.200
&lrm;but in return, you'll need to do
&lrm;some capturing for me as well.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.480
&lrm;Yes, Hawk Moth.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.720
&lrm;Yes, yes.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.160
&lrm;[exhausted sigh]

04:04.280 --> 04:07.880
&lrm;Mr. Bourgeois, you haven't told Marinette
&lrm;what she'll be doing.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.840
&lrm;Yes, of course, Marinette...

04:11.000 --> 04:13.360
&lrm;Gofer...
&lrm;I've got a job for you already.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.240
&lrm;Gofer, what's that?

04:15.400 --> 04:18.519
&lrm;I'm guessing
&lrm;it's as bad as trash duty.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.600
&lrm;Mr. Stone needs a new pair
&lrm;of shades for tonight's gig.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.400
&lrm;Red, white and blue,
&lrm;with two Eiffel Towers.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.080
&lrm;-Can you get that?
&lrm;-Of course we can.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.000
&lrm;Marinette is our gofer,
&lrm;she'll take care of it.

04:33.160 --> 04:33.960
&lrm;[she gasps]

04:34.120 --> 04:37.320
&lrm;It's an employee who "goes for"
&lrm;anything a customer needs,

04:37.480 --> 04:38.520
&lrm;anything at all!

04:38.680 --> 04:39.480
&lrm;So go ahead,

04:39.800 --> 04:40.720
&lrm;go for it.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.960
&lrm;[nervous giggle]

04:49.720 --> 04:50.720
&lrm;These should do.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.200
&lrm;Now I can get back
&lrm;and hang with Adrien.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.160
&lrm;[groaning]
&lrm;And Chloe.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.240
&lrm;These aren't even close
&lrm;to what Mr. Stone wants.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.400
&lrm;What do you mean?

04:59.560 --> 05:02.000
&lrm;There's some red and white,
&lrm;and 2 Eiffel towers.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.680
&lrm;I'm just saying it's better
&lrm;to do it right the first time.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.680
&lrm;[gasping]

05:09.760 --> 05:11.200
&lrm;Meow.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.400
&lrm;-Where are the Eiffel Towers?
&lrm;-Here.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.800
&lrm;This is a joke, right?
&lrm;Are you trying to ruin my career?

05:19.920 --> 05:23.120
&lrm;But Mr. Stone,
&lrm;the glasses you want don't exist.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.120
&lrm;Do I look like I care?

05:25.520 --> 05:27.240
&lrm;Just get me those sunglasses!

05:27.840 --> 05:29.280
&lrm;[she sighs]
&lrm;Great.

05:29.760 --> 05:33.000
&lrm;Now I'll have to spend
&lrm;even more time away from Adrien.

05:33.160 --> 05:36.960
&lrm;That's what I tried telling you,
&lrm;just do it right the first time.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.600
&lrm;Yeah, you're right Tikki.
&lrm;I get it now.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.920
&lrm;Those sunglasses exist somewhere,
&lrm;get creative.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.880
&lrm;[gasping]
&lrm;Of course.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.280
&lrm;Failed as a gofer already?
&lrm;Not surprised.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.160
&lrm;Don't let the door hit you
&lrm;on the way out.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.480
&lrm;Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

06:01.880 --> 06:03.440
&lrm;Look into the lens.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.400
&lrm;Photo finished.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.640
&lrm;[cackling]

06:13.920 --> 06:16.080
&lrm;Look what the cat dragged in.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.000
&lrm;Let me handle this, Adrien.
&lrm;Watch and learn.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.520
&lrm;Excuse me!
&lrm;You can't be a guest at this hotel.

06:22.680 --> 06:26.200
&lrm;My father only allows in
&lrm;important celebrities, like me.

06:26.680 --> 06:30.320
&lrm;Well, then, I'm Pixelator,
&lrm;your number one fan.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.800
<i>&lrm;Moi</i>&lrm;? You're flattering me.

06:33.920 --> 06:34.880
&lrm;Keep going.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.640
&lrm;A photo of you, sweet Miss?

06:37.760 --> 06:39.720
&lrm;Chloe, of course.

06:40.000 --> 06:40.840
&lrm;Look out!

06:40.960 --> 06:42.720
&lrm;Look into the lens, Miss.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.920
&lrm;-What the...?
&lrm;-What just happened?

06:49.080 --> 06:51.360
&lrm;I think we've been like... digitised.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.560
&lrm;What do you mean digitised?

06:53.680 --> 06:56.120
&lrm;I don't know
&lrm;but I don't think it's good.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.520
&lrm;Well, I can fix this.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.120
&lrm;Leave it to me.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.560
&lrm;Daddy?

07:03.400 --> 07:05.080
&lrm;Daddy?

07:05.680 --> 07:06.920
&lrm;Daddy!

07:09.320 --> 07:11.440
&lrm;[Marinette]
<i>&lrm;Where did I put them?</i>

07:11.880 --> 07:12.720
&lrm;Voila!

07:13.960 --> 07:15.360
&lrm;But they're pink.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.960
&lrm;They won't be after.

07:17.080 --> 07:20.640
&lrm;These will be the most amazing
&lrm;or the ugliest pair of shades

07:20.760 --> 07:22.040
&lrm;in shades' history.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.640
&lrm;Mrs. Bustier is grading me
&lrm;on effort, right?

07:24.760 --> 07:27.960
&lrm;Don't worry,
&lrm;I'm sure Jagged will love them.

07:29.720 --> 07:30.560
&lrm;Or hate them.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.960
&lrm;[Chloe huffs]
&lrm;I still can't get through.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.640
&lrm;How can there be no reception?

07:38.760 --> 07:40.400
&lrm;[phone bleeps]
&lrm;Ridiculous!

07:40.560 --> 07:43.520
&lrm;It just goes on forever.
&lrm;No door, no walls, nothing.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.640
&lrm;You mean we're stuck here
&lrm;Just...

07:46.680 --> 07:48.240
&lrm;Just us two?

07:48.400 --> 07:50.720
&lrm;No, there's gotta be a way out.

07:50.840 --> 07:51.800
&lrm;[Chloe sighs]

07:51.920 --> 07:53.280
&lrm;I hope.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.480
&lrm;[panting]

07:57.240 --> 07:59.200
&lrm;Adrien? Chloe?

07:59.520 --> 08:02.440
&lrm;[she groans]
&lrm;I bet they've gone somewhere fun.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.880
&lrm;And now I'm here all alone
&lrm;without Adrien.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.160
&lrm;Snap out of it.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.440
&lrm;Let's just focus on getting
&lrm;Mr. Stone his glasses, OK?

08:18.640 --> 08:20.440
&lrm;-Jagged Stone?
&lrm;-What?

08:21.920 --> 08:23.400
&lrm;Look into the lens.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.400
&lrm;I'll get them to Mr. Stone.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.520
&lrm;Can't you deliver them now?

08:27.640 --> 08:29.720
&lrm;He's... resting.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.600
&lrm;Who likes having
&lrm;his belly scratched?

08:32.760 --> 08:34.679
&lrm;Daddy's little Fang?

08:35.240 --> 08:36.320
&lrm;OK, no problem,

08:36.480 --> 08:38.559
&lrm;Just trying to do
&lrm;the job right this time.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.679
&lrm;-Got it.
&lrm;-Thank... you.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.120
&lrm;I hope Mr. Stone likes them.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.240
&lrm;Hard work always pays off.

08:53.480 --> 08:54.480
&lrm;Who are you?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.880
&lrm;Look into the lens.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.080
&lrm;Time to transform.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.080
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

09:19.240 --> 09:21.240
&lrm;[panting]

09:21.640 --> 09:24.000
&lrm;Hey there,
&lrm;time for your photo shoot.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.800
&lrm;How did you get in here?
&lrm;What photo shoot?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.400
&lrm;Fang, attack!

09:28.560 --> 09:31.080
&lrm;[panting]

09:31.760 --> 09:33.440
&lrm;See you later, alligator.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.320
&lrm;What? Fang? Fang!

09:38.000 --> 09:39.080
&lrm;Who are you?

09:39.200 --> 09:42.240
&lrm;I'm Pixelator,
&lrm;your biggest fan, Mr. Stone.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.360
&lrm;Can I call you Jagged?

09:43.480 --> 09:46.400
&lrm;-No!
&lrm;-I want to immortalize you, Jagged.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.840
&lrm;I'll be your one and only fan.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.800
&lrm;You will belong to me for eternity.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.200
&lrm;Now, look into the lens.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.680
&lrm;So you're Ladybug.
&lrm;I've heard such pathetic

09:59.800 --> 10:01.240
&lrm;things about you.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.920
&lrm;Look into the lens.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.400
&lrm;[he groans]

10:34.040 --> 10:35.920
&lrm;[she gasps]

10:39.280 --> 10:41.720
&lrm;[Jagged Stone yells]

10:43.440 --> 10:45.360
&lrm;[angry groan]
&lrm;Where did they go?

10:45.760 --> 10:48.720
&lrm;If you want Jagged,
&lrm;you must find Ladybug.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.600
&lrm;I don't have time
&lrm;to deal with this Ladybug.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.760
&lrm;Yes you do.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.800
&lrm;[Hawk Moth]
<i>&lrm;Plenty of time!</i>

10:54.960 --> 10:56.040
&lrm;OK, OK.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.240
&lrm;[Pixelator]
<i>&lrm;Tell me what to do.</i>

10:57.360 --> 10:59.400
&lrm;[Hawk Moth]
<i>&lrm;I demand an excellent photo</i>

10:59.520 --> 11:01.320
&lrm;of Ladybug with her Miraculous.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.640
&lrm;[Hawk Moth]
<i>&lrm;I want those powers!</i>

11:03.800 --> 11:06.080
<i>&lrm;So listen very carefully.</i>

11:06.200 --> 11:08.280
&lrm;I can't stay here, I'm performing.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.240
&lrm;You'll get to do your gig.
&lrm;You'll even wear awesome shades.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.360
&lrm;[She chuckles]

11:15.520 --> 11:17.680
&lrm;While I catch Pixelator, stay here.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.840
&lrm;No-one would think to look here.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.880
&lrm;Ladybug, is this safe?

11:22.040 --> 11:23.360
&lrm;This is a school.

11:24.040 --> 11:28.160
&lrm;Yes, Pixelator would never imagine
&lrm;his idol would hang out at school.

11:29.560 --> 11:32.440
&lrm;I mean... isn't school awesome?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.960
&lrm;This is ridiculous.
&lrm;I don't have time for this.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.680
&lrm;First, I get hijacked
&lrm;by this crazed fan,

11:37.840 --> 11:39.840
&lrm;then, I'm attacked
&lrm;by a super-weirdo...

11:39.960 --> 11:43.240
&lrm;Wait, what do you know
&lrm;about this crazed fan?

11:43.400 --> 11:45.960
&lrm;He's come to every one
&lrm;of my shows this year.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.160
&lrm;He's sent me stacks of letters,
&lrm;gone through my trash,

11:49.320 --> 11:52.520
&lrm;he even followed my mother
&lrm;to her weekly bingo night.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.360
&lrm;-How creepy.
&lrm;-Not really.

11:54.520 --> 11:57.160
&lrm;It's just a bunch
&lrm;of elderly ladies having fun.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.400
&lrm;[She groans]

12:02.560 --> 12:04.960
&lrm;Vincent... Asa.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.120
&lrm;Got his address.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.240
&lrm;You're not leaving me here, are you?

12:09.920 --> 12:12.640
&lrm;I mean...
&lrm;isn't... school awesome?

12:12.920 --> 12:15.080
&lrm;Daddy! Daddy!

12:15.920 --> 12:18.440
&lrm;Plagg, I've gotta find
&lrm;some way to transform.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.040
&lrm;Come on, what's the rush?

12:21.160 --> 12:22.000
&lrm;[Angry sigh]

12:23.200 --> 12:26.760
&lrm;Fine, if you insist.
&lrm;At least find me some cheese.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.840
&lrm;I'm gonna see
&lrm;if there's a way out.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.840
&lrm;Don't go anywhere,
&lrm;could be dangerous.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.040
&lrm;Dangerous?

12:32.440 --> 12:33.640
&lrm;Not scared, are you?

12:33.760 --> 12:37.040
&lrm;Scared? <i>&lrm;Moi</i>&lrm;? As if. No way.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.440
&lrm;[He chuckles]

12:39.800 --> 12:42.240
&lrm;[Screeching]

12:49.920 --> 12:52.920
&lrm;The Champs-Elysées... perfect.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.960
&lrm;May the photo shoot begin.

13:06.880 --> 13:07.720
&lrm;Amateur.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.320
&lrm;This isn't creepy at all.

13:20.120 --> 13:20.800
&lrm;What?

13:23.840 --> 13:25.480
&lrm;[Chloe screams]

13:25.800 --> 13:27.040
&lrm;Ladybug?

13:27.520 --> 13:29.800
&lrm;What are you two doing in there?

13:29.920 --> 13:33.640
&lrm;Ladybug, remember me?
&lrm;Your biggest fan.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.720
&lrm;Please get us out of here.
&lrm;It's terrible in here.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.240
&lrm;I mean...
&lrm;only when you're not around.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.440
&lrm;[Man]
&lrm;Over here, Ladybug.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.680
&lrm;[Woman]
&lrm;Help, Ladybug.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.000
&lrm;Help!

13:46.160 --> 13:47.120
&lrm;What happened?

13:47.560 --> 13:50.760
&lrm;It's terrible.
&lrm;This man, he... took a photo of us

13:50.920 --> 13:52.800
&lrm;and we ended up trapped in here.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.680
&lrm;While innocently strolling
&lrm;the Champs-Elysées.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.800
&lrm;I sure hope
&lrm;Cat Noir's there already.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.320
&lrm;Excuse me, sir. Sir?

14:09.600 --> 14:12.600
&lrm;Care for an interview
&lrm;to spread the villain's voice?

14:14.440 --> 14:16.880
&lrm;[Pixelator]
<i>&lrm;I will continue my photo shoot</i>

14:17.000 --> 14:18.680
<i>&lrm;until Jagged Stone turns up.</i>

14:18.800 --> 14:22.640
<i>&lrm;Where are you Jagged?</i>
<i>&lrm;Your biggest fan awaits.</i>

14:22.800 --> 14:25.320
<i>&lrm;All I want is one photo.</i>

14:25.480 --> 14:29.960
<i>&lrm;Otherwise, soon the people of Paris</i>
<i>&lrm;will be nothing but memories.</i>

14:32.080 --> 14:33.720
&lrm;[he cackles]

14:35.480 --> 14:36.560
&lrm;This is terrible.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.880
&lrm;I've gotta do what Pixelator says.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.920
&lrm;Surely you can't be serious?
&lrm;It's dangerous out there.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.200
&lrm;Who cares?

14:44.360 --> 14:47.000
&lrm;Jagged Stone can't turn down
&lrm;a TV appearance.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.840
&lrm;Imagine what it would do
&lrm;for my career?

14:59.040 --> 15:01.760
&lrm;Got an itchy trigger finger, eh?

15:04.160 --> 15:06.280
&lrm;[together]
&lrm;Yeah!

15:06.400 --> 15:08.480
&lrm;Yeah!

15:08.600 --> 15:10.480
&lrm;I was expecting you, Ladybug.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.440
&lrm;Look into the lens.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.320
&lrm;[He chuckles]

15:34.600 --> 15:36.080
&lrm;I have a proposition to make.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.720
&lrm;If you free those innocent people,

15:39.880 --> 15:43.040
&lrm;I'll organise a photo shoot
&lrm;with Jagged Stone.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.560
&lrm;No! Don't listen to her.
&lrm;She's trying to trick you.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.560
&lrm;Why should I believe you?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.200
&lrm;You have no choice.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.480
&lrm;I'm the only one
&lrm;who knows where Jagged is.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.360
&lrm;How about I free half now

15:55.520 --> 15:58.000
&lrm;and the rest
&lrm;after the photo shoot? Deal?

15:58.160 --> 15:59.080
&lrm;OK, deal.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.760
&lrm;[Under her breath]
&lrm;Yeah, right.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.360
&lrm;[Nino gasps]
&lrm;Dude!

16:12.480 --> 16:14.000
&lrm;[Nino]
&lrm;You scared me.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.320
&lrm;Fill in for me, will you?

16:16.480 --> 16:18.600
&lrm;What do you think
&lrm;I have been doing?

16:24.840 --> 16:28.080
&lrm;I think someone's been akumatised.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.320
&lrm;The question is,
&lrm;where's the Akuma?

16:30.440 --> 16:32.640
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

16:47.080 --> 16:50.040
&lrm;I kept my part of the deal,
&lrm;now bring me Jagged!

16:51.680 --> 16:54.200
&lrm;Pixelator, I know your Akuma's

16:54.360 --> 16:55.640
&lrm;inside your glasses!

16:56.120 --> 16:57.720
&lrm;Stop wasting time.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.040
&lrm;[Bystander]
&lrm;Yeah, go, Cat Noir!

17:09.319 --> 17:10.960
&lrm;Thanks for dropping in.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.800
&lrm;Not very handy, I see.

17:13.920 --> 17:14.960
&lrm;What about our deal?

17:15.079 --> 17:17.040
<i>&lrm;I told you she'd betray you.</i>

17:17.400 --> 17:19.920
&lrm;Capture them!
&lrm;I want their Miraculous!

17:23.480 --> 17:24.800
&lrm;Together!

17:30.200 --> 17:31.440
&lrm;[he yells]

17:31.840 --> 17:33.880
&lrm;No, not again.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.120
&lrm;When the cat's away,
&lrm;the mice will play.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.920
&lrm;Ready to become immortalised?

17:39.520 --> 17:41.000
&lrm;Can't wait to live it up.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.720
&lrm;Look into the lens.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.720
&lrm;Hey, Pixelator,
&lrm;I heard you wanted my photo.

17:59.760 --> 18:00.880
&lrm;[Pixelator]
&lrm;Jagged?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.320
&lrm;It's about time you showed up.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.120
&lrm;Get out of here, Mr. Stone!

18:09.160 --> 18:11.600
&lrm;It's me you wanted
&lrm;all this time, right?

18:11.760 --> 18:14.200
&lrm;Well, here I am, in the flesh.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.360
&lrm;Look into the lens.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.800
&lrm;Wait, wrong side.
&lrm;This isn't my best angle.

18:19.960 --> 18:23.480
&lrm;No, wait, the lightings wrong.
&lrm;Does my nose look big?

18:23.640 --> 18:25.000
&lrm;This is better.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.800
&lrm;Hurry up, already!

18:28.160 --> 18:29.600
&lrm;Lucky charm!

18:34.920 --> 18:37.600
&lrm;[Gasping]
&lrm;A powder compact?

18:38.240 --> 18:40.000
&lrm;-I think I'm ready.
&lrm;-Stop moving!

18:40.160 --> 18:41.120
&lrm;Look into the lens!

18:43.120 --> 18:44.520
&lrm;Don't do it, Mr. Stone!

18:45.720 --> 18:47.560
&lrm;Cataclysm!

18:59.160 --> 19:00.360
&lrm;Yes!

19:01.120 --> 19:02.280
&lrm;[Pixelator]
&lrm;Come on,

19:02.400 --> 19:03.920
&lrm;open your eyes.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.960
&lrm;Batter up!

19:24.360 --> 19:25.520
&lrm;What?

19:26.040 --> 19:28.360
&lrm;[Gasping]
&lrm;How did...

19:28.840 --> 19:31.520
&lrm;Next time, I assure you,
&lrm;it won't be a photo finish.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.800
&lrm;I won't stop Ladybug.
&lrm;I'll destroy you!

19:36.240 --> 19:38.040
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:50.160 --> 19:52.480
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.120
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

20:01.880 --> 20:02.560
&lrm;Gotcha!

20:03.920 --> 20:05.760
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.040
&lrm;[Gasping]
&lrm;What happened?

20:12.200 --> 20:13.320
&lrm;Where am I?

20:13.880 --> 20:14.960
&lrm;[together]
&lrm;Pound it!

20:17.200 --> 20:20.200
&lrm;Thank you for this
&lrm;work-experience day, Mr. Bourgeois.

20:20.360 --> 20:23.320
&lrm;I'm sure we'll all remember it
&lrm;for a long time.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.680
&lrm;So will I.

20:24.840 --> 20:27.000
&lrm;[Discreet coughing]
&lrm;I almost forgot.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.920
&lrm;Jagged Stone's giving
&lrm;a concert tonight.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.600
&lrm;I'm giving tickets to those
&lrm;who showed the most effort.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.560
&lrm;Ri... diculous! Utterly ridiculous!

20:43.080 --> 20:45.320
&lrm;Good evening, Paris!

20:47.600 --> 20:50.000
&lrm;It's my first live concert... ever.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.600
&lrm;It's amazing!

20:51.760 --> 20:53.000
&lrm;Yeah, amazing.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.440
&lrm;This song is for
&lrm;the girl who saved my life,

20:56.600 --> 20:58.280
&lrm;this one's for you, Ladybug.

21:01.640 --> 21:06.640
