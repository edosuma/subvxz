WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.783
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:03.212 --> 00:05.328
Liam, I've got a Beta.

00:05.548 --> 00:07.288
I think right now
I could use a training manual.

00:07.467 --> 00:10.379
I don't know why we're going after a Beta
when there's an Alpha on the field.

00:10.595 --> 00:12.677
Because an entire pack of Alphas
went after McCall

00:12.889 --> 00:14.629
and he was the one left standing.

00:14.807 --> 00:17.264
- Kate was here for this.
- That little pendant is training wheels.

00:17.435 --> 00:18.470
What are you gonna do
when you find her?

00:18.644 --> 00:19.804
Do what's necessary.

01:26.629 --> 01:29.416
eventually settling in a small town
in Northern California,

01:29.632 --> 01:32.965
this family used their wealth to rebuild
the community around them

01:33.177 --> 01:35.418
while remaining isolated from it.

01:35.638 --> 01:38.300
This was sometimes
more a choice than a necessity

01:38.516 --> 01:41.679
as not all of their children
would become werewolves.

01:41.894 --> 01:46.137
The ones that did,
these born wolves, had to be trained.

01:46.357 --> 01:48.348
They needed to learn control.

01:48.568 --> 01:50.775
They had a practice
for the training of Betas,

01:50.987 --> 01:53.148
a tradition passed down
through generations.

01:53.364 --> 01:57.528
It involved the use
of a sacred object called a Triskelion.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.484
Without control,

02:00.830 --> 02:02.240
violence,

02:02.456 --> 02:06.244
extreme violence is inevitable.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.545
Big fancy guns...

02:18.431 --> 02:19.841
Coded death lists...

02:21.058 --> 02:23.720
So-called assassins.

02:28.482 --> 02:32.646
And not one of you can answer
the simplest question.

02:36.741 --> 02:38.106
Who's paying the bills?

02:39.577 --> 02:41.488
So I'll ask again.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.364
Who is The Benefactor?

02:44.123 --> 02:47.786
I swear to God I've never seen him,
never spoken to him...

02:48.002 --> 02:50.209
I know.
See, everybody says the same thing.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.207
They don't know who he is.
Where he is.

02:52.423 --> 02:54.584
"It's all done electronically.
I can't help you.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.008
"Please, I'm bleeding to death.
Please stop, it hurts."

02:58.220 --> 02:59.801
Then what do you want with me?

03:00.765 --> 03:03.381
It's been a long time since
someone's made me a mix tape.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.556
You got one too, didn't you?

03:07.772 --> 03:08.761
No, no...

03:08.981 --> 03:10.812
But I... But I know who did.

03:11.192 --> 03:14.150
They look like kids.
Like teenagers.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.856
They're called The Orphans...

04:01.409 --> 04:02.740
Wait! Wait!

04:02.952 --> 04:05.989
I'll tell you about them.
I'll tell you everything. Just wait...

04:50.541 --> 04:53.078
Guys, back off.
You can get your gear tomorrow.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.535
If anybody sees Garrett,
you notify the police immediately.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.044
Then tell him he's off the damn team.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.338
Dad, really. I'm okay.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.546
I should've been here.
And I said I would be at the games.

05:03.763 --> 05:05.549
Well, I mean this was
just a pre-season scrimmage.

05:05.765 --> 05:08.381
- I didn't even tell you about it.
- But I promised your mom I'd be around

05:08.601 --> 05:11.513
so she could pick up some double shifts
at the hospital.

05:11.729 --> 05:12.809
I should've been here.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.141
You're here now.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.692
Jordan Parrish?

05:26.160 --> 05:27.491
Deputy Parrish.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.831
Sheriff, what is that?
Is that the weapon?

05:42.051 --> 05:44.713
Yeah. It's a thermo-cut wire.

05:48.766 --> 05:49.972
Parrish, hold up.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.433
- Where's Kira?
- She took off.

05:53.646 --> 05:57.355
Stiles told her about Lydia cracking
the second part of the dead pool.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.686
- Her mom's on it.
- Everyone's on it.

06:01.654 --> 06:02.814
- You're not.
- Not yet.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.315
There's still another third, right?

06:06.575 --> 06:10.784
Thermo-cut wire's
a very unusual weapon, Violet.

06:11.747 --> 06:15.160
Now, we've got a file
at the Bureau on something similar.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.662
Used in over a dozen murders.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.333
I don't know what you're talking about.
| just go to school here.

06:21.632 --> 06:23.793
Maybe we should
call your parents then.

06:24.009 --> 06:27.843
Oh, no. That's right.
You don't have any parents.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.009
That's why they call you
The Orphans.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.807
We need to find her boyfriend, Garrett.

06:40.484 --> 06:44.523
Coach, I'm gonna need
both their locker numbers.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.478
And someone find me
a set of bolt cutters.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.278
What the hell is happening to this kid?

06:50.494 --> 06:53.736
He's been poisoned by a rare wolfsbane.
I need to make an incision

06:53.914 --> 06:56.291
and you need to hold him
as still as possible.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.165
Hey, Derek,
how about a little werewolf strength?

06:59.587 --> 07:01.202
Yeah, I'm not the only one here
with werewolf strength.

07:01.463 --> 07:02.873
If you can't hold him still,

07:03.090 --> 07:05.001
the incision might kill him.

07:07.136 --> 07:09.843
I think he's slipping.
I don't think I can hold him.

07:30.159 --> 07:33.196
I guess I still have
a little werewolf strength myself.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.157
Yeah, maybe more than a little.

07:42.755 --> 07:45.041
Hey, Doc, I don't think he's breathing.

08:00.356 --> 08:01.562
Is he okay?

08:01.857 --> 08:04.815
I think he'll be fine,
but he'll probably be out for a while.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.531
Guys, can you hear that?
I think he's saying something.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.703
The sun... The moon...

08:19.750 --> 08:20.830
The truth...

08:21.543 --> 08:22.532
The sun...

08:22.753 --> 08:24.960
The moon... The truth...

08:27.466 --> 08:29.832
"Three things cannot long be hidden.

08:30.678 --> 08:31.963
"The sun,

08:32.179 --> 08:35.421
"the moon, and the truth."

08:36.934 --> 08:38.140
It's Buddhist.

08:46.986 --> 08:48.442
Satomi.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.588
I think someone's coming.

09:11.635 --> 09:12.715
Hurry.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.138
You find anything?

09:26.734 --> 09:27.689
No.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.225
Nothing.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.777
Yeah, I know that I'm a month late.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.696
Three months? Oh.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.534
Are you sure it's three months?

09:44.752 --> 09:45.867
Okay, I understand.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.702
Um, but it you could just
turn the power back on

09:48.922 --> 09:50.458
even for a few hours,

09:51.175 --> 09:52.631
that would be really great.

09:52.843 --> 09:55.084
I have a refrigerator full of food
that's going to go bad.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.669
And, obviously, I don't have the money

09:56.889 --> 09:59.926
to run out and replace
$300 worth of groceries. So...

10:01.685 --> 10:03.596
I am more than happy to beg.

10:16.909 --> 10:19.491
It's notjust
that we were friends with them.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.035
They were using us for their cover.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.163
I mean, professional killers
were using us.

10:25.375 --> 10:29.493
- How are you not freaking out about that?
- Trust me, I'm freaking out about a lot.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.629
Liam, slow down.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.089
Liam!

10:36.553 --> 10:37.963
Hey, Liam.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.573
Hey, Liam.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.285
Sorry about missing movie night.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.045
Don't worry.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.376
I got something else planned.

11:40.659 --> 11:43.696
Has anyone seen Stiles,
Lydia or Kira today?

11:44.413 --> 11:46.904
Malia.
Any idea where your friends are?

11:47.291 --> 11:49.532
I could try catching their scent.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.002
Right.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.793
How about I just mark
them down as absent.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.667
Malia.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.719
Okay, everyone,
let's begin with last night's homework.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.463
Malia.

12:16.028 --> 12:18.986
Malia.
Do you need to be excused from class?

12:19.781 --> 12:20.816
Yeah.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.247
- What are you doing here?
- Brett's still out of it.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.920
I need to find his pack
and warn them about the dead pool.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.876
So what do you need me for?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.132
I know a little something
about this pack.

12:45.349 --> 12:48.261
They have a kind of secret meeting place
in the woods.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.559
No one's spent more time in the woods
of Beacon Hills than you.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.181
This is Brett's.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.398
I'm not good at that yet.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.192
Try it. I'll teach you.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.275
Focus on the different scents.

13:03.492 --> 13:04.652
Some are tied to identity.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.369
Others give off an emotion.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.908
Your dad should be back
within the hour.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.873
You want to wait in his office?

13:17.089 --> 13:19.546
Actually, we want to talk to you.

13:19.758 --> 13:20.713
Privately.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.213
This is a hit list?

13:28.433 --> 13:29.718
We call it a dead pool.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.846
- Recognize any of the names?
- Yeah.

13:32.062 --> 13:34.474
The Sheriff had me run a bunch of these
through the system last night.

13:34.690 --> 13:37.648
- But we couldn't find any of them.
- Show him the other thing.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.024
Okay. That's kind of terrifying.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.945
- What's the number?
- That's how much you're worth.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.038
- I'm worth five dollars?
- Five million.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.658
| only make 40,000 a year.

13:58.297 --> 13:59.912
Maybe I should kill myself.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.544
I don't get it. Why...
Why am | on this?

14:02.759 --> 14:04.499
Honestly, that might be
a question for another day.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.676
Right now, there's still
another third of the list we gotta crack.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.924
We need the third cipher key.

14:09.141 --> 14:11.723
But we need help getting it.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.557
From who?

14:14.771 --> 14:16.386
- Meredith.
- The girl from Eichen?

14:17.607 --> 14:20.519
The last time you saw her, you almost
gave her a nervous breakdown.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.109
Almost.

14:29.745 --> 14:32.987
Sorry, guys, Liam skipped my class.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.704
Maybe he's sick.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.699
Like me.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.539
Liam didn't look sick on our run.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.173
He's not getting back
to any of my texts.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.337
Mine either.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.710
- Yeah, don't worry. I'll find him.
- But text me if you see him.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.086
All right.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.520
Liam?

14:59.733 --> 15:02.975
Sounds like you already
know the answer to that, Scott.

15:10.202 --> 15:11.442
Where is he?

15:11.661 --> 15:12.912
Come on.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.203
Like I'm actually going to tell you that.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.448
- I'll give you the money.
- Yeah, you will.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.372
But that's not going to
get you Liam back.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.295
You're going to have to put in
a little more effort than that.

15:24.508 --> 15:25.543
What do you want?

15:25.759 --> 15:28.171
I want the money. And Violet.

15:28.387 --> 15:30.594
Or you never see Liam again.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.288
Okay, what do you want?

16:02.754 --> 16:04.585
You want me to go to Stilinski?
I can do that.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.997
Or I can talk to my father.
He's an FBI agent.

16:07.175 --> 16:10.258
You think I want you talking
to anyone with a badge?

16:10.470 --> 16:13.382
I'm not getting help from a werewolf
because I want him to talk to someone.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.721
Then what am I supposed to do?

16:16.768 --> 16:19.851
They're transferring Violet
to a Federal facility.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.270
You're not going to let that happen.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.523
- How?
- They're going to put her in a car.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.226
We're going to follow it.
We get ahead of it.

16:28.447 --> 16:29.436
You stop it.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.116
You want me to attack a car?
That's your plan?

16:32.284 --> 16:33.820
You're an Alpha.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.536
If you can't stop one little car,

16:35.745 --> 16:38.327
then one little Beta is going to die.

16:41.751 --> 16:44.993
| stabbed your boy with
a blade dipped in wolfsbane.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.628
Once it gets to the heart,

16:49.176 --> 16:50.586
bad things happen.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.178
Help!

16:57.184 --> 16:58.799
Scott. Is anybody there?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.055
Somebody help me, please.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.886
Help! Somebody help me!

17:03.106 --> 17:06.223
Help. Scott! Scott, help me, please.

17:06.860 --> 17:07.895
Help!

17:14.784 --> 17:17.400
Their Alpha is a woman
named Satomi.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.112
She's one of the
oldest werewolves alive.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.035
And she's learned a lot.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.495
What does that mean?

17:25.420 --> 17:27.502
She's a bitten werewolf.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.670
Learning control wasn't easy for her.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.753
She did something a long time ago
that changed her.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.723
The quote is a mantra.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.267
It helps them with control.

17:43.855 --> 17:44.810
What is it?

17:45.524 --> 17:46.513
Gunpowder.

18:02.791 --> 18:05.783
|f Brett's pack is out here,
I don't think they're meeting.

18:08.713 --> 18:09.873
They're hiding.

18:10.173 --> 18:11.504
We're taking her now.

18:11.716 --> 18:14.549
Dad, isn't that a little dangerous?
I mean, Garrett's still out there.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.171
Maybe we should let someone else do it.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.674
I appreciate the concern,
but after what happened with Katashi

18:18.890 --> 18:22.223
and losing evidence off an armored truck,
I'm not letting this out of my sight.

18:22.477 --> 18:23.557
And if you're still worried,

18:23.770 --> 18:26.762
you should know I've got
Beacon Hills' finest coming with us.

18:40.537 --> 18:41.902
This is not going to work.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.954
All you have to do is stop the car.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.372
I'll take care of the rest.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.683
Oh, no, not this guy.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.394
What the hell are we running here?

19:12.611 --> 19:13.600
A bed and breakfast?

19:14.654 --> 19:17.441
You do notjust open the door
for anyone with a badge.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.693
We need to talk to Meredith Walker.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.075
It involves a murder investigation.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.902
Well, you can talk to her all you want,

19:24.122 --> 19:27.285
but these two, especially that one,
they're outta here.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.786
They're crucial witnesses
in an ongoing investigation.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.494
I wouldn't have brought them here
if it wasn't absolutely

19:33.923 --> 19:34.878
crucial.

19:36.635 --> 19:37.750
Okay, Deputy.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.335
How about you come back
with a court order,

19:40.555 --> 19:41.761
then I'll listen.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.925
As for you, Mr. Stilinski,

19:47.437 --> 19:50.770
how about you come back
with payment in full.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.855
That's right.

19:53.443 --> 19:55.934
Daddy may be the Sheriff,
but he's late on the bills.

19:56.154 --> 20:00.488
I guess those government jobs aren't
as reliable as they used to be, huh?

20:00.742 --> 20:04.234
But they do help when you need a favor.
Like, how a month ago,

20:04.454 --> 20:07.662
Canaan P.D. Helped you get home
after blowing 0.1 on a breathalyzer.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.284
No.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.124
All right.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.920
I'm not against a little quid pro quo.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.050
Not at all.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.758
Not at all.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.634
You. You, I like you.

20:30.605 --> 20:31.936
I'm gonna keep you.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.354
There's a stop sign halt a mile ahead.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.983
So I take out the tires with my claws?

20:45.745 --> 20:48.157
Teeth, claws, heat vision, whatever.

20:48.832 --> 20:50.538
Just stop them.
You ready?

20:53.211 --> 20:54.712
Stop! Stop the car!

21:01.469 --> 21:02.504
Dad!

21:03.179 --> 21:04.134
Dad!

21:06.766 --> 21:07.755
Scott...

21:19.571 --> 21:21.778
She's not in the car. Violet's gone.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.784
Scott, listen to me. Listen.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.491
They're still here.

21:30.707 --> 21:32.413
They're still here.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.304
You want me?

21:46.139 --> 21:47.970
Come on. Come and get me!

21:48.224 --> 21:49.213
Come and get me.

21:57.734 --> 22:00.020
Yeah, that's right! You're not so big.

22:00.904 --> 22:02.110
You're not so big...

22:09.370 --> 22:10.701
Scott!

22:20.381 --> 22:21.996
Meredith, what do you mean
you can't tell us?

22:22.217 --> 22:24.003
We just need the third key.
You can give it to us

22:24.219 --> 22:27.052
in numbers, letters, hieroglyphs.
Whatever you want.

22:27.388 --> 22:28.423
I can't.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.804
Then why did you give us
the second key?

22:31.017 --> 22:32.553
I wanted to help.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.808
That's what I want to do.
I want to help.

22:35.021 --> 22:38.104
Great.
So help us now. Okay?

22:39.275 --> 22:40.936
Give us the third cipher key.

22:41.736 --> 22:44.728
Things have changed.
I... I can't.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.781
- Why not?
- Guys, go easy on her.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.107
I'm sorry.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.613
I can't. He...
He doesn't want me to.

22:51.830 --> 22:52.910
He? Who's he?

22:53.122 --> 22:56.910
Meredith, who doesn't want you
to tell us the third cipher key?

22:58.962 --> 23:00.202
The Benefactor.

23:02.507 --> 23:04.122
Hey, there.

23:04.342 --> 23:07.334
I was actually hoping you would be out
for a few more minutes.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.050
Scott.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.096
This is going to hurt.

23:28.783 --> 23:30.068
You all right?

23:33.997 --> 23:36.534
- Where's my dad and the Sheriff?
- They're at the hospital.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.489
They're both doing fine. Hold this.

23:42.338 --> 23:45.671
It was Kate.
It was her and the Berserkers.

23:45.884 --> 23:48.216
We know.
But they move fast.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.669
And they don't leave much
in the way of tracks.

23:50.889 --> 23:53.380
We have to find her.
She's got Violet.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.386
I think Violet knows where Liam is.

23:56.728 --> 23:59.435
Then as much as this hurt,
it could probably also help.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.103
Can you get a scent?

24:07.196 --> 24:08.402
I'm sorry.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.110
There's nothing to be sorry about.

24:12.327 --> 24:15.819
If they don't want to be found,
then we're not going to find them.

24:16.039 --> 24:18.655
Some werewolves have an ability.

24:19.250 --> 24:22.583
A kind of mastery over their bodies
where they can actually inhibit their scent.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.627
They can hide from other werewolves?

24:25.882 --> 24:27.918
From anyone who's trying to find them.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.874
So that's why nobody knew about Brett.

24:30.261 --> 24:31.717
Same with Demarco.

24:32.722 --> 24:35.304
Maybe we need to
try something different.

24:36.351 --> 24:37.716
Maybe we need to think like Stiles.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.767
Like a hyperactive spaz?

24:40.980 --> 24:43.596
Like a detective.
If they're really Buddhists,

24:43.816 --> 24:46.148
then maybe instead
of asking where werewolves hide,

24:46.402 --> 24:48.984
- we should be asking...
- Where would Buddhists hide.

24:56.329 --> 24:59.742
When Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree,
he looked to the east for enlightenment.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.748
Is there some kind
of eastern point in Beacon Hills?

25:03.294 --> 25:04.579
Yeah.

25:05.630 --> 25:06.995
At Lookout Point.

25:44.627 --> 25:45.616
No, no, no, no, no!

25:54.012 --> 25:55.092
Come on!

25:59.058 --> 26:00.218
You did that.

26:00.935 --> 26:02.345
You went right through it.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.469
I jumped through the window?

26:07.775 --> 26:09.891
The cuts healed
while you were changed.

26:11.029 --> 26:12.394
I guess that's one good thing.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.734
For you. For someone else
it could be really bad.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.236
We need to figure out
how you can get a grip on this.

26:18.453 --> 26:21.069
- I've been trying to do that for years.
- What does your dad say?

26:21.289 --> 26:22.904
He says when kids get angry

26:23.166 --> 26:25.327
they deal with it in one of two ways.

26:26.794 --> 26:28.750
They either hurt themselves

26:29.505 --> 26:30.961
or they hurt someone else.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.203
What's his name?

27:09.462 --> 27:11.373
You could just tell us his name.

27:11.589 --> 27:12.954
Okay, you're shaking your head.
What's that mean?

27:13.174 --> 27:14.960
Does that mean you don't know?
Or you don't want to help us?

27:15.176 --> 27:17.542
I can't...
I can't help anymore.

27:18.346 --> 27:19.552
How do you know about him?

27:20.765 --> 27:22.096
Guys, I think we better stop.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.264
Meredith, a lot of people are going to die
if you don't tell us.

27:24.477 --> 27:26.889
I don't... I don't know.
I don't know. Please...

27:27.105 --> 27:29.221
Meredith, it's okay.
You're gonna be all right.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.017
Please.

27:31.234 --> 27:32.644
I don't... I don't... I don't know.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.236
- Meredith.
- I said,

27:34.445 --> 27:37.608
I don't know!

28:06.227 --> 28:07.433
I worked here.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.727
We used to own the building.
It was part of our business.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.724
I've fought these things before.

28:16.070 --> 28:17.150
They're strong.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.479
Really strong.

28:20.241 --> 28:21.981
That's why I brought this.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.163
I'm good with that.

28:41.012 --> 28:42.218
Malia?

28:42.430 --> 28:43.886
You don't smell that?

28:46.100 --> 28:47.681
Wait for me. Right here.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.259
You shouldn't have come.

29:35.900 --> 29:36.855
Kate.

29:38.236 --> 29:40.443
I'm here for Violet.
I need to talk to her.

29:45.368 --> 29:46.608
I knew you'd find me.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.958
But I was hoping we could do this later.

29:55.878 --> 29:56.993
I just

29:59.006 --> 30:00.712
needed a little more time.

30:02.802 --> 30:03.917
For what?

30:04.136 --> 30:05.592
To learn control.

30:10.893 --> 30:11.928
Lower the gun.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.552
We walk away.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.722
And you don't have to get hurt.

30:18.526 --> 30:19.686
Where's Violet?

30:24.282 --> 30:25.897
Put the gun down, Chris.

30:27.410 --> 30:28.365
Where is she?

30:41.841 --> 30:43.047
No, no!

30:51.642 --> 30:53.257
No, no, stop! No!

31:15.916 --> 31:17.167
What happened?

31:19.503 --> 31:21.243
I think they might have been poisoned.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.203
That's great.

31:23.424 --> 31:26.837
If assassins with guns don't get you,
then the ones with wolfsbane poison will.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.755
Or maybe one with no mouth.

31:28.971 --> 31:30.882
Maybe we should all be
running from Beacon Hills.

31:31.432 --> 31:34.094
Running for our lives.
As fast as we can.

32:57.560 --> 32:58.595
No!

33:06.277 --> 33:07.266
Scott...

33:10.030 --> 33:11.315
Scott.

33:11.907 --> 33:12.942
Scott.

33:22.877 --> 33:24.083
I'm sorry.

33:27.131 --> 33:28.621
I'm not going to find him.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.461
There's still time, Scott.

33:33.554 --> 33:35.010
There's still time.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.175
Okay, well, we know one thing.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.256
Both of the first two keys,
Allison and Aiden,

34:21.477 --> 34:23.308
they're both names of the dead. Right?

34:24.647 --> 34:27.138
But we've already tried every other
dead person's name we could think of.

34:27.358 --> 34:28.564
And if you haven't noticed,

34:28.776 --> 34:30.858
- there were a lot of tries.
- Yeah, I noticed.

34:36.075 --> 34:37.155
You okay?

34:37.660 --> 34:39.946
The only other Banshee I've ever met.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.992
And I think I might have
just drove her over the edge.

34:45.084 --> 34:46.665
Lydia, it wasn't your fault.

34:47.795 --> 34:49.126
I was there, too.

34:51.006 --> 34:52.837
And you're probably not the only...

34:57.221 --> 34:58.210
Hold on.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.222
Banshees predict death.

35:03.185 --> 35:06.427
Right? So what if the third key
is someone who isn't dead...

35:06.855 --> 35:08.061
But will be.

35:58.157 --> 35:59.567
Call Parrish.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.068
We need to call Parrish.

36:36.612 --> 36:37.692
You're okay, Liam.

36:41.950 --> 36:42.905
You're okay.

36:50.918 --> 36:52.499
What are you talking about?

36:53.045 --> 36:56.128
Lydia, Meredith's gone.

36:56.799 --> 36:59.757
They found her an hour ago in her room.
She hung herself.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.005
I'm sorry.

37:41.802 --> 37:43.838
I don't want to keep watching people die.

37:47.558 --> 37:48.638
Maybe I do.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.307
That's a lot of burden to carry, Scott.

37:52.396 --> 37:53.385
I don't care.

37:56.734 --> 37:57.974
No one else dies.

37:58.527 --> 38:00.859
Everyone on that list.
Everyone on that dead pool.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.691
It doesn't matter if they're Wendigos,

38:03.907 --> 38:05.772
or werewolves, or whatever.

38:09.580 --> 38:10.990
I'm gonna save everyone.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.219
You counted it yet?

38:36.273 --> 38:37.353
No.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.479
We should probably count it.

39:14.812 --> 39:18.646
I suppose you're hiding down here
because it'll cover your scent.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.560
But I can smell a rat.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.273
Even in a sewer.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.239
It's getting worse, isn't it?

39:29.785 --> 39:32.618
The surges of anger.
The loss of control.

39:32.830 --> 39:35.116
You know, I used to get angry.

39:35.874 --> 39:41.244
As a kid, I would even break my own toys
in little fits of rage.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.044
And then I asked myself,

39:43.799 --> 39:46.586
"Why break your own toys
when you can break someone else's?"

39:46.802 --> 39:49.544
Stop pitching and just
tell me what you want.

39:49.805 --> 39:53.639
Obviously, we're in a position
of mutually assured destruction.

39:55.561 --> 39:58.428
Oh, I'm not so sure
the scales are that balanced.

40:00.774 --> 40:01.763
Probably true.

40:02.568 --> 40:06.732
But I know you want to
get the family back together again.

40:06.947 --> 40:10.610
The return of the Argents
to their glorious power. Am I right?

40:12.744 --> 40:14.280
But you know,

40:14.496 --> 40:17.329
you can't go back unless
you can exhibit absolute

40:17.541 --> 40:18.951
and total control.

40:19.209 --> 40:22.417
I can offer control.
I can teach you.

40:23.547 --> 40:26.710
So, you're willing to teach me
in order to get what you want.

40:27.551 --> 40:30.759
- Which is what?
- Obviously, I want my money back.

40:32.514 --> 40:33.549
That's not it.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.016
Maybe part of it.

40:36.143 --> 40:37.758
But that's not all you want.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.387
I need the money.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.311
Yes.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.692
But I'll admit,

40:50.532 --> 40:52.272
money only gets you

40:53.577 --> 40:54.737
so far.

40:56.705 --> 40:57.945
What I want

40:59.249 --> 41:01.740
is what I've always wanted.

41:07.799 --> 41:08.879
Power.
