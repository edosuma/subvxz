01:49.692 --> 01:51.986
It's a shitty frame job.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.907
The killer didn't stage the body
in my apartment.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.660
She didn't make sure I had no alibi.

01:58.743 --> 02:01.246
She's sloppy.
Acts out of emotion.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.542
We have that in common.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.024
So much for good behavior.

03:11.107 --> 03:15.153
Yeah, well, it was an external action
to soothe internal strife.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.196
They will put you in a stronger cell.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.823
I'm not sticking around for that.

03:18.907 --> 03:19.908
We'll see.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.455
What am I still doing here?
It's been 24 hours.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.738
The police have 72 hours
before they have to charge you.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.501
Trish already gave a statement.
They have no proof.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.171
They believe you know things
you're not telling them.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.548
Yeah, it's called professional discretion.

03:35.632 --> 03:39.552
They will call it obstruction of justice.
It's a probation violation.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.429
Shit.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.557
That'll put me away for 18 months.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.142
Unless you tell them what you know.

03:47.852 --> 03:50.188
A poodle doesn't show its belly
to a pit bull

03:50.271 --> 03:51.981
if it doesn't want its guts ripped out.

03:53.149 --> 03:55.485
And you're the poodle, or...

03:55.568 --> 03:58.613
They will lump me in with that maniac.

03:58.696 --> 04:01.282
And they will start pinning
every unsolved crime on me,

04:01.366 --> 04:02.533
because that's what they do.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.661
Mm-hmm. Not that you have a chip
on your shoulder.

04:04.744 --> 04:05.912
Just fix this!

04:05.995 --> 04:08.748
Don't snap at me.

04:11.125 --> 04:14.337
You're the one that sent Pryce after me,
so stop dicking around.

04:15.171 --> 04:17.673
You are far from my biggest concern
at the moment.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.053
Oh, what? So now I'm on my own?

04:22.136 --> 04:24.931
Only if you keep alienating everyone
around you.

04:35.692 --> 04:39.237
Uh-oh... It's okay, Pats.

04:39.821 --> 04:40.947
I'm here.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.078
Oh, my God. What did you take?

04:47.161 --> 04:51.874
Nothing. Nothing. I'm okay.
I've got a... I've got a bug.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.962
Please, I've taken you to rehab
too many times to buy that crap.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.880
I'm all right.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.934
This isn't like last time.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.453
Then I must be having déjà vu.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.106
'Cause you sure look like
your old, strung-out self.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.400
There you go. All right.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.069
Eyes up.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.906
Oh, thank you.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.745
Look, thank you for, uh...

05:29.662 --> 05:32.707
for taking care of me
and bailing me out and everything.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.709
I just... I'm...

05:35.543 --> 05:37.795
I'm gonna be okay. I'm fine now.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.756
I should think so, after sleeping so long.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.675
- What?
- But we've got a big day today.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.219
We've gotta choose the right wardrobe.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.766
Wait. How long have I been asleep?

05:52.351 --> 05:55.021
Mother, how long have I been asleep?

05:55.104 --> 05:56.939
About 26 hours.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.150
I lost a whole day?

05:59.233 --> 06:01.277
Don't worry,
I covered for you at the radio station.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.071
So, this is the one.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.490
You shower. I'll heat up the flat iron.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.826
I don't have time to play dress-up.
I have to call Jessica.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.037
- Jessica is in jail.
- What...

06:11.120 --> 06:12.288
Which is where she should be.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.051
We don't know if she killed that poor man.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.124
Of course she didn't.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.586
Either way, she's got that fancy lawyer.
There's nothing you can do for her.

06:18.669 --> 06:22.799
- No, you don't understand...
- I understand better than anyone.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.967
Jess has always brought out
the worst in you

06:25.051 --> 06:27.053
and I won't watch it
cost you another career.

06:27.136 --> 06:30.014
- This is not about my career.
- ZCN called.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.768
- What?
- Cable news, Pats. This is big-time.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.520
They wanted a meeting with you.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.314
When?

06:38.397 --> 06:39.816
Today.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.610
Don't worry. We'll be on time.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.740
The rest of your life is waiting.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.743
I'm gonna get in the shower.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.788
It's all gone?

06:53.871 --> 06:56.749
Yeah, your computer,
our files, everything IGH.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.459
Shit.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.796
Hands off the gun, itchy fingers.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.714
The guy took everything.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.551
I guess Pryce was casing the place
when he came to recruit me.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.595
- And I should have known, but...
- It's okay. I'm not mad at you.

07:09.679 --> 07:13.850
- Have they got you on sedatives?
- No, I'm just trying something new.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.810
Apparently, I'm alienating.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.355
It's time to earn your 20%.

07:19.939 --> 07:20.939
Excuse me?

07:21.816 --> 07:23.985
I need your help.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.653
Excuse me?

07:25.736 --> 07:27.613
Don't goddamn push me, Malcolm.

07:27.697 --> 07:28.697
Um...

07:29.365 --> 07:30.616
I'm all in. Go.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.870
My friend,
the one that's staying with you?

07:35.496 --> 07:36.497
Yeah.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.835
Find out everything she knows
about her former employers

07:40.918 --> 07:43.838
and about her coworker
who suddenly left the company.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.883
Got it. What else?

07:47.717 --> 07:48.885
Everything else.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.096
At least until I can get out
of this hellhole.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.264
When's that gonna be?

07:53.347 --> 07:56.476
Depends on if I can get through
this next part without losing my shit.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.479
You didn't do the crime. Truth matters.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.898
Not if nobody wants
to believe it.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.568
You're in charge of Alias.
Don't mess it up.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.162
Bummer. You didn't get to shoot me.

Hi! It's just your neighbor.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.616
Sophie. Remember?
We met at the yard sale.

10:18.826 --> 10:21.704
- Something wrong?
- I'm losing my mind.

10:21.787 --> 10:25.207
Aaron is teething,
and he's been screaming at me for hours.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.628
- He's not screaming now.
- Because of your music.

10:28.711 --> 10:32.006
We were walking past,
he heard it and calmed right down.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.635
Isn't that right, you little monster?

10:37.678 --> 10:41.098
- Well, I was just practicing.
- Well, he is a big fan.

10:41.182 --> 10:45.519
Would you mind if we came in and listened?
Honestly, I could use a break.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.105
Would you like to hold him?

10:52.026 --> 10:53.069
Yes, I would.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.634
- Come in.
- Thank you.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.473
I can't remember
the last time I heard a song

11:22.556 --> 11:24.308
that wasn't about farm animals.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.853
Your home is so cool.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.398
Marcus and I have to have you
over sometime.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.359
I don't get out much.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.069
Come here, baby.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.488
Oh! Ooh...

11:41.659 --> 11:43.077
No.

12:00.594 --> 12:04.473
♪ Not much money, oh, but, honey... ♪

12:08.144 --> 12:09.603

- Please.

We're crashing your practice.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.109
No, no, no. It's okay.

12:25.786 --> 12:29.081
It's okay. It's okay. Shh, Aaron...

12:29.165 --> 12:30.875
Oh, oh, please.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.217
Are you all right?

12:44.763 --> 12:45.931
You know, I just...

12:46.015 --> 12:48.225
He's been terrible today. I...

13:20.841 --> 13:22.718
I can't guarantee
that this is gonna work.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.137
Well, it better.
I'm taking your legal advice.

13:25.221 --> 13:28.974
I gave you that advice this morning.
Now it might be too little, too late.

13:30.809 --> 13:31.810
Afternoon.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.316
Comfortable in your, uh, new digs?

13:37.399 --> 13:39.276
Like a veal for slaughter.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.764
Your lawyer tells us you want
to make a statement.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.116
Did you bring my phone?

13:53.290 --> 13:56.919
This woman killed Nick Spanos
and Robert Coleman.

13:57.753 --> 13:58.963
She also has abilities.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.549
- Like you?
- No.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.260
She's stronger.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.762
A lot stronger.

14:06.845 --> 14:09.139
- You got a name on her?
- Not yet.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.100
But we were both patients

14:11.183 --> 14:13.852
at an off-the-grid experimental program
called IGH.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.981
They tried to heal people
using genetic editing.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.233
But there were side effects.

14:19.316 --> 14:22.486
- This IGH gave you abilities?
- Looks that way.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.238
You forgot to mention these experiments

14:24.321 --> 14:26.401
or this other enhanced person
when we questioned you.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.535
- Because you can't take her.
- But you can?

14:32.162 --> 14:35.124
You have proof of any of this?

14:35.958 --> 14:39.044
The best I can do
is tell you everything I know.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.092
I'll start at the beginning.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.355
You don't know
who you worked for?

14:48.429 --> 14:50.806
- Not their names.
- "They"? Was it more than one person?

14:52.433 --> 14:55.644
- Did they pay you to keep quiet?
- I keep quiet to stay alive.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.688
Unlike the nurse you worked with.

14:59.523 --> 15:00.691
Luanne McClure?

15:02.610 --> 15:03.652
Where did you find that?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.863
There's an online black market
for crime scene pics.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.323
People pay money to see that?

15:07.406 --> 15:09.742
You said Luanne was killed in the clinic,

15:09.825 --> 15:13.120
but her body was found in a bathtub
in a guy's apartment.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.081
Get that out of my face.
I spent years trying to unsee that shit.

15:16.165 --> 15:19.168
Just help me try to understand something.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.421
If the powered woman we're looking for
killed Luanne, then why...

15:23.672 --> 15:26.175
Why is this guy doing time
for Luanne's murder?

15:35.684 --> 15:38.604
Hey, I get that you're scared.

15:39.730 --> 15:40.731
Really.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.484
But you have to trust me.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.527
This is what we do.

15:49.573 --> 15:50.574
Sit down.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.711
Start at the beginning.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.347
- What is taking so long?
- It's a lot to process.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.445
What's the matter?
Why do you look like that?

16:19.520 --> 16:20.521
Trying not to vomit.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.856
'Cause I'm screwed.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.234
Side effects from my goddamn medication.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.962
Ran a search on your photo.
Didn't find a name or any criminal record.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.565
Because she's off the grid.
I'm telling you the truth.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.716
- I know.
- I don't.

16:48.799 --> 16:52.678
- Let's stick with knowing. How?
- It's a couple of stills taken

16:52.761 --> 16:55.305
from a network of security cameras
in the area.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.475
That's taken just before the time
of Nick Spanos' death.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.687
- That's right in front of my building.
- Now, wait for it...

17:03.313 --> 17:04.690
It's a hell of a leap.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.568
And?

17:13.574 --> 17:15.325
That's it? I'm free to go?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.411
Not if I had my way.

17:18.119 --> 17:22.040
I think you two are working together.
I know how you people like to team up.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.250
"You people"?

17:23.959 --> 17:26.295
There's no reason to keep you
if you cooperate.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.255
Great. Uh, thank you, Detective.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.632
Uh, Jessica, I'll meet you outside.

17:40.934 --> 17:44.938
Hey, listen, just in case you come up
with anything else for us...

17:45.022 --> 17:47.024
One show-and-tell
doesn't make us partners.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.942
You want to go it alone, that's your call.

17:49.026 --> 17:52.154
But there's a lot of people on the force
that wanna see you locked up.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.865
And you're the only white hat
in a sea of black hats.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.700
Not the only one.

17:56.784 --> 18:00.496
There's a few of us here who remember
what Kilgrave did in this precinct.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.917
I had nightmares
of holding my own gun to my head.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.629
The feeling of my finger on the trigger.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.967
I recommend hypnosis.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.637
I didn't need that, because, uh...

18:17.971 --> 18:20.891
the dreams stopped the day
you took that asshole out.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.706
- Thanks.
- Doing my job.

18:45.707 --> 18:48.335
I'll do my job and get the leverage
you want on your firm.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.046
But I need something else first.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.632
Did you read the story
of The Giving Tree as a kid?

18:53.715 --> 18:55.217
The tree ends up a dead stump.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.719
I'm not anxious to go there
any sooner than I have to.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.265
I just need a safe house.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.560
The kind you use
for your witness protection clients.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.479
What kind of witness are we talking about?

19:08.272 --> 19:10.149
The kind that needs protection?

19:10.232 --> 19:12.152
So we're going back
to the old secretive Jessica.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.279
- Because that worked for you in jail.
- Shit. Fine.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.825
I found someone who used to work for IGH.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.579
You left that out of your statement
with the police.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.874
Because this woman's safety
is my responsibility.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.462
- Okay, get her to me. I'll handle it.
- Handle it how?

19:32.546 --> 19:33.797
So it's handled.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.550
Your paranoia is exhausting.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.013
Where the hell are you going?

19:42.890 --> 19:44.725
Where's my computer, asshole?

19:44.808 --> 19:46.685
Don't engage with him, Jessica.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.008
Can't believe they let you out.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.606
I can't believe they didn't arrest you
for stealing my shit.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.775
Oh, I heard everything you did to Nick.
Every scream.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.403
We survived two wars together until you.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.531
- It wasn't me.
- Pryce, you are embarrassing yourself.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.075
You're the embarrassment, Jeri.
Helping her out?

20:02.701 --> 20:04.578
Huh? What was it, bribery? Perjury?

20:04.661 --> 20:05.787
- I'll find out.
- Hey.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.372
Get your head out of your ass, Cheng.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.750
Or what? What are you gonna do, huh?
Take me out, too?

20:09.833 --> 20:11.293
I've seen you in action.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.296
I've seen that look in your eye.
You're a killer.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.467
Not today, I'm not.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.011
Today, I'm free.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.221
Do you know why?

20:23.013 --> 20:25.682
No, 'cause you're a shitty investigator.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.645
So go talk to the cops,
go steal someone else's cases.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.396
You know what? Go beat off in the corner,

20:31.480 --> 20:33.607
because I don't give
a dead moose's last shit.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.984
I'm gonna find the actual killer.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.930
I bought you a new one.
I mean, Alias bought it.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.850
Looks good, though, huh?
Little paint, little cleaning.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.437
I need a drink.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.653
- Hey, how you holding up?
- Just trapped in a hellish flashback.

21:19.736 --> 21:22.739
I know the feeling.
You know what's great for that?

21:24.116 --> 21:26.076
Oh, come on. They took my booze, too?

21:37.087 --> 21:40.299
Well, what else did you find,
besides new places to put all my shit?

21:45.262 --> 21:46.513
Here.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.021
That's David Kawecki.

21:54.104 --> 21:57.607
He was the janitor at IGH.
Luanne's body was found in his apartment.

21:57.691 --> 21:58.859
He confessed to the murder.

21:58.942 --> 22:01.862
But Inez says that he wasn't even there
when it happened.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.404
Right?

22:03.739 --> 22:05.949
Everyone lies. That's for damn sure.

22:06.033 --> 22:08.410
It says here he has the IQ
of a ten-year-old.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.973
Court found him mentally incompetent.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.497
- He's doing life in Birch Psych Hospital.
- It's horseshit.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.999
Dave was harmless.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.334
Are you sure?

22:16.460 --> 22:18.879
You think I could forget the woman
who almost crippled me?

22:18.962 --> 22:21.923
You think I don't see her face
every time I close my eyes?

22:22.007 --> 22:23.800
Hey, take a break.

22:23.884 --> 22:27.846
Go to my apartment, lock the door.
I'll be there in a minute.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.777
- Jesus.
- Yeah, she is special.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.112
The killer likes to pin her shit
on other people.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.740
This dude Kawecki is doing her time.

22:46.823 --> 22:47.866
Question is, why?

22:49.326 --> 22:50.827
I'll ask him when I see him.

22:50.911 --> 22:51.912
Already tried.

22:51.995 --> 22:55.040
Kawecki's kept
in the hospital's high-security wing.

22:55.123 --> 22:57.334
Only guards and shrinks with IDs
allowed in.

22:57.417 --> 22:58.585
I got it from here.

22:59.377 --> 23:01.671
You get Inez to Jeri Hogarth.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.216
At this address.

23:07.302 --> 23:08.804
Tell her you're my associate.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.641
Wait, did... Did you just promote me?

23:12.724 --> 23:14.142
Maybe.

23:16.353 --> 23:19.523
- Does it come with a raise?
- No. Get going.

23:20.148 --> 23:23.652
Whatever you say, associate.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.320
I'm instantly regretting this.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.372
Inez?

23:41.253 --> 23:42.671
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

23:57.310 --> 23:58.311
Hey!

23:59.563 --> 24:01.243
You're gonna have to go all the way
to 37th

24:01.314 --> 24:03.483
before you find a pawn shop
that'll take a hot TV.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.653
That's where I used to sell shit
when I was a junkie.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.176
They don't sweat the serial numbers.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.115
I bet you can buy it back from them
real cheap.

24:10.198 --> 24:13.743
Look, I am not the person that you need
to be running from right now.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.037
I'm just trying to get you someplace safe.

24:16.580 --> 24:20.041
Yeah, that last place was real safe.
Except for the homicide out front.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.686
- What?
- I'll take my chances on my own.

24:21.710 --> 24:25.088
Yeah, and what? Your big idea is
to sell my TV for a couple of bucks?

24:25.172 --> 24:26.756
Enough to get out of town.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.967
Look, the killer will find you. All right?

24:29.050 --> 24:32.429
And when she does, you can't stop her.

24:32.512 --> 24:35.015
- No one can.
- Jessica can. She has a plan.

24:35.098 --> 24:37.934
Yeah, which part of that plan
included her going to jail?

24:38.018 --> 24:41.563
- Tell your boss thanks, but no thanks.
- All right, cool.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.649
You don't want to climb on board,
be the bait in the water.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.866
The hell is that supposed to mean?

24:53.658 --> 24:56.161
Killer's taking out people
who worked for IGH.

24:56.244 --> 24:59.581
I could post your location online,
wait for her to come to us.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.668
You wouldn't do that.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.341
I'll do whatever it takes.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.554
You win.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.242
Hey.

25:35.867 --> 25:36.993
They let you out?

25:37.619 --> 25:39.246
Sorry about all the cops.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.206
Told 'em you had nothing to do with it.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.250
Come on. Come in.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.423
So, what makes you so sure?

25:51.633 --> 25:54.678
I don't think the woman that saved
Vido's life is capable of murder.

25:54.761 --> 25:56.012
I still owe you for that.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.808
About that. I may need to collect.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.268
How about dinner?

26:02.644 --> 26:03.770
Like a date?

26:03.853 --> 26:05.021
Or just dinner?

26:05.605 --> 26:06.606
Or...

26:08.984 --> 26:10.944
do you have something else in mind?

26:11.027 --> 26:12.362
Uh...

26:13.905 --> 26:17.492
Let's say, hypothetically, I needed
to get into a secure psych ward.

26:17.575 --> 26:20.662
- You want me to commit you?
- As a therapist.

26:21.788 --> 26:25.000
And let's say that I needed the right ID.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.090
And in this hypothetical situation,

26:32.173 --> 26:34.342
you need someone
who could forge documents?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.011
Someone that owed me a favor.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.375
Who'd risk their family's safety
to break the law for you.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.057
- That's a big ask.
- I know.

26:52.610 --> 26:54.821
I need the name of the hospital
and three hours.

26:54.904 --> 26:55.905
Thank you.

26:56.614 --> 26:58.116
I'm also gonna need a photo.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.378
Don't smile.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.054
Griffin?

27:20.096 --> 27:22.223
- It's Trish. She needs you, now.
- Why?

27:22.307 --> 27:25.393
- I'll text you the address.
- Griffin? Ugh.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.442
Hurry up!

27:35.153 --> 27:39.657
- Why does ZCN want to meet out here?
- Ambiance is everything.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.659
- Last looks.
- Mother.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.121
- It's better.
- Yeah?

27:48.833 --> 27:53.463
You know what they say,
"Always put your best face forward."

27:53.922 --> 27:55.298
"Best foot."

27:55.382 --> 27:57.217
No one's gonna be looking
at your feet, Pats.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.678
Okay, let's not keep them waiting.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.848
You look beautiful.

28:05.433 --> 28:06.434
Okay.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.279
- Who are all those...
- Hey.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.824
Wait, I know him.

28:23.660 --> 28:24.661
Is that...

28:25.954 --> 28:28.498
Is that Aunt Alice and Uncle Tim?

28:28.581 --> 28:31.418
Okay, Mother,
if this is another intervention,

28:31.501 --> 28:33.878
- please, I don't need it...
- Shh. No, no, no.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.797
This morning will be our little secret.

28:36.464 --> 28:37.465
Trish!

28:38.550 --> 28:40.760
I came as soon as I could.
Are you okay?

28:40.844 --> 28:41.845
Jess, what...

28:41.928 --> 28:46.141

28:46.224 --> 28:49.436

29:11.916 --> 29:12.917
Hey.

29:15.211 --> 29:16.045
Hi.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.090
So, I brought our friends
and family together

29:19.174 --> 29:21.718
because, well,
I want you to feel pressured.

29:21.801 --> 29:25.221
And because your answer means
too much to me to leave any wiggle room.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.604
Fortunately,
we only have to do this part once.

29:27.682 --> 29:29.100
I ask, you answer.

29:30.727 --> 29:31.728
But something's wrong.

29:33.229 --> 29:34.439
Your hand is naked.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.441
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

29:49.829 --> 29:52.165
It's all right, the stone's conflict-free.

29:55.710 --> 29:57.545
What do you say, Trish Walker?

29:58.588 --> 30:01.633
I'm asking you to marry me.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.685
Thank you.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.415
Hi.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.836
Hey, Griffin,
so happy for you, mate.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.797
- Congratulations.
- You really surprised her.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.423
We're so happy for you.

30:45.343 --> 30:48.596
- Great to see you.
- Oh, hi!

30:48.680 --> 30:50.431
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

30:50.890 --> 30:52.308
How was jail?

30:53.059 --> 30:56.062
How does that plant taste?
Keep talking if you wanna find out.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.986
Hey, thanks for the heads-up.

31:03.069 --> 31:05.238
After that tabloid stunt,
can you blame me?

31:05.321 --> 31:06.906
I can keep a secret.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.033
So can you, apparently.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.327
Hey, took some sneaking around,

31:12.120 --> 31:16.416
hacking into her computer
for her contacts, but she's worth it.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.377
Hey!

31:19.460 --> 31:20.461
Hey.

31:21.337 --> 31:22.338
Hey, Jess.

31:23.548 --> 31:26.593
All I want is to make Trish happy.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.929
I hope you can let that happen,
at least today.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.348
Thanks for coming.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.644
- Jess.
- Hey.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.397
When did you get out? Are you okay?

31:40.648 --> 31:42.233
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.195
Just go, enjoy this.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.074
I'm happy for you.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.842
"Thank you" means yes, right?

32:10.553 --> 32:11.638
I'm sorry, uh...

32:12.972 --> 32:14.724
I'm a mess. Um...

32:15.975 --> 32:17.894
Can we go somewhere and talk?

32:20.104 --> 32:21.272
- Sure.
- Okay.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.579
You work for Jessica.

32:36.663 --> 32:39.207
I'm her associate. Malcolm Ducasse.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.292
I didn't realize
that Jessica had associates.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.002
Well, I just got promoted.

32:43.419 --> 32:46.255
Uh... This is Inez.

32:46.965 --> 32:47.966
Please come in.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.807
Hell of an upgrade
from the last armpit I was staying in.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.351
Just keep an eye on your TV.

33:00.019 --> 33:01.771
You take care of yourself, Inez.

33:01.854 --> 33:03.856
You're the worst kind of person.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.359
You pretend to care.

33:06.442 --> 33:08.194
But you're not about helping anybody.

33:08.945 --> 33:10.113
Except yourself.

33:12.490 --> 33:15.243
Sounds like Jessica's people skills
are rubbing off on you.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.746
That's a good thing.
I don't pay her to be popular.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.623
Nice to meet you, Malcolm Ducasse.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.588
- Is someone there?
- The door, Vido.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.007
Yes, Grandma.

33:33.302 --> 33:36.222
- Hey.
- Hey, Super Lady. Come in.

33:37.598 --> 33:38.850
Who's there, Vido?

33:38.933 --> 33:42.228
- Ah. Hello. How are you?
- Hello.

33:42.311 --> 33:44.397
So this is the girl.

33:45.773 --> 33:48.526
Can she stay for dinner, Grandma?

33:48.609 --> 33:50.653
Can you stay for dinner?
Please?

33:50.737 --> 33:52.537
If it's all right
with your papi.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.907
Papi would love
if she stayed for dinner.

33:54.991 --> 33:56.909
All right, calm down.

33:57.493 --> 33:58.369
Oye.

33:58.453 --> 33:59.537
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.748
Your new friend is
very pretty.

34:02.331 --> 34:05.960
Sorry, they came with the apartment.
I can't get rid of them.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.795
They're cute,
in an obnoxious way.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.355
This should get you where you need to go.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.261
I appreciate it.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.266
- I should go.
- Want to stay for dinner?

34:20.349 --> 34:22.060
My mom makes a mean ropa vieja.

34:22.143 --> 34:25.980
- I can smell that. But I gotta work.
- What work? It's late.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.815
I think and I drink.
It's a whole process.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.735
Well, let me get you started.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.578
Spañada?

34:40.661 --> 34:43.331
It's like sangria. Mama's favorite.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.917
Gets better after the third glass.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.960
It's actually the first thing
I got drunk on.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.755
My parents used to keep it
around the house.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.507
My first was rum.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.426
Killed mojitos for me.

34:57.637 --> 34:58.638
I gotta go.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.391
Good luck.

35:02.475 --> 35:05.019
- Bye, Super Lady!
- Come on.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.479
Let's eat.

35:06.562 --> 35:08.815
- Grandma, sit. Let's eat.
- Yes, yes.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.066
I'm very hungry.

35:10.149 --> 35:11.567
Hungry, hungry, hungry.

35:11.651 --> 35:14.612
Rice. Okay.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.072
Black beans.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.073
Let's go.

35:17.156 --> 35:19.784
Do not put too much food on your plate.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.324
Coffee?

36:01.409 --> 36:02.451
How did you sleep?

36:05.621 --> 36:07.039
That bed's ridiculous.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.085
What are those sheets even made out of?

36:11.836 --> 36:14.964
Egyptian cotton.
Very generous thread count.

36:18.342 --> 36:19.969
Would you like some breakfast?

36:21.846 --> 36:22.847
Sure.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.392
- But can I ask you something?
- Of course.

36:26.475 --> 36:27.768
Would you cut the crap?

36:28.436 --> 36:30.897
A woman like you,
with awards and all that,

36:30.980 --> 36:33.482
you don't just invite in
some stranger off the streets,

36:33.566 --> 36:34.567
give the royal treatment.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.611
I have an agreement with Jessica
to keep you safe.

36:36.694 --> 36:39.071
Well, there are plenty of places
to keep me safe.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.781
Why dirty your fancy sheets?

36:43.951 --> 36:45.369
Tell me what you want from me.

36:45.995 --> 36:46.996
Really.

36:48.247 --> 36:49.248
Or I'm leaving.

36:52.877 --> 36:58.424
I want to know everything
that you know about IGH.

37:01.260 --> 37:03.638
Specifically, about the experiments.

37:13.898 --> 37:14.899
ID.

37:31.874 --> 37:33.000
Hold up a minute.

37:37.838 --> 37:38.839
New coat.

37:39.423 --> 37:40.800
Looks good.

37:40.883 --> 37:42.677
Someone got blood on my last one.

38:09.578 --> 38:10.871
Wait here.

38:32.518 --> 38:34.520
He's ready. You can start.

38:34.603 --> 38:36.731
I'll be fine in here alone with him.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.859
It helps me establish trust.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.612
We'll be right outside this door.

38:50.786 --> 38:51.787
Hello.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.332
Hello, Mr. Kawecki.

38:56.292 --> 38:57.960
Do you prefer David?

38:58.711 --> 38:59.712
Dave?

39:01.339 --> 39:05.676
Well, hello, Dave, I'm your new therapist.
And you can call me Anne.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.846
It's 10:30. That's recreation time.

39:08.929 --> 39:11.974
Is it okay to talk
while you work on your picture?

39:13.851 --> 39:16.228
Well, for our first session,

39:16.312 --> 39:18.481
I'd like for you to tell me
why you're here.

39:18.981 --> 39:20.524
That was all a long time ago.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.986
I know, but it's very important
for your therapy.

39:25.821 --> 39:29.200
Why don't you start
by telling me about Luanne?

39:32.370 --> 39:33.496
She was pretty.

39:34.705 --> 39:35.998
And she was nice to me.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.794
She was the reason
I liked going to work every day.

39:39.877 --> 39:42.546
- And where did you work?
- At a hospital.

39:43.547 --> 39:46.300
I emptied trash cans,
I cleaned the floors.

39:47.051 --> 39:51.305
And do you remember anyone else
who worked there? Besides Luanne?

39:51.389 --> 39:53.307
I... I forget things.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.644
Were you and Luanne friends?

39:56.727 --> 39:58.687
I wanted her
to be my girlfriend.

39:59.688 --> 40:01.690
But she said it couldn't be like that.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.692
And what happened after that?

40:05.861 --> 40:08.656
One night, I took Luanne home,
and I held her.

40:09.698 --> 40:12.034
She started to scream, and I got angry.

40:12.118 --> 40:13.786
So I held her tighter.

40:13.869 --> 40:16.247
And the next thing I know,
Luanne's in the bathtub...

40:17.206 --> 40:19.458
and she isn't screaming anymore.

40:20.167 --> 40:21.502
That's quite a story.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.798
Are you sure that's what happened?

40:27.633 --> 40:29.385
I took Luanne home, and I held her...

40:29.468 --> 40:31.595
I heard you. I just don't believe you.

40:32.638 --> 40:34.765
How did you get Luanne back
to your apartment?

40:35.391 --> 40:36.631
She just came with me, I guess.

40:36.684 --> 40:39.061
- You guess?
- I mean, that's what happened.

40:39.145 --> 40:42.398
You held her and the next thing
you remember, she was dead?

40:42.481 --> 40:44.150
So you don't remember killing her?

40:44.233 --> 40:45.985
I don't know. I told you, I forget things.

40:46.068 --> 40:50.239
You saw the life leave her eyes.
That is hard to forget, Dave, believe me.

40:50.322 --> 40:52.950
- I don't want to talk about this.
- Because it's not true, is it?

40:53.033 --> 40:54.535
I think you're protecting someone.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.955
- Is it someone in your family?
- My family's dead.

40:58.038 --> 41:00.124
Whoever it is,
they're letting you rot in here,

41:00.207 --> 41:02.293
while Luanne's murderer is out there,
hurting people.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.376
No!

41:03.419 --> 41:07.214
You can still help Luanne, Dave.
Tell me who killed her.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.176
I did! I killed her!
Why don't you believe me?

41:22.104 --> 41:23.355
It's okay, Dave.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.483
I believe you.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.485
Okay?

41:28.903 --> 41:30.070
I believe you.

41:30.988 --> 41:31.989
It's okay.

41:39.872 --> 41:42.625
Hey, are octopuses your favorite animal?

41:45.002 --> 41:47.213
Did you know octopuses have no bones?

41:47.963 --> 41:51.342
A 600-pound octopus can fit through
a hole the size of a quarter.

41:51.425 --> 41:55.471
And you know what it's like to be
a big guy in a small space, right?

41:55.554 --> 41:58.182
Octopuses like to live alone, too,
like me.

41:58.265 --> 41:59.850
They don't even raise their babies.

42:01.310 --> 42:05.981
Did you know that
no other DNA is like an octopus'?

42:07.942 --> 42:09.235
Their DNA?

42:11.362 --> 42:12.530
Are you sure?

42:12.613 --> 42:14.532
No one knows where their genes come from.

42:15.115 --> 42:17.743
They're called de novo,
which means "out of nowhere."

42:17.826 --> 42:20.788
And how do you know so much
about octopus genes?

42:20.871 --> 42:22.957
My friend Dr. Karl told me.

42:34.510 --> 42:39.765
And does Dr. Karl like octopuses, too?

42:41.475 --> 42:44.812
Yeah. He likes them so much,
he'd eat lunch at the aquarium every day.

42:45.980 --> 42:48.023
I used to go with him sometimes.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.234
We'd sit by the octopus tank,

42:50.317 --> 42:54.196
and he'd share his sandwich with me,
and he'd tell me all kinds of things.

42:55.447 --> 42:58.659
Did Dr. Karl also tell you
that you killed Luanne?

43:00.077 --> 43:02.454
I don't want to talk
about Dr. Karl anymore.

43:05.749 --> 43:07.543
Would you draw a picture for me?

43:08.586 --> 43:11.589
Of you and Dr. Karl
watching the octopuses together?

43:37.281 --> 43:38.782
Pats, are you here?

43:40.743 --> 43:42.453
I just spoke with Griffin.

43:42.536 --> 43:45.247
Should've known you'd find some way
to mess this up.

43:45.331 --> 43:48.500
I didn't mess anything up, Mother.
This is what I want.

43:48.584 --> 43:51.670
You don't know what you want.
You're a different person on drugs.

43:51.754 --> 43:54.673
I'm stone cold sober.

43:56.759 --> 44:00.679
Call him. Maybe he'll take you back
if you plead insanity.

44:00.763 --> 44:02.014
I don't want him back.

44:03.015 --> 44:05.100
I knew it as soon as I got to the roof.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.313
- That proposal was breathtaking.
- It was heartbreaking.

44:10.773 --> 44:13.067
Because the moment
I figured out what it was,

44:13.859 --> 44:18.572
that it wasn't a meeting with ZCN,
all I could feel was disappointment.

44:18.656 --> 44:21.408
- Oh, Jesus...
- That's why I said no.

44:21.492 --> 44:26.080
Listen, baby, you gotta listen to me.
You are making a huge mistake.

44:26.163 --> 44:30.167
I don't want to be with Griffin.
I want to be him.

44:31.168 --> 44:32.836
I want to do what he does.

44:33.629 --> 44:36.840
And that's not love,
and it's not fair to either one of us.

44:36.924 --> 44:41.887
You know what I see?
I see a spoiled, arrogant little girl.

44:41.970 --> 44:42.970
I'm arrogant?

44:43.013 --> 44:45.015
After everything I went through
with your father...

44:45.099 --> 44:47.226
- Oh, God.
- ...and you finally find a good man,

44:47.309 --> 44:50.270
- a goddamn hero...
- Don't you dare bring Dad into this!

44:50.354 --> 44:52.439
Why not? He's the reason
you always dated losers.

44:52.523 --> 44:53.399
That is bullshit.

44:53.482 --> 44:55.776
And when you finally find a winner,

44:55.859 --> 44:58.821
you crawl back to Max
and blow him for some story...

45:15.504 --> 45:16.672
Mother, wait...

45:51.957 --> 45:53.250
Detective Costa.

45:53.542 --> 45:54.585
Hey, Jones here.

45:54.668 --> 45:56.086
You got something?

45:56.170 --> 45:58.714
Well, I know
who didn't kill Luanne McClure.

45:58.797 --> 46:00.632
Is that supposed to be helpful?

46:00.716 --> 46:03.260
She was a nurse, killed ten years ago.

46:03.343 --> 46:05.971
A guy named Dave Kawecki
is locked up for it.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.723
But?

46:07.806 --> 46:10.726
You can add her
to our killer's body count.

46:10.809 --> 46:11.810
How do you know this?

46:11.894 --> 46:14.104
I'm just helpfully telling you
what I can confirm.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.186
Fun fact.

46:54.269 --> 46:55.687
When an octopus is attacked,

46:55.771 --> 46:58.774
it ditches its wounded arm
and just swims away.

47:02.236 --> 47:05.697
It's better to let things go
before they drag you under.

47:50.534 --> 47:53.870
The killer and I are like
two solitary animals

47:53.954 --> 47:55.789
circling each other in a tank.

47:56.915 --> 48:03.171
Two creatures, out of nowhere,
unconnected to anything...

48:04.089 --> 48:05.090
de novo.

49:04.524 --> 49:07.986
Jessica, you're all right.

49:18.664 --> 49:19.790
My lady...

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
You get lost?

49:23.043 --> 49:25.212
- I didn't know where you were.
- Stay close.

49:25.295 --> 49:26.546
I was worried.

49:26.630 --> 49:27.631
Excuse me.

49:54.866 --> 49:55.867
Jessica...

50:02.124 --> 50:04.543
Please exit the aquarium immediately...

50:08.463 --> 50:10.924
Please exit the aquarium immediately...

50:14.761 --> 50:17.139
Please exit the aquarium immediately...

50:17.556 --> 50:19.141
Help us! Please!
