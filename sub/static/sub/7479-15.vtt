00:01.035 --> 00:03.526
Previously on NCIS: Los Angeles:

00:03.771 --> 00:07.298
When I was a kid, a man
at a beach handed me a toy soldier.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.500
A message from your past?

00:09.710 --> 00:12.338
Moe? They killed Moe.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.046
- Where's Callen?
- Temporarily unavailable.

02:46.974 --> 02:48.965
I'm sorry I wasn't there
to help you with Moe.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.798
Yeah? That makes two of us.

02:51.972 --> 02:52.996
Three, if you count Moe

02:53.174 --> 02:56.041
but he's not feeling much of anything
because he's dead.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.073
You may like working alone,
but I don't.

02:59.246 --> 03:02.647
There's a reason why
SEALs operate in teams, it works.

03:02.816 --> 03:06.013
It protects you, it protects your partner,
it protects the mission.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.745
I know.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.219
We will get them, Sam,
I promise you that.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.484
Oh, yeah? When?

03:13.561 --> 03:16.257
And when the hell are you planning
on coming back to work?

03:16.463 --> 03:17.589
I was expecting to see you.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.699
We were supposed
to be riding on this together.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.732
Instead, I'm out here all alone.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.529
I'm juggling a dozen cases.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.071
He broke into my house.

03:31.612 --> 03:34.206
No ID and he's not talking.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.747
Not English, anyway.

03:41.855 --> 03:45.222
Someone left this on my sister's grave
three days ago.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.190
I remember a guy
giving this to me as a kid.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.127
You think they're connected?

03:50.864 --> 03:53.094
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.132
I even called her to apologize,
all right? Twice.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.704
Too little, too late. You lied to her.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.641
Uh, no. No, I did not.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.371
Excuse me.
Lies of omission are still lies.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.952
I didn't tell her because I didn't think
it was gonna be a big deal.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.916
You went out
with one of her girlfriends.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.654
For drinks, all right?
And it was her friend's idea.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.226
I was just being polite.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.259
So you wouldn't have slept
with her friend?

04:23.464 --> 04:24.795
No.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.294
Okay, maybe.

04:27.534 --> 04:31.595
But just to be polite, you know,
because I'm a hopeless romantic.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.968
To me, you're just hopeless.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.110
Oh, what?

04:40.281 --> 04:42.340
No way, no way.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.483
Are you kidding me?

04:47.354 --> 04:48.548
Hey, buddy.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.154
Are you working undercover
as Highway Patrol?

04:51.358 --> 04:54.589
Supposed to be. With Callen.

04:54.795 --> 04:55.853
Where is he?

04:56.497 --> 04:57.862
He's on his way in.

04:58.766 --> 04:59.824
How are you doing?

05:00.501 --> 05:01.525
I'm doing.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.170
Dude, I grew up on CHiPs.
I mean, I wanted to be Ponch.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.431
This right here
is half the reason I became a cop.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.198
You became a cop
because of a TV show?

05:08.442 --> 05:11.605
Not just one TV show,
T.J. Hooker, hello?

05:11.779 --> 05:14.111
Seriously, you guys
have to let me ride with you on this.

05:14.281 --> 05:16.476
It's a two-man op.
It's supposed to be.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.447
Besides, you don't look like a cop.

05:19.019 --> 05:22.352
Okay, that's on purpose.
All this is so I can work undercover.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.614
As what, Shaggy from Scooby-Doo?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.821
Oh, my God,
you do look like Shaggy.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.019
All right.

05:29.196 --> 05:33.394
And this has been put on hold.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.296
Somebody broke
into Callen's house last night.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.403
- What?
- They steal anything?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.540
He's got nothing to steal.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.639
Where are we?

05:47.815 --> 05:49.976
No luck with facial
or fingerprint identification.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.845
This guy's a ghost.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.849
Where is our phantom
at the moment?

05:54.054 --> 05:55.419
He's secured in the boat shed.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.351
He say anything?

05:57.524 --> 06:00.186
Rewind the interrogation tape,
will you, Eric?

06:10.170 --> 06:13.537
It sounds
like a Romani dialect to me.

06:13.741 --> 06:17.074
Yeah, Hetty's right.
I hear a strong Balkan influence.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.246
I can send this to Washington,
try to get it translated.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.882
No need.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.517
There's only one guy I know
that employs gypsies.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.744
He's also the only person

06:26.954 --> 06:29.388
who might have known
to look for me in that house.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.854
- Arkady.
- Who's Arkady?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.924
Arkady Kolcheck, former KGB.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.227
A friend of Callen's.

06:37.231 --> 06:41.429
Why would he send someone
to come after you if he's your friend?

06:43.070 --> 06:45.095
Good question.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.983
Arkady, I didn't see him.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.455
Sorry, boss.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.993
I see you got my message.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.565
You couldn't have left a note?

07:15.769 --> 07:18.135
You couldn't have rang the buzzer?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.163
Nice work.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.308
Get him cleaned up.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.407
Let's go.

07:27.514 --> 07:28.708
Here's your boy's gun.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.010
I needed to find you.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.917
I sent Niko
to see if you were living there.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.358
You look well.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.860
Toy soldier?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.830
- Supposed to mean something to me?
- Does it?

07:50.370 --> 07:53.100
Maybe if I was 8.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.638
You know this man?

08:00.781 --> 08:02.305
Rameesh Nayam-Singh.

08:02.516 --> 08:05.542
Yeah, I've heard of him.
He's a, uh, Indian philanthropist.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.617
You should take a closer look
at the countries

08:07.788 --> 08:09.517
where he does his charity work.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.383
His black market operations
overseas

08:11.558 --> 08:14.789
are bigger
than any of his legitimate businesses.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.360
I don't see how this affects me.

08:16.864 --> 08:20.994
Singh is trying
to move his illegal operations here.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.329
In fact, there is rumor

08:23.504 --> 08:26.234
he is smuggling a shipment
of counterfeit computer chips

08:26.406 --> 08:28.567
worth millions of dollars
in a few days.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.805
Next time call the FBI.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.707
I hear they got a hotline
for that sort of thing.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.214
I also came across this.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.388
Hey.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.331
One of my men found it on someone
who is trying to infiltrate my operations.

08:57.504 --> 08:58.698
Where is this someone now?

09:00.607 --> 09:02.575
- Who took this photo?
- I'm trying to find out.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.176
It could take a couple of days.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.505
Probably have an answer for you
right around the time

09:06.680 --> 09:08.170
that Singh's been arrested.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.614
Are you trying to blackmail me?

09:12.853 --> 09:16.118
I'm hurt you would even
consider such a thing.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.348
Don't send anybody else
to my house.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.885
Not unless
you wanna get rid of them.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.326
We'll be in touch, old friend.

09:40.345 --> 09:45.044
Rameesh Nayam-Singh
is a slumdog billionaire, literally.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.309
He's an orphan who grew up
on the streets of Mumbai

09:47.485 --> 09:49.612
and within a few short years
built an empire

09:49.788 --> 09:51.449
in tech support and call centres.

09:51.656 --> 09:54.147
Most recently,
he's expanded into IT security

09:54.359 --> 09:56.384
with huge overseas contracts.

09:56.595 --> 09:59.996
He's also given millions of dollars
to his various refugee charities

10:00.599 --> 10:03.227
in Chad, Somalia,
Sudan, Afghanistan.

10:03.435 --> 10:05.232
Every single one
in a war-torn country.

10:05.804 --> 10:07.795
That's where you tend
to find refugees.

10:14.279 --> 10:16.611
All these countries
are in unstable areas

10:16.781 --> 10:20.273
where there's big money to be made
if you're in right business, big money.

10:20.485 --> 10:21.782
There had been rumors

10:21.953 --> 10:24.478
of black market dealings
and subsequent investigations,

10:24.656 --> 10:26.681
but no one has
linked him to anything shady.

10:26.891 --> 10:30.418
Singh also owns the Kress
nightclub along with about six others.

10:30.629 --> 10:33.154
Every time he can't get into a club,
he buys it.

10:33.331 --> 10:35.390
Yeah, and according
to several magazine articles,

10:35.600 --> 10:37.465
he is quite the playboy.

10:38.603 --> 10:39.627
He's kind of cute.

10:39.804 --> 10:43.262
It's funny how much sexier a couple
of billion dollars makes a guy, huh?

10:43.441 --> 10:47.969
Supposedly, Singh's got impenetrable
security due to a healthy paranoia.

10:48.179 --> 10:50.545
He's also extremely superstitious,

10:50.782 --> 10:52.807
relying on astrology
and other esoteric means

10:52.984 --> 10:56.147
to pick his staff and
make important business decisions.

10:56.554 --> 10:59.421
I can appreciate that.
Big fan of the Magic 8 Ball myself.

10:59.624 --> 11:04.027
Unconventional targets
require unconventional methods.

11:09.634 --> 11:12.535
Gonna need some nightclub attire
and some petty cash.

11:13.438 --> 11:15.531
And what op would this be?

11:15.740 --> 11:16.968
Need to check out a tip.

11:17.509 --> 11:18.703
From Arkady.

11:20.211 --> 11:22.475
And this tip concerns us how?

11:22.681 --> 11:25.946
Rameesh Nayam-Singh is supposedly
dealing in counterfeit computer chips.

11:27.986 --> 11:30.250
If a substandard chip were to make it
into an airliner

11:30.455 --> 11:31.979
or in one
of our nuclear submarines...

11:32.190 --> 11:33.384
Aha.

11:33.558 --> 11:35.185
And would it be safe to assume

11:35.360 --> 11:40.696
that Nayam-Singh is a business rival
of Arkady Kolcheck?

11:41.466 --> 11:42.524
Possibly.

11:42.734 --> 11:46.397
And this doesn't present itself
as a conflict of interest to you?

11:47.972 --> 11:51.430
How one gets one's information
is often as important

11:51.609 --> 11:55.010
as the information one gets,
Mr. Callen.

11:55.547 --> 11:57.538
I'm just running down a tip, Hetty.

11:57.749 --> 11:59.239
Run quickly.

12:21.873 --> 12:24.239
I gotta get out more.

12:35.053 --> 12:36.418
I got Singh.

12:36.955 --> 12:38.388
VIP section.

12:38.556 --> 12:40.148
What if he's not interested in me?

12:40.391 --> 12:42.222
Well,
then we know he's probably gay.

12:43.027 --> 12:45.587
Is that some kind
of weird compliment, Deeks?

12:46.664 --> 12:48.529
Yes.

12:48.733 --> 12:50.064
No. I don't know.

12:50.235 --> 12:52.260
- Forget about it, you're like my sister.
- Oh!

12:52.437 --> 12:54.598
Now it's just getting creepy.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.742
Well, I do like the Appalachians.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.854
Time to bait the hook, boys.

13:22.433 --> 13:24.333
- Can I get a mojito, please?
- Yep.

13:25.336 --> 13:26.701
Yo.

13:26.871 --> 13:28.634
Listen, I'm so sorry
to bother you again.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.967
Wondered if you could read
my buddy's fortune quick?

13:31.142 --> 13:33.201
I'm just trying to enjoy my drink,
okay?

13:33.444 --> 13:35.378
Oh come on,
please, please, please?

13:36.481 --> 13:38.676
Okay, give me your hand.

13:38.883 --> 13:40.441
I'm telling you, she's good.

13:41.219 --> 13:43.710
You spend most of your time alone.

13:43.955 --> 13:46.480
Have friends who love you
but you keep them at arm's length.

13:46.691 --> 13:51.492
Your life has many secrets,
some that even you don't know.

13:52.497 --> 13:55.364
You love kittens,
long walks in the rain...

13:56.301 --> 13:59.828
- And Barry Manilow.
- It's amazing.

14:00.038 --> 14:01.972
Seriously,
even got the Manilow part.

14:02.507 --> 14:03.838
I told you she was the best.

14:04.042 --> 14:06.169
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No, I'm okay, thank you.

14:06.377 --> 14:09.005
- No, we insist.
- No, seriously, I'm fine, please.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.671
I think the lady has made herself
quite clear, gentlemen.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.978
Perhaps you would like a table
in the VIP area?

14:15.153 --> 14:16.711
Mindy, take care of them.

14:16.888 --> 14:17.980
- All right.
- Thanks, man.

14:18.156 --> 14:19.919
I could use a little VIP treatment.

14:20.124 --> 14:22.922
- Party in the VIP section, baby.
- I am Rameesh Nayam-Singh.

14:23.127 --> 14:24.151
Welcome to my club.

14:24.362 --> 14:27.354
Hi. And thank you.
My name is Esme.

14:27.565 --> 14:28.862
Hey, we're all set.

14:29.067 --> 14:31.695
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much, Mindy.

14:32.770 --> 14:35.534
I noticed you talking to that
gentleman, telling his fortune.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.867
He seemed quite impressed, Esme.

14:38.042 --> 14:39.873
Would I be out of line if I asked?

14:40.511 --> 14:43.912
Well, it's gonna be a little hard in here
with all the noise and music, but, um,

14:45.149 --> 14:46.776
- I suppose I owe you one.
- Great.

14:47.018 --> 14:48.679
Let's see.

14:48.853 --> 14:51.413
- Ready, Eric?
- Ready, willing and able.

14:51.589 --> 14:54.251
- Nell?
- Let's start with something easy.

14:54.459 --> 14:57.223
He spent some time at the
Pardesh Orphanage as a young boy.

14:57.428 --> 15:00.454
Looks like he was close to
a nun there named Sister Vimala.

15:00.665 --> 15:02.633
She died just last year.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.462
You lost your parents
at a young age.

15:06.170 --> 15:10.402
Your life was hard,
but there were saints along the way.

15:10.575 --> 15:12.042
Um...

15:12.777 --> 15:17.578
I see a sister or a woman?

15:17.749 --> 15:20.115
Violet. Um...

15:20.318 --> 15:22.183
Villa?

15:22.921 --> 15:26.789
She's gone now,
but, uh, she watches over you.

15:28.126 --> 15:30.993
Three months ago,
Singh suffered a minor injury

15:31.229 --> 15:34.892
in Cote d'Ivoire, Africa
when a truck he was riding in flipped.

15:35.066 --> 15:36.727
You travel a lot.

15:38.603 --> 15:40.468
Those travels can be dangerous.

15:40.638 --> 15:42.936
You were injured recently? Uh...

15:43.308 --> 15:46.573
Something to do with ivory?

15:47.979 --> 15:50.743
I am more interested
in what is yet to happen.

15:50.915 --> 15:53.975
Do you see a woman in my life?
Is there love in my future?

15:55.486 --> 15:56.783
Maybe.

15:56.955 --> 15:58.479
Only maybe?

15:58.723 --> 16:00.623
Now, this over here is...

16:00.825 --> 16:05.626
Well, well, well, if it ain't
two-faced Jimmy the Weasel.

16:06.331 --> 16:08.663
Little Keen. It's been a while.

16:08.833 --> 16:11.495
Yeah, been a while
in jail because of you, Jimmy.

16:11.669 --> 16:15.298
That's funny because I don't remember
telling you to rob that bank.

16:15.473 --> 16:17.441
It's good seeing you, Keen.

16:18.843 --> 16:20.834
Deeks has some
unwanted company.

16:21.012 --> 16:22.673
I'm on it.

16:25.516 --> 16:27.950
Kensi, be ready to move.

16:28.119 --> 16:29.950
I think you are teasing me now.

16:30.154 --> 16:31.678
Please, tell me more.

16:32.256 --> 16:35.123
You know, 61 percent of all felons
are repeat offenders.

16:35.293 --> 16:37.625
You know that, Jimmy?
They taught me that in jail.

16:37.829 --> 16:39.990
You learned something, right?
It wasn't a total waste.

16:40.198 --> 16:43.565
- Now, I'm probably going back.
- Probably.

16:43.801 --> 16:47.737
But when I do, I'm going back a hero
for having turned a cop inside out.

16:47.905 --> 16:50.203
Just a second, I just want
to introduce you to somebody.

16:50.375 --> 16:51.706
He's a friend of mine.

16:51.876 --> 16:53.537
- What's up?
- What's up?

16:53.778 --> 16:57.805
Heh, heh. Yeah, I should have known,
you don't fight your own battles.

16:57.982 --> 16:59.711
Yo, Shorty. Baby D.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.545
Shorty and Baby D?

17:04.722 --> 17:08.419
Am I the only one that's reveling
in the irony of these nicknames?

17:09.292 --> 17:11.056
Apparently so.

17:11.229 --> 17:14.289
- Time to go, Kensi.
- I'm sorry.

17:14.665 --> 17:17.724
I have to leave
before the trouble starts.

17:17.902 --> 17:19.335
What trouble?

17:21.506 --> 17:22.700
There you go.

17:25.742 --> 17:28.233
Oh, no. Security.

17:28.445 --> 17:29.936
- Break it up.
- That's enough.

17:30.114 --> 17:31.911
I didn't start this, man.

17:32.083 --> 17:35.075
Easy on the leather, man,
easy on the leather.

17:35.319 --> 17:37.014
Hey, easy, bro. Easy, man.

17:37.188 --> 17:39.588
- Let's go home.
- Yeah.

17:54.372 --> 17:56.567
This club sucks.

18:10.353 --> 18:11.650
Singh try to contact you yet?

18:12.255 --> 18:13.313
No.

18:13.523 --> 18:15.753
Can't say I blame him
after the stunt Deeks pulled.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.888
- That could have happened to anyone.
- Yeah, but it didn't.

18:20.096 --> 18:21.188
You should be thanking me.

18:21.364 --> 18:23.696
I stage dove those bouncers
so you, my friend,

18:23.866 --> 18:24.890
can make a clean getaway.

18:25.101 --> 18:27.899
The day I need your help, Deeks,
is the day I hang up my gun.

18:28.104 --> 18:30.732
Oh, yeah, because there's actually
this little hook right here

18:30.907 --> 18:33.273
- next to my desk if you want...
- Guys, come on.

18:33.476 --> 18:35.910
I know you're trying to rile me,
but I won't be riled.

18:36.112 --> 18:37.545
- You want a hug?
- Deeks.

18:37.714 --> 18:38.976
What?

18:39.182 --> 18:43.050
You see what happens
when you pull away from your team.

18:43.519 --> 18:44.884
My team?

18:45.788 --> 18:49.280
I didn't hire Deeks,
or any of them for that matter.

18:49.525 --> 18:53.518
No, if I left the hiring up to you,
you'd be the only person working here.

18:53.730 --> 18:55.755
You saying I don't play well
with others, Hetty?

18:55.998 --> 18:58.592
I'm suggesting that your default

18:58.768 --> 19:01.931
is to go it alone
when you may be needing them most.

19:02.138 --> 19:06.438
I like to think that I impart
a certain wisdom and skill set

19:06.642 --> 19:09.736
to those
who pass through these doors.

19:09.946 --> 19:13.313
The one wish I have for you,
Mr. Callen,

19:13.549 --> 19:15.574
is that by the time you leave here,

19:15.752 --> 19:18.915
you've learned the art
of trusting others.

19:19.422 --> 19:22.152
In your personal life
as well as at work.

19:23.826 --> 19:25.123
Yes, Nell?

19:25.895 --> 19:30.025
Oh. Yeah, um...
Were you looking for me?

19:30.233 --> 19:32.793
- No.
- I was.

19:32.969 --> 19:34.766
Excuse me.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.307
Is she still watching us?

19:39.475 --> 19:41.466
Uh, yep.

19:44.981 --> 19:46.005
Did you find anything?

19:46.182 --> 19:50.243
Well, no hair or fiber to speak of
on the photo which is not unusual.

19:50.419 --> 19:52.250
And the ink and paper
can be bought anywhere.

19:52.455 --> 19:55.481
But I was able to pull
several partial prints off of it.

19:55.658 --> 19:57.819
I got a hit off of IAFIS for this guy.

19:58.060 --> 19:59.493
Name is Dobrashin Garasovic.

19:59.662 --> 20:02.324
He's a Serbian national
and goes by the nickname "Senka,"

20:02.498 --> 20:03.522
which means "shadow."

20:03.699 --> 20:04.961
So he moves around a lot,

20:05.134 --> 20:07.830
which made it difficult to find
his last known place of residence.

20:08.004 --> 20:12.202
And I'm not even sure if the one I got is
still valid, but I sent it to your phone.

20:12.441 --> 20:14.705
- Nice work, Nell.
- Hmm. Thanks.

20:15.311 --> 20:17.711
Deeks, because of you
we have to find a new way to Singh.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.780
That's good
because the last plan was lame.

20:19.982 --> 20:22.143
How is he gonna fall for
Kensi's fortune-telling?

20:23.519 --> 20:24.850
- No offense.
- Hello?

20:25.021 --> 20:28.548
The former Prime Minister of India
used to consult astrologers and gurus

20:28.724 --> 20:31.215
and he wore a magical chain
around his neck to ward off evil.

20:31.394 --> 20:33.021
Hell, I had to face a Liberian warlord

20:33.196 --> 20:35.027
who used to partake
in human sacrifices

20:35.198 --> 20:36.222
then go into battle naked

20:36.399 --> 20:38.867
because he didn't believe
American bullets could hurt him.

20:39.101 --> 20:40.398
I had an uncle like that.

20:40.636 --> 20:41.967
No doubt.

20:42.138 --> 20:44.572
- Yeah, sounds great.
- Fantastic.

20:44.740 --> 20:46.537
- I will be there, Gladstone's.
- Great.

20:46.742 --> 20:48.801
- Okay, bye-bye.
- All right, goodbye.

20:48.978 --> 20:51.879
That was Rameesh Nayam-Singh
calling my undercover number.

20:52.048 --> 20:53.379
He's invited Esme for lunch.

20:53.549 --> 20:55.983
Looks like he tracked me down
from my credit-card receipt.

20:56.185 --> 20:58.176
Hopefully,
Eric's backstopping holds up.

20:58.387 --> 21:00.981
- How do you wanna play it?
- Your call.

21:01.858 --> 21:05.191
I gotta run something down, but
I'll hook back with you when I'm done.

21:24.247 --> 21:25.509
Hello again.

21:28.451 --> 21:30.681
- Please.
- Thank you.

21:30.853 --> 21:32.844
I make out
two guys here with Singh.

21:33.055 --> 21:35.023
Table at your 12 o'clock, my 10.

21:36.259 --> 21:38.124
Turns out you were right last night.

21:38.294 --> 21:40.387
How did you know a fight
would break out at my club

21:40.563 --> 21:41.723
right after you left?

21:41.931 --> 21:44.729
Predicting a fight at a club
is like predicting crying at a wedding.

21:44.901 --> 21:45.959
It's not that impressive.

21:46.168 --> 21:48.068
So tell me something that is.

21:48.871 --> 21:50.634
You're not here alone.

21:50.806 --> 21:52.899
I sense the presence of others.

21:53.109 --> 21:54.872
I know some things about you too.

21:55.778 --> 21:59.805
You have been using your abilities for
some less than admirable intentions.

21:59.982 --> 22:01.711
Several charges of insider trading

22:01.884 --> 22:05.945
and, apparently, you're not allowed
to set foot in Las Vegas.

22:06.122 --> 22:08.955
- I'm sorry, this is not gonna work.
- Oh, wait, please, I'm sorry.

22:09.125 --> 22:10.592
I'm not judging you.

22:10.793 --> 22:13.557
I find it amusing at best
and quite intriguing.

22:13.763 --> 22:15.754
It's part of the reason
I've asked you here.

22:15.932 --> 22:17.559
Please.

22:21.938 --> 22:25.066
And you're right, I'm not alone.

22:25.508 --> 22:27.840
I travel with some assistants,
that's all.

22:29.078 --> 22:30.340
Relationships are hard for me

22:30.513 --> 22:32.344
because I know
when people are lying to me.

22:32.581 --> 22:35.141
I haven't lied to you yet, have I?

22:35.318 --> 22:37.752
In fact,
most people think I'm a good guy.

22:38.220 --> 22:39.619
A humanitarian even.

22:39.789 --> 22:41.484
Well, then this is never
gonna work out

22:41.657 --> 22:44.353
because I've never had luck
with nice guys.

22:45.127 --> 22:48.756
I said people think I'm a good guy.
I didn't say I was one.

23:30.506 --> 23:34.567
You, me, everyone has their secrets.
But I guess you know that.

23:35.177 --> 23:38.578
I can only see into a person's future
as far as they're willing to trust me.

23:39.415 --> 23:43.852
I have an associate, a gypsy
who claims to have the gift as well.

23:44.020 --> 23:45.419
You should meet him.

23:47.156 --> 23:48.987
Niko.

23:49.158 --> 23:51.319
This is Esme.

23:51.827 --> 23:53.294
Oh, man.

23:53.496 --> 23:54.895
You seeing this, Sam?

23:55.097 --> 23:56.223
I got him.

23:56.432 --> 23:59.595
- Thought that guy worked for Arkady.
- So does Callen.

23:59.802 --> 24:01.895
Eric, conference G in on this line.

24:02.104 --> 24:03.696
On it, Sam.

24:16.852 --> 24:19.320
- Callen.
- G, we got a situation here.

24:19.522 --> 24:22.855
The guy Arkady sent to break into
your place is having lunch with Singh.

24:35.204 --> 24:36.569
You hearing me, G?

24:36.739 --> 24:38.639
Yeah, I hear you.

24:48.716 --> 24:52.413
You know most people think
that gypsies come from Egypt.

24:52.954 --> 24:55.388
That's where the name comes
from originally, Egyptians.

24:55.557 --> 24:59.118
But the truth is
they came from India.

24:59.294 --> 25:01.762
Isn't that right, Niko?

25:01.930 --> 25:03.397
So they say.

25:03.598 --> 25:05.429
But we prefer to be called Roma.

25:05.934 --> 25:07.128
She's gadjo.

25:09.070 --> 25:11.368
How long are you gonna let
History Channel go on here?

25:11.573 --> 25:13.632
Relax, Deeks.

25:13.808 --> 25:16.902
Niko never saw or heard Kensi.
We let it play out.

25:17.112 --> 25:18.409
Sam's right.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.980
If she felt threatened,
Kensi'd get up and leave.

25:21.149 --> 25:23.379
- Eric, you on the line?
- Yeah, I'm here.

25:23.585 --> 25:25.951
Send a forensics team
to this address.

25:26.154 --> 25:28.179
Dig up everything you can
on Dobrashin Garasovic.

25:28.423 --> 25:31.256
I want his phone,
Internet, travel, the works.

25:31.426 --> 25:32.450
Oh, and tell Nell,

25:32.627 --> 25:34.595
I'm sending her a tattoo
I want her to identify.

25:34.796 --> 25:36.661
You got it.

25:42.337 --> 25:44.328
- Sam?
- Yeah.

25:44.506 --> 25:46.269
I think it's time we turn up the heat.

25:46.441 --> 25:48.170
Tell Kensi to burn Niko.

25:48.343 --> 25:50.140
Force him to show his hand.

25:52.914 --> 25:54.711
She heard you.

25:55.183 --> 25:57.447
She's tougher than she looks.

25:57.652 --> 25:58.710
Maybe even ex-military.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.787
Oh, my God.

26:01.956 --> 26:03.890
The closest thing to the military
I've ever been

26:04.058 --> 26:05.650
was the Old Navy store.

26:06.027 --> 26:08.222
- She is lying.
- No, I'm not.

26:08.463 --> 26:09.725
But you are.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.495
You're not the only man
he works for.

26:14.702 --> 26:16.863
I can see someone else.

26:17.071 --> 26:18.732
Older.

26:19.340 --> 26:21.001
Foreign.

26:22.143 --> 26:24.873
Ukrainian, no.

26:25.213 --> 26:27.044
Russian.

26:27.315 --> 26:30.876
I see initials, A...

26:31.152 --> 26:33.552
K. Like the gun.

26:35.723 --> 26:37.987
- You see, you see?
- Ha-ha-ha.

26:38.159 --> 26:40.423
Damn, she's good.

26:40.595 --> 26:41.721
You're absolutely right.

26:42.463 --> 26:46.422
He works for a man with those initials.
Or at least he pretends to.

26:46.601 --> 26:48.501
Sounds like Arkady's getting played.

26:48.670 --> 26:50.365
Which means we're getting played.

26:50.572 --> 26:52.335
I think we can
help each other out, Esme.

26:53.575 --> 26:55.236
Come to my club this afternoon

26:55.410 --> 26:57.742
and we can discuss
a business arrangement.

26:57.979 --> 27:00.277
I might just do that.

27:01.382 --> 27:03.111
Excuse me.

27:06.721 --> 27:08.586
You're making a mistake.

27:08.790 --> 27:11.918
A man can make many mistakes
with a woman like that.

27:12.126 --> 27:13.286
I don't trust her.

27:14.362 --> 27:17.092
You don't get paid
to trust people, Niko.

27:20.735 --> 27:22.600
Singh's on the move.

27:23.137 --> 27:24.229
Got him.

27:51.666 --> 27:52.758
Don't move.

27:52.934 --> 27:54.094
Don't move.

27:54.269 --> 27:55.463
Turn over.

27:55.937 --> 27:57.598
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

28:03.778 --> 28:05.609
- Who's this guy?
- Niko's friend.

28:05.780 --> 28:07.577
I've got a cell phone here.

28:16.291 --> 28:17.349
Hello?

28:17.558 --> 28:20.618
I'm sending you a SIM card
that belong to a friend of Niko's.

28:20.795 --> 28:23.059
- Have Eric see what he can get off it.
- Will do.

28:23.264 --> 28:26.461
Oh, and I got some
information on that thing you sent me.

28:26.668 --> 28:28.932
- The tattoo?
- Yeah, that's the one.

28:29.137 --> 28:31.196
It's the 16-spoke wheel
of the Hindu Chakra

28:31.372 --> 28:33.169
which is the same symbol
used by the Romani.

28:33.341 --> 28:34.774
It represents the vardo

28:34.942 --> 28:37.308
or the wagon wheels
of their traditional caravans.

28:37.512 --> 28:39.139
Garasovic was Romani?

28:39.347 --> 28:41.144
Just like Niko.

28:41.316 --> 28:43.648
Nell, you don't have to whisper.

28:43.818 --> 28:46.844
Right, well, maybe I don't have to,
but I would prefer to,

28:47.021 --> 28:48.454
if that's okay with you.

28:48.623 --> 28:50.784
Not that I don't respect your authority,
Agent Callen,

28:50.958 --> 28:52.892
it's just that,
I think it's in my best interest

28:53.094 --> 28:54.652
not to get on Hetty's bad side.

28:54.862 --> 28:56.523
Too late, dear.

28:58.166 --> 29:01.226
Forensics confirms Niko's prints
at Dobrashin Garasovic's house.

29:01.402 --> 29:04.803
So why would Niko kill Garasovic
if they're both working for Singh?

29:05.006 --> 29:08.203
More importantly, why would he have
that guy try to kill me?

29:08.409 --> 29:10.206
He obviously thought
you were a threat.

29:10.411 --> 29:12.675
- To his job?
- Or his plans.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.370
If Niko is trying to sell out Arkady,

29:14.549 --> 29:16.710
he might be trying
to sell out Singh as well.

29:16.918 --> 29:19.648
Garasovic might have figured it out,
so Niko had to kill him.

29:19.821 --> 29:21.584
Do you really think
Niko has the connections

29:21.756 --> 29:23.519
to fence computer chips?

29:23.691 --> 29:25.522
- Hello?
- Hey, Eric.

29:25.727 --> 29:28.992
So I accessed this guy's SIM card.

29:29.163 --> 29:31.188
Most of the numbers he called
were burn phones

29:31.366 --> 29:32.628
so that's a dead end.

29:33.267 --> 29:34.894
He also sent
a bunch of text messages

29:35.069 --> 29:37.560
but they're too brief
and too cryptic to be of much use.

29:37.772 --> 29:41.902
However, he sent the same text
to several different phones today.

29:42.076 --> 29:44.169
There's an address and a time.

29:44.345 --> 29:48.076
It's 3900 West Manchester Boulevard,
Inglewood.

29:48.282 --> 29:50.011
That's gotta be near the L.A. Forum.

29:50.218 --> 29:51.276
That is the Forum.

29:51.519 --> 29:53.680
Boom, didn't even need MapQuest.

29:53.855 --> 29:57.291
At 1600 hours.
We have got less than an hour.

29:57.525 --> 29:59.049
Did you trace those phones, Eric?

29:59.227 --> 30:02.685
This is where they were at the time
that they received the text.

30:02.864 --> 30:06.561
Which they, in turn,
sent to several other cell phones.

30:06.768 --> 30:08.429
Like they're concentrating
in three areas.

30:08.603 --> 30:10.594
That's Hollywood, Beverly Hills
and the Valley.

30:10.805 --> 30:12.136
Or three different groups.

30:12.306 --> 30:16.265
Singh, Arkady and Niko, all of whom
have the same information.

30:16.444 --> 30:17.934
Can you show me
where the phones are?

30:18.112 --> 30:19.545
Yup.

30:21.282 --> 30:23.614
Two of the three groups
are headed to the Forum.

30:23.785 --> 30:25.650
Which is where
Singh is getting his delivery.

30:25.820 --> 30:28.550
Great. Three heavily armed
groups converging,

30:28.723 --> 30:31.487
two of which are planning to kill
everyone and steal those chips.

30:31.726 --> 30:33.318
Why we need to divide and conquer.

30:34.262 --> 30:36.253
If you can convince Singh
to cancel his shipment

30:36.431 --> 30:39.093
or to change location,
we'll eliminate one of the players.

30:39.300 --> 30:42.497
Okay, well, that still leaves Arkady
and Niko's paramilitary group.

30:42.737 --> 30:43.761
I'll deal with Arkady.

30:43.938 --> 30:47.271
If I warn him what's happening, Niko's
boys will show up to an empty Forum.

30:47.475 --> 30:48.806
We'll avoid a bloodbath.

30:52.713 --> 30:54.840
Nell, what are you doing here?
You have to call first.

30:55.016 --> 30:59.146
- This is how you get yourself killed.
- Well, you'd be doing me a favor.

30:59.954 --> 31:06.223
Well, aren't you a cozy bunch
in your secret little hideout?

31:06.427 --> 31:09.021
Hetty, what are you doing here?

31:09.263 --> 31:11.823
You know damn well
what I'm doing here, Mr. Callen.

31:11.999 --> 31:14.433
I'm shutting you down.

31:25.236 --> 31:28.467
We call it intelligence
for a reason, Mr. Callen.

31:28.647 --> 31:31.912
Which is why you're going to provide
full disclosure

31:32.084 --> 31:34.518
before we go one step further.

31:34.687 --> 31:35.881
There's no time for that.

31:36.055 --> 31:38.546
If we don't act on this now,
we're gonna have a minor war.

31:38.757 --> 31:42.318
Never mistake recklessness
for bravery.

31:42.494 --> 31:44.758
I'm not. Hetty,
you're asking me to trust, okay?

31:44.963 --> 31:45.987
I am.

31:46.165 --> 31:49.362
I'm trusting Kensi to convince Singh
to either cancel or move the shipment

31:49.568 --> 31:51.832
and I'm trusting Sam and Deeks
to watch her back.

31:52.037 --> 31:54.335
And I'm asking you
to trust me to deal with Arkady.

31:55.340 --> 31:56.398
Alone?

31:56.608 --> 31:57.768
Your team is not here

31:57.976 --> 31:59.876
because of computer chips,
Mr. Callen.

32:00.045 --> 32:02.570
They're here because of you.

32:02.981 --> 32:05.506
Last time you went off
the reservation, G, without me,

32:05.684 --> 32:07.015
I lost someone I cared about.

32:07.186 --> 32:09.211
That's not gonna happen this time.

32:12.357 --> 32:13.722
Trust me.

32:21.567 --> 32:23.535
Esme, I was getting worried.

32:23.736 --> 32:24.794
Well, that's a good sign.

32:25.003 --> 32:27.369
It means you sensed it too.

32:27.639 --> 32:31.302
- Niko's betrayed you to the police.
- You're teasing me.

32:34.213 --> 32:36.738
Find Niko now.

32:37.549 --> 32:39.278
I saw him trying to cut a deal.

32:39.651 --> 32:42.779
Trade something valuable of yours
for his freedom. I...

32:44.323 --> 32:46.883
Look, if you trust me and I'm wrong,

32:47.059 --> 32:49.653
then this is inconvenient for you
and it is embarrassing for me.

32:49.828 --> 32:52.456
However, if I'm right...

33:01.840 --> 33:03.603
It seems no one knows where he is.

33:08.947 --> 33:11.415
- Hello?
- Change of plans.

33:11.583 --> 33:13.642
Move the delivery
to the backup location.

33:13.852 --> 33:15.251
- Got it.
- Let's go.

33:15.420 --> 33:16.444
Wait, where are we going?

33:16.655 --> 33:18.486
You're the psychic, you tell me.

33:31.970 --> 33:34.097
Eric,
Kensi's on the move with Singh.

33:34.306 --> 33:35.830
Okay.

33:36.575 --> 33:38.008
We got them.

33:43.949 --> 33:48.010
Okay, these buildings and properties
are all owned or leased by Singh.

33:48.220 --> 33:50.017
Send the list to Callen and Sam

33:50.222 --> 33:53.282
and keep L.A.P.D. Apprised
as we narrow it down.

33:53.458 --> 33:56.655
We're gonna need containment
and backup.

34:01.667 --> 34:03.567
Don't get too close.

34:03.735 --> 34:07.034
- I know how to run a tail, Deeks.
- Okay, well, just fall back a little bit.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.900
We'll fall back to the curb
and kick you out if you don't shut up.

34:11.710 --> 34:13.541
What is your problem?

34:13.712 --> 34:15.475
- Seriously.
- You're my problem.

34:15.647 --> 34:17.239
And the fact
that I have a partner there

34:17.416 --> 34:19.007
on his own while I'm stuck with you.

34:19.184 --> 34:20.378
I'm stuck here with you too

34:20.552 --> 34:23.543
while my partner is trapped in the car
ahead of us with three armed guys.

34:23.755 --> 34:26.188
- Maybe we have the same problem.
- Yeah, well maybe we do.

34:26.391 --> 34:29.053
Okay, then we can agree to agree
on the shared problem thing.

34:29.228 --> 34:30.855
And maybe
we should act like partners

34:31.029 --> 34:34.658
so we can save our partners
so you and I don't have to be partners.

34:34.833 --> 34:37.266
- What?
- Just drive.

34:38.270 --> 34:39.862
Not too close.

34:51.382 --> 34:53.351
Arkady?

35:00.158 --> 35:01.921
Singh's stopping.

35:02.094 --> 35:04.688
It looks like an industrial park.

35:07.866 --> 35:09.697
Open the door.

35:27.119 --> 35:30.088
Buy yourself something sexy, Esme.

35:30.322 --> 35:31.983
Federal agents.

35:33.125 --> 35:34.183
Away from the truck.

35:34.893 --> 35:36.190
Down on the ground, move.

35:37.262 --> 35:39.127
Is that sexy enough for you? Huh?

35:39.298 --> 35:40.697
All the way down.

35:43.635 --> 35:46.763
- How are you doing, partner?
- Much better, thank you.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.101
What do we got?

35:51.610 --> 35:55.512
Hetty, it wasn't computer chips,
it was cash, bags of it.

35:55.714 --> 35:59.241
Do you think Arkady knew it was cash
and not computer chips?

35:59.451 --> 36:01.646
If he did, Callen
could be walking into a firestorm.

36:01.853 --> 36:03.252
Eric, connect me to Callen.

36:04.656 --> 36:06.851
Callen, do you copy?

36:07.426 --> 36:09.155
I've lost contact.

36:38.023 --> 36:39.991
Arkady?

36:43.295 --> 36:45.024
Arkady?

36:46.665 --> 36:49.156
Shipment's not coming.

37:02.981 --> 37:04.312
Why is that?

37:05.050 --> 37:07.484
By now,
Singh's probably been arrested.

37:08.854 --> 37:10.549
The whole thing was a setup.

37:10.789 --> 37:13.781
Niko was playing you
and he was playing Singh.

37:14.426 --> 37:16.394
You're getting sloppy, my old friend.

37:16.595 --> 37:18.825
I'm not the one
getting photographed at cemetery.

37:21.833 --> 37:24.927
There is no way you could tell
where I was in that photograph.

37:25.103 --> 37:29.199
There were other pictures of you
at your sister's grave.

37:30.108 --> 37:32.235
I was curious.

37:32.444 --> 37:34.912
I'm sorry. I know how much
family means to you.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.079
Who was Garasovic working for?

37:37.249 --> 37:39.809
Singh hired him to spy on me.

37:40.018 --> 37:42.213
Perhaps he hired him
to spy on you as well.

37:42.421 --> 37:44.548
I didn't even know Singh
until two days ago.

37:44.723 --> 37:46.623
Then maybe he knew you.

37:46.858 --> 37:48.792
And Garasovic, who knows?

37:48.960 --> 37:50.359
Hey, look.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.292
We have a common enemy
once again.

37:56.735 --> 37:59.260
- Call them off.
- Those aren't my guys, durok.

38:05.844 --> 38:06.868
You know this saying?

38:07.546 --> 38:10.538
"I ran from the wolf
but ran into a bear."

38:10.749 --> 38:12.410
I think we're surrounded by bears.

38:22.427 --> 38:24.418
Agent Callen, can you hear me?

38:25.597 --> 38:27.155
Still nothing.

38:27.399 --> 38:29.367
Mr. Hanna, what's your status?

38:29.568 --> 38:31.433
Driving fast.

38:31.603 --> 38:33.764
Some green lights
would help, Mr. Beale.

38:40.812 --> 38:43.610
- Did you bring anybody else with you?
- No, did you?

38:43.782 --> 38:44.806
Who is the durok now?

38:50.589 --> 38:52.750
- You know what this reminds me of?
- Kosovo.

38:52.924 --> 38:55.518
Yes, and we got out of there alive.

38:56.094 --> 38:59.154
- We surrendered.
- Maybe I'm thinking of Chechnya.

39:06.037 --> 39:08.164
I'm out of bullets
and I know you've got three left.

39:08.406 --> 39:09.668
Four.

39:09.841 --> 39:12.332
- You wouldn't consider giving me one.
- Sure.

39:12.544 --> 39:14.512
How much is it worth to you?

39:38.370 --> 39:39.860
Federal agents, drop your weapon.

39:42.474 --> 39:44.237
Move.

39:55.987 --> 39:57.716
Cut that one close, don't you think?

39:57.956 --> 39:59.836
You're like a wolf
till your butt's on the line.

39:59.991 --> 40:01.481
You expect me
to come to your rescue.

40:01.693 --> 40:03.251
Isn't that what partners do?

40:03.495 --> 40:05.725
You're pushing it, you know that?

40:11.269 --> 40:12.361
Nice shooting, Deeks.

40:12.837 --> 40:14.964
Thanks. You too.

40:18.076 --> 40:20.340
What do you want me
to do with this one?

40:22.681 --> 40:24.410
Let him go.

40:37.495 --> 40:40.020
You're gonna explain this one
to Hetty.

40:40.198 --> 40:42.632
He's more valuable to us
on the street.

40:42.801 --> 40:44.359
Especially now that he owes me one.

40:45.904 --> 40:47.303
I suppose I owe you one too, huh?

40:47.505 --> 40:49.405
Ha. One?

40:49.574 --> 40:50.939
More like 20.

40:51.109 --> 40:53.236
That's just today.
You're lucky I don't keep count.

40:53.445 --> 40:55.538
I'm just lucky you can't count.

41:00.885 --> 41:01.943
Oh, yeah.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.747
Ever think we're gonna be
that happy?

41:03.922 --> 41:06.720
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:06.891 --> 41:08.950
Just not together.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.628
I like what you've done
with the place.

41:51.836 --> 41:54.270
Okay,
now if this is about Arkady, I can...

41:54.439 --> 41:57.169
I would have done
the same thing myself.

41:57.876 --> 42:01.175
No, this is about you, Mr. Callen.

42:02.013 --> 42:04.982
I know
that you are looking for answers.

42:05.183 --> 42:10.519
But the thing about the past
is just that.

42:11.156 --> 42:13.351
It's the past.

42:13.591 --> 42:16.685
Today is what's important.

42:16.895 --> 42:20.831
And I for one am glad you're here.

42:27.038 --> 42:29.370
I brought this for you.

42:34.179 --> 42:36.238
- Did you buy me a plant?
- Ha, ha.

42:36.915 --> 42:38.678
It's an epiphyte.

42:38.883 --> 42:40.874
It's perfect for you.

42:41.052 --> 42:42.644
It doesn't require soil.

42:42.821 --> 42:44.584
You don't need to water it.

42:44.756 --> 42:47.725
It absorbs moisture from the air.

42:47.926 --> 42:55.025
It doesn't even need roots,
but they make it more stable.

42:58.903 --> 43:02.134
Good night, Mr. Callen.

43:03.508 --> 43:05.567
Good night, Hetty.
