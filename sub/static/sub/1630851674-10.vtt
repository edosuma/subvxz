WEBVTT

00:02.785 --> 00:05.309
Previously onSEAL Team...

00:05.353 --> 00:08.138
Put the breach
next to that door!

00:08.182 --> 00:09.357
Keep hammering!

00:09.400 --> 00:10.662
CLAY:
Did you warn the GIGN

00:10.706 --> 00:11.968
about any EOD hazards

00:12.012 --> 00:13.317
in the building
when you told 'em

00:13.361 --> 00:14.492
where to put the wall charge?

00:14.536 --> 00:17.104
There were no EOD hazards
in the building.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.802
Are you sure he's so oblivious
to the mistake that he made?

00:19.845 --> 00:21.369
CLAY: Could be
he smells an ambush.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.240
STELLA: You're not attacking
him. You're trying to help him.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.633
CLAY: Yeah, by telling him
his head's so cracked

00:24.676 --> 00:26.026
he nearly blew up his own team.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.897
You're a prime candidate
for Breacher's Syndrome.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.159
I encourage you to look now,

00:29.203 --> 00:31.683
before the effects
become disastrous.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.511
Soon as the baby comes,
I'm gonna ask

00:33.555 --> 00:35.252
to take a family leave
from Bravo.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.820
-I think my water just broke.
-Hey, we're gonna get you

00:37.863 --> 00:39.169
-to the hospital, okay?
-Okay.

00:39.213 --> 00:40.649
Hey, Sonny, why don't you
go check in with Hannah

00:40.692 --> 00:42.259
-and give our ears a break?
-I haven't touched base

00:42.303 --> 00:43.478
with her since we spun up.

00:43.521 --> 00:44.696
She doesn't know
you're in the hospital?

00:44.740 --> 00:46.263
SONNY:
Being honest with Hannah

00:46.307 --> 00:47.917
is courting disaster.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.527
You publish this paper,

00:49.571 --> 00:52.226
you are gonna start a shitstorm
that you want no part of.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.923
Is it crazy to think
that you and I

00:53.966 --> 00:55.881
-could start something?
-RAY: I have known

00:55.925 --> 00:58.232
Team guys
that started nonprofits.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.494
What's wrong?

00:59.537 --> 01:00.669
I've just got a lot
on my plate right now.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.367
-Okay, so tell me about it.
-It's on me.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.108
I don't want you
to have to pay for it.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.632
Maybe we shouldn't book
this room for a while.

01:07.676 --> 01:09.895
Yeah.
[groans]

01:14.161 --> 01:15.727
[steady beeping]

01:15.771 --> 01:17.990
It's a good sign that they-they
lowered the vent settings.

01:18.034 --> 01:20.558
That means his-his lungs
are getting stronger.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.346
Shouldn't have to be
on a ventilator at all.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.522
You know, if I'd just been
around a little more...

01:27.565 --> 01:29.828
All right,
for the hundredth time,

01:29.872 --> 01:31.613
you wouldn't
have prevented this.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.963
Trained doctors saw
no indication

01:34.006 --> 01:36.922
that I was at risk
for preterm labor.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.098
'Kay?

01:38.141 --> 01:39.142
[scoffs softly]

01:40.665 --> 01:43.842
You needed to be taking it easy.

01:43.886 --> 01:46.410
Instead, you were picking up
all my slack

01:46.454 --> 01:48.064
after I got spun up and...

01:48.108 --> 01:49.761
stressing out about me
being in the hospital...

01:49.805 --> 01:52.024
I know that it goes against
your frogman nature

01:52.068 --> 01:54.462
to believe that anything
is beyond your control,

01:54.505 --> 01:55.767
but this was.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.903
And the last two weeks
have proven to us

02:00.946 --> 02:03.079
that he's a fighter,

02:03.123 --> 02:04.907
like his father.

02:06.430 --> 02:09.955
Look how quickly he got out from
under those French fry lights.

02:14.395 --> 02:18.268
This isn't how I wanted
parenthood to start for us.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.491
JASON: You know, you could've
just brought me lunch.

02:23.534 --> 02:24.927
Didn't have to make it for me.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.015
EMMA:
Figured you could use some

02:26.058 --> 02:27.103
of the major food groups

02:27.147 --> 02:29.236
that don't involve lard
for once.

02:29.279 --> 02:30.889
You're telling me you came all
the way down here to lecture me

02:30.933 --> 02:32.587
-about my diet?
-You don't want to hear it,

02:32.630 --> 02:35.329
you should've scheduled yourself
an escape to the Sands.

02:35.372 --> 02:36.765
Huh?

02:36.808 --> 02:39.202
The Sands at Rehoboth?

02:39.246 --> 02:41.073
Time away with Mandy?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.990
You are still spending time away
with her, yeah?

02:45.034 --> 02:46.905
Uh, plate just got
a little full, you know?

02:46.949 --> 02:48.211
Team got blown up.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.518
-Mm.
-Pop-Pop, uh...

02:50.561 --> 02:52.215
his priorities,
they needed adjusting, too.

02:52.259 --> 02:55.218
Oh, the great protector looks
out for everyone but himself.

02:55.262 --> 02:58.526
I hope you're seeing her soon,
at least.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.223
[grunts]

03:01.137 --> 03:03.400
That's why you sounded so down.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.837
What happened
to accepting you deserve

03:05.881 --> 03:07.709
a full life away from Bravo?

03:07.752 --> 03:09.537
No, I'm... I'm not down.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.147
I am not down.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.279
Right.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.108
How can you be down

03:16.152 --> 03:17.240
when you're filling your hours
with brain games?

03:17.284 --> 03:19.677
It's fun games. It's puzzles.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.159
You don't like puzzles?

03:23.203 --> 03:25.901
I... am... good.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.252
This one could have potential.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.211
It used to be a dry cleaner.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.431
[chuckles] That is dark,
damp and depressing.

03:34.475 --> 03:37.521
The idea is for vets like Sam
to feel comfortable

03:37.565 --> 03:38.696
so they can get the help
they need.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.524
So we'll make it comfortable.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.265
Look, over here,

03:42.309 --> 03:46.530
a welcome desk
staffed with smiling faces.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.097
And over there

03:48.140 --> 03:49.664
-could be the yoga room.
-[sighs]

03:50.447 --> 03:53.537
[exhales] I guess
we could enclose this area here

03:53.581 --> 03:55.104
and it'd be a good place
for group therapy.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.845
There it is.

03:56.888 --> 04:00.283
Project like this requires
optimism and imagination.

04:00.327 --> 04:03.808
Y-Yeah. Not to mention
a lot of money and effort.

04:03.852 --> 04:06.724
I mean, babe, rent,
renovations, supplies, staff.

04:06.768 --> 04:09.074
The money Mom gave us from
the first responders settlement

04:09.118 --> 04:10.641
-is not gonna cover all that.
-Look,

04:10.685 --> 04:12.730
I can talk to some fundraising
people at the hospital.

04:12.774 --> 04:15.559
I-I know there are ways.

04:15.603 --> 04:18.649
Grants, loans,
financial partners.

04:18.693 --> 04:22.392
Look, whatever it takes until
your 20-year pension kicks in.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.829
I keep telling you
that if Command determines

04:24.873 --> 04:26.788
that I was hiding my PTS
in Nigeria,

04:26.831 --> 04:28.485
I won't even make it to 20.

04:28.529 --> 04:31.662
Well, then it's a good thing
you have this as a backup plan.

04:31.706 --> 04:34.752
See? More optimism.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.408
-[crying]
-Oh, come on, munchkin.

04:38.452 --> 04:41.455
This refusal to sleep
is not a good look for you.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.457
Okay? Well, she's...

04:43.500 --> 04:45.763
she's definitely got
her daddy's stubborn gene,

04:45.807 --> 04:47.156
-that's for sure.
-Mm-hmm.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.506
Never had this issue back home.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.508
This is your home.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.380
Just sleep regression.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.425
Yeah. Book says it's normal.

04:55.469 --> 04:56.600
Ain't that right?

04:56.644 --> 04:57.906
I can't help she sits around

04:57.949 --> 04:59.386
watching her mama do nothing
all day.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.649
-Kids learn what they live.
-Come on, now.

05:01.692 --> 05:04.129
Thought we were trying to raise
a confident girl here.

05:04.173 --> 05:08.525
Yeah. My role modeling will get
better once I get a job.

05:08.569 --> 05:11.920
Who knew a sociology degree
and 15 years running a bar

05:11.963 --> 05:14.575
wouldn't open up doors
to a newcomer in town?

05:14.618 --> 05:15.924
You know, uh,

05:15.967 --> 05:18.230
I could put a word in
at the Bulkhead for you.

05:18.274 --> 05:21.973
[chuckles] Lord knows
they owe me a favor or two

05:22.017 --> 05:23.453
with the fortune
that I dropped in there.

05:23.497 --> 05:26.413
Running a bar,
that means being on call 24-7.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.153
I'm gonna need
a lot of babysitting favors

05:28.197 --> 05:30.330
from your friends' wives
when you get spun up.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.592
They're up for it.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.376
It's what we do around here.

05:33.420 --> 05:36.248
'Sides, I-I got
all our expenses covered.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.250
You know,
just take your time and...

05:38.294 --> 05:41.297
figure out a dream job
for that sociology degree.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.995
Yeah. What do you want to be
when you grow up?

05:44.039 --> 05:45.562
Huh? What do you want to be?

05:45.606 --> 05:48.522
You want to be the first person
to walk on Mars?

05:48.565 --> 05:50.132
Do ya?

05:50.175 --> 05:52.613
Or maybe Daddy's gonna have
to reconsider his stance

05:52.656 --> 05:54.005
on female SEALs,

05:54.049 --> 05:55.529
-if that's what you dreamed of.
-[giggles]

05:55.572 --> 05:59.750
But you need to sleep
before you dream, munchkin.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.186
You hear that?

06:01.230 --> 06:03.624
[steady beeping]

06:03.667 --> 06:04.755
I've done this

06:04.799 --> 06:06.409
-a time or two now.
-[phone buzzing]

06:06.453 --> 06:08.019
It's hard for me not to...

06:08.063 --> 06:08.977
-Here, can you grab that?
-Sorry.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.413
-Thanks.
-Here.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.371
It's Sonny.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.589
He's just checking on the baby.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.939
You want me to write back
for you?

06:14.983 --> 06:16.245
Yeah, you can just...

06:16.288 --> 06:17.681
Wait, there's more,
there's more.

06:17.725 --> 06:20.075
The guys are being called in.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.729
You think
they're getting spun up?

06:21.772 --> 06:24.558
Parental leave means I'm...

06:24.601 --> 06:26.298
out of the loop.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.953
Well, do you want to...

06:28.997 --> 06:30.781
You want to go see what's up?

06:32.479 --> 06:34.829
No. Look, I...

06:34.872 --> 06:37.832
I hate to leave here,
even for a second.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.575
Look, neither one of us
have had much of a break

06:41.618 --> 06:43.968
in the last two weeks, right?

06:44.012 --> 06:48.016
You haven't seen the guys
since the baby was born.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.109
Maybe you can...
You know, you'll have a chance

06:54.152 --> 06:56.328
to have that talk with Jason,
too, so...

06:56.372 --> 07:00.637
The only upside
to baby boy coming early:

07:00.681 --> 07:03.205
been forgetting how hard it's
gonna be letting my team leader

07:03.248 --> 07:05.729
and mentor know that...

07:05.773 --> 07:08.166
he may no longer be fit to lead.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.954
Uh, best-case scenario, you
just catch up with your brothers

07:12.997 --> 07:15.130
and, um...

07:15.173 --> 07:17.480
you can bring me back
a vanilla latte.

07:18.350 --> 07:19.787
Be back as soon as possible,

07:19.830 --> 07:20.962
-all right?
-Okay. All right.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.920
-You got that?
-Yeah, yeah.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.357
Don't overfeed him now.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.490
[sniffs]
Hey.

07:28.709 --> 07:31.538
I won't be gone long,
little man, all right?

07:32.626 --> 07:34.279
Bye, Tiny.

07:38.675 --> 07:39.981
You know what this is about?

07:40.024 --> 07:42.200
-Thought you would.
-Oh.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.464
-[chattering]
-Afternoon, Captain Morris.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.249
Geez. The hell was that about?

07:47.292 --> 07:49.381
My white paper's
making some waves.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.906
Uh, you know, Command's
not too happy with my thesis

07:51.949 --> 07:54.648
or my arguments
or my conclusions.

07:54.691 --> 07:57.912
I mean, I knew that going in,
but I just...

07:57.955 --> 07:59.653
Trouble finds you in this job.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.219
Don't have to go looking for it.

08:04.266 --> 08:07.312
Looks like the, uh, parental
leave policy's been canked.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.010
-Look at this, huh?
-[chuckles softly]

08:09.053 --> 08:11.360
Question is, man,
how you all holding up?

08:11.403 --> 08:13.667
Good, man. Just, uh,
you know, best we can.

08:13.710 --> 08:16.191
Jaundice is gone, and...

08:16.234 --> 08:17.540
lungs are clearing up,
so, you know,

08:17.584 --> 08:19.281
clear a new hurdle
every few days.

08:19.324 --> 08:20.630
Sounds like things are going
in the right direction.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.154
Okay, tell me right now.
Is this where you reveal

08:23.198 --> 08:24.678
your baby's name?

08:24.721 --> 08:26.897
Honestly, I think
we're gonna wait till we can...

08:26.941 --> 08:28.246
we can hold the little guy
before we...

08:28.290 --> 08:29.770
-Right.
-...before we settle on one

08:29.813 --> 08:30.771
-that fits him best.
-Yeah.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.033
I'm sorry, but "Percival"

08:32.076 --> 08:33.425
-didn't make the cut.
-[laughing]

08:33.469 --> 08:34.949
Obviously, he doesn't have
a big hammer.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.341
-That's actually the, uh...
-[laughs]

08:36.385 --> 08:37.908
-...favorite of the list.
-All right, listen up.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.040
Spense,

08:39.083 --> 08:39.780
-what are you doing here?
-[door closes]

08:39.823 --> 08:41.303
You need me to step out?

08:41.346 --> 08:43.479
That's Bravo 6.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.307
Technically,
he's on parental leave.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.351
He can stay.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.572
Everyone, this is Keith Kincaid.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.792
He's a lawyer

08:57.711 --> 08:59.190
You've been called here today

08:59.234 --> 09:01.715
for an Omega operation
in South America,

09:01.758 --> 09:04.631
ranging from one to six months.

09:04.674 --> 09:05.980
To do what?

09:06.023 --> 09:08.243
Details will only be given
in-country.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.332
KINCAID: Per Omega,

09:11.725 --> 09:13.596
in both Title 10 and Title 50.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.164
That means you're not
technically working for the DoD,

nor are you technically
recognized by the CIA.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.430

complete autonomy to execute

09:21.473 --> 09:23.606

No oversight, no backstop and,
most importantly, no footprint.

09:27.392 --> 09:28.568
KINCAID:
For these reasons,

09:28.611 --> 09:31.179
this operation
is completely voluntary.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.573
ERIC:
Should you choose to accept,

09:33.616 --> 09:35.183
you will no longer be
Bravo Team,

under the protections of DEVGRU

09:38.665 --> 09:40.362

09:40.405 --> 09:43.539
Life as you know it
is going to change.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.672
You will be assigned
new identities.

09:45.715 --> 09:48.588
Communications with folks
back home will be limited.

09:49.371 --> 09:52.635
In every sense,
you will be on your own.

09:52.679 --> 09:55.377
No cavalry, no QRF.

I mean...

19:05.927 --> 19:07.755
We both love our little girl,

19:07.798 --> 19:11.324
and we want to do
what's best for her, but...

19:11.367 --> 19:14.718
maybe we're just playing house
for her sake.

19:14.762 --> 19:17.982
You serious?
I mean, th-this feels...

19:18.026 --> 19:19.854
-real to me. I mean...
-Does it?

19:19.897 --> 19:22.465
I saw you when we had drinks
with Davis.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.293
The spark's still alive

19:24.337 --> 19:25.642
-between you two.
-Hey. Come on.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.296
I-I've told you,

19:27.340 --> 19:30.299
okay, it's-it's over
between Davis and I.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.214
Uh... It's all about

19:32.258 --> 19:33.389
you and Leanne now.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.174
That may be true.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.654
But not telling me

19:37.698 --> 19:39.787
you were in a hospital overseas?

19:39.830 --> 19:42.355
That's not the sign
of a healthy relationship.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.922
Okay, well,
we've hit a rough patch, then.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.620
All right? I'll-- I will--

19:46.663 --> 19:49.275
I'll stay home from the op
and I will just...

19:49.318 --> 19:51.755
100% focus on us.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.931
That's got to help, right?

19:55.498 --> 19:56.847
If there were no Leanne,

19:56.891 --> 19:59.154
would you be gripping so hard
right now?

20:04.072 --> 20:06.988
Do you even think
you're in love with me?

20:14.169 --> 20:15.953
I want to be.

20:15.997 --> 20:18.782
And I want to be
in love with you.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.179
But Leanne deserves better

20:24.223 --> 20:27.965
than just a family
playing make-believe.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.142
And you and I do, too.

20:31.186 --> 20:33.232
What are you saying right now?

20:36.757 --> 20:39.673
I think Leanne and I
should move home.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.992
-And how long will you be gone?
-I don't know.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.647
And how do I get
in touch with you?

20:57.691 --> 21:01.347
Uh, like I always got
in touch with you, all right?

21:01.390 --> 21:03.305
I'll get in touch with you,
you don't get in touch with me.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.438
You know the drill. Okay?

21:05.481 --> 21:08.310
And do not make
any major life decisions

21:08.354 --> 21:10.399
before I'm back, you got it?

21:10.443 --> 21:12.140
Really? That's the last thing
you want to say to me

21:12.183 --> 21:13.663
before you go? Hmm.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.970
Yeah, well, 'cause I mean it.

21:16.013 --> 21:17.580
You have to let this go.

21:17.624 --> 21:21.454
You and Mom were married
by the time you were my age.

21:21.497 --> 21:24.761
Your mom sacrificed a lot for me
so I could be with the teams.

21:24.805 --> 21:27.286
All right? Now with Brad
heading off to BUD/S,

21:27.329 --> 21:28.983
that puts you on the same path.

21:29.026 --> 21:31.333
It doesn't have to.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.206
Look...

21:35.250 --> 21:37.600
this war's not going anywhere,
you understand?

21:37.644 --> 21:39.733
All right? It's only breaking
the people that fight it

21:39.776 --> 21:42.518
and, sadly, breaking
the people who love them.

21:42.562 --> 21:46.043
You make Mom sound like
some tragic victim.

21:47.218 --> 21:48.394
Your mom suffered because of me.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.396
-All right?
-What's that mean?

21:50.439 --> 21:51.745
[exhales]

21:51.788 --> 21:54.356
Visits from Grandma Linda
and Pop-Pop swooping in

21:54.400 --> 21:56.445
like Mary Poppins when I was
gone, does that ring a bell?

21:56.489 --> 22:00.319
Mom was one of the strongest
people I've ever known.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.929
She didn't back down
from challenges,

22:01.972 --> 22:03.974
and she knew
when to ask for help.

22:05.149 --> 22:07.413
You know what,
if Brad wants to end up busted

22:07.456 --> 22:09.371
and full of regrets,
that's fine,

22:09.415 --> 22:11.068
just don't make
the same mistakes.

22:11.112 --> 22:15.246
I'm not Mom, but more
importantly, Brad is not you.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.423
What's that supposed to mean?

22:17.466 --> 22:20.382
You were so close, Dad,
to the life you deserve.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.602
Breaks my heart
seeing you retreat back

22:22.645 --> 22:24.734
into your miserable
three-foot world.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.520
You know what, don't worry

22:27.563 --> 22:29.696
about reaching out
while you're gone.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.699
Fine, I won't.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.577
[monitor beeping steadily]

22:46.843 --> 22:48.584
Hi, baby.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.196
Thank you for that.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.851
CLAY:
He's so helpless.

22:54.895 --> 22:57.463
Well, we're doing everything
we can to protect him.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.509
Wish everything
was so black and white.

23:03.817 --> 23:07.255
Are you still trying to figure
out how to talk to Jason?

23:10.084 --> 23:12.086
Confronting him on the eve
of deploying

23:12.129 --> 23:13.957
would just mess
with his head even more,

23:14.001 --> 23:16.133
put Bravo more at risk.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.355
I just have to,

23:20.399 --> 23:22.966
you know, trust
that he'll go on the op,

23:23.010 --> 23:24.707
the team will be okay.

23:24.751 --> 23:28.407
There's no way that you're
comfortable with that scenario.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.586
You're thinking
about going with them.

23:36.110 --> 23:41.245
You would be there to protect
him, protect your brothers?

23:41.289 --> 23:45.946
If I go, I-I can't
confront him down there.

23:47.164 --> 23:49.253
I mean, I-I would
just be his backstop,

23:49.297 --> 23:51.691
try and keep the team safe.

23:54.215 --> 23:55.869
But I can't leave you
and our unnamed baby

23:55.912 --> 23:57.914
just here in the NICU behind.

23:57.958 --> 24:02.179
I mean, after-after I promised
I would never abandon you again.

24:13.800 --> 24:17.238
Look, I'll-I'll do whatever
you want, all right?

24:21.198 --> 24:23.244
[chuckles]
Come on, you know

24:23.287 --> 24:26.073
you're not actually
giving me a choice, right?

24:26.987 --> 24:28.858
I mean, if I tell you
to stay home

24:28.902 --> 24:31.121
and something happens to them,
would you ever forgive me?

24:34.298 --> 24:36.039
Would you forgive yourself?

24:37.127 --> 24:38.825
So you think I should go?

24:38.868 --> 24:41.654
I think that I would give
anything to not have

24:41.697 --> 24:44.047
the-the two most important
people in my life

24:44.091 --> 24:46.615
in harm's way at the same time.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.927
But I also think...

24:53.970 --> 24:56.059
[sighs]

24:56.103 --> 25:00.150
I also think that, without you,
Bravo will have no safety net

25:00.194 --> 25:03.284
and Jason will have no backstop.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.985
Whatever you do,
it has to be your choice.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.609
Grant, hey, it's me.
Again. Ah...

25:23.652 --> 25:25.872
Um, look, I know you have
a crazy day today.

25:25.915 --> 25:29.397
I just really didn't want to
leave this over your voice mail.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.094
I have to go out of town
for work.

25:31.138 --> 25:35.621
Um, I hate going, since we're
in such a good groove, but...

25:35.664 --> 25:37.884
I don't have a choice.
[clears throat]

25:37.927 --> 25:41.714
So, um, look, I guess I'll ju--
I'm gonna try you again later.

25:41.757 --> 25:42.889
Okay.

25:42.932 --> 25:44.717
Sir.

25:44.760 --> 25:48.677
Just wanted to say
that I am so excited

25:48.721 --> 25:50.026
about, you know,

25:50.070 --> 25:51.593
-being a part of Omega Team.
-Mm.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.465
I know that this is a privilege
for me to be included,

25:54.509 --> 25:56.816
-and I'm grateful.
-Well, it is a privilege,

25:56.859 --> 26:00.689
one that not everyone on Command
felt you merited.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.952
-Because of my paper?
-Yeah.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.824
I argued that you're
more than qualified,

26:04.867 --> 26:08.871
and sending you with Bravo
makes the most tactical sense.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.700
Whether they agreed with me
or saw this as an opportunity

26:11.744 --> 26:14.616
to send you into a hole
for a few months is unclear.

26:14.660 --> 26:15.878
I see.

26:15.922 --> 26:17.532
Is there a reason why
you're reading me in

26:17.576 --> 26:19.186
on these details now?

26:19.229 --> 26:21.536
I warned you about that paper.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.756
The damage to your career
has begun.

26:23.799 --> 26:26.802
It's on you to figure out
how to control it.

26:26.846 --> 26:29.065
Yes, sir.

26:29.109 --> 26:31.198

the two guys who normally

28:30.404 --> 28:33.712
can't wait to get
outside the wire to kick doors.

28:33.755 --> 28:36.323
Just focused up is all.
You know the drill.

SONNY:
I'm happy to just have

28:37.890 --> 28:39.369
Vah Beach in my rearview mirror.

28:39.413 --> 28:42.155
Even though I am
flying commercial.

28:42.198 --> 28:44.679
[chuckles]
Oh, Omega op protocol, man.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.160
Staggered commercial flights
keeps us clean.

in, uh, Riohacha by now.

Should be connected
with our contacts.

Brock all alone
in Colombia, huh?

28:55.690 --> 28:57.518
What could possibly go wrong?

28:57.561 --> 28:59.259
What the hell
are you doing here?

28:59.302 --> 29:00.782
Thought I told you
we don't need you for this one.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.785
-All in all the time.
-SONNY: What, you're deploying

29:03.829 --> 29:05.961
while your kid's
in the hospital?

Look, man,
the doctor can do more

29:07.049 --> 29:08.268
for my kid right now than I can.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.793
No room for the home front
on an Omega.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.577
I need all my guys dialed in.

29:13.621 --> 29:15.579
My focus is on Bravo.

My flight's next.
See you all in-country.

29:33.423 --> 29:36.426
Hey, Clay,
we chose rooms already.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.777
Thought we should
stick you with Sonny.

Yeah, you know, we thought
you needed a little practice

to a gassy, whiny kid.

-Blackburn says hi.

before I moved to the Agency.

He speaks highly
of your team's abilities,

30:02.104 --> 30:04.628
which will be put to the test
while you're down here.

30:04.672 --> 30:07.849
Well, hopefully that, uh,
RadioShack keypad

30:07.893 --> 30:10.591
isn't put to the test
protecting this safe house.

30:10.634 --> 30:13.246
This residence is not intended
to be a stronghold.

30:13.289 --> 30:15.857
While you'll need to maintain
cover here in Riohacha,

30:15.901 --> 30:17.467
it is a permissive environment.

30:17.511 --> 30:20.296
Your operations
will be over the border.

-Venezuela.

spent a decade there one week.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.262

come under siege this time.

over the course of the Omega.

secure cell phones, pistols

to maintain cover.

If you don't see what you need,
I've got guys who can get it.

30:44.146 --> 30:46.583
Only thing missing is any clue
what we're doing down here.

30:46.627 --> 30:50.022
After Bravo Team's rescue
of Dr. Jin from North Korea,

30:50.065 --> 30:52.111
he's proven to be
a critical source for the Agency

30:52.154 --> 30:55.549
in our efforts to monitor
nuclear armament worldwide.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.029
Right this way.

30:57.072 --> 31:01.381
One of Dr. Jin's students
is this man,

31:01.424 --> 31:05.602
Dr. Francisco Guillen,
a Venezuelan national.

31:05.646 --> 31:08.649
Since leaving his training
in North Korea,

31:08.692 --> 31:11.086
intel says Dr. Guillen
is developing

31:11.130 --> 31:13.349
a Venezuelan nuclear weapons
program.

31:13.393 --> 31:17.353
So we got a volatile state
in our hemisphere getting nukes?

31:17.397 --> 31:19.573
That is the stuff
of Cold War nightmares.

31:19.616 --> 31:20.879
We're here to take him out?

SMITH:
This Omega's strategic mission

31:22.141 --> 31:23.185
is dismantling

31:23.229 --> 31:24.534
the Venezuelan
nuclear weapons program.

31:24.578 --> 31:27.886
All indications are that
a capture/kill of Guillen

31:27.929 --> 31:29.409
will strike a fatal blow to it.

31:29.452 --> 31:31.759
You got a lot of legwork
on this wallpaper.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.327
I mean, did you have a team
running CTR on Guillen?

31:34.370 --> 31:36.024
Ground Branch tracked him
for weeks

31:36.068 --> 31:39.071
where he resides in Maracaibo,
establishing pattern of life.

31:39.114 --> 31:40.463
CLAY:
I imagine the Venezuelans keep

31:40.507 --> 31:41.638
a pretty tight watch on the guy

31:41.682 --> 31:42.813
who could single-handedly
promote them

31:42.857 --> 31:44.076
to global threat.

31:44.119 --> 31:46.382
On the rare occasion
when he emerges

31:46.426 --> 31:49.733
from his gilded cage
where he's kept,

31:49.777 --> 31:52.475
Guillen is shadowed
by a constant security detail.

31:52.519 --> 31:53.650
We'll get him.

31:53.694 --> 31:55.217
SMITH:
Challenge is in neutralizing him

31:55.261 --> 31:56.479
while leaving no trace.

31:56.523 --> 31:58.525
I'll let you get to it.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.487
JASON:
Tomorrow we take this guy out.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.228
Davis, how long
is it gonna take you

32:06.272 --> 32:08.056
to install
the vehicle-hacking software?

32:08.100 --> 32:09.884
Matter of seconds
for a stationary vehicle.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.625
The signal routes
through the Bluetooth

32:11.668 --> 32:13.670
on the HVT's cell phone
into the car's computer,

32:13.714 --> 32:15.846
so he and the driver
will have no clue.

32:15.890 --> 32:18.501
Based on the pattern of life,
Guillen will make

32:18.545 --> 32:20.851
his weekly trip
to this restaurant right here.

32:20.895 --> 32:22.505
And after dinner,
he'll come back to his car,

32:22.549 --> 32:24.855
he'll head back home
across that bridge.

32:24.899 --> 32:26.031
SONNY:
And then we'll play

32:26.074 --> 32:27.641
a massive game
of Grand Theft Auto.

32:27.684 --> 32:29.469
DAVIS: We'll have total control
over the target vehicle's

32:29.512 --> 32:31.079
acceleration,
the brakes, the steering.

32:31.123 --> 32:32.515
We'll drive him
right off the bridge.

32:32.559 --> 32:34.561
-"Look, a tragic accident."
-And the Venezuelans'

32:34.604 --> 32:37.172
atomic plans will go
"Hasta la vista,baby."

32:37.216 --> 32:38.608
Yeah, we hope.

32:38.652 --> 32:39.653
What do you mean, you hope?

32:39.696 --> 32:40.871
I mean, what if there's more

32:40.915 --> 32:42.482
to the-the nuclear program
than Guillen?

32:42.525 --> 32:44.310
Right? More that he could
shine a light on.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.312
RAY:
Mm. Clay's right.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.009
Guillen could provide
priceless intel.

32:48.053 --> 32:51.099
We're here to dismantle their
whole program, not just one man.

32:51.143 --> 32:52.535
Capture may be
the better option.

32:52.579 --> 32:54.102
No, this isn't an option.

32:54.146 --> 32:55.538
SONNY:
If Guillen vanishes,

32:55.582 --> 32:57.627
the Venezuelan program
is gonna go so deep,

32:57.671 --> 32:59.325
you may never get
a shot at it again.

32:59.368 --> 33:00.761
Yeah, so we-we grab Guillen

33:00.804 --> 33:02.458
without them ever knowing
he's gone.

33:04.591 --> 33:07.376
Your plan still works,
we just add one element.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.726
-Pixie dust?
-Divers.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.206
RAY:
A dive team could wait

33:11.250 --> 33:12.512
under the bridge
and pull Guillen

33:12.555 --> 33:13.992
from the wreckage
while he's still alive.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.558
You're telling me
that no one's gonna suspect

33:15.602 --> 33:17.343
that the driver's missing
when they dredge up the car?

33:17.386 --> 33:18.692
It could've washed out
with the tide.

33:18.735 --> 33:20.868
This is not Dr. Jin,
looking to defect.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.478
I'm gonna have to agree.

33:22.522 --> 33:24.872
I mean, everything on the wall
says this guy's a true believer.

33:24.915 --> 33:26.874
JASON: That's right.
You know, he won't cooperate.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.180
Not worth the risk.

33:28.223 --> 33:30.617
No ranks in Omega.

33:32.358 --> 33:33.881
We all get a say.

33:33.924 --> 33:35.448
There's only one person
in this room

33:35.491 --> 33:38.625
who can make a call like this,
and it's not Bravo 6.

33:38.668 --> 33:42.063
Hey, why don't we take
five minutes, man?

33:45.719 --> 33:47.590
Come on, man.

33:54.641 --> 33:58.210
Look, you said your piece.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.864
We both know Jason's
not gonna back down.

34:02.214 --> 34:05.956
Uh, makes him stubborn,
not right.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.132
You and I aren't
the only ones seeing

34:07.175 --> 34:10.178
that capture's
the smarter play here.

34:10.222 --> 34:11.527
Let's put it to vote.

34:11.571 --> 34:15.836
Clay, it may be no ranks
down here,

34:15.879 --> 34:17.838
but what happens
when we get back home

34:17.881 --> 34:19.927
and it's back to Bravo as usual?
How's that go?

34:19.970 --> 34:23.800
What happens in Venezuela
will not stay in Venezuela.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.934
You'd rather lose a chance
at critical intel

34:26.977 --> 34:29.110
-than step on Jason's toes?
-That capture plan

34:29.154 --> 34:31.112
is not a sure thing.

34:31.156 --> 34:34.768
It goes sideways, we blow this
whole op before it even starts.

34:34.811 --> 34:36.335
Now, if you want
to put it to a vote,

34:36.378 --> 34:39.947
my vote is to not start
Bravo Civil War on day one.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.734
Come on. Let's go
knock this thing down.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.660
Hey, slow your roll, Sonny.
Yeah, I already prepped

34:57.704 --> 34:58.922
all that stuff, man,
you're screwing it up.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.359
Look, just because
you didn't get your way

35:00.402 --> 35:01.708
with the op plan

35:01.751 --> 35:03.666
doesn't mean you need
to micromanage me, okay?

35:03.710 --> 35:05.973
Them NICU doctors,

35:06.016 --> 35:07.757
they probably got
sick and tired of you

35:07.801 --> 35:09.629
standing over their shoulder,
telling 'em what to do,

35:09.672 --> 35:11.805
so they sent you packing, huh?

35:11.848 --> 35:14.982
Look, I'm here because I have
a responsibility to this team.

35:15.025 --> 35:17.463
[chuckles] You really think your
shit don't stink, don't you?

35:17.506 --> 35:19.204
Hmm?

35:19.247 --> 35:21.554
God, what would happen to us
if Bravo 6

35:21.597 --> 35:22.990
wasn't here to save us all?

35:23.033 --> 35:25.775
Hey. Roll out in five,
two vehicles.

35:25.819 --> 35:29.127
Davis, you're with me,
to deploy the software.

35:32.565 --> 35:34.175
Gonna be in the middle
of the action again.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.307
I'm ready.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.178
CLAY:
Hey, Davis, I can, uh,

35:37.222 --> 35:39.920
I can be in there with you
and help you run whatever tech.

35:39.963 --> 35:43.184
Uh, Jace, you got
your favorite back seat driver.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.577
Hey, fuck off, Sonny.

35:44.620 --> 35:45.491
-Hey, hey. Settle down, man.
-Whoa, whoa.

35:45.534 --> 35:47.623
Hey.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.321
Clay, Sonny, ride together.

35:49.364 --> 35:51.149
The rest of you with me.

36:01.289 --> 36:03.813
[birds chirping]

36:03.857 --> 36:06.773
I got to relieve myself
after that four-hour drive.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.559
Guess this should work.

36:11.995 --> 36:14.302
Are you serious, man?
Haven't you heard?

36:14.346 --> 36:16.043
Everything's bigger in Texas.

36:16.086 --> 36:17.566
Yeah, okay.

36:18.872 --> 36:23.268
Oh. Dr. Guillen looks like
he's living pretty large.

36:23.311 --> 36:25.922
Sure he's got a few bathrooms
in there.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.579
CLAY: Well, man knows how
to kill a half a million people

36:30.623 --> 36:31.841
with an atom.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.627
Makes sense they'd want
to keep him comfy.

36:34.670 --> 36:36.759
SONNY:
Well, hope he enjoyed it.

36:38.805 --> 36:41.024
'Cause he's getting
in his coffin.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.247
[engine starts]

36:53.950 --> 36:55.996
Target vehicle is moving.

36:56.039 --> 36:57.519
JASON:
That's good copy.

36:57.563 --> 36:58.868
[engine starts]

36:58.912 --> 37:00.870
Stick close.

37:21.282 --> 37:24.720
HVT's vehicle is approaching
your pos.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.253
It's connecting.

37:36.906 --> 37:39.126
[men speaking Spanish]

37:39.909 --> 37:41.476
-[computer beeps]
-Upload complete.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.086
Let me test it.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.267
Looks good.

37:59.059 --> 38:01.017
Target upload's complete.

38:02.584 --> 38:05.761
Sonny, seriously? It's a bottle.

38:15.771 --> 38:18.208
1, this is 6.

38:19.862 --> 38:21.255
Target vehicle
still hasn't moved.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.778
JASON:
Copy. Keep eyes on.

38:22.822 --> 38:25.433
Once HVT is back on road, RTB.

38:25.477 --> 38:27.305
Hey, you want us
to stick around here,

38:27.348 --> 38:30.395
-hang tight and back you up?
-Negative. You will RTB.

38:31.961 --> 38:33.093
[sniffles]

38:33.136 --> 38:35.008
All the variables on this one,

38:35.051 --> 38:38.272
I don't know why he doesn't
want us to stay close.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.927
Back seat driving
from another car.

38:40.970 --> 38:43.103
All right. Magnificent.

38:44.626 --> 38:47.020
Look, man, I just want
to get home to my kid.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.891
Okay, the quicker that
we dismantle this program,

38:48.935 --> 38:50.240
the quicker we get back
to our families.

38:50.284 --> 38:53.113
Look, I refuse to take
family advice from a guy

38:53.156 --> 38:56.116
who blew town while his kid's
still in the hospital.

38:56.159 --> 38:58.684
Look, man, I-I think
you seem to forget

38:58.727 --> 39:00.642
that you left
your family behind, too.

39:00.686 --> 39:02.905
I ain't got no family to forget.

39:05.865 --> 39:07.301
What does that mean?

39:13.829 --> 39:18.181
Leanne was ripped away from me
right before we, uh, spun up.

39:20.270 --> 39:23.143
Hannah decided to take her
back to Texas.

39:28.670 --> 39:29.802
Sonny, I'm sorry, man.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.847
Spare me your pity.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.993
1, this is 6.
Target vehicle's on the move.

39:47.036 --> 39:49.996
-JASON: Copy, 6.
-[engine starts]

40:01.399 --> 40:03.009
JASON:
Who are these guys?

40:03.052 --> 40:05.011
Briefcases say business.

40:05.054 --> 40:06.621
Ray, you're gonna want
to ID them.

40:06.665 --> 40:08.057
On it.

40:08.101 --> 40:11.017
[camera shutter clicking]

40:11.060 --> 40:13.367
Look at the way Guillen's
kissing their asses.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.325
Must be VIPs.

40:23.246 --> 40:24.770
Want Team 1 to follow?

40:24.813 --> 40:26.380
Not worth the risk of exposure.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.513
We'll run their pictures through
the Agency database for ID.

40:28.556 --> 40:29.992
-3, RTB.
-CLAY: Are you sure

40:30.036 --> 40:32.125
-you don't need more eyes?
-Negative. RTB now.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.958
[woman shouting]

40:39.001 --> 40:40.829
What is this?

40:40.873 --> 40:44.267
Looks like Guillen must have
a hard time hearing no.

40:44.311 --> 40:46.835
Jesus. They're putting
a civilian in the car.

40:46.879 --> 40:48.228
There's no way
we're gonna crash it now.

40:49.403 --> 40:51.492
[shouting]

40:51.536 --> 40:53.451
Hey, what are you doing?

-[people shouting]

41:02.851 --> 41:04.592
[tires screeching]

41:04.636 --> 41:06.681
-JASON: Let's go.
-Eh, so much for zero footprint.

41:06.725 --> 41:08.640
Stay on them. Move!

41:08.683 --> 41:10.424
[tires screeching]

41:15.995 --> 41:17.518
He's changing routes.

41:17.562 --> 41:18.998
Shots spooked them.

41:23.829 --> 41:25.134
[tires screeching]

41:25.178 --> 41:27.702
That truck's VSP.
Death squad we locked horns with

41:27.746 --> 41:29.530
-the last time we were here.
-Yeah, the two-inch scar

41:29.574 --> 41:31.358
-on my scalp remembers.
-RAY: We got to cut bait.

41:31.401 --> 41:32.272
He'll be at the restaurant

41:32.315 --> 41:33.491
-same time next week.
-No,

41:33.534 --> 41:34.796
if they're scared enough
to call in the VSP,

41:34.840 --> 41:35.841
they're gonna change
up their pattern

41:35.884 --> 41:36.929
and Guillen's gonna vanish.

41:36.972 --> 41:38.887
We won't have another chance.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.766
VSP attached itself to HVT.

41:47.809 --> 41:49.028
Waiting for them to drop off

41:49.071 --> 41:50.420
before we make our move
on the target car.

41:50.464 --> 41:51.726
Yeah, copy, 2.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.032
We're turning around to assist.

41:53.075 --> 41:54.599
Clay wants to provide support.

41:54.642 --> 41:57.297
No, we do not need another
vehicle drawing attention.

41:57.340 --> 41:58.864
Will you call him off?

41:59.734 --> 42:01.519
We're managing, 6.
Continue to RTB.

42:02.345 --> 42:04.304
We got to turn around.

42:04.347 --> 42:07.046
Did you got your wires crossed
in your comms there?

42:07.089 --> 42:08.438
You heard him say no.

42:08.482 --> 42:09.918
I heard "VSP."

42:09.962 --> 42:11.224
All right?
Op's already sideways,

42:11.267 --> 42:13.139
and now there's killers
in the mix.

42:16.142 --> 42:17.578
[tires screeching]

42:20.450 --> 42:22.365
Team 2, we're heading
your direction

42:22.409 --> 42:23.671
to remove the HVT's
security escort.

42:23.715 --> 42:25.194
RAY: Our chance
is slipping away, Jace.

42:25.238 --> 42:27.196
If he's got an idea,
let's hear it.

42:29.808 --> 42:32.071
-CLAY: Here they come.
-[engines approaching]

42:36.597 --> 42:40.209
I got eyes on the target
vehicle and VSP security escort.

42:40.253 --> 42:41.907
You got one shot at this.

42:41.950 --> 42:44.257
Got to make them think
it's a blowout.

42:48.783 --> 42:50.045

42:52.918 --> 42:55.529
[men speaking Spanish]

42:55.573 --> 42:56.965
JASON: Okay, just take it easy.
Slow down.

42:57.009 --> 42:58.619
All right? Stay back.

42:58.663 --> 42:59.794
They don't buy
that's a flat tire,

42:59.838 --> 43:00.752
they're gonna go
shields up right here.

43:13.808 --> 43:14.940
Go. Go.

43:33.872 --> 43:36.657
We're less than two klicks
from Guillen's house.

43:36.701 --> 43:38.050
Window's closing fast.

43:42.402 --> 43:43.925
Uh, we need to pick our spot.

43:43.969 --> 43:45.971
T intersection up ahead,
he'll have to go left or right.

43:46.014 --> 43:47.929
Brock, get closer to him,
will you?

43:47.973 --> 43:49.627
JASON: It's now or never.
Davis, take control.

43:59.332 --> 44:00.681
[engine revs]

44:22.921 --> 44:25.663
Guess a deployment beer
doesn't taste as sweet

44:25.706 --> 44:27.273
when there's no general order
prohibiting it.

44:27.316 --> 44:28.883
Uh, deployment beer tastes

44:28.927 --> 44:30.406
so much better
when you get a fire.

44:30.450 --> 44:32.887
We should, uh, see what we can
grab from down here

44:32.931 --> 44:34.715
and torch up on the roof.

44:34.759 --> 44:36.412
RAY [chuckles]:
Oh, yeah, a rooftop inferno

44:36.456 --> 44:37.762
is gonna do wonders
for our cover.

44:37.805 --> 44:39.720
Drew enough attention
to ourselves on that op,

44:39.764 --> 44:41.200
I mean, it can't hurt.

44:41.243 --> 44:43.028
What, do you got a problem
with that execution?

44:43.071 --> 44:44.246
RAY: Look, it wasn't as slick
as we planned,

44:44.290 --> 44:45.813
but we got it done.

44:45.857 --> 44:47.162
Guillen is erased.

44:47.206 --> 44:48.729
Hey, the two guys we saw
with Guillen?

44:48.773 --> 44:51.340
FRS just identified them
as Ephraim Zaid

44:51.384 --> 44:52.515
and Arman Soroush.

44:52.559 --> 44:53.865
Iranian nationals.

44:53.908 --> 44:55.344
RAY:
Iranians?

44:55.388 --> 44:57.216
They're no strangers
to the nuclear game.

44:57.259 --> 44:58.434
You think they're involved
down here?

44:58.478 --> 44:59.827
Zaid and Soroush
are top-tier leadership

44:59.871 --> 45:01.394
in the Iranian nuclear program.

45:01.437 --> 45:03.178
They wouldn't waste their time
on some pipe dream.

45:03.222 --> 45:06.921
If they're here,
the Venezuelan program is real.

45:06.965 --> 45:09.054
Except for the local
Dr. Strangelove

45:09.097 --> 45:11.056
that ate the engine block.

45:11.099 --> 45:12.535
Ask him how real it is now.

45:12.579 --> 45:14.755
CLAY:
Be nice if we could.

45:14.799 --> 45:17.889
Maybe capturing him
wasn't such a terrible idea.

45:29.770 --> 45:30.858
Jace!

45:33.992 --> 45:35.733
-Hey.
-[metallic thud]

45:35.776 --> 45:39.519
This whole "no ranks" bullshit,
it stops right now.

45:39.562 --> 45:41.564
You questioning
my orders earlier,

45:41.608 --> 45:44.089
then you just taking a run at me
right now in front of my team?

45:44.132 --> 45:46.656
You're looking for some
kind of measuring contest,

45:46.700 --> 45:49.485
guess what, buddy,
you're gonna lose.

45:51.270 --> 45:54.186
-That's not what I'm doing.
-Then what exactly

45:54.229 --> 45:56.231
-are you doing?
-I'm keeping this team safe.

45:56.275 --> 45:59.452
That's my job.
I don't need your help, 6.

46:01.062 --> 46:02.716
You know, it's one thing
for an operator

46:02.760 --> 46:06.198
to go outside the wire
and miss the birth of his child,

46:06.241 --> 46:10.724
but to go outside of the wire
when your child is in the NICU?

46:10.768 --> 46:13.683
Your son is fighting
for his life,

46:13.727 --> 46:16.251
and all you care about
is your ego?

46:16.295 --> 46:19.515
Look, I am here protecting
Bravo from you, okay?

46:19.559 --> 46:22.605
Your head is not right,
and it hasn't been for months.

46:25.739 --> 46:28.002
Interesting.
Huh, that's your fucking play?

46:28.046 --> 46:31.353
Stick me with TBI so you have
a clear path to being Bravo 1?

46:31.397 --> 46:33.181
You being compromised
is dangerous for everyone.

46:33.225 --> 46:34.748
You want to know
what's fucking dangerous? Huh?

46:34.792 --> 46:36.794
You threatening
your team leader.

46:36.837 --> 46:39.361
So you better think
long and hard,

46:39.405 --> 46:41.276
right, about what
you're gonna say and do next,

46:41.320 --> 46:43.191
'cause the next time it's not
gonna be a fucking warning.
