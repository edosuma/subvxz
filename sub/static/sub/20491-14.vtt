00:08.801 --> 00:10.067
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE IN
THE BUILDING, JESS.

00:10.167 --> 00:11.801
WHICH WAY?

00:11.901 --> 00:14.901
<i>I'M ONLY GETTING ONE
READING BESIDES YOU GUYS.</i>

00:15.000 --> 00:15.901
WHICH DIRECTION?

00:16.000 --> 00:16.934
<i>UH...</i>

00:17.067 --> 00:19.868
END OF THE CORRIDOR, TURN LEFT.

00:19.968 --> 00:22.434
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON.

00:22.534 --> 00:25.634
THE GUY WE'RE LOOKING FOR
HAS FIVE OF THE DOMINION
COUNCIL MEMBERS.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.501
MAYBE THEY'RE BEING SHIELDED.

00:27.601 --> 00:29.701
NOTHING'S GOING TO SHIELD
THIS GUY... HE'S DEAD MEAT.

00:31.734 --> 00:32.701
GUYS, LOOK OUT.

00:32.801 --> 00:34.767
THE SIGNAL'S RIGHT
AROUND THE CORNER.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.000
<i>VOICE: IF YOU CAN SEE THIS,</i>

00:40.100 --> 00:44.934
<i>IT MEANS THE DOMINION HAS
DECIDED TO IGNORE MY WARNINGS.</i>

00:45.033 --> 00:45.968
JESS, YOU GETTING THIS?

00:46.067 --> 00:47.200
<i>YEAH.</i>

00:47.300 --> 00:48.701
CAN'T TELL WHERE THE IMAGE
IS BEING BEAMED FROM.

00:48.801 --> 00:50.601
<i>VOICE: BY CHOOSING
NOT TO PAY MY DEMANDS,</i>

00:50.701 --> 00:56.033
<i>YOU'VE EARNED
YOUR FRIENDS A FIRSTHAND
EXPERIENCE OF THE PROCESS.</i>

00:58.667 --> 01:00.767
WHAT'S HE DOING TO THEM?

01:04.367 --> 01:07.234
<i>VOICE: YOU KNOW WHAT THE
PROCESS WAS DESIGNED TO DO.</i>

01:07.334 --> 01:10.801
<i>THEIR BODIES
COULD LAST A HUNDRED YEARS
AND STILL BE BROUGHT BACK</i>

01:10.901 --> 01:13.934

AGED A SECOND.</i>

<i>VOICE: OH, DID I MENTION
THEY'RE A BIT BRITTLE?</i>

01:38.300 --> 01:41.367
<i>PAY WHAT I WANT AND THE
OTHERS WILL BE REVIVED.</i>

01:41.467 --> 01:46.868
<i>DON'T, AND ANOTHER ONE WILL
DIE EVERY TWELVE HOURS.</i>

01:49.200 --> 01:50.634
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, SHAL.

01:50.734 --> 01:53.434
YOU COULDN'T KNOW THAT
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:00.434 --> 02:05.100
<i>SCIENTIST ADAM KANE WAS A
PIONEER OF GENETIC RESEARCH,</i>

02:05.200 --> 02:09.133
<i>MANIPULATING DNA TO
SAVE HUMAN LIVES.</i>

02:09.234 --> 02:12.567
<i>BUT IN MANY THEIR GENES
UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED</i>

02:12.667 --> 02:16.200
<i>AND THEY DEVELOPED
SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES.</i>

02:45.200 --> 02:47.667
<i>TOGETHER, FOUR
OF THE MOST POWERFUL FIGHT</i>

02:47.767 --> 02:51.100
<i>TO PROTECT A WORLD THAT
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST.</i>

02:54.334 --> 02:57.033
<i>THEY ARE...</i>

03:01.901 --> 03:04.200
<i>HER NAME WAS MIRANDA DENNIS.</i>

03:04.300 --> 03:05.767
<i>SHE WAS A BRILLIANT PHYSICIST</i>

03:05.868 --> 03:08.434
<i>AND A MEMBER OF THE
DOMINION COUNCIL.</i>

03:08.534 --> 03:11.734
<i>AND THAT COWARD KILLED HER
WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.</i>

03:11.834 --> 03:13.267
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO HE IS?

03:13.367 --> 03:16.834
<i>THERE'S ONLY ONE MAN WITH
THE MOTIVE AND THE KNOW-HOW.</i>

03:16.934 --> 03:20.734
<i>UNTIL SIX MONTHS AGO,
KEITH BURSTYN WAS WORKING
IN A DOMINION-SPONSORED LAB</i>

03:20.834 --> 03:24.801
<i>TRYING TO PERFECT A METHOD
OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION.</i>

03:24.901 --> 03:26.734
WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE
SAW AT THE WAREHOUSE.

03:26.834 --> 03:29.501
<i>ALL THE HOSTAGES WERE PEOPLE
WHO HAD CONTACT WITH BURSTYN</i>

03:29.601 --> 03:32.801
<i>OVER THE TIME HE WORKED
WITH THE DOMINION.</i>

03:32.901 --> 03:34.701
YOU SAID THERE WAS A MOTIVE.

03:34.801 --> 03:38.534
<i>BURSTYN BLAMED THE DOMINION
FOR A PERSONAL TRAGEDY.</i>

03:38.634 --> 03:42.634
<i>HE DISAPPEARED WITH HIS
RESEARCH AND WE'VE HAD NO
CONTACT WITH HIM</i>

03:42.734 --> 03:47.467
<i>UNTIL TODAY,
WHEN HE SENT HIS DEMANDS
FOR THE RETURN OF OUR PEOPLE.</i>

03:47.567 --> 03:49.667
HUH. NICE GUY.

03:49.767 --> 03:53.200
<i>FOR WHAT HE'S DONE,
HE'S A DEAD MAN WALKING.</i>

03:53.300 --> 03:55.033
<i>I GUARANTEE YOU.</i>

03:55.133 --> 03:56.434
WE'LL FIND HIM.

03:56.534 --> 03:59.267
<i>THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE WE
FIND EQUALLY DISTURBING.</i>

03:59.367 --> 04:04.701
<i>THERE HAVE BEEN UNTRACEABLE
COMMUNICATIONS COMING INTO
SANCTUARY OVER THE LAST WEEK.</i>

04:04.801 --> 04:05.834
HUH.

04:05.934 --> 04:08.601
I GUESS BIG BROTHER
REALLY IS WATCHING.

04:08.701 --> 04:10.400
NOTHING SHOULD
SURPRISE ME ANYMORE.

04:10.501 --> 04:13.033
<i>SANCTUARY IS FUNDED
BY THE DOMINION.</i>

04:13.133 --> 04:16.300
<i>WE LOOK AFTER OUR INTERESTS.</i>

04:16.399 --> 04:19.500
<i>YOU'RE SAYING YOU
DON'T KNOW THE SOURCE OF
THESE TRANSMISSIONS?</i>

04:19.601 --> 04:21.166
NO.

04:21.267 --> 04:22.734
BUT I'LL ASK THE OTHERS.

04:22.834 --> 04:24.367
<i>DO THAT.</i>

04:24.467 --> 04:29.767
<i>THE COUNCIL IS OUT FOR
BLOOD, DON'T LET IT BE YOURS.</i>

04:29.868 --> 04:31.501
WELL, I LOOKED INTO
THIS KEITH BURSTYN.

04:31.601 --> 04:35.133
UNTIL SIX MONTHS AGO HE
WAS A POSTER CHILD FOR
SUCCESSIVE GENETICS.

04:35.234 --> 04:38.234
GRADUATED SUMMA CUM LAUDE FROM
MIT, YOUNGEST IN HIS CLASS.

04:38.334 --> 04:42.834
RECEIVED A FELLOWSHIP
FROM THE NATIONAL HUMAN
GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE.

04:42.934 --> 04:46.234
OH, DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THE
KIND OF GUY THAT GETS OFF ON
MURDERING INNOCENT PEOPLE.

04:46.334 --> 04:48.067
WELL, WE'RE NOT HERE TO
PSYCHOANALYZE HIM,

04:48.167 --> 04:50.367
BUT FIND HIM BEFORE HE
KILLS ANY MORE HOSTAGES.

04:50.467 --> 04:52.501
WHY DOESN'T THE DOMINION
JUST PAY THE RANSOM?

04:52.601 --> 04:54.133
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
RESPOND TO DEMANDS.

04:54.234 --> 04:57.100
NOT EVEN FOR
THEIR OWN PEOPLE?

04:57.200 --> 04:59.334
HUH, THEY'RE EVEN
COLDER THAN YOU ARE.

04:59.434 --> 05:02.300
WELL, I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.534
OKAY.

05:03.634 --> 05:05.701
WELL, I'M GOING TO KEEP
LOOKING INTO BURSTYN'S HISTORY,

05:05.801 --> 05:09.734
SEE IF ANYTHING
COMES UP THAT CAN GIVE US
ANY IDEA WHERE HE'S HOLED UP.

05:10.567 --> 05:11.701
HEY, SHAL, YOU OKAY?

05:11.801 --> 05:12.934
NO.

05:13.033 --> 05:14.334
LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT
WOMAN WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

05:14.434 --> 05:15.601
SHE WAS BOOBY-TRAPPED.

05:15.701 --> 05:17.200
IT WAS HIM ALL THE WAY.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.300
JUST BEFORE I TOUCHED
THAT WOMAN,

05:19.400 --> 05:22.334
THE GUY WHO'S BEEN
CALLING ME WAS IN MY COMLINK.

05:22.434 --> 05:23.501
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

05:23.601 --> 05:25.834
HE WARNED ME NOT TO TOUCH HER.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.968
I JUST WISH I KNEW WHO
THE HELL THIS GUY WAS.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.234
WHAT HE WANTS.

05:31.334 --> 05:33.200
OKAY, LOOK, WHATEVER
IT IS, LET'S...

05:33.300 --> 05:35.767
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO GET
HIM TO SHOW HIMSELF. OKAY?

05:35.868 --> 05:37.934
IT'LL ALL MAKE SENSE AFTER THAT.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.501
I HOPE SO.

05:45.734 --> 05:54.434
[Ringing]

05:57.968 --> 05:59.667
WHAT?

05:59.767 --> 06:03.567
<i>I CAN HELP YOU FIND
THE MAN WHO KIDNAPPED THE
DOMINION COUNCIL MEMBERS.</i>

06:03.667 --> 06:07.501
I TOLD YOU, I'M NOT
TALKING TO YOU UNTIL YOU
TELL ME WHO YOU ARE.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.167
<i>ALL RIGHT...</i>

06:09.267 --> 06:12.701
WE HAVE TOO LITTLE TIME.

06:16.868 --> 06:21.000
ADAM?

06:22.367 --> 06:24.701
OH... YOU'RE ALIVE.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.434
IT'S A HOLOGRAM.

06:26.534 --> 06:29.667
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR ME
TO COME HERE IN PERSON.

06:29.767 --> 06:32.901
HOW DO I EVEN
KNOW IT'S YOU?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.734
THE DAY WE MET?

06:34.834 --> 06:36.200
I FOUND YOU HIDING
IN THE ALLEY.

06:36.300 --> 06:39.100
YOU THOUGHT I WAS
LIKE THE OTHERS AND I
WAS THERE TO HURT YOU.

06:39.200 --> 06:44.667
BUT...
YOU LASHED OUT AT ME.

06:46.801 --> 06:49.300
BUT I SAW YOU FALL.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.767
I TRIED TO SAVE YOU.

06:51.868 --> 06:53.601
ECKHART SAID HE
FOUND YOUR BODY.

06:53.701 --> 06:55.567
HE HAS YOUR RING.

06:55.667 --> 06:58.567
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN
NOT TO TRUST HIM.

07:05.033 --> 07:09.000
HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?

07:09.100 --> 07:11.667
YOU LET ME BELIEVE THAT
YOU DIED WITH EMMA.

07:11.767 --> 07:17.601
[SIGHS] LOOK, WE ALL
SUFFERED WHEN EMMA DIED.

07:17.701 --> 07:21.334
BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO BE WITH
YOU ALL MADE IT EVEN WORSE.

07:21.434 --> 07:23.767
YOU JUST CAN'T COME
BACK AND DO THIS TO ME.

07:23.868 --> 07:27.934
SHALIMAR, MY COLLEAGUES WERE
DISAPPEARING, BEING KILLED.

07:28.033 --> 07:30.501
MY SOURCES TOLD ME THAT
I WAS THE NEXT TARGET.

07:30.601 --> 07:32.801
THE EXPLOSION
WAS MY WAY OUT.

07:32.901 --> 07:34.133
YOU COULD'VE TOLD US.

07:34.234 --> 07:35.300
I COULDN'T.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.934
I WOULD'VE PUT YOU IN
THE SAME DANGER I WAS IN.

07:37.033 --> 07:39.467
WHAT DANGER? FROM WHO?

07:39.567 --> 07:41.300
I'M NOT QUITE SURE YET.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.834
BUT SIGNS OF THEIR
ACTIVITY ARE HEATING UP.

07:43.934 --> 07:46.767
THEY MIGHT BE THE ONES
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KIDNAPPING.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.267
YOU SAID YOU COULD HELP US
FIND WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.

07:54.367 --> 07:57.000
I CAN GET YOU TO BURSTYN.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.300
HE'S NOT WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.000
JUST TAKE ME TO THE BASTARD.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.634
I CAN GET YOU HIS ADDRESS.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.734
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME THAT
YOU WILL GO IN AFTER HIM ALONE.

08:07.834 --> 08:11.901
THE OTHERS CANNOT KNOW ABOUT
THIS: MY LIFE DEPENDS UPON IT.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.734
DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS, ADAM.

08:13.834 --> 08:16.534
I WILL TELL THE OTHERS AS
SOON AS I CAN THAT I'M ALIVE,

08:16.634 --> 08:19.167
BUT THIS HAS TO BE BETWEEN US.

08:19.267 --> 08:21.367
I CAN'T DO THIS
BEHIND THEIR BACKS.

08:21.467 --> 08:22.601
ALL RIGHT, SHALIMAR.

08:22.701 --> 08:26.834
IF YOU WANT HIS
ADDRESS, YOU HAVE TO.

08:29.868 --> 08:32.267
CAN I TRUST YOU?

08:32.366 --> 08:34.234
NOW?

08:39.534 --> 08:43.200
I PROMISE: NO MORE LIES.

08:45.667 --> 08:48.367
WE HAVE THE BEST TACTICIANS IN
THE WORLD IN THIS ORGANISATION.

08:48.467 --> 08:49.934
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
THAT THEY DON'T?

08:50.033 --> 08:51.868
I KNOW THAT
BURSTYN IS INSANE.

08:51.968 --> 08:54.467
HE KILLED MIRANDA AND
HE WILL KILL THE REST.

08:54.567 --> 08:58.367
DO YOU WANT THAT
ON YOUR CONSCIENCE.

08:58.467 --> 08:59.734
WE HAVE TO PAY HIM.

08:59.834 --> 09:02.567
I HAVE FIVE EMPTY
CHAIRS AT THIS TABLE.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.767
WE WILL NOT NEGOTIATE.

09:05.868 --> 09:07.701
MUTANT X FAILED.

09:07.801 --> 09:09.100
WHY?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.801
BURSTYN WAS ALREADY GONE.

09:10.901 --> 09:12.567
OUR INTELL WAS FAULTY.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.367
OUR INTELL WAS SOUND!

09:14.467 --> 09:18.767
IT WAS THEIR MISSTEP THAT
GOT MIRANDA DENNIS KILLED.

09:18.868 --> 09:21.300
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT
THE SECRET COMMUNICATIONS?

09:21.400 --> 09:24.033
LEXA PIERCE HAD NO
IDEA ABOUT THE CALLS.

09:24.133 --> 09:25.234
OR SO SHE SAYS.

09:25.334 --> 09:28.200
THERE IS NO REASON
TO DOUBT HER LOYALTY.

09:28.300 --> 09:32.033
THE SAME MIGHT NOT BE SAID
FOR THE REST OF MUTANT X.

09:32.133 --> 09:33.567
WHOEVER IS COMMUNICATING
WITH THEM,

09:33.667 --> 09:35.467
MIGHT BE MANIPULATING
THEM AGAINST US.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.234
TO WHAT END?

09:37.334 --> 09:39.400
THESE GAMES RUN DEEP.

09:39.501 --> 09:42.534
FOR ALL WE KNOW THEY MAY BE
TRYING TO GET TO THE CREATOR.

09:42.634 --> 09:44.234
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.701
NO ONE OUTSIDE THIS ROOM
EVEN KNOWS HE EXISTS.

09:46.801 --> 09:48.667
WE CAN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.834
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO PAY THE RANSOM.

09:50.934 --> 09:55.033
AND WE WILL MONITOR MUTANT
X EVEN MORE CLOSELY.

09:55.133 --> 09:59.868
WE WILL NOT TAKE THE CHANCE
OF THEIR BEING LED ASTRAY
BY THIS UNKNOWN ELEMENT.

10:04.267 --> 10:05.767
HEY, WE HAVE TO TALK.

10:05.868 --> 10:07.434
I'M ALL EARS.

10:07.534 --> 10:10.334
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN
ABOUT THE COMMUNICATIONS
COMING INTO SANCTUARY?

10:10.434 --> 10:11.834
OH, YOU'RE DIRECT, AS USUAL.

10:11.934 --> 10:13.734
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT, THOUGH.

10:13.834 --> 10:16.334
DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE KIDNAPPING OF THE
DOMINION COUNCIL MEMBERS?

10:16.434 --> 10:18.567
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.868
BRENNAN, LEXA!

10:20.968 --> 10:23.367
I LOGGED ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE
INCOMING COMMUNICATIONS.

10:23.467 --> 10:24.601
AND?

10:24.701 --> 10:27.033
IT CAME INTO
SHALIMAR'S TERMINAL.

10:27.133 --> 10:28.367
WELL, DID YOU TRACE THE SOURCE?

10:28.467 --> 10:29.801
NO.

10:29.901 --> 10:32.200
BUT I DID MANAGE TO RETRIEVE THE
CONTENTS OF THE COMMUNICATION.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.400
IT WAS AN ADDRESS.

10:33.501 --> 10:34.901
OKAY, WHERE IS SHE NOW?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.234
SHE LEFT FIVE MINUTES AGO.

10:36.334 --> 10:37.734
OKAY, FEED THE
ADDRESS TO THE HELIX.

10:37.834 --> 10:38.901
I'M GOING AFTER HER.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.434
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

10:41.534 --> 10:43.133
YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
AND YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME.

10:43.234 --> 10:47.000
I AM NOT THE ENEMY
HERE, BRENNAN.

10:47.100 --> 10:50.334
WELL, I GUESS WE SHOULD KEEP
REMINDING OURSELVES OF THAT.

11:09.834 --> 11:12.033
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT, BURSTYN.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.067
I'M NOT COMING BACK.

11:24.167 --> 11:25.634
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO KILL ME.

11:25.734 --> 11:26.868
NOT A PROBLEM.

11:26.968 --> 11:28.267
WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE
YOU KIDNAPPED?

11:28.367 --> 11:29.400
I DIDN'T KIDNAP ANYBODY.

11:29.501 --> 11:30.634
SHALIMAR! DON'T!

11:30.734 --> 11:32.701
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

11:32.801 --> 11:34.601
NO MORE GAMES, ADAM.

11:34.701 --> 11:36.000
I TRIED TO TELL YOU BEFORE.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.334
HE'S NOT WHAT HE SEEMS.

11:37.434 --> 11:38.734
HE'S A SCIENTIST.

11:38.834 --> 11:41.767
HE'S THE GUY WHO
DISCOVERED THE SUSPENDED
ANIMATION PROCESS

11:41.868 --> 11:45.868
AND HE GOT SET UP.

11:47.167 --> 11:48.701
WELL, I'LL MAKE SURE HE
GETS A CHANCE TO PROVE THAT.

11:48.801 --> 11:49.767
NO. WE DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THAT.

11:49.868 --> 11:51.367
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO WORK WITH HIM.

11:51.467 --> 11:54.400
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HELP
HIM FIND A COUNTER-AGENT
FOR THE PROCESS.

11:54.501 --> 11:56.200
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE THOSE PEOPLE.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.167
ADAM, YOU SAID YOU
WERE GOING TO HELP ME.

11:58.267 --> 12:00.434
SHALIMAR'S ALL
THE HELP YOU NEED.

12:00.534 --> 12:03.701
LISTEN, YOU TAKE HIM IN NOW,

12:03.801 --> 12:07.267
FOUR MORE PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO DIE.

12:08.934 --> 12:10.000
ALL RIGHT.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.167
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HURRY.

12:11.267 --> 12:13.501
GO.

12:13.601 --> 12:14.767
DO YOU HAVE A CAR?

12:14.868 --> 12:15.868
IN THE ALLEY.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.300
THEN GO. I'LL MEET YOU.

12:25.167 --> 12:26.601
SHAL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:26.701 --> 12:27.934
BURSTYN'S INNOCENT.

12:28.033 --> 12:29.000
NO, HE'S A MURDERER.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.133
NO, HE'S NOT.

12:30.234 --> 12:31.601
I NEED TIME TO PROVE IT.

12:31.701 --> 12:32.934
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

12:33.033 --> 12:34.501
SHAL, WE'LL SORT ALL THIS OUT.

12:34.601 --> 12:35.868
JUST GET HIM BACK HERE.

12:35.968 --> 12:37.734
SORRY, BRENNAN.

12:37.834 --> 12:40.033
I CAN'T.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.267
SHAL!

12:45.434 --> 12:48.000
NOW YOU WANT TO TELL ME
HOW WE CAN TRUST HER?

13:12.901 --> 13:15.667
THAT'S THE PLACE
HE TOLD ME ABOUT.

13:15.767 --> 13:17.868
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A HIGH
TECH FACILITY TO ME.

13:17.968 --> 13:20.601
THAT MAY NOT BE A BAD
THING FOR US RIGHT NOW.

13:40.267 --> 13:42.033
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

13:42.133 --> 13:45.400
EVERYTHING A MAD SCIENTIST
COULD POSSIBLY NEED.

13:45.501 --> 13:47.801
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE ANY
MORE THAN YOU DO, SHALIMAR.

13:47.901 --> 13:50.901
OH, I DOUBT THAT.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.400
I'VE SPENT YEARS
CLEANING UP THE MESSES THAT
PEOPLE LIKE YOU CREATED.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.167
HEY, I TRIED TO LEAVE
ALL THIS BEHIND.

13:57.267 --> 13:59.834
ALL I WANTED WAS
TO BE LEFT ALONE.

13:59.934 --> 14:03.501
I GUESS WE DON'T ALWAYS
GET WHAT WE WANT, DO WE?

14:03.601 --> 14:06.267
EVER SINCE WE MET, I'VE
BEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE.

14:06.367 --> 14:09.934
IF WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THIS
THING, THAT'S GOTTA CHANGE.

14:10.033 --> 14:13.868
YOU GOOD WITH THAT?

14:13.968 --> 14:16.634
YEAH.

14:18.934 --> 14:21.634
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO'S
BEEN USING YOUR TECHNOLOGY?

14:21.734 --> 14:23.767
WELL, THERE'S PROBABLY
TEN OTHER PEOPLE

14:23.868 --> 14:26.667
WHO WOULD HAVE HAD
ACCESS TO MY RESEARCH.

14:26.767 --> 14:29.334
SOMEONE'S BEEN PLANNING
THIS FOR A WHILE.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.167
DON'T WORRY.

14:32.267 --> 14:34.334
WE CAN WORK IT OUT.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.334
<i>WE NEED TO TALK.</i>

14:42.434 --> 14:43.934
THIS ISN'T A SECURE TERMINAL.

14:44.033 --> 14:45.667
<i>FORGET THE SECURE TERMINAL.</i>

14:45.767 --> 14:50.434
<i>THE COUNCIL KNOWS SHALIMAR FOX
HELPED KEITH BURSTYN ESCAPE.</i>

14:50.534 --> 14:52.501
WE'RE WORKING TO GET THEM BACK.

14:52.601 --> 14:55.000
<i>I WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG
SHE'S BEEN INVOLVED WITH HIM.</i>

14:55.100 --> 14:56.400
SHE ISN'T.

14:56.501 --> 14:58.100
<i>ARE YOU JUST IGNORANT
OF WHAT'S GOING ON,</i>

14:58.200 --> 14:59.734
<i>OR ARE YOU A PART OF IT?</i>

14:59.834 --> 15:02.367
<i>SHE'S BEEN PLOTTING WITH
HIM RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE.</i>

15:02.467 --> 15:04.501
LOOK, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, OKAY?

15:04.601 --> 15:06.434
FOR ALL WE KNOW, HE
MAY HAVE KIDNAPPED HER.

15:06.534 --> 15:10.400
<i>NOW WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.</i>

15:10.501 --> 15:12.133
WE'LL GET HER BACK, OKAY?

15:12.234 --> 15:13.634
BOTH OF THEM.

15:13.734 --> 15:14.968
<i>YOU DO THAT.</i>

15:15.067 --> 15:17.234
<i>THERE ARE FORCES
HOSTILE TO THE DOMINION</i>

15:17.334 --> 15:19.334
<i>THAT ARE TRYING TO TURN
MUTANT X AGAINST US.</i>

15:19.434 --> 15:23.067
<i>THEY WON'T HESITATE TO RIP
THE TEAM APART IN THE PROCESS.</i>

15:25.501 --> 15:27.734
THAT MAY HAVE
ALREADY HAPPENED.

15:30.167 --> 15:32.901
THEY DIDN'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.067
I GUESS THEY JUST NEED
A BIT MORE CONVINCING.

15:48.601 --> 15:53.200
MAYBE THIS WILL HELP
THEM GET THE MESSAGE.

16:00.234 --> 16:03.033
THEY'RE LOSING
FRIENDS BY THE MINUTE...

16:03.133 --> 16:07.801
BIG PROBLEM WITH SUSPENDED
ANIMATION IS ISCHEMIA.

16:07.901 --> 16:09.300
THAT'S THE DAMAGE THAT HAPPENS

16:09.400 --> 16:12.067
WHEN THE CELLS ARE DEPRIVED
OF OXYGEN AT DEATH.

16:12.167 --> 16:15.100
I REALIZED THAT
THE ANSWER WAS TO STEP UP
THE PRODUCTION OF GLYCOSE

16:15.200 --> 16:19.334
WHICH FEEDS THE CELLS THROUGH
THE VITRIFICATION PROCESS.

16:20.534 --> 16:22.434
SORRY.

16:22.534 --> 16:25.567
I USED TO CUT SCIENCE CLASS.

16:25.667 --> 16:28.133
I WISH I HAD TOO, SOMETIMES.

16:28.234 --> 16:30.267
ANYWAY, THE THING THAT ALWAYS
FRUSTRATED ME WAS THE PROBLEM

16:30.367 --> 16:35.267
OF MAINTAINING THE CELLS'
INTEGRITY AS I BROUGHT
THE SUBJECT BACK.

16:35.367 --> 16:41.000
SO YOU NEVER FINISHED THAT
PART OF THE PROCESS BEFORE
YOU DISAPPEARED?

16:41.100 --> 16:47.834
THAT MEANS WHOEVER SUSPENDED
THOSE HOSTAGES HAD NO INTENTION
OF BRINGING THEM BACK.

16:47.934 --> 16:51.400
I WAS ALMOST THERE
WHEN I GAVE UP.

16:51.501 --> 16:56.133
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T STRIKE ME AS
THE TYPE TO GIVE UP ON ANYTHING.

16:56.234 --> 16:59.334
THE REASON I STARTED THIS
PROJECT WAS FOR MY WIFE.

16:59.434 --> 17:01.901
SHE DIED LAST YEAR.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.267
TWO YEARS OF TREATMENTS
AND FALSE HOPES.

17:05.367 --> 17:12.067
I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
IF I COULD JUST SUSPEND HER
'TIL THEY FOUND A CURE...

17:12.166 --> 17:16.300
BUT, I WAS TOO LATE.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.166
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO LET HER GO.

17:18.267 --> 17:21.000
BUT FOR ME THE PROJECT
WAS ABOUT SAVING HER.

17:21.099 --> 17:23.867
DOMINION DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN.

17:23.968 --> 17:26.400
BUT FOR ME, THERE
WAS NOTHING LEFT.

17:26.501 --> 17:29.501
I HAD TO GET OUT.

17:29.601 --> 17:32.334
SORRY.

17:32.434 --> 17:37.167
I DON'T WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES
ANYMORE, SHALIMAR.

17:37.267 --> 17:41.400
WHEN THIS IS OVER, WHEN
THEY HAVE WHAT THEY WANT,

17:41.501 --> 17:46.200
MAYBE I CAN JUST TRY
TO LIVE MY LIFE.

17:47.834 --> 17:52.133
WE'LL MAKE SURE OF THAT.

17:53.467 --> 17:56.434
NOW HOW CLOSE ARE YOU
TO SOLVING THIS THING?

17:56.534 --> 17:59.601
WELL, I CAN BRING
THE CELLS BACK FROM STASIS,

17:59.701 --> 18:01.300
BUT THE PROCESS IS TOO SLOW.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.167
TOO MUCH DAMAGE OCCURS.

18:03.267 --> 18:07.634
I NEED A WAY TO EXCITE
THE CELLS AS THEY REVIVE.

18:07.734 --> 18:10.567
MICROWAVE ACCELERATOR
WOULD HELP THE PROCESS,

18:10.667 --> 18:12.567
BUT THE ONLY ONE I KNOW
OF IS IN A DOMINION LAB,

18:12.667 --> 18:14.901
AND THERE'S NO WAY
WE'D GET TO IT.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.067
I HAVE ANOTHER ONE
- AT SANCTUARY.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.901
OKAY.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.601
YOU DON'T JUST EXPECT ME TO
WALTZ BACK INTO SANCTUARY,
DO YOU?

18:25.701 --> 18:27.434
WE DON'T HAVE AN
OPTION, SHALIMAR.

18:27.534 --> 18:30.033
I'LL CLEAR THE ALARMS AND
OPEN THE DOORS TO GET YOU IN.

18:30.133 --> 18:32.634
YEAH, WELL, GETTING IN
ISN'T WHAT WORRIES ME.

18:49.167 --> 18:50.834
SHALIMAR, OVER HERE.

18:50.934 --> 18:52.667
IT'S THE LONG BLACK TUBE.

18:52.767 --> 18:54.934
BE CAREFUL. IT'S FRAGILE.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.434
BRENNAN!

19:02.434 --> 19:03.434
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:03.534 --> 19:04.767
DON'T TRY AND
STOP ME, BRENNAN.

19:04.868 --> 19:07.334
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS, SHAL.

19:07.434 --> 19:08.767
KEITH BURSTYN'S
BEING FRAMED.

19:08.868 --> 19:10.267
NO, HE'S GOT YOUR HEAD
ALL TURNED AROUND.

19:10.367 --> 19:12.033
THE DOMINION SAYS HE'S
TRYING TO GET TO THEM.

19:12.133 --> 19:12.968
IT'S NOT HIM.

19:13.067 --> 19:15.133
OKAY, THEN
WHAT IS IT?

19:19.601 --> 19:21.667
IT'LL ALL MAKE
SENSE SOON.

19:26.467 --> 19:27.934
GUYS, SHAL'S HERE IN SANCTUARY.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.501
SHE'S HEADING FOR THE HANGAR.

19:29.601 --> 19:30.734
YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

19:30.834 --> 19:32.367
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

19:35.567 --> 19:37.067
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.534
<i>[YELLING]
SHALIMAR!</i>

20:05.534 --> 20:07.434
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DELIVER
HER RIGHT BACK TO US.

20:07.534 --> 20:08.267
SHOULD?

20:08.367 --> 20:09.634
HEY! YOU COULD DO BETTER?

20:09.734 --> 20:11.200
THE KEYBOARD IS YOURS.

20:11.300 --> 20:14.901
SHALIMAR JUST NEEDS
TO TAKE A STEP BACK.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.868
BRENNAN, SOMETHING
ELSE IS GOING ON HERE

20:16.968 --> 20:18.634
AND EVEN I'M OUTSIDE OF IT.

20:18.734 --> 20:19.901
COME ON, YOU KNOW SHALIMAR.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.467
TELL ME, WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:21.567 --> 20:23.234
OKAY, SHE'S BEEN GETTING
CALLS FROM SOMEBODY.

20:23.334 --> 20:25.767
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
IT WAS BURSTYN, OKAY?

20:25.868 --> 20:28.567
YOU BETTER HOPE THAT
I CAN GET HER BACK.

20:28.667 --> 20:29.901
THE DOMINION'S
LOOKING FOR BLOOD

20:30.000 --> 20:33.100
AND RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK
THEY CARE WHOSE IT IS.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.801
OKAY. I THINK I'M IN.

20:40.501 --> 20:41.634
WHAT THE HELL?

20:41.734 --> 20:44.868
<i>ADAM: THEY'RE ENGAGING
THE REMOTE SYSTEM.</i>

20:50.300 --> 20:52.133
I GOT IT.

20:53.701 --> 20:59.534
I'VE LOST CONTROL.

20:59.634 --> 21:00.968
GOT ANY IDEAS?

21:01.067 --> 21:02.033
<i>DROP TO THE SUBSYSTEM.</i>

21:02.133 --> 21:04.300
<i>HIT COMMAND 5-5-0-5</i>

21:04.400 --> 21:07.767
<i>IT'LL CUT OFF
SANCTUARY'S ACCESS.</i>

21:07.868 --> 21:10.701
DOCKING SEQUENCE INITIATED.

21:15.534 --> 21:18.601
HERE GOES NOTHING.

21:21.133 --> 21:23.534
WHA... WHA...
WHAT HAPPENED?

21:23.634 --> 21:24.901
THAT CAN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.234
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

21:26.334 --> 21:27.601
SHE'S OVERRIDDEN MY ACCESS.

21:27.701 --> 21:29.634
SOMEHOW, SHE'S BLOCKED
ALL EXTERNAL ACCESS.

21:29.734 --> 21:31.100
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.868
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE CODES TO
GET THAT DEEP INTO OUR SYSTEM.

21:32.968 --> 21:34.200
WELL, SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO BE HELPING HER.

21:34.300 --> 21:35.434
YEAH, BUT...

21:35.534 --> 21:37.267
WHO COULD'VE GOTTEN
INTO OUR SYSTEM?

21:37.367 --> 21:38.634
THE DOMINION?

21:38.734 --> 21:39.934
OH, PLEASE.

21:40.033 --> 21:41.267
THEY WOULDN'T JEOPARDIZE
THEIR OWN OPERATION.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.734
WELL, HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?

21:42.834 --> 21:44.701
YOU ONLY KNOW ABOUT THE LITTLE
TIDBITS THAT THEY THROW AT YOU.

21:44.801 --> 21:46.567
WELL, MAYBE SHE GOT A
LITTLE HELP FROM THE INSIDE.

21:46.667 --> 21:47.868
HEY!

21:47.968 --> 21:50.534
WE WANT HER BACK
AS BADLY AS YOU DO.

21:50.634 --> 21:51.901
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.267
SHE DID SAY SOMETHING.

21:53.367 --> 21:54.901
SHE SAID THAT BURSTYN
WAS BEING FRAMED.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.400
SO FAR TODAY, SHE HELPED
A MURDERER ESCAPE,

21:56.501 --> 21:58.968
SHE STOLE CLASSIFIED
EQUIPMENT, AND KICKED MY ASS.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.968
SO FORGIVE ME IF I DON'T TAKE
EVERYTHING SHE SAYS AS GOSPEL.

22:01.067 --> 22:02.801
HEY, THIS IS SHALIMAR THAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, ALL RIGHT?

22:02.901 --> 22:04.334
WE NEED TO HAVE A
LITTLE FAITH HERE.

22:04.434 --> 22:05.834
I'M TRYING, BRENNAN.

22:05.934 --> 22:07.601
MAYBE I CAN HELP
YOU WITH THAT.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.367
I'M GOING TO GO TAKE ANOTHER
LOOK AT THE KIDNAPPER'S TAPE,

22:09.467 --> 22:11.067
SEE IF I CAN COME
UP WITH SOMETHING.

22:11.167 --> 22:12.634
OKAY, AND I'M GOING
TO SEE IF I CAN FIGURE OUT

22:12.734 --> 22:14.968
WHAT IT WAS THAT SHE TOOK.

22:21.367 --> 22:22.601
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

22:22.701 --> 22:24.868
I DON'T KNOW IF
I CAN DO THIS.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.601
CAN YOU HAND ME
THE WIRE CUTTERS?

22:30.968 --> 22:32.367
THANKS.

22:36.467 --> 22:40.033
SO, HOW LONG HAVE
YOU WORKED WITH ADAM?

22:40.133 --> 22:42.167
ABOUT TEN YEARS.

22:42.267 --> 22:45.234
FOUND ME LIVING ON THE
STREETS, TOOK ME IN.

22:45.334 --> 22:47.434
HELPED ME COME TO
TERMS WITH WHO I AM.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.000
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

22:49.100 --> 22:50.968
HONORABLE.

22:51.067 --> 22:53.000
I ALWAYS THOUGHT SO...

22:53.100 --> 22:55.667
YOU DON'T ANYMORE?

22:55.767 --> 22:58.267
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO THINK ANYMORE.

22:58.367 --> 23:03.234
UNTIL A FEW HOURS AGO
I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.

23:03.334 --> 23:05.868
EVERYTHING'S SO
COMPLICATED NOW.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.634
YOU KNOW?

23:07.734 --> 23:09.534
WE USED TO HAVE
A CLEAR MISSION.

23:09.634 --> 23:11.300
HELP OTHER
PEOPLE LIKE US.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.767
OTHER MUTANTS.

23:12.868 --> 23:15.434
CLEAN UP THE GENETIC MESS
THEY MADE AT GENOMEX.

23:15.534 --> 23:17.067
AND NOW?

23:17.167 --> 23:21.200
WELL, I GUESS I'M WHERE
YOU WERE WHEN YOU LEFT.

23:21.300 --> 23:25.200
NOT KNOWING THE PEOPLE I WORK
FOR, NOT KNOWING WHO TO TRUST.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.234
NOT REALLY HAVING AN OPTION.

23:27.334 --> 23:29.334
YEAH, THAT'S THE WAY I FELT.

23:29.434 --> 23:34.267
I DID EVERYTHING THEY ASKED ME
TO DO AND IT LOST ME EVERYTHING.

23:34.367 --> 23:36.334
THAT'S WHEN I LEFT.

23:36.434 --> 23:38.567
IT'S NOT THAT EASY FOR ME.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.400
I'M A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

23:40.501 --> 23:44.767
[LAUGHS]
YEAH, I NOTICED.

23:44.868 --> 23:48.100
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.000
[SIGHS]
I'M A FERAL.

23:51.100 --> 23:55.067
AND WHEN I SENSE ANYTHING THAT
THREATENS MY FAMILY, I FIGHT.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.567
I'LL FIGHT TO THE DEATH.

23:57.667 --> 24:02.334
AND RIGHT NOW, IT FEELS
LIKE WE'RE UP AGAINST
SOMETHING THAT'S SO BIG,

24:02.434 --> 24:05.000
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT
WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO
WALK AWAY FROM.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.567
THEY NEED ME RIGHT NOW.

24:06.667 --> 24:10.534
HEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOOD
TO CARE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

24:10.634 --> 24:13.567
BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WHAT YOU NEED, TOO.

24:15.167 --> 24:18.367
IT'S NOT THAT EASY
TO JUST DISAPPEAR.

24:18.467 --> 24:19.634
IT IS.

24:19.734 --> 24:22.934
YOUR LIFE CAN BE
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

24:23.033 --> 24:26.534
WITH ANYBODY YOU
WANT IT TO BE WITH.

24:47.133 --> 24:49.300
SHALIMAR, IF THERE'S ONE
THING I'VE LEARNED,

24:49.400 --> 24:52.868
IT'S THAT YOU
OWE YOURSELF A CHANCE TO FIND
OUT WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

24:52.968 --> 24:57.000
AND YOU GO OUT AND GRAB IT.

24:57.100 --> 25:00.567
YOU JUST THINK ABOUT THAT.

25:04.734 --> 25:07.234
OUR KIDNAPPER TRIED TO HIDE
HIS FACE BY DIGITIZING IT.

25:07.334 --> 25:08.834
NOW, THAT WORKS FINE
FOR SINGLE FRAMES.

25:08.934 --> 25:10.667
WHAT HE FORGOT IS
THAT ONCE IN A WHILE,

25:10.767 --> 25:14.000
THESE SQUARES GIVE AWAY
SPECIFIC POINTS THAT I COULD
USE AS REFERENCES.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.267
WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS
INTERPOLATING THE CLUES

25:16.367 --> 25:18.200
TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.

25:18.300 --> 25:20.968
AND WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE IS...

25:22.334 --> 25:23.601
ANTHONY GERVAIS.

25:23.701 --> 25:25.167
NOW, HE'S A
TOP-FLIGHT GENETICIST

25:25.267 --> 25:27.000
WITH HIS FINGERS IN EVERY
CUTTING EDGE PROJECT GOING,

25:27.100 --> 25:28.667
BUT OFFICIALLY ATTACHED TO NONE.

25:28.767 --> 25:30.300
SOUNDS LIKE A DOMINION PLAYER.

25:30.400 --> 25:33.834
THAT'S PROBABLY HOW HE KNEW
ABOUT BURSTYN'S SUSPENDED
ANIMATION RESEARCH.

25:33.934 --> 25:35.067
YEAH.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.701
SEE WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT
TRACKING HIM DOWN, HUH?

25:36.801 --> 25:38.400
CALL ME IF YOU FIND ANYTHING.

25:38.501 --> 25:40.634
YOU KNOW, ANOTHER PERSON
WOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING
RIGHT ABOUT NOW,

25:40.734 --> 25:43.133
LIKE, UH, I WAS WRONG,
SHAL WAS RIGHT.

25:43.234 --> 25:45.033
SHE STILL DIDN'T HAVE TO
PLAY IT THE WAY SHE DID.

25:45.133 --> 25:46.367
WHY?

25:46.467 --> 25:47.834
BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE GIVEN
HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

25:47.934 --> 25:49.434
HEY, YOU THINK I HAVEN'T?

25:49.534 --> 25:51.133
I'VE BEEN LYING TO THE DOMINION
SINCE THIS WHOLE THING STARTED,

25:51.234 --> 25:52.934
TO COVER HER ASS.

25:53.033 --> 25:54.868
THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

25:54.968 --> 25:57.601
LOOK, ANOTHER ONE OF THE
HOSTAGES DIED ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

25:57.701 --> 25:59.868
THE DOMINION GOT HIS
HAND BACK IN A BOX.

25:59.968 --> 26:02.834
DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND
HOW DANGEROUS OUR
SITUATION IS RIGHT NOW?

26:02.934 --> 26:04.634
I'VE PUT MY HEAD
IN A NOOSE FOR YOU

26:04.734 --> 26:06.601
AND YOU'RE STILL
HOLDING OUT ON ME.

26:06.701 --> 26:08.167
LEX...

26:10.834 --> 26:13.067
THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN,

26:13.167 --> 26:14.901
NOW SHAL'S ONLY
TOLD ME ABOUT THIS,

26:15.000 --> 26:16.801
BUT SHE HAS BEEN GETTING
CALLS FROM SOMEBODY.

26:16.901 --> 26:17.734
WHO?

26:17.834 --> 26:19.133
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW,

26:19.234 --> 26:20.868
BUT THE GUY'S BEEN GIVING HER
INFORMATION ABOUT OUR MISSIONS.

26:20.968 --> 26:22.267
THIS THING'S
GOT HER ALL FREAKED OUT

26:22.367 --> 26:24.434
AND I'VE BEEN HELPING
HER THROUGH IT.

26:24.534 --> 26:25.968
AND YOU COULDN'T TELL ME THAT?

26:26.067 --> 26:27.901
WELL, WE DIDN'T KNOW IF
WE COULD TRUST THE GUY.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
FURTHERMORE, I DIDN'T
KNOW IF WE TOLD YOU,

26:30.100 --> 26:34.434
IF I COULD TRUST
THE INFORMATION WOULDN'T
GET BACK TO THE DOMINION.

26:34.534 --> 26:36.968
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:37.067 --> 26:38.968
THANKS FOR TELLING ME NOW.

26:39.067 --> 26:40.167
BRENNAN!

26:40.267 --> 26:42.100
I JUST TRACKED THE
HELIX'S HOMING SIGNAL.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.434
SHALIMAR DUMPED IT IN A...

26:43.534 --> 26:46.167
IN A FIELD JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

26:46.267 --> 26:47.234
ALL RIGHT.

26:47.334 --> 26:48.634
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO GET IT.

26:48.734 --> 26:50.167
JUST GIVE ME THE
INFORMATION ON THE WAY.

26:50.267 --> 26:52.367
YEAH.

27:04.934 --> 27:08.200
YOU'RE STARTING
TO CARE FOR HIM.

27:08.300 --> 27:10.167
THANKS FOR THE PRIVACY.

27:10.267 --> 27:14.033
[LAUGHS] MAN,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE CONTROLLING
WHEN YOU WERE WITH US.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.734
YOU'RE EVEN WORSE AS A HOLOGRAM.

27:15.834 --> 27:18.634
BOTH OF YOUR LIVES DEPEND ON
WHAT HE ACCOMPLISHES HERE

27:18.734 --> 27:19.968
IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

27:20.067 --> 27:22.467
DON'T LOSE YOUR FOCUS.

27:25.801 --> 27:28.167
YOU THINK IF HE DOES THIS,
THEY'LL REALLY LET HIM WALK?

27:28.267 --> 27:32.300
NO.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.901
WHAT HE KNOWS IS
TOO IMPORTANT.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.167
LOOK.

27:36.267 --> 27:38.667
DOMINION ISN'T THE ONLY PLAYER
WHO WANTS THIS RESEARCH.

27:38.767 --> 27:40.367
AND IF THE OTHER PLAYERS
CAN'T CONTROL HIM,

27:40.467 --> 27:43.234
THEY'RE GOING TO WANT HIS
KNOWLEDGE ERADICATED.

27:43.334 --> 27:44.767
THEY'LL WANT HIM DEAD?

27:44.868 --> 27:47.200
YEAH.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.167
I'M NOT GOING TO
LET THAT HAPPEN.

27:49.267 --> 27:52.534
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO PROTECT HIM.

27:52.634 --> 27:55.100
HUH.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.267
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO
COME BACK, ADAM?

27:57.367 --> 27:59.634
HUH, SHALIMAR...

27:59.734 --> 28:02.634
YOU BREEZE BACK INTO MY
LIFE AND TURN EVERYTHING
UPSIDE DOWN AGAIN.

28:02.734 --> 28:04.801
SHALIMAR, WE'RE GOING TO
FIND OUT WHO'S BEHIND THIS.

28:04.901 --> 28:07.868
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT
IF THEY'RE THE SAME PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO KILL ME.

28:07.968 --> 28:11.033
AND THEN YOUR LIFE IS
GOING TO BE YOUR OWN AGAIN.

28:11.133 --> 28:14.234
WAS IT EVER MY OWN?

28:14.334 --> 28:18.567
HUH, I CAN'T HELP WONDERING
IF MY LIFE WAS ALL PLANNED
OUT FOR ME

28:18.667 --> 28:21.067
BEFORE I WAS EVEN BORN.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.200
YOU KNOW, GENOMEX
WROTE IT INTO MY GENES

28:23.300 --> 28:25.501
ALONG WITH ALL THAT OTHER
STUFF, YOU KNOW, AND...

28:25.601 --> 28:27.400
AND EVERYTHING THAT
I SAY AND DO,

28:27.501 --> 28:29.801
IT'S JUST ACTING OUT WHAT SOME
SCIENTIST WANTED TO HAPPEN.

28:29.901 --> 28:32.868
NO. NO.

28:32.968 --> 28:39.133
YOUR DESTINY HAS ALWAYS
BEEN IN YOUR OWN HANDS.

28:39.234 --> 28:42.501
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE
THAT IT STAYS THAT WAY.

28:48.033 --> 28:50.067
HEY.

28:50.167 --> 28:51.334
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:51.434 --> 28:52.767
GOT A POSSIBLE
LOCATION OF GERVAIS.

28:52.868 --> 28:54.601
IT'S A RESEARCH
FACILITY HE WAS TIED TO.

28:54.701 --> 28:57.467
POSSIBLE LOCATION'S AS GOOD AS
WE'RE GOING TO GET RIGHT NOW.

28:57.567 --> 28:59.534
LET'S DO IT.

29:10.734 --> 29:12.434
OKAY, GUYS, I THINK
WE HIT PAY DIRT.

29:12.534 --> 29:14.000
I GOT SIX READINGS,
THREE OF THEM MOVING

29:14.100 --> 29:15.734
AND THREE OF THEM STILL.

29:15.834 --> 29:17.033
WHERE ARE THE HOSTAGES?

29:17.133 --> 29:18.133
<i>THEY'RE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU,</i>

29:18.234 --> 29:19.634
<i>BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHICH WAY IS FASTER.</i>

29:19.734 --> 29:21.267
OKAY, LET'S SPLIT UP.

29:21.367 --> 29:24.667
WHOEVER GETS THERE FIRST WAITS
FOR THE OTHER BEFORE MAKING A
MOVE, ALRIGHT?

29:24.767 --> 29:26.100
ALRIGHT, GOT THAT, JESS?

29:26.200 --> 29:27.234
<i>YEAH.</i>

29:27.334 --> 29:30.067
<i>I'LL KEEP FEEDING
YOU ANYTHING I SEE.</i>

29:45.234 --> 29:47.067
IT'S A TRAP!

29:47.167 --> 29:49.634
I'M ON MY WAY.

30:03.467 --> 30:06.167
THAT'S FAR ENOUGH.

30:06.267 --> 30:09.067
NICE TRICK, BUT I
WOULDN'T TRY ANYTHING.

30:09.167 --> 30:14.701
IT WOULDN'T TAKE MORE THAN A
TOUCH TO TURN HIM TO POWDER.

30:14.801 --> 30:16.634
HE DIES, YOU DIE.

30:16.734 --> 30:19.400
I HAVE NOTHING
LEFT TO LOSE HERE.

30:19.501 --> 30:20.634
IF YOU'RE HERE,

30:20.734 --> 30:22.934
THE COUNCIL KNOWS I'M
THE ONE WHO DID IT BY NOW.

30:23.033 --> 30:26.567
THERE'S NO GOING BACK.

30:26.667 --> 30:28.701
WALK AWAY.

30:28.801 --> 30:32.334
GET ME MY MONEY!

30:32.434 --> 30:34.434
THIS ISN'T THE END.

30:34.534 --> 30:37.934
NO, BUT IT'S CLOSE.

30:48.734 --> 30:50.367
OKAY, THE SPEED OF THE
REVERSE VITRIFICATION'S

30:50.467 --> 30:52.667
RAMPED TO ALMOST
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.067
THE TRICK NOW IS TO PREVENT
CELL DAMAGE INTRODUCED

30:55.167 --> 30:58.934
BY THE FREE RADICALS WHEN
THE CELL WAS SHUT DOWN.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.734
IT'S A FAST-MOVING
SCAVENGER VIRUS

31:03.834 --> 31:07.000
THAT BONDS WITH THE FREE
RADICALS, STABILIZING THEM.

31:07.100 --> 31:10.868
IF THIS WORKS, IT SHOULD TREAT
THE WHOLE SYSTEM IN SECONDS.

31:23.300 --> 31:25.133
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

31:25.234 --> 31:27.534
IT'S NOT PERVASIVE ENOUGH.

31:27.634 --> 31:31.834
TOO MUCH CELL
DAMAGE IS HAPPENING BEFORE
THE ORGANISM WOULD BE VIABLE.

31:31.934 --> 31:33.667
WELL, SOME OF THE CELLS LIVED.

31:33.767 --> 31:37.000
YEAH, BUT WE HAVE TO
REANIMATE THE ENTIRE ORGANISM
AT THE SAME TIME.

31:37.100 --> 31:40.234
LIPIDS, CELL STRUCTURE, EVEN THE
DNA, ALL HAS TO BE PROTECTED.

31:40.334 --> 31:42.267
YOU SAYING YOU CAN'T DO IT?

31:42.367 --> 31:44.267
I THINK THE ANSWER IS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

31:44.367 --> 31:46.100
I JUST CAN'T SEE IT.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.701
THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY
TO MAKE THIS WORK FASTER.

31:48.801 --> 31:50.567
WE'LL GET IT.

31:50.667 --> 31:53.000
WHATEVER YOU DO, YOU HAVE
TO MAKE IT WORK FASTER.

31:53.100 --> 31:54.701
THEY'VE GOT BRENNAN.

31:54.801 --> 31:59.434
HE'S ONE OF THE HOSTAGES NOW.

31:59.534 --> 32:02.734
I SHOULD'VE BEEN INFORMED OF
GERVAIS'S CONNECTION TO
BURSTYN'S WORK.

32:02.834 --> 32:05.934
THERE WAS NO REASON TO
SUSPECT A COUNCIL MEMBER.

32:06.033 --> 32:08.067
MISS PIERCE SUGGESTS
PAYING THE RANSOM.

32:08.167 --> 32:10.267
WE CAN TAKE HIM
AT OUR LEISURE.

32:10.367 --> 32:12.567
WE WILL NOT
PAY THE RANSOM.

32:12.667 --> 32:15.367
IF BURSTYN HASN'T CREATED
THE REVERSAL PROCESS,

32:15.467 --> 32:17.834
OUR PEOPLE ARE ALREADY DEAD.

32:17.934 --> 32:20.567
SHALIMAR FOX IS WORKING
WITH HIM AS WE SPEAK.

32:20.667 --> 32:22.934
MUTANT X WILL IMPLEMENT THE
CURE AS SOON AS IT'S READY.

32:23.033 --> 32:27.067
WE MOVE ON GERVAIS'S
LOCATION IN ONE HOUR.

32:27.167 --> 32:29.701
AND DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE
TO DO TO FIND BURSTYN.

32:29.801 --> 32:31.601
IT'S ALREADY BEEN PROVEN
BURSTYN'S INNOCENT.

32:31.701 --> 32:33.868
INNOCENCE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

32:33.968 --> 32:35.200
WE NEED HIM.

32:35.300 --> 32:38.501
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO KNOW.

32:45.133 --> 32:48.501
OKAY, HIT THE
PROJECTOR ON MY SIGNAL.

32:56.334 --> 32:58.901
OKAY. NOW.

33:07.634 --> 33:09.000
IT'S WORKING.

33:09.100 --> 33:11.534
LESS THAN.001
PERCENT CELL LOSS.

33:11.634 --> 33:13.601
WE DID IT!

33:13.701 --> 33:16.133
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO FABRICATE ENOUGH OF
THE COMPRESSED SOLUTION

33:16.234 --> 33:19.000
TO REVIVE THE HOSTAGES
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.801
WHAT ABOUT THE
MICROWAVE PROJECTOR?

33:20.901 --> 33:22.133
I CAN PROGRAM IN THE SETTINGS.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.300
ALL YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
IS PULL THE TRIGGER.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.167
IN JUST A FEW HOURS THEY'LL
HAVE THEIR MEMBERS BACK

33:27.267 --> 33:32.067
AND THEY'LL BE OUT OF
MY LIFE FOREVER.

33:34.634 --> 33:37.767
THEY DON'T INTEND TO
LET ME GO, DO THEY?

33:42.534 --> 33:43.634
THAT'S OKAY.

33:43.734 --> 33:45.534
I GOT AWAY BEFORE.

33:45.634 --> 33:47.901
I COULD DO IT AGAIN.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.267
IT WOULD BE EASIER
WITH TWO OF US, THOUGH.

33:51.367 --> 33:54.767
KEITH.

33:54.868 --> 33:59.300
I KNOW HOW YOU'RE FEELING,
AND THERE'S A WAY OUT.

33:59.400 --> 34:02.000
JUST THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

34:02.100 --> 34:04.033
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

34:04.133 --> 34:05.300
OKAY.

34:05.400 --> 34:08.100
COME ON, LET'S GET
BACK AND FINISH THIS.

34:11.501 --> 34:12.734
<i>[RINGING]</i>

34:12.833 --> 34:13.833
WHO IS THIS?

34:13.934 --> 34:14.900
<i>JESS, IT'S ME.</i>

34:15.000 --> 34:15.967
SHALIMAR, WHERE ARE YOU?

34:16.067 --> 34:17.333
I'M ON MY WAY TO WHERE
THEY'VE GOT BRENNAN.

34:17.434 --> 34:19.400
I'VE GOT A WAY TO
REVERSE THE PROCESS.

34:19.501 --> 34:21.132
NO, NO, NO, NO, THAT
IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

34:21.234 --> 34:23.132
LOOK, COME BACK TO SANCTUARY,
AND WE'LL WORK THIS OUT.

34:23.234 --> 34:24.400
CAN'T DO IT.

34:24.501 --> 34:27.033
MEET ME THERE IF YOU
WANT A PIECE OF THIS.

34:30.167 --> 34:31.199
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

34:31.300 --> 34:32.300
WE'RE GOING.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.567
SHALIMAR'S ON HER WAY
TO GERVAIS'S LAB

34:33.667 --> 34:35.567
AND SHE SAYS SHE'S GOT
THE REVERSAL PROCESS.

34:38.167 --> 34:39.934
REMEMBER, YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE
THE GAS TIME TO ACTIVATE

34:40.033 --> 34:41.833
BEFORE HITTING THEM
WITH THE MICROWAVES.

34:41.934 --> 34:43.132
OKAY.

34:43.234 --> 34:44.501
I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO
MY PLACE AND GET MY STUFF.

34:44.601 --> 34:46.199
WHEN THIS IS OVER,
YOU MEET ME THERE,

34:46.300 --> 34:47.667
AND TELL ME WHAT
YOU'VE DECIDED.

34:47.766 --> 34:48.833
OKAY.

34:48.934 --> 34:51.567
I'M NOT GOING TO
LET THEM TAKE YOU.

34:53.167 --> 34:55.067
I'LL SEE YOU.

35:11.601 --> 35:14.033
OKAY, THIS IS THE QUICKEST
ROUTE TO THE HOSTAGES.

35:14.133 --> 35:15.133
WHERE IS SHE?

35:15.234 --> 35:16.400
SHE SAID SHE'D BE HERE.

35:16.501 --> 35:18.567
OH, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
ONE WHO CAN BE INVISIBLE.

35:20.801 --> 35:23.601
LET'S DO THIS.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.634
[WHISPERING]
THERE'S A GUARD.

35:37.734 --> 35:40.868
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO GET TO
HIM BEFORE HE CALLS THE ALARM.

35:40.968 --> 35:42.667
NOT REALLY.

35:51.834 --> 35:52.968
I'LL TAKE CARE OF BRENNAN.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.334
YOU GUYS GO FOR GERVAIS.

35:54.434 --> 35:56.100
COME ON.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.033
PLEASE WORK.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.667
HEY...

36:29.067 --> 36:30.567
YOU OKAY?

36:33.234 --> 36:34.601
YOU CAME BACK.

36:34.701 --> 36:36.100
OF COURSE I DID.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.801
OKAY, DON'T MOVE
TOO MUCH, ALL RIGHT?

36:38.901 --> 36:40.534
I'M GONNA GO
FIND THE HOSTAGES.

36:40.634 --> 36:41.667
OKAY?

36:41.767 --> 36:43.501
YEAH.

37:21.234 --> 37:23.267
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

37:23.367 --> 37:25.834
ALL YOU'LL HAVE TO
WORK WITH IS DUST.

37:25.934 --> 37:27.634
ARE YOU DONE TWIRLING
YOUR MUSTACHE?

37:27.734 --> 37:29.367
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD
WITH HELPLESS HOSTAGES.

37:29.467 --> 37:31.200
YOU WANT TO TRY ME?

37:53.868 --> 37:55.534
WE'VE RECOVERED THE HOSTAGES.

37:55.634 --> 37:56.968
<i>THAT'S GOOD.</i>

37:57.067 --> 37:59.167
<i>OUR MEDICAL TEAM WILL BE
THERE SHORTLY TO PICK THEM UP.</i>

37:59.267 --> 38:01.334
IT'S WAS KEITH BURSTYN'S
DISCOVERY THAT SAVED THEM.

38:01.434 --> 38:02.968
IT CONFIRMS HIS INNOCENCE.

38:03.067 --> 38:06.767
<i>ANOTHER TEAM IS BEING
DISPATCHED TO TAKE BURSTYN
INTO CUSTODY.</i>

38:06.868 --> 38:08.400
WHAT?

38:08.501 --> 38:10.801
<i>WE WORKED OUT HIS LOCATION
FROM A TRANSMISSION A FEW
MINUTES AGO.</i>

38:10.901 --> 38:12.334
YEAH, BUT I FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE COMMUNICATIONS.

38:12.434 --> 38:13.868
THEY WERE FROM BURSTYN
AND WE KNOW HE'S INNOCENT.

38:13.968 --> 38:15.367
THERE'S NO REASON
TO TAKE HIM IN.

38:15.467 --> 38:19.734
<i>STAY OUT OF IT, LEXA,
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.</i>

38:26.000 --> 38:28.400
<i>SHALIMAR, YOU NEED TO
STOP RUNNING OUT ON US.</i>

38:28.501 --> 38:30.067
THE DOMINION'S SENDING
A TEAM AFTER KEITH.

38:30.167 --> 38:31.767
THERE'S PROBABLY
NOT MUCH TIME.

38:31.868 --> 38:33.701
ALL RIGHT, WHEN ARE
YOU COMING BACK?

38:33.801 --> 38:34.801
I DON'T KNOW, BRENNAN.

38:34.901 --> 38:36.667
I'LL CALL YOU.

38:44.067 --> 38:46.634
KEITH! KEITH!

38:46.734 --> 38:48.100
SHALIMAR! IT WORKED.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.534
YEAH. GRAB YOUR STUFF.
THEY'RE COMING.

38:49.634 --> 38:51.534
I'M NOT GOING BACK.

38:51.634 --> 38:52.868
I WON'T LET
THEM TAKE YOU.

38:52.968 --> 38:55.701
IT'S TOO LATE.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.067
GET INSIDE.

38:57.167 --> 38:59.767
BYE, SHALIMAR.

39:01.934 --> 39:05.167
YOU'RE NOT TAKING HIM!

39:07.334 --> 39:09.367
KEITH!

39:23.834 --> 39:28.000
HEY, YOU OKAY?

39:31.534 --> 39:33.300
NOT REALLY.

39:34.734 --> 39:38.834
HE JUST WANTED TO
BE FREE, YOU KNOW?

39:38.934 --> 39:40.968
YEAH.

39:41.067 --> 39:44.934
LOOK, I'M HERE IF YOU NEED
TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING, OKAY?

39:58.968 --> 40:02.334
SHALIMAR.

40:12.968 --> 40:15.367
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID IT AGAIN.

40:15.467 --> 40:21.234
WELL, I GUESS I'M GETTING GOOD
AT MAKING PEOPLE DISAPPEAR.

40:21.334 --> 40:23.434
HOW COULD YOU LET
ME BELIEVE HE DIED?

40:23.534 --> 40:25.000
SHALIMAR, I'M SORRY.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.434
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY.

40:26.534 --> 40:27.734
IT HAD TO BE LIKE THIS.

40:27.834 --> 40:29.067
YOUR BELIEVING HE WAS DEAD

40:29.167 --> 40:33.300
WAS THE THING THAT
CONVINCED THE DOMINION.

40:33.400 --> 40:37.033
I'VE GOT TOO MANY
GHOSTS IN MY LIFE.

40:37.133 --> 40:40.734
ADAM'S SENDING ME INTO
THE MUTANT UNDERGROUND.

40:43.968 --> 40:47.934
YOU'RE GOING TO FINALLY GET
WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.

40:48.033 --> 40:50.000
THERE'S STILL TIME.

40:50.100 --> 40:54.234
YOU CAN COME WITH ME.

40:54.334 --> 40:57.400
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD THAT
SOUNDS RIGHT ABOUT NOW,

40:57.501 --> 41:00.400
BUT, I CAN'T LEAVE.

41:00.501 --> 41:04.868
NOT YET, ANYWAY.

41:04.968 --> 41:10.767
WELL, THERE'LL ALWAYS
BE A WAY TO FIND ME.

41:19.567 --> 41:23.300
WELL, THANKS FOR MAKING
THE RIGHT CHOICES.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.734
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR
DESTINY ISN'T SOMETHING
YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM,

41:25.834 --> 41:28.968
IT'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE RUNNING TOWARD.

41:29.067 --> 41:31.601
YOU WERE RIGHT TO
TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS.

41:34.534 --> 41:36.767
I TRUST YOU.

41:38.801 --> 41:42.601
I DON'T KNOW IF
THAT'S THE SAME THING.

41:42.701 --> 41:46.501
BUT IT SCARES ME THAT I
DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

41:46.601 --> 41:47.767
YEAH?

41:47.868 --> 41:49.367
WELL, IF I'M SUCCESSFUL,

41:49.467 --> 41:53.534
NONE OF US WILL
HAVE TO BE SCARED ANYMORE.

41:53.634 --> 41:55.467
AM I GOING TO
SEE YOU AGAIN?

41:55.567 --> 42:00.534
[SIGHS]

42:00.634 --> 42:03.834
YOU NEVER KNOW.
