WEBVTT

00:00.729 --> 00:01.479
Ok...

00:03.347 --> 00:05.075
The X10's are online

00:05.462 --> 00:11.420
Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal
from this laptop through our local ISP

00:11.540 --> 00:15.573
racing down fibre optic cable at
the speed of light to San Fransisco,

00:15.693 --> 00:18.746
bouncing off a satellite in
geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal,

00:18.866 --> 00:21.686
where the data packets will be headed off
to submerge transatlantic cables,

00:21.806 --> 00:23.492
terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia

00:23.584 --> 00:26.897
and transfered across the continent
via microwave relays back to our ISP

00:27.017 --> 00:30.224
And the extend receiver attached to this...

00:31.209 --> 00:32.069
Lamp.

00:35.048 --> 00:37.095
Look at me, look at me. I've got juice bumps.

00:37.215 --> 00:40.000
- Are we ready for the stereo?
- Go for stereo.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:01.759 --> 01:04.260
- Hey guys.
- Hello.

01:04.631 --> 01:05.966
It's a little loud.

01:06.086 --> 01:07.995
No problem...
Turning it down.

01:08.635 --> 01:12.495
San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax...
...et voilÃ !

01:13.686 --> 01:17.481
- OK, thanks.
- Hang on, hang on. Do you not
realise what we just did?

01:17.738 --> 01:19.870
Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.

01:20.194 --> 01:24.760
No, we turned our stereo down, by sending
a signal around the world via the Internet.

01:26.084 --> 01:28.466
Oh. You know you can get one of those
universal remotes from Radioshack?

01:28.495 --> 01:29.947
They're really cheap.

01:31.297 --> 01:32.973
No, you don't get it.
Howard,

01:33.093 --> 01:36.231
- Enable public access.
- Public access enabled.

01:40.143 --> 01:43.275
- Boy, that's terrific. I'll see ya.
- No hang on, hang on...

01:45.778 --> 01:46.660
See?

01:48.293 --> 01:48.932
No.

01:49.814 --> 01:53.630
Someone in Sichuan province,
China, is using his computer

01:53.750 --> 01:55.262
to turn our lights on and off.

01:56.630 --> 01:58.240
Oh, that's handy.

01:59.608 --> 02:01.593
Here's a question...
Why?

02:03.292 --> 02:05.166
Because we can.

02:06.535 --> 02:08.851
They found our remote control cars!

02:11.365 --> 02:14.674
- Wait, what's on top of that?
- Wireless webcams, wave hello!

02:15.645 --> 02:18.402
The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas,

02:18.522 --> 02:22.091
and the blue Viper is being operated
from suburban Tel Aviv.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.270
- You may want to put on slacks.
- What?

02:30.005 --> 02:33.182
Ew, stop it! No!
Leave me alone!

02:36.667 --> 02:39.358
- Who's running the red Corvette?
- That would be me.

02:45.660 --> 02:49.960
The Big Bang Theory - Season 1 - Episode 9

03:03.200 --> 03:06.597
You know in the future,
when we're disembodied brains in jars,

03:06.717 --> 03:09.421
we're going to look at this as eight hours well wasted.

03:11.340 --> 03:14.627
I don't want to be in a jar.
I want my brain in an android body.

03:15.972 --> 03:17.737
Eight feet tall and ribbed.

03:19.038 --> 03:20.141
I'm with you.

03:20.261 --> 03:23.671
I just have to make sure if I'm
a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish.

03:25.833 --> 03:26.914
I promised my mother.

03:29.186 --> 03:32.715
I suppose you could have
your android penis circumcised.

03:34.766 --> 03:37.975
But that's something your rabbi
would have to discuss with the manufacturer.

03:38.494 --> 03:41.273
Not to mention you'd have to
power down on saturdays.

03:43.303 --> 03:45.621
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?

03:45.741 --> 03:47.318
Well, there's always the possibility that

03:47.419 --> 03:50.319
a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter

03:51.002 --> 03:53.781
but Occam's rasor would suggest
that someone threw it out.

03:54.862 --> 03:57.972
It's from the Institute of
Experimental Physics, they want us to

03:58.031 --> 04:00.224
present our paper on the properties of supersolids

04:00.253 --> 04:03.213
at the topical conference of Bose-Einstein condensates.

04:03.333 --> 04:05.472
I know.
I read it before I threw it out.

04:07.171 --> 04:09.399
Ok, if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question:

04:09.519 --> 04:10.811
why did you throw it out?

04:10.931 --> 04:14.693
Because I have no interest in standing in
the Rose room of the Pasadena Marriot,

04:14.813 --> 04:16.987
in front of a group of judgmental strangers

04:17.107 --> 04:20.450
who wouldn't recognise true genius if
it was standing in front of them giving a speech.

04:21.509 --> 04:23.075
Which if I were there, would be.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.526
I don't know Sheldon.

04:25.527 --> 04:28.901
Those topical conferences on
Bose-Einstein condensates' parties are legendary

04:29.739 --> 04:33.158
- Forget the parties!
- Forget the parties? What a nerd.

04:35.210 --> 04:37.835
Are there any other honours I've got that I don't know about?

04:37.955 --> 04:40.769
Did the UPS dropped off a
Nobel prize with my name on it?

04:41.040 --> 04:44.033
Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way,
but the day you win a Nobel prize,

04:44.153 --> 04:48.233
is the day I begin my research on the drag coefficient of tassles on flying carpets.

04:50.550 --> 04:53.087
the only thing missing from that insult was: "your mama".

04:54.873 --> 04:55.866
I got one...
Hey Leonard,

04:55.986 --> 04:59.290
- Your mama's research methodology is so flawed...
- Shut up, Howard.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.912
- Sheldon, we have to do this.
- No, we don't.

05:02.967 --> 05:05.310
We have to take a nourishment, to expel waste,

05:05.379 --> 05:07.969
and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying.

05:08.051 --> 05:09.476
Everything else is optional.

05:10.521 --> 05:12.549
Ok, let me put it this way:
I'm doing it.

05:12.631 --> 05:14.879
You can't. I'm the lead author.

05:15.071 --> 05:18.729
Come on, the only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically.

05:18.753 --> 05:21.279
I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you

05:21.307 --> 05:23.701
the humiliation with dealing with the fact that it was my idea.

05:23.731 --> 05:26.828
Now to put too fine a point to it, but I was throwing you a bone.

05:27.705 --> 05:28.705
You're welcome.

05:29.226 --> 05:32.679
Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.

05:32.802 --> 05:34.556
That doesn't mean proving.

05:34.844 --> 05:38.229
So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?

05:38.284 --> 05:40.243
They're not supposed to, but they should.

05:41.326 --> 05:42.956
Alright, I don't care what you say.

05:43.011 --> 05:45.327
I'm going to the conference and
I'm presenting our findings

05:45.382 --> 05:47.259
And I forbid it.

05:48.013 --> 05:49.246
You forbid it?

05:49.301 --> 05:51.877
If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is.

05:51.932 --> 05:54.166
- So, you admit that it's our work.
- No.

05:54.234 --> 05:56.303
Once again, I'm throwing
you a bone.

05:57.112 --> 05:58.825
And once again, you are welcome.

06:07.978 --> 06:11.020
So, how's it going with Sheldon?
Are you guys still not talking to each other?

06:11.144 --> 06:12.788
Not only is he still not talking to me,

06:12.843 --> 06:16.159
but there's this thing he does where he stares
at you and  tries to get your brain to explode.

06:18.447 --> 06:21.627
You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie "Scanners"?

06:22.325 --> 06:23.846
Like.... Bzzz.

06:25.669 --> 06:26.875
Nevermind.

06:27.067 --> 06:28.574
How about this one?

06:29.040 --> 06:32.616
It says, I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy.

06:33.288 --> 06:36.426
Oh, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits.

06:36.494 --> 06:38.714
They don't, that's why I saved this one.

06:39.550 --> 06:42.688
Ok, well, let's just see what else you have.

06:43.045 --> 06:44.949
Ok, here. Take this.

06:45.114 --> 06:49.005
and this, and this,
and this, and these...

06:49.101 --> 06:50.787
Is this all stuff you want me to try on?

06:50.814 --> 06:52.623
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.

06:53.774 --> 06:57.389
Seriously, don't even give it to charity,
you won't be helping anyone.

06:58.241 --> 06:59.790
What's this?

07:00.132 --> 07:02.613
That's the bottled city of Kandor.

07:05.477 --> 07:09.492
You see, Kandor was the
capital city of the planet Krypton.

07:09.642 --> 07:12.318
It was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded

07:12.355 --> 07:14.215
and then rescued by Superman.

07:15.370 --> 07:17.398
Oh, nice.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.290
It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.

07:22.231 --> 07:25.456
Here, why don't you put these while I find
a shirt and a sport cut match.

07:25.483 --> 07:26.497
Right, be right back.

07:26.538 --> 07:28.279
Where are you going? Just put them on.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.293
Here?

07:29.361 --> 07:31.101
Oh, are you shy?

07:31.266 --> 07:33.774
- No, I'm not shy.
- Don't worry I won't look.

07:33.938 --> 07:35.623
I know you won't look.
Why would you look?

07:35.672 --> 07:37.145
There's nothing to see...
Well, not 'nothing'...

07:37.187 --> 07:39.638
Sweetie, put the pants on.

07:41.406 --> 07:44.092
So, you know, isn't there maybe
some way you and Sheldon could

07:44.133 --> 07:47.573
- compromise on this whole presentation thing?
- No, No.

07:47.710 --> 07:49.395
Scientists do not compromise.

07:49.423 --> 07:51.512
Our minds are trained to synthetize facts

07:51.550 --> 07:53.437
and come to inarguable conclusions.

07:53.698 --> 07:56.603
Not to mention, Sheldon is back-crap crazy.

07:59.714 --> 08:01.289
What is this?

08:01.426 --> 08:03.386
Oh, careful.

08:03.838 --> 08:07.338
That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.

08:07.798 --> 08:10.032
Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?

08:10.402 --> 08:12.403
Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.

08:15.719 --> 08:17.815
Ok, alright, moving on.

08:17.911 --> 08:20.145
Oh, wow. A paisley shirt.

08:20.186 --> 08:22.858
It goes with my corduroy suit.

08:23.201 --> 08:26.106
if you mean it should end up in
the same place, then I agree.

08:27.504 --> 08:29.655
Is this your only tie?

08:30.696 --> 08:33.573
Technically, yes. But, if you'll notice...

08:34.424 --> 08:36.274
It's reversible!

08:38.438 --> 08:40.124
So it works as two.

08:40.193 --> 08:43.097
Sweetie, I don't even think it works as one.

08:44.904 --> 08:46.566
- Is this all your clothes?
- Eh, yeah.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.483
Everything since the eighth grade.

08:48.606 --> 08:51.429
- The eighth grade?
- My last growth sprout

08:53.553 --> 08:56.623
Ok, well, let's go back to the curdoroy suit.

08:56.664 --> 08:58.610
- Great.
- Yeah.

09:00.281 --> 09:02.128
I said no. Put it down.

09:08.037 --> 09:10.065
Hey Sheldon.

09:10.326 --> 09:11.586
Hello Penny.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.012
Get anything good?

09:16.657 --> 09:20.110
Just the latest copy of
Applied Particle Physics quarterly.

09:20.178 --> 09:23.426
Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.

09:29.209 --> 09:30.785
It was a joke.

09:35.046 --> 09:36.937
Yep.

09:37.143 --> 09:39.596
Tip you waitresses.
I'm here all week.

09:40.610 --> 09:42.747
Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness,

09:42.816 --> 09:46.269
know that I'm perfectly comfortable with
the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.

09:46.516 --> 09:49.051
Oh, yeah ok, me too. Zip it, lock it.

09:51.791 --> 09:52.984
Put it in your pocket.

09:57.382 --> 09:59.890
- So, you and Leonard...
- Oh dear God...

10:00.591 --> 10:02.191
Little misunderstanding, huh?

10:02.718 --> 10:04.040
A little misunderstanding...?

10:04.280 --> 10:07.405
Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.

10:11.069 --> 10:14.894
Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning
and I think he feels really bad about it.

10:17.266 --> 10:18.613
How do you feel?

10:19.978 --> 10:21.429
I don't understand the question.

10:22.879 --> 10:26.187
I'm just asking if it's difficult
to be fighting with your best friend.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.497
I haven't thought about it like that.

10:29.777 --> 10:32.667
I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations

10:32.787 --> 10:35.330
of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil

10:36.726 --> 10:37.755
Wait, what?

10:37.970 --> 10:39.718
I couldn't poop this morning.

10:44.249 --> 10:47.179
You should just talk to him,
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

10:47.558 --> 10:50.336
- Certainly preferable to my plan.
- Which was?

10:50.726 --> 10:52.146
A powerful laxative.

10:54.365 --> 10:56.527
You absolutely should talk to him.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.118
Look, I know Leonard values you
as a friend and he told me himself

10:59.326 --> 11:02.798
without your little idea there's no way
he could come up with this whole experiment thing.

11:07.132 --> 11:08.849
Excuse me. "Little idea"?

11:09.094 --> 11:10.861
Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me,

11:10.981 --> 11:12.640
- I didn't really understand it but...
- Of course you didn't.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.310
He said: "Little idea"?

11:15.858 --> 11:17.564
Oh, well, no...
Not...

11:17.748 --> 11:20.074
- Not in those words.
- In what words then, exactly?

11:20.532 --> 11:23.493
Oh, you know... Gee. The exact words are...
It's more the spirit in which he said...

11:23.613 --> 11:26.034
- What did he say?
- You had a lucky hunch

11:27.887 --> 11:30.031
Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this...

11:30.151 --> 11:32.128
Don't you ever speak to me again.

11:34.700 --> 11:35.711
What...?

11:49.605 --> 11:51.633
Ok, I'm leaving for the conference.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.333
Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch"

11:54.453 --> 11:56.167
Shel, I didn't mean it like that.

11:56.287 --> 11:57.953
- Then why did you say it?
- I don't know, I wasn't...

11:58.073 --> 12:01.822
- Were you trying to impress Penny?
- No, no, not at all. A little bit.

12:03.096 --> 12:04.869
How did that work out for you?

12:05.157 --> 12:08.677
- Leonard, ready to go?
- Libido: 1 Truth: 0.

12:11.537 --> 12:12.810
Ok, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

12:12.930 --> 12:15.460
We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.

12:15.580 --> 12:17.392
And I'm telling you for the last time,

12:17.512 --> 12:20.342
it's pandering, it's undignifying, and bite me.

12:22.731 --> 12:23.736
Let's go.

12:23.974 --> 12:25.856
- Bye Sheldon.
- Goodbye Penny.

12:37.075 --> 12:38.634
One of these days... bshh!

12:42.195 --> 12:43.200
There you go.

12:43.499 --> 12:44.985
You're right this side does look better.

12:45.242 --> 12:48.008
No, no, I didn't say better, I said "less stained".

12:50.122 --> 12:52.997
I just checked the house.
There's probably 20-25 people in there.

12:53.117 --> 12:54.613
- You're kidding!
- Is that all?

12:54.803 --> 12:58.142
"All?"
In particle physics 25 is Woodstock!

13:01.475 --> 13:03.522
- Then good!
- I wasn't expecting such a crowd,

13:03.642 --> 13:04.644
I'm all nervous.

13:04.764 --> 13:06.940
It's ok, just open with a joke,
you'll be fine.

13:07.258 --> 13:09.159
A joke... Ok.

13:10.573 --> 13:12.072
How about this? Um, ok...

13:12.192 --> 13:13.638
There's this farmer

13:13.907 --> 13:17.689
and he has these chickens but they won't lay any eggs, so...

13:18.001 --> 13:19.810
he calls a physicist to help.

13:20.031 --> 13:22.753
The physicist then does some calculations,

13:23.005 --> 13:26.343
and he says: "I have a solution,

13:26.710 --> 13:30.921
but it only works for spherical chickens in a vacuum".

13:33.482 --> 13:34.487
Right?

13:39.333 --> 13:41.422
Oh, sorry, I just had heard it before.

13:42.129 --> 13:45.175
- Let's roll. Hey, nice suit.
- It's a classic, right?

13:46.659 --> 13:49.060
I really should have brought my own car.

13:51.674 --> 13:53.264
So, in conclusion,

13:53.384 --> 13:56.164
the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero,

13:56.284 --> 13:59.783
the moment of inertia changes, and a solid becomes a supersolid,

13:59.903 --> 14:03.924
which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.

14:06.826 --> 14:07.916
Thank you!

14:13.082 --> 14:15.129
- Are there any questions?
- Yeah.

14:15.362 --> 14:17.123
What the hell was that?

14:19.764 --> 14:20.854
Any other questions?

14:21.458 --> 14:26.010
Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am
the lead author of this particular paper.

14:27.698 --> 14:28.733
Thank you.

14:30.745 --> 14:35.138
And you sir, you have completely skipped
over the part where I was walking through the park

14:35.401 --> 14:38.528
and I saw these children on a
merry-go-round which started me thinking

14:38.648 --> 14:41.445
about the moment of inertia in gases like helium

14:41.565 --> 14:43.503
at temperatures approaching absolute zero.

14:43.623 --> 14:46.425
I didn't skip it. It's just
an anecdote, it's not science.

14:46.545 --> 14:49.539
Oh, I see. It was
the apple falling on Newton's head,

14:49.659 --> 14:52.227
- was that just an anecdote?
- You are not Isaac Newton.

14:52.347 --> 14:55.664
No, no, that's true. Gravity
would have been apparent to me without the apple.

14:56.456 --> 14:58.154
You cannot possibly be that arrogant.

14:58.274 --> 15:00.633
You continue to underestimate me,
my good man.

15:01.228 --> 15:05.102
Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation
then maybe you should have given it with me!

15:05.115 --> 15:07.148
As I have explained repeatedly,
unlike you,

15:07.163 --> 15:09.611
I don't need validation from lesser minds.

15:09.641 --> 15:10.459
No offense.

15:11.022 --> 15:12.231
Really, so why did you come?

15:12.246 --> 15:13.687
Because I knew you'd screw this up.

15:13.709 --> 15:15.042
I didn't screw it up!

15:15.055 --> 15:17.470
Oh, please. I admit that spherical
chicken joke,

15:17.492 --> 15:18.481
- that was hilarious.
- Thank you.

15:18.513 --> 15:20.419
But it was straight downhill from there.

15:20.624 --> 15:22.717
I've had enough of your condescendship.

15:22.817 --> 15:25.788
Maybe I didn't go to college
when I was 11 like you.

15:25.801 --> 15:29.286
Maybe I got my doctorate at
24 instead of 16

15:29.306 --> 15:31.013
but you are not the only person
who is smarter than

15:31.026 --> 15:32.420
everyone else in this room!

15:33.800 --> 15:34.410
No offense.

15:36.479 --> 15:38.239
And I am clearly not the only person

15:38.264 --> 15:40.030
who is tormented by insecurity

15:40.049 --> 15:42.157
and has an ego in need of constant validation!

15:42.298 --> 15:43.897
So you admit you're an egotist?

15:44.131 --> 15:44.908
Yes!

15:46.314 --> 15:49.302
My name is doctor Leonard Hofstadter
and I can never please my parents so

15:49.308 --> 15:51.681
I need all my self esteem
from strangers like you!

15:51.793 --> 15:52.782
But he's worse!

15:53.334 --> 15:54.691
Ok, that's it!

15:55.082 --> 15:55.635
Stop it!

15:58.336 --> 16:00.936
You cannot blow up my head
with your mind!

16:01.149 --> 16:02.869
Then I'll settle for your aneurism!

16:03.431 --> 16:05.055
- Stop it!
- You hit me!

16:05.160 --> 16:06.310
You saw that he hit me!

16:06.476 --> 16:07.938
You tried to blow up my head!

16:07.970 --> 16:08.875
So it was working!

16:08.907 --> 16:11.261
It wa... It was not!
You're a nutcase!

16:11.281 --> 16:12.237
We'll see about that!

16:12.382 --> 16:13.730
Heads up, you people in the front row!

16:13.734 --> 16:14.966
This is a splash zone!

16:16.122 --> 16:16.777
Stop it!

16:17.264 --> 16:17.752
Just quit it!

16:23.913 --> 16:26.153
Is this usually how these physics things go?

16:26.600 --> 16:27.839
More often than you think.

16:44.454 --> 16:46.239
You could have offered me a ride home.

16:48.171 --> 16:49.911
You're lucky I didn't run you over.

16:51.014 --> 16:52.900
I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about.

16:52.913 --> 16:54.563
You begged me to come, I came.

16:54.591 --> 16:55.766
There's just no pleasing you.

16:56.771 --> 16:59.325
You're right, I'm the problem,
I'm the one that needs help.

16:59.794 --> 17:02.002
Well, that's not much of
an apology but I'll take it.

17:03.187 --> 17:04.400
Excuse me,

17:04.939 --> 17:07.212
is there anything you would apologise for?

17:08.810 --> 17:09.425
Yes.

17:10.566 --> 17:12.723
I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.

17:14.693 --> 17:15.797
It was uncalled for.

17:17.241 --> 17:18.217
You won't believe this.

17:18.242 --> 17:20.698
Somebody got the whole thing with their
cell phone and put it on YouTube!

17:22.303 --> 17:22.885
What?

17:24.578 --> 17:26.826
- Who would do that?
- That would be me.

17:28.622 --> 17:30.324
Hey, check it out,
it's a featured video!

17:30.426 --> 17:32.352
<i>He hit me!
You saw that he hit me!</i>

17:32.384 --> 17:33.405
<i>You tried to blow up my head!</i>

17:33.444 --> 17:36.415
<i>- Then it was working!
- It was not working! You're a nutcase!</i>

17:36.441 --> 17:37.456
<i>We will see about that!</i>

17:37.507 --> 17:38.788
<i>You people in the front row
heads up!</i>

17:38.801 --> 17:40.072
<i>This is splash zone</i>

17:41.663 --> 17:44.257
<i>Stop it! Leave it,
leave it!</i>

17:47.758 --> 17:49.293
<i>You want a volcano nerve pinch!</i>

17:50.939 --> 17:53.381
<i>You should clip your fingernails!
Those hurt!</i>

17:54.939 --> 17:58.070
Oh, Jeez. does this suit really look that bad?

17:59.197 --> 18:01.056
Forget your suit,
look at my arms waving.

18:01.062 --> 18:02.687
I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.

18:05.812 --> 18:06.499
Howard,

18:06.727 --> 18:09.156
would you like to explain to me
why your Facebook page

18:09.172 --> 18:11.445
has a picture of me sleeping
on your shoulder

18:11.461 --> 18:12.906
captioned "me and my girlfriend"?

18:15.252 --> 18:17.274
Uh oh, here comes
the talk.

18:26.308 --> 18:28.068
- You hit me!
- You tried to blow up my head!

18:28.109 --> 18:31.107
- So it was working!
- It was not working! You're a nutcase!

18:31.146 --> 18:32.089
We will see about that!

18:33.305 --> 18:39.940
