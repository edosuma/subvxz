00:02.869 --> 00:05.269
<i>On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-Air:</i>

00:05.438 --> 00:06.905
This is one of the last times...

00:07.073 --> 00:10.236
...that we'll all be sitting together
around this table for a while.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.935
We should cherish these few moments
we have as a family.

00:13.113 --> 00:14.478
Oh. Not to worry, Big Guy.

00:14.647 --> 00:18.048
Will's gonna be sitting around this table
for years to come.

00:18.251 --> 00:22.085
For your information, midget boy,
I already got an apartment.

00:22.255 --> 00:24.553
I have, uh, a little announcement
to make myself.

00:26.092 --> 00:29.459
I have decided to move back to London
to be near my son Frederick.

00:29.629 --> 00:33.690
What would you say if I said
I think I may have made a mistake?

00:33.867 --> 00:38.065
The word "duh" comes to mind.

00:38.304 --> 00:39.965
In light of all the changes afoot...

00:40.140 --> 00:42.870
...your mother and I
have decided to change too.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.238
We're gonna sell the house.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.828
Come on, Will.
Early bird catches the worm.

02:15.034 --> 02:18.231
Sound like that's what got caught
in your throat.

02:18.738 --> 02:21.172
So, Will, you haven't told me
about your new place.

02:21.341 --> 02:23.707
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
Uh, you know, I'm moving in soon.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.243
You know,
right now they putting a Jacuzzi in...

02:26.412 --> 02:28.778
...and they getting the mirrors
on the roof.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.441
So what, it's kind of a fixer-upper?

02:32.619 --> 02:36.316
Oh, no, no. No, not at all, man.
Yo, this place is huge.

02:36.489 --> 02:42.428
I mean, we got floor-to-ceiling walls
and wall-to-wall floors.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.194
Man, yo, it's the bomb.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.662
Look, since Mom and Dad
are selling the place...

02:46.833 --> 02:48.767
...I don't wanna take all my stuff
to Princeton.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.664
Can I leave some of it
in your apartment?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.031
Pfft. Ooh, uh...

02:52.205 --> 02:55.197
No, I can't do that.
See, uh, my place kind of small, man.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.838
I thought you just said it was big.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.105
Yeah. No. Yeah. No.

03:01.447 --> 03:06.111
I mean, uh,
it's big in a real petite kind of way.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.052
Ah. I know what this is.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.958
- You do?
- Separation anxiety.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.856
You can't bear to have reminders of me
in your new place.

03:16.396 --> 03:20.423
Oh, come here, you big lug.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.294
Will, don't hide your emotions.

03:24.470 --> 03:28.429
Look, Carlton,
I don't have no separation anxiety.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.702
I got no-apartment anxiety.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.438
Oh, someone's hiding
their true feelings.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.514
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.878
Carlton, stop. Carlton, stop.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.952
I don't have an apartment.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.885
What?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.548
Yeah. I never had one.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.324
Why'd you lie?

03:50.496 --> 03:53.954
I don't know, man.
Y'all was all going on with your stuff.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.363
Look, I just did. Whatever.

03:56.536 --> 04:00.199
Look, Will, I'm sorry. When I gave you
a hard time earlier about frittering...

04:00.373 --> 04:02.307
...I didn't mean anything by it.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.267
Yeah, I know.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.979
It's just that you was right.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.681
Look, Will,
why don't you move back East with us?

04:10.850 --> 04:12.818
You could transfer to a school
in New York.

04:12.986 --> 04:16.285
<i>You could take the job on the Hilary
Show, you could be near the family.</i>

04:16.456 --> 04:18.219
Come on,
just make it easy on yourself.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.654
Carlton,
I don't wanna make it easy on myself.

04:20.827 --> 04:24.024
I came out here to go to school
and that's what I'm gonna do. Period.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.188
I started it and I'm gonna finish it.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.800
Look,
I just need to get myself situated.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.095
So, what are you gonna do?

04:34.407 --> 04:36.272
Gotta get out there
and look for a place.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.138
You know what?
Dad could help you out in a minute.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.075
- I'm gonna go...
- Carlton, no. Carlton.

04:41.247 --> 04:43.738
No, I don't want Uncle Phil
to know nothing about this.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.406
Why? That's dumb.

04:45.585 --> 04:50.613
Carlton, I do not need Uncle Phil
to clean up all my messes. No.

04:50.790 --> 04:54.385
You are gonna swear to me right now,
you ain't gonna say nothing to nobody.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.458
Okay, Will. I swear.

05:00.900 --> 05:04.563
Hello, Master William, you're back early.
How's the apartment hunt going?

05:04.737 --> 05:07.535
Pfft. Please, don't ask.
Where's everybody at?

05:07.707 --> 05:10.574
They're gone. We're showing
the house today, remember?

05:10.743 --> 05:12.734
Oh, right.
What are you still doing here?

05:12.912 --> 05:15.938
That's a question that haunts me
every day.

05:16.249 --> 05:19.480
Actually, I'm here to answer questions
about the house.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.580
That is not your job.

05:22.755 --> 05:25.019
There they go abusing you again.

05:25.191 --> 05:30.094
I mean, I love them but it hurts me
so bad the way they treat you.

05:32.298 --> 05:35.699
G, you go ahead get out of here, man.
I'll take care of it.

05:36.869 --> 05:38.393
You will do your best?

05:39.405 --> 05:42.033
What would make me happier
than selling the house?

05:42.208 --> 05:44.199
Not selling the house?

05:47.380 --> 05:49.177
Yep.

06:01.327 --> 06:05.024
You know,
this looks like a great place, Arnold.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.065
- Yeah, Willis would love it.
- Yeah.

06:08.601 --> 06:13.504
Yeah, that is if he wouldn't mind living
over a haunted Indian burial ground.

06:14.407 --> 06:15.999
Who are you?

06:16.175 --> 06:18.370
Hey, I'm Will Smith. I'm the Realto.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.445
At night,
you can hear the wailing of the dead.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.876
What you talking about, Will?

06:32.058 --> 06:34.526
I think he's overstating it a little bit,
Arnold.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.629
You're probably right, Dad.
Let's check out this fly pad.

06:37.797 --> 06:40.231
I could get used
to living in the lap of luxury.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.837
You know, those things were a lot
funnier when you were still a little child.

06:45.772 --> 06:51.108
Yeah, well, Dad, your little stories were
a lot more interesting back then too.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.709
Hey, let's check out the wet bar.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.406
Oh, wait, wait. Uh, we don't have one.

06:58.317 --> 07:01.150
Let's check out the house
down the street.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.311
Thanks anyway.

07:05.725 --> 07:07.192
<i>Yes.</i>

07:09.429 --> 07:12.626
And this is the living room.

07:19.372 --> 07:20.361
Come on, shake a leg.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.407
<i>We gotta get to the Universal Tour
and see the Backdraft ride.</i>

07:23.576 --> 07:27.068
Oh, then you should probably leave now
before the fire goes out.

07:27.246 --> 07:30.613
Oh, believe me, Will.
The fire went out a long time ago.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.053
Oh, George, this place is beautiful.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.189
I'm telling you, Weezy,
we can't afford it.

07:37.356 --> 07:38.983
How can you say that?

07:39.158 --> 07:41.558
Easy. He's cheap.

07:45.865 --> 07:49.426
If I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut.
Out here, there are a lot of people...

07:49.602 --> 07:52.264
...crossing the border
to get a job like yours.

07:52.438 --> 07:57.171
One look at a bald-headed miser like you,
they'll be crossing right back over.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.147
I'm telling you, Weezy,
it's too expensive.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.910
Oh, loosen up, George. I like it.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.952
Oh, yeah, and let me tell you.
Next door, ooh, the girls, man.

08:09.121 --> 08:10.349
Bikinis all that.

08:10.523 --> 08:14.687
They got a regular Playboy mansion
jumping off over there.

08:14.861 --> 08:18.820
Memorial Day, it all comes off,
you know what I'm talking about?

08:18.998 --> 08:21.330
- You know what I'm talking about, boy?
- Ha, ha!

08:26.706 --> 08:31.143
Come on, George.
This place is too expensive.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.972
- It all comes off, huh?
- Man, let me tell you...

08:34.145 --> 08:35.909
George!

08:44.824 --> 08:47.088
- Hey, hey, what's up, y'all?
- Hey, Will.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.228
Sir, it's the Realto.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.295
Now, don't get your hopes up,
Uncle Phil.

08:51.464 --> 08:54.627
I mean, it could take weeks or months,
even years to sell a house.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.267
Yeah?

08:57.803 --> 09:00.397
Great. Okay. Bye-bye.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.806
- We have a buyer.
What?

09:03.976 --> 09:07.207
- That's fantastic.
- A couple. The Jeffersons.

09:08.347 --> 09:11.111
There's only one catch.
We have to be out in a week.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.615
Why such a rush?

09:12.785 --> 09:16.186
Something about being in
by Memorial Day and it all coming off.

09:21.994 --> 09:23.985
We can't possibly be out in seven days.

09:24.196 --> 09:27.222
I mean, we have to organize,
we have to pack, we have to move.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.528
I mean, Geoffrey only has two hands.

09:31.837 --> 09:34.397
Our apartment's not even ready.
Where are we gonna live?

09:34.574 --> 09:37.407
And my dorm room's not ready.
And what about Will?

09:37.577 --> 09:39.943
Oh, Will's set, huh?

09:42.782 --> 09:46.741
I have an idea. Why don't we check
into the Plaza Hotel?

09:46.919 --> 09:48.978
Or perhaps the Hilton. Ha, ha.

09:50.456 --> 09:51.980
Good one, Daddy.

09:52.158 --> 09:56.390
All right, all right, we'll stay at the Plaza.
Let's crack open a bottle of champagne.

09:56.562 --> 09:58.587
- Ooh, champagne.
- Girl.

10:02.368 --> 10:03.858
So, Will, what are you gonna do?

10:04.036 --> 10:07.597
Hey, hey, hey, no need to stress, C.
I mean, I still got seven days.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.207
God built the whole universe
in that much time.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.140
He had better credit.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.645
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, no.
Yeah, yeah. No, no.

10:21.821 --> 10:23.880
I mean,
I know I don't have any references...

10:24.056 --> 10:29.084
...and I don't have any credit, but that
isn't necessarily a bad thing, is it?

10:29.261 --> 10:30.922
Oh, it is? Ha, ha.

10:31.097 --> 10:34.999
Well... Get the... Ha, ha... Hello? Hello?

10:38.738 --> 10:41.298
I cannot believe it's that hard
to rent an apartment.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.341
Yes, to think that all landlords
wouldn't jump at the chance...

10:44.510 --> 10:47.968
...to rent to somebody with no job,
no references, no credit.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.778
It's because I'm black, ain't it?

10:55.554 --> 10:58.022
Hey, Will. How's your apartment?
Is everything set up?

10:58.190 --> 11:00.249
Oh, yeah. It's cool, Uncle Phil.
Thanks. All set.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.122
- Okay.
- I haven't seen it. Has anyone?

11:03.295 --> 11:07.561
Oh, well, from...
When I took the, um...

11:07.733 --> 11:09.257
Yeah, yeah. I have.

11:09.435 --> 11:11.062
Oh, what does it look like?

11:11.237 --> 11:17.540
Well, it's wall-to-wall doors
and floor-to-ceiling floors.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.539
It's neat. It makes this place look tiny.
Ha, ha.

11:21.714 --> 11:25.650
Ahem. You know, I think Carlton's
just bragging a little too much.

11:25.818 --> 11:28.719
- I wanna see it.
- We'd all like to see it.

11:29.722 --> 11:32.156
Um, well, you can't.

11:32.558 --> 11:35.026
Because it's tented.

11:46.405 --> 11:51.365
Look, C... No, you can't
because I don't have an apartment.

11:53.279 --> 11:56.806
It's a condo is what it is.

11:59.852 --> 12:03.811
Look, that's all right.
That's all right, C.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.784
Um, I don't have an apartment...

12:09.462 --> 12:11.692
...and I never had one.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.993
Would you excuse us for a minute,
please?

12:18.471 --> 12:20.405
I'm sorry, Will.

12:24.610 --> 12:26.874
What the hell is going on?

12:27.046 --> 12:30.106
Look, um, Uncle Phil,
this is not really your concern.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.614
You know, it's about me,
it's not about you.

12:32.785 --> 12:35.754
- So don't even worry about it, all right?
- How can you say that?

12:35.921 --> 12:40.017
We are leaving town in a day
and you don't have a place to live.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.222
Why did you lie?

12:46.398 --> 12:49.697
I mean, we sitting around the table
and everybody talking about...

12:49.869 --> 12:52.770
...all these great lives
and these new things they're doing.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.098
I didn't want you to say:

12:54.273 --> 12:58.209
"Hey, there's my nephew.
Yeah, he's still living in my pool house."

12:58.444 --> 12:59.775
I didn't want you to think...

12:59.945 --> 13:03.676
...that all these years that I've been
out here just ain't worth nothing.

13:03.883 --> 13:07.182
You know, that you just been wasting
your time with me.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.553
Look, Uncle Phil,
I just don't want you to think...

13:10.723 --> 13:14.386
...that I'm that same stupid kid I was
when I first moved out here.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.496
How could you possibly believe that
that's what I'd be thinking? Look at you.

13:19.598 --> 13:23.034
You're moving out on your own.
You're gonna finish college in a year.

13:23.903 --> 13:26.371
You're becoming a man.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.537
A man I'm damn proud of.

13:32.344 --> 13:36.838
I just didn't want your last memory
of me to be no better than the first one.

13:37.616 --> 13:40.141
You have no idea
what my first memory of you is.

13:42.054 --> 13:47.321
I remember a kid loaded
with all the potential in the world.

13:48.394 --> 13:52.626
And now I see a person on the verge
of realizing that potential.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.562
Come on,
let's go get you an apartment.

14:04.210 --> 14:07.077
Hey, Uncle Phil, um...

14:07.246 --> 14:10.409
...what you mean by verge?
- Don't push your luck.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.280
Oh, wait, check this out. I didn't know
I had two Biggie Smalls CDs.

14:17.456 --> 14:19.788
Oh. One of them is mine.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.727
You own a Biggie Smalls CD?

14:22.895 --> 14:26.353
Well, you know,
I'd like to think of myself as with it.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.124
Yeah, look at you, boy.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.565
Six years, you couldn't fight the flood,
could you?

14:32.304 --> 14:36.866
<i>Wait a minute. I know I don't own
two What's New Pussycats?</i>

14:38.110 --> 14:41.273
I don't know why we standing here
talking. We gotta get packed, man.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.577
You know, Will...

14:48.020 --> 14:50.989
...this is the last time
we'll ever live together.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.186
Yeah.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.086
We've been through a lot together.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.990
Childhood to manhood.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.957
It's been a good trip.

15:03.435 --> 15:05.801
It's been a great trip.

15:06.538 --> 15:12.204
Look, whenever, wherever,
I got your back, C.

15:13.512 --> 15:18.142
Whenever, wherever,
I've got your back, W.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.822
That just doesn't sound right
coming from me, does it?

15:25.257 --> 15:27.191
Sounds great, man.

15:36.735 --> 15:38.760
You know what?

15:39.638 --> 15:40.866
What are you doing?

15:41.040 --> 15:44.908
Oh, no, no. You got to do it.
One last time for me, man.

15:56.255 --> 16:00.191
<i>It's not unusual to be loved by anyone</i>

16:01.493 --> 16:05.293
<i>It's not unusual to have fun with anyone</i>

16:06.999 --> 16:11.595
<i>But when I see you hanging about
With anyone</i>

16:11.770 --> 16:16.104
<i>It's not unusual to see me cry</i>

16:16.275 --> 16:18.402
<i>I wanna die</i>

16:19.678 --> 16:23.170
<i>It's not unusual to go out at any time</i>

16:24.783 --> 16:28.776
<i>But when I see you out and about
It's such a crime</i>

16:29.922 --> 16:33.517
<i>If you should ever wanna
Be loved by anyone</i>

16:35.194 --> 16:39.221
<i>It's not unusual
It happens every day</i>

16:39.398 --> 16:41.298
<i>No matter what you say</i>

16:50.776 --> 16:53.506
Wow, it's so empty.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.941
It's kind of creepy.

16:55.114 --> 16:58.641
Uh, maybe you kids should take another
look around before the car comes.

16:58.817 --> 17:00.375
All right.

17:08.827 --> 17:13.127
- Lot of good times in this house, huh?
- A lifetime's worth.

17:17.403 --> 17:18.461
You okay?

17:18.637 --> 17:21.571
Yeah, yeah. No, no.
I'm cool. I'm cool, Uncle Phil.

17:21.740 --> 17:24.834
You know, it's just
when I first came out here, you know...

17:25.010 --> 17:27.035
...I was a relative.

17:27.212 --> 17:31.342
But for the past six years,
it's like we've been family.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.444
I just don't wanna go back
to being just a relative again.

17:37.956 --> 17:40.220
I mean, I lived without a father...

17:40.392 --> 17:43.259
...and without brothers and sisters
and all of that.

17:44.763 --> 17:47.129
I like this life better.

17:48.033 --> 17:51.867
I want you to call me on Sundays too
when you're calling all your other kids.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.605
Look, um...

17:58.043 --> 18:01.843
...I love you, Uncle Phil, and I just don't
wanna lose you, you know, any of you.

18:03.549 --> 18:05.744
You're not gonna lose us.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.946
You are my son, Will.

18:08.954 --> 18:11.184
End of story.

18:11.356 --> 18:14.291
You just better be sure that your butt
is by a phone on Sunday.

18:15.060 --> 18:16.823
You got it, man.

18:23.402 --> 18:25.597
The car to the airport has arrived.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.830
Nicky, did you remember
to go to the bathroom?

18:28.006 --> 18:29.303
- Of course.
- Good.

18:29.475 --> 18:32.774
- Carlton, did you remember to go?
- Of course.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.374
I'll be right back.

18:38.717 --> 18:40.708
Well, Geoffrey...

18:41.086 --> 18:42.553
...this is it.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.848
You are officially off duty.

18:45.023 --> 18:46.888
Yes! Ha-ha-ha!

18:48.894 --> 18:50.828
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

18:51.830 --> 18:56.290
Well, I've taken the liberty of upgrading
your ticket to London to first class.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.669
Why, thank you, sir.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.498
In lieu of my spring bonus?

19:00.706 --> 19:02.435
In addition to it.

19:03.775 --> 19:06.175
I'm getting lightheaded.

19:08.213 --> 19:11.580
Will, honey, remember, you're
coming out as soon as you get settled.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.615
Yeah, yeah.

19:15.787 --> 19:17.755
You're gonna love the Plaza.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.891
Come on now,
the plane leaves in an hour.

19:20.058 --> 19:22.151
Bye, Will.
- Bye-bye, Nick.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.454
Hey, you remember what I told you,
all right?

19:24.630 --> 19:27.622
Never give Dad any bad news
when he's hungry.

19:31.737 --> 19:36.834
No, man. I said, you know,
always be good to your mom and dad.

19:37.075 --> 19:38.406
And that other thing.

19:39.778 --> 19:41.905
Oh. Mwah.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.707
Come on, baby.

19:43.882 --> 19:46.407
Remember,
if you decide to drop out of school...

19:46.585 --> 19:49.816
...I have a job waiting for you,
and I'll make it worth your while.

19:49.988 --> 19:52.149
Hilary, Will's gonna finish school.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.048
Oh, I know.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.290
I'll save a desk for you, just in case.
Ha, ha.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.127
- Goodbye.
- I love you.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.467
- I love you, Will.
- I love you too, Ash.

20:16.248 --> 20:19.217
Don't be acting all wild in New York.

20:19.785 --> 20:22.720
Geoffrey,
could you help me with my bag?

20:25.924 --> 20:27.289
Just kidding.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.531
It would be my pleasure.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.937
- Goodbye, Master William.
- Hey, hey, hey. What's that, G?

20:50.382 --> 20:54.011
Goodbye, Will.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.920
Bye-bye, G.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.857
So, uh, when is Jazz coming by
to help you move?

21:07.032 --> 21:10.559
- Uh, he's coming as soon as you leave.
- Ah. Good idea.

21:11.770 --> 21:15.706
Well, when he comes by,
wish him all the best for me.

21:17.542 --> 21:18.600
I will.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.053
Sunday.

21:31.523 --> 21:33.320
Sundays.

22:04.956 --> 22:08.016
Hey, who turned out the lights?

22:09.661 --> 22:12.152
Where is everybody?

22:20.305 --> 22:23.468
I am definitely gonna miss you, C.
