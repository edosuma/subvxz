09:32.005 --> 09:34.272
- People, relax.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.174
We are killing it online.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.642
Have you guys
checked the comments?

09:37.644 --> 09:39.010
Smokethatskinwagon says,

09:39.012 --> 09:41.646
"you guys are killing it."
I mean...

09:41.648 --> 09:44.716
We're internet sensations,
guys.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.284
- I think we need to figure out
what's going on.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.087
I might just take
a little walk.

09:49.089 --> 09:53.191
- Yes, a little walk
sounds like a good idea.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.260
- Okay.

09:57.363 --> 10:01.600
[indistinct whispering]

10:01.602 --> 10:03.168
- Okay, everyone,
turn off your mics.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.210
- We need to know more.
Did those shots have sound?

10:12.212 --> 10:14.179
What exactly did they get
on tape?

10:14.181 --> 10:16.615
- I sneezed into my hands
without using purell

10:16.617 --> 10:17.849
And then dipped
into the candy jar.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.351
Did they film that?
- My first week here,

10:19.353 --> 10:21.019
I sneezed directly
into the candy jar

10:21.021 --> 10:22.387
Because I thought
I'd get more--

10:22.389 --> 10:24.222
I thought I'd get
more screen time as a villain.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.257
- Okay, pam, why don't you
visit your buddy,

10:26.259 --> 10:28.326
The crew guy that got fired,
find out what they got?

10:28.328 --> 10:29.995
- Brian?

10:29.997 --> 10:32.097
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I guess I could.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.165
- Hurry, pam.
I need to know how much hellfire

10:34.167 --> 10:35.767
Is gonna rain down on me.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.235
- I thought teri knew
about cynthia.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.704
- She does, but neither of them
know about lydia.

10:39.706 --> 10:42.107
- Ooh.
- Wow.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.877
- Whoa!
[laughter]

10:45.879 --> 10:47.245
Okay, so what's this lever do?

10:47.247 --> 10:50.849
- That manipulates
the secondary shaft.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.350
- Oh, the secondary shaft.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.085
[shudders]
ah-ooga!

10:54.087 --> 10:55.654
[laughter]

10:55.656 --> 10:57.355
- The lift capacity's
up to 2,000 pounds.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.690
That's a lot of beets.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.291
- Let's talk terms.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.361
If you agree to a 40-60 split
on this tractor,

11:03.363 --> 11:05.397
I'll store it
in one of my barns.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.999
- Mr. Bruegger, are you trying
to take advantage of me

11:08.001 --> 11:09.668
Because I'm interested
in your daughter?

11:09.670 --> 11:12.003
50-50 split,
or no deal.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.807
- Esther, get in the truck.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.275
- No, wait--okay, wait.

11:17.277 --> 11:21.146
You win.

11:21.148 --> 11:24.115
- [chuckles] let's get
the paperwork started.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.988
- We should buy
an auger together.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.090
- Oh. Yeah.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.324
Yeah, we should do that.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.859
- You would be a great one

11:34.861 --> 11:37.362
To buy an auger with.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.201
- Hello, honey, I just spoke
to the tv repairman,

11:43.203 --> 11:45.704
And he says we need
to keep our tvs turned off

11:45.706 --> 11:47.005
For a couple of months.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.007
Something about the wiring.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.909
- Oh!
Seven new comments.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.745
"the guy at 0:19 is hawt."

11:53.747 --> 11:55.146
- "hi, bongripper,

11:55.148 --> 11:57.115
"it's me, andy,
the guy from 0:19.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.451
"I'm glad that you enjoyed
my work in that promo.

11:59.453 --> 12:01.753
"I really enjoyed
your comment.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.455
"going to read
some more comments now.

12:03.457 --> 12:07.025
Have a great day!"

12:07.027 --> 12:11.362
"he's not hawt.
He's gay."

12:16.102 --> 12:18.036
"dear jasonjasonjason,

12:18.038 --> 12:19.170
"it's me, andy.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.772
"nice name. Not!

12:20.774 --> 12:22.073
"guess what?
I'm not gay.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.175
"so you're an idiot.
And I am hawt,

12:24.177 --> 12:27.378
"according to people
on this site who have a brain.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.782
Never comment on this page
ever again."

12:30.784 --> 12:32.117
"he is hawt."

12:32.119 --> 12:36.187
See? Thank you.
That's more like it.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.957
"he is butt."

12:38.959 --> 12:41.893
Agh! Damn it!

12:41.895 --> 12:44.395
I'm about to lose
my freaking mind!

12:44.397 --> 12:49.134
Screw you, texaspoontappa.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.502
Ugh.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.837
- Security deposit.
That's been--

12:52.839 --> 12:54.506
- Standard.
- Right. Standard.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.174
- Hey, can I talk to you
for one second?

12:56.176 --> 12:57.976
- Not now.
No. No.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.177
- Just one second.
- No.

12:59.179 --> 13:03.348
On a tractor with the father
of a woman I plan to inseminate.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.016
- Don't do it.
- What?

13:05.018 --> 13:06.084
Don't you cap that pen.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.085
Do not cap that pen!

13:07.087 --> 13:09.020
- Do n--
you capped it!

13:09.022 --> 13:10.188
Wow.
You are serious.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.289
Okay, you've got two minutes.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.490
Then the cap comes off.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.927
- Dude, we're being conned.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.328
- Go on.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.798
- These chicks are way too hot
to be into us.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.066
Esther's just pretending
to like you

13:22.068 --> 13:24.102
So that you'll buy her daddy
a new tractor.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.038
- No.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.106
- Yeah, the sister's
trying to seduce me

13:28.108 --> 13:29.474
Into buying an auger
with her.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.075
- What?
Has the warrantee expired

13:31.077 --> 13:32.243
On the auger you have now?

13:32.245 --> 13:36.080
- I don't even know
what an auger is.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.982
- No woman
would ever want a man

13:37.984 --> 13:40.151
Who doesn't know
what an auger is.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.254
- Hey.
You ready to sign?

13:43.256 --> 13:46.090
- I just need a moment
to consider your offer.

13:46.092 --> 13:50.195
Excuse me.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.837
[knock at door]

13:58.839 --> 14:00.138
- Oh, hey.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.106
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.575
- Hi.
I'm sorry.

14:03.577 --> 14:04.576
Do you have a minute?
Is this a bad time?

14:04.578 --> 14:05.577
- No, no.
Please, yeah.

14:05.579 --> 14:10.014
Come on in.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.416
Good to see you.
Um, sorry.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.985
My place
is usually not this--

14:13.987 --> 14:17.889
- Yeah, no, I--
actually, it's always like this.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.557
[laughter]
you want to go outside?

14:19.559 --> 14:20.925
It's a little less cluttered
out there.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.093
- Sure. Yeah.
- Yeah?

14:22.095 --> 14:23.361
- Yeah.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.197
- [sighs]

14:26.199 --> 14:30.101
- Let me grab a couple drinks.
- Okay.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.903
Oh, wow, you have
a nice view.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.371
- All right.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.007
That's for you.
- Oh, thank you.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.309
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.278
[radio plays loudly]
- all right.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.080
How much have you revealed
on camera

14:42.082 --> 14:44.015
About your relationship
with the senator?

14:44.017 --> 14:46.150
- They caught us kissing
on Halloween.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.253
- [gasps] he was dressed
like ronald reagan!

14:48.255 --> 14:50.221
- Oww!
- God.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.290
- Angela! Well, he kissed
like jack kennedy.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.192
Oh!
- Stop it.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.561
Someone needs to call
and warn him.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.229
This could ruin his career.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.298
- I don't like
giving him bad news.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.334
- Call him! Call him!
- Stop hitting me! No!

15:03.336 --> 15:06.304
- So...
- So...

15:06.306 --> 15:08.172
- What brings you by?

15:08.174 --> 15:10.909
- Well, the promo
for the documentary aired today.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.110
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.045
It's kind of crazy.
- It is.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.980
- See all this, like,
old stuff.

15:15.982 --> 15:19.183
- I know.
- Like, there's that shot

15:19.185 --> 15:21.619
Of jim and I up on the roof.
- Oh, yeah, that was--

15:21.621 --> 15:24.055
That was a good moment.
- Yeah, wasn't that neat?

15:24.057 --> 15:26.357
- Yeah, that was cool.
- Yeah.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.693
And there's this one
when we were listening

15:28.695 --> 15:31.095
To music,
and it's like--

15:31.097 --> 15:33.331
We didn't even know
we were in love.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.200
And it's--

15:36.202 --> 15:39.103
But...

15:39.105 --> 15:41.439
Do you think jim's changed?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.174
- Um...
- I'm sorry.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.342
Did that--
but that was out of the blue.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.710
I just mean,
because you know us,

15:45.712 --> 15:47.512
And you've, like,
observed us

15:47.514 --> 15:51.416
For ten years,
and I feel like he's--

15:51.418 --> 15:55.186
I just feel like he's
so into his work right now,

15:55.188 --> 15:57.989
And...

15:57.991 --> 16:00.591
I don't know.
Am I crazy?

16:00.593 --> 16:03.494
- No, you're not crazy.

16:05.497 --> 16:10.068
- Well, I wish that made me
feel better.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.571
Listen, so everybody
saw the promos,

16:13.573 --> 16:15.106
And they're
kind of freaking out.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.474
- [chuckles]
- 'cause it seems

16:16.476 --> 16:19.143
Like you got a lot
of private stuff on camera.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.112
- Yeah.
- You know, stuff people

16:21.114 --> 16:23.081
Didn't intend
for everyone to see,

16:23.083 --> 16:25.249
And they kind of want
to know how much.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.985
- They want to know
how much what?

16:26.987 --> 16:28.519
- How much stuff you got.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.288
- Pretty much everything.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.157
- Well, yeah, but what if we
turn off our mic packs?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.325
- They've got parabolic mics.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.693
They can pick you up
100 yards away.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.130
So, no, if you were
around there, they got you.

16:39.132 --> 16:42.367
- So we basically had
no privacy for ten years.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.469
- That's not really true.
I mean...

16:44.471 --> 16:48.106
That's--
- um...

16:48.108 --> 16:49.707
Yeah, I gotta go.

16:49.709 --> 16:50.742
- Oh, no,
hang on a second.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.343
Pam, I'm sorry.
I--I--

16:52.345 --> 16:53.745
I can explain this
so much better.

16:53.747 --> 16:56.147
- No, I think
you explained it.

16:56.149 --> 16:59.150
- Look, if you give me a chance,
I can--pam.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.789
- ""against the evilwin
thspace yankees.Me

17:04.791 --> 17:06.391
Eat fresh."

17:06.393 --> 17:07.525
- That'll pay
for the exploding helicopter.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.494
- Smart.
- Mm-hmm.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.263
- "suddenly, the evil thugs
break into the stadium.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.299
The big piece hits baseball
at the evil thugs."

17:15.301 --> 17:17.335
- "buy me some peanuts
and cracker jacks."

17:17.337 --> 17:19.337
- Come on, man.
Sell it.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.373
- Yeah, jim.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.575
- [forceful] "buy me some
peanuts and cracker jacks!"

17:24.577 --> 17:26.110
- Yeah, that's better.

17:26.112 --> 17:27.812
"a bunch of hot women go,

17:27.814 --> 17:29.380
'oh, yeah.'"

17:29.382 --> 17:31.482
- "megan, I was too shy
to tell you this

17:31.484 --> 17:33.684
"when I was just a normal
professional baseball player,

17:33.686 --> 17:36.320
But I love you."

17:36.322 --> 17:38.423
- "they kiss.
It is super emotional.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.359
Like in <i>toy story."</i>
<i>- wow.</i>

17:41.361 --> 17:44.362
Can't wait to read
the rest of it later,

17:44.364 --> 17:46.230
See how it ends.
- It's so strong.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.366
- Keep reading then.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.069
- "gotta go. Darth vader's
launching a huge attack."

17:51.071 --> 17:53.237
- Um, another thing.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.106
I'm gonna need you
to get me the rights

17:55.108 --> 17:58.176
To darth vader.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.278
- I don't know how we'd
go about doing that, but...

18:00.280 --> 18:02.413
- We can look into it.
- We'll look into it.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.681
- We need darth.

18:03.683 --> 18:07.151
- We're gonna go get him.
- That's what we're gonna do.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.719
- We're gonna go get him.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.755
- Maybe you're right.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.223
Esther's a ten,

18:12.225 --> 18:13.758
And the best I've ever done
is angela,

18:13.760 --> 18:15.693
Who's a nine,
and she rejected me.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.429
- A scranton nine,
but, yeah, point taken.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.565
Hey, let's go out tonight

18:20.567 --> 18:22.834
And just score
a couple fours, huh?

18:22.836 --> 18:25.269
I mean, there are no games
with fours.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.671
- Who needs
a new tractor anyway?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.372
Maybe we're the kind of guys

18:28.374 --> 18:30.441
