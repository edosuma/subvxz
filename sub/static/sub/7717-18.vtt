00:05.772 --> 00:09.008
- Phyllis has gotten
sheinto audiobooks,n.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.443
And lately she's been listening
to <i>50 shades of grey,</i>

00:11.445 --> 00:14.179
Which, if you don't know
what it is,

00:14.181 --> 00:17.149
It's a book about, uh, um--
- it's porn.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.051
- Yeah.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.352
[chair squeaking]

00:20.354 --> 00:23.222
- Seriously?

00:23.224 --> 00:24.656
This is unacceptable.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.692
It's officially
a hostile work environment.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.127
- Why?

00:28.129 --> 00:31.196
Tell her it's not okay
to do this in public.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.698
- Be careful.
I pulled my mom's dog

00:32.700 --> 00:34.366
Off the pillow once,
and I got bit.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.668
- Just ignore her.
Sooner or later, she'll finish.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.704
[all groaning]
- meredith! Good lord.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.206
- What?
- Phyllis is masturbating

00:41.208 --> 00:43.475
In the office
right now as we speak.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.245
- Can we skip the color
commentary and just have andy

00:46.247 --> 00:47.679
Go out there
and fire her?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.348
- He can't do that.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.250
Turns out she's allowed
to have feelings

00:51.252 --> 00:52.718
Of sexual arousal.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.553
Doesn't become a violation

00:54.555 --> 00:56.355
Till she physically
acts on it.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.323
[all exclaim]

00:58.325 --> 01:00.692
- W-w-wait, wait.
Why is phyllis so aroused?

01:00.694 --> 01:03.429
- She's listening
to <i>50 shades of grey.</i>

01:03.431 --> 01:06.298
- Well, there you go.
That's <i>muy caliente.</i>

01:06.300 --> 01:10.302
- Okay, you are useless.
I'll take care of this.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.206
- [sputters]
what the hell?

01:14.208 --> 01:16.442
- It's okay, guys.
She's no longer horny.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.510
- Excuse me,
dirty birdie.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.145
- What?

01:20.147 --> 01:22.681
- You can have this back
at the end of the day.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.783
- Okay.

01:26.386 --> 01:27.419
- [yelps]

01:27.421 --> 01:30.222
[cheerful music]

01:30.224 --> 01:37.129
â™ª

01:37.131 --> 01:39.098
- Clark, I need your advice.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.532
I'm having some lady troubles.

01:40.534 --> 01:43.368
- What's her name?
- Esther bruegger.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.571
- Sweet.
- Lives on the neighboring farm.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.239
85 acres.
- Oh, yeah.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.507
Keep talking.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.109
- Well, we've been out
three times.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.743
There has been physicality.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.679
The thing is, we were hanging
out with her father

01:53.681 --> 01:55.314
The other night,
looking at a farm catalogue,

01:55.316 --> 01:57.850
Next thing I know he wants
to lease a tractor with me.

01:57.852 --> 01:59.418
- [groans]

01:59.420 --> 02:01.286
[laughs]

02:01.288 --> 02:03.322
- What do you think?

02:03.324 --> 02:05.324
- The same thing
that you think.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.327
- Long-term tractor leases can
put pressure on a relationship.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.461
- God, a lot of my buddies
are going

02:09.463 --> 02:10.796
Through the same thing
right now.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.331
Something in the air.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.365
- Here you go.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.234
And good for you, dwight.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.768
I'm so glad
you found someone.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.471
I bet she's got kind eyes.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.740
Dwight is dating
a brussels sprout farmer

02:21.742 --> 02:23.242
Named esther.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.344
She's coming here this afternoon
with her father.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.578
Who knows?

02:26.580 --> 02:28.313
Maybe she'll be pulling
the horse cart.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.315
[chuckling]

02:30.317 --> 02:33.252
[amused sigh]

02:33.254 --> 02:35.654
- Cece has been calling me
pamela.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.189
Like, four times this week.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.423
- Oh, man.

02:38.425 --> 02:39.791
[chuckles]

02:39.793 --> 02:41.360
- I wonder if she'll
start calling you jim.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.295
- Oh, boy.
Please don't.

02:43.297 --> 02:46.331
- I know.
- Let's not let that happen.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.301
- [chuckles] um...

02:49.303 --> 02:52.538
- Oh, what was I gonna--
what was I gonna say?

02:52.540 --> 02:53.906
- Well, you know,
your assistant told me

02:53.908 --> 02:56.275
That you have
a big pitch meeting today.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.311
With ryan howard.
How did that happen?

02:59.313 --> 03:01.246
- Not that ryan howard.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.415
The phillies first baseman.
- Oh! Oh, okay.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.317
- Yeah, yeah.
Exactly.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.619
- [sighs]

03:07.621 --> 03:09.521
Um, okay.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.856
Well...
- Yeah.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.258
So I'll talk to you later?

03:13.260 --> 03:14.226
- Yeah, sounds good.
Okay.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.227
- Okay, great.
- Yup.

03:15.229 --> 03:18.897
Both: Bye.

03:18.899 --> 03:22.234
[laughter]

03:22.236 --> 03:23.535
- What's going on?

03:23.537 --> 03:26.471
Ooh, did <i>gangnam style</i>
<i>put out a new song?</i>

03:26.473 --> 03:27.906
- There's a promo
for the documentary

03:27.908 --> 03:29.841
On the web.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.844
- Play it again.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.681
[upbeat guitar music]

03:35.683 --> 03:38.383
- The boss.
[all murmur]

03:38.385 --> 03:40.986
- There's michael.
- The workers.

03:45.325 --> 03:49.728
The lives.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.698
The loves.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.435
The people.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.542
The paper.

04:09.682 --> 04:13.018
<i>The office:</i>
<i>An american workplace.</i>

04:13.020 --> 04:15.821
Coming soon on wvia.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.422
- Whoa.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.992
You go to the bathroom
for 45 minutes,

04:19.994 --> 04:22.694
And everything changes.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.730
This is a documentary?

04:24.732 --> 04:26.431
Ohh.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.834
I always thought
we were, like, specimens

04:28.836 --> 04:31.336
In a human zoo.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.577
[typing on keyboard]

04:38.579 --> 04:40.846
- Did you see this?

04:40.848 --> 04:42.381
[clatter]

04:42.383 --> 04:43.882
- Your screen is all black.

04:43.884 --> 04:47.853
You just unplugged
your computer.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.359
- Oh, my god.
Is that you and jim?

04:54.361 --> 04:56.895
- Uh-huh.
- Jeez.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.430
You fell in love
with that hair?

04:58.432 --> 05:00.065
Really?
[chuckles]

05:00.067 --> 05:02.834
Yikes.

05:02.836 --> 05:06.505
That is awful.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.707
- It wasn't so bad.

05:08.709 --> 05:09.941
- Guys, are you reading
the online comments?

05:09.943 --> 05:12.911
Somebody commented
on my banjo playing.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.780
"banjo at 0:19 is a'ight."

05:14.782 --> 05:17.849
Internet, calm down!
[chuckles]

05:17.851 --> 05:19.885
I must have really connected
with this guy.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.420
I mean, that's a guy's name,
right?

05:21.422 --> 05:23.488
Chobblegobbler?

05:26.459 --> 05:27.993
[elevator dings]

05:30.463 --> 05:31.797
- Hey, man, how you doing?
Jim halpert.

05:31.799 --> 05:32.931
- Nice to meet you.
Eat fresh.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.800
- Hey, man. Darryl.
- Hey, man. Ryan.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.768
Nice to meet you.
Eat fresh.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.470
Eat fresh.
[clicks tongue]

05:38.472 --> 05:41.873
- Let's go
to the conference room.

05:44.110 --> 05:47.779
- Esther's on her way up.
I wonder if she wants a snack.

05:47.781 --> 05:48.947
Let me see.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.783
I know she likes apples
and carrots.

05:51.785 --> 05:55.053
I bet she'll eat 'em
right out of your hand

05:55.055 --> 05:56.888
With those big, strong teeth.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.057
- Did I tell you
about her teeth?

05:59.059 --> 06:00.959
- Hey, dwight,
you have some guests.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.862
I think they're from the forest
where we harvest our paper.

06:05.898 --> 06:07.833
- [silently]
yes.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.602
- Ah, the bruegger family.
Welcome.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.903
- Fine office you have here.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.004
Sturdy walls.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.374
- Yes. Esther.

06:15.376 --> 06:19.911
You look radiant as always.

06:19.913 --> 06:23.081
- I guess men find esther
attractive.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.850
I mean,
if there are chubby chasers,

06:24.852 --> 06:29.888
Then there are men
that like that thing.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.657
- Weird to see how we used
to look in those promos.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.093
Some of us
have changed so much.

06:35.095 --> 06:38.063
- We've all changed.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.068
- With our firm,
you'll be building equity

06:43.070 --> 06:44.903
For long after they retire
your number.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.773
- And we all know
baseball does not last forever.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.040
- I look
at these actors on tv,

06:49.042 --> 06:51.710
And I think, "come on.
I can do that."

06:51.712 --> 06:53.912
- Right?
[chuckles].

06:53.914 --> 06:55.514
- Watch this.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.815
Eat fresh.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.517
Now what does that
make you think of?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.585
- Subway sandwiches.
- Yeah.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.821
- How? I didn't say
"subway sandwiches"

07:02.823 --> 07:04.589
It's called
playing the subtext.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.092
- Wow.
- I actually wrote a screenplay.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.960
It's called <i>the big piece.</i>

07:08.962 --> 07:11.029
- Based on his nickname.
I like it already.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.931
Let me guess.
It's autobiographical.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.700
- Half-biopic,
half-superhero movie.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.470
The mild-mannered professional
baseball player ryan howard

07:18.472 --> 07:19.805
Hits a home run...
- Okay.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.106
- Into outer space.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.874
Ball comes back
with space dust on it,

07:22.876 --> 07:25.777
Which transforms him
into the big piece.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.814
- The space dust does it.
- Space dust.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.148
- Okay.
- I actually brought

07:30.150 --> 07:31.850
Some copies of my script

07:31.852 --> 07:33.485
If you guys want
to read it together.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.187
- Sure, yeah.
[chuckles]

07:35.189 --> 07:37.889
â™ª hollywood

07:37.891 --> 07:39.157
All right.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.159
- Yeah, we're gonna read it.
- Okay, great.

07:41.161 --> 07:44.863
- Andy, are there
documentary groupies?

07:44.865 --> 07:46.064
- Of course there are.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.699
- Of course.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.834
- A little ironic

07:48.836 --> 07:50.535
That I'm gonna be
kind of a tv star,

07:50.537 --> 07:52.838
Because my last
chad flenderman novel

07:52.840 --> 07:57.008
Was based
on a murdered tv star.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.144
<i>The small scream.</i>
<i>- Oh, I don't care.</i>

07:59.146 --> 08:01.746
- Hey, guys,
I just found another promo.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.982
It's in danish.
- Danish?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.217
- I guess it's
gonna start airing in denmark.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.852
- Oh, my god.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.988
[man speaking danish]

08:18.197 --> 08:20.899
- What was that word they said
when they showed me?

08:20.901 --> 08:23.768
<i>Skrald mand?</i>
<i>What's that mean in danish?</i>

08:23.770 --> 08:25.904
"cool guy?"

08:25.906 --> 08:27.606
- "dumpster man."

08:27.608 --> 08:29.841
- Cool.
Superhero.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.076
- What about me?

08:31.078 --> 08:33.778
- <i>Cloken tre pige.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Tre pige.</i>

08:33.780 --> 08:35.914
"3:00 p.M. Girl."

08:35.916 --> 08:37.549
- What?

08:37.551 --> 08:38.984
Why would they--
w--wait a second.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.151
Wait a second.
What was that?

08:40.153 --> 08:42.888
[typing on keyboard]
[gasps]

08:42.890 --> 08:44.890
I didn't know
they were filming then.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.826
- It looks like the cameraman
was hiding behind the shelves.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.995
- Wait, so they were filming
all the time,

08:49.997 --> 08:51.730
Even when we didn't know it?

08:51.732 --> 08:53.265
- Oh, my god.

08:58.070 --> 09:01.573
- Tbut I am fine with it.Et
filmingi mean it.Pected.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.041
I am.
- Are you kidding me?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.309
It's like half the show
is secret footage.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.011
- I am a very private person.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.046
I show 'em when I want
to show 'em.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.282
Who wants a taste?
Boob sauce!

09:10.284 --> 09:12.083
- Meredith!
- Come on!

09:12.085 --> 09:13.752
- Oh, my god.
Do they film us at night

09:13.754 --> 09:15.720
When we're sleeping?
- Yes, erin.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.855
They film us at night
when we're sleeping

09:16.857 --> 09:17.889
'cause that makes great tv.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.157
- Hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.825
- Oscar.
- I'm sorry, sweetie.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.061
This whole thing
is just freaking me out.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.030
I have been very honest
with you guys

09:25.032 --> 09:27.132
In a way that could seriously
impact the political career

09:27.134 --> 09:29.134
Of a very good friend
of mine.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.003
You're not gonna use
any of that, are you?

09:32.005 --> 09:34.272
- People, relax.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.174
We are killing it online.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.642
Have you guys
checked the comments?

09:37.644 --> 09:39.010
Smokethatskinwagon says,

09:39.012 --> 09:41.646
"you guys are killing it."
I mean...

09:41.648 --> 09:44.716
We're internet sensations,
guys.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.284
- I think we need to figure out
what's going on.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.087
I might just take
a little walk.

09:49.089 --> 09:53.191
- Yes, a little walk
sounds like a good idea.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.260
- Okay.

09:57.363 --> 10:01.600
[indistinct whispering]

10:01.602 --> 10:03.168
- Okay, everyone,
turn off your mics.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.210
- We need to know more.
Did those shots have sound?

10:12.212 --> 10:14.179
What exactly did they get
on tape?

10:14.181 --> 10:16.615
- I sneezed into my hands
without using purell

10:16.617 --> 10:17.849
And then dipped
into the candy jar.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.351
Did they film that?
- My first week here,

10:19.353 --> 10:21.019
I sneezed directly
into the candy jar

10:21.021 --> 10:22.387
Because I thought
I'd get more--

10:22.389 --> 10:24.222
I thought I'd get
more screen time as a villain.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.257
- Okay, pam, why don't you
visit your buddy,

10:26.259 --> 10:28.326
The crew guy that got fired,
find out what they got?

10:28.328 --> 10:29.995
- Brian?

10:29.997 --> 10:32.097
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I guess I could.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.165
- Hurry, pam.
I need to know how much hellfire

10:34.167 --> 10:35.767
Is gonna rain down on me.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.235
- I thought teri knew
about cynthia.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.704
- She does, but neither of them
know about lydia.

10:39.706 --> 10:42.107
- Ooh.
- Wow.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.877
- Whoa!
[laughter]

10:45.879 --> 10:47.245
Okay, so what's this lever do?

10:47.247 --> 10:50.849
- That manipulates
the secondary shaft.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.350
- Oh, the secondary shaft.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.085
[shudders]
ah-ooga!

10:54.087 --> 10:55.654
[laughter]

10:55.656 --> 10:57.355
- The lift capacity's
up to 2,000 pounds.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.690
That's a lot of beets.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.291
- Let's talk terms.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.361
If you agree to a 40-60 split
on this tractor,

11:03.363 --> 11:05.397
I'll store it
in one of my barns.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.999
- Mr. Bruegger, are you trying
to take advantage of me

11:08.001 --> 11:09.668
Because I'm interested
in your daughter?

11:09.670 --> 11:12.003
50-50 split,
or no deal.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.807
- Esther, get in the truck.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.275
- No, wait--okay, wait.

11:17.277 --> 11:21.146
You win.

11:21.148 --> 11:24.115
- [chuckles] let's get
the paperwork started.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.988
- We should buy
an auger together.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.090
- Oh. Yeah.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.324
Yeah, we should do that.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.859
- You would be a great one

11:34.861 --> 11:37.362
To buy an auger with.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.201
- Hello, honey, I just spoke
to the tv repairman,

11:43.203 --> 11:45.704
And he says we need
to keep our tvs turned off

11:45.706 --> 11:47.005
For a couple of months.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.007
Something about the wiring.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.909
- Oh!
Seven new comments.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.745
"the guy at 0:19 is hawt."

11:53.747 --> 11:55.146
- "hi, bongripper,

11:55.148 --> 11:57.115
"it's me, andy,
the guy from 0:19.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.451
"I'm glad that you enjoyed
my work in that promo.

11:59.453 --> 12:01.753
"I really enjoyed
your comment.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.455
"going to read
some more comments now.

12:03.457 --> 12:07.025
Have a great day!"

12:07.027 --> 12:11.362
"he's not hawt.
He's gay."

12:16.102 --> 12:18.036
"dear jasonjasonjason,

12:18.038 --> 12:19.170
"it's me, andy.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.772
"nice name. Not!

12:20.774 --> 12:22.073
"guess what?
I'm not gay.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.175
"so you're an idiot.
And I am hawt,

12:24.177 --> 12:27.378
"according to people
on this site who have a brain.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.782
Never comment on this page
ever again."

12:30.784 --> 12:32.117
"he is hawt."

12:32.119 --> 12:36.187
See? Thank you.
That's more like it.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.957
"he is butt."

12:38.959 --> 12:41.893
Agh! Damn it!

12:41.895 --> 12:44.395
I'm about to lose
my freaking mind!

12:44.397 --> 12:49.134
Screw you, texaspoontappa.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.502
Ugh.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.837
- Security deposit.
That's been--

12:52.839 --> 12:54.506
- Standard.
- Right. Standard.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.174
- Hey, can I talk to you
for one second?

12:56.176 --> 12:57.976
- Not now.
No. No.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.177
- Just one second.
- No.

12:59.179 --> 13:03.348
On a tractor with the father
of a woman I plan to inseminate.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.016
- Don't do it.
- What?

13:05.018 --> 13:06.084
Don't you cap that pen.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.085
Do not cap that pen!

13:07.087 --> 13:09.020
- Do n--
you capped it!

13:09.022 --> 13:10.188
Wow.
You are serious.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.289
Okay, you've got two minutes.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.490
Then the cap comes off.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.927
- Dude, we're being conned.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.328
- Go on.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.798
- These chicks are way too hot
to be into us.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.066
Esther's just pretending
to like you

13:22.068 --> 13:24.102
So that you'll buy her daddy
a new tractor.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.038
- No.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.106
- Yeah, the sister's
trying to seduce me

13:28.108 --> 13:29.474
Into buying an auger
with her.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.075
- What?
Has the warrantee expired

13:31.077 --> 13:32.243
On the auger you have now?

13:32.245 --> 13:36.080
- I don't even know
what an auger is.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.982
- No woman
would ever want a man

13:37.984 --> 13:40.151
Who doesn't know
what an auger is.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.254
- Hey.
You ready to sign?

13:43.256 --> 13:46.090
- I just need a moment
to consider your offer.

13:46.092 --> 13:50.195
Excuse me.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.837
[knock at door]

13:58.839 --> 14:00.138
- Oh, hey.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.106
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.575
- Hi.
I'm sorry.

14:03.577 --> 14:04.576
Do you have a minute?
Is this a bad time?

14:04.578 --> 14:05.577
- No, no.
Please, yeah.

14:05.579 --> 14:10.014
Come on in.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.416
Good to see you.
Um, sorry.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.985
My place
is usually not this--

14:13.987 --> 14:17.889
- Yeah, no, I--
actually, it's always like this.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.557
[laughter]
you want to go outside?

14:19.559 --> 14:20.925
It's a little less cluttered
out there.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.093
- Sure. Yeah.
- Yeah?

14:22.095 --> 14:23.361
- Yeah.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.197
- [sighs]

14:26.199 --> 14:30.101
- Let me grab a couple drinks.
- Okay.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.903
Oh, wow, you have
a nice view.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.371
- All right.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.007
That's for you.
- Oh, thank you.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.309
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.278
[radio plays loudly]
- all right.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.080
How much have you revealed
on camera

14:42.082 --> 14:44.015
About your relationship
with the senator?

14:44.017 --> 14:46.150
- They caught us kissing
on Halloween.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.253
- [gasps] he was dressed
like ronald reagan!

14:48.255 --> 14:50.221
- Oww!
- God.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.290
- Angela! Well, he kissed
like jack kennedy.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.192
Oh!
- Stop it.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.561
Someone needs to call
and warn him.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.229
This could ruin his career.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.298
- I don't like
giving him bad news.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.334
- Call him! Call him!
- Stop hitting me! No!

15:03.336 --> 15:06.304
- So...
- So...

15:06.306 --> 15:08.172
- What brings you by?

15:08.174 --> 15:10.909
- Well, the promo
for the documentary aired today.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.110
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.045
It's kind of crazy.
- It is.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.980
- See all this, like,
old stuff.

15:15.982 --> 15:19.183
- I know.
- Like, there's that shot

15:19.185 --> 15:21.619
Of jim and I up on the roof.
- Oh, yeah, that was--

15:21.621 --> 15:24.055
That was a good moment.
- Yeah, wasn't that neat?

15:24.057 --> 15:26.357
- Yeah, that was cool.
- Yeah.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.693
And there's this one
when we were listening

15:28.695 --> 15:31.095
To music,
and it's like--

15:31.097 --> 15:33.331
We didn't even know
we were in love.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.200
And it's--

15:36.202 --> 15:39.103
But...

15:39.105 --> 15:41.439
Do you think jim's changed?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.174
- Um...
- I'm sorry.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.342
Did that--
but that was out of the blue.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.710
I just mean,
because you know us,

15:45.712 --> 15:47.512
And you've, like,
observed us

15:47.514 --> 15:51.416
For ten years,
and I feel like he's--

15:51.418 --> 15:55.186
I just feel like he's
so into his work right now,

15:55.188 --> 15:57.989
And...

15:57.991 --> 16:00.591
I don't know.
Am I crazy?

16:00.593 --> 16:03.494
- No, you're not crazy.

16:05.497 --> 16:10.068
- Well, I wish that made me
feel better.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.571
Listen, so everybody
saw the promos,

16:13.573 --> 16:15.106
And they're
kind of freaking out.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.474
- [chuckles]
- 'cause it seems

16:16.476 --> 16:19.143
Like you got a lot
of private stuff on camera.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.112
- Yeah.
- You know, stuff people

16:21.114 --> 16:23.081
Didn't intend
for everyone to see,

16:23.083 --> 16:25.249
And they kind of want
to know how much.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.985
- They want to know
how much what?

16:26.987 --> 16:28.519
- How much stuff you got.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.288
- Pretty much everything.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.157
- Well, yeah, but what if we
turn off our mic packs?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.325
- They've got parabolic mics.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.693
They can pick you up
100 yards away.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.130
So, no, if you were
around there, they got you.

16:39.132 --> 16:42.367
- So we basically had
no privacy for ten years.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.469
- That's not really true.
I mean...

16:44.471 --> 16:48.106
That's--
- um...

16:48.108 --> 16:49.707
Yeah, I gotta go.

16:49.709 --> 16:50.742
- Oh, no,
hang on a second.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.343
Pam, I'm sorry.
I--I--

16:52.345 --> 16:53.745
I can explain this
so much better.

16:53.747 --> 16:56.147
- No, I think
you explained it.

16:56.149 --> 16:59.150
- Look, if you give me a chance,
I can--pam.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.789
- ""against the evilwin
thspace yankees.Me

17:04.791 --> 17:06.391
Eat fresh."

17:06.393 --> 17:07.525
- That'll pay
for the exploding helicopter.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.494
- Smart.
- Mm-hmm.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.263
- "suddenly, the evil thugs
break into the stadium.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.299
The big piece hits baseball
at the evil thugs."

17:15.301 --> 17:17.335
- "buy me some peanuts
and cracker jacks."

17:17.337 --> 17:19.337
- Come on, man.
Sell it.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.373
- Yeah, jim.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.575
- [forceful] "buy me some
peanuts and cracker jacks!"

17:24.577 --> 17:26.110
- Yeah, that's better.

17:26.112 --> 17:27.812
"a bunch of hot women go,

17:27.814 --> 17:29.380
'oh, yeah.'"

17:29.382 --> 17:31.482
- "megan, I was too shy
to tell you this

17:31.484 --> 17:33.684
"when I was just a normal
professional baseball player,

17:33.686 --> 17:36.320
But I love you."

17:36.322 --> 17:38.423
- "they kiss.
It is super emotional.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.359
Like in <i>toy story."</i>
<i>- wow.</i>

17:41.361 --> 17:44.362
Can't wait to read
the rest of it later,

17:44.364 --> 17:46.230
See how it ends.
- It's so strong.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.366
- Keep reading then.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.069
- "gotta go. Darth vader's
launching a huge attack."

17:51.071 --> 17:53.237
- Um, another thing.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.106
I'm gonna need you
to get me the rights

17:55.108 --> 17:58.176
To darth vader.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.278
- I don't know how we'd
go about doing that, but...

18:00.280 --> 18:02.413
- We can look into it.
- We'll look into it.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.681
- We need darth.

18:03.683 --> 18:07.151
- We're gonna go get him.
- That's what we're gonna do.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.719
- We're gonna go get him.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.755
- Maybe you're right.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.223
Esther's a ten,

18:12.225 --> 18:13.758
And the best I've ever done
is angela,

18:13.760 --> 18:15.693
Who's a nine,
and she rejected me.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.429
- A scranton nine,
but, yeah, point taken.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.565
Hey, let's go out tonight

18:20.567 --> 18:22.834
And just score
a couple fours, huh?

18:22.836 --> 18:25.269
I mean, there are no games
with fours.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.671
- Who needs
a new tractor anyway?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.372
Maybe we're the kind of guys

18:28.374 --> 18:30.441
Who end up with a tractor
that's already been rode hard

18:30.443 --> 18:31.776
And put away muddy.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.480
Guys like us,
we got to plant our seed

18:35.482 --> 18:37.315
A different way.
- By hand.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.517
[door opens]
- dwight.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.385
We need to talk.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.287
- I don't know
that there's anything left

18:43.289 --> 18:45.389
For us to talk about,
esther.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.325
- Look, we're gonna have
the tractor for the same amount

18:47.327 --> 18:49.293
Of work days, but my dad
is planning on leasing it

18:49.295 --> 18:50.828
To the vanderkirk brothers
on the weekends.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.396
- No.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.332
- So you're gonna be
paying more, but he's putting on

18:54.334 --> 18:56.167
Ten times the miles,
and he's pocketing a profit

18:56.169 --> 18:58.369
Behind your back.
- That snake!

18:58.371 --> 19:00.204
- You need to tell him you want
a deal based on miles,

19:00.206 --> 19:01.405
Or he can just stick
that tractor

19:01.407 --> 19:02.874
Where the sun don't shine.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.709
- That shady grove
out by willard's pond.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.410
- Mm-hmm.

19:06.412 --> 19:09.780
- So...You're fine with me
not leasing the tractor?

19:09.782 --> 19:12.483
I mean, our courtship
can proceed?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.318
- Of course.

19:14.320 --> 19:18.189
You didn't think I was just
tractor bait, did you?

19:18.191 --> 19:20.424
- N-no.
- [laughs]

19:20.426 --> 19:21.759
- That--
- yeah.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.362
- Hey, dwight.
What's an auger used for?

19:24.364 --> 19:26.264
- Post hole digging.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.367
[laughter]

19:29.369 --> 19:30.735
[telephone ringing]

19:30.737 --> 19:32.737
- You've reached
senator robert lipton.

19:32.739 --> 19:35.206
Please leave a message.
[telephone beeps]

19:35.208 --> 19:36.307
- Hi, honey!
- Hey, honey.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.341
- No, you go.
- Go. No, go ahead.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.377
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, hey, robert.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.312
- It's angela and oscar.
- Hey.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.580
- Just a few quick things.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.516
- Um, the documentary's
going to be airing soon,

19:45.518 --> 19:47.718
And--and you look great
in the promos.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.687
- Oh, you look so handsome.
- Oh.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.489
- Very presidential.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.591
- Very much so. Absolutely.
- Yeah.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.760
- Hey, I get the sense
you're gonna be outed as gay.

19:55.762 --> 19:58.863
- Yes, and I cheated on you
with dwight.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.464
It looks
like they got it on film.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.833
I didn't tell you about it.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.735
- I think that's it.
- I think we're good.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.305
- Done. Okay.
- Bye. Love you.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.507

20:11.410 --> 20:14.345
