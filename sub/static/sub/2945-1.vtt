00:24.000 --> 00:25.968
(TIRES SQUEALING)

00:45.120 --> 00:47.648
Just three more days
until Gotham will be able...

00:47.798 --> 00:50.131
to spot the passage
of the Midas Heart...

00:50.281 --> 00:55.365
the asteroid with a solid gold core
that passes the Earth every 77 years.

00:55.520 --> 00:59.366
And finally, tomorrow night
is the grand opening of the Aviary...

00:59.520 --> 01:02.330
Gotham City's newest
and tallest building.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.483
Count on high society to flock
to Oswald Cobblepot's...

01:05.640 --> 01:09.645
very exclusive
opening night celebration.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.566
OFFICER: This is Car 409-er
with our second sweep of Sector 12.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.649
DISPATCHER:
Go ahead, 409. What's your status?

01:15.840 --> 01:19.322
All clear from up here, dispatch.
Re-engaging for another pass.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.609
DISPATCHER: Roger that, 409.
Hey, you see him tonight?

01:22.760 --> 01:26.003
OFFICER: Sorry, not tonight.
We've got no sign of the Batman.

01:26.160 --> 01:29.050
DISPATCHER: All right.
You let me know if you see him, will you?

01:57.160 --> 01:58.321
(BEEPS)

(CAT MEOWS)

(PHONE RINGS)

02:06.360 --> 02:07.600
Yes, Alfred?

02:07.760 --> 02:11.077
I have a question
that simply will not wait, sir.

02:11.227 --> 02:12.235
BATMAN: Which is?

02:12.385 --> 02:15.109
I was inquiring as to what suit
Bruce Wayne...

02:15.259 --> 02:17.930
might need pressed
for his meetings tomorrow.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.241
And that couldn't wait?

02:19.400 --> 02:23.530
ALFRED: These are the things
that keep me up at night, Master Bruce.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.882
GUARD 1:
Hey, Max, you got plans tonight?

02:36.040 --> 02:38.770
GUARD 2: Me and Charlie were gonna
grab a burger. You down?

02:38.920 --> 02:43.960
GUARD 1: No, headed home for a shower.
I'm getting ripe inside this tin can.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.447
(GROWLS)

02:56.840 --> 02:58.729
Yeah, you and me both... Whoa!

(GUARD GRUNTS)

03:14.800 --> 03:16.165
(GUARD GRUNTS)

03:18.440 --> 03:19.930
Was there anything else, Alfred?

03:20.080 --> 03:23.129
ALFRED: I was inquiring how much longer
your patrol would go this evening.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.011
You see, I've made coq au vin.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.125
Looks like I'll be late.
I've got work to do.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.928
That doesn't belong to you.

04:58.880 --> 04:59.961
(YELLS)

(HORNS HONKING)

05:15.080 --> 05:16.411

(YELLS)

05:23.080 --> 05:24.206
(GRUNTS)

05:36.120 --> 05:38.566
What the heck was...? Whoa.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.768
- It's Batman.
- MAN 1: Hey, look it's Batman.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.605
- MAN 2: Oh, do you see that? It's him.
- WOMAN: Oh, Batman! Oh, wow!

05:46.080 --> 05:47.809
MAN 1: Hey, there he goes.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.042
- MAN 2: What was he doing?
- MAN 3: Did you see that?

06:01.560 --> 06:06.407
Ah. Looks like someone skipped
their catnap to swipe some jewels.

06:15.800 --> 06:21.967
WOMAN: Pretty, shiny, and sparkling.
All my favorite things.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.130
Hold it right there, Catwoman.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.405
Cheetah?

06:30.560 --> 06:31.641
(HISSES)

06:31.800 --> 06:33.723
What's the problem, Nightwing?

06:33.880 --> 06:36.929
Gotham only big enough for one cat-lady?

06:37.120 --> 06:39.088
You'll make me insecure.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.483
Why? You should know by now
that nobody likes a cheetah.

06:42.640 --> 06:43.846
Oh.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.731
Come over here
and we can hiss and make up.

06:46.920 --> 06:50.242
All right. Since you're new in town,
I'll make this fast.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.085
Boy, you don't know fast.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.362
(BOTH GRUNTING)

07:09.680 --> 07:14.208
What pretty eyes you have.
Perhaps I'll keep them.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.847
(CHEETAH LAUGHS)

07:18.880 --> 07:20.245
(YELLS)

07:20.880 --> 07:22.166
(GRUNTS)

07:22.320 --> 07:25.961
Shocking, right? You know, it's okay
if you just want to surrender now.

07:26.120 --> 07:30.125
You didn't really think
I came all by myself, did you?

07:32.520 --> 07:33.885
(GROWLS)

07:35.520 --> 07:38.046
Killer Croc? Oh, boy.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.205
Aw, you started without me?

07:43.360 --> 07:45.044
I'm a class act.

07:45.200 --> 07:50.047
I can't spend all night waiting for you
to haul your scaly butt up out of the sewer.

07:50.200 --> 07:54.569
Yeah? Well, go clean yourself as I finish
the job you should have been doing.

07:55.520 --> 08:00.890
- Nightwing, you know Croc.
- Oh, yeah. We've met.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.289
You've thickened up though, haven't you?

08:03.440 --> 08:05.920
You know, maybe you should cut out
snacks before bed.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.241
That's it.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.562
(GRUNTING)

08:19.600 --> 08:21.762

(GRUNTS)

08:34.039 --> 08:35.769
(GROANS)

08:35.919 --> 08:39.765
Finish the mission.
I'll take care of him.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.241
(ALARM BLARING)

08:44.560 --> 08:46.210
That'll work.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.770
CHEETAH: I figured
you'd want that back. It's done.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.650
Let's scram before Batman shows up.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.847
FLASH: Leaving?

09:08.120 --> 09:09.485
But I just got here.

09:09.640 --> 09:10.801
BOTH: Flash.

09:10.960 --> 09:14.567
Ugh. Great, what are you doing here?

09:14.720 --> 09:18.805
I've been tracking Croc since he robbed
the Central City copper quarry last week.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.327
KILLER CROC: He's everywhere.

09:25.480 --> 09:29.007
Ugh. I got hit harder than I thought.
I'm seeing five of you.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.844
It's cool, right?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.401
Nope, not even a little.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.483
I don't need your help.
I was doing fine.

09:35.640 --> 09:39.326
Is that why you tripped the alarm?
With me here, we could wrap this up quickly.

09:41.120 --> 09:44.010
I didn't think it was possible
but you're even uglier up close.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.528
That's nothing compared to the smell.
When's the last time you bathed?

09:47.680 --> 09:51.401
I get it. You're a giant walking talking
crocodile but have some standards, man.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.050
It kind of tickles. How's about this?

09:55.200 --> 09:56.406
(GRUNTS)

09:58.200 --> 09:59.406
NIGHTWING: Uh-uh-uh.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.927
We never finished our dance.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.048
(BOTH GRUNTING)

10:11.040 --> 10:13.042
(GROANS)

10:14.000 --> 10:15.126
(FLASH GROANS)

10:18.520 --> 10:21.205
- Gone.
- Anyone here?

10:21.360 --> 10:24.125
Nope. Not here either.
How about here? Nada. No.

10:24.280 --> 10:27.363
- Yeah, they're gone, all right.
- Batman should know about this.

10:27.560 --> 10:32.407
- That was a weird team-up, wasn't it?
- Them? Or us?

10:33.560 --> 10:35.403
TouchÃ©.

10:56.520 --> 11:00.525
(BEEPING)

11:17.800 --> 11:22.681
Checkpoint complete.
Initiating next phase.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.326
What happened?

11:39.480 --> 11:42.211
GREEN ARROW:
A talking gorilla robbing a bank?

11:43.240 --> 11:45.242
Now I've seen everything.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.130
Ah, Green Arrow happened.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.770
I'll have to remedy that.

11:50.440 --> 11:55.287
I get it. You're like Gorilla Grodd light.
All the gorilla, none of the brains.

11:56.040 --> 12:00.967
I am Silverback. You are toast.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.648
Smokescreen arrow. Patent pending.

12:12.800 --> 12:17.169
Your smoke is immaterial.
Switching to heat sensor.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.161
Wait, what now?

12:26.320 --> 12:28.163
That didn't go the way I expected.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.685
(GRUNTS)

12:32.360 --> 12:34.169
Nightwing, what happened?

12:35.200 --> 12:36.610
NIGHTWING: Something weird.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.842
I'm uploading the footage
to your subnet now.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.084
BATMAN: Croc and Cheetah
working together? That's new.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.760
- I figured you would want to know.
- BATMAN: And The Flash.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.684
Yeah, that guy.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.683
Mentioned a copper quarry.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.205
That's not Croc's MO.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.807
NIGHTWING: Maybe it's the Midas asteroid
passing the Earth. Making everyone crazy?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.684
BATMAN: I'm here, Alfred.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.611
I'm afraid I have yet another
animal-related crime...

13:03.800 --> 13:05.882
and it's in progress as we speak.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.929
Upload the coordinates. I'm on my way.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.289
Nightwing, see if you can track
where Cheetah and Croc slunk off to.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.044
NIGHTWING: Got it.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.842
(GRUNTING)

13:22.320 --> 13:23.890
Here goes nothing.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.644
Impossible. No one could make that shot.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.487
(YELLS)

13:36.320 --> 13:38.243
GREEN ARROW:
Impossible's my middle name.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.324
Actually, my middle name is Jonas.
But I'm not telling you that.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.561
(YELLS)

13:48.680 --> 13:50.011
(GROWLS)

14:01.920 --> 14:04.207
You're a sight for sore eyes,
Bats... Batman?

14:04.640 --> 14:05.971
(SCREECHING)

14:09.640 --> 14:15.409
You have it backwards. Meet Man-Bat.
We are the Animilitia.

14:15.560 --> 14:18.450
The what? More like the zoo crew.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.969
Mock us if you must,
but you will not stop us.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.963
Maybe not. But he will.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.763
Use your sonic-tip arrow.
Scramble his radar.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.683
On it.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.446
(SCREAMING)

14:41.080 --> 14:44.323
We got what we came for.
Activating back-up.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.971
(GRUNTS)

15:03.520 --> 15:05.522
(GRUNTING)

15:14.440 --> 15:18.161
- What is that?
- Back-up.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.289
(GRUNTS)

16:19.800 --> 16:24.567
So tell me, is it a full moon
or is every night in Gotham this weird?

16:29.040 --> 16:31.327
I hate when he does that.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.083
- THUG: Boo!
- WOMAN: Aah!

16:47.240 --> 16:49.607
(THUGS LAUGHING)

16:53.120 --> 16:55.282
Hey, get a load of this guy.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.127
(SQUAWKING AND LAUGHING)

17:10.200 --> 17:14.444
Oh. Humanity,
you never fail to disappoint me.

17:16.599 --> 17:22.960
Gentlemen, I recall when I too was blind
to the precariousness of human nature.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.842
THUG: Hey guys, turns out
he talks as funny as he looks.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.002
(THUGS LAUGHING)

17:31.520 --> 17:37.323
Unaware that with the slightest nudge
the world could crash down around me.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.131
(GASPS)

17:42.640 --> 17:44.085
(GRUNTS)

17:50.720 --> 17:53.007
Nobody does that to my cousin.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.091
(GRUNTING)

18:07.600 --> 18:09.682
Thank you for the exercise, gentlemen.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.650
I found it bracing.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.202
(GRUNTING)

18:48.240 --> 18:50.004
How's the new suit working?

18:50.560 --> 18:52.562
Good, but needs some adjustments.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.690
The gorilla called himself Silverback.

18:55.840 --> 18:59.162
Other than a penchant for computerized
gadgets, I've got nothing on him.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.203
I've got even less on the other one.

19:01.360 --> 19:05.001
Man-Bat is exactly what he seems,
a man-sized bat.

19:05.720 --> 19:06.881
Curious.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.007
You see that combo?

19:11.160 --> 19:13.811
Yeah, you're still dropping
your shoulder.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.090
Red Robin saves the day again.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.449
BATMAN: Elsewhere, reports of Killer Croc
and Cheetah teaming up.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.729
Together they broke out of Arkham Asylum
about three months ago...

19:25.880 --> 19:28.929
and have been on a crime spree since.
I believe they're related.

19:29.080 --> 19:33.449
- Maybe cousins. At best.
- No, the crimes are related.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.761
Oh.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.605
Yeah, I guess that makes more sense.

19:40.800 --> 19:45.840
SILVERBACK: (ON RECORDING) We are
the Animilitia. You will not stop us.

19:49.080 --> 19:53.563
Four animal-themed villains working together?
Why? What's the angle?

19:53.720 --> 19:57.441
BATMAN: It's not just them, Red Robin.
There's also these.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.804
Try not to break them.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.247
Then build them smarter.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.044
You always say there's a pattern.
So, what's the pattern?

20:12.200 --> 20:15.488
Map all the robberies and break-ins
committed by the Animilitia.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.924
Include all possible crimes committed
by robotic animals.

20:23.960 --> 20:28.170
All 11 crime scenes
form a circle around this spot.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.326
ALFRED: Ah, The Aviary.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.649
Gotham's newest tallest building.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.484
BATMAN:
It's a massive feat of engineering.

20:37.640 --> 20:40.962
Built by the only surviving member
of a wealthy high-society family...

20:41.120 --> 20:43.770
Oswald Cobblepot invested
his inheritance...

20:43.920 --> 20:47.766
and seven years of his life
to construct this tower.

20:47.920 --> 20:52.448
By the way, Bruce Wayne is expected
to appear at the grand opening tonight.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.325
Your tuxedo and invitation
are ready for you upstairs.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.171
Try not to be late as usual.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.084
(CHATTERING)

21:20.240 --> 21:21.844
(ELEGANT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

21:39.320 --> 21:42.050
- Good evening, Commissioner Gordon.
- If you say so, Wayne.

21:42.200 --> 21:46.184
I hate these kind of things. I spend
the entire time dodging old ladies...

21:46.334 --> 21:48.483
who think I can fix the potholes
on their block.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.689
- Well, at least the building is impressive.
- I guess so.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.126
But why build it?

21:53.280 --> 21:58.127
Might just be the cop in me,
but I think Cobblepot's up to something.

21:58.640 --> 22:03.009
Bruce? Bruce Wayne.
Over here, dear heart.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.650
Good evening, Miss Windsmere.

22:05.840 --> 22:10.970
Miss Windsmere? How could you, Bruce?

I'm impressed. But I still think
I can do something you can't.

43:37.320 --> 43:39.368
I can stop.

43:43.720 --> 43:47.725
I'm getting routine movement function
but nothing from higher core processes.

43:47.880 --> 43:52.044
I can try to reroute,
but this is some next level engineering.

43:52.600 --> 43:55.729
Agreed. These things are built
to be tough and fast.

43:55.880 --> 43:58.565
Langstrom is a genius.

43:59.280 --> 44:01.282
Wiring is mostly copper.

44:01.440 --> 44:03.807
Which explains why Croc
was at the copper quarry.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.962
You guys want me to take a look
at anything?

44:06.760 --> 44:11.243
Why don't you cop a squat, motormouth?
The adults are working.

44:15.520 --> 44:18.922
Can I get Wi-Fi in here? No?

44:22.080 --> 44:26.768
What are you playing at, Cobblepot?
Something's not right.

44:26.920 --> 44:28.684
What do you mean?

44:29.160 --> 44:32.607
- These robberies. In the last three, these...
- Animaniacs.

44:32.760 --> 44:35.843
Good one. I was gonna say
The Furry Four.

44:36.600 --> 44:38.443
Ha. How about the Flea Circus?

44:39.320 --> 44:43.245
As I was saying,
in the last three robberies...

44:43.400 --> 44:46.529
the robbers left behind
what they supposedly broke in for.

44:48.160 --> 44:49.889
- Because we stopped them.
- No.

44:50.080 --> 44:53.970
Because they weren't there to take anything.
They were there to leave something.

44:54.120 --> 44:57.920
But what? We'll never hack these robots
without the man that created them.

44:58.080 --> 45:00.367
- We need Langstrom.
- How do we find him?

45:00.520 --> 45:04.320
(BEEPING)

45:04.520 --> 45:06.807
Ah. That's the tracker we put on him.

45:06.960 --> 45:09.645
Looks like the Animilitia has him
at Bumbershoot Mechanics.

45:09.800 --> 45:12.963
Let's get him.
Nightwing, Arrow, you're with me.

45:13.360 --> 45:17.206
Robin, find a way to hack these things.
I need to know what Cobblepot is planning.

45:17.880 --> 45:19.405
What about me?

45:19.560 --> 45:23.645
I need you to check every robbery location.
See if you can find what they left behind.

45:23.800 --> 45:25.404
Do it fast.

45:27.640 --> 45:29.802
Fast, he says.

45:37.160 --> 45:38.650
(LAUGHS)

45:38.800 --> 45:40.484
Just leave it alone.

45:40.640 --> 45:42.768
Ah, my animal allies.

45:42.920 --> 45:47.926
- Report. Is our last receiver in place?
- Affirmative, Penguin.

45:48.080 --> 45:53.610
It went down just like you said it would,
boss. Nobody suspects a thing.

45:53.760 --> 45:58.243
Excellent. The Midas Heart
asteroid passes in less than 20 hours.

45:58.440 --> 46:01.171
That's when we will strike.

46:22.040 --> 46:26.204
We'll sneak in, free Langstrom,
and get out. On my mark.

46:36.760 --> 46:39.684
He should be directly below us.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.481
Now.

46:46.080 --> 46:48.526
Surprise, bucko.

46:52.920 --> 46:54.330
It's the archer.

46:54.480 --> 46:56.528
That was my favorite hat.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.001
End him!

47:12.160 --> 47:14.481
Okay, they're after me.
Just like you said.

47:27.720 --> 47:32.089
- It's Batman. He found us.
- Stop him!

47:32.280 --> 47:33.441
(YELLS)

47:36.920 --> 47:38.445
(SCREECHES)

47:44.200 --> 47:46.202
(BOTH GRUNTING)

47:50.440 --> 47:53.284
Stay still, jumping bean.

48:04.520 --> 48:05.851
(GRUNTS)

48:06.560 --> 48:11.327
If you want anything done right,
you have to do it yourself.

48:11.480 --> 48:13.323
Get rid of him.

48:13.920 --> 48:16.241
With pleasure, Mr. Penguin.

48:23.160 --> 48:25.481
- Flash.
- I got him.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.541
I can't believe you saved me.

48:36.691 --> 48:40.006
Me too. I've never run up a building before.
I'm kind of shocked that it worked.

48:40.156 --> 48:41.809
Wait. What?

48:48.680 --> 48:50.364
Langstrom?

48:52.120 --> 48:54.691
Just relax. This won't hurt a bit.

48:57.480 --> 49:00.370
(SCREECHES)

49:23.040 --> 49:26.123
Now what? You can't take us both.

49:29.560 --> 49:30.686
He doesn't have to.

50:03.040 --> 50:04.530
(GROWLS)

50:10.600 --> 50:14.605
You know what? You're so ugly,
I think it's an improvement.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.922
Come, my Animilitia.

50:17.080 --> 50:22.211
We still have much to do
before the fireworks begin.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.323
(GRUNTS)

50:37.400 --> 50:40.131
- The bad guys got away.
- BATMAN: Not all of them.

50:44.160 --> 50:48.643
Great. We got the one that doesn't talk.
What is he gonna be able to tell us?

51:01.600 --> 51:04.410
RED ROBIN: Are we absolutely certain
Langstrom is Man-Bat?

51:04.560 --> 51:06.289
BATMAN: It's him.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.680
(MAT-BAT SCREECHES)

51:09.120 --> 51:11.521
- Maybe the tracker fell off?
- I got it.

51:11.680 --> 51:14.286
Man-Bat stole Langstrom's pants.

51:15.160 --> 51:20.450
Man-Bat's blood contains human DNA bonded
with extracted genetic material from a bat.

51:20.600 --> 51:24.082
Dr. Kirk Langstrom,
a zoologist with a focus on bats...

51:24.240 --> 51:28.040
rumored to have created a serum
to grant humans a bat-like sonar sense...

51:28.200 --> 51:30.168
to assist the deaf and the blind.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.846
It was a noble
but incredibly experimental idea.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.970
- You think he tested it on himself?
- BATMAN: I do.

51:36.120 --> 51:39.408
I've analyzed his research,
and I think Langstrom is trapped...

51:39.560 --> 51:41.608
transformed into Man-Bat.

51:41.760 --> 51:45.321
I think The Penguin gave the creature
a place to belong in his Animilitia.

51:45.480 --> 51:48.848
And if my calculations are correct,
the antidote I've synthesized...

51:49.040 --> 51:52.203
should return him to human form
for three hours.

51:56.960 --> 51:58.803
(SCREECHES)

52:15.400 --> 52:16.561
Whoa.

52:16.720 --> 52:20.247
- Amazing.
- I'm definitely gonna vomit.

52:20.400 --> 52:23.324
Oh, no. Batman?

52:23.480 --> 52:25.403
- Did I hurt anyone?
- No, doctor.

52:25.560 --> 52:28.006
You're under a temporary antidote
for your condition.

52:28.200 --> 52:31.329
If you could help us, perhaps
we might be able to make it permanent.

52:31.480 --> 52:34.245
I would like nothing more, Batman.

52:34.400 --> 52:36.641
In the field,
I knew they would need protection...

52:36.840 --> 52:40.561
so higher functions are re-routed
through to a secondary A.I.

52:40.760 --> 52:43.240
Of course. That's how you did it.

52:45.840 --> 52:48.730
Increase in current flow
allows superior speed and strength.

52:48.880 --> 52:52.282
But the parts remain interchangeable.
That's brilliant.

52:56.280 --> 52:57.805
So this is a transmitter.

52:57.960 --> 53:03.330
Oh, yes, The Penguin insisted on a specific
dual vibrational transmission.

53:13.480 --> 53:15.687
BATMAN: Tell me what you know
of The Penguin's plan.

53:15.840 --> 53:17.444
Not much I'm afraid.

53:17.600 --> 53:21.161
I was only supposed to design cyber-animals
for an unmanned exploration...

53:21.320 --> 53:23.368
- ...and retrieval mission.
- Retrieval?

53:23.520 --> 53:27.127
- Like digging through rubble?
- Yes. Of course.

53:27.560 --> 53:31.281
NIGHTWING: You were right, Batman.
The robberies were just covers.

53:31.440 --> 53:34.808
BATMAN: Hmm. There's a reason the Aviary
is at the center of all of these robberies.

53:34.960 --> 53:37.930
- Looks like an umbrella.
- It's a force field.

53:38.080 --> 53:39.605
- Why?
- I don't know.

53:39.760 --> 53:42.650
But this antenna is built to aim
at something.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.644
Something that would require
a force field to withstand.

53:45.800 --> 53:48.804
And my robots to pick through
the wreckage afterwards.

53:48.960 --> 53:51.725
What could possibly cause
that much destruction?

53:55.480 --> 53:56.811
BATMAN: The Midas Heart.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.890
The Penguin is going to crash
an asteroid into Gotham City.

54:00.040 --> 54:02.691
He's going to use the robots
to sort through the rubble...

54:02.880 --> 54:07.010
- to retrieve the gold at the center of it.
- With three robots? That could take years.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.731
Come on. We better get prepared.

54:19.960 --> 54:25.808
PENGUIN: (OVER RADIO)
Come to me. Come home, my darlings.

54:35.280 --> 54:39.649
Careful with that, you dolt.
That operates the tractor beam.

54:39.800 --> 54:45.842
- Why isn't my force field operational yet?
- Twenty more seconds, Penguin.

54:48.440 --> 54:52.525
Ah, my darlings,
you've made it home just in time...

54:52.720 --> 54:57.009
for the big bang
and the rain of gold to follow.

54:57.160 --> 55:00.881
Go, join your bionic brethren.

55:09.400 --> 55:12.449
It's working. It's working.

55:13.120 --> 55:15.407
Tractor beam locked in.

55:16.920 --> 55:21.448
PENGUIN: Do it. Destroy Gotham City.

55:54.840 --> 55:57.650
(WHISTLING)

56:00.720 --> 56:01.767
(GRUNTS)

56:15.280 --> 56:16.281
(BOTH YELLING)

56:45.920 --> 56:48.127
BATMAN: Your help has been
invaluable, Dr. Langstrom.

56:48.280 --> 56:51.841
- I hate to do this.
- No, Batman, I understand.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.482
Lock me up so I can no longer
assist this mad Penguin.

56:55.680 --> 56:57.967
- Maybe the antidote will work again.
- No.

56:58.120 --> 57:00.600
The serum has already
mutated and adapted.

57:02.600 --> 57:05.080
But he helped us.
We can't just leave him locked up.

57:05.840 --> 57:09.447
It's okay. It's better this way.

57:16.920 --> 57:19.924
(GRUNTING)

57:25.920 --> 57:27.410
Batman, you should see this.

57:27.560 --> 57:32.964
Greetings to the pathetic
and doomed denizens of Gotham City...

57:33.120 --> 57:37.170
who dared to grace me
with their sidelong glances...

57:37.320 --> 57:41.290
frightened whispers
and withering disrespect.

57:41.440 --> 57:44.967
I am Oswald Cobblepot...

57:45.120 --> 57:49.808
but you may call me The Penguin.

57:50.840 --> 57:52.569
Gather round, children.

57:52.720 --> 57:58.807
For I am certain many of you are wondering
about the spectacular light show in the sky.

57:58.960 --> 58:02.328
It's of my doing. And it's all for you.

58:02.480 --> 58:06.929
Well, your ultimate demise anyway.

58:07.080 --> 58:08.366
(MURMURING)

58:08.520 --> 58:14.607
You see, the Midas Heart is no longer going
to harmlessly whiz past the Earth.

58:14.800 --> 58:17.929
I have altered its path
with my tractor beam.

58:18.080 --> 58:23.405
And now, I will crash
the Midas Heart asteroid into Gotham.

58:23.600 --> 58:28.686
Don't worry about me. I'll be safely
ensconced behind my force field.

58:28.840 --> 58:34.210
And after you are gone, I will recover
the gold at the center of the asteroid...

58:34.400 --> 58:37.085
and live happily, wealthily...

58:37.280 --> 58:40.090
and free of your pathetic judgment.

58:40.280 --> 58:44.285
Goodbye, Gotham City. Forever.

58:45.120 --> 58:47.964
- You all right?
- I've never done anything like this before.

58:48.120 --> 58:50.691
I can try to vibrate my frequency
on a molecular level...

58:50.880 --> 58:52.723
But if you screw it up? Going that fast?

58:52.920 --> 58:55.969
You're gonna splat against
that force field like a bug.

58:59.880 --> 59:01.564
(SIGHS)

59:03.640 --> 59:08.009
Calm down. You can do it.
I believe in you.

59:10.240 --> 59:12.129
Thanks, man. I needed that.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.970
Oh, come on. All right, just...
Please, just get off me.

59:17.720 --> 59:20.690
There's no way we're getting
a car through all that.

59:20.840 --> 59:22.729
Not a problem.

59:29.160 --> 59:30.525
This is Commissioner Gordon.

59:30.680 --> 59:33.126
We've got your entire
building surrounded, Penguin.

59:33.280 --> 59:37.080
Give yourself up
or we'll be forced to bust our way in.

59:37.240 --> 59:41.962
You're welcome to try, commissioner.
Go on, give it a shot.

59:42.120 --> 59:44.248
I dare you.

59:45.240 --> 59:47.811
Crack that shield open.
We have to get in there.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.245
- OFFICER: What now, Commissioner Gordon?
- I don't know. I just don't know.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.363
Take your best shot, Batman.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.883
Let me try.
If I can get inside that force field...

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.522
I don't know what you're going to do
that we haven't already hit it with.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.489
I'm going to walk right through it.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:58.450
He can't do that.
He can't match my shield's frequency.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.365
Where did he get a transmitter?

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.409
Langstrom. Curse him.
Silverback, send down the robots.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.085
How many?

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.760
All of them. Tear him apart.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.446
Flash, now.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.611
(GRUNTS)

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.805
Ace, come.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.646
- Batman's hacked the robots.
- This is foul play.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.370
He's brainwashed my babies.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.727
Destroy him, my cyber children.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.450
Crush him in your pneumatic jaws.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:19.004
Show the Batman he has no place
in our animal kingdom.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.481
BATMAN: (OVER RADIO) Flash,
it's up to you. Get that shield down.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.044
You got this.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.526
I made it. I'm in.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.684
Now you need to take out a receiver at one
of the robbery sites and get this shield down.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.730
Give me a chance to catch my breath.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.648
If I were a receiver, where would I be?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.241
Follow the beam, right?

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.411
(GRUNTS)

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.166
Great, they upgraded.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.765
(GRUNTS)

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.129
Here, boy.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.729
Yes, the shield is down. Uploading now.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.722
Don't worry, Bats. We've got your back.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.562
(GRUNTING)

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.490
- Where are we with the upload?
- Over halfway. Sixty-five percent.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.170
The asteroid is still headed
right for us.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:27.168
- And without the force field...
- Survival probability at 0.0 percent.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.125
Well, that's my cue to exit, I believe.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.450
Trust me, it's been a thin slice of heaven
working with each of you.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.365
What? Where are you going?

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:44.243
I would take you, but silly me,
I only built my escape pod for one.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.201
Turncoat! Traitor!

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.247
I bid you adieu.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.884
Penguin's getting away.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.882
(GRUNTING)

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:22.010
- Where's my upload?
- Ninety-seven percent. Almost there.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.721
Oh, no.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.525
(SCREECHES)

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.410
Dr. Langstrom, please.
I know you can hear me.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.767
We're trying to help you.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.082
I'm sorry, doctor.
I can't let you do this.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:04.330
- The computer virus worked. Good job, Robin.
- RED ROBIN: Oh, great. Good to hear.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.370
- You sound distracted. Everything okay?
- Yeah, fine. I should go.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.002
Dr. Langstrom, please.
Your body is changed, but not your mind.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.844
Concentrate.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.126
(SCREECHES)

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.005
(YELLS)

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.566
Dr. Langstrom?

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.881
I knew you could do it.
Let's get to the others.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.642
CHEETAH: We've got to get out of here.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.689
BATMAN: I don't think so.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.089
We're leaving. Even if we have
to go through you.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.481
Take them.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.484
Wait a minute.
I thought you worked for us.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:53.247
Explanation: our androids
have been compromised.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.007
(SNARLING, GRUNTING AND YELLING)

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.242
So the bad guys are down,
but what about the giant flaming rock?

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.687
Can we reverse the polarity
of that tractor beam?

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.367
I could. But the controls are out.
I don't have the parts to replace them.

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.685
I have a better idea.
Here's what we need.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.968
Flash and Nightwing, collect parts.

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.522
Nightwing knows what I need.
Flash, you help him get them quickly.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.968
Arrow, find me a new power source
for this console.

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:55.285
- I got it. Now, how do we get up there?
- Maybe we can help.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.984
BATMAN: I'm going to rewire that antenna.
Flash, you're not done.

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.987
I need you to collect
the remaining receivers.

01:09:04.136 --> 01:09:06.920
- Put them at the edges of Gotham.
- Gotcha.

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.336
Are you certain, doctor?

01:09:30.586 --> 01:09:33.252
You'll have to fly above the antenna
in order to focus the signal.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.921
Flash?

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.524
Last one. Finished.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.166
- Arrow? You ready?
- Levels are good, Bats.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.970
So this is gonna shoot that asteroid
back into space?

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.361
BATMAN: No. It's going
to pull it towards us faster.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.124
Right. Wait. What?

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.285
Can't reverse the trajectory. I've rewired
the force field. Flash moved the receivers.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.727
If my calculations are correct,
we should be safe.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.882
- GREEN ARROW: And if they aren't?
- They are. Now.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.643
(SCREECHING)

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.970
It's working.
Just a few more seconds, doctor.

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.690
(SCREECHES)

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.122
Come on, doc, you can do it.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.808
Brace for impact. Here it comes.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.568
Oh, man, I can't look.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.244
(CHEERING)

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.890
(SCREECHING)

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.840
Gotham owes you a debt of gratitude,
doctor.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.005
- LANGSTROM: Did we win?
- We did. Thanks to you.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.649
Thank Robin.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.247
He believed I was still trapped
in that nightmare.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:21.522
No, I... Well, actually that's all true.

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:24.645
BATMAN: Doctor, it looks as if
the tractor beam power surge

01:12:24.795 --> 01:12:26.421
burnt out all traces of the serum.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.082
According to this,
you won't be seeing the Man-Bat again.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:34.922
Thank you, Batman.
Thank you for giving me my life back.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.609
You can't keep me locked up
like some kind of animal.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:53.887
I hate prison. The food is terrible.
And the portions are so tiny.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.884
You haven't seen the last of us.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:06.286
So, you know, thanks, and stuff.
For believing in me.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.809
Yeah. It's cool.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.491
- We'll have to do it again.
- Sure. Whenever.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:17.248
- Because I really...
- Dude, for the fastest guy alive...

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.482
you give the slowest goodbyes.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.846
See you around, Bats.
Never a dull moment in Gotham City.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.571
It's just a shame that Penguin got away.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.169
Race you home.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.931
Ace.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.768
Greek Isles my foot.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.964
Nothing ever works
like it's supposed to.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.124
Thickheaded guidance system.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.040
Oh.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.123
No. Stay away.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.167
No. No. No. Leave me alone!

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.605
Have you no sense of personal space?

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.650
I'll get you, Batman!

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.202
