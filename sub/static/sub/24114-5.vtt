WEBVTT

00:08.550 --> 00:10.218
<i>Previously on You Me Her...</i>

00:10.301 --> 00:11.678
I told you, Izzy,
this was a mistake.

00:11.761 --> 00:13.805
You walk out that door,
you are dead to me.

00:14.431 --> 00:17.058
Are you sure you left
for the right reasons

00:17.142 --> 00:19.102
and you're still getting
a divorce on Monday

00:19.185 --> 00:20.770
-Yes.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.522
We agreed that before
we started talking

00:22.605 --> 00:25.275
about nannies and daycare,
the girls would be 3 years old.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.776
What's wrong with your entire
generation of men?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.153
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:28.236 --> 00:31.156
Well, when I was a kid, my dad
used to leave me at a bar

00:31.239 --> 00:33.199
-while he did God knows what in the back.
-Huh.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.577
How long are you gonna
keep showing up like this?

00:35.660 --> 00:37.829
Until you forgive me
or my project ends.

00:37.912 --> 00:40.915
You know, what would look really good
on this tiny finger right there? Jack, I have an idea.
Why don't I propose to you?

00:46.546 --> 00:48.506
-I almost proposed to Jack.
-That's awesome.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.134
Nina, why is Shaun
cooking dinner in your kitchen?

00:51.217 --> 00:53.219
-You're pregnant.
-I am that.

00:53.303 --> 00:57.057
-Ky, I'm sorry. It was a massive mistake.
-I'll go with you.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.809
You have a right to know.

01:11.696 --> 01:14.199
Jack, did you hear what I said?

01:14.282 --> 01:16.284
Yeah, um...

01:18.453 --> 01:20.497
When you say
I have a right to know...

01:20.914 --> 01:21.998
we're talking about...

01:23.083 --> 01:24.000
Mm-hmm.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.216
So what happens now?

01:32.050 --> 01:35.178
Haven't really had a chance
to explore my options.

01:38.223 --> 01:41.935
Kylie offered... to take me.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.812
I-I didn't say yes.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.607
I also didn't say no.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.114
-Jack...

01:54.531 --> 01:55.865
Jack, can we just...

01:56.950 --> 01:59.869
Can we just sit down and talk
about this like grownups?

01:59.953 --> 02:02.038
Yeah, I'm supposed
to be playing it cool, I guess.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.457
That's how you want me to react?
Please.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.668
I'm intrigued. Tell me more
about your plan to abort the baby

02:06.751 --> 02:08.670
we've been trying to have
for the last seven years.

02:08.753 --> 02:12.215
Okay, can you tone down the righteous
indignation to a seven or an eight, huh?

02:12.298 --> 02:14.467
We both agreed what happened
was a huge mistake.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.427
So it's pretty fucking
complicated, Jack.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.471
You know, we shouldn't have
this conversation here.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.472
What

02:19.556 --> 02:22.308
Because Izzy has a meeting
with her thesis counsellor right now.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.727
<i>The Myth of Polyfidelity.</i>

02:26.354 --> 02:28.273
Great premise. Well done.

02:28.356 --> 02:32.193
Thanks. Uh, I call it
"the communism of relationships"

02:32.277 --> 02:35.238
because it's way better in theory
than it is on its feet.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.115
Fascinating.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.952
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

02:41.035 --> 02:44.164
I'm familiar with
the concept of polyamory.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.999
Oh. Okay.

02:46.082 --> 02:50.587
Uh, well, polyfidelity is
the fucktarded effort

02:50.670 --> 02:54.924
to make polyamory exclusive
and... and permanent, or so I've read.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.385
Why are you so afraid of Izzy?

02:57.802 --> 03:00.597
She would freak out if she knew
I was talking to you right now.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.764
-She hates you.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.893
Your caller ID on her phone
is "Dead to Me."

03:05.184 --> 03:08.396
She didn't return her father's calls for
over a year, and he only left her once.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.398
I'm meeting him tonight,
by the way.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.526
-That's a big step.
-I know.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.528
I've had the engagement ring
in my underwear drawer

03:15.612 --> 03:18.031
-for five weeks now.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.867
Well, not one to drag
your feet, are you, Jack?

03:20.950 --> 03:22.702
Remind me, how quickly
did you jump uteruses?

03:22.785 --> 03:24.412
Or... or is it uteri?

03:24.495 --> 03:26.289
Feeling fucking wounded,
Em, are you?

03:26.372 --> 03:28.750
Okay, well, look at it from
my fucking point of view, okay?

03:28.833 --> 03:31.836
My ex-wife shows up in slippers
to tell me that her new girlfriend

03:31.920 --> 03:33.963
is gonna be escorting her
to the Abortion Ball.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.257
-Okay, that's so fucking offensive.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.593
In the way that I am
fucking pregnant.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.391
Holy shit.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.436
Yeah.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.688
Aside from the obvious;

03:50.772 --> 03:54.025
cultural conditioning,
insecurity, jealousy,

03:54.108 --> 03:58.321
why do you think
polyfidelity is, uh...

03:58.821 --> 03:59.739
"fucktarded"?

04:01.324 --> 04:02.951
Hello?

04:03.034 --> 04:04.452
Izzy?

04:05.620 --> 04:07.664
I'm 38 years old.
I live in Seattle,

04:07.747 --> 04:10.333
where I'm gonna be
managing partner at my firm.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.043
I'm with a woman who has
literally said

04:12.126 --> 04:14.420
on multiple occasions
these three words:

04:14.504 --> 04:16.047
"Babies are gross."

04:16.130 --> 04:17.215
Is that...

04:18.466 --> 04:20.760
-Dr. Trakarsky --
-Jesus! Wear a bell.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.888
So sorry. That came out
very disrespectful.

04:24.639 --> 04:28.893
Well, is there a respectful way
to tell your advisor to wear a bell?

04:29.394 --> 04:31.562
What is she doing here?

04:32.063 --> 04:34.107
Unbelievable.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.860
-I don't know.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.113
That's why I haven't RSVP'd
to the Abortion Ball.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.953
Maybe you decided
you didn't want kids

04:47.036 --> 04:49.038
when you realized
you couldn't have them.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.833
You really think now is
the time for "I told you so's"?

04:54.002 --> 04:57.714
Actually, I think this should be
the happiest moment of both of our lives.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.303
Don't have an abortion.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.351
We can figure something out.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.816
Will you at least...
think about it?

05:18.776 --> 05:21.446
I will. I promise.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.408
Don't say anything to Izzy.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.243
Not now.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.371
She and I are just about
to go all in together, and...

05:32.290 --> 05:33.750
You are, um...

05:35.585 --> 05:37.211
undecided.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.432
Are you lost?

05:52.143 --> 05:53.519
Couldn't make it in the big city?

05:53.603 --> 05:56.189
Rode the rails back to Portland?

05:56.981 --> 05:59.233
These are my driving clothes.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.735
I like to be comfortable.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.029
Well, how about we just cut
straight to the part

06:03.112 --> 06:05.281
where you tell me
what the fuck is going on?

06:05.364 --> 06:08.367
I am staying at the Carlyle.
I went for a walk.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.369
It's right over there, just a mile.

06:10.953 --> 06:14.290
-Forgot my sneaks.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.169
Okay. And you didn't tell Jack
you were gonna be in town?

06:18.252 --> 06:20.922
Meeting came together
at the last minute, so...

06:21.005 --> 06:23.508
-You can ask him.
-Oh. I will.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.343
Maybe I'll give you
a call at the Carlyle.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.553
Well, I'm not there.
I'm here. So...

06:27.637 --> 06:29.388
You know, just to see
if you're registered.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.642
Izzy, I don't know why
we can't be amicable.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.977
I-I know that what happened
at the loft--

06:35.061 --> 06:38.147
Look, just stop dropping
in and out of our lives.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.108
Let us move forward.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.194
Okay.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.183
Yeah, 8's good,
assuming Jack's still alive by then.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.726
Oh, no. He's perfectly healthy.

07:15.810 --> 07:19.480
But people inexplicably fall out of
windows every day in this country.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.107
Google it.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.693
Okay. Bye.

07:28.364 --> 07:31.033
Okay.
Okay, Silva. Be cool, be cool.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.411
Just don't be that girl.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.912
Just...

07:42.044 --> 07:44.964
I get... I get that I'm coming off
a little nutty over here.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.425
I'm actually caffeine
sensitive and I just threw back,

07:47.508 --> 07:51.095
like, four cups of Kenyan Dark, so...

07:52.680 --> 07:55.641
Okay, now I hear you wondering
why I would drink four cups of Kenyan Dark if I have
a caffeine sensitivity.

07:58.769 --> 08:02.899
Well... maybe that's why
I'm seeing the head shrinker.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.817
Did you ever think of that?

08:08.237 --> 08:09.572
-Hey.
-Hi.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.073
-Bumblebutt.
Yeah.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.039
-Good. Fine.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.835
Are you a steak guy? Is it weird
that I don't know that?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.462
We're all steak guys.

08:24.545 --> 08:28.299
Some of us just pretend we're not
so we can get laid by pale skinny women.

08:28.382 --> 08:29.383
Hmm.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.178
Speaking of pale, skinny women...

08:32.261 --> 08:34.013
You... you saw Emma, too?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.184
Everyone lived?

08:38.267 --> 08:41.103
-Not in my imagination.
-Mm.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.106
Bitterness is like drinking poison

08:44.190 --> 08:46.692
to kill your enemy,
young lady.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.946
-It's a saying. Uh...

08:52.156 --> 08:53.824
It felt like it was from the old times.

08:53.908 --> 08:58.454
Okay, so, um, why is, uh,
why is she here again?

08:58.538 --> 09:02.500
She was at a meeting,
and she's staying at the Carlyle.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.919
Mm. That's what she said.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.879
-Yeah, that's the gist of it.
-Right.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.673
So why is my Spidey sense screaming

09:12.635 --> 09:15.304
I don't know. I mean, you...
we've discussed this.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.474
You have no version
of a sixth sense at all.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.226
-Right.
-You're way below the mean

09:20.309 --> 09:22.478
-when it comes to basic human intuition.
-Oh.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.689
So nice try, but off target.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.400
What?

09:29.318 --> 09:30.695
Ow.

09:30.778 --> 09:31.988
Maybe don't shave.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.282
He's the one on trial, not you, right
-Mm-hmm.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.703
Yeah. I wanna make
a good first impression.

09:38.786 --> 09:42.456
Maybe I'll show up late, you know,
sweat pants on, half-drunk.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.916
That's perfect.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.210
-Yeah. It's perfect.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.838
Oh!  That...

09:48.921 --> 09:50.256
Okay.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.508
That's it?
-Yeah.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.676
All right.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.344
-I'll see ya.
-Mm-hmm.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.971
Yeah, have a good one.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.436
-Fuck me!

10:04.270 --> 10:06.188
Ugh. Mm.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.232
Hey, Carm?

10:09.025 --> 10:13.321
Hi. I just wanna stop by
and say that I love you,

10:13.404 --> 10:17.992
you know, before I go to Seattle
and probably get an abortion,

10:18.075 --> 10:20.745
and beg Kylie to forgive me.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.163
Oh, and yes,
I am mostly wearing

10:22.246 --> 10:24.123
the clothes that
I slept in last night.

10:24.206 --> 10:26.375
But for the record,
I did brush my teeth.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.550
Wouldn't that be hysterical?
Uh-huh.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.971
Okay, well, I just wanted to play
that clever little prank on you.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.849
So best to you and to yours.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.019
-You left some banana here.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.940
Kind of puts our little problem
into perspective, huh?

10:50.024 --> 10:54.654
Well, it's not little,
so no. No, it doesn't.

10:58.658 --> 11:02.578
So do you guys want to play
princesses or princesses?

11:02.662 --> 11:03.996
Princesses.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.998
All right.
To the treasure trunk!

11:14.090 --> 11:19.678
<i>♪ I don't feel your light ♪</i>

11:21.514 --> 11:26.894
<i>♪ I hear a storm inside ♪</i>

11:29.814 --> 11:34.819
<i>♪ Bridging like a great divide ♪</i>

11:35.653 --> 11:37.738
<i>♪ I'll be sleeping through... ♪</i>

11:37.822 --> 11:40.324
-Hm.
-That's okay. You just gotta aim better.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.119
So how about school?

11:43.911 --> 11:45.746
-Didn't work out too much.
-Mm.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.876
Nice one.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.007
You really should finish.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.718
You really should mind
your own business.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.804
Okay. Totally cool.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.347
Just getting
my volunteer hours.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.891
You don't know anything
about anything.

12:07.810 --> 12:11.939
I got kicked out junior year, but...
whatever.

12:13.816 --> 12:14.775
For what?

12:17.445 --> 12:21.240
Uh, when my dad bailed,
I went on a bit of a rampage.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.952
Drugs, skipping,
failing, fighting,

12:25.035 --> 12:26.745
all the things.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.498
I went to Algebra on acid.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.917
I do not recommend it.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.671
Hmm. And now,
you're a grad student.

12:35.754 --> 12:36.755
I am.

12:38.757 --> 12:39.884
Yeah.

12:39.967 --> 12:44.597
I tested into a granola bad kids school
and I graduated with honours.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.641
And then I wrote one hell
of a tear-jerker essay

12:47.725 --> 12:49.101
for my college apps.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.146
Mm-hmm. You're like a PSA.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.023
In the flesh.

12:56.233 --> 12:59.445
I can't enroll anyway.
I don't have an address.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.950
No family at all?

13:05.034 --> 13:08.537
No. Well, other than my grandma,
but we haven't talked in years.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.956
And she is <i>nuts.</i>

13:15.169 --> 13:17.254
Don't get that stupid
saviour look in your eye.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.340
Saviour... Me?

13:19.423 --> 13:20.966
No. No, no, no.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.093
That is not my thing. No.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.388
More of the acid-dropping,
pool-shark type.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.348
Mm.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.643
-Go ahead.
-Stop smiling. I'm serious.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.145
-No.

13:33.437 --> 13:37.024
Well, I know you <i>can't</i> smile,
but I'm allowed to smile.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.235
Go.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.949
Okay, so we've had a few cancellations
for the party tonight,

13:45.032 --> 13:46.951
but I think we've got
a good representation

13:47.034 --> 13:48.369
from the West Coast princesses, right?

13:48.452 --> 13:50.579
Now who was in charge of snacks?
Was that you, Callie Hmm...

13:52.873 --> 13:54.625
Oh, was that a little hiccup?

13:54.708 --> 13:56.710
Was it a magic hiccup
or just a regular one?

13:56.794 --> 13:58.587
You have to have your gloves.
That's important.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.173
Here we go. Your left.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.387
Okay, now can you make
your fingers like this?

14:06.470 --> 14:09.932
-Yeah.
Hey!

14:10.015 --> 14:12.893
I thought I heard a persistent ticking
in the background.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.563
In case you're not clear, that's another,
um, biological clock joke.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.773
You did it!
-I did it. We did it together.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.608
What do you want, honey?
This one?

14:23.863 --> 14:24.780
Done!

14:24.864 --> 14:29.493
All done.
You can be Princess Monsterface.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.205
That's a good name for you,
'cause you really do...

14:33.747 --> 14:34.957
Oh.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.834
Jeez, uh...

14:36.917 --> 14:38.919
is this about Emma and, um...

14:39.003 --> 14:41.422
Yeah, I mean, she came all this way
to tell me.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.132
That has to mean something, right?

14:43.215 --> 14:46.385
Why else would she just...
show up like that?

14:46.468 --> 14:50.264
Honestly, I'm, uh, punching out
of my weight class on this one.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.224
Is Carmen around?

14:52.308 --> 14:54.810
No, she ran after Emma.
Grand Central Station here.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.270
-Here you go, sweetie.
-Mm.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.772
What do you think, Princess Callie?
What should I do? -Twirl around.

15:01.358 --> 15:03.319
-Twirl.
-Oh.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.029
Ready

15:05.112 --> 15:07.364
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

15:07.448 --> 15:10.159
Do you want wings?
We have extra wings.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.619
No, I feel better already.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.871
-There you go.
-Thanks. Here.

15:15.664 --> 15:16.916
See?

15:24.298 --> 15:27.259
And then I'm thinking that
I'm gonna open up a, uh,

15:27.343 --> 15:29.261
my own practice, sex therapy,

15:29.345 --> 15:31.764
but with more of
a holistic approach, you know?

15:31.847 --> 15:33.474
That's so cool.

15:33.557 --> 15:34.850
And refreshing.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.477
How is that?

15:36.560 --> 15:38.687
Hey, I don't like it when
women impugn my entire gender

15:38.771 --> 15:40.856
like we're one giant organism,

15:40.940 --> 15:44.276
so I sure as hell don't want
to throw it back the other way.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.195
-But...

15:47.071 --> 15:48.864
Let's just say
it ain't easy out there.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.158
Word to that, my brother.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.330
Okay, time's up. Remember
the parameters of our--

15:56.413 --> 15:59.208
Yeah, I'm good for now,
but thanks... intrusive barkeep.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.795
-Right, but you... you told me that--
-No, seriously, I'm... I'm good.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.797
Gotcha. Fuck science, right?

16:06.840 --> 16:09.051
Oh, laughing.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.594
And how about you,
Captain Sensitive Pants?

16:10.678 --> 16:14.056
-Um... yeah.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.641
Yeah?

16:15.724 --> 16:17.434
-That's cool.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.019
Cool.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.729
I don't know.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.898
That was interesting.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.110
Yeah, I think they get a tax rebate
for employing him.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.444
I heard that.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.493
-Not to make this weird, but...

16:34.576 --> 16:36.370
I feel like I know you, Nina.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.418
Are you... did I--

16:42.501 --> 16:45.713
Did you just say,
"I see you, Nina Martone"?

16:45.796 --> 16:49.508
Actually, no, I said,
"I feel like I know you, Nina."

16:49.591 --> 16:51.468
Let me guess.
You, uh, you got it from

16:51.552 --> 16:53.929
<i>The Millennial Twat's Guide</i>
<i>to Getting Laid</i> by Andy Cutler?

16:54.013 --> 16:57.099
Wow, so I'm a twat now.
Nice.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.809
I'm clinging to
a thread of hope here.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.436
Uh, are you fucking with me?

17:00.519 --> 17:02.396
What... what does that
even mean, anyway?

17:02.479 --> 17:05.149
Like, um, like you can see my soul?

17:05.232 --> 17:08.402
The... the vulnerable little girl
that forever lives in my heart?

17:08.485 --> 17:10.571
And then, um, seven weeks later,
you wanna slow things down,

17:10.654 --> 17:12.364
which apparently is code for

17:12.448 --> 17:14.491
"I'm breaking up with you
in nine days"?

17:14.575 --> 17:16.452
Did you take an unfortunate
combination of drugs

17:16.535 --> 17:19.246
to prepare for this date?
Or are you just crazy?

17:22.750 --> 17:25.544
Ohh.
-Crazy it is.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.380
Okay. Yeah, I'd say drinks are
on the house instead of your...

17:28.464 --> 17:29.798
your crotch, but, uh...

17:29.882 --> 17:33.427
-She works here, so...
-Yeah. Cool.

17:35.721 --> 17:39.641
I-I need to admit
something to you, okay?

17:39.725 --> 17:41.185
So don't fuck it up.

17:42.811 --> 17:46.231
Okay, but I'm not that good
under pressure.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.776
I... have a...

17:51.320 --> 17:53.072
...pretty-girl ego.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.949
Oh, is that when I was
supposed to be surprised?

17:56.033 --> 17:58.619
But I've only
seriously opened myself up

17:58.702 --> 18:03.373
to two guys in my entire life,
and... and they both shat on my head.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.292
Disrespectful.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.962
And highly coincidental.
Did they know each other?

18:09.046 --> 18:12.257
I mean, were they part of, uh,
same scatological fraternity?

18:12.341 --> 18:14.009
Right?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.511
Listen, I think we've come up

18:15.594 --> 18:18.639
with the real question
of your thesis.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.850
Oh, fuck. Pfft!
Fine, whatever. I'll bite.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.936
What's the real question
of my thesis?

18:24.019 --> 18:25.938
"What is wrong with me?"

18:28.107 --> 18:29.733
Like you. You're saying it.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.360
You're saying,
"What is wrong with me?"

18:31.443 --> 18:33.570
You know?
Because you know that's true.

18:35.864 --> 18:39.535
Okay, um, let's clear
some shit up here, Shaun.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.078
First of all, fuck you

18:41.161 --> 18:43.664
and your latest annoying attempt
at bartender wisdom.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.333
Okay, don't do that. Don't put up
the Nina armour. I'm just--

18:46.416 --> 18:49.628
And I already have
a <i>mejor amiga,</i> fucking clown.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.898
Why do I get the sense
that you're correlating

19:09.982 --> 19:12.484
me sitting on a swing,
staring at a stuffed octopus,

19:12.568 --> 19:15.112
with my wanting to keep this baby?

19:15.195 --> 19:17.030
Am I even necessary
in this conversation?

19:17.114 --> 19:20.367
I should be in my car, on the way
back to Seattle right now.

19:20.450 --> 19:24.788
Yet here you are, sitting on a swing,
staring at an octopus.

19:24.872 --> 19:28.375
You know those people who are so deep
into Scientology they can't turn back?

19:28.458 --> 19:30.836
Even when they know
it's about tiny aliens?

19:31.211 --> 19:33.046
They just forge on because
it's easier than admitting

19:33.130 --> 19:35.132
how fucked up it all is.

19:37.050 --> 19:40.053
So you're saying Seattle's
your Church of Scientology?

19:40.137 --> 19:41.388
Yep.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.683
You don't seem surprised.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.019
Well, that's mostly because I'm not.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.608
Jack was right.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.736
I wasn't following my truths.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.613
I was running away.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.281
I mean...

19:59.990 --> 20:02.034
my job is awesome.

20:02.826 --> 20:06.038
And Kylie's... awesomer.

20:07.039 --> 20:11.627
Well, a lot of things are
awesome and awesomer.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.046
Em, what really matters is,

20:15.047 --> 20:16.840
what do you want?

20:18.717 --> 20:20.344
I want this baby.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.595
And?

20:24.056 --> 20:26.058
And I want my husband.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.144
And Izzy.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.816
Do you think Izzy will forgive me?

20:34.900 --> 20:37.986
Well, begging for forgiveness is
kind of your thing now, right?

20:38.070 --> 20:40.781
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
my grovel game is on point.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.243
Yellow roses.

20:44.326 --> 20:48.247
Did you just have a stroke and say
"yellow roses" out of nowhere?

20:48.330 --> 20:50.457
It's the official flower of apology.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.882
See? That's why I love you.
You know shit like that.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.760
Oh.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.179
Ugh! How come you always get
to be the caged tiger, okay?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.848
Maybe this time, I wanna be
the caged tiger. You think about that?

21:06.932 --> 21:09.434
-It's a big cage.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.353
-That's new.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.522
Do I just... do I...

21:13.605 --> 21:15.732
-You just walk.

21:15.816 --> 21:19.194
-Fuck, yeah. I think I might like it.
-You do. It's good. You first.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.612
Fucking Shaun.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.575
No, not me fucking Shaun.
Like, God, no.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.035
Shaun's pissing me off.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.038
Okay. So Shaun can
piss you off now?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.957
Which means you give a damn
about Shaun.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.583
Um, that is so stupid.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.336
Just stop saying stupid shit
and try to be less stupid.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.922
He's big and he's furry
and he wears a rotation

21:39.006 --> 21:41.216
of, like, four weird t-shirts.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.218
Okay, I get it. Shaun's not your type.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.345
So, uh, what'd he do
to piss you off?

21:45.429 --> 21:48.181
He...  he says that
my thesis isn't really about

21:48.265 --> 21:50.225
the plight of
the millennial male;

21:50.309 --> 21:51.685
that it's about me.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.061
-Yeah. Yeah.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.230
And he's, um, he says that
I'm trying to figure out

21:55.314 --> 21:57.441
what's wrong with me,
why guys keep leaving me.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.067
-No!

21:59.151 --> 22:00.652
Yeah. And...

22:00.736 --> 22:04.197
Wait. Wait are you saying <i>no,</i>
like, "No fucking shit"?

22:04.281 --> 22:05.532
Yeah, I am.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.701
Nin, there's been two guys
in 10 years.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.494
Three including today's
thesis date,

22:09.578 --> 22:12.080
-who was actually a really cool guy.
-Okay. And he, um, took off...

22:15.542 --> 22:18.295
when I called him a twat
and threw a drink in his face.  What a pussy.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.674
Right?

22:25.010 --> 22:26.887
-Oh, okay.
-I-I just-- I can't shake this feeling
that Emma's here

22:28.930 --> 22:31.266
for more than
a business meeting, you know?

22:32.559 --> 22:34.561
-I ordered pizza.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.104
-Oh. Sweet.
-Yeah.

22:36.563 --> 22:37.564
I'm starving.

22:41.109 --> 22:42.986
Um...

22:45.113 --> 22:47.365
You can't talk to me like that,

22:48.450 --> 22:50.327
especially in front of customers.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.580
Um... o-okay.

22:54.748 --> 22:57.959
So, however it's going to be
between us, it is not...

22:58.376 --> 23:00.587
it is not gonna be like that. Fine. Um, I'm sorry.

23:04.382 --> 23:05.550
And I'll work on it.

23:06.593 --> 23:07.552
Okay.

23:07.969 --> 23:09.679
Uh...

23:10.097 --> 23:12.015
-Izzy.
-Shaun.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.811
Okay. So to be continued.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.395
Yeah.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.024
Hmm.

23:30.450 --> 23:34.246
So... what have we learned here
today in the tiger cage?

23:35.038 --> 23:37.582
Shaun's got a surprisingly
impressive pair.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.837
And you need to stop
obsessing over Emma.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.506
-Yeah.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.055
Damn it.

23:53.014 --> 23:57.102
Uh, maybe we could save this look
for the second time you meet my dad?

24:02.440 --> 24:05.277
Oh, my God.
You are nervous.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.280
That is very cute.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.867
It's the first time I met
someone's dad since Hal Seaver.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.786
Yeah

24:15.203 --> 24:17.664
He gave me a pamphlet
for conversion therapy.

24:17.747 --> 24:21.877
Ha ha. Well... well,
it looked like it worked.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.461
Mm.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.507
But you have to wait
until we get home.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.967
Okay, then I'm gonna
challenge your father

24:29.050 --> 24:31.469
-to a speed-eating contest.

24:33.722 --> 24:37.309
-I love you.
-Well, duh. I'm touching on your privates.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.105
I'll get this one 'cause...

24:42.189 --> 24:43.481
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You know...

24:44.316 --> 24:46.026
Okay, I'll be picking out

24:46.109 --> 24:48.486
the perfect pair
of father-meeting undies.

24:48.945 --> 24:49.946
Mm-hmm.

25:03.668 --> 25:06.671
Oh, hey, Em. What the fuck
are you doing here?

25:06.755 --> 25:09.925
Yellow roses,
the official flower of apology.

25:10.508 --> 25:13.553
Would it help if I knelt?
Others have enjoyed it.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.598
That seems excessive.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.643
But I would move one way
or the other if I were you.

25:19.726 --> 25:20.560
Why?

25:22.312 --> 25:24.064
I dig the vase.

25:24.147 --> 25:26.066
What'd I tell you this morning, Em?

25:26.149 --> 25:29.361
I told you to stay the fuck away.
Did it seem like I was joking?

25:29.444 --> 25:31.988
Yes, would you please
just hear me out?

25:33.365 --> 25:36.451
-It was just some lost chick.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.328
A lost chick with a vase
