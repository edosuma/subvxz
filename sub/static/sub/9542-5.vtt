WEBVTT

00:07.400 --> 00:09.038
I don't like it.

00:09.073 --> 00:10.585
You oughta be wearing a wire.

00:10.620 --> 00:12.395
Oh. Listen, Leland,

00:12.430 --> 00:14.363
we don't even know what he's got.

00:14.398 --> 00:16.937
Well, look, maybe I should
hang and watch your back.

00:16.972 --> 00:18.090
Oh, come on.

00:18.125 --> 00:19.956
You worry too much. You always did.

00:19.991 --> 00:22.766
Leland, go home. Get some sleep.

00:22.801 --> 00:23.916
Past your bedtime.

00:23.951 --> 00:25.411
Look, Adam, could you do me a favor?

00:25.446 --> 00:26.069
Yeah?

00:26.104 --> 00:29.069
When we're in public,
you call me Captain, okay?

00:29.488 --> 00:32.488
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.

00:32.972 --> 00:35.972
Still can't say it without laughing.

How about a photo?

01:02.011 --> 01:03.249
Here's your ticket.

01:03.284 --> 01:04.709
You can pick it up when you leave.

01:04.744 --> 01:07.709
No thanks.

01:17.187 --> 01:18.483
John Gitomer?

01:18.518 --> 01:19.883
You Kirk?

01:21.404 --> 01:22.989
Something you wanted to tell me?

01:23.024 --> 01:25.758
No, no, no. I said I had
something to sell you.

01:25.793 --> 01:27.749
Oh. Okay. What?

01:27.784 --> 01:28.803
Shipment of purple haze,

01:28.838 --> 01:30.282
10,000 tabs.

01:30.317 --> 01:32.868
I know where, I know when, I know who.

01:32.903 --> 01:34.288
You interested?

01:34.323 --> 01:35.792
If it's righteous, I'm interested.

01:35.827 --> 01:36.743
Okay, but not here.

01:36.778 --> 01:38.078
No, this is fine.

01:38.113 --> 01:38.893
Hey, hey.

01:38.928 --> 01:40.743
Hey! Get your hands off me, man!

01:40.778 --> 01:43.743
Listen. You got a problem?

01:46.095 --> 01:46.981
I can't talk here.

01:47.016 --> 01:48.606
Why not?

01:48.641 --> 01:51.235
Up there.

01:51.270 --> 01:53.327
No. I don't think so.

01:53.362 --> 01:54.745
Who told you to call me?

01:54.780 --> 01:56.229
I'll tell you... up there.

01:56.264 --> 01:57.127
No. Who gave you my name?

01:57.162 --> 02:00.127
I'll see you up there.

02:21.174 --> 02:23.758
Hey, somebody call the cops.!

02:23.793 --> 02:26.128
Hey.! This guy's trying to kill me.!

02:26.163 --> 02:27.002
What are you yelling about?

02:27.037 --> 02:29.510
Hey.! For God's sake, stop the ride.!

02:29.545 --> 02:30.241
Hey, pal...

02:30.276 --> 02:32.024
- He's killing me.!
- Calm down.

02:32.059 --> 02:33.444
He's trying to kill me.!

02:33.479 --> 02:34.305
What are you talking about?

02:34.340 --> 02:35.976
- Help!
- Cut it out.

02:36.011 --> 02:37.654
- Help!
- Hey.! Calm down.!

02:37.689 --> 02:39.056
Somebody call the cops.!

02:39.091 --> 02:41.532
- What? I'm not...
- Hey.! He's trying to kill me.!

02:41.567 --> 02:44.532
- Stop the ride.!
- Stop the wheel. Let me off.

02:48.077 --> 02:49.230
You're a sick puppy.

02:49.265 --> 02:51.101
Police officer.! Step back.!

02:51.136 --> 02:53.566
Everything's all right.

02:53.601 --> 02:55.988
What did you do?

02:56.023 --> 02:57.979
Somebody call 911.

02:58.014 --> 03:01.673
I didn't do nothing. I was...

03:10.789 --> 03:16.806
MONK Season 1 Epi. 04
Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival

03:58.900 --> 04:00.318
Lieutenant Adam Kirk is, of course,

04:00.353 --> 04:02.058
no stranger to controversy.

04:02.093 --> 04:04.798
Six year ago he was suspended
for using excessive force...

04:04.833 --> 04:05.845
Have you been drinking?

04:05.880 --> 04:07.136
I don't know. A taste.

04:07.171 --> 04:08.980
Amphetamines, anything?

04:09.015 --> 04:10.292
They're gonna want a blood test.

04:10.327 --> 04:11.787
Bring it on.

04:11.822 --> 04:13.812
And he was in the news again recently...

04:13.847 --> 04:15.635
when alleged killer Leonard Stokes

04:15.670 --> 04:17.765
accused him of police brutality.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.765
- Captain, we got to...
- Give me 30 seconds, all right?

04:20.904 --> 04:22.525
All right.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.720
Internal Affairs is gonna
try to rip you apart.

04:24.755 --> 04:26.673
Well, they've been trying for years.

04:26.708 --> 04:28.819
Look, Adam, is there
something you wanna tell me?

04:28.854 --> 04:30.823
He pulled a knife, there was a fight,

04:30.858 --> 04:32.012
it was either you or him?

04:32.047 --> 04:33.139
Leland.

04:33.174 --> 04:35.207
Leland, I never touched him.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.823
There were bruises on his chest.

04:36.858 --> 04:39.111
Well, he must've stuck himself.

04:39.146 --> 04:42.111
He stuck himself.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.325
All right, look,

04:43.360 --> 04:45.032
from this point forward,
you don't say anything.

04:45.067 --> 04:45.567
Mm-hmm.

04:45.602 --> 04:47.242
No. You don't speak English.

04:47.277 --> 04:48.940
I'm gonna call Sam Dwyer from P. D. A.

04:48.975 --> 04:51.547
- And he'll send somebody over.
- Leo, I never touched him!

04:51.582 --> 04:53.430
Not a word.

04:53.465 --> 04:54.290
I'll talk to you later.

04:54.325 --> 04:56.988
- Captain.
- All right.

04:57.023 --> 04:58.331
Let's go.

04:58.366 --> 05:01.251
Paul?

05:01.286 --> 05:03.356
Well, he was stabbed in the aorta.

05:03.391 --> 05:05.910
He was gone before he hit the ground.

05:05.945 --> 05:07.201
Self-defense?

05:07.236 --> 05:08.066
Maybe.

05:08.101 --> 05:09.112
What about the bruises?

05:09.147 --> 05:11.097
There was a fight.
That's all I know.

05:11.132 --> 05:12.614
When I get him down to my beauty parlor,

05:12.649 --> 05:14.147
I'll know a little more.

05:14.182 --> 05:15.662
Thanks, Paul.

05:15.697 --> 05:17.115
All right. I need the lab

05:17.150 --> 05:18.947
to run the knife as soon as possible.

05:18.982 --> 05:19.632
Yes, sir.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.973
And I need Adam charged and booked.

05:22.008 --> 05:24.973
Have Parko do that.

05:25.848 --> 05:27.302
What am I supposed to do?

05:27.337 --> 05:29.601
Two guys go up alone,
one of them comes out dead.

05:29.636 --> 05:32.601
What do you want me to do?

05:33.069 --> 05:34.341
Captain, what about Monk?

05:34.376 --> 05:36.180
He might see something
that we're not seeing.

05:36.215 --> 05:37.836
Monk is no good to anybody right now.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.350
He's going before the
review board tomorrow.

05:40.385 --> 05:42.231
You know how he gets
when he's under pressure.

05:42.266 --> 05:45.169
He's gonna be a basket case tomorrow.

05:45.204 --> 05:46.727
Former Detective Monk,

05:46.762 --> 05:48.441
we've been reviewing your file,

05:48.476 --> 05:49.702
which includes a statement

05:49.737 --> 05:52.480
from your psychiatrist, Dr. Kroger.

05:52.515 --> 05:53.939
Now, he says you're still obsessed

05:53.974 --> 05:55.042
with the murder of your wife...

05:55.077 --> 05:57.781
to the point where you
are emotionally paralyzed.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.291
Do you agree?

05:59.326 --> 06:01.561
Well, she was my wife.

06:01.596 --> 06:04.213
You can understand.

06:04.248 --> 06:06.809
It's not just another case.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.099
How's that investigation going?

06:08.134 --> 06:09.124
We're stalled.

06:09.159 --> 06:10.388
Frankly, it's a dead end.

06:10.423 --> 06:12.138
However, there is some good news.

06:12.173 --> 06:15.138
Kroger says that you've been
showing some significant progress...

06:15.292 --> 06:16.767
in some of your other problems.

06:16.802 --> 06:18.991
Yes, I've been working hard.

06:19.026 --> 06:19.786
Since your suspension,

06:19.821 --> 06:22.786
you've been working as
a private investigator. Is that right?

06:27.390 --> 06:30.309
Well, it hasn't made me rich,

06:30.344 --> 06:32.264
but, you know, it's what I do.

06:33.067 --> 06:34.865
It's what you do.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.928
I like that.

06:36.963 --> 06:39.928
You feel that you're ready
to do what you do for us again?

06:41.027 --> 06:42.297
I mean, officially?

06:42.332 --> 06:44.685
I think I'm ready.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.361
As you know, I've been doing

06:46.396 --> 06:48.361
some consulting work for the department.

06:48.396 --> 06:50.364
Yes, on eight occasions.

06:50.399 --> 06:51.390
It's very impressive.

06:51.425 --> 06:52.433
Although, isn't it true, Mr. Monk,

06:52.468 --> 06:54.093
that on more than one occasion your phobias

06:54.128 --> 06:55.607
have hindered the investigation?

06:55.642 --> 06:58.369
For example, last February...

06:58.404 --> 07:02.069
your fear of heights allowed a suspect
in San Anselmo to escape.

07:02.364 --> 07:05.364
Well, no officer is
without fear of some kind.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.266
That's true.
We all accept that,

07:07.301 --> 07:10.266
as long those fears don't interfere
with the performance of his duties.

07:11.305 --> 07:14.305
We'll be making a formal recommendation
by the end of the week.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.164
We have to speak with
two or three more people,

07:17.199 --> 07:19.311
including Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.

07:19.346 --> 07:20.457
Captain Stottlemeyer.

07:20.492 --> 07:22.991
As your commanding officer for years,

07:23.026 --> 07:24.935
his testimony is crucial.

07:24.970 --> 07:27.935
Thank you for coming in.

07:31.438 --> 07:32.959
Mr. Monk?

07:32.994 --> 07:35.022
Thank you.

07:35.057 --> 07:35.827
Thank you very much.

07:35.862 --> 07:38.827
We'll reconvene tomorrow at 5:00.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.316
How'd it go?

07:44.351 --> 07:47.270
It went great!

07:47.305 --> 07:48.807
- I was amazing.
- Yes. Yes.

07:48.842 --> 07:51.074
I was Fred Astaire.

07:51.109 --> 07:53.876
Did you remember to bite the tip
of your tongue to help you focus?

07:53.911 --> 07:55.675
I bit the tip of my tongue.

07:55.710 --> 07:56.649
- I was great.
- Yes!

07:56.684 --> 07:57.991
Get in the car.

07:58.026 --> 07:58.611
What are you doing?

07:58.646 --> 08:01.163
I'm driving. Get in the car.

08:01.198 --> 08:03.348
No, you're not.

08:04.598 --> 08:06.440
Sharona, they could be
watching me right now from the...

08:06.475 --> 08:07.326
Don't look...

08:07.361 --> 08:09.193
from the window right now.

08:09.228 --> 08:10.336
Don't look.

08:10.371 --> 08:10.897
So what?

08:10.932 --> 08:12.920
So I can't let them see you driving me.

08:12.955 --> 08:14.571
I'd look like an invalid.

08:14.606 --> 08:16.686
So get in the car.

08:16.721 --> 08:18.118
No.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.834
Get in the car.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.659
Will you get in the car?

08:25.841 --> 08:27.133
Do you even know how to drive?

08:27.168 --> 08:29.888
Yes, I know how to drive.

08:31.239 --> 08:32.371
I've never seen you.

08:32.405 --> 08:34.626
There's about 15 things that I can do

08:34.662 --> 08:36.311
that you've never seen me do.

08:36.346 --> 08:37.280
Like what?

08:37.315 --> 08:39.842
Drive. I can drive.
Get in the car.

08:39.878 --> 08:41.893
- Don't...
- They're not watching!

08:41.928 --> 08:43.572
Look, what are you doing looking?

08:43.607 --> 08:45.454
What are you doing?

08:45.489 --> 08:46.663
Do you even have a license?

08:46.698 --> 08:47.739
Of course I have a license.

08:47.774 --> 08:48.846
Is it valid?

08:48.881 --> 08:49.750
You know what?

08:49.785 --> 08:51.775
I'm gonna show it to you.

08:51.810 --> 08:52.923
In the car.

08:52.958 --> 08:55.369
I just put in a new $1,200 transmission.

08:55.404 --> 08:58.003
I'm not gonna wreck your
precious transmission.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.155
Get in the car.

09:00.190 --> 09:01.444
I have an idea.

09:01.479 --> 09:02.899
Start yawning.

09:02.934 --> 09:03.659
Yawning?

09:03.694 --> 09:06.231
Yeah, to make it look like
you're too tired to drive.

09:06.266 --> 09:07.886
Why would I be too tired to drive?

09:07.921 --> 09:09.055
It's 10:00 in the morning.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.303
I'm not in kindergarten.

09:10.338 --> 09:12.061
I'm trying to get my badge back here!

09:12.096 --> 09:13.353
Everybody gets tired.

09:13.388 --> 09:15.437
You don't think cops get tired?

09:15.472 --> 09:17.582
It's too late to start yawning now.

09:17.617 --> 09:18.575
I would have had to start yawning

09:18.610 --> 09:20.412
when I was upstairs to set it up.

09:20.447 --> 09:22.629
It is not too late to
stop yawning right now,

09:22.664 --> 09:24.548
because you have to start
yawning at some point of the day.

09:24.583 --> 09:26.268
Everybody yawns all day.

09:26.303 --> 09:29.268
There's no rules. Yawn.

09:30.630 --> 09:31.737
Mr. Monk.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.584
You're still here.

09:33.619 --> 09:36.584
Yeah. Yeah, we're leaving though.

09:36.935 --> 09:38.049
We're going. Here we go.

09:38.084 --> 09:40.639
Sharona, you coming?

09:46.042 --> 09:48.350
Keys. Keys.

09:49.783 --> 09:50.718
Good parking spot,

09:50.753 --> 09:52.548
though, don't you think? I mean,

09:52.583 --> 09:54.145
lucky, lucky.

09:54.180 --> 09:56.805
Can't beat it with a stick.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.834
Okay, I got it.

10:01.409 --> 10:03.127
See you next time.

10:25.205 --> 10:26.922
What were you thinking?

10:26.957 --> 10:28.946
You said, "Turn," so I turned.

10:28.981 --> 10:30.809
No. I mean into the parking lot!

10:30.844 --> 10:33.239
Look at my headlight, Adrian!

10:33.274 --> 10:34.246
It's nothing.

10:34.281 --> 10:35.127
Nothing?

10:35.162 --> 10:36.686
It is totally smashed.

10:36.721 --> 10:38.147
Look at that!

10:45.341 --> 10:46.878
Hello?

10:48.067 --> 10:50.866
Yes, he's right here.

10:50.901 --> 10:51.869
Now?

10:53.608 --> 10:56.608
Okay, we'll be right there.

10:56.772 --> 10:59.197
Stottlemeyer. He says it's very important.

10:59.232 --> 11:01.566
No! No! Adrian!

11:02.489 --> 11:04.230
I'm driving.

11:04.265 --> 11:05.359
When hell freezes over,

11:05.394 --> 11:06.284
you can drive again.

11:06.319 --> 11:07.126
No. You know what?

11:07.161 --> 11:08.395
Even if hell freezes over,

11:08.430 --> 11:09.503
I'm still driving,

11:09.538 --> 11:11.508
because I don't want
you driving on the ice.

11:11.543 --> 11:13.284
Get in the car!

11:14.009 --> 11:15.059
Your Honor,

11:15.094 --> 11:17.476
this is not Lieutenant
Kirk's first offense.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.006
We have a case, docket 4-5-5.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.108
Adam Kirk v Leonard Stokes,

11:22.143 --> 11:25.108
in which Lieutenant Kirk is
accused of police brutality.

11:25.747 --> 11:27.457
This is obscene!

11:27.492 --> 11:29.863
Don't touch Stokes,
but you can string me up right here?

11:29.898 --> 11:32.443
Lieutenant, can you or
can you not control your temper?

11:32.478 --> 11:33.348
I can, Your Honor.

11:33.383 --> 11:36.348
Then do it... on the
street and in my courtroom.

11:36.376 --> 11:37.363
Mr. Dwyer?

11:37.398 --> 11:39.021
We request that Lieutenant Kirk

11:39.056 --> 11:41.047
be released on his own recognizance.

11:41.082 --> 11:43.434
Adam Kirk is a decorated officer,

11:43.469 --> 11:46.005
and the claims against my client
in this case and the case

11:46.040 --> 11:47.440
involving Mr. Stokes...

11:47.475 --> 11:48.970
have not been substantiated.

11:49.005 --> 11:51.647
I don't know how much more
substantiated a case can get.

11:51.682 --> 11:54.356
Bail is set at $50,000.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.683
So what do you think?

12:00.233 --> 12:01.828
They're on a Ferris wheel alone.

12:01.863 --> 12:03.233
The Ferris wheel stops. The guy's dead.

12:03.268 --> 12:04.832
I know it looks bad.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.098
"Bad" is not the word.

12:06.133 --> 12:07.220
"Guilty" is the word.

12:07.255 --> 12:09.105
Kirk has got a temper.
We're not denying that.

12:09.140 --> 12:10.412
You couldn't deny it.

12:10.447 --> 12:12.253
I've seen it firsthand.

12:12.288 --> 12:13.227
There's something not right here.

12:13.262 --> 12:15.854
He swears up and down
he did not touch the kid.

12:15.889 --> 12:17.430
Maybe he blacked out or something,

12:17.465 --> 12:18.599
you know, like you do.

12:18.634 --> 12:20.051
What do you want me to do?

12:20.086 --> 12:21.222
I want you to do your thing.

12:21.257 --> 12:22.837
I want you to do that thing you do.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.310
I've known Kirk for 20 years.

12:24.345 --> 12:25.455
He's a great cop.

12:25.490 --> 12:27.539
You used to say that about Adrian.

12:27.574 --> 12:29.197
Could we not make this a personal thing?

12:29.232 --> 12:32.013
This is not about who daddy loves more.

12:32.048 --> 12:33.162
Monk, I need this.

12:33.197 --> 12:36.162
You do right by me and
I'll owe you one, all right?

12:38.971 --> 12:41.157
I'd like to talk it over with Sharona.

12:41.192 --> 12:42.386
Sure.

12:46.121 --> 12:47.820
- What do you think?
- I think you should do it.

12:47.855 --> 12:49.078
The captain's gonna testify

12:49.113 --> 12:50.838
in front of the review board tomorrow.

12:50.873 --> 12:53.838
This may be good help.

12:54.974 --> 12:57.747
I agree, but let's stay here a minute,

12:57.782 --> 12:58.853
make it look like it's a tough decision.

12:58.888 --> 13:00.331
Okay.

13:00.366 --> 13:02.089
What should we talk about?

13:02.124 --> 13:03.300
I don't know.

13:03.335 --> 13:04.020
How's Benjy?

13:04.055 --> 13:05.230
He's good.

13:05.265 --> 13:06.371
What grade is he in now?

13:06.406 --> 13:07.604
- Fifth.
- Fifth grade.

13:07.639 --> 13:10.604
Failing math. It's driving
me crazy. Yeah, but...

13:10.782 --> 13:13.138
- Hey, Monk.
- Yeah?

13:13.173 --> 13:14.836
We can hear you.

13:22.232 --> 13:23.749
All right. Here's the deal.

13:23.784 --> 13:26.089
This has gotta be done
under the table, all right?

13:26.124 --> 13:28.381
- Off the book.
- Internal Affairs is all over it.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.526
They don't want any
outsiders poking around.

13:30.561 --> 13:33.249
Okay?

13:33.284 --> 13:35.081
Good,

13:35.116 --> 13:36.928
Thank you.

13:36.963 --> 13:38.340
It's okay.

13:44.998 --> 13:46.621
I saw that, Adrian.

13:48.767 --> 13:50.304
Look at them out there.

13:50.339 --> 13:53.304
Trying to get a picture of a killer cop.

13:53.752 --> 13:56.002
Too bad I can't charge them rent.

13:56.037 --> 13:58.065
Did you talk to them?

13:58.100 --> 14:00.298
I just told them I was a friend.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.358
Thanks for lying.

14:02.393 --> 14:05.520
You know, I don't hold
what you did against you.

14:06.305 --> 14:07.554
Why would you?

14:07.589 --> 14:08.745
I told the truth.

14:08.780 --> 14:09.677
From your point of view.

14:09.712 --> 14:11.534
I was there, Lieutenant.

14:11.569 --> 14:14.534
- I saw what you did.
- It was resisting arrest.

14:16.409 --> 14:17.943
I was there.

14:19.541 --> 14:22.541
Well, that makes your being
here now mean even more.

14:24.453 --> 14:26.843
You know what really
kills me about this is, uh,

14:26.878 --> 14:29.843
I'm supposed to testify
against Stokes next week.

14:31.652 --> 14:33.899
Best thing I ever did was getting
that butcher off the street.

14:33.934 --> 14:35.286
Now he's gonna walk.

14:35.321 --> 14:36.289
Why would he walk?

14:36.324 --> 14:38.756
He claims that I beat
a confession out of him.

14:38.791 --> 14:40.698
This makes his case.

14:42.278 --> 14:43.423
What are you doing?

14:43.458 --> 14:46.423
If you don't mind, it helps him think.

14:46.604 --> 14:48.688
Oh. Knock yourself out.

14:48.723 --> 14:51.673
Wanna tell me what happened
on the Ferris wheel?

14:51.708 --> 14:53.186
Yeah, that was stupid.

14:53.221 --> 14:54.966
I get a call from this punk, Gitomer.

14:55.001 --> 14:56.074
You knew him?

14:56.109 --> 14:57.304
No. I never met him.

14:57.339 --> 14:58.658
I check him out.

14:58.693 --> 14:59.874
He's got some punk stuff...

14:59.909 --> 15:02.182
possession, stolen vehicle.

15:02.217 --> 15:04.797
So he wants to meet at the carnival...

15:04.832 --> 15:07.797
busy place, lot of people.

15:07.856 --> 15:09.556
Meet about what?

15:09.591 --> 15:12.556
He's got something on a
shipment of purple haze.

15:14.384 --> 15:16.203
So we meet,

15:16.238 --> 15:17.614
he starts hemming and hawing,

15:17.649 --> 15:18.954
and then he says that he'll talk,

15:18.989 --> 15:21.385
but only on the Ferris wheel.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.596
The Ferris wheel's his idea?

15:22.631 --> 15:24.030
Oh, yeah. His idea.

15:24.065 --> 15:25.302
So we get on.

15:25.337 --> 15:27.463
I don't get out word one, he goes postal.

15:27.498 --> 15:29.404
You didn't do anything?

15:29.439 --> 15:30.658
Hand to God.

15:30.693 --> 15:32.479
He starts throwing himself around.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.023
He's screaming, "Help!
Help! He's gonna kill me!"

15:35.058 --> 15:36.560
So the operator shuts down the rig.

15:36.595 --> 15:37.236
I get off.

15:37.271 --> 15:38.899
I walk 10 feet, I hear screaming.

15:38.934 --> 15:40.919
I turn around and there's
Gitomer on the deck

15:40.954 --> 15:43.027
with a knife in his chest.

15:43.062 --> 15:44.133
Whose knife was it?

15:44.168 --> 15:46.250
Not a clue.

15:46.285 --> 15:49.250
And you didn't touch this guy?

15:50.141 --> 15:51.193
No, I didn't touch him.

15:51.228 --> 15:53.176
Maybe he shoved you,
you shoved him back.

15:53.211 --> 15:54.678
No, I didn't touch the guy.

15:54.713 --> 15:56.347
Things got out ofhand. It happens.

15:56.382 --> 15:58.460
No, it doesn't happen!

15:59.791 --> 16:01.977
Not to me.

16:05.161 --> 16:07.491
Not anymore.

16:15.624 --> 16:16.532
How's Anita?

16:16.567 --> 16:19.355
Oh, she's good. Thanks for asking.

16:19.390 --> 16:20.362
Where is she?

16:20.397 --> 16:21.702
You just missed her.

16:21.737 --> 16:23.441
She's just out shopping.

16:23.476 --> 16:26.173
She should be back, oh, any minute now.

16:26.208 --> 16:29.173
Listen, friend, if I'm gonna help you out,

16:29.208 --> 16:32.208
y-you can't lie to me.

16:33.389 --> 16:34.822
- What?
- You two had a fight.

16:34.857 --> 16:36.907
She moved out.

16:39.949 --> 16:42.197
Now, who told you that?

16:42.232 --> 16:44.955
The woman is obviously into gardening,

16:44.990 --> 16:47.955
but every plant in the place is dying.

16:51.335 --> 16:53.647
Well,

16:53.682 --> 16:56.385
she always comes back.

17:02.073 --> 17:03.506
I'm done here.

17:04.513 --> 17:07.513
You're gonna make
somebody a wonderful wife.

17:08.575 --> 17:11.575
I can't make any promises.

17:12.711 --> 17:14.309
Understood.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.768
Okay, remember,
we're not officially on the case,

17:23.803 --> 17:24.736
so be cool.

17:24.771 --> 17:26.170
Yeah. I'll be as cool as you.

17:26.204 --> 17:27.624
Mom, how many tickets can we get?

17:27.659 --> 17:29.158
I don't know.

17:29.193 --> 17:31.503
Okay, let's get a whole sheet,
which is $40.

17:31.538 --> 17:32.938
I don't know, Benjy.

17:32.973 --> 17:34.433
I work for a very cheap man.

17:34.468 --> 17:35.427
- How many?
- Ten?

17:35.462 --> 17:37.206
That's true. She does.

17:37.241 --> 17:38.987
He's also a very naive man...

17:39.022 --> 17:41.987
who doesn't know when he's being used.

17:42.666 --> 17:44.057
Hmm? What?

17:44.092 --> 17:45.023
Who's being used?

17:45.058 --> 17:45.763
You are.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.132
Kirk's no good and you know it.

17:48.167 --> 17:49.772
He's Stottlemeyer's ex-partner.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.794
The captain will do
anything to save his ass.

17:51.829 --> 17:54.223
He just wants you to come up
with one of your convoluted theories

17:54.258 --> 17:57.223
so he can parade you in front of a jury.

17:58.143 --> 18:00.614
Are you listening to me?

18:00.649 --> 18:02.110
What's wrong?

18:02.145 --> 18:03.972
The Ferris wheel... it's kind of big.

18:04.007 --> 18:05.690
I can't go on it.

18:05.725 --> 18:08.690
Well, you have to.
It's a crime scene.

18:08.727 --> 18:10.985
- Nah. Nah.
- Benjy, the bumper cars are over there.

18:11.020 --> 18:11.975
Uh-uh.

18:12.010 --> 18:13.440
Come on.! Please.!

18:13.475 --> 18:16.440
We gotta find Stottlemeyer.

18:24.836 --> 18:27.117
Hey.

18:27.152 --> 18:29.460
Hey. You remember Benjy.

18:29.495 --> 18:31.847
Yes. How you doing, Benjy?

18:31.882 --> 18:34.120
You're in Little League, right?

18:34.155 --> 18:35.582
Yeah. I think my kid beaned you last year.

18:35.617 --> 18:38.509
Hey, folks.!
How about a photo?

18:38.544 --> 18:41.509
- No, thank you.
- Come on. It's a souvenir.

18:41.697 --> 18:44.697
It's a carnival.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.920
One big happy family.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.774
- Thank you very much.
- Here's your ticket.

18:50.809 --> 18:52.591
- You can pick it up on your way out.
- Thank you.

18:52.626 --> 18:53.483
Let's go.

18:54.712 --> 18:56.769
Monk?

18:56.804 --> 18:57.999
Adrian?

18:58.034 --> 19:00.041
Monk, come on.

19:00.076 --> 19:00.826
Here you go.

19:00.861 --> 19:02.648
Unclaimed from the day
you were asking about.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.475
This is everything.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.259
Adrian, I promised Benjy
I'd take him on the bumper cars,

19:07.294 --> 19:08.565
so we'll meet you later, okay?

19:08.600 --> 19:10.043
Just stay close to the captain.

19:10.078 --> 19:12.233
And if you get lost, find a policeman.

19:12.268 --> 19:14.739
- Promise?
- Bingo.

19:14.774 --> 19:16.337
Look at the sweatshirt.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.669
I was thinking the same thing.

19:17.704 --> 19:18.717
Zipped all the way up.

19:18.752 --> 19:21.717
- But it must've been 95
degrees that night. - Yeah

19:26.948 --> 19:28.241
So they meet over there,

19:28.276 --> 19:29.859
walk through here, get on the ride,

19:29.894 --> 19:32.859
go round and round,
it stops and the kid's dead.

19:34.044 --> 19:35.358
Did you question the other riders?

19:35.393 --> 19:37.226
Oh, yeah.
I grilled everybody in the park.

19:37.261 --> 19:40.226
I got a list of...

19:41.981 --> 19:44.981
Internal Affairs.

19:45.044 --> 19:47.159
- Hey!
- Look, you just happen to be here, okay?

19:47.194 --> 19:49.289
It's your day off, understood?

19:49.324 --> 19:50.948
- Hey, Walt!
- Captain.

19:50.983 --> 19:51.708
How are you?

19:51.743 --> 19:53.529
Mr. Monk, Walter Cauffel.

19:53.564 --> 19:54.881
How's it going?

19:54.916 --> 19:56.131
Ah, it's a bitch, bitch and a half.

19:56.166 --> 19:57.283
What are you doing here?

19:57.318 --> 20:00.283
I'm here with my assistant and her kid.

20:00.694 --> 20:02.416
I never figured you
the amusement park type.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.069
Oh, sure. I love it.

20:04.104 --> 20:07.069
It's so, you know, edgy.

20:07.825 --> 20:09.382
Heard you're up for reinstatement.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.551
Good luck.

20:10.586 --> 20:11.984
Thank you. I really should be going.

20:12.019 --> 20:14.924
Have you seen Sharona?

20:14.959 --> 20:17.155
Yeah. Sharona's right over here.

20:17.190 --> 20:18.508
See you.

20:21.530 --> 20:23.576
Now, give me a couple minutes
and I'll get rid of him, all right?

20:23.611 --> 20:24.540
What should I do?

20:24.575 --> 20:26.116
Just have fun.

20:26.151 --> 20:28.126
- Fun?
- Yeah.

20:28.161 --> 20:29.539
Look, you've seen other people have fun.

20:29.574 --> 20:31.502
Imitate them.

21:01.864 --> 21:04.377
I am so hungry.

21:04.412 --> 21:06.484
Well, get a hot dog.

21:06.519 --> 21:07.896
No. No, thanks. No.

21:07.931 --> 21:10.553
Mom, can I have two dollars?

21:10.588 --> 21:11.482
Wait. What for?

21:11.517 --> 21:12.366
It's a contest.

21:12.401 --> 21:13.694
There's a big jar of jelly beans,

21:13.729 --> 21:15.230
and if I guess how many are in the jar,

21:15.265 --> 21:16.463
I win a boom box.

21:16.498 --> 21:18.346
8,385.

21:18.381 --> 21:20.330
What?

21:20.365 --> 21:21.784
That's how many jelly beans are in the jar.

21:21.819 --> 21:24.668
8,385.

21:24.703 --> 21:27.668
8,385. 8,385.

21:27.889 --> 21:29.839
Have you seen the jar?

21:29.874 --> 21:32.839
How can you guess if
you haven't seen the jar?

21:33.184 --> 21:36.058
Benjy, 8,385.

21:36.093 --> 21:39.058
Okay. Thanks, Mom.

21:39.224 --> 21:41.860
Okay. Now you owe me two dollars.

21:41.895 --> 21:44.028
There's I. A. Don't look.

21:44.063 --> 21:46.867
Come on. We gotta look
like we're blending in.

21:46.902 --> 21:48.318
Let's go.

21:49.753 --> 21:52.021
Yeah. We'll blend.

21:56.390 --> 21:57.925
Thank you.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.972
No problem.

22:00.007 --> 22:02.799
Just take it. Come on.

22:02.834 --> 22:04.684
It's good.

22:10.526 --> 22:12.799
- Whoops!
- Ow!

22:14.096 --> 22:15.161
You having fun?

22:15.196 --> 22:16.516
I think so.

22:16.551 --> 22:18.074
My head stopped throbbing,

22:18.109 --> 22:21.074
but too many clowns.
Just way too many.

22:22.326 --> 22:23.385
Come on. Relax.

22:23.420 --> 22:25.370
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

22:25.405 --> 22:27.152
Where did you get that?
I won it!

22:27.187 --> 22:28.987
It was that jelly-bean contest.

22:29.022 --> 22:30.278
Mr. Monk was right.

22:30.313 --> 22:33.278
You were only off by eight.

22:33.316 --> 22:34.649
Adrian, how'd you do that?

22:34.684 --> 22:36.223
Lucky guess.

22:36.258 --> 22:37.275
No, I'm serious.

22:37.310 --> 22:39.638
How'd you do it?

22:39.673 --> 22:41.974
Adrian.

22:42.009 --> 22:44.835
Adrian, I'm talking to you.

22:44.870 --> 22:46.269
Come on, come on.

22:46.304 --> 22:47.334
We got about an hour.

22:47.369 --> 22:49.632
I sent them to that
stripper bar on Baker Avenue.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.345
I told them Kirk hangs out there.

22:51.380 --> 22:52.293
Hello, Kitty!

22:52.328 --> 22:54.012
Aw, hell. I thought you guys were gone.

22:54.047 --> 22:55.222
I'm trying to make a living here.

22:55.257 --> 22:57.105
I'm sorry. This will only take a minute.

22:57.140 --> 22:58.397
Adrian Monk, Kitty Malone.

22:58.432 --> 23:00.665
She's been working the
Ferris wheel for seven years.

23:00.700 --> 23:01.793
Never had a problem,

23:01.828 --> 23:03.657
never had an accident till last night.

23:03.692 --> 23:05.296
I suppose he wants to hear the story too.

23:05.331 --> 23:07.034
Yes, please, if you don't mind.

23:07.069 --> 23:08.673
The freakiest thing I ever seen.

23:08.708 --> 23:10.181
Two guys got on.
A few second later,

23:10.216 --> 23:11.412
one of them starts screaming.

23:11.447 --> 23:13.702
You mean, Mr. Gitomer?

23:13.737 --> 23:14.789
I don't know names.

23:14.824 --> 23:16.204
The soon-to-be-dead one.

23:16.239 --> 23:18.049
He's screaming,
"Help! He's trying to kill me!"

23:18.084 --> 23:20.217
I looked up. Basket four
is rocking back and forth.

23:20.252 --> 23:23.217
I figure they're either
fighting or falling in love.

23:24.285 --> 23:27.124
You... You couldn't see what was happening?

23:27.159 --> 23:29.696
Nah. You can't really see
what's going on up there.

23:29.731 --> 23:30.724
So I stopped the ride. You know,

23:30.759 --> 23:33.724
I always stop for crying babies and guys
knifing each other.

23:34.414 --> 23:37.140
Any way, I pop the bar,
the cop gets out. He's pissed.

23:37.175 --> 23:39.491
He's screaming,
"I didn't do nothin'!"

23:39.526 --> 23:40.824
Where was he?

23:40.859 --> 23:42.340
Over there.

23:42.375 --> 23:43.876
And the other guy?

23:43.911 --> 23:45.411
Doubled over in his seat.

23:45.446 --> 23:46.628
He's got a knife in his chest.

23:46.663 --> 23:49.628
Then he falls over right there.

23:51.330 --> 23:54.330
Come on.! Let's go.!

23:54.412 --> 23:56.091
Get it moving.!

23:56.126 --> 23:58.304
Two more minutes,
then I gotta start charging you guys.

23:58.339 --> 23:59.384
Okay, but could you just...

23:59.419 --> 24:01.357
- Could you take your hand off it.
- It's not gonna move.

24:01.392 --> 24:03.445
- She's got her hand by the...
- It's not gonna move.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.424
She's right by the control.
It's okay.

24:05.459 --> 24:07.387
Hurry up.!

24:07.422 --> 24:09.330
Thanks, Kitty.

24:09.365 --> 24:10.846
Thank you.

24:10.881 --> 24:12.574
- Come on.!
- Let's go.!

24:12.609 --> 24:15.525
- Hello.
- What?

24:23.312 --> 24:24.952
What is that?

24:24.987 --> 24:27.952
A tarot card... or half of one.

24:27.973 --> 24:29.918
Well, anybody could've left that.

24:29.953 --> 24:31.817
I think I need to see Gitomer's place.

24:31.852 --> 24:34.817
What's it mean, half a tarot card?

24:35.064 --> 24:36.762
I don't know.

24:39.765 --> 24:40.914
It's a tarot card.

24:40.949 --> 24:42.163
Look, Mr. Crenshaw,

24:42.198 --> 24:43.395
does it mean anything to you?

24:43.430 --> 24:45.177
Yeah. It means you're wasting my time.

24:45.212 --> 24:47.648
Mr. Gitomer used tarot cards?

24:47.683 --> 24:49.101
I don't see what anybody does.

24:49.136 --> 24:50.518
I'm only the landlord.

24:50.553 --> 24:52.316
The peepholes on the
door face the wrong way,

24:52.351 --> 24:54.381
that's what I always say.

24:54.416 --> 24:56.085
How long did he live here?

24:56.120 --> 24:57.980
Oh, nine weeks, but he paid for 10,

24:58.015 --> 25:00.980
so I guess someone has a refund coming.

25:03.343 --> 25:04.535
What's this?

25:04.570 --> 25:05.473
Mister, you wouldn't believe

25:05.508 --> 25:07.700
what I've seen hanging from those fans.

25:07.735 --> 25:09.093
Adrian.

25:13.216 --> 25:14.774
This is weird.

25:14.809 --> 25:16.674
He keeps his batteries in his socks?

25:16.709 --> 25:17.884
Oh, my God.

25:17.919 --> 25:18.628
What is it?

25:18.663 --> 25:20.020
It's a weapon.

25:20.055 --> 25:23.020
They use them in prison.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.905
It's torn here.

25:37.769 --> 25:40.118
Could you...

25:41.389 --> 25:43.108
Hook it?

25:46.543 --> 25:48.749
Stand back.

25:56.373 --> 25:57.562
What the hell is that?

25:57.597 --> 26:00.383
I think he hit himself with it.

26:00.418 --> 26:01.632
All he had to do was ask.

26:01.667 --> 26:03.820
I would've been happy to
beat the crap outta the kid.

26:03.855 --> 26:05.088
I knew he was trouble.

26:05.123 --> 26:06.138
Never paid the phone bill,

26:06.173 --> 26:08.652
but always had money to go dancing.

26:08.687 --> 26:09.780
He went dancing?

26:09.815 --> 26:12.619
Yeah. Every night.
That club over in the park there...

26:12.654 --> 26:15.090
the Luna Lounge.

26:21.116 --> 26:22.571
Up!

26:24.474 --> 26:26.376
We're not open yet!

26:27.464 --> 26:30.464
Is this your claim check?

26:30.657 --> 26:33.657
Actually, I got something
I can show you in the back.

26:38.821 --> 26:40.632
Here it is.
It's been here for awhile.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.861
How long would you say it's been here?

26:42.896 --> 26:45.861
- I can't hear you!
- I need to know how...

26:50.105 --> 26:51.840
Thank you.

26:52.826 --> 26:55.035
Captain Stottlemeyer,

26:55.070 --> 26:58.035
you have used former
Detective Monk several times...

26:58.192 --> 27:00.216
over the last two and a half years.

27:00.251 --> 27:02.878
Yeah, that's right.
On a consulting basis.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.451
Have you been satisfied with his work?

27:04.486 --> 27:06.150
Yes, absolutely.

27:06.185 --> 27:09.150
He, um... He has helped me solve five...

27:09.766 --> 27:11.948
no, six very difficult cases.

27:11.983 --> 27:14.257
He has a unique way of looking at evidence

27:14.292 --> 27:15.736
even after a scene is cold.

27:15.771 --> 27:16.794
In your professional opinion,

27:16.829 --> 27:19.516
do you think Adrian Monk
is ready to be reinstated?

27:19.551 --> 27:22.006
He is an excellent investigator.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.413
I believe we've established that.

27:23.448 --> 27:24.981
The question is

27:25.016 --> 27:26.740
do you believe he should be reinstated to

27:26.775 --> 27:28.460
the San Francisco Police Department?

27:28.495 --> 27:31.460
He is reliable. He, uh,

27:31.539 --> 27:34.713
has an encyclopedic knowledge
of the strangest, most arcane things.

27:37.310 --> 27:38.520
Like book binding.

27:38.555 --> 27:40.019
- There was a case before he got...
- Captain,

27:40.054 --> 27:42.126
this is a "yes or no" question.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.622
Now, in your opinion,

27:43.657 --> 27:46.622
is he or is he not ready to be reinstated?

27:47.967 --> 27:50.457
Yes or no?

27:55.200 --> 27:57.835
The people are asking for
a continuance, Your Honor.

27:57.870 --> 27:59.799
Of course they wanna postpone.

27:59.834 --> 28:01.782
Lieutenant Kirk wasn't
one of their witnesses,

28:01.817 --> 28:03.379
he was their only witness.

28:03.414 --> 28:04.877
Now he's accused of murder.

28:04.912 --> 28:06.484
Your Honor, my client Leonard Stokes

28:06.519 --> 28:09.484
has been in jail for 14 months
based solely on his testimony.

28:10.532 --> 28:13.273
Mr. Zweibel,
are you presenting Adam Kirk or not?

28:13.308 --> 28:15.315
We can no longer vouch for Lieutenant Kirk.

28:15.350 --> 28:16.666
Then you leave me no choice.

28:16.701 --> 28:18.210
Without your witness, the statements that

28:18.245 --> 28:21.210
Mr. Stokes made in the back of
that squad car are inadmissible.

28:22.081 --> 28:24.064
Mr. Stokes.

28:25.478 --> 28:27.464
I'm dismissing this indictment.

28:27.499 --> 28:28.428
So I'm free to go?

28:28.463 --> 28:31.428
I'm sorry to say that's true. Bailiff.

28:33.018 --> 28:36.018
I need the yellow copy.

28:36.899 --> 28:39.899
Are you gonna tell me how
you did thejelly beans?

28:40.671 --> 28:43.127
- You know you're gonna tell me, Adrian.
- Stokes, Leonard.

28:43.162 --> 28:44.153
I need the yellow copy.

28:44.188 --> 28:45.507
Wait here.

28:45.542 --> 28:47.347
Excuse me. Leonard Stokes?

28:47.382 --> 28:48.639
Can I talk to you?

28:48.674 --> 28:49.829
It's a free country...

28:49.864 --> 28:51.362
at least it will be in about 10 minutes.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.080
My name is Adrian Monk.

28:53.115 --> 28:55.599
I'm investigating the
death of John Gitomer.

28:55.634 --> 28:58.599
- Did you know him?
- No.

28:58.954 --> 29:01.548
This is his cell phone.

29:01.583 --> 29:03.388
We found it in his knapsack.

29:03.423 --> 29:05.840
Mr. Gitomer received two
calls from this facility...

29:05.875 --> 29:08.840
from the phone bank in your wing
on the day he was killed.

29:09.412 --> 29:10.682
So what?

29:10.717 --> 29:11.902
You were calling him.

29:11.937 --> 29:13.762
I checked the records.

29:13.797 --> 29:15.402
They log in every outgoing call.

29:15.437 --> 29:16.853
Sign here.

29:19.408 --> 29:20.495
That's a nice watch.

29:20.530 --> 29:21.826
Yeah. Gitomer. I remember.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.432
He was here.

29:23.467 --> 29:24.842
I knew his name. That's all.

29:24.877 --> 29:26.418
Why were you calling him?

29:26.453 --> 29:27.831
I don't recall.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.205
What difference does it make?

29:29.240 --> 29:30.658
It's just interesting.

29:30.693 --> 29:31.707
You two knew each other...

29:31.742 --> 29:34.707
and his murder is the
basis for your appeal.

29:35.871 --> 29:36.674
What's that?

29:36.709 --> 29:38.313
It's from my Straight and Sober group.

29:38.348 --> 29:39.846
Three-year pin.

29:39.881 --> 29:41.446
Very nice. Congratulations.

29:41.481 --> 29:43.772
Look, I know where this is going.

29:43.807 --> 29:46.040
You're working to clear
your pal Lieutenant Kirk.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.067
No, no, no.

29:47.102 --> 29:48.256
I'm not on the force.

29:48.291 --> 29:50.106
Oh, come on. Sure you are.
I can smell it.

29:50.141 --> 29:51.402
Just looking for the truth.

29:51.437 --> 29:52.668
Lieutenant Kirk is a killer cop.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.287
That's the truth.

29:54.322 --> 29:56.675
Just not the truth you want.

29:56.710 --> 29:58.743
You could be right.

29:58.778 --> 30:00.784
Is there someplace that I can reach you?

30:00.819 --> 30:03.784
No. See you around.

30:07.002 --> 30:09.658
Gee, he's a charmer.

30:09.693 --> 30:12.131
Oh, my God!
Is that the right time?

30:12.166 --> 30:15.131
- Stottlemeyer's testifying!
- Oh, my God.

30:32.941 --> 30:34.395
You look great.

30:34.430 --> 30:37.395
I haven't worn it since Trudy's funeral.

30:37.598 --> 30:39.583
You sure you're not getting your hopes up?

30:39.618 --> 30:42.442
Of course I am.
That's what hopes are for.

30:42.477 --> 30:45.169
I was gonna smooth it out,
but it's...

30:45.204 --> 30:48.104
I know, I know.

30:55.503 --> 30:57.493
Oh, no.

31:00.271 --> 31:01.948
Oh, no.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.665
You didn't recommend me.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.465
- Look, Monk...
- You son of a bitch.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.319
I thought you were
gonna do the right thing?

31:12.354 --> 31:13.881
I think I did do the right thing.

31:13.916 --> 31:16.332
He saves your ass all the time

31:16.519 --> 31:19.376
and he never asks for anything in return.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.746
He closes case after case,

31:21.781 --> 31:23.339
and then he goes home and watches

31:23.374 --> 31:26.075
you on the news taking all the credit.

31:26.110 --> 31:27.346
I wanted to recommend you,

31:27.381 --> 31:28.577
I tried to recommend you,

31:28.612 --> 31:29.643
but I just couldn't do it.

31:29.678 --> 31:32.643
Adrian, you are not ready to carry a gun.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.289
You're not ready to have other cops

31:34.324 --> 31:36.964
depend on you under fire.

31:36.999 --> 31:39.964
In your heart,
you know you're not ready.

31:45.325 --> 31:48.325
At least your friend Adam Kirk has
the decency to stab people in the front.

32:00.149 --> 32:02.539
You okay?

32:04.259 --> 32:07.259
I just wanna be alone.

32:09.499 --> 32:12.499
Okay. I'll come with you.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.068
Hey.

32:21.144 --> 32:24.144
Uh, how did it go this afternoon, sir?

32:25.634 --> 32:27.801
It was rough.

32:27.836 --> 32:29.989
Well, I'm sure that you
did everything you could.

32:30.024 --> 32:32.913
You, uh, wanna go grab a drink?

32:32.948 --> 32:34.280
No. I'm good.

32:34.315 --> 32:37.022
Hey, Randy.

32:37.057 --> 32:40.022
Did I ever tell you about
Monk's first day as a detective?

32:41.935 --> 32:43.718
No, sir.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.520
Have a seat.

32:51.103 --> 32:54.103
He didn't have a partner,
so I got stuck with him.

32:54.645 --> 32:56.201
Was he... you know.

32:56.236 --> 32:58.992
No. He was a little wound.

33:00.001 --> 33:01.698
He used to wipe off the windshield

33:01.733 --> 33:04.697
and rearrange the glove box
before we'd roll.

33:04.732 --> 33:07.697
Anyway, we're the primaries on a body

33:07.750 --> 33:09.834
in a hotel in the Castro.

33:09.869 --> 33:12.186
A hooker had swallowed
a bunch of promazine...

33:12.221 --> 33:13.434
you know,
the big sleeping pills?

33:13.469 --> 33:15.026
Horse tranquilizer, sir.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.470
I said, "Suicide."

33:16.505 --> 33:18.424
Every cop on the scene said, "Suicide."

33:18.459 --> 33:20.186
Medical examiner said, "Suicide."

33:20.221 --> 33:22.923
Monk walks in, says, "Murder.

33:22.958 --> 33:24.683
Where's the water?"

33:24.718 --> 33:27.417
The room had no water.

33:27.452 --> 33:29.868
Simple. Eight people in the room,

33:29.903 --> 33:31.505
but nobody saw that.

33:31.540 --> 33:33.836
Well, I'm sure you would've
seen it eventually, sir.

33:33.871 --> 33:34.843
Don't kid yourself.

33:34.878 --> 33:38.980
There is only one Adrian Monk.

33:53.508 --> 33:55.529
You're gonna wear out the carpet.

33:55.564 --> 33:58.513
Have you seen the downstairs?

33:58.548 --> 34:01.513
He cleaned the whole basement.

34:02.857 --> 34:04.125
Damn!

34:05.092 --> 34:07.930
Damn it! Damn! Damn it!

34:07.965 --> 34:08.891
Damn!

34:08.926 --> 34:10.467
What happened?

34:10.503 --> 34:12.795
Aw. I knew it!
Damn. I knew it.

34:12.831 --> 34:14.963
I knew this was gonna happen.

34:14.998 --> 34:16.498
Ohh. Why me?

34:16.533 --> 34:18.583
Every single damn time.

34:18.619 --> 34:21.583
Adrian, what happened?

34:21.637 --> 34:24.088
I solved the case.

34:33.800 --> 34:34.860
Captain?

34:34.895 --> 34:35.654
Yeah?

34:35.688 --> 34:37.556
Here's your sandwich.

34:37.591 --> 34:38.438
Thank you.

34:38.474 --> 34:40.971
Ham and cheese on rye and your soda.

34:41.856 --> 34:43.429
Goody goody.

34:43.744 --> 34:46.744
Want your pickle?

34:46.887 --> 34:48.583
Not anymore.

34:48.618 --> 34:49.873
Oh.

34:50.527 --> 34:53.527
Oh, Sharona Fleming is on line two.

34:54.829 --> 34:56.502
Uh, tell her I'll call her back.

34:56.536 --> 34:59.502
Well, she says it's important.

35:04.809 --> 35:05.748
- Hi, Sharona.
- Captain,

35:05.783 --> 35:07.761
Adrian knows what happened
on the Ferris wheel.

35:07.796 --> 35:09.842
Do you want to meet us at the carnival?

35:09.877 --> 35:11.053
Let me talk to him.

35:11.088 --> 35:13.273
He wants to talk to you.

35:13.308 --> 35:15.648
Ohh. He's shaking his head "no."

35:15.683 --> 35:16.813
Was it Kirk?

35:16.848 --> 35:17.730
Was it Lieutenant Kirk?

35:17.765 --> 35:20.040
- No.
- No.

35:20.740 --> 35:21.968
This is crazy, Sharona.

35:22.003 --> 35:24.481
Put him on the phone.

35:24.516 --> 35:26.200
Adrian, he really wants to talk to you.

35:26.235 --> 35:29.200
I'm not talking to him.

35:29.241 --> 35:32.241
If you wanna hold the phone up, fine.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.097
Hold on.

35:36.132 --> 35:37.009
It was Leonard Stokes.

35:37.044 --> 35:38.685
He planned the whole thing from prison.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.030
His trial was coming up

35:40.065 --> 35:43.030
and somehow he had to get
his confession thrown out.

35:43.069 --> 35:44.220
The only chance he had

35:44.255 --> 35:45.863
was to discredit the cop that arrested him,

35:45.898 --> 35:48.863
and that was Adam Kirk.

35:48.892 --> 35:51.339
Stokes called his pal, John Gitomer.

35:51.374 --> 35:52.738
He convinced Gitomer

35:52.773 --> 35:54.929
to lure Kirk onto the Ferris wheel...

35:54.964 --> 35:57.848
and then make it look
like Kirk beat him up.

35:57.883 --> 36:00.687
The bruises on Gitomer's
chest were self-inflicted.

36:00.722 --> 36:03.687
That's why his sweatshirt
was zipped up all the way.

36:05.435 --> 36:06.808
Okay, what about the stabbing?

36:06.843 --> 36:08.188
Captain says, "What about the stabbing?"

36:08.223 --> 36:09.934
I'm getting to that, aren't I?

36:09.969 --> 36:11.628
Turn it back.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.734
It turns out, Gitomer
only knew half the plan.

36:14.769 --> 36:16.570
He was the real patsy.

36:16.605 --> 36:18.676
Stokes had another partner,

36:18.711 --> 36:20.026
someone who worked at the carnival.

36:20.061 --> 36:21.662
Someone who loved him.

36:21.697 --> 36:23.462
Someone who would kill for him.

36:23.497 --> 36:25.156
The Ferris wheel operator?

36:25.191 --> 36:27.809
Wait. How does he know it
was the Ferris wheel operator?

36:27.844 --> 36:30.809
They were both wearing
Straight and Sober buttons...

36:31.013 --> 36:32.079
orange ones.

36:32.114 --> 36:34.551
Every chapter has their own color.

36:34.586 --> 36:36.572
Took me a while to put it together.

36:36.607 --> 36:38.092
Stokes didn't want to make Lieutenant Kirk

36:38.127 --> 36:40.644
look corrupt or hot-tempered.

36:40.679 --> 36:43.644
He wanted to make Kirk look like a killer.

36:44.335 --> 36:47.335
Kitty was there to finish the job.

36:57.770 --> 36:58.426
They've been here all week.

36:58.461 --> 37:00.733
I've been questioned, like, seven times.

37:00.768 --> 37:03.733
Shh. Kitty, baby, I got a plan.

37:04.945 --> 37:06.500
Yeah. Yeah, we're here.

37:06.535 --> 37:07.689
We're by the Spider.

37:07.724 --> 37:09.546
Don't do anything,
don't go anywhere.

37:09.581 --> 37:11.101
We're on our way.

37:11.136 --> 37:13.220
Okay. Okay,
they're on their way.

37:13.255 --> 37:15.103
They're on their way.

37:20.222 --> 37:23.149
Something's wrong.

37:23.184 --> 37:24.785
Call an ambulance.!

37:27.489 --> 37:29.411
Who is it?

37:30.356 --> 37:32.069
Excuse me.

37:35.763 --> 37:39.394
- Oh, my God.
- I don't know. I heard her scream.

37:39.619 --> 37:40.928
He's still somewhere in the park.

37:40.963 --> 37:42.544
There's no way he can get out of here now.

37:42.579 --> 37:45.544
We should go up on the Ferris wheel
so we can see everything.

37:46.948 --> 37:48.258
I got a better idea.

37:48.293 --> 37:49.912
You go on the Ferris wheel.

37:49.947 --> 37:52.912
You can see everything.

37:53.278 --> 37:54.854
Do you know how to work it?

37:54.889 --> 37:57.854
How hard can it be?

38:10.253 --> 38:13.253
Adrian, stop! It's perfect!

38:19.598 --> 38:21.051
Looking for me?

38:21.086 --> 38:22.506
Well, here I am.
You better hang on.

38:22.541 --> 38:23.878
- Adrian!
- This ride's gonna get pretty wild.

38:23.913 --> 38:24.579
Oh, God.

38:24.614 --> 38:26.458
Adrian! Adrian, he's up here!

38:26.493 --> 38:27.708
Get me down now!

38:27.743 --> 38:28.777
What?

38:28.812 --> 38:31.033
Stokes is up here!

38:31.068 --> 38:33.319
Get me down.! Now.!

38:36.341 --> 38:39.156
The man's getting up.!
Whoa.! What's he doing?

38:39.191 --> 38:41.719
Adrian, get me down!
Please hurry!

38:41.754 --> 38:44.920
- Hurry up.!
- I'm trying.!

38:44.955 --> 38:45.620
Look out.!

38:45.655 --> 38:47.483
What a stupid place to hide.

38:47.518 --> 38:49.748
No wonder this guy spent
halfhis life in prison.

38:49.783 --> 38:51.162
You just told me down there

38:51.197 --> 38:52.781
that you knew how to do this!

38:52.816 --> 38:55.781
Look, I am not familiar
with this particular model!

38:56.634 --> 38:59.634
Do something and do it fast.!

39:02.710 --> 39:03.888
Oh, my God.

39:03.923 --> 39:05.311
Damn it, he's gonna get me!

39:05.346 --> 39:07.146
- It's not working!
- Hurry up!

39:07.181 --> 39:10.146
Will you stop thinking and do something?

39:14.018 --> 39:18.994
Adrian.! He's got a knife.!

39:25.728 --> 39:29.317
- Ohh. Oh, my God.
- Adrian.!

39:32.745 --> 39:34.097
Adrian!

39:34.132 --> 39:35.978
Help!

39:37.451 --> 39:38.904
What am I doing?

39:38.939 --> 39:40.419
What am I doing?

39:40.454 --> 39:41.790
You're saving me!

39:41.825 --> 39:44.790
Police.! Turn off the damn Ferris wheel.

39:52.189 --> 39:54.799
Give it up, Stokes.!

40:09.666 --> 40:11.243
I've been looking forward to this.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.900
I'm sure you have too.

40:13.935 --> 40:15.106
Your badge and your gun.

40:15.141 --> 40:16.478
They don't belong in my desk.

40:16.513 --> 40:18.290
They belong with you on the street

40:18.325 --> 40:21.290
where you can do yourjob.

40:28.760 --> 40:29.570
Thanks.

40:29.605 --> 40:32.123
Welcome back.

40:32.158 --> 40:35.123
Your reinstatement is
effective immediately.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.962
All right. Vacation's over.
Back to work.

40:37.997 --> 40:40.146
Just a... Just a second.

40:47.924 --> 40:49.477
Monk,

40:50.668 --> 40:52.020
thanks.

41:03.163 --> 41:04.576
Don't give up.

41:06.579 --> 41:09.449
Wait a minute.
Is that an order?

41:09.484 --> 41:11.289
Yes, it is.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.899
How'd you guess thejelly beans?

41:21.934 --> 41:23.732
Sharona. Sharona,
just give me the shoe.

41:23.767 --> 41:24.536
No.

41:24.571 --> 41:26.031
Not until you tell me.

41:26.066 --> 41:28.079
Come on.
This is not funny.

41:28.114 --> 41:29.308
I can't walk.

41:29.343 --> 41:31.369
How did you do it?

41:32.598 --> 41:34.133
All right, I'll tell you.

41:34.168 --> 41:35.605
As we walked into the carnival,

41:35.640 --> 41:36.957
there was a pile of garbage.

41:36.992 --> 41:38.190
Pile of garbage?

41:38.225 --> 41:40.373
Yes, and I noticed that
they were throwing away...

41:40.408 --> 41:42.560
some empty jelly bean boxes.

41:42.595 --> 41:43.830
They were labeled.

41:43.865 --> 41:46.137
Each one contained 1,400 jelly beans.

41:46.172 --> 41:47.284
There were six boxes,

41:47.319 --> 41:49.797
so that's 8,400 beans.

41:49.832 --> 41:51.187
You figure the kid who ran the game

41:51.222 --> 41:54.187
ate a couple of handfuls, so that's 8,385.

41:54.702 --> 41:57.702
Now, can I have my shoe, please?

42:05.616 --> 42:08.616
You remembered how many
empty boxes you saw?

42:08.942 --> 42:11.942
Yes. It's a blessing and curse.

42:13.185 --> 42:16.185
Please don't ever take my shoes again.

42:18.379 --> 42:19.896
It's not funny.

42:19.931 --> 42:21.265
It never will be funny.

42:21.300 --> 42:22.997
It won't be funny the next time you do it.

42:23.032 --> 42:24.693
Stop laughing.
