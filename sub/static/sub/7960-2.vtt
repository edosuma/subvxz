Door!

00:08.007 --> 00:09.006
Door!

00:09.008 --> 00:10.541
Anybody hear that?!

00:12.679 --> 00:14.345
Mike, I was upstairs.

00:14.347 --> 00:17.315
Well, that's why I yelled.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.154
Hey, thank you.

00:22.155 --> 00:24.522
Oh, not that you deserve this,

00:24.524 --> 00:26.357
but I think this is
your present.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.293
Okay, I'm not even gonna
try to fake it.

00:28.294 --> 00:30.662
I forgot all about
whatever special day it is,

00:30.663 --> 00:34.599
every day
with you is a gift.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.803
No special day, but...

00:37.804 --> 00:39.904
I just wanted
to get you something.

00:39.906 --> 00:41.173
I know how you love the gadgets.

00:41.174 --> 00:43.175
Oh, is it one of those new
Dick Tracy phone watches?

00:43.176 --> 00:44.743
Me and Carl been
dying to get 'em.

00:44.744 --> 00:45.743
Better.

00:45.745 --> 00:47.912
It's a step counter.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.884
Oh.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.219
Huh?

00:54.220 --> 00:56.889
You know how you're always
talking about taking more walks

00:56.890 --> 00:58.823
and getting into better shape.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.092
Eh, doesn't sound
like me, but go on.

01:02.862 --> 01:06.798
No, w-with this, you can track
every mile you walk every day.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.102
Ah, you mean you can track
every mile I don't walk every day.

01:11.104 --> 01:13.471
No. No.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.041
I mean, I can.

01:16.042 --> 01:18.377
But that's... it's not
why I'm getting it.

01:18.378 --> 01:20.012
I mean, I'm getting it
so we can do it together.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.413
Look.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.981
It's got a twinsie.

01:23.983 --> 01:26.685
Wow, that is so cute.

01:26.686 --> 01:28.853
I don't want to wear it.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.324
Well, listen.

01:32.325 --> 01:34.192
I know I can't make you do

01:34.194 --> 01:36.360
anything that you
don't want to do.

01:36.362 --> 01:38.030
Yes, you can.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.497
No.

01:39.499 --> 01:40.799
No, I can't.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.203
'Cause you are too smart

All right.

02:27.767 --> 02:29.634
So it's 40 steps
from the car to here.

02:29.635 --> 02:31.202
What's your total for the day?

02:32.772 --> 02:34.638
52.

02:36.809 --> 02:38.410
What? How the hell

02:38.411 --> 02:40.312
did you only walk 12 steps
at the station house?

02:40.313 --> 02:43.814
Well, easy,
our desk chairs have wheels.

02:44.984 --> 02:46.585
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

02:46.586 --> 02:49.787
Our freezer broke,
so the soup of the day is ice cream.

02:51.290 --> 02:54.326
Uh, just dry toast for me.
Really?

02:54.327 --> 02:56.595
Well, I may not be getting in
as many steps as I want,

02:56.596 --> 02:59.096
but I am still trying
to watch what I eat.

02:59.098 --> 03:01.099
Oh, good for you.
Uh, I, on the other hand,

03:01.100 --> 03:03.134
ran six miles this morning,
so I'm-a have the BLT

03:03.135 --> 03:05.703
with pistachio... "gazpach-io."

03:08.307 --> 03:09.641
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

03:09.642 --> 03:11.475
Now, make sure that that's
wheat toast and not white.

03:11.477 --> 03:13.411
White bread is mostly sugar,

03:13.412 --> 03:15.846
which we all know
is basically poison.

03:15.848 --> 03:17.148
Got it, hold the poison.

03:17.149 --> 03:18.983
Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on.

03:18.985 --> 03:22.287
Uh, I did read somewhere that butter
is now good for us again,

03:22.288 --> 03:26.423
so, uh, a little bit
of butter, but no jelly.

03:26.425 --> 03:27.825
So just bread and butter?

03:27.827 --> 03:28.859
And bacon.

03:28.861 --> 03:30.528
Yeah.

03:30.529 --> 03:33.031
Because I need protein
for energy.

03:33.032 --> 03:35.266
And, you know, I should
probably have some vegetables.

03:35.268 --> 03:37.935
Perhaps lettuce and tomato?

03:39.105 --> 03:40.604
That could work.

03:42.074 --> 03:43.675
So one BLT and one order

03:43.676 --> 03:46.910
of toast with bacon,
lettuce and tomato.

03:48.014 --> 03:50.547
And butter.

03:54.220 --> 03:55.486
What?

03:55.488 --> 03:57.621
Have you noticed
how good your wife looks?

03:57.623 --> 03:58.723
Yeah, so?

03:58.724 --> 03:59.758
I thought the two of you
were supposed

03:59.759 --> 04:00.758
to be on the same program.

04:00.760 --> 04:01.760
Look, she's had a head start.

04:01.761 --> 04:03.061
She's been walking for weeks.

04:03.062 --> 04:04.763
Besides, we're not gonna
share the same results

04:04.764 --> 04:06.196
due to my thick blood.

04:12.805 --> 04:14.772
Your thick blood?

04:14.774 --> 04:16.308
Yeah, it doesn't flow
through my veins

04:16.309 --> 04:17.575
as quick as other people,

04:17.576 --> 04:19.310
so calories don't burn off
at the same rate.

04:19.312 --> 04:21.178
I can't fight science.

04:22.615 --> 04:23.882

04:23.883 --> 04:25.216
when she's out there
stepping up her game,

04:25.217 --> 04:27.551
and you're in here
buttering your bacon?

04:28.954 --> 04:30.322
I guess she would like it

04:30.323 --> 04:31.922
if I showed a little more effort.
That's right.

04:31.924 --> 04:34.591
If you won't do it for yourself,
do it for the ones you love.

04:34.593 --> 04:36.660

04:36.662 --> 04:39.396
You're always bellyaching about
being on your feet all day.

04:39.398 --> 04:40.899
See what kind of numbers
you throw up.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.433
I'll pick it up after work.

04:45.171 --> 04:46.236

No, I don't. Okay,

Oh, see, that does
nothing for me.

05:38.758 --> 05:40.792
You know, I was thinking,
maybe we could take

05:40.793 --> 05:42.460
one of those walking vacations.

05:42.461 --> 05:44.162
Like hiking the hills of Tuscany

05:44.163 --> 05:45.964
or climbing Machu Picchu.

as the climbing type.

05:57.076 --> 06:00.244
Yeah, I see him more
as a burrowing creature.

06:00.246 --> 06:03.548
No, he's coming along.
You know, at his own pace.

06:03.549 --> 06:06.216

09:53.045 --> 09:54.911
Shut up!

09:59.084 --> 10:00.417
Hey.

10:00.419 --> 10:01.653
Hey.

10:01.654 --> 10:03.920
I thought we should
clear the air.

10:05.257 --> 10:06.524
I would like that.

10:06.525 --> 10:08.358
Okay.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.627
Do you know what this is?

10:10.629 --> 10:13.363
A bowling ball.

10:13.365 --> 10:15.333
Not <i> a</i> bowling ball.

10:15.334 --> 10:18.503
<i>Your</i> bowling ball that I bought
for you three Christmases ago.

10:18.504 --> 10:21.872
The orange Lady Brunswick
that you never used.

10:21.874 --> 10:23.074
But did I get angry?

10:23.075 --> 10:24.107
Nope.

10:24.109 --> 10:25.476
I realized it wasn't your thing,

10:25.477 --> 10:27.045
and I let it go.

10:27.046 --> 10:29.146
Let it go.

10:29.148 --> 10:30.515
Well, I'm sorry.

10:30.516 --> 10:31.949
I just wanted us to be healthy

10:31.950 --> 10:33.217
and I thought I figured out

10:33.218 --> 10:35.285
a fun way for us
to do it together.

10:35.287 --> 10:36.421
Well, I'm sorry.

10:36.422 --> 10:37.954
It's not as easy for me
as it is for you.

10:37.956 --> 10:39.057
You know that I have...

10:39.058 --> 10:40.892
If you say "thick blood"
one more time,

10:40.893 --> 10:44.027
I'm gonna splatter it
all over the floor.

10:44.029 --> 10:46.464
Yeah, well, good luck,
it runs like maple syrup.

10:46.465 --> 10:48.265
Look, I'm just saying

10:48.267 --> 10:50.834
I don't like exercising
as much as you do.

10:50.836 --> 10:52.904
Nobody likes exercising.

10:52.905 --> 10:54.838
They like how they feel
when they're done.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.874
In other words,
when they're not exercising.

10:59.311 --> 11:03.213
Honey, I know how hard it is
to get started up again,

11:03.215 --> 11:04.248
but it is worth it.

11:04.249 --> 11:05.416
Look at all these clothes.

11:05.417 --> 11:06.984
They're too big!
I'm getting rid of them.

11:06.985 --> 11:08.618
How exciting is that?

11:08.620 --> 11:11.055
Yeah, but don't you think you
should hold on to some of those?

11:11.056 --> 11:13.825
Why? Well, you're doing good
at this walking thing now,

11:13.826 --> 11:15.493
but, I mean,
you're gonna kick yourself

11:15.494 --> 11:18.161
when you need
these clothes again.

11:18.163 --> 11:19.831
Wow.

11:19.832 --> 11:22.333
Hey, listen, when they ask you
to coach Little League

11:22.334 --> 11:23.835
or maybe be
a motivational speaker,

11:23.836 --> 11:24.936
just say, "No, thanks."

11:24.937 --> 11:26.771
'Cause you suck at it!

11:26.772 --> 11:27.871
Look, I'm just saying,

11:27.873 --> 11:29.674
I've been there, okay?

11:29.675 --> 11:31.242
I lost a little weight,
got a little cocky,

11:31.243 --> 11:32.844
sold my clothes
at a garage sale.

11:32.845 --> 11:34.112
Six weeks later, I'm knocking

11:34.113 --> 11:35.513
on the neighbor's door
trying to get 'em back.

11:35.514 --> 11:36.513
It's embarrassing.

11:36.515 --> 11:37.782
You know what's embarrassing?

11:37.783 --> 11:39.050
Knocking on their door again

11:39.051 --> 11:40.550
and asking for a place
to stay tonight.

11:40.552 --> 11:42.086
Well, I'm sorry
if the truth hurts!

11:42.087 --> 11:44.855
Ow! Hey, that's got big buttons!

11:46.000 --> 11:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:56.677 --> 11:58.077
You know, I can't win with her.

11:58.078 --> 11:59.479
If I lie to her, she gets mad;

11:59.480 --> 12:02.482
if I tell her the truth, I get
a mouthful of brass buttons.

12:02.483 --> 12:03.850
That was a hideous blazer.

12:03.851 --> 12:05.885
I'm glad she got rid of it.

12:05.886 --> 12:07.320
I don't know what happened.

12:07.321 --> 12:09.322
We had a formula for success,
you know?

12:09.323 --> 12:11.858
Don't stand when you can sit,
don't sit when you can lay down.

12:11.859 --> 12:14.193
It's simple but it works.

12:14.194 --> 12:15.795
And now suddenly that's
not good enough for her.

12:15.796 --> 12:18.331
Exactly. She's trying to change
me into something I'm not.

12:18.332 --> 12:19.465
How dare she?

12:19.466 --> 12:22.334
It's like painting
over the <i> Mona Lisa.</i>

12:22.336 --> 12:25.538
Hey, I am the exact same guy
I was the day she met me,

12:25.539 --> 12:28.241
and if that's not good enough,
that's her problem, not mine.

12:28.242 --> 12:29.575
I don't know, man.

12:29.576 --> 12:31.510
It's starting to sound like
it's your problem.

12:31.512 --> 12:33.679
Hey, Molly is the one
who's changed.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.280
If anyone should feel betrayed,
it's me.

12:35.282 --> 12:37.083
'Cause she wants you
to walk more.

12:37.084 --> 12:39.285
Yeah, that's just how it starts.

12:39.286 --> 12:41.354
Next thing you know,
we're taking the stairs.

12:41.355 --> 12:42.822
Or maybe a 5K for charity.

12:42.823 --> 12:45.524
If I don't make a stand now,
who knows where this will end?

12:46.827 --> 12:49.795
Um, with you living
a long and healthy life?

12:49.796 --> 12:52.631
Oh, she'd love that.

12:58.605 --> 12:59.639
Mmm.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.940
Is Molly stress baking?

13:00.941 --> 13:02.708
I'm not stress baking.

13:02.709 --> 13:04.410
Are you stressed?
Yes.

13:04.411 --> 13:05.211
Are you baking?

13:05.212 --> 13:07.245
Yes.

13:08.215 --> 13:09.882
You know, I try to get him
on the right track

13:09.883 --> 13:11.817
and all he does
is try to sabotage me.

13:11.818 --> 13:13.119
You know what it is?

13:13.120 --> 13:15.354
I'm doing well, and it scares
the hell out of him.

13:15.355 --> 13:17.256
Men. They're always
trying to hold you down.

13:17.257 --> 13:19.024
And pull your hair.

13:21.295 --> 13:22.628
I think he'd be happy

13:22.629 --> 13:24.897
if we just sat on the couch
for the rest of our lives.

13:24.898 --> 13:26.332
They're gonna find
two old skeletons

13:26.333 --> 13:28.234
with an old pizza box
between 'em.

13:28.235 --> 13:30.435
Wait a minute,
I'm good at these riddles.

13:32.906 --> 13:34.539
Was the pizza poisoned?

13:36.410 --> 13:38.944
Yeah. Mystery solved.

13:40.747 --> 13:43.816
You didn't really expect
him to start hopping to

13:43.817 --> 13:46.185
once you got that stupid
thing on his wrist, did you?

13:46.186 --> 13:47.653
I mean, I didn't expect the guy

13:47.654 --> 13:49.822
to start walking across America
like Forrest Gump,

13:49.823 --> 13:52.391
but I thought I'd get
one block out of him.

13:54.895 --> 13:56.629
Okay.

13:56.630 --> 13:57.597
Ooh.

13:57.598 --> 14:00.032
There we go.

14:00.033 --> 14:01.701
These turned out nice, huh?

14:01.702 --> 14:02.768
They're beautiful.

14:02.769 --> 14:04.936
Nothing like fresh-baked cookies.
Yeah.

14:10.143 --> 14:12.178
I told you I wouldn't eat any.

14:12.179 --> 14:14.379
Yeah.

14:15.616 --> 14:18.883
♪ ♪

14:22.489 --> 14:24.223
Look at this neighborhood.

14:24.224 --> 14:27.093
Remember when it was filled with
prostitutes and drug dealers?

14:27.094 --> 14:28.261
Mm-hmm.

14:28.262 --> 14:30.129
Now it's filled
with bearded hipsters

14:30.130 --> 14:32.164
making artisanal pickles.

14:32.165 --> 14:34.367
I hate hipsters
and I hate change.

14:34.368 --> 14:37.403
But you love artisanal pickles.

14:37.404 --> 14:39.872
I do.

14:39.873 --> 14:40.873
See?

14:40.874 --> 14:42.275
Not all change is bad.

14:42.276 --> 14:44.610
You know, I never
asked her to change.

14:44.611 --> 14:45.878
I like the woman I married.

14:45.879 --> 14:47.546
I love the woman I married.

14:47.547 --> 14:49.148
Hey, she's still the same woman.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.883
No, she's not.

14:50.884 --> 14:52.551
She's 10,000 steps ahead of me

14:52.552 --> 14:54.686
and getting further away
every day.

14:56.189 --> 14:58.057
Well, I guess there's
only one thing to do.

14:58.058 --> 14:59.191
What's that?

14:59.192 --> 15:00.393
Let her go.

15:00.394 --> 15:01.861
I mean, you said it yourself.

15:01.862 --> 15:03.496
You're not gonna change,
so you may as well go back

15:03.497 --> 15:04.963
to the way you were
before you met her.

15:04.965 --> 15:07.533
You know, just living
in your sad-ass apartment.

15:07.534 --> 15:10.802
Using towels for curtains
and T-shirts for towels.

15:11.705 --> 15:14.840
God knows what you
used for toilet paper.

15:14.841 --> 15:16.809
Don't be ridiculous.

15:16.810 --> 15:18.276
I'm not the one
being ridiculous.

15:18.278 --> 15:19.812
Now, if you're not willing
to get off your ass

15:19.813 --> 15:22.415
and be a part of your marriage,
then you deserve to lose her.

15:22.416 --> 15:23.416
That's enough.

15:23.417 --> 15:24.350
Pull over.

15:24.351 --> 15:25.851
I tell you this
for your own good.

15:25.852 --> 15:27.019
I said pull over.

15:30.724 --> 15:32.124
Yeah. Don't listen.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.592
But I got news for you, pal!

15:33.593 --> 15:36.227
It's not your blood
that's thick, it's your head!

15:46.340 --> 15:47.873
Where'd you get that cookie?

15:47.874 --> 15:49.375
You know damn well
where I got it.

15:49.376 --> 15:51.877
Stay out of my shame.

15:51.878 --> 15:54.313
Hey, is Mike down here?

15:54.314 --> 15:55.381
Nope.

15:55.382 --> 15:57.650
Just me and the Cookie Monster.

15:57.651 --> 16:00.052
I called Carl and he said
Mike got out of the car

16:00.053 --> 16:01.686
in the middle of nowhere
last night.

16:01.688 --> 16:02.888
Did you try his cell phone?

16:02.889 --> 16:04.390
It just goes straight through
to voice mail.

16:04.391 --> 16:05.424
This isn't like him.

16:05.425 --> 16:06.592
Okay, honey.

16:06.593 --> 16:07.526
Just-just relax.

16:07.527 --> 16:08.527
I'm sure he's fine.

16:08.528 --> 16:10.663
Right, Vince?
I don't know.

16:10.664 --> 16:12.631
Sometimes even the nicest guys
lead a double life.

16:12.632 --> 16:14.600
Remember that preacher
from Florida?

16:14.601 --> 16:16.168
Had three different families.

16:16.169 --> 16:18.237
One of the wives found out,

16:18.238 --> 16:20.138
fed his gonads to a gator.

16:21.541 --> 16:24.809
Come on, Mike barely has
enough energy for one family.

16:25.612 --> 16:27.779
This is not helping.

16:28.648 --> 16:31.217
Oh, God. Mike!

16:33.653 --> 16:35.287
Where have you been?

16:35.288 --> 16:37.489
I went for a little walk.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.928
But... 25,000 steps?

16:42.929 --> 16:45.063
That... that-that's 13 miles.

16:45.065 --> 16:47.133
Yeah. 11 intentional,
two 'cause I got lost.

16:47.134 --> 16:48.166
Are you...

16:48.168 --> 16:51.537
Your poor feet
must be killing you.

16:51.538 --> 16:53.205
Oh, not at all.

16:53.206 --> 16:56.274
I haven't felt them for hours.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.411
You didn't have
to do this for me.

16:58.412 --> 16:59.478
Oh, I did.

16:59.479 --> 17:00.746
I really did,

17:00.747 --> 17:03.348
'cause I sure as hell
didn't do it for me.

17:04.818 --> 17:07.453
This may be the sweetest
thing anyone has ever done.

17:07.454 --> 17:08.587
And guess what.

17:08.588 --> 17:10.955
You and I are going bowling tonight.
Tonight?

17:10.957 --> 17:12.758
No. Maybe... maybe
another night.

17:12.759 --> 17:14.193
Maybe another night.

17:14.194 --> 17:17.930
I'm just glad I got all
this walking over with.

17:17.931 --> 17:19.397
Yeah...

17:19.398 --> 17:23.602
It's... it's never really over.

17:23.603 --> 17:25.771
All right, well,
since we're being honest,

17:25.771 --> 17:28.207
I'm probably gonna keep
fighting you on this.

17:28.208 --> 17:29.442
Oh.

17:29.443 --> 17:31.876
I love that you still
think you have a choice.

17:45.478 --> 17:47.345
We gotta start parking
farther away from Abe's.

17:47.346 --> 17:48.879
I'm never gonna hit
my goal today.

17:48.881 --> 17:51.750
hitting goals, parking far.

17:51.751 --> 17:54.518
You're giving that thick blood
a run for its money.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.288
I'm telling you, Carl,

17:56.289 --> 17:58.323
once you start exercising,
you feel those endorphins,

17:58.324 --> 17:59.658
you're not gonna want to stop.

17:59.659 --> 18:00.658
Thank you.

18:00.660 --> 18:02.194
I'll think about
that sage advice

18:02.195 --> 18:04.361
while I'm running my triathlon
this weekend.

18:04.363 --> 18:05.831
Just let me have this.

18:07.066 --> 18:08.732
Okay, I gotta get some steps in.
You want a warm-up?

18:08.734 --> 18:09.968
I would.
All right.

18:09.969 --> 18:11.203
As long as you're chasing
those endorphins,

18:11.204 --> 18:12.270
I'll take a Danish, too.

18:12.271 --> 18:13.672
One Danish, coming up.

18:13.673 --> 18:15.507
Uh, what's going on?

18:15.508 --> 18:17.942
Mike finally figured out
what his feet are for.

18:19.345 --> 18:21.245
Aw, baby's first steps.

18:21.247 --> 18:23.348
Are those
going to table six?

18:23.349 --> 18:24.749
I'd be happy to walk
them over for you.

18:24.750 --> 18:27.219
Yes.
All right. I got this.

18:27.220 --> 18:28.620
Why don't you take a load off?

18:28.621 --> 18:29.821
Thank you.
All right,

18:29.822 --> 18:30.989
I'll check on that two-top
in the corner, too.

18:30.990 --> 18:31.990
They're getting a little antsy.

18:31.991 --> 18:33.491
I think they're ready to order.

18:36.696 --> 18:39.063
So, what's good here?
