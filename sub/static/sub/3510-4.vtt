00:01.499 --> 00:02.698
Previously on "Castle"...

00:02.733 --> 00:05.338
Four years ago, the
Triple Killer, or 3XK,

00:05.339 --> 00:07.615
took the lives of 6 women
because we didn't stop him.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.846
The man that we're looking
for is Marcus Gates.

00:09.847 --> 00:12.591
When Gates got released, he gave
all of his stuff to Jerry Tyson,

00:12.592 --> 00:13.551
a fellow inmate.

00:13.552 --> 00:16.178
We just need a little more
information on Marcus Gates.

00:16.178 --> 00:18.149
Don't you guys get it?
I'm a dead man.

00:18.254 --> 00:20.116
Not if we get you
police protection.

00:20.117 --> 00:22.850
For your own safety, you
cannot leave or use the phone.

00:22.885 --> 00:24.351
Mr. Gates, did you
kill Kim Foster?

00:24.386 --> 00:26.246
Yes. I killed all of them.

00:26.247 --> 00:27.616
He confessed. It's all over.

00:27.765 --> 00:28.454
Thank God.

00:28.455 --> 00:29.690
Aren't you gonna
ask what happened?

00:29.974 --> 00:32.220
It was him all along.
He's the real Triple Killer.

00:37.388 --> 00:38.376
Guilty as charged.

00:38.588 --> 00:40.690
You won't get far.
They already have your name,

00:40.724 --> 00:41.484
know your face.

00:41.485 --> 00:43.226
I'll change those.
Done that before.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.727
I'll relocate. I'll start over.

00:44.761 --> 00:46.762
It must eat you alive,

00:46.797 --> 00:49.398
knowing that you came so
close to catching me.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

01:28.100 --> 01:30.920
Grande skim latte, two
pumps sugar-free vanilla.

01:30.968 --> 01:33.337
Castle, I think you read my mind.

01:35.107 --> 01:36.307
Surgery?

01:36.341 --> 01:37.541
Yeah.

01:37.576 --> 01:39.642
Sometimes the scar pulls a bit.

01:39.677 --> 01:42.312
And you still don't remember
anything about that day?

01:42.346 --> 01:43.947
No. It's a blank.

01:48.619 --> 01:49.512
Wow.

01:49.733 --> 01:52.119
Who knew cement overcoats
would be back for fall?

01:52.284 --> 01:55.225
I need to chisel out the concrete
by hand before I can autopsy,

01:55.226 --> 01:57.262
but it's pretty clear
she was shot to death.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.285
Found these two
slugs in the dirt.

01:59.616 --> 02:01.107
Looks to be a 9-millimeter.

02:01.108 --> 02:02.321
Guy was a pro.

02:02.355 --> 02:03.223
Double tap.

02:03.547 --> 02:05.281
One in the back of
the head, she falls,

02:05.315 --> 02:07.016
then he hits her
again to make sure.

02:07.050 --> 02:08.297
Buries her in the sand.

02:08.469 --> 02:09.768
And then waits for
the cement truck

02:09.801 --> 02:11.770
to come in in the morning
to finish off the job.

02:11.804 --> 02:13.839
Execution-style murder,
cement trucks--

02:13.873 --> 02:15.741
can anyone else say mob hit?

02:15.775 --> 02:17.809
I'm looking at concrete
evidence right here.

02:17.844 --> 02:18.936
Is that purse from in here?

02:19.114 --> 02:22.183
Yeah. According to her
Pearce College ID,

02:22.217 --> 02:24.345
our victim's name
is Jane Herzfeld.

02:25.342 --> 02:26.986
A college student?

02:27.021 --> 02:29.555
That's not a typical mob victim.

02:32.603 --> 02:34.013
Called in a favor to ballistics.

02:34.014 --> 02:35.482
We should get results today.

02:35.517 --> 02:36.917
Did you reach the next of kin?

02:36.951 --> 02:38.652
Her mother's on her way in.

02:38.687 --> 02:40.653
Jane was an only child.

02:40.688 --> 02:42.088
That's a hell of a thing.

02:42.122 --> 02:43.423
Yeah.

02:43.457 --> 02:44.976
She also had a
roommate-- in Michigan

02:44.977 --> 02:46.478
visiting her folks, but
she's back tomorrow.

02:47.194 --> 02:49.629
What was this girl into that
got her dumped into a ditch?

02:49.663 --> 02:50.161
As far as I can tell,

02:50.162 --> 02:51.815
all she was into was
tutoring other students.

02:51.899 --> 02:53.467
She was booked solid
for the day she died.

02:53.501 --> 02:56.626
What's weird is that she canceled
her appointments that morning.

02:57.237 --> 02:59.105
Her students say that
it wasn't like her.

02:59.139 --> 03:00.639
She was super conscientious.

03:00.674 --> 03:02.474
Did she tell them why
she was canceling?

03:02.509 --> 03:05.044
All she said was, something
important had come up.

03:05.569 --> 03:07.613
Maybe she knew she
was in trouble.

03:10.150 --> 03:13.186
I'm putting the time of death
between 10:00 and 12 midnight.

03:13.349 --> 03:15.731
And I found this.

03:17.694 --> 03:18.828
Bruising,

03:18.862 --> 03:20.630
no more than a day old.

03:20.664 --> 03:22.932
He must have grabbed her,
maybe forced her into a car?

03:22.966 --> 03:26.143
Also, I found traces of
cocaine residue on her shirt,

03:26.144 --> 03:27.911
but the preliminary tox is clean.

03:27.945 --> 03:29.579
No drugs or alcohol
in her system.

03:29.613 --> 03:31.072
The killer could've
transferred it to her shirt

03:31.073 --> 03:32.434
when he walked her
to the murder site.

03:32.678 --> 03:34.484
From the looks of it...

03:34.518 --> 03:36.218
she knew she was gonna die.

03:36.579 --> 03:39.463
I found this clutched
in her fist.

03:41.981 --> 03:44.881
He let her say a prayer
before he shot her.

03:44.916 --> 03:46.148
That's not very professional.

03:46.304 --> 03:47.203
No.

03:48.009 --> 03:49.680
More like Jane knew her killer.

03:50.678 --> 03:52.269
When I didn't hear
from her last night,

03:52.270 --> 03:53.571
I knew something was wrong.

03:53.605 --> 03:55.470
We always talked at
the end of the day.

03:55.471 --> 03:58.438
Mrs. Herzfeld, Jane was tutoring
people to make extra cash.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.173
Do you know why she canceled all
of her appointments yesterday?

04:01.951 --> 04:04.563
Is it possible that Jane was doing
something other than tutoring,

04:04.742 --> 04:06.046
something that might have
gotten her into trouble?

04:06.065 --> 04:08.114
Something like what?

04:10.512 --> 04:13.115
Look, we didn't find any
drugs in Jane's system,

04:13.116 --> 04:15.750
but the ME did find traces
of cocaine on her clothes.

04:15.785 --> 04:18.387
Jane would never be
involved with drugs!

04:20.156 --> 04:22.500
Yeah, but she might have been
involved with people who were.

04:22.983 --> 04:25.378
And we think that she
knew her killer.

04:28.488 --> 04:30.689
There was a boyfriend
I didn't like.

04:30.723 --> 04:32.376
They broke up five months ago.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.392
And what did you not
like about him?

04:34.426 --> 04:36.101
He wouldn't meet my eye.

04:36.481 --> 04:38.182
They would fight.

04:38.216 --> 04:40.284
I saw bruises on her.

04:40.318 --> 04:42.419
Do you remember his name?

04:42.688 --> 04:44.385
Finbar Joseph McQueen,

04:44.587 --> 04:45.794
a.k.a. Finn.

04:45.956 --> 04:49.058
Did a deuce on cocaine charges,
possession with intent.

04:49.093 --> 04:52.394
Well, that could explain the
residue Lanie found on her body.

04:52.429 --> 04:54.363
B&E, simple assault...

04:54.397 --> 04:55.865
There's nothing gun related.

04:55.899 --> 04:57.232
Maybe he decided to
step up the game.

04:57.233 --> 04:58.602
Do we have a location
on this guy?

04:58.636 --> 04:59.469
Yeah, that's the best part.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.200
Talked to McQueen's
parole officer.

05:01.234 --> 05:05.037
He says that McQueen is doing
a job at 645 West 98th Street.

05:05.239 --> 05:06.572
Construction.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.542
I can't believe it.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.343
I can't believe she's dead.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.693
When is the last
time you saw Jane?

05:12.856 --> 05:14.823
Um...

05:14.858 --> 05:16.157
a couple weeks ago.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.959
But you--you broke up in April,

05:17.993 --> 05:20.595
so... you stayed in touch?

05:20.630 --> 05:22.964
Uh, I-I was her friend, yeah.
I...

05:22.998 --> 05:25.199
I-I help her out every now and then.
I, uh...

05:25.234 --> 05:26.563
l-lent her money once,
she paid me back.

05:26.564 --> 05:27.481
You know, like-- like that.

05:28.465 --> 05:29.966
Did Jane have money problems?

05:30.240 --> 05:31.006
And as a friend,

05:31.007 --> 05:33.368
did you maybe tell her that
you could hook her up,

05:33.402 --> 05:34.815
got her involved in something
she couldn't handle?

05:34.894 --> 05:36.828
Jane wouldn't ever do
anything that wasn't legit.

05:36.862 --> 05:38.964
- Beckett.
- If that's what you're implying.

05:38.998 --> 05:40.466
Jane was a good girl.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.866
What?

05:41.901 --> 05:42.867
That's why it ended with her.

05:42.902 --> 05:44.269
Are you sure?

05:44.304 --> 05:45.770
She wanted me to go straight.

05:45.805 --> 05:48.272
And there's no chance
that's a mistake?

05:48.307 --> 05:49.773
I just couldn't.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.210
I kept telling her...

05:53.245 --> 05:55.646
this is who I am.

05:58.917 --> 06:00.017
Don't move.

06:06.524 --> 06:07.957
My man Finn,

06:07.992 --> 06:09.792
inches from confessing.

06:11.583 --> 06:12.258
What?

06:12.997 --> 06:14.164
What's going on?

06:14.198 --> 06:16.533
Ballistics just came in.

06:16.567 --> 06:18.600
The bullet that
killed Jane Herzfeld

06:18.601 --> 06:20.255
is from a gun that's
in our system.

06:20.256 --> 06:21.913
It's a Glock 17.

06:22.426 --> 06:23.379
W--

06:23.880 --> 06:24.828
That's good news.

06:26.988 --> 06:30.690
Ryan, it's a match to
your old service weapon.

06:32.734 --> 06:34.093
That can't be right.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.061
It's not a mistake.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.031
The weapon that killed
Jane Herzfeld...

06:40.700 --> 06:42.123
it's yours.

06:48.863 --> 06:54.026
Sync by YYeTs, corrections by Alex1969
www.addic7ed.com

07:06.868 --> 07:10.203
She was holding a cross in
her hand when she died.

07:11.673 --> 07:14.441
She was praying for mercy.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.443
And then...

07:16.478 --> 07:19.079
she heard him pull the trigger...

07:19.113 --> 07:21.413
of my gun.

07:21.448 --> 07:24.006
We were working the 3XK
serial murders last year.

07:24.372 --> 07:27.262
We had a suspect in custody who
had given us a full confession,

07:27.402 --> 07:29.463
at which time, Castle and
I went to the motel--

07:29.464 --> 07:30.545
Castle was with you?

07:30.702 --> 07:34.670
Yeah, the NYPD sequestered Jerry
Tyson at a motel as a witness,

07:34.705 --> 07:37.239
and Castle and Ryan went over
there to give him the all clear.

07:37.584 --> 07:41.094
At which time you realized
that Tyson actually was 3XK?

07:41.328 --> 07:41.948
Yes, sir.

07:42.155 --> 07:45.224
Tyson got the drop on us and
left with my gun and badge.

07:45.258 --> 07:47.226
Look, detective Ryan was
cleared of all wrongdoing

07:47.260 --> 07:48.493
by the IAB.

07:48.528 --> 07:50.495
I don't care whose fault it is.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.697
All I care about is
mitigating the damage,

07:52.732 --> 07:54.699
which means we track
down Jerry Tyson

07:54.734 --> 07:56.167
like the animal he is

07:56.202 --> 07:58.002
and we haul him into custody.

07:58.037 --> 07:59.003
Yes, sir.

08:02.841 --> 08:03.349
You okay?

08:03.408 --> 08:05.675
I will be when Jerry
Tyson's in cuffs.

08:09.298 --> 08:10.664
Beckett,

08:10.698 --> 08:12.533
McQueen's alibi checks out.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.535
Waitress confirms he
was at Angeli's Diner

08:14.569 --> 08:16.070
on the East Side until closing.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.604
All right. Cut him loose.

08:20.506 --> 08:21.279
You know, Ryan,

08:21.448 --> 08:23.085
if Tyson is the shooter,

08:23.086 --> 08:24.183
that explains Jane.

08:24.217 --> 08:26.285
No direct motive, just
fits his profile--

08:26.319 --> 08:27.619
she's young, she's blonde.

08:27.654 --> 08:29.889
But 3XK strangled
those other women.

08:29.923 --> 08:31.723
Why would he use a gun now?

08:31.758 --> 08:33.321
He told me he likes
to change up his M.O.

08:33.322 --> 08:35.698
Yeah. He must have mentioned that
when I was out cold on the floor.

08:36.581 --> 08:38.063
You know, Ryan, none
of this is your fault.

08:38.328 --> 08:39.452
The fact that he used your gun--

08:39.453 --> 08:41.688
That weapon was issued to
me by the city of New York.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.890
I let it out of my hand,
and now a girl is dead.

08:43.924 --> 08:47.194
So please do not tell me
that it's not my fault.

08:50.665 --> 08:52.633
I'm gonna start a canvass
at Jane's apartment,

08:52.667 --> 08:54.134
have 'em show Tyson's
photo around,

08:54.168 --> 08:56.136
find out when Jane's
roommate's back in town.

08:56.170 --> 08:57.637
Okay.

09:03.144 --> 09:04.611
It's a cop thing, Castle.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.645
No. No, I get it.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.647
Yo. CSU pulled information

09:07.681 --> 09:09.616
off Jane's Metro card
and ATM records.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.450
She spent most of yesterday
at Grand Central Station.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.452
Yeah, over a 4-hour period,

09:13.486 --> 09:16.488
she made... multiple
withdrawals out of three ATMs

09:16.523 --> 09:18.290
in and around the train station--

09:18.324 --> 09:20.292
$800 worth.

09:20.546 --> 09:21.629
So she canceled a day of work

09:21.630 --> 09:24.214
to hang out at a train station
and empty her bank account?

09:24.215 --> 09:25.538
That was the important
thing that came up?

09:25.539 --> 09:26.973
I'll send a team over
there first thing.

09:27.007 --> 09:27.875
Have 'em talk to vendors,

09:27.876 --> 09:28.843
see if anybody
remembers seeing her.

09:28.948 --> 09:29.742
Or Tyson.

09:30.669 --> 09:33.646
He stalked his victims
before he killed them.

09:37.736 --> 09:39.797
It's like I've been holding
my breath for a year,

09:39.983 --> 09:42.520
waiting for this day to come.

09:42.555 --> 09:44.422
A whole year of
wondering about him,

09:44.456 --> 09:45.691
hating him,

09:45.725 --> 09:47.192
dreaming about him,

09:47.226 --> 09:49.627
trying to think like him.

09:49.662 --> 09:52.130
But still having no
clue how to catch him.

09:52.165 --> 09:55.000
It's not your job to
catch a serial killer.

09:55.034 --> 09:56.768
Because I'm not a cop.

09:57.646 --> 10:00.582
I like to pretend I'm Beckett's
partner and like I'm one of them,

10:00.583 --> 10:03.741
but days like today,
I realize, I...

10:03.775 --> 10:05.298
that I've just been playacting.

10:05.358 --> 10:06.067
Oh...

10:06.068 --> 10:10.565
Your playacting once helped saved
New York City as I recall.

10:12.495 --> 10:14.699
Be there for your friends.

10:14.733 --> 10:17.034
Stand beside them, work together.

10:17.068 --> 10:19.203
That's plenty useful.

10:19.237 --> 10:20.872
Trust me.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.048
I'm sorry. I don't know him.

10:31.082 --> 10:33.569
Jane and I were only
roommates for six months.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.888
Maybe he was the guy
she was seeing.

10:38.123 --> 10:39.723
Jane had a boyfriend?

10:39.757 --> 10:41.441
She wouldn't tell me about him,

10:41.442 --> 10:43.350
and... she wouldn't
let him come around.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.720
Why wouldn't Jane talk about him?

10:44.721 --> 10:46.855
She said that he had some
things he needed to figure out

10:46.890 --> 10:48.123
before they could go public.

10:48.158 --> 10:50.293
Honestly, I just thought,
maybe he was married.

10:50.327 --> 10:53.195
Then, like, six weeks ago...

10:53.229 --> 10:55.030
Things changed.

10:55.064 --> 10:56.399
Changed how?

10:56.433 --> 10:58.401
She was crying all the time

10:58.435 --> 11:00.135
and she would get phone
calls really late at night

11:00.170 --> 11:01.703
and be really upset afterwards.

11:01.737 --> 11:03.371
Do you remember a
specific time or day

11:03.406 --> 11:05.072
when Jane got one of these calls?

11:05.107 --> 11:06.608
Last Thursday.

11:06.642 --> 11:08.576
A-around 11:00.

11:09.516 --> 11:11.813
Thursday night at 11:04,
Jane got a call on her cell.

11:11.847 --> 11:13.815
Our guys say that call
originated on a pay phone

11:13.849 --> 11:15.750
in Sammy's bar in midtown.

11:15.785 --> 11:18.602
Two calls a week to the same
number over the last six weeks?

11:18.603 --> 11:19.453
It's him.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.757
I've seen her, couple of times.

11:24.385 --> 11:26.259
Yeah, came in with Seth.

11:26.294 --> 11:27.461
Is this Seth?

11:27.495 --> 11:28.610
Nah. That ain't him.

11:28.611 --> 11:31.000
You sure?
Take a good look this time.

11:31.555 --> 11:32.324
Seth's a regular.

11:32.487 --> 11:33.259
That ain't him.

11:33.323 --> 11:35.253
But if you want to talk to
Seth, just stick around.

11:35.254 --> 11:37.068
He usually comes in here
pretty much every day.

11:37.230 --> 11:37.906
Doing what?

11:38.078 --> 11:39.679
He uses that phone
over there a lot.

11:39.714 --> 11:41.481
Meets with shifty
looking individuals

11:41.515 --> 11:42.982
he calls, uh, associates.

11:43.016 --> 11:45.719
One time, his jacket
rolled up in the back.

11:45.753 --> 11:46.720
He was strapped.

11:46.754 --> 11:48.054
Sounds like a drug dealer.

11:48.088 --> 11:50.389
All right, so what time
does Seth usually come in?

11:50.423 --> 11:51.390
About 3:00.

11:51.560 --> 11:52.426
Stay if you want,

11:52.529 --> 11:54.196
but I gotta get back to work.

11:57.697 --> 11:59.667
So how's Ryan holding up?

12:01.904 --> 12:04.538
Three days after my
last tour in Iraq,

12:04.572 --> 12:06.540
I'm at a diner with friends.

12:06.574 --> 12:08.241
A car backfires.

12:08.276 --> 12:10.644
My friends look around.
I'm under the table.

12:12.179 --> 12:14.681
Ryan's just waiting
for the next hit.

12:17.852 --> 12:19.022
Here's what I don't get--

12:19.353 --> 12:21.161
what's a drug dealer
doing with my gun?

12:21.623 --> 12:25.315
Well, maybe Tyson sold
it to him or tossed it,

12:25.316 --> 12:26.445
and Seth found it.

12:27.095 --> 12:28.899
That doesn't sound
like Jerry Tyson.

12:29.438 --> 12:32.573
3XK always has a plan.

12:32.607 --> 12:34.409
So maybe Seth is a patsy.

12:40.748 --> 12:42.582
How you feeling, Jo-Jo?

12:42.983 --> 12:44.718
Hey, Seth, how's it going?

12:44.752 --> 12:46.457
Ah, keeping outta trouble. You?

12:46.458 --> 12:49.227
Looks like you'll be able
to ask him yourself.

12:49.826 --> 12:52.199
Hey, Seth.
Detective Beckett, NYPD.

12:52.831 --> 12:54.364
Hey, whoa. Whoa. Hey!

12:54.399 --> 12:56.534
Back alley. He's on the move!
On the move!

13:02.807 --> 13:04.642
Stop! Police!

13:07.793 --> 13:08.826
NYPD!

13:09.278 --> 13:10.697
Get up against the
car, right now!

13:14.341 --> 13:15.598
Gun.

13:15.637 --> 13:16.904
It's a Glock 17.

13:19.841 --> 13:20.841
You got a permit for this?

13:20.875 --> 13:22.510
Sure do, Ponch. I'm a cop.

13:22.544 --> 13:25.545
Detective Seth Carver. Narcotics.

13:25.580 --> 13:27.113
Do me a favor

13:27.147 --> 13:29.216
and put me in the vehicle before
you blow my cover completely,

13:29.250 --> 13:30.883
will ya?

13:38.512 --> 13:39.554
So let me guess.

13:40.368 --> 13:42.302
You talked to her mom
and her girlfriends,

13:42.337 --> 13:44.138
and all of 'em said
that Jane was an angel.

13:44.172 --> 13:44.818
Am I right?

13:44.963 --> 13:46.079
So you're saying, she wasn't?

13:46.290 --> 13:47.756
I'm saying that when I met her,

13:47.790 --> 13:49.558
I was pulling her over
for blowin' a red light,

13:49.559 --> 13:51.117
and she had 2 grams in
the glove compartment.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.463
Jane didn't do drugs.

13:52.497 --> 13:53.212
What can I tell ya?

13:53.213 --> 13:54.387
Little miss was riding dirty.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.967
You--you didn't charge her.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.235
There's--there's
nothing in the system.

13:57.419 --> 13:57.953
Right.

13:58.377 --> 13:59.945
That's because when I asked
her where the coke came from,

13:59.979 --> 14:01.112
she told me Ben Lee
gave it to her.

14:01.147 --> 14:02.679
Who's Ben Lee? Who's Ben...

14:04.082 --> 14:05.582
Son of Clifford Lee.

14:09.354 --> 14:11.288
He's the head of the Han Yi Tong.

14:11.323 --> 14:13.703
Operates out of a dim sum
house on Mott Street.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.420
What's the Han Yi Tong?

14:15.455 --> 14:18.056
Uh, tongs are a Chinese
merchant organization.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.003
Most of them are legit,

14:19.004 --> 14:20.904
but some of them are a
front for the Chinese mob.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.787
So Clifford Lee would
be like the godfather.

14:23.329 --> 14:23.861
Oh, yeah.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.735
How's Jane supposed to help
you get to Clifford Lee

14:25.736 --> 14:27.635
based on one coke
buy off his kid?

14:27.670 --> 14:29.071
When it comes to education,

14:29.105 --> 14:31.006
Clifford Lee is
old-school Chinese.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.140
His sons may be
drug-dealing criminals,

14:33.175 --> 14:35.476
but they still need
to graduate college.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.279
Ben Lee was one of her students.

14:38.313 --> 14:39.347
She was tutoring him.

14:39.381 --> 14:40.936
Twice a week, she
was in their house.

14:41.457 --> 14:43.825
I told her I would drop
the possession charges

14:43.859 --> 14:45.159
if she brought me
some solid intel

14:45.194 --> 14:47.161
on Lee's criminal operations.

14:47.196 --> 14:49.197
She said okay.

14:50.187 --> 14:51.559
And somehow she tipped 'em off,

14:51.560 --> 14:54.001
and they killed her.

14:57.239 --> 14:57.909
That's it?

14:58.080 --> 15:00.382
I just handed you a solid lead.
What, he wants more?

15:00.416 --> 15:00.897
What is this?

15:00.898 --> 15:02.158
Yeah, how about the truth?

15:02.159 --> 15:03.803
Come on, Ryan. Keep it together.

15:03.973 --> 15:05.974
You expect us to believe that
you worked a case for years,

15:06.008 --> 15:07.476
and then one lucky
Saturday night,

15:07.510 --> 15:10.211
you just happen to roll
up on the perfect CI?

15:10.246 --> 15:12.381
See, I did my time in
narcotics, Carver.

15:12.415 --> 15:14.816
I know a shortcut
when I hear one.

15:14.850 --> 15:16.318
Ah, gee, Ryan.

15:16.352 --> 15:17.819
If I didn't know any better,

15:17.853 --> 15:20.488
I would think you were accusing
me of something untoward.

15:20.522 --> 15:21.489
Whoa. Hey.

15:21.523 --> 15:22.790
You targeted Jane Herzfeld.

15:22.824 --> 15:24.625
You planted those
drugs in her car,

15:24.660 --> 15:26.794
and then you made
her help you out.

15:26.828 --> 15:28.629
You--you sent her
in there alone--

15:28.664 --> 15:30.798
no backup, no protection--
and now she's dead.

15:30.832 --> 15:32.232
Yeah, well, I didn't
make her dead.

15:32.267 --> 15:33.434
The hell you didn't.

15:33.468 --> 15:34.735
You may have not
pulled the trigger,

15:34.770 --> 15:36.403
but you're as guilty
as the creep who did.

15:36.437 --> 15:38.505
What about you, man, hmm?

15:38.539 --> 15:40.040
Look at yourself.

15:40.074 --> 15:44.311
Word around the house is that
that creep used your gun.

15:44.345 --> 15:46.780
What kind of cop can't keep
hold of his own weapon?

15:48.116 --> 15:49.149
What did you say to me? Huh?

15:49.184 --> 15:50.884
Let's go. Say it to me! Say it!

15:50.919 --> 15:52.018
Say it! I want you to say it!
Say it to my--

15:52.052 --> 15:53.019
Hey, break it up.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.586
Break it up.

15:54.964 --> 15:56.048
We're all cops here.

15:56.305 --> 15:57.606
Okay?

15:58.591 --> 15:59.382
If you're all done,

15:59.641 --> 16:01.081
I think I'll take my leave now.

16:01.267 --> 16:03.435
Yeah.
Thanks for your help, Carver.

16:03.469 --> 16:04.969
You got it.

16:09.141 --> 16:10.144
What are you trying to do?

16:10.145 --> 16:11.573
You want the captain
to come in here?

16:12.811 --> 16:14.111
Go cool off.

16:29.272 --> 16:30.875
Guy's a jerk.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.736
When I started in narcotics,

16:37.538 --> 16:39.005
I was so green.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.373
I-I didn't know how
things got done.

16:41.407 --> 16:43.943
One day, there's
this major bust--

16:43.977 --> 16:45.845
a street gang cooking meth.

16:47.547 --> 16:49.015
They're stacking up
guys in the bullpen,

16:49.049 --> 16:50.750
taking their
statements one by one.

16:50.784 --> 16:51.917
Place is a zoo.

16:51.952 --> 16:53.918
I'm answering phones
in the squad.

16:53.953 --> 16:54.790
Girl on the line,

16:54.791 --> 16:58.256
name of Alisha, asking
for my lieutenant.

16:58.290 --> 17:01.018
So I call out across the bullpen,

17:01.019 --> 17:03.623
"hey, Lou, Alisha's on
the phone for you."

17:04.597 --> 17:06.964
It was her tip that got
these guys nailed,

17:06.999 --> 17:09.266
and all of 'em just heard
me call out her name.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.967
Searched all day and all night,

17:11.002 --> 17:12.903
looking for her,
before the gang could

17:12.936 --> 17:14.971
get word back to the street
that she was a narc.

17:15.006 --> 17:16.473
Did you find her?

17:16.508 --> 17:17.741
I did.

17:17.776 --> 17:20.411
Got her into Witness
Protection, but...

17:21.813 --> 17:24.847
that was the stupidest thing
I'd ever done as a cop.

17:26.849 --> 17:29.051
Until the day Jerry Tyson
got the drop on me

17:29.085 --> 17:30.586
and stole my weapon.

17:32.930 --> 17:34.400
Carver is a jerk...

17:35.293 --> 17:36.297
but he's got a point.

17:37.895 --> 17:39.929
Come on.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.838
You know what Carver could
have a point about?

17:44.019 --> 17:44.654
Is Ben Lee.

17:44.919 --> 17:46.587
If Ben did tip to Jane,

17:46.621 --> 17:48.589
then that's a strong motive.

17:48.623 --> 17:50.724
You up for a trip to Chinatown?

17:50.758 --> 17:51.758
Hell, yeah.

17:51.793 --> 17:52.802
Yo.

17:53.002 --> 17:54.302
Uniforms at Grand
Central caught a break.

17:54.336 --> 17:57.004
They found a clerk who works at a
Mailbox Center around the corner,

17:57.038 --> 17:58.939
who says he rented a box to
Jane on the day she died.

17:58.973 --> 18:00.774
I'm gonna go check it out.
You want to roll with me?

18:00.809 --> 18:01.775
No, I'm with Beckett.

18:01.810 --> 18:03.077
Castle, you want to come?

18:03.111 --> 18:04.311
Huh?

18:04.345 --> 18:06.413
I-I was just thinking...

18:06.447 --> 18:09.750
if our killer is someone
in Lee's organization,

18:09.784 --> 18:12.104
then he must have gotten
your gun from Jerry Tyson.

18:12.105 --> 18:14.195
Which means our killer may
know Tyson's whereabouts.

18:14.196 --> 18:15.761
We nail him, we nail 3XK.

18:15.796 --> 18:17.263
Yeah, but there's nothing
in Tyson's background

18:17.298 --> 18:19.532
that indicates a connection
to the Chinese mob.

18:19.567 --> 18:21.968
Maybe the shooter is
connected to the Lees--

18:22.002 --> 18:23.470
someone Tyson's
crossed paths with

18:23.504 --> 18:24.638
during his four years in prison,

18:24.639 --> 18:25.776
someone working for the Tong.

18:26.483 --> 18:29.176
If I find out who that someone
is, maybe we have our shooter.

18:29.211 --> 18:31.133
Wading through four years
of prison records--

18:31.134 --> 18:32.246
it's a lot of work.

18:32.280 --> 18:33.848
I don't mind.

18:33.882 --> 18:36.951
All right. Let's go.

19:00.655 --> 19:02.489
Detectives.

19:02.523 --> 19:04.458
I assume you're here about Jane.

19:07.328 --> 19:09.263
Please, sit.

19:10.465 --> 19:12.304
I understand Jane was
an employee of yours.

19:12.305 --> 19:13.096
Is that correct?

19:13.360 --> 19:16.195
She tutored my son Ben.
Oh, this is Ben,

19:16.229 --> 19:18.864
my other sons, Philip,
David, Steven.

19:18.898 --> 19:20.866
When was the last time
you saw Jane, Ben?

19:20.900 --> 19:22.301
Last week.

19:22.336 --> 19:24.102
We had an appointment the
day before yesterday,

19:24.137 --> 19:24.965
but she canceled.

19:24.966 --> 19:26.020
And where would you meet?

19:26.262 --> 19:28.495
Sometimes at school.
Sometimes at my house.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.897
Was Jane a good tutor?
Did you like her, Ben?

19:30.932 --> 19:31.677
She was okay?

19:31.678 --> 19:32.979
What's with all these questions?

19:34.022 --> 19:35.015
He just said he hadn't seen her.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.016
Philip.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.785
The truth is, Mr. Lee,

19:37.819 --> 19:40.086
we've uncovered some
information about Jane

19:40.121 --> 19:43.158
that a man in your line of
work might find troubling.

19:43.159 --> 19:45.324
You mean that she
was an informant?

19:46.624 --> 19:48.625
Jane told me herself,
about a month ago.

19:49.794 --> 19:52.096
She said that a bad cop

19:52.130 --> 19:54.098
had framed her

19:54.132 --> 19:55.299
and is forcing her to help him.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.202
I told her that there was nothing
to tell this man about us

19:58.236 --> 20:00.062
because we are
honest businessmen.

20:00.361 --> 20:02.195
I hoped the fofficer would
grow tired of waiting

20:02.229 --> 20:03.664
and leave her alone,

20:03.698 --> 20:06.099
but unfortunately,
that did not happen.

20:06.133 --> 20:07.935
I'm afraid your killer

20:07.969 --> 20:09.970
may be closer to
home than you think.

20:10.004 --> 20:12.172
We've already ruled
out detective Carver.

20:12.948 --> 20:14.007
Of course.

20:14.042 --> 20:15.507
And what were you...

20:15.542 --> 20:18.277
honest businessmen doing between
10:00 P.M. and midnight

20:18.311 --> 20:19.694
on the night Jane was killed?

20:19.695 --> 20:21.814
We were home,
watching television.

20:21.848 --> 20:24.183
Please feel free to speak to
any of my household staff

20:24.217 --> 20:27.820
if you wish to verify
this information.

20:34.493 --> 20:35.480
We will.

20:58.901 --> 21:00.049
Hey, dad. What's all that?

21:00.079 --> 21:01.237
Convict reports.

21:01.238 --> 21:02.709
I'm trying to figure
out which bad guy

21:02.710 --> 21:05.157
Jerry Tyson gave Ryan's gun to.

21:05.158 --> 21:06.109
Any luck?

21:06.110 --> 21:08.452
I'm looking for the proverbial
needle in a haystack.

21:08.453 --> 21:09.860
Somewhere in that
box is a link to Tyson.

21:09.861 --> 21:11.619
I'm just not seeing it.

21:11.620 --> 21:13.372
Well, I'd offer to help,

21:13.373 --> 21:15.348
but I've got all these
complaint letters to read.

21:15.349 --> 21:16.106
What, did you drop out of school

21:16.107 --> 21:17.817
and get a job in
consumer relations?

21:17.841 --> 21:18.623
No.

21:18.642 --> 21:20.194
The senior class made me

21:20.195 --> 21:22.818
their Executive Liaison
Advocate to the administration.

21:22.819 --> 21:24.466
Well, that sounds
like quite an honor.

21:24.467 --> 21:25.525
Not really.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.579
Ivy League schools look
fondly on applicants

21:28.580 --> 21:30.184
who serve in student government,

21:30.185 --> 21:31.591
and Alexis is beefing
up her resume

21:31.592 --> 21:33.036
before she reapplies to Stanford.

21:33.037 --> 21:35.820
Or anywhere, if I even
go to college at all.

21:36.609 --> 21:38.801
Chelsea's been our advocate
for the last three years,

21:38.802 --> 21:40.697
and when I told her I
wanted to be more involved,

21:40.698 --> 21:42.057
she offered to step aside

21:42.058 --> 21:43.240
and let me take
over the position.

21:43.241 --> 21:44.144
Well, that was nice of her.

21:44.145 --> 21:45.121
Not really.

21:45.122 --> 21:45.916
- Again with the not really.
- Yeah.

21:45.917 --> 21:47.621
I didn't know when
I agreed to do it,

21:47.622 --> 21:49.533
but you just sit there
for hours and hours

21:49.534 --> 21:51.086
and listen to everyone complain.

21:51.087 --> 21:52.772
I-I think Chelsea
just got tired of it,

21:52.773 --> 21:54.742
of figured she could
stick me with the job.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.460
And I thought she was my
friend, but I guess--

21:56.461 --> 21:57.623
Not really.

21:58.990 --> 22:00.040
Face it, kiddo.

22:00.041 --> 22:02.019
Chelsea set you up.

22:02.783 --> 22:04.641
She set you up.

22:06.503 --> 22:08.178
Your friend set you up.

22:12.729 --> 22:14.224
The Lees' entire household staff

22:14.225 --> 22:15.920
confirms that the
family was at home

22:15.921 --> 22:18.209
watching television the night
Jane Herzfeld was killed.

22:18.210 --> 22:19.713
Yeah, well, there's
no surprise there.

22:19.714 --> 22:21.512
Hey, how'd it go
at Grand Central?

22:21.513 --> 22:23.488
Good. I found this.

22:23.489 --> 22:25.832
Check the tag.
It belongs to Jane Herzfeld.

22:25.833 --> 22:26.728
Where was it?

22:26.729 --> 22:28.488
At the Mailbox Center
where Jane bought a box.

22:28.489 --> 22:30.553
She was using it as a
locker to hold this bag

22:30.554 --> 22:32.488
along with $500 in cash.

22:32.489 --> 22:34.025
- Hmm.
- There's men's clothes,

22:34.026 --> 22:35.921
and toiletries mixed up in here.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.008
And two tickets on the
late train to Phoenix

22:38.009 --> 22:39.136
for the night she died.

22:39.137 --> 22:40.254
She was looking to
get out of town,

22:40.255 --> 22:41.545
but she wasn't going alone.

22:41.546 --> 22:44.010
No names, so who was
going with her?

22:44.035 --> 22:45.334
Her mystery man.

22:45.515 --> 22:47.314
Her roommate said that
she was dating someone,

22:47.315 --> 22:49.406
someone who had some
stuff to work out.

22:49.407 --> 22:51.434
And Carver kept hassling
her to betray the Lees.

22:51.435 --> 22:53.502
Maybe they figured it was just
smarter to get out of town.

22:53.564 --> 22:54.878
But why Phoenix?

22:54.996 --> 22:57.850
Maybe a drier climate.
It's an asthma inhaler.

22:57.851 --> 22:59.258
But according to the
autopsy report,

22:59.259 --> 23:01.523
Jane didn't have asthma, so it
must have belonged to the guy.

23:01.524 --> 23:04.036
No prescription sticker,
but there's a bar code.

23:04.037 --> 23:05.121
Yeah, I'm gonna call
the manufacturer

23:05.122 --> 23:06.017
and have 'em trace it.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.770
Oh, and in case her
traveling companion

23:07.771 --> 23:08.744
was waiting outside for her,

23:08.745 --> 23:10.352
I pulled video from the
bank security cameras

23:10.353 --> 23:12.068
next door to the Mailbox Center.

23:12.994 --> 23:14.604
Okay, stop. There's Jane.

23:15.554 --> 23:16.401
And who's that with her?

23:16.402 --> 23:17.977
Finn McQueen, Jane's
ex-boyfriend.

23:17.978 --> 23:19.857
But he told us he hasn't
talked to Jane in weeks.

23:19.858 --> 23:21.449
Jane was leaving town with Finn?

23:21.450 --> 23:23.297
Nah. He's too tall for
the clothes in that bag.

23:23.298 --> 23:24.859
- It's not him.
- Yeah.

23:25.417 --> 23:26.216
Whoa.

23:26.217 --> 23:28.379
Looks like he's trying to
talk her out of going.

23:30.754 --> 23:32.171
What's that in his jacket?

23:35.146 --> 23:36.412
That would be a weapon.

23:36.674 --> 23:38.060
Looks like a Glock.

23:39.602 --> 23:41.520
CSU found it under your mattress.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.403
Where'd you get the gun, Finn?

23:44.289 --> 23:46.135
I notice the serial numbers
have been filed off.

23:46.136 --> 23:47.456
And that's the same
type of weapon

23:47.457 --> 23:49.002
that was used to kill Jane.

23:49.040 --> 23:50.498
That is not mine.

23:50.832 --> 23:53.839
And your guy confirmed my alibi.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.782
Alibis can be bought.

23:55.783 --> 23:58.377
Video... doesn't lie.

23:59.152 --> 24:00.976
You knew that Jane
was leaving town,

24:00.977 --> 24:04.338
and you knew she was in love
with someone else, didn't you?

24:14.171 --> 24:15.781
- He keeps saying he didn't do it, but that's...
- Beckett.

24:15.782 --> 24:17.760
- a man with a guilty conscience.
- Beckett.

24:18.574 --> 24:20.348
- We got word from ballistics.
- No match.

24:20.349 --> 24:22.583
The gun's a Glock 17,
but it's not mine.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.466
Detective Esposito. Gotcha.

24:25.467 --> 24:26.479
I know who the killer is.

24:26.480 --> 24:28.201
Thanks for getting back to me.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.759
Castle, we just got
some bad news,

24:30.760 --> 24:32.302
so no hypotheticals.

24:32.303 --> 24:33.198
Just give us a name.

24:33.199 --> 24:35.122
- Well, I have to start at the beginning--
- Name.

24:36.236 --> 24:37.694
Jinhai Li Chang.

24:39.436 --> 24:40.443
Okay, start from the beginning.

24:40.444 --> 24:42.162
Thank you.
So I realized last night,

24:42.163 --> 24:45.506
3XK would never give a
cop's gun to a friend.

24:45.507 --> 24:48.163
A-a gun that hot would be
a curse, not a blessing.

24:48.164 --> 24:49.331
But he would give it to an enemy.

24:49.332 --> 24:52.097
- So?
- So I went over all the incident reports

24:52.098 --> 24:54.584
involving Jerry Tyson during
his four years at Sing Sing,

24:54.585 --> 24:57.248
and one report in
particular stood out.

24:57.249 --> 24:59.200
Tyson got into it with a
guy in the weight yard,

24:59.201 --> 25:01.000
and he ended up in the
infirmary with a broken jaw.

25:01.001 --> 25:03.603
The jawbreaker's name--
Jinhai Li Chang.

25:03.929 --> 25:05.204
Look familiar?

25:05.730 --> 25:07.377
That's Philip, Clifford
Lee's oldest son.

25:07.378 --> 25:10.024
Apparently papa Clifford
anglicized the family's names

25:10.025 --> 25:11.561
when they moved into the country,

25:11.562 --> 25:13.192
but he never bothered
to make them legal.

25:13.193 --> 25:14.577
That's why it took me
so long to find it.

25:14.578 --> 25:17.185
When Philip got his
weapons charge in 2008,

25:17.186 --> 25:19.393
he was booked under
his Chinese name.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.609
But if Philip and Tyson
were sworn enemies,

25:21.610 --> 25:23.553
why would Philip accept the gun?

25:23.554 --> 25:25.320
The two eventually
became friends.

25:25.321 --> 25:26.152
It happens.

25:26.153 --> 25:27.875
Not with Jerry Tyson.

25:27.876 --> 25:29.962
That guy doesn't have any friends.
He's a psychopath.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.057
He wanted payback, and
he was willing to wait.

25:32.058 --> 25:34.197
Tyson sold Philip my
gun hoping he'd use it

25:34.198 --> 25:35.394
in the future.

25:35.454 --> 25:37.381
And then when Philip found out
that Jane was an informant,

25:37.382 --> 25:38.717
he did just that.

25:38.718 --> 25:40.669
Actually, Philip's motive

25:40.670 --> 25:42.421
may have been a little
more personal than that.

25:42.422 --> 25:44.716
The bar code on the inhaler
that we found in Jane's bag?

25:44.717 --> 25:47.460
That inhaler was issued
to one Ling Mai Chang,

25:47.461 --> 25:49.119
better known as Ben Lee.

25:49.141 --> 25:51.076
Jane was leaving town with Ben.

25:51.077 --> 25:53.655
So student and tutor become
boyfriend and girlfriend.

25:53.656 --> 25:55.149
They were in love.
It's "Romeo and Juliet."

25:55.150 --> 25:57.189
Well, Jane did have a thing
for reforming bad boys.

25:57.190 --> 25:58.979
Yeah, but Asian gangs--
you're in for life.

25:58.980 --> 26:00.318
There's no walking away.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.099
So like Romeo and Juliet,

26:02.100 --> 26:03.636
someone ended up dead.

26:03.637 --> 26:05.395
Brother Philip found
out about their plans

26:05.396 --> 26:06.458
to go to Phoenix together,

26:06.459 --> 26:08.986
so he murdered Jane to keep
little brother in the fold.

26:08.987 --> 26:11.295
Yeah, it's a great theory, guys.

26:11.296 --> 26:12.886
There's just one thing missing.

26:12.887 --> 26:14.425
Evidence, eyewitness accounts--

26:14.426 --> 26:16.641
something to make
this case stick.

26:17.679 --> 26:19.867
I know someone that
can help us out.

26:27.849 --> 26:29.257
You here to let me out?

26:29.391 --> 26:31.025
Not to let you out, Finn.

26:31.224 --> 26:32.577
To set you free.

26:33.734 --> 26:35.096
You cops, man.

26:35.574 --> 26:37.862
What's that supposed
to mean, set me free?

26:37.863 --> 26:39.497
The truth, Finn.

26:39.922 --> 26:41.497
The truth sets you free.

26:42.455 --> 26:44.257
I've been looking
for it all night.

26:45.743 --> 26:47.202
I finally found it.

26:48.551 --> 26:50.549
Who knew the truth would be
hiding in a juvie report

26:50.550 --> 26:52.212
from 1996?

26:52.213 --> 26:54.220
You got grabbed up moving paper

26:54.221 --> 26:55.679
for a Chinatown bookie.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.953
Do you remember who
bailed you out?

26:58.144 --> 26:59.096
Hmm?

26:59.655 --> 27:00.899
Clifford Lee.

27:02.039 --> 27:04.206
You been working for
the Lees for years.

27:04.207 --> 27:07.087
Little jobs, because, well,
Finn, let's face it,

27:07.088 --> 27:08.782
you're kind of a screwup.

27:08.783 --> 27:10.393
But you wanted more.

27:11.152 --> 27:13.406
So when you found out
Ben Lee needed a tutor,

27:13.407 --> 27:15.385
you recommended your ex...

27:16.247 --> 27:17.369
Jane...

27:18.463 --> 27:21.119
thinking it would earn you
points with the family.

27:22.523 --> 27:24.322
Then you watched
it all go sideways

27:24.323 --> 27:27.230
when Jane and Ben fell in love,

27:27.317 --> 27:28.650
decided to leave town.

27:28.651 --> 27:29.893
You thought...

27:30.540 --> 27:32.605
what if the family blamed you?

27:32.891 --> 27:34.730
'Cause no one leaves
the family business,

27:34.731 --> 27:36.045
not even for love.

27:36.379 --> 27:38.925
So you tried to make
her change her mind.

27:40.891 --> 27:42.058
You fought.

27:42.059 --> 27:43.981
But you couldn't change her mind.

27:44.435 --> 27:46.498
So you made a call to Philip,

27:46.499 --> 27:49.301
and then Philip
went and got Jane.

27:52.155 --> 27:53.637
Remember this, Finn?

27:54.675 --> 27:56.045
I talked to her mother.

27:56.691 --> 27:58.514
She says you gave
this cross to Jane

27:58.515 --> 28:00.381
on her 21st birthday.

28:00.724 --> 28:03.174
She was holding it
when she died...

28:03.932 --> 28:05.134
for comfort.

28:07.420 --> 28:09.357
Because she knew
she was gonna die.

28:10.701 --> 28:12.637
And she was so...

28:13.187 --> 28:14.486
afraid.

28:18.723 --> 28:20.413
Let me make sure I
got this straight.

28:20.427 --> 28:22.738
Finn McQueen claims that
he phoned my client

28:22.739 --> 28:23.770
and told him that his brother Ben

28:23.771 --> 28:25.777
was leaving town
with Jane Herzfeld,

28:25.778 --> 28:28.685
to which my client
allegedly replied,

28:28.908 --> 28:30.317
"I'll take care of it."

28:30.659 --> 28:32.029
Is that all you've got?

28:32.091 --> 28:33.514
We've already
established that Philip

28:33.515 --> 28:35.261
was at home with his family
when the girl was shot.

28:35.262 --> 28:38.619
Well, then why was his cell
phone on West 12th Street?

28:38.620 --> 28:40.130
Your client made a phone call

28:40.131 --> 28:42.282
to his parents'
house at 11:30 P.M.

28:42.283 --> 28:45.026
That call pinged off a tower
off the West Side Highway,

28:45.027 --> 28:46.914
which is a couple of blocks
from our murder scene.

28:46.915 --> 28:48.130
Were you calling your father,

28:48.131 --> 28:49.266
letting him know
the job was done?

28:49.267 --> 28:50.913
Please, detective.
His phone pinged?

28:50.914 --> 28:52.455
You know that's not enough
to charge him with murder.

28:52.456 --> 28:53.799
Not yet, but give me some time.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.760
Listen, if your client
wants to talk deal--

28:55.761 --> 28:56.890
Dream on.

28:56.891 --> 28:57.983
Let's go, Philip.

29:03.997 --> 29:06.124
You killed that girl, and you
used my weapon to do it,

29:06.125 --> 29:07.863
and now I carry that weight.

29:08.013 --> 29:10.060
Trust me when I say to
you that I will not rest

29:10.061 --> 29:12.095
until I make you carry it, too.

29:12.413 --> 29:13.126
Hey!

29:13.127 --> 29:14.124
We're done here.

29:14.125 --> 29:16.428
And if you attempt to contact
my client or his family again

29:16.429 --> 29:18.623
without first
notifying my office,

29:18.710 --> 29:20.421
we'll sue the department
for harassment.

29:20.422 --> 29:22.059
All right. Okay.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.106
We got it.

29:27.973 --> 29:28.996
This is the second time

29:28.997 --> 29:30.660
you've gone at the
Lees with nothing.

29:30.661 --> 29:32.788
Now Philip Lee has lawyered up,

29:32.789 --> 29:34.524
he's probably gotten
rid of the gun,

29:34.525 --> 29:37.420
and he has four family members
and various household help

29:37.421 --> 29:39.572
willing to alibi him for
the time of the murder.

29:39.573 --> 29:41.372
The cell phone puts
him in the vicinity

29:41.373 --> 29:43.060
- of the murder scene.
- Vicinity?

29:43.061 --> 29:43.852
Finn McQueen said--

29:43.853 --> 29:46.589
Finn McQueen cannot testify
to what happened, Castle.

29:46.590 --> 29:48.126
He wasn't there.

29:49.796 --> 29:51.063
Make your case.

29:51.165 --> 29:52.124
But you do it now,

29:52.125 --> 29:53.532
without harassing the Lee family.

29:53.533 --> 29:55.612
Sir, we need to keep
leaning on them.

29:55.613 --> 29:56.916
We need to keep the heat on.

29:56.917 --> 29:59.876
No. You need to stay away,
and that's an order.

29:59.877 --> 30:02.372
So what, we just write the
name of Jane's killer

30:02.373 --> 30:03.860
in a file and we
let him walk free?

30:03.861 --> 30:05.800
That makes us clerks, not cops.

30:08.565 --> 30:10.951
Take the rest of
the day off, Ryan.

30:11.703 --> 30:13.288
You need to clear your head.

30:21.967 --> 30:23.131
It's not over yet, bro.

30:23.132 --> 30:24.764
We just need someone
to go on record,

30:24.765 --> 30:26.647
someone who knows what
happened that night.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.942
Yeah. The only one who
really knows is Philip Lee.

30:28.943 --> 30:30.041
Mm-hmm.

30:35.487 --> 30:36.585
Where you going?

30:37.624 --> 30:39.087
I'm gonna do just like
the captain said,

30:39.088 --> 30:40.570
take the rest of the day off.

30:47.358 --> 30:48.369
Hey.

30:48.735 --> 30:50.182
Wherever you're going,
I'm going with you.

30:50.183 --> 30:50.990
It's my fight.

30:50.991 --> 30:52.942
And you don't want
me getting involved.

30:52.943 --> 30:54.281
It's my case, too.

30:56.975 --> 30:58.187
And you're my partner.

31:00.448 --> 31:02.297
I'm taking a run at Ben Lee.

31:04.399 --> 31:06.001
The Lees will have
him locked down.

31:06.375 --> 31:08.786
I'm betting his old man won't
let him go out in public alone.

31:10.711 --> 31:11.817
Then...

31:11.839 --> 31:13.985
I guess we can't go in
there looking like cops.

31:29.177 --> 31:30.375
Oh, snap.

31:30.376 --> 31:32.600
Is that Philip?
Yo, what's good, son?

31:32.601 --> 31:34.342
Man, I ain't seen you in a minute.
Man, how you been?

31:34.343 --> 31:36.934
He thinks I'm my brother.
Happens with the gweilo.

31:36.935 --> 31:38.542
- What's up?
- Move along.

31:38.543 --> 31:39.767
Hey, man, why you
touching up on me?

31:39.768 --> 31:41.038
Hey, man, you better
check your totem.

31:41.039 --> 31:42.458
Hey, Philip, tell
him that we boys.

31:42.459 --> 31:43.366
Tell your boy Thor

31:43.367 --> 31:45.150
- that we boys.
- Yeah, let's go outside.

31:45.151 --> 31:46.454
You can call Philip
on his cell later.

31:46.455 --> 31:47.230
Philip, tell him!

31:47.231 --> 31:48.905
Man, you've changed, Philip.

31:54.183 --> 31:55.058
Hey, Ben.

31:55.231 --> 31:56.206
You shouldn't be here.

31:56.207 --> 31:57.509
I just want to talk.

31:57.510 --> 31:58.568
About what?

31:59.159 --> 32:00.209
About Jane.

32:01.647 --> 32:03.057
Jane is dead.

32:05.823 --> 32:07.641
So you let it all
just die with her?

32:08.200 --> 32:09.338
What happened, huh?

32:09.623 --> 32:10.799
College maybe got you thinking

32:10.800 --> 32:12.309
that there's something
better out there

32:12.310 --> 32:14.329
than being just a
low-life drug dealer?

32:14.431 --> 32:16.153
Jane made you really want to try?

32:20.783 --> 32:22.185
You can still get out.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.290
And I promise, you'll be safe.

32:24.872 --> 32:26.862
You cops and your promises, man.

32:26.863 --> 32:28.321
Carver promised
Jane she'd be safe.

32:28.322 --> 32:29.641
Look what happened.

32:36.583 --> 32:38.049
You're talking about my family.

32:38.353 --> 32:40.985
I'm talking about your life.

32:41.928 --> 32:44.137
Jane died fighting your battle.

32:44.983 --> 32:47.177
I know you can honor
her better than this.

32:48.719 --> 32:50.593
Ben, you okay?

32:55.275 --> 32:56.765
You know how to find me.

33:03.628 --> 33:05.291
What the hell were
you two thinking,

33:05.292 --> 33:08.778
going to see Ben Lee when Gates
specifically said "stay away"?

33:08.779 --> 33:10.738
Who's gonna tell her, Beckett?
Not me.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.834
Ryan, are you planning on telling
the captain what we did?

33:12.835 --> 33:13.994
Not me. Castle?

33:13.995 --> 33:15.367
Who me? No way.

33:15.403 --> 33:16.583
Nice, smart-ass. And what about

33:16.584 --> 33:19.406
and Gates gets a phone
call from their lawyer?

33:19.407 --> 33:20.798
You two are gonna get benched.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.150
Ben Lee's not gonna
tell his father.

33:22.151 --> 33:23.758
- How do you know?
- Because...

33:23.759 --> 33:25.710
I looked him in the eye and
I saw the pain he's in.

33:25.711 --> 33:27.518
Maybe he's not man enough
to stand up for himself,

33:27.519 --> 33:29.337
but he's not gonna
rat me out, either.

33:32.519 --> 33:34.570
You guys took a hell of a chance.

33:35.520 --> 33:37.722
Beckett, you're starting
to sound like a boss.

33:38.143 --> 33:39.528
Just let me know next
time so I can help--

33:39.529 --> 33:41.028
Detective Ryan.

33:42.096 --> 33:43.805
There's someone here to see you.

34:17.813 --> 34:19.277
Papa said you were down here.

34:20.027 --> 34:22.141
Ah, you're a senior now.
You don't need to work this hard.

34:22.636 --> 34:24.245
I have a test on Monday.

34:24.505 --> 34:26.451
Blow it off. We'll go out.

34:26.889 --> 34:28.051
I don't want to go.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.914
Philip.

34:38.553 --> 34:41.163
If they hadn't found Jane,
if she'd stayed hidden...

34:41.360 --> 34:43.531
I never would've known
what happened to her.

34:47.313 --> 34:48.480
Would you really
have let me wonder

34:48.481 --> 34:50.147
for the rest of my life?

34:52.625 --> 34:54.808
Sometimes it's a gift,
not knowing the truth.

34:54.809 --> 34:56.992
So if she were just missing,
I could believe that

34:56.993 --> 34:58.412
she were alive somewhere?

34:58.841 --> 35:00.067
I could pretend...

35:00.521 --> 35:01.735
like a child?

35:03.933 --> 35:05.631
But she's not missing!

35:06.894 --> 35:07.781
I don't like this.

35:07.782 --> 35:10.694
Ben is supposed to lead
Philip to a confession

35:10.695 --> 35:12.310
you guys, just give him a minute.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.457
She's dead,

35:13.775 --> 35:15.405
and I'm not a child.

35:15.603 --> 35:19.062
In time, you'll see,
it was for the best...

35:19.322 --> 35:20.542
Philip's dancing around it.

35:20.543 --> 35:21.990
Look, the second he
acknowledges guilt,

35:21.991 --> 35:22.790
we're moving in.

35:22.791 --> 35:24.271
Come on. Come on.

35:24.272 --> 35:25.662
Did she cry? Did she ask for me?

35:25.663 --> 35:27.150
Ben...

35:27.663 --> 35:28.688
Don't do this.

35:28.689 --> 35:29.801
I need to know.

35:32.647 --> 35:33.503
You're not thinking clearly.

35:33.504 --> 35:35.081
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

35:35.392 --> 35:38.137
If you don't tell me everything,
we can no longer be brothers.

35:52.367 --> 35:53.672
You wearing a wire?

35:54.127 --> 35:55.126
Ryan, he's tipping.

35:55.127 --> 35:56.270
Maybe Ben can turn it around.

35:56.271 --> 35:57.422
No, we have to pull him out now.

35:57.423 --> 35:58.414
Just...

35:58.415 --> 35:59.825
Wire. What is this?

36:00.159 --> 36:02.969
Let me see. Open your shirt.

36:02.970 --> 36:04.745
- I don't need to prove anything to you.
- Ben!

36:10.935 --> 36:12.721
This is your last
chance, little brother.

36:14.169 --> 36:15.324
Show me.

36:15.325 --> 36:16.575
Let's go. Let's move.

36:17.374 --> 36:18.799
You gonna shoot me now,

36:19.046 --> 36:20.279
like you did Jane?

36:20.597 --> 36:21.655
Don't push me.

36:22.903 --> 36:23.935
Go to hell.

36:24.281 --> 36:25.185
Get 'em up!

36:25.186 --> 36:26.345
Down!

36:26.346 --> 36:28.299
Traitor! Traitor.

36:37.355 --> 36:38.517
Nei jian!

36:39.515 --> 36:40.386
Nei jian!

36:40.387 --> 36:41.576
You ruined my life!

36:41.577 --> 36:42.490
No, Ben!

36:42.491 --> 36:43.929
No, no!

36:43.930 --> 36:45.728
Ben, put down the gun!

36:45.729 --> 36:47.075
No! Don't!

36:47.993 --> 36:49.241
No, Ben!

36:49.242 --> 36:50.267
No!

36:50.723 --> 36:52.077
Ben! No!

36:52.859 --> 36:54.883
Get him outta here!
Ben! Oh, God, Ben!

36:55.035 --> 36:56.048
Ben! Ben!

36:56.049 --> 36:58.606
Call it in. Rush the bus?

36:58.626 --> 37:00.067
They're on the way.

37:01.705 --> 37:02.971
Ben!

37:05.070 --> 37:07.644
I'm so sorry. Damn it.
I am so sorry.

37:07.645 --> 37:08.881
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

37:08.882 --> 37:11.089
There's enough on a
tape to sway a jury

37:11.090 --> 37:12.792
from reasonable doubt.

37:12.793 --> 37:14.327
And the coke that we
found in your car

37:14.328 --> 37:16.503
is a match for the residue
found on Jane's body.

37:16.504 --> 37:17.459
And then...

37:17.777 --> 37:19.485
there's this.

37:22.027 --> 37:24.677
The gun that you pointed
at your brother.

37:25.418 --> 37:27.602
Detective Ryan
positively identified it

37:27.603 --> 37:29.218
as his stolen service weapon.

37:29.219 --> 37:30.834
It is also the same gun

37:30.835 --> 37:32.997
that was used to
kill Jane Herzfeld.

37:34.123 --> 37:35.395
You're looking at murder one,

37:35.396 --> 37:36.972
life with no parole.

37:41.147 --> 37:44.285
My client has some information
that might interest the NYPD.

37:44.483 --> 37:45.949
What kind of information?

37:47.107 --> 37:48.413
Jerry Tyson...

37:49.251 --> 37:50.517
3XK.

37:51.956 --> 37:53.111
What about him?

37:54.306 --> 37:56.148
When he gave me the
gun, we talked.

37:56.683 --> 37:58.348
I know where he was headed,

37:58.643 --> 38:00.554
and what name he's gonna use.

38:04.947 --> 38:07.265
So Lee wants 15 to 25

38:07.266 --> 38:10.106
with parole in ten for
giving us Tyson's new alias.

38:10.107 --> 38:11.918
And I need to give the ADA

38:11.919 --> 38:13.317
a recommendation.

38:14.371 --> 38:16.901
This might be our chance
to get 3XK, Castle.

38:17.739 --> 38:18.861
No.

38:19.554 --> 38:20.669
It's a setup.

38:21.146 --> 38:22.849
Jerry Tyson gave that
gun to Philip Lee

38:22.850 --> 38:23.996
knowing he would use it,

38:23.997 --> 38:24.951
so there's a good chance he knew

38:24.952 --> 38:26.674
we'd eventually get to Philip.

38:26.976 --> 38:28.096
Maybe. So what?

38:28.097 --> 38:30.618
So nothing Tyson told
Philip would be the truth.

38:32.041 --> 38:34.303
Giving Philip Lee a good
deal for bad information?

38:34.304 --> 38:36.340
That's just another
win for Jerry Tyson.

38:36.756 --> 38:37.744
Are you sure?

38:37.745 --> 38:38.899
Sure enough.

38:40.530 --> 38:42.459
Jane Herzfeld deserves justice--

38:42.977 --> 38:45.339
life in prison for Philip Lee.
No deals.

38:47.818 --> 38:49.819
We'll get 3XK

38:50.273 --> 38:51.579
and we'll do it right.

38:54.409 --> 38:55.711
Damn, Castle.

38:55.712 --> 38:57.786
Look at you, thinking
like a real cop.

39:05.388 --> 39:06.567
Hey, guys.

39:07.623 --> 39:09.774
Hey. You could look
a little happier.

39:09.775 --> 39:11.337
Today was a win, right?

39:12.383 --> 39:15.320
Well, I keep thinking
about Seth Carver,

39:16.145 --> 39:18.310
sending Jane into the
Lees', all alone,

39:18.311 --> 39:19.649
with no backup.

39:21.246 --> 39:24.186
Do I really get to call
myself a better cop?

39:24.231 --> 39:25.945
You are a better cop, Kevin.

39:26.423 --> 39:27.857
You're a better man,

39:28.303 --> 39:30.326
because you didn't send
him in there alone.

39:33.756 --> 39:35.054
Hey, there's your boy.

39:36.660 --> 39:39.063
Ben... good to see you
back on your feet.

39:39.124 --> 39:40.877
Hey, that was a pretty impressive
performance back there.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.901
Yes, you have a future in
stunt work, my friend.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.365
Guys, this is marshal Mike Drooen

39:44.366 --> 39:45.510
from Witness Protection.

39:45.511 --> 39:47.805
He's escorting Ben to his
new home in Los Angeles.

39:47.806 --> 39:50.792
Detectives.
Ben, your plane leaves in an hour.

39:50.839 --> 39:52.874
Thanks. I just need a minute.

39:59.622 --> 40:00.648
Thank you.

40:00.846 --> 40:03.202
I wouldn't have had the courage
to do what I did without you.

40:04.286 --> 40:06.144
Well, you have your
life back now.

40:07.175 --> 40:08.657
Live it on your own terms.

40:11.166 --> 40:12.488
It's what she wanted.

40:28.054 --> 40:29.112
Oh.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.916
Let's, uh, keep this party a
little quiet, though, all right?

40:33.115 --> 40:34.971
If the captain hears, I'm
sure she'll blame me.

40:34.972 --> 40:36.681
Who's gonna tell her?
Not me. You?

40:36.682 --> 40:38.329
- Nope.
- What about you, Ryan?

40:38.330 --> 40:38.921
Mnh-mnh.

40:38.922 --> 40:40.436
Well, then I think we're good.

40:40.514 --> 40:43.084
Well, then... to my partner--

40:43.098 --> 40:44.181
Kevin Ryan--

40:44.506 --> 40:45.837
a credit to the job.

40:46.027 --> 40:46.675
To Ryan.

40:46.676 --> 40:48.144
To Ryan.

40:50.295 --> 40:51.662
I'd like to make a toast.

40:55.805 --> 40:57.063
To bravery...

40:57.732 --> 40:59.126
And commitment...

40:59.644 --> 41:01.582
To love and sacrifice...

41:03.813 --> 41:04.887
To Jane.

41:05.357 --> 41:06.423
To Jane.

41:07.789 --> 41:11.781
