02:06.720 --> 02:07.820
I apologize, we're late.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.180
I got Asher to come say
goodbye to Teacher.

Aw, this little guy didn't
qualify for tomorrow's ceremony.

03:55.080 --> 03:57.580
[FATHER] He's just not strong enough
to be assigned to a family yet.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.940
[CRYING]

03:59.040 --> 04:01.060
He looks so unhappy.

- Hey...

04:04.520 --> 04:06.590
It's okay, Jonas, you can open it.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.700

[BABY QUIETING]

- [WHISPERING] It's okay.
- Some people have it, huh?

04:20.120 --> 04:21.260
Well, that's just not fair.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.021
Be strong, Gabriel.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.180
You looked at his name?

04:25.280 --> 04:26.660
Isn't that against the rules?

04:26.760 --> 04:28.500
Yeah, it, it is.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.783
I just thought having a
name might help him grow.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.543
So I whisper it to him
when no one can hear.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.305
Sometimes I call him Gabe.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.780
[FATHER]
But he's usually so restless,

04:39.880 --> 04:42.109
I, I'm not even sure he can hear me.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.420
You okay?

04:43.520 --> 04:45.100
Huh? Yeah.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.180
I'm fine.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.820
So the old man turns
to the Elder and says,

04:47.920 --> 04:49.220
"Do you know who I am?"

04:49.320 --> 04:51.340
And the Elder says,
"Sir, I know you're old,

04:51.440 --> 04:53.100
but that is no excuse
for being prideful."

04:53.200 --> 04:56.020
And then the old man says,
"No, really, I'm asking.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.660
- Who am I?"
- [JONAS AND ASHER LAUGHING]

04:58.760 --> 05:00.460
[FIONA] I don't get it.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.860
[ASHER] "Who am I?" like,
like he forgot who he was.

05:02.960 --> 05:03.940
[ELECTRONIC CHIMING]

05:04.040 --> 05:05.420
Okay, but wouldn't the joke be better

05:05.520 --> 05:07.620
- if the old man says...
- [ASHER AND JONAS] Okay, one...

05:07.720 --> 05:09.300
- What?
- ...two...

The last night of our childhood.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.900
I guess everything is
gonna be different.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.980
No.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.860
Tomorrow the only thing
that changes is what we do.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.460
It doesn't change who we are.

Quick question: Who are we?

05:36.960 --> 05:37.940
Friends.

[MOTHER] I feel...

disappointment.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.820
What was the Elders' decision?

06:04.920 --> 06:06.180
Released to Elsewhere.
