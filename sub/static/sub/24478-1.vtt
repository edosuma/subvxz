WEBVTT

00:09.310 --> 00:11.068
You are descendants
of Kings and Queens,

00:11.206 --> 00:13.931
walk proud, walk proud,
heads up!

00:14.413 --> 00:16.137
Brothers and sisters,
you are free citizens!

00:16.275 --> 00:18.827
Stay woke, don't jump
to these unjust laws!

00:18.965 --> 00:20.689
I fought for freedom
and your nose are

00:20.827 --> 00:22.000
in these phones and gadgets!

00:22.137 --> 00:24.620
Your minds are enslaved again!

00:24.758 --> 00:27.379
Put in on a t-shirt
and be woke upstairs, now!

00:28.103 --> 00:29.482
Beautiful black woman,

00:29.620 --> 00:31.724
you are descendants
of Kings and Queens.

00:31.862 --> 00:34.931
Walk proud, head up,
my black and brown brothers,

00:35.068 --> 00:36.793
The justice system
is a new Jim Crow,

00:36.931 --> 00:39.655
the new slavery,
you gotta fight it!

00:46.241 --> 00:47.896
- Morning, Akin.
- Morning.

00:51.896 --> 00:53.000
Thank you.

00:53.758 --> 00:55.103
I'm gonna need
another one of these.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.137
Starting a trial?

00:57.275 --> 00:58.655
Yeah, have you heard anything?
Is Hammond ready to go?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Well, he told Dashay that
he was ready for something,

01:01.137 --> 01:02.448
I dunno if it's yours, but...

01:02.586 --> 01:03.689
You are my hero.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.068
Don't worry,
I'll put it on your tab.

01:05.206 --> 01:06.068
Thank you.

01:10.206 --> 01:12.344
Jamal, part F, 30 minutes.

01:23.655 --> 01:25.034
God,
I hope that coffee's for me.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.448
Black and sweet,
just like you like it,

01:26.586 --> 01:27.965
- you want a chip?
- Na.

01:28.206 --> 01:29.344
Come on,
it's like bacon in a bag.

01:29.482 --> 01:31.344
Mmm, I brought up
your guys first.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.344
Thank God,
I got four cases of F4

01:33.482 --> 01:35.137
and it looks like
my attempted rape is gonna go.

01:35.793 --> 01:38.137
Adler's in a mood, he already
started calling cases.

01:38.275 --> 01:40.137
People vs. Franklin Cowling,

01:40.275 --> 01:43.000
Obstructing Governmental
Administration, step up!

01:43.137 --> 01:44.724
Counsel, state your name
for the record.

01:45.034 --> 01:46.620
Gwen Sullivan,
Defenders Association

01:46.758 --> 01:48.344
of New York County
for Mr. Cowling.

01:48.482 --> 01:49.793
Your Honor,
the people have a one time

01:49.931 --> 01:51.586
only offer of six months.

01:51.758 --> 01:54.206
Sounds eminently fair,
what say you, Miss Sullivan?

01:54.344 --> 01:56.379
I say I need 15 minutes
to talk to my client.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.137
No need to discuss,
discourse, dialogue!

01:59.275 --> 02:00.448
Are you off your meds?

02:00.655 --> 02:02.103
I ain't messing with them meds,

02:02.241 --> 02:03.965
that's the government
trying to control me.

02:04.103 --> 02:06.379
OK, Your Honor,
don't you think a second call

02:06.517 --> 02:07.517
would be useful here?

02:07.655 --> 02:09.379
Is your client 7-30, counselor?

02:09.517 --> 02:12.310
- Well, no, but you can--
- Six months, yes or no?

02:12.620 --> 02:15.206
This court suppresses,
represses and depresses

02:15.344 --> 02:17.310
the body and integrity
of the black man.

02:17.448 --> 02:20.586
Stick a fork in it,
we're done! I'm revoking bail.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.172
Wait, what? Your Honor,
we didn't--

02:22.310 --> 02:24.551
Your client was late!
Put it over till tomorrow.

02:24.689 --> 02:26.172
He.. He's locking me up?

02:26.310 --> 02:28.103
- Yes, but don't-- No.
- You in on this, ain't you?

02:29.344 --> 02:31.896
Franklin!
Franklin, it's me!

02:32.310 --> 02:33.655
Don't grab him, don't grab him,

02:33.793 --> 02:35.068
he doesn't like
getting grabbed like this.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.931
Get off of him, he doesn't like
being restrained.

02:40.896 --> 02:42.482
Damn,
I know you said you boxed

02:42.620 --> 02:43.758
but you went in
like Mayweather!

02:43.896 --> 02:45.137
In light
of what just happened--

02:45.275 --> 02:47.965
Your Honor,
we'll take the six months.

03:20.793 --> 03:21.931
Hey.

03:23.965 --> 03:26.413
So, what's your story?
Are you moving packs?

03:26.931 --> 03:28.620
You left a Louis
bag from Bernies.

03:28.758 --> 03:31.586
Yo, I got two videos
up on Worldstar,

03:32.137 --> 03:33.689
do you wanna be my third?

03:37.068 --> 03:38.344
Alright.

03:40.793 --> 03:42.241
Hilary Banks.

03:44.862 --> 03:46.310
That's your boss, right there.

03:50.620 --> 03:53.137
Hi, Vanessa Hastings.

03:54.551 --> 03:56.758
Tom DelGato, attorney in chief.

03:59.793 --> 04:01.620
- Morning, Lisa.
- Morning, Tom.

04:07.137 --> 04:08.379
It's ten o'clock.

04:09.068 --> 04:11.103
What happened to your
only at lunchtime rule?

04:11.551 --> 04:13.620
Rules are made
to be broken, honey.

04:13.931 --> 04:15.000
Are they?

04:15.206 --> 04:17.034
So, we can do
an actual dinner, too?

04:18.379 --> 04:21.172
Let's keep it at one work day
screw for now, Richard.

04:21.586 --> 04:23.586
Why, when they're so much fun?

04:23.758 --> 04:27.931
'Cause you're a married man
and I'm a traditional girl...

04:30.448 --> 04:32.379
With traditional values.

04:32.517 --> 04:33.586
Ah.

04:47.034 --> 04:49.620
Jesus, you're like
a pit-bull in pumps!

04:50.413 --> 04:51.758
We had bets at the office,
you know,

04:51.896 --> 04:53.206
where you'd come after me.

04:53.344 --> 04:54.827
I don't think anyone picked
the men room.

04:54.965 --> 04:57.000
Well, we're both lucky
your stall was locked.

04:58.379 --> 05:00.137
It was a bad ID,
you're gonna lose the hearing,

05:00.275 --> 05:02.379
come down off the sixth
and I'll get him to take it.

05:02.551 --> 05:03.724
You can have five.

05:03.862 --> 05:05.655
Uh-uh, that was too easy,
what's going on?

05:05.862 --> 05:07.586
Fine, you can have eight.

05:07.827 --> 05:09.379
Your case is falling apart,

05:09.517 --> 05:11.172
that's why you're being such
a tight ass with the Rosario.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.862
That case is air tight,
you've got, er...

05:14.000 --> 05:15.137
An hour to take the five,

05:15.275 --> 05:17.034
after that,
deal's off the table.

05:33.172 --> 05:34.517
- Hey, Andrew.
- Hey.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.793
The D.A. came down to five,

05:53.068 --> 05:54.517
with good time
you'll be out in four.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.068
See, I knew this was coming.

05:56.206 --> 05:57.724
You know I have your back

05:57.862 --> 05:59.724
but if you blow trial, it's not
five years, it's fifteen.

05:59.862 --> 06:01.655
I don't care if it's 50,
I ain't never touched that girl

06:01.793 --> 06:03.448
Brandell, a straight A
engineering student

06:03.586 --> 06:05.482
is gonna get up on that stand,
point at you and say,

06:05.620 --> 06:06.793
"I will never forget the face

06:06.931 --> 06:08.241
of the man
who tried to rape me."

06:08.379 --> 06:09.827
All I know is that
I went out for a run,

06:09.965 --> 06:11.344
next thing I know
I'm in the back of a cop car,

06:11.482 --> 06:12.655
chick I ain't never seen

06:12.793 --> 06:14.482
talking about
I tried to rape her.

06:14.620 --> 06:16.620
Nine months, I've been locked
down for something I didn't do.

06:16.827 --> 06:18.586
I lost my job, my wife,

06:18.793 --> 06:20.344
her and my kids
had to move back in

06:20.482 --> 06:21.931
with her momma in Atlanta.

06:22.379 --> 06:23.931
I ain't seen my little girls.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.965
- You had her locket.
- I told you, I found it!

06:28.103 --> 06:30.689
It's a bad fact, please don't
play like you don't know that.

06:31.241 --> 06:32.758
You know... What's funny?

06:32.896 --> 06:34.827
I actually
couldn't believe my luck.

06:34.965 --> 06:36.000
I thought
I could give that locket

06:36.137 --> 06:37.172
to my youngest daughter.

06:37.310 --> 06:38.724
Brandell,
you take the five years,

06:38.862 --> 06:40.068
your Tosh is in pre-school
by the time you get out.

06:40.206 --> 06:42.000
You blow trial,
she's in college.

06:43.482 --> 06:48.103
I didn't do this,
I'm not copping out... I can't.

06:56.137 --> 06:57.275
Then we fight.

07:08.655 --> 07:10.172
Ladies and gentleman,

07:10.310 --> 07:13.034
the police did a procedure
in this case called a Show Up.

07:13.413 --> 07:15.344
That's a line up,
a line up in the streets,

07:15.482 --> 07:20.172
a line up with only one choice,
my client, Brandell Willis.

07:20.586 --> 07:22.172
Had my client not been
running in the--

07:22.310 --> 07:23.689
Yo, Fight Club!

07:23.827 --> 07:25.000
Oh God, jeez.

07:25.137 --> 07:26.241
I heard someone
couldn't keep their hands

07:26.379 --> 07:27.620
off one of their clients today?

07:27.758 --> 07:29.172
Heard it ended
with you in handcuffs.

07:29.310 --> 07:30.241
- You jealous?
- Only 'cause I wasn't there.

07:30.379 --> 07:31.517
Turn around.

07:35.448 --> 07:36.758
Don't tell me the judge
is finally coming

07:36.896 --> 07:38.275
to watch you on trial.

07:38.413 --> 07:40.310
We're meeting for lunch
at the club.

07:41.034 --> 07:42.310
- Hmm.
- What?

07:42.448 --> 07:44.172
Just imagining
what it's gonna be like

07:44.310 --> 07:45.551
to have you call me boss.

07:45.724 --> 07:47.344
Cute, I call you
a lot of things, Charlie,

07:47.482 --> 07:49.275
trust me, boss ain't never
gonna be one of them.

07:49.413 --> 07:50.965
And anyway Tom would never
promote you over me.

07:51.103 --> 07:52.862
I don't know, only one
of us beat down

07:53.000 --> 07:54.482
- a court officer today.
- And the other one of us

07:54.620 --> 07:56.137
doesn't want to break a nail,
now get out.

07:56.275 --> 07:58.551
I promise not to enjoy
bossing you around at all.

07:58.689 --> 08:00.655
- Beat it, beat it.
- OK, I'm going.

08:03.655 --> 08:05.000
Yes, she wants me.

08:05.551 --> 08:06.758
There seems to be a mistake,

08:06.896 --> 08:08.172
I applied
for the civil division.

08:08.310 --> 08:09.586
Normal case load
for a new attorney

08:09.724 --> 08:11.172
is 125 misdemeanors.

08:11.310 --> 08:12.310
125?

08:12.448 --> 08:13.448
You gonna be able
to handle this

08:13.586 --> 08:14.827
without bitching and moaning?

08:14.965 --> 08:15.827
Because I hate
bitching and moaning,

08:15.965 --> 08:17.413
raises my blood pressure.

08:19.413 --> 08:20.551
Really?

08:27.310 --> 08:29.896
Well, hello,
young Condoleezza Rice.

08:30.517 --> 08:32.482
I'm Vanessa Hastings, I'm new.

08:33.758 --> 08:35.206
I gotta share
my office with a rookie?

08:35.344 --> 08:36.724
What did I say to you
a minute ago?

08:36.862 --> 08:38.275
You hate bitching and moaning.

08:38.413 --> 08:39.931
You see that,
she's only been here 15 minutes

08:40.068 --> 08:41.586
and I already like her
better than you.

08:42.206 --> 08:43.206
Who's my assistant?

08:43.344 --> 08:44.896
- Take that back.
- Tom!

08:45.034 --> 08:47.241
Not now, Charlie, I have to go
talk to Judge Adler,

08:47.379 --> 08:50.241
some idiot got handcuffed
in his courtroom this morning.

08:50.379 --> 08:52.137
You know, I heard she was
more heroic than idiotic.

08:52.275 --> 08:53.655
All I know is that,
because of you,

08:53.793 --> 08:55.206
I have to put on a tie.

08:55.344 --> 08:57.034
OK, listen, I got Hammond
to come down to five

08:57.172 --> 08:58.827
but I can't get
my guy to swallow it.

08:58.965 --> 09:00.310
Say you gotta go I.D.

09:00.448 --> 09:02.344
Oh God, I'm just hoping
the show up was bad.

09:02.482 --> 09:04.758
You're gonna roll the dice and
hope a defense reveals itself

09:04.896 --> 09:06.068
for the suppression hearing?

09:06.206 --> 09:07.862
Oh, please,
you know I always have

09:08.000 --> 09:09.310
something in my back pocket,
I just don't know what yet.

09:09.448 --> 09:10.931
- What judge you pull?
- Blackburn.

09:11.068 --> 09:12.931
- Shit, he needs to plead.
- My guy didn't do it.

09:13.068 --> 09:15.275
Didn't homeboy have the
victims locket in his pocket?

09:15.413 --> 09:16.724
Yeah, whatever, Dr. Seuss!

09:16.862 --> 09:18.517
Jesus, both of you, grow up!

09:18.931 --> 09:20.758
Charlie, take the rookie
over to arraignments.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.103
Tell her something encouraging
and keep an eye on her,

09:23.241 --> 09:24.655
she's a Caldwell fellow.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.448
What the hell is that?

09:26.655 --> 09:28.724
She's a first year associate
at Caldwell, Drummond and Hale.

09:28.862 --> 09:30.103
She does a year
of public service,

09:30.241 --> 09:32.586
they pay her
a full Caldwell salary.

09:32.724 --> 09:34.482
Guess we know
who's buying lunch.

09:35.517 --> 09:38.103
Yo, rookie, let's roll.

09:53.689 --> 09:56.413
Someone gets arrested,
they disappear into the system.

09:56.551 --> 09:59.413
On a good day, they pop up here
24 hours later

09:59.586 --> 10:01.172
and get assigned a lawyer.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.793
Oh, come on, Joel, give her
one day of community service,

10:03.931 --> 10:07.724
Haven't you ever stolen
the least itty bitty thing?

10:08.551 --> 10:09.413
Miss. Campbell.

10:10.172 --> 10:12.482
You're not taking advantage
of Mr. Maknimara are you?

10:12.620 --> 10:14.724
I take advantage of everyone,
Your Honor,

10:14.862 --> 10:17.137
but when I smile,
they don't seem to mind.

10:19.862 --> 10:22.241
Tracy, this is...
What's your name again?

10:22.379 --> 10:24.034
Vanessa Hastings,
it's nice to meet you.

10:24.344 --> 10:27.655
Docket ending 822,
The People vs. Julie Sulowitz.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.000
Penal Law 240.37.

10:30.206 --> 10:31.379
Loitering for the purposes

10:31.517 --> 10:34.034
of engaging
in prostitution, step up!

10:36.206 --> 10:37.517
Fun fact about Charlie,

10:37.655 --> 10:38.793
he once slept with
a 60 year old fat woman

10:38.931 --> 10:40.310
for her play off tickets.

10:40.758 --> 10:42.551
Damn right, dugout seats!

10:43.034 --> 10:44.275
I'd do it again.

10:46.034 --> 10:47.206
Interview your client,

10:47.344 --> 10:48.758
confirm the details
on this CJA sheet

10:48.896 --> 10:50.103
and try to get him out on bail

10:50.241 --> 10:51.758
or cop him out
to community service.

10:51.896 --> 10:53.862
But don't give anyone
a criminal record

10:54.000 --> 10:56.241
that doesn't already have one.

10:57.931 --> 10:59.034
Rookie dumping?

10:59.275 --> 11:00.241
Is this a preview of your

11:00.379 --> 11:01.724
brand new super fashion,
Charlie?

11:01.862 --> 11:04.413
I got four cases in Part F,
ten in AP5

11:04.551 --> 11:05.655
and two felonies set to trial.

11:05.793 --> 11:08.034
So, I dapper dodge you.

11:08.931 --> 11:10.551
Fly, baby bird, fly.

11:11.896 --> 11:13.482
What is that smell?

11:13.620 --> 11:16.862
A delightful popurri of piss,
B.O. and baloney sandwiches.

11:17.172 --> 11:19.448
It'll never come out
of that pretty suit.

11:24.448 --> 11:26.551
How did the victim
describe her attacker?

11:26.689 --> 11:28.241
She described him as
a black male

11:28.379 --> 11:29.758
wearing dark exercise sweats

11:29.896 --> 11:31.344
and a blue hoodie
with white lettering.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.965
Then after the victim
gave you this description,

11:33.103 --> 11:34.206
what did you do?

11:34.344 --> 11:35.862
My partner and I
canvassed the area,

11:36.000 --> 11:37.586
we saw the defendant
running near the crime scene,

11:37.724 --> 11:40.172
we stopped him and upon
performing a safety search,

11:40.482 --> 11:42.724
found a gold necklace
in his pants pocket.

11:42.862 --> 11:44.896
We transported him back
to the scene of the assault.

11:45.034 --> 11:46.241
What happened next?

11:46.379 --> 11:47.724
The victim identified
the defendant

11:47.862 --> 11:50.655
and the necklace,
I placed him under arrest.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.137
- Thank you.
- No further questions.

11:56.344 --> 11:58.689
Officer, when you found
the incredibly dangerous locket

11:58.827 --> 12:00.931
- in Mr. Lewis' shorts,
- Objection.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.482
Oh, lighten up, Hammond.

12:02.620 --> 12:04.689
Miss. Sullivan, please don't
taunt the prosecutor.

12:05.896 --> 12:07.827
When you transported Mr. Lewis
to the crime scene,

12:07.965 --> 12:09.413
where did you park
the patrol car

12:09.551 --> 12:11.241
in relation to the ambulance
treating the victim?

12:11.379 --> 12:13.413
Across the street,
a couple car lengths south.

12:13.551 --> 12:15.103
And did you keep
Mr. Lewis in the car

12:15.241 --> 12:16.586
or did you take him out?

12:16.724 --> 12:18.517
I took him out, uncuffed him,

12:18.793 --> 12:20.000
another officer
brought the victim

12:20.137 --> 12:21.379
partway across the street,

12:21.517 --> 12:24.172
she identified him
from about 20 feet away.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.758
She identified him
from about 20 feet away,

12:26.896 --> 12:28.551
would that be about...

12:32.310 --> 12:33.931
- This far?
- That's about right.

12:34.241 --> 12:35.758
When you took Mr. Lewis
out of the car,

12:35.896 --> 12:37.000
where did you stand him?

12:37.137 --> 12:38.103
Just outside the car.

12:38.241 --> 12:39.896
And was the door open or shut?

12:40.034 --> 12:42.517
Open, the victim identified him
before I even shut the door.

12:46.137 --> 12:48.379
You said you parked the car
just south of the ambulance

12:48.517 --> 12:49.793
and across the street?

12:49.931 --> 12:51.172
So, the other officer
walked the victim,

12:51.310 --> 12:52.517
what,
diagonally across the street

12:52.655 --> 12:53.655
toward the front
of your cruiser?

12:53.793 --> 12:55.103
Yes.

12:55.241 --> 12:56.620
So, you hid Mr. Lewis
behind the open door?

12:56.758 --> 12:58.103
Objection,
who said anything about hiding?

12:58.241 --> 13:00.241
Sustained, but now I'm curious.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.413
He was standing
behind the door,

13:02.551 --> 13:04.551
so the victim couldn't see
that he was wearing shorts

13:04.689 --> 13:05.724
and not sweat pants!

13:05.862 --> 13:07.206
Objection, speculation.

13:07.344 --> 13:09.586
Your Honor,
this show up hid a crucial way

13:09.724 --> 13:13.137
that Mr. Lewis' clothes did not
match the victims description

13:13.275 --> 13:14.965
and was therefore
unduly suggestive.

13:15.103 --> 13:16.896
Unduly being
the operative word here.

13:17.034 --> 13:19.103
They did not have to hide him
behind the door.

13:19.241 --> 13:20.724
They could have
let her see all of him.

13:20.862 --> 13:24.068
I move to suppress
the in-court identification.

13:26.068 --> 13:27.034
Enough.

13:27.344 --> 13:29.551
You two are worse
than my grandchildren.

13:29.793 --> 13:32.103
Standing the defendant
behind the cruiser door

13:32.241 --> 13:34.275
did not create a risk
that the victim

13:34.413 --> 13:36.000
would incorrectly identify him.

13:36.137 --> 13:37.517
The defense's motion
to suppress

13:37.655 --> 13:39.000
the victims in-court
identification

13:39.137 --> 13:40.620
of Mr. Lewis
is therefore denied.

13:40.758 --> 13:43.379
- Your Honor.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

13:43.517 --> 13:46.655
You get what you get
and you don't get upset.

13:47.172 --> 13:49.241
Alright, we will adjourn
for the day,

13:49.517 --> 13:50.931
we begin trial tomorrow.

14:09.068 --> 14:10.206
How is she?

14:11.034 --> 14:13.241
As I've heard you say,
she bouji.

14:13.758 --> 14:17.344
Well, she is a Caldwell fellow,
she makes 180 K to our 70.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.655
Just when I thought

14:18.793 --> 14:19.965
she couldn't possibly
annoy me more.

14:20.103 --> 14:21.413
Counselor,
I'll give him five days.

14:21.551 --> 14:22.758
Five days?

14:22.896 --> 14:24.344
But, Your Honor,
what about time served?

14:24.482 --> 14:25.724
He was just charged
with sleeping in the subway.

14:25.862 --> 14:27.413
Ah, sleep.

14:27.551 --> 14:29.827
Something you might get if you
laid off those energy drinks.

14:29.965 --> 14:31.551
Ask your client, counselor.

14:33.551 --> 14:35.896
We don't like her,
let the bouji have her sank.

14:36.034 --> 14:37.000
Shut up.

14:37.379 --> 14:38.862
Your Honor,
we have a rookie here.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.379
Really? I couldn't tell.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.310
- Ask your client.
- But...

14:43.448 --> 14:45.586
Miss Sullivan, I have
a docket to move here.

14:45.724 --> 14:46.896
OK.

14:47.034 --> 14:48.000
But why would he want
to go to jail.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.344
Five days, he serves three,

14:49.482 --> 14:50.896
that's three days
of three square meals

14:51.034 --> 14:53.310
and a roof over his head,
ask him.

14:55.241 --> 14:57.000
- Is this what you want?
- Yes.

15:01.137 --> 15:02.448
He'll take the five days.

15:03.413 --> 15:04.482
Welcome to hell.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.586
You remind me of your mother.

15:21.724 --> 15:23.931
Why? It's not a flask
and I like men.

15:29.517 --> 15:32.862
Yes, um, my daughter will have
a sparkling water, please.

15:33.137 --> 15:35.758
Dad, you know,
next time you invite me here,

15:35.931 --> 15:37.379
I'ma wear a dashiki
and a head wrap.

15:37.517 --> 15:39.655
That old bag, Judge Bolter
even stopped making women

15:39.793 --> 15:41.206
wear pantyhoes
in her court room.

15:41.344 --> 15:43.448
Look, this just a means
to an end, sweetheart.

15:43.586 --> 15:45.655
Back when I was practicing,
judge Brown overruled

15:45.793 --> 15:49.586
every objection I made,
until I became a member here.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.137
That couple,
they always like to talk

15:52.275 --> 15:54.241
about how all lives matter.

15:54.379 --> 15:57.310
I get such pleasure
from making them uncomfortable.

15:57.724 --> 16:02.482
So, I had drinks with
James Pinmore the other day

16:02.827 --> 16:04.344
and he said
that they would love

16:04.482 --> 16:06.827
for you to come and meet
at Hamilton Grey.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.344
Look, take the interview,
what's it gonna hurt?

16:10.482 --> 16:12.896
My soul, dad,
it would shrivel up and die!

16:13.034 --> 16:14.482
- Oh, come on.
- No, thank you.

16:14.620 --> 16:16.551
Look, I know you wanna
save the world

16:16.689 --> 16:18.137
but you could do it
more effectively

16:18.275 --> 16:20.241
from a place
like Hamilton Grey.

16:22.896 --> 16:24.482
What is this?
Some misguided attempt

16:24.620 --> 16:25.724
to help people
like your brother?

16:25.862 --> 16:27.172
My career is not about David!

16:27.310 --> 16:28.758
No, he got the time
that he deserved!

16:28.896 --> 16:32.000
Nobody deserves five years
for a burglary, Dad!

16:35.000 --> 16:38.103
I do this job because I believe
in it and I'm good at it

16:38.310 --> 16:39.655
and if you actually
took the time

16:39.793 --> 16:41.137
and came and watched me
you'd see that.

16:41.413 --> 16:42.827
But I guess you have to be
a drunk in this family

16:42.965 --> 16:43.965
to get your attention.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.379
If I remember correctly,

16:45.517 --> 16:47.689
I helped you pay
your rent last month.

16:48.448 --> 16:50.896
I'm not gonna sanction
your poor choice of a career

16:51.034 --> 16:53.241
by coming and watching you
in court.

16:55.689 --> 16:56.827
Wow.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.068
I thought we might have
a nice lunch,

17:03.586 --> 17:04.965
where for once, you know,

17:05.103 --> 17:06.655
you didn't mention
what a disappointment I am.

17:21.724 --> 17:23.896
Officer, this is Mr. Lewis'
arrest photo,

17:24.034 --> 17:26.482
would you please describe
what he is wearing.

17:27.034 --> 17:29.206
Black exercise sweats
and a blue nylon hoodie

17:29.344 --> 17:31.068
with dollar signs
across the front.

17:31.206 --> 17:32.689
Dollar signs, not lettering

17:32.827 --> 17:34.241
and actually Mr. Lewis
is not wearing black sweats,

17:34.379 --> 17:36.103
he's wearing black shorts,
isn't that right?

17:36.241 --> 17:39.034
Black sweatshorts, I thought
they matched the description--

17:39.172 --> 17:41.482
By matched, do you mean dollar
signs instead of lettering

17:41.620 --> 17:43.965
and shorts instead of pants,
withdrawn.

17:44.137 --> 17:45.620
When you conducted
your safety search,

17:45.758 --> 17:47.000
what did you do?

17:48.344 --> 17:49.758
I padded the defendant down

17:49.896 --> 17:52.724
and felt something
in his shorts pocket.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.655
I reached in and removed it.

17:55.586 --> 17:59.689
Officer,
this is a prop 9mm Glock.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.172
This is a Beretta 22.

18:03.310 --> 18:05.241
One of the smallest guns
on the market

18:05.379 --> 18:09.034
and these
are a variety of knives.

18:09.724 --> 18:14.000
Would you please explain
why this felt like a weapon?

18:14.275 --> 18:15.655
- Objection!
- On what grounds?

18:15.793 --> 18:17.172
You don't like the answer?

18:17.620 --> 18:18.793
Overruled.

18:20.310 --> 18:21.827
Don't gloat.

18:23.758 --> 18:24.896
You may answer.

18:25.344 --> 18:26.862
I didn't know what it could be.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.965
So, it was the non-descript
dangerous object?

18:30.275 --> 18:32.103
Your Honor,
during a Terry stop,

18:32.241 --> 18:34.655
the officer is allowed
to conduct a safety frisk

18:34.793 --> 18:37.103
but he is not allowed
to go into the suspects pocket

18:37.241 --> 18:38.724
and just pull out evidence.

18:38.862 --> 18:40.275
The locket should be suppressed.

18:40.413 --> 18:42.241
Your Honor, he did now know
what the object was,

18:42.379 --> 18:44.965
- it could have been anything--
- Not anything dangerous.

18:45.896 --> 18:48.103
She's right, Mr. Hammond,
the locket is out.

18:48.413 --> 18:51.620
Alright, we will continue
this hearing this afternoon.

18:53.241 --> 18:55.793
You might win some
but you just lost one.

19:02.206 --> 19:03.586
I thought Hammond
was trying to hide something

19:03.724 --> 19:06.068
in the Rosario
but there is nothing here.

19:09.379 --> 19:11.275
Uh, what's going on over there?

19:12.206 --> 19:13.758
No, that is my phone!

19:14.137 --> 19:15.586
Oh my God, I cannot believe

19:15.724 --> 19:16.862
my room mate
is getting dick pics

19:17.000 --> 19:18.379
and I don't know from who.

19:18.620 --> 19:19.827
I am underwhelmed.

19:22.310 --> 19:23.862
And who was that?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.413
I dunno, somebody keeps calling
and won't leave a message,

19:25.551 --> 19:27.413
probably AMEX,
apparently they're serious

19:27.551 --> 19:29.103
about this whole
minimum payment thing.

19:29.241 --> 19:31.827
It might be that new
ATB lawyer.

19:32.103 --> 19:33.551
I gave him your number.

19:33.689 --> 19:35.103
The knuckle-cracker?
Girl, you know he is annoying.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.000
Have you noticed
that you find anyone

19:37.137 --> 19:39.103
who's not your law school
professor crush annoying?

19:39.241 --> 19:41.275
Who, Bennet?
Girl, please, that's cray.

19:41.862 --> 19:43.551
We never even dated,
he doesn't like me like that.

19:43.689 --> 19:46.241
How do you know? You told me
you never put it on the table.

19:46.379 --> 19:47.827
- Because--
- Anyone seen the rookie?

19:47.965 --> 19:50.000
You lost the rookie,
that is awesome, good job.

19:50.137 --> 19:52.310
- I told you to watch her.
- I did, Charlie.

19:52.448 --> 19:54.379
And then I killer her
for her shoes.

19:55.379 --> 19:56.689
Hey, how did it go today?

19:57.172 --> 19:58.793
Well, it's not civil court.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.310
Ah, civil court...

20:00.448 --> 20:02.206
Where white people argue
over white people problems.

20:02.344 --> 20:04.000
Here, make yourself useful.

20:05.310 --> 20:06.482
What is this?

20:06.620 --> 20:07.965
Witness statements,
police reports,

20:08.103 --> 20:09.275
cop's memo book.

20:09.448 --> 20:10.448
What am I looking for?

20:10.586 --> 20:11.862
A defense theory.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.862
Well, shouldn't you
have figured it out

20:13.000 --> 20:13.827
from the discovery?

20:14.620 --> 20:15.655
Ain't she cute?

20:16.413 --> 20:18.310
Discovery is called
Rosario material

20:18.448 --> 20:19.758
and in criminal court

20:19.896 --> 20:20.931
we're not actually
legally entitled to it,

20:21.068 --> 20:22.517
until after the jury is sworn.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.068
That's not fair, how are you
supposed to prepare?

20:24.206 --> 20:25.517
You're catching on.

20:26.551 --> 20:27.724
What's with the redactions?

20:27.862 --> 20:29.344
That's the stuff
that proves he's innocent.

20:29.482 --> 20:31.724
Yeah, victim and witness,
addresses and phone numbers,

20:31.862 --> 20:34.206
we could interview them
but the prosecutor makes sure

20:34.344 --> 20:35.793
that we can't find them,
in fact,

20:35.931 --> 20:37.103
they black it out so hard

20:37.241 --> 20:38.827
that even if you hold it
up to the light--

20:40.448 --> 20:41.551
Wait a minute.

20:42.379 --> 20:43.793
Why didn't I catch that before?

20:43.931 --> 20:45.172
He missed one!

20:45.310 --> 20:47.034
This is the victim's
boyfriend's address.

20:47.172 --> 20:48.896
Do you still have
those phone records?

20:52.344 --> 20:54.758
According to the report,
she was on the phone with him

20:54.896 --> 20:56.068
when she was attacked

20:56.206 --> 20:57.758
and the cops
never even talked to him.

20:57.896 --> 21:00.344
Campbell, let's go see
what Mr. Boyfriend has to say.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.586
Miss Wong, you were attacked
at ten o'clock,

21:06.724 --> 21:08.448
coming from a yoga class,
correct?

21:08.793 --> 21:09.793
Yes.

21:09.931 --> 21:11.379
And when
this person attacked you,

21:11.517 --> 21:13.620
he pushed you to the pavement
face first, correct?

21:13.758 --> 21:16.517
Yes but I turned and saw him
very clearly

21:16.655 --> 21:18.241
before he pushed me down.

21:18.379 --> 21:19.931
Well, you were talking to your
boyfriend James on the phone

21:20.068 --> 21:21.551
when you first heard
someone behind you,

21:21.689 --> 21:23.413
- isn't that right?
- Yes.

21:23.551 --> 21:25.000
These are
your cell phone records,

21:25.137 --> 21:27.793
you were talking to him
for 42 minutes, right?

21:28.206 --> 21:29.413
I guess.

21:29.551 --> 21:31.103
It was an emotional
conversation, wasn't it?

21:31.241 --> 21:32.517
Yes, it was.

21:32.655 --> 21:33.931
You were distraught and crying,
weren't you?

21:34.068 --> 21:35.793
You'd been fighting
for 42 minutes

21:35.931 --> 21:38.206
and James said
he wanted to break up, right?

21:38.344 --> 21:39.586
Yes.

21:39.724 --> 21:41.241
In fact, James said he wanted
to break up

21:41.379 --> 21:43.172
and then you told him
that you might be pregnant?

21:43.310 --> 21:44.827
What does that
have to do with anything?

21:44.965 --> 21:46.517
I was almost raped!

21:47.620 --> 21:49.655
Your Honor, I am not trying
to embarrass this witness,

21:49.793 --> 21:51.620
I'm just trying to get at
her state of mind

21:51.758 --> 21:53.034
when she was attacked.

21:53.172 --> 21:56.241
Overruled but you are on
a very short leash.

21:57.241 --> 22:00.172
Miss Wong, you're a college
aged women who had sex!

22:00.310 --> 22:02.137
Nobody here is judging you,
in fact,

22:02.275 --> 22:04.034
everyone in this room had sex
at your age,

22:04.172 --> 22:05.827
except maybe Mr. Hammond.

22:08.758 --> 22:10.448
You were this upset
when you told James

22:10.586 --> 22:12.931
because you weren't happy about
maybe being pregnant, right?

22:13.275 --> 22:14.310
Yes.

22:14.620 --> 22:17.241
And, by the way,
it was pretty dark out there

22:17.379 --> 22:19.344
because these
three street lights

22:19.482 --> 22:22.000
were out that night, right?

22:23.896 --> 22:27.827
Yes, except the porch lights
at the fraternity were on.

22:28.103 --> 22:31.172
Ah, well this photograph taken
by our defense investigator,

22:31.379 --> 22:32.517
just two days later,

22:32.655 --> 22:33.965
shows
the fraternity lights out.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.724
The fraternity was suspended.

22:35.862 --> 22:39.275
They were suspended for hazing
the day after I was attacked.

22:39.931 --> 22:41.448
The lights were on that night.

22:42.034 --> 22:43.827
I might have been crying
but I saw who attacked me

22:43.965 --> 22:46.310
and I am one hundred percent
sure it was him.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.172
Judge, my client maintains

23:03.310 --> 23:04.310
the complainant
attacked him first,

23:04.448 --> 23:05.620
he was defending himself.

23:05.758 --> 23:07.103
The people offer
an A misdemeanor

23:07.241 --> 23:08.482
and 90 days, Your Honor.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.827
Alternatively we request
5000 dollars bail.

23:10.965 --> 23:13.103
Five thousand?
That's ridiculous!

23:13.241 --> 23:14.344
Five's not out of the ball park

23:14.482 --> 23:16.206
with a rap sheet
as long as his,

23:16.344 --> 23:17.862
how about 60 days?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.586
Your Honor, my client lives
in SRO, you might as well--

23:19.724 --> 23:20.862
Is that a no?

23:21.758 --> 23:24.068
I'll wave motions,
I want immediate an trial date.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.103
How about December 19th?

23:26.241 --> 23:27.655
That is ten weeks away.

23:27.793 --> 23:29.827
I can't manufacture
trial parts, Miss Campbell.

23:29.965 --> 23:31.241
What's happening?

23:31.551 --> 23:32.655
We're getting screwed,

23:32.793 --> 23:34.103
you gotta take the 60 days,
,Kenneth

23:34.241 --> 23:35.655
if you take the 60,
you'll be out in 40,

23:35.793 --> 23:37.379
if you fight it,
you're gonna be in for longer.

23:37.517 --> 23:38.793
But I didn't do it and
if I plead, I'll lose my room.

23:38.931 --> 23:40.172
counselor,
what date do you want?

23:40.310 --> 23:41.931
I need ten more seconds,
please!

23:42.068 --> 23:44.655
- December 19th for trial.
- Kenneth, take the plea.

23:44.793 --> 23:45.965
Bring in the next case, please.

23:46.103 --> 23:48.068
No, he'll take the plea,
he'll take it.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.103
- I wanna take the 5 years.
- That deal is off the table.

23:58.241 --> 23:59.448
Then I wanna testify.

23:59.586 --> 24:01.620
Absolutely not,
you have nothing to add!

24:01.758 --> 24:03.620
I got my story, my side.

24:03.758 --> 24:06.275
That prosecutor will
take you apart piece by piece.

24:06.413 --> 24:09.517
You think I'm just some...
What, some dumb ass thug?

24:10.310 --> 24:16.241
Look, I know I may not dress
like you or talk like you,

24:16.482 --> 24:18.206
with your,
"Why, yes, Your Honor,

24:18.344 --> 24:19.655
we'd like to have this evidence
thrown out of court, na, na."

24:19.793 --> 24:20.965
OK, you know what,

24:21.103 --> 24:22.517
you would make
a horrible witness.

24:22.827 --> 24:25.379
There are consequences,
Randell, to your neck tattoos

24:25.517 --> 24:27.931
and your saggy pants,
the jury is not gonna like you,

24:28.068 --> 24:30.034
not the white jurors
and not the black ones either,

24:30.172 --> 24:32.000
including the brother
who works for AT&T.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.344
He is not gonna like you

24:33.482 --> 24:34.862
because he thinks
you bring the curve down.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.275
I don't like it
but it is the truth.

24:38.103 --> 24:41.206
If you want me to let you
tell your story, I will.

24:42.137 --> 24:43.241
But all of your anger

24:43.379 --> 24:45.172
and your resentment
will spell out

24:45.310 --> 24:47.172
it is real,
and it is justifiable.

24:47.310 --> 24:50.413
But they will hate you
and they will convict you.

24:50.689 --> 24:52.103
Do you understand?

25:26.689 --> 25:29.241
This closet is for our clients,
Sullivan. Not for you.

25:29.379 --> 25:31.172
Although I am feeling
that green floral jacket.

25:31.310 --> 25:33.448
- Get out!
- What'’s wrong with you?

25:38.413 --> 25:40.241
Maybe you should stop
having these panic attacks

25:40.379 --> 25:42.379
if you'd admit
you still have feelings for me.

25:43.034 --> 25:45.206
Do you miss how I put
it down a little bit?

26:01.965 --> 26:04.275
No, stop, stop!
Worst idea ever!

26:04.413 --> 26:06.620
- Would I begged to differ?
- No, you are like a donut.

26:06.758 --> 26:09.758
You are like a maple,
glaze, bacon donut.

26:09.896 --> 26:12.275
Just a few seconds of fun
and you always regret after.

26:12.413 --> 26:15.241
- So, in bed it would be fun?
- This never happened, Charlie.

26:15.379 --> 26:17.275
Don'’t worry.
I'’m not gonna tell anyone.

26:17.413 --> 26:18.827
Except maybe the court offices.

26:18.965 --> 26:21.103
But I'’m sure they'll
keep it to themselves.

26:22.896 --> 26:25.241
- I don'’t have a defense.
- No woman does.

26:25.379 --> 26:28.758
Oh, my-- Do you claim
a tax deduction for that ego?

26:29.206 --> 26:31.931
You worry too much, Sullivan.
You go home at night

26:32.068 --> 26:33.827
and you lie awake
thinking about your clients.

26:33.965 --> 26:36.517
When I go home, I'm drinking
Macallan and playing Madden.

26:36.655 --> 26:38.517
And that'’s the difference
between us.

26:38.655 --> 26:40.137
You don'’t care about
your clients.

26:40.275 --> 26:41.655
You just care about winning.

26:41.793 --> 26:44.172
I care about my clients
by caring about winning.

26:44.310 --> 26:45.827
My guy has a shitty case.
He pleas.

26:45.965 --> 26:47.965
If it'’s a triable one,
we try it. And guess what?

26:48.103 --> 26:50.724
Most of the time my interest
and my clients'’ overlap.

26:51.068 --> 26:54.275
Wow! That'’s so inspiring.
you should copyright that.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.275
In fact,
if you become a supervisor

26:56.413 --> 26:58.275
why don'’t you just start
a welcoming speech

26:58.413 --> 27:00.068
for the rookies...

27:01.241 --> 27:02.413
What?

27:03.275 --> 27:05.793
Do you remember what Tom always
said when we just started?

27:06.034 --> 27:08.275
- Go back to basics!
- Go back to basics!

27:13.241 --> 27:14.862
Thanks, donut.

27:16.172 --> 27:19.172
So, we'’ll go meet back
in here later. Gwen!

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
- Charlie, again?
- Shut up!

28:06.379 --> 28:09.931
- Hands up! Don'’t shoot!
- Step away from the window.

28:12.689 --> 28:15.413
I just talked to your boss.
He ain'’t happy.

28:15.551 --> 28:16.931
What else can you do?

28:17.068 --> 28:19.586
Maybe you should reconsider
the whole burglar thing.

28:19.724 --> 28:20.931
If I was a blond named Jessica,

28:21.068 --> 28:22.379
would you still think
I was a burglar?

28:22.517 --> 28:24.000
Mam, you were trying
to jimmy the window.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.379
- Good point.
- Why were you trying to get in

28:25.517 --> 28:26.862
to turn on
the porch lights anyway?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.620
I was trying to see
the lighting conditions.

28:28.758 --> 28:29.965
This fraternity is on my beat.

28:30.103 --> 28:31.965
Trust me, porch lights
are blinding.

28:32.103 --> 28:33.344
Are you saying this
because it's true

28:33.482 --> 28:34.620
or because you want me
to lose my case?

28:34.758 --> 28:36.068
I'’ve got no dog in your fight.

28:36.206 --> 28:38.827
I might have,
But NYPD was not interested.

28:38.965 --> 28:40.344
Wait, what?

28:40.482 --> 28:41.862
I was involved tracking
the suspect that night.

28:42.103 --> 28:43.758
We picked up some guy
that fit the description,

28:43.896 --> 28:45.413
I radioed in to the NYPD.

28:45.551 --> 28:47.793
They said they already got
the guy. They cut our guy loose.

28:47.931 --> 28:49.896
Did you try and get paper work
over to the Prosecutor?

28:50.034 --> 28:51.310
Of course.

28:51.965 --> 28:53.965
- You withheld this.
- It was misfiled.

28:54.103 --> 28:55.448
Seriously, Hammond?

28:55.586 --> 28:56.965
Counsels, address the court,
not each other.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.827
I just showed
the victim this photo.

28:58.965 --> 29:00.517
- She said that was not him.
- You know that doesn'’t matter.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.344
My client'’s face
was invented in her brain

29:02.482 --> 29:03.931
because of that
ridiculous show-up.

29:04.068 --> 29:06.827
Counselors, I said
address yourselves to me.

29:06.965 --> 29:09.103
Your Honor, this clearly
is a Brady violation.

29:09.241 --> 29:11.241
I want sanctions,
dismiss the case.

29:11.379 --> 29:14.068
Did you know another person
had been detained?

29:14.206 --> 29:15.827
- No, I did not.
- Bullshit!

29:15.965 --> 29:17.620
It'’s the reason
why you offered my client

29:17.758 --> 29:19.862
three years because
he knew if I found out

29:20.000 --> 29:21.586
his case would disappear.

29:21.724 --> 29:23.862
One more curse word from you,
and I will hold you in contempt.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.655
That'’s like adult time out,
but worse.

29:26.793 --> 29:28.896
Now you can argue
all of these to a Jury.

29:29.034 --> 29:32.310
That'’s not enough. My client has
been in jail for nine months.

29:32.448 --> 29:34.206
Stop throwing a temper tantrum!

29:34.344 --> 29:36.827
Your Honor, how many people
are in Attica right now

29:36.965 --> 29:38.793
because the prosecution

29:38.931 --> 29:40.448
didn'’t forget the black guy'’s
out of the witness'’ dress!

29:40.586 --> 29:42.137
One more word, Miss Sullivan!

29:42.275 --> 29:44.310
This is a joke! The DA's Office
does this all the time.

29:44.448 --> 29:46.965
And I expect it from a prick
like him but not from you!

29:47.103 --> 29:48.758
You are supposed to care.

29:48.896 --> 29:51.586
We are not processing savages.
These are human beings.

29:51.724 --> 29:53.586
I mean, why will we even
bother with a trial at all?

29:53.724 --> 29:56.448
Why don'’t we just take him
back and hang him from a tree?

29:59.862 --> 30:01.517
Miss Sullivan,
you are in contempt.

30:01.655 --> 30:04.965
Officer Johnson, could you
please escort her to lock-up?

30:18.793 --> 30:20.344
How should they pay you?

30:20.586 --> 30:22.862
Nickle bag
just down on the corner

30:23.000 --> 30:24.517
and tell people
who to buy from.

30:24.655 --> 30:26.724
I think we might have
a good story for the Grand Jury.

30:26.862 --> 30:28.137
We are going to use
the fact that the cops

30:28.275 --> 30:30.379
recovered drugs
on you to our advantage.

30:30.517 --> 30:32.517
- How?
- We can make you a plain buyer.

30:32.655 --> 30:34.931
You weren'’t steering
anyone towards the dealer.

30:35.068 --> 30:38.103
Okay? You bought.
Some guy asked you to escort.

30:38.241 --> 30:40.172
There is a difference
between sale and possession.

30:40.310 --> 30:41.896
Cool!

30:52.862 --> 30:54.586
- You told them to lie.
- He is an addict

30:54.724 --> 30:56.689
facing a 4.5 to 9 now for
dealing. And all he did was

30:56.827 --> 30:59.034
take 5 dollars worth of heroin
to a point down the street.

30:59.172 --> 31:00.241
The rules are there
for a reason.

31:00.379 --> 31:02.103
Have you been paying attention?

31:02.241 --> 31:03.931
My client just plead guilty
to a crime he didn'’t commit

31:04.068 --> 31:05.310
because he couldn'’t
afford a bail.

31:05.448 --> 31:07.137
The rules are screwing
our client.

31:07.275 --> 31:08.793
But if we cheat, we only bring
ourselves down to their level.

31:08.931 --> 31:10.310
What are you doing here exactly?

31:10.448 --> 31:11.655
You just slumped it
for a few months?

31:11.793 --> 31:13.137
I didn'’t ask for this.

31:13.275 --> 31:15.206
I wanted in housing
or immigration.

31:15.344 --> 31:17.413
Oh, what happened?
Mommy and Daddy,

31:17.551 --> 31:19.482
they didn't fill
the right streams?

31:19.896 --> 31:21.586
You don'’t like me
because I have money?

31:21.724 --> 31:23.655
I don'’t like you cause you think
you are too good for this place.

31:23.793 --> 31:26.034
Because you hate
getting your hands dirty.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.000
I mean, look at these two guys.

31:30.137 --> 31:31.862
They don'’t look any more
like two black men

31:32.000 --> 31:34.896
you just grab on the street.
It'’s the cross racial of it all.

31:35.275 --> 31:36.655
Which I haven't brought up
in court yet.

31:36.793 --> 31:38.275
How would you do that
without an expert?

31:38.413 --> 31:40.620
Why people don't like to admit
we all look alike?

31:42.241 --> 31:43.758
Okay, okay.

31:43.896 --> 31:46.655
I know the contempt thing
is not very supervisorial.

31:46.793 --> 31:48.862
But are you seriously
considering Charlie?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.034
During a trial last month
he kept mispronouncing

31:51.172 --> 31:52.586
- his client'’s name.
- He did win.

31:52.724 --> 31:55.275
- It's all that matters.
- Gwen...

31:55.689 --> 31:58.241
Last month, you chased down
Judge Goldberg at his son's

31:58.379 --> 32:00.517
bar mitzvah demanding he lower
someone's bail.

32:00.655 --> 32:02.172
- Yeah.
- In the last trial you lost,

32:02.310 --> 32:03.827
you asked the Judge to hold
the Jury four times.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.896
Now you are in handcuffs
three times in three days.

32:06.034 --> 32:08.724
I mean, sometimes you are
a little bit too passion?

32:08.862 --> 32:11.206
- What'’s wrong with passion?
- Passion is great.

32:12.068 --> 32:14.137
Passion gave me
a heart attack at age 48.

32:14.275 --> 32:17.448
I want you to go out there and
apologize to Judge Blackwood.

32:17.586 --> 32:19.068
Absolutely not.

32:21.620 --> 32:26.413
Gwen, if you don'’t survive
the last battles,

32:27.517 --> 32:29.586
then you can'’t win the war.

32:35.344 --> 32:40.000
Apology accepted, Miss Sullivan.
She is a talented lawyer, Tom.

32:40.137 --> 32:42.000
Oh, I know she is, Judge.
And I appreciate--

32:42.137 --> 32:44.206
I mean, we appreciate
your tolerance.

32:44.413 --> 32:46.206
But she'’s just disrespectful.

32:46.344 --> 32:47.965
I'’m disciplined even if

32:48.103 --> 32:52.482
facial expressions in this
court, they're indescribable--

32:52.620 --> 32:54.931
- Holy shit!
- See! There, right there!

32:55.068 --> 32:57.241
No, Your Honor.
It's just-- I got an idea.

33:16.344 --> 33:18.482
Miss Wang,
if I were a sketch artist

33:18.620 --> 33:20.551
what would you tell me about
the man Who tried to rape you?

33:20.689 --> 33:24.275
Objection! Miss Sullivan
is not in fact a sketch artist.

33:24.413 --> 33:26.000
I'’ll allow it.

33:27.379 --> 33:32.827
Eh-- He was black, tall,
short hair.

33:32.965 --> 33:34.172
What about the shape
of his face?

33:34.310 --> 33:37.448
Regular, I guess,
kind of oval-ish.

33:37.586 --> 33:40.241
His hairline?
Was it square, round?

33:41.103 --> 33:42.344
I'’m not sure.

33:42.482 --> 33:44.655
His eyes, were they wide set,
closed together?

33:44.793 --> 33:47.379
- I'’m not really sure.
- How about his nose?

33:47.517 --> 33:51.517
Was it large, small,
wide, flat, pointy?

33:51.965 --> 33:53.862
- I don'’t know.
- How about his chin?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.965
or his chick bones,
his ears, his forehead.

33:57.103 --> 33:59.034
Is there anything
you can tell us?

34:00.137 --> 34:02.241
He was black.

34:02.379 --> 34:04.931
Yes, you'’ve told us.
He was black.

34:05.068 --> 34:07.413
Miss Wang, based
on your testimony just now

34:07.551 --> 34:10.310
this is the face of the man
who tried to rape you.

34:11.172 --> 34:13.241
My God! Objection!

34:13.379 --> 34:15.965
All right, not one more word,
either of you.

34:16.310 --> 34:19.137
Ladies and gentlemen, I'’m going
to ask you to step out, please.

34:32.620 --> 34:35.620
Your honor, Ms. Cooper
is a sketch artist certified

34:35.758 --> 34:38.310
by the international association
of identification.

34:38.448 --> 34:40.068
Your honor, this is outrageous.

34:40.206 --> 34:41.862
What is it outrageous
is this man

34:42.000 --> 34:43.379
being ripped from his life

34:43.517 --> 34:45.482
and his family and charged
with attempted rape

34:45.620 --> 34:48.103
based on nothing other than
it was a black man who did it.

34:48.241 --> 34:49.965
Your honor, after sitting
in this court room

34:50.103 --> 34:52.758
for several hours,
looking directly at Mr. Louis,

34:52.896 --> 34:54.275
she can'’t even identify him.

34:54.413 --> 34:56.034
No reasonable jury is going
to be able to find

34:56.172 --> 34:58.689
beyond a reasonable doubt
that he committed this crime.

34:58.827 --> 35:00.137
This is absurd.

35:00.275 --> 35:02.103
Sketch artists spend hours
with their victim.

35:02.241 --> 35:03.724
They have scores of questions

35:03.862 --> 35:06.482
designed to elicit
an accurate description.

35:06.620 --> 35:08.241
You wanna have the sketch
artist do that right here?

35:08.379 --> 35:10.137
We can let the jury
do the whole thing.

35:11.344 --> 35:12.862
Mr. Hamon?

35:19.206 --> 35:21.310
Then I am directing
a not guilty verdict

35:21.448 --> 35:22.689
in favor of Mr. Louis.

35:22.827 --> 35:23.931
Your honor.

35:24.724 --> 35:26.965
Mr. Hamon,
you get what you get

35:27.103 --> 35:28.965
and you don'’t get upset.

35:31.793 --> 35:34.172
Not guilty. It'’s over.

35:39.655 --> 35:41.000
Thank you.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.448
Why are you in a closet?

36:11.655 --> 36:13.137
Internal crash.

36:13.275 --> 36:14.413
Oh.

36:22.206 --> 36:23.482
This place is a nightmare.

36:23.620 --> 36:24.724
I know.

36:25.068 --> 36:26.620
The computers are
from like 1999,

36:26.758 --> 36:27.965
there'’s no support staff
to speak of

36:28.103 --> 36:30.413
and the entire place
has a smell.

36:30.724 --> 36:33.103
My bad, I thought you were
talking about the injustice.

36:33.241 --> 36:34.896
Like the fact that my client
almost went to prison

36:35.034 --> 36:37.517
because a college girl
can'’t tell black people apart.

36:38.206 --> 36:40.000
That too.

36:42.103 --> 36:44.000
Does this get any better?

36:44.586 --> 36:45.931
In some ways it does.

36:46.241 --> 36:49.137
You learn the law, you get
more comfortable in court

36:49.275 --> 36:50.793
you even get used to the smell.

36:51.517 --> 36:53.000
But chances are you'’ll screw up

36:53.137 --> 36:55.206
and some will go to jail
because of it.

36:55.482 --> 36:59.206
You just gotta learn
to live with it. All of it.

36:59.344 --> 37:00.482
Have you?

37:01.103 --> 37:03.655
Vanessa, I'’m sitting
in a clothes closet.

37:11.827 --> 37:14.965
You ran the guilty plea down
my client'’s throat yesterday.

37:15.965 --> 37:18.034
I'’ve got a hundred cases
on my docket.

37:18.275 --> 37:20.241
If I don'’t dispose of them
quickly I hear about it

37:20.379 --> 37:21.931
from the chief junction
and besides,

37:22.068 --> 37:23.827
if you didn'’t do this,
you did something else.

37:24.103 --> 37:25.482
You say some shit like that,

37:25.620 --> 37:27.379
it makes me not want
to have sex with you.

37:27.517 --> 37:28.724
Are you sure?

37:29.103 --> 37:31.517
You know, I hate
that I can'’t manipulate you.

37:31.896 --> 37:34.931
No, you don'’t. It turns you on.

37:35.241 --> 37:39.000
Maybe, maybe. But right now,

37:39.517 --> 37:41.586
the other thing
turns me off more.

38:04.206 --> 38:07.896
I'’ll definitely
be calling you. Cheers.

38:09.379 --> 38:10.965
You'’re gonna call twins?

38:11.620 --> 38:13.137
Not at the same time.

38:13.275 --> 38:17.137
Shots are in the room.
Let'’s do this thing,

38:17.758 --> 38:19.793
Oh yes, double fisting.

38:22.758 --> 38:23.931
Here'’s to the win.

38:24.068 --> 38:26.275
Can'’t wait to do it again.

38:30.793 --> 38:33.206
Drink number three
and you haven'’t eaten,

38:33.344 --> 38:35.137
do not get drunk
and fall on top of Charlie.

38:35.689 --> 38:37.241
Mind your business.

38:37.379 --> 38:39.482
It'’ll be my business next month
when you all are fighting

38:39.620 --> 38:41.689
like cats and dogs
and driving each other crazy

38:41.827 --> 38:43.862
and then you'’ll be like,
"“Why didn'’t you stop me?"”

38:44.000 --> 38:45.655
I'’m not sleeping with Charlie,
trust me.

38:45.793 --> 38:47.482
You better not be sleeping
with Charlie.

39:05.310 --> 39:08.413
Are you gonna stand there,
in that bad ass dress?

39:09.448 --> 39:12.724
Looking all fine and pretending
you don'’t want me?

39:13.965 --> 39:17.068
Or are can
live in this moment.

39:17.896 --> 39:20.896
Forget all those do's and don'’ts
fooling around

39:21.034 --> 39:23.000
pretty little head of yours.

39:24.241 --> 39:26.344
I can get these...

39:26.827 --> 39:30.034
Maple glazed bacon donut.

40:11.758 --> 40:13.448
What's with you
and these damn closets?

40:13.586 --> 40:14.724
Shut up.

40:26.931 --> 40:29.413
- Hey, what's going on in there?
- It's private!

40:34.034 --> 40:35.448
Next time on In Contempt

40:35.586 --> 40:36.862
Ladies.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.586
Oh, my Lord!
You slept with him last night!

40:38.724 --> 40:40.551
Charlie doesn't like
anyone but himself.

40:40.689 --> 40:42.000
No!

40:42.137 --> 40:43.724
Everybody'’s lying and don't
expect the truth

40:43.862 --> 40:45.275
until they trust you.
Remember, you'’re the lawyer.

40:45.413 --> 40:46.896
So, be confident
and authoritative.

40:47.034 --> 40:48.620
I don't care how you do it,
but you gotta find a way

40:48.758 --> 40:51.137
to get your client to trust you.
Especially you.

40:51.275 --> 40:53.586
You look and act
just like a prosecutor.

40:53.827 --> 40:55.655
There, Bennet.

40:55.827 --> 40:57.413
That's the hot law professor?

40:57.586 --> 41:00.068
I would show off
for his office hours.

41:00.310 --> 41:02.137
So here's to old friends
reconnecting.

41:02.344 --> 41:04.000
I'll drink to that.
