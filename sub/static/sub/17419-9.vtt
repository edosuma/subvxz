00:02.854 --> 00:04.448

00:04.500 --> 00:06.283
I don't get it... do I
call her, do I text her?

00:06.335 --> 00:08.118
(Grunts)

00:08.170 --> 00:10.056
This is so frustrating.

00:10.827 --> 00:12.743
Girls have it so much easier than we do.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.795
All they have to do is
walk outside and say,

00:14.881 --> 00:16.379
"I want to have sex right now",

00:16.416 --> 00:17.832
and then they're having sex with somebody.

00:17.917 --> 00:19.333
Preach.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.469

to give you a refund.

00:43.603 --> 00:44.003
Right.

00:44.057 --> 00:45.856
- The paperwork probably hasn't...
- It's fine. I'll take care of it.

00:45.866 --> 00:46.948
- Even gone to the office...
- I'll do it.

00:47.034 --> 00:48.116
And you'll tell everybody

00:48.168 --> 00:49.284
- at water polo?
- Yeah.

00:51.755 --> 00:53.121

- And please don't write about this.

00:53.173 --> 00:55.090
- No. No.
- Okay.

00:55.125 --> 00:56.508
- On the blog, okay.
- The blog is mostly for,

00:56.593 --> 00:58.343
- you know, civil rights stuff. It's not...
- Right.

00:58.429 --> 01:00.128

01:00.180 --> 01:01.513
Are you sure you're okay?

01:01.598 --> 01:03.598
- I'm okay. Are you okay?
- Okay. Yes.

01:03.634 --> 01:05.634
- Okay.
- (Chuckles) Yeah.

01:05.686 --> 01:08.136

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:41.064 --> 02:44.032
I know I've said it before, but
I really think that making partner

02:44.067 --> 02:46.401
- is right around the corner.
- Great.

02:46.453 --> 02:48.403
You know, but I was talking about...

02:48.455 --> 02:49.738
The Leo stuff.

02:49.790 --> 02:51.072
Mm-hmm.

02:51.158 --> 02:53.708
- Mm-hmm, the Leo stuff. Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:53.744 --> 02:55.327
Uh, don't worry about that...

02:55.412 --> 02:57.996
Please, 'cause everything's fine.

02:58.081 --> 03:00.415
He really made the best
decision for both of us.

03:00.501 --> 03:03.084
You know, we still really love each other.

03:03.170 --> 03:04.886
I'm fine.

03:04.922 --> 03:08.056
- You sure?
- Yeah. Definitely, definitely.

03:28.162 --> 03:29.361

03:29.446 --> 03:32.164
But I go first. That's exactly right.

03:32.249 --> 03:33.949
Me second! Me second! Thank you.

03:34.034 --> 03:35.784
- There we are. A little for you.
- Sarah's is the one

03:35.836 --> 03:37.502
with the treasure chest.

03:37.588 --> 03:39.588
So, what are you girls talking about?

03:39.623 --> 03:41.540
- Our husbands.
- Oh-ho!

03:41.625 --> 03:44.376
I bet you're married to
Mr. Tiger over there, eh?

03:44.461 --> 03:46.344
Hello. Hello there, Mr. Tiger.

03:46.430 --> 03:47.596
(Toy squeaks)

03:47.631 --> 03:48.964
Pleasure to meet you.

03:49.016 --> 03:50.131
My husband's name

03:50.217 --> 03:51.800
is Richard Kaplan.

03:51.885 --> 03:53.385
Holy shit.

03:53.470 --> 03:55.637
Th-that's...

03:55.722 --> 03:58.306
- Is that a real diamond?
- It'd better be.

03:58.358 --> 04:00.192
(Laughs): Otherwise,
Richard is in big trouble.

04:00.277 --> 04:01.643
(Girls laughing)

04:01.695 --> 04:02.894
(Awkward laugh) The cushion-cut

04:02.980 --> 04:05.313
solitaire is such a classic.

04:05.365 --> 04:07.482
Yeah. He did a really good job.

04:07.534 --> 04:10.869
I just wanted a simple band,
because I use a lot of play-doh.

04:14.825 --> 04:16.908
Katie, could you come out here for a sec?

04:16.994 --> 04:18.159
Yeah. Hey, mom.

04:18.212 --> 04:19.543
What's wrong?

04:19.630 --> 04:21.663
- All of these girls are married?
- Yeah.

04:21.748 --> 04:24.466
Except for my little Janie here.

04:24.501 --> 04:26.635
I'm starting karate in the fall,

04:26.670 --> 04:28.887
because when you're single
it's really important

04:28.972 --> 04:31.306
to put yourself out there.

04:31.341 --> 04:33.341
Katie: Yeah.

04:33.427 --> 04:35.393
I'm gonna go get those cupcakes.

04:35.479 --> 04:37.729
Great. Cupcakes.

04:39.233 --> 04:41.233
So, Janie, it's unbelievable

04:41.318 --> 04:42.484
that you're already seven.

04:42.519 --> 04:45.020
(Groans) Don't remind me.

04:45.105 --> 04:47.439
Why? You're not happy about it?

04:47.524 --> 04:50.442
Well, homework stuff is
good, so I'm happy about that.

04:50.527 --> 04:52.661
I mean, I know I've said
it before, but I really

04:52.696 --> 04:54.913
think making honor roll
is right around the corner.

04:54.998 --> 04:56.581
But I don't know.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.500
I'm in my late single digits,

04:58.535 --> 05:01.002
and I'm still the single
girl at the tea party.

05:01.038 --> 05:06.041
Jane: I try to stay positive,
but, man, I'm in a dark place.

05:06.093 --> 05:08.043
(Laughs): Jane, you're being so silly.

05:08.128 --> 05:10.045
You just need to enjoy
being a seven-year-old.

05:10.097 --> 05:12.681
You'll have plenty of time
to worry about icky boys

05:12.716 --> 05:16.017
- when you're older.
- Yeah, but at the same time,

05:16.053 --> 05:17.719
you don't want to wait <i> too</i> long.

05:17.804 --> 05:20.272
I've heard by third grade it's a wasteland.

05:20.357 --> 05:21.556
Okay, don't listen to them, Janie.

05:21.608 --> 05:22.724
Look at me. I'm way older

05:22.809 --> 05:24.442
than you, and I'm not married.

05:24.528 --> 05:25.560
(Horrified gasps)

05:25.612 --> 05:27.612
Girls: You're not married?!

05:27.698 --> 05:30.315
But you're so old.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.817
No, I'm not. I'm only 29.

05:32.903 --> 05:34.235
(Gasping) (Objects clattering)

05:34.288 --> 05:36.037
I had a cat once who was 15,

05:36.073 --> 05:37.656
and she died!

05:37.741 --> 05:39.407
We had to bury her in the backyard,

05:39.459 --> 05:41.409
and my mom says she's just bones now.

05:41.495 --> 05:42.877
But you're older than that.

05:42.913 --> 05:44.579
You're older than <i> Bones!</i>

05:44.665 --> 05:47.165
That's not exactly true.

05:47.250 --> 05:50.085
- We have an idea.
- We want to set you up.

05:50.137 --> 05:51.970
Okay. That's very cute,
girls, but I'm not looking

05:52.055 --> 05:54.756
- to be set up right now.
- I hate to say it,

05:54.808 --> 05:57.142
Liz, but at your advanced age of a million,

05:57.227 --> 05:59.844
it seems to me you don't have
as much time as you think.

05:59.930 --> 06:02.981
That's enough, girls. You may
be too young to understand this,

06:03.066 --> 06:04.933
but finding a man and getting married

06:04.985 --> 06:06.985
is not all that life has to offer.

06:07.070 --> 06:09.604
And if I do get married and have a family,

06:09.690 --> 06:11.856
it will be because the
timing is right for me

06:11.942 --> 06:14.659
and not because I was pressured
into it by a bunch of second graders.

06:14.745 --> 06:16.411
And by the way,

06:16.446 --> 06:18.613
29 is nowhere close to a million.

06:18.665 --> 06:20.949
You need to brush up on your math.

06:21.034 --> 06:23.668
You're right, Liz, I'm
not very good with numbers.

06:23.754 --> 06:27.339
<i>But</i> even if you meet a
guy today and you only date him

06:27.424 --> 06:29.040
for one year before you get engaged,

06:29.126 --> 06:31.459
and it takes you... One
year to plan the wedding,

06:31.511 --> 06:35.130
and it takes you at least
one year to get pregnant,

06:35.215 --> 06:37.098
and you want to have at least two kids,

06:37.134 --> 06:39.517
and you want them to be
at least two years apart,

06:39.603 --> 06:42.220
and you want to do all
this before you turn 40...

06:42.305 --> 06:44.856
because, man, after that
you're really playing with fire

06:44.941 --> 06:47.359
in terms of a whole host
of fertility problems...

06:47.444 --> 06:50.395
(thunder rumbling) Then I'd say
you really don't have a lot of time

06:50.480 --> 06:52.781
to meet this perfect mystery man.

06:52.816 --> 06:55.950
But like you said, I'm still learning math.

07:00.824 --> 07:03.324
Katie: All right, you guys,

07:03.410 --> 07:05.243
I've got cupcakes.

07:05.328 --> 07:08.163
Happy Birthday, Janie.
Make a wish, sweetheart.

07:08.248 --> 07:10.999

09:55.684 --> 09:57.968
Like a... like a banjo.

09:58.053 --> 10:00.720
(Chuckles) And he should have some
money. Because I have some money.

10:00.806 --> 10:03.023
And... but he can't be into
the fact that he has money

10:03.108 --> 10:05.475
or intimidated by the fact
that I have money. He's generous

10:05.560 --> 10:08.728
and sensitive. Like, he's not afraid
to cry, but he would... he would kill...

10:08.814 --> 10:11.031
He would kill someone
to protect his family.

10:11.116 --> 10:13.033
And I also want him to
live in my neighborhood,

10:13.118 --> 10:16.653
because I have very limited
free time, as you know.

10:16.738 --> 10:19.205
Yeah. Okay. I think you're
gonna have to settle yeah.

10:19.291 --> 10:20.874
For a little bit less than all of that.

10:20.959 --> 10:22.625
(Chuckles) Truth.

10:22.661 --> 10:23.994
Because that man you just described

10:24.079 --> 10:25.161
doesn't exist.

10:25.213 --> 10:26.830
Oh.

10:26.882 --> 10:31.001
"Truth." Who says "truth"?

10:31.053 --> 10:34.337
(Sighs) My standards
are too high, they say.

10:34.389 --> 10:36.506
Apparently he doesn't exist or something.

10:36.558 --> 10:39.726
What do they know? They're just paralegals.

10:40.896 --> 10:42.345
You're still young.

10:42.397 --> 10:45.598
You're... attractive.

10:45.684 --> 10:50.603
And making partner is
right around the corner!

10:51.773 --> 10:53.189
No.

10:53.241 --> 10:56.026
I won't settle.

10:56.078 --> 10:58.128
If he doesn't exist,

10:58.196 --> 11:01.031
- I will create him.
- (Thunder rumbling)

11:01.099 --> 11:02.699
(Cackles)

11:02.751 --> 11:06.086
If he doesn't exist,

11:06.171 --> 11:08.204
I will create him!

11:08.256 --> 11:09.756
(Cackles)

11:13.712 --> 11:15.795
Igor: Oh, master Liz.

11:15.881 --> 11:18.298
Now I think you are ready
to make your perfect man.

11:18.383 --> 11:20.300
- (Chuckles)
- Mmm. Yes.

11:20.385 --> 11:24.187
I've assembled the brain of Steve Jobs.

11:24.222 --> 11:26.356
He was a clever man.

11:26.391 --> 11:28.391
The heart of Nelson Mandela.

11:28.460 --> 11:31.227
The fingers of Jimi Hendrix.

11:31.313 --> 11:33.063
Oh, those beautiful brown fingers.

11:33.115 --> 11:36.116
The sun-kissed skin of Patrick Swayze.

11:36.201 --> 11:39.986
- Uh, pre- or <i> post-point break?</i>
- Shut up.

11:40.072 --> 11:43.573
And finally... The neighborhood proximity

11:43.625 --> 11:45.575
of that guy in my building

11:45.627 --> 11:48.244
who died last year!

11:48.296 --> 11:50.747
(Cackles)

11:50.832 --> 11:54.084
Master, this is gonna be
one seriously weird dude.

11:54.136 --> 11:55.718
Flip the switch.

11:55.754 --> 11:56.753
The switch.

11:56.805 --> 11:57.971
(Neck cracks)

11:59.257 --> 12:02.258
Flip the switch!

12:02.344 --> 12:03.927
(Creaking)

12:03.979 --> 12:05.662
(Crackling)

12:05.730 --> 12:06.813
(Laughs)

12:06.898 --> 12:08.098
(Lightning strikes)

12:08.166 --> 12:10.350
(Crackling)

12:13.855 --> 12:16.322
Hi.

12:16.408 --> 12:18.274
Hi.

12:18.326 --> 12:20.026
I don't think we've met.

12:20.112 --> 12:21.828
I'm Liz.

12:21.913 --> 12:24.080
So nice to meet you, Liz.

12:24.116 --> 12:25.715
I hope you don't mind my playing.

12:25.784 --> 12:27.333
I majored in classical guitar

12:27.419 --> 12:30.620
at Yale and mastered the flamenco style

12:30.672 --> 12:32.705
in my travels through Andalusia.

12:32.791 --> 12:34.874
I love flamenco.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.093
Did I mention I'm Jewish?

12:37.129 --> 12:39.129
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:39.214 --> 12:41.631
I'm sorry. I-I thought you knew.

12:41.683 --> 12:43.550
Knew what?

12:43.635 --> 12:45.101
I'm gay.

12:45.170 --> 12:47.804
You are?

12:47.856 --> 12:51.975
Yeah. I'm, like, really,<i> really</i> gay.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.644
But I thought I made the perfect man.

12:54.696 --> 12:57.013
You did. And he's gay.

12:57.065 --> 13:00.283
(Ringtone plays)

13:00.352 --> 13:02.085
- It's Frank.
- Man: Hey, Frank.

13:02.154 --> 13:03.319
You coming to fire island with us?

13:03.388 --> 13:05.538
Fire bad!

13:05.624 --> 13:07.991
Jk. I'll be right out.

13:08.043 --> 13:10.877
See you, darlings.

13:10.962 --> 13:13.796
(Whimpers)

13:13.832 --> 13:17.333
Don't worry. He wasn't
good enough for you anyway.

13:17.385 --> 13:20.670
Thanks, Igor.

13:20.722 --> 13:25.041
Say, uh, you seem kind of tense.

13:25.093 --> 13:29.345
Uh, maybe you should slip off your coat

13:29.431 --> 13:32.182
and let me give you a massage.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.684
- What?
- Or we could

13:34.736 --> 13:37.103
just watch a movie and see what happens.

13:37.189 --> 13:38.521
(Chuckles) Hmm?

13:38.607 --> 13:41.357
- No. No, that's not...
- No?

13:41.443 --> 13:43.660
That's never, ever going to happen.

13:43.728 --> 13:45.862
You're my employee.

13:49.034 --> 13:50.500
Bitch.

13:52.299 --> 13:55.068
Patti: Aw, Liz, have you been on any dates?

13:55.120 --> 13:56.870
Mom, no, not really.

13:56.905 --> 13:59.572
I'm just... I'm just
focusing on work for a while.

13:59.658 --> 14:02.409
Why don't you let me set you up with Chip?

14:02.461 --> 14:03.710
Chip? Mom, no.

14:03.745 --> 14:05.245
I'm not going out with Dr. Fringle's son.

14:05.330 --> 14:06.463
Why not?

14:06.548 --> 14:08.415
You went to Camp Machanga together.

14:08.467 --> 14:09.466
Yeah, well, we have no chemistry.

14:09.551 --> 14:12.052
Oh, how do you know that?

14:12.087 --> 14:13.803
You haven't seen him in years.

14:13.889 --> 14:15.922
Chip's a real catch.

14:15.974 --> 14:18.425
He's smart, he's got a good job,

14:18.510 --> 14:21.094
and he's a real gentleman.

14:21.179 --> 14:23.596
Liz, you've just, you've
got to just try it.

14:23.682 --> 14:24.931
(Liz sighs)

14:24.983 --> 14:26.349
Okay, fine, I'll go out with Chip.

14:26.435 --> 14:27.684
Yay.

14:27.769 --> 14:29.686
That a girl.

14:29.771 --> 14:31.905
(Music plays, low conversations)

14:36.328 --> 14:39.112
So, um...

14:39.164 --> 14:41.114
How's your dad?

14:41.166 --> 14:42.999
He is good.

14:44.369 --> 14:47.921
D-do you ever watch T... TV?

14:47.956 --> 14:48.838
No.

14:50.676 --> 14:52.125
Uh, the weather's...

14:52.210 --> 14:53.626
The weather, wow, it has been...

14:53.712 --> 14:54.928
I have prepared three topics

14:54.963 --> 14:56.629
of conversation for this date.

14:56.715 --> 14:59.132
Would you like to hear one?

14:59.184 --> 15:00.850
Sure.

15:00.936 --> 15:02.886
Please select from the following subjects:

15:02.971 --> 15:06.222
Politics, a business trip
I took to Minneapolis,

15:06.308 --> 15:09.609
or quotations from popular movies.

15:09.644 --> 15:12.612
Um... let's go with movies.

15:12.647 --> 15:14.781
(Music plays) You have
selected movie quotations.

15:14.816 --> 15:19.152
In the 1994 new line cinema hit,<i> The Mask,</i>

15:19.237 --> 15:21.154
star Jim Carrey's catchphrase was...

15:21.206 --> 15:23.373
"Somebody stop me."

15:23.458 --> 15:25.041
Can I get another Manhattan, please? Or...

15:25.127 --> 15:27.660
"S-s-s-s-s-s-smokin'."

15:27.746 --> 15:30.997
Why don't you tell me
about, um, accounting.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.999
What's that like for you?

15:33.085 --> 15:35.635
The practice of accounting,
or the measuring

15:35.670 --> 15:37.337
and processing of financial information...

15:37.422 --> 15:39.339
Uh... no, no, no.

15:39.391 --> 15:41.391
Uh, I meant, what is it like for you?

15:41.476 --> 15:42.842
The Egyptians and  Babylonians

15:42.928 --> 15:45.478
had early bookkeeping systems as well.

15:45.514 --> 15:47.814
The profession of accounting was developed

15:47.849 --> 15:49.065
in the 19th century...

15:49.151 --> 15:50.350
The word "accountant" is derived

15:50.402 --> 15:53.103
from the French word <i>compt-e-r.</i>

15:53.188 --> 15:55.939
And that leads to me, and
my job at Ernst & Young

15:56.024 --> 15:59.609
where I am in the top 21%
of management accountants.

16:03.165 --> 16:04.864
I apologize.

16:04.950 --> 16:08.034
I have been monopolizing the conversation.

16:08.086 --> 16:10.587
Please, Liz, tell me about you.

16:10.672 --> 16:12.372
I'm do corporate law

16:12.424 --> 16:14.340
and a little bit of pro
bono work on the side.

16:14.376 --> 16:16.876
I analyzed your trial statistics

16:16.962 --> 16:19.262
based on what I could
find in the public record.

16:19.347 --> 16:23.049
You are in the top ten percent
of lawyers at your firm.

16:23.101 --> 16:25.552
I predict you will soon make partner.

16:25.637 --> 16:28.304
Do you really think so?

16:28.390 --> 16:30.640
Yes. It is right around the corner.

16:33.728 --> 16:35.311
- How is your steak?
- Um... it's a little rare.

16:35.397 --> 16:37.480
I'm more of a well done kind of...

16:37.566 --> 16:39.566
Oh, God. Wow.

16:39.618 --> 16:41.401
That is... that's a flame.

16:41.453 --> 16:42.786
Is that better?

16:44.372 --> 16:46.072
Wow.

16:46.158 --> 16:47.907
It is, thank you.

16:47.993 --> 16:49.993
Your eyes are very unique.

16:50.078 --> 16:52.245
I am having trouble processing the color.

16:52.330 --> 16:54.547
(Beeping, whirring)

16:54.583 --> 16:56.216
(Tones chime) Color processed.

16:56.251 --> 16:57.884
They are green.

16:57.919 --> 17:02.722
Liz, I remember the first time
I saw you at Camp Machanga.

17:02.757 --> 17:04.641
I have had a crush on you

17:04.726 --> 17:06.759
since you won the long swim.

17:06.845 --> 17:08.595
- Wait, you remember that?
- Yes,

17:08.646 --> 17:10.680
I have never deleted the memory.

17:10.765 --> 17:13.233
Would you like to hear the dessert menu?

17:13.268 --> 17:15.101
Uh, no, thank you. I'm full.

17:15.153 --> 17:16.236
We are fine.

17:16.271 --> 17:19.071
A girl as sweet as you

17:19.107 --> 17:22.775
does not require dessert;
You are sweet enough already.

17:22.861 --> 17:25.744
I meant that figuratively.

17:25.780 --> 17:27.946
I was using sweetness as a metaphor.

17:28.032 --> 17:31.284
I hope I did not suck the
romance out of the compliment

17:31.369 --> 17:34.504
by overexplaining the logic behind it.

17:34.589 --> 17:36.789
No, you didn't at all.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.625
That was very sweet.

17:38.710 --> 17:41.010
Do you want to dance?

17:41.096 --> 17:43.463
Yes, but I only know one move.

17:43.515 --> 17:45.131
The robot.

17:45.217 --> 17:46.633
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

17:46.685 --> 17:48.134
All right, let's see what you got.

17:48.186 --> 17:50.770
♪ ♪

17:55.560 --> 17:57.810
Hey, is there room in there for me?

17:59.781 --> 18:01.030
You do not know

18:01.116 --> 18:04.317
how long I have waited for this moment.

18:04.402 --> 18:07.654
I will initiate sex now with your consent.

18:07.706 --> 18:08.821
Wait, wait. Um,

18:08.907 --> 18:10.123
do you have something, uh...

18:11.993 --> 18:14.827
(Zapping) Condom applied.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.380
Initiating sex sequence.

18:17.465 --> 18:18.831
Three,

18:18.884 --> 18:19.799
two,

18:19.834 --> 18:21.000
one. Oh.

18:21.052 --> 18:22.802
(Boing, drip sounds)

18:22.837 --> 18:25.588
(Chuckles) That was great.

18:25.674 --> 18:28.091
Okay. Uh, we're done?

18:28.176 --> 18:30.009
Orgasm achieved.

18:30.095 --> 18:31.728
Um... but...

18:31.813 --> 18:33.846
Sex sequence complete.

18:33.899 --> 18:36.399
Liz: All right. Uh...

18:36.484 --> 18:37.850
I'm gonna go to the
bathroom. Do you want a...

18:37.903 --> 18:39.352
Glass of water or something?

18:39.437 --> 18:42.939
Actually, I should probably get going.

18:43.024 --> 18:44.657
- You're leaving?
- Listen, Liz,

18:44.693 --> 18:48.578
tonight was fun, but I just
got out of a long-term thing.

18:48.663 --> 18:52.532
I am not ready to jump
into a new relationship.

18:52.584 --> 18:54.701
When did I say anything
about a relationship?

18:54.786 --> 18:57.170
- I will exit now before it gets weird.
- I didn't say anything

18:57.205 --> 18:58.755
about a relationship.
You said "relationship".

18:58.840 --> 19:01.791
Maybe I'll see you around.

19:01.876 --> 19:04.711
Bye, Liz.

19:09.134 --> 19:11.351
(Clanging footsteps)

19:14.139 --> 19:15.722
(Loud crash)

19:15.807 --> 19:18.858
(Clanging footsteps continue)

19:24.440 --> 19:26.691
(Liz crying softly)

19:31.614 --> 19:34.115
Oh, Liz. Thank God you're home. Okay.

19:34.150 --> 19:36.450
I've been... I've been trying to
get in touch with you all week.

19:36.486 --> 19:39.453
Okay. Here's the deal. Um, I
really, really like this girl,

19:39.489 --> 19:41.906
Danielle, but I don't know if
I should call her or text her.

19:41.991 --> 19:43.958
Uh, I keep panicking and hanging up.

19:43.993 --> 19:45.960
Do-do you think she can see
that? I mean, it-it never goes

19:45.995 --> 19:48.579
to voice mail, so I'm not sure if sh...

19:49.749 --> 19:51.799
Liz, are you crying?

19:51.834 --> 19:53.968
- Mm-mm.
- No? I... okay.

19:54.003 --> 19:57.054
So if I text her, I...

19:57.140 --> 19:59.674
You're... Definitely crying.

19:59.726 --> 20:02.843
All these people who are way younger
than me are already married, and mom said

20:02.895 --> 20:04.478
that I should just settle for someone.

20:04.514 --> 20:07.064
But why are you listening
to any of these people?

20:07.150 --> 20:08.816
You never listen to anyone.

20:08.851 --> 20:10.685
- I know, but...
- No, you're

20:10.737 --> 20:12.520
actually the smartest person I know.

20:12.572 --> 20:14.321
Everyone should be listening to you.
