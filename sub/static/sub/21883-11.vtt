WEBVTT

01:24.167 --> 01:25.710
Leave me alone.

03:03.725 --> 03:07.687
<i>I feel the warmth</i>
<i>From my boiling blood</i>

03:08.271 --> 03:12.400
<i>I feel the fear, sweat dripping away</i>

03:12.525 --> 03:16.487
<i>There's a stillness</i>
<i>That nothing transmits</i>

03:17.155 --> 03:23.328
<i>I'm a breeze that grows stronger</i>

03:23.536 --> 03:26.664
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

03:27.790 --> 03:31.419
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

03:32.170 --> 03:35.715
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

03:36.716 --> 03:40.845
<i>To unleash my return</i>

03:45.391 --> 03:49.312
<i>I have the dust that protects the road</i>

03:49.562 --> 03:53.691
<i>I have the branches of a leafless tree</i>

03:54.400 --> 03:58.363
<i>I'm the guardian of the tired night</i>

03:58.571 --> 04:04.619
<i>There are silhouettes that</i>
<i>come to meet me</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:09.499
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

04:09.582 --> 04:12.543
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

04:13.586 --> 04:17.257
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

04:18.383 --> 04:22.262
<i>To unleash my return</i>

04:26.391 --> 04:27.392
NACHO PRIETO'S SAFE HOUSE

04:27.475 --> 04:28.643
<i>You got off the</i>
<i>truck shooting, asshole.</i>

04:28.726 --> 04:29.852
<i>You were also shooting.</i>

04:29.936 --> 04:31.354
<i>The boss gave an order!</i>

04:33.815 --> 04:35.900
<i>Métrico said Arturo was there!</i>

04:36.025 --> 04:38.903
<i>Quiet! Don Ismael</i>
<i>wants us to meet with Don Joaquín.</i>

04:38.987 --> 04:40.613
<i>He wants to see all of us.</i>

05:08.099 --> 05:10.935
Graciela's Residence

05:49.182 --> 05:51.100
They're preparing everything for the wake.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.769
It'll be at Saint Martin.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.030
It's your fault.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.826
My son's death is because of your greed.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.347
Don't touch me.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.849
Get out of my house.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.102
They brought Quino, sir.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.388
You have to leave Mexico.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.934
You'll go to Canada.

08:39.143 --> 08:42.313
When?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.148
-After the wake?
-No.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.776
You can't go to the wake.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.239
I have to see my brother.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.326
If we go, we'll put everyone at risk.

08:58.329 --> 09:02.083
Your mom and your grandmother
will be there on your behalf.

09:04.877 --> 09:08.589
CHAPO'S RESIDENCE

09:40.955 --> 09:44.125
-Where are they?
-There.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.253
Go get them.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.717
Go to your room.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.203
Mr. Joaquín.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.497
We're here to pay for our mistake.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.379
We came for you to kill us.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.254
Get out.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.578
Take care.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.887
<i>Do you know who</i>
<i>killed him, lieutenant?</i>

12:42.970 --> 12:45.848
<i>We assume it was</i>
<i>Arturo Bernal Leyda's men.</i>

12:45.973 --> 12:47.725
<i>But that hasn't been confirmed yet.</i>

12:50.102 --> 12:52.897
-Keep me posted.
<i>-Of course, sir.</i>

13:00.988 --> 13:02.281
<i>If Arturo didn't do it...</i>

13:03.407 --> 13:04.783
<i>who should we thank, then?</i>

13:05.659 --> 13:07.369
<i>It doesn't matter who killed him.</i>

13:07.745 --> 13:09.914
<i>We'll take advantage of it.</i>

13:10.414 --> 13:12.708
Let's not give him a chance
to do anything.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.044
Call Arturo.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.505
The sooner we act, the better.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.220
<i>If you send me more men,</i>

13:25.012 --> 13:27.306
<i>we can make the soundtrack for that wake.</i>

13:29.433 --> 13:32.603
Fine, I'll take care of Culiacán.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.397
You go after the rest of the territories.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.692
<i>Even though the authorities</i>
<i>haven't confirmed it yet,</i>

13:38.776 --> 13:40.861
<i>all signs point to Bernal Leyda's men</i>

13:40.945 --> 13:43.113
<i>as the main suspects</i>
<i>in Guzman Loera's son's murder.</i>

13:43.197 --> 13:45.199
BREAKING NEWS
"EL CHAPO" GUZMAN'S SON DEAD IN Culiacán

13:45.282 --> 13:47.368
<i>-The authorities are...</i>
-Chente, It's done.

13:47.535 --> 13:51.455
-...concerned <i>for a possible cartel war...</i>
-Let me know when your men are ready.

13:52.414 --> 13:56.210
<i>Authorities have expressed</i>
<i>concern for possible retaliation.</i>

13:58.087 --> 14:00.631
<i>It is expected...</i>

14:07.388 --> 14:09.723
You got the worst punishment
for a traitor.

14:25.531 --> 14:29.827
<i>You've reached the voicemail.</i>
<i>This call will be charged after the tone.</i>

14:31.036 --> 14:32.872
My deepest condolences.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.666
Please, call me as soon as you can.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.537
Thank you.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.065
He couldn't sleep last night.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.734
He wants to be alone.
He doesn't look well.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.904
Talk to him, please.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.669
Listen to this.

16:04.505 --> 16:08.425
<i>My deepest condolences.</i>
<i>Call me as soon as you can.</i>

16:12.596 --> 16:14.431
Call him. I've got nothing to say.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.688
There's no truce in this war,
even less now.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.232
That's why I didn't kill Macho Prieto
and his men.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.236
If he's gonna die, it should be
defending Culiacán.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.824
We'll defend the territory together.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.413
The funeral must be starting.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.627
I want to see my son one last time,
and I can't. How can I fix that?

16:44.211 --> 16:46.296
You must continue to lead the charge.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.841
We need you.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.468
I can't be here,
and not go to his funeral.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.804
I'll go to La Tuna.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.725
Go there with protection.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.311
Don't forget we're at war.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.526
You can't forget that.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.207
Will I win this war?

17:28.839 --> 17:32.176
It shows that you'll succeed.
Even so, you must be careful.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.180
I know.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.432
I can't trust anyone.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.144
Look,

17:42.478 --> 17:43.896
I'll tell you names.

17:44.104 --> 17:46.065
Tell me if I can trust them.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.317
Garcia Arroyo.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.618
Nothing comes out.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.912
Can I trust him or not?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.498
Yes, you can.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.422
Vazquez Arana?

18:14.593 --> 18:15.969
Give him a chance.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.400
Wait. I'm not done yet.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.660
Luciano Darba.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.805
It's not clear, sir.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.099
Then, why should I be careful?

19:09.189 --> 19:10.566
You're lying, right?

19:14.486 --> 19:15.654
Sure?

19:20.617 --> 19:23.036
Is Ponciano a traitor?

19:32.504 --> 19:34.256
Son of a bitch.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.559
Are you sure you don't want me to go?

19:52.065 --> 19:54.359
I want to be alone.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.658
Then, I'll go to the funeral.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.954
Sir.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.539
Mrs. Esperanza's here.

20:35.442 --> 20:36.944
I told you, Joaquín.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.405
I told you to stop.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.788
SAFE ROOM

20:51.625 --> 20:53.043
What the fuck?

21:10.394 --> 21:11.603
I brought you this.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.693
<i>We already have</i>
<i>10 men in Navolato.</i>

21:17.776 --> 21:19.736
<i>Ready to get to Culiacán</i>
<i>at a moments notice.</i>

21:19.820 --> 21:22.322
-Don't go in until I tell you, Chente.
<i>-Got it.</i>

21:26.952 --> 21:28.787
It'll be difficult to get there.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.248
They haven't lowered their guard.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.792
Chente's men could try.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.378
Worst case scenario, they are killed.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.006
We'll continue attacking El Chapo.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.439
What's your opinion of Ponciano?

21:55.814 --> 21:57.899
-The businessman?
-Yes.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.610
We've never had issues with him.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.571
You know something?

22:04.406 --> 22:06.116
He works for Joaquín.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.536
Where'd you get that information?

22:12.497 --> 22:14.499
You can smell betrayal.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.218
Bring me Ponciano's sons.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.273
ROAD TO LA TUNA

23:46.299 --> 23:47.968
<i>Where is he?</i>

23:48.051 --> 23:49.678
<i>He doesn't return my phone calls,</i>

23:49.761 --> 23:50.679
<i>he doesn't return my messages.</i>

23:51.596 --> 23:54.641
I understand how difficult
it is to lose a son.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.643
This is not the time to disappear.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.356
Moreno's death was an internal error.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.651
That makes it more difficult.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.528
What do you mean an "internal error"?

24:13.785 --> 24:16.580
<i>Joaquín ordered that</i>
<i>Arturo Bernal be hunted.</i>

24:18.957 --> 24:21.042
<i>His son was the one who was hunted down.</i>

24:27.632 --> 24:29.092
They got confused.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.016
His enemies will take advantage of it.

24:37.934 --> 24:41.271
I'll take care while he recovers.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.648
If he ever does.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.404
<i>He'll come through.</i>

24:51.489 --> 24:54.826
<i>He'll call you when you least expect it.</i>

25:54.469 --> 25:56.638
I've never lost someone close to me.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.642
How would it feel to lose a son?

26:04.354 --> 26:06.523
From what I've heard,
he has a large family.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.902
I mean, so he won't feel lonely
in such a harsh time.

26:13.029 --> 26:14.489
Joaquín's moved by ambition.

26:16.908 --> 26:19.536
Ambition sometimes comes with a high cost.

26:21.579 --> 26:23.999
-What about you?
-What about me?

26:26.376 --> 26:28.712
What price are you willing to pay to
become president?

26:53.153 --> 26:54.988
Thank you for coming.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.832
My condolences, Graciela.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.716
Get away from him while you still can.

27:17.427 --> 27:19.179
Joaquín only brings pain.

27:36.571 --> 27:38.656
Mr. Arturo, this is a mistake.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.033
OK, motherfuckers...

27:41.910 --> 27:43.536
your dad's lying to me.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.373
He's working with El Chapo.

27:47.749 --> 27:50.460
No, sir, he only works for you.

27:57.175 --> 27:59.010
We'll find out.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.684
How's it going, Ponciano?

28:07.060 --> 28:09.229
Yeah, they're fine, for now.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.732
I heard you're a traitor,
working for El Chapo.

28:14.109 --> 28:17.695
No, Ponciano, don't promise me things.

28:18.321 --> 28:20.490
You have 'till dawn
to prove it's not true.

28:23.701 --> 28:26.913
Look... don't worry, guys.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.916
If your dad's clean...

28:30.166 --> 28:32.085
nothing will happen to you.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.513
Arturo.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.101
Ponciano's been nothing but loyal to us.

28:48.351 --> 28:51.062
I've been investigating.
They all say he's with us.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.565
You have to focus on attacking Joaquín.

29:01.614 --> 29:02.907
Let's see.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.536
Will you bet your life
on Ponciano's innocence?

29:09.914 --> 29:11.499
-No?
-No.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.210
See?

29:25.346 --> 29:27.682
Our men are heading to Culiacán, sir.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.058
<i>Kill all the federales.</i>

29:30.393 --> 29:32.812
<i>Chapo doesn't know what he's in for.</i>

29:32.896 --> 29:34.898
<i>No Federales will be left alive.</i>

29:50.830 --> 29:52.957
<i>...call will be charged...</i>

29:55.210 --> 29:57.420
Answer me, <i>compadre. </i>We need you.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.839
The Emes are in Mazatlán.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.175
In Culiacán, the Federales
were slaughtered.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.428
Your enemies are taking advantage.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.097
They'll attack again.

30:15.396 --> 30:17.398
Take your men and go on patrol.

30:19.400 --> 30:23.321
You can't bring El Moreno back,
but you can defend Sinaloa.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.052
Damn!

32:05.298 --> 32:07.800
<i>They've just reported</i>
<i>two more clashes,</i>

32:07.884 --> 32:09.844
<i>we're losing ground in Culiacán.</i>

32:10.511 --> 32:12.847
Ask the army for help.
They need to take the streets back.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.475
Take down all the assailants.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.062
Get rid of their bodies, leave no trace.

32:19.812 --> 32:24.275
<i>During the night, altercations</i>
<i>and gunfights took place in Culiacán.</i>

32:24.442 --> 32:27.278
<i>More than a dozen Federales were killed.</i>

32:27.362 --> 32:30.865
<i>Many others were injured</i>
<i>with a reserved prognosis.</i>

32:30.990 --> 32:35.411
<i>The army is on the streets to guarantee</i>
<i>the citizens' safety.</i>

32:42.251 --> 32:44.128
Mr. Ismael.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.716
No, he's still locked in.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.511
<i>He ordered us to leave him alone.</i>

32:51.844 --> 32:54.889
Keep knocking until he opens the door.
I need to speak to him.

33:20.206 --> 33:21.791
Mr. Joaquín.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.215
Sir.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.051
Mr. Ismael needs to speak with you.

34:11.424 --> 34:12.425
Joaquín.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.304
My son gets buried today.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.682
Yeah.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.560
He gets buried today.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.438
I need you to do me a favor.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.566
<i>Compadre...</i>

34:29.067 --> 34:31.235
I understand what you're going through...

34:31.694 --> 34:33.696
<i>but the government</i>
<i>is putting pressure on us,</i>

34:34.363 --> 34:36.616
<i>and Chente Cano and Arturo</i>
<i>are hot on our heels.</i>

34:37.867 --> 34:39.410
<i>Joaquín, you need to come back.</i>

34:41.621 --> 34:43.039
This is bigger than you.

34:44.499 --> 34:47.168
<i>You started this war,</i>
<i>you can't go back on it.</i>

34:53.174 --> 34:54.467
Joaquín?

34:55.843 --> 34:57.512
I need a favor.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.450
How are my sons?

35:19.867 --> 35:22.995
Prove to me you don't work for Joaquín,
and you'll see them today.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.874
Please, Arturo, who told you
this nonsense?

35:27.750 --> 35:31.170
I got nothing to do with El Chapo,
I only work for you.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.298
You said you had proof. Let me see it.

35:35.758 --> 35:39.220
You can see there that I have always
paid you what was due,

35:39.345 --> 35:40.721
nothing less.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.266
Well, I made a mistake once.

35:44.559 --> 35:47.520
My accountant didn't report some earnings
sent to Switzerland.

35:47.603 --> 35:50.106
He told me, I ordered for it
to be transferred to you.

35:50.356 --> 35:51.732
You have proof there.

35:53.776 --> 35:55.486
Let my sons go, please.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.119
-You believe him?
-It was a single mistake.

36:04.203 --> 36:06.122
It has nothing to do with El Chapo.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.623
You believe this fucker?

36:16.215 --> 36:17.842
Fine...

36:21.345 --> 36:22.471
but I don't.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.021
Let's go.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.356
Move.

36:32.773 --> 36:34.108
Keep your eye on that dog.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.070
Arturo, please...

36:38.362 --> 36:39.780
Trust me!

36:39.906 --> 36:41.115
Let my sons go!

36:49.040 --> 36:50.374
Thank you.

37:08.351 --> 37:11.145
WE RAN OUT OF ROSES

37:13.231 --> 37:15.483
OUT OF ROSES

37:36.420 --> 37:38.839
LIVE
BURIAL OF "EL CHAPO" GUZMAN'S SON

38:00.194 --> 38:01.988
Ismael.

38:02.571 --> 38:04.407
Did you do what I asked?

38:04.490 --> 38:07.326
<i>Yes, </i>compadre <i>everything's set,</i>
<i>just as you asked.</i>

38:08.286 --> 38:09.620
Thank you, <i>compadre.</i>

38:09.704 --> 38:13.207
<i>Joaquín, come back to Culiacán.</i>
<i>Don't be alone during this time.</i>

40:08.656 --> 40:11.325
You started a path
you can't turn back from.

40:15.329 --> 40:17.373
What's going on, Chapo?

40:17.456 --> 40:19.500
You started a path
you can't turn back from.

40:23.045 --> 40:26.132
You started a path
you can't turn back from!

40:40.980 --> 40:42.690
Gimme that, fucker.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.733
You don't deserve it, fucking kid.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.193
Get the fuck out.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.195
Get out!

42:10.194 --> 42:12.655
-Dad...
-How did it go, son?

42:13.072 --> 42:15.699
It went fine.
I'm tired, but it all went fine.

42:55.656 --> 43:01.662
<i>This would be my life,</i>
<i>if I started it over again.</i>

43:36.572 --> 43:37.656
<i>If I could choose...</i>

44:19.865 --> 44:22.618
<i>I would shoot one thousand times more.</i>

44:51.146 --> 44:54.983
<i>This morning, Culiacán arose</i>
<i>bathed in blood all over again.</i>

44:55.067 --> 44:59.321
<i>During the early morning hours, </i>
<i>six gun battles were reported between</i>

44:59.405 --> 45:00.906
<i>rival cartels.</i>

45:00.989 --> 45:02.699
<i>The bodies of businessman</i>
<i>Ponciano Dalba's sons were</i>

45:02.783 --> 45:03.909
WE ARE HERE, CHAPO.
ARTURO.

45:03.992 --> 45:06.078
<i>were abandoned at the corner of...</i>

45:06.161 --> 45:08.956
Ponciano never worked for me.

45:11.125 --> 45:13.919
Arturo's thinking
everybody's betraying him.

45:14.002 --> 45:16.630
BREAKING NEWS
MORE BODIES FOUND WITH NARCO BANNERS

45:18.090 --> 45:20.008
That's good.

46:10.392 --> 46:12.478
Those roses... it was you.

46:18.775 --> 46:20.569
I'm heading back to Culiacán, Mom.

46:26.909 --> 46:28.202
Go then.

46:30.204 --> 46:31.747
May God protect you.

46:44.301 --> 46:46.386
Ismael, <i>compadre...</i>

46:47.638 --> 46:48.889
I'm on my way.
