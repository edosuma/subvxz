Catching me ain't going to do you no good,
Dynamic Dingbats.

00:22.190 --> 00:26.528
My Shame's got your Batgirl,
and he ain't gonna let her go.

00:26.736 --> 00:29.572
Not till he's finished committing
the crime of the century.

00:29.781 --> 00:32.909
- Which is?
-Which is none of your business.

00:41.251 --> 00:44.003
You reckon she's all right,
Batgirl, in the trunk of the car?

00:44.212 --> 00:46.381
I don't suppose she'll be going anywhere,
Shame.

00:46.589 --> 00:48.216
- Yeah. Hi.
- How do you do?

00:48.424 --> 00:51.886
- That's a good-looking six shooter you got.
-Uh, would you like to look at it?

00:52.095 --> 00:54.180
I'd be mighty grateful, if you wouldn't mind.

00:54.389 --> 00:56.599
It's a beautiful piece of machinery.

00:56.808 --> 00:59.644
Yeah, that's a beautiful piece of machinery.
How much is that?

00:59.852 --> 01:02.272
Oh, it's 69.95.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.108
Well, now, 69.95, that's too much.
Do it shoot straight?

01:05.316 --> 01:07.193
Up to 300 yards.

01:07.402 --> 01:09.279
All right, in that case, stick them up.

01:10.446 --> 01:13.950
You know, I had a funny feeling
you were gonna say that.

01:14.158 --> 01:16.244
Gang, hang him up on the wall
for safekeeping.

01:16.452 --> 01:19.789
Come on. Get all that stuff ready
for the great train robbery.

01:21.624 --> 01:24.877
Come on, come on. Let's hustle it up here.
Come on, let's go. Come on.

01:25.086 --> 01:28.256
Will you put me down?
I'll give you all nice presents.

01:28.464 --> 01:30.717
Will you stop it? What are you doing?
Ooh, ooh!

01:30.925 --> 01:32.719
Shame, honey, you seen my ma?

01:32.927 --> 01:35.263
Yeah, I seen too much of her lately.

01:35.471 --> 01:38.141
I think we must've left her at the stable
with the horses.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.977
Well, don't worry, nobody will notice.

01:41.185 --> 01:42.687
We gotta go back and get her.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.981
No can do, lover.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.317
By now, she's probably a prisoner
of the police.

01:47.525 --> 01:49.652
Might as well give her up for gone.

01:49.861 --> 01:52.447
Honey, she's my mother, the only one I got.

01:52.655 --> 01:53.698
Yeah, I know.

01:56.868 --> 01:58.995
Oh, don't be like that.

01:59.203 --> 02:02.915
I know she's a battle-ax and an old owl,
but she is my flesh and blood.

02:03.124 --> 02:06.669
Yeah, I was wondering about that heredity.
What'd your father look like?

02:06.878 --> 02:10.590
- Oh, he was prettier than my ma.
-Nobody could be uglier.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.343
Well, can't we try and rescue her?

02:13.676 --> 02:15.678
You want me
to bust into police headquarters?

02:15.887 --> 02:18.056
That's like putting my own head
in my own noose.

02:18.264 --> 02:21.809
Well, we could trade her for Batgirl,
like a prisoner swap.

02:22.018 --> 02:23.519
No, that ain't no swap.

02:23.728 --> 02:27.273
If I swapped like that, I wouldn't have a pot
to put my head in for a haircut.

02:27.482 --> 02:31.819
Can't we try, honey? Please? Please?

02:32.028 --> 02:35.615
Oh, you know I can't stand
to see a woman cry.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.492
All right.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.111
I wonder if Batgirl is still alive.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.573
Who knows
what that demented desperado will do.

03:58.781 --> 04:01.534
- Maybe he's just holding her hostage.
-No, I don't think so.

04:01.743 --> 04:05.413
I think he has something else in mind,
something infinitely more heinous.

04:05.621 --> 04:08.291
Otherwise, he would have called us by now.
Don't you agree, commissioner?

04:08.499 --> 04:10.626
Huh? Oh.

04:10.835 --> 04:14.088
I beg your pardon, Batman.
My mind was elsewhere.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.798
My daughter, Barbara,
has been missing since yesterday.

04:17.007 --> 04:20.052
And while the welfare of Gotham City
is important...

04:20.261 --> 04:23.306
...worries of my daughter's welfare
keep invading my thoughts.

04:23.514 --> 04:25.808
Now, what...?
Please, what was it you were saying?

04:26.017 --> 04:27.643
<i>How.</i>

04:27.852 --> 04:32.273
It's Chief Standing Pat.
He's one of Shame's henchmen. I--

04:32.482 --> 04:34.108
No, Chief O'Hara.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.402
He's obviously here for a reason.

04:36.611 --> 04:38.821
Hmm. Let's hear what he has to say.

04:39.030 --> 04:43.117
Man with blue-and-white face
speak with straight tongue.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.745
I come talk peace treaty with you.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.663
What are your terms?

04:47.872 --> 04:51.667
Shame willing to trade Batgirl
for Frontier Fanny, even up.

04:51.876 --> 04:53.419
What's the catch?

04:53.628 --> 04:58.633
Shame usually has three or four aces
and a derringer up his scheming sleeve.

04:58.841 --> 05:03.095
You no try catch us,
we let Batgirl go with full scalp safe.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.348
- No deal.
-That's fine by me.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.559
Her scalp look good on my belt.

05:10.645 --> 05:13.022
Just a minute, chief.

05:13.314 --> 05:17.360
Commissioner, I know how you feel
about criminals, and I echo those sentiments.

05:17.568 --> 05:20.196
But Batgirl has been very valuable
to all of Gotham City...

05:20.404 --> 05:24.867
...through her pluck and her heroism.
I don't think we can afford to lose her now.

05:25.076 --> 05:27.453
And the alternative to this deal is death.

05:29.413 --> 05:33.668
Very well, Dynamic Duo,
I leave the decision in your gloves.

05:35.962 --> 05:37.713
You tell Shame...

05:37.922 --> 05:42.552
...we'll agree to any of his terms
as long as Batgirl is safe.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.346
Then you bring Fat Squaw
to Central American pavilion...

05:45.555 --> 05:47.723
...at Gotham City World's Fair.

05:47.932 --> 05:50.393
It closed now. No one bother us.

05:50.601 --> 05:54.897
We meet when little hand is on 11
and big hand is on 12.

05:55.106 --> 05:57.441
Chief Standing Pat has spoken.

05:59.402 --> 06:02.238
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, back at the ammunition store...</i>

06:02.446 --> 06:05.992
<i>...Shame and his aides
are celebrating their coup.</i>

06:07.910 --> 06:10.705
Well, aides, that was quite a coup.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.915
What's the news, Standing?

06:13.124 --> 06:17.295
Batman agree to terms,
but he no longer under spell of Fear Gas.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.088
Him heap, heap, brave, brave now.

06:19.297 --> 06:22.341
Yeah, we'll see
how heap, heap, brave, brave he is.

06:22.550 --> 06:27.513
We're gonna dry-gulch them varmints
in the Central American pavilion...

06:27.722 --> 06:32.101
...and after we get them out of our sombrero,
we're gonna conduct what I like to refer to as...

06:32.310 --> 06:34.103
- ...the great train robbery.
<i>- Great train</i> robbery.

06:34.312 --> 06:37.106
And after that, we're gonna head west.

06:37.315 --> 06:43.321
I arranged powwow for when little hand
is on 11 and big hand is on 12.

06:43.529 --> 06:47.533
- Let's see, that'd be, uh... That'd be, uh...
-Eleven o'clock, Shame, honey.

06:47.742 --> 06:50.828
Eleven o'clock, Shame, honey.
Dad-blame it, I know it.

06:51.037 --> 06:53.748
Now, now I got a plan.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.625
Now, I got a plan.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.376
Now, here's my plan.

06:57.585 --> 07:01.797
We're gonna go to the Central...

07:02.006 --> 07:03.049
To the Central, uh...

07:03.257 --> 07:05.259
- American Pavilion.
-American Pavilion.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.387
And after we get there,
we're gonna get there...

07:08.596 --> 07:11.098
- We're gonna get there...
-Early.

07:11.307 --> 07:12.350
Early.

07:12.558 --> 07:15.978
And then after that, we're gonna--
We're gonna...

07:16.187 --> 07:17.355
Bushwhack them.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.107
Bushwhack them.

07:20.316 --> 07:22.151
That Batgirl still tied up?

07:22.360 --> 07:24.737
She's in the trunk of the automobile.

07:24.946 --> 07:27.698
Good. All right, let's go. Come on, let's go.

07:27.907 --> 07:29.742
Tallyho.

07:31.619 --> 07:34.038
Are you sure he's Mexican?

07:42.004 --> 07:45.508
<i>NARRATOR". But even as Batman and Robin
race along the highway...</i>

07:45.716 --> 07:48.803
<i>...Shame is arriving
at the Central American pavilion...</i>

07:49.011 --> 07:51.305
<i>...with deadly punctuality.</i>

07:51.514 --> 07:53.432
All right, gang-

07:54.183 --> 07:58.145
We'll hide right here
till them Caped Clods come moseying in.

07:58.354 --> 08:01.190
But no shooting till Mama's safe.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.526
Yeah, no shooting till Mama's safe.

08:03.734 --> 08:07.697
- Stop it!
- Hey. Hold your tongue. I think I smell a bat.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.365
Stop it, stop it!

08:09.573 --> 08:13.077
Yeah, I smell a bat. Skedaddle. Skedaddle.

08:15.997 --> 08:18.165
You let me go!

08:18.749 --> 08:21.794
You finally got wise to it,
you couldn't hold me.

08:22.003 --> 08:24.547
Not while my prospective son-in-law...

08:24.755 --> 08:27.842
...still has an ounce of strength
in his crooked body.

08:28.050 --> 08:31.303
All right, keep your feet planted, Batboys...

08:31.512 --> 08:34.597
...before I put a picture window in your skull.

08:34.807 --> 08:37.058
You wouldn't shoot us in cold blood?

08:37.268 --> 08:40.855
Cold blood, hot blood, warm blood,
makes no never mind to me.

08:41.063 --> 08:44.900
- Just pass over our Frontier Fanny.
-Where's Batgirl?

08:45.901 --> 08:49.864
Don't make a deal, Batman.
They'll gun you down.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.657
Get away from our Fanny.

08:51.866 --> 08:53.409
He'll let us have it if we do.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.328
Still, we can't hide behind a woman.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.956
I have in my utility belt a Bat-chemical...

08:59.165 --> 09:03.085
...which changes the physical property of metal
and makes it 20 times heavier.

09:03.294 --> 09:05.838
Let's see how effective it is.

09:06.047 --> 09:08.299
Watch it, Shame. He's up to a trick.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.514
Doggone it. Doggone it, Batman.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.726
You cheated.
You know we ain't no good in a fair fight.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.062
That's what I was counting on, Shame.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.392
Get away from me.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.928
Okay, come on.
Let's get while the getting's good.

10:36.137 --> 10:39.098
- Come on.
-They ain't gonna deduct our plan, anyway.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.143
We're two hoots and a holler ahead of them.
Come on.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.616
Of all the rotten luck.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.787
Take heart, Batgirl. All is not lost.

11:01.996 --> 11:04.874
We'll catch Shame
before this day is through.

11:05.082 --> 11:08.669
And truth and justice will win out.

11:12.423 --> 11:15.551
Are you sure the phone isn't out of order,
operator?

11:17.219 --> 11:19.388
Very well, thank you.

11:19.597 --> 11:21.557
- Still no word?
-None.

11:21.765 --> 11:26.228
And it isn't like Barbara to go off like this.
I've had no word from her in two days.

11:26.437 --> 11:30.399
- I'm certain she's all right, commissioner.
-How can you be?

11:30.608 --> 11:33.736
Just, uh... Call it a woman's intuition.

11:33.944 --> 11:35.070
Batgirl.

11:35.279 --> 11:38.741
Exactly what did Shame talk about
while you were in his custody?

11:39.825 --> 11:41.368
It's a bit difficult to recall.

11:41.577 --> 11:45.623
I was still under the influence
of Fear Gas for quite a while...

11:45.831 --> 11:49.919
...but I do remember his saying something
about the great train robbery.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.962
Hmm...

11:52.171 --> 11:54.465
Mm-hmm.

11:54.673 --> 11:59.803
So we don't know which train he means.

12:00.012 --> 12:03.474
But there is one train that runs
under Gotham City every night...

12:03.682 --> 12:06.310
...to pick up the cash
from the subway stations.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.271
But it's mostly coins...

12:09.480 --> 12:12.942
...and the money is so bulky,
it would be very hard for them to travel fast.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.485
Ergo, rule that one out.

12:19.281 --> 12:22.117
There's a mail train
that comes into Gotham City once a day...

12:22.326 --> 12:26.163
...carrying a great many negotiable checks
and bonds.

12:26.705 --> 12:30.459
You weren't around
when we first encountered Shame, Batgirl.

12:30.668 --> 12:33.671
No, a mail train is not his modus operandi.

12:34.171 --> 12:36.757
I think we all need some refreshment.

12:36.966 --> 12:41.512
What would you be saying to some soft drinks
to cool off your brows? On me, of course.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.514
Splendid idea, Chief O'Hara.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.228
I better be turning this one into the bank.

12:49.436 --> 12:53.023
Heh. It looks like it's been in circulation
since the turn of the century.

12:57.695 --> 13:00.990
Chief O'Hara, that's the answer.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.492
- It is?
-Today's the day when the government...

13:03.701 --> 13:08.497
...ships all the old money out of town by train
to be burned.

13:08.706 --> 13:11.500
Old money that's tattered and torn
is collected by banks...

13:11.709 --> 13:14.003
...and turned over to the treasury
for destruction.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.005
That must be what Shame's been after.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.966
- We'd better get moving.
-And fast.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.177
<i>NARRATOR".
But are you in time, Batman?</i>

13:22.386 --> 13:26.640
<i>Because, even now,
evil events are being put into motion.</i>

13:29.476 --> 13:31.562
This is my first run on the money train.

13:33.105 --> 13:35.524
I get kind of nervous
with all this cash around.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.192
Not a thing to worry about.

13:37.401 --> 13:40.529
I make the same trip every month
at the same time.

13:40.738 --> 13:42.573
Never even came close to a robbery.

13:42.781 --> 13:46.452
It's practically impossible.
This train doesn't stop for anything.

13:46.660 --> 13:51.165
You know, they'd have to sever the rails
with an acetylene torch to even slow it down.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.754
What if someone did stop the train?
What then?

13:56.962 --> 13:58.380
No problem.

13:58.589 --> 14:04.303
This car is made out of 3-inch armor plate.
It's impregnable. Nothing can crack it.

14:04.511 --> 14:09.850
With the possible exception
of a 283-karat diamond drill.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.327
That Fear Gas works every time.

14:28.535 --> 14:33.874
Please. Please don't hurt us, mister.
I'm a family man. I got a wife and kid.

14:34.083 --> 14:37.211
I'm a bachelor, but-- But--
But I wanna live anyway.

14:39.838 --> 14:44.551
Good. Oh, good. Good.

14:45.302 --> 14:48.263
All right, let's round up this dinero,
partners.

14:48.472 --> 14:53.227
We got a lot of gravel to scratch
before the sun winks down.

14:59.358 --> 15:00.526
We're too late.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.362
Please, don't beat us up, Batman.
It wasn't our fault.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.657
There, there. Compose yourself, citizen.
We understand.

15:06.865 --> 15:10.119
You don't have to snivel and cower.
It's that dreaded Fear Gas again.

15:10.327 --> 15:11.745
Oh, this is terrible, Batman.

15:11.954 --> 15:15.833
Shame's flown the coop soot-free and we
haven't got any clue to his whereabouts.

15:16.041 --> 15:19.086
Allay your trepidation, Robin.

15:19.294 --> 15:23.257
- Do you have an idea?
-it's an extremely long shot, Batgirl.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.969
An appeal to Shame's inordinate egomania
may flush him out.

15:27.177 --> 15:30.889
Meanwhile, let's administer
these bravery tablets to these yeomen...

15:31.098 --> 15:36.186
...in order to counteract
that horrible Fear Gas.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.400
What is this you're tinkering with?

15:41.608 --> 15:43.152
It's a skywriter drone, Alfred.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.029
I've programmed it
to write a message across the sky.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.990
If we're lucky, Shame will see it.

15:48.282 --> 15:52.703
It's an invitation for Shame to meet me
in man-to-man combat, unarmed.

16:06.091 --> 16:11.346
Yeah, doggies, I reckon I'm happier
than a horse in a yard full of oats.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.390
- Ha-ha-ha!
-How much you figure we got, Shame?

16:13.599 --> 16:16.518
Oh, about 83 million, give or take a hundred.

16:16.727 --> 16:20.856
After I get through weeding through this
grubby stuff, we ought to still have over 60 mil.

16:21.064 --> 16:24.526
And how is this vast fortune to be allocated?

16:24.735 --> 16:26.153
Yeah...

16:26.361 --> 16:27.863
...he's Mexican, all right.

16:28.071 --> 16:33.702
Look, Fred, I got no truck for a man
that talks 8 pounds to the word.

16:33.911 --> 16:38.624
Now, you talk English like us normal folks
or don't talk, Fred. Get it?

16:38.832 --> 16:41.043
- Got it.
-Good.

16:41.460 --> 16:45.797
- How do you plan on divvying up the spoils?
-That's better.

16:46.006 --> 16:49.760
You and the chief get 1 million each.
That ought to keep you in tacos for a while.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.387
What about me?
Don't I get something for my troubles?

16:52.596 --> 16:54.473
Yeah, you get a rich son-in-law, Fan.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.643
Look. Up in sky.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.521
It's a bird.

17:00.729 --> 17:01.813
It's a plane.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.982
No, it's a message for me.

17:04.191 --> 17:08.362
"Shame, you are a lily-livered coward.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.989
Meet me on Neptune Ave...

17:11.198 --> 17:15.993
...in the deserted and condemned
tenement district at high noon...

17:16.203 --> 17:20.582
...if you think you can beat me
without your gang or your guns.

17:20.790 --> 17:24.795
Just bring your two fists and I'll bring mine.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.839
Signed, Batman."

17:28.590 --> 17:31.134
Why, that Caped Clown.

17:31.343 --> 17:32.553
That's an insult.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.266
Darned if I won't be there.

17:37.474 --> 17:40.561
I'll be there all right. I'll be there all right...

17:40.769 --> 17:46.108
...and I'll knock out so many of his teeth,
he'll have to eat his steak through a straw.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.111
Shame, honey, it's a trap. Don't go.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.113
You bet it's a trap.

17:51.321 --> 17:55.284
Only this time, we're the trappers
and he's the trapee.

17:55.492 --> 18:00.831
Fred, get the police on the phone
and tell them Shame is coming back.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.628
A man's gotta do what he's gotta do.

18:06.837 --> 18:12.301
That's why I deliberately chose
that urban renewal area...

18:12.509 --> 18:14.011
...the one that's condemned...

18:14.219 --> 18:17.514
...so that no innocent bystanders
would get shot up.

18:17.723 --> 18:20.017
You may get shot up.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.770
This town's gotta be cleaned up...

18:23.979 --> 18:27.190
...so that little children are safe...

18:27.399 --> 18:31.028
...and happy and healthy growing up.

18:32.321 --> 18:37.034
Well, in case something happens to me,
I know you'll carry on without me.

18:37.242 --> 18:40.954
Chief O'Hara. In case something happens.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.331
- Commissioner.
-Good luck.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.041
Thank you.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.835
Batgirl.

18:47.044 --> 18:49.963
- Batman, I--
-Don't say it, Robin.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.633
I understand.

19:17.574 --> 19:20.869
You wait until me and Batman
is 20 feet apart...

19:21.078 --> 19:24.164
...then I want you to drill him,
and drill him good.

19:24.373 --> 19:27.125
And I don't want just blood, I want gore.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.835
- Get it?
-Got it.

19:29.044 --> 19:30.921
Good. Now...

19:31.129 --> 19:35.967
...you wait till you see the whites of his eyes
through his slits.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.388
Good luck, Shame, honey.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.683
Dumpling, I don't need luck
as long as I've got you.

19:43.809 --> 19:46.478
Couldn't you just get sick?

19:50.399 --> 19:52.859
Hey, Batman, you fake.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.280
Don't you ever smile?

19:57.489 --> 20:01.201
You look grimmer
than a losing football coach.

20:01.410 --> 20:03.912
Perhaps I should unbend a little.

20:04.121 --> 20:06.915
Thank you for the constructive criticism,
Shame.

20:07.124 --> 20:10.168
Your mother wore Army shoes.

20:10.377 --> 20:11.586
Yes, she did.

20:11.795 --> 20:14.840
As I recall,
she found them quite comfortable.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.884
They're about 30 feet apart now.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.469
Now, get ready.

20:19.678 --> 20:24.558
I'm gonna keep on insulting you
till you run out of cheeks to turn.

20:24.766 --> 20:29.980
If you need to be vitriolic, vituperative
and vindictive, Shame, you go right ahead.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.231
Just as I thought.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.859
We've got to stop them before they fire.

20:34.067 --> 20:37.195
<i>- I'll</i> take the two women, you handle the men.
- Right.

20:37.404 --> 20:42.325
A few feet more, Batman will have
more holes in him than a Texas oil field.

20:47.998 --> 20:50.041
Now it'll be fair.

21:01.219 --> 21:04.347
What's wrong, Shame? Lost your nerve?

21:05.098 --> 21:07.058
How far you figure we are apart?

21:07.267 --> 21:09.352
Eighteen feet, six and a half inches.

21:11.354 --> 21:14.649
We're less than 20 feet apart.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.485
You hear me?

21:16.735 --> 21:19.112
We're less than 20 feet apart.

21:22.449 --> 21:27.287
You big sissy,
you couldn't drive nails in a snow bank.

21:27.496 --> 21:29.331
Why would I want to?

21:29.539 --> 21:33.293
You ready to give up
and admit I'm better than you are?

21:33.502 --> 21:35.003
What for?

21:37.088 --> 21:41.510
Because I'm gonna whup you.

21:41.718 --> 21:44.346
You're pretty handy with your mouth,
Shame.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.723
Much more so than with your fists.

21:50.060 --> 21:52.604
Oh, no! No, spare me, Batman.

21:52.813 --> 21:55.106
I ain't nearly, nearly as ornery
as I ought to be.

21:55.315 --> 21:58.360
- Boo!
-Oh, don't! Don't! Don't do that, Batman.

21:58.568 --> 22:00.612
Stand up, Shame.

22:00.821 --> 22:03.865
You're not worthy of the name Shame.
You're a sham, Shame.

22:04.074 --> 22:07.202
Don't ever cry on my tights
or pull my leg again.

23:07.721 --> 23:09.973
On your feet, Shame.

23:11.641 --> 23:15.645
Shame, I look at you
with a mixture of emotions.

23:15.854 --> 23:18.607
Sympathy and disgust.

23:18.815 --> 23:23.278
You're heading for the last roundup, Shame,
because of your greed and your avarice.

23:23.528 --> 23:28.617
Otherwise, you might have realized that good,
even though it's sometimes sidetracked...

23:28.825 --> 23:33.496
...always, repeat, always triumphs over evil.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.044
You were magnificent, Batman.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.463
That was some shoot-out
on that deserted street.

23:41.796 --> 23:43.840
Some shoot-out without guns,
commissioner.

23:44.049 --> 23:47.928
Shame had a gun, and the way you flicked it
out of his hand was brilliant.

23:48.136 --> 23:52.140
It reminded me of that great old movie,
Low <i>Midnight</i> or something.

23:52.682 --> 23:56.645
It's all in a day's crime-fighting. Have you heard
from Warden Crichton, commissioner?

23:56.853 --> 23:59.189
Shame's back pitching horseshoes
in the prison yard.

23:59.397 --> 24:00.899
But this time, rubber horseshoes.

24:01.107 --> 24:04.486
And Calamity Jan and Frontier Fanny
are on police detail.

24:04.694 --> 24:06.321
- Police detail'?
-Police detail'?

24:06.529 --> 24:09.240
Policing up the cells
in the women's cell block, that is.

24:09.449 --> 24:13.203
At last, maybe things will get back
to normal around here.

24:13.745 --> 24:15.455
Normal, Chief O'Hara?

24:15.664 --> 24:20.961
<i>With that famed Yale professor of Egyptology
back in his King Tut alter ego...</i>

24:21.169 --> 24:24.673
<i>...escaping from a Gotham City Prison's
psychiatrist's couch...</i>

24:24.881 --> 24:30.303
...to <i>begin another cunning caper
calculated to confound our Terrific Trio?</i>

24:30.512 --> 24:32.055
<i>Watch the next episode...</i>

24:32.263 --> 24:37.727
<i>...to see just how normal
things are not going to be in Gotham City.</i>
