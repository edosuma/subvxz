to college...

13:03.253 --> 13:06.004

Well, we've got these
workshops here, man.

13:07.712 --> 13:09.712
You should move your ass
in here. We have a spot.
Yes.

13:09.712 --> 13:13.712
No, I mean, like,
what if I could be

13:13.712 --> 13:16.962

Yeah, like Benjamin Button.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.295
Yeah, I mean like

Mmm.

13:19.295 --> 13:21.545

Sauna. Martini.
Next time!

Ah. Hot sauna party.
Sounds pretty good.

his dick to his dad's?

It's not just the comparing.
It's also cleanliness, smegma.

24:17.795 --> 24:19.795
Yeah.
Who wants to deal with that?

24:19.795 --> 24:22.336
