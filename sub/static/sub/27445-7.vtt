WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:04.004
(rhythmic snapping)

00:06.040 --> 00:08.209
Better Things, all new.
Thursdays at 10:00.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.744
Starts February 28 on FX.

00:13.214 --> 00:16.350
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:28.929 --> 00:32.300
* Why am I hiding? *

00:35.569 --> 00:37.871
* Why don't I speak? *

00:41.909 --> 00:45.946
* What am I waiting for? *

00:45.979 --> 00:47.881
(giggles)

00:52.820 --> 00:55.456
-How you feeling?
-Good.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.458
You sure you're okay
he's coming?

00:57.491 --> 01:01.095
I'm not angry anymore.

01:01.129 --> 01:04.398
I think it might even
be good to see him.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.100
Good.

01:09.002 --> 01:12.273
* We float, we're floating *

01:12.306 --> 01:16.043
* Why can't I let *

01:16.076 --> 01:18.279
* Myself out? *

01:21.115 --> 01:24.252
What's your end-of-life plan?

01:24.285 --> 01:26.387
Easy, toss me off something.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.788
Huh?

01:27.821 --> 01:29.457
I want to know
how it feels to fly.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.492
-Oh...
-Ooh. Or sex murder me.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.262
Yeah, scratch that.
Sex murder me for sure.

01:34.295 --> 01:37.565
I'll be on Nancy Grace 24/7,
a nation will mourn.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.168
Don't let Ron Howard's daughter
play me in the movie.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.602
We have beef.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.437
I want to be cremated,

01:43.471 --> 01:47.841
with my ashes kept for eternity
in an urn on your mantel.

01:47.875 --> 01:51.011
You may remarry,
just no one sexier than me.

01:51.044 --> 01:53.514
The one exception
being Mark Ruffalo.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.915
Fair enough.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.751
Mm. Mm...

01:57.785 --> 02:01.088
(grunts)
Actually, I'm pretty tired.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.123
Oh, okay.

02:03.157 --> 02:06.126
Okay, good night.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.096
It's just that...

02:09.129 --> 02:12.933
uh, we've-we've sort of created
an expectation

02:12.966 --> 02:15.102
where we do sex whenever

02:15.135 --> 02:17.371
-one of us wants it.
-And yet I'm still tired.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.173
-Are you mad about the florist?
-I'm fine.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.309
-I want to make it up to you.
-Don't bother.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.777
-You can't.
-How can we make it even?

02:23.811 --> 02:26.146
Do you want to sock me
in the face? I'm extra bruisey,

02:26.180 --> 02:28.649
so you'll get to relish
the effects for weeks.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.651
There's nothing you can do
about getting your dick sucked.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.553
I could suck a dick.
(chuckles)

02:32.586 --> 02:34.322
To even it out.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.325
Like those "take a penny,
leave a penny" cups.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.361
Make it a zero-blowjob
sum gain for me.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.896
Sounds fair. You do that.
Suck a dick, Jimmy.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.633
-(chuckles)
-No, I'm serious.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.202
Suck a dick.
Suck a dick!

02:48.236 --> 02:50.738
Alternately...

02:50.771 --> 02:52.773
just let me be mad.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.852
* I'm gonna leave you anyway *

03:04.885 --> 03:07.888
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

03:07.921 --> 03:10.524
* Gonna leave you anyway. *

03:14.562 --> 03:17.931
Next, we have examples of some
of our most popular fillings.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.767
Uh, butterscotch-cream cheese,

03:19.800 --> 03:23.070
almond ganache, lemon curd,
Earl Grey medley,

03:23.103 --> 03:26.540
apricot jam,
kiwi-pistachio buttercream.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.409
Hey, you wouldn't think kiwi
and pistachio

03:28.442 --> 03:32.145
would go well together,
and yet, they don't.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.549
-So when's the big day?
-June 9.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.785
-(laughs) Six-nine. Nice.
-Sex number.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.120
They get it. What about you?

03:40.153 --> 03:41.355
We're already married. Shh.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.457
QUINN: We got totally
caught up in the hype

03:43.491 --> 03:45.426
and spent way too much money
on our wedding.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.927
Our ring bearer
was an actual bear.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.596
Deep-sixed
our finances for years.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.097
RACHEL: So we stick it to
the wedding-industrial complex

03:50.130 --> 03:52.132
whenever we can.
It feels so good.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.134
Yeah. Rachel has
a personality disorder.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.136
I shoplift. I mean, I used to.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.905
So scamming free cakes
or menu tastings

03:57.938 --> 03:59.940
really scratches the itch.

03:59.973 --> 04:03.277
It's our third tasting
of the day. Quinn is in AA.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.978
Micro-transgressions
make drinking

04:05.012 --> 04:06.480
fucking seltzer water tolerable.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.549
-(both laugh)
-I love shoplifting.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.418
I basically stole
this whole outfit.

04:10.451 --> 04:13.654
-And Jimmy's a total alcoholic.
-Hmm?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.122
Hey, if you guys want our help
gaming the system,

04:15.155 --> 04:16.990
we could save you a buck or two.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.127
We have low to no morals, so we
would be totally up for that.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.729
Great.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.297
-QUINN: Hi.
-RACHEL: Oh, hi. Yes.

04:23.331 --> 04:26.133
Jimmy, we're gonna
have couple friends.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.101
The hardest of passes.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.770
Couple friends, Jimmy.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.772
All married people
need couple friends.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.241
It's a must-have.
Couple friends.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.743
Stop saying "couple friends."

04:35.776 --> 04:37.345
We are not going to have...

04:37.378 --> 04:40.748
-Couple friends!
-(laughter)

04:40.781 --> 04:41.982
Thank you so much
for having us over, you guys.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.917
Oh, we love wine hangs
on the patio.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.118
We have never done this once.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.521
Why not?
You have a gorgeous view.

04:47.555 --> 04:50.123
-We do?
-Do we? Hmm.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.326
Here is our wedding binder.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.828
The orange tabs
are the easiest places to scam.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.130
Purple means you can get
actual cash out of them.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.767
DJs, photographers, flowers.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.704
We may actually be in the market
for a new florist. Right, Jimmy?

05:03.737 --> 05:04.972
RACHEL:
Venues.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.341
-Very cool.
-I'm glad we could do this.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.843
Hey, how are you guys?

05:09.877 --> 05:11.845
-Shh.
-Oh, they can't hear us.

05:11.879 --> 05:15.115
We're not really
even here anymore. Watch.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.018
I don't believe
in the Holocaust.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.853
-So, example...
-I like that
you can smoke there.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.289
Huh. Huh. Let me try.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.226
Um, Gretchen, you eat your butt,

05:26.259 --> 05:28.662
and farts from your butt.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.399
Oh...
(chuckles)

05:31.432 --> 05:33.233
So, why'd you ask
about me and Gretchen?

05:33.266 --> 05:36.003
Oh, well, planning a wedding
can be stressful.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.139
Also, because of the little
thing with the florist.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.809
(laughs) Rachel and Gretchen
have been texting.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.211
So I gather privacy goes out
the window with couple friends?

05:44.244 --> 05:47.581
Jimmy, you have
no secrets anymore. (chuckles)

05:47.615 --> 05:50.083
-Fantastic.
-But seriously,

05:50.117 --> 05:52.886
if you ever need someone
to listen, I'm here.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.322
Okay, Michael Messner,
sociologist and proponent

05:55.355 --> 05:58.826
of more emotional elasticity
in traditional masculine roles.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.994
I know, I know.
I'm a big old softy.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.596
AA will do that to you.

06:02.630 --> 06:06.434
Never stop drinking, Jimmy.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.901
It's horrible.

06:10.137 --> 06:13.674
Man, I would love
to come out here

06:13.707 --> 06:16.043
and fly my drone over
the reservoir sometime.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.045
Oh, I have a drone, too.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.847
(chuckles)
Well, had.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.116
They really should put a "Return
Home" button on the controls.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.152
They do.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.023
Ah. What do you know?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.258
-Mm-hmm.
-(laughs)

06:37.097 --> 06:40.968
So, um, what did Gretchen
tell Rachel about the, uh,

06:41.001 --> 06:45.539
you know, t-the time I let
someone else fly my drone?

06:45.573 --> 06:48.141
Was she upset about the flight?

06:48.175 --> 06:51.078
Because she's been
cagey about it.

06:51.111 --> 06:54.347
Well, how would you feel
if someone flew her drone?

06:57.451 --> 07:00.120
So this place,
these are the photographers.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.155
-(drone whirring)
-This is the whole section
of photographers.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.557
This guy is hot, he's good,

07:03.591 --> 07:05.092
-he's passionate...
-(bushes rustle)

07:10.097 --> 07:13.467
They're so cool.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.302
Do you think she likes me?

07:15.335 --> 07:17.571
I think she likes me.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.508
Why are you quiet?
Does she not like me?

07:20.541 --> 07:22.142
Goddamn it.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.945
Of course she did.
Who wouldn't like you?

07:30.150 --> 07:31.585
So you talked
to Rachel about it.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.086
-About what?
-It. The florist thing.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.756
Yet you won't
talk to me about it.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.691
-No.
-But you talked
to Rachel about it.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.092
-We're friends.
-She told Quinn.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.328
-They're married.
-And Quinn told me she told him.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.596
Seems like you've
cracked the case

07:42.630 --> 07:44.197
of who knows what, Dr. Dolittle.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.766
Dr. Dolittle talked to animals.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.201
Dr. House.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.872
You should be happy for me
getting a female friend!

07:51.905 --> 07:54.675
I get nervous just texting her
because I just know

07:54.708 --> 07:56.677
I'm gonna say something
that will make her hate me.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.446
So yes, I open up to her,

07:59.479 --> 08:03.283
like girls are supposed to do,
and it's actually working.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.619
So you should be
goddamn happy for me!

08:05.653 --> 08:08.388
Hey.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.857
Are you okay?

08:09.890 --> 08:13.026
Do you need to up
your medication dosage, maybe?

08:15.763 --> 08:17.565
You got a blowjob

08:17.598 --> 08:19.967
from a vendor for our wedding.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.003
Okay. Then let's talk about it.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.073
No. I told you. Suck a dick,
or leave me alone about it.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.577
Okay, but really...
what can I do?

08:29.610 --> 08:32.245
I am dead serious.
You're right.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.348
That's the only way
to make things even.

08:35.382 --> 08:39.219
Put a dick in your mouth
and suck on it.

08:39.252 --> 08:42.690
Let me know
when you've done that.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.862
(doorbell rings)

08:53.533 --> 08:54.868
Hey.

08:54.902 --> 08:58.538
-Hey, girl.
-(laughs): Come in.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.440
Dope place.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.610
Thanks. It's a flip.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.812
Well, I am flipping for it.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.681
Cookies!

09:07.715 --> 09:08.882
Thanks.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.618
Such a good idea
to do solo hangs.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.186
I know. Couple friends,
solo style.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.888
Also, I can't be
around Jimmy right now.

09:14.922 --> 09:18.458
-Still?
-Ugh, I don't know.
It's not his fault.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.060
Getting his dick sucked
isn't his fault?

09:20.093 --> 09:22.730
No, that was. Totally.
That was scummy.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.431
I just mean that's not, like...

09:24.464 --> 09:26.834
all of it, you know?

09:28.769 --> 09:32.472
Anyways, let's talk about
literally anything else.

09:32.505 --> 09:36.043
Um, rhubarb! Homemade soap!
Feminist porn!

09:36.076 --> 09:37.778
-The gig economy!
-Bowling!

09:37.811 --> 09:39.647
Costa Rica! Doughnuts!

09:39.680 --> 09:41.248
-Alcohol?
-Ladybugs!

09:41.281 --> 09:42.650
No, I'm asking do you want
some alcohol?

09:42.683 --> 09:44.317
Oh, God, yes.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.621
I hope we didn't force
this solo hang on the boys.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.991
You think they like each other
as much as we do?

09:51.024 --> 09:53.026
Impossible.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.233
Why in God's name
did I put it out there?

10:00.267 --> 10:03.470
I know Gretchen.
That was very foolish.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.338
She made me taste
my own ejaculate.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.776
-Yeah, I heard about that.
-Of course you did.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.478
-You were just making
a joke, right?
-Yes!

10:11.511 --> 10:13.947
Well, not a joke precisely.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.117
I was presenting the obvious
logical equivalent.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.519
I didn't think
she'd latch onto it.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.588
Do you know she hasn't
spoken to me since?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.290
Wait, am I even supposed
to tell you this?

10:23.323 --> 10:24.758
I don't know the rules.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.594
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
This is a tough one.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.462
You could just wait her out?

10:29.496 --> 10:31.298
Do you know
how disconcerting it is

10:31.331 --> 10:33.366
to live with someone
who will not talk to you?

10:33.400 --> 10:36.469
I just keep pretending
I'm Harvey Keitel in The Piano

10:36.503 --> 10:38.538
and Gretchen is a fetching mute.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.173
You could...

10:40.207 --> 10:44.344
you know... do it.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.347
What? No, no.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.818
No, I can't... I couldn't...
I-I can't do that.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.553
I know, but, I mean,

10:53.586 --> 10:55.322
it is just skin.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.658
Attached to a disgusting,
hairy, male man.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.660
-Wait, you haven't ever?
-No.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.031
Uh... I mean, maybe.

11:04.064 --> 11:07.300
I used to black out a lot.
But, look,

11:07.334 --> 11:09.302
it's not that big a deal.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.205
It might even be interesting,
experientially speaking.

11:12.239 --> 11:15.208
-I do enjoy new experiences.
-Uh-huh.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.377
Though, generally ones
with less immediate proximity

11:17.410 --> 11:19.346
-to testicles.
-Mm-hmm.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.749
No, look, even if I could S a D,

11:21.782 --> 11:23.751
where would I find
the D to S?

11:23.784 --> 11:25.652
A dating app.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.822
My brother uses
this one all the time.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.690
He lets me help him pick dudes.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.692
And you can basically
order anything.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.262
It's like Postmates for penis.
Check it out.

11:35.295 --> 11:38.098
You can see what each guy
is down for right here.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.566
Here's one!

11:39.599 --> 11:43.937
This guy is willing to host
and he's looking for oral ASAP.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.373
-Well, he looks pleasant enough.
-Mm-hmm.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.708
-Like a small-town veterinarian.
-Yeah.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.177
Or the first soldier

11:50.210 --> 11:52.512
-to die in a war movie. Yeah.
-Yes.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.281
-Let's make your profile.
-Oh, okay.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.283
Uh, wait, wait. Um...

11:57.951 --> 11:59.119
(shutter clicks)

11:59.152 --> 12:02.689
Very nice.
Now look like a rough boy.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.157
Oh.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.896
Mm, maybe go back
to the duck lips.

12:08.929 --> 12:12.299
Just a little aggressive.
There we go.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.568
You can't help
but to start to imagine

12:15.602 --> 12:17.704
this entire personality

12:17.737 --> 12:20.440
and childhood and college essays

12:20.473 --> 12:22.109
for this thing that's
living inside of you,

12:22.142 --> 12:23.977
even though you know
you're not supposed to.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.246
How can you help it?

12:26.279 --> 12:29.582
Anyway, so that
was hard to get over.

12:29.616 --> 12:34.421
Not sure I am yet.
I know I'm gun-shy to try again.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.624
-Right. Totally.
-So...

12:37.657 --> 12:39.126
how about you?

12:39.159 --> 12:41.661
Oh, yeah, no, nothing like that.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.764
I cut myself trying to trim
my pubes once, so I get it.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.400
I mean, do you guys
want children?

12:47.434 --> 12:51.271
Oh, uh... Shit.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.607
Babies... I don't know.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.810
I like them when they're
dressed up like animals,

12:56.844 --> 12:59.179
but I don't yet
totally know if I...

12:59.212 --> 13:01.849
You don't know if you want
to be a mom? Totally normal.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.284
Oh, no, I want it.
I was gonna say "should."

13:04.317 --> 13:06.353
I don't know if I should be a...

13:08.355 --> 13:11.258
Do you want to... Do you want me
to put on some music?

13:11.291 --> 13:14.694
I have a mental thing.
Uh... whatchamacallit,

13:14.727 --> 13:17.164
clinical depression.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.269
-Sorry.
-No.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.171
Sorry, I'm sorry.
Um, I'm just flinchy.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.439
-I want a hug.
-It's okay.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.542
Hey, in fact...
(chuckles) let's hug

13:29.576 --> 13:33.146
as soon as I go pee-pee
in your toilet.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.182
Then we're gonna hug
like motherfuckers.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.027
(phone chimes)

13:47.060 --> 13:51.331
He says his door is unlocked.

13:51.364 --> 13:54.201
It's go time. You got this.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.869
Easy peasy.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.638
Mouthwash, gum,
antibacterial wipes.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.407
Stash it in a bush.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.110
Remember, this is for your lady.
It's just skin.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.524
You got this!

14:21.861 --> 14:23.596
Hello.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.398
MAN:
Hello.

14:25.432 --> 14:29.602
Oh. There you are.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.008
Got a lovely,
lovely house. Books!

14:35.042 --> 14:37.044
Very nice.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.445
I don't know this neighborhood.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.248
Seems to have a high
walkability rating.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.517
Shh. Take off your shirt.

14:44.551 --> 14:48.021
Ah. Okay.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.456
Just like that.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.092
Decisive.
Good on you, mate.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.168
(exhales)

15:02.635 --> 15:04.804
I'm a little nervous.
You see, this is my...

15:04.837 --> 15:05.872
Can you stop talking?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.808
Right, yeah, okay, okay.

15:08.841 --> 15:12.145
Silencio, por favor.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.081
I'll just-I'll just
get at it then.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.082
Um...

15:15.115 --> 15:17.817
Could you make it a little sexy?

15:17.850 --> 15:20.954
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah,
well, I plan to.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.504
Yeah, it's lovely.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.906
Oh, you like that?
You like that?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.141
See, I do not work out,

15:41.174 --> 15:43.476
like, in a traditional sense,

15:43.510 --> 15:45.812
but I have a top-notch
calisthenics routine--

15:45.845 --> 15:48.748
yeah, the name of which
is derived

15:48.781 --> 15:50.850
from Callisthenes of Olynthus.

15:50.883 --> 15:54.421
Fun fact, Aristotle
was his great uncle.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.955
Now, you might wonder...

15:55.989 --> 15:58.125
That was quick. How'd it go?

15:58.158 --> 16:00.793
-He disinvited me.
-What? Why?

16:00.827 --> 16:03.296
He accused me of being
a closeted virgin,

16:03.330 --> 16:05.132
and then I sort of
lunged at him awkwardly,

16:05.165 --> 16:06.499
fell into his leg,

16:06.533 --> 16:08.501
knocked over a picture puzzle
he'd been working on.

16:08.535 --> 16:09.702
He was livid.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.939
I mean, his attitude at the end
was a real turnoff.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.141
(phone chimes)

16:14.174 --> 16:16.509
He gave you zero eggplants.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.046
Zero?! How dare he!

16:19.079 --> 16:20.980
Well, in retaliation,
I shall give him...

16:21.014 --> 16:23.883
-(phone chimes)
-Uh, you can't. He blocked you.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.021
Where's your shirt?

16:28.055 --> 16:30.690
(gasps)

16:42.202 --> 16:44.404
(toilet flushes)

17:00.553 --> 17:03.356
(mouthing)

17:13.466 --> 17:15.202
What are you doing?

17:15.235 --> 17:18.004
Nothing. I was just seeing
if you had a cat.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.140
Do you have a cat?
Because I couldn't find one.

17:21.774 --> 17:24.411
Oh, the comb. I was thinking
of getting one of these,

17:24.444 --> 17:26.646
and I wanted to know
if it could fit in my bra.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.417
Why, are you accusing me
of stealing?

17:30.450 --> 17:34.053
That is really messed up of you,
Rachel. Projecting much?

17:34.087 --> 17:35.722
-(laughs)
-What?

17:35.755 --> 17:37.790
Why are you laughing at me?

17:37.824 --> 17:41.428
This is my absolute favorite
part of a new friendship.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.296
When the real comes out.

17:48.335 --> 17:51.304
Listen, Gretchen,
here's how it is with me.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.806
I don't let just anyone in.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.477
But I don't lose people, so...

17:57.510 --> 18:01.548
once you're in,
you're in for life.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.583
(stifled laugh)

18:08.688 --> 18:12.125
(sobs softly)

18:12.159 --> 18:14.261
But, seriously, I am gonna need
my grandmother's comb back.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.068
(crying softly)

18:22.101 --> 18:23.670
-QUINN: What are you gonna do?
-JIMMY: Eh.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.806
Just live a sexless existence
next to a prickly, mute,

18:26.839 --> 18:28.908
redheaded ball
of anger and recrimination

18:28.941 --> 18:30.743
until she eventually leaves me.

18:30.777 --> 18:35.248
Or enact some far worse revenge
gleaned from countless hours

18:35.282 --> 18:37.150
spent watching Snapped,

18:37.184 --> 18:40.687
in which women finally,
you know, snap.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.855
Fuck this.
You can't give up.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.258
Let's go to the West Hollywood
bars. I'll wingman you.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.861
Oh, forget it. I clearly
can't S a stranger's D.

18:48.895 --> 18:52.732
I'd have to at least be
comfortable with the guy, or...

19:06.746 --> 19:07.747
(chuckles)

19:43.750 --> 19:45.718
(water running)

19:45.752 --> 19:47.754
(water stops)

19:51.224 --> 19:53.192
I did it.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.162
-Did what?
-The thing you told me to do.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.698
I did it.
I did the thing.

19:58.731 --> 20:03.102
-I did it.
-Jimmy. Wait.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.505
Whoa, what?

20:05.538 --> 20:08.040
Jimmy.
Jimmy?

20:08.074 --> 20:10.076
-Jimmy!
-(chuckles)

20:10.109 --> 20:14.347
(gasps) What are you...?
What? Who?

20:14.381 --> 20:18.017
-Quinn.
-(gasps) What? What?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.619
What is happening?

20:19.652 --> 20:23.256
Oh, my God. You...

20:23.290 --> 20:26.626
Jimmy!
(muffled scream)

20:26.659 --> 20:30.263
What the actual fuck?!

20:30.297 --> 20:33.266
Oh, my God!

20:33.300 --> 20:35.101
You...

20:35.134 --> 20:37.370
you sucked a dick for me.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.940
I say "S'd a D."
It's classier.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.976
Wait. Oh, no.
But Rachel...

20:44.010 --> 20:46.212
Oh, no, no. It's fine. He called
her right before he left.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.281
She thought it was hilarious.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.216
Really? Seriously?

20:50.249 --> 20:53.119
Ooh.
Okay, then.

20:53.152 --> 20:56.923
So... we're good?

20:56.956 --> 20:58.925
Yes, Jimmy.
We're good.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.828
I mean, I was just trying
to get you off my back.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.297
-What?
-Nothing. You did it for me.

21:04.331 --> 21:07.133
Mm. I love you for that.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.271
By the way, they're coming over
for dinner tomorrow night.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.673
Try not to drop your fork

21:13.706 --> 21:15.408
and accidentally
suck his dick again.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.009
(laughs)

21:21.280 --> 21:23.450
To making connections.

21:23.483 --> 21:26.319
To the serendipity of meeting
you guys at that cake tasting,

21:26.353 --> 21:29.589
and to always being open
to new experiences.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.257
RACHEL:
To letting people in.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.660
And to the lengths
our husbands will go

21:33.693 --> 21:35.828
to make us happy.
(laughs)

21:35.862 --> 21:38.197
Oh, well. If it was good enough
for Oscar Wilde

21:38.230 --> 21:40.867
and Tennessee Williams
and Truman Capote

21:40.900 --> 21:42.602
and James Baldwin...

21:42.635 --> 21:46.105
Okay, most of my favorite
male writers, actually.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.640
To friends for life.

21:47.674 --> 21:48.875
JIMMY and RACHEL:
For life.

21:52.178 --> 21:55.615
RACHEL (echoing):
I don't let just anyone in...

21:55.648 --> 21:59.151
but I don't lose people. Once
you're in, you're in for life.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.721
For life!

22:01.754 --> 22:04.491
I don't lose people.
You're in for life.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.559
For life. For life.
You're in for life.

22:06.593 --> 22:09.696
You're in for life.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.698
Jimmy, what are you guys
talking about?

22:11.731 --> 22:13.900
What?

22:13.933 --> 22:15.535
The blowjob.
(chuckles)

22:15.568 --> 22:19.338
Gretchen, the, uh... Jimmy?

22:19.372 --> 22:21.073
You did know about the...

22:21.107 --> 22:23.342
Blowjob?
You didn't put your...

22:23.376 --> 22:24.711
you had his...

22:24.744 --> 22:27.714
your m-mouth, Jimmy?

22:27.747 --> 22:30.850
-What are you doing?
-Wait, you didn't tell her?

22:30.883 --> 22:34.253
Gretchen, it's not a big deal.
It was all for... Wait.

22:34.286 --> 22:36.556
-Gretchen!
-Not one more word!

22:36.589 --> 22:38.825
I thought you told me
that she wanted him to.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.894
You thought I wanted my husband
to suck your husband's dick?

22:41.928 --> 22:44.397
That's what he told me.
That's what he told me.

22:44.431 --> 22:47.434
-That's what you...
What the fuck, Jimmy?
-Oh, my God.

22:47.467 --> 22:50.002
No! No, no, no, no.
I d... I didn't want to.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.839
Gretchen, tell her.
Tell her.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.607
Did you make up
that she said that

22:54.641 --> 22:56.443
just to get me
to let you do that?

22:56.476 --> 22:58.845
Why would I say that?!

22:58.878 --> 23:00.613
I think you guys should go!

23:00.647 --> 23:02.449
Yes, I think we should.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.356
(door opens, closes)

23:10.389 --> 23:13.693
What the hell was that?

23:13.726 --> 23:15.628
Eh, she was too much for me.

23:18.498 --> 23:21.468
Anyways, all this talk of BJs...

23:21.501 --> 23:23.736
I need it now.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.172
Hmm-hmm.

23:29.809 --> 23:32.078
Well, okay.

23:36.449 --> 23:40.219
* These seven words *

23:40.252 --> 23:43.956
* I say to you *

23:43.990 --> 23:48.828
* One by one *

23:48.861 --> 23:51.063
* I love you *

23:51.097 --> 23:54.467
* And you have to know *

23:57.136 --> 23:58.137
(whispers):
Edgar.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.473
* If I could change *

24:00.507 --> 24:01.941
