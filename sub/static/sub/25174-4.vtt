00:02.313 --> 00:06.282
Look at that bump. Congratulations.

00:06.350 --> 00:09.093
- Thank you.
- I hope that's decaf.

00:09.162 --> 00:12.363
- It is.
- Looking good, mama-to-be.

00:12.432 --> 00:14.718
But it's time
for some maternity clothes.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.833
You don't want to squish the baby.

00:17.578 --> 00:19.140
Sure don't.

00:19.172 --> 00:21.606
Hey, sorry that took so long,
but you know the rules.

00:21.675 --> 00:23.308
I go to the grocery store,
I get a treat.

00:23.376 --> 00:24.976
And the lady saw you were pregnant,

00:25.045 --> 00:26.811
so I got a free pretzel.

00:27.041 --> 00:28.607
Hey, I noticed you got cat litter.

00:28.632 --> 00:29.928
You should get rid of your cat.

00:29.953 --> 00:31.216
They have parasites in their poo

00:31.284 --> 00:32.784
that could eat your baby's brain.

00:33.179 --> 00:34.982
Oh, thanks for the tip, bro.

00:35.007 --> 00:38.289
Wow, people are so helpful
when you're pregnant.

00:38.358 --> 00:39.791
Hey, babe, door?

00:48.268 --> 00:50.935
Welcome, my dazzling divas.

00:51.004 --> 00:52.904
Are you ladies familiar
with Bishop and Boo?

00:52.973 --> 00:56.441
It's the world's third-largest
direct-sales cosmetics company.

00:56.510 --> 00:58.810
I'd love to get you acquainted.

00:58.879 --> 01:01.713
- Are you ill?
- No, I'm broke.

01:01.781 --> 01:03.882
I had to lease my horse, Passing Fancy,

01:03.950 --> 01:06.417
to a third grader, and
she rides Western, not English.

01:06.486 --> 01:08.085
It's been a nightmare.

01:09.256 --> 01:11.456
So now I'm selling the finest

01:11.525 --> 01:13.306
wholesale cosmetics on the market.

01:13.331 --> 01:18.366
And if I move enough product,
I get a white Jetta!

01:19.799 --> 01:22.865
So who wants a makeover? Chelsea?

01:22.890 --> 01:24.802
I don't buy suburban-housewife makeup.

01:24.871 --> 01:27.005
I wear classy makeup, like MAC.

01:29.943 --> 01:31.843
Cecelia, are you eating a ginger root?

01:31.912 --> 01:32.977
Yeah.

01:33.046 --> 01:34.746
I haven't had time to cook lately,

01:34.814 --> 01:36.748
and they don't have any vegan
options on the cafeteria.

01:36.816 --> 01:38.917
So I just grabbed this on the way out.

01:38.985 --> 01:40.251
It's gross.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.786
Why don't you just flavor trip?

01:42.061 --> 01:44.092
- What's that?
- It's this hot new trend

01:44.117 --> 01:45.390
where you take a pill and it makes

01:45.458 --> 01:46.875
disgusting food taste good.

01:46.900 --> 01:50.268
Seriously, you drink vinegar,
and it tastes like grape juice.

01:50.786 --> 01:52.710
That's how I got down to a size 0.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.648
And I am a size zero.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.232
- Stop looking at me.
- Oh, I'll have to get some.

02:01.257 --> 02:03.341
- Oh, I've got some.
- Oh, not that one.

02:03.410 --> 02:05.009
That's for something else.

02:05.078 --> 02:07.312
- Good morning, Deb...
- No, it's not.

02:07.380 --> 02:11.082
I've got insane heartburn from
an ice cream and sardine binge,

02:11.151 --> 02:14.485
my butthole's pumping more gas
than the Alaskan pipeline,

02:14.554 --> 02:16.351
and I have Shrek feet.

02:16.656 --> 02:18.156
This pregnancy crap's overwhelming.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.791
Why don't you join a mommy group?

02:19.859 --> 02:21.392
That way, you can
share your frustrations

02:21.461 --> 02:23.375
with other women who are
going through the same thing.

02:23.570 --> 02:26.225
Maybe, as long as they don't
call me a mommy.

02:26.250 --> 02:27.899
Might I suggest making a good impression

02:27.968 --> 02:30.568
on your new friends with some
"Won't Fade With The Day"

02:30.637 --> 02:32.476
eyeliner in emerald mist?

02:33.666 --> 02:35.022
Get a life.

02:35.709 --> 02:38.142
Sorry, Ian, but when your grades slip,

02:38.211 --> 02:39.577
and you bring a honeydew melon

02:39.646 --> 02:41.312
from home to throw at your classmates,

02:41.381 --> 02:43.248
your mom and dad get called in.

02:43.316 --> 02:45.049
Them's the rules.

02:45.118 --> 02:47.952
- Ms. Bennigan?
- Oh, Mr. Mund, hi.

02:48.021 --> 02:49.754
- You can call me Lonny.
- It's nice to meet you.

02:49.823 --> 02:51.689
You too. Hey, bud.

02:51.758 --> 02:53.825
Ian, would you mind
stepping out for a sec

02:53.893 --> 02:55.927
so we can have a grown-up powwow?

02:55.996 --> 02:58.162
- Sure.
- Okay, I love you.

02:58.231 --> 03:00.546
Please have a seat.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.500
Uh, where's Mrs. Mund?

03:02.569 --> 03:04.202
Oh, probably picking up her human suit

03:04.271 --> 03:06.789
from the dry cleaner's so
no one knows she's the devil.

03:08.406 --> 03:09.540
I don't know if Ian told you,

03:09.609 --> 03:10.908
but we are going through a divorce.

03:10.977 --> 03:12.744
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

03:12.812 --> 03:14.946
That probably explains
why he's falling behind.

03:15.015 --> 03:18.116
Yeah, the custody dispute
has been a total nightmare,

03:18.184 --> 03:20.652
thanks to my harpy, Medusa wife.

03:22.055 --> 03:23.087
Sorry.

03:24.093 --> 03:25.723
Why don't we just call her Paula?

03:26.007 --> 03:27.914
Sure. "Paula."

03:28.461 --> 03:30.498
You see, Ian is adopted,

03:30.523 --> 03:32.497
and since it was Paula's initial idea,

03:32.565 --> 03:34.265
she's been using that as leverage

03:34.334 --> 03:35.466
to try and get full custody.

03:35.535 --> 03:37.235
I wasn't aware he was adopted.

03:37.304 --> 03:40.104
Chechnya.
Lovely people, but what a dump.

03:40.173 --> 03:42.140
The whole place smells like fish.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.008
You know, I have a question for you.

03:44.077 --> 03:46.044
Do you think that Ian needs a tutor?

03:46.112 --> 03:49.147
Oh, no, I don't think that's necessary.

03:49.215 --> 03:52.450
And it sounds like you've got
a lot on your plate as is.

03:52.519 --> 03:54.919
Tell you what,
I'll give Ian a little extra

03:54.988 --> 03:58.523
one-on-one attention,
and you keep him away from...

03:58.591 --> 04:00.391
- My garbage wife.
- I was gonna say

04:00.460 --> 04:03.361
all the negativity.
Oh, same thing, but sure.

04:03.430 --> 04:05.096
Okay.

04:08.390 --> 04:09.934
Oh.

04:12.172 --> 04:14.172
Painting your nails? Me too.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.908
I'm using Bishop and Boo's
"No Chip, Look Hip"

04:16.976 --> 04:19.043
glossy nail polish in Persian pink.

04:19.112 --> 04:20.952
It lasts up to seven weeks.

04:22.949 --> 04:24.582
- Ms. Snap?
- Hmm?

04:24.651 --> 04:27.125
I can't go down the slide. It's full.

04:27.150 --> 04:28.281
What?

04:28.822 --> 04:30.154
Oh! Hi, Chelsea.

04:30.223 --> 04:32.076
I didn't expect to see you here.

04:32.101 --> 04:33.756
I'm just applying Bishop and Boo's

04:33.781 --> 04:37.028
all-natural "Spoil My Body"
butter chiffon creme.

04:37.097 --> 04:40.698
It boosts collagen and won't
leave my skin feeling oily.

04:42.515 --> 04:44.873
You are like the freakin' Babadook.

04:44.898 --> 04:46.137
What is wrong with you?

04:46.206 --> 04:48.506
I'll tell you
what's not wrong with me...

04:48.575 --> 04:50.475
dry, chapped lips.

04:50.543 --> 04:51.843
Thanks to Bishop and Boo's

04:51.911 --> 04:53.711
"Perfectly Plump Pout" lip balm,

04:53.780 --> 04:56.114
my lips are as soft as a seal's.

04:56.182 --> 04:58.649
Oh, my God, Caroline. Give it a rest.

04:58.718 --> 04:59.817
Okay, fine.

04:59.886 --> 05:01.853
I'm sorry I've been such a pest.

05:01.921 --> 05:04.055
I just figured that your face

05:04.124 --> 05:06.424
would be the perfect canvas
for the product.

05:06.757 --> 05:10.328
I mean, if people saw someone
as flawless as you

05:10.397 --> 05:13.297
wearing the makeup,
it would sell itself.

05:13.366 --> 05:15.066
Well, that makes a lot of sense.

05:15.135 --> 05:17.268
A man who claimed he was
a model scout at the mall

05:17.337 --> 05:18.369
told me the same thing.

05:18.438 --> 05:20.238
So... does that mean

05:20.306 --> 05:22.540
I get to give you
a Bishop and Boo makeover?

05:22.609 --> 05:23.632
Sure.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.140
But only if you promise to put me

05:25.165 --> 05:27.726
on your professional
Facebook page and LinkedIn.

05:29.015 --> 05:30.982
LinkedIn is a perfect dating Website.

05:31.050 --> 05:32.884
I can literally search "CEO."

05:34.921 --> 05:37.855
So, mommies, we have
a new mommy in the group.

05:37.924 --> 05:40.725
Please help me welcome
Mrs. Deborah Adler.

05:40.794 --> 05:43.828
- It's just Deb.
- And I'm just Damien.

05:43.897 --> 05:46.063
I'm the husband. We're pregnant.

05:46.132 --> 05:48.399
Mm. Such a special time.

05:48.468 --> 05:51.101
Why don't you tell us all
about your birth plan?

05:51.148 --> 05:52.603
There isn't really a plan.

05:52.672 --> 05:54.071
I'm just gonna go to the hospital,

05:54.140 --> 05:56.741
get drugged up, and blast this baby out.

05:58.912 --> 06:00.546
You're not having a natural birth?

06:00.593 --> 06:02.780
No, I want all the drugs.

06:02.849 --> 06:05.082
Yeah, not all the drugs,
just the safe ones.

06:05.151 --> 06:07.485
Oh, there are no safe ones.
Isn't that right, Siobhan?

06:07.554 --> 06:10.121
Yeah, they're all dangerous.

06:10.190 --> 06:13.891
Deborah, this is a judgment-free zone,

06:13.960 --> 06:16.093
but your decision is terrible.

06:16.162 --> 06:18.863
Do you want your baby to be born high?

06:19.273 --> 06:21.420
I gave birth
to all of my children at home

06:21.445 --> 06:22.633
in our infinity hot tub.

06:22.702 --> 06:26.373
- They just floated right out.
- It was blissful.

06:26.398 --> 06:28.351
Yeah, I think
I'm good with the hospital.

06:28.376 --> 06:29.773
You're wrong!

06:30.310 --> 06:33.611
I'm sorry. Just because you've
chosen to harm your child

06:33.680 --> 06:35.079
doesn't mean I should be rude.

06:35.148 --> 06:37.898
Okay, I gave it a shot.
Let's go, Damien.

06:40.945 --> 06:42.171
Damien.

06:43.189 --> 06:45.890
Fine, but just know
if you get the epidural,

06:45.959 --> 06:47.625
you won't feel the orgasmic release

06:47.694 --> 06:49.794
of oxytocin as you crown!

06:51.731 --> 06:53.331
She heard me.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.257
Mmm.

06:58.225 --> 07:00.592
Mmm. Ahh.

07:01.234 --> 07:02.940
Thanks for letting me eat in here.

07:03.009 --> 07:05.109
Caroline banished me
from the teacher's lounge.

07:05.178 --> 07:07.545
She said the stench of my food
was impeding her sales.

07:07.614 --> 07:10.414
Yeah, I got to say, it's hard
to watch you eat this stuff.

07:10.483 --> 07:12.116
Oh, it's delicious.

07:12.185 --> 07:14.485
The horseradish tastes like dessert.

07:14.554 --> 07:15.653
Flavor tripping works.

07:17.423 --> 07:18.923
Ooh, got to go.

07:18.992 --> 07:20.291
Fourth grade lunch is over,

07:20.360 --> 07:22.026
and the lunch lady said I could have

07:22.095 --> 07:23.875
the leftover tater-tot grease.

07:27.007 --> 07:29.934
Oh, hello, Mrs. Mund.
It's so good to see you.

07:30.003 --> 07:31.669
Why did you tell my shrimp-dick husband

07:31.738 --> 07:32.803
to cancel the tutor?

07:32.872 --> 07:34.205
What? I didn't.

07:34.274 --> 07:36.908
Uh, you said the tutor
was "unnecessary,"

07:36.976 --> 07:39.677
so that walking dildo
canceled Ian's sessions,

07:39.746 --> 07:41.012
which I already paid for.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.481
I'm so sorry. I had no idea. I...

07:44.817 --> 07:46.083
Stay out of my family's business.

07:46.152 --> 07:47.418
I don't want your opinion

07:47.487 --> 07:49.484
unless you're my attorney or Raoul.

07:53.945 --> 07:55.507
You must be Raoul.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.439
Raoul!

08:02.802 --> 08:05.703
As a lactation expert,
I highly recommend

08:05.772 --> 08:07.338
you join La Leche League.

08:07.617 --> 08:10.942
It's a community that believes
the child should decide

08:11.010 --> 08:12.343
when breastfeeding ends.

08:12.412 --> 08:15.646
- Totally. We love that idea.
- Oh, do we?

08:15.715 --> 08:19.116
Sorry, but when does the child
usually decide to stop?

08:19.185 --> 08:22.242
Some breastfeed
for as long as 72 months.

08:22.507 --> 08:24.922
- Wow. That sounds awesome.
- Does it?

08:24.991 --> 08:26.657
'Cause, personally, I don't want to have

08:26.726 --> 08:28.392
a six-year-old feasting on my tits.

08:28.461 --> 08:31.562
It is important for
a child's psychological health

08:31.631 --> 08:33.664
that they decide when to wean.

08:34.116 --> 08:35.732
You don't want them to feel rejected.

08:35.802 --> 08:37.201
I got to say, Deb...

08:37.270 --> 08:38.970
all the breasts
I've been denied in my life,

08:39.038 --> 08:40.972
that really had an effect
on my self-esteem.

08:41.375 --> 08:42.953
We should think about this.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.610
I'll think about this,
because it'll be my nipples

08:45.678 --> 08:48.913
being gnawed on until the kid
gets their driver's license.

08:48.982 --> 08:51.242
My tits, my choice!

09:00.793 --> 09:02.793
Hey, Deb Adler here...

09:02.862 --> 09:05.596
fully preggers, and giving zero Fs.

09:05.665 --> 09:07.131
You know what I'm sick of?

09:07.200 --> 09:10.401
Everyone telling me what to do
with my pregnancy.

09:10.470 --> 09:12.937
Mommy groups, lactation coaches,

09:13.006 --> 09:16.474
blogs, books, magazines,
bowling alley attendants.

09:16.542 --> 09:18.075
It's endless.

09:18.144 --> 09:19.977
But just so all of you people

09:20.046 --> 09:22.146
who've given me advice
know you've been heard,

09:22.215 --> 09:24.203
I'm gonna respond
to each and every one of you.

09:24.851 --> 09:26.117
[BLEEP] you.

09:26.185 --> 09:28.419
[BLEEP] you. Go [BLEEP] yourself.

09:28.488 --> 09:31.489
Get [BLEEP]. And, Randy, [BLEEP] you.

09:31.726 --> 09:33.724
You wear a back brace when you bowl,

09:33.793 --> 09:35.476
you [BLEEP] asshole.

09:37.397 --> 09:40.665
All you mothers-to-be
out there, you do you.

09:40.733 --> 09:44.735
Be the rock stars you are
and tell everybody else

09:44.804 --> 09:47.872
to #LeggoMyPreggo.

09:49.075 --> 09:51.203
And upload.

09:53.133 --> 09:55.250
This foundation feels...

09:56.037 --> 09:57.703
- thick.
- It is.

09:57.757 --> 09:59.771
The matte liquid
fills in the deep creases.

10:01.773 --> 10:03.328
I mean fine lines.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.359
Very fine.

10:06.113 --> 10:08.814
And to complete
the Bishop and Boo new you,

10:08.883 --> 10:11.116
you can be the first to try
our just released

10:11.185 --> 10:13.318
"Aubergine Lengthen and Strengthen"

10:13.387 --> 10:15.721
eyelash lengthener with natural peptides

10:15.789 --> 10:18.093
to give you longer, fuller lashes.

10:18.289 --> 10:21.260
I don't want to brag, but
at the Romanian Cosmetics Expo,

10:21.328 --> 10:24.093
we totally handed Latisse
their ass on a plate.

10:24.431 --> 10:26.231
So it makes your eyelashes longer,

10:26.300 --> 10:28.934
and I won't have to recycle
my falsies every other week?

10:29.304 --> 10:30.969
- I'll buy one.
- Wonderful.

10:31.038 --> 10:34.006
That'll be a one-time payment
of just $45.99.

10:34.074 --> 10:36.942
- For mascara?
- It has peptides, Chelsea.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.492
Peptides. Fine.

10:42.650 --> 10:44.016
You see how easy that was?

10:44.234 --> 10:46.539
That mascara only cost $4 wholesale.

10:46.765 --> 10:49.054
Wait. You just flat out ripped me off?

10:49.123 --> 10:52.558
No, I sold you a product
at a retail markup price.

10:52.626 --> 10:54.927
You should consider
selling Bishop and Boo.

10:54.995 --> 10:57.930
If you sell enough in a year,
you get a white Jetta.

10:57.998 --> 11:00.299
And if you recruit
new brand ambassadors,

11:00.367 --> 11:02.546
you get a cut of every sale
they make, too.

11:03.085 --> 11:05.617
I could use some extra cash
for my nose job.

11:06.006 --> 11:07.973
Deviated septum procedure
which I desperately need

11:08.042 --> 11:09.312
in order to breathe.

11:10.978 --> 11:12.544
You know what? I'm in.

11:15.449 --> 11:17.783
I will have that white Jetta. I will.

11:19.286 --> 11:21.787
Now, I know this is none of my business,

11:21.855 --> 11:23.989
but Paula stopped by earlier...

11:24.058 --> 11:25.375
Did she bring Raoul?

11:25.926 --> 11:27.893
- Um...
- It's okay. You can tell me.

11:27.962 --> 11:29.127
I won't get mad.

11:29.375 --> 11:32.429
- Yes, Raoul was here.
- Damn it!

11:32.692 --> 11:33.791
What did he look like?

11:34.001 --> 11:35.701
What did he look like?

11:35.769 --> 11:37.603
- Swarthy.
- Like what?

11:37.671 --> 11:39.304
Like a sexy pirate?

11:39.726 --> 11:43.241
Admit it, he looked like a sexy pirate!

11:43.310 --> 11:46.845
I think he's just feeling
a little insecure about...

11:47.437 --> 11:48.529
Raoul.

11:48.554 --> 11:51.216
He went to strip clubs
having "business lunches"

11:51.285 --> 11:53.385
while I stayed home
taking care of our child.

11:53.454 --> 11:55.921
Oh, but now I'm not allowed
sexual fulfillment

11:55.990 --> 11:57.689
for the first time in my adult life?

11:57.758 --> 11:59.191
Who's side are you on?

11:59.259 --> 12:01.093
Listen, I was up for trying new things,

12:01.161 --> 12:04.296
but if the only way that she
can be "sexually fulfilled"

12:04.365 --> 12:07.466
is to put her fist up my...
my you-know-what,

12:07.534 --> 12:08.800
well, that is on her.

12:08.869 --> 12:10.365
Stop putting me in the middle!

12:10.390 --> 12:12.204
I just want you guys to get along!

12:12.272 --> 12:13.672
I don't want to have two separate

12:13.741 --> 12:15.574
parent/teacher conferences!

12:16.898 --> 12:19.945
- Deb, we saw your video.
- I carry a knife in my boot.

12:20.014 --> 12:23.148
Oh, no, no, it was amazing.

12:23.217 --> 12:26.385
It was so real, so raw, so exposed.

12:26.453 --> 12:30.589
You said what we all feel.
You have 40,000 views.

12:30.765 --> 12:32.029
- For real?
- Yeah.

12:32.054 --> 12:33.490
We are so tired of Honour

12:33.515 --> 12:35.896
and all of her judgmental
earth mama baloney.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.262
Yeah, she's pretty dogmatic.

12:37.331 --> 12:39.364
You should start your own mommy group.

12:39.433 --> 12:40.766
We'd join.

12:40.834 --> 12:42.934
Oh, my God, please.

12:43.003 --> 12:44.646
- We hate Honour.
- Mm.

12:44.671 --> 12:47.973
She makes us stick
essential oils up our vaginas.

12:48.042 --> 12:50.575
- And she checks.
- Oh.

12:54.945 --> 12:56.181
Guess what.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.517
I already recruited
two new brand ambassadors.

12:58.585 --> 13:01.820
- Wow. That's amazing.
- Ms. Snap, it worked.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.822
All the homely girls
are buying the makeup,

13:03.891 --> 13:05.424
just like you said they would.

13:05.492 --> 13:08.527
We even sold some
cellulite cream to a fat boy.

13:08.595 --> 13:09.679
Excellent.

13:09.704 --> 13:12.701
Fun fact... transfer students
are always hard up for friends.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.170
They'll do anything to fit in.

13:14.195 --> 13:16.343
So make sure to sell them
the big-ticket items.

13:16.459 --> 13:17.640
Okay?

13:18.772 --> 13:20.338
Chelsea, you're having children

13:20.407 --> 13:22.943
prey on each other's
insecurities to sell makeup?

13:22.968 --> 13:25.911
Oh, but Jennifer Aniston
can make me hate myself enough

13:25.979 --> 13:27.746
to buy fancy water?

13:27.815 --> 13:29.460
It's called sales, Caroline.

13:30.132 --> 13:31.616
Oh, my God.

13:31.817 --> 13:33.851
Is Cecelia eating a leaf?

13:35.055 --> 13:36.273
Mmm.

13:37.945 --> 13:41.148
Okay, listen, you two babies.
I'm laying down the law.

13:41.203 --> 13:44.632
I'm tired of your inability
to communicate like adults.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.467
This isn't about winning
or who's right or who's wrong.

13:47.492 --> 13:50.702
It's about Ian, your son. Remember him?

13:50.771 --> 13:53.468
Now get it together.

13:54.226 --> 13:58.643
You assholes!

13:59.851 --> 14:02.814
Did you just call us assholes?

14:03.070 --> 14:06.084
That was highly inappropriate.

14:06.153 --> 14:08.053
- Are you okay?
- I-I don't know.

14:08.122 --> 14:10.322
- Are you okay?
- No, I am shaken.

14:10.390 --> 14:13.757
Oh. How dare you
call my husband an asshole?

14:14.023 --> 14:15.293
He yelled at me today.

14:15.362 --> 14:17.662
Well, I'm sorry if my husband
got passionate

14:17.731 --> 14:19.231
about his son's well-being.

14:19.299 --> 14:21.789
Why are you defending him?
You called him a...

14:23.000 --> 14:24.201
Shrimp penis.

14:24.226 --> 14:26.605
Well, if she said that,
and I highly doubt she did...

14:26.673 --> 14:28.740
- I didn't.
- She did so in the sanctity

14:28.809 --> 14:31.343
of a parent-teacher conference.
That's right.

14:31.593 --> 14:34.343
I am so sick of you
being attacked like this.

14:34.539 --> 14:36.414
Come on, let's go. Yeah, we're leaving.

14:36.483 --> 14:38.884
Oh, and for your information,

14:39.109 --> 14:41.585
this man tried to take a fist for me.

14:42.539 --> 14:45.524
- Like a boss.
- Like a boss.

14:45.592 --> 14:48.393
This isn't your mother's mommy group.

14:48.462 --> 14:50.428
Nobody's gonna tell us
what to do, right?

14:50.497 --> 14:52.764
- Right!
- We make our own rules!

14:52.789 --> 14:54.566
- Right?
- Right!

14:54.635 --> 14:57.903
Leggo My Preggo!

14:57.971 --> 15:01.139
Leggo My Preggo!

15:10.703 --> 15:12.403
Hey, what are you doing here?

15:12.472 --> 15:14.805
Oh, I was going to Mommies 4 Mommies.

15:14.874 --> 15:17.375
- I told you I quit that.
- Yeah, I know.

15:17.443 --> 15:19.543
I was just, uh, gonna... gonna go alone.

15:19.612 --> 15:22.213
- Are you kidding me?
- I need support, too, Deb.

15:22.282 --> 15:23.814
You're not the only one
who's pregnant here.

15:23.883 --> 15:25.283
Yes, I am.

15:25.351 --> 15:27.518
You just like to wear
elastic stretch pants.

15:27.587 --> 15:29.186
Please don't take this the wrong way.

15:29.255 --> 15:31.055
- Oh, here we go.
- I just feel like you're not

15:31.124 --> 15:32.623
willing to listen to anyone.

15:32.692 --> 15:35.186
I mean, you dismiss
everybody's advice out of hand.

15:35.211 --> 15:36.477
We've never done this before.

15:36.546 --> 15:37.912
Maybe it will be better for the baby

15:37.981 --> 15:39.981
- if you didn't get the epidural.
- Oh-ho-ho.

15:40.049 --> 15:43.317
This is my pregnancy,
and I don't want any of that.

15:43.386 --> 15:46.421
Yeah, it's your pregnancy,
but it's our baby.

15:46.489 --> 15:48.156
I-I just want to
consider all the options.

15:48.224 --> 15:50.224
Great, go consider them.

15:50.293 --> 15:53.895
And while you're hanging out
with all of the perfect moms,

15:53.963 --> 15:56.364
tell Honour I looked her up on Facebook,

15:56.433 --> 15:58.804
and of course her real name is Ruth.

15:58.829 --> 16:00.640
Of course it is!

16:03.640 --> 16:06.407
Cecelia, I see you tried
Bishop and Boo's

16:06.476 --> 16:08.335
Perfectly Kissable lipstick.

16:08.992 --> 16:10.311
Oh.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.447
- You got a little on your teeth.
- Uh-huh.

16:12.515 --> 16:13.945
It's delicious.

16:16.219 --> 16:17.429
Mmm.

16:18.063 --> 16:19.203
Mmm.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.954
That'll be $29.95.

16:22.531 --> 16:24.392
You made my parents get back together.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.027
- Aren't you happy?
- No.

16:26.095 --> 16:28.396
If they're back together,
they'll fight all the time.

16:29.666 --> 16:32.066
I bet they'd get along
just fine if it wasn't for me.

16:32.135 --> 16:34.769
Oh, honey, that's a very common thing

16:34.838 --> 16:36.604
for children to think
when they're parents

16:36.673 --> 16:39.507
are getting divorced,
but that's not true.

16:39.576 --> 16:41.742
They love you very much.

16:41.811 --> 16:44.171
Then why were they always
arguing about me?

16:44.210 --> 16:47.682
They were arguing about
getting to spend time with you.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.717
- Really?
- Absolutely.

16:49.786 --> 16:51.385
I guess they really do love me.

16:51.454 --> 16:52.753
Of course they do.

16:52.822 --> 16:56.320
They flew all the way
to Chechnya to adopt you.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.826
I'm adopted?

16:58.617 --> 16:59.861
Ooh.

16:59.929 --> 17:03.397
- You told him he was adopted?
- You told her he was adopted?

17:03.466 --> 17:05.217
I'm so sorry.
If I had known it was a secret,

17:05.242 --> 17:06.501
I wouldn't have said anything.

17:06.569 --> 17:08.669
We were waiting to tell him
after his bar mitzvah.

17:08.738 --> 17:11.172
I told you that
that would be way too late.

17:11.241 --> 17:13.174
If we waited that long,
he would have figured out

17:13.242 --> 17:14.642
why he doesn't look Jewish.

17:14.711 --> 17:18.779
Oh, my God, that is so offensive, Lonny.

17:18.848 --> 17:21.482
You know what? This is over.
And I mean it this time.

17:21.550 --> 17:23.384
- Oh, fine by me.
- Great.

17:23.453 --> 17:26.185
Well, let's go tell Ian
we're getting divorced again.

17:26.210 --> 17:27.421
- Terrific.
- Fine.

17:27.490 --> 17:29.457
I am so sick of you
and your anti-Semitic comments.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.559
Oh, you have no room to talk
with the amount

17:31.628 --> 17:33.094
of Mexican jokes you tell.

17:33.460 --> 17:35.742
Margot, how many sales
did you make today?

17:35.767 --> 17:39.570
Zero. No one will buy anything
since the mascara recall.

17:43.439 --> 17:46.040
Margot? Margot, come back here.

17:46.460 --> 17:47.679
What recall?

17:47.716 --> 17:50.937
Hey, Damien,
how was your meeting with Ruth?

17:51.981 --> 17:53.214
Ignore her.

17:53.283 --> 17:56.093
Oh, of course
she's telling you what to do.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.685
Grow some balls.

17:57.754 --> 17:59.487
Hey, wanting the best for our baby

17:59.556 --> 18:01.355
does not mean I don't have balls, Deb.

18:01.424 --> 18:04.058
Yes, we saw your
foul-mouthed video, Deborah.

18:04.127 --> 18:06.260
Don't be surprised
if your baby's first word

18:06.329 --> 18:08.763
is the f-bomb. I pity your child.

18:08.831 --> 18:11.699
Not everyone
wants to crap their baby out

18:11.768 --> 18:14.602
on the top of a mountain
like "The Lion King."

18:14.671 --> 18:16.737
Oh, well, of course
you would think that, Siobhan,

18:16.806 --> 18:19.540
since everyone here knows
your emergency C-section

18:19.609 --> 18:20.908
was planned weeks in advance.

18:20.977 --> 18:23.711
- Eat me!
- Okay, everybody calm down.

18:23.780 --> 18:25.379
Oh, shut up, Deborah!

18:25.448 --> 18:28.049
Why don't you do us all a favor
and get your tubes tied

18:28.117 --> 18:29.717
so you don't bring another drug addict

18:29.786 --> 18:31.319
into this world,
who will probably grow up

18:31.387 --> 18:32.853
and become a serial killer

18:32.922 --> 18:34.855
because you find
breastfeeding inconvenient?

18:34.924 --> 18:36.624
Hey, that's our kid
you're talking about.

18:36.693 --> 18:38.826
It is not your kid! It's Deb's!

18:38.895 --> 18:40.804
Relax. It's his kid, too.

18:40.829 --> 18:43.250
If you admit that,
then he will try to tell you what to do!

18:43.275 --> 18:45.700
Okay, this is straight up bonkers.

18:45.768 --> 18:47.401
I'm dissolving Leggo My Preggo.

18:48.738 --> 18:50.104
I got to bounce. I'm starving.

18:50.173 --> 18:53.039
I'll join you.
I'm sorry, Ruth. I got to quit.

18:53.064 --> 18:55.064
My name is Honour!

18:55.311 --> 18:56.377
Aah!

18:58.948 --> 19:00.381
Hi, ladies.

19:00.450 --> 19:02.859
I've got fading cream,
you've got stretch marks.

19:02.884 --> 19:04.646
Let's do business!

19:04.671 --> 19:06.201
- Caroline.
- Aah!

19:06.226 --> 19:09.056
Your janky mascara
gave me Robert Durst eyes.

19:09.125 --> 19:11.525
I'm sorry! I didn't know
about the recall!

19:11.594 --> 19:13.492
Besides, it's not that bad.

19:14.015 --> 19:15.630
Then why aren't you looking at me?

19:16.933 --> 19:19.953
- Look at me!
- I can't.

19:20.269 --> 19:22.169
I'm afraid of sharks.

19:22.238 --> 19:25.640
I am gonna tell everyone
about your Bishop and Bullshit!

19:25.708 --> 19:27.507
You are never gonna get a Jetta!

19:28.177 --> 19:30.111
No!

19:32.193 --> 19:33.892
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

19:34.625 --> 19:37.196
I'm sorry I got
all up in your pregnancy.

19:37.656 --> 19:39.790
That's okay. You should be involved.

19:39.858 --> 19:41.992
And we'll figure
this stuff out together.

19:42.061 --> 19:45.629
We both want the same thing...
for our baby to flourish

19:45.698 --> 19:48.465
in a nurturing
and enriching environment.

19:48.898 --> 19:50.171
Totally.
