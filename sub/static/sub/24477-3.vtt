00:07.094 --> 00:08.617
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.619
And check out our other Fox shows--

-andThe Last Man on Earth.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.972
Only on Fox.

Ladies, stop stuffing yourselves
with pancakes. Daddy's coming in

00:22.674 --> 00:25.721
at a nine, and we're seconds
away from being at a ten.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.853
I got Ruth an interview
at Lillypads,

00:27.897 --> 00:29.377
the most prestigious preschool

00:29.420 --> 00:31.335
in all
of Jerry Brown's California!

00:31.379 --> 00:34.730
-Ugh! Lillypads? -I found out
there was an opening.

00:34.773 --> 00:38.647
Uh, the mayor of Malibu's son
just disappeared like that.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.257
We're all praying
for his safe return, of course,

00:40.301 --> 00:43.826
-just not until enrollment
closes. -JESS: Oh, my God.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.610
Wait. Didn't you guys already
look at a preschool?

00:45.654 --> 00:47.047
[scoffs]
You mean Triangles?

00:47.090 --> 00:48.265
[chickens clucking]

00:48.309 --> 00:51.312
Okay.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.618
-Ew.
-Chicken.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.185
-Hmm? -I made eye contact
with the chicken.

00:55.229 --> 00:56.447
He knows
that I had eggs for breakfast.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.188
Take her. Take the pretty one.

00:58.232 --> 01:00.277
-I don't think that a chicken
cares that you had eggs. -No!

01:00.321 --> 01:01.713
I mean, I kind of
liked Triangles.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.151
Besides, are we really
Lillypads people?

01:04.194 --> 01:06.196
-Yes. -I hope not.
That kind of competitive,

01:12.333 --> 01:15.118
I got out of teaching
in the first place.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.163
What did happen
at Banyon Canyon?

01:16.206 --> 01:17.512
Yeah, what did happen
at Banyon Canyon?

01:17.555 --> 01:19.079
You know I can't
discuss that until

01:19.122 --> 01:20.645
one of four
civil lawsuits is settled.

01:20.689 --> 01:23.300
-I know, but what...
-No further questions. You guys,

01:23.344 --> 01:25.694
this is crazy. Look at this
beautiful, impressionable child.

01:25.737 --> 01:28.131
Lillypads is the key
to Ruth's future.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.873
If she gets into Lillypads,
she gets into Willows.

01:30.916 --> 01:32.396
If she gets into Willows,
she gets into Harvard.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.702
And if she gets into Harvard,

01:33.745 --> 01:35.225
it's a bullet train
to the Oval Office.

01:35.269 --> 01:37.880
-Hmm. -Don't you want Ruth
to be the president?

01:37.923 --> 01:40.143
Of course I do,
but you can do it without going

01:40.187 --> 01:42.189
to some pressure cooker
that turns her into a robot.

Robots are helpful and

-often delightful. -CECE: Please
don't start this again.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.197
You two have been arguing
about how Ruth should be raised

01:50.240 --> 01:51.372
since the day she was born.

01:51.415 --> 01:53.025
SCHMIDT:
I'm sorry, I have to.

01:53.069 --> 01:54.462
Okay, if it was up to her,
Ruth would have been born

01:54.505 --> 01:56.028
in a rusty tub in the Ladies Y.

Just give her a minute.

-Yeah.

There she is. -There she is.

Oh. We're not,
we're not gonna make it.

02:41.422 --> 02:42.771
I'll figure it out.

Wait, wait, what does that mean?

We just came back

from Lillypads
and we need your help.

SCHMIDT: We were picking up
our paperwork

former best friend of mine,
Benjamin.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.965
Have you gotten your kid
ready for this interview yet?

03:03.008 --> 03:04.532
We got ourselves
a 365 tutor, baby.

W-What are they
getting tested on?

Draw a face. Cut a circle.
Know colors. Make eye contact.

Oh, yeah.
That's my seed, all right.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.468
I had to lay down.
At which point, Benjamin's child

-Ew. Preschool tutors? [scoffs]
-SCHMIDT: Okay, Jess,

03:34.866 --> 03:36.433
Ruth is never going to make it
through this interview

03:36.477 --> 03:39.480
without a professional tutor.
And if we look past the whole

03:39.523 --> 03:42.134
Banyon Canyon debacle,
that's you.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.441
Eh, I got out of that game
years ago.

03:44.485 --> 03:45.573
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

03:45.616 --> 03:47.575
but Lillypads
was really magical.

03:47.618 --> 03:51.100
The kids wear uniforms and,
you know, not to sound weird,

03:51.143 --> 03:53.581
-but they look hot.
-That sounds weird.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.452
-They did.
-I hear you, I hear you.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.280
They looked super hot.
Anyway, I have to run to work,

03:57.324 --> 03:59.064
so is there any chance
that you could, you know,

03:59.108 --> 04:01.458
teach her how to draw a face,
cut a circle,

04:01.502 --> 04:03.243
carry out a conversation...

04:03.286 --> 04:04.374
Okay, fine. I'll do it,
for Ruth.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.594
-Great. -Yes.
-Under one condition.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.900
-CECE: Sure.
-You do it on my terms.

04:08.944 --> 04:12.034
-What? -I'm gonna have to go
on a craft run, aren't I?

04:12.077 --> 04:13.818
I'm gonna need pipe cleaners,
glitter, glue,

04:13.862 --> 04:15.385
finger paints and six different
types of macaroni.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.126
And that's just
'cause I'm hungry.

04:17.169 --> 04:19.607
Honest to God, you don't
already have all of that

04:19.650 --> 04:22.479
in this room already?

04:28.877 --> 04:31.227
Martini time.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.882
I like martinis.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.496
You know, I would be
back to writing

04:39.540 --> 04:42.325
because I'm kind of
in a nice flow, but, say,

04:42.369 --> 04:44.632
do you mind telling me
that really interesting story

04:44.675 --> 04:47.417
you just told me about when
you bought those shorts?

04:47.461 --> 04:49.158
I bought 'em.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.639
[laughs]
A-And from the start of it,

04:51.682 --> 04:53.293
when you realized
you needed new shorts?

04:53.336 --> 04:54.946
What was going on there?

04:54.990 --> 04:56.557
You just looked around your
house and there weren't shorts?

04:56.600 --> 04:58.080
Not the fingers, man,
I'm a writer.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.473
What are you doing here,
coming up on me like a maniac?

04:59.516 --> 05:00.822
Um, it's me, Winston.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.302
Sorry, man, I'm just
really edgy right now.

05:02.345 --> 05:03.651
-All right, man.
-Working on this thing

05:03.694 --> 05:05.696
-about Chicago, actually.
-Ooh.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.655
So you know it's gonna be raw.
You know it's gonna be personal.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.483
-Oh, yeah.
-Also, it doesn't exist.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.659
And if I don't have 20 pages
by 3:00 today,

05:11.702 --> 05:13.704
-I'm gonna get punched
in the face. -Who, your editor?

05:13.748 --> 05:15.532
No. Some guy I hired
off Craigslist.

05:15.576 --> 05:18.143
Wait, so you hired a man
to punch you in the face

05:18.187 --> 05:19.667
if you don't write 20 pages?

05:19.710 --> 05:21.669
Yeah. I have no idea
what he looks like, either.

05:21.712 --> 05:22.887
You know, I would have punched
you in the face for free.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.193
-Well, I got somebody.
-Okay.

05:24.236 --> 05:25.542
Well, anyway,
I have a real problem,

05:25.586 --> 05:27.109
one that I didn't bring
on myself.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.676
I'm just really slammed.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.939
So, I'm a detective now and I
have to testify in these trials.

05:30.982 --> 05:34.595
But you know I get rattled
on the stand.

05:34.638 --> 05:37.206
Can you repeat the question?

05:37.249 --> 05:40.078
I asked you if you'd like me
to repeat the question.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.475
Can you repeat the question?

05:50.611 --> 05:52.439
Can you have her
repeat the question?

05:52.482 --> 05:55.529
-Let's dig in.
-Thank you.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.139
When I was at law school,
I-I learned

05:57.182 --> 05:59.010
that if somebody falls apart
on the stand,

05:59.054 --> 06:00.708
it's mostly because
they're hiding something.

06:00.751 --> 06:02.492
So, I guess my question
to you, Detective, is:

06:02.536 --> 06:05.713
-what are you hiding?
-Nothing.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.932
-Nothing? [laughs]
-I have nothing to hide.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.195
Well, maybe not on this case,
but perhaps you're hiding

06:10.239 --> 06:13.547
something from... your past?

06:13.590 --> 06:15.331
Objection.
Form of a question.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.942
Withdrawn.
Isn't it true, Detective,

06:17.986 --> 06:19.640
that this could be the result
of a guilty conscience?

06:19.683 --> 06:21.163
I have nothing
to be guilty about.

06:21.206 --> 06:24.427
Ladies and gentlemen,
are we buying this?

06:24.471 --> 06:26.777
'Cause I'm not.

06:26.821 --> 06:30.259
My question is about the night
of January 12.

06:30.302 --> 06:32.000
-Wait, what? No, no, no. No, no.
-2001.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.350
Nick, that is a cold case and
I won't discuss it any further.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.656
Well, looks like
we're discussing it now.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.571
I was not masturbating!

06:39.050 --> 06:40.530

06:40.574 --> 06:42.271
You just screamed
"masturbating."

-What are you doing, man?
-Sorry.

06:44.229 --> 06:48.016

What are they doing?

06:55.719 --> 06:56.546
What are they doing? What
are they doing?

06:56.590 --> 06:58.200
What are, what are they doing?!

07:00.811 --> 07:02.247
well, good, wonderful.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.553
So, you're teaching Ruth
how to do the one thing

07:03.597 --> 07:05.425
she's known how to do
since birth.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.991
Do you want to get one
of your other teacher friends

07:07.035 --> 07:08.297
to prep your child for free?

07:08.340 --> 07:09.472
[whispering]:
I didn't think so.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.213
So shut your souphole.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.433
Oh, look, it's Happy Sock.

-Hi, Happy Sock.
-Hi.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.612
JESS:
See, Schmidt?

07:18.655 --> 07:20.265
We're not cutting circles;
we're being circles.

07:20.309 --> 07:21.528
Right. Of course.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.007
Ruth can't hold a scissor,
but now she can

twirl around like a goon
at a Phish show.

07:25.793 --> 07:28.535
Okay, well, now
you're just napping.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.625
We're not napping, we're going
on a brain exploration.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.104
I take that back, actually.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.238
Okay, well, that's enough, Jess.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.240
You're sending Ruth straight
to Triangles. You hear that?

07:38.283 --> 07:40.503
[mimics a chicken]
That's the schoolyard chickens.

07:40.547 --> 07:43.463
And they're...
and they're pecking at Ruth.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.464
And this time,
they want her eyes.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.857
I need my eyes for TV.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.685
Oh, honey, don't you worry
about a thing, okay?

07:48.729 --> 07:50.034
Daddy's gonna take over now.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.036
But the clock is a-ticking,

07:52.080 --> 07:53.037
so let's start with a drill.

07:53.081 --> 07:55.257
No. No drills.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.345
DRILL is an acronym.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.042
D: Do it. R: Redo it.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.479
I:
Imitate what you just did.

07:59.522 --> 08:00.828
L:
Learn to keep doing it.

08:00.871 --> 08:02.612
L: Live the rest of your life
doing it.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.048
DRILL, DRILL, DRILL.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.702
Technically, that's an acrostic.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.487
[high-pitched]:
Sweet burn, Jess.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.314
Yeah. You got me. DRILL.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.188
SCHMIDT:
And again.

08:13.231 --> 08:15.495
RUTH: Red, yellow, orange,

08:15.538 --> 08:17.279
-green.
-And that

08:17.322 --> 08:20.630
is how you earn a dollar
in America.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.632
[quietly]: She's not your child,
she's not your child...

08:22.676 --> 08:25.592
Okay, Ruth, we're gonna do the
colors one more time, and then,

08:25.635 --> 08:27.419
we're gonna move on to a section
that I like to call

08:27.463 --> 08:28.899
"Get the numbers right,
and Daddy will give you

08:28.943 --> 08:30.074
a stuffed animal."

08:30.118 --> 08:31.641
SCHMIDT:
Here we go.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.077
RUTH:
Red, yellow, orange,

08:33.121 --> 08:35.602
Denise.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.081
-Yes.
-SCHMIDT: I'm sorry. Uh...

08:37.125 --> 08:38.648
Did you just call green
"Denise"?

08:38.692 --> 08:41.651
Yes. The color's name is Denise.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.610
Well, I hope you're happy.
The interview is in an hour,

08:43.653 --> 08:45.481
and now green is Denise.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.744
Green is whatever
she wants it to be.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.311
[whispers]: Green is whatever
I want it to be.

08:49.354 --> 08:50.573
-Huh.
-JESS: Green could be Denise

08:50.617 --> 08:52.749
or Juanita or Jerry.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.751
I just realized...
[laughs]

08:54.795 --> 08:57.319
-...green is Jerry, for me.
-Green is not Jerry for me.

08:57.362 --> 09:00.322
Are you and Aunt Jess
in a fight?

09:00.365 --> 09:02.672
Oh, no, no, no.
Uh, we're just telling stories.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.892
Uh, once upon a time, there was
a fuzzy bunny who decided

09:04.935 --> 09:07.198
who decided that colors
didn't need names,

09:07.242 --> 09:08.678
and anything could be
called anything,

09:08.722 --> 09:10.550
and the world descended
into chaos.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.595
But the bunny was happy,
because the bunny wasn't forced

09:12.639 --> 09:15.511
-into somebody else's definition
of color. -Well, the fuzzy bunny

09:15.555 --> 09:17.165
wasn't really an authority,
now, was she?

09:17.208 --> 09:19.776
Because she used to work at a
school where instead of grades,

09:19.820 --> 09:21.125
they gave out rainbows.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.780
Bringing up the bunny's past
is uncalled for

09:23.824 --> 09:26.478
in this cabbage patch.
But the point is:

09:26.522 --> 09:30.178
I know about private schools,
and the whole system is corrupt.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.093
Said the very fuzzy bunny.

09:32.136 --> 09:35.357
Until the Jewish carrot farmer
brought down his mighty shovel.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.967
-The whole system is corrupt.
-[door closes]

09:37.011 --> 09:38.708
-What's going on?
-SCHMIDT: Your friend

09:38.752 --> 09:41.145
-is costing us Washington.
-Why didn't you marry Shivrang?

09:41.189 --> 09:43.583
Ruth, is that coffee?

09:43.626 --> 09:45.846
-Yep.
-Okay, there is a child here.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.195
I'm gonna take her
to the bedroom right now

09:47.238 --> 09:48.370
so she can watch
local news bloopers.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.459
I don't know why she likes them
so much.

09:50.502 --> 09:51.982
They're blowing their big shot.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.594
Okay. All right honey, let's go.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.944
Bye, honey.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.685
Mm-hmm. Talk to you later.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.164
Bye, Ruth. Great job.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.384
SCHMIDT:
Green is green.

10:02.427 --> 10:04.865
-You did this. You did this.
-You did this. You did this.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.564
-You did this.
-You did this.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.521
WINSTON:
Are we still on this?

10:09.565 --> 10:10.522
When are you gonna let this go?

10:10.566 --> 10:11.959
When you come clean, Detective.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.613
There is nothing
to come clean about.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.615
Wait, aren't you 11 pages away

10:15.658 --> 10:16.616
from getting punched
in the face?

10:16.659 --> 10:18.052
Oh, just answer the question.

10:18.095 --> 10:21.403
Does or does not the evidence
speak for itself?

10:21.446 --> 10:23.405
Do I need to refresh
your memory, sir?

10:23.448 --> 10:26.887
I didn't phone ahead
to warn you of my arrival.

10:26.930 --> 10:29.193
I just thought it would be fun
to surprise you at college.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.412
WINSTON:
It was fun.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.718
Well, it should have been fun.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.633
NICK: A man in front of a computer...

10:33.676 --> 10:35.417
[echoes]:
No...

10:35.460 --> 10:36.636
WINSTON:
I was checking my EarthLink.

10:36.679 --> 10:37.724
NICK:
With no pants on.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.900
WINSTON:
You know my bottoms run hot!

10:39.943 --> 10:41.423
NICK:
Tissues suspiciously close.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.425
WINSTON:
They were Doug's.

10:43.468 --> 10:44.818
Lotion. One sock.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.254
Ashy elbows. Cold left foot.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.472
Look, why am I explaining this
to you?

10:47.516 --> 10:49.083
You're the one
who's supposed to be

10:49.126 --> 10:50.258
writing right now.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.781
You know what I figured out?

10:51.825 --> 10:53.435
You are a procrastinator.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.828
Said the pro-masturbator.

10:54.871 --> 10:55.829
You always procrastinate
when something

10:55.872 --> 10:57.047
is important to you.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.483
And you know how I know?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.791
January 12, 2001.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.793
-Damn you. -You drove
eight hours across the country

11:03.837 --> 11:05.447
to come see me at college,

11:05.490 --> 11:08.232
to ask me if I have seen
A Bug's Life.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.625
-Oh...
-A Bug's Life.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.061
The weekend
before your midterms.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.497
You son of a bitch!

11:12.541 --> 11:14.108
♪ Big test, oh, yeah.♪

11:16.327 --> 11:17.459
Focus.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.765
[chuckles]

11:18.808 --> 11:21.289
Oh, I got to pick that up.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.725
Whoa!

11:25.902 --> 11:28.035
It's been a while though,
hasn't it?

11:28.078 --> 11:30.515
You should have appreciated the
fact that your friend hitchhiked

11:30.559 --> 11:32.822
across the country to visit you.

11:32.866 --> 11:35.129
-[both laugh]
-You're a procrastinator.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.479
You want to know why you
procrastinate? I'll tell you.

11:37.522 --> 11:38.523
But you didn't give me
a chance to answer.

11:38.567 --> 11:39.524
How am I supposed to answer

11:39.568 --> 11:40.874
if not given the chance?

11:40.917 --> 11:43.485
-Fine. Answer.
-It's a vague question.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.008
It's not a vague question.
Why do you procrastinate?

11:45.052 --> 11:47.097
-I don't know.
-Nick, you procrastinate

11:47.141 --> 11:49.926
when something is important
to you, because deep down,

11:49.970 --> 11:52.059
you're don't think you're
good enough to get it done.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.714
[laughing]:
That's the dumbest thing I've...

11:54.757 --> 11:56.106
It's also...
that's possibly true,

11:56.150 --> 11:58.282
because that really feels
like what I do when I...

11:58.326 --> 11:59.936
Keep going,
you're in a good zone.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.503
So, of course, when you actually
get the opportunity

12:01.546 --> 12:03.723
to write something
about your own life,

12:03.766 --> 12:04.898
the first thing you do is choke.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.074
You know how I know?

12:07.117 --> 12:09.685
Well, because for some reason,
I'm your oldest friend.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.340
So I hope you get punched
in the face today.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.037
I really do.

12:14.081 --> 12:16.083
And then maybe,
you'll finally see

12:16.126 --> 12:20.130
that you are good enough to
be everything you want to be.

12:22.567 --> 12:23.830
You masturbated one time.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.310
I swear to God, Nick.

12:26.354 --> 12:29.009
If I wasn't kicked off
of Craigslist...

12:33.883 --> 12:36.364
Schmidt, you look
like you're gonna be sick.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.975
Remember, they've only been
on the planet for three years.

12:39.019 --> 12:42.587
Oh, God. Is that kid reading
Jonathan Franzen?

12:42.631 --> 12:45.242
Wow, this place is like
the frickin' Louvre.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.549
There's a kid handing out mints
in the bathroom.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.769
Well, then, why'd you come?
To see your liberal snowflake

12:49.812 --> 12:52.380
-hippie trash handiwork?
-No. I came for Ruth.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.556
And in silent protest
against institutions

12:54.599 --> 12:57.080
such as this hellhole.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.908
But it's quicker
to say "for Ruth."

12:58.952 --> 13:00.997
-You are a queer little woman.
-Guys, tighten up. All right?

13:01.041 --> 13:02.912
They started assessing us
the minute we parked the car.

13:02.956 --> 13:05.393
-Xiawuhao.
-What?

13:05.436 --> 13:06.873
That's "good afternoon"
in Mandarin.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.178
Just a little amuse-bouche
for the judges.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.877
I also brought
an actual amuse-bouche.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.922
It's a crostini
with burrata and tomato.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.837
Doesn't that sound yummy,
Schmidt?

13:14.881 --> 13:16.970
Back off, Benjamin.
Your burrata doesn't scare me.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.146
-[laughs] I think it does.
-It kind of scares me.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.583
Ruth, just ignore them. You're
gonna do great in there, okay?

13:21.626 --> 13:22.584
Feeling good?

13:22.627 --> 13:23.846
Meow.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.762
Ha! She just said "meow."

13:26.806 --> 13:29.025
[both laugh]

13:29.069 --> 13:31.419
MISS CARLY:
Okay. Kids,

13:31.462 --> 13:32.942
you can go inside. And parents,

13:32.986 --> 13:35.118
you'll be watching
from a two-way mirror,

13:35.162 --> 13:36.859
which was a generous gift
from a family

13:36.903 --> 13:39.383
that's too powerful to name.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.211
[whispers]:
It's Tate Donovan.

13:41.255 --> 13:43.997
-Oof.
-All right. Let's go.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.389
-Let's hit it.
-Okay, you ready, honey?

13:45.433 --> 13:46.826
Remember what we talked about.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.915
ROYGBIV. Red, orange, yellow...

13:48.958 --> 13:51.178
Schmidt, she's got it. Okay?
You're gonna do great in there.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.049
You're gonna bring the heat,
aren't you, Ruth?

13:53.093 --> 13:54.659
Ruth gonna do
what Ruth gonna do.

13:54.703 --> 13:57.053
-Oh, dear God.
-Okay.

13:59.621 --> 14:03.190
-Please state your name, sir.
-[whispers]: So...

14:03.233 --> 14:05.453
I'm Winston Bottoms.

14:05.496 --> 14:08.064
Uh, Winston
I Was Wearing Bottoms.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.674
Damn it. S-I'm sorry to curse.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.938
I didn't mean-- uh,
that's... I know my name.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.635
Let's just get that--
let the record show that.

14:13.678 --> 14:14.854
When you do your thing.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.638
And um...

14:16.681 --> 14:20.294
I'm Detective Bottoms.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.078
Are you okay, sir?

14:22.122 --> 14:24.080
Ha. I'm-I'm... yes, sir,
I'm sorry, um...

14:24.124 --> 14:26.561
My lower half
has got the sweats.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.651
I'd like to put in a request
for a wet wipe.

14:29.694 --> 14:30.913
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

14:30.957 --> 14:33.220
if anyone has a wet wipe,
I will gladly

14:33.263 --> 14:37.093
receive said wet wipe
and clean off my lower half.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.661
Your Honor,
may I request a recess?

14:39.704 --> 14:41.968
Come on, Miller,
churn out the magic.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.187
Come on. Let's get started.
Let's go.

14:44.231 --> 14:48.017
"Nick Miller grew up in Chicago.

14:48.061 --> 14:52.456
"He came from a family.
He hated Winston.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.111
"Winston was really annoying.

14:55.155 --> 14:57.679
In a lot of ways, Winston is
still annoying, but..."

14:57.722 --> 15:00.247
It's supposed to be about me!

15:00.290 --> 15:02.945
Stupid Winston,
it's sup... [sighs]

15:02.989 --> 15:05.948
I'm screwed, I only have six
pages. What time is it?

15:05.992 --> 15:08.168
Mmm... 3:01.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.387
3:01. I'm screwed.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.475
[groans]

15:11.519 --> 15:13.695
[laughing]

15:13.738 --> 15:15.044
It was you.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.264
Craigslist, bitch!
[laughs]

15:17.307 --> 15:19.962
It was always you.

15:22.356 --> 15:25.968
Wow, Stuart really nailed
the face-drawing portion.

15:26.012 --> 15:29.058
He included eyelashes
and expressive eyebrows.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.495
Must you narrate?
The whole point

15:31.539 --> 15:34.934
of the audio-enhanced plexiglass
is that I can hear on my own.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.110
Oh, boy,
it's circle-cutting time.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.547
Miss Carly is handing
the scissors to Ruth.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.462
Ruth is taking the scissors.

15:41.505 --> 15:42.942
Ruth is starting to use
the scissors.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.726
SCHMIDT: Don't tell me
what she's doing.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.510
Actually, you know what?
tell me. Never tell me.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.512
Forget it, this is a disaster,
we should go.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.427
Ruth S.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.126
Your circle is perfect.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.779
