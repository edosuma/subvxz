WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.603
HEY, BOBBY,

00:02.603 --> 00:04.135
YOU KNOW HOW I TELL YOU NOT
TO FEED THE SEAGULLS OUT BACK?

00:04.135 --> 00:05.706
THAT'S WHY.
(seagulls calling)

00:05.706 --> 00:07.508
(laughs) SORRY.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.440
YEAH, THE SEAGULL POPULATION
IN THIS TOWN HAS EXPLODED.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.042
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

00:11.042 --> 00:12.283
AS MAYOR--
OH!

00:12.283 --> 00:14.345
MNH-MNH!
UGH!

00:15.586 --> 00:17.288
(grunts)

00:17.288 --> 00:19.120
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
EVER SINCE YOU BECAME MAYOR,

00:19.120 --> 00:22.523
YOU SEEM TO REALLY ENJOY SAYING
"AS MAYOR."

00:22.523 --> 00:24.625
SO I DECIDED WHENEVER YOU DO IT,

00:24.625 --> 00:28.459
WHOEVER TOUCHES THEIR NOSE LAST
HAS TO DO THE CRAB WALK.

00:28.459 --> 00:30.331
I DON'T SAY "AS MAYOR"
THAT MUCH.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.732
OP!
AH!

00:31.732 --> 00:33.164
GET CRABBIN', BITCH.

00:33.164 --> 00:35.166
(groans) WAIT.

00:35.166 --> 00:38.469
OOH. OOH, THIS IS MURDER
ON MY HAMMIES.

00:38.469 --> 00:42.213
HEY, GUYS. I JUST SAW AN AMAZING
DOCUMENTARY ON TORT REFORM.

00:42.213 --> 00:43.814
I DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT PASTRIES, TOM.

00:43.814 --> 00:45.746
UH, NO, NO, NO.
UH, TORTS ARE A-A LEGAL--

00:45.746 --> 00:47.318
I DON'T CARE WHAT
TORTS REALLY ARE.

00:47.318 --> 00:48.579
OH. OKAY. UH, YOU WANT
SOME POPCORN?

00:48.579 --> 00:50.451
TOM, RUN!

00:50.451 --> 00:52.353
RUN? W-WHY WOULD I, UH--
(seagulls squawking)

00:52.353 --> 00:54.585
AAH! NO! NO!
AAH! DON'T! DON'T!

00:54.585 --> 00:57.057
OH!
OH!

00:57.057 --> 00:58.789
DON'T! MAKE 'EM STOP! OUCH!
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!

00:58.789 --> 01:00.431
HEY, GUYS,
IF YOU COVER YOUR EYES,

01:00.431 --> 01:02.363
IT SOUNDS LIKE
WE'RE AT THE BEACH.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.495
AHH.
AHH.

01:04.495 --> 01:06.367
BEAUTIFUL.
(squawking continues)

01:06.367 --> 01:11.402
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:11.402 --> 01:13.244
(chuckles)
WHOA. WAIT.

01:13.244 --> 01:16.407
WHAT THE HELL? THERE'S NOWHERE
TO SIT. THIS SUCKS.

01:16.407 --> 01:19.480
I KNOW! MY BAR IS FULL OF PEOPLE
BUYING FOOD AND DRINKS.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.182
I'M FURIOUS!

01:21.182 --> 01:24.215
WHAT'S WITH THAT GIRL OUTSIDE
WITH THE HUGE BOOBS

01:24.215 --> 01:27.758
JUMPING ROPE,
FLOPPIN' HER BOOBIES AROUND?

01:27.758 --> 01:30.491
FLIPPITY-FLOPPITY.
FLIPPITY-FLOPPITY.
WHOA. OH.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.594
WOW. HOW DID YOU GET SO GOOD
AT LYING?

01:33.594 --> 01:36.697
THERE'S NO SHORTCUT. JUST
PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.669
ALL THESE GUYS PLAY
IN AN ADULT DODGEBALL LEAGUE.

01:38.669 --> 01:40.331
HOW COOL IS THAT?

01:40.331 --> 01:41.772
NOT.
UH, ZERO.

01:41.772 --> 01:44.335
DONALD TRUMP.
THAT MEANS "NOT COOL AT ALL."

01:44.335 --> 01:46.177
I WISH WE DID
MORE FUN STUFF.

01:46.177 --> 01:48.509
BUT WE DO SO MUCH FUN STUFF.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.880
REMEMBER LAST WEEKEND,

01:49.880 --> 01:51.712
WHEN WE GOT IN THE POOL
AND WE DRANK WINE?

01:51.712 --> 01:53.314
HOW COOL WAS THAT?

01:53.314 --> 01:55.546
TED DANSON.
HMM.

01:55.546 --> 01:57.518
WHAT? TED DANSON'S NOT COOL?

01:57.518 --> 01:59.350
HE'S A JUDGE
ON THAT NEW DANCE SHOW CALLED

01:59.350 --> 02:01.392
"CAN'T STOP DANSON."

02:01.392 --> 02:03.624
NO, HE'S NOT, 'CAUSE THAT SHOW
DOESN'T EXIST.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.556
I'LL JUST JOIN
A DODGEBALL LEAGUE

02:05.556 --> 02:08.599
FOR LONELY MEN WHOSE WIVES WON'T
DO STUFF TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.

02:08.599 --> 02:10.861
FINE. SIGN US ALL UP.

02:10.861 --> 02:12.763
(laughs)

02:17.908 --> 02:20.911
(laughs)
HEY, BUDDY. WHAT'S UP?

02:20.911 --> 02:24.545
WHAT'S UP? WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
MEET AT THE BOAT FOR PENNY CAN.

02:24.545 --> 02:27.778
I'M SORRY. I WAS SURFING
WITH MY BUDDY RIGGS.

02:27.778 --> 02:29.650
RIGGS?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.252
MAN, LOOK AT
ALL THESE GULLS.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.753
I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MANY

02:32.753 --> 02:35.626
SINCE THE COAST GUARD HAD TO
EXPLODE THAT BEACHED WHALE.

02:35.626 --> 02:37.228
THAT WAS THE SADDEST...

02:37.228 --> 02:40.291
(laughs) MOST AWESOME THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

02:40.291 --> 02:41.792
DO YOU LIKE RIGGS
MORE THAN ME?

02:41.792 --> 02:44.665
HOW CAN I SAY THIS?

02:44.665 --> 02:47.938
EVEN IF RIGGS TURNED OUT
TO BE BATMAN,

02:47.938 --> 02:49.670
I'D LIKE YOU BETTER.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.572
THANKS.
(chuckles)

02:51.572 --> 02:53.444
YOU KNOW, AS MAYOR,
I'M PRETTY CLOSE

02:53.444 --> 02:55.376
TO BEING
THIS TOWN'S BATMAN.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.348
(sighs) DAMN IT.

02:57.348 --> 02:59.410
GET DOWN, SON.

02:59.410 --> 03:00.681
YEAH!

03:00.681 --> 03:02.353
(laughs) YEAH!

03:02.353 --> 03:04.184
(thud)
YOU'RE OUT.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.757
STOP PRACTICING DODGEBALL
ON ME.
(thud)

03:06.757 --> 03:08.219
YOU SUCK.

03:08.219 --> 03:09.920
TIME FOR FAMILY DINNER.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.893
UH, IF IT'S FAMILY,
THEN WHY IS SHE HERE?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.325
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
EAT WITH ANDY?

03:14.325 --> 03:16.367
I DID THAT YESTERDAY.

03:16.367 --> 03:17.598
NICE CLEAVAGE.

03:17.598 --> 03:18.969
I DID IT FOR JULES.

03:18.969 --> 03:20.431
(singsongy) LOVE IT.
(slaps)

03:20.431 --> 03:21.802
(normal voice)
HEY, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.834
FAMILY PRAYER
BEFORE FAMILY FOOD. HANDS.

03:23.834 --> 03:25.576
OKAY, DEAR LORD,

03:25.576 --> 03:29.610
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
OUR FRIENDS AND OUR FAMILY.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.212
THANK YOU FOR
THIS WONDERFUL FOOD AND...

03:32.212 --> 03:33.614
(sighs loudly)

03:33.614 --> 03:35.886
WHAT WAS THAT?
HMM? NOTHING.

03:35.886 --> 03:38.349
HE WAS ALL LIKE...
(sighs loudly)

03:38.349 --> 03:40.491
(sighs loudly)
WHY?

03:40.491 --> 03:43.494
YOU THROW FOOD AT ME,
YOU PAY THE PRICE.

03:43.494 --> 03:44.895
(utensil clatters)
BRING IT.

03:44.895 --> 03:47.358
I'M GONNA LET THAT ONE GO.

03:47.358 --> 03:49.229
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THE FAMILY PRAYER?

03:49.229 --> 03:52.933
NO. I MEAN, I DON'T LOVE HOLDING
HANDS WITH MR. SWEATY PALMS

03:52.933 --> 03:54.865
OR LADY LIZARD SKIN--

03:54.865 --> 03:56.567
OW! (inhales sharply)

03:56.567 --> 03:57.908
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS
I JUST FIND IT A LITTLE...

03:57.908 --> 03:59.770
WHAT WORD WON'T OFFEND YOU?
SILLY?

04:01.872 --> 04:03.744
ALL RIGHT.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.316
(clattering)

04:05.316 --> 04:07.748
DINNER'S OVER.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.481
NOT FOR YOU TWO.

04:10.481 --> 04:13.654
YOU CAN EAT IN THE OTHER ROOM.

04:16.527 --> 04:19.460
HE BAILED ON ME FOR RIGGS, TOO.
HE TRIED TO TELL ME

04:19.460 --> 04:21.792
THEY SPENT TWO HOURS HAVING
A BURPING CONTEST.

04:21.792 --> 04:23.534
BEST OF 3,
10-MINUTE QUARTERS,

04:23.534 --> 04:26.467
PIG LATIN TIEBREAKER...
IT COULD HAPPEN.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.798
HEY, FELLAS. SORRY I'M LATE.

04:27.798 --> 04:30.371
I WAS PLAYING CARDS
WITH MY BUDDY, UH--

04:30.371 --> 04:31.572
RIGGS.
RIGGS.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.804
YEAH?

04:33.804 --> 04:37.548
GUYS, MEET RIGGS.

04:37.548 --> 04:39.410
BUT YOU'RE--YOU'RE--
YOU'RE A GIRL.

04:39.410 --> 04:40.811
(gasps)

04:40.811 --> 04:43.354
EITHER MY PECKER FELL OFF,
OR YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:43.354 --> 04:45.856
(Riggs and Bobby laugh)

04:45.856 --> 04:47.388
(Bobby) EE!

04:47.388 --> 04:49.520
HOW COME WHEN YOU WERE
HANGING OUT WITH JULES,

04:49.520 --> 04:51.962
YOU ALWAYS LOOK SO SEXY
AND PUT TOGETHER.

04:51.962 --> 04:53.794
BUT WHEN YOU'RE
HANGING AROUND HERE,

04:53.794 --> 04:55.896
YOU LOOK SO...

04:55.896 --> 04:58.629
CAREFUL.
PRETTY IN A DIFFERENT WAY?

04:58.629 --> 05:01.332
I WANNA BE COMFY
WHEN I'M AT HOME.

05:01.332 --> 05:03.033
(wrapper crackles)
THAT'S MY CRACKER POCKET.

05:03.033 --> 05:05.075
THOSE SWEATPANTS
ARE HIDEOUS.

05:05.075 --> 05:06.837
CAN'T YOU BE
COMFY AND SEXY?

05:06.837 --> 05:09.480
I'M JUST GONNA GO DOWN
TO THE MAKE-BELIEVE STORE,

05:09.480 --> 05:11.782
'CAUSE THE COMFY/SEXY CLOTHES
ARE RIGHT NEXT TO

05:11.782 --> 05:14.685
THE CONDOMS THAT ARE
ACTUALLY FOR HER PLEASURE.

05:14.685 --> 05:17.618
I'M ON MY WAY.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.320
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'D MOCK MY PRAYER.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.693
MY COOKING? SURE.
THE WAY I USE MY FINGER

05:22.693 --> 05:24.825
TO GET FOOD OUT OF THE BACK
OF MY TEETH,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.927
AND THEN USE THAT SAME FINGER
TO STIR THE GRAVY?

05:26.927 --> 05:28.859
MOCK AWAY.

05:28.859 --> 05:30.731
I'M REALLY SORRY.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.604
DO YOU EVEN LISTEN TO WHAT
I'M SAYING WHEN I DO THE PRAYER?

05:33.604 --> 05:35.466
I HEAR YOU START,
AND--AND THEN I SNAP BACK

05:35.466 --> 05:37.368
WHEN YOU SAY, "AMEN."

05:37.368 --> 05:38.739
WHAT ABOUT THE MIDDLE?

05:38.739 --> 05:40.511
WELL, THAT'S MY TIME.

05:40.511 --> 05:43.644
I CAN STILL BE MAD
WHILE YOU RUB MY FEET.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.617
I THOUGHT WE HAD
THE SAME IDEAS ON FAITH.

05:46.617 --> 05:48.348
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IN?

05:48.348 --> 05:49.850
I WOULD SAY...

05:49.850 --> 05:51.552
I DON'T BELIEVE IN ANYTHING.

05:51.552 --> 05:52.853
(seagull squawks)
(gasps)

05:54.885 --> 05:58.358
GOD, IF HE'S WRONG,
GIVE ME A SIGN.
TOO LATE.

05:58.358 --> 06:02.433
YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT BEFORE
THE GIANT BIRD FLIES IN.

06:02.433 --> 06:05.095
ALL RIGHT,
WELCOME TO DODGEBALL PRACTICE.

06:05.095 --> 06:06.537
ANY QUESTIONS?

06:06.537 --> 06:07.998
ELLIE, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

06:07.998 --> 06:10.941
DID YOU AND JULES SOLVE
YOUR RELIGIOUS CRISIS?

06:10.941 --> 06:12.603
WE GOT SIDETRACKED

06:12.603 --> 06:14.144
TRYING TO SHOO A GIANT BIRD
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

06:14.144 --> 06:16.977
HE LIVES WITH US NOW.
I NAMED HIM MR. BEAKINGTON.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.849
WE ALSO DECIDED THAT
SHE CAN'T BE MAD AT ME

06:18.849 --> 06:21.081
FOR WHAT I BELIEVE IN.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

06:21.081 --> 06:24.014
HOW COME SOMETIMES I CAN
SEE THE MOON WHEN IT'S DAYTIME?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.588
THE RULES ARE EASY.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.460
IF YOU HIT SOMEONE,
THEY'RE OUT.

06:29.460 --> 06:31.762
BUT YOU CAN'T HIT THEM
ABOVE THE SHOULDERS.

06:31.762 --> 06:33.564
SO IF SOMEONE THROWS A BALL
AND IT HITS YOU IN THE FACE,

06:33.564 --> 06:34.925
I--
(smack)

06:34.925 --> 06:36.627
(Bobby laughs)
CORRECT.

06:36.627 --> 06:39.530
THAT PERSON, WHICH IN THIS CASE
IS ME, WOULD BE OUT.

06:39.530 --> 06:40.771
HA! RIGHT IN THE PUSS!

06:40.771 --> 06:42.172
(smack)
OW!

06:42.172 --> 06:44.404
WHEN YOU THROW IT,
GIVE IT A LITTLE HEAT.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.106
(smack)
OH!

06:46.106 --> 06:48.879
OHH, MAN! RIGHT IN
THE SNACK BASKET! IS THAT LEGAL?

06:48.879 --> 06:50.811
(strained voice)
SURPRISINGLY, YES.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.413
I GUESS YOU'RE STILL ANGRY
ABOUT THE PRAYER THING?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.686
YEP. ANY BELIEVERS,
HELP ME OUT!

06:55.686 --> 06:56.887
(Grayson) OH!

06:59.650 --> 07:01.151
OW!

07:05.055 --> 07:06.627
SO, UH, HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET?

07:06.627 --> 07:08.829
I WAS SURFIN',
AND I DROPPED IN ON HER.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.501
(laughs)
AS IS CUSTOM,

07:10.501 --> 07:11.802
I CAME OUT OF THE WATER
TO A PUNCH IN THE FACE.

07:11.802 --> 07:13.504
(groans) I SHOULD NOT HAVE
POPPED YOU.

07:13.504 --> 07:14.905
DID NOT SET A GOOD EXAMPLE

07:14.905 --> 07:17.468
FOR THE KIDS IN THE SURF CLUB
I WAS TEACHING.

07:17.468 --> 07:19.209
I'M GONNA GET
THE NEXT ROUND.

07:19.209 --> 07:21.942
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A DOPPELGANGER.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.545
(laughs) SORRY. IS IT PEEKING
OUT OF MY SHORTS AGAIN?

07:24.545 --> 07:26.116
NOT A WORD FOR "PENIS."

07:26.116 --> 07:27.648
YOU TWO ARE TWINS.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.820
SHE EVEN WEARS
THE SAME FLIP-FLOPS.

07:29.820 --> 07:31.622
OH, THOSE ARE MINE.

07:31.622 --> 07:34.224
SHE LOST HERS DOING "KARATE KID"
CRANE KICKS OFF THE PIER.

07:34.224 --> 07:36.727
WELL, I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT
THE NEXT QUESTION IS.

07:36.727 --> 07:38.188
IS PAT MORITA DEAD?

07:38.188 --> 07:41.692
OR... WHEN ARE YOU ASKING
HER OUT?

07:41.692 --> 07:44.795
HA! RIGGS IS MY BUDDY.
SHE'S PRACTICALLY A DUDE.

07:44.795 --> 07:47.768
I MEAN, SHE DOES HAVE
AN OKAY SET OF DOPPELGANGERS.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.900
WHAT?

07:49.900 --> 07:52.543
LITTLE BIT.
OH!

07:52.543 --> 07:54.775
ARE YOU DRESSING LIKE THAT
IN PUBLIC NOW TO PUNISH ME?

07:54.775 --> 07:56.777
AW, YOU NOTICED.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.849
HOLD MY HAND.
SO IF I PUT MY HOODIE UP,

07:58.849 --> 08:01.912
IT'LL LOOK LIKE YOU'RE WALKING
WITH A DUDE.

08:01.912 --> 08:04.184
(laughs) WARDROBE PUNISHMENTS?
PLEASE.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.557
IF YOU REALLY WANNA
GET BACK AT A MAN,

08:06.557 --> 08:08.088
SCARE HIM
WITH A PREGNANCY TEST.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.921
I'VE GOT A WHOLE BOX
OF OLD POSITIVES AT MY HOUSE.

08:10.921 --> 08:13.624
YOU'RE AN AMERICAN TREASURE.
OH, THANK YOU.

08:13.624 --> 08:15.165
WHY AM I A BAD GUY

08:15.165 --> 08:17.568
FOR WANTING MY HOT, SEXY WIFE
TO SHOW IT OFF A LITTLE?

08:17.568 --> 08:19.770
I MEAN, UH...
LOOK AT THAT GIRL.

08:19.770 --> 08:21.902
VERY CLASSY, BUT THOSE JEANS
ARE PERFECT.

08:21.902 --> 08:25.075
WOW. SHE'S GOT A--
A ROCKIN' BUTT.

08:25.075 --> 08:27.538
DAMN!

08:27.538 --> 08:30.611
(gasps) OH! OH, NO, NO, NO, NO!
OH! SHE'S JUST A KID!

08:30.611 --> 08:33.844
FROM THE BACK, SHE LOOKS 25,
BUT FROM THE FRONT, SHE'S 14.

08:33.844 --> 08:36.887
AH, SHE'S A 25-14.
(whispering) 25-14.

08:36.887 --> 08:38.749
OH, I FEEL SICK.

08:38.749 --> 08:40.921
JUST THIS ONCE, LET IT GO.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.595
I TOTALLY THINK
SHE'D GIVE YOU HER NUMBER.

08:44.595 --> 08:46.727
YOU KNOW, IF HER MOM GAVE HER
A CELL PHONE

08:46.727 --> 08:48.759
FOR EMERGENCIES OR SOMETHING.

08:48.759 --> 08:49.960
COME ON.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.563
(laughing)

08:56.036 --> 08:57.267
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

08:57.267 --> 08:59.840
NOTHING.
(laughs)

08:59.840 --> 09:02.542
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ANYTHING.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.074
I MEAN, EVEN MR. BEAKINGTON
BELIEVES

09:04.074 --> 09:06.216
IN A WIND GOD OF SOME KIND.

09:06.216 --> 09:08.949
WHERE IS THAT GROSS BIRD?
HE SORT OF TOOK OVER UPSTAIRS.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.621
THAT'S WHY
WE'RE SLEEPING DOWN HERE.

09:10.621 --> 09:13.053
LOOK, I'M GLAD YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN,

09:13.053 --> 09:16.126
BUT I SEE THE WORLD AS A PLACE
WHERE THINGS JUST HAPPEN.

09:16.126 --> 09:19.690
WE'RE GONNA FIND YOU SOME FAITH
AND JAM IT DOWN YOUR THROAT.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.231
SEEMS LIKE
A HEALTHY APPROACH.

09:21.231 --> 09:22.933
ARE WE REALLY HAVING
A GROUP DISCUSSION

09:22.933 --> 09:24.564
ABOUT SPIRITUALITY?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.296
LAST SATURDAY, WE SPENT
THE NIGHT DEBATING

09:26.296 --> 09:29.099
WHO WOULD WIN A FIGHT BETWEEN
CARTOON CHARACTERS.

09:29.099 --> 09:31.942
THERE'S NO DEBATE!
BUGS IS TOO CRAFTY.

09:31.942 --> 09:34.574
GRAPE APE IS 40 FEET TALL!

09:34.574 --> 09:36.947
LISTEN!
ANDY AND I ARE RELIGIOUS.

09:36.947 --> 09:38.909
BUT I AM NEW ENGLAND CATHOLIC,

09:38.909 --> 09:41.251
AND HE IS... (whispers)
LATIN AMERICAN CATHOLIC.

09:41.251 --> 09:43.013
(normal voice) SO I PRAY,

09:43.013 --> 09:44.354
AND WHEN HIS FAMILY WANTS
TO TALK TO GOD,

09:44.354 --> 09:46.256
THEY SACRIFICE A CHICKEN.

09:46.256 --> 09:48.088
MY GRANDMOTHER KILLED
THAT CHICKEN FOR DINNER.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.990
SHE WAS SPEAKING IN TONGUES.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.792
SHE WAS SPEAKING SPANISH!

09:51.792 --> 09:54.324
YOU KNOW, I'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN EXPERIMENTING AT SCHOOL.

09:54.324 --> 09:56.366
(gasps) I TOTALLY CALLED THAT!

09:56.366 --> 09:58.699
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
IS HE CUTE?

09:58.699 --> 10:01.331
I MEANT WITH RELIGION.

10:01.331 --> 10:05.075
AW, MAN! I WAS EXCITED TO SHOW
YOU HOW COOL I'D BE ABOUT IT.

10:05.075 --> 10:06.777
MY FIRST STEPDAD WAS JEWISH,

10:06.777 --> 10:08.338
WHICH IS WHY I DON'T DRIVE
ON SHABBAT.

10:08.338 --> 10:10.681
BUT STEPDADS TWO THROUGH FIVE

10:10.681 --> 10:14.384
WERE METHODIST, BUDDHIST,
QUAKER, AND SNAKE CHARMER,

10:14.384 --> 10:16.116
SO RELIGIOUSLY, I'M, LIKE,
ONE OF THOSE FOUNTAIN DRINKS

10:16.116 --> 10:18.018
THAT YOU JUST PUT A SPLASH
OF EVERY SODA IN

10:18.018 --> 10:19.389
UNTIL YOUR CUP IS FULL.

10:19.389 --> 10:23.053
MMM. I FIND YOUR BELIEF SYSTEM
DELICIOUS.

10:23.053 --> 10:25.295
THIS HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

10:27.858 --> 10:29.229
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:29.229 --> 10:31.401
I AM GONNA SAY SOMETHING
TO THAT LITTLE HUSSY

10:31.401 --> 10:34.164
WHO HAS BEEN WAGGING HER ASS
AROUND FOR ANDY.

10:35.706 --> 10:38.709
HER? SHE'S A KID.

10:38.709 --> 10:40.370
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.312
SHE IS JUST FLAUNTING IT,

10:42.312 --> 10:43.944
WAITING FOR
SOME WEALTHY GUY

10:43.944 --> 10:46.416
TO TAKE HER ON A SHOPPING SPREE
AT CLAIRE'S.

10:46.416 --> 10:49.079
OKAY, HERE SHE COMES. I'M GONNA
PUSH HER IN THE FOUNTAIN.

10:49.079 --> 10:50.350
SHE'S, LIKE, 14.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.823
WHEN I WAS 14, I BARELY...

10:52.823 --> 10:55.956
NO, SCRATCH THAT. I WAS ACTUALLY
LIVING WITH A GUY.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.928
LOOK AT HER.

10:57.928 --> 10:59.659
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK LIKE
A PSYCHO.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.361
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
HELLO.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.663
HI.
MM.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.335
SEE? I TOLD YOU.

11:05.335 --> 11:07.267
ENJOY THE VIEW.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.840
YOUR HUSBAND DID.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.071
(whispers) DAMN!
UH...

11:11.071 --> 11:14.244
SHE'S GOT GAME!

11:14.244 --> 11:15.706
OOH!
OW!

11:15.706 --> 11:17.778
THOSE TWO ARE IDIOTS.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.911
I MEAN, NEITHER ONE CAN SEE HOW
GREAT THEY ARE FOR EACH OTHER.

11:20.911 --> 11:23.714
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD
BE BOBBY'S PERFECT WOMAN--

11:23.714 --> 11:26.156
WHICH IS TOTALLY
COST-PROHIBITIVE--

11:26.156 --> 11:28.058
I WOULD BE LIKE HER.

11:28.058 --> 11:30.260
WELL, I'M GLAD IT'S ONLY
THE MONEY HOLDING YOU BACK.

11:30.260 --> 11:33.263
LOOK, WE JUST GOTTA GET HIM
TO STOP THINKING OF RIGGS

11:33.263 --> 11:37.297
AS A DRINKING BUDDY AND START
SEEING HER AS A WO-MAN.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.429
(gasps) OH, MY GOD!
PLEASE SAY "MAKEOVER"!

11:39.429 --> 11:42.833
(Haim's "Forever" playing)

11:48.078 --> 11:49.339
в™Є HEY, YOU в™Є

11:49.339 --> 11:51.812
в™Є REMEMBER ME? в™Є

11:51.812 --> 11:53.914
в™Є REMEMBER LOVE? в™Є

11:53.914 --> 11:56.086
в™Є REMEMBER TRYING
TO STAY TOGETHER? в™Є

11:56.086 --> 11:58.218
в™Є FOREVER I TRY
TO MAKE IT RIGHT в™Є

11:58.218 --> 12:00.220
в™Є TOGETHER WE SUCK,
END IN SIGHT в™Є

12:00.220 --> 12:02.092
в™Є I'M TIRED
OF FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT в™Є

12:02.092 --> 12:03.293
в™Є IF YOU SAY THE WORD,
THEN I'LL SAY GOOD-BYE в™Є

12:03.293 --> 12:05.295
WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

12:05.295 --> 12:07.457
WE WANT YOU TO MEET...

12:07.457 --> 12:09.429
THE NEW RIGGS!

12:11.061 --> 12:12.963
OKAY, COME ON, RIGGS.

12:12.963 --> 12:14.334
COME ON, RIGGS.
DON'T BE SHY.

12:14.334 --> 12:19.339
в™Єв™Єв™Є

12:19.339 --> 12:21.511
(sighs)

12:21.511 --> 12:24.775
(laughing)

12:24.775 --> 12:26.246
THAT IS HILARIOUS!

12:26.246 --> 12:28.779
THAT'S LIKE PUTTING SUNGLASSES
ON A DOG!

12:28.779 --> 12:31.351
(laughing) I KNOW, RIGHT?!
(laughs and mutters)

12:31.351 --> 12:32.823
I'LL SEE YOU, GUYS.
(Travis) BYE.

12:32.823 --> 12:34.524
(Riggs and Bobby laugh)

12:34.524 --> 12:37.087
IT ALWAYS WORKS IN MOVIES.

12:37.087 --> 12:39.359
(scuffs shoe)

12:39.359 --> 12:42.362
THERE IS NO WAY THAT YOU COULD
LOOK OUT AT ALL OF THIS BEAUTY

12:42.362 --> 12:45.435
AND NOT BELIEVE
IN SOME KIND OF HIGHER POWER.

12:45.435 --> 12:48.498
YEAH, BUT, UM, WHAT'S UP
WITH ALL THE SEAGULLS?

12:48.498 --> 12:50.170
THEY SEEM
REALLY FOCUSED ON US.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.072
I DON'T KNOW.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.474
WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU HAVE CRACKERS?

12:54.474 --> 12:56.346
YEAH. I BORROWED THIS JACKET
FROM ELLIE.

12:56.346 --> 12:59.779
WELL, GET RID OF 'EM.
OH. OKAY.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.081
(seagulls squawking)

13:01.081 --> 13:02.813
OH, NO.

13:02.813 --> 13:04.784
GO, JULES. GO.
TOM CRUISE RUN!

13:04.784 --> 13:07.787
GO, JULES, GO! GO!

13:07.787 --> 13:09.119
GO!

13:09.119 --> 13:10.390
TOM CRUISE RUN!

13:10.390 --> 13:13.263
AAH! (screaming)

13:18.128 --> 13:19.399
AAH! (whimpering)

13:19.399 --> 13:20.901
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
TAKE IT EASY!

13:20.901 --> 13:22.802
TAKE IT EASY.
IT'S JUST BIG LOU.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.976
EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES,
I JUST SEE THEM EVERYWHERE.

13:28.378 --> 13:30.440
NOPE. NO FLOOR-BED FOR YOU.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.512
YOU CAN HANG OUT UPSTAIRS
WITH MR. B.

13:32.512 --> 13:36.216
YOU KNOW, HE PRETENDS HE WASN'T
INVOLVED IN THE ATTACK, BUT...

13:36.216 --> 13:39.319
I SAW ELLIE'S SWEATSHIRT
IN THE NEST HE'S BUILDING.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.051
WHY YOU MAD AT ME?

13:41.051 --> 13:43.093
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE STILL
ON THIS FAITH THING.

13:43.093 --> 13:44.925
LOOK, I'M SORRY I CAN'T JUST
MAGICALLY START BELIEVING

13:44.925 --> 13:46.356
WHATEVER YOU DO.

13:46.356 --> 13:48.598
DO YOU THINK THAT
I SIGNED UP FOR DODGEBALL

13:48.598 --> 13:50.430
BECAUSE I WANTED TO?

13:50.430 --> 13:53.133
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY WORST NIGHTMARE IS?

13:53.133 --> 13:55.906
IS IT BEING ATTACKED
BY A THOUSAND BIRDS?

13:55.906 --> 13:58.869
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY OTHER WORST NIGHTMARE IS?

13:58.869 --> 14:01.611
BEING HIT IN THE FACE
BY BALLS.

14:01.611 --> 14:04.274
NO, NO. STILL TOO SOON.

14:04.274 --> 14:08.378
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO SUDDENLY BELIEVE WHAT I DO.

14:08.378 --> 14:11.121
BUT IF WE'RE
REALLY PARTNERS,

14:11.121 --> 14:13.623
AND SOMETHING'S
IMPORTANT TO ME,

14:13.623 --> 14:16.856
SHOULDN'T YOU AT LEAST
BE OPEN TO IT?

14:19.990 --> 14:21.591
OH.

14:21.591 --> 14:24.134
(gasps and screams)

14:26.466 --> 14:28.338
RIGGS LOOKED AWESOME.
WHY'D YOU LAUGH?

14:28.338 --> 14:30.170
I ALWAYS LAUGH
AT DUDES IN DRESSES.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.072
IT'S A STAPLE
OF BRITISH COMEDY.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.004
BUT DON'T YOU SEE
HOW CUTE SHE IS?

14:34.004 --> 14:37.207
ESPECIALLY AFTER I REALIZED THAT
MAKEUP-WISE, SHE'S AN AUTUMN?

14:37.207 --> 14:38.648
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

14:38.648 --> 14:40.550
BUT I THINK RIGGS
IS AWESOME.

14:40.550 --> 14:42.652
I JUST DON'T HAVE THE URGE
TO BUMP DOPPELGANGERS WITH HER.

14:42.652 --> 14:44.184
WE'RE BUDS.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.216
BUT WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT
TO DATE A BUDDY?

14:46.216 --> 14:47.918
MAYBE THAT'S WHY

14:47.918 --> 14:49.589
YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
HAVEN'T WORKED OUT LATELY--

14:49.589 --> 14:51.461
YOU'VE NEVER DATED A GIRL
YOU WERE FRIENDS WITH FIRST.

14:51.461 --> 14:55.225
FINDING A GIRL WHO JUST WANTS
TO GET NAKED AND HOOK UP--

14:55.225 --> 14:56.466
THAT'S AWESOME.

14:56.466 --> 14:57.928
YEAH, IT IS!
YEAH, IT IS!

14:57.928 --> 14:59.129
(laughs)
YOU RIGHT! YOU RIGHT!

14:59.129 --> 15:00.630
STILL... FINDING A GIRL

15:00.630 --> 15:03.373
YOU CAN TALK TO FOR HOURS
AND NOT STOP LAUGHING?

15:03.373 --> 15:07.207
SOMEBODY WHO ALREADY CARES
ENOUGH TO TAKE A BULLET FOR YOU?

15:07.207 --> 15:09.379
THAT'S TOUGH TO COME BY.

15:09.379 --> 15:11.681
HMM.

15:11.681 --> 15:15.285
WAIT.
WHAT AM I DOING AGAIN?

15:15.285 --> 15:17.687
YOU'RE BACKUP IN CASE WE NEED
TO THROW A BEATDOWN

15:17.687 --> 15:19.289
ON THIS GIRL AND HER FRIENDS.

15:19.289 --> 15:21.051
WHAT?

15:21.051 --> 15:23.653
OH. CAN WE SWITCH PLACES?
MY GIRL LOOKS LIKE A BRAWLER.

15:27.257 --> 15:29.229
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

15:29.229 --> 15:31.931
NOTHIN'. I'M JUST STANDING HERE.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.703
YOU GOT A PROBLEM?

15:33.703 --> 15:36.066
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU GOT A PROBLEM?

15:43.573 --> 15:46.446
(whispers)
HI. I'M MRS. COBB.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.947
(normal voice)
YOU'RE REALLY CUTE.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.120
OH! PFFT.
PFFT!

15:50.120 --> 15:53.083
OH, THAT IS IT.
IT IS ON, LADIES.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.025
MOM!

15:57.627 --> 16:00.360
THAT WAS THE STERNEST TALKING-TO
I'VE RECEIVED

16:00.360 --> 16:02.492
IN QUITE SOME TIME.

16:02.492 --> 16:04.094
SHE'S A GOOD MOM.

16:04.094 --> 16:06.066
WHEN SHE SAID SHE WAS
DISAPPOINTED IN US,

16:06.066 --> 16:08.098
I REALLY FELT IT.

16:08.098 --> 16:10.500
I CAN'T COMPETE
WITH A 14-YEAR-OLD'S BUTT.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.202
I CAN ONLY HOPE
THAT WHEN SHE'S 20,

16:12.202 --> 16:14.704
AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY
WILL DESTROY IT.

16:14.704 --> 16:16.746
WHAT IS THIS REALLY ABOUT?

16:16.746 --> 16:18.208
WELL, IN ALL THE YEARS
I'VE KNOWN ANDY,

16:18.208 --> 16:21.111
HE'S NEVER LOOKED AT ANYONE
BUT ME.

16:21.111 --> 16:24.614
HAVE YOU...
SEEN YOURSELF RECENTLY?

16:24.614 --> 16:28.218
YOU'RE DRESSING LIKE
A LADY WHO WOULD DO STUFF

16:28.218 --> 16:30.090
FOR JUST... (whispers)
A LITTLE BIT OF CRACK.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.991
LAURIE!

16:31.991 --> 16:33.693
SHE'S RIGHT, SWEETIE.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.725
ANDY WORSHIPS
THE GROUND YOU WALK ON,

16:35.725 --> 16:38.628
BUT YOU GOTTA TRY A LITTLE.

16:38.628 --> 16:40.100
UH...

16:40.100 --> 16:42.702
WHAT IS THIS,
LINED WITH CRACKERS?!

16:42.702 --> 16:46.076
(scoffs and crunches)

16:46.076 --> 16:49.209
SINCE WE'VE ONLY PRACTICED ONCE,
I HAVE TO ASK--

16:49.209 --> 16:51.411
HAS ANYONE EVER DIED HERE
PLAYING DODGEBALL?

16:51.411 --> 16:54.544
JUST ONCE, BUT NOT IN A GAME.
THE ROOF COLLAPSED.

16:54.544 --> 16:56.686
THEY FIXED IT.

16:56.686 --> 16:58.488
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW WORKED
ON THE NEW ROOF,

16:58.488 --> 17:00.490
AND HE'S A COMPLETE IDIOT.

17:00.490 --> 17:03.153
ALL RIGHT!
LET'S KICK SOME ASS!

17:03.153 --> 17:05.695
(laughs) THERE YOU GO.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.431
UHH!

17:13.163 --> 17:16.506
THIS IS SO TRUMP, YOU GUYS.

17:16.506 --> 17:18.368
(indistinct conversations)

17:18.368 --> 17:20.140
EVERYONE READY?!

17:20.140 --> 17:22.272
OH, WILL YOU GIVE ME
ONE SEC?

17:24.274 --> 17:28.078
в™Єв™Єв™Є

17:53.843 --> 17:55.445
IS THAT FOR ME?

17:55.445 --> 17:57.277
ENJOY THE VIEW.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.080
ON MY WHISTLE!

18:05.155 --> 18:06.386
(blows whistle)

18:06.386 --> 18:10.190
(all shouting indistinctly)

18:14.464 --> 18:16.266
(high-pitched voice) WHOO!
(referee) OUT!

18:18.468 --> 18:19.729
UHH!

18:19.729 --> 18:24.334
WHOO! WHOO! WHOO!

18:24.334 --> 18:26.506
I HATE THIS!
I HATE THIS!

18:26.506 --> 18:28.338
(mouth full) OUT!

18:28.338 --> 18:31.541
WHOO! AAH!
UH-OH! OHH!

18:36.386 --> 18:37.587
(gasps) OH!

18:37.587 --> 18:39.749
(Jules)
OH, GOD! I HATE THIS!

18:39.749 --> 18:42.552
OHH! (grunts)

18:46.125 --> 18:47.327
(slow-motion voice) NO!

18:48.628 --> 18:50.330
(thud)

18:50.330 --> 18:51.901
(panting)
RIGGS!

18:51.901 --> 18:53.803
W--YOU TOOK THAT FOR ME.

18:53.803 --> 18:55.735
(both grunt)

18:55.735 --> 18:57.467
UHH!
NO!

18:57.467 --> 18:58.768
WHAT'S YOUR FIRST NAME?

18:58.768 --> 19:00.740
LISA.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.412
(panting)

19:02.412 --> 19:05.475
(Jules) NO! AAH!

19:05.475 --> 19:08.318
UHH!

19:08.318 --> 19:09.849
THAT WAS WORTH IT.
(laughs)

19:12.151 --> 19:13.383
THAT WAS SO SWEET!

19:13.383 --> 19:15.625
AAH! HE MISSED! I HATE IT!

19:15.625 --> 19:17.387
ALL RIGHT, JULES,
YOU CAN DO THIS!

19:17.387 --> 19:18.758
I CAN'T! AAH!

19:18.758 --> 19:20.660
ALL RIGHT,
UP, UP, UP, UP, UP.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.432
GRAB HANDS. GRAB HANDS.
(Laurie) WHAT? WHAT?

19:22.432 --> 19:24.394
NO!
CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND SAY A PRAYER FOR JULES.

19:24.394 --> 19:25.835
COME ON.
OKAY. OKAY.

19:25.835 --> 19:28.298
(grunts) AW! (laughs)

19:28.298 --> 19:30.240
UHH!
OW!

19:30.240 --> 19:32.872
OOH! OOH! THAT WAS A HEAD SHOT!
HE'S OUT! THAT GUY'S OUT!

19:32.872 --> 19:34.274
GREAT JOB, JULES!

19:34.274 --> 19:37.407
WHAT?! MY EARS ARE RINGING!

19:37.407 --> 19:38.848
(smack)
OH!

19:38.848 --> 19:40.280
AH! HEAD SHOT! HE'S OUT!
OOH!

19:40.280 --> 19:41.551
(Ellie) THAT GUY'S OUT!

19:41.551 --> 19:44.754
MR. BEAKINGTON, YOU CAME!

19:44.754 --> 19:47.217
UHH!
OH!

19:47.217 --> 19:50.189
HEAD SHOT! WE WIN! WE WIN!
YEAH!

19:51.391 --> 19:55.194
(cheering)

19:57.627 --> 20:00.670
WHEN YOUR EYES WERE CLOSED
AND YOU WERE PRAYING,

20:00.670 --> 20:03.603
WHAT WAS IN YOUR HEAD?

20:03.603 --> 20:05.775
I WAS THINKING GOOD THOUGHTS
FOR YOU.

20:05.775 --> 20:07.607
MM.

20:07.607 --> 20:08.808
I FIGURED THAT COULD BE
MY VERSION OF PRAYER, YOU KNOW?

20:08.808 --> 20:11.941
MM. I LIKE THAT.

20:11.941 --> 20:14.384
HMM.
(chuckles)

20:14.384 --> 20:16.316
GOOD NIGHT.

20:17.747 --> 20:19.889
(sighs) AHH.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.293
(gasps) AAH!

20:24.754 --> 20:26.496
OH.
(exhales)

20:26.496 --> 20:28.628
DAMN BIRDS.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.460
(groans)

20:35.405 --> 20:37.807
GLAD THE SEAGULLS
ARE FINALLY GONE.

20:37.807 --> 20:40.270
YEAH, THE CITY COUNCIL
DIDN'T CONSULT ME

20:40.270 --> 20:42.412
ON THEIR DECISION TO INTRODUCE
STARVING FALCONS

20:42.412 --> 20:44.574
INTO THE GULFHAVEN AIRSPACE,

20:44.574 --> 20:47.547
BUT AS MAYOR, I...

20:47.547 --> 20:48.978
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:48.978 --> 20:51.481
I CHANGED THE RULES,
HAD LAURIE SEND A TWEET OUT.

20:51.481 --> 20:52.882
THANK YOU, EVERYONE,
FOR PARTICIPATING!

20:52.882 --> 20:55.485
(cheering)

20:55.485 --> 20:56.726
(high-pitched voice)
COME ON!

20:56.726 --> 20:58.458
I ALSO ADDED THIS

20:58.458 --> 20:59.859
WHEN YOU SAY...
(high-pitched voice) COME ON!

20:59.859 --> 21:02.432
(all, high-pitched voice)
COME ON!
