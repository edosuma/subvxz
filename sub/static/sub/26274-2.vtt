until Shawn goes into shock?

32:32.714 --> 32:34.915
Well, according to the doctor,
about an hour?

32:35.817 --> 32:37.319
Well, I'm not waiting another minute.

32:37.320 --> 32:39.788
- We have to go after Jonny.
- We have nothing on him.

32:39.789 --> 32:42.090
This may be a long shot...

32:42.091 --> 32:43.492
The ransom letter?

32:43.493 --> 32:45.193
That's a little bit
besides the point isn't it?

32:45.194 --> 32:47.763
- Not if we can tie him to it.
- There are a lot of typewriters

32:47.764 --> 32:49.531
- in Toronto, Frankie.
- OK. Look at this

33:07.450 --> 33:08.950
- Oh...
- Dressed like that?

33:08.951 --> 33:10.886
Oh, it's actually
kind of a funny story.

33:10.887 --> 33:12.419
Hopefully a short funny story.

33:13.522 --> 33:15.757
Uh, I was leaving the dance
marathon at the Palais

33:15.758 --> 33:17.459
when I remembered
that I left my key at work,

33:17.460 --> 33:19.161
so here I am.

33:19.162 --> 33:21.897
Well, I was woken
from my blissful slumber

33:21.898 --> 33:23.998
to conduct an autopsy
on some John Doe.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.768
If people are going
to insist on dying, I wish

33:26.769 --> 33:28.537
they'd do it during daylight hours.

33:28.538 --> 33:30.338
Very inconsiderate, sir.

33:30.339 --> 33:32.307
Did you find anything interesting?

33:32.308 --> 33:34.142
- Interesting?
- About the body.

33:34.143 --> 33:36.912
If this is your idea
of kissing up, it isn't working.

33:36.913 --> 33:38.914
I understand sir, you're tired.

33:38.915 --> 33:41.917
Why don't I file
that autopsy report for you?

33:41.918 --> 33:43.985
- I couldn't ask you to do that.
- Oh, you're not asking,

33:43.986 --> 33:46.121
I'm offering. That way,
you can speed your way

33:46.122 --> 33:48.223
- back to slumber town.
- Well, I won't argue

33:48.224 --> 33:50.692
with you, Mrs. Chakowitz.
Appreciate it.

33:50.693 --> 33:52.426
Oh, all in a night's work, sir.

33:53.662 --> 33:54.663

34:08.110 --> 34:10.212
I wanted to introduce you

- Trudy Clarke.

She has a great voice that I

It can definitely wait. Just come back

My father always said
I should have another job

34:30.333 --> 34:31.333
Why do I care?

34:31.333 --> 34:33.300
Because it matches this.

34:36.871 --> 34:37.972
The ransom note.

I don't know anything
about that. Who are you two?

- Private detectives.
- We believe that you're

34:43.646 --> 34:45.147
behind the kidnapping,
and that you killed

- your partner in crime.
- Applesauce.

34:47.617 --> 34:50.152
- Phonus Balonus.
- You were on the boardwalk

34:50.152 --> 34:51.987
between eight and nine,
when Ed was killed.

34:51.987 --> 34:55.089
Ed? The janitor, Ed?

34:55.991 --> 34:57.591
Why'd you kill him, Jonny?

34:58.827 --> 35:00.996
You girls are crackers.
I didn't kill Ed.

35:00.997 --> 35:02.531
You've got nothing on me!

35:02.532 --> 35:04.199
Well, perhaps we should
call the police

35:04.200 --> 35:05.767
and they can bring you
in for questioning.

35:05.768 --> 35:08.103

You being led out in handcuffs?

35:08.104 --> 35:09.204
(SIGHING)

35:10.105 --> 35:12.040
You want to know where I was
between eight and nine?

35:12.041 --> 35:14.676
Fine. I was having a little parlez

35:14.677 --> 35:16.444
with a certain
hairy-knuckled gentleman

35:16.445 --> 35:18.279
about a certain outstanding loan.

35:19.181 --> 35:20.281
Prove it.

35:21.183 --> 35:23.718
Well, I normally
charge extra for this,

35:23.719 --> 35:25.853
but as we're all friends here...

35:27.455 --> 35:28.789
There's your proof.

35:30.926 --> 35:32.627
Well, what's the name
of this loan shark?

35:32.628 --> 35:34.168
We'll see if he backs up your story.

35:35.163 --> 35:36.565
Even if he could talk now,

35:36.566 --> 35:38.733
he wouldn't speak to a female PI.

35:38.734 --> 35:40.535
Fine, we'll call the police.

35:40.536 --> 35:42.636
No, wait. Wait.

35:43.939 --> 35:46.241
Maybe there was someone.
When I was coming back

35:46.242 --> 35:49.010
from my little parlez...

35:49.011 --> 35:51.812
I saw this girl coming up
the boardwalk and she saw me.

35:52.981 --> 35:55.150
<i>She had fair hair,
and she had a gold dress,</i>

35:55.151 --> 35:56.852
<i>a glittery gold dress.</i>

35:56.853 --> 35:58.520
Was she wearing a number on her back?

35:58.521 --> 36:00.422
Yeah, I think so,
it had a shawl over it.

36:00.423 --> 36:03.491
But she was running, she was
running towards the Palais

36:03.492 --> 36:05.359
like she had the devil on her heels.

36:07.829 --> 36:08.929
What?

36:10.298 --> 36:11.566
Jennifer. A word please?

36:11.567 --> 36:13.368
I'm awfully tired. Can it wait?

36:13.369 --> 36:15.270
- I'm afraid it can't.
- If this concerns Jennifer,

36:15.271 --> 36:17.072
- it concerns me as well.
- Well, you might hear

36:17.073 --> 36:18.240
something you don't want to hear.

36:18.241 --> 36:19.773
Well, I won't leave her side.

36:21.877 --> 36:24.179
You plotted with Ed to kidnap Thomas,

36:24.180 --> 36:26.147
but he screwed up
and took the wrong guy.

36:26.148 --> 36:28.250
Then Ed came back
to talk it over with you.

36:28.251 --> 36:30.485
- I beg your pardon?
- We know that you met him

36:30.486 --> 36:32.354
- at 8:30.
- I did not.

36:32.355 --> 36:34.356
- We have a witness.
- No, that's impossible.

36:34.357 --> 36:37.325
She was in the ballroom at 8:30.
She was dancing with me.

36:37.326 --> 36:39.427
No, Mr. Enfield. Don't you remember,

36:39.428 --> 36:41.095
you were dancing with me at that time.

36:45.367 --> 36:48.403
- You two planned this together.
- No. That's ridiculous.

36:48.404 --> 36:49.784
But then why would you kill Ed?

36:51.072 --> 36:52.707
Uh, what? What do you...

36:52.708 --> 36:55.043
what do you... what do you mean?
Ed's... Ed's dead?

36:55.044 --> 36:57.212
- What?
- You didn't tell him?

36:57.213 --> 36:59.180
It...

36:59.181 --> 37:01.016
was an accident. I...

37:01.017 --> 37:03.418
I didn't take anything. I took
the guy you told me to take!

37:03.419 --> 37:05.353
And another thing,
I'm not going down for this.

37:05.354 --> 37:06.488
You owe me!

37:06.489 --> 37:08.423
I told Ed that we needed
to free Shawn,

37:08.424 --> 37:10.492
and he wanted to just
leave him there to die.

37:10.493 --> 37:13.428
So we argued, and Ed flew into a rage

37:13.429 --> 37:14.796
and came rushing at me.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.031
And you pushed him.

37:16.032 --> 37:17.432
- Give me my money!
- No!

37:17.433 --> 37:18.533
(SCREAMING)

37:22.370 --> 37:25.172

He did the rest.

37:26.508 --> 37:28.876
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was trying to protect you.

37:30.045 --> 37:31.345
Thomas.

37:35.650 --> 37:38.920
She's not from... the "right" family,

37:38.921 --> 37:41.089
not to marry an Enfield.

37:41.090 --> 37:43.625
We decided to run away together.

37:43.626 --> 37:45.060
We needed money to get us started,

37:45.061 --> 37:46.094
so we came up with this scheme.

37:46.095 --> 37:47.896
But we had no idea how to pull it off.

37:47.897 --> 37:49.197
And that's where Ed came in.

37:49.198 --> 37:51.433
I approached Ed. And he said

37:51.434 --> 37:53.601
that he would arrange
everything. And he even typed

37:53.602 --> 37:55.537
- the ransom note himself.
- It was our only chance

37:55.538 --> 37:57.605
at being together. I hope
you can understand that...

37:57.606 --> 37:58.907
Where is Shawn?

37:58.908 --> 38:01.009
I... I don't know.

38:01.010 --> 38:03.878
- Ed didn't tell you?
- He said that he stashed him

38:03.879 --> 38:06.715
someplace safe and that's all.
I swear to you,

38:06.716 --> 38:09.818
- that is all he said.
- You really had me fooled.

38:09.819 --> 38:11.653
I thought you actually
cared about Shawn.

38:11.654 --> 38:13.989
I couldn't feel more terribly
about what's happened.

38:13.990 --> 38:16.224
- I'm truly sorry.
- Well, I'll be sure

38:16.225 --> 38:18.492
to pass along your apology to Audrey.

38:20.295 --> 38:22.830
Mary, can you take them in there
and keep an eye on them?

38:24.132 --> 38:25.499
Come with me.

38:32.907 --> 38:34.376
You think Jennifer
is lying about Shawn?

38:34.377 --> 38:36.009
She has no reason to.

38:37.579 --> 38:40.015
News from the coroner.
Based on his injuries,

38:40.016 --> 38:42.017
he determined that Ed fell.
He wasn't pushed.

38:42.018 --> 38:43.685
So, she didn't lie about that part.

38:43.686 --> 38:44.853
But here's the strange thing:

38:44.854 --> 38:46.721
the coroner found
arsenic in his blood.

38:46.722 --> 38:49.290
- He was poisoned?
- No. It was a gradual buildup.

38:49.291 --> 38:51.693
Probably from long-term exposure.

38:51.694 --> 38:54.062
Well, the important thing
right now is finding Shawn.

38:54.063 --> 38:55.996
So we need to retrace Ed's steps.

38:57.966 --> 38:59.701
What exactly are we looking for?

39:01.470 --> 39:03.705

39:03.706 --> 39:06.007
Where would you guys hide someone?

39:06.008 --> 39:08.676
Well, first of all, it'd be
a place I know very well.

39:08.677 --> 39:10.578
A place I have access to

39:10.579 --> 39:12.746
and that no one
would be poking around.

39:13.882 --> 39:16.250

39:18.853 --> 39:21.256
It's Wildcat bottles.

39:21.257 --> 39:23.658
They've been out of business
for a long time.

39:23.659 --> 39:26.161
Funny. They used arsenic
in bottle making,

39:26.162 --> 39:28.129
to decolorize the glass.

39:28.130 --> 39:29.830
Maybe Ed used to work there...

39:31.199 --> 39:33.034
A place he knows very well.

39:33.035 --> 39:35.636
A place he still has access to.
