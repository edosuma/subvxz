No--no, please!

to yourself?

I'll just take it right off.

you told him?

- No. He asked me.
- Well, I didn't tell him.

if something happened.

to take the crumbs.

we get back up
on the chairs now?

05:35.603 --> 05:37.438
- New phone?
- Hey.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.139
- What the heck
are you doing here?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.841
- You didn't think I'd let
the whole summer go by

05:40.874 --> 05:43.711
without coming home, right?
- Um...

05:43.744 --> 05:45.779
- I'm, like, your only friend.

- Oh, thanks.

- Yeah, we could have been
doing it all summer,

05:52.620 --> 05:54.455
but somebody
had to go back to school,

05:54.488 --> 05:55.656
take more classes.

You sure you
didn't fall in love

05:57.525 --> 05:59.159
with some married
professor or something?

05:59.192 --> 06:02.463
- No, I don't catch feelings.
Ever.

06:02.496 --> 06:06.634
You could come back with me,
you know?

06:06.667 --> 06:10.738
We could get an apartment
off campus.

Come on, I'm so over
my suitemates.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.944

or sweetbreads

06:18.746 --> 06:21.549

the neck part of the cow?

06:21.582 --> 06:23.517
Probably breads, right?
'Cause it's counterintuitive.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.487
It's like the whole Iceland,
Greenland situation.

so you're just gonna keep

06:29.657 --> 06:32.760
living at home
with your mom in the past.

supposed to guess?

a recluse lately.

off online or anything

coming tonight, right?

that you were touched

07:19.773 --> 07:20.974
in a non-platonic way?

- I told you,
nobody understands me.

handle this dry spell.

- A snake.

to be grim.

- Yeah.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.016

and leave,

No, sorry.

I mean, if you
think about it though,

10:44.912 --> 10:47.180
that's kind of my type,
I guess.

10:51.819 --> 10:55.723
- I always have this dream
where I get attacked

10:55.756 --> 10:57.991
by a horde of puppies,
and they start eating me,

10:58.025 --> 11:00.060

It's horrible.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.162

what are you doing?

11:02.195 --> 11:03.931
Just do it like you're--

you know, like you're
moving through water.

poking at the ball and--

No!

11:12.906 --> 11:15.175

What are you doing?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.810
Don't do that.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.046
- Yeah, sorry.
You're probably right.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.447
Too weird.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.783
- What?
Come on, it's fine.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.919
Why are you
back in town anyway?

11:27.888 --> 11:30.057
- You ever heard
of the No-End House?

11:30.090 --> 11:32.159
- I have this nightmare where
I'd be at my grandma's house,

11:32.192 --> 11:35.929
and I'd be walking down this,
like, long hallway,

11:35.963 --> 11:38.165
and then at the end there'd be
this standing mirror,

11:38.198 --> 11:41.234
and there would always be
someone hiding behind it.

11:41.268 --> 11:44.004
And I'd wake up so scared
every time.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.840
- Yo, Margot,
show me your phone.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.075
- Why?

11:48.108 --> 11:51.078
[eerie music]

11:51.111 --> 11:53.080
- Last time it was in the U.S.
was six years ago,

11:53.113 --> 11:54.915
somewhere outside Detroit.

11:54.948 --> 11:58.952
Since then it's been in
Eastern Europe, South America.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.821
It just shows up.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.489
The only advanced warning
is people in the area

12:02.522 --> 12:06.259
start getting these teasers,
texts, a post on your Instagram.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.228
Most people have
no idea what it is,

12:08.261 --> 12:10.330
But in the past couple of days,
it's been happening here.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.899
This is, like, one in a million.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.000
- Yeah, I don't even know
where it is.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.167
There's no, like,
address on it.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.803
- Yeah, the address comes later.

12:15.836 --> 12:16.970
There'll be a commercial
or something.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.505
- I don't know.

12:18.538 --> 12:22.509
Sounds just like a super-bougie
haunted house to me.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.511
- It's six rooms,

12:24.544 --> 12:27.214
each is supposed to be scarier
than the last,

12:27.247 --> 12:28.949
but it's psychological.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.517
Gets in your head.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.953
Everybody who goes in
describes it totally different.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.988
Most people don't even make it
to the sixth room,

12:35.022 --> 12:37.991
and the people who do...

12:38.025 --> 12:39.259
never seen again.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.528
[laughter]

12:41.561 --> 12:44.231
- Definitely not.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.266
- Yeah, well,
you live and learn, right?

12:46.299 --> 12:49.102
- You live and learn.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.942
- I read that the nightmares
that you have as a kid

12:54.975 --> 12:57.010
are usually about
a fear of change.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.280
- Really?

13:00.313 --> 13:02.282
[both chuckle]

13:02.315 --> 13:05.118
Then mine were foreshadowing.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.023
- Do you want
to talk about it?

13:10.057 --> 13:13.560
- Mm.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.362
I don't really know you.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.933
- Yeah, I guess that's fair.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.369
- Do you remember in, like,
second grade,

13:22.402 --> 13:24.872
they'd take us into town
to the library?

13:24.905 --> 13:28.341
This one day Margot and I
found this book about myths,

13:28.375 --> 13:32.179
and there was this chapter
on the succubi,

13:32.212 --> 13:35.182
and all of a sudden

13:35.215 --> 13:39.119
my neck and ears got all warm...

13:41.021 --> 13:43.857
because, you know,
for whatever reason,

13:43.891 --> 13:47.895
that was just--you know,
it was like every urge

13:47.928 --> 13:52.265
and every impulse
and every scary adult feeling

13:52.299 --> 13:54.367
that I just
didn't understand yet.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.204
- I can see the appeal.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.210
- Tell me something
about yourself.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.147
- I grew up in foster homes.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.353
- What was that like?

14:13.386 --> 14:15.956
- I just felt different.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.390
You know?

14:17.424 --> 14:22.996
Because I was always trying
to blend in, make friends,

14:23.030 --> 14:27.467
I met a lot of different kids,
a lot of different homes.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.871
People come and go, you know?

14:46.419 --> 14:48.421
- My dad died.

14:52.425 --> 14:55.662
- What happened?

14:55.695 --> 14:58.065
- He had allergies.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.303
Imagine dying
from something so dumb.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.142
Yeah, he was taking
these prescription meds,

15:09.176 --> 15:11.211
and then he had a really bad
allergic reaction,

15:11.244 --> 15:13.913
and he fucking died.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.287
I actually found him.

15:20.320 --> 15:24.091
In there.

15:24.124 --> 15:27.394
- This hunter often
must begin full sprint

15:27.427 --> 15:29.296
from a half mile out

15:29.329 --> 15:31.999
just to hope to catch
a single member of the herd

15:32.032 --> 15:36.236
who got caught flatfooted
just a moment too long.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.172
And even with
the long lead time,

15:39.206 --> 15:41.274
cheetahs can spend
up to two miles

15:41.308 --> 15:43.010
in full-sprint pursuit

15:43.043 --> 15:46.313
before needing to rethink
and regroup.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.115
- The TV was still on

15:48.148 --> 15:52.119
like he had just fallen asleep
watching it, you know?

15:52.152 --> 15:53.353
It was last year,

15:53.386 --> 15:56.056
and I was supposed
to be home by ten.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.393
I always just think, like,

16:00.427 --> 16:04.364
if I had actually
just been home by ten,

16:04.397 --> 16:07.100
maybe...

16:08.068 --> 16:10.537
- Or maybe not.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.521
I'm getting chilly.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.794
- How you doing?
I knew this was my day.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.097
- What--what do you want?

16:37.130 --> 16:39.232
- That's an easy question.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.501
But I'm in a little bit
of a hurry,

16:41.534 --> 16:43.236
a little bit of a rush.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.272
- You--you're the convict.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.240
- I was, but I'm out now.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.575
I'm gonna stay out.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.244
And you're gonna help me.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.180
- You better get out of here.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.148
My husband will be back
in a few minutes.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.484
- Now you see, you're off
to a bad start already.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.518
Your--

16:58.551 --> 17:00.553
[distortion, whirring]

17:07.327 --> 17:09.362
[laughter, indistinct voices]

17:17.304 --> 17:19.339
[unsettling laughter]

[jingle plays]

17:28.581 --> 17:35.588
*

17:43.296 --> 17:45.432
- Out to get the harvest.

17:45.465 --> 17:48.868
Well, I think it was--
it's an Egyptian invention.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.138
- Oh, right.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.243
Margot?

17:56.276 --> 17:59.078
What's up?

18:02.149 --> 18:05.118
[suspenseful music]

18:05.152 --> 18:12.192
*

19:04.277 --> 19:05.945
- I don't know, man.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.282
- It's kind of a trip, right?
- Yeah, this place is dope.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.518
[overlapping chatter]

19:11.551 --> 19:15.422
*

19:19.426 --> 19:22.229
- Hey, how was it?
You guys have fun?

19:24.797 --> 19:26.599
- [retches]
- Oh.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.701
- You all right?
It's okay.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.938
- Okay. Ooh.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.241
- I heard they use
subliminal images

19:34.274 --> 19:36.709
and sub-aural sound waves
to make you more vulnerable.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.612
Totally messes with you
psychologically.

19:39.646 --> 19:43.283
- Could you simmer down, JT?
It's a haunted house.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.684
They just tricked you
into thinking it's special

19:44.717 --> 19:46.553
'cause they didn't
invite you.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.622
[indistinct chatter]

19:54.694 --> 19:56.429
- He wouldn't even
tell him though.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.565
- No way.
- That's crazy.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.267
- Oh.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.701
- Okay.
- Here we go.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.970
[indistinct chatter]

20:04.003 --> 20:07.740
- Hey, man. How'd you
hear about this place?

20:07.774 --> 20:09.576
- Been looking for it.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.010
- Come on.
- You're gonna go in for sure?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.679
- Yeah.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.747
- We heard it's crazy in there.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.016
- Boo!

20:17.049 --> 20:19.452
- I also heard they spray
the area with a hallucinogen,

20:19.486 --> 20:21.621
so we're all gonna be tripping
by the time we go in.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.357
- Oh, yeah,
it makes perfect sense.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.426
- [whimpering]

20:29.296 --> 20:31.464
- Ready as I'll ever be.
- Sure.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.268
[door shuts]

20:38.371 --> 20:40.640
- You guys gonna
make it through all the rooms?

20:40.673 --> 20:42.542
- Hell yeah.
[chuckles]

20:42.575 --> 20:44.644
[tense music]

20:44.677 --> 20:47.514
[lock squeals]
- Whoa.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.616
- Wait. Already?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.518
- Damn, did it eat them?

20:51.551 --> 20:53.853
[door opens]

20:53.886 --> 20:56.356
- You scare easy?

20:56.389 --> 20:58.725
- It depends on the type
of scare, I guess.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.361
- I guess we're gonna
find out.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.663
*

21:03.696 --> 21:05.665
[overlapping chatter]

21:05.698 --> 21:12.739
*

21:40.900 --> 21:43.436
- * Don't shake with fear

21:43.470 --> 21:45.572
* As I draw near

21:45.605 --> 21:48.841
* I'm just
a harmless creature *

21:48.875 --> 21:51.378
* Don't think me wild

21:51.411 --> 21:53.112
* I'm meek and mild

21:53.145 --> 21:54.881
* For weakness
is my feature... *

21:54.914 --> 21:56.849
- This isn't very scary.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.852
- * Please have
a little pity... *

21:59.886 --> 22:02.789
- Mitch...

22:02.822 --> 22:04.791
it's you.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.526
- Oh?
- Oh, my God.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.828
- Here's you, Tamara.
- Here's me.

22:08.861 --> 22:13.500
*

22:13.533 --> 22:14.834
- Oh, my God.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.536
I mean, it kind of
looks like me, right?

22:16.569 --> 22:18.938
- That's insane.
- I think that's yours.

22:18.971 --> 22:22.375
- * That disbanded in theory

22:22.409 --> 22:25.445
* I'm the gold from a farm

22:25.478 --> 22:29.749
* That were only out
for glory, glory, glory... *

22:29.782 --> 22:31.618
- That's crazy.

22:31.651 --> 22:34.954
- * Hallelujah, lujah,
money never talks *

22:34.987 --> 22:37.824
* In me you'll see
a novelty... *

22:37.857 --> 22:41.561
- That's weird,
my phone's freezing.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.563
- Mine too.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.898
*

22:45.932 --> 22:49.936
- * On salary day
they used to pray *

22:49.969 --> 22:53.706
* That I'd make my appearance

22:53.740 --> 22:55.475
* But railroad fares...

22:55.508 --> 22:57.710
- So wait, how did
they do this so fast?

22:57.744 --> 23:00.613
- They must watch us
while we're in line.

23:00.647 --> 23:03.416
Use some kind of 3-D printer

23:03.450 --> 23:05.985
and software that translates
our image.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.888
Fucking wow, dude,
this is brilliant.

23:08.921 --> 23:13.793
- * When I tell you that
I couldn't even pay this-- *

23:13.826 --> 23:15.628
[music stops]

23:15.662 --> 23:17.497
- I don't like this.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.432
There should be an exit light.
Where's the exit light?

23:19.466 --> 23:20.967
- Where's your hand?
- What?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.504
- It reminds me of that Douglas
Gordon installation, you know?

23:24.537 --> 23:27.507
[music continues, distorted]

23:27.540 --> 23:34.547

24:00.673 --> 24:05.745
*

24:05.778 --> 24:07.980
- I want to know
how they did that.

24:34.707 --> 24:38.645
- You know what?
No, forget it, I'm out.

24:40.913 --> 24:47.654
*

24:47.687 --> 24:49.822
- * Don't shake with fear

25:41.708 --> 25:44.043

for this place.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.912
I mean, the city must
know about it, right?

25:45.945 --> 25:47.346

They're actors.
Relax.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.855

I mean, they've got to be.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.580
- All right.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.883
You think he was
an actor too?

29:45.918 --> 29:47.786
- Yeah.

Hey, Margot.

29:53.860 --> 29:58.597
Hey, what--what did
he say to you back there?

29:58.630 --> 30:02.001
- He said,
"Welcome back, Martian."

30:05.237 --> 30:08.040
- Martian?

30:10.209 --> 30:12.845
Let's go home.

of the pool?
