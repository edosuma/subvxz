00:09.049 --> 00:11.920
I'm sure I have\Nseen her somewhere.

00:18.729 --> 00:21.399
She ruined my mood\Nas soon as she got in.

00:21.999 --> 00:24.170
She must be someone\Nwhom I fought with.

00:24.999 --> 00:26.670
I don't think she's\Nfrom my school.

00:27.900 --> 00:30.039
- It must have been brief.\N- Ms. Yoo.

00:30.970 --> 00:33.010

00:33.210 --> 00:34.210
Get in.

00:35.380 --> 00:36.609
Thank you.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.780
This is the patrol car.

00:43.789 --> 00:46.389
I heard that you've solved\Nthe arson case again.

00:46.859 --> 00:48.319
I respect you, Ms. Yoo.

00:50.530 --> 00:52.859
I respect you too,\NConstable Lee.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.770
How did you become\Na policeman?

00:56.829 --> 00:59.300
I always fail\Nthe police exam.

01:00.069 --> 01:01.439
I've failed\Nmany times too.

01:01.439 --> 01:03.710
I studied for three years\Nin Noryang-dong.

01:04.009 --> 01:05.108
Noryang-dong?

01:05.108 --> 01:07.210
I didn't study hard\Nfor the first two years.

01:09.079 --> 01:10.649
I studied hard in my\Nthird year because...

01:10.649 --> 01:11.949
there was a pretty girl\Nin the general class.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.119
Gosh. Should I join\Nthe general class also...

01:15.119 --> 01:17.750
to meet a handsome guy?

01:18.819 --> 01:21.089
Can you drop me off\Nat that bus stop?

01:21.789 --> 01:24.190
Where are you? Are you\Nsure you're not coming?

01:24.460 --> 01:25.860
Dad is waiting for you.

01:26.529 --> 01:27.729
Liar.

01:28.199 --> 01:30.699
Dad is happy\Nif I'm not around him.

01:40.809 --> 01:41.809

01:41.809 --> 01:43.509
Thanks to you, there's\Nno need for a lawsuit.

01:43.550 --> 01:45.479
Why don't we have dinner\Ntogether after this?

01:45.479 --> 01:46.619
Next time.

01:46.619 --> 01:47.850
You used to stick with me\Nall the time...

01:47.850 --> 01:49.080
when we were younger.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.720
Now that you're an adult,\Nwe can't even have a meal?

01:51.789 --> 01:53.520
Treat me something nice\Nnext time.

01:53.819 --> 01:55.720
Get me the most expensive\Nmeal now that you're CEO.

Sir, it's about to start.

01:57.460 --> 01:58.990

01:59.460 --> 02:01.059
Go in. You must be\Nbusy. Go inside.

02:23.920 --> 02:26.619

02:26.619 --> 02:28.020
Actually,

02:28.290 --> 02:30.589
I don't feel easy\Nright now.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.059
It's because...

02:33.659 --> 02:38.200
our previous president led\Nthe firm well for years.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.839
I wonder if I could...

02:39.839 --> 02:42.300
lead the firm well\Nlike how he did.

02:42.740 --> 02:44.369
I'm quite worried.

02:44.869 --> 02:47.040
But with your help,

02:47.179 --> 02:48.510
I can make Ha and Jung\NLaw Firm to arise...

02:48.510 --> 02:51.349
as a leading firm.

02:51.909 --> 02:53.779
I will do my best.

02:53.779 --> 02:55.480
I'd appreciate\Nyour help in this.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.390
As you know,

03:02.390 --> 03:04.760

03:06.659 --> 03:09.300

03:17.240 --> 03:18.510
- Call an ambulance.\N- Dad.

03:18.510 --> 03:19.779
- Call an ambulance.\N- Dad.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.080
You look better\Nwithout glasses.

04:31.609 --> 04:32.609

04:33.279 --> 04:34.479
You have a bad eye sight?

04:34.680 --> 04:36.419
These aren't prescription\Nglasses, are they?

04:36.589 --> 04:38.149
Are they for fashion?

04:39.120 --> 04:40.520
No, these are my glasses.

04:44.089 --> 04:45.460
Where do you get off?

04:45.690 --> 04:48.099
I'm not a weird woman.

04:49.229 --> 04:51.799
I get off at Noryang-dong.\NIt's the next stop.

04:51.799 --> 04:54.339
Gosh. It's a destiny.

04:55.969 --> 04:56.969
Gosh.

04:57.810 --> 04:59.440
I get off\Nat Noryang-dong too.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.180
Oh, I see. What a destiny.

05:11.589 --> 05:13.390
Why? Why do you keep\Nfollowing me? Why?

05:13.390 --> 05:15.020
Why? Why?\NWhat do you want?

05:15.020 --> 05:18.460

Okay. Can you hurry up?

05:29.810 --> 05:30.940
I'm late for my class.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.010

Gosh, it's not cooked yet.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.690

05:56.029 --> 05:57.870

05:58.969 --> 06:00.270
Have you changed\Nyour number?

06:00.270 --> 06:01.899
No, I'm borrowing\Nsomeone's phone.

06:01.899 --> 06:03.539
Have you lost your\Nphone again?

06:03.739 --> 06:05.210
You're not good\Nat anything...

06:05.210 --> 06:07.109

06:08.380 --> 06:11.109

Gosh, I'm busy.

06:17.320 --> 06:18.890
Where do I throw away\Nthe soup?

06:20.419 --> 06:22.419
Why are you bugging\Nme? I told you I'm busy.

I know you're busy,\Nbut you're a detective.

06:23.529 --> 06:25.460
You have to catch\Nthe criminal.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.630
I've caught this man\Nwho had a hidden camera.

06:28.700 --> 06:29.870
It's going to be\Ndone soon.

06:29.870 --> 06:31.169
He hid the camera\Nwith his glasses.

06:31.169 --> 06:32.469
It's not so new.

06:32.469 --> 06:34.739
This one is where you have\Na USB port on the leg.

06:34.799 --> 06:36.909
The black glasses\Nthat are out of fashion.

06:36.909 --> 06:38.010
Give me back my phone.

06:38.010 --> 06:39.440
Gosh, come on.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.880
You have to let me\Nfinish the call.

07:36.930 --> 07:38.099
Crazy punk.

07:38.899 --> 07:41.969
That's not proper for\Na detective to say that.

07:41.969 --> 07:44.609
I was only saying\Nthat's how...

07:44.609 --> 07:46.380
such criminals get caught\Nin such places.

07:46.380 --> 07:47.539
What do you take me for?

07:48.310 --> 07:49.440

This is three dollars,

09:41.859 --> 09:44.389

12:57.989 --> 12:59.019
I appeared as a handsome\Npolice officer...

12:59.019 --> 13:00.060
in a commercial too.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.420
It's a long time ago.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.359
That's not the point,\Nyou know.

13:04.359 --> 13:05.389
I'm telling you...

13:06.629 --> 13:08.330
that you're cool\Nright now.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.869
Can you be\Nmore specific...

13:12.869 --> 13:14.300
in which part is\Nso cool about me?

13:15.639 --> 13:17.310
If a detective gives up,

13:17.810 --> 13:19.469
it means\Nthe whole world gave up.

13:20.080 --> 13:23.210
We're the last resort for\Nthose who are troubled.

13:27.119 --> 13:28.280
Forget it.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.650
Thinking back, there's\Nnothing so great about it.

13:31.719 --> 13:34.519
Anyway, I respect you\Na little.

13:37.430 --> 13:38.660
Take out "a little".

13:39.060 --> 13:41.599
What did you just say?

13:42.930 --> 13:45.969
I respect you,\NDetective Ha.

13:46.869 --> 13:47.969
Are you satisfied?

13:50.210 --> 13:51.369
At that time,

13:52.810 --> 13:55.540
if there had been\Na detective like you...

13:57.379 --> 13:59.780
This isn't right.

14:00.680 --> 14:01.849
It's a suicide.

14:01.849 --> 14:05.420
My parents wouldn't\Nkill themselves.

14:05.550 --> 14:08.519
They were murdered,\Nso please.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.290
Please find the culprit.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.999
It's 99.9 percent sure.

14:14.999 --> 14:17.269
It's not 100 percent!

14:17.430 --> 14:19.099
Goodness.

14:19.639 --> 14:23.509
It's not 100 percent.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.150
She's making me\Nuncomfortable now.

14:30.910 --> 14:33.320
I already told her\Nthat I'm a bad guy.

14:33.820 --> 14:35.979
So I've made up my mind.

14:36.550 --> 14:39.050
You've made up your mind?\NAbout what?

14:40.019 --> 14:41.820
Will you give me\Nback the ring?

14:41.820 --> 14:43.430
Give me the ring back.

14:43.790 --> 14:46.400
What are you\Ntalking about?

14:46.700 --> 14:47.900
The ring...

14:48.700 --> 14:50.469
Give me the ring back.

14:50.830 --> 14:51.999
The ring...

15:27.869 --> 15:28.999
The ring.

15:29.499 --> 15:31.339
The woman whom he\Ngave the ring to.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.210
Right. It was that woman.

15:40.150 --> 15:42.080
- It's 65 dollars.\N- Okay.

15:45.119 --> 15:47.489
What are you waiting for?\NPay it.

15:47.889 --> 15:48.989
Me?

15:49.660 --> 15:51.790
I thought you were buying.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.830
She said she respected me\Nand stuff a while ago.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.900
Forget it. I'll buy.

16:00.999 --> 16:04.609
He gladly bought that\Nexpensive ring for her,

16:04.609 --> 16:06.540
but he doesn't even\Nwant to buy me pork belly.

16:16.619 --> 16:18.450
She's really\Nstrange today.

16:18.450 --> 16:20.219
Detective Ha,

16:20.820 --> 16:22.259
you're cool.

16:35.099 --> 16:37.969
Gosh, she found out\Nthat I'm a cool person.

16:39.410 --> 16:42.580
I tried to hide it,\Nbut I couldn't help it.

16:44.780 --> 16:47.820
I wonder if she'll confess\Nher feelings...

16:47.820 --> 16:49.820
and make me\Nfeel uncomfortable.

16:50.889 --> 16:53.259
Why is she acting like\Nshe didn't take the ring?

16:54.019 --> 16:55.690
But it's awkward\Nto ask her directly.

16:56.359 --> 16:57.960
Did she eat it for real?

16:58.389 --> 16:59.930
Are you not done yet?

17:01.460 --> 17:03.070
I'm not your maid.

17:03.229 --> 17:04.400
You want me\Nto cook for you...

17:04.400 --> 17:05.530
when you're doing nothing.

17:05.530 --> 17:07.098
You told me not\Nto touch anything...

17:07.098 --> 17:08.769
when it comes to cooking.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.640
Set the table at least.

17:45.140 --> 17:46.479
So what did you make up\Nyour mind to do?

17:46.910 --> 17:48.309
You were saying\Nsomething earlier.

17:51.350 --> 17:52.549
I've decided...

17:53.380 --> 17:55.650
to go on the same path\Nas yours.

18:00.620 --> 18:01.620
Mine?

18:02.519 --> 18:04.190
I've failed before,

18:04.660 --> 18:06.900
so I think I can\Ndo better.

18:07.130 --> 18:08.999
Gosh. I knew\Nthat divorce...

18:09.400 --> 18:10.829
is not a big issue\Nthese days.

18:11.930 --> 18:13.299
I don't really care\Nmuch about it too.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.210
I'll try again.

18:23.779 --> 18:25.479
But it's too soon...

18:26.079 --> 18:27.979
to start again.

18:27.979 --> 18:29.650
I don't have much time.

18:30.090 --> 18:31.719
I get older every day.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.090
I'm not really ready.

18:34.090 --> 18:35.259
But for me,

18:35.719 --> 18:37.090
if I want to\Nstart again...

18:37.729 --> 18:39.059
I'd need many\Nnew things too.

18:39.059 --> 18:41.200
I have to think about it\Ncarefully.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.700
What is there for you\Nto prepare?

18:43.829 --> 18:45.700
I'll take care\Nof everything.

18:58.150 --> 19:00.620
I must have been\Na very cool man.

19:01.420 --> 19:02.719
She's so straightforward.

19:16.430 --> 19:17.729
The path you meant...

19:18.100 --> 19:19.400
was to study\Nin Noryang-dong?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.200
I've analyzed the reasons.

19:21.269 --> 19:22.700
They all passed\Nin Noryang-dong.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.069
How did Kyung Mi\Nget in then?

19:24.069 --> 19:25.840
She's the weird one.

19:26.509 --> 19:27.940
I know Noryang-dong\Nis nice,

19:27.940 --> 19:29.479
but what time is it now?

19:29.950 --> 19:31.079
It's 5am.

19:31.079 --> 19:32.350
There are no cars either.

19:32.350 --> 19:33.519
I know there are no cars.

19:35.950 --> 19:39.319
Are you asking me\Nto send you there?

19:39.789 --> 19:42.360
I know there are drunk\Nperverts out there,

19:42.360 --> 19:43.729
but I'm fine.

19:43.729 --> 19:45.590
I can run if I run across\Na pervert.

19:45.590 --> 19:47.059
I can run very fast.\NGoodness.

19:54.999 --> 19:56.809
You sure you're going to\NNoryang-dong to study?

19:56.809 --> 19:59.140
Why would I go there\Nif not to study?

19:59.140 --> 20:00.809
Half of the students there\Nare there to hang out.

20:00.809 --> 20:03.049
Some girls meet guys\Nas they study.

20:03.049 --> 20:04.549
There are many bars\Nand karaoke around there.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.479
Food is cheap there too.

20:07.450 --> 20:10.289
Oh, I can meet guys\Nthrough group studies?

20:10.489 --> 20:11.489
I didn't know that.

20:11.489 --> 20:14.860
Gosh. You're so ready\Nto date guys.

20:16.559 --> 20:19.029
Which guy would want to\Ndate an old woman like me?

20:19.489 --> 20:22.029
There are lecturers in\Ngeneral classes.

20:22.529 --> 20:23.600
What is this?

20:23.670 --> 20:25.870
Is he scared that...

20:25.870 --> 20:26.940
I'll date other guys?

20:27.469 --> 20:28.999
Why Noryang-dong\Nof all places?

20:28.999 --> 20:30.840
It's full of young\Nguys there.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.239
There are many classes\Nin Jongno...

20:33.239 --> 20:35.140
near that Tapgol Park.

20:38.049 --> 20:40.249
Gosh, this is bugging me.

20:48.819 --> 20:49.829
Thank you.

20:54.799 --> 20:56.900
Why would she want to\Nstudy when she is old?

20:57.499 --> 20:58.630
I told her\Nit's really tough,

20:58.630 --> 20:59.870
but she won't give up.

21:02.370 --> 21:03.870
I won't call her\Nwhen crimes occur...

21:04.440 --> 21:06.279
until she passes the exam.

21:26.229 --> 21:27.229
Gosh.

21:29.969 --> 21:31.930
Everyone's studying hard.

21:32.499 --> 21:33.769
I'll cheer up...

21:34.340 --> 21:35.539
and study hard too.

21:40.210 --> 21:43.009
It's good that\NI came early.

21:43.610 --> 21:45.249
I'll sit\Nin the very front.

21:45.249 --> 21:46.719
Hey, hey.

21:49.279 --> 21:50.450
Don't you see this?

21:51.819 --> 21:53.989
Goodness. What is this?

21:54.120 --> 21:56.829
You get into the class\Nbased on the orders here.

21:56.829 --> 21:57.989
If you want to get a seat,

21:57.989 --> 21:59.059
leave your notebook\Nin queue.

22:00.130 --> 22:01.660
Is this a queue?

22:03.200 --> 22:04.200
Yes.

22:11.539 --> 22:12.809
I've seen her somewhere.

22:15.509 --> 22:17.950
Where did I see her?

22:18.610 --> 22:19.680
Is she Yoo Seol Ok?

22:19.680 --> 22:21.549
Would it be correct to\Nconvict the defendant...

22:21.549 --> 22:23.350
if there's evidence?

22:23.819 --> 22:25.219
Convict the defendant\Nif there's evidence.

22:25.519 --> 22:26.819
Usually, people think\Nthe defendant should be...

22:26.819 --> 22:27.989
convicted if there's\Nevidence,

22:27.989 --> 22:30.460
but there are many cases\Nwhere they aren't.

22:30.759 --> 22:31.960
Do you know why?

22:32.289 --> 22:33.460
These are such cases.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.259
Say for instance there are\Nfive witnesses.

22:35.259 --> 22:37.370
When the jury hears the\Nwitnesses' stories,

22:37.370 --> 22:38.799
- it doesn't seem real.\N- Why is she blocking?

22:38.799 --> 22:39.799
She's blocking.

22:39.799 --> 22:42.200
Will the judge convict the\Ndefendant or not?

22:42.600 --> 22:44.009
The judge won't\Nconvict the defendant.

22:44.269 --> 22:46.210
The next step...

22:46.210 --> 22:47.739
is to convince the judge.

22:47.739 --> 22:49.749
Prosecutors have to insist\Nfor an investigation.

22:49.749 --> 22:51.610
The judge will then\Nselect the witness.

22:51.610 --> 22:52.749
Then this witness\Nin the court...

22:52.749 --> 22:54.579
Excuse me.\NYou're blocking.

22:56.289 --> 22:58.049
This is blocking me too.

22:59.190 --> 23:01.989
Evidence doesn't always\Nconvict the defendant.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.160
There has to be evidence.

23:03.160 --> 23:05.059
- The evidence has to...\N- Gosh.

23:05.059 --> 23:07.460
It's better to watch\Nthe video lectures.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.670
- There's evidence...\N- Goodness.

23:09.670 --> 23:10.799
The judge will convict\Nthe defendant if he...

23:10.799 --> 23:12.900
believes the evidence\Ngiven by the prosecutor.

23:12.900 --> 23:13.969
Aren't you going to work?

23:20.509 --> 23:21.579
You're working out.

23:32.420 --> 23:33.420
Are you tired?

23:35.519 --> 23:36.660
You're not tired, right?

23:37.190 --> 23:38.390
Gosh, it's so easy.

23:38.890 --> 23:40.100
It's so easy.

23:42.799 --> 23:44.130
I fell asleep here...

23:44.170 --> 23:46.029
when I worked out\Nhere before.

23:46.029 --> 23:47.539
But I can't sleep tonight.

23:55.410 --> 23:56.479
Sergeant Yuk.

23:57.150 --> 23:58.610
Stop taking advantage\Nof people who are new.

23:58.749 --> 24:00.049
You all have to work\Ntogether as a team.

24:00.380 --> 24:01.380
Don't you think?

24:03.989 --> 24:04.989
- I mean...\N- Gosh.

24:05.890 --> 24:08.019
Did I do something wrong?\NTell me.

24:08.989 --> 24:11.329
Stop showing off.

24:11.759 --> 24:13.400
You'll fail if you're\Nabove yourself.

24:15.329 --> 24:16.329
What did you say?

24:25.069 --> 24:26.170
You know Detective Go,\Ndon't you?

24:27.180 --> 24:28.380
The one that you killed.

24:28.809 --> 24:31.549
Go Jae Hyun.

24:40.690 --> 24:41.890
He was\Nmy senior detective.

24:54.499 --> 24:55.539
Are you crying?

24:56.340 --> 24:58.610
He's not someone who'd\Nlose in a fight.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.279
He must have\Nbugged him a lot.

25:02.509 --> 25:04.950
Why can't you have good\Nrelationships with your...

25:04.950 --> 25:06.180
- seniors and juniors?\N- Thank you.

25:09.019 --> 25:11.420
The one who's bugging\Nis Sergeant Yuk.

25:11.420 --> 25:13.489
Sergeant Yuk and Mr. Gye.\NYou know that.

25:14.059 --> 25:15.120
What do I know?

25:15.120 --> 25:16.729
I'm busy taking care\Nof the chief.

25:16.729 --> 25:18.289
My coins are stuck.

25:19.489 --> 25:20.660
This happens a lot.

25:21.430 --> 25:22.829
What's going on\Nbetween you two?

25:24.069 --> 25:25.529
He'd take all the credit.

25:25.529 --> 25:26.870
We're a team.

25:27.499 --> 25:28.700
I'm your team leader.

25:28.700 --> 25:30.039
They go everywhere\Nwithout me.

25:30.039 --> 25:31.640
- Yes.\N- What are you doing now?

25:31.640 --> 25:32.840
- What?\N- You all are...

25:32.840 --> 25:35.340
They don't even answer\Nto anything I ask.

25:35.340 --> 25:36.549
Have you checked\Nthe dash cam?

25:37.249 --> 25:38.249
Hey.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.079
Dash cam.

25:41.819 --> 25:43.690
I understand\NSergeant Yuk...

25:43.690 --> 25:45.549
because he has a spite\Nagainst me.

25:45.850 --> 25:47.120
Mr. Gye, that dog.

25:47.789 --> 25:48.960
He used to be\Nmy classmate.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.390
He can't do this to me.

25:51.489 --> 25:53.660
I heard that you looked\Ndown on Mr. Gye...

25:53.660 --> 25:55.829
when two you were\Nin the headquarters.

25:55.829 --> 25:56.870
Who said that?

26:01.640 --> 26:03.509
Crimes Unit One\Nis doing well.

26:04.170 --> 26:06.410
Mr. Gye is\Nan ambitious guy too.

26:07.140 --> 26:08.380
Your styles are different.

26:08.380 --> 26:10.579
But you all are\Non the same path.

26:10.579 --> 26:13.249
Detectives are here to\Ncatch criminals well.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.319
I know you're\NSeodong's Sniffer,

26:17.590 --> 26:20.090
but Sergeant Yuk\Nis Fighting Dog.

26:20.420 --> 26:22.390
His face is scary,

26:22.390 --> 26:24.460
but he's soft\Nat his heart.

26:25.059 --> 26:26.499
Stop showing off.

26:26.499 --> 26:27.960
And get along well\Nwith everyone.

26:29.130 --> 26:30.299
If they don't start,

26:30.569 --> 26:31.630
I won't fight with them.

26:37.769 --> 26:39.410
It is such a hectic...

26:39.410 --> 26:41.039
to listen to a lecture\Nfor four hours.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.110
I should've had\Nbreakfast...

26:43.150 --> 26:44.809
if I knew that it would\Ntake so long.

26:45.180 --> 26:46.549
What should I have?

26:49.279 --> 26:50.450
Goodness.

26:50.450 --> 26:52.489
They're eating\Nas they walk.

26:52.489 --> 26:55.590
That can save a lot time.

26:56.890 --> 26:59.059
I should have\Nsome food too.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.299
Pork belly.\NChicken mayonnaise.

27:03.529 --> 27:05.799
Pork belly, ham\Nflying fish roe.

Keep the manners, please.

Please don't sigh loudly.

28:07.930 --> 28:09.499
You're too noisy.\NPlease be quiet.

28:09.499 --> 28:11.100
Don't use\Na multi-purpose pen.

28:11.100 --> 28:12.969
Please let us study.

28:45.499 --> 28:46.600
I'm sorry.

29:01.249 --> 29:02.249
It's...

29:03.150 --> 29:04.890
worse than living\Nwith my in-laws.

29:33.049 --> 29:34.650
I cut you\Nenough slack already.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.150
I can't let it\Nslide anymore!

29:37.690 --> 29:40.219
How dare you glare at me?

29:40.289 --> 29:41.789
You rude punk!

30:03.279 --> 30:04.910
You know it's 4am, right?

30:06.049 --> 30:08.219
I said you don't have to\Ngive me a ride.

30:08.219 --> 30:10.049
I can run faster\Nthan perverts.

30:11.819 --> 30:13.160
Just go already.

30:14.759 --> 30:15.960
I might be late.

30:18.229 --> 30:20.029

30:44.390 --> 30:46.860
Don't turn back.\NIt's tempting you.

30:47.819 --> 30:50.160
I might fail again\Nif I stick my nose in.

30:50.259 --> 30:53.200
It's more important to\Ntake the front seat now.

31:21.989 --> 31:25.259
I might be late. Gosh.

31:27.329 --> 31:28.329
What?

31:28.799 --> 31:30.100
A murder case?

31:30.529 --> 31:31.930
I'll be right there.

31:52.489 --> 31:55.390
It smells like\Nfresh blood.

31:56.489 --> 31:59.289
It's a little fishy\Nand sweet.

31:59.759 --> 32:01.059
How should I describe it?

32:01.059 --> 32:03.329
It's cold and lacks iron.

32:04.499 --> 32:06.029
It's very high-tempered.

32:09.370 --> 32:10.670
It's just what I need.

32:12.039 --> 32:13.410
You're here already.

32:15.180 --> 32:17.110
There are so many CCTVs\Ninstalled in this area...

32:17.279 --> 32:19.279
except for this place.

32:19.279 --> 32:20.680
Is there nothing here?

32:30.989 --> 32:32.289
What are you doing?

32:32.900 --> 32:34.160
It's not him.

32:38.069 --> 32:39.400
Goodness.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.440
Go do it over there.

32:47.180 --> 32:48.509

I don't.

32:58.420 --> 32:59.989
Is my hair\Ntoo messy today?

33:00.460 --> 33:01.660
Do you still not\Nknow who I am?

33:01.789 --> 33:03.059
No.

33:05.390 --> 33:06.700
You don't know me?

33:07.160 --> 33:08.460
I was in an article...

33:08.460 --> 33:09.870
for being a genius\Nscientific investigator.

33:11.029 --> 33:12.499
I was also on a commercial\Nfor being...

33:12.499 --> 33:13.900
the handsome detective\Nof Seodong Station.

Stop it. I need to go\Nquestion the witnesses.

34:32.110 --> 34:33.518
It's strange.

34:35.978 --> 34:37.449
How tall are you?

34:38.420 --> 34:39.559
I'm 182cm tall.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.260
Why didn't tell me\Nthat first?

34:42.389 --> 34:43.590
Are you a fool?

34:43.789 --> 34:45.530
If you have eyes, look at\Nhow the body is down...

34:45.530 --> 34:47.030
and the victim's height.

34:47.030 --> 34:49.099
He isn't as tall as you.

34:56.670 --> 34:57.710
It's the same for me.

34:59.110 --> 35:00.210
of a normal detective\Nlike you...

35:00.210 --> 35:02.280

She's innocent because\Nshe didn't confess?

40:44.550 --> 40:46.090
Anyway, it's strange.

40:46.659 --> 40:47.659
Then again,

40:48.090 --> 40:50.159
she doesn't look like\Nshe'd kill someone.

You're no match for\Nthese young people.

43:29.990 --> 43:31.789
- Suddenly?\N- Yes.

43:32.990 --> 43:34.360
Something's fishy...

43:35.289 --> 43:36.690
since he told you that\Nhe'd come pick you up.

43:37.960 --> 43:39.429
This is to pick up\Nwomen for certain.

43:45.769 --> 43:48.570
This is the cheapest\Nmarket in Noryang-dong.

43:48.639 --> 43:50.309
Okay. Give me that.

43:53.979 --> 43:55.309
What is this for?

43:55.809 --> 43:57.309
If you wear this...

43:57.309 --> 43:59.650
and dry your hair,\Nyou can save time.

44:02.119 --> 44:04.420
These are to shut out\Ndistracting noises.

44:05.190 --> 44:07.920
This is to prevent\Nturtle neck syndrome.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.360
This is to check time...

44:10.360 --> 44:11.760
when I take mock tests.

44:11.760 --> 44:12.929
And this...

44:14.030 --> 44:16.900
is to stop making noises\Nwhen I put down a pen.

44:17.970 --> 44:19.940
You're spending a lot\Nof money to study.

44:21.900 --> 44:23.940
This town is scary.

44:25.240 --> 44:26.240
It says 500 times.

44:26.240 --> 44:27.639
(You have to recompense\N500 times the amount...)

44:27.639 --> 44:29.039
(if you get caught\Nshoplifting.)

44:33.780 --> 44:34.979
Why? Are you curious?

44:35.320 --> 44:36.320
You want to come in?

44:38.119 --> 44:39.519
No.

44:40.059 --> 44:42.019
I have some parts\Nleft to study today.

44:42.019 --> 44:44.659
Gosh, it's like a fox\Npassing by a henhouse.

44:45.789 --> 44:48.329
I guess you really don't\Nget along with this town.

44:48.329 --> 44:49.599
I'll pass the exam...

44:49.599 --> 44:51.970
and check crime scenes\Nwith authority.

44:57.940 --> 44:59.710
Let's see how long\Nthis will last.

45:26.769 --> 45:27.940
It's perfect.

45:36.139 --> 45:37.309
I need to talk to you\Nfor a minute.

45:37.309 --> 45:38.979
I'll be waiting\Non the rooftop.

45:39.110 --> 45:40.179
What?

45:40.479 --> 45:42.889
What on earth\Ndid I do this time?

45:45.920 --> 45:49.090
I threw away all my\Nnoisy multi-purpose pens.

45:49.090 --> 45:51.229
I put the noise\Npreventing mat too.

45:51.229 --> 45:52.760
I use a straw\Nto drink water too.

45:52.760 --> 45:54.199
So what did I do\Nwrong this time?

45:55.429 --> 45:57.130
Who's the manager?

46:01.170 --> 46:02.170
Ms. Yoo Seol Ok?

46:02.800 --> 46:04.139
Are you the manager?

46:04.139 --> 46:06.610
You're Yoo Seol Ok, right?

46:07.110 --> 46:09.409
Yes. Do you know me?

46:09.409 --> 46:11.909
Of course.\NI'm a huge fan of yours.

46:11.909 --> 46:14.249
The duct tape murder case.

46:14.249 --> 46:15.349
The No Du Gil case.

46:15.349 --> 46:17.090
And the marriage\Nfraud case too.

46:17.090 --> 46:18.820
Goodness.

46:19.090 --> 46:20.090
Oh, right.

46:20.619 --> 46:22.420
Drink this\Nbefore it gets cold.

46:22.420 --> 46:24.429
People will complain\Nif you drink this inside.

46:24.630 --> 46:26.030
Thank you.

46:26.300 --> 46:27.760
It's still warm.

46:27.760 --> 46:30.099
When I saw you\Nregister the study room,

46:30.099 --> 46:31.729
I was like,

46:31.729 --> 46:34.539
"Goodness,\Nis this for real?"

46:34.539 --> 46:36.809
All my body shook\Nout of excitement.

46:36.809 --> 46:38.240
I was too nervous\Nto talk to you.

46:38.769 --> 46:40.809
I plucked up\Nthe courage today.

46:40.809 --> 46:42.110
Really?

46:42.110 --> 46:44.849
I thought everyone\Nhated me.

46:44.849 --> 46:45.909
No way.

46:45.909 --> 46:48.019
I even joined\Nyour fan club.

46:49.150 --> 46:51.289
- I have a fan club?\N- Of course.

46:51.490 --> 46:54.090
It's called, "Yoo Seol Ok,\NI Will Arrest You."

46:57.159 --> 46:59.999
How many members\Nare there?

46:59.999 --> 47:01.059
There are two\Nincluding me.

47:01.059 --> 47:02.970
I'm not sure if the other\Nis a man or a woman.

47:02.970 --> 47:04.229
How about we have\Na meeting together...

47:04.229 --> 47:05.769
when it has five members?

47:05.900 --> 47:07.999
No, when it has\N10 members,

47:07.999 --> 47:09.440
let's do a fan meeting.

47:09.440 --> 47:10.670
I'll take the lead.

47:12.139 --> 47:14.110
By the way,

47:14.740 --> 47:16.110
I have a favor\Nto ask of you.

47:16.909 --> 47:18.150
Will you do it for me?

47:21.050 --> 47:22.150
But you said\Nyou don't usually...

47:22.150 --> 47:23.389
go through that alley.

47:24.119 --> 47:25.519
I had no choice\Nthat night...

47:25.519 --> 47:27.619
because it was too late.

47:28.559 --> 47:30.329
Otherwise, I had to\Ngo a long way round.

47:30.329 --> 47:32.630
Why didn't you report\Nto the police...

47:32.630 --> 47:34.300
when you saw\Nthe dead body?

47:34.829 --> 47:36.729
I didn't see anything.

47:37.599 --> 47:39.840
Your clothes\Nhad blood stains...

47:39.840 --> 47:42.369
of Lee Wang Sik who died.

47:42.840 --> 47:44.940
I thought the blood\Nwas from my nose.

47:46.139 --> 47:47.309
Yoon Mi Joo.

47:48.479 --> 47:49.780
Are you fooling around?

47:55.119 --> 47:56.990
The victim is a man.

47:57.420 --> 47:59.619
Could a woman stab...

47:59.889 --> 48:01.490
a man to death?

48:02.820 --> 48:05.190
He was an old man.\NIt could happen.

48:06.460 --> 48:08.829
It's the cheapest market\Nin this area.

48:08.829 --> 48:10.329
I hope they don't raise\Nthe prices...

48:10.329 --> 48:11.829
after changing the owner.

48:11.829 --> 48:14.400
What? A man is dead.

48:14.470 --> 48:16.039
That's something\Nnot important at all.

48:17.639 --> 48:20.179
This is sold at\N32 cents...

48:20.179 --> 48:21.840
in Ino Mart.

48:22.309 --> 48:25.110
32 cents? That's so cheap.

48:25.409 --> 48:27.519
It's a dollar in the\Nconvenience store.

48:27.820 --> 48:29.920
Ino Mart.

48:30.590 --> 48:32.690
Ino Mart.

48:34.659 --> 48:37.490
Can I take a break?

48:37.889 --> 48:39.530
I have an important\Nclass today.

48:39.530 --> 48:41.030
Yoon Mi Joo,\Nyou're arrested...

48:41.030 --> 48:42.559
as a murder suspect.

48:42.559 --> 48:43.599
A murder suspect?

48:44.300 --> 48:46.099
I don't have time\Nto do that.

48:47.300 --> 48:48.340
This year...

48:49.570 --> 48:51.170
is my last chance.

48:52.340 --> 48:54.179
Please give me my book\Nand notebook at least.

48:54.440 --> 48:56.139
I have an exam\Ncoming soon.

48:57.110 --> 48:58.510
Is that what's\Nimportant now?

48:59.110 --> 49:01.079
You might go to jail.

49:01.579 --> 49:04.019
I've prepared this\Nfor 3 years,

49:04.650 --> 49:06.389
studying 18 hours a day.

49:07.389 --> 49:10.159
I'd rather go to jail...

49:10.590 --> 49:12.030
than to go back to\NNoryang-dong if I fail it.

49:12.900 --> 49:14.559
Could you please\Nmeet Mi Joo?

49:14.559 --> 49:17.130
She's not a person\Nwho kills.

49:17.570 --> 49:19.300
She's a very sweet girl.

49:19.300 --> 49:21.440
Goodness.\NAll men are the same.

49:21.599 --> 49:24.409
I almost got killed\Nwhen I sat on her seat.

49:24.409 --> 49:26.880
She's nervous because\Nthe exam is coming.

49:26.940 --> 49:28.809
This is the last exam\Nfor her.

49:29.679 --> 49:31.780
Yoon Mi Joo has\Nmuch evidence.

49:33.280 --> 49:34.650
It's not her.

49:35.380 --> 49:37.289
You think you have\Nthe rights to say that?

49:37.550 --> 49:38.550
Sorry?

49:38.550 --> 49:40.360
There's only one person...

49:40.360 --> 49:41.519
who has\Nthe right to say that.

49:41.820 --> 49:43.059
Who is it?

49:44.329 --> 49:45.389
The culprit.

49:48.630 --> 49:50.429
Did you kill Lee Wang Sik?

49:50.599 --> 49:51.670
What are you saying?

49:51.670 --> 49:54.139
I was in my room all day.\NWhat are you saying?

49:54.139 --> 49:56.570
Then you have no right\Nto be sure...

49:56.570 --> 49:58.110
that Yoon Mi Joo\Nis not guilty.

50:00.979 --> 50:02.380
Thank you for the coffee.

50:31.909 --> 50:34.940
(You're going to be okay.\NLet's do it well!)

50:34.940 --> 50:37.179
Everything is optimized\Nfor the exam.

50:39.050 --> 50:40.780
There's no photo\Nof celebrity.

50:42.949 --> 50:45.519
The books have been\Nread for many times.

50:46.789 --> 50:48.289
There are only pens.

51:04.570 --> 51:05.670
Give that to me.

51:06.340 --> 51:07.539
Is it yours?

51:07.539 --> 51:08.979
I'll give it to her.

51:12.309 --> 51:14.179
Great. I'm sitting\Nin the front.

51:30.869 --> 51:32.570
I don't have a hunch\Nfor this case.

51:33.539 --> 51:34.740
Yoon Mi Joo\Nmust be the culprit...

51:34.740 --> 51:35.800
based on the evidence.

51:41.340 --> 51:42.880
What are you doing\Nduring working hours?

51:44.150 --> 51:46.050
You failed your\Npromotion test, right?

51:46.179 --> 51:47.979
I'm preparing for\Nnext year's.

51:48.150 --> 51:50.889
Gosh. Spend your time\Non catching criminals.

51:51.849 --> 51:54.420
You can say this because\Nyou're a single.

51:56.729 --> 51:59.030
When I think about\Nmy children,

51:59.389 --> 52:02.429
I feel like quitting my\Njob as a detective.

52:03.269 --> 52:05.699
My debts are increasing\Nas I investigate.

52:06.369 --> 52:08.300
So do that some\Nother time.

52:08.300 --> 52:10.010
Everyone's busy because\Nof the murder case.

52:10.010 --> 52:11.869
You can't work alone\Nin the office...

52:11.869 --> 52:13.909
just because\Nyou're a father.

52:14.380 --> 52:16.909
They should spare me since\NI have three children.

52:27.789 --> 52:28.960
- Hello.\N- Hello.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.990
You told me you'll buy me\Nan expensive meal.

52:32.429 --> 52:36.199
Our cafeteria is slightly\Nmore costly than others.

52:38.099 --> 52:40.170
- Sir, enjoy your meal.\N- Enjoy your meal.

52:43.070 --> 52:44.740
Look at your employees.\NThey're uneasy.

52:45.340 --> 52:47.010
You don't know\Nanything about them.

52:47.380 --> 52:50.179
My employees treat me\Nlike a family member.

52:50.249 --> 52:51.949
Look. Nobody\Nsits next to you.

52:52.380 --> 52:54.820
Gosh. You have no senses.

52:55.179 --> 52:57.119
You should have been\Na stubborn judge.

52:57.320 --> 52:58.389
No.

52:58.789 --> 53:01.090
I think it's\Nthe perfect job.

53:01.690 --> 53:02.990
There are so many parts\Nthat I can...

53:02.990 --> 53:04.289
contribute to our society.

53:04.760 --> 53:07.860
I'd also like to work\Nfurther on...

53:07.860 --> 53:09.670
Dongban network that\Nsupports the victims.

53:10.470 --> 53:12.229
Dongban was a great idea.

53:12.369 --> 53:14.499
Ye Na's family is stable\Nbecause of it.

53:14.869 --> 53:18.110
Wait and see. I'll work\Nmore on good projects.

53:22.510 --> 53:23.909
Speaking of which,

53:27.720 --> 53:28.749
why don't you...

53:29.420 --> 53:31.019
work for Ha and Jung\NLaw Firm?

53:34.260 --> 53:35.990
I have a lot to do\Nas a detective.

53:37.630 --> 53:40.099
Detectives have limits,\Nto be honest.

53:40.099 --> 53:41.960
But we have\Nmoney and power.

53:42.400 --> 53:44.199
We can help the victims...

53:44.199 --> 53:46.340
much more who suffer\Nfrom crimes.

53:46.940 --> 53:48.099
Let's work together.

53:52.909 --> 53:54.740
Dad isn't the same\Nas before.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.409
Wan Seung.

53:58.949 --> 54:00.179
I need you.

54:06.659 --> 54:08.590
(Investment Consultation)

54:08.590 --> 54:10.789
Sir, there's a guest.

54:14.130 --> 54:15.260
Have a seat.

54:19.530 --> 54:21.099
Chief Kang Bo Gook?

54:21.970 --> 54:23.539
I'm not a chief anymore.

54:23.740 --> 54:25.869
It has been long since\NI worked as a policeman.

54:27.179 --> 54:28.210
So?

54:28.210 --> 54:31.050
What brought you here,

54:31.449 --> 54:33.280
Inspector Woo?

54:33.449 --> 54:35.420
You know who I am.

54:35.820 --> 54:38.150
You pick up things fast\Nas I heard.

54:38.420 --> 54:40.059
That's not true.

54:40.059 --> 54:42.360
You're always on TV.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.329
Even my employee\Nrecognizes you.

54:45.329 --> 54:46.960
Could you give me\Nyour autograph?

54:51.869 --> 54:53.070
- Here.\N- Thank you.

54:56.070 --> 54:57.869
I'm here\Nto look for someone.

54:59.170 --> 55:00.539
You're at a real estate\Noffice, so you should...

55:00.539 --> 55:01.639
look for a house.

55:01.639 --> 55:02.979
I can't look for people.

55:04.050 --> 55:06.550
But who is it that\Nyou're looking for?

55:06.550 --> 55:08.619
He's someone whom\Nyou know very well.

55:10.690 --> 55:11.990
Detective Ha Wan Seung.

55:23.400 --> 55:24.970
You're working too hard.

55:25.170 --> 55:28.099
I have studied for only\Neight hours.

55:28.300 --> 55:29.369
What?

55:29.499 --> 55:31.309
Isn't eight hours a lot?

55:32.769 --> 55:35.409
There is this\N14-hour rule.

55:36.010 --> 55:38.610
You fail the exam if you\Nstudy less than 14 hours.

55:38.849 --> 55:41.619
Are you going to continue\Nstudying in Noryang-dong?

55:41.619 --> 55:42.820
Of course.

55:43.920 --> 55:46.389
I'll sit in the front\Ntomorrow.

55:47.490 --> 55:49.420
I'll be strong and\Npersistent from now on.

55:50.130 --> 55:52.860
You became weird after\Nstudying in Noryang-dong.

55:54.360 --> 55:55.360
I did?

55:55.360 --> 55:56.999
You're similar to them.

55:57.699 --> 56:00.340
Eating, walking,\Nand studying alone.

56:00.340 --> 56:02.440
I'm not sure if you're\Nwalking or being chased.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.070
You have earphones\Nin your ears.

56:04.070 --> 56:06.710
You wear sweat suits and\Nwear a big backpack.

56:06.909 --> 56:08.880
Homo-studypiens.

56:09.749 --> 56:13.050
What? Homo what?

56:13.050 --> 56:14.619
There are people\Nwho only exist...

56:15.019 --> 56:17.749
to study for exams\Nwithout any emotions.
