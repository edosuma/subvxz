Get out of me pocket,
you foul goblin.

20:09.018 --> 20:13.017
- But--but--but--but--
but--but--

20:13.018 --> 20:14.017
but, Santa,
you've got it all wrong.

20:14.018 --> 20:16.017
- On the contrary,
spongebob.

20:16.018 --> 20:18.017
You're the worst of all.

20:18.018 --> 20:20.017
- Aah!

20:20.018 --> 20:22.017
- Why, there you go right now,
wreaking havoc.

20:22.018 --> 20:27.017
- [Screaming]

20:27.018 --> 20:30.017
- Uh-oh.

20:30.018 --> 20:33.018
- I am ready
to destroy Christmas.

20:35.018 --> 20:37.017
Destroy Santa.

20:37.018 --> 20:40.017
- You want Santa,
you gotta get through me.

20:40.018 --> 20:43.017
- Okeydokey.

20:43.018 --> 20:44.017
- Oh, my.

20:44.018 --> 20:45.018
- Is that all you got?

20:47.018 --> 20:49.017
[Yelling]

20:49.018 --> 20:51.018
Aah!

20:54.018 --> 20:56.018
- I'm outta here.

20:59.018 --> 21:01.018
[Nails squeaking]

21:02.018 --> 21:05.017
You do realize
this counts as naughty?

21:05.018 --> 21:08.017
- You put that
jolly elf down,

21:08.018 --> 21:11.018
you big tin imposter.

21:15.018 --> 21:20.017
Hot from the oven,
full of lovin'.

21:20.018 --> 21:23.017
[Electronics crackling]

21:23.018 --> 21:26.017
Hurry up, Santa,
hop on.

21:26.018 --> 21:29.017
[Boom]

21:29.018 --> 21:32.017
- Thanks again
for saving my keister.

21:32.018 --> 21:33.017
- Oh, it was nothing.

21:33.018 --> 21:36.017
- You're clearly
a very good lad,

21:36.018 --> 21:39.017
unlike the owner of that
wind-up monstrosity.

21:39.018 --> 21:41.017
What have you got there?

21:41.018 --> 21:45.017
"If found, please return
to the chum bucket."

21:45.018 --> 21:47.017
Plankton!

21:47.018 --> 21:49.017
- Uh-oh.

21:49.018 --> 21:50.602
- Hand it over, Sheldon.

21:50.603 --> 21:55.017
Don't make it any worse.

21:55.018 --> 21:56.017
- Okay, boys.

21:56.018 --> 21:58.017
Let's give plankton
what he deserves.

21:58.018 --> 22:02.017
- Aah!

22:02.018 --> 22:04.017
- So long, kiddies.

22:04.018 --> 22:07.017
- Bye, Santa!
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

22:07.018 --> 22:09.017
- See you next year.

22:09.018 --> 22:10.017
- Hey, has anyone
seen Patrick?

22:10.018 --> 22:12.017
- [Giggling]

22:12.018 --> 22:14.018
Gotcha!

22:17.018 --> 22:20.017
- Santa's workshop?

22:20.018 --> 22:22.017
I'm here, Santa!
I'm here!

22:22.018 --> 22:24.017
- I'm not going in there.

22:24.018 --> 22:27.018
- Santa.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.017
There's only one thing
I wants for Christmas,

22:34.018 --> 22:37.017
and it's to meet me hero
spongebob squarepants.

22:37.018 --> 22:41.017
- [Laughing]

22:41.018 --> 22:44.017
- Argh?

22:44.018 --> 22:45.017
Ahh!

22:45.018 --> 22:47.017
- [Growling]
- Let go!

22:47.018 --> 22:48.017
No, no!

22:48.018 --> 22:50.017
- I think stealing
a mail truck

22:50.018 --> 22:53.017
definitely counts
as naughty.

22:53.018 --> 22:55.017
Wouldn't you say,
potty?

22:55.018 --> 22:57.017
- I sure would, Santa.

22:57.018 --> 22:59.017
[Laughter]

22:59.018 --> 23:01.618
Both: Merry Christmas.
