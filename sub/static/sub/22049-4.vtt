WEBVTT

00:03.020 --> 00:05.440
William likes girls who are model thin.

00:05.520 --> 00:11.060
If it's true that Williams dating someone,
I'm sure she's super skinny.

00:11.060 --> 00:12.040
Gum?

00:12.280 --> 00:16.100
<i>[Drama between Vilde and William.
Vilde is crying in the bathroom.]</i>

00:16.100 --> 00:18.100
What did you say to Vilde?

00:18.420 --> 00:21.140
She wanted to hook up with me,
but I wasn't interested.

00:24.620 --> 00:25.940
What's going on here?

00:26.060 --> 00:28.680
You like me.
-No I don't.

00:28.780 --> 00:30.680
Yes you do.
You like me.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.960
SKAM
Easter Special

00:55.020 --> 00:59.280
You said it was in Hemsedal!
I said it was just outside of it.

00:59.280 --> 01:03.420
According to Google Maps it's an hour
and a half away. That's not just outside of it.

01:03.540 --> 01:05.480
It's shorter from Oslo to Hemsedal.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.860
Are you kidding me? What are we going to
find here? It's in the middle of nowhere.

01:11.660 --> 01:12.920
Who is he?

01:44.960 --> 01:45.860
Hi.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.240
I've made the cabin ready for you.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.060
Eh, okay. Ready how?

02:00.260 --> 02:07.840
The only thing is that...
the electricity is a bit unstable.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.700
Just be careful.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.000
So you help grandmother with the cabin?

02:23.220 --> 02:23.960
Yes.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.120
Okay.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.520
Bye.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.240
My name is Kasper.

02:55.060 --> 02:56.160
Okay.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.160
What a creepy guy!

03:14.560 --> 03:19.320
It's good that he helps grandma with the cabin.
-But he's a bit weird.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.840
Just because people are different outside
of Ring 3... (= the road that can be seen as Oslo's border)

03:22.920 --> 03:25.100
... doesn't mean he's creepy.

03:44.960 --> 03:49.640
So he said: "Vilde, you are
really sweet, but I have to stop you."

03:49.640 --> 03:52.720
So I said: "Is it because you like someone else?"

03:52.720 --> 03:55.380
And he said: "It's because I'm not interested."

03:56.360 --> 04:01.280
I don't understand it. He's hot and
then he's cold. Then hot, then cold.

04:02.060 --> 04:07.740
We should've been in Hemsedal now.
So you could've gotten a rebound hook up.

04:07.820 --> 04:09.960
What's this?

04:10.140 --> 04:14.200
It looks similar to that Kasper who we met.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.960
Maybe Kasper's up for a rebound hook up.

04:16.960 --> 04:21.380
Maybe there's someone on Tinder.
-Nobody measures up to William anyway.

04:25.320 --> 04:31.320
All are like 20 kilometers away.
Maybe there's someone on Jodel?

04:36.520 --> 04:40.300
There's nothing on Jodel.
I'm not kidding.

04:40.480 --> 04:45.080
This is the first time I've experienced this.
-We've lost contact with the world.

04:45.080 --> 04:51.860
I wrote: "Hi! Can anyone hear us?
Is there no one out there?"

04:52.560 --> 04:54.980
I wonder what William
is thinking about now.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.760
Do we really have to talk
about guys the entire time?

05:00.940 --> 05:04.140
What else can we do?
There's nothing to do here.

05:05.120 --> 05:10.440
We're in a cabin! We have to play games,
or something.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.900
Are there no games here, Chris?

05:13.080 --> 05:15.200
TP? (Trivial Pursuit)
No, not TP.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.680
Do you actually have to
wear your hijab all the time?

05:35.200 --> 05:38.100
Why? Are you stressed out by it?

05:39.980 --> 05:44.360
No but, we're just with girls here.
You're not forced to wear it.

05:46.840 --> 05:52.140
Vilde, no one is forcing me to
wear it. I wear it because I want to.

05:52.140 --> 05:54.820
Okay, I have something better than a game.

05:55.060 --> 05:58.440
I have an Ouija board.
-What's that?

05:59.040 --> 06:05.020
It's fucking fun. You can ask spirits
questions and they'll answer you.

06:05.140 --> 06:10.200
For example, what is William thinking of now?

06:10.200 --> 06:12.200
Yes, we'll play!

06:13.000 --> 06:15.580
I'm going to lie down.
-Why?

06:17.000 --> 06:21.100
Are you superstitious, Sana?
Night, Vilde.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.140
Okay, let's play!

06:31.900 --> 06:37.740
Dear spirit who's here now,
does Jonas still have feelings for me?

06:47.880 --> 06:49.500
Nothing's happening.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.620
Are you doing this, Chris?
-I swear it's not me.

07:15.160 --> 07:19.420
Fuck. I knew it.
This really sucks.

07:19.820 --> 07:24.320
Why does it suck?
-We can't be friends if he still has feelings for me.

07:24.580 --> 07:26.900
You should have seen him at William's party.

07:26.900 --> 07:30.680
He was so jealous.
-Okay, but now it's my turn.

07:32.180 --> 07:37.100
Dear spirit, what's William thinking
of right now?

08:36.500 --> 08:39.280
Someone here? But who?

08:39.280 --> 08:42.440
No, now it's my turn Vilde.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.280
Can you ask who?
-Eh, no.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.280
Why not?

08:46.280 --> 08:52.240
Because I'm not curious what William's thinking
about. I want to know something else.

08:54.700 --> 09:02.020
Dear spirit, why didn't Sana want
to play with the Ouija board?

09:37.620 --> 09:41.480
Psychic.
-I knew it!

09:41.740 --> 09:44.020
I knew there was something
strange about her.

09:45.720 --> 09:49.500
For example, that she wears her
hijab all the time.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.940
What does that have to do with it?

09:53.220 --> 09:55.100
That's really mysterious.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.340
Your turn, Chris.

09:59.200 --> 10:03.520
Can you ask who William's thinking of?
-No, I'm not gonna ask about your man.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.900
I'm gonna ask about my man, okay?

10:07.100 --> 10:10.000
Spirit, let's talk about Isak.

10:11.020 --> 10:15.080
Why is he even together with Sara?

10:19.200 --> 10:20.800
<i>[Do you miss me?]</i>

11:00.180 --> 11:01.280
Hom?

11:17.740 --> 11:18.720
Gay?

11:20.600 --> 11:23.680
These spirits are smoking crack.
What's going on?

11:25.420 --> 11:31.320
Let's take a break now. -No, now it's my turn
and I want to ask who William's thinking of.

11:32.540 --> 11:38.660
We can just take a break.
-No! I've waited all round.

11:38.660 --> 11:41.600
We can take a break after
I've asked my question.

11:43.900 --> 11:47.640
I don't think the spirit is very serious if
it says Isak is gay.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.120
Eva!

12:06.660 --> 12:08.520
Okay, who's fucking around now?

12:09.180 --> 12:09.980
Huh?

12:11.700 --> 12:14.280
Is it you?
-No, what's up?

12:16.400 --> 12:19.440
Someone has replied on Jodel,
and it says:

12:19.940 --> 12:23.020
"Does Jonas still have feelings for me?"

12:25.020 --> 12:27.640
"What is William thinking of right now?"

12:29.980 --> 12:32.460
"Why is Sana not playing with the Ouija board?"

12:33.220 --> 12:34.640
Are you joking?

12:36.760 --> 12:40.660
2016..
Spirits are on Jodel.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.480
From "very close".

12:51.380 --> 12:54.980
Is it you?
-No, I promise!

12:57.780 --> 13:01.480
You had your phone just now.
You're the only one who could've done it.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.080
It wasn't me!
-Show your phone.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.120
Why should I show my phone?

13:06.360 --> 13:11.120
To see if it was you.
I'm telling you it wasn't me!

13:11.680 --> 13:13.700
Why are you so scared
to show your phone?

13:15.240 --> 13:17.880
What just happened?

13:22.200 --> 13:25.640
It was like a light went on for me.

13:26.740 --> 13:32.860
William is now a Russ.
And once someone's a Russ, they don't want a girlfriend.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.620
Everyone knows that.

13:34.840 --> 13:40.180
So even if he has a lot of feelings for me,
I can't fulfill them.

13:40.180 --> 13:45.940
Because he knows it's better to reject me now
than to hurt me during Russetiden.

13:46.540 --> 13:51.460
I'm not saying he has feelings for me,
but when the spirit said..

13:51.460 --> 13:55.660
he thought of someone here,
I thought it was noteworthy.

13:59.880 --> 14:04.200
Vilde, do you want bread?
-No, thanks.

14:05.380 --> 14:06.320
Why not?

14:07.440 --> 14:09.360
Because I'm allergic to gluten.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.160
You don't have a gluten allergy.

14:14.780 --> 14:18.280
Yes, I do. I have all the symptoms.
Which ones?

14:19.420 --> 14:23.500
Skin problems, hair loss,
acne, and itchiness.

14:23.740 --> 14:26.000
I'm tired and weak all the time.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It still doesn't work?

14:30.320 --> 14:34.380
I sent my grandma a message
asking for Kasper's number.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.780
Maybe it was Kasper who replied
to us on Jodel at night?

14:42.360 --> 14:46.640
What reply on Jodel?
-Someone on Jodel wrote everything we said.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.820
Is that him?

15:00.180 --> 15:01.260
What is it?

15:02.960 --> 15:04.420
A message from my grandma.

15:06.340 --> 15:09.940
"Kasper who? There's no guy helping
me with the cabin."

15:34.200 --> 15:39.540
Should I write "who are you" on Jodel?
-Yeah, do it.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.060
You're not going to get any answers.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.620
Sana?

16:00.300 --> 16:05.280
Can I ask you if you're psychic?

16:08.040 --> 16:09.720
Why would you ask that?

16:17.440 --> 16:21.820
I was just wondering.
-There's no bus before tomorrow.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.120
Are you kidding me?

16:24.660 --> 16:28.860
Hello people, can we relax a little?

16:29.340 --> 16:33.060
You don't seriously think Kasper
is out to get us?

16:39.020 --> 16:45.140
Say that's the case, what is he going to do?
There's five of us, he's by himself.

16:46.060 --> 16:47.600
And he's really small, too.

16:54.040 --> 16:58.960
We're stuck here anyway.
Let's at least have a good mood here.

17:00.280 --> 17:05.660
If you clean up a little here,
we can go and make some food.

17:07.360 --> 17:11.340
Vilde, are you coming?
Why?

17:12.640 --> 17:16.480
Because we're in a cabin.
Everyone has to help.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.980
Can you peel these and then slice them?

17:44.660 --> 17:49.100
What are we making?
-Tortilla.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.940
Do you need potatoes for tortilla?
-Yes.

18:01.300 --> 18:05.380
I'm actually not fond of potatoes.
-Why not?

18:09.200 --> 18:14.200
I just don't like them.
And they're really unhealthy.

18:18.100 --> 18:23.040
No Vilde, potatoes aren't unhealty.
Your body needs potatoes.

18:26.520 --> 18:29.160
Do you know what's so
good about potatoes?

18:33.060 --> 18:38.760
Potatoes have a lot of starch.
That's really good for you.

18:39.020 --> 18:44.780
Because you said you're tired
and weak all the time.

18:46.960 --> 18:51.520
And then there's Vitamin C.
-That's good for a cold.

18:54.240 --> 18:58.680
Vitamic C is like an antioxidant...

18:59.100 --> 19:02.400
To get rid of potentially dangerous chemicals.

19:05.420 --> 19:10.880
Those chemicals aren't good.
-It can actually cause cancer.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.460
And old skin, Vilde.

19:18.200 --> 19:23.240
Completely true. But vitamin C fixes that,
isn't that cool?

19:24.680 --> 19:25.960
Yeah.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.040
So then we'll have eggs.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.740
Eggs are full of protein.

19:33.880 --> 19:38.400
If you want to be strong
when you do sit ups...

19:38.840 --> 19:41.900
... and if you want to have abs,
you need protein.

19:43.560 --> 19:49.960
Eggs pretty much have
all eight amino acids...

19:49.960 --> 19:54.820
... you need them if you want to have a toned body.

20:00.360 --> 20:05.060
Did you know that eggs
increase your metabolism, too?

20:07.900 --> 20:08.840
No.

20:19.860 --> 20:22.560
How do you know so
much about food?

20:33.940 --> 20:38.000
Has anyone done a self defense course?
-Just cooking courses.

20:38.740 --> 20:42.380
I'm not going to be able to fall asleep.
-If we sleep tonight...

20:43.320 --> 20:48.060
So girls. Whatever happens,
we can't split up.

20:48.060 --> 20:51.280
That always happens in horror movies,
and then they die.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.940
I don't understand what he wants.
-He wants to have sex.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.880
That's the only thing men want.

20:57.440 --> 21:01.840
You want that too.
-Yes, but not with him here and now.

21:01.840 --> 21:06.580
We won't talk about guys now.
-Perhaps another time. But I don't have time for that.

21:06.840 --> 21:11.240
What should we do?
We just have to think a little.

21:11.240 --> 21:15.280
If your mom doesn't answer soon,
we have to call the police.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.460
She doesn't answer.
-The police can't do anything.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.980
Of course they can!

21:24.160 --> 21:28.280
There's a person stalking us.
That's what the police are for.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.260
Put your phone away.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.820
There's something I have to tell you.

21:53.380 --> 21:58.880
But you can't freak out.
-I can't be freaked out more than I already am.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.180
Vilde?
-Yeah?

22:05.060 --> 22:07.660
Remember when you asked me why
I never take off my hijab?

22:08.060 --> 22:08.800
Yes.

22:12.800 --> 22:17.480
The hijab makes sure...
I don't know how to explain this.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.260
But I wear it...

22:23.020 --> 22:25.080
... so I can see things no one
else can see.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.020
Are you psychic?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.220
Call it what you want.

22:43.340 --> 22:45.180
But ever since we got here...

22:46.420 --> 22:47.660
I've seen images...

22:50.180 --> 22:51.440
Of Kasper...

22:57.300 --> 22:58.980
What kind of images?

23:02.800 --> 23:06.840
Images from another time.
-Fucking hell.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.740
Are you kidding me?

23:15.820 --> 23:17.900
I see him right now.

23:29.660 --> 23:31.640
He's standing behind that door.

23:35.460 --> 23:38.140
Fucking hell.
I'll going to start crying.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.700
What does he want?

23:46.220 --> 23:47.620
He wants to be seen.

23:52.160 --> 23:57.400
He says we have to see people like him.
-People who are a little different.

24:01.220 --> 24:05.000
That was really sick.
Look, I'm shaking.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.040
I can't do this without you.

24:19.220 --> 24:20.600
You have to be with me.

24:25.440 --> 24:26.780
Be with you for what?

24:31.360 --> 24:36.280
We have to see him.
That's the only way we can make him disappear.

24:50.940 --> 24:52.600
You don't have to be scared.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.520
I'll go in front.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.360
My hijab will protect us.

25:18.540 --> 25:19.680
Are you guys ready?

26:01.580 --> 26:02.740
He's standing back there!

26:04.300 --> 26:07.060
Fucking hell!
-Are you kidding me?

26:08.240 --> 26:09.360
Oh my god!

26:10.380 --> 26:11.220
Fuck!

26:11.220 --> 26:12.740
That's badly done.

26:21.620 --> 26:25.020
I hate you! Fuck!

26:25.040 --> 26:26.220
Dont cry.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.160
I'm not crying!

26:28.160 --> 26:30.160
Yes you are!

26:30.860 --> 26:32.720
"I'm shaking. I'm shaking."

26:33.700 --> 26:35.660
What about you?

26:36.280 --> 26:39.420
You went: "We have to accept death."

26:39.420 --> 26:44.220
You should've seen your face when Sana
said she was psychic because of her hijab.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.160
It wasn't that weird that
I believed it.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.360
You know that it's just an ordinary scarf?

26:54.980 --> 26:56.860
But then what's the deal with Kasper?

26:56.980 --> 27:02.200
Kasper's just a guy from the electrician
who helps my grandma with the cabin.

27:02.580 --> 27:06.980
Are you joking? -Why do you think he was outside
when the power came on?

27:08.480 --> 27:11.820
Fucking hell, oh my god.
-Everything was bullshit?

27:12.060 --> 27:17.380
Yeah! Sana told me it was her who fucked
with us on Jodel yesterday.

27:17.420 --> 27:19.280
Was that you?
-Yeah!

27:20.620 --> 27:24.600
We decided to continue fucking with you,
because it was so much fun!

27:26.660 --> 27:28.300
It worked good as hell!

27:30.400 --> 27:35.800
You're really sick!
You can't do this to people!

27:36.000 --> 27:37.680
Don't take it so seriously.

27:38.020 --> 27:42.720
But what about the Ouija board?
-Was it real that William was thinking of me?

27:44.600 --> 27:49.560
Vilde, it also said Sana was psychic
and Isak was gay.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.440
So don't take it seriously.

27:53.280 --> 27:53.460
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

27:53.460 --> 27:56.840
But it also said Jonas still has feelings for me.
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

27:56.840 --> 27:58.840
And I know that's true!
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

27:58.840 --> 27:59.440
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

27:59.440 --> 28:01.660
So it's not completely false.
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

28:01.660 --> 28:02.120
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

28:02.120 --> 28:04.540
And the Ouija board didn't directly say Isak's gay.
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

28:04.540 --> 28:04.620
And the Ouija board didn't directly say Isak's gay.

28:04.620 --> 28:06.060
<i>[Sick that he got with a 97'er.]</i>
And the Ouija board didn't directly say Isak's gay.

28:06.060 --> 28:09.680
<i>[Sick that he got with a 97'er.]</i>

28:09.680 --> 28:09.940
<i>[You should try it.]</i>

28:09.940 --> 28:11.180
Fucking hell!
<i>[You should try it.]</i>

28:11.180 --> 28:12.260
Are you still in shock?
<i>[You should try it.]</i>

28:12.260 --> 28:16.480
Best female actress goes to... Sana!
<i>[You should try it.]</i>

28:16.480 --> 28:17.520
<i>[You should try it.]</i>
