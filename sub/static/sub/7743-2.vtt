WEBVTT

00:09.093 --> 00:10.843
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:12.388 --> 00:13.805
l don't fucking sleep, Kevin!

00:13.889 --> 00:15.264
l don't keep secrets, Jackie.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.933
What message are we sending Fi?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.893
"l'm sorry,
you're just not quite as important as Grace.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.770
"We have money for her tuition,
but not yours."

00:20.854 --> 00:21.854
lt's tuition, Kevin!

00:21.980 --> 00:24.148
l suddenly am in the middle of something
terribly private

00:24.233 --> 00:25.608
between Jackie and her husband.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.528
And l would prefer
that we didn't work the same shifts.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.321
l gotta put my marriage back together.

00:30.406 --> 00:34.200
The fucked-up thing is, l want to do it
for Kevin as much as l do for you.

00:36.328 --> 00:37.704
Your husband is here to see you.

00:37.830 --> 00:41.332
Low blow, Zoey. No, come on,
it's not like anyone married you either.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.668
Jackie is married, you stupid fucking goat.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.420
She is? Wait, you are?

00:45.587 --> 00:48.256
-You slept with her.
-Yes, l did, my friend.

00:49.717 --> 00:50.675
Lenny and l had sex.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.176
-No.
-What?

00:52.553 --> 00:53.761
l just laid out two grand

00:53.846 --> 00:55.513
for Fiona's tuition.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.057
l'm paying every penny.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.751
"...night but the night before
24 robbers came knocking at my door

02:06.835 --> 02:10.755
"They stole my watch, they stole my ring
and then they all began to sing

02:10.839 --> 02:14.342
"Policeman, policeman, do your duty
One, two, three, four, five

02:14.802 --> 02:18.679
"Not last night but the night before
24 robbers came knocking at my door

02:18.764 --> 02:22.725
"They stole my watch, they stole my ring
and then they all began to sing

02:22.851 --> 02:26.187
"Policeman, policeman, do your duty
One, two, three, four, five"

02:26.271 --> 02:27.688
Awesome.

02:27.898 --> 02:31.025
-Fi, honey.
-Honestly, we couldn't be more pleased.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.777
Neither could we.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.612
My uniform itches.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.948
-Yeah, mine, too.
-Try not to scratch, peanut.

02:37.032 --> 02:40.326
-What about you, Miss Grace? ltchy?
-l'm used to it.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.788
Well, l must say,
Fiona's classmates are very excited.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.499
And you, young lady, get to be the new girl.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.042
That's quite an honor.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.753
Dad already checked.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.588
We're good.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.798
Shall we?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.396
Come on.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.916
l see. Yes. You're wearing shoes.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.005
Come in.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.386
Come in!

03:47.936 --> 03:50.438
-l have a complaint.
-l have many.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.528
Mine's mean-spirited.
Makes me feel small-hearted.

03:57.613 --> 04:00.281
-ls it justified?
-l can't tell.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.868
Maternity keeps stealing
all the good gloves from the ER.

04:03.952 --> 04:07.330
Steal them back. Hide them. Hoard them.
Show some initiative.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.248
-Two wrongs don't make a...
-Wanna bet?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.877
What if l get caught?
Will you have my back?

04:12.961 --> 04:16.464
-Don't get caught.
-But if l do and l'm interrogated,

04:17.382 --> 04:18.674
they'll know l'm hiding something.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.509
Your head's not made of glass,
Miss Barkow.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.136
No one can see what you're thinking.

04:27.851 --> 04:28.851
So, you can't tell...

04:28.936 --> 04:31.479
Actually, l can. You're looking right at it.

04:31.647 --> 04:32.813
Rats.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.110
May l?

04:39.613 --> 04:40.655
Be my guest.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.662
Okay, here we go.

04:56.338 --> 05:00.091
"Cinderella dressed in yellow
Went downtown to meet her fella

05:00.175 --> 05:03.427
"On her way she kissed a snake
How many doctors did it take?"

05:03.512 --> 05:08.182
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 1 0...

05:19.194 --> 05:20.361
Look out!

05:29.538 --> 05:32.832
Looks like you've broken your wrist.
Can you call up to X-ray?

05:32.916 --> 05:35.835
You blindsided me. She blindsided me.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.130
Yes, well, that's what happens
when you get in her way.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.383
You guys got this covered.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.312
-Everything all right between you two?
-With O'Hara? Please.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.232
-Same shit, different doctor.
-Right on.

05:58.608 --> 06:02.111
One more thing. Mind your own business.

06:02.779 --> 06:07.533
-Dude, can we please bury the hatchet?
-Yeah, let's bury it in your head.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.091
What, no rabbit?

06:26.887 --> 06:28.554
No rainbow scarves? No doves?

06:30.057 --> 06:33.267
-lt's called initiative.
-Or petty theft.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.728
A second ago,
you thought it was magic, so...

06:35.812 --> 06:39.648
-This is true.
-Jackie, l got the topical from pedes.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.359
Coming.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.324
Watch my catheter in three.
l'm gonna raid oncology.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.951
Just for the record,
those people have cancer.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.661
l do not approve.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.080
Please don't be a buzzkill.

07:00.629 --> 07:01.670
What's up?

07:01.838 --> 07:05.341
Did you like that? "Topical from pedes"?

07:06.093 --> 07:09.512
Took me, like, 20 minutes. l got a lot of gifts.
Lying's not one of them.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.640
-l don't know about that.
-Yeah, well, it's true.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.684
Eddie.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.942
Kev showing up at work?

07:23.318 --> 07:25.736
l thought he was here to try
to bash my brains out.

07:25.821 --> 07:28.072
-Well, he wasn't.
-l'm lugging this shit around

07:28.156 --> 07:30.324
like a bag of rocks and it's killing me.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.369
And then he calls and asks if l play softball.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.538
Do l want to be on the bar team?

07:35.789 --> 07:40.501
Fuck, Jackie. lt's too complicated.
lt's not what l do.

07:40.585 --> 07:45.131
-Then say no, Eddie. Just tell him no.
-And then what? Just drop out of his life?

07:46.049 --> 07:48.843
l'm the guy he calls when his wife
leaves him on the side of the road.

07:49.511 --> 07:53.013
l never would have gotten involved
if l knew you were married.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.266
l don't know what you want me to do.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.601
l want him to know that l work at All Saints.

07:58.937 --> 08:02.189
-You are out of your mind.
-No. See, l'm not.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.525
Everything he knows about me is a lie.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.820
Give me one little shred
of integrity here, please,

08:07.904 --> 08:10.865
so l don't have to keep making up bullshit
about who l am.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.034
This lies on top of lies crap...

08:15.537 --> 08:17.621
Maybe you can live like that, l can't.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.415
And l'm not trying to blame you.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.750
l stayed in when l should've gotten out.

08:22.085 --> 08:25.004
Now l'm looking for a solution
that works for everyone.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.174
Well, that doesn't work for me, so...

08:30.844 --> 08:33.345
When you get down to the molecular level
of shit,

08:34.055 --> 08:36.557
the simplest solution is the right one.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.851
We need to simplify.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.563
You knew you were married. l didn't.

08:42.647 --> 08:46.150
l think you owe me a little help
getting out of this.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.277
And don't take this
the wrong way, sweetheart,

08:48.361 --> 08:51.572
but you are an amazing fucking liar,

08:52.407 --> 08:54.742
a world-class genius.

08:57.078 --> 09:01.081
So just think about it.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.793
l don't need to think about it.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.507
Call him and tell him you just
lost yourjob and you're looking for work

09:10.592 --> 09:12.426
in a downtown pharmacy.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.347
-And then what?
-l'll take it from there.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.694
l got the purple ones.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.576
Put half in my desk.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.245
-Half?
-Half.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.794
Patient's totally agitated.
Tried to start a Valium drip,

09:46.878 --> 09:49.171
she won't let me come near her. Coop either.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.258
Also, don't make me work with him.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.592
Grow up.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.055
TB?

09:59.224 --> 10:00.349
Chicken pox.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.851
Scared to death. Scars.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.728
Where'd you get the good gloves?

10:05.021 --> 10:06.355
Hey, guys.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.650
Good luck getting her to talk.
She won't tell me how it happened.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.861
How you doing? Not so good, l guess.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.947
l need stitches.
Well, you've come to the right place.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.033
l cut my thumb down to the bone,
one of my knuckles, too.

10:18.493 --> 10:22.121
-And l don't want him to touch me.
-He's a very good doctor.

10:22.205 --> 10:25.708
l know, but can't he go be a doctor to
someone else?

10:27.752 --> 10:30.337
-Him, too.
-He's only a nurse.

10:30.672 --> 10:31.672
Douche.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.093
l just can't be around anyone
who pees standing up.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.471
l really can't. Would it kill them to aim?

10:39.806 --> 10:43.309
No men, no boys.
Just for today, please. l swear to God.

10:44.019 --> 10:47.521
Tell you what.
O'Hara is working a poison ingestion.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.023
Maybe she'll swap.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.278
What the hell.
A little poison never killed anyone.

10:54.529 --> 10:55.696
Let's do it.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.704
Thank you forjoining us, Dr. Cooper.

11:05.123 --> 11:08.417
Where was l? Michelle Obama.

11:08.710 --> 11:14.465
Does anyone know what gets
Michelle Obama out of bed in the morning?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.801
Anyone?

11:19.512 --> 11:20.637
Fat kids,

11:21.556 --> 11:25.017
traveling the country, schools, hospitals,

11:25.101 --> 11:28.645
educating the country
about childhood obesity.

11:29.147 --> 11:32.024
She was supposed to visit St. Vincent's,
God rest its soul,

11:32.108 --> 11:36.195
it's no longer with us.
So, New York was taken out of the tour.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.655
But as of this morning, we're back in play.

11:38.740 --> 11:39.740
Doughnut?

11:39.824 --> 11:42.534
lt's between All Saints and Bellevue.

11:42.619 --> 11:46.288
And l don't need to tell you what l think
of Bellevue. Well, maybe l do.

11:46.998 --> 11:51.794
Two words, Lily Chung.
Networking monster.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.340
She went on safari with Melinda Gates.
She's my counterpart

11:56.508 --> 12:00.511
and she does not, l repeat,
does not need the cachet

12:00.595 --> 12:03.555
that a visit like this would bring. We do.

12:03.640 --> 12:09.770
Do you have any idea what that kind
of press will do for our profile?

12:09.938 --> 12:16.735
CNN, MSNBC, People magazine.
l'm talking People, people.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.196
-You can't put a price on it.
-Please stop being mad at me, bro.

12:19.280 --> 12:26.078
-Pay attention, man.
-So, please join me in making fat kids

12:26.371 --> 12:28.789
enemy number one at All Saints.

12:29.791 --> 12:33.168
Well, you know what l mean. Just do it.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.213
Wow, you were not kidding.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.424
This is all the way down to the bone.

12:38.508 --> 12:42.010
Stop scratching.
lt's this chicken pox times four.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.387
They've been out of school all week.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.222
The Valium should be kicking in any minute.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.391
-l did it with a hacksaw.
-Yikes.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.143
Well, it's not like l had a choice.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.812
lt's four boys, and a husband
who can't change a light bulb.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.357
l bought a new toilet seat,
went to unscrew the bolts on the old one.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.360
lt's totally fused together with urine
because who aims?

12:58.445 --> 13:01.822
Nobody. They just pull out their wieners
and let 'er rip.

13:02.073 --> 13:04.450
All of 'em. l tried pliers, wouldn't budge.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.828
-So, you know...
-Yeah, hacksaw. l got it.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.663
When was your last tetanus shot?

13:09.789 --> 13:12.749
Eighth grade. l mean, how hard could it be?

13:12.834 --> 13:15.919
lt's not like it's Skee-Ball.
lt's a tiny little hole 1 0 feet away.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.839
lt's a big fucking punchbowl
right in front of your zipper! Jesus.

13:19.340 --> 13:22.843
l'm mopping up pee every single day.
lt's disgusting.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.554
Me, too. Bedpans and catheters. l got you.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.264
Yeah, but you get paid.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.851
-Yes, l do.
-You know how l get paid? ln urine.

13:31.019 --> 13:34.521
Okay, you guys, why don't you go wait
outside? l'll be out there in one minute.

13:34.606 --> 13:35.606
Okay?

13:38.526 --> 13:42.446
Hello. Oh, crikey. Hello. You must be Mamie.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.282
l'm glad you're here.
Mamie, this is Dr. O'Hara.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.202
Yeah, there's the Valium.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.124
-Right.
-lf you don't mind, the boys are outside.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.167
l'm just gonna deal with them.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.543
Yeah, l think that would be best.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.681
-Okay, guys, follow me.
-Bag!

14:15.230 --> 14:18.690
-This is Thor. He's my boss.
-Hilarious.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.527
-Hey, guys.
-Take them to the family room,

14:21.611 --> 14:23.195
fill them up with snacks,
stick them in front of the TV.

14:23.279 --> 14:27.449
Don't you dare. Snacks and TV are why
our kids are in danger.

14:28.409 --> 14:31.828
Their motherjust unhinged herjaw
and tried to devour them.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.039
TV is the safest place. Trust me.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.917
Stand up straight.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.713
Gentlemen.

14:45.260 --> 14:48.762
80-ish male, arrested Tompkins Square.
Witness called it in.

14:48.846 --> 14:52.099
Defibbed in the field.
Pulse is weak and tachy.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.976
Probably wandered off from the V.A.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.687
On my count. One, two, three.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.731
Mr. Graham, can you hear me?

15:07.782 --> 15:08.782
He's DNR.

15:08.950 --> 15:09.950
Come again?

15:11.953 --> 15:15.038
Hey, Mr. Graham. l'm Dr. Cooper.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.416
Can you tell me what happened?
Do you remember what happened?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.252
Guys, he's "do not resuscitate."
What the fuck were you thinking?

15:20.336 --> 15:22.879
Someone calls 91 1 ,
we're obligated to resuscitate.

15:22.964 --> 15:26.466
-That's ridiculous.
-Pre-hospital setting. Law's on his side.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.636
For fuck's sake.
Break a rule once in your life.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.098
All right.

15:35.476 --> 15:38.562
l wanted to die outside.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.051
l don't know what to say.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.305
-You have to give him his own space.
-l'm not trying to get into his space.

16:13.389 --> 16:16.808
l'm trying to drag him into my space,
and he's being a dick.

16:16.893 --> 16:20.604
Maybe you have to bare your soul.
To him, not me.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.690
Him. Him.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.818
Jackie.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.237
Yes, of course l'll hold.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.281
What do you think l've been doing
for the last 40 minutes?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.159
Just got an email from Sloan-Kettering.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.703
O'Hara's putting out feelers around town.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.915
That's a good hospital.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.292
No, l do not want to leave a message.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.879
-That's all.
-Yeah, okay. Thanks.

16:52.595 --> 16:56.390
Urology. Score.
Can l hide them in the cot room?

16:56.474 --> 16:57.891
Do your thing.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.942
-Yeah, not a drive-thru.
-Two-by-twos.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.845
Two-by-twos. Secret stash. Knuckle bump.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.769
Her hands were kind of full, so...

17:47.900 --> 17:50.277
You are very kind.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.658
Feeling better?

17:58.035 --> 18:00.787
l can't believe l went off like that
in front of the kids.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.831
They seem pretty resilient.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.459
l look at the other moms.

18:05.835 --> 18:12.299
Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Xanax, Ativan.
l think, "l don't know.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.886
"Maybe it would help." But l just...

18:17.680 --> 18:20.182
l don't want to be that kind of mom,
you know?

18:22.185 --> 18:23.435
Wow. l do.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.647
Why don't l go get your boys?

18:40.495 --> 18:43.997
All l'm saying is,
Deklin said that Jackie went off.

18:44.499 --> 18:48.001
l know you guys share a rig, but l was there.

18:49.128 --> 18:53.840
The guy was DNR. Jackie was right.
And she didn't go off.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.887
Someone calls 91 1 ,
we have to resuscitate, boo.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.681
He wanted to die outside.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.812
Then be mad at the guy that called it in.
Don't be mad at me.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.026
That's how it is?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.278
Yeah. That's how it is.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.697
You done for the day?

19:18.199 --> 19:19.783
Just lunch.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.870
lf you ever want company, l'm totes avail.
Totally available.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.247
Just saying.

19:26.207 --> 19:30.043
Got it. And thank you.

19:31.379 --> 19:32.838
You look nice today.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.009
What? You seem kind of over me.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.344
l'm not.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.105
l know. l'm sorry, Kev.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.983
The last thing l meant to do was scare you.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.527
Sweetie, l'm not a moron.

19:56.988 --> 20:00.240
Yes, of course there's
a potential for addiction. Yes.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.450
But l was nowhere near that.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.452
Honey, l'm not that kind of mom.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.674
Honey, listen. l just got called into trauma.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.759
Okay? l'm gonna run. l love you so much.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.803
Yeah, we'll talk later. Okay, bye.

20:28.895 --> 20:34.649
A-K-A-L-l-T, as in Tom, U-S, as in Sam.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.360
But that doesn't mean l want to
leave a message, because l don't.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.070
l need 40 minutes. l'll be right back.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.614
l'll give you 20.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.616
No, l'm not gonna spell my name again.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.868
And l think it's high time
that you spelled yours.

21:08.351 --> 21:11.853
Monday equals lunch on the terrace.
Do l know you or do l know you?

21:14.023 --> 21:15.815
Sloan-Kettering? Really?

21:16.651 --> 21:21.071
l trained with Brenda.
Columbia Pres., l know everybody in HR.

21:21.155 --> 21:23.907
St. Luke's,
l trained more than half their staff.

21:24.742 --> 21:28.620
So, there is pretty much no place
you can go where l can't be in 24 hours,

21:28.704 --> 21:30.163
just so you know.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.582
l'm not that easy to get rid of.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.962
-May l bring you...
-Hold your horses.

21:42.760 --> 21:46.137
lf l ever needed a friend, it's now.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.598
lf you want to jump ship,
you're gonna jump ship

21:48.683 --> 21:49.849
and there's nothing l can do about it.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.560
But don't think for one second

21:52.687 --> 21:56.982
that l won't cash in my chips at All Saints,
'cause l will. And l will find you.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.653
Because you are my friend.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.866
That's just the way it is.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.328
So you might as well stay.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.124
Please stay.

22:15.918 --> 22:16.918
That's all l got.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.640
-Did l miss anything?
-l wouldn't know.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.058
l hit the 3 o'clock at NYU.

22:33.728 --> 22:36.604
-One day at a time, my friend.
-Hanging in by a thread.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.565
l'm gonna do it this time. l really am.

23:04.508 --> 23:08.970
"Dear Sam.
l am sorry l slept with your girlfriend.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.849
"What a dick move. Seriously.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.144
"Apologies are a two-way street.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.355
"And seeing that we work together,
and even though

23:19.440 --> 23:22.108
"l am a doctor and you are a nurse,

23:22.860 --> 23:27.280
"l still want to apologize to you
and for you to accept my apology

23:27.406 --> 23:31.367
"as much as l accept yours.
Don't forget, you broke my nose.

23:32.203 --> 23:36.456
"l forgive you. Yours truly, Dr. Fitch..."

23:36.540 --> 23:37.791
Damn it!

23:40.795 --> 23:41.836
Excuse me.

23:45.299 --> 23:47.217
l think he was a gardener.

23:49.970 --> 23:54.015
-Lenny says the EMTs feel bad.
-Good. Should have left him alone.

23:54.475 --> 23:57.811
People got to stop trying to save people
who don't want to be saved.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.145
End of story.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.483
-Do we have a time of death?
-Hey, no flowers in the bays.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.944
Shut up.

24:11.492 --> 24:14.953
-l think that's it.
-Do you... ls it okay if l...

24:15.037 --> 24:16.454
Yeah.

24:29.844 --> 24:30.844
He's gone.

24:44.692 --> 24:49.863
No shortage of cold shoulders
between Kevin and Grace and you.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.366
What if we were to have lunch tomorrow?

24:56.745 --> 24:58.371
Not quite there yet.

24:58.789 --> 25:01.541
But we're getting closer. l can tell.

25:02.293 --> 25:05.253
How about the day after tomorrow?
l'm buying.

25:06.213 --> 25:09.424
-Not making any promises.
-Look who you're talking to.

25:14.597 --> 25:16.556
My new class is almost all girls.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.809
That's because there's more girls
on the planet than boys.

25:19.894 --> 25:22.312
Nobody has to worry.
There's plenty of boys, okay?

25:25.941 --> 25:28.276
What you got there, Jackie?
Having a Shirley Temple?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.612
Yeah. l'm trying to take it easy.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.948
Besides, l am still hungover
from your first wedding.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.118
Hey, how you doing, Eddie? Long time.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.829
Yeah, seems like forever. How's it going?

25:39.997 --> 25:43.958
Shit, that was an awesome wedding.
Not like this jackass.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.502
Who the fuck has a cash bar at a wedding?

25:46.587 --> 25:49.047
Lay off. Jackie and Kevin had a cash bar.

25:49.131 --> 25:51.090
You, my friend, are full of crap.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.426
Kevin, we didn't have a cash bar
at our wedding, did we?

25:53.594 --> 25:55.678
How can you not remember
something about your wedding?

25:55.763 --> 25:58.848
Of course l remember.
But l think l have to buy a round

25:58.933 --> 26:01.142
of drinks for being such a chintzy bride.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.854
Kev, you'd better take that money
and run, pal.

26:04.939 --> 26:09.776
Yeah, l'd like to see you try.
You could go to the ends of the Earth.

26:10.152 --> 26:13.446
And wherever you go,
24 hours later, l'm gonna be there.

26:13.614 --> 26:17.951
Cash in my chips, grab the girls,
do it so fast it'd make your head spin.

26:19.453 --> 26:20.954
That's just the way it is.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.209
You are stuck with me.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.797
Quick favor. Follow me.

26:34.551 --> 26:38.846
So here's the deal. Eddie lost his job today.

26:38.931 --> 26:43.351
-Wow. l'm sorry to hear that.
-Yeah, well, that's the least of it.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.520
He's looking for a pharmacy gig.

26:45.604 --> 26:49.399
Thought maybe you'd put in a word
at All Saints.

26:49.483 --> 26:53.987
-Yeah, sure. l'll see what l can do.
-Yeah, see what you can do.
