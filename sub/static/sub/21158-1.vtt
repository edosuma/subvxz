[Alba] <i>In 1928, women were essentially</i>
<i>seen as accessories to be shown off...</i>

00:18.640 --> 00:21.160
<i>objects unable to express an opinion</i>
<i>or make a decision.</i>

00:22.120 --> 00:26.680
<i>Life wasn't easy for anyone,</i>
<i>but it was even harder for women.</i>

00:29.120 --> 00:31.760
<i>If you were a woman in 1928,</i>

00:31.840 --> 00:35.000
<i>freedom seemed impossible to achieve.</i>

00:35.080 --> 00:40.920
<i>To society,</i>
<i>we were just housewives and mothers.</i>

00:41.880 --> 00:44.840
<i>We didn't have the right</i>
<i>to have dreams or ambitions.</i>

00:46.480 --> 00:49.760
<i>To seek a future,</i>
<i>many women had to travel far and wide...</i>

00:51.880 --> 00:53.600
You're not going anywhere!

00:53.680 --> 00:57.480
<i>...and others had to confront the norms</i>
<i>of a backward, chauvinist society.</i>

00:57.560 --> 00:59.920
-Leave her alone!
-You stay out of this!

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Stay out of this!

01:02.120 --> 01:06.560
<i>In the end, all of us, rich or poor,</i>
<i>wanted the same thing:</i>

01:06.640 --> 01:08.160
<i>to be free.</i>

01:08.240 --> 01:10.960
<i>And if, to be free,</i>
<i>we had to break the law,</i>

01:11.040 --> 01:13.720
<i>we were willing to do it,</i>
<i>regardless of the consequences.</i>

01:21.640 --> 01:25.040
<i>Only those who fight for their dreams</i>
<i>can achieve them.</i>

01:45.760 --> 01:47.600

-Quickly!

01:49.440 --> 01:51.320

-[Pedro] You thought you'd get away?
-[Gimena gasps]

01:59.920 --> 02:02.800
Don't you dare move.
This is between Gimena and me.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.640
-She never wants to see you again.
-Let her tell me that.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.800
If you shout, I swear I'll kill you.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.039
Calm down, I'm begging you.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.600
[Pedro] I will when you tell your friend
you're coming with me.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.520
-She's not going with you.
-She'll do as I say!

02:16.600 --> 02:18.920
Otherwise, first I'll kill her, then you.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.920
Fine, I'll do whatever you want,

02:54.000 --> 02:55.360
[softly] Look at me.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.720
[Alba] You shouldn't have been here.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.480
I shouldn't have brought you.
I'm sorry.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.520
-Shh... It was our dream.
-It <i>is</i> our dream.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.920

Priors for theft and fraud...

03:59.080 --> 04:00.640

As of today,
many of the company's services

Candidates for switchboard operators,
line up on the left and state your names.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.160
Welcome to the Telephone Company.
Can I help you?

06:23.240 --> 06:25.840
-Yes, I'm here for the tests.
-For switchboard operator.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.480
Tell me your name. I'll check the list.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.040
-Lidia.
-Lidia?

-Lidia Aguilar.

I'm sorry, you're not on the short list.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.840
-Short list? I thought we just came--
-You're not the only one.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.320
They were inundated with applications,
so they made a short list.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.760
-I'm sorry, Lidia. Thanks for coming.
-Oh, well.

06:46.840 --> 06:47.960
Your name is?

06:49.600 --> 06:50.720

08:37.280 --> 08:39.240
I'm here for the operator tests.

08:39.320 --> 08:43.440
Someone said they were here,
but I don't see anybody!

08:44.000 --> 08:47.240

All right. Ricardo Rodríguez?

09:23.360 --> 09:24.960
[both yelp]

09:26.960 --> 09:29.400
They shut the door. We've been left out.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.360
The tests started at 12:00.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.080
I got lost three times in the subway.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.920
[Ángeles] No, you can't...

09:37.640 --> 09:38.640
Yes?

09:38.720 --> 09:41.440
Excuse me, we're here
for the switchboard operator tests.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.080
-You're late.
-I know.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.800
I know punctuality comes first
in this company.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.480
Then why did you knock?

09:49.800 --> 09:52.600
To find out if understanding comes second.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.440
Look at her.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.440
Straight from the station
with her suitcase.

10:01.520 --> 10:04.360
-Six hundred kilometers to get here.
-Five hundred and fifty.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.320
Yeah.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.320
And because she was one minute late,
she'll go home empty-handed.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.160
It's my fault... Miss Millán.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.800
[stammers] I'm sorry.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.280
I offered to accompany them
since I was bringing you these papers,

10:23.840 --> 10:25.640
and I got the floors mixed up.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.560
-You got the floors mixed up?
-Yes.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.640
Your first mistake
since you started working for me.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.280
As you see,
our workers are very understanding.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.760
But, unfortunately for you,

10:34.840 --> 10:37.080
Ángeles doesn't decide
if you get through this door.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.240
I do.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.840
-Thank you.
-Yes, thank you.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.080
If I went back to the village
without doing the tests--

10:52.160 --> 10:53.760
-Ángeles, isn't it?
-Mm-hmm.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.840
With a name like that,
you must be our guardian angel.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.560
I wouldn't say that. [chuckles]

11:00.760 --> 11:02.200
Sorry. Over here.

11:03.920 --> 11:04.800
Excuse me.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.640
Would there be a way to pass the tests
without taking them?

11:09.720 --> 11:10.560
No.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.400
Are you all here for the tests?

11:24.680 --> 11:26.640
It's going to be very hard to choose.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.320

13:28.640 --> 13:29.840
[inhales deeply]

13:30.760 --> 13:32.840
Miss Aguilar, which academy did you go to?

13:32.920 --> 13:34.720
-None. I'm self-taught.
-Self-taught?

13:34.800 --> 13:36.480
-Yes.
-[chuckles]

13:36.560 --> 13:38.800
Haven't you ever studied anything
on your own?

13:38.880 --> 13:41.080
To be honest, I've never studied.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.960
But don't tell my father.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.440
I wouldn't want him to think
he wasted his money on my boarding school.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.840
I imagine that,
after doing well on the tests,

13:54.920 --> 13:56.960
you don't know why you weren't chosen.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.360
It's your arms.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.840
-What?
-They're not long enough.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.560
There are many subscribers,
the switchboards are big,

14:04.640 --> 14:07.360
and sometimes an operator has
to handle two switchboards.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.480
If I may say...

14:11.240 --> 14:14.040
You're two centimeters under the minimum.

14:15.280 --> 14:19.760
If I may be so bold, Don Carlos,
this requirement is nonsense.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.800
-Excuse me?
-Trinidad Seijo,

14:22.880 --> 14:24.920
the operator in my hometown,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.840
did the whole county,
almost 300 subscribers,

14:27.920 --> 14:29.120
all with one hand.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.360
She only had one hand.

14:32.880 --> 14:35.520
So it's not the length, it's the skill.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.160
Why do you want to be an operator?

14:41.240 --> 14:44.760
You want me to say
it's the greatest job in the world.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.080
But we both know I'd be lying.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.720
Your job is much better.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.400
But, unfortunately,
I'm told it isn't available.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.120
A woman with character,
the gift of the gab and a sense of humor.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.880
Not the first one you've met, I'm sure.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.600
I've met a few...

15:02.720 --> 15:04.200
but I don't know if any were like you.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.320
No, they weren't.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.640
Carolina, see the lady downstairs.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.360
Tell Sara she's on the list.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.400
-Welcome aboard, Miss Aguilar.
-Thank you.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.720
The next time
you want to impress a manager,

15:20.800 --> 15:22.520
don't tell him you want to take his job.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.080
And the next time
you want to impress a woman,

15:25.160 --> 15:28.560
don't make her feel you're only interested
in her measurements.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.600
The wouldn't-hurt-a-fly act worked.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.640
Excuse me? I don't know what you mean.

15:38.720 --> 15:43.480
The goody-two-shoes act may work
on Sara and Carlos, but not on me.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.760
I'll be watching you.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.480
Honey, you'd better take the stairs.

15:57.560 --> 15:58.760
[chuckles softly]

16:02.800 --> 16:04.880
-[lines ringing]
-[indistinct chatter]

16:05.800 --> 16:08.680
[Ángeles] Good afternoon.
Operator three. How may I help you?

16:10.280 --> 16:11.560
One moment, please.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.480
Central here. You have a call from 235.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.840
Do you wish to take it?

16:25.560 --> 16:26.720
Thank you.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.200
[Sara] Thanks, Ángeles.
That's enough for now.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.240
Ángeles knows the company
and her job better than anyone else.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.920
[Alba] <i>The operator who knows this company</i>
<i>and her job better than anyone else.</i>

16:36.640 --> 16:41.320
<i>If anyone could tell me</i>
<i>all I needed to know to rob the safe,</i>

16:41.400 --> 16:42.360
<i>it was Ángeles.</i>

16:42.440 --> 16:44.320
There are three shifts:
morning, day, and night.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.920
<i>I'd have to get close to her</i>
<i>and get her to trust me enough</i>

16:48.000 --> 16:51.320
<i>to tell me the secrets</i>
<i>of the Telephone Company.</i>

16:51.800 --> 16:55.120
[Sara] When you hear the gong, it's time
to change positions, is that clear?

16:55.840 --> 16:58.640
Good. Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:58.720 --> 17:00.720
the company director
wants to introduce himself.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.680
Don Francisco, the new employees.

17:04.760 --> 17:05.880
Marta Rodríguez...

17:05.960 --> 17:10.599
-Isn't Carlos Cifuentes the director?
-He's the owner's son.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.000
-[Sara] María Inmaculada Suárez.
-Who's the director?

17:13.920 --> 17:14.960
[Sara] Laura Sarmiento.

17:16.640 --> 17:17.720
Petra Silva.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.040
Lourdes Trapero.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.880
This is Raquel Levante.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.680
Remedios Fuentes.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.160
Carlota Rodríguez de Senillosa.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.920
Lidia Aguilar.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.480
Alba.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.920
I'm sorry, but you've mistaken me
for someone else.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.200
My name's Lidia Aguilar.
Pleased to meet you.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.200
I'm sorry, Miss Aguilar.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.160
You reminded me of an old friend.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.360
Don't worry.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.280
[Sara] María José Pando.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.960
[young Francisco] <i>Come on, Alba!</i>

17:59.040 --> 18:00.240
Run!

18:00.320 --> 18:02.320
Pass me the suitcase!

18:02.400 --> 18:03.440
TEN YEARS EARLIER

18:03.520 --> 18:05.160
[young Alba] <i>I can't believe</i>
<i>we're going to Madrid.</i>

18:05.760 --> 18:07.760
-Do you regret it?
-Are you crazy?

18:07.840 --> 18:08.840
[Francisco chuckles]

18:08.920 --> 18:11.760
I'm thinking of all
I'll do when I get there,

18:11.840 --> 18:12.960
like finding a job.

18:13.040 --> 18:17.320
Then I'll save a lot of money.
I'll buy a beautiful dress

18:17.400 --> 18:19.720
and go to an open-air dance
and order a White Lady.

18:19.800 --> 18:23.520
-A White Lady?
-Of course. It's what city girls drink.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.240
[chuckles]

18:25.320 --> 18:27.120
-What are you going to do?
-Me?

18:27.200 --> 18:30.120
I'm going to kiss that lovely birthmark
on your neck.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.040
[train whistle sounding]

18:43.560 --> 18:45.560
Hey! My suitcase! Hey!

18:53.880 --> 18:56.400
-Hey! Hey, you thief! That's my suitcase!
-No, it's mine!

18:56.480 --> 18:57.480
Listen, I...

18:59.040 --> 19:01.320
Let go of me! Francisco!

19:01.400 --> 19:03.520
<i>Francisco!</i>

19:15.320 --> 19:17.040
[phone ringing]

19:19.280 --> 19:22.480
-I told you not to call me here.
-[Alba] <i>It's an emergency, Beltrán.</i>

19:22.560 --> 19:24.400
A problem's come up.

19:24.480 --> 19:28.920
I can't do the heist I planned.
I need another place... and more time.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.080
Don't give me your life story.

19:31.160 --> 19:34.640
You know the penalty for murder? Death.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.720
<i>You have one day to avoid it.</i>

19:37.640 --> 19:39.560
<i>Tomorrow at 1:00, in the park.</i>

19:41.560 --> 19:44.840
Carlota, do you know how to get here?

19:45.800 --> 19:48.360
Dolores' Boardinghouse on Blancaró.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.280
Yes, you can't miss it.

19:50.360 --> 19:53.640
Go straight ahead,
take the third street on the left--

19:53.720 --> 19:56.640
-[Miguel] It's the <i>second</i> on the left.
-Says who?

19:56.720 --> 20:00.720
Miguel Pascual, communications engineer.

20:01.240 --> 20:04.040
Madrid born and bred.
I know the city blindfolded.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.280
[laughs] Did you hear, Marga?
A versatile man.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.760
Not many of those around.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.600
-I agree.
-[gasps]

20:11.600 --> 20:12.640
[chuckles]

20:12.720 --> 20:15.720
-This is Miguel.
-[stammers] Oh, he's your boyfriend.

20:15.800 --> 20:19.040
Don't say that word in front of her.
She's allergic to it.

20:19.120 --> 20:22.400
[chuckles] I'm going to the bar
across the street later. You coming?

20:22.480 --> 20:23.920
I'll finish up and see you there.

20:25.720 --> 20:29.720
Lidia, are you coming to the bar with us?

20:29.800 --> 20:31.840
No, I've got things to do.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.120
[Marga] Can I come?

20:33.200 --> 20:35.760
It's to thank Ángeles
for what she did for us.

20:36.560 --> 20:37.680
Ángeles is going?

20:37.760 --> 20:41.600
Yes, she left her daughter
with a neighbor. Are you coming?

20:41.680 --> 20:42.720
[Ángeles] Good evening.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.800
The Cifuentes family made
a huge investment

20:46.880 --> 20:48.800
in erecting this building.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.080
Naturally, they want to increase security.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.280
We only have access during our shift.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.200
They have to be careful.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.880
Everything goes through head office.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.720
Company earnings, payroll...
Basically everything.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.760
[Marga] Grandma,
you're going to make me deaf!

21:02.840 --> 21:05.400
See? You're worth your weight in gold.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.160
<i>Just wait till I tell Rosario...</i>

21:07.240 --> 21:10.360
Grandma, before you say anything...

21:11.760 --> 21:14.000
I've been thinking about it and...

21:15.000 --> 21:17.720
I should turn down the job
and go back to the village.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.080
What? Are you crazy?

21:21.240 --> 21:22.920
We're not a rich family,

21:23.000 --> 21:24.760
and you haven't got a husband
to support you.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.520
<i>I won't let you stay here</i>
<i>for the rest of your life</i>

21:27.600 --> 21:29.800
<i>looking after an old lady.</i>

21:29.880 --> 21:33.360
<i>You gave up enough for your mother.</i>
<i>God rest her soul.</i>

21:33.440 --> 21:34.920
Sure, Grandma...

21:35.960 --> 21:38.680
but I was happy with you and my mother.

21:38.760 --> 21:42.440
She was with you, too.
But you have to look out for yourself now.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.040
<i>For once in your life,</i>
<i>think just about yourself,</i>

21:45.120 --> 21:46.160
<i>not everyone else.</i>

21:46.240 --> 21:48.720
I know. And I am, but...

21:50.800 --> 21:54.680
-the capital's too big for me.
-Fear passes, Marga.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.440
And so does life
if you don't make the most of it.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.720
<i>-Don't forget that.</i>
-Thanks.

22:02.280 --> 22:05.520
I have to go, Grandma.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.400
Take care. [kisses] I love you.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.160
[sighs]

22:13.800 --> 22:15.440
-That's a lot of money.
-[Carlota] Hey...

22:15.520 --> 22:17.960
Stop talking shop, and let's have a toast.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.120
Vermouth.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.440
But vermouth has alcohol in it.

22:21.520 --> 22:25.120
[laughs] Yes, but you can order
something else if you like.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.480
No, that's okay.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.920
Maybe it's too strong for me, too.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.320
I haven't had one since...
I can't remember.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.800
I haven't been in a bar
since I got pregnant.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.520
It'll prepare you for the champagne
at the party tonight.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.600
[Marga] What party?

22:40.680 --> 22:43.760
-[Carlota] The grand opening party.
-[Ángeles] Everyone's going.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.640
I can't go. I need to watch my daughter.

22:45.720 --> 22:49.480
But the operators are going,
the clerks, even the bosses...

22:49.560 --> 22:51.560
The Cifuenteses are mingling
with the workers. Sure.

22:51.640 --> 22:54.720
-It's about time!
-I can't go.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.480
I don't like parties much.

22:56.560 --> 22:59.680
[scoffs] To say you don't like parties,

22:59.760 --> 23:02.280
you have to have gone
to at least one in your life.

23:02.360 --> 23:05.160
[laughs] And you look
like you've never been to any!

23:05.240 --> 23:08.120
Come on, let's toast. Come on, Lidia.

23:08.200 --> 23:12.040
Let's toast to Marga
and her first vermouth.

23:12.120 --> 23:16.080
To Ángeles, because she helped us
get this opportunity.

23:16.160 --> 23:19.080
-And to the new cable girls.
-[Ángeles] Yes!

23:22.040 --> 23:25.480
Ah! And because
we're now independent women.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.720
[man] Carlota.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.840
Get your things
and come with me right now.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.920
No. I don't have to go anywhere.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.120
I have a job
and I'm an independent woman.

23:41.560 --> 23:43.480
Let go of me.
I'm not one of your soldiers!

23:43.560 --> 23:44.640
Let go of me!

23:45.280 --> 23:46.840
-[Miguel] Don Emilio--
-Stay out of it.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.480
You're nothing to this family.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.120
You'll have to force me.

23:50.200 --> 23:55.000
[Emilio] You thought I wouldn't find out?
When did you become a liar?

23:55.080 --> 23:57.360
[Carlota] Since you stopped caring
about what I want.

23:57.440 --> 24:00.320
I don't want a husband.
I want a job and to be independent.

24:00.400 --> 24:05.120
A girl of your class doesn't work.
Stop this nonsense and get in the car.

24:06.760 --> 24:07.840
I said get in!

24:08.480 --> 24:09.680
[all gasp]

24:12.400 --> 24:14.080
Yes, sir, Colonel.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.320
[stuttering] So that's...

24:22.400 --> 24:23.760
Carlota's father, yes.

24:26.800 --> 24:30.720
Well, I'd better go home.
My husband's waiting for me.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.760
-Can you find the boardinghouse?
-Yes.

24:32.840 --> 24:35.720
Carlota told me how to get
from here to Blancaró Street.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.320
-Good. See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.840
Ángeles! Wait, I'll go with you.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.640
Let the champagne flow
and get whatever the gentlemen need!

24:49.360 --> 24:51.840
I assume you're here because you did it.

24:51.920 --> 24:55.520
I got the job,
and I know where the safe is.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.560
But there's a problem. I saw Francisco.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.360
-[Victoria] Francisco?
-[Alba] <i>My</i> Francisco.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.640
-[Victoria] What?
-He's the company director.

25:01.720 --> 25:03.360
-[Victoria] Did he see you?
-Yes.

25:03.440 --> 25:06.120
[Victoria] You have to get out of there
right away.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.480
[Alba] I can't. If I don't pay what I owe,
I'll be convicted.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.160
[Victoria] If I had that money...

25:14.240 --> 25:15.960
You know me.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.200
Victoria, I'm doing it tonight.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.960
One of the girls said
that there's security, but I can do it.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.400
I'll go to the party, get the keys,
take the money,

25:26.480 --> 25:28.680
and tomorrow I'll be far away from here.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.000
And from Francisco.

25:32.280 --> 25:36.200
-Alba, I think--
-I just have to be quick.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.200
If I see him, I'll give him the slip.

25:40.280 --> 25:43.680
Alba, rushing things is never wise.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.040
It's crazy.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.360
It's either that or the garrote.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.040
Ah!

25:53.840 --> 25:55.160
Room 27.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.280
Come here.

25:58.440 --> 26:02.960
Alba, honey, I've already lost Gimena.
I wouldn't want to lose you, too.

26:24.120 --> 26:27.320
Dinner is at 8:30,
and the door is locked at 11:00.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.680
I know I needn't worry
about your behavior.

26:29.760 --> 26:32.720
Your grandmother assured me
that you're a responsible girl.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.480
This is a decent boardinghouse,
and now it's your home.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.560
Come.

26:41.360 --> 26:45.200
Here. There are sheets on the bed,

26:45.280 --> 26:49.240
and there's a set of towels
you can use until you buy your own.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.360
-Good night.
-Doña Lola...

26:51.440 --> 26:56.720
tonight is the company's opening party.
They've invited the new operators.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.960
I promise I'll be back
before you lock the door.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.040
Very well. Be careful.

27:01.120 --> 27:05.600
There's always some swine waiting
to take advantage of a decent girl.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.600
You know, "open mind, closed legs."

27:08.680 --> 27:10.320

-What, honey?

I'm just saying what everyone thinks.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.240
-Wonderful!
-We'll pay off the house.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.520
You'll stop working.
Our problems are over.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.480
You understand? You understand, honey?

I love you. Let's celebrate.

I'm so happy!

Yes.

27:52.120 --> 27:56.200
-Mario, you want me to stop working?
-That's what we talked about.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.280
Well, yeah.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.080
Yes, we did, but...

28:02.880 --> 28:05.440
that was before, and...

28:06.320 --> 28:08.160
Mario, I love my job.

28:10.360 --> 28:13.520
More than being at home
with your husband and daughter?

28:13.600 --> 28:17.720
No, you two are my priority. Always.

28:17.800 --> 28:21.960
If we're your priority, what are you doing
drinking vermouth while we're at home?

28:22.040 --> 28:24.520
God, it was the first time in three years.

So I see. You were having
a terrible time until I arrived.

Ah! I haven't had time.
And one must be nice to the staff.

Is that what you're doing?
Being nice?

others you do for pleasure.

you're expected on stage.

[Carlos] Stay there, miss.
You owe me a dance.

[Ricardo] I want to thank all of you
who have come here tonight

to join with us in celebrating the opening
of Europe's largest telephone exchange.

You all know that this hasn't been
an easy road, nor a short one.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.560
And that all these gray hairs
are due to that road.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.800
But we're finally here.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.920
And we wouldn't be
if it weren't for the person

33:04.000 --> 33:06.800
who was the driving force
behind this project.

33:06.880 --> 33:09.880
He's loyal, hardworking and honest.

33:09.960 --> 33:11.800
And it gives me great peace of mind

33:11.880 --> 33:15.840
to leave this company's future
in my son-in-law's hands,

Ten years ago, I couldn't have imagined
being here today.

with the love of my life.

Today, I have almost everything
I dreamt of.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.840
Almost, because one could always want
something more.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.400
Today is the beginning
of a new era for the company,

33:54.480 --> 33:56.240
one that will span the oceans.

its first intercontinental call.

and cry and complain.

enjoy it, laugh, and move forward.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.080
to not give my family what they deserve?

43:03.160 --> 43:06.160
I promised you everything,
that you'd live like a queen.

43:06.240 --> 43:10.600
And what did I get?
You're here all day, taking calls.

43:14.760 --> 43:18.680
You've convinced yourself
that it's right, and it's not.

43:21.360 --> 43:22.800
Let me make you happy.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.320
Please.

43:28.440 --> 43:30.040
Let's be the family we dreamt of being.

43:42.280 --> 43:43.320
STAFF FILE

43:43.400 --> 43:45.400
[door opens and closes]

43:46.600 --> 43:47.440
[Carlos] Good morning.

43:57.360 --> 44:00.640
-What are you looking for?
-The keys to the safe.

44:00.720 --> 44:04.120
Either I left them behind here,
or I lost them wherever I was last night.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.000
You should try drinking
two fewer glasses of brandy.

44:07.080 --> 44:10.440
-It'd be good for your memory.
-But terrible for my soul.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.480
My soul is free. It can't be chained.

44:13.480 --> 44:14.760
Right.

44:14.840 --> 44:16.960
You should try smiling sometime.

44:18.920 --> 44:19.960
Are you all right?

44:22.520 --> 44:24.920
-Do you remember Alba?
-Alba?

44:26.240 --> 44:27.560
[chuckles]

44:28.800 --> 44:30.560
[sighs]

44:30.640 --> 44:36.200
The love of your youth who vanished
without a word? Who ran away from you?

44:36.280 --> 44:37.880
Her? No.

44:38.880 --> 44:39.920
Yesterday, I thought I saw her.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.720
-Again?
-There was a strong resemblance.

44:42.320 --> 44:44.440
Francisco, people change in ten years.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.000
A lot. Look at you.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.680
[chuckles]

44:49.760 --> 44:52.760
Yes, you're right.
Forget it. It was stupid.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.560
Besides, there's things to be done.

44:57.080 --> 45:00.680
Elegant enough to be immortalized
next to His Majesty?

45:01.320 --> 45:04.480
Without those bags under your eyes,
I'd say you look quite respectable.

45:06.040 --> 45:08.040
There's a lot to do.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.960
-[stomps foot]
-What's on the agenda?

45:10.040 --> 45:13.760
First, inform Sara
about who's making the call.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.160
I've taken care of that already.

45:16.360 --> 45:17.520
Personally.

45:23.560 --> 45:25.840
-So?
-I'm sorry I'm late.

45:25.920 --> 45:28.320
-Changed your mind?
-What's going on?

45:28.400 --> 45:31.080
They're announcing which operator
will make the call.

45:31.160 --> 45:34.080
They'll give it to Ángeles.
She has the most experience.

45:34.160 --> 45:37.400
Ladies, we won't draw this out.

45:37.480 --> 45:40.920
Today, the transoceanic call
will be made between the king

45:41.000 --> 45:43.280
and the president of the United States.

45:43.360 --> 45:46.320
We're designating an operator
to make the call.

45:46.400 --> 45:47.760
It's a great responsibility,

45:47.840 --> 45:50.680
and I hope the chosen person
takes it as such.

45:51.280 --> 45:54.400
That person is... Lidia Aguilar.

45:55.080 --> 45:56.000
Me?

45:57.000 --> 45:58.320
I can't do it.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.760
Excuse me, Miss Aguilar?

45:59.840 --> 46:03.320
I'm new here at the company.
It's too much responsibility.

46:03.400 --> 46:06.520
-It should be Ángeles.
-I agree.

46:06.600 --> 46:09.160
It wasn't my decision to make.
It was management's.

46:09.240 --> 46:11.000
So I hope you can carry out your task.

46:12.040 --> 46:14.120
The operator protocol.

46:14.200 --> 46:16.120
Learn it as if your life depended on it.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.720
I can assure you, it does.

46:19.640 --> 46:23.160
The other switchboards
will be disconnected for ten minutes.

46:23.240 --> 46:26.560
So all you need to do
is witness this moment.

46:34.680 --> 46:36.880
-I won't do it.
-The protocol is simple.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.560
You managed the jacks well yesterday.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.640
-I don't mean--
-If anything goes wrong,

46:40.720 --> 46:42.360
other girls will cover you.

46:46.560 --> 46:49.240
This is a crucial moment
for the company, Carlos.

46:50.320 --> 46:52.280
You're jeopardizing it
to seduce an operator.

46:52.360 --> 46:54.040
You sound like my father.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.960
You think I'm doing this to seduce her?

46:58.040 --> 47:01.240
-Carlos--
-I like her image for the company.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.680
She's an ambitious girl.
I think she'll do it well.

47:03.760 --> 47:07.360
-Why didn't you ask me?
-I have to ask you about everything?

47:09.880 --> 47:12.080
Staff selection is my job.

47:14.800 --> 47:16.800
Trust me, please.

47:18.440 --> 47:20.840
Expectations are high among the media

47:20.920 --> 47:23.800
<i>here on the tenth floor</i>
<i>of the Telephone Company.</i>

47:23.880 --> 47:26.520
<i>Today, at exactly noon,</i>
<i>an event will take place</i>

47:26.600 --> 47:30.160
<i>that will mark</i>
<i>a before and after in history...</i>

47:30.240 --> 47:33.880
<i>The first intercontinental call</i>
<i>made from our country,</i>

47:33.960 --> 47:38.560
<i>involving two major figures</i>
<i>on either side of the Atlantic.</i>

47:40.680 --> 47:41.840
[crowd applauding]

47:41.920 --> 47:43.400
<i>His Majesty Alfonso XIII,</i>

47:43.480 --> 47:47.680
<i>whose arrival at the Telephone Company</i>
<i>we are about to witness,</i>

47:52.000 --> 47:54.360
<i>will speak to President Coolidge</i>
<i>in an exchange</i>

47:54.440 --> 47:58.280
<i>that will affirm the strong relationship</i>
<i>between our countries.</i>

48:01.560 --> 48:03.880
[Alba] <i>I wasn't afraid of the challenge.</i>

48:03.960 --> 48:06.440
<i>But it would make my objective</i>
<i>harder to achieve.</i>

48:09.440 --> 48:14.400
<i>While the whole world was wrapped up</i>
<i>in that great historical event...</i>

48:15.960 --> 48:17.640
<i>I'd rob the safe.</i>

48:18.160 --> 48:22.920
<i>I'd put an end to Beltrán's blackmail</i>
<i>and flee in search of a new life...</i>

48:24.360 --> 48:26.000
<i>far from my past,</i>

48:26.720 --> 48:29.600
<i>and far from the man</i>
<i>who was once the love of my life.</i>

48:44.520 --> 48:47.320
-It's time, Father.
-Very well.

48:47.400 --> 48:50.920
When you wish, Your Majesty.
The world awaits.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.080
Good morning. Telephone Company.
How may I help you?

49:13.160 --> 49:15.760
Yes, operator?

49:15.840 --> 49:20.480
Could you please connect me
with Washington, United States?

49:20.560 --> 49:23.480
<i>Number 0002, with the president.</i>

49:23.560 --> 49:25.400
Of course, Your Majesty.

49:25.480 --> 49:28.560
I'm connecting you now.
One moment, please.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.280
I've lost the line.

50:06.240 --> 50:08.600
[Francisco] We checked the circuits.
There must be a signal.

50:08.680 --> 50:09.840
[Sara] You're doing something wrong.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.880
[Alba] There's no signal.

50:12.960 --> 50:16.960
Jack one to jack two... It's off.

50:25.640 --> 50:27.120
[panting]

50:37.600 --> 50:38.720
[in English] Hello?

50:39.640 --> 50:41.240
Washington, DC?

50:50.800 --> 50:55.080
[Alba] <i>An historic day.</i>
<i>A triumph for communications.</i>

50:55.160 --> 50:58.480
<i>The world in the hands of a woman,</i>
<i>a switchboard operator.</i>

50:58.560 --> 51:00.440
[Alfonso XIII in English]
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

51:00.520 --> 51:02.240
[Alba] <i>Everyone was celebrating</i>
<i>this incredible event</i>

51:02.320 --> 51:04.880
<i>and felt they were part</i>
<i>of a new world...</i>

51:04.960 --> 51:08.240
<i>But some women began to understand</i>
<i>that the new world</i>

51:08.320 --> 51:11.400
<i>wasn't as idyllic or as simple</i>
<i>as they would have liked...</i>

51:12.160 --> 51:16.120
