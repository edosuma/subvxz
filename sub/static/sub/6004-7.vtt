00:03.201 --> 00:05.536
Nova Prime: I trust you are all
familiar with Ronan the accuser.

00:05.537 --> 00:08.455
Fanatic, ruthless, power-mad.

00:08.456 --> 00:09.540
And fortunately,

00:09.541 --> 00:12.176
now no longer among the living.

00:12.177 --> 00:15.129
However, his elimination
means that Thanos,

00:15.130 --> 00:17.214
the greatest threat to our galaxy,

00:17.215 --> 00:18.599
is now without a general.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.385
<i>Ronan's absence from
Thanos' inner circle</i>

00:21.386 --> 00:23.437
<i>has created a power vacuum.</i>

00:23.438 --> 00:25.272
Where is this power vacuum?

00:25.273 --> 00:27.224
I will find it and use it

00:27.225 --> 00:29.393
to cleanse the galaxy of all those scum!

00:29.394 --> 00:31.145
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Drax!

00:31.146 --> 00:33.197
Stop swingin' that thing
around, you d'ast fool!

00:33.198 --> 00:35.232
I will not, Rocket.

00:35.233 --> 00:38.235
Ronan used this weapon
to destroy my family!

00:38.236 --> 00:40.487
I will use it to destroy Thanos!

00:40.488 --> 00:41.572
(Grunts)

00:41.573 --> 00:43.240
I am Groot!

00:43.241 --> 00:46.577
Put the universal weapon down.

00:46.578 --> 00:48.378
(Groans quietly)

00:48.379 --> 00:50.547
And quit sulking like a baby.

00:50.548 --> 00:53.584
I am sulking like a full-grown man.

00:53.585 --> 00:55.586
Who sleeps with a Dolly.

00:55.587 --> 00:58.305
I told you that in confidence, Quill.

00:58.306 --> 01:00.557
And Mr. Rhinopus
belonged to my daughter!

01:00.558 --> 01:02.392
You confided in Quill?

01:02.393 --> 01:05.262
He couldn't keep a secret
if his life depended on it.

01:05.263 --> 01:08.348
Or hold a map still while
I'm trying to navigate.

01:08.349 --> 01:11.318
Yeesh, take a recording, Gamora.
It lasts longer.

01:11.319 --> 01:12.402
Good idea.

01:13.321 --> 01:15.272
Will you losers pipe down

01:15.273 --> 01:17.324
so as I can spy on Nova Corps in peace?

01:17.325 --> 01:20.360
<i>We believe Thanos</i> <i>will be
naming his</i> <i>new general shortly,</i>

01:20.361 --> 01:25.115
<i>based on communications</i> <i>we've intercepted
between</i> <i>Ronan's former lieutenants,</i>

01:25.116 --> 01:28.452
<i>Korath, Nebula and Gamora.</i>

01:29.454 --> 01:31.505
What is the meaning of this?

01:31.506 --> 01:33.540
I am no traitor!

01:33.541 --> 01:35.626
Says the lady who betrayed Thanos.

01:35.627 --> 01:38.295
So how come Nova Corps thinks

01:38.296 --> 01:40.214
you're keepin' in touch
with Korath and Nebula?

01:40.215 --> 01:43.383
What? Kids plannin' a surprise
party for "daddy" Thanos?

01:43.384 --> 01:45.469
Easy.

01:45.470 --> 01:47.471
It's not like Nova Corps is the most
trustworthy source of information.

01:47.472 --> 01:49.439
(Coughs) Titus.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.608
Why did you think I hacked into
their comm feed in the first place?

01:51.609 --> 01:53.527
I can't speak for Nova Corps.

01:53.528 --> 01:55.362
But I won't stay one more moment

01:55.363 --> 01:57.281
with a team that doesn't trust me.

01:59.651 --> 02:02.319
We get it, Gamora. You
were raised by Thanos,

02:02.320 --> 02:05.239
you used to work for Ronan, you
turned your back on both of 'em.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.456
Water under the bridge.

02:06.457 --> 02:07.574
(Explosion) Drax: Where is this bridge?

02:07.575 --> 02:09.376
Will we find Thanos there?

02:09.377 --> 02:11.545
Oy! No, it means we trust her.

02:11.546 --> 02:13.213
(Beeping)

02:15.500 --> 02:18.218
See that reading? My
boom box doesn't lie.

02:18.219 --> 02:20.504
The Cosmic Seed is right
here on planet Sarawat!

02:21.472 --> 02:23.340
(Computer processing)

02:23.341 --> 02:25.592
Or it was here, and now it's, um...

02:25.593 --> 02:27.227
There.

02:27.228 --> 02:28.262
In that place.

02:31.432 --> 02:34.318
Gamora: I doubt the cosmic
seed was ever on Sarawat.

02:34.319 --> 02:36.236
It's supposed to accelerate life,

02:36.237 --> 02:38.155
but I don't see much evidence of that.

02:38.156 --> 02:39.356
(Thudding)

02:41.359 --> 02:43.160
(Roaring)

02:43.161 --> 02:44.494
Except for that.

03:01.089 --> 03:02.873
Peter: Okay, here's an idea.

03:02.874 --> 03:04.925
Let's get out of here
before that thing eats us!

03:06.261 --> 03:08.178
Retro-jets are failing!

03:11.266 --> 03:13.133
Guns ain't doin' it either!

03:13.134 --> 03:14.768
If The Cosmic Seed was here,

03:14.769 --> 03:16.220
that thing must've absorbed its energy.

03:16.221 --> 03:19.890
We need to dislodge it from the
ship before that thing absorbs us.

03:19.891 --> 03:21.141
I am Groot!

03:21.142 --> 03:24.028
Good idea. I've been
wantin' to try 'em out.

03:24.029 --> 03:26.063
Rocket: I put a lot of
sweat into those space pods,

03:26.064 --> 03:27.982
so don't scratch the paint!

03:27.983 --> 03:29.883
Peter: The only thing
I plan on scratchin'

03:29.884 --> 03:31.151
is old space squid here.

03:32.988 --> 03:34.204
I am Groot.

03:34.205 --> 03:36.073
No kidding, nothing's happening!

03:38.209 --> 03:41.078
Haven't you done enough damage
with that universal weapon?

03:41.079 --> 03:43.998
No. I believe I can do
considerably more damage

03:43.999 --> 03:45.215
than I have thus far.

03:46.134 --> 03:47.217
Observe.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.005
(Squid snarls)

03:54.092 --> 03:57.177
Yeah, damage to us!

03:57.178 --> 04:00.147
Peter: So maybe we can do
more damage from the inside!

04:00.148 --> 04:02.933
Rocket: You wanna get
eaten? That's disgusting.

04:02.934 --> 04:05.819
Peter: This from the guy who
eats from the garbage unit.

04:05.820 --> 04:07.771
Rocket: I was cleaning it!

04:07.772 --> 04:10.074
Peter: With your tongue?

04:10.075 --> 04:12.242
Rocket: At least I use
my tongue for eatin',

04:12.243 --> 04:15.195
and not blabbing stuff that
ain't nobody's business!

04:17.115 --> 04:19.166
Told you Quill can't keep a secret.

04:19.166 --> 04:21.000
Peter: Creatures, twelve o'clock!

04:24.789 --> 04:26.206
Not true! I never said a word

04:26.207 --> 04:28.792
about that fungus on Groot's butt!

04:28.793 --> 04:31.095
Groot: I am Groot.

04:31.096 --> 04:33.797
Peter: Hey, Gamora, this
creature's like an amoeba, right?

04:33.798 --> 04:36.850
Gamora on receiver: <i>If you mean a
single-cell</i> <i>bio-organism, then yes.</i>

04:36.851 --> 04:40.054
So that's probably the nucleus! We
ice that, we ice the whole thing!

04:41.189 --> 04:43.941
Fine. One distraction comin' up.

04:48.063 --> 04:49.947
You want some of this?

04:49.948 --> 04:51.115
(Laughs)

04:51.116 --> 04:52.950
I am Groot!

04:54.069 --> 04:56.120
Rocket: You owe me a space pod, Quill!

05:01.826 --> 05:03.827
Make that two space pods!

05:07.832 --> 05:09.133
(Roaring)

05:15.173 --> 05:16.807
Peter: Where's the <i>Milano?</i>

05:16.808 --> 05:18.759
Okay, Gamora, very funny, ha, ha.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.177
Now come pick us up...

05:20.178 --> 05:21.812
Gamora?

05:21.813 --> 05:23.013
I am Groot.

05:23.014 --> 05:24.848
She ain't in trouble.

05:24.849 --> 05:26.183
She's ditchin' us!

05:29.154 --> 05:31.772
Drax: We never should have trusted her!

05:31.773 --> 05:33.941
Peter: Looks like we never
should have trusted her piloting.

05:35.110 --> 05:38.028
Gamora! Explain your actions!

05:39.864 --> 05:42.249
Where is she? I dunno,
but her space pod's gone.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.951
I am Groot! I am Groot!

05:43.952 --> 05:45.953
Good idea. I better check.

05:48.039 --> 05:50.124
Quill's boom box is gone?

05:50.125 --> 05:51.959
(Exclaims) I'm shocked.

05:51.960 --> 05:55.129
Shocked, I say! See my face?
This is my shocked face.

05:55.130 --> 05:57.131
Oh, come on, guys.

05:57.132 --> 06:00.801
This is Gamora... Who maybe hit that
big blob on purpose to get rid of us!

06:00.802 --> 06:02.052
What if Nova Corps is right

06:02.053 --> 06:03.854
and she's been working
for Thanos the whole time?

06:03.855 --> 06:05.139
Or she was kidnapped,

06:05.140 --> 06:07.725
or forced to betray us against her will.

06:07.726 --> 06:10.811
That is easily the stupidest
thing I have ever heard.

06:10.812 --> 06:12.780
I am Groot.

06:12.781 --> 06:14.064
You got that right, bud.

06:14.065 --> 06:16.817
You know you're in trouble
when Drax is the smart one.

06:16.818 --> 06:19.987
Fortunately, I put
tracers on everything!

06:19.988 --> 06:21.121
Everything?

06:26.161 --> 06:28.128
I am Groot?

06:28.129 --> 06:30.881
Everything. Including the pods.

06:30.882 --> 06:33.834
So as I can nab the
little green backstabber!

06:33.835 --> 06:35.969
Peter: I'm sure this is all
one big misunderstanding!

06:35.970 --> 06:38.088
Besides, you guys gotta
stay here and fix the ship.

06:40.809 --> 06:42.226
I am Groot!

06:51.269 --> 06:52.936
(Computer processing)

06:54.155 --> 06:56.774
Okay, her pod's showing damage.

06:56.775 --> 06:57.825
That's not good.

07:07.085 --> 07:08.786
And that's even worse.

07:13.124 --> 07:14.124
(Grunts)

07:15.844 --> 07:18.762
Don't worry, you're safe.

07:18.763 --> 07:21.048
(Exclaims) What are you
doing? You'll ruin everything!

07:21.049 --> 07:22.099
Go away!

07:28.223 --> 07:30.140
Hello, sister.

07:30.141 --> 07:32.142
You called. I came.

07:32.143 --> 07:34.945
Now show me what I want.

07:34.946 --> 07:37.030
Um, why is Thanos' other daughter here

07:37.031 --> 07:38.816
and why is she not
trying to kill you yet?

07:39.984 --> 07:41.201
(Grunts)

07:41.202 --> 07:43.153
Nebula, you're late.

07:43.154 --> 07:45.906
Korath's spies must
have learned of our plan.

07:45.907 --> 07:48.125
He ambushed me and took the cryptocube.

07:48.126 --> 07:50.878
Wait, Korath has my boom box?

07:50.879 --> 07:52.796
Oh, man, Gamora, what have you done?

07:52.797 --> 07:57.885
Together, we can take it back,
and regain Thanos' good graces!

07:57.886 --> 08:00.838
So the Nova Corps rumors are true.

08:00.839 --> 08:02.923
You do want to be his general.

08:02.924 --> 08:05.726
But why include me in your scheme?

08:05.727 --> 08:08.061
Because we cannot allow Korath

08:08.062 --> 08:10.180
to become our father's favorite.

08:12.817 --> 08:14.735
Okay, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:14.736 --> 08:16.019
None of this makes any sense.

08:17.772 --> 08:19.740
Oh, unless it's a plot to take her down!

08:19.741 --> 08:21.942
Nice, Gamora. I knew we could trust y...

08:21.943 --> 08:22.943
Oh!

08:24.195 --> 08:26.947
You should have trusted Nova Prime.

08:26.948 --> 08:28.031
(Groans)

08:28.867 --> 08:31.001
Gamora... no...

08:31.002 --> 08:34.203
You still need to prove
that I can trust you.

08:34.205 --> 08:36.089
End him.

08:36.090 --> 08:37.124
Now.

08:44.077 --> 08:45.243
I can't kill him.

08:45.244 --> 08:47.362
We need him to operate the cryptocube.

08:47.363 --> 08:51.033
Why would we need this fool
to operate an empty box?

08:51.034 --> 08:52.084
Uh...

08:52.085 --> 08:53.919
No reason...

08:53.920 --> 08:55.954
Right, Gamora?

08:55.955 --> 08:58.206
The pandorian crystals interact
within the cryptocube to form a map

08:58.207 --> 09:00.008
to The Cosmic Seed.

09:00.009 --> 09:02.127
He's the only one who
can work the thing.

09:02.128 --> 09:04.179
Why do you think I let him follow me?

09:04.180 --> 09:06.882
And you say I can't keep a secret?

09:06.883 --> 09:11.019
Maybe I'll just take
him and vaporize you.

09:11.020 --> 09:14.272
If you thought you could beat Korath
without me, you would have already done that.

09:14.273 --> 09:18.226
Or you could just let me go and
then nobody gets the cryptocube...

09:18.227 --> 09:20.228
(Grunts)

09:26.285 --> 09:29.955
Chitauri helmsman: <i>Mistress Nebula, we
are</i> <i>closing in on Korath's ship.</i>

09:29.956 --> 09:33.909
Gamora: He hasn't spotted us yet so
we still have the element of surprise.

09:35.128 --> 09:38.163
Nice room. Time to leave.

09:48.141 --> 09:51.393
There's a weak spot in the shield
generator near Korath's main thrusters.

09:51.394 --> 09:54.179
Hit him there, and we gain
the maneuvering advantage.

09:54.180 --> 09:56.014
Chitauri helmsman: Lord
Korath has spotted us.

09:56.015 --> 09:58.266
Korath: <i>Nebula!</i> <i>What are
you doing</i> <i>in this sector?</i>

09:58.267 --> 10:00.936
As if you didn't know, Korath.

10:00.937 --> 10:05.240
I'm on a mission for the master,
which you are endangering, you troll!

10:05.241 --> 10:09.244
<i>The only thing I endanger</i> <i>is your
serving the cause</i> <i>of your real master,</i>

10:09.245 --> 10:11.029
<i>the traitor Ronan!</i>

10:11.030 --> 10:15.117
I had a fondness for
Ronan, but he is gone.

10:15.118 --> 10:17.252
I serve our father, Thanos.

10:17.253 --> 10:21.289
In any event, you lie. Gamora told
me that your spies attacked her

10:21.290 --> 10:22.424
and took the object!

10:22.425 --> 10:24.960
<i>You lie!</i>

10:24.961 --> 10:28.130
<i>Gamora herself</i> <i>told me to meet her
here</i> <i>to receive the cryptocube!</i>

10:28.131 --> 10:29.381
<i>Prepare for battle!</i>

10:31.017 --> 10:34.136
Or she's been lying to us both.

10:34.137 --> 10:36.021
Gamora, explain yourself!

10:38.307 --> 10:39.307
Shaktah!

10:39.308 --> 10:42.027
Groot, you twit-brained gronka.

10:42.028 --> 10:44.196
You were supposed to
keep Quill on the ship.

10:44.197 --> 10:47.149
He almost blew everything
with his big mouth.

10:47.150 --> 10:48.150
(Grunts)

10:51.454 --> 10:54.156
Groot: I am Groot.

10:54.157 --> 10:56.241
Gamora: <i>Yeah, I've
heard that before.</i>

10:56.242 --> 10:59.411
<i>Just get the repairs done.</i> <i>I'll signal
you when</i> <i>we're ready for pickup.</i>

10:59.412 --> 11:00.912
Groot!

11:00.913 --> 11:02.414
How could ya?

11:02.415 --> 11:06.334
After all we been through, you're
in cahoots with that traitor Gamora?

11:06.335 --> 11:08.303
I am Groot!

11:08.304 --> 11:10.055
I am Groot! I am Groot!

11:10.056 --> 11:12.007
Explain yourself, tree!

11:12.008 --> 11:14.976
Wait, you had the box this whole time?

11:14.977 --> 11:18.180
I am Groot! I am Groot!

11:18.181 --> 11:23.101
If Gamora did not steal the
cryptocube, then what did she do?

11:23.436 --> 11:24.986
I...

11:24.987 --> 11:26.354
Am Groot.

11:28.107 --> 11:29.074
(Snarls)

11:30.109 --> 11:31.159
(Grunting)

11:38.084 --> 11:42.370
Of course he's gone. Well, he isn't
Quill if he's not ruining my plans.

11:48.044 --> 11:49.294
(Sighs)

11:49.295 --> 11:51.096
(Screaming)

12:04.227 --> 12:05.193
(Grunts)

12:12.401 --> 12:14.202
(Continues screaming)

12:14.203 --> 12:16.154
Gamora! You okay?

12:17.156 --> 12:19.324
Am I okay? What about you?

12:19.325 --> 12:21.910
Sorry about knocking you out earlier.

12:21.911 --> 12:23.328
Meh. I knew it was just a setup.

12:23.329 --> 12:25.380
Based on... what?

12:25.381 --> 12:27.966
We're friends, G. I trust you.

12:27.967 --> 12:30.302
So how 'bout trusting me
and let me in on your plan?

12:35.091 --> 12:39.144
<i>Nebula!</i> <i>The truth now, or
I will</i> <i>fire on your ship!</i>

12:39.145 --> 12:42.063
Not if I fire on your ship first!

12:43.983 --> 12:45.016
(Grunts)

12:47.103 --> 12:48.403
You devious little minx!

12:48.404 --> 12:51.323
I knew it, but why
didn't you just tell us?

12:51.324 --> 12:53.358
I figured if I could
make Korath and Nebula

12:53.359 --> 12:55.076
suspicious enough of each other,

12:55.077 --> 12:57.412
they'd fight, and take each other out.

12:57.413 --> 13:01.116
I couldn't risk Nebula discovering
the truth if any of you got caught.

13:01.117 --> 13:04.169
I told Groot because I
knew he can keep a secret.

13:04.170 --> 13:06.121
You, not so much.

13:06.122 --> 13:07.339
Ouch. (Blows)

13:09.125 --> 13:11.126
(Muffled gasp)

13:11.127 --> 13:14.379
You call my plans reckless? Now why would
you risk Korath getting the boom box?

13:15.965 --> 13:17.299
Unless you didn't...

13:17.300 --> 13:19.134
Because it was on the
<i>Milano</i> all along!

13:19.135 --> 13:22.270
But you had to hide it to
make it look convincing, right?

13:22.271 --> 13:25.974
Oh. Well, it's a good thing they don't
know you crashed the ship back on Sarawat,

13:25.975 --> 13:27.142
and it's sitting there helpless.

13:27.143 --> 13:28.310
(Chuckles)

13:28.311 --> 13:31.279
Oh... hey, Nebula!

13:31.280 --> 13:33.365
You didn't hear what I just said, right?

13:33.366 --> 13:38.036
Not that it was important, because I never
say anything important, just ask Gamora!

13:38.037 --> 13:41.323
Korath, new plan.

13:41.324 --> 13:45.377
Nebula: <i>We fly to Sarawat,</i> <i>eliminate
the</i> Milano <i>and its pathetic crew,</i>

13:45.378 --> 13:47.412
<i>and sort things out from there.</i>

13:47.413 --> 13:51.383
Korath: <i>Agreed.</i> <i>The
Guardians</i> <i>will be destroyed!</i>

13:52.301 --> 13:54.419
Well, that ain't good.

13:56.577 --> 14:00.347
So we got two nutjobs in killer
spaceships heading our way.

14:00.348 --> 14:02.215
And we ain't about to fly.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.517
But maybe we can hide.

14:04.402 --> 14:05.352
Cloak us!

14:09.323 --> 14:10.357
(Circuits scrambling)

14:10.358 --> 14:12.108
I am Groot.

14:12.109 --> 14:14.411
What do you mean the cloak's busted?

14:14.412 --> 14:18.532
I believe he means the device that
camouflages our ship has ceased to function...

14:18.533 --> 14:20.333
I know what he means!

14:26.457 --> 14:28.325
Lock weapons on the <i>Milano.</i>

14:32.530 --> 14:35.198
The ship has disappeared.

14:40.271 --> 14:45.225
It must be cloaked. Carpet-bomb
the region and sort it out later.

14:45.226 --> 14:47.561
Peter: Psst, Gamora.
Remember when we met?

14:47.562 --> 14:49.563
You mean when I tried to vaporize you?

14:49.564 --> 14:51.314
Yeah, only you didn't 'cause...

14:51.315 --> 14:52.365
This!

14:55.620 --> 14:56.570
(Screams)

15:04.412 --> 15:05.495
Gamora!

15:06.414 --> 15:08.465
Nope! Just me!

15:08.466 --> 15:09.466
Ah!

15:11.252 --> 15:13.336
But I did learn a few moves from her.

15:13.337 --> 15:15.088
All right, Korath.

15:15.089 --> 15:17.390
Here's a little present
from your sister Nebula.

15:23.230 --> 15:25.315
(Alarm blaring)

15:25.316 --> 15:28.184
Raise the shields! Weapons on line. Now!

15:30.404 --> 15:33.189
This would be a good time
to let you know I told Korath

15:33.190 --> 15:35.275
where the weak points
are on Nebula's ship.

15:35.276 --> 15:38.111
<i>You dare fire on me, Nebula?</i>

15:38.112 --> 15:39.579
Nice shot, Nebula!

15:39.580 --> 15:43.166
Korath had no idea you were secretly
working with us the whole time!

15:43.167 --> 15:46.503
Oh wait, I probably
shouldn't have said that.

15:46.504 --> 15:48.288
<i>I should have known.</i>

15:48.289 --> 15:51.341
<i>You sisters have always
sided against me!</i>

16:10.144 --> 16:13.146
You look busy, so we'll just get
out of your hair, so to speak.

16:16.367 --> 16:19.452
You have no idea what
you've started, sister!

16:22.406 --> 16:24.457
I wanted my siblings to fight.

16:24.458 --> 16:27.160
Just never thought I'd
be caught in the middle.

16:27.161 --> 16:30.296
Groot! We're in trouble up
here, we could really use a lift!

16:30.297 --> 16:33.550
Oh, hey, Gammy, so good to hear from
you, but we got our own problems!

16:33.551 --> 16:36.503
The fuel cells are empty and I got
no way to jump-start the reactor...

16:37.505 --> 16:39.472
Uh, Drax, what're you doing?

16:39.473 --> 16:42.475
I do not know if this will
work as well as a power vacuum,

16:42.476 --> 16:44.394
but we shall see!

16:52.186 --> 16:53.269
Ah!

16:53.270 --> 16:55.488
I am Groot!

16:57.358 --> 17:01.244
Rocket: Whoa! Too much
power. I can't slow down!

17:01.245 --> 17:04.196
Rocket, if you're trying to teach
me a lesson about leaving you behind,

17:04.198 --> 17:06.031
this is not the time.

17:06.032 --> 17:08.201
Forget Rocket, get us
out of this crossfire!

17:27.438 --> 17:31.141
Okay. Ow... that did not
work as well as I'd hoped.

17:31.142 --> 17:32.525
It's about to get worse.

17:34.195 --> 17:35.445
Here comes Korath.

17:38.482 --> 17:41.151
Did I mention that I
hate family reunions?

17:41.152 --> 17:43.203
Tell me about it.

17:43.204 --> 17:45.321
You will pay for this deception, sister.

17:45.322 --> 17:46.322
(Screams)

18:02.223 --> 18:04.257
Drax, stop feeding the d'ast reactor!

18:04.258 --> 18:06.059
The ship's about to fry!

18:07.178 --> 18:08.228
(Grunting)

18:23.110 --> 18:24.527
(Both grunting)

18:31.118 --> 18:33.286
I will be Thanos' general.

18:33.287 --> 18:36.172
And I will start by destroying you!

18:36.173 --> 18:37.423
Good luck with that.

18:40.511 --> 18:41.461
(Groans)

18:45.299 --> 18:46.466
(Sighs in relief)

18:46.467 --> 18:48.218
Ah, crud.

18:49.386 --> 18:52.138
Not now!

18:52.139 --> 18:56.526
Don't worry, vermin. I'll find the
cryptocube in your charred wreckage.

19:01.532 --> 19:05.151
You will find nothing, ever again!

19:11.492 --> 19:12.492
Ah!

19:20.551 --> 19:25.171
Now I have done enough
damage with that thing.

19:26.173 --> 19:27.390
Time to go, guardians!

19:29.560 --> 19:32.312
I must retrieve the universal weapon!

19:32.313 --> 19:34.314
Gamora: <i>Inbound necrocraft!</i>

19:34.315 --> 19:36.432
Peter: <i>Drax? Gotta
leave it, buddy.</i>

19:52.199 --> 19:54.534
Thanos will be most interested in this.

20:03.177 --> 20:04.210
(Groans)

20:07.464 --> 20:09.549
This may not be the cryptocube,

20:09.550 --> 20:13.469
but it will certainly help
me continue Ronan's mission.

20:16.223 --> 20:18.308
Drax: One thing still troubles me.

20:18.309 --> 20:22.145
If you never really betrayed us,
why did Nova Corps report that

20:22.146 --> 20:24.197
you had returned to Thanos?

20:24.198 --> 20:28.318
I tipped them off. Korath and
Nebula had to think I had turned.

20:28.319 --> 20:31.487
See? I knew she'd never
stab us in the back.

20:31.488 --> 20:36.242
True. If I really wanted to betray
you, I'd stab you in the front.

20:36.243 --> 20:39.379
I am Groot.

20:39.380 --> 20:41.414
You said a mouthful, bud.

20:41.415 --> 20:45.251
Next time you got some cockamamie
plan like that, tell us first,

20:45.252 --> 20:47.136
then leave us out of it!

20:47.137 --> 20:48.471
(Grunts in anger)

20:48.472 --> 20:51.557
Hey, just so you know,
I can keep a secret.

20:51.558 --> 20:55.178
And I'll keep yours, you know,
about how much Nebula and Korath know

20:55.179 --> 20:56.429
about the boom box.

20:56.430 --> 20:59.232
My secrets have caused
too much trouble already.

20:59.233 --> 21:00.516
You should all know,

21:00.517 --> 21:05.104
I told Nebula about the star
map on Quill's cryptocube.

21:05.105 --> 21:07.240
Korath probably knows too.

21:07.241 --> 21:12.195
Which means we have serious
competition to find The Cosmic Seed.

21:12.196 --> 21:15.498
But we've learned that if we work
together, and trust each other,

21:15.499 --> 21:17.333
we can overcome any foe.

21:17.334 --> 21:20.420
I cannot wait to meet
Thanos' minions again.

21:20.421 --> 21:25.541
It will only bring me closer to
my revenge on the tyrant himself!

21:25.542 --> 21:27.210
Uh-oh.

21:28.295 --> 21:30.430
Yeah, we're hosed.
