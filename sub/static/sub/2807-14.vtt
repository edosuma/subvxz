00:08.675 --> 00:11.427
- Hey. What's up?
- I left my guitar here again.

00:11.594 --> 00:14.013
Oh, okay. No problem.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.351
- Okay. Here you go.
- Okay.

00:19.519 --> 00:20.978
Okay, um...

00:24.107 --> 00:27.151
- What?
- You want to hang out or something?

00:27.777 --> 00:30.195
Phoebe, you caught me at a bad time.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.406
- Oh, are you and Chandler...?
- Yes. Exactly.

00:32.573 --> 00:35.117
- Okay. Want me to play for you?
- No.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.873
Hey, Pheebs, what's up?

00:43.626 --> 00:47.588
You ask an intriguing question,
Chandler Bing.

00:51.051 --> 00:56.680
Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?
You never let me massage you.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.934
- Phoebe, I can explain.
- You told me you hate massages.

01:01.144 --> 01:05.438
Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.
Don't let Phoebe in.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.651
I can't believe this.
How long has this been going on?

01:09.819 --> 01:13.530
- Well, uh, Alexandra has...
- Oh, it has a name?

01:15.241 --> 01:16.992
Phoebe, don't get upset.

01:17.160 --> 01:22.414
Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.
Come on, Chandler, let's go.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.584
Well, I thought I'd...

01:25.752 --> 01:27.586
Yeah, what the hell.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.378
- Okay, come on. One more push.
- Unh!

02:10.547 --> 02:12.297
Come on, we're almost there.

02:12.465 --> 02:16.718
Joey, I'm so happy things worked out
for us and we're having this baby together.

02:16.886 --> 02:19.596
- I love you so much.
- Oh, I love you too.

02:19.764 --> 02:23.058
Mm. I hope it's not
an inappropriate time to say this...

02:23.226 --> 02:25.686
...but you're the best sex I've ever had.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.857
- That's always appropriate.
- Ha, ha.

02:30.024 --> 02:32.776
Okay, come on, one more push.
One more push.

02:35.738 --> 02:36.780
There we go.

02:38.533 --> 02:44.788
Here is your beautiful baby.
Congratulations.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.174
I hope you're a better father
than you are a friend!

02:57.969 --> 02:59.928
Whoa! Aah, whoa.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.056
- Joey!
- What, what?

03:03.224 --> 03:06.727
- What's going on? Uh...
- Feel this. Come feel my belly.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.897
The baby's kicking for the first time.
Please come feel.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.982
- Really? Uh...
- Yes.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.902
You know what? Maybe, uh, you...

03:15.069 --> 03:16.820
Maybe you should come to me.

03:16.988 --> 03:20.240
- I'm not wearing any bottoms.
- Oh, okay.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.745
- Oh, my God.
- Aah!

03:24.913 --> 03:26.705
It's unbelievable!

03:26.873 --> 03:30.584
Wow, she is kicking so much.
She's like, um...

03:30.752 --> 03:33.795
Who's that kind of
annoying girl soccer player?

03:33.963 --> 03:36.924
- Mia Hamm?
- Mia Hamm!

03:37.675 --> 03:40.594
- Oh! It's amazing.
- Whoa. One hand on the sheet, Joe.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.805
Whoa, eh. Sorry.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.103
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, honey.

03:50.271 --> 03:55.442
We got a wedding gift from Bob and
Faye Bing. They don't like us, do they?

03:56.110 --> 04:00.113
Who says you can't get
a nice punch bowl for under $6?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.950
- Maybe we can take it back.
- Doesn't say where it's from.

04:03.117 --> 04:06.536
- Where would we return it?
- How about to the street, from the balcony?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.748
Why don't we just find a place for it?

04:13.503 --> 04:15.212
How about in that cabinet?

04:15.380 --> 04:16.964
That's where we keep canned goods.

04:17.130 --> 04:20.216
Have you forgotten everything
you learned in orientation?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.055
How about the closet by the bathroom?

04:25.223 --> 04:27.266
Oh. Okay.
Why don't you let me do it.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.184
No, no, no. I will do it.

04:29.352 --> 04:34.564
You have to relax and let your husband
take care of things once in a while.

04:34.732 --> 04:37.317
It's locked. You have to help me.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.027
Why is it locked?

04:39.487 --> 04:42.656
No reason.
I keep private things in there.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.783
You know, I've been living here a while...

04:44.951 --> 04:47.077
...and I've never seen
what's in that closet.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.246
What is in there?

04:49.998 --> 04:51.290
Feminine stuff.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.960
Don't try to make me uncomfortable
with feminine stuff!

04:55.169 --> 05:00.424
Nothing in there concerns you.
If you love me, you'll just let it go.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.762
- Fine.
- Thank you.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.853
Love you.

05:14.397 --> 05:18.608
Hello, Chandler.
Lovely day, huh? You.

05:20.695 --> 05:24.906
If it helps, Alexandra's only been
massaging Monica for, like, three years.

05:27.618 --> 05:30.996
If! I said, if it helps.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.042
Why won't you let me massage you?

05:35.209 --> 05:38.962
Uh, well, it's... I'd be self-conscious.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.131
You're my friend. I'd be naked.

05:41.299 --> 05:45.177
We lived together for years.
I've seen you naked.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.805
That's different. We were roommates.
And when?

05:50.850 --> 05:53.643
I'm curious about the human body.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.856
You can understand
why this would be weird for me.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.817
I'm a professional
and I'm really good.

06:00.985 --> 06:05.697
If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.
Just give me a chance, okay? Please?

06:06.324 --> 06:08.533
Okay, if it means that much to you.

06:08.701 --> 06:12.162
It does. How would you feel
if you couldn't share your cooking?

06:12.330 --> 06:16.333
Or imagine how Ross would feel
if he couldn't teach us about dragons.

06:18.419 --> 06:21.546
- Dinosaurs.
- Potato, "potato."

06:25.468 --> 06:27.719
- Hey.
- Ross, the baby's kicking.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.013
What? It is?

06:35.311 --> 06:37.270
It's not kicking right now.

06:37.438 --> 06:40.982
Although we would love
to see you do that again.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.111
When was it kicking? What happened?

06:44.278 --> 06:48.073
Last night. I felt it. I went into Joey's room,
and he was sleeping.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.867
A dreamless sleep.

06:51.577 --> 06:55.288
My God, the baby's kicking.
That's great.

06:55.540 --> 07:01.128
I wish I would have been there to feel
the kicking for the first time.

07:01.337 --> 07:05.090
I got some stuff going on
in here if you want to feel.

07:05.299 --> 07:10.262
I don't want to miss any more baby
stuff. Here's my pager number.

07:10.471 --> 07:14.015
Anytime anything pregnancy-related
happens, use it. I'll be there.

07:14.183 --> 07:17.436
I don't care if it's 3 in the morning
and you want ice cream.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.104
Wow. Can I get a copy of that?

07:24.193 --> 07:26.945
- Are you under the sheet?
- Yes.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.783
Great, let's begin.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.169
- How's the pressure?
- Ah.

07:43.045 --> 07:46.256
It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.301
Stating the obvious, but thank you.

07:49.552 --> 07:53.638
- And it's not weird, is it?
- No.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.852
That's right, you just enjoy.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.440
Oh, yeah!

08:03.649 --> 08:07.652
Oh, oh!

08:08.404 --> 08:12.824
- Oh, yeah!
- Okay.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.578
Oh, God, Phoebe!

08:16.829 --> 08:21.249
Oh, that's it! That's it, right there! Oh!

08:33.011 --> 08:36.431
I wasn't trying to open your closet.
I wasn't trying, I swear.

08:37.475 --> 08:43.772
Wow. Monica runs a pretty tight ship here,
doesn't she? What are you doing?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.775
Monica has a secret closet.
She won't let me see what's in it.

08:46.943 --> 08:47.984
- Why not?
- I don't know!

08:48.152 --> 08:51.446
What could she possibly be hiding in here
what I can't see?

08:51.697 --> 08:53.865
I don't know. Ooh.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.535
I'll bet it's Richard.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.288
Why would Monica be keeping Richard
in here?

09:00.456 --> 09:02.749
Well, off the top of my head, uh...

09:02.917 --> 09:06.211
...maybe she's having her cake
and eating it too.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.006
You being the "cake,"
Richard being the "too."

09:10.174 --> 09:13.843
- Or...
- And here we go.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.054
I saw this movie once
where there was a door.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.722
Nobody knew what was behind it.

09:17.890 --> 09:23.520
And when they finally got it open, millions
and millions of bugs came pouring out...

09:23.729 --> 09:27.274
...and they feasted on human flesh!

09:28.192 --> 09:31.528
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to respect your wife's privacy!

09:36.033 --> 09:39.953
Stupid closet full of bugs!

09:41.038 --> 09:45.750
Joey, something feels weird
and not good weird. I don't... Whoa!

09:45.918 --> 09:48.753
Whoa! Don't worry.
When my sisters were pregnant...

09:48.921 --> 09:51.798
...they got every weird feeling
and it was always nothing.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.258
- Really?
- Absolutely.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.720
But we'll stop by the hospital
just to be sure. I'll page Ross.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.513
Okay, oh, God... Ow.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.641
Oh, okay, Rach, look at me.
Everything's gonna be fine.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.144
- Okay.
- Trust me. Take my hand. Here we go.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.105
Ow! Crushing bones!

10:07.315 --> 10:10.650
Good thing we're going to a hospital.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.619
- Hey. So?
- She's fine.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.954
She was experiencing
Braxton Hicks contractions.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.957
- Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.
- Hmm.

10:26.125 --> 10:31.171
Mild discomfort? I take it you've had
one of these Braxton thingies?

10:31.339 --> 10:32.964
- Everything is normal?
- Yes.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.550
- There's no danger to her or the baby?
- No.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.803
Contractions can be unnerving
if you don't know, but she's fine.

10:38.971 --> 10:43.975
Thank you, doctor.
And thank you for being nice and calm.

10:44.143 --> 10:48.188
Calm? I wasn't calm! I've never been
more scared in my life.

10:48.606 --> 10:53.401
- You said everything was okay.
- What do I know? I'm not a doctor.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.572
- But everything is okay. I'm fine.
- You sure?

10:57.782 --> 11:01.618
Yes. I got half a mind
to contract that doctor's uterus.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.829
Mild discomfort!
What's he talking about?

11:04.997 --> 11:06.831
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.168
Your page said, "Come to
the hospital." What happened?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.754
Something called
Braxton Hicks contraction.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.215
Ugh, oh. Ha, ha.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.592
That's no big deal.
Most women don't feel them.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.969
Okay, no uterus, no opinion.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.723
Hey, uh, what's with the candy?

11:23.891 --> 11:27.227
When you beeped me I was at
the concession stand at the movies.

11:27.395 --> 11:31.231
- You went to the movies by yourself?
- No... Mona!

11:32.483 --> 11:35.318
- Oh, I gotta go back in there.
- Why? What's wrong?

11:35.486 --> 11:38.822
- Everything's fine, I just gotta...
- No, really, tell me. What's up?

11:40.116 --> 11:42.367
Look, I forgot my underwear.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.374
So thanks so much
for bringing her to the hospital.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.419
Oh, hey, don't worry about it.
No big deal.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.838
But still, it should have been me.
I'm the dad.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.299
If you have questions...

11:58.467 --> 12:00.802
...here's information on Braxton Hicks.
- Thanks.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.680
And by the way, you did the right thing
by bringing her in.

12:03.848 --> 12:07.517
- You're gonna make a wonderful father.
- Oh, uh...

12:08.102 --> 12:13.273
Hey, not as good as this guy.
He brought Twizzlers.

12:18.863 --> 12:23.032
- There has got to be a way.
- Easy there, Captain Kirk.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.537
- Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
- Yeah.

12:27.788 --> 12:31.833
Oh, no, wait.
I'm not a 9-year-old girl.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.252
Then why do you throw like one?

12:35.212 --> 12:38.840
- Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
- Oh, sure, "Monica."

12:40.426 --> 12:43.845
So how's the hideously
inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?

12:44.054 --> 12:48.516
Really good. I should be ready
to kill myself any day now.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.894
Well, you sure found that quick.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.984
I just wish I didn't feel this way
about Rachel.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.153
I wish things could go back to normal.

13:00.321 --> 13:05.575
I mean, I love living with her,
and helping out with the baby is amazing.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.870
But now I think Ross feels left out.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.748
You know?
When I had to take Rachel to the hospital...

13:11.916 --> 13:14.501
...the doctor thought I was the father.
God, you...

13:14.668 --> 13:17.253
You should have seen
the look on Ross' face.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.340
By the way,
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.300
For all I know, I'm locking it more.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.553
Hey, you try opening it with a credit card?

13:25.721 --> 13:27.847
- That's a good idea. Okay.
- Yeah.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.601
- So, uh, Ross is kind of bummed, huh?
- Ugh.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.646
- I ju... I feel terrible.
- It's not your fault.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.190
What are you gonna do,
not take her to the hospital?

13:37.358 --> 13:38.733
You're doing nothing wrong.

13:38.901 --> 13:42.862
Except for harboring an all-consuming
love for the woman carrying his baby.

13:48.410 --> 13:53.122
Richard, if you're in there,
could you pass me my credit card?

13:55.459 --> 13:56.709
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:56.877 --> 14:01.506
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing.
That massage felt so good.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.050
No, no, I got that.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.636
So, um, what do you say
we make it a weekly appointment?

14:06.804 --> 14:07.846
Okay.

14:08.013 --> 14:13.268
You should know though,
I've, um, raised my rates to $200 an hour.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.354
- Okay.
- I mean 500.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.399
- What?
- 600.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.608
What's going on?

14:20.776 --> 14:23.653
Oh, you make sex noises
when you get massaged.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.947
- Wha...?
- And it really freaked me out.

14:26.115 --> 14:29.659
After a while, I even tried to hurt you
and it just spurred you on.

14:30.369 --> 14:34.414
What? You're crazy. There's nothing sexual
about the noises I make.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.207
Really? There's nothing sexual
about this?

14:37.751 --> 14:42.922
Oh, God! Oh, oh, oh!

14:43.090 --> 14:44.507
What are you looking at?

14:46.802 --> 14:48.011
I mean, hi.

14:49.763 --> 14:53.474
This is so embarrassing.
I'm never gonna get massaged again.

14:53.642 --> 14:56.644
No, you can't let this stop you
from getting massages.

14:56.854 --> 15:00.440
Look, I have lots of clients
that make the same noises you do.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.234
- Really?
- Well, not clients. Lovers.

15:05.529 --> 15:09.782
Let's just... We'll try it again. Come back,
and we'll work through it.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.785
- You sure?
- Yes.

15:12.995 --> 15:17.332
- I guess.
- Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.

15:17.499 --> 15:20.001
So did you hear something you liked?

15:24.757 --> 15:29.344
Hey, Ross, check it out!
I learned a new trick. Huh?

15:29.553 --> 15:32.639
- Hey, uh, I brought you some lunch.
- Oh!

15:32.806 --> 15:37.018
- That's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.
- Eh.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.437
Mm, mm.

15:41.023 --> 15:44.233
- Did you put pickles on this?
- Well, yeah.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.571
What? What? Rach, what?

15:48.739 --> 15:51.783
- What's going on?
- I made her favorite, tuna with pickle.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.452
Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.538
Giving her pickle is
like giving me salad.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.085
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
You gonna be okay?

16:02.252 --> 16:03.294
I'll be fine.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.172
But someone make sure
that sandwich is gone when I get out.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.716
I'm on it!

16:10.219 --> 16:13.680
I can't believe this. I shouldn't be the one
making her throw up.

16:13.847 --> 16:18.267
- Dude, relax. It could happen to anyone.
- Not to you. You know this stuff.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.187
I don't know any of it
and I'm the father.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.232
I just... I wish I could be
more involved, you know?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.319
Ugh.

16:29.196 --> 16:34.951
Well, if anyone is keeping score,
I no longer eat tuna.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.580
Hey, uh, can I talk to you guys
for a second?

16:39.748 --> 16:41.833
- Yeah.
- What's up?

16:42.001 --> 16:46.713
Well... Sit down.
I wanna talk about our situation.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.674
Are you breaking up with us?

16:51.176 --> 16:52.844
The thing is...

16:55.681 --> 16:58.933
...because I live with Rachel,
I'm here for a lot of the stuff.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.685
Okay, and Ross...

17:00.853 --> 17:05.314
Ross is missing everything. So...

17:05.523 --> 17:06.983
Yeah?

17:08.193 --> 17:10.903
Maybe you two should live together.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.573
Are you asking me to move out?
Do you not want me here?

17:13.741 --> 17:18.744
No, I love living with you.
It just seems that...

17:18.996 --> 17:23.374
...if you're gonna have a roommate,
it may as well be the father.

17:23.541 --> 17:26.752
But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me
to move in to his apartment...

17:26.920 --> 17:29.756
...and disrupt his life like that. I mean...

17:31.216 --> 17:33.593
Or he does.

17:33.761 --> 17:38.347
I would love to be around
for you and the baby.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.934
We can just try it,
like on a temporary basis.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.855
- But it's you and me.
- It wouldn't be anything romantic.

17:46.023 --> 17:50.234
And I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!

17:51.070 --> 17:54.989
I was supposed to meet her
an hour ago. What is wrong with me?

17:55.949 --> 17:58.910
So, what do you think?

17:59.119 --> 18:02.080
- I don't know. Is it crazy?
- No. No, it's not...

18:02.247 --> 18:04.290
Joey, this is a smart idea.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.960
Well, I was due.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.713
- Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
- Really?

18:10.923 --> 18:14.217
- Oh, Rach, that's great. That's great.
- Mm.

18:24.812 --> 18:28.189
Not too shabby.
I got this all off myself...

18:28.398 --> 18:31.109
...using my wife's tools.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.408
Oh, my God.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.622
How did you get in there?

18:48.168 --> 18:49.961
You're messy.

18:50.379 --> 18:55.633
- No! You weren't supposed to see this!
- I married Fred Sanford.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.802
No, Chandler, you don't understand.

19:02.349 --> 19:07.311
Okay, okay, fine! Now you know. Okay?
I'm sick.

19:07.479 --> 19:12.608
No, honey, you're not sick. I don't
love you because you're organized.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.944
I love you in spite of that.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.030
Really?

19:18.907 --> 19:21.868
- Promise you won't tell anyone?
- Yes.

19:22.077 --> 19:26.747
Now that I know, if I've got extra stuff
lying around, can we share the closet?

19:26.915 --> 19:31.210
Oh. Well, it's just, um...

19:31.378 --> 19:33.004
I'm afraid you might mess it up.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.804
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:41.972 --> 19:46.934
So Rachel's all moved out, huh?
How you taking it?

19:47.102 --> 19:49.187
Well, uh, I wanted to have a few beers...

19:49.354 --> 19:54.400
...but, uh, I got rid of those because
Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them.

19:54.568 --> 19:58.362
I have thrown back a lot
of orange juice with calcium though.

19:58.530 --> 20:04.327
And, uh, it's a couple weeks past its
expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.

20:06.997 --> 20:11.375
- Are you okay?
- You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.879
I'm, uh... I'm better than great. I am good.

20:16.673 --> 20:19.508
Now that she's gone, I can, uh...

20:19.676 --> 20:23.095
I can do all the stuff around here
that I couldn't do before. You know?

20:23.305 --> 20:25.181
Like, um...

20:25.390 --> 20:27.391
I can walk around naked again.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.061
You know? I can, uh...

20:30.229 --> 20:33.731
I can watch porn in the living room.
Right?

20:34.399 --> 20:36.359
This is, uh... This is good for me.

20:36.610 --> 20:40.863
I like being on my own.
I'm better off this way.

20:41.031 --> 20:44.367
I'm a... I'm a lone wolf.

20:44.576 --> 20:48.537
A loner. Alone.

20:48.914 --> 20:53.542
All alone. Forever.

20:56.213 --> 21:00.091
What's a wolf gotta do
to get a hug around here?

21:08.100 --> 21:11.185
- That's it, just relax.
- Unh.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.062
Oh, oh!

21:13.272 --> 21:15.731
- Come on, more.
- Oh, God!

21:15.941 --> 21:18.526
You like that, don't you?

21:18.777 --> 21:23.281
- Yeah, right there.
- Want it there? Take it there, baby.

21:25.158 --> 21:29.120
- Phoebe?
- Yeah, say my name. Say it.

21:37.713 --> 21:41.007
And now I'm going
to cover you back up.

21:41.717 --> 21:47.263
And, um, I won't be speaking with you
for several weeks.
