02:45.458 --> 02:47.500
It's the sense of touch.

02:49.083 --> 02:50.333
What?

02:52.543 --> 02:56.334
Any real city, you walk, you know?

02:56.418 --> 03:00.167
You brush past people.
People bump into you.

03:00.375 --> 03:03.334
In L.A., nobody touches you.

03:06.084 --> 03:09.335
We're always behind
this metal and glass.

03:10.835 --> 03:13.710
I think we miss
that touch so much

03:13.835 --> 03:17.793
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

03:19.834 --> 03:22.002
You guys okay?

03:22.127 --> 03:24.168
I think he hit his head.

03:25.084 --> 03:27.044
You don't think that's true?

03:27.210 --> 03:29.084
Stay in your car.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.002
Graham, I think
we got rear-ended.

03:32.085 --> 03:34.170
I think we spun around twice.

03:34.252 --> 03:39.211
And somewhere in there,
one of us lost our frame of reference.

03:39.336 --> 03:41.710
And I'm gonna go look for it.

03:43.753 --> 03:46.545
- Calm down, ma'am.
- I am calm!

03:46.670 --> 03:48.753
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

03:48.878 --> 03:51.795
Why? It's not my fault!
It's her fault! She do this!

03:51.920 --> 03:52.670
My fault?

03:52.836 --> 03:54.712
Ma'am, you really need
to wait in your vehicle.

03:54.796 --> 03:55.712
My fault?

03:55.837 --> 03:58.296
Stop in middle of street!
Mexicans no know how to drive.

03:58.421 --> 04:00.379
She "blake" too fast.

04:00.504 --> 04:03.211
I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.

04:03.295 --> 04:06.337
- I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.
- Ma'am.

04:06.462 --> 04:09.879
See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

04:10.004 --> 04:12.963
Maybe you see over
steering wheel, you "blake" too!

04:13.047 --> 04:14.047
Ma'am!

04:14.172 --> 04:16.422
I call immigration on you.
Look what you do my car.

04:16.547 --> 04:20.254
Officer, can you please write in your report how
shocked I am to be hit by an Asian driver!

04:20.379 --> 04:23.463
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...

04:28.504 --> 04:31.879
All right. You've got to calm down.

04:39.505 --> 04:41.756
Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.

04:41.881 --> 04:43.588
Fuck you.

04:46.714 --> 04:48.632
Hey, you okay?

04:49.798 --> 04:51.006
I'm freezin'.

04:51.089 --> 04:53.882
Shit. I heard it might snow.

04:53.965 --> 04:56.256
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

04:56.381 --> 04:59.049
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.882
Yeah, me too.

05:02.007 --> 05:04.465
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

05:14.758 --> 05:16.050
Hey, Bob.

05:58.092 --> 06:00.927
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

06:13.761 --> 06:16.761
Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad
on your own time.

06:16.886 --> 06:19.469
What do you want?

06:22.261 --> 06:23.719
Are you making insult at me?

06:23.803 --> 06:26.718
Am I making insult "at" you?
Is that the closest you can come to English?

06:26.802 --> 06:29.761
- Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.
- Oh, God, here we go.

06:29.844 --> 06:32.218
I have right like you.
I have right to buy gun.

06:32.302 --> 06:34.428
Not in my store, you don't!
Andy, get him outta here now!

06:34.553 --> 06:36.719
- Go wait in the car.
- Now. Get out!

06:38.136 --> 06:39.719
You're an ignorant man!

06:39.844 --> 06:41.429
Yeah, I'm ignorant?
You're liberating my country.

06:41.595 --> 06:44.594
And I'm flying 747s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

06:44.761 --> 06:47.720
- Get the fuck out!
- No, you get the fuck out!

06:47.887 --> 06:49.511
No, don't touch me!
He cheat me!

06:49.636 --> 06:51.512
- Andy, now!
- Let's go.

06:51.637 --> 06:53.096
Okay.

06:56.679 --> 06:59.471
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

06:59.596 --> 07:03.638
And I am really hoping
for the money.

07:07.471 --> 07:10.013
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.097
We got a lot of kinds.

07:12.264 --> 07:14.638
We got long colts,
short colts, bull heads,

07:14.721 --> 07:17.264
flat nose, hollow points,
wide cutters,

07:17.389 --> 07:20.806
and a dozen more that'll fit
any size hole.

07:20.931 --> 07:24.681
Just depends upon how
much bang you can handle.

07:26.639 --> 07:28.972
I'll take the ones
in the red box.

07:32.264 --> 07:34.639
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

07:44.807 --> 07:48.931
Did you see any white people waitin' an hour
and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?

07:49.097 --> 07:50.515
And how many cups of coffee
did we get?

07:50.640 --> 07:53.557
You don't drink coffee
and I didn't want any.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.349
Man, that woman poured cup after cup
to every single white person around us.

07:57.474 --> 08:00.515
But did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

08:00.640 --> 08:02.599
We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want
and I didn't order,

08:02.683 --> 08:04.933
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

08:05.016 --> 08:07.016
Did you notice
that our waitress was black?

08:07.141 --> 08:09.600
And black women don't think
in stereotypes?

08:09.684 --> 08:12.141
You tell me.
When was the last time you met one

08:12.224 --> 08:14.475
who didn't think she knew
everything about your lazy ass

08:14.600 --> 08:16.474
before you even opened
your mouth, huh?

08:16.558 --> 08:18.809
That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.

08:18.975 --> 08:22.725
We're black, and black people don't tip.
She wasn't gonna waste her time.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.809
Somebody like that? Nothing you can do
to change their mind.

08:25.934 --> 08:28.350
How much did you leave?

08:28.475 --> 08:30.350
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

08:31.350 --> 08:34.850
What? What the fuck
is you laughin' at, man?

08:34.975 --> 08:37.975
I'm seriously starting to think
that you're jealous of Karen.

08:38.100 --> 08:42.308
Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through
a meal without calling her or anyone else.

08:42.392 --> 08:46.935
Okay, no more phone calls.
As a matter of fact, you can hold the battery.

08:47.018 --> 08:48.851
Okay?

08:50.350 --> 08:52.643
Ten bucks says
she calls you in the car.

08:52.810 --> 08:55.477
Wait, wait, wait.
See what that woman just did?

08:55.602 --> 08:57.518
- You see that?
- She's cold.

08:57.685 --> 09:00.977
She got colder
as soon as she saw us.

09:01.102 --> 09:04.226
- Ah, come on, don't start.
- Man, look around you, man.

09:04.351 --> 09:07.769
You couldn't find a whiter, safer
or better-lit part of this city right now.

09:07.894 --> 09:09.811
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

09:09.894 --> 09:12.603
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

09:12.687 --> 09:15.144
and her reaction
is blind fear?

09:15.227 --> 09:17.728
Look at us, dawg.
Are we dressed like gangbangers?

09:17.853 --> 09:21.187
Huh? No.
Do we look threatening? No.

09:21.270 --> 09:25.187
Fact. If anybody should be
scared around here, it's us!

09:25.312 --> 09:29.228
We're the only two black faces surrounded by
a sea of over-caffeinated white people

09:29.353 --> 09:32.062
patrolled by
the trigger-happy L. A. P. D.

09:32.187 --> 09:35.729
So you tell me.
Why aren't we scared?

09:35.854 --> 09:38.020
'Cause we got guns?

09:38.145 --> 09:40.020
You could be right.

09:43.020 --> 09:45.229
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Gimme the keys!

09:45.354 --> 09:48.062
- Hurry up! Get down!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

09:48.187 --> 09:52.396
- No, no! Please!
- Don't look at me! Turn around!

09:52.521 --> 09:56.021
- Come on! Go!
- We're fine! Just keep moving!

10:01.230 --> 10:05.688
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing
off of there right now.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.105
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

10:08.189 --> 10:10.064
Man's the patron saint
of travelers, dawg.

10:10.190 --> 10:13.022
You had a conversation
with God, huh? What did God say?

10:13.147 --> 10:17.647
"Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery
suction rings on every dashboard you find"?

10:17.730 --> 10:18.814
Why the hell do you do that?

10:18.939 --> 10:21.815
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

10:29.565 --> 10:32.066
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.856
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes
gets pissed, pulls a gun.

10:35.023 --> 10:37.690
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup
is a cop coming off shift.

10:37.815 --> 10:39.690
This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

10:39.773 --> 10:42.190
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

10:42.315 --> 10:44.190
I got the Mercedes.

10:45.065 --> 10:48.691
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

10:48.816 --> 10:52.357
Mercedes rolls to a stop. Driver opens the
door, falls out dead.

10:52.482 --> 10:55.274
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

10:55.399 --> 10:57.191
He says he kept tryin'
to drive away.

10:57.274 --> 10:59.357
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

10:59.441 --> 11:02.024
Shot back in self-defense.

11:02.149 --> 11:06.358
- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

11:06.483 --> 11:08.316
Find me a witness.

11:22.484 --> 11:25.233
That is a nice gun.

11:25.359 --> 11:29.902
The car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

11:30.027 --> 11:31.901
And that's not Cindy.

11:31.984 --> 11:34.777
That is a William Lewis.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.859
Found under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.

11:42.359 --> 11:46.276
Looks like Detective Conklin
shot himself the wrong nigger.

11:57.819 --> 12:00.944
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.

12:01.069 --> 12:02.027
Thank you.

12:11.735 --> 12:14.070
You don't think
reporters listen to police calls?

12:14.195 --> 12:15.987
I need to talk to you
for a second.

12:17.861 --> 12:20.321
You just give me a minute,
all right?

12:20.446 --> 12:23.278
- Find Flanagan, will you? Now.
- Yes, sir.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.112
Yes, honey?

12:26.237 --> 12:28.072
I want the locks changed
again in the morning.

12:28.154 --> 12:31.905
You want-- Why don't you just go lie down?
Have you checked on James?

12:31.988 --> 12:34.904
Of course. I've checked on him every five
minutes since we've been home.

12:35.029 --> 12:39.238
Do not patronize me. I want the locks
changed again in the morning.

12:40.071 --> 12:42.654
It's okay.
Just go to bed.

12:42.779 --> 12:46.237
You know, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

12:46.404 --> 12:50.447
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.
Is okay I go home now?

12:50.613 --> 12:52.071
It's fine. Thank you
very much for staying.

12:52.237 --> 12:53.863
You're welcome. No problem.
Good night.

12:53.947 --> 12:56.739
- Good night.
- We'll see you tomorrow.

12:56.822 --> 13:00.905
I would like the locks
changed again in the morning.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.363
And you might mention
that we'd appreciate it

13:03.447 --> 13:05.656
if next time they didn't send
a gang member.

13:05.781 --> 13:08.073
- A gang member? You mean that kid in there?
- Yes, yes.

13:08.156 --> 13:11.864
Yes. The guy with the shaved head,
the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

13:11.948 --> 13:13.198
- Those are not prison tattoos.
- Oh, really?

13:13.281 --> 13:15.614
And he's not gonna sell our key
to one of his gangbanger friends

13:15.698 --> 13:18.074
- the moment he is out our door?
- We've had a tough night.

13:18.199 --> 13:21.865
- It'd be best if you went upstairs...
- And wait for them to break in?

13:21.990 --> 13:25.449
I just had a gun pointed in my face.

13:25.573 --> 13:26.531
You lower your voice!

13:26.656 --> 13:29.532
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

13:29.615 --> 13:32.115
But if a white person sees two black men
walking towards her,

13:32.240 --> 13:35.783
and she turns and walks in the other direction,
she's a racist, right?

13:35.908 --> 13:38.490
Well, I got scared
and I didn't say anything.

13:38.615 --> 13:40.866
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

13:40.950 --> 13:45.157
I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna
sell our key to one of his homies.

13:45.282 --> 13:49.740
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

14:17.659 --> 14:19.867
All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

14:19.951 --> 14:21.910
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

14:21.993 --> 14:24.410
I'm the goddamn
District Attorney of Los Angeles.

14:24.535 --> 14:27.702
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

14:27.827 --> 14:29.617
Fuck!

14:30.827 --> 14:33.118
Why did these guys
have to be black?

14:33.203 --> 14:34.868
I mean, why?

14:34.993 --> 14:36.619
No matter how we spin this,

14:36.744 --> 14:39.786
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

14:39.911 --> 14:43.453
You're worrying too much. You have
a lot of support in the black community.

14:45.161 --> 14:47.702
All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

14:47.827 --> 14:52.368
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

14:52.493 --> 14:54.285
Bruce?

14:55.578 --> 14:57.203
The firefighter.

14:57.328 --> 15:00.286
The one who saved the camp or something.
Northridge. What's his name?

15:00.369 --> 15:01.495
He's Iraqi.

15:02.495 --> 15:05.703
He's Iraqi?
Well, he looks black.

15:05.828 --> 15:09.619
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

15:09.703 --> 15:12.704
Saddam?
His-His name's Saddam?

15:12.829 --> 15:16.912
That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

15:16.995 --> 15:19.204
Give yourself a raise, will you?

15:22.204 --> 15:24.955
It's been good
doing business with you.

15:25.830 --> 15:29.163
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

15:29.288 --> 15:32.913
Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

15:33.038 --> 15:35.914
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

15:35.997 --> 15:39.914
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic
three times in the last month.

15:39.997 --> 15:45.331
He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.
That is by no means an emergency.

15:45.414 --> 15:48.539
Now if you have any more questions
about your HMO plan, why don't you

15:48.824 --> 15:52.366
make an appointment to come in between
10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.

15:52.991 --> 15:54.990
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

15:55.115 --> 15:56.906
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.824
- I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor!

15:59.949 --> 16:01.824
- What is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

16:01.949 --> 16:04.658
Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.

16:20.950 --> 16:23.326
Bronson Avenue, WestWood.

16:23.409 --> 16:26.118
Vehicle is described as a black
late-model Lincoln Navigator.

16:26.201 --> 16:30.743
California plate
4 Peter Charles Ida 315.

16:30.868 --> 16:34.284
Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.

16:42.702 --> 16:43.702
That's not it.

16:44.952 --> 16:46.868
That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.

16:46.993 --> 16:50.702
The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car
and takes it to Studio City.

16:55.785 --> 16:58.076
They were doin' something.

17:42.372 --> 17:43.747
Enthusiastic.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.122
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, please.

17:47.247 --> 17:51.497
I'm gonna need to see
your driver's license and registration.

17:51.580 --> 17:53.747
No problem.

17:53.872 --> 17:57.705
I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove
compartment to get the registration.

17:57.830 --> 18:00.205
- Is that okay?
- Nice and slow, please.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.662
Okay.

18:05.788 --> 18:07.997
How are you tonight, Officer?

18:08.080 --> 18:09.998
Excellent.

18:11.789 --> 18:13.538
Here you go.

18:16.831 --> 18:18.873
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

18:28.290 --> 18:30.373
Let's do it again right now.

18:31.207 --> 18:33.207
Step outta the car, please, sir.

18:33.332 --> 18:37.040
Wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

18:37.124 --> 18:39.374
Then we shouldn't have a problem.

18:39.457 --> 18:42.040
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

18:42.165 --> 18:44.083
No, it's okay.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.666
It's fine.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.707
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.541
That's good. Right there.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.791
Look at me.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.625
I want you to stand
on your right foot.

19:02.750 --> 19:06.875
Touch your nose
with the index finger of your left hand.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.292
I told you he doesn't drink.

19:13.417 --> 19:16.583
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you
one time to stay in the vehicle.

19:16.708 --> 19:19.292
- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

19:19.417 --> 19:22.751
Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

19:22.876 --> 19:26.043
Look, Officer, my wife
has had a couple of drinks--

19:26.210 --> 19:29.167
Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on
top of your head and interlock your fingers.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.085
Wait.
We're only a block away from our house.

19:31.168 --> 19:33.584
Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.710
- Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
- I'm a television director.

19:36.835 --> 19:39.585
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

19:39.710 --> 19:42.043
Take your hands off him.
He's done nothing wrong.

19:42.127 --> 19:44.211
Put your hands on top
of your head, ma'am.

19:44.336 --> 19:45.835
- Do what he says.
- Fuck you!

19:45.918 --> 19:46.919
Put your hands...

19:47.003 --> 19:49.795
And you keep
your filthy fucking hands off me!

19:49.920 --> 19:51.544
You motherfucking pig!

19:51.628 --> 19:55.169
- Just stop talking!
- That's quite a mouth you have.

19:55.253 --> 19:57.003
Of course you know that.

19:57.128 --> 20:00.919
Fuck you! That's what
this is all about, isn't it?

20:01.044 --> 20:03.836
You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a
black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.

20:03.919 --> 20:05.669
Will you just shut
your fucking mouth!

20:05.794 --> 20:08.836
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

20:08.961 --> 20:11.253
Put your legs open.

20:13.004 --> 20:17.462
Do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

20:17.587 --> 20:20.044
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

20:20.169 --> 20:22.295
You'd be surprised some of the places
I've found weapons.

20:22.420 --> 20:23.295
He's clean.

20:24.837 --> 20:28.713
What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

20:29.588 --> 20:32.920
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

20:33.045 --> 20:35.171
while you were operating
a motor vehicle.

20:35.296 --> 20:39.421
That's reckless endangerment,
which incidentally is a felony.

20:41.422 --> 20:46.006
We could charge your wife with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

20:48.255 --> 20:50.964
You say you're a block from home.

20:51.089 --> 20:53.464
We could use our discretion

20:53.547 --> 20:55.589
and let you go with a warning,

20:56.506 --> 20:58.965
or we could cuff you and put you
in the back of the car.

21:01.714 --> 21:04.632
What do you think
we should do, sir?

21:12.131 --> 21:15.382
Look, we're sorry, and

21:15.465 --> 21:21.007
we would appreciate if you would just
let us go with a warning, please.

21:25.632 --> 21:28.298
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

21:28.423 --> 21:31.508
I think we can let him go.
Don't you?

21:34.215 --> 21:35.757
Yeah.

21:35.883 --> 21:38.133
All right.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.799
You can go.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.634
You folks
drive safe now, huh?

22:26.843 --> 22:29.177
Let's go, Tommy.

22:37.343 --> 22:39.219
It won't close.

22:40.552 --> 22:41.511
I can do that.

22:41.636 --> 22:43.511
Dad, you couldn't even get it open.

22:43.636 --> 22:45.595
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun!

22:47.428 --> 22:50.052
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

22:50.177 --> 22:52.970
Dorri, that man
could've killed your mother.

22:53.053 --> 22:56.428
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

22:56.512 --> 22:58.013
Farhad, it won't close.

23:02.637 --> 23:05.054
Dorri, you should be at work.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.595
Who are you calling?

23:18.720 --> 23:21.304
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

23:21.471 --> 23:25.429
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

23:25.554 --> 23:29.888
Do you have any idea how that felt?
To have that pig's hands all over me?

23:30.013 --> 23:31.847
And you just stood there!

23:33.847 --> 23:35.639
And then you apologized to him?

23:35.722 --> 23:38.639
What did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

23:38.722 --> 23:42.180
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.

23:42.264 --> 23:46.014
Well, maybe you would've been satisfied
with just being arrested.

23:46.139 --> 23:50.015
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

23:50.140 --> 23:52.889
than get your name in the paper.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.140
You finally got me
figured out, 'cause see,

23:55.265 --> 23:58.015
that's exactly
what I was worried about right there.

23:58.140 --> 24:01.182
Oh? You weren't afraid that
all your good friends at the studio

24:01.307 --> 24:05.181
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize he's actually black?

24:06.807 --> 24:08.806
You need to calm down right now.

24:08.931 --> 24:13.766
What I need is a husband who will not just
stand there while I am being molested!

24:13.891 --> 24:16.848
They were cops for God sakes!
They had guns!

24:18.515 --> 24:21.223
Maybe I should've let them
arrest your ass.

24:21.348 --> 24:25.058
Sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

24:26.099 --> 24:27.974
Fuck you, man.
Like you know.

24:28.057 --> 24:31.766
The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.

24:31.891 --> 24:34.975
At least I wasn't watching it
with the rest of the equestrian team.

24:35.058 --> 24:37.224
You're right, Cameron.
I got a lot to learn

24:37.349 --> 24:40.433
'cause I haven't quite learned
how to shuck and jive.

24:40.558 --> 24:43.391
Let me hear it again.
Thank you, mister policeman.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.225
You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

24:46.350 --> 24:50.851
You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.

24:52.393 --> 24:55.308
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

24:56.434 --> 24:57.643
You know, fuck you!

24:59.769 --> 25:03.352
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

25:53.187 --> 25:54.229
How's it goin'?

25:54.354 --> 25:56.021
Okay.

25:56.104 --> 25:58.228
You didn't get scared
or something, did you?

25:58.353 --> 26:01.104
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

26:01.229 --> 26:04.187
There's no such thing
as monsters.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.313
Ah, that's a good thing.

26:06.438 --> 26:07.897
I heard a bang.

26:08.022 --> 26:09.604
Like a truck bang?

26:09.771 --> 26:11.813
Like a gun.

26:19.105 --> 26:22.896
That's funny, 'cause we moved
outta that bad neighborhood.

26:23.021 --> 26:25.813
And there's not
too many guns around here.

26:27.230 --> 26:29.563
How far can bullets go?

26:29.688 --> 26:31.648
They go pretty far.

26:31.773 --> 26:34.563
But they usually get stuck
in something and stop.

26:34.647 --> 26:36.313
What if they don't?

26:36.438 --> 26:40.189
You thinking about that bullet
that came through your window?

26:42.899 --> 26:44.939
You think we should move again?

26:45.106 --> 26:46.481
I like it here.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.564
Me too. But if that bullet
found out where we lived...

26:50.231 --> 26:51.231
Oh, hold on.

26:51.314 --> 26:52.815
What?

26:52.940 --> 26:54.939
So stupid!
How can I forget this?

26:56.357 --> 26:57.315
What?

26:59.524 --> 27:01.189
Nah. Forget it.
You ain't gonna believe me.

27:01.273 --> 27:02.857
Tell me.

27:03.732 --> 27:06.150
Okay.

27:06.275 --> 27:09.900
When I was five, this fairy
came into my room one night.

27:10.025 --> 27:12.649
- Right.
- See, I told you you weren't gonna believe me.

27:12.774 --> 27:15.233
- Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
- No, tell me.

27:17.358 --> 27:19.607
Okay.

27:19.732 --> 27:24.982
So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like,
"Yeah, right, you're a fairy."

27:25.107 --> 27:27.108
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

27:27.233 --> 27:30.316
And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

27:30.441 --> 27:32.775
She was flying?

27:32.901 --> 27:35.525
She had these little stubby wings.
She could've glued 'em on, you know?

27:35.608 --> 27:38.233
Like I'm gonna believe
she's a fairy.

27:38.358 --> 27:40.317
So she said, "I'll prove it."

27:40.442 --> 27:43.026
So she reaches
into her backpack.

27:43.151 --> 27:45.402
And she pulls out
this invisible cloak.

27:45.527 --> 27:50.067
She ties it around my neck, and she tells me
that it's impenetrable.

27:50.234 --> 27:52.442
You know what
impenetrable means?

27:52.567 --> 27:54.359
It means that nothing
can go through it.

27:54.484 --> 27:56.735
No bullets. Nothing.

27:56.818 --> 28:00.693
She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.

28:00.818 --> 28:05.735
So I did. And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed.

28:05.860 --> 28:08.819
Nothing.
I mean, how weird is that?

28:08.903 --> 28:12.861
Only she told me that I was supposed to give it
to my daughter on her fifth birthday.

28:12.986 --> 28:14.736
And I forgot.

28:14.819 --> 28:16.318
Can I touch it?

28:16.485 --> 28:18.486
Sure, go ahead.

28:20.903 --> 28:23.903
- I don't feel it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

28:24.028 --> 28:27.902
I can take it off and tie it around your
shoulders. She told me how to do it.

28:27.985 --> 28:31.611
- Unless you think it's stupid.
- Don't you need it?

28:31.736 --> 28:34.528
No, not anymore.

28:34.653 --> 28:37.570
So what do you think?
You want it?

28:43.820 --> 28:45.570
Okay, let's get outta here.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.279
Okay.

29:06.238 --> 29:08.905
Put your head up.

29:13.864 --> 29:16.572
Okay. Is that too tight?

29:16.656 --> 29:19.155
Do you feel anything at all?

29:19.238 --> 29:21.656
Good. Then it's just right.

29:27.947 --> 29:30.405
Do I take it off
when I have a bath?

29:30.530 --> 29:33.322
No, you leave it on
all the time.

29:33.406 --> 29:38.782
Until you have a daughter when she turns five,
then you give it to her.

29:38.865 --> 29:40.157
Okay?

29:41.032 --> 29:41.989
Okay.

29:44.448 --> 29:47.865
Okay. Good night, sweetie.

29:49.073 --> 29:51.616
Good night.

30:30.909 --> 30:34.324
Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

30:35.242 --> 30:38.493
How in the lunacy of your mind
is hip-hop music of the oppressor?

30:38.576 --> 30:41.826
Listen to it, man!
"Nigger this, nigger that."

30:41.951 --> 30:45.409
You think white people go around calling
each other honkies all day, man?

30:45.534 --> 30:46.950
"Hey, honky, how's business?"'

30:47.035 --> 30:49.035
"Going great, cracker.
We're diversifying."

30:49.118 --> 30:53.911
How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?
Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.

30:54.036 --> 30:55.744
And you think
there's a difference, don't you? Huh?

30:55.869 --> 30:59.952
Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a nigger

31:00.036 --> 31:03.244
You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop
music comes from, do you?

31:03.369 --> 31:05.912
I'd shoot 'em dead first
but I done broke my trigger

31:06.037 --> 31:08.286
See, back in the '60s we had
smart, articulate black men.

31:08.411 --> 31:10.702
Gonna get out my sheet
Put my hood on my head

31:10.827 --> 31:13.702
Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.

31:13.827 --> 31:15.203
Gonna string 'em up good

31:15.287 --> 31:17.078
These brothers were speaking out,
and people were listening!

31:17.203 --> 31:18.871
Then they'll be dead

31:18.995 --> 31:20.995
Then the FBI said,
"No, we can't have that."

31:21.078 --> 31:23.870
Home of the brave
and the land of the free

31:23.995 --> 31:26.037
"Let's give the niggers
this music by a bunch of mumbling idiots

31:26.162 --> 31:28.870
and sooner or later,
they'll all copy it, and nobody

31:28.995 --> 31:30.995
will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

31:31.078 --> 31:33.245
End of problem."

31:40.203 --> 31:41.538
What the fuck was that, dawg?

31:55.871 --> 31:58.080
- Holy shit!
- What?

31:58.205 --> 31:59.746
Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.

32:00.996 --> 32:02.705
You're sayin' there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

32:02.830 --> 32:03.914
What part don't you understand?

32:04.039 --> 32:06.872
There's a Chinaman stuck
underneath the fucking truck.

32:09.290 --> 32:10.248
Help me.

32:10.415 --> 32:13.039
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

32:13.205 --> 32:16.872
Ah, God. What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

32:17.747 --> 32:20.040
Man! This is so
completely fucked up.

32:20.123 --> 32:21.999
Oh, really? No shit!

32:22.082 --> 32:25.165
Okay, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

32:25.248 --> 32:27.249
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

32:27.332 --> 32:29.540
- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

32:29.623 --> 32:32.498
No, we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

32:32.581 --> 32:34.290
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.

32:34.415 --> 32:37.498
You know why? Because he's stuck
underneath the fucking truck!

32:37.581 --> 32:42.831
Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've
considered that option half a block back.

32:42.916 --> 32:46.374
What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

32:46.541 --> 32:48.124
You grab his arm,
it's gonna fall off.

32:48.249 --> 32:51.040
Then you gonna be standing in the street
holding a Chinaman's arm.

32:51.123 --> 32:53.041
Then what your ass gonna do, huh?

32:53.957 --> 32:57.499
If we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

32:58.499 --> 33:01.542
Just grab his arm.
We'll just pull him out.

33:06.750 --> 33:10.042
I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant.
I just want a new partner.

33:10.125 --> 33:12.209
I understand.
Your partner's a racist prick.

33:12.293 --> 33:14.750
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

33:14.833 --> 33:16.625
He's been on the force for a long time.

33:16.750 --> 33:18.876
Seventeen years.

33:19.043 --> 33:21.209
And I do have to work here, sir.

33:21.376 --> 33:23.752
So you don't mind
that there's a racist prick on the force.

33:23.877 --> 33:26.834
You just don't want him
to ride in your car.

33:26.918 --> 33:29.751
If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.

33:29.835 --> 33:31.626
That'd be great.
Write a full report.

33:31.751 --> 33:34.543
Because I'm anxious to
understand how an obvious bigot

33:34.626 --> 33:37.584
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years.

33:37.668 --> 33:39.834
Eleven of which he was under
my personal supervision.

33:39.959 --> 33:42.334
Which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

33:42.419 --> 33:46.127
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

33:46.252 --> 33:50.127
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

33:50.252 --> 33:53.502
So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,
you just don't like him.

33:53.627 --> 33:56.502
- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

33:56.627 --> 33:59.503
Then I guess I should think of a better one
and get back to you.

33:59.628 --> 34:02.545
So you think I'm asking you
to make one up.

34:02.628 --> 34:07.420
Uh, no, sir. I just can't
think of one... right now.

34:07.503 --> 34:09.585
You wanna know what I heard?

34:11.045 --> 34:13.085
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

34:13.210 --> 34:15.337
You want me to say
he has flatulence?

34:15.462 --> 34:18.210
Not him. You.
You have uncontrollable flatulence.

34:18.295 --> 34:21.754
You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody
else so you're requesting a one-man car.

34:21.879 --> 34:24.795
I'm not... comfortable with that,
Lieutenant.

34:24.962 --> 34:27.838
I wouldn't be either. Which is why
I understand your need for privacy.

34:27.963 --> 34:31.712
Just like I'm sure you understand how hard
a black man has to work to get to,

34:31.795 --> 34:34.920
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the L.A. P D.

34:35.045 --> 34:38.087
and how easily
that can be taken away.

34:38.170 --> 34:41.254
Now, that being said,
it's your decision.

34:41.379 --> 34:46.170
You can put your career and mine on the line
in pursuit of a just cause,

34:46.295 --> 34:50.172
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

34:50.297 --> 34:52.588
of a personal nature.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.838
Fuck.

35:28.215 --> 35:29.175
Excuse me.

35:30.591 --> 35:33.132
Excuse me. Sir?

35:33.299 --> 35:34.507
You finished?

35:34.674 --> 35:38.424
I replaced the lock.
But you got a real problem with that door.

35:38.507 --> 35:40.965
You fix the lock?

35:41.132 --> 35:45.257
Nah, I replaced the lock.
But you gotta fix that door.

35:45.340 --> 35:48.757
- Just fix the lock!
- Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.

35:48.840 --> 35:52.008
What you need
is a new door.

35:52.133 --> 35:54.550
- I need new door?
- Yeah.

35:54.675 --> 35:57.133
Okay. How much?

35:57.216 --> 36:01.175
I don't-- Sir, you're gonna have to call
somebody that sells doors.

36:01.258 --> 36:05.342
You try to cheat me, right?
You have a friend that fix door?

36:05.509 --> 36:07.634
Nah, I don't have a friend
that fix doors, bro.

36:07.759 --> 36:10.092
Then go and fix the fucking lock,
you cheater.

36:10.176 --> 36:12.967
You-- You know what?

36:13.051 --> 36:16.510
Why don't you just pay for the lock
and I won't charge you for the time.

36:16.635 --> 36:19.010
You don't fix the lock!
I pay! You think I'm stupid?

36:19.135 --> 36:22.302
You fix the fucking lock,
you cheater!

36:22.385 --> 36:24.884
- I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.
- Then fix the fucking lock!

36:25.009 --> 36:28.428
I replaced the lock!
You gotta fix the fucking door!

36:28.511 --> 36:31.761
You cheat!
You fucking cheater!

36:31.844 --> 36:34.553
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

36:34.677 --> 36:37.385
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

36:37.510 --> 36:40.510
Wait! You come back here!
You fix the lock!

36:40.635 --> 36:42.760
Come here! You fix my lock!

36:42.885 --> 36:44.386
Fix the fucking lock!

36:50.594 --> 36:54.553
I understand. You run over a Chinaman.
Stuff him in the back.

36:54.678 --> 36:57.512
Then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

36:57.636 --> 37:00.469
Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

37:00.553 --> 37:02.845
- Georgie, burn this thing.
- Burn it?

37:02.970 --> 37:05.178
It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

37:05.303 --> 37:07.304
You watch the Discovery Channel?

37:07.387 --> 37:10.804
- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.

37:10.929 --> 37:14.470
Every night there is a show
with somebody shining a blue light

37:14.637 --> 37:18.846
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

37:18.930 --> 37:23.471
bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic
Burger King tray cups.

37:23.555 --> 37:27.054
The next thing they show is some stupid
redneck in handcuffs

37:27.179 --> 37:31.347
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

37:31.472 --> 37:34.472
Sometimes the redneck is actually watching
the Discovery Channel

37:34.597 --> 37:36.597
when they break in to arrest him.

37:36.722 --> 37:41.931
And he still can't figure out how on earth
they could've caught him!

37:49.888 --> 37:53.764
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

37:53.889 --> 37:55.055
No.

37:55.180 --> 37:57.722
Then get the fuck
outta my shop.

38:00.223 --> 38:02.347
Oh, yeah, make sure
you get that.

38:02.472 --> 38:05.848
Without him, things could've gone really
fucking wrong tonight.

38:07.972 --> 38:11.724
- Fuck!
- Don't! Don't you dare.

38:11.849 --> 38:13.682
Don't.

38:13.807 --> 38:16.890
Graham Waters.

38:17.057 --> 38:21.266
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

38:22.724 --> 38:25.724
I'm not gonna go looking for him.

38:25.849 --> 38:29.141
Look, he'll be home when--
Just leave it alone.

38:29.224 --> 38:33.892
Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

38:34.017 --> 38:36.433
Okay, where were we?

38:36.558 --> 38:39.017
I was white, and you were
about to jerk off in the shower.

38:39.100 --> 38:41.974
Oh, shit!

38:42.058 --> 38:44.142
Come on.

38:44.225 --> 38:49.183
I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't
think it would've pissed her off as much.

38:49.309 --> 38:51.600
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

38:51.725 --> 38:55.349
- What, you start to feel something and panic?
- Come on, Maria.

38:55.517 --> 38:58.934
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

38:59.059 --> 39:01.392
That's just where
I begin to get pissed.

39:01.517 --> 39:04.850
I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way?

39:04.934 --> 39:09.018
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

39:09.101 --> 39:12.060
If I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.518
Okay. I was raised badly.

39:15.601 --> 39:19.060
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back into bed and teach me a lesson?

39:19.143 --> 39:23.101
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
How 'bout a geography lesson?

39:23.226 --> 39:27.352
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

39:27.477 --> 39:30.519
Neither one of those is Mexico.

39:30.644 --> 39:33.060
Ah. Then I guess the big mystery is

39:33.186 --> 39:36.645
who gathered all those
remarkably different cultures together

39:36.770 --> 39:39.812
and taught them all how
to park their cars on their lawns?

40:07.603 --> 40:09.937
Pop, you okay?

40:10.062 --> 40:13.062
If I could piss, I'd be okay.

40:14.604 --> 40:17.355
I'm-- Jesus.

40:17.439 --> 40:19.938
I'm done now.

40:20.063 --> 40:22.063
Give me a hand.

40:24.604 --> 40:26.522
Wait a goddamn minute!

40:26.605 --> 40:29.272
- Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:31.272 --> 40:34.730
All right. Okay. Okay.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.731
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

40:44.815 --> 40:47.480
- I gotta go back.
- Okay.

40:59.772 --> 41:02.856
What, are you gonna
stand there and stare at me?

42:11.777 --> 42:14.401
- So Conklin just shot him?
- Mm-hmm.

42:14.526 --> 42:16.194
- They know each other?
- Sir.

42:16.319 --> 42:17.444
It's a grudge thing?

42:17.569 --> 42:19.485
Not as far as we can tell.

42:20.819 --> 42:22.611
You think this is
racially motivated?

42:22.695 --> 42:26.027
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

42:26.152 --> 42:28.110
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

42:28.194 --> 42:32.195
Waters. All right. Well, tell him
he speaks to no one but me.

42:32.320 --> 42:35.446
Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

42:35.571 --> 42:37.486
And would someone
please find Flanagan.

42:39.486 --> 42:41.112
Oh! What up, Mo Phat?

42:42.820 --> 42:47.154
Man robs purses from old ladies and you,
"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"'

42:47.280 --> 42:50.279
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

42:50.404 --> 42:52.904
You callin' him a thief?
And we do what?

42:53.029 --> 42:54.946
The man steals
from black people.

42:55.029 --> 42:59.278
Only reason black people steal from their own
is 'cause they terrified of white people.

42:59.361 --> 43:00.654
Oh, man, please.

43:00.737 --> 43:04.112
Think about it. Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.

43:04.196 --> 43:06.779
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

43:06.862 --> 43:09.280
Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks
in Toluca Lake,

43:09.363 --> 43:13.488
that nigger will run like a rabbit soon
as somebody say "decaf latte."

43:13.613 --> 43:16.821
What the fuck did you do to my car?

43:24.238 --> 43:27.656
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

43:27.781 --> 43:30.738
I turn key to my car, but nothing.

43:30.863 --> 43:32.781
James wanted to take this to school.

43:32.864 --> 43:35.573
But I don't want the kids to fight over it.

43:35.698 --> 43:39.407
- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean, senora!

43:39.531 --> 43:44.407
You know, Maria, just once I would like to
wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.

43:45.739 --> 43:48.324
Si, senora.
No problem.

43:49.866 --> 43:51.657
I'm startin' to understand now.

43:51.782 --> 43:54.657
By your work, you're settin' an example
for our neighborhood.

43:54.782 --> 43:57.240
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

43:58.282 --> 43:59.740
Yeah, you laugh, man.

43:59.865 --> 44:03.990
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

44:06.032 --> 44:08.157
What the hell do you think
you doin' right now, man?

44:08.281 --> 44:09.740
Wavin' down the bus.

44:09.865 --> 44:12.325
Put your hand down, dawg!
Are you outta your mind?

44:12.450 --> 44:14.865
You actually expect me
to get on a bus?

44:14.950 --> 44:17.200
No. I was hopin' we could
push your car across town.

44:17.325 --> 44:19.241
You know why? 'Cause we just don't
do stuff like that no more.

44:19.366 --> 44:21.991
You have no idea, do you?

44:22.075 --> 44:25.575
You have no idea why they put them great big
windows on the sides of buses, do you?

44:25.700 --> 44:28.201
- Why?
- One reason only.

44:28.367 --> 44:32.700
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.

44:32.783 --> 44:34.159
I didn't know that.

44:34.242 --> 44:37.201
You could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

44:37.326 --> 44:39.284
You know the Kings
are playin' tonight.

44:39.367 --> 44:42.742
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

44:42.867 --> 44:45.159
I love hockey.

44:45.242 --> 44:46.827
Cut! Print. Moving on.

44:46.910 --> 44:48.035
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

44:48.118 --> 44:49.493
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

44:51.202 --> 44:54.243
Jamal, that's what
I'm talking about.

44:54.368 --> 44:55.702
Right on.

44:57.618 --> 45:01.035
- Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.910
Yeah. Listen. I think
we need another take, buddy.

45:04.035 --> 45:06.743
That looked
pretty terrific, man.

45:06.868 --> 45:11.035
This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

45:11.118 --> 45:13.035
What do you mean?

45:13.160 --> 45:16.619
Have you noticed, uh--
This is weird for a white guy to say,

45:16.703 --> 45:20.494
but have you noticed
he's talking a lot less black lately?

45:22.578 --> 45:24.036
No, I haven't noticed that.

45:24.161 --> 45:28.162
Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed to
say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."

45:28.245 --> 45:30.579
And he changed it to,
"Don't talk to me about that."

45:30.745 --> 45:31.995
Wait a minute.

45:32.120 --> 45:36.662
You think because of that, the audience
won't recognize him as being a black man?

45:36.787 --> 45:37.745
Come on!

45:37.912 --> 45:39.955
Is there a problem, Cam?

45:40.079 --> 45:41.704
Excuse me?

45:41.787 --> 45:44.080
Is there a problem, Cam?

45:48.996 --> 45:51.537
No, we don't have a problem.

45:51.620 --> 45:54.830
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying
is it's not his character.

45:54.913 --> 45:57.538
Eddie's supposed to be
the smart one, not Jamal, right?

45:57.621 --> 46:01.414
You're the expert here.
But to me, it rings false.

46:04.788 --> 46:08.581
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.

46:08.706 --> 46:12.621
Everybody back.
Let's do it one more time.

46:15.163 --> 46:17.247
Jamal, um...

46:21.456 --> 46:23.081
Morning, Carol.
Who do I have?

46:23.206 --> 46:24.539
Hold for a minute, please.

46:24.622 --> 46:28.831
Mr. Trujillo called and canceled,
but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.

46:32.081 --> 46:34.790
Send him in.

46:34.915 --> 46:37.207
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

46:37.290 --> 46:39.457
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

46:39.582 --> 46:42.166
I believe we spoke last night.

46:42.291 --> 46:45.749
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to apologize about that.

46:45.874 --> 46:48.874
I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

46:48.957 --> 46:51.458
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

46:51.583 --> 46:55.666
This doctor he's been seein'
says he's got a urinary tract infection.

46:55.749 --> 46:59.250
But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,
and he keeps gettin' worse.

46:59.375 --> 47:01.374
And he's been back to see
Dr. Robertson?

47:01.499 --> 47:04.209
Yeah. Between you and me,
the man's an idiot.

47:04.292 --> 47:06.249
- Really?
- No offense.

47:06.333 --> 47:09.749
But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
I think his nurses are doing most of the work.

47:09.874 --> 47:14.916
Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's welcome
to see a doctor outside the network.

47:15.083 --> 47:19.499
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

47:19.583 --> 47:22.750
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

47:22.835 --> 47:26.417
- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes--
- What good is that gonna do?

47:26.542 --> 47:29.250
I'm sorry.
There's nothing else I can do.

47:29.334 --> 47:31.709
All right.
You know what I can't do?

47:33.001 --> 47:35.585
I can't look at you without
thinking about the five or six

47:35.710 --> 47:38.085
more qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

47:38.168 --> 47:39.918
It's time for you to go.

47:40.001 --> 47:43.126
I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping
that I'm wrong about you.

47:43.251 --> 47:44.877
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

47:45.002 --> 47:47.251
someone who may have been
given a helping hand,

47:47.376 --> 47:50.127
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

47:50.252 --> 47:52.293
Carol, I need security in my office!

47:52.460 --> 47:55.461
You don't like me, that's fine.
I'm a prick.

47:55.586 --> 47:58.127
My father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

47:58.252 --> 48:00.252
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

48:00.378 --> 48:02.212
Saved enough to start
his own company.

48:02.295 --> 48:04.294
Twenty-three employees,
all of them black.

48:04.377 --> 48:07.087
Paid 'em equal wages
when no one else was doing that.

48:07.170 --> 48:12.044
For 30 years he worked side by side with
those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.

48:12.127 --> 48:14.003
Then the city council decides to give

48:14.128 --> 48:17.377
minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

48:17.502 --> 48:20.253
And overnight,
my father loses everything.

48:20.378 --> 48:23.795
His business, his home, his wife.
Everything!

48:23.878 --> 48:27.545
Not once does he blame your people.

48:27.628 --> 48:31.128
I'm not asking you to help me.

48:31.253 --> 48:35.588
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

48:35.671 --> 48:38.004
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

48:38.129 --> 48:40.421
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you?

48:40.504 --> 48:42.463
Nothing.

48:42.546 --> 48:44.463
Just a flick of your pen.

48:46.046 --> 48:48.964
Your father sounds
like a good man.

48:49.089 --> 48:53.214
And if he'd come in here today, I probably
would've approved this request.

48:53.339 --> 48:57.755
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.

48:57.839 --> 49:00.798
Get him the hell outta my office.

49:04.923 --> 49:07.797
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

49:07.922 --> 49:12.547
Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you
you needed to replace or repair the door.

49:12.672 --> 49:14.297
He say he fix the lock.

49:14.422 --> 49:17.006
- You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!
- You're yelling again.

49:17.131 --> 49:19.005
I am not yelling! I'm upset!

49:19.130 --> 49:21.464
Yes-- Yes, I am.

49:21.589 --> 49:23.215
Mom, are you all right?

49:23.340 --> 49:27.590
Stop washing.
Insurance must take picture.

49:27.715 --> 49:29.174
Okay?

49:30.590 --> 49:32.965
Look what they wrote.

49:33.048 --> 49:35.007
They think we're Arab.

49:35.174 --> 49:37.215
When did Persian become Arab?

49:37.340 --> 49:40.132
I want his name. Yes.

49:40.257 --> 49:41.841
Oh, my God.

49:41.966 --> 49:45.007
- I want his name! Give me his name!
- Dad?

49:45.132 --> 49:46.466
I'm not giving you his name, sir.

49:46.591 --> 49:50.383
- Dad, did they take the gun?
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!

49:50.508 --> 49:52.508
I'm gonna hang up now, sir.

49:52.632 --> 49:56.383
Don't hang up! Shit!

49:56.508 --> 49:58.300
Oh, thank God.

50:44.220 --> 50:45.510
Mom?

50:47.260 --> 50:49.511
Mom, it's cold. Come on.

51:11.721 --> 51:14.011
Did you find your brother?

51:16.179 --> 51:18.304
No, Mom.

51:27.762 --> 51:30.304
I was doin' good.

51:31.596 --> 51:35.055
I was-- I was doin' real good.

51:36.887 --> 51:39.179
- I know, Mom.
- I was doin'...

51:44.097 --> 51:46.056
It's okay.

51:57.389 --> 51:59.556
Did you find your brother?

52:01.889 --> 52:04.306
No, Mom.

52:05.639 --> 52:08.182
Tell him to come home.

52:09.557 --> 52:14.849
Tell him I'm not mad, okay?
Okay, baby?

52:14.974 --> 52:17.515
Okay, Mom.

52:17.682 --> 52:20.140
Okay, baby.

52:20.265 --> 52:21.848
Okay.

52:22.889 --> 52:24.932
Okay.

53:00.517 --> 53:03.434
- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

53:05.434 --> 53:09.059
Internal Affairs called.
Found something in the Mercedes.

53:11.810 --> 53:14.060
That's lunch. One hour.

53:43.227 --> 53:45.061
I tried to call.

53:45.144 --> 53:47.269
Sounded like you're havin'
a bad day, huh?

53:47.394 --> 53:48.686
Yeah.

53:53.187 --> 53:54.978
What?

53:55.978 --> 53:57.937
I got scared, Cam.

53:58.062 --> 54:03.520
It's not like I haven't been
pulled over before. You know?

54:03.605 --> 54:05.604
But not like that.

54:06.937 --> 54:08.937
And, yes, I was a little drunk.

54:09.062 --> 54:12.980
And I was mouthing off.

54:13.105 --> 54:15.271
I'm sorry.

54:17.438 --> 54:19.146
But when that man was
putting his hands on me...

54:19.271 --> 54:20.938
I don't wanna talk about it.

54:21.063 --> 54:24.396
I can't believe
you let him do that, baby.

54:25.771 --> 54:29.355
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

54:30.938 --> 54:33.605
But I was humiliated!

54:33.730 --> 54:35.896
For you.

54:35.980 --> 54:40.438
I just couldn't stand to see
that man take away your dignity.

54:40.563 --> 54:43.564
Yeah. That's what happened.

54:43.689 --> 54:46.730
- Oh, baby, don't do this.
- No. No, you're right.

54:46.813 --> 54:48.606
I ain't doin' it.

54:48.689 --> 54:51.231
You gonna walk away from me?

54:51.314 --> 54:54.482
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

55:00.523 --> 55:01.857
Mm-hmm.

55:03.398 --> 55:04.357
I understand.

55:06.441 --> 55:07.649
Thanks.

55:11.023 --> 55:14.440
- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.

55:18.274 --> 55:20.524
Mr. Golzari, you said
you called the locksmith?

55:22.358 --> 55:23.524
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

55:24.483 --> 55:30.774
They said their man told you to fix the door,
and you didn't do so.

55:32.816 --> 55:34.774
Are you saying it's his fault?

55:36.149 --> 55:40.524
Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering any of this.

55:48.234 --> 55:53.318
No. This store is all we have.

56:10.486 --> 56:12.526
I really am sorry.

56:35.069 --> 56:37.236
What time
you must go to work?

56:37.361 --> 56:38.611
Not until tonight.

56:40.361 --> 56:41.819
Go home and sleep.

56:45.070 --> 56:47.653
It's okay. It's okay.
Go home and sleep.

57:10.904 --> 57:11.947
Hey.

57:13.572 --> 57:16.946
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

57:17.071 --> 57:19.280
Yeah, they told me.

57:19.364 --> 57:22.155
I just wanted to say, good luck

57:22.280 --> 57:24.115
and it was good ridin' with you.

57:24.198 --> 57:25.865
You too.

57:28.864 --> 57:32.114
Wait till you've been
on the job a few more years.

57:32.239 --> 57:35.447
- Yeah.
- Look at me, look at me.

57:35.530 --> 57:40.155
Wait till you've been doin' it
a little longer.

57:40.280 --> 57:44.155
You think you know
who you are, hmm?

57:44.322 --> 57:47.073
You have no idea.

57:50.573 --> 57:53.573
Yo, Gomez,
you ready to roll, homie?

57:53.698 --> 57:55.531
Ready, amigo.

58:05.324 --> 58:08.366
Radio check, 2-1 -L-2-3.

58:08.491 --> 58:13.116
2-1-L-23, picking up screams and noises
from your car.

58:13.241 --> 58:17.033
21-L, is your mike open
by any chance?

01:00:29.374 --> 01:00:30.206
Call it in.

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:09.501
Ma'am?

01:01:09.584 --> 01:01:11.500
Can you hear me?

01:01:11.583 --> 01:01:14.166
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:17.333
- Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.
- Jesus.

01:01:21.001 --> 01:01:24.376
Ma'am, are you hurt?

01:01:24.501 --> 01:01:27.541
- Can you move?
- I-- I can't breathe.

01:01:30.626 --> 01:01:33.667
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

01:01:40.459 --> 01:01:41.918
It's okay.

01:01:46.126 --> 01:01:48.627
Okay. Okay.

01:01:48.752 --> 01:01:50.626
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

01:01:54.918 --> 01:01:57.002
No!

01:01:57.085 --> 01:02:00.044
- It's okay.
- Get away from me!

01:02:00.211 --> 01:02:03.210
Get away.
Stay away from me!

01:02:03.335 --> 01:02:06.628
Not you! Not you!

01:02:06.753 --> 01:02:09.544
- It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

01:02:09.628 --> 01:02:13.211
- Keep away from me!
- Lady, I'm tryin'-- I'm tryin' to help you.

01:02:13.378 --> 01:02:15.878
Fuck you! Not you!

01:02:16.003 --> 01:02:18.961
Somebody! Anybody else!

01:02:19.086 --> 01:02:22.712
- Please, somebody! Not you!
- Stop moving!

01:02:22.837 --> 01:02:26.337
No! Get your filthy
fucking hands off me!

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.586
Stop moving. Lady, I'm not
gonna fucking hurt you!

01:02:35.588 --> 01:02:38.671
Okay. Okay.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.630
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

01:02:40.755 --> 01:02:44.505
I'm not gonna touch you.
But there's nobody else here yet

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:46.588
and that's gasoline there.

01:02:48.254 --> 01:02:51.546
We need to get you
outta here right away. Okay?

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:53.837
Oh, my-- Oh, my--
Oh, my-- Oh, my God.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:59.630
Okay. I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?

01:03:02.922 --> 01:03:04.880
Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:06.255 --> 01:03:07.921
Thanks.

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:15.673
Is anything broken?

01:03:15.757 --> 01:03:18.214
I-I don't think so.

01:03:18.339 --> 01:03:21.257
Okay. Then that's good.

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.839
Are you-- Are you
gonna get me out?

01:03:23.964 --> 01:03:27.258
Yeah, I'm gonna get you out. Okay?

01:03:27.341 --> 01:03:30.673
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

01:03:36.883 --> 01:03:38.341
Oh, fuck!

01:03:38.466 --> 01:03:41.424
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:46.341
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?

01:03:46.466 --> 01:03:48.549
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

01:03:49.674 --> 01:03:51.132
It's okay, it's okay.

01:03:51.298 --> 01:03:53.883
It's okay.
Okay, we're gonna get you out.

01:03:54.008 --> 01:03:56.299
Everything's gonna be fine.
Look at me!

01:03:56.423 --> 01:03:58.883
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you outta here.

01:03:59.008 --> 01:04:00.799
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:04:17.343 --> 01:04:19.800
Ryan!

01:04:55.052 --> 01:04:56.469
Pull!

01:05:11.761 --> 01:05:13.052
It's okay.

01:05:22.513 --> 01:05:23.970
It's okay.

01:05:24.928 --> 01:05:28.553
All right.
It's okay, it's okay.

01:05:28.678 --> 01:05:31.138
It's all right.
I got it. I got it.

01:05:31.263 --> 01:05:33.222
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you walk with me?

01:05:33.347 --> 01:05:35.721
It's cool, it's cool.

01:05:37.138 --> 01:05:40.096
Here we go.
All right, you're doin' great.

01:06:11.306 --> 01:06:14.472
The D.A. wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

01:06:14.597 --> 01:06:17.306
No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work
none of us would have jobs.

01:06:17.431 --> 01:06:19.682
- Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.

01:06:19.807 --> 01:06:22.641
- Thanks for coming in.
- He just pulled into the garage.

01:06:22.724 --> 01:06:25.848
Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,
so we'll make this short.

01:06:25.973 --> 01:06:29.349
Internal Affairs says this Conklin
has two suspicious shootings on his record.

01:06:29.432 --> 01:06:32.682
Both black men.
Both times he was cleared, but only just.

01:06:32.807 --> 01:06:35.600
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

01:06:35.683 --> 01:06:39.141
You know any reason why
we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?

01:06:39.307 --> 01:06:44.307
Well, it's more complicated
than we originally thought.

01:06:44.432 --> 01:06:50.308
We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

01:06:50.392 --> 01:06:52.475
Shit!

01:06:52.558 --> 01:06:57.058
Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him
to stay in the car until he hears from me.

01:06:57.183 --> 01:07:01.058
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:05.350
The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.
We haven't been able to get in touch with her.

01:07:05.475 --> 01:07:08.600
Apparently she, uh,
left town this morning.

01:07:08.683 --> 01:07:12.517
So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not have
known the money was in it.

01:07:18.892 --> 01:07:22.185
You really think you're gonna
be able to make that fly?

01:07:23.893 --> 01:07:24.934
Give us a minute.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.727
No problem.

01:07:36.227 --> 01:07:38.436
Who knows about the money?

01:07:38.561 --> 01:07:40.560
You gotta be kiddin' me.

01:07:40.685 --> 01:07:44.520
There are only two people
in this room.

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:48.020
Myself, my partner,
Ferguson and Internal Affairs.

01:07:48.103 --> 01:07:50.562
- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.

01:07:55.103 --> 01:07:57.561
Okay. I guess
I don't see a problem.

01:07:57.645 --> 01:08:00.186
As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't
clear evidence of any wrongdoing.

01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:03.229
And even if it was, we aren't
going to prosecute a dead man.

01:08:03.353 --> 01:08:07.728
Which means the money Internal Affairs
is holding can't be considered evidence.

01:08:07.853 --> 01:08:10.145
You can do this dance if you want to,

01:08:10.228 --> 01:08:13.687
but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

01:08:13.812 --> 01:08:16.770
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:19.729
Fucking black people, huh?

01:08:19.812 --> 01:08:21.854
What did you just say?

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:23.937
I mean,

01:08:24.062 --> 01:08:26.520
I know all the sociological
reasons why per capita

01:08:26.687 --> 01:08:29.729
eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

01:08:29.854 --> 01:08:33.729
Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

01:08:33.812 --> 01:08:35.772
All that stuff.
All that stuff!

01:08:35.897 --> 01:08:39.938
But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man,

01:08:40.063 --> 01:08:42.981
they just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:50.314
Of course, you and I
know that's not the truth.

01:08:50.398 --> 01:08:52.398
But that's the way
it always plays, doesn't it?

01:08:52.564 --> 01:08:55.981
And assholes like Lewis keep
feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.

01:08:57.231 --> 01:08:59.564
What did you say
you did for the D.A. again?

01:08:59.649 --> 01:09:01.606
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

01:09:01.731 --> 01:09:03.648
Oh, please, don't do that.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:06.564
Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?

01:09:06.689 --> 01:09:11.064
What do you think those kids need...
to make them believe, to give them hope?

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.356
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:16.399
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

01:09:16.482 --> 01:09:21.064
Why don't you cut through the bullshit
and just tell me what it is you want.

01:09:23.107 --> 01:09:25.899
The D.A.'s squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

01:09:26.024 --> 01:09:29.899
Rick is quite adamant
that his replacement be a person of color.

01:09:29.982 --> 01:09:34.149
It's a high-profile position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

01:09:34.274 --> 01:09:37.899
And the right message is,
"Look at this black boy I just bought?"'

01:09:38.024 --> 01:09:41.608
Well, fuck you very much.
But thanks for thinking of me.

01:09:42.983 --> 01:09:45.401
Actually we were thinking of you.

01:09:46.774 --> 01:09:48.733
Until we saw that.

01:09:49.692 --> 01:09:50.901
It's your brother's file.

01:09:51.901 --> 01:09:54.109
Twenty-something years old
and already three felonies.

01:09:54.234 --> 01:09:56.902
Three strikes law. Kid's going away
for life for stealing a car.

01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:59.734
Christ, that's a shitty law.

01:09:59.859 --> 01:10:01.776
There's a warrant in there.

01:10:01.902 --> 01:10:06.234
But still, hey, he had
every opportunity you had.

01:10:09.068 --> 01:10:10.942
Fucking black people, huh?

01:10:15.317 --> 01:10:19.777
So all, uh-- all I need to do
to make this disappear

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:22.152
is to frame
a potentially innocent man?

01:10:22.277 --> 01:10:25.568
What are you? The fucking defender
of all things white?

01:10:25.652 --> 01:10:29.402
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

01:10:29.485 --> 01:10:34.236
And you're arguing with me that maybe
we're not being fair to him?

01:10:34.361 --> 01:10:37.319
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe Lewis did provoke this.

01:10:37.444 --> 01:10:39.569
And maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:42.695
Or maybe stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

01:10:42.779 --> 01:10:45.111
was enough to get him killed.

01:10:45.236 --> 01:10:49.279
There was no one there to see who shot first,
so there is no way to know.

01:10:49.404 --> 01:10:52.779
Which means we
could get this wrong.

01:10:54.612 --> 01:10:57.695
Maybe that's what happened with
your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

01:10:57.779 --> 01:11:02.237
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

01:11:03.154 --> 01:11:04.946
You're the one closest to all this.

01:11:05.071 --> 01:11:06.821
You need to tell us.

01:11:10.654 --> 01:11:13.112
What does your gut tell you?

01:11:25.863 --> 01:11:29.030
So? Graham?

01:11:29.155 --> 01:11:31.280
What do I tell 'em?

01:11:31.363 --> 01:11:35.281
You tell me, and I'll tell them.

01:11:41.946 --> 01:11:46.115
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

01:11:46.198 --> 01:11:49.282
it's pretty clear
what happened last night.

01:11:49.365 --> 01:11:51.948
Okay.

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:10.823
Before I get to why we're here,

01:12:10.948 --> 01:12:14.866
I know that many of you have heard
we had our car stolen last night.

01:12:14.991 --> 01:12:19.323
And as you could imagine, my wife and I
are both pretty shaken up.

01:12:19.448 --> 01:12:21.283
But we're okay.

01:12:21.366 --> 01:12:25.992
And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls
and your concern. Thank you.

01:12:26.117 --> 01:12:31.699
Now, just after 9:00 p. m. last night,
Detective William Lewis,

01:12:31.824 --> 01:12:34.949
an eight-year veteran of the force
and an active member of the black community,

01:12:35.074 --> 01:12:37.325
was gunned down
by a fellow officer.

01:13:37.744 --> 01:13:38.953
Get outta the car!

01:13:39.037 --> 01:13:40.912
Gimme the keys!
Get out-- What the fuck?

01:13:42.912 --> 01:13:44.953
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

01:13:45.037 --> 01:13:46.912
Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?

01:13:47.037 --> 01:13:47.912
Say that again!

01:13:50.037 --> 01:13:52.204
- Say that again!
- You stupid motherfucker!

01:13:52.371 --> 01:13:55.663
Say it again, huh!
Call me a nigger again!

01:13:55.746 --> 01:13:58.121
- Man, what the fuck? Get off!
- Fuck you!

01:13:58.204 --> 01:14:01.038
- Shoot him!
- I'll blow your head off!

01:14:01.163 --> 01:14:04.205
- Shoot this motherfucker!
- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!

01:14:04.330 --> 01:14:05.454
Stop talkin' and shoot!

01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:09.705
- Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.
- Get off of me!

01:14:11.788 --> 01:14:14.539
Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!

01:14:14.664 --> 01:14:16.621
- Oh, shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:20.455
Get the fuck outta my car!

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.829
Shit! Damn!

01:14:22.913 --> 01:14:25.122
- What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!
- Fuck you!

01:14:29.122 --> 01:14:32.456
Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
West bound.

01:14:33.206 --> 01:14:35.414
I will blow you away!
Get the fuck out of the car!

01:14:35.539 --> 01:14:36.955
Go on! Shoot me then!

01:14:38.706 --> 01:14:43.040
2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3--
Oh, Christ!

01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:50.791
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- You get the fuck outta the car!

01:14:50.873 --> 01:14:53.249
- Get outta the fucking car!
- It's my fucking car!

01:14:53.374 --> 01:14:55.707
- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck, it's my gun now!

01:14:55.832 --> 01:14:58.041
Gimme my fucking gun!

01:15:05.374 --> 01:15:07.125
Fuck!

01:15:08.917 --> 01:15:12.792
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

01:15:15.708 --> 01:15:19.666
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

01:15:22.958 --> 01:15:25.541
Slowly step out of the vehicle.

01:15:25.624 --> 01:15:29.333
- Get out of my car.
- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.

01:15:32.417 --> 01:15:36.209
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

01:15:48.876 --> 01:15:52.209
You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!

01:15:52.293 --> 01:15:53.669
Lie face down on the ground.

01:15:53.752 --> 01:15:56.419
- Spread your arms and legs.
- No, you lie face down!

01:15:56.544 --> 01:15:58.627
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

01:15:58.752 --> 01:16:01.210
Fuck you! What are you gonna do?
Pull the fucking trigger!

01:16:01.294 --> 01:16:02.252
On your knees now!

01:16:02.335 --> 01:16:05.045
You get on your knees
and suck my fucking dick!

01:16:05.211 --> 01:16:07.877
Do I look like
I'm fucking joking with you?

01:16:08.044 --> 01:16:09.545
That's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

01:16:09.711 --> 01:16:11.878
- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?

01:16:12.003 --> 01:16:14.336
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture.

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:18.128
- I know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.

01:16:18.253 --> 01:16:20.753
- Give me some space. I know this guy.
- Get outta the way.

01:16:20.878 --> 01:16:21.961
Step away.

01:16:22.086 --> 01:16:24.086
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

01:16:25.961 --> 01:16:28.544
- Man, don't walk up on me!
- See what's happening here?

01:16:28.627 --> 01:16:30.836
Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.920
'Cause these guys
really wanna shoot you.

01:16:33.003 --> 01:16:35.545
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:36.921
Fuck you!

01:16:37.004 --> 01:16:40.295
Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one.

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.296
'Cause you're the one
whose head's gonna be blown off!

01:16:43.421 --> 01:16:44.671
Officer Hanson, step away.

01:16:44.754 --> 01:16:48.212
He's a friend of mine, okay? He's a fucking
friend! This man is not armed!

01:16:48.379 --> 01:16:51.255
He's not gonna shoot you, me,
or anybody else, all right?

01:16:51.379 --> 01:16:53.379
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

01:16:53.504 --> 01:16:56.755
Lower your firearm.
Lower your firearm!

01:17:01.964 --> 01:17:05.255
You startin' to understand
the situation?

01:17:05.338 --> 01:17:08.006
What do you want from me?

01:17:08.131 --> 01:17:12.631
Unless you think your wife is better off with
a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,

01:17:12.798 --> 01:17:14.673
I want you to sit on that curb,
put your hands on your head

01:17:14.798 --> 01:17:17.006
and do nothing
until I speak with these officers.

01:17:17.131 --> 01:17:20.088
I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'
my hands on my head for nobody.

01:17:20.214 --> 01:17:24.214
Then stand where you are and keep your
hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?

01:17:27.298 --> 01:17:29.423
Yeah, I can do that.

01:17:29.548 --> 01:17:31.755
Good.

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:35.673
I told this man to stay where he is and keep his
hands in plain sight.

01:17:35.798 --> 01:17:40.549
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

01:17:40.632 --> 01:17:42.757
I need this favor.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.882
You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

01:17:47.007 --> 01:17:49.549
I need to let him go
with a warning.

01:17:49.674 --> 01:17:54.549
- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.

01:17:57.132 --> 01:17:58.966
Thank you.

01:18:01.841 --> 01:18:05.884
You've been warned. Do you understand me?
Do you understand me!

01:18:05.967 --> 01:18:09.258
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

01:18:09.341 --> 01:18:13.383
- I'm trying to help you.
- I didn't ask for your help, did I?

01:18:15.509 --> 01:18:17.717
Go home.

01:18:21.384 --> 01:18:23.717
Yeah, that I can do.

01:19:42.221 --> 01:19:44.137
Look at me.

01:19:45.596 --> 01:19:48.263
You embarrass me.

01:19:48.346 --> 01:19:50.470
You embarrass yourself.

01:20:33.598 --> 01:20:34.558
Daddy's home!

01:20:55.391 --> 01:20:56.475
- What's up?
- Give me my money!

01:20:56.559 --> 01:20:59.016
- What? What money?
- Daddy!

01:20:59.099 --> 01:21:02.350
- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

01:21:02.475 --> 01:21:03.974
Give me my money!

01:21:05.558 --> 01:21:07.629
I want my fucking money!
Give me that truck!

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.201
That's not my truck bro!

01:21:09.226 --> 01:21:11.059
- Daddy?
- Elizabeth!

01:21:11.184 --> 01:21:15.434
Hey, you know what?
Hey, I got $50. Here.

01:21:15.559 --> 01:21:17.600
Fifty dollars?
You took everything!

01:21:17.725 --> 01:21:18.351
Mommy?

01:21:20.143 --> 01:21:21.726
I'm coming, I'm coming!

01:21:21.851 --> 01:21:26.019
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

01:21:26.144 --> 01:21:30.351
I have it. He doesn't
have the impenetrable cloak!

01:21:31.561 --> 01:21:33.185
Lara, stay outta the street!

01:22:00.812 --> 01:22:04.478
- It's okay, Daddy.
- What-- What?

01:22:04.562 --> 01:22:06.020
I'll protect you.

01:22:33.271 --> 01:22:35.938
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

01:22:36.063 --> 01:22:39.063
It's a really good cloak.

01:23:46.107 --> 01:23:51.066
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

01:23:51.191 --> 01:23:53.067
Well, you are one to talk.

01:23:53.150 --> 01:23:57.025
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year?

01:23:57.108 --> 01:24:00.525
I'm not snapping at you!
I am angry.

01:24:01.776 --> 01:24:03.858
Yes! At them! Yes!

01:24:03.942 --> 01:24:08.276
At them, the police,
at Rick, at Maria,

01:24:08.401 --> 01:24:12.068
at the dry cleaners who destroyed
another blouse today,

01:24:12.193 --> 01:24:16.151
at the gardener who keeps
overwatering the lawn.

01:24:16.276 --> 01:24:17.402
I...

01:24:18.652 --> 01:24:21.194
I just thought that...

01:24:21.277 --> 01:24:24.819
Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up today

01:24:24.943 --> 01:24:27.944
and I would feel better, you know?

01:24:28.027 --> 01:24:31.985
But I was still mad.
And I realized--

01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:36.028
I realized that it had nothing
to do with my car being stolen.

01:24:38.069 --> 01:24:41.820
I wake up like this
every morning!

01:24:41.945 --> 01:24:45.903
I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.

01:24:45.986 --> 01:24:49.319
Carol, I don't know why! And I...

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:54.069
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

01:24:54.152 --> 01:24:56.028
Bye.

01:26:47.117 --> 01:26:49.075
Really appreciate this.

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:51.367
You're welcome.

01:26:57.201 --> 01:26:59.117
So how long you been out there tonight?
It's cold.

01:26:59.201 --> 01:27:01.326
Hour maybe.

01:27:01.451 --> 01:27:03.243
Big surprise, huh?

01:27:03.368 --> 01:27:06.617
Yeah, this ain't exactly
"pick up a brother" territory.

01:27:06.701 --> 01:27:08.492
True.

01:27:08.576 --> 01:27:10.535
So where you headed?

01:27:10.702 --> 01:27:12.827
Anywhere the other side
of the hill.

01:27:16.244 --> 01:27:18.493
That's some good music.

01:27:18.618 --> 01:27:20.535
Mm-hmm.

01:27:20.618 --> 01:27:24.035
No, really.
I'm startin' to understand it.

01:27:24.118 --> 01:27:27.161
Wrote me a country song
myself just yesterday.

01:27:27.286 --> 01:27:29.494
I'll bet you did.

01:27:44.829 --> 01:27:47.037
So what was goin' on
in the Valley tonight?

01:27:47.204 --> 01:27:48.829
Ice-skatin'.

01:27:49.995 --> 01:27:50.995
Ice-skatin'.

01:27:51.162 --> 01:27:53.704
Love the ice-skatin'.

01:27:53.829 --> 01:27:57.453
When I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a goalie.

01:27:57.536 --> 01:27:59.162
Come on!

01:27:59.245 --> 01:28:02.538
What, you-- you think
that's funny or somethin'?

01:28:02.621 --> 01:28:04.662
I think you're having fun.

01:28:04.745 --> 01:28:06.746
Yeah. Whatever.

01:28:16.538 --> 01:28:17.538
Something else funny?

01:28:17.663 --> 01:28:19.914
Oh, yeah.

01:28:22.246 --> 01:28:24.039
Yeah? What's that?

01:28:24.164 --> 01:28:25.914
People, man. People.

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.997
People like me.

01:28:30.623 --> 01:28:33.122
No, no, no, no.
I'm not laughin' at you, man.

01:28:34.122 --> 01:28:35.081
I can see that.

01:28:35.206 --> 01:28:38.872
- Why don't you laugh outside?
- Why are you gettin' all bent outta shape?

01:28:38.997 --> 01:28:41.707
I'm not gettin' bent, man.
Just pulling over.

01:28:44.248 --> 01:28:48.332
Come on, man, keep drivin'.
I said I'm not laughing at you.

01:28:48.415 --> 01:28:50.832
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

01:28:50.915 --> 01:28:53.498
Why you bein' a fucking jerk?
Just drive the car.

01:28:53.623 --> 01:28:55.498
I've got a better idea.
Get out now.

01:28:55.582 --> 01:28:57.207
Fine. You want me
to show you? I'll show you.

01:28:57.332 --> 01:28:59.957
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

01:29:00.082 --> 01:29:02.040
- Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to?
- Put your hands where I can see!

01:29:02.165 --> 01:29:05.041
You wanna see what's in my hands?
I'll show you what's in my fuckin' hands!

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.960
Oh, God.

01:30:18.419 --> 01:30:22.794
Thank you, Brother Merle.
That Was Merle Haggard on KYHA.

01:30:22.919 --> 01:30:25.003
The scene of country music
here in L.A.

01:30:25.087 --> 01:30:27.294
It's a cold night,
and it's getting colder.

01:30:27.419 --> 01:30:31.378
We're giving out tickets to the rodeo coming
to the Fairplex in Pomona.

01:30:34.962 --> 01:30:39.212
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezin'.

01:30:39.295 --> 01:30:42.254
Shit. I heard it might snow.

01:30:42.379 --> 01:30:44.712
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

01:30:44.795 --> 01:30:48.089
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

01:30:48.172 --> 01:30:50.338
Yeah, me too.

01:30:50.463 --> 01:30:55.629
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

01:30:55.754 --> 01:30:58.213
Hey, Bob.

01:32:25.259 --> 01:32:28.258
Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!

01:32:28.384 --> 01:32:31.301
- Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
- Do you speak English?

01:32:31.384 --> 01:32:35.384
I am speaking English, you stupid cow!
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

01:32:37.634 --> 01:32:39.176
- Jin Gui!
- Ma'am!

01:32:39.301 --> 01:32:42.469
Kim Lee.

01:32:48.427 --> 01:32:52.552
I thought you were dead.
I called every hospital.

01:32:52.677 --> 01:32:54.428
It's okay. I'm okay.

01:32:54.511 --> 01:32:57.302
Thank you for finding me.

01:33:00.011 --> 01:33:03.510
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.

01:33:03.635 --> 01:33:05.385
Go to the locker.

01:33:09.594 --> 01:33:11.510
No, next one.

01:33:14.594 --> 01:33:17.345
In my wallet, there's a check.

01:33:17.511 --> 01:33:19.636
Bring it here.

01:33:27.636 --> 01:33:30.845
Oh, I get it. When I said get me
a black Lincoln Navigator,

01:33:30.971 --> 01:33:34.346
you thought I said get me
a white piece of shit panel van.

01:33:34.429 --> 01:33:39.471
- Fine, fine. Just give me whatever for it.
- You should see this.

01:33:55.513 --> 01:33:57.473
I'll take the van.

01:33:58.556 --> 01:33:59.847
They're chained to the van.

01:33:59.972 --> 01:34:01.555
So I'll take them too.

01:34:03.014 --> 01:34:04.972
You wanna buy these Chinamen?

01:34:05.097 --> 01:34:07.638
Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.

01:34:07.722 --> 01:34:09.473
Entirely different kind of chinks.

01:34:09.556 --> 01:34:12.638
- What the hell are you gonna do with 'em?
- Sell 'em. What you think?

01:34:12.763 --> 01:34:17.097
I'll give you 500 apiece,
and you can keep the van.

01:34:35.224 --> 01:34:38.224
Oh, no!

01:34:41.932 --> 01:34:44.183
No! No!

01:35:00.309 --> 01:35:02.225
This is Dorri.

01:35:09.975 --> 01:35:12.184
Oh.

01:35:12.267 --> 01:35:14.600
Oh. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:35:14.725 --> 01:35:18.892
My baby. My poor baby!

01:35:21.184 --> 01:35:23.017
Mom.

01:35:23.727 --> 01:35:28.392
I promise you... I promise I'm gonna
find out who did this, Mom.

01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:33.060
Oh, I already know.

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:36.810
You did.

01:35:39.143 --> 01:35:43.768
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

01:35:43.893 --> 01:35:47.686
We weren't much good
to you anymore, were we?

01:35:52.061 --> 01:35:55.019
You got things to do. You go ahead.
I'll sign the papers.

01:35:55.103 --> 01:35:57.019
I wanna stay.

01:35:57.103 --> 01:36:00.769
I just wanna wait
with my baby.

01:36:11.478 --> 01:36:12.436
He came home.

01:36:13.519 --> 01:36:15.437
Did you know that?

01:36:15.562 --> 01:36:18.394
My little boy.

01:36:18.478 --> 01:36:20.270
When I was sleepin',

01:36:20.395 --> 01:36:23.437
he brought me groceries.

01:36:23.562 --> 01:36:25.520
It's the last thing he did.

01:37:04.815 --> 01:37:06.815
What happened?

01:37:13.357 --> 01:37:15.231
What did you do?

01:37:16.314 --> 01:37:18.857
What did you do?

01:37:21.064 --> 01:37:22.982
I shoot a little girl.

01:37:23.107 --> 01:37:25.315
What?

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:28.232
No, she's okay. She's--

01:37:29.858 --> 01:37:32.065
She's-- Here.

01:37:32.190 --> 01:37:37.315
The gun shoot her,
but she's okay, Dorri.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.399
Nothing happened.

01:37:42.109 --> 01:37:43.358
She's my--

01:37:45.024 --> 01:37:46.774
What are you
talking about, Daddy?

01:37:50.566 --> 01:37:52.359
My angel.

01:37:54.484 --> 01:37:56.442
My angel!

01:37:58.234 --> 01:38:00.900
She came to protect me.

01:38:02.234 --> 01:38:04.610
To protect us!

01:38:06.359 --> 01:38:08.151
You understand?

01:38:12.484 --> 01:38:14.526
Take this. Please.

01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:17.984
Take it.

01:38:22.401 --> 01:38:24.859
Hey! Hey!

01:38:24.984 --> 01:38:28.611
Everything is okay, Dorri.

01:38:28.735 --> 01:38:30.443
It's okay.

01:38:35.485 --> 01:38:37.110
Okay, Daddy.

01:38:37.235 --> 01:38:38.819
Okay.

01:39:02.278 --> 01:39:03.237
Jean?

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:05.362
- Rick?
- Yeah. What's wrong.

01:39:05.487 --> 01:39:08.113
I fell down the stairs.

01:39:08.196 --> 01:39:11.529
- Are you all right?
- I tried calling you.

01:39:11.654 --> 01:39:14.820
I couldn't get through
to anyone. Not--

01:39:14.945 --> 01:39:18.363
Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie.

01:39:18.488 --> 01:39:21.195
I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in my car.
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.279
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

01:39:24.446 --> 01:39:26.862
Carol was the only one
that was home and

01:39:26.987 --> 01:39:30.613
she said she couldn't come get me because
she was getting a massage.

01:39:30.738 --> 01:39:33.113
That's because she's a bitch.

01:39:33.196 --> 01:39:36.072
She's been my friend for ten years.

01:39:37.239 --> 01:39:39.154
All right, honey.
Feel better.

01:39:39.238 --> 01:39:41.489
I'll be there soon.

01:39:43.697 --> 01:39:45.614
I love you.

01:39:45.697 --> 01:39:47.948
I love you too.

01:40:10.199 --> 01:40:12.282
Miss Jean.

01:40:14.324 --> 01:40:16.949
Would you like to sit up?

01:40:22.616 --> 01:40:25.824
Here. Good!

01:40:34.450 --> 01:40:36.616
Do you wanna hear
something funny?

01:40:36.741 --> 01:40:38.700
What, Mrs. Jean?

01:40:40.533 --> 01:40:43.242
You're the best friend I've got.

01:43:57.210 --> 01:43:58.668
Hi.

01:43:59.252 --> 01:44:01.002
Hi.

01:44:06.543 --> 01:44:07.668
I love you.

01:45:37.465 --> 01:45:39.339
All right.

01:45:39.464 --> 01:45:42.714
Everybody out, man.
You're free to go.

01:45:45.631 --> 01:45:47.965
All right, come on.

01:45:48.048 --> 01:45:51.382
Come on now! This is America.
Time is money. Chop, chop!

01:45:51.465 --> 01:45:53.090
Come on, y'all.

01:45:56.383 --> 01:45:58.007
Come on.

01:46:22.509 --> 01:46:24.551
That's $40.

01:46:24.676 --> 01:46:27.635
Buy everybody chop suey.
You understand?

01:46:29.051 --> 01:46:31.509
Dopey fucking Chinaman.

01:47:02.511 --> 01:47:04.302
Aah! Oh, my God!

01:47:04.386 --> 01:47:06.469
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:47:08.177 --> 01:47:11.761
Uh-uh! Don't talk to me
unless you speak American!
