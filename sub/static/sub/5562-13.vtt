¶ ¶

00:15.583 --> 00:17.449
Gentlemen,

00:17.451 --> 00:19.551
Welcome aboard.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.188
We had quite the haul today.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.190
Yellowtail, rockfish,

00:25.192 --> 00:27.726
Even some tuna,
and it's not even the season.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.396
I hope you pulled more
from that water than just fish.

00:30.398 --> 00:33.098
It was anchored right where
you told me it would be.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.370
Voilà.
Go ahead, taste it.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.439
You're lucky
the sharks didn't.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.544
I hope you brought
my cash.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.716
Now, we only ran
into one problem.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.551
What's that?
I ain't no fisherman.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.053
Feds!
Hold it!

00:54.055 --> 00:56.221
Freeze!
Federal agents!

00:56.223 --> 00:57.289
Damn it, reynolds.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.358
That's our evidence.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.392
Yeah, I'm good, boss,

01:00.394 --> 01:01.727
Thanks a lot.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.397
Oh, what the hell?

01:07.068 --> 01:08.067
We got a body.

01:08.069 --> 01:11.103
You'd better
call someone.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.105

01:38.833 --> 01:40.132
(sighs)

01:40.134 --> 01:42.534
I mean, a phone call
would've been nice.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.104
A text.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.673
Hell, an-an e-mail, just so I'd
know you tried to contact me.

01:47.675 --> 01:48.841
Good morning?

01:48.843 --> 01:50.209
We carpool to work.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.412
Today you weren't home.
I'm already here.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.247
I know that. Now.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.818
I took my own car.
Didn't want to wake you.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.488
It was very early.
What's so important
you had to come in early?

02:02.490 --> 02:04.556
Nothing.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.625
Really?
Really.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.494
I thought we
talked about this, g.

02:08.496 --> 02:11.230
I promise you I will
send you a text next time.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.698
I'm talking about you
returning to old habits.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.666
Keeping things
from the team, from me.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.335
Going rogue.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.703
Callen's going
rogue again?
Oh, nice,

02:17.705 --> 02:19.371
Can I shadow you? It's
the only way I'll learn.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.373
Not going rogue.
I actually came to work early,

02:21.375 --> 02:24.343
Which is literally
the opposite of going rogue.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.345
What's in the file, g?

02:26.347 --> 02:28.180
Why are you making
this a thing?

02:28.182 --> 02:29.414
Is it a thing?
It's not a thing,

02:29.416 --> 02:31.450
But you're making it one.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.919
You guys sound like
an old married couple.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.188
Deeks:
Ooh, smooth, kensilina.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.690
Garret odell.
Who's garret odell?

02:38.692 --> 02:40.392
He's no one. He's clean.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.660
But ever since
our names

02:41.662 --> 02:43.428
Were leaked last year,
I have made a point

02:43.430 --> 02:46.265
Of trying to keep tabs on
new people that enter our lives.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.167
So whose life
is he entering into?

02:48.169 --> 02:49.902
Kensi:
Attorney, divorced.

02:49.904 --> 02:53.705
One child,
six years old.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.807
Who goes to mccadden elementary.
Hmm.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.309
Joelle's school.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.912
Now it's a thing.

02:59.914 --> 03:02.881
Whoa.
This guy's dating joelle?

03:02.883 --> 03:04.783
No, I stopped by her house
to drop some things off,

03:04.785 --> 03:07.186
They were having dinner, okay?

03:07.188 --> 03:09.388
You guys broke up, like, a month
ago? I mean, that's fast.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.690
That's too fast. This man
has a right to be suspicious.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.892
I think the word is "jealous."

03:13.894 --> 03:15.561
I broke up with her, remember?

03:15.562 --> 03:17.229
Look, I don't need
to defend myself, okay?

03:17.231 --> 03:19.731
I was looking out for her
and for the team, case closed.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.234
Eric (whistles):
You know what they say,

03:22.236 --> 03:23.835
When callen closes a case,

03:23.837 --> 03:26.538
Eric beale-- he opens a window.

03:27.608 --> 03:28.924
To another case.

03:28.925 --> 03:30.241
Ooh, that sounded
better in my head.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.877
(clears throat)
granger wants you in ops.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.279
There's your file.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.249
We done with this thing?

03:37.251 --> 03:39.251
I mean, if you say it's not
a thing, it's not a thing.
It's not a thing.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.320
Unless you don't
realize it's a thing.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.789
You keep that up,
we're gonna have a thing.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.860
Early this morning,
the coast guard pulled the body

03:48.862 --> 03:50.996
Of larry overson
from the marina.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.998
Overson?
I know that name.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.767
Not only do I know his
name, I read his book.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.603
You listened to his book on tape
on the way to work,

03:57.605 --> 03:58.904
Which means
I had to listen to it.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.740
If you want out of the car pool,
just let me know.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.242
Okay, guys,

04:03.244 --> 04:04.710
I don't know the name, so...

04:04.712 --> 04:07.346
Larry overson is
the tech entrepreneur

04:07.348 --> 04:10.582
Who founded the antivirus
company overguard

04:10.584 --> 04:12.818
And then sold it
for nearly a billion dollars.

04:12.820 --> 04:13.986
He then parlayed that cash

04:13.988 --> 04:16.021
Into a successful
venture capital fund.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.589
He was
what's known as

04:17.591 --> 04:18.957
An angel investor, providing

04:18.959 --> 04:20.726
Seed money to tech and
internet start-ups.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.261
He wrote a book

04:22.262 --> 04:23.795
About what it takes
to run a successful business

04:23.797 --> 04:25.964
And how to adapt
to changing markets.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.432
He had good instincts.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.901
He was a little full of himself.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.303
Do you have a billion dollars?

04:31.305 --> 04:32.471
I don't need a billion dollars.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.374
What's going on with these two?

04:35.376 --> 04:36.975
They're just having a thing.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.510
Sorry I asked.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.711
Nell: Anyway, before he
was an angel investor,

04:39.713 --> 04:41.346
Overson was in the navy.

04:41.348 --> 04:44.416
Eric: He was assigned to the
national security agency,

04:44.418 --> 04:46.618
Where he was instrumental
in developing

04:46.620 --> 04:49.888
Part of their
mass data collection program.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.323
Now, that I didn't read
in the book.

04:51.325 --> 04:52.557
It was highly
classified,

04:52.559 --> 04:55.360
And for that reason,
secnav has tasked us

04:55.362 --> 04:56.862
To investigate his murder.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.063
We got a crime scene?

04:58.065 --> 04:59.498
We do.
Overson's boat.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.933
Tied up in basin g
of the marina.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.303
Cgis is coordinating

05:04.305 --> 05:06.471
The forensic investigation,
but no suspects so far.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.641
The last phone call overson
made was to former lieutenant

05:09.643 --> 05:13.045
Mark powell. Now, they
worked together at the nsa

05:13.047 --> 05:16.782
And, by all accounts, they were
best friends. Until powell sued

05:16.784 --> 05:18.684
Overson for a
share of overguard,

05:18.686 --> 05:21.019
Claiming that they developed
the software together.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.788
Powell lost the case

05:22.790 --> 05:24.056
Along with a lot of money
in attorney's fees.

05:24.058 --> 05:26.525
Which is probably
why he's been living

05:26.527 --> 05:28.093
Out of his car for
the last month.

05:28.095 --> 05:31.363
It was last seen entering a
vacant lot in westchester.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.732
All right, we'll check out
powell. You two search the boat,

05:33.734 --> 05:35.967
Bring nell with you.
Chances are,

05:35.969 --> 05:38.370
Overson's got a pretty serious
alarm system on board.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.071
Nell:
You've got the conn,

05:39.073 --> 05:41.606
Mr. Beale.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.743
Kensi:
Sounds promising.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.346
All right, thanks, great,
thank you, eric, bye.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.348
What do we know?

05:49.350 --> 05:51.483
So eric spoke to overson's
office back in san jose.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.085
It seems he sailed
down last week

05:53.087 --> 05:56.021
To meet with several tech
companies here at silicon beach.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.756
Did you say silicone beach?
'cause that sounds amazing.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.057
We should probably go there,

05:59.059 --> 06:00.892
Maybe do
some covert surveillance.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.561
Yeah? Maybe I tell your
girlfriend you said that.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.996
Mm-mm, no,
don't tell her that.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.065
Silicon beach,
much like silicon valley.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.734
It's what they're calling
the new tech start-up scene

06:08.736 --> 06:10.469
Here in l.A.
Overson was meeting

06:10.471 --> 06:13.772
With these companies
to consider investing.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.841
Well, if he denied one of them,
that's motive right there.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.142
Well, eric is accessing
his calendar

06:17.144 --> 06:19.077
To find this list of companies.

06:19.078 --> 06:21.011
Nellasaurus, what do you got--
anything from the cameras?

06:21.014 --> 06:24.416
That's a no-go. Overson
had the cloud backup disabled.

06:24.418 --> 06:27.152
I'm guessing he didn't want his
former employer spying on him.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.854
Okay, so where
did the feed go?

06:28.856 --> 06:31.790
To his laptop,
which... Is also missing.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.092
Well, overson went in the water.
Maybe the laptop did, too.
We should get

06:34.094 --> 06:35.761
The coast guard to search
the surrounding waters.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.497
Yup. That sounds like
a great idea.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.699
Oh, hey, you okay?

06:40.701 --> 06:43.001
Guys, I don't do
so well with boats.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.069
It's the rocking

06:44.071 --> 06:45.771
And then the stomach.

06:45.773 --> 06:49.141
It's not the best combination.
You do realize

06:49.143 --> 06:51.076
That, uh, you're an ncis agent.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.412
Where the "n"
stands for "naval".

06:53.414 --> 06:54.913
I don't mean, like,
a belly button kind.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.115
Oh. Thanks, captain obvious.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.818
I think navy ships
are a little bit bigger.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.053
Where you going, gilligan?
Pretty sure
marina security isn't

07:02.055 --> 07:03.522
As cautious
with their cameras.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.957
The "I" is for "investigative."

07:05.959 --> 07:07.392
Oh, wow,
and "s"

07:07.393 --> 07:08.826
Stands for "show-off."
well played.
(phone buzzes)

07:08.829 --> 07:11.430
I'll collect the video
and bring it back to ops.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.131
You're welcome.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.500
All right, eric just sent
the list of companies.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.936
We are going to
silicon beach.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.521
God, it'd be so much more fun

07:19.522 --> 07:21.105
If they just added
the "e" at the end.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.647
Powell's car.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.682
Pretty sure I've
lived in worse.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.452
That was by choice,
not necessity.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.824
No one's home.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.159
And it's unlocked.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.228
I'm guessing he
left in a hurry.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.101
How was this guy ever
in the navy?

07:50.103 --> 07:51.236
Looks like kensi's desk
back here.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.680
I think I know why eric
can't trace his cell phone.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.516
He smashed it.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.051
Sim card's gone.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.619
So's his stuff.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.187
I don't think he's coming back.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.188
(line ringing)

08:10.190 --> 08:11.790
Eric:
Hey, callen.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.658
Eric, powell's gone,
and he smashed his cell phone.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.926
Why don't you start checking

08:14.928 --> 08:16.495
Local cameras,
see if you can find him.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.063
Well, we've got him
on at least one camera already.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.799
Nell found security footage
of powell at the marina.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.501
I'm sending it to
your phone now.

08:22.503 --> 08:25.537
The time code matches up with
the medical examiner's estimate

08:25.539 --> 08:26.705
Of overson's time of death.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.807
Powell was there.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.512
What's a little murder
between friends?

08:45.626 --> 08:47.158
Woman:
Miles, you're gonna be
late for the meeting.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.860
I'm on my way down.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.696
So what am I looking at,
exactly?

08:51.698 --> 08:53.732
It's a flibbit. It's a
social networking app

08:53.734 --> 08:55.600
That allows
anonymous posting.

08:55.602 --> 08:58.236
When I swipe it here,

08:58.238 --> 09:01.640
It reveals the hidden
message. In this one,

09:01.642 --> 09:03.775
The user's expressing irritation
with a co-worker.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.310
But it could just as easily be

09:05.312 --> 09:08.647
The sharing of a secret,
a declaration of love,

09:08.649 --> 09:12.584
Even a political statement.
But again, all anonymous.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.019
And larry overson
was interested?

09:14.021 --> 09:15.987
Yeah. So were we,

09:15.989 --> 09:18.590
And I don't just mean his money.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.792
Larry is...

09:20.794 --> 09:23.595
He<i> was,</i> um...

09:23.597 --> 09:25.830
A real inspiration.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.032
Sorry.
(sniffles)

09:27.034 --> 09:29.100
No, take your time.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.705
So, it seems flibbit was
really successful already--

09:33.707 --> 09:35.607
Why did you guys
need more money?

09:35.609 --> 09:37.175
We always need more.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.678
We won't see profit
for at least another few years.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.880
And since we provide
flibbit ad-free,

09:41.882 --> 09:44.149
We're already looking to
the next round of funding.

09:44.151 --> 09:47.185
I hate talking about money
at a time like this,

09:47.187 --> 09:50.155
But we really needed
larry's investment.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.357
I'm sorry to change
the subject,

09:52.359 --> 09:54.092
Who's that guy
in the suit?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.027
That's vincent,
our new head of security.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.597
Military veteran?

09:58.599 --> 10:00.365
No. Not that I know of.

10:00.367 --> 10:04.336
But we should really
hire some. Do our part.
Mm.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.171
Remind me to hire
military veterans.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.306
Male voice:
Okay, I'll remind you.

10:08.308 --> 10:11.676
I think that's
a great idea.

10:11.678 --> 10:14.813
Very efficient.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.348
Deeks:
Explain it to me, exactly.

10:16.350 --> 10:19.150
We'll be the first on-demand
butler service for pets.

10:19.152 --> 10:22.120
Get it? Muttler.
It's called muttler.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.356
Yeah, no, I get it.
It's-it's really clever.

10:24.358 --> 10:27.092
Um, just seems like a
pretty narrow market.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.928
30% of los angeles
households have pets.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.863
That's, like, a million people.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.164
I bet you have a pet.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.200
A dog. Monty.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.068
Does monty have a butler?

10:37.070 --> 10:40.171
No. No, he does not.

10:40.173 --> 10:45.143
So larry overson wanted
to invest in the start-up?

10:45.145 --> 10:48.380
We, uh... We pitched him,
but ultimately

10:48.382 --> 10:51.016
Larry decided it wasn't
the right investment for him.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.885
Being denied by larry-- I mean,
that must have been tough.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.887
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.157
To have your hero tell you no?
Doesn't feel very good.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.693
But then I remembered
what he said in his book.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.728
"to be a success,

11:03.730 --> 11:07.098
You need one yes
and a million noes."

11:07.100 --> 11:09.267
So I'm confident
I'm gonna get my yes.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.069
Okay, all right.
Just one other thing.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.337
Do you always
take time off

11:12.339 --> 11:14.973
In the middle of the
workday to go surfing?

11:14.975 --> 11:16.274
Oh, no, we're not
taking time off work.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.409
This is our weekly
board meeting.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.411
You get it? Board meeting.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.212
Yeah. No, I got it.
Still very clever.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.914
All right, brother.
Good luck with that.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.115
Let's go!

11:24.117 --> 11:26.885
Wow. So, what do we know?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.687
Interviewed four companies,
and the only one

11:28.689 --> 11:30.188
That overson invested
in was an app

11:30.190 --> 11:32.724
That finds the nearest
public restroom.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.826
I'm telling you, this is not
the venice I grew up in.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.761
Although I'm not getting
a murder vibe from anybody.

11:36.763 --> 11:39.097
And from callen and sam,

11:39.099 --> 11:40.365
Overson's friend
powell is on the run.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.267
So how many have we got left?

11:42.269 --> 11:45.437
Uh, three, all of which are
valued in the tens of millions.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.172
God. See, you know what?

11:47.174 --> 11:48.840
If silicon beach was around
when I was younger,

11:48.842 --> 11:50.408
I'm pretty sure
I would have crushed it.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.444
I'm pretty sure
you would have crashed it.

11:52.446 --> 11:54.446
But I am an idea man.
You know this about me.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.715
I do, but not necessarily for
complex computer programs.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.216
Yeah, but I'd just
hire those people.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.951
I'd have, like,
an army of beales

11:59.953 --> 12:01.753
Toiling away in the data mine.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.054
And what are you doing
in the meantime? Just surfing?

12:03.056 --> 12:04.055
Yeah, it's called
a board meeting,

12:04.057 --> 12:05.156
And it's very professional.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.225
Wow. Three more
stops. Let's go.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.160
You know what? I'm thinking
about getting monty a butler.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.162
You<i> are</i> monty's butler.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.263
Oh, yeah.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.234
What have we got?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.986
We found powell.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.737
He boarded metro local 248
half an hour ago,

12:19.740 --> 12:21.406
Headed to long beach.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.073
Nell:
And one of its last stops
would leave him four blocks

12:23.076 --> 12:24.576
From the metro station.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.077
Sam:
From there, he could make
it to san diego.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.378
From san diego to mexico.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.881
Mexico... The world.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.120
Sorry. If you leave now,
you can catch him in long beach.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.073
Hey, buddy, can I borrow
some change for the bus?

12:55.075 --> 12:56.908
No. Sorry.
Can I borrow
your phone?

12:56.910 --> 12:58.660
I got to tell my boss I'm gonna
be a little late for work.

12:58.661 --> 13:00.411
No, no phone.
No phone? Who
doesn't have a phone these days?

13:00.413 --> 13:03.348
Everyone's got a phone.
Oh, don't you remember?

13:03.350 --> 13:04.949
He smashed his
so we couldn't track him.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.951
That's right.
Right around the same time

13:06.953 --> 13:09.420
His old navy buddy,
larry overson, was murdered.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.523
Mark, we're federal agents.

13:11.525 --> 13:15.193
(sighs)

13:18.231 --> 13:21.266
(grunting)

13:22.068 --> 13:23.968
That hurt?

13:23.970 --> 13:26.371
Looks like you've been
in a fight recently.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.273
Gonna ask you a few questions
about that.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.208
I'm not saying anything
without my lawyer.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.279
Let's go.
(groans)

13:39.319 --> 13:41.953
Callen:
Got to say, it is
really tempting

13:41.955 --> 13:43.388
To just turn
that sound back on.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.390
Sam:
That would be an
invasion of privacy.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.459
I know how important
privacy is to you.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.528
You cannot tell me
that you don't check

13:50.530 --> 13:52.363
On people who enter
your family's life.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.332
Joelle isn't in your life
anymore.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.568
But apparently
she's still in your thoughts.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.937
Oh, you read minds now? What
color am I thinking of, huh?

13:58.939 --> 14:01.906
I'm just trying to make sure
you're not crossing a line, g.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.341
I'm not crossing any line,
but it sure feels like

14:03.343 --> 14:04.843
You're invading my privacy.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.345
Okay.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.414
We're ready.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.951
Blue.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.319
That was the color,
wasn't it?

14:14.321 --> 14:16.321
Oh, it was
definitely blue.

14:20.894 --> 14:23.094
It'll be okay.

14:23.096 --> 14:27.098
How the ribs doing?
Still hurt?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.466
Out of curiosity,
isn't this the same lawyer

14:28.468 --> 14:30.468
That lost your suit
against, uh, overson?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.971
Gentlemen, is that really
pertinent to the matter at hand?

14:32.973 --> 14:35.106
That'd be a yes.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.309
You know, intellectual property
law doesn't exactly qualify you

14:38.311 --> 14:39.611
For a murder case.

14:39.613 --> 14:42.146
I didn't kill larry.
Callen:
You've got bruises

14:42.148 --> 14:43.765
On your face and
your abdomen.

14:43.766 --> 14:45.383
Larry overson's body also
showed signs of a struggle.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.352
And we have you on video
leaving the marina

14:47.354 --> 14:48.653
Around the time of his death.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.455
I didn't say I wasn't there.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.223
I said I didn't kill him.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.128
When larry and I were
at the nsa...
Mark, stop.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.897
I advise you not to speak
about that.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.665
No, I'm not gonna hide it
anymore.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.967
I don't care
what the punishment is.

15:02.969 --> 15:07.438
Okay. Uh, I think you're right,
agent hanna.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.540
I am...
I'm out of my depth. Uh...

15:09.542 --> 15:11.276
Uh, I'm afraid

15:11.278 --> 15:14.479
I can't represent you,
mark. I'm sorry.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.381
I'll just
let myself out.
Yeah, yeah.

15:16.383 --> 15:19.484
Thank you.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.255
Ah, to hell with it.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.924
What did lawyers ever get me?

15:25.926 --> 15:27.992
We're listening.

15:30.497 --> 15:34.432
When larry and I were
at the nsa,

15:34.434 --> 15:36.334
It was our job to innovate.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.169
Create new tools
for cyber warfare.

15:38.171 --> 15:41.406
We made something, a daemon.

15:41.408 --> 15:42.707
Sam:
It's a computer program

15:42.709 --> 15:44.475
That runs in the background
of a system.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.377
That's right.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.380
But unlike other daemons, ours
was completely undetectable.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.983
And it was around that same
time, we started to find out

15:51.985 --> 15:53.418
Just what the nsa was doing

15:53.420 --> 15:55.954
With the other tools
we were giving them.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.289
You mean mass data collection.
I mean spying.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.525
On american citizens.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.460
And that crossed a line.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.995
Larry and I decided

16:03.997 --> 16:06.230
That the potential
for abuse was too great.

16:06.232 --> 16:10.401
So we mutually agreed not to
tell the nsa about our daemon.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.070
You developed it at the nsa,

16:12.072 --> 16:14.672
So it's considered
classified defense material.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.574
You violated the espionage act.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.210
Which is why I was running.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.546
I thought
larry had turned me in.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.414
He broke the law, too.
Why would you think that?

16:23.416 --> 16:26.084
Because last night,
larry called me.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.186
He said he wanted
to meet on his boat.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.155
I thought he was finally going
to apologize

16:31.157 --> 16:32.991
For cutting me out of overguard.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.426
Instead, he accuses me
of selling our daemon.

16:35.428 --> 16:38.596
After all that he put me
through, so, yeah,

16:38.598 --> 16:40.198
I got mad and we fought,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.400
But when I left, he was alive.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.602
Why did he think
you sold the daemon?

16:44.604 --> 16:47.271
He said he found it hidden in
the code of a smart phone app.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.173
An app from one of the companies
he was interested in.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.575
Which company?

16:50.577 --> 16:51.576
What-what was the app?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.244
I don't know.

16:53.246 --> 16:56.047
I think he wanted me to say it
to confirm his suspicion,

16:56.049 --> 17:00.618
But, listen, I've had my money
trouble the last few years,

17:00.620 --> 17:03.454
But this is a line
I would never cross.

17:03.456 --> 17:07.525
Someone else must have gotten
their hands on the daemon.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.761
If used effectively,

17:09.763 --> 17:14.165
Our daemon would provide
an untraceable, all-access pass

17:14.167 --> 17:16.334
To the digital secrets
of anyone who had the app.

17:16.336 --> 17:20.038
You believe him?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.473
It's not a bad story.
It gets him off the hook.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.808
And it's not too far-fetched.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.643
Foreign intelligence agencies
have been trying

17:25.645 --> 17:28.346
To infiltrate american
tech companies for years.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.582
We'll continue to hold powell,
but regardless of whether or not

17:31.584 --> 17:34.552
His story is true,
we need to investigate.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.221
Imagine if someone put
this daemon into twitter.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.691
Millions would be compromised.

17:40.693 --> 17:44.295
Data thieves, terrorists,
enemies of state--

17:44.297 --> 17:47.432
They would all kill
for that kind of access.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.069
So would we.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.615
While he was visiting
silicon beach,

18:04.617 --> 18:07.185
Overson met with seven
different tech companies,

18:07.187 --> 18:09.220
But based on kensi's
and deeks' interviews,

18:09.222 --> 18:11.355
We know he was really
only interested in two.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.774
One of 'em's just a start-up.

18:12.775 --> 18:14.192
They haven't released
their app yet.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.844
And if what powell
says is true,

18:15.845 --> 18:17.495
The daemon is worthless
if it's not on
anyone's phone.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.230
Which leaves
flibbit.

18:19.232 --> 18:22.333
After only 16 months
of operation, they already have

18:22.335 --> 18:24.469
Over 20 million users.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.471
That's a large pool
of data to draw from.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.738
Perfect place
to hide the daemon.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.540
And we may have
our first suspect.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.775
Nell:
Vincent lee,

18:30.777 --> 18:32.477
Flibbit's new head of security.

18:32.479 --> 18:33.644
Kensi:
I noticed him immediately.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.379
For one, the other companies

18:35.381 --> 18:36.647
Didn't even have
a security guard,

18:36.649 --> 18:38.416
But he was armed,
always alert.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.218
I thought he might
be military.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.419
Nell:
But he's not
one of ours.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.188
In fact, vincent lee
barely exists.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.224
His work experience,
his schooling--

18:46.226 --> 18:48.459
It all looks great
on his résumé.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.528
But we double-checked
his sources, nothing tracked.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.196
Even the phone numbers
he used for references

18:52.198 --> 18:53.197
Have been
deactivated.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.565
Yeah, they're covers.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.367
When flibbit called
to check on lee,

18:56.369 --> 18:58.369
They got someone who was
assigned to verify his backstop.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.804
Sam:
Okay.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.206
So, if we assume lee has
the daemon,

19:02.208 --> 19:03.674
Who's he working for?

19:03.676 --> 19:05.243
I wish I could
tell you.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.612
Well, I may know
someone who can.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.779
Wilson rowe.

19:08.781 --> 19:09.780
Callen:
Powell's lawyer?

19:09.782 --> 19:10.882
If powell didn't
sell the daemon,

19:10.884 --> 19:12.283
Then someone else obviously did.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.685
Someone close to powell.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.787
And rowe recently converted
a lot of money from bitcoin,

19:16.789 --> 19:19.257
The preferred currency
of cyber criminals everywhere.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.626
Rowe did make
a quick exit

19:21.628 --> 19:23.394
Once powell started
talking about the daemon.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.163
Callen:
Talk to powell.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.397
Find out if his lawyer knew
about the daemon before today.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.431
Kensi:
Got it.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.167
Done.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.202
G...

19:31.204 --> 19:32.336
We can't just
shut down flibbit

19:32.338 --> 19:34.338
Based on the word
of a suspected murderer

19:34.340 --> 19:35.873
And a doctored résumé.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.942
We need to go undercover.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.150
Eric:
Uh, guys, guys...

19:46.151 --> 19:48.418
Hey, if I can just, um, put
in a little plug for myself.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.354
Um, I'm an expert coder,
I know the language,

19:50.356 --> 19:51.839
I'm already dressed
for the part.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.323
There is literally no one
more qualified for this mission.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.492
Yep. There is one problem.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.493
Yeah, there's,
there's no problem.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.494
Don't-don't listen to her.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.862
I am your guy.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.297
Put me in, coach.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.331
Nell:
Flibbit isn't
hiring coders.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.768
In fact,
they're not hiring anyone.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.403
I'm sorry, mr. Beale.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.406
But I'm afraid
I must agree with ms. Jones.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.941
But, hetty...
They have a slide.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.809
Hetty:
The only way we
get in flibbit

20:11.811 --> 20:13.511
Is exactly
what got

20:13.513 --> 20:15.947
Mr. Overson through the door.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.316
Money.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.850
A lot of it.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.519
Gentlemen, prepare to make

20:21.521 --> 20:25.223
The fastest billion in history.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.291
That greedy bastard.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.894
Why didn't I think of it?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.561
So you discussed the daemon
with your lawyer?

20:31.564 --> 20:34.699
During my overguard
lawsuit two years ago,

20:34.701 --> 20:36.701
Rowe and I were looking
to discredit larry.

20:36.703 --> 20:37.969
I mentioned it.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.470
Kensi:
Mentioning doesn't

20:39.472 --> 20:41.339
Give rowe access to a powerful

20:41.341 --> 20:42.940
Computer code, though.
No.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.475
But giving him access

20:44.477 --> 20:46.344
To all my computer files
for the suit does.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.345
Deeks:
Wait a minute.
So the daemon

20:47.347 --> 20:48.679
Was still in your files?

20:48.681 --> 20:50.514
Why wouldn't
you wipe that?

20:50.516 --> 20:51.983
It was stupid,

20:51.985 --> 20:53.551
I know, but I...

20:55.788 --> 20:57.488
I was proud of it.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.757
I never would have
sold the daemon,

20:59.759 --> 21:01.525
But that didn't mean
I couldn't admire it.

21:01.527 --> 21:02.893
Eric:
Kens.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.895
Eric, we're gonna need
a location on wilson rowe.

21:04.897 --> 21:05.896
Copy.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.565
¶ ¶

21:07.567 --> 21:10.268
(whirring)

21:10.270 --> 21:11.836
(crashes)
who put a desk here?

21:11.838 --> 21:13.804
Huh?

21:13.806 --> 21:15.439
Did... Did you put
this desk here?

21:15.441 --> 21:17.908
I'm just...
Look. It's called
an "open floor plan"

21:17.910 --> 21:20.611
Because there needs to be
a clear path from the entrance

21:20.613 --> 21:21.646
To the bullpen.

21:21.648 --> 21:22.947
Is that a slide?

21:22.949 --> 21:24.982
I love this slide.
Almost makes up for the desk.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.934
But you still got to move it.

21:26.935 --> 21:28.885
Um... Okay, I'll try,
but here's the thing...
Now.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.421
Miles, stop.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.023
Austin:
Can I help you?
Ignore him.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.591
We're here to meet
jessica moore.

21:33.593 --> 21:34.825
Is she expecting you?

21:34.827 --> 21:37.061
"is she expecting you?"
who-who are you?

21:37.063 --> 21:39.430
That's austin chopra,
flibbit's lead programmer.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.365
You said
he did good work.
I did say that.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.600
I did say that.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.568
We want to meet with you,
too, austin.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.537
I'm samuel wright.
This is curtis williams.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.039
Please tell jessica

21:48.041 --> 21:49.707
That we want nothing more

21:49.709 --> 21:52.009
Than to see her company
rival snapchat,

21:52.011 --> 21:54.812
And we've got the cash
that can make it happen.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.947
I'd like to ride the slide.

21:58.518 --> 22:01.018
Nice! Flibbit's checking out
callen and sam.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.554
Eric:
How much money
did you backstop them?

22:03.556 --> 22:05.323
Uh, just under
a billion dollars.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.957
You think that
should be enough, right?

22:07.927 --> 22:09.527
Yeah.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.796
Yeah, that should be enough.

22:11.798 --> 22:15.599
See, the tricky part was making
callen and sam impressive,

22:15.601 --> 22:17.735
But not so impressive
that flibbit goes,

22:17.737 --> 22:19.870
"hey, why have we never heard
of these guys?"

22:19.872 --> 22:23.774
So I tapped into an
oversaturated yet popular market

22:23.776 --> 22:25.343
With the coders.

22:25.345 --> 22:28.045
Check it out.

22:29.415 --> 22:31.549
You invented
an energy drink?
No, no.

22:31.551 --> 22:32.583
Callen and sam did.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.919
Oh. Right.
It's not yet legal

22:34.921 --> 22:38.489
In the states, but it's
taking eastern europe by storm.

22:38.491 --> 22:41.559
(groans)
geez, what's going on
back there, macgyver?

22:41.561 --> 22:43.594
(sighs) all right,
all right. Sorry.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.931
All done.
I am now officially...

22:46.933 --> 22:48.566
Air-gapped.

22:48.568 --> 22:51.469
(sighs)
I am no longer connected
to any ncis servers.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.471
Now I can analyze
the flibbit app

22:53.473 --> 22:55.740
Without worrying
about that pesky daemon.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.541
Nice, beale.
Yeah.

22:57.543 --> 23:00.644
If it's there,
I'm gonna find it.
(laughs)

23:00.646 --> 23:03.080
Nell:
Whoa. Just got a hit

23:03.082 --> 23:04.548
On our lawyer's porsche.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.518
Wilson rowe is in venice.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.987
I'll tell kensi and deeks.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.423
It's nice to
meet you...

23:12.425 --> 23:13.724
Mr. Wright?
Sam wright.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.526
Mr. Williams.
How you doing?

23:15.528 --> 23:17.528
Good. I just wish you'd
given us some warning.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.963
Well, we like
to arrive unannounced

23:18.965 --> 23:21.031
So we can see the business
in its natural,

23:21.033 --> 23:22.733
Undisturbed state.
Well, not that we

23:22.735 --> 23:25.669
Don't welcome your interest,
but I assume you heard

23:25.671 --> 23:27.838
About larry overson?
We did,

23:27.840 --> 23:30.574
And we have no intention of
taking advantage of a tragedy.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.877
Oh, no, I didn't mean it
like that. I...

23:32.879 --> 23:34.578
But, to be blunt--

23:34.580 --> 23:36.414
May he rest in peace--

23:36.416 --> 23:38.115
Larry was a start-up guy.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.750
Definitely a needle mover,

23:39.752 --> 23:42.620
But the kind of guy
that would take a company

23:42.622 --> 23:45.589
From, say, zero to 30 mil
in under a year.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.425
Callen:
Flibbit's not a
start-up anymore.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.994
The way we see it,
you need guys that can take it

23:49.996 --> 23:53.497
From zero to 60, 80, 200 mph.

23:53.499 --> 23:54.698
That's us.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.634
We break
the needle off.

23:56.636 --> 23:57.868
Off.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.938
That, uh...
All sounds great.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.543
May I speak with you a moment?

24:05.545 --> 24:07.611
Excuse me.
Callen: Sure.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.117
You knew larry.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.119
You don't know us.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.688
We understand
that, jessica.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.924
But you and I aren't
that different.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.660
In fact, we're
very much alike.

24:22.662 --> 24:26.564
Now, when curtis and I walk
into a room, in this industry,

24:26.566 --> 24:28.666
Who do you think
they automatically

24:28.668 --> 24:31.635
Assume is in charge?

24:31.637 --> 24:33.904
Who do they try
to impress?

24:33.906 --> 24:35.773
It's not the black guy.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.743
Just this week,
I met with about

24:39.745 --> 24:41.612
A dozen companies.

24:41.614 --> 24:44.615
You're the first woman
at the table.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.785
You're also the
most successful.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.222
When they look at you,

24:51.224 --> 24:53.257
They see easy money.

24:53.259 --> 24:55.192
When I look at you,

24:55.194 --> 24:58.496
I see someone
just like me.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.698
Someone who worked hard...

25:00.700 --> 25:03.601
To get all of this.

25:03.603 --> 25:07.271
And we intend to honor that
by working just as hard.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.810
So, where do we start?
I'd like to take a look
at the product.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.778
Of course. We have a big update
coming out tonight.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.280
Very exciting.
Austin, will you show them?

25:16.282 --> 25:17.515
Happy to.
Great.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.049
See you down below.
All right.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.719
You know, code's not really
my thing, but I'd love a tour.

25:21.721 --> 25:24.121
Uh, follow me.
Okay.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.789
Jessica:
Oh. Vincent.
Uh, this is

25:25.791 --> 25:28.058
Our head of security.
Vincent, sam wright.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.260
Can never have
too much security.

25:29.262 --> 25:30.928
Imagine you guys take in

25:30.930 --> 25:33.597
A lot of sensitive
personal data.
It's in good hands.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.299
Right. With a firm grip.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.601
It's nice to meet you
excuse me.
Nice to meet you, too.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.170
All right.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.772
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

25:41.774 --> 25:44.174
Oh! Beat ya!

25:45.144 --> 25:47.211
¶ ¶

26:01.227 --> 26:03.227
There's our lawyer's car.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.962
Kensi:
And there's our lawyer.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.330
Deeks:
He looks grumpy.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.932
Hmm.
You know
what he needs?

26:07.934 --> 26:09.333
What?
Puppies.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.169
Puppies?
Puppies at a push
of a button.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.305
You're feeling blue,
you pull up the app,

26:14.307 --> 26:15.839
30 minutes later...
(snaps fingers)

26:15.841 --> 26:17.575
You got puppies.
That's your idea?

26:17.577 --> 26:19.009
That's my idea!
It's great, huh?

26:19.011 --> 26:20.711
Already exists.
What, really?
A puppy app?

26:20.713 --> 26:22.713
And kittens.
Already exists.
Seriously?

26:22.715 --> 26:25.683
Mm-hmm.
How about an old dog
with bad flatulence?

26:25.685 --> 26:28.252
'cause monty's available.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.320
(groans)

26:29.322 --> 26:30.621
(gunshot)
deeks.
Get down!

26:30.623 --> 26:32.323
Deeks:
Everybody get down!

26:32.325 --> 26:33.958
Kensi, you see
where that shot came from?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.659
Kensi:
No. Nell, we need backup

26:35.661 --> 26:37.294
And an ambulance--
rowe's been shot.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.363
Son of a bitch!

26:51.210 --> 26:52.943
Deeks:
What do you got, eric?

26:52.945 --> 26:54.979
After rowe left powell

26:54.981 --> 26:56.313
At the boatshed,
he texted someone.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.649
They told him
to meet them at the beach.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.250
Who was rowe on the phone
with when he got shot?

27:00.252 --> 27:01.251
Same number.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.686
But it was scrambled by a pro.

27:02.688 --> 27:03.687
I can't trace it.

27:03.689 --> 27:04.822
So after he spoke
to powell,

27:04.824 --> 27:06.156
Rowe must have
started to suspect

27:06.158 --> 27:08.859
That whoever he sold
the daemon to killed overson.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.928
Yeah, but in that case,
you don't call the killer.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.396
That's like painting
a target on your back.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.898
Unless rowe
had overson shot.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.967
In which case
he knew the killer.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.870
And they don't want him talking
to federal agents. Eric?

27:19.872 --> 27:22.940
Copy. We'll look through rowe's
client list and contacts.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.875
Any luck?
(sighs):
Well, to the west,

27:24.877 --> 27:27.277
It's all ocean, so obviously
the shot came from the east.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.146
Unless you got a shark
with a rifle.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.382
That's funny. Well,
I heard the rifle report

27:31.384 --> 27:33.717
About two seconds
after rowe was hit.

27:33.719 --> 27:36.020
Sound travels
at 332 meters per second.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.921
Your average bullet is
about twice that speed.

27:37.923 --> 27:40.190
God, I love it
when you talk math.
So to calculate

27:40.192 --> 27:42.192
The distance of the shot,
we have to multiply

27:42.194 --> 27:44.762
Those two speeds
by the two-second time gap,

27:44.764 --> 27:46.664
Mmm, yeah.
Dividing it by the difference

27:46.666 --> 27:49.099
Between those speeds.
I'm right there with you.
What do you got?

27:49.101 --> 27:52.903
I'm looking at a vantage point
of... Just over half a mile.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.104
Whoa.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.739
Like that, through
those buildings.

27:55.741 --> 27:57.374
Deeks:
The flibbit building?

27:57.376 --> 27:58.976
Yep.
Oh, wow.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.377
I'll call sam.
Yeah.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.912
The more I think about it,

28:01.914 --> 28:03.947
I think that should be
just fine, so, um,

28:03.949 --> 28:05.699
Just shoot me something.
Yeah.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.450
Okay, thank you. Remind me
to set a meeting with design...

28:07.453 --> 28:10.020
Kensi: Sam, we think the shot
came from your location.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.255
I'm on it.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.690
Woman:
Okay, I'll remind you.

28:12.692 --> 28:15.859
Um... Did I see
a bathroom back this way?

28:15.861 --> 28:18.062
Oh, yeah, right
near the end.

28:18.064 --> 28:20.130
Oh, thank you.
Sure.

28:23.102 --> 28:26.003
Sam: Nell, what's the head
of security's location?

28:26.005 --> 28:27.838
Okay, I'm pulling up
the tracker data.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.306
He's on the roof, sam.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.075
I'm sending you the info now.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.781
(beep, lock clunks)

28:42.388 --> 28:45.322
(both grunting)

28:57.870 --> 28:59.136
Stay there!

28:59.138 --> 29:00.504
Put your hands on your head!

29:01.941 --> 29:04.041
You are not
a venture capital investor.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.909
You're not a security guard.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.978
You didn't learn to fight
like that in the gym.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.346
Start talking.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.181
That's not how we operate.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.784
You might as well
just shoot me.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.353
That's not how<i> we</i> operate.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.989
Where's your weapon?

29:18.991 --> 29:20.824
You already have my gun.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.159
Your sniper rifle--

29:22.161 --> 29:23.393
Where is it?

29:23.395 --> 29:25.462
Sniper rifle?

29:33.105 --> 29:35.773
You weren't on the roof
20 minutes ago.

29:35.775 --> 29:37.508
You couldn't have
taken the shot.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.843
Who was shot?

29:39.845 --> 29:41.278
You want me to answer
your questions,

29:41.280 --> 29:43.046
You better start
by answering mine.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.083
Who are you?

29:47.353 --> 29:49.253
My name is noam haber,

29:49.255 --> 29:50.854
Israeli mossad.

29:50.856 --> 29:52.990
What the hell are you doing
on u.S. Soil?

29:52.992 --> 29:54.124
Get up!

29:56.428 --> 29:58.061
I'm tracking an undercover agent

29:58.063 --> 30:00.264
For pakistan's
inter-services intelligence.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.566
We believe he's responsible
for cyber attacks

30:02.568 --> 30:04.401
Against israel.

30:04.403 --> 30:07.938
20 minutes ago, the rooftop
security cameras went out.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.940
I came up to check.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.942
I thought you lured me here.

30:11.944 --> 30:14.311
Do I look pakistani to you?

30:15.514 --> 30:17.514
I'm ncis.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.216
You and me are supposed
to be on the same side.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.918
Keep your hands up.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.219
Who's the isi agent?

30:22.221 --> 30:24.521
Austin chopra, lead programmer.

30:24.523 --> 30:27.457
Chopra's been with my partner
the entire time.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.860
Means he could have a partner.

30:29.862 --> 30:33.497
And this...
Is flibbit in the raw.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.365
Ah, that's beautiful.

30:35.367 --> 30:36.567
Eric:
Okay.

30:36.569 --> 30:38.101
Callen, for me
to access their system,

30:38.103 --> 30:39.436
I need you to get your phone

30:39.438 --> 30:41.338
As close to the processor
as you can.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.574
You know what?

30:43.576 --> 30:45.409
I got to instagram this.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.511
Let's make this selfie
an "ussie."

30:47.513 --> 30:49.246
I'm sorry, I can't let you
post a photo of that.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.481
It's confidential.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.383
They're not nuclear codes.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.152
Sorry.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.554
Okay.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.456
No photos.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.426
Guess I know who the fun one
around here is.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.428
Eric:
I'm in.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.532
(computer beeps)
(groans)

31:08.534 --> 31:10.634
It looks like he's only
showing you the bare minimum.

31:10.636 --> 31:13.070
I'm gonna have
to dig a little deeper.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.371
You sure this
is everything?

31:14.373 --> 31:15.572
It's my code.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.541
I'm sure.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.409
I'd like to take it
home to review it.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.612
I'm sorry.
I can't let you do that, either.

31:21.614 --> 31:25.148
Did larry overson
get this kind of treatment?

31:25.150 --> 31:27.017
(sighs)

31:27.019 --> 31:28.585
If jessica made an exception
for larry,

31:28.587 --> 31:30.254
You'd have to talk to her
about that.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.322
Talk to me about what?

31:32.324 --> 31:35.392
Um, seem to have lost your
colleague. Have you seen him?

31:35.394 --> 31:37.160
Sam:
Right here.

31:37.162 --> 31:39.496
Had to make another call.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.999
We have a problem
in our beverage factory.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.334
We need to go.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.470
Thank you for letting us
poke around.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.171
We'll be in touch.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.073
You dropped
this upstairs.

31:55.514 --> 31:58.615
Nell:
This is isi agent austin chopra.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.285
From the security footage
provided by the mossad agent,

32:01.287 --> 32:04.154
We've identified one other
potential isi agent

32:04.156 --> 32:05.589
Inside flibbit.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.025
Batool shah, another programmer,

32:08.027 --> 32:09.593
Who was close to the
rooftop stairwell

32:09.595 --> 32:11.128
Prior to rowe's
murder.

32:11.130 --> 32:14.231
Now, her flibbit account
is filled with posts

32:14.233 --> 32:15.666
About her love of the keytar.

32:15.668 --> 32:17.567
Kensi:
A dismantled rifle
would fit nicely

32:17.569 --> 32:20.337
Into that case.
Deeks: It's a brilliant cover.
I guarantee

32:20.339 --> 32:22.539
No one's ever asked her
to bust out her keytar.

32:22.541 --> 32:23.607
Nell:
Shah also

32:23.609 --> 32:25.976
Used to work for babur jilani,

32:25.978 --> 32:27.511
A pakistani businessman

32:27.513 --> 32:30.614
And former client
of the late wilson rowe.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.483
So rowe sells
the daemon to jilani,

32:33.485 --> 32:36.053
Whose business is an isi front.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.221
Isi activates their network,
they code it into the app.

32:38.223 --> 32:39.656
Nell: See, that's
the odd part.

32:39.658 --> 32:42.392
Eric analyzed the app this
afternoon, and he couldn't find

32:42.394 --> 32:44.011
The daemon anywhere.

32:44.012 --> 32:45.629
That's because it wasn't
in the app this afternoon.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.965
It wasn't even in the code
they showed callen,

32:47.967 --> 32:50.534
But I was able to dig deeper,
and I found it.

32:50.536 --> 32:54.571
The daemon is in flibbit's
automatic app update.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.039
The one scheduled tonight?

32:56.041 --> 32:57.474
Except they jumped the gun.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.610
It started uploading
to users' phones 20 minutes ago.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.579
So what does that mean exactly?

33:02.581 --> 33:04.114
Well, while I was in the system,

33:04.115 --> 33:05.648
I managed to pull a list
of flibbit's users,

33:05.651 --> 33:07.584
All 23 million.

33:07.586 --> 33:11.688
Some of them are senators,
ceos, active military.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.473
Isi could use that data

33:13.474 --> 33:15.257
To blackmail politicians,
force policy change.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.594
Steal inside information.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.162
Crash the market.

33:19.164 --> 33:21.164
Hetty: Or sell
our troop movements

33:21.166 --> 33:24.668
To terrorist groups
around the world.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.604
If we don't stop this data flow,

33:27.606 --> 33:31.608
We could be looking
at a disaster

33:31.610 --> 33:33.677
Of international proportions.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.525
Granger:
We know that the government
and military officials

33:48.527 --> 33:50.660
Who use the app have
been compromised.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.662
The data the daemon
is stealing will be stored

33:52.664 --> 33:54.197
On flibbit's on-site servers.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.266
Once they isolate
the valuable intel,

33:56.268 --> 33:58.268
They'll need to get it
back to isi.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.271
They wouldn't take a chance
sending it over a network.

34:01.273 --> 34:02.739
So they'd need to
send it physically.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.142
Eric: External hard drive
would do the trick.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.443
We've been monitoring
the building,

34:06.445 --> 34:08.145
And fortunately no one's
left since the update.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.613
Granger: We need
to secure the data

34:09.615 --> 34:11.281
Before they hand it
over to pakistan.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.616
Sam:
And we got to deal

34:12.618 --> 34:13.683
With the two isi agents.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.118
Yeah, at the
very least.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.753
Those two agents
didn't even raise a red flag

34:16.755 --> 34:18.155
When we did
our initial background.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.389
There very well could be more.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.624
Kensi: But most
of the employees

34:20.626 --> 34:22.626
Are innocent,
so if we go in weapons hot,

34:22.628 --> 34:24.678
It could get messy.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.729
Well, we got a man
on the inside-- haber.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.665
We don't usually get much
cooperation from mossad,

34:28.667 --> 34:30.634
But they've confirmed
haber is one of theirs.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.803
And I think israel
hates isi enough

34:32.805 --> 34:34.604
To put tradecraft aside
for one night.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.673
Callen: We get haber to
set off the fire alarm,

34:36.675 --> 34:38.675
Innocent employees
should evacuate.

34:38.677 --> 34:42.345
Isi agents will stay
to protect the data.

34:42.347 --> 34:44.214
Granger: Send haber
a message with the plan.
Yeah.

34:44.216 --> 34:47.717
And don't let that data
out of the building.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.219
¶ ¶

34:53.192 --> 34:54.524
Callen:
We're here, eric.

34:54.526 --> 34:56.827
Fire alarm should
have gone off by now.

34:56.829 --> 34:59.162
Nell:
Nothing yet.

34:59.164 --> 35:01.832
We're watching security
footage from flibbit.

35:01.834 --> 35:03.500
Haber is nowhere
to be seen.

35:03.502 --> 35:04.501
We can't wait.

35:04.503 --> 35:05.802
You need to secure
that data.

35:07.739 --> 35:08.872
Where are you going?

35:08.874 --> 35:10.807
Plan b.

35:24.123 --> 35:25.689
(siren wailing)
now we're a go.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.791
Deeks: Plan b,
smoke grenade. I like it.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.860
(alarm wailing)

35:32.831 --> 35:34.197
Sam:
On your knees!

35:34.198 --> 35:35.564
On your knees!
Hands on your head!

35:35.567 --> 35:37.734
Callen: Federal agents!
Sam: On your knees!

35:37.736 --> 35:38.869
Hands on your head!
What is going on?!

35:38.871 --> 35:39.870
Hands on your head!

35:39.872 --> 35:41.471
(alarm stops)
fire alarm is off.

35:43.775 --> 35:44.875
Sam:
Don't move.

35:44.877 --> 35:46.309
She's good.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.578
Get down!

35:48.580 --> 35:50.413
(rapid gunfire)

35:56.421 --> 35:57.888
Let me see your hands!
Let...

35:57.890 --> 35:59.156
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Let me see your hands!

35:59.158 --> 36:02.792
Jessica (screams):
My god! Miles!

36:02.794 --> 36:04.861
Clear!
Sam: Server's
on the second floor.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.463
Callen:
Stay with jessica.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.532
¶ ¶

36:19.645 --> 36:21.178
Don't move.

36:23.782 --> 36:26.183
So sorry your friend
didn't get the message.

36:26.185 --> 36:28.185
But once I caught him
exporting security footage

36:28.187 --> 36:29.519
To an outside ip address...

36:29.521 --> 36:31.221
You released the update early.

36:31.223 --> 36:32.889
You got to adapt
to survive.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.691
All bubbles eventually
burst, right?

36:34.693 --> 36:35.959
You're about to find
that out firsthand.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.928
You come any closer,
I'll kill him.

36:37.930 --> 36:39.729
We got men downstairs--
you're not going anywhere.

36:42.201 --> 36:43.266
Take him!

36:54.846 --> 36:57.314
¶ ¶

37:16.435 --> 37:18.501
¶ ¶

37:21.940 --> 37:23.873
So your lawyer sold the daemon

37:23.875 --> 37:26.810
To a pakistani businessman
by the name of babur jilani.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.478
Who actually
works for isi.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.814
And we took out three
of their agents inside flibbit.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.482
Wow.

37:32.484 --> 37:33.984
So larry was right.

37:33.986 --> 37:37.988
And he paid for it
with his life.

37:37.990 --> 37:39.656
So, um, does...

37:39.658 --> 37:42.325
Does the nsa still want
to press charges against me

37:42.327 --> 37:44.361
For hiding the daemon?

37:44.363 --> 37:45.962
That's actually gonna be
the least of your problems.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.631
Kensi: You see,
the thing is,

37:47.633 --> 37:49.633
Those isi agents
were nowhere near

37:49.635 --> 37:51.334
Overson's boat last night.

37:51.336 --> 37:53.670
Maybe there were
more than three.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.005
Deeks:
Maybe.

37:55.007 --> 37:56.706
Or maybe you threw

37:56.708 --> 37:57.907
Overson's laptop
into the marina.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.709
And maybe
the coast guard

37:59.711 --> 38:01.544
Fished it out
a couple hours ago.

38:01.546 --> 38:02.779
Kensi:
And maybe overson

38:02.781 --> 38:03.847
Waterproofed his hard drive.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.015
Deeks:
Because he did use it

38:05.017 --> 38:06.416
In a boat after all.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.784
Kensi: And our people
were successful

38:07.786 --> 38:09.586
At pulling
his security video.

38:09.588 --> 38:12.422
Deeks:
Well, look at that.

38:12.424 --> 38:13.623
Are you kidding me?!

38:13.625 --> 38:14.691
(grunting)

38:14.693 --> 38:15.925
Let's get out of here, man!

38:15.927 --> 38:18.695
(grunting continues)

38:22.934 --> 38:25.468
Kensi: And when we searched
your lawyer's office,

38:25.470 --> 38:28.571
We found that he'd kept
secret recordings--

38:28.573 --> 38:31.941
Discussions with you
about how to sell the daemon.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.444
Pretty fantastic plan, really--
you're cooperative,

38:34.446 --> 38:36.012
Having us chase isi
around all day long.

38:36.014 --> 38:38.048
Kensi:
And telling us

38:38.049 --> 38:40.083
Just the right amount of truth
to hide the lies.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.385
And yet here we are.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.060
I knew that we were selling
the daemon to isi,

38:50.062 --> 38:52.595
But I didn't know what they
were gonna do with it,

38:52.597 --> 38:55.565
That it would end
up at flibbit.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.567
(sighs)

38:57.569 --> 39:01.571
Of course the great
larry overson had to find it,

39:01.573 --> 39:03.907
Had to ruin it.

39:03.909 --> 39:06.409
As if he already hadn't
ruined my life enough.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.546
(chuckles)

39:09.548 --> 39:12.549
In one more month,

39:12.551 --> 39:15.685
I would have started to see
some of the money from the sale.

39:18.090 --> 39:20.824
One more month,
and I would have been gone.

39:25.597 --> 39:29.399
So you, uh, swinging by
joelle's again tonight?

39:29.401 --> 39:32.402
Did you find something
else to return to her?

39:32.404 --> 39:34.738
This is still a thing
for you, isn't it?

39:34.740 --> 39:36.406
I know you said
you let her go,

39:36.408 --> 39:38.742
But you were with
joelle two years.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.910
That's not nothing, g.
No.

39:42.447 --> 39:44.147
No, it's not.

39:47.052 --> 39:51.654
Look, maybe I was... Jealous.

39:52.591 --> 39:56.025
Garret odell,
I mean, he's...

39:56.027 --> 39:57.660
He's a handsome guy.

39:57.662 --> 40:01.998
He's got a kid, which I know
joelle wants, and...

40:02.000 --> 40:03.533
I guess I thought

40:03.535 --> 40:06.636
That maybe at some point
I might be...

40:06.638 --> 40:08.471
The guy.

40:09.441 --> 40:10.974
I even bought
a ring.

40:12.944 --> 40:15.078
I had the whole thing
planned out.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.814
This restaurant
that we'd always go to...
All right, stop.

40:17.816 --> 40:20.450
Are you done telling me what
you think I want to hear?

40:20.452 --> 40:22.118
What do you want
to hear, sam?

40:22.120 --> 40:25.422
I just want to hear you're
good and you have no regrets.

40:26.825 --> 40:31.628
Of course I've got regrets.
Joelle is amazing, but...

40:31.630 --> 40:33.630
She's just not right for me.

40:36.067 --> 40:38.802
Doesn't mean someone else
out there isn't.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.071
Well, it doesn't mean
that I'm looking.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.174
Need a ride home?

40:44.176 --> 40:46.176
I drove my car,
remember?

40:46.178 --> 40:48.178
Ah, you can drive
your car tomorrow.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.146
We've wasted all day
talking about this thing.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.048
I mean, you know, we
didn't get a chance

40:52.050 --> 40:53.183
To talk about
anything else.

40:53.185 --> 40:55.452
What else do we have
to talk about?

40:55.454 --> 40:58.655
You know what, take
your own damn car home.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.807
What else we have
to talk about?
Nothing.

41:00.808 --> 41:02.958
Callen: You want to guess
what color I'm thinking again?
Sam: Translucent.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.128
Callen: I'll give you a hint.
Sam: I don't want a hint.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.729
Sam:
I don't need a hint.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.599
Pakistan is denying

41:09.601 --> 41:13.736
That the people we took down
are agents of isi.

41:13.738 --> 41:17.073
I would expect
nothing less.

41:17.075 --> 41:20.543
But they're still in
possession of the daemon.

41:22.948 --> 41:25.548
And now so are we,
as we should have been

41:25.550 --> 41:27.917
As soon as powell
and overson created it.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.056
Anyway, now that we know
what to look for,

41:33.058 --> 41:36.593
We can stop the daemon
from being used as a weapon.

41:36.595 --> 41:40.063
Until the next new
thing comes along

41:40.065 --> 41:44.934
And we start the fight
all over again.

41:44.936 --> 41:48.738
Granger:<i> Don't pretend</i>
<i> you don't love it, henrietta.</i>
