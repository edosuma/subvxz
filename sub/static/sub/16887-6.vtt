00:00.147 --> 00:01.919
Hey, I'm Chuck.
<i>Here's a couple of things</i>

00:01.987 --> 00:03.827
<i>that you might need to know</i>
<i>or maybe you just forgot.</i>

00:03.895 --> 00:05.567
So, do you have a girlfriend?

00:05.635 --> 00:07.675
I did a while back at Stanford.

00:07.743 --> 00:09.683
Oh.
- Yeah  her name was Jill.

00:09.751 --> 00:10.888
We met freshmen year.

00:10.955 --> 00:12.729
We had so much in common then.

00:12.797 --> 00:13.698
Bryce Larkin.

00:13.767 --> 00:15.372
Dude pretended to be his buddy

00:15.441 --> 00:18.016
<i>sexed up his girl and got him</i>
<i>kicked out of Stanford.</i>

00:18.084 --> 00:19.020
Stanford was five years ago.

00:19.088 --> 00:20.292
You need to move on.

00:20.359 --> 00:22.132
Fine, I'll get over Jill tomorrow.

# #

00:36.724 --> 00:38.027
Hey, Chuck!

00:38.096 --> 00:39.299
That's the dude that got

00:39.367 --> 00:40.571
kicked out for cheating.

00:40.639 --> 00:43.583
Yeah, I didn't cheat,
actually, it's...

00:51.180 --> 00:52.585
Oh! Hey, I'm just--

00:52.652 --> 00:54.023
If you guys don't mind,
I'm just gonna borrow these.

00:54.091 --> 00:55.262
Continue with your game.

00:55.330 --> 00:56.366
Gonna have to turn
this off, too.

00:56.434 --> 00:58.842
Jill!

01:00.014 --> 01:01.285
(grunts)

01:01.353 --> 01:01.821
Come on.

01:02.859 --> 01:04.330
Jill! Hey!

01:04.397 --> 01:05.400
It's Chuck. Please,

01:05.468 --> 01:07.241
I-I want a chance

01:07.310 --> 01:09.283
to explain my side face-to-face.

01:11.058 --> 01:12.563
If Jill wanted
to speak to you

01:12.630 --> 01:15.340
she would have returned
one of your 28 phone calls.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.947
Hi, Shari.

01:18.152 --> 01:19.121
Is she up there?

01:19.189 --> 01:21.966
(scoffs)

01:22.034 --> 01:24.978
Jill...

01:25.045 --> 01:26.718
I, uh,

01:26.785 --> 01:28.190
I was on break at-at work.

01:28.259 --> 01:30.164
I'm actually working
at a Buy More.

01:30.232 --> 01:32.039
Of all places, yeah.

01:32.107 --> 01:33.478
And I drove, you know,

01:33.545 --> 01:37.125
346 miles straight
from Burbank

01:37.193 --> 01:41.710
to see you and to tell you
that I still love you.

01:41.778 --> 01:43.918
(light laughter)

01:43.986 --> 01:45.692
BOY:
Loser!

01:48.337 --> 01:50.444
Chuck!

01:50.511 --> 01:51.950
Hey, hey, Jill!

01:52.018 --> 01:54.092
Hey, um, I think

01:54.159 --> 01:57.170
I've thoroughly publicly
embarrassed myself enough,

01:57.238 --> 02:00.550
so you think maybe we could go
talk over some coffee

02:00.618 --> 02:01.688
or something like that?

02:01.756 --> 02:04.164
It's too late, Chuck. It's over.

02:04.232 --> 02:05.704
When you say "it's over,"

02:05.772 --> 02:07.745
you mean, like, this
conversation's over, right?

02:07.813 --> 02:09.317
To be continued
at the Starbucks?

02:09.384 --> 02:12.865
She's dating Bryce Larkin
now, Chuck.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.672
Bryce...

02:14.740 --> 02:15.876
Deal with it.

02:15.945 --> 02:17.550
BOY:
I told you he was a loser.

02:19.257 --> 02:21.298
Is that true?

02:21.365 --> 02:23.406
# #

02:25.047 --> 02:26.954
I'm sorry, Chuck.

02:29.464 --> 02:31.002
# #

02:37.763 --> 02:39.435
(bell dings)

02:39.503 --> 02:42.681
Oh, I hate to disturb
your reverie there, Chuck.

02:42.750 --> 02:45.090
I'm going to need you

02:45.159 --> 02:46.564
to get down to the
Sheraton Conference Center

02:46.631 --> 02:47.634
for a tech-support call.

02:47.702 --> 02:48.872
<i>Pronto.</i>

02:48.941 --> 02:50.746
Sure thing, Emmet.

02:50.814 --> 02:52.353
Got any Boston cream in there?

02:52.421 --> 02:54.160
Oh, yeah, several.

02:58.778 --> 03:00.551
Ah...

03:00.620 --> 03:02.425
Why, Emmet, you shouldn't have.

03:02.493 --> 03:03.731
(laughs)

03:03.798 --> 03:06.608
Oh, they just look delicious.

03:11.261 --> 03:13.268
(guttural choking)

03:13.336 --> 03:16.146
(choking continues)

03:16.213 --> 03:17.685
Oh, my God.

03:19.493 --> 03:21.767
You breathing?

03:21.835 --> 03:23.575
(gasping)

03:23.643 --> 03:26.319
Try to relax.
Try to relax.

03:26.387 --> 03:27.590
Oh, my God!

03:28.695 --> 03:30.736
Help! This man's dying!

03:30.804 --> 03:34.217
(grunting)

03:34.284 --> 03:36.291
No, no, Emmet, Emmet, you're
doing it wrong-- you're supposed

03:36.359 --> 03:37.964
to hold his mouth open,
reach down and grab it.

03:38.033 --> 03:39.036
(loud grunting)

03:42.918 --> 03:44.691
Guess that way
works, too.

03:45.862 --> 03:47.535
Are there any more donuts?

03:49.444 --> 03:51.451
CHUCK:
Huh, BioScience conference.

03:51.518 --> 03:53.124
I bet these things
get pretty wild, huh?

03:53.192 --> 03:55.734
All right,o the networks
should now be all set up

03:55.801 --> 03:59.382
with ten-based T Ethernet
connecting all the servers

03:59.449 --> 04:01.724
for the conference
with a firewall in place.

04:11.430 --> 04:12.533
(gasps)

04:13.872 --> 04:14.809
Is there a problem?

04:14.876 --> 04:15.879
Can you tell me

04:15.947 --> 04:17.017
if the attractive brown-eyed,

04:17.084 --> 04:18.623
slightly egg-headed brunette

04:18.690 --> 04:21.200
with an extremely cold heart
is still here?

04:22.506 --> 04:23.743
She's here.

04:23.811 --> 04:25.249
Why? Who is she?

04:25.317 --> 04:27.056
Jill Roberts, my ex-girlfriend.
She broke my heart.

04:27.125 --> 04:29.834
I need, I need a diversion.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.440
Would it be
a terrible imposition

04:31.508 --> 04:33.046
for you to pull
the fire alarm?

04:33.114 --> 04:35.322
Hi, I'm Dr. Jill Roberts.
Is there someone

04:35.390 --> 04:37.497
that can help me with the tech
requirements for my lecture?

04:37.565 --> 04:38.601
MAN:
Under the desk.

04:38.669 --> 04:39.840
What?

04:42.016 --> 04:43.453
Hi.

04:43.521 --> 04:44.993
Chuck?

04:45.061 --> 04:46.198
Ah!

04:46.968 --> 04:50.012
It was the flange just there.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.485
Chuck Bartowski.

04:51.553 --> 04:52.958
Present.

04:53.025 --> 04:54.664
Yes, that's me.

04:54.732 --> 04:56.873
It's me, Jill.

04:56.941 --> 04:59.383
Jill, oh, my gosh! Of course!

04:59.451 --> 05:00.654
Yes.

05:00.723 --> 05:02.495
Hi.
- Hi.

05:02.563 --> 05:03.599
Hey, you!

05:03.667 --> 05:05.105
How are you?!
- Good.

05:05.173 --> 05:07.950
So good to...
see you.

05:08.018 --> 05:09.890
You, too.
How long has it been?

05:09.958 --> 05:12.032
Five years, four months-ish,

05:12.100 --> 05:14.274
give or take, kind of
in that neighborhood.

05:14.342 --> 05:16.717
Uh, what have you been up to?

05:16.785 --> 05:17.956
Uh, well, after Stanford,

05:18.023 --> 05:20.030
I got my PhD in biomedical
engineering.

05:20.098 --> 05:21.436
Did you?

05:21.503 --> 05:23.042
Yeah. I'm giving a presentation
at the conference

05:23.110 --> 05:24.180
on infectious diseases.

05:24.247 --> 05:25.452
Lovely.

05:25.519 --> 05:26.522
And you?

05:26.590 --> 05:28.028
And me.

05:28.096 --> 05:29.233
And me.

05:29.301 --> 05:30.973
Uh-uh still in the computer
game, you know?

05:31.041 --> 05:33.951
Yeah, I-I-I work my own,
my own little,

05:34.020 --> 05:35.356
little-little company.

05:35.425 --> 05:37.967
16, 17-- I can't remember which--
stores.

05:38.035 --> 05:40.476
But every once
in a while

05:40.545 --> 05:42.484
I like to do the installs
myself, you know,

05:42.552 --> 05:44.426
don the uni, kind of
get my hands mussy.

05:44.493 --> 05:45.831
I'm really happy
for you, Chuck.

05:45.899 --> 05:47.906
The-the last time
I saw you were--

05:47.973 --> 05:49.880
you were working
at a Buy More.

05:49.948 --> 05:51.018
Ah!

05:51.086 --> 05:53.595
That was a wonderful
growing experience.

05:53.663 --> 05:55.267
Really, really
character building.

05:55.336 --> 05:56.974
And I wouldn't-- wouldn't
change it for the world.

05:57.043 --> 05:58.279
Well...

05:58.347 --> 06:00.287
there's definitely some
things I would change.

06:00.355 --> 06:03.433
Especially about us.

06:03.501 --> 06:05.742
MAN:
There you are.

06:05.810 --> 06:07.047
We're running late.
- Oh.

06:07.115 --> 06:09.390
Guy, this is
my old friend

06:09.458 --> 06:11.264
Chuck Bartowski--
Chuck, this is my boss

06:11.331 --> 06:12.234
Guy LeFleur.

06:12.302 --> 06:14.509
Hi. Nice to meet you.

06:14.578 --> 06:16.785
I work with germs,
so, you know.

06:24.014 --> 06:25.653
I'm sure your friend's busy.

06:25.721 --> 06:27.795
Has, uh, computers to fix.

06:27.863 --> 06:28.899
Shall we?
- Sure.

06:31.344 --> 06:34.019
Chuck, I'm staying at
the Hotel Waldron,

06:34.088 --> 06:36.530
so give me a call if you want
to grab a cup of coffee.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.106
Yeah, uh, well, you know,
I'm busy.

06:39.174 --> 06:40.779
I'll check
with my people.

06:40.847 --> 06:42.687
(chuckles)

06:43.992 --> 06:46.033
<i>Your ex-girlfriend's boss,</i>

06:46.100 --> 06:49.446
Guy LeFleur, is the head
research scientist

06:49.514 --> 06:52.190
for the European company
Cole-MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

06:52.258 --> 06:54.031
And my six has reports

06:54.099 --> 06:56.541
that he may have developed a
bioweapon which he plans to sell

06:56.609 --> 06:57.813
to the highest bidder.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.418
Is Jill involved?

06:59.486 --> 07:00.690
It's your job to find out,
Chuck.

07:00.758 --> 07:02.832
Casey and Sarah will surveil
Dr. LeFleur.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.576
We need you
to reconnect with Jill.

07:05.644 --> 07:07.116
Find out what she knows
about Guy.

07:07.183 --> 07:08.822
Right, right, right, right.

07:08.890 --> 07:11.633
When you say "reconnect,"
you mean send her an e-mail

07:11.701 --> 07:14.444
or invite her to be
my new FaceBook friend, right?

07:14.512 --> 07:17.121
Call her at her hotel
and make a date.

07:17.189 --> 07:18.895
See if you flash
on anything she says

07:18.963 --> 07:20.267
or anyone you meet.

07:20.335 --> 07:21.873
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, a date

07:21.941 --> 07:23.446
with my ex?
No, General,

07:23.513 --> 07:24.919
that-that is
a terrible idea.

07:24.987 --> 07:25.990
You see, she broke my heart.

07:26.057 --> 07:27.060
She destroyed me.

07:27.128 --> 07:28.734
She took all
of my confidence,

07:28.801 --> 07:30.038
my mojo.

07:30.107 --> 07:31.979
You had mojo?
- I was on my way.

07:32.047 --> 07:33.819
Oh, and by the way,
she slept with Bryce Larkin.

07:33.888 --> 07:35.426
Hmm. Who hasn't?

07:37.100 --> 07:39.777
Look, Chuck, I know
that Jill hurt you,

07:39.844 --> 07:41.751
but maybe seeing her again
will give you the closure

07:41.819 --> 07:42.989
that you've always wanted.

07:43.057 --> 07:45.064
You have done a
lot for the CIA,

07:45.131 --> 07:46.971
and we're gonna make
you look good.

07:47.039 --> 07:48.042
Yeah, look on the bright side.

07:48.110 --> 07:49.481
Now you can get your mojo back.

08:34.070 --> 08:35.575
(bell rings)

08:35.643 --> 08:38.320
As you already know we nearly
lost our dear leader today.

08:38.386 --> 08:40.160
And to what?

08:40.227 --> 08:42.537
One tiny little carb-filled
donut.

08:42.604 --> 08:43.875
Please. We lost Big Mike

08:43.943 --> 08:45.247
to donuts years ago?

08:45.315 --> 08:46.519
(all laugh)

08:46.587 --> 08:48.193
(bell rings)

08:48.260 --> 08:50.201
I shudder to think how people

08:50.268 --> 08:52.578
like you would respond to
an actual catastrophe.

08:52.645 --> 08:55.523
A fire, an earthquake...

08:55.591 --> 08:57.966
An all-out race war.

08:58.034 --> 09:00.242
(laughing)

09:00.309 --> 09:02.150
(coughing)

09:02.217 --> 09:03.890
And that is why Michael
and I have decided

09:03.957 --> 09:05.630
to implement an emergency
preparedness course.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.643
And it just so happens

09:08.711 --> 09:10.684
that one of your colleagues knew
someone willing to teach it.

09:10.752 --> 09:12.759
<i>Buenos dias,</i> class.

09:12.827 --> 09:15.704
Hey, uh, you sure you
want to do this?

09:15.772 --> 09:17.712
I love volunteer work,
Chuck.

09:17.781 --> 09:19.319
Besides,
CPR's a breeze.

09:19.386 --> 09:20.792
A child could learn it.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.632
Well, then maybe
you have a shot.

09:22.701 --> 09:24.239
Uh, hey, everybody,
you're in great hands.

09:24.306 --> 09:25.812
Awesome is who certified me.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.385
You might be certified,
Chuck.

09:27.453 --> 09:29.460
But you still have to take
the test like everyone else.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.536
Let's go, Romeo.

09:31.603 --> 09:33.677
Time for your
big date.

09:33.745 --> 09:37.091
The CIA is shelling out a
lot to make you look good.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.062
Okay, so who's ready to pound
some plastic?

09:45.526 --> 09:46.496
Hey!

09:46.563 --> 09:48.035
Wow.

09:48.103 --> 09:49.106
New suit?

09:49.174 --> 09:50.311
You have a big date?

09:50.379 --> 09:51.717
No big date. Why?

09:51.784 --> 09:53.625
Looks expensive.
- No, no, no, no.

09:53.692 --> 09:55.098
It was cheap.
Yeah, real cheap.

09:55.165 --> 09:56.302
It was on sale.

09:56.370 --> 09:57.808
I had a coupon.
- Uh-huh.

09:57.876 --> 09:59.448
I think it's cute you get
all dressed up for Sarah.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.854
She's lucky.

10:00.922 --> 10:02.294
Hey, sis.

10:02.361 --> 10:04.402
Hmm?
- Um...

10:04.469 --> 10:06.778
do you ever think about your
ex-boyfriend, Doug Wald?

10:06.845 --> 10:08.016
No. Why?

10:08.084 --> 10:09.388
Let's say

10:09.456 --> 10:11.664
totally randomly old Dougie,

10:11.732 --> 10:13.371
you know, you guys ran
into each other

10:13.440 --> 10:15.447
and he asked you out to dinner
to catch up

10:15.514 --> 10:17.388
on old times?
What would you say?

10:17.456 --> 10:20.467
I guess theoretically,
I'd say yes.

10:20.534 --> 10:22.341
I am so glad you said that.
You see,

10:22.409 --> 10:24.817
I-I'm not going out
with Sarah tonight,

10:24.886 --> 10:27.596
I'm actually going out
with Jill.

10:27.664 --> 10:28.901
Jill?! No!

10:28.969 --> 10:30.039
No, no, no!

10:30.107 --> 10:31.445
Absolutely not!

10:31.513 --> 10:32.784
What, what about what you
just said about Doug?

10:32.851 --> 10:34.289
Just forget
what I just said, okay?

10:34.358 --> 10:35.762
There is no scenario
in which you should

10:35.830 --> 10:37.402
be going to dinner
with the girl that dumped you,

10:37.470 --> 10:39.913
broke your heart and slept
with your best friend.

10:39.980 --> 10:41.418
Chuck, you bought a new suit?

10:41.486 --> 10:43.226
I told you, coupon.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.000
Chuck...

10:45.067 --> 10:48.346
look, I'm trying not to be
the overprotective big sister.

10:48.414 --> 10:49.786
You? Never.

10:49.854 --> 10:52.397
It's just that I know
that she hurt you, you know?

10:52.464 --> 10:54.438
I don't want to see you go
through that again.

10:54.506 --> 10:56.881
But...

11:10.036 --> 11:12.712
(rattling, horn beeping)

11:12.780 --> 11:14.519
Sticky clutch.

11:14.587 --> 11:17.297
(chuckling): Remind me to have my
assistant to have that fixed.

11:17.365 --> 11:19.607
I think the valet's
up a little further.

11:19.674 --> 11:21.180
Beautiful night
for a walk, huh?

11:21.248 --> 11:22.552
Shall we?

11:23.690 --> 11:25.697
Okay. Here we go.

11:28.109 --> 11:29.179
Thank you.

11:29.246 --> 11:31.321
Hey, Bartowski.

11:31.389 --> 11:33.028
Welcome.
- Thank you.

11:33.095 --> 11:34.734
Hope you haven't been
waiting long. Right this way.

11:34.802 --> 11:36.106
Hey.

11:36.174 --> 11:37.813
Hello, sir.

11:37.882 --> 11:39.253
Hello. Yeah, hello.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.499
Hi.

11:42.567 --> 11:44.340
Looking good, Mr. Bartowski.

11:44.408 --> 11:45.511
Looking good.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.553
# #

11:47.621 --> 11:49.260
(falsetto voice):
Is everyone in here CIA?

11:49.328 --> 11:50.465
Of course.

12:00.272 --> 12:02.045
# #

12:05.828 --> 12:07.735
Huh, thank you
Jonathan.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.755
Wow, I'm impressed.

12:12.823 --> 12:14.328
It's like you own the place.

12:14.396 --> 12:15.868
No, no, no,
God no.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.374
Just, uh, just an investor.

12:17.441 --> 12:18.646
I mean, what can I say?

12:18.713 --> 12:20.587
I'm a sucker
for a good veal parm.

12:20.655 --> 12:22.628
Good evening,
Mr. Bartowski.

12:22.697 --> 12:24.603
Can I get
you two anything to drink?

12:24.672 --> 12:25.675
The usual perhaps?

12:25.742 --> 12:28.051
A 2000 Les Fiefs de Lagrange.

12:29.825 --> 12:31.397
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

12:32.269 --> 12:33.640
I'm really glad

12:33.708 --> 12:34.812
things turned out
so well for you, Chuck.

12:36.586 --> 12:38.660
Especially after,
you know, what happened.

12:38.729 --> 12:40.836
# #

12:43.279 --> 12:46.224
Yeah, uh... about that.

12:46.292 --> 12:48.098
Um, Jill,

12:48.166 --> 12:50.642
I-I never stole those tests.

12:50.710 --> 12:52.449
Well, uh,
that doesn't matter now.

12:52.518 --> 12:54.323
Sure, it doesn't matter <i>now.</i>

12:54.391 --> 12:57.369
You know, now that I drive
a fine Italian automobile

12:57.438 --> 13:00.014
and I'm alarmingly
well-known

13:00.082 --> 13:01.687
at this
particular restaurant,

13:01.755 --> 13:04.465
but I needed you to believe me
when it <i>did</i> matter.

13:04.532 --> 13:08.079
I do believe you,
Chuck, and...

13:08.147 --> 13:09.954
maybe I should've
believed you at Stanford.

13:10.021 --> 13:12.396
But the tests
were in your room

13:12.465 --> 13:14.071
and Bryce said
you were cheating.

13:14.139 --> 13:16.045
What was I supposed
to think at the time?

13:16.113 --> 13:18.689
Yeah, Bryce must've made a very
convincing argument

13:18.757 --> 13:21.902
for you to dump me and then
hop right into his bed.

13:21.970 --> 13:25.182
# #

13:29.065 --> 13:31.005
Maybe this
wasn't such a good idea.

13:31.073 --> 13:33.449
SARAH:
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Bartowski,

13:33.517 --> 13:35.859
but there's a phone call
for you at the bar.

13:38.805 --> 13:40.645
Excuse me.

13:45.365 --> 13:46.569
(muttering)

13:47.774 --> 13:49.078
What do you think
you're doing?

13:49.147 --> 13:50.183
Getting closure.

13:50.251 --> 13:52.761
She owes me
an explanation.

13:52.828 --> 13:54.166
No, she doesn't.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.974
She exercised her First
Amendment right to dump you.

13:56.042 --> 13:57.949
Now get back in there and find
out what Guy is planning.

13:58.016 --> 13:59.487
Look, Chuck,
I know it's hard,

13:59.555 --> 14:01.596
but tonight, you have
to be a spy first.

14:01.664 --> 14:03.571
Yeah, it is hard.
I'm not like you, Sarah.

14:03.639 --> 14:06.215
I can't turn my emotions
on and off like some robot.

14:07.655 --> 14:10.164
I'm sorry,
that was uncalled for.

14:10.232 --> 14:12.574
I'm not acting
like myself tonight.

14:12.642 --> 14:14.247
Are you done feeling sorry
for yourself?

14:14.316 --> 14:16.323
Personally, I'd like
another ten to 15 minutes

14:16.391 --> 14:18.531
of really pathetic
self-indulgence,

14:18.600 --> 14:19.736
but duty calls.

14:19.804 --> 14:21.376
I'm going back in.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.418
Thanks.

14:27.436 --> 14:29.342
Sorry about that.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.183
No more interruptions.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.760
I promise,
and, uh, by the way,

14:33.828 --> 14:35.835
that guy who was just sitting
here a couple minutes ago.

14:35.903 --> 14:37.475
You remember him? Looked just
like Chuck Bartowski?

14:37.543 --> 14:40.018
He was a little whiny
and bitter?

14:40.086 --> 14:41.893
Turns out,
he's an imposter.

14:41.961 --> 14:44.136
Really?
- Yeah, really, but don't worry about it,

14:44.203 --> 14:47.114
'cause I just kung fu'd
him at the bar,

14:47.182 --> 14:49.156
and he won't be bothering you
for the rest of the evening.

14:49.223 --> 14:51.097
Oh, I'm glad,

14:51.165 --> 14:53.641
'cause I like this
Chuck Bartowski a lot more.

14:53.708 --> 14:55.214
Me, too.

15:00.034 --> 15:02.142
So, uh,
you never told me

15:02.210 --> 15:03.748
exactly what
you were working on.

15:03.816 --> 15:06.191
Oh, uh, I can't
really talk about it.

15:07.564 --> 15:10.074
That sounds mysterious, I know.

15:10.141 --> 15:12.383
I'm starting to think there are
some sketchy people involved.

15:12.451 --> 15:14.424
I'm probably just
being paranoid.

15:14.492 --> 15:16.332
I just, I don't know
who to trust.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.240
You can trust me.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.060
Remember biochem?

15:23.128 --> 15:24.399
We're working

15:24.466 --> 15:26.206
on a strain of influenza,
specifically

15:26.273 --> 15:28.448
how the hemagglutinin protein
fuses the viral envelope

15:28.516 --> 15:29.620
with the vacuole's membrane.

15:29.688 --> 15:31.227
Did that sound like

15:31.294 --> 15:32.532
total gibberish?

15:32.600 --> 15:35.142
I understood completely,
"Do you remember biochem?"

15:35.210 --> 15:37.251
And then everything
after that was a little fuzzy.

15:37.318 --> 15:38.957
Okay, I'll simplify.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.296
LESTER:
Yo, Charles!

15:40.365 --> 15:41.368
Hey, buddy.

15:41.435 --> 15:42.740
(whistles)
Who's the babe?

15:42.807 --> 15:44.112
(Jeff laughs)

15:44.179 --> 15:45.919
First Sarah,
now this Chiquita banana?

15:45.987 --> 15:47.546
When are you going to start
sharing the wealth, buddy?

15:47.547 --> 15:48.028
Nice to meet you.

15:48.095 --> 15:49.466
Who's, uh, Sarah?

15:51.309 --> 15:53.014
And, um, are these
friends of yours?

15:53.082 --> 15:55.558
No. No, they're just
old, old Buy More

15:55.626 --> 15:56.930
colleagues that
haven't moved on.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.871
Move on. Move on.

15:58.939 --> 15:59.942
Your car, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

16:02.052 --> 16:04.159
Whoa! Whose Ferrari?

16:04.227 --> 16:05.866
This isn't your car?

16:05.935 --> 16:07.942
Um, the guy makes $12.50
an hour at the Buy More.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.046
You do the math, sister.

16:09.114 --> 16:10.786
You still work
at the Buy More, Chuck?

16:13.398 --> 16:15.238
(tires screech)

16:15.305 --> 16:16.643
Yes, I do.

16:16.712 --> 16:18.786
You do. What about your
computer business?

16:18.853 --> 16:21.731
Technically, the Buy More
offers a wide range

16:21.799 --> 16:24.542
of hardware
and other things...

16:24.610 --> 16:26.818
Wow, too bad Stanford
doesn't offer a BA in BS,

16:26.886 --> 16:28.224
'cause you could've
graduated early.

16:28.292 --> 16:29.629
Jill, please don't!
Look, I'm not--

16:29.697 --> 16:31.269
it's not all a lie!

16:31.337 --> 16:33.077
I can explain to you...

16:39.437 --> 16:42.314
Charles, we did not mean
to bust your whole little...

16:42.382 --> 16:43.418
Just go home!

16:43.486 --> 16:45.260
(tires squeal)

16:48.909 --> 16:50.650
That's it.
Attaboy, work the body!

16:50.718 --> 16:52.392
Work the body, kid.
Work the body!

16:52.460 --> 16:55.272
(falsetto): Hi, I'm Sarah,
Chuck's hot, blonde girlfriend.

16:55.340 --> 16:56.913
(falsetto): And I'm Chuck's
smoking hot brunette.

16:56.981 --> 16:58.018
Bitch.
- Slut.

16:58.087 --> 16:59.225
There's only one way
to settle this.

16:59.292 --> 17:00.599
Pillow fight!
- Pillow fight!

17:00.666 --> 17:03.077
Okay, so how's everyone
coming with the chest...?

17:03.145 --> 17:04.518
You're a dirty girl.
(indistinct chatter)

17:04.585 --> 17:05.689
Come on, guys.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.230
What's wrong with you?

17:07.299 --> 17:08.671
I drink too much.

17:08.739 --> 17:10.748
My parents had
impossible standards.

17:10.816 --> 17:12.623
Well, let's get serious.

17:12.692 --> 17:14.398
How do you expect to pass
the exam tomorrow?

17:14.468 --> 17:15.873
Exam? Come again?

17:15.941 --> 17:17.113
Emmett didn't tell you about

17:17.180 --> 17:18.486
the written part
of the test?

17:18.553 --> 17:19.893
Man, if I wanted
to take tests,

17:19.961 --> 17:21.366
I would've been
a boat captain.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.845
So what happens
if we don't pass?

17:23.913 --> 17:25.286
We get lousy jobs
and live a small,

17:25.354 --> 17:27.763
under-realized life
in the Valley, oh, scary.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.807
(scattered laughter)

17:29.876 --> 17:31.014
Or you can take

17:31.081 --> 17:32.756
the 30-hour remedial course,

17:32.823 --> 17:35.167
unpaid,
and on your own time.

17:36.474 --> 17:39.086
Oh, that seemed
to get their attention.

17:39.155 --> 17:40.560
Doctor...

17:41.867 --> 17:43.073
(slurps)

17:43.140 --> 17:44.680
Hot, hot...

17:51.682 --> 17:53.256
(clears throat)

17:55.266 --> 17:57.041
Am I supposed to ignore you

17:57.109 --> 17:59.017
or can I ask you a series
of personal questions

17:59.085 --> 18:00.257
that you have to answer?

18:01.765 --> 18:03.037
You were right.

18:03.105 --> 18:05.482
You're always right.

18:05.550 --> 18:08.530
I never should've gone out
with Jill last night.

18:08.598 --> 18:10.942
Chuck, maybe I overreacted.

18:11.011 --> 18:12.684
You know? Maybe there
was a reason

18:12.752 --> 18:13.823
to go to dinner
with Jill.

18:13.891 --> 18:16.301
Yeah, to humiliate myself.

18:16.336 --> 18:16.403
Come on,
the way things ended

18:17.710 --> 18:19.484
with you guys,
you've always had a million

18:19.552 --> 18:22.064
questions and no answers,
and now you finally got some.

18:22.131 --> 18:23.537
So what?

18:23.605 --> 18:25.949
What good did it do me to go
poking around in my past?

18:26.017 --> 18:27.992
Because maybe now,

18:28.060 --> 18:29.064
without all
that wondering

18:29.132 --> 18:30.370
and what-iffing,
you can finally

18:30.438 --> 18:31.978
close that chapter of your life.

18:33.152 --> 18:35.161
Right again.

18:36.836 --> 18:39.314
GUY (over speakers):
New York steak, medium rare.

18:39.382 --> 18:40.419
Room 1104.

18:40.488 --> 18:42.228
Guy just ordered room service.

18:42.297 --> 18:44.205
Hmm...
(bang, door rolls open)

18:44.273 --> 18:46.182
Easy, easy, hey.

18:46.249 --> 18:48.425
I come in peace.
- What the hell are you doing here?

18:48.494 --> 18:50.302
I thought I'd swing by
and, you know,

18:50.369 --> 18:52.478
check up on Jill;
make sure she's doing all right.

18:52.546 --> 18:54.053
She's fine, Chuck.

18:54.121 --> 18:55.828
She came home last night and she
hasn't left her room since.

18:55.897 --> 18:57.771
(touch-tone dialing)
Wait, wait-- shh!

18:57.839 --> 18:59.882
She's making a call.
(line ringing)

18:59.949 --> 19:01.590
Hello?
(static emitting)

19:01.658 --> 19:03.298
Damn, bug's on the fritz.

19:03.367 --> 19:04.639
We need a new one.

19:04.706 --> 19:06.213
I'll go in as housekeeping
and plant another.

19:06.281 --> 19:07.452
She might recognize you

19:07.520 --> 19:08.759
as the waitress
from the restaurant.

19:08.826 --> 19:10.065
I'll just tranq her.

19:10.133 --> 19:11.941
She'll wake up in an hour,
thinking nothing of it.

19:12.008 --> 19:13.448
CHUCK: Whoa, whoa,
whoa-- hey, hey.

19:13.516 --> 19:14.520
I'll go. I'll go.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.228
I'll apologize for last night,

19:16.296 --> 19:17.836
she'll tell me what a giant
loser I am,

19:17.904 --> 19:19.645
and I'll plant the new bug;
no tranqing necessary.

19:21.957 --> 19:22.995
You know where
it goes, Chuck?

19:23.062 --> 19:24.201
One button
on the bottom,

19:24.268 --> 19:26.679
click on, click off.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.454
All right.

19:29.996 --> 19:31.369
I'm going in.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.044
I'm going in.

19:33.111 --> 19:34.953
Allow me between
six and eight minutes

19:35.021 --> 19:37.064
to get in,
grab the test and get out.

19:37.131 --> 19:38.303
Are you guys ready?

19:38.371 --> 19:39.508
I was born ready.

19:39.577 --> 19:41.217
I was born premature.

19:41.285 --> 19:43.126
Showtime.

19:46.912 --> 19:48.787
(knock at door)

19:52.305 --> 19:53.779
Hey.

19:53.846 --> 19:55.118
Chuck's not here, sorry.

19:55.186 --> 19:56.190
No-no-no-no-no
we know.

19:56.259 --> 19:57.296
We know, we know,
Elizabeth.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.071
That's why we're here,
to talk to you

19:59.139 --> 20:01.047
<i>about</i> Chuck.

20:07.379 --> 20:08.718
Awesome's bag.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.327
(thuds)

20:17.395 --> 20:18.935
Has Charles been
acting a little, um...

20:19.003 --> 20:21.414
strange lately?

20:21.482 --> 20:23.926
No. No more than usual, why?

20:23.994 --> 20:27.007
We think Chuck
might have rabies.

20:27.076 --> 20:28.415
All the signs
are there:

20:28.482 --> 20:29.821
bouts of confusion,

20:29.890 --> 20:31.999
general edginess,
and at lunch,

20:32.067 --> 20:33.941
Jeff here thought
he saw some foam

20:34.010 --> 20:35.818
around his mouth.

20:35.886 --> 20:39.368
Okay, I appreciate the concern.

20:39.436 --> 20:40.607
Good-bye.

20:43.187 --> 20:44.862
Oh, no.

20:50.088 --> 20:51.059
Looking for something?

20:52.768 --> 20:55.313
You didn't think I'd leave this
in my bag, did you?

20:55.381 --> 20:56.954
Honey, you won't
believe what I just...

20:58.999 --> 21:01.275
Morgan, are you
holding my underwear?

21:01.343 --> 21:03.084
Wait a second, wait a second.

21:03.152 --> 21:05.228
Wait, I-I need to be
very clear about this.

21:05.295 --> 21:06.735
Okay, the only
thing I came

21:06.803 --> 21:08.879
in here to steal was
a CPR test.

21:08.947 --> 21:11.358
So any suggestions
to anything pervy-related

21:11.426 --> 21:12.564
(voice breaks):
to your panties...

21:12.632 --> 21:15.344
(clears throat) panties--
underpants

21:15.412 --> 21:18.325
is, frankly, outrageous.

21:18.393 --> 21:19.933
So you deny being a perv,

21:20.001 --> 21:21.776
but you admit
to being a thief?

21:21.844 --> 21:22.914
Do I at least get points
for honesty?

21:26.801 --> 21:28.675
(sighs)

21:29.883 --> 21:31.322
Who is it?

21:31.390 --> 21:35.073
It's the lying,
yet well-meaning fool

21:35.142 --> 21:36.849
who rented a Ferrari
last night.

21:36.918 --> 21:39.060
Ten bucks says she doesn't
open the door for him.

21:39.128 --> 21:40.199
Make it $20 and you're on.

21:42.612 --> 21:44.285
I don't want to talk
to you, Chuck.

21:44.353 --> 21:45.290
Okay, well, then,

21:45.358 --> 21:47.635
I'll do all the talking.

21:47.704 --> 21:50.047
I know this may come
as a shock to you,

21:50.115 --> 21:54.066
but I'm here to do something
totally crazy

21:54.135 --> 21:56.344
and tell you the truth.

21:57.585 --> 21:59.929
I still work
at the Buy More

21:59.996 --> 22:02.039
and, uh, I still live
with my sister,

22:02.107 --> 22:04.819
and I still have no idea
what I'm doing with my life.

22:04.887 --> 22:06.862
I guess I just wanted you
to think

22:06.930 --> 22:09.576
I was someone special, so...

22:09.644 --> 22:13.595
in order to accomplish that,
I went out and got a new suit

22:13.664 --> 22:15.404
and rented a car
that I clearly

22:15.473 --> 22:17.482
have no idea
how to drive,

22:17.549 --> 22:20.764
because from the second
I saw you again,

22:20.832 --> 22:24.147
I knew that I hadn't
gotten over you yet, Jill.

22:30.078 --> 22:31.383
Really?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.593
You haven't gotten over me?

22:35.068 --> 22:36.340
No.

22:38.217 --> 22:40.192
(lock rattling)

22:40.260 --> 22:42.136
Get in here.

22:42.203 --> 22:44.312
(chuckling)

22:47.027 --> 22:47.997
Sorry about the mess.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.270
Still working on the lecture.

22:49.338 --> 22:50.175
Yeah, you
were starting

22:50.242 --> 22:51.782
to say last night...

22:51.850 --> 22:54.160
infectious disease or something.

22:54.229 --> 22:56.941
I don't know, it sounded
like you were speaking Aramaic.

22:57.008 --> 22:58.649
(laughing):
Not Aramaic.

22:58.717 --> 23:01.061
Simple biochem 101.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.200
Oh, right.

23:02.268 --> 23:04.612
You slept through that class
in college.

23:04.679 --> 23:06.420
Lot of good that would do me
in my current line of work.

23:07.929 --> 23:09.101
Stop it!

23:09.169 --> 23:10.541
Stop what?

23:10.608 --> 23:12.684
Stop underselling
yourself, Chuck.

23:12.753 --> 23:15.063
There was a part
of last night,

23:15.131 --> 23:17.508
somewhere after getting
minor whiplash in your car

23:17.577 --> 23:18.747
and before abandoning you

23:18.815 --> 23:20.757
on the side of the road,
where I had a really,

23:20.825 --> 23:23.403
really nice time.

23:25.481 --> 23:26.418
Really?

23:26.486 --> 23:29.835
Yes... so no more lies.

23:29.904 --> 23:32.381
No more
deception, okay?

23:34.894 --> 23:36.434
(beep)

23:37.808 --> 23:40.855
No more lies, no more deception.

23:40.923 --> 23:42.899
Good.

23:42.967 --> 23:45.411
Do you know how much
I missed doing this?

23:45.479 --> 23:47.890
Missed doing what?

24:02.630 --> 24:03.935
(snaps fingers)

24:04.003 --> 24:04.907
(door opening)

24:06.750 --> 24:07.754
What happened?

24:07.822 --> 24:09.998
Huh? Oh.

24:10.066 --> 24:12.611
Yeah, no, it was...
it was great, fine.

24:12.679 --> 24:14.487
We really connected.

24:14.554 --> 24:15.826
She's talking
about the bug, moron.

24:15.895 --> 24:17.032
CHUCK:
Oh, that.

24:17.100 --> 24:18.372
Yes, of course, that,
I planted it.

24:18.441 --> 24:19.813
It is planted.

24:19.881 --> 24:22.961
I may have turned it off,
though-- I'm not...

24:23.029 --> 24:24.301
Why would you do that?

24:24.370 --> 24:26.278
Relax, these things are
pretty much idiot-proof.

24:26.345 --> 24:28.354
If it's in the room, it
picks up the signal.

24:29.662 --> 24:30.967
(beeping)

24:31.036 --> 24:32.676
It worked,
we're tapped in

24:32.743 --> 24:33.882
to her cell and
the room phone.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.891
Why are you smiling like that?

24:35.960 --> 24:37.332
She kissed me.

24:39.409 --> 24:42.423
No spy stuff, no lies, just me.

24:54.149 --> 24:56.559
Oh! Uh, that dude is some kind

24:56.627 --> 24:58.536
of an assassin--
his code name

24:58.604 --> 24:59.674
is Wolf Den.

24:59.742 --> 25:01.416
CASEY:
11-- that's Guy's floor.

25:01.484 --> 25:03.359
Chuck...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

25:03.427 --> 25:05.167
Stay in the van.
- Don't touch anything.

25:05.236 --> 25:06.172
Ow!

25:07.346 --> 25:08.986
(knock at door)

25:12.002 --> 25:13.106
Room service, sir.

25:13.175 --> 25:14.682
Just put it over here.

25:22.252 --> 25:23.692
(beeping)

25:26.138 --> 25:28.012
(line ringing)

25:28.081 --> 25:28.984
SHARI:
Hello?

25:29.053 --> 25:30.124
Hey, it's Jill.

25:30.191 --> 25:31.363
How are you
after last night?

25:31.431 --> 25:32.971
I'm doing great, Shari.

25:33.038 --> 25:34.780
You're not gonna
believe who came

25:34.847 --> 25:37.492
to my room to apologize tonight.

25:37.561 --> 25:39.703
Please tell me you didn't
let that loser in.

25:39.771 --> 25:41.077
Well, he looked
like a puppy dog.

25:41.145 --> 25:42.383
I couldn't say no.

25:42.452 --> 25:44.393
And... I still think
he's kind of cute.

25:44.462 --> 25:45.967
Cute?
He's a computer dork

25:46.036 --> 25:47.207
that makes
ten bucks an hour.

25:47.274 --> 25:48.212
Hello...

25:48.279 --> 25:49.317
it's $12.50.

25:49.385 --> 25:50.590
Chuck?

25:50.658 --> 25:51.896
Chuck, are you
on my phone?

25:53.137 --> 25:55.347
Uh, Jill, is that you?

25:55.414 --> 25:56.653
Why are you on my phone?

25:56.721 --> 25:58.059
I don't know, I don't know.

25:58.128 --> 25:59.400
It's so... it's...

25:59.468 --> 26:01.309
I tried calling you, so I...

26:01.377 --> 26:04.056
I think our... our wires
got crossed or something.

26:04.124 --> 26:06.133
Is this a party line?

26:06.201 --> 26:08.477
What did you do to my phone?
Did you bug it or something?

26:08.545 --> 26:11.325
Bug it? What... what am I,
an entomologist?

26:11.392 --> 26:12.598
(laughing):
No, you're...

26:12.665 --> 26:13.837
you're talking crazy jargon.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.613
I'm calling security.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.891
Oh, oh, oh.

26:27.405 --> 26:28.575
(grunting)

26:33.500 --> 26:34.807
(grunting)

26:39.798 --> 26:41.639
It's bolted on the inside.

26:41.707 --> 26:42.645
Go.

26:46.330 --> 26:48.540
(screaming)

26:50.250 --> 26:51.722
(thudding)

26:57.150 --> 26:58.254
Clear.

26:58.322 --> 26:59.527
Chuck, Guy is not in his room.

27:01.672 --> 27:03.245
I know.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.543
(crying)

27:06.627 --> 27:07.753
Let it all out.

27:07.836 --> 27:09.505
Thank you.

27:09.546 --> 27:10.506
(blowing nose)

27:10.547 --> 27:12.382
I feel terrible.

27:12.424 --> 27:13.634
Maybe I should
go in there

27:13.717 --> 27:14.718
and console her.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.720
She can't know
you're a spy, Chuck.

27:16.762 --> 27:18.722
Of course, she'll just
think I'm a stalker.

27:18.764 --> 27:20.057
She doesn't think
you're a stalker.

27:20.098 --> 27:23.101
(crying continues)

27:25.812 --> 27:26.772
So...

27:26.855 --> 27:28.357
(squeaking)

27:28.398 --> 27:30.776
Why do you think Guy was killed?

27:30.859 --> 27:33.237
What is this place?

27:33.278 --> 27:35.239
Why was I blindfolded?

27:35.280 --> 27:36.824
It's a secret
CIA compound.

27:36.907 --> 27:38.742
We've been watching you
for days, Ms. Roberts.

27:38.826 --> 27:40.619
Watching me? Why?

27:40.702 --> 27:41.787
We thought
your boss, Guy,

27:41.870 --> 27:43.956
was into some shady business.

27:44.039 --> 27:46.375
We kept an eye on you, as well.

27:46.416 --> 27:47.835
To protect you.

27:52.422 --> 27:55.259
That's my ex-boyfriend, Chuck.

27:55.342 --> 27:57.427
Is he involved in this?

27:57.469 --> 27:59.763
He's been acting
really weird lately.

27:59.805 --> 28:01.431
One minute,
he's completely normal.

28:01.515 --> 28:02.933
The next, he's acting
like total lunatic.

28:02.975 --> 28:04.059
She didn't
say stalker.

28:04.101 --> 28:05.227
Almost like a stalker.

28:07.521 --> 28:10.065
Yeah, it can be a pattern
with these losers.

28:10.107 --> 28:13.110
A pretty girl smiles at them,
they get all infatuated.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.612
Seen it a
million times.

28:15.696 --> 28:17.614
No.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.575
He wasn't involved.

28:19.616 --> 28:21.827
Your boss, Guy, however...

28:21.910 --> 28:24.121
Maybe Guy was involved,
but not how you think.

28:25.455 --> 28:28.000
Guy had discovered
an antiviral serum

28:28.083 --> 28:29.626
for a strain of influenza

28:29.668 --> 28:31.128
used in a bioweapon,

28:31.170 --> 28:33.130
an airborne influenza so deadly

28:33.172 --> 28:35.507
it could kill a person
within one hour if exposed.

28:35.591 --> 28:37.134
Now, a couple
of days ago,

28:37.217 --> 28:38.677
Guy learned that
our company

28:38.760 --> 28:41.388
secretly sells
the influenza bioweapon.

28:41.471 --> 28:42.848
That's why Guy
planned to present

28:42.931 --> 28:44.641
our research at the convention,

28:44.725 --> 28:47.769
so that the company couldn't
cover it up any more.

28:47.811 --> 28:49.688
I guess it's up to me
to do that now.

28:49.771 --> 28:50.606
No, no, no, no,

28:50.647 --> 28:51.440
no, no, no, no.

28:51.481 --> 28:52.691
(banging)

28:52.774 --> 28:54.067
So, you'll do the
presentation...

28:54.151 --> 28:56.195
No, it's too
dangerous, Casey!

28:56.278 --> 28:59.948
Um, your window's knocking.

28:59.990 --> 29:01.158
Excuse me.

29:05.662 --> 29:05.829
What?

29:05.829 --> 29:07.372
Jill is not going
to the conference.

29:07.414 --> 29:08.373
The assassin
will kl her.

29:08.373 --> 29:09.374
It's our only chance,

29:09.500 --> 29:10.918
the only way
to smoke him out.

29:10.959 --> 29:12.377
It is too dangerous
for her, all right?

29:12.503 --> 29:13.295
I am putting my foot down.

29:14.171 --> 29:15.672
Gingerly.

29:15.714 --> 29:17.883
Look, Bartowski,
my job is to look after

29:17.966 --> 29:19.259
all the citizens
of this nation,

29:19.343 --> 29:21.220
not just the girl
that raises your flag.

29:21.303 --> 29:22.387
Sarah...

29:22.471 --> 29:24.014
please, we can't
use Jill as bait

29:24.056 --> 29:26.308
and risk her life
giving that presentation.

29:26.391 --> 29:28.769
Fine, I'll give
the presentation.

29:32.481 --> 29:33.982
(sighs)

29:34.066 --> 29:35.734
Where's Chuck?

29:35.776 --> 29:37.361
Jeff, he will be here, okay?

29:37.402 --> 29:39.404
And as long
as we play this cool,

29:39.446 --> 29:40.531
we can cheat
off of Chuck,

29:40.572 --> 29:41.573
and he'll never know,
all right.

29:41.657 --> 29:43.408
He knows the CPR stuff
inside and out.

29:43.492 --> 29:45.160
Yeah, but Morgan,
if he doesn't show,

29:45.244 --> 29:46.787
we are in...
- If who doesn't show?

29:46.870 --> 29:50.290
Oh, let me guess: the
perennially tardy Chuck.

29:50.374 --> 29:51.917
Hi, hi,
sorry I'm late.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.585
Oh, you're right
on time, bro.

29:59.091 --> 30:00.676
Hey.

30:03.428 --> 30:05.222
Yeah, no problem.

30:08.392 --> 30:10.310
That was interesting.

30:10.394 --> 30:12.312
You have one hour
to take the test.

30:12.396 --> 30:13.272
You may begin...

30:15.315 --> 30:17.109
...now.
(timer ticking)

30:33.667 --> 30:35.002
Oh, no, that's
not right.

30:35.085 --> 30:37.254
No, of course not.

30:39.381 --> 30:41.216
(murmuring)

30:46.638 --> 30:48.515
Anything?

30:50.934 --> 30:52.394
It's all good so far.

30:56.190 --> 30:57.399
Please take your seats.

30:57.482 --> 30:59.193
Giving the presentation

30:59.276 --> 31:02.321
for Dr. Lafleur
will be... his associate

31:02.404 --> 31:05.991
coming from Sydney, Australia.
Dr. Eva Anderson.

31:06.033 --> 31:07.993
(clapping)

31:08.035 --> 31:09.203
Thank you.

31:11.955 --> 31:13.540
Yes, g'day,
I'm Dr. Eva Anderson,

31:13.624 --> 31:15.501
and I'm here to talk
to you all today

31:15.542 --> 31:17.503
about a deadly poison
that could change

31:17.586 --> 31:19.254
the course of human science.

31:19.338 --> 31:20.756
I'm honored to stand

31:20.839 --> 31:23.634
before you all today
on behalf of Dr. Lafleur.

31:23.675 --> 31:27.054
Throughout the many years
of our research...

31:27.137 --> 31:29.973
Um, excuse me,
I've got to go to the loo.

31:36.939 --> 31:38.982
CASEY:
Seal the room, seal the room!

31:39.024 --> 31:42.611
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an NSA emergency.

31:42.694 --> 31:46.073
No one-- I repeat, no one--
gets in or out.

31:57.167 --> 31:59.044
(cell phone ringing)
Sorry, sorry.

32:00.629 --> 32:02.714
Oh, um, I'm sorry,
I have to take this.

32:02.756 --> 32:04.049
This could be
an important call.

32:04.132 --> 32:07.135
Oh, I'm sorry,
and this isn't important?

32:07.219 --> 32:09.346
There is no leaving the room
during the test.

32:09.388 --> 32:11.306
Casey, hey,
everything okay?

32:11.390 --> 32:12.891
Our Wolf Den friend
released the poison.

32:12.933 --> 32:14.184
Sarah got out.

32:14.226 --> 32:15.561
I'm still in here
with the scientists.

32:15.602 --> 32:16.812
Hazmat crews are on their way.

32:16.895 --> 32:18.188
We have an hour, maybe less.

32:18.230 --> 32:19.481
You gotta get to Jill.

32:19.565 --> 32:20.816
See if she has an antidote.
(man coughing)

32:20.899 --> 32:22.067
Um, I... I really don't

32:22.150 --> 32:23.694
think she wants
to see me right now.

32:23.735 --> 32:26.071
Chuck, we're dying here.

32:26.155 --> 32:29.158
I don't care what you have
to say or do, just get it done.

32:31.743 --> 32:33.412
Gotta go, good luck.

32:33.453 --> 32:35.372
(all expressing protest)

32:36.999 --> 32:38.584
I guess someone
doesn't think

32:38.625 --> 32:39.585
saving lives
is important.

32:45.799 --> 32:48.260
(pounding on door)

32:48.343 --> 32:50.095
Jill, it's Chuck,
you have to open the door!

32:50.179 --> 32:51.471
JILL:
Go away, Chuck!

32:51.555 --> 32:52.514
This isn't funny
anymore.

32:52.598 --> 32:54.016
Look, it's an emergency, okay?

32:54.099 --> 32:55.726
I know that my credibility
with you is at an all-time low

32:55.767 --> 32:57.436
but you need to listen to me.

32:57.477 --> 32:59.438
The bioweapon has been released
at the conference center.

32:59.521 --> 33:01.648
How do you know
about the virus?

33:01.732 --> 33:03.108
Because, Jill...

33:04.109 --> 33:06.361
...I'm a CIA agent.

33:06.445 --> 33:09.323
Oh, my God, Chuck, you really
need to get some help.

33:09.406 --> 33:11.950
I am the help.

33:11.992 --> 33:13.452
Don't believe anything else
that I've told you,

33:13.535 --> 33:15.496
but believe this. We have to get
them the antidote right now.

33:15.579 --> 33:16.663
I'm going to call the police,
Chuck.

33:16.747 --> 33:18.373
I've already taken the liberty.

33:18.457 --> 33:19.750
Have a look for yourself.

33:23.962 --> 33:25.297
Oh, my God.

33:28.133 --> 33:30.260
You are telling the truth.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.138
Hold on.

33:33.180 --> 33:35.641
She's pretty cute, right?

33:36.767 --> 33:37.726
We used to date.

33:37.809 --> 33:39.436
Okay.
Okay.

33:39.478 --> 33:40.646
Look, just stay close,
don't be scared.

33:40.729 --> 33:42.231
(clears throat)

33:42.314 --> 33:44.233
All right, people, wheels up.

33:44.316 --> 33:46.151
Let's move!

33:52.616 --> 33:53.867
(siren wailing)

33:55.953 --> 33:57.371
Hey!

33:57.454 --> 33:58.705
Who's in charge here?

33:58.789 --> 33:59.581
I am.

33:59.665 --> 34:01.708
Not anymore.

34:01.750 --> 34:03.585
Thank you.

34:05.212 --> 34:06.171
Casey, it's Chuck.

34:06.213 --> 34:07.673
I'm with Jill.
What's your status?

34:07.714 --> 34:10.592
By my time,
we got about 15 minutes.

34:10.676 --> 34:12.094
I have to go in there.

34:12.177 --> 34:15.054
Okay, I need a Level A
Hazmat suit right now.

34:15.097 --> 34:16.181
We don't have
those suits yet.

34:16.223 --> 34:17.975
CDC will be here
in ten minutes.

34:18.058 --> 34:18.976
We don't have ten minutes.

34:19.059 --> 34:20.060
I'll go in without one.

34:21.895 --> 34:22.938
No. You? No.

34:23.021 --> 34:24.147
It's too dangerous.
I'll do it.

34:24.231 --> 34:25.815
Chuck, whoever goes in there

34:25.899 --> 34:27.860
has to be able to make
the antidote. That's me.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.319
Well, is it something
you could talk me through?

34:29.402 --> 34:30.696
I guess.

34:30.737 --> 34:32.197
Okay, well,
then I'm going in.

34:32.239 --> 34:33.574
No, Chuck, wait!

34:34.908 --> 34:35.909
Are you sure?

34:35.993 --> 34:37.578
Yeah.

34:37.661 --> 34:39.246
I'm sure.

34:39.329 --> 34:40.831
Okay.

34:40.914 --> 34:42.081
Okay, uh....

34:42.123 --> 34:43.708
I'm going to have to
inject you first.

34:45.752 --> 34:46.545
Uh...

34:48.088 --> 34:48.755
Oh, that's a big needle.

34:48.839 --> 34:50.549
Ready?
- Yeah.

34:50.591 --> 34:52.009
Yeah...
(moaning)

34:52.092 --> 34:53.302
Okay, that has
a modified

34:53.385 --> 34:54.511
version of the viral strain.

34:54.594 --> 34:55.929
Now your body metabolizes
the poison

34:55.971 --> 34:57.222
and the antiviral
serum is going

34:57.306 --> 34:58.390
to be created from
your blood.

34:58.473 --> 34:59.558
Poison? Poison?!

34:59.641 --> 35:00.726
I thought I was getting
the antidote?

35:00.809 --> 35:01.810
You just gave me poison?!

35:01.852 --> 35:03.061
Yeah.

35:03.145 --> 35:04.855
It's the only way to
make the antidote.

35:04.938 --> 35:06.648
Did you not
understand that?

35:06.690 --> 35:07.858
Oh, that.

35:07.941 --> 35:09.193
Of-- No, I understand
that whole part.

35:09.276 --> 35:10.652
We're living on the edge.

35:10.694 --> 35:12.571
Love the rush.

35:41.934 --> 35:45.145
Oh, damn.

35:47.314 --> 35:49.358
CIA?

35:50.943 --> 35:52.236
(buzzer)

35:55.280 --> 35:56.573
(coughing)

36:00.494 --> 36:01.912
Oh, no, no, no, no,
what are you doing in here?

36:01.995 --> 36:03.413
It's a long story,
but the headline is

36:03.497 --> 36:04.498
I'm our only hope for survival.

36:04.540 --> 36:06.458
And here I thought

36:06.542 --> 36:08.377
things couldn't get any worse.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.838
JILL: Okay, inside the briefcase,
is a medisyringe,

36:10.879 --> 36:12.506
multi-dose injector.

36:12.548 --> 36:14.633
I need you to extract 60 cc's
of your own blood,

36:14.716 --> 36:16.593
put it through the centrifuge,
and then inject

36:16.677 --> 36:19.888
one cc of the antiviral serum
into each of those infected.

36:19.930 --> 36:21.306
Okay, okay.

36:21.390 --> 36:22.975
Casey, here-- No, no,
no, no, no, no.

36:23.058 --> 36:24.560
Casey, you have, you
have to take the gun.

36:24.601 --> 36:25.769
Huh?
- Take the gun. And you have to--

36:25.853 --> 36:27.354
You have to take
my blood, okay?

36:27.396 --> 36:28.897
So just take my blood.

36:28.939 --> 36:30.732
Okay.

36:33.026 --> 36:35.112
Okay.

36:35.195 --> 36:36.530
Take the gun, Chuck.

36:36.572 --> 36:37.531
Take the gun, Chuck.
- Huh?

36:37.573 --> 36:38.824
What?
- Take the gun.

36:38.907 --> 36:40.492
Take the...

36:40.576 --> 36:42.161
Oh, God.

36:42.244 --> 36:44.079
JILL:
Chuck, what's happening?

36:44.121 --> 36:45.497
I need-- I need help

36:45.581 --> 36:46.623
right now.
Casey's fading fast!

36:46.707 --> 36:47.499
The just gun dropped!

36:47.583 --> 36:48.542
And it shattered!

36:48.625 --> 36:49.960
That was the only syringe!

36:50.043 --> 36:52.087
Okay, uh, stay calm.

36:52.129 --> 36:53.130
I'm-I'm going
to find another.

36:53.172 --> 36:55.382
Jill, please hurry.

36:55.465 --> 36:57.384
We're running out of time.

36:57.467 --> 36:58.969
(clock ticking)

36:59.052 --> 37:00.679
Oh, time's running out,
gentlemen.

37:00.762 --> 37:02.055
You have one minute left.

37:02.139 --> 37:03.932
Oh! And I see
you have yet

37:03.974 --> 37:05.517
to attempt the Heimlich
section.

37:05.601 --> 37:07.186
(chuckles)
Interesting.

37:14.610 --> 37:16.487
(clears throat)

37:45.557 --> 37:47.142
(gagging)

37:47.184 --> 37:48.519
Oh, good Lord!

37:48.602 --> 37:50.145
I think Jeff
is choking!

37:50.187 --> 37:52.356
Someone should do the-the
Heimlich or something!

37:52.397 --> 37:54.316
Jeff, Jeff,
can you speak?

37:54.358 --> 37:55.526
Are you choking?

37:55.567 --> 37:57.027
Okay, on your feet.

37:57.110 --> 37:58.654
On your feet!

37:58.695 --> 38:00.155
All right, on the
count of three

38:00.197 --> 38:01.824
I'm going to do an inward
and upward thrust.

38:01.865 --> 38:03.158
Two inches above your
belly button.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.661
One, two, three!

38:05.702 --> 38:07.871
Repeat four times.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.544
Oh, yes!

38:13.627 --> 38:15.671
BOTH:
Done!

38:17.756 --> 38:19.424
CHUCK:
What are we gonna do, Casey?

38:19.508 --> 38:20.759
Think of something.

38:20.843 --> 38:22.094
You're smart.

38:22.177 --> 38:23.887
You went to Stanford.

38:23.929 --> 38:25.514
Sort of.

38:25.597 --> 38:26.098
(sneezes)

38:26.139 --> 38:27.391
Ugh, God!

38:27.474 --> 38:29.017
Cover your mouth.

38:29.101 --> 38:30.185
That's disgusting!

38:32.813 --> 38:33.647
CHUCK:
That's it!

38:35.440 --> 38:37.860
Hey, hey, this is gonna
sound crazy, but-but

38:37.943 --> 38:38.986
viruses are spread
airborne, right?

38:39.069 --> 38:40.237
Yeah.
- I mean, you catch them

38:40.279 --> 38:41.613
when someone sneezes. Coughs.
- Yeah.

38:41.697 --> 38:44.616
Well, maybe the antivirals
metabolize in saliva.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.577
What are you talking about?

38:49.872 --> 38:52.082
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

38:52.124 --> 38:53.125
What?

38:53.167 --> 38:55.043
No, no!

38:55.127 --> 38:56.503
No, no, no, no.

38:56.587 --> 38:58.297
I served my country with
honor, Bartowski.

38:58.380 --> 38:59.381
Please.

38:59.464 --> 39:01.300
Let me die with
my dignity.

39:04.636 --> 39:05.554
JILL:
Chuck?

39:07.222 --> 39:08.891
Jill!
- What are you doing?

39:08.974 --> 39:10.934
Jill, Jill, hey.

39:10.976 --> 39:13.228
I thought that-- I thought
that maybe the antivirals

39:13.312 --> 39:15.522
could be spread
by saliva.

39:15.606 --> 39:17.733
That's ridiculous.

39:17.816 --> 39:19.985
No wonder
you failed biochem.

39:20.068 --> 39:21.612
(grunting)
From the deepest recesses

39:21.653 --> 39:22.654
of my soul, I'm sorry.

39:27.326 --> 39:28.327
Oh, here we go again.

39:40.214 --> 39:41.632
Okay, you take
half the room,

39:41.673 --> 39:42.758
I'll take the other.
One cc each.

39:42.841 --> 39:43.967
Okay? Hurry.

39:44.009 --> 39:46.053
Okay, okay. Casey, Casey.

39:46.136 --> 39:47.513
(moans)
Ah.

39:47.596 --> 39:49.389
(grunts)

39:49.473 --> 39:52.226
(siren wailing, buzzer blaring)

39:57.564 --> 39:59.566
(all cheering)

40:01.401 --> 40:03.862
MAN:
Way to go, Agent Carmichael!

40:09.952 --> 40:11.411
Chuck!

40:11.453 --> 40:12.871
You're amazing.

40:12.913 --> 40:14.873
Nah.

40:14.915 --> 40:16.750
Well, maybe a little.

40:18.669 --> 40:20.254
# #

40:34.560 --> 40:36.270
CASEY:
<i>Jill Roberts</i>

40:36.353 --> 40:37.563
now knows Chuck's an asset.

40:37.604 --> 40:38.981
What do you want us
to do about it?

40:39.064 --> 40:40.399
BECKMAN:
I want you to do nothing.

40:40.482 --> 40:43.193
The assassin Agent Walker shot
was a member of Fulcrum.

40:43.235 --> 40:44.778
A rogue CIA agent.

40:44.862 --> 40:47.573
We don't know the extent
of their penetration.

40:47.614 --> 40:49.867
If Jill knows something
they may make a play for her.

40:49.908 --> 40:52.494
So, you want to use her as bait?

40:52.578 --> 40:55.497
General, uh, Chuck has real
feelings for Jill.

40:55.581 --> 40:58.083
I don't think he'd approve of us
using her like this.

40:58.167 --> 41:00.294
That's why you're not going
to tell him, Agent Walker.

41:02.462 --> 41:05.465
Wow.

41:05.549 --> 41:06.925
That's something I haven't seen
in a while.

41:06.967 --> 41:08.093
What, this--

41:08.093 --> 41:09.261
I wear this like
four times a week.

41:09.344 --> 41:10.554
No, your smile.

41:10.596 --> 41:12.389
You look happy.

41:12.431 --> 41:13.390
Yeah.

41:13.432 --> 41:14.516
Yeah, that.

41:14.600 --> 41:15.517
That thing.

41:15.601 --> 41:17.269
Um, I don't know.

41:17.311 --> 41:18.770
I guess, uh,

41:18.854 --> 41:20.189
I found some of
those answers

41:20.272 --> 41:21.565
that you said I was
looking for.

41:21.648 --> 41:23.525
Well, thank God.

41:23.609 --> 41:25.652
I am so relieved.

41:25.736 --> 41:28.155
I just think that,
you know, Sarah--

41:28.238 --> 41:30.115
There's really something
special about her.

41:30.199 --> 41:32.451
I think that you had
to go through all that stuff

41:32.493 --> 41:34.995
with Jill so you could figure
out who the one is for you.

41:35.037 --> 41:36.246
And now that
you found her

41:36.330 --> 41:37.623
you'll stop
wondering

41:37.664 --> 41:38.999
about somebody else.

41:39.082 --> 41:40.834
(phone rings)

41:44.338 --> 41:45.297
Take it.

41:45.339 --> 41:46.298
Tell Sarah I said hi.

41:46.340 --> 41:47.466
(ringing continues)

41:48.634 --> 41:50.177
Hey.

41:50.260 --> 41:52.095
How's my favorite secret agent?

41:52.179 --> 41:54.097
Um... good.

41:54.181 --> 41:55.432
Yeah, good.

41:55.516 --> 41:57.184
I just-- I have to study

41:57.226 --> 41:59.645
for a CPR test for my day job
at the Buy More.

41:59.686 --> 42:02.231
I could use some help
with the mouth-to-mouth.

42:02.314 --> 42:03.815
Well, what about your cover
girlfriend?

42:03.857 --> 42:05.025
Won't she be jealous?

42:05.108 --> 42:06.485
No.

42:06.527 --> 42:08.612
No, our-our relationship's
a cover, you know.

42:08.695 --> 42:10.364
There's nothing
to be jealous about.

42:10.405 --> 42:11.740
So everything...

42:11.824 --> 42:13.826
it's all fake.

42:13.867 --> 42:16.245
That sounds really lonely,
Chuck.

42:16.328 --> 42:18.372
Yeah, it is.

42:18.455 --> 42:20.374
But...

42:20.415 --> 42:23.585
but now that you're here maybe
we can have something real.

42:23.669 --> 42:25.546
Us. Together.

42:25.587 --> 42:27.381
JILL:
I like the sound of that.

42:27.422 --> 42:29.007
So about that
mouth-to-mouth...

42:29.216 --> 42:30.467
(chuckles)
