<b> <i>Announcer: Teamwork was</i> </b>
<b> <i>immediately put to test</i> </b>

00:26.627 --> 00:29.796
<b> <i>with a series of intense</i> </b>

00:29.863 --> 00:31.965

00:32.031 --> 00:33.800
<b> <i>Two heads</i> </b>
<b> <i>should work better than one.</i> </b>

<b> <i>announcer: Teams had one last</i> </b>
<b> <i>chance for survival.</i> </b>

00:45.579 --> 00:47.247
<b>- Crunch time, buddy.</b>

00:47.314 --> 00:49.049
<b>- Me and Dave have never</b>
<b>tag-teamed on a tattoo.</b>

00:49.116 --> 00:51.351
<b>- I don't want you to go past</b>
<b>what you're drawing.</b>

01:03.230 --> 01:05.065
<b>- The Marked Society.</b>

01:05.098 --> 01:07.868
<b>- This is the farthest from a</b>
<b>realistic alligator ever.</b>

01:07.935 --> 01:09.069
<b>- Tri-Cities Tattoo.</b>

01:09.102 --> 01:10.704

<b>This is a silhouette with some</b>

01:12.072 --> 01:13.640
<b>- Thicker Than Blood.</b>

01:13.707 --> 01:15.542
<b>- It's completely anatomically</b>
<b>impossible.</b>

01:15.609 --> 01:17.711
<b>You're not showing</b>
<b>us that you can draw from life.</b>

01:17.778 --> 01:20.647

<b>the strongest competitors.</b>
<b>- I feel like that, yeah.</b>

02:24.111 --> 02:26.146

<b>for a while.</b>

02:26.213 --> 02:29.082
<b>- Yeah, maybe if we helped each</b>
<b>other make it to the finale.</b>

02:29.116 --> 02:30.551
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- And then it's, like,</b>

02:30.617 --> 02:31.919

02:31.985 --> 02:33.554
<b>There's</b>
<b>three in the finale.</b>

02:33.620 --> 02:35.155
<b>- And then it becomes a real</b>
<b>competition.</b>

02:35.222 --> 02:36.723
<b>- Exactly, so we take care of</b>
<b>ourselves,</b>

02:36.790 --> 02:38.559
<b>let the weak weed</b>
<b>themselves out,</b>

02:38.625 --> 02:41.929

03:01.048 --> 03:02.249

03:02.316 --> 03:06.186
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

03:08.055 --> 03:09.957
<b>You're here to prove that your</b>
<b>shop is the best.</b>

03:10.057 --> 03:12.326
<b>Make it to the end,</b>

<b>prize in "Ink Master" history,</b>

03:14.494 --> 03:19.066
<b>$200,000, a feature in "Inked"</b>

03:21.602 --> 03:23.303
<b>- Yeah.</b>

03:23.370 --> 03:26.273
<b>- And your shop will also earn</b>
<b>the first-ever title</b>

03:26.340 --> 03:27.741
<b>of Master Shop.</b>

03:27.808 --> 03:29.810
<b>- [bleep] yeah.</b>

03:29.877 --> 03:31.345
<b>- You survived the first week,</b>
<b>but your odds of winning aren't</b>

03:31.411 --> 03:34.715
<b>getting any better, at least</b>
<b>not yet.</b>

03:36.216 --> 03:39.186
<b>- Every time a shop is</b>
<b>eliminated,</b>

03:39.253 --> 03:42.089
<b>another shop will</b>
<b>enter the competition ready to</b>

03:42.089 --> 03:44.424
<b>fight for the title of Master</b>
<b>Shop.</b>

03:44.491 --> 03:46.360
<b>- What?</b>

03:46.426 --> 03:48.095
<b>We just sent someone home, and</b>
<b>now someone else comes in?</b>

03:48.161 --> 03:50.097
<b>- Of course.</b>
<b>It's like the hydra.</b>

03:50.097 --> 03:52.699
<b>Every time you cut a head</b>
<b>off, another one springs up.</b>

03:52.766 --> 03:54.134
<b>- But that's not all.</b>

03:54.201 --> 03:55.969
<b>- Oh, come on.</b>

03:56.103 --> 03:58.138
<b>- The shops entering the</b>
<b>competition will have at least</b>

03:58.205 --> 04:00.474
<b>one returning artist who's</b>
<b>competed</b>

04:00.541 --> 04:03.710
<b>for the title and failed.</b>

04:03.777 --> 04:04.878
<b>- Oh, dude.</b>

04:04.945 --> 04:06.847
<b>- What?</b>

04:06.914 --> 04:09.049
<b>- These people coming back in</b>
<b>have already been here.</b>

04:09.082 --> 04:12.186
<b>They already know the pressure,</b>
<b>and that's really intimidating.</b>

04:12.252 --> 04:15.589
<b>- The first returning veteran is</b>
<b>from Scottsdale, Arizona,</b>

04:15.656 --> 04:18.125
<b>and competed in season four.</b>

04:18.192 --> 04:19.826
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

04:19.892 --> 04:24.565
<b>He's the owner of Old Town Ink,</b>
<b>Bubba Irwin.</b>

04:24.631 --> 04:26.233
<b>- Who's that?</b>

04:26.300 --> 04:27.401
<b>- Yeah, I'd never heard of him.</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

04:27.467 --> 04:29.269
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

04:29.336 --> 04:30.737
<b>- I definitely came</b>
<b>underprepared the first time</b>

04:30.804 --> 04:31.939
<b>I was here.</b>

04:32.072 --> 04:33.707
<b>- You like doing this stuff?</b>

04:33.774 --> 04:35.542
<b>- Yeah, it's cool, man. I've</b>
<b>never done one before.</b>

04:35.609 --> 04:38.545
<b>- There's no solid color.</b>
<b>There's no straight outline.</b>

04:38.612 --> 04:40.214
<b>Bubba, you look pissed.</b>

04:40.280 --> 04:41.682
<b>- I feel like I did a pretty</b>
<b>good job.</b>

04:41.748 --> 04:43.383
<b>I just can't figure</b>
<b>out what they want.</b>

04:43.450 --> 04:45.352
<b>- You have many problems with</b>
<b>your outline.</b>

04:45.419 --> 04:48.088
<b>If you give somebody enough</b>
<b>rope, they hang themselves.</b>

04:48.088 --> 04:51.291
<b>- Bubba, you do not have what it</b>
<b>takes to be Ink Master.</b>

04:51.358 --> 04:53.093
<b>- Getting kicked off of here,</b>
<b>you could feel sorry</b>

04:53.160 --> 04:55.095
<b>for yourself, or you can go home</b>
<b>and do the homework,</b>

04:55.095 --> 04:56.396
<b>and that's</b>
<b>exactly what I did.</b>

04:56.463 --> 04:58.098
<b>- Welcome back, Bubba.</b>

04:58.098 --> 04:59.766
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>- Who'd you bring with you?</b>

04:59.833 --> 05:00.934
<b>- I brought a good buddy of</b>
<b>mine, DJ Tambe.</b>

05:01.034 --> 05:02.269
<b>- Oh, [bleep].</b>

05:02.336 --> 05:03.937
<b>- He's the most versatile.</b>

05:04.037 --> 05:05.706
<b>He's</b>
<b>the best artist I know.</b>

05:05.772 --> 05:07.374
<b>- Bubba's asked me to take him</b>
<b>under his wing,</b>

05:07.441 --> 05:09.243
<b>and I've taught</b>
<b>him a lot of things since.</b>

05:09.309 --> 05:10.878
<b>I'm not the artist that sticks</b>
<b>to one style.</b>

05:10.944 --> 05:12.546
<b>Every day is</b>
<b>something different for me.</b>

05:12.613 --> 05:14.314
<b>Everything we touch, we're</b>
<b>gonna crush.</b>

05:14.381 --> 05:15.782
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Crush.</b>

05:15.849 --> 05:17.618
<b>- Every single thing.</b>
<b>- [bleep].</b>

05:17.684 --> 05:20.654
<b>DJ and I have known</b>
<b>each other for several years.</b>

05:20.721 --> 05:23.190
<b>DJ is an incredible artist, and</b>
<b>he's fast,</b>

05:23.257 --> 05:24.525
<b>and he's efficient.</b>

05:24.591 --> 05:26.860
<b>We're done.</b>
<b>- [inaudible]</b>

05:26.927 --> 05:29.463
<b>- The two of you should be</b>
<b>warned, this week is designed</b>

05:29.530 --> 05:32.766
<b>to put your shop to the</b>
<b>ultimate test.</b>

05:32.833 --> 05:34.868
<b>Each week</b>
<b>everyone will be tested</b>

05:34.935 --> 05:36.670
<b>on the</b>
<b>skill that exposes the veteran</b>

05:36.737 --> 05:40.240
<b>artists' shortcomings from the</b>
<b>last time they competed.</b>

05:40.307 --> 05:42.242
<b>- Damn.</b>

05:42.309 --> 05:44.344
<b>- Yes. There's a silver lining</b>
<b>to the veterans coming back.</b>

05:44.411 --> 05:45.779
<b>We know what you got</b>
<b>eliminated on.</b>

05:45.846 --> 05:48.749
<b>â™ª I know what you</b>
<b>suck at â™ª</b>

05:48.815 --> 05:50.417
<b> <i>- I knew this was gonna happen.</i> </b>

05:50.484 --> 05:51.985
<b>That's all I practiced on, was</b>
<b>my shortcomings.</b>

05:52.085 --> 05:53.687
<b> <i>I'm ready for anything.</i> </b>

05:53.754 --> 05:55.756
<b>- This week we're testing your</b>
<b>fundamentals.</b>

05:55.822 --> 05:57.491
<b> <i>- Fundamentals of tattooing</i> </b>
<b> <i>start with the drawing.</i> </b>

05:57.558 --> 05:58.926
<b>Then it</b>
<b>goes to your stencil.</b>

05:58.992 --> 06:00.827
<b>Then it</b>
<b>goes to your application,</b>

06:00.894 --> 06:02.896
<b> <i>line work, making sure your</i> </b>
<b> <i>shading's smooth.</i> </b>

06:03.030 --> 06:04.631
<b>I didn't have that last</b>
<b>time; I do have it now.</b>

06:04.698 --> 06:07.367
<b> <i>- If you get eliminated for poor</i> </b>
<b> <i>fundamentals,</i> </b>

06:07.434 --> 06:09.369
<b>maybe you should not tattoo</b>
<b>anymore; I don't know.</b>

06:09.436 --> 06:12.239
<b>- A true artist can make</b>
<b>something extraordinary</b>

06:12.306 --> 06:13.841
<b>out of anything.</b>

06:13.907 --> 06:15.843
<b>For this flash challenge you</b>
<b>must create an image</b>

06:15.909 --> 06:18.145
<b>on a 10-foot by 10-foot canvas</b>

06:18.212 --> 06:22.082
<b>using only Post-it notes.</b>

06:26.119 --> 06:30.324
<b>- At each station are nearly</b>
<b>50,000 Post-it notes.</b>

06:30.390 --> 06:32.392
<b>You must</b>
<b>layer them using each</b>

06:32.459 --> 06:35.395
<b>individual colored square as a</b>
<b>basic building block</b>

06:35.462 --> 06:38.198
<b>to bring</b>
<b>one massive image to life.</b>

06:38.265 --> 06:40.133
<b>- Make something original,</b>
<b>something beautiful,</b>

06:40.200 --> 06:41.702
<b>and that</b>
<b>stands out from the crowd.</b>

06:41.768 --> 06:44.171
<b>- Remember, you win as a shop,</b>

06:44.238 --> 06:46.540
<b>and you lose as a shop,</b>

06:46.607 --> 06:48.575
<b>so you</b>
<b>must work with your teammate.</b>

06:49.710 --> 06:51.545
<b>- You have five hours,</b>

06:51.612 --> 06:55.716
<b>and your</b>
<b>time starts now.</b>

06:55.782 --> 06:58.385
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

06:58.452 --> 07:01.054
<b>- Okay, what were you thinking?</b>
<b>- I was...oh, my God.</b>

07:01.121 --> 07:02.890
<b>- Oh, bad, right out the gate.</b>

07:03.023 --> 07:05.025
<b>- What the [bleep] did you do</b>
<b>that for?</b>

07:05.058 --> 07:06.426
<b>Great start, great start.</b>

07:06.493 --> 07:08.395
<b>- Yeah, we don't [bleep] need</b>
<b>those yet.</b>

07:08.462 --> 07:10.764
<b>- Challenging these artists on</b>
<b>Post-it notes is a test</b>

07:10.831 --> 07:13.233
<b> <i>to see who wants to really</i> </b>
<b> <i>achieve something,</i> </b>

07:13.300 --> 07:15.102
<b> <i>who wants to succeed, and who</i> </b>
<b> <i>can stay focused.</i> </b>

07:15.169 --> 07:16.670
<b>- Dude, I don't think five hours</b>
<b>is enough.</b>

07:16.737 --> 07:18.238
<b>- We'll see how creative they</b>
<b>are.</b>

07:18.305 --> 07:21.041
<b>- Laser gun, classic red,</b>
<b>yellow thunderbolt.</b>

07:21.041 --> 07:23.076
<b> <i>- Sometimes veterans change the</i> </b>
<b> <i>competition.</i> </b>

07:23.143 --> 07:24.578
<b>Sometimes the</b>
<b>house puts their teeth out</b>

07:24.645 --> 07:26.079
<b>and</b>
<b>gangs up against them,</b>

07:26.146 --> 07:27.447
<b>and it</b>
<b>becomes a rough room.</b>

07:27.514 --> 07:30.350
<b>- [inaudible] DJ, he's a</b>
<b>problem.</b>

07:30.417 --> 07:31.552
<b>- If I could get these things</b>
<b>open, dude.</b>

07:31.618 --> 07:32.853
<b>- Let daddy have it.</b>

07:32.920 --> 07:34.254
<b>- So what are we thinking, man?</b>

07:34.321 --> 07:35.856
<b>- A [bleep] torch going</b>
<b>sideways?</b>

07:35.923 --> 07:37.524
<b>- We have to utilize this whole</b>
<b>thing.</b>

07:37.591 --> 07:39.193
<b>- I know, but if we--you know</b>
<b>what I'm saying?</b>

07:39.259 --> 07:41.061
<b>- Okay, dude, I'm taking the</b>
<b>lead on this one.</b>

07:41.128 --> 07:44.064
<b>[Bleep] tiger.</b>
<b>[exhales]</b>

07:44.097 --> 07:46.066
<b>- A tiger would be sick.</b>

07:46.133 --> 07:49.203
<b> <i>- If we layer the sticky notes,</i> </b>
<b> <i>we can create fur, texture,</i> </b>

07:49.269 --> 07:51.371
<b>straight lines, symmetry.</b>

07:51.438 --> 07:53.440
<b> <i>All the fundamentals are falling</i> </b>
<b> <i>in place.</i> </b>

07:53.507 --> 07:54.741
<b>- Dude, let's do a gold tooth.</b>

07:54.808 --> 07:56.210
<b>- Maybe.</b>

<b>You'll have the power to assign</b>

15:32.411 --> 15:34.413
<b>in the next</b>
<b>elimination tattoo.</b>

15:34.480 --> 15:36.448
<b>- When I was on season four, I</b>
<b>feel like I brought a BB gun to</b>

15:36.515 --> 15:38.484
<b>World War III, and this time I</b>
<b>feel like a brought an A-bomb</b>

15:38.550 --> 15:40.085
<b> <i>to World War I.</i> </b>

15:40.152 --> 15:41.553

15:41.620 --> 15:42.755

15:42.821 --> 15:44.757
<b>- Head on back to the loft.</b>

15:44.823 --> 15:46.759
<b>- Well, the new veterans, they</b>
<b>have control of the tattoo.</b>

15:46.825 --> 15:48.494
<b> <i>Now</i> </b>
<b> <i>they can just shoot at every</i> </b>

<b>- I know.</b>

16:02.508 --> 16:04.143
<b>- If we win both challenges</b>

16:04.209 --> 16:06.011
<b>these guys are gonna be [bleep]</b>
<b>themselves.</b>

16:06.044 --> 16:07.012
<b>- We got to take out the people</b>
<b>that you know are,</b>

16:07.045 --> 16:08.947
<b>like, hard hitters.</b>

16:08.981 --> 16:10.783
<b>- Yeah, yeah, there's gonna be</b>
<b>tons of [bleep] skulls.</b>

16:10.849 --> 16:12.317
<b>Might as well give them to the</b>

16:12.384 --> 16:14.119
<b>themselves the best, are</b>

16:14.186 --> 16:15.454
<b>- I'm all for it.</b>
<b>- I just want to show everybody</b>

16:15.521 --> 16:16.455

<b>what I mean?</b>

16:16.522 --> 16:18.157
<b>- I know.</b>

16:18.223 --> 16:20.092
<b>- DJ and Bubba come in here, big</b>

16:20.159 --> 16:21.960
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Thinking you run the place.</b>

16:22.027 --> 16:23.162
<b>- Thinking you run the place.</b>
<b>- I'm not intimidated.</b>

16:23.228 --> 16:24.963
<b>- It comes back to what we said.</b>

16:25.030 --> 16:26.732
<b>If you have a weak link, you</b>

16:41.747 --> 16:43.515
<b>- Welcome to the elimination</b>
<b>tattoo.</b>

16:43.582 --> 16:47.853
<b>Based on your work, one</b>
<b>shop will lose their shot at</b>

16:47.986 --> 16:52.891
<b>$200,000 and the first-ever</b>
<b>title of Master Shop.</b>

16:52.991 --> 16:54.860
<b>Bubba, as</b>
<b>the veteran artist,</b>

16:54.993 --> 16:56.862
<b>it's on</b>
<b>your shop to prove that you</b>

16:56.995 --> 16:59.698
<b>deserve to be back in this</b>
<b>competition by proving that you</b>

16:59.765 --> 17:02.000
<b>have overcome your weaknesses.</b>

17:02.034 --> 17:06.538
<b>In Bubba's honor, you'll all be</b>
<b>judged on the fundamentals.</b>

17:06.605 --> 17:09.208
<b>There's no better way to show</b>
<b>your fundamentals</b>

17:09.273 --> 17:11.175
<b>than by</b>
<b>tattooing a style that leaves</b>

17:11.242 --> 17:15.781
<b>you no room for errors,</b>
<b>illustrative black work.</b>

17:15.848 --> 17:18.317
<b>- Ooh.</b>

17:18.383 --> 17:20.252
<b>- Yeah, bring it on.</b>

17:20.319 --> 17:22.588
<b>- Using only lines of different</b>
<b>lengths and widths, you must</b>

17:22.654 --> 17:26.258
<b>create texture, depth, and</b>
<b>contrast in your image.</b>

17:26.325 --> 17:28.227
<b>Since</b>
<b>there's no color or shading,</b>

17:28.292 --> 17:32.498
<b>the smallest flaw in your</b>
<b>fundamentals will be obvious.</b>

17:32.564 --> 17:35.367
<b>- Line work? Cake. I'm ready to</b>
<b>prove myself.</b>

17:35.434 --> 17:37.469
<b>- We're looking for line weight.</b>
<b>You can't just sit there</b>

17:37.536 --> 17:39.805
<b>and--just 'cause you can only</b>
<b>use a liner needle doesn't mean</b>

17:39.872 --> 17:41.607
<b>you can still color in an area.</b>

17:41.673 --> 17:44.476
<b>Any areas of solid black is out</b>
<b>of this challenge.</b>

17:44.543 --> 17:47.713
<b>- You have to be really good at</b>
<b>lining with a tattoo machine.</b>

17:47.780 --> 17:49.982
<b> <i>You can't use any kind of</i> </b>
<b> <i>shading.</i> </b>

17:49.982 --> 17:52.084
<b>Every imperfection is</b>
<b>going to stand out.</b>

17:52.151 --> 17:55.821
<b>- And for this tattoo, you'll</b>
<b>once again be tag-teaming.</b>

17:55.888 --> 17:58.090
<b>Your</b>
<b>shop will create one tattoo</b>

17:58.157 --> 17:59.691
<b>on the same canvas.</b>

17:59.758 --> 18:02.161
<b>Only one of</b>
<b>you can tattoo at a time,</b>

18:02.227 --> 18:06.365
<b>and you must switch artists</b>
<b>every hour,</b>

18:06.432 --> 18:09.701
<b>and there's one other</b>
<b>thing that you should know.</b>

18:09.768 --> 18:13.038
<b>We aren't the only ones who'll</b>
<b>be judging you today.</b>

18:13.105 --> 18:16.542
<b>After every elimination tattoo,</b>
<b>all of you</b>

18:16.608 --> 18:18.377
<b>will form the jury of peers.</b>

18:18.444 --> 18:20.379
<b>- Ooh.</b>
<b>- [bleep].</b>

18:20.446 --> 18:23.415
<b>- You'll deliberate and choose</b>
<b>one shop to put for elimination.</b>

18:23.482 --> 18:24.983
<b>- Oh.</b>
<b>- Ooh.</b>

18:25.050 --> 18:26.518
<b>There's a good side to this.</b>

18:26.585 --> 18:28.320
<b> <i>If somebody's being a real dick,</i> </b>

18:28.387 --> 18:29.955
<b>it'd be a quick way to get them</b>
<b>out.</b>

18:30.022 --> 18:31.256
<b>- Let's meet your canvases.</b>

18:31.323 --> 18:34.259
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

18:34.326 --> 18:37.129
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

<b>You have the</b>

<b>If you want to get ahead in</b>
<b>this competition,</b>

18:44.636 --> 18:46.672
<b>strategy is fundamental.</b>

18:46.739 --> 18:48.640
<b>Go ahead and</b>
<b>assign the canvases.</b>

18:48.707 --> 18:50.476
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

<b>- What are you thinking about</b>

18:54.346 --> 18:55.481
<b>- Octopus underwater scene.</b>

18:55.547 --> 18:57.216
<b>- We want to send a message.</b>

<b>We're definitely a force to be</b>

<b>caught by his toe on my leg.</b>

19:02.521 --> 19:04.256
<b>- (whispers) Ooh, Jesus.</b>

19:04.323 --> 19:05.791
<b>- Eeny, meeny, miney, moe, catch</b>
<b>a tiger by his toe?</b>

19:07.059 --> 19:09.328
<b>- I want a black work demonic</b>
<b>goat head</b>

<b>with a crescent moon,</b>
<b>roses, and a raven on my ribs.</b>

19:13.298 --> 19:15.033
<b>- Ooh. Oh.</b>

19:15.100 --> 19:16.935
<b>- [bleep].</b>

19:17.002 --> 19:19.171
<b>The ribs is probably one of the</b>
<b>hardest areas to tattoo.</b>

19:19.238 --> 19:20.572
<b> <i>You're</i> </b>
<b> <i>constantly breathing.</i> </b>

19:20.639 --> 19:22.174
<b>You're</b>

19:24.176 --> 19:26.645
<b> <i>that person has to be still as</i> </b>

19:26.712 --> 19:28.247
<b>- I want a black work hand and</b>

<b>On the</b>

<b>the leaves will be a little bit</b>
<b>more full,</b>

19:39.091 --> 19:40.793
<b>and then the other side,</b>
<b>they'll be, like, falling off</b>

19:40.859 --> 19:42.494

19:43.529 --> 19:44.997

19:49.535 --> 19:51.403
<b>- Swear to God.</b>

<b>Good luck.</b>

<b>with a design challenge.</b>

<b>suspending him by, like,</b>

21:21.293 --> 21:22.828
<b>one--like, a back toe.</b>

21:22.928 --> 21:24.296
<b>- I have no idea how to do this</b>
<b>tattoo.</b>

21:24.363 --> 21:25.297
<b>- How much space you trying to</b>
<b>work with?</b>

21:25.364 --> 21:26.765
<b>- Well, um...</b>

21:26.832 --> 21:27.833
<b>probably all the way down to</b>
<b>here, right?</b>

21:27.933 --> 21:29.268
<b>- That'd be huge, man.</b>

21:29.334 --> 21:31.036
<b>- Well, if we're not gonna go</b>
<b>big,</b>

21:31.103 --> 21:32.471
<b>then we really can't wrap it;</b>
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

21:32.538 --> 21:34.039
<b>- Why not?</b>

21:34.106 --> 21:35.741
<b>- It's not gonna wrap if it's</b>
<b>small.</b>

21:35.808 --> 21:37.576
<b>- After this bad flash</b>
<b>challenge that we had</b>

21:37.643 --> 21:39.511
<b>and the stuff that we've been</b>
<b>going through as a team,</b>

21:39.578 --> 21:41.847
<b> <i>her nitpicking and demanding</i> </b>
<b> <i>this and demanding that</i> </b>

<b>If it's smaller...</b>
<b>- It won't wrap.</b>

21:44.817 --> 21:45.751
<b>- And it won't look right.</b>

21:45.818 --> 21:46.852
<b>- Why?</b>

21:49.955 --> 21:51.123
<b>- Can we hear your idea again?</b>

21:51.190 --> 21:52.691
<b>- It's an anatomical heart...</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

21:52.758 --> 21:55.461
<b>- With a tree growing out of it.</b>
<b>On the one side of the tree,</b>

21:55.527 --> 21:57.463
<b>the leaves'll be a little bit</b>
<b>more full, and on the other</b>

21:57.529 --> 21:59.832
<b>side they'll kind of be, like,</b>
<b>falling off, almost kind of</b>

21:59.965 --> 22:02.201
<b>like a death kind of feel.</b>

22:02.267 --> 22:04.636
<b>- Are you willing to, like, work</b>
<b>with us,</b>

22:04.703 --> 22:06.972
<b>maybe not putting</b>
<b>certain things in?</b>

22:07.005 --> 22:08.741
<b>- As long as you can work with</b>
<b>me.</b>

22:08.807 --> 22:10.642
<b>- She's not budging.</b>

22:10.709 --> 22:13.145
<b>She has her mind set on how she</b>
<b>wants the tattoo to look.</b>

22:13.212 --> 22:15.180
<b>- Do you guys have some</b>
<b>portfolios I could see?</b>

22:15.247 --> 22:16.982
<b>- This is gonna suck.</b>

22:20.206 --> 22:23.143
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

22:23.209 --> 22:24.578
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

<b>- I can. This is a team.</b>

22:28.114 --> 22:30.050
<b>I don't want to draw this and</b>
<b>then you come in and say, "Hey,</b>

22:30.116 --> 22:31.785
<b>I don't like this. Change this."</b>

22:31.851 --> 22:34.154
<b>And that's why I want to get</b>
<b>your input now.</b>

22:34.220 --> 22:36.122
<b>- The tentacles have to be</b>
<b>consistent.</b>

22:36.189 --> 22:37.791
<b>- These are from the reference.</b>

22:37.857 --> 22:39.859
<b>- That's why I didn't really</b>
<b>want to use reference.</b>

22:39.926 --> 22:42.162
<b>- Okay, well, I think it's best</b>
<b>that you finish your drawing,</b>

22:42.228 --> 22:44.798
<b>and then I'll just finish mine,</b>
<b>and we can just do it that way.</b>

22:44.864 --> 22:48.068
<b>- Bang is designing her tattoo</b>
<b>like it's the tattoo</b>

22:48.134 --> 22:49.235
<b> <i>that we're gonna do.</i> </b>

22:49.302 --> 22:51.071
<b>That's not happening.</b>

<b>If my design is stronger, we</b>

<b>- This.</b>

22:56.576 --> 23:01.147
<b>Okay, well, it has, like, a</b>
<b>realistic feel. Just--</b>

23:01.214 --> 23:02.749
<b>- Okay, so we're not doing this</b>
<b>one, pretty much.</b>

23:02.816 --> 23:06.886
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

30:20.473 --> 30:22.776
<b>With all these lines in</b>

30:24.711 --> 30:26.413
<b>There's not a lot of</b>

37:33.555 --> 37:36.024
<b>- It's ridiculous. Do your best</b>
<b>tattoos, and let your work</b>

37:36.091 --> 37:37.726
<b>speak for itself.</b>

37:37.792 --> 37:39.361
<b>You guys put up somebody that</b>
<b>you're threatened by.</b>

37:39.427 --> 37:41.262
<b>I think</b>
<b>you wasted your [bleep] time.</b>

37:41.329 --> 37:43.398
<b>- I'm pretty sure that they're</b>
<b>not going anywhere today.</b>

37:43.465 --> 37:46.568
<b>- 100%.</b>

37:46.568 --> 37:47.936
<b>- So shall we move on?</b>

37:48.003 --> 37:49.571
<b>- Yes, sir.</b>
<b>- Yep.</b>

37:49.604 --> 37:51.373
<b>- Okay, let's get into</b>
<b>Tri-Cities Tattoo.</b>

37:51.439 --> 37:53.808
<b>- You did come a little bit</b>
<b>stronger with the design,</b>

37:53.875 --> 37:56.945
<b>but it's pretty clear this is a</b>
<b>bottom tattoo.</b>

37:57.012 --> 37:59.748
<b>- The purpose of this challenge</b>
<b>was to create a tattoo showing</b>

37:59.814 --> 38:01.583
<b>depth through line work.</b>

38:01.583 --> 38:03.018
<b>We created depth.</b>

38:03.084 --> 38:04.185
<b>We have a foreground,</b>
<b>a middle ground,</b>

38:04.252 --> 38:05.954
<b>and a background.</b>

38:06.021 --> 38:07.622
<b>- But you have a lot of sloppy</b>
<b>line work here.</b>

38:07.689 --> 38:09.658
<b>Lines are crossing over.</b>
<b>Lines are mismatching.</b>

38:09.724 --> 38:12.327
<b>- There are examples of some</b>
<b>solid line work also.</b>

38:12.394 --> 38:14.362
<b>- You ain't pulled a clean line</b>
<b>since you've been here.</b>

38:14.429 --> 38:15.697
<b>- I'ma eat the [bleep] out of</b>
<b>your tattoo, bruh.</b>

38:15.764 --> 38:17.065
<b>- Yeah, eat it up.</b>

38:17.132 --> 38:19.000
<b>- The Marked Society.</b>

38:19.067 --> 38:21.569
<b>- The bulk of your disability in</b>
<b>this tattoo is the design.</b>

38:21.636 --> 38:23.638
<b>- It's been a hell of a week,</b>
<b>you know, dealing with personal</b>

38:23.705 --> 38:25.674
<b>problems and just trying to get</b>
<b>in a groove.</b>

38:25.740 --> 38:28.343
<b>- The biggest thing that would</b>
<b>make it hard for me to see you</b>

38:28.410 --> 38:30.979
<b>guys being Master Shop is the</b>
<b>fact that this tiger</b>

38:31.046 --> 38:33.048
<b>is so far off.</b>

38:33.114 --> 38:35.216
<b>It's odd.</b>

38:35.283 --> 38:37.886
<b>It's a tough decision, because</b>
<b>both of your teams</b>

38:37.952 --> 38:40.755
<b>are parallel on problems.</b>

38:40.822 --> 38:43.224
<b>- But we created depth.</b>
<b>They have a flat image.</b>

38:43.291 --> 38:45.660
<b>At least with</b>
<b>our tattoo you could tell--</b>

38:45.727 --> 38:48.363
<b>Let me--can I finish talking?</b>
<b>I feel like with ours you can</b>

38:48.430 --> 38:50.598
<b>at least tell what it is; our</b>
<b>drawing was flawless.</b>

38:50.665 --> 38:52.567
<b>We didn't</b>
<b>stumble on the anatomy.</b>

38:52.634 --> 38:54.369
<b>- Just 'cause they didn't call</b>
<b>your octopus out for anatomy</b>

38:54.436 --> 38:56.104
<b>doesn't mean it's anatomically</b>
<b>correct.</b>

38:56.171 --> 38:57.572
<b>- You don't know how to draw.</b>
<b>- Guys, guys.</b>

38:57.605 --> 38:58.606
<b>- That son of a bitch got 15</b>
<b>legs.</b>

38:58.673 --> 39:00.275
<b>- Bang.</b>
<b>- Yes?</b>

39:00.342 --> 39:02.010
<b>- Listen, at the end of the day,</b>
<b>we're looking</b>

39:02.077 --> 39:04.512
<b>at the finished tattoo.</b>
<b>It's a stumble.</b>

39:04.512 --> 39:06.915
<b>- All right, it is time to</b>
<b>determine who's going home.</b>

39:08.416 --> 39:10.385
<b>- This actually is a tough call.</b>

39:10.518 --> 39:12.120
<b>I know the tiger is jacked.</b>

39:12.187 --> 39:14.155
<b>I know the octopus looks more</b>
<b>like a octopus,</b>

39:14.222 --> 39:18.159
<b>and for Marked Society, they do</b>
<b>have some cleaner lines.</b>

39:18.226 --> 39:20.628
<b>I don't know.</b>

39:20.695 --> 39:22.530
<b>- Chris?</b>
<b>- Marked Society.</b>

39:22.530 --> 39:24.165
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

39:24.232 --> 39:25.900
<b>- My vote is also Marked</b>
<b>Society.</b>

39:25.967 --> 39:27.769
<b>Oliver?</b>

39:27.836 --> 39:29.304
<b>- I guess I'm gonna go with</b>
<b>Marked Society as well.</b>

39:29.371 --> 39:30.905
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

39:30.972 --> 39:33.575
<b>- The judges have decided</b>
<b>that Marked Society,</b>

39:33.641 --> 39:36.244
<b>you do not have what it takes to</b>
<b>be Master Shop.</b>

39:38.146 --> 39:40.982
<b>- Your outline and your drawing</b>
<b>are the framework for</b>

39:41.049 --> 39:42.984
<b>everything that goes in them,</b>
<b>so if you can't get those</b>

39:43.051 --> 39:44.853
<b>things together in this</b>
<b>competition,</b>

39:44.919 --> 39:47.455
<b>then I think rightfully you guys</b>
<b>are in the right place.</b>

39:47.555 --> 39:50.125
<b>- Please pack your machines and</b>
<b>move out.</b>

39:50.191 --> 39:54.596
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

39:54.663 --> 39:56.097
<b>- I'm a little disappointed,</b>
<b>man.</b>

39:56.164 --> 39:57.832
<b>- Yeah, I'm disappointed too,</b>
<b>bro.</b>

39:57.899 --> 39:59.768
<b>- We didn't get to show a</b>
<b>fraction of what we were</b>

39:59.834 --> 40:01.670
<b>capable of doing.</b>

40:01.736 --> 40:03.505
<b>- I should have never even let</b>
<b>that thing leave paper.</b>

40:03.538 --> 40:05.173
<b>I don't know what the</b>
<b>hell I was thinking, dude.</b>

40:05.240 --> 40:06.941
<b>- Dude, it's the pressure of the</b>
<b>situation, man.</b>

40:07.008 --> 40:08.643
<b>- This is not your normal,</b>
<b>average tattoo shop.</b>

40:08.710 --> 40:11.112
<b>We didn't expect the chaos of</b>
<b>this competition.</b>

40:11.179 --> 40:12.681
<b>- Let's get the hell out of</b>
<b>here.</b>

40:12.747 --> 40:13.782
<b>- Give me a hug.</b>
<b>Pleasure doing this with you.</b>

40:13.848 --> 40:15.083
<b>- Yeah. Love you, bro.</b>

40:15.150 --> 40:16.518
<b>- Love you too.</b>

40:16.584 --> 40:18.019
<b>We just couldn't get it to</b>
<b>click.</b>

40:18.086 --> 40:20.055
<b>- Let's go home and kill it,</b>
<b>Mikey.</b>

40:24.859 --> 40:28.096
<b> <i>announcer: On the next episode</i> </b>

40:28.163 --> 40:29.798

40:29.864 --> 40:31.333
<b>- You think I was competing with</b>
<b>you on the--</b>

40:31.399 --> 40:32.867
<b>- This doesn't [bleep] work for</b>
<b>me.</b>

40:32.934 --> 40:34.369
<b>- That looks [bleep] sloppy.</b>

40:34.436 --> 40:35.837
<b>- That's not true at all.</b>

40:35.904 --> 40:38.006
<b>Instead of shooting down my</b>
<b>stuff...</b>

40:38.073 --> 40:39.708
<b>- You're throwing a fit.</b>

40:39.774 --> 40:41.242
<b>- There's, like, 700 windows in</b>
<b>there.</b>

40:41.309 --> 40:43.211
<b>- Pedal to the metal, guys.</b>

<b> <i>- We might have bit off more</i> </b>

40:45.246 --> 40:47.182

40:47.248 --> 40:48.850
<b>'Cause that's what I thought I</b>
<b>was here to do.</b>

40:48.917 --> 40:50.986
