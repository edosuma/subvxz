15:53.562 --> 15:56.351
Well, those terms get thrown around...

15:56.352 --> 15:57.901
by the schools I attended.

15:57.902 --> 16:00.901
- What's in the case?
- William, that's rude.

16:00.902 --> 16:03.191
If Mr. Young wants to tell us
what's in his weird case

16:03.192 --> 16:04.981
that has us all
a little nervous, he will.

16:04.982 --> 16:08.771
Actually, this is
a detective kit I put together.

16:08.772 --> 16:12.731
Besides my job, I also fancy
myself an amateur sleuth.

16:12.732 --> 16:15.351
- I use chemistry to solve mysteries.
- Cool.

16:15.352 --> 16:18.401
So I'm guessing
you're a single fella, Grover?

16:18.402 --> 16:21.561
Ah, I'm married to a little lady
called forensic science.

16:21.562 --> 16:23.191
- [Laughter]
- Oh. [Laughs] So single?

16:23.192 --> 16:26.021
Yeah. In fact,
I'm on my way to a meeting

16:26.022 --> 16:29.392

the Sherlock Home-bodies.

16:29.417 --> 16:30.635
Whoa. Whoa.

What is it? Have your detective's
skills stumbled on something?

16:37.852 --> 16:40.351
I can't answer questions
about an open investigation.

16:40.352 --> 16:44.811
Something about this table
is not... on the level.

16:44.812 --> 16:46.731
Whoa, you're good.

16:46.732 --> 16:48.731
There's nothing wrong with the table.

17:08.311 --> 17:10.351
- May I be excused?
- Sure, honey.

17:10.352 --> 17:12.351
Well, your friend seems
to be on to something.

17:12.352 --> 17:14.651
How fortunate you invited him
to stop by tonight.

17:14.652 --> 17:16.651
Yeah. What are the odds?

17:16.652 --> 17:20.271
From the damage in the wood
grain and these carpet fibers,

17:20.271 --> 17:24.271
I can conclusively say somebody
stood on this table

17:24.271 --> 17:26.810
and broke it, and they tried
to cover their tracks

17:26.811 --> 17:28.441
with a shoddy repair job.

Not quite anyone.

17:36.562 --> 17:39.561
Check this out.

17:39.562 --> 17:41.691
There's a fingerprint on this nail.

17:41.692 --> 17:44.941
And judging from these ridge patterns,

17:44.942 --> 17:49.851
I would say this print could
only come from a blond child.

17:49.852 --> 17:51.651
I'm not sure
that's how fingerprints work.

17:51.652 --> 17:53.851
Hey, when you get a stupid hobby
like Mr. Young,

17:53.852 --> 17:55.061
then you can become an expert, too.

17:55.062 --> 17:58.481
A blond child? Sure narrows it down.

17:58.482 --> 18:00.481
Baby Andy's also kind of blonde.

Wow. What's that chemical?

18:19.272 --> 18:20.651
It's red dye number 40.

18:20.652 --> 18:23.021
It disrupts the chemical bonds
of this fiber

18:23.022 --> 18:24.651
down to the molecular level.

18:24.652 --> 18:26.521

First time in my life I had
the impulse to help someone.

that works off the books,

the rocket's gonna go up.

20:16.062 --> 20:19.021
Or, more precisely,
forty to fifty feet in the air,

20:19.022 --> 20:21.611
then deploy a parachute and
gently waft back down to Earth.

20:21.612 --> 20:24.771

a cricket inside... for science.
