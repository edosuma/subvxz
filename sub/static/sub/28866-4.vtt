00:34.267 --> 00:36.031
Yeah.
Uh, police, please.

00:36.033 --> 00:39.033
There's something by the river.
I think it's a body.

00:42.067 --> 00:44.198
What's the boss doing here?

00:44.200 --> 00:47.367
Could be his wife.
Same general description.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.100
<i>Boss.</i>

01:12.300 --> 01:13.765
<i>Wait.</i>

01:13.767 --> 01:14.968
<i>Hold up.</i>

01:25.033 --> 01:27.033
Why don't you stay here, eh?

01:52.701 --> 01:54.665
Stab wound?

01:54.667 --> 01:56.000
Kitchen knife maybe.

02:15.834 --> 02:17.634
Someone else's tragedy.

02:35.901 --> 02:37.868
First impressions?

02:38.868 --> 02:40.098
Perfect dump site.

02:40.100 --> 02:43.165
Close enough to park up.

02:43.167 --> 02:44.934
Not too overlooked.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.131
She was found really easily.

02:48.133 --> 02:50.200
I think this was done
in a rush.

02:51.434 --> 02:53.100
She was wrapped up
in this sheeting.

02:54.100 --> 02:57.899
Weighted down with these...
from a garden, probably.

02:57.901 --> 03:01.801
The rope wasn't tied well,
so it's come loose.

03:04.567 --> 03:06.799
What does this tell you?

03:06.801 --> 03:08.067
Billie?

03:09.334 --> 03:12.632
Probable cause of death,
a stab wound to the upper chest,

03:12.634 --> 03:15.732
but no hole in the clothing,
so she was dressed postmortem.

03:15.734 --> 03:16.765
Mm-hmm.

03:16.767 --> 03:20.165
Okay, the engraving
on the necklace,

03:20.167 --> 03:22.098
that could help us track down
who ordered it.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.298
Maybe we can find out
the victim's I.D. that way.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.198
Take a while to search through
all the jewelers.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.031
No, there's no need.
It's a Monica Vareesi.

03:28.033 --> 03:31.031
You can tell by
their trademark adjustable chain

03:31.033 --> 03:32.866
and the initials on the clasp.

03:32.868 --> 03:35.033
Trademark adjustable chain, eh?

03:36.300 --> 03:39.434
I've got a thing for expensive
jewelry I can't afford.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.265
Lack of decomp
would suggest the body

03:49.267 --> 03:50.998
wasn't in the water long.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.031
A local resident thought he saw
a white 4x4

03:54.033 --> 03:58.332
parked up by the river
at around 1:30 a.m.

03:58.334 --> 04:00.832
That would tie in with when
we think the body was dumped.

04:00.834 --> 04:03.665
Helps narrow down
the CCTV searches.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.998
Where are we
with the victim I.D.?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.165
Oh, ah, the necklace
she was wearing

04:08.167 --> 04:11.665
was ordered by a Patrick Morrell
five years ago,

04:11.667 --> 04:14.198
and it was delivered to
a solicitors firm in the city.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.932
We're fairly sure
it's the victim's father.

04:15.934 --> 04:17.165
Billie?

04:17.166 --> 04:19.932
Patrick Morrell died
just over three years ago.

04:19.934 --> 04:21.531
But I spoke
to an old work colleague,

04:21.534 --> 04:23.899
and Mr. Morrell had a daughter.

04:23.901 --> 04:27.232
Her name was Virginia,
but she went by Ginny.

04:27.234 --> 04:30.031
The necklace design's
the letter G.

04:30.033 --> 04:32.632
Checks on Open Source
show two Virginia Morrells

04:32.634 --> 04:33.465
living in London.

04:33.467 --> 04:35.732
One's 87.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.499
The other shares a flat
with a Tara Watson.

04:38.501 --> 04:40.868
She runs a dating agency.

04:47.734 --> 04:50.465
Can you think of anyone
she might have been meeting

04:50.467 --> 04:52.434
after work yesterday?

04:55.367 --> 04:57.234
The thing is, Ginny doesn't...

04:58.701 --> 05:01.234
...didn't really have
anyone in her life.

05:03.434 --> 05:05.634
She moved back from Manchester
last year.

05:07.901 --> 05:09.899
She'd left her husband.

05:09.901 --> 05:12.367
So she wasn't seeing
anyone new?

05:17.667 --> 05:19.165
Maybe.

05:19.167 --> 05:23.234
Maybe there...
Maybe there was someone.

05:23.734 --> 05:24.932
<i>I'm Harry.</i>

05:24.934 --> 05:28.332
<i>I am precisely
30-something years old.</i>

05:28.334 --> 05:31.532
<i>Six foot tall,
and I work in the City.</i>

05:31.534 --> 05:34.332
<i>Please don't respond if
you're not looking for someone</i>

05:34.334 --> 05:38.866
<i>who has impeccable manners,
who loves to laugh.</i>

05:38.868 --> 05:40.267
<i>Out loud.</i>

05:41.300 --> 05:43.332
<i>I attended Julian College.</i>

05:43.334 --> 05:46.031
<i>I have mingled with royalty,</i>

05:46.033 --> 05:50.165
<i>but now I am looking
to find my princess.</i>

05:50.167 --> 05:51.432
<i>So...</i>

05:51.434 --> 05:55.234
<i>RS VP.</i>

05:58.400 --> 06:00.699
Miss Watson said Ginny needed
cheering up

06:00.701 --> 06:02.499
after her marriage went south.

06:02.501 --> 06:03.565
D.C. Brady.

06:03.567 --> 06:06.732
She wanted to fix her up
with a nice chap.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.465
And how many dates had
she'd been on with Shelston?

06:09.467 --> 06:11.131
Three or four.

06:11.133 --> 06:13.098
But Ginny stopped it

06:13.100 --> 06:14.866
because she wasn't ready,
according to Watson.

06:14.868 --> 06:17.098
Yeah, okay.
Cheers for that.

06:17.100 --> 06:20.765
The call log on Ginny's phone
shows an incoming call

06:20.767 --> 06:23.298
from the home number
at Shelston's address yesterday.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.098
Just after 2:00 p.m.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.767
Sounds like Ginny
might have changed her mind.

06:45.834 --> 06:48.665
What's so special
about Julian College anyway?

06:48.667 --> 06:51.167
Boarding school near Dartmoor.
Minor royals go there.

06:52.033 --> 06:54.332
- What?
- White 4x4.

06:54.334 --> 06:55.901
Matches the car
at the dump site.

07:10.834 --> 07:12.767
Rob?

07:14.634 --> 07:16.232
Do those rocks
look like the ones

07:16.234 --> 07:18.234
that were used
to weigh down the victim?

07:26.801 --> 07:28.067
There's a body down here.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.732
Yeah, ambulance required.

07:33.734 --> 07:36.866
Yeah, it's 2 Cromfell Place.

07:36.868 --> 07:39.332
That's SW7 9VC.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.665
Yeah.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.534
We're just gaining access
to the property.

07:46.067 --> 07:48.400
It's Harry Shelston.
He's dead.

07:56.067 --> 07:57.866
The car belongs
to an Alex Barker.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.499
He also owns the house.

07:59.501 --> 08:02.098
What? I thought this
Shelston guy was loaded.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.031
What's he doing
living in someone else's house

08:04.033 --> 08:05.601
and driving their car?

08:08.234 --> 08:10.200
So Ginny died in the bedroom.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.365
Some kind of sex game
gone wrong?

08:15.367 --> 08:17.232
He stuck her in the river,

08:17.234 --> 08:19.866
then came back here
and blew his brains out?

08:19.868 --> 08:22.599
You know, there's something
strange about this room.

08:22.601 --> 08:26.065
It's like it's been stripped
of everything personal.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.765
Maybe that added
to the fantasy.

08:27.767 --> 08:31.365
Keys for the 4x4
parked outside.

08:31.367 --> 08:33.832
Now, if he used that

08:33.833 --> 08:35.599
to move Ginny's body,

08:35.601 --> 08:37.467
there'll be some forensics.

08:46.267 --> 08:48.734
No I.D. on the girl
with your wife's bag yet, then?

08:49.801 --> 08:52.198
Well, the angle doesn't help.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.866
Misper are checking other CCTV.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.868
With luck
they'll get a better one.

08:59.534 --> 09:01.534
We'll find out who she is.

09:04.133 --> 09:06.000
Briefing in five minutes.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.765
She seems a bit off.

09:12.767 --> 09:16.267
Might be time for a chat,
as her line manager.

09:18.234 --> 09:19.300
It's just a thought.

09:30.067 --> 09:31.465
Amber, it's me.

09:31.467 --> 09:34.832
Um, look, I'm really sorry
about the way we left things.

09:34.834 --> 09:38.031
I do like you.
I just...

09:38.033 --> 09:40.067
Listen, call me back.
It's important.

09:43.601 --> 09:44.765
Everything all right?

09:44.767 --> 09:47.165
Yeah, just thinking
about the case.

09:47.167 --> 09:50.532
Okay, if there is anything
in your private life

09:50.534 --> 09:51.932
that's affecting your work...

09:51.934 --> 09:54.031
No, no.

09:54.033 --> 09:55.365
It's just a problem
with a friend.

09:55.367 --> 09:56.398
I'm trying to help.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.665
Okay.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.467
Shouldn't keep
the boss waiting.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.932
Matches of
Virginia Morrell's blood

10:06.934 --> 10:10.398
were found at the crime scene
and in the 4x4,

10:10.400 --> 10:12.634
proving it was used
to transport the body.

10:13.634 --> 10:17.031
Now, this is backed up
with roadside CCTV,

10:17.033 --> 10:19.465
which caught the car
on its way to the dump site

10:19.467 --> 10:21.334
at 1:13 a.m.

10:23.167 --> 10:26.400
It looks like
we've got a murder-suicide.

10:27.701 --> 10:30.232
Harry Shelston
killed Virginia Morrell,

10:30.234 --> 10:33.400
dumped her body, came home,
and then topped himself.

10:35.467 --> 10:38.267
Oh, and by the way, Vivienne
doesn't believe a word of this.

10:39.834 --> 10:42.632
Okay, well, why would he bother
trying to get rid of the body

10:42.634 --> 10:44.334
if he knew he was
gonna kill himself?

10:45.667 --> 10:48.200
I think we're looking
for someone else.

10:49.234 --> 10:52.198
CRIS report shows two past
callouts for domestic violence

10:52.200 --> 10:55.765
against Ginny's husband,
Sean Montgomery, in Manchester.

10:55.767 --> 10:59.765
He was cautioned for one
and arrested for a second one,

10:59.767 --> 11:02.198
but the charges were dismissed
for lack of evidence.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.632
Doesn't he still live up there?

11:03.634 --> 11:06.332
No.
He moved here two months ago.

11:06.334 --> 11:07.499
What,
so he could murder Ginny

11:07.501 --> 11:10.365
and frame her new boyfriend
for it?

11:10.367 --> 11:11.200
Maybe.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.031
Meanwhile, I've got Alex Barker
on his way in for interview.

11:17.033 --> 11:19.031
Hopefully he can share
his thoughts on evidence

11:19.033 --> 11:20.267
that we actually have.

11:22.868 --> 11:25.198
Billie, do you want
to interview the bloke

11:25.200 --> 11:27.398
that let Harry stay at his house
and use his car,

11:27.400 --> 11:29.899
or do you want to explore
the land of make-believe

11:29.901 --> 11:31.467
with Vivienne?

11:34.234 --> 11:36.632
Uh, SOCO found a receipt
in Harry's pocket

11:36.634 --> 11:39.765
for a wine bar in Chelsea
from last night.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.165
Thought I might look into CCTV

11:41.167 --> 11:43.098
and see if I might find Ginny
on there.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.367
If that's okay.

11:45.734 --> 11:46.934
Yeah, good call.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.165
Sean Montgomery?

11:55.167 --> 11:57.031
I'm Detective Inspector
David Bradford.

11:57.033 --> 11:59.232
This is Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole.

11:59.234 --> 12:01.267
Do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

12:02.434 --> 12:03.966
I can get one of the girls
to fetch you

12:03.968 --> 12:05.532
a coffee or tea if you like.

12:05.534 --> 12:07.332
No, thank you, Mr. Montgomery.

12:07.334 --> 12:10.131
We're here about your wife,
Virginia... Ginny.

12:10.133 --> 12:14.232
You do know she left me, right,
and we're separated?

12:14.234 --> 12:15.699
We were aware of that.

12:15.701 --> 12:18.232
When was the last time
you saw her?

12:18.234 --> 12:22.232
I haven't seen her since she
left about eight months ago.

12:22.234 --> 12:23.932
So you haven't made contact
with her

12:23.934 --> 12:25.131
since she came back to London?

12:25.133 --> 12:27.765
Too busy working.

12:27.767 --> 12:30.265
Can you tell us
where you were last night?

12:30.267 --> 12:31.998
Uh, it was my night off.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.701
I had some dinner, watched TV,
flaked out.

12:36.367 --> 12:37.398
What is this?

12:37.400 --> 12:39.966
Ginny was found dead
this morning.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.232
Someone stabbed her.

12:42.234 --> 12:44.834
So you understand why we need
to ask you these questions.

12:51.467 --> 12:53.998
Okay, um...

12:54.000 --> 12:55.234
Uh, just, um...

12:58.734 --> 13:00.732
Give me a moment to process.

13:00.734 --> 13:01.734
Okay?

13:05.300 --> 13:07.767
Was anyone with you
last night?

13:09.367 --> 13:11.499
No.

13:11.501 --> 13:13.966
What you're looking at me?

13:13.968 --> 13:15.665
We have a record of callouts

13:15.667 --> 13:17.532
to the property
that you shared with Ginny

13:17.534 --> 13:19.599
after allegations
of domestic abuse.

13:19.601 --> 13:21.832
Our investigation needs to
take that into account.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.532
All those charges were dropped.

13:23.534 --> 13:25.632
Hence the word "allegations."

13:25.634 --> 13:28.432
So all you have to do
is answer our questions.

13:28.434 --> 13:29.868
What's your side of it?

13:33.567 --> 13:36.565
Stuff gets said
in a marriage, right?

13:36.567 --> 13:39.632
You're trapped,
all the fun has stopped.

13:39.634 --> 13:41.398
You do stupid things.

13:41.400 --> 13:45.033
Like threatening your wife
with a knife?

13:46.734 --> 13:48.267
And there's this.

13:49.968 --> 13:52.332
We've a list of calls
made to Ginny's phone

13:52.334 --> 13:54.599
up to and on the day
that she died.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.432
Several hang-ups
from this place.

13:56.434 --> 14:00.234
You still want to deny
you made contact with Ginny?

14:01.901 --> 14:03.300
Look...

14:05.934 --> 14:09.067
I thought since we were in the
same town, we should meet up.

14:10.067 --> 14:12.499
But every time she answered,

14:12.501 --> 14:14.465
I lost my nerve.

14:14.467 --> 14:17.501
Hmm? That's it.

14:18.968 --> 14:21.465
Look, listen to me.

14:21.467 --> 14:26.334
I did not kill my wife.

14:38.534 --> 14:39.532
There you go.

14:39.534 --> 14:41.499
Thank you.

14:41.501 --> 14:43.767
This is a shock.

14:48.133 --> 14:49.868
I've known Harry since school.

14:50.934 --> 14:53.265
He was a good guy.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.398
We did a property deal together.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.332
So you're in property too?

14:57.334 --> 14:58.998
A little.
Not a career.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.998
You did better than Harry,
though, obviously.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.131
He lived at your house,
borrowed your car.

15:06.133 --> 15:08.300
Harry made some bad choices.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.501
Just with money?

15:11.701 --> 15:12.899
You have to understand,

15:12.901 --> 15:15.232
Harry had never worked
for anything in his life.

15:15.234 --> 15:18.300
He drifted.
Got by on charm.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.932
So...

15:21.934 --> 15:24.699
Harry's bad choices.

15:24.701 --> 15:25.901
Drugs?

15:29.601 --> 15:31.332
Harry's father had stopped
his allowance

15:31.334 --> 15:32.367
because of the cocaine.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.365
He was struggling.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.200
That's why I let him stay,
use the car.

15:38.567 --> 15:39.765
That's very generous of you.

15:39.767 --> 15:42.332
The house was empty.
Better someone be in it.

15:42.334 --> 15:45.465
Stop the place
from being broken into.

15:45.467 --> 15:48.267
You weren't worried
he'd sell all the furniture?

15:50.033 --> 15:52.699
Harry was promising
to get help.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.998
He was looking
to clear his debts,

15:55.000 --> 15:56.133
sort his life out.

15:57.133 --> 15:59.699
That why this is
such a tragedy.

15:59.701 --> 16:01.599
Did he have a phone
and a laptop?

16:01.601 --> 16:03.632
Yes, both.

16:03.634 --> 16:06.033
We didn't find them
in the house.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.400
Maybe he sold them.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.599
I occasionally gave him money.

16:11.601 --> 16:14.799
The last time I saw him,
which was Tuesday of last week,

16:14.801 --> 16:16.732
he was depressed.

16:16.734 --> 16:18.300
About losing his job.

16:20.634 --> 16:22.131
What job?

16:22.133 --> 16:23.801
All right, cheers, mate.

16:26.801 --> 16:30.232
So Harry was in deep debt
according to his bank.

16:30.234 --> 16:33.432
Also he wasn't a client
at Superior Singles.

16:33.434 --> 16:34.998
He was an employee.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.232
Well, at least he was

16:36.234 --> 16:39.532
until Tara Watson fired him
two weeks ago.

16:39.534 --> 16:41.632
How did you get on with the ex?

16:41.634 --> 16:44.065
Oh, he's been down here
in the same town as Ginny

16:44.067 --> 16:47.165
and claims he hasn't had
the nerve to speak to her.

16:47.167 --> 16:49.934
- As if.
- Tara Watson's here.

16:53.234 --> 16:57.065
We provide
a handsome, charming man

16:57.067 --> 17:00.932
to escort our client
to a party

17:00.934 --> 17:03.832
so she doesn't have to
turn up solo.

17:03.834 --> 17:07.298
And no-strings sex included?

17:07.300 --> 17:09.832
You can see why your service
might be misunderstood.

17:09.834 --> 17:11.632
No!

17:11.634 --> 17:12.699
Not at all.

17:12.701 --> 17:15.397
Look, if both parties
are amenable,

17:15.400 --> 17:17.165
then that's strictly
between themselves.

17:17.166 --> 17:21.934
Our service is only concerned
with the event.

17:24.534 --> 17:27.934
And it was using this service
that Ginny met Harry?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.467
She was only looking
for a confidence boost.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.499
Then Harry left the agency,
and that was that.

17:36.501 --> 17:39.434
Yeah, but he didn't leave.
Didn't you fire him?

17:42.400 --> 17:44.665
It was just time
for him to move on.

17:44.667 --> 17:47.701
Miss Watson,
Ginny was murdered.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.400
I know that.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.765
One of our clients...

18:01.767 --> 18:05.400
best clients... left the agency
after a date with him.

18:06.734 --> 18:10.534
She was too discreet
to say what had happened.

18:11.901 --> 18:13.000
It was obviously bad.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.200
What's her name?

18:17.534 --> 18:19.000
Corinna Richardson.

18:25.100 --> 18:28.031
Why did you leave the agency?

18:28.033 --> 18:29.732
Just wasn't for me anymore.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.532
Tara Watson thought it was to do
with Harry Shelston.

18:32.534 --> 18:35.734
Well, I never said that.

18:40.167 --> 18:44.198
So you've got nothing to tell us
about Harry Shelston?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.232
Like what?

18:45.234 --> 18:48.499
Like any threatening behavior?

18:48.501 --> 18:50.632
Odd sexual requests?

18:50.634 --> 18:52.232
No.

18:52.234 --> 18:54.866
No, Harry wasn't like that.

18:54.868 --> 18:59.232
We found some handcuffs
in Harry's bedroom.

18:59.234 --> 19:02.131
Was that something
he used with you?

19:02.133 --> 19:03.434
No.

19:05.868 --> 19:08.033
Why were you
at Harry's house?

19:09.367 --> 19:10.932
He was found dead
this morning.

19:10.934 --> 19:13.031
Possibly suicide.

19:13.033 --> 19:15.031
But we're investigating
his involvement

19:15.033 --> 19:17.734
in the death of another woman
he met through the agency.

19:20.634 --> 19:22.465
Harry?
That's not possible.

19:22.467 --> 19:24.198
What makes you say that?

19:24.200 --> 19:26.499
Well, Harry was sweet.

19:26.501 --> 19:28.267
Lost, actually.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.434
I can't help you at all.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.699
Now, I have to go.

19:34.701 --> 19:37.400
I have to, um...
I have to be somewhere.

19:49.934 --> 19:52.131
I watched right till the end.
All uneventful.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.532
And then I saw this.

19:53.534 --> 19:56.432
That's Ginny leaving
with Harry Shelston.

19:56.434 --> 19:57.801
Right, cheers, mate

20:01.367 --> 20:03.501
And that's her ex, Sean.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.667
Stalking her.

20:08.934 --> 20:10.966
That was the pathologist.

20:10.968 --> 20:12.632
She found marks
around Shelston's neck

20:12.634 --> 20:15.632
indicating a choke hold
to render someone unconscious.

20:15.634 --> 20:17.866
Harry Shelston
didn't shoot himself.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.467
The suicide was staged.

20:50.501 --> 20:52.033
So, what happened
after that, Sean?

20:53.133 --> 20:54.532
Did you follow them back?

20:54.534 --> 20:56.467
I was gonna follow them.

20:57.567 --> 21:00.434
They were waiting for a cab.

21:01.434 --> 21:04.131
I went to my car,
but some idiot blocked me in.

21:04.133 --> 21:07.067
Some guy using the cashpoint.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.499
Check out the camera
on the machine.

21:10.501 --> 21:12.932
I had words with him.

21:12.934 --> 21:17.465
When you're there,
check out the guy on the moped.

21:17.467 --> 21:19.765
He followed them down the road.

21:19.767 --> 21:20.834
Say that again.

21:22.133 --> 21:24.065
Some guy. Dodgy.

21:24.067 --> 21:26.866
He had a tattoo on his neck
and a bike helmet.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.734
I saw him watching them.

21:29.767 --> 21:32.332
And when they pulled off
in the cab,

21:32.334 --> 21:34.165
He rode after them.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.501
And you're only
telling us this now?

21:39.901 --> 21:42.868
I didn't want to
look like a stalker. Right?

21:44.434 --> 21:46.932
She was still mine.

21:46.934 --> 21:48.334
Do you get that?

21:49.667 --> 21:52.234
She was still my wife.

21:56.534 --> 22:00.932
This guy matches the
description that Sean gave us.

22:00.934 --> 22:03.131
So we're ruling out
the ex-husband.

22:03.133 --> 22:05.665
Uh, yeah, the cashpoint CCTV

22:05.667 --> 22:08.365
showed Sean kicking off at
the guy who... who boxed him in

22:08.367 --> 22:09.866
for a good 10 minutes.

22:09.868 --> 22:12.899
So it's looking unlikely
that he followed Ginny

22:12.901 --> 22:14.098
to Shelston's house.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.868
Which leaves us
with this moped guy.

22:18.567 --> 22:20.799
Why was he tailing him?

22:20.801 --> 22:24.165
We've had a hit on CRIMINT.
The tattoo was a winner.

22:24.167 --> 22:27.065
Lee Matthews, 27.

22:27.067 --> 22:29.932
Arrests for drug possession,
one count for burglary.

22:29.934 --> 22:31.465
Get the current address.

22:31.467 --> 22:34.200
Get him in.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.599
His mum says she hasn't seen him
since this morning.

22:43.601 --> 22:44.765
Sit and wait, then.

22:44.767 --> 22:48.200
You take the front.
I'll cover down here.

23:08.534 --> 23:11.332
I'm guessing that's not
your friend with the problem.

23:11.334 --> 23:13.632
Is this friend in the job
or a civvy?

23:13.634 --> 23:16.065
In the job.

23:16.067 --> 23:18.198
She's worried she might have
broken the rules.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.767
How?

23:20.767 --> 23:22.565
She got friendly

23:22.567 --> 23:24.033
with someone connected
with a case.

23:25.367 --> 23:26.901
Sexual friendly?

23:28.133 --> 23:31.167
No.
But she's been hanging out.

23:34.334 --> 23:35.966
Only now she's thinking
it might come out,

23:35.968 --> 23:37.298
and she's wondering
if she should

23:37.300 --> 23:38.499
come clean to her boss about it.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.232
No, she should
cut this friend loose

23:40.234 --> 23:42.300
before anyone
finds out about it.

23:43.434 --> 23:46.734
Protect herself
and her career.

23:48.734 --> 23:50.332
She's tried.
It's complicated.

23:50.334 --> 23:52.734
Yeah, well, she should try again
to uncomplicate it. Here he is.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.398
Lee Matthews?
I...

24:00.400 --> 24:02.699
Ohh!
Suspect on the run.

24:02.701 --> 24:04.832
Crossing under the railway line.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.300
Okay, he's heading towards you!

24:13.200 --> 24:14.599
Aah! Get off me.

24:14.601 --> 24:16.732
Lee Matthews, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

24:16.734 --> 24:18.732
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

24:18.734 --> 24:20.232
if you do not mention
when questioned

24:20.234 --> 24:21.665
something which you later
rely on in court.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.665
- I ain't done nothing.
- Oh, is that right?

24:23.667 --> 24:25.732
- I haven't done anything.
- Do you understand?

24:25.734 --> 24:27.934
Okay, then, let's see,
shall we?

24:29.467 --> 24:31.065
I'm holding that for a mate.

24:31.067 --> 24:32.267
Course you are.

24:35.734 --> 24:37.398
You've got phones,

24:37.400 --> 24:39.732
laptop, a purse, and a watch

24:39.734 --> 24:41.532
belonging to
two murdered people.

24:41.534 --> 24:45.332
CCTV picks you up at a wine bar
where they met for drink.

24:45.334 --> 24:48.198
A witness saw you following them
on your moped

24:48.200 --> 24:50.067
shortly before the murders.

24:56.567 --> 24:59.734
I saw the posh bloke and the
lady coming out of the wine bar.

25:00.968 --> 25:04.131
What, you just happened
to see them?

25:04.133 --> 25:06.398
I wait around outside,

25:06.400 --> 25:08.599
try and find a couple who look
like they got a few quid.

25:08.601 --> 25:10.400
I clocked them
'cause of his watch.

25:11.501 --> 25:13.265
Follow them home,

25:13.267 --> 25:14.699
wait for the light
to go on upstairs,

25:14.701 --> 25:15.998
and then when they're at it,

25:16.000 --> 25:19.265
I run in, take their stuff,
and then leave.

25:19.267 --> 25:23.098
Houses like that
you need people to be in.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.699
What, because the alarm's
not activated?

25:25.701 --> 25:28.699
I usually wait around
for a bit, you know?

25:28.701 --> 25:30.232
Really let them get going.

25:30.234 --> 25:32.332
But 10 minutes later,
he was back down.

25:32.334 --> 25:34.932
And then he comes out through
the front door carrying her,

25:34.934 --> 25:37.565
like she was unconscious
or out of it or whatever.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.465
You didn't think
that seemed strange?

25:39.467 --> 25:41.265
Well, it's not like he'd
rolled her up in a carpet

25:41.267 --> 25:42.532
and put her
in the boot of the car.

25:42.534 --> 25:44.799
She was dressed.

25:44.801 --> 25:47.866
I thought
she'd taken something.

25:47.868 --> 25:50.932
For all I knew, he was
taking her to the hospital.

25:50.934 --> 25:53.332
That's when I noticed
he'd left the front door open.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.398
So I went in,
and I helped myself.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.365
Did you go upstairs?

25:57.367 --> 25:58.966
No.

25:58.968 --> 26:01.198
I found enough downstairs.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.998
And then I didn't know
when he'd be back,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.432
so I ran off.

26:05.434 --> 26:07.367
And that's it.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.966
Put your face away.
You asked me what happened.

26:11.968 --> 26:13.334
I'm telling you.

26:16.067 --> 26:18.701
The little git's
lying through his teeth.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.701
I've been through
Harry's laptop.

26:22.667 --> 26:23.667
Come on.

26:26.801 --> 26:28.365
UK Reel Porn.

26:28.367 --> 26:30.899
It hosts videos of couples
covertly filmed having sex

26:30.901 --> 26:32.765
for the peeping Tom market.

26:32.767 --> 26:35.632
So Shelston likes
watching this stuff. And?

26:35.634 --> 26:39.031
You know you said
the bedroom felt impersonal.

26:39.033 --> 26:41.632
And there were a couple
of smoke detectors.

26:41.634 --> 26:44.534
I'm pretty sure there were
hidden cameras in them.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.167
That's Corinna Richardson.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.767
Let's have
another word with her.

27:10.734 --> 27:12.298
I've got Harry Shelston's
call log.

27:12.300 --> 27:15.632
On the days leading up to
and the day of the murders.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.665
Now, Harry made a call

27:17.667 --> 27:21.565
to an unlisted disposable phone
last night.

27:21.567 --> 27:23.232
Half an hour before
Ginny's body was dumped.

27:23.234 --> 27:25.765
So are you suggesting
that there could be

27:25.767 --> 27:26.932
a third person involved, Rob?

27:26.934 --> 27:29.699
Yeah, okay.
You've been right so far.

27:29.701 --> 27:31.067
Why stop now?

27:38.901 --> 27:40.565
What have you found out
about Alex Barker?

27:40.567 --> 27:44.065
Barker told us that he'd met
Harry at boarding school,

27:44.067 --> 27:45.832
so Billie checked
the school records.

27:45.834 --> 27:48.265
No record of an Alex Barker
at Julian College

27:48.267 --> 27:52.832
at the same time as Harry,
but I did find an Alexei Bakuri.

27:52.834 --> 27:55.765
Alexei Bakuri was found guilty
five years ago

27:55.767 --> 27:58.465
of a minor
drugs possession charge.

27:58.467 --> 28:00.265
Yeah, and of more significance,

28:00.267 --> 28:03.131
he is the nephew
of Artem Bakuri.

28:03.133 --> 28:08.031
Russian mafia, with ties to
drugs, pornography, et cetera.

28:08.033 --> 28:10.332
And he was arrested
but not charged

28:10.334 --> 28:12.665
for the murder of an associate
five years ago.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.801
The body was found
in the Thames.

28:16.334 --> 28:17.601
Let's get Bakuri in.

28:34.567 --> 28:37.765
Alex Barker,
also known as Alexei Bakuri,

28:37.767 --> 28:39.398
I'm Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole,

28:39.400 --> 28:41.599
and you've already met
my colleague Rob Brady.

28:41.601 --> 28:43.699
We're arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Harry Shelston.

28:43.701 --> 28:45.966
We've also got a warrant
to search your flat.

28:45.968 --> 28:47.334
I'm gonna caution you inside.

28:47.934 --> 28:48.968
Let's go.

28:56.701 --> 28:58.866
I changed my name
to avoid victimization...

28:58.868 --> 29:00.799
like this...

29:00.801 --> 29:03.131
due to a Russian surname.

29:03.133 --> 29:06.634
You mean having the same surname
as a convicted mob murderer?

29:07.634 --> 29:09.998
I think my uncle was targeted
because of

29:10.000 --> 29:11.868
certain cultural stereotypes.

29:13.100 --> 29:15.031
But I'm sure we'll agree
to differ on that.

29:15.033 --> 29:17.232
Let's talk about
your uncle's business,

29:17.234 --> 29:19.432
about his links to porn sites,

29:19.434 --> 29:23.432
in particular one called
UK Reel Porn.

29:23.434 --> 29:25.732
Did you know that
Harry Shelston, your friend,

29:25.734 --> 29:28.198
was supplying content
to that site?

29:28.200 --> 29:29.767
I did not.

29:31.067 --> 29:33.832
What, so videos were being made
at your house

29:33.834 --> 29:36.298
and ending up on sites
that your uncle had interest in?

29:36.300 --> 29:38.265
It's a bit of a coincidence.

29:38.267 --> 29:40.432
I don't know about
any of this.

29:40.434 --> 29:44.131
We suspect Harry Shelston
called you last night

29:44.133 --> 29:46.734
to help him move the body of a
woman who had just been stabbed.

29:48.133 --> 29:50.065
You can check my phone records.

29:50.067 --> 29:53.031
Oh, no, this call was made to
a disposable, untraceable phone

29:53.033 --> 29:55.300
which we believe
belongs to you.

29:57.267 --> 29:59.232
Have you ever owned a gun,
Mr. Bakuri?

30:00.934 --> 30:03.632
I'm Russian.

30:03.634 --> 30:06.632
My uncle was unfairly accused.

30:06.634 --> 30:08.434
I must be some kind of gangster.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.799
I'm a property developer.

30:13.801 --> 30:15.801
And I've never owned a gun.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.966
Anything from the search
on Bakuri's house?

30:19.968 --> 30:21.832
Phone and computer's clean.

30:21.834 --> 30:23.998
No sign of the memory stick
from the camera.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.998
We're examining clothes
for any gunshot residue,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.499
but the wardrobe's
pretty extensive,

30:28.501 --> 30:31.332
so it's gonna take some time.

30:31.334 --> 30:32.534
Okay, so we've got nothing.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.432
Corinna Richardson's
on her way in for interview.

30:45.367 --> 30:48.599
Um, sorry, do you mind
if I just take this?

30:48.601 --> 30:49.499
No. No.

30:49.501 --> 30:50.434
Thanks.

30:57.901 --> 30:59.434
Why haven't you called me back?

31:01.501 --> 31:03.932
I need to see you.

31:03.934 --> 31:05.400
Tonight?

31:09.968 --> 31:11.298
I heard David

31:11.300 --> 31:13.434
turned up at the crime scene
this morning.

31:14.734 --> 31:17.265
How's he been since?

31:17.267 --> 31:18.699
Okay.

31:18.701 --> 31:20.701
On the surface.

31:24.767 --> 31:28.799
Corinna, these videos
weren't made for personal use.

31:28.801 --> 31:32.901
Harry was supplying them
to a porn website for cash.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.067
Well, I don't believe that.

31:37.300 --> 31:38.834
I don't believe
Harry would do that.

32:02.601 --> 32:04.767
Look, stop protecting Harry.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.534
Tell us what happened
on your last date.

32:10.934 --> 32:12.934
Take your time.

32:18.334 --> 32:20.234
We were robbed.

32:21.501 --> 32:24.699
A man wearing a mask,
carrying a knife,

32:24.701 --> 32:28.000
got into the house
while we were upstairs.

32:31.434 --> 32:33.334
Then what happened?

32:36.133 --> 32:40.632
He made me hand over my handbag
and my jewelry.

32:40.634 --> 32:43.334
Harry had to hand over
his wallet and his watch.

32:44.901 --> 32:46.300
And then...

32:51.367 --> 32:54.832
He gave me
a set of handcuffs.

32:54.834 --> 32:58.601
He got me to cuff
Harry to the bed.

33:00.634 --> 33:03.701
Then he told me
to do things to Harry.

33:05.167 --> 33:06.934
Sexual things.

33:08.734 --> 33:10.968
I was so scared, I...

33:12.701 --> 33:15.966
He told me
to lie down on the bed,

33:15.968 --> 33:19.267
and I thought
he was gonna rape me.

33:22.601 --> 33:28.033
But we had to close our eyes
and count to a hundred, and...

33:30.734 --> 33:32.667
...then he was gone, and...

33:34.100 --> 33:37.300
And he left the keys
to the handcuffs on the floor.

33:40.067 --> 33:43.632
The man with the knife
wore a mask.

33:43.634 --> 33:45.567
Is there anything else
you remember?

33:47.467 --> 33:50.434
The mask was itching him.

33:51.434 --> 33:53.298
He kept scratching his neck,

33:53.300 --> 33:58.801
and, uh, there... there was
a tattoo there.

34:02.467 --> 34:04.198
We found your number.

34:04.200 --> 34:07.400
In the contacts list
on Harry Shelston's phone.

34:11.801 --> 34:13.799
I used to serve Harry
a bit of coke.

34:13.801 --> 34:16.599
That's how
we know each other.

34:16.601 --> 34:19.899
Anyway, he started getting it
from this other geezer.

34:19.900 --> 34:22.498
And when he kept
coming up short,

34:22.501 --> 34:25.599
this other geezer found
another way to make him pay.

34:25.601 --> 34:28.130
- Making sex tapes?
- Yeah.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.734
He knew Harry had
a constant supply of women.

34:31.900 --> 34:34.232
But after a while,

34:34.234 --> 34:38.197
Harry taping them having sex
with him, it weren't enough.

34:38.199 --> 34:41.866
He wanted something,
um, spicier.

34:41.868 --> 34:43.764
Like what?

34:43.766 --> 34:46.465
Like them getting robbed.

34:46.467 --> 34:50.130
And the robber getting them
to do stuff.

34:50.132 --> 34:52.634
What happened last night?

34:55.801 --> 34:58.732
Harry came downstairs
to make sure I'd got in.

34:58.734 --> 35:01.332
He said
there was jewelry and cash,

35:01.334 --> 35:04.300
that she had a necklace
but I was to let her keep it.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.934
Go on.

35:09.734 --> 35:11.799
He went back upstairs.

35:11.801 --> 35:13.732
They got down to it.

35:13.734 --> 35:18.332
I burst in, balaclava on,
waving a knife around.

35:18.334 --> 35:21.765
Grab up all the jewelry
and put it in my bag.

35:21.767 --> 35:23.732
And Harry offers up his watch

35:23.734 --> 35:26.167
so that she gets
to keep her necklace.

35:27.601 --> 35:30.198
And then I tell her
to cuff him to the bed.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.734
And you're still
holding the knife?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.065
Yeah.
And she took the cuffs.

35:39.067 --> 35:40.334
- Ginny?
- Yeah.

35:41.667 --> 35:43.298
But instead of hooking them up
to the bed,

35:43.300 --> 35:44.932
she starts swinging them at me.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.599
And she keeps coming.

35:47.601 --> 35:49.665
She tripped.

35:49.667 --> 35:52.367
I end up on the deck
with her on top of me.

35:53.667 --> 35:55.300
I pushed her off.

35:56.534 --> 35:59.300
Your knife punctured her heart.

36:02.834 --> 36:05.198
So, what did Harry do?

36:05.200 --> 36:07.200
He started freaking out.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.732
He's hammering the coke,

36:11.734 --> 36:13.899
and he says he's gonna
call someone who's gonna help.

36:13.901 --> 36:15.732
Who?

36:15.734 --> 36:18.832
The guy who got him
into the porn.

36:18.834 --> 36:20.832
So he goes in the other room,
and he makes the call.

36:20.834 --> 36:22.932
I can't hear
what they're saying.

36:22.934 --> 36:23.998
And when he comes back in,

36:24.000 --> 36:25.699
he tells me he's got help
to move the body

36:25.701 --> 36:27.100
and that I ought to
get out of there.

36:28.467 --> 36:30.966
I grabbed up the bag,
and I left.

36:30.968 --> 36:33.699
Who did he get help
with the body?

36:33.701 --> 36:35.966
I told you... I don't know.

36:35.968 --> 36:37.000
You're lying.

36:38.534 --> 36:40.267
Do you know how I know
you're lying?

36:42.100 --> 36:44.165
This is Harry's call log.

36:44.167 --> 36:46.832
He made calls to this number,
a disposable phone,

36:46.834 --> 36:48.998
including several last night.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.398
And this is your log.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.866
You made a call
to the same disposable phone

36:53.868 --> 36:55.432
at 8:03 this morning.

36:55.434 --> 36:57.565
This phone
has since been disconnected.

36:57.567 --> 36:59.100
Who did you call?

37:02.734 --> 37:04.866
We're looking at two murders.

37:04.868 --> 37:07.334
Ginny <i>and</i> Harry's.

37:09.634 --> 37:10.634
Alex something.

37:12.167 --> 37:13.665
I never saw him.

37:13.667 --> 37:15.198
He's the guy
who owned the place.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.832
He's also the guy
Harry called.

37:17.834 --> 37:20.398
And the guy Harry owed.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.300
And I'm pretty sure he's the guy
who helped get rid of the body.

37:24.834 --> 37:28.868
The camera was still running
after Ginny died, wasn't it?

37:30.601 --> 37:33.165
And it was still running
when Alex Bakuri

37:33.167 --> 37:35.098
and Harry came back
from dumping the body.

37:35.100 --> 37:37.567
I don't know what you mean.

37:38.801 --> 37:41.365
We reckon you got keys
to Harry's place.

37:41.367 --> 37:44.667
We also reckon you went back
to remove that recording.

37:47.234 --> 37:49.298
That's why you called Alex
this morning.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.167
Money in exchange
for that recording.

37:52.501 --> 37:54.501
Of Alex shooting Harry.

37:57.067 --> 37:59.031
Our thinking is,

37:59.033 --> 38:01.432
Alex shot Harry in the head

38:01.434 --> 38:04.098
because he didn't trust him
to keep his mouth shut.

38:04.100 --> 38:07.665
Do you really think
he's gonna let you live?

38:07.667 --> 38:09.534
Where can we find
that recording?

38:48.968 --> 38:51.532
She couldn't take
being threatened again.

38:51.534 --> 38:53.532
Another man with a knife,
just like her husband.

38:53.534 --> 38:54.968
That's why she's dead.

38:56.567 --> 38:57.868
Roll it on.

39:23.167 --> 39:25.098
Doesn't prove I killed him.

39:25.100 --> 39:28.167
The gunshot residue we found
on your jacket will, though.

39:38.067 --> 39:40.131
So just got to get those videos
taken down

39:40.133 --> 39:41.899
and the website prosecuted.

39:41.901 --> 39:43.499
But how likely is that?

39:43.501 --> 39:47.365
We got justice for Ginny,
two bad guys off the street.

39:47.367 --> 39:49.198
You sure you don't want to
come for a drink?

39:49.200 --> 39:51.100
No, I just want to get home.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.998
Evening, Sarge.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.465
See you tomorrow.
Thanks for today.

39:56.467 --> 39:58.734
Yeah, see ya.

40:00.534 --> 40:01.899
Did you talk to her?

40:01.901 --> 40:04.701
Yeah. All sorted.

40:07.067 --> 40:09.065
I'm gonna go and see if the boss
fancies a drink.

40:09.067 --> 40:11.701
Think he might need one.

40:31.534 --> 40:34.699
Yeah, this is Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole.

40:34.701 --> 40:39.165
Um, I've got the flyer for the
possible witness in the misper.

40:39.167 --> 40:40.899
Yeah, I've been told you were
looking into getting

40:40.901 --> 40:43.033
a more identifiable image.

40:44.868 --> 40:46.966
Yeah, that's great.

40:46.968 --> 40:48.300
Okay, cheers. Thanks.

41:07.868 --> 41:09.966
You all right?

41:09.968 --> 41:11.565
Nice place.

41:11.567 --> 41:14.200
Tidier than I expected.

41:14.968 --> 41:17.799
We need to talk.

41:17.801 --> 41:21.067
The boss' wife is missing,
and that's you with her bag.

41:23.067 --> 41:24.868
Yeah, I...

41:26.100 --> 41:29.866
I found it in a park
dumped on top of a bin. I...

41:29.868 --> 41:31.899
God, I should have
handed it in.

41:31.901 --> 41:33.265
You're gonna need to
tell the team

41:33.267 --> 41:36.434
when you found it and where,
or I will.

41:38.467 --> 41:41.565
Sure, sure, I'll tell them,
obviously.

41:41.567 --> 41:42.567
If that's what you think.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.701
Maybe I'll also tell them
about you and me.

41:49.467 --> 41:51.634
There is no you and me,
right?

41:57.901 --> 41:59.465
Look, if the situation
were any different.

41:59.467 --> 42:02.067
Yeah, I get it.
I get it.

42:04.367 --> 42:06.067
I'm sorry.

42:08.067 --> 42:10.432
I... I understand.

42:10.434 --> 42:13.398
I do 'cause it's your job,
and, uh...

42:13.400 --> 42:16.434
I just liked
that we were mates.

42:18.634 --> 42:20.400
I did too.

42:22.734 --> 42:25.234
Oh, how about
one last drink, then?

42:51.834 --> 42:54.734
This is Amber Saunders
with your wife's bag.

42:57.167 --> 42:58.899
Who's Amber Saunders?

42:58.901 --> 43:01.432
She's the witness that found
Tom Pryce's body

43:01.434 --> 43:03.599
hanging from the tree.

43:03.601 --> 43:04.934
She didn't say
that she knew him.

43:07.567 --> 43:09.133
Why does she have Sarah's bag?

43:10.801 --> 43:12.432
Did she know her too?

43:12.434 --> 43:14.098
I hope not.

43:14.100 --> 43:15.198
Why?

43:15.200 --> 43:16.932
You know I've always thought

43:16.934 --> 43:18.801
there were two people
involved in that murder.

43:20.133 --> 43:22.499
I think Amber's one of them.

43:24.167 --> 43:26.298
I'm sorry, Amber.
I'm tired.
