where are you?.
Show yourself!.

11:43.469 --> 11:46.336
Face it. No one
would sexually harass you.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.339
You don't have the goods.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.636
well, you do,
but they went bad long ago.

11:50.743 --> 11:55.373
No need to respond. I'll laugh myself out.
[ Laughs ]

11:56.482 --> 11:59.076
I am harassable!
I'll show you.

11:59.185 --> 12:03.417
There's gotta be someone in that office
who's man enough to offend a lady like me.

12:05.524 --> 12:09.392
Name's Luke Fondleburg.
Just started today.

12:09.495 --> 12:13.625
Any hot pieces of tail around this office
that like a good groping?.

12:15.634 --> 12:18.797
You see that episode of Seinfeld
Thursday night 1 0 years ago?.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.307
[ Burbles ]

12:22.408 --> 12:27.607
My kids are out of control.
All because of Stan and his crazy legacy.

12:27.713 --> 12:31.240
And the living room is
a hole with a donkey in it!

12:31.350 --> 12:33.818
Dad is nuts.
There is no gold.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.888
But I don't care, as long as he doesn't
hassle me about my piercings.

12:36.989 --> 12:41.187
- Did your father hassle you about stuff?.
- [Terry Sobs]

12:41.293 --> 12:44.160
what's the matter, Terry?.
why are you crying?.

12:44.263 --> 12:48.632
I say let him dig. Just so long as
he doesn't get between me and my lady.

12:48.734 --> 12:53.137
She and I are doing great too.
Last night I got a dusty pinky.

12:53.239 --> 12:57.403
Family doesn't support me.
That's okay. I know it's here.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.377
If I eat all the dirt,
all that will be left is the gold.

13:00.479 --> 13:04.472
Oh, my God.
He's gone totally insane.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.677
we've gotta have an intervention
and stop this madness.

13:24.001 --> 13:28.199
- You actually found Oliver North's gold.
- Look. He left a note.

13:28.305 --> 13:30.535
""Congratulations.
You deciphered my riddle...

13:30.641 --> 13:32.541
""about the good, the bad
and the ugly...

13:32.643 --> 13:35.976
followed the Ice Creamsicle wrappers
and found my gold"!

13:36.080 --> 13:41.074
we are a lock for an Oscar if
there isn't a documentary about
penguins or genocide this year.

13:41.185 --> 13:44.484
- Or penguin genocide. Oh!
- Oh, I know.

13:44.588 --> 13:48.080
where were you two?. You missed
the big moment when I dug up the gold!

13:48.192 --> 13:50.217
My Smithsonian exhibit
will need that footage.

13:50.327 --> 13:52.227
Come down into the pit,
and we'll stage it.

13:52.329 --> 13:55.093
It's not ethical for a journalist
to stage events.

13:55.199 --> 13:58.327
Fine. I'll film it myself.
I don't need you two.

13:58.435 --> 14:00.995
And I don't need a family
who never believed in me.

14:01.105 --> 14:04.973
I tell you. It makes me want to do a whole
bunch of stuff you said I'd never do-

14:05.075 --> 14:08.909
like starting my own dance studio,
or killing pigeons with my mind.

14:10.514 --> 14:14.280
Just for your information,
I believed in the dance studio.

14:14.385 --> 14:17.718
But two days before we opened-
it wasn't your father's fault-

14:17.821 --> 14:20.051
a woman got raped
in the locker room.

14:30.968 --> 14:34.904
Hmm! what's this I'm seeing
for the first time?.

14:37.274 --> 14:39.242
Ollie North's gold?.

14:39.343 --> 14:41.937
Here's looking at you, gold.

14:42.045 --> 14:44.013
""Here's looking at you, gold"?.
what is that?.

14:44.114 --> 14:46.082
Come on, Stan. You can do better.
It's for your legacy, man.

14:50.235 --> 14:52.260
Aay, you.

14:52.371 --> 14:55.340
Get it?. ""A.U."
That's the chemical symbol for gold.

14:57.610 --> 15:00.477
Me Chinese. Me make joke.
Me find gold, gold in your Coke.

15:00.579 --> 15:05.016
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-l... d!

15:06.619 --> 15:09.713
Have I unearthed Oliver North's gold,
or has it...

15:09.822 --> 15:11.949
unearthed me?.

15:12.057 --> 15:14.423
That's it.
A perfect historical quote.

15:14.526 --> 15:16.790
Brief, dignified, unclear.

15:16.895 --> 15:18.920
- [Rumbling]
- Is that dirt or donkey?.

15:25.638 --> 15:28.937
And filthy rich
in three, two-

[ wailing ]
Manager guy!

15:32.044 --> 15:34.774
Luke sexually harassed me.
It was horrible.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.007
He wouldn't stop.
I deserve money.

15:37.116 --> 15:39.516
well, this is very serious, Laura.

15:39.618 --> 15:43.076
- [ Beeps ]
- Marjorie, could you please
send in Luke Fondleburg?.

15:43.188 --> 15:45.679
Oops. Just got my period.
Damn uterus...

15:45.791 --> 15:48.555
refreshing itself every month
like it owns the joint.

15:50.195 --> 15:52.129
- You wanted to see me?.
- Fondleburg...

15:52.231 --> 15:54.995
did you sexually harass
Miss Vanderbooben?.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.967
You bet your ass I did.
I harassed the crap out of her.

15:58.070 --> 16:00.595
Damn it!
Now we have to pay her a settlement.

16:00.706 --> 16:02.970
- You're fired!
- Both of those things work for me.

16:03.075 --> 16:04.975
See you in hell.

16:05.077 --> 16:08.012
False alarm. It turns out I just had to poop.
what did Luke say?.

16:08.113 --> 16:10.138
well, he admitted he harassed you.

16:10.249 --> 16:13.548
I'm still reeling. Let's talk settlement.
I'm thinking a million dollars.

16:13.652 --> 16:15.847
Actually, our lawyers
have determined that juries pay...

16:15.954 --> 16:19.253
a larger settlement to women
who are more attractive.

16:19.358 --> 16:22.725
So, with that in mind,
this is our offer.

16:26.331 --> 16:28.231
Unharassable, huh?.

16:28.333 --> 16:30.733
well, this juicy settlement
says otherwise.

16:32.004 --> 16:34.837
wow. $90,000.

16:34.940 --> 16:36.840
I know.
Respectable, right?.

16:36.942 --> 16:38.933
Ja, ja. Completely respectable.

16:39.044 --> 16:42.775
[ Chuckles ]
wow. That's a lot of money.

16:42.881 --> 16:46.282
So, uh, can you, um- I don't know-
loan me a couple of g's?.

16:46.385 --> 16:48.353
Oh, no. No. I'm sorry.
I have a policy.

16:48.454 --> 16:51.981
- I never loan friends money.
- Oh. Okay.

16:52.091 --> 16:54.582
- But I'm good for it.
- No. I know. It's not about that.

16:54.693 --> 16:57.719
It's just a rule I have.
I got in a situation a few years ago.

16:57.830 --> 16:59.730
It got really ugly.
So I...

16:59.832 --> 17:02.357
-just decided-
- Okay.

17:02.468 --> 17:05.904
- I'm sorry I asked.
- I am too.

- Yeah. I think so.
- Oh, thank God he's all right.

17:24.256 --> 17:26.884
Look. It's the Langley Falls
town geologist.

17:30.362 --> 17:32.592
It's true what they say
about geologists.

17:32.698 --> 17:35.292
They're the coolest,
sexiest men alive.

17:36.568 --> 17:38.661
The rest of this pit
will collapse any moment.

17:38.771 --> 17:42.571
we have to get that man out of there
immediately or he'll be buried alive.

17:42.674 --> 17:45.666
we fill that hole with foam,
your man will float right to the top.

17:45.778 --> 17:47.336
I don't think that would work.

17:47.446 --> 17:50.210
Neither do I, but I got a truck
full of foam and six kids to feed.

17:50.315 --> 17:52.715
- Come on. I need this.
- why don't we just lower a rope?.

17:52.818 --> 17:56.879
- A rope made of foam?.
- Stop, okay?. Just stop.

with a message for the Smithsonian.

You probably know me from the movie they made
about my life, starring Bruce Campbell.

out of those crappy ""B" movies...

- I don't know.

everyone to the waffle House.

- Sorry you lost your legacy, Dad.

well, that sure is a nice lesson.

20:24.903 --> 20:27.531
You know, they say
I teach these kids...

they're the ones who teach me.

20:30.943 --> 20:34.174
what?. You're not a teacher.
You're a fireman.
