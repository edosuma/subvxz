WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:06.750
My name is Bridget.

00:06.790 --> 00:08.340
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.380 --> 00:11.260
Just get up on the stand and
tell the judge what you saw.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.170
We'll protect you.
<b></b>
You don't get it.

00:13.220 --> 00:15.930
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.970 --> 00:19.180
I ran to my sister
Siobhan for help.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.140
Siobhan? Siobhan!

00:21.180 --> 00:24.230
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:24.270 --> 00:25.440
It was so easy.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.480
I saw a way out, and I took it.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.270
They all think that I'm her.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.900
Her husband.

00:30.940 --> 00:32.190
Her lover.
<b></b>
Make a choice--

00:32.240 --> 00:33.190
him or me.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.400
Her best friend.

00:34.450 --> 00:36.110
I think Henry's
having an affair.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.240
I believe Siobhan Martin
is harboring a fugitive,

00:38.280 --> 00:39.370
and the more I find out
about her,

00:39.410 --> 00:41.620
the closer I get to Bridget.

00:41.660 --> 00:43.830
MAN [over phone]:
Siobhan, we have a problem.

00:43.870 --> 00:44.910
Bridget's still alive.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.070
[footfalls]

01:11.110 --> 01:12.070
You're here.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.820
Um, have you given
any thought to dinner?

01:17.860 --> 01:19.030
I was thinking about
that Chinese place.

01:19.070 --> 01:20.620
You know, the one
around the corner.

01:20.660 --> 01:24.700
Siobhan hates that Chinese place
on the corner, Bridget.

01:27.330 --> 01:28.670
What did you just say?

01:28.710 --> 01:29.670
Bridget Kelly.

01:31.960 --> 01:32.920
That's your name, isn't it?

01:35.470 --> 01:37.300
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:40.010 --> 01:43.010
They found your bag
at the bus station.

01:44.310 --> 01:45.770
They thought it
belonged to Siobhan.

01:48.230 --> 01:50.810
It was full of clothes
that she would never wear.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.520
It didn't make sense.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.110
But then I found
this driver's license...

01:56.690 --> 02:00.780
with Siobhan's picture
and Bridget Kelly's name.

02:03.410 --> 02:04.490
It's not what you think.

02:04.540 --> 02:05.790
What have you done with Siobhan?

02:05.830 --> 02:08.290
I didn't do anything.

02:08.330 --> 02:10.790
We...we were on the boat,
and she died.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.380
You let her drown.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.090
I didn't. I swear.
I--I wanted to save her.

02:14.130 --> 02:15.090
I tried.

02:15.130 --> 02:17.720
You've lied to us all.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.640
Me, Henry, Gemma.

02:21.680 --> 02:22.800
Andrew, I'm so sorry.

02:24.850 --> 02:27.350
I never meant to hurt
any of you.

02:27.390 --> 02:28.480
Don't apologize
to me.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.980
Apologize to her.

02:36.610 --> 02:37.570
[gasps]

02:41.280 --> 02:43.320
ANDREW:
Shiv?

02:43.370 --> 02:44.330
You OK?

02:44.370 --> 02:45.330
Yeah.

02:48.870 --> 02:51.170
You haven't slept
well in weeks.

02:51.210 --> 02:51.790
This can't be good for the baby.

02:54.750 --> 02:57.210
You know, maybe I should just
get out of the city.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.840
That might be good for me.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.470
I could go to the Hamptons.

03:00.510 --> 03:01.590
By yourself?

03:01.630 --> 03:02.970
Just for the weekend.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.560
You know, um, I could use
some time on my own.

03:08.270 --> 03:09.600
You want to be alone
on your birthday?

03:10.640 --> 03:13.100
[sighs]

03:13.150 --> 03:14.610
Oh, my God, I...

03:14.650 --> 03:18.400
Everything going on, I...
I lost all track of time.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.530
You, forget your birthday?

03:20.570 --> 03:23.200
[sighs]
Look...

03:23.240 --> 03:25.660
I know you're upset
about what happened last year,

03:25.700 --> 03:29.450
but I had hoped you'd give me
a chance to make it up to you.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.670
I thought we were supposed
to be making a fresh start.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.290
No, I--I want that, too.

03:34.330 --> 03:37.550
I...I like how things
have been between us lately.

03:37.590 --> 03:39.210
Well, if you
want to get away

03:39.260 --> 03:42.180
to the Hamptons, let's go.

03:42.220 --> 03:45.800
We can celebrate your birthday
on the beach like we used to.

03:45.850 --> 03:46.930
I'd like that.

03:48.720 --> 03:51.270
I'm sure I could
finish up work early.

03:51.310 --> 03:53.310
We could drive out
this afternoon.

03:53.350 --> 03:54.690
There's no reason
for you to rush.

03:54.730 --> 03:57.820
I...I'll just take
the jitney this morning.

03:57.860 --> 03:59.030
The jitney?

03:59.070 --> 04:00.030
Yeah.

04:05.530 --> 04:07.160
[chuckling]

04:07.200 --> 04:08.370
Really, Shiv?

04:08.410 --> 04:09.620
I mean, whatever next?

04:09.660 --> 04:11.450
A newfound appreciation
for the subway?

04:11.500 --> 04:12.790
[laughs]

04:12.830 --> 04:14.830
Just trying to keep you
on your toes.

04:14.870 --> 04:17.540
I'll send the car service
for you.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.880
In fact, I'll take care
of all the planning.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.130
We'll do the usual, huh?

04:21.170 --> 04:23.550
Yeah.

04:23.590 --> 04:25.090
You know, I've really missed
these weekends.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.930
[door opens, closes]

04:31.980 --> 04:33.270
[horns honking]

05:04.220 --> 05:05.680
MACHADO:
Yeah, he's the one
who came over.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.680
We have cameras all over.
Hold on a second.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.470
Let me call you back.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.600
When did this come in?

05:10.640 --> 05:12.680
Hamptons PD
just e-mailed it over.

05:12.720 --> 05:13.980
Smart move
putting the duffel bag

05:14.020 --> 05:15.640
back where
you found it.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.060
Looks like she's still
in New York.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.350
Only way she could know
about that bag

05:18.400 --> 05:21.020
is if her sister told her.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.400
Siobhan knows
where her sister is.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.570
We're going to find
Bridget Kelly.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.850
Hey, Malcolm, it's me.

05:52.890 --> 05:54.430
Uh, sorry to keep calling you.

05:54.470 --> 05:56.980
Just haven't heard from you.

05:57.020 --> 05:59.100
I hope you're not mad at me.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.690
I know you don't want me
staying here,

06:00.730 --> 06:03.150
but I'm doing OK.

06:03.190 --> 06:05.230
Really.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.950
I just hope everything's
OK with you.

06:08.990 --> 06:10.240
Will you call me, please?

06:12.080 --> 06:13.030
I miss you.

06:30.010 --> 06:31.090
ANDREW:
Siobhan?

06:39.560 --> 06:40.600
You're here early.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.310
I pawned off my work
on Olivia.

06:43.360 --> 06:47.530
Who wants to be in the city
when you can be on the beach?

06:47.570 --> 06:50.030
[sighs] Water's
so calm today.

06:50.070 --> 06:52.030
Can't wait to get the boat
out there.

06:52.070 --> 06:53.030
I'll pass on that.

06:56.370 --> 07:00.460
It just...the thought
of it makes me nauseous.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.920
Of course--the baby.

07:02.960 --> 07:03.920
[cell phone chirps]

07:05.590 --> 07:06.590
Work?

07:06.630 --> 07:07.760
It's just
one text, Shiv.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.430
I promise,
what happened last year

07:14.470 --> 07:15.850
is not going to happen again.

07:15.890 --> 07:17.970
I should never have left you
at dinner,

07:18.020 --> 07:20.020
no matter what
was going on at the office.

07:20.060 --> 07:22.020
We were in
such a bad place.

07:22.060 --> 07:26.190
I had no idea
if you even wanted me around.

07:26.230 --> 07:28.150
I...

07:28.190 --> 07:29.150
Look.

07:29.190 --> 07:31.030
[beeping]

07:31.070 --> 07:32.820
I am done with work
for the weekend.

07:32.860 --> 07:34.990
This year,

07:35.030 --> 07:39.870
I'm going to make your birthday
the best birthday ever.

07:39.910 --> 07:44.040
It's been a long time
since anyone's done that for me.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.590
BRIDGET: OK, what you're
talking about is not football.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.000
It's soccer, OK?

07:47.040 --> 07:49.380
And you have to admit
it's kind of boring.

07:49.420 --> 07:50.630
So you're telling me
all those games

07:50.670 --> 07:53.130
you sat through
cheering and screaming,

07:53.180 --> 07:54.550
you were faking that?

07:54.590 --> 07:56.050
Getting worried.
What else were you faking?

07:56.100 --> 07:57.640
[glass shattering]

07:57.680 --> 07:58.760
[angry voices in distance]

08:01.930 --> 08:02.890
Stay here.

08:09.820 --> 08:11.570
[voices growing louder]

08:14.570 --> 08:16.570
I thought you guys were calling
when you got close.

08:16.620 --> 08:18.370
Sorry. We...we didn't
hear you come in.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.410
We were just having
a discussion,

08:20.450 --> 08:21.750
and then he
wasn't looking,

08:21.790 --> 08:22.750
and the vase broke.

08:22.790 --> 08:23.920
No, you threw it at me.

08:26.000 --> 08:26.960
Is everything OK?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.090
It's fine.

08:28.130 --> 08:29.300
It's just
a misunderstanding.

08:29.340 --> 08:31.670
We'll pay
for the vase.

08:31.710 --> 08:33.970
Anyway...
happy birthday.

08:34.010 --> 08:35.300
Thank you. I...

08:35.340 --> 08:36.970
I didn't realize
you guys were coming.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.260
Andrew said we were
doing the Siobhan

08:38.300 --> 08:40.010
birthday getaway,
like old times.

08:40.060 --> 08:41.020
Assumed you were
expecting us.

08:41.060 --> 08:42.520
We were.

08:42.560 --> 08:45.390
Didn't think you'd be
letting yourselves in.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.900
We can leave.
We should leave.

08:46.940 --> 08:49.320
I was really looking
forward to a weekend away.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.150
No work, no kids.

08:51.190 --> 08:53.400
Look, if you guys want
to stay, we'd love

08:53.440 --> 08:54.700
to have you,
wouldn't we?

08:55.910 --> 08:57.160
Please, stay.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.570
It'll...it'll be
a great weekend.

09:01.580 --> 09:03.910
I, um... [clears throat]

09:03.960 --> 09:04.910
I'll go get the bags.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.250
Sorry.
<b></b>
Ah, think nothing of it.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.550
MACHADO:
Bridget Kelly
fled from police

09:13.590 --> 09:15.470
in Wyoming on
September 6,

09:15.510 --> 09:18.010
the night before she was
scheduled to testify.

09:18.050 --> 09:19.140
Now, thanks
to the bag

09:19.180 --> 09:20.600
you recovered
at the bus station,

09:20.640 --> 09:21.890
we know that
Kelly was here

09:21.930 --> 09:24.430
in the Hamptons
on or before September 9.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.430
Then she disappeared.

09:27.350 --> 09:28.810
Siobhan sent Bridget
that letter

09:28.850 --> 09:30.360
long before Bridget
was on the run.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.280
And the woman can talk
her way out of anything,

09:32.320 --> 09:33.690
so confronting her about the bag

09:33.730 --> 09:35.650
will more likely than not
get me nowhere.

09:35.700 --> 09:39.030
Unless I have hard evidence--
something that proves

09:39.070 --> 09:40.660
that Martin and Kelly
have been in contact.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.660
If I can find that,

09:41.700 --> 09:42.830
then I have
probable cause

09:42.870 --> 09:44.620
for search warrants
and phone taps.

09:44.660 --> 09:45.750
And hell,
I can even charge Siobhan

09:45.790 --> 09:47.290
with obstruction of justice.

09:47.330 --> 09:50.330
Oh. Those eyes you asked me
to put on Siobhan Martin--

09:50.380 --> 09:52.420
came up with an unidentified car
at the Martin house.

09:52.460 --> 09:53.500
We ran the plates.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.720
Henry and Gemma Butler.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.840
That's very interesting.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.850
Why is that?

10:00.890 --> 10:02.640
Takes a brave woman
to share a house

10:02.680 --> 10:03.760
with her husband
and her lover.

10:06.270 --> 10:08.770
What was that back there?

10:08.810 --> 10:11.520
When Andrew called,
I was so excited.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.690
And then Henry and I
fought all the way here.

10:13.730 --> 10:16.740
By the time we arrived,
I was so fed up, I lost it.

10:16.780 --> 10:21.120
I'm trying to believe him when
he says he's not cheating.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.540
Every bone in my body tells
me he's up to something.

10:26.330 --> 10:28.580
I thought coming out here
would be good for us.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.370
We used to love
the Hamptons.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.590
Now we can't even make it
through a two-hour car ride.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.210
If you love him,
you have to fight for him.

10:40.050 --> 10:43.350
You'd tell me if there
was anything I could do, right?

10:43.390 --> 10:44.810
Thanks.

10:44.850 --> 10:46.560
God, I'm sick of hearing me talk
about this.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.930
I am going
to check out

10:47.980 --> 10:49.890
that adorable, little
store around the corner,

10:49.940 --> 10:51.310
pick up something
for the twins.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.650
OK. Think I'm going
to finish up,

10:52.690 --> 10:53.900
and see you back
at the house.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.400
I want you to know how
much it means to me

10:58.440 --> 11:01.450
that I can talk to you
about all this stuff.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.740
You're an
amazing friend.

11:03.780 --> 11:04.990
Like a sister.

11:13.290 --> 11:14.670
YOUNG SIOBHAN:
Hey, Bridget, over here!

11:16.750 --> 11:19.420
Oh, Siobhan,
it's beautiful.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.050
One day I'm gonna have
one of those.

11:22.090 --> 11:23.970
We should buy something
for our birthday.

11:24.010 --> 11:25.260
Mom gave us money.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.010
20 bucks?

11:27.060 --> 11:29.390
We'll find something.
Like...

11:32.190 --> 11:35.270
those! They're pretty
and cheap.

11:35.310 --> 11:36.650
Not cheap enough.

11:36.690 --> 11:38.230
But it's our birthday.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.150
I know. We're supposed
to have tons of presents

11:40.190 --> 11:41.950
and a crazy party.

11:41.990 --> 11:43.910
I hate being poor.

11:43.950 --> 11:47.490
When I get older, I'm going
to have everything I want.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.870
I just really want that.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.670
We could always
buy one and share.

11:52.710 --> 11:54.170
I don't want to share.

11:54.210 --> 11:55.710
We won't know
whose turn it is.

11:55.750 --> 11:56.880
We'll make it simple.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.380
It'll be your turn
for a year.

11:58.420 --> 12:01.050
And then on our next birthday,
it'll be my turn.

12:01.090 --> 12:03.180
And then yours.

12:03.220 --> 12:04.640
Like, forever?

12:04.680 --> 12:05.720
That's kinda cool.

12:13.730 --> 12:15.520
Gemma Butler?

12:15.560 --> 12:16.980
Can I help you?

12:17.020 --> 12:17.980
I hope so.

12:20.190 --> 12:22.280
I have a few questions.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.740
About Siobhan Martin?

12:25.780 --> 12:28.660
No, About Bridget Kelly.

12:28.700 --> 12:29.990
Siobhan Martin's twin sister.

12:42.050 --> 12:43.130
You were gone a while.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.430
The boys went golfing.

12:46.470 --> 12:49.760
And I found a backlog of
six months of trash magazines.

12:49.810 --> 12:50.850
Did you know
that Angelina Jolie used

12:50.890 --> 12:51.890
to let her kids eat crickets?

12:54.190 --> 12:57.610
Why didn't you tell me
about Bridget?

12:57.650 --> 12:58.860
What?

12:58.900 --> 13:00.230
Your twin?

13:00.270 --> 13:03.440
An FBI agent
just told me about her,

13:03.490 --> 13:06.820
how she's on the run
from the police.

13:06.860 --> 13:08.240
You spoke to the FBI?

13:08.280 --> 13:10.740
Agent Machado?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.120
What did you tell him?

13:12.160 --> 13:14.910
Nothing because I don't know
anything.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.670
I've known you for five years,
Shiv.

13:17.710 --> 13:20.710
I had no idea
you had a sister. A twin?

13:20.750 --> 13:21.800
How do you keep that hidden?

13:29.220 --> 13:32.890
We're not a part
of each other's lives.

13:32.930 --> 13:35.350
My sister...

13:35.390 --> 13:37.650
did something unforgivable.

13:37.690 --> 13:38.650
What?

13:41.150 --> 13:42.530
She ruined her life.

13:42.570 --> 13:48.240
Just...one bad choice
after another,

13:48.280 --> 13:50.070
till I didn't even
recognize her anymore.

13:52.660 --> 13:54.540
I'm ashamed of what she did.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.040
Do you have any idea
where she is?

14:05.300 --> 14:06.300
No.

14:08.550 --> 14:11.470
I should have been able
to help her...save her.

14:13.810 --> 14:17.390
Just when I thought
I had her back,

14:17.430 --> 14:18.730
she was gone.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.020
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

14:24.150 --> 14:26.240
I haven't told Andrew.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.240
Really? Why?

14:28.280 --> 14:30.450
I met Andrew after the fallout.

14:30.490 --> 14:33.740
I didn't know how
to bring it up.

14:33.780 --> 14:35.450
I mean, I know I need
to tell him,

14:35.490 --> 14:38.290
I just...I'm not ready.

14:38.330 --> 14:41.040
Well, he won't hear it from me.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.300
God, Siobhan, all these years,
I never would have guessed.

14:44.340 --> 14:47.510
You're always so excited
about your birthday.

14:47.550 --> 14:48.840
It must have been
eating you up

14:48.880 --> 14:50.550
not being able to share it
with your sister.

14:53.510 --> 14:54.760
It was our special day.

14:57.890 --> 14:59.140
I miss her.

14:59.180 --> 15:00.310
[knocking]

15:05.440 --> 15:07.230
I thought I was clear.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.360
I don't want to see you.

15:10.030 --> 15:10.990
It's our birthday.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.780
Red velvet--
your favorite.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.680
You're moving?

15:32.720 --> 15:36.310
Yeah...to New York.

15:36.350 --> 15:38.350
I met someone.

15:38.390 --> 15:40.060
Siobhan, you can't
just run away.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.810
Don't you dare
lecture me on what

15:41.850 --> 15:43.150
I can and can't do.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.400
Andrew loves me.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.440
I can start over.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.080
I never want it back.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.650
[sighs]

16:31.990 --> 16:33.950
[indistinct chatter]

16:55.880 --> 16:56.840
Bonjour.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.180
Excuse me.

17:04.850 --> 17:06.230
Tyler, I've been trying
to reach you.

17:08.270 --> 17:09.900
I was busy with work.

17:09.940 --> 17:11.730
You're not working
right now.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.780
May I borrow you
just for a minute?

17:13.820 --> 17:14.820
[sighs]
Sure.

17:21.950 --> 17:23.660
I'm really sorry
about how

17:23.700 --> 17:24.830
things ended
the other night.

17:24.870 --> 17:26.420
I was really sick.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.250
Yeah, it's no big deal.

17:28.290 --> 17:29.790
Besides,
I met Simone.

17:29.840 --> 17:30.920
She doesn't speak
a lot of English,

17:30.960 --> 17:32.550
but then again,

17:32.590 --> 17:34.420
she doesn't have to.

17:34.470 --> 17:38.340
Tyler, I like
you...a lot.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.010
We had a connection.

17:40.050 --> 17:42.140
Is that how you connect
with people--

17:42.180 --> 17:44.310
shove them out of your hotel
room without a second thought?

17:48.900 --> 17:50.860
Look, I got to get back.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.230
It was, uh,
great meeting you.

17:55.610 --> 17:56.610
Have a lovely stay
in Paris.

18:00.030 --> 18:02.910
[phone rings]

18:02.950 --> 18:04.040
[sighs]
Hello?

18:06.620 --> 18:07.620
I hit a snag.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.520
HENRY:
Look who's here.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.020
It's just like old times.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.820
All day, all I could think
about was this moment--

18:37.860 --> 18:39.110
wondering if you were going
to show up,

18:39.150 --> 18:40.910
whether...if we were going
to sneak off

18:40.950 --> 18:43.200
or just, you know,
do it right here.

18:43.240 --> 18:46.790
What the hell
are you doing?

18:46.830 --> 18:51.960
How many times do I have
to tell you it's over?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.250
Are you kidding me?
I was ready to leave.

18:54.290 --> 18:55.590
You were the one
that asked me to stay.

18:55.630 --> 18:58.800
With your wife, to
celebrate my birthday.

18:58.840 --> 19:00.090
This is how
we celebrate.

19:00.130 --> 19:01.470
This is our place.

19:01.510 --> 19:03.050
With them
sleeping upstairs?

19:04.600 --> 19:07.390
What is wrong with you?

19:07.430 --> 19:10.770
It's like you've forgotten
the last year existed.

19:10.810 --> 19:12.730
Don't you remember
how happy we used to be?

19:25.580 --> 19:28.370
WOMAN: ♪ I can feel
when the wind blows ♪

19:28.410 --> 19:32.920
♪ See the storm clouds
gather round my window... ♪

19:32.960 --> 19:35.670
I'm so happy
you changed your mind.

19:35.710 --> 19:37.880
I always wanted
to be here with you.

19:37.920 --> 19:41.680
I just had to keep up
appearances, or so I thought.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.720
I take it you didn't have
trouble getting away?

19:43.760 --> 19:44.800
Uh-uh.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.850
Emergency work meeting.

19:46.890 --> 19:49.640
Olivia actually showed
up at the restaurant.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.020
You should have seen
the look in her eyes

19:51.060 --> 19:52.310
when he left me there

19:52.350 --> 19:53.440
all alone.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.190
Wow.

19:55.230 --> 19:56.900
So happy birthday to you.

19:56.940 --> 19:58.440
Happy birthday to me.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.610
[moans]

20:00.650 --> 20:02.490
Hurry up and
finish your book.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.620
I don't want to be apart
from you another day.

20:04.660 --> 20:07.410
I'm trying;
work is going slow.

20:07.450 --> 20:09.950
The muses
are not cooperating.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.250
Excuse me, I thought
I was your muse.

20:12.290 --> 20:13.580
You are my muse.

20:13.620 --> 20:15.580
[moans]

20:15.630 --> 20:16.710
Did you bring
it with you?

20:16.750 --> 20:17.790
I want you
to read to me.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.000
Uh-uh,
it's terrible.

20:19.050 --> 20:21.170
No, it's brilliant.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.050
Come on, it's
my birthday.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.680
All right, I'll read it.

20:29.510 --> 20:31.310
Hey, what's this?

20:31.350 --> 20:32.850
Oh, I went

20:32.890 --> 20:34.690
and picked up the mail.
I was hoping it was a present.

20:34.730 --> 20:36.230
There's no return address on it.

20:38.650 --> 20:39.690
I'm not picky.

20:39.730 --> 20:40.820
I'll take presents from anyone.

20:56.830 --> 20:58.750
Not exactly
your style.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.840
Who's it from?

21:00.880 --> 21:03.630
An old friend.

21:03.670 --> 21:06.720
We used to pass it
back and forth on our birthdays.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.100
Hmm, that sounds sweet.

21:08.140 --> 21:09.100
Why'd you stop?

21:13.560 --> 21:14.940
You really don't want to
talk about this, do you?

21:18.270 --> 21:19.690
I want you to read to me.

21:19.730 --> 21:20.900
[Henry groans, Siobhan chuckles]

21:20.940 --> 21:22.820
All right, but
it's a first draft,

21:22.860 --> 21:25.360
so please just be gentle.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.110
Never.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.160
OK.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.740
City Burns by Henry Butler.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.040
"The traffic

21:34.080 --> 21:37.120
"in the city was worse
than usual that day.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.170
"The smog rose
hot off the grates,

21:39.210 --> 21:40.710
"into the streets.

21:40.750 --> 21:43.800
The mist parted
as the door to the taxi opened."

21:45.800 --> 21:48.390
I haven't forgotten.

21:48.430 --> 21:49.680
I'm ashamed.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.140
And you know what?
You should be, too.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.680
I--I don't
want to hurt

21:53.720 --> 21:55.020
Andrew or Gemma.

21:55.060 --> 21:56.020
You don't give
a crap

21:56.060 --> 21:58.560
about Gemma or Andrew.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.230
Maybe I didn't,
but I do now.

22:02.270 --> 22:03.320
What about me?

22:06.190 --> 22:07.900
We were in love, Siobhan.

22:07.950 --> 22:09.450
We had plans.

22:09.490 --> 22:12.160
Somehow, overnight,
that all changed for you,

22:12.200 --> 22:14.540
but where the hell
does that leave me?

22:14.580 --> 22:16.460
I'm sorry.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.870
I really am.

22:17.910 --> 22:19.830
No, I don't want sorry.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.000
I want you.

23:28.820 --> 23:30.780
[people chattering quietly]

23:43.670 --> 23:46.250
Ms. Farrell.
Excusez-moi.

23:46.290 --> 23:47.460
I need to speak
with you.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.760
In my office,
s'il vous plaît.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.470
Now's not really a good time.

23:52.510 --> 23:54.180
It's important.

23:54.220 --> 23:57.560
Neither of us
wants to cause a scene.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.930
But if you wish to

23:58.970 --> 24:00.730
extend your stay here,
we must discuss payment

24:00.770 --> 24:01.770
immediately.

24:01.810 --> 24:03.150
My office is this way.

24:03.190 --> 24:04.560
Hey, there you are.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.270
If we leave now, we'll
just make the meeting.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.320
I'm sorry to
interrupt.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.820
Is everything OK?
<b></b>
Very nice to see you again,
Monsieur Barrett.

24:12.860 --> 24:14.660
I was unaware
that you knew Ms. Farrell.

24:14.700 --> 24:15.950
TYLER: She works
for my company.

24:15.990 --> 24:18.790
And we are about to
be late for the boss.

24:18.830 --> 24:21.120
You know how he gets.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.710
Please give
my very best regards.

24:22.750 --> 24:24.330
Will do.

24:24.370 --> 24:25.580
Sorry to delay you.

24:27.170 --> 24:28.920
Just please come see me
at your earliest convenience.

24:32.800 --> 24:33.760
Thank you.

24:35.680 --> 24:36.760
What's going on with you?

24:39.810 --> 24:41.480
Just having
a lousy week.

24:41.520 --> 24:42.520
[chuckles]

24:44.940 --> 24:48.270
I've always dreamed
of coming to Paris.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.940
I'd taken lessons
for years.

24:50.980 --> 24:53.650
This is my
first trip.

24:53.700 --> 24:57.820
My husband kept
promising to bring me.

24:57.870 --> 24:58.830
When I left him,

24:58.870 --> 25:00.870
I decided to
come on my own.

25:03.830 --> 25:04.790
Does he know you're here?

25:07.750 --> 25:10.710
Guess you could
say I ran away.

25:12.630 --> 25:13.970
I had a plan.

25:14.010 --> 25:15.840
I had money
to live on.

25:15.880 --> 25:19.300
But it's all just
falling apart.

25:19.350 --> 25:22.640
Somebody drained
my savings account.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.730
Can't afford my hotel.

25:24.770 --> 25:27.770
And I can't ask anyone
back home for help,

25:27.810 --> 25:32.230
because then he would know
I was here.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.690
You think your husband
took your money?

25:36.490 --> 25:38.450
I don't know.

25:38.490 --> 25:40.080
I can't even really
think about it.

25:40.120 --> 25:44.080
I just know I'm not ready
to go back.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.710
And the most pathetic
part of all:

25:47.750 --> 25:49.540
today is my birthday.

25:52.550 --> 25:55.130
Wait.
Let me get this straight.

25:55.170 --> 26:00.350
So you always wanted to come
to Paris, and now you're here,

26:00.390 --> 26:03.930
on your birthday, miserable?

26:03.970 --> 26:06.350
Pretty pathetic, huh?

26:06.390 --> 26:09.400
Well, that is,
that is not acceptable.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.440
Come on.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.570
We're going to go celebrate.

26:12.610 --> 26:13.980
What about the brunette?

26:14.030 --> 26:16.900
She's fun, but, uh...

26:16.950 --> 26:18.030
I've always had
a thing for blondes.

26:20.570 --> 26:21.740
SINGER:
Agent Machado.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.950
Found a citation
from the local marina.

26:23.990 --> 26:26.250
Somebody took the Martins'
boat out September 9,

26:26.290 --> 26:28.670
and then returned it
to the wrong slip.

26:28.710 --> 26:30.710
What's this have to do
with Bridget Kelly?

26:30.750 --> 26:31.840
The timing fits.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.460
We know Bridget
was here that day.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.590
I followed up by interviewing
everybody at the marina.

26:35.630 --> 26:37.380
Nobody saw Siobhan
or Bridget.

26:37.420 --> 26:38.840
So then I checked
local water cams,

26:38.880 --> 26:42.050
radio traffic, Coast Guard
activity for that day.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.430
That's when things
got interesting.

26:46.020 --> 26:47.350
Figured you'd want
to hear this for yourself.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.900
MAN [recording]:
Distress call, U.S. Coast...

26:55.440 --> 26:57.400
[static, muffled voices]

26:59.780 --> 27:00.740
To Siobhan.

27:00.780 --> 27:02.160
Happy birthday,
darling.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.160
Thank you.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.080
Sparkling cider.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.250
Really?

27:08.290 --> 27:09.660
Well, it is
Siobhan's birthday,

27:09.710 --> 27:11.120
and if she can't drink,
it hardly seems fair

27:11.170 --> 27:12.960
for the rest of
us to indulge.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.040
Since when is life fair?

27:17.170 --> 27:18.970
I can't believe
all these presents.

27:19.010 --> 27:20.510
It's too much.

27:20.550 --> 27:23.470
You can never get
enough presents.

27:23.510 --> 27:25.350
And the personal chef?

27:25.390 --> 27:26.890
I don't deserve all this.

27:26.930 --> 27:29.100
We're just getting started.

27:29.140 --> 27:30.850
You are happy with Giancarlo?

27:30.890 --> 27:32.440
'Cause the last time
we were at Del Cavalieri,

27:32.480 --> 27:34.730
you thought the branzino
was overcooked.

27:34.770 --> 27:36.900
Oh, it's great.

27:36.940 --> 27:38.070
I'm sure it's delicious.

27:38.110 --> 27:39.070
Mmm.

27:39.110 --> 27:41.950
Did you just
eat meat?

27:41.990 --> 27:43.200
Mm-hmm.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.330
But you haven't
touched meat for...

27:45.370 --> 27:46.330
Three years.

27:48.950 --> 27:50.160
I guess I just,

27:50.210 --> 27:52.000
I've been really
craving it

27:52.040 --> 27:55.210
since I'm pregnant, and thought
today was as good a day as any.

28:03.130 --> 28:04.180
Happy birthday.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.940
YOUNG SIOBHAN:
But it's our birthday.

28:12.980 --> 28:15.610
We can always
buy one and share.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.900
Like, forever?

28:17.940 --> 28:20.690
Hey, Siobhan.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.110
You OK?

28:22.150 --> 28:23.410
Yeah.

28:23.450 --> 28:25.200
Yeah, I'm sure
it's just the food.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.910
Um, excuse me for one second.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.510
SIOBHAN:
"Dear Bridget,

28:40.550 --> 28:43.050
"Thanks for sending back
the necklace.

28:43.090 --> 28:46.760
"Seeing it made me realize
how much I've missed you.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.930
"I know it's not our birthday,
but I wanted to return it.

28:50.970 --> 28:52.600
I hope you'll wear it
when you come visit me."

29:12.290 --> 29:13.250
[sniffles]

29:15.330 --> 29:16.540
Happy birthday, sis.

29:19.750 --> 29:22.510
HENRY:
You're wearing it.

29:22.550 --> 29:24.170
What?

29:24.220 --> 29:25.180
The necklace.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.510
I told you about this?

29:29.550 --> 29:30.640
You don't remember?

29:31.930 --> 29:33.930
You were, uh, pretty upset.

29:36.600 --> 29:40.230
I guess...it's hard...

29:40.270 --> 29:41.860
thinking about her.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.990
Your old friend.

29:44.030 --> 29:45.570
You didn't, you didn't
tell me her name,

29:45.610 --> 29:47.240
and you wouldn't put
the necklace on,

29:47.280 --> 29:50.780
but you couldn't stop
staring at it.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.200
Does this mean
that you guys made up?

29:57.290 --> 30:00.000
Wait. Last night, I was,
I was drunk and angry,

30:00.040 --> 30:03.420
and I had no right
to talk to you that way.

30:03.460 --> 30:04.840
No, you didn't.

30:04.880 --> 30:08.590
Listen, I have watched you
with Andrew for years.

30:10.390 --> 30:11.850
And you are so good
at pretending,

30:11.890 --> 30:13.970
that no one would ever guess
there is nothing there,

30:14.020 --> 30:16.180
unlike, unlike me and Gemma.

30:16.230 --> 30:17.190
Henry, don't do this.

30:17.230 --> 30:19.600
But when
you were with me,

30:19.650 --> 30:22.020
it was like something else.

30:22.070 --> 30:26.150
And you had this look, like...

30:26.190 --> 30:29.740
like I was the only person in
the world that mattered to you.

30:29.780 --> 30:31.620
I lived for that look.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.160
Tonight...

30:36.200 --> 30:39.080
with Andrew...

30:39.120 --> 30:41.250
you were looking at him
that way.

30:43.710 --> 30:45.050
I don't know
what to say.

30:45.090 --> 30:49.050
I just don't
understand it, Shiv.

30:49.090 --> 30:51.220
But I do love you.

30:51.260 --> 30:53.600
And if walking away

30:53.640 --> 30:56.810
is what you want
to be happy, then...

30:56.850 --> 30:59.850
it's gonna kill me,
but I'll do it.

30:59.890 --> 31:02.650
It's what I want.

31:02.690 --> 31:03.650
OK.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.240
That's not everything, though.

31:08.280 --> 31:12.410
You, um, you're pregnant.

31:12.450 --> 31:13.410
And we both know...

31:13.450 --> 31:15.240
We don't know.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.040
That baby is ours.

31:18.080 --> 31:21.290
Henry, can you
just trust me?

31:21.330 --> 31:23.920
Have the patience to know
that we'll figure this out?

31:25.800 --> 31:26.750
Please?

31:52.780 --> 31:53.740
Coming?

31:56.370 --> 31:57.990
Hey.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.580
Come on.

31:59.620 --> 32:00.750
You OK?

32:00.790 --> 32:01.750
Fine.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.680
So, did I finally
get a birthday right?

32:16.720 --> 32:17.890
It's stunning.

32:17.930 --> 32:20.520
I...I don't know what to say.

32:31.860 --> 32:33.610
Goodness, this all
looks incredible.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.240
Thank you so much.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.160
My pleasure.
Your favorite.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.990
Gemma, can I interest you
in a little glass of vino?

32:40.040 --> 32:41.250
You're finally
letting us drink.

32:41.290 --> 32:42.460
Sweet relief.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.960
I can't believe
you did all this.

32:46.000 --> 32:46.960
It's amazing.

32:49.340 --> 32:51.880
Oh, my goodness.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.300
You gonna eat all these?

32:53.340 --> 32:54.510
No, you're welcome to it.

32:54.550 --> 32:55.510
Mmm.

32:55.550 --> 32:57.100
Thank you, Andrew.

32:57.140 --> 32:58.260
BRIDGET:
Thank you all for coming.

32:58.300 --> 32:59.310
Bon appétit.

32:59.350 --> 33:02.390
Cheers.

33:02.430 --> 33:04.390
[Bridget and Andrew talking,
voices fading]

33:07.520 --> 33:09.480
[laughter,
indistinct conversations]

33:17.990 --> 33:19.580
Oh, my goodness!

33:19.620 --> 33:22.200
No singing. No singing.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.500
Oh, come on.
<b></b>
No singing.

33:24.540 --> 33:26.710
It's a piece of art.
We can't cut that.

33:26.750 --> 33:29.790
HENRY:
Great looking cake, Andrew.

33:29.840 --> 33:30.800
I--I can't.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.050
I can't. I'm sorry.

33:35.260 --> 33:36.260
Gemma?

33:36.300 --> 33:37.800
ANDREW:
What's going on?

33:37.840 --> 33:39.220
Did you say something to her?

33:39.260 --> 33:42.140
No, no, I'll go...I'll...
<b></b>
No, no.

33:42.180 --> 33:43.180
You stay. I'll go.

33:43.220 --> 33:44.480
She'll-she'll talk to me.

34:05.250 --> 34:06.290
[door opens]

34:07.960 --> 34:09.330
[sighs]

34:09.380 --> 34:12.420
Your breakfast, madame.

34:12.460 --> 34:14.760
One night with me and you're
already speaking French?

34:14.800 --> 34:16.130
Uh, one word a night.

34:16.170 --> 34:18.300
This is gonna take
a long, long time.

34:18.340 --> 34:20.050
Thank God.

34:20.090 --> 34:22.470
Maybe we should double up
on the lessons.

34:22.510 --> 34:25.180
Mmm...mm...mm...

34:27.390 --> 34:29.690
There is nothing that
I would like more.

34:29.730 --> 34:31.770
Unfortunately, I
have to go to work.

34:31.810 --> 34:32.940
But first...

34:37.110 --> 34:38.490
We never had
cake last night,

34:38.530 --> 34:42.120
and, we are in Paris, so...

34:42.160 --> 34:43.660
Thank you. I love it.

34:49.370 --> 34:52.210
Oh, uh, I ran into the manager
while I was downstairs.

34:54.630 --> 34:55.920
I actually know
him pretty well.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.760
My company does a lot
of overseas business.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.760
Clients travel here
from all over,

34:59.800 --> 35:01.640
so we have an account
with the hotel.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.050
It seems that he was
unaware that we have

35:03.100 --> 35:05.560
a very valued client
in town now--

35:05.600 --> 35:11.350
Cora Farrell--who will be
staying here indefinitely.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.110
Tyler, you can't do that. You
could get in serious trouble.

35:14.150 --> 35:16.780
We have clients in and out
of town constantly.

35:16.820 --> 35:19.240
No one even blinks
at the charges.

35:19.280 --> 35:22.370
I can't believe
you did that for me.

35:22.410 --> 35:25.830
You have no idea
what it means to me.

35:25.870 --> 35:27.910
It means that you can go
out with me again tonight.

35:34.210 --> 35:37.920
Mmm. Have you seen
my tie, by any chance?

35:37.960 --> 35:40.630
Um, check the bathroom.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.630
Will do.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.440
[water running]

35:58.360 --> 35:59.320
[water stops]

36:07.990 --> 36:10.120
Ah...
For you.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.210
Thank you.

36:11.250 --> 36:13.040
I will pick you up at 7:00.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.040
OK.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.140
[door closes]

36:26.470 --> 36:27.470
[phone beeps]

36:34.150 --> 36:35.810
The plan is back on.

36:35.860 --> 36:41.820
Tyler Barrett just extended my
hotel stay, on the company dime.

36:41.860 --> 36:44.660
This is gonna be easier
than we thought.

36:44.700 --> 36:45.660
Gemma?

36:48.490 --> 36:50.160
Gemma!
<b></b>
[phone beeps]

36:53.750 --> 36:55.710
Gemma?

36:55.750 --> 36:57.170
[sighs]

36:57.210 --> 37:00.090
Please pick up your phone
or call me back, just...

37:00.130 --> 37:02.470
Let me know you're OK.
I'm worried about you.

37:02.510 --> 37:03.470
[hangs up]

37:09.430 --> 37:10.810
MACHADO:
You really shouldn't
leave your door open.

37:14.810 --> 37:17.150
You can't be here.
This is private property.

37:17.190 --> 37:18.610
This is a courtesy visit.

37:18.650 --> 37:20.150
One last chance for
you to come clean.

37:22.780 --> 37:24.740
I know you're lying to me.

37:24.780 --> 37:27.780
Bridget was in the
Hamptons, with you.

37:27.820 --> 37:29.660
This has to stop.

37:29.700 --> 37:31.950
[phone beeps]
<b></b>
No more talking
to my friends, my...

37:31.990 --> 37:34.080
BRIDGET:
Hello? Hello? It's my sister!

37:34.120 --> 37:35.120
Can anyone hear me?

37:38.500 --> 37:41.840
Hello? It's my sister!
Can anyone hear me?

37:44.220 --> 37:45.880
I bet you didn't know
the, uh, the Coast Guard

37:45.930 --> 37:48.260
records all the distress calls
that it receives.

37:48.300 --> 37:49.600
They have a
dedicated channel.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.180
Most radios are
tuned to it

37:51.220 --> 37:54.390
by default, so chances are,
you pick up your boat radio,

37:54.430 --> 37:56.600
you're talking
to the Coast Guard.

37:56.640 --> 37:57.980
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.610
Cut the crap.

37:59.650 --> 38:02.980
You were with your
sister on the boat.

38:03.030 --> 38:06.030
Something happened that
made you make this call.

38:06.070 --> 38:07.490
What happened?

38:07.530 --> 38:11.370
OK, you're right.

38:11.410 --> 38:14.410
I was with my sister that day.

38:14.450 --> 38:15.580
She showed up. I...

38:15.620 --> 38:17.750
Because you invited her.

38:17.790 --> 38:18.790
We found her duffel bag.

38:22.340 --> 38:24.340
It was nice, at first.

38:24.380 --> 38:27.220
We connected.

38:27.260 --> 38:30.010
And then, Bridget told me
what she was mixed up in.

38:30.050 --> 38:32.010
She was just trying
to fix things.

38:32.050 --> 38:35.470
I--I understand that now,
but at the time, I...

38:35.520 --> 38:38.100
I was shocked, and...

38:38.140 --> 38:41.060
We fought. I...

38:41.110 --> 38:44.980
I was afraid
that she might hurt me.

38:45.030 --> 38:47.610
That's why I made the call.
I told her that was it.

38:47.650 --> 38:51.120
I--I never wanted
to see her again.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.160
That was the last time
I saw her.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.660
How'd you know where to find
Bridget's duffel bag?

38:55.700 --> 38:58.830
I found the key,
after she had gone.

38:58.870 --> 39:01.330
I thought it might
be hers.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.790
I went to get the bag to look,
to see if there was anything

39:03.840 --> 39:06.340
that might lead me
to where she was.

39:06.380 --> 39:07.630
I'm just trying to do

39:07.670 --> 39:09.380
the same thing that you are,
Agent Machado.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.470
I'm just trying
to keep Bridget safe.

39:11.510 --> 39:13.390
Why'd you withdraw all
that money last week?

39:13.430 --> 39:15.100
Because I needed it.

39:15.140 --> 39:18.230
There's no law against spending
your own money, is there?

39:18.270 --> 39:20.640
I don't know what you
want from me, Agent Machado.

39:20.690 --> 39:23.610
I'm only trying
to protect my sister.

39:23.650 --> 39:26.900
You can search my house,
my apartments if you want.

39:26.940 --> 39:30.280
You can follow me around
for the rest of my life,

39:30.320 --> 39:33.030
but I promise you,
you won't find Bridget.

39:35.660 --> 39:36.790
I think you know the way out.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.720
[beeping]

40:01.980 --> 40:04.190
Bridget's sponsor.

40:04.230 --> 40:06.400
You never stop lying, do you?

40:08.940 --> 40:10.110
[clattering]

40:12.740 --> 40:16.950
Gemma, I've been looking
all over for you.

40:16.990 --> 40:19.540
That's for sleeping with
my husband, you whore.

40:25.460 --> 40:29.460
How could you? I thought you
were my friend, my best friend.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.340
I opened up to you about
everything. God, you were

40:31.380 --> 40:33.840
the one trying to convince me
Henry wasn't having an affair.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.720
I'm so stupid!

40:35.760 --> 40:39.100
It's not what you think.
<b></b>
I heard you, Siobhan.
You and Henry.

40:39.140 --> 40:40.850
How much he loves you.

40:40.890 --> 40:44.440
How you're pregnant
with his baby.

40:44.480 --> 40:47.190
I'm so sorry that you heard
that, OK? I feel horrible...

40:47.230 --> 40:48.940
Oh, I'm sorry.
You feel horrible?

40:48.980 --> 40:51.070
I'm sorry, I don't
want you to feel bad.

40:51.110 --> 40:53.740
Why don't you sleep
with my husband and see if
that makes you feel better?

40:53.780 --> 40:55.530
I didn't mean it
like that, OK?

40:55.570 --> 40:57.740
It's just, it's more
complicated than you know...

40:57.780 --> 40:59.950
Hell yeah, it is.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.000
Think of what this is
gonna do to Andrew.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.040
Though I am going
to enjoy the look

41:04.080 --> 41:05.710
on your face when I tell him.

41:05.750 --> 41:08.340
I hope you look exactly the way
I do now.

41:08.380 --> 41:11.170
Please don't do this.
You don't understand.
<b></b>
Get out of my way, you bitch.

41:11.210 --> 41:13.630
Please, just look at me.
<b></b>
What, Siobhan? What?

41:13.670 --> 41:15.680
Because there is nothing
you could possibly say

41:15.720 --> 41:18.720
to make this OK.
<b></b>
I'm not who you think I am.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.560
I'm not Siobhan.

41:24.770 --> 41:26.060
I'm Bridget.
