00:04.304 --> 00:07.501
If a friend gets involved in a
relationship, it affects your friendship.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.734
Because you're like a comedy team,
and now there's this third person.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.174
It kind of throws off the timing:
"Who's on first?"

00:13.346 --> 00:14.574
"l don't know.

00:14.748 --> 00:18.013
Dear, who do you think
is on first?"

00:19.219 --> 00:22.552
Whenever a friend starts with
a new girlfriend, he should just say:

00:22.722 --> 00:24.622
"l look like the person
you used to know...

00:24.791 --> 00:28.249
...but I've been modified
to survive in this relationship.

00:28.428 --> 00:31.192
In other words, if we're having
an argument and she's there...

00:31.364 --> 00:33.355
...I may say,
'l totally disagree with you.'

00:33.533 --> 00:34.557
But what that means is:

00:34.734 --> 00:38.431
'I'd like to help you out, but I'd rather
continue to see her naked.'"

00:45.145 --> 00:47.545
Okay, cowboys, what will you have?

00:47.714 --> 00:50.376
I'll have the turkey club
without the bacon.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.982
And I'll have the bacon club
without the turkey.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.983
George, don't make me
get tough with you.

00:57.323 --> 00:59.314
Why? You think you can
beat me up?

00:59.492 --> 01:02.984
You wouldn't want me to mess up
that beautiful face of yours.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.461
Stop it. Stop it.

01:06.533 --> 01:09.764
You don't want bacon.
I'll surprise you.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.131
-Is she not terrific?
-She does have a way.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.741
You think she thinks
I have a beautiful face?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.470
Well, they do work on tips.

01:20.213 --> 01:23.046
"George, don't make me
get tough with you."

01:24.117 --> 01:26.813
Who says that? She is really cool.

01:26.986 --> 01:28.851
What do you think?
You think she likes me?

01:29.022 --> 01:31.183
I should've got the egg-white omelet.

01:31.558 --> 01:35.426
Why should she like me? Who am l?
There's a million people to like.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.587
The omelet. Damn.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.325
Maybe she could like me.
Is it that far-fetched?

01:41.501 --> 01:44.197
Maybe she sees something.
Is it possible?

01:44.370 --> 01:47.430
-No. Not possible.
-No. Not possible.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.405
-Hey.
-Hey, Laney.

01:50.577 --> 01:53.375
-How was the trip?
-What trip? You were gone?

01:53.546 --> 01:55.741
I went to England.

01:56.349 --> 01:58.681
With Mr. Pitt, for five days?

02:01.121 --> 02:03.112
-How was it?
-Actually, it was great.

02:03.289 --> 02:06.781
I met an Englishman,
and we really hit it off.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.958
Well, that relationship has
obviously got a lot of potential.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.427
Yeah, well, Jerome...

02:11.598 --> 02:15.432
...I happen to be flying him in
on my frequent-flier miles.

02:15.602 --> 02:18.537
Flying him in?
How long is he staying for?

02:18.705 --> 02:22.334
It's an open-ended ticket.
He can return anytime he wants.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.534
All this in five days.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.804
Oh, no. It's Kenny Bania.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.847
-Who's he?
-He's this awful comedian.

02:30.016 --> 02:32.143
-Hey, Jerry.
-Hey, Kenny.

02:33.052 --> 02:35.520
-Elaine, George.
-Hi.

02:35.855 --> 02:38.824
-How's it going?
-Great. I've been working out.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.926
Went from a size 40 to a 42.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.923
-No kidding?
-Yeah. I'm huge.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.993
-Well, I'll leave you guys alone.
-Okay, thanks.

02:48.902 --> 02:52.269
Oh, Jerry, you know
what just hit me? I was thinking--

02:52.438 --> 02:55.168
-What size suit are you?
-I'm a 40. Why?

02:55.341 --> 02:58.708
I just got a brand-new Armani suit,
doesn't fit me anymore. You want it?

02:59.479 --> 03:00.503
Well, I don't know if--

03:00.680 --> 03:02.580
Oh, come on.
Why should it sit in a closet?

03:02.749 --> 03:06.185
-An Armani suit?
-Take the suit.

03:07.086 --> 03:10.283
Well, okay, I guess.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.356
-You gonna be home later?
-Yeah.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.686
I'll drop it off.

03:15.361 --> 03:19.354
-Hey, new suit!
-Yeah, yeah. Lucky me.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.530
Here, I personally made you
a cold chicken sandwich.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.033
It's not even on the menu.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.733
Oh, this is fabulous.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.133
Boy, she is nice.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.870
I like her. I like her, Jerry.
She's got substance.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.911
She oozes substance.

03:35.081 --> 03:37.641
Well, go in there and talk to her.

03:37.817 --> 03:40.081
She's not gonna put them
on the glass.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.281
You mean the walk back in?

03:43.456 --> 03:45.583
That's the toughest move
in the business.

03:46.025 --> 03:47.720
You're sending me
into no man's land...

03:47.894 --> 03:50.158
...and if I get shot down,
I have to crawl back.

03:50.463 --> 03:51.896
Well, I can't do it, I tell you!

03:52.065 --> 03:55.466
Pull yourself together.
You're going in there, soldier.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.364
That's an order!

04:00.106 --> 04:01.232
Get in there.

04:05.044 --> 04:06.602
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.337
Listen, I need you
to do me a favor.

04:08.514 --> 04:10.573
-What?
-Help me move my refrigerator.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.581
-Why?
-Because I'm getting rid of it.

04:15.655 --> 04:18.988
-Yeah?
-<i>It's K.B. I have the suit.</i>

04:19.158 --> 04:21.250
All right, come on up.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.759
-So....
-Why get rid of your refrigerator?

04:23.930 --> 04:26.262
After that kidney stone,
I only want fresh food.

04:26.432 --> 04:30.425
It's gotta be fresh.
I'm not eating any more stored food.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.264
Plus, you know, I want the space.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.839
-What for?
-Well, I could put a dresser in there.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.978
I could get dressed
while I'm making breakfast.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.436
Hey!

04:42.048 --> 04:43.413
-Here you go.
-Yeah.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.108
Didn't think I was really gonna
give you a suit, did you?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.982
-You're giving him this suit?
-That's right. And it's Armani.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.713
Armani?

04:50.890 --> 04:54.451
-Hey, Armani, Jerry.
-Yes, yes, I heard.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.595
-Come on, try it on.
-No, it's okay.

04:56.763 --> 04:59.231
-Come on. I want to see how it fits.
-All right.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.731
-There you go.
-There, okay?

05:01.901 --> 05:03.960
Oh, boy. Look at that.
That looks great.

05:04.537 --> 05:08.633
-I can't believe you're giving him this.
-And I don't even want anything for it.

05:11.911 --> 05:15.472
-He's very generous, isn't he?
-Yes. Yes, he is.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.509
I'll tell you what, you can take me
out to dinner sometime.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.511
-Dinner?
-Yeah, you buy me a meal.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.715
-Can't get a better deal than that.
-You'll never get a better deal.

05:25.892 --> 05:28.417
-All right, I'll leave you alone.
-Yeah, yeah.

05:28.594 --> 05:30.653
Look at that. Armani. Yeah.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.390
Yeah, that's a deal.
That's a terrible deal.

05:33.566 --> 05:37.730
I don't want to go out to dinner
with him. I'd rather make my own suit.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.169
-I did it. It's all done.
-Hey.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.774
I did it. We're going out
as soon as she gets off work.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.204
And it'll still be daytime.

05:44.377 --> 05:47.039
I'm better in the daytime than at night.
It's less pressure.

05:47.213 --> 05:48.737
I love the day date.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.883
-No wine, no shower.
-There you go.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.446
-So the trip was good?
-Yes.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.748
Apart from that dreadful airline food.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.222
Wreaked absolute havoc
with my stomach.

06:01.027 --> 06:04.190
You know, I have to say,
I've never admitted this to anyone...

06:04.364 --> 06:08.198
...but I kind of like airline food.

06:11.304 --> 06:14.068
That's probably because of....

06:14.240 --> 06:16.003
What?

06:17.243 --> 06:20.542
-What?
-Yeah, what?

06:22.648 --> 06:24.240
What?

06:24.417 --> 06:26.612
Where I come from,
we don't say "what."

06:26.786 --> 06:29.311
It's proper to say "pardon."

06:30.790 --> 06:33.122
Oh, this should be interesting.

06:33.292 --> 06:36.159
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

06:37.630 --> 06:41.999
So then, about a year ago, I started
selling these funky little hair clips.

06:42.168 --> 06:45.934
It's going pretty good.
I make them in my apartment.

06:46.105 --> 06:49.370
I'm just waitressing because I wanted
to go to Europe this summer...

06:49.542 --> 06:51.908
...and I could use a few extra--
Careful.

06:52.078 --> 06:56.139
Oh, it's just horse manure.
Horse manure's not that bad.

06:56.315 --> 06:58.579
I don't even mind
the word "manure."

06:58.751 --> 07:00.776
You know, it's "nure,"
which is good...

07:00.953 --> 07:03.979
...and a "ma" in front of it.
Manure.

07:04.157 --> 07:08.651
When you consider the other choices,
"manure" is actually pretty refreshing.

07:10.296 --> 07:12.457
-That's a nice watch, George.
-Yeah.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.226
You know, my boyfriend
has the same one.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.827
-Really?
-Yeah, he loves watches.

07:19.005 --> 07:21.735
-He's a real watch freak.
-Well, how about that?

07:21.908 --> 07:25.935
-Oh, look out. You stepped right in it.
-Yes. I sure did.

07:28.481 --> 07:30.449
So you just pretended
it didn't bother you?

07:30.616 --> 07:32.948
What is that? Boyfriend?
I don't understand that.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.883
What does she think
I asked her out for?

07:36.055 --> 07:39.115
It's the way they just slip it
in there too.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.261
Yeah, like it's all just part
of the conversation.

07:42.428 --> 07:45.761
"My boyfriend really likes watches.
He's a real watch freak."

07:45.932 --> 07:49.333
Well, that's fabulous.

07:50.536 --> 07:54.028
Well, let me ask you this. What exactly
did you say when you asked her out?

07:54.407 --> 07:57.103
I said, "Would you like
to go for a walk or something?"

07:57.276 --> 08:02.373
-Oh, a walk? Well....
-Or something. I said "or something."

08:03.316 --> 08:05.147
Or something?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.650
-Yeah, that's a date.
-There you go.

08:08.354 --> 08:11.653
Of course, there is always the
possibility that she called an audible.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.258
-What do you mean?
-She got to the line of scrimmage...

08:14.427 --> 08:17.555
...didn't like the looks of the defense
and changed the play.

08:20.633 --> 08:24.763
I think things were going okay.
We were having a nice conversation.

08:24.937 --> 08:27.428
I mentioned how I liked
horse manure.

08:29.308 --> 08:31.936
-You did?
-Yeah.

08:32.979 --> 08:36.005
-You said you liked horse manure?
-Yeah.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.811
You know, about how, when you break
it down, it's really a very positive thing.

08:40.986 --> 08:44.582
You know, you have a "nure"
with a "ma" in front of it.

08:44.757 --> 08:48.591
Manure. It's not bad.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.620
And it was around this point
she mentioned the boyfriend?

08:51.797 --> 08:53.264
Yeah.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.662
Oh, you think because
of what I said about the manure?

08:58.838 --> 09:01.033
I was just saying how
it takes a negative thing...

09:01.207 --> 09:02.731
...and puts a positive spin on it.

09:02.909 --> 09:06.037
I'm just saying there's a chance
she may not have been enamored...

09:06.212 --> 09:09.375
...with your thoughts and feelings
on manure.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.873
So you don't think
she really has a boyfriend.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.985
My honest opinion?
I think she made it up.

09:14.854 --> 09:17.254
Well, then she's just a liar,
isn't she?

09:18.024 --> 09:19.753
Hey.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.256
You want something to eat,
don't you?

09:22.428 --> 09:24.589
Oh, no, no, no.
You got me all wrong, buddy.

09:24.764 --> 09:28.530
I am loving this no refrigerator.
You know what I discovered?

09:28.701 --> 09:33.934
I really like depriving myself of things.
It's fun. Very monastic.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.241
-Well, what do you eat?
-It's all fresh.

09:36.409 --> 09:41.346
Fresh fish, fresh fowl, fresh fruit.
I buy it. I eat it.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.648
-Well, I'm glad it's working out.
-Oh, yeah. It's working out.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.752
And I got a date with that waitress
who works at Reggie's.

09:48.220 --> 09:51.678
Boy, if I could meet a hostess,
we could open up our own place.

09:52.191 --> 09:55.160
Yeah. Well, I'll tell you,
she's a full-figured gal.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.425
-Is she?
-Oh, you better believe it, buddy.

09:59.231 --> 10:01.927
-George, we could double sometime.
-Yeah, yeah, we could.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.763
You know, Kramer,
the next time you talk to her...

10:04.937 --> 10:07.098
...find out if she knows Kelly
from Monk's.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.264
I want to know
if she really has a boyfriend.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.501
All right, let's get over here.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.702
-Hello.
-Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.871
-Oh, hi.
-<i>I was thinking, if you're not busy...</i>

10:17.049 --> 10:19.108
...maybe I can get my meal today?

10:21.000 --> 10:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:29.395 --> 10:32.159
Yeah, you want to get that meal,
don't you?

10:32.965 --> 10:35.297
How about Mendy's.
Ever been there?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.231
-No, I haven't.
-<i>You're gonna love it.</i>

10:37.403 --> 10:39.735
-I'll meet you there around 7.
-All right.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.670
Yeah, I really needed that suit.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.741
I start off with curls.
That's good for the bicep.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.143
I do 10 reps, two sets.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.741
That's fantastic.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.510
-You work out with weights?
-I don't.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.917
-You should.
-Why?

11:01.661 --> 11:04.095
-You worn the suit yet?
-No, not yet.

11:04.263 --> 11:07.562
-Have you decided?
-Oh, get the swordfish.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.759
Best swordfish in the city.
The best, Jerry.

11:10.936 --> 11:13.097
I'll have the salmon.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.428
And you?

11:14.607 --> 11:17.508
You know what I think?
I'm just gonna have soup.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.510
Yeah, I'll save the meal
for another time.

11:24.950 --> 11:28.010
Another time? What other time?

11:28.187 --> 11:31.122
I had a hot dog earlier.
I'm not that hungry.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.554
No, no, Bania, no.

11:34.060 --> 11:38.087
This is the dinner.
The soup counts.

11:42.768 --> 11:45.202
Soup's not a meal.
You're supposed to buy me a meal.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.431
I'm not stopping you from eating.
Go ahead. Get anything you want.

11:48.607 --> 11:52.407
-But I don't want anything but soup.
-Then that's the meal.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.368
But I had the hot dog.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.742
Who told you to have a hot dog?

11:56.916 --> 12:00.044
Hey, I give you
a brand-new Armani suit...

12:00.219 --> 12:01.914
...and you won't even
buy me a meal.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.820
All right, fine. Get the soup.

12:11.163 --> 12:14.064
So he just gets soup.
He wants to save the meal.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.928
So now I got to do it
all over again.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.093
What kind of soup did he get?

12:18.604 --> 12:21.004
I don't know.
Consommé or something.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.573
-Consommé.
-What?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.938
Well, that's really not a meal, Jerry.

12:26.112 --> 12:29.604
I mean, if he had gotten
chicken gumbo or matzo ball...

12:29.782 --> 12:32.114
...even mushroom barley,
then I would agree with you.

12:32.284 --> 12:34.149
Those are very hearty soups.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.845
-You're missing the whole point.
-What?

12:37.022 --> 12:39.115
The meal is the act
of sitting down with him.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.724
It doesn't matter what you get.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.953
As long as he's sitting
in that restaurant, it's a meal.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.963
-Was it a cup or a bowl?
-You see? Again.

12:47.133 --> 12:50.102
-I'm just curious.
-A bowl, okay?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.260
Did he crumble any crackers in it?

12:53.773 --> 12:56.105
Did he crumble any crackers in it?

12:56.275 --> 12:58.004
As a matter of fact, he did.

12:58.177 --> 13:03.581
Oh, well, crackers in a bowl.
That could be a meal.

13:04.884 --> 13:08.149
It's like I'm talking
to my aunt Sylvia here.

13:08.554 --> 13:12.081
-Hi, Simon. This is Jerry.
-Hello.

13:12.258 --> 13:15.284
-Elaine, do you have cash on you?
-Yeah, in my purse.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.452
No, there was only $6.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.699
Well, I have some money.
What do you need?

13:21.867 --> 13:24.461
Twenty should cover me.
Thanks, mate.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.164
-Where are you going?
-Just visiting.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.867
-Okay. See you later.
-I won't be back for dinner.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.403
Pardon?

13:38.751 --> 13:41.311
-So is she working? Is she here?
-Yeah, yeah, she's here.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.819
-Have you said anything?
-No. I'm very uncomfortable.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.514
-Are you gonna say anything?
-I don't know. I don't know.

13:46.692 --> 13:48.159
-Hello.
-Hello.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.557
Well, what's it going to be?

13:51.831 --> 13:55.232
-"What's it gonna be?"
-Yes. What will you have?

13:55.401 --> 13:58.199
Are you eating?
It's in that vein.

13:59.305 --> 14:03.298
-I'll just have a bowl of chili.
-I'll have an egg-white omelet.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.877
-"What's it gonna be?" Hear that?
-Yeah, that was bad.

14:08.047 --> 14:09.275
Did you feel that tension?

14:09.448 --> 14:11.848
We used to have banter.
There's no more banter.

14:12.017 --> 14:16.147
Oh, no. It's Kenny.
Slide out so he can't sit here.

14:18.324 --> 14:20.485
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.289
-You worn the suit yet?
-Actually I did.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.953
I put it on last night
and slept in it.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.567
-You did?
-No, I'm joking.

14:33.672 --> 14:35.765
Can I squeeze in?

14:35.941 --> 14:37.841
Sure you can.

14:41.347 --> 14:42.575
Thanks.

14:42.748 --> 14:46.377
-Can I take your order?
-What kind of soup do you have?

14:46.552 --> 14:48.884
Why don't you get a sandwich.

14:49.054 --> 14:52.421
Okay. I'll have tomato soup
and tuna on toast.

14:52.591 --> 14:56.152
Okay. This is it, you know.

14:58.097 --> 15:01.589
This is the meal.
So stock up, buddy boy.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.597
What are you talking about?
This isn't a meal.

15:05.771 --> 15:09.332
Yes, it is. Soup and sandwich.
That is a meal.

15:09.808 --> 15:13.608
You're supposed to buy me dinner
in a nice restaurant like Mendy's.

15:13.779 --> 15:17.078
-I tried to do that.
-This is lunch in a coffee shop.

15:17.249 --> 15:20.184
It doesn't matter. This is it.
This completes the transaction.

15:20.686 --> 15:24.281
Oh, soup and a sandwich
for a brand-new Armani suit.

15:24.456 --> 15:27.653
-Is that any kind of a gesture?
-I'm really not comfortable--

15:27.826 --> 15:30.624
Hey, I just spoke to Hildy
about your friend.

15:30.796 --> 15:32.388
-Yeah?
-She doesn't have a boyfriend.

15:32.564 --> 15:33.929
She made it up.

15:44.977 --> 15:45.966
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:46.145 --> 15:48.443
-Where's Simon?
-Oh, he'll be right up.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.208
He's just getting some beer.

15:51.383 --> 15:55.046
And I'm not expecting any change.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.989
-When's he leaving?
-About two days.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.921
Although he's hinting
at how he'd like to stay.

16:01.093 --> 16:04.893
Fortunately, he has no money
and no prospects.

16:05.064 --> 16:07.828
-Hey, mate. Fancy a beer?
-No, thanks.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.429
Hello?

16:12.604 --> 16:16.131
No, I'm sorry, Bania.
I'm not going over this again.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.106
Well, who told you to order soup?

16:19.278 --> 16:23.408
No, there's no dinner.
There's not going to be any dinner.

16:23.582 --> 16:27.780
You've had a sandwich
and two bowls of soup, and that's it.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.282
Goodbye.

16:32.624 --> 16:34.717
-Hey, what size suit are you?
-Forty.

16:34.893 --> 16:36.884
Forty. Perfect.

16:37.062 --> 16:39.895
-Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
-Absolutely.

16:40.065 --> 16:42.829
Great. It's yours.
I can't stand the sight of it.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.197
-Elaine, here's the car keys.
-Thanks.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.206
-Yep.
-<i>Listen, Jerry.</i>

16:48.374 --> 16:51.366
I been doing some thinking.
I want my suit back.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.443
I don't have your suit.
I gave it away.

16:53.612 --> 16:57.343
-<i>Well, it's my suit.</i>
-Well, it's gone.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.882
I'm sorry. Goodbye, Bania.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.281
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:02.454 --> 17:03.648
Yeah.

17:05.156 --> 17:07.090
-Well, how's everything?
-Okay.

17:07.259 --> 17:08.657
Good.

17:08.827 --> 17:11.159
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

17:11.797 --> 17:13.230
Really?

17:14.465 --> 17:16.127
You want food, don't you?

17:16.468 --> 17:19.868
It's not for me, it's for Hildy,
the waitress I was telling you about.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.904
She's hungry. She wants food.

17:22.074 --> 17:25.976
If I go back in there without any food,
there's gonna be trouble.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.774
All right, go ahead.

17:33.852 --> 17:35.581
-Did you find anything?
-Yeah.

17:36.855 --> 17:39.585
There's a few things in here.
Peanut butter, cheese. Yeah.

17:39.758 --> 17:41.589
-Cheese is good. What kind?
-Swiss.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.728
All right, it'll have to do. Come on.

17:45.164 --> 17:46.461
What are you doing out here?

17:46.632 --> 17:48.759
I can't go in there.
I'm too uncomfortable.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.629
So we're not gonna go
in there anymore?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.470
Hey, what are you doing out here?

17:53.639 --> 17:56.472
We can't eat here anymore,
because he took a waitress for a walk.

17:56.642 --> 17:59.475
What's the difference?
Let's go to Reggie's.

17:59.645 --> 18:03.172
-Reggie's? I can't eat anything there.
-It's the same menu.

18:03.348 --> 18:05.407
There's no big salad.

18:06.351 --> 18:07.784
They'll make you a big salad.

18:07.953 --> 18:11.286
What do you think, they're
the only ones that make a big salad?

18:11.957 --> 18:15.415
All right, let's go to Reggie's.

18:17.062 --> 18:19.189
So, what's going on with Simon?
Did he leave?

18:19.364 --> 18:21.832
Wait till you hear this.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.764
So Simon picks this woman up
right in front of me.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.337
Look at this. They make a point
of saying on the menu:

18:27.506 --> 18:29.701
"No egg-white omelets."
Look at that.

18:29.875 --> 18:33.311
So what? Have a yolk.
It won't kill you.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.606
-Hello.
-Oh, hi, Hildy.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.544
Could I get an egg-white omelet?

18:37.716 --> 18:41.880
-Did you read the menu?
-All right. Just give me a western.

18:42.221 --> 18:45.987
-How about a big salad?
-A big salad?

18:46.992 --> 18:48.755
-You see?
-Just tell her what you want.

18:48.927 --> 18:50.087
They'll make it for you.

18:51.029 --> 18:54.897
It's a salad, only bigger,
with lots of stuff in it.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.730
I can bring you two small salads.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.197
Could you put it in a big bowl?

19:01.373 --> 19:03.466
We don't have big bowls.

19:03.642 --> 19:07.134
-All right, just give me a cup of decaf.
-We have Sanka.

19:10.082 --> 19:12.778
I mean, it's not fair.
I've been going there for seven years.

19:12.951 --> 19:14.919
-She's been there three weeks.
-Not fair.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.817
If anyone should be forced to leave,
it should be her.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.753
She's on your turf.

19:19.925 --> 19:23.520
If only she could get fired.
Is there any way that could happen?

19:23.695 --> 19:26.220
I mean, I know how
to get myself fired.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.260
-You're the best.
-Well....

19:30.435 --> 19:31.925
How do I get someone else fired?

19:32.104 --> 19:33.093
Well, as I see it...

19:33.272 --> 19:36.105
...you've got to apply the same
principles that get you fired...

19:36.275 --> 19:39.506
...but redirected outwardly.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.337
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.537
She's hungry, Jerry.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.705
Well, there's nothing left.
There's no food.

19:44.883 --> 19:45.907
No food?

19:46.084 --> 19:50.214
Well, you gotta have something.
I can't go back in there with no food.

19:50.389 --> 19:51.913
She expecting something, Jerry.

19:52.558 --> 19:55.652
You don't know what she's like
when that blood sugar drops.

19:56.161 --> 19:59.062
There, you see, she's already
in a bad mood. She just got fired.

19:59.264 --> 20:00.424
Why did she get fired?

20:00.599 --> 20:02.726
Because I called over there
a couple of times...

20:02.901 --> 20:04.766
...and the manager didn't like it.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.601
Simon is definitely going back now.

20:12.778 --> 20:15.212
He's meeting me here
to return my keys.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.746
Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?

20:18.150 --> 20:21.551
Yes, he's one of those bounders.

20:21.887 --> 20:25.653
-Egg-white omelet, big salad.
-Thank you.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.224
I wanted you guys to know
that Friday is my last day.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.418
Bloomingdale's ordered
a bunch of my clips.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.461
Thank God. I don't have
to do this anymore.

20:36.835 --> 20:40.362
Hey, Jerry. Where's my suit?

20:40.539 --> 20:42.837
I don't have it.
You want half my omelet?

20:43.008 --> 20:45.499
I told you, she's busy.

20:45.677 --> 20:48.703
She can't come to the phone now.

20:50.849 --> 20:52.646
Tell your boyfriend
to stop calling here.

20:52.818 --> 20:53.842
He's not my boyfriend.

20:54.019 --> 20:57.113
It's that bald guy with the glasses
who's always here with them.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.655
He's trying to get me in trouble.

21:03.695 --> 21:06.323
Hey! Yeah.

21:06.498 --> 21:07.863
I got a message for you.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.929
You tell your friend George...

21:10.102 --> 21:12.400
...that the next time
I see him around here...

21:12.571 --> 21:16.940
...I'm gonna turn him into my own
personal hand puppet.

21:18.744 --> 21:21.736
Well, hello.
Here you are, as promised.

21:21.913 --> 21:23.710
You see, I'm a man of my word.

21:24.316 --> 21:27.683
-When are you leaving?
-Are you trying to get rid of me?

21:28.820 --> 21:32.278
I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but
I've been set up with a job interview...

21:32.457 --> 21:35.119
...that might enable me to extend
my visit indefinitely.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.956
And it is all due to this suit.

21:38.397 --> 21:40.228
How do I look?

21:40.399 --> 21:44.335
I'm a shoo-in, aren't l?
Thanks again, hon.

21:45.337 --> 21:47.464
Hey, Kenny. You still
wanna get that suit back?

21:47.639 --> 21:49.664
-Yeah.
-There it goes.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.776
Hey! Hey!

21:53.512 --> 21:54.774
Come here, you.

21:54.946 --> 21:57.676
-Wait, what are you--? Unhand me!
-Take it off!
