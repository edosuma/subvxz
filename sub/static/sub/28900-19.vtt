Rae, the dating website
wants a picture of
the side of my face!

00:21.188 --> 00:23.607
That's why it's called
a profile pic.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.694
You know what? Never mind!

00:27.694 --> 00:30.822
We are gonna find you a guy

(gasps) Well, this is
nothing short of...

00:45.587 --> 00:47.005
exhilarating!

Levi and I have been
practicing my vocabulary.

You know, it's like
I'm taking the SAT's
all over again,

00:58.183 --> 00:59.977
but this time, I'm awake.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.981
Is anybody else's
eyes watering
and throat closing up?

01:03.981 --> 01:06.608
Because something
really stinks in here!
What is that?

‐Oh, that's just your
brother's dirty laundry.

Try to make her look normal.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.495
So, thanks to your brother's
new‐found funk factor,

01:18.495 --> 01:21.498

laundry into lights,

He's sleeping in late
all the time.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.009
And yesterday,
I caught him eating
three plates of spaghetti.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.802
Eh, that's not so bad.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.012
For breakfast.

Clean enough.

Put it‐‐ No! No! No! No!

Of course, Mrs. Dunagan.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.799
This is a 30‐page report!

02:53.799 --> 02:55.717
It is. Enjoy!

02:56.301 --> 02:58.387
The assignment
was three pages, Nia.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.806
Following instructions
is a big part of your grade.

03:00.806 --> 03:03.850
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to give you an "F"
on this report.

03:05.727 --> 03:06.895
So, let me guess.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.064
Mrs. Dunagan's not even
reading your reports anymore.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.233
She's just giving you an "A"
because you're Nia?

03:11.983 --> 03:13.318
That's right!

this whisker.

You know what,
I think I see it!

03:29.292 --> 03:31.962
But it could also be
because I just wanna
see it so bad.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.423
The lighting's just not right.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.715
But trust me!

03:35.715 --> 03:37.759
It's a full‐on face whisker.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.762
Yep... becoming a man.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.097
Oh, yeah!

I mean, uh...
(clears throat)

03:43.723 --> 03:44.891

Yeah, yeah!

03:44.891 --> 03:47.185
Yeah, I know all about that
manhood too, you know!

03:47.185 --> 03:49.229

03:49.229 --> 03:52.065
he's not where
we are right now.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.025
So maybe you can
give him the what's what

03:54.025 --> 03:55.610
on some things he can
expect down the road.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.612
Levi really wants
to take notes.

03:59.906 --> 04:00.991

Just do it!

04:00.991 --> 04:03.076
(in normal voice):
Uh, so Vance, please go on.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.538
Well, becoming a man means
you start growing muscles.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.123
And don't worry.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.000
I've got a permit for these.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.295
And my dad is starting to
treat me with respect now.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.046
We had this big talk,

04:15.046 --> 04:17.841
and then he told me
I could ride ATVs
with him this weekend.

04:17.841 --> 04:18.967
Whoa!

04:18.967 --> 04:20.635
Yo, that's amazing, Vance!

04:20.635 --> 04:24.055
Did he say anything else
that, um, Levi needs to know
about manhood?

04:24.055 --> 04:26.308
Well, I asked him
a few more questions,

04:26.308 --> 04:27.809
but that's when
he told me to stop

04:27.809 --> 04:29.060
because he needed
some fresh air.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.063
So, I guess being a man means
you need to be outside a lot.

Yo, Levi, did you hear that?

Okay? Be the best!
Don't worry about me.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.254
Okay.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.263
Tess, I'm coming down.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.101
Oh! You see that?!

19:45.101 --> 19:46.936
My baby is giving up
the high score

19:46.936 --> 19:48.104
so she can help her friend!

19:48.104 --> 19:49.939

19:51.107 --> 19:52.316
It's a big deal!

19:56.278 --> 19:58.280
Yeah? You all right?

19:58.280 --> 20:00.074
Yeah, I can't believe
you came back for me.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.575
Of course I did.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.160
What about the high score?

20:04.245 --> 20:05.413
Look...

20:06.205 --> 20:07.456
You were right.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.292
I know I push myself
too hard!

20:11.001 --> 20:13.045
I'd like to care less.
I just don't know how.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.047
You just have to let go, Nia.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.882
Relax, and let go.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.801
Let go?

20:19.468 --> 20:21.053
I'm gonna let go.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.100
‐Oh!
‐Yeah! There ya go!

Oh baby, it's okay!
Mama's coming!

Stay calm!
I'm always here for you!

falling really slowly.

Wow!

Yo! Nia, watch this.

you hurt your ankle!

Oh! Yeah!

20:41.741 --> 20:43.075
(mockingly):
Ow.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.995
I raised her!

20:59.425 --> 21:00.926
How did you find me?

21:00.926 --> 21:03.429
Well, for one thing,
I knew you had enough sense

21:03.429 --> 21:05.556
not to leave this building
without permission.

21:05.556 --> 21:08.350
So all I had to do
was follow your scent.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.353
I was never going
to ride those ATVs.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.481
I was just...

21:14.732 --> 21:15.608
mad.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.109
I get it.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.069
I remember this age.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.448
You know, my father
used to always tell me,

21:22.448 --> 21:25.075
"Life has fence posts."

21:25.075 --> 21:26.911
For instance,

21:26.911 --> 21:28.829
you learn to walk.

21:28.829 --> 21:29.997
Fence post.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.416
You learn to read,

21:32.416 --> 21:34.126
fence post.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.836
You start school,

21:35.836 --> 21:37.254
fence post.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.299
See, and when you link
all those posts together,

21:40.299 --> 21:42.009
they form your life path.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.888
I'm guessing there's
no ATV fence post.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.725
Well, here's the thing
about your path so far.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.645
You've had two hands to hold.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.356
Me and your mama's.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.317
See, but you're at
a new post now.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.694
‐You're changing.
‐Thank you!

22:00.694 --> 22:03.155
That is what
I've been trying to say!

22:03.155 --> 22:04.865
You know what I'm saying?
I'm a man now!

22:05.574 --> 22:08.410
Look, you might be
the man of this house.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.830
But outside,
you're 13 years old.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.624
And your mom and I
are still in charge!

22:14.875 --> 22:17.253
But you're finding you
right now.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.420
That's plenty.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.506
I get that.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.800
But I do have some questions.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.469
Like, uh, do my muscles
start growing on their own?

22:25.469 --> 22:27.805
Oh! And when does
the voice squeak go away?

22:27.805 --> 22:30.641
Oh! And what lighting is best
if I wanna see my whiskers?

22:30.641 --> 22:32.643
Let me see that mug.

22:34.061 --> 22:37.147
Yeah, I'd say you got a while
before you got to worry
about those whiskers.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.402
Uh, are you crying, Dad?

22:43.112 --> 22:45.239
I am. Not from emotion!

22:45.239 --> 22:47.032
(tearfully):
No...

See, this is your daddy
doing the most right now.

Right, I think that's where

questions about all this?

Of course you can!

Day or night.

Yes, but I get

I'm the youngest!
I'm already at a disadvantage!
