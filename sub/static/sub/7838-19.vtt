00:25.179 --> 00:25.650
Hey, Kids!

00:25.700 --> 00:27.653
I scream, you scream, we all scream

00:27.903 --> 00:28.803
for...

00:29.700 --> 00:30.750
Haircuts!

00:36.418 --> 00:38.803
Mom, Bart and I have been talking....

00:39.053 --> 00:39.467
You have?

00:39.717 --> 00:41.156
That's so nice!

00:41.406 --> 00:43.750
What Lisa's trying to say is...

00:44.000 --> 00:46.359
there's a new kids' barbershop in the mall,

00:46.609 --> 00:48.650
and we'd like to start going there.

00:48.901 --> 00:49.859
A kids' barbershop?

00:50.100 --> 00:51.851
But they don't have my templates.

00:52.108 --> 00:54.065
Yeah, the templates had a great run.

00:54.318 --> 00:55.903
But we'd like our hair to look like...

00:56.503 --> 00:57.953
people hair.

00:58.317 --> 00:59.006
I see.

00:59.256 --> 01:01.750
Well, good luck getting to
your precious mall barber,

01:02.000 --> 01:03.159
cause I'm not driving you.

01:03.409 --> 01:04.750
Kids, wanna go to the mall?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.653
They're baking fresh Cinnabons...

01:06.903 --> 01:09.953
which means they're throwing out the old ones!

01:16.200 --> 01:18.450
I guess I'll just cut my own hair.

01:19.018 --> 01:20.768
Who wants their hair cut?

01:22.503 --> 01:24.253
Who wants their hair cut?

01:26.217 --> 01:27.967
Who wants their hair cut?

01:30.956 --> 01:32.750
Which side do you want your part on?

01:33.300 --> 01:34.029
Left! Right!

01:34.279 --> 01:34.950
Stab! Stab! Stab!

01:35.200 --> 01:36.650
You're the boss.

01:38.503 --> 01:39.853
What the hell...?

01:43.800 --> 01:46.668
Bart, you look worse than Aunt
Patty in the morning.

01:46.918 --> 01:48.103
And there ain't nothin'

01:48.353 --> 01:51.453
looks worse than Aunt Patty in the morning.

02:00.257 --> 02:01.357
Next!

02:02.556 --> 02:04.506
Can you make me look like this?

02:09.109 --> 02:10.949
My bad-boy spikes!

02:11.200 --> 02:13.050
My good-girl points!

02:15.103 --> 02:18.050
Children, the mall will provide
you a wide range of subjects,

02:18.300 --> 02:20.568
while I return some socks
that appeared to be black,

02:20.818 --> 02:22.803
but were in reality a very dark blue.

02:23.053 --> 02:26.467
The best photographs, or "photos",
will be prominently

02:26.717 --> 02:29.267
displayed in the school lobby all year long.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.700
After 'em!

02:39.800 --> 02:41.600
I love you, Dumpster-bons.

02:44.109 --> 02:45.053
Dad?

02:45.303 --> 02:46.450
Big surprise.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.400
The fat guy's eating garbage.

02:49.218 --> 02:49.863
Come on!

02:50.113 --> 02:52.013
We'll hide in the theater!

02:55.517 --> 02:58.306
Well, I guess you didn't find anything
interesting to photograph.

02:58.556 --> 02:59.050
Check it out!

02:59.300 --> 03:00.850
The Principal's got a shirt wiener!

03:06.079 --> 03:07.750
Leave your body, Seymour.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.650
Leave your body.

03:12.603 --> 03:14.053
Left Below.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.950
He Is Risen" production!

03:19.518 --> 03:21.353
I wish you'd come to church
with us, sweetheart.

03:21.603 --> 03:22.367
Church?

03:22.617 --> 03:25.417
I'd rather play golf on the
holiest day of the week.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.350
Finally, a character I can relate to.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.159
I bet good things happen to him.

03:30.409 --> 03:32.550
But, honey, with recent troubles in the Mideast

03:32.800 --> 03:36.153
and other ominous signs,
the Rapture could soon be upon us.

03:36.403 --> 03:37.450
The Rapture?

03:37.700 --> 03:38.868
Easy there, Helen.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.803
Science has shown religion is
just an old wives' tale.

03:42.053 --> 03:43.907
I'm sorry, but the only thing I'm praying for

03:44.157 --> 03:47.057
is that you take it easy on our credit cards.

03:52.756 --> 03:53.909
Oh, Mr. Thompson...

03:55.159 --> 03:56.650
what if your wife finds out?

03:56.900 --> 03:58.453
Hey, it's modern times.

03:58.703 --> 04:00.603
Everyone's doing it.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.700
Where did my Christian limo driver go?

04:08.418 --> 04:10.753
My pious husband is missing!

04:11.003 --> 04:13.753
The baby I chose to have baptized is gone!

04:16.416 --> 04:17.505
Mr. Thompson,

04:17.755 --> 04:18.750
what's happening?!

04:19.000 --> 04:19.759
It's the Rapture, Shawna.

04:20.009 --> 04:20.550
The Rapture.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.053
The virtuous have gone to heaven,

04:22.303 --> 04:26.353
and the rest of us have been left below!

04:26.700 --> 04:27.668
Left below?

04:27.918 --> 04:29.103
Where have I heard that before?

04:29.353 --> 04:31.117
It's the title of the movie.

04:31.417 --> 04:32.817
It's everywhere!

04:32.956 --> 04:34.050
We were fools!

04:34.300 --> 04:35.729
And because we rejected God--

04:35.979 --> 04:37.550
tacitly accepting Satan--

04:37.800 --> 04:40.600
we must suffer through the Apocalypse.

04:43.403 --> 04:46.650
I thought all religions
were a path to God.

04:46.900 --> 04:47.900
I  was wrong!

04:50.518 --> 04:53.368
Why did I put my faith in
science and technology?

04:56.053 --> 04:58.453
Why did I choose to be gay?

04:59.417 --> 05:00.506
This movie will haunt me

05:00.756 --> 05:04.306
for the rest of my life,
just like Cannonball Run II.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.429
Marge, what if the Rapture is coming

05:07.679 --> 05:09.050
and I haven't led a good enough life?

05:09.300 --> 05:11.753
I could be... left below!

05:12.003 --> 05:13.450
Sweetie, don't worry.

05:13.700 --> 05:16.568
God wouldn't spring the
Rapture on us unannounced.

05:16.818 --> 05:19.453
He'd send us signs, like, I don't know,

05:19.703 --> 05:22.567
all the dogs getting on a
spaceship and leaving.

05:22.817 --> 05:25.956
Yeah, I'll bet the cats
would be psyched about that.

05:26.606 --> 05:29.229
Thanks Marge, you've put my mind at ease.

05:29.479 --> 05:33.179
Now how about a little "rapture" for Mama?

05:34.300 --> 05:36.853
I could be the Rachel to your Jacob.

05:37.103 --> 05:40.303
Okay, but it's tough for me not
to think about their hardship.

05:43.200 --> 05:43.668
Marge is right--

05:43.918 --> 05:44.903
the Rapture isn't coming!

05:45.153 --> 05:47.203
There haven't been any ominous signs!

05:49.017 --> 05:51.167
Follow me!

05:56.156 --> 05:57.650
It's just not workin' out, Barry.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.159
Yeah. I guess I'd better study
for the police exam again.

06:00.409 --> 06:01.050
Good luck.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.200
You, too.

06:07.403 --> 06:09.253
Blood is raining from the sky!

06:12.100 --> 06:13.268
Hang on there, big fella!

06:13.518 --> 06:14.818
We'll save ya!

06:16.603 --> 06:17.467
This  ain't personal.

06:17.717 --> 06:19.917
I just love to scrimshaw.

06:23.906 --> 06:26.106
Judgment day is at hand.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.459
Can I help you?

06:32.709 --> 06:34.750
We're having a sale on
Bible magnifying glasses.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.603
Be... gat.

06:37.503 --> 06:38.850
Do you have any books on the Rapture?

06:39.100 --> 06:41.200
Yes, this one is 15% off.

06:43.318 --> 06:44.050
I'll take everything you've got.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.767
And would you like to take advantage of our

06:46.017 --> 06:47.306
Friends of Flanders" discount?

06:47.556 --> 06:48.956
No, thank you.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.200
Here's a pretty little wig for Lisa...

06:57.079 --> 06:59.650
And a handsome toupee for Bart!

06:59.900 --> 07:03.053
So, you still think I'm crazy for
saving all your hair trimmings?

07:03.303 --> 07:03.950
No, ma'am.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.068
Okay, then.

07:05.318 --> 07:08.118
Let's get the rest of this
hair back in the freezer.

07:10.617 --> 07:13.856
Homer, you didn't touch your second
dinner tonight, and you're reading books.

07:14.106 --> 07:15.069
Word books!

07:15.319 --> 07:16.850
What's going on?

07:17.100 --> 07:18.453
Marge, the Rapture is nigh.

07:18.703 --> 07:20.600
These books will help me
figure out how nigh.

07:20.850 --> 07:22.768
This whole deal is scientifically proven.

07:23.018 --> 07:25.203
The Book of Revelations has 404 verses...

07:25.451 --> 07:28.469
Add the number of people at the Last Supper...

07:28.710 --> 07:31.651
...minus the number of Filipinos in the Bible...

07:31.908 --> 07:32.625
And you get...

07:32.879 --> 07:34.553
Three million, one hundred and...

07:35.103 --> 07:38.050
3:15 p.m., May 18th!

07:38.300 --> 07:40.168
That's when the Rapture will begin!

07:40.418 --> 07:41.003
May 18th?

07:41.253 --> 07:42.617
That's one week from today.

07:43.117 --> 07:43.706
A week?

07:43.956 --> 07:45.106
That's...

07:46.100 --> 07:47.700
Seven days from now!

07:48.609 --> 07:50.250
The world will end next week!

07:50.500 --> 07:52.353
Spend your children's college fund!

07:52.603 --> 07:54.603
Thaw that turkey now!

07:54.900 --> 07:57.868
This is Kent Brockman reporting
live from downtown Springfield,

07:58.118 --> 08:00.803
where overweight doomsayer
Homer Simpson is predicting

08:01.053 --> 08:01.967
the world will end...

08:02.217 --> 08:03.156
next Wednesday!

08:03.406 --> 08:06.650
Homer, what turned you from
sad drunk to mad monk?

08:06.900 --> 08:07.979
Funny story, Kent...

08:08.229 --> 08:09.650
It's the end of the world!

08:09.900 --> 08:11.053
God loves you!

08:11.303 --> 08:13.203
He's gonna kill you!

08:14.900 --> 08:15.568
Here's my angle--

08:15.818 --> 08:17.203
there's no way in God's Heaven

08:17.453 --> 08:18.507
I should get into God's Heaven,

08:18.757 --> 08:21.506
but maybe He'll let me in,
if I warn others

08:21.756 --> 08:22.979
the Apocalypse is coming--

08:23.229 --> 08:24.650
as I previously shouted.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.253
I see. Well, we have 30 seconds left.

08:27.503 --> 08:29.150
Any other cuckoo yip-yap?

08:30.600 --> 08:31.068
Here's one.

08:31.318 --> 08:32.803
Revelations 6:13.

08:33.053 --> 08:36.567
Just before the Rapture,
"the stars will fall to the Earth."

08:36.817 --> 08:39.306
So all you hippies out there might want to...

08:39.556 --> 08:41.250
for that one.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.150
There you have it folks.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.869
And if I can make a prediction of my own.

08:44.119 --> 08:45.850
This weekend's Springfield Lettuce Festival

08:46.100 --> 08:47.453
is gonna be bigger and better than ever.

08:47.703 --> 08:49.450
We've got romaine, iceberg, radicchio,

08:49.700 --> 08:51.868
and everyone's favorite, baby Bibb.

08:52.118 --> 08:55.068
Even a few cabbages are getting in on the fun.

08:56.653 --> 08:58.667
Homie, I'm glad you're getting exercise.

08:58.917 --> 09:01.306
I just wish it wasn't crazy exercise.

09:01.556 --> 09:06.306
Marge, in a world gone mad,
only a lunatic is truly insane.

09:07.100 --> 09:11.629
Dad, we love you, but we just don't
think the world is coming to an end. Yet.

09:11.879 --> 09:13.150
A hundred years, global warming--

09:13.400 --> 09:14.553
we're goners, but for now,

09:14.803 --> 09:18.553
do you think you could lighten
up on this "left below" stuff?

09:20.800 --> 09:23.468
Well... I guess this thing
does look pretty silly.

09:23.718 --> 09:26.803
Let's all take off our sandwich
boards and watch TV.

09:26.953 --> 09:28.967
Live, from Springfield Stadium,

09:29.217 --> 09:33.806
it's Krusty the Clown's Celebrity
Salute to Specials!

09:34.056 --> 09:38.150
The crowd is abuzz and agog as
the celebrity blimp approaches.

09:38.400 --> 09:43.259
And  look! Here is America's favorite
waste of taxpayer dollars--

09:43.509 --> 09:44.809
the Blue Angels!

09:47.500 --> 09:49.453
What  the...? The Blue Angels?

09:49.703 --> 09:52.503
I thought we were getting Charlie's Angels.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.868
Oh, God! We're going down!

09:59.118 --> 10:01.768
I don't wanna die next to Kathy Griffin!

10:05.253 --> 10:08.153
The stars are falling to the Earth!

10:10.317 --> 10:12.267
Just as you predicted.

10:13.006 --> 10:14.259
Well, that's our show for tonight.

10:14.509 --> 10:18.350
I'd like to thank all the very
talented people who broke my fall.

10:18.600 --> 10:23.650
To all the fans of Los Lobos,
mucho, mucho condolences.

10:25.103 --> 10:26.653
Good night, everybody!

10:28.300 --> 10:29.568
Homer, you were right!

10:29.818 --> 10:32.053
That must mean you were right
about the Rapture, too.

10:32.303 --> 10:34.867
Yeah, I was wondering if you
could help save my soul.

10:35.117 --> 10:36.506
I've done stuff I ain't proud of,

10:36.756 --> 10:39.050
and  the stuff I am proud of is disgusting.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.829
What are we supposed to do on Wednesday?

10:41.079 --> 10:42.150
Lie naked on our roof?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.653
Cause that girl's school says
I can't do that no more.

10:44.903 --> 10:47.650
When the time comes,
we won't be in our homes,

10:47.900 --> 10:49.568
because we're all gonna go...

10:49.818 --> 10:51.168
here!

10:51.953 --> 10:53.267
That's Springfield Mesa.

10:53.517 --> 10:57.906
It's 15 miles north, past the
Warren Harding Memorial Through-hole!

10:58.156 --> 10:58.850
Exactly.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.129
It came to me in a vision...

11:00.379 --> 11:01.750
Or maybe it was a drunken haze...

11:02.000 --> 11:03.453
Or, possibly, an ice cream headache.

11:03.703 --> 11:07.650
Well, well, well, looks like
someone's having a pre-Rapture party.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.368
No, Flanders. It's...

11:09.618 --> 11:11.550
a meeting of gay witches for abortion.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.500
You wouldn't be interested.

11:16.417 --> 11:17.106
All right, everybody.

11:17.356 --> 11:20.950
Pair up with a Rapture buddy who will
watch your back through all eternity.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.929
Chief Wiggum, wanna be my buddy?

11:23.179 --> 11:24.050
What's wrong with Carl?

11:24.300 --> 11:26.000
Trouble in paradise?

11:26.703 --> 11:28.750
Dad, please don't go through with this.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.868
All through history,
self-anointed seers have predicted

11:32.118 --> 11:34.653
the end of the world,
and they've always been wrong.

11:34.903 --> 11:38.267
But sweetheart, I have something they didn't have--

11:38.517 --> 11:40.356
a good feeling about this.

11:40.506 --> 11:41.359
It's all right, Lisa.

11:41.609 --> 11:42.850
Don't go. More Heaven for me.

11:42.900 --> 11:43.953
Lisa's going!

11:44.203 --> 11:44.950
We're all going!

11:45.200 --> 11:45.968
Come on, Lisa.

11:46.218 --> 11:48.453
No one in this family is being left below.

11:48.703 --> 11:49.467
Wait for me!

11:49.717 --> 11:51.517
I'm a-comin'!

11:51.916 --> 11:52.450
Don't worry, Dad!

11:52.700 --> 11:54.059
There's a bus coming for you!

11:54.309 --> 11:55.650
Drive, drive!

11:55.900 --> 12:00.053
99 minutes until we're all
saved 99 minutes to go

12:00.303 --> 12:02.850
Unless it turns out that you're not devout

12:03.100 --> 12:06.568
Then you're gonna be left down below 98 minutes

12:06.818 --> 12:09.453
until we're all saved 98 minutes to go...

12:09.303 --> 12:11.053
Wait for me! Wait for me!

12:17.017 --> 12:18.206
Okay, guys. Get ready!

12:18.456 --> 12:20.556
We're just seconds away!

12:21.200 --> 12:21.959
You saved us, Homer.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.050
I can't wait.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.753
I'm gonna steal God's secrets and sell 'em to Satan!

12:26.003 --> 12:28.350
...six... five... four...

12:28.600 --> 12:31.068
I'm so proud of you, Homie!

12:31.318 --> 12:33.353
...two... one...

12:33.603 --> 12:36.103
Good-bye, stupid Earth!

12:39.517 --> 12:41.906
There appears to be some delay!

12:42.156 --> 12:43.650
My watch must be running fast.

12:43.900 --> 12:44.829
Wait for it...

12:45.079 --> 12:47.329
Wait for it... wait for it...

12:52.000 --> 12:54.250
Wait for it... wait for it...

13:05.000 --> 13:06.550
Life goes on!

13:10.318 --> 13:12.068
Please don't go! Please!

13:12.853 --> 13:13.667
Please?!

13:13.917 --> 13:15.359
I command you!

13:15.609 --> 13:17.859
Homie... I'd better start dinner.

13:20.103 --> 13:22.250
Lisa, you still believe in me, don't you?

13:22.500 --> 13:27.668
Dad, if you'll recall, I never believed
in you, not for one second.

13:28.218 --> 13:29.768
That's my girl.

13:35.003 --> 13:37.667
Hey, Nostra-dumbass, did the Rapture come?

13:37.917 --> 13:38.549
I can't recall.

13:39.099 --> 13:42.150
In fact I can recall,
and it didn't, and you suck.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.459
Hey, Fatwad!

13:43.709 --> 13:46.659
Here's another thing you didn't predict.

13:51.900 --> 13:52.853
Let's go to Moe's.

13:53.103 --> 13:54.853
We'll walk and punch.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.268
Moe, what happened to your eponymous tavern?

14:07.518 --> 14:08.773
Yeah, funny thing, that.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.867
You said the end was comin',

14:11.117 --> 14:13.806
so I sold the bar to some Japanese businessmen

14:14.056 --> 14:15.450
and gave the money to charity.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.459
Now them orphans got new skip ropes,

14:17.709 --> 14:19.450
and I end every day smelling like eel.

14:19.700 --> 14:20.780
Cats are all over me.

14:21.030 --> 14:21.650
Thank you, though.

14:21.900 --> 14:22.858
You did me a solid.

14:23.108 --> 14:25.553
Hey, there's that jerk who tried to save us!

14:25.803 --> 14:27.653
Nice Rapture, Einstein!

14:44.017 --> 14:46.267
Hey, you with the tempura, your arm broken?

14:46.456 --> 14:52.450
How can people be so heartless?

14:52.700 --> 14:58.400
How can people be so cruel?

14:58.879 --> 15:01.850
Ten, 11, 12, 13?

15:02.100 --> 15:03.153
12 Apostles!

15:03.403 --> 15:05.450
But Jesus was at the last supper, too!

15:05.700 --> 15:07.650
This changes everything.

15:11.618 --> 15:12.603
Multiply by seven...

15:12.853 --> 15:14.067
don't forget to carry the six,

15:14.317 --> 15:15.056
six, six...

15:15.006 --> 15:15.456
Wake up!

15:15.706 --> 15:17.359
The Rapture is coming in half an hour!

15:17.609 --> 15:18.450
There's no time to waste!

15:18.700 --> 15:19.753
Marge, grill a chicken!

15:20.003 --> 15:21.250
No, make sandwiches!

15:21.500 --> 15:23.268
And some Kettle Chips would be nice!

15:23.518 --> 15:25.968
Original, not barbecue!

15:29.753 --> 15:31.467
We've got school tomorrow.

15:31.717 --> 15:34.067
Yeah, school.

15:35.006 --> 15:35.650
Forget school!

15:35.900 --> 15:37.159
We have to get to the mesa!

15:37.409 --> 15:39.650
We're not going anywhere, except to bed!

15:39.900 --> 15:40.853
But my prediction says...

15:41.103 --> 15:43.650
You couldn't predict 6:00 at 5:30!

15:43.900 --> 15:45.550
Now good night!

15:58.118 --> 15:59.105
Stupid family.

15:59.355 --> 16:00.767
Won't even come to my Rapture.

16:01.017 --> 16:07.117
I went to Lisa's school play,
which had serious pacing problems.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.806
Three... two... one.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.259
I'm wrong again!

16:17.509 --> 16:19.409
I'm nothing but a big, fat...

16:21.000 --> 16:22.453
I was right!

16:22.703 --> 16:24.250
And there's the Earth.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.450
So beautiful with your many rings.

16:36.668 --> 16:37.603
Homer Simpson!

16:37.853 --> 16:38.767
Welcome to Heaven.

16:39.017 --> 16:40.806
Now let's get you some clothes?

16:41.056 --> 16:42.050
I'm comfortable like this.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.259
Yeah, well this is Heaven...

16:43.509 --> 16:44.500
for everyone.

16:44.601 --> 16:47.053
This is our nature walk,
our pedicure hut,

16:47.303 --> 16:50.650
our state-of-the-art showroom,
tonight featuring Los Lobos.

16:50.900 --> 16:53.768
And over there is our water slide,
that's coming next year.

16:54.018 --> 16:55.203
It's gonna be super fantastic.

16:55.453 --> 16:56.467
How come it's not open yet?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.506
Look, just don't use leprechaun labor.

16:59.756 --> 17:00.529
Okay? Don't do it.

17:00.779 --> 17:02.829
And the best part of Heaven is:

17:03.079 --> 17:07.579
anything you wish for you get lickity split!

17:13.900 --> 17:16.153
Okay, just for that, your room's
next to the kiddie pool,

17:16.403 --> 17:19.353
all right, Mr. Smarty-Head Exploder?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.268
So if you need further assistance,
just call the front desk

17:22.518 --> 17:24.268
and ask for Andre, okay?

17:27.663 --> 17:28.467
Oh, sorry.

17:28.717 --> 17:30.506
I'd tip you, but I don't have any cash.

17:30.756 --> 17:31.950
You know you could wish for some.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.850
I could.

17:35.079 --> 17:36.950
Wait. Before you go,
there's one thing I gotta know.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.650
What happened to my family?

17:41.503 --> 17:43.850
Heaven has a wide array of fine dining

17:44.100 --> 17:45.668
just steps from your room.

17:45.918 --> 17:47.903
Have a light bite at the
Pope of Sandwich Village.

17:48.153 --> 17:49.067
Okay, let's see...

17:49.317 --> 17:51.817
Earth is Channel 23, I think.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.259
Why didn't we listen to Dad?!

18:03.509 --> 18:06.950
The worst part is I'll
never see my Homie again!

18:07.200 --> 18:08.253
That's the worst part?

18:08.503 --> 18:10.853
Then I'm not doing my job.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.000
I've gotta save them!

18:25.718 --> 18:27.203
Homer, what's wrong?

18:27.453 --> 18:30.567
Lord, you got a first-class-destination
resort here.

18:30.817 --> 18:31.506
Really topnotch.

18:31.756 --> 18:34.850
But I can't enjoy myself knowing
my family is suffering.

18:34.900 --> 18:37.659
Don't tell me about family suffering.

18:37.909 --> 18:40.050
My Son went down to Earth once.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.453
I don't know what you people did to Him,

18:42.703 --> 18:44.853
but He hasn't been the same since.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.268
He'll be fine.

18:49.518 --> 18:51.103
And You could still spare my family by...

18:51.353 --> 18:52.267
Pass.

18:52.517 --> 18:56.467
Buddy, You just made Yourself a powerful enemy.

19:07.856 --> 19:09.629
Hey, what's the big idea, pally?

19:09.879 --> 19:10.650
Why so crabby?

19:10.900 --> 19:11.653
Screw you, Dino!

19:11.903 --> 19:14.153
You squandered your gift!

19:21.300 --> 19:22.468
Squandered my gift?

19:22.718 --> 19:24.668
I  made 68 albums.

19:31.553 --> 19:32.767
I'm sorry, but Heaven isn't Heaven

19:33.017 --> 19:35.117
without my family in it.

19:35.656 --> 19:37.350
What do you want, Homer?

19:37.600 --> 19:39.829
Just send me back to Earth,
and put off this whole

19:40.079 --> 19:42.850
Rapture hoop-de-do for
another couple of years or so.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.053
But it's already started.

19:44.303 --> 19:45.250
To do what you're asking,

19:45.500 --> 19:47.368
I'd have to turn back time.

19:47.618 --> 19:48.803
Superman did it.

19:49.053 --> 19:50.867
Fine, Mr. Smarty-pants.

19:51.117 --> 19:53.306
I will undo the Apocalypse.

19:53.556 --> 19:54.756
Thanks.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.029
Listen, could you do me one more favor?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.750
You want me to help you with your alcoholism?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.853
No, I'm in a good place with that.

20:02.103 --> 20:04.050
Why don't you just take these pamphlets?

20:04.300 --> 20:06.368
Yeah, I'll definitely read those later.

20:06.618 --> 20:10.118
Now, listen, if you could
just see your way clear to...

20:12.303 --> 20:13.553
Very well.

20:15.117 --> 20:17.017
Deus ex machina!

20:22.956 --> 20:25.150
It was all just a dream.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.359
What are these wings?

20:27.609 --> 20:30.759
It's just a seagull stuck in my back.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.453
Dad, we've been so worried about you!

20:33.703 --> 20:37.300
The Warren Harding Through-Hole
never seemed so long.

20:37.550 --> 20:40.168
Yeah, I missed you guys, too.

20:40.418 --> 20:41.803
Now if you'll excuse me...

20:42.053 --> 20:43.867
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

20:44.117 --> 20:46.606
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

20:46.556 --> 20:48.259
Thank you, Lord!

20:48.509 --> 20:50.409
It's back the way it was.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.553
Tthis is heaven.

20:54.803 --> 20:57.853
Hallelujah!
