the bomb contained naphtha.

Well, he’s an exterminator.
By definition, he hurts flies.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.216
That’s not
what she meant, Bones.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.267
Holden is a good boy.

21:53.354 --> 21:56.312
We have dinner together
almost every night.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.355
It’s just the two of us,
you understand.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.401
- Any friends?
- He’s very shy.

22:01.488 --> 22:04.230
He’s much happier working on
his projects in the garage.

22:05.366 --> 22:08.654
- What kind of projects?
- I don’t really know.

22:08.745 --> 22:11.862
- I like to give him his privacy.
- He have any financial troubles?

22:11.956 --> 22:14.072
Everybody does.

22:14.167 --> 22:17.034
He tried to get a loan, but
the bank wouldn’t give him one.

22:17.128 --> 22:20.416
Well, that must’ve
made him very angry.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.919
Well, he isn’t perfect.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.045
But I know my son.

22:25.136 --> 22:30.802
And if there has been
any kind of trouble,
it is not his fault.

22:30.892 --> 22:33.804
Just let me talk to him.
He’ll tell you.
I know he will.

22:35.605 --> 22:38.267
Um, I’m afraid that’s not
gonna be possible.

22:48.952 --> 22:50.408
Please.

22:50.495 --> 22:54.454
You just tell me
what’s happened to my son.

23:02.882 --> 23:06.215
These just came through
from the hospital.

23:06.302 --> 23:09.339
Pre-op photos of the cab driver,
and his X-rays.

23:09.430 --> 23:13.594
[ Brennan ] Severe trauma,
primarily to the proximal
phalanges and metacarpals.

23:13.685 --> 23:17.348
Pitting and multiple fractures
to the palmar side.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.895
He was probably trying to shield
his face from the explosion.

23:20.024 --> 23:23.812
We think the fragment
in his zygomatic arch may be
the missing manubrium fragment.

23:23.903 --> 23:27.646
There. Did the hospital deliver
the bone shrapnel fragments .7

23:27.740 --> 23:31.028
Ms. Wick’s working on it now.
We’re hoping they’ll give us
a better sense of the bomb.

23:31.119 --> 23:34.282
We need Angela
to re-create the explosion.

23:34.372 --> 23:36.988
As soon as Hodgins
figures out the bomb.

23:42.505 --> 23:46.089
It’s very difficult to work
when someone is looking
over your shoulder.

23:46.175 --> 23:49.838
It’s even more difficult to work
when you have nothing
to work on.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.840
Snap it up.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.515
This is it.
The missing manubrium.

23:55.602 --> 23:59.436
Three parallel burns,
about two millimeters apart.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.935
Ooh, I think we got
our initiator.

24:03.026 --> 24:06.063
The bomb maker used the base
of a small lightbulb.

24:06.154 --> 24:08.440
Battery on one end,
explosives on the other.

24:08.531 --> 24:11.489
I’m gonna run this through
the EXIS database.

24:11.576 --> 24:13.692
Oh, one more thing.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.493
I found this
in Santa’s 12th rib.

24:16.581 --> 24:18.492
I’m never gonna
make my flight.

24:18.583 --> 24:21.996
- I recommend
celebrating in March.
- Thank you, Ebenezer.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.925
You’re not going to
El Salvador for Christmas .7

24:31.012 --> 24:32.468
Mm-hmm.

24:32.555 --> 24:36.013
You don’t strike me as
someone who’s flexible
about their schedule.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.842
Well, I took advice
from someone who knows
more about families than I do.

24:38.936 --> 24:41.473
“He that raises
a large family...

24:41.564 --> 24:44.146
“does stand a broader mark
for sorrow;

24:44.233 --> 24:46.315
- “but then stands
a broader mark—
- [Knocking 0n Door]

24:46.402 --> 24:48.017
for pleasure as well.”

24:48.112 --> 24:52.196
Well, that’s sort of what he said,
but without the pleasure part.

24:52.283 --> 24:54.365
- Booth.
- Yeah.
So, the explosives unit...

24:54.452 --> 24:56.989
checked out
Holden Chevaleer’s garage—
there was nothing.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.948
- And this guy’s name doesn’t
even pop up in the system.
- That’s very interesting, but—

25:01.042 --> 25:04.705
Which just conﬁrms that
we have to find his accomplice.
Nice tree.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.753
Oh, wow.
Who is this, your sister?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.751
No, um, my second cousin.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.093
I’m Margaret.

25:11.219 --> 25:13.801
There’s no resemblance.
What do you mean?

25:13.888 --> 25:15.674
You’re both very beautiful.

25:15.765 --> 25:18.802
“Beauty and folly
are old companions.”

25:18.935 --> 25:21.597
Told you.
Benjamin Franklin.
Right. Right.

25:21.688 --> 25:25.556
Hey, hey. Good old Ben. You
know, he invented electricity
and the hundred-dollar bill.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.766
Neither one of
those things is true.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.522
You’re right.
There’s no resemblance
whatsoever.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.979
Nice meeting you, Maggie.
[ Clears Throat]

25:33.074 --> 25:34.735
[ Sniffs ]
Bye, Booth.

25:34.826 --> 25:35.941
See ya.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.916
Uh, that’s my partner.
He’s F.B.l.

25:46.003 --> 25:49.962
His eyes are too small
to be really handsome.

25:50.049 --> 25:55.794
Well, I have to admit,
I find him pleasing to look at.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.145
- Agent Booth.
- I’m busy.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.019
Look, what you were saying
about my broadcast
blowing that guy up—

26:09.152 --> 26:12.360
l was hoping you could put me
in contact with his mother.
Stay away from her.

26:12.447 --> 26:16.065
It was a coincidence.
No way I could’ve known
in a million years, but still.

26:16.159 --> 26:19.367
If you don’t feel responsible,
then why do you want to talk
to this victim’s mother?

26:21.539 --> 26:23.825
Hey, I was army, man,
just like you.

26:23.958 --> 26:26.791
lserved my country.
You don’t even remember
what this country stands for.

26:26.878 --> 26:29.369
- Maybe it’s you who forgot.
- Sorry?

26:29.464 --> 26:32.001
- Freedom of speech.
l have the right to be heard.
- Legally, yeah.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.628
Maybe you should think about
saying something worth hearing.

26:34.719 --> 26:37.756
- Look, it— it wasn’t my fault.
- You spew that poison out
in the airways.

26:37.847 --> 26:40.839
This happened. You know it.
Agent, show him out.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.844
Sir.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.854
Let’s go.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.431
[Computer Beeping ]

26:49.525 --> 26:52.392
We ran the details of the bomb
against the EXIS database.

26:52.487 --> 26:55.820
It’s an identical match
for a number of devices
all built by the same man.

26:55.907 --> 26:57.613
A guy named Malaki Wallace.

26:57.700 --> 27:00.442
[ Saroyan ]
He got busted in the ’905 for
robbing a Western Union office.

27:00.536 --> 27:03.494
And using an emulsion bomb
with a lightbulb initiator.

27:03.581 --> 27:06.869
- Okay. Anything more current?
- No. He’s been dormant
since he got out of prison.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.372
- Prison?
- Yep. And it looks like
he came back with a bang.

27:14.967 --> 27:18.004
You’re not listening.
I’ve been out of
the bombing game for years.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.346
- Really?
- Really.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.341
Yeah. So how do you
explain this?

27:21.432 --> 27:24.265
Well, I’m always happy
to consult.

27:24.352 --> 27:28.891
That is a simple
incendiary device.
Very rudimentary.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.437
Right.

27:33.236 --> 27:36.228
Whoa!
Was that strictly necessary?

27:36.322 --> 27:40.361
See, explosives unit—
the y found that in
your apartment there, Malaki.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.066
So, I’m a fidgeter.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.824
Bomb making is
a compulsive activity,
much like arson.

27:45.915 --> 27:48.748
Problem is,
just about anything will
ﬁdget itself into a bomb,

27:48.835 --> 27:52.498
given half a chance
and readily available
household products.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.840
Oh, like something like this?

27:54.924 --> 27:56.004
No. Okay. Okay.

27:56.092 --> 27:58.299
- What is that, Booth?
- No. What do you want?

27:58.386 --> 28:02.004
Where you been
for the past 48 hours?

28:02.098 --> 28:03.804
- Pushing plungers.
- Demolition?

I’m an apartment super.

The tenants all had
to share one porta-potty.

28:13.568 --> 28:17.527
It’s not that easy, pal.
You see, we have a device
with your name written all over it.

28:17.613 --> 28:21.151

the whole deal, pal.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.699

You know, maybe you, uh—
you have a protege.

28:27.415 --> 28:29.155
Someone you passed
the torch to?

28:29.250 --> 28:31.707
Well, if someone built
one of my devices,

28:31.794 --> 28:34.456
they probably just got
the recipe off my Web site.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.458
You have a mad-bomber Web site?

28:36.549 --> 28:39.256

Uh, I got fans.

And these fans,
they— they subscribe?

28:41.637 --> 28:44.720
E-mails and passwords
and correspondence.
You name it.

28:44.807 --> 28:47.514
Right.

28:49.437 --> 28:52.725
I found this in the area
of the right articular capsule.

28:52.815 --> 28:56.228
It’s a puncture mark,
like you would get
from a deep needle jab.

28:56.319 --> 28:59.186
Well, perhaps it’s where
the bomber injected himself
with propranolol.

28:59.322 --> 29:03.440
Although it’s unlikely
someone would inject themselves
deep enough to strike bone.

29:03.534 --> 29:07.072
Exactly. So, I reviewed
the X-rays...

29:07.163 --> 29:09.779
of the right scapula
and hand.

29:09.874 --> 29:12.286
Look at the extensor facet
of the glenoid cavity...

29:12.376 --> 29:14.958
and the bilateral asymmetry
of the second metacarpal.

29:15.046 --> 29:17.753
Indicative of pronounced
right-handedness.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.502
He couldn’t have
injected himself
in the right arm.

29:20.593 --> 29:25.337
Dr. B.
l l. D. ’d the fragment of wire
we got out of his r/b.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.968
Booth’s gonna wanna hear this.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.934
So someone else injected Santa
with the propranolol.
[ Brennan ] Evidently.

29:32.021 --> 29:36.105
And the wire in his rib
was triple heat-treated
boron-manganese steel.

29:36.192 --> 29:39.776
Is that what they used
to wire the tubes
of the explosives together?

29:39.862 --> 29:41.773
No. It’s a patented
form of steel...

29:41.864 --> 29:43.650
used exclusively
in high-end bike locks.

29:43.741 --> 29:45.231
It wasn’t part of the bomb.

29:45.326 --> 29:48.659
It was what locked
Holden Chevaleer
into the bomb.

29:48.746 --> 29:50.862
Someone locked him
into the vest,

29:50.957 --> 29:54.415
dressed him like Santa,
and then forced him
to rob the bank.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.493
Wait a sec. Patsy.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.703
That’s why he said
what he said.

29:58.798 --> 30:00.629
“I just answered the call.”

30:00.716 --> 30:03.048
The guy’s
an exterminator, Bones.

30:03.135 --> 30:07.378
- He meant “the call” literally.
- [ Sighs ]
He answered a service call.

30:07.473 --> 30:11.307
Only his customer
locked him into a bomb
and made him rob a bank.

30:11.394 --> 30:13.885
- This is not good.
- Why?

30:13.980 --> 30:17.472
Why? Because whoever
strapped Holden into the bomb
dio’n ’t get what they wanted

30:17.566 --> 30:20.694
What if they try again?

30:24.740 --> 30:27.322
Oh, you look peeved.
I went to wash my hands
just now,

30:27.410 --> 30:29.321
but there was no soap
in the dispenser.

30:29.412 --> 30:32.074
It had to be—

30:32.164 --> 30:34.701

Hey. Uh, you look irked.

30:37.878 --> 30:40.665
Uh—
She’s mad about the soap.

30:40.756 --> 30:44.590
Your analysis of
the emulsion bomb
included detergent.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.293
You didn’t actually
get permission to re-create
the bomb, did you?

30:47.388 --> 30:49.128
Oh, my God.

30:49.223 --> 30:52.386
- I needed to do this so Angela
could re-create the explosion.
- You told him that?

30:52.476 --> 30:54.341
Don’t let him
turn this around on me.

30:54.437 --> 30:57.019
I do not want
an explosive device in my lab.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.971
Relax. I did not connect
the initiator.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.602
No!

31:00.693 --> 31:02.684
It is perfectly safe.

31:04.321 --> 31:07.563
- What’s that?
- It’s antimony sulfide.

31:07.658 --> 31:09.694
It’s fine on its own.
It’s perfectly harmless.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.776
The bomber used it
in the detonating charge.

31:11.871 --> 31:15.238
Hodgins is very authentic when
it comes to his reconstructions.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.414
We have to pull
the evidence trays.

31:19.712 --> 31:22.579
Give me a clue here, guys.
What are we looking for?

31:22.673 --> 31:24.413
It’s H1-1209.

31:24.508 --> 31:26.999
Biological evidence
from witness Georgia Hartmeyer.

31:27.094 --> 31:29.471
Oh, got it.
It’s her fingernail.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.931
/ thought it was
jUst blast residue.

31:35.019 --> 31:38.477
But that stain’s
definitely on the inside.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.899
- Did you have to do that?
- It’s metallic and sweet.

31:43.986 --> 31:45.897
That is definitely
antimony sulfide.

31:45.988 --> 31:49.480
It couldn’t have gotten there
unless she helped
assemble the bomb.

31:52.036 --> 31:54.027
[Door Opens ]

31:54.121 --> 31:57.488
Okay, Ms. Hartmeyer.
We just have a couple
follow-up questions. That’s all.

31:57.583 --> 32:01.371
Like, what were you doing
outside the bank, for instance?

32:01.462 --> 32:04.078
I told you—
waiting for the bus.

32:04.173 --> 32:07.415
I checked. You live on
the other side of town.

32:07.510 --> 32:09.501
I take the bus to work.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.052
You were fired
three months ago.

32:12.139 --> 32:13.720
I like to shop in that area.
Okay?

32:13.808 --> 32:17.221
That is very interesting,
because we checked
your credit cards,

32:17.311 --> 32:20.974
and you’ve never made
a purchase anywhere near
Capital Mutual Bank.

32:21.065 --> 32:22.680
Gotcha.

32:22.775 --> 32:25.232
You got nothin’.

32:25.319 --> 32:27.401
I didn’t blow him up.

32:27.488 --> 32:29.695
I swear I didn’t blow him up.

32:35.579 --> 32:39.163
So I re-created the scene
outside the bank.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.957
Oh, that’s Booth,
with the “Cocky” belt.

32:42.044 --> 32:45.628
Yeah, and this is the cab driver.
And Georgia Hartmeyer.

32:45.714 --> 32:49.423
Now, | factored in everything
we know about the bomb’s
velocity and direction,

32:49.510 --> 32:54.220
including the posh‘ions of
Booth, Georgia and the cab
driver prior to the blast.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.092
Okay. Here we go.

33:02.231 --> 33:06.224
- See the problem?
- The cab driver covered
his face with his hands.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.560
We know that from his injuries.
But given his proximity,

33:09.697 --> 33:11.779
he wouldn’t have
had the t/me.
Yeah.

33:11.866 --> 33:14.733
Now, I can adjust
his reaction times, but...

33:14.827 --> 33:20.367
even when | go superhuman—
and I’m talking, like, Maverick
and Iceman reaction times—

33:20.457 --> 33:22.539
look at where
the bone shrapnel lands.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.338
The only explanation is
that he was reacting
not to the explosion,

33:29.425 --> 33:30.881
but to the sound of the radio.

33:30.968 --> 33:36.634
Yeah.
Now check out the F.C.C.’s
frequency allocation chart.

33:36.724 --> 33:41.343
Now Owen Thiel broadcasts
his pirate radio signal
at 27.4 megahertz,

33:41.437 --> 33:45.021
which is right next
to 27.41 megahertz,

33:45.107 --> 33:48.270
which is
the land mobile frequency
this cab driver used

33:48.360 --> 33:50.442
So Georgia
and the cab driver...

33:50.529 --> 33:53.236
must have locked Holden
into the bomb vest.

33:53.324 --> 33:55.235
They waited
outside of the bank.

33:55.326 --> 34:00.491
If Holden didn’t do what they
asked, the cab driver could
detonate him with the cab radio.

34:00.581 --> 34:03.414
Yeah. Only Owen Thiel
beat him to it.

34:04.627 --> 34:06.993
I’ll have Booth look for
the cab driver’s name...

- Well, uh, the time
you made those jokes,

you weren’t aware
that Holden was a patsy.

we forget those bones out there

34:32.363 --> 34:33.978
the second I got ’em
into interrogation.

34:34.114 --> 34:38.403
Apparently they found each other
at a debt-counseling seminar,
of all things.

34:38.494 --> 34:40.530
- How did they pick Holden?
- Ah, the phone book.

34:40.621 --> 34:43.909
They called. And as soon
as he showed up,
theyjumped him.

34:43.999 --> 34:48.083

what they wanted,
they would set him free.

34:51.382 --> 34:53.464

34:53.550 --> 34:56.792
Cam says that the victim’s mother
is burying him on Christmas morning.

34:56.929 --> 35:00.262

It’sjust him
and his mom, right?

35:27.167 --> 35:29.749
You know, when I say
heartbreaking,

35:29.837 --> 35:34.046
you say that the heart
is a muscle, so it—
it can’t break.

35:34.133 --> 35:36.340
It can only get crushed.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.544

- You wanna go to his funeral?
- Yes.

35:46.562 --> 35:50.726

Then... she won’t be alone.

your heart muscle is...
