We haven't really gotten out much

Nothing to be concerned about.

Okay, then be honest with me.
Why did you bring magic here?

05:38.047 --> 05:40.413
I've told you. Magic is power.

Tell me.

You don't need power, Rumple.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.927
You need courage. To let me in.

-Huh?

07:13.976 --> 07:15.932

07:16.020 --> 07:17.510
Please let her go.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.892
I'm not much for bartering.

That said, I do consider myself
an honorable man.

Mary Margaret and my mom back.

from your daughter.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.449
Is this some kind of cruel joke?

09:45.961 --> 09:48.668
Would I have made this flyer
if I knew where she was?

09:48.839 --> 09:53.003
The only reason she's missing is
because of the deal I made with you.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.668
If I'd held out hope she might have
survived such a wicked trade.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.469
And she has.

Why hasn't she come looking for me?

You better hope I agree
it's worth my time.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.271
I've heard you've been looking for
something, and as luck would have it,

10:49.358 --> 10:52.350
I'm a man who trades
in hard-to-find objects.

pay the highest price for said treasures.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.258
And what rumors could they be?

11:22.474 --> 11:24.635
That you were once a great coward,

11:24.768 --> 11:26.633
but that you became the Dark One
to overcome that

11:26.770 --> 11:28.886

who you lost despite all...

What about youth?

That's your third iced tea this morning.

Well, I've... I've been a kept woman.
Until recently.

13:09.373 --> 13:11.238
Let me guess. Bad breakup?

13:12.084 --> 13:14.746
I think I may be headed there.

13:14.878 --> 13:17.620
Do you have a place to stay?
Any family here?

13:17.714 --> 13:21.502
I'm not sure. I'm still looking.
But I'm on my own for now.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.549
I could ask Granny about a room here.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.501
(COINS CLINK)

15:18.794 --> 15:21.080
What's your name, crocodile?

15:21.171 --> 15:22.160
(LAUGHTER CONTIN U ES)

15:24.049 --> 15:25.038
(GIGGLES)

15:30.680 --> 15:33.012
You. I remember you.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.636
Always nice to make an impression.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.930
(COIN CLATTERS)

15:38.021 --> 15:40.387
Where are my manners?
We haven't been properly introduced.

15:41.191 --> 15:44.228
Rumplestiltskin. Or, as others know me,

15:45.195 --> 15:46.685
the Dark One.

15:49.241 --> 15:50.230
Oh!

15:50.992 --> 15:53.028
| see my reputation precedes me.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.197
-It does.
-Good.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.074
That's gonna save us time

15:57.207 --> 16:00.540
during the question and answer portion
of our game.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.539
What is it you want to know?

16:04.881 --> 16:07.042
How's Milah, of course?

16:08.552 --> 16:09.541
Who?

16:10.512 --> 16:11.718
(GIGGLES)

16:12.180 --> 16:15.092
Only too happy to dig out the memory.

16:16.393 --> 16:19.885
But it gets really messy.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.351
She's dead.

16:26.862 --> 16:27.942
Died a long time ago.

16:29.573 --> 16:30.858
What is it you want?

16:32.909 --> 16:35.241
We didn't get a chance
to finish our duel.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.492
Not now. Tomorrow at dawn.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.040
I'm not a cruel man,
get your affairs in order.

16:42.127 --> 16:47.087
Also, you can spend tonight knowing
it'll be your last.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.884
(GIGGLES) Maybe I am cruel.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.923
And don't think about trying to escape.

16:54.306 --> 16:56.968
Because I will find you

16:57.100 --> 17:00.934
and I will gut your entire crew...
(ITALIAN ACCENT) Like the fish.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.099
May l have a word?

17:08.820 --> 17:09.900
Shedﬁ?

17:09.988 --> 17:11.103
Acting Sheriff.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.948
And I'm already late on another busy
day cleaning up the mess you made.

17:15.118 --> 17:18.736
My apologies. That was a moment
of poorjudgment on my part.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.453
And it's not lost on me
that I'm now here to ask for your help.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.917
Well, then it shouldn't be lost on you
when I say no.

17:26.004 --> 17:29.087
Hear me out, first.
I'm here to report a missing person.

17:31.426 --> 17:32.541
(SIGHS)

17:32.969 --> 17:36.302
She left my home early this morning.
Her name is Belle.

17:37.641 --> 17:39.973
Back in our land, you mentioned
you loved someone once. ls...

17:40.060 --> 17:41.140
Yes.

17:42.312 --> 17:44.769
You also said she died.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.104
I thought she had.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.317
Well, why don't you just use the tracking
spell you gave me to find Jefferson?

17:50.445 --> 17:53.653
It only works if you have something
the person owned. I don't.

17:53.782 --> 17:56.615
How can you be sure
she's gone missing and not run away?

17:56.785 --> 17:57.900
I can't.

17:58.662 --> 18:03.577
Look, the townsfolk are less
than sympathetic to my plight. But you?

18:04.292 --> 18:05.907
You're in the rather unique position

18:06.002 --> 18:08.163
to understand exactly
what I'm going through.

18:11.633 --> 18:12.964
Will you help me?

18:28.942 --> 18:31.684
Pick it up, dearie, and let's begin.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.821
There's no need.

18:36.700 --> 18:41.615
Sorry. But killing a man with his own
sword was just too delicious to pass up.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.199
Hmm?

18:50.005 --> 18:51.040
(YELLS)

18:55.677 --> 18:56.666
(GRUNTS)

18:57.220 --> 19:00.963
Ships that pass in the night.
Well, at least one ship.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.213
(GRUNTING)

19:14.362 --> 19:15.351
(YELLS)

19:16.072 --> 19:17.061
(GRUNTS)

19:31.087 --> 19:33.499
Go on. I'm ready for the sword.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.166
No.

19:40.013 --> 19:44.427
Do you know what it's like to have
your wife stolen from you?

19:44.601 --> 19:47.092
To feel powerless to stop it?

19:47.771 --> 19:50.729
It feels like having your heart ripped
from your chest.

19:51.775 --> 19:54.517
Actually, let me show you!

19:54.778 --> 19:55.767
(GRUNTS)

19:56.279 --> 19:57.268
(SQUISHES)

19:58.281 --> 19:59.270
WOMAN: Stop!

20:06.081 --> 20:07.446
Milah?

20:11.711 --> 20:14.293
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

20:14.631 --> 20:16.872
I'm just a man who procures
hard-to-find objects.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.208
In this case, the object was you.

20:20.637 --> 20:22.468
So then, who put you up to this?

20:24.891 --> 20:26.097
Belle?

20:27.560 --> 20:28.549
(GASPS)

20:28.770 --> 20:29.759
Oh.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.015
Oh. How I've missed you, Belle.

20:32.107 --> 20:33.222
(CRYING) Father.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.807
I'm so sorry this is how
we had to be reunited.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.977
Please understand, I had no choice.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.736
But to kidnap me?

20:40.824 --> 20:43.486
After the curse broke,
I searched all over for you

20:43.618 --> 20:45.950
and discovered the Dark One
still had you captive.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.824
He wasn't holding me captive.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.786
I chose to be with him.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.328
Are you saying you fell in love with him?

20:58.466 --> 20:59.967
But I fear it may be over now.

21:00.135 --> 21:03.343
It must be.
Promise me you no longer love him.

21:03.471 --> 21:04.677
That you will never see him again!

21:04.806 --> 21:06.842
I'm not... I'm not a child!

21:06.975 --> 21:10.467
You don't understand what that man
will do to you! What he's already done!

21:10.603 --> 21:14.596
No, you don't understand! It's my life.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.479
Then I don't have a choice.

21:19.529 --> 21:20.518
I'm sorry.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.898
Do it.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.609
But, Father! Father, what...
What are you doing? What? Stop!

21:27.871 --> 21:29.452
-Goodbye, Belle. I love you.
-Father!

21:31.291 --> 21:32.531
Yeah, that's him all right.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.882
Do you remember
turning a butcher into a pig?

21:43.970 --> 21:45.301
Can't say that I do. Why?

21:45.388 --> 21:48.300
Well, he does.
Apparently it was his father.

21:48.391 --> 21:51.303
I'm beginning to understand
why nobody wants to help you.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.055
(STAMMERS) Well, what...
Has he seen Belle?

21:53.229 --> 21:54.810
Afraid not.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.222
-Okay, so what's next?
-Granny's.

21:57.358 --> 22:00.225
We can see
who else you terrorized there.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.401
Look,uh,

22:03.698 --> 22:05.063
can I ask you a question?

22:05.492 --> 22:07.323
About you and Mary Margaret.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.071
(STAMMERS) How. ..

22:10.413 --> 22:12.654
How does that work?

22:14.542 --> 22:15.998
Are you asking dating advice?

22:18.379 --> 22:20.244
Of course not, no.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.509
(SIGHS)

22:24.093 --> 22:25.674
Honesty.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.336
That's how we did it.

22:28.431 --> 22:31.764
Hard work and being honest
with one another.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.934
Well, I don't lie.

22:35.104 --> 22:39.017
There's a difference between
literal truth and honesty of the heart.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.275
Nothing taught me that
more than this curse.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.696
(GRUNTING)

22:47.075 --> 22:48.531
-Milah!
-(GROANS)

22:50.370 --> 22:51.450
How?

22:51.538 --> 22:52.527
Milah, you have to run.

22:52.622 --> 22:54.783
No. I'm not leaving without you.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.289
Oh, how sweet.

22:56.417 --> 22:59.250
It appears there's
more to this tale than I know.

22:59.379 --> 23:00.414
Tell it to me, Milah!

23:00.547 --> 23:02.083
Please don't hurt him! I can explain!

23:02.298 --> 23:04.710
Tick-tock, dearie, tick-tock.

23:05.385 --> 23:10.049
That first night, when Killian
and his crew came into the tavern,

23:10.139 --> 23:13.222
he told stories
about the places he'd been.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.926
And I fell in love with him.

23:16.104 --> 23:18.470
-(GROAN|NG) Ah!
-I didn't mean for it to turn out this way.

23:19.941 --> 23:22.648
I didn't know how to tell you the truth.
I'm sorry.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.896
And so here we are.

23:27.991 --> 23:32.405
You've come to save the life
of your true love, the pirate.

23:32.579 --> 23:36.322
I didn't realize the power
of true love before.

23:36.457 --> 23:39.449
-It is impressive. I'd hate to break it up.
-(GROAN|NG)

23:39.627 --> 23:42.744
Actually, no. I'd love to.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.295
-Wait.
-(GROAN|NG LOUDER)

23:44.591 --> 23:46.798
l have something you want.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.838
Well, | find that very difficult to believe.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.513
Where did you get that?

23:55.351 --> 23:58.138
You know who I took it from.

23:58.605 --> 24:03.144
I may not know what
the Dark One wants with a magic bean.

24:03.359 --> 24:04.519
But I have it.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.859
| feel a proposal coming on.

24:07.030 --> 24:09.692
The magic bean
in exchange for our lives.

24:10.700 --> 24:11.860
Deal?

24:19.208 --> 24:22.826
I want to see it first.

24:23.630 --> 24:24.836
"Belle," huh?

24:26.049 --> 24:28.961
Sorry. Doesn't ring a bell.

24:30.470 --> 24:31.550
Ruby, listen to me,

24:31.721 --> 24:33.507
if you've come across her,
you've got to tell me.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.971
I'll make sure nothing bad happens.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.138
Yeah, but what about him?

24:36.225 --> 24:38.841
I've got him. Trust me.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.813
She was in earlier.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.485
She was looking for a job.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.605
I pointed her in the direction
of the library.

24:48.696 --> 24:49.902
Well, do you think she went there?

24:49.989 --> 24:51.490
Don't know.

24:52.909 --> 24:56.902
But when you find her, give her this.
She left it in her booth.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.195
That's mine.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.578
She didn't have anything for the cold.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.381
You sure you'll watch out for her?

25:08.007 --> 25:09.918
Yes. Why?

25:10.843 --> 25:12.424
I think...

25:13.388 --> 25:15.094
I think I can find her.

25:15.723 --> 25:17.429
Lately, since things changed,

25:17.600 --> 25:21.388
I've been, uh,
a little more sensitive to odors.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.768
What, you can smell her?

25:26.943 --> 25:29.901
I guess it's 'cause of the wolf thing.

25:40.289 --> 25:41.369
What's wrong?

25:41.457 --> 25:44.574
I had her but I lost her trail.

25:44.669 --> 25:45.658
(SNEEZES)

25:46.212 --> 25:47.201
(INHALES DEEPLY) Oh.

25:47.296 --> 25:48.752
It must be the flowers.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.587
I can't track her anymore. I'm sorry.

25:50.758 --> 25:54.125
Don't be. This is her father's shop.

26:01.644 --> 26:02.975
You again. Out.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.439
This is a private establishment,
you're not welcome!

26:05.523 --> 26:06.683
Where's Belle?

26:06.774 --> 26:07.889
lwon't let anything happen to her, Moe.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.064
We're just worried.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.567
Don't be. She's safe.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.069
So you can stop looking.

26:13.156 --> 26:15.488
Look, if I could just have the chance
to talk to her...

26:15.658 --> 26:17.819
You want to destroy Belle
like you destroy everything else.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.945
Well, I won't let that happen.

26:22.123 --> 26:23.283
What have you done with her?

26:23.458 --> 26:24.743
There was only one way
to get her away from you.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.746
-What have you done?
-I have to make her forget about you.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.452
No matter the cost.

26:29.630 --> 26:32.121
Even if it means she forgets me, too.

26:33.676 --> 26:36.338
He's sending her across the town line.

26:42.852 --> 26:44.683
Where are you sending Belle across?

26:44.771 --> 26:46.432
You know we have patrols
on the Storybrooke line

26:46.522 --> 26:48.604
to make sure
no one crosses accidentally.

26:48.691 --> 26:50.852
So how are you planning to pull it off?

26:52.028 --> 26:54.940
Where? Where are you
sending her across? Tell me where!

26:55.114 --> 26:57.025
Stop it! You're gonna kill him.

26:57.158 --> 26:58.147
(PANTING)

27:00.787 --> 27:02.493
You've been down in the mines.

27:04.165 --> 27:06.531
The tunnels. They lead out of town.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.053
MAN: Milah, what happened?
MILAH: Fetch some water.

27:18.179 --> 27:19.214
MAN: Get the Captain water!

27:19.305 --> 27:20.636
MILAH: And get me
that prisoner from below deck

27:20.723 --> 27:21.838
along with the booty he carried.

27:21.933 --> 27:24.049
-Now!
-MAN: Bring up the prisoner!

27:24.185 --> 27:27.393
Well, well. Seems like
you've finally found the family

27:27.480 --> 27:30.017
you could never have with me.

27:31.234 --> 27:34.317
MAN: All right,
get your sorry ass up there.

27:46.374 --> 27:48.410
You asked to see it, now you have.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.165
Do we have a deal?

27:50.419 --> 27:52.330
Can we go our separate ways?

27:52.505 --> 27:55.247
Do you mean, do I forgive you?

27:55.550 --> 27:57.586
Can I move on?

27:57.927 --> 28:00.259
Perhaps. Perhaps.

28:01.013 --> 28:05.677
I can see you are truly in love.

28:06.936 --> 28:08.426
Thank you.

28:08.563 --> 28:10.099
Just one question.

28:11.524 --> 28:12.604
What do you want to know?

28:13.860 --> 28:16.442
How could you leave Bae?

28:18.364 --> 28:19.353
(RUMBLES, CLANKS)

28:19.448 --> 28:20.528
Do you know what it was like

28:20.616 --> 28:22.607
-walking home that night?
-Rumple...

28:22.743 --> 28:25.405
-Knowing I had to tell our son...
-Please.

28:25.538 --> 28:28.280
...that his mother was dead?

28:28.416 --> 28:31.408
l was wrong to lie to you.
lwas the coward. I know...

28:31.544 --> 28:33.375
You left him! You abandoned him!

28:33.462 --> 28:36.204
And there's not a day that goes by
that I don't feel sorry for that...

28:36.299 --> 28:37.539
Sorry isn't enough.

28:39.302 --> 28:40.712
You let him go.

28:40.887 --> 28:43.799
I let my misery cloud myjudgment.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.047
Why were you so miserable?

28:46.142 --> 28:48.383
Because I never loved you.

28:55.151 --> 28:56.140
(GRUNTS)

29:01.449 --> 29:02.734
No!

29:03.200 --> 29:04.189
(GRUNTS)

29:06.370 --> 29:07.655
(BOTH PANTING)

29:12.001 --> 29:13.332
(WHISPERS) I love you.

29:16.505 --> 29:17.494
(GASPS)

29:19.842 --> 29:20.831
CAPTAIN HOOK: No, no, no.

29:24.513 --> 29:28.176
You may be more powerful now, demon.
But you're no less a coward.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.092
I'll have what I came for now.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.474
You'll have to kill me first.

29:34.607 --> 29:37.394
Ah-ah! I'm afraid that's not in the cards
for you, sonny boy.

29:37.568 --> 29:39.024
-(BLADE SLASHES)
-Ah!

29:39.111 --> 29:40.100
(GROANS)

29:40.196 --> 29:41.356
(PANTING)

29:45.534 --> 29:47.525
I want you alive.

29:48.204 --> 29:51.367
Because I want you to suffer like I did.

29:52.333 --> 29:53.322
(GIGGLES)

29:55.211 --> 29:56.200

(SQUISHES)

29:59.173 --> 30:00.162
(GIGGLES)

30:01.300 --> 30:04.042
Killing me is going to take
a lot more than that, dearie.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.883
Even demons can be killed.
I will find a way.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.348
Well, good luck living long enough.

30:29.412 --> 30:32.904
Please. Please. Please stop!
What are you doing?

30:33.040 --> 30:34.826
Sending you
on a little ride under the town line.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.077
Once you cross,

30:36.168 --> 30:38.580
you'll forget who you were
in the other realm. And who you loved.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.585
This should help you find the key.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.041
I left it at the bottom of the cart.

30:42.133 --> 30:43.168
-Good luck.
-(PANT|NG)

30:44.260 --> 30:45.716
No! Please...

30:45.845 --> 30:48.427
I'm begging you!
Please don't, don't do this!

30:48.931 --> 30:49.920
Please!

30:50.141 --> 30:51.677
(GASPS FEARFULLY)

31:04.363 --> 31:05.352

(GRUNTS)

31:11.746 --> 31:12.735
(SCREAMS)

31:13.956 --> 31:15.742
What's happening?

31:25.468 --> 31:28.130
That is seriously... Wow.

31:35.311 --> 31:37.597
Belle, are you all right?

31:38.481 --> 31:41.644
Yeah, uh, lthink so.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.148
You remember who I am?

31:45.821 --> 31:49.655
I do. Rumplestiltskin, I remember.

31:54.497 --> 31:55.612
Belle, what's wrong?

31:55.831 --> 31:58.573
Thank you for what you just did.

31:58.667 --> 32:02.000
But that doesn't change that you're
too cowardly to be honest with me.

32:02.129 --> 32:03.084
Well, Belle, it'sjust...

32:03.172 --> 32:05.458
I tried to tell him that, Belle.
Come with me, darling.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.502
After what you just tried to do to me?

32:08.135 --> 32:09.636
You're no better, Father.

32:09.804 --> 32:13.296
You don't get to decide
what I do or how I feel. I do.

32:14.308 --> 32:18.267
If either of you cared about me,
you would have listened.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.939
I don't want to see either of you again.

32:24.026 --> 32:25.857
Ever

32:33.786 --> 32:34.821
RUBY: This one is a classic.

32:35.371 --> 32:38.033
The syrup goes on the pancakes,
it's the round things.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.206
But I kind of like
when it gets on everything.

32:42.503 --> 32:45.165
You know, uh, thank you.

32:45.548 --> 32:49.132
I mean, notjust for this,
but for everything.

32:49.802 --> 32:52.885
No worries.
And stay here until you're on your feet.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.678
Granny will be fine with it.

32:55.266 --> 32:57.006
Oh, I almost forgot.

32:57.560 --> 33:00.552
Someone dropped this off for you
at the front desk.

33:35.931 --> 33:38.593
GOLD: "We may sit in our library

33:39.185 --> 33:43.679
"and yet be in all quarters of the earth."

33:45.608 --> 33:46.848
You gave me the key?

33:47.943 --> 33:50.525
I heard of your interest, and l...

33:51.906 --> 33:53.442
I made some inquiries.

33:54.617 --> 33:57.734
There's an apartment for the caretaker
if you want it.

33:57.870 --> 34:00.782
If this is some way to win me back
after everything you've...

34:00.915 --> 34:04.248
(STAMMERING) No.
That's not why I'm here.

34:07.296 --> 34:11.209
I came because you're right.

34:12.968 --> 34:15.129
About me.

34:19.183 --> 34:21.265
I am a coward.

34:22.895 --> 34:25.227
l have been my entire life.

34:31.070 --> 34:35.359
and the power became so important
that I couldn't let go.

34:36.951 --> 34:38.487
Not even

34:41.705 --> 34:45.038
when that meant losing
the most important person in my life.

34:47.044 --> 34:48.124
Your son.

34:49.964 --> 34:53.127
Baelfire is his name.

34:53.801 --> 34:57.168
After he left,
| dedicated myself to finding him.

34:58.764 --> 35:02.348
lwent down many, many paths

35:03.394 --> 35:07.262
until I found a curse that could take me
to the land where he'd escaped.

35:08.649 --> 35:10.185
Here.

35:10.276 --> 35:13.518
And I found myself in this little town.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.898
With only one thing left to do.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.571
Wait for the curse to be broken

35:21.662 --> 35:25.575
so that I could leave and find him.

35:25.749 --> 35:30.083
But instead of looking for him,
you brought magic.

35:30.671 --> 35:32.161
Because I'm still a coward.

35:33.674 --> 35:36.336
Magic has become a crutch

35:37.344 --> 35:39.335
that I can't walk without.

35:40.222 --> 35:41.211
And even if I could,

35:41.849 --> 35:44.090
I now know I can never leave this place.

35:47.438 --> 35:52.102
Because anyone who leaves
forgets the people they love.

35:52.568 --> 35:55.981
So, when you go to look for Baelfire,

35:57.406 --> 35:58.987
you won't know him.

36:03.287 --> 36:05.869
Magic comes with a price.

36:07.583 --> 36:10.746
Belle, l have to break this new curse.

36:10.961 --> 36:13.202
That's why I was using magic

36:13.339 --> 36:16.251
that night you saw me,
down in the basement.

36:20.095 --> 36:24.213
l have lost so much that I loved.

36:27.186 --> 36:30.223
I didn't wanna lose you again

36:30.314 --> 36:34.023
without you knowing everything.

36:40.491 --> 36:42.777
Goodbye, Belle.

36:51.794 --> 36:53.034
Do you, um...

36:53.128 --> 36:55.835
Have you ever had a hamburger?

36:59.510 --> 37:01.091
Yes, of course.

37:02.137 --> 37:05.095
Well, I haven't.

37:05.182 --> 37:09.016
Butlhear
that Granny's makes a great one.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.186
Maybe...

37:13.273 --> 37:16.356
Maybe we could try it sometime?

37:19.071 --> 37:21.483
I would like that.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.443
No.

37:59.194 --> 38:00.695
He tricked me!

38:28.140 --> 38:29.300
MAN: (MUFFLED VOICE) Hey! Hey!

38:32.186 --> 38:33.596
Allow him to speak.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.434
I want my bean!

38:38.567 --> 38:40.853
Let me tell you how it works on my ship.

38:40.944 --> 38:44.402
| make the demands, you follow them.
The bean's now mine.

38:45.157 --> 38:46.567
You have to give me something for it.

38:46.742 --> 38:49.199
IWiII. Your life.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.572
The chance to join my crew.

38:51.747 --> 38:53.112
So instead of the promise of eternal life,

38:53.248 --> 38:55.034
| get to scrub blood off your decks?
How is that right?

38:55.167 --> 38:57.499
And what if I was to tell you
l was about to set sail to a land

38:57.586 --> 39:01.875
where none of us will ever grow old?

39:01.965 --> 39:05.173
Where I can discover how
to get my revenge on Rumplestiltskin.

39:07.346 --> 39:08.506
I'd say I could live with that.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.387
Good. What's your name, sailor?

39:11.975 --> 39:14.762
William. William Smee.

39:16.939 --> 39:18.930
Can I have my hat?

39:22.069 --> 39:23.855
CAPTAIN HOOK: Well, Mr. Smee,

39:23.987 --> 39:25.318
welcome aboard.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.077
Harden up
and get ready to set sail, mates!

39:35.374 --> 39:37.410
There's bumpy seas ahead!

39:44.258 --> 39:45.589
What's the name of
the place we're headed, Captain?

39:50.973 --> 39:52.929
Neverland.

40:24.881 --> 40:29.124
You're probably wondering
why I brought you here.

40:31.513 --> 40:33.049
I found this

40:33.515 --> 40:35.346
in the mines,

40:36.393 --> 40:37.929
Mr. Smee.

40:38.020 --> 40:39.055
lam so sorry. I didn't...

40:39.271 --> 40:41.808
I'm not interested in apologies.

40:42.858 --> 40:45.190
I'm interested in information.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.193
About the man you work for.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.733
I'll tell you anything you want to know
about Moe. Just...

40:50.824 --> 40:53.861
No, no. Not about Moe.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.193
Your captain.

40:57.914 --> 40:59.745
Where is he?

41:00.459 --> 41:02.871
I've never seen him in Storybrooke,
I swear.

41:03.003 --> 41:04.709
For some reason, when the curse hit,

41:05.339 --> 41:07.204
it didn't take him.

41:08.717 --> 41:11.800
Then where is he?

41:28.487 --> 41:30.193
Hello, Hook.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.779
Hello, Cora.

41:33.617 --> 41:37.201
You told me you had something
important you needed to show me.

41:41.124 --> 41:43.410
Sparkly dirt? Wonderful.

41:43.585 --> 41:46.167
Just the remains of a magical wardrobe

41:47.047 --> 41:49.333
that can travel between worlds.

41:50.217 --> 41:51.832
Is there enough to get us
to where we need to go?

41:52.010 --> 41:55.093
Not quite. But it's a start.

41:56.306 --> 41:58.262
Then we're almost ready to set sail.

41:58.475 --> 42:00.090
What's our port of destination?

42:00.185 --> 42:01.391
Storybrooke.

42:02.104 --> 42:04.436
Curious name. Is that where...

42:04.606 --> 42:06.062
She is.

42:06.900 --> 42:08.640
And so is he.

42:09.945 --> 42:11.731
Excellent.

42:11.822 --> 42:15.030
You'll be able to see your daughter

42:15.117 --> 42:17.153
and I can skin myself a crocodile.
