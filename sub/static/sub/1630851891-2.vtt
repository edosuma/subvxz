WEBVTT

00:10.560 --> 00:12.440
<i>I'd say his earlier crimes</i>

00:12.520 --> 00:14.480
<i>reflected his distorted views
on our society</i>

00:14.560 --> 00:17.600
<i>and were focused on seeking revenge
against society as a whole.</i>

00:19.360 --> 00:22.880
<i>But his later crimes
revealed his true character.</i>

00:25.320 --> 00:27.000
<i>It had a sexual component.</i>

00:27.080 --> 00:31.960
<i>They were also linked
to his frustration and anger toward women</i>

00:32.040 --> 00:34.160
<i>as well as to his determination
to punish them.</i>

00:42.880 --> 00:44.720
<i>There hasn't been much progress</i>

00:44.800 --> 00:45.920
<i>in the investigation
of the Hyehwa-dong murder</i>

00:46.000 --> 00:47.480
<i>which took place yesterday.</i>

00:51.720 --> 00:53.920
<i>There have been four murders</i>

00:54.000 --> 00:56.040
<i>targeting affluent residential areas
in Seoul</i>

00:56.120 --> 00:57.960
<i>in the past two months alone.</i>

01:00.640 --> 01:04.280
<i>CCTV camera footage from a building
located about 200m away from the scene</i>

01:04.360 --> 01:08.440
<i>provides a rear view of a man in his 20s
who is suspected to be the killer.</i>

01:08.520 --> 01:10.960
VIDEO INTERVIEW

01:11.480 --> 01:13.320
<i>And the shoe print found at the scene</i>

01:13.400 --> 01:16.280
<i>is similar to the shoe prints found
in the Gugi-dong and Samseong-dong cases…</i>

01:16.360 --> 01:17.200
GUGI-DONG, SAMSEONG-DONG, HYEHWA-DONG

01:17.280 --> 01:20.000
Ultimately, the word "serial"
had to come out.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.480
When the time came,
it was widely reported.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.240
People became very anxious and concerned

01:28.320 --> 01:30.840
once all the news reports

01:30.920 --> 01:36.280
officially started calling it
a serial murder case.

01:37.960 --> 01:42.120
In order to track down the nation's
first known serial killer at the time,

01:43.800 --> 01:47.960
<i>about 80 detectives came together
and launched a joint investigation team.</i>

01:49.120 --> 01:50.120
Please cooperate.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.160
There have been a number of violent crimes
in Gangnam recently,

01:53.240 --> 01:56.160
so we're conducting stops
and searches at the moment.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.000
<i>We wanted to do everything</i>

01:58.080 --> 02:02.120
<i>that was humanly possible to investigate
the case and catch the killer</i>

02:02.200 --> 02:03.960
so we could stop the murders.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.960
Those murders had happened
but remained unsolved.

02:10.040 --> 02:17.040
And another terrible case was awaiting us.

02:38.760 --> 02:42.840
<i>This type of case was unprecedented
in Korea at the time,</i>

02:45.480 --> 02:47.560
<i>and we had no idea</i>

02:47.640 --> 02:50.680
<i>what type of person the killer was,</i>

02:52.600 --> 02:55.360
so it was very hard.
It was mentally exhausting.

02:58.840 --> 03:02.600
<i>These incidents all targeted
affluent residents</i>

03:02.680 --> 03:04.200
<i>and required breaking into their homes.</i>

03:04.280 --> 03:06.520
<i>And the victims were hit in the head
with a blunt weapon</i>

03:06.600 --> 03:08.000
akin to a hammer.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.880
<i>Every morning,</i>

03:11.960 --> 03:15.320
we'd receive reports

03:16.200 --> 03:18.400
on all the incidents

03:18.480 --> 03:20.880
that had occurred the day before.

03:20.960 --> 03:25.440
<i>So we'd look for cases
that exhibited similar patterns.</i>

03:28.680 --> 03:35.000
After finishing our routine work,
from 10 to 11 at night.

03:35.080 --> 03:39.280
<i>Then I'd return to the office
and keep thinking about the case.</i>

03:39.360 --> 03:43.320
"How should we approach this?
What is the best way to investigate this?"

03:48.440 --> 03:51.600
I didn't even go home for three months.
I slept in the office.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.640
I checked in with my teammates
every day to get updates and so on.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.040
<i>My family dropped off fresh underwear
for me from time to time.</i>

03:58.120 --> 04:01.520
I always ate out or grabbed
a quick bite to eat on the go.

04:03.800 --> 04:04.640
VIDEO INTERVIEW

04:04.720 --> 04:09.160
We had no leads. We were like,
"How are we going to catch this bastard?"

04:09.240 --> 04:11.480
We kept trying to figure out
what we could do.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.640
Then, another incident took place
in the midst of all this.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.840
Rumors about a serial killer
are circulating in Southwestern Seoul.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.440
<i>A high school girl,
who was on her way home</i>

04:31.520 --> 04:32.840
<i>after parting ways with her grandmother,</i>

04:32.920 --> 04:35.560
<i>was randomly stabbed multiple times.</i>

04:35.640 --> 04:37.920
<i>And a female college student
was brutally murdered on her way home</i>

04:38.000 --> 04:39.720
<i>after meeting her boyfriend.</i>

04:40.640 --> 04:42.720
CCTV CAMERA AREA

04:44.640 --> 04:49.400
He committed many crimes in this area.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.000
But we never thought
one of us would be his victim.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.280
It was only in hindsight that we realized
it could happen to us as well.

04:59.680 --> 05:03.440
<i>At the time, my wife…</i>

05:04.400 --> 05:06.960
<i>She had less than
a 30-percent chance at survival.</i>

05:07.680 --> 05:09.400
<i>She was covered in blood.</i>

05:10.160 --> 05:12.560
<i>She lost her consciousness and collapsed,</i>

05:12.640 --> 05:14.360
<i>so I rushed her to the hospital.</i>

05:18.960 --> 05:20.880
<i>I will never forget that day.</i>

05:21.440 --> 05:22.480
I just can't.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.640
Horror took over me
before I could even feel rage.

05:29.400 --> 05:33.080
I can't even begin to describe my anger.
The enormity of it.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.560
Everything was shattered.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.520
My life had changed completely.

05:40.760 --> 05:44.440
Everything had changed.
Our life was put on halt at that moment.

05:44.920 --> 05:49.280
My wife is suffering from a brain lesion.
She now has a disability.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.320
It's something the whole family has to
live with for the rest of their lives.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.400
It doesn't end there.
It's something that stays with them.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.960
These victims have to live with it
for the rest of their lives.

06:00.040 --> 06:04.240
There needs to be some kind
of compensation for victims like us.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.720
<i>It was the government
who failed to protect them.</i>

06:16.840 --> 06:20.840
<i>All the cases I'm telling you about,</i>

06:22.080 --> 06:25.320
<i>I still see them in a panoramic view
before my eyes.</i>

06:25.920 --> 06:29.360
I still remember everything so vividly
even though over a decade has passed

06:30.000 --> 06:32.680
because I poured my heart and soul
into the investigation,

06:32.760 --> 06:35.280
and all those memories
are deeply engraved in my heart.

06:37.040 --> 06:40.000
The memories unfold before my eyes
like a motion picture.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.720
Everything, down to the last detail.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.800
At the time, I was the captain

06:49.880 --> 06:53.320
of the Mobile Investigation Unit
at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.000
THE SEOUL SOUTHWESTERN MURDERS

06:58.080 --> 07:01.720
<i>A number of motiveless murders occurred
in the southwestern region of Seoul.</i>

07:03.440 --> 07:05.480
One of them was in Singil-dong.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.160
The next one took place
in Bongcheon-dong in Gwanak District.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.520
Then in Geumcheon-dong and Doksan-dong.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.040
One after another.
They looked like serial killings.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.920
<i>The killer's modus operandi was…</i>

07:30.840 --> 07:33.880
<i>He'd target women who were walking alone</i>

07:35.120 --> 07:38.200
<i>and attack them with a knife
or a blunt weapon from behind</i>

07:39.000 --> 07:40.920
<i>and kill them for no reason and run away.</i>

07:45.760 --> 07:48.120
I was under a lot of stress
because of this case.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.240
So were all the detectives in my unit.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.720
It was very stressful for all of us.

07:55.560 --> 07:59.840
There were about 150 officers
in the Mobile Investigation Unit.

07:59.920 --> 08:03.720
Whenever there was a big case,
we all went to the scene.

08:08.200 --> 08:12.400
At the time, I was the youngest one
in the Mobile Investigation Unit.

08:14.280 --> 08:20.480
<i>One of my tasks was
collecting intel from our informants.</i>

08:23.120 --> 08:26.880
We had to conduct stakeouts to catch him.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.800
To not give ourselves away,

08:33.880 --> 08:36.880
we'd sit inside a hot car for hours.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.679
It was awful.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.799
We barely got out of the car.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.480
We'd park the car in a corner spot
and just sleep there.

08:48.559 --> 08:53.360
We used the rear-view mirror a lot
to keep a lookout for him at night.

08:53.920 --> 08:59.800
<i>We kept blankets and things to eat
such as bread in the car.</i>

09:04.120 --> 09:07.080
We felt that we had to catch him
for the sake of the team's honor.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.040
SEOUL POLICE GANGNAM

09:15.960 --> 09:19.240
The word on the street was that
these brutal killings

09:19.320 --> 09:21.720
were committed by the same person.

09:24.680 --> 09:28.920
But I kept wondering why
the MO had changed a little.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.520
I was puzzled.

09:35.720 --> 09:39.360
The pattern had completely changed.

09:39.440 --> 09:43.720
These victims were attacked randomly
in public spaces, such as the streets.

09:48.160 --> 09:53.680
"Why would someone with such rage,
who had premeditatively planned

09:53.760 --> 09:55.800
and thoroughly prepared
for those break-ins,

09:56.840 --> 10:02.440
<i>suddenly change his weapon
to something that is less lethal?"</i>

10:02.520 --> 10:04.880
<i>I didn't think we could assume
he was now randomly</i>

10:04.960 --> 10:08.680
attacking people on the streets as his old
method wasn't as thrilling anymore.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.440
It seemed like a different case.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.080
Two different active serial killers
roaming free…

10:25.160 --> 10:27.240
No one could have even imagined that.

10:30.600 --> 10:34.640
Having more than one serial killer
actively operating at the same time

10:34.720 --> 10:37.440
is rare, even in other countries.

10:43.480 --> 10:48.120
So that was simply unimaginable in Korea.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.960
THE BREAK-IN MURDERS

10:53.040 --> 10:57.000
<i>After the incident in Hyehwa-dong,
nothing happened for a while.</i>

10:58.160 --> 11:01.640
There was a lull.
The cases came to a stop.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.360
<i>So we thought,
"He's probably being careful.</i>

11:09.440 --> 11:12.520
He's being careful
to gauge the situation."

11:12.600 --> 11:15.000
That's what we all thought.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.080
<i>But we knew he'd eventually reappear</i>

11:18.160 --> 11:21.000
<i>because those urges
weren't something he could control.</i>

11:26.280 --> 11:30.840
<i>To me, night and day existed
as two completely different worlds.</i>

11:32.640 --> 11:36.120
<i>In the daytime, I was just an average man.
But I became a murderer at night.</i>

11:38.480 --> 11:40.760
<i>My intelligence and rationality</i>

11:40.840 --> 11:43.680
<i>succumbed to my murderous instinct
that awoke each night.</i>

11:56.840 --> 12:00.240
<i>Murderers constantly seek
to remove obstacles that prevent them</i>

12:00.720 --> 12:04.400
from committing the kinds of murders
they fantasize about.

12:04.480 --> 12:08.520
GUGI-DONG, HYEHWA-DONG
SINSA-DONG, SAMSEONG-DONG

12:08.600 --> 12:10.160
<i>He wanted to kill more people,</i>

12:10.240 --> 12:14.560
<i>so he started luring victims to places
where he could kill them</i>

12:14.640 --> 12:16.800
<i>without having to worry
about such obstacles.</i>

12:18.400 --> 12:23.320
So he purposely chose victims
whose disappearance would go unnoticed.

12:28.120 --> 12:32.800
Even at the time,
prostitution was illegal.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.000
But it was rampant.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.840
<i>That was because corrupt police officers
in various regions</i>

12:50.640 --> 12:55.080
<i>turned a blind eye to the problem
or even protected the businesses.</i>

12:59.440 --> 13:02.360
Everyone here is very tough.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.040
Everyone in this business is.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.840
<i>I've been in this line of work
for about 35 years.</i>

13:08.360 --> 13:10.160
I don't want to give out my name.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.760
<i>Back in 1999 to 2000,</i>

13:14.840 --> 13:18.640
<i>we had a lot of customers
because the business could operate openly.</i>

13:20.720 --> 13:23.880
<i>I don't know
if I can talk about this here,</i>

13:25.240 --> 13:28.560
but corruption was rampant at the time.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.480
<i>The prostitutes had little value
to the police,</i>

13:35.960 --> 13:38.720
but some of the pimps
were crucial informants for us.

13:40.680 --> 13:43.360
<i>The owners and the police
had formed a close relationship.</i>

13:43.440 --> 13:47.200
They bribed the police officers regularly.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.360
<i>As soon as I was appointed,</i>

13:51.440 --> 13:55.440
I ordered the officers
to never take bribes.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.760
<i>"If you take bribes, you're dead meat."</i>

14:06.400 --> 14:09.840
I was the first female police chief
in the country.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.120
<i>At the time,</i>

14:19.200 --> 14:21.440
<i>we had launched a crackdown
on prostitution.</i>

14:24.960 --> 14:28.280
<i>They were women in financial trouble.
Some of them were lured or abducted.</i>

14:32.600 --> 14:37.520
<i>I was tricked by an advertisement
and got pulled into sex work.</i>

14:38.880 --> 14:42.400
I stumbled upon an ad that said,
"Female Cafe Server Wanted.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.800
Three million won a month.
Room and board provided."

14:44.880 --> 14:49.080
I saw the ad
and went to Seoul for the job.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.880
But when I got there,
I realized it was a brothel.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.520
That happened to me once.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.640
<i>I was working at a brothel like that.</i>

14:58.720 --> 15:02.400
But at the time, I had no one

15:02.480 --> 15:05.600
to call for help in dangerous situations.

15:05.680 --> 15:10.240
So I was always worried,
thinking about things like,

15:10.320 --> 15:12.480
"What if something happens to me?"

15:15.760 --> 15:20.360
I wanted to protect them
from the sex buyers and brothel operators.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.720
I went there knowing that
it'd be a difficult crackdown operation.

15:30.360 --> 15:35.200
It was a very dangerous area,
with gangsters and thugs.

15:38.320 --> 15:39.200
Don't move.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.520
Stay still!

15:40.600 --> 15:41.880
What the hell?

15:52.080 --> 15:55.440
The pimps threatened me,
and some of my colleagues slandered me.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.800
<i>They kept threatening me.</i>

15:59.880 --> 16:03.520
They said things like, "We will kill you."
"We will kill both of your daughters."

16:05.720 --> 16:07.760
<i>That made me extremely anxious.</i>

16:07.840 --> 16:09.560
<i>"We will kill both of your daughters."</i>

16:09.640 --> 16:12.960
They even figured out
which schools my daughters were attending.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.320
<i>They threatened me that they'd kill me
if I exposed them.</i>

16:18.840 --> 16:21.080
-Did you confirm their ages?
-Yes, ma'am.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.200
Isn't she a minor?

16:22.280 --> 16:23.400
No, she's not a minor.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.680
It's okay. Sit down.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.840
I knew that many sex workers
had gone missing

16:31.920 --> 16:34.840
because there were many rumors
and reports about such cases.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.480
In that red-light district,

16:44.280 --> 16:48.840
there were many gangsters and pimps.
So committing murder there was impossible.

16:49.400 --> 16:53.200
<i>But it was possible if businesses
were operating underground.</i>

16:53.280 --> 16:56.960
<i>Underground bars, karaoke lounges,</i>

16:58.120 --> 17:00.480
<i>and so on, for example.
On-site massage services too.</i>

17:00.560 --> 17:02.160
Then killing the women becomes possible

17:02.240 --> 17:05.520
because prostitution takes place
elsewhere, not at the place of business.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.520
They go to the place
where the customer wants to meet.

17:11.119 --> 17:12.040
<i>We had no idea.</i>

17:14.200 --> 17:16.359
How could we have known?
Unless we were God.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.599
<i>He'd call a girl over</i>

17:27.680 --> 17:29.599
and have a conversation with her first.

17:29.680 --> 17:33.960
They'd have dinner together, and he'd even
cook instant noodles for her.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.800
In a way, we could say
he deprived them of their right to live

17:38.880 --> 17:41.840
based on his arbitrary judgment.

17:43.040 --> 17:47.000
<i>He believed that he was almighty
and considered himself equal with God.</i>

17:49.440 --> 17:52.000
After having sex,
the woman would get ready to leave.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.400
<i>Then he'd drag her to the bathroom and…</i>

17:56.080 --> 17:59.880
<i>He called the bathroom door sill,</i>

18:00.520 --> 18:03.080
"The threshold between life and death."

18:03.160 --> 18:04.360
That's what he called it.

18:08.480 --> 18:13.320
<i>"In this space, I have complete control</i>

18:13.880 --> 18:17.040
over this person's life."

18:17.600 --> 18:19.880
That was his mindset.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.200
The hammer was always on the shelf there.
That's where he kept it.

18:32.280 --> 18:37.320
So upon grabbing it, he'd whack
the victim with it at full speed.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.520
He'd strike the victim's head.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.840
He said so himself.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.240
<i>He killed his victims quickly, but spent
a lot of time desecrating the bodies.</i>

19:01.080 --> 19:05.280
Desecrating the bodies
made him feel that he was in control

19:05.360 --> 19:06.880
of his victims.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.200
After severing the head
and tying the hair up with a rubber band…

19:18.600 --> 19:20.440
he hung it from the toilet paper holder.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.960
<i>He did this in his apartment,
so he needed to dispose of the body.</i>

19:27.680 --> 19:29.720
<i>After mulling over how to dispose of them…</i>

19:31.440 --> 19:36.040
His apartment, which was like his hideout,
was on the third floor of the building.

19:36.120 --> 19:38.200
If he just carried them down,
he'd be spotted.

19:42.240 --> 19:46.040
So he decided to chop up the body

19:46.680 --> 19:49.920
and dispose of it in a plastic bag.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.720
<i>He went and got an X-ray done
at the hospital.</i>

19:55.800 --> 19:57.800
<i>He asked them to burn
the results onto a CD.</i>

20:01.400 --> 20:03.560
<i>He did that
so he could study human anatomy.</i>

20:04.120 --> 20:06.760
He then chopped the corpse into 16 pieces.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.920
After that, he could do it very quickly.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.840
He studied human anatomy a lot.

20:16.320 --> 20:20.000
He studied it in depth.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.840
<i>Do you know when I was frightened the most</i>

20:26.920 --> 20:29.840
<i>while committing this brutal act?</i>

20:31.880 --> 20:35.240
<i>There was a moment
that made my hair stand on end.</i>

20:35.320 --> 20:36.160
SEVERED HEAD

20:36.240 --> 20:39.720
<i>It was not the moment when
the severed head fell off the towel rack.</i>

20:46.840 --> 20:47.960
<i>Hello?</i>

20:51.680 --> 20:55.000
<i>It was the moment my son called</i>

20:55.080 --> 20:57.520
<i>when I was in the middle
of chopping up the body.</i>

20:59.680 --> 21:02.200
<i>I wasn't startled by the phone ringing.</i>

21:02.280 --> 21:04.840
<i>But when my son heard
my agitated voice, he asked me,</i>

21:04.920 --> 21:07.000
<i>"Do you still have a cold, Dad?"</i>

21:07.080 --> 21:09.280
DAD, I KNOW EVERYTHING

21:09.360 --> 21:10.720
<i>To me, that sounded like,</i>

21:11.240 --> 21:14.800
"Dad, I know everything. Don't do it."

21:14.880 --> 21:17.000
I felt as though he was saying that.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.640
DON'T DO IT

21:26.400 --> 21:29.360
They said the water usage at his apartment
was about five tons.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.440
You know what that means, right?

21:31.520 --> 21:33.240
He washed the bodies,

21:33.320 --> 21:36.000
put them in plastic bags,
and threw them into his suitcase.

21:43.120 --> 21:46.560
A rotting corpse smells a lot worse
than rotting animal carcasses.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.000
So he thought he'd mix them with kimchi,
so no one will know

21:51.080 --> 21:53.120
because of the pungent smell
from the kimchi.

21:53.200 --> 21:57.480
So he threw aged kimchi in there
and mixed it all up.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.400
Then he put it in a black plastic bag,
and it only came up to here.

22:03.760 --> 22:04.760
It wasn't that big.

22:12.600 --> 22:17.080
So that night, he left his place with it
and hailed a cab.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.720
The taxi driver asked him,

22:23.400 --> 22:26.800
"What is this smell? Is it kimchi?
It smells awful."

22:29.400 --> 22:33.720
<i>And he said, "It's aged kimchi
my mom gave me."</i>

22:34.280 --> 22:36.320
That's how he got past the suspicions.

22:46.760 --> 22:50.720
<i>There was this secluded plot of land.
You have to hike a little to get there.</i>

22:52.320 --> 22:54.640
<i>He needed to bury the body, you know.</i>

22:54.720 --> 22:57.800
<i>He had to get rid of all the evidence
to commit a perfect crime.</i>

23:03.680 --> 23:06.720
He found this flat plot of land,

23:06.800 --> 23:08.560
and dug a hole there.

23:08.640 --> 23:12.000
About 50cm deep.
That's where he buried the body.

23:17.200 --> 23:23.080
<i>The flat area was small,
and he wanted to kill more people.</i>

23:24.040 --> 23:27.680
<i>So he dug another hole
about 30cm away from that spot</i>

23:28.840 --> 23:31.560
because finding another burial ground
wouldn't be easy.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.200
<i>When we're under a lot of stress,</i>

23:44.280 --> 23:47.120
doing something
that can help us relieve stress

23:47.200 --> 23:51.640
makes us feel calm.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.920
But in his case,
that something was murder.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.240
He gradually became quicker.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.680
<i>And soon…</i>

24:06.680 --> 24:09.600
the frequency of the murders increased.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.720
<i>At first, the interval was about a month.</i>

24:16.120 --> 24:18.080
<i>Then it became 15 days.</i>

24:23.160 --> 24:26.800
<i>And then, he started doing it once a week,</i>

24:27.800 --> 24:33.400
which tells us that
he was becoming very skilled at it.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.080
There could be 100 victims…

24:49.360 --> 24:51.560
The deceased victims can't talk.

24:55.080 --> 24:59.240
<i>They can't tell us how they were killed.</i>

25:00.920 --> 25:03.400
<i>Nobody really knows
what kinds of brutal, inhumane acts</i>

25:03.480 --> 25:06.000
<i>they had to suffer
until their last breath.</i>

25:06.080 --> 25:07.400
<i>Nobody knows.</i>

25:10.360 --> 25:11.640
<i>No one cared.</i>

25:14.960 --> 25:19.360
A sex worker's disappearance

25:19.440 --> 25:22.240
often goes unnoticed.

25:22.320 --> 25:26.960
Many sex workers
don't talk to their families

25:27.440 --> 25:29.640
and live in isolation.

25:31.600 --> 25:37.960
They're often neglected in our society.

25:40.360 --> 25:43.440
<i>And quite frankly, not much has changed
in that regard.</i>

25:43.520 --> 25:47.360
In Korean society, sex workers…

25:48.480 --> 25:50.840
or women who engage in sex work

25:51.600 --> 25:53.280
<i>are treated as less than human.</i>

25:54.320 --> 25:58.120
Sex workers can't call the police
even when they're exposed to crime.

25:58.200 --> 26:02.040
And there are clients
who try to take advantage of it.

26:03.640 --> 26:07.200
So that's why he knew
he wouldn't get caught

26:07.760 --> 26:09.520
no matter how many women he killed.

26:13.360 --> 26:17.080
No one filed a police report.
The victims couldn't. There was nothing.

26:17.160 --> 26:21.200
We didn't even know such cases existed.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.080
<i>The brothel owners
didn't report the disappearances.</i>

26:25.160 --> 26:29.240
Why? Because they were afraid
it'd expose their businesses.

26:30.520 --> 26:34.680
<i>One of the owners was an ex-cop.</i>

26:35.760 --> 26:38.360
He was a pimp
who made money off his prostitutes.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.920
<i>The women he was managing</i>

26:41.600 --> 26:43.040
kept disappearing one by one.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.800
He sent them out,
but they never came back.

26:44.880 --> 26:49.600
Of course, it could've looked
as if they had run away.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.000
<i>But he thought it was odd,</i>

26:53.600 --> 26:56.720
<i>and that something must have
happened to these women.</i>

27:05.440 --> 27:09.360
Someone called the brothel
asking for a girl.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.800
<i>And the owner of the brothel</i>

27:14.440 --> 27:16.560
<i>recognized the phone number immediately</i>

27:16.640 --> 27:20.080
<i>because it was one of his girls' numbers.</i>

27:21.200 --> 27:26.440
One of the girls who disappeared.

27:26.520 --> 27:29.280
So he suspected that this man
could be the culprit.

27:33.320 --> 27:37.680
<i>That brothel owner
was a crucial informant.</i>

27:39.240 --> 27:44.480
He called a detective he personally knew
at Gangnam Police Station,

27:45.200 --> 27:47.960
but the detective was exhausted
that night.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.000
He was sleep-deprived.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.160
So he conked out and missed the call.

27:53.240 --> 27:56.320
After that, he called a detective he knew
in the Regional Investigation Unit.

27:56.400 --> 28:00.280
JULY 15, 2004

28:02.480 --> 28:03.520
That night…

28:05.160 --> 28:08.960
<i>I had been on a stakeout
for three days in a row.</i>

28:10.120 --> 28:12.280
<i>I got home past midnight.</i>

28:13.280 --> 28:16.240
It was a hot day, so I took a shower
and went straight to bed.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.840
My phone started ringing,
maybe from around 2:00 a.m.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.080
Someone kept calling me.

28:21.680 --> 28:25.400
It was the informant.
He told me to come quickly.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.760
<i>So I got to Sinchon in 30 minutes.</i>

28:31.320 --> 28:32.880
<i>It was pretty far.</i>

28:38.000 --> 28:41.240
And when I got there,
I didn't know anyone else there.

28:45.960 --> 28:49.640
<i>I only knew the informant,
so I was talking to him.</i>

28:50.120 --> 28:52.040
I told him, "This guy has to call
for us to track him down.

28:52.120 --> 28:54.800
Has he called again since then?"

28:54.880 --> 28:56.400
And he said
he was waiting for him to call.

28:56.480 --> 29:00.880
So I said, "All right.
Then let's wait in the car. It's too hot."

29:03.280 --> 29:05.560
<i>We didn't know his name.
We knew nothing about him.</i>

29:06.720 --> 29:10.800
But the informant said
a few of his girls ran away like that,

29:12.760 --> 29:16.960
so I thought that
this was a kidnapping case.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.800
In any case, my goal was to catch him.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.360
<i>The important thing was that</i>

29:25.080 --> 29:28.880
<i>we had to use a woman to catch him.</i>

29:31.000 --> 29:33.880
So we had a girl ready.

29:37.640 --> 29:38.880
Then we got the call.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.200
We asked him
where the girl should meet him.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.560
He told us to send her
to a small park near Hongik University.

29:50.160 --> 29:53.840
<i>We were following her secretly,</i>

29:53.920 --> 29:55.800
and she was walking alone.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.920
But when we got there…

30:06.880 --> 30:08.120
We were nearby, watching.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.560
<i>I was standing, smoking a cigarette,</i>

30:13.680 --> 30:15.600
but I saw her walking back toward me.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.560
I asked her, "What happened?"

30:22.000 --> 30:24.040
<i>And she said, "He just told me to go."</i>

30:25.760 --> 30:30.480
I was like, "Why?"
She told me he said she was too tall.

30:35.680 --> 30:39.400
So I thought to myself, "Is he testing us?

30:39.480 --> 30:42.360
Or is this some kind of prank?"

30:46.840 --> 30:49.560
<i>He selected women
he thought would be easier to kill</i>

30:49.640 --> 30:51.280
and dispose of.

30:53.960 --> 30:57.520
If the woman was on the chubbier side
or too tall,

30:58.000 --> 30:59.280
it'd be harder for him

31:00.480 --> 31:02.800
to dismember and dispose of the body.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.720
It'd be more difficult, you know.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.080
So he only took home
women who weren't big or tall.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.680
If the woman wasn't his preferred size,
he let her go.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.200
<i>Then he called for a girl again.</i>

31:20.840 --> 31:22.640
He told her to meet him in an alleyway.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.000
<i>She called us and said,</i>

31:36.000 --> 31:38.680
<i>"There's some weirdo here.
I think he's the guy who called."</i>

31:39.840 --> 31:41.520
So I just ran. I ran there.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.880
<i>And on my way there,
I told them to call the police at once.</i>

31:49.440 --> 31:53.920
That night, I was at home sleeping
after a stakeout

31:54.000 --> 31:57.480
for the southwestern murders

31:58.400 --> 32:00.560
when Detective Yang Pil-joo called me.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.000
He said some sex workers were missing…

32:02.080 --> 32:04.640
That was my first time
hearing about such disappearances,

32:04.720 --> 32:08.840
but a number of the victims in the
southwestern murders were young women,

32:08.920 --> 32:11.720
so I thought there could be a connection.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.200
<i>So we went after him
because of that sneaking suspicion.</i>

32:17.280 --> 32:19.840
When I got there…

32:20.960 --> 32:27.560
You know those flyers
with the girls' numbers.

32:27.640 --> 32:30.480
He had a bunch of them in his mouth.

32:33.880 --> 32:38.160
He fiercely resisted,

32:38.240 --> 32:41.120
which made me think
that he was probably hiding something.

32:43.600 --> 32:44.600
<i>It was crazy.</i>

32:45.080 --> 32:48.800
He fiercely resisted to the point that
four or five of us struggled to cuff him.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.080
<i>He went on a rampage.</i>

32:58.440 --> 32:59.280
Then…

33:00.720 --> 33:03.000
I think it was that evening.

33:03.080 --> 33:06.200
That evening, after we arrested him.
We didn't have much time.

33:08.280 --> 33:12.160
<i>If we fail to secure enough evidence</i>

33:12.640 --> 33:14.840
<i>to prove that the suspect
committed a crime,</i>

33:14.920 --> 33:17.760
<i>we have to release the suspect
within 48 hours of arrest.</i>

33:18.840 --> 33:22.920
I called Chief Kang Dae-won
and told him to come to the station ASAP.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.920
JULY 15, 2004

33:27.000 --> 33:29.400
I was at home, sleeping.
But at around five,

33:29.480 --> 33:33.560
Lieutenant Park Myung-sun,

33:33.640 --> 33:35.800
who was a detective squad captain
at the time,

33:36.280 --> 33:38.720
called me on my home phone.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.160
To tell you the truth,

33:42.040 --> 33:44.960
I didn't really have to be there.

33:45.440 --> 33:51.000
But I thought it could be linked
to the motiveless murders

33:51.080 --> 33:53.640
that we're investigating.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.720
THE SEOUL SOUTHWESTERN MURDERS

33:55.800 --> 33:59.160
Sinchon is close to Yeongdeungpo
and the Southwestern District.

33:59.240 --> 34:02.440
You get to Guro-gu
right after you cross the Seogang Bridge.

34:02.520 --> 34:03.360
SINCHON, SEOGANG BRIDGE

34:03.440 --> 34:06.720
So I told him,
"Hey, keep him there. I'm coming."

34:16.679 --> 34:19.840
All of us were there, the whole team.
Chief Kang Dae-won was there too.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.480
We all went in there together.

34:21.560 --> 34:25.760
The whole team went into the room
to interrogate him.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.199
<i>His name was…</i>

34:37.880 --> 34:39.159
Yoo Young-chul.

34:44.159 --> 34:48.880
It was mere speculation
that he kidnapped those women.

34:49.440 --> 34:52.320
All we knew for a fact was
that he called the brothel.

34:52.400 --> 34:56.440
We couldn't arrest him with just that
because he wasn't caught in the act.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.199
But the officers who were at the scene
told me that he resisted arrest.

35:00.280 --> 35:04.440
There was no reason to fight back
unless he did something wrong.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.920
They also told me
he was trying to swallow the flyers.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.920
So I thought something was definitely up.

35:16.360 --> 35:20.040
<i>Typically, the criminals we often see
look rough or aggressive.</i>

35:20.120 --> 35:22.240
Maybe some scars on the face.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.960
It was summer,
so I expected to see some tattoos,

35:25.040 --> 35:26.600
but he had none of that.

35:27.680 --> 35:28.920
<i>He looked totally average.</i>

35:29.560 --> 35:31.680
<i>He was a decent-looking man.</i>

35:35.320 --> 35:37.120
<i>But when I saw his eyes,</i>

35:38.120 --> 35:39.560
<i>I could tell something was off.</i>

35:40.400 --> 35:42.960
That was when this thought struck me

35:43.640 --> 35:45.920
that something was off about him.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.160
That he must have done something.

35:49.240 --> 35:52.200
That thought suddenly struck me.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.240
<i>Then one of our detectives</i>

36:05.040 --> 36:07.920
smacked him in the head.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.920
To be honest, he didn't even hit him hard.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.240
He hit him like this.

36:14.320 --> 36:17.800
That was when I noticed,
Young-chul is a bit of a hothead.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.600
He suddenly lost his temper.

36:20.680 --> 36:24.240
He looked at me and said,
"Who's the boss here?"

36:31.680 --> 36:32.680
I asked him why.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.560
Then he said,
"Fuck. All of you will be promoted

36:35.640 --> 36:37.360
if I say that I killed people."

36:37.440 --> 36:38.840
That's what he actually said.

36:38.920 --> 36:42.720
So I said, "Come on now.
There's no way you killed anyone.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.520
I can tell that
you don't have the stomach for it."

36:51.680 --> 36:53.800
Then the detective smacked him again.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.360
And he got mad again.

36:55.440 --> 36:59.200
He said, "Those four murders.
I killed those old bags."

37:01.800 --> 37:04.440
<i>There have been four murders</i>

37:04.520 --> 37:06.720
<i>targeting affluent residential areas
in Seoul</i>

37:07.200 --> 37:09.640
<i>in the past two months alone.</i>

37:09.720 --> 37:11.600
SEOUL POLICE GANGNAM

37:12.400 --> 37:16.160
So I thought to myself, "What is going on?
What's this prick doing? Is he lying?"

37:17.960 --> 37:19.480
<i>It was a huge case.</i>

37:20.200 --> 37:23.600
<i>From September to November 2003,</i>

37:23.680 --> 37:27.560
he broke into four homes

37:27.640 --> 37:29.680
and killed eight to nine people in total.

37:30.320 --> 37:33.880
It was a cold case
that had remained unsolved.

37:36.800 --> 37:41.080
<i>I was sitting there
with an A4 piece of paper next to me.</i>

37:41.160 --> 37:45.720
<i>I brought it in with me
because I wanted to jot down</i>

37:45.800 --> 37:47.760
<i>what he was saying,</i>

37:48.560 --> 37:50.600
but he asked me to hand it over to him.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.720
Then he suddenly started
drawing tally marks.

37:54.800 --> 37:58.200
You know, the little marks that you draw
to keep count.

37:58.280 --> 38:01.040
One, two, three, four, five… Like this.

38:01.120 --> 38:04.040
And he kept going. So I asked him,

38:04.120 --> 38:06.760
"Young-chul, what are these?"

38:07.240 --> 38:10.840
Then he pulled my ear toward him and said,

38:10.920 --> 38:14.280
"Sir, this is
how many people I've killed."

38:17.640 --> 38:19.800
"Is he for real?"

38:23.920 --> 38:25.040
"Is he a lunatic?"

38:25.920 --> 38:27.040
I was shocked.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.280
He said he wanted to make a confession,
so I asked him, "To whom?

38:33.360 --> 38:34.960
Shall I bring a priest?"

38:35.040 --> 38:37.960
He said, "No."
Then he asked us to bring in his mother.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.280
<i>His mother came with his sister.</i>

38:43.400 --> 38:46.760
<i>I think his mother was 62 or 63
at the time.</i>

38:47.520 --> 38:48.960
She looked weak.

38:49.800 --> 38:54.360
Her attitude was basically like,
"What has he done this time?"

38:55.320 --> 38:59.240
She didn't seem like
a loving, caring mother.

39:00.560 --> 39:06.120
I said to her, "We had to arrest him
because of some incident,

39:06.760 --> 39:10.160
but he's saying he wants to confess
to you. Why don't you hear him out?"

39:10.720 --> 39:12.720
I was polite to her.

39:16.840 --> 39:20.120
He'd start talking, then stop.
He kept doing that.

39:23.480 --> 39:26.800
They didn't seem to care at all.
So I said to him, "Just do it.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.680
You said you would."

39:29.560 --> 39:31.400
<i>"I killed a lot of people.</i>

39:32.240 --> 39:33.360
<i>That's why I'm here."</i>

39:36.280 --> 39:38.080
Then his mother suddenly fainted.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.800
She was foaming at the mouth.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.240
I asked the others to call 911
to take her to the hospital.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.800
<i>I was so shocked.</i>

39:48.880 --> 39:51.160
<i>I was so shocked that I passed out.</i>

39:51.720 --> 39:53.920
<i>When I opened my eyes,
I was in the hospital.</i>

39:56.800 --> 39:58.080
<i>I had no idea!</i>

40:00.440 --> 40:04.400
<i>I never even imagined
he'd be out doing such horrendous things.</i>

40:06.480 --> 40:08.800
I took him back to the interview room
and asked him,

40:08.880 --> 40:12.080
Hey, are you sure you did this?
"Then you can come to the scene with us

40:12.600 --> 40:15.160
and help us verify it, right?"

40:15.240 --> 40:17.840
He said, "Sure, of course."
"Really? All right, then."

40:20.120 --> 40:21.760
<i>So we got him in a car.</i>

40:22.320 --> 40:25.000
<i>But then, to do that…</i>

40:25.080 --> 40:29.680
<i>He said to us that
he had killed two people in Gugi-dong…</i>

40:29.760 --> 40:33.320
GUGI-DONG

40:33.920 --> 40:35.840
JULY 15, 2004

40:37.360 --> 40:41.080
We got a call from the Seoul Metropolitan
Police Agency asking us to be on standby.

40:41.160 --> 40:44.400
The detective squad captain at the time

40:44.480 --> 40:46.880
brought Yoo Young-chul to our precinct.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.520
On our way to Gugi-dong,

40:53.600 --> 40:56.520
I told them to pull over near Gugi Tunnel
and get out of the car.

40:56.600 --> 40:57.920
"Everyone, out."

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Then I said to Yoo Young-chul,

41:00.080 --> 41:02.680
"That house is about 500m away from here,
so see if you can find it."

41:07.120 --> 41:08.720
So he started walking,

41:08.800 --> 41:10.840
and we all followed him. "Keep going."

41:11.920 --> 41:14.640
While holding onto the rope
we used to tie him up.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.400
<i>While following him,
the Head of Investigations</i>

41:20.480 --> 41:23.800
at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency,
who I personally knew well,

41:23.880 --> 41:27.680
asked me, "Hey, does he look like

41:28.160 --> 41:30.960
the man in the footage?"

41:38.320 --> 41:42.200
And I was like, "Maybe, kind of.
But I'm not sure."

41:42.280 --> 41:43.600
I couldn't really tell.

41:47.800 --> 41:53.600
When we got there,
he went to the house behind the one

41:53.680 --> 41:55.200
where the murders had occurred.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.120
<i>Nothing he said matched what we knew.</i>

42:01.360 --> 42:02.440
The daughter-in-law…

42:05.720 --> 42:06.840
<i>When she was found dead,</i>

42:08.080 --> 42:10.800
she was lying flat on her face,
but he said she was face up.

42:12.040 --> 42:16.840
<i>The detectives from other precincts
standing next to me</i>

42:16.920 --> 42:20.040
said to me,
"There's no way he's the killer.

42:20.120 --> 42:24.920
He's just one of those lunatics
we encounter from time to time."

42:25.000 --> 42:27.880
When a puppy suddenly showed up,

42:28.520 --> 42:31.920
he stopped, sat down,
and started playing with it.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.960
It was unbelievable.

42:34.040 --> 42:35.440
Seriously, unbelievable.

42:36.240 --> 42:38.400
Everyone was saying, "He's not the guy.

42:38.480 --> 42:39.840
This prick isn't the killer."

42:41.280 --> 42:42.880
So we let our guard down.

42:42.960 --> 42:48.560
Yoo Young-chul had already mapped out
a detailed plan for a situation like that.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.200
It wasn't a simple crime.

42:54.200 --> 42:55.880
<i>He knew exactly how we'd react.</i>

42:56.640 --> 42:59.000
<i>All the detectives.
He was like that all throughout.</i>

43:00.600 --> 43:02.520
The detectives
in the Mobile Investigation Unit

43:02.600 --> 43:06.120
were no longer sure
because of what happened in Gugi-dong

43:06.200 --> 43:07.760
and others saying,

43:07.840 --> 43:11.000
"He's not the guy."
We weren't sure anymore.

43:11.840 --> 43:15.160
We became doubtful and started thinking
he might not be the killer.

43:17.320 --> 43:20.160
<i>He looked like an average guy,
so I thought he was just a petty criminal.</i>

43:20.240 --> 43:23.120
I did not think
that he could be a murderer.

43:25.160 --> 43:28.400
<i>We totally let our guard down
and wondered if we should let him go.</i>

43:28.480 --> 43:30.200
<i>But I didn't think that at all.</i>

43:32.880 --> 43:34.560
The fact that he brought us here

43:34.640 --> 43:36.280
meant that he was playing with us.

43:36.360 --> 43:39.320
He wanted to test us
to see how much we really knew.

43:40.360 --> 43:44.680
I got so angry
that I slapped him in the face.

43:46.720 --> 43:48.520
Then I said to him, "I'm the boss here.

43:49.520 --> 43:50.920
You can't beat me.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.040
The 120 detectives here are at my command.

43:54.760 --> 43:57.440
I can tell right away.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.120
I know guys like you inside out.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.040
I eat guys like you for breakfast."

44:03.120 --> 44:04.560
When the sun was about to set,

44:04.640 --> 44:06.360
I told the detectives

44:06.440 --> 44:08.720
to take him back
to our investigation room.

44:12.360 --> 44:16.920
<i>The Colonel
of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency</i>

44:17.000 --> 44:20.840
was overseeing all the investigations
in Seoul at the time,

44:20.920 --> 44:22.440
so I had to persuade him first.

44:22.520 --> 44:23.640
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

44:23.720 --> 44:25.600
Let him know that he was the killer

44:25.680 --> 44:27.840
and that everyone else was mistaken.

44:29.720 --> 44:31.920
<i>He was basically giving us the runaround.</i>

44:35.400 --> 44:38.240
So we brought him back
to the investigation room, sat him down,

44:39.000 --> 44:41.480
and tried to get a confession out of him.
"Hey, why did you do that?"

44:41.560 --> 44:44.080
One of the detectives was trying
to get him to confess,

44:44.680 --> 44:46.760
but he suddenly went into a seizure.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.880
An epileptic seizure.

44:52.720 --> 44:55.760
He suddenly started foaming
at the mouth and collapsed.

44:58.720 --> 45:01.400
He went into a seizure
and asked us to uncuff him.

45:02.040 --> 45:05.720
He was showing symptoms of epilepsy,
which could lead to trouble,

45:05.800 --> 45:07.440
so we uncuffed him and sat him down.

45:09.280 --> 45:12.320
<i>We took him to the interrogation room
with another detective later.</i>

45:13.600 --> 45:16.400
We used a laptop for the interrogation.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.400
This detective should have stayed

45:22.480 --> 45:24.840
in the room with him when I left, but…

45:28.120 --> 45:31.080
When I stepped out, he followed me out.

45:33.360 --> 45:37.160
<i>Then he started following me,
but I had no idea.</i>

45:37.240 --> 45:39.640
The detective thought
I had taken him with me.

45:39.720 --> 45:46.720
We had steel gates
that were made to close automatically.

45:46.800 --> 45:48.880
So the doors automatically closed.

45:49.920 --> 45:52.880
<i>He was left alone in the corridor,
so he ran down the stairs.</i>

45:55.320 --> 45:57.760
I came right back
and saw that he was gone.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.760
So I was like, "Where did he go?"
Detective Kim said, "You didn't take him?"

45:59.840 --> 46:01.240
I said, "No, I didn't."

46:04.920 --> 46:06.400
"Shoot. He's escaped."

46:07.480 --> 46:09.920
JULY 16, 2004

46:12.120 --> 46:14.880
At that moment,
two thoughts ran through my head.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.880
Initially, he said
he had killed 30 people.

46:22.120 --> 46:24.160
So I thought he went to kill more people.

46:25.200 --> 46:27.040
<i>He'll take another innocent life.</i>

46:27.800 --> 46:29.400
<i>That thought frightened me.</i>

46:34.080 --> 46:36.120
He toyed with the police.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.920
It was like a testimony
of police incompetence.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.160
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

46:40.240 --> 46:44.560
<i>The entire unit could have been
shut down because of that.</i>

46:46.400 --> 46:48.080
<i>I'd be dismissed too, of course.</i>

46:48.880 --> 46:52.040
And the rain was pouring down.
It was like a scene from a movie.

46:53.240 --> 46:55.880
I lay down on the floor to think.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.960
I lay down with my limbs spread out.

47:03.400 --> 47:06.360
<i>Even if I had been released
and won the lottery,</i>

47:06.920 --> 47:09.160
<i>I probably wouldn't have stopped
murdering people.</i>

47:11.160 --> 47:15.160
<i>Rather,</i> <i>I would have built
a perfect hideout with that money</i>

47:15.240 --> 47:17.160
<i>to achieve my goal.</i>

47:45.960 --> 47:50.960
