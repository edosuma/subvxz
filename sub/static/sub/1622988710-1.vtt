We'll just have to
go when it's dark,

and push the golf cart
across the golf course
and sink it into the lake.

in the driveway or something.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.853
I know what I saw, it wasn't
a guy floating for fun,

13:30.897 --> 13:33.247
looking at the stars,
wearing a dress suit.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.250
Dude, I can't believe it.
That's my first dead body. It--

13:36.293 --> 13:38.339
He looked like a bloated fish,

13:38.382 --> 13:40.167
it's way scarier
than in the video games.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.082
-We have to call
the police.
-No!

13:42.125 --> 13:46.477
-Yes.
-No. [panting]
I can't be a part of this.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.305
-My dad would kill me.
-But we got to.

13:48.349 --> 13:52.570
No, it's true. We don't know
how or why he got in there.

13:52.614 --> 13:55.138
Please, I just want to forget
all about it. [whimpers]

13:55.182 --> 13:57.271
Babe, I really don't think
that's a good idea right now.

13:57.314 --> 14:00.361
-I agree with Dalton.
-Please, Dalton,
just take me home.

14:00.404 --> 14:01.971
I'm with Aubrey
on this one, guys.

14:02.015 --> 14:03.625
Aubrey, you're wet and shaking.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.192
No, please, just take me home.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.237
-I'm done.
-She's right.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.283
We should all just go home.

14:09.326 --> 14:10.980
There's not really much
we can do for that guy.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.677
[stutters] If we just
leave it here,

14:12.721 --> 14:14.201
tomorrow morning
one of the morning walkers,

14:14.244 --> 14:15.898
they'll find him,
and they'll report him.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.073
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.379
-[Aubrey coughs]
-Sure.

14:18.422 --> 14:19.380
Okay, we can do that.

14:21.034 --> 14:23.601
You guys okay? You took off
so fast in the dark.

14:23.645 --> 14:26.169
We couldn't see you.
What happened?

14:26.213 --> 14:29.694
It's, uh, hard to believe,
but we're fine.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.262
-We're all fine.
-Speak for yourself, Charlotte.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.047
Take me home. I'm in shock.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.790
It's crazy
what I'll do for a girl.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.968
We got to get you home. Come on.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.101
Please, just let her
ride with you.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.929
Me, Finn and Charlotte,
we can run back.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.889
[Aubrey whimpering]

14:49.932 --> 14:54.502
Listen, I-- I'll talk to
you two tomorrow morning
at the-- at the park.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.851
[Scarlet]
Okay, sounds good.

15:03.511 --> 15:07.558
[police siren wailing]

15:13.173 --> 15:15.044
Oh, good morning, sunshine!

15:15.088 --> 15:17.307
Hey, Mom. Hey, Brynn.

15:17.351 --> 15:20.223
-What? No church today?
-No, we've got Brynn visiting.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.312
I thought we'd just
take it easy this morning.

15:22.356 --> 15:25.228
But, uh, don't we have
to take the food donations in?

15:25.272 --> 15:27.056
[Helen]
Oh, we can take it tomorrow.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.580
Besides, I think
Aubrey was up late last night.

15:29.624 --> 15:32.670
She's probably gonna sleep
till noon, so, come on up,
I've got breakfast, though.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.585
And ride my bikes?

15:34.629 --> 15:37.023
-Not today, Brynn.
-Why not?

15:37.066 --> 15:38.676
Yeah, why not?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.765
Please, ride bikes with Brynn.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.463
I don't think I'll have time.

15:42.506 --> 15:45.727
Then make the time. You know
how much she adores you.

15:45.770 --> 15:49.383
Alright. But I got to see
Scarlet and Roxi at the park
this morning at ten.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.341
-Is lunchtime okay?
-Yeah. Great.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.257
Oh, you know what? You should
ask Grant to join you.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.956
I haven't seen him
around here in so long.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.697
Mom, I don't even hang out
with Grant anymore.

15:59.741 --> 16:02.874
Oh. Well, that's a shame,
you two were such good friends.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.966
Mom? Uh... Mom.

16:07.009 --> 16:07.967
Yeah, honey.

16:09.229 --> 16:13.320
Dad's cart. I, uh,
I think it was stolen.

16:13.363 --> 16:15.844
[chuckles] Oh, honey,
why would you say that?

16:15.887 --> 16:19.630
-Have you checked
the utility room?
-Of course, it's not there.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.719
Well, it's probably
up on the driveway.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.983
You know, Aubrey's always
leaving it out up there.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.159
Yeah, I-- I checked there too.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.812
I'm telling you, it's gone.

16:28.726 --> 16:29.727
Oh, no.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.559
Let's go, buddy.
Let's go, buddy. Let's go.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.213
Oh. Hey.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.394
I can't believe it.
That's so terrible.

16:44.438 --> 16:47.745
I know our neighborhood
is filled with drama,
but that's just so unreal.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.921
[Scarlet]
Oh, my poor Cal.

16:49.965 --> 16:53.012
I mean, he was really,
really shaken up last night.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.449
He didn't say anything to me
on his way home.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.146
Were his parents
waiting up for him?

16:57.190 --> 17:00.062
His mom was,
but his dad's out of town.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.543
I'm sure he doesn't want them
to know anything.

17:02.586 --> 17:06.460
I heard the siren this morning
and saw Chief Bud racing
into the neighborhood.

17:06.502 --> 17:09.202
I just figured some old person
had a heart attack.

17:09.244 --> 17:11.030
Poor Aubrey.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.944
Yeah, she was... She was
pretty shaken up about it.

17:13.989 --> 17:17.471
Wow. Your plan just got
a lot more complicated.

17:17.513 --> 17:19.951
Yeah. This is serious.

17:19.994 --> 17:22.824
Now your cart's
linked to a dead guy.

17:22.867 --> 17:26.348
You're right!
I didn't even think about that.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.395
Oh, what have we done?

17:28.438 --> 17:31.093
So, your mom reported
the cart as stolen?

17:31.137 --> 17:34.401
I assume she will.
After she talks to Aubrey.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.011
Well, that's good.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.928
We got to find out what Chief
Bud thinks about the scene.

17:39.971 --> 17:42.626
Cal's dad says
Chief Bud is ROAD.

17:42.670 --> 17:43.671
-ROAD?
-ROAD?

17:44.933 --> 17:48.197
Retired on active duty.
It's military slang.

17:48.241 --> 17:50.765
But my cousin Tanner
still respects him a lot.

17:50.808 --> 17:54.247
He says
he really knows his stuff
after 30 years of policing.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.119
Yeah, I remember Tanner.

17:57.163 --> 18:00.427
Damn. I bet
he looks good in uniform.

18:00.470 --> 18:03.343
-[laughs]
-Y'all have got to calm down.

18:03.386 --> 18:04.953
He's like a brother to me.

18:04.996 --> 18:07.260
[sighs] Alright. There's what?

18:07.303 --> 18:11.699
Like, five people staffed there?
I bet it's like a fish bowl.

18:11.742 --> 18:14.745
Scarlet, do you think you could
talk to Tanner this afternoon

18:14.789 --> 18:16.486
and see what you can find out?

18:16.530 --> 18:19.750
Yeah, um, I can make him
some of my lemon pound cake.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.404
That'll get him talking.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.363
Oh, also,

18:23.406 --> 18:26.148
he told me the medical examiner
is a little sweet on him.

18:26.192 --> 18:29.369
So that might help us
get some answers.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.719
Great. I'll see you guys later.

18:31.762 --> 18:32.720
-Bye.
-Bye.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.158
I'm totally coming
with you to see Tanner.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.378
[both chuckle]

18:46.647 --> 18:49.650
-Morning, Helen.
-[Helen] Oh, Chief Bud!

18:49.693 --> 18:51.478
You're not at church with Bunny?

18:51.521 --> 18:53.306
No, it's been a busy morning.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.177
Choir is gonna have
to do without me today.

18:56.178 --> 19:00.095
Dixie radioed me and tells me
your golf cart's gone missing.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.097
Yes. And I can't
believe it. I mean,

19:02.141 --> 19:04.795
I've never heard of anything
like that happening around here.

19:04.839 --> 19:08.799
Well, it's rare,
but sometimes things do have
a way of wandering off.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.149
When's the last time you saw it?

19:11.715 --> 19:14.544
Oh, well, Jack's out of town.
Of course, I don't use it.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.546
Um, the girls like
to use it though, actually,

19:16.590 --> 19:18.809
Aubrey was the last one
to use it a couple days ago.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.985
She said she left it
parked in the driveway.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.509
Is that right? You were driving?

19:22.552 --> 19:23.640
Yes.

19:25.076 --> 19:27.862
And when you parked it,
you left the key in it?

19:27.905 --> 19:29.951
Yeah. I mean,
we always leave the key in it.

19:29.994 --> 19:32.910
I was gonna move it down to
the utility room in the morning.

19:32.954 --> 19:36.044
And you didn't think about it
at all yesterday?

19:36.087 --> 19:40.788
Um, no, actually
I forgot all about it.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.574
-So you figure it's
been missing over 24 hours?
-Yeah.

19:44.618 --> 19:47.838
-Charlotte noticed
it was gone this morning.
-[Bud] Mm-hmm.

19:47.882 --> 19:51.233
-What does it look like?
-[Helen] Uh, well, it's white.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.888
It has Carolina Panthers
stickers on it.

19:53.931 --> 19:56.847
[chuckles] You know, Jackie
just loves his football.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.154
Well, I think I already
found it this morning.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.505
Oh, that's wonderful.
You know, I just figured
some kids took a joyriding.

20:02.549 --> 20:05.682
-Probably hadn't gone far.
-No, no, it didn't.

20:05.726 --> 20:09.338
But it looks like
it might have been involved
in a bit of an incident.

20:09.382 --> 20:12.602
So, I have to hold on to it
for a few days.

20:12.646 --> 20:15.649
Oh, it's nothing serious,
I hope.

20:15.692 --> 20:18.826
-[Dixie on radio]
Chief Bud, you there?
-Yes, Dixie. I'm here.

20:20.784 --> 20:24.397
[Dixie on radio]
Bunny called. She said you left
your cell phone at home again.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.616
She wants you to pick up
some vanilla wafers

20:26.660 --> 20:29.315
with a banana pudding
on your way home.

20:29.358 --> 20:30.968
Alrighty, darling. Will do.

20:33.406 --> 20:37.061
I'm not sure what to make of
what happened to your cart
right now.

20:37.105 --> 20:40.804
But when Jack gets back,
just have him give me a call.

20:40.848 --> 20:43.764
That's all for now.
You all have a nice day.

20:43.807 --> 20:46.201
Alright, Chief Bud. Thank you!

20:48.203 --> 20:50.292
Mom? You okay?

20:50.336 --> 20:51.728
Oh, yeah.

20:53.643 --> 20:56.777
I guess we'll just have to start
locking things up around here.

21:03.087 --> 21:06.003
[birds chirping]

21:06.047 --> 21:09.050
[footsteps approaching]

21:09.093 --> 21:12.532
-Hey, Tanner.
-Hey, baby girl, how are you?

21:12.575 --> 21:14.360
I'm good. How's your mama?

21:14.403 --> 21:18.538
Oh, you know her. Stirring
the pot around town as usual.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.322
Do you remember my friend Roxi?

21:20.366 --> 21:23.369
Yes, ma'am.
How are you doing, Miss Roxie?

21:23.412 --> 21:25.806
Hotter than ever. Ooh!

21:25.849 --> 21:30.941
[chuckles] Well, if you mean
the weather, it is, um, humid.

21:30.985 --> 21:33.379
[chuckles softly]
So what'd you bring me?

21:33.422 --> 21:35.468
You know I'm a slave
to your baking talent.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.513
Your favorite, lemon pound cake.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.210
Oh, yes. [chuckles]

21:41.082 --> 21:42.997
[sighs]

21:43.040 --> 21:44.781
Hello, Officer Hart.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.653
Looks like you have
some good company today.

21:46.696 --> 21:48.481
Good afternoon, ma'am.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.787
-You're working on a Sunday?
-Oh, no, not really.

21:50.831 --> 21:54.574
I just remembered something
that I needed to talk
to Chief Bud about.

21:54.617 --> 21:57.359
Well, I'm sorry,
he's not here right now. Uh...

21:57.403 --> 22:01.668
-Can I help you?
-Oh, gosh, no. No, thank you.

22:03.234 --> 22:06.368
I'm Scarlet, Tanner's cousin.
This is my friend Roxi.

22:06.412 --> 22:09.415
Oh! Hello! Dr. Sarah Owens.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.547
The county's
new medical examiner.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.375
So nice to meet both of you.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.377
Would you like to have some
lemonade and cake with us?

22:15.421 --> 22:17.510
Oh, gosh, I couldn't.

22:17.553 --> 22:20.251
But, uh-- but thank you
so much. [chuckles]

22:20.295 --> 22:21.470
[chuckles softly]

22:22.819 --> 22:24.560
You just got some, uh...

22:25.648 --> 22:28.085
...some feather. Right here.

22:28.129 --> 22:31.872
Oh! Oh my. How embarrassing.

22:31.915 --> 22:37.181
Thank you. Um... [stutters]
I'll be back... tomorrow.

22:37.225 --> 22:39.488
-Have a good day, Doctor Owens.
-Bye.

22:39.532 --> 22:43.057
[birds chirping]

22:45.189 --> 22:50.934
So... [sighs] you mentioned
I had to earn your cake.

22:52.501 --> 22:54.198
What is it you want exactly?

22:54.242 --> 22:56.026
Nothing big.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.941
Just a little information

22:57.985 --> 23:00.944
-on a recent death
in my neighborhood.
-Uh-huh.

23:00.988 --> 23:03.686
You mean
the demise of Harley Trudeau.

23:03.730 --> 23:06.733
Well, it is the talk
of the town in the station.

23:06.776 --> 23:09.126
Well then, I'm sure
it's not hard to hear

23:09.170 --> 23:12.086
a few tidbits in that
tiny office you all share?

23:12.129 --> 23:13.653
True.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.132
So, what's on your mind?

23:15.176 --> 23:18.788
Well, we're wondering
what killed him.

23:18.832 --> 23:22.270
Is it natural or otherwise?

23:22.313 --> 23:25.404
Yeah, so weird him dying out
on the golf course

23:25.447 --> 23:26.579
in the middle of the night.

23:29.625 --> 23:33.194
What morbidly curious minds
you do have, little ladies.

23:33.237 --> 23:37.241
[chuckles] I like it,
but it's gonna cost you.

23:39.069 --> 23:42.072
This pound cake, a...

23:43.073 --> 23:46.860
...peach cobbler next week and
a pecan pie the week after that.

23:46.903 --> 23:50.080
And I want a free
cup of coffee every day.

23:50.124 --> 23:53.606
Miss Roxie is working
from that Java joint
until the end of that period.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.477
[inhales]

23:55.521 --> 23:57.697
Mm. Agreed?

24:01.004 --> 24:03.224
Drive a hard bargain,
Officer Hart.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.967
-Agreed.
-[chuckles]

24:08.447 --> 24:11.493
Yay! Call me later
with the details.

24:11.537 --> 24:15.715
You've been saying that medical
examiner lady is sweet on you,
it shouldn't be hard.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.456
Alright now. Never you mind.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.720
[Tanner]
Oh, I got my ways.

24:22.112 --> 24:24.463
Y'all stay out of trouble now.
Alright?

24:24.506 --> 24:25.855
Oh, we will.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.204
-Bye.
-Bye.

24:27.248 --> 24:28.162
Bye.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.645
Hey, what you got?

24:32.688 --> 24:35.517
Oh, no. Hands off. Hands off.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.302
You're like a vacuum, Em.
Don't you dare, don't you dare.

24:38.346 --> 24:40.740
Come on, share.

24:40.783 --> 24:43.394
Why do you always get
the goodies and the girls?

24:43.438 --> 24:47.181
-Poor Em gets nothing!
Don't you feel sad for me?
-[sighs]

24:47.224 --> 24:50.663
Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I do feel sorry for you

24:50.706 --> 24:55.102
all the time, because you're
nothing but a pathetic beggar.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.104
And don't you be eyeballing
those girls, alright?

24:57.147 --> 24:59.759
-That's my cousin
and her friend.
-Oh, I know that.

24:59.802 --> 25:01.282
Well, they're just kids.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.545
Jeez, what kind of person
do you think I am?

25:03.589 --> 25:05.547
I'm not talking
about them either.

25:05.591 --> 25:08.681
I'm talking about
proper young ladies
that come around here.

25:08.724 --> 25:11.161
You're always catching
their eyes, and I'm just like

25:11.205 --> 25:13.424
grandma's wallpaper,
just kind of hanging there.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.339
Alright. Alright.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.428
You can have a piece of cake.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.735
Just quit whining.
You're ruining my appetite.

25:19.779 --> 25:20.867
Would you open the door?

25:23.522 --> 25:24.958
Where's Cal?

25:25.001 --> 25:27.003
He doesn't want
to join our roundtable?

25:27.047 --> 25:29.353
No. He's sticking
close to home these days.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.573
His mom was pretty upset
he was out so late.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.967
I think he's grounded.
He couldn't talk when I called.

25:34.010 --> 25:37.579
Oh, no boyf' for a few days?
How will you survive?

25:37.623 --> 25:39.842
Don't tease me, Roxi.

25:39.886 --> 25:42.758
He had a traumatic experience
and I wasn't there
to hug him through it.

25:42.802 --> 25:45.805
You can give me a hug
if you want. I'm short of hugs.

25:45.848 --> 25:48.242
Actually, I'm pretty sure
my hug jar is empty.

25:48.285 --> 25:51.201
Finn, you desire
actual human contact?

25:51.245 --> 25:53.682
[laughs] Ouch!

25:53.726 --> 25:55.075
Hilarious, Roxi.

25:56.206 --> 25:57.947
Oh, get this.

25:57.991 --> 26:02.125
Dish is, the victim,
is Harley Trudeau.

26:03.039 --> 26:04.867
The notorious lawyer
on fourth floor?

26:04.911 --> 26:06.521
It didn't look like him
in the pond.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.045
That's because his face
is all frozen like...

26:09.089 --> 26:11.787
Oh, come on.
His face wasn't that bad.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.223
Okay. That is not funny.

26:13.267 --> 26:14.573
That was the most
horrific experience

26:14.616 --> 26:16.531
I've ever had in my life, okay?

26:16.575 --> 26:19.403
And I saw the Sawmovies.
It's different when it's real.

26:19.447 --> 26:23.494
Come on. Can we please just
remember that Aubrey, you...

26:24.452 --> 26:27.542
...correction, "we" are
in big, big trouble here.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.894
-What else did you find out?
-Tanner said the victim is
in his early sixties,

26:31.938 --> 26:35.550
obese and known to be
a heavy smoker and drinker.

26:35.594 --> 26:40.424
Also, his body is believed
to have wounds from both
strangulation and hit and run.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.426
-[gasps]
-[Scarlet] Yeah.

26:42.470 --> 26:45.081
So, the golf cart,

26:45.125 --> 26:49.303
your golf cart is what Chief Bud
thinks he was hit with.

26:49.346 --> 26:52.654
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.
This is what I get for lying!

26:52.698 --> 26:56.571
Chief Bud is probably wondering
if the driver was Aubrey
or a thief, right?

26:56.615 --> 26:59.574
He doesn't know for sure,
or else Aubrey would
already be arrested.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.881
Oh, gracious.
I'm going to the big house.

27:01.924 --> 27:04.187
No, no, no, no, no, come on.

27:04.231 --> 27:06.015
I'm sure that's not the case.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.452
I mean, Chief Bud knows
our family from church,

27:08.496 --> 27:10.585
so that probably helps.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.327
And it'll take him a few days
to come to his final decision.

27:15.329 --> 27:18.811
So... all we need to do is

27:18.854 --> 27:21.335
figure out who killed
Harley Trudeau

27:21.378 --> 27:23.598
before Chief Bud can
jump to the wrong conclusion.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.644
No, we have to tell the truth.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.994
Giving my college money
to your dad to fix the cart

27:28.037 --> 27:32.302
is better than going
to prison for murder
and then getting f'ed there.

27:32.346 --> 27:35.131
You know what? I know
when it's time to get out,

27:35.175 --> 27:37.438
and that time is now.

27:37.481 --> 27:42.573
But I'm sorry, Char, but fight
or flight, I gotta fly. Later.

27:42.617 --> 27:46.752
Finn, come on,
we can do this. Guys?

27:46.795 --> 27:49.711
It's not over
till the fat lady sings.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.671
Or until one of us
gets arrested, but...

27:52.714 --> 27:54.324
...three days is all I'm asking.

27:56.239 --> 27:59.329
Chief Bud is gonna need
some time to conduct
his investigation, right?

27:59.373 --> 28:00.287
Who's with me?

28:01.418 --> 28:03.464
-I am.
-I am.

28:04.465 --> 28:06.641
-We are.
-Okay. We're in.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.774
So, where do we start?

28:11.907 --> 28:13.735
[sighs]

28:13.779 --> 28:16.956
-You sure this is
the Trudeau House.
-Yep.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.741
I don't see any other cars,
except for Harley's Jag,

28:19.785 --> 28:21.917
I don't see their cart either.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.702
Maybe she's just out to dinner.

28:23.745 --> 28:27.183
Yeah. We should just probably
wait it out for a bit.

28:27.227 --> 28:28.532
[sighs] I agree.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.591
Do I hear someone coming?

28:43.634 --> 28:45.071
No, that's probably fine.

28:50.598 --> 28:52.861
Well, that-- I guess
that could be--

28:52.905 --> 28:55.429
[whispering] Oh, well, they're
coming this way, get down.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.131
You think he saw us?

29:02.175 --> 29:03.829
No, I don't think so. That's--

29:03.872 --> 29:05.569
That's Larson, her son,
but I mean,

29:05.613 --> 29:07.136
he doesn't live at home anymore.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.137
[Aubrey]
What is he doing here?

29:08.181 --> 29:09.530
I don't know.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.359
-Let's go check it out.
-Okay.

29:40.256 --> 29:42.781
[footsteps approaching]

29:52.442 --> 29:54.575
-Can you see him?
-Oh, my gosh. There he is.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.840
[whispering] I don't think
he saw us yet.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.755
Okay. He's right there.
He's right there.

30:04.672 --> 30:07.022
Shoot! Someone's coming.
Come on, come on,
let's go. Come on.

30:21.297 --> 30:24.561
[whispering] Get down, get down.
Shh. I don't want my son to see.

30:26.999 --> 30:28.957
I'll be right back, sweetheart.

30:29.001 --> 30:29.958
Be right back.

30:37.531 --> 30:38.967
-[Larson] Where is it?
-[Winona] Where's what?

30:39.011 --> 30:40.055
[Larson]
Where's Dad's will?

30:40.099 --> 30:41.230
I know you know where it is.

30:43.102 --> 30:46.061
[indistinct chatter]

30:46.975 --> 30:48.759
[Aubrey]
Who is that guy?

30:48.803 --> 30:51.284
That's Foster, he's one
of the bartenders at the club.

30:52.154 --> 30:54.635
-What is he doing here?
-I don't know.

30:55.941 --> 30:59.292
-[Larson] You know what, you're
worthless. Just forget it!
-[Winona] Sweetheart.

31:00.989 --> 31:03.513
Oh, yeah. Just go to
your little, happy place, your--

31:03.557 --> 31:05.254
Whatever it is
you do these days.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.784
Dad's always been
an asshole to me.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.048
The least you can do
is go find that will.

31:19.703 --> 31:20.835
When I get home...

31:21.880 --> 31:23.446
...they'll be on my side.

31:33.021 --> 31:36.242
Come here, sugar.
It's time to play.

31:37.330 --> 31:38.722
Oh, my goodness.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.507
Did I see what
I thought I just saw?

31:40.550 --> 31:42.770
[chuckles] I think so.

31:42.813 --> 31:45.033
Mrs. Trudeau
doesn't seem too bereaved.

31:50.691 --> 31:51.953
[whispering] Alright. Let's go.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.915
[Aubrey]
Alright. Let me see
what's going on here.

31:58.960 --> 32:02.268
-Can you see them?
-[Aubrey] Not yet.

32:02.311 --> 32:03.747
Oh, there's Foster.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.881
Alright. What is he up to?

32:10.319 --> 32:12.539
-[Dalton] What's he doing?
-[Aubrey] Oh.

32:12.582 --> 32:15.107
It looks like, um,
he's making them some drinks.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.369
Alright.

32:17.674 --> 32:19.459
[sighs] Where's Mrs. Trudeau?

32:21.026 --> 32:22.375
Oh, there she is!

32:23.332 --> 32:25.900
Looks like she's
in some sort of robe.

32:25.944 --> 32:26.945
Okay.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.469
Alright.

32:32.298 --> 32:36.606
Oh, looks like some
swaying and canoodling.

32:36.650 --> 32:39.566
-Canoodling?
-You know, like fun cuddling.

32:39.609 --> 32:40.828
Just let me see.

32:45.311 --> 32:46.355
Oh.

32:48.618 --> 32:52.144
"Hello, bartender.
It's ever so hot.

32:52.187 --> 32:54.537
I'm burning up
just looking at you."

32:54.581 --> 32:56.975
"Oh, why yes, Mrs. Trudeau?

32:57.018 --> 33:00.152
I've got exactly
what you're thirsty for."

33:00.195 --> 33:03.851
"Oh, perfect.
But please call me Winona."

33:03.894 --> 33:05.853
Stop!

33:05.896 --> 33:07.376
Alright.

33:07.420 --> 33:10.336
Oh. Oh, jeez.

33:10.379 --> 33:11.815
She's really going for it.

33:13.165 --> 33:14.818
Oh, I don't think
I can watch this.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.778
I feel like
an unfortunate fly on the wall.

33:17.821 --> 33:19.606
-Let me see.
-No. No!

33:19.649 --> 33:21.521
-Dalton!
-I just don't want you
to see that.

33:21.564 --> 33:22.696
Just let me see.

33:24.915 --> 33:25.786
Oh.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.658
Yeah. Okay.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.617
Um, let's just get out of here,

33:30.660 --> 33:33.576
and you can check up on her
in the morning. Alright.

33:47.590 --> 33:48.678
[rock hits the window]

33:52.117 --> 33:53.031
[rock hits the window]

33:57.905 --> 33:59.037
[rock hits the window]

34:02.040 --> 34:04.346
[Grant whispering]
Hey. Did I wake you?

34:04.390 --> 34:06.609
No. What are you
doing here, Grant?

34:06.653 --> 34:09.177
I don't think you've thrown
rocks at my window
since we were, like, ten.

34:09.221 --> 34:10.918
I just want to talk.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.746
Cal said you are in trouble
but he won't say what.

34:13.790 --> 34:16.228
[scoffs] We're fine.
We're fixing it.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.186
You tell Cal to shut up!

34:19.187 --> 34:20.971
Come on. Why don't you trust me?

34:21.014 --> 34:23.277
I mean, we've been friends
since the fourth grade,

34:23.322 --> 34:25.498
and ever since we hit, like,

34:25.541 --> 34:27.587
puberty, you just
stopped talking to me.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.154
Come on, Charlotte.
What's going on?

34:29.197 --> 34:33.592
No, Grant. I don't need you.
Now go home!

34:33.636 --> 34:36.161
Charlotte! Charlotte!

34:37.945 --> 34:39.947
Charlotte Margaret Moon!

34:39.989 --> 34:43.123
Grant, only my mother
calls me by my full name.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.516
Now go home.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.693
-But--
-Go home.

34:55.614 --> 34:57.269
-Did you take your medicine?
-Yes.

34:57.312 --> 35:00.141
Alright, good. Uh, bathroom.
Did you use the bathroom?

35:00.185 --> 35:02.012
-Yeah.
-Alright.

35:02.056 --> 35:03.884
-[unintelligible yelling]
-Do you need some help?

35:03.927 --> 35:06.278
-[mumbles]
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

35:20.379 --> 35:23.947
[mischievous music]

35:40.834 --> 35:41.878
[pants]

35:43.706 --> 35:44.925
Alright. That's good.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.494
Oh, oh.

35:48.537 --> 35:49.582
[grunts]

35:56.719 --> 36:00.462
-[Brynn mumbles]
-Alright. Let's, uh,
let's sit here for a second.

36:02.421 --> 36:03.378
Brynn.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.555
-Do you have your drink?
-Yes.

36:06.599 --> 36:08.383
Alright, good.

36:08.427 --> 36:10.211
I'm, uh, I'm gonna go
look at something real quick.

36:10.255 --> 36:13.780
-You... find some bugs.
-Okay.

36:18.872 --> 36:22.528
[mischievous music continues]

37:03.743 --> 37:06.354
Charlotte, what are you doing?

37:06.398 --> 37:08.226
I'm, uh, looking for bugs.

37:09.314 --> 37:10.663
Looks like there's none here.

37:11.925 --> 37:13.883
Come on, Brynn. Let's, uh,

37:13.927 --> 37:16.016
let's go look someplace else.

37:16.059 --> 37:19.889
Here, you can use
your binoculars
and look for some birds.

37:19.933 --> 37:21.717
-Okay.
-Alright.

37:21.761 --> 37:24.590
Just, uh, stay here
and I'll be right back.

37:28.376 --> 37:33.076
[mischievous music continues]

37:38.299 --> 37:39.257
[groans]

38:16.685 --> 38:18.818
You are so silly.

38:18.861 --> 38:20.515
[Charlotte]
Brynn, stay hidden.

38:20.559 --> 38:23.301
-You don't want
to scare the bugs.
-What?

38:23.344 --> 38:25.215
[Charlotte]
Brynn, uh, hand me your spade.

38:26.086 --> 38:27.870
The-- the tiny shovel
in your hand.

38:27.914 --> 38:29.176
Give it to me.

38:29.219 --> 38:30.133
Come on.

38:33.659 --> 38:34.964
Careful, careful.

38:35.008 --> 38:38.054
[mischievous music continues]

39:26.320 --> 39:27.277
Okay.

39:29.584 --> 39:31.543
Alright, Brynn. It's time to go.

40:00.006 --> 40:01.268
Mm.

40:35.520 --> 40:40.394
[peeing]

41:17.910 --> 41:19.999
Well, hello there.

41:20.042 --> 41:23.089
Usually it's older men
on the golf course
staring in my windows.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.700
But this is a nice surprise.

41:25.744 --> 41:27.833
Have you come here
to comfort me?

41:28.790 --> 41:31.097
I'm flattered.

41:31.140 --> 41:35.362
Usually I like a younger man's
attention, but, uh...

41:35.405 --> 41:39.932
...I think you might be
a little bit too young for me.

41:39.975 --> 41:42.064
Now, shoot before
I call your parents

41:42.108 --> 41:44.545
and tell them
what their precious little,
baby boy has been up to.

41:49.028 --> 41:50.899
[woman]
Don't tell me
there's such a thing.

41:53.423 --> 41:55.382
You mean the kind of like...

41:56.296 --> 42:01.214
[indistinct chatter]

42:02.824 --> 42:04.434
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Carver.

42:05.610 --> 42:08.003
Good morning,
Judge Talbott, Mrs. Talbott.

42:08.047 --> 42:09.614
Ms. Wyatt, I love your hat.

42:13.052 --> 42:14.836
Is there anyone here
you don't know?

42:14.880 --> 42:17.883
Very few. But if your family
lived here as long as mine,

42:17.926 --> 42:21.234
you'd know everyone too,
or at least their business.

42:21.277 --> 42:22.888
Alright, well,
I'll be right back.

42:22.931 --> 42:24.672
I'm going to go
to the bathroom. Okay?

42:25.978 --> 42:29.459
-Hey, Sullivan. Hey, Birdie.
-Hi, Scarlet.

42:29.503 --> 42:32.027
I saw your boyfriend
running across the golf course
the other night.

42:32.071 --> 42:34.813
Shh! Don't tell on Cal.

42:34.856 --> 42:35.814
Morning, Mrs. Kelly.

42:37.250 --> 42:39.252
-Hello, Scarlet. How are you?
-[Scarlet] I'm good.

42:39.295 --> 42:40.775
Not sure I'm too hungry though.

42:40.819 --> 42:42.995
Especially after
hearing about Mr. Trudeau.

42:43.038 --> 42:45.737
Oh, I know.
Isn't that just so awful?

42:45.780 --> 42:47.347
Yes. It's hard to believe.

42:47.390 --> 42:49.610
I just feel bad
for Mrs. Trudeau and Larson.

42:51.394 --> 42:54.354
Sullivan, how about you take
Birdie to get some more waffles?

42:54.397 --> 42:56.182
Okay, Mom. Come on, Birdie.

42:56.225 --> 42:58.576
Help me get lots of
whipped cream this time.

43:00.752 --> 43:05.539
-Sadly, I don't think
they'll be missing him much.
-Really?

43:05.583 --> 43:07.846
I'm not saying
Winona did him in.

43:07.889 --> 43:10.544
I think Harley is worth
more to her alive than dead.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.851
But they did
get into it pretty good

43:12.894 --> 43:15.941
at the club's cocktail party
the other evening.

43:15.984 --> 43:18.987
Oh, that party.
It was such a pretty sight.

43:19.031 --> 43:23.296
There were flowers
and candles and garden lights
around the tables.

43:23.339 --> 43:25.777
I took lots of pictures
and I had a--

43:25.820 --> 43:28.823
You were-- you were
saying about the Trudeaus?

43:28.867 --> 43:33.480
Oh, yes. So-- so, toward the end
of the night, um, about ten,

43:33.523 --> 43:37.702
they took off on their golf
cart, just ranting and raving.

43:37.745 --> 43:39.442
From what I hear,

43:39.486 --> 43:43.446
their son Larson is a bit
of a spender and a gambler.

43:43.490 --> 43:46.101
He and his daddy used
to argue quite a bit about it.

43:47.581 --> 43:51.150
Wouldn't surprise me
if Larson did him in.

43:51.193 --> 43:53.326
He's got a temper on him.

43:53.369 --> 43:54.632
Kind of like his daddy.

44:06.818 --> 44:08.341
Hey. I'm back.

44:10.560 --> 44:13.433
I just heard Mrs. Kelly say
she took lots of pictures
of the club cocktail party.

44:13.476 --> 44:14.608
Really?

44:15.696 --> 44:16.654
Mm.

44:19.874 --> 44:20.745
[Scarlet]
Be right back.

44:28.274 --> 44:30.972
[man]
Can you check on--
can you check on my jacket?

44:33.540 --> 44:37.457
[indistinct chatter]

44:55.954 --> 44:56.998
[clears throat]

45:12.797 --> 45:17.192
Well, I for one,
won't be missing that man's
big mouth around the club.

45:17.236 --> 45:18.977
Ranger, my ass.

45:19.020 --> 45:20.892
I don't know, Colonel.

45:20.935 --> 45:22.850
Mr. Trudeau had some
pretty good war stories.

45:23.938 --> 45:27.507
I'm telling you,
there's no way he served.

45:27.550 --> 45:31.511
I served for 30 years. 30 years!

45:31.554 --> 45:34.035
Trust me, he's an impostor.

45:34.906 --> 45:37.038
His tales' as tall as my boat.

45:39.084 --> 45:41.260
I expect you're right, Colonel.

45:41.303 --> 45:43.653
Now, Carlos,
one of the groundskeepers,

45:43.697 --> 45:46.569
says the same thing.
You know he served?

45:46.613 --> 45:49.442
Yes, I do.
Now that's a good soldier.

45:50.791 --> 45:53.446
There's nothing burns me up more

45:53.489 --> 45:55.709
than a prideful bastard

45:55.753 --> 46:00.235
who steals somebody's respect
and glory who rightfully served.

46:01.236 --> 46:04.326
Carlos said he often had
run ins with Mr. Trudeau,

46:04.370 --> 46:06.720
especially at night
on the golf course.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.809
You catch him out there
drinking, pissing,

46:08.853 --> 46:10.811
tosses empties on the greens.

46:10.855 --> 46:13.814
-You believe that?
-Yeah, I believe it.

46:16.948 --> 46:20.734
Why Winona ever hooked up
with a guy like that?

46:22.127 --> 46:23.389
I'd never know.

46:25.391 --> 46:26.784
She deserves better.

46:28.960 --> 46:31.614
I agree, Colonel. I agree.

46:34.487 --> 46:36.228
Let me check
on that breakfast for you.

46:41.886 --> 46:44.192
You are not gonna believe
what I just heard.

46:44.236 --> 46:46.542
Well, you're not gonna
believe what I just did.

46:47.587 --> 46:51.156
I AirDropped her pictures
from the club cocktail party
to my phone.

46:51.199 --> 46:52.940
You are so awesome.

46:52.984 --> 46:55.638
I know. Let's get out of here.

46:55.682 --> 46:57.945
We gotta go visit
my mom at the bank.

46:57.989 --> 47:01.949
[indistinct chatter]

47:01.993 --> 47:06.432
[upbeat music]

47:14.048 --> 47:15.528
Hey, Gina. Going for me?

47:16.572 --> 47:18.183
-No.
-Ouch.

47:22.578 --> 47:23.536
Hey, Char.

47:34.460 --> 47:36.201
Well, hello, lovely lady.

47:36.244 --> 47:39.073
-You come here often?
-Hello, Cal.

47:39.117 --> 47:41.510
Hi, Finn, I see you
both recovered.

47:41.554 --> 47:45.166
Oh, no. The emotional
scars still there.

47:45.210 --> 47:47.690
Well, I'm glad
to hear you're a survivor.

47:47.734 --> 47:50.084
Yeah. And Mom's got me
on a short leash now.

47:50.128 --> 47:52.130
-Thank you very much.
-Yeah.

47:52.173 --> 47:54.872
But I really do
appreciate the sacrifice.

47:54.915 --> 47:57.439
You should, because now he's
grounded from his girlfriend

47:57.483 --> 48:02.009
and other unsuitable
influences...
[coughs] Charlotte.

48:02.053 --> 48:05.883
Uh-huh. Cal,
you have a big mouth.

48:05.926 --> 48:08.537
Yeah, I know.
Anyways, enough chatter.

48:08.581 --> 48:12.454
You want to play some
touch football with us?

48:12.498 --> 48:15.849
No, thanks. I don't want
to touch you at all, you freak.

48:15.893 --> 48:17.503
Anchors aweigh!

48:17.546 --> 48:20.071
-[water splashing]
-Cannonball!

48:23.683 --> 48:26.642
Hey! You know what?
Cal, you're a real gentleman.

48:26.686 --> 48:28.906
Scarlet will be so pleased you
treat her best friend like this.

48:28.949 --> 48:30.690
I don't know why she dates you!

49:03.462 --> 49:06.465
Hey, kid,
you're in my personal space.

49:07.509 --> 49:08.423
Yeah.

49:09.642 --> 49:12.297
-Hey.
-Oh. I don't like.

49:12.340 --> 49:15.778
Hey, don't mind her.
Getting your space is
her way of being friendly.

49:15.822 --> 49:16.954
She's autistic.

49:18.216 --> 49:19.521
Uh-huh.

49:21.045 --> 49:23.047
Hey, Larson.

49:23.090 --> 49:24.874
So, can I get you anything?

49:24.918 --> 49:27.616
-I got soda, beer...
-[Larson] No, thanks.

49:36.016 --> 49:38.410
Oh, you can get me something.

49:39.324 --> 49:41.804
Or am I too poor?

49:54.165 --> 49:55.079
Hello.

49:58.082 --> 49:59.431
I said not to call.

50:02.042 --> 50:03.130
I will get it.

50:04.088 --> 50:05.611
Dude, I will get it.

50:08.005 --> 50:09.267
Stop calling me!

50:20.713 --> 50:22.454
Come on, Jill, let's go.

50:22.497 --> 50:24.412
Babe, we just got here.

50:24.456 --> 50:27.111
-Jill, now, come on, let's go.
-Okay. Just give me one second.

50:29.113 --> 50:30.810
I hate when you're so grouchy.

50:52.049 --> 50:54.094
[exhales] She's fine.

50:54.138 --> 50:55.661
She's tough.

50:55.704 --> 50:58.359
I just took my eyes off her
for a second.

50:58.403 --> 51:00.100
Come on, Brynn.

51:00.144 --> 51:03.669
-Ow!
-It can happen fast.
That's why I'm here.

51:03.712 --> 51:05.105
-Okay.
-[Vonne] Hey. Hey, Brynn.

51:05.149 --> 51:07.281
Uh, you swallowed any water?

51:08.543 --> 51:10.415
-What?
-You swallowed any water?

51:10.458 --> 51:12.808
-No.
-Um...

51:12.852 --> 51:15.028
-What's your name?
-Brynn.

51:15.072 --> 51:16.769
[Vonne]
How many fingers
am I holding up, Brynn?

51:16.812 --> 51:18.771
-Three.
-High five.

51:20.512 --> 51:22.296
[sighs]

51:22.340 --> 51:24.777
Come on, Brynn. I think that's
enough swimming for today.

51:24.820 --> 51:28.476
Hey. When you see Dalton
with your sister,
tell him to call me.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.652
I want to go later for pizza.

51:30.696 --> 51:33.307
That is if you can pull him
somewhere away from
his girlfriend.

51:33.351 --> 51:34.569
Yeah. Okay.

51:38.312 --> 51:40.227
Later, loser!

51:40.271 --> 51:41.620
[Brynn laughs]

51:41.663 --> 51:43.056
-Come on, Brynn.
-[Brynn] Okay.

51:46.233 --> 51:49.018
Wow. Brynn and you were
busy little detectives, huh?

51:49.062 --> 51:51.456
[chuckles] I admit
it was pretty cool.

51:51.499 --> 51:54.502
Uh, this is everyone we have
in our suspect list so far.

51:54.546 --> 51:56.243
[Cal]
Hey, guys.

51:56.287 --> 51:58.158
Did you guys
solve the murder yet?

51:58.202 --> 51:59.725
Glad you could join us, Cal.

51:59.768 --> 52:01.944
I'm on parole.
So, it's good to be here.

52:01.988 --> 52:04.164
Alright. So based on what
I found in the golf course,

52:04.208 --> 52:06.993
it seems that Harley
was killed in the sand trap

52:07.036 --> 52:09.256
and had his body dragged
into the cove.

52:09.300 --> 52:12.346
Yeah, I think you're right.
But who on your list
could have done that?

52:12.390 --> 52:15.088
-Not Winona.
-But Winona has a motive.

52:15.132 --> 52:19.092
We saw her come home
all liquored up and happy
with a bartender from the club.

52:19.136 --> 52:20.876
Yeah, Foster Davis.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.618
-Foster is a friend of Tanner's.
-Mm.

52:24.663 --> 52:26.926
[Roxi]
So, they're having an affair?

52:28.057 --> 52:30.669
Foster is known to be a favorite
with the club cougars.

52:30.712 --> 52:33.889
I think I might be a favorite
with the club cougars.

52:33.933 --> 52:37.154
-Winona caught me outside
her house this morning.
-[all] What?

52:37.197 --> 52:39.417
Yeah, I thought she was
gonna pull Mrs. Robinson on me.

52:39.460 --> 52:42.550
-[girls] Ew!
-Yeah, but she saw me packing
this. It was alright.

52:42.594 --> 52:45.553
That earring that Charlotte
found in the sand trap
could be hers.

52:45.597 --> 52:48.556
Mrs. Kelly doesn't think
Winona would kill Harley.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.558
He was worth more
to her alive than dead.

52:50.602 --> 52:52.081
And it definitely wasn't Foster.

52:52.125 --> 52:53.648
I mean, he might
entertain wealthy women,

52:53.692 --> 52:56.129
but he definitely
would not kill for them.

52:56.173 --> 52:59.480
Well, unless they have alibis,
they're staying on the list.

52:59.524 --> 53:02.527
Ms. Kelly does see
their son Larson doing it.

53:02.570 --> 53:05.704
He's known for his temper
and blowing off his money.

53:05.747 --> 53:08.141
-That earring could
be his fiancée's.
-Yeah.

53:08.185 --> 53:10.926
And the other day at the pool,
I heard him take a phone call.

53:10.970 --> 53:13.712
He seemed really mad about it.
Something about money.

53:13.755 --> 53:16.105
-The Colonel was
mad at brunch today.
-Yeah.

53:16.149 --> 53:20.632
I guess Harley boasted
at the club that he was
a part of the Army Rangers.

53:20.675 --> 53:22.938
The Colonel didn't believe it,
called Harley a liar.

53:22.982 --> 53:25.027
Veterans could take
a serious offense to fakes.

53:25.071 --> 53:28.596
It's called "stolen valor."
It can even get violent.

53:28.640 --> 53:32.383
Well, it sounds like
the Colonel is going to
be added to our list too.

53:32.426 --> 53:34.950
Wait. Well, what about
the fights between Harley

53:34.994 --> 53:37.170
-and the greenskeeper?
-Carlos?

53:37.214 --> 53:39.520
Yeah, he lives in a trailer
behind the ninth hole.

53:39.564 --> 53:43.002
He would have been
on the greens that night
because he patrols it.

53:43.045 --> 53:44.395
I don't see him
killing some rich asshole

53:44.438 --> 53:45.744
just because
he let him get to him.

53:45.787 --> 53:47.789
No. Put him on the list.

53:47.833 --> 53:50.009
There are times
where I'm sneaking across
the golf course at night

53:50.052 --> 53:52.403
to Scarlet's house
and he chases me.

53:52.446 --> 53:54.753
You know, Ms. Kelly said

53:54.796 --> 53:57.930
the Trudeaus were
at the club cocktail party
the night Harley died.

53:57.973 --> 54:01.760
She said they got in a fight
and left together on their
golf cart about ten.

54:01.803 --> 54:04.110
-Oh, I got their party pics.
-Awesome.

54:06.504 --> 54:09.028
Yeah. It looks like
all our suspects were there.

54:10.551 --> 54:13.206
Yeah. And all of them drive
their own carts to the parties.

54:13.250 --> 54:16.818
Yeah, or in Foster's case,
have access to carts.

54:16.862 --> 54:19.691
Scarlet and I went
to my mom's office at the bank.

54:19.734 --> 54:23.260
I'd say Harley doesn't look
like he's hurting for money.

54:23.303 --> 54:27.481
My dad said Harley
and his business partner
had a pretty good relationship.

54:27.525 --> 54:29.875
Alright, we'll take
them off the list for now.

54:32.486 --> 54:35.576
So that leaves us
with Winona, Larson and Jill,

54:35.620 --> 54:37.970
Foster, The Colonel and Carlos.

54:38.013 --> 54:41.408
Well, we do know what time
Harley and Winona
left the party.

54:41.452 --> 54:43.715
Yeah. So, Scarlet,
go back to Ms. Kelly's

54:43.758 --> 54:46.457
and ask her what time all
the other guests left the party.

54:46.500 --> 54:48.676
-Maybe she'll know.
-Oh, she'll know.

54:48.720 --> 54:51.984
When she gets a babysitter, she
stays out as late as she can.

54:52.027 --> 54:55.030
So, we just have to find out
what each suspect was doing

54:55.074 --> 54:57.468
from the time that the Trudeaus
left the party at ten,

54:57.511 --> 55:00.209
and when we found
Harley's body at 12:30.

55:00.253 --> 55:04.475
-Uh, Roxi, do you want
to stake out Carlos with me?
-Sure.

55:04.518 --> 55:07.565
Don't you have a friend
in a lab or something?

55:07.608 --> 55:10.350
Oh, my cousin, Stacy.
She works at a gene lab.

55:10.394 --> 55:12.352
Cool. Do you think
she can run a test on this

55:12.396 --> 55:14.398
and see if it's
a match to Harley?

55:14.441 --> 55:16.400
Sure. She's cool.

55:17.836 --> 55:20.099
And, uh, can you two
follow up on Winona?

55:20.142 --> 55:21.753
Oh, I can't.

55:21.796 --> 55:23.755
I gotta go to the barn
tomorrow and then to work.

55:24.712 --> 55:27.019
Well, I guess
it's just you, Dalton.

55:27.062 --> 55:29.369
-You take Winona.
-Take her where?

55:29.413 --> 55:32.372
Cinderella's ball.
Hello? Are you listening?

55:32.416 --> 55:34.200
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I'm-- I'm just hungry.

55:34.243 --> 55:35.723
I'm actually gonna
go meet Vonne for pizza,

55:35.767 --> 55:37.595
-so I'll see y'all later.
-Wait, Dalton.

55:37.638 --> 55:39.248
I thought we were gonna
get dinner together.

55:39.292 --> 55:40.772
[Dalton]
Oh, no, it's bro time,

55:40.815 --> 55:42.339
and I gotta talk to him
about the Jet Ski.

55:44.428 --> 55:48.040
Can we have snacks at our next
meeting of the minds please?

55:48.083 --> 55:49.955
Hello? Focus!

55:49.998 --> 55:52.784
Alright, I'm-- I'll
take Larson and the fiancée.

55:52.827 --> 55:55.613
Jill works at the wine store
next to the coffee shop.

55:55.656 --> 55:58.093
They come in
after she's done, around two.

55:58.137 --> 56:00.835
Great. Um, I can go over there
and see if they drop any clues.

56:00.879 --> 56:03.708
Scarlet, um, you talk to Tanner,
see if he can, I don't know,

56:03.751 --> 56:06.885
"bro talk" Foster into
telling him what's up
with him and Winona.

56:06.928 --> 56:09.104
Okay, I can talk
to the Colonel too.

56:09.148 --> 56:11.063
-He's friends with my dad.
-Great.

56:11.106 --> 56:13.021
[claps] Excellent, we're done.

56:13.065 --> 56:16.242
Okay. Dance off time,
us two versus you two. You in?

56:16.285 --> 56:18.462
You two are on. Come on, Char.

56:21.595 --> 56:24.642
[upbeat Latin dance music]

56:26.470 --> 56:29.298
Ew. Could you pick
a cleaner hiding spot?

56:29.342 --> 56:31.083
No. We have to hide!

56:31.126 --> 56:33.999
-[groans]
-And, you know,
blend with nature.

56:34.042 --> 56:36.828
Well, I don't want
to be one with nature.

56:36.871 --> 56:38.960
You know nature and I
don't mix very well.

56:39.004 --> 56:41.572
I know, but you're also
one of my very best friends

56:41.615 --> 56:43.878
who'll do anything
to support me.

56:43.922 --> 56:45.053
This is true.

56:47.708 --> 56:51.320
Oh. This maintenance cart
doesn't seem to have
any damage to it.

56:52.626 --> 56:56.021
It is so romantic to see a guy
speaking softly in Spanish.

56:56.935 --> 56:59.633
[singing in Spanish]

56:59.677 --> 57:00.808
Here comes Carlos.

57:02.593 --> 57:05.857
[groans] I can't tell
what he's saying
but he seems really upset.

57:06.901 --> 57:10.601
[speaking in Spanish]

57:10.644 --> 57:14.735
"I'm telling you, man,
stuff keeps going
missing around here."

57:14.779 --> 57:16.476
[speaking in Spanish]

57:16.520 --> 57:19.653
"I get up the next morning,
and more parts are gone."

57:19.697 --> 57:21.481
[Carlos speaking in Spanish]

57:21.525 --> 57:24.571
"I'll never get this Chevy
running again at this rate."

57:24.615 --> 57:26.573
[speaking in Spanish]

57:26.617 --> 57:27.966
"You got to see my golf cart."

57:29.881 --> 57:32.274
[Carlos groans]
Bro...

57:32.318 --> 57:35.669
-[speaking in Spanish]
-[Roxi] "Bro, I'm totally
messed it up."

57:35.713 --> 57:38.106
[speaking in Spanish]

57:38.150 --> 57:40.544
"I hit him so hard.

57:40.587 --> 57:42.763
There was blood everywhere."

57:42.807 --> 57:44.504
Holy sugar, Roxi!

57:46.245 --> 57:49.944
[Latin dance music continues]

57:49.988 --> 57:51.293
-Roxi.
-[groans] Shh!

57:52.425 --> 57:54.471
-[Roxi groans loudly]
-[Charlotte] Roxi!

57:54.514 --> 57:56.995
-Hey!
-We gotta go.

57:57.038 --> 57:58.083
Hey, who's there?

58:00.477 --> 58:03.480
[Latin dance music continues]

58:08.528 --> 58:10.138
-[Charlotte] Hey, Gigi.
-[Roxi] Later, Grant.

58:10.182 --> 58:12.271
I know what
you're up to, Charlotte.

58:12.314 --> 58:14.839
If you think
Cal didn't tell me,
you're crazier than you look.

58:18.277 --> 58:19.713
[both panting]

58:19.757 --> 58:21.367
Carlos made it passed the dog.

58:21.410 --> 58:22.673
-Thank God.
-Good.

58:26.067 --> 58:29.680
-Oh! It's your crush.
-Shh!

58:29.723 --> 58:33.118
Hey, Char.
What are you two doing?

58:33.161 --> 58:34.380
Running from the boogeyman?

58:34.423 --> 58:36.338
[laughs] Good one!

58:36.382 --> 58:37.557
What are you doing around here?

58:37.601 --> 58:38.993
I was just over at Dalton's.

58:39.037 --> 58:41.561
He and I are going in
on a Jet Ski.

58:41.605 --> 58:43.345
Cool. Those are fun.

58:43.389 --> 58:45.652
You want a ride?
Drop you off at Char's house.

58:45.696 --> 58:46.958
Always.

58:49.221 --> 58:52.267
[Latin dance music continues]

59:04.628 --> 59:07.456
Girls. Girls!

59:12.897 --> 59:15.073
-Yeah, Mom?
-Oh, it's almost ten.

59:15.116 --> 59:17.945
I've got to go
show a couple homes,
but I'll be back by lunch.

59:17.989 --> 59:20.034
-Okay, Mom.
-Oh, Charlotte.

59:20.078 --> 59:21.470
While I was at the ship's store,

59:21.514 --> 59:22.689
I signed you up
for sailing lessons.

59:22.733 --> 59:24.169
I mean, they were pretty full,

59:24.212 --> 59:25.736
but they had this
last minute cancellation,

59:25.779 --> 59:27.912
-so I was able to get you in.
-[scoffs] Mom.

59:27.955 --> 59:30.044
What did I tell you
about signing me up for things?

59:30.088 --> 59:31.916
Oh. Come on, Charlotte.

59:31.959 --> 59:33.831
You know
how much I love sailing,

59:33.874 --> 59:35.963
and just like Jane Aubrey,
I want you to learn.

59:36.007 --> 59:38.139
Alright, but am I going
to be in a group lesson

59:38.183 --> 59:39.793
with a bunch of little kids?

59:39.837 --> 59:42.448
Mm. No worries. I signed
you up for private lessons.

59:42.491 --> 59:45.494
Okay. Is, uh, is Jay coming
home for the weekend?

59:45.538 --> 59:46.626
I haven't seen him all summer.

59:46.670 --> 59:48.628
Oh, no, honey,

59:48.672 --> 59:50.761
he's gonna be taking
classes all summer long.

59:50.804 --> 59:52.632
I know you miss him.

59:52.676 --> 59:54.634
Uh, look, I gotta go, okay?

59:54.678 --> 59:57.289
-I love you!
-Bye. I love you too.

59:59.857 --> 1:00:01.815
So glad Mama is gone.

1:00:01.859 --> 1:00:04.731
I don't want to face her until
after this craziness is over.

1:00:04.775 --> 1:00:08.909
Well, that'll be hard.
Mom wants us to go to
the country club's next party.

1:00:08.953 --> 1:00:11.738
Oh, yeah. Dalton promised
we'd go together.

1:00:11.782 --> 1:00:14.915
Lately I think he's been
ditching me a lot,
but hope it will be fun.

1:00:14.959 --> 1:00:16.656
No... [scoffs] it won't.

1:00:16.700 --> 1:00:18.919
Ah, cheer up, sis!

1:00:18.963 --> 1:00:22.531
Oh, um, Carlos chased me
and Roxi last night.

1:00:22.575 --> 1:00:25.360
-He's looking very suspicious.
-He chased you?

1:00:25.404 --> 1:00:26.623
[phone beeping]

1:00:29.582 --> 1:00:32.585
Scarlet texted the list
of the times our suspects
left the party.

1:00:32.629 --> 1:00:35.240
According to Ms. Kelly,
the Trudeaus left about ten.

1:00:35.283 --> 1:00:40.375
The Colonel at 10:30, and Larson
and his fiancée around 10:45.

1:00:40.419 --> 1:00:42.900
Mrs. Kelly stayed
till the party ended at 11.

1:00:42.943 --> 1:00:44.815
And as she was walking home,
she saw Foster

1:00:44.858 --> 1:00:47.295
driving out of the neighborhood
about 11:15.

1:00:47.339 --> 1:00:50.472
So, does that mean
Foster is off the suspect list?

1:00:50.516 --> 1:00:53.258
No, because
he just could come back.

1:00:53.301 --> 1:00:56.043
Hopefully Tanner has
something to tell us today.

1:00:56.087 --> 1:00:58.263
Well, tell me about Carlos.

1:00:58.306 --> 1:01:01.527
But you have to hurry it up,
I got to get to the barn soon.

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:05.879
Well, it was both terrifying
and fun all at the same time.

1:01:05.923 --> 1:01:09.274
-But I'll tell you everything
once everyone's here tonight.
-Okay.

1:01:11.537 --> 1:01:13.626
Hey. Get a load of this.

1:01:13.670 --> 1:01:15.584
"Chief Graham still
investigating the death

1:01:15.628 --> 1:01:18.413
of prominent local lawyer
Harley Trudeau.

1:01:18.457 --> 1:01:20.633
Mr. Trudeau's body
was found in a cove

1:01:20.677 --> 1:01:23.854
along The Queen's Crown Golf
Course early Sunday morning.

1:01:23.897 --> 1:01:26.857
Mr. Trudeau is believed
to have passed sometime between

1:01:26.900 --> 1:01:29.555
11 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. Saturday.

1:01:29.598 --> 1:01:33.080
Few details have been released
regarding the suspicious death,

1:01:33.124 --> 1:01:35.343
but Mr. Trudeau appears
to have been the victim

1:01:35.387 --> 1:01:37.737
of a hit and run
by a small vehicle.

1:01:37.781 --> 1:01:41.349
Sources also report
a resident of the exclusive
neighborhood came forward

1:01:41.393 --> 1:01:43.177
saying he was out late
walking the court

1:01:43.221 --> 1:01:45.702
sometime around midnight
on the night in question

1:01:45.745 --> 1:01:49.793
when he saw a unicorn
chasing a white fox."

1:01:49.836 --> 1:01:51.751
-Brynn and Muffin.
-Brynn and Muffin.

1:01:51.795 --> 1:01:53.274
"This is a curious case indeed.

1:01:53.318 --> 1:01:55.233
The investigation is ongoing."

1:01:55.276 --> 1:01:58.149
Well... no news is good news.

1:01:58.192 --> 1:02:00.629
They haven't said
anything about you... yet.

1:02:00.673 --> 1:02:02.762
[sighs]

1:02:02.806 --> 1:02:05.852
[engine rumbling]

1:02:08.681 --> 1:02:11.292
-Hey there.
-Hey. This cart's kinda flat.

1:02:11.336 --> 1:02:13.425
I keep filling it up
but it just gets slow again.

1:02:13.468 --> 1:02:14.905
Maybe you should
go get cart two.

1:02:14.948 --> 1:02:16.776
It's fine.
I'll fill it when I come back.

1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:19.387
No, um, you should
probably go get cart two.

1:02:19.431 --> 1:02:20.519
[groans]

1:02:20.562 --> 1:02:21.912
[Dalton]
Are you alright?

1:02:21.955 --> 1:02:22.869
[Gina]
I'm not sure.

1:02:22.913 --> 1:02:24.653
It's just really hot.

1:02:24.697 --> 1:02:26.394
Are you gonna be okay to work?

1:02:27.569 --> 1:02:29.833
So kind of you to worry.

1:02:29.876 --> 1:02:31.748
Well, now I'm afraid
to let you go.

1:02:31.791 --> 1:02:33.575
Then don't.

1:02:33.619 --> 1:02:35.926
Admit it, you want me.

1:02:37.971 --> 1:02:41.148
Dalton, make no mistake.

1:02:41.192 --> 1:02:45.631
I'm a woman
and I'm nothing like that little
teenybopper girlfriend of yours.

1:02:46.501 --> 1:02:48.373
So the question is...

1:02:48.416 --> 1:02:50.810
...is the man in you
ready for me?

1:02:50.854 --> 1:02:52.943
I think I'd like to find out.

1:02:52.986 --> 1:02:56.598
And the little princess,
you'd dump her for me, right?

1:02:56.642 --> 1:02:57.556
Maybe.

1:03:00.646 --> 1:03:04.432
[Gina]
So, why did you do this job
when I hear you're rich?

1:03:05.303 --> 1:03:07.087
My parents have money, not me.

1:03:07.131 --> 1:03:09.220
And I'd say we're well-off.

1:03:09.263 --> 1:03:11.048
Plus, rich is relative.

1:03:12.353 --> 1:03:14.834
Well, relative to me,
you're rich.

1:03:14.878 --> 1:03:16.618
Well, I'm not a trust fund kid.

1:03:16.662 --> 1:03:18.403
I have to make my own way
like my dad did.

1:03:18.446 --> 1:03:21.319
Oh. How boring.

1:03:21.362 --> 1:03:23.930
And here I was
briefly interested in you.

1:03:25.062 --> 1:03:26.063
[Dalton scoffs]

1:03:27.804 --> 1:03:29.457
[engine rumbling]

1:03:30.328 --> 1:03:31.808
Hey, buddy.

1:03:31.851 --> 1:03:33.853
Oh. Uh, hey, what's the word?

1:03:34.941 --> 1:03:38.031
The word... spider.

1:03:38.075 --> 1:03:39.685
Just don't get caught up
in her web.

1:03:44.081 --> 1:03:46.910
[soft music playing]

1:03:46.953 --> 1:03:50.522
Hey, Foster. Nice to see you.

1:03:50.565 --> 1:03:53.264
Hey, long time, man.

1:03:53.307 --> 1:03:54.874
What you been up to?

1:03:54.918 --> 1:03:56.702
I hope you ain't been
working all the time.

1:03:56.745 --> 1:03:59.923
I've been squeezing in
time for fun, you know me.

1:03:59.966 --> 1:04:02.055
Yeah. [chuckling] Yeah, I do.

1:04:02.099 --> 1:04:04.362
Ever since you dated
my sister in high school.

1:04:04.405 --> 1:04:06.930
[chuckles softly] Yeah.
Ouch. Don't remind me.

1:04:08.279 --> 1:04:10.803
You know, high school is
further back for me than you.

1:04:10.847 --> 1:04:15.112
Well, uh, speaking matters
of the heart and, uh...

1:04:15.155 --> 1:04:16.504
...other body parts...

1:04:18.202 --> 1:04:21.031
...heard you and Ms. Trudeau
are an item.

1:04:21.074 --> 1:04:23.468
Uh, where'd you hear that?

1:04:25.339 --> 1:04:27.211
The winds of gossip.

1:04:27.254 --> 1:04:28.473
Isn't that true?

1:04:28.516 --> 1:04:31.911
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

1:04:31.955 --> 1:04:34.827
Been going on for, uh,
a few months now.

1:04:34.871 --> 1:04:37.874
I mean, it's nothing
serious, but, uh,

1:04:37.917 --> 1:04:39.571
don't tell anyone. Alright?

1:04:39.614 --> 1:04:41.921
[chuckles] Dude.

1:04:41.965 --> 1:04:43.314
What's up with that?

1:04:43.357 --> 1:04:45.577
She's got, like, what,
25 years on you.

1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:46.970
What can I say?

1:04:47.013 --> 1:04:49.624
I mean,
she was offering and really,

1:04:49.668 --> 1:04:51.713
you know, she's a blast.

1:04:51.757 --> 1:04:52.845
Okay.

1:04:55.239 --> 1:04:59.025
And what about her, uh,
husband's suspicious death?

1:04:59.069 --> 1:05:00.418
That don't worry you now?

1:05:01.375 --> 1:05:04.030
Nah, she's a genuine sweetie.

1:05:04.074 --> 1:05:06.119
I've known some sly women.

1:05:06.163 --> 1:05:07.468
She's not one of them.

1:05:09.253 --> 1:05:11.995
It's weird though... her husband
winding up in the lake

1:05:12.038 --> 1:05:13.735
while she's waiting
for me in my place.

1:05:15.259 --> 1:05:16.651
You sure about that?

1:05:16.695 --> 1:05:18.740
Yeah, man. I mean...

1:05:18.784 --> 1:05:20.873
...Winona and Harley
left the club cocktail party,

1:05:20.917 --> 1:05:22.440
uh, about ten or so.

1:05:22.483 --> 1:05:24.790
You know,
same time I sent Gina home.

1:05:24.833 --> 1:05:27.924
By 10:25, she was sending me
pics from my condo.

1:05:29.447 --> 1:05:30.752
Check these out.

1:05:34.017 --> 1:05:35.322
You see the time stamp?

1:05:36.976 --> 1:05:39.196
You know, they estimate Harley's
time of death after 11. So...

1:05:40.240 --> 1:05:43.287
Besides, Chief Bud
found Harley's golf cart
back at the club.

1:05:43.330 --> 1:05:45.332
Not a scratch on it.

1:05:45.376 --> 1:05:46.420
True.

1:05:48.466 --> 1:05:50.076
So you just went
right home after work?

1:05:51.512 --> 1:05:52.731
Yeah, briefly.

1:05:54.646 --> 1:05:58.041
[chuckles nervously] You're
asking all this officially
or unofficially?

1:05:58.084 --> 1:06:00.565
Unofficially. Of course.

1:06:00.608 --> 1:06:01.914
Of course.

1:06:03.785 --> 1:06:06.963
Well, I'll tell you the same
thing I told Chief Bud. Yeah.

1:06:07.006 --> 1:06:10.444
Got home 11:20,
changed, then, uh...

1:06:10.488 --> 1:06:12.533
...Winona and I went out
to the Chill Martini.

1:06:12.577 --> 1:06:14.971
Got there about 20 to midnight.

1:06:15.014 --> 1:06:16.755
When did you leave?

1:06:16.798 --> 1:06:18.278
Stayed till closing at two.

1:06:20.193 --> 1:06:23.022
You know, you ask a lot of these
unofficial questions, man.

1:06:23.066 --> 1:06:25.372
[chuckles] No worries, man.

1:06:25.416 --> 1:06:27.940
I-- just out of curiosity.

1:06:27.984 --> 1:06:31.422
-Yeah.
-Chief Bud's working
the case, not me.

1:06:31.465 --> 1:06:34.512
Ah. Yeah. Alright.
I doubt that, Tanner.

1:06:34.555 --> 1:06:36.993
I mean, you're trying to
beat Chief Bud to the punch
on this?

1:06:38.559 --> 1:06:41.954
I admit I'd like him to trust me
a little more, but, uh...

1:06:42.999 --> 1:06:44.217
No, that's not it.

1:06:46.045 --> 1:06:47.742
This is so unusual.

1:06:47.786 --> 1:06:50.223
Harley dying out there
on the golf course like that.

1:06:50.267 --> 1:06:53.531
Yeah. Well,
I'm not surprised. I mean...

1:06:53.574 --> 1:06:57.187
Don't let these luxury homes
and manicured lawns fool you.

1:06:57.230 --> 1:06:58.666
I see and hear plenty.

1:07:04.150 --> 1:07:05.630
Sure you do, my friend.

1:07:06.674 --> 1:07:07.936
Sure you do.

1:07:14.421 --> 1:07:16.945
Why do I keep letting you
talk me into this stuff?

1:07:16.989 --> 1:07:20.253
Because I didn't want to go
alone, and you're my friend.

1:07:20.297 --> 1:07:22.995
You torture me, Charlotte.
I felt a lot braver last night

1:07:23.039 --> 1:07:24.127
when we were playing
Call of Duty,

1:07:24.170 --> 1:07:26.042
but I'm just tired.

1:07:27.043 --> 1:07:29.045
Here. Have my latte.

1:07:32.439 --> 1:07:34.746
This is my payment
for being your bodyguard?

1:07:34.789 --> 1:07:37.575
-Half a latte?
-Do you want my cookie?

1:07:39.533 --> 1:07:40.491
Yes.

1:07:41.492 --> 1:07:43.189
So, what are we supposed to do?

1:07:43.233 --> 1:07:45.844
Just talk and act like
we don't notice them.

1:07:47.367 --> 1:07:50.153
-But what do we talk about?
-Same thing we always do.

1:07:50.196 --> 1:07:52.546
You know, like video games,
skateboarding,

1:07:52.590 --> 1:07:54.418
anime stuff-- Here they come.

1:07:55.593 --> 1:07:57.595
You sure you'll be ready?
I mean...

1:07:57.638 --> 1:07:59.945
-Maybe we just need to postpone.
-I'm fine, Jill.

1:07:59.988 --> 1:08:01.425
We're not postponing.

1:08:05.429 --> 1:08:08.171
My dad and I...
weren't close anymore.

1:08:09.172 --> 1:08:11.391
Okay, if you say so.

1:08:14.046 --> 1:08:17.484
Oh, shoot. I think they messed
up my drink order again.

1:08:17.528 --> 1:08:21.444
You did order me
a skinny soy ginger latte
with organic whip, right?

1:08:21.487 --> 1:08:23.228
-Of course.
-Mm.

1:08:23.273 --> 1:08:26.841
It tastes funny for some reason.
Oh, my gosh.

1:08:26.885 --> 1:08:29.496
I just remembered, I had
the best idea for our wedding.

1:08:29.540 --> 1:08:32.237
-Okay...
-Let's decorate your go-kart

1:08:32.282 --> 1:08:34.762
to be the escape vehicle
for our reception!

1:08:36.242 --> 1:08:38.288
Sorry, hun, I got rid of it.

1:08:38.331 --> 1:08:41.769
-What? Why? We had
so much fun on that car.
-I'm sorry, babe.

1:08:41.813 --> 1:08:43.206
I had to sell it.

1:08:43.249 --> 1:08:44.816
[Jill]
I don't understand, why?

1:08:44.859 --> 1:08:47.166
Just trust me, Jill.
I had to get rid of it.

1:08:47.210 --> 1:08:51.344
Okay. Jeez, it's like one of
those little trust exercises.

1:08:51.388 --> 1:08:55.086
But after our marriage,
no more secrets, okay, babe?

1:08:55.130 --> 1:08:58.656
-Just kiss me, beautiful.
-Ah. Sorry, babe, can't yet.

1:08:58.699 --> 1:09:02.442
-I'm serious about us taking
a break until after our big day.
-[groans]

1:09:02.486 --> 1:09:05.184
Jill, we lived together
for two years now. Come on.

1:09:05.228 --> 1:09:08.969
I know, but if we take
a little break it will be
just that much more special.

1:09:09.014 --> 1:09:11.886
-You know, our first time
as husband and wife.
-[grunting]

1:09:11.930 --> 1:09:14.280
Come on now, babe. No pouting.

1:09:15.237 --> 1:09:17.718
Hey. Good news.

1:09:17.762 --> 1:09:21.200
I've got enough money to pay for
both trips to Paris and Venice.

1:09:21.244 --> 1:09:25.422
-Mm. [chuckles]
-And in every country we'll be
doing it along the way.

1:09:25.465 --> 1:09:27.859
Please, Larson.
Okay, your cart was awesome,

1:09:27.902 --> 1:09:31.122
-but it's not enough
to fund our honeymoon, babe.
-No, of course not.

1:09:32.733 --> 1:09:34.692
Don't worry.
I've taken care of it.

1:09:34.735 --> 1:09:36.433
We're gonna have
plenty of money soon.

1:09:37.956 --> 1:09:42.916
I have-- It's another
trust exercise. Okay?

1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:43.917
Okay.

1:09:45.268 --> 1:09:47.747
-Happy?
-[chuckles] Super!

1:09:47.791 --> 1:09:49.663
Let's take a walk down
to the bridal shop,

1:09:49.707 --> 1:09:52.578
and you show me what outrageous
dresses you picked out

1:09:52.622 --> 1:09:54.712
-to torture
those bridesmaids with.
-Yes! [chuckles]

1:09:54.755 --> 1:09:56.844
Oh, now.
What are we going to wear

1:09:56.888 --> 1:09:59.325
to the club's
cocktail party tomorrow night?

1:09:59.369 --> 1:10:02.154
Oh, wait, I know. I'll wear
floral, you wear gingham.

1:10:02.198 --> 1:10:04.809
-We'll look as fresh
as a summer picnic!
-Come on, Jill!

1:10:24.655 --> 1:10:25.786
[gasps]

1:10:25.830 --> 1:10:27.309
Bill!

1:10:27.353 --> 1:10:29.746
This looks ridiculous!

1:10:30.748 --> 1:10:35.448
Now you know you can afford
to have the name properly
painted on there.

1:10:35.492 --> 1:10:38.016
I will. I will.

1:10:40.844 --> 1:10:42.585
Your knee still aching?

1:10:43.848 --> 1:10:48.068
Bill, I have told you a hundred
times ago, get that looked at.

1:10:48.112 --> 1:10:50.071
Now, why haven't you gone yet?

1:10:50.115 --> 1:10:53.249
Marilyn. I've been busy.

1:10:53.291 --> 1:10:57.688
I forget it hurts
until it hurts. You know me.

1:10:57.731 --> 1:11:00.255
Yes, I do know you.

1:11:00.299 --> 1:11:02.648
So if you need me to call
and make an appointment for you,

1:11:02.693 --> 1:11:05.391
I will.
You just got to tell me when.

1:11:05.434 --> 1:11:10.178
Marilyn, thanks,
but I don't need you
to make no appointment for me.

1:11:10.222 --> 1:11:12.702
I do it when I do it.

1:11:12.746 --> 1:11:15.793
You just fussing
because you want me
to finish your to-do list.

1:11:15.835 --> 1:11:18.404
-My to-do list?
-Yes.

1:11:18.448 --> 1:11:20.058
Our to-do list.

1:11:21.277 --> 1:11:23.931
Now, we may be divorced, Bill,
but you promised me

1:11:23.975 --> 1:11:26.064
you'd help me take care
of our family home.

1:11:26.107 --> 1:11:28.066
So I'm gonna hold you to that.

1:11:28.109 --> 1:11:31.243
And besides, Jill's wedding
will be here before you know it.

1:11:31.287 --> 1:11:35.334
And I know you don't want
to let your baby girl down.
I know that.

1:11:35.378 --> 1:11:37.205
So, get that knee looked at,

1:11:37.249 --> 1:11:39.338
because you don't do
anybody any good

1:11:39.382 --> 1:11:41.427
sitting around
on your bum all day.

1:11:41.471 --> 1:11:42.559
Yes, ma'am.

1:11:45.388 --> 1:11:47.955
-Hi, Ms. Connor.
-Hi, Scarlet.

1:11:47.999 --> 1:11:49.261
Have a good day.

1:11:50.130 --> 1:11:51.263
Hello, Colonel.

1:11:51.307 --> 1:11:53.874
Hey, Miss Lady, what you up to?

1:11:53.918 --> 1:11:56.398
Looking for someone to share
my coconut cupcakes with.

1:11:56.442 --> 1:11:58.966
I made them for Daddy, but
he had to fly off to New York.

1:11:59.010 --> 1:12:01.404
If that's an offer,
I'd love one.

1:12:01.447 --> 1:12:03.231
Think your mom would want one?

1:12:03.275 --> 1:12:05.146
Oh, you know her,
she's on a diet.

1:12:06.147 --> 1:12:08.280
I should be on
one myself, but...

1:12:09.412 --> 1:12:12.371
...you only live once and I
don't want to have any regrets.

1:12:14.330 --> 1:12:16.288
Mm.

1:12:16.332 --> 1:12:19.422
-Miss, you are
one of the best bakers I know.
-Thank you.

1:12:19.465 --> 1:12:21.206
It's like it's your super power.

1:12:23.164 --> 1:12:26.603
So, Colonel, I noticed
your golf cart isn't
in its usual parking space.

1:12:27.517 --> 1:12:31.259
Well, uh, I had--
I had an incident and, uh...

1:12:31.303 --> 1:12:33.349
-...sent her off for repairs.
-Oh, my!

1:12:33.392 --> 1:12:35.655
Um, what happened?

1:12:35.699 --> 1:12:38.309
Uh, well, it was late

1:12:38.353 --> 1:12:41.094
and dark and I was coming
back from the club,

1:12:41.139 --> 1:12:43.663
and, you know, I--
I hit something.

1:12:43.707 --> 1:12:46.449
Oh, my. I sure hope
it wasn't a person.

1:12:46.492 --> 1:12:49.407
Oh, God. No, it was,
gracious, no, it was--

1:12:49.452 --> 1:12:51.671
It was like, uh, it was like a,

1:12:51.715 --> 1:12:54.370
you know, it was like a post,
you know, in the parking lot.

1:12:55.371 --> 1:12:57.111
-You know?
-Oh.

1:12:57.155 --> 1:13:00.724
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah. And anyhow,
take this out, I got to--

1:13:00.767 --> 1:13:03.422
I gotta go get dressed
for dinner and, uh...

1:13:03.466 --> 1:13:05.903
-[unintelligible]
-No, no, no.
I understand that, but hey.

1:13:05.946 --> 1:13:08.166
Yeah, it's time for you to go,
young lady, and, uh...

1:13:08.209 --> 1:13:11.343
Yeah. Yeah. And I-- I'll be
seeing you and your parents

1:13:11.387 --> 1:13:14.520
tomorrow night at the club.
Hey, you have-- Yeah.

1:13:14.564 --> 1:13:16.522
-Yeah. You have a good night.
-Okay. Bye. Thank you.

1:13:16.566 --> 1:13:19.786
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

1:13:24.922 --> 1:13:27.577
[calm music]

1:13:27.620 --> 1:13:28.621
[Vonne]
Okay.

1:13:30.580 --> 1:13:33.887
Oh, hey, Char. You've finally
come to learn from the master.

1:13:33.931 --> 1:13:36.499
Uh, you're
my sailing instructor?

1:13:36.541 --> 1:13:38.239
I know, right? Lucky.

1:13:38.282 --> 1:13:41.373
Um, alright. So I am
going to take us for a sail.

1:13:41.416 --> 1:13:43.593
Uh, I'll just teach you parts
of the boat, sailing terms

1:13:43.636 --> 1:13:45.638
while we're out on the water.
Is that cool?

1:13:45.682 --> 1:13:47.814
-Okay.
-Alright.

1:13:47.858 --> 1:13:49.425
First things first.
Life jacket on.

1:13:49.468 --> 1:13:52.297
Safety rule numero uno.Got it?

1:13:52.340 --> 1:13:54.212
[chuckles]

1:13:54.255 --> 1:13:55.822
Alright.

1:13:55.866 --> 1:13:58.608
There is not much wind
in here right now.

1:13:58.651 --> 1:14:01.219
So, I hope you like the paddle.

1:14:01.262 --> 1:14:02.481
You need-- you need help?

1:14:03.743 --> 1:14:05.832
-You got it?
-Yeah, I got it.

1:14:05.876 --> 1:14:07.225
They just crossed--

1:14:08.618 --> 1:14:10.532
No, like this one--
This one goes here.

1:14:11.925 --> 1:14:14.580
One there. Two...

1:14:14.624 --> 1:14:17.452
Sweet. Alright. How much
strength you got in these arms?

1:14:17.496 --> 1:14:20.673
-Uh...
-It'll do. Alright.
You want to help me pushing it?

1:14:20.717 --> 1:14:22.370
Alright, let's go.

1:14:22.414 --> 1:14:23.937
[grunts] Okay then,
we're straight.

1:14:25.809 --> 1:14:27.853
Alright. So, the front
is called the bow,
back is called the stern.

1:14:27.898 --> 1:14:30.943
Left side is port,
right side is starboard. Got it?

1:14:30.987 --> 1:14:32.642
-I guess.
-Don't worry.

1:14:32.684 --> 1:14:34.469
The more you sail,
easier it's going to get.

1:14:34.513 --> 1:14:37.559
-Hey, you know why
this is called the boom?
-No.

1:14:37.603 --> 1:14:40.998
-Why?
-So, when we cross wind,
if you don't duck,

1:14:41.041 --> 1:14:43.566
that's the sound is gonna make
when it hits you in the face.

1:14:47.526 --> 1:14:48.701
[boom]

1:14:54.141 --> 1:14:57.754
[romantic music]

1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:41.798
[Aubrey]
Hey, Scarlet, I want you
to invite another person

1:15:41.841 --> 1:15:43.234
to Charlotte's dinner party
tomorrow night.

1:15:43.277 --> 1:15:45.584
-Okay. Who?
-Grant.

1:15:45.628 --> 1:15:47.891
-Why?
-Well...

1:15:47.934 --> 1:15:49.501
I think it'd be
really nice if she sees him.

1:15:49.545 --> 1:15:51.547
[phone ringing]

1:15:52.678 --> 1:15:54.245
Hey, Dalton, where are you?

1:15:55.289 --> 1:15:58.858
[Dalton]
Um, I'm helping my dad
rebuild the deck.

1:15:58.902 --> 1:16:01.034
He's probably not
going to let me go right now.

1:16:01.077 --> 1:16:02.645
Oh, that sucks.

1:16:03.559 --> 1:16:06.083
[Dalton]
And I've just been
working a lot.

1:16:06.126 --> 1:16:07.911
-We've got to get this done.
-Oh, yeah.

1:16:07.954 --> 1:16:10.566
Okay, I understand.

1:16:10.609 --> 1:16:13.612
Scarlet and I were just
talking about Char's
dinner party tomorrow night.

1:16:13.656 --> 1:16:15.222
You are coming, right?

1:16:15.266 --> 1:16:17.398
[Dalton]
I'll be there. I promise.

1:16:17.442 --> 1:16:18.748
Okay. Bye.

1:16:20.793 --> 1:16:23.535
Okay. So, Roxi
can't come tonight.

1:16:23.579 --> 1:16:25.624
But we have Finn here with us.

1:16:25.668 --> 1:16:28.627
-New cut and all.
-Please, hold your applause.

1:16:28.671 --> 1:16:30.020
Dalton can't make it tonight.

1:16:30.063 --> 1:16:31.674
We already know
who killed Harley.

1:16:31.717 --> 1:16:33.284
It was totally Carlos.

1:16:33.327 --> 1:16:34.938
Char even said that the cart
was all banged up

1:16:34.981 --> 1:16:36.504
and had blood all over it.

1:16:36.548 --> 1:16:38.332
Case closed.

1:16:38.376 --> 1:16:40.508
Maybe. But speaking of blood,

1:16:40.552 --> 1:16:43.424
Roxi's cousin
was able to test
the blood from the sand trap.

1:16:43.468 --> 1:16:45.383
Turns out it was
a match to Harley.

1:16:45.425 --> 1:16:48.473
-So we do know where he died.
-Then we're done.

1:16:48.516 --> 1:16:51.084
We know who and we know where.
We got to call Chief Bud.

1:16:51.128 --> 1:16:54.522
I don't know just yet.
Carlos seems like
a pretty smart guy.

1:16:54.566 --> 1:16:57.656
If he were to kill Harley,
he wouldn't leave the cart
next to his camper.

1:16:57.700 --> 1:16:59.745
He would have dumped it.

1:16:59.789 --> 1:17:03.401
Yeah, but you know who did
get rid of his cart really fast?

1:17:03.443 --> 1:17:06.273
-Larsen.
-That's right. We overheard him
say that he sold it.

1:17:06.317 --> 1:17:09.799
He told his fiancée,
Jill that he's going to have
some big money coming in.

1:17:09.842 --> 1:17:13.411
I knew it.
Larson killed his father
so he could take his money.

1:17:13.454 --> 1:17:17.241
That earring
could belong to Jill,
if they were working together.

1:17:17.284 --> 1:17:20.070
I think we need
to do a little bit more
investigating on Larson

1:17:20.112 --> 1:17:21.853
before we go call Chief Bud.

1:17:21.898 --> 1:17:23.594
I don't think
Jill's involved though.

1:17:23.639 --> 1:17:25.858
She plays a pretty
clueless bride-to-be.

1:17:26.859 --> 1:17:29.209
Maybe the earring
isn't related at all.

1:17:29.253 --> 1:17:32.952
The cart manager did tell Dalton
that one of the beer carts
was off for repairs.

1:17:32.996 --> 1:17:35.346
He said it was weird because
they usually do it in-house.

1:17:35.389 --> 1:17:37.565
What about Foster and Winona?

1:17:37.609 --> 1:17:39.698
Are we sure
that they are both clear?

1:17:39.742 --> 1:17:43.702
Based on what Tanner said,
Foster and Winona
sound pretty innocent.

1:17:43.746 --> 1:17:45.922
You know, Roxi knows the
managers at the Chill Martini's.

1:17:45.965 --> 1:17:47.924
Some of her art
is displayed there.

1:17:47.967 --> 1:17:51.014
We can have her go and
find out what time they left.

1:17:51.057 --> 1:17:54.887
What about the Colonel?
He sounded pretty guilty.

1:17:54.931 --> 1:17:58.848
Aubrey, you should tell Dalton
to track down the Colonel's cart
at the local repair shops.

1:17:58.891 --> 1:18:01.241
-See if he can find out
what happened to it.
-Okay.

1:18:01.285 --> 1:18:02.982
And it has to be
done by tomorrow

1:18:03.026 --> 1:18:06.029
because our three days
ends tomorrow night.

1:18:06.072 --> 1:18:08.901
If any of you
find anything, text me.

1:18:08.945 --> 1:18:11.034
Maybe we'll see some
of the suspects at the club.

1:18:11.077 --> 1:18:14.472
Yeah, it's true.
We could probably spy on them
at Char's dinner.

1:18:14.514 --> 1:18:16.255
[sighs] I don't know
why my mother insists

1:18:16.300 --> 1:18:18.563
on giving me a birthday party
at the Country Club.

1:18:18.606 --> 1:18:20.347
Not exactly my scene.

1:18:20.391 --> 1:18:22.045
Because the food is awesome,

1:18:22.088 --> 1:18:23.742
and you know she likes
a reason to get dressed up.

1:18:23.786 --> 1:18:26.484
Alright,
I want to play some COD.

1:18:26.527 --> 1:18:27.615
-[Finn] Yes.
-[Aubrey] Yes.

1:18:27.659 --> 1:18:28.704
I'll go get snacks.

1:18:32.969 --> 1:18:35.666
[Aubrey]
I'm so happy we finally
get to spend some time together.

1:18:35.710 --> 1:18:36.755
Mm-hmm.

1:18:38.714 --> 1:18:43.240
Dalton. Do you think this is
going to turn out okay?

1:18:43.282 --> 1:18:46.373
I hope so. It's your little
joyride is gonna cost us all.

1:18:46.416 --> 1:18:48.985
Hey! I wasn't out there alone.

1:18:49.028 --> 1:18:50.769
-I thought we were
in this together.
-Yeah.

1:18:50.813 --> 1:18:53.032
Rapping to the point
where we both go to prison.

1:18:53.076 --> 1:18:55.731
-[Vonne] Hey, love birds.
-What are you doing here?

1:18:55.773 --> 1:18:58.124
It's called chasing
you down for your half
of the Jet Ski money.

1:18:58.168 --> 1:19:00.474
We've only got, like, two
hours till I lose my deposit.

1:19:00.518 --> 1:19:02.346
Yeah. Um...

1:19:02.389 --> 1:19:05.175
So, this is where you're
always running off to.

1:19:05.218 --> 1:19:07.830
[chuckles softly]
Yeah. Come meet
my secret love, Chanel.

1:19:11.224 --> 1:19:13.835
Be scared?
It's just a horse, man.

1:19:13.879 --> 1:19:15.184
Just a horse?

1:19:15.228 --> 1:19:17.361
She's my baby and we're a team.

1:19:17.404 --> 1:19:20.843
I trust her that she will
take care of me over the jumps.

1:19:20.886 --> 1:19:22.670
She's pretty cool.

1:19:22.714 --> 1:19:25.456
But I admit, I've never, um...

1:19:25.499 --> 1:19:28.154
I've never been
around a horse before.

1:19:28.198 --> 1:19:30.809
Oh. So you do have
holes in your armor.

1:19:30.853 --> 1:19:32.768
Don't be afraid.
She's the sweetest.

1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:40.645
It's okay. Here.
Just right there. Yeah.

1:19:40.688 --> 1:19:41.994
Oh, she's actually soft.

1:19:42.038 --> 1:19:44.954
Yeah. Here.
You can give her a treat.

1:19:47.260 --> 1:19:48.784
Here.

1:19:48.827 --> 1:19:51.395
So, just right there.

1:19:52.962 --> 1:19:54.920
-There you go.
-I just like that one.

1:19:54.964 --> 1:19:57.096
Okay. I think that's
enough fun on the farm time.

1:19:57.139 --> 1:19:59.882
-Let's go.
-That's right.
We got business to do.

1:19:59.925 --> 1:20:02.188
You keep dodging me,
I'm gonna be out $1,000.

1:20:02.232 --> 1:20:04.538
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

1:20:04.582 --> 1:20:07.150
-See you tonight, babe.
-Oh!

1:20:07.193 --> 1:20:08.193
Okay.

1:20:11.807 --> 1:20:14.722
-[Vonne] Almost forgot these.
-Oh, thank you.

1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:17.856
Thanks for showing me
your secret love.

1:20:17.900 --> 1:20:19.075
She's beautiful.

1:20:25.951 --> 1:20:29.825
[calm music]

1:20:36.962 --> 1:20:40.139
Well. Hello, Aubrey.
Can I help you?

1:20:40.183 --> 1:20:41.619
Hello, Mrs. Graham.

1:20:41.662 --> 1:20:43.055
I've got groceries
for the food pantry.

1:20:43.099 --> 1:20:44.883
Oh, great!

1:20:44.927 --> 1:20:47.668
We can set them on back there
by the other boxes.

1:20:52.369 --> 1:20:55.067
I'll make sure it gets
with the rest of the donations.

1:21:00.550 --> 1:21:03.815
We were going to bring
them on Sunday, but then...

1:21:03.859 --> 1:21:05.948
Well, that's okay.

1:21:05.991 --> 1:21:07.862
It's not too late.

1:21:07.906 --> 1:21:10.387
The food bank
hasn't even picked up yet.

1:21:10.430 --> 1:21:12.389
I've got more
in the front of my truck.

1:21:12.432 --> 1:21:14.130
Great. I'll help you.

1:21:16.262 --> 1:21:18.656
So, how are you, dear?

1:21:18.699 --> 1:21:21.005
I hear you had some trouble
with your golf cart.

1:21:21.050 --> 1:21:22.660
Oh. Yeah.

1:21:28.273 --> 1:21:30.102
You know...

1:21:30.146 --> 1:21:33.932
...when I have things
on my heart weighing me down,

1:21:33.976 --> 1:21:36.239
I bring my words to God.

1:21:36.282 --> 1:21:39.503
There's nothing your
Heavenly Father can't handle.

1:21:39.546 --> 1:21:40.896
Just talk to Him.

1:21:42.985 --> 1:21:48.338
How about if you take
a quiet moment and go inside

1:21:48.380 --> 1:21:50.121
and sit down in the sanctuary?

1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:53.255
If you can't find the words...

1:21:53.299 --> 1:21:55.344
Well, that's okay.

1:21:55.388 --> 1:21:57.564
You don't need to speak.

1:21:57.608 --> 1:21:59.044
He hears your heart.

1:22:02.004 --> 1:22:03.135
Okay.

1:22:04.267 --> 1:22:05.137
Thank you.

1:22:13.145 --> 1:22:14.364
[phone beeping]

1:22:35.994 --> 1:22:37.300
Hey, did you see the text?

1:22:39.128 --> 1:22:40.999
We're close now. Yay!

1:22:41.043 --> 1:22:43.784
Hey, are Dalton and you okay?

1:22:43.827 --> 1:22:46.222
Actually, I'm not sure.

1:22:46.264 --> 1:22:49.268
Sometimes he's great and
the next thing I know he's gone.

1:22:49.312 --> 1:22:51.575
Yeah, I can see
why you feel that way.

1:22:51.618 --> 1:22:54.230
I tried to be patient
and he's always focused
on trying to pay

1:22:54.273 --> 1:22:56.580
for half of his college tuition
like his dad wants.

1:22:56.623 --> 1:23:00.148
But honestly, I think he's
over me and hasn't told me yet.

1:23:00.192 --> 1:23:02.151
But are you
really that into him?

1:23:02.193 --> 1:23:03.848
I'm starting to wonder.

1:23:03.891 --> 1:23:06.023
But I am looking forward
to seeing him tonight.

1:23:06.068 --> 1:23:08.157
Are you looking forward
to see anyone tonight?

1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:10.986
-No.
-Maybe you should
open your eyes more.

1:23:11.029 --> 1:23:13.989
You got some sweet friends
that would make some
good boyfriend material.

1:23:14.032 --> 1:23:18.036
-No, Aubrey.
-Okay, if you say so.

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:19.777
Hey, will help me with my hair?

1:23:19.820 --> 1:23:20.778
Sure.

1:23:23.346 --> 1:23:26.958
[calm music]

1:23:27.002 --> 1:23:29.874
Ah, Mom texted.
She's running a bit late.

1:23:29.916 --> 1:23:31.267
Dad's flight
was diverted to Raleigh.

1:23:31.309 --> 1:23:32.964
She's going there
to pick him up.

1:23:33.008 --> 1:23:36.054
Okay. Uh,
shouldn't Dalton be here by now?

1:23:36.098 --> 1:23:38.143
Yeah, he's coming, he promised.

1:23:40.232 --> 1:23:43.627
[indistinct chatter]

1:23:43.670 --> 1:23:46.891
Oh. I guess
he's not coming after all.

1:23:46.934 --> 1:23:47.892
Excuse me.

1:23:48.849 --> 1:23:50.112
Aubrey, it will be okay.

1:23:51.764 --> 1:23:55.204
-Hey, Brynn, I like your onesie.
-[Betsy] Brynn, don't run off.

1:23:55.246 --> 1:23:56.814
Oh, excuse me!

1:23:56.857 --> 1:23:59.034
-Hey, Betsy.
-Hey, sweetie.

1:23:59.077 --> 1:24:02.514
I could not get her
to put on her dress,
so I just finally gave up.

1:24:02.559 --> 1:24:06.519
You know, with autism, you have
to pick your battles carefully,
because there's so many.

1:24:06.563 --> 1:24:09.434
Right. Well, I like it.
She looks party ready.

1:24:09.478 --> 1:24:12.090
I know I am. I need a drink.

1:24:12.134 --> 1:24:14.484
I'll be right back.
I need to find Brynn.

1:24:14.527 --> 1:24:17.835
[indistinct chatter]

1:24:17.878 --> 1:24:19.489
[whispering] Why is Grant here?

1:24:19.532 --> 1:24:20.968
Oh, Scarlet invited him.

1:24:22.187 --> 1:24:24.189
Roxi! I love your dress.

1:24:24.233 --> 1:24:27.279
Thanks. Hey, Finn,
Charlotte pulled you out again.

1:24:27.323 --> 1:24:30.108
Well, I've been
in high demand lately.

1:24:30.152 --> 1:24:32.371
Lucky Finn,
isn't he the popular one?

1:24:32.415 --> 1:24:34.895
Grant. You clean up nicely.

1:24:34.939 --> 1:24:37.811
Thanks. I'm, uh, trying to get
noticed by someone special.

1:24:40.118 --> 1:24:42.728
Come on, Grant,
let's go grab drinks
for everyone while we wait.

1:24:42.773 --> 1:24:44.383
Sure.

1:24:44.427 --> 1:24:46.646
[Charlotte chuckles]
Is, uh, is this a thing?

1:24:46.690 --> 1:24:49.300
No, this is not a thing.

1:24:49.344 --> 1:24:50.563
Are you jealous?

1:24:51.521 --> 1:24:53.653
Are you flirting with me?

1:24:54.959 --> 1:24:57.179
That's what it takes
to get your attention?

1:24:57.222 --> 1:24:58.397
Then yeah.

1:25:02.445 --> 1:25:05.012
Oh. This is interesting.

1:25:06.188 --> 1:25:09.147
Uh, come on, Roxi, let's--
let's go get those sodas.

1:25:09.191 --> 1:25:12.107
Oh, right. Yeah, I love
a good root beer.

1:25:14.761 --> 1:25:16.894
Actually, I can't stay.

1:25:16.937 --> 1:25:19.592
My uncle's visiting, so I have
to have dinner with my family.

1:25:19.636 --> 1:25:22.029
But I just want to say

1:25:22.073 --> 1:25:24.554

-Happy birthday, Charlotte.

Wow. Cal, I...

1:25:53.757 --> 1:25:55.802
I have no words. That--

1:25:55.846 --> 1:25:57.369
Did Scarlet put you up to this?

1:25:57.413 --> 1:26:00.023
Yes. Now can we go inside?
I'm starving.

1:26:01.764 --> 1:26:03.157

Sorry, Cal.

Hey, what can I get you?

1:26:16.475 --> 1:26:18.085
Uh, three cherry sodas,

1:26:18.129 --> 1:26:20.349
-and root beer, right?
-Yeah.

1:26:20.392 --> 1:26:21.871
I really do like root beer.

1:26:21.915 --> 1:26:22.960
Alright. You got it.

-Uh, hey.
-Hey. What are you doing here?

1:26:33.275 --> 1:26:34.928
I've got a date.

1:26:34.972 --> 1:26:36.800
Oh, another
country club princess

1:26:36.843 --> 1:26:38.062

1:26:38.105 --> 1:26:39.411
[chuckles] Of course.

1:26:39.455 --> 1:26:41.630
That's my favorite type.
Why are you here?

1:26:41.674 --> 1:26:43.981
Uh, we're celebrating
Char's birthday.

1:26:44.023 --> 1:26:46.201
Uh, where's Dalton?
Is he not your date?

1:26:46.244 --> 1:26:50.727
Um, he bailed on me again.

1:26:50.770 --> 1:26:52.684
I'm pretty sure we're over.

1:26:52.728 --> 1:26:54.905
You know, if that's true,
he should man up and tell you.

1:26:56.254 --> 1:26:57.995
Look, you're not
the only one getting dumped.

1:26:58.038 --> 1:27:00.215
He completely left me hanging
on the Jet Ski deal.

1:27:00.258 --> 1:27:02.652
Oh, I'm sorry.
You lost your deposit?

1:27:02.695 --> 1:27:04.044
Yeah. Well...

1:27:06.046 --> 1:27:09.441
[sighs] Aubrey, you look
really pretty tonight.

1:27:09.485 --> 1:27:12.270
Oh. Thanks.

1:27:12.314 --> 1:27:14.359
I'm sorry,
he made you come alone.

1:27:15.447 --> 1:27:16.840
Whatever his reasons,

1:27:16.883 --> 1:27:18.710
I hope it was
pretty damn important,

1:27:18.755 --> 1:27:20.931
because he is a fool.

1:27:21.844 --> 1:27:23.237
Excuse me.

1:27:27.416 --> 1:27:29.287
-One, two.
-There it is.

1:27:29.331 --> 1:27:32.072
-There you go, three.

check the back for root beer.
-Okay. Thank you.

-I'll see you out there.
-Okay.

1:27:37.339 --> 1:27:40.951

1:27:48.523 --> 1:27:50.003
Figured I'd find you here.

1:27:52.615 --> 1:27:54.660
Mom, I did what you asked.

1:27:54.704 --> 1:27:58.273
Really? You wouldn't
lie to me now, would you?

1:27:58.316 --> 1:28:00.100
Your daddy used
to lie to me and I--

1:28:00.144 --> 1:28:02.668
-I know you wouldn't lie to me.
-I'm not!

1:28:02.712 --> 1:28:04.931
[Winona]
You paid off
all your gambling debts,

1:28:04.975 --> 1:28:06.889
all of it, like we agreed?

1:28:06.933 --> 1:28:11.198
Yes. I sold my boat, Jet Skis
and the golf cart to do it.

1:28:11.242 --> 1:28:13.070
That's my good boy.

1:28:13.112 --> 1:28:15.638
[Larson]
Now, would you
pay for my honeymoon?

1:28:15.681 --> 1:28:17.204
[Winona]
Of course, baby.

1:28:17.248 --> 1:28:20.120
I'll always make sure
we're taken care of.

1:28:21.034 --> 1:28:22.384
Thanks, Mom.

1:28:25.169 --> 1:28:26.170
[mouthing] Good boy.

1:28:26.213 --> 1:28:28.041
And here's that root beer.

1:28:30.043 --> 1:28:31.523
Thank you. [chuckles]

1:28:46.059 --> 1:28:47.409
Hey, sugar.

1:28:47.452 --> 1:28:48.758
Ms. Trudeau.

1:28:49.628 --> 1:28:50.889
What can I do for you?

1:28:50.934 --> 1:28:53.415
I think you know.

1:28:53.458 --> 1:28:56.592
Alright, Winona, simmer down.

1:28:56.635 --> 1:28:59.116
I'm gonna go home
and pack an overnight bag,

1:28:59.159 --> 1:29:02.206
and then I'm gonna
head on over to your house,

1:29:02.249 --> 1:29:03.903
if that's alright with you.

1:29:04.948 --> 1:29:06.210
Oh, yes, ma'am.

1:29:29.494 --> 1:29:30.407
Found her!

1:29:31.844 --> 1:29:34.325
Oh. Oh, there's Gina.
I want to get a drink.

1:29:35.978 --> 1:29:37.371
Brynn!

1:29:37.415 --> 1:29:39.591
Oh, my goodness.
I am losing my mind.

1:29:39.635 --> 1:29:42.159
-Don't worry. I'll get her.
-The host has said
our tables are ready.

1:29:42.202 --> 1:29:43.160
[Cal]
Awesome.

1:29:49.949 --> 1:29:52.430
"Oh, thanks
for the drink, Finn."
"Oh, no problem, Charlotte."

1:29:57.478 --> 1:29:58.349
Brynn?

1:29:59.742 --> 1:30:00.699
Brynn?

1:30:03.267 --> 1:30:04.660
Where did you get that?

1:30:08.707 --> 1:30:09.621
[gasps]

1:30:13.930 --> 1:30:16.759
You. You're the unicorn witness?

1:30:16.802 --> 1:30:20.415
Aubrey, Carlos
isn't the killer, Gina is.

1:30:20.458 --> 1:30:22.852
Yes. And I have proof.
Gina killed Harley.

1:30:22.895 --> 1:30:24.505
I'm in the bathroom now, hurry.

1:30:27.596 --> 1:30:30.642
[suspenseful music]

1:30:35.299 --> 1:30:37.693
Gina is the killer. Her and
Harley were having an affair.

1:30:37.736 --> 1:30:39.825
-What? Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

1:30:39.869 --> 1:30:41.610
And I think
Brynn witnessed the murder.

1:30:41.653 --> 1:30:44.047
She was on the golf course
the night Harley died.

1:30:44.090 --> 1:30:45.962
Gina's after her,
and we have to find her.

1:30:46.005 --> 1:30:47.572
Come on,
let's try the parking lot.

1:30:49.052 --> 1:30:51.880
[suspenseful music continues]

1:31:01.368 --> 1:31:02.761
We got to tell Chief Bud!

1:31:21.084 --> 1:31:21.954

1:31:23.129 --> 1:31:24.740
Get off me, asshole!

1:31:24.782 --> 1:31:26.175
What's wrong with you?

1:31:26.219 --> 1:31:27.656
That's enough out of you.

1:31:27.699 --> 1:31:29.396
-Let's get her up.
-I didn't do anything.

1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:30.789
[Tanner grunts]

1:31:30.833 --> 1:31:32.225
Come on now, you get her cuffed,

1:31:32.269 --> 1:31:34.619
and we'll sort this out.
Take her in.

1:31:42.235 --> 1:31:44.455
Mom and Dad are on their way
back from the airport.

1:31:44.499 --> 1:31:46.022
Did you send your friends home?

1:31:46.065 --> 1:31:48.198
Yeah. Their parents
are picking them up now.

1:31:49.982 --> 1:31:51.418
[door creaks open]

1:31:58.034 --> 1:32:00.384
Brynn. Oh, I was so worried.

1:32:02.081 --> 1:32:03.300
Alright, Charlotte.

1:32:04.954 --> 1:32:09.393
We did find Miss Young pursuing
your cousin rather aggressively.

1:32:09.436 --> 1:32:11.874
I had Sergeant Hart
take her back to the station.

1:32:12.831 --> 1:32:17.749
Now. How about you telling me
what's got you so worried?

1:32:17.793 --> 1:32:20.360
I know that Gina
killed Harley Trudeau.

1:32:20.404 --> 1:32:21.623
And you know this how?

1:32:23.014 --> 1:32:25.017
I've got pics of Harley
and her together.

1:32:25.061 --> 1:32:26.584
I got them off of her phone.

1:32:26.628 --> 1:32:28.281
I'm pretty sure
they were having an affair.

1:32:29.718 --> 1:32:32.329
Okay. Anything else?

1:32:32.371 --> 1:32:34.112
See those expensive earrings?

1:32:34.157 --> 1:32:36.376
Pretty sure
Harley gave them to her.

1:32:36.420 --> 1:32:39.728
-Go on.
-She had them on
at the club cocktail party

1:32:39.771 --> 1:32:41.599
the night that he was killed.

1:32:41.643 --> 1:32:43.383
Brynn was outside
playing around the golf course,

1:32:43.427 --> 1:32:44.559
and she found the earring

1:32:44.602 --> 1:32:45.907
in a sand trap
near the crime scene.

1:32:51.522 --> 1:32:53.611
And that's where I also found...

1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:55.960
...its match.

1:32:59.878 --> 1:33:01.401
You're gonna want
this sandbag too.

1:33:03.228 --> 1:33:05.536
Harley's body
was hit by a small car,

1:33:05.580 --> 1:33:07.973
a cart in this case.
Look at this.

1:33:08.017 --> 1:33:11.237
I took pics of the tracks
around the sand trap,
just after the murder.

1:33:11.281 --> 1:33:14.632
Two cart tracks lead into
the trap, three tracks lead out.

1:33:14.675 --> 1:33:17.287
And you'll find
Harley's blood soaked
into the sand, if you dig.

1:33:20.638 --> 1:33:23.335
See the tracks here? And here?

1:33:23.380 --> 1:33:26.469
In this pic, Gina and Harley,
look at his tie.

1:33:30.039 --> 1:33:32.650
This is the tie Harley
was wearing the night he died.

1:33:32.693 --> 1:33:34.696
You can see it
in the party pics.

1:33:34.739 --> 1:33:38.351
I'm sure that Brynn saw Gina
run over Harley with the cart.

1:33:38.395 --> 1:33:40.005
That's why Brynn's been
running away from her.

1:33:40.049 --> 1:33:42.617
And that's why
Gina chased after her.

1:33:42.660 --> 1:33:44.923
Harley's body
was found in the cove.

1:33:44.967 --> 1:33:47.621
That's why there are three track
marks leading out of the trap,

1:33:47.665 --> 1:33:50.059
and why he had
strangle marks on his neck.

1:33:50.102 --> 1:33:52.670
Gina tied his necktie
to the cart hitch,

1:33:52.714 --> 1:33:55.499
-and dragged him to the pond.
-[gasps]

1:33:55.541 --> 1:33:59.590
Oh, good Lord!
It's no wonder his head
didn't pop off like a grape.

1:33:59.634 --> 1:34:03.159
We've heard enough, Brynn and I
are gonna wait for you outside.

1:34:03.202 --> 1:34:04.726
Come on, Brynn,
let's go outside.

1:34:08.730 --> 1:34:10.557
Charlotte, you were saying?

1:34:10.601 --> 1:34:14.648
So, after Gina
put his body into the lake,

1:34:14.692 --> 1:34:16.781
she lost the tie
and lost the earrings.

1:34:16.825 --> 1:34:19.001
And that's when
Brynn came and found them.

1:34:19.044 --> 1:34:23.701
Your evidence does
suggest that she's guilty.
But what's her motive?

1:34:23.745 --> 1:34:27.923
Easy. Everyone at the club
has seen how Gina chases
after the wealthy man.

1:34:27.966 --> 1:34:30.925
She finally caught one,
or so she thought.

1:34:30.969 --> 1:34:35.103
Harley must have betrayed her,
and she turned to a jilted
lover, green with envy.

1:34:35.147 --> 1:34:37.584
She wanted to be
the new Mrs. Trudeau.

1:34:37.628 --> 1:34:40.500
You form a convincing theory,
Charlotte.

1:34:40.544 --> 1:34:44.374
So good in fact,
I'd say it matches nicely
with our own findings.

1:34:44.416 --> 1:34:47.464
Well, what about Carlos Harris?
Did he help Gina? I mean,

1:34:47.507 --> 1:34:50.335
Charlotte saw his cart all
beat-up with blood all over it.

1:34:50.380 --> 1:34:54.166
Carlos reported that he hit
a deer with his cart a week ago.

1:34:55.210 --> 1:34:56.473
His story checks out.

1:34:57.909 --> 1:35:01.521
So, I sent Sergeant Hart
to take a visit to the dump.

1:35:03.175 --> 1:35:06.657
Beer cart number two was found
behind the trash heap.

1:35:06.701 --> 1:35:10.487
And it had the damage you would
expect from hitting Harley.

1:35:10.530 --> 1:35:13.359

to the station tomorrow

1:38:06.445 --> 1:38:07.751
[phone beeping]

1:38:11.581 --> 1:38:15.019
[loud upbeat music playing]

1:38:49.793 --> 1:38:51.142
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:39:04.851 --> 1:39:07.898
[loud upbeat music continues]

1:39:31.878 --> 1:39:34.142
-Oh, guys!
-Going somewhere, Foster?

1:39:34.184 --> 1:39:35.404
[Foster]
Hold on. Whoa.

1:39:36.927 --> 1:39:39.321
-Stop.
-[Tanner] Why don't you
take a seat?

1:39:42.063 --> 1:39:44.674
Looks like you've had
quite a night, Mr. Davis?

1:39:46.241 --> 1:39:48.591
Where's Winona Trudeau?

1:39:48.634 --> 1:39:49.940
I don't know!

1:39:50.941 --> 1:39:52.898
Like, she left
about 20 minutes ago.

1:39:52.943 --> 1:39:55.076
She's getting away.
She's the one you want.

1:39:55.119 --> 1:39:57.034
Better put an APB out on her.

1:39:59.123 --> 1:40:02.474
You know, we've been talking to
Gina Young down at the station.

1:40:02.518 --> 1:40:05.260
I swear, I had nothing
to do with Harley's death.

1:40:05.303 --> 1:40:06.782
Winona fooled me too.

1:40:06.826 --> 1:40:08.741
Is that right?

1:40:08.785 --> 1:40:10.960
It looks like she left you
a nice little parting gift,

1:40:11.005 --> 1:40:12.353
all wrapped in ribbon.

1:40:12.397 --> 1:40:14.878
Take it.
I want nothing to do with this.

1:40:14.921 --> 1:40:16.227
[Bud]
Alright, Mr. Davis.

1:40:18.099 --> 1:40:20.623
How about you give us
a short version of
what went on here tonight?

1:40:20.666 --> 1:40:22.451
Winona tricked me.

1:40:22.494 --> 1:40:24.322
I thought
we were playing a game.

1:40:24.366 --> 1:40:26.237
Next thing I know,
I'm tied to a chair

1:40:26.281 --> 1:40:28.065
and she's pointing a gun at me.

1:40:28.109 --> 1:40:29.849
[chuckles]

1:40:29.893 --> 1:40:32.068
What, you didn't see
that one coming?

1:40:32.112 --> 1:40:33.114
Continue.

1:40:34.289 --> 1:40:36.682
Winona has said that
about a month ago,

1:40:36.726 --> 1:40:39.946
Harley told her
he was going divorce her
and marry his secretary.

1:40:39.990 --> 1:40:41.687
Winona signed a prenup.

1:40:41.731 --> 1:40:44.342
And over the years, Larson
lost favor with his daddy.

1:40:44.386 --> 1:40:46.692
So she was determined
to do whatever it took

1:40:46.736 --> 1:40:48.433
to maintain their lifestyle.

1:40:48.477 --> 1:40:50.478
How'd Gina Young get involved?

1:40:50.522 --> 1:40:52.959
Winona said that her revenge
will be even sweeter

1:40:53.003 --> 1:40:55.309
if she had one of Harley's
flings do the dirty work.

1:40:55.353 --> 1:40:57.964
She said, she was killing
two birds with one stone.

1:40:58.008 --> 1:40:59.531
So, she approached Gina.

1:40:59.575 --> 1:41:01.577
And you had no part in this?

1:41:01.620 --> 1:41:03.231
No, I didn't!

1:41:04.362 --> 1:41:07.757
Winona told Gina that Harley
has been cheating on her.

1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:10.325
And how he's planning
to run off with his latest
flavor of the month.

1:41:10.368 --> 1:41:12.240
That was enough
to fuel the fire.

1:41:12.282 --> 1:41:14.329
I mean, Gina went nuts!

1:41:14.371 --> 1:41:16.418
Then all Winona had to do

1:41:16.460 --> 1:41:18.159
was offer to pay Gina
to kill him.

1:41:18.202 --> 1:41:20.117
And that was enough
to seal his fate.

1:41:20.161 --> 1:41:22.684
Did she tell you the plan?

1:41:22.728 --> 1:41:26.384
Just said, Winona made sure
the drinks kept flowing
to Harley's direction

1:41:26.428 --> 1:41:28.647
last Friday
at the club cocktail.

1:41:28.691 --> 1:41:31.563
She knew he'd get drunk
and that they'd get fighting,

1:41:31.607 --> 1:41:34.871
and then he'd go looking
for Gina after he dropped
her off at home.

1:41:34.914 --> 1:41:37.568
And sure enough,
he found Gina leaving the club.

1:41:38.788 --> 1:41:41.746
Then... Gina took him
for a ride on the beer cart.

1:41:41.791 --> 1:41:44.663
She pushed him out of the cart,
and he's stumbling around,

1:41:44.707 --> 1:41:48.189
so she chases him down into
the sand pit and runs him over.

1:41:48.232 --> 1:41:51.931
According to Winona,
one groan and he's gone.

1:41:51.975 --> 1:41:53.889
That sounds about right.

1:41:53.933 --> 1:41:55.370
Don't you think so, Tanner?

1:41:55.413 --> 1:41:57.763
I'd say so.

1:41:57.807 --> 1:42:00.070
Same story Gina
told us at the station.

1:42:01.157 --> 1:42:03.334
You're a lucky man, Foster.

1:42:03.378 --> 1:42:08.644
You got an alibi.
Gina claims Winona didn't
want you mixed up in all this.

1:42:08.687 --> 1:42:10.514
Thank God.

1:42:11.777 --> 1:42:13.910
[Bud]
That's all for tonight,
Mr. Davis.

1:42:14.954 --> 1:42:17.653
But I'm gonna need you
to come down to the station
in the morning

1:42:17.696 --> 1:42:20.264
to give us your full statement.

1:42:20.308 --> 1:42:21.960
Tanner.

1:42:22.005 --> 1:42:23.659
Collect that for me, will you?

1:42:23.702 --> 1:42:25.661
Yes, sir. Mm.

1:42:37.368 --> 1:42:38.456
Toodles, Foster.

1:42:45.376 --> 1:42:48.423
[upbeat music]

1:43:24.110 --> 1:43:25.068
[sighs]

1:43:33.728 --> 1:43:34.991
[phone beeping]

1:43:40.996 --> 1:43:41.998
[chuckles]

1:44:19.601 --> 1:44:20.602
[screaming]

1:44:21.951 --> 1:44:24.996
[upbeat music continues]

1:44:48.847 --> 1:44:51.850
[calm music]
