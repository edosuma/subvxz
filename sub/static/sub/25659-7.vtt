17:37.280 --> 17:38.680
t of Blake's injuries, anything.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.440
ill if you tell me what's going.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.200
e dealing with a man who will go
lengths to get what he wants...

17:46.400 --> 17:48.000
You think he set it up?

17:48.400 --> 17:51.440
easier to escape from a hospital
it is a maximum-security prison.

17:52.520 --> 17:53.720
Straight on it, please.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.680
Ready, yeah.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.600
Hey.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.320
-You heard about Blake?
-Yeah.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.720
I could develop an affection
for "alternative justice".

18:41.760 --> 18:44.200
-Yeah, if that's what it is.
-What do you mean?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.360
've just had the incident report
sent over from the prison.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.200
And?

18:49.240 --> 18:51.520
of the attack are not consistent
with Blake's injuries.

18:51.560 --> 18:55.160
s, it looks like all the reports
have been written by one person.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.280
-[phone vibrating]
-It doesn't add up. Sorry.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.320
Steve Orwell.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.360
o Blake gets so badly beaten up,
ey have to move him to hospital.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.720
those reports were pre-written.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.240
's an escape plan, it has to be.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.600
ey're taking him from the prison
to the East London Hospital...

19:10.640 --> 19:14.080
Harry, whatever you're planning,
st think long and hard about it.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.160
Trust me, I have.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.360
ght, well, then, leave it to me.
I'll take it from here.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.520
[Harry] The overpass, that's it.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.000
What overpass?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.560
Harry?

19:24.600 --> 19:26.400
ill call Gray, we will intercept
the ambulance

19:26.440 --> 19:28.480
top this before it begins, okay?

19:31.040 --> 19:32.240
Harry?

19:36.200 --> 19:38.360
This is Steve Orwell, MIS.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.280
e route for the ambulance taking l Blake from Southcliffe Prison.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.400

20:39.400 --> 20:40.400

20:41.280 --> 20:42.280
Pull over!

20:47.160 --> 20:49.080
units to the Stratford Overpass.

20:49.120 --> 20:52.000
I repeat, all units
to the Stratford Overpass.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.640
Pull over!

20:57.440 --> 20:58.680
Oh, fuck it!

21:52.200 --> 21:53.360
Harry!

21:55.240 --> 21:56.200
Harry. Wait!

21:59.240 --> 22:00.360

Check the driver.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.760

22:24.280 --> 22:26.040
Contusions, probable concussion.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.240
[grunts]

22:28.720 --> 22:29.640
Blake?

22:31.040 --> 22:32.000
He's dead.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.600
Oh, what have you done?

22:52.400 --> 22:53.480
[Gray] Steve.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.800
ran the ambulance off the road.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.800
I'm watching them drag
Blake's body out right now.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.600
Where are you?

23:01.200 --> 23:02.320
[Orwell] Looking for Harry.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.240
ll go down for this, guaranteed.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.040
I'll see you later.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.000
asn't meant to happen like that.

23:19.240 --> 23:21.120
'll make great defence in court.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.080
have to take you in now, Harry.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.400
I know. I know.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.240
t listen, Steve, please, just...

23:31.040 --> 23:32.240
Hear me out, please.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.160
-Harry.
-I found this in the ambulance.

23:34.200 --> 23:37.480
"Cara Gibson." That was the name
rison nurse that was attacked...

23:38.280 --> 23:40.680
The description of her attacker,
it fits Eve perfectly.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.680
nto prison to help Blake escape,
she was in that ambulance.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.600
Blake is dead. You want Eve.
I can get her for you.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.720
But I've just got one last thing
I need to do.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.560
-Harry.
-Then I'll hand myself in.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.560
You have my word.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.040
You've got 24 hours.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.360
24 hours!

24:40.440 --> 24:41.560
Yeah.

24:48.200 --> 24:51.480
t's the bracelet's doing, Harry,
not yours.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.000
[Harry] Maybe.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.480
Dead enough for you?

24:57.320 --> 24:59.560
He looks sufficiently deceased.

25:02.160 --> 25:06.400
You'll be dead just like him,
if the bracelet has its own way.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.000
Find Eve.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.440
Bring the other bracelet to me.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.280
ry] Eve was under Blake's spell.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.160
Now he's dead, she'll see sense.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.720
e quick about it, if I were you.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.600
rwell] Someone's starting early.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.040
it's been a very stressful day.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.360
rry really has surpassed himself
this time.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.080
Yeah.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.000
I wouldn't argue with that.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.640
o, I take it you didn't catch up
with him, then?

25:47.200 --> 25:48.800
Gave me the slip.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.000
And you haven't spoken to him
nce he created all this carnage?

25:51.200 --> 25:53.240
-No.
-Would you tell me if you had?

25:54.400 --> 25:55.400
Of course I would.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.200
escalated the manhunt for Harry.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.320
You're the one person
he's most likely to contact.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.400
If he gets in touch,
you'll be first to know.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.600
e needs protecting from himself.

26:09.240 --> 26:11.440
Harry took Suri's death
very personally, ma'am.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.480
Alexandri just as much as we do.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.080
Harry.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.560
You?

26:35.520 --> 26:38.040
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't kill you right now?

26:39.640 --> 26:41.000
Maybe this?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.040
All I can say is, I'm sorry.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.080
Sorry?

26:47.680 --> 26:48.720
For everything.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.280
new how much Suri meant to you--

26:51.320 --> 26:52.680
Don't fucking say her name.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.600
-Blake got inside my head.
-Lies!

26:58.240 --> 26:59.640
You might not believe me.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.400
w you're never gonna forgive me.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.480
But I'm truly sorry.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.800
When that bullet hit Suri...

27:08.040 --> 27:09.560
So, why try and help Blake
escape from prison?

27:10.320 --> 27:11.640
You don't understand.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.680
You don't understand the control
he had over me.

27:13.720 --> 27:16.800
I always tried to protect you,
en when you cursed me with this.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.080
That's not fair.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.200
You were already broken
when we found each other.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.040
We both were...

27:24.720 --> 27:26.240
We did good things together.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.000
We made a difference.

27:30.720 --> 27:34.320
re's no way back for me and you,
I understand that.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.160
I want to give this to you.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.720
Take it to Madame Cheung.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.400
There's been enough death.
ry, I don't want you to be next.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.760
When this thing comes off...

27:54.160 --> 27:55.520
you stay away from me.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.400
For the last time, Eve.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.360
Goodbye.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.200
[gasps]

28:57.560 --> 28:58.760
[grunts]

30:18.200 --> 30:19.400
You spoke with Eve?

30:25.200 --> 30:26.200
Is she okay?

30:27.720 --> 30:31.040
Forgive me if Eve's wellbeing
he top of my list of priorities.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.200
Answer the question.

30:34.480 --> 30:38.400
And remember,
aven't removed the bracelet yet.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.440
-We had...
-A deal.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.000
I know.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.200
And I am very keen to honour it.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.440
must know, she looked terrible.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.040
Like a lost kid.

30:52.800 --> 30:56.280
But she gave you the bracelet
of her own free will?

30:57.160 --> 30:58.320
I suppose she did.

31:00.120 --> 31:03.000
o Blake's spell has been lifted.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.560
You'd have to ask her that.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.000
Now, if you don't mind...

31:11.120 --> 31:12.680
can you get this thing off me?

31:19.720 --> 31:21.760
[chanting]

31:40.760 --> 31:42.400
It's over, Harry.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.800
What now for you?

31:50.200 --> 31:53.000
I think I might be looking
at a different kind of bracelet.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.200
[sobs]

32:16.360 --> 32:18.000
I wasn't sure I'd see you again.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.240
Clayton's handiwork.

32:21.160 --> 32:22.160
You knew?

32:23.600 --> 32:24.800
I suspected.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.240
Nice of him to make my death
look so convincing.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.280
[she sighs]

32:53.400 --> 32:55.280
Where have you been?
You said a few minutes.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.120
Well, I'm here now.

32:58.160 --> 33:01.120
-I'll leave you guys to it.
-No, no, no. Hear me out.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.320
I've done something.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.160
might call it incredibly stupid.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.600
You might think it's incredibly
necessary, but I've done it.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.720
you're going to talk in riddles
all night?

33:11.760 --> 33:13.240
Whoa, whoa...

33:16.080 --> 33:18.280
am so sorry for abandoning you,

33:18.320 --> 33:20.800
you've pulled out all the stops
to get back here.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.440
Daisy, having you home...

33:25.240 --> 33:26.200
[sighs]

33:26.240 --> 33:27.280
it's all I've ever wanted.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.400
ease believe me when I say that.

33:30.680 --> 33:31.640
Dad.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.000
The bracelet...

33:38.600 --> 33:39.600
has gone.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.000
[Harry] Pssh!

33:42.280 --> 33:43.240
No way.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.680
Will you give me another chance?

33:48.400 --> 33:49.400
Please.

33:50.600 --> 33:51.800
Both of you.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.200
Hmm?

34:18.400 --> 34:19.800
[indistinct chatter in Chinese]

34:43.560 --> 34:44.600
Don't move!

35:00.200 --> 35:01.320
[knock]

35:22.800 --> 35:24.160
[Cheung sighs]

35:24.200 --> 35:26.080
We're back to bowing again?

35:30.800 --> 35:34.720
Cheung] Keeping such bad company
takes its toll on the spirit.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.080
[Eve] Samuel Blake is dead.

35:37.480 --> 35:39.360
heung] Hmm... I'm aware of that.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.360
And you've decided
you want redemption after all?

35:47.480 --> 35:49.040
I don't know what I want.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.400
I've messed up...

35:53.240 --> 35:54.360
I know.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.280
You see all this time, Dais...

36:00.360 --> 36:02.400
I thought the bracelet
would make my life easier...

36:03.200 --> 36:04.320
Better.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.000
It made everything worse.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.520
It made me worse.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.120
[Rich] Harry.

36:19.400 --> 36:20.520
Harry...

36:21.400 --> 36:22.480
What have you done?

36:30.280 --> 36:35.600
I've told you before.
isn't a fight you can run from.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.440
You may have come home, but...

36:40.320 --> 36:45.800
y a few hours ago that you swore
allegiance to Samuel Blake.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.640
Aiya...

36:50.480 --> 36:53.200
Snakes don't even have hands.

36:57.560 --> 36:59.520
given Harry the second bracelet.

37:01.160 --> 37:02.560
What more do you want from me?

37:03.640 --> 37:07.080
, that was an important gesture.

37:07.680 --> 37:10.200
ve you removed Harry's bracelet?

37:12.400 --> 37:15.560
Why are you still so concerned
with Harry Clayton?

37:16.360 --> 37:19.080
re the last of the Torches, Eve.

37:19.600 --> 37:25.040
hen I'm no longer on this Earth,
all my powers will pass to you.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.680
[Cheung] I need to be sure
your intentions are pure.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.720
Oh, I'd say her intentions
are definitely pure.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.200
Sure?

37:44.640 --> 37:45.600
[sighs]

37:47.360 --> 37:51.000
Well, I can't imagine many tears
will be shed over Samuel Blake.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.640
No, probably not.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.080
But it was Eve Alexandri
who pulled that trigger.

37:58.280 --> 37:59.480
It's her we want now.

38:00.200 --> 38:01.200
And we'll get her...

38:02.200 --> 38:03.200
Her and Harry.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.200
I'm afraid he's just...

38:06.520 --> 38:09.080
-[phone vibrating]
-Just gone too far this time.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.600
Is that him?

38:12.080 --> 38:13.080
Steve Orwell.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.560
Blake's not dead.

38:25.280 --> 38:26.200
What?

38:33.200 --> 38:34.520
[phone vibrating]

38:36.560 --> 38:38.480
-Steve?
-[Orwell] Harry.

38:38.800 --> 38:42.240
led a pathologist and walked out mortuary about half an hour ago.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.120
Blake!

39:17.280 --> 39:18.400
Hello, Harry.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.360
You were dead.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.200
I saw it with my own eyes.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.040
Death and resurrection...

39:27.440 --> 39:29.560
ll with some medical assistance,
of course.

39:31.560 --> 39:33.440
When you gave me that bracelet,
you were lying.

39:34.480 --> 39:35.640
It was all lies.

39:39.360 --> 39:41.560
Just as we expected, you came
straight to Madame Cheung

39:41.600 --> 39:43.480
very obligingly took yours off.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.640
And I was more than happy
to relieve her of both of them.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.000
Now, lower your gun...

39:51.320 --> 39:52.480
Or she dies.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.440
I won't ask you again, Harry.

39:58.760 --> 39:59.640
Eve.

40:01.200 --> 40:04.680
I don't believe you
ve truly settled on this path...

40:08.480 --> 40:09.720
Do as he says, Harry.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.360
u helped him escape from prison.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.200
so he could have the bracelets.

40:17.680 --> 40:22.440
erhaps it will take the ultimate
rifice for you to see the truth.

40:24.480 --> 40:25.400
Wait!

40:35.200 --> 40:36.240
Well done, Harry.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.680
, it is time to simplify things.

40:40.720 --> 40:41.640
[screams] No!

40:44.240 --> 40:46.320
Deaths keep coming to people
you care about.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.800
Even without that black bracelet
on your wrist.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.520
[gunshots continue]

41:40.200 --> 41:41.400
Nowhere left to run, Harry.
