So every time you have a crisis,
the sickled blood cells

11:26.594 --> 11:28.669
block blood flow
to the hip bone right here.

11:28.838 --> 11:30.430
Over time,
that bone starts to die.

11:30.598 --> 11:33.766
We call it avascular necrosis.
It's why you're in so much pain.

11:33.919 --> 11:35.676
Okay, so we treat the pain,

11:35.770 --> 11:37.770
get me back on my feet,
I go back to PT.

11:37.939 --> 11:40.014
Well, I'm afraid pain management
and PT aren't gonna cut it,

11:40.108 --> 11:41.700
and that's why
I brought in Dr. Voss

11:41.851 --> 11:43.443
-to see you.
-I'm sorry, Rose,

11:43.595 --> 11:45.019
but you're gonna need
a hip replacement.

11:45.113 --> 11:47.080
(pager beeping)

11:47.949 --> 11:50.041
Sorry, I have to get this.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.751
Let me know what you decide.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.458
I'm not doing the surgery.
The risks are too high.

11:58.626 --> 12:00.719
I know it's scary,
but a hip replacement

12:00.870 --> 12:03.871
-is your best option, Rose.
-Doctors never get it.

12:03.965 --> 12:05.706
You're the ones
with the medical degrees,

12:05.726 --> 12:07.800
but I have to school you
on my disease.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.562
-It's exhausting.
-I know from personal experience

12:10.731 --> 12:12.731
that many patients of color
aren't heard.

12:12.882 --> 12:15.458
Chastain is different.
I'm different.

12:15.627 --> 12:17.736
Help me understand.

12:17.887 --> 12:21.314
Surgery for sickle cell patients
is even riskier.

12:21.466 --> 12:24.317
You could fix my hip
but leave me with other issues.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.636
Tell me I won't have
an anemia crisis

12:26.654 --> 12:30.397
or a cardiac crisis or worse.

12:30.492 --> 12:33.159
I can't imagine the pain
you've endured, and I understand

12:33.253 --> 12:35.161
why you are reluctant
to think more time in a hospital

12:35.255 --> 12:38.147
-would help you. I get it.
-It's more than just that.

12:38.316 --> 12:41.317
It's about how I want
to live my life.

12:41.486 --> 12:44.262
I'm a dancer.

12:44.431 --> 12:47.248
Was a dancer.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.768
When the pain got to be so bad
that I had to stop,

12:50.028 --> 12:52.996
I put all of my savings
into a studio.

12:53.164 --> 12:55.832
Now I teach dance
to high-risk kids.

12:55.850 --> 12:59.903
Tonight they have a recital
to showcase all their hard work.

13:00.855 --> 13:04.507
Those girls, they're my life.

13:04.676 --> 13:06.910
And I want to be there tonight.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.696
I'd rather limp and be alive
than die sooner

13:10.865 --> 13:12.749
because of a surgery.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.294
Your hip is about shot.

13:16.521 --> 13:19.689
I want to do it today because
it's best that we take advantage

13:19.858 --> 13:22.525
of this window
while you're relatively well.

13:22.694 --> 13:24.710
Because during
a sickle cell crisis,

13:24.863 --> 13:26.896
there would be such
a high possibility

13:27.032 --> 13:28.789
of a fatal blood vessel blockage

13:28.809 --> 13:31.768
that a surgery would be
even more dangerous.

13:33.705 --> 13:36.055
So, Rose, let me help you.

13:36.207 --> 13:38.374
We will do everything we can
to keep you safe.

Dr. Hawkins is requesting
you personally.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.675
MINA:
Conrad seldom does this.

14:03.902 --> 14:05.326
Whoever the patient is
must be special.

14:05.494 --> 14:07.904
AUSTIN:
Which is why I have to go.

14:08.073 --> 14:09.330
But we're fine here.
I'll step out for a minute,

14:09.498 --> 14:11.941

and be back the moment I'm done.

-AUSTIN: Hemothorax?
-Drained about 750cc's
in the left chest.

14:42.123 --> 14:43.715
It was likely a rupture
to his diaphragm.

14:43.866 --> 14:46.384
-Oh...
-That's more blood
than we'd like.

14:46.535 --> 14:47.886
I need to get him to the OR.

14:50.465 --> 14:52.949
His vitals are stable.
Stop by CT first?

14:53.042 --> 14:54.726
Yeah. We'll get X-ray

Hey. Talk to me. What's wrong?

15:38.254 --> 15:41.588
Nate's chest,
it shouldn't be clear.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.999
-Why?
-There should be

15:43.017 --> 15:45.168
a bullet

-there isn't.
