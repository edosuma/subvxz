00:16.909 --> 00:18.784
(Jane) No, please, you can't die.

00:28.186 --> 00:29.018
(Weller) Hey.

00:29.065 --> 00:29.654
(Bill) Where is she?

00:29.693 --> 00:32.718
It's me. Wha... What did I do?

00:32.813 --> 00:34.639
She's under the fort, Kurt.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.828
It was an accident.

00:35.899 --> 00:37.751
I didn't mean to... I didn't...

00:37.814 --> 00:39.734
She was so small.

00:41.261 --> 00:43.222
(Weller) Who's under the fort, Dad?

00:43.949 --> 00:45.489
Taylor.

00:45.904 --> 00:47.296
Her body.

00:47.423 --> 00:49.398
(Weller) What are you talking about, Dad?

00:49.484 --> 00:51.366
(Bill) I killed her, son.

00:51.463 --> 00:55.265
I killed Taylor Shaw.

00:56.542 --> 00:58.475
(shower running)

01:14.346 --> 01:16.765
(Weller) He said something
right before he passed.

01:16.828 --> 01:18.311
A confession.

01:19.242 --> 01:20.573
It doesn't make any sense.

01:20.628 --> 01:24.072
He seemed... so lucid.

01:24.164 --> 01:25.909
But what he was saying...

01:25.995 --> 01:28.408
What happens to the mind as it's dying?

01:28.479 --> 01:30.888
Is it possible that he...

01:30.950 --> 01:34.084
Well, it's possible that
your father was delusional,

01:34.162 --> 01:36.405
that, as his brain and
body were shutting down,

01:36.452 --> 01:38.718
his synapses were firing
in such a way as to make him

01:38.764 --> 01:40.257
see or say things that weren't real.

01:40.312 --> 01:42.029
That's certainly very common.

01:42.916 --> 01:44.452
Or...

01:44.799 --> 01:46.788
He could have been telling you the truth.

01:46.833 --> 01:48.679
Honestly, Kurt, if anyone could judge

01:48.749 --> 01:51.407
whether or not your father was lucid,

01:51.514 --> 01:53.422
it would probably be you.

01:54.622 --> 01:56.736
So what does your gut tell you?

02:04.549 --> 02:06.558
- You guys heard from Jane?
- No.

02:06.623 --> 02:07.647
She's not answering her phone.

02:07.709 --> 02:10.407
She doesn't have to, right?
She doesn't work here anymore.

02:10.479 --> 02:12.789
Is something wrong?

02:12.921 --> 02:13.529
I gotta go.

02:13.531 --> 02:14.988
Wait, why? Allie's coming in to talk...

02:15.035 --> 02:17.050
My father died last night.

02:17.344 --> 02:19.316
I gotta... I gotta go.

02:26.744 --> 02:28.825
Kurt, it's fine, we got this.

02:28.903 --> 02:30.397
Do you want someone to go with you?

02:30.489 --> 02:32.947
No, no, I'm good. You stay here.

02:33.045 --> 02:34.777
I gotta take care of something.

02:45.675 --> 02:46.727
(Weller) Jane?

03:18.612 --> 03:20.144
(gunshot)

03:39.020 --> 03:40.379
(Oscar) I can't lose you.

03:40.450 --> 03:41.369
We've talked about this.

03:41.435 --> 03:42.439
No, you've talked about it!

03:42.498 --> 03:43.458
I...

03:43.488 --> 03:44.480
Why does it have to be you?

03:44.534 --> 03:47.160
- You know why.
- I love you.

03:47.239 --> 03:49.874
And I love you, more than anything,

03:49.944 --> 03:51.660
but this is bigger than all of us.

03:51.723 --> 03:54.435
Please, don't let him
inject you with that poison.

03:54.513 --> 03:56.530
What if you don't come back?
Have you thought about that?

03:56.584 --> 03:57.944
That's a risk every solider takes.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.575
That's not what I mean, and you know it.

03:59.666 --> 04:02.925
What if you... you don't come back, ever?

04:03.050 --> 04:04.582
What happens then?

04:08.325 --> 04:09.840
I think we need to talk to Shepherd.

04:09.929 --> 04:11.446
- No, no, that's...
- Yes.

04:11.532 --> 04:12.996
This was a mistake.

04:13.077 --> 04:15.296
I don't think you should be my handler.

04:27.918 --> 04:29.547
(Jane) You're my starting point.

04:29.629 --> 04:30.973
(Patterson) She was born in Africa.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.892
(Weller) No, she was born in Pennsylvania.

04:32.986 --> 04:34.210
I was there the day they brought her home.

04:34.305 --> 04:36.395
The DNA results directly contradict

04:36.473 --> 04:37.460
the isotope test.

04:37.521 --> 04:39.253
(Weller) Is she Taylor Shaw or not?

04:45.152 --> 04:46.363
(Allie) Really?

04:46.457 --> 04:48.939
Mayfair hasn't reached out to any of you?

04:49.055 --> 04:51.033
I find that very hard to believe.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.596
Mayfair is innocent, and she's smart.

04:54.689 --> 04:57.180
Do you really think she
would call the FBI if she ran?

04:57.258 --> 04:58.779
She hacked her ankle monitor.

04:58.833 --> 05:00.523
She's desperate, and she's on the run.

05:00.593 --> 05:02.871
Desperate people do stupid things.

05:03.037 --> 05:03.721
(sighs)

05:03.784 --> 05:07.174
Look, I like you guys.

05:07.303 --> 05:09.027
I do.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.387
Which is why I'm giving
you this one last chance,

05:12.538 --> 05:14.402
'cause if I find out later that
you've kept something from me,

05:14.493 --> 05:17.187
you are all going down
for aiding and abetting.

05:18.412 --> 05:20.240
We like you, too, Allie.

05:21.492 --> 05:23.025
We'll let you know if she reaches out.

05:26.915 --> 05:28.282
Okay.

05:32.325 --> 05:33.957
Can you believe her?

05:39.697 --> 05:41.320
(Sarah) No, it's crazy.

05:41.443 --> 05:43.002
That's what he said, Sarah.

05:43.096 --> 05:44.630
Well, then who is she?

05:44.857 --> 05:46.474
- If Jane isn't...
- I don't know!

05:46.663 --> 05:47.572
That's the problem.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.647
What about the scar on her
neck from when we were kids?

05:49.717 --> 05:51.615
What about her DNA? You
said her DNA was a match.

05:51.661 --> 05:52.742
I know what I said!

05:52.852 --> 05:56.558
But what he said was,
"She's under the fort."

05:56.620 --> 05:58.812
I think he buried her under
the old fort in that backyard.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.085
His body was shutting down, okay?

06:01.181 --> 06:03.545
Who knows what was going
on inside of his head?

06:03.615 --> 06:05.328
Think about it... it doesn't make sense.

06:05.438 --> 06:07.896
Why would he bury her in our backyard?

06:07.998 --> 06:09.586
His shoes were muddy that night.

06:09.656 --> 06:12.304
If you kill a girl, you don't
bury her in your own backyard!

06:12.382 --> 06:13.745
If that's what you've done,

06:13.808 --> 06:15.663
if that's really the kind
of person that you are,

06:15.747 --> 06:17.030
there's no telling what else you might do.

06:17.109 --> 06:18.925
Okay, wait, the cops
searched the whole place.

06:18.980 --> 06:20.601
They turned the whole place upside-down.

06:20.687 --> 06:23.765
They never looked under the fort, did they?

06:23.957 --> 06:25.985
So there's only one way to be sure.

06:26.077 --> 06:28.356
I'm driving to Clearfield.

06:28.469 --> 06:30.222
I have to see if she's there.

06:32.099 --> 06:33.766
Then I'm going with you.

06:35.593 --> 06:36.667
Fine.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.610
Let's settle this once and for all.

Hi, Ana.

07:02.482 --> 07:04.032
What are you...

07:04.208 --> 07:05.326
Is something wrong?

07:05.377 --> 07:06.316
Yeah.

07:06.417 --> 07:07.635
I need your help.

07:07.703 --> 07:08.884
Come in.

07:12.408 --> 07:16.310
I have a number someone gave
me, in case of emergencies.

07:16.379 --> 07:19.813
He's a... a go-between for...

07:21.544 --> 07:22.257
For?

07:22.343 --> 07:23.654
Look, I want to keep you out of this

07:23.717 --> 07:25.545
as much as possible, okay?

07:25.631 --> 07:28.397
I have a number. I need you to trace it.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.156
That's all you really need to know.

07:30.211 --> 07:31.123
I'm happy to do this for you,

07:31.209 --> 07:33.459
but this is something
Patterson can do in her sleep.

07:33.581 --> 07:37.197
Someone I trusted did something horrible.

07:37.265 --> 07:38.831
(gunshot)

07:40.386 --> 07:43.202
I don't know who I can trust anymore.

07:43.626 --> 07:45.632
I don't even know if I can trust myself.

07:45.694 --> 07:47.406
I need to bring this guy in.

07:47.474 --> 07:49.007
I need your help.

07:49.076 --> 07:50.576
Can you help me?

07:51.757 --> 07:53.024
Let me get set up.

07:58.229 --> 08:00.797
(Zapata) Have you heard from Mayfair
since she called you yesterday?

08:01.991 --> 08:03.421
Me, neither.

08:03.643 --> 08:05.258
We gotta go check out that address.

08:05.344 --> 08:06.161
She's trying to keep us out of this.

08:06.224 --> 08:08.726
Yeah, well, she's not
doing a great job, is she?

08:08.874 --> 08:10.701
- I don't know.
- If the roles were reversed,

08:10.765 --> 08:14.028
you think Mayfair would just
stand here and do nothing?

08:21.080 --> 08:22.562
You coming or what?

08:27.144 --> 08:28.685
(Sarah) Dad, Taylor's alive.

08:28.766 --> 08:30.184
(Patterson) Her DNA is a match.

08:30.282 --> 08:31.949
You are Taylor Shaw.

08:32.043 --> 08:33.630
Did we used to go fishing?

08:34.511 --> 08:37.053
Jane remembers fishing in Anderson Creek.

08:37.155 --> 08:39.457
Her DNA matches Taylor's.

08:39.614 --> 08:42.836
Dad was on a lot of morphine, so...

08:44.785 --> 08:47.119
Maybe his mind was playing tricks on him.

08:48.913 --> 08:50.114
Or...

08:51.347 --> 08:52.947
Maybe mine was.

08:55.353 --> 08:56.711
Kurt, I know you.

08:57.574 --> 08:59.525
Okay, you're just gonna keep
turning this over in your head

08:59.588 --> 09:01.376
for the rest of your life.

09:01.527 --> 09:03.257
It's gonna affect your
relationship with me,

09:03.372 --> 09:05.638
Sawyer, Taylor.

09:06.746 --> 09:09.135
We need to see what's under that fort.

09:13.690 --> 09:15.884
Okay, now, that number
you're using is a burner, too,

09:15.963 --> 09:17.557
so you're gonna have to
keep him online long enough

09:17.626 --> 09:19.006
for me to triangulate his location

09:19.069 --> 09:21.041
based on cell phone towers.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.095
Got it?

09:22.211 --> 09:23.476
Yeah, got it.

09:24.299 --> 09:25.798
Okay.

09:25.928 --> 09:27.456
Ready when you are.

09:39.197 --> 09:41.594
<i>I'm afraid that's not
possible right now.</i>

09:41.977 --> 09:45.149
Wait, I... I was told I could
call and cancel any time.

09:45.196 --> 09:46.780
<i>It's been a busy day
for us, a lot of orders.</i>

09:46.841 --> 09:49.666
- You know who this is, right?
- And you know who this is!

09:49.728 --> 09:51.022
<i>There are rules.</i>

09:51.273 --> 09:52.232
(whispering) Okay, got it.

09:52.310 --> 09:53.205
(phone beeps off)

09:53.268 --> 09:54.927
Jane, who are these people?

09:55.067 --> 09:57.494
For your own safety, I can't.

09:59.052 --> 10:00.282
I owe you one.

10:00.441 --> 10:02.399
You saved my life.

10:02.544 --> 10:04.577
I'd say I still owe you a few.

10:08.595 --> 10:11.238
(Zapata) What was Mayfair looking for here?

10:11.369 --> 10:12.119
(Reade) You smell that?

10:12.197 --> 10:13.409
(Zapata) Bleach.

10:13.495 --> 10:14.680
Yeah, lots of it.

10:14.824 --> 10:16.541
(Zapata) Spring cleaning?

10:16.709 --> 10:18.721
(Reade) I'd say they missed a couple spots.

10:18.846 --> 10:20.852
Somebody tried to clean something.

10:21.073 --> 10:22.671
And recently.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.773
Hey, I think I got something.

10:38.689 --> 10:39.326
(grunting)

10:39.396 --> 10:41.553
Hey, can you lift this for me?

10:41.655 --> 10:42.704
(creaking)

10:42.773 --> 10:44.081
- (grunts)
- Thanks.

10:45.156 --> 10:47.130
A shell casing.

10:47.224 --> 10:48.876
What the hell happened here?

10:49.307 --> 10:51.073
We need a CSU.

10:51.328 --> 10:52.482
Oh, yeah?

10:52.761 --> 10:54.493
And what do we tell them?

10:56.140 --> 10:57.082
Fine.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.012
Then we need Patterson.

11:01.635 --> 11:03.401
(door creaks)

11:12.354 --> 11:14.967
(child's echoing laughter)

11:15.128 --> 11:16.962
(Sarah) Hey. You okay?

11:18.548 --> 11:20.783
Yeah. Yeah.

11:20.861 --> 11:22.847
This place looks exactly the same.

11:23.054 --> 11:24.784
How long has it been
since you've been here?

11:24.895 --> 11:26.645
Couple of decades.

11:28.694 --> 11:30.300
Let's get this over with.

11:30.585 --> 11:32.148
(Zapata) So what do you think?

11:32.217 --> 11:33.455
(spraying)

11:33.525 --> 11:35.788
Hey, Patterson, how we doing?

11:36.624 --> 11:37.547
The silent treatment, really?

11:37.617 --> 11:38.528
That's how we're playing this?

11:38.614 --> 11:39.646
We said we were sorry.

11:39.732 --> 11:41.537
I tell you guys everything!

11:41.592 --> 11:43.185
We were aiding and abetting a fugitive.

11:43.288 --> 11:44.554
We were just trying to keep you out of it.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.260
You were aiding and abetting Mayfair.

11:47.353 --> 11:50.178
Mayfair! I am happy to
aid and abet Mayfair.

11:50.256 --> 11:51.246
All right, now we know.

11:51.316 --> 11:53.806
Next time, we'll come to
you right away, we promise.

11:54.042 --> 11:55.308
(sighs)

11:56.609 --> 11:58.276
Apology accepted.

11:59.633 --> 12:00.699
All right.

12:00.978 --> 12:02.537
Hit the lights.

12:07.175 --> 12:08.517
Oh, no.

12:08.603 --> 12:09.673
(Reade) Please tell me that's not...

12:09.759 --> 12:11.287
Residual blood.

12:11.871 --> 12:14.338
And... lots of it.

12:15.588 --> 12:17.596
This is very not good.

12:20.183 --> 12:23.639
(creaking, Sarah and Weller grunting)

12:24.593 --> 12:25.864
Okay.

12:34.144 --> 12:35.551
Actually, it wasn't.

12:35.621 --> 12:38.349
In fact, it was a pain in the ass.

12:38.427 --> 12:40.358
I had to call around all day.

12:40.452 --> 12:41.855
Point is, I found it.

12:41.949 --> 12:44.886
50 pounds of lye under "Donato."

12:45.009 --> 12:47.127
You got your Donato ID?

12:47.574 --> 12:48.917
Good.

12:50.031 --> 12:52.236
Give me a call if there's a problem.

13:02.688 --> 13:04.152
(Jane coughing)

13:06.908 --> 13:08.774
(grunting)

13:09.788 --> 13:11.254
(gun clicks)

13:19.606 --> 13:21.538
♪♪

13:24.630 --> 13:25.480
Don't shoot.

13:25.519 --> 13:26.927
What the hell you doing here?

13:26.995 --> 13:28.382
I told you, I had an emergency.

13:28.445 --> 13:30.570
Mayfair. We know, we're taking care of it.

13:30.617 --> 13:32.099
No, not Mayfair... Cade.

13:32.238 --> 13:33.487
Where's Oscar?

13:33.587 --> 13:35.838
I want him to watch you die
for what he did to Marcos.

13:35.912 --> 13:37.078
(gunshot)

13:38.663 --> 13:40.617
Cade is dead.

13:40.709 --> 13:42.581
No... he isn't.

13:42.659 --> 13:44.041
We never found a body.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.136
He was tailing me this morning.

13:45.204 --> 13:46.442
I was able to shake him,

13:46.574 --> 13:49.019
but if he's onto me,
he could be onto Oscar.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.550
There's an apartment building

13:53.604 --> 13:56.088
at 144th Street and Broadway.

13:56.164 --> 13:59.465
Door code,
3-7-1-5.

13:59.558 --> 14:01.186
Go to apartment 312.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.880
We need to get you secured.

14:02.966 --> 14:04.320
And Oscar will meet me there?

14:04.413 --> 14:05.272
Oscar is busy.

14:05.334 --> 14:06.491
Roman will take you upstate.

14:06.562 --> 14:08.104
No, I need Oscar.

14:08.166 --> 14:10.068
- Cade...
- Let us worry about Cade.

14:10.232 --> 14:12.270
Get to the apartment in Harlem.

14:12.379 --> 14:13.935
Roman will take you the rest of the way.

14:14.002 --> 14:15.025
Go!

14:21.613 --> 14:22.813
(grunts)

14:23.140 --> 14:24.605
(shovel scrapes)

14:25.470 --> 14:27.403
(clanking)

14:42.444 --> 14:43.933
(sighs)

14:44.056 --> 14:45.525
It's just a rock.

14:52.693 --> 14:54.753
Wait, wait, wait. 50 pounds of lye?

14:54.814 --> 14:57.268
Yeah. He said it would
be under the name Donato.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.663
Can you cross-check recent
orders around the city?

14:59.772 --> 15:01.247
You know, to, like, see
if anything matches that?

15:01.317 --> 15:03.918
Jane, that much lye,
unless this guy is making

15:03.965 --> 15:05.325
a hell of a lot of homemade soap,

15:05.392 --> 15:07.320
that's as much as you
need to break down a body.

15:07.411 --> 15:10.557
Whose body are they trying
to get rid of and why?

15:10.886 --> 15:12.136
What have you gotten yourself into?

15:12.229 --> 15:13.227
Nothing good.

15:13.361 --> 15:14.751
Okay, but I'm trying to stop it.

15:14.822 --> 15:16.130
- Stop what?
- Ana, please.

15:16.199 --> 15:17.857
Just find me the order.

15:17.943 --> 15:19.210
Let me make this right.

15:19.303 --> 15:21.532
I've already hurt too many people.

15:24.978 --> 15:26.266
I want to run the trace blood samples

15:26.268 --> 15:27.406
against our DNA database,

15:27.494 --> 15:29.365
check to see if it's Mayfair's.

15:29.443 --> 15:32.574
I'm going to create a
virtual machine here first,

15:32.644 --> 15:34.892
because if I run this in the open system,

15:34.953 --> 15:36.658
all sorts of alarm bells are gonna go off.

15:36.701 --> 15:38.053
All that blood.

15:38.147 --> 15:39.438
It can't be hers.

15:39.516 --> 15:41.231
It just can't be.

15:41.309 --> 15:42.773
When Mayfair was
arrested, the U.S. attorney

15:42.820 --> 15:43.901
seized all of her weapons.

15:43.979 --> 15:45.566
But the shell casing we found,

15:45.652 --> 15:47.180
nine millimeter, same caliber as a pistol

15:47.242 --> 15:48.625
registered to her ex-husband.

15:48.672 --> 15:49.870
Guess they didn't catch that one.

15:49.925 --> 15:51.862
I just... I don't understand the why.

15:51.902 --> 15:53.635
Who would go after her like this?

15:53.694 --> 15:55.460
Someone she put away?

15:57.520 --> 15:59.021
I...

15:59.692 --> 16:01.987
A while back, Mayfair had me investigating

16:02.073 --> 16:03.145
Carter's disappearance.

16:03.216 --> 16:06.246
It was a kind of a side
thing, off the books.

16:06.308 --> 16:07.370
Go on.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.322
I grabbed a still from
a traffic cam at the DOT.

16:10.393 --> 16:11.989
There was somebody driving Carter's car

16:12.088 --> 16:13.459
after he was murdered.

16:13.522 --> 16:14.527
It was blurry, but we think it might

16:14.589 --> 16:15.784
have been the guy who killed him.

16:15.831 --> 16:17.710
- What?
- There's more.

16:17.773 --> 16:19.265
I was attacked by a masked man

16:19.351 --> 16:20.755
who threatened to kill Sarah and Sawyer

16:20.833 --> 16:22.105
if I didn't back away.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.333
Mayfair waved me off of it, but...

16:24.412 --> 16:27.097
it's possible she continued
investigating on her own.

16:27.215 --> 16:29.002
And you knew about this, too?

16:29.057 --> 16:31.094
If it makes you feel any better,
he only told me yesterday.

16:31.149 --> 16:33.354
You guys are my family!

16:33.425 --> 16:36.178
If someone is threatening
you, they're threatening me,

16:36.272 --> 16:37.370
but if you keep me in the dark,

16:37.425 --> 16:38.729
I can't help you,

16:38.784 --> 16:41.803
and we're supposed to
help each other, right?

16:41.912 --> 16:43.879
If something would have happened,

16:43.979 --> 16:46.969
and... and if there's something
that I could have done and I...

16:47.024 --> 16:48.076
(sighs)

16:48.178 --> 16:50.305
I can't take that.

16:51.452 --> 16:52.732
Understood.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.224
Truly.

16:55.565 --> 16:57.441
(sighs) Okay.

16:58.511 --> 17:01.178
Let's get back to
committing numerous felonies.

17:03.552 --> 17:05.201
(Ana) Found it.

17:05.367 --> 17:07.601
Rock Chemical Wholesalers.

17:08.134 --> 17:10.339
50 pounds of lye under "Donato."

17:10.417 --> 17:11.661
Still waiting for pickup.

17:11.732 --> 17:13.098
Great.

17:16.733 --> 17:18.477
Pretty sure we're even now.

17:18.615 --> 17:20.138
Yeah.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.513
Thank you.

17:21.627 --> 17:22.858
Good luck.

17:30.108 --> 17:31.249
Kurt.

17:34.832 --> 17:35.970
Kurt.

17:36.497 --> 17:39.231
(panting)

17:41.839 --> 17:43.405
She's not here.

17:44.544 --> 17:46.277
She's not here.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.036
He was just...

17:54.252 --> 17:55.417
Dying.

18:03.632 --> 18:05.956
(electricity crackling)

18:06.540 --> 18:07.840
(cell phone vibrating)

18:13.565 --> 18:15.299
(engine starts)

18:15.735 --> 18:16.999
(phone alert pings)

18:18.952 --> 18:20.565
_

18:23.894 --> 18:25.390
(Weller) <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

18:25.526 --> 18:27.392
<i>My phone's about to die.</i>

18:28.071 --> 18:31.423
<i>I was just checking in
to see how you're doing.</i>

18:31.494 --> 18:33.215
I know yesterday was rough.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.837
And, um...

18:37.361 --> 18:39.702
Look, uh, I... I gotta tell you.

18:39.773 --> 18:41.056
My, uh...

18:41.270 --> 18:44.159
My father died last night.

18:44.641 --> 18:47.229
<i>I wanted to tell you, because, um...</i>

18:47.736 --> 18:49.080
<i>Because...</i>

18:50.237 --> 18:51.463
(chuckling)

18:51.588 --> 18:52.771
I don't know, uh...

18:52.843 --> 18:54.976
No, I do know why.

18:56.584 --> 19:00.770
When things happen to me in my life...

19:02.222 --> 19:04.556
<i>you're the first
person I think about.</i>

19:05.173 --> 19:06.522
<i>And you always have been.</i>

19:07.459 --> 19:08.738
I guess...

19:09.182 --> 19:10.464
(sniffles)

19:10.550 --> 19:12.205
I just wanted to hear your voice.

19:12.291 --> 19:13.430
(chuckling)

19:13.547 --> 19:14.824
Hear you...

19:14.964 --> 19:17.064
tell me everything's gonna be okay.

19:20.167 --> 19:23.282
I'm really glad you're
back in my life, Taylor.

19:23.773 --> 19:25.315
<i>I, um...</i>

19:26.031 --> 19:27.506
<i>(chuckling) just, um...</i>

19:27.623 --> 19:29.735
<i>(clears throat) Just call me back.</i>

19:29.827 --> 19:31.893
<i>(chuckling) Bye.</i>

19:36.592 --> 19:37.891
(phone beeps off)

19:46.564 --> 19:48.031
(truck engine starts)

19:50.640 --> 19:52.084
(Reade) All right, well,
soon as you find out,

19:52.145 --> 19:53.812
just let me know, all right?

19:57.348 --> 19:59.195
I got the tests back.

19:59.697 --> 20:00.774
And...

20:01.097 --> 20:02.694
It's Mayfair's blood.

20:10.338 --> 20:12.158
Weller's phone keeps going
straight to voicemail.

20:12.263 --> 20:15.807
Okay... just because she was
shot doesn't mean she's dead.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.197
That was a lot of blood.

20:17.265 --> 20:18.565
The human body holds a lot.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.440
- We have a lot to lose.
- And there was no body.

20:20.471 --> 20:22.142
They used the bleach to hide what they did.

20:22.205 --> 20:24.426
If there was a body, they
would have hidden that, too.

20:24.512 --> 20:25.483
Okay, even... even if

20:25.553 --> 20:27.707
she was investigating this off the books,

20:27.775 --> 20:30.093
she must have kept some
sort of record somewhere.

20:30.171 --> 20:31.532
Somewhere not here.

20:31.595 --> 20:32.818
Her house.

20:32.881 --> 20:35.119
It's a crime scene. It's sealed.

20:35.205 --> 20:37.794
I have a couple of extra seals in my car.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.363
Let me just say this out loud.

20:39.441 --> 20:40.786
Every step we take from here brings us

20:40.857 --> 20:42.207
further and further across the line.

20:42.285 --> 20:44.789
I'm not just talking about our jobs.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.680
If we get caught breaking
the seal to that house,

20:46.766 --> 20:48.559
they're gonna put us away.

20:49.538 --> 20:51.104
If they catch us.

20:52.569 --> 20:55.800
(Patterson) So... who's driving?

20:56.799 --> 20:58.498
(sighs)

21:11.884 --> 21:13.816
(grunting)

21:15.839 --> 21:17.787
Whoa, easy, we're on the same team.

21:17.856 --> 21:19.448
Not for long.

21:19.534 --> 21:21.083
After the memory wipe,
you're gonna have to win

21:21.161 --> 21:23.473
my trust back, and
that's not gonna be easy.

21:23.535 --> 21:25.619
Chances are, when we meet again,

21:25.681 --> 21:27.306
I will come at you.

21:27.385 --> 21:29.222
You don't think I can win you back?

21:29.317 --> 21:32.627
I don't want your feelings
clouding your judgment, okay?

21:34.242 --> 21:35.503
Okay.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.676
Who's clouded?

21:40.160 --> 21:41.760
(grunting)

21:57.458 --> 21:58.958
(door creaks)

22:06.753 --> 22:09.189
(zap, stun gun crackling)

22:21.015 --> 22:22.502
_

22:30.767 --> 22:32.801
Does Mayfair have a home office?

22:33.533 --> 22:35.500
Uh, upstairs, I think.

22:42.411 --> 22:43.476
Wait!

22:43.708 --> 22:45.684
I've been here before, a bunch of times,

22:45.760 --> 22:47.512
and this painting was different.

22:49.156 --> 22:50.336
(Zapata) Are you sure?

22:50.409 --> 22:52.209
I'm positive.

22:52.590 --> 22:54.299
So she decided to do
some quick redecorating

22:54.372 --> 22:56.271
before going on the run?

22:56.693 --> 22:59.221
Or decides to leave us a sign.

23:05.816 --> 23:06.357
(sighs)

23:06.420 --> 23:08.391
Now, that's what I call a lead.

23:08.635 --> 23:10.439
(Patterson) It's a Biro.

23:10.517 --> 23:11.928
Why did it have to be a Biro?

23:11.997 --> 23:13.125
Is that bad?

23:13.164 --> 23:14.387
No, not bad.

23:14.465 --> 23:16.296
It's the worst.

23:16.330 --> 23:17.952
Biros are perfectly designed.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.186
If I had my tools,

23:19.240 --> 23:21.418
I could maybe bust this
open in a day or two.

23:21.512 --> 23:23.494
- We don't have that kind of time.
- No.

23:23.588 --> 23:24.335
She changed the painting

23:24.405 --> 23:25.837
because she wanted you to see it.

23:25.907 --> 23:27.869
She wants us to get into this thing.

23:27.981 --> 23:29.088
If I were Mayfair, I'd make the code

23:29.189 --> 23:31.054
something we could guess.

23:31.190 --> 23:33.037
Okay, who wants to go first?

23:35.767 --> 23:39.190
Seeing him with Sawyer these last few...

23:39.793 --> 23:41.634
reminded me of what he was like...

23:42.327 --> 23:43.753
before Taylor.

23:46.145 --> 23:48.110
He's so good with him.

23:49.625 --> 23:53.631
Was... so good with him.

23:54.816 --> 23:56.582
I'm glad I saw it.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.075
He really loved you.

23:59.278 --> 24:01.066
He loved you, too.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.536
Mm-mmm.

24:14.167 --> 24:16.113
Yeah. Another family trait.

24:16.199 --> 24:17.746
Drinking the well dry.

24:17.825 --> 24:20.816
Ten bucks says there's a
backup six in the garage.

24:21.186 --> 24:23.560
Better to have it and not
need it than need it...

24:23.638 --> 24:25.630
- And not have it.
- ...and not have it.

24:25.771 --> 24:27.493
Ten bucks?

24:27.555 --> 24:28.129
I'll take that action.

24:28.191 --> 24:29.768
I knew you would.

24:30.180 --> 24:31.213
All right.

24:38.525 --> 24:40.358
(chuckling)

24:58.012 --> 24:59.596
I'll be back in a bit.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.465
What happened?

25:02.104 --> 25:03.315
Kurt!

25:03.565 --> 25:04.831
Kurt!

25:13.603 --> 25:15.492
(Patterson) Could be badge numbers?

25:15.575 --> 25:17.626
(keypad beeping)

25:18.734 --> 25:19.454
(beep)

25:19.532 --> 25:20.916
Uh...

25:20.985 --> 25:24.243
Could be... security PIN.

25:25.780 --> 25:27.436
You know her security PIN?

25:27.522 --> 25:29.211
System administrator, I know all your PINs.

25:29.289 --> 25:30.524
(Reade) Hey, guys.

25:31.069 --> 25:32.772
Come take a look at this.

25:36.334 --> 25:38.398
Do these mean anything to either of you?

25:38.861 --> 25:43.611
A snake, a dog, a pig, and a... mouse.

25:43.666 --> 25:45.274
No, it's a rat.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.602
A mouse, a rat. What is the difference?

25:47.711 --> 25:49.195
They're Chinese Zodiac signs.

25:49.257 --> 25:51.690
Oh, you're totally right!

25:51.807 --> 25:56.080
Weller's the snake, I'm
the dog, Reade's the rat.

25:56.172 --> 25:58.269
And Zapata, you're the pig.

25:59.079 --> 26:00.271
- Shut up.
- I didn't say it.

26:00.334 --> 26:02.854
The Zodiac did. You do like ribs.

26:02.994 --> 26:04.994
Our birth years are the code.

26:07.034 --> 26:08.700
(keypad beeping)

26:12.593 --> 26:14.326
(click, beep)

26:17.601 --> 26:19.401
(squeaking)

26:22.783 --> 26:24.216
(Reade) A USB key.

26:30.550 --> 26:33.634
We went camping, this spot
had all these little plots.

26:33.689 --> 26:35.878
They had cheesy western names like...

26:35.961 --> 26:38.961
Monument Valley, Little Big Horn.

26:43.077 --> 26:44.577
(children squealing)

26:44.696 --> 26:47.475
This is my favorite
place in the whole world.

27:00.924 --> 27:02.857
(faint clatter)

27:10.158 --> 27:11.719
Feels like the end.

27:11.846 --> 27:13.252
I love you.

27:13.782 --> 27:16.800
You know where I come from, how I grew up.

27:16.878 --> 27:20.012
I never thought any of this
would be possible for me.

27:21.194 --> 27:23.812
Shepherd kept telling me
that it would happen one day,

27:23.931 --> 27:25.731
but I didn't believe it.

27:27.301 --> 27:29.143
This isn't the end.

27:30.688 --> 27:32.960
We'll find each other again...

27:33.132 --> 27:34.361
on the other side of all of this.

27:34.440 --> 27:35.859
I promise.

27:39.559 --> 27:42.125
(door creaking)

27:47.253 --> 27:48.646
We're ready.

27:54.897 --> 27:57.053
I'm sorry I failed you.

27:59.101 --> 28:01.068
I don't blame you for hating me.

28:01.502 --> 28:03.875
All I can do is promise that...

28:04.416 --> 28:06.276
I won't make the same mistakes next time.

28:06.354 --> 28:07.792
Next time?

28:08.089 --> 28:09.220
What are you talking about?

28:09.259 --> 28:11.882
The mission can't continue like this.

28:12.056 --> 28:14.492
Our relationship is too compromised.

28:14.578 --> 28:15.819
So...

28:16.149 --> 28:19.220
(sighs) I've decided to start from scratch.

28:22.594 --> 28:23.725
Oscar...

28:23.811 --> 28:25.355
I'm sorry.

28:26.157 --> 28:28.290
I have to wipe your memory again.

28:38.470 --> 28:39.836
(computer beeping)

28:41.025 --> 28:43.539
"To expose the clues, just use the key.

28:43.618 --> 28:45.571
"One query completes the puzzle.

28:45.671 --> 28:48.536
Guess for whom the bell tolls."

28:48.632 --> 28:49.413
What?

28:49.506 --> 28:51.689
- She encrypted the file.
- She knows how to do that?

28:51.775 --> 28:53.111
Yeah, I mean, this is
over-the-counter stuff.

28:53.167 --> 28:55.100
You buy the USB, you
write whatever you want

28:55.190 --> 28:56.750
in the password prompt...
it's not that hard.

28:56.789 --> 28:58.081
It says use the key.

28:58.185 --> 29:00.154
The key is right there, so...

29:00.238 --> 29:01.804
Worth a shot.

29:05.001 --> 29:05.634
(computer voice) <i>Incorrect.</i>

29:05.636 --> 29:07.389
- Oh, come on!
- <i>You have one more attempt</i>

29:07.391 --> 29:09.351
<i>before the drive will self-delete.</i>

29:09.475 --> 29:11.026
Self-delete? Is that
over-the-counter, too?

29:11.053 --> 29:12.596
Unfortunately, yes.

29:12.682 --> 29:14.044
We're sure Mayfair wrote this?

29:14.132 --> 29:16.628
I mean... yes? Right?

29:16.705 --> 29:18.180
And if we guess one more
time and we're wrong,

29:18.182 --> 29:19.321
this thing self-destructs?

29:19.360 --> 29:20.389
Yep.

29:20.503 --> 29:23.612
So we better be really,
really, really sure.

29:28.483 --> 29:31.196
(thunder rumbling)

29:31.354 --> 29:33.590
(boy) Don't worry, I'll keep you safe.

29:33.745 --> 29:35.156
I'll always keep you safe.

29:35.301 --> 29:37.024
I promise.

29:37.072 --> 29:38.538
(thunder crashes)

29:42.637 --> 29:43.903
(grunting)

29:45.878 --> 29:47.570
Please don't do this.

29:47.696 --> 29:50.590
I'm... I'm just starting to
feel like I know who I am again.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.271
You have no idea who you are.

29:52.342 --> 29:54.034
I know that I'm Taylor Shaw.

29:54.115 --> 29:57.274
And I know that this was all my idea.

29:57.388 --> 29:59.648
And I know that... we were in love.

29:59.672 --> 30:02.707
(thunder rumbling)

30:06.712 --> 30:07.979
Yeah.

30:08.756 --> 30:11.681
(sighs) Yeah, we were in love.

30:13.284 --> 30:14.773
And, yes, this was your idea.

30:14.803 --> 30:17.555
But... this is Shepherd's mission.

30:17.657 --> 30:18.929
Always will be.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.765
(grunting)

30:26.534 --> 30:27.759
And, no...

30:27.955 --> 30:30.322
You were never Taylor Shaw.

30:39.258 --> 30:40.992
(thunder crashes)

30:50.199 --> 30:51.984
(screaming)

30:53.536 --> 30:55.103
But my DNA.

30:55.169 --> 30:58.272
Broke into the evidence locker
in Clearfield over a year ago.

30:58.380 --> 31:00.337
We placed Taylor's DNA samples with yours.

31:00.411 --> 31:02.117
But you called me Taylor.

31:02.439 --> 31:04.068
That was your idea.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.302
You figured by the time I revealed myself,

31:06.416 --> 31:09.367
you'd be so deeply
convinced you were Taylor...

31:09.551 --> 31:11.835
Why shift your narrative
more than we had to?

31:11.837 --> 31:13.923
But... why?

31:14.208 --> 31:15.291
Why me?

31:15.385 --> 31:16.904
Why Taylor?

31:17.985 --> 31:19.218
Weller.

31:19.762 --> 31:20.848
What?

31:21.175 --> 31:22.783
Phase One:

31:22.828 --> 31:24.808
We wanted Mayfair out

31:24.869 --> 31:26.972
and didn't want her
replaced by someone worse.

31:27.041 --> 31:29.498
The tattoos would take
down our enemies and...

31:29.585 --> 31:33.054
give Kurt so many wins,
he'd be the clear successor.

31:33.153 --> 31:35.228
And with Taylor Shaw in place
right next to him, he'd...

31:35.284 --> 31:37.133
he'd be someone we could control.

31:37.208 --> 31:40.276
You were never supposed to
have those flashbacks, though.

31:40.448 --> 31:43.252
Marcos was obviously a little
too conservative with the dose.

31:43.301 --> 31:45.790
I won't make that mistake again, either.

31:46.535 --> 31:50.069
(Marcos) Everything that you
have been will cease to exist.

31:50.567 --> 31:53.332
Marcos was the bearded man.

31:53.470 --> 31:54.838
Where's Oscar?

31:54.891 --> 31:57.510
I want him to watch you die
for what he did to Marcos.

31:57.619 --> 31:59.893
Cade didn't kill Marcos
that night, you did.

31:59.895 --> 32:01.394
(gunshots)

32:03.483 --> 32:05.516
And that's why Cade came after you.

32:05.587 --> 32:09.009
Marcos was handling Chao,
and Chao was supposed to die.

32:09.017 --> 32:11.686
When he didn't, Marcos
had to take care of it.

32:11.780 --> 32:14.115
We're trained not to leave a trace.

32:14.230 --> 32:15.707
Find me that doctor.

32:15.806 --> 32:17.976
(Oscar) Shepherd made the
call: Marcos had to go.

32:18.046 --> 32:19.344
And, instead of facing it like a man,

32:19.427 --> 32:23.428
he just panicked and tried
to turn you against us.

32:23.504 --> 32:24.940
Can't trust nobody.

32:24.989 --> 32:25.859
(gunshots, breaking glass)

32:25.861 --> 32:27.931
Marcos was like a brother to Cade.

32:28.096 --> 32:29.790
That's why he wanted you dead.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.750
He wanted me to feel like he felt.

32:31.998 --> 32:33.726
Who is Shepherd?

32:33.898 --> 32:35.498
And what's Orion?

32:35.755 --> 32:38.027
Shepherd is our leader.

32:38.243 --> 32:40.016
Brought you back from the dead.

32:47.045 --> 32:48.085
Shepherd...

32:48.151 --> 32:50.485
Shepherd is the reason we're here.

32:52.269 --> 32:54.142
You're scared of him.

32:54.212 --> 32:55.497
(scoffs)

32:55.605 --> 32:56.820
What?

32:56.933 --> 32:58.530
It doesn't matter.

32:59.710 --> 33:01.938
In a couple hours, you
won't remember any of this.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.496
If removing Mayfair was Phase
One, then what's Phase Two?

33:04.498 --> 33:06.535
This country is on the brink of collapse.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.362
Has been for decades.

33:08.364 --> 33:10.657
This government doesn't
care about the people.

33:10.854 --> 33:12.716
It's too broken, too corrupt.

33:12.755 --> 33:17.036
Phase Two is about burning it to
the ground so we can start again.

33:17.167 --> 33:19.988
Only from the ashes can we rise.

33:25.139 --> 33:27.717
You promised you'd love me no matter what.

33:30.584 --> 33:33.335
I'm really sorry this
is what it's gonna take.

33:34.643 --> 33:36.488
You left a trace, too.

33:37.919 --> 33:39.064
What?

33:39.126 --> 33:40.607
Mayfair.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.168
She found you.

33:42.223 --> 33:44.630
You left a trace, too.

33:45.534 --> 33:48.271
So what's Shepherd gonna
say about that, huh?

33:48.798 --> 33:50.652
Or does he even know?

33:51.454 --> 33:52.853
I love you.

33:54.481 --> 33:56.940
I'll see you in a little while.

33:57.101 --> 33:59.235
On the other side of all this.

34:01.985 --> 34:03.251
Uhh!

34:08.239 --> 34:10.373
(chair splintering and clattering)

34:11.774 --> 34:12.815
I'm bringing you in.

34:12.938 --> 34:15.572
No more secrets and no more lies!

34:15.726 --> 34:16.599
You're under arrest.

34:16.601 --> 34:19.027
You're not FBI. You hate the FBI!

34:19.097 --> 34:21.072
This entire government betrayed you.

34:21.194 --> 34:24.289
I... am bringing you in.

34:31.559 --> 34:32.766
I don't wanna hurt you.

34:32.839 --> 34:34.038
Put it down.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.505
- Doesn't have to be this way.
- Yes, it does.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.906
It's over, Oscar.

34:40.116 --> 34:41.382
Uhh!

34:42.452 --> 34:43.884
(groaning)

34:47.818 --> 34:49.083
Uhh!

34:56.411 --> 34:57.477
Enough!

35:07.309 --> 35:08.342
Uhh!

35:11.700 --> 35:12.999
(sighs)

35:22.400 --> 35:24.300
(loud creaking)

35:24.992 --> 35:26.459
(glass shattering)

35:35.814 --> 35:38.114
(coughing)

35:56.538 --> 35:58.470
(fire crackling)

36:12.025 --> 36:13.858
(metallic clatter)

36:18.471 --> 36:21.005
I want him to watch you die
for what he did to Marcos.

36:22.271 --> 36:23.471
(shaking can)

36:24.156 --> 36:26.623
(spraying)

36:50.632 --> 36:51.996
"To expose the clues, just use the key.

36:52.036 --> 36:53.467
"One query completes the puzzle.

36:53.522 --> 36:55.086
Guess for whom the bell tolls."

36:55.220 --> 36:57.550
Guess for whom the bell tolls.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.882
Does that wording sound
weird to anyone else?

37:01.850 --> 37:03.355
Oh, man.

37:04.229 --> 37:05.537
Oh, man, okay.

37:05.539 --> 37:06.449
(Zapata) What?

37:06.483 --> 37:08.102
All right, it's a pangram.

37:08.749 --> 37:10.911
The reason it sounds weird is
because she uses every letter

37:10.956 --> 37:14.040
of the alphabet except
four in the instructions:

37:14.078 --> 37:16.434
"A," "D," "I," and "V."

37:17.150 --> 37:18.650
"David."

37:19.711 --> 37:21.672
She made this for me.

37:21.727 --> 37:24.781
- So the password is David?
- No.

37:24.836 --> 37:26.648
There's not enough letters.

37:26.842 --> 37:29.931
David is the key to unlocking it.

37:30.051 --> 37:31.939
It's a Vigenère cipher.

37:32.579 --> 37:34.874
Well, what if she used a Vigenère cipher?

37:34.876 --> 37:36.281
Right, just like the
first puzzle we decoded

37:36.283 --> 37:37.992
off Jane's body... it's worth a shot.

37:37.994 --> 37:39.158
Yes, yes. Okay.

37:39.160 --> 37:42.931
A Vigenère cipher is a method
of encrypting alphabetic text

37:43.072 --> 37:45.299
based on the letters of a keyword.

37:45.647 --> 37:49.141
Okay, so "David" is the keyword.

37:49.412 --> 37:54.560
And L-M-N-W-U-U-Y
is...

37:57.792 --> 37:59.497
"I'm sorry."

38:20.013 --> 38:21.213
"Orion."

38:21.321 --> 38:22.592
I don't remember.

38:22.649 --> 38:24.832
- What?
- Orion.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.488
Orion is all that he said?

38:26.528 --> 38:27.962
Yeah, that's right.

38:29.031 --> 38:30.864
(computer beeping)

38:39.862 --> 38:40.882
Whoa.

38:40.944 --> 38:43.158
What the hell did Mayfair get caught up in?

38:43.222 --> 38:44.917
I don't know.

38:45.063 --> 38:46.747
But now we're in it, too.

38:54.070 --> 38:55.749
(Jane) Kurt, it's me.

38:55.827 --> 38:57.291
Please call me back.

38:57.420 --> 38:59.192
It's really important.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.838
(Weller) My phone died.

39:03.558 --> 39:04.726
Kurt?

39:04.879 --> 39:06.111
Jane.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.574
I helped myself.

39:12.048 --> 39:13.514
Hope you don't mind.

39:13.516 --> 39:15.283
I've been trying to call you.

39:16.759 --> 39:18.725
Are you...

39:19.124 --> 39:20.797
What happened?

39:21.524 --> 39:22.575
My father died.

39:22.623 --> 39:24.890
I know, I got your message.

39:25.006 --> 39:26.713
I'm so sorry.

39:27.595 --> 39:28.891
Are you?

39:29.859 --> 39:31.692
Of course I am.

39:33.092 --> 39:35.991
Kurt, s-something happened today and...

39:35.993 --> 39:38.561
It's funny that we still call you Jane.

39:40.089 --> 39:42.521
Isn't it? I get it.

39:43.059 --> 39:47.044
You don't really feel connected to Taylor.

39:48.689 --> 39:53.367
It... was such a long time ago, wasn't it?

39:59.045 --> 40:00.532
What is that?

40:03.417 --> 40:05.050
It was Taylor's.

40:06.895 --> 40:08.995
It was her favorite doll.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.300
She took it everywhere.

40:12.541 --> 40:14.573
She couldn't sleep without it.

40:17.445 --> 40:19.440
So he buried her with it.

40:21.465 --> 40:22.680
What?

40:22.972 --> 40:26.778
He buried her with it... Jane.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.502
My father...

40:28.989 --> 40:32.157
killed Taylor Shaw,

40:32.478 --> 40:34.364
25 years ago.

40:34.503 --> 40:37.788
He told me, right before he died.

40:38.949 --> 40:40.190
So...

40:41.093 --> 40:43.160
if Taylor Shaw is dead...

40:46.895 --> 40:49.366
- (gun cocks)
- Then who the hell are you?

40:49.452 --> 40:50.406
- I don't know.
- Who are you?!

40:50.461 --> 40:52.156
I don't know. I don't know.

40:52.219 --> 40:52.857
But, Kurt, please...

40:52.923 --> 40:55.790
Turn around, get on your knees,

40:55.866 --> 40:57.689
and put your hands on your head.

40:57.736 --> 41:00.768
- I can explain.
- You have the right to remain silent.

41:00.807 --> 41:03.646
- Kurt...
- Anything you say can and will be

41:03.753 --> 41:06.389
- used against you in a court of law.
- No, don't do this.

41:06.473 --> 41:09.097
- You have the right to an attorney.
- You need to listen to me.

41:09.157 --> 41:10.733
You said you remembered!

41:11.707 --> 41:13.337
You remembered what?!

41:14.041 --> 41:15.268
Fishing?

41:15.738 --> 41:17.463
Camping with us?

41:18.203 --> 41:19.669
How?!

41:19.760 --> 41:21.048
You lied to me.

41:21.123 --> 41:23.823
I let my father back into my life...

41:24.143 --> 41:25.615
into my home.

41:27.780 --> 41:29.838
I let him be around Sawyer!

41:33.149 --> 41:35.082
He killed her.

41:35.246 --> 41:37.337
And I let him back in...

41:38.361 --> 41:39.872
because of you.

41:40.603 --> 41:42.051
So turn around...

41:43.019 --> 41:45.186
get on your knees...

41:45.356 --> 41:47.172
and put your hands on your head.

41:47.949 --> 41:49.695
I'm not gonna say it again.

41:50.552 --> 41:51.685
Do it.

41:58.226 --> 42:00.392
Put your hands on your head.

42:07.819 --> 42:09.785
(handcuffs snapping)

42:12.712 --> 42:14.805
- Kurt, please.
- It's over.

42:14.833 --> 42:17.867
Whatever this is, whatever it was about...

42:18.306 --> 42:19.916
it's finished.

42:20.807 --> 42:21.793
But...

42:21.862 --> 42:23.594
Jane Doe...

42:23.937 --> 42:25.736
you're under arrest.
