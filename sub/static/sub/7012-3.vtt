WEBVTT

00:06.110 --> 00:08.950
Wow!
Donna, you look great.

00:09.030 --> 00:10.910
What could it be?

00:10.950 --> 00:13.870
Oh, I know. You lost
80 pounds of ugly fat.

00:13.950 --> 00:16.430
Burn, Eric, burn!

00:18.510 --> 00:20.990
Okay, first of all...

00:21.070 --> 00:25.870
I weigh
a 130... 49... pounds.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.150
Yeah.
You look good too, Eric.

00:28.230 --> 00:31.670
You lost...
your one true love, so...

00:32.750 --> 00:34.590
Looking good.

00:34.670 --> 00:38.150
Eric, I found these records of yours,
and I thought you might want them back.

00:38.230 --> 00:42.790
Ah, the unpleasant exchange of possessions
after the horrific breakup.

00:42.870 --> 00:45.910
Awkward for them,
entertaining for us.

00:45.950 --> 00:49.790
Whoa, whoa. Shut up.
Don Kirshner's starting.

00:49.870 --> 00:53.630
Oh, right. Paul McCartney and Wings
are on tonight.

00:59.870 --> 01:05.470
Okay, so... Okay,
we're all here now.

01:06.590 --> 01:09.950
So... So, Donna,
you're staying?

01:10.030 --> 01:11.950
Okay.

01:12.030 --> 01:15.630
What I meant to say was...

01:15.710 --> 01:17.950
Look, Donna, I don't think
it's cool if you hang out here.

01:20.750 --> 01:23.190
So, what, you're,
like, kicking me out?

01:26.270 --> 01:28.150
Wow.

01:28.190 --> 01:31.190
Okay then. Bye.

01:33.150 --> 01:38.430
Well, if you're kicking her out,
then you're kicking me out.

01:38.510 --> 01:41.110
No, Jackie, no.
Oh, wait. I mean, bye!

02:18.030 --> 02:21.430
So, it's just not fair.
He doesn't, like, get my friends...

02:21.510 --> 02:23.710
'cause he has some stupid,
crappy basement.

02:23.750 --> 02:27.430
Right! You helped make that
basement what it is today.

02:27.510 --> 02:31.390
Right. No one would even
go over there before me.

02:31.430 --> 02:33.350
It smelled like feet.

02:36.710 --> 02:38.590
Donna, you have to fight back.

02:38.630 --> 02:40.550
Okay, when a couple splits up...

02:40.630 --> 02:43.830
the woman deserves her fair share
of the life she helped build.

02:46.070 --> 02:49.150
- How much is that?
- All of it!

02:50.670 --> 02:52.550
Donna, it's the law.

02:52.590 --> 02:55.910
You know, normally, that statement
would really offend me.

02:55.990 --> 03:00.190
But now that I'm single and pissed,
you're making a lot of sense.

03:02.150 --> 03:06.590
<i>And then she just comes down</i>
<i>in the basement like it's no big deal.</i>

03:06.630 --> 03:11.550
After what happened? And she's just gonna act
like everything's cool and everything's fine?

03:11.630 --> 03:15.710
<i>You don't love me,</i>
<i>you don't get my couch... or my friends.</i>

03:15.750 --> 03:18.230
<i>I'm a package deal, baby!</i>

03:18.310 --> 03:22.190
<i>So, I just told her, "Fire up those walking</i>
<i>sticks, Big Red, because this ain't happening.</i>

03:22.270 --> 03:24.270
<i>I'm not having it."</i>

03:27.750 --> 03:32.870
Hey, Forman, we were all there,
and that ain't how it happened.

03:33.950 --> 03:36.030
You wanna talk about it
some more?

03:39.030 --> 03:41.670
Mmm, no.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.910
- Hello, Kitty.
- Oh, Pastor Dave!

03:47.990 --> 03:51.950
What a nice surprise.
How's... God?

03:52.030 --> 03:54.870
Fine, thank you.

03:56.350 --> 04:00.110
So, I was wondering if,
uh, Red was home.

04:00.190 --> 04:02.750
Oh, no.
What did he do?

04:02.790 --> 04:04.670
No. No, no, nothing.
I just thought...

04:04.710 --> 04:09.950
he might like to, uh...
I don't know... goof off?

04:10.990 --> 04:13.150
You want to
spend time with Red.

04:13.230 --> 04:16.149
- Unless it's a bad time.
- Oh, no, no, no. This is a great time.

04:16.230 --> 04:18.750
Oh, my God!
Red has a visitor!

04:18.829 --> 04:22.630
Red, Pastor Dave's here!
For you! Hurry!

04:22.710 --> 04:26.310
Oh, yeah. I ran into him
in the hardware store.

04:26.390 --> 04:31.310
You know, he was gonna try to paint
his garage without priming.

04:31.390 --> 04:33.430
That crazy bastard.

04:37.350 --> 04:40.910
Oh, my.
Red has a friend.

04:47.910 --> 04:49.830
Psst!

04:52.390 --> 04:54.750
What are you guys doing today?

04:56.790 --> 04:59.590
We're going to the basement.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.470
Hmm. Sounds fun.

05:06.550 --> 05:08.470
But you know what sounds
like even more fun?

05:08.550 --> 05:11.230
Oh! Playing with a bunch
of monkeys?

05:16.150 --> 05:19.270
Well, yeah.

05:19.350 --> 05:22.870
But we got cable TV
at my house...

05:22.950 --> 05:26.910
which we all know has the potential
for flashes of brief nudity.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.190
Nudity!

05:36.110 --> 05:39.550
Cable? Oh, you are so gonna
win this breakup!

05:43.110 --> 05:45.150
Now, wait just a minute.

05:45.230 --> 05:47.470
Eric is our friend,
our brother.

05:47.550 --> 05:51.270
We cannot just abandon him for nude boobs.

05:54.830 --> 05:59.270
Good point, Fez. This nudity you speak of,
are we talking full frontal?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.550
- Does it matter?
- No. Let's go.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.590
So, you have no idea
where everyone is?

06:22.390 --> 06:24.350
Everyone who?

06:25.470 --> 06:28.910
Hey, you got any Popsicles?
Donna's all out.

06:31.830 --> 06:35.150
Oh, so that's how it is?
Everyone's over at Donna's?

06:35.230 --> 06:37.310
Eric, man, I'm sorry.

06:37.350 --> 06:40.870
And I know that we've been friends
for, like, a really long time...

06:40.950 --> 06:45.310
but, uh, we were watching
<i>Barbarella</i> on cable.

06:45.390 --> 06:50.150
Man, and I not only saw boobs,
but I saw boobs in space!

06:50.190 --> 06:52.110
Yeah, space boobs, Eric!

06:53.670 --> 06:55.870
There's no gravity!

07:04.870 --> 07:08.190
She got cable?
That sneaky little wench.

07:09.550 --> 07:12.310
No, no. And corn dogs.

07:14.750 --> 07:18.150
Oh, dogs wrapped in corn.

07:21.030 --> 07:23.190
Oh, sweet meat on a stick.

07:29.670 --> 07:32.670
- Just go.
- Thank you.

07:45.390 --> 07:49.670
"At Dave's.
Back around 5:00. Red."

07:49.750 --> 07:51.590
Oh!

07:59.070 --> 08:04.790
I hadn't realized before,
but the primer is like your emotions.

08:04.870 --> 08:07.230
It's what's underneath
the surface.

08:07.270 --> 08:10.470
And the rust
is like your anger.

08:10.550 --> 08:12.590
Boy...

08:12.670 --> 08:16.710
having a male companion
to talk to is changing my life.

08:25.190 --> 08:29.790
I wish I could tell Kitty
exactly how I feel about her...

08:29.870 --> 08:31.790
but I just
can't find the words.

08:31.870 --> 08:34.710
I'll help you.
We'll find the words together.

08:39.390 --> 08:41.309
Oh, sure...

08:41.350 --> 08:46.910
sometimes I feel like crying,
but I just can't.

08:46.950 --> 08:49.310
You can with me.

08:56.390 --> 08:58.830
- Hey.
- Oh, hello.

08:58.910 --> 09:01.470
So, how was your day?
What did you and your new friend do?

09:02.510 --> 09:04.830
Well...

09:22.430 --> 09:25.310
- So, that's all you did?
- Yep.

09:25.350 --> 09:28.190
Well, you didn't talk
about anything?

09:28.230 --> 09:30.390
Nope.

09:32.870 --> 09:36.910
- Do you hate him?
- Kitty, don't start.

09:36.990 --> 09:40.710
No, no, no. All I'm saying is,
people with friends live longer.

09:40.790 --> 09:43.270
And you are not good
at keeping friends.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.750
Bob's scared of you,
and Earl isn't speaking to you.

09:45.830 --> 09:48.670
- What about Frank?
- Frank's dead.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.670
Exactly.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.990
It is time to replace
your dead friend Frank.

09:53.030 --> 09:55.390
I win.

10:00.390 --> 10:02.310
Oh, look,
there's a boob!

10:06.270 --> 10:08.430
There's two.

10:08.510 --> 10:10.790
Oh, wait. Four.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.950
It's the mother lode.

10:18.070 --> 10:20.750
Oh, man. Guy butt. Look away.

10:22.350 --> 10:24.350
I feel kinda bad.

10:24.430 --> 10:27.950
Hon, it's just guy butt.
It won't hurt you.

10:28.910 --> 10:30.870
No! About Eric.

10:30.950 --> 10:33.470
I mean, he was totally in the right
to kick Donna out.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.790
Oh, he was not right.

10:37.350 --> 10:39.790
Now, you agree with me!

10:39.870 --> 10:41.630
No.

10:41.710 --> 10:45.630
Agree with me.

10:45.710 --> 10:48.390
No! Donna broke his heart,
and now she should have to pay.

10:49.470 --> 10:52.550
- Chex Mix?
- Oh, thank you, Donna.

10:55.990 --> 10:57.910
Oh, we are so not talking.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.390
- All right, Jack...
- I said, not talking!

11:00.470 --> 11:03.150
- Well done.
- All right, Fez. The...

11:03.230 --> 11:05.150
I said, well done!

11:08.910 --> 11:11.190
Oh, there are
all my friends.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.150
Hey, Donna,
I found these socks of yours...

11:13.230 --> 11:15.350
so I thought I'd just, you know,
run 'em right over.

11:28.830 --> 11:30.670
Eric, you can't hang out here.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.590
It's really uncomfortable, so...

11:32.670 --> 11:34.590
Uncomfortable?

11:37.070 --> 11:38.950
Who's uncomfortable?

11:43.110 --> 11:45.710
Oh, fine.

11:47.870 --> 11:50.990
Look, man, I'd go with you,
but, you know, it's cable.

11:51.070 --> 11:52.910
Whatever.

11:52.990 --> 11:55.350
Hey, want me to come by later
and tell you about the boobs?

11:55.470 --> 11:58.110
No! Yeah.

12:05.670 --> 12:08.030
It's Dave for you.

12:13.470 --> 12:15.870
Yeah?

12:15.950 --> 12:18.630
Fine. Right.

12:18.670 --> 12:21.190
Okay.

12:28.470 --> 12:31.590
You do not grunt
to a friend.

12:31.670 --> 12:35.950
Friends don't grunt.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.910
Okay, so I was over
at the Pinciottis'...

12:40.950 --> 12:43.310
crouched behind the hedge next to the house,
and I distinctly heard laughter.

12:43.390 --> 12:46.550
Laughter!
Well, I will tell you what.

12:46.630 --> 12:49.670
I am not going down without a fight.
No, sirree, Bob.

12:53.590 --> 12:56.430
Bob!

12:56.470 --> 12:58.670
The kids really
like my jokes?

12:58.750 --> 13:01.110
Oh.

13:04.590 --> 13:07.190
Mr. Pinciotti, if you only knew
the number of times...

13:07.270 --> 13:10.110
Donna's shared one of
your doozies with the gang.

13:11.950 --> 13:14.230
Lordy, how we laugh and laugh.

13:15.790 --> 13:17.670
And laugh.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.310
Right. I'm goin'.

13:20.390 --> 13:22.230
Okay.

13:23.390 --> 13:25.710
But the tennis pro says...

13:28.870 --> 13:32.550
"We don't serve
those kind of balls."

14:01.030 --> 14:04.430
Welcome home, friends.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.430
Who wants Popsicles?

14:08.030 --> 14:10.030
Hey, I don't feel good
about this.

14:10.110 --> 14:14.670
Well, would you rather be at Donna's singing
backup to "Cha Cha Di Amore"?

14:16.790 --> 14:20.750
- Oh. Well, will you look who's here.
- That was a dirty trick, Forman.

14:20.830 --> 14:23.710
Well, I'd love to stay and talk about it,
but we're on our way to the movies.

14:23.790 --> 14:25.390
Yeah.

14:25.470 --> 14:27.950
Fine. Then I'm taking them
bowling Saturday.

14:28.030 --> 14:30.070
Yeah!

14:31.310 --> 14:33.190
Fine.

14:33.270 --> 14:35.470
Ooh, what a fun weekend.

14:41.390 --> 14:45.950
Hey, look, you guys can't buy our loyalty
with these little field trips.

14:46.030 --> 14:49.150
You're gonna have to start buying us
some stuff we can take home.

14:50.830 --> 14:55.270
Well, look, I think it's stupid
to have to go day by day.

14:55.310 --> 14:58.350
Why doesn't Donna
just get us on the weekends?

14:58.430 --> 15:02.470
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not fair...

15:02.550 --> 15:04.670
because then Eric gets
all the weekday headaches...

15:04.750 --> 15:06.950
and Donna gets
all the fun time.

15:09.830 --> 15:12.630
Fine. Then we'll make
a schedule. Eric?

15:12.710 --> 15:14.390
Fine. Have a seat.

15:17.510 --> 15:19.390
Make sure to schedule time
with Bob.

15:19.470 --> 15:21.390
He takes me
to Chuckle Town.

15:28.190 --> 15:30.830
So, um, what are you
and Dave gonna do today?

15:30.910 --> 15:35.310
Go out to the garage and talk
friend to friend? That would be nice.

15:37.230 --> 15:42.350
No. We're gonna turn on the fight
and watch two nice men...

15:42.430 --> 15:45.670
beat the living hell
out of each other.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.590
That's nice.

15:47.630 --> 15:50.790
Oh. Oh.

15:52.630 --> 15:55.270
Oh, come on in,
Pastor Dave.

15:55.310 --> 15:58.470
Red and I are just so happy
that you are here.

15:58.510 --> 16:02.470
- Especially Red.
- Kitty.

16:02.510 --> 16:07.390
I want you to know that it is so nice
for Red to finally have a boyfriend.

16:07.470 --> 16:09.510
For God sakes, Kitty!

16:10.670 --> 16:13.230
Oh, lighten up, silly.
"Man friend." Whatever.

16:13.310 --> 16:15.590
Someone to talk to,
share their feelings with.

16:15.630 --> 16:19.670
Anyway, you are an important
part of Red's life.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.470
Oh.

16:21.550 --> 16:24.790
- Well...
- Wait. No. Don't listen to her.

16:24.870 --> 16:27.390
I don't really want to share
my feelings with you.

16:27.470 --> 16:30.990
Hell, I don't even think
I have feelings.

16:31.070 --> 16:35.430
Now, let's just watch these two guys
beat the crap out of each other.

16:35.470 --> 16:37.390
Sold!

16:38.870 --> 16:41.150
Well, I don't care
what you say.

16:41.230 --> 16:43.630
You're boyfriends,
and that's nice.

16:47.270 --> 16:51.510
You know, Red, I am so glad
that I have someone to share with...

16:51.590 --> 16:53.590
because I woke up this morning
feeling upset.

16:55.110 --> 16:57.630
Ha-ha! I gotcha!

16:57.710 --> 17:01.270
Good one, Dave.
Good one!

17:01.350 --> 17:03.230
Don't ever do that again.

17:09.390 --> 17:11.270
I'm just saying, Forman...

17:13.670 --> 17:16.950
you really didn't deliver
on the afternoon like I was hoping.

17:17.030 --> 17:19.869
Dude, I took you everywhere.

17:19.950 --> 17:22.910
I bought everything.
It was a great day.

17:22.990 --> 17:27.030
I don't know, man. I mean, I asked you for
a six-pack. You brought me out a tall boy.

17:28.710 --> 17:30.590
I'm just saying.

17:30.670 --> 17:34.790
Fine. Whatever.
They're all yours.

17:34.830 --> 17:36.950
Twenty minutes late.

17:39.070 --> 17:41.870
Sorry. We had to stop
so Fez could pee.

17:43.110 --> 17:45.710
Yes, it was my fault.
Please do not fight.

17:50.630 --> 17:55.870
Eric, listen, travel time should come out
of your time, not mine.

17:59.510 --> 18:01.990
What's on Fez's face?

18:02.030 --> 18:04.990
Nothing. Nothing.

18:05.070 --> 18:08.790
Is that ice cream?
Now he won't want dinner!

18:11.430 --> 18:13.310
I am sorry I ate
ice cream, Donna.

18:13.390 --> 18:15.950
- Do not be mad.
- Oh.

18:16.030 --> 18:19.590
Fez, I'm mad at Eric,
not at you.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.350
This is not about you.

18:26.390 --> 18:30.470
Listen, I'm not about to limit
our good time to help with yours.

18:30.550 --> 18:33.150
- Why would you do anything to help me?
- Oh, you listen, missy.

18:33.230 --> 18:36.550
- I'm not gonna...
- Stop it! Stop it!

18:40.030 --> 18:42.310
You are tearing us apart!

18:43.870 --> 18:46.310
I hope you're happy.
Now you've upset Fez.

18:48.070 --> 18:51.150
Yeah, and your fighting is
making me and Jackie fight...

18:51.230 --> 18:53.550
and that interferes
with us doing it.

18:55.270 --> 18:57.710
And that ain't good.

18:57.790 --> 19:01.870
So, until you guys fix this, we're not
hanging out with either one of you. Let's go.

19:07.470 --> 19:09.390
Hyde, I'm sticky.

19:11.950 --> 19:15.110
Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.750
And I'm sleepy.

19:19.830 --> 19:22.190
I know.
You had a big day!

19:29.070 --> 19:31.390
This is your fault.
None of this would have happened...

19:31.470 --> 19:34.070
if you hadn't been such a jerk
and kicked me out of the basement.

19:34.150 --> 19:36.470
Well, you came in
and you were just so...

19:36.550 --> 19:39.390
"Oh, we broke up, and I don't care,
and, hey, let's just watch TV."

19:41.830 --> 19:44.630
Eric, I was faking it.

19:44.710 --> 19:48.030
I'm miserable and uncomfortable,
and this whole thing sucks.

19:49.070 --> 19:50.990
You're miserable?

19:52.790 --> 19:54.790
Well, that's great!

19:56.270 --> 19:58.950
I mean, I'm miserable too.

20:03.630 --> 20:06.950
Okay, so, how about this?

20:06.990 --> 20:11.590
We just hang out together
and pretend everything's fine...

20:11.670 --> 20:14.230
for, you know...
for the sake of our friends.

20:17.110 --> 20:19.030
I can do that.

20:19.110 --> 20:21.030
Okay.

20:21.110 --> 20:23.550
But, you know,

20:23.630 --> 20:27.030
You have to stop trying to
look so hot when you come over.

20:27.110 --> 20:29.750
I have not been doing that.

20:29.830 --> 20:32.550
Red lipstick, no bra?

20:36.430 --> 20:38.310
Okay, yeah, I did that.

20:40.870 --> 20:43.550
And, Fez,
you sit on the dryer.

20:43.590 --> 20:46.910
Okay. This new seating arrangement
should really work.

20:49.110 --> 20:51.510
There you kids are.

20:51.590 --> 20:56.110
I think I finally remembered the punch line
to the Italian midget joke.

20:56.190 --> 20:58.830
- My mom made fish.
- I gotta register for the draft.

20:58.910 --> 21:00.750
- Me too.
- I gotta go count my G.I. Joes.

21:00.830 --> 21:03.590
I'll be in the oven.

21:06.910 --> 21:09.550
Wow. Tough room.

21:10.305 --> 21:16.531
