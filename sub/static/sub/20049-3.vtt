You ’14? heard of

00:35.070 --> 00:37.777
That if a butterﬂy ﬂaps its WIngs

00:37.870 --> 00:39.189
in just the n'ght place. . .

00:41.830 --> 00:44.617
it can cause a hurricane

[woman] Hold on.

00:58.470 --> 00:59.801
Is Justin here?

00:59.890 --> 01:02.381
Haven't seen him for days.
I thought he was with you.

01:02.470 --> 01:04.222
He told me he was going home last night.

01:04.810 --> 01:06.095
Yeah, well, he didn't.

01:06.190 --> 01:08.351

-Justin's girlfriend.

01:09.860 --> 01:11.100
[sighs]

01:11.820 --> 01:12.775
Girlfriend, huh?

01:13.650 --> 01:16.608
Tell that little shit that his mother
is worried sick, all right?

01:17.450 --> 01:19.907
Yeah. She looks it.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.447
Tell him call her today
or don't bother coming home.

It’s chaos theory.

01:28.750 --> 01:32.459
But see, chaos theory
isn ’t exact/y about chaos.

01:33.340 --> 01:37.504
It’s about how a tiny change
in a big system can affect eve/yth/ng.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.000

01:39.090 --> 01:40.967

-Just having some fun.

Justy, you know you're welcome here
all the damn time, buddy,

01:55.820 --> 01:57.697
but I thought you were
going home last night.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.566
Yeah, that guy Seth is back.

01:59.660 --> 02:01.901
-Meth Seth?
-Yeth.

02:01.990 --> 02:03.116
[both laugh]

02:04.120 --> 02:07.032
And that's all, right? Just Meth Seth?

02:07.620 --> 02:09.167
Yeah, just that asshole.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.586
I can't deal with him, you know that.

02:11.670 --> 02:13.956
'Cause your girlfriend's texting me now.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.883
Brother, you know that Seth or whatever,

02:19.970 --> 02:22.347
I got your back, always.

02:22.970 --> 02:23.800
Yeah, I know.

Whatever you did,
if you even fucking did anything,

02:27.100 --> 02:28.306
we can take care of it.

02:29.770 --> 02:31.180
I mean anything.

02:31.270 --> 02:32.305
You know my one rule.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.219
Keep you clean.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.356
Keep me clean. All right.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.658
And Jessica, take care of her, all right?

02:40.280 --> 02:41.269
She's your girl.

-Yeah.

Chaos theory.
Sounds dramatic, but it’s not.

03:00.630 --> 03:01.790
Ask a mathematician.

03:02.510 --> 03:05.308

Do you want to help? Put up posters.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.660
No, no thanks, Marcus.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.081
Come on, school spirit.

03:36.670 --> 03:38.752
All right? Making a contribution.

03:38.840 --> 03:39.750
Giving back.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.176
Giving back to who, exactly?

[band warming up]

03:44.970 --> 03:46.756
Why are they playing in the courtyard?

03:46.850 --> 03:49.466
Uh, yeah. They asked student council.
Thought it was a great idea.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.379
Got a concert tonight.

Little did I know
you would F. my t. forever.

04:08.580 --> 04:10.901
Little did I know
you would be my hurricane.

-Hey, Alex.
-Hey.

04:12.410 --> 04:14.617
-You okay?
-Yeah, I just-- I overslept.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.996
Mr. McLean wants us to start
with "Take Five."

04:17.090 --> 04:19.797
-He thinks that'll raise spirits.
-Love me some Brubeck.

04:20.380 --> 04:24.214
Though of course it was written
by Paul Desmond, but whatever.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.098
If they want a spirit-raiser,
how about "Gloomy Sunday"?

04:27.930 --> 04:30.842
Are you serious?
That song's totally depressing.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.681
Or it's beautiful, if you have taste.

04:33.770 --> 04:35.226
Or if you're suicidal.

04:41.740 --> 04:42.638
Way to go, Troy.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.276
Aw, shit.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.612
Was he friends with Hannah Baker?
I didn't know.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.691
[Hannah]
Maybe you think I’m being s/iiy.

04:49.740 --> 04:52.994
I’m some stupid girl who gets
all worked up over a little thing.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.707
But little things matter.

04:56.920 --> 05:00.492
For instance, you never told me
when you stated dating Jessica.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.922
But I remember just how it ended

05:05.840 --> 05:07.330
-With your list.
-[sighs]

05:10.180 --> 05:11.886
Is "Gloomy Sunday" really a song?

05:13.140 --> 05:15.938
Yeah. Google "Hungarian Suicide Song."

05:16.940 --> 05:18.225
I'll take your word for it.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.219
Alex.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.309
Can we, um...

05:27.610 --> 05:28.520
talk about this?

05:31.740 --> 05:33.367
What is there to talk about?

05:33.450 --> 05:35.702
-Is Hannah telling the truth?
-What do you think?

05:36.290 --> 05:38.030
Did you do what she said you did?

05:40.590 --> 05:44.003
Alex. "Take the 'A' Train,"
with your solo.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.046
All right, well,

05:46.130 --> 05:49.179
I guess if I'm gonna be happy,
may as well do it with the Duke.

[Hannah]
Alex, we hadn ’t talked
since you two got together.

05:57.190 --> 06:02.105
And then it seemed l/ke maybe
you might not be together anymore.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.230
Hey, Jess.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.150
Hey.

06:09.660 --> 06:10.558
Mrs. Antilly?

06:11.240 --> 06:12.070
Yeah.

06:13.080 --> 06:13.978
Everything okay?

06:14.790 --> 06:15.996
What, like in the world?

06:16.080 --> 06:17.490
Or with you.

06:18.250 --> 06:19.160
Yeah.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.992
You could drop by our office later,
if you want to make a full report.

06:23.090 --> 06:24.375
Our office?

06:24.460 --> 06:25.620
Monet's.

06:25.710 --> 06:27.666
Oh. Yeah, right.

06:28.090 --> 06:29.375
I forgot about that.

06:30.010 --> 06:31.170
The office thing.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.887
Yeah. It's been a while.

06:32.970 --> 06:35.097
Yeah, there's just so much going on.

06:42.310 --> 06:45.359
Hey, how about a Monet's reunion today?

06:46.440 --> 06:50.149
You have a few drink selections left
on your great menu journey.

06:50.490 --> 06:51.650
YOU were SO committed once.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.367
Yeah, commitment's hard for Alex.

06:54.450 --> 06:56.998
At least I have the ability
to try something new in life.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.900
[Hannah]
Is that why you did it; Alex?

07:01.120 --> 07:01.996
Mrs. Baker.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.877
Hi. I wasn't expecting you.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.377
Olivia. Please.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.041
Yeah. Well, come on in.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.387
Thank you for making the time.

07:13.470 --> 07:14.789
I-I, uh...

07:15.510 --> 07:16.716
I know how busy you are.

07:16.810 --> 07:18.095
No, not at all.

07:18.180 --> 07:19.886
-[shuts door]
-What can I do for you?

07:23.690 --> 07:25.260
Well, I was, um,

07:25.360 --> 07:29.854
I'm wondering if you could tell me
something about Hannah's school life.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.198
I mean, was she unhappy here?

07:33.280 --> 07:34.110
Well...

07:34.700 --> 07:36.986
I don't think I can answer that.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.537
I know you can't possibly
know every student,

07:39.620 --> 07:43.875
but my husband and I,
we're still trying to understand.

07:46.670 --> 07:48.956
At home, Hannah was--
Well, I mean...

07:49.710 --> 07:52.213
sometimes she would run around the house

07:52.300 --> 07:55.258
singing show tunes in funny voices
and showering us with hugs,

07:55.350 --> 07:57.056
and other times...

07:58.140 --> 08:02.634
she was quiet and moody and it'd
be hard to get a word out of her.

08:02.730 --> 08:03.549
Sure.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.016
But nothing she did told us she was...

08:08.070 --> 08:08.889
capable of--

08:08.980 --> 08:12.984
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to stop you right there, Mrs. Baker.

08:13.070 --> 08:14.901
I'm terribly sorry for your loss,

08:14.990 --> 08:18.733
and I wish I could offer you
what you need,

08:18.830 --> 08:20.570
but I just can't.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.668
Now that lavwers are involved.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.160
What are you saying?

08:27.250 --> 08:29.832
What I'm saying is that,
in light of your lawsuit,

08:29.920 --> 08:33.219
I shouldn't even be talking to you.

08:33.930 --> 08:34.828
I see.

08:36.470 --> 08:37.676
So then why are you?

08:37.760 --> 08:40.593
You and your husband are members
of our school community,

08:40.680 --> 08:44.093
and we want nothing more
than to support you during this time.

08:47.310 --> 08:49.858
I can only imagine your grief.

08:50.940 --> 08:54.239
You can't imagine the first thing
about my life right now.

I'm going to take pictures.

10:07.890 --> 10:09.300
I'm Courtney Crimsen.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.026
I'm so sorry for your loss.

10:15.860 --> 10:16.895
I hope you like it.

10:17.740 --> 10:18.809
People keep adding to it.

10:19.450 --> 10:22.442
Um, every day there's another card
or more flowers.

10:23.450 --> 10:26.999
All these people were Hannah's friends?

10:27.080 --> 10:27.899
Mm-hmm.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.207
She had so many friends and...

10:31.460 --> 10:33.337
we all miss her so much.

10:34.090 --> 10:37.162
Anyone who knew Hannah
would know that she hated roses.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.961
She thought they were a clich.

10:59.070 --> 11:00.059
Hey, Hannah.

11:01.570 --> 11:02.650
-Hey.
-Morning, Helmet.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.115
Urgent question.

11:05.660 --> 11:08.242
Have you noticed anything weird
about Alex lately?

11:09.160 --> 11:12.994
Um... Well, his hair's weird,
but that's not new.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.373
I didn't say it wasn't awesome,
it's just, like, distinctive.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.007
And he's an amazing dresser.

11:20.090 --> 11:21.967
I mean, you could take a few lessons.

11:22.050 --> 11:23.039
I totally could.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.426
And I'm glad we got around to my failings

11:25.510 --> 11:27.558
because I was wondering
when we would get to that.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.015
Are you working tonight?

11:30.480 --> 11:31.970
Yeah, we're both on at six.

11:32.060 --> 11:33.971
I mean, I think. On the schedule.

11:35.690 --> 11:38.352
So, speaking of tonight,
I don't know if you know this,

11:38.440 --> 11:41.102
but there's a penumbral
lunar eclipse at 11:49.

11:41.950 --> 11:42.769
A what?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.860
The Earth's shadow is the penumbra.

11:45.950 --> 11:47.861
Tonight, the moon
is gonna pass through it.

11:47.950 --> 11:51.033
Last show is at nine,
and if we clean fast, and we probably can,

11:51.120 --> 11:54.533
because no kids are coming to that
English movie because it's boring,

11:54.630 --> 11:59.624
we could get out in time,
and I could maybe point it out to you.

12:00.380 --> 12:01.210
If you want.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.460
You want to show me the moon?

12:05.800 --> 12:08.257
There would be a shadow.
Not like a full eclipse.

12:08.350 --> 12:10.170
You wouldn't exactly see the...

12:10.770 --> 12:11.589
But, yeah.

12:12.310 --> 12:13.470
[chuckles]

12:13.560 --> 12:16.518
You should, like, patent yourself.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.891
And, yes, I will look
at the moon with you.

12:21.990 --> 12:23.275
I might even howl.

12:23.990 --> 12:25.400
Cool. Cool.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.906
So, yeah, I'll see you tonight.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.148
[locker doom slams]

12:40.800 --> 12:42.620
Aanays, is Justin still missing?

12:43.590 --> 12:46.297
He's not missing.
I know exactly where he is.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.766
[sighs] So he's at Bryce's.

12:51.850 --> 12:52.885
Maybe you should go.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.971
I shouldn't have to go. He should be here.

12:55.060 --> 12:58.223
Then go get him. Drag him back
to school by his perfect hair.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.720
Right.

12:59.820 --> 13:00.889
You know what?

13:00.980 --> 13:04.029
Tell him that you entered him
into that costume contest.

13:04.110 --> 13:05.520
Two hundred bucks.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.113
Yeah, maybe he could dress up
as my actual boyfriend.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.363
[Mr. Porter]
I spoke to Justin,
but now I need to speak to Alex Standa/l.

13:12.450 --> 13:16.409
He dated Jessica Davis,
who I spoke to yesterday.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.661
Justin Foley the day before.

13:19.130 --> 13:23.203
There was this rumor that Justin
and Hannah had sex in a park.

13:24.970 --> 13:28.588
Justin said it was all a big joke,
and Hannah blew it out of proportion.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.090
Did you follow it up?

13:30.180 --> 13:32.307
Justin's been absent
for the past two days.

13:33.810 --> 13:35.346
[principal]
Did you call home?

13:35.440 --> 13:36.976
[Mr. Porter]
No answer.

13:37.060 --> 13:38.641
I spoke with Coach Patrick

13:39.770 --> 13:45.231
Apparently, it’s just his mom
and a series of stepdads and boyfriends.

13:46.860 --> 13:50.239
Coach thinks there may have been abuse
at some point in the past.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.480
-[,0r/'nC/;0a/]
At home?
-[Mr. Porter]
Yes.

14:26.190 --> 14:27.646
[doorbell rings]

14:30.030 --> 14:31.861
[doorbell continues]

14:46.380 --> 14:47.210
Hey.

14:53.390 --> 14:54.630
[sobs]

15:01.100 --> 15:02.180
[principal]
And Jessica Davis?

15:02.270 --> 15:06.274
As I understand it,
she was Hannah's first friend here.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.851
Uh, now she's Justin's girlfriend.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.737
So, I imagine she protected him.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.731
Could be, or she doesn't know anything.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.821
She didn't say much.

15:15.910 --> 15:19.152
This lawsuit could cost the district
tens of thousands,

15:19.250 --> 15:21.161
hundreds, and that's if we win.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.911
We're already getting calls
from the media.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.627
Yeah. I understand.

15:24.710 --> 15:27.838
And she never came to you, for help?

15:28.550 --> 15:31.371
We had a meeting last year
about colleges.

15:31.470 --> 15:34.542
All the time and resources
we've dedicated to her now.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.058
If we'd known she needed help before...

16:10.920 --> 16:12.626
[Coach Patrick]
All right; young people.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.836
-Let the learning commence.
-[TV music]

16:14.930 --> 16:15.919
We've got a film today,

16:16.010 --> 16:18.638
continuing on our World War II unit.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.803
It's full of facts, even though
technically it's fiction.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.103
No talking, no texting. [snorts]

16:26.480 --> 16:27.310
No sleeping.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.318
Ironic, as he will sleep
through the whole thing.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.608
Right? Remember when he showed
Gladiator
for Roman history?

16:34.700 --> 16:35.519
Oh, yeah.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.361
Seriously, John Wayne?

16:39.450 --> 16:40.656
Shh.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.492
-You're gonna disturb his nap.
-[chuckles]

16:50.090 --> 16:51.330
Cover me if he wakes up.

16:51.420 --> 16:52.250
Okay.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.635
[coughs]

17:14.610 --> 17:19.616
[Hannah]
Maybe, A/eX...
you were just being a dick.

17:22.410 --> 17:24.458
-Alex--
-Go back to class, Clay.

17:24.540 --> 17:25.495
What are you doing?

17:25.580 --> 17:26.786
I'm cleaning up.

17:26.870 --> 17:29.532
What, they think these are gonna
save someone's life?

17:29.630 --> 17:31.370
"Suicide's not an option"?

17:31.460 --> 17:34.258
Yeah, you know what?
Clearly it is an option, you know?

17:34.340 --> 17:37.218
Why don't they put up a poster
that says "Don't be a dick"?

17:37.300 --> 17:39.211
Why don't we put up that poster?

17:39.300 --> 17:42.269
Yeah, that would be cool with me.
I try not to be a dick.

17:42.350 --> 17:43.669
Yeah, we all try.

17:45.430 --> 17:49.685
So, did you do it? What Hannah says
you did to her and Jessica.

17:49.770 --> 17:51.726
-What do you think?
-[Tyler] What are you doing?

17:54.150 --> 17:57.313
I'm recruiting Clay
for the Illuminati. You want to join?

17:57.410 --> 18:00.402
Alex, you should not joke
about the Illuminati, first of all.

18:00.780 --> 18:01.610
Trust me.

18:02.870 --> 18:04.440
What are you guys talking about?

18:04.540 --> 18:06.110
Homework. We've got a project.

18:06.710 --> 18:09.076
Yeah, right. The old project trope.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.917
The only class
you two have together is gym.

18:12.920 --> 18:16.708
It's creepy that you even know that.
Just go away.

18:21.890 --> 18:26.054
What I think... is that you wouldn't
do something like that.

18:26.140 --> 18:27.846
I thought you loved Jessica.

18:29.270 --> 18:30.305
Idid. I mean...

18:31.810 --> 18:33.641
Maybe I even still do, but--

18:33.730 --> 18:36.278
-Then why would you--
-We can't be talking about this.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.691
Guys.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.407
Where are you supposed to be?

18:39.950 --> 18:41.565
That's a heavy question.

18:41.660 --> 18:44.572
That's, like, existential.

18:50.040 --> 18:50.870
Okay.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.666
Clay, you can come along too.

18:55.590 --> 18:58.002
Uh, Coach Patrick sent me to the library.

18:58.090 --> 19:01.799
He has the wrong DVD for today,
so the whole class is waiting.

19:02.390 --> 19:03.288
All right.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.300
Let's catch up later.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.981
Find anything worth publishing?

19:23.660 --> 19:25.321
Oh, hardly.

19:25.410 --> 19:28.493
Just the usual angst, despair,
lovelorn crap.

19:29.580 --> 19:30.865
Uninspired.

19:33.630 --> 19:37.202
But I am planning a special issue
in memory of Hannah Baker.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.040
Maybe you have something to add?

19:40.550 --> 19:42.120
Uh, no, not really.

19:57.190 --> 19:58.179
He's still in there.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.316
Is he okay?
The credits ended five minutes ago.

20:02.570 --> 20:03.400
Here he comes.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.400
Good night, I guess.

20:08.490 --> 20:09.536
No Jessica tonight?

20:10.120 --> 20:10.950
Uh, no.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.160
So, you all good, man?

20:14.920 --> 20:15.739
Yeah.

20:16.750 --> 20:17.739
See you guys.

20:23.130 --> 20:25.086

20:26.260 --> 20:28.421
You do ticket count, I'll do concessions.

20:28.510 --> 20:29.761

-[C|ay] Yep. I got you.
-[Hannah] Okay.

20:37.730 --> 20:41.063
Okay, so now you're gonna put
your left leg over.

20:41.900 --> 20:45.279
-Yep, that's right. There you go.
-Okay.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.190
Thanks.

["The Only Boy Awake" playing]

20:49.620 --> 20:53.454
Through your window
By the water

20:53.540 --> 20:54.495
Can you see me?

20:54.580 --> 20:57.913
What am I supposed to be seeing?
- When the wind blows through...

20:58.500 --> 21:01.003
Just a shadow over the moon.

Look closely.

-Wait, I see it.

-I see it.

You know it, baby! [giggles]

23:12.600 --> 23:16.172
[softly] Oh, my gosh, Hannah Baker?
[giggIeSI

23:17.060 --> 23:18.675
Good morning, everybody.

23:18.770 --> 23:21.762
I trust you all did
the reading last night,

23:21.850 --> 23:25.069
so today we are going to jump into...

23:26.360 --> 23:30.478
social learning theory.

23:30.570 --> 23:32.947
So, the theory is that people learn

23:33.030 --> 23:36.113
by observing the behavior
of those around them.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.328
Can anybody give me an example of this?

23:39.410 --> 23:41.287
Anyone. Clay.

23:43.170 --> 23:44.580
Uh...

23:44.670 --> 23:48.663
-Yeah, an example would be like slang.
-Mm-hmm.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.547
If somebody starts saying some word,
eventually everybody's saying it.

23:51.630 --> 23:52.460
Very good.

23:52.550 --> 23:55.292
So, one person's opinion or bias

23:55.390 --> 23:57.711
can influence the rest of the group.

23:57.810 --> 24:01.098
This theory can also be applied
to criminal behavior.

24:01.190 --> 24:06.310
If a young person's friends or family
participate in deviant acts,

24:06.400 --> 24:10.234
that young person is far more likely
to do the same.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.312
[Hannah]
At first I thought
what a stupid list.

24:14.490 --> 24:17.368
Jessica is so much prettier than me.

24:17.870 --> 24:19.576
I didn ’t think of the chaos
it would cause.

24:20.660 --> 24:25.199
[Mrs. Bradley] If one person in a social
group begins to volunteer for a charity,

24:25.290 --> 24:28.293
they can influence their friends
to do the same.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.542
Hannah, I need your seat in a chair.

24:31.630 --> 24:33.040
[laughter]

24:35.840 --> 24:37.250
[Hannah]
But it was just a joke.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.921
-R/ght; A/eX?
-Okay, let's focus up.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.808
Continuing on, social media
is now playing a big part...

24:43.890 --> 24:46.188
You think I ’m taking it all
way too seriously.

24:46.270 --> 24:48.647
...connected 24/7. Right?

24:49.270 --> 24:50.851
But here ’5 the thing:

24:51.360 --> 24:52.896
You ’ve never been a girl.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.416
[sighs]

25:05.960 --> 25:07.166
It's good.

25:07.250 --> 25:09.878
We just need to work on structure,

25:09.960 --> 25:13.168
and you use the word "unique,"
like, seven times.

25:13.260 --> 25:14.750
If one thing is unique,

25:14.840 --> 25:17.673
the other six things
should probably be, um...

25:18.760 --> 25:19.590
something else.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.635
What's wrong with unique?

25:21.220 --> 25:23.768
If something's unique,
it means it's different, right?

25:23.850 --> 25:26.307
I'm saying this type
of literature is different

25:26.400 --> 25:27.765
than other kinds of literature.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.179
I mean, it is.

25:29.770 --> 25:30.850
Isn't it, Jensen?

25:33.030 --> 25:33.894
Clay.

25:36.780 --> 25:39.613
Ah. You saw the list.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.480
She does have...

25:42.580 --> 25:44.536
Unique lips. Yeah.

25:45.410 --> 25:46.536
You should get her number.

25:46.620 --> 25:49.032
-Don't want her number. I'm just...
-Thinking about kissing her.

25:49.130 --> 25:49.949
I am not.

25:52.090 --> 25:54.502
Congrats, Angie. Looking good.

25:55.260 --> 25:56.249
Thank you, Jeffrey.

25:56.340 --> 25:58.672
Shh! [whispers] Library.

26:00.390 --> 26:01.709
Looking good, Clay.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.016
Hey, Slqe. Sorry.

26:07.770 --> 26:08.759
Oh, man.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.601
Don't tell me you've got a thing
for Twilight.

26:11.690 --> 26:13.521
I don't. I mean...

26:15.030 --> 26:16.850
No, we just used to be friends.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.901
Huh. Cool.

26:20.410 --> 26:22.025
She's a pretty girl. I mean...

26:22.620 --> 26:24.611
I don't know why she dresses like that.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.740
But at least she's unique.

26:40.680 --> 26:41.635
Mind if I join?

26:42.850 --> 26:44.215
No geometry homework?

26:45.310 --> 26:46.516
No, I did it last night.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.342
My mom's prepping this trial,
so she makes us do our homework together.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.055
It's highly annoying,

26:52.150 --> 26:54.391
but I do admit it's cool
to have homework done

26:54.480 --> 26:55.936
before the period before.

26:56.780 --> 26:58.020
High school is bullshit.

26:58.860 --> 27:00.657
Yeah. Don't disagree.

27:01.030 --> 27:03.612
But... any specifics?

27:03.700 --> 27:06.783
I wish there was a button
to fast-forward you through

27:06.870 --> 27:09.407
all the shitty parts in life
straight to the good parts.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.412
And where are the good parts?

27:13.290 --> 27:15.838
College. In New York City.

27:17.170 --> 27:18.159
Why New York?

27:18.760 --> 27:21.581
The minute I get there,
I can be someone else.

27:21.930 --> 27:22.999
Whoever I want to be.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.636
But who you are now is okay.

27:26.890 --> 27:27.709
Okay?

27:28.890 --> 27:30.630
High praise. Thank you.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.890
I mean, is awesome.

27:32.980 --> 27:33.799
You're...

27:35.480 --> 27:36.890
I mean, you made the hot list.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.066
Seriously, Clay?

27:39.650 --> 27:42.027
What? They said you had the best...

27:43.160 --> 27:45.230
That's out of a lot of good candidates.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.610
Not that I've surveyed, I'm just saying.

27:48.700 --> 27:52.534
What if girls made a list
and you got... worst biceps.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.956
Girls would probably never do that list.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.369
Precisely.

27:57.920 --> 28:01.549
And my biceps are at least
better than Alex's.

28:02.050 --> 28:05.099
That kid hasn't lifted so much
as a carton of milk in years, I think.

28:05.680 --> 28:09.514
Once again, you and the point
are complete strangers.

28:20.990 --> 28:21.945
[whistle blows]

28:22.030 --> 28:22.849
Volley!

28:27.120 --> 28:30.783
Hey, uh, where were you going
on Friday night when we passed?

28:30.870 --> 28:33.361
-[students clapping]
-I was running some errands.

28:33.460 --> 28:34.950
In Hannah's old neighborhood?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.127
-[whistle blows]
-[applause]

28:39.210 --> 28:42.088
You guys got the best stores
on your side of town.

28:42.170 --> 28:43.171
Rich white folk.

28:43.260 --> 28:44.215
We're not rich.

28:48.390 --> 28:49.459
[whistle blows]

28:49.560 --> 28:51.596
-You're related to Angie Romero, right?
-Yeah.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.932
She's like my third cousin, maybe fourth.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.056
Why doesn't she go here anymore?

28:57.150 --> 28:59.141
[Tony] She transferred to Catholic school.

28:59.230 --> 29:00.185
Why?

29:01.530 --> 29:03.100
[whistle blows]

29:03.200 --> 29:06.442
I don't know. Her dad is really strict
and super Catholic.

29:07.990 --> 29:10.652
-Didn't have to do with her lips, did it?
-Her lips?

29:11.660 --> 29:14.288
-Oh, 'cause she was on the list?
-[whistle blows]

29:14.370 --> 29:17.453
[Clay] Was that list a thing for her,
like it was for Hannah?

29:17.540 --> 29:18.620
[Tony] I don't think so.

29:19.960 --> 29:20.870
But Hannah--

29:20.960 --> 29:23.167
Hannah got hurt. It happens.

29:23.260 --> 29:26.002
You never really know
what's gonna hit how.

29:27.010 --> 29:28.887
You don't know someone else's life.

29:29.550 --> 29:30.881
You would know, right?

29:31.640 --> 29:33.221
-Heads u I
-Ow! p.

29:33.310 --> 29:34.299
Son of a bitch!

29:34.390 --> 29:36.301
Jensen! Language!

29:38.020 --> 29:39.146
[whistle blows]

29:47.950 --> 29:49.406
What were you saying to Tony?

29:51.200 --> 29:53.031
Nothing, really. Why?

29:54.200 --> 29:57.533
Mr. Porter's asking questions.
Don't tell him anything.

29:57.620 --> 29:59.702
And stop talking to Tony about it.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.547
Tony's my friend.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.791
No, not right now he's not.

30:05.380 --> 30:08.258
[Zach] Yo, Standall.
Eating lunch with us later?

30:08.340 --> 30:09.170
I'm driving.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.135
Uh... Yeah, cool.

30:13.390 --> 30:15.597
Meet me at Monet's after school, okay?

30:20.650 --> 30:21.969
[door opens]

30:22.070 --> 30:24.470
Alex! Alex Standall!

30:26.240 --> 30:30.813
Alex, what the hell!
What were you thinking? Seriously!

30:30.910 --> 30:33.151
Come on. _
Hannah, you know you can't be In here.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.152
Why not? You've all been
staring at my ass all day.

30:36.830 --> 30:40.618
Hey. Hey! Get out.
It's the boys' locker room.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.704
We're not done.

30:44.670 --> 30:45.910
[clamoring]

30:50.090 --> 30:51.591
Yeah, boy!

30:51.890 --> 30:52.959
Hannah Baker.

30:53.810 --> 30:54.799
You hittin' that now?

30:54.890 --> 30:56.096
Aren't you with Jessica?

30:56.600 --> 30:58.010
Uh, no, not anymore.

30:58.100 --> 31:00.341
'Cause Jessica's a good girl, right?

31:00.440 --> 31:02.180
But Hannah Baker puts out.

31:02.770 --> 31:04.397
Yeah, man, just be careful.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.687
Hannah's a crazy bitch!

31:08.070 --> 31:11.062
Man, how is little Alex
getting more than all us?

31:11.160 --> 31:14.027
Uh, speak for yourself, big guy.
I get all I need.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.327
Come on_.
Let's go watch the girls warm up.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.246
You coming, Standall?

31:18.330 --> 31:20.662
-Or are you too hot for us now?
-[scoffs]

31:34.640 --> 31:36.926
[playing mellow tune]

31:45.360 --> 31:48.432
-Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!
-[music stops]

31:48.900 --> 31:51.949
Watch the downbeats. Yeah? Yeah?

31:52.030 --> 31:55.659
I know you can count.
Schools in this town are not that bad.

31:55.740 --> 31:56.570
Okay.

31:56.660 --> 31:58.241
Back to 15.

31:58.330 --> 31:59.820
One, two...

31:59.910 --> 32:00.956
[band playing]

32:03.040 --> 32:04.029
Stop, stop, stop.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.415
That little bump there.

32:05.500 --> 32:06.797
Alex, tempo.

32:07.380 --> 32:08.665
Fifteen, here we go.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.749
One, two...

32:09.840 --> 32:11.296
[band playing]

32:13.090 --> 32:16.469
lVo rushing, A/eX

32:16.560 --> 32:19.802
I don't know what's gotten into
you lately, but I need you to focus.

32:19.890 --> 32:21.630
It's gotta be on point for the concert.

32:22.980 --> 32:24.390
You got this. Just breathe.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.515
Leave me alone.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.725
One, two...

32:27.820 --> 32:29.856
[band playing]

32:33.990 --> 32:35.696
Oh, there he is.

32:37.990 --> 32:41.369
Yes, Alex! Love it!

32:44.330 --> 32:45.160
Go!

32:45.250 --> 32:47.206
[Jessica]
Trust me, it wﬂl be fun.

32:47.790 --> 32:49.917
So this contest is tomorrow?

32:50.010 --> 32:52.501
Yeah, but you actually have
to be there to win.

32:52.590 --> 32:53.420
I will.

32:55.050 --> 32:55.880
I promise.

32:55.970 --> 32:57.039
You promised before.

32:58.260 --> 33:00.717
There's just a lot of shit
going on at home, okay?

33:02.230 --> 33:03.629
Seth is back, so it's just...

33:04.640 --> 33:07.052
easier for me to stay at Bryce's,
that's all.

33:10.440 --> 33:11.896
-[growls]
-[chuckles]

33:11.990 --> 33:13.446
Am I supposed to be scared?

33:16.240 --> 33:17.525
Should I be, Justin?

33:18.450 --> 33:19.269
Scared.

33:19.870 --> 33:20.689
Neven

33:21.830 --> 33:23.491
There's nothing to be scared of.

33:26.290 --> 33:29.498
-Justin!
-Uh, hey, Coach.

33:30.670 --> 33:32.376
Missed you at the pep rally.

33:32.460 --> 33:33.961
And at practice.

33:34.050 --> 33:36.371
Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

33:36.470 --> 33:39.177
I've just had this stomach virus.

33:39.260 --> 33:40.921
Yeah, we just got his medicine.

33:41.010 --> 33:43.672
Mm-hmm. Everything all right at home?

33:44.270 --> 33:46.511
Yes, sir, I've just been sick.

33:47.350 --> 33:48.556
I'll be there tomorrow.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.179
I won't let you down.

33:50.270 --> 33:52.818
I'm not worried about you
letting me down, son.

33:52.900 --> 33:55.232
Colleges look at things
like school attendance,

33:55.320 --> 33:58.312
game attendance, your grades.

33:58.410 --> 33:59.365
Yes, sir.

34:00.120 --> 34:00.939
Okay.

34:01.870 --> 34:03.656
Now you take that medicine.

34:07.210 --> 34:08.416
And, son...

34:09.130 --> 34:11.166
get yourself some eye drops
while you're at it.

34:36.070 --> 34:36.889
Oh.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.986
Hey. You work here now?

34:39.570 --> 34:41.197
You drink coffee now?

34:42.530 --> 34:44.998
Yeah. I mean, I just sort of started.

34:46.160 --> 34:48.151
Look at our little Clay, all grown up.

34:50.500 --> 34:51.660
So, do you want one now?

34:53.130 --> 34:57.009
Oh, right. Uh...
A small drip, please. Black.

34:57.090 --> 34:58.500
Qu macho.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.018
Is that a lizard on your neck?

35:08.770 --> 35:09.885
It's an alligator.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.765
How many do you have now? Tattoos.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.725
Why? Do you want to give your opinion?

35:14.820 --> 35:16.469
Everyone else feels entitled to.

35:16.570 --> 35:19.312
No, I just-- I just wondered.

35:20.950 --> 35:22.269
I like the alligator.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.481
Remember that story I used to tell
about my parents

35:26.580 --> 35:28.195
every time we drove over a bridge?

35:30.290 --> 35:31.109
I remember.

35:33.340 --> 35:34.489
No, wait, I forgot.

35:35.590 --> 35:38.662
When I was little, I used to cry
every time we drove over a bridge.

35:38.760 --> 35:39.829
I don't know why.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.888
My mom used to try to distract me--

35:41.970 --> 35:44.848
And she would tell you to look
for a purple alligator in the water,

35:44.930 --> 35:47.922
and you'd be so busy looking
you'd forget you were scared.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.805
Yeah, that's the story.

35:57.610 --> 35:58.565
It's on the house.

36:00.700 --> 36:01.598
Oh.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.481
[door opens]

36:10.330 --> 36:12.070
[M r. Porter]
Do you think it might have been

36:12.170 --> 36:13.785
Clay who tore the posters down?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.279
I don't think so.

36:15.380 --> 36:18.918
Clay and I are pretty close.
It's just not something he would do.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.079
[Mr. Porter] Hmm.

36:20.170 --> 36:23.503
Can you think of anyone else who might
have wanted to act out like that,

36:23.590 --> 36:27.048
about suicide
or Hannah Baker's suicide?

36:27.140 --> 36:28.960
I can't think of anyone in particular.

36:29.770 --> 36:32.557
No, I...
I know it's hit a lot of kids hard.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.016
You two were friends with Hannah?

36:35.110 --> 36:36.304
Well, "friends" is--

36:36.400 --> 36:38.607
I had a couple of classes with her.

36:38.690 --> 36:44.151
No, but she wasn't involved in much,
student council or anything, so...

36:44.240 --> 36:45.116
[Mr. Porter] Hm.

36:45.660 --> 36:47.730
Did she ever talk
about how she was feeling?

36:47.830 --> 36:50.446
Most of the time
she seemed pretty Chill to me.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.577
I guess there were times
she was emotional.

36:54.790 --> 36:56.200
But who isn't?

36:56.290 --> 36:57.530
[Mr. Porter] Yeah, that's true.

36:58.170 --> 37:04.040
I'm just trying to look out for the kids
who got hit extra hard by this.

37:04.130 --> 37:06.883
I spoke with Alex Standall today.

37:09.930 --> 37:11.340
How many espressos are in there?

37:11.930 --> 37:13.090
A lot.

37:14.850 --> 37:16.431
I just started drinking coffee.

37:17.270 --> 37:19.010
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.

37:19.480 --> 37:20.890
I get anxiety.

37:21.480 --> 37:22.606
Yeah, me too.

37:24.740 --> 37:25.980
So, did you do it?

37:26.490 --> 37:29.573
I mean, did you put Hannah
and Jessica on that list?

37:29.660 --> 37:30.695
You didn't know that?

37:30.790 --> 37:32.360
But you saw it.

37:32.450 --> 37:35.613
Yeah, but I didn't, like,
trace the handwriting.

37:35.710 --> 37:37.666
I didn't think it was that big a deal.

37:38.210 --> 37:39.450
Do you think she's right?

37:39.540 --> 37:42.623
Does everything that happened to her
go back to you and that list?

37:43.260 --> 37:46.582
Well, I think it all started
the night of Jessica's party.

37:51.220 --> 37:52.847
What did she say about Jessica's party?

37:54.230 --> 37:55.549
Does she mention me there?

37:56.640 --> 37:58.141
Where are you in the tapes?

37:58.730 --> 37:59.936
I'm almost through yours.

38:00.020 --> 38:01.510
Holy shit, Clay. I mean...

38:02.110 --> 38:04.351
I listened to 'em all in one night
the first time.

38:04.440 --> 38:05.941
You listened more than once?

38:06.030 --> 38:07.657
I listened to 'em twice.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.822
Thought maybe
I'd dreamed the whole thing.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.867
Wait, so you haven't heard your own tape?

38:15.250 --> 38:16.239
No.

38:16.330 --> 38:18.742
I can only listen
in bits and pieces, or I...

38:20.210 --> 38:21.666
I freak out.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.831
I feel a panic attack coming on.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.876
Aren't you desperate
to hear yours, though?

38:28.510 --> 38:29.579
I'm afraid to.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.006
Well, you should be.

38:33.100 --> 38:35.261
But I mean, seriously, it was just a list.

38:35.350 --> 38:37.011
Like, a stupid high school thing.

38:37.100 --> 38:40.149
That fucking list.
I wish I never touched that fucking list.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.219
Why did you?

38:42.320 --> 38:44.140
I don't know. Bryce started it.

38:44.230 --> 38:46.312
All the guys were working on it at lunch.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.482
Why are you even friends with those guys?

38:48.570 --> 38:50.197
Justin, Zach, Bryce.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.362
No, see, I'm not friends with Bryce.

38:53.450 --> 38:54.530
But the other guys,

38:54.620 --> 38:57.282
Zach and I got to be friends last year,

38:57.370 --> 38:59.281
and he's always hanging around Justin.

38:59.370 --> 39:00.826
They thought it was funny and stuff.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.707
My dad was relieved
that I had male friends.

39:04.800 --> 39:08.543
Also, didn't totally suck at school
that Justin Foley liked me back then.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.000
Okay, back then.

39:12.010 --> 39:13.420
Why are you friends now?

39:13.510 --> 39:17.219
Because if I stop hanging out,
they're gonna know something's up.

39:17.310 --> 39:19.050
I shouldn't even be talking to you.

39:19.140 --> 39:20.937
-Seriously?
-Yes.

39:21.020 --> 39:23.727
But you don't even deserve to be on there.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.640
I mean, you meant it as a compliment.

39:26.730 --> 39:28.857
No. No.

39:29.950 --> 39:33.158
I meant it to piss Jessica off.
Because she wouldn't have sex with me.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.031
Alex. Don't.

39:41.290 --> 39:43.076
That doesn't seem like you.

39:43.170 --> 39:45.661
Yeah, it doesn't, does it? But it was.

39:46.840 --> 39:50.048
And the guys already thought
that we were, and I wanted to.

39:50.130 --> 39:52.337
You know? I-I loved her.

39:53.050 --> 39:55.553
And it did piss Jessica off,
but not at me.

39:56.140 --> 39:57.209
At Hannah.

39:57.310 --> 39:58.379
Alex did this on his own.

39:58.470 --> 40:00.768
He just broke up with me on his own.

40:01.390 --> 40:02.220
Enjoy it.

40:02.310 --> 40:03.720
'Cause you will, won't you?

40:03.810 --> 40:05.357
'Cause that's what sluts do.

40:05.900 --> 40:06.719
Fuck you.

40:08.570 --> 40:11.698
[Alex] So not only did everyone think
Hannah gave it up for me...

40:12.450 --> 40:14.236
I took away her best friend.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.037
And who knows?

40:18.120 --> 40:19.690
If she had a friend, maybe...

40:23.460 --> 40:24.279
It's okay, man.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.916
No, it's not. It's not okay.

40:26.670 --> 40:29.298
You want it to be okay
because then you get off the hook,

40:29.380 --> 40:30.586
but you're losing your shit.

40:30.670 --> 40:34.219
You want to think whatever you did
couldn't be why Hannah killed herself.

40:34.300 --> 40:37.133
But the truth is that I did,
I killed Hannah Baker!

40:37.220 --> 40:40.269
And Justin killed Hannah Baker.
And Jessica. And you.

40:40.350 --> 40:41.760
We all killed Hannah Baker.

40:43.270 --> 40:45.261
Maybe you need some chamomile tea.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.975
'Cause people are listening?

40:47.070 --> 40:49.470
Well, it's too bad
no one paid attention before.

40:49.570 --> 40:50.889
[door opens]

40:56.320 --> 40:58.072
-What is that about?
-I told you.

40:58.160 --> 41:00.902
He's not your friend.
He's not even on the tapes.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.286
Tony, he's in this for Tony.

41:04.290 --> 41:06.246
Alex. Alex!

41:06.330 --> 41:07.957
[door opens]

41:08.630 --> 41:09.745
Who's that?

41:12.590 --> 41:14.967
He's just a friend. His name is Clay.

41:15.050 --> 41:16.335
Was he friends with Hannah?

41:17.680 --> 41:19.307
I'm not sure how close they were.

41:24.890 --> 41:26.642
[Hannah]
You want evidence, Alex?

41:27.520 --> 41:29.511
You want storm clouds and thunder?

41:30.940 --> 41:32.988
Let’s go to 5-3 on your maps, everyone.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.867
The Blue Spot liquor store. . .

41:41.620 --> 41:43.326
where butterfly met hurricane.

41:45.540 --> 41:48.577
The Blue Spot was a block and a half away
from my first house here.

41:49.790 --> 41:50.620
Hey, Wally.

41:50.710 --> 41:51.836
Oh, hey.

41:51.920 --> 41:55.469
And I went there whenever
I desperately needed chocolate,

41:55.550 --> 41:58.792
which was, l/ke, most days of the week.

41:59.800 --> 42:03.054
Why do you even sell candy bars
that don't have nuts in them?

42:03.140 --> 42:04.880
'Cause some people don't like nuts.

42:04.980 --> 42:07.437
And some people are allergic.

42:08.020 --> 42:09.601
Some people are tragic.

42:10.190 --> 42:12.272
-What's up, Wally?
-What's up?

42:22.790 --> 42:25.702
So, I see you went for nuts again.

42:26.250 --> 42:27.990
That's how you talk to a lady, Wally?

42:29.000 --> 42:30.069
I got the candy.

42:31.790 --> 42:35.294
Your parents own Baker Drugs, right?
But you buy candy here?

42:35.760 --> 42:37.967
Um, better selection.

42:38.050 --> 42:40.462
And fewer moms counting my calorie intake.

42:42.470 --> 42:43.425
There you go.

42:45.770 --> 42:48.341
-Did you just--?
-Oh, no, I didn't mean...

42:48.980 --> 42:50.299
It's just...

42:50.400 --> 42:51.515
It's real tight.

42:52.610 --> 42:54.680
In the store. It's tight in the store.

42:56.360 --> 42:59.523
I don't usually listen
to sophomore gossip, but, um...

43:00.490 --> 43:03.232
for what it's worth,
that list got it right.

43:11.170 --> 43:12.626
[Hannah]
It seems l/ke nothing.

43:14.500 --> 43:16.081
Unt/l the hurricane hits.

43:16.170 --> 43:18.661
Because when you put
my name on that list

43:18.760 --> 43:20.637
you put a target on my.. .

43:21.680 --> 43:23.841
well, it wasn ’t just my ass.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.978
You made it open season
on Hannah Baker.

43:51.670 --> 43:53.285
Hi, are-- are you Wally?

43:53.380 --> 43:54.995
No. Wally's off.

44:10.850 --> 44:11.839
What's up, my man?

44:11.940 --> 44:13.476
Hey, how you doin', Bryce?

44:16.900 --> 44:17.935
What's up, Jensen?

44:18.030 --> 44:19.566
Uh, hey, Bryce.

44:19.650 --> 44:20.730
You live around here?

44:20.820 --> 44:23.232
Um, no. A friend told me about it.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.150
Yeah, me too.

44:24.740 --> 44:25.946
It's an easy card.

44:26.910 --> 44:29.117
You looking for a cold one? Tough day?

44:29.700 --> 44:30.530
No, Ijust...

44:30.620 --> 44:34.249
I came to grab some
sugary carbonated matter.

44:35.460 --> 44:37.030
Stuff's not good for you, man.

44:37.130 --> 44:39.121
What you need's something all-natural.

44:41.090 --> 44:41.909
Malt liquor.

-Sure I do.

You're welcome.

No, I really gotta--

No, the least you can do is drink with us.

Come on. Drink your 40.

-Wait, to drink it all?
-Yes. To drink it all.

There's two ways you leave, Jensen:
buzzed or beat down.

Come on, Jensen, don't be a bitch!

-Why are you following me?

I wasn't. I saw you with Alex.
I thought you were on his tape.

Just one beer.

51:47.560 --> 51:49.175
[grunting]

51:49.270 --> 51:50.305
Oh, fuck.

51:50.390 --> 51:51.800

The butten7y effect

51:53.230 --> 51:55.061
It started with Justin,

51:55.150 --> 51:56.777
then on to you, Alex.

51:57.900 --> 51:58.776
And the rest of you.

52:01.570 --> 52:04.061
Maybe these tapes wﬂl start
a new butten‘ly effect

52:05.160 --> 52:05.979
Who knows?

52:07.490 --> 52:10.539
Everything affects everything.

52:10.620 --> 52:12.747
My, my

52:12.830 --> 52:14.991
Hey, hey

52:19.470 --> 52:23.793
Rock’n roll is here to stay

52:28.350 --> 52:31.092
It’s better to burn out

52:32.270 --> 52:35.148
Than to fade away

52:37.230 --> 52:38.970
My, my

52:39.320 --> 52:40.685
Hey, hey

52:54.540 --> 52:59.375
Out of the blue and into the black

53:03.220 --> 53:08.055
I give you this
But you pay for that

53:11.980 --> 53:14.687
And once you ’re gone

53:14.770 --> 53:19.309
You can never come back

53:19.400 --> 53:23.188
When you ’re out of the blue

53:23.280 --> 53:25.737
Into the black

54:09.370 --> 54:10.405
[song fades]

54:12.950 --> 54:14.190
[Hannah]
Shh.

54:14.660 --> 54:18.664
For this next one,
you need to be very, very quiet

54:26.720 --> 54:29.177
Because you ’re about to do
something very wrong.

54:54.750 --> 54:55.694
Be careful.

54:57.330 --> 54:58.706
And don ’t get caught

55:01.130 --> 55:03.121
[dramatic rock music]
