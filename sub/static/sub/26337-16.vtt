you can do, Roe?

02:15.445 --> 02:17.654

I have it in me.

02:17.758 --> 02:18.759

02:29.666 --> 02:33.049
And the quarter million dollarsalary that comes with it.

02:49.652 --> 02:51.861
I'm happy I got all of you.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.864
Mia has stuck it out, and she'sproved a lot of people wrong.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.659
And she's had a lot
of people doubt her.

02:56.762 --> 02:57.832
I always root for the underdog.

02:57.936 --> 02:59.282
Like, I would love
to see Mia win.

02:59.386 --> 03:00.214
MIA: So--

03:00.318 --> 03:01.388
Start with apps,
just in general?

03:01.491 --> 03:02.561
Yep.
Yep.

03:02.665 --> 03:03.493
All right.

03:03.597 --> 03:06.427
You guys know what mofongo is?

03:06.531 --> 03:08.395
Mon-fon-- mon-fon-- mofongo?

03:08.498 --> 03:09.361
What the hell is that?

03:09.465 --> 03:10.293
Croquettes.

03:10.397 --> 03:11.812
I'll just say croquettes.- Yeah.

03:11.915 --> 03:12.744
OK.

03:12.847 --> 03:14.159
It goes with a salsa criolla.

03:16.886 --> 03:19.475
Mia's menu is definitely Mia.

03:19.578 --> 03:20.717
I'll make the marinade.

03:20.821 --> 03:22.685
It's just a [inaudible]--

03:22.788 --> 03:25.688
Peruvian this
and Peruvian that.

03:25.791 --> 03:27.414
Peruvian causa.

03:27.517 --> 03:29.312
Could you spell that for me?

03:29.416 --> 03:32.384
C-A-U-S-A. Causa.

03:35.145 --> 03:36.768
The way there we're goingto start everything here

03:36.871 --> 03:38.494
is pretty much Latin flavors.

03:38.597 --> 03:39.874
Kind of a modern Mexican menu.

03:40.841 --> 03:42.152
OK.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.431
I'm going to do the dish thatI have one table side with.

03:44.534 --> 03:47.296
The albondigas
dumpling posole soup.

03:47.399 --> 03:50.437
It's going to be,
like, two pot stickers.

03:50.540 --> 03:51.541
Mhm.

03:51.645 --> 03:53.923
I think my teamdefinitely believes in me.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.718
Everyone's really engaged.

03:55.821 --> 03:59.791
The sauce is a very reduced,rich jus that's then blended.

03:59.894 --> 04:02.034
And I think that
they honestly believe

04:02.138 --> 04:04.796
that I should be the one
to win this competition.

04:04.899 --> 04:07.177
I'm going to do my signaturebrown butter butterscotch,

04:07.281 --> 04:10.250
but with a sweet
corn [inaudible]..

04:10.353 --> 04:13.114
Ariel is confident
as fuck with her menu.

04:13.218 --> 04:15.841
I am more than happy
to be on her team

04:15.945 --> 04:17.947
to help her win this
competition, which

04:18.050 --> 04:19.086
she deserves.

04:19.189 --> 04:21.985
Tomorrow is also a
test of us as a brigade,

04:22.089 --> 04:23.504
and me leading a brigade.

04:23.608 --> 04:24.678
It's going to be, like, loud.- For sure.

04:24.781 --> 04:26.058
Uh-huh.

04:26.162 --> 04:26.783
We're going to be, like,engaged, and it's going to be,

04:26.887 --> 04:27.888
like--
- Fuck yeah.

04:27.991 --> 04:28.992
- All right?
- Cool.

04:29.096 --> 04:30.097
18.

04:30.200 --> 04:30.718
You guys are going
to kill it tomorrow.

04:30.822 --> 04:31.719
Yeah.

04:31.823 --> 04:34.239
Kill it.

04:34.343 --> 04:35.999
And then, um, potato puree.

04:36.103 --> 04:37.967
The potato does not
go in the [inaudible]..

04:38.070 --> 04:40.901
I'll show you guys how to do it,but just so you have an idea--

04:41.004 --> 04:42.178
This is going to
go down to the wire,

04:42.282 --> 04:43.559
I have no doubt in my mind.

04:43.662 --> 04:46.355
MIA: I'm going to serve it inthe little round style pans.

04:46.458 --> 04:47.942
This is, like, the
young up and comer

04:48.046 --> 04:50.186
versus the seasoned
veteran, but I think Mia

04:50.290 --> 04:52.499
is a force to be reckoned with.

04:52.602 --> 04:54.155
All right, entree--
chicken dish.

04:54.259 --> 04:55.571
OK.

04:55.674 --> 04:58.125
Throw it in the oven, and thenwe finish it in the brick oven.

04:58.228 --> 05:00.679
Well, you could cook itthree quarters, if not almost

05:00.783 --> 05:03.544
the whole way, let it
rest, and then bang,

05:03.648 --> 05:05.166
finish it right with hot apps.

05:05.270 --> 05:06.064
OK.

05:06.167 --> 05:07.237
Awesome.

05:07.341 --> 05:11.034
Mia and I didn't have
the greatest departure.

05:11.138 --> 05:12.898
You didn't have the proteinthat he was asking you for.

05:13.002 --> 05:14.072
Right.

05:14.175 --> 05:15.418
And that's where I had
asked you all day, so I

05:15.522 --> 05:16.661
could have the protein ready.

05:16.764 --> 05:18.766
And you couldn't do thatbecause you had a hard time

05:18.870 --> 05:20.078
reheating vegetables.

05:20.181 --> 05:23.909
As much as I don't like her,I know what it's like to not

05:24.013 --> 05:26.567
have people 110% behind you.

05:26.671 --> 05:27.879
My fish is dying!

05:27.982 --> 05:28.914
It's dying!

05:29.018 --> 05:30.226
I'm walking in 30
seconds, Heather!

05:30.330 --> 05:31.779
Don't give me raw food, Kim.

05:31.883 --> 05:32.849
I would run if I was you.

05:32.953 --> 05:33.850
OK?

05:33.954 --> 05:35.404
- All right, Heather.
- It's raw.

05:35.507 --> 05:36.784
- It needs to be flashed, yeah.- Ugh.

05:36.888 --> 05:38.096
Come on, Kim.

05:38.199 --> 05:39.580
You're giving me raw meat, man.- Are you kidding me?

05:39.684 --> 05:40.132
They've been in--

05:40.236 --> 05:40.926
Get off meat.

05:41.030 --> 05:42.272
Devin, take over.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.965
So I'm going to give
her my heart and my soul

05:45.068 --> 05:46.622
on my station, and that's that.

05:46.725 --> 05:48.486
All right, any
questions, guys?

05:48.589 --> 05:49.935
Who do you want where?

05:50.039 --> 05:51.937
Who do you feelcomfortable putting where?

05:52.041 --> 05:52.869
Let me see.

05:52.973 --> 05:54.284

05:54.388 --> 05:56.908
Yeah.

06:36.085 --> 06:38.570
into prep for the final time.

06:38.674 --> 06:39.778
Ready, guys?
Ready to rock?

06:39.882 --> 06:41.021
- Ready.
- Yes, chef.

06:41.124 --> 06:42.471
Awesome.

06:42.574 --> 06:45.784
This is definitely one of themost important days of my life.

06:45.888 --> 06:46.854
[counting in spanish]

06:46.958 --> 06:47.752
One more.

06:47.855 --> 06:49.201
That's it.

06:49.305 --> 06:52.066
Everybody needs to be focused,and everybody needs to remember

06:52.170 --> 06:54.414
that this is all business.

06:54.517 --> 06:55.311
Apples are in?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.312
Where's the apples?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.589
- I'm making brown butter.- Oh.

06:57.693 --> 06:58.487
Thank you.

06:58.590 --> 06:59.384
I'm like, hold on.

06:59.488 --> 07:01.041
Yeah.
Jump on the apples.

07:01.144 --> 07:02.145
She's working on
the brown butter,

07:02.249 --> 07:03.561
and then finish up
the chimichurri.

07:03.664 --> 07:04.803
That's already peeled.

07:04.907 --> 07:06.080
Like, everything's
done for the apples.

07:06.184 --> 07:07.392
You just have to lay them out.

07:07.496 --> 07:09.532
Mia definitely knows
what she wants,

07:09.636 --> 07:12.224
but her brain is just a bigfucking jumbled mess right now.

07:12.328 --> 07:14.503
Where's my crispy pancetta?

07:14.606 --> 07:16.090
That was the pork
fat that you gave me.

07:16.194 --> 07:16.884
And then--
- Yes.

07:16.988 --> 07:17.885
Where's the pancetta?

07:17.989 --> 07:18.817
No idea.

07:18.921 --> 07:19.956
OK, so we need to find it.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.130
OK.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.581
Mia needs to re-fucking-lax.

07:23.684 --> 07:25.306
Find the pancetta.
You find the pancetta.

07:25.410 --> 07:25.721
I'm good over here.
Find the pancetta.

07:25.824 --> 07:26.860
Heard.

07:26.963 --> 07:27.999
And I need you to hurry
on that mango sauce.

07:28.102 --> 07:29.241
OK, Jose?

07:29.345 --> 07:30.139
Yep.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.071
[sigh]

07:32.348 --> 07:33.522
I don't like this [inaudible].Who did this?

07:33.625 --> 07:34.661
No.

07:34.764 --> 07:36.007
No, I was trying to get
your attention, and--

07:36.110 --> 07:36.904
Oh, sorry.

07:37.008 --> 07:38.147
OK.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.217
Don't slow down.

07:39.320 --> 07:40.839
If you want us
to be successful

07:40.943 --> 07:43.014
and drive you to
victory, you need to be

07:43.117 --> 07:44.187
able to be a great leader.

07:44.291 --> 07:46.120
And she's being a
little dictator.

07:46.224 --> 07:47.397
I am just a peon.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.295
Keep working.

07:51.574 --> 07:52.575
You want basil leaves?

07:52.679 --> 07:53.473
Yes.

07:53.576 --> 07:54.612
Thai basil or basil?

07:54.715 --> 07:56.130
- Just basil.- I thought it was Thai basil.

07:56.234 --> 07:57.304
If we have Thai
basil, Thai basil.

07:57.407 --> 07:58.512
If not, just basil.

07:58.616 --> 07:59.409
And cilantro.

08:02.309 --> 08:04.207
In between, you want to
gently take your fingers

08:04.311 --> 08:06.244
and loosen these up a
little bit, because that

08:06.347 --> 08:07.694
has some good sour-ness.

08:07.797 --> 08:09.523
What I'm gonna do is I'mgonna probably sweeten up

08:09.627 --> 08:11.491
that vinaigrette just a touch.

08:11.594 --> 08:13.285
Looking back on the
last time I was here,

08:13.389 --> 08:14.908
it's like night and day.

08:15.011 --> 08:19.913
That, you know, insecure,unsure young woman is long gone.

08:20.016 --> 08:21.224
What?
I'm sorry.

08:21.328 --> 08:22.156
I thought one of these--

08:22.260 --> 08:23.606
Would you send
that lamb if you

08:23.710 --> 08:25.263
were standing at the
Araxi Restaurant,

08:25.366 --> 08:26.264
whistler on the hot plate?

08:26.367 --> 08:27.437
- No, chef.
- Tell me!

08:27.541 --> 08:28.335
No, chef.

08:28.438 --> 08:31.027
[bleep]

08:31.131 --> 08:33.961
What you see today is someonewho knows they belong here,

08:34.065 --> 08:36.412
knows they want this, and theyknow they're going to get it.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.345
You guys want to look atplates with me for a minute?

08:38.448 --> 08:39.242
Yeah.

08:39.346 --> 08:40.381
I'd love your opinion.

08:40.485 --> 08:42.418
SCOTLEY: As a leader,
Ariel's very vocal,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.903
very detailed about everything.

08:45.007 --> 08:45.973
Oh, I like this.

08:46.077 --> 08:47.354
This is nice.

08:47.457 --> 08:49.011
I like this for this soup.

08:49.114 --> 08:51.151
SCOTLEY: Even though
she's leading the team,

08:51.254 --> 08:52.842
we are really in this together.

08:52.946 --> 08:55.845
And you know, that
brings up the morale.

08:55.949 --> 08:58.158
We're gonna all
finish strong today.

08:58.261 --> 09:03.508
There's gonna be a partyin your honor tonight.

09:03.612 --> 09:04.923
The best thing about
a true champion--

09:05.027 --> 09:07.132
Muhammad Ali, Bruce
Lee, Mike Tyson--

09:07.236 --> 09:09.307
they won the fight before theyeven stepped into the ring

09:09.410 --> 09:10.204
with their opponents.

09:10.308 --> 09:11.240
You know what I'm saying?

09:11.343 --> 09:12.172
I got you, homie.

09:12.275 --> 09:13.207
MOTTO: You know what I'm saying?

09:13.311 --> 09:14.381
Here you go.

09:14.484 --> 09:15.831
We're gonna sweep the
floor with 'em, chef.

09:15.934 --> 09:18.143
Oh, Motto, I love
your one liners.

09:18.247 --> 09:19.559
[laughter]

09:23.114 --> 09:25.634
NARRATOR: It's two hours beforethe final dinner service.

09:25.737 --> 09:26.600
Right, we ready?

09:26.704 --> 09:27.912
Yes, chef.

09:28.015 --> 09:30.466
NARRATOR: And Chef Ramsay isabout to do his last check

09:30.570 --> 09:33.158
on Mia and Ariel's menus
to see if they live

09:33.262 --> 09:35.471
up to his high expectations.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.404
Visually, when you start fromhere, you all the way down,

09:37.507 --> 09:38.508
what do you see?

09:38.612 --> 09:39.993
- A lot of color.
- A lot of color.

09:40.096 --> 09:40.890
You're absolutely right.

09:40.994 --> 09:42.236
A lot of color.

09:42.340 --> 09:45.826
I feel great about my menuand I've had great feedback,

09:45.930 --> 09:47.828
so I'm using all
of that feedback

09:47.932 --> 09:50.935
just to elevate these dishes,and to really nail them.

09:51.038 --> 09:51.832
Right.

09:51.936 --> 09:53.040
Risotto.

09:53.144 --> 09:55.249
So we have a
sweet pea risotto,

09:55.353 --> 09:56.941
basil, lemon zest, pancetta.

09:57.044 --> 09:58.080
Delicious.

09:58.183 --> 09:59.253
Really good, indeed.
OK.

09:59.357 --> 10:00.185
Next one?

10:00.289 --> 10:01.911
This is the Peruvian causa.

10:02.015 --> 10:05.087
We have the [inaudible]
potatoes, avocado cream,

10:05.190 --> 10:07.123
and hamachi ceviche.

10:07.227 --> 10:11.196
You know, it's a cold, dense,sweet puree with the avocado.

10:11.300 --> 10:12.370
Chili, the heat-- love it.

10:12.473 --> 10:13.267
Mhm?

10:13.371 --> 10:14.855
The girl can cook.

10:14.959 --> 10:16.305
Next?

10:16.408 --> 10:18.963
So it's no surprise that ChefRamsay is really loving the way

10:19.066 --> 10:20.861
her menu is coming together.

10:20.965 --> 10:22.311
So we have the
mofongo croquettas.

10:22.414 --> 10:23.208
GORDON RAMSAY: Mhm.

10:23.312 --> 10:24.278
I lightened them up today.

10:24.382 --> 10:25.728
It's more potato,
we didn't blend it.

10:25.832 --> 10:27.281
So they should be a lot softer.

10:27.385 --> 10:28.179
Mhm.

10:28.282 --> 10:29.456
Wow.

10:29.559 --> 10:30.871
Wow, wow, wow.

10:30.975 --> 10:32.079
Next?

10:32.183 --> 10:36.946
So we have soy ginger
glazed churrasco.

10:37.050 --> 10:38.879
Fresh mango sauce.

10:38.983 --> 10:41.433
Pickled bok choy
and fresh mangoes.

10:41.537 --> 10:42.952
Delicious.
Really good, indeed.

10:43.056 --> 10:44.195
- Thank you, chef.
- Pass it down, please.

10:44.298 --> 10:45.679
Next one.

10:45.783 --> 10:47.992
So we have grilled
pork medallions,

10:48.095 --> 10:52.721
chorizo chimichurri, potatopuree, and sweet plantain.

10:52.824 --> 10:53.653
Mhm.

10:53.756 --> 10:55.344
Now, that is
seasoned beautifully.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.241
I mean, really beautifully.

10:56.345 --> 10:57.346
On point.

10:57.449 --> 10:58.485
I think there are
some great plays here.

10:58.588 --> 10:59.624
Yes, chef.

10:59.728 --> 11:01.143
I think the diners are
going to be pleasantly

11:01.246 --> 11:03.007
surprised with my food.

11:03.110 --> 11:06.182
I feel like I'm bringingsomething new to LA right now.

11:06.286 --> 11:07.805
So I'm really excited.

11:07.908 --> 11:08.875
Right.
Ariel?

11:08.978 --> 11:09.772
Yes, chef?

11:09.876 --> 11:11.187
Let's go.

11:11.291 --> 11:13.742
First of all, what's the messageyou're sending to your clients?

11:13.845 --> 11:16.399
ARIEL: This is a modernLatin cuisine with a hint

11:16.503 --> 11:17.677
of Asian influence into it.

11:17.780 --> 11:18.885
GORDON RAMSAY: Right.

11:18.988 --> 11:21.991
It's very approachable,clean flavors, and simple.

11:22.095 --> 11:23.683
I think chef's going
to like my menu.

11:23.786 --> 11:26.133
We have a lot of good,
clean flavors here.

11:26.237 --> 11:27.410
Layers and layers.

11:27.514 --> 11:28.549
First appetizer?

11:28.653 --> 11:31.587
First appetizer is
the shrimp ceviche roja.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.520
That's served with
an avocado mousse.

11:33.623 --> 11:34.555
Visually, it looks beautiful.

11:34.659 --> 11:35.487
Great colors here.

11:35.591 --> 11:37.938
Does it need the
puree underneath?

11:38.042 --> 11:39.595
I was just holding
the chips in place,

11:39.699 --> 11:42.011
but if we don't need it,we can go without it, chef.

11:42.115 --> 11:42.978
Quick taste.

11:43.081 --> 11:43.875
Christina?

11:43.979 --> 11:44.980
A little salty, chef.

11:45.083 --> 11:45.912
A little?

11:46.015 --> 11:47.051
A lot salty, chef.

11:47.154 --> 11:48.569
That's not a little
salty, that is fucking--

11:49.570 --> 11:50.433
Very salty.

11:50.537 --> 11:51.607
Next.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.023
Next we have thealbondigas dumpling sopa.

11:54.127 --> 11:57.026
This is the broth
with the hominy in it.

11:57.130 --> 11:59.132
I never work
with even numbers.

11:59.235 --> 12:01.755
Visually on a plate,
I go 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

12:01.859 --> 12:02.963
It needs to be exuberant.

12:03.067 --> 12:03.861
You need to be generous.

12:03.964 --> 12:05.414
And so make three.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.831
But my big worry
there is the filling.

12:08.935 --> 12:10.453
That filling needs to
be that magical moment,

12:10.557 --> 12:13.974
and all I've got is thisdense, under-seasoned pork.

12:14.078 --> 12:15.182
Next?

12:15.286 --> 12:17.046
This is the rib
cap mole, chef.

12:17.150 --> 12:18.496
Mhm.

12:18.599 --> 12:21.292
ARIEL: With yellow beet puree,roasted thumbelina carrots, and

12:21.395 --> 12:24.398
the chocolate red wine demi.

12:24.502 --> 12:25.503
It tastes very meaty.

12:25.606 --> 12:27.712
Very pasty.

12:27.816 --> 12:31.198
There's no seasoning in there.

12:31.302 --> 12:33.442
This is the [inaudible].

12:33.545 --> 12:37.239
We did a loup de mer tonightinstead of the mackerel.

12:37.342 --> 12:38.378
Could we not get mackerel?

12:38.481 --> 12:39.482
No, we could.

12:39.586 --> 12:41.381
We decided to change
it just because more

12:41.484 --> 12:43.935
guests will enjoy the
Mediterranean sea bass,

12:44.039 --> 12:44.867
I think.

12:44.971 --> 12:46.248
Your mackerel was a big hit.

12:46.351 --> 12:47.421
What did the judge say?

12:47.525 --> 12:48.975
Choosing mackerel--
I mean, that's risky.

12:49.078 --> 12:50.873
There's a lot of
people-- you know?

12:50.977 --> 12:53.462
But I love mackerel, andI think it's very hearty.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.119
The flavor was great.

12:55.222 --> 12:57.190
He said that it was
quite a risk, and not

12:57.293 --> 12:59.330
very many people loved mackerel,but it was done very well.

12:59.433 --> 13:00.227
So--

13:03.161 --> 13:05.405
How do I say this?

13:05.508 --> 13:07.959
Without sounding like I'mtrying to dent your conference.

13:15.035 --> 13:17.037
NARRATOR: It's two hours beforethe final dinner service.

13:17.141 --> 13:17.969
Right.

13:18.073 --> 13:18.936
We ready?

13:19.039 --> 13:20.282
Yes, chef.

13:20.385 --> 13:22.353
NARRATOR: And Chef Ramsay isgiving last minute feedback

13:22.456 --> 13:24.251
on Mia and Ariel's dishes.

13:24.355 --> 13:25.252
First appetizer.

13:25.356 --> 13:26.529
NARRATOR: And while
rookie finalist

13:26.633 --> 13:28.669
Mia received rave reviews--

13:28.773 --> 13:29.809
Delicious.

13:29.912 --> 13:32.018
NARRATOR: Chef Ramsay
is less than impressed

13:32.121 --> 13:34.020
with veteran Ariel's menu.

13:34.123 --> 13:34.917
[sigh]

13:35.021 --> 13:36.263
How do I say this?

13:36.367 --> 13:40.474
Without sounding like I'mtrying to dent your confidence.

13:40.578 --> 13:42.407
Stop running from success.

13:42.511 --> 13:44.789
The mackerel was a hit.

13:44.893 --> 13:46.722
You may not have
won that challenge,

13:46.826 --> 13:48.137
but you haven't lost the finale.

13:48.241 --> 13:49.035
Yes, chef.

13:49.138 --> 13:50.553
So get confident.

13:50.657 --> 13:51.831
- OK.
- Yeah?

13:51.934 --> 13:53.246
- Yes.- I want to see Ariel back.

13:53.349 --> 13:54.523
OK.
Thank you, chef.

13:54.626 --> 13:55.835
I had a horrible start.

13:55.938 --> 13:58.320
There is a tweak on eachplate, but all of his feedback

13:58.423 --> 13:59.666
made sense.

13:59.769 --> 14:01.392
We're going to go back tomackerel because that's what

14:01.495 --> 14:02.911
the dish was intended to be.

14:03.014 --> 14:05.292
So these guys are going tokick it into high gear for me

14:05.396 --> 14:07.329
right now, and we're
going to knock this out.

14:07.432 --> 14:09.779
Kanae, I want to get
more duck fat in there.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.333
It's just a little bland.

14:11.436 --> 14:14.198
More salt, less peat, andthen a squeeze of lemon.

14:14.301 --> 14:15.958
The food's looking
good and we're

14:16.062 --> 14:18.064
going to put the heart andsoul, and all the flavor

14:18.167 --> 14:19.410
into each dish.

14:19.513 --> 14:21.377
That's what my food
is about-- flavor.

14:21.481 --> 14:22.758
Love.
Do or die time.

14:22.862 --> 14:23.655
I'm ready.

14:23.759 --> 14:24.622
I've been ready.

14:24.725 --> 14:26.037
I need everybody
to kind of start

14:26.141 --> 14:27.832
setting up their stations, OK?

14:27.936 --> 14:30.870
You guys should be doinglast minute things right now.

14:30.973 --> 14:33.010
How are we looking on
apps over there, Kanae?

14:33.113 --> 14:35.115
KANAE: I still gotta pushout all these dumplings.

14:35.219 --> 14:38.153
And if I don't get 'em donenow, it's gonna be hell.

14:38.256 --> 14:39.292
Communicate, OK?

14:39.395 --> 14:40.949
All right?
Thank you, guys.

14:41.052 --> 14:41.846
Come on, guys.

14:41.950 --> 14:43.089
Let's do a little group huddle.

14:43.192 --> 14:45.194
Please, always, communication.

14:45.298 --> 14:46.299
Appetizers, appetizers.

14:46.402 --> 14:47.403
Communicate.

14:47.507 --> 14:48.646
I'm going to talk
you guys through this.

14:48.749 --> 14:50.234
I'm never going to leave
you alone, all right?

14:50.337 --> 14:52.615
I'm gonna make sure you guys areOK the whole step of the way.

14:52.719 --> 14:54.963
I want you supporting him.

14:55.066 --> 14:56.896
When I call the
meats, pull the meats,

14:56.999 --> 14:58.794
and then just help
him whenever possible.

14:58.898 --> 14:59.691
On three.

14:59.795 --> 15:00.589
18.

15:00.692 --> 15:01.624
One, two, three.

15:01.728 --> 15:02.522
18!

15:02.625 --> 15:03.419
Let's go.

15:03.523 --> 15:04.386
Let's do this.

15:04.489 --> 15:06.284
Mia, one final thing.

15:06.388 --> 15:08.252
Ariel-- let's go.

15:08.355 --> 15:10.979
Every night, when
we are ready, what's

15:11.082 --> 15:13.188
the one thing I do to Marino?

15:13.291 --> 15:14.637
Oh, tell him to
open Hell's Kitchen.

15:14.741 --> 15:15.880
- So can you do it together?- Yes.

15:15.984 --> 15:16.881
On the count of three.

15:16.985 --> 15:18.331
- On the count of three.

15:43.597 --> 15:44.598

15:46.980 --> 15:50.018
NARRATOR: Along with other VIPs.

16:00.925 --> 16:03.617

16:03.721 --> 16:05.067
Man, this is the joint.

16:05.171 --> 16:06.482
Look at this, man.

16:06.586 --> 16:08.208
OK, guys, listen up!

16:08.312 --> 16:10.762
Two risotto, one shrimp
scampi, one ceviche.

16:10.866 --> 16:12.281
- Yes, chef.
- Thank you.

16:12.385 --> 16:13.179
This is it.

16:13.282 --> 16:14.352
It's crunch time.

16:14.456 --> 16:16.976
I have to prove that I
have it in me to lead

16:17.079 --> 16:19.737
an entire kitchen,
and I feel like I'm

16:19.840 --> 16:22.671
going to surprise Chef Ramsaywith my performance tonight.

16:22.774 --> 16:23.568
How long?

16:23.672 --> 16:24.466
Two risotto.

16:24.569 --> 16:25.605
Shrimp ceviche.

16:25.708 --> 16:26.571
Six minutes.

16:26.675 --> 16:27.469
Heard that.

16:27.572 --> 16:28.884
Risotto working.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.127
Put Trev on apps--

16:30.230 --> 16:31.818
you know, I would have
went a different route.

16:31.921 --> 16:33.371
That was Mia's decision, but--

16:33.475 --> 16:34.821
you know, you don't
want to start off slow,

16:34.924 --> 16:36.029
because then it
could just slow down

16:36.133 --> 16:37.479
the whole service after that.

16:37.582 --> 16:38.514
Risotto, 30 seconds.

16:38.618 --> 16:39.895
OK.

16:39.999 --> 16:40.792
30 seconds.

16:40.896 --> 16:41.862
Are you tasting it?

16:41.966 --> 16:43.416
Yes, I'm tasting everything.

16:47.247 --> 16:48.041
More salt.

16:48.145 --> 16:49.042
More salt. Heard, chef.

16:49.146 --> 16:49.939
Mhm.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.079
Season every stage.

16:51.182 --> 16:52.011
Every stage.

16:52.114 --> 16:52.908
Yes, chef.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.530
Mia on it, man.

16:54.634 --> 16:56.360
Trev, I don't need this, dude.

16:56.463 --> 16:57.292
Come on.

16:57.395 --> 16:59.294
Like, this is rookie shit.

16:59.397 --> 17:01.227
This needs to be perfect.

17:01.330 --> 17:02.090
Walking risotto.

17:09.476 --> 17:11.064
Good job.
Keep it coming, OK?

17:11.168 --> 17:12.134
- Got it.
- Good.

17:12.238 --> 17:13.722
Go.
Trev!

17:13.825 --> 17:14.619
Taste it.

17:14.723 --> 17:17.898
Tasting everything, chef.

17:18.002 --> 17:19.348
All right, listen
up, red team.

17:19.452 --> 17:20.556
You guys ready for this?
- Yes, chef.

17:20.660 --> 17:21.488
All right.

17:21.592 --> 17:22.627
We have a four top, away.

17:22.731 --> 17:24.319
Two scallops, two dumplings.

17:24.422 --> 17:25.389
Heard, chef!

17:25.492 --> 17:27.770
My team is amped
up, they are in this,

17:27.874 --> 17:29.807
and I feel like we're going tojust knock this out of the park

17:29.910 --> 17:30.808
tonight.

17:30.911 --> 17:32.775
Scotley, five
minutes all day, OK?

17:32.879 --> 17:33.880
Five minutes.
Heard.

17:33.983 --> 17:35.502
We only have one
shot at tonight,

17:35.606 --> 17:39.196
and we are determined
to have everything

17:39.299 --> 17:42.854
come out perfect for Ariel.

17:42.958 --> 17:43.752
Fuck, Motto.

17:43.855 --> 17:44.649
It burned.

17:44.753 --> 17:45.685
Huh?

17:45.788 --> 17:46.962
They burned.

17:47.066 --> 17:47.963
Shit.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.069
This is not going
according to plan.

17:50.172 --> 17:51.587
Kanae, get it together.

17:51.691 --> 17:53.002
You've got this, baby.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.970
I'll be walking twodumplings with two scallops.

17:55.074 --> 17:55.936
Yes.

17:56.040 --> 17:56.972
Right after--

17:57.076 --> 17:59.630
Walking scallops.

17:59.733 --> 18:00.527
Dumplings?

18:00.631 --> 18:01.908
Let's go.

18:02.011 --> 18:04.186
I need 30 seconds, chef,and it will be at the window.

18:04.290 --> 18:05.291
Ariel, I've got
scallops dying.

18:05.394 --> 18:06.395
We've got to go.

18:06.499 --> 18:08.397
We can't just leave
food hanging like that.

18:08.501 --> 18:09.605
This is your standard.

18:09.709 --> 18:10.986
All right, I need
those two dumplings.

18:11.090 --> 18:11.883
Let's go, guys.

18:11.987 --> 18:12.781
Yes, chef.

18:17.544 --> 18:19.891
I need service, please.

18:19.995 --> 18:21.134
Thank God.

18:21.238 --> 18:22.929
I didn't make all thesedamn dumplings for nothing.

18:23.032 --> 18:24.172
Rock that shit.

18:24.275 --> 18:26.588
NARRATOR: With Kanae's quickrecovery on dumplings--

18:26.691 --> 18:27.727

18:29.694 --> 18:31.040
NARRATOR: Appetizers

18:31.144 --> 18:32.835
their way out of both kitchens.

18:32.939 --> 18:33.733
Table 23.

18:33.836 --> 18:34.630
This is my family.

18:34.734 --> 18:35.873

18:35.976 --> 18:37.150

18:40.912 --> 18:42.155
Bon appetit.

18:42.259 --> 18:44.571
NARRATOR: And receivinghigh praise from the diners.

18:44.675 --> 18:45.986
Mm.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.541
That's phenomenal.

18:48.644 --> 18:49.542
Wow!

18:49.645 --> 18:50.474
Pretty damn good.

18:50.577 --> 18:51.475
It's pretty damn good.

18:51.578 --> 18:53.339
This risotto is
definitely off the hook.

18:53.442 --> 18:54.374
Fire.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.308
Two sea bass, two pork.

18:57.412 --> 18:58.275
How long, Roe?

18:58.378 --> 18:59.276
Seven minutes, please.

18:59.379 --> 19:00.449
Seven minutes to
the window, chef.

19:00.553 --> 19:01.588
Thank you.

19:01.692 --> 19:03.590
I'm one for one being
on winning brigades,

19:03.694 --> 19:05.523
so I think this
bodes well for Mia.

19:05.627 --> 19:06.938
Two fork in my hand.

19:07.042 --> 19:08.664
Let's go to the promised land.

19:08.768 --> 19:12.151
Fork, hot plate, chef.

19:12.254 --> 19:13.186
How long until sea bass?

19:13.290 --> 19:14.083
30 seconds.

19:17.328 --> 19:19.158
Come on.

19:19.261 --> 19:20.089
Roe!

19:20.193 --> 19:20.987
Glazing right now, bro.

19:21.090 --> 19:21.884
Glazing right now.

19:21.988 --> 19:23.092
I need you up here right now.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.680
She needs you to
look at that pork, Roe.

19:27.545 --> 19:28.926
Pork is raw, OK?

19:29.029 --> 19:29.823
I need you to flash them.

19:29.927 --> 19:30.962
Heard?

19:31.066 --> 19:31.929
How long?

19:32.964 --> 19:33.931
Two minutes.

19:34.034 --> 19:35.898
Here come the pork
medallions back.

19:36.002 --> 19:38.384
Roe, honey, they're thick.

19:38.487 --> 19:40.489
You need to mark themand get them in the oven,

19:40.593 --> 19:41.732
and let them finish.

19:41.835 --> 19:44.355
If not, you're going tosell medium rare pork again.

19:44.459 --> 19:46.426
And I highly doubt
anybody wants that.

19:46.530 --> 19:47.393
- Heather, come here.
- Yeah?

19:47.496 --> 19:48.532
Coming.

19:48.635 --> 19:50.292
Check that. if it's
not good, go back in.

19:50.396 --> 19:51.190
Why isn't it going?

19:51.293 --> 19:52.087
What are we waiting on?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.122
We're waiting on pork.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.054
Aw, shit.

19:54.158 --> 19:55.228
How long, pork?

19:55.332 --> 19:56.264
Just checking it now, chef.

19:56.367 --> 19:58.024
I don't want to give
you anything raw.

19:58.127 --> 20:00.026
Aw, man.

20:00.129 --> 20:01.269
This ain't good.

20:01.372 --> 20:03.305
What the fuck is going on?

20:03.409 --> 20:04.479
How long, pork?

20:04.582 --> 20:05.480
Uh-oh.

20:05.583 --> 20:06.377
Roe!

20:14.109 --> 20:16.594
NARRATOR: It's 45 minutes intothe final dinner service--

20:16.698 --> 20:17.906
Why isn't it going?
What are we waiting on?

20:18.009 --> 20:18.803
We're waiting on pork.

20:18.907 --> 20:19.804
Aw, shit.

20:19.908 --> 20:21.185
NARRATOR: And
rookie finalist Mia

20:21.289 --> 20:24.775
has been left waiting on Roe todeliver properly cooked pork.

20:24.878 --> 20:25.845
How long, pork?

20:25.948 --> 20:28.054
One minute on
those re-fires, Mia.

20:28.157 --> 20:31.471
I won the challenge, and Roewas my first pick last night.

20:31.575 --> 20:32.955
I thought she was the strongest.

20:33.059 --> 20:36.165
And this is a little
nerve-wracking.

20:37.166 --> 20:37.960
Super hot.

20:41.826 --> 20:43.621
It's done.

20:43.725 --> 20:44.829
Go, go, go.

20:44.933 --> 20:46.417
Man, it's a process to watch.

20:46.521 --> 20:48.350
It's scary.

20:48.454 --> 20:51.180
Very scary.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.596
Guys, listen up.

20:52.699 --> 20:55.944
First entrees-- we're going togo on two rib caps, two wagyu.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.048
How long?

20:57.152 --> 20:58.153
I need eight minutes, chef.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.050
Eight minutes.

20:59.154 --> 21:00.500
Two rip cap, two wagyu.

21:00.604 --> 21:01.570
Heard.

21:01.674 --> 21:03.054
I've never worked
with Scotley before,

21:03.158 --> 21:04.815
so I'm going to keep
an eye on him tonight.

21:04.918 --> 21:07.024
And the menu's a
little lighter tonight,

21:07.127 --> 21:10.096
so hopefully
Scotley can keep up.

21:10.199 --> 21:11.062
Oh, my god.

21:11.166 --> 21:12.098
Scotley!

21:12.201 --> 21:12.995
Right now, chef.

21:13.099 --> 21:14.169
Scotley, watch
your grill, man.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.239
Heard.

21:15.343 --> 21:16.758
We're charring on
our steaks over here.

21:16.861 --> 21:17.862
Heard.

21:17.966 --> 21:19.795
ARIEL: We want perfect
food tonight, OK?

21:19.899 --> 21:20.934
Not a race.

21:21.038 --> 21:23.074
It always gets
annoying when, you know,

21:23.178 --> 21:24.766
you have a backseat driver.

21:24.869 --> 21:27.078
Somebody over your shoulder,telling you how to cook.

21:27.182 --> 21:28.045
Man, I got this.

21:28.148 --> 21:29.218
I've been doing this.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.186
We've got to watch
the grill because we're

21:31.290 --> 21:32.946
getting too much char.

21:33.050 --> 21:36.156
I would like to start
a couple new ones.

21:36.260 --> 21:37.710
Yes, chef.

21:37.813 --> 21:38.987
Come on, man.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.954
I'm not concerned about
rushing these out.

21:41.058 --> 21:42.715
I want to make sure we getthem to the guests the way

21:42.818 --> 21:44.855
they're intended to be enjoyed.

21:44.958 --> 21:46.650
All right, I need to
see those rib caps.

21:46.753 --> 21:47.582
Bring 'em up.

21:47.685 --> 21:48.790
Bringing it right now, chef.

21:52.449 --> 21:53.622
That's perfectly cooked.

21:53.726 --> 21:54.761
Not more than this.

21:54.865 --> 21:55.762
Heard, chef.

21:55.866 --> 21:56.660
Trust me.

21:56.763 --> 21:58.247
I'm here to help you.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.077
I need service, please.

22:00.180 --> 22:02.976
Our chef seems
very self-assured.

22:03.080 --> 22:03.908
Yeah.

22:04.012 --> 22:04.978
All right, guys, next ticket.

22:05.082 --> 22:06.117
You said three minutes.

22:06.221 --> 22:07.360
You should be 30 seconds out.

22:07.464 --> 22:08.499
Let's go.

22:08.603 --> 22:11.088
OK, so away now, two
chicken, two churrasco.

22:11.191 --> 22:12.572
Two chicken, two beef.
Heard, chef.

22:12.676 --> 22:13.815
Two chicken, two churrasco.

22:13.918 --> 22:17.128
Guys, I need fiveminutes on that next check.

22:17.232 --> 22:19.855
The two skirt, and
the two chicken.

22:19.959 --> 22:21.961
I'm a little
nervous about Heather.

22:22.064 --> 22:24.619
She just lost to me,
so it may be a little

22:24.722 --> 22:26.103
difficult to motivate her.

22:26.206 --> 22:27.518
Nice sear, nice glaze.

22:27.622 --> 22:28.519
Medium rare.

22:28.623 --> 22:30.935
I just hope that
she can support me.

22:31.039 --> 22:31.867
How long?

22:31.971 --> 22:33.593
Two chicken, two churrasco.

22:33.697 --> 22:35.940
Give me three minutes onthe two beef and two chicken.

22:36.044 --> 22:37.356
Yeah?

22:37.459 --> 22:40.048
I'm all about carrying Mia tovictory, whether we're BFFs

22:40.151 --> 22:40.945
or not.

22:41.049 --> 22:41.946
Chicken and beef are up.

22:42.050 --> 22:43.223
Let me know when
you're ready to walk.

22:43.327 --> 22:44.328
You ready to go, Jose?

22:44.432 --> 22:45.812

22:48.297 --> 22:49.091
Behind chef.

22:49.195 --> 22:50.955
Hot.

22:51.059 --> 22:52.474
Are they rested?

22:52.578 --> 22:53.406
Yes, chef.

22:53.510 --> 22:55.443
Hopefully I lead
Mia into victory,

22:55.546 --> 22:58.653
because I know what it's liketo have my hand on that door

22:58.756 --> 22:59.757
and it not open.

22:59.861 --> 23:00.655
It hurts.

23:03.002 --> 23:04.313
- Heather.
- Yes?

23:04.417 --> 23:05.384
Beautiful cook on the protein.

23:05.487 --> 23:06.385

23:06.488 --> 23:07.524
Thank you.

23:07.627 --> 23:09.318
NARRATOR: With entrees
leaving Mia's kitchen

23:09.422 --> 23:10.803
at a steady pace--
- Keep it going, Mia.

23:10.906 --> 23:11.907
Keep it going.

23:12.011 --> 23:12.874
This meat is juicy and soft.

23:12.977 --> 23:14.116
Yeah.

23:14.220 --> 23:15.670
NARRATOR: Over in the redkitchen, veteran Ariel--

23:15.773 --> 23:16.740
Guys, next ticket.

23:16.843 --> 23:17.982

23:18.086 --> 23:19.294

NARRATOR: Is continuing topush Bret for perfection.

23:21.503 --> 23:23.332
Walking as soon as
garnish is up, chef.

23:23.436 --> 23:24.230
Thank you.

23:24.333 --> 23:25.645
Bret has a big responsibility.

23:25.749 --> 23:27.509
He has to cook two
proteins tonight,

23:27.613 --> 23:29.856
so I need to make
sure that he nurses

23:29.960 --> 23:34.413
and babysits that wagyu sothat it's absolutely perfect.

23:34.516 --> 23:35.448
Oh, boy.

23:35.552 --> 23:36.794
I wish I was in the
finale right now,

23:36.898 --> 23:38.002
considering I was so close.

23:38.106 --> 23:39.935
But Ariel, she's
a phenomenal chef,

23:40.039 --> 23:41.350
and she deserves this win bad.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.145
And I'm gonna do whateverI can to motherfucking help

23:43.249 --> 23:44.457
her get it.
- Chef behind.

23:44.561 --> 23:45.527
Chicken and wagyu.

23:45.631 --> 23:46.563
He told me he walked
up chicken garnish,

23:46.666 --> 23:47.909
followed by steak garnish.

23:48.012 --> 23:48.806
Fucking hell, really?

23:48.910 --> 23:49.738
It's cold.

23:49.842 --> 23:50.843
We're serving cold fucking food.

23:50.946 --> 23:51.982
I need a little heat on this.

23:52.085 --> 23:53.259
Be very careful.I don't want it overcooked.

23:53.362 --> 23:54.640
- Just touch it.
- Heard, chef.

23:54.743 --> 23:56.745
I know it's a wagyu, I getthat, but it's barely lukewarm.

23:56.849 --> 23:57.677
Yes, chef.

23:57.781 --> 23:59.023
Timing is way off!

23:59.127 --> 24:03.821
I feel bad whenever I fuckup a food, or it's not 100%

24:03.925 --> 24:05.236
flawless the first time.

24:05.340 --> 24:08.377
Whether it's for Ariel, chef,any customer, my clients--

24:08.481 --> 24:09.586
whatever.

24:09.689 --> 24:12.140
I bring passion every timeI step in that kitchen.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.244
Chef, right
behind to your left.

24:13.348 --> 24:14.729

24:41.341 --> 24:42.308
I'm not sharing this with you.

24:42.411 --> 24:43.792
This is too good.

24:43.896 --> 24:44.690
Wow, that's good.

24:44.793 --> 24:45.622
That is really good.

24:45.725 --> 24:46.519
Yeah?

24:46.623 --> 24:48.590
Very good job.

24:48.694 --> 24:49.764
Mm.

24:49.867 --> 24:50.799
Away now.

24:50.903 --> 24:52.663

Two sea bass, two--

24:53.906 --> 24:55.079

24:56.356 --> 24:57.496
Five minus.
Five minutes.

24:57.599 --> 24:58.324
Five.
You can do five?

24:58.427 --> 24:59.325
Five.

24:59.428 --> 25:00.844
Guys, this is the
last stretch, OK?

25:00.947 --> 25:02.121
Let's finish strong.

25:02.224 --> 25:03.743
I want you guys to nail it.

25:03.847 --> 25:07.333
We have a really good pacegoing, and it feels good,

25:07.436 --> 25:09.956
but I'm not
celebrating just yet.

25:10.060 --> 25:11.371
Two sea bass, two churrasco.

25:11.475 --> 25:12.269
How long?

25:12.372 --> 25:13.304
You ready?

25:13.408 --> 25:14.202
I can go.

25:14.305 --> 25:15.272
Do you need a minute?

25:15.375 --> 25:16.169
I think I'm good.

25:16.273 --> 25:17.101
OK.

25:17.205 --> 25:18.413
Chef, coming in to the right.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.310
Yep.

25:23.176 --> 25:24.177
How long on that sea bass?

25:24.281 --> 25:25.075
In my hands, chef.

25:25.178 --> 25:25.972
Walking.

25:28.492 --> 25:30.045
Is that the best
you can do, Roe?

25:30.149 --> 25:31.012
It's falling apart.

25:31.115 --> 25:31.944
Come on, guys.

25:32.047 --> 25:33.014
It's falling apart.

25:33.117 --> 25:34.394
Were you boiling
rapidly or steaming it?

25:34.498 --> 25:35.326
Steaming it, chef.

25:35.430 --> 25:36.569
It looks terrible.

25:36.673 --> 25:38.122
I always have thisproblem that the minute I

25:38.226 --> 25:41.367
go under on something, I, like,overcompensate on the next

25:41.470 --> 25:42.333
and go over.

25:42.437 --> 25:44.094
Refire everything, guys!

25:44.197 --> 25:46.303
Garnish, protein, everything.

25:46.406 --> 25:47.615
Heard.

25:47.718 --> 25:50.169
For some unknown reason,which I don't understand why,

25:50.272 --> 25:51.757
Roe was the first
pick last night.

25:51.860 --> 25:54.207
And I don't know if those arebig shoes to fill, or what,

25:54.311 --> 25:55.346
but she's dropping the ball.

25:55.450 --> 25:56.762
How long for table
four to come out

25:56.865 --> 25:57.694
with the main, more or less?

25:57.797 --> 25:58.833
We're re-firing it.
Everything.

25:58.936 --> 25:59.972
OK.
Perfect.

26:00.075 --> 26:01.387
So I'd rather be a
bit slower and perfect

26:01.490 --> 26:03.492
than send something thatshe's not happy with, right?

26:03.596 --> 26:04.286
OK.
It's perfect.

26:04.390 --> 26:05.425

For the love of God.

26:19.094 --> 26:20.130
You good, bro?

26:21.165 --> 26:21.959
Are you happy with that?

26:22.063 --> 26:23.133

It's really good.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.345
The temperature is perfect.

29:55.448 --> 29:56.622
It's amazing, right?

29:56.725 --> 29:59.556
It melts in your mouth.

29:59.659 --> 30:01.213
This is one [inaudible].

30:01.316 --> 30:02.283
The detail and
the presentation

30:02.386 --> 30:04.147
really goes a long way.

30:04.250 --> 30:05.182
Ladies, how is everything?

You have to be.

30:12.603 --> 30:13.570
- You gotta be a general.- It gets busy, yes.

30:13.673 --> 30:15.123
The hustle is on point.

30:15.227 --> 30:16.262
- Thank you.

You guys did a great job.

30:20.542 --> 30:21.854
I love you, too, man.

30:21.958 --> 30:23.476
I'm so glad service is over.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.927
I hope Chef Ramsay saw
a true leader tonight.

30:26.031 --> 30:28.654
A captain, and someone
that he can trust.

30:28.757 --> 30:31.036
Oh, you were so good.

30:31.139 --> 30:32.416
It was so amazing.

30:32.520 --> 30:33.728
Thank you.
Thank you.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.694
Hey, I liked that mackerel.

30:34.798 --> 30:35.937
It was pretty good.

30:36.041 --> 30:37.456
Do you think you can fixthat for me some other time?

30:37.559 --> 30:38.491
Holy mackerel.

30:38.595 --> 30:39.389
Huh?

30:39.492 --> 30:40.839
Thank you guys so much.

30:40.942 --> 30:42.047
Amazing work, everybody.

30:42.150 --> 30:43.013
Amazing work.

30:43.117 --> 30:44.325
Thank you.

30:44.428 --> 30:48.122
We had a few bumps, but I'mhappy and proud of myself.

30:48.225 --> 30:50.262
I left all of it in the kitchen.

30:50.365 --> 30:51.608
Thank you so much.

30:51.711 --> 30:53.644
I gave everything I had.

31:09.074 --> 31:10.006
I tried to do my best.

31:10.109 --> 31:10.938
You did a great job.

31:11.041 --> 31:12.180
You did a really,
really nice job.

31:12.284 --> 31:13.630
Thank you.

31:13.733 --> 31:15.804
I feel like it's going to be avery, very close call tonight.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.461
I have no hard
feelings against Mia,

31:17.565 --> 31:20.119
but I really hope
that Ariel wins today.

31:20.223 --> 31:21.327
Seriously.

31:21.431 --> 31:22.742
Thank you for your work, Jose.It means so much.

31:22.846 --> 31:23.674
- Mia.
- Thank you so much.

31:23.778 --> 31:24.641
I told you, I got you.

31:24.744 --> 31:25.884
I'm proud of Mia.

31:25.987 --> 31:28.058
Coming in as a rookie andproving to the veterans

31:28.162 --> 31:30.958
that, you know, we were strongerthan what they imagined.

31:31.061 --> 31:33.408
Definitely feel likeMia's taking this W home.

31:36.549 --> 31:37.861
Dinner service was great.

31:37.965 --> 31:41.623
It's over now, and thisis when the nerves really

31:41.727 --> 31:43.315
kick in, because
there's absolutely

31:43.418 --> 31:45.317
nothing I can do anymore.

31:45.420 --> 31:46.870
- Amazing job, both of you.- Thank you.

31:46.974 --> 31:48.182
Thank you.
Thank you for your work.

31:48.285 --> 31:49.459
May the best lady win.

31:49.562 --> 31:50.978
Congratulations to
the both of you.

31:51.081 --> 31:52.980
I'm proud of my team.

31:53.083 --> 31:54.533
They did an amazing job.

31:54.636 --> 31:56.190
I couldn't have asked
for a better team.

31:56.293 --> 31:57.846
I'm just anxious now.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.676
I can't sit down right now.

31:59.779 --> 32:00.815
I'm wired right now.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.265
I'm fucking wired.

32:02.368 --> 32:04.888
I feel relief because wegot through the final dinner

32:04.992 --> 32:06.200
service.

32:06.303 --> 32:08.961
I think it went pretty well,and I'm just moments away

32:09.065 --> 32:11.412
from finding out whether
or not I've won or not,

32:11.515 --> 32:13.552
which is giving me
total anxiety job.

32:13.655 --> 32:14.794
- Good job.
- Good job.

32:14.898 --> 32:16.279
I'm trying to just keepit together for a minute.

32:16.382 --> 32:17.211
- You'll be OK.
- I'm good.

32:20.386 --> 32:21.732
Would anybody
like some ice cream?

32:21.836 --> 32:22.837
No, you're good.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.115
I was like, that's my dog.

32:25.219 --> 32:27.221
Time to get serious.

32:27.324 --> 32:28.187
[inaudible].

32:28.291 --> 32:29.119
[knocking on door]

32:29.223 --> 32:31.018
[gasp]

32:32.778 --> 32:34.780
Chef Ramsay, what
are you doing here?

32:42.753 --> 32:44.134
Time to get serious.

32:44.238 --> 32:45.618
[knocking on door]

32:46.688 --> 32:49.968
So this is where you live?

32:50.071 --> 32:50.865
- Yes.
- Right.

32:50.969 --> 32:51.762
Look.

32:51.866 --> 32:52.971
Behind you.

32:53.074 --> 32:54.144
Oh, my god.

32:54.248 --> 32:55.628
You want to look at
this all the time?

32:55.732 --> 32:57.320
Yeah.

32:57.423 --> 32:59.287
I'm not one for
apologizing, but I

32:59.391 --> 33:02.221
am sorry about that
fucking mess on there.

33:02.325 --> 33:03.947
Was't trying to be--

33:04.051 --> 33:07.192
First of all, let me tellour returning chefs how much I

33:07.295 --> 33:10.022
appreciate the effort
that you all put

33:10.126 --> 33:12.783
in across tonight's service.

33:12.887 --> 33:15.165
Not only did you
support your chefs,

33:15.269 --> 33:17.823
but you guys had a good service.

33:18.824 --> 33:19.928
Thank you, chef.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.758
Even after, you
know, being eliminated,

33:21.861 --> 33:23.139
I will bleed for Chef Ramsay.

33:23.242 --> 33:24.036
That's the hierarchy.

33:24.140 --> 33:25.210
That's your mentor.

33:25.313 --> 33:26.452
We've got a lot
more things to do,

33:26.556 --> 33:27.971
and I am miles away
from being ready.

33:28.075 --> 33:30.318
But for now, I'd
like both of you

33:30.422 --> 33:31.871
to say goodbye to your brigades.

33:31.975 --> 33:33.287
- Bye, guys.
- Buy, guys.

33:33.390 --> 33:34.564
- And your sous chefs.
- Bye, guys.

33:34.667 --> 33:35.461
See you in a little bit.

33:35.565 --> 33:36.497
Yep.

33:36.600 --> 33:37.774
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33:37.877 --> 33:38.947
Thank you so much for tonight.

33:40.397 --> 33:41.916
Guys, head into
the dining room.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.124
I'll see you there shortly.

33:43.228 --> 33:44.022
Hell yeah.

33:44.125 --> 33:44.919
Let's do it.

33:56.137 --> 33:57.518
Scallops are
cooked beautifully.

33:57.621 --> 33:58.726
I love what you did
with the celery.

33:58.829 --> 34:00.452
You've done something
pretty magical.

34:00.555 --> 34:01.315
Thank you, chef.

34:01.418 --> 34:02.247
Good job.

34:02.350 --> 34:03.213
Just look at that.

34:03.317 --> 34:04.111
Textbook.

34:04.214 --> 34:05.215
Thank you, chef.

34:05.319 --> 34:08.011
First recipients
of the black jacket.

34:08.115 --> 34:09.875
Congratulations, Ariel.

34:09.978 --> 34:11.256
- Thank you, chef.
- Great job.

34:11.359 --> 34:12.395
Good job, Ariel.

34:12.498 --> 34:13.465
Why do I have tuna?

34:13.568 --> 34:15.743
I need two beef tartare,
not tuna tartare.

34:15.846 --> 34:16.640
Look at me.

34:16.744 --> 34:17.538
Well spotted.

34:20.610 --> 34:21.749
It's amazing.

34:21.852 --> 34:23.061
I'm gonna get to the endthere, and I want more.

34:23.164 --> 34:24.683
- Yes.
- Awesome.

34:24.786 --> 34:26.926
You did a really nice jobon the steaming of this fish.

34:27.030 --> 34:27.824
Wow.

34:27.927 --> 34:28.928
I'll take the rest to go.

34:29.032 --> 34:30.723
This is a delicious dish.

34:30.827 --> 34:33.450
It is worthy of being on a menuright now, in a restaurant.

34:33.554 --> 34:34.348
Peanut butter.

34:34.451 --> 34:36.108
Yes!

34:36.212 --> 34:37.316
Nice work, Mia.

34:37.420 --> 34:38.490
Four for four.

34:38.593 --> 34:39.732
It doesn't look like lobster.

34:39.836 --> 34:41.113
You're absolutely right.Well spotted.

34:41.217 --> 34:42.010
It is monkfish.

34:42.114 --> 34:42.908
Yes, chef.

34:46.187 --> 34:47.326
This is it, girl.

34:47.430 --> 34:49.501
Yeah.

34:49.604 --> 34:50.847
This is bananas.

34:50.950 --> 34:53.056
I'm having, like, an out ofbody experience right now.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.022
Yeah.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.162
I said in the
beginning, I thought

34:55.265 --> 34:56.922
Mia was my biggest competition.

34:57.025 --> 34:59.131
And I think that sheovercame a lot of hurdles,

34:59.235 --> 35:01.513
but I think based
on my performance

35:01.616 --> 35:03.377
that I won "Hell's Kitchen."

35:03.480 --> 35:04.964
Let's get this over with.

35:05.068 --> 35:06.552
I'm going to beat
Ariel because I

35:06.656 --> 35:08.727
feel like we're
at the same level

35:08.830 --> 35:10.418
as far as leadership goes.

35:10.522 --> 35:14.215
I feel like my dishes
are more creative,

35:14.319 --> 35:17.529
so I definitely think
I'm the next executive

35:17.632 --> 35:20.221
chef at the flagshipHell's Kitchen Restaurant

35:20.325 --> 35:21.498
in Las Vegas.

35:21.602 --> 35:22.430
[phone ringing]

35:22.534 --> 35:23.328
Scared me.

35:23.431 --> 35:25.123
[phone ringing]

35:26.020 --> 35:26.814
Hi, this is Mia.

35:26.917 --> 35:27.711
Hi, Mia.

35:27.815 --> 35:28.988
I've made my decision.

35:29.092 --> 35:31.577
Can you and Ariel pleasemake your way to my office?

35:31.681 --> 35:32.475
Yes, chef.

35:32.578 --> 35:34.718
Thank you.

35:34.822 --> 35:38.722
He said make our
way to his office.

35:38.826 --> 35:39.620
This is it, girl.

35:44.176 --> 35:46.523
[applause]

36:04.403 --> 36:05.266
Good luck, Mia!

36:10.754 --> 36:11.583
GORDON RAMSAY: Right.

36:11.686 --> 36:13.101
You two, welcome.

36:13.205 --> 36:18.762
Ariel, Mia, this has been anextremely difficult decision.

36:18.866 --> 36:20.143
Let me tell you.

36:20.247 --> 36:22.973
Mia, never before have wehad a chef that has performed

36:23.077 --> 36:26.184
so strongly across challenges.

36:26.287 --> 36:28.772
Above that, you've been one ofthe most creative chefs we've

36:28.876 --> 36:30.395
ever had in Hell's Kitchen.

36:30.498 --> 36:32.086
Thank you, chef.

36:32.190 --> 36:32.983
Ariel?

36:33.087 --> 36:34.330
Yes, chef?

36:34.433 --> 36:37.540
You have been the
most consistent chef

36:37.643 --> 36:42.061
across this entire competition,so it's no surprise to me

36:42.165 --> 36:46.480
that you are the only
chef on either team

36:46.583 --> 36:50.208
never to be considered
for elimination.

36:50.311 --> 36:54.004
Ariel, right now,
how are you feeling?

36:54.108 --> 36:57.284
My stomach is in knots,chef, to be honest with you.

36:57.387 --> 37:00.252
I'm just trying to containmyself, and maintain my--

37:00.356 --> 37:02.565
my calm that I've
had all season.

37:02.668 --> 37:04.912
Mia, what's going
through your mind?

37:05.015 --> 37:07.915
My heart is racing, butI'm just so proud of what

37:08.018 --> 37:09.330
I've accomplished.

37:09.434 --> 37:12.126
And I'm really proud of myself,and I'm so grateful for all

37:12.230 --> 37:13.714
the faith you've had in me.

37:13.817 --> 37:16.958
I could not be prouder
of the two of you.

37:17.062 --> 37:18.926
In my eyes, you're both winners.

37:19.927 --> 37:21.169
Thank you, chef.

37:21.273 --> 37:25.588
Mia and Ariel, please stepup in front of your doors.

37:25.691 --> 37:26.520
Yes, chef.

37:34.769 --> 37:37.462
For me, everything
is on the line.

37:37.565 --> 37:38.497
