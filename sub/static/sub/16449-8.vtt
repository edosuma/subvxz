WEBVTT

00:07.633 --> 00:09.509
Eleanor? Come on in.

00:11.345 --> 00:15.014
Well, not often you get to confront
your greatest failure face to face.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.474
Good to see you too, bud.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.809
I am just dumbfounded
as to how this happened.

00:19.311 --> 00:22.480
Our system has never made
a mistake before.

00:22.606 --> 00:23.564
It's just not possible.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.107
And yet, here we are.

00:26.318 --> 00:27.401
First things first.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.156
Who are you?
- Well, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.158
And some of the info you had
was right.

00:34.493 --> 00:37.328
I mean, "flattened by a boner pill truck

00:37.621 --> 00:40.414
after dropping margarita mix
in grocery store parking lot"

00:40.499 --> 00:41.916
that's a very "me" way to die.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.460
But all the other info was wrong.

00:45.087 --> 00:48.005
In my defence,
when I first arrived and you said

00:48.131 --> 00:50.675
"You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead,
and you're in the Good Place"

00:50.801 --> 00:53.761
I had no reason to think
that was a mistake.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.099
Location and date of birth, please?

00:58.600 --> 01:01.477
Phoenix, Arizona. October 14th, 1986.

01:02.437 --> 01:05.565
So, sorry, that's what I used to tell
people when I lied about my age.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.068
I was born in 1982.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.779
You lied so much you forgot
your own birthdate.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.781
Not a great start.

01:14.241 --> 01:17.118
But it should be enough
for Janet to locate your file.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.828
Janet?

01:20.122 --> 01:23.541
Janet?
- What's that? What's that?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.126
What's this?

01:26.962 --> 01:29.046
Her memory's still being rebooted because

01:29.464 --> 01:30.881
oh, you know
someone murdered her.

01:31.883 --> 01:35.052
Janet, could you please locate
the file for an Eleanor Shellstrop

01:35.137 --> 01:38.097
born in 1982.
- Yes.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.266
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.351
Sure! Anything else?

01:43.478 --> 01:45.813
No, Janet, this is actually a cactus.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.901
- This might take a while.
- Wee!

02:03.081 --> 02:07.293
Since Janet can't retrieve your file,
I need to find another way

02:07.502 --> 02:09.503
to determine
what kind of person you were.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.715
This is a quick litmus test.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.467
A handful of questions

02:14.676 --> 02:17.928
designed to tell whether you were
fundamentally good or bad.

02:18.347 --> 02:19.388
Question number one.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.391
Did you ever wrongfully slaughter
your kinsman's yak?

02:24.895 --> 02:28.230
Oh, sorry. This is the nomadic
Mongolian edition.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.984
I need to grab the North American.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.277
Yep, here we go.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.907
Question number one.
Did you ever commit a serious crime

02:38.241 --> 02:40.576
such as murder, sexual harassment

02:40.911 --> 02:43.120
arson, or otherwise?
- No.

02:45.499 --> 02:50.294
Did you ever have a vanity license plate
like "Mama's BMW," "Lexus4Liz"

02:50.462 --> 02:52.463
or "Boobguy?"
- No.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.091
Did you ever reheat fish
in an office microwave?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.426
Ew... No.
- Have you ever paid money

02:57.511 --> 03:00.304
to hear music performed by California
funk rock band

03:00.389 --> 03:01.681
"The Red Hot Chili Peppers?"

03:01.932 --> 03:04.225
No.
- Where you ever a waiter

03:04.518 --> 03:08.479
and when seeing a customer
who had eaten all his or her food

03:08.897 --> 03:12.024
you said sarcastically,
"I guess you hated it?"

03:12.234 --> 03:14.902
No.
- Michael: Have you ever used the word hubby?

03:15.153 --> 03:18.322
Or referred to the department store
Target as "Tarjay"?

03:18.407 --> 03:19.448
No.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.953
Did you ever take off your shoes
and socks on a commercial airline?

03:23.995 --> 03:26.747
And socks? Ew. Who would do that?

03:27.958 --> 03:31.293
People who go to the Bad Place,
Eleanor, that's the point.

03:31.628 --> 03:35.464
The Bad Place is every bit
as awful as the Good Place is good.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.718
And unless I can figure out
a compelling reason to keep you here

03:39.136 --> 03:40.761
you will spend eternity

03:41.096 --> 03:44.890
with murderers and arsonists,
and people who take off their shoes

03:45.142 --> 03:47.601
and socks on commercial airlines.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.522
Janet, can I have a glass
of water, please?

03:51.815 --> 03:53.941
Here you go!

03:54.359 --> 03:56.527
Oh, gosh! You said "water"?

03:56.820 --> 03:59.363
Yeah.
- I'm so sorry. There you go.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.288
I really do have sympathy
for your situation.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.082
I mean, you thought your soulmate
was a good person

04:10.208 --> 04:12.501
and then you learned
that she's just an immoral grifter.

04:12.586 --> 04:16.464
Tahani, please.
- Am I wrong? She lied to everyone.

04:16.715 --> 04:19.675
She caused a giant sinkhole,
into which poor Glenn fell.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.469
She caused a trash storm. She...

04:22.053 --> 04:24.054
Well, she pretended to be my friend

04:24.598 --> 04:25.931
when I really needed one.

04:26.308 --> 04:29.393
And lest we forget, she murdered Janet!

04:29.853 --> 04:31.979
As far as I'm concerned,
the sooner she's gone

04:32.022 --> 04:33.272
the better off we'll all be.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.858
I... I understand that Eleanor
violated our trust.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.276
But please

04:37.319 --> 04:38.444
when you're talking to Michael

04:38.528 --> 04:40.863
try to think about
what she's had to go through.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.868
All right. I will, for you.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.287
But we've been through
a lot as well.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.456
You know, I haven't been
this upset since my good friend Taylor

04:50.540 --> 04:52.249
was rudely upstaged
by my other friend Kanye

04:52.334 --> 04:54.460
who was defending
my best friend BeyoncÃ©.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.172
And finally, a multi-part question.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.258
Did you ever appear on
the American television programme

05:01.343 --> 05:03.677
"The Bachelor,"
or its companion shows

05:03.804 --> 05:06.263
"The Bachelorette"
and "Bachelor in Paradise"

05:06.389 --> 05:08.682
or work on them in any capacity

05:09.184 --> 05:13.103
or post on any social media site
that you were

05:13.522 --> 05:17.399
emotionally invested in
any of the "relationships"

05:17.526 --> 05:19.860
the contestants were pursuing?
- No.

05:20.529 --> 05:25.324
OK! You did very well
on the questionnaire, Eleanor.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.492
So far, so good.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.452
Michael? Good news.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.996
I was able to obtain
Eleanor Shellstrop's file.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.457
Would you like to see it?
- Yes, Janet, I would.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.626
But, first...

05:36.294 --> 05:37.586
Is it actually a cactus?

05:37.796 --> 05:38.838
I don't understand.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.590
I want to see the file
for Eleanor Shellstrop.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.510
Is that what you have?
Or do you have a cactus?

05:44.719 --> 05:45.886
I have the file.
- You're sure.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.931
You have the file, and not a cactus.
- That is correct.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.309
I have Eleanor Shellstrop's file.
I do not have a cactus.

05:53.061 --> 05:56.105
Excellent. Please give me the file.
- Here you go!

05:57.440 --> 05:58.607
Thank you, Janet.
- You're welcome!

06:00.318 --> 06:02.278
Well, I say we call it a day.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.154
I mean, I nailed the questionnaire

06:04.322 --> 06:06.323
and you're swimming in cacti.

06:06.783 --> 06:10.870
Can't we just chalk this up
to a hilarious mistake, and move on?

06:10.996 --> 06:12.746
No, we can't, Eleanor.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.875
There's no such thing as a mistake,
in this realm.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.294
And yet you are, somehow,
a mistake.

06:18.628 --> 06:23.048
I mean you're a giant chunk
of spinach in the teeth of the universe.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.183
I need to understand every facet
of this disaster.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.394
Tell me a lie about yourself.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.856
Any lie.
- I love the opera.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.152
And now a truth.
- I love women's MMA.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.779
We don't like to use this.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.365
We've never really had a call for it,
before you.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.951
But in the interest of time,
Eleanor...

06:51.828 --> 06:53.495
Did you murder Janet?

06:54.080 --> 06:56.582
No, I did not.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.127
Do you know who did?
- Yes.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.006
Will you tell me who it was?
- No.

07:05.675 --> 07:10.262
I assume it was one of your friends,
and I admire you for protecting him or her.

07:10.555 --> 07:14.558
But, Eleanor, in the Good Place,
there's no room for bad people

07:14.726 --> 07:18.479
or bad actions,
so anyone involved in the murder of Janet

07:18.647 --> 07:20.814
will be reviewed and judged.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.525
And there will be consequences.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.155
Tahani? Come on in.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.365
Chidi.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.786
Imposter who soiled
our paradise with her moral turpitude.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.329
What's up?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.414
Thank you for confessing.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.374
I don't know what I would
have done

07:38.416 --> 07:39.667
if you hadn't.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm amazing.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.795
Bad news.
Michael knows I didn't kill Janet

07:42.963 --> 07:46.298
which means it's only a matter of time
before he finds out that you did.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.884
And that you did it
because you were trying to stop

07:48.969 --> 07:50.928
Bonehead Jones over here.
- Hey, homies!

07:51.179 --> 07:53.138
Then he'll figure out
that Jianyu's also a phony

07:53.431 --> 07:56.141
and here's the real dongbuster

07:56.393 --> 08:00.521
Michael said anybody who did anything
bad might have to go...

08:01.314 --> 08:03.107
Oh!
- Which means Jianyu's gone

08:03.191 --> 08:04.149
you might be gone

08:04.317 --> 08:06.527
and all three of us are
royally forking forked.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.404
So now I might get sent to the Bad Place?

08:09.781 --> 08:11.907
This is terrible!
What am I supposed to do if he asks me?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.410
I don't know. Kant would say...

08:15.036 --> 08:17.413
that lying in any scenario is wrong

08:17.497 --> 08:20.958
so if Michael asks if you killed Janet,
you should say "yes".

08:21.209 --> 08:24.545
On the other hand,
snitches do get stitches.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.296
That is true.
I read that once

08:26.381 --> 08:28.298
on the back of my boy Peanut's tricep.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.426
And you just casually cited
Immanuel Kant.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.845
I mean I know we're in a miserable
bind here, but

08:33.555 --> 08:35.014
this might be
the proudest day of my life.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.599
No offense,
but that's a real bummer of a life.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.354
Tahani. I'll get right to the crux
of the matter.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.399
Did you murder Janet?
- Absolutely not!

08:47.944 --> 08:50.112
Now you've spent a lot of time
with Eleanor.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.572
Why do you think that is?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.699
Well, people are just drawn to me.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.244
You know, one of my shyest friends,
I won't say his name to preserve his privacy

08:57.328 --> 08:59.455
but he found my presence
so comforting

08:59.539 --> 09:02.666
that he asked me to co-host
his TV show, "Anderson Cooper 360".

09:02.709 --> 09:05.711
Given what you learned about Eleanor

09:06.087 --> 09:08.172
do you think she deserves to be here?

09:10.508 --> 09:11.550
Well...

09:13.136 --> 09:16.847
You know if it were up to me,
I might find a way to look past her, um...

09:18.224 --> 09:19.266
deficiencies.

09:19.642 --> 09:20.976
But it's not up to me, is it?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.479
There are some criteria
that she unfortunately just

09:23.563 --> 09:24.938
didn't meet in her time on Earth.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.066
So you think that
I should send her to the Bad Place?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.859
Well, I didn't say that.

09:29.194 --> 09:32.905
But is her staying here unfair
to those who earned their place?

09:33.239 --> 09:35.115
It sounds like you want her to leave.

09:35.366 --> 09:40.954
Well, is it not she who wants us
to leave her?

09:42.040 --> 09:44.374
Thank you, Tahani, you've been a big help.

09:46.461 --> 09:47.544
Listen up, genius.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.129
He's gonna call you in there,
in a second.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.589
Don't worry, I got you.

09:50.673 --> 09:54.218
I'll just tell Michael you're the bomb
and that you got a dope soul an hella ethics.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.845
And he'll be all, "thanks, Jianyu".

09:57.013 --> 09:59.223
"You just freaked my being for real".

09:59.599 --> 10:01.809
Oh, boy. No.
Don't say any of that.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.977
Michael has a lie detector in there.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.604
It's, uh... it's a glowing cube.

10:05.814 --> 10:06.814
Like the All-Spark?

10:07.398 --> 10:08.857
From Transformers?
- Sure.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.151
Uh, just like the All-Spark,
from Transformers and...

10:11.236 --> 10:13.862
and he'll know instantly
if you're lying about anything, so...

10:14.239 --> 10:16.657
only "smiles and nods," got it?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.495
Jianyu, come on in.

10:30.547 --> 10:34.508
Wise, sage, centered Jianyu.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.679
I seek your wisdom
in this moment of crisis.

10:40.223 --> 10:43.058
What to do with Eleanor?
Should I let her stay?

10:44.018 --> 10:45.602
Should I send her away?

10:46.938 --> 10:49.815
You think I should send her away?

10:50.692 --> 10:53.360
No, I should let her stay?

10:53.611 --> 10:58.031
Or "No, I shouldn't let her stay,
because she doesn't belong here?"

10:58.449 --> 11:01.785
Or, "no, I shouldn't let her stay,
even though she does belong here?"

11:03.204 --> 11:06.331
Oh, Jianyu, I wish I had your wisdom.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.711
Your devotion to the noble truths
has given you something that I don't have -

11:10.753 --> 11:11.795
clarity.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.881
It was Buddha who said

11:15.049 --> 11:18.760
"If a man lives a pure life,
nothing can destroy him."

11:19.429 --> 11:20.470
I'm not a man

11:20.638 --> 11:22.222
and I've lived no "life"

11:23.349 --> 11:24.933
so will this destroy me?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.226
Ouch!

11:29.314 --> 11:31.648
Oh, of course.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.527
A cactus on its own intends no harm

11:35.612 --> 11:38.989
it's only when we interfere
that it becomes dangerous.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.450
I need to remember
my own agency here.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.245
Oh, thank you, Jianyu.

11:45.663 --> 11:46.705
You're free to go.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.751
Oh. Yes, of course, help yourself.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.461
I've got plenty of those.

11:56.883 --> 11:57.925
Chidi? Come on in.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.677
Hi there! I have Eleanor's file.

12:00.803 --> 12:04.681
Janet, if you hand me a cactus
I swear I will lose my mind.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.602
Oh! Yes! All right!
Here we go.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.271
Eleanor, come back in.
Chidi, you stay here.

12:13.399 --> 12:19.029
This file contains a list
of every good and bad thing you ever did.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.824
It's your entire life told through
a compendium of all of your actions.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.869
Nope.
It's a picture of a cactus...

12:26.371 --> 12:30.374
dozens and dozens and dozens
of pictures of the same cactus.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.378
Oh, no, wait. Here we go.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.713
Well, it's incomplete but...

12:37.382 --> 12:41.969
there appear to be some references
to the highest impact events from your life.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.972
That's the, uh... biggest positive
and negative point swings.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.766
So, "Little Julie?"
Now who's that?

12:48.017 --> 12:49.226
Julie is my cousin's daughter.

12:49.352 --> 12:53.939
Her mom is kind of a mess,
so I used to take her to the mall sometimes

12:53.982 --> 12:55.524
and bought her churro dogs.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.403
It's a hot dog,
but the bun is two churros

13:00.071 --> 13:02.489
and it's tied together
with a Slim Jim.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.951
It's an Arizona delicacy.
- Oh, sounds awful

13:06.160 --> 13:08.495
but it's very nice
that you made that girl happy.

13:09.872 --> 13:10.998
So. What's this?

13:11.082 --> 13:12.124
Cool Thredz

13:12.375 --> 13:15.627
Glendale Arizona's
Premiere T-shirt Emporium?"

13:15.712 --> 13:18.630
Uh... can we skip around and...
and circle back?

13:18.756 --> 13:20.549
How about I tell you more
about those churro dogs?

13:20.925 --> 13:24.261
They came with unlimited ranch dressing.
- Let's hear about the T-shirts, please.

13:25.930 --> 13:30.058
Okay. I'll tell you, and I'm going to be
one hundred percent honest.

13:30.727 --> 13:35.105
But it doesn't make me look
great so don't judge me.

13:35.690 --> 13:39.067
That's literally the purpose
of this entire exercise.

13:43.323 --> 13:47.576
Okay. To understand this, you have to know
about my roommate, Madison.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.454
- She was terrible.
- Hey, Mads?

13:50.830 --> 13:53.123
Um, I have to go to
this stupid work party tonight.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.875
Can I borrow your peach dress?

13:55.084 --> 13:57.252
Ooh, it's a hard no, babe.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.087
That dress is like twice your salary.

13:59.756 --> 14:03.258
And I gotta go to the DMV
and pick up my vanity plates. Ciao, bitches!

14:25.198 --> 14:26.865
Well, that's... that's not great.

14:27.742 --> 14:30.243
But I assume you confessed,
and paid to fix it?

14:30.411 --> 14:31.453
Not exactly.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.664
Hey, losers, I'm going out.
Can you zip me?

14:35.458 --> 14:37.084
Dude, that dress is hella ripped.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.794
What?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.713
Ugh! That stupid dry cleaner!

14:42.006 --> 14:44.800
Well, that's the risk you take
when you keep your clothes clean.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.636
My mom's a lawyer.
Those asswipes are gonna pay.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.347
She sued for nine hundred dollars,
for the dress

14:50.681 --> 14:53.433
and eighty million dollars
in emotional distress.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.061
The legal fees drove the dry cleaner
out of business.

14:56.145 --> 15:01.400
Oh, boy. Wait, this story is
about T-shirts.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.527
There's more, isn't there?

15:04.278 --> 15:05.320
A little.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.030
Check this out.

15:07.198 --> 15:10.367
Somebody put the dry cleaner's story
online and it went viral.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.868
Madison's famous.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.038
The "Dress Bitch"? Yikes.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.165
Serves her right.
Madison is psycho.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.667
She totally overreacted.

15:19.043 --> 15:23.004
This is her fault.
- Yeah. Her fault. That works.

15:23.798 --> 15:26.508
You guys, what is happening?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.552
Someone egged my Lexus!

15:28.761 --> 15:31.680
And I have like forty thousand
tweets calling me the "Dress Bitch"!

15:31.931 --> 15:33.849
Over a loser dry cleaner man?

15:34.100 --> 15:36.059
Why is everyone so jealous of me?

15:36.769 --> 15:39.646
This is a trash city full of idiots!

15:43.234 --> 15:45.485
The "Dress Bitch" is so catchy.
- Yeah.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.112
I mean someone could totally
make T-shirts.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.364
Oh!

15:49.449 --> 15:50.991
No, no, no, no.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.537
Do not tell me that
you made T-shirts that said that

15:55.580 --> 15:57.664
and then sold them for a profit.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.541
I wish I could tell you that, bud.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.334
I really do.

16:02.003 --> 16:05.088
Girl, check it out!
They're here!

16:06.757 --> 16:08.925
Wait a second.
Is this insane?

16:09.177 --> 16:10.385
I mean should we be doing this?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.471
Dude! Madison brought this on herself,
okay.

16:12.555 --> 16:15.682
She's a nightmare of a person,
to everybody.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.851
Plus we already have a ton of pre-orders.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.479
Here is your first cut of the profits!

16:20.855 --> 16:22.230
Holy mama!

16:24.066 --> 16:25.734
I can't believe you sold the T-shirts.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.528
Does it help if they basically
sold themselves?

16:28.863 --> 16:30.322
I think you know it does not.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.741
What did you do with the money?

16:33.201 --> 16:35.577
I was hoping you wouldn't ask me that.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.042
Thanks, babe!

16:46.297 --> 16:47.339
Next question!

16:48.466 --> 16:49.758
Eleanor.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.721
Given what you know about the people
who've been brought here

16:55.139 --> 16:56.640
the lives they've lead.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.643
Do you think you belong in the Good Place?

17:01.187 --> 17:03.980
No. I don't.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.782
<i>Hello? Bad Place. What's up, idiot?</i>

17:13.866 --> 17:17.661
Hello. This is Michael, the Architect
from Neighbourhood one-two...

17:17.745 --> 17:20.580
<i>Psyche! We're not here right now,
so leave a message after the beep.</i>

17:20.748 --> 17:23.041
I hate calling these guys.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.211
Hello, uh... this is Michael

17:26.295 --> 17:29.256
the Architect from Neighbourho--
<i>- Double psyche! We are here.</i>

17:29.298 --> 17:30.173
<i>Who dis?</i>

17:31.300 --> 17:32.300
This is Michael

17:32.343 --> 17:35.971
the Architect from Good Place
Neighbourhood 1-2-3-5-8-W.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.349
I'm guessing
you've been looking for someone...

17:41.143 --> 17:43.395
called "Eleanor Shellstrop".

17:44.981 --> 17:46.606
She's here. Come and get her.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.295
Let's get out of here

18:13.426 --> 18:14.467
Hello, Trevor.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.137
Hey, there he is!
Good to see you again, Mikey!

18:17.221 --> 18:19.055
Think fast, I brought you something.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.640
Oh. Nuts! Thank you.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.767
Thank you. Ah! Wha--?

18:25.146 --> 18:27.772
Oh, flaming snake ate all
the nuts you brought me.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.983
Ugh. You're too nice to humiliate.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.194
Oh, hello. Hi.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.989
You look like a piece of crap.
Are you Eleanor?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.659
Dude, you're like a legend
in the Bad Place.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.287
Check this out! Huh?

18:43.998 --> 18:45.040
Pretty great, right?

18:45.124 --> 18:48.918
Trevor, do you know what caused this mistake?
Because I cannot figure it out.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.421
Nah, we're stumped.
But, uh... don't sweat it, champ!

18:51.505 --> 18:54.299
She's definitely one of ours.
So we'll just roll on out

18:54.383 --> 18:55.550
and you can get back to, uh...

18:55.676 --> 18:58.219
Putting rainbows up your butt,
or whatever you do here.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.013
Okay,
let's hit it, sweetheart.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.139
We got a long ride.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.641
What? Right now?

19:02.933 --> 19:05.018
Trevor, for decency's sake

19:05.102 --> 19:06.269
let her have some goodbyes.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.688
Ugh! God, good people are the worst.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.107
Okay, uh... thirty minutes.

19:11.192 --> 19:12.567
We gotta get back for "The Bachelor".

19:12.818 --> 19:14.861
I'm gonna be pissed if
I miss the rose ceremony.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.615
I just want to say once more,
for the record

19:18.699 --> 19:21.993
that this whole "Good-Bad" system
is bullshirt.

19:23.371 --> 19:26.498
There should be a Medium Place,
for people like me

19:26.791 --> 19:29.793
who kinda sucked,
but in like a fun, chill way.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.588
I agree. I'm sorry there isn't.

19:33.881 --> 19:37.926
I'm sorry I dragged you into this,
and that I never did laundry

19:39.178 --> 19:41.554
and that I waited until you were
about to do yours

19:41.639 --> 19:44.724
then secretly tossed mine into the basket
to trick you into doing it.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.060
You didn't trick me.
I repeatedly asked you to stop.

19:47.395 --> 19:50.522
Just know you did everything
you could to help me.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.233
You're a really good fake soulmate.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.079
What are you guys doing here?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.623
Well, we thought it was only proper
to see you off.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.083
It's the neighbourly thing to do.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.880
You guys came to say goodbye
because you're my friends.

20:15.965 --> 20:20.969
Well, I suppose
some part of me, possibly

20:21.053 --> 20:23.763
has a sense of casual kinship with you

20:24.890 --> 20:26.433
as much as one might be fond
of a street cat.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.352
Thanks, Tahani.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.855
I'm sorry for everything.

20:34.650 --> 20:35.859
I'm really glad we're friends.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.278
Oh! Goodbye forever.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.280
Jianyu.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.328
Jianyu keeps such a stoic face.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.582
I just hope he sends her off
with some sustaining wisdom.

20:52.334 --> 20:58.757
I hate to see you go,
but I love to watch you walk away.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.718
I really needed to hear that.
Thanks.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.346
Oh, hey dum-dum!
You ready to go?

21:05.890 --> 21:07.599
Oh. You must be Chidi.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.434
Trying to improve her?

21:09.810 --> 21:10.852
Bold plan, bro.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.813
Bold and stupid.
My favourite combo.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.523
Well, actually,
she learned a great deal

21:15.608 --> 21:17.400
in a very short amount of time.
- Oh, really? Really?

21:17.485 --> 21:19.402
I don't care.
All right, let's hit it.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.154
Oh, also you should smile more.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.615
You have such a pretty smile.
Love ya, babe.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.116
Can't wait to torture you.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.790
This is the 3:18 to The Bad Place

21:31.874 --> 21:35.543
making thousands of stops
for literally no reason.

21:36.045 --> 21:39.422
Now as soon as you take your seats
we will pull away from the station

21:39.507 --> 21:42.509
and then immediately be
delayed for forty-nine minutes

21:42.760 --> 21:43.927
and not explain why.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.972
You'll notice it's very hot in here,
and it will get one degree hotter

21:48.307 --> 21:50.141
every time you think about how hot it is.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.852
Oops! You just thought about it.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.689
Michael!
- Oh, hi, Chidi.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.274
Want some pizza?

21:58.692 --> 22:02.028
Bad Place crew delivered a hundred
of these to my office.

22:02.112 --> 22:05.573
All Hawaiian, the worst pizza.
- Michael, I murdered Janet.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.410
I knew about Eleanor,
from the beginning.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.579
I've been trying to help her become
a better person

22:11.664 --> 22:13.248
and when she found out that
your "retirement" meant

22:13.290 --> 22:14.249
that you would be tortured

22:14.375 --> 22:16.000
she immediately tried to find
a way to prevent it.

22:16.085 --> 22:19.128
Which is why I ended up murdering Janet.

22:19.463 --> 22:23.466
The point is, Eleanor is learning.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.760
She's just doing it after she died.

22:26.512 --> 22:30.431
And you did bring her here so,
in many ways, this is your fault.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.103
Yes. Jianyu actually made that same point.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.479
He did?
- Mmm.

22:36.897 --> 22:41.150
Okay, look... I... I know you only
deal in black or white

22:41.402 --> 22:42.485
good or bad.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.405
But you said it yourself,
this situation is...

22:46.574 --> 22:47.615
unprecedented.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.827
I did enjoy her company.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.415
But this is not Little League.

22:55.958 --> 22:59.085
There is no award
for Most Improved Player, Chidi.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.588
Well, maybe there should be.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.340
One final note

23:04.550 --> 23:08.386
the dining car is at the very back
of the train.

23:08.762 --> 23:12.515
It serves only room temperature
Manhattan clam chowder

23:12.766 --> 23:14.726
and also it's closed.

23:15.603 --> 23:16.769
Okay! Here we go!

23:23.652 --> 23:25.862
Stop this train!

23:30.242 --> 23:31.534
Dude, what the fork?

23:31.744 --> 23:32.785
You're not leaving.

23:33.203 --> 23:36.414
Not with her. Not yet. Come on.

23:40.586 --> 23:41.920
Wait, you want to keep her?

23:42.504 --> 23:45.048
Bro, that's our girl!
We agreed on this!

23:45.257 --> 23:48.259
No, what we agreed on was
that this was a mistake.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.095
Trevor,
we're in uncharted territory here.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.723
Until we can sort this out,
she stays with us.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.183
All right, fine.

23:55.392 --> 23:58.227
But until this is resolved,
we're keeping the other Eleanor.

23:58.646 --> 23:59.729
Fine. What? I'm sorry.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.482
The other Eleanor?
Yeah, the real Eleanor.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.276
The one that was supposed to be here,
but got sent down to us instead.

24:05.361 --> 24:06.402
She's on the train.
