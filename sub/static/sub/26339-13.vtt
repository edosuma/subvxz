WEBVTT

00:02.132 --> 00:05.092
Oh, my God, you guys,
I have to tell you something.

00:05.135 --> 00:06.745
It's huge. It is going to
blow your minds. I --

00:06.789 --> 00:08.182
Hi, so --

00:08.225 --> 00:10.271
Sorry, Miss Adams, we're kind of
in the middle of something --

00:10.314 --> 00:13.056
Oh, really? Because
I'm in the middle of
teaching your children.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.058
But, by all means,
you go first.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.321
-No, you go.
-Okay, Angie,

00:17.365 --> 00:19.236
Graham signed up
for the talent show

00:19.280 --> 00:20.933
as a -- am I
reading this right --

00:20.977 --> 00:23.110
a "hot lunch
mentalist"?

00:23.153 --> 00:24.720
Yeah, he can
remember anything

00:24.763 --> 00:26.722
the school cafeteria
served on any given date.

00:26.765 --> 00:28.680
It's legitimately amazing.
I discovered it in carpool.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.291
Yo, G --

00:30.334 --> 00:31.857
October 5th?

00:31.901 --> 00:34.164
10/5?

00:34.208 --> 00:35.644
Tater tots...

00:35.687 --> 00:37.341
and corn niblets

00:37.385 --> 00:40.431
rounded out the tray for
the big square headliner --

00:40.475 --> 00:42.085
corn dogs!

00:42.129 --> 00:43.086
Nailed it.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.435
I love dogs.

00:44.479 --> 00:45.610
Find someone
who cares, Mark.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.961
All right, well, if you thought
thatwas amazing,

00:49.005 --> 00:50.354
hold on to your hats,
because you will not
believe what I'm about --

00:50.398 --> 00:52.269
You guys, what's going on
with Mark?

00:52.313 --> 00:55.098
His wife left him, and now he's
desperate to join our group.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.318
Anybody want to help me out?
I made too many dumplings.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.494
Divorced dad hack -- make all
your dumplings on Sunday night.

00:59.537 --> 01:00.799
You'll thank me
on Friday.

01:00.843 --> 01:02.105
-No! I won't thank you!

01:02.149 --> 01:03.498
No one
will thank you!

01:03.541 --> 01:06.327
Dude, give Mark
a break.

01:06.370 --> 01:07.806
So he stole your pen
a year ago.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.721
He's a nice guy.
-Yes, very nice.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.723
-Now, my news --
-No, I'm with Douglas.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.899
No Mark. It's a whole thing.
-That sounds juicy.

01:13.943 --> 01:16.250
-It's barely anything.
-Sounds even juicier.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.338
-Okay, can we just drop it?
-That's it!

01:17.381 --> 01:18.991
I'm just gonna
tell you my news.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.297
Mia's not my ex.

01:20.341 --> 01:23.344
You never initialed page 89
of our divorce papers.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.302
What?This is from my lawyer.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.130
We're technically
still married.

01:30.264 --> 01:31.700
Oh, juicy!

01:31.743 --> 01:33.571
Read the room, Mark.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.747
--Captions by VITAC--

01:39.273 --> 01:41.753
What if this is a sign that we
weren't meant to get divorced?

01:41.797 --> 01:44.278
What if the universe is giving
our marriage a second chance?

01:44.321 --> 01:46.758
Dude, a backslide kiss
and messed-up paperwork

01:46.802 --> 01:48.412
doesn't mean you should
get back together.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.197
Yeah, you split up
for good reasons, Will.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.720
Need a reminder?
Give us the list.

01:51.763 --> 01:54.592
A difference
in parenting philosophies,

01:54.636 --> 01:57.726
she's an infuriating mix
of selfless and selfish,

01:57.769 --> 02:00.337
and if I'm being honest,
she eats yogurt weird.

02:00.381 --> 02:01.991
She, like, puts a big glob
on a spoon

02:02.034 --> 02:03.514
and licks it off
like ice cream.

02:03.558 --> 02:04.646
-Ugh.
-What?

02:04.689 --> 02:06.213
Even took a picture
just to remind myself.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.216
Oh, that's a stupid way
to eat yogurt.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.434
-No.
-Unh-unh.

02:10.478 --> 02:13.394
But worst of all, she always
puts her work first.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.831
Before me, before Sophie,
before her family.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.267
Yeah, and has that
changed?

02:17.311 --> 02:18.312
No.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.401
But Mia's got
a hold on me.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.577
Like, when she speaks
in a foreign language,

02:22.620 --> 02:24.187
it's so hot.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.102
Je voudrais
trois crÃªpes.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.844
Une avec le banane
et du miel.

02:28.887 --> 02:31.412
Une avec le bleuet.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.327
Cold shower, anyone?

02:33.370 --> 02:34.328
No.

02:34.371 --> 02:35.894
The point is --
I need help.

02:35.938 --> 02:37.069
I need Angie.

02:37.113 --> 02:38.810
What? Why? Why me?

02:38.854 --> 02:40.334
'Cause you're scary.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.987
You're like a tiny, little
mercenary in a blazer.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.555
Mia is only here
for one more day.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.340
I need you to make sure
I sign these papers

02:46.383 --> 02:47.384
no matter
what I say or do.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.691
Okay, but I warn you.

02:49.734 --> 02:53.347
You are entering a cold
and unforgiving world called

02:53.390 --> 02:54.348
tough love.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.436
Okay. Okay, great.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.351
Thank you so much.
She is the best --

02:57.394 --> 02:58.569
Ow! Why?

02:58.613 --> 03:00.005
Tough love!

03:00.049 --> 03:02.138
Now, initial that page,
and I'll mail them out.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.705
It's not that simple.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.663
I have to get them
notarized.
I'm a notary.

03:05.707 --> 03:06.795
What? When? How?Stunned. I'm stunned.

03:06.838 --> 03:09.493
I knew it, Angie.
Somehow I always knew.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.323
Hey!

03:13.367 --> 03:15.325
Look at
this poor bastard.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.371
Don't make eye contact.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.415
You don't like Mark?

03:18.459 --> 03:19.851
Look how he holds
that stop sign.

03:19.895 --> 03:20.939
So cute!

03:20.983 --> 03:22.463
Oh, it's awkward.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.465
-Oh, that sounds juicy.
-No, it's barely anything.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.293
Okay, enough.
Just spill the beans, damn it!

03:26.336 --> 03:27.294
Fine.
There was an encounter.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.951
Bet you're wondering why
I'm eating dumplings in my car.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.649
I...have a hunch.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.259
It's because
I'm divorced.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.260
Wanna go out?

03:38.305 --> 03:40.045
Obviously I said no.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.656
I mean, Mark's too nice.
I don't like nice.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.266
With nice,
you're in bed by 8:30.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.267
Mnh-mnh.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.965
I want Pow!
Boing! Crackle!

03:47.009 --> 03:48.445
Mark's got crackle!

03:48.489 --> 03:50.230
Okay, she's not dating him.
I forbid it.

03:51.579 --> 03:52.928
What? What's the problem?
What'd I say?

03:52.971 --> 03:54.843
You forbidme?I -- No.

03:54.886 --> 03:56.758
I'm just telling you,
as a friend,

03:56.801 --> 03:58.368
you cannot do it.

03:58.412 --> 04:01.545
Oh, you don't know anything
about black women, do you?

04:01.589 --> 04:04.287
I don't feel like there's
a good answer to that question.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.335
Hey!

04:08.378 --> 04:11.207
I dropped the paperwork off
with my notary.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.339
She's going to put it
in the mail,

04:12.382 --> 04:15.080
and we will
really be divorced.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.560
Yay!

04:16.604 --> 04:17.779
Ya dumped.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.219
You know, Will, um...

04:25.395 --> 04:28.311
...I've been thinking
about us.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.573
The couple
so dysfunctional,

04:29.617 --> 04:31.314
they couldn't even
get divorced right?

04:32.489 --> 04:33.795
I've been thinking about,

04:33.838 --> 04:35.536
you know,
how much you've changed.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.668
You're so happy
and confident,

04:37.712 --> 04:40.149
and I even detect a little
more bass in your voice.

04:41.411 --> 04:44.458
Do you think those papers
were maybe a sign?

04:47.243 --> 04:48.200
Look, Mia --

04:48.244 --> 04:49.985
I've changed, too.

04:50.028 --> 04:53.031
I know that I haven't been there
for you and Sophie,

04:53.075 --> 04:54.381
but I wantto be.

04:54.424 --> 04:57.122
Maybe I could cut back
a little at work

04:57.166 --> 04:59.734
so that we could spend
more time together as a family,

04:59.777 --> 05:01.475
and --

05:02.432 --> 05:04.347
It's my mosquito-nets guy.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.131
But I can
call him back.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.829
No. Take it.

05:07.872 --> 05:08.830
Okay.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.528
Salut, Manuel.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.030
Okay!

05:36.074 --> 05:37.511
Will,
did you run here?

05:37.554 --> 05:38.512
Did I?
That's weird.

05:38.555 --> 05:39.817
Hey, Graham.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.079
Hey, Dubs.
Wanna practice?

05:41.123 --> 05:42.167
Uh, sure.

05:42.211 --> 05:43.255
November 7th.

05:44.474 --> 05:45.997
Carrots
and chicken nuggets.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.434
Way to go, buddy.

05:47.477 --> 05:49.392
Hey, did you mail
those divorce papers yet?

05:49.436 --> 05:50.654
No, no, not yet,

05:50.698 --> 05:52.439
but they're sealed,
stamped, ready to go.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.266
Great, great.
Can I see them, please?

05:55.442 --> 05:56.094
Why?

05:56.138 --> 05:58.445
Um...no reason.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.190
Wha-- Angie! Angie!
Give me the envelope!

06:05.234 --> 06:06.540
-No!
-Angie, please!

06:06.583 --> 06:08.455
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-Angie! Angie!

06:08.498 --> 06:10.805
Please!
-This is for your own good!

06:13.677 --> 06:16.027
You told me
to go full D'Amato.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.202
Think about the yogurt!

06:17.246 --> 06:18.421
Maybe the rest of us
are eating it wrong.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.684
And she's changed.
Now give me the envelope.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.644
No one changes!
The envelope goes in the mail!

06:23.687 --> 06:25.210
Good luck
getting past me.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.996
I was third-string goalie
on my sixth grade soccer team.

06:28.039 --> 06:28.997
Check out my reflexes.

06:30.607 --> 06:31.652
Ha!

06:40.748 --> 06:41.618
You can't open
another person's mailbox!

06:41.662 --> 06:42.402
That's a federal offense.

06:43.707 --> 06:44.665
Oh, is it?

06:49.060 --> 06:51.019
Angie? Are you
in my mailbox?

06:51.062 --> 06:53.151
Back in the house, Joe.
This doesn't concern you.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.285
Will. If you take that envelope
out of the mailbox,

06:56.328 --> 06:57.329
you're off the grid.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.114
You wouldn't.

06:59.157 --> 07:01.725
The grid
is for single parents.

07:01.769 --> 07:04.598
If you're married, you surrender
all babysitting privileges

07:04.641 --> 07:06.251
and your seat at the table
to discuss them.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.862
You're bluffing.
I'm not.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.474
So what's it gonna be?

07:21.789 --> 07:24.313
Sorry. I'm awaiting
DNA results for my dog.

07:27.577 --> 07:30.275
What?!No!You kicked Will
off the grid?

07:30.319 --> 07:32.626
He does five times the work
of a nanny...for free!

07:32.669 --> 07:35.759
Relax. Will lives
for the grid.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.326
This is gonna bring him
back to his senses.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.545
We promised to help him.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.285
Okay, did you
just kick Will off,

07:40.329 --> 07:41.852
or did you forbidhim?

07:41.896 --> 07:43.724
Here we go.
Forbid?

07:43.767 --> 07:44.681
I'm not a monster.

07:44.725 --> 07:47.118
Okay, look. I didn't mean
"forbid," all right?

07:47.162 --> 07:49.991
I was just trying to steer you
in the right direction.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.993
It was like if we went to
a restaurant you didn't know,

07:52.036 --> 07:53.385
I would order
your entree.

07:53.429 --> 07:54.996
Oh, so now
you're ordering my food?

07:55.039 --> 07:56.563
No, I didn't mean that --Okay, you know what?

07:56.606 --> 07:57.999
I'm gonna take
the shovel out of your hand

07:58.042 --> 07:59.522
before you dig this hole
any deeper.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.351
There is a new member
of the grid.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.658
A man you all know
and tolerate --

08:04.701 --> 08:06.877
Dr. Mark Rush.

08:06.921 --> 08:09.314
Hard no.
Mark is dead weight.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.012
Hard yes.
Love me some Mark.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.709
Mark: Hey, guys!

08:12.753 --> 08:15.669
I brought some cookies!
Baked enough for everyone here.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.888
Well, then you over-baked,
because it's gonna be

08:17.932 --> 08:20.151
a cold, crisp,
wintry day in hell

08:20.195 --> 08:22.806
before I eat
any of those cookies.

08:22.850 --> 08:23.546
I'lltake a cookie.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.723
Hi, Mark.
-Hey, Poppy.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.901
Hey, guys.
I brought --

08:30.945 --> 08:33.600
Oh, snap. They both
brought cookies.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.210
Oh, I see.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.604
Looks like you've really
kicked me off the grid, huh?

08:37.647 --> 08:39.475
Yep.
Peace out, Coop!

08:39.519 --> 08:42.478
Well, I don't need
to try those gingersnaps

08:42.522 --> 08:43.827
to know
that they're perfect.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.700
So, I guess,
take care of them, Mark.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.488
Y-You can still
babysit Jack...

08:52.532 --> 08:53.489
off-grid!

08:53.533 --> 08:54.490
Call me!

08:54.534 --> 08:56.710
You guys,
stay strong.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.712
Happy to be part of the grid.
A few things about me.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.627
I have seven kids,
ages 5 to 18,

09:00.670 --> 09:02.672
and none of
their activities overlap.

09:06.633 --> 09:07.590
Mia?

09:07.634 --> 09:09.592
Hey. I didn't expect
to see you here.

09:09.636 --> 09:10.593
I know.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.160
So, did Will tell you

09:12.203 --> 09:13.857
that we're gonna
give it another shot?

09:13.901 --> 09:15.598
Yeah,
that's really great.

09:15.642 --> 09:16.860
I'm happy for you --

09:16.904 --> 09:18.862
I have to take this.
It's international.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.211
Sure.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.606
I can speak Spanish, too.

09:23.650 --> 09:26.653
Uno, dos, tres...

09:26.696 --> 09:27.828
Gracias.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.481
Mark Consuelos...

09:29.525 --> 09:30.874
Who were you
talking to?
Who were you
talking to?

09:30.918 --> 09:32.746
My relief team
in Oaxaca.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.443
The visas came through,

09:34.486 --> 09:36.663
so as of next week,
I'll be in Mexico

09:36.706 --> 09:38.752
representing dissident
human rights prisoners.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.492
Wait, Mexico?
What about Will?

09:40.536 --> 09:42.625
Oh, yeah,
Will and Sophie will come.

09:42.669 --> 09:43.626
He'll want to keep
the family together.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.846
No, I know,
but he has a life here,

09:45.889 --> 09:47.891
friends,
and a new job,

09:47.935 --> 09:51.416
a real one where he has to put
on pants and leave the house.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.679
He'd have to quit.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.681
I know.
I feel terrible.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.508
And I know
my tone is misleading,

09:56.552 --> 09:57.684
but I really mean it.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.120
But also,
doesn't he just, like,

09:59.163 --> 10:01.339
do the weather once a week
at 5:00 a.m.?

10:01.383 --> 10:02.776
Yeah,
the "Five Day at Five."

10:02.819 --> 10:04.865
It's important to him.
All of this is.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.737
You can't rip it away
without consulting him.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.261
Well...
I'm gonnatalk to him.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.915
Yeah, I mean,
you definitely need to,

10:11.959 --> 10:13.308
because you know Will.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.571
You know he needs time
to process.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.792
I'm confused. Aren't you just,
like, his babysitting friend?

10:18.835 --> 10:20.750
You're talking
like you'rehis wife.

10:22.404 --> 10:23.492
Oh, my God.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.320
It never gets old

10:25.363 --> 10:27.148
seeing so many people
with shoes on.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.675
Oh, great.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.677
They found a parent to volunteer
to sit on their ass.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.027
I'm helping.
I brought Tony.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.681
Attaboy, Tony!

10:38.725 --> 10:41.118
Make it to five, and I'm
taking you out for branzino.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.555
Hey, Poppy! Guess who got
put in charge of music?

10:43.599 --> 10:45.166
I'll give you a hint.
He has seven kids

10:45.209 --> 10:46.863
and an unfurnished
studio apartment.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.952
I'm not gonna lie.
That is sexy as hell.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.967
So...you like that.

11:04.011 --> 11:04.838
Mm-hmm. Damn right.

11:04.881 --> 11:07.536
âª That my life ran on too fastâª

11:07.579 --> 11:10.147
âª And I had to take it slowlyâª

11:10.191 --> 11:13.281
âª Just to make
the good part lastâª

11:13.324 --> 11:15.892
âª But when you're born to runâª

11:15.936 --> 11:17.764
âª It's so good
to just slow downâª

11:17.807 --> 11:18.982
What the hell?

11:19.026 --> 11:21.985
âª So don't be surprised
to see meâª

11:22.029 --> 11:24.161
âª Back in
the bright part of townâª

11:24.205 --> 11:29.079
âª I'll be back
in the high life againâª

11:29.123 --> 11:31.821
âª All the doors
I closed one timeâª

11:31.865 --> 11:33.910
âª Will open up again âª

11:36.043 --> 11:40.003
âª I'll be back
in the high life againâª

11:40.047 --> 11:41.918
Well, damn.

11:41.962 --> 11:44.181
It sucks without
having Will on the grid.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.227
I miss him, too.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.794
I'm gonna call him.No, you can't!

11:47.837 --> 11:50.884
My mom says this will
only last a few more days.

11:50.927 --> 11:51.885
Tough love.

11:51.928 --> 11:52.755
I don't know.

11:52.799 --> 11:55.323
We have to stay strong.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.585
You're right.

11:56.628 --> 11:57.847
But what about you?

11:57.891 --> 11:59.414
Will's the one
calling the dates

11:59.457 --> 12:01.198
for your hot lunch
mentalist act.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.897
I will do my act
without Will Cooper.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.246
Oh, snap.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.771
Just erasing my life.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.860
No biggy.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.906
Guess what?! I got
the green light for Oaxaca.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.168
We're going to Mexico.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.474
Like a trip?
No, to live!

12:16.518 --> 12:18.041
I'm helping
human rights prisoners,

12:18.085 --> 12:19.869
and I figured out a way
for you and Sophie to come.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.915
That is...

12:21.958 --> 12:23.003
a lot to process!

12:23.046 --> 12:25.005
I know.
I'm excited, too.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.442
This is a huge opportunity
for me.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.792
Plus, we both want Sophie
to see other cultures,

12:29.836 --> 12:32.621
and this will be a great way
for us to focus on our family

12:32.664 --> 12:35.842
without first-world
distractions, like, you know,

12:35.885 --> 12:38.061
movies and air conditioning
and refrigerators.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.411
Really?
I'm pro-refrigerator.

12:40.455 --> 12:41.978
Well, they're bad
for food.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.023
I don't think
that's true.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.415
Well, it is.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.287
Anyway,
this is gonna be great!

12:46.330 --> 12:48.158
Yes, yes, so great!

12:48.202 --> 12:51.640
No, i-it's just that
Sophie has school here,

12:51.683 --> 12:53.076
you know, and --
and her friends,

12:53.120 --> 12:55.470
and then there's also
my new job...

12:55.513 --> 12:58.038
They're actually talking about
putting me on at 6:00 this week.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.517
A.M.?
Yeah.

12:59.561 --> 13:00.692
I'm the morning guy.

13:00.736 --> 13:03.652
I have a Facebook group --
16 members.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.175
Some call it a fan page.
I don't know.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.874
But Mexico will only be
for a few months.

13:07.917 --> 13:11.007
Plus, it means that
our family will be together.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.922
You want that, right?

13:15.142 --> 13:17.231
That is what I want.Excellent.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.102
Okay, I'm gonna start
making the arrangements.

13:19.146 --> 13:20.234
Now, I forget.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.627
Are you an extra-long floor mat
or just a long?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.934
Oh, you're
jumping right into the details.

13:24.978 --> 13:25.979
That's great.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.285
I do think
that when we tell Sophie,

13:28.329 --> 13:30.331
we should do it
delicately,

13:30.374 --> 13:32.246
you know,
very, very gradually.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.987
But not toogradually.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.423
You know, maybe we'll tell her
tonight after the talent show.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.641
We leave in a week!

13:36.685 --> 13:37.642
A week?!

13:37.686 --> 13:38.905
Are you okay?

13:38.948 --> 13:40.515
Yeah.
I'm -- I'm sorry.

13:40.558 --> 13:43.735
I'm just still processing
all of it, you know?

13:43.779 --> 13:45.694
Uh, okay, seven days.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.304
Mexico!

13:58.925 --> 14:00.056
Excuse me.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.058
Sorry.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.668
Sorry.
Excuse me.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.756
Hey.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.150
Ma'am, uh, cutting
is so not allowed.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.109
Whatever. We're both coming
hot off federal mailbox crimes.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.937
Yeah.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.678
Um, there's actually something
I want to tell you.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.465
Mia got a job offer
in Mexico.

14:17.508 --> 14:18.901
And wants Sophie and I
to go with her.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.511
What'd you say?

14:20.555 --> 14:21.338
I said yes.

14:23.036 --> 14:25.473
But  I don't know.
Am I doing the right thing?

14:25.516 --> 14:27.344
I can't even imagine
telling Sophie.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.172
It's only for a few months,
but still --

14:29.216 --> 14:30.086
Will.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.305
You should go.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.785
Go?
Mm-hmm.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.918
I thought you would
talk me outof going.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.746
Wait, is this a trap?
Are you gonna punch me again?

14:37.789 --> 14:39.835
No.
No more tough love.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.967
I've been way too invested
in your life.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.925
I'm just someone
who helps you babysit.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.144
Angie --

14:44.187 --> 14:46.189
You're gonna do great
in Mexico.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.582
But...

14:47.625 --> 14:49.192
Graham is really
gonna miss Sophie.

14:50.802 --> 14:53.936
Sophie will definitely
miss Graham.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.595
I'm gonna go back
to my place in line.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.989
I'm on a real roll here.
Doing all the right things.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.816
Who are you?

15:08.472 --> 15:09.996
You know some days
you wake up

15:10.039 --> 15:11.736
and your whole body's
just tingling?

15:11.780 --> 15:13.042
That's today.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.000
Are you through?
With what?

15:14.043 --> 15:15.958
Okay, fine.
I'll say it.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.829
I was wrong.

15:17.873 --> 15:20.789
I told you who you could date,
and you rubbed my face in it.

15:20.832 --> 15:23.183
As I deserved. Okay?
Is that what you want to hear?

15:23.226 --> 15:25.185
Well, yeah, that was all right.
That must've been hard for you.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.360
You have no idea.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.059
And I never want to think
about that kiss again.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.105
It's worse than the summer
I spent snapping necks

15:32.148 --> 15:33.715
at my Uncle Eddie's
chicken farm.

15:35.499 --> 15:36.544
What?

15:36.587 --> 15:38.589
I think I'm into Mark.

15:39.939 --> 15:40.896
Oh, please.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.030
Really?

15:44.073 --> 15:46.206
But...it's Mark.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.251
You and Mark
don't make sense.

15:48.295 --> 15:49.513
Why not?
Because...

15:52.516 --> 15:53.996
...he's not your person.

15:55.432 --> 15:58.087
âª Hey, what do you know

15:58.131 --> 16:01.830
âª It's time for
the Hilltop Talent Show âª

16:06.269 --> 16:08.141
Hey, how strict
is the Mexico time table?

16:08.184 --> 16:09.620
Just --
'cause if we pushed it

16:09.664 --> 16:11.448
back to summer,
then we wouldn't have to --

16:11.492 --> 16:13.842
Well, I'm trying to get
human rights prisoners released.

16:13.885 --> 16:16.062
They've been wrongfully
imprisoned for, like, 15 years,

16:16.105 --> 16:18.586
so I guess another six months
wouldn't kill them.

16:18.629 --> 16:19.456
Mm.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.718
You know,
unless it did.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.156
But, you know,
if I push the dates,

16:23.199 --> 16:25.636
then I'll definitely miss
the trial in Honduras.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.464
Honduras?

16:27.508 --> 16:29.292
How long do you have to be
in Honduras?

16:29.336 --> 16:30.511
Well, the last case
took, like, a year.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.165
A year?!
Shh!

16:32.208 --> 16:34.384
My son is
trying to focus.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.125
There could be reps
in here.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.040
We're sorry.
He -- He's very talented.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.041
They'd be fools
not to sign him.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.962
Hey. Mark. Hi.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.095
Listen, that kiss...

16:49.138 --> 16:51.097
was crackle, right?

16:51.140 --> 16:52.185
Mm-hmm.

16:52.228 --> 16:55.057
So, I say...

16:55.101 --> 16:56.276
let's do this.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.234
Wow, Poppy.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.324
I can't.
Excuse me?

17:01.368 --> 17:02.412
The grid
is life-changing.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.066
I took a two-hour shower
yesterday.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.502
I made my own bed!

17:05.546 --> 17:07.765
I can't risk anything
that would complicate that.

17:07.809 --> 17:10.116
No. No. That's not
the way this works.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.204
You don't say no to me.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.553
It's not you.

17:12.596 --> 17:13.641
It's the grid.

17:13.684 --> 17:14.642
The grid?

17:14.685 --> 17:15.686
What? Hey!

17:15.730 --> 17:17.732
You don't walk away
from Poppy!

17:17.775 --> 17:18.863
I forbid it!

17:20.474 --> 17:22.519
All right, 21 Grams.
You can do this.

17:22.563 --> 17:25.261
Ladies and gentlemen,
your hot lunch mentalist --

17:25.305 --> 17:27.089
Graham D'Amato!

17:27.133 --> 17:28.569
Go get 'em, Graham.

17:32.921 --> 17:35.576
I will now select
a month at random.

17:35.619 --> 17:40.189
I will now select
a dateat random.

17:41.321 --> 17:42.365
April...

17:42.409 --> 17:43.801
6th.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.803
Ah, yes.

17:45.847 --> 17:49.155
April...6th.

17:49.198 --> 17:52.593
The...hot lunch was...

17:52.636 --> 17:54.160
Graham?

17:54.203 --> 17:55.813
While we're still young,
please.

17:58.294 --> 18:00.514
Oh, my God, this is bad.
We're gonna have to move.

18:02.385 --> 18:05.171
April...6th.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.173
He's looking for
an escape route.

18:07.216 --> 18:08.043
No.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.176
He's looking for my dad.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.483
And what's after
Honduras?

18:13.527 --> 18:15.268
Caracas? Guyana?

18:15.311 --> 18:17.226
Braavos?
Casterly Rock?

18:17.270 --> 18:18.706
Those last two
are from "Game of Thrones."

18:20.229 --> 18:22.536
Mia, a few months is one thing,
but a whole year?

18:22.579 --> 18:24.059
Sophie's happy here.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.800
And you said you were gonna
scale back at work.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.062
In a couple years!

18:27.106 --> 18:28.803
I have people
depending on me.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.761
I have people
depending on me, too.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.763
These people are nice,
but come on.

18:32.807 --> 18:33.634
They aren't your family.

18:34.635 --> 18:37.072
Dad? Dad!

18:37.116 --> 18:38.421
Graham's flatlining.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.511
I have to go.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.296
What?
This is important!

18:43.339 --> 18:45.254
So are they.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.214
April 6th...

18:48.257 --> 18:49.519
April 6th...

18:49.563 --> 18:51.304
Oh, boy.

18:51.347 --> 18:52.653
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.613
6...

18:56.657 --> 18:58.398
D-- Just --

18:58.441 --> 18:59.573
Work!

18:59.616 --> 19:00.965
April 6th...

19:01.009 --> 19:02.750
Excuse me, ladies.
Mind if I jump in?

19:02.793 --> 19:04.404
Please.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.884
You think
we want this stink on us?

19:06.928 --> 19:08.451
Hi, buddy.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.888
All right, April 6th --
you got this.

19:10.932 --> 19:12.194
Ain't no thing...

19:12.238 --> 19:14.631
But a chicken wing!

19:14.675 --> 19:17.547
On April 6th,
there was cheese -- grilled.

19:17.591 --> 19:20.246
The peas were buttered.
The fries were curly.

19:20.289 --> 19:21.769
Add a box of milk

19:21.812 --> 19:23.640
and a Jell-O square
with a dollop of whip.

19:23.684 --> 19:26.556
And that, my friends,
was April 6th.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.649
Yeah!

19:34.085 --> 19:35.826
That's my son!

19:54.193 --> 19:55.368
Wow.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.500
So, how is it
with Mia gone?

19:57.544 --> 19:59.154
I can tell you're using
normal deodorant again.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.156
Yeah, it -- it's good.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.462
We had a long talk.

20:02.505 --> 20:06.509
And I'll always love her,
but we just don't work together,

20:06.553 --> 20:08.598
and I think we needed
to rediscover that.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.383
I'm glad you're staying.

20:10.426 --> 20:13.473
When I said
Sophie would miss Graham,

20:13.516 --> 20:15.126
I meant
that Iwould miss you.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.651
And when I said
Graham was gonna miss Sophie,

20:17.694 --> 20:18.956
I meant...

20:19.000 --> 20:20.436
Graham would
really miss Sophie.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.525
I meant that, too.Too late.
You already said it.

20:22.569 --> 20:23.483
No, I take it back.You already said it!

20:23.526 --> 20:25.267
No, well, I --
you're just a babysitting pal,

20:25.311 --> 20:27.313
and that's --
You were gonna miss me!

20:27.356 --> 20:28.879
We'll never know, 'cause
I stayed, so I can't miss you.You were gonna miss me!

20:32.448 --> 20:34.407
Announcement!
Mark -- off the grid.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.887
-Ah, yes!
-And thisguy's back in!

20:36.931 --> 20:38.411
-Hey!
-Back in!

20:38.454 --> 20:41.327
-My man.
-Yes, very excited to be back,

20:41.370 --> 20:44.068
but now we can finally address
the real bombshell of the week.

20:44.112 --> 20:45.766
Angie is a notary?!

20:45.809 --> 20:48.159
-Yes! Come on!
-Okay, we will do this once.

20:48.203 --> 20:50.684
I'll answer all of
your notary questions. Go.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.294
What's the mayor like?Can you get me
out of jury duty?

20:52.338 --> 20:54.209
Do you have a partner?
Show me your gun.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.863
You guys really don't know
what a notary is, do you?

20:55.906 --> 20:57.647
What?! Nah.

20:57.691 --> 21:00.084
Wait,
where's Poppy?

21:03.827 --> 21:05.525
Mark.

21:05.568 --> 21:06.569
You're off the grid.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.441
I am?! Dang it!

21:08.484 --> 21:10.443
But wait.
Does that mean...

21:10.486 --> 21:12.009
Get in the car.

21:12.053 --> 21:16.971
âª I'll be back
in the high life again âª

21:17.014 --> 21:19.321
âª All the doors
I closed one time âª

21:19.365 --> 21:21.497
âª Will open up again
