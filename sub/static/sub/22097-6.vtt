00:02.237 --> 00:04.762
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:37.439 --> 00:39.498
Sharon, get out of here!

00:43.545 --> 00:45.570
Where are you? Sharon!

00:47.282 --> 00:48.943
Halt! No sudden moves.

00:49.184 --> 00:50.981
Get down on your knees
and cross your ankles. Now!

00:51.052 --> 00:53.748
I am human. I am from Oasis.
It's a hamlet, a couple stops...

00:53.822 --> 00:54.846
I am out of Caprica City.

00:54.923 --> 00:56.720
I'm not a Cylon!

00:57.058 --> 00:58.685
Don't leave me!

01:01.663 --> 01:03.688
<i>Attention.
The Scorpia Traveler...</i>

01:03.765 --> 01:04.789
<i>has docked.</i>

01:04.866 --> 01:09.428
<i>Civilians currently boarding Galactica,
please proceed to security checkpoint.</i>

01:23.718 --> 01:24.707
Thank you.

01:24.786 --> 01:28.153
<i>Viper Maintenance Crew Bravo,
report to Flight three.</i>

01:28.223 --> 01:29.554
Next.

01:32.661 --> 01:33.650
Next.

01:39.768 --> 01:40.757
Next.

01:46.675 --> 01:48.108
Yeah, okay.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.350
It's all clear?
I've got your back, Chief.

02:01.523 --> 02:02.785
Thanks.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.608
Anybody see you?
No.

02:27.716 --> 02:30.412
I went through the hatch
combing on C Causeway.

02:31.186 --> 02:32.676
Good girl.

02:36.458 --> 02:40.121
<i>Bravo Team, EOD,
stand by for munitions off-loading.</i>

02:40.662 --> 02:42.254
<i>Hangar Bay two.</i>

02:52.774 --> 02:55.174
You know, sometimes at work...

02:56.144 --> 02:59.238
I try and conjure up
what your face looks like.

02:59.314 --> 03:01.305
The curve of your lips...

03:01.516 --> 03:04.349
the way your hair falls,
how you smell.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.447
You see my face every day.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.547
Yeah, but not like this.

03:37.252 --> 03:39.948
Security, XO. Send an
armed detail to meet me...

03:40.021 --> 03:43.821
in the midpoint promenade deck
causeway, C level. Approach from aft.

03:43.925 --> 03:46.018
Repeat, approach from aft.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.661
Doral!

04:05.513 --> 04:06.946
Look out!

05:18.318 --> 05:19.945
What's the count?

05:20.020 --> 05:24.150
Three dead, 13 injured. Did you
get a good look at the bomber?

05:24.224 --> 05:26.385
Yes.
It was him, right?

05:27.827 --> 05:28.953
Yes.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.792
I want to see the Master-at-Arms...

05:30.864 --> 05:32.764
in my office in 10 minutes.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.830
A Cylon?

05:35.235 --> 05:37.567
Eyewitness accounts all state
the bomber was a man.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.764
The Cylons look like us now.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.505
Like us?

05:43.376 --> 05:47.369
Yeah, they appear human.
The flesh, the blood...

05:48.848 --> 05:50.440
the whole thing.

05:51.751 --> 05:55.278
The bomber was another copy
of a man we knew as Doral...

05:55.522 --> 05:59.049
posing as the Public Relations
Officer aboard this ship.

05:59.125 --> 06:03.255
We've learned that there are
multiple versions of the same Cylon.

06:04.097 --> 06:07.032
I want you to open
an investigation immediately.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.399
I want to find out how that
Cylon, or any civilian...

06:10.470 --> 06:11.767
could break through
our security.

06:11.838 --> 06:15.467
There've been a string of security
incidents aboard ship, sir.

06:15.542 --> 06:19.239
The water tank explosion, the discovery
of explosives aboard a Raptor...

06:19.312 --> 06:21.280
and now this.
Your point?

06:23.750 --> 06:25.547
I need a free hand.

06:26.019 --> 06:29.716
The authority to follow evidence
wherever it might lead...

06:29.789 --> 06:31.984
without Command review.

06:32.192 --> 06:35.252
Independent tribunal?
Yes, sir.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.360
You'll get it.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.596
Thank you.
That will be all, Sergeant.

06:45.105 --> 06:48.597
I also strongly recommend alerting
the public to the Cylon threat.

06:48.675 --> 06:51.508
If there are other copies of
this man aboard the fleet...

06:51.578 --> 06:54.513
we should find them
before they strike again.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.548
I'll take that
under advisement.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.579
That will be all.
Sirs.

07:03.723 --> 07:07.056
Open to the public.
There's a can of worms.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.787
Keeping silent hasn't
helped us very much.

07:12.932 --> 07:17.130
Maybe shining a little light on the
situation will make things pop up.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.901
All right.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.262
Hey...

07:24.644 --> 07:26.202
I owe you one.

07:30.717 --> 07:33.413
Sir.
Colonel.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.052
Get me the President.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.027
Don't kink the line.
There, we've got it.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.220
Okay, let's go.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.165
So who's first?

07:56.843 --> 07:58.333
How about me?

07:58.678 --> 08:00.839
Hey, Chief.
How's it going there, Top?

08:00.914 --> 08:05.044
Hi. Come on. Let's have it. Come on.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.125
You people are the sorriest of the sorry.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.823
The dumbest of the dumb.

08:17.897 --> 08:22.630
The only thing you're making out of this
is a one-way trip to Sickbay or the morgue.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.467
Now, tonight,
after night call...

08:28.074 --> 08:31.066
one of you brings me twice
that length of copper tubing...

08:31.144 --> 08:33.408
a spot heater
and a CO2 scrubber...

08:33.479 --> 08:35.811
I'll show you people
how this is done.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.778
All right?

08:38.418 --> 08:41.649
Now get the hell out of here
before I change my mind.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.486
Thank you.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.148
Children.

08:57.704 --> 08:58.796
He's very handsome.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.133
You really think so?

09:01.341 --> 09:04.208
She says that about everyone.
You disagree?

09:06.412 --> 09:08.039
He's attractive.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.749
I hope you're more
convincing than that with him.

09:18.424 --> 09:20.221
If he wants to find me,
he'll head north...

09:20.293 --> 09:22.523
toward Cylon forces
he's already seen.

09:22.595 --> 09:27.464
If he wants to go alone, he'll go south,
hoping to find another way off the planet.

09:27.533 --> 09:30.434
Either way, he won't make
his move until nightfall.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.336
If he flees, he dies.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.538
<i>There's going to be a huge reaction.</i>

09:37.610 --> 09:41.740
If there are any other Cylons aboard
any of our ships, we need to find them.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.780
If we enlist the help of the
public, it'll make it a lot easier.

09:45.852 --> 09:49.549
People are going to be shocked,
angry, terrified, paranoid.

09:49.622 --> 09:53.319
<i>There is a price to be paid when
asking for the public's help.</i>

09:53.393 --> 09:55.293
<i>They're going to demand,
at the very least...</i>

09:55.361 --> 09:57.386
<i>that someone
be held accountable.</i>

09:57.463 --> 09:58.589
I'm setting up a tribunal.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.634
And that tribunal will have to
come back to the public with a name.

10:01.701 --> 10:02.861
<i>Someone who screwed up.</i>

10:02.936 --> 10:05.097
We don't know
if anybody screwed up.

10:06.172 --> 10:10.768
A Cylon agent penetrated your
security, killing three people.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.236
<i>At least one of your men
or women screwed up.</i>

10:15.148 --> 10:16.911
Look, here's my view.

10:17.750 --> 10:22.119
Independent tribunal, openness,
transparency, it all sounds great.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.880
<i>But after 20 years in political
office, I'm telling you...</i>

10:24.958 --> 10:28.724
<i>these things have a way of inflicting
damage on the people you least expect.</i>

10:28.795 --> 10:32.231
I do not want a witch hunt
on our hands.

10:34.534 --> 10:37.526
So, where were you
at the time of the bombing?

10:38.271 --> 10:41.866
In my rack, reading some
trashy novel, Socinus gave me.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.310
Did you see the Chief?
Chief?

10:46.779 --> 10:50.340
He was on the Hangar Deck going
over some paperwork, I think.

10:50.416 --> 10:53.146
How do you know that
if you were in your rack?

10:55.054 --> 10:57.545
I saw him right before
I turned in.

10:58.191 --> 11:01.524
I was with Cally, playing
Pyramid in the mess hall corridor.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.358
You sure? Yeah.
She's pretty good.

11:06.733 --> 11:09.634
Did you see the Chief?
Yeah, he was there.

11:10.269 --> 11:14.501
I mean, not the whole time, but he
dropped in, watched us play for a while.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.434
Okay.

11:19.645 --> 11:22.409
I was on watch.
Did you see the Chief?

11:22.782 --> 11:24.613
The Chief? No.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.748
He wasn't on the Hangar Deck?
No.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.022
Wait. Yeah, he was.

11:31.090 --> 11:35.049
He came in, did some work on one of
the vipers that the Captain rides.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.793
Thank you.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.673
Asleep in my rack.
Sure about that?

11:49.208 --> 11:50.641
Positive.

11:53.479 --> 11:56.141
I was asleep, Sergeant.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.442
All right.
That'll be all for now.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.904
Good afternoon, and thank you
for coming. Please be seated.

12:28.448 --> 12:32.441
<i>I'm sure by now, word of the
explosion on the Galactica...</i>

12:32.518 --> 12:34.850
has spread
through the entire fleet.

12:35.354 --> 12:39.791
We offer our continued gratitude
to the brave men and women...

12:40.226 --> 12:42.285
aboard this mighty ship.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.360
<i>In consultation with Cmdr. Adama...</i>

12:45.498 --> 12:48.626
<i>I have appointed
an independent tribunal...</i>

12:48.734 --> 12:52.795
<i>to investigate the circumstances
surrounding this explosion.</i>

12:53.206 --> 12:57.108
<i>Also, in the interest of
security and public safety...</i>

12:57.176 --> 13:01.738
<i>I feel it is time to reveal certain
information that has until now...</i>

13:02.115 --> 13:04.276
<i>remained
a tightly-guarded secret.</i>

13:04.350 --> 13:08.946
<i>This information was known
only to myself, Cmdr. Adama...</i>

13:09.655 --> 13:13.455
<i>and a few select advisors.
The cat's out of the bag.</i>

13:15.728 --> 13:19.858
The Cylons have the ability to mimic
human form. They look like us now.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.593
Did you hear that?

13:22.034 --> 13:23.899
<i>We have reason to believe...</i>

13:23.970 --> 13:26.165
<i>that a Cylon agent
was responsible...</i>

13:26.239 --> 13:28.400
<i>for the explosions
aboard Galactica.</i>

13:29.342 --> 13:32.505
This man has been
identified as a Cylon agent.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.875
We believe him to be
responsible for the bombing.

13:35.948 --> 13:40.009
<i>He evidently slipped aboard the
Galactica with a civilian group...</i>

13:40.820 --> 13:45.120
killed a Marine guard, stole the
explosives and detonated them...

13:45.825 --> 13:49.420
killing three members of the
crew and destroying himself.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.355
This man has also
been identified as a Cylon.

13:53.833 --> 13:58.099
And we now know that there are
duplicates of each Cylon model.

13:59.939 --> 14:04.876
Anyone seeing either of these two men
at any time, anywhere in the fleet...

14:05.478 --> 14:08.242
<i>should immediately contact
the Battlestar Galactica...</i>

14:08.314 --> 14:10.612
and the office
of the president.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.179
Now I'll take your questions.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.890
They've known about this the whole
time. They just decide to tell us now?

14:22.962 --> 14:25.362
Cylon?

14:26.632 --> 14:28.600
I mean, who's the Cylon now?

14:28.668 --> 14:31.466
This is too much. I don't
even want to know this.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.664
Excuse me, sir.
Will you come with us, please?

14:33.739 --> 14:34.763
What? Why?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.671
What's up?
What's going on, Sergeant?

14:36.776 --> 14:38.676
Chief, we need you to come along as well.

14:38.744 --> 14:40.905
You're arresting the Chief?
Who's arresting the chief?

14:40.980 --> 14:43.005
No one is under arrest.
What's the meaning of all this?

14:43.082 --> 14:44.447
Step back!

14:45.451 --> 14:48.318
Lieutenant asked you
a question, Sergeant.

14:49.121 --> 14:50.418
A tribunal has been
convened...

14:50.489 --> 14:52.923
to look into the Cylon
penetration of our defenses.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.893
It requires the presence of
Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol...

14:55.962 --> 14:59.261
and I am here to escort them
to the wardroom, sir.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.567
Very well. Proceed.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.331
Thank you, sir.

15:11.777 --> 15:15.008
Lieutenant, Chief,
you'll come with me, please.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.140
You're it till I get back.
Don't worry.

15:20.019 --> 15:23.455
Lt. Valerii, where were
you at the time of the explosion?

15:24.457 --> 15:26.948
I was in my rack. Asleep.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.488
Did anyone see you, sir?

15:33.199 --> 15:35.599
I don't know. I was asleep.

15:39.138 --> 15:40.696
Lieutenant...

15:41.340 --> 15:44.366
is it true that you and the
Chief are involved in a...

15:44.443 --> 15:46.741
romantic
and physical relationship...

15:46.812 --> 15:50.270
in violation of the Colonial
Code of Military Conduct?

15:50.349 --> 15:53.375
I thought this was about...
Just answer the question, please.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.649
Are you and the Chief
involved in a relationship?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.484
No.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.854
The XO ordered us to put
a stop to it, so we did.

16:11.537 --> 16:15.166
Sir, can you testify as to the
whereabouts of Chief Petty Officer Tyrol...

16:15.241 --> 16:17.334
at the time of the bombing?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.909
I have no idea where he was.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.916
Thank you, sir.
You're excused, Lieutenant.

16:26.018 --> 16:28.179
But I'm sure he had nothing
to do with the bombing...

16:28.254 --> 16:30.381
You are excused, Lieutenant.

16:31.557 --> 16:34.117
Bring in the next witness,
please.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.828
The testimony you give...

16:37.897 --> 16:39.387
before this tribunal
may be used...

16:39.465 --> 16:43.902
to adjudicate your guilt or innocence
in the matter under investigation.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.764
Do you understand?

16:48.240 --> 16:49.400
Yes.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.273
The matter being
investigated is first...

16:53.346 --> 16:57.339
<i>how a Cylon penetrated
Galactica's security system...</i>

16:58.184 --> 17:00.948
<i>and second, whether one of
Galactica's crew members...</i>

17:01.020 --> 17:02.749
aided and abetted
this crime...

17:02.822 --> 17:06.724
through conspiracy
and collusion with the Cylons.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.251
Collusion with the Cylons?

17:08.327 --> 17:11.160
Do you consent to give your
testimony freely without invoking...

17:11.230 --> 17:15.997
your right to remain silent as provided
for under the 23rd Article of Colonization?

17:19.605 --> 17:22.472
I do.
Then let's begin.

17:27.513 --> 17:30.744
They're going after the Chief.
They're going after the Cylons.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.681
What the hell does that mean?
Wake up.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.982
The world's changed while
you were asleep, little man.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.043
Frack you.

17:36.122 --> 17:39.888
Cylons look like people.
That means anyone. Anyone.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.688
Not the Chief.
How do you know?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.228
I know.
This is stupid.

17:43.295 --> 17:45.229
You two just don't want
to deal with reality.

17:45.297 --> 17:47.231
You want to keep your heads
buried in the sand.

17:47.299 --> 17:50.632
That's exactly what the Cylons
want. For us to turn on each other.

17:50.703 --> 17:54.002
Start getting suspicious,
paranoid. She's right.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.597
If we don't believe
in each other...

17:55.674 --> 17:58.234
then we don't guard each other's
backs when the heat comes down.

17:58.310 --> 18:01.871
That kind of thinking is over.
It's every man for himself now.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.211
You better watch your backs.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.754
You had the mid-watch
before the bombing, correct?

18:15.828 --> 18:16.988
Yes.

18:17.062 --> 18:20.190
Would you please explain to the
tribunal what you do on watch?

18:20.266 --> 18:23.133
I walk the perimeter
of the Hangar Deck...

18:23.569 --> 18:25.298
the tool rooms,
storage facilities.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.601
To make sure
all hatches are sealed?

18:27.673 --> 18:28.662
Yes.

18:28.741 --> 18:32.700
That no unauthorized personnel is
poking around where they shouldn't?

18:32.778 --> 18:36.544
That's right. And there was no
one on the Hangar Deck that night.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.418
I believe that's what
your log says.

18:48.093 --> 18:51.119
What about the hatch combing
for Causeway C?

18:52.498 --> 18:54.989
Anybody see you?
No.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.194
I went through the hatch
combing on C Causeway.

18:57.269 --> 19:01.535
Your log indicates that all hatches
and portals were locked and sealed.

19:01.607 --> 19:04.098
If that's what the log
indicates, then that's the case.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.542
Which would include the
hatch combing for Causeway C?

19:06.612 --> 19:08.807
I don't know where the
Sergeant is going with this...

19:08.881 --> 19:09.905
but they're not related.

19:09.982 --> 19:14.282
What if I told you that I found
the hatch open after the bombing?

19:14.353 --> 19:16.548
I would say that I don't
know how that's possible.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.351
It's not just any hatch
on the Hangar Deck.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.689
It opens onto a causeway which leads
directly to a small arms locker...

19:21.760 --> 19:23.785
where a Marine guard
was found dead at the scene.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.764
The locker was opened
with the correct code.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.531
Do you have the correct code
to that locker, Chief?

19:33.305 --> 19:36.900
Yes, I do, as do dozens of
others, including the guard.

19:36.976 --> 19:40.412
It's possible the Cylon forced the
guard to open it before he killed him.

19:40.479 --> 19:42.379
I'd like to take
this opportunity to state...

19:42.448 --> 19:44.439
that that was
an internal security matter.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.418
And internal security falls under
the purview of the Master-at-Arms.

19:47.486 --> 19:50.319
And the Master-at-Arms
is Sgt. Hadrian.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.922
Did Lt. Valerii leave the
hatch combing open last night?

19:56.462 --> 20:00.228
I have no idea who left the
hatch combing open last night.

20:04.770 --> 20:08.934
Chief, were you doing paperwork
at the time of the bombing?

20:09.008 --> 20:12.068
No. Chief, were you working on
a viper at the time of bombing?

20:12.144 --> 20:13.133
No.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.908
Were you watching a pick-up game
of Pyramid in the mess hall...

20:15.981 --> 20:16.970
at the time of the bombing?

20:17.049 --> 20:20.712
No! As I told you earlier
today, I was asleep in my rack.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.777
Then why do I have
three different statements...

20:22.855 --> 20:24.220
from three of your
deckhands...

20:24.290 --> 20:28.693
stating variously that they all saw you
and you were anywhere but in your rack?

20:30.162 --> 20:34.155
Chief Tyrol, where were you
at the time of the bombing?

20:36.869 --> 20:39.804
Were you, in fact,
meeting with a Cylon agent?

20:44.410 --> 20:47.504
I exercise my right
under Article 23.

20:53.819 --> 20:57.277
By invoking the 23rd Article at this
time, the tribunal will look on this...

20:57.356 --> 20:59.517
as further evidence of your
guilt. So I will ask you...

20:59.592 --> 21:01.526
one last time.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.422
Who were you with
at the time of the bombing...

21:04.496 --> 21:07.124
and was this person
a Cylon agent?

21:16.274 --> 21:18.401
Specialist, your
sworn statement indicates...

21:18.476 --> 21:21.934
that you were on watch at the time of the
bombing and that you saw Chief Tyrol...

21:22.013 --> 21:25.380
work on one of the vipers.
Is that true? Yes, sir.

21:25.716 --> 21:30.176
Specialist, can you explain to us why
Chief Tyrol told us in his testimony...

21:30.254 --> 21:33.781
that he was in his rack asleep
at the time of the bombing?

21:35.526 --> 21:38.427
Speak up, Specialist.
He said that?

21:38.996 --> 21:41.396
Did you see him,
or didn't you?

21:44.869 --> 21:48.134
Specialist!
No, I did not, sir.

21:48.773 --> 21:52.573
So the Chief did not come
to the Hangar Deck after all?

21:53.811 --> 21:55.438
I don't know.

21:56.180 --> 21:57.875
I left my post.

21:58.683 --> 22:00.116
Excuse me?

22:01.185 --> 22:03.119
I left my post, sir.

22:03.421 --> 22:05.753
I ducked out to get a smoke.

22:06.557 --> 22:10.049
I went to the galley to
get some chow. The Chief...

22:10.528 --> 22:13.190
I mean, I don't know
where he was.

22:13.331 --> 22:16.027
I'm sure he was asleep in
his rack, just like he said.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.125
You went to the galley?

22:18.636 --> 22:19.728
Yes, sir.

22:19.804 --> 22:22.773
Did you go through
the hatch combing on C Deck?

22:22.840 --> 22:26.105
Well, to get to the galley,
that would be the best way.

22:26.177 --> 22:28.475
Yes, sir, I went
through that hatch.

22:28.546 --> 22:31.982
Did you leave it open?
I'm not sure.

22:36.888 --> 22:38.947
Yes, sir. I think I did.

22:40.758 --> 22:42.953
Look, the Chief had nothing
to do with it. It was me.

22:43.027 --> 22:45.825
I left my post
and I left the hatch open.

22:48.733 --> 22:51.065
It was me. Just me.

22:53.137 --> 22:55.628
You realize, don't you, that
by leaving the hatch open...

22:55.706 --> 22:59.198
you allowed a Cylon to gain
access to a small arms locker?

23:01.245 --> 23:02.507
Yes, sir.

23:02.580 --> 23:06.710
Specialist, did Chief Tyrol instruct you
to leave the hatch open deliberately...

23:06.784 --> 23:11.448
as part of a conspiracy to allow the Cylon
to gain access to the small arms locker?

23:11.555 --> 23:14.183
The Chief is innocent.
He didn't do anything.

23:14.258 --> 23:17.694
Specialist, did you leave
the hatch open deliberately?

23:24.902 --> 23:26.233
Yes, sir.

23:27.805 --> 23:31.297
Whatever happened,
it was me. Just me.

23:54.265 --> 23:55.527
South.

23:56.400 --> 24:00.234
You overestimated his willingness
to risk himself for you.

24:00.404 --> 24:02.565
He just doesn't love you.

24:16.821 --> 24:18.015
Wait.

24:35.873 --> 24:38.706
North. Toward his love.

24:39.610 --> 24:42.170
Seems you made
an impression after all.

24:42.279 --> 24:45.680
He's a good man. He always
does the right thing.

24:48.686 --> 24:51.348
Are you prepared
for the next step?

24:52.156 --> 24:53.316
Yes.

24:55.292 --> 24:57.624
Hello, Lieutenant.
Doctor.

25:00.064 --> 25:03.124
I brought you a cigar.
A recovery gift.

25:03.834 --> 25:06.496
How are you?
I'm good.

25:07.471 --> 25:11.100
The food is good,
company is better.

25:11.175 --> 25:14.474
Yes, I just happened to be
absolutely nowhere near Sickbay.

25:14.545 --> 25:16.513
I thought I would...

25:18.349 --> 25:21.113
see how you were doing.
So, Doctor...

25:21.485 --> 25:24.352
your super-secret project's
on C Deck, right?

25:24.422 --> 25:27.220
I'm not at liberty to divulge
exactly what I am doing on C Deck.

25:27.291 --> 25:31.421
But you're more than welcome to
pop by once you're ambulatory.

25:32.263 --> 25:34.254
The bomber was
on C Deck, right?

25:34.331 --> 25:35.992
Yes, I know.
I heard the explosion.

25:36.067 --> 25:39.798
Very frightening. Do you think
that's where he was headed?

25:44.141 --> 25:47.542
I'm sorry. I didn't follow
you. The Cylon bomber?

25:47.978 --> 25:51.436
Do you think that he was
trying to blow up your project?

25:51.515 --> 25:53.380
And you along with it?

25:53.484 --> 25:54.917
It's funny.

25:56.387 --> 25:58.355
I hadn't thought of that.

26:00.224 --> 26:02.818
Kind of hits you
where you live, huh?

26:03.060 --> 26:05.051
Yes, it does, actually.

26:07.631 --> 26:09.462
You get well soon.

26:17.274 --> 26:18.935
They're trying to kill me.

26:19.009 --> 26:22.536
Me, always me. They're
trying to destroy your work.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.809
Destroying you is an
added bonus. But why?

26:24.882 --> 26:27.976
That's what I don't understand.
Why are they trying to blow me up?

26:28.052 --> 26:29.713
You told me what to do
in the first place.

26:29.787 --> 26:32.620
I wouldn't be making this Cylon
detector if it wasn't for you.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.954
But I'm just
in your head, Gaius.

26:35.392 --> 26:39.328
They don't know about me,
or us, or our life together.

26:39.530 --> 26:40.861
How romantic.

26:40.931 --> 26:43.365
I'm going to have to destroy
that Cylon detector myself.

26:43.434 --> 26:46.232
Blame the sabotage on Cylon
agents. That's what I'll tell Adama.

26:48.839 --> 26:50.966
No, you won't.

26:51.175 --> 26:54.838
You're going to complete the
project, just like I told you.

26:55.112 --> 26:57.273
Really? Will I?

26:58.983 --> 27:00.314
Or what?

27:01.285 --> 27:03.753
Don't make me angry, Gaius.

27:05.656 --> 27:08.250
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

27:32.249 --> 27:33.511
Sharon.

27:41.725 --> 27:43.386
Is that enough?

27:48.098 --> 27:51.625
No, Sharon wouldn't give up
without a much harder fight.

28:27.003 --> 28:29.096
Did you read the tribunal report?

28:29.172 --> 28:30.196
<i>Yes.</i>

28:31.207 --> 28:35.507
<i>And I'm sorry to read that one of your
men, has been charged with conspiracy...</i>

28:35.578 --> 28:39.947
and collusion with a Cylon
agent. Specialist Socinus.

28:40.516 --> 28:43.349
<i>But after reading the
transcripts, I have my doubts.</i>

28:43.419 --> 28:47.685
What about this other man, your
Chief Tyrol? He took the 23rd.

28:47.957 --> 28:49.549
What is that about,
do you think?

28:49.892 --> 28:51.450
It's his right.

28:52.695 --> 28:55.721
The courts have never held that
invoking the right to remain silent...

28:55.798 --> 28:57.629
can be used
as evidence of guilt.

28:57.934 --> 28:59.902
You sound like a lawyer.

29:01.204 --> 29:04.196
My father was a lawyer.
Civil liberties.

29:06.242 --> 29:09.336
Let's set aside
the legalities for a moment.

29:10.413 --> 29:13.041
Obviously,
you are defending your man.

29:13.116 --> 29:16.142
I respect that, I do.
But he is hiding something.

29:16.486 --> 29:20.217
Chief Tyrol has been under my
command for over five years.

29:20.290 --> 29:23.623
And if he really wanted
to take this ship down...

29:24.861 --> 29:27.762
he could.
I think this is over.

29:34.971 --> 29:38.634
Madam President, I'm going to
have to call you right back.

29:41.311 --> 29:42.608
What?

29:43.513 --> 29:47.005
I have orders to bring you
before the tribunal, sir.

29:57.460 --> 29:58.984
Let's go.

32:12.995 --> 32:14.292
It's okay.

32:19.602 --> 32:21.092
Helo.

32:23.139 --> 32:24.766
What's happening?

32:28.978 --> 32:32.004
Can you walk?
I think so.

32:32.682 --> 32:35.583
Come on. Okay.

32:38.187 --> 32:40.121
Now we're even.

32:46.329 --> 32:49.492
I think we should go.
Right. Okay.

32:53.870 --> 32:55.394
Come on.

32:58.641 --> 33:01.974
It's going to be all right.
You're going to be just fine.

33:08.718 --> 33:10.811
Cmdr. Adama, when did you...

33:10.887 --> 33:13.412
first learn the truth
about the Cylons?

33:13.656 --> 33:16.352
On Ragnar Station,
before we left.

33:16.659 --> 33:19.822
And you chose to withhold
this crucial information, sir?

33:19.896 --> 33:21.329
Yes. Why?

33:22.698 --> 33:23.960
I felt that...

33:24.033 --> 33:27.002
to alarm the public would only
cause chaos and panic.

33:27.069 --> 33:31.506
But you also withheld
the information...

33:31.574 --> 33:35.032
from your own security
detachment aboard ship, sir.

33:35.611 --> 33:36.976
Not knowing who to trust...

33:37.046 --> 33:41.312
I decided to keep the information
compartmentalized for the time being.

33:41.384 --> 33:45.184
Sir, isn't it true that had we known
that the Cylons appeared human...

33:45.254 --> 33:48.781
different security procedures
would have been followed?

33:48.925 --> 33:50.290
Probably.

33:50.927 --> 33:54.226
But I had to weigh the
possible ramifications of both.

33:54.330 --> 33:56.127
But isn't it also true, sir...

33:56.198 --> 33:58.962
that had different procedures
been followed...

33:59.035 --> 34:02.004
the bombing may have been
prevented? That's speculative.

34:02.071 --> 34:05.336
I'm asking if it's possible. I
know what you're asking, Sergeant.

34:05.408 --> 34:08.605
I will not speculate as to
what might have happened.

34:08.844 --> 34:11.472
Do you personally
believe that...

34:11.681 --> 34:15.242
a Cylon agent planted explosives
in the ship's water tank?

34:15.451 --> 34:16.509
Yes.

34:16.586 --> 34:21.148
Do you believe that there are Cylon
agents aboard ship even as we speak?

34:26.395 --> 34:27.760
Yes, I do.

34:32.835 --> 34:35.929
Sir, isn't it true
that you knew...

34:36.305 --> 34:41.208
that Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol
were having an illicit relationship...

34:42.078 --> 34:44.410
in violation of regulations?

34:44.614 --> 34:47.640
I don't see the relevance of this
line of questioning, Sergeant.

34:47.717 --> 34:49.241
The Commander
should bear in mind...

34:49.318 --> 34:52.412
that my questions are not
subject to Commander's review.

34:52.855 --> 34:55.050
Why did you allow the
relationship to continue...

34:55.124 --> 34:57.786
knowing it was
against regulations?

34:58.461 --> 35:00.190
I'm a soft touch.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.933
Sir, are you aware of the fact that
both Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol...

35:08.004 --> 35:11.838
have been implicated as possibly
being in collusion with the Cylons?

35:13.142 --> 35:15.838
I'm aware of the allegations.
Where are you going with this?

35:15.911 --> 35:17.845
I will ask the questions, sir.

35:17.913 --> 35:20.848
Isn't it true that by allowing
their relationship to continue...

35:20.916 --> 35:22.850
in violation of regulations...

35:22.918 --> 35:25.785
you may have made it possible
for two Cylon collaborators...

35:25.855 --> 35:29.416
to compromise the safety
and security of this ship?

35:32.895 --> 35:33.919
We're done here.

35:33.996 --> 35:36.021
Excuse me, sir, but my
questions are not finished.

35:36.098 --> 35:38.259
You've lost
your way, Sergeant.

35:38.668 --> 35:40.898
You've lost sight
of the purpose of the law.

35:40.970 --> 35:44.371
To protect its citizens,
not persecute them.

35:45.608 --> 35:48.941
Whatever we are,
whatever is left of us...

35:49.845 --> 35:51.870
we're better than that.

35:52.148 --> 35:54.241
Now these proceedings
are closed.

35:54.316 --> 35:58.753
You'll be transported back to your
ships, and we appreciate your help.

35:59.288 --> 36:00.653
Commander.

36:04.427 --> 36:08.727
This is an independent board. You
have no authority to close our inquiry.

36:13.703 --> 36:15.637
This is a witch hunt.

36:17.373 --> 36:19.967
I will not have it
aboard my ship.

36:24.547 --> 36:25.639
Corporal of the guard!

36:25.715 --> 36:28.980
Restrain the Commander and
return him to the witness chair.

36:32.321 --> 36:36.621
Your orders are to escort Sgt.
Hadrian back to her quarters...

36:36.826 --> 36:40.193
and keep her in confinement
until further notice.

36:43.966 --> 36:45.900
Make your choice, son.

36:51.674 --> 36:55.974
Sgt. Hadrian,
you'll come with us, please.

37:04.253 --> 37:06.483
She's just about to speak.

37:07.123 --> 37:10.388
Yes, I tried to get
an interview with her myself.

37:11.527 --> 37:13.654
Good evening, have a seat.

37:15.865 --> 37:19.323
The investigation into the
suicide bombing aboard Galactica...

37:19.401 --> 37:22.234
and how it was allowed to
occur, has come to a close.

37:22.304 --> 37:25.705
<i>You are all aware that
the bomber was a Cylon agent.</i>

37:26.008 --> 37:28.203
<i>The tribunal has determined...</i>

37:28.277 --> 37:31.041
<i>that the Cylon gained access
to the explosives...</i>

37:31.180 --> 37:34.638
<i>by going through a hatch door
in the Hangar Deck of the ship.</i>

37:34.717 --> 37:39.017
<i>This door was left open due to
negligence of one of the ship's crewmen.</i>

37:39.522 --> 37:41.922
<i>His name is
Specialist Socinus.</i>

37:41.991 --> 37:46.087
<i>He has confessed to lying under oath
and dereliction of duty in time of war.</i>

37:46.562 --> 37:50.293
He has been stripped of his
rank and confined to the Brig.

37:50.599 --> 37:52.567
At this point, we have
no reason to believe...

37:52.635 --> 37:55.069
<i>that there were
any other parties responsible.</i>

37:55.137 --> 37:57.503
<i>Now I'll take your questions.
You, sir.</i>

38:00.509 --> 38:02.909
Commander,
permission to enter?

38:03.712 --> 38:06.306
What is it, Chief?
Thank you, sir.

38:07.149 --> 38:09.640
Sir, I believe
that Socinus...

38:10.019 --> 38:14.388
I believe that his confession was a
lie. I think that he's covering for me.

38:14.623 --> 38:16.090
For you?

38:16.358 --> 38:21.057
I think that he's doing this out of
a sense of misplaced loyalty to me.

38:22.698 --> 38:27.135
Somewhere in this there's
truth. Care to take me to it?

38:31.707 --> 38:35.268
Sir, I was with Lt. Valerii
at the time of the bombing.

38:35.578 --> 38:38.570
The deck gang, they all knew
it. They've known all along.

38:38.647 --> 38:42.083
They're trying to cover for me.
They started lying. Socinus...

38:42.151 --> 38:43.175
I don't know.

38:43.252 --> 38:47.382
I think that he thinks he's helping
protect me by taking a fall like this.

38:47.456 --> 38:50.892
You don't really know whether
he was on duty or not, do you?

38:50.960 --> 38:54.760
Commander, he's innocent. I know
that much. I should be in the Brig.

38:54.830 --> 38:57.993
Well, that's a fact.
You should be in the Brig.

38:58.234 --> 39:00.099
Commander, this isn't right.

39:00.169 --> 39:03.070
You can't let an
innocent kid... I can't?

39:06.942 --> 39:08.842
What I can't do...

39:09.011 --> 39:11.775
is, I can't let someone
that wears this uniform...

39:11.847 --> 39:14.816
get on the witness stand
and lie under oath.

39:14.984 --> 39:16.781
And that's what your man did.

39:16.852 --> 39:20.310
He either lied the first time
or he lied the second time.

39:20.389 --> 39:22.254
And it doesn't matter.

39:22.825 --> 39:25.453
He's guilty
and he'll pay the price.

39:25.828 --> 39:29.059
You? You'll pay
a different price.

39:29.598 --> 39:32.761
You'll have to walk out on
that Hangar Deck every day...

39:32.868 --> 39:35.632
knowing that one of your men
is in the Brig...

39:35.738 --> 39:38.434
because you couldn't
keep your fly zipped.

39:40.409 --> 39:44.937
You're the most experienced
noncommissioned officer we have left.

39:45.915 --> 39:48.145
You keep my planes flying.

39:49.952 --> 39:52.250
I need my planes to fly.

39:54.623 --> 39:56.056
Dismissed.

39:59.094 --> 40:00.220
Sir.

40:16.378 --> 40:19.939
Sharon, no.
What?

40:20.015 --> 40:23.644
Sharon, we're done.
It's over.

40:26.155 --> 40:29.420
What do you mean it's over? I love you.

40:30.326 --> 40:31.953
I really do.

40:34.296 --> 40:35.695
I'm sorry.

40:38.067 --> 40:39.659
Wait a minute.

40:40.069 --> 40:43.061
I deserve more
of an explanation than that.

40:46.075 --> 40:47.440
Sure.

40:48.944 --> 40:51.378
One of my men is in the Brig.

40:52.114 --> 40:56.050
He confessed to a crime he didn't
commit, to protect me, to protect us.

40:56.118 --> 41:01.055
There can be no more "us. " No more
secrets, no more lies, that's it.

41:03.025 --> 41:04.458
It's over.

41:05.561 --> 41:08.621
I can't believe you can just
turn your back on us.

41:15.170 --> 41:18.037
I put everything
on the line for you.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.903
Everything. I cover for you,
I protect you.

41:22.177 --> 41:25.874
I risked my career, my
freedom, my integrity, for what?

41:25.981 --> 41:29.212
So some innocent kid, one of my
kids, can take the fall for me?

41:29.284 --> 41:30.444
No!

41:36.125 --> 41:40.221
We are not worth that.

41:43.265 --> 41:44.459
Okay.

41:48.203 --> 41:49.534
Right.

41:50.939 --> 41:53.169
I guess I'll see you around.

41:54.676 --> 41:56.303
One more thing.

41:59.915 --> 42:02.782
Did you leave the hatch
combing open last night?

42:07.556 --> 42:08.818
What?

42:09.591 --> 42:13.322
Did you leave the hatch
combing open last night?

42:20.602 --> 42:22.433
What are you saying?

42:23.672 --> 42:27.199
That I helped the Cylon?
I didn't say anything.

42:27.609 --> 42:31.306
I'm just asking you a question
I think I deserve an answer.

42:35.684 --> 42:38.847
You have the only answer
you're ever going to get.
