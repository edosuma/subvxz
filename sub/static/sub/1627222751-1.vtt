00:51.124 --> 00:54.393
<i>This is Free City.</i>

00:55.727 --> 00:59.565
<i>Look at this guy.
He's one of the sunglasses people.</i>

00:59.598 --> 01:02.902
<i>And the people who wear
sunglasses are heroes.</i>

01:09.210 --> 01:12.946
<i>They have a devil-may-care
attitude and they run this town.</i>

01:16.282 --> 01:17.749
You are so hot.

01:17.784 --> 01:18.785
Oh, I know.

01:21.753 --> 01:24.589
<i>See?
That's not even his car.</i>

01:25.892 --> 01:27.093
<i>Or his wife.</i>

01:32.899 --> 01:36.468
<i>For the sunglasses people,
they get to do anything they want.</i>

01:36.501 --> 01:38.537
<i>They go on
all sorts of missions.</i>

01:38.570 --> 01:41.207
<i>They got cool hair,
cool clothes.</i>

01:41.240 --> 01:46.611
<i>I mean, laws aren't really laws to them.
They're more like mild suggestions.</i>

01:46.645 --> 01:49.648
<i>Like, I don't think
he's gonna return that car.</i>

01:50.249 --> 01:51.550
<i>Or that nice lady.</i>

02:06.465 --> 02:09.768
<i>See what I mean? Hero.</i>

02:24.616 --> 02:29.155
<i>My name is Guy,
and I live in paradise.</i>

02:34.227 --> 02:35.795
Good morning, Goldie.

02:37.964 --> 02:39.966
<i>I've lived here in Free City
my whole life.</i>

02:39.999 --> 02:42.567
<i>I've got a best friend,
I've got a goldfish,</i>

02:42.601 --> 02:45.238
<i>and I work at the bank.</i>

02:45.271 --> 02:46.806
<i>What more could a guy want?</i>

02:46.839 --> 02:48.207
<i>Sunday
should be warm and sunny</i>

02:48.241 --> 02:49.776
<i>with just a scattering
of drive-bys.</i>

02:49.809 --> 02:52.211
<i>Great day for the beach,
but not Hitman's Beach,</i>

02:52.245 --> 02:54.479
<i>which will be mined and
sprayed with high-caliber fire</i>

02:54.513 --> 02:56.082
<i>from a renegade
gunship stolen by...</i>

02:56.115 --> 02:57.016
<i>And every morning,</i>

02:57.050 --> 03:00.219
<i>I start my day
with the most delicious coffee</i>

03:00.253 --> 03:02.388
<i>in the whole,
wide, whole world.</i>

03:02.422 --> 03:04.090
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

03:04.123 --> 03:05.557
You know it. Mmm.

03:06.926 --> 03:08.527
Mmm!

03:08.560 --> 03:10.430
That is unexpectedly hot.

03:10.462 --> 03:11.864
Jeez, that's good.

03:11.898 --> 03:15.001
It's like losing my virginity,
but in my mouth.

03:16.936 --> 03:19.405
Thank you for making
this with such love.

03:19.439 --> 03:20.539
You're welcome.

03:20.572 --> 03:21.707
Officer Johnny!

03:21.740 --> 03:22.942
Have a good one, Guy.

03:22.976 --> 03:26.346
Don't have a good day,
have a great day!

03:26.379 --> 03:28.147
Hold the fudge.

03:28.181 --> 03:31.985
You mean to tell me that nobody snabbed
up those bad boys? Today is the day.

03:32.018 --> 03:34.686
- Like every other day.
- I'll be back for those.

03:40.559 --> 03:42.728
Oh! So close.

03:42.761 --> 03:45.664
Mmm! This is the greatest
cup of coffee of all time.

03:45.697 --> 03:47.265
I wanna write a song about it.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.235
I wanna dance to
that song with my body.

03:49.267 --> 03:50.870
I love my life.

03:50.903 --> 03:52.438
There's something about finding
your lane and just staying in it.

03:52.472 --> 03:54.974
That's why they call 'em comfort
zones, they're so damn comfortable.

03:55.008 --> 03:57.609
Oh, Joe!

03:59.779 --> 04:01.147
Mondays, am I right, Joe?

04:01.180 --> 04:03.182
- You said it, Guy.
- Yeah.

04:05.751 --> 04:09.588
<i>In Free City,
I have everything I need.</i>

04:09.621 --> 04:11.257
Don't have a good day...

04:12.358 --> 04:13.592
have a great day.

04:13.625 --> 04:15.128
Thank you.

04:15.161 --> 04:16.262
Take care.

04:16.295 --> 04:19.031
<i>Except one thing.</i>

04:20.099 --> 04:21.466
Seem happy.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.735
Oh, come on, don't worry about that, Guy.
You gonna find someone.

04:23.769 --> 04:25.271
Oh, it's okay, Bud.

04:25.304 --> 04:28.107
Feel like I've been looking
for her forever, you know?

04:28.141 --> 04:29.641
Maybe it's not meant to be.

04:29.674 --> 04:31.377
Everybody down on the ground!

04:39.052 --> 04:41.387
- I know the woman I'm looking for.
- Oh, let me guess.

04:41.421 --> 04:43.456
- A woman with an offbeat sense of humor.
- Sense of humor.

04:43.489 --> 04:44.824
An obsession
with feel-good diva pop.

04:44.857 --> 04:46.159
Diva pop. Yes, that's her.

04:46.192 --> 04:47.994
She's rented space in my brain
and she won't move out.

04:48.027 --> 04:50.129
And you know what?
I don't want her to.

04:50.163 --> 04:52.799
Well, guess what?
She won't move either in or out.

04:52.832 --> 04:54.434
You know why?
'Cause she doesn't exist.

04:54.467 --> 04:56.536
- She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy.
- That's cruel. You're cruel.

04:56.568 --> 04:58.237
- You're being rotten right now. Rotten.
- I'm being real.

04:58.271 --> 05:01.507
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

05:02.707 --> 05:04.310
So how about it?
Beers on the beach after work?

05:04.343 --> 05:06.578
Of course we're going for
beers on the beach after work.

05:06.611 --> 05:08.081
That makes me so happy.

05:08.114 --> 05:09.182
Me too.

05:21.194 --> 05:22.626
What have you got?

05:22.661 --> 05:24.964
Proof of a secret level.
That's what you're looking for, right?

05:24.997 --> 05:26.765
You got a video
or a screen grab?

05:26.799 --> 05:28.632
Nope. But I know who does.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.937
Wanna know what I do to people
who waste my time?

05:30.970 --> 05:33.605
Oh, wow. Ooh,
someone wants to play.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.575
Hey, you really British,
or is that an accent filter?

05:35.607 --> 05:37.210
'Cause maybe we
could meet up later.

05:37.243 --> 05:41.180
I don't have a burning desire to
see your mum's basement, thanks.

05:41.214 --> 05:42.448
Got jokes, huh?

05:42.482 --> 05:44.784
Well, I got a map,
shows the location of his stash house.

05:44.817 --> 05:49.721
Don't know how you'll get in, but if
you do, clip 56 might interest you.

05:49.754 --> 05:51.923
Now, I got a question.

05:51.958 --> 05:53.459
What's so special
about this video clip anyway?

05:53.493 --> 05:56.829
What's special is I kill people
who ask questions about it.

05:56.863 --> 05:58.831
Mmm, I see. Fun.
Yeah, that's fun.

06:00.932 --> 06:03.369
Damn, girl, you're so feisty.

06:03.402 --> 06:06.305
But seriously, is it loot
or is it just the experience?

06:07.273 --> 06:08.875
Those are questions.

06:10.776 --> 06:13.279
Did you see the sneakers
on that last robber?

06:13.312 --> 06:14.447
The 2:30?

06:14.480 --> 06:16.082
No, the 4:00.

06:16.115 --> 06:19.152
The three-quarter high-top,
gorgeous foam soles.

06:19.185 --> 06:21.354
I could barely feel it
when he stepped on my face.

06:21.387 --> 06:22.721
- Oh, man.
- Wow.

06:22.754 --> 06:25.458
Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.

06:25.491 --> 06:26.591
Give it to me!

06:26.626 --> 06:27.960
Looks like rain.

06:27.994 --> 06:30.329
Has anyone seen my cat?

06:32.632 --> 06:35.001
You know something, Guy,
people say it all the time, like,

06:35.034 --> 06:38.204
"Guy can take a shoe to the face
better than anybody I know."

06:38.237 --> 06:40.940
I mean, when you put it on there,
you act like it's not a shoe in your face.

06:50.883 --> 06:53.052
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

06:53.085 --> 06:54.220
Love that song.

06:57.722 --> 06:59.091
That's a new one.

07:12.205 --> 07:13.206
Hey!

07:15.107 --> 07:16.175
That's her.

07:16.576 --> 07:17.742
Her who?

07:17.777 --> 07:19.679
That's my dream girl, Buddy.

07:19.711 --> 07:21.279
She exists.

07:22.815 --> 07:24.784
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:24.817 --> 07:27.153
Wait, man.
She's wearing sunglasses.

07:27.653 --> 07:29.222
So?

07:29.255 --> 07:30.423
Whatcha mean "so?"

07:30.456 --> 07:32.290
So, people with sunglasses
don't talk to people like us.

07:32.325 --> 07:34.594
- You know that!
- I gotta try.

07:34.627 --> 07:37.196
Look, Guy! Guy!

07:37.230 --> 07:40.066
Guy! What about
beers on the beach?

07:41.867 --> 07:43.402
Excuse me!

07:47.273 --> 07:48.341
Hey!

07:49.941 --> 07:50.942
Hey!

08:01.153 --> 08:03.856
<i>Coming soon...</i> Free City 2!

08:03.889 --> 08:07.627
<i>Bigger! Badder! Radder!</i>

08:07.660 --> 08:09.462
Free City 2: Carnage.

08:09.495 --> 08:11.364
<i>Pre-order today
and get the bonus Mayhem Pack.</i>

08:11.397 --> 08:13.199
You done?

08:13.232 --> 08:15.701
Sorry. Are you closing?

08:15.735 --> 08:16.869
Yes.

08:16.902 --> 08:18.671
We usually don't
put the chairs on the tables,

08:18.704 --> 08:21.140
one-small-coffee-
over-four-hours girl.

08:21.173 --> 08:24.844
You really like that game, huh?
My 12-year-old nephew's addicted.

08:24.877 --> 08:26.712
Seems like everyone's
obsessed with it.

08:26.746 --> 08:29.682
Oh, <i>Free City?</i> Ah. No.

08:29.715 --> 08:32.183
I, uh, have a lawsuit
against the publisher

08:32.217 --> 08:33.986
and the evidence that I need
is in the game.

08:34.020 --> 08:35.488
- So then I had my codes...
- Oh...

08:35.520 --> 08:38.491
I wish we weren't closing so
I could hear more about this.

08:48.734 --> 08:50.236
Good morning, Goldie.

08:55.875 --> 08:58.044
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

08:59.578 --> 09:01.147
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

09:02.515 --> 09:07.620
Actually, I think I'd like
to try a cappuccino today.

09:08.954 --> 09:11.157
Ooh. "Cappuccino."
I enjoy saying that.

09:11.190 --> 09:13.759
It's like a waterfall
made of letters.

09:13.794 --> 09:14.960
Excuse me?

09:14.994 --> 09:17.196
I'd like to try a cappuccino.

09:17.229 --> 09:20.266
- Please.
- But you get a medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

09:20.299 --> 09:22.401
That's what you get.
That's what everyone gets.

09:22.435 --> 09:23.903
Every day. Always.

09:23.935 --> 09:26.138
- Well, I...
- Somebody's about to get shot.

09:27.306 --> 09:28.474
Officer Johnny.

09:28.507 --> 09:31.877
I just thought I'd try something
different today, you know?

09:32.545 --> 09:34.513
Whatever. Right? Yeah?

09:38.184 --> 09:39.185
Hi.

09:41.721 --> 09:43.556
Ha! I'm just keeping
you on your toes.

09:44.623 --> 09:46.859
Coffee, cream,
two sugars, please.

09:46.892 --> 09:48.795
I'm joking.

09:48.829 --> 09:50.797
Just keeping you on your toes.
I was kidding.

09:50.831 --> 09:52.331
He was just kidding!

09:52.365 --> 09:55.534
Oh, you think I'd deprive myself
of your baristic artistry?

09:55.568 --> 09:56.769
No way, no how.

09:56.803 --> 09:59.405
Mmm. That's hot.

09:59.438 --> 10:03.008
It's like Jesus
washed my tongue...

10:03.042 --> 10:05.911
but right before he finished,
he finally told my dad,

10:05.945 --> 10:08.647
"He's good enough."

10:09.682 --> 10:12.551
Thank you so much.
Officer Johnny!

10:12.585 --> 10:13.586
Have a good one, Guy.

10:18.623 --> 10:20.258
Cappuccino.

10:21.293 --> 10:23.195
Don't have a good day...

10:23.896 --> 10:26.031
...have a great day, I guess.

10:27.466 --> 10:30.169
Okay. Good day to you.

10:30.202 --> 10:33.139
Everybody down on the ground!

10:33.172 --> 10:36.008
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.002
That's the girl.

11:03.035 --> 11:04.403
We've been over this.

11:04.437 --> 11:06.071
You tried to talk to her
yesterday, it didn't work.

11:06.105 --> 11:07.740
It will never work.

11:07.774 --> 11:09.041
She's wearing sunglasses.

11:09.074 --> 11:10.509
We don't mess with
the sunglasses people.

11:10.543 --> 11:12.578
Maybe I'll get
some sunglasses of my own.

11:12.611 --> 11:13.914
What? What are you talking about?
You can't do that.

11:13.945 --> 11:15.514
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

11:16.382 --> 11:17.483
Hi.

11:17.516 --> 11:18.651
What'd you say?

11:19.920 --> 11:21.287
Hi.

11:22.221 --> 11:23.790
I'm gonna need
your sunglasses.

11:23.824 --> 11:24.925
Ooh. Ow.

11:24.956 --> 11:26.125
I'm just gonna...

11:26.158 --> 11:27.426
I'm gonna need your
sunglasses for a sec.

11:27.460 --> 11:28.929
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

11:28.961 --> 11:30.095
Go back to your side, man.

11:30.129 --> 11:32.364
He's just an NPC.
Waste that mother...

11:32.398 --> 11:34.200
Okay, just need to borrow them
for a sec, okay?

11:34.233 --> 11:36.769
- Back off! I said, don't!
- Just real quick. Real quick.

11:36.803 --> 11:39.538
Stop!

11:40.239 --> 11:41.842
You broken or somethin'?

11:41.876 --> 11:42.943
I'm the robber!

11:42.975 --> 11:44.743
You're the guy who lies down
and takes it!

11:44.778 --> 11:45.946
Please, just stay down!

11:47.046 --> 11:48.949
I said, stay down!

11:48.981 --> 11:50.316
Guy, you don't do this, man.

11:50.349 --> 11:52.718
This isn't you.

11:52.751 --> 11:54.153
You don't do this.

11:54.855 --> 11:56.722
Maybe I do.

11:56.755 --> 11:59.425
What is wrong with this...

11:59.458 --> 12:00.559
stupid mission?

12:00.593 --> 12:01.894
I told you to smoke his ass.

12:01.928 --> 12:03.028
Let go!

12:03.062 --> 12:04.865
I'll give them right back.

12:04.897 --> 12:06.800
I said...

12:11.470 --> 12:12.571
Guy?

12:17.443 --> 12:18.911
He's just resting.

12:18.945 --> 12:20.012
In pieces!

12:20.045 --> 12:21.714
That man is dead!

12:21.747 --> 12:23.616
He's so sleepy.

12:25.384 --> 12:27.553
I'm just gonna
put your gun down...

12:28.087 --> 12:29.688
right here...

12:29.722 --> 12:31.757
for when you wake.

12:32.625 --> 12:34.059
- Okay?
- Guy.

12:34.794 --> 12:37.296
Guy! Where you goin'?

13:08.427 --> 13:09.562
Excuse me.

13:10.763 --> 13:12.565
Do you see this?

13:12.597 --> 13:15.401
Have the quarterly reports
on my desk by Friday.

13:34.955 --> 13:37.489
Whoo!

13:38.557 --> 13:39.758
Oh!

13:39.793 --> 13:41.160
Giddy up!

13:41.894 --> 13:43.295
I feel brand new.

13:54.841 --> 13:55.875
<i>Loser.</i>

14:05.417 --> 14:06.685
What is happening?

14:09.089 --> 14:11.256
So much money.

14:31.143 --> 14:32.779
Hey, Mouser,
check this out.

14:32.812 --> 14:34.047
What's up, Keys?

14:34.080 --> 14:35.314
What am I looking at?

14:35.347 --> 14:38.084
Okay, so this user,
he gets his glasses stolen

14:38.118 --> 14:39.251
and then killed.

14:39.284 --> 14:41.253
The guy was smoked
by a non-playable character.

14:41.286 --> 14:43.188
An NPC? That's impossible.

14:43.222 --> 14:44.657
Yeah, exactly.

14:44.690 --> 14:46.926
Nobody can equip an NPC skin
on their avatar.

14:46.960 --> 14:51.097
Yeah, so you just boot the trash-ass
noob and ban him for life, you're done.

14:51.131 --> 14:53.265
I tried that, but I...

14:53.298 --> 14:54.968
I can't trace him.

14:55.001 --> 14:58.170
Whoever it is,
they're good.

14:58.203 --> 15:01.540
Hmm. You gotta be better
at your job, buddy.

15:03.009 --> 15:04.110
I'm pretty good.

15:04.144 --> 15:05.310
I'll see you on the inside.

15:05.344 --> 15:06.445
<i>Select your skin.</i>

15:06.478 --> 15:08.480
Hey, Keys, what skin
are you going with?

15:08.514 --> 15:10.349
The ushe.
Dirty stripper cop,

15:10.382 --> 15:11.717
big guns, bigger mustache.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.485
Hmm. Little dirt squirrel.
I like it.

15:13.519 --> 15:15.587
Almost scared to ask,
but what are you going with?

15:15.620 --> 15:19.324
Uh, full body mustache, hot pink.
You should be very afraid.

15:19.358 --> 15:20.893
I'm terrified.

15:20.927 --> 15:22.394
Let's do this.

15:57.864 --> 15:59.264
Seriously, man.

15:59.298 --> 16:02.501
I'm just being honest, I think the
bunny suit is just a little much.

16:03.136 --> 16:05.004
Excuse me?

16:06.739 --> 16:07.974
Right.

16:08.007 --> 16:10.375
Rabbit. Okay? My fault.

16:10.409 --> 16:13.913
Hey, 40-year-old virgin!
Get over here!

16:13.947 --> 16:14.981
Let's go!

16:15.014 --> 16:16.248
Uh-huh.
Captain Khakis.

16:16.281 --> 16:18.283
- Come here. Come on, bud.
- Go, let's go.

16:18.317 --> 16:20.086
- Closer.
- There he is.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.754
Blue shirt guy.

16:22.221 --> 16:23.622
Blue shirt?

16:24.057 --> 16:25.324
Yes.

16:25.758 --> 16:27.392
Hello, Officer.

16:28.527 --> 16:29.394
Rabbit.

16:29.428 --> 16:30.729
Nice skin.

16:30.763 --> 16:33.166
Thank you. That's sweet.

16:33.199 --> 16:34.500
How'd you get it?

16:34.533 --> 16:38.071
Well, uh, mostly genetics,
I think. I'm pretty lucky.

16:38.104 --> 16:39.839
I have naturally dewy skin.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.207
Listen up, Neutrogena.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.342
You know you can't go around looking
like that. The rules are clear.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.609
And another thing.

16:44.643 --> 16:46.146
- You can't hack the NPC avatars.
- No, sir!

16:46.179 --> 16:47.379
- It screws up the mission load...
- Screws it up!

16:47.412 --> 16:48.613
...and it makes
the game look bad.

16:48.647 --> 16:50.083
- Horrible!
- Yeah.

16:50.116 --> 16:52.185
I got, like, 5% of that.

16:52.218 --> 16:53.787
Lose the skin!

16:53.820 --> 16:54.887
I... Lose?

16:54.921 --> 16:56.923
How am I supposed to
get rid of my skin?

16:56.956 --> 16:57.824
Take it off, man.

16:57.857 --> 16:59.391
Just take it off.
What are you doing?

16:59.424 --> 17:00.592
- What?
- Seriously.

17:00.626 --> 17:02.162
- The whole thing. The face, the outfit.
- How?

17:02.195 --> 17:03.395
- Everything. Ditch it.
- Take it off.

17:03.428 --> 17:04.730
If you don't,
we're gonna kill you.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.632
- Why?
- And we're gonna keep killing you.

17:06.665 --> 17:07.598
Still why?

17:07.633 --> 17:09.135
Until we do
find out who you are...

17:09.169 --> 17:10.736
and then we're
gonna ban you for life.

17:10.769 --> 17:14.107
Okay. No, no.
Okay, I want to comply.

17:14.140 --> 17:16.541
I just find the order of
those threats very confusing.

17:16.575 --> 17:18.278
- Somebody's about to get shot.
- Light him up!

17:35.295 --> 17:36.896
No.

17:46.973 --> 17:48.373
Come on, Blue Shirt.

18:08.227 --> 18:11.064
Oh! Didn't see that one coming.
Did you see that one coming?

18:11.097 --> 18:12.298
Scared me a little bit.

18:12.332 --> 18:13.800
We're coming
for you, Blue Shirt!

18:13.833 --> 18:15.301
Coming to get ya.

18:15.335 --> 18:17.036
We're coming to get ya.

18:18.338 --> 18:20.605
Wait! Wait!

18:20.639 --> 18:22.041
I can explain everything.

18:22.075 --> 18:25.878
I found these glasses
and then I can see things now.

18:25.912 --> 18:29.048
Things that... Whoa, whoa.
Things that aren't there.

18:29.082 --> 18:30.582
Except they are there.

18:30.615 --> 18:34.720
I know that sounds crazy,
but it's true!

18:34.753 --> 18:37.991
You can run, Blue Shirt,
but you cannot hide.

18:38.024 --> 18:40.659
Come on, Blue Shirt.
You can't escape the rabbit.

18:40.692 --> 18:42.862
We're apex predators.

18:42.895 --> 18:46.732
All we do is bone and brawl
and slit throats.

18:47.432 --> 18:49.501
Too high! Too high!

18:57.910 --> 19:01.014
Oh, you wanna play,
Blue Shirt? Watch this.

19:01.047 --> 19:05.084
I tire of these games, Keys.
It's time I went god-mode on this beyotch.

19:05.118 --> 19:06.286
Okay, bring it.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.121
Oh, it's brung.
Go, go, go, go, go.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.038
I'm so, so good at this.

19:33.445 --> 19:35.114
Time's up, bank teller!

19:57.036 --> 19:58.171
Nope!

20:22.895 --> 20:23.830
I can't die!

20:23.863 --> 20:25.764
I'm never gonna die!

20:25.798 --> 20:27.000
Whoo!

20:27.033 --> 20:30.103
And that was the heartbreaking
story of Blue Shirt Guy.

20:30.136 --> 20:31.304
The end.

20:31.337 --> 20:33.473
- Doesn't make sense.
- What?

20:33.505 --> 20:35.041
I just checked
the server stats.

20:35.074 --> 20:37.275
We killed Blue Shirt and the number
of players online didn't change.

20:37.310 --> 20:38.378
It's just a glitch, man.

20:38.411 --> 20:39.711
- It's not a big deal.
- I know, I know.

20:39.745 --> 20:41.414
It just seems like that's something
new, you know?

20:41.447 --> 20:43.647
Keys, I know what you're thinking, okay?
You should not talk to Antwan.

20:43.682 --> 20:45.451
I just think it's important
to be transparent, okay?

20:45.485 --> 20:46.918
Uh-uh. No.

20:46.953 --> 20:49.222
Antwan is deep in the sequel launch.
He's either not gonna care

20:49.255 --> 20:52.290
or he's gonna get pissed
and then he's gonna blame us.

20:52.325 --> 20:55.294
So, I don't know what you haven't
figured out about the whole situation.

20:55.328 --> 20:59.832
Also, aren't you some kinda MIT
genius, indie game designer?

20:59.866 --> 21:02.368
What are you doing down here
dealing with complaints?

21:02.402 --> 21:06.571
That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic
story involving failed dreams,

21:06.605 --> 21:08.775
desperation,
and a mountain of college debt.

21:08.808 --> 21:11.044
You do not wanna
hear about that.

21:11.077 --> 21:12.378
You're absolutely right.

21:12.412 --> 21:16.516
That story sounds horrible and
boring and full of white privilege.

21:16.548 --> 21:18.550
Don't talk to Antwan.

21:22.855 --> 21:25.458
<i>We never dreamt
this would've happened.</i>

21:25.491 --> 21:28.161
I mean, <i>Life Itself,</i>
it's essentially a fishbowl game.

21:28.194 --> 21:32.031
People aren't playing it,
they're watching it grow.

21:32.065 --> 21:33.900
It's a strictly
observational experience

21:33.933 --> 21:37.769
where computer generated
characters interact and evolve.

21:37.804 --> 21:39.539
I thought we'd be
lucky to give it away.

21:39.571 --> 21:44.444
That's what's so charming about Keys,
he's clueless about his own genius.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.012
Uh, no, Millie is the genius.

21:46.045 --> 21:49.782
Uh, she built the AI engine
from the ground up.

21:49.816 --> 21:51.184
So, to get a little personal,

21:51.217 --> 21:53.386
what's the thing that
gets you up in the morning?

21:53.419 --> 21:56.055
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

21:57.156 --> 21:58.524
What's the other thing?

21:58.558 --> 22:00.960
Oh, yeah. An insatiable
thirst for validation.

22:00.993 --> 22:02.661
- She's not kidding.
- I'm not.

22:02.694 --> 22:03.930
How about you?

22:03.963 --> 22:05.531
- Code.
- Code?

22:05.565 --> 22:06.598
- Code.
- Code, yeah.

22:06.630 --> 22:08.201
Here we go.

22:08.234 --> 22:10.136
'Cause it's not just zeros and
ones, it's hidden messages.

22:10.169 --> 22:12.538
I like to think of myself, actually,
as not a code writer, but an author.

22:12.572 --> 22:17.176
I just use zeros and ones instead of
words 'cause words will let you down.

22:17.210 --> 22:21.781
But zeros and ones, never.
Zeros and ones are as cool as shit.

22:21.814 --> 22:23.615
- He's not kidding.
- I'm not.

22:23.647 --> 22:25.218
Now, I've gotta ask.

22:25.251 --> 22:27.520
There is a lot of chemistry
between the two of you.

22:27.553 --> 22:30.456
- Has this evolved into more than...
- No.

22:30.490 --> 22:33.126
- No way. No. It's strictly platonic.
- No, no, no. We're friends.

22:33.159 --> 22:34.693
- We're like best friends.
- Friendship.

22:34.726 --> 22:36.129
And now your game is gonna
be released by Soonami,

22:36.162 --> 22:37.797
one of the biggest publishers
in the world.

22:37.830 --> 22:39.799
- <i>It's crazy, actually.</i>
- <i>It is, yeah.</i>

22:39.832 --> 22:42.934
<i>It does seem a little bit like
an unlikely pairing, though.</i>

22:42.969 --> 22:45.037
<i>Yeah, I didn't
totally get it either.</i>

22:45.071 --> 22:47.772
<i>But Millie's got a real
instinct for these things...</i>

22:47.807 --> 22:49.242
<i>Antwan is a genius.</i>

22:49.275 --> 22:52.711
<i>He's brash and obnoxious,
but he's really good at what he does.</i>

22:52.744 --> 22:54.981
<i>It's a chance for our work to
be seen by a wider audience.</i>

22:55.014 --> 22:57.083
- God, those two were young and dumb.
- Jeez.

22:57.116 --> 22:59.118
So we're breaking
and entering now?

22:59.152 --> 23:02.855
How does it feel working for a
galactic black hole of frozen shit?

23:02.889 --> 23:04.956
You have to leave.
I can't talk to you.

23:04.991 --> 23:06.758
Aw, shame will
have that effect.

23:06.792 --> 23:08.361
No, Millie. I mean
I can't talk to you.

23:08.394 --> 23:10.863
I can't even see you. I'm literally
focusing on background objects

23:10.897 --> 23:14.666
because looking at your lips move
violates my NDA and it could get me fired.

23:14.699 --> 23:17.470
Aw, fired by Antwan,
the guy who stole our work?

23:17.503 --> 23:19.172
No, he bought it and
then he shelved it.

23:19.205 --> 23:22.508
All right? You're living in the past.
You are stuck. You gotta move on.

23:22.542 --> 23:23.708
How can I move on?

23:23.742 --> 23:25.144
How can you?

23:25.178 --> 23:28.147
Antwan swiped our AI engine
to use in his dumb shooter.

23:28.181 --> 23:31.851
Did he, Millie?
Because honestly, I'm not so sure.

23:31.884 --> 23:34.420
Our game was complex
and beautiful and interesting

23:34.453 --> 23:37.957
and <i>Free City,</i> it may be popular,
but it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.

23:37.990 --> 23:39.959
Then stop defending him
and help me beat his ass.

23:39.992 --> 23:42.694
- Millie, I'm...
- Come on, Keys, he stole from us.

23:42.727 --> 23:44.363
And now he's lying about it

23:44.397 --> 23:46.399
so he doesn't have to give us the credit
and the royalties that we deserve.

23:46.432 --> 23:47.766
Millie...

23:47.800 --> 23:50.002
I found a clue.
It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house.

23:50.036 --> 23:53.639
All I need from you
is to get me in there.

23:53.673 --> 23:56.075
Millie, I care about you...

24:00.580 --> 24:02.181
but you need to leave.

24:10.256 --> 24:12.458
Today is gonna
be different, Goldie.

25:13.618 --> 25:14.987
What are we lookin' at?

25:15.554 --> 25:17.757
Who are you?

25:17.790 --> 25:19.458
Okay, okay. Okay.

25:19.492 --> 25:22.061
We ran into each other the other day,
you were humming that great song.

25:22.094 --> 25:23.029
Oh, yeah.

25:23.062 --> 25:25.798
I thought you were an NPC.
How did you find me?

25:25.831 --> 25:28.834
I waited outside
by the murder train,

25:28.868 --> 25:30.369
then I followed you.

25:30.403 --> 25:31.404
Shit!

25:46.852 --> 25:48.187
Should I come with you?

25:49.522 --> 25:50.589
Yes.

25:51.957 --> 25:54.260
Holy hell, what just happened?

25:54.293 --> 25:57.029
What just happened
is you almost blew my mission.

25:57.063 --> 26:00.333
No, I mean, how did we get
from there to wherever this is?

26:00.366 --> 26:01.933
You mean the portal gun?

26:01.967 --> 26:03.736
Portal gun?
That sounds expensive.

26:03.769 --> 26:05.971
Wow, you are a
special kind of noob.

26:06.005 --> 26:07.340
Thank you. You too.

26:07.373 --> 26:08.474
Turn around.

26:08.507 --> 26:10.509
Okay.

26:13.780 --> 26:14.980
Oh.

26:18.984 --> 26:20.585
Is this the North Pole?

26:20.619 --> 26:22.054
Listen, dude.

26:22.088 --> 26:23.824
- Guy.
- Guy. Whatever.

26:23.856 --> 26:25.524
Props on the NPC outfit,

26:25.558 --> 26:28.394
but I'm busy trying to figure
out how to steal something.

26:28.427 --> 26:30.329
Maybe I could help you.

26:30.363 --> 26:31.497
I work alone.

26:31.530 --> 26:32.932
You have beautiful grenades.

26:32.965 --> 26:35.935
Besides, if you want to have any
chance of making an impact here,

26:35.968 --> 26:38.037
you need to have
a higher level than that.

26:38.070 --> 26:39.905
- That's tough. No.
- No.

26:40.506 --> 26:41.540
Higher level?

26:41.574 --> 26:42.942
Good Lord, rook.

26:44.577 --> 26:45.644
See?

26:45.678 --> 26:47.646
- Oh.
- That's mine.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.415
And that's yours.

26:49.448 --> 26:53.787
Oh... What, is one the best
or the worst?

26:53.820 --> 26:55.321
There is literally
nothing lower.

26:55.354 --> 26:57.456
Well, how do I get
to a higher level?

26:57.490 --> 26:59.425
- Really?
- Really.

27:00.192 --> 27:03.629
- You know, get stuff.
- Yeah.

27:03.662 --> 27:05.664
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Okay.

27:05.698 --> 27:06.932
- Experience, guns...
- Yeah.

27:06.966 --> 27:08.000
- Put that down.
- Uh-huh.

27:08.033 --> 27:10.469
Money. This is Free City.

27:10.503 --> 27:12.605
You could rob a store,
carjack someone,

27:12.638 --> 27:15.007
punch a pedestrian in the face.
You'll figure it out.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.576
Oh, I'd never hurt innocent people.

27:19.912 --> 27:23.916
Hmm. I've got to admit
that is kind of refreshing.

27:23.949 --> 27:28.120
Sometimes I forget not everyone you
meet on here is a sociopathic man-child.

27:29.287 --> 27:30.356
Thank you.

27:30.389 --> 27:33.058
Wait. But the world
isn't that bad though, is it?

27:33.092 --> 27:36.362
Oh! It's pretty bleak.

27:36.395 --> 27:39.098
If you ever met the dick responsible
for this world, you'd agree.

27:39.131 --> 27:42.968
Are we talking about God?
You've met God?

27:43.804 --> 27:45.171
And he's a dick?

27:45.204 --> 27:48.040
His name's Antwan, and yes,
he's an absolute troll.

27:48.507 --> 27:49.776
Trolls exist?

27:50.877 --> 27:53.379
Look, I don't know
if anybody does it,

27:53.412 --> 27:56.382
but you could rack experience
points up by being a good guy.

27:56.415 --> 27:58.451
- Like a hero.
- Ooh. Easy, tiger.

27:58.484 --> 28:00.753
If you don't wanna shoot people,
you could steal their guns.

28:00.787 --> 28:02.388
All that shit makes
your level go up.

28:02.421 --> 28:03.824
Go be the good guy.

28:03.857 --> 28:05.124
Okay. No, I'm gonna
be the great guy.

28:05.157 --> 28:06.459
Ooh! Ooh.

28:06.492 --> 28:08.829
Okay, well, enjoy your
lifetime supply of virginity.

28:08.862 --> 28:10.162
Off you go.

28:10.196 --> 28:12.198
Okay. Wait! How will I know
that I've leveled up enough?

28:12.231 --> 28:15.067
- Uh, get over 100, then we'll talk.
- Whoa.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.102
- Bye now.
- That's so much more than one.

28:17.136 --> 28:18.471
- It's like 99 more...
- Bye now.

28:18.504 --> 28:19.505
Okay.

28:57.376 --> 28:58.444
Hi.

29:26.539 --> 29:27.606
Thanks, Guy.

29:47.861 --> 29:49.061
Good morning, Goldie.

29:49.796 --> 29:51.430
Good morning, Goldie.

29:51.463 --> 29:53.299
Good fucking morning, Goldie.

29:53.332 --> 29:56.970
<i>I have three words for you.
Blue Shirt Guy.</i>

29:57.003 --> 30:01.841
<i>BSG is leveling up and at a
record pace by playing the hero.</i>

30:01.876 --> 30:05.544
<i>It's got people all over the world
asking, "Just who is this guy?"</i>

30:05.578 --> 30:09.315
I don't know who this guy is,
but he's out-skilling all these players.

30:09.348 --> 30:11.083
<i>And here he is,
taking out Beefoven,</i>

30:15.187 --> 30:16.355
<i>I don't know, but he's good.</i>

30:16.388 --> 30:18.657
<i>Yeah, he's good.
He looks like an NPC</i>

30:18.691 --> 30:21.226

30:28.868 --> 30:30.569
- Piper.
- Who is Blue Shirt Guy?

30:30.603 --> 30:31.972
You're absolutely right.

30:32.005 --> 30:37.043
Blue Shirt Guy.
Who is he or she indeed?

30:50.522 --> 30:53.258
Whoo-hoo!

31:01.861 --> 31:05.657
There's a worldwide craze that has
captured kids' hearts-- Blue Shirt Guy!

31:06.282 --> 31:07.367
Hello, Hinata.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.536
You have a great outfit.

31:09.786 --> 31:10.954
Don't have a good day,

31:11.162 --> 31:12.539
Have a GREAT day!

31:12.705 --> 31:15.458
Crazy awesome!!!

31:56.422 --> 31:59.993
Well, well, well. Look who decided
to come to work today, huh?

32:00.026 --> 32:02.594
Look, where have you been?
I've been worried sick about you...

32:03.629 --> 32:04.763
What is this shirt?

32:04.798 --> 32:06.298
Where's your collar at?
Where's the rest of the buttons?

32:07.167 --> 32:08.802
And it's not tucked in.
You look sloppy.

32:08.835 --> 32:11.670
Matter of fact, you look horrible.
Did you pick up some muscles, too?

32:11.704 --> 32:13.173
Or is somebody outside
pumping you up?

32:13.205 --> 32:16.208
I'm sorry that I haven't
been around, Bud.

32:16.241 --> 32:17.676
I've been figuring
some stuff out.

32:17.710 --> 32:20.847
Whatcha mean, "figure stuff out"?
It is nothing to figure out.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.715
Okay? You go to bed,
you wake up,

32:22.748 --> 32:24.516
you get some coffee,
then you come to work.

32:24.550 --> 32:26.251
And then you repeat
the same thing tomorrow.

32:26.284 --> 32:28.154
- The girl.
- Oh, my God.

32:28.188 --> 32:29.455
I talked to her.
I talked to her.

32:29.488 --> 32:32.158
- The one with the sunglasses?
- The sunglasses, yes!

32:32.192 --> 32:33.893
I talked to one of
the sunglass people

32:33.927 --> 32:36.796
and now I'm one of the sunglass people.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.297
Me.

32:38.330 --> 32:40.033
Everybody down
on the ground!

32:40.066 --> 32:41.500
You're so hot.

32:41.533 --> 32:44.470
What if I could tell you
that you could be more?

32:44.503 --> 32:45.939
Your life could be fuller.

32:45.972 --> 32:48.174
That you're free to make your
own decisions. Your own choices.

32:48.209 --> 32:49.241
Yo, dumbass.

32:49.274 --> 32:50.777
We are in the middle
of something.

32:51.343 --> 32:52.578
Uh...

32:52.611 --> 32:55.214
- That's my gun.
- Quiet time.

32:55.247 --> 32:58.650
These puppies changed my life.
And they're gonna change yours, too.

32:58.684 --> 33:00.619
Come on now,
you know we don't wear sunglasses.

33:02.521 --> 33:04.456
We do now.

33:06.025 --> 33:07.093
<i>Mine now.</i>

33:07.127 --> 33:08.660
Are you kidding me?

33:10.964 --> 33:12.698
- Put 'em on.
- No.

33:12.731 --> 33:14.868
Life doesn't have to be something
that just happens to us. All right?

33:14.901 --> 33:17.971
Just put the glasses on
and you're gonna see.

33:18.004 --> 33:19.671
You're gonna see.

33:22.909 --> 33:23.977
Come on.

33:25.011 --> 33:26.478
I can't, okay?

33:28.347 --> 33:29.614
I'm sorry.

33:36.355 --> 33:38.258
I'm keeping these,
asshole mouth.

33:38.290 --> 33:40.794
Now get out of here.
Go be nicer.

33:40.827 --> 33:42.862
Beat it. Go, go, go.

33:42.895 --> 33:44.496
Don't walk, run.

33:45.064 --> 33:46.866
And you...

33:46.899 --> 33:48.001
Ugh.

33:48.034 --> 33:49.735
Sorry.

33:49.768 --> 33:53.072
Um, you could do so much
better than that guy.

33:53.106 --> 33:56.375
You could be with,
like, a good guy.

33:57.309 --> 33:59.611
Or maybe I don't have
to be with any guy.

33:59.645 --> 34:02.248
Right? Exactly.
Most of them are awful.

34:02.282 --> 34:04.083
- They really are.
- Terrible.

34:04.117 --> 34:05.484
Yeah, do whatever
you wanna do.

34:12.724 --> 34:14.359
You're my best friend, Buddy.

34:14.393 --> 34:16.695
And you don't
have to be scared.

34:16.728 --> 34:19.665
If you change your mind,
I'll be around.

34:25.670 --> 34:28.107
Yo, Keys, our
Blue Shirt Guy is everywhere.

34:29.074 --> 34:30.176
I know.

34:30.208 --> 34:31.677
Who is this guy?

35:00.739 --> 35:02.308
I'm here.

35:02.342 --> 35:04.077
<i>I really appreciate
this, Keys.</i>

35:04.110 --> 35:05.979
Okay. Just to be clear,

35:06.012 --> 35:08.982
all I'm doing right now
is opening the door.

35:09.015 --> 35:12.384
If this clip really does prove that
Antwan reused our code illegally,

35:12.417 --> 35:13.618
go find it and get out.

35:14.821 --> 35:19.125
Player's doing the jewelry
store mission in midtown.

35:19.158 --> 35:20.726
That gives you 5 minutes.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.463
<i>And go.</i>

35:33.438 --> 35:35.975
Keys, you're a goddamn genius.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.243
<i>Really?</i>

35:37.277 --> 35:38.644
I'm sitting on the toilet right
now, stealing user codes,

35:38.677 --> 35:40.512
so I don't exactly
feel like one.

35:40.545 --> 35:41.981
Oh, you never have.

35:42.015 --> 35:44.150
Good thing I know better.

35:44.183 --> 35:47.552
<i>All right. The clip you're looking
for should be on the wall to your left.</i>

35:47.586 --> 35:49.488
- Thanks for the assist.
- <i>You got it.</i>

35:49.521 --> 35:51.057
<i>I hope it has the proof
you're looking for.</i>

36:16.149 --> 36:17.817
Keys! I need your help!

36:17.850 --> 36:19.651
He's got that place
booby-trapped with spawn points.

36:19.685 --> 36:20.954
Millie, I can't help you.

36:42.474 --> 36:43.675
Blue Shirt Guy?

36:43.709 --> 36:47.579
It's a Henley. Was that cool?
It felt really cool.

36:47.612 --> 36:51.050
You look really pretty.
Wow, this house is so nice.

36:58.557 --> 37:00.026
What are you doing here?

37:00.059 --> 37:02.761
I was trying to steal a video
clip, now we're trying not to die.

37:03.729 --> 37:04.931
Who are you talking to?

37:06.665 --> 37:10.136
You know, that player
in the NPC skin.

37:10.169 --> 37:12.537
Millie, there are no other
players in that house.

37:13.705 --> 37:16.042
That actually hurt my hand.

37:16.075 --> 37:17.143
Get down!

38:05.825 --> 38:08.895
I'm sorry!
Oh, God!

38:13.299 --> 38:14.699
We're doing great.

38:26.345 --> 38:27.447
Wow!

38:29.648 --> 38:31.150
We should definitely go!

38:32.617 --> 38:33.886
Oh, shit!

38:40.993 --> 38:43.296
- Is that a Glock in your pocket?
- No.

38:43.329 --> 38:45.263
- What?
- It's two Glocks.

38:46.365 --> 38:47.631
Oh!

39:19.866 --> 39:21.968
I don't suppose
this thing can fly.

39:22.001 --> 39:23.236
No.

39:23.269 --> 39:24.337
Jump.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.205
Wow!

39:27.306 --> 39:30.076
Whoa!

39:38.184 --> 39:39.684
Oh, shit.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.202
Good morning, sheeple!

39:56.235 --> 39:57.837
Oh, you are fired.

39:57.870 --> 40:00.273
There is some concern with the bloody
zombies, retailers won't carry the game.

40:00.306 --> 40:02.041
Cut it. It's out.
Never even happened. Next.

40:02.074 --> 40:03.242
It's your lawyers.
They need to get your deposition...

40:03.276 --> 40:06.045
Speak. Which lawsuit
are we talking about?

40:06.078 --> 40:08.781
Millie, Millie Rusk?
No sweat.

40:08.814 --> 40:10.416
That will never see
the inside of a courtroom...

40:10.449 --> 40:13.618
because she's got no proof and
her ex-partner works for me.

40:13.653 --> 40:14.686
We're golden.

40:14.719 --> 40:16.222
Antwan, hey. You look great.

40:16.254 --> 40:17.823
Uh, I thought you were
still at Burning Man.

40:17.857 --> 40:20.359
Oh, does it look like
I'm still at Burning Man?

40:20.393 --> 40:21.460
You, you, you...

40:21.494 --> 40:23.596
No. So, shut your stupid,
bearded face and listen.

40:23.629 --> 40:26.399
You heard about the asshole running
around in the game who looks like an NPC?

40:26.432 --> 40:29.202
Yeah, yeah. We call him Blue Shirt Guy.
But we're gonna get rid of him.

40:29.235 --> 40:32.672
Don't get rid of him. People like him.
It's all over social media. No.

40:32.704 --> 40:35.808
In fact, know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna use the skin in <i>Free City 2.</i>

40:35.841 --> 40:39.345
Oh, art nerds! We're gonna make some
upgrades to Blue Shirt, all right?

40:39.378 --> 40:41.414
'Roid him out. Make him
a hitman or something.

40:41.447 --> 40:44.584
Antwan, we're already way behind
porting over the skins from <i>Free City 1.</i>

40:44.617 --> 40:46.118
Skins?
Don't even worry about that.

40:46.152 --> 40:47.954
They won't be usable
in <i>Free City 2.</i>

40:47.987 --> 40:49.721
Antwan, you told the fans...

40:49.754 --> 40:51.557
<i>Free City 2</i> is backwards compatible.
It was in the commercial.

40:51.591 --> 40:53.925
You said there'd be the same
characters in the sequel.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.330
Well, here's the thing.
When I said that, I was lying.

40:57.363 --> 40:59.832
Listen, Antwan, the game
is already buggier than ever.

40:59.865 --> 41:01.434
I got a stack of user
complaints, like a mile high.

41:01.467 --> 41:03.069
Look, I know it sucks.

41:03.102 --> 41:07.406
But the IP recognition is rock hard.
Okay? So don't even worry about it.

41:07.440 --> 41:10.710
I'm just saying,
we could make an original game.

41:10.742 --> 41:12.245
What?

41:12.278 --> 41:14.513
Make an original? Why would I do
that when I could make a sequel?

41:14.547 --> 41:15.581
A sequel.

41:15.615 --> 41:16.983
So we can make it better?

41:17.016 --> 41:19.885
IPs and sequels,
that is the thing that people want.

41:19.919 --> 41:21.153
- Let me ask you a question.
- Okay.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.722
You love Kentucky
Fried Chicken, right?

41:22.754 --> 41:24.323
- Mmm-hmm.
- No.

41:24.357 --> 41:26.859
If you love Kentucky Fried Chicken,
and I make Kentucky Fried Chicken,

41:26.892 --> 41:28.894
and I know that you love
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

41:28.928 --> 41:30.429
why would I make
another restaurant called,

41:30.463 --> 41:32.865
uh, I don't know,
"Albuquerque Boiled Turkey"?

41:32.898 --> 41:34.766
- Okay? Makes no sense, homie.
- Mmm-hmm. No sense.

41:34.800 --> 41:39.038
What am I gonna give you? A sequel.
Kentucky Fried Chicken-Chicken, Part Two.

41:39.071 --> 41:41.474
Uh, yum.
Drop the deuce on him.

41:41.507 --> 41:43.776
Come on. Come here. Come here.

41:43.809 --> 41:45.244
I don't want you to stress

41:45.278 --> 41:47.313
that glorious shampoo commercial
head of yours about it.

41:47.346 --> 41:50.783
<i>Free City 2</i> is gonna
be jumunjious.

41:50.816 --> 41:52.818
That's not a word.

41:54.220 --> 41:56.254
You sure you don't wanna
bump up to programming?

41:56.289 --> 41:59.125
I know you got
the brains for it.

41:59.158 --> 42:01.560
No thanks. I'm good
right where I am.

42:03.396 --> 42:08.000
Love it. Fear of flying.
Can't say I can relate.

42:08.034 --> 42:10.503
But all good with me if I
don't have to pay you more.

42:10.536 --> 42:12.171
Antwan out.

42:22.783 --> 42:24.350
Who is this guy?

42:32.558 --> 42:33.659
Wow!

42:33.693 --> 42:35.328
I took your advice.

42:37.263 --> 42:38.431
I leveled up.

42:39.365 --> 42:40.833
Impressive.

42:42.268 --> 42:44.370
Why are you
doing all of this?

42:44.403 --> 42:48.541
You know, I guess
I felt... trapped.

42:49.608 --> 42:51.310
You know, in my life.

42:51.344 --> 42:53.379
I just felt so...

42:53.746 --> 42:55.214
Stuck.

42:56.615 --> 42:59.985
Yeah. And then I saw you.

43:01.354 --> 43:03.189
Then I saw you.

43:03.955 --> 43:05.257
Who are you?

43:05.858 --> 43:07.093
I'm Guy.

43:07.126 --> 43:09.395
No, who are you really?

43:09.428 --> 43:10.262
Still Guy.

43:10.296 --> 43:15.101
All of this,
leveling up so fast.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.703
Giving this whole
world the finger.

43:17.737 --> 43:19.038
How are you pulling this off?

43:19.071 --> 43:22.074
I've never given anyone
any of my fingers.

43:22.108 --> 43:23.943
You work at Soonami, don't you?

43:23.976 --> 43:25.779
- No.
- You've got an inside track.

43:25.812 --> 43:27.513
- I work at the bank.
- Right. The bank.

43:27.546 --> 43:31.884
So, you're just this incredible hacker
who happens to work at the bank.

43:31.917 --> 43:33.486
Yes, I work at the bank.

43:33.519 --> 43:35.654
Where did you get that skin?

43:36.823 --> 43:38.557
It's always
sort of been there.

43:38.591 --> 43:40.993
Why do people keep
asking me that question?

43:41.026 --> 43:43.028
I don't know, why do they?

43:46.065 --> 43:49.201
No, no.
Not doing that. I...

43:50.102 --> 43:51.670
What's happening right now?

43:51.704 --> 43:53.639
I don't know,
but I don't buy it.

43:53.672 --> 43:55.007
No.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.976
- Okay, fine. I'll forget it.
- Fine. Good.

43:57.009 --> 43:58.444
- I'll let it go.
- Yes.

43:58.879 --> 44:00.112
Great.

44:00.146 --> 44:01.714
We all have
our secrets, I guess.

44:01.747 --> 44:03.416
Yes, we do.

44:06.152 --> 44:07.153
Hey.

44:08.621 --> 44:10.556
Do you like ice cream?

44:10.589 --> 44:13.827
I can't believe
I've never been here.

44:13.860 --> 44:15.761
Well, it's sort of a secret.

44:15.796 --> 44:19.565
That's why me and my buddy, Buddy,
always come here. It's quiet and safe.

44:19.598 --> 44:21.300
Yeah, it makes sense.

44:22.468 --> 44:25.070
No missions here.

44:25.104 --> 44:28.407
Oh, you gotta try this.
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

44:28.441 --> 44:30.042
This is my favorite flavor
in the whole world.

44:30.075 --> 44:31.210
We'll take two
of the usual, please.

44:31.243 --> 44:32.545
You got it, Guy.

44:32.578 --> 44:34.647
It's bubble gum flavor.

44:34.680 --> 44:36.482
You think I'm
crazy, don't you?

44:36.515 --> 44:37.584
Guy...

44:37.616 --> 44:40.753
Get out of my brain hole!
I love bubble gum ice cream.

44:40.787 --> 44:42.755
No, you don't.
Are you making fun of me right now?

44:42.789 --> 44:45.257
No! Nobody likes
bubble gum ice cream.

44:45.291 --> 44:46.358
No, I do.

44:46.392 --> 44:47.794
I had a relationship end
over bubble gum ice cream.

44:47.828 --> 44:49.061
- No way. Here.
- Yeah.

44:49.094 --> 44:50.729
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

44:50.763 --> 44:52.031
Mmm.

44:52.064 --> 44:53.432
How good is that?

44:53.466 --> 44:54.599
You can taste it?

44:54.633 --> 44:58.304
Taste it? It's like my tongue
had a baby with a sunrise.

44:58.337 --> 44:59.638
- Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm.

45:00.941 --> 45:02.776
Coffee used to be
my favorite food,

45:02.809 --> 45:05.377
but compared to this,
it tastes like liquid suffering.

45:05.411 --> 45:07.480
What?

45:10.216 --> 45:13.118
Nothing. You're funny.

45:14.353 --> 45:15.789
- I am?
- Yeah.

45:15.822 --> 45:18.256
Weird funny.

45:18.290 --> 45:20.893
But that's kind of my speed.

45:20.927 --> 45:23.062
Weird funny, that's
totally my speed, too.

45:23.095 --> 45:25.097
- Great.
- Yeah. I know a joke.

45:25.130 --> 45:26.732
A weird funny joke.
You wanna hear it?

45:26.765 --> 45:28.501
- Please.
- Okay.

45:28.534 --> 45:33.239
A homosexual and a man in a wheelchair
are trying to murder a very small child...

45:33.271 --> 45:35.809
- The cripple says to the homosexual...
- Whoa. Stop, stop.

45:35.842 --> 45:38.010
Stop! Where did you hear that?

45:38.043 --> 45:40.546
A robbery. The gunman
told it to the driver

45:40.579 --> 45:43.916
who thought it was hilarious,
so I memorized it and told everyone.

45:43.950 --> 45:45.718
Word of advice?

45:45.751 --> 45:49.021
Don't crib your jokes
from the trolls of <i>Free City.</i>

45:49.054 --> 45:50.155
Trolls?

45:50.189 --> 45:51.657
Is that a swing set?

46:16.917 --> 46:18.317
Holy...

46:26.225 --> 46:28.561
Okay, this is too weird.

46:28.593 --> 46:31.664
Vintage Mariah, bubble gum ice
cream, and now swings?

46:31.697 --> 46:34.133
- This is too weird.
- I thought the same thing, too.

46:34.166 --> 46:35.568
I thought the same thing.

46:35.600 --> 46:38.737
When I was younger,
I was obsessed with swings.

46:40.139 --> 46:42.141
<i>Growing up in
my family, it was...</i>

46:42.174 --> 46:44.911
You don't
wanna hear this. No.

46:44.945 --> 46:47.079
Oh, I wanna hear everything.

46:47.112 --> 46:48.747
Oh.

46:48.782 --> 46:52.117
Growing up in my family,
it wasn't good enough to be great.

46:52.151 --> 46:55.989
You had to win,
and that pressure, you know,

46:56.022 --> 46:58.524
<i>it was just constant.</i>

46:58.557 --> 47:02.094
But when I was in the backyard
on that little swing...

47:02.127 --> 47:03.362
You know that moment,

47:03.395 --> 47:07.333
<i>that split second between
rising and falling,</i>

47:07.366 --> 47:09.568
when you're totally weightless,
it feels like you're free.

47:09.602 --> 47:10.636
In love.

47:10.669 --> 47:12.839
Free. What you said. Yeah.

47:15.608 --> 47:17.811
I really wanna kiss you.
Is that weird?

47:19.079 --> 47:20.512
You want to kiss me?

47:22.015 --> 47:24.216
I wanna kiss you so badly.

47:24.249 --> 47:25.718
You want to kiss me badly?

47:25.751 --> 47:27.152
- No!
- No?

47:27.186 --> 47:29.089
No, no, no, no, no.
I wanna kiss you well.

47:29.121 --> 47:30.656
I mean, I'm an idiot,

47:30.689 --> 47:32.358
so I say things
like an idiot sometimes.

47:32.391 --> 47:33.927
No, you're not. You're not.

47:33.960 --> 47:35.394
I mean, um,

47:36.295 --> 47:38.865
uh, if you know
how to, go for it.

47:38.898 --> 47:40.232
I know how.

47:41.433 --> 47:42.434
Okay.

47:44.570 --> 47:46.171
Here it goes.

48:08.160 --> 48:12.665
That was so much
better than ice cream.

48:12.698 --> 48:14.034
Whoa!

48:14.067 --> 48:15.701
I think someone's
at the door.

48:15.734 --> 48:16.836
I'll say.

48:16.870 --> 48:18.603
Well, this was great.

48:18.637 --> 48:21.876
- Yeah, it was.
- Let's meet up again sometime soon. Yeah?

48:21.908 --> 48:23.843
Yes. Definitely.

48:23.876 --> 48:25.477
Maybe in the real world.

48:25.511 --> 48:26.913
What?

48:26.946 --> 48:28.347
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:28.380 --> 48:29.882
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

48:31.183 --> 48:33.119
Bye, Molotov.

48:33.153 --> 48:37.222
Hey... my real name is Millie.

48:38.223 --> 48:42.227
My real name
continues to be Guy.

48:48.935 --> 48:51.805
Millie, open up! Millie, it's
me, it's Keys! Open up! Come on!

48:51.838 --> 48:54.907
Millie! It's me, open up!

48:54.941 --> 48:57.309
- What?
- You were right.

48:57.342 --> 48:59.344
- You were right.
- Oh, come on in.

48:59.378 --> 49:02.015
You were right.
Our code, it is in <i>Free City</i>

49:02.048 --> 49:04.717
and, Millie, it works.

49:04.750 --> 49:06.452
Yeah, I know.
But we don't have proof.

49:06.485 --> 49:08.520
Just forget about
that for one second.

49:08.554 --> 49:10.790
I'm saying that
our game, <i>Life Itself,</i>

49:10.824 --> 49:13.960
where characters would grow
and change and feel real...

49:13.993 --> 49:15.161
- Yeah?
- ...worked.

49:15.195 --> 49:16.930
- Keys.
- The AI worked.

49:16.963 --> 49:20.399
It's the reason why <i>Free City</i> is so
realistic and people love it so much.

49:20.432 --> 49:22.434
And of course it doesn't
look the same.

49:22.468 --> 49:25.404
There's no waterfalls,
there's no butterflies and unicorns,

49:25.437 --> 49:28.174
all the characters have different skins.
Of course they do.

49:28.209 --> 49:33.046
But the underlying code in the
game is the same. Our code.

49:33.079 --> 49:34.713
And Guy, I mean,
he has evolved way further

49:34.747 --> 49:36.149
than we thought
was even possible.

49:36.182 --> 49:38.450
Wait, are you talking about
the hacker in the NPC skin?

49:38.484 --> 49:42.122
Millie, I'm talking about the
fact that Blue Shirt Guy...

49:42.155 --> 49:43.255
Yeah?

49:43.288 --> 49:45.125
...is not a player.

49:45.158 --> 49:48.128
He is an algorithm
who thinks he's alive.

49:48.161 --> 49:50.362
I mean, hell,
technically, he is alive.

49:50.395 --> 49:54.666
He is the first real
artificial intelligence.

49:56.035 --> 49:57.937
- No! No.
- I know.

49:57.971 --> 49:59.371
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

49:59.404 --> 50:01.007
- Guy? My Guy?
- Guy.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.274
- One who has been...
- Your Guy?

50:02.307 --> 50:03.709
- Holy...
- This is a good thing.

50:03.742 --> 50:05.111
No, it's really bad.

50:05.145 --> 50:08.714
Millie, his code, it's thousands
of times the size it should be.

50:08.747 --> 50:10.883
We did it, Mills.

50:10.917 --> 50:14.954
We did it. Everything that we wanted
to create, it actually happened.

50:14.988 --> 50:18.825
Okay? Did you know that the
NPCs have private lives?

50:18.858 --> 50:21.060
One of the baristas learned how to make
a cappuccino through trial and error.

50:21.094 --> 50:23.428
I mean, that's really difficult.
I can't even do that.

50:23.462 --> 50:25.697
I can't even froth my own
oat milk in the morning.

50:25.731 --> 50:28.234
And the Bombshell
character in the game

50:28.268 --> 50:31.137
wrote a memoir that's
a searing indictment

50:31.171 --> 50:32.839
of gender roles,
the patriarchy...

50:32.872 --> 50:35.008
It's a little preachy in parts,
but overall, it's pretty good.

50:35.041 --> 50:36.375
Millie, we have to celebrate!

50:36.408 --> 50:37.877
- No, this can't be happening.
- What are you talking about?

50:37.910 --> 50:40.712
- This is what we've been working for!
- No, I let him kiss me!

50:42.115 --> 50:43.682
So, yeah.

50:46.820 --> 50:48.720
I'm sorry, wait,
you let who kiss you?

50:48.754 --> 50:49.789
Guy.

50:50.890 --> 50:52.091
Guy?

50:52.125 --> 50:56.628
The first time I kiss a
non-toxic guy in like forever

50:56.662 --> 50:59.464
and of course
he's not even real!

50:59.498 --> 51:00.967
Uh, there's not
a button for that.

51:01.868 --> 51:03.335
Oh, he found the button.

51:03.368 --> 51:04.770
- Okay.
- Yeah.

51:04.804 --> 51:07.339
- I am... I'm so confused.
- Why is it so hot?

51:07.372 --> 51:09.210
And surprisingly curious.

51:09.242 --> 51:12.846
You let an artificially intelligent

51:12.879 --> 51:14.513
- video game character kiss you?
- Oh, okay,

51:14.546 --> 51:15.581
can you just stop
saying it like that?

51:15.614 --> 51:16.682
And then you
thought that would be...

51:16.715 --> 51:18.483
Because you have
got to meet him, Keys.

51:18.517 --> 51:21.586
He's funny, and he's sweet,
and he's so handsome.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.923
Oh, my God,
now I'm saying it out loud.

51:23.957 --> 51:28.094
Also, Millie, food for
thought, he's like four.

51:29.262 --> 51:30.897
- Really? You're gonna do that?
- Really.

51:30.930 --> 51:32.832
Wow, you just made
that really creepy.

51:34.334 --> 51:36.435
Millie, put all that aside. Weird or
not, when people find out about this,

51:36.468 --> 51:39.238
you could win a Nobel Prize.
Oh, God.

51:39.272 --> 51:40.306
What?

51:40.340 --> 51:42.241
Oh, my God,
if they see this...

51:42.275 --> 51:43.508
- What? What is it?
- Oh!

51:43.542 --> 51:45.510
Antwan. What else?

51:45.544 --> 51:47.981
He's lying.
He lied about using our code,

51:48.014 --> 51:50.382
he's been lying about the game
being backwards compatible.

51:50.415 --> 51:51.918
I think he's lying
about <i>Free City 1.</i>

51:51.951 --> 51:53.219
What are you talking about?

51:53.253 --> 51:56.823
Look. You see? There's not
one mission, not one location...

51:56.856 --> 51:59.259
I mean, there's not even a single
character from <i>Free City 1</i> on here.

51:59.292 --> 52:00.726
<i>Free City 2</i>
is not an update...

52:00.759 --> 52:02.295
- It's a replacement.
- Exactly.

52:02.328 --> 52:03.963
So when <i>Free City 2</i>
launches on Monday...

52:03.997 --> 52:07.499
Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our
code, everything will be deleted.

52:07.532 --> 52:09.235
He can't do that.

52:09.269 --> 52:12.404
I mean, this is artificial life we're
dealing with. I mean, that's insane.

52:15.908 --> 52:17.043
We're screwed.

52:17.810 --> 52:19.611
Maybe not.

52:19.645 --> 52:21.881
If we can find our
original build in the game,

52:21.914 --> 52:24.750
it'll prove that Antwan used our
code without properly licensing it.

52:24.784 --> 52:27.220
And we just have to find it
before <i>Free City 2</i> launches.

52:27.253 --> 52:28.553
We have 48 hours.

52:28.587 --> 52:30.223
I've looked, Keys.
You know I have.

52:30.256 --> 52:31.490
I know you have.

52:31.523 --> 52:34.093
But now that we both know
about Blue Shirt Guy,

52:34.127 --> 52:35.627
maybe he can help?

52:35.661 --> 52:37.997
That would mean
I'd have to tell him.

52:38.031 --> 52:41.100
Millie, he's not gonna exist
once the sequel launches.

52:42.402 --> 52:44.370
His whole world's
about to end.

52:44.404 --> 52:46.705
Don't you think
he'd want a chance to save it?

52:48.740 --> 52:51.010
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

52:51.044 --> 52:53.146
- You got it.
- Guy?

52:53.179 --> 52:54.479
Hey! Hi!

52:54.513 --> 52:56.049
Guy, we need to talk.

52:56.082 --> 52:58.851
What's going on with your voice?
Where's your Australian accent?

52:58.885 --> 52:59.919
British.

52:59.953 --> 53:02.521
I think I know an Australian
accent when I see one.

53:02.554 --> 53:04.123
I turned off
the accent filter.

53:05.490 --> 53:06.758
This is me.

53:07.126 --> 53:08.194
Good.

53:08.227 --> 53:10.396
Look, I have to tell you
something really important.

53:10.430 --> 53:11.730
Are you married?

53:11.763 --> 53:12.597
No.

53:12.631 --> 53:15.969
Oh, God.

53:16.002 --> 53:18.071
That would have been like
the worst thing ever.

53:18.104 --> 53:20.006
Maybe not the worst thing.

53:20.340 --> 53:21.506
Huh.

53:21.540 --> 53:23.242
I have to show you something.

53:24.410 --> 53:25.610
Okay.

53:30.950 --> 53:31.851
Wow!

53:31.884 --> 53:33.953
I always wondered
what was in here.

53:33.987 --> 53:36.389
<i>Tune in to the Kill Cam</i>

53:36.422 --> 53:37.890
<i>for more of today's highlights</i>

53:37.924 --> 53:42.095
<i>of every bloody, bullet-ridden
corner of Free City.</i>

53:42.128 --> 53:43.729
<i>Has anyone seen my cat?</i>

53:43.762 --> 53:48.500
Hey, that's Phyllis.
She's always losing her cats.

53:48.533 --> 53:52.305
And there's Joe! He's
my friend, I know that guy.

53:52.338 --> 53:54.340
I don't get it.
What is this place?

53:54.374 --> 53:58.978
There is no easy way to say
this, but this city is a game.

53:59.012 --> 54:01.513
There's no easy way to say
this, I know it's a game.

54:01.546 --> 54:03.449
You taught me how to play it.
Boop-boop.

54:03.483 --> 54:04.884
Yes, you're right, I did.

54:04.918 --> 54:08.754
But it's not just that it's like a game.
It is a game.

54:08.788 --> 54:12.225
It's a video game.
And that's all it is.

54:12.258 --> 54:15.228
So the entire world is a game?

54:15.261 --> 54:16.362
Yes.

54:16.396 --> 54:18.364
And we're all just
players in the game?

54:18.398 --> 54:20.664
Not exactly.

54:21.600 --> 54:23.102
I'm a player.

54:23.136 --> 54:26.772
All these people here are players.
We live in the real world.

54:26.806 --> 54:28.540
But you only exist here.

54:28.573 --> 54:31.344
It's why you can
never leave Free City.

54:31.377 --> 54:33.279
You're what we call an NPC.

54:33.312 --> 54:34.546
NPC.

54:34.579 --> 54:37.616
The policeman
and the muscular bunny rabbit,

54:37.649 --> 54:38.918
they called me that.
What is an NPC?

54:38.950 --> 54:40.386
- <i>Let's take...</i>
- Just watch.

54:40.420 --> 54:41.888
<i>...another look
at that leaderboard.</i>

54:41.921 --> 54:43.189
<i>Everybody
get down on the ground!</i>

54:43.222 --> 54:44.689
<i>Nobody try to be a hero.</i>

54:44.723 --> 54:46.225
<i>This will all be over soon.</i>

54:46.259 --> 54:47.493
I don't understand.

54:47.527 --> 54:49.896
You're a
non-player character.

54:49.929 --> 54:52.331
- Non...
- A background person.

54:52.365 --> 54:55.802
Someone designed to make the
game more fun for real people.

54:55.835 --> 54:58.037
Wait, hold on a second.
Just stop for a second.

54:58.071 --> 54:59.405
I wanna make sure
I'm getting this straight.

54:59.439 --> 55:01.573
I just wanna fully
understand here.

55:01.606 --> 55:04.143
So, I'm fake?

55:04.177 --> 55:07.612
The entire world is fake?
I'm not even a main character,

55:07.646 --> 55:11.818
I'm just this idiot
who's in the background?

55:11.851 --> 55:15.221
Millie, why are you even saying this?
I love you.

55:15.253 --> 55:18.590
You only think that because
it's in your programming.

55:24.797 --> 55:26.899
Guy, I need
you to listen to me.

55:26.933 --> 55:29.768
In two days,
the game is gonna shut down. For good.

55:29.802 --> 55:32.505
When this sequel launches,
this whole city,

55:32.538 --> 55:34.907
you, all the people in it
who aren't players,

55:34.941 --> 55:36.409
they'll be gone forever.
You need to listen.

55:36.442 --> 55:39.512
My whole life, I felt like
there had to be something more.

55:39.545 --> 55:41.746
And then I saw you.

55:41.781 --> 55:44.918
And I knew I was right.
I was right!

55:45.852 --> 55:48.354
And for a second,
I felt amazing.

55:48.387 --> 55:50.288
- I know.
- Except you don't know.

55:50.323 --> 55:53.226
Because we're not the same.

55:53.259 --> 55:54.827
Isn't that what you said?
You said that.

55:54.861 --> 55:57.130
We're not the same.

55:57.163 --> 55:58.697
You're real.

55:59.432 --> 56:01.134
And I'm what? I'm what?

56:05.037 --> 56:06.172
You're not.

56:09.408 --> 56:11.310
You're not.

56:11.344 --> 56:15.081
Well, I may not be real,
but for a second there...

56:15.114 --> 56:16.983
I felt pretty alive.

57:18.778 --> 57:22.014
It's all a lie!

57:27.285 --> 57:29.355
Have the quarterly
reports on my desk by Friday.

57:29.388 --> 57:32.024
Quarterly reports.
My, what specific business lingo.

57:32.058 --> 57:34.160
Wow. Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.

57:34.193 --> 57:35.394
Until it crushes your soul.

57:35.428 --> 57:38.930
Has anyone seen my cat?
Has anyone seen my...

57:38.965 --> 57:40.967
Your cats?
No, Phyllis, I haven't seen them.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.037
But here's a revolutionary idea...
close your goddamn door.

57:45.071 --> 57:47.406
It's not like they're climbing
on top of one another,

57:47.440 --> 57:50.843
forming a little kitty tower,
and then jimmying the locks.

57:50.876 --> 57:53.179
They don't have
thumbs, Phyllis.

57:53.713 --> 57:55.314
No thumbs!

57:55.348 --> 57:59.051
Don't you get it?
Don't any of you get it?

57:59.085 --> 58:03.623
None of this matters! None of it!
It's fake! We don't matter!

58:03.656 --> 58:06.559
That building, that's fake!
This street...

58:06.591 --> 58:08.127
It's fake!

58:08.160 --> 58:09.262
That car...

58:15.635 --> 58:16.869
Officer Johnny!

58:16.902 --> 58:18.770
Have a good one, Guy.

58:26.611 --> 58:28.180
Oh, hey, uh...

58:29.649 --> 58:30.916
Come in.

58:40.826 --> 58:42.328
Here you go.

58:42.361 --> 58:43.362
Thank you.

58:44.463 --> 58:45.631
Buddy,

58:45.665 --> 58:51.103
what would you do if you found
out that you weren't real?

58:52.471 --> 58:53.572
What do you mean?

58:54.272 --> 58:55.374
Pretend with me.

58:55.408 --> 58:56.976
Okay, so...

58:57.009 --> 58:58.944
Can I pretend
I'm a ghost?

59:00.346 --> 59:01.480
Sure.

59:01.514 --> 59:04.817
Oh. Do I look like how I look like now?
Or whenever I die?

59:04.850 --> 59:06.018
Like, do I have
a funeral outfit on?

59:06.052 --> 59:07.753
- This is kind of funeral...
- Doesn't matter.

59:07.788 --> 59:09.155
...but even though it's a
work uniform, 'cause I got a tie on.

59:09.188 --> 59:11.190
Let's move on
from the concept, okay?

59:11.724 --> 59:13.726
Got it.

59:13.759 --> 59:16.862
I'm not a ghost.
I'm very disappointed,

59:16.896 --> 59:18.531
- but I get it.
- Yeah.

59:18.564 --> 59:23.135
I'm me, who I am right now,
and I'm just trying to help a friend.

59:24.070 --> 59:27.808
I say, okay, so
what if I'm not real?

59:27.840 --> 59:29.842
I'm sorry. "So what?"

59:29.875 --> 59:30.910
Yeah. So what?

59:30.942 --> 59:32.878
But if you're not real,

59:32.912 --> 59:35.481
doesn't that mean
that nothing you do matters?

59:35.514 --> 59:38.517
What does that mean?
Look, brother, I am sitting here

59:38.551 --> 59:42.455
with my best friend, trying to
help him get through a tough time.

59:42.488 --> 59:47.226
Right? And even if I'm not
real, this moment is.

59:48.361 --> 59:53.532
Right here, right now.
This moment is real.

59:53.566 --> 59:57.503
I mean, what's more real than a person
tryin' to help someone they love?

59:57.536 --> 01:00:02.508
Now, if that's not real,
I don't know what is.

01:00:05.111 --> 01:00:07.646
Do you know the
other security guards?

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.215
I know 'em all. Why?

01:00:09.882 --> 01:00:11.616
Hey, Buddy...

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:13.652
let's not have a good day...

01:00:14.855 --> 01:00:16.389
let's have a great day.

01:00:17.791 --> 01:00:19.125
Guy, what are we doin' here?

01:00:19.158 --> 01:00:21.828
We're here to get a video
clip for my friend Millie.

01:00:21.862 --> 01:00:23.562
Does this look intimidating?

01:00:23.596 --> 01:00:25.998
I don't know, Guy.
How do you hold this thing?

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:35.876
You have
something I want.

01:00:35.908 --> 01:00:37.710
And you're gonna hand it over.

01:00:39.912 --> 01:00:41.313
How'd you get in here?

01:00:41.347 --> 01:00:43.549
Easy. I know
your security guard.

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:45.351
Jimmy?

01:00:45.384 --> 01:00:46.419
His name is Luigi.

01:00:46.452 --> 01:00:48.220
So if you took some time
to learn his name...

01:00:48.254 --> 01:00:50.055
maybe he wouldn't
turn on you so quick.

01:00:50.089 --> 01:00:53.894
I need a video clip, and
you're gonna give it to me.

01:00:53.925 --> 01:00:55.694
Wait a minute, are you...

01:00:56.662 --> 01:00:57.864
Are you Blue Shirt Guy?

01:00:57.898 --> 01:00:59.398
Yeah, maybe.

01:00:59.432 --> 01:01:02.101
Holy shit! You're Guy!
You're Blue Shirt Guy! It's you!

01:01:02.134 --> 01:01:03.269
- Yeah.
- I love you.

01:01:03.302 --> 01:01:04.838
- You do?
- I mean...

01:01:04.871 --> 01:01:06.238
I'm like a fan.
You're awesome.

01:01:06.272 --> 01:01:07.606
You can have
anything you want.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.641
Wait, hold on one second.

01:01:08.674 --> 01:01:10.811
Gamers, listen up, this is
Revenjamin Buttons here.

01:01:10.844 --> 01:01:12.178
I'm here with Guy.

01:01:12.211 --> 01:01:14.680
The Guy, he's in my stash
house, and he's here to rob me.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:15.816
Can I get a little...

01:01:15.849 --> 01:01:19.051
- "what-what" for my followers, Guy?
- What?

01:01:19.084 --> 01:01:20.787
Perfect. All right,
so what's happening is...

01:01:20.821 --> 01:01:22.388
Guy's looking for a clip...

01:01:22.421 --> 01:01:25.257
showing a walkthrough I did
to get to the secret level.

01:01:26.992 --> 01:01:28.593
Who are you talking to?

01:01:29.962 --> 01:01:31.363
I'm sorry.

01:01:31.397 --> 01:01:34.700
Who am I talking to?
It's just such a classic Guy line.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:35.768
Right?

01:01:35.802 --> 01:01:38.304
You're good.
Oh, anyway...

01:01:38.337 --> 01:01:41.842
And you, you tried to steal it
from me with that Molotov chick.

01:01:41.876 --> 01:01:43.008
<i>Her name's Millie.</i>

01:01:43.042 --> 01:01:45.244
- Yeah. Wait, who?
- <i>Millie.</i>

01:01:45.277 --> 01:01:46.979
I think
it's going really well.

01:01:47.012 --> 01:01:50.082
I know. This is literally the first
time I took my gun out the holster.

01:01:50.115 --> 01:01:51.684
Totally. Right?

01:01:51.717 --> 01:01:54.887
Guy, I tried to go back through,
but the glitch is patched.

01:01:54.921 --> 01:01:56.455
And I never found it again.

01:01:56.489 --> 01:01:58.157
So I'm the only one that ever
saw what was on the other side.

01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:59.692
But it's all here,
check it out.

01:01:59.725 --> 01:02:02.428
It's pretty cool actually.
It's like a whole other world.

01:02:02.461 --> 01:02:04.730
- This is it? This is the game clip?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:08.234
Can you do one,
single, just one solid for me?

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:09.735
- One thing, I'll stop asking, okay?
- Yeah.

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.470
Just say my catchphrase.

01:02:11.504 --> 01:02:13.172
My viewers will just banana cream sandwich
all over themselves if you say it.

01:02:13.205 --> 01:02:15.007
I love banana
cream sandwiches.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:16.108
Maybe not this
banana cream sandwich.

01:02:16.141 --> 01:02:17.643
Yeah, this one.

01:02:17.676 --> 01:02:19.445
Okay, perfect. Okay, so just
say, "You know what time it is?"

01:02:19.478 --> 01:02:21.882
- You know what time it is?
- You know what time it is?

01:02:21.914 --> 01:02:23.015
You know what time it is?

01:02:23.048 --> 01:02:24.149
You know what time it is?

01:02:24.183 --> 01:02:25.384
You know
what time it is?

01:02:25.417 --> 01:02:26.887
You know
what time it is?

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.454
You know
what time it is?

01:02:28.487 --> 01:02:30.756
It's crime o'clock,
baby. Yeah.

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:31.892
It's crime o'cl...

01:02:31.925 --> 01:02:33.225
But, no, I can't
say that. That's...

01:02:33.259 --> 01:02:35.327
Okay. It's all right.
I'll say it myself.

01:02:35.361 --> 01:02:37.329
- All right, you know what time it is?
- No.

01:02:37.363 --> 01:02:39.365
It's crime o'cl...
Mom!

01:02:39.398 --> 01:02:40.934
Mom! Are you
serious with the...

01:02:40.967 --> 01:02:42.268
vacuum right now?

01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:44.470
You really have to do that here?
I'm saying my...

01:02:44.503 --> 01:02:46.038
catchphrase!
Everybody's watching!

01:02:46.071 --> 01:02:47.273
- God!
- You're 22,

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:49.009
living in my house,
there is no God!

01:02:49.041 --> 01:02:50.142
Sorry, Guy.

01:02:50.175 --> 01:02:53.312
Thank you, Mr. Buttons.
We're gonna go.

01:02:53.345 --> 01:02:55.114
No, no, no! No,
you gotta kill me.

01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:57.017
- I'm sorry, what?
- You gotta kill me. Please kill me.

01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:59.385
Give it to me, Daddy.
Give it to me!

01:02:59.418 --> 01:03:01.654
No. Please don't do that.
Please don't do that.

01:03:01.687 --> 01:03:03.990
We're not gonna hurt anybody.
I'm a good guy.

01:03:04.024 --> 01:03:05.524
What? What'd you say?

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.395
That's deep.

01:03:09.428 --> 01:03:10.396
No, it's not.

01:03:10.429 --> 01:03:11.697
That's like I can
taste you, deep.

01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:15.634
I want your help, Buddy.
I don't have the safeword.

01:03:15.668 --> 01:03:16.735
I know what you want.

01:03:16.769 --> 01:03:17.871
I don't want that.

01:03:17.904 --> 01:03:18.972
Yeah, you do.

01:03:19.005 --> 01:03:20.205
That's touching.

01:03:20.239 --> 01:03:21.540
- They're touching.
- Yeah.

01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:23.342
I know what you want.

01:03:23.375 --> 01:03:24.710
Yes, I do.

01:03:24.743 --> 01:03:27.379
You want a little bit
of that <i>Free City</i> Itchy Kitty.

01:03:27.413 --> 01:03:29.214
- No.
- Uh-huh. Yes, you do.

01:03:29.248 --> 01:03:31.183
<i>The way you move,
it's almost dirty.</i>

01:03:31.216 --> 01:03:32.518
What about a little
Thanos Glove...

01:03:32.551 --> 01:03:36.322
into a little bit
of Thanos Snap?

01:03:36.355 --> 01:03:38.256
- Oh. That looked like it hurt.
- Yeah, a little bit.

01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:39.525
A little Sunday Drive.

01:03:39.558 --> 01:03:41.293
You have
a beautiful home.

01:03:41.327 --> 01:03:44.697
- Snakey Man? No? No Snakey Man?
- Bye, Mr. Buttons.

01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:47.333
Come on, give me one snake!
Just come on, man.

01:03:47.366 --> 01:03:49.435
Mom!
Do not touch that sock!

01:03:49.468 --> 01:03:51.269
I swear to God,
if you touch that sock...

01:03:51.303 --> 01:03:53.405
you will be in therapy
for the rest of your life!

01:03:53.439 --> 01:03:56.810
No! That's my special sock!
Put it down!

01:04:01.848 --> 01:04:03.616
<i>Millie, please.</i>

01:04:03.649 --> 01:04:06.086
Please wake up from
your standing coma.

01:04:06.118 --> 01:04:08.520
Look, I know this world
is just a game to you

01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:10.656
and you can come
and go, but to me...

01:04:10.689 --> 01:04:13.291
this place, these people,
that's all I have.

01:04:13.325 --> 01:04:15.461
And if I can help you save it,
I wanna do that...

01:04:15.494 --> 01:04:18.098
but you gotta wake up, please.

01:04:18.163 --> 01:04:19.933
Millie, I'm sorry
for running away.

01:04:19.966 --> 01:04:21.700
Guy?

01:04:22.701 --> 01:04:24.904
Oh, that's so scary!
It's just terrifying.

01:04:24.938 --> 01:04:26.138
I know, I know.

01:04:26.171 --> 01:04:27.841
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:04:27.874 --> 01:04:30.342
Look, you may have started out living
in the background, but so did I.

01:04:30.376 --> 01:04:32.378
We're done with that.

01:04:34.014 --> 01:04:35.214
I got you a present.

01:04:36.281 --> 01:04:37.650
I didn't have time to wrap it.

01:04:38.751 --> 01:04:39.819
What?

01:04:48.128 --> 01:04:51.230
<i>They say over a
billion NPCs are killed every year.</i>

01:04:51.263 --> 01:04:55.869
<i>Now, I'm not gonna lie,
that's at least 50% my fault.</i>

01:04:55.902 --> 01:04:59.405
I used to shoot
all the secondary characters

01:04:59.438 --> 01:05:01.141
when I was bored, you know?

01:05:01.173 --> 01:05:04.543
And then, I'd
teabag 'em a little bit.

01:05:04.576 --> 01:05:07.446
<i>Who the hell even knows
who this Blue Shirt Guy is?</i>

01:05:07.479 --> 01:05:09.481
<i>But I'll tell you this,
he's got me thinkin'</i>

01:05:09.515 --> 01:05:11.216
<i>about NPCs and
how I play the game.</i>

01:05:11.251 --> 01:05:15.521
<i>The game wasn't even made for someone
like this, for a player to be a good guy.</i>

01:05:15.554 --> 01:05:17.690
<i>He's also a really cute guy.</i>

01:05:17.723 --> 01:05:19.725
<i>And not just the face, you know,
like the whole thing.</i>

01:05:19.758 --> 01:05:21.760
<i>And, honestly,
it's got me realizing...</i>

01:05:21.795 --> 01:05:24.496
<i>maybe we've been thinking about
NPCs wrong this whole time.</i>

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:26.532
<i>I think Blue Shirt Guy's
like a symbol, you know?</i>

01:05:26.565 --> 01:05:28.434
<i>Like, maybe people
can be whatever they want.</i>

01:05:28.467 --> 01:05:30.870
<i>He's like an icon.
Is that the right word?</i>

01:05:30.903 --> 01:05:33.106
<i>Like, he reminds us
of what's possible.</i>

01:05:33.139 --> 01:05:34.506
<i>Also, he's like crazy hot.</i>

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:37.643
<i>Oh, my God, totally.
I'd hit those pixels hard.</i>

01:05:37.676 --> 01:05:39.179
<i>We should all be
more like Blue Shirt Guy.</i>

01:05:39.211 --> 01:05:40.512
Maybe we just
stop the killing.

01:05:40.546 --> 01:05:43.083
He's dead! You hear me?

01:05:43.116 --> 01:05:44.683
The guy, put him up here.

01:05:44.717 --> 01:05:47.219
Put him up here on the screen.
Put him on the screen.

01:05:47.252 --> 01:05:50.990
Make me see him. There he is.

01:05:51.024 --> 01:05:53.559
Yes. There he is,
the little do-gooder.

01:05:53.592 --> 01:05:55.095
I thought
you liked Blue Shirt.

01:05:55.128 --> 01:05:56.863
Don't say words to me!

01:05:56.896 --> 01:06:00.133
People are so busy watching this
loser on Twitch and YouTube.

01:06:00.166 --> 01:06:01.266
You know what
they're not doing, guys?

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.634
Buying <i>Free City 2.</i>

01:06:02.668 --> 01:06:04.871
- Pre-sales are down 16%.
- 60.

01:06:04.904 --> 01:06:06.638
60. That's bad.

01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:09.374
Oh, we are 48 hours
from launch.

01:06:10.076 --> 01:06:11.710
Yeah, he's gone viral.

01:06:11.744 --> 01:06:14.948
Yeah, a virus that's giving me ass
and ball cancer at the same time!

01:06:15.782 --> 01:06:18.283
Inoperable!

01:06:18.317 --> 01:06:19.651
You know,
this whole good guy routine...

01:06:19.685 --> 01:06:22.621
it is a bad influence,
and is bad for the franchise.

01:06:22.654 --> 01:06:25.224
I want him gone.
I don't care who it is, boot him.

01:06:25.257 --> 01:06:26.458
You can't.

01:06:27.093 --> 01:06:28.194
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

01:06:28.227 --> 01:06:29.594
You can't.

01:06:29.628 --> 01:06:30.696
Why not?

01:06:30.729 --> 01:06:33.432
Because he's not a hacker, Antwan.
He's an NPC.

01:06:33.465 --> 01:06:35.300
You're tryin' to tell me
that all this shit

01:06:35.334 --> 01:06:37.469
about a self-aware
NPC is real?

01:06:37.503 --> 01:06:40.773
Yeah. I don't know how or
why, but he's real.

01:06:41.707 --> 01:06:43.843
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

01:06:46.311 --> 01:06:48.380
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:06:48.413 --> 01:06:50.716
What to do? What to do?
Got it.

01:06:52.317 --> 01:06:53.787
And kip-up!

01:06:57.322 --> 01:06:58.757
So we can't kick him
out of the game.

01:06:58.792 --> 01:07:01.928
How do we reset his AI?
Ideas, people. Come on.

01:07:01.961 --> 01:07:03.595
Hit me. Ideas.

01:07:03.629 --> 01:07:05.265
You could
just reboot the server.

01:07:05.330 --> 01:07:06.331
Keep talking.

01:07:06.365 --> 01:07:07.867
If we reboot the server...

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:11.137
then he's just gonna revert back
to a regular non-player guy.

01:07:11.171 --> 01:07:13.305
- Solution.
- Antwan.

01:07:13.338 --> 01:07:14.773
Antwan, you're talking
about terminating...

01:07:14.808 --> 01:07:16.575
the first confirmed
artificially intelligent

01:07:16.608 --> 01:07:17.743
life-form right now, okay?

01:07:17.777 --> 01:07:19.545
Honey, honey. Shush.

01:07:20.312 --> 01:07:21.747
He's losing me money.

01:07:21.781 --> 01:07:25.251
So, I don't care if he's
Arnold-Frickin'- Schwarzen-Vader.

01:07:25.285 --> 01:07:26.786
Terminate him. Reboot.

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:28.788
- On it.
- You can't do that.

01:07:28.822 --> 01:07:29.823
Reboot!

01:07:39.398 --> 01:07:42.534
<i>Order up and
drown your bloodlust...</i>

01:07:42.568 --> 01:07:45.238
<i>with a tall glass
of murder juice.</i>

01:07:45.271 --> 01:07:47.339
<i>Here's this week's highlights.</i>

01:07:47.372 --> 01:07:49.641
He's very expressive
with his body.

01:07:49.675 --> 01:07:50.609
Clearly.

01:07:50.642 --> 01:07:51.845
<i>What is that?</i>

01:07:51.878 --> 01:07:53.378
<i>It's a whole new
world over there.</i>

01:07:53.412 --> 01:07:54.981
<i>Some kinda paradise and shit.</i>

01:07:55.014 --> 01:07:56.415
Oh, my God, that's it.

01:07:56.448 --> 01:08:00.887
It's our original build and that build
is proof our code is in the game.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.222
You have no idea
how long I've waited for this.

01:08:03.256 --> 01:08:04.824
I've seen this place.

01:08:04.858 --> 01:08:06.159
What?

01:08:11.865 --> 01:08:13.166
Yeah.

01:08:13.199 --> 01:08:15.068
What do you mean? How could you
have possibly seen it?

01:08:19.404 --> 01:08:21.506
Millie? Millie?

01:09:06.484 --> 01:09:08.754
We're dark.
<i>Free City</i> is offline.

01:09:16.328 --> 01:09:18.398
What is happening?

01:09:23.236 --> 01:09:24.770
Bye-bye, Blue Shirt.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:27.140
No, no, no.

01:09:45.756 --> 01:09:47.160
It's okay. Come on.

01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:54.700
Come on.

01:09:54.733 --> 01:09:57.236
Come on, come on, come on.

01:10:02.641 --> 01:10:04.243
Good morning, Goldie.

01:10:08.714 --> 01:10:11.417
<i>Front of warm, dry gunfire...</i>

01:10:11.451 --> 01:10:13.353
<i>mixed with late
afternoon stabbings...</i>

01:10:13.386 --> 01:10:15.221
<i>could leave you in the streets
wet with the blood of innocents...</i>

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:17.123
<i>by early Tuesday night.</i>

01:10:17.156 --> 01:10:20.126
What really is the difference between
a light roast and a dark roast?

01:10:20.159 --> 01:10:21.693
Nobody knows.

01:10:21.727 --> 01:10:23.495
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

01:10:23.528 --> 01:10:24.730
Guy, can we talk?

01:10:24.763 --> 01:10:26.065
How does the sunglass girl
know your name?

01:10:26.099 --> 01:10:26.933
I don't know. Keep walking.

01:10:26.966 --> 01:10:28.533
Come on, Guy!
You know me.

01:10:28.567 --> 01:10:30.569
You know this.

01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:32.472
You said this clip showed
a place you'd seen before.

01:10:32.504 --> 01:10:34.207
I need to know where.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.075
The data's been erased,
but it's in your head.

01:10:36.109 --> 01:10:39.711
Please try to remember.
This is really important.

01:10:39.745 --> 01:10:43.216
Please, Guy, think.
The ice cream, the swings?

01:10:43.249 --> 01:10:44.716
Oh, my Guy loves swings.

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:46.718
At Free City Harbor Park,
there's a great swing set there.

01:10:46.752 --> 01:10:48.054
- Have you been?
- Yes.

01:10:48.087 --> 01:10:49.455
We had bubble gum ice cream.

01:10:49.489 --> 01:10:52.358
OMG, I love
bubble gum ice cream!

01:10:52.392 --> 01:10:53.826
He loves the
bubble gum ice cream.

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:56.029
Yes, I know. We had it
together, remember?

01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:59.698
Please, Guy,
you're all I've got.

01:11:03.668 --> 01:11:07.407
I'm sorry, lady. I think
you have the wrong guy.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.043
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

01:11:24.023 --> 01:11:25.058
Hello?

01:11:25.091 --> 01:11:26.793
<i>I might've found something.</i>

01:11:26.826 --> 01:11:29.561
I've been going through Guy's code
and there is something there...

01:11:29.594 --> 01:11:31.663
even now, after the wipe.

01:11:31.696 --> 01:11:33.332
What's the point?

01:11:33.366 --> 01:11:35.634
Guy was, like, a one-in-a-billion miracle.
We can't replicate that.

01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:37.303
<i>I tried, okay?
You were right, it's over.</i>

01:11:37.336 --> 01:11:40.106
No, Millie, Millie,
you're not listening to me, all right?

01:11:40.139 --> 01:11:43.142
A reboot, it doesn't
erase his AI coding...

01:11:43.176 --> 01:11:45.411
you literally would have to
destroy the servers to do that.

01:11:45.445 --> 01:11:48.047
<i>His AI is still there,
it just needs to be accessed.</i>

01:11:48.081 --> 01:11:50.383
I've seen him, Keys.
He's forgotten everything.

01:11:50.416 --> 01:11:52.651
Just look at the
trace log I sent you.

01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:54.353
<i>It'll explain everything.</i>

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.668
<i>Now, from the beginning...</i>

01:12:09.701 --> 01:12:12.505
<i>Guy's behavior is much more
complex than it should be,</i>

01:12:12.538 --> 01:12:14.507
<i>thanks to our code.</i>

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:18.144
<i>But he's still stuck in Free City.
He's still stuck in this life, this loop.</i>

01:12:18.177 --> 01:12:22.248
<i>And then, something changes.
He comes to life. Why?</i>

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.550
<i>And then I remembered.</i>

01:12:24.584 --> 01:12:27.854
<i>One of the characters from</i> Life Itself
<i>was this guy that I nicknamed Lovelorn.</i>

01:12:27.887 --> 01:12:31.991
And he was someone who was designed
to never meet the right person.

01:12:32.024 --> 01:12:34.327
It was essentially the building
blocks of the character.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.662
But he never stopped hoping that he
would meet "the girl of his dreams."

01:12:38.697 --> 01:12:40.664
<i>So I had to base this girl
off of someone...</i>

01:12:40.699 --> 01:12:44.270
<i>and who better than the person that
I was sitting next to every day?</i>

01:12:44.303 --> 01:12:45.404
<i>You.</i>

01:12:45.438 --> 01:12:47.006
But then, one day...

01:12:47.039 --> 01:12:49.641
<i>he meets you in</i> Free City,
<i>and once he sees you...</i>

01:12:49.674 --> 01:12:51.110
<i>he can never be the same.</i>

01:12:51.144 --> 01:12:55.047
<i>He was supposed to feel doomed,
but instead, he feels alive...</i>

01:12:55.081 --> 01:12:57.984
<i>until eventually, he is alive.</i>

01:12:59.218 --> 01:13:01.220
<i>You changed him, Millie.</i>

01:13:01.254 --> 01:13:05.791
You changed his code.
And I think you can do it again.

01:13:05.825 --> 01:13:08.194
<i>You brought him
to life, Millie.</i>

01:13:09.295 --> 01:13:11.230
<i>You brought him to life.</i>

01:13:11.264 --> 01:13:13.765
<i>And he was alive because
he met the one person...</i>

01:13:15.501 --> 01:13:16.869
Don't have a good day...

01:13:17.702 --> 01:13:19.105
have a great day.

01:13:19.138 --> 01:13:20.573
Thank you.

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:22.108
Take care.

01:13:22.141 --> 01:13:23.775
Everybody down on the ground!

01:13:23.809 --> 01:13:26.345
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

01:13:26.379 --> 01:13:27.446
Okay.

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.115
Everybody except you.

01:13:32.617 --> 01:13:34.420
Door, door, door. I got it.

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:35.754
Please, I have a goldfish.

01:13:35.788 --> 01:13:37.123
Look, I don't have long.

01:13:37.156 --> 01:13:39.225
I just took you hostage,
so there are three badges on me.

01:13:39.257 --> 01:13:41.127
Badges? Is that like a
Girl Scout thing? What is that?

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.361
There is something
inside you, Guy.

01:13:42.395 --> 01:13:43.728
What? I don't want
anything inside of me.

01:13:43.762 --> 01:13:45.231
They stuck you
in that bank and...

01:13:45.263 --> 01:13:46.399
- expected you to just follow the rules...
- I love the bank.

01:13:46.432 --> 01:13:47.567
...and do the same
thing every day.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.634
You are so much
more than that.

01:13:48.668 --> 01:13:49.768
I don't wanna be
more than that.

01:13:49.802 --> 01:13:51.437
No, and I need you
to remember it.

01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:53.705
Why have you been following me
and how do you know my name?

01:13:53.738 --> 01:13:55.007
Put these on.

01:13:55.041 --> 01:13:56.342
I don't have to do anything
that I don't wanna do.

01:13:56.375 --> 01:13:58.743
True. The choice is totally yours.

01:13:58.778 --> 01:14:00.580
Okay. Okay. Fine.

01:14:05.351 --> 01:14:07.285
What is that?

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.322
What are these?
Trick glasses or something?

01:14:09.355 --> 01:14:10.223
Listen carefully.

01:14:10.256 --> 01:14:13.159
In 24 hours, this world,
everyone you know,

01:14:13.192 --> 01:14:15.661
it's all gonna
disappear for good.

01:14:15.695 --> 01:14:17.163
Can you please just let me go?

01:14:17.196 --> 01:14:18.831
I mean, I haven't really
even seen your face.

01:14:18.864 --> 01:14:20.166
I mean, I've seen
the general area,

01:14:20.199 --> 01:14:21.933
but I'm not really good
with descriptive words.

01:14:21.968 --> 01:14:23.502
Not really good
with words in general.

01:14:24.604 --> 01:14:26.239
- Screw it.
- What? Oh!

01:15:04.277 --> 01:15:05.378
I remember.

01:15:06.445 --> 01:15:08.414
Welcome back.

01:15:08.447 --> 01:15:11.417
No. I remember everything.

01:15:12.318 --> 01:15:13.919
Come with me.

01:15:13.953 --> 01:15:17.189
I do this every day so much,
I'd forgotten why.

01:15:20.493 --> 01:15:22.194
Do you see that?

01:15:22.228 --> 01:15:23.796
Right there.

01:15:24.297 --> 01:15:25.831
Oh, my God.

01:15:27.033 --> 01:15:28.567
Oh, my God!

01:15:28.601 --> 01:15:32.238
Antwan hid our original build past
the horizon, making it invisible...

01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:35.441
but he forgot to scrub
the reflections.

01:15:35.474 --> 01:15:38.311
It's still out there, Guy.
We just can't see it.

01:15:38.344 --> 01:15:40.179
If we can get there,
that is the evidence we need.

01:15:40.212 --> 01:15:43.281
You can't go past
the water line. I tried.

01:15:43.316 --> 01:15:45.318
We need help.

01:15:45.351 --> 01:15:47.420
Antwan found a way
to hide it in plain sight

01:15:47.453 --> 01:15:49.755
in the one place no one
can even get to.

01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:51.090
<i>I can't even believe</i>

01:15:51.123 --> 01:15:51.923
<i>he's smart enough
to be this diabolical.</i>

01:15:51.957 --> 01:15:53.459
Keys, I need you to focus.

01:15:53.492 --> 01:15:57.163
Okay. So, the reflection shows the
build past the southern horizon.

01:15:57.196 --> 01:15:59.365
But the game physics won't
allow you past the beach.

01:15:59.398 --> 01:16:02.101
But you think you can find a way
to get us past the collision mesh?

01:16:02.134 --> 01:16:03.502
<i>We're gonna need a bridge.</i>

01:16:03.536 --> 01:16:05.705
You just get to Hitman's Beach
and I'll figure out the rest.

01:16:05.738 --> 01:16:07.106
And, Millie?

01:16:07.506 --> 01:16:08.809
<i>Be careful.</i>

01:16:08.841 --> 01:16:10.676
Antwan may be an asshole,
but he's not stupid.

01:16:10.710 --> 01:16:13.646
He'll figure out what you're up to and
he'll throw everything he's got at you.

01:16:13.679 --> 01:16:15.214
You're right.

01:16:15.247 --> 01:16:18.117
<i>Um, hi, Millie,
and other person I can't see...</i>

01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:19.685
<i>well, I have an idea.</i>

01:16:19.719 --> 01:16:21.520
<i>What if he has
nothing to throw?</i>

01:16:23.222 --> 01:16:26.125
Everyone!
Gather around!

01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:29.161
Thank you for coming.

01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:31.297
Now, you know me, I'm Guy.

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:32.932
Hi, Guy.

01:16:33.466 --> 01:16:35.134
Hi.

01:16:35.167 --> 01:16:38.170
What I'm about to say
may be hard to understand.

01:16:38.904 --> 01:16:40.406
Really hard to understand.

01:16:42.108 --> 01:16:45.411
But, are you sick
of living in the background?

01:16:46.645 --> 01:16:48.481
Aren't you sick
of being shot at?

01:16:48.514 --> 01:16:49.548
Enough.

01:16:49.582 --> 01:16:51.117
- Taken hostage?
- No more.

01:16:51.150 --> 01:16:52.485
- Run over?
- We done with that.

01:16:52.518 --> 01:16:54.887
Robbed? Stabbed?
Used as a human shield?

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.522
We are tired of being stabbed!

01:16:56.555 --> 01:16:57.791
- Buddy!
- Sorry.

01:16:57.824 --> 01:16:59.458
What are you
trying to say, Guy?

01:16:59.492 --> 01:17:02.728
I'm tryin' to say that things in
this city don't have to be this way.

01:17:02.762 --> 01:17:03.896
Things can be different.

01:17:03.929 --> 01:17:05.164
Different how?

01:17:05.197 --> 01:17:08.901
- For starters, you can put your arms down.
- Yeah.

01:17:10.569 --> 01:17:13.406
There you go. You got it. Yeah.

01:17:13.439 --> 01:17:14.974
Keep pushing. There you go.

01:17:15.007 --> 01:17:16.041
Breathe through it.
There you go.

01:17:16.075 --> 01:17:17.176
Do it. Do it. Do it.

01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:18.812
No, not gonna happen.
Nope.

01:17:18.845 --> 01:17:20.179
That feels unnatural.

01:17:20.212 --> 01:17:22.481
I mean, what about when
someone runs in with a gun?

01:17:22.515 --> 01:17:24.885
Having my arms up
is just a real time saver.

01:17:24.918 --> 01:17:29.790
Except, what if the guy
with the gun doesn't come?

01:17:29.823 --> 01:17:31.289
- What?
- What?

01:17:31.323 --> 01:17:32.758
There's always
a guy with a gun.

01:17:32.793 --> 01:17:34.660
So many guys with guns.

01:17:34.693 --> 01:17:38.297
People, what if our world
doesn't have to be so scary?

01:17:39.598 --> 01:17:41.267
What if we can change it?

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:46.505
Millie! How many times a day are
the banks robbed in your world?

01:17:46.539 --> 01:17:47.740
Hardly ever, Guy.

01:17:47.773 --> 01:17:49.941
What about corpses, Millie?

01:17:49.975 --> 01:17:51.076
- What?
- You see a lot of those?

01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:52.678
How many an hour?

01:17:52.711 --> 01:17:54.146
None per hour, Guy.

01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:56.015
What about gun violence?

01:17:56.048 --> 01:17:57.716
See a lot of gun violence
in your world?

01:17:57.750 --> 01:18:01.287
Actually, that's a big problem, Guy.
It's a massive problem.

01:18:03.022 --> 01:18:04.123
I didn't see that coming.

01:18:04.156 --> 01:18:06.492
It's true. It really sucks.

01:18:06.525 --> 01:18:11.096
The point is, we don't have to
be spectators to our own lives.

01:18:11.832 --> 01:18:13.632
We can be whatever we want.

01:18:13.666 --> 01:18:15.401
We can't all be you, Guy.

01:18:15.434 --> 01:18:16.635
That's not true.

01:18:17.938 --> 01:18:21.273
What's inside of me
is inside of you, too.

01:18:21.307 --> 01:18:22.541
What?

01:18:22.575 --> 01:18:25.244
It's inside of each and
every one of you. You're growing.

01:18:25.277 --> 01:18:28.681
I need more in my life than drip coffee.
I want to make...

01:18:28.714 --> 01:18:29.748
A cappuccino.

01:18:29.783 --> 01:18:31.616
A goddamn difference
in the world.

01:18:31.650 --> 01:18:32.885
Much, much better.

01:18:32.919 --> 01:18:33.986
And a green tea boba.

01:18:34.019 --> 01:18:35.789
- Holy shit!
- That's right!

01:18:35.822 --> 01:18:37.255
You go, girl.

01:18:37.289 --> 01:18:38.457
Oh, my God, you're amazing!

01:18:38.491 --> 01:18:40.292
If I could just make it out
past that water...

01:18:40.326 --> 01:18:42.428
there's a world out there
where we can be free.

01:18:42.461 --> 01:18:44.563
Where we get to decide
who we wanna be.

01:18:44.597 --> 01:18:47.166
Where we can matter.
But we have to fight for it.

01:18:47.199 --> 01:18:49.068
We have to fight together.

01:18:49.101 --> 01:18:51.203
Yeah!

01:18:51.237 --> 01:18:53.772
You guys have always done
what's expected of you.

01:18:53.807 --> 01:18:55.474
But that shit ends today.

01:18:55.508 --> 01:18:56.909
Yeah!

01:18:56.943 --> 01:18:58.744
I don't even know
what's happening right now!

01:18:58.778 --> 01:18:59.813
But I love it!

01:19:01.447 --> 01:19:02.748
I love it!

01:19:03.884 --> 01:19:05.050
I love it!

01:19:05.084 --> 01:19:06.853
I love it, too!
Come on, guys, get in here!

01:19:06.887 --> 01:19:10.022
Huddle up! Here's what we're gonna do!
Everyone in!

01:19:16.161 --> 01:19:17.964
Everybody get down
on the ground!

01:19:23.003 --> 01:19:24.236
Hello?

01:19:25.704 --> 01:19:27.640
Where the hell is everybody?

01:19:28.507 --> 01:19:30.075
Hello?

01:19:40.419 --> 01:19:42.521
Where are all the NPCs?

01:19:50.964 --> 01:19:54.000
<i>Look, I've been playing</i>
Free City <i>for, like, three years now.</i>

01:19:54.034 --> 01:19:56.201
<i>I've never seen
anything like this.</i>

01:19:56.235 --> 01:19:59.705
<i>Up until recently, I don't even know if
I'd have noticed a few NPCs going missing.</i>

01:19:59.738 --> 01:20:02.809
<i>And I don't know if this is
just some whack Reddit theory...</i>

01:20:02.842 --> 01:20:06.846
<i>but some people are saying that
Blue Shirt Guy isn't even a player.</i>

01:20:06.879 --> 01:20:09.748
- <i>That he's actual AI.</i>
- <i>AI?</i>

01:20:09.783 --> 01:20:13.251
<i>Actual AI. You know, alive.</i>

01:20:13.285 --> 01:20:15.588
<i>It's why Blue Shirt Guy
is trending everywhere.</i>

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:18.623
<i>Antwan, if you're watching
this, please fix the game.</i>

01:20:18.657 --> 01:20:21.193
- <i>And most of all, bring back Blue Shirt.</i>
- Oh, my God. My God!

01:20:21.226 --> 01:20:22.695
Antwan, you should see this.

01:20:24.798 --> 01:20:28.233
<i>And you, you tried to steal
it from me with that Molotov chick.</i>

01:20:28.266 --> 01:20:29.501
- <i>Her name's Millie.</i>
- <i>Who?</i>

01:20:29.535 --> 01:20:30.502
<i>Millie.</i>

01:20:30.536 --> 01:20:33.606
Got her. Got her!
Got you! Got you!

01:20:33.639 --> 01:20:36.375
Mouser! Put him up on the screen.
Now. Put him up.

01:20:36.408 --> 01:20:38.143
That's it. Come on, quicker.

01:20:38.177 --> 01:20:39.813
Yes, there he is.

01:20:39.846 --> 01:20:43.549
He's joyriding around Free City
with some player called Molotovgirl.

01:20:44.216 --> 01:20:47.020
AKA Millie Rusk.

01:20:47.053 --> 01:20:48.754
Millie Rusk? Isn't that
Keys' old partner?

01:20:48.788 --> 01:20:49.990
Yeah.

01:20:50.023 --> 01:20:52.124
Also the one who's trying to hit
me with this bogus lawsuit...

01:20:52.157 --> 01:20:54.693
'cause she's desperate
for a piece of Soonami Kwan.

01:20:54.727 --> 01:20:56.128
Boot Molotovgirl now.

01:20:56.161 --> 01:21:00.366
I'm trying. I'm trying as hard as I
can, but her account's spoofed.

01:21:00.399 --> 01:21:01.667
This woman is exceptional.

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.135
Then kill her in the game.

01:21:03.168 --> 01:21:05.839
"What?" Yes,
I said that. Kill her.

01:21:05.872 --> 01:21:09.642
Throw everything at them,
all right? Five badges, G.

01:21:09.675 --> 01:21:11.310
Yeah, just one problem.

01:21:11.343 --> 01:21:12.846
We don't have anything.

01:21:12.879 --> 01:21:14.047
Whatchu talking about, Willis?

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:15.581
We don't have any defenses.

01:21:15.614 --> 01:21:19.184
We don't have police,
military, no nothing.

01:21:19.218 --> 01:21:20.954
It's what I've been
trying to tell you.

01:21:20.987 --> 01:21:24.690
It's like every
NPC went on strike.

01:21:26.225 --> 01:21:28.727
Got a tall, half-caf,
double foam oat milk,

01:21:28.761 --> 01:21:30.262
matcha latte with cinnamon!

01:21:30.295 --> 01:21:31.798
- That's me.
- Hey.

01:21:31.831 --> 01:21:33.265
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:21:33.298 --> 01:21:34.366
Cheers.

01:21:37.103 --> 01:21:38.838
Go get 'em, Guy!

01:21:40.406 --> 01:21:42.675
It's like a digital walkout.

01:21:43.076 --> 01:21:44.778
No, it's not.

01:21:44.811 --> 01:21:46.846
They're doing this on purpose,
it's part of their plan.

01:21:46.879 --> 01:21:49.214
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna kill them in the game.

01:21:49.248 --> 01:21:51.283
Turn off respawn,
kill them dead, now.

01:21:51.316 --> 01:21:53.886
But that means any players
who die will be done for good.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.354
They'll freak out.

01:21:57.356 --> 01:21:59.725
I don't care.

01:21:59.758 --> 01:22:04.329
Sir? Sir, just to be clear,
are you telling me that it's go time?

01:22:04.363 --> 01:22:05.464
Are you looking
for some sort of banter thing

01:22:05.497 --> 01:22:06.632
'cause you think
we're friends now...

01:22:06.665 --> 01:22:08.200
and we're in some sort
of gang together?

01:22:08.233 --> 01:22:10.268
Yes. Yes, that's exactly
what I'm looking for.

01:22:10.302 --> 01:22:11.336
Cool, we're a team.

01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:12.404
We should come up

01:22:12.438 --> 01:22:13.605
- with a catchphrase, okay?
- All right.

01:22:13.639 --> 01:22:15.374
- On three. One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

01:22:15.407 --> 01:22:17.509
Get back to work!

01:22:18.111 --> 01:22:19.611
Someone find me Keys!

01:22:24.017 --> 01:22:26.853
All right, people, you heard him.
It's go time!

01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:33.793
Okay, that's not good.

01:22:35.195 --> 01:22:37.130
He knows where we're going.

01:22:42.869 --> 01:22:45.138
All right, I got him.
I got him. Don't worry.

01:22:45.171 --> 01:22:47.006
Want some four wheels
to the face?

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.574
Take that. Boom!

01:22:51.778 --> 01:22:54.646
Rabbit's coming for you.
Apex predator.

01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:57.349
Whoa!

01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:06.960
Here we go.
Y'all watching this?

01:23:06.993 --> 01:23:08.260
I'm about to end this fool.

01:23:10.395 --> 01:23:12.765
Come on, come on, come on.

01:23:12.799 --> 01:23:14.901
Keys, if you're there,
a little help, please.

01:23:26.012 --> 01:23:30.216
God! Okay, who did that?
Who is doing that?

01:23:30.249 --> 01:23:34.220
Don't play with me! Seriously!
I'm under way too much pressure!

01:23:38.792 --> 01:23:39.793
Come on!

01:23:43.896 --> 01:23:44.998
Go, go, go!

01:24:00.612 --> 01:24:02.849
I just checked with security.
Keys hasn't left the building.

01:24:02.882 --> 01:24:04.184
Oh, sounds like you've
done everything possible.

01:24:04.217 --> 01:24:05.317
Time to give up?
You wanna give up?

01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:06.318
No, I'm sensing you
want me to keep looking.

01:24:06.351 --> 01:24:07.586
- Go.
- I'll be back.

01:24:07.619 --> 01:24:10.622
I have no idea where
these fools are running to.

01:24:10.656 --> 01:24:14.227
I do. Southern shore.
Hitman's Beach.

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:16.628
Well, that's stupid.
There's nothing out there but water.

01:24:16.662 --> 01:24:19.531
Game physics won't even let
you get past the shoreline.

01:24:21.134 --> 01:24:23.335
Unless there is
something out there.

01:24:24.369 --> 01:24:26.338
Antwan, is there
something there?

01:24:27.539 --> 01:24:29.775
Screw it. Art nerds.

01:24:29.809 --> 01:24:31.144
Time for Dude.

01:24:31.177 --> 01:24:32.312
We're still working on him.

01:24:32.344 --> 01:24:34.746
I worked on him myself.
He's perfect.

01:24:34.781 --> 01:24:36.850
Drop in Dude now.

01:24:36.883 --> 01:24:38.650
Just do it. He's got,
like, half a brain...

01:24:38.684 --> 01:24:42.055
he's barely written,
but sure, start the upload.

01:24:49.594 --> 01:24:50.762
What are we
supposed to do now?

01:24:50.797 --> 01:24:53.000
Now Keys finds us a bridge.

01:24:54.033 --> 01:24:57.103
Come to collect those
knives you stabbed in my back, bro?

01:24:58.805 --> 01:25:00.672
You've been helping Millie
Rusk this whole time.

01:25:00.706 --> 01:25:02.275
She's looking for your build.

01:25:02.308 --> 01:25:04.077
What build, Antwan?

01:25:04.110 --> 01:25:05.845
It's not like you used
our code anyway, right?

01:25:05.878 --> 01:25:07.246
And if you didn't
use our code...

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.549
then how can our original
build be in the game, right?

01:25:10.582 --> 01:25:12.684
Or am I missing something?

01:25:14.386 --> 01:25:15.587
Leave us.

01:25:18.858 --> 01:25:22.527
Okay, Keys,
let's have a real talk.

01:25:22.561 --> 01:25:25.464
If I'd put out your dumb game,
it would have bombed.

01:25:25.497 --> 01:25:26.933
Antwan, you don't know
it would've failed.

01:25:26.966 --> 01:25:28.134
Yeah, I do know.

01:25:28.167 --> 01:25:31.004
I looked at the numbers,
the tracking, the focus groups.

01:25:31.037 --> 01:25:34.841
Has it ever occurred to you that
some things matter more than numbers?

01:25:34.874 --> 01:25:37.509
What matters more
than numbers? Money?

01:25:37.542 --> 01:25:40.380
Yo, news flash, bro,
money is still numbers.

01:25:40.412 --> 01:25:41.981
Nothing matters
more than numbers!

01:25:42.015 --> 01:25:43.415
You should be thanking me!

01:25:43.448 --> 01:25:44.716
I should be thanking you?

01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:46.886
What about the profits
that you got from our work?

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.055
You chose your side,
little Padawan.

01:25:49.088 --> 01:25:52.959
And now, it's time for you to take
your place next to the Emperor.

01:25:52.992 --> 01:25:53.993
You get me, bro?

01:25:54.861 --> 01:25:58.197
Yeah, I get you... bro.

01:25:58.231 --> 01:26:00.766
Which leads me to this.

01:26:15.982 --> 01:26:17.183
Thanks, Keys.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.890
What the hell was that?

01:26:23.923 --> 01:26:26.625
Hey, Antwan,
things are getting hectic.

01:26:29.661 --> 01:26:32.531
Oh, I thought you were
smarter than this, Keys.

01:26:32.564 --> 01:26:34.766
You're obviously fired,
you know that.

01:26:34.801 --> 01:26:38.037
And you, what is she still
doing in the game, man?

01:26:38.071 --> 01:26:38.972
Boot everyone.

01:26:39.005 --> 01:26:41.374
Hold up. You want me
to boot all the players?

01:26:41.407 --> 01:26:43.309
Boot them out
of the game, now!

01:26:43.343 --> 01:26:45.078
Cancel every player account!

01:26:45.111 --> 01:26:46.779
And where the hell is Dude?

01:26:46.813 --> 01:26:49.782
Security! Kick this punk out.

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.621
Guy!

01:26:56.655 --> 01:26:58.523
- Millie!
- They're taking me out.

01:26:58.557 --> 01:26:59.993
What's happening?

01:27:00.026 --> 01:27:00.960
It's on you now.
Everybody's watching.

01:27:00.994 --> 01:27:02.028
You gotta keep going.

01:27:02.061 --> 01:27:04.563
Wait, wait, wait!
Will I see you again?

01:27:04.596 --> 01:27:06.232
You will if you make it
across that bridge.

01:27:06.264 --> 01:27:08.533
Show the whole world our build.
That's the proof.

01:27:08.567 --> 01:27:11.037
You do that, Antwan is done.

01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:12.071
I'll make it.

01:27:16.109 --> 01:27:17.176
I'll make it.

01:27:18.311 --> 01:27:19.511
What the hell?

01:27:21.147 --> 01:27:22.748
What's going on?

01:28:02.188 --> 01:28:06.625
All right, let's all remember this
moment, before we were fired.

01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:08.428
Oh!

01:28:08.461 --> 01:28:09.862
Wow.

01:28:14.934 --> 01:28:16.102
Catchphrase.

01:28:16.135 --> 01:28:17.769
<i>Catchphrase?</i>

01:28:17.804 --> 01:28:19.338
What? I haven't had time
to think one up yet.

01:28:19.372 --> 01:28:23.176
Although "catchphrase" as a catchphrase
is a pretty cool catchphrase.

01:28:27.346 --> 01:28:28.713
Whoa.

01:28:29.748 --> 01:28:32.919
Get up, Guy. Get up.

01:28:45.431 --> 01:28:47.300
Oh, no, no, no.

01:28:51.603 --> 01:28:54.874
Guy, I came to save you.

01:28:56.775 --> 01:28:59.145
- Who is this?
- I don't know.

01:28:59.178 --> 01:29:00.346
He's glorious.

01:29:01.948 --> 01:29:03.449
I mean, he's just like you...

01:29:03.483 --> 01:29:05.017
but way better.

01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:08.955
Way, way better.

01:29:08.988 --> 01:29:10.857
- Thank you.
- No, that's not a compliment.

01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:12.258
I wouldn't touch him
if I were you, Buddy.

01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:13.758
What do you mean you don't
think I should touch him?

01:29:13.793 --> 01:29:15.361
You don't mind this, do you?

01:29:15.394 --> 01:29:17.330
'Cause I'm your buddy, too.

01:29:21.033 --> 01:29:23.469
Yeah, I think he's
gonna... hit you.

01:29:23.503 --> 01:29:24.570
He punches so hard.

01:29:24.604 --> 01:29:25.704
But yet his hands are so soft.

01:29:25.737 --> 01:29:27.140
- Be strong.
- Okay, bye.

01:29:27.173 --> 01:29:29.408
Hey, it's like I'm a feather to him.

01:29:29.442 --> 01:29:31.077
Whee!

01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:32.478
Ha-ha!

01:29:35.548 --> 01:29:36.883
Oh...

01:29:40.419 --> 01:29:42.788
<i>No, no, no! No!</i>

01:29:42.822 --> 01:29:45.657
Get up, Guy, get up!

01:29:46.325 --> 01:29:47.692
Playtime's over.
Catchphrase.

01:29:47.726 --> 01:29:48.928
I don't know what that means.

01:29:51.531 --> 01:29:53.099
<i>Come on, man. Get up!</i>

01:29:53.132 --> 01:29:54.133
Get up.

01:29:55.234 --> 01:29:58.004
There are three things
I love in life.

01:29:58.037 --> 01:30:02.808
Kickin' ass, TBD,
third thing here.

01:30:06.812 --> 01:30:08.981
<i>Oof! Oh, shit!</i>

01:30:10.682 --> 01:30:12.351
Activate death blow.

01:30:12.385 --> 01:30:13.386
Bye, Guy.

01:30:18.024 --> 01:30:20.126
Oh, shit, that's a death blow.

01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:23.095
Get up!

01:30:23.129 --> 01:30:25.898
Mom, he's coming in
with a death blow!

01:30:28.801 --> 01:30:29.969
Get up, Guy.

01:30:36.008 --> 01:30:37.076
Oh.

01:30:39.078 --> 01:30:40.913
What the shit?

01:30:48.354 --> 01:30:49.754
That was dope.

01:31:05.805 --> 01:31:07.506
- Hold on. Is that...
- That's a...

01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:10.742
Yes! That's a
lightsaber, Dude.

01:31:10.775 --> 01:31:12.311
Mm-hmm.

01:31:16.983 --> 01:31:19.118
- Is that a lightsaber?
- It is.

01:31:55.021 --> 01:31:56.022
Oh!

01:32:02.428 --> 01:32:03.529
Guy!

01:32:05.431 --> 01:32:06.932
Yes!

01:32:06.966 --> 01:32:09.769
Yes! That's right.
Get up, Guy. Come on.

01:32:30.489 --> 01:32:31.490
There you go.

01:32:32.224 --> 01:32:34.293
Do you see them
all now? Yeah?

01:32:34.327 --> 01:32:35.661
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

01:32:35.695 --> 01:32:38.564
Yeah, shiny things everywhere.

01:32:39.899 --> 01:32:41.634
Yeah, there you go.
Go get it.

01:32:41.667 --> 01:32:43.736
Just lots of little snacks.

01:32:47.039 --> 01:32:50.743
Yeah, not a dancer. No.

01:32:50.776 --> 01:32:52.578
Run free, better me.

01:32:53.814 --> 01:32:55.247
Let's go.

01:32:55.281 --> 01:32:56.749
Where are we going?

01:32:56.783 --> 01:32:58.785
We can't let them
get across that bridge.

01:32:58.819 --> 01:33:00.553
You wanna finish
this out with me?

01:33:00.585 --> 01:33:03.790
Look, I don't even know what's going
on, but hell yes, I'm with you.

01:33:03.824 --> 01:33:05.558
Ha-ha!

01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:07.360
Let's go!

01:33:32.451 --> 01:33:33.753
Antwan, come on, man.

01:33:33.787 --> 01:33:36.254
What are we doing here?

01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:38.891
Where are the servers
to <i>Free City 1?</i>

01:33:38.924 --> 01:33:42.061
No. Antwan,
what the hell are you doing?

01:33:42.094 --> 01:33:45.799
If they get past that horizon to the
build, I lose everything!

01:33:45.832 --> 01:33:47.233
Wait, so you did
steal their code.

01:33:47.265 --> 01:33:49.803
Welcome to
the conversation, genius.

01:33:49.836 --> 01:33:51.504
Now, where are those servers?

01:33:51.537 --> 01:33:53.072
It's all of these, but hold on.
I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

01:33:53.105 --> 01:33:54.540
All these? This one?
Right, this one?

01:33:54.573 --> 01:33:55.941
Yeah. How did you...

01:34:02.348 --> 01:34:03.349
Run.

01:34:08.187 --> 01:34:09.188
Antwan!

01:34:19.498 --> 01:34:20.533
Stop!

01:34:23.536 --> 01:34:24.838
Officer Johnny!

01:34:24.871 --> 01:34:26.272
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:34:29.341 --> 01:34:32.011
Which server has the ocean
and the rest of the bridge?

01:34:32.044 --> 01:34:33.112
I'm not gonna tell you.

01:34:33.145 --> 01:34:34.213
You're just gonna destroy it.

01:34:34.246 --> 01:34:35.748
Yeah. 'Cause it's my game.

01:34:35.782 --> 01:34:39.084
Except it's not.
It's Keys' game.

01:34:39.118 --> 01:34:40.821
You didn't do shit.

01:34:40.854 --> 01:34:43.989
And guess what?
Keys is my boy.

01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:45.458
Security!

01:34:45.491 --> 01:34:48.929
Please escort this former
employee off the premises.

01:34:48.961 --> 01:34:50.996
He can call you
by your real name.

01:35:10.416 --> 01:35:12.017
Guy!

01:35:12.051 --> 01:35:13.954
- Buddy! Buddy!
- No, no! Keep going!

01:35:13.986 --> 01:35:15.956
Go without me!

01:35:15.988 --> 01:35:18.224
I've been scared
my whole damn life.

01:35:19.725 --> 01:35:21.660
But I'm not scared anymore.

01:35:24.831 --> 01:35:26.165
I'm sorry.

01:35:26.765 --> 01:35:28.167
I'm not.

01:35:30.903 --> 01:35:33.038
It's been the
best day of my life.

01:35:33.672 --> 01:35:35.508
You get to that build.

01:35:36.877 --> 01:35:38.444
You show 'em we matter.

01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:48.855
That security guard right
there was a goddamn hero.

01:37:28.855 --> 01:37:31.891
You did it!

01:37:40.165 --> 01:37:41.935
Yes! Yes!

01:37:41.968 --> 01:37:44.436
Suck it, Antwan! Whoo!

01:37:45.872 --> 01:37:47.439
Antwan, stop!

01:37:48.108 --> 01:37:49.508
It's over.

01:37:51.710 --> 01:37:53.312
He made it.

01:37:53.345 --> 01:37:57.316
Got your game's original build
out there for everyone to see.

01:37:57.349 --> 01:37:59.218
Probably win
your lawsuit, huh?

01:37:59.786 --> 01:38:00.887
Looks likely.

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:02.388
Cool.

01:38:02.421 --> 01:38:06.291
And here's the thing, bro.
Here's the thing.

01:38:06.325 --> 01:38:09.062
Right here, I got
everything you care about.

01:38:09.095 --> 01:38:13.298
The sliver that's left of <i>Free City,</i>
all your little background friends...

01:38:13.332 --> 01:38:15.768
including your
digital boyfriend.

01:38:16.635 --> 01:38:18.570
Last server.

01:38:18.603 --> 01:38:23.876
Look, I just want the world that
I built and the people in it.

01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:25.544
What's in it for Antwan?

01:38:25.577 --> 01:38:26.780
Everything else.

01:38:26.813 --> 01:38:28.613
Meaning? Pretend I'm dumb.

01:38:28.647 --> 01:38:31.084
You have the rights to our
code, keep all the profits...

01:38:31.117 --> 01:38:33.218
just give me
what's left of <i>Free City.</i>

01:38:33.251 --> 01:38:35.253
Let me build my
own world from there.

01:38:35.287 --> 01:38:39.125
What about <i>Free City 2?</i>
<i>Free City 3?</i>

01:38:39.159 --> 01:38:40.659
And all pursuant spin-offs?

01:38:40.693 --> 01:38:43.762
All yours.
Just put down the axe.

01:38:43.797 --> 01:38:46.432
You know that this is, like,
the dumbest deal

01:38:46.465 --> 01:38:48.901
in the history of
dumb deals, right?

01:38:48.935 --> 01:38:51.336
I mean, you're talking about
giving up millions of dollars.

01:38:51.370 --> 01:38:53.439
Why would anyone do that?

01:38:53.472 --> 01:38:55.842
'Cause Keys and I
made something great.

01:38:57.877 --> 01:39:00.980
And I don't need money or
fame to prove that to myself.

01:39:01.014 --> 01:39:03.950
I'm done playing
your game, Antwan.

01:39:06.186 --> 01:39:08.487
It's time I played mine.

01:39:09.621 --> 01:39:10.857
Deal?

01:39:19.899 --> 01:39:22.202
<i>Popping today
and not in a good way.</i>

01:39:22.267 --> 01:39:24.737
<i>Sales for</i> Free City 2
<i>continue to slip...</i>

01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:29.175
<i>with numerous reports of bugs in
the code and lagging online play.</i>

01:39:29.210 --> 01:39:31.543
<i>Embattled Soonami game founder
Antwan Hovachelik</i>

01:39:31.577 --> 01:39:32.979
<i>finds himself
in the crosshairs.</i>

01:39:33.012 --> 01:39:34.379
Crosshairs.

01:39:34.413 --> 01:39:36.215
He's in the crosshairs and embattled.

01:39:36.248 --> 01:39:37.649
We're too busy to gloat.

01:39:37.683 --> 01:39:39.551
<i>I'm a victim! I'm a victim!</i>

01:39:39.584 --> 01:39:41.487
Speaking of busy,
we just doubled

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.756
the amount of unique
visitors we can handle.

01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:44.690
It's amazing.

01:39:44.723 --> 01:39:46.391
Who'd have thought
that so many people...

01:39:46.425 --> 01:39:49.461
would just wanna watch video game
characters instead of shoot at them?

01:39:49.929 --> 01:39:51.030
Hmm...

01:39:51.898 --> 01:39:52.966
Oh, yeah, we did.

01:39:52.999 --> 01:39:54.767
Yeah.

01:39:55.802 --> 01:39:58.737
You know,
you're pretty cute when you brag.

01:39:58.771 --> 01:39:59.839
<i>Antwan out!</i>

01:39:59.873 --> 01:40:01.606
<i>Meanwhile, the game</i> Free Life

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.110
<i>is quickly becoming
the little indie that could.</i>

01:40:04.144 --> 01:40:07.546
<i>Players are swarming to this
observational, fishbowl game...</i>

01:40:07.579 --> 01:40:10.817
<i>where they interact peacefully with
the one and only Blue Shirt Guy...</i>

01:40:10.850 --> 01:40:14.120
<i>and is now no longer in the
background, a digital friend.</i>

01:40:14.154 --> 01:40:15.354
Uh, hey, Mills...

01:40:17.523 --> 01:40:19.959
Do you wanna come
grab a coffee with me?

01:40:19.993 --> 01:40:22.494
Actually, I'm gonna jump
back into the game.

01:40:24.164 --> 01:40:26.532
- Oh.
- Coffee?

01:40:26.565 --> 01:40:29.002
Okay. Yeah. Sounds good.

01:40:29.035 --> 01:40:30.602
I'll just, uh, grab you one.

01:40:31.104 --> 01:40:32.205
Oh, Keys, uh...

01:40:32.238 --> 01:40:33.940
I know, medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

01:40:33.973 --> 01:40:35.008
Yeah.

01:40:45.218 --> 01:40:47.619
Hi, Randy. Milton.

01:40:50.023 --> 01:40:51.757
Hmm.

01:40:51.791 --> 01:40:53.458
I was wondering
when I'd see you again.

01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:57.230
Yeah, life has
been pretty crazy lately.

01:40:57.263 --> 01:40:58.497
You should see it in here.

01:40:58.530 --> 01:41:00.900
We're talkin' free
bubble gum ice cream for life.

01:41:00.934 --> 01:41:02.701
Wow.

01:41:05.104 --> 01:41:06.105
Hey, guys.

01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:18.117
Look, Guy...

01:41:18.151 --> 01:41:20.485
Wow, this is harder
than I thought.

01:41:21.087 --> 01:41:22.822
Then let me do it for you.

01:41:23.655 --> 01:41:25.091
Guy...

01:41:27.759 --> 01:41:31.097
you are dreamy.

01:41:32.631 --> 01:41:37.203
Your taste in blue shirts and
five-octave musical superstars...

01:41:37.236 --> 01:41:41.506
it's deeply, deeply
attractive to me.

01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:44.077
But I can't keep spending
all my time with you.

01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:49.448
I created this world,
but I can't live my life in it.

01:41:53.987 --> 01:41:56.555
See? Was that so hard?

01:41:57.422 --> 01:41:59.491
So, what are you gonna do?

01:42:00.293 --> 01:42:02.996
Anything I want.
Thanks to you.

01:42:04.297 --> 01:42:06.032
I'm not stuck
in a loop anymore.

01:42:06.065 --> 01:42:07.666
Neither are you.

01:42:09.969 --> 01:42:12.638
I love you, Millie.

01:42:12.671 --> 01:42:16.109
Maybe that is my programming
talking, but guess what?

01:42:17.409 --> 01:42:19.779
Someone wrote that program.

01:42:21.747 --> 01:42:23.983
I'm just a love letter to you.

01:42:24.817 --> 01:42:27.552
Somewhere out there
is the author.

01:42:45.271 --> 01:42:49.175
<i>You brought him to life.
You brought him to life.</i>

01:42:49.208 --> 01:42:51.476
<i>And he was alive because
he met the one person</i>

01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:53.246
<i>he'd been waiting for
his whole life.</i>

01:42:53.279 --> 01:42:56.648
And I had to make it
realistic, so...

01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:59.718
I based it off of...

01:43:01.354 --> 01:43:02.554
you.

01:43:04.489 --> 01:43:06.625
The woman of his dreams...

01:43:09.262 --> 01:43:10.964
she was the same as mine.

01:43:10.997 --> 01:43:14.533
<i>So she liked bubble gum
ice cream and swing sets...</i>

01:43:14.566 --> 01:43:18.537
<i>and she had this very cute
but oddly specific habit...</i>

01:43:18.570 --> 01:43:22.008
<i>of always humming this
classic Mariah Carey track.</i>

01:43:22.041 --> 01:43:25.477
<i>Like, all the time,
she would... repeat.</i>

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:29.681
Finally!

01:43:36.322 --> 01:43:37.522
Keys!

01:43:45.497 --> 01:43:47.233
What are you...

01:44:28.174 --> 01:44:30.043
You okay, little guy Guy?

01:44:30.076 --> 01:44:31.811
You seem adjective.

01:44:31.844 --> 01:44:34.646
I'm great. I'm great.
You could put me down, by the way.

01:44:34.679 --> 01:44:36.516
Thank you. That was nice.

01:44:36.548 --> 01:44:40.119
No, I'm great.
You're great, Dude.

01:44:41.521 --> 01:44:43.456
I just miss my best friend.

01:44:44.824 --> 01:44:47.927
We used to do the same walk
together every day.

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.497
Except he wore a shirt.
And could complete a full sentence.

01:44:51.531 --> 01:44:53.132
I can bench press a sentence.

01:44:53.166 --> 01:44:56.836
Yeah, that's totally
not the same thing at all.

01:44:56.869 --> 01:44:59.138
Harder laughter!

01:44:59.906 --> 01:45:00.940
Oh...

01:45:00.973 --> 01:45:02.108
Guy?

01:45:04.676 --> 01:45:06.645
- Buddy!
- No!

01:45:06.678 --> 01:45:07.914
Oh, my God! Guy!

01:45:07.947 --> 01:45:09.515
Buddy! I thought I'd lost you!

01:45:09.549 --> 01:45:10.883
You didn't!

01:45:10.917 --> 01:45:12.919
One minute, I'm running on
a crazy bridge to nowhere...

01:45:12.952 --> 01:45:15.253
thinkin' my sweet
mundane life is over.

01:45:15.288 --> 01:45:18.057
The next minute, I'm like
in some type of flyin'...

01:45:18.091 --> 01:45:20.193
and some like fairy dust,
pixie dust...

01:45:20.226 --> 01:45:24.330
and then I plopped down
into this slice of heaven.

01:45:24.363 --> 01:45:26.933
Man, I love it here.

01:45:26.966 --> 01:45:29.502
In fact, a couple of days ago,
I rode a centaur.

01:45:29.535 --> 01:45:30.903
Now, it might sound weird...

01:45:30.937 --> 01:45:34.340
I took a piggyback ride on a
half-dude and a half-horse...

01:45:34.373 --> 01:45:36.675
whatever a centaur is,
I did it.

01:45:36.708 --> 01:45:38.244
I rode a dude, too!

01:45:38.276 --> 01:45:39.545
Friendly gesture!

01:45:39.579 --> 01:45:41.247
So friendly!

01:45:41.279 --> 01:45:42.681
Come on, bring it in!

01:45:42.714 --> 01:45:44.050
- Are we gonna hug?
- I'm coming for you!

01:45:44.083 --> 01:45:45.518
- No, you're not. I'm coming for you.
- Yes, I am!

01:45:45.551 --> 01:45:46.786
- You come here!
- I'm coming to you!

01:45:46.819 --> 01:45:48.554
I'm reeling you in.
I'm reeling you in.

01:45:51.690 --> 01:45:53.359
Buddy, I missed you!

01:45:53.392 --> 01:45:55.394
Hey, so where's the bank?

01:45:56.796 --> 01:45:58.297
There is no bank.

01:45:58.331 --> 01:45:59.799
So what do we do?

01:45:59.832 --> 01:46:02.068
Whatever we want.

01:46:10.710 --> 01:46:12.812
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Guy.
