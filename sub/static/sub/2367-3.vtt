00:21.396 --> 00:23.231
[soft music playing on speakers]

00:32.449 --> 00:33.992
Hi.

00:34.076 --> 00:36.995
Can I get a size 10 and a lane?

00:37.079 --> 00:39.081
Sorry. We're closing up.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.500
He's still playing.

00:42.585 --> 00:45.462
Mr. Prohaszka bowls when he wants to.
Worked it out with the owner.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.006
Can I join him for a few balls?

00:48.090 --> 00:49.883
You wanna ask,
knock yourself out.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.885
Be right back.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.807
Excuse me.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.144
I was just wondering if maybe
I could join you for a couple games?

01:01.228 --> 01:03.396
-Private game. You mind?
-No.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.441
Hey... sorry.

01:06.524 --> 01:09.361
I was just really looking forward
to throwing a few balls.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.154
Get this moron out of my face.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.449
Hey, come on.

01:14.532 --> 01:15.659
[exclaims]

01:15.743 --> 01:16.910
[grunting]

01:20.873 --> 01:21.915
[Prohaszka] Whoa, whoa. Hey!

01:23.584 --> 01:25.168
You got a bad attitude, friend.

01:35.303 --> 01:36.513
Mmm.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.849
[sniffing]

01:38.932 --> 01:39.933
[exhales]

01:40.809 --> 01:42.269
Love that smell.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.312
Metal and oil.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.983
Fresh, never been fired.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.027
Take a whiff.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.447
Like a good revolver better.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.117
No chance of jamming up.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.745
Man.

01:59.828 --> 02:00.829
Look at this.

02:00.913 --> 02:03.165
This is top of the line.

02:03.248 --> 02:08.128
I guarantee this baby will not jam
or my name ain't Turk Barrett.

02:09.046 --> 02:10.505
[gun clicks]

02:11.423 --> 02:12.424
[exclaims]

02:13.717 --> 02:14.885
[grunting]

02:14.968 --> 02:16.887
This is how he negotiates, huh?

02:34.029 --> 02:35.363
[screaming in pain]

02:44.206 --> 02:45.248
-[bones cracking]
-[screams]

02:47.793 --> 02:49.669
[grunting]

02:52.422 --> 02:53.924
[panting]

02:56.551 --> 02:58.636
[dispatcher on phone]
Police are on their way, miss. Stay calm.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.305
[gasps]

03:00.388 --> 03:01.598
Hello?

03:06.644 --> 03:08.772
[police siren wailing in the distance]

03:19.908 --> 03:21.952
[tires squealing]

03:27.124 --> 03:29.251
[wailing continues]

03:33.588 --> 03:35.340
[police officer 1]
Got him? Where is he?

03:35.423 --> 03:37.425
[police officer 2] Got him in sight.
He's right over there.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.637
-[police officer 1] Don't move!
-[guns cocking]

03:40.721 --> 03:42.055
[police officer 2]
Stay there!

03:42.139 --> 03:43.640
[police officer 3]
Keep your hands up!

03:43.724 --> 03:45.350
Dispatch, Victor 23...

03:45.433 --> 03:47.060
I want a lawyer.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.146
[theme music playing]

04:49.122 --> 04:50.958
[church bells ringing]

05:05.680 --> 05:07.432
You're Jack Murdock's kid, aren't you?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.978
It's all right.
Seal of Confession.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.772
Anything you said during
the sacrament of penance

05:14.857 --> 05:16.024
stays between us.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.945
Could've killed 10 people,
I couldn't tell anyone.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.363
That seem fair to you?

05:21.446 --> 05:23.156
Is what it is.

05:27.035 --> 05:30.080
-I have to get to work.
-Yeah, me, too.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.665
Wouldn't mind a cup of coffee
first, though.

05:32.749 --> 05:37.170
Chamber of commerce donated
one of those... fancy espresso machines

05:37.254 --> 05:39.797
for meetings and stuff.

05:39.882 --> 05:42.926
I make a heck of a latte,
if you're interested.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.805
Some other time, maybe.

05:50.433 --> 05:55.105
Seemed you had a lot on your mind
last time you were here.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.776
Sure you don't want that latte?

06:01.028 --> 06:02.779
Take care of yourself, Father.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.561
-Thought you'd forgotten about me, Urich.
-[chuckles]

06:34.644 --> 06:35.645
[man 1] Never happen.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.564
[man 2] I don't know.

06:37.647 --> 06:41.068
People's memories
these days ain't so good.

06:41.859 --> 06:46.239
Back in the day,
I couldn't wait to see this view.

06:46.323 --> 06:50.202
Me and the boys, driving in Friday nights.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.957
Kings of the castle.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.625
Kings don't have bodies in the trunk.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.502
Tell that to Macbeth.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.670
[chuckles]

07:01.463 --> 07:03.798
What's this about
you moving to Florida?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.301
Did you hear about Rigoletto?

07:06.384 --> 07:07.635
Heard he retired.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.763
Yeah... in pieces.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.812
-Somebody putting it to you?
-You know the rules.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.859
-Is it the Russians?
-The rules.

07:22.943 --> 07:27.489
You go first... and then maybe
I got something to say.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.699
That's the way it's always been.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.205
Russians got a bee up their ass.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.499
Somebody's been hitting them... hard.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.709
Mostly around the docks.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.670
Wasn't Rigoletto,
that what you're thinking.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.758
So who are we looking at?

07:48.135 --> 07:49.636
You tell me.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.307
I don't know.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.726
Been scratching at it.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.562
Police reports get altered.
Public records, too.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.816
But I know a pattern
when it shoves a thumb in my eye.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.528
A new player, maybe?

08:06.611 --> 08:10.657
Used to be if you killed a man,
you sent his wife flowers.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.868
Now they just send his wife with him.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.459
You know something,
don't you?

08:21.543 --> 08:22.544
Yeah.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.922
Florida's beautiful
this time of year.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.385
[Ben sighs]

08:31.511 --> 08:32.845
The rules.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.765
There are no rules, Benny.
Not anymore.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.352
So that's it?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.897
That's all I get?

08:42.980 --> 08:45.692
You know, when I went away to do my 10,

08:45.775 --> 08:50.155
every newspaper in town
dragged my name through the shit.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.948
You were the only one who did it...

08:53.658 --> 08:56.453
without mentioning my kids.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.458
Always grateful for that.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.752
Then give me something.

09:04.836 --> 09:07.464
A name... anything.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.593
Take a pass on this one, Benny.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.011
Some fights will just get you bloody.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.118
[door opens]

09:37.827 --> 09:38.911
[Foggy sighs]

09:40.497 --> 09:42.374
You know the whole,
"Let's stay out all night," thing?

09:42.457 --> 09:43.875
Yeah.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.211
How about next time
we skip the part with the eel?

09:46.294 --> 09:47.920
[chuckles] Deal.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.298
Hey, what do you think about
getting a sign on the door?

09:50.382 --> 09:52.759
-Well, you got a sign.
-A real one.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.303
[scoffs]
You should get some clients first.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.347
Just one little sign.
What could it cost?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.056
Frank, you can barely afford to pay me.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.808
I thought you were working for free.

10:00.892 --> 10:04.646
I... I did... for a day.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.314
[door opens]

10:06.398 --> 10:09.901
-Hey... you know she's not really free?
-Hey.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.487
[Foggy] Jesus. What happened to your eye?

10:12.570 --> 10:15.407
-Oh. Are you okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

10:15.490 --> 10:18.243
I just wasn't paying attention
last night. It's my fault.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.369
You need a dog.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.663
-[scoffs] I'm not getting a dog.
-[Foggy] What?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.290
You don't like dogs?
Who doesn't like dogs?

10:23.373 --> 10:24.457
I... I love dogs.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.209
[Foggy] Everybody loves dogs.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.627
[knocking on door]

10:29.671 --> 10:31.881
Was that a knock?

10:32.882 --> 10:34.008
Someone's at the door.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.468
Our door?

10:35.552 --> 10:36.553
Uh...

10:37.345 --> 10:38.346
Karen?

10:40.973 --> 10:42.309
Right.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.518
Okay.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.566
Hi.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.069
Do you do walk-ins?

10:54.028 --> 10:56.281
[man] I represent a consortium with

10:56.364 --> 10:58.200
diversified interests
in the private sector,

10:58.283 --> 11:00.202
both domestic and international.

11:00.285 --> 11:04.539
From time to time, we scout the landscape
for promising talent to put on retainer.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.666
-[chuckles] Retainer?
-Mmm.

11:06.749 --> 11:07.750
[Matt] Why are you approaching us?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.752
Why not a larger firm, Mr., uh...

11:09.836 --> 11:12.214
Confederated Global Investments
is my employer.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.131
It's not what I was asking.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.383
[man chuckles]

11:15.467 --> 11:18.511
[man] It's the only name relevant
to this discussion, Mr. Murdock.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.596
Oh.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.473
So, why us?

11:21.556 --> 11:27.354
Obviously, the larger firms aren't able
to provide the same hands-on attention

11:27.437 --> 11:29.397
that we pride ourselves on
at Nelson and Murdock.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.148
[man] It's a fair question.

11:31.233 --> 11:34.569
I'm here because my employer
does extensive business in Hell's Kitchen,

11:34.652 --> 11:37.405
and who knows it better
than two local boys

11:37.489 --> 11:38.823
who graduated from Columbia Law,

11:38.906 --> 11:41.368
cum laude and summa cum laude?

11:41.451 --> 11:43.370
Uh, the "summa" part is politics.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.621
[chuckles]

11:44.704 --> 11:46.956
You set up shop
right here in your backyard

11:47.039 --> 11:51.127
despite the fact that both of you
were made a very lucrative offer

11:51.210 --> 11:53.129
from Landman and Zack in Manhattan
where you interned.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.464
You've done your homework.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.424
My employer expects no less.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.760
Then forgive me for being blunt.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.762
[stammers] "Blunt" is a strong word.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.640
In my line of work,
I find it refreshing.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.267
What is that line of work exactly?

12:05.350 --> 12:11.063
What my partner is trying to say is
we're still building a practice,

12:11.147 --> 12:13.691
so we're very particular
about our clientele.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.444
I assure you,
all my employer wants

12:16.528 --> 12:20.990
is for you to continue
to be ethical, decent men...

12:21.073 --> 12:22.575
good lawyers.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.369
And for that, for nothing more than

12:24.452 --> 12:27.455
your exceptional skills
and your discretion...

12:29.791 --> 12:32.001
you'll be fairly compensated.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.011
[Foggy] Uh-huh.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.346
[chuckles]

12:43.430 --> 12:45.432
It's... It's fair.
That's... That's fair.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.310
Your partner doesn't seem convinced.

12:49.226 --> 12:52.522
Like Foggy said,
we're particular about our clientele.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.861
I'm curious about
your... clientele.

12:58.945 --> 13:02.156
Do they all end up working for you
after you get them off for murder

13:02.239 --> 13:04.492
or just the pretty ones?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.664
You, uh, give us a minute, please?

13:11.624 --> 13:12.625
Um...

13:22.427 --> 13:25.012
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset anyone.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.724
How did you know about
Miss Page's situation?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.225
She was never charged.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.477
There was nothing in the papers.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.894
[man] I have friends on the force.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.646
I hear I'm not the only one.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.858
I think we might be
veering off the subject.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.860
I understand your concerns,
Mr. Murdock.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.447
Perhaps... you should
review one of our cases...

13:42.530 --> 13:43.865
before you make a decision?

13:43.948 --> 13:45.282
Peace of mind and whatnot.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.744
That's a fantastic idea.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.078
Matthew?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.914
Yeah, what harm could it do?

13:51.998 --> 13:54.000
Excellent.

13:54.083 --> 13:58.963
You have... 38 minutes
to get to Precinct 15.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.883
[Foggy] What? Now?
What's the case?

14:03.175 --> 14:05.720
Everything you need is in this file.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.101
Thank you for your time.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.270
No. Thank you.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.606
Thank you very...

14:16.689 --> 14:18.232
[door closes]

14:18.315 --> 14:19.692
What is your problem?

14:19.776 --> 14:21.068
He wouldn't even
give us his name, Foggy.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.530
You wouldn't care if you could see
the zeroes on this check.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.782
-Yeah, maybe you would if you couldn't.
-We're running out of time.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.324
-I'll meet you there.
-Meet me? [stammers]

14:27.409 --> 14:29.035
The hell are you going?

14:29.118 --> 14:30.119
Matt!

14:38.920 --> 14:40.547
[watch ticking]

15:01.067 --> 15:03.570
It's been taken care of, sir.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.029
[ticking stops]

15:39.814 --> 15:41.983
[Foggy] So what exactly happened,
Mr. Healy?

15:42.066 --> 15:43.485
In your own words.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.613
All I wanted was
to throw a few balls.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.740
The lady at the shoe counter
will tell you the same.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.157
She also says that

15:50.241 --> 15:53.495
you crushed the deceased's skull
with a bowling ball.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.329
Self-defense.

15:55.412 --> 15:59.333
The man and his... whatever they were,
they threatened my life.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.086
They threatened you how?

16:02.169 --> 16:03.880
Verbally? Physically?

16:04.506 --> 16:05.882
Which sounds better?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.259
Excuse me?

16:09.636 --> 16:12.221
They threatened me
both verbally and physically.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.018
[clears throat]

16:18.478 --> 16:25.109
So... you say you... didn't know
or have never met Mr... Prohaszka

16:25.192 --> 16:27.737
-prior to last night?
-No...

16:27.820 --> 16:32.950
but I do regret any injurious consequences
my actions may have caused.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.831
You have quite the legal vocabulary,
Mr. Healy.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.793
Am I right in assuming
this isn't your first rodeo?

16:42.877 --> 16:44.336
I had issues.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.675
I'm better now.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.594
[exhales deeply]

16:53.095 --> 16:56.641
On second thought...
Mr. Healy, uh...

16:56.724 --> 16:59.018
perhaps our firm
isn't the right fit for you.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.728
Sorry I'm late. [clears throat]

17:00.812 --> 17:01.854
Uh, no, no, that's...

17:01.938 --> 17:05.107
I was just explaining
to Mr. Healy that, uh...

17:05.191 --> 17:06.984
we have a full caseload
right now, so we--

17:07.068 --> 17:08.778
We'd be happy to
represent you, Mr. Healy.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.780
-What?
-We're taking the case.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.574
[clears throat] Uh...

17:12.657 --> 17:15.284
Why don't we start from the beginning?
Tell me everything you know.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.623
I understand the policy
has an allotment of days,

17:20.707 --> 17:25.002
but last time we spoke,
I was told I could request an extension.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.881
-This was last month, yes.
-[door opens]

17:33.469 --> 17:35.221
What's the new form called?

17:37.932 --> 17:39.016
From the website.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.518
Of course. Thanks.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.482
Insurance talk?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.109
It's the worst.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.319
I remember, uh,
with my kids and the dentist.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.613
Yeah.

17:51.696 --> 17:55.366
Yeah. Got a minute
to talk about next week's spread?

17:55.449 --> 17:56.701
Already working on it.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.661
Another organized crime thing?

17:59.662 --> 18:01.873
All of Hell's Kitchen.

18:02.707 --> 18:06.543
There's a new player on the scene.
No one knows who it is or what they want.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.420
Everybody's scrambling.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.172
Your assignment's
the city desk, Ben.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.759
This is the city.
No one else is on this yet.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.677
I'm the only one who sees it.

18:14.761 --> 18:15.803
It's not sexy.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.806
We're a newspaper, Ellison,
not a girlie mag.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.726
You know that's not what I meant,
and nobody calls them that anymore.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.186
It's not just the Russians.

18:24.270 --> 18:28.024
I think maybe the Union Allied scandal
might tie into this.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.819
Right, and you remember
what that exposé did for circulation?

18:31.903 --> 18:33.821
Dick with a side of,
"Who gives a shit?"

18:33.905 --> 18:35.572
This is a real story.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.784
Yeah, and it's gonna end
the same as it always does, right?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.619
A bunch of fat old guys
in some white-collar prison

18:39.702 --> 18:40.912
with more fat old guys.

18:40.995 --> 18:44.791
The cops aren't even on this yet.
We could be the ones to connect the dots.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.960
It doesn't sell papers, Ben.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.421
Not anymore.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.052
I want you on the subway line piece.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.557
"Rumors bubbling.

19:01.641 --> 19:05.144
Will Hell's Kitchen
finally get a subway line?"

19:05.227 --> 19:07.479
Come on, we tell that every year.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.732
-And every year, it kills.
-For a fluff piece.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.276
You know, you like to
be on the ground, right?

19:12.359 --> 19:14.528
You like to talk to people.
Take a poll.

19:15.947 --> 19:16.989
What color do they like?

19:17.073 --> 19:18.741
You know, we got a blue line,
we got a yellow line.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.826
We're running out of colors.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.452
Like M&M's?

19:21.535 --> 19:23.287
Yeah, see?
You'll write the hell out of it.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.582
There used to be a time

19:26.666 --> 19:30.670
when the people in this building
wrote the hell out of the news.

19:32.546 --> 19:36.467
Everybody we know...
is making twice what we are

19:36.550 --> 19:40.096
writing for blogs,
working from home in their underwear.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.809
We're hanging on
by our fingertips, Ben.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.186
You really want to be
greasing that ledge?

19:53.901 --> 19:55.444
Make it visual, all right?

19:55.527 --> 19:59.448
I'll call down to Graphics,
see if I can drum up a chart.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.702
Oh, and, um...

20:02.785 --> 20:04.829
I'll put in a call
to the insurance drones,

20:04.912 --> 20:06.873
see what I can do, okay?

20:15.464 --> 20:16.758
[sighs]

20:20.052 --> 20:23.931
Would you like us to reiterate the terms
of attorney-client privilege, Mr. Healy?

20:24.015 --> 20:26.183
Think I got it.

20:26.267 --> 20:29.812
Then you know anything you tell us
stays in this room.

20:29.896 --> 20:30.980
Just like church.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.028
You must be a very important man.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.155
That a question?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.447
Statement.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.283
It's not every day
a global investment firm

20:42.366 --> 20:44.035
picks up the tab
for a murder suspect.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.702
Self-defense.

20:46.703 --> 20:49.581
I wonder if you could shed some light
on the man that hired us to represent you.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.708
-Don't think I can, counselor.
-Can't or you won't?

20:51.793 --> 20:54.628
Maybe we should focus on
details pertinent to the case?

20:54.711 --> 20:55.838
Just trying to build a solid defense,

20:55.922 --> 20:58.507
and the connection between Mr. Healy
and the man that came to our offices

20:58.590 --> 21:00.634
might just help prove his innocence.

21:00.717 --> 21:01.886
How?

21:02.929 --> 21:06.348
Maybe they're old friends.
Maybe he's a character witness.

21:06.432 --> 21:10.311
Or maybe you were in his employment
at the time of the incident.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.814
I just wanted to throw a few balls,
just like I keep saying.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.606
You go bowling often,
Mr. Healy?

21:15.232 --> 21:16.650
When the mood hits.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.153
And the deceased,
he had no motive that you recall?

21:19.236 --> 21:20.822
[exhales deeply]

21:20.905 --> 21:21.989
No.

21:22.073 --> 21:24.700
You didn't provoke him
intentionally or otherwise?

21:24.784 --> 21:26.953
Are we breaking for lunch
anytime soon?

21:27.453 --> 21:30.456
Are you at all afraid of what might happen
if we lose this case, Mr. Healy?

21:31.833 --> 21:32.875
No.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.587
Are you?

21:37.421 --> 21:38.547
[Foggy breathing deeply]

21:39.841 --> 21:41.508
Matt, a word, please?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.184
[Matt clears throat]

21:51.811 --> 21:53.187
We should not be doing this.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.147
-Doing what?
-Defending professional criminals.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.024
You're the one that keeps saying
we need real clients.

21:57.108 --> 22:01.028
That's not a client.
It's a shark in a skin suit.

22:01.112 --> 22:02.446
You pegged it
back at the office.

22:02.529 --> 22:04.031
There's something off
about this whole thing.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.324
We agreed to represent him, Foggy.

22:05.407 --> 22:08.619
We're gonna try this case
and let the jury take it from there.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.246
Mr. Healy...

22:10.997 --> 22:12.248
Uh... [clears throat]

22:13.457 --> 22:17.003
I suggest we waive
criminal procedure law 180.80,

22:17.086 --> 22:19.463
give the DA more time
to explore a plea.

22:19.546 --> 22:20.547
In the meantime,

22:20.631 --> 22:23.843
the best thing for you to do
is to be forthcoming with us.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.094
Together, we'll confront the charges

22:25.177 --> 22:29.473
honestly, openly and within
the moral confines of the law.

22:29.556 --> 22:30.892
Does that sound good to you?

22:30.975 --> 22:32.101
[sighs]

22:32.184 --> 22:33.310
No.

22:33.394 --> 22:36.272
-Excuse me?
-I want the 180.80 date.

22:36.939 --> 22:39.942
If I'm indicted,
which we know I will be,

22:40.026 --> 22:43.362
we'll waive all hearings and discovery
and go directly to trial.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.366
Not my first rodeo, remember?

22:47.950 --> 22:49.285
You'll need to testify.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.538
I'm just gonna have faith
in our judicial system...

22:53.830 --> 22:55.832
and you're gonna do your jobs.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.628
-That simple?
-That simple.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.713
And, uh...

23:01.797 --> 23:04.800
as for the man
who hired you...

23:04.883 --> 23:07.511
all you need to know is...

23:07.594 --> 23:09.555
his check's gonna clear.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.369
Wait your turn, man.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.970
I got next.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.816
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.573
[Foggy] You wanna tell me
what the hell's going on with you?

24:09.656 --> 24:12.118
First you decide
we're taking the case unilaterally

24:12.201 --> 24:17.206
and then you cross-examine the guy
like we're playing bad cop/worse cop.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.833
If we want to keep the lights on,
we gotta take some cases for the money.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.252
You were right about that.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.336
Okay, for the record,

24:22.419 --> 24:25.047
this is the first time
you've ever said I was right.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.215
I hate it.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.592
Sometimes, we have to
do things we aren't proud of.

24:28.675 --> 24:32.721
Yeah, but... this can't
become what we do.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.932
Yeah, I know.

24:36.017 --> 24:38.352
And we have to be on the same team,
making decisions together.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.105
I got carried away.
I'm sorry, Foggy.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.606
It's okay.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.571
-So?
-Okay.

24:49.655 --> 24:52.241
So assuming he's indicted,
which, yeah,

24:52.324 --> 24:54.618
it's on the DA to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

24:54.701 --> 24:56.828
that it wasn't self-defense,

24:56.912 --> 24:58.164
shoe girl's DD-5 says that

24:58.247 --> 25:00.624
she didn't come out of the back room
until after the fight had started,

25:00.707 --> 25:01.917
which helps us.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.044
And what about
Prohaszka's men?

25:03.127 --> 25:05.337
They lawyered up.
Wouldn't give a five.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.714
Since when do the victims of an assault
not give a statement?

25:07.798 --> 25:09.258
Another chit in our favor.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.177
Plus Healy's pretty banged up.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.386
Argue defensive wounds,

25:12.469 --> 25:15.764
which makes it look more like a fight
and less like an execution.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.310
So, you open, I'll sum up.

25:19.393 --> 25:20.727
And we should cash that check,

25:20.811 --> 25:23.772
have Karen see what she can find out
about Confederated Global.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.023
Right.

25:26.858 --> 25:29.320
Where the hell is she?

25:30.279 --> 25:31.988
[man] It's a fairly simple form.

25:32.073 --> 25:33.532
Here you agree, in writing,

25:33.615 --> 25:37.161
to never again disclose information
regarding your former employer,

25:37.244 --> 25:39.913
the dissolved entity known as
Union Allied Construction,

25:39.996 --> 25:42.416
or any of its affiliates.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.959
Upon execution of this agreement,

25:44.042 --> 25:46.170
the corporate interests,
as they currently exist,

25:46.253 --> 25:48.755
agree not to pursue
legal action against you.

25:48.839 --> 25:49.840
Against me?

25:49.923 --> 25:51.883
Well, you signed
a non-disclosure agreement

25:51.967 --> 25:53.719
the day you were hired, Miss Page.

25:53.802 --> 25:54.803
Everybody did.

25:54.886 --> 25:58.890
Not everyone broke that agreement
and distributed confidential information.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.768
I... I exposed criminal activity.

26:01.852 --> 26:05.356
And had you taken that information
to any law enforcement agency,

26:05.439 --> 26:06.857
your rights may have been protected,

26:06.940 --> 26:11.653
but instead... you went to
the New York Bulletin,

26:12.404 --> 26:14.323
a privately-owned
news organization.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.700
I had nothing to do
with that article.

26:16.783 --> 26:20.329
So the file you illegally removed
from the premises of Union Allied

26:20.412 --> 26:23.457
wasn't the same one
Mr. Urich refers to in this?

26:26.001 --> 26:29.296
You see how this
complicates things, yes?

26:31.965 --> 26:35.177
Daniel Fisher was murdered
and your clients--

26:35.261 --> 26:38.430
I assure you that any illegal activity
associated with Union Allied

26:38.514 --> 26:41.099
has been dealt with,
thanks very much to you.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.604
You're welcome.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.106
If you'd like, you can take these
to your own representatives,

26:48.190 --> 26:50.901
but I'm fairly certain
they'll advise you to sign it.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.528
And as a show of good faith,

26:52.611 --> 26:56.072
my clients would like to offer you
a lump sum of six months' salary.

26:56.157 --> 26:57.449
For what?

26:57.533 --> 26:59.660
For all your help
in the matter

26:59.743 --> 27:02.120
and for any stress
these events may have caused.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.748
Stress?

27:04.831 --> 27:06.208
Someone tried to kill me.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.461
And while my clients acknowledge
no involvement with that individual

27:09.545 --> 27:12.214
or claim legal responsibility
for his actions,

27:12.298 --> 27:15.176
they do feel
it's their non-binding moral obligation

27:15.259 --> 27:19.221
to offer you a chance
at rebuilding your life.

27:21.390 --> 27:25.519
As long as I keep my mouth shut?

27:25.602 --> 27:27.604
It's a clean slate, Miss Page...

27:29.481 --> 27:31.983
a chance to put it all behind you.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.988
Now, isn't that what you want?

27:47.208 --> 27:50.752
Private rooms are hard to come by, Ben.
Especially this time of year.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.046
She can't be in a communal.
She needs hands-on.

27:53.129 --> 27:54.798
Yeah, well,
you are lucky after all this time

27:54.881 --> 27:56.300
that they are still
covering you at all.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.844
They said, in some cases,
it's possible to get an extension.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.638
[scoffs] Well, they say a lot of crap.
Mostly just to get you off the phone.

28:01.722 --> 28:02.973
I already filled out the forms.

28:03.056 --> 28:05.309
I just need you
to approve them.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.519
Yeah, okay.
This is the first step.

28:07.603 --> 28:10.188
There are 1,000 more after this,
and I've got a hospital to run.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.441
If I stop to fill out every appeal,
I am going to be--

28:12.524 --> 28:14.860
They're gonna
cut her off, Shirley.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.987
It's not her fault.

28:18.239 --> 28:20.449
Come with me.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.827
It is not like we are
throwing her out on the street.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.454
[Ben] Not yet.

28:25.537 --> 28:29.500
But the next thing you know,
the communal ward is at capacity,

28:29.583 --> 28:31.752
then she gets pushed
to an out-patient facility.

28:32.378 --> 28:35.213
I know there's a limit to what you can do,
to what I can afford.

28:35.297 --> 28:40.261
I just want to make sure she can rest,
so she can get better...

28:40.344 --> 28:42.429
so she can come home.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.354
Okay.

28:53.399 --> 28:56.402
Five days.
That's what this will buy you.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.615
-And the appeal?
-No promises, okay?

29:01.698 --> 29:04.868
Now get the hell out of my office.
I have got a measle outbreak to deal with

29:04.951 --> 29:07.246
because idiot parents
don't want to vaccinate

29:07.329 --> 29:10.957
and my best nurse is out
with who the hell knows what.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.418
Uh...

29:12.501 --> 29:13.710
What's that?

29:13.794 --> 29:15.462
Cheese blintz from
that place you like.

29:15.546 --> 29:18.214
-You should have led with that.
-That'd be cheating.

29:18.299 --> 29:19.841
Yeah.

29:38.652 --> 29:41.280
-Hey. She had a good day.
-Yeah?

29:41.363 --> 29:44.825
She was up half an hour.
Asked about you.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.414
[Matt] Let's pull section 35.15
of the Penal.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.790
35.15.

30:33.874 --> 30:37.419
Then we'll take our facts
and fit them to the CJI and the statute.

30:38.462 --> 30:39.921
[sighs heavily]

30:41.465 --> 30:42.466
Got the insights?

30:42.549 --> 30:43.884
It's still loading.

30:44.426 --> 30:47.303
-We need better Wi-Fi.
-We need better everything.

30:47.388 --> 30:48.680
Let's do that.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.517
Let's win cases,
be popular and make money.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.395
-It's not about that, Foggy.
-I know...

30:54.936 --> 30:58.357
but it could be...
just a little, a smidge.

31:00.651 --> 31:03.028
Hey, uh... Wi-Fi's acting weird.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.030
You find out anything
on Confed Global?

31:05.739 --> 31:09.159
Yeah, uh, it's a subsidiary
of a holding company

31:09.242 --> 31:14.122
of a loan-out to a holding subsidiary
and on and on and on.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.708
But that dickhead's check
cleared in about two seconds.

31:17.501 --> 31:19.210
There's your money.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.507
Bang on the router, will you?

31:25.426 --> 31:28.429
Oh, hey, no more long lunches
until this is over, okay?

31:29.763 --> 31:31.139
You got it.

31:35.936 --> 31:37.312
[Karen banging on router]

31:39.898 --> 31:41.066
[beeps]

31:42.401 --> 31:47.739
All right, practice insights for
New York State Penal Law 35.15.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.161
And in the state of New York,
I'll remind you,

31:53.244 --> 31:58.625
that my client is not required to prove
that he was justified in his actions.

31:58.709 --> 32:05.131
Instead, it's up to the prosecution
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt

32:05.215 --> 32:07.926
that he was not justified
in defending his life.

32:08.009 --> 32:13.306
And they will come nowhere close
to meeting this burden.

32:13.389 --> 32:16.685
At the end of this case...

32:16.768 --> 32:21.482
the only verdict that you can render
will be not guilty.

32:23.066 --> 32:26.361
[judge] Members of the jury,
this is an important case,

32:26.445 --> 32:29.656
and I have a few additional comments
that I want you to consider.

32:29.740 --> 32:32.743
If you should fail
to agree upon a verdict,

32:32.826 --> 32:34.536
we will be forced to...

32:34.620 --> 32:36.997
[heart pounding]

32:40.542 --> 32:42.293
[watch ticking]

33:16.452 --> 33:18.747
This will all be over soon, okay?

33:18.830 --> 33:21.457
Just keep it together till the verdict.
Can you do that?

33:24.377 --> 33:26.212
Look, you ask me,

33:26.296 --> 33:28.048
it's almost like
they're doing you a favor.

33:29.090 --> 33:33.178
I mean, you don't want
something like that floating around.

33:34.387 --> 33:35.430
[sighs]

33:35.514 --> 33:38.725
Go home.
Get some rest.

33:38.809 --> 33:40.519
You got a big day tomorrow.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.704
[grunting]

33:58.787 --> 33:59.996
[groans]

34:00.080 --> 34:01.206
Stay down.

34:02.123 --> 34:03.166
Ahhh!

34:03.249 --> 34:04.626
I said stay down.

34:04.710 --> 34:05.919
You son of a bitch!

34:07.128 --> 34:09.089
What do you have on her?

34:09.172 --> 34:10.506
[panting]

34:10.591 --> 34:12.508
[groaning]

34:12.593 --> 34:14.970
A tape!
There's a tape, okay?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.512
What's on it?

34:16.597 --> 34:18.765
A mistake she made
when she was 19 and pretty,

34:18.849 --> 34:21.101
something she don't want
her kids to know about.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.061
-You get rid of it.
-I can't.

34:23.144 --> 34:26.356
-[screaming in pain]
-It's not a discussion.

34:26.439 --> 34:28.900
It won't make a difference anyway.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.737
-Who do you work for?
-I don't know.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.739
-Ahhh!
-I want a name.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.406
There isn't one!

34:37.075 --> 34:39.578
That isn't how this works!

34:39.661 --> 34:42.205
Look, I walk by a building,

34:42.288 --> 34:45.375
if a light's on in the window,
I got a job.

34:52.716 --> 34:53.759
Somewhere...

34:53.842 --> 34:56.678
there's another light
in another building.

34:56.762 --> 35:00.098
I don't do this.
I'm somebody else's job.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.183
You tell her to get herself
excused from the jury.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.895
Personal reasons,
whatever it takes.

35:04.978 --> 35:07.981
After that,
she never sees you again.

35:08.982 --> 35:10.275
They'll kill me.

35:10.358 --> 35:13.403
Then you'd better
leave my city... tonight.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.157
[grunts]

35:18.324 --> 35:19.325
[groaning]

35:25.916 --> 35:29.795
The court grants the motion
to excuse juror number eight from service

35:29.878 --> 35:33.840
due to extenuating
personal circumstances.

35:33.924 --> 35:37.678
The first alternate juror
will replace her.

35:39.512 --> 35:42.015
Would the defense care
to make a closing argument?

35:43.516 --> 35:46.477
Yes, Your Honor.
Thank you.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.458
[heart beating]

36:14.422 --> 36:16.632
What the hell is he doing?

36:28.103 --> 36:30.105
[judge] Mr. Murdock,
we're waiting.

36:31.147 --> 36:33.441
Sorry, Your Honor.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.110
[sighs]

36:35.193 --> 36:38.321
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
forgive me if I seem distracted.

36:39.655 --> 36:44.369
I've been preoccupied of late
with, uh, questions of morality...

36:44.452 --> 36:47.330
of right and wrong,
good and evil.

36:49.499 --> 36:53.586
Sometimes the delineation
between the two is a sharp line.

36:53.669 --> 36:56.172
Sometimes it's a blur...

36:56.256 --> 36:58.925
and often it's like pornography.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.511
You just know
when you see it.

37:01.594 --> 37:02.929
[people laughing]

37:04.347 --> 37:05.348
A man is dead.

37:07.225 --> 37:11.562
I don't mean to make light of that,
but these questions...

37:11.646 --> 37:14.649
these questions...

37:14.733 --> 37:16.192
are vital ones...

37:16.276 --> 37:20.280
because they tether us
to each other... to humanity.

37:21.281 --> 37:22.741
Not everyone feels this way.

37:22.824 --> 37:26.494
Not everyone sees the sharp line,
only the blur.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.079
A man is dead. Um...

37:29.831 --> 37:31.624
A man is dead.

37:31.707 --> 37:33.919
And my client, John Healy...

37:34.920 --> 37:36.087
took his life.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.132
This is not in dispute.

37:39.215 --> 37:44.179
It is a matter of record... of fact...
and facts have no moral judgment.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.430
They merely state what is.

37:45.513 --> 37:48.183
Not what we think of them,
not what we feel.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.685
They just are.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.521
What was in my client's heart
when he took Mr. Prohaszka's life,

37:53.604 --> 37:56.649
whether he is a good man
or something else entirely,

37:56.732 --> 37:57.776
is irrelevant.

37:58.693 --> 38:03.990
These questions... of good and evil,
as important as they are,

38:04.074 --> 38:05.741
have no place
in a court of law.

38:05.826 --> 38:07.786
Only the facts matter.

38:07.869 --> 38:11.164
My client claims he acted in self-defense.

38:11.247 --> 38:13.083
Mr. Prohaszka's associates have refused

38:13.166 --> 38:14.584
to make a statement
regarding the incident.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.920
The only other witness,
a frightened young woman,

38:17.003 --> 38:19.672
has stated that my client
was pleasant and friendly,

38:19.755 --> 38:23.927
and that she only saw the struggle
with Mr. Prohaszka after it had started.

38:24.928 --> 38:26.847
Those are the facts.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.099
Based on these...

38:29.182 --> 38:31.226
and these alone,

38:31.309 --> 38:34.145
the prosecution has failed to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt

38:34.229 --> 38:37.232
that my client was not acting
solely in self-defense.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.568
And those,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

38:40.651 --> 38:42.570
are the facts.

38:44.614 --> 38:45.824
My client,

38:45.907 --> 38:51.287
based purely on the sanctity of the law
which we've all sworn an oath to uphold...

38:51.371 --> 38:54.040
must be acquitted
of these charges.

38:54.124 --> 38:57.085
Now, beyond that,
beyond these walls...

38:58.378 --> 39:02.548
he may well face
a judgment of his own making.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.634
But here...

39:04.717 --> 39:07.095
in this courtroom...

39:07.178 --> 39:09.472
the judgment is yours...

39:10.640 --> 39:12.267
and yours alone.

39:21.985 --> 39:25.113
[Leland] I need to talk to him.
[man] He sends his apologies.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.782
I don't care about his...

39:27.866 --> 39:30.451
Where is he?
This needs attention.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.996
He's indisposed.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.455
With what?

39:36.124 --> 39:37.833
Art.

39:37.918 --> 39:39.294
Art who?

39:40.628 --> 39:41.880
Paintings.

39:42.797 --> 39:45.884
-His penthouse is finally ready...
-You're shitting me.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.261
Everything's spinning out of whack
and he's decorating?

39:48.344 --> 39:51.597
The situation is under control, Leland.

39:51.681 --> 39:54.309
You've lost your strong-arm
and the tape.

39:54.392 --> 39:58.521
-You got nothing on juror eight now.
-She's only a piece of the puzzle.

39:58.604 --> 40:01.441
You ever try putting a puzzle together
with a piece missing?

40:01.524 --> 40:04.110
It's damned aggravating.

40:04.194 --> 40:06.654
I don't see why we're
going through all of this anyway.

40:06.737 --> 40:10.200
Just get rid of Healy
the way you got rid of the other guy.

40:10.283 --> 40:14.454
They find him hanging in his cell,
boom-boom, case closed.

40:14.537 --> 40:17.999
Rance, Fisher, McClintock, Farnum.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.126
We've been leaving
a trail of bodies lately,

40:20.210 --> 40:23.463
and trails eventually
lead somewhere.

40:23.546 --> 40:28.509
This... this needed to be handled quietly,
within the confines of the law.

40:28.593 --> 40:31.554
So you hire a couple of
back-door shysters?

40:32.305 --> 40:33.639
I know 100 defense attorneys

40:33.723 --> 40:36.226
with more experience
than Heckle and Jeckle.

40:36.309 --> 40:39.270
[scoffs]
It's not their experience that matters.

40:39.354 --> 40:43.316
They just opened shop
and they're completely clean.

40:43.399 --> 40:47.028
Say that about any of the
other 100 you know? Huh?

40:48.196 --> 40:51.950
Two lawyers...
above reproach.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.785
Self-defense.
No questions, no trail.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.787
There's too much light
shining on this.

40:56.871 --> 41:00.833
I can't move on Prohaszka's holdings
until the glare is off.

41:00.916 --> 41:03.211
Get the papers ready...

41:03.294 --> 41:05.546
and let my employer
worry about the rest.

41:05.630 --> 41:06.839
[sighs]

41:15.515 --> 41:16.807
Mrs. Fisher?

41:18.893 --> 41:20.353
Hi.

41:20.436 --> 41:24.107
-Um, uh... My name's Karen--
-I know who you are.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.904
I'm sorry.

41:29.988 --> 41:33.574
I know how... hard
this must be for you.

41:33.658 --> 41:34.659
[scoffs]

41:35.451 --> 41:37.870
My husband was found dead
in your apartment.

41:37.953 --> 41:40.581
You have no idea
how any of this is for me.

41:40.665 --> 41:43.709
Nothing ever happened
between me and Daniel.

41:43.793 --> 41:46.712
You think I don't know that?
I know how much Danny loved me.

41:46.796 --> 41:49.340
Whatever it is you're after,
Miss Page, I can't help you.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.552
Union Allied?

41:55.596 --> 41:57.973
They offered me money...

41:58.599 --> 42:01.519
a lot of money...

42:01.602 --> 42:06.399
if I sign an agreement to
never talk about what happened.

42:07.775 --> 42:10.111
They offer you something like that?

42:13.781 --> 42:15.116
They killed Danny.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.576
They tried to kill me.

42:16.659 --> 42:19.995
And now they just shuffle some papers
and change their name

42:20.080 --> 42:21.539
and they get away with it?

42:22.707 --> 42:25.210
-Let it go.
-I've tried.

42:27.170 --> 42:29.714
It just doesn't feel right.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.177
He said the same thing.

42:34.260 --> 42:36.429
A few days before he...

42:37.097 --> 42:42.602
He said something didn't feel right...
at work with the numbers...

42:42.685 --> 42:44.229
and I told him that whatever it was,

42:44.312 --> 42:47.982
he had a responsibility
to do something about it.

42:49.650 --> 42:52.987
I figure I have a couple years
before I explain that part to my kids.

42:53.071 --> 42:54.905
They have to pay for
what they've done.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.657
-They won't listen.
-We'll make them listen.

42:56.741 --> 42:58.618
I already signed.

43:00.161 --> 43:03.164
I have two kids, Miss Page,
and they're all that matter to me now.

43:04.832 --> 43:07.877
If you have anyone
that you care about...

43:07.960 --> 43:10.546
let it go.

43:23.476 --> 43:27.647
Shirley, thanks so much
for pushing this through.

43:28.231 --> 43:30.941
I... I owe you one.

43:31.025 --> 43:32.943
Okay, thanks. Bye.

43:42.036 --> 43:43.078
[knocking on door]

43:43.163 --> 43:44.164
[sighs] Yeah.

43:45.831 --> 43:48.376
[Karen] Excuse me, Mr. Urich?

43:50.085 --> 43:51.629
So they tell me.

43:51.712 --> 43:52.755
[sighs]

43:52.838 --> 43:54.840
I read your article.

43:56.301 --> 43:58.511
-About the subway line?
-Uh...

43:58.594 --> 44:01.347
About Union Allied Construction.

44:02.557 --> 44:03.641
I, um...

44:04.767 --> 44:07.937
I think there's more to the story...

44:08.020 --> 44:10.315
if you're interested.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.113
Please be seated.

44:31.043 --> 44:32.753
[watch ticking]

44:36.841 --> 44:38.801
[heart pounding]

44:50.563 --> 44:51.772
They're hung.

44:51.856 --> 44:54.859
Madam Foreperson,
it's my understanding from this note

44:54.942 --> 44:57.445
that you have been
unable to reach a verdict.

44:57.528 --> 45:00.072
We have not, Your Honor.

45:00.155 --> 45:02.575
Allen charge.
She's sending them back in.

45:02.658 --> 45:04.577
Still split, DA will retry.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.704
No, they won't.

45:06.787 --> 45:07.955
Will they, Mr. Healy?

45:08.038 --> 45:10.916
That was a hell of a speech
you gave, Murdock.

45:12.084 --> 45:14.169
A hell of a speech.

45:14.254 --> 45:15.546
[judge]
The trial has been expensive

45:15.630 --> 45:19.509
for time, effort, money,
and emotional strain

45:19.592 --> 45:22.887
to both the defense
and the prosecution.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.472
If you should fail...

45:25.723 --> 45:27.642
[Latin music playing over speakers]

45:42.114 --> 45:43.616
[exclaiming]

45:48.579 --> 45:49.872
[grunting]

46:01.592 --> 46:03.344
[metal clanging]

47:10.327 --> 47:13.623
The man that hired your lawyers,
who does he work for?

47:14.540 --> 47:15.833
You think I'm afraid of you?

47:17.084 --> 47:18.753
[screams in pain]

47:21.213 --> 47:22.214
[groans]

47:25.300 --> 47:26.636
Tell me!

47:28.388 --> 47:29.639
Who does he work for?

47:30.180 --> 47:32.266
-I can't!
-I want a name!

47:33.768 --> 47:35.352
[groaning]

47:35.436 --> 47:37.563
Oh, God! Fisk!

47:37.647 --> 47:39.732
Wilson Fisk! [grunting]

47:41.275 --> 47:42.693
[breathing heavily]

47:42.777 --> 47:43.986
[glass shatters]

47:44.069 --> 47:45.488
[exhales]

47:47.573 --> 47:49.074
[coughing]

47:49.158 --> 47:50.743
You get in your car.

47:50.826 --> 47:52.495
If I ever see you
in Hell's Kitchen again--

47:52.578 --> 47:53.704
No.

47:53.788 --> 47:55.581
You do not want to test me.

47:55.665 --> 47:57.875
You think this is
still about you?

47:58.876 --> 48:01.921
I gave up his name.
You don't do that, not to him.

48:04.089 --> 48:06.467
He'll find me...

48:06.551 --> 48:09.136
and make an example...

48:10.137 --> 48:13.683
and then he'll find everyone
I've ever cared about...

48:14.892 --> 48:17.311
and do the same to them...

48:20.648 --> 48:23.443
so that no one ever does
what I just did.

48:24.652 --> 48:26.028
[panting]

48:30.365 --> 48:32.201
You should have just killed me.

48:34.704 --> 48:36.956
You coward.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.083
[exclaims]

48:47.216 --> 48:48.300
[mumbles]

48:50.177 --> 48:52.805
[gasping]

49:02.523 --> 49:05.109
[classical music playing on speakers]

49:29.800 --> 49:32.553
There's an old children's joke.

49:32.637 --> 49:36.473
You hold up a white piece of paper
and you ask, "What's this?"

49:39.143 --> 49:41.687
"A rabbit in a snowstorm."

49:45.190 --> 49:46.817
You interested
or just looking?

49:47.735 --> 49:49.945
[man] Interested.

49:50.029 --> 49:52.322
People always ask me
how can we charge so much

49:52.406 --> 49:55.367
for what amounts
to gradations of white.

49:55.450 --> 50:00.205
I tell them it's not about
the artist's name or the skill required...

50:01.498 --> 50:03.959
not even about the art itself.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.838
All that matters is...

50:09.799 --> 50:11.842
"How does it make you feel?"

50:21.226 --> 50:23.437
It makes me feel alone.

50:39.036 --> 50:41.038
[dramatic music playing]
