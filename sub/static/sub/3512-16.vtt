and the train
wasn't running back to my place,

you can't move back in here.

Actually, there are many reasons,

Ah. I told you
I would help you with that.

Dad, it's fine. I can handle it.

but now that she's alone,

why not dump the dump and come home?

[ Chuckling ] Well, maybe
she's enjoying her independence.

01:33.153 --> 01:34.887
She doesn't have time for independence.

Well, Castle,

Maybe it's pride.

01:42.362 --> 01:43.362
If it were pride,

01:43.396 --> 01:45.264
she'd be more... well, proud.

Housekeeping found this guy,
Justin Marquette,

His driver's license
says he lives nearby.

Single gunshot to the chest?

02:06.786 --> 02:08.086
One is all it took.

02:08.121 --> 02:11.822
Based on the entry wound,
I'd say a small-caliber handgun.

And he wasn't found until morning?

So how come no one heard the shot?

02:19.698 --> 02:21.198
All the neighboring rooms are empty.

02:21.233 --> 02:24.402
The manager says that the place
is only about 40% occupied.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.437
Did the manager mention
him checking in with anyone?

02:26.472 --> 02:27.972
The room was in his name alone.

Ryan's trying to track down

02:32.043 --> 02:33.277
There's no sign of forced entry, though.

02:33.311 --> 02:35.246
So either the killer was with him,

02:35.280 --> 02:36.647
- or the victim let him in.
- Yeah.

02:39.151 --> 02:41.051
It looks like he took a bottle of water

from this mini-fridge,
turned back around, got shot,

02:45.222 --> 02:46.990

with him.

came at about 8:00.

Jane, tell them about the room.

Well, that was unusual.

03:09.180 --> 03:11.047
He asked to stay in room 147.

03:11.081 --> 03:12.381
In fact, he insisted on it.

03:12.416 --> 03:14.017
Is there anything special about 147?

03:14.051 --> 03:15.518
No, all our rooms are identical.

03:15.552 --> 03:16.852
That's why it was so strange.

03:16.886 --> 03:18.020
Had he been here before?

03:18.054 --> 03:19.355
Well, he's not in the system,

03:19.389 --> 03:20.889
which means he's never been a guest

03:20.924 --> 03:22.558
at any Best Traveler hotel.

03:22.592 --> 03:24.259
Did he mention why he was staying?

03:24.294 --> 03:25.594
He didn't have to.

03:25.629 --> 03:29.365
Good-looking guy, no bags,
checking in for one night?

03:29.399 --> 03:32.034
In my experience, that means
he was here to hook up.

03:32.068 --> 03:33.902
Did he come here with anyone?

03:33.937 --> 03:35.170
No, but he was texting with someone.

I figured that's who he was meeting.

There.

03:47.083 --> 03:49.451
See? He's texting.

03:49.485 --> 03:50.852
On a flip phone.

03:50.886 --> 03:53.555
That's not the phone we found.

03:53.589 --> 03:55.289
As far as I can tell,

03:55.324 --> 03:57.565
that's the only cellphone
registered to Justin Marquette.

03:57.593 --> 04:00.695
So the one we saw in the video
must be a second, secret one.

04:00.730 --> 04:02.597
Which the killer took
to hide their identity.

04:02.631 --> 04:04.031
So who is this guy,

04:04.066 --> 04:07.601
why a second phone, and why room 147?

because...

And he did not want to
talk about it, either.

07:08.044 --> 07:09.811
this case had conspiratorial promise.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.080
Well, most likely Justin was cheating
on his girlfriend with Anita,

07:12.114 --> 07:13.481
and the two of them met up at the hotel,

to try to tie her to the hotel,
except her credit-card records

show that she was at
Le Fagio restaurant last night.

07:32.935 --> 07:34.569
So maybe someone else
used her credit card.

07:34.603 --> 07:36.837
Nah. The manager I.D.'d her.

And he said that she split
the bill with another guy,

that they were together
from 9:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M.

But that's our entire
time-of-death window.

If that's true,
then Anita can't be our killer.

to go over this in person,

to give me the water, and I...

I shot him in the chest.

He looked surprised.

He staggered back.

09:34.730 --> 09:36.364
He dropped the bottle of water,

09:36.398 --> 09:38.900
and he kind of gripped onto
the back of this chair.

- From the bald man.
- No, from me.

11:01.915 --> 11:04.049

I just had this awful feeling
that I was gonna hurt him.

I'm completely theory-less.

Maybe Anita suffered
some kind of psychotic break.

12:07.044 --> 12:08.411
I've ordered a psych eval,

How do you account for that?

Okay. Well, then...

27:35.563 --> 27:38.966
do you know this man, Justin Marquette?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.168
I'm afraid not.

27:41.202 --> 27:45.038
What about this man, Miles Madsen?

27:45.072 --> 27:46.406
I understand he works for you.

27:46.440 --> 27:51.511
Mr. Madsen has not been employed
by E.H.I. for some time...

27:51.546 --> 27:53.547
years, in fact.

27:53.581 --> 27:55.649
Well, what did Mr. Madsen do
when he worked for you?

27:55.683 --> 27:57.917
Since he is no longer in my employ,

27:57.951 --> 27:59.518
I don't see the relevance.

27:59.553 --> 28:00.687
The relevance

28:00.721 --> 28:03.422
is that he is connected
to a murder investigation.

28:03.456 --> 28:07.160
I'm struck by the level
of your hostility, detective.

28:07.194 --> 28:08.627

is asking about your employee.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.103

28:32.618 --> 28:33.651
Wow. That's...

28:33.686 --> 28:35.620
amazing how you would just know that

28:35.654 --> 28:37.089

member of my E.H.I. family.

28:46.665 --> 28:48.533
along with the records
that you have on Miles Madsen.

28:48.567 --> 28:51.269
You'd need a warrant for that, detective,

You really think E.H.I.'s
grand pooh-bah is behind this?

29:23.006 --> 29:25.140
I think that he knows where Madsen is

29:25.174 --> 29:27.376

is still working for him.

that they have programs

quit drinking, uh,

assertiveness issues...

29:48.906 --> 29:51.374

gone through E.H.I. to treat.

29:51.409 --> 29:53.176
But they all claim that they didn't.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.244
But what if they did?

29:55.279 --> 29:56.879
What if they did,

29:56.914 --> 29:59.849
but something made E.H.I.
want to eliminate

29:59.883 --> 30:02.185

30:02.219 --> 30:05.421
Torn date-book pages, wiped calendars.

30:05.455 --> 30:08.624
Maybe that's why Madsen
went to their apartments...

30:08.658 --> 30:12.194
to erase any trace
of their connection to E.H.I.

30:12.228 --> 30:14.430
Castle, you can't just do that
by wiping out calendars.

30:14.464 --> 30:15.931
You'd have to... wipe memories.

over the last two weeks.

So y... you're saying that
a glorified self-help group

30:24.140 --> 30:26.308

30:26.343 --> 30:28.210
With drugs.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.178
Anita Miller's tests came back.

30:30.213 --> 30:32.848

of a Propranolol derivative

30:32.882 --> 30:33.949
in her system,

30:33.983 --> 30:36.117

and Mr. Carruthers.

30:36.152 --> 30:38.619
It was in their blood, as well.

30:39.655 --> 30:40.788
Propranolol?

30:40.823 --> 30:42.958
In small doses, it's mainly
a blood-pressure drug.

30:42.992 --> 30:44.759
In high doses, it's been found
to alter memories,

30:44.793 --> 30:46.527

30:46.562 --> 30:48.730
If it can alter memories,
could it make someone believe

30:48.764 --> 30:50.598

30:50.632 --> 30:51.866
Under normal circumstances,

31:07.648 --> 31:09.816
while erasing any knowledge
of their connection to E.H.I.

31:09.851 --> 31:11.618
Castle, do you have any idea
how insane that sounds?

31:11.652 --> 31:14.088
It's a diabolical plan.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.423
Have three suspects
confess to the same crime,

31:16.457 --> 31:18.324
making it impossible
for the police to arrest anyone.

how they all knew the details

What if Justin's killer
filmed the murder

31:30.671 --> 31:32.105
and then showed it to these people

31:32.139 --> 31:33.940
while they were in
their drug-induced state?

31:33.974 --> 31:35.541
They would think the images were drawn

31:36.643 --> 31:38.744
If they were shown the actual murder,

all three of them witnesses.

32:22.855 --> 32:24.522
I remember the carpet. It was beige.

32:24.557 --> 32:27.725
The wallpaper
had a subtle floral pattern,

above the fridge.

The viewer was supposed to

36:12.402 --> 36:14.169
project their problems on a person...

36:14.204 --> 36:15.337
in this case, Justin.

36:15.371 --> 36:17.707
That's why Anita blamed him
for her drinking,

36:17.741 --> 36:20.710
and... and why he was the focus
of Sam's anger issues.

36:20.744 --> 36:22.979
I knew it. You were implanting memories.

No, it was supposed to

by literally shooting them dead.

one for women and another for men.

36:32.222 --> 36:35.056
For the therapy to work,
we had to put subjects

in a chemically induced suggestive state

36:37.627 --> 36:41.296
while showing them this footage,
uh, but it was just too real.

36:41.331 --> 36:44.833
They began to internalize
the experience.

36:44.867 --> 36:46.428
And then they... they started to believe

36:46.435 --> 36:47.568
they'd actually killed Justin.

36:47.603 --> 36:49.303
We... we halted the program immediately.

Is that why you sent madsen

37:15.463 --> 37:17.931
Madsen only talked with Justin

37:17.966 --> 37:20.567
to remind him
of the confidentiality agreement

We do.

38:01.108 --> 38:04.077
We now believe that Justin was killed

38:04.111 --> 38:05.511
because of a video that he acted in.

38:05.545 --> 38:07.112
A video?

38:07.146 --> 38:08.980
It was made for an organization
called E.H.I.,

38:09.015 --> 38:12.451

edited by Kahn Post Production.

38:19.292 --> 38:20.392
We think you do.

38:20.427 --> 38:22.060
And when you saw the video,

38:22.095 --> 38:23.428
you saw an opportunity.

38:23.462 --> 38:25.797
Pam, we checked your credit card.

38:25.832 --> 38:28.700
We know that
you just bought a flip phone.

38:28.735 --> 38:30.702
So?

38:30.737 --> 38:32.570
So just before Justin died,

38:32.605 --> 38:35.373
he was texting someone on a flip phone,

38:35.407 --> 38:36.541
presumably his killer.

38:36.575 --> 38:38.175
Beckett: When we looked into
the phone records,

38:38.210 --> 38:41.279
there were texts supposedly
from E.H.I. to Justin,

38:41.313 --> 38:45.149
offering him $5,000 to
reprise his role in that video.

38:45.183 --> 38:48.753
I'm betting that you gave Justin
that phone,

38:48.787 --> 38:52.690
probably told him someone from E.H.I.
dropped by, wanted him to have it.

38:52.725 --> 38:55.025
But it wasn't E.H.I. that
sent those texts. It was you.

38:55.060 --> 38:58.863
You lured him to that hotel,
and then you killed him.

E.H.I. was to blame,

39:13.444 --> 39:14.778
but no one was held accountable.

39:14.812 --> 39:17.614
His death was ruled accidental.
