01:02.001 --> 01:04.250
Are you seriously
trying to rope-a-dope me?

01:04.251 --> 01:05.875
That's an old man's move.

01:05.876 --> 01:08.250
- I am old man.
- No, you're not.

01:08.251 --> 01:09.668
But you box like one.

01:13.126 --> 01:14.125
Not bad.

01:14.126 --> 01:16.001
Come on. Keep your guard up. Come on.

01:20.001 --> 01:21.918
Come on, Ben. You're telegraphin'.

01:23.668 --> 01:24.793
Mr. President.

01:25.459 --> 01:27.042
Ten minutes, sir.

01:27.043 --> 01:28.001
Thank you.

01:28.543 --> 01:29.834
Thank you, Forbes.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.251
Hey.

01:34.168 --> 01:35.542
You're not supposed
to hit the president.

01:35.543 --> 01:37.459
Yeah. I know.

01:39.168 --> 01:40.542
I'll get you next time.

01:40.543 --> 01:42.126
Yeah. I'm sure you will.

01:45.168 --> 01:46.543
Perimeter's secure.

01:50.709 --> 01:53.875
Weather's getting worse out there,
but we're advised it's drivable.

01:53.876 --> 01:55.543
Post vehicles to stand by.

02:01.418 --> 02:03.542
Good evening, Mr. President.
Five minutes, sir.

02:03.543 --> 02:04.208
Thanks, Mike.

02:04.209 --> 02:06.542
- Evening, ma'am.
- Merry Christmas, Mike.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.875
The president gets us off our
dependence on foreign oil...

02:08.876 --> 02:11.168
yet he cannot help
a wife choose an earring.

02:11.668 --> 02:15.001
Uh, small one.
Classic look for a classic lady.

02:16.251 --> 02:17.459
Good chat.

02:18.126 --> 02:19.251
Kiss ass.

02:20.501 --> 02:23.209
Well, I love you both
but I am going with the long.

02:26.293 --> 02:28.375
I hate going to these fundraisers.
Why don't you go for me?

02:28.376 --> 02:31.751
Oh, honey. You're perfect.

02:34.959 --> 02:37.209
God forbid people know we kiss.

02:48.459 --> 02:52.626
Now the real bloodbath starts
when your mom catches you playing this.

02:54.459 --> 02:55.626
You suck.

02:56.209 --> 02:58.251
You suck worse. Come on.

02:59.501 --> 03:01.250
Well,
he likes it when you call him Dries...

03:01.251 --> 03:03.417
because it makes him feel like,
I don't know, you're pals or something.

03:03.418 --> 03:06.167
Hey, love.
You wanna open a gift before we go?

03:06.168 --> 03:08.750
It's not love, and I'm gonna wait
'til everyone else is here.

03:08.751 --> 03:10.417
Keep forgetting. Sorry.

03:10.418 --> 03:13.208
Do I really have to come with you guys?
I mean, I've been on so many.

03:13.209 --> 03:15.000
Re-election's hard work, buddy.

03:15.001 --> 03:16.292
Sorry, pal.

03:16.293 --> 03:17.834
Can I at least ride with Mike?

03:19.793 --> 03:21.876
You'll have to ask him. He's the boss.

03:23.126 --> 03:24.626
Mike, do I get to ride with you?

03:26.584 --> 03:28.084
Okay. All right.

03:29.459 --> 03:33.125
Okay, Diaz.
You're riding in the Beast tonight.

03:33.126 --> 03:34.209
Merry Christmas.

03:34.918 --> 03:36.375
Thank you, sir.

03:36.376 --> 03:38.958
You okay to stay back
and watch the fort tonight?

03:38.959 --> 03:41.042
You kidding me? In this weather?

03:41.043 --> 03:43.417
Get out of this monkey suit,
sit by the fire,

03:43.418 --> 03:45.958
watch "Breaking Bad?" Fine by me.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.876
My own little retirement party?

03:50.293 --> 03:52.168
Leave the babysitter alone, all right?

03:52.459 --> 03:54.750
- Are you going to wear that hat?
- I like the hat.

03:54.751 --> 03:56.917
I think it's fine.
It's age appropriate.

03:56.918 --> 03:59.793
- You take it off when you get inside.
- No, the girls dig it.

04:00.501 --> 04:01.917
Mustang, this is Big Top.

04:01.918 --> 04:03.626
Bringing out the full package.

04:04.168 --> 04:05.084
Let's go.

04:06.709 --> 04:08.126
Package is on the move.

04:30.751 --> 04:33.418
ETA to Morgan residence, 22 minutes.

04:33.793 --> 04:35.293
Keep it tight, everybody.

04:38.168 --> 04:41.625
Hey, Connor. Come on.
Scoot back. Put your belt on.

04:41.626 --> 04:42.625
What if I don't?

04:42.626 --> 04:45.251
Then O'Neil here's gonna punch
in the nuts. Come on.

04:47.751 --> 04:49.667
You keeping 180 degrees awareness?

04:49.668 --> 04:51.500
I thought you said it was 360.

04:51.501 --> 04:52.833
Yeah, I was just checkin'.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.750
Setting me up is what you're doing.

04:54.751 --> 04:57.750
All right. So, how many emergency exits

04:57.751 --> 04:59.208
- in the West Wing?
- 8.

04:59.209 --> 05:01.875
How many feet from the Oval Office
to the PEOC elevator?

05:01.876 --> 05:03.500
116.

05:03.501 --> 05:04.833
From doors closing in the elevator,

05:04.834 --> 05:06.375
how long does it
take to get to the PEOC?

05:06.376 --> 05:07.458
Four minutes.

05:07.459 --> 05:09.583
Security cameras? How many have audio?

05:09.584 --> 05:11.042
Only the ones in the common areas.

05:11.043 --> 05:12.917
- Not bad.
- Kid's got it, huh?

05:12.918 --> 05:15.792
Yeah, we're gonna make
a Secret Service agent outta you yet.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.667
You just need to remember
to keep your seatbelt on.

05:17.668 --> 05:18.626
That's right.

05:28.751 --> 05:30.543
Gosh, it's really coming down.

05:36.793 --> 05:39.126
I've been thinking about shaving my head.

05:39.834 --> 05:41.293
That sounds good.

05:43.834 --> 05:46.209
It's getting worse out there. Bring it down to five.

05:49.709 --> 05:51.709
Merry Christmas, Mr. President.

05:53.376 --> 05:54.751
You shouldn't have.

06:02.168 --> 06:05.542
My God. It's my grandfather's watch.

06:05.543 --> 06:07.001
How did you find this?

06:07.918 --> 06:09.543
Just have my ways.

06:10.293 --> 06:11.167
Thank you.

06:11.168 --> 06:12.668
You're just welcome.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.709
Now, let's talk about that shaved head idea.

06:18.168 --> 06:19.167
You were listening.

06:19.168 --> 06:19.833
You didn't think I was listening,

06:19.834 --> 06:21.334
- did you?
- Very clever.

06:24.584 --> 06:27.667
You ever been to a billionaire's
Christmas party before, Diaz?

06:27.668 --> 06:30.292
- No, sir.
- They're over-rated.

06:30.293 --> 06:31.293
Yes, sir.

06:32.584 --> 06:34.209
Oh, my gosh.

06:34.793 --> 06:35.959
Look what I found.

06:36.626 --> 06:38.293
Where'd that come from?

06:39.043 --> 06:40.334
Merry Christmas.

06:53.501 --> 06:54.876
Stop, stop, stop!

07:07.209 --> 07:09.043
Hey, Connor, stay right there!

07:13.626 --> 07:15.042
Clear communications, it's Diaz.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.000
- First lady's injured.
- Connor.

07:16.001 --> 07:18.292
Get some weight on the back!
O'Neil, get on the back!

07:18.293 --> 07:19.709
I'm gonna get this door!

07:20.251 --> 07:22.501
- Don't anybody move inside! Don't move!
- Mike! Maggie!

07:31.876 --> 07:33.333
- Sir?
- Seatbelt's stuck!

07:33.334 --> 07:35.458
Sir, get out of the car!
I'll take care of her!

07:35.459 --> 07:37.167
Keep your weight on the back, O'Neil!

07:37.168 --> 07:39.125
- Hold it back!
- Roma, open the fucking door!

07:39.126 --> 07:42.083
It's jammed! It's fucking jammed!
Pull her out that side!

07:42.084 --> 07:43.958
It's going down! it's going down!

07:43.959 --> 07:46.876
O'Neil, goddamn it!
Hold it down! Hold it down!

07:49.543 --> 07:52.001
- Mike, it's going!
- Hold it back!

07:52.959 --> 07:54.584
Mike, take Maggie!

07:55.084 --> 07:56.708
Shit. Sir, I'm sorry!

07:56.709 --> 07:58.418
- Watch out, it's going!
- Maggie!

07:59.876 --> 08:01.251
No, Mike!

08:08.043 --> 08:10.709
No!

08:31.709 --> 08:33.333
Mom!

09:46.668 --> 09:47.876
I'm sorry.

09:49.793 --> 09:50.876
Yeah.

09:51.459 --> 09:54.876
And I don't like going to
barbecues by myself, you know?

10:02.084 --> 10:06.000
North Korean maneuvers along the DMZ
continue to ring alarm bells...

10:06.001 --> 10:09.000
throughout Pacific markets,
even as President Asher...

10:09.001 --> 10:12.042
is set to meet this afternoon
with South Korean...

10:12.043 --> 10:14.709
Babe, we out of coffee?

10:15.584 --> 10:17.376
I don't know. Are we?

10:17.959 --> 10:22.001
All right, just...
I thought you said that anything...

10:27.793 --> 10:28.876
You were saying?

10:29.459 --> 10:32.418
I was saying, I'll get some more coffee.

10:33.084 --> 10:34.043
Great.

10:35.334 --> 10:38.333
So, how was the barbecue I missed?

10:38.334 --> 10:40.917
It was actually kind of fun.
You might have enjoyed it.

10:40.918 --> 10:41.918
Yeah?

10:42.584 --> 10:44.958
Paula's got this new boyfriend
who's very sweet...

10:44.959 --> 10:47.750
but he's working in the same department
as her ex, Alex.

10:47.751 --> 10:49.042
Remember Alex?

10:49.043 --> 10:52.333
Anyway,
Alex ended up showing up at the party...

10:52.334 --> 10:56.501
which was really weird for Paula,
who was...

10:58.126 --> 10:59.459
overwhelmed.

11:01.543 --> 11:04.208
Mike, you're not listening to me.

11:04.209 --> 11:05.167
I was listening.

11:05.168 --> 11:05.833
You were talking about

11:05.834 --> 11:07.875
- patty's boyfriend and she's...
- No.

11:07.876 --> 11:11.043
Paula and Paula's boyfriend.
You've met Paula.

11:11.668 --> 11:13.918
It's okay, Mike.
We'll talk about it later.

11:14.293 --> 11:15.793
All right, babe. I'm sorry.

11:17.918 --> 11:20.583
But I tell you what.
Why don't we go see a movie tonight?

11:20.584 --> 11:22.293
Okay? Just the two of us.

11:23.626 --> 11:27.333
Or you can bring Paula and Patty
and their boyfriends.

11:27.334 --> 11:28.876
You know what I think we should do?

11:29.501 --> 11:33.125
I think we should take that holiday
that we've been talking about.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.375
All right?

11:34.376 --> 11:37.543
You, me, the ocean.

11:38.084 --> 11:41.168
Come on. It'll be like the honeymoon
we never had.

11:43.168 --> 11:45.001
We didn't have a honeymoon?

12:03.709 --> 12:04.668
Thanks.

12:05.126 --> 12:07.293
So, how was your Fourth?

12:08.043 --> 12:09.583
My fourth what?

12:09.584 --> 12:11.583
Fourth of July. Don't be an ass.

12:11.584 --> 12:13.958
Some people do take holidays, you know.

12:13.959 --> 12:17.000
Yeah, it was quiet.
You know, we stayed in.

12:17.001 --> 12:17.959
We?

12:18.501 --> 12:21.375
Okay. I stayed in. She went out.

12:21.376 --> 12:22.958
I'm shocked.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.167
Ms. Jacobs?

12:24.168 --> 12:25.125
- Good morning.
- Director.

12:25.126 --> 12:26.208
- How are you, buddy?
- Hey, Roma.

12:26.209 --> 12:27.500
- Good to see you, partner.
- How's the family?

12:27.501 --> 12:29.125
- The kids are good. Thank you.
- Yeah.

12:29.126 --> 12:30.376
- O'Neil.
- Hey, Banning.

12:30.876 --> 12:31.875
You're looking sharp.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.500
So, we missed you for, poker,
uh, last week. Where were you?

12:34.501 --> 12:35.333
Missed taking your money.

12:35.334 --> 12:37.626
Yeah, I know.
I've been working the late shift.

12:38.209 --> 12:40.834
Yeah, non-stop action over there
at the Treasury.

12:41.293 --> 12:42.792
You gotta do what you gotta do, right?

12:42.793 --> 12:44.917
Yeah.
You guys got a big day coming up, huh?

12:44.918 --> 12:46.667
You got the Koreans coming in?

12:46.668 --> 12:49.167
Nah, I mean, you know.
Business as usual.

12:49.168 --> 12:50.792
Hey, I wanted to introduce you.
This is Agent Jones.

12:50.793 --> 12:52.375
You've heard of Mike Banning,
haven't you?

12:52.376 --> 12:53.458
Yeah, yeah. The guy who told

12:53.459 --> 12:55.418
the Speaker of the House
to go fuck himself.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.042
Don't you guys have somewhere to be?

13:00.043 --> 13:01.625
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:01.626 --> 13:03.250
- Hey, Mike. Good seein' you.
- Yeah, you too.

13:03.251 --> 13:05.167
- Come Thursday night, all right?
- Okay.

13:05.168 --> 13:06.168
Seven o'clock.

13:09.334 --> 13:11.001
Not getting any easier, huh?

13:11.543 --> 13:12.584
No.

13:15.126 --> 13:16.376
I want back in.

13:17.543 --> 13:19.043
Desk job's killing me.

13:19.251 --> 13:20.250
Mike.

13:20.251 --> 13:22.500
Everybody knows you did the right thing
on that bridge.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.626
Hell, even the president knows.

13:25.293 --> 13:29.251
He just doesn't want to see you
and have to be reminded of it every day.

13:30.251 --> 13:33.043
He never even stopped
to grieve properly.

13:34.293 --> 13:36.709
Just, give it some time.

13:38.959 --> 13:40.042
How's Connor?

13:40.043 --> 13:42.667
President's son, misses his mom.

13:42.668 --> 13:44.208
Hell of a gig.

13:44.209 --> 13:45.958
Misses his buddy though.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.251
Yeah, he's a good kid.

13:47.876 --> 13:49.125
Is he still sneaking
around the White House,

13:49.126 --> 13:50.417
making everybody crazy?

13:50.418 --> 13:52.001
Oh, I wonder who taught him that.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.708
You know, the first time you walked
into my office out of the darkness...

13:58.709 --> 14:01.083
you needed therapy then.
Never mind now.

14:01.084 --> 14:04.667
And you don't exactly
do yourself any favors.

14:04.668 --> 14:05.917
Where are you going with this?

14:05.918 --> 14:09.958
Mike. Look, you gotta learn
how to get back into the real world.

14:09.959 --> 14:12.084
That's good, Jacobs.
Let me write that one down.

14:18.001 --> 14:19.126
Hey, Jacobs.

14:21.543 --> 14:22.792
Thanks.

14:22.793 --> 14:24.126
I'll be in touch.

14:58.793 --> 15:01.168
Hey, buddy. What do you think of this?

15:04.293 --> 15:06.459
- Which one do you like?
- I don't know.

15:08.543 --> 15:11.293
Okay, you take that one.
I'll take this one.

15:35.751 --> 15:38.333
- Maggie! Maggie!
- I'll take care of her! Sir!

15:38.334 --> 15:39.793
No! No, Mike!

15:55.834 --> 15:58.876
Mr. Foss came in. Chest pains.
About an hour ago.

16:04.501 --> 16:05.625
Hey, it's Leah.

16:05.626 --> 16:07.834
You've reached my phone.
You know what to do.

16:08.376 --> 16:09.668
Just checking in.

16:14.501 --> 16:17.709
Listen, I'll call you later. Bye.

16:20.751 --> 16:22.418
Get some fishing in.

16:22.918 --> 16:26.167
Hit the bag together. Be fun.

16:26.168 --> 16:27.917
I hate Camp David.

16:27.918 --> 16:31.542
Do we really have to go?
Can't we go somewhere else?

16:31.543 --> 16:33.709
You know, the beach?

16:35.376 --> 16:36.334
Yeah.

16:37.751 --> 16:39.501
The beach does kinda sound better.

16:47.418 --> 16:48.334
Hey.

16:48.751 --> 16:50.375
I've got three minutes.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.208
Let's run down to the kitchen
and get some ice cream.

16:52.209 --> 16:53.375
Yeah.

16:53.376 --> 16:54.875
Chocolate chip or rocky road?

16:54.876 --> 16:56.792
I'm gonna have rocky road
before you eat it all,

16:56.793 --> 16:58.043
like you did the last time.

16:58.543 --> 17:01.126
- I don't remember it that way.
- Yeah, you did.

17:02.334 --> 17:03.376
Come in.

17:04.459 --> 17:06.209
Mr. President, we're ready for you.

17:06.834 --> 17:08.584
- Already?
- Yes, sir.

17:10.001 --> 17:11.209
Sorry, buddy.

17:11.542 --> 17:12.709
It's okay, Dad.

17:14.042 --> 17:15.084
All right.

17:16.376 --> 17:17.542
I'll see you soon.

17:50.334 --> 17:52.250
Minister Lee
is going to want you to issue

17:52.251 --> 17:54.417
a joint statement, Mr. President...

17:54.418 --> 17:57.000
threatening military action
to get the North Koreans...

17:57.001 --> 17:59.250
to stand down from the border

17:59.251 --> 18:01.708
and stop their missile tests.

18:01.709 --> 18:03.584
Which I think we should give them.

18:06.584 --> 18:07.625
Ruth?

18:07.626 --> 18:10.167
Provided that the
North Koreans are rational...

18:10.168 --> 18:11.959
which is dicey, at best.

18:13.209 --> 18:16.083
We bluff. They call it. Then what?

18:16.084 --> 18:17.793
Well, who says we'd be bluffing?

18:19.209 --> 18:21.334
Personally,
I like to try to avoid a war.

18:22.751 --> 18:23.793
Charlie?

18:24.543 --> 18:27.459
I think I agree with Ruth on this one,
Mr. President.

18:28.626 --> 18:30.833
Thank you for sitting in, Mr. Speaker.

18:30.834 --> 18:32.918
- Yes, sir.
- I won't hold you up any longer.

18:43.793 --> 18:45.793
- Hello, Mr. Speaker.
- Hello, Janie.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.583
What time is Minister Lee due to arrive?

18:48.584 --> 18:50.084
7:00 this evening.

20:07.501 --> 20:09.001
Our guests have arrived.

20:32.626 --> 20:33.875
Prime Minister Lee.

20:33.876 --> 20:35.625
I'm Special Agent-in-Charge Roma.

20:35.626 --> 20:37.208
I'd like to welcome you
to the White House, sir.

20:37.209 --> 20:37.833
Thank you.

20:37.834 --> 20:40.918
May I introduce my Head of Security
and Chief Aide, Mr. Park.

20:41.918 --> 20:44.626
My pleasure.
Prime Minister, after you, please.

20:50.126 --> 20:53.126
Agent Davis will be taking care
of your security team outside.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.876
Prime Minister, if you would follow
Agent O'Neil, please?

20:58.209 --> 20:59.126
Ma'am?

21:01.501 --> 21:03.208
Private sector looks good on you, Dave.

21:03.209 --> 21:04.750
Yeah, something to look forward to.

21:04.751 --> 21:06.708
Yeah. How've you been?

21:06.709 --> 21:08.542
I'll tell you.
I miss the Secret Service.

21:08.543 --> 21:09.959
Best years of my life.

21:10.459 --> 21:12.417
It misses you too, old man.

21:12.418 --> 21:13.876
I could still kick your ass.

21:14.668 --> 21:16.584
At what? Dominos?

21:17.543 --> 21:19.584
- It's good to see you, my friend.
- You, too.

21:33.001 --> 21:33.917
Unidentified flight,

21:33.918 --> 21:37.208
this is Flight Leader, U.S. Air
Force aircraft at your starboard wing.

21:37.209 --> 21:38.918
You've entered restricted airspace.

21:39.334 --> 21:40.417
Unidentified flight,

21:40.418 --> 21:43.917
you must divert immediately
to vector 0-2-0. Acknowledge.

21:43.918 --> 21:46.208
I'm sorry to have
disrupted your vacation.

21:46.209 --> 21:47.668
Please. I'm glad you could come.

21:48.209 --> 21:50.334
Mr. Lee, we have a mutual problem.

21:50.668 --> 21:54.125
And I think together,
I'm confident we can find a solution.

21:54.126 --> 21:57.001
Thank you, Mr. President.
That's why I'm here.

21:57.543 --> 22:00.458
As you know, North Korea
has a one million man standing army...

22:00.459 --> 22:02.668
less than 50 kilometers
from our capital.

22:03.043 --> 22:04.251
The threat is real.

22:06.626 --> 22:07.583
Unidentified flight.

22:07.584 --> 22:10.167
You must divert immediately
to vector 0-2-0.

22:10.168 --> 22:13.418
This is your final warning.
You will be shot down. Acknowledge.

22:21.293 --> 22:23.334
Anti-aircraft. We're taking fire.

22:37.126 --> 22:39.125
Mr. Lee, I'm sure you can appreciate
that this is...

22:39.126 --> 22:40.792
Sir? There's been an incursion.
Please stand up.

22:40.793 --> 22:41.751
Let's go. Move!

22:42.584 --> 22:44.917
- Mr. Lee, please join us.
- That's not protocol, sir.

22:44.918 --> 22:45.708
He's coming with us!

22:45.709 --> 22:47.668
Move, move, move!
Get him to the elevator.

22:49.334 --> 22:51.168
- Go! Go!
- Find Connor!

22:51.543 --> 22:53.292
Code 9-9-9.

22:53.293 --> 22:54.584
Go. go, go! Move!

22:55.918 --> 22:57.479
Keep moving!
Get that elevator open now!

23:04.334 --> 23:06.000
Give me four minutes, Mr. President.

23:06.001 --> 23:07.376
Harden down on Olympus.

23:11.751 --> 23:13.293
Air support on the way.

23:16.001 --> 23:17.792
ETA, four minutes.

23:17.793 --> 23:21.001
Code Red. Air space 1 and 2 compromised.

23:21.584 --> 23:23.250
Robert, Delta, Ready One.

23:23.251 --> 23:26.209
Move to West Corridor!
Move to West Corridor!

23:41.959 --> 23:43.167
This way, please.

23:43.168 --> 23:45.751
This is not a drill.
Evacuate immediately.

24:13.793 --> 24:16.250
All units, 9-9-9.

24:16.251 --> 24:19.876
I repeat, all units, 9-9-9.

25:05.376 --> 25:06.334
Let's move!

25:12.459 --> 25:13.418
Find my son.

25:13.876 --> 25:15.208
Sylvio, find Sparkplug immediately.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.459
You okay, Mr. President?

25:17.793 --> 25:19.334
Sir. This way. Over here.

25:24.834 --> 25:26.709
Go on! Get down!

25:29.543 --> 25:30.251
Get down!

25:40.626 --> 25:42.334
Stay down! Don't move!

25:45.793 --> 25:49.001
Get down! Get out of the way!
Take cover!

26:18.126 --> 26:21.543
PPD Command, this is Wolfhound 6.
Have bogey in sight.

26:22.043 --> 26:24.751
Wolfhound 6, fire at will.
Repeat, fire at will.

26:25.168 --> 26:26.251
Acknowledge.

27:25.959 --> 27:26.918
Mr. President?

27:28.751 --> 27:31.001
We have confirmation
that the bogey is down, sir.

27:31.376 --> 27:32.584
Thank you, Jones.

27:35.084 --> 27:36.792
Activate Compound One.

27:36.793 --> 27:40.251
I want open lines to the Pentagon,
Homeland Security and NSA.

27:41.209 --> 27:44.250
Charlie.
Coordinate with the Air Force and FAA.

27:44.251 --> 27:46.750
- Find out if that's' a lone aircraft.
- Yes, sir.

27:46.751 --> 27:48.043
Half hour at the most.

27:49.709 --> 27:51.834
Ruth. Where the hell is my son?

28:33.126 --> 28:34.001
Hey!

28:35.959 --> 28:37.417
Hey!

28:37.418 --> 28:39.209
Hey, get the fuck down!

29:40.334 --> 29:42.875
Mr. Lee. We've had a problem.

29:42.876 --> 29:44.708
- Please have patience with us.
- Got it.

29:44.709 --> 29:46.459
- Mr. President.
- Yes?

29:48.584 --> 29:49.959
It's a critical message.

29:52.459 --> 29:54.251
The White House is under ground attack.

30:21.918 --> 30:22.625
Officer on deck!

30:22.626 --> 30:25.458
Rapid Response Team from Andrews,
get 'em moving!

30:25.459 --> 30:27.667
At ease. How bad is it?

30:27.668 --> 30:29.167
Front fence has been breached.

30:29.168 --> 30:31.167
We've got a C-130 burning
on the South Lawn

30:31.168 --> 30:33.000
and a gunfight raging on the North.

30:33.001 --> 30:34.875
Fucking shitting me.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.208
Where's the president?

30:36.209 --> 30:37.084
In the bunker.

31:12.084 --> 31:14.375
- Get me the Pentagon on the line now!
- Yes, sir!

31:14.376 --> 31:15.376
It's happening.

31:22.626 --> 31:23.626
Mr. President!

31:33.709 --> 31:35.001
Forbes, what are you doing?

31:36.709 --> 31:39.043
- Move!
- For God's sakes, Forbes.

31:46.293 --> 31:47.876
Forbes! What are you doing?

31:48.334 --> 31:49.084
Shut up!

32:48.959 --> 32:50.083
Come on. Tim.

32:50.084 --> 32:51.875
Come on. Hang in there!

32:51.876 --> 32:52.751
Hey!

32:54.126 --> 32:55.126
Ah, shit.

33:00.501 --> 33:01.750
Where's the president?

33:01.751 --> 33:02.918
I don't know!

33:04.084 --> 33:06.250
Goddamn it! Where's that response team?

33:06.251 --> 33:08.708
- They're 5 minutes out, sir, but...
- But what?

33:08.709 --> 33:11.125
We have a hostage situation
on our hands.

33:11.126 --> 33:12.834
P.E.O.C.'s gone offline.

33:35.501 --> 33:40.668
Go back! Get back now! Go back!

34:20.333 --> 34:21.458
Fuck!

34:24.583 --> 34:25.958
RPG!

34:35.793 --> 34:38.418
Get in! Get inside! Get inside!

34:50.293 --> 34:52.251
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

36:07.626 --> 36:09.209
Go, go! Move!

36:11.459 --> 36:13.208
Fall back, fall back!

36:13.209 --> 36:14.543
Let's go, let's go!

36:22.334 --> 36:24.667
- They're down the hall!
- Shit, we've only got four guys left!

36:24.668 --> 36:26.334
Hold your positions, you understand?

36:31.084 --> 36:32.918
I got this door. Cover the other one.

36:55.709 --> 36:58.583
Olympus has fallen. Olympus has fallen.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.126
Olympus has fallen.

37:02.001 --> 37:02.959
Fuck you!

37:08.376 --> 37:09.959
They've taken the White House.

37:38.126 --> 37:40.084
Command, Sniper Team One, in position.

38:02.376 --> 38:04.917
We're coming from the White House.
So far, the perimeter's been set.

38:04.918 --> 38:07.583
We're waiting on more intel to come
in right now, and once we do...

38:07.584 --> 38:09.250
Bravo team's gonna breach.

38:09.251 --> 38:11.876
- Wait for my command to execute.
- Yes, sir.

38:14.001 --> 38:17.875
Not since the British burned down
the White House in the War of 1812...

38:17.876 --> 38:21.083
has an enemy force occupied
the center of American power.

38:21.084 --> 38:21.917
The White House,

38:21.918 --> 38:25.584
the most protected building on Earth,
has fallen.

38:26.084 --> 38:28.418
Sir,
we have a hot feed from the P.E.O.C.

38:30.459 --> 38:33.375
Mr. Lee. Sir, are you safe?

38:33.376 --> 38:35.083
Are you with the president?

38:35.084 --> 38:36.751
Sir, can you hear m...?

38:37.793 --> 38:38.876
Oh, my God.

38:43.876 --> 38:45.293
Don't negotiate.

38:50.543 --> 38:51.751
Sir?

38:52.084 --> 38:54.251
I have your commander-in-chief.

38:55.918 --> 38:57.418
Now, stand down.

38:58.001 --> 38:59.208
Who are you?

38:59.209 --> 39:01.959
I am the man in control
of your White House.

39:04.084 --> 39:07.043
Now, stand your men down.

39:14.209 --> 39:15.542
- Stand down!
- Sir.

39:15.543 --> 39:17.376
All units, stand down!

39:18.168 --> 39:21.417
Ladies and gentlemen we are at DEFCON 4.

39:21.418 --> 39:22.709
How could you?

39:23.668 --> 39:25.918
- Put your hands up. -Fuck you.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.376
No!

39:49.459 --> 39:51.459
There is a reason I never voted for you.

39:53.709 --> 39:55.084
Don't do it, Forbes!

41:49.001 --> 41:50.708
It takes 15 minutes
for your Armed Forces

41:50.709 --> 41:52.251
to reach the White House.

41:54.793 --> 41:56.584
We took it down in 13.

43:34.084 --> 43:35.125
Hurry, we need a wheelchair.

43:35.126 --> 43:37.708
In Triage, do you want me
to color code them or number code them?

43:37.709 --> 43:38.625
Color code 'em.

43:38.626 --> 43:40.709
Okay, Pam,
we still need to take the vitals.

43:51.001 --> 43:53.459
Call, Mike. Mike.

43:56.918 --> 43:59.292
The cellular service in the area
you are calling

43:59.293 --> 44:00.250
has been suspended temporarily.

44:00.251 --> 44:02.834
I got head trauma,
six-year-old girl, she's fading!

44:20.709 --> 44:22.293
Bring Mr. Asher here.

44:24.501 --> 44:26.584
What are you doing, for Christ's sake?

44:29.293 --> 44:30.418
Oh, sir!

44:33.584 --> 44:36.418
I have no interest
in your nuclear launch codes.

44:38.834 --> 44:41.584
By now your Pentagon
has changed then, no?

44:42.834 --> 44:44.168
Sit.

44:44.918 --> 44:46.334
You from the North?

44:46.959 --> 44:48.918
You sure as hell are not from the South.

44:49.501 --> 44:51.334
I'm working for justice.

44:51.626 --> 44:54.167
To give millions of starving
men, women and children

44:54.168 --> 44:56.667
a chance at more than just subsistence.

44:56.668 --> 45:00.418
To end the civil war your country
interrupted so long ago.

45:01.168 --> 45:02.459
And yes...

45:04.376 --> 45:06.792
for a united, prosperous Korea.

45:06.793 --> 45:08.709
It's a whole new world, baby.

45:09.293 --> 45:11.668
What's the going rate for souls
these days?

45:12.459 --> 45:13.667
What'd you say to me?

45:13.668 --> 45:15.417
I never would have taken you
for a traitor.

45:15.418 --> 45:16.376
Me?

45:17.001 --> 45:18.583
What about you?

45:18.584 --> 45:21.709
You sold this country out long
before I ever did.

45:22.084 --> 45:25.875
Globalization and fucking Wall Street.

45:25.876 --> 45:28.918
What's it cost to buy
a presidency nowadays anyway?

45:29.459 --> 45:32.417
$500 million?

45:32.418 --> 45:36.334
I'm a fucking rookie compared to you!

45:37.626 --> 45:39.459
Gotta keep your gloves up, Forbes.

45:40.584 --> 45:41.459
Enough!

45:46.126 --> 45:47.668
What about Connor?

45:48.126 --> 45:50.001
What the fuck are you gonna do
with my son?

46:02.668 --> 46:03.751
Mr. Speaker.

46:05.001 --> 46:06.917
As both the President
and the Vice President

46:06.918 --> 46:09.000
of the United States
are unable to discharge

46:09.001 --> 46:10.458
the duties of their offices

46:10.459 --> 46:14.251
I'm officially placing you
under Secret Service protection.

46:18.668 --> 46:21.584
You are the Acting President
of the United States.

46:23.668 --> 46:24.918
Are they alive?

46:25.418 --> 46:26.543
They are.

46:37.834 --> 46:41.750
Sir, North Korea is denying
any involvement in the attack.

46:41.751 --> 46:44.333
We've secured the perimeter
of the White House...

46:44.334 --> 46:46.208
and cleared a 10-block radius.

46:46.209 --> 46:50.043
Sir, they've also assassinated
the South Korean Prime Minister.

47:57.876 --> 48:00.500
We have contact
from inside the White House.

48:00.501 --> 48:02.918
Trace confirms
it's the president's Sat phone.

48:03.251 --> 48:04.209
Put it through!

48:05.376 --> 48:06.751
Mr. President?

48:07.084 --> 48:08.500
Negative.

48:08.501 --> 48:11.000
- Identify yourself.
- Echelon Four.

48:11.001 --> 48:12.000
That's one of yours?

48:12.001 --> 48:16.333
- Designator?
- Oscar Zulu 309.

48:16.334 --> 48:19.042
Jesus. Banning? Where are you?

48:19.043 --> 48:20.625
I'm in the Oval Office.

48:20.626 --> 48:22.292
Is the president in the bunker?

48:22.293 --> 48:24.876
- He...
- Can we trust him?

48:25.751 --> 48:27.875
Banning was one of our best agents.

48:27.876 --> 48:30.333
Mr. Speaker, I just have to say,
this is Mike Banning.

48:30.334 --> 48:32.792
This is the same guy that was removed
from the president's detail...

48:32.793 --> 48:33.708
- after the accident
- Whoa, whoa,

48:33.709 --> 48:34.958
- when we lost the first lady?
- Ray! Ray! Ray!

48:34.959 --> 48:35.958
- You wanna add something?
- Well, what's he doing

48:35.959 --> 48:36.750
- I suggest you get your facts straight.
- In the White House right now?

48:36.751 --> 48:38.292
- How do we know we can trust this guy?

48:38.293 --> 48:41.083
Banning is ex-Special Forces,
Ranger Battalion

48:41.084 --> 48:45.126
He will move mountains or die trying.
I know him.

48:45.584 --> 48:46.792
Does anyone else in this room

48:46.793 --> 48:49.501
have any intelligence
coming out of the White House?

48:51.418 --> 48:52.918
Then we have no choice.

48:54.751 --> 48:58.543
Yes. The president's in the bunker.
He's being held hostage.

49:00.126 --> 49:01.333
What do they want?

49:01.334 --> 49:02.751
We're trying to find out.

49:03.168 --> 49:04.500
Who's in charge?

49:04.501 --> 49:05.458
Trumbull.

49:05.459 --> 49:08.001
- Are there any survivors with you?
- Negative, sir.

49:08.751 --> 49:10.084
They wiped us out.

49:12.168 --> 49:14.458
They have commandos roaming
the hallways...

49:14.459 --> 49:16.793
with enough explosives
to take out an army.

49:17.168 --> 49:20.833
Looks like the doors and windows
are rigged with C-4 explosives.

49:20.834 --> 49:23.084
Who knows what other tricks
they have up their sleeves?

49:23.626 --> 49:26.793
Any team coming in is gonna be ringing
the front doorbell pretty loud.

49:27.418 --> 49:28.625
They shut the power down.

49:28.626 --> 49:31.084
Lights off.
And I assume they closed the air vents.

49:31.501 --> 49:32.458
I killed the surveillance,

49:32.459 --> 49:34.625
but I don't know
how long that's gonna last.

49:34.626 --> 49:35.668
Where's Connor?

49:36.209 --> 49:40.333
Oh, we have no status of his location,
but he's presumed to still be inside.

49:40.334 --> 49:42.083
Well, they're looking for him.

49:42.084 --> 49:43.418
They have his photo.

49:44.043 --> 49:45.168
Sir...

49:45.876 --> 49:47.583
I'm here. Use me.

49:47.584 --> 49:50.626
Okay, Banning. Sit tight.
We'll get back with you.

50:48.293 --> 50:50.459
Sir, we have a hot feed
from the P.E.O.C.

50:51.126 --> 50:53.667
- Mr. Speaker.
- What is it you want?

50:53.668 --> 50:56.583
Recall the Seventh Fleet
from the Sea of Japan.

50:56.584 --> 51:01.542
And withdraw all 28,500 American troops
from the Demilitarized Zone.

51:01.543 --> 51:03.209
If you do not comply.

51:03.751 --> 51:07.042
If you attempt any operation
to take this building...

51:07.043 --> 51:10.042
- if you deviate from my instructions...
- Wait a minute.

51:10.043 --> 51:12.292
We can't just recall the Seventh Fleet.

51:12.293 --> 51:14.834
Then I will execute your officials
one by one...

51:15.251 --> 51:17.333
and their blood will be on your hands.

51:17.334 --> 51:18.626
You have until dawn.

51:18.959 --> 51:20.876
I suggest you move quickly.

51:22.793 --> 51:23.625
Who is that guy?

51:23.626 --> 51:26.292
Well, sir, we're running facial
recognition on him right now.

51:26.293 --> 51:29.042
Well, he cleared as part of
the South Korean security detail.

51:29.043 --> 51:32.667
If we recall the Fleet,
and leave the DMZ...

51:32.668 --> 51:36.167
Seoul, all of South Korea could fall
within 72 hours, sir.

51:36.168 --> 51:39.250
But if we do nothing, they kill Asher,
the vice president...

51:39.251 --> 51:41.208
and his entire National Security team.

51:41.209 --> 51:43.334
And Connor, if he's in there.

51:58.918 --> 52:00.625
Mary, get me some coffee

52:00.626 --> 52:04.458
Half-and-half, three Sweet 'N Lows.
In a real cup.

52:04.459 --> 52:06.709
Not one of those paper
or Styrofoam things.

52:09.209 --> 52:13.167
All right.
Let's secure all nuclear sites.

52:13.168 --> 52:15.500
Get me our expert on North Korea.

52:15.501 --> 52:18.833
Then I want to speak with the Premiere
of North Korea on a secure line.

52:18.834 --> 52:20.667
After that,
I wanna speak with the Russians,

52:20.668 --> 52:22.625
the Chinese,
the British and the French.

52:22.626 --> 52:24.918
And set up a press conference.
In that order.

52:28.834 --> 52:32.043
The United States of America
doesn't negotiate with terrorists.

52:38.584 --> 52:41.293
Who said anything about negotiating?

53:09.168 --> 53:13.293
Admiral Hoenig, your Cerberus code.

53:19.959 --> 53:21.959
You kill him, you won't get the code.

53:23.209 --> 53:25.168
I will not ask again.

53:45.293 --> 53:48.001
- Give it to him, Joe.
- Mr. President.

53:48.459 --> 53:49.959
You'll never get mine.

53:50.751 --> 53:55.959
Tango-Juliet-1-9-3-3-4.

53:57.876 --> 53:59.083
Louden

53:59.084 --> 54:04.084
Tango-Juliet-1-9-3-3-4.

54:16.168 --> 54:17.418
What the hell?

54:18.584 --> 54:20.208
Get me Homeland Security.

54:20.209 --> 54:21.168
No, now!

54:25.043 --> 54:29.376
Sir. NORAD reports a Cerberus code
has been entered.

54:30.293 --> 54:31.626
Jesus.

54:38.834 --> 54:42.918
Jacobs, I got something coming your way.

54:43.584 --> 54:45.501
I got a clean commando in front of me.

54:47.168 --> 54:48.875
- What is that? -Is he alive?

54:48.876 --> 54:50.418
Ask me a serious question.

54:51.209 --> 54:52.668
Anybody around the table?

54:53.876 --> 54:55.292
We don't recognize it.

54:55.293 --> 54:58.209
Well, whoever they are,
they're fucking good.

54:59.001 --> 55:01.458
They're well-trained
and they're well-organized.

55:01.459 --> 55:02.625
But I guess you know that already.

55:02.626 --> 55:03.918
Get that over to Langley.

55:04.751 --> 55:06.833
So, what have you got? Talk to me.

55:06.834 --> 55:09.918
They want us to recall the Seventh Fleet
and pull our troops out.

55:11.001 --> 55:12.126
Oh, is that all?

55:13.459 --> 55:15.834
A Cerberus code has been entered.

55:16.543 --> 55:17.958
What's Cerberus?

55:17.959 --> 55:19.292
That's classified.

55:19.293 --> 55:20.959
Classified? Really?

55:21.418 --> 55:24.626
Well, right now I think I have
the proverbial need-to-fucking-know.

55:29.418 --> 55:32.626
Cerberus is a
highly-classified military protocol.

55:33.001 --> 55:39.167
A 3-pronged fail-safe in the case of
an inadvertent nuclear launch.

55:39.168 --> 55:42.625
It allows us to access
the self-destruct mechanism

55:42.626 --> 55:45.083
in our ICBM's in-flight.

55:45.084 --> 55:48.208
So even if one of our nuclear warheads
was launched and we wanted to abort.

55:48.209 --> 55:51.333
Cerberus is the only way to stop it
from reaching its target.

55:51.334 --> 55:53.668
No one person has all three codes.

55:54.126 --> 55:57.333
It's parceled out to the president,
Secretary of Defense...

55:57.334 --> 55:59.333
and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

55:59.334 --> 56:02.083
All of whom are
in the president's bunker right now.

56:02.084 --> 56:05.875
With those codes, they can destroy
any long-range nuke that we fire.

56:05.876 --> 56:09.751
And that would make America vulnerable
to a nuclear strike.

56:11.418 --> 56:13.000
So, change the codes.

56:13.001 --> 56:14.083
We can't.

56:14.084 --> 56:16.042
Cerberus was designed
as a self-contained

56:16.043 --> 56:17.500
total-isolation system.

56:17.501 --> 56:20.542
The only way to change the codes
is physically on the computer itself.

56:20.543 --> 56:22.792
Which is located
in the president's bunker.

56:22.793 --> 56:25.333
So, now we know why
they wanted the president's son.

56:25.334 --> 56:27.917
The president will hold out
as long as he can.

56:27.918 --> 56:29.543
But if they get his son...

56:30.293 --> 56:31.584
if they hurt him...

56:32.084 --> 56:33.083
well...

56:33.084 --> 56:35.834
nobody could hold out
under those circumstances.

56:36.418 --> 56:37.834
So, find Connor

56:38.293 --> 56:39.918
get him the hell out of there.

56:40.584 --> 56:41.584
Yes, sir.

56:49.668 --> 56:51.084
Mr. Forbes.

56:57.959 --> 56:59.168
Who is that?

57:05.959 --> 57:07.376
Mike Banning.

57:16.751 --> 57:18.458
And who might that be?

57:18.459 --> 57:21.793
He was on the president's protection
detail for a few years.

57:22.501 --> 57:24.250
Are we worried about him?

57:24.251 --> 57:25.376
Hell no.

57:28.626 --> 57:29.751
No.

57:31.251 --> 57:32.543
He should be.

59:37.126 --> 59:42.584
Did Truman gut the White House interior
in 1948 or '49?

59:43.334 --> 59:45.251
I believe it was '49.

59:46.334 --> 59:49.876
Steel frame over
the old stone walls. Yes?

01:00:08.334 --> 01:00:09.376
Connor!

01:00:15.793 --> 01:00:18.084
- How're you doing? Okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:00:24.168 --> 01:00:26.709
I see this is still
your favorite hiding place, huh?

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.458
I've got Sparkplug.

01:00:31.459 --> 01:00:33.251
Finally, some good news.

01:00:34.001 --> 01:00:36.543
He's safe. I'm bringing him out.

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:39.750
What about my dad?

01:00:39.751 --> 01:00:42.375
Your dad's gonna be fine, okay?

01:00:42.376 --> 01:00:43.500
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

01:00:43.501 --> 01:00:44.959
We're gonna get him outta here.

01:01:37.584 --> 01:01:39.126
- Okay? -Yeah.

01:01:39.584 --> 01:01:41.418
All right. Let's get outta here.

01:01:43.376 --> 01:01:45.667
- You ready to haul ass?
- Yeah.

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:46.959
Okay, stay close.

01:01:50.084 --> 01:01:50.876
Okay.

01:02:06.959 --> 01:02:08.001
Come on.

01:02:13.626 --> 01:02:14.584
Okay, come on.

01:02:20.751 --> 01:02:21.958
All right, kiddo.

01:02:21.959 --> 01:02:24.458
Keep an eye out, okay? Watch my six.

01:02:24.459 --> 01:02:25.334
Jacobs.

01:02:26.001 --> 01:02:27.543
Okay, I have Sparkplug.

01:02:28.543 --> 01:02:32.500
He's coming out in a ventilation shaft
in the northwest corner, ground floor.

01:02:32.501 --> 01:02:33.792
Have the green party waiting.

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:34.709
We'll be there.

01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:58.876
How are you gonna fit through that?
You're coming with me, right?

01:03:02.334 --> 01:03:03.709
I gotta go get your dad.

01:03:04.084 --> 01:03:06.375
All right. Now, listen, you can do this.

01:03:06.376 --> 01:03:09.167
Now, you remember chimney climbing
I taught you on the Rose Garden wall?

01:03:09.168 --> 01:03:12.000
Yeah? So, that's all it is. Okay?

01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:15.083
It's one foot against the front wall,
one foot against the back.

01:03:15.084 --> 01:03:16.584
Now, all the way to the top.

01:03:21.876 --> 01:03:23.667
- Mike?
- Yeah.

01:03:23.668 --> 01:03:24.834
I'm scared.

01:03:25.251 --> 01:03:26.626
Yeah, me too.

01:03:27.459 --> 01:03:29.001
But you're gonna get through it.

01:03:30.126 --> 01:03:31.584
You're one of us now.

01:03:32.209 --> 01:03:34.583
This is yours. Put that on.

01:03:34.584 --> 01:03:36.459
Now, I'm counting on you, kiddo.

01:03:37.001 --> 01:03:38.000
Okay.

01:03:38.001 --> 01:03:40.376
Good man. All right. Let's go.

01:03:44.584 --> 01:03:46.834
There you go, kiddo.
I'm gonna push you on up, okay?

01:03:50.084 --> 01:03:51.668
I'll see you on the other side.

01:03:55.376 --> 01:03:56.583
Now, keep movin'.

01:03:56.584 --> 01:03:58.334
Sparkplug is on his way up.

01:04:00.543 --> 01:04:03.751
Oh, Jacobs, hold on. Connor, wait up.

01:05:11.043 --> 01:05:13.209
- False alarm. Go.
- Okay.

01:05:15.834 --> 01:05:17.334
He's coming out, Jacobs.

01:05:38.876 --> 01:05:41.334
Hold your position.
Hostiles in the area.

01:05:51.459 --> 01:05:53.418
Go, go, go! It's clear.

01:05:54.376 --> 01:05:56.126
CIB-1. Going in.

01:06:13.209 --> 01:06:14.209
You Okay?

01:06:19.626 --> 01:06:20.626
Coming out.

01:06:26.918 --> 01:06:29.626
Hostile moving toward the ledge.
Hustle up.

01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:44.834
Sparkplug received.

01:06:47.334 --> 01:06:48.793
Good job, Banning.

01:06:49.459 --> 01:06:51.959
Now, let's see
if we can get the president out.

01:06:52.793 --> 01:06:54.043
Roger that.

01:06:57.459 --> 01:07:04.042
I want to reassure all Americans
and everyone around the world

01:07:04.043 --> 01:07:05.958
that despite today's events

01:07:05.959 --> 01:07:08.959
our government remains 100% functional.

01:07:09.709 --> 01:07:12.501
We know that the president is alive.

01:07:13.543 --> 01:07:18.251
To our friends, we are grateful
for your loyalty and support.

01:07:19.126 --> 01:07:22.084
As a nation,
we are never stronger than when tested.

01:07:22.543 --> 01:07:25.668
We will remain united and strong.

01:07:26.293 --> 01:07:28.417
God bless you all

01:07:28.418 --> 01:07:31.001
and God bless
these United States of America.

01:07:50.543 --> 01:07:54.918
Okay, asshole.
Yo. Hey. Who's running the show?

01:07:57.251 --> 01:07:58.709
Oh, you speak English?

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:01.209
They teach you that where you come from?

01:08:01.918 --> 01:08:03.833
'Cause you know what they teach me?

01:08:03.834 --> 01:08:06.709
Is how to extract information
from people like you.

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:16.917
That's funny, huh?

01:08:16.917 --> 01:08:18.751
No, it's funny. I know. I get it.

01:08:32.917 --> 01:08:36.084
Yeah. I guess I'm a little rusty.

01:08:38.084 --> 01:08:39.875
I liked your friend though.

01:08:39.876 --> 01:08:41.417
He seems like a funny guy.

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:44.334
What's your leader's name?

01:08:44.876 --> 01:08:46.501
Oh, I'm sorry. Here.

01:08:47.751 --> 01:08:49.001
How many men do you have?

01:08:53.167 --> 01:08:54.626
In English.

01:08:55.876 --> 01:08:57.792
His name is Yeonsak Kang.

01:08:57.792 --> 01:08:59.042
He's the head of the KUF.

01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:01.000
The paramilitary organization?

01:09:01.001 --> 01:09:02.459
No surprises there.

01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:05.582
40 commandos breached the gate
and 28 are left.

01:09:05.584 --> 01:09:07.667
How do we know
we can trust the information?

01:09:08.126 --> 01:09:09.959
I just asked them nicely.

01:09:11.501 --> 01:09:12.792
Kang Yeonsak?

01:09:12.792 --> 01:09:15.667
Sir, this is one of the most
wanted terrorists in the world.

01:09:15.667 --> 01:09:18.875
He was brought across the DMZ as a child
after his father was executed

01:09:18.876 --> 01:09:21.207
for crimes against
the North Korean state.

01:09:21.209 --> 01:09:22.250
While they were crossing the border,

01:09:22.251 --> 01:09:24.417
his mother was killed
by an American landmine.

01:09:24.417 --> 01:09:28.207
This guy masterminded the 2004 bombing
of the British Embassy in Seoul.

01:09:28.209 --> 01:09:31.917
And he funneled Pyongyang uranium
enrichment technology from Pakistan.

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:33.875
He's never before been
photographed or identified

01:09:33.876 --> 01:09:36.207
by any Western intelligence agency.

01:09:36.209 --> 01:09:38.292
Well, Jesus Christ,
nobody ever thought to look for him

01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:39.417
inside the South Korean government.

01:09:39.417 --> 01:09:42.207
Look, I don't care who he is.
With a force that size

01:09:42.209 --> 01:09:44.542
I have men who can sweep 'em out
in short order.

01:09:44.542 --> 01:09:46.834
Sir, this is not going to be a cakewalk.

01:09:47.292 --> 01:09:49.707
These sons of bitches
are pretty fucking tough.

01:09:49.709 --> 01:09:52.250
I've got the toughest fuckin' guys
in the world.

01:09:52.251 --> 01:09:54.375
What we need to know is
how to get into that bunker.

01:09:54.376 --> 01:09:57.583
Once those blast doors close, you don't.
It's nuclear hardened.

01:09:57.584 --> 01:10:00.875
Now, there used to be some old tunnels,
but they were sealed up years ago.

01:10:00.876 --> 01:10:03.583
Sir, your men need to know
what the hell they're dropping into.

01:10:03.584 --> 01:10:06.751
Do not launch anything
until I do some recon.

01:10:40.376 --> 01:10:45.043
Agent Banning. Yes, I know who you are.

01:10:47.376 --> 01:10:49.126
Welcome to my house.

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:56.792
Hey, asshole. What took you so long?

01:10:56.793 --> 01:10:59.126
You're the one that
let the first lady die, no?

01:11:00.793 --> 01:11:02.584
And soon, the president.

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:05.458
Failure seems to be a habit with you.

01:11:05.459 --> 01:11:06.918
Yeah, well...

01:11:07.709 --> 01:11:11.208
Maybe I owe you for giving me the chance
for making up for that today.

01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:14.667
I admire you
for acknowledging your failure.

01:11:14.668 --> 01:11:16.292
But there's no going back.

01:11:16.293 --> 01:11:19.792
Nothing you try and do here
tonight can atone.

01:11:19.793 --> 01:11:21.209
Yeah, maybe not.

01:11:21.918 --> 01:11:25.208
But I reckon fucking your shit up
will be a pretty good start.

01:11:25.209 --> 01:11:30.209
You may wanna take a headcount.
The bodies are piling up.

01:11:32.459 --> 01:11:34.833
I have more than enough men
to finish the mission.

01:11:34.834 --> 01:11:37.792
Oh, and by the way,
if you're looking for Connor...

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.876
he's on his way to the baseball game.

01:11:42.418 --> 01:11:44.251
How's your wife, Michael?

01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:47.834
Leah. She's a nurse.

01:11:48.293 --> 01:11:49.875
Saves lives.

01:11:49.876 --> 01:11:52.043
Too bad she will not save yours.

01:11:52.751 --> 01:11:54.417
You know what?

01:11:54.418 --> 01:11:57.001
Why don't you and I
play a game of fuck off?

01:11:57.501 --> 01:11:59.001
You go first.

01:12:00.959 --> 01:12:02.043
Go kill him.

01:12:14.584 --> 01:12:15.626
Enough!

01:12:17.293 --> 01:12:18.334
Enough!

01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:37.501
Madam Secretary.

01:12:39.376 --> 01:12:41.043
Your Cerberus code.

01:12:41.834 --> 01:12:43.084
No!

01:12:47.793 --> 01:12:48.751
Ruth!

01:12:53.626 --> 01:12:54.751
Your code!

01:12:55.834 --> 01:12:57.708
You'll have to kill me.

01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:59.168
As you wish.

01:13:08.168 --> 01:13:09.501
There's a saying...

01:13:10.543 --> 01:13:11.668
in Korea.

01:13:17.501 --> 01:13:19.417
Seeing something a 100 times...

01:13:19.418 --> 01:13:21.501
is not as good as living it once.

01:13:23.626 --> 01:13:24.959
Fuck you.

01:13:26.251 --> 01:13:27.293
Stop!

01:13:27.834 --> 01:13:29.333
Enough!

01:13:29.334 --> 01:13:30.918
Enough! Stop!

01:13:33.168 --> 01:13:34.126
Enough!

01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:46.418
Give it to him, Ruth.

01:13:47.001 --> 01:13:48.333
It doesn't matter.

01:13:48.334 --> 01:13:50.001
And he won't get mine.

01:13:55.501 --> 01:13:56.376
Ruth.

01:14:01.918 --> 01:14:03.126
Give it to him!

01:14:04.168 --> 01:14:05.834
That's an order, Ruth.

01:14:06.418 --> 01:14:07.501
Sir...

01:14:08.376 --> 01:14:09.918
Give it him, Ruth.

01:14:12.168 --> 01:14:13.584
Yes, sir.

01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:19.542
Echo-Mike...

01:14:19.543 --> 01:14:24.168
6-0-2-8...

01:14:25.459 --> 01:14:27.918
5, sir.

01:14:35.959 --> 01:14:39.959
Get your fucking hands off of me!

01:14:42.668 --> 01:14:46.668
Sir, NORAD reports that the second
Cerberus code has been entered.

01:14:52.418 --> 01:14:53.418
My God.

01:15:06.209 --> 01:15:09.375
- Mike! Mike, Mike, it's me.
- Dave?

01:15:09.376 --> 01:15:10.833
You scared the shit out of me.

01:15:10.834 --> 01:15:12.083
Jesus, what the fuck?

01:15:12.084 --> 01:15:12.875
Yeah, just put that thing down.

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:14.542
I almost blew your
fucking brains out, man.

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:15.750
What are you doing here?

01:15:15.751 --> 01:15:17.667
I was with the South Korean delegation.

01:15:17.668 --> 01:15:19.708
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:21.083
I thought you were working
at the Treasury.

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:22.250
Yeah, I am.

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:24.293
Believe it or not,
I came in through the front door.

01:15:25.751 --> 01:15:29.376
Oh, fuck, Mike.

01:15:29.793 --> 01:15:31.875
I saw my life flash in front of me.

01:15:31.876 --> 01:15:34.667
Look at my hand. Fucker's shakin'.

01:15:34.668 --> 01:15:36.000
Jesus Christ.

01:15:36.001 --> 01:15:37.375
It's good to see you, buddy.

01:15:37.376 --> 01:15:39.043
You got a funny way of showing it.

01:15:43.251 --> 01:15:44.500
Is the president okay?

01:15:44.501 --> 01:15:45.834
He's alive for now.

01:15:47.834 --> 01:15:49.376
They got him in the bunker.

01:15:50.834 --> 01:15:52.375
It's a fucking shit show, huh?

01:15:52.376 --> 01:15:53.668
Yeah, that's for sure.

01:15:56.001 --> 01:15:57.334
Roma make it?

01:15:59.626 --> 01:16:00.918
Fuck.

01:16:02.043 --> 01:16:03.376
We gotta keep movin'.

01:16:08.668 --> 01:16:10.583
- You got a plan, Mike?
- Yeah.

01:16:10.584 --> 01:16:12.334
But it hasn't worked out so far.

01:16:14.459 --> 01:16:16.708
Fuckin' Mike. You always were a hardass.

01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:18.209
You never change.

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:22.418
Hey, Dave.

01:16:23.168 --> 01:16:26.709
This place is getting me rattled, man.
I can't think straight.

01:16:27.501 --> 01:16:28.709
You okay?

01:16:29.584 --> 01:16:32.793
No. Not for real.

01:16:33.459 --> 01:16:35.709
This fucking Kang, man. He's crazy.

01:16:38.001 --> 01:16:39.418
How do you know his name?

01:16:45.876 --> 01:16:48.459
Hey, Mike, do you remember that time
in New York?

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:45.876
Dave.

01:17:48.126 --> 01:17:49.459
Why'd you do it?

01:17:50.751 --> 01:17:52.543
Fuck, Mike.

01:17:54.084 --> 01:17:55.251
Fuck.

01:17:57.793 --> 01:17:59.626
I lost my way.

01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:06.001
You can make up for it now.

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:10.709
Tell Kang I'm dead.

01:18:12.126 --> 01:18:14.043
You'll help me save the president.

01:18:18.418 --> 01:18:21.918
Kang. It's Forbes.

01:18:23.459 --> 01:18:27.918
I got him. All clear.

01:18:30.126 --> 01:18:31.126
Good.

01:18:44.959 --> 01:18:46.043
Ruth.

01:18:47.251 --> 01:18:49.834
Mr. President, sir?

01:18:53.168 --> 01:18:54.334
Rough day.

01:18:55.001 --> 01:18:56.459
Could be worse.

01:18:57.793 --> 01:18:59.543
How's my hair?

01:19:01.459 --> 01:19:03.418
Not a strand out of place.

01:19:11.293 --> 01:19:12.584
Any regrets?

01:19:12.876 --> 01:19:13.876
None.

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:16.834
You?

01:19:19.209 --> 01:19:20.418
A few.

01:19:20.876 --> 01:19:22.459
Like running for president.

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:27.209
The office is lucky to have you, sir.

01:19:28.334 --> 01:19:31.001
We all may meet our maker today...

01:19:33.043 --> 01:19:37.043
but the one thing
I do not want on my tombstone...

01:19:38.376 --> 01:19:40.751
"She Went Down Without a Fight."

01:19:46.501 --> 01:19:48.001
No danger of that.

01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:51.334
Pull up your satellite feed.

01:19:52.001 --> 01:19:53.293
Give me eyes on.

01:19:55.001 --> 01:19:57.793
Looks like there's only four sentries
on the roof.

01:19:58.251 --> 01:19:59.917
With the Air Defense grid gone,

01:19:59.918 --> 01:20:01.876
they're vulnerable
to an aerial insertion.

01:20:03.209 --> 01:20:05.459
Wait. Let me get there first
and check it out.

01:20:06.751 --> 01:20:08.125
We're not waiting.

01:20:08.126 --> 01:20:10.001
We have to secure Cerberus.

01:20:10.418 --> 01:20:11.793
Oh, fuck.

01:20:13.001 --> 01:20:14.834
Send in the SEALS, General.

01:20:15.501 --> 01:20:16.834
We're going through the roof.

01:20:25.543 --> 01:20:27.293
Command, Tiger Flight inbound.

01:20:29.834 --> 01:20:31.251
Tiger Team, stand by.

01:20:34.126 --> 01:20:35.875
The assault team is on the way.

01:20:35.876 --> 01:20:37.168
About fucking time.

01:20:38.293 --> 01:20:39.959
Yes, sir. Copy.

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:59.333
Command,
Tiger Flight's three minutes out.

01:20:59.334 --> 01:21:00.834
Team, go green.

01:21:01.334 --> 01:21:02.251
Go green.

01:21:08.376 --> 01:21:09.001
Cho.

01:21:44.918 --> 01:21:48.084
60 seconds to target.
I want a clean deployment.

01:22:11.084 --> 01:22:11.834
Fuck.

01:22:12.584 --> 01:22:13.626
Tell them to hold.

01:22:14.168 --> 01:22:15.876
We aren't holding shit!

01:22:17.001 --> 01:22:20.083
Jacobs. You've gotta abort his mission.

01:22:20.084 --> 01:22:21.875
They've got the Hydra Six!

01:22:21.876 --> 01:22:22.792
What's that?

01:22:22.793 --> 01:22:25.042
Next generation weaponry. Ours.

01:22:25.043 --> 01:22:27.208
How the hell would they get that?

01:22:27.209 --> 01:22:29.293
It doesn't matter. We'll take it out.

01:22:29.918 --> 01:22:31.876
I said abort this fucking mission!

01:22:32.418 --> 01:22:34.333
Let's go get our goddamn house back,
Captain.

01:22:34.334 --> 01:22:36.667
Tiger Two, Tiger Three,
you're cleared hot.

01:22:36.668 --> 01:22:37.875
Tiger Two, roger.

01:22:37.876 --> 01:22:39.167
Tiger Three, roger.

01:22:39.168 --> 01:22:42.126
All birds, be on the lookout
for possible advanced weaponry.

01:22:58.251 --> 01:22:59.751
Approaching rooftop.

01:23:02.584 --> 01:23:04.126
Negative on the four sentries.

01:23:04.501 --> 01:23:05.793
Tiger Flight's on station.

01:23:06.418 --> 01:23:07.376
We got 'em.

01:23:08.293 --> 01:23:09.418
Go, go, go!

01:23:09.834 --> 01:23:11.459
Fast ropes deployed.

01:23:13.959 --> 01:23:16.376
We have a radar locked sourced
from target.

01:23:17.918 --> 01:23:19.667
Tiger Two's taking fire
from the rooftop!

01:23:19.668 --> 01:23:21.167
Tiger Team, go combat flight.

01:23:21.168 --> 01:23:23.000
Tiger Two's hit.He's going down.

01:23:23.001 --> 01:23:24.333
Tiger Two going down hard.

01:23:24.334 --> 01:23:25.418
Tiger Two's hit.

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:27.292
Evasive, evasive.

01:23:27.293 --> 01:23:28.543
Take out that target.

01:23:29.168 --> 01:23:30.584
Concentrate fire on that rooftop.

01:23:32.418 --> 01:23:34.292
Tiger Three, fly behind the target.

01:23:34.293 --> 01:23:35.625
Tiger Four, adjust approach!

01:23:35.626 --> 01:23:37.459
Head northwest and flank from there!

01:23:39.209 --> 01:23:42.583
Tiger Five and Six, switch to Formation
Charlie and take out that gun!

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:43.959
Damn it, drop altitude!

01:23:45.834 --> 01:23:47.459
Tiger One gunner just got hit!

01:23:55.293 --> 01:23:56.876
Watch your three. Watch your three.

01:23:57.293 --> 01:23:58.251
Taking fire.

01:23:58.626 --> 01:23:59.918
- Hold on!
- We're getting hit!

01:24:06.043 --> 01:24:07.209
Tiger Six is down!

01:24:10.918 --> 01:24:12.084
Tiger Five taking...

01:24:15.126 --> 01:24:16.584
Tiger Five's gone down.

01:24:18.959 --> 01:24:21.333
Reset formation. Tiger One taking lead.

01:24:21.334 --> 01:24:22.376
Roger that.

01:24:30.334 --> 01:24:31.418
We need backup!

01:24:32.334 --> 01:24:33.167
They're chewing us up!

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:34.875
Engaging Target. Provide cover.

01:24:34.876 --> 01:24:36.918
All remaining Blackhawks,
provide air cover.

01:24:44.376 --> 01:24:46.792
Two birds up. Only two birds remain.

01:24:46.793 --> 01:24:47.958
Abort! Abort!

01:24:47.959 --> 01:24:49.083
Pull out. Clear the area.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:50.584
Roger! Clearing the area!

01:24:53.376 --> 01:24:55.251
Tiger One is hit! Losing control!

01:24:59.459 --> 01:25:02.751
Tail rotor failure.
Mayday, mayday! We're going down!

01:25:32.626 --> 01:25:34.334
Five out of six birds are down.

01:25:34.918 --> 01:25:36.543
Requesting QRT.

01:25:38.418 --> 01:25:40.459
Permission to launch second squadron.

01:25:41.501 --> 01:25:42.750
Negative, negative.

01:25:42.751 --> 01:25:43.792
We don't have any intel about

01:25:43.793 --> 01:25:45.876
what other surprises
they could have for us.

01:25:47.001 --> 01:25:49.126
Return to base. Return to base. Over.

01:25:49.501 --> 01:25:50.459
Roger that.

01:25:56.251 --> 01:26:00.209
Banning, are you there? Banning!

01:26:04.251 --> 01:26:08.167
Half the White House is just gone.

01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:11.083
The residence, the roof,
all destroyed...

01:26:11.084 --> 01:26:13.918
and the remainder of
the historic building now trashed.

01:26:15.668 --> 01:26:16.793
Speaker Trumbull,

01:26:17.793 --> 01:26:20.501
that was a very foolish undertaking.

01:26:32.251 --> 01:26:34.084
Your president is next.

01:26:34.584 --> 01:26:37.875
You now have one hour
to recall the Seventh Fleet

01:26:37.876 --> 01:26:39.333
and your troops.

01:26:39.334 --> 01:26:42.583
Once you do so,
I want a helicopter on the North Lawn

01:26:42.584 --> 01:26:43.876
fueled and ready.

01:26:44.376 --> 01:26:45.751
60 minutes.

01:27:05.334 --> 01:27:06.168
Fuck.

01:27:07.126 --> 01:27:08.084
It's Banning.

01:27:08.626 --> 01:27:09.834
Patch him through.

01:27:10.209 --> 01:27:11.626
- Mike?
- Yeah.

01:27:12.501 --> 01:27:14.792
We've been trying to reach you, son.
Are you okay?

01:27:14.793 --> 01:27:18.501
Mr. Speaker, sir,
if we ever get out of this shit storm...

01:27:19.168 --> 01:27:21.168
you can hold me for insubordination.

01:27:22.584 --> 01:27:25.167
But your team needs
some serious fucking help.

01:27:25.168 --> 01:27:27.250
This is General Clegg,
Army Chief of Staff.

01:27:27.251 --> 01:27:29.792
I am ordering you to stand down.

01:27:29.793 --> 01:27:31.583
Remove your only eyes and ears
from the ground.

01:27:31.584 --> 01:27:32.792
That's fucking brilliant.

01:27:32.793 --> 01:27:35.625
We need to pull you out of there
before we lose another hostage!

01:27:35.626 --> 01:27:37.875
I am giving you a direct order.

01:27:37.876 --> 01:27:41.083
Newsflash, asshole.
I don't work for you.

01:27:41.084 --> 01:27:44.333
General Clegg.
I'm the Commander-in-Chief.

01:27:44.334 --> 01:27:47.208
If I didn't absolutely need you,
I would relieve you right now.

01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:48.667
I will not let this asshole
- General.

01:27:48.668 --> 01:27:50.250
- Blow up America, sir!
- I don't wanna here another word...

01:27:50.251 --> 01:27:52.543
out of you unless I ask you a question!

01:27:57.668 --> 01:27:58.626
Sir.

01:27:59.251 --> 01:28:00.459
Mr. Banning.

01:28:01.668 --> 01:28:03.126
Mr. Banning, are you there?

01:28:05.376 --> 01:28:06.751
Yes, sir. What's the plan?

01:28:08.376 --> 01:28:12.667
We're recalling the Seventh Fleet
pulling our troops back from the DMZ

01:28:12.668 --> 01:28:14.292
and giving them the helicopter.

01:28:14.293 --> 01:28:18.375
Sir, you cannot do that.
You cannot give this guy what he wants.

01:28:18.376 --> 01:28:20.500
I've dealt with
these types of men before.

01:28:20.501 --> 01:28:22.625
Give me some time. Let me flush him out.

01:28:22.626 --> 01:28:26.583
We are talking about the safety
of the President of the United States!

01:28:26.584 --> 01:28:28.918
We're talking about a hell of
a lot more than that, sir.

01:28:33.543 --> 01:28:36.959
With all due respect,
you're acting president now.

01:28:37.834 --> 01:28:39.751
And I'm the best hope you've got.

01:28:42.043 --> 01:28:44.168
Okay, Mike. You've got 30 minutes.

01:28:49.334 --> 01:28:51.208
Leah, call for you on the landline.

01:28:51.209 --> 01:28:52.501
The emergency line.

01:28:56.418 --> 01:28:58.000
Can you make sure he gets some morphine?

01:28:58.001 --> 01:28:58.793
Yes.

01:29:02.126 --> 01:29:03.001
Mike?

01:29:03.501 --> 01:29:05.543
Hey. I was just checking in.

01:29:07.209 --> 01:29:09.459
Babe. How's your day been?

01:29:11.084 --> 01:29:12.501
Yeah, it's been busy.

01:29:13.459 --> 01:29:15.084
It's good, you know.

01:29:16.543 --> 01:29:17.876
How 'bout you?

01:29:18.918 --> 01:29:21.293
Yeah. Busy.

01:29:22.251 --> 01:29:23.626
Hey, you okay?

01:29:24.126 --> 01:29:27.584
Yeah, I just, I've, I've had to stay
a little later than I expected.

01:29:28.834 --> 01:29:30.126
Yeah, me too.

01:29:32.501 --> 01:29:34.709
You're gonna come home tonight, right?

01:29:35.126 --> 01:29:36.958
Yeah. Sure.

01:29:36.959 --> 01:29:38.709
We got a date, remember?

01:29:39.459 --> 01:29:40.834
Hey, I gotta go.

01:29:41.168 --> 01:29:44.751
You know, this, uh,
paperwork's piling up.

01:29:45.251 --> 01:29:46.376
Okay.

01:29:49.668 --> 01:29:50.709
I love you.

01:30:11.543 --> 01:30:12.918
What's the matter, Kang?

01:30:13.334 --> 01:30:15.084
You look like you've seen a ghost.

01:30:15.668 --> 01:30:18.417
I guess you don't know
who you can trust, huh?

01:30:18.418 --> 01:30:19.542
It's over.

01:30:19.543 --> 01:30:23.375
No more televised executions.
No chopper.

01:30:23.376 --> 01:30:24.958
No more negotiating with you

01:30:24.959 --> 01:30:27.918
and the United People's Front
of Who Gives a Fuck.

01:30:28.751 --> 01:30:30.875
I will send the president out...

01:30:30.876 --> 01:30:32.792
one piece at a time.

01:30:32.793 --> 01:30:34.001
It won't matter.

01:30:34.418 --> 01:30:36.500
Because whatever you think
you accomplished

01:30:36.501 --> 01:30:38.293
you won't be alive to see it.

01:30:39.876 --> 01:30:41.168
Shut him down.

01:30:41.626 --> 01:30:44.000
Ah, you're not shutting me down, Kang.

01:30:44.001 --> 01:30:45.792
I'm here to stay.

01:30:45.793 --> 01:30:47.375
I underestimated you.

01:30:47.376 --> 01:30:49.083
It will not happen again.

01:30:49.084 --> 01:30:50.458
There is no again.

01:30:50.459 --> 01:30:54.042
You're gonna die down there alone
cut off from the rest of the world.

01:30:54.043 --> 01:30:57.667
My advice?
Save the last bullet for yourself.

01:30:57.668 --> 01:30:59.208
'Cause if you don't...

01:30:59.209 --> 01:31:01.709
I'm gonna stick my knife
through your brain.

01:31:02.043 --> 01:31:03.375
But don't worry.

01:31:03.376 --> 01:31:06.000
I'm gonna leak the photos
of your body to the press.

01:31:06.001 --> 01:31:08.334
You know, 'cause I know you
like that kind of shit.

01:31:27.293 --> 01:31:28.126
Her!

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:49.667
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

01:31:49.668 --> 01:31:54.418
of the United States of America!

01:32:08.876 --> 01:32:10.918
Your leader is out of his mind.

01:32:15.293 --> 01:32:17.501
You fucking idiot!

01:32:23.376 --> 01:32:24.334
Go.

01:32:24.876 --> 01:32:26.126
Walk.

01:32:26.918 --> 01:32:28.084
Move!

01:32:54.584 --> 01:32:57.208
Sir, there's movement
in front of the White House.

01:32:57.209 --> 01:32:58.583
Ours or theirs?

01:32:58.584 --> 01:33:00.500
Looks like Secretary McMillan, sir.

01:33:00.501 --> 01:33:02.876
- Any bulges, wires? -Negative.

01:33:08.668 --> 01:33:11.209
Sir, ground reports activity
at the White House.

01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:13.292
- Is that?
- McMillan.

01:33:13.293 --> 01:33:16.959
Get a team out there now.
And another to cover! Go!

01:33:20.543 --> 01:33:24.459
It looks like Secretary McMillan.
Yeah, yes, it is.

01:33:46.001 --> 01:33:46.959
Yes!

01:34:02.293 --> 01:34:03.209
Mike?

01:34:05.543 --> 01:34:06.458
Hey.

01:34:06.459 --> 01:34:08.751
He got away. He's back in the bunker.

01:34:09.584 --> 01:34:12.376
You gave it a good shot, Mike.
You saved McMillan.

01:34:13.834 --> 01:34:17.208
North and South Korean military
forces are on high alert

01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:20.292
in response to rumors
of an impending American

01:34:20.293 --> 01:34:22.042
pull-out from the DMZ.

01:34:22.043 --> 01:34:25.292
India, China and Russia
have declared a state of emergency

01:34:25.293 --> 01:34:27.125
and have mobilized military forces.

01:34:27.126 --> 01:34:27.958
In the Middle East though,

01:34:27.959 --> 01:34:31.167
the response to the attack
on the White House is jubilant.

01:34:31.168 --> 01:34:33.625
Crowds of thousands
are celebrating in the streets

01:34:33.626 --> 01:34:35.417
and American flags are burning.

01:34:35.418 --> 01:34:37.917
...created by a U.S. departure
could spark

01:34:37.918 --> 01:34:42.875
an immediate and full-scale conflict
and that any conventional war

01:34:42.876 --> 01:34:45.542
in this heavily-armed corner
of the world

01:34:45.543 --> 01:34:50.126
could easily escalate
into nuclear confrontation.

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:51.501
The hour's up.

01:34:52.334 --> 01:34:53.918
Send the helicopter.

01:34:55.668 --> 01:34:57.418
Le's recall the Seventh Fleet.

01:34:59.334 --> 01:35:01.500
Pull the troops out of the DMZ.

01:35:01.501 --> 01:35:03.376
We just lost South Korea.

01:35:05.668 --> 01:35:07.750
Our Pentagon sources are now saying

01:35:07.751 --> 01:35:08.917
that U.S. ground troops

01:35:08.918 --> 01:35:11.625
have been given the order
to withdraw from Korea

01:35:11.626 --> 01:35:14.042
for the first time in 60 years.

01:35:14.043 --> 01:35:16.625
We're also hearing reports
that the U.S.'s Seventh Fleet

01:35:16.626 --> 01:35:19.250
has been directed to pull back
in the region.

01:35:19.251 --> 01:35:20.625
Although unconfirmed,

01:35:20.626 --> 01:35:23.750
this historic turn of events
seems to be motivated

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:26.125
by today's attack on the White House

01:35:26.126 --> 01:35:28.625
which began
as the Prime Minister of Korea

01:35:28.626 --> 01:35:30.709
was meeting with President Asher.

01:35:55.293 --> 01:35:56.209
What are they doing?

01:36:33.543 --> 01:36:35.958
Mike. We have to get Kang
and the president out

01:36:35.959 --> 01:36:37.958
in the open and take out our best shot.

01:36:37.959 --> 01:36:39.043
Copy that, sir.

01:36:53.459 --> 01:36:55.293
Bravo Team is in position.

01:36:58.459 --> 01:37:01.168
Sir, we are ready.
All units are in position.

01:37:08.584 --> 01:37:09.876
Here come the hostages.

01:37:14.501 --> 01:37:16.251
We count 11 targets, sir.

01:37:16.751 --> 01:37:18.458
One of them's gotta be the president.

01:37:18.459 --> 01:37:19.584
That's their ticket out.

01:37:24.668 --> 01:37:26.751
Hercules Six in position.

01:37:27.209 --> 01:37:28.751
Can you I.D. the president?

01:37:31.751 --> 01:37:32.793
Negative.

01:37:33.251 --> 01:37:34.751
Can you I.D. Kang?

01:37:37.043 --> 01:37:37.917
Negative.

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:39.209
Targets unclear.

01:37:41.418 --> 01:37:43.125
Sir, all ground units are in position.

01:37:43.126 --> 01:37:45.293
Do we have the go-ahead to take them?

01:37:55.001 --> 01:37:56.668
If we're gonna go, we gotta go now, sir.

01:38:00.918 --> 01:38:02.418
Do we have the go-ahead, sir?

01:38:05.668 --> 01:38:08.334
No. Too risky.
They could kill the president.

01:38:10.793 --> 01:38:11.543
Yes, sir.

01:38:12.168 --> 01:38:14.208
It's okay.
We have a tracking device on the chopper.

01:38:27.418 --> 01:38:30.208
Holy shit. What was that? Was that us?

01:38:30.209 --> 01:38:32.334
Negative, negative. That wasn't us.

01:38:40.584 --> 01:38:44.042
Though it is not confirmed yet,
President Asher

01:38:44.043 --> 01:38:45.917
is believed to have been
among those killed

01:38:45.918 --> 01:38:48.000
when the Blackhawk helicopter went down

01:38:48.001 --> 01:38:50.251
in flames on the White House North Lawn.

01:38:51.626 --> 01:38:54.625
And certainly, today's events
will be recorded in history

01:38:54.626 --> 01:38:57.418
- as one of this country's darkest hours.
- Oh, my God.

01:39:00.626 --> 01:39:02.168
The president's gone.

01:39:20.876 --> 01:39:21.918
Mike?

01:39:22.501 --> 01:39:23.918
What the hell just happened?

01:39:25.043 --> 01:39:26.626
I'm sorry to report...

01:39:28.168 --> 01:39:30.459
the president was on that helicopter.

01:39:31.168 --> 01:39:32.459
And Kang?

01:39:33.209 --> 01:39:35.042
Kang killed himself.

01:39:35.043 --> 01:39:36.918
And all the other hostages.

01:39:38.793 --> 01:39:43.126
Wait. This doesn't add up.

01:39:44.293 --> 01:39:45.875
It doesn't make sense.

01:39:45.876 --> 01:39:47.334
What doesn't make sense?

01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:50.792
Kang would not go out like that, sir.

01:39:50.793 --> 01:39:52.168
That's not who he is.

01:39:54.001 --> 01:39:56.125
I think he's still in the bunker.

01:39:56.126 --> 01:39:58.668
And he has the president.
He's gonna try and slip away.

01:39:59.043 --> 01:40:01.042
If Kang is still on the premises
with the president,

01:40:01.043 --> 01:40:02.834
you can't let him leave.

01:40:04.376 --> 01:40:05.459
He won't.

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:10.043
Huh? Who the hell does that?

01:40:11.376 --> 01:40:12.334
Enough!

01:40:15.959 --> 01:40:18.542
I read your Bible, Mr. President.

01:40:18.543 --> 01:40:21.708
It says, the wages of sin is death.

01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:23.376
You better keep that in mind.

01:40:31.918 --> 01:40:32.708
What are you doing?

01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:34.625
Cerberus has been activated.

01:40:34.626 --> 01:40:36.376
We haven't launched any missiles yet.

01:40:38.126 --> 01:40:39.918
I don't need to launch them.

01:40:40.376 --> 01:40:43.000
The explosive force
within each hardened silo

01:40:43.001 --> 01:40:44.543
will detonate the missiles.

01:40:44.959 --> 01:40:47.418
Tens of millions of Americans
will perish.

01:40:48.126 --> 01:40:51.959
Your country will be a
cold, dark nuclear wasteland.

01:40:54.834 --> 01:40:58.626
Now, too, America shall know
suffering and famine.

01:41:00.876 --> 01:41:03.917
South Korean officials are saying
now that they've pulled out the reserves

01:41:03.918 --> 01:41:06.833
and they're mobilizing additional
armored units in response...

01:41:06.834 --> 01:41:09.458
Sir? Cerberus has been activated.

01:41:09.459 --> 01:41:11.418
- What?
- NORAD confirms.

01:41:12.834 --> 01:41:14.500
How did it come to this?

01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:16.792
We lost Korea and now our nukes?

01:41:16.793 --> 01:41:18.917
- They couldn't have broken the code.
- That would be impossible.

01:41:18.918 --> 01:41:21.417
They'd be on the bunker computer
for days to break three codes.

01:41:21.418 --> 01:41:23.917
No, he only need to break one code.

01:41:23.918 --> 01:41:26.209
But we haven't launched any missiles.

01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:31.834
They're gonna detonate them
in their silos.

01:41:34.501 --> 01:41:35.626
How many?

01:41:38.084 --> 01:41:39.293
All of 'em.

01:41:47.293 --> 01:41:49.334
He's just opened the gates of hell.

01:41:53.959 --> 01:41:55.418
Time to go, Mr. President!

01:42:05.293 --> 01:42:07.626
You really think you're gonna
get out of here alive?

01:42:08.334 --> 01:42:10.209
The world thinks we're both dead.

01:42:11.459 --> 01:42:13.334
And with you as insurance...

01:44:09.918 --> 01:44:11.043
Come on, Mike.

01:44:17.168 --> 01:44:19.126
Looks like you failed again, Mike.

01:44:46.626 --> 01:44:47.501
Sir?

01:44:48.001 --> 01:44:51.793
Sir, sir, look at me. Sir...

01:44:53.876 --> 01:44:54.876
Sir.

01:44:55.918 --> 01:45:00.083
Okay. It's gone through
and you've lost a little blood.

01:45:00.084 --> 01:45:01.751
But I'm gonna get you outta here, okay?

01:45:02.501 --> 01:45:03.793
Now, you know what to do.

01:45:06.001 --> 01:45:07.208
Ben, Ben, come on!

01:45:07.209 --> 01:45:09.042
- Cerberus.
- What?

01:45:09.043 --> 01:45:10.543
Cerberus activated.

01:45:10.959 --> 01:45:12.126
Cerberus.

01:45:14.918 --> 01:45:16.250
Keep that pressed in.

01:45:16.251 --> 01:45:17.668
Sir! Ben!

01:45:18.168 --> 01:45:19.500
You're gonna be okay.

01:45:19.501 --> 01:45:20.376
All right.

01:45:29.876 --> 01:45:31.042
This is Banning.

01:45:31.043 --> 01:45:33.167
I have the president.
He's hurt, but alive.

01:45:33.168 --> 01:45:34.918
How do I switch this fucking thing off?

01:45:35.418 --> 01:45:37.293
- Hang on.
- Deactivation code!

01:45:38.959 --> 01:45:42.709
Find a control panel marked,
"Countermand."

01:45:43.751 --> 01:45:44.709
Countermand.

01:45:45.543 --> 01:45:46.542
Got it!

01:45:46.543 --> 01:45:51.209
Flip a blue-white switch marked,
"Initiate Recall."

01:45:51.751 --> 01:45:53.209
Initiate recall.

01:45:53.959 --> 01:45:54.668
Okay.

01:45:55.168 --> 01:45:57.875
Deactivation sequence initiated.

01:45:57.876 --> 01:45:59.417
Please enter abort command.

01:45:59.418 --> 01:46:00.818
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

01:46:01.334 --> 01:46:04.958
November. India.

01:46:04.959 --> 01:46:06.125
Lima.

01:46:06.126 --> 01:46:10.000
- Wait, wait. Yep.
- 5-Oscar-hotel.

01:46:10.001 --> 01:46:12.750
- Oscar, hotel.
- Backslash. Niner.

01:46:12.751 --> 01:46:14.793
- Backslash.
- Victor. Kilo.

01:46:15.251 --> 01:46:16.625
- Hash-tag
- What?

01:46:16.626 --> 01:46:18.834
- Hash-tag.
- Shift 3!

01:46:19.334 --> 01:46:20.583
Okay, fuck!

01:46:20.584 --> 01:46:22.833
- Shift 3!
- Echo.

01:46:22.834 --> 01:46:24.042
Sierra.

01:46:24.043 --> 01:46:25.959
- Foxtrot.
- Foxtrot.

01:46:26.876 --> 01:46:27.833
Is that it?

01:46:27.834 --> 01:46:28.751
That's it.

01:46:34.793 --> 01:46:37.334
Cerberus has been deactivated.

01:46:46.959 --> 01:46:50.083
Sir. NORAD confirms...

01:46:50.084 --> 01:46:51.709
Cerberus has been shut down.

01:46:52.209 --> 01:46:53.334
Good.

01:46:53.751 --> 01:46:56.084
Now get me Seoul and Pyongyang
on the line.

01:47:25.418 --> 01:47:27.001
Are you ready, Mr. President?

01:47:38.293 --> 01:47:39.334
All right.

01:47:55.918 --> 01:47:57.626
Sorry about the house, sir.

01:47:59.876 --> 01:48:03.209
It's okay. I believe it's insured.

01:48:25.376 --> 01:48:26.918
We've lost good friends.

01:48:28.918 --> 01:48:30.043
Family.

01:48:31.918 --> 01:48:33.209
All good people.

01:48:36.043 --> 01:48:38.334
- Heroes, every one of them. -Dad!

01:48:39.334 --> 01:48:42.126
Our hearts and prayers
go out to their families.

01:48:42.876 --> 01:48:44.459
And they will be remembered.

01:48:45.543 --> 01:48:47.208
Nor will we forget...

01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:50.333
those who serve out of the spotlight

01:48:50.334 --> 01:48:54.001
to whom we owe our highest gratitude.

01:49:01.334 --> 01:49:05.168
Our foe did not come only to destroy
our things or our people.

01:49:06.168 --> 01:49:08.708
They came to desecrate a way of life.

01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:11.876
To foul our beliefs,
trample our freedom.

01:49:12.334 --> 01:49:14.834
And in this, not only did they fail...

01:49:15.376 --> 01:49:18.334
they granted us the greatest gift.

01:49:19.584 --> 01:49:21.459
A chance at our rebirth.

01:49:23.751 --> 01:49:26.543
We will rise. Renewed.

01:49:27.043 --> 01:49:29.084
Stronger and united.

01:49:29.584 --> 01:49:30.918
This is our time...

01:49:31.626 --> 01:49:35.918
our chance to get back
to the best of who we are.

01:49:36.751 --> 01:49:39.375
To lead by example with the dignity,

01:49:39.376 --> 01:49:42.126
integrity and honor
that built this country

01:49:42.793 --> 01:49:45.709
and which will build it once again.

01:49:46.084 --> 01:49:47.418
May God bless you.

01:49:48.543 --> 01:49:51.209
And may God bless
the United States of America.
