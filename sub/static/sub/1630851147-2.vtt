00:42.041 --> 00:43.041
WATCHER: <i>Time.</i>

00:46.500 --> 00:47.500
<i>Space.</i>

00:49.208 --> 00:50.208
<i>Reality.</i>

00:53.208 --> 00:54.916
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

00:59.708 --> 01:04.291
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

01:06.833 --> 01:10.291
<i>where a single choice</i>
<i>can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

01:13.000 --> 01:15.833
<i>creating alternate worlds</i>
<i>from the ones you know.</i>

01:19.958 --> 01:21.125
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

01:23.458 --> 01:26.625
<i>I am your guide</i>
<i>through these vast new realities.</i>

01:28.125 --> 01:31.708
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

01:35.208 --> 01:36.708
<i>"What if?"</i>

01:46.833 --> 01:51.208
<i>The galaxy, to your eyes,</i>
<i>a hundred billion points of light.</i>

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
<i>But where you see light, I see worlds</i>
<i>and the countless stories that fill them.</i>

02:00.208 --> 02:02.333
<i>But in a Multiverse</i>
<i>of infinite possibility,</i>

02:03.333 --> 02:09.583
<i>is your destiny determined by your nature</i>
<i>or by the nature of your world?</i>

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Drop it! Drop it now!

02:30.500 --> 02:32.000
Who are you?

02:32.083 --> 02:33.291
Identify yourself.

02:33.375 --> 02:36.250
STAR-LORD: Who, me?
I am just an ordinary junker.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.833
But there is one name you may know me by.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.125
Oh, my. Star-Lord!

02:46.208 --> 02:48.666
I'm a huge fan of your work.
What are you doing here?

02:48.750 --> 02:51.833
That was not the reaction I was expecting.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.500
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Stop! Show some respect.

02:55.583 --> 02:59.500
This is the Star-Lord, legendary outlaw.

02:59.583 --> 03:02.041
Steals from the powerful
and gives to the powerless.

03:02.125 --> 03:04.583
Should we be bowing?
I feel like we should be bowing.

03:04.666 --> 03:06.666
I mean, unless we should be kneeling.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.750
-Neither is necessary.
-Please.

03:08.833 --> 03:12.041
-You are a lord.
-It is not an official title.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.125
-Nor is it one I am comfortable with.
-(LAUGHS)

03:14.208 --> 03:17.875
Of course you would be humble.
Classic Star-Lord.

03:17.958 --> 03:20.458
I almost wish I didn't have
to take that from you.

03:20.541 --> 03:23.125
Surely something this powerful
is better off in my hands.

03:23.208 --> 03:27.083
It's just that my boss, Ronan,
super, super intense.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.166
But I could be convinced
to make a career change.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.125
Appreciate the interest,
but we're all staffed up.

03:32.208 --> 03:35.916
Oh, totally. Totally get it.
But at least now I get to spar with you.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.416
I guess if that's really what you want.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.541
Oh, it shall be the honor of my life.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.750
-Oh. Uh, should I not use the gun?
-Go ahead.

03:44.833 --> 03:45.916
-Really?
-Please.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.041
No, it's not a problem.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.500
-I'll get rid of it.
-It's okay.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.166
-You sure?
-Go ahead, use the gun.

03:50.250 --> 03:51.916
That is so generous of you.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.625
-Ready?
-KORATH: Oh, yes.

03:53.708 --> 03:54.791
Oh. (GROANING)

03:55.583 --> 03:58.708
You do not disappoint, my lord.
So nimble, so spry.

03:58.791 --> 03:59.875
I'm right here. Hit me.

04:00.583 --> 04:03.750
-Oh. My Lord! I didn't mean to...
-That is what we're here for.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.625
Do it again. But this time, faster.

04:05.708 --> 04:06.958
-Harder.
-Really?

04:08.458 --> 04:09.541
I barely moved. Hit me.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.458
Classic Star-Lord.

04:16.916 --> 04:19.000
Now I almost feel bad.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.541
Well, I have hired worse.

04:38.958 --> 04:42.166
SOLDIER: Freeze, Ravager.
We have you outnumbered.

04:42.250 --> 04:46.625
It would appear,
but a Ravager never flies solo.

04:53.291 --> 04:58.000
I said, "A Ravager never flies solo."

04:59.500 --> 05:02.666
Uh, is that some kind of catchphrase?

05:15.208 --> 05:16.916
You had me worried for a second.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.500
-Who's the Sleeping Beauty?
-A new recruit. He was after this as well.

05:20.583 --> 05:22.208
Mmm-hmm.

05:22.291 --> 05:24.541
Thermal signature's off the charts.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.958
You know, if we wanted
to have some real fun,

05:27.041 --> 05:28.166
we'd make like the old days

05:28.250 --> 05:30.333
and sell this bad boy
to the highest bidder.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.458
If we made like the old days,
you'd only have half of your teeth.

05:35.541 --> 05:38.000
Besides, wouldn't you rather use it
to jump-start

05:38.083 --> 05:41.666
the Krylorians' dying star,
save their system from extinction?

05:41.750 --> 05:44.625
You know as well as I,
no treasure is worth as much

05:44.708 --> 05:46.666
as the good that can be done with it.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.583
YONDU: Ah. That's my boy.

05:58.541 --> 06:01.583
WATCHER:<i> Though our hero's destiny</i>
<i>might lie in the stars above,</i>

06:01.666 --> 06:06.208
<i>the beginning of his journey</i>
<i>was much more down-to-earth.</i>

06:06.291 --> 06:08.625
T'CHALLA: I am tired
of living in a bubble.

06:08.708 --> 06:11.083
There's an entire world out there, <i>Baba.</i>

06:11.166 --> 06:15.041
Yes, one of war, violence, hatred.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.458
That world has nothing to offer Wakanda.

06:18.541 --> 06:21.708
There must be more. But we must be
brave enough to search for it.

06:21.791 --> 06:23.750
T'CHAKA: I do understand, my son.

06:23.833 --> 06:26.750
Though the blood of a king
runs through your veins,

06:26.833 --> 06:30.291
it is pumped by the heart of an explorer.

06:30.375 --> 06:34.166
But as someone who has ventured out
into the greater world,

06:34.250 --> 06:35.791
let me assure you,

06:36.375 --> 06:40.833
all you will find there
is destruction and pain.

06:40.916 --> 06:44.625
Those people do not understand
our way of life.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.125
WATCHER:<i> What you call destiny</i>
<i>is just an equation,</i>

06:50.916 --> 06:52.666
<i>-a product of variables.</i>
<i>-</i>(GRUNTS)

06:55.583 --> 07:00.208
WATCHER:<i> Right place, right time,</i>
<i>or in some instances,</i>

07:00.291 --> 07:03.166
<i>the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

07:03.250 --> 07:05.416
<i>As fate would have it,</i>
<i>at that very moment,</i>

07:05.500 --> 07:10.416
<i>a Ravager spacecraft was arriving on Earth</i>
<i>to abduct the spawn of the Celestial, Ego.</i>

07:11.291 --> 07:12.416
Cool.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.416
WATCHER:<i> But in this universe,</i>

07:15.500 --> 07:19.041
<i>Yondu outsourced the assignment</i>
<i>to his subordinates.</i>

07:20.833 --> 07:22.666
You morons grabbed the wrong kid.

07:22.750 --> 07:24.750
Uh-uh. Not so fast, Captain.

07:24.833 --> 07:28.458
Two see holes, two hear holes,
one eat hole.

07:28.541 --> 07:29.708
Everything checks out.

07:29.791 --> 07:32.541
Does this really look like
Peter Quill to y'all?

07:32.625 --> 07:35.208
Sure. I don't know.
All humans look alike to me.

07:35.291 --> 07:38.500
The cosmic readings where he was took
nearly broke our dial.

07:38.583 --> 07:42.541
If there was anything not from that planet
on that planet, it's there.

07:42.625 --> 07:46.083
Well, my home is built
on an ancient Vibranium meteorite.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.875
You sure don't seem too freaked out
about all this, kid.

07:48.958 --> 07:51.041
What you doing out there
all by yourself anyway?

07:51.125 --> 07:54.166
-Exploring the world.
-Sounds fun.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.041
But why stop at one world, huh?

07:56.750 --> 07:58.916
When we can show you all of them?

08:26.958 --> 08:29.708
-Ravagers!
-ALL: Ravagers!

08:31.041 --> 08:32.833
Star-Lord, if you had
to pick a favorite...

08:32.916 --> 08:34.500
Really, I could not say.

08:34.583 --> 08:37.791
I know, I know, so many heists,
so many planets saved.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.208
Still, you must have one.

08:39.291 --> 08:40.958
How could you choose just one?

08:41.041 --> 08:43.750
Oh! What about the Central Bank heist
of Tarnax IV?

08:43.833 --> 08:45.875
Never hurts to hurt a Skrull, right?

08:48.666 --> 08:50.541
That job paid for Kraglin's teeth.

08:50.625 --> 08:52.958
How about when you armed
the Ankaran resistance?

08:53.041 --> 08:55.416
Oh, man. Barely made it out of that one.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.750
How exactly did you stop Thanos,
the Mad Titan,

08:58.833 --> 09:01.458
from decimating half
of the universe? Oh, no.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.583
I'm a big enough man
to admit when I'm wrong.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.416
T'Challa here showed me
there was more than one way

09:06.500 --> 09:08.208
to reallocate the universe's resources.

09:08.291 --> 09:12.291
Sometimes the best weapon
in your arsenal is just a good argument.

09:12.375 --> 09:13.875
Aye, aye, Commander.

09:13.958 --> 09:17.041
Although I still assert
my plan was not without its merits.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.250
-Here we go.
-Please.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.791
Pretty sure it's still
just genocide, big guy.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.458
And I'm pretty sure it's efficient.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.583
Your money is no good here.

09:32.666 --> 09:35.583
-Please.
-No, seriously. We only take cash.

09:35.666 --> 09:38.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh... I have cash.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.375
Wait. You are <i>the</i> Star-Lord.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.625
You saved my home world
from a Kree invasion.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.125
-All in a day's work.
-No, it took several days.

09:45.208 --> 09:48.666
Six, in fact. Let us take a picture
to send to my wife and daughter.

09:48.750 --> 09:49.875
I would prefer-- (GROANS)

09:51.333 --> 09:54.666
Oh, we should take another one.
You look terrible. I look great.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.958
-I'm sure it's fine.
-No, I insist.

09:57.041 --> 09:59.375
-It is a truly awful picture of you.
-WOMAN: I don't know.

10:01.416 --> 10:03.958
He looks pretty good
from where I'm standing.

10:04.041 --> 10:05.291
Nebula.

10:05.375 --> 10:06.458
Hey, Cha-Cha.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.666
NEBULA: Pretty valuable loot you got here.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.541
The big guy know you have this?

10:12.625 --> 10:13.875
You mean your father?

10:15.166 --> 10:17.208
He's lucky I call him the big guy.

10:17.291 --> 10:18.666
You know, he gardens now.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.750
You should talk to him.
He really has changed.

10:20.833 --> 10:22.000
The past doesn't.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.250
You still wear your past around your neck.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.625
You ever think of going back?

10:26.708 --> 10:28.250
Not much to go back to.

10:29.166 --> 10:32.875
When I was young, Yondu attempted
to return me to Wakanda...

10:33.708 --> 10:34.958
but it had been destroyed.

10:36.375 --> 10:37.666
I'm sorry.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.875
Just another senseless war.

10:40.666 --> 10:44.666
<i>Baba</i> warned that was all humans know.
Turns out he was right.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.750
You lost your home,
and now you save everyone else's.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.291
That's the name of this tune, huh?

10:49.916 --> 10:52.083
(CHUCKLES) Something like that.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.708
Well, then, do I have a job for you.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.875
They're called the Embers of Genesis.

10:59.958 --> 11:02.583
Nutrient-rich cosmic dust
from an ancient supernova

11:02.666 --> 11:05.333
with the power
to terraform entire ecosystems.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.708
With one ounce,
you can heal a dying planet in minutes.

11:08.791 --> 11:10.666
And with a payload
the size we're talking...

11:10.750 --> 11:13.791
We could feed billions of people
on millions of worlds,

11:13.875 --> 11:16.000
and eradicate hunger across the galaxy.

11:16.083 --> 11:19.291
Don't tell Captain Genocide over here.
You might spoil his fun.

11:19.375 --> 11:21.041
(CHUCKLES) New guy's pretty funny.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.583
-I thought you work alone, daughter.
-Wait, wait, wait.

11:23.666 --> 11:25.625
You mean she's your offspring?

11:25.708 --> 11:27.666
-BOTH: Adopted.
-T'CHALLA: It's a long story.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.166
I've been trying
to get them into counseling.

11:30.250 --> 11:34.125
-So who's the mark?
-Taneleer Tivan, also known as...

11:34.208 --> 11:35.208
KRAGLIN: The Collector?

11:35.291 --> 11:38.791
As in the most ruthless kingpin
in the intergalactic underworld?

11:38.875 --> 11:40.666
-Wait, I thought that was you.
-THANOS: It was.

11:40.750 --> 11:41.833
But when I went straight,

11:41.916 --> 11:44.458
Tivan saw an opening
and filled the power vacuum.

11:44.541 --> 11:47.041
We can all agree
the Collector is dangerous.

11:47.125 --> 11:49.750
FYI, the Collector does not offer dental.

11:49.833 --> 11:53.291
This is suicide, T'Challa.
Not even I can get through his defenses.

11:53.375 --> 11:57.750
You dig? This maniac won't do you
the kindness of killing you.

11:57.833 --> 12:00.000
He'll dissect you for a science project,

12:00.083 --> 12:02.958
frame whatever's left
and hang you up on the wall.

12:03.041 --> 12:05.666
So should I mark you down as undecided?

12:05.750 --> 12:09.583
So long as the Collector's involved,
we are not.

12:17.625 --> 12:22.291
You may be the soul of this ship,
but I am still the captain.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.666
We are Ravagers.
We do not back down from a fight.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.875
No, no. We steal from the rich
and give to the poor,

12:28.958 --> 12:31.750
just like that earthling
folk hero of yours, right?

12:31.833 --> 12:33.375
-Robin Leach.
-Robin Hood.

12:33.458 --> 12:35.583
Whatever. That's our racket.

12:35.666 --> 12:37.750
We've been picking pockets
for loose coins.

12:37.833 --> 12:42.166
If we truly want to change the galaxy,
accomplish all we set out to do,

12:42.250 --> 12:44.833
then it's time we robbed the bank.

12:45.958 --> 12:49.958
Oh, jeez. Never have been any good
at saying no to you, kid.

12:51.625 --> 12:54.875
The Collector's got a famous kink
for exotic flora and fauna.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.708
The Embers will be housed
with the rest of his conquests, here.

12:57.791 --> 13:00.666
A museum that doubles
as his base of operations.

13:00.750 --> 13:04.666
A mining colony in a severed head
of an ancient celestial being.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.250
THANOS: He's got the Black Order
doing security.

13:09.333 --> 13:13.041
Take it from me, they're bad news.
How do you plan on sneaking past them?

13:13.125 --> 13:15.958
I don't. I'm gonna knock
on their front door like a lady.

13:17.625 --> 13:20.125
My Lady Nebula. Captain Udonta.

13:20.208 --> 13:22.708
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

13:22.791 --> 13:24.416
NEBULA:<i> Yondu and I will pose as sellers</i>

13:24.500 --> 13:27.041
<i>looking to unload that orb</i>
<i>you recovered on Morag.</i>

13:27.125 --> 13:29.208
<i>But really, it'll be T'Challa inside.</i>

13:29.291 --> 13:31.916
Our head of security, Proxima Midnight.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.291
Looks like they got an exhibit
running the museum.

13:34.375 --> 13:35.958
Hold it. Security scan.

13:38.458 --> 13:40.666
And that is when
you cause the distraction.

13:43.875 --> 13:45.625
Stop. I thought we were faking it.

13:45.708 --> 13:49.458
Yeah, well, try calling me
Captain Genocide again, new guy.

13:50.541 --> 13:53.291
Captain Genocide...(SCREAMS)

13:53.375 --> 13:56.833
T'CHALLA:<i> The Ravagers will start a riot,</i>
<i>drawing the attention of the Black Order.</i>

13:56.916 --> 13:58.250
We have a situation.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.875
All units report to our position.

14:00.958 --> 14:04.291
T'CHALLA:<i> Now, Yondu and Nebula</i>
<i>are free to distract the Collector,</i>

14:04.375 --> 14:06.416
<i>so that I can search for the Embers.</i>

14:13.666 --> 14:14.666
Amazing.

14:14.750 --> 14:17.541
I have no notes. A perfect plan.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.208
What could possibly go wrong?

14:19.291 --> 14:24.125
I present to you,
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.166
Oh, my dearest Nebula.

14:26.250 --> 14:28.333
Aren't you a sight for sore...

14:28.416 --> 14:31.791
Eye. Forgive me,
I couldn't help myself. (LAUGHS)

14:31.875 --> 14:34.875
Hey, you, creep-show.
If it's all the same to you,

14:34.958 --> 14:36.583
I'd just as soon get on with it.

14:36.666 --> 14:38.125
All business?

14:38.208 --> 14:43.291
And to think I'm old enough to remember
when the Ravagers used to be fun.

14:43.375 --> 14:46.583
What can I say?
We went straight and I got square.

14:46.666 --> 14:49.666
Hey, if you boys are done gossiping,
I brought what you asked.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.583
Ugh.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.416
The collection is much bigger
than I anticipated.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.333
All this suffering, and for what?

15:06.416 --> 15:09.000
My guess, he's compensating
for something big.

15:09.833 --> 15:12.000
Or small, if you catch my drift.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.958
You are quite articulate for a duck.

15:14.041 --> 15:16.958
That, sir, is very close-minded.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.250
You know, I, um...
I'm looking for something.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.875
The Embers of Genesis.
Do you know where I can find them?

15:21.958 --> 15:23.541
Cosmic flora, down the hall.

15:23.625 --> 15:26.625
Take a Louie at the Frost Giants,
a hard Ralph at the Kronans.

15:26.708 --> 15:30.250
You'll see a sign for Elvish literature.
Ignore that, total snooze.

15:30.333 --> 15:31.416
-Screw it.
-(QUACKS)

15:34.750 --> 15:36.208
Give me the tour.

15:38.416 --> 15:40.416
You know what they say,
"When you're out of luck,

15:40.500 --> 15:41.666
"always go duck."

15:41.750 --> 15:44.500
-I'm pretty sure no one says that.
-HOWARD: Oh, they say it.

15:44.583 --> 15:45.875
-T'CHALLA: Really?
-HOWARD: Totally.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.375
The Ravagers?

15:58.333 --> 16:01.041
It's a diversion.
Sound the alarms, lock down the building.

16:06.750 --> 16:09.208
(LAUGHS) The flashy flash.

16:09.291 --> 16:12.000
You always know how to bring the fun.

16:12.083 --> 16:13.958
Hold on, I need to hydrate.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.083
-We have to go.
-Where are you going? Come back.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.583
Are you crazy? Happy hour just started.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.958
It... It cannot be.

17:04.666 --> 17:08.333
<i>My son, T'Challa, Crown Prince of Wakanda,</i>

17:08.416 --> 17:12.083
<i>was abducted from Earth</i>
<i>by an alien spacecraft.</i>

17:12.166 --> 17:15.833
<i>If you have any information</i>
<i>regarding his whereabouts,</i>

17:15.916 --> 17:19.625
<i>we ask that you respond</i>
<i>to this homing beacon.</i>

17:20.458 --> 17:22.791
<i>-And T'Challa...</i>
<i>-Baba.</i>

17:22.875 --> 17:24.791
<i>...if you are out there,</i>

17:24.875 --> 17:30.583
<i>you're one bright burning light</i>
<i>in the night sky of billions,</i>

17:30.666 --> 17:35.666
<i>and we will search every last</i>
<i>one of them until we find you</i>

17:35.750 --> 17:38.458
<i>on this plane or the next.</i>

17:47.500 --> 17:50.750
Oh, Cha-Cha, I hope you can understand,

17:50.833 --> 17:53.833
I had a debt with the Collector
and you were the payment.

17:58.666 --> 18:03.958
Oh, T'Challa, now it's time
for one of your great escapes.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.500
You okay, kid?

18:05.583 --> 18:07.000
You lied to me!

18:07.083 --> 18:08.375
I was protecting you.

18:08.458 --> 18:11.791
Are we talking about the mission?
Or is this "family stuff"?

18:11.875 --> 18:14.166
You told me
my homeland had been destroyed.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.416
My family killed.

18:15.500 --> 18:16.750
How is that protecting me?

18:16.833 --> 18:18.916
Whoa. Guess it's family stuff.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.333
Sometimes you need to hear a lie
to see the truth.

18:22.416 --> 18:25.000
You're just like me, T'Challa.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.625
I am nothing like you.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.041
You're an explorer, Star-Lord.

18:32.791 --> 18:38.375
And for people like you, like us,
the past ain't nothing but a prison.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.583
You don't belong down there with them.

18:40.666 --> 18:45.250
You belong up here with us,
with your family.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.958
You are not my family.

18:48.458 --> 18:50.125
You never were.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.041
Damn, that hurts.

18:56.291 --> 18:58.541
The Collector is ready for you.

19:09.666 --> 19:13.875
I must apologize for all that
awkwardness back there with Nebula.

19:13.958 --> 19:15.833
I simply abhor drama.

19:15.916 --> 19:18.916
(CHUCKLES) Your outfit
would suggest otherwise.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.541
What is it you want with me, Tivan?

19:20.625 --> 19:23.291
There is a blank wall in the commissary

19:23.375 --> 19:26.916
that I just haven't been able
to find the right piece for.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.041
I am just an ordinary human,
hardly a work of art.

19:30.125 --> 19:35.500
Ah. I must admit now that
I see you in the flesh, you are.

19:37.291 --> 19:40.583
Are you sure you can't fly or shoot
lasers out of your eyes or something?

19:40.666 --> 19:43.250
Let's go a few rounds
and you can find out.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.458
Pass. I prefer you in the cage.

19:45.541 --> 19:46.666
Where I come from,

19:46.750 --> 19:50.500
history has never looked kindly
on those who lock men in cages.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.958
Maw, make a note.

19:53.041 --> 19:56.125
It appears he does
have a super power after all.

19:56.208 --> 19:59.541
He can bore someone to death
using only his sanctimony.

19:59.625 --> 20:01.458
Let's not waste the wall space.

20:01.541 --> 20:04.916
Dissect him
and strip his remains for parts.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.166
Daughter of mine.

20:12.250 --> 20:13.750
How could you do this to us?

20:13.833 --> 20:17.833
To my best friend, T'Challa.
You are the worst.

20:22.958 --> 20:25.125
But then again,
there are two sides to every story.

20:25.208 --> 20:27.666
Relax, new guy. I'm here to rescue you.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.458
Not like you to change your mind.

20:29.541 --> 20:31.375
Oh, I didn't. This was always the plan.

20:31.791 --> 20:34.708
<i>I told T'Challa that the Collector</i>
<i>was after him right from the jump.</i>

20:34.791 --> 20:36.791
-What is this job?
-More of a ruse.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.958
You see, I have this debt
with the Collector

20:39.041 --> 20:40.416
and, well, he's come to collect.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.625
-And what does he want?
-In a word, you, Cha-Cha.

20:44.416 --> 20:47.166
I had no idea about that Wakandan ship.

20:47.250 --> 20:51.041
All I knew was that we had an opening
to settle my debt with the Collector,

20:51.125 --> 20:53.375
and steal the Embers
right out from under him.

20:53.458 --> 20:56.500
(GASPS) So, all of this
has been a triple-cross?

20:56.583 --> 20:58.583
What? Classic Star-Lord.

20:58.666 --> 21:01.125
Hey, it was T'Challa's idea
to keep you in the dark.

21:01.208 --> 21:04.125
'Cause he knew I would never
let him walk into a trap.

21:04.208 --> 21:05.375
Look where we ended up.

21:05.458 --> 21:06.458
All a distraction,

21:06.541 --> 21:11.041
providing me the necessary cover
to obtain this, the Embers of Genesis.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.500
Hot damn. You guys are good.

21:14.583 --> 21:16.291
-What about T'Challa?
-NEBULA: Not to worry.

21:16.375 --> 21:19.916
He's keeping his escape plan
close to his chest.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.625
THE COLLECTOR: No, not like that, Carina.

21:21.708 --> 21:24.625
Even by a slave standard, you are foolish.

21:43.208 --> 21:46.291
I liked that thing you said
about not locking people in cages.

21:46.375 --> 21:48.708
Thank you. I am forever in your debt.

21:52.041 --> 21:55.291
PROXIMA MIDNIGHT: <i>The prisoners have</i>
<i>escaped. All units to sector seven.</i>

22:01.708 --> 22:04.958
What kind of being leaves a party
without saying goodbye?

22:05.041 --> 22:07.333
Something tells me
this happens to you a lot.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.625
Packs quite a wallop, does it not?

22:16.708 --> 22:19.708
I hacked it off the carcass
of a terribly chatty Kronan.

22:19.791 --> 22:21.791
Of course, if that's not your style,

22:21.875 --> 22:24.833
there's plenty more
we can play with. Observe.

22:27.666 --> 22:32.750
A dagger forged in dark matter
taken from the ruler of the Dark Elves.

22:33.583 --> 22:37.291
Or perhaps you prefer something
a touch more elegant?

22:40.916 --> 22:44.250
Oh. That woman had taste!

22:44.333 --> 22:48.625
A necrosword, courtesy
of the Asgardian Goddess of Death.

22:53.041 --> 22:54.791
-Whoa.
-(LAUGHS)

23:03.291 --> 23:05.708
-NEBULA: Run!
-We were running.

23:05.791 --> 23:07.958
Okay, we'll run faster.

23:18.708 --> 23:20.500
-Get to the ship.
-Are you crazy?

23:20.583 --> 23:23.208
-You'll never take them yourself.
-Not crazy...

23:25.833 --> 23:26.833
Mad.

23:59.625 --> 24:00.833
A pity.

24:00.916 --> 24:04.750
You abandoned your home and family,

24:04.833 --> 24:08.041
and now, your new family
has abandoned you. Karma.

24:08.125 --> 24:11.875
Maybe you haven't heard,
a Ravager never flies solo.

24:15.875 --> 24:19.083
Yondu, sweet! Now it's a party.

24:19.166 --> 24:23.250
Ain't no way in hell
I was going to leave here without my kid.

24:57.708 --> 24:59.375
Eat this.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.291
Let's go. Punch it!

25:29.458 --> 25:32.125
-What about Yondu and T'Challa?
-I'm sure they're doing fine.

25:45.708 --> 25:47.958
-Okay, any ideas?
-Sticky fingers.

25:48.041 --> 25:49.083
Could work.

25:49.166 --> 25:51.083
-Who's the glue?
-You are.

25:51.166 --> 25:53.750
-Because you lied to me.
-Fair point.

26:02.041 --> 26:03.375
YONDU: Is that all you got?

26:17.750 --> 26:19.750
You think this can contain me?

26:19.833 --> 26:23.833
Cute. No matter where you go
or how far you hide,

26:23.916 --> 26:28.083
there is not a corner
in this galaxy beyond my grasp.

26:28.166 --> 26:30.791
Sure, sure. Whatever. Cool story.

26:32.583 --> 26:34.958
I trust you'll know what to do with this.

26:35.041 --> 26:37.625
Oh, I have some ideas.

26:37.708 --> 26:40.083
Carina, can I have my bracelet now?

26:40.166 --> 26:42.708
No touching, Carina. No!

26:43.541 --> 26:47.541
No, no, no, no. Stay. Stop!

26:47.625 --> 26:51.208
Stop and think. I took care of all of you.
I put a roof over your heads.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.250
Oh. Karma.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.416
YONDU: We're never getting
out on foot.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.375
Then we'll take to the skies.

27:11.666 --> 27:15.208
<i>All crew members present</i>
<i>and accounted for by some miracle.</i>

27:15.291 --> 27:17.916
Then I will see you
at the rendezvous point.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.500
<i>Copy that, Cha-Cha.</i>

27:22.166 --> 27:24.125
Looks like we've got a stowaway.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.916
You always did have
a soft spot for runaways.

27:27.583 --> 27:32.083
-Look, T'Challa, I just wanted to say--
-There's no need.

27:32.166 --> 27:35.333
I was the one who told you
I wanted to see the world.

27:35.416 --> 27:38.541
All you did was show me the universe.

27:39.375 --> 27:43.166
Oh, yeah.
She really is a beaut, isn't she?

27:43.250 --> 27:45.125
T'CHALLA: I've always
felt at home up here.

27:45.208 --> 27:50.125
But now, knowing everything,
I'm not quite sure where I belong.

27:50.208 --> 27:53.458
Seen a lot of space travelers
in my day, kid.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.875
And if I've learned anything
from watching you,

27:56.458 --> 27:59.583
on any planet, among any people,

27:59.666 --> 28:03.708
there ain't no place in this galaxy
where you don't belong.

28:05.125 --> 28:08.375
Where you want to be,
that's the question, isn't it?

28:09.750 --> 28:13.916
You're just gonna have to follow
your heart on that one, Mr. Star-Lord.

28:36.166 --> 28:39.333
<i>-Baba.</i>
-(VOICE SHAKING) My son, my son.

28:39.416 --> 28:43.291
I knew you would find your way home to us.

28:43.375 --> 28:45.041
I'm sorry it took me so long.

28:45.125 --> 28:48.208
Let me introduce you
to the family I made along the way.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.333
Uh, you must be T'Challa's father.

28:50.416 --> 28:54.666
Uh, pleased to meet you, sir.
Your son is a galactic hero.

28:54.750 --> 28:57.875
My friend, that sounds
an awful lot like genocide.

28:57.958 --> 29:00.666
-No, no, no. Because it's random.
-Uh-huh.

29:00.750 --> 29:03.208
And I might add, efficient.

29:03.291 --> 29:04.541
(GROANS) Dad!

29:04.625 --> 29:07.208
I mean, if you really wanted
to put a label on it,

29:07.291 --> 29:08.750
T'Challa and I are best friends.

29:08.833 --> 29:10.375
Oh, yeah, jump points are the best.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.875
They make your face all scrambly,
but they're a lot of fun.

29:12.958 --> 29:18.833
I am still wondering how exactly
my son came to be in your spaceship.

29:19.250 --> 29:22.875
Funny story, Your Highness.
You see, I took this job--

29:22.958 --> 29:25.916
I was lost, <i>Baba.</i> Yondu found me.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.333
WATCHER:<i> And from one family reunion</i>
<i>to another...</i>

29:33.000 --> 29:36.500
<i>I saw your eyes</i>

29:39.625 --> 29:41.791
<i>And you made me smile</i>

29:41.875 --> 29:43.458
Uh, sorry. We're closed.

29:43.541 --> 29:48.250
What, Peter? Can't spare
a little time for dear old Dad?

29:48.333 --> 29:50.583
WATCHER:<i> Too bad this might spell</i>
<i>the end of the world.</i>

29:51.166 --> 29:53.166
<i>But that's a story for another day.</i>

29:53.291 --> 29:55.208
<i>I was falling in love</i>
