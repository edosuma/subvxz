WEBVTT

00:08.909 --> 00:11.045
- DR. WESTON?
- YES.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.314
I'M WALTER'S
DAUGHTER NATALIE.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.749
OH, VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU, NATALIE.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.785
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
- OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.953
HOW IS, UM--

00:20.054 --> 00:22.223
HOW IS YOUR FATHER DOING?

00:22.323 --> 00:24.392
PHYSICALLY HE'S OKAY.

00:24.492 --> 00:28.629
UH, MY MOTHER SAYS
TO TELL EVERYONE HE
HAS FOOD POISONING.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.266
YES.
THAT'S--

00:32.366 --> 00:35.803
- THAT'S WHAT SHE TOLD ME.
- AND YOU BELIEVED HER?

00:39.039 --> 00:41.409
( theme music playing )

01:13.107 --> 01:15.576
( softly )
WALTER?

01:22.950 --> 01:25.553
WALTER?

01:27.020 --> 01:28.656
WALTER.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.692
I'M NOT HUNGRY.
I DON'T NEED ANY PILLS.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.365
IT'S PAUL.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.334
PAUL WESTON.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.371
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:43.471 --> 01:45.906
YOU MISSED YOUR SESSION.
I CALLED YOUR HOME.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.876
CONNIE TOLD ME THAT YOU'D...

01:48.976 --> 01:51.279
YOU'D BEEN ADMITTED
LAST NIGHT.

01:53.046 --> 01:56.049
- AND SHE ASKED YOU
TO CHECK IN ON ME?
- I'D HAVE COME ANYWAY.

01:56.150 --> 01:59.820
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT
HAVING TO CANCEL MY SESSION
LAST WEEK, SO...

01:59.920 --> 02:03.491
WELL, YOU CAN TELL CONNIE
YOU SAW ME AND I SENT
YOU HOME.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.294
THEY'RE GONNA BE
DISCHARGING ME TOMORROW.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.462
WE'LL HAVE
A SESSION NEXT WEEK.

02:08.562 --> 02:12.233
I'M NOT
SO SURE THEY'RE GONNA
DISCHARGE YOU, WALTER.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.605
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

02:17.705 --> 02:22.075
YOU-- YOU MAY NOT BE
READY TO GO HOME.

02:22.176 --> 02:25.879
OF COURSE I AM.
I HAD A LITTLE
FOOD POISONING.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.048
- I'M FINE.
- OH.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.418
FOOD POISONING?

02:30.518 --> 02:33.621
WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

02:35.189 --> 02:38.426
WELL, SINCE YOU'RE FINE,

02:38.526 --> 02:41.295
AND I'M HERE,
MAYBE WE CAN--
MAYBE WE CAN TALK.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.631
- WILL IT HELP
GET ME OUT OF HERE?
- IT COULD.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.099
WELL, THEN TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.936
FIRST OFF,

02:49.036 --> 02:51.405
ARE THEY TREATING
YOU WELL HERE?

02:51.505 --> 02:54.107
YEAH, IT'S--
IT'S A LITTLE SHOWY

02:54.208 --> 02:55.743
FOR A HOSPITAL,

02:55.843 --> 02:58.846
BUT THE STAFF'S GOOD.
THEY'RE IN AND OUT ALL THE TIME,

02:58.946 --> 03:02.049
BUT NO,
I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS.

03:02.149 --> 03:05.085
- SO I'LL BET YOU'LL BE
GLAD TO GET HOME.
- OH YEAH.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.489
YEAH, I REALLY MISS
MY PRIVACY, KNOWING
WHERE MY THINGS ARE.

03:08.589 --> 03:12.059
- CONNIE.
- ACTUALLY, I SPOKE
WITH CONNIE.

03:12.159 --> 03:15.829
SHE TOLD ME THAT
NATALIE WAS LEAVING
TO FLY BACK TO RWANDA.

03:15.929 --> 03:19.066
YOU HAD AN EARLY DINNER
WITH BOTH OF THEM,
SHE TOLD ME.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.835
YEAH, WE ATE IN.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.537
I DON'T GO OUT.
PEOPLE GAWK.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.740
AND THEY BOTH ATE
THE SAME MEAL AS YOU DID?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.342
RIGHT.
CHINESE.

03:28.442 --> 03:32.380
BUT THEY DIDN'T GET
FOOD POISONING.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.649
SO MAYBE I GOT A BUG.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.923
( sighs )
I ALSO TALKED TO YOUR
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.960
- HE SAID THAT YOU WERE LUCKY.
- LUCKY?

03:47.060 --> 03:50.230
MM-HMM.
THAT NATALIE'S FLIGHT
WAS CANCELED.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.066
I DON'T FOLLOW YOU.

03:53.166 --> 03:56.370
SHE GOT A CALL
FROM THE AIRLINE WHILE
YOUR WIFE WAS DRIVING HER.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.106
THEY TURNED AROUND BEFORE
THEY EVEN GOT TO THE AIRPORT.

03:59.206 --> 04:02.310
OH, SO THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED.

04:02.410 --> 04:06.647
- ANOTHER HALF HOUR,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT.
- I GUESS IT WASN'T MY TIME.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.651
UH, NOT NOW, PLEASE.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.329
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

04:23.664 --> 04:26.600
WHAT'S TO TELL?
I KISSED NATALIE GOODBYE.

04:26.700 --> 04:31.171
I CAUGHT
A CHILL AFTER SHE LEFT
SO I GOT BACK INTO BED.

04:31.271 --> 04:35.676
WHEN I WOKE UP,
I WAS HERE.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.013
HAD YOU BEEN SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME IN BED?

04:41.649 --> 04:44.318
I DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE
ELSE TO BE, DO I?

04:45.719 --> 04:49.457
OKAY.
AND YOUR DAUGHTER NATALIE,

04:49.557 --> 04:51.959
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN
IN NEW YORK?

04:52.059 --> 04:55.396
A WEEK, 10 DAYS.

04:58.632 --> 05:02.803
I TOLD YOU CONNIE
OVERREACTED TO MY...

05:04.004 --> 05:06.407
MY FORCED RETIREMENT,

05:06.507 --> 05:09.643
SENT OUT AN S.O.S.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.245
THE BOYS CAME IN FIRST
FROM CALIFORNIA.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.114
- AND HOW WAS THAT?
- WHEW.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.083
AWKWARD AS HELL.

05:16.183 --> 05:19.520
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TALK
TO THEM; THEY DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO TALK TO ME.

05:19.620 --> 05:24.024
WE WATCHED BASKETBALL,
RERUNS.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.660
MY OLDER ONE
ATE MY FOOD.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.464
THE YOUNGER ONE WAS UPSET
THAT THERE WAS NO BOOZE
IN THE HOUSE,

05:30.564 --> 05:32.766
SO HE WENT OUT AND GOT
A BOTTLE OF SINGLE MALT.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.703
AFTER THAT I NEVER SAW HIM
WITH AN EMPTY GLASS.

05:36.370 --> 05:39.106
THEN NATALIE CAME.

05:39.206 --> 05:42.275
AND THE SECOND SHE GOT IN,
THEY BEAT IT THE HELL
OUT OF THERE.

05:42.376 --> 05:45.679
AND SHE CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM RWANDA.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.783
PAUL, I KNOW WHERE
SHE WAS LIVING.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.453
YES, BUT IT'S
JUST THAT YOU'D SAID
BEFORE THAT YOU FELT

05:52.553 --> 05:55.022
THAT SHE WAS DONE WITH YOU.

05:55.122 --> 05:58.291
YEAH, WELL, CONNIE
MUST HAVE REALLY LAID
A GUILT TRIP ON HER.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.260
AND HOW WAS IT
SEEING HER?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.563
UNCOMFORTABLE.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.265
SHE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED OVER THERE,

06:05.365 --> 06:09.470
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
I TOLD HER I WASN'T
IN THE MOOD FOR SMALL TALK,

06:09.570 --> 06:12.139
SHE MADE ME GET OUT
OF BED AND SHOWER,

06:12.239 --> 06:14.542
SHAVE, GET DRESSED.

06:14.642 --> 06:17.010
MADE ME GO OUT
ON WALKS IN THE PARK.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.781
SHE EVEN TOOK ME
TO THE ZOO.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.485
SHE USED TO LOVE GOING THERE
WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.854
SO YOUR MOOD IMPROVED
WHEN SHE WAS HERE.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.758
DID YOU FIND IT UPSETTING

06:30.858 --> 06:33.727
- WHEN SHE HAD TO LEAVE?
- NO.

06:35.228 --> 06:39.099
WELL, OF COURSE I WAS UPSET,
BUT I WANTED HER TO GO.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.702
SO WHETHER OR NOT YOU
REALLY WERE FEELING BETTER,

06:41.802 --> 06:44.204
- YOU MADE SURE THAT
THEY BOTH THOUGHT YOU WERE.
- NO.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.640
I TOLD YOU--
I WAS BETTER.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.309
OKAY.

06:49.409 --> 06:53.213
SO YOU HAD YOUR LAST MEAL
WITH NATALIE, YOU KISSED
HER GOODBYE,

06:53.313 --> 06:55.949
THEY LEFT
AND YOU FINALLY HAD...

06:57.050 --> 06:58.218
YOUR PRIVACY.

06:58.318 --> 07:01.689
WHAT I HAD
WAS THE CHILLS.

07:03.724 --> 07:07.695
- AND WHAT DID YOU TAKE
FOR THE CHILLS?
- ASPIRIN.

07:07.795 --> 07:11.331
ANTACID.
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.867
THEY PUMPED
YOUR STOMACH, WALTER.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.239
YOU WERE PRETTY FAR GONE.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.174
AND IT WASN'T FROM ANTACIDS.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.647
SO WHAT?
PROBABLY WHAT
HAPPENED WAS

07:26.747 --> 07:29.617
I DRIFTED OFF,
WOKE UP, REACHED OUT
FOR THE WRONG PILLS

07:29.717 --> 07:31.552
- IN MY SLEEP.
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

07:31.652 --> 07:35.523
- WELL, WHAT THE FUCK
WOULD YOU KNOW?
- BECAUSE IT'S MY JOB TO KNOW.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.560
AND I AM OBLIGATED
TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN

07:39.660 --> 07:42.496
TO DR. WELLS
AND THE REST OF THE TEAM HERE.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.300
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
CONCERNED, PAUL.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.103
MY FAMILY ISN'T
GOING TO SUE YOU.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.142
THEY'RE NOT LIKE
THAT PILOT'S FAMILY.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.844
WHAT?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.814
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT, ISN'T IT?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.190
I SHOULD HAVE
VETTED YOU SOONER.

08:10.290 --> 08:14.127
BUT SOMEONE ON YOUR SCHOOL--
I'M ON THE BOARD, BY THE WAY,

08:14.227 --> 08:15.963
OR WAS--
RECOMMENDED YOU

08:16.063 --> 08:17.230
AND, LIKE I SAY,

08:17.330 --> 08:19.332
I'VE BEEN DROPPING
MY GUARD LATELY.

08:19.432 --> 08:23.804
I THINK YOU CAN STILL
PACK A PRETTY MEAN PUNCH
IF YOU WANT TO.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.707
YOU SEEM LIKE
A SMART FELLOW.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.810
AND I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
ANYONE WHO COULD HURT ME.

08:29.910 --> 08:34.081
BUT STILL, WHEN THE LEAKS
STARTED TO REALLY HIT
THE PAPERS,

08:34.181 --> 08:37.517
I TOLD MARIE TO HAVE H.R.
RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK
ON YOU.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.120
WHAT DID YOU THINK
WHEN YOU'D READ IT?

08:40.220 --> 08:43.523
YOU MEAN ASIDE
FROM WONDERING IF YOU WERE
IN OVER YOUR HEAD WITH ME?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.660
I HAD OTHER THINGS
GOING, PAUL.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.696
I DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT
UNTIL LAST WEEK.

08:48.796 --> 08:52.499
LAST WEEK--
AFTER I HAD TO CANCEL.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.769
- PROBABLY AROUND THERE.
- DID YOU FEEL I LET YOU DOWN
BY CANCELING?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.838
NO, ACTUALLY
I WAS RELIEVED.

08:57.938 --> 09:02.610
I DIDN'T WANT TO COME IN
AND GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.645
IS THAT WHAT COMING
TO SESSION FEELS LIKE?

09:04.745 --> 09:07.114
THAT'S WHAT EVERYTHING
FEELS LIKE.

09:07.214 --> 09:10.017
I WASN'T UPSET.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.485
BUT I WAS SURPRISED.

09:12.586 --> 09:18.025
YOU CONVINCED ME
THAT YOU WERE ANGRY ABOUT
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME

09:18.125 --> 09:21.461
- AND THAT YOU WERE ON MY SIDE.
- AND WHEN I MISSED A SESSION?

09:21.561 --> 09:25.799
( exhales ) BOY, YOU
REALLY HAVE A HIGH OPINION
OF YOURSELF, DON'T YOU?

09:25.899 --> 09:29.737
STILL, I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE
THAT'S WHEN YOU DECIDED TO
READ THE BACKGROUND CHECK.

09:29.837 --> 09:33.173
I HAD TIME ON MY HANDS.
AND BLOOD.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.008
JUST LIKE YOU.

09:38.378 --> 09:41.414
IS THAT ALSO
WHAT YOU THOUGHT

09:41.514 --> 09:44.417
WHEN YOU READ
ABOUT THE LAWSUIT?

09:44.517 --> 09:46.253
OH, WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

09:46.353 --> 09:49.623
YOU KEEP SAYING "WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE," WALTER,
BUT I THINK IT DOES.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.659
WITH ALL
DUE RESPECT, PAUL,

09:51.759 --> 09:53.526
DON'T FLATTER
YOURSELF.

09:53.627 --> 09:56.529
IF YOU'D BEEN THERE
OR NOT IT WOULDN'T
HAVE MATTERED ONE BIT.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.531
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOUR MIND WAS MADE UP,

09:58.632 --> 10:00.668
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IT
ANYWAY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.771
DONE WHAT?
I WENT TO SLEEP.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.141
I WENT TO SLEEP.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.343
MM-HMM.

10:10.443 --> 10:14.815
OKAY.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.887
WHAT WAS IT,
A HANDFUL OF PILLS?

10:21.054 --> 10:23.691
A COUPLE OF SHOTS
OF YOUR SON'S SCOTCH?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.559
HMM?

10:26.660 --> 10:29.329
- IT MUST HAVE BEEN
EVERYTHING YOU COULD DO--
- WHAT?

10:30.530 --> 10:33.400
TO HOLD ON
UNTIL NATALIE WAS GONE.

10:37.771 --> 10:42.009
WHAT WAS SHE SUPPOSED TO DO,
TAKE CARE OF ME FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE?

10:42.109 --> 10:47.180
BOTH OF THEM--
OPENING THE BLINDS,
FLUFFING THE FUCKING PILLOWS,

10:47.280 --> 10:49.616
MAKING SURE I'M DRESSED.

10:49.717 --> 10:52.185
THEY WERE WORRYING
THEMSELVES SICK ABOUT ME.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.887
AND YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.889
NO!

10:55.989 --> 10:59.693
SO I-- I FORCED MYSELF
TO START EATING AGAIN.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.796
I STOPPED TAKING THE PILLS.
I SQUIRRELED THOSE AWAY.

11:02.896 --> 11:06.834
I PRETENDED TO SLEEP
THROUGH THE NIGHT

11:06.934 --> 11:09.837
JUST SO THEY'D FINALLY
LEAVE ME ALONE FOR A FEW HOURS.

11:09.937 --> 11:14.374
A FEW HOURS,
THAT'S ALL YOU NEEDED THEN?

11:14.474 --> 11:17.845
I TOLD CONNIE THAT SHE COULDN'T
LET NATALIE TAKE A CAR SERVICE
TO THE AIRPORT.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.247
SO YOU FIGURED THAT CONNIE
WOULDN'T JUST DROP HER OFF.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.382
SHE'D WAIT AT THE AIRPORT
FOR A WHILE...

11:22.482 --> 11:25.418
SO YOU WOULD HAVE
ENOUGH TIME.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.121
I-- I WANTED NATALIE
UP IN THE AIR,

11:28.221 --> 11:30.190
AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS
AS POSSIBLE.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.326
AND CONNIE WAS JUST SUPPOSED
TO COME HOME AND FIND ME ASLEEP.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.262
A MILLIONAIRE'S DEATH.

11:35.362 --> 11:39.733
- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
- YES, I THINK I HEARD MY FATHER
USE THAT EXPRESSION.

11:39.833 --> 11:43.170
YEAH, MINE TOO.
YOU GO TO BED ONE NIGHT

11:43.270 --> 11:44.905
AND YOU DON'T WAKE UP.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.742
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.678
I TOOK THE PILLS,

11:51.779 --> 11:53.680
CHASED THEM DOWN,

11:53.781 --> 11:55.949
TOOK A FEW MORE.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.888
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE GIRLS COMING BACK.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.326
I MUST HAVE VOMITED
ALL OVER THE BED.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.930
I JUST WANTED IT TO BE OVER,
THAT'S ALL.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.034
IT'S OKAY, WALTER.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.269
IT'S OKAY.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.138
I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.473
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.776
( door opens )

12:25.245 --> 12:28.481
JUST LEAVE IT
ON THE TABLE.
THANK YOU.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.629
- DOES EVERYONE
IN THE HOSPITAL KNOW?
- NO.

12:42.729 --> 12:45.665
YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD
TEAM OF DOCTORS.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.136
THEY ASSESSED THE SITUATION
THE NIGHT THAT--

12:49.236 --> 12:51.138
YOU CAME IN.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.506
- IS IT IN THE PAPERS?
- NO.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.309
FOR HOW LONG?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.751
I DIDN'T LEAVE A NOTE.

13:04.852 --> 13:08.655
I LEFT THE TV ON,
LEFT THE LIGHTS ON.

13:08.755 --> 13:11.524
NOBODY WAS SUPPOSED
TO KNOW.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.263
( sighs )
JUST AN OLD MAN

13:16.363 --> 13:20.267
ASLEEP UNDER THE COVERS.

13:20.367 --> 13:24.704
WELL, THE DOORMAN
WOULD HAVE HELPED.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.141
SHORT TERM, CONNIE
WOULD HAVE MOURNED,

13:28.241 --> 13:31.711
BUT SHE HAS
A SUPPORT SYSTEM.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.882
LONG TERM, SHE'D BE
A HELLUVA LOT BETTER OFF

13:34.982 --> 13:37.384
AS MY WIDOW THAN MY WIFE.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.853
I'M SURE SHE WOULD NOT
AGREE WITH THAT, WALTER.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.789
SHE DIDN'T SIGN ON
FOR THIS, PAUL.

13:42.890 --> 13:47.527
- FOR WHAT?
- TO HAVE A DISGRACED
BASKET CASE AS A HUSBAND.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.130
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE FOR HER?

13:51.698 --> 13:55.002
SHE'S BEEN A C.E.O.s WIFE
AND NOW SHE HAS TO SNEAK OUT

13:55.102 --> 13:57.604
THROUGH THE SERVICE ENTRANCE
OF THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR LIKE--

13:57.704 --> 14:00.273
- LIKE YOU DO.
- IT'S NOT THE SAME.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.309
- IT'S DIFFERENT FOR ME.
- AND WHY IS THAT?

14:02.409 --> 14:05.678
- BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.
- AND YOU DID?

14:05.778 --> 14:08.681
EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENED TO YOU, WALTER,

14:08.781 --> 14:11.584
YOU FEEL THAT
YOU'VE DESERVED IT?
IS THAT THE WAY YOU THINK?

14:11.684 --> 14:15.155
PEOPLE DIED
ON MY WATCH, PAUL.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.057
LET'S NOT PRETEND
OTHERWISE.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.492
AND ANYONE WHO'S
WORRIED ABOUT YOU

14:19.592 --> 14:22.662
WOULD BE BETTER OFF
IF YOU WEREN'T AROUND?

14:22.762 --> 14:24.998
WELL, IT'S JUST
THE OBJECTIVE TRUTH.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.934
YOU MET MY DAUGHTER?

14:27.034 --> 14:29.836
SHE'S GOT HER WHOLE LIFE
AHEAD OF HER.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.772
NOW WHAT?
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO JUST
PUT IT ON HOLD

14:32.872 --> 14:35.375
AND WORRY ABOUT WHETHER
HER OLD MAN

14:35.475 --> 14:37.677
GOT OUT OF BED THAT MORNING
OR TOOK A SHAVE?

14:37.777 --> 14:39.379
I'VE MET NATALIE.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.483
AND SHE'S IN
A TERRIFYING PLACE RIGHT NOW.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.086
BUT AS HARD AS IT IS
FOR HER TO WORRY ABOUT YOU,

14:46.186 --> 14:49.122
I'M ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
THAT IF YOU'D MANAGED
TO KILL YOURSELF,

14:49.222 --> 14:51.591
SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE
FORGIVEN HERSELF.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.434
( exhales )

15:01.534 --> 15:04.204
THE SAME WAY

15:04.304 --> 15:06.573
THAT YOU'VE NEVER
FORGIVEN YOURSELF.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.241
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.509
ISN'T IT?

15:09.609 --> 15:11.444
YOU BLAMED YOURSELF
FOR TOMMY'S DEATH

15:11.544 --> 15:13.646
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS
THE ONE WHO JUMPED.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.483
YOU BLAMED YOURSELF
FOR JAMES

15:16.583 --> 15:19.452
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS
HELL-BENT ON DESTRUCTION.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.222
AND YOU BLAMED YOURSELF
FOR THIS CRISIS

15:22.322 --> 15:24.924
EVEN THOUGH YOU DID
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE

15:25.025 --> 15:26.926
- TO AVERT IT.
- IT WASN'T ENOUGH, PAUL.

15:27.027 --> 15:30.163
OF COURSE IT WASN'T.
I MEAN, HOW COULD IT BE?

15:30.263 --> 15:33.166
YOU'VE HAD BLOOD
ON YOUR HANDS,

15:33.266 --> 15:35.568
AS YOU SAY,
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.771
AND IT'S SHAPED
EVERYTHING.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.841
THAT'S WHY THIS TIME
WHEN KIDS DIED,

15:41.941 --> 15:45.478
IT WASN'T PUNISHMENT ENOUGH
TO SACRIFICE YOUR LIFE
TO YOUR PARENTS,

15:45.578 --> 15:48.781
AS YOU DID. THIS TIME
YOU HAD TO IMPOSE

15:48.881 --> 15:50.950
THE DEATH PENALTY
ON YOURSELF.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.961
- I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
- AND WHAT AM I DOING?

16:02.996 --> 16:06.933
IS THIS HOW YOU DEAL
WITH YOUR GUILT?

16:07.034 --> 16:09.436
YOU TELL YOURSELF THAT
WHAT YOU FEEL ISN'T REAL?

16:09.536 --> 16:13.173
THAT YOU DID
THE BEST YOU COULD?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.342
NO.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.510
IT'S ALWAYS THERE.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.147
I ALWAYS WONDER WHAT ELSE
I SHOULD HAVE DONE,

16:20.247 --> 16:22.182
WHAT THE LIMITS TRULY ARE

16:22.282 --> 16:24.651
OF RESPONSIBILITY
TO ANOTHER PERSON.

16:24.751 --> 16:28.055
AND YOU CAN LIVE WITH THAT?
IT DOESN'T AFFECT YOU?

16:28.155 --> 16:29.722
OF COURSE IT DOES.

16:29.822 --> 16:35.428
ALL I CAN REALLY DO
IS TRY TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED

16:35.528 --> 16:37.797
AND WHY I MADE
THE CHOICES I MADE.

16:37.897 --> 16:42.702
- TO LEARN FROM THE LOSS AND--
- WELL, IT'S DIFFERENT FOR YOU.

16:42.802 --> 16:47.207
YOU'RE A YOUNG MAN.
YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
YOUR MISTAKE--

16:47.307 --> 16:50.377
MOVE TO ANOTHER STATE,
START OVER.

16:50.477 --> 16:53.146
- AND YOU DON'T
FEEL THAT YOU CAN?
- IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.515
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.052
( chuckles )

16:59.152 --> 17:00.987
LOOK AT YOU--

17:01.088 --> 17:04.724
ONE EYE ON THE DOOR,
WONDERING WHEN YOU CAN
GET OUT OF HERE

17:04.824 --> 17:07.594
- AND CUT YOUR LOSSES.
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS DOING.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.231
NATALIE IS OUTSIDE.

17:11.331 --> 17:14.367
WHAT IS SHE STILL
DOING HERE?

17:14.467 --> 17:16.903
I TOLD HER TO GO HOME
TO HER MOTHER.

17:17.003 --> 17:21.608
- SHE DOESN'T
LISTEN TO ME ANYMORE.
- SHE'S ON WATCH, WALTER.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.644
SHE DOESN'T TRUST
THAT SOMEBODY IS

17:24.744 --> 17:27.480
GOING TO LOOK IN ON YOU
EVERY 15 MINUTES OR SO.

17:27.580 --> 17:31.184
EVERY 15 MINUTES?
IS THAT WHAT THAT IS?

17:32.552 --> 17:34.354
YOU'RE AT RISK.

17:35.988 --> 17:39.092
- DID YOU TELL HER THAT?
- SHE TOLD ME.

17:39.192 --> 17:42.429
SO?
TELL HER I'M FINE.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.832
"TELL HER I'M FINE."

17:47.267 --> 17:50.637
"YOU'RE SAFE TO FLY."
HMM.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.574
- WHATEVER.
- I CAN'T REALLY
DO THAT, WALTER.

17:54.674 --> 17:58.077
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO STAY HERE FOR
A LITTLE LONGER.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.313
BUT I'M FINE.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.415
I'M EATING.
I'M SLEEPING.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.084
I JUST GOT
A LITTLE DEHYDRATED.

18:05.185 --> 18:09.689
JUST TELL THEM YOU'RE
MY THERAPIST AND THAT THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.392
I CAN'T DO THAT.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.695
IN MY OPINION YOU NEED
TO BE KEPT UNDER OBSERVATION.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.097
AND YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR
THAT YOU DON'T WANT

18:18.198 --> 18:19.632
YOUR FAMILY
STANDING GUARD DUTY.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.668
ARE YOU TRYING
TO HAVE ME COMMITTED?

18:24.070 --> 18:27.407
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT I THINK
IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA

18:27.507 --> 18:29.742
FOR YOU TO STAY HERE
FOR A FEW DAYS.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.714
THIS HOSPITAL IS ONE
OF THE BEST IN THE CITY.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.417
I'LL CALL MY LAWYER.
HE'LL BOUNCE YOU ON YOUR ASS

18:37.517 --> 18:39.486
SO FAST YOU WON'T KNOW
WHAT HIT YOU.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.789
YOU WANT TO SUE ME, WALTER,
GET IN LINE.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.558
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA GET YOU
OUT OF HERE ANY SOONER.

18:54.267 --> 18:58.571
- HOW LONG?
- UNTIL IT'S SAFE
FOR YOU TO LEAVE.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.174
AND IF THE DOCTORS

19:01.274 --> 19:02.942
HAVEN'T RELEASED YOU
WITHIN TWO WEEKS,

19:03.042 --> 19:06.179
THEN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO MAKE YOUR CASE
BEFORE A JUDGE.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.748
A JUDGE?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:08.848 --> 19:11.451
I WISH I WERE.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.255
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO HAPPEN TO YOU, WALTER.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.695
TOO LATE.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.764
WALTER, IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

19:24.864 --> 19:28.568
- THERE'S A LOT--
- GET OUT OF HERE, WILL YOU?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.637
- ARE YOU SURE--
- JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.604
CAN I GO IN TO SEE HIM?

20:04.704 --> 20:07.807
UM, I'D-- I'D GIVE HIM
A FEW MINUTES.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.482
HE'S NOT COMING HOME
TOMORROW, IS HE?

20:16.516 --> 20:19.686
WELL, IT'S UP
TO THE DOCTORS, BUT...

20:19.786 --> 20:21.120
( clears throat )

20:21.220 --> 20:23.556
I'M GOING TO--
I'M GOING TO TELL THEM

20:23.656 --> 20:25.792
THAT HE'S STILL AT RISK
TO HIMSELF.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.829
HE DOESN'T AGREE,
OF COURSE,

20:29.929 --> 20:33.800
BUT I CAN'T TAKE
THE CHANCE.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.102
I KNOW.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.538
THANK YOU.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.544
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- ME?

20:44.644 --> 20:47.079
I'M FINE.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.181
I'M, UM--

20:49.282 --> 20:53.986
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT
WHAT I'M GOING TO TELL
MY MOTHER.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.789
I'M SORRY THIS IS...

20:56.889 --> 20:59.459
SO MUCH ON YOU.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.930
ACTUALLY I'M SURPRISED
THAT SHE'S NOT HERE TONIGHT.

21:04.030 --> 21:08.100
IT'S FOR THE BEST.
SHE IS NOT GREAT
IN THESE SITUATIONS

21:08.200 --> 21:09.936
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.939
WHY-- WHY IS THAT?

21:20.112 --> 21:22.782
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.320
OH, UM...

21:28.087 --> 21:29.922
SHE'S--

21:30.022 --> 21:33.326
SHE'S BEEN IN REHAB,
I DON'T KNOW, THREE,
FOUR TIMES.

21:33.426 --> 21:36.228
PILLS, BOOZE.

21:36.329 --> 21:39.366
SHE'S GONNA GO
TO PIECES.

21:57.183 --> 21:59.719
( theme music playing )
