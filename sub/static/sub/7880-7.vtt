<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>

00:35.971 --> 00:37.355
What are you so happy about?

00:37.578 --> 00:39.095
Just my life, I guess.

00:39.130 --> 00:41.998
It's pretty perfect, like these muffins.

00:42.033 --> 00:43.283
Try one.

00:43.334 --> 00:46.736
Oh, never drop a muffin in a fish bowl!

00:46.771 --> 00:48.238
Thanks
for that delicious summer salad,

00:48.272 --> 00:50.507
Susan, you've got
lipstick on your teeth.

00:50.541 --> 00:51.908
Next up, we're talking about

00:51.943 --> 00:55.095
our favorite subject here
on <i>Morning Glory:</i> holes!

00:55.129 --> 00:57.564
And today's hole comes
in the form of a well.

00:57.598 --> 01:01.401
The well that Baby Franny
fell into 35 years ago.

01:01.435 --> 01:03.303
And it turns out that that little girl

01:03.337 --> 01:06.206
who fell into that hole
and our homes and our hearts

01:06.240 --> 01:08.975
and our houses lives right here
in our very own Langley Falls.

01:09.010 --> 01:10.543
Yeah.

01:12.580 --> 01:15.282
Mom fell into a well?

01:15.316 --> 01:18.251
Wait, your mom was a baby?

01:18.286 --> 01:19.603
Oh!

01:19.637 --> 01:20.854
Mom, mom, mom!

01:20.888 --> 01:21.905
Come, come, come!

01:24.542 --> 01:27.377
What's all the fu...ss?

01:27.411 --> 01:29.980
Let's take a look back now, 35 years,

01:30.014 --> 01:31.548
to that spellbinding day...

01:31.582 --> 01:32.582
Ooh,

01:32.617 --> 01:34.935
spellbinding, yeah.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.020
Firefighter Henry Watkins has just

01:37.054 --> 01:38.838
descended into the collapsed well.

01:38.873 --> 01:41.942
Mom, I can't believe you didn't
tell us you were Baby Franny.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.843
It was no big deal.

01:43.878 --> 01:47.681
I am officially declaring this
the biggest deal in the world.

01:47.715 --> 01:49.816
I feel like we all feel--

01:49.850 --> 01:52.052
stuck in that well with her.

01:52.086 --> 01:55.755
It's cold and dark and I'm confused.

01:55.790 --> 01:58.224
Nancy, is it normal for a teenage girl

01:58.259 --> 02:00.293
like myself to be so disoriented?

02:00.328 --> 02:01.294
Hup!

02:01.329 --> 02:03.747
Hold on, something is now being

02:03.781 --> 02:05.565
pulled up from the well and...

02:05.599 --> 02:07.867
Whoa, whoa, I want to see if you live.

02:07.902 --> 02:09.985
Mom, how could you never
tell us about this?

02:10.020 --> 02:11.121
You're a big deal.

02:11.155 --> 02:13.139
No, I'm not a big deal!

02:13.174 --> 02:15.008
I just fell down a hole,

02:15.042 --> 02:18.211
no different from when you kids
fell out of my verjerj.

02:18.245 --> 02:22.098
Look, I just want to forget it, okay?

02:22.133 --> 02:23.933
Turn it back on.

02:23.968 --> 02:26.903
We'd love to have Baby
Franny on our little show,

02:26.937 --> 02:29.372
but she hasn't returned
our many phone calls.

02:29.407 --> 02:30.840
What a bitch.

02:30.875 --> 02:31.908
We're still on.

02:31.942 --> 02:34.978
Of a show we've got coming up!

02:35.012 --> 02:36.896
We got to get Mom on that show.

02:36.931 --> 02:38.365
They want to celebrate her.

02:38.399 --> 02:41.117
I don't know, she's still
upset about what happened.

02:41.152 --> 02:43.636
But maybe people celebrating her

02:43.671 --> 02:44.871
would help her get past it.

02:44.905 --> 02:46.606
Like how the cheers of
his fans helped Kobe

02:46.640 --> 02:48.641
get over that Denver incident.

02:52.363 --> 02:54.681
Thanks for a fun night, Graham.

02:54.715 --> 02:56.683
I know you're worried,
but there's really no way

02:56.717 --> 02:58.251
your wife could know about us.

03:01.789 --> 03:02.789
What'cha doing, fatso?

03:02.823 --> 03:04.474
I had to take a duke and I didn't want

03:04.508 --> 03:06.843
to wake Francine, so I came down here.

03:06.877 --> 03:09.145
God, naked men look so stupid in shoes.

03:11.382 --> 03:12.916
I do look pretty dumb.

03:12.950 --> 03:14.684
Women look hot wearing only shoes.

03:14.719 --> 03:17.620
Yeah, because they make
kick-ass female stripper shoes.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.155
Meanwhile, no one's making...

03:19.190 --> 03:21.458
Male stripper shoes.

03:21.492 --> 03:24.327
My eyes! Not again!

03:24.361 --> 03:25.328
Ow!

03:26.414 --> 03:27.414
Ow!

03:29.083 --> 03:31.117
So, Mom, this is the new waffle place

03:31.152 --> 03:32.585
we've been telling you about.

03:32.620 --> 03:33.920
This is a restaurant?

03:33.954 --> 03:36.790
I thought this was the news studio.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.679
What did you kids do?

03:42.713 --> 03:44.214
Everyone wanted to see you.

03:44.248 --> 03:45.799
You're a national treasure.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.401
No, look, you don't understand.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.036
And here
she is now--

03:50.071 --> 03:51.137
Baby Franny!

03:52.189 --> 03:53.757
Baby Franny!

03:53.791 --> 03:55.558
Baby Franny!

03:55.593 --> 03:57.393
Baby Franny!

03:57.428 --> 03:59.062
Baby Franny!

03:59.182 --> 04:00.818
Baby...
Shut up!

04:01.298 --> 04:02.966
Thank you.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.001
And thank you, Francine, for being here.

04:05.035 --> 04:07.270
Francine, as you know, next week is the

04:07.304 --> 04:09.906
35th anniversary of the "hole" thing.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.109
And your hometown of Grundy is planning

04:13.144 --> 04:15.779
a huge celebration to honor you.

04:15.813 --> 04:17.046
They are?

04:17.081 --> 04:19.949
Yes, but first, we all
remember that brave hero

04:19.983 --> 04:23.736
Henry Watkins, who died--
aw-- while saving Baby Franny.

04:23.771 --> 04:27.257
Somebody died to save Mom?

04:27.291 --> 04:29.659
Well, Henry Watkins might have died,

04:29.693 --> 04:31.494
but his wife and son didn't.

04:31.529 --> 04:32.996
Daughter killed herself.

04:33.030 --> 04:36.733
Let's give a big <i>Morning</i>
<i>Glory</i> hole-hearted welcome

04:36.767 --> 04:38.601
to Margaret and Henry Jr.!

04:42.907 --> 04:46.442
Oh, look at you, all grown up.

04:46.477 --> 04:48.645
Henry would have loved
to see you like this,

04:48.679 --> 04:51.281
with your great adult body.

04:51.315 --> 04:54.284
He loved adult women with great bodies.

04:54.318 --> 04:56.152
Aw...

04:56.187 --> 04:57.954
Tell us, Henry Jr.,

04:57.988 --> 04:59.988
what have you been doing
with yourself since the...

04:59.990 --> 05:01.891
well, incident?

05:01.926 --> 05:02.992
Well incident.

05:06.497 --> 05:07.664
Well...

05:07.698 --> 05:09.666
Well, there it is again.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.334
Well... what?

05:11.368 --> 05:13.236
Wel-- um...

05:13.270 --> 05:15.271
I've been trying my hardest

05:15.306 --> 05:17.440
to make my dead dad proud, you know.

05:17.474 --> 05:19.175
I'm an astronaut and I'm helping

05:19.210 --> 05:21.211
build a space station on the moon.

05:23.113 --> 05:25.081
But enough about me.

05:25.115 --> 05:27.050
I can't wait to hear
what Francine's done

05:27.084 --> 05:28.852
with the gift my father gave her,

05:28.886 --> 05:32.789
the gift of life.

05:34.258 --> 05:37.126
Francine.
Tell us.

05:37.161 --> 05:38.461
What... did...

05:38.495 --> 05:39.696
you... do...

05:39.730 --> 05:40.930
with... your...

05:40.965 --> 05:44.300
gift... of... life?

05:46.203 --> 05:52.625
Oh...

05:58.165 --> 06:00.800
I want to tell everyone

06:00.834 --> 06:03.703
all the great things
I've done with my life.

06:03.737 --> 06:06.406
Um... um...

06:06.440 --> 06:07.640
Um-um-um-um-um-um-um.

06:07.675 --> 06:11.277
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop.

06:15.082 --> 06:17.717
Oh, my God, she's having
a nervous breakdown.

06:20.921 --> 06:24.591
What my mom's trying to say
is that she'll tell everyone

06:24.625 --> 06:26.159
what she's done with her life,

06:26.193 --> 06:28.261
uh, next week at the big event.

06:28.295 --> 06:29.495
Thank you!

06:29.530 --> 06:33.316
When we come back,
local strongman Brian Lewis.

06:34.729 --> 06:35.638
Aah!

06:35.758 --> 06:38.404
My strength comes from above!

06:44.925 --> 06:47.160
Do you know how guilty I feel,

06:47.194 --> 06:49.861
knowing that firefighter died

06:49.981 --> 06:52.298
so I could live?

06:52.333 --> 06:55.348
And now next week
I'm supposed to tell everyone

06:55.467 --> 06:57.435
what I did with that life?

06:57.469 --> 06:59.570
I've done nothing with my life!

06:59.605 --> 07:00.805
Kill yourself.

07:00.839 --> 07:02.273
Do it.

07:02.307 --> 07:03.775
Shut up, Klaus.

07:03.809 --> 07:05.543
You've done stuff with your life.

07:05.577 --> 07:07.095
You made me, Mommy.

07:07.129 --> 07:09.363
Any dumbass can have dumbass kids.

07:09.398 --> 07:10.882
Mama, no.

07:10.916 --> 07:13.267
Come on, Mom, you raised a great family.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.269
Says my brain surgeon daughter.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.971
Come on, Jeff, she's got Chablis mouth.

07:18.707 --> 07:21.142
Next week I'll have
to admit to the world

07:21.176 --> 07:23.978
that I've done nothing
the past 35 years.

07:24.012 --> 07:25.847
Well, there is still a week.

07:25.881 --> 07:27.515
What could I do in a week?

07:27.566 --> 07:30.067
You could... write a
Rob Schneider movie.

07:30.102 --> 07:31.502
You could kill someone famous.

07:31.537 --> 07:33.037
That worked for Courtney Love.

07:33.071 --> 07:35.106
Or I could make male stripper shoes.

07:35.140 --> 07:36.440
No one's done that yet.

07:36.475 --> 07:38.876
Dumb idea. Don't do it.
Move on. Say something else.

07:38.911 --> 07:41.295
He's right, it is a dumb idea.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.464
Oh, this is useless.

07:43.499 --> 07:45.666
We've been talking for almost a minute

07:45.701 --> 07:48.169
and come up with zero good ideas.

07:48.203 --> 07:51.572
At this rate, we'll have
zero good ideas every hour.

07:51.607 --> 07:52.607
Hey...

07:52.641 --> 07:54.175
that's actually good math.

07:54.209 --> 07:56.144
How'd you get so good at math?

07:56.178 --> 07:58.379
Oh, I've been tinkering
with this fun app

07:58.413 --> 08:00.381
on my phone
called "calculator."

08:00.415 --> 08:01.849
That's it!

08:01.884 --> 08:03.451
Mom, in school we learned there's

08:03.485 --> 08:05.353
seven unsolved math problems.

08:05.387 --> 08:08.189
If you solve one you win
the Millennium Math Prize:

08:08.223 --> 08:10.825
a million dollars and
worldwide recognition.

08:10.859 --> 08:12.193
I don't know.

08:12.227 --> 08:14.996
You actually think I could solve one?

08:15.030 --> 08:16.831
Yes.
Okay.

08:20.169 --> 08:22.069
I'm telling you, Stan,
Giuseppe's the guy

08:22.104 --> 08:23.671
to make our male stripper shoes.

08:23.705 --> 08:25.773
Eh, <i>grazie!</i>

08:25.807 --> 08:27.775
Yay, Boboli!

08:27.809 --> 08:29.777
Hmm...

08:29.811 --> 08:31.579
Mm-hmm...

08:31.613 --> 08:32.580
Look at this,

08:32.614 --> 08:34.015
what a cool biplane.

08:34.049 --> 08:35.515
Giuseppe, did you draw this?

08:35.551 --> 08:36.717
<i>Si, si...</i>

08:36.751 --> 08:37.985
Trace.
I-I trace.

08:38.020 --> 08:38.986
What?

08:39.020 --> 08:40.755
I traced it.

08:40.789 --> 08:42.023
Hold on, this one's not bad.

08:42.057 --> 08:44.492
Not bad at all.

08:44.526 --> 08:46.427
What if we make the soles slanted

08:46.461 --> 08:47.562
to get guys bowlegged,

08:47.596 --> 08:48.796
really open up the "D" area?

08:48.830 --> 08:49.814
Right, right.

08:49.848 --> 08:51.582
Almost push the Bs out front.

08:51.617 --> 08:53.834
Of course we'll need to raise
some money for the prototype.

08:53.869 --> 08:56.204
You know, Toshi's father
is a venture capitalist.

08:56.238 --> 08:57.538
I'll set up a meeting.

08:57.573 --> 08:59.290
Perfect.
The Japanese love me.

08:59.324 --> 09:01.559
You know, I was a huge TV star there.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:11.270 --> 09:14.355
So, after reviewing the
seven unsolved math problems,

09:14.389 --> 09:17.325
I chose the Yang-Mills
Existence and Mass Gap.

09:17.359 --> 09:19.227
I don't think I can do this.

09:19.261 --> 09:20.795
Yes, you can.
Okay.

10:17.653 --> 10:19.070
Six.

10:19.104 --> 10:21.605
Uh, what's that?

10:21.640 --> 10:23.107
Oh, that?

10:23.141 --> 10:25.843
It's the answer to the
Mang-Yills Existence

10:25.877 --> 10:28.479
and Mass Gap problem, nerds.

10:28.513 --> 10:30.881
Uh, the answer won't be a number.

10:30.916 --> 10:33.150
It'll be a new concept
in math altogether.

10:33.185 --> 10:34.585
So...

10:34.619 --> 10:35.853
You failed!

10:35.887 --> 10:37.154
Matthew!

10:38.607 --> 10:40.324
Matthew.

10:40.359 --> 10:42.093
Matthew...

10:42.127 --> 10:44.895
Matthew.

10:44.930 --> 10:46.414
Matthew!

10:47.666 --> 10:48.632
Ma...

10:48.667 --> 10:50.568
Matthew.

10:50.602 --> 10:53.204
M-Matthew!

10:53.238 --> 10:55.940
Matth... Matthew!

10:55.974 --> 10:57.942
Ma...

10:57.976 --> 10:59.810
Matthew...

10:59.845 --> 11:01.545
Matthew!

11:01.580 --> 11:03.447
Math... you...

11:03.482 --> 11:08.052
can... under... stand...
is... what... I... teach

11:08.086 --> 11:09.286
in this class.

11:15.961 --> 11:17.445
The event's tomorrow.

11:17.479 --> 11:18.996
What am I going to do?

11:19.030 --> 11:20.531
Falling into that well

11:20.549 --> 11:25.469
was the only exceptional
thing I ever did.

11:25.504 --> 11:29.056
Ain't never done
nothing good for nobody.

11:29.091 --> 11:31.425
Yeah, but maybe you gonna do dem

11:31.476 --> 11:35.262
good deeds on down da road for somebod'.

11:35.313 --> 11:37.815
Are you Tara Reid?

11:40.352 --> 11:43.220
The fact that male stripper
shoes don't already exist

11:43.255 --> 11:44.655
is unbelievable to me.

11:44.689 --> 11:46.930
Roger and I were just talking
about this on the way over.

11:46.942 --> 11:48.426
What d I say, Roger,
on the way over--

11:48.460 --> 11:49.744
w-w-w-what did
I say to you?

11:49.778 --> 11:51.479
I-I don't know
what you're doing.

11:51.513 --> 11:52.713
We didn't drive here together.

11:52.748 --> 11:55.683
I came straight from physical therapy.

11:55.717 --> 11:59.086
Well, these sketches are just fantastic.

11:59.121 --> 12:01.689
You boys have really
got your act together.

12:01.723 --> 12:05.159
How do we feel about $30,000?

12:09.531 --> 12:13.000
Oh, but you only get
the money on one condition.

12:13.034 --> 12:15.169
You invite me to all the parties!

12:19.191 --> 12:21.308
And I'll need you to kill my wife.

12:22.911 --> 12:24.979
This is an untraceable gun.

12:25.013 --> 12:26.981
The business world is ruthless.

12:27.015 --> 12:30.284
I need to know
you guys have what it takes.

12:30.318 --> 12:34.271
Kill Hiko, and you'll get your money.

12:34.306 --> 12:37.341
Is this like an undercover police setup?

12:37.375 --> 12:39.543
Because if it is, I won't do it.

12:39.578 --> 12:42.379
But if it isn't, I'll totally do it.

12:42.414 --> 12:45.549
Repeat, will do.

12:47.285 --> 12:48.519
We're live at the 35th

12:48.553 --> 12:50.421
anniversary of Baby Franny's rescue.

12:50.455 --> 12:53.524
Oh, and it appears that Baby
Franny herself has just arrived.

12:53.558 --> 12:55.626
All right, its her!

13:03.285 --> 13:08.222
Adult Baby Franny, 35 years
ago, fireman Henry Watkins

13:08.256 --> 13:10.024
died so you could live.

13:10.058 --> 13:12.460
What have you done with that life?

13:12.494 --> 13:17.631
Well, I... um...

13:26.791 --> 13:29.293
Hey, careful now!

13:29.327 --> 13:31.195
If you fall down that
well, you won't be able

13:31.229 --> 13:32.496
to answer all our questions!

13:34.032 --> 13:38.736
Oh, no, my lifelong tripping problem!

13:39.988 --> 13:41.155
Oh, no!

13:41.189 --> 13:44.391
<i>Whew! Dodged that bullet.</i>

13:44.442 --> 13:47.878
<i>Everything's gonna be just fine.</i>

13:47.913 --> 13:50.431
Oh!

13:59.641 --> 14:02.109
Henry? Is that you?

14:02.143 --> 14:04.144
Hi.

14:07.131 --> 14:09.648
Henry, I can't believe you're alive!

14:09.768 --> 14:14.644
Baby Franny?
Your boobs got so crazy!

14:14.764 --> 14:17.732
Oh, my God, this is so great!

14:17.767 --> 14:18.967
You're alive!

14:19.001 --> 14:20.802
Now I don't have to explain what I've

14:20.836 --> 14:22.153
done with my life!

14:22.188 --> 14:25.023
Help!
We're down here!

14:25.057 --> 14:27.575
Wait, wait.
I don't want to go back up.

14:27.610 --> 14:29.577
My whole life is down here.

14:29.612 --> 14:32.514
As you can see,
I'm quite the ladies' man.

14:35.851 --> 14:41.206
Henry, please, I need you
to come back up.

14:45.244 --> 14:46.811
Keep pulling! Keep pulling!

14:48.547 --> 14:51.599
Turns out I don't have to
explain what I did with my life

14:51.634 --> 14:54.269
because no one died for me.

14:54.303 --> 14:58.173
That's right, Henry Watkins is alive!

14:59.892 --> 15:01.342
What is that?

15:07.216 --> 15:08.833
It's okay, Henry.

15:08.868 --> 15:12.337
Look, it's your family!

15:13.539 --> 15:15.957
Oh, Margaret...

15:15.991 --> 15:18.376
Henry!

15:21.030 --> 15:22.413
Wait, come back!

15:22.431 --> 15:24.849
He just needs some time to readjust!

15:24.884 --> 15:27.385
No! I've become
a monster!

15:27.419 --> 15:29.888
I'm going back in the well
where I belong.

15:29.922 --> 15:32.357
No, no, no, no, no, no, you can't!

15:32.391 --> 15:36.361
If you go back in that well,
it's like you did die for me.

15:36.395 --> 15:39.397
I swear you can be normal again.

15:39.431 --> 15:40.999
I'll help you.

15:41.033 --> 15:43.368
Oh, Francine,

15:43.402 --> 15:45.970
how can I ever thank you?

15:54.663 --> 15:57.432
Not like that, Henry.

15:57.466 --> 15:59.167
Not like that.

16:02.746 --> 16:03.872
Right there.

16:03.906 --> 16:05.306
Try to shoot her somewhere

16:05.341 --> 16:06.662
between right here and right here.

16:07.780 --> 16:10.061
And right here, that's the pot I want.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.496
The four-quart
Le Crueset.

16:11.530 --> 16:14.199
I'll have it forever
and use it for everything.

16:15.401 --> 16:17.410
We can't kill her, Roger.

16:17.530 --> 16:20.522
Not for male stripper shoes.

16:20.573 --> 16:22.290
Well, can we kill her for the pot?!

16:22.324 --> 16:24.192
'Cause it's like
a hundred-dollar pot!

16:24.226 --> 16:26.361
Stan!

16:26.395 --> 16:28.296
Okay, Henry.

16:28.330 --> 16:32.233
The first step to a normal life
is getting you cleaned up.

16:35.905 --> 16:39.741
Oh, that's a great choice, Henry.

16:39.775 --> 16:41.276
You don't think it's too wild?

16:41.310 --> 16:45.930
You're gonna look great.

16:45.965 --> 16:47.065
Henry, no!

16:48.167 --> 16:49.417
Ooh.

17:03.682 --> 17:08.169
Klaus, have you met my gorgeous
friend Willem Dafoe?

17:08.203 --> 17:10.771
I'm kidding, it's Henry!

17:10.806 --> 17:14.742
Wow, really cool place.

17:14.777 --> 17:17.412
And is this your beautiful family?

17:17.445 --> 17:21.965
And who's this little
guy, little heartbreaker?

17:22.001 --> 17:24.636
Um...

17:24.670 --> 17:27.538
You must be exhausted.

17:27.573 --> 17:29.107
Why don't we turn in?

17:29.141 --> 17:31.509
And tomorrow we'll go job hunting.

17:31.543 --> 17:34.512
Well, let's just hope that
they can't hear my thoughts.

17:38.484 --> 17:40.084
You mad at me?

17:40.119 --> 17:41.385
No...

17:41.403 --> 17:43.171
Neither one of us
could pull the trigger.

17:43.205 --> 17:44.322
What are we gonna do?

17:44.356 --> 17:46.457
We have this great idea and...
Roger!

17:46.492 --> 17:50.461
"Introducing the world's
first male stripper shoes"?

18:00.889 --> 18:02.724
Hey, we invented those shoes!

18:02.758 --> 18:04.659
No, you didn't. He did.

18:04.693 --> 18:07.178
What the hell, Hideki?!

18:07.212 --> 18:10.581
I told you the business world
was ruthless.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.003
You son of a bitch!

18:15.037 --> 18:16.270
It's okay, Big Bruce.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.806
These are my unsavvy business friends.

18:18.841 --> 18:22.176
Oh, come on, let me at least
buy you boys a dance.

18:22.211 --> 18:23.978
Big Rodriguez, Throb Lowe,

18:24.947 --> 18:26.731
a dance for me and my friends!

18:29.935 --> 18:33.504
You idiot, you used the biplane
sketch for the prototype?!

18:33.539 --> 18:35.173
He just traced that for fun!

18:35.207 --> 18:36.774
Oh, really?

18:36.809 --> 18:40.678
Gentlemen, you are clear
for take-it-off.

18:47.970 --> 18:51.222
Oh, my God! He did it, Stan!

18:51.256 --> 18:54.108
Brevo, Hideki! Brevo!

18:58.297 --> 19:00.198
Oh, no, oh, no!

19:02.317 --> 19:04.435
Henry, no!

19:04.469 --> 19:05.620
Help!

19:05.654 --> 19:06.721
What's going on?!

19:06.755 --> 19:08.790
What do you think is going on?!

19:08.824 --> 19:11.376
I told you I shouldn't be up here!

19:15.514 --> 19:17.365
Henry, wait!

19:18.751 --> 19:21.619
No, Henry, come back!

19:23.989 --> 19:26.240
You can be normal again!

19:33.932 --> 19:35.683
Oh, no, Henry, don't!

19:35.718 --> 19:37.285
Don't go back!

19:37.319 --> 19:39.821
I can't keep living
with the guilt of knowing

19:39.855 --> 19:41.556
you gave up your life for me!

19:41.590 --> 19:43.291
Gave up my life?

19:43.325 --> 19:46.227
No, it was my choice to save you.

19:46.261 --> 19:48.980
But I've done nothing great
with the life you've saved.

19:49.014 --> 19:52.583
Why do you have to do something
great? You're happy.

19:52.618 --> 19:55.186
That's all I ever wanted for you.

19:55.220 --> 19:57.188
Boobs and happiness.

19:57.222 --> 19:59.490
And you got 'em both in spades.

19:59.525 --> 20:03.060
So don't be great, just be Francine.

20:03.095 --> 20:06.130
Normal, crappy Francine.

20:07.633 --> 20:11.402
I just wish there was some way
I could pay you back.

20:11.437 --> 20:17.074
The only thing you can do for me
is to just keep being you, babe.

20:17.109 --> 20:18.976
And maybe, like, every now and then,

20:19.011 --> 20:21.379
drop a picture of them
creamy boobs down the well?

20:21.413 --> 20:24.449
Really?
Yeah. Really.

20:24.483 --> 20:26.651
Um... okay.

20:33.859 --> 20:37.495
Thank you, Henry Watkins.

20:42.868 --> 20:45.453
<i>And Francine made good</i>
<i>on her promise,</i>

20:45.504 --> 20:48.303
<i>dropping down a tasteful</i>

20:48.423 --> 20:51.292
<i>cans, each and every week</i>

20:51.343 --> 20:54.176
