00:18.852 --> 00:20.717
It's alive!

00:43.643 --> 00:44.769
Can I play?

00:44.811 --> 00:48.076
Will you go to hell,
you piece of garbage?!

01:04.897 --> 01:06.923
Bueno. Bueno.

01:06.966 --> 01:08.456
Perfecto!

01:08.501 --> 01:10.628
Grande. Grande.

01:10.670 --> 01:14.333
El Presidente, tenemos
una situation muy serioso.

01:14.374 --> 01:16.467
Un hombre is scoring very high...

01:16.509 --> 01:18.477
en el Dance Dance Revolucion.

01:18.511 --> 01:19.773
Dios mio.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.781
Bueno. Perfecto.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.010
Silencio.

01:24.050 --> 01:26.348
I challenge your revolution...

01:26.386 --> 01:30.049
con una Dance Dance
Counter-Revolution!

01:31.991 --> 01:34.221
Let's do 321 Boom: Mega Remix...

01:34.260 --> 01:37.627
by D J Sassytown,
featuring Lady Godiva.

01:43.002 --> 01:45.732
Bueno. Bueno.

01:46.406 --> 01:49.500
Bueno. Perfecto.
Perfecto.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.602
Malo. Malo.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.909
No es bueno.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.415
Malo. No es bueno.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.010
Anti-bueno.

02:11.898 --> 02:14.799
Tu esta banda pudu.

02:15.668 --> 02:17.932
This is for my Cuban people.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.388
Sí!

02:41.427 --> 02:45.523
Yo soy the best dancer dancer
in el mundo.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.959
I have quelled your revolution...

02:49.002 --> 02:51.334
but I must say,
your bravery is inspiring.

02:51.371 --> 02:56.001
I honor and respect
your courage and conviction.

02:56.042 --> 02:58.704
I love doing that.

02:58.745 --> 03:03.148
Presidente, una señora es beating
your high score on Dig Dug.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.583
Get me some tokens.

03:06.152 --> 03:10.782
I don't know.
Maybe if we used some toys?

03:10.823 --> 03:13.656
Yeah. Gonna finish the job.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.661
I'm about to tame that ass.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.242
I must've lost him.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.507
You know, since I'm out,
I might as well pick up some milk.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.349
Wait a second.
I have milk at home.

03:45.091 --> 03:47.355
¤ Let's have some milk ¤

03:47.393 --> 03:49.486
¤ Milk is good ¤

03:49.529 --> 03:51.156
¤ Going home to have some milk ¤

03:51.197 --> 03:53.290
¤ Gonna drink milk
have sweet dreams ¤

03:53.333 --> 03:56.530
I'm sorry my powers
screwed your life up again, master.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.934
I'll see you tomorrow.

04:03.509 --> 04:04.567
Master!

04:04.611 --> 04:07.876
And I want to thank my coach,
who pushed me hard...

04:07.914 --> 04:11.441
and my parents and Satan. Satan!

04:12.485 --> 04:15.318
And my grandma,
who couldn't be here today.

04:17.757 --> 04:23.525
So what's it gonna be, Derek,
the minivan or the sports car?

04:24.931 --> 04:27.764
Nice choice.

04:46.686 --> 04:49.678
- Spare some change?
- I'm a veteran.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.690
I'll clean your windows for a dollar.

04:51.724 --> 04:54.454
Hey, boogie boogie,
my brain is an antelope.

04:54.494 --> 04:55.620
Have some mustard...

04:55.662 --> 04:58.529
because it's Easter in your face.
My toenails!

04:58.564 --> 05:02.000
The test results are in.
It's rectal cancer.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.936
So should we go with chemo
or holistic medicine?

05:09.942 --> 05:13.309
- Best friends forever.
- Forever.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.844
My balls!
What happened to my balls?

05:21.888 --> 05:24.584
Why would someone
do this to my balls?

05:24.624 --> 05:27.457
This show is so clever.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.758
- It just happened so fast.
- All right. Now just take it easy.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.856
This is the worst day of my life.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.401
...all thanks
to stem cell research.

06:16.776 --> 06:19.802
So, Miss Lohan,
it's 12 million plus gross points.

06:19.846 --> 06:22.178
- Sign on the dotted line.
- Hold on a second.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.150
I have some requemps.
I want a big trailer...

06:25.184 --> 06:28.779
and I want a trailer in my trailer...

06:28.821 --> 06:32.723
and my dog needs an assistant dog.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.823
I assure you that all of your...

06:36.863 --> 06:39.696
- Miss Lohan?
- Lindsay? Pumpkin?

06:39.732 --> 06:43.259
Can you make that check out to Cash?
That's my nickname for her.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.971
Can I get you anything, miss Lohan?

06:47.006 --> 06:50.840
Diet Sprite, Squirt, Coca-Cola?

06:54.046 --> 06:57.709
- Lindsay Lohan.
- Amanda Bynes.

07:07.126 --> 07:09.253
Just let me know
if you need anything.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.355
It totally can't end like this.

07:13.399 --> 07:14.923
My new album drops tomorrow.

07:14.967 --> 07:18.801
Looks like you'll be selling
them posthumorous.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.272
Posthum... Posthummus.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.798
There can be only one.

07:30.983 --> 07:34.077
Does this power make me look fat?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.350
Not a problem.
We'll blame it on her father.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.378
Works for me.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.629
In case you haven't realized it by now...

07:44.664 --> 07:46.495
this is a Highlander parody.

07:46.532 --> 07:48.557
When I grow up, I'm gonna get an Oscar.

07:48.601 --> 07:51.570
If by Oscar you mean
"get your head cut off... "

07:51.604 --> 07:54.368
you're on your way
if you don't train harder.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.534
That totally isn't what I meant, stupid.

07:56.576 --> 07:59.170
You smell like whiskey,
and I want to go shopping.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.840
And they complain
when I smack my wife.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.406
You must harness
your gifts for the gathering.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.179
What gathering? You're gathering.

08:06.219 --> 08:10.053
All the teen starlets
will feel the urge to fight for the prize.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.286
In the end, there can be only one.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.056
What prize?
As in Oscar?

08:16.095 --> 08:18.427
I'm gonna win one
because I'm Lindsay Lohan.

08:18.464 --> 08:21.763
Lo-han. Lohan. I'm not slurring.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.473
Never lose your temper.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.908
- Never lose my tampa?
- Temper.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.876
I hate your slurring, you drunk.

08:32.912 --> 08:36.245
I'm not drunk. I'm Scottish.

08:36.282 --> 08:39.581
Sure, and I was
in the hospital for exhaustion.

08:40.553 --> 08:43.716
Touché.
Now you're ready.

08:43.756 --> 08:44.780
Good.

08:44.824 --> 08:47.088
You got me in the pounder plums.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.295
Colder than a witch's tit tonight.

08:53.332 --> 08:56.768
- Better heat up the sauce.
- Where's Lohan?

08:56.802 --> 09:01.364
You're too late, Hillary Duff.
I've already prepared her for you.

09:01.407 --> 09:04.706
- You've wasted your time.
- My alcohol!

09:05.711 --> 09:09.306
- There can be only one.
- Wait!

09:12.919 --> 09:13.908
OK.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.421
You're next, Lindsay.

09:16.455 --> 09:20.516
I lost 150 pounds,
and nobody takes me seriously.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.926
Maybe I'll adopt a brown kid. What?

09:23.963 --> 09:27.455
He's dead, as are the Olsen twins.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.300
I even decapitated my sister Haylie,
though she didn't have powers...

09:31.337 --> 09:33.805
and that was awkward
to explain to mom and dad.

09:33.839 --> 09:38.208
- Only you and I remain.
- You bitch!

09:38.244 --> 09:41.372
Watch it, Lohan.
We can't fight on holy ground.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.712
You know where to find me, Duff.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.547
So now it ends.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.579
- The power is mine, Lohan.
- Not if I can help it.

09:50.623 --> 09:51.885
- Slut!
- Whore!

09:51.924 --> 09:55.121
- White trash!
- "Agent Cody" skank.

09:55.161 --> 09:57.026
Aaron Carter loves me.

09:57.063 --> 10:00.123
Aaron said your toes were gross.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.567
- Your album sucks!
- My album sucks!

10:03.603 --> 10:07.334
There can be only one.

10:12.378 --> 10:15.472
I know. I know everything.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.812
I am everything.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.408
I have the power.

10:21.320 --> 10:26.417
You have done well.
Use your powers wisely, my child.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.517
I will.

10:29.328 --> 10:33.924
Unlimited power!

10:35.935 --> 10:39.029
Is this really how Highlander ended?
