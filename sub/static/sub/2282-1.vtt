04:12.501 --> 04:21.934
And all I have to do today

04:22.833 --> 04:32.267
Is get past remembering...

04:36.667 --> 04:38.108
Maybe.

04:39.967 --> 04:42.110
Just this once.

04:43.733 --> 04:47.370
Let me think about
it a little bit. Okay?

05:17.234 --> 05:20.177
Hi, Tina.

05:23.733 --> 05:25.609
Something happened?

05:25.733 --> 05:28.472
No. I just didn't want
to come this year.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.970
'Cause it's her thirteenth birthday.

05:39.134 --> 05:40.940
I guess.

05:41.334 --> 05:43.004
I understand.

05:53.601 --> 05:57.169
I hate living in that house alone.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.102
I miss Matthew.

06:10.567 --> 06:12.737
I miss Cassandra.

06:17.733 --> 06:19.733
I miss living.

07:19.167 --> 07:20.866
Going into town?

07:20.867 --> 07:22.003
Yeah.

07:22.334 --> 07:24.004
All right.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.300
- It's cold out there, huh?
- Sure is.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.493
- I'm Matt.
- Page.

07:36.593 --> 07:37.831
- What's your name?
- Page.

07:37.932 --> 07:41.109
Page. Nice to meet you, Page.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.109
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

09:13.466 --> 09:14.766
Hi.

09:14.767 --> 09:16.903
Hey. What's up?

09:17.434 --> 09:18.910
Not much.

09:19.334 --> 09:21.004
Planning on going?

09:21.134 --> 09:22.940
Well, aren't you?

09:23.033 --> 09:25.601
She said she wanted to
meet with both of us.

09:27.666 --> 09:32.235
Well, it is... it's dumping up here.
How is it down there?

09:33.867 --> 09:36.032
No, it's fine. It's clear.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.567
There's no way that I'm
going to get down there.

09:39.234 --> 09:41.836
It's okay. You always
have excuses, Matthew.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.936
Yeah.

09:47.401 --> 09:48.699
Do you remember that brush
that she used to love?

09:48.700 --> 09:51.371
- The one that my mum gave her?
- Yeah.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.609
Well, I just found one.

09:54.367 --> 09:55.966
It... it's almost the same.

09:55.967 --> 09:57.240
Where?

09:57.433 --> 09:58.832
One of the rooms.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.867
Someone must have left it.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.636
That's weird.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.041
Yeah, it's weird.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.234
I should get back to work.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.072
Okay. I love you.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.037
Love you.

10:41.267 --> 10:42.565
I really feel like...

10:42.566 --> 10:45.532
I have been cracking the
whip here on them, okay.

10:45.533 --> 10:48.632
But if there is any chance of
us finishing this on time, I...

10:48.633 --> 10:52.339
You will. Which you will 'cause it's
your job to make sure we finish on time.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.519
I mean,

10:54.520 --> 10:58.199
how old were you when you first
started working for me as a welder,

10:58.200 --> 10:59.665
how old were you?

10:59.666 --> 11:01.333
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.

11:01.334 --> 11:04.811
And in all those years did I
ever treat you like a friend?

11:05.733 --> 11:07.365
Never!

11:07.366 --> 11:11.166
Now I might have treated you like a son,
but I never treated you like a friend.

11:11.167 --> 11:13.966
That's the problem here, Mika.
You're treating all these guys

11:13.967 --> 11:17.808
like they're your buddies
and they're not.

11:20.633 --> 11:22.610
They're tradesmen.

11:24.067 --> 11:27.669
They're working for you.
They're not your friend.

11:33.666 --> 11:35.166
Hey there.

11:35.733 --> 11:37.665
This is a... this is a
beautiful development.

11:37.666 --> 11:40.332
We... we sold out the first
phase in a couple of days.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.266
And you jump in now you can have
your place on the ninth hole.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.233
Vince Grey.

11:44.234 --> 11:47.968
Detective Cornwall. Hi. I'd like to...

11:48.466 --> 11:51.375
I'd like to ask you some questions
about your charity ball.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.941
Still no word?

11:57.833 --> 12:01.833
Well, I... I gave a statement
to one of your colleagues and...

12:01.967 --> 12:04.932
Listen, we can do this here or
we can go down to the station.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.671
Wherever you want.

12:06.733 --> 12:09.733
Hey, okay. Sure. Sit down.

12:10.867 --> 12:13.866
The woman that offered Detective
Dunlop a ride, had you seen her before?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.901
- No.
- You'd never seen her?

12:16.633 --> 12:18.110
No.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.973
I had not. How do you know that...

12:21.633 --> 12:26.543
Detective Dunlop's disappearance
is connected to this woman?

12:27.100 --> 12:29.406
Did... did I say it was?

12:30.167 --> 12:33.769
Look, I've... I've already
made a statement.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.443
- I've already talked to a detective.
- Right.

12:38.234 --> 12:41.734
I mean, I... I really, I don't know
how I can help you more than that.

12:43.234 --> 12:46.143
Your wife is on the board
of this charity, correct?

12:48.200 --> 12:51.041
- Yeah.
- Well, I'd like to speak to her, if I can.

12:51.299 --> 12:52.699
Well, be my guest.

12:52.700 --> 12:55.973
Well, she won't return any of my
phone calls. I've tried many times.

12:57.299 --> 13:00.209
- I'll make sure that she does.
- Good. Thank you.

13:00.233 --> 13:01.802
One more thing.

13:02.167 --> 13:05.499
A guest reported seeing the two
of you having a conversation.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.409
- What was that about?
- I made a comment

13:08.733 --> 13:11.499
to her about how different she looked...

13:11.500 --> 13:14.603
that night from how she
appears in this picture.

13:17.566 --> 13:19.634
Is that why you kept it?

13:20.233 --> 13:23.066
You were seen having a
conversation in front of it.

13:23.067 --> 13:24.737
Before she went missing.

13:24.867 --> 13:26.469
Why don't you take it?

13:30.233 --> 13:31.836
Take 'em both.

13:44.134 --> 13:47.873
Is there any hope of the two
of you getting back together?

13:48.400 --> 13:52.241
We talk. He calls, you know,
all the time.

13:54.933 --> 13:57.239
It's like one big talk.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.705
Talks me to sleep sometimes.

14:05.199 --> 14:07.677
But he's scared to show his face.

14:08.433 --> 14:09.774
Why?

14:10.100 --> 14:11.838
'Cause he's guilty.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.572
Because it's his fault.

14:14.833 --> 14:17.004
This whole thing is his fault.

14:20.566 --> 14:23.044
You know, I want him to feel guilty.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.443
It makes sense.

14:32.933 --> 14:34.876
Nothing else does.

14:47.067 --> 14:48.908
That cowboy?

14:49.366 --> 14:50.775
Yeah.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.902
Come on in.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.532
Thank you.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.011
- Detective Jeffrey Cornwall.
- Hi.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.735
Yeah, Jeff.

15:09.767 --> 15:12.732
You have an impressive
clearance rate, Detective Cornwall.

15:12.733 --> 15:14.107
Thank you.

15:15.900 --> 15:19.966
Why would you walk away from a great
career in homicide to join my unit?

15:19.967 --> 15:22.637
Well, I figure it's pretty
much the same skill set.

15:23.067 --> 15:25.601
Except here I get to deal
with living victims,

15:26.166 --> 15:29.098
- for a change.
- What is your history with children?

15:29.099 --> 15:31.440
Well, I was one, once.

15:35.266 --> 15:37.801
Have you ever felt attracted to them?

15:38.666 --> 15:39.999
No.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.602
Do you have a fantasy life?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.340
What does your fantasy life involve?

15:50.066 --> 15:51.669
Adult females.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.471
Brown hair, blue eyes.

15:54.533 --> 15:56.101
Single?

15:56.133 --> 15:57.975
Yes.

15:58.099 --> 15:59.576
Dating?

16:01.066 --> 16:03.475
No, I haven't been in a
relationship in a while.

16:05.133 --> 16:06.736
Why is that?

16:06.967 --> 16:09.034
It's less complicated.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.509
Take a seat.

16:20.333 --> 16:24.333
So here's what we are dealing with.

16:26.099 --> 16:27.542
Ready?

16:27.566 --> 16:28.873
Yeah.

16:49.266 --> 16:51.675
Jesus Christ!

16:55.933 --> 16:59.137
We look at images and
videos like that every day.

16:59.299 --> 17:01.708
Kids being abused...

17:03.233 --> 17:06.369
and tortured online while others watch.

17:06.999 --> 17:11.271
Our job is to not look away.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.632
The people who do that to kids...

17:17.633 --> 17:19.598
- Pedophiles.
- I want to stop them.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.634
You want to shoot them?
Beat them up? Put them in the ground?

17:22.867 --> 17:24.708
I want to stop 'em.

17:33.099 --> 17:36.372
Internet technology keeps leaping ahead.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.605
We're always playing catch-up.

17:39.867 --> 17:42.002
Sometimes the only way

17:42.066 --> 17:45.908
to find a needle in the haystack
is one straw at a time.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.841
Sam, our computer geek.
Mike, from Drugs.

17:53.932 --> 17:56.432
Everyone, this is Detective
Jeffrey Cornwall.

17:56.966 --> 18:00.799
You've already met Frank.
He is old school.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.504
- Young at heart.
- Yeah but, old everywhere else.

18:04.833 --> 18:08.065
And that's Teddy.
He has a very particular skill:

18:08.066 --> 18:09.899
visual pattern recognition.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.965
Teddy has an eye for detail.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.931
- Wanna show him, Teddy?
- No, I don't, Sam.

18:13.932 --> 18:15.132
I wish you would stop
doing this every time

18:15.133 --> 18:16.532
- someone new comes in the office.
- Come on.

18:16.533 --> 18:18.832
Come on, come on, come on. Come on.

18:18.833 --> 18:20.674
- All right.
- All right.

18:23.299 --> 18:29.175
Okay, it's like an old stone building.
It's a church or a castle or something.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.499
With a bridge going over a river.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.931
There's a woman standing on
the bridge in a beige coat,

18:35.932 --> 18:38.068
holding a red umbrella.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.065
That's impressive.

18:44.066 --> 18:47.065
Not really. Practice and guess work.

18:47.066 --> 18:48.872
Could have been a red kite.

18:49.600 --> 18:53.270
- So what's your deal, Jeff?
- Me?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.098
I arrest people.

18:55.099 --> 18:57.304
All right. Sounds good.

19:31.633 --> 19:34.132
- Promise.
- I promise.

19:34.899 --> 19:36.536
Pinkie promise.

19:36.666 --> 19:39.904
Okay. Pinkie promise.

19:40.733 --> 19:44.108
Cass, say bye to Albert, honey.
We gotta go.

19:44.366 --> 19:45.766
- Bye.
- Bye, Albert!

19:45.767 --> 19:47.403
- Bye!
- Bye, buddy.

19:48.899 --> 19:50.465
What were you guys talking about?

19:50.466 --> 19:52.732
I made him promise,
he'll never skate with anyone else.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.766
- Nobody else, ever as long as he lives?
- Nobody else.

19:54.767 --> 19:56.132
- Wow, that's a...
- That's a big promise.

19:56.133 --> 19:59.432
- For your whole life?
- Yeah. We're a team.

19:59.433 --> 20:02.274
- There's my girl. But we gotta go.
- Yeah. Bye.

20:02.366 --> 20:04.002
Come here.

20:06.533 --> 20:07.798
Okay, I'll see you at home. Love you!

20:07.799 --> 20:08.898
Bye!

20:08.899 --> 20:11.343
- Bye!
- Bye! I Bye!

20:25.832 --> 20:27.665
But the fact that you
guys made that promise

20:27.666 --> 20:29.265
to each other,
promise to always be a team,

20:29.266 --> 20:32.298
it means you have to start thinking
about how you present yourselves, okay?

20:32.299 --> 20:35.276
It's... it's... I'm just saying
that it's not necessary.

20:35.533 --> 20:38.098
You guys are so good
it's actually distracting.

20:38.099 --> 20:40.732
Albert thinks it makes us stand out.

20:40.733 --> 20:43.632
I don't think so. I think what makes
you stand out is your talent.

20:43.633 --> 20:47.042
Whether you got a white skate on one
foot and a black on the other it's...

20:48.700 --> 20:50.365
What's the... what's the
word I'm thinking of?

20:50.366 --> 20:52.432
- Irrelevant?
- Irrelevant. Right.

20:52.433 --> 20:53.831
Irrelevant.

20:53.832 --> 20:55.900
It's like a trick you don't need.

20:55.999 --> 20:58.374
- A trick?
- Yeah, exactly.

20:58.666 --> 21:02.365
- What's so funny?
- No, it's not a trick, it's a gimmick.

21:02.366 --> 21:04.765
- A gimmick we don't need.
- It's a gimmick you don't need.

21:04.766 --> 21:05.831
- A gimmick.
- Well, there you go.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.165
- It's the proper word.
- Oh, that's the proper word?

21:07.166 --> 21:09.939
- Yeah. Gimmick is the proper word.
- Thank you.

21:17.299 --> 21:18.640
Hello.

21:18.966 --> 21:21.865
Hi. Sarah called in sick.
I might be really late.

21:21.866 --> 21:23.207
Ouch.

21:23.799 --> 21:26.072
I don't know what you're
gonna do about dinner.

21:26.566 --> 21:29.872
Well, we'll be fine. We've actually
just pulled up to the pie shop.

21:31.032 --> 21:32.765
You gonna have pie for dinner?

21:32.766 --> 21:35.665
No. We're not gonna have pie for dinner.
We're gonna have macaroni for dinner.

21:35.666 --> 21:39.109
We have leftover macaroni.
We'll put that on top of the pie.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.566
All right.

21:41.766 --> 21:43.132
Will you get me the cherry-rhubarb?

21:43.133 --> 21:47.008
Cherry-rhubarb, got it. No problem.
Done. Love you. Bye.

21:47.066 --> 21:48.770
And ice cream.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.931
- What kind of ice cream?
- Chocolate.

21:51.932 --> 21:54.931
- On your macaroni?
- Ew! Not macaroni!

21:54.932 --> 21:56.698
It may be the grossest
thing I've ever heard.

21:56.699 --> 21:58.677
It's going to be an awesome dinner.

22:09.366 --> 22:11.998
Hey, Linda, you know what? You're lucky
that a 9-year-old makes the menu

22:11.999 --> 22:15.204
because that one in there
wants a macaroni pie.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.507
They didn't have chocolate
ice cream. So...

22:51.233 --> 22:53.335
Cass?

22:55.999 --> 22:57.374
Cass!

23:03.566 --> 23:05.168
Cass!

23:18.299 --> 23:19.832
Cass!

23:26.366 --> 23:28.104
Cass!

23:38.233 --> 23:40.731
- Hey, Linda, did Cass back here?
- No?

23:40.732 --> 23:43.835
Is she... is she in the back? Can you
take a look for me, please, thank you?

23:45.233 --> 23:47.404
- Nothing?
- No.

23:50.999 --> 23:53.033
Cass!

23:54.565 --> 23:56.509
Cassandra!

23:58.099 --> 23:59.508
Cass!

24:02.533 --> 24:03.941
Cass!

24:10.966 --> 24:12.568
Cass!

24:28.500 --> 24:30.999
I have a plan.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.071
A few minutes.

24:35.532 --> 24:37.805
That's all you'll have together.

24:39.932 --> 24:41.932
Do I get to talk to him?

24:42.333 --> 24:43.866
Yes.

24:46.266 --> 24:48.499
Does my Dad get to talk to me?

24:48.500 --> 24:51.238
Yes, Cass he does.

24:51.899 --> 24:53.798
And we'll be listening.

24:53.799 --> 24:58.266
Of course, I was thinking
some kind of mic...

24:58.599 --> 25:00.576
hidden microphone.

25:02.932 --> 25:05.103
What are you so worried about?

25:06.299 --> 25:08.673
I have no idea where I am.

25:09.599 --> 25:12.770
How would he ever find me?
I don't even know your name.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.671
Not a word...

25:21.166 --> 25:22.642
or else...

25:22.665 --> 25:24.506
You'll kill him.

25:30.466 --> 25:35.909
Wouldn't it just be easier to kill me...

25:39.400 --> 25:41.774
now that I'm all grown up?

25:43.899 --> 25:48.672
Now that you've lost interest.

25:51.299 --> 25:54.469
I can't be that valuable
doing what I'm doing.

25:58.532 --> 26:01.441
Oh, you are so valuable, Cassandra.

26:04.199 --> 26:07.972
Doing exactly what you're doing.

26:13.499 --> 26:17.533
- So it was the patrolman that flagged him?
- Yeah. Kicked down to us.

26:18.199 --> 26:20.199
- Okay.
- Ready?

26:20.299 --> 26:21.537
Yeah.

26:21.766 --> 26:24.641
- Okay?
- It's strange they'd send him here.

26:24.966 --> 26:27.399
Well, there weren't any
detectives at the main station.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.377
My buddy must have known
that I could do it.

26:31.732 --> 26:34.301
I'm not used to interviewing adults.

26:35.133 --> 26:36.701
You'll be fine.

26:38.832 --> 26:39.965
Mr. Lane.

26:39.966 --> 26:43.564
Hi. I'm Detective Dunlop and
this is Detective Cornwall.

26:43.565 --> 26:46.965
We have read through your statement that
you gave to the patrolman an hour ago.

26:46.966 --> 26:48.564
We'd just like to go over
a few details with you.

26:48.565 --> 26:49.906
Yeah. Good.

26:52.799 --> 26:54.332
Is it okay if we record this?

26:54.333 --> 26:56.969
Yeah. Did you see my wife?
Did someone give her a ride down?

26:57.399 --> 26:59.798
I don't know anything
about your wife, Mr. Lane.

26:59.799 --> 27:03.332
I... I called her three hours ago.
It shouldn't take her this long to get here.

27:03.333 --> 27:06.031
I'm worried that she went to the
main police station, not this one.

27:06.032 --> 27:07.838
I told her to take a cab.

27:08.199 --> 27:12.165
Okay. Let's just get
through these questions first

27:12.166 --> 27:14.298
and then we'll look into the
whereabouts of your wife. All right?

27:14.299 --> 27:18.367
Just to be clear, this conversation
is completely voluntary.

27:18.399 --> 27:21.464
And you are not being
forced to tell us anything.

27:21.465 --> 27:22.908
Do you understand this?

27:24.599 --> 27:26.332
- "Yes."
- Yes.

27:26.333 --> 27:31.464
Okay. Now, you say you were
in the diner for how long?

27:31.465 --> 27:34.132
A few minutes. Less.

27:34.133 --> 27:36.431
Okay. Were there any other customers?

27:36.432 --> 27:40.138
- No. I... I didn't see any.
- No customers.

27:40.333 --> 27:42.037
It says here you bought a pie?

27:42.632 --> 27:45.905
Yeah, we bought a...
we bought a cherry pie. My...

27:46.299 --> 27:48.398
my daughter... Yeah, we do
it every week after practice.

27:48.399 --> 27:49.531
I gotta get a pie.

27:49.532 --> 27:51.298
And I asked Linda if they
had chocolate ice cream...

27:51.299 --> 27:52.298
Sorry, you mean Lesley?

27:52.299 --> 27:54.276
And they... they... No.

27:54.365 --> 27:57.431
Linda. They didn't have any chocolate
ice cream. Can I call my wife now?

27:57.432 --> 28:00.103
It's "Lesley". I'm sorry,
it says Lesley right there.

28:01.266 --> 28:03.331
It says "Linda". I can see it from here.

28:03.332 --> 28:06.003
And my nine-year-old
daughter's another mile away.

28:06.365 --> 28:08.298
You have very good eyesight, Mr. Lane.

28:08.299 --> 28:10.498
But you claim you didn't see anything

28:10.499 --> 28:13.198
suspicious when you
looked back to the truck?

28:13.199 --> 28:15.403
It's been three hours since...

28:17.299 --> 28:20.664
someone driving, even if
he's going the speed limit,

28:20.665 --> 28:22.265
which he's not because
he's a fucking kidnapper,

28:22.266 --> 28:24.731
they're hundreds of miles away. Okay?

28:24.732 --> 28:25.765
They... they've taken my daughter.

28:25.766 --> 28:27.965
I need to know right now,
what are you doing to help?

28:27.966 --> 28:30.331
Have you got a helicopter up there?
Are you setting up a roadblock?

28:30.332 --> 28:31.965
What are you doing?
She's a ten-year-old girl.

28:31.966 --> 28:33.670
You said she was nine.

28:33.699 --> 28:34.972
What?

28:35.432 --> 28:38.297
You said she was nine.
Is she nine? Is she ten?

28:38.298 --> 28:39.998
What... what is she?

28:39.999 --> 28:42.874
She's almost ten. Christ,
what difference does it make?

28:43.665 --> 28:45.471
What difference does it...?

28:46.732 --> 28:49.709
- What's going on here?
- Linda... told the police

28:49.999 --> 28:53.374
that she never saw your daughter.

28:53.499 --> 28:56.102
Okay, so, what does that mean?

28:56.332 --> 28:59.810
When you pulled into the diner,
you were alone.

29:02.732 --> 29:04.132
Bullshit. I wasn't alone.

29:04.133 --> 29:06.498
She was resting in the back.
That's why she didn't see her.

29:06.499 --> 29:09.464
Okay. Why would she be resting
in the middle of the afternoon?

29:09.465 --> 29:11.798
Why wouldn't she be resting in the
middle of the fucking afternoon?

29:11.799 --> 29:16.297
She's a kid! A little girl, okay?
We just finished ice skating practice.

29:16.298 --> 29:18.198
- She was exhausted.
- Did you make any stops

29:18.199 --> 29:21.642
- between the rink and the diner?
- Okay.

29:23.166 --> 29:25.041
I'm gonna stop you right there.

29:26.799 --> 29:29.264
I was the last person to see
my daughter at the diner.

29:29.265 --> 29:31.436
That was me. Okay?

29:31.465 --> 29:35.198
Now, I would... I would like to
speak to somebody in charge.

29:35.199 --> 29:37.598
I'd like to speak to... to real police.

29:37.599 --> 29:41.065
I don't even... This looks like a
fucking kindergarten in here, okay.

29:41.066 --> 29:43.304
I need you to find my daughter, now!

29:47.499 --> 29:49.601
Mr. Lane, I'll ask again.

29:50.332 --> 29:54.805
Did you make any stops before
you arrived at the diner?

30:53.066 --> 30:55.372
I remember the day

30:56.133 --> 30:58.667
we won the trophy.

31:00.133 --> 31:05.372
The look on my mother's face as I
skated over and handed it to her.

31:07.198 --> 31:11.369
And it must be such an amazing
feeling for a parent,

31:12.365 --> 31:15.399
seeing their child realize a dream.

31:21.465 --> 31:25.000
That must be the hardest
part for Mum now,

31:27.265 --> 31:29.470
not knowing

31:30.265 --> 31:32.538
what I'm dreaming about.

31:34.066 --> 31:38.600
Or that I'm even alive to be dreaming.

31:43.465 --> 31:45.097
That's great, Cassandra.

31:45.098 --> 31:49.565
This time, do it again,
but a little less self-pity.

31:50.098 --> 31:52.898
Okay, do it, just one more
time and a little louder.

31:52.899 --> 31:55.637
Less self-pity. Got it?

32:12.966 --> 32:14.499
Tina...

32:14.932 --> 32:16.500
Tina.

32:16.699 --> 32:18.904
Tina, we stopped to get a pie.

32:19.032 --> 32:21.805
We stopped at the diner. You remember,
we spoke on the phone, remember?

32:21.899 --> 32:23.364
You remember, we stopped.
I got out of my truck.

32:23.365 --> 32:26.064
Right after we hung up I got out of
my truck and I went inside and I...

32:26.065 --> 32:28.531
I could see it. I could see it right
through the window. It was right there.

32:28.532 --> 32:30.798
The truck was right there and... and...

32:30.799 --> 32:33.097
And I went to the bathroom
for like two seconds

32:33.098 --> 32:35.701
and I came back out and
she was gone and she...

32:36.999 --> 32:40.499
What did you do? You lost our girl!

32:40.966 --> 32:43.131
You lost our girl!

32:43.132 --> 32:44.331
Don't.

32:44.332 --> 32:48.537
- No... No.
- She's gone...

33:02.632 --> 33:04.302
Mrs. Lane.

33:07.699 --> 33:11.206
- Mr. Lane, we need to speak to your wife now.
- It's gonna be okay.

33:11.365 --> 33:13.536
It's gonna be okay.

33:14.999 --> 33:17.601
Mrs. Lane.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.197
My name is Detective Dunlop.
I've been assigned to your case.

33:22.198 --> 33:24.642
- I just need to ask you a few questions.
- How long do you need to speak to her for?

33:24.998 --> 33:26.703
- A few minutes. Okay.
- Okay.

33:31.499 --> 33:33.032
Right here.

33:48.732 --> 33:52.266
I can't imagine what's going through
your wife's head right now.

33:53.998 --> 33:57.374
It's gotta be tough on you.
It's gotta be.

33:58.165 --> 34:02.336
Hey, listen, things get
crazy sometimes, you know?

34:04.799 --> 34:08.797
There seems to be some inconsistencies
about what your husband told us.

34:08.799 --> 34:12.764
Listen, I'm just... I'm going through the
files there, and I see... it's my job,

34:13.866 --> 34:16.400
I see you got an assault charge?

34:16.998 --> 34:18.567
Is that right?

34:22.132 --> 34:26.303
Teenage daddies with baby girls
shouldn't get into barroom brawls.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.964
Especially if they're not
old enough to drink.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.264
My wife knows about that.

34:29.264 --> 34:31.164
I was eighteen years old.
The fight was over her.

34:31.165 --> 34:35.404
So what, you quit school, you got a job
and now nine years later, you're broke.

34:36.632 --> 34:38.609
Yeah, money's tight. I get it.

34:41.866 --> 34:43.929
I heard you say something
to your wife about a...

34:43.931 --> 34:45.737
about a phone call.

34:45.799 --> 34:47.367
She called you, right?

34:47.465 --> 34:48.964
You didn't tell us about that.

34:48.965 --> 34:51.340
My partner's asking her
about that right now.

34:51.766 --> 34:54.264
Wondering if she spoke to
your daughter at that time.

34:54.264 --> 34:56.106
I guess if she didn't...

34:56.632 --> 34:58.498
if she didn't, then where is she?

34:58.499 --> 35:01.930
She's laying down in the back of the cab.
That's what she does. It's her little space.

35:01.931 --> 35:05.297
But don't kids stop taking afternoon naps
when they're like three or four years old?

35:05.298 --> 35:08.469
I mean, if my dad's buying my
favourite pie, I'm with him. I'm excited.

35:08.499 --> 35:11.033
Or I'm watching from the
car window, at least.

35:11.499 --> 35:13.374
Your business failed, right?

35:14.098 --> 35:15.798
Was it TM Landscaping?

35:15.799 --> 35:17.831
You got bills piling up.
You're about to go into bankruptcy.

35:17.832 --> 35:20.997
Like I said before, I get it.
I do, I get it.

35:20.998 --> 35:22.531
What the fuck are you talking about?

35:22.532 --> 35:24.796
Big money for lending your
daughter to some demented pal

35:24.896 --> 35:26.398
for a few days.
Then she's gonna show up,

35:26.399 --> 35:28.898
- damaged, but otherwise...
- You sick fucker!

35:34.532 --> 35:36.737
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

35:46.998 --> 35:49.997
This is what I do, okay? I give a
little shake, I see what falls out.

35:49.998 --> 35:52.731
As well, as give the judge every
reason to dismiss this case.

35:52.732 --> 35:54.831
He's not as innocent as he seems.

35:54.832 --> 35:57.097
- Maybe he is.
- He's got a criminal record.

35:57.098 --> 35:59.798
Assault. As well as a motive.
He owes money through his ears.

35:59.799 --> 36:03.831
So he creates an opportunity,
driving alone on a deserted highway.

36:03.832 --> 36:05.331
Give me a break.

36:05.432 --> 36:06.840
Hey!

36:11.699 --> 36:13.431
He reminds me of someone.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.204
Somebody from your past.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.973
Yeah, from my past.

36:18.831 --> 36:20.604
This is the present.

36:27.766 --> 36:31.732
Do you actually believe any of the things
he said to Matt the night we came in?

36:34.232 --> 36:37.505
I'm not going to excuse the way
that he behaved with Matthew.

36:37.965 --> 36:40.364
He's dealt with a lot of cases
where someone from the family,

36:40.365 --> 36:43.206
even a parent, is involved.

36:43.998 --> 36:46.305
Matthew reminded him of someone.

36:47.365 --> 36:50.672
- Someone personal.
- That's just bullshit.

36:52.831 --> 36:55.934
Matthew loved Cassandra more
than anything in this world.

36:57.031 --> 36:58.940
He still loves her.

37:00.232 --> 37:01.766
Of course.

37:02.065 --> 37:04.770
I don't know if I want
to do this anymore.

37:05.732 --> 37:07.368
I understand. It's up to you.

37:07.499 --> 37:09.533
Happy to meet you when you need.

37:33.831 --> 37:37.900
On this pillow you will find...

37:40.499 --> 37:44.636
a teeny-tiny tooth of mine.

37:49.465 --> 37:53.974
So while I sleep, where dreams are made

37:54.632 --> 37:57.473
let's see if we can make this trade.

38:06.998 --> 38:10.499
Money for teeth.

38:14.298 --> 38:18.298
It just seems strange to
exchange them for money.

38:19.132 --> 38:22.405
But it's something we all do.

38:24.632 --> 38:26.165
Or did.

38:29.931 --> 38:35.239
And if there ever was a Tooth
Fairy that visited me here,

38:36.898 --> 38:42.103
I'm sure there's something more useful
she could do than leaving me a dollar.

38:44.599 --> 38:47.201
Or maybe it's just a trick.

38:54.499 --> 38:59.101
A trick or a gimmick.

39:00.965 --> 39:03.772
A gimmick you don't really need.

39:04.831 --> 39:07.740
Yes, that's the proper word.

39:48.165 --> 39:50.165
Tina...

39:58.165 --> 39:59.506
How are you?

40:00.731 --> 40:02.936
I'm fine, I guess.

40:04.765 --> 40:07.970
Hard to believe I've been coming
to see you for six years.

40:09.798 --> 40:13.498
You look really good.
Better than last time.

40:13.499 --> 40:15.703
Yeah, I was a mess last time.

40:21.664 --> 40:23.301
How's Matthew?

40:25.499 --> 40:27.533
He's fine.

40:27.664 --> 40:30.233
Can I ask what's happening?

40:30.365 --> 40:32.069
I still can't look at him.

40:32.532 --> 40:33.940
I see Cass.

40:34.098 --> 40:37.303
I get mad. I say awful things.

40:38.132 --> 40:39.563
Is he completely out of the picture?

40:39.564 --> 40:41.337
- Last time...
- No.

40:41.532 --> 40:44.407
I was just speaking to him, actually.
He said that...

40:44.931 --> 40:46.840
that he wanted to come here.

40:47.399 --> 40:49.103
So why didn't he?

40:49.865 --> 40:51.897
I called him and left him a message.

40:51.898 --> 40:54.205
He thought I'd end up screaming at him.

40:55.831 --> 40:57.468
Would you?

40:57.998 --> 40:59.532
Probably.

41:02.132 --> 41:04.973
He still thinks he's gonna
find her on his own.

41:05.132 --> 41:07.109
Does he tell you how?

41:07.931 --> 41:09.730
You mean does he have a plan?

41:09.731 --> 41:11.470
Matthew?

41:11.898 --> 41:14.097
Oh yeah. His plan is that
he's on the road a lot.

41:14.098 --> 41:16.098
He keeps his eyes open. Idiot.

41:19.098 --> 41:21.507
I don't sound very nice, do I?

41:21.731 --> 41:23.464
I've heard a lot worse.

41:23.465 --> 41:25.067
Yeah, I bet.

41:26.965 --> 41:29.033
I couldn't do what you do.

41:37.098 --> 41:38.530
You have a daughter?

41:38.531 --> 41:39.906
No.

41:45.265 --> 41:48.674
That's Jeffrey's niece, Jennifer.

41:49.598 --> 41:52.440
- They're really close.
- That's nice.

41:54.498 --> 41:57.169
So should we start?

42:04.664 --> 42:07.903
When you think of Cass,

42:09.198 --> 42:11.039
what do you see?

42:13.564 --> 42:15.133
What do I see?

42:17.498 --> 42:20.771
Mostly I think about her skating.
She loved it so much.

42:21.498 --> 42:23.864
She and Albert,
that was her partner, they...

42:23.865 --> 42:26.097
they talked about going to the Olympics.

42:26.098 --> 42:29.530
And Matt still goes to the rink sometimes
just to watch Albert practice.

42:29.531 --> 42:32.634
It's like they're both just
waiting for Cass to come back.

42:33.464 --> 42:35.839
And Albert's really strong.

42:35.931 --> 42:39.840
So if Cass stays small like me...

42:41.065 --> 42:43.735
They could carry on where they left off.

42:50.399 --> 42:51.875
We're here.

42:58.332 --> 42:59.663
Mrs. Lane.

42:59.664 --> 43:00.971
Hi.

43:01.165 --> 43:02.903
Hello.

43:03.898 --> 43:05.307
Come in.

43:10.498 --> 43:11.941
Please.

43:16.998 --> 43:18.668
Okay.

43:20.398 --> 43:22.630
Mrs. Lane, do you know a
lot of illegal images of kids

43:22.631 --> 43:24.938
are circulated on the internet?

43:26.464 --> 43:30.498
And any picture like that is actual
evidence of where a crime has taken place.

43:30.765 --> 43:32.503
Do you understand that?

43:32.865 --> 43:34.597
We study these crime scene images.

43:34.598 --> 43:36.997
We use whatever information
we get out of them to track

43:36.998 --> 43:39.430
down the people who trade
in these illegal pictures.

43:39.431 --> 43:43.602
To find the children. To rescue them.

43:43.931 --> 43:46.908
Sometimes to gain access
to certain rooms,

43:48.664 --> 43:50.436
I play a role.

43:54.298 --> 43:57.036
I try and fit in with the
other men who are...

43:57.298 --> 44:02.037
who are watching the abuse
that's taking place in a room.

44:02.065 --> 44:06.008
The men are all connected to a camera.

44:06.531 --> 44:11.736
They might give directions
or participate.

44:13.165 --> 44:17.802
- A live camera that's in a room.
- Doing what?

44:19.865 --> 44:21.808
Watching a child.

44:25.564 --> 44:30.008
Jeffrey believes that he may

44:30.564 --> 44:32.837
have found some images of Cass.

44:34.398 --> 44:36.897
- You found her?
- No. No, no, no. Just a...

44:36.898 --> 44:40.830
a few screen grabs. Pictures. That's it.

44:40.831 --> 44:43.070
They were recent.

44:43.531 --> 44:45.872
So the good...

44:45.965 --> 44:49.374
- the really good news...
- She's alive.

45:47.331 --> 45:48.865
Mrs. Lane?

45:56.398 --> 45:58.273
Tina?

46:00.132 --> 46:02.734
Do you think this could be Cass?

46:07.065 --> 46:08.871
I think so.

46:34.231 --> 46:35.902
Hey... How'd it go?

46:35.965 --> 46:38.772
Matthew, listen to me.
They showed me a picture of her.

46:39.098 --> 46:41.438
They found a picture of her.

46:42.765 --> 46:44.742
What do you mean, a picture of Cass?

46:45.965 --> 46:47.305
From where?

46:48.231 --> 46:50.766
They don't know.
They found it on a computer.

46:52.898 --> 46:55.263
Well, when was...
when was the picture from?

46:55.264 --> 46:57.196
They don't know. It was just her face.

46:57.197 --> 47:01.334
They just showed me a picture of her face.
But it's... it's her, Matthew, it's her.

47:02.564 --> 47:04.564
What's she doing in the photo?

47:04.631 --> 47:06.006
Well...

47:06.231 --> 47:07.263
Tina?

47:07.264 --> 47:10.296
Like I said, they... they don't know.
You know, it was just her face. But...

47:10.297 --> 47:12.697
but they said that she was
talking to another girl.

47:12.698 --> 47:14.097
Like a younger girl.

47:14.098 --> 47:15.597
Okay, but... okay. Okay, I got it.

47:15.598 --> 47:19.200
But, what... what's she actually
doing in the... in the picture?

47:19.364 --> 47:21.535
Like, I said, they don't know. Like...

47:22.065 --> 47:24.597
You could have been there and then
you would know all of this already.

47:24.598 --> 47:26.064
I said they don't know.

47:26.065 --> 47:27.473
Okay?

47:28.065 --> 47:32.099
But it was her. It was
her face. And they said...

47:32.664 --> 47:34.607
they said that... you know,

47:34.931 --> 47:38.196
they're always looking for children
and that Cass is like a...

47:38.197 --> 47:40.606
I can't remember exactly what they said.

47:41.331 --> 47:44.900
But they said she's like a...
like a welcoming face on a gateway.

47:45.164 --> 47:47.369
Or... or something like that.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.667
Gateway? What do you mean a gateway?

47:50.531 --> 47:52.337
To what?

48:02.164 --> 48:04.040
Tina?

48:06.264 --> 48:08.742
To a ring, they said.

48:11.598 --> 48:16.405
Welcoming face to a gateway, to a ring.

48:18.731 --> 48:23.030
She's helping lure other kids...

48:23.031 --> 48:24.633
Honey...

48:25.464 --> 48:27.635
They've made her like them.

48:30.998 --> 48:33.532
That's what happened to
our daughter, Matthew.

48:36.831 --> 48:39.501
She's helping recruit other kids.

48:41.398 --> 48:44.739
That's what happened
when you left her alone.

48:46.264 --> 48:48.969
Those monsters came and took her.

48:48.998 --> 48:51.475
And now she sits with her smiling face

48:51.865 --> 48:53.706
and talks to other babies.

48:54.631 --> 48:56.938
And then they go and get them.

48:58.297 --> 49:06.537
That's what happened to her
when you left her alone.

49:17.731 --> 49:21.208
My fate is grief and lamentation.

49:22.765 --> 49:25.799
My daughter's life has been betrayed.

49:26.865 --> 49:29.865
All joy has turned to desolation.

49:30.097 --> 49:33.131
An evil friend has stolen her away.

49:37.464 --> 49:39.600
Is that how you see yourself...

49:40.464 --> 49:42.407
as an evil friend?

49:43.131 --> 49:45.007
Sometimes.

49:46.631 --> 49:48.608
Where is this from?

49:50.097 --> 49:52.939
Mozart. It's the...

49:53.564 --> 49:57.405
Queen of the Night's aria
from The Magic Flute.

49:57.765 --> 50:00.299
And how's it going to
help you catch any kids?

50:01.431 --> 50:02.797
What do you mean?

50:02.798 --> 50:06.070
It doesn't seem like the sort of
thing that would attract them.

50:08.030 --> 50:09.667
It's not.

50:15.064 --> 50:17.405
It's part of story time, Cass.

50:18.664 --> 50:20.607
But it's not my story.

50:31.464 --> 50:39.101
The only thing I have to do today

50:40.197 --> 50:43.196
Is to get to the garden

50:43.197 --> 50:45.764
To pick some sage

50:45.765 --> 50:52.436
And wrap lavender with blue string

50:53.564 --> 50:59.167
And set the cedar leaves out for drying

51:05.865 --> 51:08.364
Is it spring yet?

51:11.798 --> 51:12.933
No.

51:13.598 --> 51:16.006
What's happening with my Dad?

51:16.731 --> 51:18.469
You promised.

51:24.564 --> 51:26.302
Why don't you just...

51:27.898 --> 51:32.432
get back to reading
about your evil friend?

51:39.897 --> 51:45.569
I still see her shaking,
her heart breaking.

51:46.731 --> 51:51.265
How dreadful her crying,
how hopeless her sighing...

52:40.598 --> 52:41.996
Make her ears stick out.

52:41.997 --> 52:43.940
- Why?
- It's hotter.

52:44.598 --> 52:47.029
- Pardon me?
- Well, if you're going to bait the trap...

52:47.030 --> 52:49.235
Use the best bait.

52:51.830 --> 52:55.130
If you're going for hot,
cross your eyes a little.

52:55.131 --> 52:57.199
What? It's true. Try it.

52:58.464 --> 52:59.997
That's weird, man.

53:00.765 --> 53:04.208
- The cross eyes are perfect.
- All right.

53:07.464 --> 53:08.296
We're on.

53:08.297 --> 53:10.433
- Is it Willy?
- Yeah, Willy.

53:20.664 --> 53:23.800
Reel him in, Jeff. Reel him in.

53:24.664 --> 53:27.334
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

53:29.431 --> 53:31.374
Yes! Yes!

54:13.231 --> 54:14.401
Hi.

54:14.864 --> 54:16.364
It's Willy.

54:19.830 --> 54:21.535
Sorry. My mistake.

54:21.764 --> 54:23.367
You bet it is.

54:24.164 --> 54:27.232
Stop! Stop right there!

54:28.064 --> 54:30.166
It's not what you think!
I'm a Good Samaritan.

54:30.197 --> 54:33.763
Well, these arrests are the
result of amazing team work.

54:33.764 --> 54:36.729
Incredible cooperation from a
number of different departments.

54:36.730 --> 54:39.796
- Next time you're doing this.
- You look good on camera.

54:39.797 --> 54:42.002
...the public and media.

54:42.631 --> 54:46.233
You know, we all have to be vigilant.

54:46.431 --> 54:49.771
You know, there may be young people
who are watching this right now,

54:50.030 --> 54:52.996
some of you might have come to see me.

54:52.997 --> 54:55.804
And you've trusted me with your stories

54:55.930 --> 54:58.896
- and I want you to remember...
- I see you do that, you know.

54:58.897 --> 55:02.375
When you're in that room
with those kids, I watch you.

55:02.964 --> 55:04.929
The way you get them
to trust you like that.

55:04.930 --> 55:07.203
The way you talk to them. It's amazing.

55:08.398 --> 55:10.000
Look at me.

55:10.297 --> 55:12.399
No, look at me. You're amazing.

55:12.797 --> 55:15.468
- You're amazing.
- ...we'll show them that we can win.

55:15.564 --> 55:17.196
So, you know,

55:17.197 --> 55:19.096
- Thank you.
- If you're a young person out there

55:19.097 --> 55:21.196
and you think that an adult around you

55:21.197 --> 55:23.674
is behaving or acting in
an inappropriate way...

55:23.730 --> 55:25.163
I want you to call us.

55:25.164 --> 55:27.971
Call the police. We are here to help.

55:28.097 --> 55:29.996
And... and also, you know, if...

55:29.997 --> 55:33.463
if you are online and you
meet any stranger online,

55:33.464 --> 55:37.100
be very careful,
in any chat or in any way,

55:37.531 --> 55:39.406
you have to be on guard.

55:42.464 --> 55:46.032
I know that it'll... it'll all work out.

55:50.897 --> 55:53.170
What makes you so sure?

55:55.531 --> 56:00.838
They have only cracked the first ring.

56:02.663 --> 56:06.107
They'll never get to us. We are safe.

56:06.331 --> 56:09.468
Encrypted beyond the reach of God.

56:11.897 --> 56:14.500
Do not give them the key, Willy.

56:14.830 --> 56:17.604
Under no circumstance do you

56:17.864 --> 56:20.829
take any of the bullshit
deals that they offer.

56:20.830 --> 56:24.029
You deny. Deny, deny, deny, deny, deny.

56:24.030 --> 56:29.531
That bitch that set me up,
I want her removed.

56:31.663 --> 56:34.266
- She's a cop, Willy.
- I don't care.

56:34.830 --> 56:36.864
That's what I want.

56:38.164 --> 56:39.763
- Willy, just listen to me for a second...
- No.

56:39.764 --> 56:42.037
- No. No!
- That's not...

56:42.197 --> 56:46.072
You listen to me, cousin.

56:47.364 --> 56:50.932
I'll keep quiet about our little club

56:50.964 --> 56:53.896
as long as she's taught a lesson.

56:53.897 --> 56:57.398
I... I want her buried.

56:58.531 --> 57:00.201
Like the others.

57:00.730 --> 57:03.230
Only she stays alive.

57:05.564 --> 57:08.870
She tells me her stories.

57:09.597 --> 57:12.734
All of her stories.

57:17.830 --> 57:20.433
I lost this one yesterday.

57:20.464 --> 57:22.202
You know what the best idea is?

57:22.531 --> 57:25.230
Write a note beside your tooth
when you put it under your pillow.

57:25.231 --> 57:27.901
That way the Tooth Fairy will
know what to get you next time.

57:27.964 --> 57:30.196
But letters are for Santa.

57:30.197 --> 57:32.470
Do you still believe in Santa?

57:32.630 --> 57:34.335
Sometimes.

57:35.630 --> 57:37.607
Okay. Well, I'm not
talking about a letter.

57:37.630 --> 57:39.130
Just a note.

57:39.864 --> 57:43.240
If you want we can meet and I
can show you how to write one.

57:43.531 --> 57:45.803
That way you can get anything you want.

57:48.530 --> 57:50.463
I thought you weren't coming 'til later?

57:50.464 --> 57:51.397
What's going on?

57:51.398 --> 57:53.629
Look. Look. Don't let
this freak you out, okay?

57:53.630 --> 57:55.096
I talked to my brother.
He knows everything.

57:55.097 --> 57:57.165
He's cool. He's okay. It's okay.

57:57.197 --> 57:59.867
- What?
- Hey, hey, hey, She's talking to Cass.

57:59.964 --> 58:01.330
She's talking to Cass.

58:01.331 --> 58:03.206
Get Jennifer to find out where she is.

58:03.630 --> 58:06.074
Nicole. Nicole!

58:06.331 --> 58:08.865
- Nicole!
- Hi, Nicole. We're playing a game.

58:14.231 --> 58:15.969
What happened?

58:16.264 --> 58:18.002
I don't know.

58:18.630 --> 58:21.165
Hey, would you mind waiting
in the bedroom for a little bit?

58:22.030 --> 58:25.130
- We were just playing a game.
- No. I know. I understand.

58:25.131 --> 58:28.131
I just need to talk to your
uncle for a little bit, okay?

58:30.097 --> 58:33.596
- Did I do something wrong?
- No. No, you did nothing wrong.

58:33.597 --> 58:36.562
As a matter of fact, there's a
book back there waiting for you.

58:36.563 --> 58:38.963
The sequel to the one you asked for

58:38.964 --> 58:42.737
and I would love for you to get started
on that, tell me what you think.

58:57.530 --> 59:00.330
- Are you out of your mind?
- Do you have any idea what you just did?

59:00.331 --> 59:02.296
- Do you have any idea?
- You put Jennifer online.

59:02.297 --> 59:03.529
I'm in contact.

59:03.530 --> 59:05.363
I've been trying to break in forever!

59:05.364 --> 59:07.529
Okay, I needed to show I
had access to a real girl.

59:07.530 --> 59:10.598
- What?
- To get to Cass.

59:10.864 --> 59:14.274
That's what she does, okay?
She helps them bring them in.

59:15.164 --> 59:16.029
Nothing happened here.

59:16.030 --> 59:17.163
- Nothing!
- Nothing?

59:17.164 --> 59:18.629
- Nothing.
- ...except images of Cass.

59:18.630 --> 59:19.996
Images of nothing!

59:19.997 --> 59:22.330
Of her talking in this room.
That's it. That's all.

59:22.331 --> 59:25.535
You don't use children!

59:31.097 --> 59:32.963
- Listen to me.
- No, no, no, no, no.

59:32.964 --> 59:35.169
- Don't touch me.
- Listen to me.

59:35.430 --> 59:38.496
- I screwed up, okay? I screwed up.
- You're out of my unit.

59:38.497 --> 59:39.929
I should have done this a long time ago.

59:39.930 --> 59:41.729
Try to take it easy.
We got tonight, please.

59:41.730 --> 59:43.696
I don't want you there tonight.

59:43.697 --> 59:46.330
- You don't want me there tonight?
- No. I'm going alone.

59:46.331 --> 59:47.807
Okay, you're going alone.

59:48.297 --> 59:52.002
Jennifer, baby.
I gotta go, I'll call you soon.

01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:34.204
Detective Dunlop.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:35.763
Hi.

01:00:35.764 --> 01:00:37.496
- Nicole.
- Hi. Diane Grey.

01:00:37.497 --> 01:00:40.664
I'm so glad you could make it.
You look... just fabulous.

01:00:40.765 --> 01:00:42.967
- Thank you. You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:00:43.164 --> 01:00:46.039
Are you alone? I... I thought
you were coming with a guest.

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:49.840
He had a work emergency.

01:00:49.897 --> 01:00:52.533
Of course. Please come in.

01:00:53.663 --> 01:00:56.263
Is there anything you want help
with this evening that I...?

01:00:56.264 --> 01:01:00.207
- I mean straightforward.
- Yeah, I just... no, no thank you...

01:01:00.264 --> 01:01:03.362
- I feel that I should've wrote something...
- Hello, gorgeous lady.

01:01:03.363 --> 01:01:06.363
- Mika! Very well.
- How are you? You look lovely tonight.

01:01:06.364 --> 01:01:09.470
Thank you. Let me introduce
you to Detective Dunlop.

01:01:27.597 --> 01:01:28.629
Thank you.

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:30.766
Can I talk you into a
glass of champagne?

01:01:30.897 --> 01:01:32.396
Oh, no thank you.

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:36.397
Detective Dunlop, I'm Vince Grey.

01:01:37.463 --> 01:01:39.066
Oh, Diane's Vince.

01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:42.763
Yeah. Yeah. This is...

01:01:42.764 --> 01:01:44.562
this is remarkable.

01:01:44.563 --> 01:01:48.064
I mean, the difference
really is... that's...

01:01:49.363 --> 01:01:51.662
Is this the way you dress at work?

01:01:51.663 --> 01:01:54.663
No. I do a lot of my work with children.

01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:57.329
- They wouldn't feel comfortable...
- Yeah, with that look of authority.

01:01:57.330 --> 01:01:59.569
I guess most of them
feel betrayed by that.

01:02:00.131 --> 01:02:03.631
- By what?
- By the people they're supposed to trust.

01:02:05.563 --> 01:02:07.699
Here you are.

01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:09.196
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

01:02:09.197 --> 01:02:10.496
Did I say something to...

01:02:10.497 --> 01:02:12.429
- You're on.
- Okay.

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:13.462
Okay.

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:15.804
- Excuse me. Nice to meet you too.
- Nice to meet you.

01:02:16.296 --> 01:02:17.063
Everything okay?

01:02:17.064 --> 01:02:18.295
Yeah. Good.

01:02:18.296 --> 01:02:20.230
My deepest thank you.

01:02:20.231 --> 01:02:23.629
Without your generosity, an evening
like this simply wouldn't happen.

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:25.629
And we wouldn't be able to celebrate

01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:29.596
the remarkable woman I'm
about to introduce to you.

01:02:30.197 --> 01:02:34.596
Why Detective Nicole Dunlop has
become a very public figure recently,

01:02:34.597 --> 01:02:39.472
most of her time is spent in a
room where she listens to stories.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:46.200
Stories told by the most vulnerable
members of our society, our children.

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:50.304
They come to trust her.
And they feel safe.

01:02:51.864 --> 01:02:54.429
The difference between a youth at risk

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:59.601
and a young person with their
whole life ahead of them

01:03:00.463 --> 01:03:04.169
is care and concern.

01:03:06.263 --> 01:03:11.673
I know this because I nearly
fell through the cracks.

01:03:12.597 --> 01:03:14.699
I was living on the street.

01:03:14.764 --> 01:03:20.606
I spent my fourteenth birthday
sleeping in an abandoned van.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:24.503
If I hadn't been placed with
the right foster family,

01:03:24.597 --> 01:03:26.699
I'd have stayed there.

01:03:27.563 --> 01:03:29.665
And that's a scary thought.

01:03:30.897 --> 01:03:33.533
Because the kids I know from those days

01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:39.332
disappeared or died.

01:03:42.097 --> 01:03:44.938
If I showed you pictures
related to my work

01:03:45.663 --> 01:03:47.663
most of you would cry.

01:03:48.164 --> 01:03:53.937
The awful truth is that there are no
happy endings in my line of work.

01:03:54.163 --> 01:04:01.540
There are only stories that just stop.

01:04:05.764 --> 01:04:07.139
On a good day,

01:04:07.764 --> 01:04:10.172
I capture the scum of the earth.

01:04:10.397 --> 01:04:12.272
On a good day,

01:04:12.563 --> 01:04:16.199
I help a damaged young person

01:04:16.263 --> 01:04:18.262
take a step forward

01:04:18.263 --> 01:04:22.707
on a very long journey through
the kind of nightmare that

01:04:23.897 --> 01:04:26.431
would ruin this lovely dinner.

01:04:31.597 --> 01:04:33.233
Listen,

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:38.808
you don't want me in your life.

01:04:41.064 --> 01:04:45.007
You never want me to
come into the picture.

01:04:46.563 --> 01:04:48.563
Not with your child.

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:52.295
So please, write big cheques

01:04:52.296 --> 01:04:55.706
and maybe none of you will
ever have to see me again.

01:04:58.096 --> 01:05:01.369
It's been such an honour
to be here. Thank you.

01:05:09.663 --> 01:05:12.140
The speech is over.

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:16.467
We broke all our records,
thanks to you. It is time to celebrate.

01:05:19.697 --> 01:05:21.868
- All right. One glass.
- Okay.

01:05:23.563 --> 01:05:25.129
Cheers. Thank you so much.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:27.095
- Cheers. Thank you.
- Cheers.

01:05:27.096 --> 01:05:29.335
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:05:32.263 --> 01:05:34.929
So, I... I got to ask you,

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:37.805
how can you stand to be in the same room

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:40.007
as some of these people?

01:05:40.897 --> 01:05:43.135
Criminals are easy.

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:46.098
The tough part is the technology.

01:05:46.263 --> 01:05:49.331
Really? How... how so?

01:05:51.063 --> 01:05:57.195
Well, right now we're working with
this locked network that has the best

01:05:57.196 --> 01:05:59.129
encryption we've ever seen.

01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:04.195
So, the bad guys are winning then?
Is that what you're saying?

01:06:04.196 --> 01:06:07.004
Well, my guys are really good.

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:11.373
You know, my guys are really good and...
and one of them thinks that...

01:06:11.663 --> 01:06:13.037
Well...

01:06:16.063 --> 01:06:17.666
I'm sorry.

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:22.030
I'm sorry that just got...
got past security.

01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:25.429
No, I'm sorry. Once you get me going...

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:29.339
No, it's... No Mika and I are just...
we're working on a big project.

01:06:29.463 --> 01:06:34.839
The day after begins before
the day before ends. It's just.

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:37.963
Oh, I can't even read that.

01:06:37.964 --> 01:06:38.995
Is it getting late?

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:42.736
That's why they make women's watches
so small, so you can't see how late it is.

01:07:06.296 --> 01:07:07.637
Oh, that's great.

01:07:08.463 --> 01:07:11.133
- Now just pour me into a taxi.
- A taxi?

01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:13.273
No, why don't I give you a ride.

01:07:18.397 --> 01:07:20.101
Thank you.

01:07:25.463 --> 01:07:26.940
Thanks.

01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:02.396
I better call my boyfriend.

01:08:02.397 --> 01:08:05.529
- Why?
- 'Cause I don't feel very well.

01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:07.507
No, you look fine.

01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:11.962
I don't want him to worry.

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:13.906
Well, let him worry.

01:08:14.597 --> 01:08:16.665
You're not a helpless child.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:20.902
Hey.

01:08:24.895 --> 01:08:26.339
Come here.

01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:38.207
You know, one professional to another,

01:08:39.029 --> 01:08:42.404
I wish I'd met someone like
you when I was a little girl.

01:09:50.563 --> 01:09:52.496
Are you joking?
Didn't you get the message?

01:09:52.497 --> 01:09:53.261
What message?

01:09:53.263 --> 01:09:55.496
There's a snowstorm out here.
I'm sending everybody home.

01:09:55.497 --> 01:09:57.596
Anyway, I want these here tomorrow
when the landscaper's here.

01:09:57.597 --> 01:09:58.895
Hey, I was driving all day man.

01:09:58.896 --> 01:10:00.795
- You can place them where they need to go...
- didn't plan on spending the night.

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:03.195
Listen, there's a place
just down the highway.

01:10:03.196 --> 01:10:05.396
The Richard Lake Motel. Just stay there.

01:10:05.397 --> 01:10:08.135
Bring the receipts, I'll look after it.

01:14:00.662 --> 01:14:02.435
Hi, Daddy.

01:14:08.263 --> 01:14:10.035
No cry.

01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:19.572
Are you... are you okay?

01:14:20.497 --> 01:14:23.031
You okay? Yeah?

01:14:28.529 --> 01:14:31.064
Oh, I've missed you so much.

01:14:35.562 --> 01:14:38.404
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

01:14:38.497 --> 01:14:40.905
- Yeah?
- How's Mum?

01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:46.606
We miss you so much

01:14:48.763 --> 01:14:51.968
I wanted to see you so much.

01:14:52.562 --> 01:14:56.063
He understood. Just this once.

01:14:56.497 --> 01:14:58.940
He wanted me to be happy.

01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:02.007
- As happy as I could be, so...
- Who?

01:15:02.529 --> 01:15:04.006
Who, Cass?

01:15:06.163 --> 01:15:07.605
Who?

01:15:08.929 --> 01:15:11.528
I thought... I've thought about
you every second of the day.

01:15:11.529 --> 01:15:13.695
- I'm so sorry. I should never have left you.
- There's nothing...

01:15:13.696 --> 01:15:15.429
I shouldn't have left you.

01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:17.100
No, you shouldn't have.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:19.329
But it happened so fast.

01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:22.205
They would have got me anyway.
They were following us.

01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:24.872
Who?

01:15:27.029 --> 01:15:28.938
Who, Cass, who are they?

01:15:29.029 --> 01:15:31.495
Come on. You gotta come home

01:15:31.496 --> 01:15:32.595
to Mum. Let's go.

01:15:32.596 --> 01:15:34.801
- Was it just a trick?
- Come on. What?

01:15:35.196 --> 01:15:36.900
The day you lost me.

01:15:36.996 --> 01:15:38.734
Was it just a trick?

01:15:39.196 --> 01:15:41.461
Or maybe gimmick's a better word.

01:15:41.462 --> 01:15:43.495
Something we didn't need.

01:15:43.496 --> 01:15:46.906
We were so good. We didn't need
anything like to get attention.

01:15:47.596 --> 01:15:49.295
What, Cass? What are you talking about?

01:15:49.296 --> 01:15:51.137
One black and one white.

01:15:51.496 --> 01:15:52.939
So distracting.

01:15:53.196 --> 01:15:55.695
Was it just a gimmick? A trick?

01:15:55.696 --> 01:15:57.867
Cass, I... I don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

01:15:58.196 --> 01:16:00.639
A trick you don't need sounds so funny.

01:16:00.929 --> 01:16:03.463
Yes, gimmick's a better word.

01:16:03.662 --> 01:16:05.129
Irrelevant.

01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:07.573
We were so good we didn't need gimmicks.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.139
A promise was made.

01:16:10.896 --> 01:16:12.964
Was that promise kept?

01:16:17.496 --> 01:16:19.974
They arranged this so
that I would be happy.

01:16:20.462 --> 01:16:22.962
They'll do anything to keep me happy.

01:16:23.130 --> 01:16:26.505
Anything. I'm so precious to them.

01:16:28.296 --> 01:16:29.932
I have to go.

01:16:30.529 --> 01:16:32.062
I... I have to go.

01:16:32.063 --> 01:16:33.336
What? No.

01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:34.995
- You can't do it. Please, Dad,
- No!

01:16:34.996 --> 01:16:36.129
- No! No. I don't...
- you can't tell anybody.

01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:37.495
- No I'm gonna tell...
- Promise me, Daddy.

01:16:37.496 --> 01:16:39.595
- I'm telling the police. You're coming with me.
- You have to pretend it's all a dream.

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:41.928
- You'll never see me again.
- You're coming to see your mother. I...

01:16:41.929 --> 01:16:43.628
- No! Daddy, no!
- I've got you in my hands.

01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:45.229
...you're not going anywhere.
You understand me?

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:46.036
No.

01:16:46.363 --> 01:16:47.862
No.

01:16:49.562 --> 01:16:50.995
- No.
- Cass...

01:16:50.996 --> 01:16:52.734
Daddy.

01:16:53.296 --> 01:16:55.966
- Daddy.
- Cass.

01:17:03.063 --> 01:17:05.801
Okay, boys, show's over.

01:17:07.196 --> 01:17:08.866
Go on, now.

01:17:10.496 --> 01:17:12.871
He'll be conscious in ten minutes.

01:17:23.362 --> 01:17:25.464
All right, Cassandra.

01:17:28.296 --> 01:17:31.171
Alright, now.

01:17:32.596 --> 01:17:35.096
It's time to go home. Yeah.

01:17:36.896 --> 01:17:39.930
Cassandra, let's go home.

01:17:40.863 --> 01:17:46.636
All right. All right. All right.

01:17:48.763 --> 01:17:50.604
Come on, sweetie.

01:17:51.329 --> 01:17:52.738
That's it.

01:17:53.829 --> 01:17:55.465
That's it.

01:17:58.296 --> 01:18:02.933
Detective, I really hope you don't
think I was avoiding your phone calls.

01:18:03.230 --> 01:18:07.295
It's just that I have spoken already
to two other colleagues of yours.

01:18:07.296 --> 01:18:08.898
Yeah, I understand that.

01:18:09.063 --> 01:18:10.395
As I told them,

01:18:10.396 --> 01:18:14.965
I have no idea how this woman would
find her way into our charity ball.

01:18:15.196 --> 01:18:18.095
You have to understand that this
is a very well-publicized event.

01:18:18.096 --> 01:18:19.628
Tell me, what was your your contact

01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:21.765
with the woman after
she came to your table?

01:18:22.096 --> 01:18:24.262
I hardly spoke with her.

01:18:24.263 --> 01:18:27.895
There was only one empty
chair in the whole room

01:18:27.896 --> 01:18:30.634
and she took that empty seat.

01:18:30.696 --> 01:18:34.361
You see, Detective Dunlop was
supposed to come with a guest.

01:18:34.362 --> 01:18:35.771
Yeah. We...

01:18:40.429 --> 01:18:43.328
She decided that she...
she wanted to go alone.

01:18:43.329 --> 01:18:45.704
- So you...?
- Yeah.

01:18:48.396 --> 01:18:54.468
Could this mystery woman have somehow
known that you weren't coming?

01:18:57.262 --> 01:18:58.428
I'm sorry, you're the detective.

01:18:58.429 --> 01:19:00.294
Can you tell me anything
more about this woman?

01:19:00.295 --> 01:19:02.363
Any details, anything at all?

01:19:03.429 --> 01:19:05.600
Did you see them leave together?

01:19:05.729 --> 01:19:07.561
I saw the back of them.

01:19:07.562 --> 01:19:10.767
But I was speaking with
someone else at that moment.

01:19:12.196 --> 01:19:15.561
I think I heard the woman
offer Detective Dunlop a ride.

01:19:15.562 --> 01:19:17.698
Didn't that strike you as suspicious?

01:19:17.763 --> 01:19:19.172
Suspicious?

01:19:19.196 --> 01:19:21.595
A stranger offers a
police officer a ride?

01:19:21.596 --> 01:19:23.232
She needed one.

01:19:24.562 --> 01:19:27.733
She was alone, after all.

01:20:02.329 --> 01:20:03.829
Hello?

01:20:05.163 --> 01:20:06.935
Is anyone there?

01:20:07.963 --> 01:20:09.735
Hello?

01:20:17.195 --> 01:20:19.095
Oh, yeah, I know. I know.

01:20:19.096 --> 01:20:21.495
You've been really understanding.
I appreciate that.

01:20:21.496 --> 01:20:23.495
I mean that. Do you have
any idea where she's gone?

01:20:23.496 --> 01:20:25.328
- No.
- Or where she's working now?

01:20:25.329 --> 01:20:28.661
Linda used to make sure that these are
up all the time... it's not up right now.

01:20:28.762 --> 01:20:30.461
- She stopped working here last year.
- I understand that.

01:20:30.562 --> 01:20:33.596
I'm going to put it up
right now, okay? Thank you.

01:21:29.763 --> 01:21:33.194
- What's so funny?
- No, it's not a trick, it's a gimmick.

01:21:33.195 --> 01:21:34.895
A gimmick we don't need.

01:21:34.896 --> 01:21:37.669
That day you lost me.
Was it just a trick?

01:21:38.063 --> 01:21:41.006
Or maybe gimmick's a better word.
One black, one white.

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:43.495
I made him promise he'll never
skate with anyone else.

01:21:43.496 --> 01:21:46.701
We were so good we didn't need
anything like that to get attention.

01:21:46.963 --> 01:21:48.804
The promise was made.

01:21:48.896 --> 01:21:50.668
Was that promise kept?

01:22:44.162 --> 01:22:49.231
Nicole, just tell me what it was like.

01:22:51.562 --> 01:22:55.767
What was it like to sleep in
an abandoned van on your...

01:22:56.062 --> 01:22:58.506
fourteenth birthday? Yeah?

01:23:00.062 --> 01:23:03.039
Does this remind you
of what it was like?

01:23:04.362 --> 01:23:07.094
Sorry if I got some
of the details wrong.

01:23:07.095 --> 01:23:10.436
But you didn't tell me what
colour the van was so...

01:23:10.796 --> 01:23:13.933
I found the yellow to be quite striking.

01:23:15.696 --> 01:23:26.004
Just tell me, is this anything like
what you experienced, is it?

01:23:28.763 --> 01:23:34.400
Start thinking of the details
or else I might not be back.

01:24:14.529 --> 01:24:17.336
Excuse me, you probably shouldn't...

01:24:22.295 --> 01:24:24.704
What other rooms do you work in?

01:24:24.962 --> 01:24:27.337
Every room on this floor.

01:24:31.362 --> 01:24:32.528
Hey, baby.

01:24:32.529 --> 01:24:34.895
I was wondering if you could
please come to the house?

01:24:34.896 --> 01:24:37.395
- Come home?
- We need to talk.

01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:39.365
Talk about what?

01:24:39.429 --> 01:24:40.804
Just come to the house.

01:24:40.863 --> 01:24:44.067
Okay. It's gonna take me a few hours.
I'm gonna be right there.

01:24:44.429 --> 01:24:46.634
- Three cameras found.
- Can't trace the uplink yet.

01:24:47.662 --> 01:24:49.901
- In all the rooms that Tina works?
- Yeah.

01:24:50.863 --> 01:24:54.863
- Alright, what's going on? Ideas?
- Yeah. Some kind of thrill crime.

01:24:55.262 --> 01:24:56.705
What's the thrill?

01:24:56.863 --> 01:24:58.495
Watching mummy twist.

01:24:58.496 --> 01:25:00.496
It's actually not a bad
idea for a reality show.

01:25:00.696 --> 01:25:02.894
Look it, it's out there, I know,
but listen, you got the kid.

01:25:02.895 --> 01:25:07.194
So why not watch the mother's pain
and confusion? A blank trophy.

01:25:07.195 --> 01:25:11.061
- A teacup. Throw in some baby teeth.
- A hairbrush. A pinwheel.

01:25:11.062 --> 01:25:12.328
Eight years after the abduction?

01:25:12.329 --> 01:25:13.894
Hey, they might have
been watching all along.

01:25:13.895 --> 01:25:16.498
The personality driven to abduct
the child, we're used to.

01:25:19.162 --> 01:25:21.662
Noticing a mother's quiet desperation.

01:25:22.962 --> 01:25:24.496
That's something else.

01:25:24.928 --> 01:25:26.561
What are you saying, Sam?

01:25:26.562 --> 01:25:30.495
There's a kidnapper
and there's a watcher.

01:25:30.496 --> 01:25:31.795
Or watchers.

01:25:31.796 --> 01:25:34.068
Maybe even subscribers.

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:36.297
A whole new class of freaks.

01:25:36.895 --> 01:25:38.372
Let's go.

01:25:44.062 --> 01:25:45.505
Hi.

01:25:48.562 --> 01:25:50.368
Hello, Matthew.

01:25:50.496 --> 01:25:52.166
What's going on?

01:25:52.596 --> 01:25:54.664
Let's talk for a minute.

01:25:55.962 --> 01:25:59.702
Well, I don't... I don't really
have anything to say.

01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:04.128
Please?

01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:17.072
Nicole thinks that they might be...

01:26:18.195 --> 01:26:20.297
they might be watching me.

01:26:22.362 --> 01:26:23.861
Who's watching you?

01:26:23.862 --> 01:26:26.896
It looks like the abductors
aren't so far out of the picture.

01:26:27.895 --> 01:26:30.737
Nicole found some cameras in
my rooms that were hidden.

01:26:30.995 --> 01:26:31.894
Why?

01:26:31.895 --> 01:26:34.600
We'd love any ideas you have about that.

01:26:34.696 --> 01:26:36.264
Well, I have no idea.

01:26:37.729 --> 01:26:42.229
Did you keep any of Case's teeth,
her baby teeth?

01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:45.061
What?

01:26:45.062 --> 01:26:47.561
Tina's found some baby teeth

01:26:47.562 --> 01:26:51.062
- and some other things in the rooms.
- Other things? What other things?

01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:55.299
A trophy. Like the one she won.

01:26:55.329 --> 01:26:57.204
The teeth?

01:26:57.828 --> 01:27:01.361
- Okay, are they hers?
- Why would you think they were hers?

01:27:01.362 --> 01:27:04.203
If they're not hers, then why the
fuck are we talking about them?

01:27:06.862 --> 01:27:09.567
I'm not saying... I'm not saying
anything else with this...

01:27:09.662 --> 01:27:12.230
Get outta my house. Go.

01:27:28.596 --> 01:27:30.266
What do you want from me?

01:27:31.562 --> 01:27:35.198
The teeth were placed in the rooms,

01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:36.994
under the pillows.

01:27:36.995 --> 01:27:38.661
I found them like they were
left for the Tooth Fairy.

01:27:38.662 --> 01:27:40.730
You know, like we used
to do with Cassie.

01:27:41.162 --> 01:27:43.027
Have you asked the Tooth Fairy?

01:27:43.028 --> 01:27:45.661
- Do you think this is funny?
- Yeah. A little. I do. How...

01:27:45.662 --> 01:27:47.332
how long has this been going on, hon?

01:27:47.728 --> 01:27:49.830
How come no one's told me?

01:27:49.962 --> 01:27:54.063
Tina, why tell me, right?
Why ask for my help.

01:27:54.164 --> 01:27:57.198
You guys are doing great on your own.
It's only been eight years.

01:27:57.295 --> 01:28:00.361
You people can't even do your job.
All you can do is turn my wife against me.

01:28:00.362 --> 01:28:03.328
Tina, do you think that I did this?
Is that what you think? That I went in there,

01:28:03.329 --> 01:28:07.897
I put a bunch of... cameras in there?
And then... and what? And what?

01:28:14.095 --> 01:28:15.867
Tina.

01:28:20.129 --> 01:28:23.695
Mr. Lane, is there something
you're not telling us?

01:28:24.295 --> 01:28:27.238
No! No!

01:28:27.995 --> 01:28:29.595
So now what?

01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:32.073
You gonna arrest me?
Go ahead, please do it.

01:28:32.362 --> 01:28:36.828
Please. If you think that I did this, you...
you come here and you arrest me.

01:28:58.629 --> 01:29:00.128
What's with the shrine here, man?

01:29:18.928 --> 01:29:21.497
It's just there's so
many people from before.

01:29:21.728 --> 01:29:26.195
There's Jill from my soccer team.
My best friend, Karen. Albert.

01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:30.036
And now that I can't see
my mum anymore I need...

01:29:30.095 --> 01:29:33.129
new experiences.
I need to feel inspired.

01:29:35.229 --> 01:29:36.794
Oh, yeah.

01:29:36.795 --> 01:29:40.171
Do you remember that story
I told you about the trophy?

01:29:40.628 --> 01:29:43.765
About the moment I skated over to
my mother and handed it to her?

01:29:44.529 --> 01:29:47.131
Remember how moved you were?

01:29:48.062 --> 01:29:50.130
I want to feel that.

01:29:50.762 --> 01:29:53.762
You told me it was the best
story I ever told you.

01:29:54.995 --> 01:29:56.767
It was.

01:29:57.529 --> 01:29:59.972
So why don't we make it even better?

01:30:02.795 --> 01:30:04.398
How?

01:30:24.329 --> 01:30:27.461
I'm just wondering if you kept
that trophy or if Cass kept it.

01:30:27.462 --> 01:30:29.761
- What's this for?
- It's just for an article I'm writing about

01:30:29.762 --> 01:30:33.128
children who disappear and the impact
that it has years later on the...

01:30:33.129 --> 01:30:35.027
This article sounds
like fucking bullshit.

01:30:35.028 --> 01:30:37.395
- No, it's not. It's very serious...
- What, you come here eight years later

01:30:37.396 --> 01:30:38.627
and then bring up Cass?

01:30:38.628 --> 01:30:41.727
I'm just wondering about the impact that
it had on your life. I'm wondering...

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:43.961
Yeah, it impacted my life.
What do you want to know?

01:30:43.962 --> 01:30:45.528
I want to know about this
trophy that you won.

01:30:45.529 --> 01:30:47.562
- I wondered if you kept it.
- No. No.

01:30:48.262 --> 01:30:49.994
I'm done. No, this is fucking bullshit.

01:30:49.995 --> 01:30:52.473
- Did you keep the trophy?
- Yeah, I kept the fucking trophy.

01:30:53.062 --> 01:30:54.495
Okay. I can...
I can see that you're upset.

01:30:54.496 --> 01:30:56.027
- I won't ask you any more questions.
- Great. Are we done?

01:30:56.028 --> 01:30:58.869
- Yeah. Thank you very much for your time.
- Awesome. Thank you so much.

01:31:17.595 --> 01:31:18.902
Albert?

01:31:19.928 --> 01:31:21.132
Who's that?

01:31:21.462 --> 01:31:24.030
Some creepy bitch asking about Cass.

01:33:23.329 --> 01:33:25.161
- Yeah?
- I don't know who's in charge here anymore.

01:33:25.162 --> 01:33:28.228
I used to deal with Nicole Dunlop.
'kay... This is urgent.

01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:30.660
- Who is this?
- Matthew Lane.

01:33:30.661 --> 01:33:31.894
Matthew Lane.

01:33:31.895 --> 01:33:35.261
- Case's father. Cass Lane.
- Yeah, I know who you are, Matthew.

01:33:35.262 --> 01:33:37.994
I've found them. Those people who
took my daughter, I found them.

01:33:37.995 --> 01:33:39.801
They're at a diner on Route 15.

01:33:39.828 --> 01:33:42.135
You been watching a lot
of movies, lately, Matthew?

01:33:42.661 --> 01:33:46.832
Listen to me.
These people have my daughter.

01:33:46.928 --> 01:33:50.201
I've seen her. I've been...
I've been with her.

01:33:51.561 --> 01:33:53.367
She's alive.

01:33:54.595 --> 01:33:57.360
Hey. I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

01:33:57.361 --> 01:34:00.660
I have a phone and the phone has GPS.
I'm gonna plant it on their car.

01:34:00.661 --> 01:34:01.727
I'll give you the number.

01:34:01.728 --> 01:34:04.228
I'm gonna plant it on their car
and then you can track it.

01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:08.769
And then you can find them in case
something happens to me, okay?

01:34:42.162 --> 01:34:45.434
Do you mind if I...
if I ask you a few questions?

01:34:45.728 --> 01:34:48.137
- About what?
- About Cass Lane.

01:34:48.795 --> 01:34:52.161
- Okay.
- Yeah, I... I'm writing an article about...

01:34:52.162 --> 01:34:55.494
children who disappear and the effect
that it has on the people in their lives.

01:34:55.495 --> 01:34:57.166
Yeah.

01:34:58.695 --> 01:35:02.230
- Just got a call from Matthew Lane.
- Yeah, I overheard you.

01:35:02.828 --> 01:35:04.828
What is it with you and that guy?

01:35:08.262 --> 01:35:10.636
Says he met this guy at a diner.

01:35:10.895 --> 01:35:13.560
Thinks he's the one that
stole his daughter.

01:35:13.561 --> 01:35:16.039
So he tossed his cell
phone in the guy's car.

01:35:17.328 --> 01:35:18.828
Want me to check it out?

01:35:20.262 --> 01:35:21.670
Yeah.

01:35:31.361 --> 01:35:33.361
Hey! Put that back!

01:35:33.495 --> 01:35:36.871
- It's my daughter.
- I don't care who it is, I said put it back!

01:35:39.428 --> 01:35:41.327
Do you want me to call the cops?

01:35:41.328 --> 01:35:43.305
Yeah, I want you to call the cops.

01:35:43.661 --> 01:35:45.968
Do it. Do it.

01:36:09.062 --> 01:36:10.766
Have you seen this girl?

01:36:12.228 --> 01:36:16.172
I lost her a few miles from here,
at a diner just like this one.

01:36:17.129 --> 01:36:18.935
That's awful.

01:36:20.661 --> 01:36:22.729
Yeah, it's awful.

01:36:24.129 --> 01:36:27.435
I went in to get a and I
came out and she was gone.

01:36:27.928 --> 01:36:29.598
Just like that.

01:36:30.528 --> 01:36:31.994
Eight years ago.

01:36:31.995 --> 01:36:34.631
I've spent... I've spent
eight years looking for her.

01:36:37.195 --> 01:36:38.899
Without a trace?

01:36:43.194 --> 01:36:44.899
Without a trace.

01:36:47.261 --> 01:36:49.636
Isn't that an awful story?

01:36:50.361 --> 01:36:54.669
Well, isn't that an awful story?

01:36:59.895 --> 01:37:01.565
You know something?

01:37:02.129 --> 01:37:04.527
The police think that I had
something to do with it.

01:37:04.528 --> 01:37:06.131
That maybe I sold her.

01:37:07.162 --> 01:37:10.003
- Sold her to who?
- To monsters.

01:37:12.461 --> 01:37:14.302
How could I do that?

01:37:15.294 --> 01:37:17.128
I'm her father. I'm her dad.

01:37:17.129 --> 01:37:20.027
I... I'm supposed to protect her.
I'm the one that loves her.

01:37:20.028 --> 01:37:21.698
Of course you do.

01:37:22.528 --> 01:37:25.097
I miss my daughter so much.

01:37:28.161 --> 01:37:31.832
- I called the police. Now get outta here.
- You called the police?

01:37:34.095 --> 01:37:37.027
The police, they're a
useless bunch of...

01:37:37.028 --> 01:37:39.094
They're... they're the real
monsters here, the police.

01:37:39.095 --> 01:37:42.727
They're all in this together with the
judges and the lawyers and the priests

01:37:42.728 --> 01:37:45.637
and all those people that
we're supposed to trust.

01:37:51.895 --> 01:37:53.838
They know where Cass is.

01:37:55.128 --> 01:37:57.435
They're all the ones
that are hiding her.

01:38:26.261 --> 01:38:28.170
He took my phone.

01:40:12.061 --> 01:40:13.436
Fuck!

01:40:25.061 --> 01:40:26.766
Fuck. Fuck!

01:40:29.161 --> 01:40:30.764
Fuck!

01:41:29.495 --> 01:41:31.903
Hey! Hey!

01:42:14.927 --> 01:42:17.371
We just have to go somewhere.

01:42:30.361 --> 01:42:31.929
Put her down!

01:42:33.795 --> 01:42:35.397
Freeze!

01:42:45.795 --> 01:42:47.294
Freeze!

01:42:47.595 --> 01:42:49.128
Don't move!

01:42:49.695 --> 01:42:53.035
Don't move or I'll shoot! Don't move!

01:43:13.294 --> 01:43:14.964
Where is she?

01:43:15.495 --> 01:43:19.200
Where's Nicole? Answer me!

01:43:23.461 --> 01:43:25.597
Where, where, where?

01:43:26.728 --> 01:43:31.460
A van. Where she had
her fourteenth birthday

01:43:31.461 --> 01:43:33.260
Fourteenth birthday?
What the hell are you talking about?

01:43:33.261 --> 01:43:35.060
Where's the van, man? Where is it?

01:43:35.061 --> 01:43:37.368
You know we're gonna
find it, now tell us!

01:43:37.461 --> 01:43:39.995
Where's the van? Where is it?

01:43:40.094 --> 01:43:42.971
Just tell us where it is. Where is it?!

01:44:20.461 --> 01:44:22.165
Cassie?

01:44:24.428 --> 01:44:25.961
Daddy...

01:44:26.328 --> 01:44:27.736
Baby!

01:45:11.727 --> 01:45:14.637
All those years,
you guys wouldn't let up.

01:45:15.328 --> 01:45:19.394
It wasn't just for you,
you know, it was for Nicole too.

01:45:19.395 --> 01:45:21.065
For her spirit.

01:45:25.961 --> 01:45:28.234
It was really important for her.

01:45:29.428 --> 01:45:32.768
They'll find her. I know they will.

01:45:33.628 --> 01:45:36.105
Your team is so smart.
