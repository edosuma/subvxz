00:39.278 --> 00:40.529
<i>Gotham City.</i>

00:40.696 --> 00:44.742
<i>Clean shafts of concrete
and snowy rooftops.</i>

00:44.909 --> 00:48.162
<i>The work of men
who died generations ago.</i>

00:49.205 --> 00:52.667
<i>From here, it looks like an achievement.</i>

00:54.001 --> 00:57.964
<i>From here, you can't see the enemy.</i>

01:06.514 --> 01:08.933
Hey. Hey, buddy, slow down.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.102
- You're talking to me?
Yeah, you almost...

01:11.269 --> 01:12.728
<i>Twelve hours.</i>

01:12.895 --> 01:15.481
<i>Train's no way to come to the city.</i>

01:17.024 --> 01:18.651
- Knock it off.
- Hey, watch it.

01:19.235 --> 01:20.945
<i>Thank God Barbara's flying in.</i>

01:21.112 --> 01:23.531
<i>She should have gotten
the tests back by now.</i>

01:23.698 --> 01:27.618
<i>I only hate myself a little
for hoping they came out negative.</i>

01:27.785 --> 01:30.162
<i>This is no place to raise a family.</i>

01:34.500 --> 01:37.670
<i>Maybe Gotham's all I deserve now.</i>

01:38.254 --> 01:41.090
<i>Maybe it's just my time in hell.</i>

01:56.105 --> 01:59.025
Nice book for a small donation.

02:01.861 --> 02:03.487
Nice book for a small donation.

02:03.654 --> 02:04.780
No, please.

02:04.947 --> 02:07.533
Nice book. Look at the picture... Aah!

02:07.950 --> 02:10.286
They don't know when to quit,
do they, lieutenant?

02:10.453 --> 02:12.663
Name's Flass. Detective Flass.

02:12.830 --> 02:14.874
Commissioner Loeb sent me to meet you.

02:15.041 --> 02:17.793
He wanted to make sure
you didn't miss your appointment.

02:21.255 --> 02:23.132
Welcome to Gotham, lieutenant.

02:23.299 --> 02:25.217
Don't worry. Not as bad as it looks.

02:25.384 --> 02:26.677
Especially if you're a cop.

02:27.887 --> 02:30.431
Cops got it made it Gotham.

02:35.269 --> 02:36.729
Are we rolling?

02:36.896 --> 02:39.273
Sir, a moment of your time.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.776
Welcome home, Mr. Wayne.
How's it feel to be back?

02:41.943 --> 02:43.444
What are your plans, Mr. Wayne?

02:43.611 --> 02:46.489
Mr. Wayne, Princess Caroline,
any truth to the rumors?

02:46.656 --> 02:48.532
Mr. Wayne, please,
can you look over here?

02:48.699 --> 02:50.826
The 25-year-old heir
to the Wayne millions...

02:50.993 --> 02:53.955
...declined to comment on his return home
after 12 years abroad.

02:54.121 --> 02:58.209
<i>We'll keep you posted on Gotham's richest
and best looking native son.</i>

02:58.376 --> 02:59.835
<i>- Tom?
- Thank you, Vicky.</i>

03:00.002 --> 03:01.754
<i>Vicky Vale at Gotham Airport.</i>

03:01.921 --> 03:05.216
<i>In other news, conspiracy charges against
Police Commissioner Loeb...</i>

03:05.383 --> 03:08.511
<i>...were withdrawn today after
the disappearance of a key witness.</i>

03:09.679 --> 03:11.681
Lieutenant James Gordon.

03:12.515 --> 03:14.850
Impressive. Very impressive.

03:15.309 --> 03:17.687
We're delighted to have you
on the team, lieutenant.

03:18.104 --> 03:20.189
You'll get my best work, sir. I promise.

03:20.356 --> 03:21.357
I know I will.

03:21.524 --> 03:24.151
And we are a team, Gordon. A team.

03:24.318 --> 03:28.614
Any team needs to play together
in order to win, don't you think?

03:28.781 --> 03:30.116
Yes, it does.

03:30.283 --> 03:33.202
Your record shows
you've got what it takes.

03:33.369 --> 03:35.371
I know I've made my mistakes, sir.

03:35.538 --> 03:37.582
What mistakes did you make, lieutenant?

03:38.040 --> 03:40.042
You kept the media away from it.

03:40.209 --> 03:43.045
That's all that matters, isn't it? Yes, it is.

03:43.379 --> 03:46.299
You won't have to worry
about my honesty, commissioner.

03:46.465 --> 03:48.884
Last thing on my mind.

03:49.051 --> 03:50.886
Last thing.

04:16.077 --> 04:20.124
Welcome home, Master Bruce.
- Thank you, Alfred.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.253
It's good to be back.

04:34.180 --> 04:37.099
I knew you'd like the commissioner.
He's a stand-up guy.

04:37.266 --> 04:40.811
And he'll be just as good to you
as you are to him. Count on it.

04:41.270 --> 04:43.147
Yeah, I got that feeling.

04:49.987 --> 04:53.449
- Flass.
Nothing I can't handle, lieutenant.

04:54.992 --> 04:57.119
Hey, Stevie, mother know you're here?

04:57.286 --> 04:58.621
Oh, crap.

05:01.457 --> 05:03.084
<i>He's got a Green Beret's training.</i>

05:04.794 --> 05:06.337
<i>He knows how to use his size too.</i>

05:07.421 --> 05:09.507
<i>Don't do a damn thing.</i>

05:10.258 --> 05:14.053
<i>Be sure of your facts
before you bring down another cop.</i>

05:14.595 --> 05:16.180
<i>Just watch him.</i>

05:16.806 --> 05:18.641
<i>Memorize every move.</i>

05:19.809 --> 05:21.560
<i>For future reference.</i>

05:25.690 --> 05:27.024
Was that necessary?

05:27.191 --> 05:29.652
Had this little beauty in his pocket.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.989
It's a comb, Flass.

05:33.489 --> 05:35.408
Hey, I'm only human, Jimmy.

05:35.575 --> 05:37.660
Mind if I call you Jimmy?

05:50.923 --> 05:52.341
<i>Twelve years.</i>

05:52.508 --> 05:55.177
<i>And the ache is still fresh.</i>

05:55.344 --> 05:57.847
<i>Like a raw angry nerve.</i>

06:02.768 --> 06:05.021
<i>But this isn't about healing.</i>

06:05.187 --> 06:07.899
<i>I'm not looking for closure.</i>

06:17.825 --> 06:20.411
The boys, Jimmy.
They've been asking me to talk to you.

06:20.953 --> 06:22.705
They're worried about you.

06:22.872 --> 06:25.374
I mean, you with a baby
on the way and all.

06:25.541 --> 06:27.960
- Call me lieutenant.
- Yeah, sure thing, Jimmy.

06:28.127 --> 06:29.795
You gotta learn to relax.

06:29.962 --> 06:33.174
See, we got our own way of doing things
here in Gotham.

06:42.391 --> 06:45.937
This job can get to you, Jimmy.
That's why we gotta stick together.

06:46.103 --> 06:48.231
The boys need to know
they can count on you.

06:50.650 --> 06:53.402
We can count on you, right?

07:19.637 --> 07:21.764
Hey. Everything okay?

07:25.434 --> 07:27.311
It is now.

07:43.077 --> 07:44.954
<i>I'm not ready.</i>

07:45.121 --> 07:47.707
<i>I have the means, the skill...</i>

07:54.589 --> 07:56.799
<i>But something's missing.</i>

07:58.968 --> 08:00.970
<i>I have to wait.</i>

08:02.680 --> 08:04.807
<i>I have to wait.</i>

08:11.355 --> 08:14.483
And Gordon,
he looks at the 50 like it's diseased.

08:14.650 --> 08:16.485
Then throws it in the padre's face.

08:16.652 --> 08:20.031
Gives the entire squad
a two-hour lecture on ethics.

08:20.197 --> 08:21.824
Put Schell on probation.

08:21.991 --> 08:25.328
I'm telling you, Gill,
he's just not fitting in.

08:26.787 --> 08:30.499
I had such high hopes for that boy.

08:37.006 --> 08:40.051
<i>I requested off this
damn night shift four times now.</i>

08:40.509 --> 08:42.178
<i>Barbara needs me.</i>

08:42.345 --> 08:44.221
<i>Barbara and little James.</i>

08:44.388 --> 08:46.349
<i>So I hope it's a boy, so what?</i>

08:46.807 --> 08:49.018
Going to work, lieutenant?

08:53.522 --> 08:56.901
You're gonna be a little late.
May have to skip the whole night.

09:02.823 --> 09:04.784
<i>I was taught to handle worse than this.</i>

09:04.951 --> 09:05.993
<i>But then...</i>

09:08.204 --> 09:09.914
<i>It's been a while.</i>

09:22.677 --> 09:25.721
Consider this a warning. Be smart.

09:26.555 --> 09:29.392
Think of that pregnant wife of yours,
Jimmy.

09:46.951 --> 09:48.578
<i>This is reconnaissance mission.</i>

09:49.412 --> 09:53.416
<i>Until I'm ready,
my anonymity is an obvious priority.</i>

09:53.583 --> 09:56.919
<i>All it requires is a change of clothing
and complexion.</i>

09:57.086 --> 10:01.090
<i>And a single memorable
distracting detail.</i>

10:03.968 --> 10:06.596
<i>It's a 20-block walk to the enemy camp.</i>

10:06.762 --> 10:08.222
<i>The East End.</i>

10:18.858 --> 10:21.611
<i>Hard to believe it's gotten worse.</i>

10:24.405 --> 10:26.449
Cheer you up, mister?

10:29.952 --> 10:33.497
- How old are you?
- Young as you want me to be.

10:33.664 --> 10:36.042
Stupid little bitch.
You're doing it all wrong.

10:36.208 --> 10:39.045
- But I did what you said.
- Get on out of here.

10:39.211 --> 10:41.797
- We'll talk this over later.
No.

10:41.964 --> 10:43.799
I think you're finished with her.

10:45.092 --> 10:48.804
Man, that crazy vet thing is old.
You stink like vice.

10:48.971 --> 10:51.807
I'm not the police. Believe me.

10:53.976 --> 10:56.520
Selina, don't stop now.

10:57.313 --> 10:59.190
He can't be vice. We're paid up.

10:59.357 --> 11:01.776
Selina, what are you doing?

11:01.943 --> 11:05.655
Watching some idiot
trying to get himself killed.

11:06.864 --> 11:08.282
Man, you're pushing.

11:08.449 --> 11:11.494
You're looking for a new scar.
Just tell me where you want it.

11:20.586 --> 11:22.505
Come on. Get him.

12:02.628 --> 12:04.338
Freeze.

12:12.471 --> 12:14.724
Jeez, Eddie, why did you shoot?
He didn't move.

12:15.433 --> 12:17.393
He was going to.

12:22.607 --> 12:24.734
- Any cash?
Couple of bucks.

12:24.901 --> 12:26.694
No ID.

12:28.154 --> 12:32.116
Oh, he's bleeding all over the backseat.
What if he dies?

12:32.283 --> 12:36.120
So, what if he does?
One less mouth to feed at the soup kitchen.

12:36.287 --> 12:37.455
You two.

12:37.622 --> 12:39.916
Stop the car. Get out.

12:40.082 --> 12:41.250
What the hell?

12:41.417 --> 12:44.211
Don't mind him.
Probably hopped up on something.

13:08.778 --> 13:10.738
<i>Scum maybe.</i>

13:10.905 --> 13:13.783
<i>But even scum have families.</i>

13:37.765 --> 13:40.017
<i>Detective Flass is off duty, lieutenant.</i>

13:40.184 --> 13:43.646
<i>He and the guys have a poker party
every Wednesday night over at Chutes.</i>

14:16.762 --> 14:19.932
No. I said posse.

14:20.850 --> 14:22.893
See you guys tomorrow.

15:37.426 --> 15:39.428
Hello, Jimmy.

15:42.807 --> 15:46.185
<i>It's been years
since I had to take out a Green Beret.</i>

15:46.352 --> 15:50.606
<i>Even so, he deserves a handicap.</i>

16:17.550 --> 16:18.968
<i>He'll never report it.</i>

16:19.135 --> 16:20.469
<i>Not Flass.</i>

16:20.636 --> 16:23.848
<i>He'll make up some story
that involves at least 10 attackers.</i>

16:28.227 --> 16:29.645
<i>But he'll know.</i>

16:30.688 --> 16:33.274
<i>And he'll stay away from Barbara.</i>

16:55.129 --> 16:57.798
<i>I've tried to be patient.</i>

16:57.965 --> 16:59.717
<i>I've tried to wait.</i>

17:00.259 --> 17:02.011
<i>But I have to know.</i>

17:02.178 --> 17:04.347
<i>How, Father?</i>

17:04.512 --> 17:05.932
<i>How do I do it?</i>

17:06.098 --> 17:10.519
<i>What do I use to make them afraid?</i>

17:12.021 --> 17:15.523
<i>If I ring the bell, Alfred will come.</i>

17:15.691 --> 17:19.028
<i>Another of your gifts to me, Father.</i>

17:19.779 --> 17:24.659
<i>But I'd rather die than wait another hour.</i>

17:25.034 --> 17:28.788
<i>I've already waited 18 years.</i>

18:13.624 --> 18:19.755
<i>Eighteen years
since all sense left my life.</i>

18:48.784 --> 18:50.786
<i>Yes, Father.</i>

19:06.886 --> 19:08.971
<i>He's held four children at gun point.</i>

19:09.138 --> 19:11.390
<i>Reportedly he has a history
of mental illness.</i>

19:11.557 --> 19:14.101
<i>SWAT team lead by Brendon
has just arrived...</i>

19:14.268 --> 19:15.478
<i>Crap. Brendon?</i>

19:15.645 --> 19:17.313
<i>Lt'll be a massacre.</i>

19:20.816 --> 19:24.737
<i>Last month, he and his lunatic gestapo
calmed down a riot in Robinson Park.</i>

19:24.904 --> 19:27.657
<i>He didn't even leave
the statues standing.</i>

19:34.664 --> 19:36.123
No. Don't want.

19:36.290 --> 19:38.000
Isn't blank.

19:38.167 --> 19:41.003
Damn it, Merkel. I'm not here to argue,
I'm here to clean up.

19:41.170 --> 19:43.673
Lieutenant Gordon is on his way, sir.
I really think...

19:43.839 --> 19:46.342
To hell with that spineless bastard.
Now stand aside.

19:51.889 --> 19:54.725
Go find your own war, Brendon.
I'll take it from here.

20:10.241 --> 20:13.869
<i>Intense hostage situation in midtown,
at the corner of Richmond and Todd...</i>

20:14.036 --> 20:17.373
<i>...we're getting reports that the gunman
has history of mental illness...</i>

20:17.540 --> 20:20.751
<i>...and was apparently released
from Arkham Asylum.</i>

20:36.517 --> 20:37.685
Take it easy, friend.

20:37.852 --> 20:39.854
No. Defibrillate.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.231
No lunch. No lunch.

20:42.398 --> 20:45.276
It's okay, pal. We'll order out.

20:45.443 --> 20:47.361
No lunch. No gangrene lunch.

21:08.633 --> 21:10.718
Who wants gum?

21:11.761 --> 21:14.055
You really handled that well, Brendon.

21:14.597 --> 21:16.933
What was I suppose to do?
Disobey a direct order?

21:17.350 --> 21:20.561
- Something's gotta be done.
- I'd like nothing better.

21:20.728 --> 21:22.438
But we must be patient.

21:22.605 --> 21:27.151
Gordon has the press on his side.
He's a hero.

21:54.553 --> 21:56.180
<i>I hate the job.</i>

21:57.723 --> 21:59.225
<i>I hate the gun.</i>

22:00.643 --> 22:02.979
<i>But I keep practicing.</i>

22:07.316 --> 22:09.735
<i>How did I let this happen?</i>

22:12.280 --> 22:14.407
<i>To bring an innocent child to life.</i>

22:15.241 --> 22:17.660
<i>In a city without hope.</i>

22:31.716 --> 22:34.385
I could use a jackhammer on your back.

22:34.552 --> 22:35.928
Oh. You're doing fine, honey.

22:38.681 --> 22:40.182
Ignore it.

22:41.893 --> 22:43.185
Hello?

22:43.352 --> 22:45.187
<i>I'm sorry, Mrs. Gordon...</i>

22:47.815 --> 22:49.317
It's Merkel at the station.

22:49.483 --> 22:51.944
Something about a giant bat.

22:52.445 --> 22:54.363
The chicken'll keep.

23:35.071 --> 23:36.906
<i>Amateur.</i>

23:37.073 --> 23:38.950
<i>Lucky amateur.</i>

23:41.035 --> 23:42.912
Some of you know Detective Essen.

23:43.079 --> 23:46.916
She has returned to Gotham from Lakeside
to help with our investigation.

23:51.254 --> 23:53.214
Okay, okay. Listen up.

23:53.381 --> 23:57.802
Our vigilante, or Batman,
as the news shows are calling him...

23:57.969 --> 24:01.097
...has committed 70 assaults
in the past five weeks.

24:01.264 --> 24:04.016
Now during this time,
certain patterns have emerged.

24:04.433 --> 24:05.601
Thank you, detective.

24:05.768 --> 24:08.854
He operates between the hours of midnight
and 4 a. m.

24:09.021 --> 24:11.190
Concentrating his efforts
in the East End.

24:11.357 --> 24:14.110
This Batman is working his way up
the crime ladder.

24:14.277 --> 24:17.113
From junkie to pusher to supplier.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.657
No one appears safe. Not even cops.

24:19.824 --> 24:23.536
- Right, Detective Flass?
- He's not human.

24:26.372 --> 24:27.832
Gentlemen.

24:27.999 --> 24:30.084
Why don't you tell us what happened.

24:30.251 --> 24:31.877
And try not to exaggerate.

24:32.420 --> 24:35.172
It's like I said in my report.

24:35.339 --> 24:39.635
<i>I received an anonymous tip leading me
to an East End cocaine delivery.</i>

24:39.802 --> 24:42.805
<i>I was on the process of single-handedly
apprehending the felons.</i>

24:42.972 --> 24:46.642
<i>It came out of the night sky.
Wings 30 feet across.</i>

24:47.977 --> 24:52.231
<i>One of the felons I have not yet disarmed,
produced a gun, fired point blank...</i>

24:52.398 --> 24:55.610
<i>...bullet passed right through
the creature like it wasn't there.</i>

24:56.068 --> 24:58.905
<i>Something flew from its hand.
Little dart things.</i>

24:59.071 --> 25:01.699
<i>Paralyzed everyone. Except me.</i>

25:01.866 --> 25:04.410
It singled me out. It had claws.

25:04.577 --> 25:06.203
I'm telling you it isn't human.

25:06.370 --> 25:08.623
Gentlemen, please.

25:27.975 --> 25:30.144
Have you seen Batman, commissioner?

25:30.311 --> 25:32.021
They say he's huge.

25:32.188 --> 25:33.814
You shouldn't pry, Marian.

25:33.981 --> 25:36.192
Gill has his hands full these days.

25:36.359 --> 25:40.321
We're trusting him
to cope with Batman and Gordon.

25:40.488 --> 25:45.034
Whoever this bat person is, he's a having
a positive effect on public spirit.

25:45.201 --> 25:47.495
Street crime has dropped significantly.

25:47.662 --> 25:50.081
Hell, Gill, maybe you ought
to offer him a job.

25:52.917 --> 25:55.127
Hey, hey, let's not kid ourselves.

25:55.294 --> 25:57.463
Batman is costing us all money.

25:57.630 --> 26:00.049
Two sides to everything, friends.

26:00.216 --> 26:01.634
Look at the long term.

26:01.801 --> 26:05.137
A few street operators
are put out of action, yes...

26:05.304 --> 26:07.848
...but the people of Gotham have a hero.

26:08.015 --> 26:09.392
Makes them feel safe.

26:09.559 --> 26:13.896
And the safer they feel,
the fewer questions they ask, right, Gill?

26:21.445 --> 26:24.156
I don't like it. It's stirring things up.

26:24.574 --> 26:28.035
And with Gordon pushing Internal Affairs
to go after Flass...

26:28.202 --> 26:30.246
...Flass would be difficult to replace.

26:30.413 --> 26:33.791
- And if he were to talk...
- Let me worry about Flass.

26:35.376 --> 26:39.213
Relax, Carmine.
I got everything under control.

26:43.968 --> 26:47.096
- What is going on?
- The lights? What happened to the lights?

26:51.767 --> 26:54.061
Ladies, gentlemen...

26:54.562 --> 26:56.147
...you've eaten well.

26:56.314 --> 26:58.608
You've eaten Gotham's wealth.

26:58.774 --> 26:59.942
Its spirit.

27:00.109 --> 27:02.612
But your feast is nearly over.

27:03.779 --> 27:08.993
From this moment on,
none of you are safe.

27:10.953 --> 27:12.288
No excuses.

27:12.455 --> 27:15.750
That vigilante bastard
goes under, instantly.

27:15.917 --> 27:18.377
Or it's your job.

27:29.597 --> 27:31.557
<i>She knows how to walk in heels.</i>

27:32.058 --> 27:34.101
<i>So few women do these days.</i>

27:35.937 --> 27:37.563
<i>And she knows how to scream.</i>

27:39.148 --> 27:41.609
<i>You could hear it from the rooftops.</i>

27:43.361 --> 27:47.365
<i>Gordon is wasting a lot of manpower
on these traps.</i>

27:58.834 --> 28:00.628
We'll try again tomorrow night.

28:25.361 --> 28:28.030
Mr. Falcone, your Rolls, it's gone.

28:28.197 --> 28:30.658
He took it. Said it's in the river.

28:30.825 --> 28:32.702
Thinks he's a damn Robin Hood.

28:33.369 --> 28:35.538
He dies.

28:37.873 --> 28:40.251
He knows when and where
we sets our traps for him...

28:40.418 --> 28:43.879
...and night after nights, he terrorizes
the most powerful men in Gotham.

28:44.046 --> 28:47.800
- Heard what he did to the Roman's car?
- Laughed myself silly.

28:47.967 --> 28:49.302
A Rolls-Royce.

28:49.468 --> 28:51.971
You've been after the Roman for years.

28:52.138 --> 28:55.224
Some of your witnesses
changed their testimony. Others vanished.

28:55.391 --> 28:57.560
- Must be frustrating.
- Oh, yes.

28:57.727 --> 29:00.521
- Do you mind?
- Go for it.

29:01.647 --> 29:05.192
I understand he used his muscle
to keep you from making DA.

29:08.821 --> 29:12.450
- You keep in shape, don't you, Mr. Dent?
- What are you driving at, lieutenant?

29:13.451 --> 29:16.954
I need to know where you were
on the following dates.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.875
Thank you, sir.

29:29.050 --> 29:30.760
I thought he'd never leave.

29:30.927 --> 29:33.012
You can come out now.

29:44.106 --> 29:46.400
He had an alibi for every date, Essen.

29:46.567 --> 29:49.070
Says he was home
between midnight and 4 with his wife.

29:49.237 --> 29:50.529
No point in questioning her.

29:50.696 --> 29:53.699
- You really think he's Batman, lieutenant?
- It's possible.

29:53.866 --> 29:55.743
Dent certainly is passionate enough.

29:55.910 --> 29:58.955
But it takes more than muscles
to fight the way Batman does.

29:59.121 --> 30:00.706
And to get around the way he does.

30:00.873 --> 30:03.459
And those weapons?
I mean, he's got an arsenal.

30:03.876 --> 30:07.171
Hard to afford on a blue-collar salary.

30:07.338 --> 30:09.048
- Money, lieutenant.
- Hmm?

30:09.215 --> 30:11.592
Bruce Wayne
is the richest man in Gotham.

30:11.759 --> 30:13.928
Being from out of town,
you might not know...

30:14.095 --> 30:17.431
...but Wayne's parents were murdered,
by a mugger, I think.

30:17.974 --> 30:20.142
He was just a little boy at the time.

30:20.309 --> 30:21.978
Essen, I could kiss you.

30:22.144 --> 30:23.354
Jim.

30:28.484 --> 30:30.152
Hold on.

30:36.742 --> 30:38.536
Take the wheel.

30:55.344 --> 30:57.221
Don't move.

30:57.597 --> 31:00.141
Lieutenant, you all right?
I called for back-up.

31:00.683 --> 31:01.934
Essen.

31:04.145 --> 31:06.314
Stop. Or I'll...

31:10.943 --> 31:13.654
It's Batman. He went down that alley.

31:22.622 --> 31:24.332
Get the front of that place covered.

31:24.498 --> 31:28.127
Merkel, take a squad to the roof
No one fires without my order.

31:41.891 --> 31:44.977
Batman hasn't attacked anybody.
There's no need for Brendon.

31:45.144 --> 31:46.646
I've got the situation in hand.

32:01.118 --> 32:02.245
Oh, no.

32:02.411 --> 32:03.579
Everybody, back.

32:03.746 --> 32:05.206
- Move it back.
- Move, move, move.

32:05.373 --> 32:07.250
Clear the area.

33:00.511 --> 33:01.971
Selina.

33:02.138 --> 33:04.181
Selina, come see.

33:08.394 --> 33:11.022
Five in the morning? Come on, Holly.

33:11.188 --> 33:12.648
I'm serious, Selina.

33:12.815 --> 33:14.150
Things are blowing up.

33:14.650 --> 33:17.486
Brendon's probably cornered
some jaywalker.

33:17.653 --> 33:19.030
Turn on the TV.

33:19.196 --> 33:21.949
Gotta be something on about it.

33:35.546 --> 33:37.006
- Lock and load.
Brendon.

33:37.214 --> 33:40.760
Keep your men under control.
No one fires unless I say.

33:40.927 --> 33:44.222
Not this time, Gordon.
The commissioner wants a corpse.

33:44.388 --> 33:46.224
He's gonna get one.

33:47.934 --> 33:50.394
All units entering the target area.

33:50.561 --> 33:52.647
No prisoners, men.

33:57.526 --> 33:59.654
<i>Batman has been surrounded
by Gotham police...</i>

33:59.820 --> 34:02.281
<i>...inside an abandoned tenement
off Robinson Park.</i>

34:02.448 --> 34:04.075
Selina, it's Batman.

34:04.242 --> 34:06.535
- Can we?
- What the hell?

34:07.286 --> 34:08.871
Grab your coat.

34:11.873 --> 34:14.252
<i>Unit 1 reporting,
second floor's a mess.</i>

34:14.418 --> 34:15.710
<i>Nothing living.</i>

34:15.878 --> 34:19.297
<i>Unit 2 reporting, body under
the water-heater just an old wino.</i>

34:23.386 --> 34:26.556
If he made it down there,
he might have survived.

34:31.726 --> 34:33.437
Check it out.

34:56.043 --> 34:58.170
Super must have lived here.

34:58.879 --> 35:00.590
What the hell is going on?

35:01.549 --> 35:03.718
Open that goddamn door.

35:03.884 --> 35:06.304
<i>I like you right where you are, Brendon.</i>

35:06.429 --> 35:08.890
Too many people have already died.

35:09.056 --> 35:10.808
Order your squads to withdraw.

35:10.975 --> 35:13.144
<i>I can't guarantee their safety.</i>

35:13.311 --> 35:16.272
Units 1 and 2, converge on the lobby.
He's here.

35:16.439 --> 35:18.691
<i>Shoot on sight.</i>

35:24.822 --> 35:26.824
I need a mask.

35:29.076 --> 35:30.953
<i>Goddamn. Unit 1, do you read me?</i>

35:31.120 --> 35:32.955
Seems like Brendon is in trouble.

35:33.122 --> 35:35.708
I wish I could help, but orders are orders.

35:36.584 --> 35:37.877
It breaks my heart.

35:43.799 --> 35:45.885
Sir, he's taken out Unit 3.

35:46.052 --> 35:48.638
The entire unit, commissioner.

35:48.971 --> 35:51.891
You better shoot straight, son.

35:57.146 --> 35:58.648
<i>I've made a mess of things.</i>

35:59.190 --> 36:01.525
<i>Let it get out of hand.</i>

36:02.818 --> 36:04.528
Step it up. Step it up.

36:04.695 --> 36:07.990
Careful,
these stairs are about to give way.

36:13.204 --> 36:14.372
Hold your fire.

36:15.164 --> 36:16.457
It's a bat we're after.

36:19.627 --> 36:22.672
<i>With my belt gone,
I'm down to a blow gun.</i>

36:23.130 --> 36:28.219
<i>Three darts and an unofficial invention
of Wayne Electronics.</i>

36:31.389 --> 36:34.100
<i>Haven't tested it
for this great a distance.</i>

36:34.267 --> 36:37.770
<i>It took me weeks
to find the right ultrasonic tone.</i>

36:37.937 --> 36:41.023
<i>A tone that acts as an attractant.</i>

36:45.653 --> 36:48.197
Whoever Batman is, he's stronger than I...

36:48.364 --> 36:49.740
Shut up. He could be anywhere.

37:13.097 --> 37:14.891
Cease fire, you idiots.

37:28.112 --> 37:30.781
I'm gonna cut that bastard in half.

37:58.142 --> 37:59.977
Yeah.

38:01.479 --> 38:04.106
<i>They've made a hero out of him.</i>

38:53.823 --> 38:57.159
There, the motorcycle. After him.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.629
Shoot him, you idiot. Kill him.

39:08.796 --> 39:10.381
Kill him.

39:21.767 --> 39:23.227
I can't see a thing.

39:37.116 --> 39:38.993
<i>Every member of Brendon's team...</i>

39:39.160 --> 39:43.831
<i>...every cop and everybody in the crowd
were vaccinated for their bat bites.</i>

39:45.791 --> 39:49.629
<i>Never have so many had so much trouble
sitting down.</i>

39:51.255 --> 39:54.425
<i>Four of Brendon's men
were hospitalized with broken bones.</i>

39:54.592 --> 39:58.638
<i>Brendon himself suffered five broken ribs
and internal bleeding.</i>

39:59.055 --> 40:03.142
<i>The dead winos had no relatives
to complain about their fire bombing.</i>

40:03.309 --> 40:06.646
<i>Everyone who could have ordered
Brendon and Loeb up on charges...</i>

40:06.812 --> 40:11.234
<i>...remains unavailable to me
by appointment or telephone.</i>

40:12.109 --> 40:13.361
I spoke to his butler.

40:13.527 --> 40:16.280
Wayne has been skiing in Switzerland
for the past six weeks.

40:16.447 --> 40:20.451
Apparently, he took a nasty spill,
broke both legs and an arm.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.788
Cast on his arm and legs
would cover bullet wounds.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.332
Exactly where Batman received them.

40:26.499 --> 40:27.792
You're relentless, Essen.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.585
Only when I want something.

40:29.752 --> 40:31.295
Well, quitting time.

40:31.462 --> 40:33.798
- We'll pick it up tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

40:35.758 --> 40:36.842
Share a cab?

40:37.760 --> 40:39.136
Uh...

40:40.221 --> 40:41.681
Sure.

40:52.024 --> 40:54.110
Selina, you punched Stan.

40:54.318 --> 40:57.321
We're changing our line of work, Holly.

40:59.824 --> 41:00.992
Why a cop?

41:01.117 --> 41:04.328
I was told I was too masculine
for about six other careers.

41:04.495 --> 41:09.000
Whoever said you were masculine
must have been blind, deaf and dead.

41:11.669 --> 41:13.963
Mind if I ask you a personal question?

41:16.048 --> 41:17.508
I know why I'm here.

41:17.675 --> 41:21.679
But what are you doing here?
In Gotham, I mean.

41:22.889 --> 41:25.850
It's a long, sordid story.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.936
The bullet points are police corruption.

41:29.103 --> 41:31.314
A cop who wanted to believe
the system works...

41:31.480 --> 41:33.858
...and one incredibly bad decision.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.986
There's a reason
everyone hates Internal Affairs.

41:37.153 --> 41:39.697
They dangle the carrot
of integrity and honesty.

41:39.864 --> 41:42.867
But at the end of the day,
when you take down another cop...

41:43.034 --> 41:46.495
...they treat you
like any other low-life scumbag.

41:54.211 --> 41:56.005
I'm sorry.

42:28.204 --> 42:30.498
You spent the last of our money on that?

42:30.665 --> 42:32.416
It's not even Halloween.

42:32.917 --> 42:37.588
Sometimes, Holly,
you have to spend money to make money.

42:38.714 --> 42:40.758
Selina.

42:46.889 --> 42:49.183
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

42:51.811 --> 42:53.980
<i>I need to stop this thing with Sarah.</i>

42:54.146 --> 42:55.314
<i>Oh, God.</i>

42:55.481 --> 42:57.650
<i>Calling her Sarah now.</i>

42:58.067 --> 42:59.944
<i>I need to come clean with Barbara.</i>

43:00.111 --> 43:01.571
<i>Beg for forgiveness.</i>

43:02.446 --> 43:05.283
<i>But I can't stop thinking about her...</i>

43:05.449 --> 43:08.411
<i>...like I can't stop thinking
about this Batman.</i>

43:09.036 --> 43:11.247
<i>He's a criminal, I'm a cop.</i>

43:11.414 --> 43:12.999
<i>It's as simple as that.</i>

43:13.165 --> 43:17.295
<i>But I'm a cop in a city
that uses its cops like hired killers.</i>

43:18.462 --> 43:20.673
<i>He saved that old woman.</i>

43:20.840 --> 43:23.467
<i>He saved those two cops.</i>

43:24.051 --> 43:26.470
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

43:37.273 --> 43:38.482
I just wanna know...

43:39.692 --> 43:43.279
...if your wife weren't pregnant,
would you...?

43:47.658 --> 43:50.411
I'm sorry, that wasn't a fair question.

43:51.078 --> 43:52.330
Damn it, Jim.

43:55.666 --> 43:57.919
I'll request a transfer.

44:07.428 --> 44:10.181
Give me Flass, I'll see that you walk.

44:10.348 --> 44:13.851
Try this one, how about
I don't give you Flass and walk anyway?

44:14.352 --> 44:16.520
You got nothing on me.

44:16.687 --> 44:19.398
Save your little Q and A session
for the inquest, Gordon.

44:19.565 --> 44:21.901
My client just posted bail.

44:27.281 --> 44:30.534
If you say one word about Flass
and your life won't be worth a nickel.

44:31.035 --> 44:32.286
Are you listening to me?

44:32.453 --> 44:33.537
Yeah, sure.

44:33.704 --> 44:36.374
I want you in a blue suit with a tie.

44:36.540 --> 44:37.833
None of that pimp stuff.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.879
And when you smile at the jury,
make it nice. Particularly the women.

44:42.755 --> 44:44.715
You mean like this?

44:44.882 --> 44:48.219
Just remember,
they'll have their clothes on.

44:56.435 --> 44:58.062
You can never escape me.

45:00.064 --> 45:01.566
Nothing harms me.

45:02.191 --> 45:04.026
But I know pain.

45:04.402 --> 45:06.737
I know pain.

45:07.321 --> 45:12.868
Sometime I share it
with someone like you.

45:25.548 --> 45:27.049
You got Flass.

45:28.259 --> 45:30.428
Get the DA
and forget to tell the commissioner.

45:30.595 --> 45:31.846
On it.

45:32.763 --> 45:36.183
Sources inside the police department
reveal that Detective Arnold Flass...

45:36.350 --> 45:40.104
...has been implicated in Jefferson
Skeevers' massive drug operation.

45:40.271 --> 45:41.355
I just need to ask you...

45:41.522 --> 45:43.441
If I can just stop you
for just one moment.

45:43.608 --> 45:46.402
Detective. Detective,
Vicki Vale here with the local ne...

45:46.569 --> 45:48.279
Detective?

45:52.742 --> 45:56.913
You might have informed me
before handling Flass' head to IA.

45:57.079 --> 45:58.623
It was a slip-up, sir.

45:58.789 --> 46:02.418
Everyone's working such long hours.
Right, Brendon?

46:02.585 --> 46:05.087
You get good press, I'll give you that.

46:05.254 --> 46:07.798
<i>A.G. And his pack at the Gazette,
they like you.</i>

46:08.382 --> 46:09.842
But they don't know you.

46:10.009 --> 46:11.761
Not like we do.

46:19.143 --> 46:23.397
Be a shame if your wife were to learn
about your special working relationship...

46:23.564 --> 46:26.108
...with Detective Essen.

46:26.943 --> 46:29.195
Walls have ears, Jimmy.

46:37.328 --> 46:40.289
Everything looks good, Barbara.
I'll see you in a week.

46:40.456 --> 46:43.000
That is unless your son
decides differently.

46:51.342 --> 46:53.052
Are you okay?

46:53.344 --> 46:55.471
Yeah. Batman.

46:55.638 --> 46:57.139
<i>Lieutenant Gordon?</i>

46:58.724 --> 46:59.767
Gordon here.

46:59.934 --> 47:02.186
<i>Bruce Wayne's representative
is on the other line.</i>

47:02.603 --> 47:04.981
<i>Mr. Wayne's available
for an interview right now.</i>

47:05.147 --> 47:08.943
<i>- What should I tell him, sir?
- Tell him I'm on my way.</i>

47:09.235 --> 47:11.862
- Sorry, honey.
- That's okay.

47:12.029 --> 47:13.990
I've always wanted
to meet Bruce Wayne.

47:14.156 --> 47:15.658
They say he's quite charming.

47:24.083 --> 47:27.670
Police Lieutenant Gordon
and Mrs. Gordon, sir.

47:34.427 --> 47:37.221
Mrs. Gordon, I'm charmed.

47:38.180 --> 47:41.559
Alfred, be a joy
and get some glasses for our guests.

47:42.894 --> 47:45.521
And another bottle.
This one's evaporated.

47:45.688 --> 47:47.732
Little early in the day for us, thanks.

47:50.401 --> 47:52.278
Please, sit.

47:52.445 --> 47:55.740
Mr. Wayne, I don't wanna waste
any more of your time than necessary.

47:55.948 --> 47:58.242
I've been following your exploits,
lieutenant.

47:58.409 --> 48:00.077
I must say I'm impressed.

48:00.244 --> 48:02.955
You're getting about
as much press as this Batman fellow.

48:03.497 --> 48:06.626
It is Batman you wanted to talk about,
isn't it?

48:07.043 --> 48:09.587
Something about me being him?

48:09.754 --> 48:11.839
Pardon me. Where are my manners?

48:12.006 --> 48:14.592
I neglected to introduce my friend.

48:14.759 --> 48:16.928
Unfortunately,
I'm not sure what her name is.

48:17.094 --> 48:19.472
She doesn't speak any language
that I know.

48:19.639 --> 48:21.682
- Except one.
- How convenient.

48:21.849 --> 48:22.892
Barbara.

48:23.059 --> 48:26.771
Mr. Wayne, I need to know
where you were on the following dates.

48:30.066 --> 48:32.485
- He's a pig.
- He's acting like one.

48:32.652 --> 48:34.946
Anyone who'd wear a cape
and hunt criminals...

48:35.112 --> 48:37.114
...might go far to keep his secrets.

48:37.281 --> 48:40.910
Or he really is a sleazy,
womanizing scumbag.

48:44.121 --> 48:45.790
Jim, what is it?

48:48.459 --> 48:51.796
Honey,
there's something I need to tell you.

48:56.634 --> 48:58.636
<i>He's been sitting there for 10 minutes.</i>

49:01.597 --> 49:04.141
<i>Ah. Now he's moving. Good.</i>

49:04.308 --> 49:06.018
Grape juice and small talk.

49:06.185 --> 49:09.021
That is not my idea of a party,
Mr. Wayne.

49:09.188 --> 49:10.648
What are you complaining about?

49:10.815 --> 49:12.608
Easiest 5 grand you ever made.

49:13.317 --> 49:16.153
Can I go now? You guys are weird.

49:16.988 --> 49:22.118
Skeevers told us where, when
and how much money you received, Flass.

49:22.285 --> 49:24.287
You're facing 10 years in prison,
my friend.

49:24.453 --> 49:26.956
That is if Skeevers
is alive enough to testify.

49:27.123 --> 49:28.833
Uh, my client didn't mean that.

49:35.673 --> 49:36.674
Hello?

49:36.841 --> 49:39.302
<i>You know
your husband's been fooling around?</i>

49:39.468 --> 49:41.178
Yes, I know about Detective Essen.

49:41.345 --> 49:43.931
Don't bother calling here again.

49:55.985 --> 49:58.404
Rat poison. He's lucky.

49:58.571 --> 50:00.364
We pumped his stomach in time.

50:08.581 --> 50:11.542
Skeevers is still going to testify.

50:15.796 --> 50:18.382
Just keeping you informed, sir.

50:21.552 --> 50:24.722
<i>In his continuing
investigation into police corruption...</i>

50:24.889 --> 50:26.682
<i>...District Attorney Harvey Dent...</i>

50:26.849 --> 50:30.853
<i>...has promised a press conference early
next week to discuss the Flass case.</i>

50:31.020 --> 50:32.730
Lieutenant Gordon?

50:33.439 --> 50:36.067
It's a boy. Your wife is fine.

50:36.734 --> 50:40.321
<i>The city has experienced the fourth
in a daring series of cat burglaries.</i>

50:40.488 --> 50:43.574
<i>This time, the victim was none other
than Police Commissioner Loeb.</i>

50:43.741 --> 50:46.285
<i>The commissioner had a collection
of pop memorabilia.</i>

50:46.452 --> 50:50.623
Ugh! I thought he'd have jewels
or paintings, not these stupid toys.

50:50.790 --> 50:52.291
How can I sell this crap?

50:52.458 --> 50:54.085
I don't know. They're kind of cool.

50:54.252 --> 50:56.921
<i>- Charge Batman with the crime
they admit to no evidence.</i>

50:57.088 --> 50:58.256
Batman?

50:58.422 --> 51:00.967
They're giving the credit to Batman?

51:01.133 --> 51:04.929
But, Selina, you don't want them
to know it's you, do you?

51:05.596 --> 51:08.266
I hear Falcone's got a fortune
in old stuff.

51:08.766 --> 51:12.061
Maybe I'll give the Roman a little scratch
before I steal it.

51:12.770 --> 51:14.105
On the face.

51:14.272 --> 51:17.567
They won't think it's Batman
if I give him a scratch.

51:34.292 --> 51:37.128
<i>Hello, Johnny, my sister's boy.</i>

51:37.295 --> 51:40.840
You're a man now, Johnny.
A strong man.

51:41.007 --> 51:43.676
Mother says there are several men
plaguing you, sir.

51:43.843 --> 51:45.928
I need only be told their names.

51:46.095 --> 51:48.014
Your mother is wise in her way.

51:48.180 --> 51:49.348
You see, Johnny...

51:49.515 --> 51:53.477
...there are too many people in this world
who ask questions.

51:53.895 --> 51:57.356
And far, far too many who give answers.

51:57.523 --> 51:58.858
Mother said...

51:59.025 --> 52:00.318
Listen to me.

52:00.484 --> 52:05.656
- We must avoid more bad publicity, Johnny.
- Yes, sir.

52:05.823 --> 52:08.826
<i>- Here's what I need done.
Over there.</i>

52:22.882 --> 52:24.842
You work for Batman.

52:25.009 --> 52:26.969
I'll take care of this one.

52:27.511 --> 52:30.348
Here, kitty, kitty. Ugh!

52:36.395 --> 52:38.356
Thanks for wasting my time.

52:52.536 --> 52:54.372
You made the paper again, sir.

52:54.538 --> 52:59.001
<i>We must avoid more bad publicity, Johnny.</i>

52:59.168 --> 53:00.503
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

53:00.670 --> 53:03.422
<i>Here's what I need done.
Over there.</i>

53:04.048 --> 53:06.425
If only that cat woman
hadn't been there.

53:06.592 --> 53:09.845
Marked increase in paranoia. Hmm.

53:10.012 --> 53:12.431
The Roman says
he doesn't want bad publicity.

53:12.598 --> 53:14.684
It follows he won't murder anyone.

53:15.393 --> 53:17.186
What then? Blackmail?

53:17.353 --> 53:18.396
Extortion?

53:18.563 --> 53:22.775
Tendency toward aberrant,
even violent behavior.

53:23.484 --> 53:25.319
Kidnapping.

53:25.987 --> 53:27.738
Shall I fetch your tights, sir?

53:27.905 --> 53:30.449
Never during the day, Alfred.

53:30.700 --> 53:34.245
<i>Last night's attack connects
Batman to the recent string of burglaries.</i>

53:34.412 --> 53:37.123
<i>A woman in a cat costume,
presumably Batman's assistant...</i>

53:37.290 --> 53:39.250
<i>- Assistant?
... left before police arrived.</i>

53:39.417 --> 53:41.419
<i>- Now I'm his assistant?
In other news...</i>

53:44.297 --> 53:46.507
You're going to need your rest.

53:56.726 --> 53:58.561
All bets are off.

53:58.728 --> 53:59.896
You understand?

54:00.313 --> 54:01.606
Tell me what to do.

54:02.106 --> 54:03.608
Gordon, Johnny.

54:04.025 --> 54:06.903
Not gonna be easy.
He'll be hard to get to.

54:07.445 --> 54:09.947
Then make him come to you.

54:11.532 --> 54:17.705
Once a man becomes a father,
he is never truly free.

54:28.299 --> 54:30.426
Feeding time.

54:32.136 --> 54:33.804
My turn.

54:37.225 --> 54:39.352
Easy now. Almost warm.

54:43.981 --> 54:45.483
<i>- Gordon here.
Get down here.</i>

54:45.650 --> 54:47.902
Sir, Merkel's on duty, can't you...?

54:48.069 --> 54:50.571
Yes, sir. On my way.

54:53.241 --> 54:54.992
Gordon is leaving his apartment.

54:55.660 --> 54:56.953
Tell Falcone.

55:19.475 --> 55:20.560
Whoa!

55:22.228 --> 55:24.021
Maniac.

55:56.512 --> 55:57.972
Drop the gun, lieutenant.

55:58.139 --> 56:01.183
Go to your office, wait for our call.

56:01.350 --> 56:03.352
- Jim.
- You heard him, lieutenant.

56:03.519 --> 56:05.104
Drop the gun.

56:05.271 --> 56:09.525
<i>If I let them go,
my wife and son are dead.</i>

56:11.277 --> 56:13.654
The son of a bitch is crazy.

56:26.250 --> 56:29.420
Barbara, get out of here. Call Merkel.

56:38.596 --> 56:41.432
Don't move. I'll shoot, I will.

56:41.933 --> 56:44.769
Mrs. Gordon, I won't let your son die.

56:45.603 --> 56:47.271
Trust me.

58:57.485 --> 58:59.403
No!

59:20.716 --> 59:23.219
You must be wearing armor
under that jacket.

59:24.095 --> 59:25.596
Something like that.

59:26.013 --> 59:29.100
You know, I'm practically blind
without my glasses.

59:35.606 --> 59:37.483
You better go.

59:37.775 --> 59:39.527
And, thank you.

59:46.325 --> 59:49.120
<i>It turns out Flass
is smarter than he looks.</i>

59:49.287 --> 59:51.831
<i>Took notes on every little talk
he ever had with Loeb</i>

59:51.998 --> 59:55.334
<i>Dates, times, it was all there.</i>

59:58.588 --> 01:00:00.214
<i>Loeb is holding up pretty well...</i>

01:00:00.381 --> 01:00:03.009
<i>...for someone under federal indictment
for racketeering.</i>

01:00:06.679 --> 01:00:09.932
<i>He even offered up a sacrificial lamb.</i>

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.651
<i>Barbara's not crazy about the marriage
counselor, but we're making progress.</i>

01:00:21.527 --> 01:00:23.654
<i>As for me, well, there's a real panic on.</i>

01:00:24.196 --> 01:00:26.741
<i>Somebody has threatened to poison
the Gotham reservoir.</i>

01:00:26.908 --> 01:00:28.868
<i>He calls himself the Joker.</i>

01:00:29.869 --> 01:00:32.997
<i>I've got a friend coming
who might be able to help.</i>

01:00:33.164 --> 01:00:35.416
<i>He should be here any minute.</i>
