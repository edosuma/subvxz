14:10.792 --> 14:12.333
BE THE PEAK IF YOU

14:10.792 --> 14:12.333
DON'T WANT IT TO BE.

14:12.375 --> 14:13.166
-OH, MY GOD.

14:13.208 --> 14:15.125
SAMMY, TODAY WAS A FLUKE.

14:15.166 --> 14:16.875
I PLAYED OVER MY HEAD TODAY.

14:16.917 --> 14:19.333
I'LL NEVER HAVE A GAME

14:16.917 --> 14:19.333
THAT GOOD AGAIN, AND

14:19.375 --> 14:20.709
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

14:20.750 --> 14:25.667
NOW, CAN WE JUST ENJOY THIS

14:20.750 --> 14:25.667
NIGHT WHILE IT LASTS?

14:25.709 --> 14:26.667
-NO.

14:26.709 --> 14:27.667
I'M OUT.

14:27.709 --> 14:30.083
ENJOY YOUR PEAK.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.375
-SAMMY.

14:31.417 --> 14:33.625
SAMMY.

14:33.667 --> 14:34.583
-FREEZE.

14:34.625 --> 14:35.875
-WHOA.

14:34.625 --> 14:35.875
AHH.

14:38.959 --> 14:41.041
-SAMMY.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.667
COME ON, SAMMY.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.083
SAMMY.

15:02.834 --> 15:06.250
THIS IS GREAT.

15:06.291 --> 15:07.542
HEY.

15:13.709 --> 15:15.166
WHAT'S GOING ON, COACH?

15:15.208 --> 15:17.875
-WE'RE HAVING A COACH'S PARTY

15:15.208 --> 15:17.875
TO CELEBRATE OUR WIN.

15:17.917 --> 15:22.250

15:17.917 --> 15:22.250

15:22.291 --> 15:24.208

15:25.834 --> 15:29.250
YOU KNOW, FRIENDS WANT WHAT'S

15:25.834 --> 15:29.250
BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

15:29.291 --> 15:32.625
FRIENDS KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

15:29.291 --> 15:32.625
BETWEEN WHAT IS BUSINESS AND

15:32.667 --> 15:33.458
WHAT IS PERSONAL.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.333
AND--

15:34.375 --> 15:36.083
(BREAKING GLASS) -JESUS.

15:36.125 --> 15:38.458
-TURN OFF THAT MUSIC.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.875
HEY, I'M YOUR KIDS' GODFATHER.

15:41.917 --> 15:43.917
YOU WERE THE BEST MAN

15:41.917 --> 15:43.917

15:43.959 --> 15:46.583
DON'T SIT THERE AND TELL

15:43.959 --> 15:46.583
ME THIS ISN'T PERSONAL.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.458
THIS IS FOOTBALL.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.959
EVERYTHING WE DO IS PERSONAL.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.959
-YOU GUYS SEEM LIKE YOU'RE IN

15:51.000 --> 15:52.959
THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING SO I'M

15:53.000 --> 15:54.250

17:56.458 --> 17:59.709
-I DON'T DRINK WITH

17:56.458 --> 17:59.709
GYM TEACHERS.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.709
-LOOK, SAMMY, I'M SORRY.

18:01.750 --> 18:03.750

18:03.792 --> 18:06.959
CAPABLE OF GREAT THINGS.

18:09.625 --> 18:10.875
I DON'T KNOW.

18:13.333 --> 18:16.625
MAYBE YOU AND COACH ARE RIGHT.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.583
MAYBE THIS ISN'T MY PEAK.

18:18.625 --> 18:22.875
MAYBE THIS IS THE BEGINNING

18:18.625 --> 18:22.875
OF SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER.

18:22.917 --> 18:25.625
-I WAS BLUFFING ANYWAY.
