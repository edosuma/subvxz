WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:04.303
There he is.

00:04.305 --> 00:07.506
Mr. New York.
Mr. Broadway.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.673
Happy last day.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.107
I made you this.
Aw.

00:11.142 --> 00:12.942
It's a bunch of pictures of you.

00:12.944 --> 00:14.476
Well, I had to take
the necessary precautions,

00:14.478 --> 00:17.145
because the last time you left,
you forgot who I was.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.613
You called me Jebecca.

00:18.615 --> 00:20.615
Well, thank you so much, Jess.
I really like it.

00:20.617 --> 00:21.882
Cool.
Yeah.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.951
Well, that's a kick
in the shins.

00:24.953 --> 00:27.386
Look, nothing personal, but,
you know, I've moved a lot,

00:27.388 --> 00:29.621
so I have this
system that I use.

00:29.623 --> 00:32.790
Duffel bag full of
essentials only.

00:32.792 --> 00:35.459
And... one Jess cube.

00:35.461 --> 00:37.561
You can't get rid of me.

00:37.563 --> 00:39.462
Look, Jess, when I move,
I make a clean break, okay?

00:39.464 --> 00:41.197
I'm not going to get
all sentimental.

00:41.199 --> 00:43.132
And you promised you
wouldn't make a big deal.

00:43.134 --> 00:44.533
No, you're right, you're right.
I promised you I wouldn't.

00:44.535 --> 00:45.967
You did.
But...

00:45.969 --> 00:47.535
what about everyone else?

00:47.537 --> 00:49.436
Showtime!

00:50.404 --> 00:52.204
Hit it, Schmidt!

00:53.472 --> 00:55.239
Huh?

00:55.241 --> 00:57.207
Oh.
("New York, New York" plays)

00:57.209 --> 00:58.841
Nick, where's your
Donald Trump wig?

00:58.843 --> 00:59.875
It's here.
JESS: Ugh.

00:59.877 --> 01:01.076
This was not my vision.

01:01.078 --> 01:03.211
I specifically
said "dazzle."

01:03.213 --> 01:04.312
You said "razzle-dazzle,"
and we said,

01:04.314 --> 01:05.813
"We don't want to do that."

01:05.815 --> 01:07.481
Yeah, we told you
this is not what he would want.

01:07.483 --> 01:09.149
This isn't how men
say good-bye.

01:09.151 --> 01:12.318
(imitating Don Pardo): Live from
New York, it's Coach's good-bye!

01:12.320 --> 01:13.552
♪ Start spreading the news... ♪

01:13.554 --> 01:14.853
Yeah, show's over.

01:14.855 --> 01:16.487
We ain't doing this?

01:16.489 --> 01:20.190
♪ I'm leaving today ♪

01:20.192 --> 01:22.091
♪ I want to... ♪

01:28.331 --> 01:29.764
COACH:<i> The system works.</i>

01:29.766 --> 01:32.233
Remember,
essentials only.

01:32.235 --> 01:34.501
It's not just for packing;
it's a way of life.

01:34.503 --> 01:37.270
You want to move forward, you
got to get rid of the past.

01:37.272 --> 01:38.838
That means throw
out all your junk--

01:38.840 --> 01:40.840
Right... emotional
junk, actual junk.

01:40.842 --> 01:41.907
Got to make a clean break.

01:41.909 --> 01:43.675
Clean break. That's right.

01:43.677 --> 01:45.510
You're blowing my mind
right now, Coach.

01:45.512 --> 01:47.545
Doesn't even mean anything.
Or does it mean everything?

01:47.547 --> 01:48.879
JESS: I cannot
believe you're

01:48.881 --> 01:50.847
all buying into
Coach's crazy system.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.515
You guys have fun with
your clean break.

01:52.517 --> 01:54.383
I'm gonna go to my room,
and I guess

01:54.385 --> 01:55.851
I'll have to cancel
the horse and carriage

01:55.853 --> 01:57.352
that I hired to take you
to the airport.

01:57.354 --> 01:58.553
May and I are driving.

01:58.555 --> 01:59.854
JESS:
You are now.

01:59.856 --> 02:01.288
You guys sure
you're up for this?

02:01.290 --> 02:03.356
I am ready for this.
I'm single again.

02:03.358 --> 02:05.358
I'm a new man.
I'm leaving the past behind.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.625
NICK: I want to get rid
of my stuff,

02:06.627 --> 02:09.294
but all my stuff
is really, really good,

02:09.296 --> 02:11.062
and I just can't get rid of it.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.763
It's not, and you have to.

02:12.765 --> 02:13.864
Everything you own is trash.

02:13.866 --> 02:14.865
You're basically a hoarder.

02:14.867 --> 02:15.866
Not true.

02:15.868 --> 02:17.367
Everything has meaning.

02:17.369 --> 02:18.568
Everything is connected
to something else.

02:18.570 --> 02:20.369
You need to be hard
on yourself, okay?

02:20.371 --> 02:22.704
Now, take this box and fill it up.
Okay...

02:22.706 --> 02:24.772
Think I can do it?
Absolutely.

02:24.774 --> 02:27.541
Okay. I'm gonna get hard
and fix myself.

02:27.543 --> 02:29.576
What?
That's not... No.

02:29.578 --> 02:31.544
That's... I didn't... No.

02:31.546 --> 02:32.711
Oh, here we go.

02:32.713 --> 02:34.446
The Regis Philbin crepe pan.

02:34.448 --> 02:37.081
Come on, Coach.
You can't give this away.

02:37.083 --> 02:39.083
Remember February 2014?

02:39.085 --> 02:40.884
Or, as we like to call it,

02:40.886 --> 02:43.086
Crepe History Month.
Crepe History Month.

02:43.088 --> 02:44.587
WINSTON:
<i> It was a hot winter's night.</i>

02:44.589 --> 02:46.622
<i>We were drunk, but our judgment</i>
<i> was on point.</i>

02:46.624 --> 02:48.123
REGIS PHILBIN (over TV):
You hear that sizzle?

02:48.125 --> 02:50.425
Let that sizzle speak!

02:50.427 --> 02:52.093
Those pancakes are paper-thin.

02:52.095 --> 02:54.095
There's only three left,
so act fast.

02:54.097 --> 02:56.430
This crepe pan... is a knockout!

02:56.432 --> 02:58.665
Coach, we got to act fast.
We got to act fast.

02:58.667 --> 03:00.500
We got to act fast!
They're so thin!

03:00.502 --> 03:03.402
(both yelling)

03:03.404 --> 03:05.771
You got to take the Rege,
at least for the memories.

03:05.773 --> 03:07.739
The Rege, man.
The Rege!

03:07.741 --> 03:09.774
You know, I can't get rid of the Rege.
Psych! Can't get rid of the...

03:09.776 --> 03:11.242
I'm getting rid
of the Rege.

03:11.244 --> 03:12.476
Memories are nonessential,
all right?

03:12.478 --> 03:14.578
That's what makes
the system work.

03:14.580 --> 03:16.413
I found an ant farm
full of candy wrappers.

03:16.415 --> 03:17.614
Is this essential?

03:17.616 --> 03:18.915
Like, really, what do you think?

03:18.917 --> 03:20.750
Hmm? I need you to
get harder, Nick.

03:20.752 --> 03:22.852
Can you get harder for me?

03:22.854 --> 03:24.787
What? Do you need me
to get hard with you?

03:24.789 --> 03:26.021
I feel like you're not...

03:26.023 --> 03:27.589
meaning to say
what you're saying.

03:27.591 --> 03:28.856
Talking about cleaning up.

03:28.858 --> 03:30.657
Schmidt, I think you forgot
about this box.

03:31.759 --> 03:33.426
Oh, oh, that's cool.
Thanks, man.

03:33.428 --> 03:35.528
I appreciate it.
Oh... you got a Cece box.

03:35.530 --> 03:36.929
So what? It's not
like everybody

03:36.931 --> 03:38.964
hasn't seen your
Phylicia Rashad box.

03:38.966 --> 03:41.366
No, you hav... You have?
Birthday card...

03:41.368 --> 03:44.268
Don't... please don't go
in the Cece box. Don't do...

03:44.270 --> 03:46.470
...a crude drawing of...

03:46.472 --> 03:48.972
you and Cece and your
mixed-race child.

03:48.974 --> 03:50.440
Yes, I painted that.

03:50.442 --> 03:51.774
Ooh, five dollars!
Come to daddy.

03:51.776 --> 03:54.343
This five dollars
belongs in the box.

03:54.345 --> 03:56.044
It's from the night
that I first met Cece.

03:56.046 --> 03:57.979
Looks like it's finally
just the two of us, huh?

03:57.981 --> 04:00.448
Oh, God, you're about to say
something stupid, aren't you?

04:00.450 --> 04:02.216
Yeah.

04:02.218 --> 04:04.218
Girl...

04:04.220 --> 04:05.552
And then I said
something stupid, and Cece

04:05.554 --> 04:06.786
made me put money
in the douche bag jar.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.354
What'd you say?
You say you can flex

04:08.356 --> 04:09.955
your butt cheeks like pecs?
I bet you were all like,

04:09.957 --> 04:12.490
"You're making my dong
go crazy!"

04:12.492 --> 04:13.557
WINSTON: I bet he said
something chauvinistic...

04:13.559 --> 04:15.992
(laughs)
...that comes from insecurity

04:15.994 --> 04:18.227
but ultimately leads
to something endearing.

04:18.229 --> 04:19.461
You know, it doesn't
matter what I said.

04:19.463 --> 04:21.463
Nonessential, right?
Exactly.

04:21.465 --> 04:22.730
So, good-bye, Cece.

04:22.732 --> 04:23.831
May some poor
street urchin

04:23.833 --> 04:25.299
with a perfect 34-D

04:25.301 --> 04:26.933
enjoy the sports bra
that you left in my car.

04:28.468 --> 04:29.634
WINSTON:
<i> We got to tell Schmidt</i>

04:29.636 --> 04:30.835
that Cece is in love with him.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.703
Right now,
he is out there

04:32.705 --> 04:34.371
throwing away all
of his Cece mementos,

04:34.373 --> 04:36.406
acting like he's just
going to move on.

04:36.408 --> 04:39.675
Jess, I cannot watch this
when I know what I know.

04:39.677 --> 04:41.476
I know.
We got to tell him.

04:41.478 --> 04:43.244
I promised her I
wouldn't get involved.

04:43.246 --> 04:45.312
I always meddle.
I've learned my lesson.

04:45.314 --> 04:47.647
She's trying to get
Schmidt out of her system,

04:47.649 --> 04:48.981
and we have to support her,

04:48.983 --> 04:51.016
even if it means letting
her climb a mountain

04:51.018 --> 04:52.751
with no prior knowledge
or experience.

04:52.753 --> 04:54.986
Yeah, but does she know
that Schmidt and Fawn broke up?

04:54.988 --> 04:56.654
Is she getting our voice mails?

04:56.656 --> 04:58.522
I don't know.
She hasn't called me back.

04:58.524 --> 05:00.891
Maybe there's no reception
on the top of Mount Shasta.

05:00.893 --> 05:02.659
(snaps fingers)
We try again.

05:02.661 --> 05:04.827
Hey, Cece, it's Je...
Hey, yo, Ceec, what up, fam?

05:04.829 --> 05:07.262
It's your girl Winston,
aka Winnie the Bish,

05:07.264 --> 05:09.564
aka-ak-aka Brown Lightning.

05:09.566 --> 05:11.999
Schmidt dropped Fawn
like a bad habit, okay,

05:12.001 --> 05:13.700
so ain't nobody riding shotgun.

05:13.702 --> 05:15.768
So you better get on
while the getting is good.

05:15.770 --> 05:17.636
You got it?

05:19.538 --> 05:21.772
I hate that you're
so good at this.

05:21.774 --> 05:23.406
I was so nervous.

05:23.408 --> 05:25.007
Look at all this crap.

05:25.009 --> 05:26.341
Look at this.

05:26.343 --> 05:27.742
"Associated Strategies."

05:27.744 --> 05:29.777
"Ass Strat." What a joke.

05:29.779 --> 05:33.247
More like "Butt Strat."
This place is total butt.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.948
Hey, Jess, it's our sex mug.

05:34.950 --> 05:36.215
What?
What?

05:36.217 --> 05:37.683
Oh... nothing.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.218
It's just a mug
that Nick and I used for sex.

05:40.220 --> 05:42.386
Oh, gross. Like, in it?
Ew! What?

05:42.388 --> 05:44.621
No. No, we used it
when we were dating.

05:44.623 --> 05:45.955
It was hard
to find times

05:45.957 --> 05:47.556
to be intimate
with everyone around,

05:47.558 --> 05:49.591
so we needed to come up
with a code.

05:49.593 --> 05:51.859
Just a way to let each other
know we were aroused

05:51.861 --> 05:53.594
without arousing suspicion.

05:53.596 --> 05:55.562
That's wordplay.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.397
It's also a free writing lesson.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.865
JESS:
When one of us

05:58.867 --> 06:00.900
left the mug
on the entryway table...

06:00.902 --> 06:02.368
"Ass" out meant
it was time to...

06:02.370 --> 06:04.269
Make love.
...bone.

06:04.271 --> 06:05.637
Yeah, make love.

06:05.639 --> 06:07.205
We're getting rid of
this thing-- especially since

06:07.207 --> 06:08.639
you guys aren't
using it anymore, right?

06:08.641 --> 06:10.374
NICK and JESS: Right.
Wrong.

06:10.376 --> 06:13.076
I, Winston L'Andre Bishop,

06:13.078 --> 06:18.214
saw that very mug
on this very hallway table

06:18.216 --> 06:20.282
just last week...

06:20.284 --> 06:22.651
"Ass" very out.

06:22.653 --> 06:24.719
Ooh...!

06:24.721 --> 06:26.387
JESS:
Winston, that mug hasn't seen

06:26.389 --> 06:27.755
any action in
over a year.

06:27.757 --> 06:28.956
You're off
your rocker.

06:28.958 --> 06:30.657
If I were off my rocker,

06:30.659 --> 06:33.226
would I take a weekly selfie
with my cat?

06:33.228 --> 06:34.727
Oh, Winston.

06:34.729 --> 06:38.397
You see, just last week,
I took this selfie with...

06:38.399 --> 06:39.731
(chuckling):
Wait, not that one.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.600
(Winston laughing)

06:42.602 --> 06:45.169
That's crazy. Not that one.
I forgot I had this one.

06:46.404 --> 06:48.004
This selfie,

06:48.006 --> 06:50.339
in front of that table.

06:50.341 --> 06:53.408
Sex mug. Question is,
who put the mug out?

06:53.410 --> 06:55.291
All right, let's not play
the "who put the mug

06:55.316 --> 06:57.011
out" game. We should
be focusing on Coach.

06:57.013 --> 06:59.413
I saw you checking out
Jess's butt last week.

06:59.415 --> 07:01.415
No. Yes, she was wearing
the "look at me" skirt.

07:01.417 --> 07:02.916
All right, well, let's not try to...
My money's on Jess.

07:02.918 --> 07:04.784
Wait. She hasn't had
sex since Ryan,

07:04.786 --> 07:06.752
and desperate times
call for Nick Miller.

07:06.754 --> 07:08.854
Is the "look at me"
skirt the green one?

07:08.856 --> 07:10.455
Hey. Do not change the subject.
You are implicating yourself

07:10.457 --> 07:11.889
by changing
the subject like that.

07:11.891 --> 07:13.223
Hey!

07:13.225 --> 07:14.457
I put the mug out.

07:14.459 --> 07:16.859
Okay? And, actually,
nothing happened,

07:16.861 --> 07:18.694
and I regret nothing.

07:18.696 --> 07:20.295
Now, I'm going
to my room,

07:20.297 --> 07:23.631
and I'm considering
throwing out my sunglasses.

07:32.073 --> 07:34.641
So long, old friend.

07:34.643 --> 07:35.642
(sighs)

07:35.644 --> 07:38.044
Just doesn't feel right.

07:38.046 --> 07:40.379
(chuckles):
Welcome back, old friend.

07:40.381 --> 07:42.047
(knocks)
Hey.

07:43.082 --> 07:44.315
Got a second?

07:44.317 --> 07:45.883
Jess, we don't
have to talk about it.

07:45.885 --> 07:48.886
Obviously, I was the one
who put the mug out,

07:48.888 --> 07:51.622
so I wanted to thank you
for covering for me.

07:51.624 --> 07:53.090
No problem.
Obviously, we're broken up,

07:53.092 --> 07:55.792
and it was...
a moment of weakness.

07:55.794 --> 07:57.493
I didn't even know
you put it out; I didn't see it.

07:57.495 --> 07:59.061
Oh!
No harm, no foul.

07:59.063 --> 07:59.895
Well...
We didn't bone.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.563
No bone, no phone home.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.432
Great. So we're cool.
I'm cool if you're cool.

08:04.434 --> 08:05.499
Fanterstic.

08:05.501 --> 08:07.734
I'm going to knit
a scarf for Coach.

08:07.736 --> 08:09.168
I'm sure he'll love it.
Okay, bye.

08:09.170 --> 08:11.970
Thanks for the chat.
Sayonara.

08:12.905 --> 08:14.071
Hey, Nick, uh, do you want

08:14.073 --> 08:15.605
to know why I put the mug out?

08:15.607 --> 08:17.239
We're cool!
We're cool.

08:17.241 --> 08:18.273
Go knit that scarf.
Right.

08:18.275 --> 08:20.341
(door closes)

08:35.590 --> 08:36.990
(whispers):
Okay.

08:38.926 --> 08:41.127
No, no, no! Cece!

08:41.129 --> 08:43.262
I want it back!
I want it back!

08:44.464 --> 08:45.964
Pop, pop, little bubble!

08:45.966 --> 08:48.099
Let that sizzle speak.

08:48.101 --> 08:50.167
It's time to flip.
Care to do the honors?

08:50.169 --> 08:51.434
Ah, sure, man. That'd be cool.

08:53.270 --> 08:55.170
Rude.

08:55.172 --> 08:57.639
Winston, you're not gonna trick
me into taking the stupid pan.

08:57.641 --> 08:59.273
It stays behind--
that's the system!

08:59.275 --> 09:00.974
Clean break.

09:00.976 --> 09:02.608
You know what, fine, Coach,
don't take it with you.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.809
Leave everything behind.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.277
Try not to remember anyone.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.646
We are nonessential.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.514
Message received.

09:11.817 --> 09:14.151
Nah, Coach,
I don't think so.

09:14.153 --> 09:16.786
Because this
crepe belongs

09:16.788 --> 09:19.355
in the belly of
someone with a heart.

09:24.961 --> 09:27.062
(sighs)

09:28.030 --> 09:29.196
Damn it!

09:30.131 --> 09:31.297
Ouch!

09:32.299 --> 09:33.399
(groans)

09:37.303 --> 09:38.970
Why are you so secure?

09:38.972 --> 09:40.705
You're filled with things
that nobody wants!

09:43.675 --> 09:45.809
Oh. Thank God.

09:45.811 --> 09:47.243
Hey, how are you?

09:47.245 --> 09:48.978
I dropped something in the
bin, and I need it back.

09:48.980 --> 09:50.412
You Jewish?

09:57.719 --> 10:00.487
I just need a bo...
I just need a box.

10:00.489 --> 10:02.322
I just can't part with you.

10:02.324 --> 10:04.824
Okay, I'll tell you what happened.
You knit fast.

10:04.826 --> 10:07.993
Winston had fallen asleep
polishing his candelabra.

10:07.995 --> 10:09.995
<i> I had just opened</i>
<i> a bottle of pink wine,</i>

10:09.997 --> 10:11.863
<i> and then you showed up. </i>
NICK: Oh, hey.

10:11.865 --> 10:13.264
Just working out.

10:13.266 --> 10:14.898
Got to sweep the temple.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.067
♪ ♪

10:20.904 --> 10:25.240
(groaning, growling)

10:26.709 --> 10:28.843
Damn...

10:30.679 --> 10:32.846
So, see, it wasn't my fault.

10:32.848 --> 10:34.848
In your defense,
I've been working on my body,

10:34.850 --> 10:36.916
doing my burpees, and it shows.

10:38.218 --> 10:40.452
(knees crackling)

10:46.191 --> 10:48.192
(knees crackle)

10:48.194 --> 10:50.060
(winded):
I'm not gonna do that again.

10:50.062 --> 10:51.928
Nick...
Warrior pose!

10:53.430 --> 10:56.432
Nick, is there anything
that I do

10:56.434 --> 11:01.136
that makes you think about
putting the mug out?

11:03.772 --> 11:05.838
No, I-I can't think of anything.

11:07.774 --> 11:09.441
Right.

11:09.443 --> 11:11.543
It's just not the way
that this old brain works.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.211
Clean break.

11:13.213 --> 11:15.746
Great. Clean break. I agree.

11:15.748 --> 11:17.881
Jess, hold on. Hey, hey...
H-How is that...?

11:18.749 --> 11:20.816
Jess, wait!

11:22.285 --> 11:24.519
Yeah, I'm stuck.

11:27.923 --> 11:28.923
Well, we seem to be

11:28.925 --> 11:29.924
in a bit of a conundrum.

11:29.926 --> 11:31.492
How do I know this is your box?

11:31.494 --> 11:32.926
Do you have
any identification, "Cece"?

11:32.928 --> 11:34.827
Cece's my ex-girlfriend;
it's a box of her things.

11:34.829 --> 11:36.795
But I can tell you
everything that's in there.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.730
There's some paintings,
erotic writings,

11:38.732 --> 11:39.731
there's a brassiere.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.232
Why would you have
her brassiere?

11:41.234 --> 11:43.067
Well, you know, she left it
in my car, and I kept it.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.768
She never asked
for it back?

11:44.770 --> 11:48.238
Okay, um, Wally, look,
it's a box of memories.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.740
Memories that I'm not
ready to let go of yet.

11:50.742 --> 11:52.174
Maybe if I could
talk to Cece...

11:52.176 --> 11:54.109
Can't talk to Cece;
Cece's on top of a mountain.

11:54.111 --> 11:56.010
Look, I know
this is unusual,

11:56.012 --> 11:57.277
but I need that box back, Wally.

11:57.279 --> 11:58.911
I need it back
more than anything else

11:58.913 --> 12:00.779
I've ever needed in my life.

12:00.781 --> 12:02.147
Please.

12:02.149 --> 12:04.749
Does she know
she's on the mountain,

12:04.751 --> 12:06.617
or is she being held there
against her will?

12:06.619 --> 12:07.751
Damn it, Wally, give me the box!

12:07.753 --> 12:09.786
No! No!

12:09.788 --> 12:11.921
No! No!

12:11.923 --> 12:13.255
(whistle blowing)
Wally!

12:13.257 --> 12:14.856
Stop blowing
the whistle!

12:14.858 --> 12:16.424
You're sexually safe!

12:19.861 --> 12:21.294
Coach, is that
a bigger bag?

12:21.296 --> 12:24.130
My old bag broke,
so I got a wheelie.

12:24.132 --> 12:25.364
Same system.

12:25.366 --> 12:26.932
Still only essentials.

12:26.934 --> 12:28.199
(pan clangs)

12:28.201 --> 12:30.167
Is there a
pan in there?

12:30.169 --> 12:32.035
Nah. Nah, that's not a pan.

12:32.037 --> 12:33.770
That was just, uh, the sound of

12:33.772 --> 12:35.271
two track pants
hitting together.

12:35.273 --> 12:38.439
You know, the buttons
be like... ting... ti...

12:39.707 --> 12:41.941
But, um... (clears throat)

12:41.943 --> 12:43.776
Yeah, since I got
this new suitcase,

12:43.778 --> 12:45.944
I might as well take
a few more things.

12:45.946 --> 12:47.946
Just to fill up space.
Know what I mean?

12:47.948 --> 12:49.280
Just to fill up space.

12:49.282 --> 12:51.715
Like, uh...

12:51.717 --> 12:54.183
take these glass grapes.

12:56.119 --> 12:57.352
Just to fill up space.

12:57.354 --> 12:58.686
Not that I want them.

12:58.688 --> 12:59.687
Of course not.

12:59.689 --> 13:00.788
And this blanket.

13:00.790 --> 13:02.289
For cushioning.

13:02.291 --> 13:03.490
(moans)

13:03.492 --> 13:04.557
That smells nice, huh?

13:04.559 --> 13:06.091
For cushioning, dude.

13:07.193 --> 13:08.560
These mystery novels.

13:08.562 --> 13:10.328
Take these.

13:10.330 --> 13:12.563
Not 'cause they're Jess's,
just because...

13:12.565 --> 13:14.298
I'm an avid reader now.

13:14.300 --> 13:16.800
Stop smiling at me, man.

13:16.802 --> 13:18.968
I'm taking Nick's workout jams.

13:18.970 --> 13:20.836
'Cause, uh...

13:20.838 --> 13:22.804
that one time
I trained him,

13:22.806 --> 13:24.472
(voice breaking):
saw a lot of results.

13:24.474 --> 13:26.907
(voice breaking):
I remember. He was so fat.

13:26.909 --> 13:29.476
And I'm taking this remote.

13:29.478 --> 13:31.811
Because you always hit
the info button by mistake.

13:31.813 --> 13:34.213
No, no, it's not
by mistake, Coach.

13:34.215 --> 13:35.814
(sobbing softly)

13:35.816 --> 13:37.982
I like to know more
about the cast and crew.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.185
Remote's gonna miss this TV
so much.

13:41.187 --> 13:44.088
Our TV is gonna miss
that remote.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.690
(sobs)

13:46.692 --> 13:48.158
(sniffs)

13:48.160 --> 13:49.759
Smells like all our fingers.

13:49.761 --> 13:52.361
(both sobbing)

13:52.363 --> 13:54.429
(wailing)

13:57.132 --> 13:58.298
Hey, Jess.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.699
Hey.

13:59.701 --> 14:02.535
Do you really think

14:02.537 --> 14:04.703
I haven't thought about
putting this mug out?

14:04.705 --> 14:07.272
Oh, I don't know, Nick.
You said it.

14:07.274 --> 14:09.207
What's past is past.
Clean break.

14:09.209 --> 14:12.443
Think about my living
conditions for the past year.

14:12.445 --> 14:15.345
I live across the hall from
my beautiful ex-girlfriend.

14:15.347 --> 14:17.480
And your living
conditions--

14:17.482 --> 14:19.648
you live across the hall from
your beautiful ex-boyfriend.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.384
Two true beauties.

14:22.386 --> 14:23.618
So you have thought about it.

14:23.620 --> 14:24.685
I'm a man.

14:24.687 --> 14:26.620
I am a human man.
Interesting.

14:26.622 --> 14:28.955
You're the one who's always
getting out of that shower

14:28.957 --> 14:30.122
in that little
towel, Jess.

14:30.124 --> 14:31.523
Or you're wearing
your glitter

14:31.525 --> 14:33.291
or your pantyhose.

14:33.293 --> 14:35.459
They're driving
me crazy! Okay?

14:35.461 --> 14:37.461
I know how hard it is to
get those pantyhose up,

14:37.463 --> 14:39.463
and I just... I just sometimes
want to rip 'em down.

14:39.465 --> 14:41.198
Just admit it, Miller!

14:41.200 --> 14:42.999
You're thinking about putting
the mug down right now!

14:43.001 --> 14:44.533
No.

14:44.535 --> 14:47.569
Admit that you want me
to be thinking about it.

14:47.571 --> 14:50.238
I don't want you to think about it,
so stop thinking about it. Well...

14:50.240 --> 14:51.973
stop talking about it and then
I'll stop thinking about it.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.307
So, you are thinking about it?
Look, Jess!

14:53.309 --> 14:54.741
I'm not not...

14:56.477 --> 14:59.412
...thinking about it.

14:59.414 --> 15:00.780
(door opens)

15:02.315 --> 15:05.317
Hey, guys. Want to know
what happened to me today?

15:05.319 --> 15:07.352
JESS and NICK: We're kind of in the middle
of something.... Fine, I'll tell you.

15:07.354 --> 15:10.021
I spent $500 to get back
a five dollar bill.

15:10.023 --> 15:11.889
Go ahead, call me a fool.

15:11.891 --> 15:13.357
You won't be the first person
to call me that today.

15:13.359 --> 15:15.359
You're a fool!

15:15.361 --> 15:17.160
I need to move on.

15:17.162 --> 15:18.861
I'm never gonna
get Cece back.

15:18.863 --> 15:20.429
And I know it's my fault
that I lost her.

15:20.431 --> 15:21.663
NICK:
You lost her twice.

15:21.665 --> 15:23.665
You had her...
I know I lost her twice.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.667
Why would you have to...? Then
you got her, then you blew it.

15:25.669 --> 15:26.668
Then you got her...

15:26.670 --> 15:29.237
Who are you clarifying this for?

15:29.239 --> 15:31.105
Are you sure you know
how Cece feels about you?

15:31.107 --> 15:32.606
Yeah, I mean,
she said a thousand times

15:32.608 --> 15:34.507
that she only wants
to be friends with me.

15:34.509 --> 15:37.443
Schmidt... Jess, Cece doesn't
love me and she never will.

15:37.445 --> 15:39.211
So I think it's
time to let go.

15:39.213 --> 15:41.413
Nick, I want you to have
this five dollars. What?

15:41.415 --> 15:43.548
Go buy yourself something
special, like a burrito.

15:43.550 --> 15:45.383
I love burritos.

15:45.385 --> 15:46.917
Oh, I have to tell you
something, Schmidt!

15:46.919 --> 15:48.251
I... (groans)

15:48.253 --> 15:50.453
But I can't tell you.

15:50.455 --> 15:51.954
(groans)
So, I'll...

15:51.956 --> 15:53.755
I'll tell you.
Loophole!

15:53.757 --> 15:54.889
Nick...

15:54.891 --> 15:57.191
Cece's in love with Schmidt.

15:57.193 --> 15:59.259
What?

15:59.261 --> 16:01.227
(sighs)
Yeah.

16:01.229 --> 16:03.529
For real?

16:03.531 --> 16:05.697
Well...
Also, Winston promised...

16:05.699 --> 16:07.198
Why are we talking about Winston?!
Winston...

16:07.200 --> 16:08.933
Cece loves me!
Nick, we did it!

16:08.935 --> 16:10.134
I got to go!

16:13.538 --> 16:14.538
Can't wait for Cece

16:14.540 --> 16:15.705
to get back from her trip.

16:15.707 --> 16:18.107
I'm going after her.
Coach... (sighs)

16:20.477 --> 16:22.277
I used to wish
that you were uglier.

16:23.612 --> 16:25.245
I don't wish that anymore.

16:25.247 --> 16:27.046
I only wish you the best.

16:27.048 --> 16:29.481
Hey, you're the handsome one
in the loft now.

16:29.483 --> 16:32.383
Big responsibility,
but I think you're ready.

16:32.385 --> 16:34.551
All right, you guys, I'm off.

16:34.553 --> 16:36.419
Off to climb a mountain.

16:36.421 --> 16:37.887
I'll see you in autumn.

16:37.889 --> 16:39.889
Winter at the latest.

16:39.891 --> 16:41.223
Good luck, Schmidt.
Yeah.

16:41.225 --> 16:42.724
You go get her!
Okay.

16:42.726 --> 16:44.158
COACH:
Find that girl.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.827
WINSTON: See you, Schmidt!
JESS: Bye!

16:46.829 --> 16:49.629
Cece!

16:49.631 --> 16:52.498
Cece.

16:54.467 --> 16:56.234
Hey, um...

16:56.236 --> 16:58.903
so, I was, I was on the top
of this mountain,

16:58.905 --> 17:00.638
and I finally got cell reception

17:00.640 --> 17:02.940
and there were, like,
20 voice mails from...

17:02.942 --> 17:04.975
Are you in love with me?

17:06.143 --> 17:08.244
Because I'm in love with you.

17:08.246 --> 17:10.579
Deeply.

17:10.581 --> 17:12.581
But I assumed that you would
never because I've...

17:12.583 --> 17:14.182
I've messed this up
so many times.

17:14.184 --> 17:15.683
And you've made it very clear
that you just want to be friends

17:15.685 --> 17:17.785
with me and I value
that friendship so much.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.787
So if I'm ruining it by doing

17:19.789 --> 17:22.256
any of this,
please, please stop me!

17:22.258 --> 17:25.058
Schmidt.

17:28.494 --> 17:30.595
I'm in...

17:30.597 --> 17:32.296
I'm in love with you.

17:32.298 --> 17:34.464
(quietly cheering)

17:34.466 --> 17:35.665
Really?

17:35.667 --> 17:36.832
Mm-hmm.

17:36.834 --> 17:40.101
Yeah.

17:40.103 --> 17:43.871
Yeah, it's kind of stupid how
much I'm in love with you.

17:43.873 --> 17:46.173
You should've seen how fast
I came down that mountain.

17:46.175 --> 17:47.841
I mean, a lot of it was falling.

17:47.843 --> 17:49.742
Luckily, the ground
just stopped me, but...

17:51.778 --> 17:53.278
You remember this?

17:53.280 --> 17:56.381
Looks like it's finally
just the two of us, huh?

17:56.383 --> 17:58.649
Oh, God, you're about to say
something stupid, aren't you?

17:58.651 --> 18:00.283
Yeah.

18:00.285 --> 18:03.519
Girl, I'm-a marry you.

18:03.521 --> 18:04.653
Jar.

18:04.655 --> 18:07.155
I know this might seem crazy,

18:07.157 --> 18:09.790
uh, and...

18:09.792 --> 18:12.793
probably a little bit impulsive,
but it's not.

18:12.795 --> 18:15.529
Not for me.

18:15.531 --> 18:17.863
I've known since the minute
that I met you.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.567
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.868
Cecelia Parikh...

18:23.870 --> 18:25.169
Oh, God, you're gonna say

18:25.171 --> 18:26.270
something stupid, aren't you?

18:27.472 --> 18:28.972
Girl, will you marry me?

18:28.974 --> 18:32.475
(all gasping, screaming,
laughing)

18:32.477 --> 18:34.176
Would you please shut up?!
I can't hear the answer!

18:34.178 --> 18:35.143
Oh. Shh. Yeah.

18:36.011 --> 18:37.144
Yes!

18:37.146 --> 18:38.678
(all cheering)

18:38.680 --> 18:40.913
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

18:42.248 --> 18:43.982
We're getting married!

18:43.984 --> 18:46.383
(all cheering)

18:47.818 --> 18:50.286
(chattering happily)
We did it!

18:53.423 --> 18:55.123
Go say bye.

18:58.660 --> 19:01.394
Uh...

19:02.396 --> 19:06.097
I love you guys and, uh...

19:06.099 --> 19:08.566
I'm gonna miss you.

19:09.334 --> 19:10.901
Especially you, Jebecca.

19:12.069 --> 19:13.502
Aw.

19:13.504 --> 19:14.503
(all laugh)

19:14.505 --> 19:15.537
All right, man.

19:15.539 --> 19:17.672
All right!
Aw.

19:17.674 --> 19:18.773
We're gonna miss you.

19:18.775 --> 19:19.840
Bye, buddy.

19:19.842 --> 19:21.274
Good-bye, Coach.

19:21.276 --> 19:22.441
See you, man.

19:22.443 --> 19:24.075
See you, Coach! Save the date!
Bye!

19:24.077 --> 19:25.342
Bye!

19:25.344 --> 19:26.876
Bye!
Don't ever change, Coach.

19:26.878 --> 19:29.011
