00:01.100 --> 00:01.940
Here are a few things

00:02.080 --> 00:03.520
that you might need to know.

00:03.521 --> 00:03.880
- Jill!

00:03.960 --> 00:06.360
There's no scenario in which
you should be going to dinner

00:06.440 --> 00:08.240
with the girl that dumped you,
broke your heart

00:08.820 --> 00:10.007
and slept with
your best friend.

00:10.100 --> 00:11.300
What about your
cover girlfriend?

00:11.380 --> 00:12.380
Won't she be jealous?

00:12.460 --> 00:14.300
Our relationship's a cover.

00:14.380 --> 00:17.580
You know, there's nothing
to be jealous about.

00:17.620 --> 00:19.380
Chuck this is my boss,
Guy LeFleur.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.860
Hi. Nice to meet you.

00:21.940 --> 00:23.500
MI-6 has reports that
he may have developed

00:23.580 --> 00:26.380
a bioweapon which he plans
to sell to the highest bidder.

00:29.220 --> 00:30.180
The assassin
Agent Walker shot

00:30.260 --> 00:32.060
was a member of FULCRUM.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.100
If Jill knows something,

00:33.140 --> 00:34.460
they may make a play for her.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.260 --> 00:45.980
The sensor will be blind
for 20 seconds.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.780
Welcome to the world
of international espionage.

01:10.860 --> 01:12.740
Very handy for picnics.

01:12.780 --> 01:14.540
I have to say, I still can't
wrap my head around

01:14.580 --> 01:15.980
the idea of you as a spy.

01:16.020 --> 01:17.980
You never told me
how that happened.

01:18.060 --> 01:19.340
Uh... well...

01:19.380 --> 01:22.060
You don't choose your
profession, Jill.

01:22.140 --> 01:24.460
The right job chooses you.

01:24.540 --> 01:26.180
Still-- never
would've guessed it.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.300
Well, how about you soak
up this romantic view.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.260
Yeah, real romantic.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.780
What? This is
the Buy More roof.

01:32.860 --> 01:33.940
You smell that?

01:34.020 --> 01:35.660
You smell what you're
smelling right now?

01:35.700 --> 01:37.700
That is rarefied air, that very
few people ever get to experience.

01:37.740 --> 01:39.140
Not to mention
the fact

01:39.220 --> 01:41.700
that there aren't a lot
of places I can go

01:41.780 --> 01:43.380
that aren't under
constant surveillance.

01:43.460 --> 01:45.420
The government finds me very...

01:47.340 --> 01:49.340
...very valuable.

01:49.420 --> 01:51.300
Well, I can't say
that I blame them.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.820
You've got to be kidding me.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.380
Wait, hold on.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.500
Give me a break.

02:12.580 --> 02:14.300
Are you kidding me?

02:14.340 --> 02:15.661
I've got her here.
We're having some food.

02:15.662 --> 02:16.000
Amateur.

02:16.540 --> 02:17.780
Casey, is that necessary?

02:17.860 --> 02:19.940
How much trouble can
he get into on a date?

02:19.980 --> 02:21.020
It's Bartowski.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.100
You're pretty nonchalant about
your supercomputer boyfriend

02:25.180 --> 02:26.820
trying to browse someone
else's network.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.580
Well, I am just
his cover girlfriend.

02:28.660 --> 02:30.060
...with your bank of monitors.

02:30.140 --> 02:32.340
You get off on this,
don't you?

02:32.420 --> 02:33.820
Chuck's entitled to a real one.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.220
Major Casey, Agent Walker.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.060
I have the intel
on your new mission.

02:41.100 --> 02:43.540
But it's going to require some
unorthodox reconnaissance.

02:43.620 --> 02:46.300
Turns out our deceased doctor,
Guy LeFleur,

02:46.340 --> 02:47.660
obtained a list
of CIA code names

02:47.700 --> 02:49.140
for the agents he worked with.

02:49.220 --> 02:50.620
We have reason to believe
it's a list

02:50.700 --> 02:52.740
of FULCRUM operatives.
This may be our only chance

02:52.780 --> 02:55.060
to find the corrupt agents
within our ranks.

02:55.140 --> 02:56.980
Great.
And where's the list now?

02:57.060 --> 02:58.180
Intel thinks it's hidden

02:58.260 --> 02:59.900
in Guy's hotel room
at the Waldron.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.660
We have to get that list
before FULCRUM does.

03:01.740 --> 03:02.980
You need to
take the Intersect in

03:03.020 --> 03:05.220
off-the-record
and see if he can flash.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.700
Perhaps Chuck can find out
where the list is hidden.

03:07.780 --> 03:09.260
You want us to break into

03:09.300 --> 03:10.620
a government-controlled
crime scene?

03:10.660 --> 03:12.700
It's the FBI.
How hard can it be?

03:14.300 --> 03:16.420
Bogie at 5:00.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.860
I'll handle this.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.900
Really? A camera on the roof
because of what?

03:26.940 --> 03:29.180
All the terrorist activity
on top of the Buy More?

03:29.220 --> 03:31.140
Okay, Casey may have been
a little aggressive,

03:31.180 --> 03:33.780
but we just received our new mission.
- Already?

03:33.820 --> 03:36.260
Tomorrow we're going to break
into Guy LeFleur's hotel room.

03:36.340 --> 03:38.780
We think he might have a list
of all the FULCRUM agents

03:38.820 --> 03:39.820
that were blackmailing him.

03:39.860 --> 03:40.900
Wow. Okay.

03:40.980 --> 03:42.060
Can we talk about
this tomorrow?

03:42.140 --> 03:43.460
Because I have Jill

03:43.540 --> 03:44.660
waiting for me in the car.
Of course.

03:44.740 --> 03:45.900
Okay, thanks.

03:45.980 --> 03:47.740
Uh, Chuck...

03:47.820 --> 03:50.540
is everything all right?

03:50.620 --> 03:53.180
Yeah... yeah, I'm fine.
Why do you ask?

03:53.260 --> 03:54.900
Or is this some spy thing?

03:54.940 --> 03:56.420
Some psych evaluation
or something like that?

03:56.500 --> 03:58.300
It's a friend thing.

03:58.340 --> 04:00.060
I just want to make sure
you're okay.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.940
Yeah. Yeah, I'm great.

04:02.980 --> 04:05.900
Being with Jill,
is... is...

04:05.980 --> 04:07.700
It's like having
my old life back, you know?

04:07.780 --> 04:09.100
And not to bash
on our cover,

04:09.180 --> 04:12.220
but I'd forgotten
what it's like to be

04:12.300 --> 04:14.540
with someone who
knows the real me.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.620
Well, from everything
I've seen,

04:16.700 --> 04:18.260
she seems like a great girl.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.820
Well, if you could
see a little less.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.300
Maybe ease up
on the whole

04:21.380 --> 04:23.140
Chuck Bartowski
24-hour surveillance.

04:23.220 --> 04:25.700
Yeah, I'll talk to Casey.

04:25.740 --> 04:27.700
You deserve your
privacy, Chuck.

04:27.780 --> 04:28.820
Thank you.

04:30.820 --> 04:32.660
Okay.

04:57.780 --> 04:59.620
So Sarah said there's going to be

04:59.700 --> 05:01.060
an easing up
of the Chuck surveillance.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.460
You're a government
asset, Chuck.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.100
Sometimes your personal life
has to take a backseat.

05:04.140 --> 05:05.140
We tried the backseat.

05:05.220 --> 05:06.740
You have a camera
in the car, too.

05:06.820 --> 05:08.260
Come on, how many...
how many second chances

05:08.340 --> 05:09.900
do you get with
the one who got away?

05:09.980 --> 05:11.860
Plus, she already knows
I'm a... you know.

05:11.940 --> 05:14.220
I'm not even interested in
my own feelings, Bartowski.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.580
Keep your mind
on the mission.

05:15.660 --> 05:16.700
We leave in ten.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.340
Hey, Chuck.
Morning.

05:18.420 --> 05:20.060
Canada has just delivered

05:20.140 --> 05:22.460
its most delightful gift
since Shania Twain.

05:24.420 --> 05:27.820
Behold the Q-36 game copier.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.900
Check it out-- now all we
have to do is rent a game,

05:29.940 --> 05:32.380
rip it, and we never have to pay
for our entertainment again.

05:32.460 --> 05:34.900
Yeah, Big Mike's going
to be thrilled

05:34.940 --> 05:36.940
seeing as how we sell
video games.

05:36.980 --> 05:38.540
Come on, dude,
this thing can ignore

05:38.580 --> 05:39.860
all forms of copy protection.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.340
It can copy anything.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.140
Highly illegal.

05:43.180 --> 05:45.220
What's illegal, gentlemen?

05:45.300 --> 05:48.580
Oh. Going to smoke some weed
on your lunch break?

05:49.900 --> 05:50.820
A little reefer?

05:50.900 --> 05:51.820
Ganja?

05:53.220 --> 05:54.700
I have heard the loading dock

05:54.780 --> 05:56.180
is like
a Five for Fighting concert.

05:58.020 --> 05:59.140
So fierce.

05:59.220 --> 06:00.660
Chuck, can I see you

06:00.740 --> 06:02.100
in my office, please?

06:02.180 --> 06:03.220
Uh, sorry, Emmett, can't.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.460
Got to go.

06:04.500 --> 06:05.820
Oh, really? Where?

06:05.900 --> 06:08.020
Uh... it's an off-site
install.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.900
It's probably going
to take a while, so...

06:09.940 --> 06:11.740
See ya.

06:15.260 --> 06:18.420
You're going to a hotel
tonight with your cover girlfriend?

06:18.500 --> 06:22.100
Well, uh, you know, I mean,
if it's any comfort...

06:22.180 --> 06:24.220
overnight missions
normally involve Casey

06:24.260 --> 06:25.620
and a whole lot
of firearms.

06:25.660 --> 06:27.940
So, nothing romantic about it.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.500
So what is this Sarah like?

06:31.580 --> 06:33.260
Is she pretty?

06:33.300 --> 06:39.140
Um, well... I could understand
how a typical heterosexual male

06:39.220 --> 06:41.100
might find her aesthetically
pleasing, you know.

06:41.180 --> 06:42.900
And if someone
were to ask me,

06:42.980 --> 06:44.140
"Chuck, technically,
objectively,

06:44.220 --> 06:46.500
do you find your CIA
handler Sarah attractive?"

06:46.540 --> 06:47.740
Then I might say,
"Technically, objectively...

06:50.220 --> 06:51.580
...Sure."

06:51.620 --> 06:52.860
Uh-huh.

06:54.780 --> 06:57.420
And all those
missions you go on,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.580
it's not exciting
and romantic?

06:59.620 --> 07:02.420
Look, you got it all wrong.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.060
There is nothing
about this job

07:04.100 --> 07:06.060
that's glamorous or sexy.

07:07.660 --> 07:08.820
All right.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.380
Hi-oh.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.078
Was it absolutely necessary

08:03.118 --> 08:04.598
for you to dress up
like a...?

08:04.678 --> 08:06.518
An escort?
- Yeah, yeah, an escort.

08:06.598 --> 08:09.238
And why exactly is Mr. Carmichael
paying you to have sex with me...

08:09.318 --> 08:11.758
...him?
The Waldron is notorious

08:11.798 --> 08:13.478
for its high-end businessmen
and their trysts.

08:13.558 --> 08:14.598
It's our cover, so sell it.

08:17.158 --> 08:19.398
Wonder how much
that costs?

08:23.118 --> 08:24.838
I've got the security feed.

08:24.918 --> 08:27.718
It looks like the FBI
has Guy's room on lockdown.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.518
We won't be asking
permission before we slip in.

08:30.598 --> 08:32.878
We'll just enter through
the ventilation system.

08:38.878 --> 08:40.837
Hey, hey...

08:40.918 --> 08:42.918
how long is this
going to take?

08:42.957 --> 08:44.558
What's the matter,
Bartowski, you got a date?

08:44.638 --> 08:46.598
Actually, yes.

08:46.678 --> 08:47.718
Ow!
You okay?

08:47.758 --> 08:48.678
Why don't you just call ahead

08:48.758 --> 08:49.798
and let them know we're coming?

08:49.878 --> 08:52.838
Sorry.
Idiot.

08:52.918 --> 08:54.798
I'm just trying to figure out
what time I'm going to be home.

08:54.878 --> 08:55.998
Well, just do
the cover math.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.598
How long would it take
for a businessman

08:57.678 --> 08:59.878
to have sex
with a prostitute?

08:59.958 --> 09:01.598
Stupid phone.

09:08.358 --> 09:10.038
Hello?

09:10.078 --> 09:11.798
Sarah, you think
this shouldn't take us

09:11.878 --> 09:14.238
more than an hour to have sex
from start to finish?

09:14.318 --> 09:15.238
Uh-huh.

09:15.318 --> 09:17.118
And...

09:17.198 --> 09:18.878
begin.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.758
What... what am I...

09:21.838 --> 09:23.118
What am I doing wrong here?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.438
Well, just move your hips
a little to the left.

09:27.518 --> 09:29.118
Okay... okay.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.198
This is way more exhausting
than I thought it would be.

09:33.238 --> 09:34.718
Well, we can't
just race right through it.

09:34.798 --> 09:36.918
Your knees aren't hurting?

09:36.998 --> 09:39.478
What, did you go to a school
to learn how to do this?

09:47.198 --> 09:48.118
Hey, how are you?

09:48.198 --> 09:49.918
Hello, Emmett.

09:49.998 --> 09:52.398
I was just coming in here
to get a snack.

09:52.478 --> 09:54.598
Oh, you do not need a snack.
Please.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.118
Okay.

09:59.678 --> 10:03.358
Morgan, I want you
to imagine, for a moment,

10:03.398 --> 10:05.078
that Buy More is a country.

10:05.158 --> 10:07.038
Ah, BuyMoria.

10:07.078 --> 10:08.838
Yes.

10:08.878 --> 10:09.838
How did you know that?

10:09.918 --> 10:11.398
I've thought about it for years.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.478
This is fantastic.

10:15.038 --> 10:16.998
Now, imagine that

10:17.078 --> 10:18.918
all its employees

10:18.958 --> 10:20.718
are the states that make up
this great nation.

10:20.758 --> 10:22.718
Yeah, I can dig it.

10:22.798 --> 10:25.438
And, if you will,
one of these states

10:25.518 --> 10:27.518
is looking to secede
from the union.

10:28.838 --> 10:30.558
Chuck.
Whoa.

10:30.638 --> 10:31.878
Okay, wait a minute.

10:31.958 --> 10:32.798
You're questioning
Chuck's patriotism

10:32.838 --> 10:33.918
towards BuyMoria? No.

10:33.998 --> 10:35.638
Where does he go
all the time?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.078
I don't see receipts for all
the off-site installs he does.

10:38.158 --> 10:40.038
What is he into, Morgan?

10:40.118 --> 10:41.158
Uppers? Glue?

10:41.238 --> 10:42.438
A baby mama?

10:42.518 --> 10:43.918
Dude, you are out of your mind.

10:43.998 --> 10:46.158
Maybe I am.

10:46.238 --> 10:48.198
Maybe I'm so far out of my mind

10:48.278 --> 10:50.758
that I've gotten myself
all crawled up inside of yours.

10:52.518 --> 10:53.878
Let's see.

10:53.918 --> 10:55.038
Oh.

10:56.478 --> 10:57.758
This could be grounds
for deportation

10:57.798 --> 10:59.398
from BuyMoria.

10:59.478 --> 11:01.398
You wouldn't.

11:01.478 --> 11:03.278
Help me, Morgan.

11:03.358 --> 11:04.558
Help me help Chuck.

11:06.758 --> 11:07.798
Chuck doesn't need our help.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.638
Don't matter what she said.

11:11.678 --> 11:12.958
Afternoon guard
duty is boring.

11:16.078 --> 11:16.918
Here.

11:16.998 --> 11:19.038
What are you doing up there?

11:19.078 --> 11:21.278
Help!

11:21.358 --> 11:23.078
Shh! It's the FBI.

11:23.118 --> 11:23.958
They're dumb,
not deaf.

11:24.038 --> 11:24.918
Thanks.

12:00.638 --> 12:01.398
Sorry.

12:26.198 --> 12:27.038
Hey. Hey.

12:34.118 --> 12:35.838
And then she
shoves him in the pool.

12:35.918 --> 12:37.478
I swear, if it wasn't
for the Xanax,

12:37.518 --> 12:38.798
she would have
ripped his...

12:38.878 --> 12:40.238
Hey, man.

12:40.318 --> 12:42.558
I didn't expect
to see you today.

12:42.638 --> 12:44.358
Well, never a day off
when you need it.

12:56.198 --> 12:57.558
Ow!

12:57.638 --> 12:59.118
Shh! Shh! Shh!

13:10.478 --> 13:13.838
Does the word "silent" have
a different meaning in geek

13:13.918 --> 13:15.158
that I'm not aware of?
- Look, I'm sorry.

13:15.198 --> 13:16.158
I thought it was on vibrate.

13:16.238 --> 13:17.838
At least I got the list.

13:17.918 --> 13:20.398
It's a Venetian Puzzle Box.

13:20.478 --> 13:22.198
Very popular with
Renaissance spies.

13:22.278 --> 13:24.638
It's locked.

13:24.718 --> 13:26.078
Hey-- beh, beh, beh.

13:26.158 --> 13:27.678
The running, jumping, shooting
people part of the job,

13:27.758 --> 13:28.638
that's all you guys.

13:28.718 --> 13:30.238
But the puzzles, that's all me.

13:30.318 --> 13:31.998
I think it would be

13:32.078 --> 13:34.238
numerals one through
12 in a row.

13:34.278 --> 13:35.398
But these boxes used

13:35.478 --> 13:37.558
a complicated
Fibonacci sequence.

13:46.198 --> 13:48.558
Let's see what we got.

13:54.718 --> 13:56.838
Oh, Casey, gas!

13:56.918 --> 13:58.838
Be right back with a containment unit.
- Well, is it off?!

13:58.878 --> 14:00.398
Get it off me!
Take your clothes off!

14:00.438 --> 14:02.838
Get in the shower now, quick!
Off! Get it off!

14:02.878 --> 14:03.918
Pants off, come on!
I'm trying!

14:03.998 --> 14:05.078
Hurry up!

14:05.158 --> 14:06.438
Get in, get
in, get in.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.238
Oh, cold! So-so-so cold!

14:08.278 --> 14:09.278
Use the soap!

14:09.358 --> 14:10.278
Wash it!
Oh! Oh!

14:10.318 --> 14:11.758
Get the--
Oh, sorry, sorry!

14:11.838 --> 14:13.358
I'm trying to--
I'm not trying to...!

14:13.438 --> 14:15.318
Wash your face properly.

14:15.398 --> 14:16.558
Tastes like soap!
Tastes like soap!

14:16.638 --> 14:17.518
In your hair.

14:19.718 --> 14:20.758
Oh! Oh, God.

14:35.478 --> 14:36.998
Get the door. That's Casey.

14:37.038 --> 14:38.718
We have no time
to waste; quick.

14:41.318 --> 14:42.358
Jill.

14:42.438 --> 14:43.958
Chuck.
How'd you...

14:44.038 --> 14:46.558
The bellman sent me
to your room.

14:54.358 --> 14:56.478
I knew it.

14:56.558 --> 14:57.998
Jill, wait!

14:58.078 --> 14:59.278
Wait, wait! It's
not what you think!

14:59.358 --> 15:00.478
Jill, please!

15:00.558 --> 15:01.598
I could be dying!

15:07.774 --> 15:09.654
How long... how long
does this thing take?

15:09.734 --> 15:11.854
How-how does Jill pick that
exact moment to walk in on us?

15:11.934 --> 15:13.614
I mean, what-what-
what are the odds?

15:13.654 --> 15:15.214
Does-does this, does this
give us the antidote?

15:15.294 --> 15:16.894
Because I think
I feel my throat

15:16.974 --> 15:18.494
is closing up on me right now.

15:21.014 --> 15:21.974
What is it?

15:22.054 --> 15:22.974
What is it,
flesh-eating bacteria

15:23.054 --> 15:23.974
or anthrax?

15:24.054 --> 15:25.254
Am I gonna die?

15:25.334 --> 15:26.734
Nope.
But you can add ice

15:26.774 --> 15:28.814
and give it to little kids
to sell on street corners.

15:28.894 --> 15:31.054
I knew it.

15:31.134 --> 15:32.694
Drugs.

15:32.774 --> 15:35.054
It's powdered fruit punch,
dumb ass.

15:35.134 --> 15:36.894
Wait...

15:36.974 --> 15:38.614
So not only

15:38.654 --> 15:40.334
did we not get
the FULCRUM list,

15:40.414 --> 15:42.694
but Jill's never gonna speak to
me again because she caught me

15:42.774 --> 15:44.654
naked, rinsing off fruit punch
with another woman?

15:46.054 --> 15:47.414
Common spy problem.

15:47.454 --> 15:49.254
Really?

15:50.894 --> 15:52.574
I don't know what to tell you.

15:52.654 --> 15:53.614
I don't know anything.

15:53.694 --> 15:55.534
Oh, of course you do, Lester.

15:55.614 --> 15:57.614
You've worked
very closely with Charles

15:57.694 --> 15:59.014
for years.

15:59.094 --> 16:01.174
Perhaps I've overstated
the nature of our relationship.

16:01.254 --> 16:02.734
We don't socialize much.

16:02.774 --> 16:04.854
In fact, I've felt slighted
on more than one occasion.

16:04.934 --> 16:06.214
Oh, good.

16:06.294 --> 16:08.334
Then you won't have a problem
ratting him out.

16:08.374 --> 16:10.294
I have no ethical dilemma.

16:10.374 --> 16:11.614
I meant I just don't
know anything!

16:11.694 --> 16:12.774
Then who does?!

16:12.814 --> 16:14.214
Jeff!
I would ask Jeff.

16:14.294 --> 16:15.334
I don't rat.

16:15.414 --> 16:16.454
Only thing
my mother

16:16.494 --> 16:17.654
taught me from
the joint.

16:17.734 --> 16:20.574
You want answers,
talk to the Injun.

16:20.654 --> 16:23.094
"Injun" is a highly
derogatory term

16:23.134 --> 16:24.174
referring to
Native Americans,

16:24.254 --> 16:25.494
not East Indians,
you cretin!

16:25.534 --> 16:27.254
Grab a shiv and make your move.

16:27.294 --> 16:28.806
We should run now.
He's in "prison mode."

16:28.807 --> 16:29.094
Shut up.

16:29.174 --> 16:31.134
I guess I haven't
made myself clear.

16:31.174 --> 16:34.454
You both host an
unsanctioned card game

16:34.534 --> 16:35.574
in this break room.

16:35.614 --> 16:37.974
You give me something
on Bartowski

16:38.054 --> 16:39.774
or no more poker night.

16:41.414 --> 16:43.054
Chuck's cheating on his lady.

16:44.534 --> 16:46.134
Yeah, we saw him and
this brunette bird

16:46.214 --> 16:47.614
leaving some fancy,
real-silverware joint

16:47.654 --> 16:48.774
a couple of
nights ago.

16:48.854 --> 16:50.894
She's not as well-endowed
as I would like.

16:50.974 --> 16:51.894
Come on.

16:51.974 --> 16:53.134
What's her name?

16:53.214 --> 16:54.094
Who is she?

16:57.694 --> 16:59.934
No more poker

17:00.014 --> 17:01.934
No...
Morgan!

17:02.014 --> 17:03.214
You got to break Morgan.

17:03.294 --> 17:04.253
Chuck tells him everything.

17:04.334 --> 17:06.654
His beard holds so many secrets.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.134
Morgan.

17:09.174 --> 17:10.013
Hey, Jill.

17:10.094 --> 17:11.973
It's-It's me again-- Chuck.

17:12.054 --> 17:13.134
Lucky message number four.

17:13.174 --> 17:14.574
Listen, I just wanted to say,

17:14.654 --> 17:16.134
I totally understand why
you're not calling me back.

17:16.214 --> 17:17.654
Because, look,
if I saw what you saw,

17:17.733 --> 17:19.374
then I'd be thinking
what you're thinking, you know.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.054
Not that I presume to know
what you're thinking.

17:21.134 --> 17:23.454
It's just a logical deduction
to think what you saw would be

17:23.534 --> 17:25.414
what you think, if that's
in fact what you're thinking.

17:25.454 --> 17:28.094
Actually, I can explain
a lot better than that,

17:28.174 --> 17:29.934
if you just call me back.

17:30.014 --> 17:31.174
Please.

17:31.254 --> 17:32.654
At your earliest convenience.

17:32.694 --> 17:34.454
Bye.

17:39.614 --> 17:40.454
Grimes.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.134
You got to give Milbarge
something, man.

17:43.174 --> 17:44.694
If you don't,

17:44.774 --> 17:46.814
he's not gonna let us
have our weekly poker game.

17:46.894 --> 17:49.134
Yeah, don't do it
for us, Morgan.

17:49.174 --> 17:50.214
Do it for BuyMoria.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.094
So, Grimes,

17:54.174 --> 17:56.094
have you thought any more
about our chat this morning?

17:56.174 --> 17:58.734
Are you ready to help me
help BuyMoria?

17:58.814 --> 18:00.534
Yeah, okay, Emmett.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.094
Okay.

18:04.134 --> 18:07.694
You want to know where Chuck
goes on these... service calls?

18:07.734 --> 18:09.014
Yes, please.

18:11.334 --> 18:12.974
He goes and he
fixes computers

18:13.054 --> 18:14.734
and computer-
related software.

18:16.254 --> 18:17.374
Why do you protect him?

18:17.454 --> 18:18.894
What does that Charles
have over you?

18:18.974 --> 18:21.334
Um, 23 years
of best friendship.

18:21.374 --> 18:22.494
Oh, please.
I know everything

18:22.574 --> 18:23.894
there is to know
about the man, but

18:23.974 --> 18:25.614
you're not gonna hear it
from me. And if you're

18:25.654 --> 18:26.734
looking for dirt,
well, nothing to say,

18:26.814 --> 18:27.814
dude, 'cause
Chuck Bartowski

18:27.894 --> 18:29.494
is the straightest
shooter I know.

18:30.654 --> 18:32.054
Really?

18:32.094 --> 18:33.174
That's right.

18:33.254 --> 18:34.734
You have a bizarre sense
of straightest.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.934
Since your besty
has two girlfriends.

18:38.134 --> 18:39.734
What are you talking about?

18:39.814 --> 18:41.734
I mean, isn't Bartowski's bimbo
a blonde?

18:41.814 --> 18:43.974
I don't know if Sarah's
a natural blonde.

18:44.054 --> 18:45.654
I mean, it's kind of
impolite to ask, you know.

18:47.174 --> 18:48.574
Oh, my God, it's Jill.

18:48.654 --> 18:49.934
Thank you.
I didn't know its name.

18:51.534 --> 18:53.934
That's, that's Chuck's
old college girlfriend.

18:53.974 --> 18:55.534
Thank you again.

18:55.574 --> 18:57.054
You're a font
of information.

18:57.134 --> 18:59.014
Twice the intelligence
I had before.

18:59.094 --> 19:01.414
How could he
not have told me?

19:01.454 --> 19:03.494
Oh, you can have
your poker game now.

19:03.574 --> 19:05.094
And do not worry.

19:05.174 --> 19:06.774
I will not tell Bartowski

19:06.854 --> 19:08.614
that his best buddy
was the weak link.

19:08.694 --> 19:10.654
Cheers.

19:12.774 --> 19:14.014
Sorry. Okay.

19:14.094 --> 19:15.454
Jill, thank you,

19:15.494 --> 19:16.974
thank you, thank you so much
for-for coming, Jill.

19:17.054 --> 19:18.174
I appreciate it.

19:18.254 --> 19:19.494
You have three seconds
to convince me

19:19.534 --> 19:20.774
what I saw wasn't
what I saw.

19:22.254 --> 19:23.534
That's gonna be a little tough,

19:23.574 --> 19:24.774
because I can't
get into specifics

19:24.814 --> 19:25.974
without you having
to know, like,

19:26.014 --> 19:27.654
really high-level,
top-secret government...

19:27.734 --> 19:29.014
We broke into Guy's room
trying to find

19:29.094 --> 19:30.414
some of his research,
and we found

19:30.454 --> 19:32.414
this box, but when we opened it,
it sprayed this stuff

19:32.494 --> 19:34.974
all over Sarah and I,
so when you saw the two of us in

19:35.014 --> 19:36.454
our underpants what you
really saw was two people

19:36.494 --> 19:38.094
trying to wash off
what we thought was poison but

19:38.174 --> 19:39.454
really turned out to be
powdered fruit punch.

19:39.494 --> 19:40.454
See? There. Simple.
Do you believe me?

19:40.534 --> 19:42.694
What kind of fruit punch?

19:42.774 --> 19:44.494
Okay, now you're just
messing with me.

19:44.534 --> 19:45.894
No, no. Chuck, I believe you.

19:45.974 --> 19:47.334
Really? Becau--

19:47.414 --> 19:49.414
I-I was listening to
what I just said right now,

19:49.494 --> 19:50.334
and I sounded
completely ridiculous.

19:50.414 --> 19:52.774
Guy was crazy paranoid.

19:52.854 --> 19:54.854
You couldn't open an e-mail
without solving a puzzle first.

19:54.934 --> 19:57.494
If he cared about something,
he would have hidden it.

19:57.574 --> 19:58.974
Maybe the fruit punch
was a clue.

19:59.054 --> 20:01.614
We have to go somewhere.

20:01.694 --> 20:03.614
But before we do,

20:03.694 --> 20:05.214
how do you feel
about blindfolds?

20:13.734 --> 20:15.094
You brought her here?

20:15.174 --> 20:18.334
Um...

20:18.414 --> 20:19.814
Bartowski, it's not
a secret location

20:19.894 --> 20:21.254
if you invite people over.

20:21.294 --> 20:25.214
Okay, but Jill here,
Jill knows about Guy's puzzles.

20:25.294 --> 20:27.614
They just found two dead FBI
agents in LaFleur's room.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.574
Now's not the time to be planning
game night with your girlfriend.

20:30.654 --> 20:32.374
Jill, would you please
tell them what you told me,

20:32.454 --> 20:35.454
about how the fruit punch
might actually be a clue.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.894
Guy's paranoia manifested
itself in obscure ways:

20:37.974 --> 20:39.894
odd literary references,
mathematical proofs.

20:39.974 --> 20:41.414
The log-on for
his computer was

20:41.494 --> 20:43.734
a randomly selected word
from a piece of Vogon poetry.

20:43.814 --> 20:46.014
So what do you think
the fruit punch might mean?

20:46.054 --> 20:47.534
What kind of fruit
punch was it?

20:47.614 --> 20:51.854
Uh, I guess,
traditional fruit punch.

20:51.894 --> 20:53.294
You guess?

20:53.374 --> 20:55.694
Please tell me
you got the exact formula.

20:58.054 --> 20:59.334
Okay, um,

20:59.414 --> 21:01.054
is there a mass spectrometer
around?

21:01.134 --> 21:03.454
Casey, get the spectrometer.

21:03.534 --> 21:04.774
Do we have one of those?

21:13.334 --> 21:15.734
I can see what the boy
sees in her, huh?

21:15.814 --> 21:18.174
Now we compare the crystalline
powder's chemical composition

21:18.254 --> 21:20.534
with a list of
known products.

21:29.894 --> 21:33.134
It's, um, it's
Rootin' Raspberry-flavored Hi-C.

21:38.574 --> 21:40.014
Rootin' Raspberry?

21:40.094 --> 21:42.254
Maybe... Maybe it has something
to do with a football team

21:42.334 --> 21:43.214
or cheerleaders?

21:43.294 --> 21:44.854
What about international waters?

21:44.934 --> 21:46.494
High seas.

21:46.574 --> 21:47.814
That's good.
That's good.

21:47.894 --> 21:49.654
Wait, guys, guys,
this is a music box.

21:49.734 --> 21:51.494
It's a music box.

21:51.574 --> 21:53.054
It's not high sea-- S-E-A.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.974
It's high "C," like
a musical note-- high "C."

21:56.054 --> 21:57.214
Where's a pitch pipe
when you need one?

22:02.534 --> 22:05.294
Hey! What?

22:05.334 --> 22:06.214
Choir boy.

22:07.934 --> 22:10.294
What? I wasn't hatched.

22:12.654 --> 22:14.614
Ha-ha-ha!

22:14.694 --> 22:15.734
Check it out!

22:15.814 --> 22:17.734
Those are opera glasses.

22:22.214 --> 22:23.854
Oh! No...

22:23.934 --> 22:25.534
actually, they're not.

22:25.614 --> 22:27.414
Um, this is a key.

22:27.454 --> 22:29.614
A key to a very super secret
lock box.

22:31.014 --> 22:33.294
The Culper Ring used to use
stuff like that to pass

22:33.334 --> 22:34.934
information during the
Revolutionary War days.

22:35.014 --> 22:38.334
Wow, Chuck, that's impressive.

22:38.414 --> 22:39.734
Yeah, nice going there, brainiac.

22:39.814 --> 22:41.974
But before you go getting
all full of yourself--

22:42.014 --> 22:44.534
if this is the key,
where's the lock?

22:44.574 --> 22:48.814
The question, my dear Casey is:
Where's the opera?

22:55.814 --> 22:59.054
You're not concerned
to involve a civilian

22:59.094 --> 23:01.334
in a covert government
investigation?

23:01.414 --> 23:03.694
Ah, the girl's
personal knowledge

23:03.774 --> 23:05.854
of Guy LaFleur makes
her of use to us.

23:05.894 --> 23:07.694
You sure you're not
just jealous

23:07.774 --> 23:09.534
Bartowski's found himself
a new piece of asset?

23:11.574 --> 23:12.774
Now where is that doofus?

23:17.734 --> 23:19.614
Guy loved the opera.
Here's his family's box.

23:19.694 --> 23:22.534
Whoa! Not bad.

23:22.614 --> 23:24.134
You really feel like you're on
top of the action.

23:25.934 --> 23:27.494
How do you know what
you're looking for?

23:27.574 --> 23:28.974
Oh, well...

23:29.014 --> 23:31.014
it'll match
the end of this key.

23:31.054 --> 23:32.974
You know, something...

23:33.054 --> 23:35.334
something...

23:39.294 --> 23:40.734
...like this.

23:47.334 --> 23:48.854
Shall we see what we got?

24:02.294 --> 24:04.254
Bingo.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.454
Hey, we got it!

24:12.494 --> 24:13.894
Mr. Kolfi, we'll be out
of your hair

24:13.974 --> 24:15.174
in a minute, okay?
I don't have a minute.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.374
We are trying to rehearse.

24:16.454 --> 24:17.534
This is a quick,
quick, quick minute.

24:17.614 --> 24:18.734
You know, government stuff.

24:19.894 --> 24:20.734
Watch out.

24:28.414 --> 24:30.654
Casey, that's a bomb.

24:38.574 --> 24:39.734
All right, rehearsal's over.
Everyone out of here!

24:39.814 --> 24:40.934
Come on, Chuck, let's go!
We gotta go!

24:41.014 --> 24:42.374
Wait!
This doesn't make any sense.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.174
Guy wanted to help people,
not hurt them.

24:44.254 --> 24:45.614
This isn't a bomb,
this is a clue.

24:45.654 --> 24:47.094
Jill, if it looks like a bomb

24:47.174 --> 24:49.174
and it ticks like a bomb,
then generally it's a bomb.

24:49.254 --> 24:51.894
No, this is a puzzle we need to
solve before the timer runs out.

24:51.974 --> 24:52.894
And what if you're wrong?

24:52.974 --> 24:54.774
That doesn't happen.

24:59.174 --> 25:00.894
Look, it's a music thing.
What's the opera?

25:00.934 --> 25:02.374
Verdi's La Traviata.

25:02.454 --> 25:03.974
Well, how does that go?

25:04.054 --> 25:05.574
You play violin, right?
- Mm-hmm.

25:08.654 --> 25:10.254
Your dad made you play
the flute.

25:10.334 --> 25:11.294
Let's not bring that up.

25:13.654 --> 25:15.614
Come on. Come on.
Get 'em all out!

25:15.694 --> 25:17.054
All of 'em!
Go, go!

25:22.574 --> 25:23.894
It's not happening.

25:23.934 --> 25:25.894
Let's go.
Chuck, come on!

25:25.934 --> 25:27.174
Look, look, Jill has yet
to be wrong, okay?

25:27.254 --> 25:28.374
She says it's not a bomb,

25:28.454 --> 25:29.414
I believe her.

25:32.974 --> 25:34.574
Sir, we're sealing
this place off.

25:44.534 --> 25:46.494
It's a flash drive.
This must be it.

25:49.134 --> 25:50.574
That's how we
do that, huh?

25:50.654 --> 25:52.334
Jill, it was all you.

25:52.414 --> 25:53.974
No, you.
It was all you.

25:55.854 --> 25:56.814
Okay, all right, all right.

25:58.694 --> 26:00.774
I love love.

26:02.934 --> 26:04.814
The flash drive containing
Guy's list is encrypted

26:04.894 --> 26:07.654
using a 512-bit AES cipher.

26:07.734 --> 26:10.534
Right now, the computer is
trying every possible key

26:10.574 --> 26:11.774
against the encrypted data.

26:11.854 --> 26:14.094
When it finds a match,
we'll have the identity

26:14.174 --> 26:16.614
of every FULCRUM agent
with whom Guy was in contact.

26:16.654 --> 26:17.774
How long will
that take?

26:17.814 --> 26:19.294
Could be hours,
could be days.

26:19.374 --> 26:20.934
Excellent work, you two.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.974
Please thank the asset
for his service.

26:23.054 --> 26:24.774
Where is Chuck
right now?

26:24.854 --> 26:27.254
My guess would be rounding
second base.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.614
You were
brilliant tonight.

26:36.694 --> 26:38.574
No, you.

26:38.654 --> 26:40.974
Mm-mm, all you.

26:43.414 --> 26:46.574
Mm-mm-mm! No, no, no, I can't,
I can't, I can't do this.

26:46.654 --> 26:50.014
You don't have to do a thing.
It's gonna be all me.

26:50.094 --> 26:53.014
I... mm, that's very
gracious of you,

26:53.094 --> 26:54.494
but no, that's not
what I'm saying.

26:54.574 --> 26:56.254
I mean, I can't do this.

26:56.334 --> 26:59.614
I can't, I can't do this.

26:59.654 --> 27:01.854
Hey, come here.

27:01.894 --> 27:04.454
Come here.
Come here. Look...

27:04.494 --> 27:06.094
Buy More. Tomorrow.

27:06.134 --> 27:07.774
What time?

27:07.854 --> 27:10.614
Take the latent heat
of aquatic fusion...

27:10.694 --> 27:12.614
Is that in calories per gram?

27:12.694 --> 27:14.054
Of course.

27:14.134 --> 27:17.174
And then subtract the atomic
number of thulium.

27:18.454 --> 27:19.494
Got it?

27:19.574 --> 27:20.694
Mm-hmm.

27:20.774 --> 27:22.214
Okay, I'll see you then.

27:22.294 --> 27:23.294
Nerd code.

27:31.054 --> 27:32.574
Hm.

27:32.654 --> 27:34.654
Hey, hey, buddy,

27:34.694 --> 27:36.894
listen, I need you to cover
for me with Emmett today.

27:36.974 --> 27:38.014
Gotta cut out early.

27:38.094 --> 27:39.894
I see-- big night
with the lady, huh?

27:39.974 --> 27:41.654
Actually, uh, yeah.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.254
We're sneaking off for a
little romantic getaway.

27:43.334 --> 27:45.134
Oh, how sweet.

27:45.214 --> 27:48.214
So you and Sarah are taking
a little trip together, huh?

27:48.294 --> 27:49.894
Yeah, we're, uh...

27:49.974 --> 27:52.134
Just save it, Pinocchio.
I know you're seeing Jill.

27:52.174 --> 27:55.174
You what? You... How?

27:55.214 --> 27:57.014
How do you--
you know about Jill?

27:57.054 --> 27:59.494
Apparently, I'm the last one
to know, too.

27:59.574 --> 28:00.494
Milbarge knows about it.

28:00.574 --> 28:02.414
This is Jill.

28:02.454 --> 28:04.254
I spent months helping you
get over her.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.214
Look, Chuck, we're best friends,

28:06.254 --> 28:08.534
but if you're not telling me
about this, what else

28:08.614 --> 28:10.254
aren't you telling me?

28:12.094 --> 28:14.694
Morgan, I'm so sorry, buddy.

28:14.734 --> 28:16.774
I really am.
And-And trust me, there is so much

28:16.854 --> 28:18.414
that I wish
that I could tell you,

28:18.494 --> 28:19.934
but I, you know, can't.

28:19.974 --> 28:21.654
Dude, you've never lied
to me before.

28:21.734 --> 28:25.174
Exactly, so just trust
my judgment on this, okay?

28:26.814 --> 28:29.894
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I gotta go.

28:29.974 --> 28:30.974
Can you cover me?

28:31.014 --> 28:32.414
Of course, I can cover
for you, man,

28:32.454 --> 28:33.454
because we're best friends

28:33.534 --> 28:34.774
and that's what
best friends do--

28:34.814 --> 28:36.254
they lie for each other.

28:36.294 --> 28:37.974
But they don't lie
to each other,

28:38.054 --> 28:39.134
that's all.

28:39.214 --> 28:40.094
Got it.

28:41.854 --> 28:45.134
Trust me.
And thank you, thank you.

29:01.494 --> 29:03.454
I'm gonna grab some
turkey jerky inside.

29:03.534 --> 29:04.654
Do you want anything?

29:04.734 --> 29:07.174
Uh, a water
and some Gummi Bears.

29:07.214 --> 29:08.614
Okay, coming right up.

29:10.054 --> 29:11.254
Have you heard from Chuck?

29:11.294 --> 29:14.334
No. I'll do a GPS search
on his watch.

29:19.134 --> 29:20.294
Little twerp's gone off grid.

29:28.254 --> 29:30.174
Hey, no Gummi Bears,
so I hope you like sour...

29:30.214 --> 29:31.734
Chuck, help!

29:31.774 --> 29:32.734
Jill!

29:32.774 --> 29:33.814
That's close enough.

29:33.894 --> 29:35.374
You have something
that belongs to me.

29:35.454 --> 29:37.214
What? No. This?

29:37.294 --> 29:38.894
No, no, no. See, I paid--

29:38.974 --> 29:40.414
I paid for this.
But you can have it.

29:40.454 --> 29:41.694
Why don't you just
let the girl go

29:41.774 --> 29:43.094
and then you can tell me
what it is exactly

29:43.174 --> 29:44.534
that you've lost, then maybe
I can help you find it?

29:44.614 --> 29:46.894
Bring me LaFleur's list
or the girl dies.

29:46.974 --> 29:48.894
Opera House.

29:48.974 --> 29:49.934
Midnight.

30:01.745 --> 30:03.225
They took her!
The hell you been?

30:03.265 --> 30:05.345
You deliberately went off grid.
Some guy just took Jill!

30:05.425 --> 30:07.305
He said if I didn't bring him
Guy's list of

30:07.385 --> 30:08.545
FULCRUM agents,
he's gonna kill her.

30:08.625 --> 30:10.465
That's not gonna happen.
Yeah, of course not.

30:10.505 --> 30:12.505
I'm gonna bring him the list,
and I'm gonna get her back!

30:12.585 --> 30:14.065
No, you're not.

30:14.105 --> 30:15.385
They'll kill her either way.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.225
What? No.
That can't happen.

30:17.305 --> 30:18.505
Please, Casey,
will you please help me?

30:23.345 --> 30:24.505
No.

30:24.545 --> 30:26.665
I gotta call Washington
and report it.

30:26.745 --> 30:28.105
You stay right here.
Don't move.

30:28.145 --> 30:29.105
You've done
enough damage already.

30:35.985 --> 30:37.025
General,
we have a situation.

30:42.465 --> 30:44.065
Stop!

30:44.105 --> 30:45.265
Walker, shoot him!
Chuck, freeze!

30:45.345 --> 30:46.625
Don't.

30:46.665 --> 30:48.265
If you try to take that,
I have to stop you.

30:48.345 --> 30:50.305
Please, let me go!

30:50.345 --> 30:51.905
This is treason, Bartowski.

30:51.985 --> 30:52.865
Please, just let me go.

30:52.905 --> 30:54.505
Shoot him, Walker.

30:54.545 --> 30:55.745
Shoot him
in the knee.

31:00.865 --> 31:01.945
I'm sorry.

31:02.025 --> 31:02.865
I have to.

31:05.145 --> 31:07.265
It's Jill.

31:37.865 --> 31:39.305
You could've
shot him.

31:39.385 --> 31:40.345
He's the Intersect.

31:40.385 --> 31:42.145
Is that all he is?

31:42.185 --> 31:43.425
You could've at least
kneecapped him.

31:43.505 --> 31:45.345
I have a trace on Chuck.
He's heading downtown.

31:45.425 --> 31:47.305
You get the car,
I'll get the guns.

32:11.025 --> 32:12.745
Jill!

32:12.785 --> 32:14.105
Chuck.

32:14.185 --> 32:15.785
Can we dispense
with the pillow talk

32:15.825 --> 32:16.825
and just do this?

32:16.905 --> 32:18.105
Yeah, yeah,
okay, okay.

32:18.185 --> 32:19.425
Let her go.
Not so fast.

32:19.465 --> 32:21.545
You've seen mine,
now show me yours.

32:21.625 --> 32:24.745
That's fine, but first I need to
know that she's gonna be safe.

32:24.825 --> 32:26.265
That's not how this works.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.385
You hand over the list,
or I shoot you both.

32:28.465 --> 32:29.865
That's not how
this works either!

32:31.305 --> 32:33.145
Go wait in the car, Chuck.

32:33.225 --> 32:34.225
Don't move, Chuck.

32:35.345 --> 32:36.465
Stay right where you are.

32:36.505 --> 32:38.025
I've got a sharpshooter
trained on you.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.665
Now I have the sniper.

32:56.745 --> 32:57.865
I-I still have the advantage.

32:57.945 --> 33:00.265
Somebody give me the list,
or I shoot Chuck.

33:00.305 --> 33:01.625
Yeah, go ahead
and shoot him.

33:01.665 --> 33:03.345
You know, I was thinking about
shooting him myself.

33:03.425 --> 33:04.505
That's a great--
Why would you-- What, what?!

33:04.585 --> 33:05.985
What are you, crazy?!

33:06.065 --> 33:07.465
How about nobody,
how about nobody shoots Chuck?!

33:07.505 --> 33:08.665
I'm not Sarah, Chuck.

33:08.705 --> 33:11.545
Give him that list,

33:11.625 --> 33:13.385
and I will end your miserable
existence. It's your choice.

33:13.465 --> 33:14.865
Would you rather
I shoot the girl?

33:14.945 --> 33:16.265
Please don't.
I would rather you not shoot

33:16.345 --> 33:17.905
the girl-- just point
the gun back at me, please.

33:17.985 --> 33:19.105
No!

33:19.185 --> 33:20.065
No, go ahead, shoot the girl.

33:20.145 --> 33:21.185
Some situations,

33:21.225 --> 33:22.385
collateral damage
is unavoidable.

33:22.425 --> 33:24.105
No.
It's always avoidable.

33:24.185 --> 33:25.945
Look, I have it, okay?
Here it is.

33:26.025 --> 33:26.665
Right here, here's the list.
- Bartowski!

33:28.105 --> 33:30.065
Look, you got
a better plan?

33:30.145 --> 33:31.945
'Cause I'm not okay with
collateral damage right now.

33:32.025 --> 33:33.265
Here you go.

33:33.305 --> 33:35.705
Here's your list of all
the FULCRUM agents.

33:39.625 --> 33:43.345
Well, Mr. Casey,
FULCRUM would rather

33:43.385 --> 33:45.345
you not know who we have
inside government.

33:51.585 --> 33:53.185
Show must go on.
Now, Sarah!

33:55.385 --> 33:56.745
Okay. Hey, hey. You're okay.

34:02.785 --> 34:05.705
You're okay...

34:05.785 --> 34:07.705
Oh, I'm so sorry.

34:07.785 --> 34:09.705
I'm so sorry.
You okay?

34:09.745 --> 34:12.145
You okay? You okay?
You okay? You okay?

34:12.225 --> 34:14.344
I am now.

34:17.344 --> 34:19.025
Ah, poker night.
And all I had to do

34:19.105 --> 34:20.145
was rat out my best friend.

34:20.185 --> 34:22.425
I saw that, Grimes.

34:24.185 --> 34:26.065
Oh, don't worry.

34:26.145 --> 34:29.105
What's a card game without
a couple of brewskis?

34:29.185 --> 34:32.784
And by "couple,"
do you mean 14?

34:34.185 --> 34:35.105
Oh, God.

34:36.905 --> 34:38.745
Mmm. Mmm!

34:41.065 --> 34:43.425
I won't forget the loyalty
you showed, Grimes.

34:43.505 --> 34:45.105
Tonight, we drink.

34:45.145 --> 34:46.264
Tomorrow,
Bartowski gets his.

34:46.304 --> 34:47.105
Whatever, dude.

34:48.465 --> 34:49.985
Beer?
Oh, no.

34:50.065 --> 34:51.864
I brought my own. Whoo!

34:54.945 --> 34:56.864
Mmm.

34:56.945 --> 34:58.385
Mmm.

34:58.425 --> 34:59.825
Mmm.

34:59.905 --> 35:01.225
Tastes like high school!
- Donkeys wild.

35:01.305 --> 35:03.305
Let's go-- who's gonna put
the "poker" in "strip poker."

35:03.385 --> 35:05.665
Let's play it out, boys,
let's play it out.

35:07.745 --> 35:09.065
Are you sure you're okay?

35:09.145 --> 35:10.385
I think so.

35:10.465 --> 35:12.265
Is this a normal day
at the office for you?

35:12.345 --> 35:14.385
Yeah, except Casey
doesn't usually sing.

35:14.465 --> 35:15.705
Okay, first I'm gonna
have you arrested

35:15.785 --> 35:16.825
for crimes
against your country.

35:16.905 --> 35:18.145
Then I'll take you down
to Club Gitmo,

35:18.225 --> 35:19.705
hang you up by your fingernails
with the boys...

35:19.745 --> 35:21.265
Hey! I appreciate the threats,
I really do.

35:21.305 --> 35:22.785
But can I please explain myself?

35:22.865 --> 35:25.545
Explain what? You gave away
classified intel to the enemy.

35:25.585 --> 35:27.185
Now we're never gonna know
the identities

35:27.265 --> 35:28.345
of those FULCRUM agents.

35:28.425 --> 35:30.225
Ye of little faith.

35:30.305 --> 35:32.225
Casey, come on, buddy.

35:32.305 --> 35:33.785
Do you really think that I would

35:33.865 --> 35:35.785
give that guy
the list to destroy

35:35.865 --> 35:37.825
before I made myself a copy?

35:40.105 --> 35:41.425
Hey.
Q-36 game copier.

35:41.505 --> 35:43.505
Thankfully, Morgan is
too cheap and unethical

35:43.585 --> 35:45.145
to pay for his own
video game entertainment.

35:45.225 --> 35:48.305
Canada's greatest gift
since Shania Twain.

35:48.385 --> 35:50.705
Thank you for
saving my life.

35:50.745 --> 35:53.545
Sorry for not
trusting you with Chuck.

35:53.625 --> 35:55.025
You want to pay me back?

35:56.785 --> 35:58.425
Don't hurt him again.

35:58.505 --> 36:00.945
I won't.

36:01.025 --> 36:03.385
I wouldn't.

36:03.465 --> 36:05.785
I care about Chuck.

36:05.865 --> 36:08.985
Me, too.

36:09.065 --> 36:10.545
It's my job to protect him.

36:13.145 --> 36:15.425
From anything.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.141
Hey, Emmett.

36:30.181 --> 36:31.661
Stop screaming.

36:31.741 --> 36:34.581
Wow.

36:34.661 --> 36:36.181
Little too much fun
last night, huh, pal?

36:37.821 --> 36:40.221
I should never have gone
for that second Fuzzy Navel.

36:40.261 --> 36:43.821
That wine cooler had
four percent alcohol.

36:43.861 --> 36:45.821
I know. I know.

36:45.861 --> 36:47.501
I tell you what, though,

36:47.581 --> 36:49.461
let's talk about it,

36:49.541 --> 36:51.981
in my office.

36:52.061 --> 36:53.461
Yeah, come on.
This way.

36:56.501 --> 36:58.461
You know, I wanted to
talk to you today about

36:58.541 --> 37:00.181
a little technique
that we developed around here.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.261
It worked wonders
during the Harry Tang years.

37:02.341 --> 37:04.421
Can we talk about this
some other time, Grimes?

37:04.501 --> 37:05.581
You see, BuyMoria

37:05.621 --> 37:08.461
is a country
governed by law.

37:08.541 --> 37:11.901
But occasionally, a
vigilante hero has to rise

37:11.981 --> 37:15.141
and take that law
into his own hands to protect

37:15.221 --> 37:17.141
the country
that he loves.

37:17.221 --> 37:18.461
This is from last night.

37:18.501 --> 37:20.301
After poker.

37:22.341 --> 37:23.821
I'm Big Mike!

37:23.901 --> 37:25.301
What you doing here, Emmett?!

37:25.341 --> 37:27.701
Is that you in Big Mike's office
after hours?

37:27.741 --> 37:29.741
That's weird,
because

37:29.821 --> 37:31.741
I thought that was off-limits.

37:31.781 --> 37:33.061
Even to you.

37:33.141 --> 37:36.701
I didn't go six years

37:36.781 --> 37:40.301
to community college
to assistant manage

37:40.381 --> 37:42.661
a bunch of register jockeys!

37:44.701 --> 37:46.821
Oh, man, you do not look good.

37:51.061 --> 37:52.181
Now, I know
that we're...

37:52.261 --> 37:54.701
countrymen
and all.

37:54.781 --> 37:57.661
I hate to have to run
this up the flagpole.

37:57.701 --> 37:59.581
You wouldn't.

37:59.661 --> 38:00.741
Damn right I would.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.141
If you don't call off
this witch hunt

38:02.221 --> 38:03.101
for Chuck Bartowski,
this goes public.

38:03.141 --> 38:03.981
Do we understand each other?

38:06.541 --> 38:08.621
Good.

38:08.701 --> 38:10.781
Viva BuyMoria.

38:11.981 --> 38:13.501
Tastes like high school.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.661
Okay, computer's back up.

38:17.741 --> 38:19.421
It's decoding the list.
Just a matter of time

38:19.461 --> 38:21.181
before we learn the identities
of FULCRUM's agents.

38:30.781 --> 38:31.741
Ooh.

38:31.821 --> 38:32.981
Oh!

38:33.061 --> 38:34.501
Hey. Hey, yeah, hey.

38:34.581 --> 38:36.301
That's fine, I wasn't
gonna pack that one anyway.

38:39.541 --> 38:40.941
Oh, wait. Hey, no.

38:40.981 --> 38:42.261
The hotel's
booked, so...

38:42.341 --> 38:45.101
we should probably go
if we're gonna beat traffic!

38:45.181 --> 38:46.781
Or we could just get the weekend
started right now.

38:46.861 --> 38:48.581
Uh, what-what about,
what about the...

38:48.621 --> 38:51.901
Hm... I have some
spy moves of my own.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.661
We're gonna do this again?

39:01.701 --> 39:02.981
You know what?

39:03.061 --> 39:04.141
He had a big day today.

39:04.221 --> 39:05.221
How about we give him

39:05.301 --> 39:06.301
a little
break, huh?

39:09.541 --> 39:10.741
Encryption key's been found.

40:59.261 --> 41:01.541
Safe at last.
