WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:05.838
[Mac] So, how many restraining orders
does the waitress have on you?

00:05.923 --> 00:07.799
[Charlie] A lot, dude.
She's been irritated with me.

00:07.925 --> 00:10.093
"You got me fired from the
Oldies Rock Café. Guys.

00:10.219 --> 00:13.304
You're gonna get me fired from the coffee shop.
" This is incredible.

00:13.389 --> 00:17.308
Listen to this message. Come here.
This chick is so in love with me, it's crazy.

00:17.393 --> 00:19.310
[On Phone]
Hi, Dennis, it's Caylee.

00:19.395 --> 00:22.522
I was just calling to let you
know that I hope you die!

00:22.606 --> 00:25.525
You are obviously a terrible person
with no regard for anyone but yourself!

00:25.609 --> 00:29.028
I never, ever want to see you again,
you steaming pile of horseshit!

00:29.113 --> 00:31.197
Go to hell!
[Laughs]

00:31.323 --> 00:35.118
Whoa, that's amazing. That's the best one yet.
Yeah, it's a really good one.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.661
What?
She hates your guts.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.330
Dee, this chick is so in love with
me, she doesn't even know it.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.541
They don't get it because you
haven't explained it to them, bro.

00:41.625 --> 00:44.210
Oh, guys, I have a system,
a foolproof system...

00:44.294 --> 00:48.172
for getting any chick's undying
love and devotion for life.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.757
What the hell are you
talking about, dude?

00:49.842 --> 00:52.760
I'm talking about
the D.E.N.N.I.S. System.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.337
Ladies and gentlemen,
the D.E.N.N.I.S. System...

01:28.422 --> 01:32.425
is a comprehensive approach to seduction
that I have perfected over the years.

01:32.509 --> 01:36.596
See, my success with women does not solely
stem from my good looks and my charm.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.599
There is a careful,
systemic approach...

01:39.683 --> 01:42.560
that has allowed me to become
the playboy that I am today.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.730
- A playboy?
Is that how you see yourself? - Yes.

01:45.814 --> 01:49.025
He has banged a lot of chicks.
Just shut up, Dee. Shut up.

01:49.109 --> 01:54.405
Now, the first step to any erotic conquest
is to "D"- demonstrate your value.

01:54.490 --> 01:58.701
In this most recent case my subject
was Caylee, a cute pharmacist.

01:58.786 --> 02:02.079
[Dennis] I demonstrated my value
to her by filling a prescription.

02:02.164 --> 02:05.041
I told her, "It's for my grandmother.
She's quite ill."

02:05.125 --> 02:10.338
Thus demonstrating my value as a loving
grandson and an all-around great guy.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.299
- You're forging prescriptions now?
- That's the easy part, Dee.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.844
I would've gone in and bought
a box of magnum condoms,

02:16.929 --> 02:20.097
thus demonstrating that
I have a monster dong.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.391
Right. That comes of
a little bit desperate, Frank.

02:22.518 --> 02:26.771
Now, if you want to have a magnum condom
peeking out of your wallet when you go to pay,

02:26.855 --> 02:28.564
that's a different story.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.942
- [Frank] Oh, yeah.
- Now let's move on.

02:31.026 --> 02:35.112
Once you've demonstrated your value,
you are going to want to ask her out.

02:35.197 --> 02:39.158
Once you've asked her out,
you move on to "E."

02:39.243 --> 02:41.160
"Engage physically."

02:41.245 --> 02:44.163
I personally try to engage the girl
physically without ever going on the date,

02:44.248 --> 02:46.624
which to me is really
just a waste of time and money.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.961
[Dennis] I'll tell her I know this great little
restaurant that doesn't take reservations.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.963
That makes it sound cool,
makes it sound exclusive.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.465
And then when we get to the
restaurant, the restaurant is closed,

02:54.550 --> 02:57.218
as, of course,
it always is on Sundays.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.263
So I'll feign surprise and say
something along the lines of,

03:00.347 --> 03:04.350
"I guess we could grab a pizza
and watch a movie at my place."

03:04.476 --> 03:07.353
That's where I come in.
Oh, you're a part of this?

03:07.437 --> 03:10.314
Oh, yeah. Mac has a very
special place in my system.

03:10.399 --> 03:13.651
Yeah. You see, I'm on the couch when
they come in and ask to be alone.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.696
- Then I say- - I can't go in my room.
I found a black widow spider in there.

03:16.780 --> 03:20.533
Dennis fires back that he wants some privacy so
that they can get to know each other better.

03:20.617 --> 03:24.620
- [Dennis] And then I say- - Oh.
Well, I guess we could eat the pizza on my bed...

03:24.705 --> 03:26.706
and watch the DVD in my room.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.711
And once we're on my bed,
it is game over.

03:31.795 --> 03:35.298
I engage her physically
and the sexual waltz begins.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.801
Pizza's good.
You're the one that's good.

03:45.142 --> 03:48.686
Smooth! Very- Very smooth stuff.
Very classy.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.063
I'm learning a lot from
you right now, dude.

03:51.189 --> 03:56.277
Okay. Now, once you've had sex with a woman, she
will naturally start to depend on you. Okay?

03:56.361 --> 03:58.905
All women do this.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.157
They certainly do.
You got that right. [Laughing]

04:01.241 --> 04:02.825
Sex with women!

04:02.910 --> 04:04.827
Once you bang 'em,
you know- Like that.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.537
Right. Right.

04:06.622 --> 04:09.916
Which brings me
to the first "N."

04:10.000 --> 04:11.918
"Nurturing Dependence."

04:12.002 --> 04:15.922
You're gonna want to nurture that dependence
that she's feeling on you now, guys.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.089
Have her car towed.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.091
Or you can slash her tires.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.887
Either way, make her
depend on you for rides.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.889
Or you can use
my personal go-to,

04:24.973 --> 04:27.892
which is to create a fictional, angry
neighbor who is threatening her...

04:27.976 --> 04:30.144
and tell her
you'll take care of him.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.773
[Dennis] Hit up a pay phone so that she
can't trace the calls back to you.

04:33.857 --> 04:36.108
Give her a call and say
something along the lines of...

04:36.193 --> 04:40.446
[Sinister Voice] I'm watching you, you bitch.
You're gonna die tonight!

04:41.448 --> 04:43.491
[Sobbing]

04:45.786 --> 04:47.787
Oh, for Christ's sake!
You're a complete sociopath!

04:47.871 --> 04:49.956
Don't interrupt. Okay?

04:50.040 --> 04:52.500
Now, if you've completed all the other
steps properly up to this point,

04:52.584 --> 04:54.752
she'll naturally want to take the
relationship to the next level.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.879
But you're not gonna do that.
You're gonna do the exact opposite.

04:56.964 --> 05:00.091
Pull back, guys. Pull back.

05:00.175 --> 05:03.886
Which brings me to the second
"N," "Neglect Emotionally."

05:03.971 --> 05:05.763
You stop
taking her phone calls.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.640
Cancel all your plans.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.893
Maybe that fictional, angry neighbor
that you've simulated comes back,

05:10.978 --> 05:13.896
and this time you're not around
to cool him off.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.607
[Rings] Hello?

05:16.692 --> 05:18.943
[Sinister Voice]
Welcome to hell!

05:19.027 --> 05:22.029
[Sinister Laughing]

05:23.490 --> 05:26.200
[Sinister Laughing]

05:27.369 --> 05:29.286
This will frighten
the shit out of her.

05:29.371 --> 05:32.623
Okay? And she'll start getting really mixed
up because you're not there to protect her.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.667
She'll start questioning
her self-worth,

05:34.751 --> 05:36.919
start questioning her-
her self-esteem.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.296
And that's the perfect time
to "I"...

05:40.757 --> 05:42.591
"Inspire Hope."

05:42.676 --> 05:45.261
In Caylee's case, I went to
her window and I screamed...

05:45.345 --> 05:48.472
Caylee, listen.
Listen. Wait.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.892
I want to tell you that the reason
I was distant is because...

05:51.977 --> 05:55.146
I was afraid that you were
gonna break my heart...

05:55.230 --> 05:57.523
and I got scared.

05:57.607 --> 06:01.694
But I'm not scared
anymore, baby.

06:01.778 --> 06:05.156
I love you. I need you.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.075
And then, naturally, we bang.

06:08.160 --> 06:12.163
## [Slow Pop]

06:19.379 --> 06:25.092
# Watchin' every motion
in my foolish lover's gaze ##.

06:25.177 --> 06:28.554
And this is the best bang of all
because it's very emotional for her.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.390
You see, she thinks she's broken
through my tough exterior...

06:31.475 --> 06:35.561
and coerced affection from a
man who is afraid to love.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.190
And then I slink out
into the night,

06:39.274 --> 06:41.734
never to talk to her again.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.323
"Separate Entirely."

06:47.407 --> 06:49.575
Yes, Mac.
That's right.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.787
I "S"...

06:52.871 --> 06:54.663
"Separate Entirely."

06:54.748 --> 07:00.086
D-E-N-N-I-S.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.004
The D.E.N.N.I.S. System.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.382
That, my friends, is the key
to winning any girl's heart.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.676
Yeah! All right!
Good stuff.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.720
Better than I remember it.
Oh, good!

07:09.805 --> 07:12.223
Are you kidding me?
You are not winning their hearts.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.433
You're torturing them
and they end up hating you.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.394
Actually, Dee, they end up loving me more
than they ever thought was possible.

07:17.479 --> 07:20.064
And you set it up so you can get
these chicks back at any time?

07:20.148 --> 07:23.651
That's exactly right, Charlie.
You're really picking up on this. I'm proud of you, bud.

07:23.735 --> 07:27.113
There is no way that girl is gonna come back
to you after what you just put her through.

07:27.197 --> 07:31.117
I could absolutely get that girl back
anytime I want. I just choose not to.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.744
I 100% guarantee you
this girl's finished with you.

07:33.829 --> 07:36.413
Well, I take that as a challenge,
Dee, and I accept that challenge.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.416
- I'll have her back by the end of the day.
- Yeah. Dee, you don't get it.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.378
This is what men do!
This is what men do! Yeah!

07:42.462 --> 07:44.839
This is man stuff, Dee!
Man stuff!

07:44.965 --> 07:46.924
Whee!
Man stuff!

07:47.008 --> 07:49.135
[Laughing, Hooting]

07:49.219 --> 07:50.719
[Growling]

07:50.804 --> 07:53.973
- This is what men-
- Yee-hoo!

07:54.057 --> 07:55.975
Aah-aah-aah!

07:56.059 --> 07:59.103
You're probably getting D.E.N.N.I.S.
'd right now by that new boyfriend of yours,

07:59.187 --> 08:00.771
and you don't even know it.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.816
What boyfriend? She don't have a boyfriend!
Yes, I do! Ben.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.027
You know, the online soldier that I met.
We're back together now.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.989
What? That dude wouldn't date you
after what you put him through!

08:10.115 --> 08:13.117
Maybe he'd D.E.N.N.I.S. you, but he wouldn't date you.
He's not D.E.N.N.I.S.-ing me!

08:13.201 --> 08:15.703
He's in the car right now.
I told him to wait for me.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.460
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

08:23.545 --> 08:27.214
So, wait. Your guy has been waiting out
here the whole time in the hot sun?

08:27.299 --> 08:30.759
Yeah. I told him to wait for me.
He kinda does whatever I say. It's pretty great.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.304
Why'd you tell him to do it with the windows up?
That's cruel. The engine's not even on.

08:34.389 --> 08:38.142
I didn't. I just didn't tell him to do it with
the windows down. He's not the smartest, but...

08:38.226 --> 08:40.144
Dee, it's, like,
100 degrees outside.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.479
I'm assuming that he has
engaged you physically?

08:42.563 --> 08:45.149
Well, I mean, of course
we've engaged physically.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.151
Look at that body.
It is stupid.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.653
Of course we've engaged
over and over physically.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.990
But that doesn't mean that he's
pulling some sort of a system.

08:53.074 --> 08:58.370
Hey, guys! Hey- Hey, Dee!
I didn't see you there. Are you almost done?

08:58.455 --> 09:01.498
Yeah. Yeah. I got caught up in a story.
But I'll be done pretty soon.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.959
O-O-Okay. Well, do you
want me to come in?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.378
No. No, I don't. No.
You just- You just stay where you are.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.339
You know what? I'll text you
when I'm wrapping up.

09:08.465 --> 09:11.342
Then you can crank the A.C.
, cool the car off for me. Okay. Sure thing.

09:11.468 --> 09:14.678
See you, fellas. Okay.
Good. See you, man.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.431
Dee, you're getting played.
You're getting played big time.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.183
He's not doing anything.
Big time!

09:19.267 --> 09:21.227
He's just- I told him to sit...

09:21.311 --> 09:23.062
[Sighs]

09:27.651 --> 09:31.695
And there you go. Good to see you.
See you soon. Bye.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.490
- Hey, Caylee.
- What do you want?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.492
Listen,
before you say anything,

09:36.576 --> 09:40.704
I just want to say that I'm really sorry
for everything that went down between us.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.373
It's all my fault.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.959
Nana took a turn for the worse,

09:45.043 --> 09:50.547
[Voice Cracking] and it's got
me in a really bad place.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.549
I just...

09:52.634 --> 09:55.469
I don't know what I
would do if she died.

09:57.013 --> 10:01.016
I don't think your
grandmother exists, Dennis.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.105
I beg your pardon?

10:06.189 --> 10:11.735
Uh, yeah. I looked into it. There's no, um, Dr.
Toboggan in Philadelphia either.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.697
Oh. No- Yeah, he doesn't-
He's not based in Philly.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.573
Oh, no?
Yeah.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.785
No, it says Philadelphia right there.
Oh. Yeah- No, that...

10:19.869 --> 10:24.290
I'm gonna call him because if he's still
giving people prescriptions on that pad,

10:24.374 --> 10:27.376
those people could get
in a lot of trouble.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.845
Oh! Whoa!
What the hell are you doing here?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.264
I'm swooping in on your chick.
What? No.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.933
Dude, I'm trying to re-D.E.N.N.I.S.
This chick so I can shove it in Dee's face.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.476
What is this
"swooping in" business?

10:44.561 --> 10:47.980
Oh, that's my system. The M.A.C.
"Move-in After Completion."

10:48.064 --> 10:49.523
I wait till you're done
with them.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.568
Then I swoop in, give them shoulder
to cry on, and then we hump.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.988
You been humping these girls after
I'm done with them? Oh, yeah, dude.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.657
I come in as the sensitive,
intellectual type.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.702
Why do you think I'm always reading books
and shit when we do the spider routine?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.246
I thought you were just my
wing man though. No. No.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.582
I'm swimming in your wake.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.834
- What are you two dickheads doing here?
- What are you doing here?

11:08.918 --> 11:12.588
- I'm here for the scraps. - I haven't had a
chance to get in there yet, okay? So just...

11:12.672 --> 11:14.131
What's taking you so long?

11:14.215 --> 11:17.343
Wait, wait, wait! You have a system
where you come in after Mac?

11:17.427 --> 11:20.888
That's right. I come in after Mac.
But he's taking forever this time.

11:20.972 --> 11:25.684
I got my magnum condoms.
I got my wad of hundreds. I'm ready to plow.

11:25.769 --> 11:29.146
You should see him feast.
He's like a mantis. It's amazing.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.358
Oh, that's good.
Call me that from now on.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.151
Mantis.
No!

11:34.235 --> 11:36.779
Nobody's calling you Man-
Look, you guys gotta back off, okay?

11:36.905 --> 11:39.239
I'm trying to re-D.E.N.N.I.S.
This chick. No, you back off!

11:39.324 --> 11:42.034
Wait a second, Frank. He's right.
It's a delicate ecosystem.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.495
We gotta stick with it.
Just let him do his thing.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.663
Then we'll come in for seconds
and scraps. Back off.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.832
Get out.
Just play it cool.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.876
Before she sees you.
Hurry up, though, because...

11:50.960 --> 11:53.379
Magnum condoms and a wad of hundreds.
Idiot.

11:54.464 --> 11:58.425
This is so exciting.
You're gonna love this.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.761
Okay, just stop
right there. Okay.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.931
And off with the-
Okay, here we are!

12:04.015 --> 12:06.558
I set up a picnic for us!
[Laughs]

12:06.643 --> 12:08.560
What the hell are you doing?

12:08.645 --> 12:12.064
What- I- I set up a picnic.
Do you not like picnics?

12:12.148 --> 12:16.068
Okay. All right. I know what's going on.
I- I'm on to you, guy.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.071
You bring me out here to some
landfill in the middle of nowhere,

12:19.155 --> 12:21.698
you blindfold me
so I have no idea where I am...

12:21.783 --> 12:23.700
I'm gonna depend on you
to get home!

12:23.827 --> 12:26.703
Dee, do you want to go? Yeah. Oh, yeah.
I wanna go, but not with you!

12:26.830 --> 12:29.289
I'll go all by myself.
I'll take the bus. Okay.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.834
And I'll also take this. Thank you.
Here. Do you want a glass?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.419
No! Stop it!
Do you need bus fare?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.629
I don't need bus fare!
I'm not sure the bus comes out here anyway.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.882
- I'll walk then, okay?
- Wh- In your heels? They're very nice.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.885
- Here, take my boots. - Stop it!
Stop trying to make me depend on you, okay?

12:41.970 --> 12:44.596
I'm fine all by myself, buddy!
I'm doing just fine by myself.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.682
[Screaming]

12:49.060 --> 12:50.769
[Groaning]

12:50.854 --> 12:53.272
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

12:53.356 --> 12:55.441
[Gasping] I'm fine!

12:55.525 --> 12:58.402
Well, just stay there.
I'm gonna come down to help.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.238
Leave me alone!
I won't give you the satisfaction!

13:01.322 --> 13:02.906
I'm fine!

13:02.991 --> 13:06.618
- I'm independent, and I
don't need you! - Wait!

13:06.703 --> 13:08.954
I don't need anybody!

13:09.080 --> 13:10.914
[Grunting Continues]
Where are you going?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.666
Shut up!

[Rattling]

13:20.967 --> 13:23.093
Oh, what the hell!

13:23.178 --> 13:26.346
- Oh, what the hell, Charlie!
- Oh, hey! Look who's home!

13:26.473 --> 13:29.224
Uh- Hang on a second. What you doing there?
I'm calling the police.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.227
Oh, no! You don't have to call the police.
Check it out.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.313
I'm here just to
fix your garbage disposal.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.231
Is that a bag of hair
in your hand, Charlie?

13:36.316 --> 13:39.151
Have you been breaking into my
apartment and shoving hair in my sink?

13:39.235 --> 13:43.071
Okay. Okay! Let's start over.
We're getting way of topic here.

13:43.156 --> 13:47.784
I would like you to focus on the amount of
value that I am demonstrating to you...

13:47.869 --> 13:50.120
by fixing
your garbage disposal.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.830
Just get the hell
out of my apartment.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.832
Are you sure? 'Cause your garbage
disposal's a mess. Pretty sure.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.126
It's way worse than when I got here.
I think you should get out.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.545
All right. I like this blouse you're wearing.
That's nice. Is that new?

13:58.630 --> 13:59.838
What is that?
It's modern, right?

13:59.923 --> 14:02.883
This is my uniform that I have to
wear for my other job, and it's ugly.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.969
Well, no, it's not ugly.
It's just, you know- It's unique.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.306
So what's this new job?
I work at the fair.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.059
You're working at the fair!
Well, look at us, you know?

14:12.143 --> 14:15.521
I'm a plumber. You're a fair worker.
They go well together, right?

14:15.647 --> 14:19.024
Get out of my apartment.
Oh, all right.

14:21.027 --> 14:25.989
I don't know. I did everything right, and
I can't get past the letter "D," dude.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.201
- Well, what did you do exactly?
- I broke into her place.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.995
I ripped her sink apart.
I brought a bag of hair. You know what I mean?

14:32.121 --> 14:34.831
And I come across looking like a total jerk.
Yeah, of course.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.833
Because nothing that you just
described sounds correct.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.211
These are totally the type of things you
were talking about- slashing a girl's tires,

14:39.295 --> 14:40.754
doing scary voices.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.799
- Do you know anything about plumbing?
- Uh... no.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.177
Maybe it's just over my head, this system.
Maybe I should just stick to stalking.

14:47.303 --> 14:51.473
Maybe that's my system. She got a job at the fair.
It could be fun to stalk around a fair.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.561
Jesus Christ on the cross,
you look like shit.

14:55.687 --> 14:59.398
Yeah! That's 'cause I spent the night in the
woods trying to demonstrate my independence!

14:59.482 --> 15:02.818
Okay, clearly none of you have
any idea how to run my system!

15:02.902 --> 15:05.529
Goddamn- All right. I'm gonna get everybody
what they want, including myself.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.531
Let me just think for a second.

15:07.615 --> 15:11.326
Let me just work something
out here and then... we'll...

15:11.452 --> 15:15.038
## [Orchestra: Carmen]
[Dee] What's he doing?

15:15.123 --> 15:17.291
Just shut up and let him work.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.302
## [Stops]

15:30.680 --> 15:32.222
We're going to the fair.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.932
Mmm!
[Charlie Laughs]

15:34.017 --> 15:36.727
That will provide the perfect setting
for all of our needs to be met.

15:36.811 --> 15:40.105
You will demonstrate your value to the
waitress by winning a prize at her booth.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.108
Good, dude! Then I give her
the prize and that's good!

15:43.192 --> 15:44.860
No, that's dead wrong actually.

15:44.986 --> 15:48.155
You're gonna take the prize and award it
to the bustiest woman you can find. Okay?

15:48.239 --> 15:51.450
Your indifference to the waitress will
only make you more attractive to her.

15:51.534 --> 15:56.330
Now, Dee, because of your ridiculous
missteps, you actually have no value.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.124
Mm-hmm. So your only hope
is to lower Ben's value.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.127
You're gonna do this by flirting
with a carney in front of him.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.755
Oh, gosh, yeah, I don't know if
I want to deal with a carney.

16:04.839 --> 16:08.425
No one likes dealing with carneys, and
that's why Frank will pose as one.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.094
Now, Mac, you're
the final piece in this puzzle.

16:11.179 --> 16:16.350
I need you to resume your role as the thoughtful
roommate and invite Caylee out to the fair.

16:16.434 --> 16:19.728
There I shall be waiting
to win back her heart.

16:19.812 --> 16:24.483
- How you gonna do that?
- I gotta get myself a grandmother.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.035
What's happening?

16:35.119 --> 16:37.537
What's happening is,
we're at the fair, Gladys,

16:37.622 --> 16:39.665
and you're gonna act
like my grandma, okay?

16:39.749 --> 16:43.960
My grandmother had an affair
with Susan B. Anthony.

16:44.045 --> 16:47.089
I-I don't give a shit.
I'm paying you not to talk.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.300
Well, hello!
This is a coincidence, huh?

16:50.426 --> 16:53.595
No, it's not. No, it's not.
But it's exciting, isn't it?

16:53.680 --> 16:56.682
So, what game do we have here?
What game is this?

16:58.935 --> 17:01.520
Speed Pitch. That's all you do?
You throw a pitch?

17:01.604 --> 17:03.230
I mean, what prizes are there?

17:03.314 --> 17:05.190
There are no prizes, Charlie.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.567
It's just to see "how
fast can you throw." Oh!

17:07.652 --> 17:12.155
Then I guess I'll demonstrate my value to you
by firing off a wicked hot fastball, huh?

17:12.281 --> 17:15.200
[Chuckles] You know this
game is for children, right?

17:15.284 --> 17:18.912
I don't care that it's for kids. All right?
Let me demonstrate my value to you. Please!

17:18.996 --> 17:22.082
When I was little, all the kids would
beat me up and call me Bookworm.

17:22.165 --> 17:24.960
- Right this way, Nana.
- Kids are so brutal.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.462
Oh. Hi, Mac, Caylee.
I didn't see you there.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.965
- What are you doing here?
- This is my nana.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.467
She's on the mend, so I wanted
to get her out of the house.

17:32.552 --> 17:37.139
- This is your grandmother? - Oh, yeah. Yeah.
This is Nana. Yeah. Isn’t she precious?

17:37.223 --> 17:40.600
My grandmother was a lesbian.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.607
Well?
How does it look?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.901
It's great.
You look like a lizard.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.695
I like turtles.
Okay.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.656
Ooh, look! A carney!

17:54.782 --> 17:57.409
## [Humming] Ooh! Eh. Frank!
Hey, Frank! What are you doing?

17:57.535 --> 18:00.704
Lose the tie. You're way overdressed.
I got a new angle.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.956
What? [Caylee] No, Dennis,
this does not change...

18:03.082 --> 18:05.709
Leave us alone. What? What?
Just listen to me for one second, okay?

18:05.793 --> 18:08.712
Dennis, I've been looking all over for you.
Where you been?

18:08.796 --> 18:11.715
Hello. Dr. Toboggan.
Nice to meet you. Hi.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.675
Frank, what are you doing?

18:13.760 --> 18:17.721
Actually, it's Mantis.
Mantis Toboggan, M.D.

18:17.805 --> 18:21.558
I got your test results.
You're positive. You got the H.I.V.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.560
Yes, AIDS. Big time!
What the hell you talking about?

18:23.686 --> 18:25.020
Dennis, what- You got
the AIDS big time!

18:25.146 --> 18:28.148
What are you doing, dude?
Did you see her face? Look at her.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.401
I'm breaking her down.
I'm making her feel worthless. You see?

18:31.486 --> 18:34.112
She thinks she's got the H.
I.V. Then I slip in.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.741
- ## [Whistles] Get it?
- There is an order here, dude! Get back in line!

18:37.825 --> 18:40.410
No! No more thirds for Frankie!
Seconds from now on!

18:40.536 --> 18:42.871

It's 'cause I'm getting tired.
My arm's blown out.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.921
Hey, Speed Pitch. You want to play?
[Growls] Okay.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.256
Oh! Hey, wait, wait. Hey, guy.
Do you work here?

18:53.382 --> 18:56.843
Yeah. Yeah! Oh, shit.
Ben, look. A carney.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.678
Hey.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.558

Ow, you stabbed me!
He stabbed me with a key!

19:09.690 --> 19:11.483
Will someone- someone
call a doctor! Ow!

19:11.567 --> 19:14.486
You idiot! Why would you stab me?
I was flirting with you!

19:14.570 --> 19:16.196
That guy paid me to.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.074
You weren't supposed to stab her, man!
You were supposed to stab her!

19:19.158 --> 19:21.284
What?
You want to have me stabbed?

19:21.369 --> 19:23.662
I was gonna protect you
from the stabbing.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.372
Wrong! Wrong!

19:25.456 --> 19:27.040
Wrong! Wrong!

19:27.124 --> 19:30.043
You're supposed to let her get stabbed,
hope that it hits a main artery,

19:30.127 --> 19:32.671
and then as she's dying
you nurse her back to health,

19:32.797 --> 19:35.173
thereby making her totally
dependent on you! Ohh!

19:35.258 --> 19:38.260
See, this is why nobody
should be going off my system!

19:38.344 --> 19:40.262
What do you mean,
"Off your system?"

19:40.346 --> 19:42.681
My system of seduction
that I used to win your heart,

19:42.765 --> 19:44.683
that these idiots
are ruining right now!

19:44.767 --> 19:46.685
Ben's the only one
who's using it properly.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.813
- Ben, explain the system.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.900
You had your face painted like a goddamn frog
person and you have no ulterior motive here?

19:53.985 --> 19:56.361
- I'm a lizard.
- Oh, whoops! Oh!

19:56.445 --> 20:02.367
I dropped my monster condom
that I use for my magnum dong.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.327
I'm out of here.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.329
I'll give you a ride!
Thank you.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.331
What? What are you doing?
I'm leaving.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.333
Dee, I don't like you.
Well, how is that possible?

20:10.459 --> 20:12.377
You're a mean person.
[Stammers]

20:12.461 --> 20:14.504
You know what?
You go! You get outta here!

20:14.630 --> 20:17.173
Way to go, jerks! Good job!
Yeah? Way to go to you.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.343
You work at a fair, carney!
Don't call her a carney, man.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.178
I don't need you to take up for me!
Get out of here!

20:22.305 --> 20:24.931
Shut up! Just go! Get outta here!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.809
Idiots ruining my system.
Everybody ruins my system! Nobody gets it!

20:27.935 --> 20:29.853
Oh, system, my ass.
I hate carnivals.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.855
I need a ride.

20:31.939 --> 20:35.567
Is there anybody out there
that could take me home?
