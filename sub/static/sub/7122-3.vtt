00:43.168 --> 00:46.012
Babla-babla babla-babla-baloo!

00:46.088 --> 00:48.136
Stunts!

00:49.508 --> 00:51.351
Hyah!

00:59.184 --> 01:00.686
Yeah!

01:00.769 --> 01:02.521
Yo, Finn! Look what I found!

01:02.604 --> 01:04.402
A vertical trampoline!

01:07.401 --> 01:08.323
It's sticky.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.779
Dude, it's a spider web.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.113
Ohhh.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.493
Well, cut me out, yo!

01:12.573 --> 01:13.699
No way.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.284
I'll stunt you out!

01:15.367 --> 01:17.119
Whaaah!

01:17.202 --> 01:19.250
I was thinking something
else would happen.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.581
You got anything sharp?

01:20.664 --> 01:23.042
The only sharp thing I
<i>had</i> were my fingernails,

01:23.125 --> 01:24.672
but you made me cut them.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.799
They were too long, Finn.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.802
Aaaaah!

01:29.881 --> 01:31.258
You broke the skin, dude!

01:31.341 --> 01:34.561
I guess my fingernails are
really lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ng!

01:34.636 --> 01:37.606
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

01:37.681 --> 01:38.773
Oh, yeah.

01:38.849 --> 01:39.849
Sorry.

01:39.891 --> 01:40.983
It's cool, man.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.561
Can you stretch us out of here'?

01:42.644 --> 01:43.736
Humph!

01:43.812 --> 01:45.029
Hmphhhhh!

01:45.105 --> 01:46.402
Humphhh!

01:46.481 --> 01:47.481
Aghh!

01:52.654 --> 01:55.248
I'm gonna take a nap while you
grow out your fingernails.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.418
We'll make our escape
when I wake up.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.876
You'll never escape!

02:01.955 --> 02:04.424
We will all die in the web!

02:04.499 --> 02:06.422
That's the circle of life.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.501
That's not a circle.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.512
That's, like... a straight line.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.716
We don't make the rules, man.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.175
Well, don't just give up.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.445
And you're walking too fast.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.391
You know I can't...

02:16.470 --> 02:17.722
The spiders are back!

02:17.804 --> 02:19.056
Try to stay calm.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.562
Greet your fate with dignity.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.987
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

02:25.062 --> 02:26.063
We got to go, Jake!

02:27.689 --> 02:28.986
Jake!

02:29.066 --> 02:30.209
So, what? You're not
talking to me now?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.655
No.

02:31.735 --> 02:36.161
I'm just tired from setting
traps all day solo style.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.616
Why are you mad?

02:37.699 --> 02:39.747
I just said I was tired.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.419
But you're <i>acting</i>
like you're mad.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.621
I'm not mad!

02:42.704 --> 02:44.877
Oh, look... food...

02:44.956 --> 02:46.208
that I caught.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.339
In my web.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.544
For us.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.348
I spin webs, too, Ed.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.595
Yeah, I know.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.848
I try just as hard as you.

02:56.927 --> 02:57.974
Hmm?

02:58.053 --> 02:59.270
Well, go ahead, then.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.065
Wrap them up for laters.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.483
What's wrong, Barb?

03:03.558 --> 03:04.730
What's going on there, Jake?

03:06.269 --> 03:07.896
I can't!

03:07.979 --> 03:10.232
You think I'm gross
when I spin my web!

03:10.315 --> 03:11.487
What?!

03:11.566 --> 03:12.783
I could see it on your face!

03:12.859 --> 03:13.906
Tell me that you don't!

03:13.985 --> 03:15.202
Uh...

03:15.278 --> 03:18.908
I... uh... um...

03:18.990 --> 03:21.960
You tell me you don't
find me gross!

03:22.035 --> 03:23.958
Oh, get stuffed, Ed!

03:26.289 --> 03:27.962
Barb!

03:30.544 --> 03:31.670
You guys are sad.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.642
Ugh! What is that sound?

03:37.718 --> 03:40.597
Sick, dude! She makes
that sound, too?

03:40.679 --> 03:44.934
Yeah, I guess, but she never
does it in front of me.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.855
Anyway, it's not gross
when guys do it.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.406
Dude, that's not cool.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.709
You need to think
about what you say

03:52.733 --> 03:54.076
and how that affects your lady.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.824
How about how <i>she</i> affects <i>me?</i>

03:55.902 --> 03:57.245
I love her, man.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.327
Hmm... huh?

04:00.407 --> 04:01.533
Humph!

04:02.534 --> 04:03.410
Oh, snap.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.415
How long was I out?

04:04.494 --> 04:06.212
Can someone tell
me why we fight...

04:06.288 --> 04:09.838
Why she treats me like all
I do is make her feel bad?

04:09.916 --> 04:11.839
Tell me, Glob.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.216
Why don't you ever answer me?!

04:14.296 --> 04:17.175
It's hard to step outside of
yourself when you're enmeshed

04:17.257 --> 04:19.055
with another being.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.980
Oh, Grod! It's over! It's over!

04:23.054 --> 04:24.054
Aaaaaaaah!

04:24.097 --> 04:24.939
Wait!

04:25.015 --> 04:26.015
What?

04:26.933 --> 04:27.934
Ummmmm...

04:29.853 --> 04:32.356
Right now, we got to real-talk
about your girlfriend.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.658
I don't real-talk with my food.

04:34.733 --> 04:35.905
Uh...

04:37.944 --> 04:39.672
We real-talk now, or
you're gonna be as single

04:39.696 --> 04:41.414
as your stinky web squirter!

04:41.490 --> 04:42.787
Yeah, right.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.618
You just want to
get out of my web.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.204
All you food ever
want to do is escape.

04:47.287 --> 04:51.417
Y'all is always like in cahoots,
making plans not to be food.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.797
I'm not in cahoots.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.173
So, okay.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.925
Eat your friend here.

04:57.506 --> 04:58.506
Okay.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.425
No, Finn! What?! Where
is your heart?!

05:00.509 --> 05:01.351
Look inside yourself!

05:01.426 --> 05:02.348
This isn't you!

05:02.427 --> 05:03.895
I'm gonna fake-eat you, man.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.347
Oh. Word.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.524
N-o-o-o-o-o-o!

05:09.100 --> 05:09.976
Oh, my guts!

05:10.060 --> 05:11.778
My guts everywhere!

05:11.853 --> 05:13.480
Ohhhh! How could you?!

05:13.563 --> 05:14.655
Aaaaah!

05:14.731 --> 05:16.028
Okay, man.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.654
You've earned my trust.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.031
So let's do this.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.703
Real-talk me, Bro.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.031
Okay, first off, then,

05:22.113 --> 05:24.207
how you're going about
this isn't working.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.374
Am I right?

05:26.618 --> 05:27.790
Yeah.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.587
It's not working.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.131
My way sucks.

05:31.206 --> 05:34.005
Cool. Now we got to
do damage control...

05:34.084 --> 05:35.961
Healing the negs
energy at the source.

05:36.044 --> 05:39.469
Yes, heal the negsergies in me.

05:39.548 --> 05:40.891
All right, uh...

05:46.263 --> 05:47.560
Go find Barb a present.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.061
That'll fix the first neg.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.642
Can you do that?

05:50.725 --> 05:53.399
Yeah, I can find her a present,
if you think that'll help.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.151
I don't think it will.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.948
But what do l know?

05:57.023 --> 05:59.367
I'm just a big ol' dummy
who does everything wrong.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.944
Ptoo!

06:01.027 --> 06:01.869
Wheeeeee!

06:01.945 --> 06:03.868
You're free-e-e-e-e!

06:03.947 --> 06:04.823
Ugh!

06:04.906 --> 06:05.702
Oh, man!

06:05.782 --> 06:06.783
It's okay, Finn.

06:06.867 --> 06:07.993
You bought us some time.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.202
Yeah. Think fast.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.663
What can we use?

06:13.748 --> 06:14.670
There's nothing.

06:14.749 --> 06:15.966
Just a bunch of nature.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.544
I have a dumb idea.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.715
Get her a present.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.550
Hmph.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.806
When was the last time
she got <i>me</i> a present?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.763
What would she want, anyways?

06:27.846 --> 06:29.814
How do <i>I</i> know? We never talk.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.984
Geez, what happened to my life?

06:32.058 --> 06:33.605
All my friends are gone.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.312
They all got kids now.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.772
<i>I</i> don't have kids.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.698
All I have is Barb.

06:38.773 --> 06:42.994
And she treats me
like a-a dingus!

06:45.572 --> 06:46.572
Oh! Cool!

06:46.615 --> 06:47.912
A sword!

06:48.992 --> 06:50.369
Wow! Neat!

06:50.452 --> 06:52.204
It's magic or something!

06:52.287 --> 06:55.791
We can hang this up over our
mantel and snuggle by the fire

06:55.874 --> 06:59.754
like we... like we used to!

06:59.836 --> 07:02.055
I'm gonna fix us, Barb!

07:02.130 --> 07:03.973
Fix us!

07:04.049 --> 07:06.051
All right, one...

07:06.134 --> 07:07.010
two...

07:07.093 --> 07:08.093
three!

07:08.970 --> 07:09.766
Yo! What?

07:09.846 --> 07:10.847
Shoot!

07:10.931 --> 07:12.274
Here comes another one.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.726
One, two, three!

07:15.060 --> 07:16.060
My eyes!

07:16.102 --> 07:17.729
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

07:17.812 --> 07:20.235
Ha ha! Yes! Finally!

07:22.233 --> 07:23.359
Good job!

07:23.443 --> 07:25.366
Last chance for life. Break out!

07:26.696 --> 07:27.696
Yeah, you mommy!

07:28.823 --> 07:31.246
Hey! What's going on here'?

07:31.326 --> 07:32.168
Nothing.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.039
Aah!

07:33.119 --> 07:34.166
Oh!

07:34.245 --> 07:36.168
Crabapples!

07:36.247 --> 07:37.499
Where's Ed?

07:37.582 --> 07:40.256
Oh. Uh, he's getting you
an "I'm sorry“ gift.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.804
He feels crazy about
making you cry.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.098
He does'? Really?

07:45.173 --> 07:46.891
Barb! Barb!

07:46.967 --> 07:48.184
Ed?

07:48.259 --> 07:50.637
Barb! Look! Damage control!

07:50.720 --> 07:51.721
Check it out!

07:51.805 --> 07:53.227
I wrapped it up and everything!

07:53.306 --> 07:55.650
Oh, Ed, I can't believe it!

07:55.725 --> 07:57.318
Yeah! Come on! Open it!

07:57.394 --> 07:58.816
I-I really just...

07:58.895 --> 08:01.318
I-It's just so unlike you to...

08:04.025 --> 08:04.947
What's this?

08:05.026 --> 08:06.118
It's a sword.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.320
I found it in the woods.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.496
In the woods?!

08:08.571 --> 08:09.914
Yeah. It's magical, though.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.162
Check out the blade!

08:11.241 --> 08:12.743
You got this for you, Ed.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.421
No, I got it for us... For
snuggles by the fire!

08:16.496 --> 08:18.214
We are never gonna snuggles

08:18.289 --> 08:20.383
until you learn
to appreciate me!

08:20.458 --> 08:21.835
Oh, really?

08:21.918 --> 08:24.091
Well, I guess we're never
gonna eat again, either,

08:24.170 --> 08:28.300
<i>'cause I</i> catch the food and
your butt is dysfunctional!

08:28.383 --> 08:30.306
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

08:30.385 --> 08:31.307
Yaaaaah!

08:31.386 --> 08:32.854
Go! Run away, food!

08:32.929 --> 08:34.647
We don't need you, apparently!

08:34.722 --> 08:37.067
Just break up, you guys!

08:37.142 --> 08:38.894
Do it for you!

08:38.977 --> 08:40.820
Now what are you gonna eat?

08:40.895 --> 08:42.272
Huh, Barb?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.357
I'm gonna eat <i>you!</i>

08:44.441 --> 08:46.443
Yo! That's wrong!

08:46.526 --> 08:49.575
Who ca-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-res?!

08:50.697 --> 08:52.540
Aaah!

08:52.615 --> 08:54.208
Aaaaaaaah!

08:54.284 --> 08:55.581
We're free!

08:56.661 --> 08:57.662
Aaaaaaaaaah!

08:57.746 --> 08:59.589
Eeee! Ohhhh! Aaaah!

08:59.664 --> 09:00.756
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

09:00.832 --> 09:03.585
No! No! No! Aah!

09:03.668 --> 09:04.760
Oh, no.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.713
You got that look on your face.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.264
You going back to
help that fool?

09:08.339 --> 09:09.591
His wife's gonna eat him!

09:09.674 --> 09:11.722
Spider marriage is complicated.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.270
