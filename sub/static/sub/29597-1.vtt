01:24.626 --> 01:26.208
- Hi there.
- Hello.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.093
Espresso.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.456
We've just got
the regular type of coffee here.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.131
Uh, two, please.

02:02.581 --> 02:03.581
Ugh.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.587
Okay.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.630
Bonjour.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.998
<i>You have completed
lesson 25. Well done.</i>

02:55.258 --> 02:58.592
<i>At this point, you should have
a firm grasp of the French language.</i>

02:58.762 --> 02:59.843
<i>Let's continue.</i>

03:21.326 --> 03:22.929
I wish I would have
been able to see that.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.320
Grant is
without a doubt

03:25.330 --> 03:27.697
the worst boss
on the face of the Earth.

03:27.791 --> 03:31.080
One of these days, I'm going to
punch him in the goddamn throat.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.581
I can promise you that.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.087
- Are you talking about Grant?
- We are.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.837
I was thinking we should pull
an office prank on Grant, you know.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.717
Put, like, an air horn
under his chair,

03:40.721 --> 03:42.838
so when he sits down,
it makes a really loud noise.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.090
Or set fire to his house.
Something along those lines.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.842
I think Maggie
gave birth recently.

03:49.855 --> 03:53.644
Grant's wife, Maggie.
Actually, I... I know she did.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.837
I went to the cookout
at his house last weekend

03:55.861 --> 03:58.901
and they were there with their new baby,
along with their two other children.

03:59.781 --> 04:04.242
It was actually a really nice cookout.
Quality meats and sides.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.795
There was even a raffle for a gift card
to that new restaurant in town.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.332
Most of the office was there.
Some of them even wore their swimsuits.

04:11.668 --> 04:17.834
So, maybe burning down
the house isn't the best...

04:21.470 --> 04:23.678
But, yeah...
Yeah, sometimes...

04:23.680 --> 04:26.388
Sometimes here at the office,
Grant will give me an assignment,

04:26.433 --> 04:30.143
such as auditing an expense report,
and even though it's part of my job,

04:30.145 --> 04:32.637
reports and auditing,
it can be frustrating.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.342
What's that magazine
you're reading?

04:38.612 --> 04:41.229
- What department are you in?
- Accounting.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.444
So you're the one who audits
our expense reports?

04:45.035 --> 04:46.116
Yeah.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.111
Get the fuck
out of here.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.822
I'm sorry.
I didn't know we were out.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.305
Do you have a gun?

07:21.316 --> 07:22.352
What?

08:08.029 --> 08:09.236
No, no, no, no.
Please don't.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.107
Oh, here, here.
You can take my wallet.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.903
There's $10 plus a gift card
to the new restaurant in town.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.626
Why are you doing this?

08:40.477 --> 08:42.811
<i>There was yet
another mugging last night,</i>

08:42.813 --> 08:45.227
<i>this one putting
a 35-year old dog owner</i>

08:45.233 --> 08:46.565
<i>in critical condition.</i>

08:46.943 --> 08:49.230
<i>The motorcycle-riding
assailants are still at large.</i>

08:49.237 --> 08:51.274
Daddy,
there's a doggy in here.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.197
<i>In an official statement,
police are urging residents</i>

08:54.200 --> 08:56.237
<i>to stay indoors after dark,</i>

08:56.244 --> 08:59.578
<i>adding that if you must go outside,
you should carry a weapon,</i>

08:59.706 --> 09:01.823
<i>such as a gun
or a large knife.</i>

09:02.167 --> 09:05.080
<i>You have
only one unheard message.</i>

09:05.128 --> 09:09.919
<i>Hey, Casey. Uh, this is Grant.
Your boss. From work.</i>

09:09.966 --> 09:12.583
<i>Just calling to check in on you,
see how you're doing.</i>

09:12.802 --> 09:14.864
<i>I just want you to know,
you can take all the time you need.</i>

09:14.888 --> 09:16.925
<i>We can keep you on paid leave
for another week</i>

09:17.265 --> 09:19.705
<i>and then it'll just start counting
towards your vacation time.</i>

09:19.934 --> 09:23.223
<i>Uh, but you've got so much of that
built up, so I wouldn't be concerned.</i>

09:24.022 --> 09:27.102
<i>Hey, um, maybe you could take that trip
to France you're always talking about.</i>

09:27.400 --> 09:30.046
<i>I hear the people there are lovely
and the food is supposed to be...</i>

09:31.154 --> 09:33.146
<i>No one else
left you a message.</i>

10:37.011 --> 10:39.719
I'm sorry.
I can't go out there.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.100
<i>This isn't how it was
supposed to be.</i>

11:03.121 --> 11:05.955
<i>I was supposed to win.
You didn't play by the rules.</i>

11:07.458 --> 11:08.869
<i>There never were any rules.</i>

11:39.866 --> 11:40.947
Can I help you?

11:40.950 --> 11:43.442
- I'm interested in buying a gun.
- Are you a hunter?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.952
No. It would be
for self-defense.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.635
I need something
that can fit into my hand.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.324
Sounds like
you're after a handgun.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.624
How about
something like this?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.347
Yes. This is exactly
what I'm looking for.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.334
I can hold it in my hand
quite easily.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.650
I'll run the background check
and file the necessary paperwork.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.483
Yeah. Is there some sort of
box you can put this in, or a bag?

12:23.826 --> 12:27.991
Sorry. There's a waiting period before
you can legally purchase this gun.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.994
- Oh.
- It's so a person who is upset with another person

12:31.000 --> 12:33.413
can't come in here and buy a gun
to shoot that person with.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.895
Instead, they have to wait a little
while before they can do that.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.416
- Do you have any children?
- No, I don't. Just a dog.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.630
Good. If you did
have children,

12:42.679 --> 12:45.763
I would warn you that the risk of
accidental death increases drastically

12:45.765 --> 12:47.660
with a gun in the home,
but since you don't have any children,

12:47.684 --> 12:49.346
that statistic
is irrelevant to you.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.687
You did mention self-defense though.
Be cautious.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.851
In a violent altercation, an armed victim is
much more likely to be shot and killed

12:57.860 --> 12:59.021
than an unarmed victim.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.904
Suicide is more common
with gun owners too.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.615
You're really gonna
love owning a gun.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.153
I'm sure you're right.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.250
Karate is a language.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.504
It's a way of communicating.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.083
When you were a child,

14:04.635 --> 14:07.878
you trained your vocal chords
to manipulate air to make words.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.220
And then you learned
how to combine those words together

14:12.226 --> 14:13.933
so that they would
form sentences.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.888
And those sentences expressed thoughts,
wants, needs...

14:19.108 --> 14:22.977
Every conversation that you had
was honing your skills.

14:25.156 --> 14:28.320
And now,
after all these years,

14:30.453 --> 14:33.321
you are black belts
in speech.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.291
So, at this point
in your karate training,

14:38.127 --> 14:44.169
you are learning how to form words
with your fists and with your feet.

14:45.343 --> 14:48.263
You're gonna get to the point
where you don't even have to think about it.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.346
Ask me a question.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.612
What... What are your
plans for the weekend?

14:56.562 --> 15:00.772
I'm going to do some grocery shopping
and rent a film.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.359
Perhaps a comedy to watch

15:05.196 --> 15:08.030
in the comfort of my own

15:09.742 --> 15:10.778
home.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.417
Did that
answer your question?

15:30.680 --> 15:32.842
That's it for today.
Bow to me.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.722
Bow to Grand Master.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.434
I hope it's...

15:48.364 --> 15:49.821
I hope it's all right
that I watched.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.617
The hardest part of your karate journey is
walking through that door

15:54.620 --> 15:56.782
for the first time.
That's where most people fail.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.037
- What was your name?
- Casey. Casey.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.086
My name is Sensei.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.293
Can anyone take classes?

16:07.633 --> 16:12.378
The first lesson is free, so why don't you
come in tomorrow and give it a shot?

16:14.182 --> 16:15.182
I'll try.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.526
Higher, Manny.
You must attain the proper angle.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.229
Remember, you're punching
his nose up into his brain.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.064
The key word is "up."

16:33.493 --> 16:34.609
Okay, class, line up.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.905
We're gonna work
on a rear naked strangle.

16:41.292 --> 16:44.205
With karate, our goal is always
to end a fight with strikes.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.973
Snapping an opponent's arm with a karate chop,
that would be one way.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.377
Or shattering their jaw
with a perfectly placed

16:49.383 --> 16:50.823
spinning wheel kick
would be another.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.044
But realistically,
when engaged in combat,

16:54.055 --> 16:56.763
it is not a matter of if a fight
will end up on the ground.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.473
It's a matter of when.

16:58.809 --> 16:59.845
Manny.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.678
This is called
"taking the back."

17:05.942 --> 17:07.558
I am in
the dominant position.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.522
He is a mouse.
I am a python.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.857
I slide my arm around his neck,
my elbow under his chin.

17:15.952 --> 17:20.571
Like a python, I slowly begin to
squeeze my mouse.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.750
My arm cuts off the carotid arteries
on either side of his neck,

17:25.002 --> 17:27.041
starving the brain of oxygenated blood.

17:31.008 --> 17:34.297
Students, what is
rule number eight?

17:34.595 --> 17:37.258
Tap or take a nap.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.928
Tap or take a nap.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.685
Okay, let's give
this technique a try.

17:53.698 --> 17:54.814
Bow to me.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.032
Bow to Grand Master.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.538
Hi there.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.500
You're an excellent teacher.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.697
Usually, it's the mothers
that bring the children, not the fathers.

18:16.721 --> 18:17.757
Which one's yours?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.593
Oh, I'm not a parent.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.217
I'm actually a new student.
I'm taking my first class today.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.810
- You're a new white belt?
- Is that the first belt color?

18:25.980 --> 18:28.393
White is before color.
You haven't earned color yet.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.766
That makes sense, actually.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.692
I think I need to borrow
a uniform for class.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.311
I was going to ask Sensei
but I didn't see him...

18:34.322 --> 18:35.984
And you're lucky
he doesn't see you.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.275
You're lucky he doesn't
see some white belt

18:39.327 --> 18:41.819
disrespecting his dojo
and everything he's built.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.490
What is the first rule?

18:44.206 --> 18:45.822
The board is behind you.
What's rule number one?

18:45.833 --> 18:46.914
Oh.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.916
No shoes on the mat.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.174
Take off your
fucking shoes, white belt.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.737
You need a gi and you need a belt.
Is that what you're asking?

19:18.115 --> 19:19.196
Yes.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.053
- But say I'm at an ATM...
- Mmm.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.411
...and as my back is turned,
a man grabs my throat from behind.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.947
- Okay. May I?
- Of course.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.208
In this instance,

19:30.252 --> 19:33.666
the first thing you always have to do
is alleviate the pressure on your neck.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.921
Mmm-hmm.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.584
Your center of gravity
needs to be lower than mine,

19:38.594 --> 19:39.835
so drop your hips.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.757
- Like this?
- Exactly.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.968
Now you can lift me
off my feet with ease.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.637
Good.

19:47.436 --> 19:51.146
See, even though I have your back,
you are now in the dominant position.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.807
I have no control
and I can easily be thrown.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.479
- This is very effective.
- Yes, it is.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.607
- What if they're resisting more?
- Show me.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.373
I see what you mean.
I would probably, uh...

20:14.880 --> 20:16.246
I'd probably do
something like that.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.130
There's a lot of testosterone
in this dojo.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.682
That's a hormone
men produce.

20:29.437 --> 20:32.225
Women produce it too
but men produce much more.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.232
Is this your first class?

20:37.695 --> 20:41.359
- It is.
- Here, let me help with that.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.278
You gotta start from the front,
not the back.

20:59.592 --> 21:00.708
Mmm.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.305
I notice
that your belt is blue.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.893
It is. Um, I feel a connection
to the color blue.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.435
- It suits me.
- Is blue a high rank?

21:15.524 --> 21:17.015
Blue is one of
the middle colors.

21:17.526 --> 21:21.361
The order is white, yellow, green,
blue, purple, brown, black.

21:21.781 --> 21:25.900
Some schools use different colors
or change the order of the colors,

21:25.910 --> 21:29.244
but our academy does it this way
and it's definitely the best way.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.956
- And what do the strips of tape mean?
- They're called "stripes."

21:32.958 --> 21:34.039
Stripes.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.251
Stripes signify advancements
and achievements.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.459
What does
the red stripe mean?

21:39.590 --> 21:42.298
It means the person has killed
another person in combat.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.007
I'm joking.
It's for instructors.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.926
Anna, the brown belt,
has a red stripe

21:48.933 --> 21:50.515
and she teaches
the children's class.

21:50.935 --> 21:53.348
The only two people here
with red stripes are her and Sensei.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.770
And what about
the black stripe?

21:56.106 --> 21:59.349
Sensei only gives those to select students.
Green belt and up.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.926
Today's your first day though.
I wouldn't worry about stripes.

22:08.619 --> 22:14.206
It is wise to respect the past
but foolish to ignore innovation.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.162
Grand Master understood this.

22:17.878 --> 22:18.959
He would say,

22:19.129 --> 22:22.497
"The only moves worth learning
are the ones that work."

22:23.801 --> 22:26.293
Just 'cause I'm a karateka
doesn't mean that I wouldn't teach

22:26.345 --> 22:28.177
a bow and arrow choke
from Brazilian jiujitsu,

22:28.180 --> 22:30.968
or an inside heel hook
from Russian sambo.

22:31.559 --> 22:35.052
I would teach a reverse wrist splicer
from Mongolian judo if it worked

22:35.062 --> 22:36.769
and if it wasn't something
I just made up.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.722
Rule number 10.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.318
If it works, use it.

22:44.488 --> 22:47.572
Which brings me
to today's lesson.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.034
To kick with your fists,

22:52.162 --> 22:53.824
and punch with your feet.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.866
- I'm Kennith. What's your name?
- Casey.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.078
I'm glad
you chose karate, Casey.

23:02.673 --> 23:05.336
It's an excellent martial art
and will likely change your life.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.593
- Would you like to go first?
- Maybe you should go first.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.761
Okay.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.597
- Not in the day class.
- Sorry, Sensei.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.416
I forgot where I was.
It was an accident.

23:25.571 --> 23:26.687
You all right?

23:32.578 --> 23:33.989
I'm really glad
you're here.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.449
That punch
got away from me.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.244
I apologize.
Would you like to try?

23:48.469 --> 23:50.426
Okay, uh, that was
a good first try.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.963
That felt a little more like
a kick than a punch though.

23:53.349 --> 23:54.760
It felt like
a kick to me too.

23:55.476 --> 23:58.093
Your whole life, you've known
that a foot can only kick.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.011
You've known
that a foot cannot punch.

24:01.398 --> 24:02.638
Forget everything
that you know.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.402
Much better.
That felt like a punch.

24:12.576 --> 24:13.908
A very weak punch,

24:13.911 --> 24:16.951
but the most important thing is that
you're learning to punch with your foot.

24:17.539 --> 24:18.825
Let me show you again.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.666
Don't think of it as me punching
your body with my foot.

24:25.965 --> 24:29.584
Think of it as you striking
my foot with your body.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.090
That makes perfect sense.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.310
Wow.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.929
You have a wonderful
sense of balance.

24:43.941 --> 24:45.557
I wanna sign up
for classes.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.022
That's excellent news.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.245
I'm gonna go ahead
and enter you into the system.

25:08.799 --> 25:11.758
- Name? Casey...
- Davies.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.174
That's a very
feminine-sounding name.

25:21.645 --> 25:25.434
- Age?
- I turn 36 next month.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.960
Do you know what that is in months?
The system does it in months.

25:38.328 --> 25:41.662
Four hundred
and thirty-two minus one

25:42.624 --> 25:47.619
is 431 months old.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.584
Oh.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.628
That sounds old
when you put it that way.

25:56.847 --> 25:57.883
Why karate?

25:59.641 --> 26:00.677
Um...

26:00.684 --> 26:02.220
This question is
multiple-choice.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.345
"A, health and fitness.
B, career opportunity.

26:05.355 --> 26:09.816
"C, New Year's resolution.
D, self-defense/traumatic experience."

26:11.278 --> 26:12.485
What if
it's none of the above?

26:14.740 --> 26:17.198
- Should I read the choices again?
- No, that's okay.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.900
A, health and fitness.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.761
This is the equipment room.

26:39.139 --> 26:42.098
- This room is off limits. You understand?
- Okay.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.596
Wait here, please.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.502
This is your belt.

27:12.548 --> 27:16.963
Do not come to class without your belt.
It is yours. It is sacred.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.095
There'll be a $15 charge
to replace a lost belt.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.155
- Hello?
<i>- Hi.</i>

27:43.162 --> 27:45.199
<i>May I speak to
Ms. Casey Davies, please?</i>

27:45.205 --> 27:47.037
This is him.
I'm a man.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.449
<i>My mistake. I thought it was
a woman's name.</i>

27:49.710 --> 27:53.704
- Who is this?
<i>- I'm calling about yourgun, the handgun.</i>

27:53.714 --> 27:57.048
<i>Wait. I remember you now.
Yes, you are a man. Again, apologies.</i>

27:57.050 --> 27:58.211
That's all right.

27:58.260 --> 28:01.549
<i>It looks like your paperwork is gonna
go through without any complications.</i>

28:01.555 --> 28:03.922
<i>Tomorrow morning, you will be able
to come in and purchase your gun.</i>

28:06.185 --> 28:08.893
<i>- Are you still there?</i>
- I don't need a gun anymore.

28:09.271 --> 28:10.887
<i>You're not having a child,
are you?</i>

28:10.939 --> 28:13.852
<i>Because we sell child safety locks
that work reasonably well.</i>

28:13.901 --> 28:15.312
No. No child. I just...

28:16.904 --> 28:18.020
I found something else.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.444
<i>Don't tell me you bought a knife.
Knives are good for self-defense too,</i>

28:21.450 --> 28:23.533
<i>but nine times out of 10,
a person with a knife</i>

28:23.535 --> 28:26.243
<i>who gets into a fight with a person
with a gun will lose.</i>

28:26.246 --> 28:27.282
I didn't buy a knife.

28:27.289 --> 28:30.327
<i>Well, the paperwork is valid
for the next six months.</i>

28:30.500 --> 28:33.288
<i>In the meantime, I hope you don't
get attacked by anyone with a gun,</i>

28:33.670 --> 28:35.411
<i>- or even a knife.</i>
- Goodbye.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.491
<i>Good luck...</i>

28:52.189 --> 28:53.305
Next. Go.

28:59.863 --> 29:00.899
Next. Go.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.153
Go.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.528
Horrible.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.744
You do that in a fight
and your opponent would laugh at you.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.291
Next. Casey.

29:19.549 --> 29:20.585
Good.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.008
Very good.

30:06.221 --> 30:11.433
<i>Hey, Casey. Uh, it's Grant,
your boss. From... From work.</i>

30:11.810 --> 30:14.848
<i>So, it's been two months
since you've been in to the office.</i>

30:15.314 --> 30:16.475
<i>How are you?</i>

30:17.024 --> 30:20.643
<i>I've extended your leave five weeks past
what I'd originally planned,</i>

30:20.694 --> 30:25.155
<i>and your paycheck last week, you know,
that actually came out of my own pocket,</i>

30:25.198 --> 30:28.066
<i>but I consider you a friend.
Uh</i>...

30:28.118 --> 30:31.907
<i>Look, I hate to be the bad guy here
but I'm going to need you to come in.</i>

30:31.955 --> 30:35.744
<i>I can give you another day but you have
to come back to work after that.</i>

30:35.792 --> 30:38.284
<i>Or</i>... <i>You know,
I'm going to have to let you go,</i>

30:38.337 --> 30:40.704
<i>and I really don't want
to have to do that.</i>

30:41.381 --> 30:45.375
<i>Look, if it were up to me, I'd give you
all the time you need, but my bosses...</i>

30:45.469 --> 30:48.962
<i>The inbox is full.
Please clear your messages.</i>

30:59.316 --> 31:00.852
Who are all
these new people?

31:02.486 --> 31:04.068
Today's the promotion
ceremony.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.903
Everyone comes
to the promotion ceremony.

31:07.741 --> 31:10.700
- Even students who take the night class.
- The night class?

31:11.036 --> 31:12.743
Black stripes.

31:13.455 --> 31:17.039
The color black represents
night. As in "night class."

31:17.709 --> 31:19.371
I think I'll stick
with the day class.

31:20.837 --> 31:24.672
Now that I think about it,
you're much more suited to the day class.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.841
Me, on the other hand...

31:29.054 --> 31:30.761
I'm getting
my stripe today.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.930
Overheard Sensei
talking about it.

31:33.141 --> 31:36.009
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

31:36.436 --> 31:39.224
I have...
I have definitely earned it.

31:56.456 --> 31:57.992
Today's a special day.

31:59.209 --> 32:02.418
Not only is it a day
in which we recognize those of you

32:02.421 --> 32:03.878
who have outgrown
your belt color,

32:04.881 --> 32:07.419
it is also
an important anniversary.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.092
Seven years ago today,

32:10.095 --> 32:12.929
Grand Master was killed
in a tragic hiking accident

32:12.931 --> 32:14.672
where he was shot
in the face with a gun.

32:16.351 --> 32:20.311
He was mistaken for a bird
by a hunter carrying a shotgun.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.848
Type of gun
that fires a cartridge

32:22.858 --> 32:25.726
which scatters 10 to 20 pellets
at its target.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.270
Unlike our karate,
which is clean and precise,

32:29.281 --> 32:31.523
this gun was imprecise
and boorish.

32:32.534 --> 32:33.820
Rule number 11.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.653
Guns are for the weak.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.530
That board isn't
just for children.

32:40.167 --> 32:41.658
The rules apply
to all of us.

32:58.059 --> 33:03.179
Grand Master is the only person ever
to wear the rainbow belt.

33:04.524 --> 33:08.814
It's a belt color that he created
and awarded to himself.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.155
It is the highest honor
in all of karate.

33:13.533 --> 33:16.196
He achieved this rank
after he challenged and defeated

33:16.203 --> 33:19.492
all three other grand masters in the state
in unarmed combat to the death.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.709
He finished each fight
with his signature technique.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.870
A technique
only he knew.

33:28.089 --> 33:29.876
A technique he never
even taught me.

33:33.261 --> 33:36.254
He punched through his opponents' heads
with his index finger.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.475
He was the greatest man
who ever lived.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.107
I do not award belts.

33:49.528 --> 33:50.894
My students earn them.

33:52.906 --> 33:55.649
And this first belt
goes to someone

33:56.910 --> 33:58.321
who I see
a little of myself in.

33:59.996 --> 34:02.613
He has devoted
himself to karate,

34:03.166 --> 34:06.534
and he has more than earned the right
to wear the color yellow.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.130
Casey.

34:55.802 --> 34:59.045
The progression from
yellow belt to green belt

34:59.055 --> 35:02.389
is one of great sacrifice
and introspection.

35:02.601 --> 35:06.595
It is filled with immeasurable pain,
both internal and external.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.494
Thank you all for coming
to support each other.

35:24.164 --> 35:26.497
- We are all family here...
- Isn't there something else?

35:27.751 --> 35:28.787
What was that?

35:29.836 --> 35:32.749
I just wanted to make sure you weren't
forgetting something.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.362
What would I
be forgetting, blue belt?

35:35.925 --> 35:38.884
Uh, I heard there was going to be
another promotion tonight.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.713
- You heard that?
- I did.

35:44.059 --> 35:45.675
Something black.

35:48.730 --> 35:49.811
Oh.

35:50.690 --> 35:51.931
"Something black."

35:54.027 --> 35:57.270
Actually, you're correct.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.236
There is something black.

36:04.954 --> 36:08.823
Well, I was saving it till the very end
for dramatic effect.

36:28.228 --> 36:30.515
As I said before,
today is a special day.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.104
Not only because it is
the unfortunate anniversary

36:35.110 --> 36:37.477
of Grand Master being shot
and killed while on a hike

36:37.529 --> 36:39.646
after being mistaken
for a bird by a hunter.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.815
Today is the first time

36:43.284 --> 36:45.776
that I get to promote one of
my students to black belt.

36:46.371 --> 36:49.079
This student has been with us
from the very beginning.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.165
They are unquestioning.

36:52.001 --> 36:53.867
Their loyalty is unwavering.

36:55.004 --> 36:58.168
But most importantly, they know
that despite this black belt,

37:00.468 --> 37:01.925
they will always
be my student,

37:03.304 --> 37:05.011
while I will always
be their teacher.

37:11.813 --> 37:12.894
Thomas.

37:31.416 --> 37:32.907
You're in my spot,
brown belt.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.919
Black is higher than brown.
Please move over to your left.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.577
This concludes
the ceremony.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.684
As always, be sure to hold on
to your old belts

37:51.728 --> 37:54.345
so that if someone questions
the legitimacy of your rank,

37:54.397 --> 37:56.684
you can prove them wrong first
with tangible evidence,

37:56.691 --> 37:58.023
and then in combat.

38:11.873 --> 38:14.832
- Missionary.
- Ah, that is the best position.

38:14.918 --> 38:17.661
I also like when I'm behind her
and she's on her hands and knees...

38:17.670 --> 38:20.003
- Doggy style.
- Yes, doggy style.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.838
That position
is also very nice.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.950
All this stuff's yellow.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.419
Paper, please.

39:55.435 --> 39:58.849
Excuse me
Did you door-ding my car?

40:00.106 --> 40:02.223
- I don't know.
- I think you did.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.599
Then why
did you ask me?

40:03.818 --> 40:06.105
Because I wanted to give you the
benefit of the doubt.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.569
- Okay, then no.
- No what?

40:07.864 --> 40:09.605
- I don't think I did.
- But you did though.

40:10.658 --> 40:13.150
- I say I didn't.
- But it doesn't work that way.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.823
You obviously did. I saw you.
You can't just tell me...

40:14.829 --> 40:16.786
- Do you have a problem?
- The part where you slammed your door

40:16.789 --> 40:18.549
into my car, I have a problem
with that. Yes.

40:21.669 --> 40:24.002
- I know karate.
- What belt are you?

40:24.339 --> 40:25.580
Yellow belt.

40:26.215 --> 40:27.877
Your arms are holding
the grocery bag.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.588
You'd have to drop the bag
in order to strike me.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.156
In the time it would
take you to do that,

40:32.180 --> 40:34.020
I would punch you
in the face as hard as I can.

40:34.390 --> 40:37.098
So I'm gonna ask you again.
Do you have a problem?

40:42.523 --> 40:45.607
You didn't slam
your door into my car,

40:47.278 --> 40:50.646
- so I don't have a problem.
- No.

40:55.286 --> 40:59.075
You? Karate?
Impossible.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.303
No. Bad dog.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.524
I'm sorry.

41:50.091 --> 41:52.083
Fuck.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.343
Are you sure this board
isn't meant for green belts?

41:55.847 --> 41:57.088
Here, let me try.

41:57.974 --> 41:59.090
Okay.

42:03.438 --> 42:05.100
Here, try a white
belt board.

42:25.668 --> 42:28.035
Your kicks and punches
lacked conviction today.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.746
Maybe I was wrong.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.271
Maybe you weren't ready
to be a yellow belt.

42:43.436 --> 42:48.431
No. You're not supposed to do that.
You're supposed to stand up for yourself.

42:48.649 --> 42:52.233
But you're right though. I wasn't able
to break a single board today.

42:53.321 --> 42:55.608
And that stops you from
being a yellow belt how?

42:57.158 --> 43:00.697
If a bear's forest catches on fire,
the bear is still a bear.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.496
Even if a boat capsizes
in rough seas

43:04.540 --> 43:05.809
and sinks
to the bottom of the ocean

43:05.833 --> 43:06.949
with no survivors,

43:07.001 --> 43:08.117
it is still a boat.

43:09.462 --> 43:12.079
You will be a yellow belt
until you die,

43:14.926 --> 43:16.633
or until you're a green belt.

43:18.054 --> 43:20.421
And you'll be a green belt
until you're a blue belt.

43:21.766 --> 43:22.802
And so on.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.723
I wish I could
wear my belt all the time.

43:28.731 --> 43:30.643
I feel less-than
without it.

43:35.196 --> 43:36.437
Come with me.

43:42.370 --> 43:43.952
I want you to tell me
why you're here.

43:45.248 --> 43:48.332
I... I told you before.
It was my New Year's resolution.

43:48.793 --> 43:50.750
I thought you said
it was health and fitness.

43:52.213 --> 43:53.374
That's what I meant.

43:54.841 --> 43:56.252
Why are you really here?

44:05.309 --> 44:06.425
I was mugged.

44:08.104 --> 44:09.766
At night.
A few months ago.

44:11.440 --> 44:15.559
I was beaten, severely,
by several men.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.029
I'm afraid.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.611
I'm afraid of the dark.

44:24.203 --> 44:25.694
I'm afraid of other men.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.076
They intimidate me.

44:31.335 --> 44:33.577
I wanna be
what intimidates me.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.793
Well, you came to the right place.
You're learning karate.

44:41.846 --> 44:43.963
You're a blade
and I'm sharpening you.

44:45.892 --> 44:48.009
But there's a mental
component as well.

44:48.936 --> 44:51.895
You mean, like,
believing in myself?

44:53.858 --> 44:55.440
Yeah. That won't hurt.

44:56.569 --> 44:58.561
I'm talking about
something a little different.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.814
What's your favorite
style of music?

45:03.701 --> 45:04.908
Adult contemporary.

45:05.578 --> 45:07.535
No. Should be metal.

45:10.249 --> 45:13.367
- Do you ever listen to metal?
- You mean, like hard rock?

45:14.545 --> 45:17.754
Metal is much more
aggressive than hard rock.

45:18.591 --> 45:20.708
- From now on, you'll listen to metal.
- Yeah.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.463
It's the toughest music
there is.

45:23.429 --> 45:24.795
What about hobbies?

45:25.223 --> 45:29.843
Is there anything that you feel
particularly passionate about,

45:30.728 --> 45:32.765
other than your new-found
passion for metal?

45:34.106 --> 45:35.313
I enjoy France.

45:36.442 --> 45:40.277
I mean, French things.
I haven't actually been to France,

45:40.321 --> 45:44.486
but I'm learning the language
and I would like to visit there someday.

45:44.617 --> 45:46.404
Mmm, that's not good.

45:46.452 --> 45:48.444
Historically, the perception
of the French

45:48.496 --> 45:50.536
is that they're weak and
that they surrender easily.

45:51.332 --> 45:52.914
Hardly traits that
you want to embrace.

45:53.125 --> 45:56.459
Russia, on the other hand,
is considered a tough country.

45:57.338 --> 46:00.672
Also, Germany.
Germany is very strong and capable.

46:00.716 --> 46:04.209
- My dog's breed is German.
- Excellent. German shepherd.

46:04.553 --> 46:06.010
A dachshund, actually.

46:07.014 --> 46:09.757
- Well, regardless, Germany it is.
- Okay.

46:10.226 --> 46:12.934
You must start thinking this way.
Do you understand?

46:13.229 --> 46:16.973
In every facet of life. What you eat.
How you interact with others.

46:17.483 --> 46:20.851
What arouses you. Everything should be
as masculine as possible.

46:27.076 --> 46:31.036
As you know,
I teach a night class.

46:32.581 --> 46:35.745
This is your invitation.

46:38.129 --> 46:40.667
I've never opened this class up
to yellow belts before

46:40.715 --> 46:42.422
but I'm gonna make
an exception for you.

46:43.175 --> 46:46.418
- What time is the class?
- It's at night. It's a night class.

46:46.679 --> 46:47.679
I don't think I can.

46:48.806 --> 46:52.891
I won't make you do anything,
but like the color of the belt,

46:53.644 --> 46:55.226
you've earned this stripe.

46:55.688 --> 46:58.681
This invitation,
it will be yours forever.

47:00.109 --> 47:03.068
Just because you ignore it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

47:04.905 --> 47:05.941
Come here.

47:14.957 --> 47:19.201
Not only does this class offer you more
of what I believe you're looking for

47:19.253 --> 47:23.918
but I guarantee you it will help you
become what you fear.

47:26.344 --> 47:29.758
Casey, stop being afraid.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.835
The usual? Chocolate croissant
and an orange juice?

48:23.859 --> 48:29.025
No. I've got a new usual.
Coffee. Hot. Black. With nothing to eat.

48:32.701 --> 48:35.614
- That's mine.
- It's mine now. I take what I want.

48:35.663 --> 48:37.279
I only care about myself.

48:53.139 --> 48:54.139
Hey there, Casey.

48:57.685 --> 49:00.223
- Listening to music?
- I'm learning German.

49:00.688 --> 49:03.522
German? That's very
international of you.

49:04.150 --> 49:06.358
You may want to start
on those reports though.

49:06.777 --> 49:09.565
That pile is getting awfully high
and I don't want you to feel obligated

49:09.572 --> 49:11.438
to come in to the office
over the weekend.

49:12.658 --> 49:15.241
Hey, um, Maggie asked me if you wanted
to come over for dinner.

49:15.244 --> 49:16.360
What do you say?

49:19.498 --> 49:20.705
Stop trying to be my friend.

49:20.749 --> 49:22.866
Bosses cannot be friends.
It doesn't work that way.

49:22.877 --> 49:24.493
Instead of coming over
to your house for dinner

49:24.503 --> 49:25.869
with you and your wife
this weekend,

49:25.880 --> 49:27.837
I think I'll stay home and masturbate
to the thought of your wife

49:27.840 --> 49:29.440
wearing her bathing suit
at the barbecue.

49:33.429 --> 49:36.342
- We should do push-ups.
- Hey. Shut up. Stop talking.

49:36.515 --> 49:39.258
- What did you say?
- You talk too much. I don't talk, I act.

49:39.268 --> 49:41.510
I punched him in the goddamn throat.
It felt amazing.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.603
- Who?
- Our boss, Grant.

49:48.277 --> 49:50.314
Do you want to join us?

49:50.988 --> 49:53.196
But there's just
the three chairs.

49:53.199 --> 49:54.360
I'll sit in your chair.

50:06.253 --> 50:07.334
Ah.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.371
We should do push-ups.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.760
You're a good dog
and I care for you.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.517
That said, I won't be
petting you anymore.

50:27.149 --> 50:30.859
I've been coddling you.
This is for your own good.

51:50.441 --> 51:51.522
Sorry.

51:54.653 --> 51:55.734
What are you doing?

51:56.697 --> 51:59.137
You're not supposed to be here.
You don't have a black stripe.

51:59.700 --> 52:00.986
I thought
you were my friend.

52:02.828 --> 52:05.366
A friend wouldn't say
they were a day class student

52:05.372 --> 52:07.284
and then go to the night class
behind my back.

52:07.333 --> 52:08.493
I didn't...

52:24.975 --> 52:27.638
Our limbs get their strength
from leverage points.

52:28.937 --> 52:30.519
An elbow can
only bend one way

52:30.522 --> 52:32.962
because if it could bend more than
one way it would be weaker.

52:33.442 --> 52:35.855
But this design is also
inherently flawed.

52:36.487 --> 52:39.487
Henry, come on up to the front.
I want you to help me demonstrate something.

52:49.750 --> 52:50.786
Watch closely.

53:04.598 --> 53:08.182
Leverage is a weapon. You can use it
or it can be used against you.

53:10.562 --> 53:13.555
You earned your blue belt.
I know I could never take that from you.

53:15.150 --> 53:16.607
So I took your arm instead.

53:18.904 --> 53:22.397
Never come back here.
Not even for the day class.

53:27.996 --> 53:32.787
Everyone, I'd like you
to welcome Casey to the night class.

53:33.335 --> 53:34.621
He's a yellow belt.

53:35.838 --> 53:38.046
All right. Let's begin.

56:02.776 --> 56:04.142
You're done
for the night.

56:06.697 --> 56:07.733
So is he.

56:14.204 --> 56:17.493
Can you drag him
off the mat?

56:27.551 --> 56:29.258
Learn to love
this feeling.

56:30.470 --> 56:34.555
Your bones aching.
Your chest screaming.

56:35.767 --> 56:37.178
This is karate.

56:39.605 --> 56:41.597
I have nothing else.

56:42.524 --> 56:47.690
Congratulations on a great class, everyone.
Let's begin the cool-down.

57:19.561 --> 57:21.473
They're all gonna
cool down on the mat,

57:21.521 --> 57:22.582
but since
it's your first time,

57:22.606 --> 57:24.366
I want you to cool down
away from the others.

57:25.525 --> 57:26.525
Come with me.

57:45.253 --> 57:47.773
I know you're probably a little confused
about what's happening.

57:48.507 --> 57:50.590
Just know that every one
of them out there

57:50.634 --> 57:52.250
had to do this
at one point.

58:01.144 --> 58:04.228
Again, I'm sorry
to make you cool down with her.

58:04.815 --> 58:07.933
She's a woman so her hands are naturally
weaker than a man's.

58:08.193 --> 58:11.061
An after-workout sports massage works
best with strong hands,

58:11.113 --> 58:12.775
so I know
this is not ideal.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.903
A massage from a woman
is still better than a self-massage.

58:22.624 --> 58:24.832
Well, what are you
waiting for, yellow belt?

58:30.757 --> 58:32.589
Take off your jacket
and sit in front of me.

58:50.819 --> 58:51.935
Sorry.

58:52.779 --> 58:54.611
I know they're not
as strong as a man's.

58:59.995 --> 59:02.157
So, this is the women's
changing room.

59:02.956 --> 59:04.037
It is.

59:04.916 --> 59:08.125
It's the same as the men's in every way,
only it's smaller and not as nice.

59:10.714 --> 59:12.626
How long have you
been taking karate?

59:12.758 --> 59:15.000
I was one of the dojo's first students
when it opened.

59:16.261 --> 59:17.797
And how long
have you been a brown belt?

59:17.804 --> 59:20.012
The cool-down
is supposed to be silent.

59:27.064 --> 59:29.272
Why was he promoted
to black belt before you?

59:30.984 --> 59:32.566
Is that why
you fought him tonight?

59:34.362 --> 59:35.728
You could have killed him.

59:36.490 --> 59:38.982
- It looked like you wanted to.
- I was proving a point.

59:39.242 --> 59:40.608
- About your belt?
- No.

59:41.536 --> 59:42.777
About why I'm here.

59:44.915 --> 59:46.201
Never hold back.

59:47.375 --> 59:48.582
Not ever.

59:49.544 --> 59:52.457
It will only make you weak,
and you can't be weak anymore.

59:52.464 --> 59:53.830
Not in the night classes.

59:56.259 --> 59:57.340
Do you understand?

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.504
I think I do.

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.715
But then again,
maybe I don't.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:09.641
You will.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.358
This isn't
a safe place, Casey.

01:00:29.668 --> 01:00:30.749
My turn.

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:37.377
You can come in.

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:48.684
Your belt. It's yellow.

01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:50.229
I had it made.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:52.934
It's for everyday use
with casual clothing.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:56.192
Obviously, I chose yellow
because I am a yellow belt.

01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:58.106
I wanted to wear
my yellow belt all the time

01:00:58.113 --> 01:00:59.695
but I knew
it would look strange.

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:02.819
That really is
a wonderful idea.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:05.701
To be honest,
I wish I'd thought of it.

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:07.744
Now I can be a yellow belt
in everyday life,

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.238
in addition to being one
in this dojo.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:13.037
I mentioned before
that I had it made.

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:15.002
It was a special order.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:17.789
The thing is, the belt company
wouldn't make just one.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.419
I had to make
at least 50.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:28.220
The positive out of this is that
I have enough for all the other students.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.352
I even had them make
a black one for you.

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:34.475
I think it turned out
quite nice.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:04.343
I don't know what to say.

01:02:06.014 --> 01:02:07.175
I'm honored.

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:09.682
How much
did all this cost?

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:12.597
Oh, don't worry about that.
This is my gift to the academy.

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:15.722
Although I was let go from my accounting job
the other day, unexpectedly.

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:17.310
You have
accounting experience?

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:20.898
Oh, 10 years,
or 120 months.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.905
I'm looking for someone
to help manage the books here.

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:26.790
I can't keep up
with the growth of the academy.

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:28.863
There's more money coming in.
It's overwhelming.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:31.578
I could use a mind
like yours.

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:34.824
It wouldn't be permanent.
Just till you get things on track.

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:38.415
Well, thank you.
Yes. The answer is yes.

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:40.750
Good.

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:42.922
You'll start tomorrow.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:46.965
I'm sure you'll find another job
by the time you finish

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:48.429
organizing the books here.

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:50.510
- Casey.
- Yes?

01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:53.391
I really am excited
about the belt.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.322
- Hello?
<i>- Casey?</i>

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:11.406
Who is this?

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:14.451
<i>The men you told me about,
would you know them if you saw them?</i>

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:16.950
Is that you, Sensei?

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:19.331
<i>The men.
The ones who attacked you.</i>

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:21.830
- I...
<i>- Would you know their faces?</i>

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:26.459
They were wearing helmets.
Motorcycle helmets.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:29.716
<i>- So you didn't see their faces?</i>
- Why are you asking me this?

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:31.259
<i>The other day,
when you told me about</i>

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:32.382
<i>what happened to you,</i>

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:33.803
<i>it made me angry.</i>

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:35.635
<i>I have resources.</i>

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:38.433
<i>I found one of the men
who attacked you, Casey.</i>

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:40.139
<i>I need you to meet me.</i>

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:42.558
<i>But I won't be sure.</i>

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:44.480
<i>It was dark.</i>

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:47.605
<i>And like I was saying,
they were wearing motorcycle helmets.</i>

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:51.610
<i>It's him.
You have to trust me.</i>

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.736
<i>You trust me, don't you?</i>

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:02.203
Did you park in the garage
like I asked?

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.296
Yeah.
There was a motorcycle.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:06.836
I'm glad you came.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:11.149
I see you're wearing
your belt for strength.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:12.929
Me too.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:16.717
Not only does it represent
my black belt in karate

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:18.594
but it also helps
keep my pants up.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:21.021
Yeah. So, where is he?

01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:25.271
In the bar.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.148
I still don't... Are you...
Are you sure it's him?

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:31.657
- Very sure.
- But how?

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:34.531
How what? You saw the motorcycle
with your own eyes.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:35.820
How did you find him?

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:39.366
- You don't need to worry about that.
- Well, what does he look like?

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:44.788
He wears a hat sometimes,
but not always.

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:51.339
There he is.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:54.092
- That's the man we're looking for.
- Him?

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.217
Yeah. He matches
the description I gave you.

01:04:57.519 --> 01:05:00.119
He's not wearing a hat, but I told you
he doesn't always wear one.

01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:02.472
I just don't think we should do this.
Not like this.

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.043
Although I do appreciate
you trying to...

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:07.768
I'm not giving you
the choice, Casey.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.062
Out here's no different
than in my dojo.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:12.315
That belt that you're wearing
is still yellow and mine's still black.

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:14.929
I'm your teacher and you're my student
and you'll do as you're told.

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:19.539
And understand this. I'm not helping you.
You're helping yourself.

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.166
Remember what he did to you.

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:27.501
He stole your dignity.

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:30.833
Take it back.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:21.140
Hi.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:23.977
Do you remember me?

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:26.055
I don't think.

01:06:27.108 --> 01:06:28.315
Hey!
Look at me.

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:30.275
I'm talking to you.

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:33.271
Do you remember my face?

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.405
Good night.

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:56.631
No. Don't touch him.

01:06:58.056 --> 01:06:59.672
Don't touch him.
He's still breathing.

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:01.432
What are you doing?

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:03.679
You taught him a lesson.

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:08.101
He and his friends will definitely
think twice before messing with you again.

01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:11.396
- Why are you filming this?
- I'm documenting.

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:13.819
Documenting what?

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:15.900
Your growth.

01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:23.283
See you tomorrow.

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:26.143
We'll get you started with determining
which accounts are delinquent

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:28.375
and then, if we have enough time,
we'll move on to organizing the receipts

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:30.165
for the business-related
purchases.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.878
You did the right thing.
You'll see.

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:42.028
I'm sorry.
There was nothing we could do.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:46.741
Did he go peacefully?

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:49.915
No. It was likely
very painful.

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:51.917
There was a great deal
of trauma.

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.002
What do you mean, "trauma"?

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:57.163
Well, the X-rays indicated
there were broken ribs

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:59.377
and severe bruising
to the internal tissue.

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:01.292
I don't understand.

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:04.633
Did you hurt your dog?

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.136
Of course not. No.
He was my best friend.

01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:09.301
I left him alone in my house
and when I came back...

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.913
Did you notice anything
out of place?

01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:13.395
I... I don't know.
I came straight here.

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:15.023
Do you think
someone did this to him?

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:18.810
- We found blood on his canines.
- He bit them?

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:22.486
It seems he fought to the very end.
He was very brave.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:24.946
I tried my best
not to coddle him.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:29.951
I know this is hard.
I don't want to upset you.

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:34.993
But it's the strangest thing.
He died from a punch. I'm sure of it.

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:41.296
Only, the bruising pattern doesn't seem
to indicate a fist but rather a foot.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:45.004
I know. It doesn't
make any sense.

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:52.845
Sometimes your opponent
will be bigger than you,

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:56.144
but remember this. You're children.
You're still growing.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:59.810
If they defeat you in combat, there will
always be the opportunity later in life,

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:02.313
when you are fully grown,
to exact your revenge.

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:04.637
Casey, we're in
the middle of a class.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.372
What are you doing?

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:16.372
I'm wearing shoes
on the mat.

01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:18.707
Also, I didn't bow.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.501
What happened?

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.880
- What is it? You can tell me.
- I'm hungry.

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:34.306
Don't do this.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:38.524
All this not bowing and eating
on the mat has made me thirsty.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:48.609
Rule number nine. Stay hydrated.

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:51.286
- Enough.
- You killed my dog!

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:56.450
- When?
- Last night.

01:10:58.838 --> 01:11:00.295
I was with you
last night.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.124
Casey, that's impossible.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.071
Is that the dog that you were telling me
was of German lineage?

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.007
He was a dachshund,
you son of a bitch.

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:12.759
Dachshund. Short of stature, long of body.
Not the most masculine of breeds.

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:15.928
No, unfortunately, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:11:17.023 --> 01:11:18.230
My condolences.

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:25.938
Fuck you
and fuck your dojo.

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:28.361
As I said already,
I was with you last night.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:30.947
I saw what you did to that man,
that innocent man.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:32.364
You said
he was one of them.

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:34.906
And deep down, you knew
he didn't have anything to do

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:37.516
with whatever happened to you
and yet you did what you did anyway.

01:11:38.085 --> 01:11:40.498
- You're insane.
- It didn't matter to you, did it?

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.290
You wanted to take out your pain
and frustration on someone else

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.916
and you needed to become
what you hated.

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:48.635
I'm done.
This isn't karate.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.216
I have it all
on tape.

01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:18.619
The man from last night
has two choices.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.710
Either become a better version of himself...

01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:23.248
...or succumb
to his weaknesses.

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:27.758
You gave him that choice,
and his life will never be the same.

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:30.761
That night all those months ago
was the best thing

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.755
that ever happened to you
and you know it.

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:37.180
You are who you always
wanted to be.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.807
Karate has changed you.

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:45.605
Channel this energy
into class tonight.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:12:59.949
And take your shoes off.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:11.168
Okay, children.
Back to work.

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:24.356
In the art of accounting,
I'm a white belt,

01:13:25.943 --> 01:13:28.811
and you are
a fiscal black belt.

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.658
- Did you kill my dog?
- No.

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:38.366
Even if it wasn't a masculine dog,
I didn't kill it.

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:40.576
But I'm gonna
make this right.

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:42.456
You'll see.

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:46.419
I've been having trouble
controlling my emotions lately.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:47.503
I'm sorry.

01:13:56.557 --> 01:13:59.595
It's a very masculine trait.
Embrace it.

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:03.554
Women are
much cooler-headed.

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:07.023
I want you to come
work for me full-time.

01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:10.276
This is
a part-time job at best.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.271
I want you to take over
the children's class.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:14.652
- What about Anna?
- Let me worry about Anna.

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:18.156
But she's easily the most qualified person
for this position.

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:20.122
I'm just a yellow belt.
She's almost a black belt.

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:22.038
Anna will never
be a black belt.

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:27.036
To be honest, I didn't ever think
she'd last this long.

01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:31.339
When she earned her blue belt,
I put her in charge of the children's class

01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:33.834
due to her innate maternal instincts.
She is a woman.

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:36.929
But she let her feminine tendencies
interfere with her karate.

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:43.386
I realize now that her being a woman will
prevent her from ever becoming a man.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:57.324
You know, there are
things in life that men do

01:14:58.369 --> 01:15:00.110
and there are things in life
that women do.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.280
There are some things
that women and men do together,

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:06.624
like ride a tandem bicycle
or have sex.

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:11.038
But even then, men ride a tandem bicycle
to please the woman

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.002
and sex is
the other way around.

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:16.588
Karate...

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.547
Karate's a thing for men.

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:24.802
It's time
for the night class.

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:34.311
I just wanted to say
thank you for the belts.

01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:38.027
Oh. Of course. Yeah.
I'm so glad you like them.

01:15:38.492 --> 01:15:40.575
Like it? I love it.

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:43.905
Now, while I'm walking
around in public,

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.080
I can still feel
like a brown belt

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:49.451
by wearing this brown belt.
Thank you.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:54.623
Tonight, I want you, you,

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:59.552
and you.

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:02.843
How big is your head?

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.092
Uh, regular size.

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:08.015
Finish getting dressed.
Meet me out the back.

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:35.880
I don't think
I can do this.

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:39.675
Did you hear me?
I can't do this.

01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:43.008
Yes, you can.
You'll be fine.

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.551
- You're not coming.
- I'm coming.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:46.800
- We don't need you.
- Casey can take my place as runner.

01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:48.097
I'll be the driver
this time.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:49.956
Otherwise you'll only have
three drivers and one runner.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.620
You need the extra runner
and you know it.

01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:00.355
Put it on. Do it.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.830
<i>I want you two
to play spotters.</i>

01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:32.137
We'll do it.

01:17:33.023 --> 01:17:34.059
No.

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:36.559
You're lucky I even let you
ride with us tonight.

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:38.026
Thomas is
too recognizable.

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:39.673
You can see his disgusting face
and bandages

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:40.733
even with
the helmet on.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.823
Casey has to do it.
He needs to prove himself.

01:17:45.786 --> 01:17:48.950
<i>It's time, Casey.
Go find us someone to help.</i>

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:51.372
<i>They have to be alone.</i>

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.738
You should have never
started taking karate, Casey.

01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:05.594
- But you did.
- We don't have to do this.

01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:06.800
He'll kill us if we don't.

01:18:20.237 --> 01:18:23.071
Everything's gonna be okay,
but one of us has to hurt him, Casey.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:24.860
I can't.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:27.488
Then wait here.

01:18:31.415 --> 01:18:32.451
Who are you?

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:35.371
Stop!

01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:39.872
Police! Stop! Show me
your hands! Police!

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:42.464
Shit.

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:45.210
I didn't mean to shoot your friend.
Please, stop.

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:47.128
Stop where you are!
Show me your hands!

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.006
It was an accident.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.028
Casey!

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:14.535
Casey!

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:20.253
Casey! Casey,
we have to leave now!

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:10.262
<i>They got our guy.
He's dead. They got away.</i>

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:13.764
You know, one of the jobs
of the spotter

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:15.724
is to ask the person
if they have a gun.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:18.632
And that man had a gun.
Why didn't you ask if he had a gun?

01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:21.477
My kicks aren't gonna be
so strong anymore.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.391
The bullet
only grazed you.

01:20:25.029 --> 01:20:26.691
Imprecise and boorish.

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:28.438
Hey, this is your fault.

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:31.366
Remind me to put a red stripe
on your belt tomorrow.

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:34.064
What? The stripe for instructors?
You... You can keep that.

01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:37.785
Red stripes aren't for instructors.
It's for ending a life.

01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:41.001
Red represents blood.
There's no stripe for instructors.

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:44.462
A yellow belt with both
black and red stripes...

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:47.089
Unprecedented.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:50.923
- Thomas, take Anna home.
- No.

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:53.009
I'll do it.

01:20:57.644 --> 01:20:59.351
So, how did you get yours?

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.471
This one on the right.

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:08.190
My what?

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:12.566
Your stripe.
The red one.

01:21:16.246 --> 01:21:17.782
It was another student.

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:21.874
He was a belt above me.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.914
The highest ranked at the time,
other than Sensei.

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:26.374
I was better than him.

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:30.880
I knew it, but I also
knew my place.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.218
And during
the sparring sessions,

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.508
I let him win 'cause I didn't want to
upset the hierarchy.

01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:37.723
As you've probably noticed,
there's a hierarchy in karate.

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.386
At this point,
the dojo only had

01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:42.645
one changing room,

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:46.183
so I would wait until
the men finished changing,

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:47.601
then I would
get dressed alone.

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:51.646
And one night, as I was
getting undressed,

01:21:51.698 --> 01:21:54.441
the upper belt came in
and attacked me from behind.

01:21:56.453 --> 01:21:58.365
I'd always
held back in class,

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:00.784
so he saw me as weak.

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:03.870
An easy target.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.255
I ended up strangling him
to death with his own belt.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.134
I made him suffer.

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:17.968
And the last thing he saw
before his eyes burst was

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:20.721
the sense of satisfaction
on my face.

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:24.854
He saw that I was not weak,

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:27.516
but strong.

01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:31.360
I've never held
anything back since.

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:35.532
After that, Sensei had
the old equipment closet

01:22:35.576 --> 01:22:37.238
converted into the women's
changing room.

01:22:37.536 --> 01:22:40.574
He said that I had
tempted the upper belt.

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.164
That it was my fault.

01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:49.374
But it wasn't your fault.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.419
I know.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:01.508
Thanks for the ride.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.352
I hope I never see you
in class again, Casey.

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:08.598
I hope you leave and never
come back. I really do.

01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:43.460
<i>You're gonna kill him.</i>

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:46.504
<i>He's trying to kill him.</i>

01:27:47.137 --> 01:27:49.532
<i>You think you're the only one
that deserves a red stripe?</i>

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:52.549
<i>I deserve a red stripe
just as much as you. Maybe more.</i>

01:27:53.185 --> 01:27:54.892
<i>He looks very weak
and hopeless.</i>

01:27:55.812 --> 01:27:58.555
<i>Chances of him making something of
his life are minimal.</i>

01:27:59.649 --> 01:28:01.606
<i>- Go ahead.
- Wait.</i>

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:03.727
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.066
<i>Sirens.</i>

01:28:06.823 --> 01:28:08.030
<i>I hear sirens.</i>

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:09.650
<i>I don't hear anything.</i>

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:12.513
<i>Women are much more sensitive
to higher-pitched sounds than men.</i>

01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:14.699
<i>Trust me. I hear sirens approaching.
We should leave.</i>

01:28:17.542 --> 01:28:18.578
<i>Take his wallet.</i>

01:31:27.983 --> 01:31:29.144
I'm going to kill you.

01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:33.193
Do you want
to know why?

01:31:36.366 --> 01:31:39.154
I could say it's for
the honor of the dojo.

01:31:40.704 --> 01:31:44.243
I could tell you it's because you're
blackmailing former students

01:31:44.249 --> 01:31:46.787
into paying membership fees
long after they leave.

01:31:48.628 --> 01:31:53.419
Or because private lessons are given
to those who do not ask for them.

01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:55.708
Like myself.

01:31:57.971 --> 01:32:00.429
But really
it's because I hate you.

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:04.342
I hate you very much.

01:32:05.937 --> 01:32:08.429
And not only do I want
to watch you die,

01:32:08.815 --> 01:32:11.649
but I want to be the reason
that you stop breathing.

01:32:13.403 --> 01:32:16.237
I've never wanted anything
more in my entire life.

01:32:19.159 --> 01:32:21.116
I'm going to
kill you, Leslie.

01:32:26.249 --> 01:32:27.285
That's right.

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:30.330
I found out that
your real name is Leslie.

01:32:31.337 --> 01:32:33.249
I called you that
to make you angry.

01:32:34.466 --> 01:32:35.877
When you think about it,

01:32:35.925 --> 01:32:39.134
Leslie is a lot more
feminine-sounding than Casey.

01:32:41.931 --> 01:32:43.467
I can make you a black belt.

01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:46.805
You can skip all the other colors.
You don't even need to earn it.

01:32:50.315 --> 01:32:53.774
I challenge you to a fight to the death,
in unarmed combat.

01:32:56.362 --> 01:32:57.443
You'll lose.

01:32:59.741 --> 01:33:01.232
I'm better at fighting
than you.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:10.954
Very well.

01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:14.124
I accept.

01:34:46.389 --> 01:34:48.176
I've been thinking
a lot lately,

01:34:48.892 --> 01:34:51.179
about what I would say to you
after I killed you.

01:34:52.979 --> 01:34:54.436
I came up with two things,

01:34:55.064 --> 01:34:57.647
and I don't want to second-guess
my choice later on,

01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:59.141
so I'm going to say both.

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:05.777
First, you would say that using
this makes me a weak man,

01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:07.699
and without question,
it does.

01:35:08.578 --> 01:35:11.116
But I am alive
and you are dead,

01:35:11.331 --> 01:35:14.199
so I would argue
it makes you the weaker man.

01:35:17.086 --> 01:35:20.250
The second thing I came up
with is from a film I saw once.

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:23.503
I didn't play by the rules,

01:35:24.636 --> 01:35:26.798
but there never
were any rules.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.268
I defeated him in unarmed combat
to the death.

01:35:42.862 --> 01:35:44.899
In the tradition
of our Grand Master,

01:35:44.906 --> 01:35:47.649
I punched a hole through his head
with my index finger.

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:52.619
It was a move that only Grand Master knew
but now I know it too.

01:35:53.206 --> 01:35:57.450
I did it to restore honor to Grand Master,
this academy and its students.

01:35:57.919 --> 01:35:59.626
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

01:35:59.629 --> 01:36:02.963
Because if you do, I'm happy to punch
my finger through your skull too.

01:36:08.221 --> 01:36:10.759
Good. I've killed
enough people for today.

01:36:12.183 --> 01:36:14.721
On second thought,
there is one more thing.

01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:17.598
Everyone hold their hands out
in front of them.

01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:22.391
Don't make me ask again.

01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:49.885
What's this for?

01:36:51.597 --> 01:36:53.054
I sprained my wrist.

01:36:54.392 --> 01:36:57.135
- How did you sprain it?
- Playing guitar.

01:36:57.854 --> 01:37:00.221
- I didn't know you played.
- I do.

01:37:01.024 --> 01:37:02.390
How are you
with chords and scales?

01:37:02.608 --> 01:37:05.521
I'm good with them.
I can play several songs quite well.

01:37:06.571 --> 01:37:09.131
What type of music were you playing
when you sprained your wrist?

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:10.693
Soft rock.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.034
- Take off the bandage.
- Why?

01:37:14.454 --> 01:37:17.663
Because it is impossible
to sprain your wrist playing soft rock.

01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:19.782
Only extreme metal
can do that.

01:37:40.146 --> 01:37:41.603
This is my new dog.

01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:43.188
We've come
to an understanding.

01:37:43.566 --> 01:37:45.148
He knows
that I'm the alpha.

01:38:03.252 --> 01:38:04.618
This is not mine.

01:38:06.923 --> 01:38:10.416
I took it,
but I did not earn it.

01:38:46.712 --> 01:38:48.294
Now get in line,
yellow belt.

01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:06.393
Up until this point, you've been
taught that violence equals strength

01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:08.265
and compassion
equals weakness.

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:10.897
This ideology is limiting.

01:39:11.028 --> 01:39:15.193
It is possible to be brutally tolerant
or peacefully savage.

01:39:15.741 --> 01:39:19.280
Your karate mindset is equally as important
as your karate skill set.

01:39:21.164 --> 01:39:23.121
You're gonna notice
some changes around here,

01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:27.285
but this is still the night class
and you are still its students.

01:39:28.212 --> 01:39:29.248
Do you understand?

01:39:32.425 --> 01:39:33.541
Good.

01:39:34.552 --> 01:39:36.418
Let's start with
some moderate stretching.

01:39:47.356 --> 01:39:49.848
All right, students.
Let's start with some warm-ups.

01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:51.691
Jumping jacks.

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:57.861
One, two,
three, four, five, six...

01:39:57.867 --> 01:40:01.827
- Very good.
- ...seven, eight, nine, 10.

01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:05.618
Good. Everybody, well done.
Now let's do your side kicks.

01:40:17.428 --> 01:40:19.545
Very good side kicks.
Excellent form.

01:40:20.389 --> 01:40:24.178
Okay, everybody. Now we're doing
karate chops. Ready?

01:40:30.191 --> 01:40:31.477
Very good chops.

01:40:34.779 --> 01:40:37.442
Great job, Manny.
You've made great strides.

01:40:37.782 --> 01:40:38.989
All right, everybody.

01:40:38.991 --> 01:40:41.483
Now I'm going to teach you
how to kick with your fist,

01:40:41.494 --> 01:40:43.076
and punch with your foot.

01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:44.577
Are you ready?
