00:12.229 --> 00:15.148
I have some very big news, ma'am.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.100
POTUS isn't going
to run again in two years.

00:17.102 --> 00:20.103
I'm gonna run.
I'm gonna run for president!

00:20.105 --> 00:21.938
Together, we are going to make history.

00:21.940 --> 00:24.190
- My brain is at your service, ma'am.
- We'll see.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.526
- Can we make it public?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:26.577 --> 00:27.944
No. Got to wait for POTUS
to make a statement.

00:27.946 --> 00:30.613
- Okay.
- West Wing.

00:30.814 --> 00:33.487
__

00:33.500 --> 00:35.785
SELINA:
Well, you are so kind to say so.

00:35.787 --> 00:37.453
I appreciate it. Yeah.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.455
Thanks for coming today.

00:39.457 --> 00:41.341
Nice to see you.
Thank you so much.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.176
Come forward. Yeah.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.094
- Is this one a caucus-goer?
- Could be.

00:45.129 --> 00:48.047
Is that a "Star Wars" reference...
"A New Beginning"?

00:48.098 --> 00:52.385
No, this is actually "Some New Beginnings:
Our Next American Journey."

00:52.436 --> 00:54.354
Too late to change it?

00:54.388 --> 00:56.139
It is. Yeah.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.391
- Hello.
- This one's caucus.

00:58.442 --> 01:00.162
Oh, that's too loud.
Can't say it that loud.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.694
I think you're gonna dig it.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.112
Let's raise the minimum wage.

01:03.147 --> 01:04.897
Blind people are people too.

01:04.947 --> 01:06.282
A very enjoyable read...

01:06.316 --> 01:07.567
It's complex...

01:07.618 --> 01:08.651
I'm exhausted!

01:08.702 --> 01:10.453
The journey is endless, you know?

01:10.487 --> 01:12.655
Global issue...

01:12.706 --> 01:14.407
I call it "Some New Beginnings"

01:14.458 --> 01:16.292
because it's plural.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.245
God bless you... et cetera.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.964
AMY:
It's really nice, Gary.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.916
Looks lovely. Looks great.

01:23.967 --> 01:26.669
I can't believe Selina
chose not to be here.

01:26.671 --> 01:28.504
I told Sue to put
"wedding" in her calendar

01:28.555 --> 01:30.256
in bold cap letters.

01:30.307 --> 01:31.841
I mean, we took type size to a limit.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.394
If she could have been here,
which she could have,

01:34.428 --> 01:37.397
she would have.
But she's in Iowa for the book tour,

01:37.431 --> 01:39.515
fluffing caucus-goers
for the presidential run.

01:39.517 --> 01:41.851
I would hate to be that local Iowa
guy that's gotta take care of her,

01:41.935 --> 01:44.570
trying to source gazpacho in a
city that thinks soup is for fags.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.522
Nice day for a Mike wedding!

01:46.524 --> 01:48.775
(Cheering)

01:48.826 --> 01:51.277
You guys should all marry Wendy.
I feel amazing.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.080
You might even see me cry today
and for once it's not about work.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.366
- I'm a little nervous.
- Gary, I'm the one getting married.

01:57.368 --> 01:59.252
You just have to hand me
the vows, okay?

01:59.286 --> 02:01.254
- It's not the Olympic torch.
- GARY: I did the playlist too.

02:01.288 --> 02:04.373
Would you like me to mold the cake into
a pair of testicles for you, Gary?

02:04.375 --> 02:06.843
- GARY: Okay, easy.
- See what everyone's gifting us?

02:06.877 --> 02:10.012
"Some New Beginnings:
Our Next American Journey."

02:10.047 --> 02:12.548
- DAN: Really well written... by me.
- They think it's funny.

02:12.599 --> 02:14.600
Selina's never been away
so long without us before.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.302
I guess this is what it's gonna be like

02:16.353 --> 02:17.770
when our kids go to
college too, huh, sweetie?

02:17.855 --> 02:20.966
- Yeah, dream the fuck on, Dan.
- I'm only being nice to you

02:21.050 --> 02:22.975
because I know Selina's gonna make me
the campaign manager.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.895
There is no campaign until the president
tells the world he's not running again.

02:25.897 --> 02:27.697
Yeah, but when is that gonna be?

02:27.731 --> 02:28.781
Christ, it's been two months already.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.233
Unless POTUS is chiseling

02:30.284 --> 02:31.484
his fucking statement out
of marble, I don't get it.

02:31.535 --> 02:33.286
Dan, Dan, Dan... inside voices.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.204
Mike's marrying a reporter.
They're everywhere.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.323
Yeah, everywhere.

02:37.374 --> 02:39.992
Look at you, Dan. You have more
nervous tics than a shoe bomber.

02:40.043 --> 02:41.410
SELINA:
Thank you.

02:41.412 --> 02:43.079
Yes, please come forward.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.748
Oh, wow. Look at this.
You've got an iPad.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.167
- Could you sign it?
- Ah. Okay...

02:48.218 --> 02:50.753
I'm not sure... maybe we'll find...

02:50.755 --> 02:52.421
- Sign the back.
- Oh, you want me to sign...

02:52.423 --> 02:57.426
That way, it's all your books are
signed by the vice president.

02:57.428 --> 03:01.097
Hi. Oh, what is this?
Is this butter?

03:01.148 --> 03:03.649
In the shape
of the great state of Iowa.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.853
- Oh.
- If it melted, would it become Texas?

03:08.238 --> 03:11.240
This is an absolutely...

03:11.275 --> 03:13.025
stunning butter sculpture.

03:13.076 --> 03:15.945
- Thank you.
- So, let's tweet a picture of that.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.914
- Lock that caucus-goer down.
- Yeah.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.283
And then let's find a
refrigerator to put that in.

03:20.285 --> 03:22.165
You know, butter doesn't
need to be refrigerated.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.836
It can be unrefrigerated
or refrigerated.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.456
- SELINA: That's not true.
- I think it's like a fruit that way.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.508
No.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.677
Are you getting this?
Rumor of a rumor.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.046
Is this POTUS finally announcing
he's not gonna run for re-election?

03:34.097 --> 03:35.631
Well, whatever it is, I'm hearing

03:35.682 --> 03:37.850
the West Wing is abuzz
like a fly in a shithouse.

03:37.885 --> 03:41.354
- Hi.
- Phone bowl.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.189
- Come on, put it in.
- DAN: I'm not even using it.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.058
I want the camera so I can get
pictures of this magical day.

03:46.109 --> 03:47.560
Either you put your phone
in the phone bowl

03:47.611 --> 03:49.061
or I put it in the punch bowl.

03:49.112 --> 03:51.147
Isn't she funny?
We crack up all the time.

03:51.149 --> 03:53.149
Even when we're having sex.

03:53.151 --> 03:54.734
You guys, I've been a
reporter for 18 years.

03:54.785 --> 03:57.236
If anything breaks, I promise
I will put it into the vows.

03:57.287 --> 04:00.540
Ahem... Amy, phone in the bowl.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.709
- No, no, I can't.
- MIKE: It'll be 40 minutes, tops.

04:03.744 --> 04:07.163
Come on. What if you were
marrying the man of your dreams?

04:08.298 --> 04:09.799
Okay, okay, I'm doing it.
I'm just...

04:09.833 --> 04:12.001
- Just let me...
- Look at those white little knuckles.

04:12.003 --> 04:14.804
- (Cheering)
- Freedom!

04:14.838 --> 04:17.505
It's like losing a limb. I can feel
a phantom phone ringing right now.

04:17.558 --> 04:20.843
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

04:20.845 --> 04:22.178
Is that lip shade "Coral Blush"?

04:22.180 --> 04:24.397
Yes, it is. Wow.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.149
- Nicely applied.
- I like him.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.235
I want to keep him.
Can I have him, please?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.770
- Just for the honeymoon.
- WENDY: Oh, good.

04:30.821 --> 04:31.938
He does bring baby wipes everywhere.

04:31.989 --> 04:34.657
You never know if we're
gonna need 'em when we...

04:34.691 --> 04:36.525
Okay.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.110
(Faint buzzing)

04:38.161 --> 04:40.696
Okay, the rumor's something
to do with Sec Def Maddox.

04:40.698 --> 04:42.865
He's making an announcement...
something big.

04:42.867 --> 04:44.533
Well, thank God
you packed a spare piece.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.436
Amy, a good campaign manager
always has to think one phone ahead.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.955
You're not a campaign manager yet.

04:49.006 --> 04:50.673
- We'll see.
- And I'm very disappointed

04:50.707 --> 04:53.376
(loudly) you have kept
a secret spare phone, Dan.

04:53.378 --> 04:55.628
And I likewise am disappointed
that you have not.

04:55.679 --> 04:56.762
Amateur.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.381
Thank you. Thank you.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.516
Just one second, please.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.603
(Whispering)
So, these rumors, right?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.238
I'm getting Maddox.
What are you getting?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.690
I'm not getting a huge
amount, if I'm being honest.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.393
- Hey, Richard, no offense...
- None taken.

05:10.395 --> 05:11.944
- You're a catastrophe.
- Okay.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.779
Okay. So, now, you need to call Mike.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.565
You got to get to the bottom of this.
Immediately. Right now.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.952
(Ringtone playing)

05:22.489 --> 05:24.206
It's the vice president.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.908
- Hey, ma'am.
- Oh, hang on, Mike.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.994
No disrespect meant.
It's the title.

05:28.045 --> 05:30.496
- It is a little confusing.
- No, it isn't.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.915
- It's Mike.
- Could you deal with this...

05:32.966 --> 05:35.051
- ...wonderfully honest woman?
- Sure will.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.919
- Uh, Mike?
- Hello, ma'am?

05:36.921 --> 05:39.972
Listen, have you had a chance to
talk to any of the press guys?

05:40.007 --> 05:42.925
Yes, it is a wonderful day today.

05:42.927 --> 05:46.062
Look, you maybe want to say
hello to Wendy real quick?

05:46.096 --> 05:49.348
Oh, yeah, I'd love to speak
to Wendy... very briefly.

05:49.399 --> 05:52.101
It's the Vice President
of the United States.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.020
- WENDY: Hello?
- Hi, Wendy.

05:54.071 --> 05:55.404
Congratulations.

05:55.439 --> 05:58.157
Oh, thank you so much,
Madam Vice President.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.276
- You've met her, you can call her "ma'am."
- Ma'am.

06:00.278 --> 06:02.161
Yeah, such a happy day
for both of you.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.448
It happened so fast.
Mike just makes me laugh.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.283
As a matter of fact,
the first time we met,

06:07.334 --> 06:09.418
I was carrying this
cheese Danish and...

06:09.453 --> 06:12.371
Then you got married.
And I love that story.

06:12.422 --> 06:14.290
Sorry I couldn't be there.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.925
Oh, it's no problem.
You're in Iowa,

06:15.959 --> 06:17.510
and, you know,
you have to suckle Iowa.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.345
- If anybody knows, I know.
- She's at a book signing.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.013
How is your
book signing going, ma'am?

06:21.048 --> 06:23.265
Oh, it's going spectacularly well.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.769
We've got a great team working here.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.138
Listen, is Mike still there?

06:29.222 --> 06:32.942
- Um... Mike is not.
- Okay. Bye-bye. Thanks.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.394
- Fuck.
- Hey, ma'am? Hey, it's Gar...

06:35.445 --> 06:37.613
- Oh, got to go.
- Going back in the bowl.

06:38.663 --> 06:40.343
REPORTER:
Strong rumors today there may be

06:40.367 --> 06:42.952
a major announcement coming
from the Defense Department...

06:42.986 --> 06:44.737
Okay, Defense Secretary Maddox
has slipped his leash.

06:44.788 --> 06:47.156
REPORTER:
...Maddox has so far refused to comment...

06:47.158 --> 06:49.291
Somebody get me actual
intel from the Pentagon.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.543
I feel like I'm Joe Public here...

06:50.577 --> 06:52.461
I know nothing.
And I don't like that feeling.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.726
Would you like to go for dinner
with us later?

06:54.805 --> 06:56.063
No.

06:56.098 --> 06:58.667
- What's your favorite word?
- Next!

06:58.719 --> 07:00.970
(Chuckles)

07:01.004 --> 07:02.388
Do you think I offended her?

07:02.422 --> 07:05.174
- Can you write "To Alice..."
- Mm-hmm.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.561
"...this is to get you back"?

07:08.595 --> 07:11.013
I think I need to decompress

07:11.015 --> 07:12.481
- just for a few seconds.
- Absolutely.

07:12.516 --> 07:15.151
Understood, I'm brain-dead
just watching you.

07:16.319 --> 07:18.187
I'm going back to the hotel.

07:18.189 --> 07:20.189
Absolutely.
What shall I tell these people?

07:20.191 --> 07:22.108
Gary just usually makes up an excuse.

07:22.159 --> 07:25.194
Ladies and gentlemen, the vice president
has to step out for a moment

07:25.245 --> 07:27.079
to take a phone call with a senator.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.831
Mm-hmm.
He's having a big problem.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.334
Um... pfft! It's...

07:32.369 --> 07:35.171
I will be back very soon.
Thank you so much.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.705
Okay?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.010
Whew.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.797
Oh, God.

07:47.551 --> 07:50.052
"Love is patient, love is kind.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.439
It is not jealous, is not pompous..."

07:53.473 --> 07:54.857
(Faint buzzing)

07:54.891 --> 07:57.393
"It is not inflated, it is not rude..."

07:57.444 --> 08:00.446
(Faint buzzing)

08:00.480 --> 08:02.948
"It does not seek its own interests..."

08:02.983 --> 08:04.400
(Buzzing)

08:04.402 --> 08:06.485
"It is not quick-tempered,
it does not brood over injury,"

08:06.536 --> 08:08.737
it does not rejoice over wrongdoing.

08:08.739 --> 08:11.407
"Love bears all things,
believes all things..."

08:11.409 --> 08:15.161
(stammers) sends... love... ends...
"Love never ends."

08:16.046 --> 08:17.463
Ahem.

08:23.887 --> 08:26.005
Oh, my God.

08:26.056 --> 08:29.758
I will love you more
today than yesterday,

08:29.760 --> 08:33.929
but you are always
all of my tomorrows.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.932
Oh!

08:36.933 --> 08:38.851
I am but a satellite

08:38.902 --> 08:42.688
caught in the gravity
of your planet, Wendy.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.530
(Thumps)

08:53.450 --> 08:55.618
I was headed for the fall

08:55.620 --> 08:58.954
when you, Michael,
gave me back my spring.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.957
(Thumps)

09:06.763 --> 09:10.132
My official statement
to the press reads thus...

09:10.134 --> 09:12.968
"We are in love, come celebrate."

09:18.058 --> 09:20.643
- (Knocking on door)
- BEN: Stand aside, asshole.

09:20.645 --> 09:22.645
- SELINA: Ben?
- RICHARD: You catch more flies with honey

09:22.647 --> 09:24.613
than with bad language.

09:24.648 --> 09:27.700
- SELINA: Hi, Ben!
- The Chief of Staff of the President.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.902
Get out of the way,
or I'll fucking inhale you.

09:29.953 --> 09:33.155
Good to see your friendly-ish face-ish!

09:33.157 --> 09:36.075
- Who?
- Oh, it's nothing.

09:36.126 --> 09:37.910
Listen, you need to get me some Advil,

09:37.961 --> 09:39.628
'cause I got some people in here.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.330
- Okay?
- Consider it done.

09:41.332 --> 09:43.332
Do you have a preference on water?
Because I'm all about Fiji.

09:43.334 --> 09:44.466
You dress is open.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.920
- Oh...!
- Wow. The Elk Suite!

09:47.971 --> 09:49.054
Yeah.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.141
What are you doing here?

09:52.175 --> 09:54.226
I'm on my way
to Congressman Cowgill's funeral.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.429
Oh, right. Poor Rick Cowgill.

09:57.480 --> 10:01.350
God, he was a four-foot-
11-inch stick of dynamite.

10:01.401 --> 10:04.103
A great man inside a small man.

10:04.154 --> 10:06.405
Stick one of those in Ricky's hand,

10:06.439 --> 10:08.324
he would have looked
like an average-sized man.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.825
Mm.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.078
- So where's the team?
- They're at Mike's wedding.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.998
- I kinda miss 'em.
- (Phone buzzing)

10:16.032 --> 10:18.918
Oh, it's just Gary.
Press "ignore."

10:18.952 --> 10:23.038
- I now pronounce you husband and wife...
- (Groans)

10:23.089 --> 10:25.174
(Applause)

10:26.543 --> 10:29.428
All right, all you single ladies...

10:29.462 --> 10:31.463
WENDY:
I don't wanna do it.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.882
JONAH:
Whoo... coming through.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.852
I got a jet here that could
cut a fucking diamond.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.854
What the hell are you doing here?
You weren't invited.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.639
Unless you're the "worst man."

10:40.690 --> 10:42.558
No, I live down the
street from Pam Kendall.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.161
Her car broke down,
so I gave her a lift.

10:44.194 --> 10:45.361
"Pentagon Pam"?

10:45.395 --> 10:46.862
She give you any hint on
the Maddox announcement?

10:46.896 --> 10:48.063
Nah, she didn't give me anything.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.982
Except for flirty glances.

10:50.033 --> 10:51.617
What's that stubby thing
you got there?

10:51.651 --> 10:54.486
"WestWingMan.net"?
Never heard of this.

10:54.537 --> 10:56.405
Come on, man.
You're embarrassing yourself.

10:56.407 --> 10:58.374
That's the hottest gossip site in DC.

10:58.408 --> 11:02.077
Yeah? "Lifting the lid on the
Interagency Softball League"?

11:02.128 --> 11:04.079
"Face To Face with
America's Wind Tycoons."

11:04.130 --> 11:07.299
Wow. This is some seriously
butter knife-dull shit, man.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.335
No, no, no.
Underneath, that's grit legit.

11:09.386 --> 11:11.170
So what's "WestWingMan"
got on the Maddox thing?

11:11.221 --> 11:12.471
Nothing yet. But he will.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.592
If it ain't on "WestWingMan,"
it ain't nothing, man.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.346
It's you, isn't it?

11:20.397 --> 11:23.432
- Who told you that?
- You just did, you dummy.

11:23.434 --> 11:27.102
Fuck! God!
Keep that under your hat.

11:27.153 --> 11:28.737
- Yeah. Sure.
- That's just between you and me.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.740
Now if you will excuse me,
I am at a wedding,

11:31.775 --> 11:34.443
and women at a wedding are
like ripe fruit ready to drop.

11:34.445 --> 11:36.745
And I am a sex wasp.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.080
Gonna wash those paws, huh, big guy?

11:38.114 --> 11:40.616
Are you kidding?
My pheromones make bitches moan.

11:40.618 --> 11:43.535
I'm gonna leave a trail
right back to my apartment.

11:45.288 --> 11:48.007
Look at us.
You pretending to be me

11:48.041 --> 11:50.009
signing a book I didn't even write.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.928
- That's politics in a nutsack.
- Yeah.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.015
"New Beginnings:
Our Next American Journey."

11:56.049 --> 11:57.633
What do you think of that title?

11:57.635 --> 11:59.134
It's so full of shit,

11:59.136 --> 12:00.969
there's a colon right
smack-dab in the middle.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.889
Oh, God. They kept coming up
with all of these awful titles.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.941
You wouldn't even have believed it...

12:05.975 --> 12:08.944
like, "Footsteps to the Future"
was one.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.481
"Red, White and You"
was actually another one.

12:12.483 --> 12:14.233
Yes. "Hands of Our Children."

12:14.284 --> 12:16.151
- BEN: What?
- Like a massacre or something.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.703
- Fuckin' sick.
- I know.

12:17.787 --> 12:20.322
I was so busy listening
to these stupid fucks,

12:20.324 --> 12:23.492
I didn't listen to this voice
in my own head saying,

12:23.543 --> 12:26.328
"This is dog shit.
Selina, this is complete dog shit.

12:26.330 --> 12:29.331
Don't step in it, don't...
ah, you just stepped in it."

12:29.333 --> 12:31.333
Now look, it's printed in
a book, so that's good.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.169
Look, don't listen
to those DC assholes, then.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.337
You're out amongst the real people now.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.755
These are the people that you love.

12:36.806 --> 12:39.174
- This is your thing.
- You're right. It's true.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.260
So, do you want to be the
President of the United States?

12:41.311 --> 12:43.929
I want to be president. It's just
that I'm staring down the barrel

12:43.980 --> 12:46.732
of 18 months
of this shit, you know?

12:46.816 --> 12:49.435
- 18 months, it's nothing.
- 18 months is not nothing.

12:49.486 --> 12:50.936
18 months is an entire pregnancy

12:50.987 --> 12:53.605
with another entire pregnancy
tacked onto the end of it.

12:53.656 --> 12:55.107
Well, I'm a pretty good
strategy guy.

12:55.158 --> 12:57.526
- Mm.
- I could be your midwife.

12:57.528 --> 13:00.362
You know, get my hands dirty?

13:01.865 --> 13:04.116
Um... could you go sit in
that chair over there?

13:04.167 --> 13:06.034
Oh, yeah.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.170
All right, listen.
Midwife me this, then.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.372
Campaign manager...

13:10.374 --> 13:11.790
Dan or Amy?

13:11.841 --> 13:14.176
Look, forget about Amy,
forget about Dan.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.212
Two words... Bill Ericsson.

13:17.214 --> 13:18.680
No way. He's not available.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.048
He is available, all right?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.517
And he's going to be
at Cowgill's funeral.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.352
So, let's go talk to him.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.938
Oh, my God, he's got
the Midas playbook.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.723
- He got Briggs elected...
- Twice.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.141
Twice. That's what I'm saying.

13:29.192 --> 13:30.976
So it should be easier for you.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.945
- You actually have a personality.
- That's right, I do.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.147
- And you never grope waitresses.
- Right.

13:35.198 --> 13:37.399
All right, let's go!
Let's go meet and grieve.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.701
We'll meet Ericsson, and
we'll grieve little Ricky.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.070
- Yeah, God rest his tiny soul.
- I know.

13:42.072 --> 13:45.157
You know, I heard that dog picked
him up and shook him really bad.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.075
(Laughs)

13:47.077 --> 13:49.411
Ladies and gentlemen, sadly,

13:49.462 --> 13:51.743
the vice president will not be
back to finish the signing.

13:51.786 --> 13:53.069
MAN:
What?

13:53.120 --> 13:55.572
The senator who I mentioned earlier...

13:55.623 --> 14:00.126
His problems have become even bigger.

14:00.161 --> 14:02.162
Come on, let's go.
EEOB peeps, let's go.

14:02.164 --> 14:04.330
This is my last wedding.
Come on.

14:04.382 --> 14:07.300
Whoa, Jonah,
Eisenhower people only. Go.

14:07.334 --> 14:08.885
Well, then, what is Wendy
doing in the photo, Mike?

14:08.969 --> 14:10.570
- She doesn't work there, does she?
- Go.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.422
Jonah, what's the point?
You don't show up in photographs.

14:12.473 --> 14:13.840
The sooner we do this,
the sooner we get it done.

14:13.851 --> 14:16.052
Right? The sooner we do this,
the sooner we get it done.

14:16.060 --> 14:17.260
- Okay?
- AMY: Yeah, yeah.

14:17.311 --> 14:20.847
- 5D? I've got a 1D.
- (Phone buzzing)

14:20.931 --> 14:23.016
You keep a second phone there?

14:23.067 --> 14:25.602
Hypocritical. And horny.

14:25.653 --> 14:28.188
- Okay, one, two...
- Shit on my tits.

14:28.190 --> 14:30.824
- Maddox just resigned.
- What, the Sec Def's gone?

14:30.858 --> 14:33.610
Okay, okay, you can have your
phones for five minutes, guys.

14:33.661 --> 14:35.695
The Wi-Fi password
is "Starboard135A."

14:35.746 --> 14:37.747
- Where's the phone bowl?
- I don't know where the phone bowl is.

14:37.782 --> 14:40.750
- I need my primary phone.
- Shut up! Shut up, everybody!

14:40.785 --> 14:43.253
- (Faint ringtones buzzing)
- It's right here.

14:43.287 --> 14:46.005
Is Maddox running for president?
Is that what this is?

14:46.040 --> 14:48.041
(Chuckles)
I already have mine.

14:48.092 --> 14:49.759
"'Team Veep' goes into meltdown

14:49.794 --> 14:52.095
as Sec Def Maddox news breaks."

14:52.129 --> 14:54.047
And upload the money shot.

14:54.049 --> 14:56.099
I hate how he learned
English from pornography.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.267
Did you just post that?

14:57.301 --> 14:58.852
I run a "gossip-tainment" site

14:58.886 --> 15:01.387
and this is very gossip-taining.

15:01.439 --> 15:03.556
(Groans)

15:07.361 --> 15:09.395
Sorry, guys. Not gonna
take any questions now.

15:09.447 --> 15:11.648
Secretary Maddox will be
making a statement later today.

15:11.699 --> 15:13.233
This is not a crisis.

15:13.284 --> 15:16.653
Stop flapping your vestigial limbs around.
The line on Maddox

15:16.704 --> 15:19.239
is one more old man has gone
off to play chess in the park.

15:19.290 --> 15:22.158
And somebody find out
who "WestWingMan" is.

15:22.209 --> 15:25.295
FYI, it may not be his real name.

15:25.329 --> 15:27.547
SELINA:
Looks like Maddox is making a move.

15:27.574 --> 15:29.415
We're going to need
Ericsson now, am I right?

15:29.417 --> 15:32.051
Now more than ever. Seriously.

15:32.086 --> 15:33.586
Dan, listen. We're going
to have to do something

15:33.637 --> 15:35.922
if Maddox is actually gonna run.

15:35.973 --> 15:38.308
Yes, ma'am, yes. I was voted
"Most Likely To Do Something Now"

15:38.342 --> 15:40.894
- in my class yearbook.
- Just get on it.

15:40.928 --> 15:43.513
- Running for what, ma'am?
- BEN: Yeah. Listen, bumpkin...

15:43.564 --> 15:45.098
You blurt out anything to anyone

15:45.149 --> 15:47.901
about Maddox running or
POTUS deciding not to run,

15:47.935 --> 15:49.769
the closest you'll get
to a political career

15:49.820 --> 15:53.406
will be selling Nixon masks
at a Halloween shop, okay?

15:53.440 --> 15:55.158
POTUS isn't seeking re-election?

15:55.192 --> 15:56.359
BEN:
I said don't blurt. You blurted.

15:56.410 --> 15:58.778
- You blurted first.
- You blurted about running.

15:58.780 --> 16:01.114
- RICHARD: You're running?
- (Selina squeaks)

16:01.116 --> 16:04.834
Ben, can you not keep a cat in
a bag for one fuckin' second?

16:04.869 --> 16:06.336
Now we're gonna have to kill him.

16:06.370 --> 16:08.454
Ma'am, if you need any
help with your campaign,

16:08.456 --> 16:10.623
I'm real good in
a high-pressure situation.

16:10.674 --> 16:12.759
Really? In what sense good?

16:12.793 --> 16:15.011
I was all over that book line thing.

16:15.095 --> 16:17.347
Yeah. I tell you what, get the driver
to turn the air conditioning on, okay?

16:17.381 --> 16:18.715
'Cause I'm boiling up here.

16:18.766 --> 16:21.267
I can do that!

16:21.302 --> 16:23.686
- How do I do that?
- Just open the door while we're moving,

16:23.721 --> 16:25.638
climb under the car
like Indiana Jones,

16:25.689 --> 16:28.641
pop up on the hood and write
a note on the windshield.

16:28.643 --> 16:31.978
All right! Time to cut
the cake, everybody!

16:32.029 --> 16:34.564
Watch out! My wife has a knife!

16:35.649 --> 16:37.200
I think the optimal size
for each slice

16:37.234 --> 16:39.285
is about a half inch
for everybody, all right?

16:39.320 --> 16:40.570
- I got about a half inch for you.
- (Chuckles)

16:40.621 --> 16:41.871
- You exaggerate.
- Okay.

16:41.906 --> 16:44.824
- Here we go.
- (Guests cheering)

16:44.875 --> 16:46.993
Texting behind your back? Jesus.

16:47.044 --> 16:48.545
- You "Hendrix texting"?
- Just staying ahead.

16:48.579 --> 16:50.296
- That's what a good campaign manager does.
- No.

16:50.331 --> 16:53.049
No, a good campaign manager, Amy...

16:53.083 --> 16:56.169
Excuse me,
I'm about to be brilliant.

16:56.171 --> 16:58.838
GARY:
Ah!

16:58.840 --> 17:00.920
You guys are just like
two little pretty Easter eggs.

17:00.925 --> 17:02.508
I'd love to crack you open.

17:02.510 --> 17:04.394
Hey, Hepatitis J.

17:04.428 --> 17:06.061
How's that pic you posted
on your blog going, huh?

17:06.146 --> 17:07.763
It's a hashtag hurricane,
bitch tits.

17:07.815 --> 17:09.482
You don't think maybe you
should take that down?

17:09.516 --> 17:11.935
You don't think you
should go fist a chimp?

17:11.986 --> 17:14.020
Well, it's just that
you showing us panicking

17:14.021 --> 17:16.356
makes it seem like the Maddox resignation
is somehow significant to us.

17:16.358 --> 17:17.829
Mm-hmm.

17:17.944 --> 17:20.191
'Cause he would be
a big rival for Selina.

17:20.226 --> 17:22.412
Ooh.

17:22.445 --> 17:24.030
Who wants to run for president...?

17:24.080 --> 17:26.031
Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.

17:26.034 --> 17:29.285
Because the President of the United States
is not going to run again.

17:29.336 --> 17:33.790
- So?
- So the president has not yet announced

17:33.841 --> 17:36.092
that he's not gonna run again.

17:37.344 --> 17:39.295
That's no problem.
I'll just take it down.

17:39.346 --> 17:41.826
Yeah, yeah. Just make sure you
do that before Google caches it,

17:41.849 --> 17:44.017
because once that happens, it's on
there till the end of the world,

17:44.051 --> 17:45.969
which will also
probably be your fault.

17:46.020 --> 17:49.111
- What's Google's number?
- I don't know. Ask Jeeves.

17:49.146 --> 17:50.529
Do you know anybody at the NSA?

17:50.564 --> 17:52.732
Does anybody here know
anybody at the NSA?

17:54.534 --> 17:57.620
Oh, I see you here on this sad day.

17:57.654 --> 18:00.656
Okay, that's Isaac Denisov from Change.org.
She hates him.

18:00.707 --> 18:02.124
This way, ma'am. You hate him.

18:02.159 --> 18:04.326
Oh, yeah. That's the first
one you've got right today.

18:04.378 --> 18:06.379
He's a douche.
We've gotta find Ericsson.

18:06.413 --> 18:08.798
I'll know when I see him.
I never forget a JPEG.

18:08.832 --> 18:11.751
- Blake Stewart alert.
- Madam Vice President.

18:11.753 --> 18:14.136
Blake Stewart. Oh, my goodness.

18:14.171 --> 18:17.173
Blake won the nomination
a decade ago

18:17.224 --> 18:18.924
and lost disastrously.

18:18.975 --> 18:20.810
He's gonna throw Selina off her game.

18:20.844 --> 18:22.344
- Why?
- Why?

18:22.396 --> 18:24.313
He's the bubonic fuckin'
plague of this party.

18:24.347 --> 18:26.849
- I see you're doing a book tour.
- I am, yes.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.819
- Are you thinking of running?
- Oh, no, no, no.

18:29.853 --> 18:33.522
- I'm just hawking books.
- You are gonna deny that for six years,

18:33.573 --> 18:35.024
then you'll run anyway.

18:35.075 --> 18:36.942
What was it like,
the campaign, for you?

18:36.944 --> 18:39.445
Exciting... then exhausting.

18:39.496 --> 18:41.831
- Ah.
- Then I died.

18:41.865 --> 18:45.251
(Chuckles)
Joking. Kinda.

18:45.285 --> 18:47.870
Well, you're out of it now,
so that's good.

18:47.921 --> 18:50.256
I used to think that I
failed because of my team...

18:50.290 --> 18:51.957
I didn't have the right chief of staff,

18:52.008 --> 18:53.926
campaign manager, comms guys,

18:53.960 --> 18:55.261
my then wife... but, no.

18:55.295 --> 18:58.631
It was me. I just didn't have it.

18:58.633 --> 19:00.883
- Well, very few of us do.
- Right.

19:00.934 --> 19:03.719
- Like Cowgill.
- Poor Cowgill.

19:03.770 --> 19:06.021
I kinda wish it was me in that box.

19:07.607 --> 19:08.928
It's good speaking with you, Mike.

19:08.942 --> 19:10.893
Really? Oh, thanks.

19:10.944 --> 19:13.946
- I don't hear that a lot.
- Oh...

19:15.482 --> 19:18.150
- Oh... ma'am?
- Yes?

19:18.201 --> 19:21.120
The prime minister of Scotland
is on the line right now.

19:21.154 --> 19:23.405
- It sounds important.
- Oh, great.

19:23.457 --> 19:26.792
Important, yes. Would you
excuse me for a second? Hello?

19:26.827 --> 19:29.495
Well, you know what?

19:29.497 --> 19:31.497
We could consummate
this marriage right here.

19:31.499 --> 19:33.415
No one would notice or give a shit.

19:33.467 --> 19:34.750
- MIKE: We could.
- Mm-hmm.

19:34.801 --> 19:36.969
- Or...?
- Or?

19:37.003 --> 19:40.055
- We could check our phones.
- WENDY: Gary?

19:41.975 --> 19:44.059
- Madam Vice President?
- Yes?

19:44.094 --> 19:47.897
- I was Rick's nephew.
- Are you kidding me?

19:47.931 --> 19:49.732
This is Cowgill's nephew.

19:49.766 --> 19:52.234
GARY: If they tell her who they are,
you don't have to say anything.

19:52.269 --> 19:56.238
Mr. Stewart, this is the
poem we'd like you to read.

19:56.323 --> 20:00.025
Thank you. I've prepared
some closing words, too.

20:00.110 --> 20:03.329
I was gonna actually
ask the vice president

20:03.363 --> 20:05.698
if she would like to say something.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.583
No, it's fine.

20:07.617 --> 20:10.119
- I'm a terrible speaker anyway.
- No, you're not.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.587
Yeah. That's how I lost 49 states.

20:11.621 --> 20:14.290
No. Well...

20:14.341 --> 20:16.876
- Yeah. It is.
- Okay.

20:19.587 --> 20:21.547
JONAH: Hey. What's going on, man?
What's crackin'?

20:21.549 --> 20:24.383
- We got POTUS incoming?
- May I see your White House pass?

20:24.434 --> 20:27.636
Uh, yes, sir. Absolutely.

20:27.687 --> 20:30.189
There you are.

20:30.223 --> 20:31.607
Leave.

20:31.641 --> 20:33.559
- But I work here.
- Not anymore.

20:33.561 --> 20:35.861
Sir, I think I've temporarily
lost your meaning.

20:35.896 --> 20:38.364
SELINA: Dan, did you go running
back to the White House?

20:38.398 --> 20:39.899
What can I say,

20:39.901 --> 20:41.901
except it's a little spotty at
the center of the universe.

20:41.952 --> 20:43.869
The party is over,
"Mr. WestWingMan."

20:43.904 --> 20:46.322
There is a dead guy in the pool,
and that dead guy is you.

20:46.373 --> 20:47.573
I'm going to have to call you back.

20:47.624 --> 20:49.375
Something truly wonderful
has happened.

20:49.409 --> 20:52.211
I think there's been a misunderstanding...
No, hold on.

20:52.245 --> 20:53.913
One, you were running a news
blog while working in office.

20:53.915 --> 20:56.549
- It was gossip-tainment.
- Two, you posted a photo

20:56.583 --> 20:58.417
which roused the
suspicions of the press.

20:58.468 --> 21:00.669
It has been forwarded
to every hack in DC.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.055
That wasn't me. And I deleted it.

21:03.089 --> 21:04.723
Which made it even worse!

21:04.758 --> 21:07.259
The fact is that your post
has made it impossible

21:07.310 --> 21:08.928
to sit on the POTUS's
secret any longer,

21:08.930 --> 21:11.680
so as a direct result of your actions,

21:11.731 --> 21:13.482
the President of the United States

21:13.516 --> 21:16.318
is bringing forward
the announcement to today

21:16.353 --> 21:18.437
that he is not running for re-election.

21:18.439 --> 21:22.241
We'll alert the networks there's
gonna be a live announcement.

21:22.275 --> 21:24.994
Don't interrupt any major
sporting event unless it's golf.

21:25.078 --> 21:26.996
And get him out of here...
via his desk.

21:27.030 --> 21:28.530
Lord knows what you'll find in there.

21:28.582 --> 21:30.950
I'm sorry. I think you might
be overreacting to this.

21:30.952 --> 21:32.284
No, Terrence. What am I gonna do?
Am I gonna hit him?

21:32.335 --> 21:34.620
Sir, please, don't take
this away from me.

21:34.622 --> 21:37.623
The West Wing is part of
my DNA and vice versa.

21:37.674 --> 21:39.554
Okay, this is a teachable
moment, and I think...

21:39.593 --> 21:40.960
You're embarrassing yourself.

21:40.962 --> 21:43.212
Sir, I don't have
anything else in my life.

21:43.263 --> 21:46.298
- He really doesn't.
- See? Exactly. Thank you, Dan.

21:46.349 --> 21:48.384
- Fuck you, Dan!
- That'll be all, Mr. Ryan.

21:48.435 --> 21:51.303
- Sir, did POTUS okay this?
- Get him out of here!

21:52.472 --> 21:54.773
How did you survive Blake?

21:54.808 --> 21:56.392
- Tell me you're okay.
- Are you kidding me?

21:56.443 --> 21:59.278
That bag of wrist slits
got the nomination?

21:59.312 --> 22:01.981
With that face and that personality?

22:01.983 --> 22:03.816
I mean, look at what I got to work with.
Where's Ericsson?

22:03.818 --> 22:05.651
I just heard that he
bolted back to DC

22:05.702 --> 22:06.902
when the Maddox news came out.

22:06.987 --> 22:08.320
All right. Fuck it.

22:08.371 --> 22:10.906
I don't need a team, I don't
need a campaign manager.

22:10.957 --> 22:13.626
You think I got here just 'cause
I got $50 million in the bank

22:13.660 --> 22:16.662
- and this amazing ass?
- No.

22:16.664 --> 22:18.914
All right, Cowgill
was your congressman,

22:18.965 --> 22:20.845
so give me a couple of facts about him.
Go. Now.

22:20.884 --> 22:23.085
- He was an amazing fisherman.
- Okay.

22:23.136 --> 22:24.553
And he collected beer labels.

22:24.587 --> 22:26.422
What are you gonna do with that?

22:26.473 --> 22:28.374
I'm going to read a poem

22:28.408 --> 22:31.260
by Rick's granddaughter, Maeve.

22:31.311 --> 22:33.979
It's...

22:34.848 --> 22:37.349
Well, you'll see.

22:38.685 --> 22:40.853
"We love you,
and we'll miss your face,

22:40.855 --> 22:44.823
husband, father, granddad.

22:44.858 --> 22:47.993
You made the world a better place.

22:49.029 --> 22:51.080
and now you left it sad."

22:51.915 --> 22:55.451
(Organ plays)

23:03.877 --> 23:06.378
(Muttering faintly)

23:13.687 --> 23:15.854
(Organ stops)

23:15.889 --> 23:17.523
Good afternoon.

23:17.557 --> 23:21.443
Well, I was planning
on keeping this brief.

23:21.478 --> 23:23.729
In fact, I was gonna say short,

23:23.731 --> 23:26.699
but I know how sensitive
Rick was about his height.

23:26.733 --> 23:29.401
(Scattered laughter)

23:29.452 --> 23:31.453
You think you've seen
the end of Jonah Ryan?

23:31.488 --> 23:34.957
You haven't even seen
the start of Jonah Ryan!

23:35.041 --> 23:36.742
I'm leaving here
with my head held high

23:36.793 --> 23:39.962
and my nuts hanging low
on your mom's chin, Martin.

23:39.996 --> 23:42.965
You got your porn stash there!

23:42.999 --> 23:45.667
Any last words?

23:45.719 --> 23:47.169
Fuck you...

23:47.220 --> 23:49.588
(Laughter)

23:49.639 --> 23:52.891
Rick's life reflects America.

23:52.926 --> 23:54.927
He was an avid fisherman.

23:54.929 --> 23:57.563
And as a congressman,

23:57.597 --> 23:59.932
gosh, did he know

23:59.983 --> 24:03.602
how to cast upstream
to anticipate it.

24:03.604 --> 24:05.687
And when he got that first bite,

24:05.739 --> 24:07.689
whoa, did he reel it in.

24:07.741 --> 24:11.493
He was a nuanced politician

24:11.528 --> 24:14.830
with a mighty big collection
of beer labels.

24:14.864 --> 24:16.331
(Laughter)

24:16.366 --> 24:18.000
I'll be back.

24:18.034 --> 24:20.919
I'm gonna be back
as the fucking president.

24:20.954 --> 24:23.956
Jonah Ryan, 2026!

24:24.007 --> 24:26.125
That's a midterms year, Jonah.

24:26.176 --> 24:27.793
Well, then, I'll change it!

24:27.795 --> 24:29.928
I'm gonna miss you,
Rick Cowgill...

24:29.963 --> 24:32.431
fisherman...

24:32.465 --> 24:34.183
congressman...

24:34.217 --> 24:36.351
American.

24:36.386 --> 24:38.554
(Applause)

24:42.192 --> 24:45.144
Well, I blew the fuckin' roof
off of this church, didn't I?

24:45.146 --> 24:46.812
They loved that beer
labels anecdote.

24:46.863 --> 24:48.897
Why would anyone collect those?

24:48.948 --> 24:50.699
Yeah?

24:50.733 --> 24:52.818
Maddox canceled his statement,

24:52.902 --> 24:55.237
because POTUS
is going to make one...

24:55.288 --> 24:56.455
the big one.

24:56.489 --> 24:58.323
Are you saying what I
think you're saying?

24:58.325 --> 25:00.292
I'm never ambiguous, ma'am.
Not even sexually.

25:00.326 --> 25:02.744
Ben! I love politics.

25:02.796 --> 25:04.963
- Me too, ma'am.
- RICHARD: Ma'am?

25:04.998 --> 25:06.081
- Yeah?
- I've got Dan.

25:06.132 --> 25:08.167
Oh, Dan. Hey, Dan.

25:08.169 --> 25:10.552
Ma'am... uh, yes,
the Maddox statement.

25:10.587 --> 25:12.671
I know, POTUS is about
to make a statement.

25:12.722 --> 25:14.423
- Ben just told me.
- Oh.

25:14.474 --> 25:16.508
Well, did he tell you that it was
because a lot of people saw a post

25:16.559 --> 25:20.229
- that Jonah made that I forwarded?
- What? You did this?

25:20.313 --> 25:23.015
Well, I don't like
to toot my own horn, but...

25:23.066 --> 25:25.818
(mimics trumpet fanfare)
...yes, yes, I did.

25:25.852 --> 25:28.187
And just like that,
Jonah is gone, forever.

25:28.189 --> 25:30.355
Well, all my orgasms
have come at once.

25:30.357 --> 25:33.692
- That's fantastic.
- SELINA: Yeah, yeah.

25:33.694 --> 25:35.194
Now, listen, ma'am,
I wanted to ask you...

25:35.245 --> 25:38.030
- Yeah?
- Would you do me the honor

25:38.032 --> 25:40.499
of making me your campaign manager?

25:40.533 --> 25:43.202
Oh, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Dan.

25:43.253 --> 25:44.870
(Stammers)
Oop, agh...!

25:44.872 --> 25:47.256
All right, Richard,

25:47.290 --> 25:49.258
listen. I want to tell you...

25:49.292 --> 25:51.877
No... Thank you, ma'am.

25:51.879 --> 25:54.379
Until tomorrow.

25:54.430 --> 25:55.681
What? Tomorrow...?

25:55.715 --> 25:57.216
Book tour, day six.

25:57.267 --> 25:59.184
Cedar Rapids, here we come.

25:59.219 --> 26:01.136
Oh, Jesus Christ. I hate politics.

26:01.187 --> 26:03.722
__

26:03.723 --> 26:05.953
(Music playing)

26:12.232 --> 26:14.816
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.
Come here.

26:14.868 --> 26:16.285
- Remember that Jonah guy?
- Jonah?

26:16.319 --> 26:19.571
- Oh, the seven-foot mouth?
- Yeah. Look at this.

26:19.622 --> 26:21.290
What if I give out the Wi-Fi password

26:21.324 --> 26:23.158
out to everybody on
Pennsylvania Avenue, huh?

26:23.209 --> 26:25.994
Are you kidding me? He's gone!

26:26.045 --> 26:28.580
This is the best day of my life!

26:28.582 --> 26:29.631
(Laughs)

26:29.666 --> 26:31.833
- (Music stops)
- (Amy groans)

26:31.885 --> 26:33.468
- GARY: Hey.
- AMY: Come on!

26:33.503 --> 26:35.337
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:35.388 --> 26:38.090
Vice President Selina Meyer!

26:38.092 --> 26:39.925
Whoo! You should be here!

26:39.976 --> 26:42.728
SELINA:
I wanted to say a few words

26:42.762 --> 26:46.765
and speak very frankly.
I was gonna say baldly,

26:46.767 --> 26:49.902
but I know how sensitive
Mike is about his hair.

26:49.936 --> 26:52.354
(Laughing)

26:52.405 --> 26:55.240
We all know how much
Mike loves his boat.

26:55.275 --> 26:56.942
And I'll tell you something.

26:56.944 --> 26:58.744
If he ever chose to fish,

26:58.778 --> 27:02.414
I know that he'd be
able to cast upstream,

27:02.448 --> 27:07.202
to anticipate, and at that
very first bite, reel it in.

27:07.253 --> 27:09.338
'Cause that's the kind
of guy that Mike is.

27:09.372 --> 27:12.624
- Aw.
- Oh, gosh. I'm going to miss him...

27:12.675 --> 27:15.460
um, when he goes on his honeymoon.

27:15.511 --> 27:18.630
So, here's to Mike and Wendy...

27:18.681 --> 27:21.466
"Some New Beginnings...

27:21.517 --> 27:24.553
Their Next American Journey"!
