00:45.957 --> 00:46.450
here!

00:46.483 --> 00:47.250
Stand back!

00:47.283 --> 00:48.516
Frylock: You can't afford no

00:48.549 --> 00:49.216
iPod.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.181
Master Shake: I didn't pay.

00:50.215 --> 00:50.981
They're paying me

00:51.015 --> 00:51.580
to beta test it.

00:51.614 --> 00:52.247
And listen.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.579
It comes with one of them

00:53.613 --> 00:54.712
mexican shakers that

00:54.745 --> 00:56.212
Stevie Nicks used to shake

00:56.245 --> 00:57.544
around -- on the Tusk tour?

00:57.577 --> 00:59.043
Frylock: Uh, Shake, those are

00:59.076 --> 00:59.743
seeds.

00:59.776 --> 01:00.609
Meatwad: What kind of seeds?

01:00.642 --> 01:02.248
"two all-beef patties, special

01:02.281 --> 01:04.013
sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles,

01:04.047 --> 01:05.446
onions on a sesame-seed bun"

01:05.479 --> 01:06.279
seeds?

01:06.312 --> 01:07.278
Frylock: No.

01:07.311 --> 01:08.378
They're pod seeds.

01:08.411 --> 01:09.177
Read this.

01:09.210 --> 01:10.143
Master Shake: Hello?!

01:10.177 --> 01:11.009
This is an iPod.

01:11.042 --> 01:11.609
Frylock: No.

01:11.643 --> 01:12.542
It says "iamapod."

01:12.575 --> 01:14.074
And it's from...

01:14.107 --> 01:16.273
Donald Sutherland Industries.

01:16.306 --> 01:17.273
Directions.

01:17.306 --> 01:18.972
Enjoy new best friend."

01:19.005 --> 01:20.171
Master Shake: Damn it!

01:20.204 --> 01:21.537
The last thing I need is a new

01:21.570 --> 01:22.170
friend.

01:22.203 --> 01:23.336
I have a hard-enough time

01:23.369 --> 01:24.635
avoiding all the ones I have

01:24.668 --> 01:26.101
now.

01:26.135 --> 01:28.233
Meatwad: I would have eaten

01:28.266 --> 01:29.199
the seeds.

01:29.233 --> 01:30.332
Master Shake: If I ain't

01:30.365 --> 01:31.497
having it, then ain't nobody

01:31.531 --> 01:32.397
having it, capiche?

01:32.431 --> 01:34.163
Meatwad: You know, based on

01:34.196 --> 01:35.629
many stories that I love to

01:35.662 --> 01:37.394
read, I think that those seeds

01:37.428 --> 01:38.660
will grow into a magic

01:38.693 --> 01:40.193
beanstalk that lead to a

01:40.227 --> 01:41.126
mystical land.

01:41.159 --> 01:42.358
Master Shake: Where a

01:42.391 --> 01:43.990
flesh-craving giant will climb

01:44.024 --> 01:45.424
down and grind you into bread.

01:45.457 --> 01:46.189
Meatwad: Gracious.

01:46.223 --> 01:47.422
Master Shake: Maybe I'll

01:47.455 --> 01:48.988
slice your face off and wear it

01:49.021 --> 01:49.621
as a mask.

01:49.654 --> 01:50.621
We could do this all day.

01:50.654 --> 01:52.120
Meatwad: What does that mean?

01:52.153 --> 01:53.552
Master Shake: It means you're

01:53.585 --> 01:54.651
very irritating to me.

01:54.684 --> 01:56.317
Meatwad: Frylock, can I get a

01:56.350 --> 01:57.483
second opinion from you?

01:57.517 --> 01:58.682
Frylock: No, Meatwad.

01:58.716 --> 02:00.148
A flesh-craving giant ain't

02:00.181 --> 02:01.454
gonna climb down no beanstalk

02:01.487 --> 02:02.954
and make you into bread, okay?

02:02.987 --> 02:04.419
Meatwad: Good, 'cause that's

02:04.453 --> 02:05.252
scary, y'all.

02:08.017 --> 02:09.515
What's up?

02:09.550 --> 02:11.082
Master Shake: The sky.

02:11.749 --> 02:12.414
Frylock: Who was that?

02:12.448 --> 02:13.514
Master Shake: Oh, it was just

02:13.547 --> 02:14.413
some Jehovah's Witness.

02:15.013 --> 02:15.612
turn out the lights.

02:15.646 --> 02:16.312
We're not here.

02:16.346 --> 02:17.211
Meatwad: I'll get it.

02:17.245 --> 02:18.111
Master Shake: Don't

02:18.144 --> 02:19.043
answer it -- Meatwad, no!

02:19.077 --> 02:19.677
Meatwad: Hello.

02:19.710 --> 02:20.642
What's up? The sky.

02:21.643 --> 02:22.375
he got me.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.074
Meatwad: Yeah, he did, but,

02:24.107 --> 02:25.141
uh, we ain't here.

02:25.174 --> 02:26.573
Your friend's very funny.

02:26.606 --> 02:28.239
Master Shake: Yes, it's

02:28.272 --> 02:29.638
clearly for me, Meatwad.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.403
Hi. Yeah, I'm pretty clever.

02:31.437 --> 02:32.703
Always sort of get the party

02:32.737 --> 02:33.269
going.

02:33.302 --> 02:34.069
I like you.

02:34.102 --> 02:35.468
Master Shake: Well, I am very

02:35.501 --> 02:36.168
likeable.

02:36.201 --> 02:37.400
Anybody will tell you that --

02:37.434 --> 02:38.699
anybody better tell you that.

02:38.733 --> 02:39.533
Right, Meatwad?

02:39.566 --> 02:41.098
Meatwad: Well, I don't know,

02:41.132 --> 02:41.764
man.

02:41.797 --> 02:42.631
Sometimes you can get pretty

02:42.664 --> 02:43.396
cranky -- ow.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.596
Master Shake: He had to go.

02:44.630 --> 02:45.562
He had a thing to do.

02:45.595 --> 02:46.362
He's just a pet.

02:46.395 --> 02:47.694
I like you a lot.

02:47.728 --> 02:49.693
There's something about you I'd

02:49.727 --> 02:50.992
like to become.

02:51.026 --> 02:52.658
Part of me, you know?

02:52.691 --> 02:54.657
Yeah, I like you a lot.

02:54.690 --> 02:56.056
Master Shake: You got good

02:56.089 --> 02:56.623
taste.

02:56.656 --> 02:57.422
I really thought we had

02:57.455 --> 02:58.622
something brewing back there.

02:58.655 --> 03:00.121
Oh, I have something brewing.

03:00.154 --> 03:01.593
Uhh!

03:01.626 --> 03:02.992
Master Shake: Hey, let's hang

03:03.025 --> 03:03.492
out.

03:03.525 --> 03:04.192
Do you have time?

03:04.225 --> 03:06.058
I have all day, all night,

03:06.090 --> 03:07.657
all tomorrow, all tomorrow

03:07.690 --> 03:09.356
night, all the next day, and

03:09.389 --> 03:11.221
nights and days and nights after

03:11.255 --> 03:11.920
that.

03:11.954 --> 03:12.920
Master Shake: That's great.

03:12.954 --> 03:13.919
Frylock, will you check my

03:13.953 --> 03:14.486
schedule, please,

03:14.519 --> 03:15.318
right on the fridge?

03:15.352 --> 03:16.917
Frylock: "24-7, the thunder

03:16.951 --> 03:17.584
will roll."

03:17.617 --> 03:18.950
Looks like you're all booked

03:18.983 --> 03:19.650
up -- forever.

03:19.683 --> 03:21.115
Master Shake: Can you push

03:21.149 --> 03:22.348
the rolling thunder to next

03:22.381 --> 03:22.981
week?

03:23.014 --> 03:24.047
You have time for a drink?

03:24.080 --> 03:25.280
Me -- I have all the time.

03:25.313 --> 03:26.479
Master Shake: Okay, but,

03:26.512 --> 03:27.545
also, do you have money,

03:27.578 --> 03:28.877
transportation, and I.D.?

03:28.910 --> 03:30.310
Well, I produce a cheesy,

03:30.344 --> 03:32.109
sebaceous residue with my gullet

03:32.143 --> 03:32.775
gland.

03:32.808 --> 03:34.108
The smell, while horrifying,

03:34.141 --> 03:35.241
arouses me immensely.

03:35.274 --> 03:36.440
Master Shake: Cool.

03:36.473 --> 03:37.606
So you're a musician.

03:37.639 --> 03:39.139
I'll see you jerks later.

03:39.172 --> 03:40.671
Frylock: I did some research

03:40.704 --> 03:42.437
on Donald Sutherland Industries.

03:42.470 --> 03:44.202
His company was seized by the

03:44.236 --> 03:45.668
U.S. Military for splicing

03:45.701 --> 03:47.567
martian-plant dna into the human

03:47.600 --> 03:49.199
genome without a license.

03:49.233 --> 03:50.565
Meatwad: Oh, well, there's

03:50.598 --> 03:51.931
the government for you.

03:51.964 --> 03:53.396
I know you said he's getting in

03:53.430 --> 03:54.996
trouble and all, but he seemed

03:55.030 --> 03:56.129
like a nice guy to me.

03:56.162 --> 03:57.061
Frylock: Who?

03:57.094 --> 03:58.128
That pod-plant dude?

03:58.161 --> 03:59.427
Meatwad: Well, look, I ain't

03:59.460 --> 04:00.659
no good judge of character or

04:00.692 --> 04:02.032
nothing, but, yeah, he seemed

04:02.066 --> 04:03.398
like he's someone I'd like to

04:03.431 --> 04:04.330
have a beer with.

04:04.364 --> 04:05.996
Frylock: Pods, Meatwad! Pods!

04:06.029 --> 04:06.963
Don't you get it?

04:06.996 --> 04:08.295
Donald Sutherland was in a lot

04:08.328 --> 04:09.494
of movies involving alien

04:09.527 --> 04:10.926
pods -- pods that replicate

04:10.960 --> 04:11.626
people.

04:11.660 --> 04:12.992
Meatwad: See, this is why I

04:13.025 --> 04:14.524
don't like to talk politics with

04:14.558 --> 04:16.190
you, 'cause we always end up in

04:16.223 --> 04:16.890
a fight.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.156
Frylock: Will you use your

04:18.189 --> 04:18.856
head?

04:18.889 --> 04:20.088
Meatwad: Look, I believe your

04:20.120 --> 04:21.420
way, and you believe your way.

04:21.454 --> 04:22.254
We both right.

04:22.287 --> 04:23.419
Frylock: I'm just saying, I

04:23.453 --> 04:24.619
ain't too sure about Shake's new

04:24.653 --> 04:25.285
friend, okay?

04:26.052 --> 04:27.151
Master Shake: Yeah, boy!

04:27.184 --> 04:28.351
Burnin' down the house!

04:29.316 --> 04:30.915
Master Shake: It's a disco

04:30.949 --> 04:31.948
inferno out there.

04:31.981 --> 04:32.648
Oh, wow.

04:32.681 --> 04:34.513
Master Shake: God, I still

04:34.546 --> 04:36.512
can't believe that cab driver

04:36.545 --> 04:38.078
said, "$26, please."

04:38.111 --> 04:39.843
What was he thinking?

04:39.877 --> 04:41.243
Master Shake: And then you

04:41.276 --> 04:42.508
just shot out that liquid.

04:42.542 --> 04:43.275
Yo, now.

04:43.308 --> 04:44.974
Master Shake: And you started

04:45.007 --> 04:46.406
vibrating, and then his whole

04:46.440 --> 04:47.640
face melted into his lap.

04:47.673 --> 04:49.239
That guy totally wasn't

04:49.272 --> 04:50.271
expecting a melt.

04:50.304 --> 04:51.937
Master Shake: I was like,

04:51.970 --> 04:53.002
"here's your $26."

04:53.036 --> 04:54.102
Oh, man. Up top.

04:54.136 --> 04:55.501
Master Shake: Hey. Shh!

04:55.535 --> 04:57.534
Let's hit Meatwad with that

04:57.567 --> 04:59.433
face-melting cream sauce.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.165
Meatwad!

05:00.198 --> 05:02.871
Come out here and challenge me

05:02.904 --> 05:04.070
Frylock: You have any idea

05:04.103 --> 05:04.836
how late it is?

05:04.870 --> 05:06.018
Master Shake: No, I'm sorry,

05:06.051 --> 05:06.535
mom.

05:06.569 --> 05:07.101
Am I grounded?

05:07.134 --> 05:07.834
Yeah, mom.

05:07.868 --> 05:09.016
Master Shake: He's trying to

05:09.049 --> 05:09.533
ground me.

05:09.567 --> 05:10.167
Up top.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.232
Frylock: You're drunk.

05:11.266 --> 05:12.998
Master Shake: Shut your face.

05:13.031 --> 05:14.530
He needs to sleep it off, and

05:14.564 --> 05:16.196
I need to be near him when he

05:16.229 --> 05:17.895
does that, so show me where his

05:17.928 --> 05:19.427
room is, and I'll take care of

05:19.461 --> 05:22.093
that, okay, mom?

05:22.126 --> 05:23.859
Master Shake: When I can

05:23.892 --> 05:25.524
stand, I want to beat your ass

05:25.558 --> 05:26.290
so hard.

05:26.323 --> 05:28.156
Hey, let's get them chicks you

05:28.189 --> 05:29.022
dissolved.

05:29.056 --> 05:30.521
Did you get their numbers,

05:30.555 --> 05:32.020
'cause they were hot?

05:32.054 --> 05:33.187
That was awesome.

05:33.220 --> 05:35.152
You don't take it from anyone.

05:35.185 --> 05:36.218
You're awesome.

05:36.252 --> 05:36.884
Up top.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.084
Master Shake: Air five.

05:38.117 --> 05:39.350
Frylock: Shut up and drink

05:39.383 --> 05:40.083
that coffee.

05:40.116 --> 05:41.482
Mom, you shouldn't give him

05:41.515 --> 05:42.281
that coffee.

05:42.314 --> 05:43.913
That will keep him awake, which

05:43.947 --> 05:44.947
is not in my plans.

05:44.980 --> 05:46.279
We want to get a flesh start

05:46.312 --> 05:46.946
tomorrow.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.078
Frylock: "Flesh" start?

05:48.911 --> 05:49.977
no, no, no, no, no.

05:50.010 --> 05:50.544
I'm sorry.

05:50.577 --> 05:51.543
I meant "fresh."

05:51.576 --> 05:52.908
"fresh" is what I mean when I

05:52.942 --> 05:53.608
refer to "flesh."

05:53.642 --> 05:54.641
Frylock: We weren't talking

05:54.674 --> 05:55.307
about flesh.

05:55.341 --> 05:56.606
So, what exactly is in your

05:56.640 --> 05:57.340
plans, huh?

05:57.373 --> 05:58.339
Okay. Okay, fine.

05:58.372 --> 05:59.505
You want me to lay it out?

05:59.538 --> 06:02.343
I want to consume him and become

06:02.377 --> 06:03.109
him.

06:03.142 --> 06:05.008
'cause he's my bud.

06:05.041 --> 06:05.808
Frylock: Uh-huh.

06:05.841 --> 06:06.508
That's what I thought.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.574
Why can't you get your own damn

06:07.607 --> 06:08.174
thing, man?

06:08.207 --> 06:09.439
Look, he's my friend.

06:09.473 --> 06:11.072
We bonded, man. We're tight.

06:11.105 --> 06:12.371
Frylock: Yeah, on a molecular

06:12.404 --> 06:13.037
level, huh?

06:13.071 --> 06:13.803
Whoa. Whoa.

06:13.836 --> 06:15.335
Hey, hey, where is this coming

06:15.369 --> 06:16.035
from?

06:16.069 --> 06:17.534
Master Shake: Yeah, Frylock!

06:17.568 --> 06:18.933
Where do you get off?

06:18.967 --> 06:20.400
I know his plans, and I think

06:20.433 --> 06:21.166
it's cool.

06:21.199 --> 06:22.266
He wants to be me.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.965
Lots of people struggle with

06:23.998 --> 06:24.664
that.

06:24.697 --> 06:26.129
Everyone wants a piece of the

06:26.163 --> 06:26.796
cup.

06:26.829 --> 06:28.195
Frylock: He's saying he's

06:28.228 --> 06:29.961
going to eat you, then digest

06:29.994 --> 06:31.460
you and take over your body,

06:31.493 --> 06:32.526
shake!

06:32.560 --> 06:34.059
Master Shake: I'm comfortable

06:34.092 --> 06:35.558
with that.

06:41.221 --> 06:42.387
Uhh.

06:42.420 --> 06:43.853
Oh, God, I'm so dehydrated.

06:43.886 --> 06:45.118
Frylock: That was chicken

06:45.152 --> 06:45.818
stock.

06:45.852 --> 06:47.017
Master Shake: I know, but I

06:47.051 --> 06:47.851
drank it fast.

06:47.884 --> 06:49.050
I'm gonna lie down for just a

06:49.083 --> 06:49.550
sec.

06:49.583 --> 06:50.150
Frylock: Nope.

06:50.183 --> 06:50.949
Don't think so.

06:51.515 --> 06:52.248
Master Shake: Ow!

06:52.281 --> 06:53.980
You got to stop mothering me!

06:54.013 --> 06:54.780
Let us be!

06:54.813 --> 06:56.046
Where's the ibuprofen?

06:56.079 --> 06:57.878
Hey, this'll ease your mind.

06:57.911 --> 06:59.210
Just lean back and open up your

06:59.244 --> 06:59.844
mouth.

06:59.877 --> 07:00.916
Frylock: What is that?

07:00.949 --> 07:01.616
Is that a roofie?

07:01.649 --> 07:03.315
Hey, it's just something to

07:03.348 --> 07:04.414
take the edge off.

07:04.447 --> 07:05.081
Relax.

07:05.114 --> 07:06.513
I'm not gonna date-rape him.

07:06.546 --> 07:07.513
Master Shake: You even know

07:07.546 --> 07:08.212
what a roofie is?

07:08.245 --> 07:09.045
Frylock: Fine, man.

07:09.079 --> 07:09.811
Do whatever the hell

07:09.844 --> 07:10.444
you want to.

07:10.478 --> 07:11.111
Get eaten and replicated.

07:11.144 --> 07:11.877
It's a free country.

07:11.910 --> 07:13.043
But when he does replicate your

07:13.077 --> 07:14.076
ass, you ain't living here

07:14.109 --> 07:14.642
no more.

07:14.676 --> 07:15.375
I'll tell you that much.

07:15.408 --> 07:16.541
Uh, well, we never wanted to

07:16.575 --> 07:17.140
live here.

07:17.174 --> 07:18.074
Master Shake: Yeah,

07:18.107 --> 07:18.706
that's right.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.006
We might just chill on the

07:20.039 --> 07:21.305
recliner for just a couple

07:21.338 --> 07:22.837
months till I save up a mad

07:22.871 --> 07:23.404
roll.

07:23.437 --> 07:24.203
And our body hardens.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.370
Master Shake: And our body

07:25.402 --> 07:26.069
hardens.

07:26.102 --> 07:27.134
And we are out of this jig

07:27.168 --> 07:27.834
joint.

07:27.868 --> 07:28.933
Master Shake: Then we're gone

07:28.967 --> 07:29.600
like the wind.

07:29.633 --> 07:30.899
Yes, and it's our plan to

07:30.932 --> 07:32.099
follow Chickenfoot on their

07:32.132 --> 07:32.865
American tour.

07:32.898 --> 07:33.831
Master Shake: Yeah.

07:33.865 --> 07:34.464
And we're -- what?

07:34.497 --> 07:35.564
♪ Chickenfoot ♪

07:35.597 --> 07:36.263
Up top.

07:36.296 --> 07:37.363
Master Shake: I'm not into

07:37.396 --> 07:37.895
that.

07:37.928 --> 07:38.862
Hey, me, neither.

07:38.895 --> 07:40.094
I mean, I just said it. Look.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.160
W-we can do whatever.

07:41.193 --> 07:42.326
It's just a suggestion.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.392
You like white noise?

07:43.425 --> 07:44.958
Yeah!

07:44.991 --> 07:46.024
White noise.

07:46.058 --> 07:47.490
Master Shake: Dolphins is

07:47.523 --> 07:48.522
what relaxes me.

07:48.556 --> 07:50.088
Have you not read by bio?

07:50.121 --> 07:52.087
Damn it. Get it together.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.853
You want a brosage?

07:56.917 --> 07:59.250
uhh!

07:59.283 --> 08:00.822
Master Shake: Please, just

08:00.855 --> 08:01.522
stop humming.

08:01.555 --> 08:02.854
Are you trying to relax me or

08:02.888 --> 08:04.220
make me the most annoyed person

08:04.253 --> 08:04.987
in the world?

08:05.020 --> 08:06.119
Okay, you know what?

08:06.152 --> 08:07.319
I don't know if this is working.

08:07.352 --> 08:08.418
Maybe I should just replicate

08:08.451 --> 08:09.384
someone else, you know?

08:09.417 --> 08:10.484
Master Shake: Fine! Do it!

08:10.517 --> 08:12.483
Be my guest! You'll come back.

08:12.516 --> 08:13.982
They all come back.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.381
Meatwad:

08:19.145 --> 08:20.778
Hey.

08:20.811 --> 08:21.477
Meatwad:

08:21.510 --> 08:23.509
oh. Oh, hey.

08:23.542 --> 08:24.276
What's up, bro?

08:24.309 --> 08:25.341
Meatwad: Oh, nothing, man.

08:25.375 --> 08:26.308
Just dreaming.

08:26.341 --> 08:28.140
I was in this chocolate canyon

08:28.174 --> 08:29.939
with gumdrop ponies, and, for

08:29.973 --> 08:31.372
some reason, my teeth was

08:31.405 --> 08:33.171
falling out and I couldn't eat

08:33.203 --> 08:34.035
the ponies.

08:34.070 --> 08:35.403
It's probably 'cause I feel

08:35.436 --> 08:37.001
impotent to change my current

08:37.034 --> 08:37.933
work situation.

08:37.967 --> 08:38.467
What you doing?

08:38.501 --> 08:39.299
Watching me dream?

08:39.332 --> 08:40.332
So, what's up with you?

08:40.366 --> 08:41.131
What do you like?

08:41.166 --> 08:42.265
What kind of things do you like

08:42.299 --> 08:42.965
to do?

08:42.998 --> 08:43.865
Let's get to know each other.

08:43.898 --> 08:44.897
Would you like a back rub?

08:44.930 --> 08:46.063
You into the band chickenfoot?

08:46.096 --> 08:46.763
Yes? No?

08:46.796 --> 08:47.928
Meatwad: I like the idea of a

08:47.962 --> 08:48.628
back rub.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.961
Don't know about Chickenfoot.

08:49.994 --> 08:50.961
I don't know them.

08:50.994 --> 08:52.426
Well, I don't know if you're

08:52.460 --> 08:53.525
into Michael Anthony.

08:53.559 --> 08:54.791
Dumb question, right?

08:54.824 --> 08:56.358
Just jacking your bass, just

08:56.391 --> 08:57.057
like...

08:57.090 --> 08:58.856
♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa ♪

08:58.889 --> 09:00.155
Meatwad: Burn me a cd.

09:00.188 --> 09:01.361
I'll see what I think.

09:01.395 --> 09:02.994
I think you'll be very into

09:03.027 --> 09:04.859
it -- very shortly.

09:04.893 --> 09:05.958
Oh, yeah.

09:05.992 --> 09:07.991
Frylock: Hell, no.

09:09.890 --> 09:11.289
Carl, I know it's late, but I

09:11.322 --> 09:13.021
really need to borrow your car,

09:13.054 --> 09:13.688
man.

09:13.721 --> 09:14.920
Carl, he does not need to

09:14.953 --> 09:17.286
borrow your car.

09:17.319 --> 09:19.750
Carl believes me.

09:19.784 --> 09:22.316
Chickenfoot? Backstage? In here?

09:22.349 --> 09:23.382
Let's go! Let's go!

09:23.415 --> 09:24.448
Right now! Come on!

09:24.482 --> 09:25.381
Frylock: Hold up, now.

09:25.414 --> 09:26.446
I got us all backstage passes.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.746
Master Shake: What the hell

09:27.780 --> 09:28.445
is Chickenfoot?

09:28.479 --> 09:29.312
You haven't heard "Love's in

09:29.345 --> 09:30.278
Jail, and I Got the Key"?

09:30.311 --> 09:31.178
Master Shake: No.

09:31.211 --> 09:32.210
Dude, it's so decent.

09:32.243 --> 09:34.942
Meatwad: ♪ Love's in jail ♪

09:34.976 --> 09:37.107

09:42.404 --> 09:43.137
The fly let him in?

09:43.171 --> 09:44.036
He's all right.

09:44.070 --> 09:45.403
Apparently he's our biggest fan

09:45.436 --> 09:46.402
in the plant kingdom.

09:46.435 --> 09:47.901
Some kind of meet-and-greet

09:47.934 --> 09:48.468
crap.

09:48.501 --> 09:49.433
He's your boy now, Mike.

Oh, my God, bro.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.366

09:51.399 --> 09:52.332
I am so into you.

09:52.366 --> 09:53.098
O-okay, man.

09:53.131 --> 09:54.098
It's -- it's okay.

09:54.131 --> 09:55.464
It's always great to meet the

09:56.196 --> 09:57.828

09:58.828 --> 09:59.961
Like, you some kind of plant?

09:59.994 --> 10:00.967
Dude, I am way into you.

10:01.001 --> 10:01.966
I know. I know, man.

10:02.000 --> 10:02.666
I heard you.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.865
Hey, man, can you stand still

10:03.899 --> 10:05.064
and, like, fall asleep in front

10:05.098 --> 10:05.764
of me?

10:05.798 --> 10:06.730
Yeah, I guess that's okay.

10:06.763 --> 10:07.863
Hey, satch, check it out.

10:07.897 --> 10:08.929
I'm replicating your bass

10:08.962 --> 10:09.596
player.

10:09.629 --> 10:10.428
Just keep it up above the

10:10.461 --> 10:11.128
belt here.

10:11.161 --> 10:12.827
Hey, joe, smoke, who is this

10:13.360 --> 10:14.293

10:14.326 --> 10:15.159

10:15.193 --> 10:16.658
Oh, this is awesome.

10:16.692 --> 10:18.024
Hey, what's -- what's

10:18.057 --> 10:18.824

10:18.856 --> 10:20.023
Aah!

10:24.753 --> 10:25.253
Come on, y'all.

10:25.287 --> 10:25.886
Show's over.

10:25.919 --> 10:26.786
Master Shake: Wait.

10:26.819 --> 10:27.486
Free edamame.

10:27.519 --> 10:28.418
There's a whole bathtub full of

10:28.451 --> 10:29.051
it in there.

10:29.085 --> 10:33.215
Frylock: Come on.

the chickenfoot show?

10:52.471 --> 10:57.202
Carl:
