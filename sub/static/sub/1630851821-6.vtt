Go ahead, Grandpa.

00:48.515 --> 00:49.449

00:49.816 --> 00:51.284
We're already in the nest.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.526
Maybe he is in the tents.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.061
How many men have you got?

01:01.127 --> 01:05.698

and a few Indians.

01:06.366 --> 01:08.635

Don't let me die, you bastard.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.778
Come on, buddy, let's go.

07:19.205 --> 07:20.973
There's something in the air.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.810
There's something in the air
Let's go!

07:37.924 --> 07:38.858
Let's go.

Let's go up!

08:20.566 --> 08:21.634
Guys, let's go!

08:29.041 --> 08:30.676
Let's go, let's go.

08:52.064 --> 08:53.366
Where is Jackson?

09:01.240 --> 09:02.775
We need to get out of here.

09:03.776 --> 09:06.712
We locked the bastards in
but for how long?

09:21.327 --> 09:22.261
Let's go.

09:24.730 --> 09:25.665
Done.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.115
What happened down there, Rojas?

09:46.018 --> 09:46.953
Answer me.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.724
This is all wrong, man!

09:54.260 --> 09:55.194
I'm fine!

10:01.367 --> 10:03.302
My hands aren't even shaking.

10:03.369 --> 10:05.404
Look at me. Look at me!

10:08.441 --> 10:09.542
Let's go, Pardo.

10:14.213 --> 10:15.214
Let's go, Pardo.

10:16.816 --> 10:18.918
You let them study m
like a corpse.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.703
Come on, Rojas, come on.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.042
We must keep moving.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.182
Rojas?

12:32.084 --> 12:33.018
Let's go.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.366
Let's go.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.546
Hold on to us.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.731
Let's go.

13:21.767 --> 13:22.768
Let's go.

16:12.604 --> 16:14.640
Trash mean
there's a village nearby.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.386
Wait.

16:29.588 --> 16:31.090
Wait. Wait.

17:00.786 --> 17:02.855
We need to mov
before it gets dark.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.666
What are you looking at, Doc?

17:48.767 --> 17:50.069
You looking at me?

17:51.370 --> 17:52.971
I'm just walking.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.278
Why do you guy
keep playing dumb?

17:59.344 --> 18:01.680
I can't go on. I can't go on.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.216
There's too much light.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.652
How is Pardo doing?

18:08.787 --> 18:09.788
Rojas!

18:19.364 --> 18:21.100
They only attack us at night.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.469
We need to get out of her
before dark.

18:24.036 --> 18:25.637
So quit yelling.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.025
I can't continue.

19:20.092 --> 19:23.262
Yes you can, Pardita
We're almost there.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.536
Sit down.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.940
There. Rest a little.

20:04.069 --> 20:05.003
Let's go.

20:58.624 --> 20:59.558
No!

21:00.259 --> 21:02.394
Pardo! No!

21:16.775 --> 21:18.944
Castillo, run, Castillo, run!

21:22.648 --> 21:23.615
Díaz?

21:31.690 --> 21:33.191
I told you so.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.926
Rojas, I told you!

21:34.993 --> 21:35.961
Díaz.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.262
-I told you
-Díaz!

21:39.164 --> 21:40.766
Stop him, Rojas.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.741
Díaz will expose us
He can't run away.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.776
Go!

21:52.144 --> 21:53.745
You stay with Pardo.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.316
Hello.

25:54.419 --> 25:55.720
Where are your parents?

27:57.442 --> 27:58.376
Flor.

28:01.479 --> 28:02.414
Flor!

28:30.608 --> 28:32.243
How many are alive?

29:47.385 --> 29:50.088
Let me go! Let me go!

29:51.122 --> 29:52.557
Let me go!

29:53.224 --> 29:55.693
Let me go! Let me go!

30:20.018 --> 30:21.186
My name is Bob.

30:23.421 --> 30:25.857
I'm the only one left alive.

30:42.907 --> 30:43.875
Two?

30:47.445 --> 30:50.748
So my buddy grabbe
El Mueco's girlfriend's butt.

30:50.815 --> 30:52.317
He got up and...

30:53.952 --> 30:57.288
I'm a peaceful gu
so I didn't get involved.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.657
Then El Mueco went like...

31:00.625 --> 31:04.195
His shirt was covered in blood
I said, "What's wrong, buddy?"

31:05.330 --> 31:07.565
"Uncover your mouth
What happened?"

31:07.932 --> 31:10.501
Four front teeth were missin
and I said,

31:10.568 --> 31:12.770
"Mellizo, buddy, go!"

31:14.906 --> 31:17.876
Straight to the hospital
I filled out the forms,

31:17.942 --> 31:20.478
while the doctor saw hi
and 30 minutes later,

31:20.545 --> 31:22.981
Mellizo sai
they'd fix his teeth

31:23.047 --> 31:24.215
if we found them.

31:24.282 --> 31:26.217
So we went back to the club:

31:26.284 --> 31:30.321
"Lights on, everybody help u
find those teeth."

31:31.055 --> 31:34.893
Chicks in high-heels
and miniskirts, guys in suits,

31:34.959 --> 31:37.128
on all four
looking for the teeth.

31:37.195 --> 31:39.464
Then somebody shouted
"I found them!"

31:40.632 --> 31:43.735
So we put them in a ba
and we went to...

31:45.203 --> 31:46.204
What's wrong?

31:48.606 --> 31:49.607
Nothing.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.076
Aren't you hungry?

31:52.777 --> 31:54.846
-Not really
-Is it your leg?

31:58.316 --> 31:59.384
Your buddies.

32:02.453 --> 32:03.888
What did the colonel say?

32:05.290 --> 32:07.592
-Nothing
-You know those...

32:35.920 --> 32:38.389
Medics! Medics!

32:39.157 --> 32:41.759

36:17.341 --> 36:19.610
-There's an ongoing mission
-Get out!

36:21.345 --> 36:22.480
Don't touch me!

36:25.116 --> 36:27.185

38:09.987 --> 38:12.256
Go! Go! Go!
