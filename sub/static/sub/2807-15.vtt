00:03.545 --> 00:05.212
- Oh! Hey, Rach!
- Hi.

00:05.422 --> 00:07.381
- Happy Valentine's Day!
- You too!

00:07.549 --> 00:10.050
Hey, so, uh, how's it going
living over at Ross'?

00:10.218 --> 00:15.806
It's good, except he makes us watch
the Discovery Channel all day long.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.142
Did you know that something
really boring...

00:18.309 --> 00:21.478
...happened to someone
really ugly in the Middle Ages?

00:22.272 --> 00:23.981
- Thank you. See you guys later.
- Okay.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.691
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.947
That is one lucky
to-go cup of coffee.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.074
Oh, honey.

00:34.284 --> 00:37.995
I wish you'd get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.

00:38.246 --> 00:41.832
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?

00:43.168 --> 00:44.960
Thanks. Maybe later.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.590
- Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
- You want anything?

00:49.758 --> 00:52.051
You know what I want?
I want a lot of things.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.928
I wanna be with the woman I love
on Valentine's Day!

00:55.096 --> 00:57.097
I want her to love me back.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.141
And I want one moment of relief...

00:59.309 --> 01:02.978
...from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing
that's never gonna happen!

01:04.147 --> 01:05.689
We have red bagels.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.943
Okay.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.152
So how does Mona feel about
you and Rachel living together?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.488
I'm on my way to tell her right now.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.491
She's been away all week visiting parents,
but she'll be cool.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.451
She's been so supportive.

01:59.619 --> 02:04.289
She even got the baby a tiny T-shirt
that says, "Fossils are my friends."

02:05.291 --> 02:08.585
Ugh, come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.

02:08.877 --> 02:10.795
- So, uh, I'm gonna take off.
- All right.

02:10.964 --> 02:15.134
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!
Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.137
- What is it?
- A video of my friend giving birth.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.014
- Could you bring it back to your apartment?
- All right.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.600
"Candy and Cookie"?

02:23.768 --> 02:26.937
Yeah, Candy's the mother,
Cookie's the daughter.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.523
The father's name is also Cookie.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.027
Why am I friends with these people?

02:34.988 --> 02:37.948
Phoebe, come here. I wanna show you
something in the bathroom.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.284
Ugh, Monica, grow up.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.788
- What do you got behind your back?
- Nothing.

02:44.956 --> 02:48.208
Just something I want
Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.211
- You don't want my opinion?
- Not really.

02:51.379 --> 02:54.214
Come on, I'm your older brother.
Ask me.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.133
Oh, okay, big brother. Um...

02:56.301 --> 02:59.094
Which one would make
your little sister look hotter...

02:59.262 --> 03:01.763
...so your best friend
would want to do her?

03:07.353 --> 03:09.146
The red one.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.862
- Hey.
- Mm.

03:17.030 --> 03:21.450
I know you've been depressed lately,
so I brought someone to cheer you up.

03:21.618 --> 03:25.329
Right outside this door
is a real, live, furry playmate.

03:25.496 --> 03:28.332
No, I'm not sleeping
with your friend Jane again.

03:31.753 --> 03:35.589
Hee-hee!
- Hey, a dog! Oh, hi!

03:35.757 --> 03:39.259
Who, you gotta admit,
looks a lot like Jane.

03:39.594 --> 03:44.264
This is the happiest dog in the world.
I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.601
So you can keep him until he cheers
you up. And he will cheer you up.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.102
Thanks so much, Pheebs.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.064
We are gonna have so much fun!
Yes we are!

03:52.232 --> 03:54.191
Oh, not that kind of fun.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.825
- Happy Valentine's!
- Hey!

04:03.993 --> 04:05.077
I'll be right out.

04:05.245 --> 04:09.456
I'm slipping into something a little less
comfortable and a little more slutty.

04:13.002 --> 04:21.426
"Candy and Cookie"?

04:21.594 --> 04:24.012
Monica got me porn?

04:25.431 --> 04:28.141
Girl-on-girl porn?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.812
She really must love me!

04:41.489 --> 04:45.867
Yeah, just relax.
- I love you, St. Valentine.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.877
Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.839
- Now push!
- Unh!

04:59.007 --> 05:02.801
Ow! Oh, God, it hurts!

05:03.011 --> 05:05.971
Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!

05:06.848 --> 05:10.726
- Oh, make it stop!
- I am trying!

05:12.937 --> 05:15.272
Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!

05:15.732 --> 05:18.442
You're cute, but you're not too smart.

05:20.111 --> 05:24.823
Yeah. Did I just throw this?

05:26.701 --> 05:27.868
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.330
I accidentally packed these
with my stuff.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.833
- Who is this?
- That's, uh, Phoebe's friend's dog.

05:35.001 --> 05:38.337
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.

05:38.504 --> 05:44.593
Ohh, you are so cute. I wish I could play
with you more, but I've gotta go to work.

05:44.761 --> 05:49.306
I hope I stop talking like this before
my marketing meeting. Yes, I do.

05:50.099 --> 05:53.185
Bye-bye, Joey.
Seriously, I can't stop it.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.065
Come here! Hey!

05:58.274 --> 06:02.778
Hey. That's Rachel.
She's the one who used to live here.

06:02.987 --> 06:06.948
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.202
But we can't have her. No.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.704
I really miss her.

06:13.206 --> 06:17.000
Hey, you understand, right?
You're a guy.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.045
Well, you used to be.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.557
So, what do you think?

06:34.811 --> 06:36.478
I've still got it.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.232
- Why did you get me this?
- What is it?

06:40.441 --> 06:45.278
It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.907
Oh, the dilating!

06:50.076 --> 06:53.161
Is this the video of the baby being born?
This is Phoebe's.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.038
Why were you even watching it?

06:59.544 --> 07:03.713
I thought maybe you got me porn
for Valentine's Day.

07:04.924 --> 07:09.469
Chandler, if you thought I was gonna
get you porn for Valentine's Day...

07:09.679 --> 07:11.638
...you were right.

07:12.723 --> 07:16.893
Apparently, it's about a girl who moves
to the city in search of stardom...

07:17.061 --> 07:19.354
...but ends up having sex
with a lot of guys.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.232
It got four stars.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.860
Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.322
- Anyway, you wanna take a look?
- Well...

07:29.490 --> 07:34.744
- I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
- Hey, what's going on?

07:34.954 --> 07:38.081
Well, remember the first time
you saw Jaws...

07:38.249 --> 07:41.501
...how long it took
to go back in the water?

07:43.963 --> 07:47.132
Chandler, we can't let this tape
wreck Valentine's Day.

07:47.300 --> 07:52.012
- You don't know. You didn't see it.
- Childbirth is a natural thing. It's beautiful.

07:52.221 --> 07:54.764
Oh, beautiful? Really? Huh, really?

07:54.974 --> 07:56.475
You think this is beautiful?

08:01.230 --> 08:05.066
Oh, my God!
No wonder my mother hates me!

08:07.028 --> 08:09.821
- See, honey, there's...
- Don't touch me!

08:12.241 --> 08:14.159
- Hi!
- Hey!

08:14.327 --> 08:15.577
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.163
- So how was Atlantic City?
- Good.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.832
- I brought you back a present.
- What...?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.959
Come on, you didn't have to...

08:23.127 --> 08:26.171
- Saltwater taffy?
- Ha-ha-ha.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.215
- Thanks.
- Mm.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.384
It's interesting, most people think
this is made with seawater.

08:31.552 --> 08:35.472
But it's actually made with,
uh, salted fresh water.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.767
That's not interesting.

08:38.976 --> 08:42.437
- I think it's interesting.
- I do too. I missed you!

08:42.647 --> 08:45.732
- Me too. How was your week?
- Oh, it was good.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.693
- Actually, the baby started kicking.
- How exciting.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.570
Yeah, aw. It was amazing.

08:50.738 --> 08:54.366
The only sad thing is, I wasn't around
when it happened the first time.

08:54.534 --> 08:58.662
- Oh, no.
- I was missing out on all this stuff.

08:58.829 --> 09:03.875
- Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
- Ha, ha. Yeah, right.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.671
- What?
- Joey cracks me up.

09:07.838 --> 09:12.050
"Yeah, have your ex-wife move in.
That wouldn't be awkward at all." Heh.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.846
Huh. Heh.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.057
Hey, imagine, I go away for a few days...

09:19.225 --> 09:22.644
...I come back and my boyfriend is living
with some woman he got pregnant.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.692
So, what'd you tell him?

09:40.454 --> 09:43.290
How could you not tell Mona
that Rachel is living with you?

09:43.457 --> 09:47.085
I don't know. She seemed to think
it was such a crazy idea.

09:47.253 --> 09:51.298
Plus, she, uh... She got me taffy.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.342
- Taffy, really? I've never had any.
- Ever?

09:54.552 --> 09:59.431
My mother was too busy planning her
suicide to provide saltwater treats.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.683
Thank you.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.436
So are you just never gonna tell her?

10:04.645 --> 10:07.147
No, no, I will.
I just want to butter her up first.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.816
I'm gonna take her to an amazing
Valentine's dinner...

10:09.984 --> 10:12.152
...do all this romantic stuff.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.488
And then, when she thinks
I'm the best boyfriend in the world...

10:15.656 --> 10:19.743
...then I tell her my pregnant
ex-girlfriend is living with me.

10:19.952 --> 10:23.747
If I haven't said it before,
she's a lucky, lucky lady.

10:25.958 --> 10:29.919
So where are...? What the
mother of crap is up with this stuff?

10:31.505 --> 10:35.800
God, is it gum? Is it food?
What's the deal?

10:38.137 --> 10:40.555
Oh, it's nice.
May I try a pink one?

10:43.893 --> 10:49.189
So between her and me being friends,
and her history with Ross...

10:49.440 --> 10:51.483
...it just isn't gonna happen.

10:51.734 --> 10:55.987
It'd be like you falling in love
with a cat.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.989
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:58.157 --> 11:04.412
Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh?
How's my favorite dog?

11:05.289 --> 11:06.998
You're subdued.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.002
- Did you give him a beer?
- No.

11:11.462 --> 11:15.173
- Will you excuse us? We need to talk.
- Sure.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.343
Oh, me, right.

11:21.013 --> 11:24.891
- He's miserable. What happened to him?
- Nothing.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.477
- We just talked about stuff.
- What stuff?

11:28.354 --> 11:30.146
Rachel stuff.

11:30.731 --> 11:36.152
Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!
This is the happiest dog in the world.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.822
He spends a day with you,
and look at him.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.534
He's breathing.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.121
- I'll take him back to Wendy's.
- No, no, no. He's fine.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.372
Hey, look. Look.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.124
Here's your ball! Get the ball!

11:49.291 --> 11:52.961
Get your ball! Get your ball!
Get your ball!

11:53.129 --> 11:57.215
Get... God, what have I done to you?
Huh?

11:57.383 --> 12:00.927
I broke the dog, Pheebs!
I broke the dog!

12:03.347 --> 12:07.392
I'm, uh, going to pick up Mona.
What you got going on tonight?

12:07.643 --> 12:10.061
Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans.

12:10.312 --> 12:14.566
I've got Chinese food on the way,
and the rest of your saltwater taffy.

12:15.025 --> 12:19.070
It's interesting. Most people think that's
made with seawater, when in fact...

12:19.238 --> 12:21.781
Ross, we actually watched
the documentary together.

12:24.201 --> 12:26.911
Oh, my Chinese food.
I'll get my cash.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.752
Mona?

12:33.961 --> 12:36.421
- What are...? Hi!
- Hi.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.383
What are you doing here?
I'm supposed to pick you up.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.429
Change of plans, I made you
a Valentine's dinner. Surprise!

12:47.933 --> 12:52.312
- Oh! Hey, Mona!
- Hi... Hi, Rachel.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.606
What's she doing here?

12:54.982 --> 12:57.192
I have no idea.

12:58.152 --> 13:01.488
I'll be watching TV
if anybody needs me.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.573
Seriously, what is she doing?

13:03.783 --> 13:07.160
Uh, you know, lately she just likes
hanging out here.

13:07.411 --> 13:10.705
- Why?
- I think she's lonely.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.500
- But it's Valentine's Day.
- I know.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.834
Can't we ask her to go?

13:15.085 --> 13:18.379
Well, no, she's way too emotional.

13:18.631 --> 13:22.008
And by emotional, I mean crazy!

13:24.887 --> 13:27.555
I'm not here!
That's just my Chinese food.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.766
Oh, my God,
she has food delivered here?

13:29.975 --> 13:34.771
Mm-hm, yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.943
You know what? I'm gonna
get in my sweats and eat this in bed.

13:43.739 --> 13:47.700
And you thought
she was gonna be in our way!

13:48.244 --> 13:52.789
Okay, why don't you, uh, open
the champagne, and I will be right back.

13:52.957 --> 13:56.459
- I've got a surprise for you.
- You got another ex-wife back there?

13:56.627 --> 14:00.630
Ho, oh! Heh. Please start drinking.

14:05.719 --> 14:09.848
- I'm just gonna grab the phone.
- Oh, Rachel, wait. Hey, um...

14:10.015 --> 14:12.809
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way, but, um...

14:13.060 --> 14:16.437
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, do you need the phone?

14:16.605 --> 14:18.439
No. No.

14:18.649 --> 14:22.235
Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything,
but this is his apartment.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.362
And we gotta have some boundaries.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.240
So why don't you go to your place
and give us some privacy?

14:27.408 --> 14:30.368
But, Mona, I live here.

14:32.580 --> 14:36.291
Happy Valentine's Day!

14:40.546 --> 14:45.133
Or, something to remember me by.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.686
- How long has it been this time?
- Ninety seconds.

14:56.937 --> 15:00.773
That's better. Ninety seconds
is a long time not to think about it.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.693
Except all I did was think about it.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.570
I know. It haunts me.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.822
Up until now, the worst thing I ever saw...

15:07.990 --> 15:11.159
...was my father doing tequila shots
off the naked houseboy.

15:11.869 --> 15:15.997
After this, I would gladly
make that my screen saver.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.874
We have to get past this.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.294
Why don't we get rid of the tape
and pretend it never existed.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.671
- I could do that.
- Okay.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.054
Okay, now all we gotta do
is get rid of this chair.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.224
Come here.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.821
- Oh, thank God!
- Oi.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.949
Come in!

15:51.116 --> 15:54.243
Hi. I'm sorry to barge in
on your Valentine.

15:54.411 --> 15:58.206
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona is dumping Ross.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.750
- Oh, my God.
- Poor Ross.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.090
Oh, great. We have to watch him
do yoga in his underwear...

16:07.257 --> 16:09.384
...but for this he closes the drapes.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.221
Rach, you know that birthing tape
you wanted to see?

16:13.389 --> 16:15.306
Mm-hm.
- It's here.

16:15.474 --> 16:19.602
Oh, and we should warn you before
you watch it. Don't watch it.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.313
Why, you saw it? Is it scary?

16:22.523 --> 16:26.234
Let's just say it's ironic how footage
of someone being born...

16:26.402 --> 16:29.320
...can make you want to kill yourself.

16:30.072 --> 16:34.075
Now, wait, now I'm all freaked out.
You guys will watch it with me?

16:34.284 --> 16:38.913
No, but I will leave a sweater that
smells like me right next to you.

16:39.790 --> 16:43.376
Come on, seriously, you're not gonna
make me watch this alone.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.215
She's right. Of course not.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.592
Honey, get the tape.

16:58.642 --> 17:02.645
This reminds me of a very specific
part of the tape.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.026
Okay. Here we go.

17:08.234 --> 17:09.944
Okay. Ahem.

17:12.071 --> 17:13.740
Oh, my.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.410
All right, baby. One more time.

17:17.618 --> 17:20.954
Why is that baby torturing that woman?

17:21.165 --> 17:24.666
Why have I seen this thing
three times?

17:26.670 --> 17:27.878
It's still beautiful.

17:28.088 --> 17:31.382
- Aah! It's horrible!
- I know, I know!

17:31.550 --> 17:33.718
- I'm so sorry for you!
- Oh, my God!

17:34.511 --> 17:38.681
- You guys! You guys, look!
- What? Did her ass explode?

17:41.185 --> 17:44.312
No, the baby's out. Look. Look.

17:45.981 --> 17:50.151
Look at those little fingers and toes.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.487
And look how happy the mom is now.

17:53.697 --> 17:58.076
- Oh, Rach.
- Screw you! You don't have to do it!

18:02.206 --> 18:03.998
- Hey.
- Hey! What...

18:04.249 --> 18:07.794
- What's up?
- Uh, Mona just dumped me.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.797
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?

18:11.006 --> 18:15.510
With everything going on lately,
I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend.

18:15.677 --> 18:18.346
I didn't tell her
I got Rachel pregnant.

18:18.597 --> 18:23.684
I gave her a key to my apartment
and then had the locks changed.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.438
Then I lied to her about Rachel
moving in with me.

18:27.689 --> 18:32.610
In a way, I judge her for not
breaking up with me sooner.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.780
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.

18:35.948 --> 18:40.535
Yeah. Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?

18:40.744 --> 18:43.621
Joey Tribbiani without a date
on Valentine's Day?

18:43.872 --> 18:47.166
What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
Heh.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.962
- Sort of. Ha, ha.
- Really?

18:51.213 --> 18:53.673
You don't have to seem
so happy about it.

18:53.841 --> 18:58.469
- Sorry. Well, uh, maybe I can help.
- Oh, I...

18:58.679 --> 19:02.056
Whatever it is,
I am sure it has happened to me.

19:03.183 --> 19:07.145
You know, actually,
once I got dumped during sex.

19:12.192 --> 19:16.237
- So anyway, uh, what is it?
- Forget about it. It's no big deal.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.948
- Come on, what is it?
- It's nothing.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.951
Hey, it's me.
Why can't you tell me?

19:24.454 --> 19:28.082
Okay. Uh, sit down. Um...

19:31.920 --> 19:35.715
There's this woman that I like a lot.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.092
But, uh, it can't happen.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.845
She's not a Tribbiani?

19:43.557 --> 19:44.682
No!

19:46.143 --> 19:49.103
So, uh... So is she someone from work?

19:50.647 --> 19:51.689
Yes.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.275
Well, um, does she like you?

19:56.278 --> 19:58.571
Sometimes I think maybe she could.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.407
But it doesn't matter,
I can't do anything about it.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.742
Why not?

20:02.993 --> 20:04.744
It's complicated.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.831
She was with this other guy.
For a long time.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.833
Someone from work too.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.668
And, uh...

20:12.836 --> 20:16.339
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

20:17.216 --> 20:22.428
So, uh, this guy she used to go out with,
is he still in love with her?

20:22.638 --> 20:25.514
- No, I don't think so.
- Okay.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.516
Is he a good guy?

20:29.186 --> 20:31.103
Yeah, he's the best.

20:31.313 --> 20:34.023
- Then talk to him. He might be fine.
- I don't know.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.443
It's worth finding out,
if you really like her.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.278
I do, so much.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.365
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep...

20:42.616 --> 20:46.035
Okay, Joey, you know what?
You have to go for it.

20:46.286 --> 20:51.415
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.085
Here's your warm milk.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.759
I'm gonna put the bourbon
in it at home.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.511
Yeah.

21:03.720 --> 21:08.683
Anyway, seriously,
just talk to the guy, okay?

21:08.850 --> 21:11.310
Let me know how it goes.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.647
It's Rachel.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.868
You're gonna have a baby
and you need to be prepared.

21:28.036 --> 21:32.832
You're gonna make yourself watch
the whole thing. Just do it!

21:35.669 --> 21:39.046
Heh, I came to the big city to become a star.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.926
- I'll do anything to make that happen.
- Anything?

21:44.094 --> 21:48.681
Hmm. Maybe it starts
with how she gets pregnant.
