That Sidney Potter's a good actor,
ain't he, Rodney?

00:53.320 --> 00:56.600
He was marvellous in
<i>Guess Who's Coming t</i><i>o Dinner.</i>

00:56.680 --> 00:58.280
Yeah. Knock-out, Grandad.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.320
Sidney Potter?

01:01.400 --> 01:05.840
Yeah, you know him.
Always plays the black fella.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.680
Sidney Poitier.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.760
-Sidney Potter.
-It's Poitier!

01:11.840 --> 01:15.320
-It's Potter!
-It's bloody Poitier, I tell ya!

01:15.400 --> 01:19.280
-And I'm telling you it's bloody Potter!
-At it again, are you?

01:19.360 --> 01:23.640
Del, how do you pronounce that
bloke's name? Poitier or Potter?

01:23.720 --> 01:28.600
Personally, I pronounce it Harry Belafonte
but please yourselves.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.040
You daft old sod.
It was Harry Belafonte all along!

01:32.800 --> 01:36.760
Well, I wondered why Sidney Potter
kept bursting into song!

01:36.840 --> 01:39.560
I don't like Harry Belafonte.

GROANS
I think I've got something incurable.

01:53.600 --> 01:58.840
Still, never mind, eh?
Rodney, we've a meeting at 12:00.
What are you doing now?

01:58.920 --> 02:00.600
Our accounts.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.520
You're keeping accounts now?

02:04.040 --> 02:10.000
See, Grandad? People said
I was a right dipstick to making
my brother a business partner.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.800
This proves how bloody right they were!

02:13.880 --> 02:16.600
You dozy little twonk, Rodney!

02:16.680 --> 02:18.800
This is prime evidence, ain't it?

02:18.880 --> 02:21.400
The tax man gets hold of that,
they'll put us away for three years!

02:21.600 --> 02:24.320
If a tax-man comes, I'll eat it.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.360
It's the only way
I can keep a check on you.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.120
I'm sure you're cheating me.
I just have to figure out how.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.160
Cheating you?
What's that rumbling noise?

02:33.600 --> 02:34.920
I didn't hear nothing.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.920
-It's just Mum turning in her grave.
-Don't start that again, Del!

02:40.000 --> 02:42.160
It's obvious you're stitching me up.

02:42.240 --> 02:47.360
You have three or four changes of clothes
a day! Me, I've got one suit from
an Almost New shop!

02:47.440 --> 02:49.320
It's embarrassing!

02:49.400 --> 02:53.920
I embarrass you, do I?
You're the one to talk!

02:54.040 --> 02:57.720
You've been nothing but an embarrassment
to me since the moment you was born!

02:57.800 --> 03:02.600
You couldn't be normal and come along
two or three years after me!

03:02.720 --> 03:04.960
You had to wait 13 years!

03:05.040 --> 03:12.000
While the other Mods were having
punch-ups at Southend and going
to Who concerts, I was babysitting!

03:13.720 --> 03:16.440
I had Ostermilk stains on my Ben Shermans!

03:18.280 --> 03:21.600
I used to find rusks in my Hush Puppies!

03:21.680 --> 03:23.720
I couldn't help when I was born.

03:23.800 --> 03:28.880
There you go. Always an excuse, eh?
And what about poor Mum?

03:29.600 --> 03:32.760
She was 39 when she had you.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.840
For the first months of her pregnancy
you were treated as an ulcer!

03:38.200 --> 03:42.120
To this day, I think the original
diagnosis was correct.

03:43.560 --> 03:50.160
Look! Eh, come on.
What sort of bloke do you think
I am? Cheat my own brother?

03:50.760 --> 03:57.160
Come on, Rodney, I told you before,
we split everything
straight down the middle. Sixty-forty.

03:58.920 --> 04:04.920
Yeah, well... Explain this, then.
How do we pay
the light, gas and rent?

04:05.240 --> 04:10.920
Take last week at the auction, right?
We bought a gross of disposable
lighters, a Space Invaders game,

04:11.000 --> 04:15.520
two facial saunas,
five water damages sleeping bags,
and a moon-roof for a Peugeot, right?

04:15.600 --> 04:19.040
We swapped the lot for
a load of one-legged turkeys!

04:19.120 --> 04:23.400
-It was not one-legged turkeys.
They were damaged turkeys!
-With how many legs?

04:24.440 --> 04:27.160
I'm in no mood for trick questions!

04:27.240 --> 04:30.280
-You left out the VAT.
-We don't pay VAT!

04:30.360 --> 04:32.040
But we collect it, don't we?

04:32.120 --> 04:36.280
All right, Rodney, all right!
So we don't pay VAT.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.680
We don't pay income tax
or National Insurance.

04:38.760 --> 04:45.280
On the other hand, we don't claim
dole money, social security,
supplementary benefit, do we? Eh?

04:46.280 --> 04:49.800
The government don't give us nothing,
so we don't give them nothing!

04:51.120 --> 04:55.400
-What're you complaining about?
-I'm 23! I'd like some sort of a career!

04:55.720 --> 04:59.200
You're self-unemployed.
That's a career, innit?

04:59.320 --> 05:02.680
Selling hankies from a suitcase
in Oxford Street? I want something
better than that, Del.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.760
All right. All right.

05:04.840 --> 05:08.720
In future you can do Regent Street.
Come on!

05:08.800 --> 05:11.680
SARCASTICALLY
Cheers.

05:11.760 --> 05:12.880
And it's Poitier.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.920
-Potter.
-It's Poitier!

05:15.000 --> 05:16.040
MOUTHS
Potter.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.440
-Hello, Del!
-Hello, darlin'! All right? Good.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.040
Do you realise?
We've always had something missing.

05:30.120 --> 05:35.000
We were motherless, fatherless...
Now we're flogging one-legged
turkeys from a three-wheeled van!

05:35.480 --> 05:38.200
-Little acorns.
-You got one of them missing as well?

05:38.280 --> 05:40.960
No. Marks and Spencer
started with a barrow.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.880
-At least they had four wheels!
-Give it a rest!

05:44.200 --> 05:46.360
-Morning, Del Boy.
<i>-Bonjour,</i> Joycie!

05:46.520 --> 05:50.160
Two half-pints of low-carbohydrate beer,
thank you.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.280
-In glasses?
-Yes, or it dribbles through your fingers.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.800
I mean in glasses or jugs!

05:57.880 --> 06:02.920
As long as it's served out of your
fair hands, we'd drink it out of
Evonne Goolagong's old tennis boots.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.360
All right?

06:06.720 --> 06:10.440
Charm like laser beams, Rodney.
It knocks 'em bandy.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.680
Yeah. It's your ready wit
and three-wheeled van
that blows their minds.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.840
Yeah. I suppose I am full of the
old belle esprit, really, aren't I?

06:18.040 --> 06:19.640
Actually, I quite like old Joycie.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.600
I know she's a bit of an old dog,
but...

06:23.200 --> 06:29.480
But I like old dogs. You always know
where you are with them.
They never ask if you still respect them.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.480
They'll always lend you a nicker
for petrol.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.200
SIGHS

06:34.320 --> 06:40.000
I like this life, Rodders.
Duckin' and divin'. Wheelin' and dealin'.
It's exciting and unpredictable.

06:41.080 --> 06:44.520
In this game, you can go out with 50 pence
in your pocket...

06:44.600 --> 06:47.040
-And come home skint.
-Exactly.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.640
I'm thinking of getting a job, Del.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.960
Eh? What chance have you got
of getting a job?

06:55.520 --> 07:00.160
Do leave it out! Did you hear that,
Joycie? He's thinking of getting a job!

07:00.240 --> 07:01.960
A job, eh?

07:02.280 --> 07:07.120
I got GCEs and I took a year's course
at the art college in Basingstoke!

07:07.200 --> 07:11.200
I know you took a year's course,
but you got expelled after three weeks!

07:11.280 --> 07:17.360
The Board of Governors inspected
and found you with the biggest
reefer this side of Marrakesh,

07:17.440 --> 07:21.240
-in bed with a Chinese tart!
-She was not a Chinese tart.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.720
Well, Japanese, then.

07:24.200 --> 07:28.400
Supposing you got an interview.
What are you going to say?

07:28.480 --> 07:34.280
"Yes, sir, I've got qualifications.
Two GCEs, an 18-month suspended sentence,

07:34.360 --> 07:36.240
"and I know a good joint
when I puff one."

07:38.760 --> 07:40.560
No, your feet won't touch, bruv!

07:41.240 --> 07:47.200
No, I'm afraid not, Rodney.
At the ripe old age of 23,
you are a social leper.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.880
Society has put you in the darkest
corner of its deepest cellar

07:53.000 --> 07:55.960
to grow moss, be forgotten about.

07:59.720 --> 08:03.960
Still,<i> vive la France,</i>
as they say in Rome!
No need to get depressed!

08:04.560 --> 08:09.800
Me, depressed? Of course not, Del.
I'm on top of the world!
I feel like a born-again eunuch!

08:11.840 --> 08:14.640
I think I'll apply for a mail-order course
with Exit!

08:15.600 --> 08:18.080
That's a good idea! Never say die!

08:21.280 --> 08:24.600
Ah, there he is! Oi! Trigger!
You know my brother, don't you?

08:24.680 --> 08:26.520
'Course I do! How's it going, Dave?

08:27.400 --> 08:31.640
Sorry I'm late. I had to pop round
my sister's to arrange an alibi
for next Thursday.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.560
-Oi, Joycie!
-Del. Del.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.440
-What?
-Why do they call him Trigger?
Does he carry a gun?

08:37.720 --> 08:39.520
No! It's 'cause he looks like a horse.

08:41.920 --> 08:46.760
Listen, me and Trigger have got business
to discuss, know what I mean?

08:46.840 --> 08:49.800
So get the drinks and meet us back here,
all right?

08:49.880 --> 08:53.360
Oh, yes, sir! Anything you say, sir!
Borrow me daughter, sir?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.800
Very clever kid, my brother.

09:00.880 --> 09:06.600
He's got GCEs in Maths and Art.
You got to see him when he writes
a letter, some of the words he uses!

09:06.680 --> 09:09.240
-Long ones?
-Like that, you know, some of them!

09:10.360 --> 09:12.440
-Anyway, what're you selling?
-This.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.720
I got 24 more in the car.

09:15.800 --> 09:19.160
I didn't wrap it up, 'cause parcels
always attract attention.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.560
Best to carry it openly,
then it don't look conspishus.

09:24.280 --> 09:29.560
Yeah... Good thinking, Trig.
Really good. It goes so well
with your sling-back Wellingtons

09:29.640 --> 09:34.080
and your donkey jacket.
You look like an executive hod-carrier.

09:36.080 --> 09:40.000
Rodders, what do you think?
Infra-dig, innit?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.800
It's plastic!

09:42.160 --> 09:45.800
Plastic! It's Old English vinyl!

09:47.880 --> 09:54.560
Combination locks. Dinky handle...
Might be able to shift a few
down the old squash club.

09:54.640 --> 09:58.760
The police are probably looking
for them right now.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.280
Are the police after these, Trig?

10:02.360 --> 10:07.120
-No, Del!
-Then why are you hiding it?

10:07.200 --> 10:09.240
In case they start looking!

10:09.960 --> 10:13.280
-Leave 'em, Del!
-Shh. Shtoom, right?

10:13.360 --> 10:16.240
We're partners!
At least respect my opinion!

10:16.320 --> 10:20.320
I do! I do! How much?

10:20.400 --> 10:23.360
For you, Del Boy, £17 each.

10:25.320 --> 10:30.760
You know what happened
to the real Trigger, don't you?
Roy Rogers had him stuffed!

10:30.840 --> 10:34.760
-All right, then. £14.
-Fourteen? Leave it out!

10:35.840 --> 10:38.320
-Five.
-Twelve.

10:38.520 --> 10:39.840
-Six.
-Ten.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.200
-Nine.
-Eight.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.320
Done!

10:43.920 --> 10:46.160
That's the way to do business, Dave.

10:46.240 --> 10:53.200
-Right. That's 8 times 25 equals £175.
-Two hundred.

10:54.200 --> 10:59.400
-No, no, the calculator says 175.
-But he's got GCEs in Maths and Art.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.040
So? So he can paint by numbers!

11:04.560 --> 11:07.840
This is a calculator,
know what I mean?

11:07.920 --> 11:10.480
You can't argue with a calculator!

11:10.560 --> 11:12.760
-Give it here!
-Rodney.

11:12.840 --> 11:17.280
25 times 8 equals... 200! See?

11:19.080 --> 11:23.000
I must've got my finger
stuck on the button!

11:23.600 --> 11:29.280
-Pianist's fingers, Del.
-Yeah. Look after them. They break easily!

11:35.000 --> 11:39.160
You gotta see 'em to believe 'em, Spiros.
Eh?

11:39.480 --> 11:42.520
I don't know.
Oi, Grandad! Where were they made?

11:43.920 --> 11:48.200
It don't say. There's some Chinese
writing on 'em, though.

11:48.280 --> 11:53.560
Shh! It don't say the maker's name,
Spiros. The best ones never do.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.600
-How's it going?
-That's the 15th.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.320
-Briefcase he's sold?
-Phone call he's made.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.080
Get them while you can, Spiros.
I've only got 25 left.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.640
This is a cheeseburger!
I asked for an emperor burger!

12:10.720 --> 12:15.080
-I couldn't afford an emperor burger.
-He got me a cheeseburger!

12:15.160 --> 12:19.760
-What?
-I asked for an emperor burger
and he brings a cheeseburger!

12:19.840 --> 12:23.520
Hang on, Spiros! What's going on?

12:23.600 --> 12:27.720
I couldn't afford to get him
an emperor burger!

12:27.800 --> 12:31.880
I'm trying to do a deal here!
Now, shut up, will you?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.600
No, no, not you Spiros!

12:34.680 --> 12:39.000
Now, how many briefcases
can I put you down for, eh?

12:39.520 --> 12:43.560
None. Right. All right. See you around.

12:45.080 --> 12:50.400
-I told you to chuck them cases
in the river!
-In the river?

12:50.480 --> 12:54.960
That's our profit you're talking about!
What do you think this is?
A nationalised industry?

12:55.040 --> 12:57.800
He knows I hate cheese!

12:57.880 --> 13:00.320
Shut up about your cheeseburger!

13:00.400 --> 13:06.200
Ah! Dougie Sadler! He owns
the stationer's in the High Street!

13:06.280 --> 13:07.680
I dunno why he bothers!

13:07.760 --> 13:13.080
He's a trier! Your dad always said
Del Boy would reach the top.

13:13.440 --> 13:17.560
There again, he also said that
one day Millwall would win the cup.

13:19.240 --> 13:24.920
Hello, Dougie? Del Boy!
How are you, pal? Good.
Family? Super!

13:25.600 --> 13:28.520
Dougie, look, I'm phoning
about some briefcases.

13:30.520 --> 13:34.840
Yeah? Cor! What a choker!

13:35.560 --> 13:37.880
Twenty five of them nicked from his shop
last week.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.000
Oh, God!

13:40.120 --> 13:44.600
No, no, I'm not trying to sell any!
No, I wanted to buy some!

13:44.680 --> 13:49.080
I've got this contact in the,
em...stock exchange.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.520
By the way, Dougie, old pal...

13:52.040 --> 13:55.920
What were you asking for them?
What d'you mean they were rejects?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.440
Oh, beautiful!
We bought a consignment of rejects.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.480
Shh! What was wrong with them?

14:01.600 --> 14:07.680
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. Yeah.
Yeah. Who'd be daft enough
to nick them, eh?

14:07.760 --> 14:10.640
Who'd be stupid enough to buy 'em?

14:14.800 --> 14:20.000
I'll pop down next week when you've
got some more in. Bye-bye, Doug.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.920
-God's truth.
-All right.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.520
-What's wrong with them?
-Open one.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.080
-What's the combination?
-No sod knows! That's why they're rejects!

14:36.040 --> 14:38.760
There must be a bit of paper with 'em,
giving the combination.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.520
There is! Inside the briefcase!

14:42.520 --> 14:45.280
A cock-up at the factory.

14:45.360 --> 14:51.760
Nice going.
You've bought 25 briefcases that can
only be opened by safe-crackers.

14:52.480 --> 14:56.120
This makes the one-legged turkey deal
look shrewd!

14:56.200 --> 15:02.520
All right! That's the way I'm made!
Take risks! He who dares wins!

15:03.080 --> 15:05.600
The French have a word for people like me!

15:05.680 --> 15:08.040
The English have a few good ones!

15:08.840 --> 15:12.520
I told you not to touch 'em!

15:12.600 --> 15:16.840
-It's nothing to do with you!
-We're partners, ain't we?

15:16.920 --> 15:21.120
Oh... Oh, I see!
The truth's coming out now!

15:21.720 --> 15:27.080
Come on, Del!
How do you see our respective roles
in this partnership?

15:27.720 --> 15:32.240
I see it as a combination of my
business acumen, contacts and money

15:32.320 --> 15:37.320
and your ability to drive
a three-wheeled van! Any objection?

15:37.400 --> 15:44.200
Yes! With my qualifications,
I see myself as a financial advisor!

15:44.280 --> 15:48.600
Financial advisor?<i> Bonjour,</i> Trieste!

15:48.680 --> 15:51.560
You are beautiful, you are, Rodney!

15:51.640 --> 15:57.880
Today, I just about clinched a deal
to buy these briefcases for £175,

15:57.960 --> 16:04.520
when my "advisor" stuck his nose in
and "advised" me to pay £200! Eh?

16:05.200 --> 16:11.400
My advisor then advised me to chuck
the bleedin' lot in the river!

16:11.480 --> 16:16.160
With financial advisors like that,
who needs a bleedin' recession?

16:17.000 --> 16:23.920
What kind of financial advisor
goes out to buy an emperor burger
and comes back with a cheeseburger?

16:24.080 --> 16:27.440
Will you stop going on
about that ruddy cheeseburger?

16:27.960 --> 16:30.680
-Eat it.
-Get off him!

16:30.920 --> 16:35.040
It's against the law to force-feed
a senior citizen! He hates cheese!

16:35.120 --> 16:40.680
-Why'd you buy it?
-It's all I could afford!
You make my life a misery!

16:40.760 --> 16:46.080
What was that
about me making your life a misery?

16:46.160 --> 16:52.240
Yeah. Well... You do, Del,
with your overbearing,
overprotective manner!

17:09.280 --> 17:15.000
Let me remind you, Rodney,
you were a 6-year-old little nipper

17:15.080 --> 17:18.120
when God smiled on Mum
and made her die.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.480
Two months later
Dad left us to fend for ourselves.

17:23.320 --> 17:26.400
It was me that kept us together!

17:26.480 --> 17:31.400
Nothing to do with Grandad,
an out-of-work lamplighter
waiting for gas to make a comeback!

17:34.800 --> 17:39.400
I grafted 19, 20 hours a day
to put groceries on that table!

17:39.480 --> 17:44.280
OK, it wasn't always double-legal
but you ate the finest food going!

17:44.360 --> 17:50.680
What, TV dinners and convenience foods
that were frozen or dehydrated?

17:50.760 --> 17:53.760
If you'd been in charge
of the Last Supper,
it would have been a takeaway!

17:57.480 --> 18:02.640
Well, anything was better
than the salmonella and chips
that Grandad used to knock up!

18:04.640 --> 18:05.920
Del...

18:08.680 --> 18:12.280
Look, don't get me wrong.
I'm grateful.

18:12.360 --> 18:16.400
I don't want your gratitude!
Ungrateful little git!

18:18.560 --> 18:23.760
I dunno... Sometimes I hesitate
to admit you're my brother.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.960
Well, I always say
I'm your social worker!

18:26.880 --> 18:30.880
Would you tell me what it is
that's made your life a misery?

18:31.920 --> 18:37.920
You always treated me like a child.
I was the only sixth-former
who wore short trousers!

18:38.680 --> 18:40.400
Well, I got 'em cheap, didn't I?

18:40.480 --> 18:44.480
I was 15, Del!
I was growing hairs and things!

18:44.560 --> 18:50.480
And you never let me do anything
on my own, do you?

18:50.560 --> 18:53.480
You even had to help me study for my GCEs.

18:53.560 --> 18:58.200
-You passed in two subjects!
-I failed in the other eight!

18:58.480 --> 19:01.520
You embarrass me, that's why
I can never bring women home.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.200
You know some women, do ya?

19:05.280 --> 19:10.200
The only bird I've heard of
is Shanghai Lil at the art college.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.680
Even then, you had to drug her
before you got your leg over!

19:14.120 --> 19:17.680
-No, I didn't!
-Didn't drug her
or didn't get your leg over?

19:19.480 --> 19:25.240
You're suffocating me! I'm leaving!
I'll prove I can survive on my own!

19:26.800 --> 19:27.880
I'm going to the pub.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.440
To prove you can survive on your own?

19:29.520 --> 19:34.360
No! To get legless!
I don't need you no more, Del!

19:35.800 --> 19:37.040
DOOR SLAMS

19:48.760 --> 19:51.040
Del... Er...

19:51.120 --> 19:53.840
I was just...wondering...

19:55.240 --> 19:56.320
Thank you.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.120
He's very much like you, Grandad.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.840
What, dignified in defeat?

20:08.920 --> 20:10.640
No. A ponce!

20:14.880 --> 20:21.240
No, these can't be the ones they're
looking for. I wouldn't do that
to a mate, would I?

20:21.680 --> 20:25.920
Don't you say nothing to him!
You can't trust the Old Bill!

20:26.000 --> 20:30.800
Remember when they planted
six gas cookers in my bedroom?

20:31.200 --> 20:32.640
Yeah...

20:32.720 --> 20:35.160
OK, bye.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.120
FOOTSTEPS

20:37.400 --> 20:38.480
Rodney?

20:38.720 --> 20:41.360
Where was you early this morning?

20:41.440 --> 20:42.840
Trying to flog these!

20:42.920 --> 20:44.480
Did you call Rodney?

20:44.560 --> 20:48.960
No, I let him lie in.
Is he still in bed?

20:49.040 --> 20:52.200
-No. He's gone.
-Gone?

20:52.280 --> 20:55.680
Packed his rucksack and gone.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.640
-Gone where?
-Hong Kong.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.800
Hong Kong? What do you mean?

21:01.880 --> 21:04.160
Hong Kong. It's in China.

21:04.240 --> 21:08.000
I know where it is!
But what's Rodney doing there?

21:08.080 --> 21:11.760
Hitch-hiking to visit that bird
from art college.

21:11.840 --> 21:15.960
Shanghai Lil?
But she's in Basingstoke!

21:16.040 --> 21:21.360
Not now! She got deported
after the drugs trial!

21:22.040 --> 21:23.840
Here, just a minute...

21:23.920 --> 21:27.680
What did you do, say,
or cook to make him go?

21:27.760 --> 21:32.560
It was that row you had!
He's gone to prove himself!

21:33.240 --> 21:39.920
Prove himself. Nah! It's just
one of Rodney's little games! Huh!

21:40.520 --> 21:43.760
He'll never reach Hong Kong.
He has trouble finding Clapham!

21:44.760 --> 21:46.280
He seemed very determined.

21:46.360 --> 21:51.720
-Didn't you do anything?
-Well, yeah!
I made him some sandwiches.

21:52.400 --> 21:56.600
And he took them? Blimey!
This is worse than I thought!

21:57.200 --> 22:00.680
Oh, wait a minute!
He ain't got no money!

22:00.760 --> 22:06.200
He took his post office book.
Can't you go and search for him?

22:06.320 --> 22:10.640
He's been gone for seven hours.
He can't be any further than France.

22:10.720 --> 22:15.280
-Oh, we've got him cornered then.
-Ring up Interpol.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.520
I'd get more joy from Interflora!

22:18.600 --> 22:23.320
He might be in danger! You can
explain to them what Rodney's like!

22:23.400 --> 22:26.040
I don't know French for "pranny"!

22:27.360 --> 22:30.440
Hong Kong! I mean...Hong Kong!

22:31.360 --> 22:33.800
Why didn't he tell me
where he was going?

22:34.680 --> 22:38.680
He could have taken these bleeding
things back with him!

22:40.440 --> 22:43.800
JAZZY MUSIC

22:47.640 --> 22:49.800
NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE

24:12.080 --> 24:16.400
COMPUTER:
<i>A2 F2. Enter. Illegal move.</i>

24:21.440 --> 24:25.640
<i>A2 B2. Enter. Illegal move.</i>

24:26.600 --> 24:29.240
This thing still ain't working!

24:29.320 --> 24:32.320
That's 'cause you're play draughts
on it. It's a talking chess game.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.920
You can't play draughts on it.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.200
Why not?

24:36.280 --> 24:43.200
'Cause it's chess! You've already
blown the microchip twice
huffing the rook and what have you.

24:44.280 --> 24:47.400
It's supposed to have an electronic brain.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.480
It has got one!

24:49.560 --> 24:54.840
But it didn't know it was gonna fall
into the hands of an old duffer
who wanted to play draughts!

24:55.680 --> 25:00.680
But I can't play chess. Why
don't they invent talking draughts?

25:00.760 --> 25:04.360
'Cause you'd probably want to play
bloody Ludo on it!

25:11.160 --> 25:12.480
Del Boy.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.360
Hi, Rodney.

25:14.440 --> 25:18.000
Rodney's back, Del!
Look! He's here!

25:19.280 --> 25:21.200
Are you hungry, Rodney?

25:21.280 --> 25:23.640
Starving!
I haven't eaten for two days!

25:23.720 --> 25:25.120
Shall I cook you something?

25:25.200 --> 25:27.720
No, no! Um...cup of tea, perhaps.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.480
The old place don't change much.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.840
No. Same as ever.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.880
It's really good to be back, Del!

25:52.960 --> 25:57.040
Aren't you overdoing it?
You've only been gone six days.

25:57.120 --> 26:01.240
-It may have been six days, but to
me it seemed more like...
-A week?

26:01.880 --> 26:03.040
Hmm.

26:03.280 --> 26:07.120
How far did you get?

26:07.320 --> 26:09.200
South of France. St Tropez.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.560
-Ohh! Very <i>mal de mer!</i>
-COMPUTER: <i>Problem.</i>

26:12.920 --> 26:16.160
-Very hot.
-What are the birds like?

26:16.240 --> 26:19.120
Oh. Uh...mostly French.

26:19.560 --> 26:23.080
I met one English girl. Veronica.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.400
Her father's a millionaire tax-exile.

26:25.480 --> 26:27.120
Tax-exile!

26:27.200 --> 26:28.800
COMPUTER: <i>Illegal.</i>

26:29.760 --> 26:32.120
Had a boat, had he, in the bay?

26:32.200 --> 26:37.720
A yacht, yeah. They invited me
for dinner. I didn't go, though.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.560
Still had Grandad's sandwiches?

26:41.480 --> 26:46.280
No! No, that night I packed my bags
and headed home.

26:46.360 --> 26:51.560
-I was homesick, see. I...I missed that.
-You're joking.

26:51.640 --> 26:54.400
The only people who ever
missed that are the Luftwaffe.

26:56.280 --> 27:02.320
It may not be much to you, but to me
it's got a raw and savage beauty.
I've got artist's eyes.

27:02.400 --> 27:07.680
Artist's eyes, pianist's fingers,
Italian footballer's legs.
You should get a disability allowance.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.960
I know you'll never understand,

27:12.040 --> 27:16.920
but you've got to suffer paradise
before you realise what you left behind.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.040
Your home, your family...

27:19.160 --> 27:21.280
-Your passport.
-Your passport.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.920
You knew! You let me go through
all that! Where did you find it?

27:31.640 --> 27:33.240
Top of your cupboard.

27:33.320 --> 27:39.040
We were expecting the gendarmes,
so I checked your room in case you
had any exotic tobacco lying about.

27:40.440 --> 27:44.800
I knew it was just a moody!
Just one of your little games.

27:44.880 --> 27:48.240
Must be wonderful to always be right.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.720
It is a bit embarrassing at times.

27:51.800 --> 27:57.000
And, Rodney, you said I'd never
get rid of them briefcases.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.920
And you did, didn't you, Del?

27:59.000 --> 28:02.120
Yes! Chucked the bleedin' lot
in the river!

28:03.960 --> 28:07.320
No! You threw 'em in the river?

28:07.400 --> 28:11.640
Yup. They floated.
That was a bit unforeseen.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.240
Probably rounding Tilbury about now.

28:18.120 --> 28:22.800
LAUGHS 200 quid down the Swanee, eh?
Or in this case, the Thames!

28:22.920 --> 28:24.240
DEL SCOFFS

28:24.320 --> 28:29.640
St Tropez. How far did you really get?

28:29.720 --> 28:32.040
The Shangri-La doss house,
Stoke Newington.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.160
Shared a room with some cholera cultures.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.960
COMPUTER: <i>Your move.</i>

28:46.920 --> 28:52.000
Well, what do you fancy? Shall we
go down the pub and act stupid,

28:52.080 --> 28:55.720
or shall we sail across to
Veronica's dad's yacht for tiffin?

28:57.040 --> 29:02.200
Best not go to the yacht.
Might bump into them bloody
briefcases halfway, eh?
