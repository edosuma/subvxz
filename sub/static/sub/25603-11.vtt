00:02.002 --> 00:03.655
-Previously on Wynonna Earp:
-You got your magic gun
ready to go?

00:03.699 --> 00:06.267
-I gave it to my mortal enemy.
-You are the one. The champion.

00:06.310 --> 00:08.051
You are the daughter
of one of two angels

00:08.095 --> 00:10.010
tasked with protecting
the garden: Juan Carlo--

00:10.053 --> 00:13.230
-And Julian.
-The blood eclipse occurs
on this very night.

00:13.274 --> 00:17.626
-There's one happening soon.
Like, tomorrow.
-No-show. Not the face!

00:17.669 --> 00:21.673
-You will save me.
-Yeah, I saved you. Exactly.

00:21.717 --> 00:24.024
!

00:24.067 --> 00:25.460
: I wish I knew.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.289
Being an Earp sucks balls.

00:38.125 --> 00:41.171
-You can barely see the marks.
-Okay. So then
we don't tell Wynonna?

00:41.215 --> 00:42.781
What, that Doc killed him?

00:44.609 --> 00:46.307
God.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.657
There's no way
to tell someone this.

00:49.353 --> 00:53.096
Especially not her and...
definitely not now.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.098
: Sheriff Haught,
what's your 20?

00:55.142 --> 00:57.448
I'm at the station,
Sheriff Nedley.
What do you need?

00:57.492 --> 00:59.711
Things are going
to H-E-triple
hockey sticks out here.

00:59.755 --> 01:00.669
We need more hands.

01:00.712 --> 01:02.540
Okay, yeah, Roger that.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.586
The town evacuation is a lot.

01:05.456 --> 01:08.416
I... I need to think anyway.
-Okay.

01:10.766 --> 01:11.767
Are you sure you're okay?

01:15.597 --> 01:17.642
Yeah, of course.

01:17.686 --> 01:18.817
-Okay.
-Stay safe.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.515
Okay. You too.

01:50.153 --> 01:51.720
Whoa! Oh!

01:53.330 --> 01:55.115
-Hey.
-Hi...

02:04.733 --> 02:07.866
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

02:07.910 --> 02:09.781
♪ I know
that ain't no way to live ♪

02:09.825 --> 02:13.133
♪ I told that devil

02:13.176 --> 02:15.396
♪ To take you back

02:15.439 --> 02:20.357
♪ I told that devil
to take you back ♪♪

02:21.445 --> 02:23.447
Stupid prophetic moon.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.363
Simmer down, it's two o'clock
in the morning.

02:31.281 --> 02:32.500
I tried, Dolls.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.373
You bet on the wrong horse.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.422
And now, there's one
walking through my yard.

02:44.773 --> 02:48.168
Don't stop now. Keep going.
Run for your life.
This is your chance.

02:49.604 --> 02:50.822
Okay, good talk.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.654
Some of us have to figure out
how to save the world.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.530
The old tornado siren?

03:02.573 --> 03:05.533
: Ah! That's it.
We've evacuated the whole town.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.709
:
Except for a few stragglers.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.928
Yeah, well, they all seemed
to leave without much fuss.

03:09.972 --> 03:13.193
Anyone with a brain
in their head wants to run away
from Purgatory, not toward it.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.847
Like wildlife.
Which, by the way,
are also fleeing the Triangle.

03:15.891 --> 03:18.720
I helped a panicked pack
of hedgehogs across the river.

03:18.763 --> 03:21.679
See? And Nedley thought
you were too soft
to be emergency deputy.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.942
-I'm a cop now.
-Okay.

03:23.986 --> 03:27.424
We had an emergency safety vest
and we were desperate,
but we do appreciate the help.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.252
Hey, your dad get out okay?

03:29.296 --> 03:31.776
Yeah, yeah. The Whitlocks
had extra space in their car.

03:31.820 --> 03:35.215
They're driving him as far
as Petersburg at my uncle's.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.781
Was he scared?

03:36.825 --> 03:39.001
Yeah. Yeah, he never leaves
Purgatory.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.352
Is that moon ever gonna set?

03:42.396 --> 03:44.572
I'm worried about what happens
when it does.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.835
Well, keep the faith, Nicole.

03:46.878 --> 03:49.403
Jeremy's been up all night
doing something
with Bulshar's arm.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.318
You really think he can science
his way out of this one?

03:51.361 --> 03:52.536
Oh, he'll die trying.

03:53.537 --> 03:54.756
Hey, whistle heads!

03:57.280 --> 03:58.020
Man...

03:59.848 --> 04:01.806
Haven't seen Purgatory
this empty since Pussy Willows

04:01.850 --> 04:04.548
had a charity car wash
and a shorts shortage.

04:05.288 --> 04:08.813
Hey, can you go check
the buildings on 5th and 6th,
just make sure they're clear?

04:08.857 --> 04:11.860
Do hedgehogs get mad when
you impose on a family meeting?

04:14.341 --> 04:17.735
-Evacuating the town. Smart.
-Yeah. We told them
it was a forest fire.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.563
Nice.

04:19.607 --> 04:22.262
Yelling "Run for your lives,
killer moon"
tends to fill their dipes.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.786
-They don't even know
what's coming.
-Like hell they don't.

04:26.353 --> 04:29.573
-Uh, she was at... the station--

04:29.617 --> 04:33.534
Yeah, I just stopped by.
It's deserted now.
I need to find her. 9-1-1-ish.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.581
What's going on?

04:37.625 --> 04:38.626
No. Who's he?

04:41.455 --> 04:42.847
You don't think
Waves would do it.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.980
I don't think Waverly
would do what?!

04:46.764 --> 04:48.636
-I'll keep you posted, Red.
-Wynonna!

04:52.988 --> 04:56.948
Look, you can't just leave me
with half the story!
We gotta talk about Kevin!

04:56.992 --> 05:01.649
-Why would she take off today
of all days?

05:01.692 --> 05:04.434
Penny? Here, love!

05:04.478 --> 05:06.915
Because our dog
totally wandered into the bar.

05:06.958 --> 05:10.484
Huh! Looting? Well, I never.

05:12.529 --> 05:15.315
-We can't just leave her behind.

05:16.490 --> 05:19.362
Classic Purgatory panic.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.408
Lemme guess:
monsters on the loose?

05:24.411 --> 05:25.499
Penny?

05:25.542 --> 05:26.630
Here, love!

05:26.674 --> 05:29.329
Yes, loves. Here.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.771
Waverly Earp, get up!

05:36.814 --> 05:38.599
-Hi.
-Don't hi me!

05:38.642 --> 05:40.078
Stand right now!

05:40.122 --> 05:42.690
!

05:42.733 --> 05:46.650
I don't... I don't know.
I guess I just wanted
to see the stairs.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.086
Well, so would I.
Where are they?

05:53.396 --> 05:54.658
You promised me
you wouldn't do this.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.448
You know, I...
I didn't quite believe her.

06:02.536 --> 06:05.365
Kevin. But then something else
happened with...

06:06.453 --> 06:07.715
...with me and the ring.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.847
More face Face

06:09.891 --> 06:13.111
I raised someone from the dead.
I'm here to save humanity.

06:13.155 --> 06:16.376
Oh, Jesu... You know what?

06:16.419 --> 06:17.899
That is my purpose.
If you're not gonna let me

06:17.942 --> 06:20.031
climb those stairs, then
I'm gonna have to make you.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.947
-Yeah. This is bigger than you.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.908
I'll tell you
what's bigger than you. Me.

06:26.951 --> 06:27.996
Ah!!

06:28.692 --> 06:30.477
Oh... shit.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.393
Sorry, Waves.

06:33.436 --> 06:38.006
But it's like Daddy used to say:
This hurts you more
than it hurts me.

06:47.624 --> 06:51.672
!
-Yeah, she's safe. For now.
-You knocked her unconscious!

06:51.715 --> 06:54.414
She didn't even know
how she got to the stairs.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.546
But the look on her face
when I found her there...

06:56.590 --> 06:58.896
-We can't keep her prisoner.
-Or trust her.

06:58.940 --> 07:01.029
Please, Nicole,
just until this is over.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.553
-I mean, we can't
take the chance. Right?
-No.

07:03.597 --> 07:06.469
-Especially if it risks
losing her.
-Exactly.

07:06.513 --> 07:09.429
So that's why you need
to drive her somewhere safe,
out of the Ghost River Triangle.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.474
I am the sheriff in a town
under siege!

07:11.518 --> 07:14.434
I can't just road-trip my honey
down to Austin for tacos!

07:14.477 --> 07:17.480
Besides, I would be terrible
at keeping Waverly anywhere.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.960
She could convince me
to do anything.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.788
Get a blazing phoenix tattoo
all up your butt?

07:22.572 --> 07:24.574
Yeah, if that's what she really
wanted in her beautiful heart.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.011
One way or another,
I have to take on Bulshar.

07:27.055 --> 07:30.972
Here. I can't just zip off
with Waves on the back
of my murdercycle.

07:31.929 --> 07:32.887
Oh...

07:35.193 --> 07:36.107
Hey.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.763
-Charlie.
-Hey.

07:39.807 --> 07:40.982
Got no shoes there, Chuck.

07:43.811 --> 07:46.770
Well, it's almost spring.
I just want to feel the asphalt
between my toes.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.729
You... you were... you...

07:52.820 --> 07:55.126
That's Ch... Charl...

07:55.170 --> 07:57.868
What's with the stuttering?
There's no way
it's due to "Charlie."

07:57.912 --> 07:59.957
Hey, come on, Wynonna.
You already dumped me

08:00.001 --> 08:01.698
even after I got all the gunk
out of your lawnmower.

08:01.742 --> 08:04.571
-Not a euphemism. It's not.
-Yeah.

08:04.614 --> 08:06.486
I just want to know
if I can help?

08:06.529 --> 08:08.662
What if Chief Me
had an assignment for you?

08:08.705 --> 08:11.795
-It's not likely.
-It's not just for her. It's...

08:11.839 --> 08:15.495
Ahem. It's for me.
And it's for Waverly.

08:15.538 --> 08:18.498
For Waverly? Yeah, okay.

08:20.543 --> 08:21.849
Oh, I gotta take care of that.

08:21.892 --> 08:24.155
Can you tell Waverly that I--

08:24.199 --> 08:27.028
-Flaming-phoenix butt tattoo.
-Sure.
-On it.

08:29.900 --> 08:34.165
Okay, listen. All you have to do
is get her out of town.
Anywhere you want.

08:34.209 --> 08:35.906
As long as the Ghost River
Triangle's in your rearview
mirror

08:35.950 --> 08:38.648
by the time you get there.
-Okay, got it.
-Okay.

08:38.692 --> 08:41.564
And, listen, I know
you're not doing this for me,

08:41.608 --> 08:44.262
but could you maybe apologize
when she comes to?

08:44.306 --> 08:45.655
Yeah. For what?

08:46.874 --> 08:51.531
:
What the fuck Wynonna?! No!!

08:51.574 --> 08:54.011
Well, look at that,
she's awake.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.274
Doc?

08:57.754 --> 08:59.147
Henry?

08:59.190 --> 09:00.714
Hello, Countessa.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.238
I thought you were ill.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.979
You don't look it.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.328
Well, does heartsick count?

09:07.590 --> 09:09.853
Your text said
it was an emergency.

09:10.637 --> 09:11.899
It sure felt like one.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.773
You left me.

09:16.817 --> 09:18.949
You're in love
with someone else.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.213
Who will not love
what I have become.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.564
You became "this" for her.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.130
Or what I have done.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.480
What's that?

09:28.524 --> 09:32.746
I do not want
to talk about her anymore.

09:32.789 --> 09:35.270
I want... to eat.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.751
Tabitha

09:41.755 --> 09:44.801
Oh, my God, Tabs, look at her.

09:44.845 --> 09:48.239
She's the beautifulest.
I need her.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.720
Oh, no.
Don't... don't do that.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.723
You've learned to glamour.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.856
I've taught them
some sweet tricks.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.685
And some less-sweet ones.

10:00.121 --> 10:04.604
The reluctant vampire
has well and truly
changed his mind.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.257
Where'd all the boring
moral qualms go?

10:07.911 --> 10:11.001
You wanted this.
You made this.

10:11.045 --> 10:14.309
Oh... now you're scary.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.878
This is what you love.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.190
Well

10:26.234 --> 10:27.409
We like us.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.106
And him.

10:30.238 --> 10:33.328
So... won't you come play?

10:40.422 --> 10:42.642
Oh, Henry.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.078
You'll be the death of me.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.383
Until then...

10:46.863 --> 10:48.735
...let us truly live.

10:55.916 --> 10:59.006
Oh, my goodness.

11:00.137 --> 11:00.877
Oh!

11:04.838 --> 11:08.798
Bobo! Jesus! What the hell
are you doing here?

11:08.842 --> 11:11.279
Hey. Never mind.
The keys are in the drawer.

11:15.979 --> 11:19.243
Thanks, cockmonkey.
This'll make it easier
to get all the goodies.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.245
Cop guns are the best guns.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.291
Sure. Yeah, yeah, take
'em all. Alright?

11:23.334 --> 11:26.033
Just open the goddamn door,
okay?

11:28.992 --> 11:32.256
Hui. Hui. Hey!

11:32.300 --> 11:33.867
Open the door, alright?

11:36.478 --> 11:39.742
No, no, no, no, no.
Listen to me.

11:39.786 --> 11:43.267
How am I in a cell
if I'm on the mortals'
side, huh?

11:45.356 --> 11:48.185
What I know
is that you betrayed each

11:48.229 --> 11:52.059
and every last Revenant here
anytime you got a chance.

11:52.102 --> 11:55.758
Let's tie him to the back
of four ATVs
and draw-'n-quarter him.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.416
I'm gonna tell you
something, alright?
Just between us, okay?

12:02.417 --> 12:06.116
The Earp heir...
ain't got her gun no more.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.030
Huh?

12:07.770 --> 12:09.206
-Yeah, yeah.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.731
Bobo don't work for nobody.
Alright, open the door.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.301
He's right. Leave him.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.781
Just open the door, Rolf.

12:18.825 --> 12:22.480
Pretty fitting end for a dog
who's lived past his days.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.093
Sit, Bobo, sit.

12:31.272 --> 12:34.014
Open the door, Rolf.
Rolf, open the door!

12:34.057 --> 12:35.842
Open the door!

12:35.885 --> 12:38.758
Let me outta here!! Rolf!!

12:39.976 --> 12:42.326
Wynonna said she's gonna try
to build an arsenal
while we wait for the end.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.851
-Whatever she can find.

12:44.894 --> 12:48.071
-She said I can take you
anywhere outside the triangle.
Tahiti

12:48.115 --> 12:51.248
-I've never been anywhere
that exotic.
-Yeah, me neither.

12:51.292 --> 12:54.121
Guessing you and I won't get
too far on our Air Miles.

12:54.164 --> 12:58.778
Probably not the best time
for a gap

12:58.821 --> 13:02.520
Wynonna told you about me
going into the garden, right?

13:04.131 --> 13:04.958
Yeah.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.309
She said this is
a big-sisterly precaution.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.920
She said you promised
not to do anything dumb.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.095
I lied.

13:14.271 --> 13:17.144
I... need to climb those stairs.
This hunger to help,
I know it's what I'm here for.

13:17.187 --> 13:19.015
It's my job to keep you away
from that. I promised.

13:24.020 --> 13:27.110
Well, then, you're gonna need
to pull out your Boy Scout
knot knowledge.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.503
What makes you think
I was a Boy Scout?

13:28.546 --> 13:30.461
Your face.
The whole thing, really.

13:30.505 --> 13:32.159
I don't want to tie you up.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.901
And I don't wanna have
to sacrifice myself
to save humanity.

13:35.945 --> 13:39.079
Not until I...
absolutely have to.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.310
Oh, look...

13:54.746 --> 13:57.184
it's the world's worst
Sons of Anarchy cosplayers.

13:58.141 --> 14:01.275
Sorry, fellas, don't have time
to fix your mopeds.

14:01.318 --> 14:04.321
What about... shoot us?

14:04.365 --> 14:06.410
You know,
I'm little busy right now, guys.

14:06.454 --> 14:07.977
Maybe you've heard?

14:08.935 --> 14:13.287
Bulshar's... gonna enslave
the world and murderize us all.

14:13.330 --> 14:17.378
Bobo was telling the truth.
She ain't got Peacemaker.

14:18.509 --> 14:20.642
Bobo. Figures.

14:22.035 --> 14:24.515
Fine, ruin my haul photos.

14:24.559 --> 14:27.475
That ain't your magic gun,
Princess.

14:27.518 --> 14:31.131
No. But it can still pow-wow
your nads off.

14:34.090 --> 14:37.137
Or it would if it came loaded
when you stole it.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.314
We got plans for you,
Wynonna.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.620
Tennis lessons?

14:42.664 --> 14:45.058
Let's just say
we're betting on the winner.

14:45.101 --> 14:48.017
And the winner is a serpent.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.584
You're our fealty.

14:49.627 --> 14:50.585
Our gift.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.413
For Bulshar.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.332
I don't do ringlets!

14:58.375 --> 15:02.205
I haven't done a lady's hair
since my sister's wedding
in '79.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.642
1879.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.601
She was marrying
the man I loved.

15:06.644 --> 15:11.084
Can we dump our emotional
purses out later, Jarvis?
I have actual shit to do!

15:12.041 --> 15:14.435
Holy shit.
Am I back in Bulshar's
abattoir?

15:14.478 --> 15:16.393
Just leave the hair, goddammit!

15:16.437 --> 15:19.919
Bulshar is the snake,
the one who cursed humanity.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.966
Revenants
aren't part of humanity.

15:24.010 --> 15:24.924
You were.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.492
You took care of your sister,
you loved people you weren't
supposed to once.

15:28.536 --> 15:31.278
Aligning with Bulshar
is our only chance for survival.

15:31.321 --> 15:34.585
Really?
Like his zombified slaves?

15:34.629 --> 15:36.196
Does that look like survival
to you?

15:42.550 --> 15:43.943
Think she'll fit into this?

15:45.945 --> 15:48.034
It's creepy how you keep
trying to get ladies
into your dead wife's dress.

15:52.473 --> 15:55.041
How did you know
to come down this driveway?

15:56.303 --> 15:58.044
I don't remember turning
at all.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.742
Just wasn't safe to keep going.

16:02.309 --> 16:05.051
Where did all this fog
come from?

16:05.094 --> 16:07.270
I dunno.
Rolled in out of nowhere.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.403
-Always a good sign.
-Yeah.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.145
My mom's greenhouse.

16:13.363 --> 16:15.496
Maybe the fog wanted us
to come here.

16:18.238 --> 16:22.982
No gardeners tending this place
for years, but the plants
just... keep on growing.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.723
Yeah,
all they have is instinct.

16:27.116 --> 16:30.641
Anticipation that spring
will come, like it always has.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.992
Pfft. Jeez, that's optimistic.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.431
And we will be too.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.001
Charlie?

16:47.093 --> 16:48.746
Holy shit.

16:48.790 --> 16:49.617
What?

16:52.141 --> 16:53.273
What?

16:53.316 --> 16:54.448
Nothing.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.278
I think I like greenhouses.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.149
But who doesn't, right?

17:00.193 --> 17:02.456
Well, seasonal
allergy sufferers?

17:05.241 --> 17:06.721
Yeah. Naturally.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.552
So, what,
we just hunker down here
till it clears up?

17:11.595 --> 17:13.119
Just till it clears up.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.386
Kate, wake up!

17:20.735 --> 17:25.740
One night with you
and a lady ends up in a filthy
basement doing filthy things.

17:25.783 --> 17:29.048
Actually, there
was no night last night.
We should go.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.962
If Bulshar gets
into that garden,

17:31.006 --> 17:33.617
there will be nowhere to hide
in the entirety of all
the territories.

17:33.661 --> 17:36.577
And your friends?
Are they hiding?

17:36.620 --> 17:38.361
You play too rough.
You broke my toys.

17:38.405 --> 17:42.496
They're not toys,
and your talent
is not to be trifled with.

17:42.539 --> 17:45.412
Their pleasure was as real
as my power.

17:45.455 --> 17:49.198
I coerced nothing from them
they were not gasping to give.

17:49.242 --> 17:53.115
You're awfully pissy for a man
who feasted like a king.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.250
It wasn't enough!

17:58.207 --> 17:59.426
Henry, what is it?

17:59.469 --> 18:02.733
I can smell it.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.605
A... fog is rolling in.

18:06.259 --> 18:09.392
The kind that has a purpose,
like a hand
is coiling it around us.

18:09.436 --> 18:12.178
Or it is bringing us a gift.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.093
I need to taste it again.

18:14.789 --> 18:17.183
You can't still be hungry.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.446
I will find him,

18:19.489 --> 18:21.187
with or without you.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.494
Fine, then.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.845
Since you asked so nicely.

18:41.294 --> 18:42.295
You're sad.

18:44.427 --> 18:47.213
I thought... I thought
my knot work was pretty decent.

18:47.256 --> 18:48.301
No, I mean...

18:49.476 --> 18:51.782
I'm sorry
about you and Wynonna.

18:51.826 --> 18:54.916
Ah, I'm not sure there ever was
much of a me and Wynonna.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.441
-Can we talk
about something else?
-Sure.

18:58.485 --> 19:02.793
What kind of dog is the cutest?

19:02.837 --> 19:04.665
How about you tell me
what you like best
about Sheriff Haught?

19:04.708 --> 19:08.277
-Oh, wow.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.584
Huh. Where to start? Um...

19:11.324 --> 19:15.284
Well, she... she's brave,
and loyal,

19:15.328 --> 19:16.851
and really great in...

19:19.506 --> 19:21.377
...at, uh, being good.

19:23.814 --> 19:27.818
And she likes me when...
when I'm none of those things.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.211
I've seen you in action.

19:30.517 --> 19:31.909
You're pretty good.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.176
-That's a long story.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.961
Well, I think we've got time.
Wheelbarrows of time.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.355
What's your family like?

19:44.400 --> 19:46.228
Okay, uh... honestly?

19:50.450 --> 19:51.538
I dunno.

19:53.017 --> 19:56.238
Doctor said I must've had
a head injury or something.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.414
I just remember walking
into Purgatory.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.503
I was starving.

20:00.547 --> 20:03.550
-God.
-Had no shoes on. And, uh...

20:07.771 --> 20:11.471
The main thing is I'm healthy
as a horse now, sir.
No criminal record.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.560
I've lost a lot of good men,

20:13.603 --> 20:16.563
and Lord knows I could use
a strong guy like yourself.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.304
This is a dangerous job.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.871
It takes...
a certain kind of person.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.657
I'm your man, sir.
All I want to do is help people.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.659
That's the only thing
I remember.
That's all I know for sure.

20:29.706 --> 20:32.405
-Yeah.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.712
All you want to do
is help people.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.018
Yeah, I guess I do.

20:39.586 --> 20:40.543
Huh.

20:48.638 --> 20:51.250
Haven't you heard?
We're evacuating the town.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.729
Whatever it is,
you're gonna have to call
County.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.644
I'm looking
for a friend of yours.

20:54.688 --> 20:57.560
The station's closed,
my guys are gone.

20:57.604 --> 21:00.346
Like I said,
we're evacuating everyone.

21:00.389 --> 21:04.611
Like I said...
I'm looking for Charlie.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.701
-Your master.

21:11.487 --> 21:14.447
Do you know
who you just drew upon?

21:16.492 --> 21:19.060
Sir, if I wanted you dead,

21:19.974 --> 21:21.367
you'd be dead.

21:24.021 --> 21:26.328
Tell my man
what he wants to know.

21:28.896 --> 21:32.552
My phone. It has the...
the dispatch grid for Vehicle 4.

21:35.337 --> 21:38.949
It'll give you the GPS
coordinates... for him.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.736
Nicely done, sir.

21:44.738 --> 21:47.610
: Oh!

21:47.654 --> 21:49.569
Henry, why did you shoot him?!

21:49.612 --> 21:53.355
It's not important, Countessa.
I must go.

21:53.399 --> 21:56.706
!
-Before he goes anywhere.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.492
I need it... so bad.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.320
The blood.

22:01.363 --> 22:04.758
-There's something very
wrong with you.
-Mm.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.325
Whose fault is that?

22:06.368 --> 22:09.632
No, this is new.
It shouldn't be like this!

22:09.676 --> 22:11.460
You'll be fine.

22:11.504 --> 22:14.811
But if I don't drink off him
again, I won't be.

22:15.508 --> 22:16.509
Doc!!

22:18.424 --> 22:20.034
Lord Bulshar.

22:20.077 --> 22:22.384
We are late giving you
our fealty,

22:22.428 --> 22:23.907
but we know
you're gonna like it.

22:25.909 --> 22:29.957
I'm delighted to let you know
that Miss Wynonna Earp
now belongs to you.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.788
Smile, bitch.

22:34.831 --> 22:37.530
So you can see the teeth that
are gonna bite your dick off?

22:41.098 --> 22:44.537
Jasum Crow, Earp,
what the hell is this outfit?

22:44.580 --> 22:47.888
-Mercedes.
-Welcome to the Purgatory
yacht club, bitch.

22:50.107 --> 22:54.460
Is Bulshar torturing you
or controlling
your broke

22:54.503 --> 22:59.029
Neither. Unless you count
an extremely good Manhattan
as mind control.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.509
Are you banging him?

23:00.553 --> 23:03.033
Gross. Ugh. No.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.600
I'm just his lady-friend.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.994
That's one of the good things
about this arrangement.

23:07.037 --> 23:10.432
There's none of that
me- conqueror/you-spoils-of-war
type shit.

23:10.476 --> 23:13.696
He doesn't even care.
The whole wives thing
is just for show.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.872
Thank God for that...

23:15.916 --> 23:20.399
What you're missing is that
this whole thing is, uh...

23:20.442 --> 23:22.139
an Apocala-tunity.

23:23.750 --> 23:26.840
-No.
-Okay. It's the Titanic.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.668
You're floating on a door
in the middle of the ocean,

23:28.711 --> 23:31.148
you just have to hold
Leonardo Dicaprio's head
underwater

23:31.192 --> 23:33.629
just long enough
to ride it out.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.066
You have lost your shit.

23:36.110 --> 23:40.070
Wynonna, look.
Look at my beautiful,
beautiful face.

23:40.114 --> 23:42.812
-Your skin is like butter.

23:42.856 --> 23:45.728
And I just got it back.
Now what?

23:45.772 --> 23:48.992
I'm supposed to just get it
melted off again
because old Ball-sag over there

23:49.036 --> 23:54.171
just wants to, what,
claim God's abandoned...
backyard?

23:54.911 --> 23:56.870
Nope. Mm-mm. Mm-mm-mm.

23:56.913 --> 23:59.786
No, Mercedes is here
to play ball.

23:59.829 --> 24:04.007
With the demon who cursed
my family? I won't do that.
I keep fighting.

24:04.051 --> 24:07.184
Yeah, we know, sweetie.
Your eye-bags have fighter
written all over them.

24:07.228 --> 24:11.014
Look, the martyr
complex thing isn't
working for you anymore.

24:11.058 --> 24:13.060
-He's got your gun, Wynonna.
-I'm not my gun.

24:13.103 --> 24:17.020
No, you're a stubborn ass
who refuses to get
that she's already lost the war.

24:18.544 --> 24:21.851
Time we started thinking
about just... surviving this.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.115
For Waverly.
For your baby.

24:25.942 --> 24:27.988
I never asked.
Was it a boy, or a girl?

24:29.642 --> 24:31.731
-You're such a coward.
-And your friend.

24:32.601 --> 24:36.213
You know I dig
your whole punch-first-
ask-questions-never vibe.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.781
I even kinda love you.

24:39.565 --> 24:42.698
But I will not let you
get me killed. Again.

24:42.742 --> 24:46.485
And if being a coward's
what it takes to get through
to the end of the world...

24:46.528 --> 24:48.008
then chickenshit me up.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.758
-Thank you, ma'am.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.588
Choke on the olive.

25:06.940 --> 25:10.552
I can touch you again
with the ring, if you want
to remember more.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.989
I've been trying to be cool,
I've been trying to listen,

25:13.033 --> 25:16.123
understand how things go
here in Purgatory, but
I might've just hit my limit.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.603
You have great timing.

25:19.909 --> 25:23.652
I know that fog brought us here
and... and what are those?

25:23.696 --> 25:27.090
Maybe magnolias?
Y'know, I'm not great at botany.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.745
These were not flowering
when we first got here.

25:29.789 --> 25:31.704
These should not be blossoming
at all this far north.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.881
What

25:34.924 --> 25:37.971
-We need to leave.
Why?

25:41.670 --> 25:44.673
I, uh... I know this place,
Waverly.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.196
And I know your ring.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.067
Wh

25:48.503 --> 25:50.853
How is that possible?

25:59.122 --> 26:01.081
-And now we need to hide.

26:01.124 --> 26:02.996
Get up. Let's go.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.086
: Hey, Chief,
you there?

26:08.088 --> 26:11.004
Chief, it's the Sheriff.
There's a rogue alarm
going off downtown.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.094
Do you copy?

26:14.137 --> 26:16.662
-Chief!

26:26.367 --> 26:29.239
Sheriff... it's Kate.

26:29.283 --> 26:30.850
Doc's... friend.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.940
The chief and I...
we need help.

26:35.942 --> 26:38.814
I appreciate...
the hospitality.

26:39.685 --> 26:42.078
What you lack in promptness,

26:42.122 --> 26:45.604
you've nearly made up for
in respect.

26:45.647 --> 26:48.084
Your fealty has been accepted.

26:52.088 --> 26:55.962
Hey, pass me that?
No truffle mash is going into
the compost on my watch.

26:57.311 --> 27:02.751
Allow me... to offer
a plum of my own in return.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.320
In all these months,
my fiercest warrior

27:07.016 --> 27:11.325
was lost in battle
with some local rabble.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.283
Rabble that has since been...

27:14.110 --> 27:15.764
...divided and defeated.

27:17.331 --> 27:20.116
I've decided to offer you
the position of honour.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.424
As I journey...
to my triumph tomorrow...

27:24.773 --> 27:26.645
...I will take one of you...

27:27.820 --> 27:29.909
...as my first lieutenant.

27:31.780 --> 27:32.955
Who is worthy?

27:32.999 --> 27:34.087
I am.

27:36.698 --> 27:40.180
This dinner plan was mine.
So was the offering of the heir.

27:41.007 --> 27:44.924
We should Periscope this.

27:45.751 --> 27:46.752
:
Pick me.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.366
You are not a warrior.

27:52.409 --> 27:53.889
You are fealty.

27:53.933 --> 27:55.195
I'm the Earp heir.

27:55.238 --> 27:58.677
This is the most thrilling
rose ceremony ever.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.462
-Werethe Earp heir.
-I am...

28:02.768 --> 28:04.204
...was a strong opponent.

28:05.858 --> 28:07.207
Stronger than any
of these fainting couches,
and you know it.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.775
It would be ludicrous
to trust you.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.428
I only want one thing.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.781
I've only ever wanted
one thing, Bulshar.

28:17.391 --> 28:18.871
To keep my family safe.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.351
-My sister.
-Ah...

28:21.395 --> 28:23.049
the wee kitten.

28:24.224 --> 28:25.399
The chosen one.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.706
I don't want her chosen.

28:28.881 --> 28:31.318
I'll wipe your ancient ass
for you if it'll keep her safe.

28:31.361 --> 28:34.147
So you can count on me.
Make me the lieutenant.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.806
You think this is a joke?

28:40.849 --> 28:45.027
What else do you want
from my family, Bulshar?
What else do you want from me?

28:45.071 --> 28:47.203
You want fealty? I'll pay.

28:47.247 --> 28:48.727
You want me to beg?

28:50.772 --> 28:53.819
Please. Give me this last chance
to save my family.

28:55.168 --> 28:57.039
I will fight like hell for you.
Please!

28:57.779 --> 29:01.130
Put her in a cell! Now!!!

29:09.269 --> 29:12.228
Hey.
I did not eat his
potatoes. Got it?

29:13.882 --> 29:17.016
What did you mean before
when you said
you knew this place?

29:17.059 --> 29:19.758
-No.

29:20.846 --> 29:21.411
My family?

29:21.455 --> 29:22.935
I'm not doing it.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.029
Promise you'll be back.

29:35.425 --> 29:36.557
My love.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.081
We'll all be together now.

29:42.389 --> 29:44.304
-You're not Charlie.
-Oh...

29:45.131 --> 29:47.350
My mother was...

29:47.394 --> 29:50.266
is... in love with you.

29:50.310 --> 29:51.964
Oh, God.
You and Wynonna...

29:52.007 --> 29:54.444
-No, that's too much.
-Charlie.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.055
I'm not doing that.
That's too much.

29:56.098 --> 30:00.189
Yeah, yeah. Hey, it's okay.
Come here. Stay with me.

30:00.233 --> 30:04.280
Charlie, darling.

30:04.324 --> 30:06.326
Congratulations on surviving.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.415
And that blood of yours...

30:08.458 --> 30:11.897
Oh, I knew you were special,
but still.

30:11.940 --> 30:16.249
Oh, come now, Charlie,
let us not waste time!

30:16.292 --> 30:19.513
We both know
that I will find ya.

30:23.299 --> 30:25.432
He'll kill you. Again.

30:33.919 --> 30:34.876
Hi, Doc.

30:35.616 --> 30:36.443
Ahem.

30:40.882 --> 30:44.146
-Well, Charlie's not here.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.322
Well, his truck is still here.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.150
I stole it. Yeah.

30:48.890 --> 30:51.371
Who doesn't want
to drive a fire

30:51.414 --> 30:53.939
Next time,
I'll grab a Dalmatian too.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.549
You are a sweet...

30:55.592 --> 30:57.377
-little... liar!

31:05.167 --> 31:06.952
And you smell like him.

31:08.257 --> 31:09.606
In your blood.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.175
Angel blood.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.221
You two are the same.

31:15.264 --> 31:18.050
You... and Charlie.

31:19.051 --> 31:20.313
He's not Charlie.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.098
He's Julian.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.144
He's my father.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.543
-Uh, you ruined dessert.

31:33.587 --> 31:37.983
That was the first time
I've seen him, like... scared.

31:38.026 --> 31:39.941
Was he scared?

31:39.985 --> 31:42.161
-I think that's the first time
I've seen youscared.
-I am.

31:44.598 --> 31:46.078
He yanked his hand away.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.037
You think Bulshar
can't touch you?

31:50.952 --> 31:53.476
I think I can't touch him,
or something bad happens.

31:54.303 --> 31:57.393
-To him.
-That's your advantage,
that's what you've got.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.352
What happened
to "chickenshit me up"?

31:59.395 --> 32:01.049
You happened.

32:01.093 --> 32:03.225
You always happen, Wynonna.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.968
There are no Revenants
without the Earps.

32:07.012 --> 32:08.927
I'm cursed because you are.

32:08.970 --> 32:10.493
Bulshar did that...

32:10.537 --> 32:12.452
He did that to all of us,
not me.

32:12.495 --> 32:15.934
But playa played himself,
because if Wynonna
touches him...

32:15.977 --> 32:19.198
-I can kill him.
-Because when you curse someone,

32:19.241 --> 32:21.113
there's a cost to yourself.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.246
A price that has to be paid.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.900
I'm Bulshar's price.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.947
That Snake Daddy didn't count
on Wynonna being this expensive.

32:28.990 --> 32:33.516
-They think you basic,
but you classic Chanel, doll.
-Thank you.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.214
This isn't gonna be easy.

32:36.432 --> 32:40.132
-You've killed a
lot of our kind.
-I get that.

32:40.175 --> 32:43.396
Meanwhile I will make sure
El Creepo is distracted.

32:45.224 --> 32:49.184
-Bro...
The girls wanna watch
this go down too.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.231
Okay, c'mon, c'mon.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.240
♪ I know that talk is cheap
but can you hear me now ♪

33:01.283 --> 33:04.243
♪ I will be living
in the moment ♪

33:04.286 --> 33:07.420
♪ Two feet
I'm walking on the ocean ♪

33:07.463 --> 33:10.597
♪ Got a heart beating
Everything is golden ♪♪

33:11.598 --> 33:14.688
Charlie is your father?

33:14.731 --> 33:15.863
What a joke.

33:15.906 --> 33:18.083
Just more proof
the universe is cruel.

33:18.126 --> 33:21.216
The universe is hilarious.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.654
My best friend's
great-great-granddaughter...

33:25.525 --> 33:29.659
was sleeping
with her baby sister's daddy.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.400
But Wynonna loves you.

33:31.444 --> 33:34.447
Like this? Stop lying!

33:34.490 --> 33:36.231
And you love her too, Doc.

33:37.319 --> 33:38.799
I do not feel love.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.542
Hell, I do not feel anything
at all.

33:44.239 --> 33:46.328
Only hunger.

33:46.372 --> 33:47.416
For him.

33:48.287 --> 33:50.419
-And for you!
-No!!

33:50.463 --> 33:52.639
Why don't you let me leave you
at the hospital?

33:52.682 --> 33:56.077
You think they have
a first-aid kit for vampires
in the ER?

33:56.121 --> 33:58.123
Hospitals are where I go
to snack, sweetie.

34:00.647 --> 34:01.561
Dead.

34:02.649 --> 34:03.476
Dead.

34:05.217 --> 34:07.523
We all end up dead.
Okay, try again.

34:07.567 --> 34:11.440
Well, it looks a lot
better than it did
even half an hour ago.

34:11.484 --> 34:14.748
But it is a gunshot wound, okay?
Not a hang-nail.

34:14.791 --> 34:18.708
This endless day...
I'm regenerating slower.

34:18.752 --> 34:22.060
No darkness to recharge me.
But I will heal.

34:23.235 --> 34:24.497
Dead.

34:24.540 --> 34:25.846
Dead.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.762
Dead. Again.

34:28.805 --> 34:31.547
-You really need to rest.
-I need to find John Henry.

34:31.591 --> 34:33.549
He's beyond the reach of man.

34:33.593 --> 34:37.205
Woman, at this point,
I don't even know why you care.

34:37.249 --> 34:40.600
I made him what he is.
But he drank something.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.819
I don't know what,
but something
he never should have.

34:42.863 --> 34:45.257
Like he fed
on something inhuman?

34:46.606 --> 34:48.695
Stop!!

34:51.785 --> 34:52.829
The angel blood.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.094
-I need to have it.
-It did something to you.

34:56.137 --> 34:59.184
Where... is... he?

34:59.227 --> 35:02.143
-Doc, it's me!
-I will die without it!

35:02.187 --> 35:04.232
Doc, are you in there?!

35:04.276 --> 35:05.190
Doc!

35:06.191 --> 35:07.235
Doc?

35:08.280 --> 35:11.109
No!! Doc!

35:15.200 --> 35:17.376
You'll never forgive
yourself for this, Doc.

35:17.419 --> 35:18.420
Shut up!!

35:21.162 --> 35:22.207
It won't come off.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.211
It will for me.

35:30.824 --> 35:31.912
Oh...

35:32.913 --> 35:34.610
Nice of you to join us, sir.

35:35.307 --> 35:38.614
And the stakes...
they have been doubled,

35:38.658 --> 35:41.791
in the biggest game of all.

35:41.835 --> 35:45.665
-You leave my kin alone.
-I cannot stop!

35:56.284 --> 35:58.460
Oh, my God.

35:59.679 --> 36:04.684
I wandered adrift
outside the boundaries
of the Triangle... for years.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.642
Until a light shined
in the darkness.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.428
It was my daughter,
crosseth over.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.563
-Come, child.

36:14.607 --> 36:16.304
There is no time
for petty humanity,

36:16.348 --> 36:17.827
and even less
for the doings of beasts.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.277
I'm sorry, Doc.

36:34.496 --> 36:36.542
We did love the man you were.

36:47.292 --> 36:47.944
Dead.

36:48.989 --> 36:50.817
Dead.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.775
Wait! Sheriff Haught!

36:54.473 --> 36:57.563
-The cards... are changing.

36:57.606 --> 36:58.912
The Star.

36:59.739 --> 37:00.696
Hope.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.877
You ripped
my dead wife's dress.

37:07.921 --> 37:11.664
Don't be an idiot. Let me go.
Or better yet, come with me.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.536
A dead Bulshar
means a dead curse.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.321
So does a dead heir!

37:16.364 --> 37:18.584
Oh!

37:22.718 --> 37:25.330
It all changes
when Bulshar rises!

37:25.373 --> 37:26.853
Exactly.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.768
So be on the side of right.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.378
-Argh!
-Or don't.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.996
You think you're gonna
survive this, bitch? Oh!

37:40.040 --> 37:42.390
-I told them where to aim.

37:42.434 --> 37:45.306
Third-base coach of the year.
Let's blow this Bulshar stand.

37:45.350 --> 37:48.353
Ew. Don't say "blow"
and "Bulshar"
in the same sentence.

37:48.396 --> 37:50.006
And what's all this?

37:51.356 --> 37:54.924
Stitch'n'bitch club.
You wanna join?
Mostly we embroider.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.578
Take her back to her cell.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.451
You, wife.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.541
-Do it.
-You do it.

38:02.584 --> 38:03.759
Go on, just grab her.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.327
Move, or I'll
give you a reason to.

38:07.415 --> 38:09.287
So no more begging.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.333
-No more bullshit.
-And no more mercy.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.379
I will get to the garden.

38:14.422 --> 38:19.688
I'll destroy all of their petty
little lives in one breath.

38:27.653 --> 38:29.394
See you on the outside,
asshole.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.615
Oi!!

38:34.616 --> 38:38.054
I've always been
a little slow on the uptake,
but I finally get it. I get it!

38:38.098 --> 38:40.013
Bulshar wants to keep us
hating each other.

38:40.056 --> 38:43.408
That way, we can't come together
and take out our real enemy.

38:43.451 --> 38:44.626
Him!

38:44.670 --> 38:47.977
You really think
you can do it, Earp?

38:48.021 --> 38:49.414
Not by myself.

38:51.024 --> 38:53.635
I was never gonna be able
to do it by myself.

38:55.942 --> 38:59.337
Meanwhile,
we're stuck in a meat factory
and we're running out of wine.

39:00.686 --> 39:01.817
So what do you say?

39:03.689 --> 39:05.952
Anybody want to go break
a goddamn curse?

39:13.002 --> 39:14.090
Waverly.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.727
Charlie.

39:44.730 --> 39:49.909
-Okay, nine letters, "to grow,"
starts with a C.
-Um... crescendo.

39:50.736 --> 39:52.999
You always think
the answers come from music.

39:53.042 --> 39:57.525
I think more answers
should come from music.
In life.

39:57.569 --> 39:58.831
The last idealist.

40:07.535 --> 40:10.669
Try... "cultivate" instead.

40:10.712 --> 40:12.235
You know what?
It'll never be enough.

40:12.279 --> 40:14.847
'Cause I don't even remember
what I'm trying to do here.

40:14.890 --> 40:17.545
-Something that'll save us.
-Yeah, well, I'm drowning.

40:17.589 --> 40:21.114
There's a lot of that
going around.
Don't give up.

40:21.157 --> 40:22.507
Look.

40:23.769 --> 40:24.944
He's right.

40:26.685 --> 40:28.469
Okay. Okay.

40:28.513 --> 40:31.907
Okay, if I could...
if I could just pinpoint...

40:31.951 --> 40:33.822
I mean, there's something
in Bulshar's DNA

40:33.866 --> 40:36.608
that's allowing him
to control the beekeepers,
correct?

40:36.651 --> 40:40.176
-For starters, more beakers.

40:41.177 --> 40:42.178
From my house.

40:43.745 --> 40:46.705
: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Take me with you.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.358
What about... what about Bobo?

40:48.402 --> 40:50.578
I wouldn't trust him
with a pack of gum.
Just leave him.

40:50.622 --> 40:54.147
-Jeremy.
-Look, he tried to kill me once
and my friends more than once.

40:54.190 --> 40:55.540
So... I'm sorry.

40:59.718 --> 41:00.545
Robin?

41:01.676 --> 41:03.199
Please don't leave me alone
in here.

41:04.810 --> 41:05.985
I'm sorry.

41:08.161 --> 41:09.641
Jeremy? Jeremy!

41:11.120 --> 41:13.079
I... I didn't take you
for hard-hearted.

41:13.122 --> 41:15.995
A reckoning is coming.
Lines will have to be drawn.

41:16.038 --> 41:18.084
You have to think
about your dad.

41:18.127 --> 41:20.042
Okay. Okay,
so what's the plan?

41:20.086 --> 41:22.784
Okay, uh,
I don't know if it's real,
but it is real crazy.

41:22.828 --> 41:24.177
With you lot, it usually is.

41:25.918 --> 41:28.747
:
For it to even begin to work,
we need a miracle.

41:52.074 --> 41:53.206
Shit.

41:56.296 --> 41:58.211
Mr. Del Rey.

41:58.254 --> 41:59.778
Sheriff Clootie.

42:00.692 --> 42:04.260
-You're alone.
-I've been abandoned.

42:04.304 --> 42:08.787
I tried to make them see,
but I did too many bad things.

42:08.830 --> 42:10.702
You aren't one of them.

42:16.577 --> 42:18.057
What am I?

42:18.100 --> 42:19.798
What would you say...

42:21.016 --> 42:23.584
if I offered you a job?

42:23.628 --> 42:26.282
I would say...

42:36.031 --> 42:37.816
...what took you so long?
