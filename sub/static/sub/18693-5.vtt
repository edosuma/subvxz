WEBVTT

00:05.860 --> 00:07.086
[Jace] Previously
on Shadowhunters...

00:07.110 --> 00:08.610
[Isabelle] This is
one nasty demon.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.966
- [breathing shakily] What happened?
- Classic possession.

00:10.990 --> 00:12.466
They have no memory
of what they did.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.110
The Clave is
reassigning me to Idris.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.280
- I just got you back.
- I want you to come with me.

00:16.370 --> 00:18.970
The Clave wants to rip your family apart?
Then I'm going with you.

00:19.830 --> 00:21.266
[Lydia] Hole punched
right through his chest.

00:21.290 --> 00:23.016
[Isabelle] Just like our
mundane in the morgue.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.000
It hid in that dead body,
and let us do the rest.

00:25.090 --> 00:27.566
- I didn't know demons could do that.
- I set up a demon attack

00:27.590 --> 00:29.990
- on the Institute as a diversion.
- [Clary] It's inside her.

00:30.050 --> 00:31.670
Go back to Hell
where you belong.

00:32.390 --> 00:33.480
[grunts]

00:33.550 --> 00:35.710
You're not here for me.
You're here for the Soul-Sword.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.220
Take my son. Kill the other one.

00:40.190 --> 00:41.480
Alec.

00:44.860 --> 00:46.030
What did I do?

00:53.870 --> 00:55.500
[arrows whooshing]

01:12.300 --> 01:13.590
[Jace] Alec.

01:18.640 --> 01:19.640
Move.

01:20.230 --> 01:23.650
- How long have you been up here?
- I'm glamoured. No one can see me. Move.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.570
- You can't beat yourself up.
- I'm not.

01:27.270 --> 01:28.270
Who are you talking to?

01:28.900 --> 01:32.150
It's me. I'm your parabatai.
I know exactly what you're going through.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.160
What happened with Jocelyn,
that wasn't you. That was the demon.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.900
- Get out of the way.
- Hey.

01:37.950 --> 01:39.740
Same side. Remember?

01:43.620 --> 01:45.160
Come on, man. Come back inside.

01:46.170 --> 01:47.570
That's the last
place I want to be.

01:48.090 --> 01:51.140
Alec,
Valentine has the Soul-Sword.

01:51.220 --> 01:52.606
He slaughtered the
Silent Brothers.

01:52.630 --> 01:55.350
- We need our best soldiers...
- Stop pretending this never happened.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.020
I couldn't save
you from Valentine.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.690
I couldn't save you from
the City of Bones. I...

02:05.600 --> 02:07.060
She's Clary's mother.

02:10.070 --> 02:11.280
Your mother.

02:15.450 --> 02:17.120
Nobody blames you.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.580
They should.

02:50.980 --> 02:53.110
[Simon speaking Hebrew]

02:58.280 --> 02:59.360
Amen.

03:02.790 --> 03:04.170
I don't know what to say.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.450
My Hebrew that bad?

03:11.090 --> 03:13.640
I just wish I could
get ahold of Luke.

03:15.510 --> 03:18.270
Whenever he goes out of
town, he always tells me.

03:19.180 --> 03:20.180
I'm worried.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.970
Clary, your mom meant
everything to him.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.140
He probably just
needs time to process.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.110
When you died, I was... wrecked.

03:32.270 --> 03:33.270
Devastated.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.360
You were?

03:36.530 --> 03:37.530
Of course.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.820
Simon, I...
I couldn't think of life without you.

03:44.870 --> 03:46.330
But I got you back.

03:52.130 --> 03:53.130
Simon.

03:54.050 --> 03:55.300
You were dead...

03:56.720 --> 03:57.930
but then you came back.

03:58.010 --> 04:01.890
- Well, yeah, but...
- What if we could get my mom back?

04:01.970 --> 04:02.970
Clary, I...

04:03.050 --> 04:06.050
Okay, but in this insane
world we suddenly live in,

04:06.140 --> 04:08.890
things that I never thought
could happen do happen,

04:08.980 --> 04:10.780
so maybe there is a way.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.100
Maybe...
maybe we can get her back.

04:13.190 --> 04:16.269
Clary, I...
I know how much you loved her.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.360
But sometimes there
are things you just...

04:21.200 --> 04:22.450
You have to accept.

04:24.290 --> 04:25.290
No.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.410
I am not ready to accept this.

04:30.620 --> 04:34.000
- [Magnus] Absolutely not.
- Is it possible?

04:34.090 --> 04:36.510
Magnus, tell me, can it be done?
Yes or no?

04:36.590 --> 04:39.106
[sighs] Sure, there are warlocks
who've done this sort of thing.

04:39.130 --> 04:42.630
But what you're talking about is
dark, dark magic.

04:42.720 --> 04:46.440
- It's wildly unpredictable.
- Have you ever done it before?

04:46.520 --> 04:49.690
No. And don't encourage this.

04:51.690 --> 04:56.450
Biscuit, I'm sorry.
I know how important she was to you.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.870
She was my mom. If you were me,
if we were talking about your mom...

04:59.950 --> 05:01.160
I wouldn't bring her back.

05:03.530 --> 05:05.990
- I don't understand.
- [sighs]

05:07.290 --> 05:10.960
I was nine years old when my mother
realized what my cat eyes meant.

05:11.620 --> 05:14.660
She couldn't live with the fact
that she bore the son of a demon.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.260
So she took her life.

05:20.380 --> 05:21.590
With this very keris.

05:24.260 --> 05:26.630
[Clary] I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.930
It was a long time ago.

05:29.020 --> 05:31.610
And over time it...
it got easier.

05:31.690 --> 05:35.440
Never easy, but easier.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.990
Your mother was a special woman.

05:41.070 --> 05:43.200
She only wanted to
protect you at all costs.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.490
So much so that she had
me remove your memories.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.030
Since we can't get those back...

05:54.790 --> 05:56.250
Take one of mine.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.540
Oh, my God.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.590
- When was this?
- The day I met you.

06:06.470 --> 06:09.390
The first thing I notice is that
you both share the same laugh.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.890
[chuckles]

06:12.640 --> 06:14.640
Losing your mom...

06:14.730 --> 06:18.240
it's not something you
make better with magic.

06:19.820 --> 06:23.620
You just head straight into
it and cry your eyes out.

06:33.370 --> 06:34.830
[door opens]

06:34.920 --> 06:36.670
- [Simon] Hey, you okay?
- [door closes]

06:36.750 --> 06:38.250
How about we get
something to eat?

06:38.340 --> 06:40.880
Korean barbecue? That...
that weird rice pudding place?

06:40.960 --> 06:42.630
Anything you want.

06:42.710 --> 06:44.000
Sleep, I think.

06:44.090 --> 06:47.340
- Sure. I'll walk you to the Institute.
- Simon. You should go home.

06:47.430 --> 06:50.810
What? No, no. I'm... I'm not gonna
leave you until I know you're okay.

06:50.890 --> 06:52.400
What does "okay" even mean?

06:53.730 --> 06:56.780
Simon, go home. See your mom.

06:59.190 --> 07:00.650
Tell her you love her.

07:08.410 --> 07:09.580
[door closes]

07:11.450 --> 07:14.830
During the attack on the City of
Bones, Jace Wayland fought bravely,

07:14.910 --> 07:18.620
and thus the Clave, in their wisdom,
has exonerated him from all crimes.

07:18.710 --> 07:20.590
And the chief physician
in Idris reports

07:20.670 --> 07:22.800
that Lydia Branwell's
condition continues to improve.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.140
Out of the infirmary in record time.
Looking good.

07:26.220 --> 07:27.470
I always look good.

07:28.510 --> 07:29.670
Why isn't Alec here?

07:30.260 --> 07:32.590
- He needs some space.
- [Aldertree] We face a new threat.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.956
Valentine has the Mortal Cup,
and now possesses the Soul-Sword,

07:34.980 --> 07:36.980
two of the three
Mortal Instruments.

07:37.060 --> 07:39.246
Our mission now is to find out
what he plans to do with them...

07:39.270 --> 07:41.230
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

07:41.980 --> 07:43.600
But apparently no one else is,

07:43.690 --> 07:45.296
judging by the way
they're all looking at me.

07:45.320 --> 07:49.910
Jace, I'm sorry for letting them
take you to the City of Bones.

07:49.990 --> 07:51.700
- I thought...
- It's all good, Izzy.

07:51.780 --> 07:54.320
You saved Alec's life...
and mine.

07:54.910 --> 07:56.136
I would've done the same thing.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.840
Tomorrow night's rite of passage
will bring the total number of dead

07:58.920 --> 08:02.220
to 26 fallen Silent Brothers
and three Shadowhunters.

08:02.790 --> 08:05.830
Take this time to grieve and
plan for what lies ahead.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.130
Your orders will follow.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.510
[indistinct chatter]

08:09.220 --> 08:11.220
- [groans softly]
- Your shoulder still hurts, huh?

08:11.890 --> 08:13.180
A little stiff.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.010
Uh, don't worry about me.
Keep an eye on Clary.

08:29.860 --> 08:32.400
I should have just said
I'd go to Idris with you.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.450
We could've left right then.

08:39.539 --> 08:40.580
Hey.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.960
- You okay?
- [sighs]

08:43.039 --> 08:45.870
I'd be a lot better if people
quit speaking in quiet voices

08:45.960 --> 08:47.830
and telling me it's
okay to grieve.

08:48.800 --> 08:49.970
Fair enough.

08:51.590 --> 08:53.760
I don't know why.
I just don't...

08:55.100 --> 08:57.520
feel much of anything right now.

08:58.390 --> 09:01.010
[chuckles] Emotions cloud
judgment, right?

09:02.730 --> 09:06.530
Clary, I spent my whole
life fighting my emotions.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.980
Look where it landed me.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.480
You just lost your mom, too.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.120
What do you feel?

09:18.540 --> 09:19.670
I don't know.

09:21.870 --> 09:25.620
I thought I'd be able to get to know her.
And she'd get more time to know me...

09:27.380 --> 09:30.970
as more than just an
experiment gone wrong.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.010
I... [sighs]

09:38.390 --> 09:40.560
I just figured
we'd get more time.

09:45.690 --> 09:47.110
[indistinct chatter]

10:00.870 --> 10:01.950
[beeping]

10:39.200 --> 10:43.700
[chuckles] Look at this.
A Shadowhunter on my doorstep.

10:43.790 --> 10:45.050
Oh, let me guess.

10:45.120 --> 10:49.290
You're heartbroken and you want
some fabulous boy to love you again.

10:49.380 --> 10:50.900
Can you raise my
mother from the dead?

10:52.710 --> 10:56.800
- She just died, and she...
- Oh, God, you poor child.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.940
Oh. I am so sorry.

11:00.810 --> 11:03.520
For your loss.
But also for my big mouth. I...

11:04.850 --> 11:08.270
- How recently did she pass?
- Two days ago.

11:08.350 --> 11:10.270
I know this is considered dark
magic, but...

11:10.360 --> 11:14.280
"Dark magic" is a term used by warlocks
who are afraid of their own powers.

11:14.860 --> 11:18.820
For someone like me who
can harness those powers,

11:18.910 --> 11:20.620
all magic is equal.

11:20.700 --> 11:23.990
So it's possible?
Bringing the dead back to life?

11:28.750 --> 11:31.710
Poor thing flew straight into
that window this morning.

11:31.800 --> 11:35.260
He smacked it so hard,
we heard it from upstairs.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.090
Must have died instantly.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.600
[speaking Latin]

12:01.780 --> 12:02.780
[crow cawing]

12:08.870 --> 12:11.830
So to answer your question...
yes.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.920
It is very much possible.

12:19.970 --> 12:23.520
I have never seen a
doctor's office like this.

12:23.600 --> 12:27.230
- Do you live here, too?
- Upstairs. On the third floor.

12:27.310 --> 12:29.940
The second floor is reserved
for my warlock practice.

12:30.020 --> 12:35.270
And down here is where I try to prolong
the precious lives of the mundanes.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.360
Keeps a gal busy.

12:38.570 --> 12:39.700
[Clary] Hey, there.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.070
- What's your name?
- This is Madzie.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.500
[Clary] Hi, Madzie.

12:46.660 --> 12:49.620
Honey, why don't you go ask
Leigh to give you a cookie?

12:49.710 --> 12:51.380
You tell her I said it was okay.

12:54.710 --> 12:56.540
She's my goddaughter.

12:56.630 --> 12:59.470
Smarter than a whip,
just doesn't speak much.

12:59.550 --> 13:02.180
Anyway, enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

13:02.260 --> 13:06.380
So, I'll need something of your mother's.
A lock of hair, fingernails...

13:06.470 --> 13:08.340
- Yeah, sure. I can do that.
- Wonderful.

13:08.430 --> 13:10.600
And then, of course,
there is the matter of my fee.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.640
Now, I know you don't
have a lot of money,

13:13.730 --> 13:16.940
and, sadly, this is not something
that insurance will cover. [Chuckles]

13:18.150 --> 13:19.520
But I like you.

13:20.950 --> 13:23.700
So, I'll tell you what.
I'll bring your mother back,

13:23.780 --> 13:26.280
and, as payment,
you can owe me a favor.

13:27.660 --> 13:30.530
- Uh, what kind of favor?
- Oh, who can say?

13:30.620 --> 13:34.660
Right now, you need a warlock.
And every so often, I need a Shadowhunter.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.790
When that time will
come, I'm not so sure.

13:38.880 --> 13:41.210
But when it does,
I'll call on you.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.260
How about that?

13:47.100 --> 13:50.690
Luke, I know it's probably
not a good time, but...

13:51.600 --> 13:52.866
you need to get in
touch with Clary.

13:52.890 --> 13:55.270
We're all kind of freaking out.
Clary needs you.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.600
I could use you, too.

13:59.530 --> 14:02.830
So, um...
I'll talk to you soon, I guess.

14:03.740 --> 14:05.370
- Bye.
- [cell phone beeps]

14:08.240 --> 14:09.820
[gasps] Hi, whoa!

14:10.450 --> 14:13.990
[chuckles] Wow.
Slow down, monkey.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.856
- Hey, when you called, I wasn't...
- I'm sorry I wasn't at dinner last night.

14:16.880 --> 14:21.140
I... I wanna move back home, Mom.
I'm really bad at laundry.

14:21.210 --> 14:23.000
Oh, thank God you know
that about yourself.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.960
Honey,
this shirt smells like death.

14:25.050 --> 14:26.340
I just...

14:27.800 --> 14:30.180
I just wanna tell you
that, um...

14:32.890 --> 14:34.970
I really appreciate you, Mom.

14:36.150 --> 14:39.780
[chuckling] Okay. Come on.
I made a roast.

14:39.860 --> 14:42.620
- I know it's overkill, but when...
- Okay, Mom... Mom, listen.

14:42.690 --> 14:44.980
I know I'm back, but I...
I can't have you freak out

14:45.070 --> 14:48.070
if I'm out all night
or if I sleep all day.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.426
The band does a lot
of late-night gigging.

14:49.450 --> 14:51.950
You don't have to explain
yourself to me, Simon.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.380
I'm just glad you're home.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.170
Oh, and you know,
I was thinking...

14:56.250 --> 14:58.290
We should have Clary and
her mother over for dinner.

14:58.420 --> 15:02.760
- I haven't seen Jocelyn in ages.
- Yeah. Um...

15:02.840 --> 15:04.600
- I'll ask Clary.
- Great.

15:09.350 --> 15:10.480
You wanted to see me?

15:11.720 --> 15:13.390
Please. Have a seat.

15:16.600 --> 15:20.140
You and I haven't had a chance to talk
about what happened at the City of Bones.

15:20.230 --> 15:21.670
Just doing what I
was trained to do.

15:22.190 --> 15:26.190
That's how it may appear to the Clave,
but what I saw was an unprepared soldier

15:26.280 --> 15:29.280
allowing a deranged criminal to make
off with one of the Mortal Instruments.

15:30.580 --> 15:32.620
Wait, wait. I... I saved you.

15:34.330 --> 15:35.636
Would you prefer
that I let you die?

15:35.660 --> 15:37.340
That's precisely what
you should have done.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.830
I'd gladly have given my
life to protect the Sword...

15:40.920 --> 15:42.430
just like the
Silent Brothers did.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.250
Now, countless more soldiers
will die trying to reclaim it.

15:45.340 --> 15:47.340
And their blood will
be on your hands.

15:49.090 --> 15:50.720
I'll do whatever I
can to get it back.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.550
I'm afraid your
words are too late.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.246
I'm sending a team to
the Adamant Citadel

15:54.270 --> 15:56.230
to see what the Iron Sisters
know about the Sword.

15:56.310 --> 15:58.230
Great. I'll run point,
draw up a mission.

15:58.310 --> 16:01.640
A soldier without discipline
is poison to his entire squad.

16:02.650 --> 16:04.870
You're hereby banned
from field duty.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.750
You okay?

16:30.050 --> 16:31.460
I can't be in that Institute.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.590
- Oh, Alec...
- Heard you turned in Camille.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.900
How'd that go?

16:37.980 --> 16:39.320
Honestly?

16:41.440 --> 16:42.610
It was awful.

16:43.190 --> 16:45.450
We had a lot of
history, she and I.

16:47.530 --> 16:48.700
I'm sorry if that's weird.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.080
It's not weird.
You say what you think.

16:54.490 --> 16:57.820
- Too busy to use the healing rune?
- I'm fine.

16:58.620 --> 16:59.830
No, you're not.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.550
You're hurting. Badly.

17:03.630 --> 17:07.300
You hope the pain here will
overpower the pain there.

17:10.470 --> 17:12.930
- I wish it were that simple.
- I let a demon in, Magnus.

17:13.510 --> 17:15.950
- That wasn't your fault.
- I don't know what to say to Clary.

17:16.510 --> 17:19.220
- I can't face her.
- But you will.

17:19.310 --> 17:21.569
Because that's what you
do, Alexander.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.319
It may take you a minute,
but I've seen it up close.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.530
I went to your wedding.

17:27.480 --> 17:31.150
You'll blow up the very ground you
stand on to make something right.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.050
What are you doing?

17:52.260 --> 17:53.260
Nothing.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.930
Hey. What is that for?

17:57.760 --> 17:59.090
[sighs]

18:00.140 --> 18:01.930
I went to see a
warlock in Park Slope.

18:02.020 --> 18:04.730
- Her name's Iris Rouse and she...
- Please, please tell me

18:04.810 --> 18:06.246
you're not thinking about
doing what I think...

18:06.270 --> 18:08.230
I can bring my mom back, Jace.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.110
- Our mom.
- You can't, Clary.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.290
She wasn't supposed to
die, Jace.

18:16.030 --> 18:19.530
[stammers] It was a mistake.
A freak demon attack. I...

18:20.700 --> 18:22.370
I want more time with her.

18:23.210 --> 18:24.210
So do I.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
But you never know what
you're gonna get back.

18:27.090 --> 18:28.840
There are always risks.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.300
You could very well conjure
a demon in Jocelyn's form.

18:31.380 --> 18:32.710
You said "could."

18:33.510 --> 18:38.310
- She could also come back the same, right?
- Look, I know you want her back.

18:38.390 --> 18:40.150
But you have to trust me, Clary.

18:42.730 --> 18:45.150
You don't bring people
back from the dead.

18:55.740 --> 18:56.740
[knock on door]

18:56.820 --> 18:58.400
[inhales sharply and grunts]

18:59.910 --> 19:02.130
- [knocking continues]
- Hmm.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.790
- [chuckles]
- [laughing] Okay.

19:11.710 --> 19:14.590
Okay. What's this?

19:14.670 --> 19:16.510
What's, uh...
[clears throat] What's happening?

19:16.590 --> 19:18.616
What, we don't hug anymore?
We used to hug all the time.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.100
Well, first of all, did we?
And secondly...

19:21.180 --> 19:24.430
[sniffs] Oh, God, it stinks.
It's way too dark in here.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.190
Wait, no, don't, don't! Please.
Wait, no, no, don't, don't, please.

19:27.270 --> 19:30.020
Can you please keep those closed?
You know how easily I burn.

19:32.070 --> 19:34.620
- Simon, what's going on?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

19:34.690 --> 19:36.230
- Yeah? Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

19:36.320 --> 19:39.360
Remember Aunt Cheryl?
She had melanoma.

19:39.950 --> 19:42.190
- [smacks lips] It was a freckle.
- That's how it starts.

19:47.710 --> 19:49.050
[Becky] Oh, Simon.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.370
Don't tell me.

19:51.460 --> 19:53.500
- You're turning into a closet drinker?
- No. No.

19:53.590 --> 19:55.720
After everything that I
went through with Mom...

19:55.800 --> 19:57.470
[grunts]

19:57.550 --> 19:58.630
[Simon groans]

19:59.840 --> 20:02.130
Oh, my God. [Clears throat]

20:02.220 --> 20:04.510
- Is this blood?
- Uh, yeah.

20:05.430 --> 20:08.010
Fake blood. Stage blood. For my band.
We're doing this, uh...

20:08.100 --> 20:10.230
This Ozzy Osbourne glitch...
glitch hop thing.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.730
That sounds really terrible.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.140
- Well...
- [sniffs]

20:13.230 --> 20:16.440
Look, I volunteered in a hospital,
and I know what real blood smells like.

20:17.700 --> 20:20.410
Then the guy who
sold it to me lied.

20:20.490 --> 20:21.940
Okay.

20:23.450 --> 20:26.070
So none of this
behavior seems...

20:27.000 --> 20:30.710
- crazy to you?
- Crazy? No.

20:31.630 --> 20:34.550
- Not... not crazy at all.
- Whatever's going on,

20:34.630 --> 20:36.090
- get it together, dude.
- Mmm.

20:36.170 --> 20:39.550
- Flushing this down the toilet.
- No, Becky, please, don't. Don't take...

20:39.630 --> 20:42.260
No, don't, don't please, don't.
No, wait.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.190
[breathing heavily]

20:52.190 --> 20:53.280
[both grunting]

20:57.570 --> 20:58.700
[Jace chuckles]

20:59.780 --> 21:01.830
- [whistles]
- Aldertree can't bench you.

21:01.910 --> 21:03.750
[pants] He already did.

21:03.820 --> 21:05.320
[both grunting]

21:13.670 --> 21:15.550
- Did Alec come home?
- Yeah.

21:15.630 --> 21:18.010
He's still taking
this really hard.

21:18.090 --> 21:20.220
- Have you spoken to Clary?
- She's all right.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.170
She's keeping to herself.

21:22.260 --> 21:24.550
I made some food for her,
but she didn't wanna eat it.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.690
Can you blame her?

21:27.970 --> 21:29.430
[both grunting]

21:37.980 --> 21:41.440
- Come on, Iz. This is way too easy.
- Don't get cocky.

21:45.410 --> 21:47.210
[Jace grunting]

21:59.300 --> 22:00.970
You all right?

22:01.050 --> 22:02.526
It's the demon wound,
isn't it, on your back?

22:02.550 --> 22:04.986
Look, if the runes aren't healing
it, you need to get it fixed.

22:05.010 --> 22:07.410
- I'll see a medic later. Relax.
- Might want to see him now.

22:07.470 --> 22:09.866
A team is going to the Iron
Sisters after the Rite of Mourning.

22:09.890 --> 22:11.050
No way.

22:11.140 --> 22:13.366
You always wanted to be an Iron
Sister when you were a kid, huh?

22:13.390 --> 22:15.730
[chuckles] Until I realized
I had to swear off boys.

22:16.310 --> 22:18.086
- When do we leave?
- You're not going anywhere

22:18.110 --> 22:20.296
with a wound on your back.
Aldertree would never let you.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.560
Aldertree doesn't need to know.

22:24.570 --> 22:26.860
- Iz.
- [grunts]

22:29.540 --> 22:31.170
Yeah, good luck with that.

22:32.540 --> 22:35.170
Look, Izzy,
go and get it checked out.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.750
The last thing we need is another
one of us sidelined. Okay?

22:42.800 --> 22:44.220
[knock on door]

22:45.550 --> 22:46.590
Isabelle Lightwood.

22:47.470 --> 22:50.470
- To what do I owe the pleasure?
- I would like to make a formal request

22:50.560 --> 22:52.650
to lead the mission
to the Iron Sisters.

22:52.730 --> 22:56.570
- Weren't you wounded in the demon attack?
- Yes, but I'm all healed up now.

22:57.190 --> 23:00.410
- I feel fine.
- Your wound. May I take a look?

23:01.150 --> 23:03.770
[chuckles] You know,
I wasn't born a diplomat.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.790
I used to be a field medic.
Sometimes I wish I still was.

23:07.870 --> 23:09.580
Really, I'm okay.

23:09.660 --> 23:11.750
I can't let you on the
mission without an exam.

23:18.580 --> 23:19.580
[sighs]

23:22.960 --> 23:24.000
[groaning]

23:28.720 --> 23:30.560
That's not very pretty, is it?

23:32.430 --> 23:35.560
- Does it hurt?
- No. Not at all.

23:38.020 --> 23:39.480
It looks like a venom infection.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.980
- Healing runes aren't helping much?
- No.

23:43.070 --> 23:46.410
Isabelle, in your condition,
I can't grant your request.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.910
You don't understand. I've waited my
whole life to see the Iron Sisters.

23:50.990 --> 23:52.490
I can do this.

23:52.580 --> 23:54.960
The truth is,
you can't do this, Isabelle.

23:55.750 --> 23:58.170
Not with a venom infection.

23:58.250 --> 24:01.050
But there is something that
can make the infection go away.

24:02.550 --> 24:03.800
Quite quickly, I might add.

24:07.470 --> 24:08.510
I'll take it.

24:09.640 --> 24:10.850
It's called yin fen.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.630
It's quite strong.
I don't usually recommend it,

24:13.720 --> 24:16.390
but if this is a mission
you're set on making...

24:18.020 --> 24:19.440
May I?

24:20.940 --> 24:22.150
Please.

24:29.530 --> 24:30.930
[Aldertree] This
goes on the spine.

24:35.450 --> 24:36.620
[sighs]

24:38.210 --> 24:40.170
- How's that?
- Amazing.

24:41.710 --> 24:42.760
[sighs]

24:42.840 --> 24:44.220
I'll give you a tin.

24:44.290 --> 24:47.590
- Yeah.
- But use sparingly.

24:47.670 --> 24:50.000
- A little goes a long way.
- [sighs]

24:52.930 --> 24:53.980
[sighs]

25:06.230 --> 25:07.230
[knock on door]

25:10.700 --> 25:11.990
[Alec] Hey.

25:14.370 --> 25:17.080
- Look, I, uh...
- Please don't.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.780
Clary, I am so sorry.

25:20.750 --> 25:24.840
I would do anything, I mean anything,
to take back those 30 seconds.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.260
To get your mom back.

25:28.170 --> 25:29.590
Alec...

25:31.050 --> 25:33.670
- maybe we can get her back.
- What?

25:34.970 --> 25:38.340
I found a warlock who
claims she can do it.

25:38.430 --> 25:40.300
But... there are risks.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.440
I'll go with you.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.586
Clary, if there's any chance
that we can get your mother back,

25:45.610 --> 25:49.280
we have to take it.
No matter what happens, I'll be there.

25:50.110 --> 25:51.190
Okay.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.660
Let's do it.

25:57.700 --> 25:58.780
[crow cawing]

26:03.120 --> 26:05.330
Are you here to see Dr. Rouse?

26:07.130 --> 26:09.470
Yes. Um...

26:09.550 --> 26:12.100
I... I think she's expecting me.
My name's Clary.

26:12.170 --> 26:15.670
I was indeed expecting you.
I only wondered when.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.680
And I see you brought a guest.
Your boyfriend?

26:19.430 --> 26:20.930
- Uh, no.
- No.

26:21.020 --> 26:23.360
Well, whatever you are,
leave your weapon outside.

26:24.730 --> 26:28.360
Any warlock worth a damn can see
through Shadowhunter glamour with ease.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.690
Oh, don't worry.
It'll be safe in the alcove.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.636
[Iris] Did you bring
your mother's...

26:41.660 --> 26:43.370
- [Clary] Uh, her hair. Yes.
- Perfect.

26:43.460 --> 26:45.920
Nurse Leigh will help
you with the paperwork.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.870
Uh, paperwork?

26:47.960 --> 26:50.790
Yeah, just a simple pin prick
to draw blood for the oath.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.750
For the favor we talked about.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.800
- Well, I... I don't know about any favor.
- Oh, that was the deal we made.

26:55.890 --> 26:58.680
- It's fine, Alec. I wanna do this.
- Delightful. Follow me.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.090
Your friend can wait here
for you in the waiting room.

27:01.180 --> 27:03.720
No, I'm not leaving her side.

27:04.850 --> 27:06.720
Oh, then I can't do this.

27:07.400 --> 27:12.280
His energy is too turbulent.
I need calm, and he is not calm.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.870
Okay, I'm gonna need to
see some credentials.

27:14.950 --> 27:16.370
Show me your warlock mark.

27:16.950 --> 27:20.290
Dear, if a lady has concealed her
mark, assume it's for good reason.

27:20.870 --> 27:23.250
Alec, it's okay.
I'll be fine. Really.

27:30.670 --> 27:32.080
[sighs]

27:38.390 --> 27:39.470
[Alec] Hello.

27:45.140 --> 27:47.770
Place your mother's lock of
hair on the table, please.

27:50.650 --> 27:54.070
Now, I need you to focus
as intensely as you can

27:54.150 --> 27:56.610
on a cherished memory of your mother.
Can you do that?

27:56.700 --> 27:57.740
Yeah.

27:57.820 --> 28:00.740
That will help repel any demons
that dare come near her soul.

28:02.830 --> 28:04.040
[sighs]

28:09.330 --> 28:11.160
There you go, Clary. Good girl.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.580
Now, let the process begin.

28:26.310 --> 28:28.790
[Simon] Raphael, there has to be
some way to get me blood here.

28:29.310 --> 28:30.680
Look, I... I know it's daytime.

28:31.900 --> 28:34.860
I don't know how much longer
I can control myself, okay?

28:34.940 --> 28:36.360
[knock on door]

28:42.370 --> 28:43.370
[sniffs]

28:47.250 --> 28:48.540
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

28:48.620 --> 28:51.330
I thought I heard you
banging around up here.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.090
Simon, what is wrong?

28:53.170 --> 28:55.510
- You love my roast.
- Mmm-hmm.

28:55.590 --> 28:57.350
And you know if you keep
leaving food around,

28:57.380 --> 29:00.800
- we're gonna have rats again, right?
- You're right, I'm sorry. That's my bad.

29:00.890 --> 29:04.640
[sighs] Becky told me you're
keeping blood in your room.

29:06.140 --> 29:08.050
What's going on?

29:08.140 --> 29:10.060
- Nothing.
- Have you joined a cult again?

29:10.140 --> 29:12.600
Mom, for the last time,
World of Warcraft isn't a cult.

29:12.690 --> 29:13.900
Then what is it?

29:15.690 --> 29:18.230
Come on, monkey.
Just talk to me.

29:19.150 --> 29:21.610
Mom, this is not a normal
person problem, okay?

29:21.700 --> 29:23.540
Simon, I'm your mother.

29:23.620 --> 29:26.920
I'll always love
you, no matter what.

29:26.990 --> 29:29.070
[shuddering] I'm a vampire.

29:31.790 --> 29:33.160
[breathing heavily]

29:35.250 --> 29:38.330
I said it. [Chuckling] Wow.

29:38.420 --> 29:41.590
You... you have no idea how
good it feels to finally...

29:43.260 --> 29:45.170
finally get that off my chest.

29:46.100 --> 29:47.440
[both laughing]

29:51.060 --> 29:53.970
This is your best prank ever.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.980
[sighs] Oh, my gosh.
Keeping the fake blood in your room.

29:57.070 --> 29:59.910
The blackout curtains. Wait.
Do you sleep in a coffin?

29:59.990 --> 30:02.620
No, it's a canoe. And, Mom,
the blood wasn't fake. It was real.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.620
It's cow's blood,
and it's gone now, and...

30:07.330 --> 30:08.330
I'm really hungry.

30:10.750 --> 30:11.790
Oh, you're serious.

30:12.750 --> 30:15.460
It was... [stuttering] I know...

30:15.540 --> 30:18.620
I know how weird this is for you.
But it started, like, a month ago,

30:18.710 --> 30:21.026
where Clary got into this thing
where there are Shadowhunters,

30:21.050 --> 30:25.600
and I got bit by a vampire and I died.
And, look, I know...

30:25.680 --> 30:28.940
I know this sounds totally insane to
you, Mom, but please...

30:29.010 --> 30:31.390
[stammering] please, just...
You have to believe me.

30:32.230 --> 30:34.820
- Tell me... Tell me you believe me.
- I believe you.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.190
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:37.270 --> 30:39.230
- Okay, it's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.280
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.

30:42.990 --> 30:44.620
All gonna be okay.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.950
[Iris chanting in Latin]

30:59.090 --> 31:00.380
[tapping on window]

31:00.460 --> 31:01.880
[crow pecking and cawing]

31:03.050 --> 31:04.180
Oh, my God.

31:04.260 --> 31:05.970
[crow continues
cawing and pecking]

31:06.050 --> 31:08.760
- That bird!
- Focus on your mother, Clary.

31:08.850 --> 31:10.230
- [Clary whimpers]
- [crow cawing]

31:13.480 --> 31:14.690
[cawing continues]

31:16.190 --> 31:17.610
- [neck snaps]
- [Clary gasps]

31:21.940 --> 31:24.480
- [gasps softly]
- [chanting in Latin continues]

31:26.910 --> 31:28.450
No. Stop!

31:28.950 --> 31:29.960
[sighs]

31:31.660 --> 31:32.740
[Alec] It's a nice place.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.450
Where are all your toys?

31:43.670 --> 31:45.090
Cool gills.

31:46.380 --> 31:47.920
[baby crying]

31:57.730 --> 32:00.280
Just because one bird came
back badly doesn't mean...

32:00.360 --> 32:03.006
Well, I'm not willing to take the chance.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

32:03.030 --> 32:06.660
[scoffs] You didn't waste my time.
You still owe me a favor.

32:06.740 --> 32:10.660
- The deal's off.
- No, it's not. You took a blood oath.

32:10.740 --> 32:14.530
- Fine. Call me when you need me.
- I need you now.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.560
[baby fussing]

32:29.630 --> 32:32.630
You are going to host one
of my finest creations.

32:32.720 --> 32:36.100
"Host"?
What are you talking about?

32:36.180 --> 32:40.100
I'm talking about having a baby, Clary.
A baby warlock.

32:42.940 --> 32:43.940
[gasps]

32:44.020 --> 32:45.150
[thuds]

32:52.910 --> 32:55.120
- [thudding continues]
- Let me out!

32:55.200 --> 32:58.200
Warlocks are a dying breed,
and I need young women like you,

32:58.290 --> 33:01.880
healthy and fertile,
that my own private demon can impregnate.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.726
Oh, I wish there was
another way to do it. I do.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.920
But now, with Valentine
threatening to wipe us all out,

33:07.010 --> 33:08.640
we need to build our numbers.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.060
I'm a Shadowhunter.
A demon can't get me...

33:11.140 --> 33:14.770
Pregnant? I think I finally discovered
an elixir that makes it possible.

33:18.810 --> 33:20.860
- You spiked the tea.
- Imagine a baby warlock,

33:20.940 --> 33:24.240
part demon, part Shadowhunter.
Now, that would be something.

33:24.310 --> 33:26.520
Definitely harder to
drive into extinction.

33:26.610 --> 33:28.070
- [grunting]
- [thuds]

33:28.150 --> 33:31.320
The good news is, after the baby's
born, I'll do a memory wipe.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.040
You'll be back home,
none the wiser.

33:37.410 --> 33:39.030
[grunting]

33:44.880 --> 33:49.340
- Shh. There's babies sleeping.
- I'm looking for Clary.

33:50.760 --> 33:51.810
Who?

33:53.970 --> 33:56.850
I came here with her.
You met her. Where is she?

34:11.280 --> 34:12.870
Where is she?

34:13.860 --> 34:15.360
What have you done with her?

34:18.870 --> 34:20.630
You're looking better.

34:21.290 --> 34:22.750
[panting] Told you I was fine.

34:22.830 --> 34:24.226
Have you seen Clary?
I can't find her anywhere.

34:24.250 --> 34:27.260
She's fine.
She left with Alec a few hours ago.

34:28.670 --> 34:31.090
- That warlock...
- Warlock?

34:32.300 --> 34:33.600
[Alec] Talk to me.

34:34.969 --> 34:38.130
- I don't wanna get Iris in trouble.
- Nobody's gonna get in trouble. I promise.

34:39.639 --> 34:41.770
Was that your baby?

34:41.850 --> 34:43.760
One of them, I think.

34:44.690 --> 34:47.239
She takes our memories.
I just remember little bits at a time.

34:47.310 --> 34:50.310
Wait, there's...
there's more of you?

34:51.610 --> 34:53.070
The women come and go.

34:53.150 --> 34:56.820
The babies are placed in homes
where they're cared for. Nurtured.

34:56.909 --> 35:00.710
Please, try to remember.
Where did she take Clary?

35:18.300 --> 35:19.800
[grunting] Alec!

35:22.220 --> 35:23.850
Anyone?

35:25.520 --> 35:26.820
[faint screaming] Alec!

35:29.610 --> 35:31.110
[door creaking]

35:40.490 --> 35:42.320
[demon growling]

35:45.500 --> 35:47.460
- [shuddering]
- [continues growling]

35:55.590 --> 35:57.960
- You take upstairs. I'll take downstairs.
- On it.

36:01.140 --> 36:03.190
- [exhales sharply]
- Where is Clary?

36:03.270 --> 36:04.826
I suggest you take your hands off
me, young man.

36:04.850 --> 36:06.270
- Where is she?
- [exhales sharply]

36:11.150 --> 36:13.450
You've gotta to do better than
that, cheekbones.

36:16.780 --> 36:19.790
Nana! Nana, no.

36:19.860 --> 36:21.400
Oh, hi, honeybun.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.370
Why don't you go back inside?

36:23.450 --> 36:25.950
And don't worry,
I'm just playing with the man.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.340
[Isabelle] Playtime's over.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.080
[whip cracks]

36:30.500 --> 36:31.830
[Isabelle grunts]

36:33.840 --> 36:35.340
Put the girl down.

36:36.010 --> 36:38.430
Her name is Madzie,
and she's better off with me

36:38.510 --> 36:40.890
than left to fend for
herself in this cruel world.

36:45.470 --> 36:49.390
You can save the redhead,
but she still owes me the favor.

36:52.650 --> 36:54.070
[Alec] Izzy.

36:54.150 --> 36:57.530
- Alec. You okay?
- [grunts] We have to find Clary.

37:00.030 --> 37:01.450
[growling]

37:05.740 --> 37:07.240
[growling continues]

37:09.410 --> 37:10.870
[Clary grunting]

37:18.170 --> 37:19.840
Stay back!

37:19.920 --> 37:21.300
[demon snarls]

37:28.810 --> 37:30.440
[demon growling]

37:38.530 --> 37:41.080
[grunts] What the hell was that?

37:41.820 --> 37:43.030
[breathing shakily]

37:43.990 --> 37:45.990
I... I don't know. I...

37:46.700 --> 37:49.160
I saw this vision of a rune and...
and so I drew it.

37:50.370 --> 37:52.080
You just shot sunlight
out of your hand.

37:52.620 --> 37:53.660
[chuckles nervously]

37:53.750 --> 37:56.250
I knew you had a strong skill
set, but that was amazing.

37:56.340 --> 37:57.720
[chuckles]

37:59.050 --> 38:00.140
Where's the rune?

38:01.130 --> 38:02.550
I don't know. It's gone.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.906
Look, whatever just happened,
let's keep this to ourselves.

38:06.930 --> 38:08.510
[footsteps approaching]

38:09.720 --> 38:11.430
- There you are.
- Are you okay?

38:12.140 --> 38:14.180
Yeah. I'm... I'm fine.

38:17.730 --> 38:20.900
Look, I know, but it's very
important that I speak to Dr. Hughes.

38:21.820 --> 38:23.530
No,
it's not a medical emergency.

38:25.160 --> 38:26.250
Actually, it is.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.750
I... No, I don't really
know what's happening.

38:29.830 --> 38:32.150
Yes, so please, can you have
him call me as soon as he can?

38:33.040 --> 38:34.250
Thank you.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.210
- Simon.
- [crunching]

38:47.010 --> 38:48.010
Oh, my... [gags]

39:00.440 --> 39:01.610
[sighs]

39:04.360 --> 39:05.900
[sighing]

39:10.830 --> 39:12.040
[indistinct chatter]

39:22.010 --> 39:23.470
You all right?

39:31.100 --> 39:35.270
Isabelle, you're looking well.
Shoulder's healing nicely?

39:36.230 --> 39:37.980
Yes. Thank you.

39:38.060 --> 39:41.350
[inhales] I don't
see Simon or Luke.

39:41.440 --> 39:43.940
- Clary asked if they...
- The Clave has enforced the order.

40:00.460 --> 40:01.870
I can't do this, Jace.

40:04.510 --> 40:05.930
Yes, you can.

40:07.380 --> 40:08.840
Just don't let go of me.

40:13.890 --> 40:16.220
Those remaining will take
their place with the fallen.

40:24.860 --> 40:27.120
Those remaining will say
the names of the fallen.

40:29.240 --> 40:30.660
[Enoch] Brother Micah.

40:32.990 --> 40:35.160
[all] Pulvis et umbra sumus.

40:37.370 --> 40:38.660
[Isaac] Brother Jeremiah.

40:39.750 --> 40:42.550
[all] For we are
dust and shadows.

40:46.050 --> 40:47.510
[voice breaking] Jocelyn...

40:51.600 --> 40:53.230
[crying] Mom...

40:54.890 --> 40:56.100
[Alec sniffling]

41:01.150 --> 41:02.690
Jocelyn Fairchild.

41:04.980 --> 41:07.610
[all] Ave atque vale.

41:08.650 --> 41:10.940
Hail and farewell.

41:11.780 --> 41:12.780
[Clary sniffling]

41:18.160 --> 41:19.830
[sobbing]

42:04.130 --> 42:05.800
[panting]

42:10.300 --> 42:12.100
- [bones cracking]
- [whimpers]

42:12.180 --> 42:13.060
[growls]

42:13.130 --> 42:15.510
[Luke howling]
