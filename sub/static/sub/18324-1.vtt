but it is for the best.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.999
- No!
- You'll have your chance again.

16:59.034 --> 17:01.235
Next year.

17:08.844 --> 17:12.512
- How could you do this to me?
- Lily, you have to trust me.

17:12.548 --> 17:14.515
This is
the right thing to do.

17:14.550 --> 17:18.618
You need to be with your family.
I'm just trying to protect you.

17:18.654 --> 17:22.522
No! You're killing
everything I ever wanted!

17:22.592 --> 17:25.992
- Everything Beth ever wanted for me!
- That's not fair.

17:26.028 --> 17:31.932
What's not fair is you
taking this dream away from me.

17:32.001 --> 17:35.102
(sniffling)

17:35.171 --> 17:38.539
<i>I didn't know it then, but...</i>

17:38.574 --> 17:41.908
<i>that was the day
I said goodbye to Mark.</i>

17:41.977 --> 17:44.945
<i>And goodbye to ballet.</i>

17:53.889 --> 17:55.822
Last breath in...

17:55.891 --> 17:58.559
(breathing deeply)

17:58.594 --> 18:01.795
Let it all out.

18:01.864 --> 18:06.033
(exhaling)

18:06.068 --> 18:08.035
Namaste.

18:08.070 --> 18:10.904
(class): Namaste.

18:10.973 --> 18:12.906
Thank you.

18:12.941 --> 18:15.976
Bye.

18:16.045 --> 18:18.091
Hey, Lily. Thanks for the great class.

18:18.141 --> 18:20.598
I did not know yoga could
be such a good workout.

18:20.648 --> 18:22.449
- (laughing)
- Um,

18:22.518 --> 18:24.918
so, my office is having
a party next Thursday.

18:24.987 --> 18:27.954
- I don't know if you have plans, but...
- Oh.

18:27.990 --> 18:29.335
- Next Thursday?
- Yeah.

18:29.385 --> 18:30.991
I think I have something

18:31.060 --> 18:35.529
- at my niece's ballet studio--
- Really? I didn't get an invite.

18:35.598 --> 18:38.999
- It's just a dress rehearsal.
- Since when did you ever go--

18:39.068 --> 18:42.002
It's not a big deal, really.
I should've asked earlier.

18:42.071 --> 18:44.037
Anyway, thanks again.

18:44.073 --> 18:48.309
- Great class as always, Lily.
- Thank you.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.278
Really? You go
to dress rehearsals now?

18:51.314 --> 18:53.914
- The point is, I don't date my clients.
- The point is,

18:53.949 --> 18:56.617
- you don't date anyone, honey.
- You know what?

18:56.652 --> 18:59.687
I'm gonna be late to pick up
Sadie. I will see you at dinner.

18:59.755 --> 19:02.989
<i>Mom was right. It was like I'd
developed an allergy to ballet</i>

19:03.025 --> 19:05.959
<i>and men. But the truth is,</i>

19:05.994 --> 19:09.830
<i>spending time with Sadie
was more than enough for me.</i>

19:09.898 --> 19:12.299
(piano music)

19:12.368 --> 19:15.001
<i>I had a lot of reasons
for leaving New York,</i>

19:15.070 --> 19:17.719
<i>but Sadie was the real reason
I never went back.</i>

19:17.769 --> 19:19.673
<i>I could never replace her mother,</i>

19:19.742 --> 19:23.076
<i>but I was determined to help
raise her as best I could.</i>

19:23.112 --> 19:27.514
You must be so proud of Sadie winning
the American Ballet Invitational.

19:27.550 --> 19:31.418
- Yeah.
- I guess that dancing's in her blood.

19:34.923 --> 19:37.858
(piano music)

19:48.437 --> 19:50.504
Please, come in.

19:50.539 --> 19:51.972
Girls,

19:52.007 --> 19:55.309
I think most of you know
Sadie's aunt, Lily Jamison.

19:55.344 --> 19:58.612
Well, like Sadie,
Lily also won the ABI

19:58.648 --> 20:02.115
and actually went on to dance
with the New York Ballet.

20:02.151 --> 20:05.886
- She was a prima ballerina.
- That was a long time ago.

20:05.954 --> 20:09.990
Lily, would you like to do
something with the girls?

20:10.025 --> 20:12.125
I don't dance anymore.

20:13.996 --> 20:16.997
<i>I'm just saying,</i>

20:17.032 --> 20:21.335
you could've done <i> something.</i>
It was so embarrassing.

20:21.370 --> 20:24.738
Oh my goodness,
you're kidding!

20:24.774 --> 20:27.841
- What?
- Uh...

20:27.910 --> 20:31.878
"Based on Sadie's recent
performance in the ABI regionals,

20:31.947 --> 20:35.416
"the Philadelphia Ballet
would like to invite Sadie McRae

20:35.484 --> 20:38.319
"to be a guest artist
performing the role

20:38.354 --> 20:40.721
of Clara in this season's
<i>The Nutcracker."</i>

20:40.756 --> 20:43.324
- (squealing)
- That's a lead role!

20:43.359 --> 20:45.693
With a real ballet company,
just like you,

20:45.728 --> 20:49.863
- Aunt Lily!
<i>- I know what they want.</i>

20:49.898 --> 20:53.099
They want to get her into their school,
and if that works out, their company.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.804
Most people would think
that's a good thing.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.403
No. Sadie is not ready for this.

20:56.439 --> 20:59.707
You mean you're not
ready for this.

20:59.742 --> 21:03.744
She... she's too trusting.
She's too innocent.

21:03.779 --> 21:06.980
I know exactly how you feel.
I remember being faced

21:07.049 --> 21:10.050
with a similar situation,
but Beth convinced me

21:10.118 --> 21:13.019
that nothing was gonna stop you
from pursuing your dream.

21:13.055 --> 21:16.824
I know. But--

21:16.892 --> 21:18.592
No buts. You're going.

21:18.627 --> 21:21.395
This will be good for Sadie
and good for you too.

21:25.468 --> 21:29.903
♪ Go get the old
chimney sweeper ♪

21:29.938 --> 21:33.306
♪ Make sure the chimney
is clear ♪

21:33.342 --> 21:36.744
That's the last of it.

21:36.779 --> 21:38.195
- You got this?
- I got it.

21:38.245 --> 21:38.879
Alright.

21:38.914 --> 21:39.795
Thank you.

21:39.845 --> 21:42.549
Welcome to Philadelphia, ladies.
Have a merry Christmas.

21:42.585 --> 21:45.386
(both): Merry Christmas!

21:45.421 --> 21:48.922
- ♪ Fabulous Christmas
- Wow!

21:48.957 --> 21:51.592
- ♪ I love this time of the year ♪
- I love this apartment.

21:51.627 --> 21:54.361
All it needs is
a Christmas tree.

21:55.163 --> 21:58.999
- Thank you, Aunt Lily.
- Aw...

21:59.034 --> 22:01.902
(jingle bells ringing)

22:04.607 --> 22:07.775
I've never been a guest artist
before. What happens now?

22:07.810 --> 22:11.645
Come on, you're gonna be late.
(man talking)

22:11.714 --> 22:15.282
We're looking forward to a
fantastic <i> Nutcracker</i> this year.

22:15.317 --> 22:18.251
And, as we do
every year, we've invited

22:18.287 --> 22:21.455
a talented newcomer
to dance the role of Clara.

22:21.490 --> 22:24.825
Let's give a warm
welcome to Sadie McRae!

22:24.860 --> 22:27.994
- Where is she?
- Oh! I'm in here!

22:30.232 --> 22:34.501
(sound fades out)

22:36.639 --> 22:40.173
Mark.

22:41.408 --> 22:44.142
Oh my gosh, why is this
happening? Why is he here?

22:44.177 --> 22:47.779
This isn't gonna work.

22:49.416 --> 22:51.383
Are you OK?

22:51.418 --> 22:54.085
Yeah. You know,

22:54.120 --> 22:58.723
teenage girls,
scheduling... it's crazy.

23:00.226 --> 23:03.528
I gotta go.

23:05.599 --> 23:08.700
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

23:08.769 --> 23:11.202
Hi, Lily.

23:11.237 --> 23:15.106
Mark. Hi.

23:15.141 --> 23:17.776
It's good to see you.

23:17.811 --> 23:21.479
It's good to see you
too, I guess.

23:21.515 --> 23:24.148
How have you been?
How's Georgia?

23:24.184 --> 23:26.150
Look, what... what is this?

23:26.186 --> 23:29.253
I mean, you couldn't tell me
that you were here?

23:29.323 --> 23:31.690
I tried to reach you
so many times after New York.

23:31.725 --> 23:34.926
I called you every day for, like,
6 months, but you never responded.

23:34.994 --> 23:38.262
- (stammering)
- I don't know what to say.

23:38.332 --> 23:41.766
This is really strange.

23:41.835 --> 23:45.704
I get it. But so much
time has passed.

23:45.739 --> 23:49.273
Can we at least talk
about what happened?

23:49.309 --> 23:52.243
I don't think that's
such a good idea. I...

23:52.278 --> 23:56.781
Actually, I don't think any of this
is a good idea. I'm taking Sadie--

23:56.850 --> 24:00.785
Wait. You can't
pull Sadie, please.

24:00.854 --> 24:03.822
I had no idea she was your niece when
I saw her tape from the regionals.

24:03.890 --> 24:06.924
I picked her because
she was the best dancer we saw.

24:06.993 --> 24:10.194
She's amazing.

24:10.230 --> 24:12.731
I assume you've been helping.

24:14.868 --> 24:17.935
I don't have anything
to do with dance anymore.

24:21.675 --> 24:25.076
Does anyone else here
know about us?

24:25.144 --> 24:27.144
No. Of course not.

24:27.213 --> 24:30.582
Good, 'cause that would just make an
awkward situation even more awkward.

24:30.617 --> 24:34.151
I understand. I do.

24:34.220 --> 24:36.187
But Sadie deserves

24:36.222 --> 24:38.990
this opportunity.

24:39.058 --> 24:43.094
I'll stay out of your way.
Philly's a big city.

24:44.765 --> 24:47.899
I guess I... I can just
drop her off and pick her up,

24:47.934 --> 24:50.769
I mean, it's not like we have
to see each other all the time.

24:50.804 --> 24:54.706
Dropping off, picking up...

24:54.775 --> 24:58.576
Careful, someone might
mistake you for a dance mom.

24:58.612 --> 25:01.880
Well, I'm not a mom,

25:01.915 --> 25:05.149
and thankfully,
a dance aunt isn't a thing.

25:05.184 --> 25:09.253
Mark, can I have a word with you
about next week's board meeting?

25:09.322 --> 25:11.923
Of course.

25:11.958 --> 25:14.158
Duty calls.

26:05.405 --> 26:09.273
- Alright, you got the door?
- Sorry.

26:09.308 --> 26:11.823
Good morning.

26:11.873 --> 26:13.578
- Hi!
- You gotta be kidding.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.380
I probably didn't mention

26:15.415 --> 26:18.082
that the company owns the building
and puts up some of the staff

26:18.117 --> 26:21.519
- and dancers.
- Hm.

26:24.123 --> 26:26.791
- See you there!
- Ugh.

26:26.860 --> 26:28.405
You OK?

26:28.455 --> 26:31.095
My stomach's just
feeling a little weird.

26:31.130 --> 26:33.813
Probably those cheesesteaks
we ate last night.

26:33.863 --> 26:34.832
Maybe it's Mr. Anders.

26:34.901 --> 26:38.269
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, when I used to sit

26:38.304 --> 26:41.639
next to Tommy Reynolds in math class,
I always felt a little nauseous.

26:41.674 --> 26:44.909
- Why?
- 'Cause he was super cute.

26:44.977 --> 26:47.545
(laughing)
Do you know Mr. Anders

26:47.580 --> 26:50.080
- from anywhere?
- No. Yes.

26:50.116 --> 26:52.784
Well, sort of.

26:52.852 --> 26:56.487
It's a small world, Sadie, and
it just keeps getting smaller

26:56.556 --> 27:01.091
- the older you get.
- You had a crush on him.

27:01.127 --> 27:03.127
It's awfully chilly

27:03.195 --> 27:05.930
in Philadelphia.
Did you remember to pack

27:05.965 --> 27:08.800
all those warm clothes
I laid out for you?

27:08.835 --> 27:11.101
No. Yes.

27:11.137 --> 27:14.338
- Well, sort of.
- Very funny.

27:14.407 --> 27:17.542
Alright, have a great
first rehearsal.

27:17.610 --> 27:20.845
Uh, you're not gonna come in
and see your favorite niece

27:20.914 --> 27:23.748
on her first day with a
professional ballet company?

27:23.783 --> 27:26.484
- Ah--
- If you come in, I promise

27:26.553 --> 27:29.086
I won't ask any more questions
about Mr. Anders.

27:29.121 --> 27:32.022
Fine. Let's go.

27:33.760 --> 27:36.994
(piano music)

27:37.063 --> 27:39.330
Finish strong, finish strong.

27:39.365 --> 27:41.532
Together...

27:41.601 --> 27:43.100
Spice it up.

27:43.135 --> 27:47.204
Nice and sassy.

27:47.273 --> 27:50.007
Nice. Alright,
take five, ladies,

27:50.042 --> 27:54.812
please. Juliette, let's do your
solo from the top, please.

28:00.119 --> 28:02.520
And...

28:02.589 --> 28:06.056
(Tchaikovsky's <i> Nutcracker)</i>

28:29.148 --> 28:32.049
- (Christmas music playing)
<i>- I'm so excited about this!</i>

28:32.118 --> 28:34.732
- What can I get you?
- Two hot chocolates, please.

28:34.782 --> 28:35.855
Whipped cream on both?

28:35.905 --> 28:39.056
- Do you need to ask?
- They told us we have to ask.

28:39.125 --> 28:42.026
I'm kidding, I just meant--

28:42.094 --> 28:46.731
- Never mind. Yes, on both.
- Extra hot soy latte for Mark!

28:46.799 --> 28:50.067
- Hey look, it's Mr. Anders!
- Sadie!

28:50.136 --> 28:51.670
Unbelievable.

28:51.720 --> 28:54.639
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

28:54.674 --> 28:57.307
Hi. Sadie, we have
to go feed the dog.

28:57.343 --> 28:59.810
You have a dog?

28:59.846 --> 29:01.245
No.

29:01.280 --> 29:05.282
Uh, it's someone else's dog.
They asked us to feed him.

29:05.351 --> 29:07.885
- Our building doesn't allow dogs.
- Yeah,

29:07.921 --> 29:10.454
it's in another building.
A dog building.

29:10.523 --> 29:13.558
A building where
they allow dogs.

29:13.593 --> 29:16.594
And cats. Personally,
I prefer dogs.

29:16.629 --> 29:18.796
Uh, two hot chocolates
for Lily?

29:18.865 --> 29:23.000
Sorry, the dog gets really
grumpy when he's hungry.

29:24.470 --> 29:27.104
We're not gonna go
feed a dog, are we?

29:27.139 --> 29:29.239
- No, we're not.
- OK, I know I made a deal,

29:29.275 --> 29:32.139
but can I please ask a few
more questions about Mr. Anders?

29:32.189 --> 29:32.944
Absolutely not.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.980
OK, fine, but just so you
know, I'm a great listener,

29:36.049 --> 29:39.383
- so if you ever need anyone--
- Thanks, I will keep that in mind.

29:39.452 --> 29:42.587
Hey, look!
A gingerbread house!

29:42.622 --> 29:46.256
Just like I used
to make with my mom.

29:50.296 --> 29:52.809
That's the kind of thing
that can make a girl forget...

29:52.859 --> 29:54.665
about her aunt Lily's
deep dark secrets.

29:54.734 --> 29:59.269
Oh, really? Well, then
I guess we'd better go get you

29:59.305 --> 30:01.472
- a smaller one.
- OK!

30:01.507 --> 30:04.241
- Wow, that looks fantastic!
- I know.

30:04.276 --> 30:07.778
Finally some Christmas spirit.
Now all we need is a tree.

30:07.814 --> 30:10.114
Yes, and I promise
we will get one

30:10.149 --> 30:12.382
as soon as I figure out
where they sell them.

30:12.418 --> 30:14.601
Aunt Lily, there's a
place a few blocks away.

30:14.651 --> 30:15.953
Really. How do you know?

30:15.989 --> 30:18.122
It could be all the Christmas
trees with price tags on them.

30:18.157 --> 30:21.358
I'm going to the gym.
Call me if you need me.

30:21.427 --> 30:23.661
(Mark panting)

30:23.730 --> 30:25.796
(Lily sighs.)

30:28.835 --> 30:31.002
- OK, I'll see you later.
- OK.

30:31.070 --> 30:32.569
Have a great day.

30:32.605 --> 30:34.571
- Love you.
- Love you!

30:34.607 --> 30:36.487
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

30:36.537 --> 30:39.537
So here's the deal. Every Tuesday and
Thursday, after drop-off, all the moms

30:39.587 --> 30:42.227
go grab coffee at the Keystone Diner. We
would love it if you would join us.

30:42.277 --> 30:44.497
- That sounds fun, but I--
- No, no, no. No buts. Come on,

30:44.547 --> 30:46.235
we're leaving right now.
I mean, it's just coffee, right?

30:46.299 --> 30:48.332
Sure!

30:48.401 --> 30:50.568
She's in!

30:50.603 --> 30:53.337
It's official,
I'm a dance mom.

30:54.434 --> 30:56.754
All Victoria wants this year
for Christmas are headphones...

30:56.804 --> 30:57.636
that look like earrings.

30:57.671 --> 31:00.005
She'll just have another excuse
to say she didn't hear me.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.775
- (women laughing)
- What does Sadie want?

31:02.810 --> 31:04.777
Uh... How long
do I have?

31:04.845 --> 31:07.179
Do not worry.
When all else fails,

31:07.248 --> 31:09.514
- what do we do?
- (together): Gift cards!

31:09.549 --> 31:11.750
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

31:11.819 --> 31:13.786
- What did I miss?
- Christmas gifts.

31:13.821 --> 31:17.756
- Oh. I am all done.
- Because you're perfect. She's perfect.

31:17.792 --> 31:21.726
- Is your daughter into jewelry yet?
- Sadie's actually my niece.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.728
Her mom died
when she was 7.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.932
Oh, losing your mother
at that age, I can't imagine.

31:27.001 --> 31:29.168
She seems
to be doing well.

31:29.203 --> 31:32.737
Yeah, after her mom died,
she... she really gravitated

31:32.773 --> 31:35.407
towards ballet. I think
she needed something challenging

31:35.442 --> 31:38.210
- to distract her.
- I had to drag Ilene

31:38.245 --> 31:40.345
into class,
kicking and screaming

31:40.380 --> 31:42.948
- those first two years.
- We remember the screaming.

31:43.017 --> 31:46.751
- (Ilene's mom laughing)
- Did Sadie's mom dance?

31:46.787 --> 31:48.720
No, she didn't.

31:48.755 --> 31:50.722
I wonder what inspired Sadie.

31:50.791 --> 31:53.192
She saw you
dancing perhaps.

31:53.227 --> 31:56.195
Umm, no.
I... I don't dance.

31:56.230 --> 31:58.730
Really? You never danced?

31:58.765 --> 32:00.732
I-I mean,

32:00.767 --> 32:02.734
a little as, as a kid,

32:02.769 --> 32:04.736
but... I guess
we all did, right?

32:04.805 --> 32:07.739
Did we?

32:10.044 --> 32:12.544
Hey, is this
a coffee shop or a courtroom?

32:12.579 --> 32:15.180
Think the prosecution's had
a little too much caffeine.

32:15.216 --> 32:17.115
- (some women laughing)
- Ohhh...

32:17.184 --> 32:19.751
And what do you think
about Mark?

32:19.786 --> 32:22.554
Oh! Mr. Anders?

32:22.589 --> 32:24.723
I, um...

32:24.758 --> 32:26.725
I guess he's alright.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.394
He is a ballet master
and a war hero.

32:29.429 --> 32:32.197
- What's not to like?
- Wait. Who was a war hero?

32:32.233 --> 32:36.335
Mark. He served
in Afghanistan.

32:36.403 --> 32:39.437
- I can't believe--
- You can't believe what?

32:39.506 --> 32:42.474
Uh...

32:42.542 --> 32:44.109
I just...

32:44.178 --> 32:48.546
I think he... he seems
like such a ballet guy.

32:48.582 --> 32:51.984
You need to close your eyes
and picture him in a uniform.

32:52.019 --> 32:54.519
Come on. Lily, try it.

32:54.588 --> 32:56.288
Close your eyes.

32:56.323 --> 32:58.857
- I'm in.
- You're always in.

32:58.893 --> 33:01.593
Hey, who wants to split
a piece of cheesecake?

33:01.628 --> 33:02.996
Oh.

33:03.046 --> 33:04.963
(Lily): <i> Was everything
OK at rehearsal today?</i>

33:06.066 --> 33:08.733
The other kids seemed nice.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.969
They're OK.

33:11.038 --> 33:13.638
- Did something happen?
- Doesn't matter.

33:13.707 --> 33:17.742
Sadie, if there's a problem,
it might help to talk about it.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.745
I'm not having
a problem, OK?

33:20.781 --> 33:22.347
Sure.

33:22.416 --> 33:24.416
I'm sorry, Aunt Lily,
it's just

33:24.451 --> 33:26.385
all the rehearsals
and the new people,

33:26.453 --> 33:29.821
I just...
I just don't know.

33:29.856 --> 33:33.225
Hey, I know exactly
what it feels like.

33:33.260 --> 33:36.361
It's hard coming to a new place
and dancing with new people

33:36.430 --> 33:39.197
and trying to fit in
all at the same time.

33:39.266 --> 33:42.634
- Yeah.
- But I tell you what,

33:42.669 --> 33:45.904
your mom would be really proud
of you right now.

33:45.940 --> 33:48.740
You think?

33:48.809 --> 33:52.344
Absolutely.
(Sadie laughing)

33:52.413 --> 33:55.247
- Good night, sweetie.
- Night!

33:55.316 --> 33:57.916
Sorry. No, I am telling you,

33:57.952 --> 34:01.753
I don't think it's a good idea
to tell them about New York

34:01.822 --> 34:03.755
or my history with Mark.
I mean,

34:03.824 --> 34:05.723
[you know how dance moms are.]

34:05.792 --> 34:08.327
Honey, isn't it more stressful
trying to cover it up?

34:08.362 --> 34:12.063
I'm not covering it up;
I'm just...

34:12.132 --> 34:14.732
[being selective
about what I choose]

34:14.801 --> 34:16.868
[to share.]
(sighing)

34:16.937 --> 34:19.504
Are you shaking your head?

34:19.539 --> 34:21.606
[Yes, because being selective
about sharing]

34:21.675 --> 34:25.610
- is no way to make friends.
- [Who says I'm trying to make friends?]

34:25.679 --> 34:28.013
(chuckling)

34:28.047 --> 34:30.449
I have to admit though,
it is pretty cool

34:30.516 --> 34:32.750
being around
a dance company again.

34:32.819 --> 34:36.455
[All the hard work and seeing it
all come together...]

34:37.858 --> 34:39.791
...really brings me back.

34:39.826 --> 34:42.659
Do you miss it?

34:42.696 --> 34:45.397
[A little. Maybe.]

34:45.431 --> 34:48.333
I don't know.

34:48.369 --> 34:51.436
Right now,
I am just focused on Sadie.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.205
She's all that matters.

34:53.239 --> 34:57.109
She has no idea how lucky
she is to have you in her life.

34:58.945 --> 35:02.214
- I love you, Mom.
- [I love you too, baby.]

How about dinner?

Wow! Now, that's what I call
a Christmas tree.

37:56.109 --> 37:59.209

way too big!

37:59.245 --> 38:02.479
- And way too expensive.
- No, come on, it's beautiful!

Douglas fir right here.

38:14.226 --> 38:16.827

- Yeah, and a tree like this

38:27.106 --> 38:29.540
might really, you know,
spruce up the place.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.876
- Ugh!
- You're obviously

38:31.911 --> 38:34.178
pining for a tree.
(Sadie giggling)

38:34.213 --> 38:36.814
- Trying to branch out?
- You need to stop now.

38:36.849 --> 38:39.349
- (Sadie): Yeah.
- Trees like this don't just

38:39.385 --> 38:42.219
- grow on trees, you know?
- We'll take it.

38:44.891 --> 38:46.857
Sold!

38:46.893 --> 38:48.859
If you like, I can give you
a hand, get it up to your place.

- OK!
- No thanks.

38:51.731 --> 38:55.833
Unless of course,
"tree" is a crowd?

38:57.003 --> 38:59.269
Ah...
<i>OK, we almost</i>

38:59.338 --> 39:01.271
made it! Oh, Sadie,

39:01.340 --> 39:03.574
good thing we didn't get
that 15-foot tree.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.876
Oh, come on, that would have
been so much more awesome.

39:05.912 --> 39:07.644
This one's going
to be perfect.

39:07.714 --> 39:09.613
Alright, where
should we put it?

39:09.682 --> 39:12.049
- Sorry.
- Alright, where's the stand?

39:12.085 --> 39:14.451
I thought it was
on there.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.786
Nope.

39:15.855 --> 39:19.023
Oh no. Really, guys?
It must have fallen off.

39:19.058 --> 39:21.425
I'm sorry, Sadie.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.427
Hey, we'll get another one.

39:23.495 --> 39:26.764
OK. See you later,
Mr. Anders.

39:26.799 --> 39:29.100
See you, Sadie.

39:29.168 --> 39:32.002
- Thanks for your help.
- Anytime.

39:32.071 --> 39:34.972
Hey, is that...?

39:35.007 --> 39:37.007
So you were in the military?

39:37.076 --> 39:38.876
Because some of the other moms
were talking

39:38.945 --> 39:41.912
- today and--
- I had fun today.

39:41.948 --> 39:43.981
Good night, Lily.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.699
- (The piano music stops.)
- OK. OK, good.

40:02.769 --> 40:04.969
A little more plié
in the spin around,

40:05.004 --> 40:07.304
but otherwise,
this section's really improving.

40:07.339 --> 40:09.874
I think the tempo is
a little brisk. Just a moment.

40:09.942 --> 40:12.910
When we're circling around,
I really need more resistance

40:12.945 --> 40:14.845
or I'm gonna fall on my butt,
and that will be embarrassing--

40:14.914 --> 40:16.814
Why do you keep trying
to direct everybody?!

40:16.849 --> 40:19.817
- Uh, I was just suggesting.
- It's not your job.

40:19.852 --> 40:22.119
- You're not the director.
- Stop being such a know-it-all!

40:23.956 --> 40:26.857
Hey! How was it?

40:26.893 --> 40:28.759
(Sadie sighs.)
Uh-oh!

40:28.795 --> 40:32.663
(indistinct chatter)
I take it it didn't go so well?

40:32.698 --> 40:35.166
- Sadie! What's wrong?
- I was just trying

40:35.234 --> 40:37.168
to help another dancer
with the choreography.

40:37.203 --> 40:39.436
Wasn't that
Mr. Anders' job?

40:39.471 --> 40:42.840
Oh, great! So now
you're on their side? Wow!

40:44.376 --> 40:46.043
Sadie!

40:46.078 --> 40:48.078
You know that's not true.
(knocking)

40:48.147 --> 40:50.681
- (music of <i> The Nutcracker)</i>
- Oh! Hey.

40:50.716 --> 40:53.884
Hi. I was wondering...

40:53.953 --> 40:55.886
What's that awful smell?

40:55.955 --> 40:58.856
Uh, I was just burning
some popcorn. Come in.

40:58.891 --> 41:01.125
- Ah.
- So to what do I owe

41:01.160 --> 41:04.862
- the honor?
- Uh...

41:04.931 --> 41:07.865
I'm worried about Sadie.

41:07.900 --> 41:11.468
Apparently, she's been giving
some of the other kids advice,

41:11.503 --> 41:14.872
and, uh, it's not going so well.

41:14.907 --> 41:16.874
Hey, I get attitude

41:16.943 --> 41:18.742
and I'm the director.

41:18.811 --> 41:20.811
Do you think
she's coming down with a case

41:20.847 --> 41:23.613
- of the Clara complex?
- Well, sure.

41:23.682 --> 41:25.582
She's 14. Her first big role
at the company.

41:25.651 --> 41:28.919
I guess her ego was bound
to get a little out of control.

41:28.955 --> 41:33.523
Might be helpful if you were
around her in rehearsals.

41:33.559 --> 41:36.727
- You think that would help?
- I do. And while you're there,

41:36.795 --> 41:39.396
I could really use help with
this year's Sugar Plum Fairy.

41:39.465 --> 41:42.566
- What?
- She's having some mechanical issues.

41:42.634 --> 41:45.870
No. I...
I'm not a dancer anymore.

41:45.905 --> 41:47.537
I haven't danced
for a really,

41:47.573 --> 41:49.706
really long time.
Why would she even listen to me?

41:49.742 --> 41:51.876
Lily, I'm not asking you
to dance, just give her

41:51.911 --> 41:54.544
- some pointers.
- I-I don't know, Mark.

41:54.580 --> 41:56.947
What's the issue?
Working with me?

41:56.983 --> 41:58.883
Working with another dancer?
Getting involved

41:58.918 --> 42:01.952
- in the whole ballet scene again?
- Uh, D, all of the above.

42:02.021 --> 42:04.048
OK, I'm gonna let
you in on a little secret.

42:04.098 --> 42:05.489
You're in way over your head?

42:05.524 --> 42:08.359
No. You think
I'm in over my head?

42:08.394 --> 42:10.361
Well, if you're asking,
I guess you must be.

42:10.396 --> 42:12.162
I just like
having you around,

42:12.198 --> 42:15.632
- that's all. You've good energy.
- Thanks, coach.

42:15.701 --> 42:18.568
But since you think I'm in over my head,
then you have to help me.

42:18.604 --> 42:20.604
- Oh, I "have" to help you?
- Uh-huh.

42:20.672 --> 42:24.275
- Is that a rule?
- It's a preference.

42:24.343 --> 42:27.077
- (Lily sighing)
- I know.

42:27.113 --> 42:30.281
I know, I was supposed
to get a tree stand.

42:30.349 --> 42:32.449
Why bother? It's not like
we have any ornaments.

42:32.518 --> 42:35.319
Hey! I'll make you
a promise.

42:35.388 --> 42:37.888
By this time tomorrow,
that tree will be

42:37.924 --> 42:41.625
standing on its own,
and it will be lit up like a...

42:42.995 --> 42:44.861
Like a Christmas tree.

42:44.931 --> 42:48.632
(both laughing)

42:48.667 --> 42:51.768
(jingling bells)

42:51.804 --> 42:53.037
- It's the same problem.
- Listen, I don't care

42:53.105 --> 42:55.039
what the problem is.
It's personal.

42:55.107 --> 42:57.074
No, you don't.

42:57.143 --> 42:59.643
Take a five and fix it.
You hear me?

42:59.678 --> 43:02.146
It's so simple.
(indistinct chatter)

43:02.181 --> 43:03.914
Sounds a little rough
in there.

43:03.950 --> 43:06.951
Well, when your lead dancers
are also a couple on the rocks,

43:06.986 --> 43:09.386
it can provoke
certain emotions.

43:09.455 --> 43:11.621
Today apparently,
they're off again.

43:11.657 --> 43:14.425
Sounds vaguely familiar.
(Mark sighs.)

43:14.460 --> 43:16.626
Listen, I'd love it
if you could help her

43:16.662 --> 43:18.662
with the big lift.

43:18.697 --> 43:21.131
(Lily sighs.)

43:21.167 --> 43:24.534
OK, but can we do it
in the small studio?

43:24.603 --> 43:26.803
It's a little more private
back there.

43:26.839 --> 43:30.507
Yes. Thank you.

43:33.980 --> 43:36.546
(indistinct chatter)

43:38.117 --> 43:41.085
OK, gang, I've brought in

43:41.153 --> 43:43.053
another set of eyes to help us
with the big lift.

43:43.122 --> 43:44.855
- This is Lily Jamison.
- Hi.

43:44.923 --> 43:48.025
- Aren't you Clara's mom?
- Sadie. Her name is Sadie.

43:48.094 --> 43:50.294
- Whatever.
- I'm her aunt.

43:50.329 --> 43:52.863
- What is she doing here?
- OK. Let's just show her

43:52.898 --> 43:55.499
what we've got, huh? Here we go.

43:56.935 --> 44:00.070
And...

44:00.139 --> 44:03.007
(Juliette grunts.)

44:03.042 --> 44:05.109
- What's going on here?
- Uh,

44:05.177 --> 44:07.511
Juliette, I think you need
to jump a little higher.

44:07.546 --> 44:09.513
- He could bend a little lower.
- I still think you need

44:09.548 --> 44:12.483
to jump a little higher. I just
don't want to see you get hurt.

44:12.518 --> 44:14.418
Thank you.
That makes the two of us.

44:14.487 --> 44:16.820
OK, let's try this
again, please.

44:18.991 --> 44:20.824
Here we go.

44:20.859 --> 44:23.027
And...

44:23.095 --> 44:27.731
- Hm! Ah!
- Oh! Are you OK?

44:29.868 --> 44:32.136
Juliette, wait!

44:32.171 --> 44:34.138
I have been dancing
with this company

44:34.173 --> 44:36.740
for seven years now;
you really expect me

44:36.808 --> 44:38.808
to take instructions
from some dance mom?!

44:38.844 --> 44:40.810
Dance aunt actually.

44:40.846 --> 44:42.679
For your information,
Lily and I danced together

44:42.714 --> 44:44.748
at the New York Ballet.
She's one of the most gifted

44:44.816 --> 44:47.851
dancers I've ever worked with.
You should be grateful

44:47.886 --> 44:50.120
that someone of her caliber
is willing to work with you.

44:50.189 --> 44:52.822
(Juliette sighs.)

44:54.960 --> 44:57.557
Uhhh, that just slipped out. I'm sorry.

44:57.607 --> 44:59.029
I gotta get out of here.

44:59.065 --> 45:02.832
- (indistinct chatter)
- I'm coming with you.

45:04.070 --> 45:06.370
I have something
I have to do.

45:06.405 --> 45:09.906
- Hot date?
- Yeah, with a tree stand.

45:13.047 --> 45:17.216
It's all about personal taste.
You got your bucket tree stand.

45:17.252 --> 45:20.053
You got your snowflake
tree stand.

45:20.088 --> 45:22.188
You really don't care, do you?
(Christmas music playing)

45:22.223 --> 45:23.989
No. No, I do. I...

45:24.059 --> 45:28.061
I was just thinking
something a little more basic.

45:28.096 --> 45:30.930
Put a tree in it.
It stands up.

45:30.998 --> 45:33.332
- It's a tree stand.
- (chuckling): OK.

45:33.401 --> 45:35.634
- ♪♪♪
- And then when Sadie gets home

45:35.670 --> 45:38.304
from rehearsals,
she'll be really happy.

45:38.339 --> 45:40.940
And you get points
for being a good aunt.

45:40.975 --> 45:42.708
(man): Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

45:42.777 --> 45:44.777
(girl): Santa, I want
a puppy for Christmas.

45:44.812 --> 45:47.880
I remember. I used to beg
my mom to take me see Santa

45:47.949 --> 45:50.183
and then as soon
as I saw him, I'd freak out

45:50.251 --> 45:52.685
- and wanna go home.
- Ha!

45:52.753 --> 45:55.088
When I was a kid, I would
show up to see Santa with a list

45:55.123 --> 45:58.057
and just hand it to him because
I didn't trust his memory.

46:00.595 --> 46:03.028
I don't know what I'm gonna tell
those other moms tomorrow.

46:03.098 --> 46:05.164
I was really trying
to keep our relationship

46:05.233 --> 46:07.166
and my dancing in the past.

46:07.202 --> 46:09.168
Yeah, I'm sorry
about that.

46:09.204 --> 46:12.138
No, it's...
it's my fault really.

46:12.173 --> 46:14.073
I should have
just been upfront about it.

46:14.109 --> 46:16.309
(Christmas music playing)

46:16.344 --> 46:18.677
I guess I'll go
with the snowflake.

46:20.781 --> 46:22.881
Semper fi.

46:32.093 --> 46:34.026
Hi.

46:34.095 --> 46:35.995
Sorry.

46:36.030 --> 46:38.331
Sadie's running late,
she'll be down in three minutes.

46:38.366 --> 46:41.400
- I have something to--
- I have something I wanted--

46:41.469 --> 46:43.402
Uh, is it OK
if I go first?

46:43.471 --> 46:46.739
- Sure.
- Yesterday,

46:46.807 --> 46:49.542
the whole thing
with Juliette, I...

46:49.611 --> 46:52.278
- I owe you an explanation.
- No, you don't owe me anything.

46:52.313 --> 46:55.914
No, I-I do. Um,

46:55.983 --> 46:57.683
Mark and I used to dance

46:57.718 --> 47:00.953
in New York,
but it was a long time ago

47:01.022 --> 47:03.556
and it's just something
I don't talk about anymore.

47:03.625 --> 47:06.025
The thing is that Sharon
found this old photo online

47:06.093 --> 47:07.993
of you and Mark
from back then,

47:08.029 --> 47:10.929
and pretty clear you guys were
more than just dance partners.

47:12.867 --> 47:14.267
We were.

47:14.302 --> 47:17.537
The problem is now she's
telling everyone that Sadie got

47:17.605 --> 47:19.805
the role of Clara because
you and Mark used to date.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.541
What?!

47:21.576 --> 47:24.544
No, listen, I know
that Sadie absolutely deserves

47:24.579 --> 47:27.346
to be Clara. I mean,
I've seen the girl dance.

47:27.382 --> 47:29.549
I just wanted you to know
what everyone was saying.

47:29.584 --> 47:33.052
I don't understand. Did I do
something to offend Sharon?

47:33.120 --> 47:35.721
There was a lot
of talk last year

47:35.756 --> 47:37.723
that Sharon's daughter
would be cast as Clara,

47:37.758 --> 47:40.726
but Mark really wanted to stick
with the guest-dancer tradition,

47:40.761 --> 47:42.562
and so...

47:44.065 --> 47:46.065
Sorry.

47:46.100 --> 47:48.000
I'm ready.

47:48.035 --> 47:51.170
Thank you.
(music of <i> Silent Night</i> playing)

47:56.077 --> 47:57.476
(door chime)

47:57.545 --> 47:59.778
Hey. What's going on?
Are you OK?

47:59.847 --> 48:02.493
People are saying the
only reason Sadie got the role...

48:02.543 --> 48:03.616
was because you and I used to date.

48:03.685 --> 48:06.586
What?! We chose Sadie
because she was the best.

48:06.621 --> 48:09.188
So you promise,
having her in this production

48:09.224 --> 48:11.557
has nothing to do with me?

48:11.593 --> 48:13.826
I'm not gonna tell you that
seeing you again isn't nice,

48:13.861 --> 48:16.028
but honestly, if I had known
Sadie was your niece,

48:16.063 --> 48:17.996
I probably wouldn't
have chosen her

48:18.065 --> 48:19.898
because of what happened
to us in New York.

48:19.967 --> 48:21.867
You mean, what you did
to us in New York.

48:21.902 --> 48:24.303
I didn't mean to do anything,
but love you,

48:24.372 --> 48:27.406
to watch out for you.

48:27.442 --> 48:30.042
Lily, I thought
I was doing the right thing.

48:30.077 --> 48:31.877
I believed in my heart

48:31.912 --> 48:33.879
that you should go home
to your family.

48:33.914 --> 48:36.415
Well, that wasn't
your decision to make.

48:38.453 --> 48:41.754
You have no idea
how badly you hurt me.

48:41.789 --> 48:45.258
You think you were the only one who
was hurt, whose life was changed?

48:45.293 --> 48:48.827
My sister died.
I wanted to dance.

48:48.896 --> 48:51.264
That was my choice,

48:51.299 --> 48:54.066
no matter how crazy
you thought it might seem.

48:54.101 --> 48:56.335
(gentle music)

48:58.539 --> 49:00.473
I know how important
it was for you

49:00.508 --> 49:02.642
to dance that night.

49:02.710 --> 49:05.711
And I know whatever I decided
might hurt you,

49:05.780 --> 49:07.846
might hurt us,

49:09.484 --> 49:13.051
And you were in so much pain
and so vulnerable.

49:13.120 --> 49:15.621
It was an impossible situation.

49:17.224 --> 49:20.293
I've been struggling
with this forever.

49:22.062 --> 49:24.062
You're right,

49:24.098 --> 49:26.198
I should have
fought for you.

49:27.602 --> 49:31.203
Your choice should have
been my choice.

49:40.981 --> 49:44.049
Yesterday, when you were
working with Juliette...

49:45.853 --> 49:48.321
(Lily sniffling)
...she could have hurt herself.

49:48.356 --> 49:50.690
She almost did.
She was so upset.

49:54.094 --> 49:56.295
That could have been me.

49:58.098 --> 49:59.898
I couldn't see it
eight years ago,

49:59.967 --> 50:02.335
but yesterday,
for the first time...

50:05.373 --> 50:07.340
...I know you were
protecting me.

50:07.375 --> 50:10.943
You shouldn't be the one
that's sorry. I'm sorry.

50:13.113 --> 50:15.247
(cell phone dinging)

50:17.017 --> 50:19.051

50:19.086 --> 50:21.053

50:21.088 --> 50:23.956
Oh! You should get that.

50:27.127 --> 50:29.362
(Lily chuckling)

50:34.669 --> 50:37.035
Juliette just quit
the company.

50:37.071 --> 50:40.038
- Oh no!
- Yeah, I mean,

50:40.074 --> 50:41.940
Suzanne's her understudy,

50:42.009 --> 50:45.043
but she's got to get
up to speed right away.

50:46.714 --> 50:48.947
I could probably do it
with a little help.

50:49.016 --> 50:52.150
'Cause that went so well
the first time.

50:52.219 --> 50:54.854
(both chuckling)

50:59.326 --> 51:02.027
Thank you.

51:02.062 --> 51:04.029
(soft Christmas music playing)

51:04.064 --> 51:06.465
The other kids
are so mean.

51:06.534 --> 51:08.734
I know it can be
really competitive.

51:08.803 --> 51:10.403
You think?

51:10.438 --> 51:13.939
Sometimes, it feels
a little cruel, doesn't it?

51:13.974 --> 51:16.041
Yeah.

51:16.076 --> 51:18.043
They're saying I only got
the part of Clara

51:18.078 --> 51:20.045
because you and Mr. Anders
used to date.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.347
You heard that?

51:24.084 --> 51:27.420
(Lily sighing)

51:27.455 --> 51:29.889
I just want them to know
that I'm a good dancer.

51:29.924 --> 51:32.057
Oh, Sadie, sweetie,

51:32.092 --> 51:34.427
I'm so sorry.

51:34.462 --> 51:37.596
No. This is a professional
dance company;

51:37.632 --> 51:40.599
you only dance
if you deserve to be there,

51:40.635 --> 51:42.835
like you.

51:42.904 --> 51:46.572
You just do your best,
and they'll know you belong.

51:46.607 --> 51:49.007
I guess.

51:50.210 --> 51:52.044
You know what your mom
used to say to me?

51:52.112 --> 51:55.280
What?
(gentle guitar music)

51:55.316 --> 51:58.183
"One plié at a time."

52:01.288 --> 52:05.157
- Can you do that?
- I can try.

52:06.661 --> 52:08.661
Good.

52:08.696 --> 52:11.497
Do you ever wish
that you haven't given up dance?

52:16.938 --> 52:18.604
Every now and then,

52:18.673 --> 52:21.540
but everything happens
for a reason.

52:21.609 --> 52:25.310
And if I'd stayed
in New York,

52:25.346 --> 52:27.813
then I couldn't
have raised you.

52:29.383 --> 52:32.050
- I love you, Aunt Lily.
- Oh,

52:32.119 --> 52:35.220
I'm pretty crazy about you too.

52:35.255 --> 52:37.189
- Alright. Let's decorate.
- OK.

52:39.793 --> 52:42.594
- (Mark clapping twice)
- Alright. Listen up, guys.

52:42.630 --> 52:45.563
I have some good news
and I have...

52:45.599 --> 52:47.565
Let me rephrase that.

52:47.601 --> 52:49.968
I have some news
and I have some other news.

52:50.004 --> 52:51.003
What's the news?!

52:51.038 --> 52:52.504
(laughing)

52:52.539 --> 52:54.506
Juliette has left the company.

52:54.541 --> 52:56.341
Wait, did you know
about that?

52:56.409 --> 52:59.177
The good news
is that Suzanne Tyler will be

52:59.212 --> 53:01.379
getting a well-deserved
opportunity to shine

53:01.414 --> 53:04.816
as the Sugar Plum Fairy. Let's
hear it for Suzanne, come on!

- to the big city.
- That's what happens

53:21.201 --> 53:24.536
- when your mom dates the director.
- Ahem!

53:24.604 --> 53:26.171
Either of you two
compete at the Regionals?

53:26.206 --> 53:28.473
- I did.
- And?

53:28.508 --> 53:31.176
I had a sinus infection
that weekend.

53:31.211 --> 53:34.345
Sadie won the Regionals.
First place.

53:34.381 --> 53:37.182

you should know.

- Nice job.

53:41.354 --> 53:43.188
Not a bad day after all.

53:43.223 --> 53:45.290
Yeah, I saw how
you handled things with Sadie

53:45.358 --> 53:47.726
and the other kids.
You were good.

53:47.761 --> 53:49.861
Well, there's one thing
I'm really not good at.

53:49.897 --> 53:52.397
- Christmas shopping.
- I'm great at it.

53:52.465 --> 53:54.166
That's what I thought.
How would you guys like

53:54.201 --> 53:56.168
to do me a favor
and show me how the pros shop?

53:56.203 --> 53:59.171
- Sure!
- It's a date.

you don't talk about?

I can give you my rank,

Well, Sadie is going
to the movies

57:56.243 --> 57:58.143
with the other girls, so...

(smooth jazz version

...I guess I could do that.

58:04.217 --> 58:05.917
(indistinct chatter)

58:06.920 --> 58:09.120
When you left New York,
I was hurting.

58:09.156 --> 58:11.156
I needed change.

58:11.224 --> 58:13.158
I wasn't sure
what to do.

58:13.226 --> 58:15.226
My family's
military history,

58:15.262 --> 58:16.962
knowing what was
going on overseas;

58:16.997 --> 58:19.197
enlisting just felt
like the right thing for me.

58:19.266 --> 58:21.166
That was a big change.

58:21.234 --> 58:23.335
Yeah. It was rough.

58:25.405 --> 58:27.605
I lost some friends.

58:27.674 --> 58:31.142
And that's why
I don't talk about it.

58:31.178 --> 58:33.878
So sorry.

58:35.548 --> 58:38.916
Must have been hard
coming home.

58:38.952 --> 58:40.651
Felt disconnected.

58:40.720 --> 58:42.454
For the first time,
I began to regret

58:42.489 --> 58:44.389
I had lost my chance to dance.

58:44.424 --> 58:47.792
So how did you
end up here?

58:47.827 --> 58:50.695
Dance is really
the only thing I know.

58:50.763 --> 58:53.131
But you're not dancing.

58:53.166 --> 58:54.665
Yeah.

58:54.734 --> 58:58.269
Directing just sort of
came naturally.

58:58.305 --> 59:01.606
I guess I got used to bossing
people around in the service.

59:01.641 --> 59:03.475
So what were you?
Like an officer

59:03.543 --> 59:07.245
- or something?
- I was a gunnery sergeant.

59:07.314 --> 59:10.015
Oh!

59:10.083 --> 59:13.385
Well, Gunnery Sergeant Anders...

59:15.788 --> 59:17.688
...how would you like
to come over to our place

59:17.757 --> 59:20.058
for Christmas dinner
after the show?

59:21.861 --> 59:25.296
I mean, since we're across
the hall and all.

59:27.200 --> 59:29.167
I'll be there.

59:37.177 --> 59:40.111
Nothing. What?
I'm just feeling good.

59:40.147 --> 59:41.612
OK.

59:41.648 --> 59:43.948
I had a good night's sleep.

59:43.983 --> 59:45.883
Just a good night's
sleep? Really?

59:45.952 --> 59:48.986

- Nothing else going on?

59:49.022 --> 59:50.988
Nothing else with a guy
who maybe you knew

59:51.024 --> 59:53.158

I'll see you

- (Sadie): Hi.

01:00:01.401 --> 01:00:04.702
- Hi there.
- Hi.

01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:07.105
Look. Maybe it
was wishful thinking

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.840
that I could keep my
relationship with Mark a secret,

01:00:09.876 --> 01:00:12.710
But this idea that Sadie got
the role of Clara

01:00:12.779 --> 01:00:15.313
because of that relationship
is just hurtful.

01:00:15.348 --> 01:00:18.983
Especially to Sadie.

01:00:19.018 --> 01:00:20.718
I'm sorry.

01:00:20.787 --> 01:00:23.521
I hope so. Because it
really needs to s--

01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:26.424
(siren wailing)
Uh-oh.

01:00:48.515 --> 01:00:50.448
You're kidding, right?

01:00:50.517 --> 01:00:52.350
I don't have
anyone else, Lily.

01:00:52.385 --> 01:00:56.287
I can't just step into a lead role cold.
You know it doesn't work that way.

01:00:56.356 --> 01:00:58.189
If you don't dance
the Sugar Plum, there's no show.

01:00:58.225 --> 01:01:01.126
I don't want to embarrass
myself. Or the company.

01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:03.595
- I'll work with you.
- That's great, but you're not

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:05.396
putting on pointe shoes for
the first time in eight years.

01:01:05.432 --> 01:01:09.167
You can do this. I wouldn't ask you
if I didn't know you could do it.

01:01:09.236 --> 01:01:11.202
OK. I love that you're
so sure, but if I'm going

01:01:11.238 --> 01:01:14.305
to be up on that stage,
it's important that I'm sure.

01:01:14.374 --> 01:01:16.407
What's going on?

01:01:16.443 --> 01:01:19.144
Mark's asking me to dance
the Sugar Plum Fairy.

01:01:19.212 --> 01:01:22.447
- (giggling)
- Oh. Wait. This is for real?

01:01:22.516 --> 01:01:24.815
Yeah! It's for real.

01:01:26.919 --> 01:01:28.620
What?

01:01:28.655 --> 01:01:31.289
If you don't do it, you'll
never know what might have been.

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.261
Yes!

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:44.351
It's beautiful.

01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.787
We have it all to ourselves
until opening night.

01:01:46.822 --> 01:01:49.657
(she sighs)
Feel free to embarrass yourself.

01:01:56.865 --> 01:02:00.201
I haven't felt butterflies
like this in a long time.

01:02:02.338 --> 01:02:04.672
It's magical in here,
isn't it?

01:02:06.342 --> 01:02:08.676
I miss the feeling.

01:02:11.113 --> 01:02:13.880
Well. Wanna mark
through the <i> pas?</i>

01:02:16.719 --> 01:02:19.019
Let's do it.

01:02:43.078 --> 01:02:45.045
Well, this is awkward.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.415
Why? It's only been
eight years.

01:02:51.153 --> 01:02:53.887
- Shall we start from the top?
- Yeah.

01:02:53.922 --> 01:02:57.224
OK.

(tender piano music)

01:03:13.909 --> 01:03:16.943

And a million pirouettes.

01:03:16.979 --> 01:03:19.446
Nice.

01:03:21.083 --> 01:03:22.949
Ow! Ow!

01:03:23.018 --> 01:03:25.319
- Did I hit you?!
- Yeah.

01:03:25.388 --> 01:03:27.254
- Are you OK?
- Oh, it's fine.

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:29.290
I'm totally fired.

01:03:29.358 --> 01:03:32.426
It wasn't your fault.

01:03:32.461 --> 01:03:35.729
Umm... Let's try
the diagonal.

01:03:45.107 --> 01:03:47.974
(gentle music speeds up
and orchestra comes in)

01:03:58.421 --> 01:04:01.488
(emotional music)

01:04:18.874 --> 01:04:20.841
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you've been dancing

01:04:20.876 --> 01:04:23.444
alone every night
in the gym around 11.

01:04:23.479 --> 01:04:25.946
- (scoffing)
- And if I didn't know

01:04:25.981 --> 01:04:29.483
any better, I'd think
you'd been spying on me!

01:04:29.518 --> 01:04:31.918
You know, there are dancers
who would pay a lot of money

01:04:31.987 --> 01:04:34.187
- to have you coach them.
- Yeah. I don't think

01:04:34.256 --> 01:04:36.657
any of them live
in Marietta, Georgia.

01:04:36.726 --> 01:04:38.625
I'm not saying you should
do it in Georgia.

01:04:38.661 --> 01:04:42.663
- Oh. Tennessee?
- Hmmm. A little further north.

01:04:42.698 --> 01:04:46.032
- Kentucky?
- Higher.

01:04:46.068 --> 01:04:48.869
- Oh, I know. Maryland.
- Uh-huh.

01:04:53.108 --> 01:04:55.041
I can't even think
about that right now.

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:57.878
I just need to get through
Saturday night and...

01:05:00.082 --> 01:05:02.883
What's wrong?

01:05:02.951 --> 01:05:05.218
I mean, it's one thing
to rehearse Sugar Plum...

01:05:05.254 --> 01:05:08.522
It's a whole other thing
to perform in front of

01:05:08.591 --> 01:05:11.892
an actual live audience.
That's...

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.227
a little scary.

01:05:16.932 --> 01:05:19.666
- Hold that thought.
- Where are you going?

01:05:19.702 --> 01:05:23.003
Hey. Can you guys
turn it up a little bit?

01:05:23.038 --> 01:05:25.606
- What are you doing?
- Come on! What do you say?

01:05:25.674 --> 01:05:28.108
- (Latin music)
- No!

01:05:28.176 --> 01:05:30.377
- Come on. Come join me.
- Right here?

01:05:30.413 --> 01:05:34.047
- Yeah!
- Oh... OK...

01:05:34.082 --> 01:05:36.683
Get those hips working.

01:05:36.719 --> 01:05:40.053
Now we're talking.

01:05:40.088 --> 01:05:43.023
That's not so bad.

01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:51.698
(crowd exclaiming)

01:06:11.153 --> 01:06:13.854
You're a natural!

01:06:25.033 --> 01:06:27.534
Yeah!

01:06:39.515 --> 01:06:42.148
(crowd clapping and cheering)

01:06:44.386 --> 01:06:47.087
Stage fright, huh?

01:06:49.124 --> 01:06:51.024
Let's go
from the <i> développé.</i>

01:06:51.093 --> 01:06:53.193
Alright.

01:07:00.803 --> 01:07:03.036
Not like that.

01:07:03.105 --> 01:07:04.872
Mark's the director, Darren.

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:08.642
Make sure you're far enough
from him that you can get

01:07:08.677 --> 01:07:11.077
that nice bend
in your back. Last time.

01:07:19.955 --> 01:07:22.322
- Is that what you're gonna do?
- Well, if you're gonna hold me

01:07:22.357 --> 01:07:24.791
- like that, I think I have to.
- Alright.

01:07:24.827 --> 01:07:28.662
Let's leave this for now,
move on to the next section.

01:07:31.734 --> 01:07:33.667
This production is
falling apart.

01:07:33.702 --> 01:07:35.836
I'm going to speak to the board
about having him replaced

01:07:35.905 --> 01:07:38.038
- after it's over.
- Hold on a second. No,

01:07:38.106 --> 01:07:41.041
the production is not falling
apart. And Mark is actually

01:07:41.076 --> 01:07:43.644
the only one who's
keeping this thing going.

01:07:43.679 --> 01:07:46.046
First, her niece gets
the role of Clara,

01:07:46.114 --> 01:07:48.348
and now Lily
as the Sugar Plum Fairy?

01:07:48.417 --> 01:07:51.518
I'm sorry.
I'm not buying it!

01:07:55.617 --> 01:07:58.438
I know! I'm pinching myself
that Sadie and I get to dance...

01:07:58.488 --> 01:07:59.686
on the same stage together.

01:07:59.754 --> 01:08:01.988
- And Mark?
- [He's changed, Mom.]

01:08:02.057 --> 01:08:04.991
And yet, he hasn't changed
at all. You know what I mean?

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:08.548
Well, it sounds like maybe
you've changed a little, too.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:11.918
Maybe. It's been
the strangest few days.

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:14.320
But in a good way.

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:17.057
Sounds great.
Now, aren't you glad

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:20.060
you listened to your wise old
mother for a change?

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:22.228
- Yes, Momma.
- [So,]

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:24.765
[when are you seeing Mark next?]

01:08:24.832 --> 01:08:27.533
I asked him to Christmas
dinner to our place.

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:30.336
I was thinking I'd make
my holiday shepherd's pie.

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:33.540
Only if you're trying
to get rid of him.

01:08:48.243 --> 01:08:51.345
What's going on?

01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:53.546
- No one told you?
- Told me what?

01:08:53.582 --> 01:08:55.716
I forgave Mark for his
temporary lack of judgement,

01:08:55.751 --> 01:08:58.285
- and came back to do the show.
- You forgave Mark.

01:08:58.321 --> 01:09:00.487
You didn't really think
Mark would choose you over me

01:09:00.555 --> 01:09:02.890
as Sugar Plum?

01:09:12.501 --> 01:09:14.768
Hey! Where are you going?

01:09:14.837 --> 01:09:16.970
I can't believe you did this
to me again.

01:09:17.038 --> 01:09:19.907
- What are you talking about?
- I trusted you.

01:09:19.942 --> 01:09:22.042
Lily, wait!

01:09:22.078 --> 01:09:24.879
What happened?

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:33.671
Juliette?!

01:09:33.721 --> 01:09:34.955
Hey Mark! I called Juliette last night--

01:09:35.024 --> 01:09:38.259
- Hold on. What are you doing here?
- You were right. I overreacted.

01:09:38.294 --> 01:09:41.929
- But the good news is, I'm back!
- No. You don't get to walk out

01:09:41.964 --> 01:09:44.198
on everybody then stroll back in
the day before the show.

01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:45.843
You need to leave. Now.

01:09:45.893 --> 01:09:47.067
- Hold on, Mark--
- Not now, Darren.

01:09:47.103 --> 01:09:49.095
You quit the company,
and you've been replaced.

01:09:49.145 --> 01:09:49.736
Wait a second--

01:09:49.772 --> 01:09:52.839
Darren! I'm not asking
for your opinion!

01:09:52.908 --> 01:09:56.510
OK, how about this?
She goes, I go.

01:10:15.231 --> 01:10:17.831
(knocking)

01:10:21.437 --> 01:10:24.805
Lily!
(knocking)

01:10:34.183 --> 01:10:36.383
(cell phone rings)

01:11:03.145 --> 01:11:06.246
Aren't you that dancer
from Marietta, Georgia?

01:11:06.315 --> 01:11:08.215
What are you doing here?

01:11:08.284 --> 01:11:10.317
I've been looking everywhere.
I need to explain something--

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:12.552
Mark, listen.
I can't go through this.

01:11:12.588 --> 01:11:15.922
- I fired Juliette.
- What?

01:11:15.992 --> 01:11:18.058
Truth is, I never hired
her back. I don't know why

01:11:18.127 --> 01:11:20.861
she thought she could just
walk back in like that.

01:11:23.199 --> 01:11:24.898
Wow. I really thought--

01:11:24.967 --> 01:11:29.069
You thought I was pulling
the rug out again. I get it.

01:11:29.138 --> 01:11:31.205
This time, I'm not
letting you walk away.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.574
Not from the show
and not from me.

01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:36.810
Look, I can't
change the past,

01:11:36.845 --> 01:11:39.880
but I can offer you
a future here together.

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:44.084
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying most people only

01:11:44.153 --> 01:11:48.022
get one chance, but we're
getting two. Let's get it right!

01:11:48.057 --> 01:11:52.059
- But my life's back in Georgia.
- Your life is here.

01:11:53.729 --> 01:11:55.962
Lily, we both know
you should be back in ballet.

01:11:55.998 --> 01:11:59.599
Dancing, teaching,
doing what you love...

01:12:02.004 --> 01:12:04.438
Come on. This is
the city of love.

01:12:04.507 --> 01:12:07.908
Actually, that's Paris.
Philly's the city

01:12:07.976 --> 01:12:10.210
of brotherly love.
It's a little bit different.

01:12:10.246 --> 01:12:14.214
Whatever.

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:16.750
So, what do you say?

01:12:20.022 --> 01:12:22.756
I say we get through
opening night

01:12:22.791 --> 01:12:26.226
before we make
any crazy plans.

01:12:26.262 --> 01:12:28.228
Yeah.

01:12:28.264 --> 01:12:31.498
About opening night...
When I fired Juliette,

01:12:31.534 --> 01:12:33.600
Darren left
with her. So,

01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:35.969
we've lost
our prince as well.

01:12:36.038 --> 01:12:39.106
- What?
- Yeah. If I cancel the show,

01:12:39.141 --> 01:12:42.676
I'll never direct again.
On the other hand,

01:12:42.744 --> 01:12:45.245
I don't have
any other options.

01:12:45.281 --> 01:12:47.514
Yes you do!

01:12:47.583 --> 01:12:49.983
I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

01:12:50.018 --> 01:12:52.286
Lily, but there's nobody else
in the company who can be ready

01:12:52.321 --> 01:12:54.521
- by tomorrow night.
- I'm not talking about

01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:58.092
anyone else in the company!
You know every step, every turn.

01:12:58.127 --> 01:13:01.395
- You can do every lift.
- Me?! No way.

01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:05.665
Do you ever want
to direct again?

01:13:05.701 --> 01:13:09.769
You're the one who just said
we were getting a second chance.

01:13:09.805 --> 01:13:12.806
Yeah, a second chance with us,
not me dancing!

01:13:14.477 --> 01:13:18.345
- Why not both?
- I need to think about it.

01:13:18.414 --> 01:13:20.514
There's no time
to think about it!

01:13:20.583 --> 01:13:23.683
- This is the only option!
- What if it doesn't work?

01:13:23.719 --> 01:13:26.220
Then you'll have a great story
to tell your friends

01:13:26.288 --> 01:13:29.223
- at the post office.
- Post office?

01:13:29.258 --> 01:13:32.493
In your next career.

01:13:35.131 --> 01:13:37.664
So, are you in
or you out?

01:13:45.006 --> 01:13:48.207
(Tchaikovsky's
Nutcracker March plays)

01:13:53.247 --> 01:13:56.148
There you are.
Be at places in five.

01:14:11.865 --> 01:14:15.935
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please
be seated. The performance is</i>

01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:18.637
<i>about to begin.</i>

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.900
(music crescendos)

01:14:50.871 --> 01:14:53.538
(drums imitate ripping sound)

01:14:53.574 --> 01:14:56.342
(tragic music)

01:15:17.198 --> 01:15:20.199
(fast bells chime in)

01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:51.130
(applause)

01:16:03.911 --> 01:16:06.512
(Boom!)
(crowd exclaims)

01:16:35.909 --> 01:16:38.377
(war style music)

01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:46.585
(gentle harp)

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:09.208
(quiet, magical music)

01:17:37.638 --> 01:17:41.039
(tragic music building)

01:18:02.263 --> 01:18:06.097
(dramatic timpani)

01:18:22.516 --> 01:18:24.949
(applause)

01:18:34.695 --> 01:18:36.628
Sadie?!

01:18:36.697 --> 01:18:38.664
Have you seen Sadie?

01:18:38.732 --> 01:18:41.166
- Sadie!
- Hi!

01:18:41.235 --> 01:18:44.269
- Am I doing OK?
- OK? You are amazing!

01:18:44.305 --> 01:18:46.572
You're doing so good!

01:18:46.607 --> 01:18:49.007
So I know it's just Act One
and I'm really not supposed to

01:18:49.042 --> 01:18:52.744
be back here, but Sadie, you are
so wonderful, you really are!

01:18:52.779 --> 01:18:55.980
Thank you!

01:18:56.016 --> 01:18:58.650
I have been coming
to this Nutcracker

01:18:58.719 --> 01:19:02.287
performance for the last
nine years. Sadie,

01:19:02.323 --> 01:19:06.692
you danced Clara
like nobody I have ever seen!

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.594
It was just breathtaking.

01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:10.795
Thank you so much!
That means the world.

01:19:10.831 --> 01:19:13.432
And I'm going to recommend
to the board that they not only

01:19:13.467 --> 01:19:16.668
offer this young lady a full
scholarship at our school,

01:19:16.737 --> 01:19:20.038
but that they beg you
to stay on in some capacity.

01:19:20.107 --> 01:19:22.841
Because we need you here, Lily.

01:19:22.909 --> 01:19:24.843
Thank you!

01:19:24.911 --> 01:19:28.580
- Good luck. Have fun!
- Thank you!

01:19:31.318 --> 01:19:34.486
What?

01:19:34.521 --> 01:19:36.187
You're nervous about the lift.

01:19:36.257 --> 01:19:38.490
We need to run it again.

01:19:39.511 --> 01:19:42.279
OK.

01:19:42.314 --> 01:19:45.048
No, wait, wait!
Sorry. I wasn't ready.

01:19:46.852 --> 01:19:49.819
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:19:52.791 --> 01:19:57.427
Ah! OK. I can feel the tension
in your arms. You have to relax.

01:19:57.463 --> 01:20:00.297
That's easy
for you to say.

01:20:00.332 --> 01:20:04.968
What? If you have a suggestion,
I wanna hear it.

01:20:05.003 --> 01:20:07.771
You told me
not to direct anyone.

01:20:07.806 --> 01:20:09.404
The no-directing rule
doesn't apply right now.

01:20:09.454 --> 01:20:11.141
I'm directing you to direct, quickly!

01:20:11.176 --> 01:20:13.577
Fine. I think you're lunging
a little too far forward

01:20:13.612 --> 01:20:16.380
and Aunt Lily, you're just
hesitating. Commit to the lift!

01:20:16.448 --> 01:20:18.815
- So it's his fault?
- So it's her fault?

01:20:18.850 --> 01:20:21.251
You guys,
just remember:

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:24.488
One <i> plié</i> at a time.

01:20:24.523 --> 01:20:26.823
- You've got this.
- Thanks.

01:20:26.858 --> 01:20:29.826
Mark.

01:20:29.861 --> 01:20:33.497
Look at me.

01:20:33.532 --> 01:20:36.900
I love you.

01:20:36.968 --> 01:20:41.971
I know you can do this.

01:20:42.007 --> 01:20:45.342
I know we can do this.

01:20:56.855 --> 01:21:00.890
