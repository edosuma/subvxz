00:34.004 --> 00:35.080
Please!

00:38.044 --> 00:40.023
I'm sorry, Geoffrey.

00:40.024 --> 00:42.044
I'm not the man for this. Michael...

00:42.045 --> 00:43.072
I can't do it!

00:46.060 --> 00:47.091
I'm sorry.

00:47.092 --> 00:50.062
Wait! Michael...
I'll find you someone else.

00:50.063 --> 00:53.024
Just tell me what happened.
Thank you, Alice.

01:02.084 --> 01:04.052
Oh, it'll be all right.

01:56.092 --> 01:59.087
I think her father is
experimenting on her!

01:59.088 --> 02:02.043
You little... Oh, Father!

02:02.044 --> 02:05.068
Apple a day, Mrs McCarthy.
The cheek of it!

02:11.091 --> 02:12.151
Katie...

02:16.079 --> 02:18.139
You're supposed to be her friend!

02:18.140 --> 02:20.171
She hasn't got the plague!

02:22.099 --> 02:23.127
Mrs Bennett...

02:26.143 --> 02:29.099
Mrs Bennett... Ruth...

02:30.171 --> 02:33.134
I find this response mystifying.

02:33.135 --> 02:36.143
Mmm. Well, their ignorance
isn't your responsibility.

02:36.144 --> 02:40.082
Father. That child is afflicted!

02:40.083 --> 02:43.123
Yes, well,
we're all afflicted, Mrs McCarthy.

02:43.124 --> 02:48.098
No, no. She has the atomic bomb
sickness. You must keep away.

02:48.099 --> 02:50.145
Truth and rumour,
in my experience,

02:50.146 --> 02:52.143
are not one and the same thing.

02:52.144 --> 02:56.138
So why did Dr Evans
walk out on them?

02:56.139 --> 02:59.078
Last night. Giving no reason.

02:59.079 --> 03:03.098
Everyone knows
she goes in to that atomic place.

03:03.099 --> 03:06.155
She's one of their... what do you
call them... human hamsters.

03:06.156 --> 03:10.094
If Ruth Bennett visits
Mr Bennett's place of work,

03:10.095 --> 03:12.095
I am sure that it is perfectly safe.

03:12.096 --> 03:15.090
Then why has
Mr Bennett become sterile?

03:15.091 --> 03:19.111
Oh, think about it, Father.
Only the one child.

03:36.135 --> 03:38.155
Medium wrench please, Bob.

03:41.123 --> 03:42.154
Thank you, Bob.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.159
Ruth, dear.
Leave the poor man alone. >

03:44.160 --> 03:48.082
You leave her alone, Geoffrey.
She's doing a fine job.

03:48.083 --> 03:49.123
Aren't you, Bob?

03:54.139 --> 03:57.150
Ah, Mr. Bennett. Father!

03:57.151 --> 04:00.083
I wonder if I might have a word
with you and Mrs Bennett?

04:03.155 --> 04:06.078
I could come back later...

04:06.079 --> 04:07.087
Please.

04:09.143 --> 04:11.083
Hello, Ruth.

04:12.115 --> 04:15.114
Ah, Douglas. Father.

04:15.115 --> 04:17.094
Taking it easy, I see.

04:17.095 --> 04:20.084
He who fitted the pipes
must fix the leaks.

04:20.086 --> 04:23.095
I think you've made that one up.
Have you been to the hospital yet?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.146
No, he hasn't.

04:24.147 --> 04:28.147
They don't want to be bothered
with me. Anyway, I'm almost done.

04:28.148 --> 04:30.114
Thanks to Bob.

04:30.115 --> 04:33.101
You're a stubborn fool, Douglas.
Mm. I'll get Emily.

04:33.102 --> 04:34.163
Please, come through.

04:40.127 --> 04:43.078
Hello. Again.

04:43.079 --> 04:47.082
Your husband and Douglas,
comrades-in-arms, I see.

04:47.083 --> 04:50.131
Douglas saved his life.
Three times. Please.

04:53.135 --> 04:56.127
And the debt has been paid
many times over.

04:56.128 --> 05:00.074
Douglas is a very good man.
But a terrible plumber.

05:00.075 --> 05:01.150
Oh, dear.

05:01.151 --> 05:04.114
So... here to round up
some lost sheep?

05:04.115 --> 05:08.098
Atomic physics and telepathy.
What talents!

05:08.099 --> 05:10.155
I would love to have you all
back at St Mary's.

05:10.156 --> 05:12.098
But that's not why I'm here.

05:12.099 --> 05:16.090
I have heard that Dr Evans
is no longer working with you.

05:16.091 --> 05:17.129
That is correct.

05:17.130 --> 05:20.119
His departure has fanned
the flames of village gossip,

05:20.120 --> 05:26.074
which I do not believe for a minute.
However, many do. And?

05:26.075 --> 05:29.133
There is a meeting of
the Atomic Emergency Committee

05:29.134 --> 05:31.105
this evening in the Parish Hall.

05:31.106 --> 05:33.165
I happen to know
they do not have a speaker.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.167
And I thought...
Let me stop you there.

05:35.168 --> 05:40.130
My enthusiasm for Parish
involvement has faded recently.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.094
Which I understand.

05:42.095 --> 05:44.170
So what better opportunity

05:44.171 --> 05:48.162
for you to address
villagers' concerns directly?

05:48.163 --> 05:52.083
I will ensure
that they turn up in numbers.

05:56.111 --> 06:00.095
Hurry along, there.
Take your seats, please.

06:03.075 --> 06:05.153
'I understand why Kembleford
and other places'

06:05.154 --> 06:09.151
have set up committees like this.
These are terrifying times.

06:09.152 --> 06:14.150
Fear of a Soviet atomic attack
seems unavoidable.

06:14.151 --> 06:17.154
Paranoia about radiation is not.

06:17.155 --> 06:20.162
As I hope I've just demonstrated,

06:20.163 --> 06:24.150
radiation is essentially
the act of giving off energy.

06:24.151 --> 06:28.078
It is an entirely natural process.

06:28.079 --> 06:30.094
This instrument will tell us

06:30.095 --> 06:35.099
the level of background
radiation in this room.

06:36.127 --> 06:40.087
Oh, it seems we have a
radioactive source amongst us.

06:41.115 --> 06:46.087
There's no need to...
Please, it's very weak.

06:53.139 --> 06:57.079
Ah, may I have your necklace
for a moment?

07:02.091 --> 07:08.134
Cloisonne jewellery. Known to give
off harmless, low-level radiation.

07:08.135 --> 07:13.154
Now. The atomic centre I work in
has a background radiation level

07:13.155 --> 07:17.083
of less than half what is
given off by this necklace.

07:18.163 --> 07:22.170
I hope that, er, reassures you.

07:22.171 --> 07:24.170
Thank you.

07:24.171 --> 07:29.158
Oh, and I would like to donate this
Geiger counter to your committee.

07:29.159 --> 07:33.155
I hope you, er, find it enlightening.

07:37.099 --> 07:39.166
Thank you, Mr Bennett.

07:39.167 --> 07:44.106
I understand you're trying
to bamboozle us with science.

07:44.107 --> 07:46.138
Yes!

07:46.139 --> 07:48.114
But it won't work.

07:48.115 --> 07:50.118
Why did Dr Evans quit?

07:50.119 --> 07:52.146
Mrs. McCarthy...

07:52.147 --> 07:53.167
Mr. Bennett?

07:56.083 --> 07:59.147
Dr Evans left our employ
for personal reasons.

08:00.163 --> 08:03.127
Why do you take your daughter
to work with you?

08:03.128 --> 08:05.094
This is not the time.

08:05.095 --> 08:08.118
Please answer the question,
Mr Bennett.

08:08.119 --> 08:12.074
They were studying
radioactivity in her class.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.091
Look, let me make this
simple for you.

08:14.092 --> 08:18.074
My daughter does not have
a radiation sickness.

08:18.075 --> 08:19.147
What does she have?

08:23.079 --> 08:24.083
We don't know.

08:25.127 --> 08:27.078
This is absurd.

08:27.079 --> 08:30.083
You can show us
all the fancy drawings you like.

08:30.084 --> 08:32.162
Mrs McCarthy, that is enough!

08:32.163 --> 08:35.134
But this community
will not sleep easy,

08:35.135 --> 08:38.130
until your daughter
leaves Kembleford.

08:38.131 --> 08:39.169
Here, here.

08:39.171 --> 08:41.075
What?

08:43.159 --> 08:46.151
Imbeciles. Every last one of them.
Mr Bennett...

08:53.131 --> 08:55.078
It's beautiful.

08:55.079 --> 08:57.095
It's worth a few bob, too, I reckon.

08:59.103 --> 09:02.134
I'll take that, thank you very much.

09:02.135 --> 09:04.159
Trying to buy us off with a trinket.

09:08.103 --> 09:11.099
It could prove a useful gift,
when you think about it.

09:12.103 --> 09:16.078
What on earth did Geoffrey Bennett
do to deserve that?

09:16.079 --> 09:19.110
Book of Numbers, chapter five.

09:19.111 --> 09:22.167
"Command the Children of Israel,
that they cast out of the camp

09:22.168 --> 09:27.082
"every leper and whosoever
hath an issue of seed."

09:27.083 --> 09:31.134
Ruth Bennett is not a leper and that
was unchristian.

09:31.135 --> 09:35.082
It was insensitive,
intolerant and it was judgmental.

09:35.083 --> 09:38.119
And I am VERY disappointed.

09:49.159 --> 09:52.159
We have to protect her. >
It's the ultimate betrayal! >

09:52.160 --> 09:55.090
But we need to make
her life bearable! >

09:55.091 --> 09:56.127
'Where is she?'

10:04.099 --> 10:06.150
Ruth? What happened?

10:06.151 --> 10:09.082
Please keep them away from me.

10:09.083 --> 10:12.078
Why? They're monsters.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.154
Ruth? Ruth!

10:13.155 --> 10:17.103
Can I speak with you tomorrow?
Tell me what happened, now.

10:17.104 --> 10:20.122
I'll come in the morning. 11 o'clock.

10:20.123 --> 10:22.083
I'll be at St Mary's.

10:24.107 --> 10:28.078
Father. I came to apologise
about the meeting.

10:28.079 --> 10:30.074
Oh. No need.

10:30.075 --> 10:32.114
Ruth seems a little upset.

10:32.115 --> 10:36.126
It's been a tiring day for her.
Come back inside, Ruth.

10:36.127 --> 10:37.287
Come on. There's a good girl.

10:45.139 --> 10:46.151
Anything I can do?

10:46.152 --> 10:49.095
I think we'll be fine, Father.
Thank you.

11:15.139 --> 11:17.138
There you are.

11:17.139 --> 11:20.075
Your last cup
got cold waiting for you.

11:21.163 --> 11:23.134
About last night...

11:23.135 --> 11:26.091
I'm not the person
you should be apologising to.

11:27.147 --> 11:28.151
I have to go.

11:35.143 --> 11:39.126
Did they not say
how long they'd be gone? No.

11:39.127 --> 11:41.165
I presume they took Ruth with them?

11:41.166 --> 11:44.101
I'm afraid Miss Bennett
is having a lie down.

11:44.102 --> 11:46.167
She can't be disturbed. Oh, I see.

11:46.168 --> 11:51.134
Then, erm, I'll just wait
till Mr and Mrs Bennett return.

11:51.135 --> 11:52.171
As you like.

12:02.163 --> 12:04.143
Ruth?

12:06.115 --> 12:08.075
Ruth!

12:24.075 --> 12:26.166
Mr Bennett and Mrs Bennett!

12:26.167 --> 12:28.107
What are you doing?

12:37.095 --> 12:39.145
Last night, Ruth said
she wanted to talk to me.

12:39.146 --> 12:42.147
When she didn't turn up this
morning, I became worried.

12:42.148 --> 12:45.142
I couldn't help noticing...
She's gone.

12:45.143 --> 12:48.090
She disappeared last night.

12:48.091 --> 12:51.106
Oh. We've been out looking for her.

12:51.107 --> 12:55.167
But, well, she hasn't been
herself for the past couple of days.

12:55.168 --> 12:58.122
Dr Evans leaving
has hit her very hard.

12:58.123 --> 13:01.171
Is that why she was so upset
last night? Yes.

13:01.172 --> 13:04.091
Have you called the police?

13:05.095 --> 13:07.123
I'm calling them, Geoffrey.

13:10.163 --> 13:12.143
Shall I put the ladder away?

13:15.103 --> 13:19.091
No I'll leave it where it is.

13:20.123 --> 13:23.082
So, you think she might
have run away

13:23.083 --> 13:25.075
because she was
scared of the village?

13:25.076 --> 13:26.119
Yes.

13:28.147 --> 13:31.159
And she locked herself in here
at around 10pm?

13:33.131 --> 13:34.138
Yes.

13:34.139 --> 13:37.171
And it was only when you broke in
at 8.30 this morning,

13:37.172 --> 13:39.122
that you knew she was gone?

13:39.123 --> 13:42.115
We were sure we'd find her.
That's why we didn't call you.

13:49.123 --> 13:51.119
What was she wearing last night?

13:51.120 --> 13:55.090
Er, pyjamas. White pyjamas...

13:55.091 --> 13:59.098
with a little mouse
embroidered on the front.

13:59.099 --> 14:02.118
They're not here, I've checked.

14:02.119 --> 14:06.154
What else did she take?
Er, just a blue pullover.

14:06.155 --> 14:09.094
That's why we're sure
she hasn't gone far.

14:09.095 --> 14:11.114
Have you tried her friends?

14:11.115 --> 14:14.119
Her "friends"
won't go near her at the moment.

14:15.135 --> 14:19.154
Can you think of anyone else
she might have gone to?

14:19.155 --> 14:22.139
No-one who wouldn't have told us
right away.

14:24.127 --> 14:26.135
Well, we'll get looking.

14:29.095 --> 14:32.107
In the vast majority of cases
like this, the child turns up

14:32.108 --> 14:36.107
of their own accord,
perfectly unharmed, within 24 hours.

14:38.099 --> 14:39.115
I'll see myself out.

14:49.095 --> 14:51.167
My only sacred text is
the Hippocratic Oath.

14:57.123 --> 15:01.122
Actually, I'm here because
Ruth Bennett has disappeared.

15:01.123 --> 15:04.094
She hasn't been seen
since last night.

15:04.095 --> 15:06.094
What time? Sorry?

15:06.095 --> 15:08.158
What time was she last seen?

15:08.159 --> 15:10.151
I gather, about 10pm.

15:13.091 --> 15:16.117
I don't suppose you could shed
any light on her state of mind?

15:16.118 --> 15:19.115
Nothing that you won't get
from Geoffrey and Emily.

15:19.116 --> 15:23.151
Her father mentioned
she was rather hurt by your leaving.

15:25.155 --> 15:28.163
Can I ask why you did walk away?
I felt guilty.

15:28.164 --> 15:33.102
I'd been flailing around, trying to
diagnose her for more than a year.

15:33.103 --> 15:35.119
How long has she had the condition?

15:35.120 --> 15:37.098
Since she was a small child.

15:37.099 --> 15:40.115
So your failure to diagnose
is hardly a crime?

15:45.127 --> 15:48.147
May I, er, have a look?

15:55.079 --> 15:57.138
From a contact in Southampton.

15:57.139 --> 16:00.154
Males with the same condition
as Ruth.

16:00.155 --> 16:02.142
All males?

16:02.143 --> 16:06.102
Industrial workers,
mostly shipping or railways.

16:06.103 --> 16:08.130
Middle-aged or over.

16:08.131 --> 16:11.094
No overlap with Ruth whatsoever.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.107
Have the Bennetts seen these?

16:14.171 --> 16:16.130
They arrived this morning.

16:16.131 --> 16:21.111
Ruth's have more of a formation
to them. I can't explain that.

16:24.127 --> 16:26.110
How are these men now?

16:26.111 --> 16:31.087
Dead. Most of them, anyway.
Unexplained lung cancer.

16:32.111 --> 16:34.155
I won't tell Geoffrey and Emily.

16:34.156 --> 16:36.079
Not now.

16:38.139 --> 16:41.154
Did you visit the Bennetts
last night?

16:41.155 --> 16:43.083
No.

16:44.131 --> 16:47.111
Then why did you ask what time
Ruth disappeared?

16:49.131 --> 16:51.087
I was concerned.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.103
Where is she?

17:01.135 --> 17:04.165
Geoffrey... Where is she? Who?

17:04.166 --> 17:06.155
Don't you dare play
silly beggars with me.

17:06.156 --> 17:08.078
Ruth? Ruth!

17:08.079 --> 17:11.079
I would tell you if she was here.

17:12.111 --> 17:14.102
I will help you find her.

17:14.103 --> 17:15.151
You stay away from my family.

17:15.152 --> 17:18.098
I can't. Not now.

17:20.075 --> 17:21.127
When last did you see her?

17:22.131 --> 17:24.159
I mean it.
Just tell me how long...

18:22.123 --> 18:24.162
Father! Father!

18:24.163 --> 18:28.078
I find Ruth. Behind door.

18:28.079 --> 18:30.159
The machine, it goes crazy.
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.118
You little thief!

18:32.119 --> 18:37.082
It belong to village.
It BELONG to the Committee.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.149
I must show Father where she is.

18:39.150 --> 18:43.133
He is far too busy here to listen
to your wild imaginings.

18:43.134 --> 18:47.127
We should at least take a look.
Don't you think, Mrs McCarthy?

18:47.128 --> 18:48.143
Yes!

18:55.107 --> 18:57.075
She's there.

19:00.091 --> 19:03.075
Oh.

19:07.123 --> 19:09.126
Ha!

19:09.127 --> 19:12.074
Maybe you heard a woodpecker, Susie.

19:12.075 --> 19:15.086
Before there was something funny,
I swear.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.139
I believe you, Susie.

19:24.087 --> 19:25.099
Hello.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.135
Father wants to talk to
you about some job.

19:30.136 --> 19:33.094
Right. What's wrong with you?

19:33.095 --> 19:36.086
I find Ruth. Eh? In little house.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.082
But then she go again and now

19:38.083 --> 19:41.079
Father Brown and Mrs McCarthy,
they think I'm crazy.

19:42.111 --> 19:45.082
You need cheering up. Da-dah!

19:45.083 --> 19:48.078
Uh? Not bad, are they?

19:48.079 --> 19:51.073
Almost half the people in this camp
have bought some already.

19:51.074 --> 19:54.109
I do not want my hands
on your stolen object, thank you.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.149
Hey! There's nothing stolen here.

19:56.150 --> 19:59.151
They were going to be thrown out.
Honestly, you have my word.

19:59.152 --> 20:02.107
Go on... it won't bite.

20:05.123 --> 20:07.159
Oh, look at that! It suits you.

20:07.160 --> 20:10.078
It's a plate!

20:10.079 --> 20:13.105
Right, they're a shilling each.
Four for three shillings.

20:13.106 --> 20:15.135
Not that
you'd be interested, obviously.

20:15.136 --> 20:18.098
You've made that quite clear.

20:18.099 --> 20:20.114
Keep your money.

20:20.115 --> 20:21.147
Cook me dinner.

20:28.151 --> 20:30.122
Since I have four plates,

20:30.123 --> 20:33.119
I can invite Mrs McCarthy
and Father Brown, too?

20:33.120 --> 20:34.151
Yes?

20:36.095 --> 20:38.075
Lovely

20:45.103 --> 20:48.151
Quite a turnout. Yes, especially
from those at your meeting.

20:48.152 --> 20:53.086
Yes, well, if their guilt leads you
to your daughter, will you mind?

20:53.087 --> 20:54.147
No, of course not.

20:54.148 --> 20:59.086
Douglas and Ruth seemed very close
when I saw them yesterday.

20:59.087 --> 21:00.135
What makes you say that?

21:04.075 --> 21:06.075
Both outsiders of a sort, I suppose.

21:07.127 --> 21:10.086
Excuse me. Father Brown!

21:10.087 --> 21:12.090
Father...

21:12.091 --> 21:15.103
Group of us...
we found these near Foley Bridge.

21:17.099 --> 21:18.169
This was dated yesterday.

21:18.170 --> 21:22.103
Why the silly girl was writing love
letters to herself, I have no idea.

21:22.104 --> 21:24.166
But, it's a clue...

21:24.167 --> 21:27.151
Yes, well maybe you should have...
Inspector!

21:27.152 --> 21:29.075
Left them there.

21:30.159 --> 21:32.151
"Dear M E..."

21:34.131 --> 21:36.075
How slow of me!

22:17.079 --> 22:19.074
Dr Michael Evans? Yes?

22:19.075 --> 22:21.129
We'd like to question you
about your possible involvement

22:21.130 --> 22:23.135
in the disappearance
of Ruth Bennett.

22:26.107 --> 22:28.117
How long are you going
to keep me here?

22:28.118 --> 22:30.105
Let me put you out of your misery.

22:30.106 --> 22:33.151
Your relationship with Ruth
Bennett. Tell me about it.

22:33.152 --> 22:37.086
She was my patient.
There's really nothing more to say.

22:37.087 --> 22:38.129
Typical patient, was she?

22:38.130 --> 22:41.163
Her condition was not.
But my relationship with her was.

22:46.107 --> 22:48.082
"You are right, Michael.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.097
"We must have the courage
to follow our hearts.

22:50.098 --> 22:52.081
"When you say the word,
I will come to you

22:52.082 --> 22:54.095
"and we shall finally be free.

22:54.096 --> 23:00.074
"In anticipation, your beloved Ruth.
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss."

23:00.075 --> 23:02.074
I've never seen this.

23:02.075 --> 23:04.097
The pieces were found
near the river,

23:04.098 --> 23:06.119
less than 100 yards from your house.

23:11.111 --> 23:13.138
Is there any news?

23:13.139 --> 23:16.147
I understand Inspector Valentine
is still with Dr Evans.

23:24.131 --> 23:26.154
What fools we've been.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.106
This is not your fault.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.142
Of course it is.

23:30.143 --> 23:33.138
I spotted the crush months ago.

23:33.139 --> 23:37.146
"Just a stage".
That's what I said to Geoffrey.

23:37.147 --> 23:42.151
Neither of us wanted to scare
off such a marvellous doctor.

23:44.083 --> 23:48.118
We trusted him.
You don't yet know what's happened.

23:48.119 --> 23:51.078
You've not seen Ruth's diary.

23:51.079 --> 23:53.139
My daughter...

23:55.095 --> 23:57.143
is not the child
I thought she was.

23:59.091 --> 24:02.171
Did you know Ruth Bennett had a
crush on you? No, I did not.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.074
"November 4th.

24:09.075 --> 24:11.097
"This morning,
Michael locked the door

24:11.098 --> 24:13.121
"and sat down next to me
on the bed.

24:13.122 --> 24:15.117
"My heart has never beaten faster.

24:15.118 --> 24:18.165
"He smiled and said,
'Are you sure about this?' I nodded.

24:18.166 --> 24:21.107
"He brushed hair away from my eyes
and then,

24:21.108 --> 24:24.110
"then, dear diary, he kissed me.

24:24.111 --> 24:27.110
"This grown man kissed me."

24:27.111 --> 24:29.086
While you were in that cell,

24:29.087 --> 24:32.091
this was found under
a floorboard in Ruth's bedroom.

24:32.092 --> 24:34.134
200 pages going back months.

24:34.135 --> 24:37.115
And it gets a lot more racy
than that, I can tell you.

24:39.075 --> 24:42.074
Her place. Your place.

24:42.075 --> 24:43.097
Her place again...

24:43.098 --> 24:44.143
Stupid, stupid girl.

24:46.087 --> 24:47.139
What happened last night?

24:50.111 --> 24:52.154
OK... Michael Evans,

24:52.155 --> 24:55.113
I am arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Ruth Bennett.

24:55.114 --> 24:57.129
You are not obliged to say
anything... Please...

24:57.130 --> 25:00.075
unless you wish to do so,
but whatever you say will be...

25:00.076 --> 25:02.095
All right! I'll tell you.

25:05.131 --> 25:07.103
Ruth came to see me last night.

25:11.123 --> 25:14.170
It was midnight. She'd been running.

25:14.171 --> 25:21.078
She had a red mark across her face,
like someone had hit her hard.

25:21.079 --> 25:23.101
I said I'd take her home,
but she got scared,

25:23.102 --> 25:25.137
insisted she needed to stay with me.

25:25.138 --> 25:27.163
I told her that wasn't possible.

25:27.164 --> 25:30.130
Then I...

25:30.131 --> 25:32.110
gave her that letter back.

25:32.111 --> 25:34.131
She'd delivered it
earlier in the day.

25:35.151 --> 25:38.163
She started pleading with me.
But I told her to go.

25:38.164 --> 25:41.150
You sent her packing?
Yes. A vulnerable,

25:41.151 --> 25:45.123
terrified, attractive girl.
Into the woods, at night, alone.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.130
Yes.

25:47.131 --> 25:50.159
Just now you didn't know this girl
had feelings for you. I lied.

25:52.079 --> 25:54.102
It's why I left the Bennetts.

25:54.103 --> 25:56.094
She tried to kiss me.

25:56.095 --> 25:58.097
But I have never laid
a finger on her.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.145
Not without good medical reason.

25:59.146 --> 26:02.149
According to this, you've laid
slightly more... It's fiction!

26:02.150 --> 26:05.089
All right.
Well, let's stick to facts, then.

26:05.090 --> 26:07.089
Ruth Bennett came to you
last night and said

26:07.090 --> 26:10.073
she'd expose your relationship
unless you eloped. In that moment,

26:10.074 --> 26:12.077
you knew you had to shut her up.
That's not true.

26:12.078 --> 26:16.143
Maybe you had your way with her one
last time. Maybe she died happy.
Shut up! Where is she?

26:17.171 --> 26:22.130
This diary...
you saw it first, yesterday?

26:22.131 --> 26:28.102
Alice knew of it, said nothing.
Never even looked inside.

26:28.103 --> 26:31.079
If only she'd not been
so discrete...

26:37.087 --> 26:39.090
Mrs. Bennett. Well?

26:39.091 --> 26:41.146
Still sticking to his story.

26:41.147 --> 26:44.107
That man is evil!

26:46.079 --> 26:48.167
Do you want to come
and wait in my office? Thank you.

26:51.091 --> 26:53.161
Inspector, about the diary...

26:53.162 --> 26:55.155
I told you last night to run along.

26:55.156 --> 27:00.074
In my experience, a 14-year-old girl
can be a very unreliable narrator.

27:00.075 --> 27:02.133
If I may, I would like to speak
to Dr Evans.

27:02.134 --> 27:06.081
Ruth Bennett is lying in some hole,
some ditch, somewhere in Kembleford!

27:06.082 --> 27:08.161
She's probably dead,
but she might just be alive!

27:08.162 --> 27:11.119
I'm going to break Evans.
But every minute counts,

27:11.120 --> 27:14.079
including the one
I'm wasting on you!

27:22.115 --> 27:26.098
Alice, you look like you
could do with a hand.

27:26.099 --> 27:27.167
Thank you, Father.

27:27.168 --> 27:31.102
You're an observant woman.
Ruth's diary...

27:31.103 --> 27:34.105
I happened to see the young lady
hide it a few months back.

27:34.106 --> 27:38.149
And you hadn't mentioned it
before today. You are admirable.

27:38.150 --> 27:41.167
It's lucky for the young lady
I'm not a gossip.

27:41.168 --> 27:44.127
If her father
had read that thing, well...

27:46.143 --> 27:48.097
I would have feared for her.

27:48.098 --> 27:50.135
Are you sure
he never saw it before today?

27:50.136 --> 27:53.087
Mrs Bennett assured me of it.

27:54.171 --> 27:57.125
That argument
the night Ruth disappeared...

27:57.126 --> 28:01.087
Did you hear what it was about?
As God is my witness, I did not.

28:01.088 --> 28:05.094
What I saw and heard troubled me,
I confess.

28:05.095 --> 28:08.103
As did their delay in reporting
her disappearance.

28:09.131 --> 28:12.094
Say they had found it,

28:12.095 --> 28:13.145
her father confronted her,

28:13.146 --> 28:16.089
she ran away to Evans to
escape her punishment.

28:16.090 --> 28:18.115
And Evans sent her back home...

28:20.103 --> 28:22.091
What are you suggesting, Father?

28:23.139 --> 28:26.167
That anger can take us
to countries we never knew existed.

28:29.135 --> 28:31.138
Where is Mr Bennett?

28:31.139 --> 28:34.117
Out looking for his daughter.
Worried sick.

28:34.118 --> 28:37.135
Thank you, Father, I can manage.
Good day, Alice.

28:39.163 --> 28:40.167
Father...

28:42.107 --> 28:43.139
There's something...

28:47.095 --> 28:49.095
Before Inspector Valentine arrived,

28:49.096 --> 28:52.095
Mr and Mrs Bennett
tidied up Ruth's room.

28:54.155 --> 28:55.159
Thank you.

29:19.087 --> 29:22.155
That was what she was wearing
when I last saw her. Sure?

29:24.095 --> 29:26.127
Evans could have planted this.

29:40.147 --> 29:42.091
Father?

29:44.079 --> 29:47.117
Susie said you'd be here.
Done what you asked.

29:47.118 --> 29:50.163
And? You're definitely going
to want to hear this.

30:01.155 --> 30:03.106
Mrs Bennett...

30:03.107 --> 30:07.159
the night Ruth disappeared,
did your husband strike her at all?

30:07.160 --> 30:09.115
No.

30:11.075 --> 30:12.119
I did.

30:14.155 --> 30:16.143
Was this a frequent occurrence?

30:18.079 --> 30:19.171
It was the first time.

30:19.172 --> 30:21.143
What happened?

30:24.131 --> 30:25.135
Mrs Bennett?

30:30.127 --> 30:33.159
She was being disrespectful.
What about?

30:35.103 --> 30:37.166
A very private matter.

30:37.167 --> 30:41.122
You may want to tell me
what that private matter is.

30:41.123 --> 30:44.110
I can't. Mrs. Bennett,
did you find out

30:44.111 --> 30:48.106
about your daughter's relationship
with Dr Evans? No.

30:48.107 --> 30:51.139
Did you harm her in any other way
that night? No!

30:51.140 --> 30:55.151
You do understand why I'm asking?
I am her mother.

31:02.167 --> 31:05.137
I wonder if the reason you didn't
call us straight away is

31:05.138 --> 31:08.081
because you wanted to
get your story straight?

31:08.082 --> 31:10.161
What story?
In your account of the evening,

31:10.162 --> 31:14.155
you left out the bit about your wife
striking your daughter.

31:14.156 --> 31:18.126
What does it matter?
Ruth was upset and ran away.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.171
Your daughter's bloodstained clothes
have been found

31:20.172 --> 31:22.163
in your dustbin, Mr Bennett.

31:26.123 --> 31:28.117
Can you vouch
for your wife's movements

31:28.118 --> 31:30.155
the night Ruth disappeared? No.

31:32.083 --> 31:33.087
And why is that?

31:34.151 --> 31:37.091
We have separate
sleeping arrangements.

31:41.083 --> 31:43.110
You're a gifted photographer.

31:43.111 --> 31:44.158
Thank you.

31:44.159 --> 31:49.102
And, I hear,
a very talented plumber.

31:49.103 --> 31:51.139
I should be searching for Ruth.

31:51.140 --> 31:54.078
I promise I won't keep you long.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.163
A friend of mine has been speaking

31:55.164 --> 31:58.142
to some families
you've done work for.

31:58.143 --> 32:00.171
All of them
outside Kembleford, actually.

32:00.172 --> 32:04.142
And they describe you as
"conscientious" and "reliable"

32:04.143 --> 32:06.139
and your work is "excellent".

32:08.123 --> 32:12.167
And yet your work for the Bennetts,
your best friends in England,

32:12.168 --> 32:16.098
apparently comes from the "cowboy"
end of the spectrum.

32:16.099 --> 32:17.146
Who says?

32:17.147 --> 32:18.151
The Bennetts.

32:22.075 --> 32:25.091
I may have been a little... greedy.

32:26.171 --> 32:30.135
Why, because they're rich?
And they'd always give you work?

32:32.099 --> 32:36.106
Ah, that's why they suddenly
turned against you?

32:36.107 --> 32:40.167
Because they finally realised
you'd been swindling them?

32:45.119 --> 32:46.143
Bit warm for gloves.

32:48.083 --> 32:51.118
I have to keep them on.

32:51.119 --> 32:53.146
It's an old work injury.

32:53.147 --> 32:56.078
Mmm. May I see it?

32:56.079 --> 32:58.106
I don't show anyone.

32:58.107 --> 32:59.159
Even the Bennetts?

32:59.160 --> 33:01.102
No.

33:01.103 --> 33:06.162
Because the friend of mine
also said that, outside Kembleford,

33:06.163 --> 33:10.135
you have been known to remove your
gloves every now and again.

33:12.143 --> 33:15.146
This is no time
for secrets, Douglas.

33:15.147 --> 33:18.103
Not while there's a chance
she's alive.

33:30.119 --> 33:32.083
Do you know how you got these?

33:34.151 --> 33:36.171
How did Ruth get hers?

33:42.163 --> 33:45.139
You weren't after
the Bennett's money, were you?

33:45.140 --> 33:48.091
That's not you at all.

33:49.147 --> 33:52.139
It's time you were greedy for
in that house. No.

33:52.140 --> 33:55.123
This is about your hands, isn't it?

33:57.115 --> 34:01.171
This is about you and Ruth.
Get out!

34:08.163 --> 34:10.114
It's impossible!

34:10.114 --> 34:12.126
We owe only three minutes.

34:12.127 --> 34:16.107
And I forgave PC Crawford
an egregious infidelity to get that.

34:16.108 --> 34:19.110
The warts aren't infectious.

34:19.110 --> 34:22.074
Douglas Taylor's condition
can't be connected to Ruth.

34:22.076 --> 34:26.078
Well, might they be transferred
in another way? Such as?

34:26.079 --> 34:27.147
I did have one thought.

34:27.148 --> 34:30.166
The formation of the warts
on Ruth's body.

34:30.167 --> 34:34.074
I realised what they reminded me of.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.079
Fingerprints.

34:37.139 --> 34:42.170
Modest research has revealed
a list of hazardous substances

34:42.170 --> 34:46.074
as used by ship builders,
railway locomotive engineers

34:46.074 --> 34:48.091
and, as it happens, plumbers.

34:50.107 --> 34:53.159
Might not one of these
toxic substances have been

34:53.159 --> 34:57.150
transferred onto Ruth's skin
by his hands?

34:57.150 --> 35:02.107
How? In some illicit physical act?

35:06.131 --> 35:07.135
Possibly.

35:08.159 --> 35:14.118
♪ There may be trouble ahead

35:14.119 --> 35:18.162
♪ But while there's moonlight
and music

35:18.163 --> 35:20.114
♪ And love and romance... ♪

35:20.115 --> 35:22.163
Even I wouldn't steal
the same thing twice.

35:22.164 --> 35:24.142
Still no sign, then?

35:24.143 --> 35:28.091
No. I do not understand.

36:06.131 --> 36:10.127
Another false alarm, no doubt.
Out of the way!

36:12.151 --> 36:15.127
Silly, silly girl!

36:17.155 --> 36:22.139
Right, evacuate the area.

37:10.115 --> 37:11.127
Thank you.

37:27.123 --> 37:28.155
What in Heaven's name?

37:30.103 --> 37:31.165
Have you gone mad?

37:31.166 --> 37:35.167
You must have taken a great many
pictures of her over the years.

37:37.159 --> 37:41.119
Where is she, Douglas? Where have
you hidden your little angel?

38:04.091 --> 38:06.083
She's your little girl.

38:08.171 --> 38:10.123
How did it happen?

38:13.111 --> 38:14.155
Emily was still a virgin.

38:17.135 --> 38:20.131
She had doubts
about marrying Geoffrey.

38:23.075 --> 38:24.079
I was weak.

38:26.139 --> 38:29.135
She told Geoffrey
the father died in the war.

38:29.136 --> 38:31.075
He forgave her.

38:33.075 --> 38:34.139
He's a good man. Mm.

38:37.099 --> 38:38.155
When she was born white...

38:40.163 --> 38:41.167
It was a miracle.

38:44.107 --> 38:47.111
Emily said I could see
her as long as I kept the secret.

38:49.107 --> 38:52.111
But I couldn't die without
hearing her call me "Dad".

38:54.103 --> 38:55.107
So you told her?

38:56.147 --> 38:58.151
The night she disappeared?

39:00.171 --> 39:02.122
Yes.

39:02.123 --> 39:04.119
Where is she, Douglas?

39:12.131 --> 39:15.171
Well, how was I supposed to know
they were bleeding radioactive?

39:15.172 --> 39:17.159
There you go, darlin'!

39:29.075 --> 39:31.098
There you are, Father!

39:31.099 --> 39:35.078
I heard the siren.
A false alarm. Thank God.

39:35.079 --> 39:37.139
But, Father,
Emily Bennett has been arrested.

39:37.140 --> 39:41.122
The Inspector thinks
she murdered her own daughter.

39:41.123 --> 39:43.078
Go and tell that policeman

39:43.079 --> 39:47.074
the very interesting
story about your mother's cat.

39:47.075 --> 39:51.111
The one who could open the door?
Yes. Certainly, Father.

40:25.087 --> 40:26.131
Thank you, Sid.

40:30.119 --> 40:31.123
Ruth?

40:33.111 --> 40:35.151
It's Father Brown.
No-one knows I'm here.

40:39.107 --> 40:42.083
Michael's not coming back.

40:47.087 --> 40:48.091
How do you know?

40:50.131 --> 40:52.083
He's in a police cell.

40:54.127 --> 40:57.073
But they found my clothes.
I heard them talking outside.

40:57.074 --> 40:58.161
Yes. That was clever of you.

40:58.162 --> 41:02.099
So why isn't he coming home?
Because they found your diary.

41:03.159 --> 41:08.074
And they won't release him
until you admit you made it up.

41:08.075 --> 41:11.111
Did you really think after all this,
that you could run away

41:11.112 --> 41:13.091
and live happily ever after?

41:14.123 --> 41:15.127
Yes.

41:18.119 --> 41:21.139
You and Michael
will never be together.

41:23.075 --> 41:25.167
You don't know that. Michael told me.

41:27.107 --> 41:29.171
I'm sorry, Ruth.

41:33.095 --> 41:37.101
I understand you got scared
when you found out about Douglas.

41:37.102 --> 41:40.075
I understand why you
turned on your parents.

41:41.099 --> 41:45.162
But now... it's time to go home.

41:45.163 --> 41:47.123
I'm never going home.

41:50.083 --> 41:52.107
You hid in the woods, am I right?

41:53.155 --> 41:57.110
All night,
whilst they searched this place.

41:57.111 --> 42:00.130
That must have been very
frightening.

42:00.131 --> 42:03.143
I think you're brave enough
to go home, Ruth.

42:09.115 --> 42:13.091
Where are you going to go?
London. How will you survive?

42:16.083 --> 42:18.159
They think your mum killed you.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.107
Good. What about Douglas?

42:22.127 --> 42:25.082
I believe he loves you very much.

42:25.083 --> 42:27.095
And has done all your life.

42:28.123 --> 42:31.074
But he won't be around
for much longer.

42:31.075 --> 42:34.082
What do you mean?

42:34.083 --> 42:36.110
He's dying.

42:36.111 --> 42:38.102
No, he's not.

42:38.103 --> 42:42.127
Your parents have been
protecting you. He's got cancer.

42:45.075 --> 42:49.095
Spend time with your real dad.
While you still can.

43:29.115 --> 43:32.083
I never once betrayed
our marriage, Geoffrey.

44:12.143 --> 44:13.147
Hello, Dad.

44:37.139 --> 44:40.090
What is that child doing now?

44:40.091 --> 44:44.087
Well, I expect she's doing exactly
what Mr Bennett told her to.

44:45.139 --> 44:47.126
Three months, you say?

44:47.127 --> 44:51.130
At most.
The lung cancer is very advanced.

44:51.131 --> 44:54.161
The cause is unknown,
as with most of these cases.

44:54.162 --> 44:57.109
But whatever material Douglas
carried on his hands,

44:57.110 --> 44:59.131
I suspect Ruth's lungs
won't have been exposed

44:59.132 --> 45:01.094
in the same way his have.

45:01.095 --> 45:04.107
God willing, she may yet
be all right.

45:06.111 --> 45:08.090
What next for you?

45:08.091 --> 45:12.078
I'm going back to the lab.
To study the lung cancers?

45:12.079 --> 45:16.103
Focussing on three materials,
all from your list, actually -

45:16.104 --> 45:18.155
lead, tin and asbestos.

45:22.119 --> 45:25.131
I'll wait here,
if you want to get your counter.

45:25.132 --> 45:30.130
I never believed it myself.
Other people gossiping...

45:30.131 --> 45:33.102
Father Brown will back me up.
Father?

45:33.103 --> 45:37.079
"The leper must be cast out
of the camp", Mrs McCarthy!
