00:00.433 --> 00:05.471
Adult adam: <i> Growing up,</i>
<i> my brother fancied himself</i>
<i> quite the ladies' man.</i>

00:05.473 --> 00:08.707
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> the only lady</i>
<i> who was into him</i>

00:08.709 --> 00:09.308
<i> Was this lady.</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:12.945
I know I'm your mother,
but I think I can say this
without bias.

00:12.947 --> 00:15.647
Uh, you are an adonis
cut from marble

00:15.649 --> 00:18.017
Sent from heaven
to be scrumptious.

00:18.019 --> 00:20.719
(chuckles) oh,
you got some schmutz.

00:20.721 --> 00:21.553
Adult adam: <i> Truth is,</i>

00:21.555 --> 00:25.657
<i> Barry had absolutely no game</i>
<i> in the woman department.</i>

00:25.659 --> 00:26.191
(tires screech)

00:26.193 --> 00:28.861
Guess who's gonna be
a professional bmx biker.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.429
Guess who doesn't care.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.363
Okay, then.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.198
Adult adam:
<i> Yep. No game whatsoever.</i>

00:33.200 --> 00:36.535
(rapping)
<i> ¶ big tasty wants to</i>
<i> take you on a boat ride</i>

00:36.537 --> 00:39.405
<i> ¶ I know it's not good timing</i>
<i> 'cause your cat died ¶</i>

00:39.407 --> 00:42.474
Adult adam:
<i> Especially when it came to</i>
<i> erica's best friend, lainey.</i>

00:42.476 --> 00:46.111
<i> She was the girl</i>
<i> he pined after</i>
<i> since first grade.</i>

00:46.113 --> 00:49.081
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> it wasn't reciprocated.</i>

00:49.083 --> 00:51.550
<i> Yep, my brother</i>
<i> was a lost cause...</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:52.785
<i> Or so we thought.</i>

00:52.787 --> 00:55.220
"general hospital's" on.
Get out.

00:55.222 --> 00:55.754
Can't. I'm busy.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.891
Doing what?
Sitting down here alone,
like a weirdo?

00:58.893 --> 01:00.659
Sometimes I just like
to light a candle

01:00.661 --> 01:03.328
And sit
with my thoughts.
(clank)

01:04.230 --> 01:06.999
Erica, wait!
Lainey?

01:07.001 --> 01:08.500
Hey.
(laughs nervously)

01:08.502 --> 01:11.870
Just looking for my scrunchie.
Guess it's not down there.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.105
It's in your hair.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.274
Oh! So it is.
(laughs)

01:15.276 --> 01:17.976
It's always
the last place you look.
Okay, bye-bye now.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.912
No, come back!

01:20.046 --> 01:21.613
Hold it right there!

01:21.615 --> 01:24.483
Are you and barry,
together?

01:24.485 --> 01:26.251
No. Not really.
I mean, kinda.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.220
He repulses me,
but I'm still drawn to him.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.321
Ew!
I know!

01:29.323 --> 01:31.090
He's clumsy and annoying
and has those big,

01:31.092 --> 01:33.692
Brown eyes and cute dimples
when he smiles.

01:33.694 --> 01:34.293
Ew!
I know!

01:34.295 --> 01:37.763
Lainey, we're talking
about my brother.
This has to stop!

01:37.765 --> 01:38.630
I know!
Ew!

01:38.632 --> 01:40.833
I've tried, but I keep
getting pulled back in.

01:40.835 --> 01:42.101
It's like
he annoys me so much,

01:42.103 --> 01:44.203
I just want
to kiss his stupid face.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.737
Ew!
I know!

01:45.739 --> 01:46.138
Ladies.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.108
Can I interest either of you
in an orange crush on ice?

01:49.110 --> 01:50.209
Both: Ew! You!
Me.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.911
Gotta go.
You cannot date
my best friend.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.780
It's an unholy union!
I forbid it!
(door closing)

01:54.782 --> 01:58.050
Please do.
Forbidden love
is the best kind of love.

01:58.052 --> 02:00.853
Right after tender
and jungle.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.087
(laughing) oh!

02:02.089 --> 02:02.888
You're delusional.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.656
Your relationship's
not even real.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.225
Why do you think
she's keeping it a secret?

02:06.227 --> 02:07.726
Oh, we'll see
how much of a secret it is

02:07.728 --> 02:12.097
After lainey asks me
to the darryl dawkins
dance this Friday.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.232
Darryl dawkins?

02:13.234 --> 02:13.999
Do you mean sadie hawkins?

02:14.001 --> 02:18.237
No! I'm talking about
the dance when the girls
ask the guys.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.140
It's named
after the basketball
player darryl dawkins.

02:21.142 --> 02:21.807
Who?

02:21.809 --> 02:25.310
Dr. Dunkenstein,
the rim wrecker,

02:25.312 --> 02:26.211
Chocolate thunder,

02:26.213 --> 02:28.013
Don't fake the funk
on a nasty dunk.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.349
Why would a dance
where the girls ask the guys

02:30.351 --> 02:31.450
Be named after
a basketball player?

02:31.452 --> 02:34.019
'cause it's like
the ball's in your court,
girl.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.088
That actually makes
a tiny bit of sense.

02:36.090 --> 02:38.023
But lainey's
not asking you.

02:38.025 --> 02:38.824
Oh, she will.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.260
And we'll dance,
and we'll drink punch,

02:41.262 --> 02:44.129
And we'll fall in love,
and we'll get married.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.230
Stop talking.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.832
Keep talking.
Who's getting married?

02:46.834 --> 02:48.767
I heard "married,"
and I came running.

02:48.769 --> 02:49.735
Both: No one.

02:49.737 --> 02:50.536
Well, just so you know,

02:50.538 --> 02:54.072
I've picked out the
perfect person for each
of my children,

02:54.074 --> 02:55.407
So whenever you're ready,

02:55.409 --> 02:57.776
I can introduce you
to your soul mate.

02:57.778 --> 02:58.443
Pass!
Pass.

02:58.445 --> 03:01.580
Come on. Don't you want
what your father and I have?

03:01.582 --> 03:03.382
Murray: Bevy!

03:03.384 --> 03:05.984
I dropped your toothbrush
in the toilet again.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.686
Did you do the right thing
and toss it,

03:07.688 --> 03:09.655
Or did you put it
back in the holder?

03:09.657 --> 03:11.924
The right thing.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.529
Soul mates.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.331
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

03:19.333 --> 03:24.937
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

03:25.572 --> 03:26.672
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

03:26.674 --> 03:30.909
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:30.911 --> 03:32.678
Adult adam:
<i> It was Saturday morning,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

03:32.680 --> 03:35.681
<i> And that meant one thing...</i>
<i> Cartoons.</i>
(grunts)

03:35.683 --> 03:39.051
<i> Children across america</i>
<i> would park themselves</i>
<i> on the couch</i>

03:39.053 --> 03:42.588
<i> And be sucked into endless</i>
<i> hours of their favorite shows.</i>

03:42.590 --> 03:45.390
<i> There was</i> g.I. Joe,
dinosaucers.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.091
The real ghostbusters,

03:46.093 --> 03:49.795
<i> And the greatest one of all,</i>
transformers.

03:49.797 --> 03:53.498
So, they're robots...
But they're also cars?

03:53.500 --> 03:56.535
And trucks and planes
and sometimes dinosaurs.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.503
Why would you ruin
a perfectly good fiero

03:58.505 --> 04:01.039
By turning it into
some dumb robot?

04:01.041 --> 04:03.175
Dumb? It's the world's
greatest cartoon.

04:03.177 --> 04:04.710
They just came out
with an animated movie.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.045
They took this
and made it longer?
I don't get it.

04:07.047 --> 04:11.149
Oh, but a grown man
hitting a ball
with a stick...

04:11.151 --> 04:12.150
That makes sense?

04:12.152 --> 04:14.119
Don't you
come after baseball.

04:14.121 --> 04:14.953
It's america's pastime.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.990
And robots
are america's future!
Deal with it!

04:17.992 --> 04:19.825
Deal with what?
Robots aren't even real.

04:19.827 --> 04:23.895
Oh, you'll see
how real they are when
cyborgs take over

04:23.897 --> 04:25.564
And outlaw
your precious baseball.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.466
Never.
And you know why?

04:27.468 --> 04:29.434
Because we will rise up
with our bats

04:29.436 --> 04:31.637
And destroy
those metal bastards.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.939
A bat
against a plasma cannon?

04:33.941 --> 04:36.608
Good luck mining steel
for your robot overlords.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.111
Okay, this has gotten
away from us.

04:39.113 --> 04:42.080
I'll take him
to the talking-car movie.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.582
You do what you do.

04:43.584 --> 04:44.049
(groans)

04:44.051 --> 04:45.517
Adult adam:
<i> Pops could care less</i>
<i> about my silly cartoon,</i>

04:45.519 --> 04:49.855
<i> But my best friend</i>
<i> would pretend to love</i>
<i> anything for me.</i>

04:49.857 --> 04:52.691
This is amazing.

04:53.693 --> 04:54.960
What's happening?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.295
Adam: That's the autobots.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.797
Those robots
are the good guys.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.667
Oh! Watch this. They're about
to kick decepticon butt.

05:01.669 --> 05:06.038
Adult adam: <i> But they didn't.</i>
<i> Instead, they did this...</i>

05:06.040 --> 05:08.774
<i> They killed</i>
<i> one of the good guys.</i>

05:08.776 --> 05:10.208
No.

05:10.677 --> 05:13.979
<i> Actually, they killed</i>
<i> all the good guys.</i>

05:13.981 --> 05:14.579
No!

05:14.581 --> 05:18.850
<i> Even optimus prime</i>
<i> was killed in cold blood.</i>

05:18.852 --> 05:21.787
<i> And along with it,</i>
<i> my innocence.</i>

05:21.789 --> 05:24.956
Do the good guys
always die like this?

05:24.958 --> 05:26.258
They're not dead.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.026
It's probably
a plot twist.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.762
They'll come back
and save the day.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.432
Adult adam:
<i> But they didn't.</i>

05:33.633 --> 05:35.834
You ready to go?
No.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.969
Optimus will be back.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.839
I don't think
he's coming back.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.108
Oh, he's coming back...

05:43.110 --> 05:47.112
Bigger and better
and not dead.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.146
He's dead, dude.

05:48.148 --> 05:52.784
Adult adam:
<i> While I was feeling down,</i>
<i> barry was trying to get down.</i>

05:52.786 --> 05:53.885
'sup, hot lips?

05:53.887 --> 05:54.920
You know the rules.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.622
We only talk
through the locker.

05:57.924 --> 05:58.557
'sup, hot lips?

05:58.559 --> 06:00.058
What do you want?
People are looking.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.560
I was wondering
when exactly

06:01.562 --> 06:02.494
You were gonna ask me
to the dance.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.796
Yeah, never.
'cause then people
would see us together.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.064
You know,
it kind of sounds like

06:06.066 --> 06:07.132
You don't want to be
seen with me in public.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.601
It sounds like that
'cause that's exactly
what I'm saying.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.969
(sighs)
aw, come on.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.605
Don't give me those puppy-dog
eyes through the locker.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.508
You know I can't say no
to those baby browns.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.542
Okay, fine!

06:17.544 --> 06:19.077
Just go stag,
and I'll dance
adjacent to you

06:19.079 --> 06:21.680
Without acknowledging
your presence.

06:21.682 --> 06:22.647
But, I was gonna bring
my cardboard

06:22.649 --> 06:24.850
So I can break-dance
for you, baby.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.284
I'm sorry.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.420
Lainey: Now go away.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.057
Adult adam: <i> Erica saw</i>
<i> that longing look</i>
<i> in lainey's eye</i>

06:32.059 --> 06:35.160
<i> And knew there was</i>
<i> only one thing to do.</i>
<i> Stop it.</i>

06:35.162 --> 06:38.096
Mom, I need you to get
heavily involved
with your son

06:38.098 --> 06:38.964
In an inappropriate way.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.665
I'm in.
You name it, I'll do it.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.666
It's barry.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.501
He's in a serious funk

06:42.503 --> 06:44.603
Because nobody's asked him
to the sadie hawkins dance.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.571
Well,
when you're that delicious,

06:46.573 --> 06:47.939
It can be intimidating.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.307
That's a theory.

06:49.309 --> 06:50.575
Anyway,
I think that he's ready

06:50.577 --> 06:52.778
To meet that soul mate
you had picked out for him.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.813
Oh, my god!
It's finally happening!

06:54.815 --> 06:59.084
My children are coming to me
to help them find love!

06:59.086 --> 06:59.785
(laughs)

06:59.787 --> 07:01.520
I have literally
found him

07:01.522 --> 07:04.322
The most perfect,
beautiful girl in the world.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.891
Great.
Now, when you're looking...

07:05.893 --> 07:07.526
No, let's just do this
already.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.493
Are you sure about this?

07:08.495 --> 07:10.729
I mean,
barry did specifically say

07:10.731 --> 07:12.464
He didn't want me
to set him up.

07:12.466 --> 07:12.998
You have to.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.001
This is not me being selfish
or having my own agenda.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.436
It's coming
from a place of love,

07:17.438 --> 07:20.138
Because I just
want barry to be happy.

07:21.007 --> 07:21.673
(bleep) me sideways.

07:21.675 --> 07:25.644
I have raised
some thoughtful children.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.112
Come here.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.249
Stand up straight.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.117
There it is.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.019
I mean, who murders
optimus prime?

07:34.021 --> 07:37.355
That's like killing superman
or knight rider or lassie.

07:37.357 --> 07:40.559
You've been ranting about
this for two days, kiddo.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.161
Come on.
He's just a cartoon robot.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.130
To you.
To me, he's a hero.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.999
If I made that movie,
optimus would live forever,

07:48.001 --> 07:50.469
And he would bring peace
to cybertron!

07:50.471 --> 07:52.137
I don't know
what you're talking about,

07:52.139 --> 07:54.039
But sure...
Let's make that movie.

07:54.041 --> 07:57.275
We'll right the wrongs
of those hollywood bastards.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.845
Well, if we do this,
we do it right.

07:59.847 --> 08:03.114
I'm talking top-of-the-line
costumes, set design,

08:03.116 --> 08:05.150
Romance,
big-budget stunt work.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.419
I got $75 in my wallet.

08:07.421 --> 08:09.054
Done.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.660
What the hell are you doing?
That's my chair!

08:15.662 --> 08:18.129
Now it's optimus prime's
command center.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.064
I'm making
an awesome movie.

08:19.066 --> 08:22.067
For how long?
We're thinking
five, six months.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.202
What?
I know.
It's gonna be tough

08:24.204 --> 08:25.403
With the
late-night shooting,

08:25.405 --> 08:26.738
The crew taking
over the house,

08:26.740 --> 08:29.274
And the huge water bill.
I got to flood
the basement.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.110
Oh, yeah? Well,
use somebody else's chair.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.144
Stop!

08:33.146 --> 08:34.379
You don't understand.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.248
Optimus was murdered
in cold blood.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.384
The greek exchange student
staying with the applebaum's?

08:39.386 --> 08:41.253
No.
That kid's name is niko.

08:41.255 --> 08:44.489
I'm talking about the robot
I like from the cartoon.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.624
So?

08:45.626 --> 08:46.191
So he's gone,

08:46.193 --> 08:49.027
And if it can happen to him,
it can happen to anyone.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.096
Oh.
I see what's happening.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.664
We need to have
the death talk.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.032
Eh, I'm fine.
We don't need to talk.

08:54.034 --> 08:58.069
I just think death sucks
and it shouldn't happen,
and I'm gonna undo it.

08:58.071 --> 09:01.907
Yeah, I know it's scary,
but we all got to go sometime.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.475
You got
nothing to worry about.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.410
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.178
Really?
Yeah.

09:07.180 --> 09:11.316
Now, if you were an old man,
different story.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.151
All right. Good talk.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.319
Adult adam:
<i> But it wasn't a good talk.</i>

09:14.321 --> 09:17.422
<i> Now I was worrying</i>
<i> about my other hero, pops.</i>

09:17.424 --> 09:21.059
Okay, time for my
big battle scene.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.930
Optimo gets run over
and lives.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.999
And hit me with the car.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.534
About that,
there were some rewrites.

09:29.536 --> 09:34.105
In the new scene,
optimus prime eats
a fiber-rich breakfast

09:34.107 --> 09:36.041
And goes for
a heart-smart walk.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.677
Okay, I'm not understanding
my character here.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.478
You told me
I was a badass.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.013
You are.
And after this scene,

09:42.015 --> 09:45.951
You're gonna rest up with
some hot tea under an afghan,

09:45.953 --> 09:46.451
Like a badass.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.887
Feels like you're taking
the teeth out of this thing.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.122
Well, I'm the director,
and this is my vision.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.158
Now,
take a calcium supplement

09:53.160 --> 09:54.092
And stand on your mark
in the shade.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.329
Oh, stop.
Just tap me.
Tap me with the car.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.864
You're old. It would shatter
your whole body.

09:59.866 --> 10:00.966
I'll show you old.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.400
Hit me with the car.
No!

10:02.402 --> 10:06.404
You get in that car
and you run me
over right now.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.773
Forget it!
You're too difficult
to work with!

10:08.775 --> 10:09.407
You're fired!

10:09.409 --> 10:12.310
You can't fire me!
I'm the star!

10:12.312 --> 10:12.844
I fire you!

10:12.846 --> 10:15.146
You can't fire me!
I brought you
onto this project!

10:15.148 --> 10:18.984
Well,
I'm pulling the funding,
'cause I'm very upset...

10:18.986 --> 10:24.055
Even though
I'm not quite clear
what we're arguing about.

10:24.757 --> 10:28.259
And I'm walking like this
because of the costume,

10:28.261 --> 10:30.795
Not because I'm old.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.499
Adult adam:
<i> Barry still might</i>
<i> not have had a date</i>

10:34.501 --> 10:35.400
<i> For the darryl dawkins dance,</i>

10:35.402 --> 10:39.004
<i> But thanks to erica's scheme,</i>
<i> he was about to get one.</i>

10:39.006 --> 10:42.907
Love bug,
I just got off the phone.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.442
What's the best news
you could think of?

10:44.444 --> 10:46.578
I'm gonna be on
a <i> wheaties box</i>
with pete rose.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.647
Close.
I found a wonderful girl,

10:48.649 --> 10:51.282
And she wants to ask you
to the sadie hawkins dance.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.551
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.854
She means
"darryl dawkins."

10:55.856 --> 10:56.488
Oh!

10:56.490 --> 10:58.957
Yeah, forget it.
I hate that stupid dance.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.725
Barry,
you should listen to her.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.661
Mom's the best matchmaker
in town, okay?

11:02.663 --> 11:05.230
She set me up with
a ton of great people.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.565
Really? Who?
You know, like, uh...

11:07.567 --> 11:08.633
(muffled)
mondragor mcalister.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.336
Mondragor mcalister?
Who's that?

11:11.338 --> 11:14.406
Well, he's...
(mumbling)

11:14.408 --> 11:16.241
Stop talking
into your soda can!

11:16.243 --> 11:17.308
(mumbling)

11:17.310 --> 11:18.543
Barry, trust your mother.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.578
I found
the girl of your dreams.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.213
She's smart, she's pretty,

11:22.215 --> 11:24.449
And she's waiting
in the kitchen.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.350
What is she doing?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.952
I already met
the girl of my dreams,
lainey.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.220
She said she might
dance adjacent to me.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.122
Dude, if you knew
what "adjacent" meant,

11:31.124 --> 11:32.323
You would not be okay
with that.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.893
(singsong voice)
here she is.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.394
This is evelyn silver.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.330
I know her mother
from my scrapbooking circle.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.267
I scrapbook, too, but I'm
nothing compared to bevy.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.268
She's the one
who bought me

11:43.270 --> 11:45.370
My first pair
of scalloping scissors.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.305
Your mom
is my arts-and-crafts guru.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.973
I mean,
I would have never thought

11:48.975 --> 11:51.643
To cut my pictures
into fun shapes,

11:51.645 --> 11:53.178
Like hearts and stars.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.312
Squares are for squares.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.916
(laughs)
<i> even weirder than barry</i>
<i> dating erica's best friend</i>

11:57.918 --> 12:00.218
<i> Was barry dating our mother.</i>

12:00.220 --> 12:00.952
Wait, wait.
I know you.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.855
You're the girl at school
who always argues
with the teachers.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.024
Only when they're wrong.
Which is a lot.

12:06.026 --> 12:06.691
Oh!
(gasps)

12:06.693 --> 12:08.893
Oh, dear god.
I like your sweater.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.129
I find it oddly comforting.
Thank you.

12:11.131 --> 12:14.466
You got some schmutz
on the side of...

12:14.468 --> 12:15.834
This is so, so creepy.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.869
Listen,
your mom was thinking

12:17.871 --> 12:20.138
Maybe we could
go to the dance together.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.740
Oh,
I don't know what...

12:21.742 --> 12:23.742
So you already have
a date?

12:24.477 --> 12:25.543
Not really.

12:25.545 --> 12:26.111
Well, you do now.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.079
I'm wearing pink,
so keep that in mind

12:28.081 --> 12:29.547
When you're buying
my corsage.

12:29.549 --> 12:30.882
No carnations.
Don't cheap out.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.752
Bevy! Where are
my comfortable loafers?

12:33.754 --> 12:35.854
Did you check
by the front door?

12:35.856 --> 12:36.354
Who are you?

12:36.356 --> 12:38.823
I'm evy.
You just called for me.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.024
No, I said "bevy."

12:40.026 --> 12:41.693
They're by
the front door.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.628
Well. Sorry.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.463
And thank you.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.766
Is that your hubby?
Yeah.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.568
What a catch.
(laughs)

12:50.636 --> 12:52.670
Oh, dear god.

12:56.742 --> 12:57.475
What are you doing?

12:57.477 --> 12:59.744
Signing up
for skydiving lessons.

12:59.746 --> 13:02.347
I'll show him who's old.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.414
Okay.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.583
I just got into a fight
with adam.

13:05.585 --> 13:08.153
You just got into a fight
with adam? Over what?

13:08.155 --> 13:10.955
He wouldn't run me over
with the car!

13:11.624 --> 13:12.423
Okay.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.725
I mean, all of a sudden,

13:13.727 --> 13:17.061
He's treating me like
some fragile old fogey.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.430
This might partially be
my fault.

13:19.432 --> 13:23.635
I may have said something
along the lines of
"old people die,"

13:23.637 --> 13:26.104
And he may have
jumped to conclusions.

13:26.106 --> 13:26.971
What conclusions?

13:26.973 --> 13:30.275
You know, if you're
at the deli counter of life

13:30.277 --> 13:31.442
And you've got
your ticket,

13:31.444 --> 13:34.579
You're gonna get
your sandwich sooner
than other people will.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.415
What is this horrible deli?
I hate this deli.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.716
We all got to eat there
sometime.

13:38.718 --> 13:40.585
Well, I'm just gonna have
a pickle.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.820
Can't just have a pickle.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.488
I can, and I will.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.889
You can't
just have a pickle.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.325
I'm in better shape
than you.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.726
Check out these guns!

13:48.728 --> 13:50.094
Why are you yelling at me?

13:50.096 --> 13:51.029
'cause it's your fault!

13:51.031 --> 13:52.997
You're the old guy
wearing the costume

13:52.999 --> 13:54.999
Of the dead robot
he loves.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.001
You're right.
The poor kid.

13:57.003 --> 14:00.405
He's probably scared
of losing his two
greatest heroes.

14:00.407 --> 14:04.876
I'm sure there's
a couple of other heroes
on that list...

14:04.878 --> 14:07.312
Like me, for example.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.081
Okay.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.417
Evelyn silver?

14:12.551 --> 14:14.919
How could you go to the dance
with evelyn silver?

14:14.921 --> 14:16.321
'cause she asked me!

14:16.323 --> 14:17.589
Well,
she kind of told me.

14:17.591 --> 14:20.158
She's pushy in a way
that feels familiar
and safe.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.427
Well, now we're
never not going to
the dance together.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.529
But we never were
going to the dance together.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.600
But now we're really
never not going to the
dance together.

14:28.602 --> 14:29.934
Okay,
I am totally lost here.

14:29.936 --> 14:32.303
I used to not want
to be seen with you
in public,

14:32.305 --> 14:34.639
But now I don't want
to be seen with you
in private, either.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.040
But if we were in private,
how could anyone see us?

14:36.042 --> 14:38.977
They wouldn't not see us,
but now they'll never
not see us!

14:38.979 --> 14:41.079
I think my brain
is about to explode!

14:41.081 --> 14:44.582
See if you understand this.
I'm dumping you.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.218
We were together?

14:47.486 --> 14:49.187
We were together!

14:49.189 --> 14:51.422
Wait! Come back!

14:52.057 --> 14:54.392
We were together.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.265
Adult adam:
<i> Pops gave me some time</i>

15:00.267 --> 15:02.333
<i> To cool down</i>
<i> from our big blowup.</i>

15:02.335 --> 15:04.369
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> I was hotter than ever.</i>

15:04.371 --> 15:07.071
Hey, kiddo.
(knocks on door)

15:07.073 --> 15:08.039
Can we talk?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.307
Busy.
I'm making a new movie.

15:09.309 --> 15:13.878
Stop-motion animation.
You know what's good
about that?

15:14.480 --> 15:15.613
No actors.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.516
Well, you look like crap.
Have you slept?

15:18.518 --> 15:22.453
No, I haven't slept.
I'm making
a masterpiece here.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.622
Okay, look.

15:29.194 --> 15:33.898
I know your dad
talked to you about
the deli of life,

15:33.900 --> 15:35.266
But you need to know,

15:35.268 --> 15:37.902
I'm not eating a sandwich
just yet.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.438
Maybe it's because
I'm super-tired,

15:40.440 --> 15:41.673
But you're making
no sense.

15:41.675 --> 15:45.643
Look,
everyone has their time.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.745
But I'm here,
I'm awesome,

15:47.747 --> 15:52.283
And I'm not going anywhere
anytime soon, kiddo.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.786
Really?
Really.

15:55.521 --> 15:57.855
Want to know my secret?

15:57.857 --> 16:02.226
Hanging out
with my best friend
keeps me young.

16:03.729 --> 16:04.696
Now...

16:04.698 --> 16:09.367
What do you say you run
your grandpa over with a car?

16:09.835 --> 16:11.703
I'd love to.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.275
Hey. Aren't you supposed
to be getting ready
for the dance?

16:17.277 --> 16:18.643
What's the point?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.378
I found love,
and I lost it.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.113
Now I'm never gonna
talk through a locker

16:22.115 --> 16:24.115
With someone I really
care about again.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.917
Well,
evy seems creepily into you.

16:25.919 --> 16:29.520
But lainey was cool
and made me feel alive,

16:29.522 --> 16:33.558
And I pretty much had
a crush on her
for my entire life.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.295
But, like you said,
she doesn't like me.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.097
Look,
I know my best friend.

16:39.099 --> 16:42.433
Lainey likes you.
She just treats you
like an annoying,

16:42.435 --> 16:44.068
Twerpy loser
because you let her.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.971
Doesn't matter now.
I ruined everything.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.540
(sighs)
no, I did.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.943
Mom didn't just randomly
set you up on a date.

16:51.945 --> 16:53.745
I may have
put her up to it

16:53.747 --> 16:56.881
Because I didn't want you
frenching on my best friend.

16:56.883 --> 16:57.315
What?

16:57.317 --> 16:59.884
I know it was wrong,
but now...

16:59.886 --> 17:02.653
I can't believe
I'm saying this...

17:02.655 --> 17:05.790
You should be at the dance
with her.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.091
Ew.

17:08.560 --> 17:13.731
<i> ¶ heaven isn't too far away</i>

17:15.067 --> 17:19.570
<i> ¶ closer to it every day</i>

17:19.572 --> 17:20.805
Lainey.
We need to talk.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.274
Uh, I'm sorry.
I don't know you.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.575
Just hear me out!

17:24.577 --> 17:26.677
No! Leave me alone!

17:26.679 --> 17:28.212
Lainey!

17:28.347 --> 17:29.380
Lainey!

17:29.382 --> 17:30.882
<i> ¶ how I love the way you move</i>

17:30.884 --> 17:33.684
<i> ¶ and the sparkle</i>
<i> in your eyes</i>

17:33.686 --> 17:35.019
Lainey, wait!

17:35.021 --> 17:35.920
Wait! Wait.

17:35.922 --> 17:40.358
Okay, I know
I'm irritating
and I sweat a lot

17:40.360 --> 17:43.127
And my rap flow
is too ahead of its time,

17:43.129 --> 17:46.364
So I get why you don't want
to be seen with me.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.900
But I just need to know
one thing...

17:48.902 --> 17:51.536
Do you like me?

17:52.471 --> 17:53.771
I do.
Please don't tell anyone.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.706
I won't! But it's
come to my attention

17:55.708 --> 17:59.210
You only treat me this way
because I put up with it.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.112
But I'm here
to tell you...

18:01.114 --> 18:03.247
I want to put up with it.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.016
Let me stand
in the shadows.

18:05.018 --> 18:08.119
Let me only talk to you
through your locker vent.

18:08.121 --> 18:11.422
Let me be
your secret shame.

18:12.191 --> 18:13.791
God, you're annoying.

18:13.793 --> 18:14.592
I know.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.461
Come on. Let's dance.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.729
We can still hear the music
out here.

18:20.132 --> 18:21.165
No.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.233
Let's go inside.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.901
Then everyone will see us.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.670
That's the point, dummy.

18:29.308 --> 18:35.847
<i> ¶ heaven isn't too far away</i>

18:35.849 --> 18:40.852
<i> ¶ closer to it every day</i>

18:40.854 --> 18:41.486
<i> ¶ ah, ah</i>

18:41.488 --> 18:47.391
<i> ¶ no matter</i>
<i> what your friends might say</i>

18:47.393 --> 18:51.896
<i> ¶ we'll find our way</i>

18:51.898 --> 18:53.164
<i> ¶ yeah</i>

18:53.166 --> 18:55.133
(guitar solo)

18:55.135 --> 18:58.069
Adult adam:
<i> Yep, barry goldberg</i>
<i> was on top of the world,</i>

18:58.071 --> 18:59.770
<i> And no one could ruin that...</i>

18:59.772 --> 19:02.106
<i> Not even beverly goldberg.</i>

19:02.108 --> 19:03.274
What the hell
is this?

19:03.276 --> 19:04.609
I set barry up
with his soul mate,

19:04.611 --> 19:05.877
And he's not even
with her

19:05.879 --> 19:07.378
When I show up
completely unannounced?

19:07.380 --> 19:09.147
Yeah, about that.
Why are you here?

19:09.149 --> 19:11.015
I came to see
the lovebirds,

19:11.017 --> 19:13.284
But those are
the wrong lovebirds!

19:13.286 --> 19:14.986
Yeah, but maybe not.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.189
<i> ¶ now the lights</i>
<i> are going out</i>

19:18.624 --> 19:19.323
He does look happy.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.026
He really does.
Wait.
What happened to evy?

19:22.028 --> 19:22.927
Oh, I took care of that.

19:22.929 --> 19:26.697
Turns out matchmaking
runs in the family.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.200
Damn it.
This is my only good tie.

19:29.202 --> 19:29.967
Oh, honey, that's okay.

19:29.969 --> 19:33.838
Don't touch it.
Rub it out with club soda.
Be good as new.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.373
<i> ¶ I don't know what to do ¶</i>

19:35.375 --> 19:37.708
Adult adam:
<i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about growing up...</i>

19:37.710 --> 19:42.480
<i> There's those perfect moments</i>
<i> where life just surprises you.</i>

19:42.781 --> 19:46.450
<i> For barry,</i>
<i> that moment was now.</i>

19:47.986 --> 19:49.020
<i> And for me, I felt that moment</i>

19:49.022 --> 19:53.057
<i> Every time</i>
<i> I was with my grandfather.</i>
(tires screech)

19:55.060 --> 19:58.029
<i> That's the end of you,</i>
<i> optimus.</i>

20:00.098 --> 20:02.400
<i> I literally cannot die!</i>

20:02.402 --> 20:04.802
Adult adam:
<i> He was more than my hero.</i>

20:04.804 --> 20:06.003
<i> He was my best friend.</i>

20:06.005 --> 20:08.306
So, what'd you think,
kiddo?

20:08.807 --> 20:10.708
I love it.

20:18.317 --> 20:19.951
(bell dings)

20:21.553 --> 20:23.955
Adam: <i> Optimus! No!</i>

20:23.957 --> 20:24.455
(sobs)

20:24.457 --> 20:30.127
<i> We gather here today</i>
<i> to witness the burial</i>
<i> of optimus prime.</i>

20:30.129 --> 20:32.630
<i> Later that night...</i>

20:33.332 --> 20:36.367
<i> There's no optimus!</i>
<i> He's gone!</i>

20:39.404 --> 20:42.073
(dance music playing)

20:51.350 --> 20:53.918
Take the wave from me.
What? No.
I don't want the wave.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.687
Come on! Take it!
Stop it!
I don't want it!

20:56.689 --> 20:57.154
No wave.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.689
What the hell?
I've been waiting

20:58.691 --> 20:59.624
In the car 10 minutes.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.693
Just watching barry.
He's quite the dancer.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.995
Looks like a moron
to me.

21:03.997 --> 21:05.329
You can say that
again.

21:05.331 --> 21:06.397
Evy,
I'm gonna go sit

21:06.399 --> 21:08.599
In the comfortable chairs
over there.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.369
Sitting?
That sounds good.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.941
Okay, yeah, I see it now.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.511
(dance music playing)
