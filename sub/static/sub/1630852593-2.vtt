00:29.080 --> 00:30.040
-<i>Tony.</i>
<i>-Oh!</i>

00:30.120 --> 00:31.520
<i>-Oh.</i>

00:31.600 --> 00:32.440
<i>Fuck.</i>

00:33.800 --> 00:35.960
<i>My heart rate was already at fucking 140.</i>

00:36.040 --> 00:37.280
<i> Yeah, I could see.</i>

00:38.360 --> 00:39.360
<i>Brilliant.</i>

00:45.960 --> 00:46.800
Come on.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.200
There you go.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.840
-Cheers.
-All right?

01:36.920 --> 01:38.360
Yeah. Good. You?

01:38.440 --> 01:40.280
Yeah, good. How's the dog?

01:40.920 --> 01:41.760
How's the dog?

01:41.840 --> 01:44.720
Yeah, yeah. Chilling
on the couch, I'll bet.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.120
-Yeah, she's good.
-Yeah.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.560
Great. Great. Yeah.
Oh, ask me how my girlfriend is.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.360
-How's your girlfriend?
-Good. Good. Yeah.

01:55.440 --> 01:58.560
Being done from behind as we speak
by Andy Norris, the bookmaker.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.240
Right.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.120
See ya.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.760
It's nice out there again today, isn't it?

02:26.840 --> 02:29.480
Maybe get you outside for a wee walk.

02:31.640 --> 02:34.280
Sorry about last night.
Obviously nothing to do with you.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.840
I just-- I can't stand people interfering.

02:36.920 --> 02:37.760
Sure.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.760
It was all so forced and in public and--

02:41.280 --> 02:44.120
Do you fancy a drink tonight, then?
Just-- Just us?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.080
-No.
-Really?

02:46.160 --> 02:48.000
Joking. Of course I fancy a drink.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.200
Where do you wanna go?

02:49.280 --> 02:51.720
Nowhere. I drink on the couch.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.320
Okay. Maybe I can come
and sit on a couch nearby.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.640
Yep.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.320
-Got any gin?
-Got everything.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.320
-Tonic?
-I meant everything alcoholic.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.080
-I'll get some tonic.
-Yeah.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
-A lemon?
-No.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.600
I'll bring a lemon then.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.120
-You all right?
-Are you my son?

03:18.240 --> 03:20.480
It's like nothing's changed, innit?

03:20.560 --> 03:22.040
-What?
-Dad.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.400
-See ya later.
-Hmm.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.440
Still early. 9:15.

03:31.520 --> 03:32.840
Fancy a cup of tea?

03:33.720 --> 03:34.800
Yeah. Why not?

03:36.080 --> 03:37.000
No room for me?

03:37.760 --> 03:38.600
Oh.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.320
-We were just leaving.
-Oh.

03:41.000 --> 03:41.840
Okay.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.720
Off anywhere nice?

03:43.800 --> 03:46.080
-Just going for a cup of tea.
-Great.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.040
Okay.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.160
See ya later.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.520
-You okay?
-Definitely.

03:56.920 --> 03:57.800
Yeah.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.680
I'm not replacing Stan, by the way.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.080
-What do you mean?
-Anne and me.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.960
We still miss our other halves
with all our heart.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.080
Only now, we--

04:09.800 --> 04:11.040
we miss them together.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.960
You wanted two lonely people
to be happy, right?

04:14.040 --> 04:14.880
Yeah.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.640
And, uh, I don't think that, at any point,
you ever asked yourself,

04:18.720 --> 04:21.800
"I hope their late partners don't mind."

04:22.480 --> 04:23.480
No, of course not.

04:23.560 --> 04:27.280
So why do you impose
such a restriction on yourself?

04:43.560 --> 04:44.440
Alone again.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.200
That's fine.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.520
You know me. I'm not one to complain.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.520
Oh, I still miss you so much.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.320
I don't think I'll ever get over it.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.160
I'm not strong enough.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.160
Not without you.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.920
I'm still going through
the stages of grief.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.200
Denial's the tricky one.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.040
I was never in denial that you were gone.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.320
I was in denial that

05:14.760 --> 05:17.440
I was suffering from mental illness.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.560
Even when I was suicidal, I never thought
there was anything wrong with me.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.120
I thought that was
the sensible thing to do,

05:24.200 --> 05:28.000
and it annoyed me that other people
thought I wasn't thinking straight.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.960
It was only recently I realized I was ill.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.880
I guess that was
the glimmer of hope to getting better.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.440
It feels good.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.600
Talking to you.

06:02.440 --> 06:05.120
Sorry, how it ended last night,

06:05.200 --> 06:06.920
but I wasn't in the mood,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.400
and I didn't know
why you were criticizing Lisa.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.520
No one was criticizing Lisa.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.160
We just didn't want Emma
to feel worthless compared to her.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.720
Why? She's not my new wife.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.480
No, but she's a person.
She's a nice person.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.640
-We told her that after you left.
-Good.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.120
While you were doing that,
I threw the cactus through a car window

06:26.200 --> 06:27.640
that didn't stop at a zebra crossing.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.480
Brilliant. You can cover that
when I get the call about it later.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.480
-That's what you get.
-What do you mean?

06:34.000 --> 06:37.160
I didn't want to do the stupid soiree.
I was doing it for you.

06:37.240 --> 06:39.960
-You were making life more interesting.
-My fault, yeah.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.400
-We've both learned a lesson, haven't we?
-Which is?

06:42.480 --> 06:43.920
Never help anyone, ever.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.480
-Great. Great lesson.
-Yeah.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.160
Seriously, Tony, you need to do something
about your anger.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.240
It's gonna kill you one of these days.
Or someone else.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.800
Why don't you channel it into sport
or something? You used to do loads.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.640
Now you've let yourself go.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.960
You know, staying up drinking every night.
God knows what else. It'll do you good.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.400
-I have let myself go.
-Yeah.

07:06.480 --> 07:09.560
Yeah, and I tell you this,
I could drink half a bottle of whiskey

07:09.640 --> 07:11.600
and still beat you at anything physical.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.920
-Don't be silly.
-Course I could.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.600
-Don't be silly.
-What, then?

07:14.680 --> 07:16.120
-Table tennis?

07:16.200 --> 07:17.040
-Fine.
-Yeah?

07:17.120 --> 07:18.480
-Yeah.
-Not a lot of running.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.360
No, no, it's fine. Don't worry about it.
Money on it? Money on it?

07:21.440 --> 07:22.440
-Okay?
-Why not?

07:22.520 --> 07:23.760
-100 quid.
-No, that's too--

07:23.840 --> 07:26.160
-Okay, yeah, all right, fine, 100 quid.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.160
Yeah, let's do it.

07:27.240 --> 07:31.280
I'll, um, phone the rackets club.
They've got a few table-- Oh, sorry, yeah.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.480
Um--

07:32.560 --> 07:36.680
Uh, this is Coleen, uh, the new intern.
She's Sandy's replacement. This is Tony.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.520
-You all right?
-No, not really.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.240
I'm absolutely gutted.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.560
I'm starting at the bottom again. I worked
my way up to management in my old job.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.160
-Where was your old job?
-At the mini-mart.

07:47.240 --> 07:50.640
But it went bust during the pandemic,
so I've had to take anything.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.040
Even though the money's shit
and I don't know what I'm doing.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.960
Well, we're all in the same boat, then.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.400
Oh really?
Do you live with your alcoholic mum

08:00.480 --> 08:03.520
'cause your dad's in prison
for beating up her brother who groped you?

08:07.880 --> 08:10.200
Okay, so, um,
if you want to show her the ropes…

08:12.280 --> 08:13.960
Oh, right.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.880
Do you want to come and watch us
interview some swingers?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.080
What's that?

08:20.680 --> 08:21.520
What, swingers?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.960
All of it.
I don't understand anything you just said.

08:26.280 --> 08:32.640
Um, well-- Well, I'm a journalist
for the newspaper. Yeah?

08:32.720 --> 08:37.040
So I talk to people
who've got an interesting story.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.760
-Okay, why?
-Why?

08:39.840 --> 08:40.800
Yeah.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.520
Why do I talk to them?
Or why do I do any of it?

08:44.440 --> 08:45.600
Yeah.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.960
Just-- just, uh-- Just come with us.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.120
Wow.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.320
I'm Geoff, and this is my partner, Vera.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.080
Hi. Um, thanks for inviting us over.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.680
Uh, so what is
the swingers club all about?

09:07.320 --> 09:08.760
-Fun.
-Yeah.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.400
-Via sex.
-Yeah.

09:11.560 --> 09:15.440
I work at the crematorium,
which can be quite

09:16.880 --> 09:21.560
boring and stuff, you know,
so, um, I like to let my hair down.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.400
Hmm, he gets so frustrated.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.520
I mean, so pent up.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.520
-He has to let it out.
-Yeah.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.440
Yeah.

09:30.520 --> 09:35.840
So we, uh-- We started this.
Um, all above board, legal age.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.160
Oh, way over legal age.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.280
Yeah, and all consensual.
We ask permission for everything.

09:41.360 --> 09:46.160
No funny business,
and everything is 100% safe.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.440
Condoms are compulsory.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.040
No filming or photos.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.240
We call it the Vegas Club.

09:52.760 --> 09:56.320
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
Have you heard that?

09:56.400 --> 09:58.640
Yeah. But you're happy
for it to be in the paper?

09:58.720 --> 10:00.760
Yeah. Fine with us.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.320
But I won't give you
photos of other members.

10:03.400 --> 10:06.920
Don't want them to be recognized
in the street if they don't want to be.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.080
It's a lovely private club
for people who like a bit of fun.

10:11.640 --> 10:14.320
Nothing weird about it.
Can't stress that enough.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.600
-What it is, is it's a celebration.
-Yeah.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.240
Yeah? Of body sharing.

10:19.920 --> 10:24.000
But if someone
doesn't want full-on intercourse,

10:24.720 --> 10:25.560
that is fine.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.320
It's like our Mrs. Polden, yeah?

10:28.400 --> 10:30.480
-She just likes Geoff to stroke it.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.360
-She loves it.
-Hmm.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.280
Up to her.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.240
Whereas her husband, Norman,
he wants everything up him, doesn't he?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.440
-Like what?
-No.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.800
-No?
-Dildos.

10:42.720 --> 10:43.920
-Right.
-Mainly.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.520
He brings his own.
They're not used on anyone else.

10:46.600 --> 10:50.160
Hygiene is paramount. You can write that.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.240
Yeah.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.800
So how do people join?

10:58.720 --> 11:01.360
Well, they just come along.
They don't even have to join in.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.640
They can just watch the first time
to get the idea.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.560
-Would you like to join?
-No. Thank you.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.120
-No. Not my-- No.
-Sure?

11:10.200 --> 11:13.160
-Yeah.
-Well, you'd be very welcome.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.720
We have all sorts
if that's what you're worried about.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.000
-Even got a little Chinese fella.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.880
Lovely Kim. He goes like the clappers,
he does. Doesn't he?

11:21.960 --> 11:24.000
Oh. So fast. Good luck to him.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.680
Anyway, as Geoff said, you know,
you can just watch if you want to.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.840
-No.
-Yeah, like Mary Biddle.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.640
Oh, God rest her soul.

11:33.720 --> 11:34.720
Yeah.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.680
-She was wheelchair-bound…
-Hmm.

11:36.760 --> 11:41.080
…but we used to pop her in the corner
and she'd watch.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.800
Yeah, she couldn't do much else.

11:42.880 --> 11:43.960
She could help herself.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.720
Yeah. Yeah. She had the one good hand.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.760
-Now, do you want to take a picture?
-Yeah.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.440
-Smile.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.680
Great.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.240
-All right?
-Hiya.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.880
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.880
What were the swingers like?

12:10.760 --> 12:11.600
Horrible.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.760
I kept wanting to say,
"Sorry. Why are you telling us all this?"

12:15.840 --> 12:17.640
"Keep it to yourself. It's weird."

12:18.160 --> 12:21.400
At least they've had a life.
I've got absolutely nothing.

12:21.920 --> 12:25.320
You know, I haven't even got a boyfriend,
and I'm fucking easy.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.640
There's no rush.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.480
I didn't meet my wife
till I was in my thirties.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.840
-Your wife died, didn't she?
-Yeah.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.320
Hmm. Really sorry.

12:38.680 --> 12:39.520
Cheers.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.800
Yeah, I wasn't looking, and there she was.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.640
I was living in a shitty little bedsit
above a launderette.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.840
I could hear the machines
going round all day.

12:51.680 --> 12:55.040
And, uh, if it wasn't for Lisa,
I think I'd still be there.

12:55.120 --> 12:59.120
Uh, I've never had money.
She earned loads more than me.

13:00.040 --> 13:04.000
And her dad lent us the money
for a deposit on the house.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.520
We paid off the mortgage
just before she got ill.

13:06.600 --> 13:10.160
If I didn't own the house,
I'd be living under a bridge now.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.080
Might still be better than my situation.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.400
I'd be happy with a bedsit
at the moment.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.200
I'm looking for a flat,
but money's a bit tight.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.840
You should move in with Tony.
He's got that big house all to himself.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.840
-Yeah, cheers, Kath.
-Wouldn't want to.

13:23.920 --> 13:25.640
Wouldn't want to. Why not?

13:26.680 --> 13:30.400
It's not that I need somewhere to live.
I need somewhere to live on my own.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.960
Like, I need to be independent. I just--

13:33.680 --> 13:34.600
I feel like a loser.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.640
I've got a viewing later.
Would you come with me?

13:38.720 --> 13:40.880
-Why?
-I feel like they talk down to me.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.920
So you need someone fat
and grizzled and middle-aged?

13:45.800 --> 13:46.920
Yeah.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.640
I'm your man.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.200
Always thought
I'd make a good estate agent.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.360
Definitely.
-You know why?

13:54.440 --> 13:56.400
-Cold and uncaring.
-Trustworthy.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.040
-People can tell

13:58.120 --> 14:00.240
-I know what I'm talking about.
-No, they can't.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.280
Oh yeah. I called what's-her-name,
the novelist, medium woman.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.040
She's up for doing
a consultation with you.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.440
Does she do palms, crystal ball, or what?

14:08.520 --> 14:11.040
Said she's gonna read your aura
and tell you what to do.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.400
I hope two people with the gift
don't cancel each other out.

14:15.920 --> 14:16.760
What gift?

14:17.600 --> 14:18.800
I'm a bit psychic.

14:18.880 --> 14:19.920
Oh, are ya?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
No.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.280
-How do you know?
-Bullshit, innit?

14:27.760 --> 14:30.320
-You don't believe in all that nonsense?
-What?

14:30.400 --> 14:33.520
The supernatural.
Mediums, fortune tellers.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.080
Um,

14:35.720 --> 14:36.560
I dunno.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.560
There's gotta be something to it.
It feels like

14:39.640 --> 14:42.440
if it was a con, it'd be illegal,
and they make loads of money.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.640
Yeah, but if it actually worked,

14:44.720 --> 14:47.840
they'd just do the lottery every week,
and they'd be billionaires, wouldn't they?

14:48.640 --> 14:49.640
Huh.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.840
Yeah, that's a good point.

14:50.920 --> 14:54.280
I think it's for people
who are looking for something. Oh.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.120
-Hi.
-Hello.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.960
Sorry I'm late.
An old woman was found dead.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.880
So we've got the dining space,
living room area,

15:10.560 --> 15:11.920
the kitchen,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.640
bedroom.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.520
Very convenient to each other.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.360
In my house, my kitchen's
bloody miles away from my bedroom.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.080
Is this all I can afford?

15:23.760 --> 15:28.040
Well, this is the size you're looking at
for the rent you want to pay.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.320
This is quite a cheap area, too, so it's
bigger than you'll get anywhere else.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.000
What's the area like?

15:35.880 --> 15:36.720
Yeah, uh--

15:37.880 --> 15:42.360
Uh, I wouldn't usually mention this,
but it's full of greasy spoons

15:42.440 --> 15:45.520
and, uh, fast food takeaways,
so, you know…

15:48.000 --> 15:49.280
-Oh my God.
-Yeah.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.840
Okay. Let's go before--

15:50.920 --> 15:52.200
-Lovely.
-Yeah, bye.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.120
-No. I'll see you out.
-Yeah.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.600
-Yeah.
-Lovely.

16:00.640 --> 16:04.120
All right. I'll see you soon?
Yeah? Get all this tied up.

16:17.680 --> 16:18.720
No good?

16:19.320 --> 16:20.240
Depressing.

16:22.840 --> 16:23.760
Here he is.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.800
I've written my TV column. It's all about
Simon Cowell's newest face.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.680
-Cheers.
-Who's this?

16:29.760 --> 16:32.320
Oh, uh, Coleen, this is Ken.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.080
Why so glum?

16:34.760 --> 16:38.120
Where to start. I'm 30.
I live with my alcoholic mum.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.920
And I earn crap money,
so the only way I can be independent

16:41.000 --> 16:42.960
is to live in a tiny hovel above a shop.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.440
Oh, cry me a river.
Thought she'd never stop.

16:45.520 --> 16:49.040
Look, if you're homeless,
I've got a flat above my office.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.360
What? It's empty?

16:50.440 --> 16:53.480
Yeah. I use it to audition the young lads.
Wink, wink.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.480
Or wank, wank, if you get what I mean.

16:55.560 --> 16:58.320
-I think I know what you're suggesting.
-You just said it.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.800
I just stopped all that
when coronavirus came along. Scary.

17:01.880 --> 17:05.040
I preferred AIDS.
You knew where you were with that.

17:05.120 --> 17:07.040
You actually had to do you-know-what
with someone.

17:07.120 --> 17:11.480
Coronavirus? Some fucker just walks
past you and coughs and you're screwed!

17:11.560 --> 17:14.200
Well, I am. I'm high-risk. Asthma.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.840
I was high risk with AIDS.
That's 'cause I liked it up the arse.

17:18.360 --> 17:19.800
My choice!

17:21.440 --> 17:25.040
Anyway, flat's yours if you want it.
I'd change the sheets if I were you.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.120
See ya.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.040
Cheers, Ken.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.720
-Hello.
-Hiya.

17:45.000 --> 17:45.840
Tonic.

17:47.800 --> 17:48.640
And a lemon.

17:48.720 --> 17:49.600
Cheers.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.000
-How's it going?
-Yeah, all right.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.360
Hello, pretty.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.960
Pretty. Hello, pretty girl.

18:01.040 --> 18:04.480
Hello. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Where's the kisses? Who's a good girl?

18:14.200 --> 18:15.040
<i>What?</i>

18:15.120 --> 18:18.480
-<i>Nothing. Don't forget the lemon.</i>
<i>-I won't forget the lemon.</i>

18:24.640 --> 18:26.360
<i>-Who's that?</i>
-<i>Lionel.</i>

18:26.440 --> 18:29.560
<i>Right. Lionel. I can't cut him now, can I?</i>

18:29.640 --> 18:30.880
<i>Or throw him away.</i>

18:31.600 --> 18:32.440
<i>Stop!</i>

18:32.960 --> 18:35.320
<i>Stop drawing faces on the fruit and veg!</i>

18:46.560 --> 18:48.520
I've done you a gin and tonic.

18:48.600 --> 18:52.120
I don't know what you want to do
with the lemon. I'll get you some ice.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.040
Okay.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.520
-You've drawn a face on it?
-That's Lionel.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.440
Dead.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.800
-Are you getting the ice?
-Yeah.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.560
-Only me.
-Bloody hell, Ken. Do you not knock?

19:17.640 --> 19:20.600
Don't worry about that.
You got nothing I want to see. Trust me.

19:20.680 --> 19:24.320
No, I'm gonna be popping in all the time.
Don't you worry. We'll be besties.

19:25.520 --> 19:29.000
I get ever so bored in the office.
There's nothing at all coming in for him.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.760
Oh, the stories I could tell you
about this place.

19:31.840 --> 19:36.240
Absolutely dripping with memories.
Literally dripping. Throw that towel away.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.400
Anyway, I'll let you get on. Ta-ra.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.840
-All right, Brian?
-Mustn't grumble.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.040
Here to see James?

19:48.120 --> 19:50.600
-Where is the little bugger?
-He's in the bath, but come in.

19:50.680 --> 19:51.560
Oy.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.920
-What?
-All right, boy?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.320
-Mum?
-What, love?

20:02.080 --> 20:03.840
-I'm having a bath.
-Good boy.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.480
Bloody steamy in here, innit?

20:05.560 --> 20:09.120
Yeah. Told him he has it too hot.
Bad for his testicles.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.280
Makes you sterile.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.880
Ah. Do you mind?

20:12.840 --> 20:14.360
Yeah, they do look red, mate.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.800
Oh, yeah. Put a bit of cold
on them, James.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.040
Can we stop talking
about my bloody testicles? They're fine.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.560
Some cake, Brian?

20:23.640 --> 20:25.440
-Oh, yes, please. Thank you.
-James?

20:25.520 --> 20:28.520
-I'm having a fucking bath!
-Is that a yes or a no?

20:28.600 --> 20:29.560
What kind of cake?

20:30.240 --> 20:33.120
Chocolate gateau
with crumbled Flakes on top.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.040
Mm.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.080
Yes, then, please.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.640
I've gotta get my own place.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.160
-Why?
-Why?

20:43.880 --> 20:47.320
Living the dream, mate. Wish I had a woman
bringing me cake in the bath.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.920
Not your mum though.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.280
I'm not needed here anymore.
Mum's got Lenny.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.280
I'm just a big, fat lump taking up space.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.920
And your mum shouldn't be telling you off
for ruining your testicles in the bath.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.440
-You can move in with me if you want.
-Really? Do you have a spare room?

21:04.520 --> 21:08.280
-Yeah, if you can get in there.
-What do you mean <i>if </i>I can get in it?

21:08.360 --> 21:09.440
It's full of shit.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.040
You know what?

21:12.640 --> 21:13.480
Let's do it.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.120
Time for me to become a man.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.680
Will you help me break the news to my mum?

21:20.440 --> 21:21.280
Hmm.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.400
Let's see.

21:29.040 --> 21:29.880
Interesting.

21:29.960 --> 21:30.920
What?

21:31.000 --> 21:34.520
Strong, confident, determined

21:35.760 --> 21:37.080
on the outside.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.840
But on the inside,
you're vulnerable and sensitive.

21:44.880 --> 21:45.840
You're lonely.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.960
It's tough, isn't it?
Being a strong woman in a man's world.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.720
You feel you've lost a little of yourself,

21:53.800 --> 21:56.920
and you see needing comfort
as a weakness they'll pounce on.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.440
So you deny you need it.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.600
But you do need it, dear.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.800
Everyone does.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.440
-Mum.
-Yeah?

22:30.320 --> 22:33.680
-I've got something to tell you.
-Oh, I've known for ages, darling.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.120
What?

22:35.640 --> 22:37.720
Oh, sorry, what were you gonna say?

22:38.640 --> 22:41.960
Okay, um, so I think it's time
for me to fly the nest.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.200
Brian's got a spare room.
I'm gonna move in with him.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.080
Okay. Well, I'll help you
move in tomorrow, then.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.440
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah.

22:54.600 --> 22:55.880
Great.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.880
I will go and get dressed, then.

23:01.960 --> 23:02.880
Yeah.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.640
-Aw.
-I know.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.600
I'll put a snooker table in his room.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.640
-It won't fit, will it?
-Just a little one.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.680
You've got the lock on!

23:20.200 --> 23:21.560
Yeah, I'm in bed.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.160
It's Ken.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.520
Yeah, I guessed that.

23:26.200 --> 23:30.680
I've had an idea for a new showbiz
gossip piece called <i>Careless Whispers</i>.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.120
Okay. Tell me tomorrow.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.200
Yeah, it's basically
a list of all the people I know

23:36.280 --> 23:38.760
who claim they've
wanked off George Michael.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.760
Okay. I'm going to sleep.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.480
-Good idea though, isn't it?
-Yeah.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.640
Yeah. Night night.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.280
-Yeah, night, Ken!
-What?

23:45.360 --> 23:47.360
-Night, Ken!
-Yeah, all right.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.920
See you tomorrow.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.120
-See ya.
-See you.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.120
-Don't bother getting up.
-Hmm.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.200
Hmm.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.240
-Cheers.
-Bye.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.160
Bye.
