04:44.022 --> 04:45.763

BECAUSE REMEMBER, THIS IS A
WORKING VESSEL, NOT A CRUISE.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.593
AND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE
GOING FOR JUST TWO WEEKS,

04:49.724 --> 04:51.291

06:40.661 --> 06:43.315
AND THEY REFUSE
TO ACCEPT THEIR NEW FAMILY,

06:43.446 --> 06:45.274
AND THAT THEY'RE NOW BROTHERS.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.276
-AND THEY'RE GOING
ON THIS TRIP TOGETHER?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.539
-WELL, THEIR PARENTS ARE HOPING
THAT A LITTLE TOGETHERNESS

06:49.670 --> 06:51.541
WILL WORK THE WONDERS

06:51.672 --> 06:53.238
-TERRIFIC.

06:53.369 --> 06:55.066
WE'VE GOT TWO FIGHTING
STEP BROTHERS ON THE TRIP.

06:55.197 --> 06:57.025
-[CHUCKLES] YEAH. ONE OF THEM
HAS A HUGE CRUSH ON NEELY.

06:57.155 --> 07:00.332
AND BENJAMIN, I THINK HE'S
GOING TO BE RUNNING FOR CONGRESS

07:00.463 --> 07:01.769
BY NEXT YEAR.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.205
-THIS BENJAMIN IS
SUCH A CHARACTER.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.250
I MEAN, HE HAS THE
I.Q. OF A GENIUS.

07:05.381 --> 07:08.645
UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN HE TRIES
TO MAKE FRIENDS, IT BACKFIRES.

07:09.254 --> 07:10.908
-WHAT ABOUT THAT GIRL, MEGAN?

07:11.039 --> 07:13.084
I MEAN, SHE HASN'T SAID A
WORD SINCE SHE'S BEEN HERE.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.956
WHAT'S HER STORY?

07:15.086 --> 07:17.132
-WELL, HER PARENTS DIED IN A
CAR ACCIDENT WHEN SHE WAS FIVE,

07:17.262 --> 07:19.439
AND SHE AND THE FAMILY DOG WERE
THE ONLY ONES WHO SURVIVED.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.049
WHEN SHE WAS ADOPTED,

07:21.179 --> 07:23.007
SHE WOULDN'T GO UNLESS
THE DOG WAS ADOPTED, TOO.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.879
AND THAT DOG DIED
THREE MONTHS AGO.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.142
SHE WAS JUST DEVASTATED AND
SHE HASN'T SPOKEN A WORD SINCE.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.926
HER ADOPTIVE PARENTS
HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.493
THEY EVEN BOUGHT
HER A NEW PUPPY,

07:30.624 --> 07:32.060
BUT SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.149
SO THEY WERE HOPING THIS
TRIP WOULD HELP HER.

07:34.279 --> 07:37.457
-YOU KNOW, WASN'T IT YOU TWO
THAT SAID THIS WAS GOING TO BE

07:37.587 --> 07:40.721

TO LAST YOU ALL ABOUT A WEEK.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.596
-AND YOU CAN LIVE
OFF FISH AND SEAWEED.

08:29.726 --> 08:30.727
-BOTH: WHAT?

08:30.858 --> 08:32.337
-TRISHA, IT WAS A JOKE.

08:32.467 --> 08:34.775
-COME ON, GIRLS, CARRY
A BAG. EVERYONE WORKS.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.385

FIRST DESCRIBED BY SAILORS

AS NAUSEA, WHICH IS
LATIN FOR SEA SICKNESS.
