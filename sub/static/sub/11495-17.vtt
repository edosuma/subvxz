WEBVTT

00:04.864 --> 00:06.797
Hi, future me.

00:08.704 --> 00:11.974
This is 17-year-old you
in your dorm room at M.I.T.

00:14.310 --> 00:15.743
Yeah, that's right.

00:15.745 --> 00:17.979
I did my own <i>Pop Up Video.</i>

00:17.981 --> 00:19.414
How cool is that?

00:21.419 --> 00:23.550
Still is.

00:23.552 --> 00:26.518
Hopefully you're watching this
from your implanted brain chip,

00:26.520 --> 00:29.987
aka the "Tran-Schmidter,"

00:29.989 --> 00:31.923
running proprietary software

00:31.925 --> 00:34.626
developed by
Walden Schmidt Enterprises.

00:34.628 --> 00:35.829
Failing that,

00:35.831 --> 00:38.132
hopefully you've at least
seen a girl naked.

00:38.134 --> 00:40.535
Hey, what
you watching?

00:40.537 --> 00:41.835
Check this out.

00:41.837 --> 00:44.304
I had all my old videotapes
digitized, and I found this.

00:44.306 --> 00:46.640
Oh, my God,
is that you?

00:47.642 --> 00:49.942
You were nothing more
than an awkward,

00:49.944 --> 00:52.646
pimply-faced,
goofy-looking teenager.

00:54.882 --> 00:57.685
We would've been best friends.

00:58.888 --> 00:59.988
Yeah, I made it

00:59.990 --> 01:01.289
when I was at M.I.T.

01:01.291 --> 01:03.192
It outlines everything
I wanted to accomplish

01:03.194 --> 01:04.760
by the time I turned 35.

01:04.762 --> 01:06.295
Oh, I did
a similar thing.

01:06.297 --> 01:07.998
Well, it wasn't
so much a video as, uh,

01:08.000 --> 01:09.633
something I wrote
on a cocktail napkin.

01:09.635 --> 01:10.801
"Don't kill yourself.

01:10.803 --> 01:12.938
It'll get better."

01:12.940 --> 01:15.707
I was so naive.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.642
I hope you've accomplished
your first goal,

01:18.644 --> 01:21.511
as previously stated,
of seeing a girl naked.

01:21.513 --> 01:23.948
And I'm talking in person.

01:23.950 --> 01:27.186
Which I did a short
18 months later.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.253
Goal number two:

01:28.255 --> 01:29.888
Create your
own software company

01:29.890 --> 01:32.225
that revolutionizes
the industry standard

01:32.227 --> 01:35.962
for information transferral
at blinding speeds.

01:40.270 --> 01:41.368
Hear that?

01:41.370 --> 01:43.170
56k dial-up.

01:43.172 --> 01:44.471
In four hours,

01:44.473 --> 01:47.876
I will have downloaded
the entire Spice Girls album.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.187 --> 01:58.922
After building your company
from the ground up,

01:58.924 --> 02:01.125
you will sell it for...

02:01.127 --> 02:05.096
one million dollars.

02:06.033 --> 02:07.900
Well, that
didn't happen.

02:07.902 --> 02:11.704
I sold it
for one billion dollars.

02:13.875 --> 02:16.942
Yeah, baby!

02:17.777 --> 02:18.744
Don't.

02:18.746 --> 02:20.579
Just...
just don't.

02:22.248 --> 02:23.481
Number three:

02:23.483 --> 02:25.951
live in a beautiful beach house.

02:25.953 --> 02:27.453
Nailed it.

02:27.455 --> 02:29.688
With the love of your life.

02:29.690 --> 02:32.458
Nailed it.

02:34.361 --> 02:36.295
Although it is kind of hard
to meet someone

02:36.297 --> 02:39.599
when you spend 20 hours a day
in the computer lab.

02:46.473 --> 02:48.541
Phyllis is now Phil.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.477
He's a commercial
fisherman in Baton Rouge.

02:51.479 --> 02:54.380
But I'm sure all this hard work
will be worth it someday

02:54.382 --> 02:56.682
when you're watching this video
with your beautiful wife,

02:56.684 --> 03:00.886
four kids, two dogs
and robot butler

03:00.888 --> 03:03.822
developed by
Walden Schmidt Enterprises.

03:03.824 --> 03:05.157
Hello, Walden.

03:05.159 --> 03:08.294
Would you like a root beer?

03:08.296 --> 03:10.029
Heck, yeah.

03:12.632 --> 03:15.034
Where did my life
take such a wrong turn?

03:15.036 --> 03:16.502
What are you talking about?

03:16.504 --> 03:19.606
I don't have any of those things
that matter.

03:19.608 --> 03:21.842
No wife, no kids.

03:21.844 --> 03:23.777
All I have is you.

03:26.281 --> 03:28.782
Well...

03:28.784 --> 03:30.618
we could adopt.

03:52.962 --> 03:54.562
Hey.

03:54.564 --> 03:56.231
Oh, hey.

03:56.233 --> 03:57.500
What are you doing up?

03:57.501 --> 03:59.601
Alan is sleep-sobbing again.

04:01.938 --> 04:04.039
You still
watching this thing?

04:04.041 --> 04:05.407
I'm a failure, Lyndsey.

04:05.409 --> 04:07.276
No, you're not, Walden.

04:07.278 --> 04:09.545
Although you looked
like one in college.

04:11.782 --> 04:12.915
Yeah, I kind of did.

04:12.917 --> 04:14.751
I mean, I wouldn't
have slept with you,

04:14.753 --> 04:16.920
and I slept with everybody.

04:16.922 --> 04:18.188
Got it.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.824
I even slept with
the janitor in my dorm.

04:20.826 --> 04:23.126
Is this supposed
to cheer me up?

04:23.128 --> 04:25.262
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:25.264 --> 04:26.330
I'm sorry.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.065
Look, when I was 18,

04:28.067 --> 04:30.534
I was convinced
I was gonna marry Axl Rose

04:30.536 --> 04:31.669
and have my own TV show.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.404
Well, they don't give
TV shows to people

04:33.406 --> 04:34.906
just 'cause they're
good-looking.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.482
You know, Walden,
just 'cause your life

04:42.484 --> 04:43.950
didn't turn out
the way you thought,

04:43.952 --> 04:45.418
doesn't mean
it's not a success.

04:45.420 --> 04:48.254
I mean, how many people
can say they're a billionaire?

04:48.256 --> 04:50.857
1,226.

04:50.859 --> 04:52.759
Seriously?

04:53.861 --> 04:56.095
That's a lot more
than I thought.

04:56.097 --> 04:57.463
Do you know them all?

04:57.465 --> 04:59.231
Well, there's not
a club or anything.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.602
But Buffett does host a
poker game once a month.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.103
Last time, I won Guatemala.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.305
Wow.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.740
And then I lost
at the end

05:07.742 --> 05:09.041
to the woman who
invented Spanx.

05:09.043 --> 05:11.276
Mmm.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.778
Money doesn't mean anything

05:12.780 --> 05:14.780
if I don't have anyone
to share it with.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.282
Oh, I get that.

05:16.284 --> 05:18.517
But you're not going
to meet anybody

05:18.519 --> 05:21.454
sitting on your couch
feeling sorry for yourself.

05:21.456 --> 05:23.289
Are you?

05:24.124 --> 05:25.925
I guess not.

05:25.927 --> 05:27.326
Damn.

05:27.328 --> 05:30.597
I just don't get
relationships.

05:30.599 --> 05:31.931
Nobody does.

05:31.933 --> 05:34.132
They're scary and messy.

05:34.934 --> 05:37.002
And sometimes
you get involved

05:37.004 --> 05:38.370
with somebody
you don't really like.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.907
And... one day, you find
yourself peeing on a stick,

05:41.909 --> 05:43.275
and the plus sign shows up

05:43.277 --> 05:45.745
and you have to give up
your dreams of being an actress

05:45.747 --> 05:48.014
so you can raise a kid
who can only do math

05:48.016 --> 05:50.483
when he's figuring out
the cost of weed.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.253
Pep talks really aren't
your strong suit, are they?

05:55.589 --> 05:56.989
I'm just saying,

05:56.991 --> 05:59.492
things happen,
but you can't give up.

05:59.494 --> 06:01.193
I mean, if I
had stopped looking,

06:01.195 --> 06:04.063
I never would've found my
amazing, wonderful boyfriend.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.998
Oh, you're
cheating on Alan?

06:11.670 --> 06:12.703
Hey.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.706
Uh, would you eat
expired pudding?

06:23.581 --> 06:25.282
No.

06:25.284 --> 06:26.584
Oh, good.
Then I can have it.

06:27.419 --> 06:29.220
Knock yourself out.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.487
What you doing?

06:30.489 --> 06:33.324
I'm looking for
this card, and I can't...

06:33.326 --> 06:34.959
Ah, there it is.

06:34.961 --> 06:38.629
"Emily's Elite
and Discreet Introductions."

06:38.631 --> 06:40.297
Oh, fancy call girls.

06:40.299 --> 06:41.498
I like it.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.667
No, it's a dating service.

06:43.669 --> 06:44.668
Oh, right.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.870
"Dating service."
Wink-wink.

06:47.638 --> 06:49.206
You know,
I want to like you,

06:49.208 --> 06:51.475
but sometimes
you make it so hard.

06:52.610 --> 06:56.113
"Substantial relationships
for substantial people."

06:56.115 --> 06:57.881
Ah, big girls.

06:58.850 --> 07:02.019
Get your smoosh on.

07:02.021 --> 07:04.922
They throw mixers
for single rich people.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.657
I wouldn't think you'd be
into that kind of thing.

07:06.659 --> 07:08.392
You've always been a...
a "fate" kind of guy.

07:08.394 --> 07:09.993
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna create my own fate.

07:09.995 --> 07:11.028
Lyndsey's right.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.129
I'm not gonna find anyone

07:12.131 --> 07:14.330
sitting around here
feeling sorry for myself.

07:14.332 --> 07:16.132
No, you're not.

07:16.134 --> 07:17.734
Are you?

07:19.236 --> 07:21.337
What?
Nothing.

07:21.339 --> 07:22.539
Hey, uh, can I go along?

07:22.541 --> 07:24.341
No, you have Lyndsey.

07:24.343 --> 07:25.642
I'd be doing it for her.

07:25.644 --> 07:28.346
Look, I'll find a rich,
90-year-old woman

07:28.348 --> 07:29.480
with a bad ticker,

07:29.482 --> 07:31.048
give her the best three minutes
of her life,

07:31.050 --> 07:33.016
and then, you know,
send her out with a bang...

07:34.118 --> 07:36.954
...then spend
my inheritance on Lyndsey.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.990
Or whatever's left
after my grief cruise.

07:41.026 --> 07:44.228
Again, you make it really hard
to like you.

07:45.263 --> 07:47.030
I just want
a sugar mama.

07:47.032 --> 07:48.065
Yeah, you have one.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.267
Her name is Walden.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.144
Walden, we have a
great mixer tonight.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.547
I hope you're ready to meet
some substantial women.

08:01.549 --> 08:04.883
Yep, I'm ready
to get my smoosh on.

08:06.385 --> 08:08.153
I'm sorry.
I'm just really nervous.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.988
Don't be.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.757
Everyone here is rich
and looking for love.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.058
The only woman
in this room

08:13.060 --> 08:14.793
who wants you for
your money is me.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.928
Happy mingling.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.863
Okay.

08:26.038 --> 08:28.106
Hello.

08:28.941 --> 08:30.642
Hello.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.976
Trust fund or tech?

08:31.978 --> 08:33.144
Excuse me?

08:33.145 --> 08:34.345
The way you're dressed means

08:34.347 --> 08:36.080
you're either the beneficiary
of a trust fund

08:36.082 --> 08:37.214
or in the tech business.

08:37.216 --> 08:38.248
Unless you're working here,

08:38.250 --> 08:39.750
in which case
I need another drink.

08:39.751 --> 08:41.585
Ac-Actually, I'm in tech.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.254
I started my own company
when I was...

08:43.256 --> 08:44.822
What do your
Fridays look like?

08:44.824 --> 08:49.127
Uh, a lot like my Thursdays,
just one day later.

08:50.296 --> 08:51.596
A sense of humor.

08:51.598 --> 08:54.232
Some people find
that attractive.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.302
Are you one of them?

08:58.171 --> 08:59.371
I love to laugh.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.473
Now, I've got
Friday evenings,

09:01.475 --> 09:03.275
Sunday afternoons
and ski season.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.610
How does that
work for you?

09:04.612 --> 09:05.845
What...? So...

09:05.847 --> 09:07.646
Don't you want
to at least know my name?

09:07.648 --> 09:09.582
Really?

09:09.584 --> 09:11.517
We have to do all this?

09:12.553 --> 09:13.953
All right,
I'm Sylvia Miller,

09:13.955 --> 09:16.422
and I'm the CEO of a major
pharmaceutical company.

09:16.424 --> 09:18.057
Wow, very impressive.
Yes.

09:18.059 --> 09:21.594
Every time you get an erection,
you owe me ten dollars.

09:22.629 --> 09:23.763
See? Sense of humor.

09:23.765 --> 09:25.665
Now, Fridays and Sundays.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.567
I just thought maybe we could

09:27.569 --> 09:29.135
spend some time
getting to know each...

09:29.137 --> 09:30.436
Nice talking to you.

09:31.806 --> 09:34.675
Okay, I'll put her
on the "maybe" pile.

09:34.677 --> 09:35.877
Hi.

09:35.879 --> 09:36.945
How you doing?

09:36.947 --> 09:38.646
Oh, hi. I'm Walden Schmidt.

09:38.648 --> 09:39.781
Nice to meet you.

09:39.783 --> 09:41.149
TC Randall.

09:42.385 --> 09:44.253
You're <i>the</i> TC Randall?

09:44.255 --> 09:48.123
Author of Throgwarten
Middle School Mysteries?

09:48.125 --> 09:49.992
I-I've read all your books.

09:49.994 --> 09:51.160
Really?

09:51.162 --> 09:52.661
Yeah, I... Who hasn't?

09:52.663 --> 09:55.297
Grown men.

09:55.299 --> 09:56.966
Their loss.

09:56.968 --> 09:58.367
I mean, you're-you're
an amazing author.

09:58.369 --> 09:59.668
Thank you.

09:59.670 --> 10:02.171
Oh, you know, I do have
one question, though.

10:02.173 --> 10:05.574
In-in book three, the
dragons inexplicably

10:05.576 --> 10:07.111
lose their ability
to breathe fire

10:07.113 --> 10:08.579
when clearly, in book two,

10:08.581 --> 10:09.946
the wizards gave
them that ability.

10:09.948 --> 10:11.648
Was that a setup

10:11.650 --> 10:14.051
for book four
or an oversight?

10:14.053 --> 10:16.888
They're children's books.

10:16.890 --> 10:19.123
Well, it says on the cover

10:19.125 --> 10:22.693
they're for wizards, dragon
trainers and kids of all ages.

10:22.695 --> 10:24.962
Okay, you're right.
I'm sorry.

10:24.964 --> 10:29.100
Um, the dragons lost
their ability to breathe fire

10:29.102 --> 10:30.535
in the Caverns of Chaos.

10:30.537 --> 10:31.703
Ah, come on.

10:31.705 --> 10:33.838
They didn't even go
to the Caverns of Chaos

10:33.840 --> 10:36.441
until they solved the
mystery of the missing map.

10:36.443 --> 10:38.009
All right, you know what?

10:38.011 --> 10:41.112
When I wrote those books,
I was addicted to painkillers.

10:41.114 --> 10:44.249
They make no sense, but they
make me a ton of money,

10:44.251 --> 10:46.418
so cut me some slack.

10:48.621 --> 10:51.256
Probably got the painkillers
from the pharmaceutical chick.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.627
So, any luck so far?

10:55.629 --> 10:56.627
No, not yet.

10:56.629 --> 10:57.829
Oh, well, don't worry.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.130
There are plenty
of women here.

10:59.132 --> 11:00.764
Well, how about them?

11:00.766 --> 11:02.566
Um, Sarah's oil money, uh,

11:02.568 --> 11:04.768
Stephanie is a tobacco heiress,

11:04.770 --> 11:08.205
and Amy had sex with a senator
and owns the video.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.607
Oh, my God.

11:10.609 --> 11:13.043
I don't care how;
I care how much.

11:13.045 --> 11:16.614
Uh, no. The... woman
in the green dress.

11:16.616 --> 11:20.152
I used to be
married to her.

11:20.154 --> 11:21.253
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

11:21.255 --> 11:23.555
I-I try to avoid
situations like this.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.590
No. You know what?
It's fine. I'll...

11:25.592 --> 11:27.225
I'll just go
say hello.

11:27.227 --> 11:29.427
Sure. What's the worst
that can happen?

11:29.429 --> 11:31.462
She's already got
half your money.

11:41.439 --> 11:42.973
Bridget?

11:42.975 --> 11:44.775
Walden?

11:44.777 --> 11:47.011
What are you doing here?

11:47.013 --> 11:49.480
Just... drinking a beer,

11:49.482 --> 11:51.481
losing faith in humanity,

11:51.483 --> 11:53.183
planning to die alone.

11:53.185 --> 11:56.186
I get it.
These people are awful.

11:56.188 --> 11:59.256
The last guy I talked to
offered to give me a boob job.

11:59.258 --> 12:00.557
A plastic surgeon?

12:00.559 --> 12:03.259
Unfortunately, no.

12:03.261 --> 12:05.027
So, you haven't met
anyone, either?

12:05.029 --> 12:07.764
No. I'm actually thinking
about going next door.

12:07.766 --> 12:10.867
The Goldberg Bar Mitzvah
seems like it's going off.

12:10.869 --> 12:12.335
Mmm. Well, good luck to you.

12:12.337 --> 12:14.470
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

12:15.906 --> 12:19.408
So, did I find what
I was looking for?

12:19.410 --> 12:20.643
Oh, yeah.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.845
So...
Yeah.

12:32.847 --> 12:35.314
That happened.

12:35.316 --> 12:36.849
Twice.

12:36.851 --> 12:38.651
Three for me.

12:38.653 --> 12:40.319
Oh, that's great.
Yeah.

12:40.321 --> 12:41.720
The third time, I thought
you were screaming

12:41.722 --> 12:43.289
just 'cause I was
on your hair.

12:45.092 --> 12:47.860
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

12:47.862 --> 12:49.629
What does this mean?

12:49.631 --> 12:51.898
It means
we both paid $1,000

12:51.900 --> 12:54.134
to meet someone
we already slept with.

12:56.638 --> 12:58.605
Wait, you paid $1,000?

12:58.607 --> 13:00.139
I paid $2,000.

13:00.141 --> 13:03.343
Looks like you got screwed
a lot tonight.

13:05.046 --> 13:07.013
The answer is...

13:07.015 --> 13:09.015
I don't know
what it means.

13:09.017 --> 13:10.884
I just know
it feels right.

13:10.886 --> 13:12.151
It does.

13:12.153 --> 13:14.053
Which is odd
because we just did

13:14.055 --> 13:16.756
a couple things that
were very, very wrong.

13:16.758 --> 13:18.992
So, how do we
make sure

13:18.994 --> 13:21.428
we don't end up
where we were before?

13:21.430 --> 13:22.896
Well, that's...

13:22.898 --> 13:24.464
Everything that happened
before was your fault,

13:24.466 --> 13:26.199
so it's kind of up to you.

13:28.102 --> 13:31.238
I'm a different person than
I was when we split up.

13:31.240 --> 13:32.506
That's good.

13:32.508 --> 13:33.707
'Cause towards the end,

13:33.709 --> 13:35.676
I felt more like your mother
than your wife.

13:35.678 --> 13:39.079
Oh, you're a much better
kisser than my mom.

13:39.081 --> 13:41.182
So are you.

13:41.184 --> 13:43.117
Uh, the truth is...

13:43.119 --> 13:45.086
I've grown up
a lot since then.

13:45.088 --> 13:47.656
I don't need anyone
to take care of me now.

13:47.658 --> 13:50.592
So I don't have to check under
the bed for monsters anymore?

13:50.594 --> 13:53.027
No, of course not.
Alan does that.

13:53.029 --> 13:55.596
Does Alan do this?

13:55.598 --> 13:57.766
Yes.

13:57.768 --> 13:59.968
Well...

14:00.837 --> 14:03.439
Uh, he does not do that.

14:06.610 --> 14:09.579
Can't believe you guys
are back together.

14:09.581 --> 14:11.915
Walden and Bridget.
Bridget and Walden.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.082
And Alan.

14:13.084 --> 14:14.851
The... three musketeers.

14:14.853 --> 14:15.852
Or three's a crowd.

14:15.854 --> 14:16.886
Or three's company.

14:16.888 --> 14:18.254
Or three strikes
and you're out.

14:19.323 --> 14:21.824
Okay, okay. Just play nice.

14:22.893 --> 14:25.194
Sorry.

14:25.196 --> 14:26.862
So, uh, Bridget, uh...

14:26.864 --> 14:28.664
after you and Walden broke up,

14:28.666 --> 14:31.167
didn't you immediately
start dating his best friend

14:31.169 --> 14:32.334
and business partner, Billy?

14:32.336 --> 14:34.069
I did, but in
hindsight, I realize

14:34.071 --> 14:36.372
it was just a pathetic
attempt to stay close

14:36.374 --> 14:37.573
to Walden.

14:37.575 --> 14:39.508
You know what that's
like, don't you, Alan?

14:40.945 --> 14:44.380
All right, that was a good one.

14:45.749 --> 14:47.516
What are you eating?

14:47.518 --> 14:50.386
Oh. It's a bacon,
egg and cheese sandwich

14:50.388 --> 14:52.155
with pancakes as the bread.

14:52.157 --> 14:54.191
I call it a McWalden.

14:54.193 --> 14:56.727
I call it a McBypass.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.063
It has all
the basic food groups:

14:59.065 --> 15:01.532
protein, dairy...

15:01.534 --> 15:03.134
syrup.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.770
If you don't eat properly,

15:04.772 --> 15:07.306
your immune system
can't do its job.

15:07.308 --> 15:09.008
I have had more colds this year.

15:09.010 --> 15:11.877
See? I'm gonna pour you a glass

15:11.879 --> 15:14.013
of fresh orange juice
to wash that down.

15:14.015 --> 15:15.881
She's doing it again.

15:15.883 --> 15:17.283
What?

15:17.285 --> 15:18.584
Telling you what to do.

15:18.586 --> 15:21.286
She just cares about me.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.288
Shut up.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.590
Here you go.

15:24.592 --> 15:26.592
Okay, I think
you're all done with that.

15:26.594 --> 15:28.027
Oh, um, actually,
I was not...

15:28.029 --> 15:29.228
Drink your juice.
Okay.

15:29.230 --> 15:30.396
And when you're done,

15:30.398 --> 15:32.093
I want you to go upstairs
and make your bed.

15:32.118 --> 15:32.733
Mmm.

15:32.734 --> 15:33.934
But Berta does it.

15:33.936 --> 15:35.235
No buts.

15:35.237 --> 15:37.370
Okay.

15:37.372 --> 15:40.273
Run...

15:45.746 --> 15:50.282
I'm so... glad that we
found each other again.

15:50.284 --> 15:52.451
Me, too.

15:53.853 --> 15:56.187
I want to try something.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.891
Whatever it is, I am in.

15:58.893 --> 16:00.459
It's pretty extreme.

16:00.461 --> 16:02.662
Oh, yay!

16:04.465 --> 16:06.299
Are you ready
to have your mind blown?

16:06.301 --> 16:08.868
Among other things.

16:12.807 --> 16:17.110
Let's... wait.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.313
For what?

16:21.315 --> 16:24.851
Let's not have sex tonight.

16:24.853 --> 16:27.219
Let's wait.

16:28.021 --> 16:31.423
I'm not sure
that I follow.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.659
Imagine how much deeper

16:33.661 --> 16:36.295
we could connect
on an emotional level

16:36.297 --> 16:38.631
if we weren't prisoners
of our pelvis.

16:38.633 --> 16:40.733
But I like that prison.

16:40.735 --> 16:44.337
I just... I just don't
want to be in solitary.

16:44.339 --> 16:45.805
I'm serious, Walden.

16:45.807 --> 16:48.908
I want sex to be more
than just a physical release.

16:48.910 --> 16:51.144
I want it
to be a special event.

16:51.146 --> 16:54.314
Okay, are we talking
special event like...

16:54.316 --> 16:56.315
Monday Night Football?

16:56.317 --> 16:59.519
Or special event
like Halley's Comet?

16:59.521 --> 17:01.488
I'll let you know.

17:01.490 --> 17:04.557
But in the meantime,
there's other stuff we could do.

17:04.559 --> 17:06.992
Oh, I like other stuff.

17:06.994 --> 17:08.694
What do you have in mind?

17:08.696 --> 17:10.396
We can cuddle.

17:11.232 --> 17:13.333
Cuddle?

17:13.335 --> 17:15.234
I think it would really
help us connect.

17:15.237 --> 17:17.570
Let's try it.

17:17.573 --> 17:20.607
Mmm.

17:20.608 --> 17:23.276
See? Isn't this nice?

17:23.278 --> 17:25.178
Mmm, mmm.

17:25.180 --> 17:28.881
This is... so much better
than having nasty old sex.

17:28.883 --> 17:30.416
Mm-hmm.

17:30.418 --> 17:32.652
This is...

17:32.654 --> 17:35.121
Mmm.

17:38.859 --> 17:42.229
So, how do we know
when we're done?

17:46.067 --> 17:47.734
There you are, Alan.

17:47.736 --> 17:50.537
Come. Join us, please.

17:54.809 --> 17:56.976
Oh, this can't be good.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.682
So, uh...

18:02.684 --> 18:03.783
what's going on?

18:03.785 --> 18:05.584
Walden.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.126
Um...

18:13.128 --> 18:15.362
first, I would
like to say

18:15.364 --> 18:17.831
that I appreciate

18:17.833 --> 18:20.501
what a great
friend you are.

18:20.503 --> 18:23.270
Thank you?

18:23.272 --> 18:27.074
Uh, which
makes it hard for me...

18:27.076 --> 18:30.577
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

18:30.579 --> 18:32.245
Bridget feels that...

18:32.247 --> 18:34.847
We feel...

18:34.849 --> 18:38.017
that you living here is
no longer beneficial

18:38.019 --> 18:41.820
to the goals of
this household.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.623
Buh-bye.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.560
Fine, fine.

18:47.562 --> 18:50.463
Let me just
say one thing.

18:50.465 --> 18:52.398
Okay, when you guys broke up
the first time,

18:52.400 --> 18:54.300
it's because Bridget
thought you were a child.

18:54.302 --> 18:56.636
Turns out she's the one
who keeps you a child

18:56.638 --> 18:58.470
by controlling
everything you do.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.338
Nuh-uh.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.540
Mark my words.

19:01.542 --> 19:03.475
Next, she'll start
withholding sex.

19:05.411 --> 19:07.813
You'll be like a dog
begging for a bone.

19:07.815 --> 19:09.415
Or a dog with a bone.

19:09.417 --> 19:12.318
Either way,
a bone will be involved.

19:14.188 --> 19:16.022
Why is Zippy so upset?

19:16.024 --> 19:17.824
Walden asked him
to move out.

19:17.826 --> 19:20.294
It's about time.

19:20.296 --> 19:21.295
Hey, Berta?

19:21.297 --> 19:22.463
Yeah?

19:22.465 --> 19:24.398
Um, why don't
you have a seat?

19:24.400 --> 19:26.600
Ah, crap.

19:36.777 --> 19:38.845
Hi, sleepyhead.

19:38.847 --> 19:40.247
Hi.

19:40.249 --> 19:41.715
Isn't this nice?

19:41.717 --> 19:43.550
Just the two of us?

19:43.552 --> 19:46.019
I'm a little groggy.

19:46.021 --> 19:47.287
What happened?

19:47.289 --> 19:50.056
I have a little
surprise for you.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.892
Oh.

19:51.894 --> 19:53.761
What is it?

19:57.099 --> 19:59.100
My balls?

19:59.102 --> 20:00.668
No, sweetie.

20:00.670 --> 20:03.237
My balls.

20:14.916 --> 20:16.317
How'd it go with
your ex-wife?

20:16.319 --> 20:17.618
It was a nightmare.

20:17.620 --> 20:19.587
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

20:26.630 --> 20:29.299
Uh, hello, future Alan Harper.

20:29.301 --> 20:31.802
Uh, it's you from the past,

20:31.804 --> 20:35.439
uh, outlining my goals
for the next 50 years.

20:35.441 --> 20:38.341
Uh, I hope this finds you still

20:38.343 --> 20:40.510
on this comfortable couch,

20:40.512 --> 20:42.746
in this lovely beach house,

20:42.748 --> 20:45.181
um, hopefully, uh, with Walden

20:45.183 --> 20:48.018
or whoever moves in after him.

20:49.888 --> 20:52.056
Nailed it.

20:53.358 --> 20:54.958
What?

20:54.960 --> 20:56.894
I-I said,

20:56.896 --> 20:59.863
"Nailed it."

21:03.536 --> 21:06.637
If you want coffee,
go make coffee!

21:08.574 --> 21:10.174
Buffalo!
