PAT RILEY:
<i>You spend your whole career</i>

00:03.628 --> 00:05.255
knowing it's all
gonna be over someday,

00:05.338 --> 00:08.216
<i>but you never really know</i>
<i>what "over" is gonna feel like.</i>

00:08.299 --> 00:09.259
-(SHUTTER CLICK)
-(BUZZER)

00:09.342 --> 00:11.386
-How do I sound?
-Depressing.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.224
Whole thing out here ain't like
how I thought it was gonna be.

00:16.307 --> 00:17.517
Stop acting like a bumpkin.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.687
You gotta do it like OJ do.
Stay righteous, brother.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.021
Yeah, right on.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.899
This team has not
turned a profit for ten years.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.736
There is three million cash
due in two months.

00:27.819 --> 00:28.820
It's a bump in the road.

00:29.904 --> 00:32.115
If it weren't
covering a landmine.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.244
JERRY BUSS:<i> You can't</i>
<i>get anywhere in this world...</i>

00:38.329 --> 00:40.123
if you are afraid to fall.
