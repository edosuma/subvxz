WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:02.306
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.350 --> 00:04.265
ONCE WE KILL THEIR PRIMES,
WE TAKE OVER SANCTUM.

00:04.874 --> 00:06.876
I THAT YOUR IDEA
OR SHEIDHEDA'S?

00:07.181 --> 00:08.269
WHO CARES IF IT WORKS?

00:08.312 --> 00:11.141
UNH!

00:11.185 --> 00:12.708
-UNH!
-AAH!

00:12.751 --> 00:14.666
-JORDAN?
-LOCK THE CHILD UP
WITH THE OTHERS

00:14.710 --> 00:16.233
JOSEPHINE: CLARKE'S
ALIVE,

00:16.277 --> 00:17.539
BUT THE BRAIN WE
NOW SHARE IS DYING.

00:17.582 --> 00:18.844
FIND GABRIEL.
HE WAS ONE OF THEM.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.585
BELLAMY: STAY SAFE.
ECHO: SAVE CLARKE.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.022
JADE: THEY'RE NOT TALKING.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.284
PUT THEM
WITH THE OTHERS.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.633
AGH!

00:24.676 --> 00:26.548
IT'S JOSEPHINE.

00:26.591 --> 00:29.072
CLARKE, SHE GAVE
YOU CONTROL?
YOU GOT TO RUN.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.378
NO. I'M NOT
LEAVING YOU.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.858
GO FIND GABRIEL NOW!

00:32.902 --> 00:34.077
WHY CAN I SEE YOU?

00:34.121 --> 00:35.644
BECAUSE IT'S GETTING WORSE.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.211
GIVE ME BACK CONTROL.
I'LL JUST GET IT ANYWAY

00:37.254 --> 00:38.255
WHEN YOU FALL ASLEEP.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.561
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

00:39.604 --> 00:41.432
GABRIEL, MY NAME IS
CLARKE GRIFFIN.

00:41.476 --> 00:42.738
JOSEPHINE LIGHTBOURNE
IS IN MY HEAD.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.827
IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS,
WE'RE COMING TO YOU.

00:51.573 --> 00:54.576
JOSEPHINE: BE CAREFUL.
WE'RE CLOSE TO THE CAMP NOW.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.621
WHEN GABRIEL HEARS
THE ENGINES, HE'LL--

00:56.665 --> 00:58.493
CLARKE: QUIET.
I'M CONCENTRATING.

01:01.626 --> 01:05.761
OHH. UNH! UGH!

01:05.804 --> 01:06.936
OHH.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.034
JOSEPHINE: TOLD YOU
I SHOULD DRIVE.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.603
NOW WILL YOU GIVE ME
BACK CONTROL,

01:21.646 --> 01:23.474
OR DO I HAVE TO
WAIT UNTIL YOU
FALL ASLEEP?

01:23.518 --> 01:27.435
SHUT UP. I HAVE TO
CALL GABRIEL.

01:27.478 --> 01:28.914
YEAH. YOU BROKE
THAT, TOO.

01:31.265 --> 01:34.355
-I HAVE TO HIDE.
-OK. HERE'S THE DEAL.

01:34.398 --> 01:35.617
IF WE GO BACK
TO SANCTUM,

01:35.660 --> 01:39.490
I'LL GIVE YOU
YOUR BODY BACK.

01:39.534 --> 01:42.145
FINE! WE CAN JUST
WAIT FOR MY GUARDS
TO FIND US.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.494
IT SHOULDN'T BE
LONG NOW.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.670
WE DON'T KNOW THAT
THEY'RE YOUR PEOPLE.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.630
WHAT IF THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL TOOK OUT
YOUR GUARDS?

01:48.673 --> 01:51.546
I MEAN, THEY DO
KIND OF SUCK.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.896
YOU WANT TO RISK
LOSING OUR HEAD?

02:01.686 --> 02:04.472
I SWEAR TO GOD,
IF YOU'RE LYING,

02:04.515 --> 02:06.256
I'LL TAKE OUT
THE MIND DRIVE MYSELF

02:06.300 --> 02:08.258
AND DESTROY IT
BEFORE I DIE.

02:08.302 --> 02:10.652
YEESH. TENSE MUCH? RELAX.

02:10.695 --> 02:13.350
JUST KEEP YOUR EYES
MOVING ALL AROUND
SO I CAN SEE.

02:13.394 --> 02:16.745
WE'RE LOOKING FOR...THIS.

02:16.788 --> 02:18.877
CLEAR THE LEAVES.
YOU'LL FIND A HATCH.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.723
MAN: WHOA.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.595
WOMAN: KEEP YOUR HELMETS ON
AND YOUR GUNS READY.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.205
THESE ARE
THE ENEMY'S WOODS.

02:42.249 --> 02:45.774
I GUESS MY
GUARDS DON'T SUCK
AFTER ALL, HUH?

02:47.906 --> 02:49.691
STOP DOING THAT.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.432
MAN: THE ENGINE'S
STILL WARM.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.042
SHE CAN'T BE FAR.

02:53.085 --> 02:54.783
THERE SHOULD BE
A LIGHT OR SOME
MATCHES

02:54.826 --> 02:56.524
IN THE SUPPLY KIT.

02:56.567 --> 02:59.091
WE LAY LOW HERE
UNTIL THEY PASS.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.615
THEN WE GO ON FOOT.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.756
MAN: SPREAD OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.804
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

03:15.847 --> 03:18.023
OBSERVATION BLIND.
WE BUILT THEM ALL OVER.

03:18.067 --> 03:22.854
I USE THEM TO STUDY
SPECIES IN THEIR
NATURAL HABITAT.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.552
STUDYING, HUH?

03:24.595 --> 03:26.728
RESEARCH CAN GET
BORING.

03:26.771 --> 03:30.906
GABRIEL HELPED
WITH THAT.

03:30.949 --> 03:32.864
YOU GUYS SEEM TO HAVE
A LOT OF HISTORY.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.910
WHY DOES HE WANT TO
KILL YOU NOW?

03:34.953 --> 03:38.348
-HE DOESN'T.
-REALLY? DEATH TO PRIMES?

03:38.392 --> 03:39.697
COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.873
IT'S NOT LITERAL.

03:41.917 --> 03:45.268
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL
CONSIDER THEMSELVES
ENLIGHTENED,

03:45.312 --> 03:47.618
FREEING MINDS
ONE AT A TIME.

03:47.662 --> 03:48.880
IN THE 70 YEARS
SINCE HE LEFT,

03:48.924 --> 03:54.016
THEY'VE KILLED
EXACTLY NO PRIMES.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.931
WHY DID HE LEAVE?

03:55.974 --> 03:58.803
HE WANTED TO BE
ABLE TO DIE.

03:58.847 --> 04:03.678
I DIDN'T.
SIMPLE AS THAT.

04:03.721 --> 04:07.812
WHY? WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING?

04:07.856 --> 04:11.207
I'M THINKING IT'S NOT
AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.078
I'M THINKING

04:13.122 --> 04:15.646
THAT HE LOST HIS TASTE
FOR BODY SNATCHING,

04:15.690 --> 04:17.909
AND I'M HOPING
FOR ALL OUR SAKES

04:17.953 --> 04:20.216
THAT HE DOESN'T DESTROY
YOUR MIND DRIVE

04:20.260 --> 04:21.783
AS SOON AS HE
TAKES IT OUT.

04:21.826 --> 04:23.872
HMM. BELLAMY'S PLAN--

04:23.915 --> 04:26.918
SAVE YOU,
TRADE MY DRIVE
FOR YOUR PEOPLE.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.791
IT WOULD MEAN LETTING YOU
RESURRECT AGAIN.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.794
WOULD HE DO IT?
DOES HE STILL LOVE YOU?

04:38.408 --> 04:40.715
CLARKE?

04:40.758 --> 04:42.630
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

04:42.673 --> 04:44.675
CLARKE? NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.460
NOT NOW.
WE'LL BE STUCK HERE.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.897
THE VINES WILL COME.
THIS IS NOT WHAT I MEANT
BY FALLING ASLEEP.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.855
FIGHT THROUGH IT, CLARKE,
OR I'LL BE LOCKED

04:50.899 --> 04:52.901
INSIDE A DRIVE
INSIDE YOUR HEAD

04:52.944 --> 04:54.816
INSIDE THIS
BOX FOREVER.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.861
WE'RE SO SCREWED.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.203
RAVEN: SIMONE'S GONNA
WANT PAYBACK FOR KANE.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.814
LET'S JUST GET OUR PEOPLE
AND GO BACK TO THE--

05:39.687 --> 05:41.602
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.219
WHERE'S OUR NEW PRIME?

05:50.262 --> 05:54.179
SIMONE: THE FOOL
KILLED HIMSELF, WASTING
A GOOD MIND DRIVE.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.616
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

05:55.659 --> 05:57.313
CAN WE MAKE THE BLOOD
OR NOT?

06:02.884 --> 06:06.496
-PUT THEM WITH THE OTHERS!
-YES, SIR.

06:06.540 --> 06:09.107
HEY. WHAT--
WHAT IS THIS?

06:09.151 --> 06:10.413
HEY. GET OFF ME!

06:10.457 --> 06:11.893
-LET'S GO.
-GET TO IT.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.895
WAIT.

06:13.938 --> 06:16.114
THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE
BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.508
HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW THIS,

06:18.552 --> 06:22.033
BUT YOUR DAUGHTER
IS DEAD, TOO.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.253
WHAT?

06:24.296 --> 06:25.472
I SAID TAKE THEM.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.821
RAVEN: OH. HEY!

06:26.864 --> 06:29.040
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:29.084 --> 06:31.565
NO! WAIT! NO!

06:31.608 --> 06:33.741
THAT WAS UNKIND,
SIMONE,

06:33.784 --> 06:36.787
AND NOT EXACTLY TRUE.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.268
CLARKE'S MIND SURVIVED
THE PROCEDURE.

06:42.271 --> 06:45.535
HER FRIENDS FOUND OUT
AND GOT HER PAST THE SHIELD.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.145
I HAVE TEAMS SEARCHING
THE WOODS,

06:47.189 --> 06:49.147
AND I'M HOLDING
HER PEOPLE AS INSURANCE.

06:49.191 --> 06:51.106
INSURANCE?

06:51.149 --> 06:54.675
OUR DAUGHTER IS GONE,
OUR HOME IS AN ARMED
ENCAMPMENT.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.459
WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER
LET THEM STAY.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.505
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS IS MY FAULT,

06:58.548 --> 07:00.811
AND I'M DEALING
WITH IT.

07:00.855 --> 07:03.466
WHAT ELSE AREN'T
YOU TELLING ME?

07:03.510 --> 07:06.991
WHY IS SANCTUM
ON LOCKDOWN?

07:07.035 --> 07:09.864
MIRANDA'S DEAD,

07:09.907 --> 07:12.867
KILLED BY
THE CHILD HOST,
CLARKE'S DAUGHTER.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.782
WE HAVE HER IN CUSTODY
WITH MOST OF THE OTHERS,

07:14.825 --> 07:16.044
BUT TWO OF THEM
ARE STILL AT LARGE.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.654
WE BELIEVE THEY'RE
IN SANCTUM,

07:17.698 --> 07:20.048
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE
ON LOCKDOWN.

07:20.091 --> 07:24.182
LOCKDOWN ISN'T ENOUGH
IF SOMEONE IS HIDING THEM.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.924
RUSSELL, THESE PEOPLE
KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT US.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.796
HOW LONG TILL IT SPREADS
TO OUR PEOPLE

07:28.839 --> 07:31.363
AND THEY COME
AFTER US?

07:31.407 --> 07:33.104
AN EXAMPLE
MUST BE MADE.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.932
IF YOU THINK I'M
EXECUTING A CHILD--

07:34.976 --> 07:37.152
NOT THE CHILD.
SHE HAS THE BLOOD.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.154
WE BURN THE REST,
WE FIND OUT WHO
WAS HELPING

07:39.197 --> 07:41.548
TO HIDE THE OTHER TWO,
AND THEY BURN WITH THEM.

07:41.591 --> 07:44.333
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

07:44.376 --> 07:47.554
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

07:47.597 --> 07:51.079
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
I FEEL IT, TOO,

07:51.122 --> 07:54.169
BUT IF WE DO THAT,
WE LEAVE NOTHING LEFT

07:54.212 --> 07:56.040
TO BARGAIN
FOR JOSEPHINE,

07:56.084 --> 08:00.958
AND WE WILL HAVE
BECOME JUST
LIKE THEM.

08:01.002 --> 08:04.658
LOOK AROUND YOU, MY LOVE.

08:04.701 --> 08:08.923
THE DREAM OF SANCTUM
IS ALREADY DEAD,

08:08.966 --> 08:13.144
BUT BECAUSE I TRUST YOU,
WE'LL ONLY KILL ONE.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.066
YOU'RE A LIAR.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.416
BELIEVE ME,
I WISH I WAS,

08:24.460 --> 08:27.419
BUT YOUR DAUGHTER'S
NOT ONE WITH
THE PRIMES.

08:27.463 --> 08:30.074
NO ONE IS.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.075
ERR!

08:34.122 --> 08:40.171
I SACRIFICED
MY BABY BOY...

08:40.215 --> 08:43.087
FOR NOTHING.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.133
MY WIFE COULDN'T
LIVE WITH THAT.

08:45.176 --> 08:48.353
SHE LAID DOWN
IN THE OFFERING GROVE
A YEAR LATER,

08:48.397 --> 08:51.400
AND I STILL BELIEVED.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.402
I BELIEVED.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.064
BLYTHE ANN: IT'S NOT A LIE.
JORDAN TRIED TO
TELL US THE TRUTH.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.805
OK. THE SHIP IS BACK,
THE FUSE IS LIT.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.763
NOW HOW DO WE GET
OUR PEOPLE OUT?

09:06.807 --> 09:08.330
RELAX. REVOLUTIONS
TAKE TIME.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.724
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THEIR REVOLUTION.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.334
WE NEED TO GET
OUR COMMANDER OUT OF HERE.

09:12.377 --> 09:16.512
SHE BANISHED YOU.
STILL, SHE'S ALL
YOU ARE ABOUT.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.515
LET'S HOPE THE NULL
GUARDS ARE MORE
EASILY SWAYED.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.170
-MEANING WHAT?
-MEANING IF THEY DON'T RISE UP

09:22.213 --> 09:24.215
AND OVERTHROW
THEIR FALSE GODS

09:24.259 --> 09:26.609
ONCE THEY LEARN
THE TRUTH,

09:26.653 --> 09:29.569
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A PLAN B.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.008
RYKER: EVERYBODY
GET IN POSITION.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.626
WHAT IS IT?

09:48.152 --> 09:50.024
ALL RIGHT. GO.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.638
GO DIRECTLY BACK
TO YOUR QUARTERS.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.162
IF YOU GET STOPPED,
YOU SHOW THEM
MY WORK ORDERS.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.642
WAIT. WHAT DO WE DO
WITH WHAT YOU TOLD US?

09:59.686 --> 10:02.210
NOTHING YET. ONCE
ENOUGH PEOPLE
KNOW THE TRUTH,

10:02.253 --> 10:05.256
WE CAN CHANGE THINGS
PEACEFULLY.

10:16.528 --> 10:17.921
ECHO: PEACEFULLY, HUH?

10:17.965 --> 10:19.575
KEEP TELLING YOURSELF
THAT, RYKER.

10:22.752 --> 10:25.189
GAIA: WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

10:25.233 --> 10:29.150
THEY'RE EXECUTING ONE
OF YOUR PEOPLE TONIGHT
FOR KILLING MIRANDA.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.804
-MADI?
-NO. WON'T BE HER.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.370
SHE'S A HOST.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.416
IF I KNOW SIMONE,
SHE'LL LET THEM CHOOSE

10:34.459 --> 10:36.940
WHO DIES THEMSELVES.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.246
HOW DO WE STOP IT?

10:38.289 --> 10:42.293
WE DON'T. I'LL NEED YOU
TO ADD A SCOPE TO MY BOW

10:42.337 --> 10:43.991
AND GET ME TO A WINDOW
WITH A VIEW

10:44.034 --> 10:45.775
OF THE EXECUTION.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.647
-PLAN B.
-WHOA. SLOW DOWN.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.910
YOU'RE NOT
ASSASSINATING ANYONE.

10:49.953 --> 10:52.564
I AGREED TO HIDE YOU,
I AGREED TO TELL
PEOPLE THE TRUTH.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.654
YOU DID THAT BECAUSE
I THREATENED TO EXPOSE YOU

10:54.697 --> 10:58.222
AS THE TRAITOR WHO LET
THE DEMON GABRIEL
GO FREE,

10:58.266 --> 11:01.269
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY
YOU'LL DO THIS.

11:10.452 --> 11:13.237
RYKER, ADMIT IT.

11:13.281 --> 11:16.110
IT FEELS GOOD TO BE
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

11:20.201 --> 11:24.248
IF YOU MISS, ONE
OF OUR PEOPLE DIES.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.294
I WON'T MISS.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.037
SO WHO WILL
THEY CHOOSE?

11:30.080 --> 11:33.910
WELL, THAT'S EASY.
MURPHY.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.651
IT'S GONNA BE ME,
ISN'T IT?

11:35.695 --> 11:38.741
IT SHOULD BE
YOU, TRAITOR!

11:38.785 --> 11:42.397
TOLD YOU.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.182
SAME LOOK SHE HAD
IN HER EYES WHEN
SHE STABBED JORDAN.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.054
MURPHY: CAN WE PLEASE
GET BACK TO THE FACT

11:47.097 --> 11:48.403
THAT ONE OF US
IS GONNA DIE TONIGHT?

11:48.446 --> 11:49.839
THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.493
ECHO WILL THINK
OF SOMETHING.

11:56.933 --> 12:00.545
WHY DID SHE CALL
YOU A TRAITOR?

12:00.589 --> 12:03.461
MADI: TELL HER,
TRAITOR.

12:03.505 --> 12:06.247
TELL HER HOW YOU
HELPED THE GIRL
WHO STOLE

12:06.290 --> 12:08.162
HER DAUGHTER'S BODY.

12:15.386 --> 12:18.738
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
ALREADY DEAD.

12:18.781 --> 12:22.480
EMORI: ABBY, HE MADE
A DEAL TO SAVE
ALL OF US.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.482
WHEN HE FOUND OUT
SHE WAS STILL ALIVE,

12:24.526 --> 12:27.007
HE DID THE RIGHT THING.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.356
EVENTUALLY.

12:36.494 --> 12:38.235
YOU BETTER HOPE
YOUR FRIEND ECHO
GETS US OUT OF HERE

12:38.279 --> 12:41.891
BECAUSE IF SHE
DOESN'T,

12:41.935 --> 12:43.501
WE CHOOSE YOU.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.467
JOSEPHINE: ♪ BEER ON THE WALL,
23 BOTTLES OF BEER ♪

12:52.510 --> 12:53.947
♪ TAKE ONE DOWN,
PASS IT AROUND ♪

12:53.990 --> 12:56.471
♪ 22 BOTTLES OF BEER

13:22.192 --> 13:25.065
JOSEPHINE?

13:27.502 --> 13:29.983
YOU DON'T WANT TO
SEE ME? SEE THIS.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.317
HEY.

14:00.361 --> 14:01.884
HEY!

14:01.928 --> 14:03.320
DOOR.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.368
WHY ARE YOUR MEMORIES
ON MY SIDE OF THE WALL?

14:07.411 --> 14:10.284
YOU KNOW WHY.
I TOLD YOU TO
GIVE ME CONTROL.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.286
NOW IT'S TOO LATE.

14:12.329 --> 14:13.809
HOW MUCH TIME
DO WE HAVE?

14:16.507 --> 14:18.118
NOT MUCH.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.597
FOLLOW ME.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.251
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

14:21.295 --> 14:23.123
I'M TAKING YOU BACK
TO YOUR SIDE.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.169
WHERE DO YOU THINK
I'M--

14:26.213 --> 14:28.345
JOSEPHINE: THERE ARE
NO MORE SIDES.

14:28.389 --> 14:31.305
NO, NO! GET AWAY
FROM ME!

14:31.348 --> 14:34.047
GET AWAY FROM ME!
JUST GET AWAY!

14:34.090 --> 14:35.439
GET A--GET AWAY
FROM ME!

14:35.483 --> 14:37.354
MY SECOND BODY.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.966
THE BARRIER BETWEEN
OUR MINDS IS
BREAKING DOWN.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.272
YOU DON'T SAY.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.666
LOOK. IF WE DON'T
THINK OF SOMETHING FAST,

14:44.709 --> 14:46.537
YOU DIE,
AND MY MIND DRIVE
IS LOST FOREVER,

14:46.581 --> 14:50.106
SO HOW ABOUT WE CUT
THE SARCASM AND--

14:50.150 --> 14:51.978
OR I COULD JUST
KILL YOU AGAIN.

14:52.021 --> 14:54.589
DON'T. WITHOUT
THE DOOR TO MY SIDE,

14:54.632 --> 14:57.809
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I'D GO
OR IF I'D COME BACK.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.463
IT COULD BE PERMANENT.

14:59.507 --> 15:02.945
AND THAT'S
A BAD THING WHY?

15:02.989 --> 15:05.078
FINE. PULL THE TRIGGER.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.949
WHAT IS IT YOU SAY?

15:06.993 --> 15:10.170
GO FLOAT YOURSELF.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.954
THAT'S IT.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.564
FOLLOW ME.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.484
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:20.528 --> 15:22.617
IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
THEN IN ORDER

15:22.660 --> 15:24.532
TO REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS,
WE NEED TO SEPARATE
OUR MINDS.

15:24.575 --> 15:27.622
CLARKE, THOSE ARE
MY MEMORIES.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.406
CLARKE!

15:29.450 --> 15:31.060
IT'S THIS
OR A BULLET.

15:31.104 --> 15:35.151
COMPUTER: WARNING. CATASTROPHIC
SYSTEMS FAILURE IN 15...

15:35.195 --> 15:36.500
DO IT.

15:36.544 --> 15:39.460
13, 12,, 11,

15:39.503 --> 15:44.856
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

15:44.900 --> 15:46.510
5...

15:54.388 --> 15:56.999
IT WORKED. COME ON.
HELP ME.

15:57.043 --> 16:02.831
WE HAVE TO DO MORE.
THEY'LL KEEP
BLEEDING THROUGH.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.312
JOSEPHINE.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.270
I DON'T--I DON'T
REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOOK.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.881
I JUST...

16:09.925 --> 16:12.101
I KNOW THAT
IT'S GONE.

16:12.145 --> 16:16.279
COMPUTER: WARNING.
SYSTEMS CRITICAL.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.020
LOOK. WE HAVE TO
DO THIS,

16:18.064 --> 16:19.979
OR OUR BRAIN DIES.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.764
FINE, BUT I CHOOSE
THE MEMORIES.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.818
YOU REALLY
MESSED UP.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.646
MURPHY: YEAH.
I'M AWARE.

16:41.696 --> 16:46.788
RAVEN: LOOK.
I KNOW YOU'RE
SCARED TO DIE.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.486
EVERYONE IS,

16:49.530 --> 16:52.054
BUT IF YOU WANT TO
AVOID HELL,

16:52.098 --> 16:55.927
THE ANSWER'S NOT
IMMORTALITY.

16:55.971 --> 16:58.713
IT'S MORALITY.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.758
HEH.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.412
MAN: OPEN UP.

17:04.762 --> 17:08.114
WAIT HERE.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.551
WOMAN: LET'S GO.
GAIA: LET GO OF ME.

17:10.594 --> 17:11.943
GAIA!

17:14.946 --> 17:16.513
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

17:20.561 --> 17:22.824
THOUGHT YOU WERE
BANISHED.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.739
SHE WAS!

17:24.782 --> 17:28.656
WE SHOULD HAVE
KILLED YOU WHEN WE
HAD THE CHANCE.

17:28.699 --> 17:32.834
DON'T WORRY, HEDA.
YOU'LL GET YOUR
CHANCE SOON

17:32.877 --> 17:36.664
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GETTING
OUT OF HERE TONIGHT.

17:36.707 --> 17:41.103
-ECHO?
-DURING THE EXECUTION.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.279
REST EASY, MURPHY.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.847
THE ONLY PERSON DYING
TONIGHT IS RUSSELL.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.596
RUSSELL: RYKER...

17:55.639 --> 17:57.598
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

18:00.383 --> 18:04.213
YEAH. UM, I WAS
JUST WONDERING

18:04.257 --> 18:06.476
WHEN WE STARTED
EXECUTING PEOPLE AGAIN.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.609
SIMONE: OH, SPARE US
YOUR EQUIVOCATION, RYKER.

18:08.652 --> 18:09.740
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

18:09.784 --> 18:11.655
YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT THAT MEANS.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.875
THE LIVES THAT WERE TAKEN
SO THAT YOU COULD BE HERE

18:13.918 --> 18:15.398
ENJOYING THIS MEAL.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.096
THEY DIDN'T DESERVE
TO DIE,

18:17.139 --> 18:18.749
AND YET NOW YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM EXECUTING
A CRIMINAL?

18:18.793 --> 18:21.535
CAN WE JUST EAT
LUNCH IN PEACE?

18:25.626 --> 18:28.585
PLEASE.

18:28.629 --> 18:31.893
PRIYA: WE ARE ALL
UPSET WITH WHAT'S
HAPPENED, SIMONE.

18:31.936 --> 18:34.156
HOPEFULLY NEXT TIME,
THE TWO OF YOU
WILL INVOLVE US

18:34.200 --> 18:37.246
IN YOUR DECISIONS
BEFORE THEY SPIRAL
OUT OF CONTROL.

18:38.682 --> 18:41.642
APOLOGIES,
BUT I HAVE NEWS.

18:41.685 --> 18:44.775
THE ONE THEY CALL GAIA
HAS BEEN CAPTURED.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.777
WE PUT HER IN
WITH THE OTHERS.

18:46.821 --> 18:48.562
RUSSELL: WELL DONE.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.346
AND WHAT HAVE
WE HERE?

18:50.390 --> 18:53.610
SIR, HIS NAME IS TAI,
A NULL WHO CLAIMS

18:53.654 --> 18:58.180
TO KNOW WHERE THE LAST
OF THEM--ECHO--
IS HIDING.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.573
SO WHY BRING
HIM HERE?

18:59.616 --> 19:00.922
HE'S AFRAID TO TALK, SIR.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.837
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE
MORE INCLINED

19:02.880 --> 19:04.534
TO DO SO
WITH YOUR EMINENCE.

19:04.578 --> 19:05.927
A GOOD THOUGHT.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.017
BRING HIM IN.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.324
HELLO, TAI.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.630
COME. SIT.
TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW.

19:13.674 --> 19:14.936
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

19:17.373 --> 19:22.204
NO, THANK YOU.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.728
I SHOULD MAKE THIS
QUICK.

19:24.772 --> 19:27.296
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
TO TALK TO ONE
OF US ALONE.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.430
WHAT I KNOW...

19:30.473 --> 19:33.607
WHAT I THOUGHT
I KNEW

19:33.650 --> 19:36.175
WHEN I SACRIFICED
MY CHILD

19:36.218 --> 19:41.310
IN THE OFFERING GROVE
BY YOUR CHILD'S COMMAND

19:41.354 --> 19:45.619
WAS THAT YOU WERE
ALL GODS...

19:45.662 --> 19:47.751
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.666
IT'S ALL A LIE,
AND IF THERE'S

19:49.710 --> 19:51.886
ANY JUSTICE LEFT
IN THIS WORLD,

19:51.929 --> 19:54.236
YOUR CHILD WILL DIE
IN THOSE SAME WOODS.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.020
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

19:57.544 --> 19:58.762
RUSSELL: NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO. SIMONE.

19:58.806 --> 20:00.199
I SAID, "DEATH TO PRIMES!"

20:00.242 --> 20:01.635
RUSSELL: SIMONE!
GET A DOCTOR!

20:01.678 --> 20:03.071
DEATH TO PRIMES!

20:03.114 --> 20:04.855
RUSSELL:
GET A DOCTOR NOW!

20:04.899 --> 20:07.031
TAI: DEATH TO PRIMES!
DEATH TO PRIMES!

20:07.075 --> 20:08.859
DEATH TO PRIMES!

20:10.513 --> 20:13.690
I'LL BRING YOU BACK.

20:13.734 --> 20:16.389
WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO,

20:16.432 --> 20:20.219
I'LL BRING YOU BACK.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.046

27:18.985 --> 27:21.683
TAKE HER.

27:21.727 --> 27:25.861
COME ON.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.646
HEY, HEY. LET'S GO.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.691
WAIT. NO. I CAN'T
FEEL MY LEGS.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.606
YEAH. WE HAVE TO
HURRY. COME ON.

27:31.650 --> 27:35.871
BELLAMY: RIGHT
BEHIND YOU.

27:35.915 --> 27:37.481
GO BACK TO SANCTUM.

27:37.525 --> 27:41.398
YOU TELL RUSSELL IF HE
HURTS ANY OF MY PEOPLE

27:41.442 --> 27:47.230
HE'LL NEVER SEE
HIS DAUGHTER AGAIN.

27:47.274 --> 27:48.623
GO!

27:56.587 --> 27:58.241
BELL--

28:15.215 --> 28:17.217
I WON'T LET YOU TAKE
THIS CHILD.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.132
GET THE HELL OUT
OF MY SIGHT BEFORE I WRAP

28:19.175 --> 28:23.527
THIS CHAIN AROUND
YOUR THROAT FOR
DISOBEYING ME!

28:23.571 --> 28:25.181
ABBY: OH, FOR GOD SAKES,

28:25.225 --> 28:27.270
JUST TAKE THE DAMN FLAME
OUT OF HER HEAD.

28:27.314 --> 28:30.273
I CAN'T. SHE CHANGED
THE PASSPHRASE.

28:38.238 --> 28:41.937
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN WE GET BACK
TO THE MOTHERSHIP

28:41.981 --> 28:44.331
AND SHE WAKES
HER SLEEPING ARMY?

28:49.771 --> 28:53.166
WE CAN'T LET HER
LEAD THEM.

28:53.209 --> 28:56.082
H-HOW WAS SHEIDHEDA
STOPPED IN HIS TIME?

28:56.125 --> 28:59.825
EMORI: KILLED BY HIS
FLAMEKEEPER,

28:59.868 --> 29:01.217
OR SO THE STORY GOES.

29:01.261 --> 29:04.307
GAIA: HIS FOURTH
FLAMEKEEPER ACTUALLY.

29:04.351 --> 29:08.224
HE MURDERED
THE FIRST 3.

29:08.268 --> 29:11.010
HOLD ON. IF YOU THINK
FOR ONE SECOND

29:11.053 --> 29:12.968
I AM GONNA LET YOU
KILL THAT CHILD--

29:13.012 --> 29:14.317
WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME DO?

29:14.361 --> 29:17.320
IF WE LET THAT THING
COMMAND ONE WONKRU,

29:17.364 --> 29:21.455
HE'LL MAKE US LONG
FOR THE DAYS
OF BLODREINA.

29:21.498 --> 29:24.197
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE OTHER COMMANDERS
IN THE FLAME?

29:27.809 --> 29:31.291
TELL THAT ONE
NOTHING.

29:31.334 --> 29:34.207
THEY'RE STILL
IN THERE, AREN'T THEY?

29:37.819 --> 29:40.169
HE ISOLATED THEM
SOMEHOW,

29:40.213 --> 29:43.346
MANIPULATING THE A.I.
TO DO IT.

29:43.390 --> 29:45.392
IF THE CODE FROM THE MINDS
OF THE COMMANDERS

29:45.435 --> 29:47.524
CAN BE ISOLATED,

29:47.568 --> 29:50.049
IT CAN BE DELETED.

29:50.092 --> 29:52.442
WHERE'S BECCA'S
NOTEBOOK?

29:52.486 --> 29:54.705
BACK IN THE MACHINE SHOP,
BUT--

29:56.838 --> 29:58.274
MAN: OPEN IT UP.

30:02.191 --> 30:05.194
MORALITY NOT
IMMORTALITY, HUH?

30:08.545 --> 30:10.286
MAN: TIME'S UP.
LET'S MOVE.

30:10.330 --> 30:14.247
MURPHY: WELL,
LOOKS LIKE I'M
THE LUCKY WINNER.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.294
CHANGE OF PLANS.

30:18.338 --> 30:20.819
RUSSELL LIGHTBOURNE VII,
SAVIOR OF SANCTUM,

30:20.862 --> 30:23.343
HAS ISSUED
A NEW ORDER.

30:23.386 --> 30:26.563
THE CHILD IS SPARED,

30:26.607 --> 30:29.131
BUT THE REST OF YOU
WILL BURN AT THE STAKE

30:29.175 --> 30:30.916
FOR YOUR CRIMES.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.526
WHAT?

30:32.569 --> 30:34.049
LET'S GO.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.398
COME ON.
THIS WASN'T THE PLAN.

30:35.442 --> 30:38.532
-GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.
-LET GO. STOP!

30:38.575 --> 30:40.316
GOOD-BYE, SEDA.

30:49.499 --> 30:52.546
RUSSELL: I CAME TO THIS WORLD
WITH A DREAM.

30:52.589 --> 30:56.550
FROM THAT DREAM,
WE CREATED SANCTUM

30:56.593 --> 30:59.727
AND GAVE LIFE
TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.

30:59.770 --> 31:03.426
SIMONE AND I HAVE LOVED
YOU AS WE LOVED YOUR PARENTS

31:03.470 --> 31:04.906
AND THEIR PARENTS
BEFORE THEM.

31:04.950 --> 31:09.258
YOU ARE OUR CHILDREN,

31:09.302 --> 31:13.523
AND FOR 200 YEARS,
WE TAUGHT YOU NOT TO FIGHT,

31:13.567 --> 31:16.439
WE TAUGHT YOU TO FORGIVE,

31:16.483 --> 31:19.225
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS
FOR WHICH THERE CAN BE

31:19.268 --> 31:20.791
NO FORGIVENESS.

31:20.835 --> 31:23.446
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
ME IT WOULD BE
ALL OF THEM?

31:23.490 --> 31:24.926
I DIDN'T KNOW.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.319
RUSSELL: JOSEPHINE
IS MISSING,

31:26.362 --> 31:28.103
TAKEN BY THEM
BEYOND THE SHIELD,

31:28.147 --> 31:31.541
AND MUST NOW BE
PRESUMED TO BE DEAD.

31:31.585 --> 31:34.327
I PRAY TO ALL THAT IS HOLY
THAT SHE WILL SOMEDAY RETURN.

31:34.370 --> 31:36.024
DAMN IT.
STOP MOVING.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.939
HE'S LYING!

31:39.288 --> 31:40.768
EMORI: THEY'RE NOT GODS!
GUARD: SHUT UP!

31:40.811 --> 31:42.291
HEY!

31:42.335 --> 31:44.554
RUSSELL: NOW THE DISEASE
THAT THESE BLASPHEMERS

31:44.598 --> 31:48.645
BROUGHT WITH THEM
FROM EARTH HAS SPREAD.

31:48.689 --> 31:53.824
TODAY, MY BELOVED SIMONE
HAS BEEN MURDERED, TOO,

31:53.868 --> 31:57.393
BY ONE OF OUR OWN.

31:57.437 --> 32:00.701
OUR SANCTUM FAMILY
HAS BEEN VIOLATED.

32:00.744 --> 32:03.051
WE MUST DEFEND IT.

32:03.095 --> 32:04.966
YOU MUST DEFEND IT.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.402
ECHO: GOT HIM.

32:08.056 --> 32:10.624
I'M SORRY.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.452
UNH!

32:14.106 --> 32:15.716
FOR MY FAMILY.

32:19.067 --> 32:21.069
RUSSELL: WHAT WE DO NOW

32:21.113 --> 32:24.507
WE DO FOR THE DREAM
THAT WAS...

32:24.551 --> 32:27.380
AND WILL AGAIN
BE SANCTUM.

32:40.697 --> 32:44.310
RUSSELL, YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO THIS, PLEASE.

32:44.353 --> 32:45.789
RUSSELL!

32:47.443 --> 32:49.315
RUSSELL: TO THINK YOUR BONES
MIGHT HAVE WOUND UP

32:49.358 --> 32:51.534
IN THE RELIQUARY.

32:51.578 --> 32:54.146
BONES.

32:54.189 --> 32:55.364
WAIT, WAIT.
LISTEN, LISTEN.

32:55.408 --> 32:57.149
WE CAN STILL MAKE
NIGHTBLOOD.

32:57.192 --> 32:58.585
RUSSELL, LISTEN
TO ME, OK?

32:58.628 --> 33:00.543
YOU CAN STILL SAVE
YOUR WIFE!

33:04.634 --> 33:08.421
BONE MARROW.

33:08.464 --> 33:10.249
RAVEN: HE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH.

33:10.292 --> 33:13.469
ABBY CAN DO IT JUST LIKE
SHE DID IT FOR CLARKE.

33:13.513 --> 33:18.213
WE TRIED BONE MARROW
TRANSPLANTATION 100 YEARS AGO.

33:18.257 --> 33:21.216
IT FAILED.

33:23.305 --> 33:27.222
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU
DON'T KNOW THE FORMULA,

33:27.266 --> 33:30.617
AND IF YOU KILL US,
YOU NEVER WILL.

33:41.410 --> 33:42.716
TAKE THEM DOWN.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.935
GUARD: YES, SIR.
TAKE THEM DOWN.

33:56.643 --> 33:58.819
I NEED
A NIGHTBLOOD DONOR.

33:58.862 --> 34:02.127
YOU'LL DO JUST FINE.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.042
RUSSELL: MOVE THE CHILD HOST
TO MY LAB.

34:04.085 --> 34:07.741
RAVEN: ABBY, IT'S OK.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.786
WE'LL GET YOU A LIST
OF MATERIALS,

34:09.830 --> 34:13.355
BUT WE NEED ACCESS
TO THE COMPUTER.

34:13.399 --> 34:15.531
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS,

34:15.575 --> 34:17.577
OR WE'RE
RIGHT BACK HERE.

34:22.582 --> 34:25.933
YOU WANT TO SAVE MADI,
GET ME BECCA'S NOTEBOOK.

34:28.718 --> 34:30.024
WAIT.

34:43.429 --> 34:47.389
THROUGH FIRE,
WE PURIFY SANCTUM.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.132
UGH!

34:52.786 --> 34:56.485
NO! AGH! AAH!

35:34.828 --> 35:37.831
TWO WAVELENGTHS,
ONE BRAIN.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.579
YOU MIND TELLING ME HOW
CLARKE'S CONSCIOUSNESS
SURVIVED?

35:46.622 --> 35:49.147
THERE'S A NEURAL MESH
IN HER HEAD.

35:49.190 --> 35:54.021
HER MIND LATCHED ONTO IT
DURING THE PROCEDURE.

35:54.064 --> 35:55.849
IT'S PRETTY COOL, HUH?

36:00.245 --> 36:01.681
WHAT CAN WE DO?

36:01.724 --> 36:03.335
ONCE I REMOVE
HER DRIVE,

36:03.378 --> 36:04.684
I'LL NEED YOU TO QUICKLY
BANDAGE THE WOUND

36:04.727 --> 36:06.729
BEFORE I RESTART
HER HEART.

36:06.773 --> 36:08.949
YOU'RE STOPPING
HER HEART?

36:08.992 --> 36:11.691
GABRIEL: DEATH CAUSES
HER MIND TO BACK UP
ONTO THE DRIVE.

36:11.734 --> 36:14.476
I TAKE IT OUT,
START HER HEART.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.697
WE GET CLARKE BACK?

36:17.740 --> 36:21.353
SHE WAS RIGHT
TO DEPEND ON YOU.

36:21.396 --> 36:25.661
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
WE'RE ACTUALLY FRIENDS.

36:25.705 --> 36:28.925
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT
IF YOU EVER MEET
IN THE REAL WORLD.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.492
HEH.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.451
REAL WORLD?

36:32.494 --> 36:38.196
BELLAMY: YEAH. AFTER
I USE HER MIND DRIVE
TO BARGAIN FOR PEACE.

36:38.239 --> 36:41.547
WHAT'S WRONG?

36:41.590 --> 36:43.679
HE KNOWS THAT MEANS

36:43.723 --> 36:46.073
I'LL BE RESURRECTED AGAIN,

36:46.116 --> 36:48.597
AND HE'S NOT SURE
IF HE CAN LET THEM TAKE

36:48.641 --> 36:50.512
ANOTHER INNOCENT LIFE.

36:56.823 --> 37:00.479
AYE, THERE'S THE RUB.

37:02.481 --> 37:07.268
FOR IN THAT SLEEP
OF DEATH,

37:07.312 --> 37:09.183
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME?

37:12.926 --> 37:18.801
BUT I GUESS WHAT WAS
OK FOR YOU, HUH, OLD MAN?

37:18.845 --> 37:22.675
NO. IT WASN'T.

37:22.718 --> 37:26.418
YOU KNOW THAT
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.376
IF YOU LET ME KEEP
THIS BODY,

37:28.420 --> 37:30.160
NOBODY ELSE HAS TO DIE.

37:30.204 --> 37:32.598
OK. NO MORE TALKING.
DO IT.

37:32.641 --> 37:34.774
I KNOW THAT I'VE
DONE BAD THINGS.

37:34.817 --> 37:37.429
I DON'T REMEMBER
THEM ALL,

37:37.472 --> 37:41.607
BUT I DO KNOW THAT
YOU HATE ME FOR IT.

37:41.650 --> 37:44.871
I COULD NEVER
HATE YOU.

37:44.914 --> 37:46.176
I KNOW IT.

37:48.918 --> 37:52.705
WE CAN STILL BE
TOGETHER, MY LOVE.

37:52.748 --> 37:54.750
WE CAN TAKE OUT
HE DRIVES

37:54.794 --> 37:57.231
JUST LIKE YOU WANTED.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.712
WE CAN GROW
OLD TOGETHER.

38:03.455 --> 38:07.459
I...I'VE LOVED YOU
FOR CENTURIES.

38:07.502 --> 38:08.721
HEH.

38:13.508 --> 38:18.383
WE HAD OUR TIME.

38:18.426 --> 38:19.906
I HAVE TO LET YOU
GO NOW.

39:03.471 --> 39:05.952
ALL RIGHT.
COVER THE WOUND.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.041
WE NEED TO RESTART
HER HEART.

39:21.054 --> 39:24.884
WHY ISN'T SHE
WAKING UP?

39:24.927 --> 39:29.062
WAIT. WHY AM I
STILL HERE?

39:29.105 --> 39:32.065
JOSEPHINE: BECAUSE
I'M STILL HERE.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.458
UNH!

39:35.764 --> 39:38.027
SANCTUM IS MINE.

39:38.071 --> 39:39.899
I USED THE SURGICAL MESH.

39:39.942 --> 39:43.206
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE WHOLE
WORKING TOGETHER THING,

39:43.250 --> 39:44.904
BUT I KNOW YOU, CLARKE.

39:44.947 --> 39:48.342
IF YOU CAME BACK,
YOU'D KILL EVERYONE
INSIDE SANCTUM.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.170
IT'S WHAT YOU DO.

39:50.213 --> 39:51.998
GABRIEL: I'M SORRY,

39:52.041 --> 39:54.609
BUT HER BRAIN CAN
NO LONGER SUPPORT
TWO MINDS.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.873
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
DO SOMETHING.

39:57.917 --> 39:59.397
THEY'RE BOTH STILL
IN THERE.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.529
LATENT NEURAL ACTIVITY
CONTINUES FOR A SHORT TIME

40:01.573 --> 40:03.575
AFTER DEATH,
BUT ONCE THE HEAD STOPS

40:03.618 --> 40:09.450
TELLING THE HEART TO BEAT,
IT'S OVER, OK?

40:09.494 --> 40:11.278
THE HEART AND THE HEAD.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.019
THE HEART
AND THE HEAD.

40:24.073 --> 40:25.597
-BELL.
-NO.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.642
I'M NOT LOSING HER AGAIN.

40:27.686 --> 40:30.384
COME ON, CLARKE.
COME ON!

40:40.394 --> 40:43.092
CLARKE, CLARKE,
I NEED YOU.

40:43.136 --> 40:46.052
MADI NEEDS YOU.

40:46.095 --> 40:48.489
NOW WAKE UP!

40:48.533 --> 40:52.580
BELLAMY...
SHE'S GONE.

40:52.624 --> 40:55.061
NO, SHE'S NOT!

40:55.104 --> 40:57.063
WAKE UP, CLARKE!
COME ON!

40:57.106 --> 40:59.979
GAH! I'M NOT
LETTING YOU GO.

41:00.022 --> 41:04.157
YOU'RE A FIGHTER.
NOW GET UP AND FIGHT!

41:04.200 --> 41:05.637
UNH!

41:05.680 --> 41:08.770
BELLAMY: GET UP
AND FIGHT! UNH!

41:16.648 --> 41:19.041
BELLAMY: YOU'RE OK.
JUST BREATHE.

41:21.087 --> 41:23.176
YOU'RE OK.
JUST BREATHE.

41:23.219 --> 41:24.525
JUST BREATHE.

41:27.354 --> 41:29.443
CLARKE?

41:49.768 --> 41:51.987
THE HEAD AND THE HEART.
