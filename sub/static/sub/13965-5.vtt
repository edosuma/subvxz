21:42.260 --> 21:44.251
Ha! I mean, I made it all.

21:45.096 --> 21:46.506
I was a carpenter once.

21:48.433 --> 21:51.925
Met Adaline when my family
built her family's
summer home.

21:52.395 --> 21:55.262
No offense, but I didn't think
the Qreshi princesses
married down.

21:55.356 --> 21:58.814
Her family
threatened to disown her
when they found out,

21:58.902 --> 22:01.769
but she won that fight,
like she always does.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.858
And when she decided
to kick Pawter out,
you just what?

22:06.201 --> 22:07.361
Let her win that, too?

22:09.621 --> 22:11.407
When you love
two people equally,

22:12.415 --> 22:13.700
you have to make a choice.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.496
You choose the one
that makes you a better man.

22:18.421 --> 22:19.831
Better?

22:19.923 --> 22:22.130
Because where I'm from,
only assholes
kick their kids out,

22:22.217 --> 22:24.003
and I say that as
a son of an asshole.

22:24.260 --> 22:27.172
You have no idea
what this family
has had to do.

22:27.263 --> 22:29.128
Or what was best
for my daughter.

An Alpha Shield?

22:41.110 --> 22:42.270
You have an Alpha Shield?
Yeah.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.269
What's an Alpha Shield?
What's a...

22:44.989 --> 22:46.854
It's a high-resonance
energy barrier

22:46.950 --> 22:48.690
permeable only by
light and oxygen.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.366
It's the ultimate
containment device.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.906
When you have as many enemies
as my wife does...

22:52.997 --> 22:56.740
No,no,no.
It doesn't keep enemies out.
It keeps things in.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.416
Like, say,
a pathogen from the lab.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.212
I got to get
this shield down now.

23:29.534 --> 23:30.614
It's confusing.

23:30.702 --> 23:31.908
D'avin can take care
of himself.

23:31.995 --> 23:33.326
Not against the Black Root.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.745
If they catch up to him first,
we'll both be dead.

23:36.624 --> 23:39.661
If I didn't know better,
I'd think these Black
Root people scare you.

23:39.836 --> 23:41.326
Actually, they report to me.

I'm not gonna
let D'av's body die

don't care about him.

I care about him very much.

Someone stole my work
to use against my family.

but the Alpha Shield
will keep it in.

Oh. So your fog
can kill us all
in the process?

25:04.253 --> 25:05.754
I have a plan.
I have one, too.

25:06.547 --> 25:09.334
It involves blowing the shit
out of your shield’s
power source.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.416
No power, no shield,
and we all get out of here.

25:11.886 --> 25:13.751
If the pathogen escapes...
No, I have done the math.

We are 186 miles from
the closest land mass.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.297

will disperse it.

with your sister.

Why did I have to?

25:35.118 --> 25:36.358
Why are you doing this?

25:36.452 --> 25:38.943

my attempt to stop it.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.644
Johnny, you can't.

31:43.861 --> 31:46.068
If it means that
you all live, yes, I can.

31:46.155 --> 31:48.771
No, ifwe can't
protect you from the fog,
I won't let you.

31:48.866 --> 31:49.901
My diving suit...

31:49.992 --> 31:51.198
Look,
if I can do this fast enough,

31:51.285 --> 31:52.616
then I can get off planet,
and we can get treated.

31:52.703 --> 31:54.785
You saw how fast it moves,
and there is no antidote.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.411
Hello? Diving suit?

31:56.791 --> 31:58.531
For God's sake,
Louella, this is serious!

31:58.626 --> 31:59.661
So am I!

32:00.002 --> 32:01.333
You need to protect yourself

32:02.171 --> 32:04.002
with something non-porous

32:04.090 --> 32:05.830
that can cover
your entire body

32:05.925 --> 32:07.665
and can
withstand extreme cold.

32:08.344 --> 32:10.050
Something like
the diving suit.

32:19.939 --> 32:21.804
MALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Air purity, 90%.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.269
(GRUNTS)

32:31.992 --> 32:33.277
You just couldn't
stay out of things

32:33.369 --> 32:35.030
that don't
concern you, huh, big guy?

32:41.877 --> 32:44.163
So blow this thing,

32:44.255 --> 32:45.870
set off a big chain reaction,

32:46.006 --> 32:47.542
burn the fog
right out of the air, huh?

32:47.675 --> 32:49.165
Yeah, something like that.

32:50.386 --> 32:51.375
(SHATTERING)

32:53.055 --> 32:56.388
We let the fog
finish out the fam inside,
then we bolt,

32:56.475 --> 32:58.636
and then
we split the Joy 50-50.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.558
And Iwon't have to
explain a dead Killjoy

33:00.646 --> 33:03.183
along with the Simms family
popsicles inside.

33:03.274 --> 33:06.732
(LAUGHING) You really are
a massive dickhole,
you know that?

33:06.819 --> 33:08.355
Careful,
you might hurt my feelings.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.773
So what's it gonna be?

33:12.241 --> 33:14.277
She was giving me orders
till the very end.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.200
Never even said, "I love you."

33:18.164 --> 33:19.370
LOUELLA: I don't know.

33:19.540 --> 33:22.532
I think giving orders
was Mommy's way of saying,
"I love you."

33:24.044 --> 33:25.420
WEYMER:
He should be back by now.

33:28.007 --> 33:29.087
I'm going out there.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.087
What? Daddy,
no, the fog!
Johnny will do it.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.169
If something is wrong,
we all die.

33:34.263 --> 33:35.343
Then let me go!
No.

33:35.431 --> 33:37.262
Daddy, please stay.
No.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.764
No, you both need to stay.

33:40.436 --> 33:41.642
You are the family now.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.931
No, Dad, Ican't.
Please don't go.
Yes, you can.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.062
Sometimes we have choices,

33:46.442 --> 33:47.773
and sometimes we don't.

33:50.112 --> 33:51.613
Just hope this works.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.985
Well, if it doesn't,
Jaqobis will be
too dead to complain about it.

33:58.412 --> 33:59.913
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
(GASPING)

34:00.623 --> 34:04.707
Fine, Killjoy dies
in a freak gas accident
works, too.

34:05.419 --> 34:07.831
You know, I never liked you.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.706
Will you people just die?

34:12.801 --> 34:13.790
(BOTH GRUNTING)

34:14.887 --> 34:15.876
(BOTH GRUNT)

34:17.139 --> 34:18.845

34:22.102 --> 34:23.967
Your bomb,
will it still work?

34:26.649 --> 34:27.684
JOHN: Not remotely.

34:27.775 --> 34:30.608
The only way to blow it up now
would be to shoot it,
but then...

34:30.694 --> 34:32.559
Whoever does that
will blow up, too.

34:32.655 --> 34:33.610
Yeah.

34:33.697 --> 34:36.484
The fog is almost
in the house. Go.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.319
Mr. Simms...

34:38.410 --> 34:39.525
I'm dead already.

34:39.954 --> 34:42.411
It only means something
if someone survives.

34:43.457 --> 34:45.573
Just”

34:45.751 --> 34:47.161
Take care of my daughter.

34:47.628 --> 34:49.334
She can take pretty
good care of herself, sir.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.001
WEYMER:
I'll give you two minutes.

35:02.184 --> 35:03.219
D'av?

35:04.103 --> 35:05.263
(FAINTLY) No.

35:05.354 --> 35:06.764
LUCY: D’avin’s vital
signs are critical.

35:06.855 --> 35:07.935
I'm aware, Lucy.

35:08.524 --> 35:09.889
We'll keep going
until itworks.

35:10.317 --> 35:11.397
Any last words?

35:11.902 --> 35:13.062
Now's your chance.

35:15.531 --> 35:16.611
I did Change.

35:17.074 --> 35:18.109
How?

35:18.867 --> 35:20.198
I don't hate you anymore.

35:21.537 --> 35:22.652
I miss it.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.032
Hating you is simple.

35:26.709 --> 35:30.543
And, now, I'm floating,
and I don't know
what to hold onto.

35:31.839 --> 35:32.828
(SIGHS)

35:33.215 --> 35:34.204
(CHUCKUNG)

35:34.341 --> 35:35.581
This is funny to you?

35:37.177 --> 35:39.042
D'AVIN: (AS KHLYEN)
Look. It was there all along.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.922
Lucy, show me
D'avin's neural readout.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.099
Who operated on
Jaqobis' brain?

35:46.312 --> 35:48.303
The army.
What does that change?

35:48.397 --> 35:49.386
Hopefully, everything.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.442
I sent one last transmission
from Red 17.

35:56.071 --> 35:57.481
I know.

35:57.573 --> 35:58.904
We haven't been
able to crack it.

35:59.366 --> 36:00.481
When you do,

36:01.577 --> 36:02.783
you'll have your answers.

36:03.579 --> 36:04.785
Just tell me one last thing.

36:05.748 --> 36:07.784
Why was I on Arkyn as a girl?

36:10.169 --> 36:11.329
It wasn't you.

36:12.129 --> 36:13.118
(ZAPPING)

36:32.316 --> 36:33.305

D'av.

37:03.555 --> 37:04.965
(GROANING)

37:10.145 --> 37:12.227
Why do my teeth ache?

37:13.732 --> 37:15.347
And why am I bleeding?

37:15.442 --> 37:16.978
Because I'm a shit surgeon.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.567
Long story.

37:19.655 --> 37:21.111
Where the hells were you?

37:22.449 --> 37:23.655
Seeing family.

37:27.329 --> 37:28.830
DUTCH: Now let's go
get Johnny.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.489
(GASPS)

37:34.962 --> 37:36.042
Are we safe?

37:36.130 --> 37:37.836
Are you, you?

37:43.679 --> 37:44.964
Give me the stick.

37:49.226 --> 37:51.467
Nice to have you back, sir.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.765
Jaqobis was part of
a military experiment.

37:54.857 --> 37:56.893
It seems they took liberties
we were not aware of.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.400
We're going to find out
what and replicate it.

38:01.071 --> 38:04.154
So are we going to
see Jaqobis again?

38:05.325 --> 38:06.610
I certainly hope so.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.534
Well, me, too.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.163
There is no land
but the family.

38:17.254 --> 38:19.620
There is no water but
the law of The Nine.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.172
There is no life but Qresh.

38:22.259 --> 38:23.715
This I swear

38:24.219 --> 38:26.050
as Illenore Seyah Simms,

38:26.138 --> 38:28.129
lady of the land,

38:28.223 --> 38:29.759
now and forever.

38:29.892 --> 38:30.881
(BELL RINGS)

38:38.901 --> 38:40.016
You came.

38:40.486 --> 38:43.444
I had this other
coronation to go to,
but screw that guy.

38:44.907 --> 38:46.067
How's Old Town?

38:46.992 --> 38:48.573
Still behind the big ass wall.

38:50.621 --> 38:53.237
I'm gonna have to go up
against a lot of people
to bring it down.

38:54.124 --> 38:56.456
Well, like I said,
lam an excellent wingman.

38:58.337 --> 39:00.328
Johnny, I don't want you
to do this for me.

39:01.507 --> 39:02.667
I'm not that guy.

39:06.094 --> 39:10.007
Okay, I'm
definitely being that guy,
but that's not what this is.

39:12.184 --> 39:13.720
What about
"The Warrant is all"?

39:14.978 --> 39:16.229
That's Killjoy Johnny.

39:17.064 --> 39:19.100
Qreshi Fireball Johnny
wants something different.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.141
What?

39:26.782 --> 39:27.897
To give a shit.

39:29.159 --> 39:30.274
Like you do.

39:31.453 --> 39:33.318
I'm tired of not
being able to do that,

39:35.791 --> 39:37.281
and Iwant to
give a shit together.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.330
You know, maybe...

39:44.174 --> 39:46.631
The Warrant isn't all for me.

39:47.803 --> 39:49.668
Johnny, you couldn't
tell Dutch anything.

39:51.390 --> 39:53.301
Or D'av, for their sake
as much as ours.

39:57.771 --> 39:59.352
What are you thinking?

40:01.608 --> 40:03.473
Just something
your dad said to me
about choices.

40:23.422 --> 40:25.629
So what was it like
to be Khlyen?

40:27.009 --> 40:28.590
Sleek.

40:28.802 --> 40:29.791
Oh.

40:30.721 --> 40:31.881
And Dad?

40:34.224 --> 40:35.384
How's he?

40:38.061 --> 40:39.676
He just seemed so small.

40:41.648 --> 40:44.606
All right, Skeevers are done.
New Level 2 warrants in.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.694
Hokkleggers in the Badlands.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.895

keep whatever booze
they don't blow up.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.197
The glamours
of killjoying.

40:53.577 --> 40:54.737
I'll go gear up.

40:58.332 --> 41:01.369
You know, we never really did
talk about everything that,
uh...

41:01.627 --> 41:02.662
It's fine.

41:02.753 --> 41:04.459
I'm just glad you're fine.

41:07.716 --> 41:08.876
You, too.

41:14.723 --> 41:15.712
(LAUGHING)

41:16.516 --> 41:17.551

41:18.352 --> 41:19.967
If you want to walk
away without making
eye contact,

41:20.062 --> 41:21.723
that's cool with me.
(CHUCKLES)

41:23.440 --> 41:24.600
A lot of things

41:25.734 --> 41:27.224
have changed for me lately.

41:29.446 --> 41:30.811
Just glad we haven't.

41:32.949 --> 41:34.735
You're my gravity,
Johnny Jaqobis.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.745
But if things did change,
you'd tell me, right?

41:47.130 --> 41:48.631
Of course I would.

41:51.593 --> 41:52.799
Okay, then.

41:55.097 --> 41:57.008
