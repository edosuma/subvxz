00:01.672 --> 00:04.011
Previously on "Desperate
Housewives"... Why on earth

00:04.035 --> 00:05.982
would you let them finger paint
before breakfast?

00:06.006 --> 00:08.154
It's my job to clean that up,
so it's my call.

00:08.179 --> 00:10.057
Some households reversed roles.

00:10.081 --> 00:11.458
Let's give this another shot.

00:11.482 --> 00:13.020
Some old flames...

00:13.044 --> 00:14.121
You want me back?

00:14.145 --> 00:15.122
Yeah.

00:15.146 --> 00:16.093
Were put out.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.464
It has to be something
you're ingesting.

00:17.488 --> 00:20.067
Who prepares your meals?

00:20.091 --> 00:22.469
I understand you've been having
some marital problems.

00:22.493 --> 00:25.132
And while some learn
to forgive...

00:25.156 --> 00:27.704
Deirdre got pregnant
before I went to jail.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.177
Zach is your son, isn't he?

00:30.201 --> 00:31.278
Yep.

00:31.302 --> 00:32.409
Wow.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.490
Others could not
bring themselves

00:34.514 --> 00:37.165
to forget their past.

00:44.575 --> 00:47.354
The remarkable thing
about Danny Farrell

00:47.378 --> 00:51.498
was that he had only been
a paperboy for six months,

00:51.522 --> 00:54.361
and in that time,
he had become the enemy

00:54.385 --> 00:56.703
of every woman on Wisteria Lane.

00:56.727 --> 01:01.037
If there was a puddle
on someone's property...

01:01.061 --> 01:03.740
He found it.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.251
If a new rosebush
had just been planted...

01:06.275 --> 01:11.178
He destroyed it.

01:11.202 --> 01:16.253
If a cat was enjoying
a moment in the sun...

01:16.277 --> 01:19.426
He ended it.

01:19.450 --> 01:24.831
People wondered
if Danny would ever change.

01:24.855 --> 01:28.135
They should have
talked to Susan Mayer.

01:28.159 --> 01:31.598
She could have told them...

01:31.622 --> 01:36.603
Obnoxious boys
tend to become obnoxious men,

01:36.627 --> 01:40.307
just like the one...

01:40.331 --> 01:43.201
She had been married to.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.183
Hey!

01:46.207 --> 01:50.687
Carl, I see you.
Just stop right there.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.159
Hey, susie q.

01:52.183 --> 01:54.161
What are you doing?

01:54.185 --> 01:56.193
I'm just gettin' the paper.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.365
That's Edie's paper,
and this is Edie's house.

01:58.389 --> 02:01.198
Do we have to do this now?
I haven't had my coffee yet.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.802
Did you spend the night
with Edie?

02:06.257 --> 02:08.375
Oh, my god.

02:08.399 --> 02:10.336
Susie, just calm down.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.679
You are forbidden
from ever seeing her again.

02:12.703 --> 02:14.681
Do you hear me? Forbidden!

02:14.705 --> 02:17.844
We're divorced. You can't
tell me who I can date.

02:17.868 --> 02:21.688
I live on this street. Your
daughter lives on this street.

02:21.712 --> 02:24.299
I will not have you flaunting
your sexcapades in front of us.

02:24.323 --> 02:25.352
Sexcapades?

02:25.376 --> 02:27.294
Forbidden.

02:27.318 --> 02:30.427
I would love to continue this,
but it's time for breakfast,

02:30.451 --> 02:32.429
and Edie is making me
a frittata.

02:32.453 --> 02:37.233
Oh! Well, I just bet she is.

02:42.693 --> 02:44.676
Mrs. Mayer, I gotta talk to you.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.673
Oh, now is not a good time,
Danny.

02:46.697 --> 02:48.675
You're a month behind
in your payments.

02:48.699 --> 02:50.717
I'll take care of it, I promise.

02:50.741 --> 02:53.180
My dad says, if you read
something and don't pay for it

02:53.204 --> 02:54.887
that's the same as stealing.

02:54.911 --> 02:57.153
Hi, ida. Can we talk
about this later?

02:57.177 --> 02:59.155
I just found out my ex
is dating my neighbor,

02:59.179 --> 03:01.157
and I'm really ticked off.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.660
Save it!
I provide you a service,

03:03.684 --> 03:05.671
and I deserve to be paid
for that service.

03:05.695 --> 03:08.235
Yes, the women of Wisteria Lane

03:08.259 --> 03:11.568
believe Danny Farrell
to be the enemy.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.522
Deadbeat!

03:17.728 --> 03:19.175
They also believed

03:19.199 --> 03:21.348
the enemy of my enemy

03:21.372 --> 03:23.802
is my friend.

03:25.336 --> 03:33.336
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

04:08.879 --> 04:11.227
Beautiful lawns...

04:11.251 --> 04:12.829
Spacious homes...

04:12.853 --> 04:16.303
Happy families...

04:16.327 --> 04:18.365
These are the hallmarks
of suburbia,

04:18.389 --> 04:22.238
but if you look beneath
the veneer of gracious living,

04:22.262 --> 04:25.312
you will see a battle raging...

04:25.336 --> 04:27.474
A battle for control.

04:27.498 --> 04:29.946
You see the combatants
everywhere...

04:29.970 --> 04:32.949
Engaged in their routine
skirmishes... Get outta here!

04:32.973 --> 04:35.722
Fighting fiercely
to have dominion

04:35.746 --> 04:37.724
over the world around them,

04:37.748 --> 04:40.727
all the while knowing...

04:40.751 --> 04:43.560
It's a battle they will lose.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.371
Oh, hey, honey, um,
just stick that anywhere.

04:45.395 --> 04:47.364
I'll take care of it.

04:47.388 --> 04:50.297
Wow. It's really pilin' up.

04:50.321 --> 04:53.269
Oh, uh, don't worry.
I have a system.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.402
Really?

04:55.426 --> 04:57.704
Yeah, every two days, I clean.

04:57.728 --> 04:59.376
Two days.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.549
Yeah, I let the mess accumulate
for two days,

05:02.573 --> 05:05.317
and then I clean until
it's sparkling, and then, uh,

05:05.341 --> 05:07.314
the cycle starts all over again.

05:07.338 --> 05:08.885
And why...

05:08.909 --> 05:11.057
Have I never seen
the sparkling part?

05:11.081 --> 05:13.620
Well, because by the time
you get home from work,

05:13.644 --> 05:15.571
the boys have
messed everything up again.

05:15.595 --> 05:19.326
See? That's what I would call
a flaw in the system.

05:19.350 --> 05:20.667
What are you doin'?

05:20.691 --> 05:22.829
I think I'm asking you
to clean the house.

05:22.853 --> 05:25.340
Really? 'Cause it sounds to me
like you're criticizing me.

05:25.364 --> 05:27.974
No.

05:27.998 --> 05:30.628
No, no, no, no. No.

05:33.404 --> 05:36.413
I'm not saying
it has to be sparkling.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.485
How many times did I come home
to a mess

05:38.509 --> 05:40.487
and I never said a word?

05:40.511 --> 05:42.519
Please, don't take this
the wrong way.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.500
I think you are doing a terrific
job, but let's be clear.

05:44.524 --> 05:47.754
When you came home,
it was to clutter.

05:47.778 --> 05:50.597
I mean, come on, this is...

05:50.621 --> 05:52.621
More than that.

06:01.031 --> 06:03.670
Look at him, just chatting away.

06:03.694 --> 06:06.413
So inconsiderate.

06:06.437 --> 06:09.115
Phyllis, we've only been
waiting here for two minutes.

06:09.139 --> 06:11.778
I told you when we left
the house that I needed to eat.

06:11.802 --> 06:13.580
I have low blood sugar.

06:13.604 --> 06:15.491
Do you wanna see me keel over?

06:15.515 --> 06:18.124
No... in theory.

06:18.148 --> 06:20.927
Here you are.

06:20.951 --> 06:23.460
Thank you.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.032
By the way, Mrs. Van De Kamp,

06:26.056 --> 06:27.834
I heard about
your husband's passing.

06:27.858 --> 06:29.736
I'm so sorry. Dr. Van De Kamp

06:29.760 --> 06:31.768
was one of my favorite
customers, truly.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.040
That's very sweet of you.
Thank you.

06:34.064 --> 06:36.448
I'm not just being polite,
Mrs. Van De Kamp.

06:36.472 --> 06:37.744
How are you feeling?

06:37.768 --> 06:39.746
Well, Mr. Pashmutti...

06:39.770 --> 06:43.770
We're holding up as best
we can under the circumstances.

06:45.636 --> 06:48.785
I'm sorry. This is,
uh, Rex's mother, Phyllis.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.458
I'm so sorry about your son.

06:51.482 --> 06:55.492
Thank you. You know, the hardest
thing is to lose a child.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.494
I can't even imagine.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.026
Come on, Phyllis. Let's get you
something to eat.

07:00.050 --> 07:04.471
We had no warning. I was doing
dishes when I got the call.

07:04.495 --> 07:05.972
Really?

07:05.996 --> 07:10.577
Phyllis, there are
people waiting, so come on.

07:10.601 --> 07:13.580
Excuse me. I... I'm so sorry,

07:13.604 --> 07:15.582
but my son just passed away.

07:15.606 --> 07:17.584
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:17.608 --> 07:18.745
Thank you. I mean,

07:18.769 --> 07:21.087
I was telling
Mr. Pashmutti here,

07:21.111 --> 07:24.591
my life is... is over.

07:25.576 --> 07:29.546
My life is over.

07:31.622 --> 07:34.601
This is ridiculous,
you know that? Pen.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.863
Don't you think I have
better things to do

07:36.887 --> 07:39.105
than to bring you checks
every day,

07:39.129 --> 07:41.107
checks that I could be
signing at home?

07:41.131 --> 07:43.439
This one's dry.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.580
You know, taking away
my access to our account,

07:44.604 --> 07:46.573
that's just vindictive.

07:46.597 --> 07:49.546
Thank you. Do you
know how long it takes me

07:49.570 --> 07:50.947
to schlep out here
to this hellhole?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.679
Exactly. It's the only way
I can guarantee

07:52.703 --> 07:54.681
you'll come and visit me.

07:54.705 --> 07:56.683
That's ridiculous.
You're my husband. I love you.

07:56.707 --> 07:58.755
Obviously, I would come visit.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.757
I thought it was obvious
that when you love someone,

08:00.781 --> 08:03.490
you wouldn't have an affair.
I was wrong, wasn't I?

08:03.514 --> 08:06.633
I'm getting really tired
of this song, Carlos.

08:06.657 --> 08:08.635
Isn't it about time
you forgave me?

08:08.659 --> 08:12.198
You want my forgiveness,
you got it. My trust...

08:12.222 --> 08:14.200
That you're gonna have to earn.

08:14.224 --> 08:16.207
Be careful, Carlos.
Up until now,

08:16.231 --> 08:18.204
I've been really lonely
in that big bed of ours,

08:18.228 --> 08:21.648
but when you're rude to me, it
makes me wanna be not so lonely.

08:21.672 --> 08:23.650
Comments like that
are exactly why

08:23.674 --> 08:25.221
you'll never again
have access to my money.

08:25.245 --> 08:27.053
Why are all rich men jerks?

08:27.077 --> 08:29.177
The same reason
all beautiful women are bitches.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.861
So same time tomorrow?

08:34.885 --> 08:36.684
Sure, baby.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.799
What do you mean, you know?

08:43.823 --> 08:46.533
I mean, I know.

08:46.557 --> 08:48.535
What are you saying, that
your father actually told you

08:48.559 --> 08:51.838
he was gonna be having a one
night stand with Edie britt?

08:51.862 --> 08:53.680
Uh, mom, this wasn't
a one night stand.

08:53.704 --> 08:56.688
He's been going out with Mrs.
Britt for a few months now. What?

08:56.712 --> 08:59.846
How could you not tell me that?
We share everything.

08:59.870 --> 09:02.549
That's what we're known for.
That's our thing.

09:02.573 --> 09:04.691
Because I knew you'd wig out.

09:04.715 --> 09:07.594
Besides, haven't you always told
me to respect people's privacy?

09:07.618 --> 09:09.596
Oh, I've never
applied that concept

09:09.620 --> 09:12.158
to your father's sex life,
and you know it. Are you done?

09:12.182 --> 09:16.703
No! I have not even begun
ripping into Edie britt yet.

09:16.727 --> 09:19.566
Oh, that peroxide vulture.

09:19.590 --> 09:21.838
I just know as sure
as I am standing here

09:21.862 --> 09:25.772
that she went after your father
just to tick me off.

09:25.796 --> 09:26.973
Wrong again. What?

09:26.997 --> 09:28.675
He asked her out.

09:28.699 --> 09:30.647
You lie. It's true.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.318
He called her for a date
six months ago...

09:32.342 --> 09:35.582
The day after my birthday party.

09:35.606 --> 09:37.584
The one at the piano bar?

09:37.608 --> 09:39.726
Yeah.

09:39.750 --> 09:43.189
What is it? Oh, um...

09:43.213 --> 09:45.200
Your father
just came over that day

09:45.224 --> 09:47.193
and told me some stuff.

09:47.217 --> 09:50.566
You know, some stuff
that I haven't...

09:50.590 --> 09:52.038
And can't tell you.

09:52.062 --> 09:55.602
Wait. Whatever happened to
"we share everything"?

09:55.626 --> 09:57.674
Isn't that our thing,
what we're known for?

09:57.698 --> 10:02.348
Um, actually, I think what we're
known for is sharing clothes.

10:02.372 --> 10:05.682
Yeah. I think that's our thing.

10:22.392 --> 10:26.202
Why does he keep doin' that?

10:26.226 --> 10:29.906
He knows it's annoying.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.708
He's just trying to get to us.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.802
Yeah, well, it's working.

10:41.211 --> 10:44.250
Knock it off, down there,
do you hear what I'm saying?!

10:44.274 --> 10:47.684
Matthew. Matthew!

10:49.379 --> 10:50.719
Sit down.

10:57.828 --> 11:00.837
You know we don't talk to him.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.940
That's part of his punishment.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.651
How can you just sit here
hour after hour

11:06.675 --> 11:08.174
and listen to that?

11:08.198 --> 11:13.119
Well, that's part of mine.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.368
Carlos, what is this
big emergency?

11:32.392 --> 11:35.432
I had to cancel my hair
appointment with Eduardo today.

11:38.028 --> 11:40.106
Baby, what is it?

11:40.130 --> 11:43.179
I'm completely freaked out.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.211
Why?

11:45.235 --> 11:49.215
There's this guy,
his name's Richie,

11:49.239 --> 11:51.718
and he's been
saying some stuff to me,

11:51.742 --> 11:54.020
and I'm gettin' worried.

11:54.044 --> 11:56.823
Honey, you and your macho pride.

11:56.847 --> 11:58.995
Just tell him you're flattered,
but you don't swing that way.

11:59.019 --> 12:02.929
He's not hitting on me,
you idiot, he's threatening me.

12:02.953 --> 12:05.271
Really? How?

12:05.295 --> 12:07.403
He said he's gonna beat me up

12:07.427 --> 12:09.075
unless I come up
with some money.

12:09.099 --> 12:11.077
Well, how much money?

12:11.101 --> 12:12.238
$7,000.

12:12.262 --> 12:14.841
$7,000?! Keep your voice down.

12:14.865 --> 12:17.243
Why would he think
you have that kind of money?

12:17.267 --> 12:20.747
Because yesterday, in a visiting
room filled with criminals,

12:20.771 --> 12:23.119
my wife referred to me
as a rich man.

12:23.143 --> 12:26.052
Oh, right. Sorry.

12:26.076 --> 12:28.054
That's why I needed you
to bring the checkbook.

12:28.078 --> 12:30.326
He's actually willing
to take a check?

12:30.350 --> 12:31.858
No.

12:31.882 --> 12:34.906
You're gonna take the money
to his girlfriend,

12:34.930 --> 12:37.433
and if she doesn't get it
by tomorrow, I'm screwed.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.465
Honey, I think
this is a mistake.

12:39.489 --> 12:41.467
If we give in to extortion,

12:41.491 --> 12:43.739
the guy's just gonna keep
coming back for more money.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.972
What choice do I have?

12:45.996 --> 12:48.744
You're a strong guy.
You went to college

12:48.768 --> 12:50.847
on an athletic scholarship,
for god sakes.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.371
Yeah, it was for golf.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.875
Oh.

13:01.511 --> 13:04.060
You have all my pants.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.934
Yeah, I know. Come on in.

13:07.958 --> 13:12.768
I, uh, thought when I took
my stuff back to my house

13:12.792 --> 13:14.270
I got everything.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.834
Oh, it's fine.
They're in the garage.

13:19.830 --> 13:22.879
So how have you been doing?

13:22.903 --> 13:25.083
Good. Um... I'm, uh, good.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.117
I got a question for ya.
Sure, what is it?

13:31.141 --> 13:34.060
Where are we now? Where are we?

13:34.084 --> 13:36.071
Yeah. We're not
moving in together

13:36.095 --> 13:40.086
and we're not broken up,
so where are we?

13:43.593 --> 13:46.372
I don't know.

13:46.396 --> 13:49.906
Since the guy
who held me hostage

13:49.930 --> 13:51.908
turned out to be your son,

13:51.932 --> 13:54.210
I think logic dictates
that I should move on.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.482
The problem is...

13:56.506 --> 13:59.145
I'm crazy about you.

13:59.169 --> 14:02.118
So...

14:02.142 --> 14:05.852
So I'm thinking we should
keep it casual.

14:05.876 --> 14:06.993
Casual.

14:07.017 --> 14:11.357
What the hell does that mean,
exactly, um, casual?

14:11.381 --> 14:13.359
Uh...

14:13.383 --> 14:16.062
Well, I-I don't...

14:16.086 --> 14:18.064
I don't think there's
anything wrong with us

14:18.088 --> 14:20.066
seeing a movie once in awhile.

14:20.090 --> 14:25.471
A movie. Okay. Is that it?

14:25.495 --> 14:28.474
Jogging?

14:28.498 --> 14:31.517
There's no law against jogging.

14:31.541 --> 14:35.021
Anything else?

14:35.045 --> 14:38.885
Shopping. That's casual.
That's fun.

14:38.909 --> 14:40.887
Anything else we can do?

14:40.911 --> 14:43.551
Anything at all?

14:46.056 --> 14:48.434
Mmm, brunch.

14:48.458 --> 14:49.958
Brunch would be nice.

14:56.066 --> 14:59.296
Sounds good to me.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.916
All I can do is take it
one day at a time.

15:09.940 --> 15:13.419
Yes.

15:13.443 --> 15:17.063
Oh, okay. Well...

15:17.087 --> 15:19.525
Thanks so much for calling.

15:19.549 --> 15:22.528
Who was that?

15:22.552 --> 15:26.432
Oh, someone named Alan hanley.

15:26.456 --> 15:29.505
My electrician?

15:29.529 --> 15:31.507
Why were you on the phone

15:31.531 --> 15:33.209
sobbing to my electrician?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.220
Oh, he called to offer you
his condolences.

15:35.244 --> 15:38.044
Then why didn't you put me on?

15:38.068 --> 15:42.048
Oh, well, we got to talking,
and then he had to go.

15:42.072 --> 15:47.053
He... he had some very beautiful
things to say about Rex.

15:48.378 --> 15:50.056
For god sakes, Phyllis,

15:50.080 --> 15:52.058
don't you ever worry
about dehydration?

15:52.082 --> 15:55.031
Are you saying
that I am too emotional?

15:55.055 --> 15:58.134
I'm saying that even Italians
take a break now and again.

15:58.158 --> 16:03.069
My son is dead. I'm grieving.

16:03.093 --> 16:05.216
So am I, but no one
would ever know it

16:05.240 --> 16:07.213
with your incessant
caterwauling.

16:07.237 --> 16:08.944
Bree!

16:08.968 --> 16:10.946
People want to know
how I'm doing,

16:10.970 --> 16:12.448
but the minute they ask,

16:12.472 --> 16:14.450
you... you jump
into the spotlight,

16:14.474 --> 16:16.622
and they forget all about me.

16:16.646 --> 16:19.485
I need consoling, too, Phyllis.
Have you ever thought of that?

16:19.509 --> 16:24.090
I'm sorry.

16:24.114 --> 16:26.292
It won't happen again.

16:26.316 --> 16:27.633
Thank you.

16:27.657 --> 16:28.964
Of course,

16:28.988 --> 16:30.997
if you didn't constantly
suppress your emotions,

16:31.021 --> 16:33.399
people wouldn't forget
to console you.

16:33.423 --> 16:35.501
Excuse me?

16:35.525 --> 16:38.674
Well, it's true. You're stoic
to the point of being cold.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.676
I am not cold. I just...

16:40.700 --> 16:43.509
Well, I don't like
public displays of emotion.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.011
Well, that's fine,

16:45.035 --> 16:47.413
but people wonder

16:47.437 --> 16:49.585
why they haven't seen you cry.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.059
I mean, some people
actually wonder

16:53.083 --> 16:55.661
if you truly mourn Rex.

16:55.685 --> 16:58.424
People have said that?

16:58.448 --> 17:01.448
A few, yes.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.742
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Rita Rivera.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.148
Hi, are you Rita?

17:23.173 --> 17:25.221
Yeah, who are you?

17:25.244 --> 17:29.055
I'm, uh, I'm Gabrielle solis.

17:29.079 --> 17:31.557
Our... our husbands are roommates
at the prison.

17:31.581 --> 17:34.060
Richie and I aren't married.

17:34.084 --> 17:39.465
Oh, I see. Well, uh,
your boyfriend asked my husband

17:39.489 --> 17:42.138
to give this to you.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.592
It's a sort of favor.

17:45.465 --> 17:48.144
It's all there. $7,000.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.238
Son of a bitch!

17:56.176 --> 17:58.206
Oh, don't even think about it.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.129
Um, hello...

18:03.153 --> 18:05.623
Is there a problem?

18:07.857 --> 18:10.196
Let me ask you a question. Okay.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.268
This might seem kind of weird,

18:12.292 --> 18:14.140
but what do you think
of my breasts?

18:14.164 --> 18:17.703
Excuse me? I mean,
how do they look to you?

18:17.727 --> 18:20.246
Uh, they're... they're nice.

18:20.270 --> 18:24.500
Thank you. I like 'em, too.

18:26.376 --> 18:28.254
You're right. That was weird.

18:28.278 --> 18:30.556
You have no idea

18:30.580 --> 18:33.159
what this money is for, do you?

18:33.183 --> 18:34.220
Uh, no.

18:34.244 --> 18:36.162
No. You... you seem

18:36.186 --> 18:38.394
to have everything you need.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.766
Richie wants me
to get a boob job.

18:40.790 --> 18:43.269
He wants 'em bigger.

18:43.293 --> 18:47.233
He's obsessed with huge breasts.

18:50.460 --> 18:53.108
So are you gonna do it?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.110
I told him if he came up
with the cash, I would.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.244
I just never thought the moron
would actually come up with it.

19:00.340 --> 19:05.191
Not that it's any of
my business, but it's your body.

19:05.215 --> 19:07.793
I wouldn't change anything
unless I really wanted to.

19:07.817 --> 19:09.755
But if I don't do it,
he'll leave me.

19:09.779 --> 19:12.358
Honey, he's in jail.
How far is he gonna go?

19:12.382 --> 19:15.169
Maybe it's time you stood up
for yourself.

19:15.193 --> 19:18.234
Tell him you don't need
the surgery.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.865
It's worth a shot.

19:19.889 --> 19:23.389
There you go.
I am so proud of you.

19:37.847 --> 19:40.226
When Lynette went back to work,

19:40.250 --> 19:43.659
she was aware her new job
would be demanding.

19:43.683 --> 19:47.363
What she hadn't anticipated...

19:47.387 --> 19:50.387
Was the night shift.

19:59.569 --> 20:03.509
Hey, honey, I thought I heard
you come in about an hour ago.

20:03.533 --> 20:07.213
I did. I had to load
the dishwasher.

20:07.237 --> 20:09.355
You didn't have to do that.

20:09.379 --> 20:12.358
Yeah, I sorta did.

20:12.382 --> 20:14.560
I'm sorry. I've just
fallen behind on my housework.

20:14.584 --> 20:18.794
I just had so many errands
to run today.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.196
But I'll make up for it
tomorrow, okay? I promise.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.429
That's the beauty of my system...

20:23.453 --> 20:26.232
It's flexible.

20:26.256 --> 20:28.274
You know, for the sake
of our marriage,

20:28.298 --> 20:30.376
please don't mention
the system again.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.378
I said I'm sorry.

20:32.402 --> 20:33.909
What in the world? No, no,
don't touch that. Don't touch that.

20:33.933 --> 20:37.390
Um, penny had a little,
um, spitty-uppy on the sheets.

20:37.414 --> 20:39.385
And you didn't change them?

20:39.409 --> 20:40.686
The towel is very clean.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.918
Oh, that's disgusting. No,
it's just a little spit...

20:42.942 --> 20:44.920
A little milky spit up
on the sheets.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.258
Please, I made a judgment call.
Please respect that.

20:47.282 --> 20:49.255
No, I can't respect that,
and do you know why?

20:49.279 --> 20:50.856
It's stupid.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.898
I'm gonna get new sheets.

20:52.922 --> 20:54.900
We are not changing the sheets.

20:54.924 --> 20:56.802
Why are you yelling at me?

20:56.826 --> 21:00.966
I am not yelling at you, and this
is not about spit up. Of course it is.

21:00.990 --> 21:02.968
No, it isn't.
It's about control.

21:02.992 --> 21:05.279
And as you and I both know, you
have some issues in this area.

21:05.303 --> 21:08.474
Why are you fighting so hard
to sleep on baby vomit?

21:08.498 --> 21:11.347
I am fighting for a principle.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.019
Being too lazy to change
the sheets is not a principle.

21:14.043 --> 21:15.560
You know what?
You're not gonna win this one.

21:15.584 --> 21:18.253
So you'd better just
crawl back into bed,

21:18.277 --> 21:22.847
and let's go to sleep.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.569
No, Tom!

21:33.593 --> 21:35.846
Tom, no! I'm gonna
change the sheets!

21:35.870 --> 21:37.843
Oh, come on! No, you come on!

21:37.867 --> 21:40.005
Just get up! Get up!

21:40.029 --> 21:42.408
That's it! All right, fine!

21:42.432 --> 21:43.679
Fine! Fine! Fine!

21:43.703 --> 21:46.813
Ah!

22:01.651 --> 22:04.970
Normally Lynette would have
spent a sleepless night

22:04.994 --> 22:09.505
telling herself
she didn't have control issues.

22:12.602 --> 22:14.510
But she couldn't.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.583
She was too busy figuring out

22:17.607 --> 22:19.785
how to bend Tom to her will.

22:19.809 --> 22:22.348
Ugh! Aah!

22:25.445 --> 22:27.045
Hello?

22:29.449 --> 22:30.779
Hi.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.333
Welcome to the promised land.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.406
Go on.

22:40.430 --> 22:42.968
There.

22:42.992 --> 22:45.642
Good job!

22:54.073 --> 22:56.882
Uh, Betty? Betty?

22:56.906 --> 22:58.984
Oh, Betty,
can I ask you a question?

22:59.008 --> 23:03.559
Of course. It's Susan, right?

23:03.583 --> 23:05.566
Yes, hi. I was just wondering,

23:05.590 --> 23:08.534
are you having some remodeling
done on your house or something?

23:08.558 --> 23:11.537
No. Why?

23:11.561 --> 23:15.871
Well, uh, I work at home,

23:15.895 --> 23:18.504
so I'm home a lot working.

23:18.528 --> 23:20.806
And I just keep hearing
these noises lately.

23:20.830 --> 23:22.408
Uh, it's hard to concentrate.

23:22.432 --> 23:25.080
Well, I haven't
noticed anything.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.814
Really? It sounds like
it's coming from your house.

23:28.838 --> 23:30.416
You know, it's like
a clanging... clanging.

23:32.482 --> 23:35.991
There! There, that was it.
Did you hear it?

23:36.015 --> 23:39.825
Oh, yes. Matthew's very handy.

23:39.849 --> 23:42.468
He's always doing
projects around the house.

23:42.492 --> 23:44.830
I guess I just don't notice
the noise anymore.

23:44.854 --> 23:46.832
Even at 2:00 in the morning?

23:46.856 --> 23:48.974
'Cause that's kind of
hard to miss.

23:48.998 --> 23:50.476
I'm so sorry.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.578
Matthew is something
of an insomniac, Susan.

23:52.602 --> 23:57.112
But I will talk to him,
and we'll put a stop to it.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.144
Afternoon, Mrs. Mayer.

23:59.168 --> 24:01.008
Hi, Matthew.

24:04.914 --> 24:08.584
Well, it was nice chatting
with you, Susan.

24:13.022 --> 24:16.101
This is my third phone call,
Mr. Flannery.

24:16.125 --> 24:18.464
And if someone
doesn't call me back soon,

24:18.488 --> 24:20.205
I'm going to be irritated.

24:20.229 --> 24:22.568
Is everything all right?

24:22.592 --> 24:24.570
That darn insurance company
is dragging its heels

24:24.594 --> 24:28.574
on paying Rex's policy,
and I don't understand why.

24:28.598 --> 24:30.576
Well, he died unexpectedly.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.700
And that brings up
a lot of questions.

24:34.604 --> 24:39.725
It's probably easier when people
are just diseased.

24:39.749 --> 24:42.688
Probably.

24:42.712 --> 24:45.090
Hi. Hi. Oh, hi, Lynette.

24:45.114 --> 24:47.092
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

24:47.116 --> 24:50.095
No, no, not at all.

24:50.119 --> 24:51.597
I saw you walk in,

24:51.621 --> 24:53.468
and I've been meaning to call
since the service,

24:53.492 --> 24:55.549
but work's been so crazy so...
How are you doing?

24:55.573 --> 24:57.743
Um, I'm all right.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.480
Well, you look amazing.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.812
Do I?

25:06.836 --> 25:08.554
Absolutely.

25:11.040 --> 25:14.660
Well, I can't imagine
what you're going through.

25:18.688 --> 25:20.588
Phyllis?

25:22.622 --> 25:24.570
You're going to have
to stop that.

25:24.594 --> 25:26.802
I can't help it.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.675
When people talk about Rex,
i-i...

25:29.699 --> 25:31.907
I just get emotional.

25:31.931 --> 25:36.542
Well, I'm very sorry
for your loss, too, Phyllis.

25:36.566 --> 25:37.613
He was my firstborn.

25:37.637 --> 25:41.186
I don't know what
I will do without him.

25:41.210 --> 25:44.620
Oh, I'm so sorry.

25:47.847 --> 25:50.525
Is she gonna be okay?

25:50.549 --> 25:55.530
Um, yeah. Sure.
Hold on a second.

26:05.635 --> 26:07.635
There we go. Feel better?

26:09.168 --> 26:11.677
Lynette, you were saying?

26:11.701 --> 26:14.620
I forgot.

26:14.644 --> 26:17.291
That's all right. It was
really sweet of you to stop by.

26:17.315 --> 26:20.046
Okay.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.031
So, uh, are we ready to order,

26:26.055 --> 26:28.585
or do you need
a little more time?

26:31.691 --> 26:33.338
I've been in the insurance
industry for 15 years.

26:33.362 --> 26:36.742
I've never received
a phone call like this.

26:36.766 --> 26:40.205
I'm having second thoughts
about Rex's death.

26:40.229 --> 26:44.579
I've known Rex and Bree
for nearly 20 years.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.860
And I've never had
any reason to suspect

26:46.884 --> 26:50.616
they were anything
but a happy, loving couple,

26:50.640 --> 26:54.910
which is why
this seems so strange.

26:56.385 --> 26:59.324
I found it in Rex's room
after he coded.

26:59.348 --> 27:02.188
"I forgive you"?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.636
George, what are you doing here?

27:41.660 --> 27:43.408
I'm here to kidnap you.

27:43.432 --> 27:45.640
What?

27:45.664 --> 27:50.145
Get your purse.
I'm gonna take you bowling.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.778
I-I don't know how to bowl.

27:52.802 --> 27:55.821
Or to the movies
or for a frozen yogurt.

27:55.845 --> 27:57.923
Whatever you want.

27:57.947 --> 28:00.325
Um, thank you,
but I just couldn't.

28:00.349 --> 28:03.028
Ah, Bree, I'm sure you haven't
gone anywhere in weeks.

28:03.052 --> 28:05.739
You gotta get out and do things.
It'll help. Trust me.

28:05.763 --> 28:08.694
I do. I'm just...

28:08.718 --> 28:10.165
I'm just not ready yet.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.698
But it was very sweet of you
to think of me.

28:12.722 --> 28:15.670
Well, you know, I tried.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.174
And I appreciate that.

28:22.431 --> 28:25.110
It's all right.

28:25.134 --> 28:27.344
Let it out.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.999
You want me to die in here,
don't you?

28:44.023 --> 28:45.771
Carlos, what happened?

28:45.795 --> 28:47.702
What do you mean,
"what happened?"

28:47.726 --> 28:50.876
You talked Rita out of taking the
money. Is that what Richie said?

28:50.900 --> 28:53.839
Yeah, the subject came up
in between kidney punches.

28:53.863 --> 28:55.890
Well, it's not my fault.
She didn't want the money.

28:55.914 --> 28:57.712
Why wouldn't she want $7,000?

28:57.736 --> 29:00.846
Because it's for a boob job. So?

29:00.870 --> 29:04.219
So her boobs are fine.
And, honestly, what he's doing

29:04.243 --> 29:06.491
to her self-esteem
is just cruel.

29:06.515 --> 29:08.493
I feel sorry for her.

29:08.517 --> 29:11.757
Please, you don't care about her
self-esteem any more than I do.

29:11.781 --> 29:13.799
You just didn't want to give up
all that money.

29:13.823 --> 29:15.810
Well, I do think it's silly
to give someone $7,000

29:15.834 --> 29:17.162
if they don't want it.

29:17.186 --> 29:20.806
Listen to me,
you're gonna go back there,

29:20.830 --> 29:23.008
you're gonna put that money
in Rita's hands,

29:23.032 --> 29:26.146
and you're gonna convince her
that life is not worth living

29:26.170 --> 29:28.143
unless she has jugs
the size of Texas.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.767
Do I make myself clear?

29:32.171 --> 29:35.050
I just realized Rita and I
have a lot in common.

29:35.074 --> 29:38.784
Please don't tell me
you have low self-esteem,

29:38.808 --> 29:40.786
'cause if I laugh now,

29:40.810 --> 29:43.859
I'm gonna crack the one good rib
that I have left.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.760
We are both controlled
by our husbands,

29:45.784 --> 29:47.769
which is idiotic because
they're both behind bars.

29:47.793 --> 29:49.134
We should have all the power.
I am not trying to control you.

29:49.158 --> 29:52.067
I just don't wanna end up
in the morgue.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.799
This isn't about that.

29:53.823 --> 29:55.806
Gabrielle,
the morphine's wearing off.

29:55.830 --> 29:57.843
I really don't have time
for these games.

29:57.867 --> 30:00.005
Me either, Carlos.
And if you expect me

30:00.029 --> 30:02.848
to go back and sweet talk her
into getting the operation,

30:02.872 --> 30:04.850
I can't show up empty-handed.

30:04.874 --> 30:06.852
Fine, bring me the checkbook.

30:06.876 --> 30:08.984
I'll make out a check
for some cash.

30:09.008 --> 30:16.421
See I was thinking
I'd be writing the checks.

30:16.445 --> 30:19.024
Gabrielle...

30:19.048 --> 30:22.218
Careful, Carlos, you're not
in a position to argue.

30:29.058 --> 30:31.376
Whoo-hoo! Susan!

30:31.400 --> 30:33.808
Hey, Edie.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.281
So, uh, whee! Ha ha.

30:36.305 --> 30:38.213
How much do you hate me? What?

30:38.237 --> 30:41.086
Oh, Karl said that you know all
about our dirty little secret.

30:41.110 --> 30:44.119
Yes, yes, I do.
Well, I feel awful.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.223
I should have told you
that I was doing your ex.

30:47.917 --> 30:50.095
Well, it would've been
the classy thing to do.

30:50.119 --> 30:52.597
Well, etiquette is a lost art
for a lot of people.

30:52.621 --> 30:54.599
You've gotta believe me,
I never, ever thought

30:54.623 --> 30:56.110
anything would happen with us.

30:56.134 --> 30:58.533
But on our first date,

30:58.557 --> 31:00.535
Karl took me
to a Mexican restaurant.

31:00.559 --> 31:03.038
You know what I get like
when I drink Tequila.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.876
A couple of shooters
and my bra unhooks itself.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.143
Circumstances beyond
your control. I get it.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.475
So if you'll excuse me.

31:10.499 --> 31:11.977
Hey. Hey, hey.

31:12.001 --> 31:15.550
I am offering you
an opportunity here.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.482
I mean, go ahead... vent.

31:17.506 --> 31:18.984
Let me have it.

31:19.008 --> 31:21.326
Come on, tell me
what a bitch I am.

31:21.350 --> 31:23.358
Yeah, for snacking on
your leftovers. I deserve it.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.891
Come on, bring it on. Honestly,
Edie, I don't mind.

31:25.915 --> 31:27.562
You can skate off
into the sunset with Karl.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.916
Be my guest.

31:31.490 --> 31:34.069
Well, that's good to know.

31:34.093 --> 31:36.050
I probably shouldn't
tell you this, but...

31:36.074 --> 31:40.906
While we were in my jacuzzi
last night...

31:40.930 --> 31:45.010
Karl said it was the best sex
he's ever had,

31:45.034 --> 31:46.344
bar none.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.486
Actually, I'm glad
that you shared that,

31:51.510 --> 31:54.089
because here's a tidbit for you.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.193
Karl said he's still
in love with me.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.157
Edie,
what are you doing? You are a lying liar.

32:32.181 --> 32:34.699
We're in the middle
of the street.

32:34.723 --> 32:36.270
Would you get out of here?
Karl never said that.

32:36.294 --> 32:38.703
Okay, Karl asked me
to get back together

32:38.727 --> 32:41.036
the day after Julie's birthday.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.038
I said no, which I'm guessing
is the reason

32:43.062 --> 32:45.340
for the now legendary Tequila
bra-popping incident.

32:45.364 --> 32:47.717
Please let go. Oh,
no. We're not finished here.

32:47.741 --> 32:49.514
Well, yes, we are. I'm gonna go.

32:49.538 --> 32:51.016
You don't have the guts.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.979
In five seconds,
I'm gonna punch it.

32:54.003 --> 32:55.320
Yeah? I'll key your car!

32:55.344 --> 32:57.627
Not if you're sucking
my exhaust, you won't.

32:57.651 --> 33:00.055
Take back what you said! No,
I won't!

33:00.079 --> 33:02.257
Admit it, you'd do anything
to destroy my happiness!

33:02.281 --> 33:04.189
Edie, for god's sake.

33:04.213 --> 33:06.366
Why would I care if you end up
with a man I despise?

33:06.390 --> 33:08.033
'Cause you and Mike
are finished.

33:08.057 --> 33:09.694
Yeah, word's out.

33:09.718 --> 33:11.696
And now that you can't be happy,

33:11.720 --> 33:14.090
you don't want
anyone else to be, period.

33:17.296 --> 33:20.175
Edie, come back here!

33:20.199 --> 33:21.329
We're not finished yet!

33:37.015 --> 33:39.094
It was an accident, Karl.

33:39.118 --> 33:41.126
Edie knows it was an accident,
right?

33:41.150 --> 33:43.668
She knows you could've
killed her.

33:43.692 --> 33:47.132
As it is, she's got
a shattered tibia.

33:47.156 --> 33:49.234
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

33:49.258 --> 33:51.176
I sent roses.
Did she get the roses?

33:51.200 --> 33:53.678
Yep, she cut herself
on the thorns.

33:53.702 --> 33:58.083
Oh, my god.

33:58.107 --> 34:01.046
Why'd you tell Edie
about our little conversation?

34:01.070 --> 34:04.119
Well, she was gloating
about sleeping with you,

34:04.143 --> 34:06.260
and I just wanted
to shut her up.

34:06.284 --> 34:10.024
Oh. So you were jealous?

34:10.047 --> 34:11.356
No!

34:11.380 --> 34:14.699
No! It's just... we were married.

34:14.723 --> 34:17.567
And... and she's trying to make
this tawdry little affair

34:17.591 --> 34:19.304
you guys have going
on par with that.

34:19.328 --> 34:21.166
It's just... I got mad.

34:21.190 --> 34:27.041
Susan, you remember the morning
you saw me with Edie's paper?

34:27.065 --> 34:29.744
Well, the night before,

34:29.768 --> 34:32.677
I had asked her if she'd like
to live together.

34:32.701 --> 34:34.201
And she said yes.

34:38.147 --> 34:40.755
Susan?

34:40.779 --> 34:45.248
Just give me a moment.
I'm asking god to kill me.

34:48.317 --> 34:51.266
Oh, look, she... she's fun.
She goes with the flow.

34:51.290 --> 34:55.270
You know, at this time
in my life, I need that.

34:55.293 --> 34:59.844
Are you... In love with her?

34:59.868 --> 35:02.568
Would you care if I were?

35:06.605 --> 35:09.083
I want you to be happy.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.557
I even sort of want Edie
to be happy. But what?

35:12.581 --> 35:15.660
I wanna be happy first.

35:15.684 --> 35:19.271
Mike and I were supposed to
move in together, you know?

35:19.295 --> 35:22.096
This was supposed to be my time.

35:22.120 --> 35:26.631
I heard you and the plumber
were having problems.

35:26.655 --> 35:29.674
Is it over?

35:29.698 --> 35:31.698
I don't know.

35:36.165 --> 35:38.165
It's really complicated.

35:39.668 --> 35:42.387
So you never answered
my question.

35:42.411 --> 35:46.291
Are you in love with her?

35:46.315 --> 35:48.215
I don't know.

35:50.319 --> 35:52.126
But I can promise you
this much...

35:52.150 --> 35:55.400
I have never loved another woman
the way I loved you.

35:55.424 --> 35:58.803
You walked out on me.

35:58.827 --> 36:01.436
Yeah, but look how far I got.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.608
I'm just up the street.

36:21.310 --> 36:23.628
Mommy, mommy,
thank god, you're home.

36:23.652 --> 36:27.592
Hey, sweet pea.
Why? What's wrong?

36:27.616 --> 36:29.594
Daddy found a rat.

36:29.618 --> 36:33.798
Oh, did he now?

36:33.822 --> 36:37.302
Honey?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.378
I'm home.

36:43.402 --> 36:46.281
Hey, babe. Hey.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.882
Hi, how was your day?

36:47.906 --> 36:51.236
It was good, but,
more importantly, how was yours?

36:52.881 --> 36:55.220
Parker told you
about the rat, huh?

36:55.244 --> 36:57.292
Yep.

36:57.316 --> 36:58.623
Oh, my god,
it was so disgusting.

36:58.647 --> 37:00.625
I came down the steps,

37:00.649 --> 37:03.328
and there it was,
sitting on the counter

37:03.352 --> 37:05.970
eating a leftover
grilled cheese sandwich.

37:05.994 --> 37:08.403
The sandwiches from yesterday?

37:08.427 --> 37:10.405
Okay, yes, the house
has been too messy.

37:10.429 --> 37:13.338
Obviously, my system
has some kinks in it.

37:13.362 --> 37:15.440
But check it out.
I got my act together.

37:15.464 --> 37:16.611
Wow.

37:16.635 --> 37:17.812
So, um,

37:17.836 --> 37:20.315
I take it you took
the rat outside?

37:20.339 --> 37:22.587
Oh, no,
I smashed it with a shovel.

37:22.611 --> 37:24.489
You killed it?

37:24.513 --> 37:27.522
Not with the first blow.

37:27.546 --> 37:31.016
Whew. Disgusting.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.278
Hey...

37:53.302 --> 37:54.819
Little guy.

37:54.843 --> 37:56.821
I just wanted to say

37:56.845 --> 38:00.685
I'm really sorry
about what happened...

38:00.709 --> 38:02.757
With the shovel.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.530
Neither one of us
saw that coming.

38:05.554 --> 38:07.541
I know
it's not much consolation,

38:07.565 --> 38:10.635
but you really helped
my marriage.

38:10.659 --> 38:15.640
That's a lot for a little rat
to accomplish in one lifetime.

38:15.664 --> 38:20.645
Well, it's getting late, so...

38:20.669 --> 38:22.499
Hat's off to ya.

38:34.613 --> 38:37.600
So you'd say the abuse started
a few years into your marriage?

38:37.624 --> 38:40.595
It started so slowly,

38:40.619 --> 38:43.619
I didn't realize
what was happening.

38:45.354 --> 38:48.441
I mean, he'd slap me
over some little problem.

38:48.465 --> 38:50.335
But he'd always apologize.

38:50.359 --> 38:51.676
Then it got worse.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.778
And one day,

38:53.802 --> 38:59.444
eight years ago, my son
spilled soda on our new carpet.

38:59.468 --> 39:01.446
Before I could move
to protect him,

39:01.470 --> 39:03.718
Virgil had knocked him
on the ground

39:03.742 --> 39:05.820
and began kicking him.

39:05.844 --> 39:11.426
I wanted to protect my baby,
but I didn't get there in time.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.358
What happened to your son?

39:13.382 --> 39:17.001
Well, he died.

39:17.025 --> 39:19.404
I came across one of
his baby pictures last weekend.

39:19.428 --> 39:23.738
That's when the nightmares
started again.

39:23.762 --> 39:28.342
The last doctor I saw said that
I needed to let go of my guilt,

39:28.366 --> 39:31.376
and then I would
start sleeping again.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.118
Of course, that's easier said
than done.

39:34.142 --> 39:37.552
And I am getting so tired.

39:39.408 --> 39:44.789
I'm gonna start you
on nitrazepam.

39:44.813 --> 39:46.861
That should do the trick.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.693
Thank you.

39:48.717 --> 39:51.566
I certainly hope your husband
was punished for what he did.

39:51.590 --> 39:56.140
Oh, there was retribution.

39:56.164 --> 40:00.004
I made sure of that.

40:12.941 --> 40:14.919
Where are you off to?

40:14.943 --> 40:16.970
I'm, uh, I'm going to see
Rex's lawyer.

40:16.994 --> 40:21.766
We're going to go over some
details involving Rex's will.

40:21.790 --> 40:24.529
Phyllis...

40:24.553 --> 40:28.032
Obviously, I'm just mortified
over slapping you.

40:28.056 --> 40:32.507
I've... I've just been in
a weird place

40:32.531 --> 40:35.440
since Rex's death, but...

40:35.464 --> 40:38.443
That's no excuse.

40:38.467 --> 40:41.185
I'm very, very sorry.

40:41.209 --> 40:43.417
No need to apologize.

40:43.441 --> 40:47.421
You're family. All's forgiven.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.525
Really?

40:50.549 --> 40:52.527
It's been a difficult time
for all of us.

40:52.551 --> 40:55.429
I totally understand.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.931
Now, go.

40:56.955 --> 41:01.485
You don't want to be late for
your meeting about Rex's will.

41:24.913 --> 41:28.493
Claims. This is Joe flannery.

41:28.517 --> 41:30.535
Hello, um,
could I speak to someone

41:30.559 --> 41:31.596
about the death benefits

41:31.620 --> 41:33.598
for Rex Van De Kamp, please?

41:33.622 --> 41:36.200
This is his mother.

41:36.224 --> 41:39.911
Yes, uh, we've already spoken
to his wife several times.

41:39.935 --> 41:42.476
We are moving as quickly
as we can.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.840
Are you aware that my
daughter-in-law has a boyfriend?

41:49.678 --> 41:52.016
I'm listening.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.719
Control...

41:54.743 --> 41:59.923
It's extraordinary the tactics
people employ to obtain it.

42:02.290 --> 42:06.871
Some rely on deception.

42:06.895 --> 42:12.506
While others engage
in outright trickery.

42:12.530 --> 42:17.511
Then there are those
who resort to extortion.

42:17.535 --> 42:21.085
Why do we fight so hard
for control?

42:22.240 --> 42:24.919
Because we know to lose it

42:24.943 --> 42:28.953
is to put our fate
in the hands of others.

42:30.579 --> 42:33.579
And what could be
more dangerous?
