01:11.800 --> 01:14.849
There is a right way to be single.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.884
Hey. How are you?

01:17.360 --> 01:18.407
Hi.

01:19.920 --> 01:20.921
Oh, when's your wedding?

01:21.160 --> 01:23.640
Eighteen months
after I meet the right guy.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.525
Okay.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.284
And a wrong way to be single.

01:28.560 --> 01:30.210
And then there's this guy.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.846
Good morning.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.091
Hi. You want a hand with that?

01:49.520 --> 01:54.202
We're embarrassed to admit we're single,
and try to pretend that we're not.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.763
We need you in Exam Room 3.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.882
We're supposed to act
all cheerful and happy about it.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.401
What?

02:06.200 --> 02:08.441
But why should we be embarrassed?

02:09.080 --> 02:11.686
We're living longer, marrying later

02:11.840 --> 02:15.845
and refusing to leave the party
before we're really, really done.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.004
So, why do we always tell our
stories through relationships?

02:19.200 --> 02:20.361
Where's home?

02:20.520 --> 02:23.000
Oh, I'm not going home.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.285
No way.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.408
Shit.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.769
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.046
- Here, here.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God...

02:40.760 --> 02:42.762
I gotcha. Here you go.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.284
I did not think this through.

02:52.760 --> 02:53.761
I'm Josh.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.125
I'm Alice.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.489
But this story isn't about relationships.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.927
It's about all those times in between

03:05.120 --> 03:09.444
when maybe, just maybe,
our real life is happening.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.329
This isn't a break-up. Okay?

03:11.480 --> 03:12.766
We're just taking some time apart.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.806
It's temporary. Like, it's...
You know, it's like a break.

03:16.960 --> 03:17.961
Bullshit!

03:18.160 --> 03:21.004
Josh, I've never been on my own.

03:21.560 --> 03:25.647
I went from living with my parents,
to living in a dorm, to living with you.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.685
But we're happy, Alice.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.010
- Are we?
- Yeah.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.605
Or are we just boring?

03:31.920 --> 03:34.526
I'm not boring. I'm fucking fun.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.763
I say I'm gonna do things all the time,
and I never, ever do them.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.321
Like, I'm gonna learn to cook,
or take a self-defense class

03:40.480 --> 03:43.486
or I'm gonna hike the Grand Canyon,
and I never, ever do it.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.687
That's not my fault.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.808
You said the boots made your feet hurt.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.611
Look, if we really want this
to work long term...

03:49.760 --> 03:53.603
I need to know who I am alone and I don't
want to spend my life wondering "What if?"

03:53.760 --> 03:54.761
This is stupid.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.004
The minute you walk out of here you're
gonna realize how much shit I do for you

03:58.160 --> 04:01.845
and how great I am and how much you need
me, and you're gonna start stalking me.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.286
And that's sad.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.326
This is gonna be great for both of us.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.481
Yeah.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.809
We need to know what it's like
to be single, at least once.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.369
Can't you just fuck one of my friends?

04:20.720 --> 04:24.202
Just do something to make me hate you.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.325
This is gonna be the right thing.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.001
Oh, God.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.246
I'm gonna miss your boobs.

05:03.960 --> 05:04.961
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.526
Does this make it work?

05:09.920 --> 05:12.161
Yes! Yes.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.091
There, good. Good.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.049
No. No, no.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.443
Yes. Yes. Okay.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.123
Yes. Yes, yes, good. Oh!

05:25.080 --> 05:26.923
Whoa! Whoa!

05:46.720 --> 05:49.610
Whoa! Whoa! Oh! Oh! Oh!

05:50.040 --> 05:51.041
What the hell are you doing here?

05:51.240 --> 05:52.321
I'm cooking you breakfast!

05:52.520 --> 05:54.170
No, okay. I don't do breakfast.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.481
Right? You need to get out!

05:55.640 --> 05:56.687
You're in my apartment!

05:57.320 --> 05:58.321
Put the...

05:58.680 --> 06:02.241
This is not my apartment.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.971
Fuck. Sorry.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.406
I might be a little drunk.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.561
Oh.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.248
I might actually
wipe my fingerprints off that.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.565
You were great last night.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.690
- Was I?
- I can't remember.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.965
Okay, let's go to your happy place.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.121
What if I poop?

06:21.280 --> 06:22.520
- I won't even notice.
- Oh, God.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.886
It's totally natural.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.611
Women have been doing this
for thousands of years, okay?

06:26.760 --> 06:28.046
Yeah? How many babies have you had?

06:29.440 --> 06:31.841
Well, I've delivered about 3,000 of them.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.001
Didn't you want one?

06:34.400 --> 06:35.401
You know what?

06:35.560 --> 06:39.049
I just felt like society
doesn't let you pursue your dreams

06:39.200 --> 06:40.770
once you have children.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.884
And I didn't feel like
I wanted to give up my identity

06:44.040 --> 06:49.604
to be a slave to some
tiny little love-terrorist.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.810
You know? Plus, your body falls to
shit, and you have no time to exercise

06:52.960 --> 06:55.042
and forget about sleep
for the rest of your life, right?

06:55.760 --> 06:58.366
Oh, no, honey! No, no, no,
no, no, no. You can do it!

06:58.560 --> 06:59.641
No, I can't. My body went to shit.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.086
My body went to shit. It did.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.844
And my vagina's so loose, already!

07:04.000 --> 07:05.684
- Let's push!
- Okay.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.081
Yay!

07:08.720 --> 07:10.609
Is that poop or a baby?

07:11.200 --> 07:12.850
It's not a baby.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.251
Robin? This is Alice, our new paralegal.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.481
Will you give her the tour, please?

07:20.640 --> 07:22.369
Yes, of course.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.011
Thank you.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.161
Hi, I'm Alice.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.731
- Hi.
- It's so nice to meet you.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.651
Yeah. Oh, sorry,
my hands are a little bit creamy.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.168
Okay. All right.

07:34.360 --> 07:39.048
Welcome to the law firm of some guy,
some other guy, and some Jewish guy.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.009
Just kidding. They're all Jewish.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.446
I'm really excited to be here.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.045
This was actually one of my top choices.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.165
That closet there, is really
good for making personal calls.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.489
But whatever you do,
do not hook up in this copy room.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.483
One, it's just, like, so cliché.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.802
And two, there's a security camera.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.249
Oh, I'm not really hooking up
with anybody right now

07:58.400 --> 07:59.640
because recently, I actually...

07:59.800 --> 08:01.086
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.446
They do record the footage.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.922
So, unless a leaked sex tape
is part of your two-year plan,

08:06.080 --> 08:08.082
I'd recommend hooking up in the...

08:11.840 --> 08:13.763
You'll never know our secrets.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.410
You'll never know!

08:15.800 --> 08:16.801
Whoo!

08:23.560 --> 08:25.961
Excuse me. That's none of your business.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.963
You're kind of making it
my business, here.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.930
Look, I just moved in upstairs
and my Wi-Fi sucks.

08:31.080 --> 08:33.967
So, if I have to listen to every drunk
asshole stumble out of here at 5:00 a.m.,

08:34.120 --> 08:35.770
I'm at least gonna use your free Internet.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.486
Wow. Okay, hi. Um...

08:38.919 --> 08:40.729
- I'm Tom. And...
- Hi.

08:40.880 --> 08:41.927
If you're gonna be using my free Wi-Fi,

08:42.120 --> 08:44.407
at least you can do me a favor
and not write shit like,

08:44.560 --> 08:46.562
"I want to wake up with my best friend."

08:46.720 --> 08:48.165
Unless you want my dick to fall off.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.206
And then maybe we could become
best friends, and that'd be awesome.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.606
Look, I spent half of last year
creating an algorithm

08:54.800 --> 08:56.643
that trolls dating apps
for the best candidates

08:56.800 --> 08:58.529
and downloads them
into an Excel spreadsheet.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.200
So, I know what I'm looking for.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.441
Yeah, that's not weird at all.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.890
What are you really doing online?

09:05.040 --> 09:06.485
I mean, you're a pretty girl.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.641
This is New York City.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.410
There's like a billion people
outside that door.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.568
Yeah, but how many eligible people?

09:11.760 --> 09:15.321
Here. Okay, there are eight
million people in this city.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.484
- Sounds like a lot, right?
- It does.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.404
But, half of them are women.

09:19.560 --> 09:23.250
And as hard as I tried in college,
I don't swing that way.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.765
- How hard did you try?
- Let it go.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.689
- Okay.
- So, four million men.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.764
And then you got to have some age limits.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.485
- Let's say over 20.
- Gotta keep it legal.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.369
- Under 40.
- Keep it sexy.

09:32.520 --> 09:33.521
Now, it's a million.

09:33.800 --> 09:37.009
Right. We're talking about a million guys.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.680
But half of them are married.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.009
10% are gay.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.730
I want someone college educated.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.848
Not too ugly.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.202
- So...
- There's your boyfriend.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.401
I wish.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.362
He's got to be taller than me...

09:53.120 --> 09:56.124
And he's got to want kids.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.443
So, yeah, I'm on 10 different
dating websites to increase my odds.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.761
So, what do you say?

10:01.920 --> 10:03.365
You let me treat this bar
like it's my living room

10:03.520 --> 10:06.364
and I won't call the cops every night
with a noise complaint.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.841
Okay. Very cute.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.890
- These are the women?
- Hmm.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.361
Thanks.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.929
Mmm. Mmm.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.521
See you around.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.121
Stupid.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.361
Have a nice night.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.522
Wait. What? Where are you going?

10:21.840 --> 10:24.128
- I'm going home.
- What?

10:24.280 --> 10:27.011
I never want to hear you
say that again. Ugh!

10:27.240 --> 10:30.801
You're single now, okay?
You do not go home!

10:31.000 --> 10:32.240
You shouldn't even have a home.

10:32.440 --> 10:33.885
You should just have 500 square feet

10:34.040 --> 10:35.963
where you keep some clothes
and occasionally bathe.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.771
Well, okay, technically,
I'm not, like, single.

10:38.920 --> 10:39.967
We're just on a break.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.321
Uh, there's no such thing as a "break,"
Season-3 Ross.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.766
No, we really are on a break.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.445
We're just taking
a little bit of time apart

10:46.600 --> 10:48.648
to make sure
we really want to be together.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.201
Oh, so you're on some
kind of sexual rumspringa?

10:51.360 --> 10:53.328
- No.
- Why didn't you say anything?

10:53.480 --> 10:54.925
I could've made you take a half-day!

10:55.120 --> 10:56.121
It was my first day at work.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.367
Rumspringa!

10:57.520 --> 10:59.568
What? No! Where are we going?

10:59.840 --> 11:01.968
Ask me for a rum and coke
if you think you're gonna die.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.451
Get out of here!

11:03.720 --> 11:07.805
Uh... You said on your profile
you're a big dreamer.

11:08.240 --> 11:09.241
No, please.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.802
No, no, I think I want
what everybody wants.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.962
Cross off some things on the bucket list.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.600
So, what is on your bucket list?

11:17.760 --> 11:18.761
Usual stuff.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.365
- Uh, Wrigley Fields.
- Mmm...

11:20.520 --> 11:21.646
- Dolphin Trainer.
- Oh, boy.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.007
Oh, my God. I love dolphins.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.440
Loved, since forever.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.444
Wow, no, no, you know, because the normal
ones are already checked off, you know?

11:28.680 --> 11:30.125
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hot Carl.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.121
- Dirty Sanchez.
- Yeah, that's...

11:32.280 --> 11:33.770
- Golden Shower. That one.
- Oh.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.644
I actually checked off by accident.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.041
Thank you, prom.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.647
So, these aren't career goals
or life goals.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.446
These are more sexual things.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.051
Have you ever heard of the Whack-a-Mole?

11:45.280 --> 11:46.281
Rum and coke.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.766
Rum and Coke? Really?

11:47.960 --> 11:50.246
I didn't think you'd want to do a Rum
and Coke with me on our first date.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.801
- Um, rum and coke?
- I got to find a live hamster.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.007
So, I guess I could trap a street rat.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.161
I mean, we are in New York.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.169
- Rum and coke!
- I got to go shave my legs.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.567
- Drink more water.
- Oh. Okay.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.721
Yo.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.046
Go lock yourself in my office.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.366
Thank you.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.290
Here we go.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.884
Let me teach you how to be single.

12:11.320 --> 12:14.449
Okay, lesson one. Go get us some drinks.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.761
Okay.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.645
No. That was a trick.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.606
You don't buy the drinks.
Boys buy the drinks.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.202
It's kind of like a sexual currency
that they use,

12:24.360 --> 12:26.488
so they're not actually
paying you to hook up.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.570
So, go get us a drink.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.882
- Okay.
- Not... Not with this wallet.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.644
- Okay.
- With the sausage wallet.

12:32.800 --> 12:33.847
Which of you is buying oil right now?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.001
Do you know how much...

12:35.200 --> 12:36.725
Hey, what's up, y'all?

12:37.160 --> 12:38.730
I don't know why I just said "y'all."

12:38.920 --> 12:41.446
"You all" would have taken
just as much time.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.929
And I'm not even from the South,
I'm from Portland.

12:45.280 --> 12:48.363
Which is southern from Canada.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.601
Are y'all Canadian?

12:49.760 --> 12:51.808
I just did it again, I said it again.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.810
My system should have weeded him out.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.650
You probably read your data wrong.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.008
I bet that guy told you
exactly who he was.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.286
You just didn't want to hear it.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.010
I tell the truth to girls all the time.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.685
They hear what they want to hear.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.405
That sounds like a load of crap.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.167
I'm not kidding. Watch this.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.842
- Hey, sweetheart. Hey.
- Hi.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.049
Hey, uh, you know we're only
sleeping together for fun, right?

13:14.240 --> 13:16.447
Because I'm not interested
in long-term relationships,

13:16.600 --> 13:19.680
so I think I'm gonna start seeing other
people and I think you should move on, too.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.605
Because I care about you,

13:22.760 --> 13:24.603
and I don't want to see you get hurt.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.445
Oh, I care about you, too.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.485
Yeah. Hmm.

13:32.920 --> 13:33.921
Wow.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.284
You guys are super dressed-up. Funeral?

13:38.160 --> 13:39.446
Oh, my God. Okay, bye.

13:39.600 --> 13:40.931
That was a really bad idea.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.969
This is stupid.
I should probably just go home.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.121
- It's better.
- No, are you kidding?

13:44.280 --> 13:47.723
You have a small window in which to
bang your way through New York City.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.804
No, Josh and I didn't break up
so I could see other people.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.724
I'm trying to figure out who I am.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.368
Then why don't you take this,
go home and stare at your beave?

13:58.280 --> 14:00.203
Look, I'm just gonna
choose for you. All right?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.329
Um... I know.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.165
I would like to see your tongue
in that bartender's face.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.361
What?

14:06.520 --> 14:07.601
Don't worry, I know him.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.524
He's like a palate cleanser.
He's sexual sorbet.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.681
That guy?

14:10.880 --> 14:12.609
Yeah. I've heard he's really good in bed.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.127
From myself,
because I might have slept with him.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.441
I can't really remember.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.011
Maybe, uh... It was winter.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.527
Maybe I just used his dick
as a scarf. Let's go.

14:20.680 --> 14:21.681
What?

14:21.920 --> 14:22.967
Hey, Tom.

14:23.120 --> 14:26.646
This is Alice. She's newly single and
needs to hook up with a random stranger.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.928
Let me buy you a drink. Here you go.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.366
- Thanks.
- Uh, thanks.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.967
Let me buy you a drink.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.686
Welcome to the party.

14:36.680 --> 14:37.681
Umm, cheers.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.289
Whoo!

14:42.840 --> 14:44.808
Come on! Yeah! Ha!

14:55.240 --> 14:56.446
- Hi!
- Yeah!

15:00.200 --> 15:01.201
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.888
Whoa! Whoa!

15:19.320 --> 15:21.004
She just hit you in the face!

15:22.320 --> 15:23.890
- Oh!
- Rumspringa!

15:36.640 --> 15:37.766
Morning, sunshine.

15:37.920 --> 15:38.921
No.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.410
No, Meg! Ow!

15:45.000 --> 15:46.365
Oh, my God.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.170
Wakey-wakey.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.810
A doctor?

15:53.040 --> 15:55.486
Did I have sex with a doctor?
Did we have sex?

15:56.280 --> 15:57.361
- No.
- No?

15:57.560 --> 15:59.244
No, we didn't have sex.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.528
- I didn't sleep with anybody?
- No, I don't think so.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.686
Why does it smell like weed in here?

16:03.840 --> 16:05.842
- You have a little...
- What?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.650
It's in your hair now.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.007
It's just right...

16:10.520 --> 16:11.521
- What?
- It...

16:11.720 --> 16:13.529
No, I just have long eyelashes.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.760
It's a... You have a joint clinging...

16:16.960 --> 16:18.007
Oh...

16:18.600 --> 16:20.204
Yay! Free coffee!

16:23.400 --> 16:26.131
Uh, take two Tylenol,
and make yourself some breakfast.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.361
I love you.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.602
Love, love you.

16:30.480 --> 16:33.563
Your roommate seems pretty cool.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.763
Oh, she's my sister.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.646
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.964
Uh, then I think I might have pissed
in your sister's litter box.

16:43.680 --> 16:44.681
That's a Zen garden.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.450
The cat has a Zen garden?

16:46.600 --> 16:47.601
There's no cat.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.481
Where am I?

16:49.640 --> 16:51.768
I knew I had sex in this apartment!

16:51.920 --> 16:53.331
- Oh, yeah.
- What's up?

16:54.400 --> 16:56.448
Okay, where are we?

16:56.600 --> 16:59.570
- Um, Broadway and 77th.
- Um...

16:59.720 --> 17:02.451
We have to be at work in 30 minutes,
so we should probably go this way.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.364
It's okay, I can do this in 20.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.681
- Wait, do what?
- Let's go.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.204
- Wait, do what?
- Time me!

17:10.160 --> 17:11.320
Step one.

17:11.480 --> 17:12.970
That stuff is for babies.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.241
Babies with hangovers.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.527
Baba, are we good?

17:25.200 --> 17:26.804
Payment accepted. Let's go.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.001
Hi!

17:52.280 --> 17:53.884
Yeah, hi. I'm really interested

17:54.040 --> 17:58.166
in buying a lot of your products but first
I need you to put all of them on my face,

17:58.320 --> 18:00.288
in a very nice way, for free.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.726
I'm gonna need a full face,
with a side of "Wow."

18:03.880 --> 18:04.881
Okay.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.249
Mimosa, hold the orange juice.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.166
Here. Come on. Gimme.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.401
Nailed it.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.290
You're three-and-a-half hours late.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.762
Yay! Lunchtime!

18:31.760 --> 18:32.761
And don't worry about the weight.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.008
It should come off
after you stop nursing the infant.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.050
- Katie. That's her name.
- Oh, okay.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.804
Oh, no. I have to pee.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.485
It just falls out of me these days.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.681
- Can you hold...
- No, no, no, no, no.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.211
I'm not good with babies.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.810
Hello. How are you today?

18:49.280 --> 18:51.760
Your mom should be coming back soon.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.086
Is, um, Katie short for Katherine?

18:56.640 --> 18:59.644
See, some women
would look at what you just did

18:59.800 --> 19:01.370
and think that you smiled.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.124
But, because I'm a doctor,

19:03.280 --> 19:07.763
I know that that was probably
just an involuntary tic, or gas.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.561
You know what?

19:10.720 --> 19:14.682
You're not that cute,
and I am not falling for it.

19:14.880 --> 19:18.248
So, you just keep trying, but it is "no."

19:21.360 --> 19:22.885
Shut up, baby.

19:23.040 --> 19:26.203
And, you know what? Don't touch that,
because that's not very sanitary.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.930
Yeah.

19:28.120 --> 19:31.124
Germs are little bugs,
like little microbes

19:31.280 --> 19:34.204
that get into your mouth,
and they make you sick.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.171
So, you eat your shoe.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.764
You are not winning me over.
No, you're not.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.488
Why do you put everything in your mouth?

19:46.640 --> 19:50.008
Hello. Hi.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.249
And so we're clear,
there are a lot of people in this world

20:04.400 --> 20:06.767
who need things like you in their lives,

20:06.920 --> 20:08.445
to feel complete.

20:08.640 --> 20:12.964
I am not one of them.
I am fine without you.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.564
Fine. You win.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.881
If Tom texts you, which he won't,
because it's still daylight,

20:43.040 --> 20:44.485
wait four hours to respond.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.762
I was not even thinking about Tom.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.127
Anything sooner implies
that you're needy and really co-dependent

20:49.280 --> 20:51.801
and incapable of a simple hookup,
which is all he's good for.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.644
I think that I could actually
be, like, a good...

20:53.800 --> 20:55.564
And, when you respond,
do not respond in full sentences.

20:55.720 --> 20:56.721
Okay.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.684
And if you use an emoji,
I will fucking tit-punch you.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.001
Fine.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.287
Fine.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.409
No! No! Oh, no.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.210
You can have this back
at the end of the day.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.441
Fine.

21:17.800 --> 21:18.881
An emoji?

21:19.160 --> 21:22.528
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.084
- This is so dumb.
- Okay.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.685
It's not like I don't know
you're bad for me.

21:28.840 --> 21:29.841
Sure.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.126
And I'm not gonna be
one of those clichéd girls

21:31.280 --> 21:32.805
who thinks I can, like,
change you, or something.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.041
- No, you can't.
- No.

21:42.640 --> 21:43.641
I'm telling you.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.684
Sex? It's the best way
to find out what you want.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.322
Think about it,
the whole love thing, the whole,

21:49.480 --> 21:51.369
"I just want a guy
to notice when I'm cold."

21:51.520 --> 21:53.926
It's nice when a guy notices
when you're cold. It means he's...

21:54.120 --> 21:57.930
It means he's faking it, because he knows
that's what you want to hear.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.245
So, instead of being a psycho who pretends
that I give a shit if you're cold,

22:01.400 --> 22:03.164
I tell everyone the same thing.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.607
"If you're looking for the one,
that's not me.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.647
"If you're looking for the one
to have a little fun with, I'm that one."

22:10.400 --> 22:12.721
- Oh.
- Yep.

22:12.920 --> 22:16.367
- Whew!
- I've always been in relationships.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.962
But, I guess
that's just because I actually

22:19.120 --> 22:21.168
don't really know how to stay single.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.725
Then you came to the right place.

22:23.320 --> 22:26.403
The trick is to love them,
but get them to leave you.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.641
That way, nobody gets hurt.

22:27.800 --> 22:28.801
Check this out.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.650
What do all these things
have in common? Go.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.242
Um, ketchup and beer.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.084
Pickles, chocolate sauce.

22:36.520 --> 22:37.601
Are you pregnant?

22:37.760 --> 22:40.161
No, they can't be used to make breakfast.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.606
There's no reason
to stick around in the morning,

22:41.760 --> 22:42.966
because you can't make an omelet.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.202
Plus, no water. So, hungover chicks...

22:45.960 --> 22:47.405
You got to leave to survive.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.725
Except for that New York water is delicious
and you can just drink it from the tap.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.803
Yeah. But, uh...

22:53.360 --> 22:55.442
From... What...

22:55.640 --> 22:57.642
- Glass?
- Wow!

22:57.960 --> 22:58.961
You're a piece of work.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.281
Mmm-hmm.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.481
Glass.

23:04.680 --> 23:08.127
Okay, MacGyver, no woman's
gotten this far, but, um...

23:11.920 --> 23:13.410
You had a plumber cut your water?

23:13.560 --> 23:15.483
No. I did it myself.

23:15.640 --> 23:16.721
What if you need to wash your hands?

23:16.880 --> 23:18.041
What am I, a surgeon?

23:18.360 --> 23:19.771
What if you get thirsty?

23:22.600 --> 23:24.170
- Nice. Well done.
- Yeah, right?

23:24.320 --> 23:25.651
Totally thought it was a nightstand,
didn't you?

23:25.840 --> 23:27.080
You're a psycho.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.129
I'm not a psycho.
Look, most guys are like me,

23:29.280 --> 23:30.770
they're just not honest about it.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.081
I'm telling you,

23:33.000 --> 23:34.729
this is what it's like out there.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.441
Why are you telling me this?

23:37.920 --> 23:38.921
I don't know.

23:39.280 --> 23:42.443
It's just... You're different.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.124
Oh, my God.
That's the thing you say to girls.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.446
Yes, it is. Works, though, right?

23:50.600 --> 23:51.601
Completely.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.006
Anyway, end of the tour.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.686
And, um, this was fun.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.008
See you.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.241
Hi.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.366
Uh, mimosa?

24:36.840 --> 24:39.525
Uh, no, I'm actually
on my way to a meeting.

24:39.680 --> 24:42.729
So, I'm probably not gonna start drinking
at 8:30 on a Thursday.

24:43.200 --> 24:47.091
Yeah, no, I didn't...
I don't want one, either.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.404
Um, I got us chocolate chip pancakes
for the table, like we used to.

24:50.640 --> 24:54.326
Um, cool.
I don't have a lot of time, so...

24:54.480 --> 24:56.448
Okay, no, then I'll just get right to it.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.244
I'm done. I'm... I'm finally done.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.564
What? What are you done with?

25:04.720 --> 25:05.846
With our time apart.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.126
I know it's been really difficult.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.691
It's been difficult on both of us.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.561
But, I'm finally ready
for us to be together.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.201
And I'll never have to wonder
about anything else.

25:16.440 --> 25:17.441
I'm seeing someone.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.046
That is...

25:22.200 --> 25:23.247
Congratulations.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.601
Um...

25:25.840 --> 25:30.289
So, then, so, Josh, you want to just,
like, tell me when you're done, then?

25:30.440 --> 25:32.044
I don't know, Alice.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.884
Like, we can...
We'll just wait till you're done.

25:34.840 --> 25:35.966
Shit's different, I'm not...

25:36.120 --> 25:39.602
I'm not sure I want
the same things anymore.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.411
You mean, like, me?

25:48.520 --> 25:50.841
I didn't need an experiment
to know that I loved you.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.127
And I'm not an idiot.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.086
You're, I guess, done with
whatever you've been doing

25:58.280 --> 26:02.882
with whoever you've been doing, and you
think you can come running back to me?

26:03.080 --> 26:05.845
No, thanks. I'll pass.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.320
Who ordered pancakes?

26:13.040 --> 26:15.361
Meg, I'm not ready to be alone. I'm not.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.290
I don't know how to reset my router.

26:17.480 --> 26:18.481
I don't even know where it is.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.569
I don't even really know
what, exactly, it does.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.811
I'm gonna be alone forever.

26:23.400 --> 26:26.609
At least my dead body
will serve as food for my cats.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.406
In the eight weeks that it
takes for anybody to find me,

26:30.560 --> 26:32.164
because nobody gives a fuck.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.522
Why are you watching Bridget Jones?

26:34.680 --> 26:35.806
What did I tell you?

26:35.960 --> 26:37.166
It feels good in the moment.

26:37.360 --> 26:39.886
I know, but it's a bad idea.

26:40.040 --> 26:44.204
You get yourself all hopped up
on Sex and the City and Bridget Jones

26:44.360 --> 26:47.523
and thinking that you need to have some
big single experience.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.684
- Which, by the way, is total bullshit.
- No.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.888
All those girls ever did
was look for boyfriends.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.609
And this is a great thing,
because now you can focus on your career.

26:56.800 --> 27:00.884
What? No! I put myself out, into the
world, and it completely rejected me.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.201
Whoa!

27:02.720 --> 27:05.291
Okay, you haven't been single
for that long!

27:05.440 --> 27:06.441
Yeah.

27:06.640 --> 27:09.962
You got to go around the board,
pass "Go," collect 200 dicks.

27:10.120 --> 27:13.487
And you remember the best thing
that ever happened to me

27:13.640 --> 27:15.449
was when I was thinking about
quitting medical school.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.329
Please don't tell
the medical school story.

27:17.480 --> 27:21.601
And then, my piece of shit boyfriend,
Bobby, cheated on me with my lab partner,

27:21.760 --> 27:25.287
because she was willing
to do things that I wasn't.

27:25.440 --> 27:26.646
Did it involve midgets?

27:27.720 --> 27:28.721
No.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.128
I once slept with an albino.

27:32.280 --> 27:35.090
Anyway, the good news is, now there are...

27:35.240 --> 27:38.201
3,000 beautiful babies in the world
and no one can take that away

27:38.400 --> 27:39.401
- ...from me.
- ...from her.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.449
Why don't you go
to one of those alumni events?

27:41.600 --> 27:42.601
An alumni event?

27:42.800 --> 27:45.201
You go, and you network with people

27:45.360 --> 27:48.330
and if you really love what you do

27:48.520 --> 27:51.364
then the whole guy thing is easier.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.728
No! I don't want to be like you, Meg.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.326
I don't want my job to be my entire life.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.561
Ooh.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.922
Okay. Sisters, time-out.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.441
There are pros and cons
to both of you, okay?

28:04.600 --> 28:07.206
Pros. Young, beautiful.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.204
Pros. Also beautiful, for your age.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.601
Rich. Doctor. Access to pills.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.524
Cons. No access to pills.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.523
Cons. You're really stingy with the pills.

28:16.720 --> 28:17.721
Right.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.285
Pros. Loves me unconditionally.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.169
Gives me the spare key to the apartment.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.560
Has a very nice underwear drawer.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.046
Very neat and organized.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.440
You have a key to my apartment?

28:25.640 --> 28:27.290
Cons. Asks too many personal questions.

28:28.280 --> 28:33.286
Okay. I'm gonna take my old, lonely,
workaholic ass back to the hospital.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.166
Cons. Ugly when sad.

28:46.680 --> 28:49.729
- Hey, did you bring a sandwich from home?
- Mmm.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.522
Are you wearing pajamas in a bar?

28:52.680 --> 28:53.681
They're sweatpants.

28:53.840 --> 28:54.841
I think you're bumming some people out.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.088
You might want to take your
"give up" pants and go home.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.241
Leave me alone.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.324
I love this bar.

29:01.480 --> 29:02.925
Lucy?

29:04.320 --> 29:05.321
Lucy?

29:05.480 --> 29:06.481
Hi!

29:07.240 --> 29:08.526
Oh, my God!

29:08.720 --> 29:10.324
Brittany! Hi!

29:10.480 --> 29:11.845
- How are you?
- How are you?

29:12.080 --> 29:13.081
I'm getting married!

29:13.240 --> 29:14.446
She's getting married!

29:15.080 --> 29:18.368
That is just the best news
I've ever heard in my entire life!

29:18.520 --> 29:19.681
Oh, yay!

29:19.840 --> 29:20.887
How old are your kids?

29:21.280 --> 29:22.520
No.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.970
I don't have any.
I just read to them sometimes.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.251
But not in, like, a sad way.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.323
It's more like a volunteer thing?

29:30.760 --> 29:31.761
Oh. Oh.

29:32.240 --> 29:33.651
Yeah. Yeah.

29:33.800 --> 29:34.961
So, are you married?

29:35.240 --> 29:36.480
No. No.

29:36.640 --> 29:37.641
Dating anyone?

29:37.880 --> 29:39.086
Afraid not.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.526
Are you divorced?

29:40.680 --> 29:42.409
No, no one's ever loved me enough

29:42.560 --> 29:44.403
to eventually divorce me.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.371
You got to get in the game,
before you can lose, so...

29:47.520 --> 29:51.366
I'm not even a good loser, yet.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.445
Oh, my God, are those penis straws?

29:53.640 --> 29:55.802
You guys are gonna have
a crazy night tonight!

29:55.960 --> 29:56.961
Hi...

30:05.640 --> 30:06.766
Hey, baby.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.571
This is, um...

30:09.720 --> 30:12.803
It's all right, you can say it.
Miss Independent right here, right?

30:12.960 --> 30:13.961
I'm her boyfriend.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.685
- Oh...
- He's your boyfriend.

30:15.880 --> 30:16.881
This is my boyfriend.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.765
God, doesn't she look smoking hot
in these sweatpants?

30:19.960 --> 30:21.962
Oh, wow, that's so sweet.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.168
This is Brittany.
She's getting married, obviously.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.367
Oh, you're the one getting married.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.244
Marriage!

30:27.600 --> 30:29.762
The end of spontaneous sex,
traveling by yourself

30:29.920 --> 30:32.605
and buying whatever you want
without having to ask permission, right?

30:34.320 --> 30:35.810
Marriage!

30:35.960 --> 30:38.850
Congratulations, good luck with it.
I hope it lasts.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.688
Sorry. No filter.

31:03.520 --> 31:06.046
Hey, listen. I hope, uh,
that kiss wasn't too much.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.726
Oh, my God. No, no, that was awesome!

31:08.880 --> 31:11.804
Thank you so much! Good night.

32:00.880 --> 32:03.042
Come on, you fucking bitch.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.081
Hey.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.841
Sorry. Was that supposed to be
a private moment?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.490
I can't get my zipper.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.291
I'm sorry for what I said to you.

32:14.440 --> 32:15.441
What?

32:15.600 --> 32:16.761
I said, I'm sorry for what I said to you.

32:16.920 --> 32:17.921
Can't hear you.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.842
I said I'm sorry for what I said to you!

32:26.160 --> 32:28.003
What?

32:28.560 --> 32:30.483
I'm gonna have a baby.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.369
- What?
- I found a sperm donor.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.648
This guy. He's of Swedish descent.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.245
- Oh, my God.
- He has no known cancers

32:36.400 --> 32:39.131
on either side of his family,
no history of drug abuse.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.362
No history of any kind
of mental illness, or...

32:41.560 --> 32:42.925
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.923
Oh, my God.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.645
I know.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.645
Wait. Do you think it's a bad idea?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.370
Why are you saying
"Oh, my God" five times?

32:51.520 --> 32:53.010
No, but... Wait, when do you meet him?

32:53.200 --> 32:54.201
That's the best part.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.648
I never, ever have to meet him,
or any of his family.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.609
There's no strings attached at all.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.285
Nothing. Is that crazy?

33:01.440 --> 33:04.011
No. Oh, my God, you're gonna have a baby.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.049
- I know!
- You're gonna have a baby!

33:06.600 --> 33:08.364
I'm so happy for you.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.563
You'll always be my baby first.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.161
But you do need to grow up.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.485
And you do need to move out
by this Friday.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.681
What?

33:17.880 --> 33:19.450
The co-op board found out you were here.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.563
Is this a bad idea? Would you tell me?

33:21.720 --> 33:23.802
No, you're gonna be
the best mom in the world.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.200
Wait. Just go back.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.681
What was that thing
that you just said about the co-op board?

33:27.840 --> 33:29.046
You need to be out by Friday.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.130
But you're allowed to have guests.

33:32.320 --> 33:36.006
Yes. But my guests aren't allowed
to slide down the trash chute, naked.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.123
I didn't go naked down the...

33:38.760 --> 33:40.330
Oh.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.444
- Robin did that.
- Mmm-hmm.

33:43.160 --> 33:45.447
I've seen security footage. And it just...

33:45.640 --> 33:46.846
Hmm.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.326
I don't know.

34:07.680 --> 34:10.964
It seems kind of homey, like you'd
actually want to spend time here.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.283
Oh, this could be a reading window.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.283
Reading is for ugly losers.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.929
I don't know. I really like it.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.650
Yeah, but, I mean... Oh!

34:19.800 --> 34:20.847
Wait! No, don't do that!

34:21.000 --> 34:22.967
That just... That just fell off.

34:23.159 --> 34:24.286
I think I'm gonna take it.

34:24.440 --> 34:25.771
This place is dangerous.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.251
It's perfect.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.130
Don't let that... Don't...

34:30.800 --> 34:32.962
- Did that just break?
- Yeah.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.890
Good night.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.405
That was weird.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.481
Maybe you should just leave it in there.

35:45.640 --> 35:46.926
Maybe you shouldn't shake it like that.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.531
What, it's gonna make the pee go in there.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.081
No, it doesn't work like that.
That's not a Polaroid.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.089
I'm gonna be the best auntie, ever. I am.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.770
I'm gonna give that kid whatever it wants.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.530
Forever. All the sugar in the world.

35:56.680 --> 35:57.966
Don't get your hopes up, okay?

35:58.120 --> 35:59.804
Because it never works on the first time.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.166
It's too late.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.081
Mmm.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.808
See? I told you.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.766
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

36:10.920 --> 36:13.241
No, it always... This is...

36:13.440 --> 36:15.886
It doesn't usually work
on the first time, like I said.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.771
What?

36:22.080 --> 36:24.890
I deal with this kind of thing
all the time. You know that.

36:26.840 --> 36:27.966
Are you drinking enough water?

36:28.160 --> 36:30.527
Your lips are really dry,
which means you're dehydrated.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.324
I'll go get you some water.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.121
These plums are available through
late summer, early autumn.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.281
Alice!

36:44.480 --> 36:47.290
And they're just wonderful,
they're called Italian prune plums.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.566
So, we're gonna make
a little bit of caramel

36:50.720 --> 36:53.451
with a cup of sugar,
and a third of a cup of water.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.849
I'm just gonna cook it over medium heat
until it's nice and caramelized and brown...

36:57.000 --> 36:58.047
Alice!

37:02.040 --> 37:03.565
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:03.720 --> 37:04.801
My buzzer's broken.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.531
It's like if Romeo and Juliet
had lived in New York.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.688
That was bad. Can I come up?

37:09.840 --> 37:10.841
Yeah.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.802
If you want to make
this cake another time...

37:34.880 --> 37:35.881
Hey.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.286
Hey.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.606
It's good to see you.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.331
So good to see you. What's up?

37:41.880 --> 37:44.770
Well, I was going through my closet,
and I found a bunch of your old stuff,

37:44.920 --> 37:47.002
so I thought you might want it.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.840
I could've come by to get this.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.643
Well, actually,
that's the thing, is, um...

37:58.480 --> 38:00.289
That's part of why I wanted to come over.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.521
Uh...

38:02.080 --> 38:05.880
So, Michelle is moving in tomorrow.

38:06.800 --> 38:09.041
- So...
- Wow!

38:10.640 --> 38:12.483
Michelle.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.281
She's got a name and everything.

38:14.440 --> 38:15.487
She's got a name.

38:15.640 --> 38:16.687
Well, technically,
she's always had a name.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.649
- Mmm-hmm.
- I mean, her lease was up

38:18.800 --> 38:21.605
and I was with this Craigslist guy,
and he started stealing my socks.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.841
And so, it just made sense.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.650
- It makes sense.
- And we're excited.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.882
Mmm-hmm. We are. You said "we." Okay.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.041
So...

38:28.280 --> 38:30.009
So let me give you the tour.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.326
Um, this is the kitchen.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.084
This is the dining room.

38:33.240 --> 38:38.280
This is the living room
workspace-bedroom region.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.283
And are you working on your Spanish?

38:41.480 --> 38:44.211
Oh, that's been that way since I moved in,
and I don't know how to fix it.

38:44.360 --> 38:47.884
And now I don't know what the world
would be like if it wasn't in Spanish.

38:52.320 --> 38:53.765
It's pretty easy, you know, it's...

39:01.680 --> 39:02.806
Alice.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.886
You're so handy.

39:07.640 --> 39:08.641
Alice.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.802
Michelle is a really lucky girl.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.728
I didn't expect for this to happen.

39:16.720 --> 39:17.721
I just...

39:19.760 --> 39:24.846
I stopped comparing everyone to you
and then I met someone pretty great.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.050
I'm super happy for you.

39:29.320 --> 39:30.446
Yeah, I can see that.

39:31.960 --> 39:35.043
Alice. All right.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.445
I'm gonna go.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.641
Okay.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.129
You need to move on.

39:57.320 --> 39:58.481
Fine.

39:59.480 --> 40:03.201
Uh, no going backwards, only forwards.
You can't sleep with Tom again.

40:03.440 --> 40:07.169
Well, then, we're gonna have to start
going to a different bar, girlfriend.

40:07.320 --> 40:11.245
No, you'll be fine,
just don't hit your drink number with him.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.529
What's my drink number?

40:13.720 --> 40:17.644
In every male-female friendship,
there's a total number of drinks

40:17.800 --> 40:20.371
and if you hit that,
it means you will definitely have sex.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.449
So, how many drinks does it take
to get you wasted?

40:22.600 --> 40:23.601
Two and a half

40:23.760 --> 40:25.842
- but maybe three, if I've eaten.
- Three.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.684
Okay, and Tom's is eight.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.651
So, you can't hit eleven drinks
between the two of you.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.723
- Okay.
- Not one for you, 10 for him.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.049
Not six for him, five for you.

40:35.280 --> 40:37.806
If I had more than five drinks,
I'd hook up with you.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.530
My drink number is 27.

40:39.680 --> 40:40.681
What?

40:40.880 --> 40:43.121
I wouldn't even touch myself
on less than 24.

40:43.320 --> 40:44.367
That's...

40:45.440 --> 40:47.283
What are you doing? Stop.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.169
- What is that?
- Stop.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.087
Oh, my God.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.241
I thought that was gonna be boiling hot.

40:54.440 --> 40:55.521
It's actually really cold.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.721
You have LTRP.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.042
- Oh, my God. I do?
- Yeah.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.929
Tom gave it to me. For sure.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.320
Wait. What's LTRP?

41:02.520 --> 41:03.806
Long-Term Relationship Pussy.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.689
You really need to get that taken care of.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.729
What do you mean? I barely have any hair.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.850
It's like you dropped your hairbrush
and your vagina caught it.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.401
I could make dreadlocks with that bush
and form a reggae band.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.041
That looks like a whole bowl
of petrified curly fries.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.721
It's like Gandalf is staring right at me.

41:19.360 --> 41:22.045
"No penis shall pass!"

41:22.200 --> 41:24.407
You've ruined so many things for me.

41:42.960 --> 41:43.961
Hi.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.884
Hi. What are you here for?

41:46.520 --> 41:51.048
Um, I am here to
finally put myself out there.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.249
Like, in a real way. You know?

41:54.400 --> 41:57.244
Not just physically,
but, like, emotionally.

41:57.400 --> 41:58.401
Yeah.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.365
No, I was asking
what event are you here for?

42:01.640 --> 42:03.051
Oh, um...

42:03.680 --> 42:04.727
Oh, my God.

42:05.160 --> 42:07.049
The Wesleyan Alumni Networking Event.

42:07.200 --> 42:08.247
Cool.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.161
Oh, I'm sorry.

42:20.360 --> 42:21.407
Sorry, sorry.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.444
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

42:23.640 --> 42:24.641
Oh, my God, we're...

42:44.560 --> 42:47.086
Hey. Get back over there,
you're screwing up the harmonies.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.725
- I'm David Stone, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

42:50.920 --> 42:52.046
Hey, I'm Alice.

42:52.360 --> 42:53.361
Alice...

42:53.600 --> 42:54.840
- Kepley.
- Kepley.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.650
It's not as good as Stone.

42:57.120 --> 42:58.485
Do you want one of my business cards?

42:58.680 --> 43:01.365
Or maybe 400 of them,
so you could tile your bathroom?

43:01.520 --> 43:02.521
Well, what's on them?

43:02.720 --> 43:07.486
Um, my Social Security Number,
my mom's maiden name, my ATM PIN.

43:07.640 --> 43:08.641
That's what goes on these, right?

43:08.840 --> 43:10.683
Absolutely, the essentials.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.041
What do you do?

43:12.440 --> 43:13.601
Um, I'm a paralegal.

43:13.760 --> 43:14.761
Okay.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.331
At Brown, Light and Finkelstein.

43:16.480 --> 43:18.960
- Is that 144 Wall Street?
- Yeah.

43:19.120 --> 43:20.565
Yeah, I have the building right next door.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.171
You "have" the building?

43:22.320 --> 43:24.846
Like, in a Fantasy Building League?

43:25.000 --> 43:27.128
No. Um, I don't "have" the building,

43:27.280 --> 43:28.805
- I kind of own it.
- Oh.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.331
There's no way to make that sound right.

43:30.480 --> 43:32.323
I'm a developer, so, it's not just me.

43:32.480 --> 43:33.845
It's like a group of people, but...

43:34.000 --> 43:35.570
That's like a real-ass job, man.

43:35.720 --> 43:37.210
Yeah, I know, it's the worst.

43:39.720 --> 43:40.721
Oh, your team.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.365
We really need to work on our repertoire.

43:42.520 --> 43:44.648
- Are you kidding me? This is my jam!
- Is it?

43:44.800 --> 43:48.646
Yeah, this is like my top 13th
favorite song of all time.

43:51.440 --> 43:52.805
I'm sorry, it's my daughter.

43:52.960 --> 43:54.405
Oh, yeah, no, totally. Me, too.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.961
I mean, I'm a... I'm... A daughter.

43:57.120 --> 43:58.690
It was great to meet you.

43:58.840 --> 44:00.365
Bye. Yeah.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.770
Okay, 30 more seconds.

44:09.640 --> 44:10.641
Twenty-seven.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.760
It said three to 10 minutes,
is that right?

44:14.440 --> 44:15.851
I'm doing this in solidarity.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.685
Guys. Mine's positive.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.171
- What?
- What?

44:21.880 --> 44:22.881
Wait.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.521
I'm taking a drug test.
Is that what you guys are doing?

44:25.960 --> 44:27.166
- No.
- No.

44:35.880 --> 44:36.881
I'm...

44:37.040 --> 44:38.201
You're pregnant.

44:38.440 --> 44:39.441
I'm pregnant.

44:39.640 --> 44:41.051
It's all right, don't worry.

44:41.440 --> 44:42.646
We'll take care of it.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.807
I mean, "Yes!"

44:45.960 --> 44:47.405
You're pregnant!

44:48.160 --> 44:49.491
We're pregnant!

44:49.640 --> 44:50.880
I'm not pregnant!

44:51.080 --> 44:52.605
I'm on drugs!

45:17.080 --> 45:19.731
I found my peanut! This is Paul.

45:19.880 --> 45:20.881
Hey.

45:21.040 --> 45:22.166
He has so many teeth.

45:30.560 --> 45:34.281
What up, office fools?
It's time for Secret Santa!

45:34.800 --> 45:39.085
Who's ready to reach into my cleave
of wonders and win themselves a prize?

45:39.240 --> 45:41.686
Doris, I'm coming to you first, baby.

45:44.280 --> 45:46.851
Whoa! It is a hole-puncher!

45:47.680 --> 45:50.206
You have won Kathy's credit card.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.441
Let's go, dance circle!

45:51.640 --> 45:54.211
Bridget, come on in here, you slut!

45:57.080 --> 46:00.129
How many sliders does it take
to equal a whole burger?

46:01.040 --> 46:02.121
What?

46:02.600 --> 46:05.365
How many little burgers
does it take to make a whole burger?

46:05.520 --> 46:07.682
You're crazy.

46:07.840 --> 46:08.966
Don't call me crazy.

46:09.160 --> 46:11.288
Don't ever call a pregnant woman crazy.

46:11.440 --> 46:12.965
- Okay. All right.
- Not ever. Never.

46:13.160 --> 46:14.161
Okay.

46:14.320 --> 46:16.243
How many little meats
make up a whole big meat?

46:16.520 --> 46:18.329
I don't know, maybe four?

46:20.360 --> 46:21.407
I've had seven.

46:21.560 --> 46:22.891
Eight. I meant eight.

46:23.040 --> 46:24.246
Is it four, or is it eight?

46:24.400 --> 46:26.721
It's eight, or more. Everyone knows that.

46:26.880 --> 46:27.881
Who told you that?

46:28.040 --> 46:29.201
The slider guy.

46:31.400 --> 46:33.323
Please blink, so I know you're in there.

46:34.160 --> 46:35.286
- I'm sorry.
- God.

46:35.480 --> 46:39.201
I just have blood pumping through my body
in an uncomfortable way

46:39.400 --> 46:41.971
and it feels like
it's all accumulating right here.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.327
Don't touch yourself like that
in my workplace.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.482
- I need a man.
- A man?

46:46.640 --> 46:48.483
I don't know...
I don't know what's happening.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.085
It's, like, the hormones or something.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.327
Actually...

46:52.480 --> 46:54.926
The new guy
has sort of been checking you out.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.287
- Which one?
- He's...

47:01.040 --> 47:02.041
- Did you get it?
- No.

47:02.200 --> 47:04.009
All right. He's like...

47:05.840 --> 47:07.205
Right over there.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.644
- No. No.
- Why?

47:11.800 --> 47:13.689
Because he's too young.

47:13.840 --> 47:15.842
All young guys want to do
is have sex all day.

47:16.000 --> 47:21.211
All I need is just a quick 10 minutes,
and then a really long nap.

47:22.400 --> 47:23.970
How old is that little niblet, anyway?

47:24.200 --> 47:27.170
Like, twenty-seven?

47:27.600 --> 47:29.250
The only reason a guy like that
would ever talk to me

47:29.400 --> 47:31.289
is to get a prescription
for medical marijuana.

47:31.440 --> 47:32.441
So, no.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.762
I think he's coming over.
Yeah, he's totally wanting it.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.445
Wait, he might be going to the food.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.648
Don't look over there. No, he's coming.

47:39.600 --> 47:40.601
He's here.

47:41.440 --> 47:42.771
Just saw you looking at me over there.

47:42.960 --> 47:45.804
I thought I'd come over, say "What's up."

47:46.200 --> 47:47.247
- Hmm.
- Or...

47:49.440 --> 47:50.726
Oh, my God, did I misread that?

47:50.880 --> 47:52.848
Were you not...
Were you just talking about...

47:53.000 --> 47:54.923
Um, did you not want me to come over?

47:59.160 --> 48:00.366
Hey, I'm Ken.

48:00.920 --> 48:03.321
- Hmm.
- You must be Alice's sister.

48:03.560 --> 48:04.561
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

48:04.720 --> 48:08.281
- Can I get you...
- I had a lot of drinks earlier today.

48:09.960 --> 48:11.724
Have you heard anything
about an after-party?

48:11.880 --> 48:14.201
Or even, like, another part of this party?

48:14.360 --> 48:18.206
Because this feels like
a longer day at work, than...

48:18.840 --> 48:19.921
Oh, my God, am I boring you?

48:20.120 --> 48:21.804
Is that... Are you trying not to yawn?

48:22.040 --> 48:23.804
- Mmm-mmm.
- That's just your face?

48:24.000 --> 48:27.402
No, I'm sorry.
I'm a doctor, and I'm just really tired.

48:27.560 --> 48:29.005
What is it you were saying you do?

48:29.680 --> 48:32.923
I wasn't, but I work here, for now.

48:33.160 --> 48:34.161
But, um...

48:34.640 --> 48:37.211
Oh, my God, are you having a stroke?

48:37.360 --> 48:38.771
Seriously, this is the honeymoon.

48:38.920 --> 48:40.365
Like, we just met 30 seconds ago.

48:40.880 --> 48:42.803
Honestly, like, if we're not
gonna make it through this,

48:42.960 --> 48:44.610
I don't think we're gonna make it at all.

48:44.760 --> 48:46.967
So, why don't you just, like, let her rip?

48:47.120 --> 48:48.849
- Okay.
- Like, let it all out.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.411
Yeah.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.529
How awesome was that?

48:53.680 --> 48:54.761
That feels so good.

48:54.920 --> 48:56.524
Right?

48:57.000 --> 48:58.411
Who are you, again?

48:58.800 --> 48:59.847
I'm, uh, Ken.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.644
And what's going on here?

49:01.840 --> 49:02.841
- Is this...
- I don't...

49:03.040 --> 49:04.724
Is this one of those fetish things?

49:04.920 --> 49:08.003
Where you're, like, a foot fetish.
Am I the foot?

49:08.480 --> 49:10.482
Do you want to be the foot?

49:10.640 --> 49:14.247
I'm not into feet,
but I would like to go out with you.

49:14.400 --> 49:15.447
Oh.

49:15.680 --> 49:16.806
- Yes.
- Why?

49:17.400 --> 49:19.243
Really? I... Do you not want me to?

49:19.400 --> 49:21.528
I do! I... That's not what I was saying.

49:21.680 --> 49:22.886
No, I was just wondering why.

49:23.040 --> 49:24.929
Because I think you're hot.

49:25.080 --> 49:27.048
And I think you're funny.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.641
And I like the face you make
when you're trying not to yawn.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.121
And then you have an awesome yawn
after that, so...

49:32.320 --> 49:34.368
I mean, that's always something
I've looked for in a girl.

49:34.520 --> 49:35.601
I don't know.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.081
But, cheers.

49:37.560 --> 49:40.404
Holy shit, that's a candle.

49:41.040 --> 49:43.122
So, do you wanna just go do this, then?

49:55.720 --> 49:57.085
I don't want anything serious.

49:57.240 --> 49:59.163
Good, because I'm saving
myself for marriage.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.204
I'm just kidding.

50:01.800 --> 50:03.848
My God, your body is awesome!

50:05.240 --> 50:06.571
Do I smell like hamburgers?

50:06.880 --> 50:08.609
You taste like hamburgers.

50:10.960 --> 50:12.166
That's totally beautiful.

50:16.320 --> 50:18.448
You didn't really have to come
all the way here with me, you know?

50:18.600 --> 50:20.807
And miss a subway ride with you?

50:20.960 --> 50:22.769
That's like 20 extra minutes of Paul time.

50:22.920 --> 50:24.649
Aw. Thank you. Yeah.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.484
Actually, I got you something.

50:26.640 --> 50:27.641
Oh, okay.

50:27.800 --> 50:29.882
I have a sandwich for the train ride.

50:30.040 --> 50:31.405
Oh, thank you.

50:31.560 --> 50:34.450
And there's a bagel in there, too,
in case you don't want the sandwich.

50:34.600 --> 50:37.080
It's a 45-minute train ride,
but thank you.

50:37.720 --> 50:38.881
- And there's this.
- What?

50:39.040 --> 50:40.041
Merry Christmas.

50:40.200 --> 50:41.531
You shouldn't have.

50:41.720 --> 50:43.484
- Really, it's just a little thing that...
- Oh.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.523
Open it now, yeah.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.928
Whoa! These are pictures of us.

50:49.080 --> 50:51.401
It's memories of all our time together.

50:51.680 --> 50:55.002
Yeah, there's three weeks
of photos. That's...

50:55.160 --> 50:56.924
And then we can fill in the rest.

50:58.320 --> 50:59.810
Oh. So...

51:00.200 --> 51:04.330
Look, Lucy, I really care about you.

51:04.800 --> 51:07.804
And I just don't know if we want to think

51:08.000 --> 51:09.604
too much in the long term,

51:09.760 --> 51:12.650
only because I don't know
if I see a future with you.

51:13.200 --> 51:16.204
Normally, I break up with people
before the holidays.

51:16.360 --> 51:18.488
Just so, you know,
they don't get the wrong idea.

51:18.640 --> 51:21.007
But I just thought,
since we're dating other people...

51:21.160 --> 51:24.289
I would just wait and break up with you
on Martin Luther King Day.

51:25.240 --> 51:27.641
Okay, I have no idea what that means,
but it sounds vaguely racist.

51:27.800 --> 51:29.802
Just, statistically,
it's the easiest holiday

51:29.960 --> 51:31.530
to break up with someone on, you know?

51:31.680 --> 51:35.571
I mean, there's no family obligations,
you can get out before Valentine's Day.

51:35.720 --> 51:38.690
I'm sorry, did you just say
you're seeing other people?

51:38.880 --> 51:39.927
Yeah.

51:40.120 --> 51:42.327
I mean, isn't that the whole
point of online dating?

51:42.680 --> 51:43.841
No.

51:44.120 --> 51:46.361
It's to find your soul mate!

51:48.600 --> 51:53.049
I, uh, think maybe we should
only see other people.

51:54.120 --> 51:55.849
Okay. Great talk.

51:57.640 --> 51:58.641
Bye.

52:00.440 --> 52:01.487
Just...

52:01.840 --> 52:03.683
Uh, merry Christmas.

52:07.400 --> 52:11.724
"'We're safe!' said Paul,
as they ran from the dragon."

52:12.240 --> 52:13.571
Um, who's Paul?

52:14.600 --> 52:16.967
Sorry, "the Prince."

52:17.800 --> 52:22.931
"Then, he leaned in to kiss her,
and finally said..."

52:27.760 --> 52:29.091
Oh, that's rich.

52:29.240 --> 52:30.446
How does the story end?

52:30.720 --> 52:32.085
I'll tell you how it ends.

52:32.520 --> 52:34.921
He kisses her, and she wakes up

52:35.080 --> 52:37.401
and finally feels loved

52:37.920 --> 52:40.048
and understood, and wanted.

52:40.360 --> 52:43.284
But then, her friend sees him
dining with the peach lady

52:43.440 --> 52:46.250
and before she knows it,
she's kicked out of the castle.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.684
"The peach lady"?

52:48.840 --> 52:50.444
You bet your sweet ass "the peach lady."

52:50.840 --> 52:55.402
And now, you know,
she's fixating on all her mistakes

52:55.560 --> 52:58.689
and all the money she spent on makeup

52:58.840 --> 53:01.810
and blow-outs, and the heels!

53:01.960 --> 53:04.361
The heels! Walking around on these.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.325
And I'm not supposed
to have any hair here.

53:07.480 --> 53:10.131
No hair here, but tons of it here.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.009
I'm supposed to have a ton,
a ton of it here.

53:12.160 --> 53:13.446
You think this is all real?

53:13.600 --> 53:15.443
- You think that it's all real?
- No.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.761
And Spanx!

53:17.040 --> 53:19.930
Girls. Never wear Spanx.

53:20.080 --> 53:21.605
Because the endgame
is to take them off, anyway

53:21.880 --> 53:24.406
and then the prince
is gonna see all your dumplings

53:24.560 --> 53:27.850
and there ain't nothing less attractive
than trying to squiggle your way

53:28.000 --> 53:30.651
out of what's basically sausage casing.

53:30.800 --> 53:31.881
Look at these links!

53:32.040 --> 53:35.203
You know what, why don't we push pause
on story time for just a second, huh?

53:35.360 --> 53:36.646
Okay, you know what? Sorry.

53:36.800 --> 53:38.245
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, hey. Okay.

53:38.440 --> 53:39.771
- These are kid scissors.
- They don't work.

53:39.920 --> 53:41.968
If your Spanx were made
of construction paper, they would.

53:42.120 --> 53:45.203
And that's how the story ends.

53:45.520 --> 53:48.486
Parents, I'm gonna ask you to sign something
before you leave, if you don't mind.

53:48.640 --> 53:49.641
Story time next week.

53:49.800 --> 53:52.246
Same time, same place, different reader.

53:52.400 --> 53:53.606
Thank you. Okay, now.

53:53.760 --> 53:55.125
Hey, you. Hey. How are you?

53:55.280 --> 53:57.487
Look at me. Hi. Hello. Hi.

53:58.080 --> 53:59.445
Oh, that was terrible.

53:59.600 --> 54:02.285
You scared all the kids,
terrified a lot of parents.

54:02.960 --> 54:06.009
But it was also kind of awesome.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.490
I'm George.

54:11.960 --> 54:13.041
Lucy.

54:16.760 --> 54:17.761
- Hey.
- Hi.

54:17.960 --> 54:19.644
- Hey.
- Hey!

54:19.800 --> 54:21.131
Hey! Oh, thank you.

54:21.320 --> 54:22.481
- For you.
- I'll take that.

54:22.640 --> 54:24.130
- Oh, no.
- That's Robin's.

54:24.320 --> 54:26.561
Yeah. I like to keep this on my own rack.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.360
Sorry, we're late.

54:28.520 --> 54:30.522
No, it's okay.
I'm glad you guys could come.

54:30.680 --> 54:34.241
I know it's tough to be single
around this time of year, so...

54:34.640 --> 54:35.880
Why do people always say that?

54:36.080 --> 54:38.242
The holidays is the best time
to be single.

54:38.640 --> 54:40.881
Parties every night, free-flowing booze.

54:41.040 --> 54:43.486
Santa's beard tickling your inner thigh.

54:43.720 --> 54:45.051
- What?
- Night.

54:45.200 --> 54:46.770
Yeah, take your jacket...

54:46.920 --> 54:48.046
Here, you want me to get your...

54:48.200 --> 54:49.201
Thanks for having us.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.921
Yeah, sure.
I know it's been tough for you.

54:53.200 --> 54:54.770
- For me?
- Yeah.

54:54.920 --> 54:56.331
No, I'm good.

54:56.800 --> 55:00.043
It's really cool of your girlfriend
to be okay with me coming tonight.

55:00.200 --> 55:02.202
Yeah. Yeah, I know, she's really mature.

55:02.600 --> 55:05.444
And, um, also, I told her
you're my cousin.

55:05.600 --> 55:07.728
- Hi, baby.
- Hey. Hi.

55:07.880 --> 55:10.087
Oh, you must be Alice.

55:10.280 --> 55:12.044
- Hi!
- Hi.

55:18.560 --> 55:19.721
Oh, Meg!

55:20.080 --> 55:21.081
- Hi.
- Hey.

55:21.240 --> 55:22.480
Hi, what are you doing here?

55:22.640 --> 55:23.641
I brought you hot chocolate.

55:23.840 --> 55:25.922
- For what?
- For drinking.

55:26.080 --> 55:27.844
Oh, I have to be back
at work in eight minutes.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.047
Perfect.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.406
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

55:30.560 --> 55:32.289
That was nice. Hi.

55:32.960 --> 55:34.121
It's good to see you. You look good.

55:34.280 --> 55:35.691
Oh, oh, there's bourbon in there.

55:35.840 --> 55:37.001
Also, was that a real-life spit take?

55:37.160 --> 55:39.162
- Mmm-hmm.
- I've never seen one in real life.

55:39.320 --> 55:40.845
I just sort of thought it would be like...

55:43.360 --> 55:44.566
- Wow!
- You know?

55:44.720 --> 55:45.721
Yeah.

55:46.200 --> 55:47.406
That was good, yeah.

55:47.560 --> 55:51.360
I can't drink alcohol right now
because I'm about to deliver a baby.

55:51.960 --> 55:53.450
It's so cool you're a doctor.

55:54.440 --> 55:56.761
- It's so cool that you're...
- A receptionist.

55:57.080 --> 56:01.404
Oh, okay. So, what's the male
version of a receptionist?

56:01.560 --> 56:03.244
- Receptionist.
- Oh.

56:03.560 --> 56:04.971
I just love the thrill of it, you know?

56:05.120 --> 56:07.885
Like, "Hello? Hold, please.
Hello? I'll see if she's available."

56:08.040 --> 56:09.849
But I'm thinking about quitting.
I don't know.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.367
It's starting to feel
like the restaurant I worked at.

56:12.520 --> 56:16.605
Oh, shit. Christmas trees.

56:17.080 --> 56:18.161
Come on, we'll get one.

56:18.320 --> 56:21.164
Okay. I mean,
I don't get Christmas trees, but...

56:21.320 --> 56:22.321
Oh, are you Jewish?

56:22.520 --> 56:24.249
No, I just don't get Christmas trees.

56:24.440 --> 56:25.851
Oh, so, you're a monster.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.129
No, I'm just never home,
and I would definitely kill it.

56:29.320 --> 56:30.367
No.

56:30.520 --> 56:34.445
And then those needles fall into the rug
and stab your feet when you walk on them.

56:34.600 --> 56:35.601
Okay.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.128
All right. Look at this guy, right?

56:38.400 --> 56:40.164
That's the John McClane
of Christmas trees.

56:40.320 --> 56:42.004
Like, you cannot kill this guy.

56:42.160 --> 56:44.049
We load him up with a bunch of water,

56:44.200 --> 56:46.771
stuff one of those self-pouring
cat bottles on the side

56:46.960 --> 56:48.291
you're good to go for, like, three weeks.

56:48.440 --> 56:50.044
I'm telling you,
you're gonna be begging this guy to die.

56:50.200 --> 56:51.486
- Yeah.
- Then, in three weeks

56:51.840 --> 56:55.322
we throw this guy out on the street,
and get ready for Valentine's Day.

56:55.520 --> 56:56.851
"We" get ready for Valentine's Day?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.162
- Yeah, hearts, candy, you name it.
- Oh.

56:59.320 --> 57:01.800
No, no, no, no. That's not...

57:02.080 --> 57:04.560
Listen, in three weeks from now...

57:04.720 --> 57:08.088
I think the novelty of this whole thing
will have worn off

57:08.240 --> 57:10.766
and I think, the reality will set in,

57:10.920 --> 57:14.447
which is that I work all the time
and I probably would never see you,

57:14.600 --> 57:17.570
and I'd probably
have to cancel all of our dates.

57:17.760 --> 57:22.369
And, when I did finally see you, I would
probably just fall asleep on your face.

57:22.560 --> 57:23.561
- Oh...
- Yeah, and then,

57:23.760 --> 57:25.808
you would go off,
and meet some girl at the gym.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.651
Because you obviously have
a lot of time to spend at the gym

57:28.840 --> 57:31.963
and so would she, and I don't even know
why we're having this conversation.

57:32.120 --> 57:33.963
I mean, you are obviously not a real thing

57:34.120 --> 57:36.851
and I feel like we're wasting air
even talking about it.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.162
And I have hip problems,
real hip problems.

57:39.320 --> 57:43.848
And not from doing fun things,
like having sex, but from gravity.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.729
And what we had was great.

57:45.880 --> 57:49.521
Thank you for helping me out with that.

57:49.680 --> 57:50.681
That was fun.

57:51.120 --> 57:53.885
But you will find a girl your own age

57:54.040 --> 57:57.044
and then you can do fun things
like look for trees and whatever.

57:57.240 --> 58:00.244
But that's not what's happening here,
between you and me, so...

58:00.400 --> 58:01.526
Just so you know.

58:01.680 --> 58:03.091
I have to get back to work now.

58:05.720 --> 58:06.721
My God.

58:06.920 --> 58:08.968
Fine, we won't get a Christmas tree!

58:34.480 --> 58:35.481
Hey, Robin.

58:35.840 --> 58:36.841
Yeah.

58:39.640 --> 58:40.641
Yes?

58:40.840 --> 58:42.968
Do you want to go see
the Rockefeller tree?

58:43.160 --> 58:44.400
- Right now?
- Yeah.

58:44.560 --> 58:47.803
No, Buzz-Cut and Dimples
are visiting from Italy

58:48.000 --> 58:50.082
and they want to know all about
American Christmas traditions

58:50.240 --> 58:51.924
like us sitting on their faces.

58:52.560 --> 58:54.847
- No. No.
- Come on, it's Christmas!

58:55.000 --> 58:57.002
I'm not gonna do that tonight.

58:57.160 --> 58:59.242
Why? Their dicks
probably look like cannolis.

58:59.440 --> 59:02.125
No, it's okay. I'll call you tomorrow.

59:09.800 --> 59:12.167
It's plastic. You can't kill it.

59:45.080 --> 59:46.161
Hey.

59:47.080 --> 59:48.081
Hey.

59:49.280 --> 59:50.850
I feel like I know you.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.729
God, I wish I had
one of your business cards,

59:53.880 --> 59:55.006
so I could remember who you are.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.926
Yeah, you're the, um, fancy, married guy,
with the kid and the buildings.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.761
Uh... I'm not married.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.610
Um, I do have a daughter.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:06.841
Oh.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.567
- And I'm fancy.
- Yeah.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.684
You're wearing a scarf
on the outside of your jacket.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.569
Which... That serves zero purpose.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.041
Um...

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:23.329
This is super random, but do you want
to go see the Rockefeller tree with me?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.206
No? That's a big "no."

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.361
No, no.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.563
I know it's probably like so crowded
with so many tourists,

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.846
I don't know why I even want to do that.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.163
I just... I was just thinking,
I want to show you something.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.801
Okay.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.282
All right. This door.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.201
Aye.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.164
You know what? I am just realizing now
that I've gone with a complete stranger,

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.609
to an abandoned location
covered in plastic...

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.804
So, if you're gonna Dexter me...

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.081
You know what? Honestly?

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.891
Dying would not be the worst
thing in the world, right now.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.485
- What is happening?
- All right. Close your eyes.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.688
Okay. Here we go. Bye!

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.810
- What is that sound?
- Just one second.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.724
The world's largest shower curtain?

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.611
What is it? What's happening?

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.966
One sec.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.526
Is that the body bag?

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.681
Is that duct tape?

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.611
Is it "duck" tape or is it "duct" tape?

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.481
Open your eyes.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.565
Oh, my God.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.163
This is amazing.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.686
Thank you.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.771
I've always wanted to see this.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.921
Yeah.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.210
I don't know why I always talk myself out
of doing the things I really want to do.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:53.361
Like what?

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.081
There's this thing
that people do on New Year's,

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.971
where they hike
the Grand Canyon in the dark,

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.329
so that they can watch the New Year
come in with the dawn.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.448
That sounds amazing.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.931
- I know.
- Yeah.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.287
I'm just not a hiker.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.845
I don't like that stuff that's on
the ground, that, like, gets on you.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.451
- The dirt?
- Yes.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.410
But, um, I don't know.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.490
Maybe we can, um, do
something else this year.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.804
- "We"?
- Did I say "we"?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.604
This one's name is Ping-Ping.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.886
Ping-Ping?

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.041
It's nice to meet you.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.282
- Who's this guy?
- Lion.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.967
Lion is very handsome and,
also, we seem to be matching.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.207
Well, what about this guy?

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.407
Zebra-Zebra.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.763
Hmm. I was told never to
trust a man with two first names.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.806
What about, do you want to tell me
the names of these ones?

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.526
This is LA. I'll be two seconds.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.250
Okay, we're fine.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.048
Do you know the Eyes of You song?

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.406
The what song?

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.085
Eyes of You song.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.924
No, I don't know what that is.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.410
Oh, I know that song.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.006
What are you doing?

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.084
Well, we were working
on our pop star careers,

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.203
but her voice is way better than mine.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.441
Can I talk to you?

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.011
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.566
Uh, what are you doing?

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.006
What do you mean?

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.525
You're not her mom.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.409
What are you... What are you...

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.846
What do you mean?

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.042
We were just singing, David.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.044
Look, I'm sorry,
but when it comes to Phoebe

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.806
I get very protective.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.811
And, you can't just...

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.121
Look, I'm really sorry.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.970
I didn't know that that was a thing.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.842
I'm not trying to, like...

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.725
I guess I didn't know that
that would upset you

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.805
because you don't actually ever really
share anything with me.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.887
Do you know how I found out
your wife passed away?

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.045
From your doorman, David.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.281
Yeah, well.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.801
I just thought you were divorced.
I had no idea.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.487
It's just been two years, okay?
Phoebe's not ready for all that.

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.486
I have no idea
what it's like to be a parent.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.890
But, I feel like you have to
open up to Phoebe about her mom...

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.326
Look, Alice.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.881
I can't do this.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.606
I'm sorry.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.250
I know I'm not
supposed to need you anymore, but...

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.566
I really do.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.881
Come here.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.206
I feel like I don't even know
who I am anymore.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.411
It's okay.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.769
I have to warn you,
I have this weird farting thing happening.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.571
I don't know if it's me, or the baby
farting through me, or what, but...

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.886
Let me see.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.848
Hi, you stinky little baby.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.367
You know you're not gonna
be able to hide this for much longer.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.924
You need to tell him.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.805
I love you, monkey.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.525
I love you.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.968
Hey, Happy Alcoholic's Day.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.408
All right, let me guess.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.642
You're one of those parade-hating
buzzkills that stays at home,

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.121
while the rest of us are out here,
celebrating Saint Patrick's Day.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.169
No. You know what? I'm into it.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.409
George is an eighth Irish.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.329
Do you think he'll like it? Look, I did...

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.606
Yeah.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.841
Who's George?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.331
Luce. Hey!

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.286
Oh, there he is!

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.529
That's George?

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.009
Happy Saint Patrick's Day!

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.686
Yes!

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.011
Mmm.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.444
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.969
- It's been forever.
- Yeah.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:32.930
Are you here with somebody?

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.731
Oh, no. I'm, I'm... I'm alone.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.644
I just thought I'd grab some pancakes

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.689
- 'cause I love pancakes.
- This was our place.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:40.841
Okay.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.764
What are you doing? Who are you here with?

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.921
I'm here with my parents.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.127
- Oh, my God.
- Here they are.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:46.321
- Look who it is.
- Alice!

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:48.720
- Hi! How are you?
- Oh, my God.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.211
We're here to celebrate.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:51.441
- How are you?
- It's so good to see you. Hi.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.841
Josh got into business school.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.121
- What?
- I did.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.361
It just happened. It's crazy.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.010
I didn't even know you wanted to...

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.242
We were just gonna take a picture.
Come on, get in here.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.528
We're just gonna take a picture.
Come on, come on, get in here.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.841
- Squeeze in.
- No, no, no!

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.331
Selfie time! Selfie time. One, two...

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.845
No, I can take one of you guys.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.047
Three!

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.089
You're better than her.

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.321
Wow. What?

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.324
- What?
- Mom! You need to go inside.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:15.926
I know you've said it a million times.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.445
- Take her inside...
- All right. There you go.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.204
- ...and then take her home.
- Great to see you again.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.447
- Great to see you.
- Okay.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.601
Bye, guys.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.808
- It's great to see you.
- It's great to see you.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.961
Yeah.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.288
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.490
Don't squash my pancakes, man.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.802
Oh, sorry. Do you want to...
Yeah, let's...

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.650
- We should hang out soon.
- I'll see you around.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.165
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.166
Bye.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.326
What the fuck?

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.040
Are you pregnant?

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.361
What?

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.890
I've been trying to have a baby. Yes.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.203
I... It's probably
not even going to stick.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.210
Yeah, I think it stuck.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.727
Okay, I don't know what that tone was

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.488
but, if you haven't noticed,
my boobs have gotten much bigger.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.165
Yeah, of course I noticed
your boobs getting bigger.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.250
I put that on my vision board, okay?
I thought that was because of me.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.561
Who does that?

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.722
I do! People like me, visionaries!

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.530
Didn't you notice that I was getting fat?

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.331
That's a trick question.
You are not getting fat.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.403
You are beautiful,
you have always been beautiful,

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.085
and you are carrying this so well.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.241
You think?

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.084
Is this why you've been
avoiding me lately?

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.007
Oh, my God. I think I'm gonna...

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.527
- I'm gonna be a dad!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:13.926
Sorry, we're gonna have a baby!

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.082
We're gonna be... Not "dads."
We're gonna...

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.730
No, it's not.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.008
Like, you're not... It's not...

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.441
Is that not mine?

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.081
I'm just pregnant.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.447
What do you mean, you're "just pregnant"?
That's crazy. How's that possible?

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.965
- What?
- I said, you're being crazy.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.691
You've lied to me the entire time
we've been together about being pregnant

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.649
and now you're upset with me
because I believed it?

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.290
That's what a crazy person does.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.680
That's three times.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.121
Say it again.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.282
I don't know. It just seems crazy to me.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.124
I just want to tell you something.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.286
Usually, it's a good idea
not to call a pregnant woman crazy.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.806
You know what I mean?

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.371
She's nuts, everybody.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.681
So funny!

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.600
Oh, my God!

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:57.761
Not funny!

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.967
Get it, girl.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.811
Who is the father?

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:07.402
I don't know! I don't know.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.449
- How do you not know?
- Stop yelling at me.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.601
How could you not know
something like that?

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.761
Did you not catch his name?

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.809
I did I.V.F. with a sperm donor. Okay?

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.928
- Oh, my God.
- Do you have a problem with that?

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.451
I don't have a problem with that.
It's your body.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.490
Do whatever you want with your body.
Cover it in tattoos. I don't care.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.324
I think I deserve to know
when there's someone

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.244
living inside the person
I'm having sex with.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.289
Don't say that. That's gross!

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.488
There is nothing gross about that.
It is beautiful!

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.642
- It's not your problem.
- Not genetically, okay?

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.127
But my girlfriend is having a baby.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.006
Babe, if we're gonna
make this thing work, like,

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.844
this is the kind of thing I need to know.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.731
What are you gonna do?
Stay home and take care of a baby?

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.129
Did I just win the lottery?

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.328
Yes, I want to stay home
and take care of a baby.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.768
When I was eight years old, my Halloween
costume was a stay-at-home Dad.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.371
You're saying I never
have to go to work again.

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:51.851
I get to hang out with a baby all day?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.001
Just stop saying the word "baby."

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.003
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby!
Because babies are awesome!

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.449
Okay, listen.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.683
You and I, we probably would
have a lot of fun together

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.363
and then, one day, we would be
on this road trip together.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.682
And I would be driving,
and then I'd get tired

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:14.124
and I would hate to do it,
but I would agree to let you drive.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.409
And then, I would feel very safe,
and that's when we would crash.

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.725
You think you can control everything,
but you can't.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.370
That's not how this works.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.647
If I could choose someone
to do this with, it would be you.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.165
You can choose!

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.887
I just... I'm not the only one
in the car, anymore.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.206
Yeah.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.085
Well, for the record,
this is not me leaving.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.048
This is you pushing me away.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.964
- Daddy?
- Yeah, babe?

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.327
I want the Eyes of You song.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.084
Sing it to me.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.407
Not tonight, sweetheart. Okay?

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.881
Get some sleep.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.527
It's just, Josh and I
could be married by now

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.007
and we would have, like,
the cutest little baby daughter

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.801
and she would probably
be named after a fruit.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.406
What kind of name is George,
anyway? Right?

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.846
I hate his hair.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:37.011
Actually, technically,
we would have a four-year-old daughter,

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.686
in which case, her name would be Rihanna.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.968
What? We haven't known
each other four years.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.531
No, not you. Josh.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.681
Oh, right, yeah.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.683
But, exactly.
It's the same thing with me and Lucy.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.049
It's like, if I go to work,
and she's not there,

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.966
I'm like mad or something.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:56.125
Yeah. Which is nuts, because
she's not completely disgusted by you.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:58.647
I don't get it. I don't know where
I'm gonna find another one like her.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.330
Yeah. I don't know, man.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.771
Maybe we've just made all the wrong moves.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.844
Maybe, this whole time,
we've been focusing on all the wrong stuff

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.889
and now it's just too late.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.204
To the wrong stuff.

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.607
This is it. We can't pass "eleven."

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.491
What are you talking about?

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.124
Our drink number.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.721
In every male and female friendship,
there's a number of drinks,

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:27.168
and if you pass it,
you have to have sex, mathematically.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.444
Whatever, dude.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.522
Oi. Sorry. Loud noise.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.409
Where did that come from?

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.927
Uh... The floor.

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.409
One, two, three. That's three.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.801
Four, five, six.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:50.966
Seven.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.924
Eight, nine.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:04.520
It's just ten. It's just ten.

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.484
Eleven. Did you drink this?

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.641
No.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.847
Oh, thank God.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.201
You did.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.723
This may be a mistake.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.609
It's just such a bad idea.

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.206
Yeah, I'm sorry. I was, like, trying to
bone the Lucy out of my system.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.522
Yeah, see, normally,
I feel like I'd be mad at that.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.489
But I just did
the exact same thing to you.

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:39.802
Right, yeah. Shit.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.246
I think I like her.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.646
Like, when we're together...

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.282
I feel like me, but, like... A better me.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:55.489
See, that's the magic.
That's what I got to find.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:56.766
Yeah.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.284
I can let myself out.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.884
Cheers!

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.129
Whoa!

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.807
Alice! Happy Birthday!

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:51.961
Hi!

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.724
Thank you. What is that? Give me that.

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.565
Um, this is actually for Meg.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.290
I had it made for her, specially.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:02.209
Aw. That is so sweet. Look how cozy.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.767
Maybe I'll give it to her. Just, later on.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.967
Hey!

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.326
No Tom, no Josh,

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:13.891
I'm just gonna have a really good time and
I'm not gonna think about any boys at all.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.769
Here's to no drama.

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.526
- No drama.
- Whoo!

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.166
Happy Birthday!

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.241
Whoo!

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.686
Thanks, buddy.

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.765
I'll show you. This way.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.004
Oh, my God.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.407
- Dude, Ricky Stimpkins!
- Josh! What's up, man?

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.324
Wow, I haven't seen you
since college, man!

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.005
I'm just hanging.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.208
I got to go get a drink,
but I'll catch you later.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.408
- Okay, cool. Yeah, man.
- I'm gonna find Alice.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.205
Tall person.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.849
We got a whole "No hats" thing

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.686
but you seem like a good guy,
and, you know...

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.050
Hey. What's up, guys?

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.611
- Hey.
- Hey. Josh.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.281
You're Josh?

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:27.761
What's that supposed to mean?

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.730
No... Nothing. Makes total sense.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.166
Wait, how do you know Alice?

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.521
How do you guys know Alice?

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.170
Oh, fuck me.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:36.401
This is Josh.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:37.841
Makes sense.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.321
What? Are you guys new friends, or...

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.481
Oh, my God.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.401
Come here.

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.689
Um, Tom is here, and David, and Josh.

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.484
And David. Did I say David?

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.404
Yeah, I know, because I invited them.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.607
You're welcome.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.961
Why? Why would you do that?

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.930
Because I thought it would be funny.
For me.

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:04.529
And good for you, emotionally,
to have guys fighting over you.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.160
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.725
- What's going on?
- How are you?

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:15.123
Pretty good. Uh, I need to
talk to you about something.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.322
- Great. Me, too.
- You go first.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.403
- I'm getting married.
- What?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.365
That's, uh...

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.688
Look, your computer programs
are total bullshit.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:30.406
Your algorithms?
Also, total bullshit, all right?

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:33.530
Just because the music stops, doesn't mean
you got to sit in the closest chair.

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.808
You shouldn't be with George.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.086
You should be with me.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.406
- Yes. I want to be with you.
- What?

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.046
God, all those bad dates at the bar,

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.521
there was something that was always there.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.727
You.

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.161
It was always me.

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.089
- Yes. Oh, my God.
- Right?

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.566
We could have the best life together.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.449
And, I mean, we're gonna want
to get married soon

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.728
because we'll probably want to
start a family right away.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.202
Oh, my God. Our kids...
Our kids are gonna be so cute.

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:03.811
Exactly.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:07.567
Which is why we should just
kind of pump the brakes

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.165
and not rush things, you know?

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:12.563
Let's take care of us right now.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.051
Oh, my God, Tom.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.770
I'm totally messing with you.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.764
Thank you. Oh, my God.

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.365
I don't want to be with you.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.409
And you don't want to be with me, either.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.409
- Wait.
- Babe!

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.170
- Oh, my God.
- I saw everything.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.049
I thought you were gonna
hyperventilate, man.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.645
But I didn't!

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.605
Oh, Tom. Come on. Don't be sad.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:32.921
You know what this is?

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.090
This is the first,
tiny green sprout of life

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.363
fighting its way out of
the gravel parking lot of your heart.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.760
So, congrats.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.728
- That was beautiful.
- Thank you, hon.

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.245
Hang on, one second.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.448
Hey, quick, man, just one last thing.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:51.080
Stay the fuck away
from my girl, okay, man?

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.322
Or I will straight-up end you.

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.481
- Okay. All right.
- Okay?

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.801
So, just back off. You got it?

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.325
- Yeah.
- Because I put a ring on that

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.562
and you're coming at it
pretty hard with your dick.

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.649
- Okay.
- I'm fucking with you, man.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.241
- Cool, okay.
- No, of course.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.482
Lucy loves you, I love you.

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:06.966
We're brothers, now, all right?

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.851
And, as such, I would like to...

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.890
This is a big one...

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.964
Ask you to be my best man.

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.561
- Yeah, you got it.
- I'm fucking with you, bro!

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.690
Of course, you can't be my best man.
You are a stranger to me.

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:22.927
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.487
Just to recap...
Stay the fuck away from my girl.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.244
I don't want you to be my best man.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.164
We still love you, you're family.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.560
You'll definitely be
invited to the wedding.

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.370
- Okay.
- But, probably not.

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.806
So, don't be offended.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.445
I'm glad we had this talk, man.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.885
Whoo!

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.321
Uh...

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.925
You trying to hide from me?

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.883
- Are you hiding from me? Hi.
- Huh? Hi.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.202
I didn't see you, right over there.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.401
It's a good hiding spot.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.366
Uh, listen.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.760
I've been thinking about you a lot...

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.729
Look, David, I'm sorry, I...

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:02.881
I can't do this.

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:06.408
You made it so clear to me
that you didn't want to, so...

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.971
That's not why I came here at all.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:12.725
I just came here to apologize to you
for being such an asshole.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:15.201
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:18.486
Well, you were right about Phoebe.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.449
Oh, good. Did you talk to her?

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.206
Well, um, you know, I'm working on it.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.681
But are you okay?

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.531
I'm working on it.

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:37.721
Happy Birthday.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.722
See? I told you this would be fun.

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:57.127
Although, I thought one of them was, like,
gonna punch each other

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.520
and that hasn't happened yet.

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.251
Robin, this isn't a joke. This is my life.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.767
But you know what? I guess
you wouldn't actually understand that

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.288
because you've never really cared
about anybody enough to ever get hurt.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.727
So, this type of thing doesn't affect you.

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.407
Okay. I'm sorry I invited them,
but who gives a shit about me?

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.250
I do, because you're my friend!

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.761
Am I? Because as far as I can tell

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:20.241
you only ever want to hang out with me
when you get dumped

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.851
and you need someone to cheer you up.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.449
Well, you only ever hang out with me
when you need me to be your little sidekick.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:29.406
The reason why I don't hang around
with you when you're in a relationship,

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.804
is because you just turn into this
lame-ass shell of a human being.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.241
Nice.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.448
- Yeah, do you want some real advice?
- Yeah, what?

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.288
You're not gonna find the right guy
by bumming free drinks and slutting it up.

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.965
Where is this coming from?

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.929
This whole time,
you've been the one that's like,

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:48.811
"Oh, yeah, parties and dicks and shots.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.646
"Let's put shots all over our bodies.
More sparkles, bitch!"

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.122
It's about me being sick of you just meeting
guys and falling into their dick-sand.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.406
Falling into their what?

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.403
Their dick-sand.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.801
It's like, every time
a guy just looks at you,

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.689
you just forget who you are, and...

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.041
Like... "Oh!"

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.090
You get sucked into their world.

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.809
At least when I do decide
I want a boyfriend...

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.327
I'm gonna find someone
who likes me for who I really am,

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:17.211
because I know who the fuck that is.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.087
Hey.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.840
Oh, my God.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.648
Happy Birthday.

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.249
It's your birthday!

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.808
And I drank some of your gift.

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:22.806
You okay?

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.364
No. No.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:38.801
God, you look pretty when you're pissed.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.002
I missed these.

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:54.251
- What are we doing?
- We're about to have sex.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.447
What?

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.685
- God.
- What?

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:01.209
So, ever since I saw you,
I feel like we fucked up.

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.010
I shouldn't have let you go.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.288
Because Michelle and I are still together,
and we're actually engaged

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.249
- and I feel like we're fucking up...
- What? What?

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.529
We're getting married,
but I don't know if I want to do it yet.

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.520
- Oh, my God.
- Wait!

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:18.728
- I'm just telling...
- Oh, my God.

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.405
- Oh, my God.
- Come here, come here.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.608
You just let me make out
with somebody else's fiancé.

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.047
No, it's not cheating,
since we've already been together.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.645
- What are you doing?
- Wait, just...

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.046
You told me you missed me!

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.851
I... That's the whole point,
I miss you all the time.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.642
I saw you and you were so beautiful,
and you are so beautiful.

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.243
And I just need closure...

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.481
- I think we need...
- Is that what this...

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.284
- This is closure for you?
- Yeah.

01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.209
Just one last screw for old times' sake

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.966
before you go and settle down
with somebody else?

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.360
That's not...

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:50.842
I'm sorry, all right?

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.681
- Alice.
- No, you know, what?

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.320
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.006
I spent so much time wanting you back

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.726
that, when I thought
that you wanted me back,

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:03.848
it's like I lost my mind for a second.

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.769
Oh, my God. This is it!
This is the dick-sand.

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.928
I'm falling into your dick-sand right now.

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:10.923
- What?
- It's like quicksand, but with dicks.

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.127
I don't have dick-sand.

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:16.808
I'm so obsessed with the idea of
being in love that I just, it's like...

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:19.529
I completely lose myself.

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.242
Like, I forget what I want
and I just disappear.

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.243
I'm like the horse
in The Never ending Story.

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.171
I don't think it's coming out
like it's inside your head.

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.566
Josh. I want to be alone.

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:35.003
I know that I've said that a lot.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.369
But, for the first time in my life,
I really, really, truly mean it.

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.768
Congratulations on your engagement.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.126
Where to?

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.646
Home.

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.245
I'm going home.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.607
Woman! I don't know
where the fuck you live.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.211
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.488
Um, can I go to South Second and Berry?

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.849
Oh, my God!

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.323
Robin? Oh, my God!

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.407
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.085
Take us to the hospital,
and I won't sue you!

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.129
- What's happening?
- We got to go...

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.608
Hey!

01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:47.201
Oh, God!

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.441
Oh, my God, it's happening.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.681
No, no, no.
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:50.841
- Oh, my God!
- No, it's fine!

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.206
I got her, I got her.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.210
The average labor
for a new mom is 26 hours.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:57.084
It doesn't pop out like it does on TV.

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.930
- It's gonna be fine.
- Okay.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.730
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.450
Oh, my God, is it fine?
Is everything fine?

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:03.601
- Get a cab. Get me a cab.
- Okay!

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.921
I've got one!

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.284
Ooh!

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:11.688
Take us to the hospital
and I won't sue you!

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:14.487
This is bad.

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:17.882
- Okay, okay.
- Oh... This is really bad!

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.282
I need to call my patients and say sorry.

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:22.481
No.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.802
This is not natural!

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.961
- Okay.
- God!

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:29.563
You're at 10 centimeters and you've already
entered the second phase of labor,

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:31.563
- known as active labor.
- What?

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.042
I went to medical school.
Is that so hard to believe?

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.201
Yes!

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:37.129
This is gonna happen, like, right now.

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:38.560
Get your foot off my tit.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.085
Get your foot off my tit, okay?

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.930
It's coming. You are the cliché!

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:45.129
You are the lady who's about to
have a baby in the back of a taxi

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:48.170
and I'm the Australian-American hero
who's gonna make it happen!

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.129
- In the cab, though?
- Don't worry, Meg.

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:53.602
My hands and my mouth have both
been recently sterilized by vodka.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.171
- Feels like it's coming out.
- No, no, no, no...

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:56.367
I'm going in. I'm going in.

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.601
- Chant with me!
- Hold it inside!

01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.564
- We can do this.
- Do this.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:01.922
We can do this.

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.491
We can do this, we can do this.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.131
We're here! We're here!

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.361
- Get out. Get out.
- Okay, open the door.

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:09.891
- Shit, the door's...
- Open the door.

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.246
- It won't open!
- Open the door!

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:12.447
- It won't open!
- The door!

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.001
Wait! The window's working.
We just got to...

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.685
- What are you doing?
- The door's locked!

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.201
Just open the door!

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:19.841
It's coming out!

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.811
Robin! Okay, you have to help her!

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.803
You have to help her.
She's gonna help you, okay?

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:25.961
- I can't.
- Help her.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:27.161
Come on!

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.090
Close your legs really tight.

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.605
Do not let it come out!

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.530
Robin, it was locked!

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.845
Come on!

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:40.326
- Oh! My purse.
- No, no, no, no!

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:41.811
- Keep it inside.
- It's coming out!

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:42.961
I need a... We need a wheelchair.

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.360
Jesus. Okay, don't let it come out!

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.851
- It's gonna come out.
- Don't let it come out.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.889
- Wait, Meg. Meg! Meg!
- I need to... I need to push.

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.923
- It's coming out. It's coming out.
- Are you coming?

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.889
You don't need me anymore.

01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:56.526
- Okay.
- Oh, God. Okay.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:58.884
- I'm scared.
- I'm right here.

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.127
Hi.

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:23.046
I called him.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:29.330
Look, I know you don't want me here,
but just listen to me, okay?

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.641
You like me. A lot.

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:34.767
And I like you.

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.642
And you're crazy. That's a fact.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.930
Honestly, I think you're probably
just as crazy when you're not pregnant.

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.443
But I'm allowed to say that,
because I love you.

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.607
I love you.

01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.765
I'm gonna come back later.

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:57.930
Thanks for calling.

01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.286
Don't be weird.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.124
Thank you, thank...

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:04.566
Well, are you gonna come meet her or not?

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.125
- Her?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.650
It's a "her"?

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.688
This is baby Madeline.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.081
Oh, my God, look at you.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.644
Happy Birthday, sweetheart.

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.651
She's beautiful.

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.162
And I think I love you, too.

01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:29.811
I mean, I do love you,
I don't know why I just said that.

01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:31.530
I really love you.

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.047
I really, really love you.

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.645
I mean, I don't...

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.485
I can totally handle
all of this by myself.

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.641
I'm an independent woman.

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:40.926
My God, seriously?

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.725
But I don't want to.

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.481
I don't.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:47.841
Mmm.

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:51.761
- Hi.
- Mmm.

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.130
Doesn't she look like an alien?

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:59.371
You are the most beautiful alien
in the world.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.441
Hi.

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.361
What do you want?

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:07.043
I wanted to tell you that I know
that I can do a lot of things on my own.

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.000
And I can unzip my own dress,
but I want you to do it for me.

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.569
That sounded really weird. Um...

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.323
I want you to watch me unzip my dress.

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.484
No, sorry. That sounded really sexual.
That's not what I meant.

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:22.484
What I meant is
I want to unzip my own dress

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:26.486
and I just want you to be around,
because you're my best friend.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.651
And I love you.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.968
And I'm totally in love with you, too.

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.569
This is more than just a friendship.

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.328
I'm so glad you feel the same way.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.889
Just joking!

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:44.242
- Oh, my God.
- I got you.

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:46.050
Oh, but I do love you.

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.690
- And I missed you.
- Oh.

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:51.010
I've been having
Alice withdrawal, seriously.

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.561
Wait, are you kidding me?
Is this where you live?

01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:00.282
Robin! This is your 500 square feet,

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.727
where you keep your clothes
and occasionally bathe?

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.600
Uh, yeah.

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.769
I'm super rich. Did I not mention that?

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:09.008
Wait. Why do we always
hang out at my place?

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:10.645
Why did you even work at the firm?

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.088
Wait, why do I pay for everything
all the time?

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:16.441
Wow.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:19.410
Well, I didn't really need
to work at the firm.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.723
I just really liked hanging out with you.

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.803
And screwing those two security guys.

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:26.086
Why do you have a scooter?

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.571
This is my indoor scooter.

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.411
I have the whole floor.

01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:32.041
I have literally paid the bill,
every time we've gone out.

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.168
But that's how you stay super rich.

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:35.561
God!

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.131
You have so much to learn from me, still.

01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:38.890
I want you to be my sugar-daddy.

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.724
I'll be your sugar-sister.

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.325
I thought you didn't do breakfast?

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.648
You're ruining it.

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.243
I've been thinking that
the time we have to be single,

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:54.723
is really the time we have
to get good at being alone.

01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.568
But how good at being alone
do we really want to be?

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:04.087
Isn't there a danger
that you'll get so good at being single,

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:07.841
so set in your ways that you'll miss out
on the chance to be with somebody great?

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.240
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.451
Some people take baby steps
to settle down.

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.128
Some people refuse to settle at all.

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:35.168
Sometimes, it's not statistics.

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:38.328
It's just chemistry.

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.286
And sometimes, just because it is over,

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.968
doesn't mean the love ends.

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:51.124
Um... I want to talk to
you about your mom.

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:55.087
She got sick when you were really little

01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:59.643
and I don't talk about her
because I still miss her.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.641
Every day.

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:06.682
But we need to talk about her.

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.846
Who's that?

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.241
Me.

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:11.886
Who's that?

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.004
- Mommy.
- Yeah.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.002
A lot of good memories in here.

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.480
I want to show you something.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.241
The Eyes of You song.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.524
The Eyes of You song.

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.767
Now I know why you never sing.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.326
Why?

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:22.404
Because your voice is so bad.

01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:26.324
What are you talking about?
That was excellent.

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:30.850
The thing about being single is,
you should cherish it.

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.010
Because, in a week,
or a lifetime, of being alone,

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.723
you may only get one moment.

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:48.084
One moment, when you're not tied up
in a relationship with anyone.

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:52.567
A parent, a pet, a sibling, a friend.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:05.085
One moment, when you stand on your own.

01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:11.288
Really, truly single.

01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:21.361
And then...

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:26.565
It's gone.
