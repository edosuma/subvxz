00:33.720 --> 00:35.640
I'm gonna cut
right to it.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.920
Uh, I want to go out
with you next Friday.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.600
Do you want to
go out with me?

00:41.600 --> 00:44.280
Do I have anything
to say about this?

00:44.280 --> 00:47.160
Sure. You could say,
"what time?"

00:47.160 --> 00:49.000
[Miming speech]

00:50.840 --> 00:54.040
I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

[Tucker laughing]

00:56.040 --> 00:58.400
Whoa, big, fella, whoa.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.640
What are
you doing?

01:01.640 --> 01:03.640
Gary's my servant
for a week.

01:03.640 --> 01:04.879
Down, boy.

01:04.879 --> 01:06.600
Why?

01:06.600 --> 01:09.360
We made a deal.
Don't ask.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.040
I found a poem he wrote.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.280
Tucker!

01:13.280 --> 01:14.800
A poem?

01:14.800 --> 01:18.160
I promised not to show it to
anybody if he'd be my servant.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.880
Enough, you little spud.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.240
One more word,
and the deal's off.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.200
No sweat.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.400
Hurry up
and tell your story.

01:27.400 --> 01:32.000
I've got some dirty socks
that you've gotta wash.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.430
OK.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.800
I've got
a special story tonight.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.120
There's an old saying:

01:41.120 --> 01:44.960
What goes around,
comes around.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.880
In my story,
a kid finds out

01:46.880 --> 01:49.880
that no matter what you do,
good or bad,

01:49.880 --> 01:53.040
it always
comes back at you.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.360
It's great
if you do something nice,

01:57.360 --> 02:00.000
but if you do
something rotten,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.440
watch out--
it's coming back,

02:03.440 --> 02:07.240
and probably,
when you least expect it.

02:09.560 --> 02:12.920
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

02:12.920 --> 02:14.480
I call this story...

02:22.400 --> 02:24.320
<i> Mike was a pretty average kid</i>

02:24.320 --> 02:26.120
<i> who worked a paper route.</i>

02:26.120 --> 02:27.320
<i> It was the day before</i>

02:27.320 --> 02:28.840
<i> his mother's birthday,</i>

02:28.840 --> 02:31.280
<i> and he managed to save $70
to buy her a gift.</i>

02:31.280 --> 02:34.400
Come on. We got to go to
the store before it closes.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.680
Go yourself.
I'm watching something.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.520
Sam, it's Mom's
birthday tomorrow.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.800
We have to get her a
present together. Let's go.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.000
Go where?

02:45.000 --> 02:48.680
Um, skating, skating.
Just for a little while.

02:48.680 --> 02:53.160
Yeah. Wouldn't want to get
too chilly skating, would we?

02:54.520 --> 02:56.720
Now, keep your eye
on your brother,

02:56.720 --> 02:58.680
and be home at 6:00.

02:58.680 --> 02:59.680
OK.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.600
Oh, yeah.

03:06.080 --> 03:10.200
Skates. I guess we'll
need these, won't we?

03:10.200 --> 03:11.360
See you.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.280
[Crash]

03:41.280 --> 03:42.600
Oh, sorry, ma'am, sorry.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.800
Here, I'll get the door.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.720
Have a nice day.
Bye.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.240
What a bunch of crud.
Don't buy anything here.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.280
Sam.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.280
I'm going
to the toy store.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.920
I'm supposed
to watch you.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.280
No sweat.
Watch me leave.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.520
Sam, we got to get
Mom's present.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.240
<i>No, you got to get
Mom's present.</i>

04:03.240 --> 04:04.520
Forget it.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.800
Would you lighten up?
I'm only going next door.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.120
Just go next door,

04:08.120 --> 04:10.880
and don't leave till
I come and get you.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.800
Yes, ma'am.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.440
100 bucks. Right.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.200
Can I help you?

04:54.200 --> 04:57.080
Oh, um, yeah, um...

04:57.080 --> 05:00.160
I'm, I'm looking for a
birthday gift for my mom.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.680
I see.

05:01.680 --> 05:06.560
Well, my friend, how much
are you willing to spend?

05:06.560 --> 05:09.760
Um, 70. $70.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.040
Let me see now.

05:13.880 --> 05:19.000
Oh, yeah. How about
this little prize?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.800
It's perfect.

05:24.040 --> 05:27.160
Sam, what do you think?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.600
Sam?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.640
It's OK.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.720
I'll take it.
How much is it?

05:35.800 --> 05:39.360
For you? $50.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.320
All right.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.640
OK.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.680
Is there a problem?

05:58.680 --> 05:59.960
Um...

05:59.960 --> 06:01.640
Well, my money's gone.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.880
Oh, I must have left it
at home.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.000
I'm sure I brought it.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.120
I see.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.800
Maybe another time.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.800
OK.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.560
Sam, have you seen
my money?

06:29.960 --> 06:30.960
Sam.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.560
Where did you get this?

06:36.560 --> 06:38.720
The toy store.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.440
With what money?

06:40.440 --> 06:41.800
My birthday money.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.360
You spent that
on a bike.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.040
I had some left over.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.640
No, you didn't.
You spent it all.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.720
You stole my money.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.840
Let's consider it
a loan.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.520
Sam, that money was
for Mom's birthday gift.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.160
It was all I had.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.760
Oh, well, too late now.

06:58.760 --> 07:02.320
No, it's not.
We're getting it back.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.560
No! Can't we just
return something?

07:09.560 --> 07:12.200
Oh, well, guess you
missed your chance.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.160
No, I didn't.
Come on.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.200
Can I pay you tomorrow?

07:18.200 --> 07:20.600
I swear, please,
it's my mom's birthday.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.280
Sorry. Come back
when you got the money.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.960
Does this mean
we can go home now?

07:25.960 --> 07:28.600
Do you know what happens
to bad kids?

07:28.600 --> 07:30.920
I mean really bad kids,
like you.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.920
No. Why don't you
tell me?

07:32.920 --> 07:36.000
Whenever you get snotty
with somebody,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.720
whenever you hurt someone,

07:38.720 --> 07:41.600
whenever you're selfish
or insult somebody--

07:41.600 --> 07:44.400
yeah, yeah, I better not
pout, I better not shout,

07:44.400 --> 07:46.680
'cause Santa Claus
is coming to town.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.040
Sam, whenever you're bad,

07:48.040 --> 07:50.720
and that means
when you steal...

07:52.760 --> 07:55.600
The Crimson Clown
is watching you.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.040
Ooh.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.240
Watch out, Sam,
or it'll get you.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.760
Ooh, I'm scared.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.600
Don't believe me?
You'll see.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.240
[Buzzing]

08:21.880 --> 08:24.480
Now we're late, and
Mom's gonna be ticked.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.520
Who cares?

08:25.520 --> 08:27.440
You should.
Because of you,

08:27.440 --> 08:29.520
we don't have a gift
for her.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.280
Just put some cash
in a card.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.039
You stole my cash,
remember?

08:33.039 --> 08:36.960
Why don't you ask your pal,
the Crimson Clo...

08:39.120 --> 08:42.720
Come on. Come on,
let's go.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.320
Tell Mom
I'll be right down.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.760
Yeah, whatever.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.960
Where have you been?
Look at the time.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.760
Where's Michael?

09:06.760 --> 09:08.960
Um, upstairs.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.760
I told you
to be back at 6:00.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.320
I'm sorry, Mom.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.000
I wanted to come home,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.960
but Mike said he wanted
to see his friends,

09:21.960 --> 09:24.000
and he didn't care
how late we'd be.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.560
Oh, is that right?

09:26.560 --> 09:28.520
Well, we'll just see
about that.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.440
Michael, get down
here right now!

09:32.440 --> 09:33.600
Yeah, Mom?

09:33.600 --> 09:36.360
Why are you so late?
And what's this I hear

09:36.360 --> 09:39.360
about your not caring
what time you get home

09:39.360 --> 09:42.280
when you have
your brother to look after?

09:42.280 --> 09:44.440
How many times do I have
to tell you this?

09:44.440 --> 09:46.120
You have to do
your homework,

09:46.120 --> 09:49.280
you have to have a bath,
we haven't even had dinner--

09:49.280 --> 09:53.440
I've been telling this since
you were 5 years old.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.440
I have to be able
to count on you.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.440
You're the man
of the house.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.480
Look at me, young man,
when I talk to you.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.120
Get up in your room!

10:02.120 --> 10:04.040
I don't want
one word out of you!

10:04.040 --> 10:06.320
Is that clear?

10:11.840 --> 10:13.480
[Chuckles]

10:24.960 --> 10:27.280
Ha ha, got you.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.920
[Knock on door]

10:41.160 --> 10:42.520
Yeah?

10:44.080 --> 10:45.920
Supper will be
ready soon.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.000
Wash up.

10:47.000 --> 10:47.750
OK.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.480
Are you OK?

10:53.480 --> 10:58.120
Sure, Mom. Just mad at Mike
for getting you so upset.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.680
Don't worry about it.
Let's go.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.840
Aaaaaagggggghhhhhh!

11:06.840 --> 11:09.160
Mike, Mike!

11:11.920 --> 11:13.840
Get that thing
out of here!

11:13.840 --> 11:14.960
What thing?

11:14.960 --> 11:16.600
That.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.800
Very funny.
Dinner's ready.

11:20.800 --> 11:24.000
Don't make Mom any madder
than she already is.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.080
[Laughing]

11:53.760 --> 11:55.680
Help me clean up, Mike.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.000
But, Mom.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.560
Mike.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.440
All right.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.120
Can I watch TV?

12:03.120 --> 12:04.600
Sure, honey.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.640
TV: [Animal barking]

12:16.640 --> 12:18.360
Man: Ha ha ha,
you'll never escape.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.000
Come, brutus,
time for dinner.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.240
Man 2: Aaaaagggggghhhhhh!

12:22.240 --> 12:23.560

grows louder]

12:35.280 --> 12:38.280
[Louder still]

12:38.280 --> 12:40.040
[Laughter continues]

12:40.040 --> 12:41.320
[Door slams]

12:41.320 --> 12:43.440
Hello, Sam.

12:43.440 --> 12:47.200
Stay tuned. You're next.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.840
[Laughing]

12:49.840 --> 12:52.880
You rotten kid.
Help, help.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.160
[Laughing]

13:01.840 --> 13:05.640
Oh, is the baby afraid
of a little old movie?

13:06.800 --> 13:11.000
What? But a hand...
It... came out.

13:12.440 --> 13:16.080
What are you staring at,
turd face?

13:16.080 --> 13:18.440
All right, Sam.
It's time for bed.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.520
Can't I stay up
a little bit longer?

13:21.520 --> 13:23.160
Yeah, Mom.
He could watch

13:23.160 --> 13:25.520
a really scary
horror movie.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.640
Sam would love that.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.800
That's OK.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.040
Wimp.

13:31.040 --> 13:34.040
I'm not,
you overgrown dirt bag.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.280
Whoa. Keep it up, and the
Crimson Clown'll get you.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.960
Cut it out with this
stupid clown stuff.

13:39.960 --> 13:43.840
I know what you're doing,
and I'm not scared.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.680
What's wrong with him?

13:46.680 --> 13:47.680
I don't know.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.440
We were at the sto--
ice rink,

13:50.440 --> 13:52.800
and he was being a pain,

13:52.800 --> 13:56.360
so I told him that a
Crimson Clown will get him.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.320
Mike.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.800
I didn't even think
he was listening.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.800
Just give him
a break, sweetie.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.040
He's still little.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.880
Yeah, a little jerk.

14:08.360 --> 14:11.720
You're the jerk, Mike.
You geek.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.320
Now what?

14:55.760 --> 14:57.280
Mike?

14:57.280 --> 15:00.000
What? What?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.800
Nothing.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.600
Finally.

[Crackling]

16:42.400 --> 16:44.560
[Door opens]

16:44.560 --> 16:45.760
[Creaking]

16:58.840 --> 17:01.440
Better get to sleep,
or Mom'll kill you.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.600
[Sighs] Oh.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.920
What do you care?

17:10.760 --> 17:15.000
Hey, Sam. That stuff I
said about the clown...

17:16.280 --> 17:17.880
It isn't true,
you know.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.800
I was just mad
at you.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.200
Yeah, whatever.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.320
Where am I?

17:49.320 --> 17:52.320
<i>Store manager: Come back
when you got the money.</i>

17:54.840 --> 17:56.480
Oh, my god.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.960
[Rattles door knob]

18:00.960 --> 18:02.440
Let me out of here!

18:02.440 --> 18:04.880
What's going on?
What am I gonna do?

18:04.880 --> 18:07.120
Let me out of here.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.760
Let me out of here.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.440
[Evil laughter]

18:11.440 --> 18:15.080
Sam, you're a bad kid.

18:15.080 --> 18:18.960
Do you know what we do
to kids like you?

18:18.960 --> 18:20.160
[Laughing]

18:31.160 --> 18:32.320
Oh, man.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.800
It was a dream.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.720
[Gasps]

18:36.720 --> 18:38.720
Mike! Mike!

18:40.680 --> 18:43.840
Mike can't
help you, Sam.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.560
Mike?

18:45.560 --> 18:47.840
[Laughter]

18:47.840 --> 18:48.880
Help!

19:03.000 --> 19:05.400
Mike? Mike?

19:06.720 --> 19:07.840
Mike?

19:07.840 --> 19:11.280
Mike? Wake up, Mike.
It's the clown, Mike.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.360
It's the Crimson...

19:12.360 --> 19:13.600
[Laughing]

19:13.600 --> 19:15.840
Aaaaagggggghhhhhh!
Aaaaagggggghhhhhh!

19:15.840 --> 19:17.360
Nobody
will help you, Sam.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.800
Nobody wants to.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.440
[Laughing]

19:21.440 --> 19:23.760
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

19:23.760 --> 19:24.600
No! No!

19:26.440 --> 19:28.200
[Laughing]

19:28.200 --> 19:29.800
Help!

19:29.800 --> 19:32.760
There's nowhere to go
and nowhere to hide.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.000
[Laughing]

19:36.000 --> 19:36.720
No!

19:39.480 --> 19:41.640

19:41.640 --> 19:44.440
I got you, Sam.
You're lying.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.840
[Laughing]

19:45.840 --> 19:48.040
No! No!

19:48.040 --> 19:49.240
[Laughing]

19:52.480 --> 19:55.160
[Crying out]

19:58.920 --> 20:02.200
Heh heh heh heh heh

[Laughing]

20:06.960 --> 20:08.320
Help!

20:08.320 --> 20:10.800
No one will help you, Sam.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.800
[Laughs]

20:12.800 --> 20:14.120
You're a bad kid.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.600
No one wants to help
a bad kid.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.800
I'm sorry
for everything I did.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.840
I'm sorry.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.720
No, you're not.
I am!

20:21.720 --> 20:23.520
I'm sorry
I stole Mike's money

20:23.520 --> 20:25.440
and ruined
Mom's birthday.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.320
I'm sorry. Please
give me another chance.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.320
I'll be good.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.920
Give me another
chance.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.240
Mike?

20:50.240 --> 20:52.760
Mike, where are you?

20:55.560 --> 20:56.800
Come on. Hurry up.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.200
Mike. You're here.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.120
Yeah.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.000
Everything's OK.
I'm OK.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.560
I got another chance.
I got it.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.240
What?

21:10.240 --> 21:11.480
I got another chance.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.840
Ha ha. All right.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.000
Sam.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.200
Can I open it now?

21:23.200 --> 21:24.640
Sure.

21:31.320 --> 21:32.640
[Gasps]

21:36.720 --> 21:38.040
Oh!

21:38.040 --> 21:41.000
It's from me and Sam.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.160
Oh, it's beautiful.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.480
Thank you both.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.920
<i> Sam got what he asked for...</i>

21:48.920 --> 21:50.200
Happy birthday, Mom.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.240
<i> Another chance.</i>

21:51.240 --> 21:52.880
Happy birthday, Mom.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.600
<i> Every kid deserves
another chance,</i>

21:55.600 --> 21:58.680
<i> and the Crimson Clown
gave him his,</i>

21:58.680 --> 22:01.160
with a little help
from Mike.

22:01.160 --> 22:03.800
That is a great story.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.080
Yeah. What did
you think, Tucker?

22:22.560 --> 22:24.760
I'll do my own socks.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.760
Yes!

22:33.760 --> 22:35.480
[Sighs]

22:35.480 --> 22:38.160
What are you doing?
You might need it.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.400
I doubt it.

22:39.400 --> 22:43.080
So, are we going out,
or what?

22:43.080 --> 22:47.880
Well, like Gary said, what
goes around comes around.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.480
It's a real hot offer,

22:50.480 --> 22:52.640
r
but...I just think

22:52.640 --> 22:54.800
you need to cool off.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.680
[Laughing]

23:00.440 --> 23:01.640
Uh, can I walk
you home?

23:01.640 --> 23:02.800
Sure.
