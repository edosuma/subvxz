00:12.590 --> 00:13.720
Blood.

00:15.460 --> 00:16.430
Guts.

00:18.270 --> 00:19.360
Dinner.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.940
Zombie Dinner Party.

00:23.370 --> 00:26.430
That looks awesome.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.960
I'm glad you said that.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.420
'Cause I got us...

00:30.110 --> 00:31.860
2 tickets for opening night!

00:31.910 --> 00:36.330
Ooh, I kinda already got 2 tickets for Pajama Sisters 2.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.860
What? Why?

00:37.940 --> 00:40.480
That's just some chick flick! And not even the good kind!

00:40.500 --> 00:42.010
I saw the preview!

00:42.020 --> 00:44.270
They're just gonna sit around talking about their feelings...

00:44.270 --> 00:45.960
fully clothed!

00:45.960 --> 00:48.490
No, dude. I got these tickets for me and Margaret!

00:48.490 --> 00:50.300
I'm finally gonna try and ask her out.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.880
Aw, what? But it's opening night!

00:52.880 --> 00:54.580
Do you know how hard it was to get these tickets?

00:54.580 --> 00:55.380
Hey guys!

00:55.470 --> 00:57.780
Your food is almost ready. Sorry for the hold-up.

00:57.780 --> 00:59.230
Oh, hey Margaret.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.150
I was wondering,

01:01.830 --> 01:05.099
would you, uh, like to, uh, you know, uh...

01:05.930 --> 01:08.170
You're gonna have to excuse Mordecai here.

01:08.200 --> 01:11.910
He has a hard time trying to "espresso" himself!

01:14.420 --> 01:15.830
Good one, Rigby.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.360
I'll be right back with your food, guys.

01:18.690 --> 01:21.030
Dude, did you see how hard Margaret laughed at me?

01:21.030 --> 01:22.560
That wasn't funny.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.460
Yes it was! Man, what's your problem?

01:25.550 --> 01:26.670
Here you go, guys.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.800
- Salad? Where's my French dip? - Huh?

01:28.890 --> 01:31.930
Oh! I'm sorry! I messed up, let me take it back!

01:31.930 --> 01:33.350
Everything okay, Margaret?

01:33.360 --> 01:35.710
You seem like you've got a "full plate"!

01:37.970 --> 01:38.870
Yeah!

01:39.160 --> 01:42.110
I'm just a little stressed 'cause I'm moving out of my place today.

01:42.110 --> 01:42.990
I could help you.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.990
Really? Thanks, Mordecai!

01:44.990 --> 01:47.360
Hey Margaret, I can help you move too!

01:47.360 --> 01:48.500
Oh, perfect!

01:48.650 --> 01:50.860
Do you guys mind coming by my place in an hour?

01:50.900 --> 01:52.430
Oh, we don't mind!

01:52.530 --> 01:55.530
It'll be a "moving" experience for all of us!

01:56.630 --> 01:57.750
Rigby!

01:57.900 --> 02:00.360
- Ahh! What? - Nothing.

02:00.580 --> 02:03.910
Wait a minute... you're jealous!

02:03.910 --> 02:05.160
What? No I'm not.

02:05.260 --> 02:06.660
Dude, you're just jealous

02:06.670 --> 02:08.990
'cause I made her laugh and all you do is sit like this:

02:10.620 --> 02:13.820
Whatever. Just stay out of my way when I'm helping her move.

02:15.670 --> 02:17.600
Alright guys, we're almost done.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.720
Do it. Just do it.

02:20.820 --> 02:21.760
Hey, Margaret!

02:22.670 --> 02:24.650
I've been meaning to ask you,

02:24.850 --> 02:28.980
do you want to, uh, have me pick up that box?

02:28.980 --> 02:31.370
Oh yeah, thanks! This is the last one,

02:31.380 --> 02:32.980
but be careful because it's really..

02:34.140 --> 02:35.100
...heavy.

02:35.570 --> 02:37.330
Uh, do you need help with that?

02:37.360 --> 02:39.680
It's cool. I got it.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.770
Hey, Margaret! Briefs or boxers?

02:44.100 --> 02:46.120
You're so funny, Rigby.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.990
Okay, gotta go talk to the manager. I'll be right back.

02:50.510 --> 02:51.640
Hey, Rigby.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.790
You better leave, dude. You're ruining my chances with Margaret.

02:54.790 --> 02:57.130
What? You haven't even made a move on her yet!

02:57.180 --> 02:59.800
You're gonna end up seeing Zombie Dinner Party with me anyway.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.040
No I'm not. Quit screwing this up for me.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.040
You're just jealous that I can talk to chicks and you can't!

03:06.820 --> 03:08.210
You gonna ask her out or what?

03:08.250 --> 03:10.250
Hey guys. Ready to call it a day?

03:10.250 --> 03:13.770
Margaret! Uh, just wanted to ask you if you want to,

03:14.050 --> 03:16.260
I mean you obviously don't have to but, uh...

03:16.260 --> 03:17.980
Margaret, wanna see something cool?

03:18.170 --> 03:20.880
Two tickets for the Zombie Dinner Party premiere!

03:20.880 --> 03:23.260
- Wanna go with me tonight? - You actually got tickets?

03:23.340 --> 03:25.400
Yeah, I'll totally go with you tonight!

03:25.450 --> 03:27.060
Mordecai, you gotta come too!

03:27.140 --> 03:31.060
Mordecai can't come because I only got two tickets!

03:31.060 --> 03:32.950
Aw, maybe next time?

03:33.080 --> 03:34.570
No. No, it's cool.

03:34.670 --> 03:35.940
You guys have a good time.

03:36.180 --> 03:38.260
Okay. I'll see you at 8, Rigby!

03:40.750 --> 03:42.540
Alright dude, I'll go to the movie with you.

03:42.540 --> 03:43.890
Just call it off with her.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.150
Yeah right! I'm not going with you!

03:46.150 --> 03:48.660
You had your chance and you blew it! You blew it!

03:48.660 --> 03:50.960
Come on dude, just give me another chance.

03:51.030 --> 03:54.950
Ok, I give you another chance, if you admit that you're jealous.

03:54.950 --> 03:56.630
No, I'm not jealous!

03:56.650 --> 03:58.920
Then I guess I'm still going out with Margaret.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.670
You blew it again, you blew it again!

04:04.240 --> 04:05.860
Mordecai, check this out.

04:06.040 --> 04:06.820
What?

04:09.500 --> 04:12.740
Why doesn't he like me?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.850
Looks like Pajama Sisters 2 is bombin!

04:17.890 --> 04:19.980
But it's doing better than you did with Margaret.

04:20.990 --> 04:23.650
3 more hours till my date!

04:24.270 --> 04:25.270
Hey, Muscle Man,

04:25.310 --> 04:27.310
do you know what I like best about Margaret?

04:27.310 --> 04:30.000
The way she's not going out with this guy!

04:32.690 --> 04:34.930
2 more hours till my date.

04:40.380 --> 04:43.010
Aw man! This is just like early!

04:43.010 --> 04:45.970
Mordecai, help! These boxes are too heavy!

04:46.090 --> 04:47.820
Mordecai can't help you, Margaret,

04:47.820 --> 04:50.660
he's too busy not asking you out!

04:52.820 --> 04:55.400
Ohh yeah, Margaret.

05:00.510 --> 05:02.460
Only one more hour till my date.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.950
And that's exactly how it's gonna go down.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.640
Hey "Pajama Sister", what are you doing?

05:16.640 --> 05:18.010
Watching T.V all by yourself?

05:18.010 --> 05:20.990
Well that doesn't surprise me, since you can't talk to chicks.

05:20.990 --> 05:24.170
I'm warning you man. You better call her and cancel.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.570
I can't cancel, that's being rude.

05:26.570 --> 05:28.750
I can't be rude to the ladies.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.970
Besides I've got...

05:30.360 --> 05:32.060
twenty minutes till my date.

05:33.020 --> 05:35.680
Are you sure it's only twenty minutes till your date?

05:39.300 --> 05:41.040
What did you do with my battery?

05:41.040 --> 05:42.830
It could be twenty minutes till your date,

05:42.880 --> 05:44.330
or maybe it's half an hour,

05:44.370 --> 05:46.480
or maybe you already missed it!

05:46.480 --> 05:48.480
Whatever! I'll found out what time it is!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.440
Call it off with her.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.080
Your jealous Mordecai,

06:14.120 --> 06:15.460
it's all over your face!

06:15.460 --> 06:16.910
My face isn't jealous!

06:17.870 --> 06:20.320
Dude, what are you doing? You can't do that!

06:20.320 --> 06:22.320
Can't do what? This?

06:26.060 --> 06:28.230
Now you'll never be on time for your date.

06:28.230 --> 06:30.490
- Gimme back those clocks! - No!

06:40.220 --> 06:41.730
What's your problem?!

06:41.730 --> 06:44.040
Why do you have to be jealous all the time?!

06:44.040 --> 06:46.200
Shut up! This is all your fault!

06:46.200 --> 06:48.240
I finally get a chance to ask out Margaret,

06:48.240 --> 06:50.400
but you had to butt in and ruin everything!

06:50.440 --> 06:51.610
No, I didn't!

06:51.640 --> 06:54.960
I just wanted to see Zombie Dinner Party with my bro!

06:55.000 --> 06:56.680
Who flaked on me,

06:56.720 --> 06:59.430
for some girl who doesn't even know he exists!

06:59.610 --> 07:01.090
I'LL KILL YOU!

07:04.660 --> 07:05.950
RIGBY!!!

07:05.950 --> 07:08.280
No, that's not what I've meant! That's not what I've meant!

07:08.280 --> 07:10.310
Go back! Go back, go back, go back!

07:29.500 --> 07:30.890
Hello?

07:50.970 --> 07:53.100
Hey! Who's screwing around up there?

08:03.030 --> 08:04.840
Oh, it's you.

08:04.840 --> 08:05.810
Who are you?

08:05.810 --> 08:08.200
I am Father Time.

08:08.390 --> 08:11.910
And you're the one who's been running around microwaving all my clocks.

08:11.910 --> 08:13.100
I didn't mean too.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.800
"You didn't mean too."

08:14.800 --> 08:18.100
You've wasted my time, your time,

08:18.100 --> 08:20.830
and you really wasted the time of that guy you killed.

08:20.830 --> 08:21.890
He's dead.

08:21.930 --> 08:23.890
I know, I'm sorry.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.220
Can you bring him back?

08:25.220 --> 08:29.120
No, his body has been blown to bits of star-stuff.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.730
And now, you get to spend eternity here until the end of time.

08:32.830 --> 08:35.530
All because of your pity jealousy!

08:35.530 --> 08:36.820
I'm not jealous!

08:36.860 --> 08:38.760
- Yes, you are! - No, I'm not!

08:38.760 --> 08:41.720
Silence! Peer into my Truth Hole.

08:43.570 --> 08:44.910
What is that?

08:59.440 --> 09:00.850
I'll kill you!

09:06.840 --> 09:09.170
It's true, I am jealous of Rigby,

09:09.170 --> 09:10.530
and even though he's annoying,

09:10.570 --> 09:12.040
he's still my best friend.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.420
Your right Father Time,

09:13.440 --> 09:15.050
I deserve to be trapped here.

09:15.090 --> 09:16.840
I'll be honest Mordecai,

09:16.980 --> 09:19.750
house guests really annoy me,

09:19.750 --> 09:22.640
I mean just look how you wreaked my living room.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.090
Oh, sorry.

09:26.090 --> 09:27.390
You better be.

09:27.490 --> 09:31.200
Now, I'll give you a do over just this once.

09:31.210 --> 09:33.200
Aww, man! Thanks so much!

09:33.200 --> 09:36.460
But remember, stop bottling up your emotions,

09:36.460 --> 09:40.750
because if I ever get you back here again, you'll be sorry.

09:40.930 --> 09:43.780
Now, get on the Time Pony.

09:43.780 --> 09:45.170
Time Pony?

09:45.170 --> 09:48.170
Aww, come on, it's right next to you.

09:48.970 --> 09:50.490
There you go.

09:51.620 --> 09:54.610
- That's how you ride a Time Pony? - What?

09:54.950 --> 09:56.250
That's just weird.

09:56.350 --> 09:58.320
Now get out of my dimension.

10:07.570 --> 10:09.520
Rigby. Your-your here!

10:09.600 --> 10:11.360
Shhh! We're watching the trailer.

10:12.130 --> 10:14.570
Zombie Dinner Party.

10:14.850 --> 10:17.250
That... looks... awesome.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.740
I'm glad you said that,

10:18.880 --> 10:20.170
cause I got us...

10:20.950 --> 10:22.650
Two tickets for opening night.

10:22.750 --> 10:23.850
Wanna go with me?

10:24.350 --> 10:25.450
Yes I do.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.670
Hey guys, your food's almost ready, sorry for the hold-up.

10:29.670 --> 10:30.550
Hey Margaret.

10:31.320 --> 10:35.380
Uh, looks like you've got a latte on your plate.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.850
You're gonna have to excuse Mordecai here.

10:39.850 --> 10:43.100
He has a hard time trying to "espresso" himself!

10:44.680 --> 10:46.310
Good one, Rigby.

10:46.450 --> 10:48.180
I'll be right back with your food, guys.

10:49.020 --> 10:51.320
Dude, did you see how hard Margaret laughed at me?

10:52.100 --> 10:54.600
Oh dude, your jealous! Admit it!

10:54.880 --> 10:55.800
Dude, I'm not!

10:56.540 --> 10:58.600
Well, maybe just a little bit.
