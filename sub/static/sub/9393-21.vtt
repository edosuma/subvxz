00:51.962 --> 00:54.797
Thanks for encouraging us
to come to Gay Pride Day, Brian.

00:54.832 --> 00:56.193
Yeah, this seems
like it'll be fun.

00:56.216 --> 00:58.301
Real fun, not "entertain-
your-wife's-parents-

00:58.352 --> 01:00.269
while-your-wife-
is-at-work" fun.

01:00.304 --> 01:03.139
Laura gets home at 7:00,
so I figure we can stare

01:03.173 --> 01:05.041
at our wine glasses
till then.

01:09.313 --> 01:11.047
So, uh... so, when...

01:11.081 --> 01:13.850
when do you guys think
you're gonna die?

01:16.553 --> 01:18.103
Wow, a parade.

01:18.122 --> 01:19.489
It's like I'm walking
past stuff,

01:19.540 --> 01:21.090
but I'm not going anywhere.

01:21.125 --> 01:24.277
Look, there's the float
commemorating sham marriages.

01:24.311 --> 01:26.746
Sorry, this stomach thing
is acting up again tonight.

01:26.780 --> 01:30.049
Oh, and I'm going on a business
trip to Mykonos for July.

01:30.116 --> 01:33.886
And it says this next one is
the "Shocking Reveal Gay Float."

01:36.974 --> 01:39.826
I had no idea.

01:39.828 --> 01:41.093
Hey, check it out.

01:41.128 --> 01:42.728
There's an air show.

01:45.866 --> 01:47.400
Oh, my God--
they're gonna crash!

01:47.434 --> 01:49.168
No, no, don't worry--
it's a gay air show.

01:49.203 --> 01:50.887
They're just gonna
lightly touch tips.

01:52.072 --> 01:54.123
Aw!

01:54.158 --> 01:55.992
Well, listen up, everybody,
'cause it's time

01:56.026 --> 01:57.994
for our grand prize drawing
for those tickets

01:58.028 --> 02:00.796
to see Celine Dion live
in Las Vegas!

02:00.831 --> 02:02.565
Infertility!

02:02.599 --> 02:03.766
Here we go!

02:03.800 --> 02:05.601
Our grand prize winner is...

02:05.636 --> 02:07.470
Brian Griffin.

02:10.374 --> 02:11.591
Wow, I don't believe it!

02:11.625 --> 02:12.909
Hey, congratulations, buddy.

02:12.943 --> 02:14.143
You know, you're a lucky guy.

02:14.178 --> 02:16.879
The only thing I ever won
was an extra day of summer.

02:17.848 --> 02:20.016
Okay, Peter--
one more day.

02:20.050 --> 02:22.034
Yay!

02:23.169 --> 02:25.238
I saw what I look like
in a car window,

02:25.272 --> 02:26.939
and now I don't want to go.

02:30.444 --> 02:32.311
We now return
to <i>Franklin and Bash</i>

02:32.346 --> 02:34.313
<i>with Indicators to Show</i>
<i>Which One is Franklin</i>

02:34.348 --> 02:35.882
<i>and Which One is Bash.</i>

02:35.916 --> 02:38.818
Defensive blows to their heads
were to send a message...

02:38.852 --> 02:39.869
<i>Oh, sorry, sorry.</i>

02:39.903 --> 02:42.388
"Help me get
into used car sales."

02:42.422 --> 02:44.356
Hey, Stewie, I don't know if
you have any interest in this,

02:44.374 --> 02:46.259
but I was wondering if you
want to go to Vegas with me

02:46.293 --> 02:47.426
and see Celine Dion.

02:47.461 --> 02:49.328
Are you kidding?
Of course I want to go!

02:49.363 --> 02:50.897
Wow, these are good seats!

02:50.931 --> 02:53.616
I know-- apparently they were
donated by Goldman's Pharmacy.

02:53.650 --> 02:55.952
Turns out Mort's cousin
is Celine's opening act.

02:55.986 --> 02:57.420
Really? What's his talent?

02:57.454 --> 02:59.639
I understand he's a
magician of sorts.

02:59.673 --> 03:00.913
All right, for this next trick,

03:00.941 --> 03:03.759
I need a quarter
from the audience.

03:03.794 --> 03:05.895
Okay, thank you.

03:15.222 --> 03:16.472
You almost ready, Stewie?

03:16.506 --> 03:17.974
We should probably start
heading to the airport.

03:18.008 --> 03:19.742
Yes, I was gonna talk to
you about that, actually.

03:19.776 --> 03:21.310
Last night, I was
thinking to myself,

03:21.345 --> 03:23.512
"Why fly, when we can
get there instantly?"

03:23.547 --> 03:24.780
What? What do you mean?

03:24.815 --> 03:26.782
Well, you see, I recently
completed construction

03:26.817 --> 03:29.135
on a teleportation device,
and it occurred to me,

03:29.169 --> 03:31.454
this may be the perfect
chance to try it out.

03:35.142 --> 03:37.977
Wow, Stewie,
that's incredible!

03:38.011 --> 03:39.679
Oh, hey, guys.

03:39.713 --> 03:42.148
Peter, what do
you have there?

03:42.182 --> 03:45.167
Give me the scissors.

03:45.202 --> 03:47.270
I was just gonna make
some masks!

03:47.304 --> 03:48.471
Use <i>your</i> scissors.

03:48.505 --> 03:49.922
They're not sharp!

03:51.308 --> 03:52.508
So, what do you say?

03:52.542 --> 03:54.377
Hmm, teleport to Vegas, huh?

03:54.411 --> 03:56.428
All right, let's do it!

03:58.565 --> 04:01.000
Okay, now, the device is
powered by kinetic energy,

04:01.034 --> 04:02.969
so you've got to dance
to make it work.

04:03.003 --> 04:04.670
You, uh... really?

04:04.705 --> 04:07.623
Yeah , you've
got to dance.

04:08.942 --> 04:10.609
What are you doing,
you tool?

04:10.644 --> 04:12.144
Do you know anything
about science?

04:12.179 --> 04:14.580
You just saw
me program it.

04:18.517 --> 04:20.036
What the hell, Stewie?
It didn't work.

04:20.070 --> 04:21.103
Hmm, that's odd.

04:21.137 --> 04:22.438
It appears there
may still be

04:22.472 --> 04:23.939
a few more bugs
to work out.

04:23.974 --> 04:25.641
Well, it was
worth a try.

04:35.402 --> 04:37.536
Oh, my God, Stewie--
it-it worked!

04:37.571 --> 04:38.688
We're in Vegas!

04:38.722 --> 04:40.156
Yeah, all right!

04:40.190 --> 04:41.674
Well, let's hit the
hospital, get checked

04:41.708 --> 04:45.077
for teleportation
cancer and then party!

04:45.112 --> 04:47.613
Well, since the teleportation
machine failed to get us

04:47.647 --> 04:49.749
to Vegas, I suppose we should
just catch our plane.

04:49.783 --> 04:51.584
I'll repair it
when we get back.

04:51.618 --> 04:54.003
You know, this is going
to be a good trip, Brian.

04:54.037 --> 04:56.522
I really feel like fate
is on our side.

04:56.556 --> 04:58.257
Scissors are jerks.

04:58.291 --> 04:59.892
And I'm a owl.

05:06.663 --> 05:08.013
Oh, wow, look at
that, Stewie.

05:08.014 --> 05:08.997
Perfect timing.

05:09.032 --> 05:10.132
Oh, it's beautiful.

05:10.166 --> 05:12.367
Everything's just
so beautiful here.

05:12.402 --> 05:14.019
This is miserable.

05:14.053 --> 05:16.822
Three-hour delay
and a completely full flight.

05:16.856 --> 05:18.957
Don't look at us,
you  pig.

05:18.992 --> 05:21.827
Take your Juicy sweatpants
and your dirty pillow from home,

05:21.861 --> 05:25.030
and your bucket of Coke, and
get the hell out of my sight.

05:25.064 --> 05:26.798
What was her problem?

05:30.086 --> 05:31.353
You see that, Brian?

05:31.387 --> 05:34.156
That's going to be our
penises later, right?

05:36.693 --> 05:38.994
Stewie, that teleportation
machine is amazing.

05:39.028 --> 05:40.546
It's so great
that we're already here.

05:40.580 --> 05:41.880
Yep, drink it in, Bri.

05:41.915 --> 05:44.550
Time to enjoy all the
Bellagio has to offer.

05:44.584 --> 05:45.801
Classic architecture.

05:45.835 --> 05:46.902
Beautiful art.

05:46.936 --> 05:48.670
Plus, the air is clean
because they suck up

05:48.705 --> 05:51.540
all the cigarette smoke and
dump it in the bad hotels.

05:51.574 --> 05:53.442
Smell that, kids?

05:53.476 --> 05:56.028
It's been in a rich
person's mouth.

05:56.062 --> 05:57.746
Hi. We're checking in--
Griffin?

05:57.780 --> 05:59.014
Ah, yes.

05:59.048 --> 06:00.682
I see you've requested
a bed that's good

06:00.717 --> 06:01.683
for bouncing
and jumping?

06:01.718 --> 06:02.684
That is correct.

06:02.719 --> 06:03.852
I am a businessman.

06:03.886 --> 06:05.220
Just sign here, please.

06:05.255 --> 06:07.289
And you can actually keep
that pen if you'd like.

06:07.323 --> 06:08.724
No way! Really?

06:08.758 --> 06:10.125
Wow, you see that, Brian?

06:10.159 --> 06:11.526
Good luck already.

06:11.561 --> 06:13.601
You know, I know we're
switching to a digital world,

06:13.630 --> 06:16.632
but I-I think this little
guy's still got a place in it.

06:16.666 --> 06:18.884
Hey, we should try one of those
slot machines by the entrance.

06:18.918 --> 06:21.038
You know, they always set
those things to pay out more

06:21.070 --> 06:22.938
so they can lure people
into the casino.

06:22.972 --> 06:24.306
Well, that's a great idea.

06:30.763 --> 06:32.681
Oh, my God--
I don't believe it!

06:32.715 --> 06:33.548
Brian, we won!

06:33.582 --> 06:35.150
We won the jackpot!

06:35.184 --> 06:36.584
Oh, this is unbelievable.

06:36.603 --> 06:39.421
I haven't had this much fun
since I hosted the Oscars.

06:39.455 --> 06:40.689
Good evening.

06:40.723 --> 06:42.958
I just want to say
that I have the utmost respect

06:42.992 --> 06:44.159
for women everywhere.

06:44.193 --> 06:45.527
And also, the Jews.

06:45.561 --> 06:46.895
Good night.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.771
Oh, thank God,
we're finally here.

06:56.789 --> 06:58.707
That plane ride took forever.

06:58.741 --> 07:02.244
Kind of weird they showed
<i>Flight 93</i> on Flight 93.

07:02.278 --> 07:04.579
Hi. We're checking in--
Griffin?

07:04.614 --> 07:07.115
Hmm, I do have a Griffin
here, but that room

07:07.150 --> 07:08.750
was checked into hours ago.
What?

07:08.785 --> 07:10.986
Yes, and I'm afraid we have
no other rooms available.

07:11.020 --> 07:13.221
I see-- is there
a less heavy person

07:13.256 --> 07:14.523
that could check again for me?

07:14.557 --> 07:15.891
I'm sorry, we're
all booked up

07:15.925 --> 07:17.526
because the Slut
Convention's in town.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.328
Slut Convention?
Yeah.

07:19.362 --> 07:21.229
They were promised a
single millionaire,

07:21.264 --> 07:23.165
but it's really just a
bunch of horny squirrels

07:23.199 --> 07:24.533
in a rich-guy suit.

07:24.567 --> 07:25.534
So...

07:25.568 --> 07:28.170
you made your money
in business?

07:28.204 --> 07:31.606
Where's your
room, handsome?

07:34.260 --> 07:35.761
Can I at least have that pen?

07:35.795 --> 07:37.262
No, that's
Bellagio property.

07:37.296 --> 07:38.397
Aw.

07:38.431 --> 07:40.265
Well, this sucks.
Hey, I'm gonna go try one

07:40.299 --> 07:41.819
of those slot machines
by the entrance.

07:41.834 --> 07:43.669
They always set
those things to pay out more

07:43.703 --> 07:45.537
so they can lure people
into the casino.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.645
Damn it, Vegas!

07:53.680 --> 07:56.598
Excuse me, where can I find
some smoking Asians?

07:56.632 --> 07:58.500
Oh, everywhere? Okay.

08:04.006 --> 08:08.143
♪ Luck be a lady tonight

08:10.863 --> 08:14.733
♪ Luck be a lady tonight

08:17.303 --> 08:19.854
♪ Luck if you've ever been

08:19.872 --> 08:22.791

08:50.887 --> 08:53.054
Oh, my God, this
place is a dump.

08:53.089 --> 08:54.556
Well, let's not be
so quick to judge.

08:54.590 --> 08:56.641
It says here there's
a continental breakfast.

08:56.676 --> 08:58.777
Oh, the continent is Africa.

08:58.811 --> 09:00.251
Stewie, this place
is a complete pit.

09:00.279 --> 09:02.047
I mean, doesn't it seem
weird to you that we have

09:02.081 --> 09:03.932
to re-check-in
every 20 minutes?

09:03.966 --> 09:07.702
Also the porn is free, but we
have to watch it in the lobby.

09:12.024 --> 09:13.992
Okay, let's see if we can
turn this trip around.

09:14.026 --> 09:15.393
I'm gonna try some blackjack.

09:15.428 --> 09:16.461
Here, take $40.

09:16.496 --> 09:17.736
I'm gonna go get
some ice cream.

09:17.764 --> 09:19.548
All right, I'll
catch up with you.

09:19.582 --> 09:21.349
Hey there...

09:21.384 --> 09:22.551
Denise.

09:22.585 --> 09:24.553
How you doing today?
I don't know.

09:24.587 --> 09:26.988
I usually have to check
with my boyfriend first.

09:27.023 --> 09:27.989
Oh.

09:28.024 --> 09:29.858
Uh... hit, please.

09:30.493 --> 09:32.527
24? Crap!

09:32.562 --> 09:34.696
Do you know what it's
like to go to the doctor

09:34.730 --> 09:36.731
and see your own foot
in the garbage can?

09:36.766 --> 09:39.100
Okay, you have a good night.

09:39.168 --> 09:41.236
Hey, Stewie, I need
some more money.

09:41.270 --> 09:42.771
I lost it all, Brian!

09:42.805 --> 09:43.772
What?

09:43.806 --> 09:45.807
Well, I was on my way
to get ice cream

09:45.842 --> 09:48.910
and I passed a roulette table,
and I put it all on 16

09:48.945 --> 09:51.112
because of that
Taylor Swift song, "Sixteen."

09:51.147 --> 09:52.481
That song is
called "Fifteen."

09:52.515 --> 09:53.682
It came up 15!

09:53.716 --> 09:55.684
Stewie, that was all
the money I brought.

09:55.718 --> 09:57.686
I knew I should've brought
Peter instead of you.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.321
Oh, come on, you would've
done much worse with him.

09:59.355 --> 10:02.190
He's got a terrible tell.

10:14.353 --> 10:16.054
Any cards, Peter?

10:16.088 --> 10:17.422
No, I'm good.

10:21.310 --> 10:22.444
Oh, this is gonna be great.

10:22.478 --> 10:24.079
I hear she puts on
an amazing show.

10:24.113 --> 10:26.147
She does-- you'll be
amazed that that voice

10:26.165 --> 10:27.866
comes out of that face.

10:30.753 --> 10:32.420
Oh, thank God,
we made it in time.

10:32.455 --> 10:33.588
I didn't realize how far

10:33.623 --> 10:35.357
that awful hotel is
from the Strip.

10:35.391 --> 10:37.926
The woman who cleaned
our room had no ears.

10:40.129 --> 10:41.730
I'm sorry,
these tickets are invalid.

10:41.764 --> 10:42.998
What?

10:43.032 --> 10:44.466
It's showing that they've
already been scanned.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.700
I can't let you in.

10:45.735 --> 10:47.736
Oh, this trip has
been a disaster.

10:47.770 --> 10:50.105
I know. I actually thought
I was gonna win big

10:50.139 --> 10:52.240
and get that plastic surgery
I always wanted.

10:52.275 --> 10:53.608
Oh, my God!

10:53.643 --> 10:54.860
Look at him.

10:54.894 --> 10:57.729
He's so cute.

10:59.198 --> 11:01.483
I'm small,
so this is okay.

11:05.755 --> 11:07.105
You know what, screw it.

11:07.139 --> 11:09.407
I say we just cut our
losses and fly home.

11:09.442 --> 11:11.793
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that.

11:11.827 --> 11:12.928
What? Why?

11:12.962 --> 11:14.896
Well, I may have...

11:14.931 --> 11:16.798
And-and you are gonna
laugh about this,

11:16.832 --> 11:18.633
if I know your dark
sense of humor,

11:18.668 --> 11:21.937
but I may have gambled away
our plane tickets.

11:21.971 --> 11:23.838
You what? How do
you even do that?

11:23.873 --> 11:29.961
It's Vegas, Brian.
You can gamble anything.

11:31.530 --> 11:33.164
I'm sorry, it's 31.

11:33.199 --> 11:34.232
Ow!

11:34.267 --> 11:35.750
How's it going here?

11:35.785 --> 11:37.819
Not great.
I know what you mean.

11:37.853 --> 11:40.155
We just took a pounding
at the craps table.

11:40.189 --> 11:42.357
Look, why don't we just
call Lois and the fat man?

11:42.391 --> 11:43.375
Maybe they can help us.

11:43.409 --> 11:44.609
I don't know about that.

11:44.644 --> 11:46.378
You know that
500 bucks we lost?

11:46.412 --> 11:49.781
I sort of took that from
Lois without asking.

11:49.815 --> 11:51.850
If she finds out it's
all gone, she'll kill me.

11:51.884 --> 11:52.984
Oh.

11:55.221 --> 11:57.489
My buddy's got the inside track.

11:57.523 --> 11:58.757
It's a sure thing.

11:58.791 --> 12:00.825
I like how all your teeth
are different shapes.

12:00.860 --> 12:02.210
Why are you
telling us this?

12:02.244 --> 12:03.578
What do you want from us?

12:03.596 --> 12:05.380
Honestly,
I'm trying to sell my condo,

12:05.414 --> 12:07.616
and I need people to come
to the open house

12:07.650 --> 12:09.284
and talk
about how nice it is.

12:09.318 --> 12:12.404
Wow, the price per square foot
is quite competitive

12:12.438 --> 12:14.205
with similar homes in the area.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.540
Yes, I also love it.

12:15.574 --> 12:17.042
I will likely purchase it

12:17.076 --> 12:19.044
unless others
put in a rival bid.

12:19.078 --> 12:20.378
Well, what's stopping you?

12:20.413 --> 12:22.047
You know, you've always been
so noncommittal

12:22.081 --> 12:23.281
in our relationship.

12:23.316 --> 12:25.050
Do know how much
it hurt my feelings

12:25.084 --> 12:27.018
when you paused before
introducing me to your parents?

12:27.053 --> 12:29.821
And it's the same reason you
didn't take that job in Denver.

12:29.855 --> 12:31.723
I'm sorry I didn't mean
to waste your time.

12:31.757 --> 12:34.359
I just remembered my husband
is a total chicken.

12:34.393 --> 12:37.529
I'm not 100% sure
what we're doing any more.

12:42.568 --> 12:45.136
It's like I say, the best
thing you can see in Vegas

12:45.171 --> 12:46.938
is bar, bar, bar.

12:46.973 --> 12:49.674
Yeah, and he's not talking
about slot machines.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.042
Ooh!

12:51.077 --> 12:53.244
Stewie, I'm still not sure
this is a great idea.

12:53.279 --> 12:55.580
Relax, Brian; we're betting
on one basketball game.

12:55.614 --> 12:56.881
That's it.

12:56.916 --> 12:59.150
Then we'll be out of debt
and on our way home.

12:59.185 --> 13:00.485
I suppose.
I just wish

13:00.519 --> 13:02.620
we didn't have to borrow money
from a loan shark.

13:02.655 --> 13:04.175
I mean, that guy seemed
pretty serious.

13:04.190 --> 13:06.358
Okay, and just a couple
of remaining items.

13:06.392 --> 13:09.094
Please indicate here
if I look like a schmuck to you.

13:09.128 --> 13:10.729
I'm gonna say no.

13:10.763 --> 13:13.365
Great. Then please check here
and initial there.

13:13.399 --> 13:16.067
Uh, next, do you think
this is some kind of game?

13:16.102 --> 13:17.769
Um, no.

13:17.803 --> 13:19.037
Okay, initial, please.

13:19.071 --> 13:20.772
And finally, my date of birth.

13:27.413 --> 13:29.514
And 'll at it for us here

13:29.548 --> 13:31.816
with Duke losing
by just three points.

13:31.851 --> 13:34.753
We... we lost, Brian.

13:34.787 --> 13:36.488
Oh
crap, we're screwed.

13:37.656 --> 13:39.858
Hey, Stewie, give me
$100 from the backpack.

13:39.892 --> 13:41.493
I want to pay a
Wayne Neon look-alike

13:41.527 --> 13:43.061
to beat up a
Rita Rudner look-alike.

13:43.095 --> 13:44.596
I'll give you $1,000.

13:44.598 --> 13:46.631
Pay him to beat up Rita Rudner.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.734
Stewie, we got to get
the hell out of here

13:49.769 --> 13:51.049
before that loan shark finds us.

13:51.070 --> 13:53.071
Yes, you're right.

13:54.073 --> 13:55.707
I've got a bad feeling, Brian.

13:55.741 --> 13:57.575
I've got a good
feeling, Brian.

13:57.610 --> 13:59.444
I'm gonna get
me that honey.

14:06.690 --> 14:08.061
I say, Brian,
this backpack feels

14:08.062 --> 14:09.696
a bit lighter
than it did before.

14:09.731 --> 14:11.332
Well, I wasn't gonna
tell you till later,

14:11.349 --> 14:13.300
but I actually used
part of my portion

14:13.318 --> 14:15.569
to take care of some
personal business.

14:15.603 --> 14:18.255
All right, fine.

14:43.064 --> 14:44.514
Hey, boss, it's me.

14:44.549 --> 14:46.909
I just spotted those two idiots
who borrowed all that money.

14:46.935 --> 14:48.402
Yeah, well, now they're
strutting around

14:48.436 --> 14:49.887
in flashy suits.

14:49.921 --> 14:52.556
Don't worry; I'll get that
money back no matter what,

14:52.590 --> 14:54.441
and for sure I'm not
gonna stop first

14:54.475 --> 14:56.493
and get some crepes
in the lobby.

14:56.527 --> 14:58.428
Where can I get
some crepes?

15:03.818 --> 15:05.338
Hey, Stewie,
thanks for coming with me.

15:05.353 --> 15:06.937
This really has been
an amazing trip.

15:06.971 --> 15:08.272
Yeah, it's been great.

15:08.306 --> 15:09.690
Um, listen, Brian,

15:09.724 --> 15:11.792
this might be a good
time to tell you, uh,

15:11.826 --> 15:14.928
I invited, um, somebody

15:14.963 --> 15:16.396
to come to the room.

15:16.431 --> 15:17.598
Well, what do you mean?

15:17.632 --> 15:19.633
Oh, that must be him now.

15:21.169 --> 15:23.737
Okay, come on, you look nothing
like your picture in the ad.

15:23.771 --> 15:25.155
Shut up and give
me the money!

15:25.189 --> 15:26.790
What? What the hell
are you talking about?

15:26.824 --> 15:28.659
Okay, I'm starting to think
you're not Apollo.

15:28.693 --> 15:31.061
You bastards think you can
just borrow a bunch of money

15:31.095 --> 15:33.397
from a loan shark and then
waste it on tacky suits?

15:33.431 --> 15:35.499
Tacky?
Sir, I'll have you know

15:35.533 --> 15:37.634
I bought this
in the lobby of a casino.

15:37.669 --> 15:38.735
Well, don't shoot.

15:38.770 --> 15:40.304
You must have us confused
with somebody else.

15:40.338 --> 15:42.105
We didn't borrow
any money, I swear.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.358
Sounds like somebody
wants to die.

15:44.392 --> 15:45.659
Aah! No, no!
Stewie,

15:45.693 --> 15:47.060
just give him the money
from the backpack.

15:47.078 --> 15:48.561
Okay, okay. Don't shoot.

15:48.579 --> 15:50.180
Wha... It's empty.

15:50.214 --> 15:52.115
It's just Cheerios
and coloring books.

15:52.150 --> 15:53.784
What? Where the hell
is the money?

15:53.818 --> 15:55.452
Sir, we can't give you
any money,

15:55.486 --> 15:57.421
but if you've got
some milk and a bowl,

15:57.455 --> 15:59.856
we can give you a pretty
healthy way to start your day.

15:59.891 --> 16:01.058
All right,
enough of this.

16:01.092 --> 16:02.326
You, dog,

16:02.360 --> 16:04.227
pick which one of
you two is gonna die.

16:04.262 --> 16:06.997
What? You can't ask me
to decide something like that.

16:07.031 --> 16:10.334
The life of every being
is sacred, just like the life...

16:10.368 --> 16:11.668
Fine. I'll kill you.

16:11.703 --> 16:13.103
No, no, kill him.
He's a baby.

16:13.137 --> 16:14.604
He-he won't even remember
he was alive.

16:14.639 --> 16:15.806
You son of a b...

16:15.840 --> 16:18.175
Aah! Stewie!

16:18.209 --> 16:21.094
Now, get us the
money you borrowed.

16:21.129 --> 16:23.363
Oh, my God, Stewie, no!

16:27.835 --> 16:29.770
Yeah, I was booked
for three hours

16:29.804 --> 16:31.938
by Archibald Meatpants.

16:31.973 --> 16:34.174
He's... he's dead.

16:34.208 --> 16:36.677
Okay, well, either way,
I'm getting paid,

16:36.711 --> 16:39.229
and somebody's
getting torn open.

16:42.934 --> 16:44.484
What the hell
are we gonna do, Stewie?

16:44.519 --> 16:46.219
We have no money,
no way to get home,

16:46.254 --> 16:48.288
and one of the loan shark's
goons is probably gonna bust

16:48.322 --> 16:50.190
through that door
any minute and kill us both.

16:50.224 --> 16:51.591
I wish my daddy were here.

16:51.626 --> 16:53.427
He always knows what to do.

16:56.664 --> 16:58.365
Oh, son of a bitch.

16:58.399 --> 16:59.733
Well, I better leave a note.

16:59.767 --> 17:01.301
It's the right thing to do.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.873
God, I've never felt
so hopeless.

17:06.907 --> 17:08.541
I mean, what are we
supposed to do?

17:08.576 --> 17:10.109
Just wait for them
to come kill us?

17:10.144 --> 17:11.478
Well, we could
go on the run.

17:11.512 --> 17:13.512
With what money?
And they'd still find us.

17:13.548 --> 17:15.068
Well, why don't we
just hitchhike home?

17:15.083 --> 17:16.366
Even if we could get
back there,

17:16.401 --> 17:18.667
we'd just be putting
the whole family in danger.

17:18.703 --> 17:20.670
I don't see any way
out of this.

17:20.704 --> 17:23.406
Well, there is one
thing we could do.

17:23.441 --> 17:24.540
What? What's that?

17:24.575 --> 17:27.243
We could go out
on our own terms.

17:27.278 --> 17:28.779
What? You're saying
we should kill ourselves?

17:28.813 --> 17:29.880
Well, think about it.

17:29.914 --> 17:31.074
We're stuck here,
just waiting

17:31.082 --> 17:32.416
for some mobster
to do it.

17:32.450 --> 17:34.451
At least this way,
we can go out together.

17:34.485 --> 17:36.420
But think
about what you're saying.

17:36.454 --> 17:37.854
Brian, we're dead
no matter what.

17:37.889 --> 17:39.756
At least this way,
it'll be quick and clean.

17:39.791 --> 17:41.758
Well, not clean for the staff
of the hotel,

17:41.793 --> 17:43.827
but that's not really gonna be
our problem anymore.

17:43.861 --> 17:45.429
I-I don't know.

17:45.463 --> 17:47.497
Look, it's not like we've got
a lot to live for.

17:47.532 --> 17:49.032
I mean, I'm just gonna
end up like Chris,

17:49.067 --> 17:51.585
only I'll be smart enough
to realize how miserable I am.

17:51.619 --> 17:53.653
And you've only got
a few good years left anyway,

17:53.688 --> 17:55.822
and that's if we even get
out of here alive.

17:56.824 --> 17:58.558
All right, Stewie.

17:58.593 --> 18:00.794
Let's do it.

18:00.828 --> 18:02.395
Yeah, see, I'm glad
you came around.

18:02.430 --> 18:04.498
You know, the only thing
that was holding me back

18:04.532 --> 18:07.434
even a little is knowing how
much Lois is gonna milk this.

18:07.468 --> 18:11.004
Everyone, I truly want
to thank you for your support

18:11.038 --> 18:13.874
and remind you that,
as far as casseroles go,

18:13.908 --> 18:15.008
we're good on pasta,

18:15.042 --> 18:17.310
but we could use
some more dessert items.

18:19.847 --> 18:22.015
Oh, I miss my baby so much,

18:22.049 --> 18:23.683
and I'm more
of a chocolate person

18:23.718 --> 18:25.819
than a fruit person.

18:33.361 --> 18:35.228
Well, this is it.

18:35.263 --> 18:37.063
I guess so.

18:37.098 --> 18:38.732
Count to three?

18:38.766 --> 18:40.400
Yep.

18:40.434 --> 18:42.819
One, two...

18:42.854 --> 18:44.254
Three!
I'm sorry.

18:44.288 --> 18:45.605
I can't. I want to live!

18:45.640 --> 18:47.457
I didn't really think
we were gonna do it.

18:47.492 --> 18:49.793
You dick!

18:49.827 --> 18:51.228
Oh, my God, Brian!

18:51.262 --> 18:52.913
Brian, no!

18:52.947 --> 18:54.464
Good Lord, what have I done?

18:54.515 --> 18:56.416
I better get the hell
out of here.

18:56.450 --> 18:58.001
What the deuce?

18:58.035 --> 19:00.053
Where did this come from?

19:01.055 --> 19:03.423
Well, looks like
Archibald Meatpants

19:03.457 --> 19:05.358
is gonna have a fun night.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.564
One-way to Providence, please.

19:10.598 --> 19:12.883
Yeah, how much to get
to Providence?

19:12.917 --> 19:14.317
Brian?

19:14.352 --> 19:16.319
Stewie, what the hell?

19:16.354 --> 19:17.420
But how can you be...

19:17.455 --> 19:18.889
Oh, my God.

19:18.923 --> 19:20.924
C-Could it be?

19:20.958 --> 19:22.659
What the hell is going on?

19:22.693 --> 19:24.528
My teleportation machine worked.

19:24.562 --> 19:26.263
Of course it did;
that's how we got here.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.597
No, that's how
you got here.

19:27.632 --> 19:28.899
I flew.

19:28.933 --> 19:31.001
The machine must have
created two pairs of us--

19:31.035 --> 19:32.769
one that was teleported
to Las Vegas

19:32.803 --> 19:33.970
and the other that wasn't.

19:34.005 --> 19:35.639
You're kidding.
That's unbelievable.

19:35.673 --> 19:37.107
I know, it... Wait.

19:37.141 --> 19:38.508
Where's the other me?

19:38.543 --> 19:40.577
Oh, um... What?

19:40.611 --> 19:42.612
Where is the Stewie
you came with?

19:42.647 --> 19:46.016
Oh, well, th-these thugs
came to shoot you,

19:46.050 --> 19:48.718
and I tried to throw myself
in front of the bullet,

19:48.753 --> 19:51.421
but it must have gone, like,
under my armpit or something

19:51.455 --> 19:53.356
'cause it-it exploded
your face.

19:53.391 --> 19:54.958
Wait, what about
the other me?

19:54.992 --> 19:56.826
Oh, it was so sad.

19:56.861 --> 19:58.245
You took your own life.

19:58.279 --> 20:00.213
I tried like hell to
talk you out of it,

20:00.248 --> 20:01.748
but you jumped
off a balcony.

20:01.782 --> 20:03.483
People keep coming
back every hour

20:03.517 --> 20:04.935
because they think
it's a regular show,

20:04.969 --> 20:07.204
like-like the volcano or
the pirate ship thing.

20:07.238 --> 20:08.538
Wow.

20:08.573 --> 20:11.174
Well, I-I'm so glad
you're alive.

20:11.209 --> 20:12.592
Yeah, same with you.

20:12.627 --> 20:14.594
Well, we should
probably head home.

20:14.629 --> 20:15.795
Definitely.

20:15.830 --> 20:17.881
Um, uh, the only thing is,
I'm a little short.

20:17.915 --> 20:19.549
Is there any chance
you could cover me

20:19.584 --> 20:20.450
for the ticket?

20:20.484 --> 20:22.502
Oh, let me see
how much I have.

20:26.273 --> 20:28.708
Good news!
I have just enough.

20:28.743 --> 20:31.177
Now departing for Providence.

20:31.212 --> 20:32.779
Hey, did you guys see <i>O?</i>

20:32.813 --> 20:33.980
No, that seemed lame.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.032
You know, the other you
was a lot more fun.

20:36.067 --> 20:37.100
Which one is <i>O?</i>

20:37.134 --> 20:38.668
Is that the-the
swimming one?

20:38.703 --> 20:40.537
Don't-don't try to demean it.

20:40.571 --> 20:42.756
How does it feel to be
the least cultured person

20:42.790 --> 20:44.291
at a bus station?

20:50.548 --> 20:55.548
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

20:58.256 --> 20:59.456
Hey.

20:59.490 --> 21:00.674
Hey.
