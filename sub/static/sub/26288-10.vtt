Make way, make way.Hey.

00:22.283 --> 00:23.936
Back again, Vicious?

That's Mr. Vicious to you, lady.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.592
Got any milk back there?

00:27.636 --> 00:29.899
You are not here for milk;
we all know why you are here.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.596
Yeah? Well, call a cop.

00:33.729 --> 00:37.124
I can't believe I need a bouncer
on the food line.

Hey, where's Jerome?I think he's taking
out the garbage.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.741
Jerome?!

Jerome!

We need our peacekeeper.

00:48.961 --> 00:51.051
Seems like our friend Vicious

00:51.094 --> 00:52.835
didn't get the message
yesterday, and since you're

00:52.878 --> 00:54.619
the only one he will listen to,
could you just...?

00:57.318 --> 00:59.102
Oh, God. Jerome?

Oh, God.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.969

coming along?

01:41.188 --> 01:42.841
I am sending it to you
right now.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.321
How's our confession summary,
Nick?

01:44.365 --> 01:47.629
I'm pressing "print"
in three, two, one.

01:47.672 --> 01:50.675
Ah, the sweet sound of the last
case before the holidays.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.460
Jack, please, do not jinx us.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.549
If anyone needs me,
I'll either be on the slopes

01:54.592 --> 01:57.508
or drinking some damn fine
whiskey in the lodge.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.728
Christmas in Vermont, lucky you.

01:59.771 --> 02:01.643
You driving up tomorrow?Crack of dawn.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.645
And I'm not even close
to being packed.

02:03.688 --> 02:06.082
Anyway, Merry,
Merry Christmas, all.TORRES: Hey, you, too.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.823
Merry Christmas.BISHOP: Sure wish I could drive.

02:07.866 --> 02:10.130
I just hate flying
on Christmas Eve.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.132
Yeah. You and me both.
Oklahoma bound?

02:12.175 --> 02:13.698
Mom has been baking all week.
You?

Delilah's had the twins there
since Hanukkah.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.400
We're talking
two whole weeks.

02:19.443 --> 02:21.793
I'm sure you didn't mind, uh,
a little break from the kids.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.273
Well, the first day
was nice and quiet,

02:23.317 --> 02:24.840
but every day since then is
a little too quiet.

02:24.883 --> 02:25.841
You'll know what
I mean someday.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.973
Yeah, no.

02:28.017 --> 02:30.541
Playing Candyland
with, uh, Palmer's kid

02:30.585 --> 02:32.195
after Christmas, uh, dinner,
that's, uh,

02:32.239 --> 02:33.805
plenty of parenting for me.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.981
I just love that Jimmy's
having you over.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.722
Aw, I just love
that you make it sound like a,

02:37.766 --> 02:39.333
like a charity case. Ugh.

02:39.376 --> 02:40.856
Okay.

02:40.899 --> 02:43.250
Last bit of paperwork. Donzo.

02:43.293 --> 02:47.167
All right, guys. First round
of eggnog is on this guy.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.647
Ooh, count me in.

02:49.691 --> 02:50.866
Whoa.
I thought you were supposed

02:50.909 --> 02:52.433
to be in New York by now.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.652
Change of plans.
My mom and sister decided

02:54.696 --> 02:56.611
to go on a cruise,
so I decided

02:56.654 --> 02:58.352
to stay here
and catch up on work.

02:58.395 --> 03:01.790
Hey. No one should be working
on Christmas.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.574
Yeah, and no one should be
making eggnog plans

03:03.618 --> 03:04.836
before noon on a workday.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.751
You're so worried about jinxing,
McGee.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.100
TORRES:
Yeah. Relax, McGee.

03:08.144 --> 03:09.972
Listen, it's a known fact,

03:10.015 --> 03:12.279
the crime rate goes down
during holiday time.

03:12.322 --> 03:15.020
Actually, the exact opposite
is true.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.587
But one can dream.TORRES: Guys, trust me.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.546
Okay? It's eggnog time.
We are donzo.

03:18.589 --> 03:19.938
GIBBS:
No, we're not.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.636
Dead Navy vet
in Columbia Heights.

03:21.679 --> 03:24.073
Uh, Navy veteran, boss?

03:24.116 --> 03:25.466
That's not always
our jurisdiction.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.772
Well, it is today.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.948
MPD is slammed.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.864
Hmm. Well, hopefully, it is
an open-and-shut case.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.127
Ah!ALL: Don't jinx us.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.870
Geez...

03:43.310 --> 03:44.441
NEERA: Jerome's tattoo
reminded me of his service.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.356
It just seemed right
to call you guys.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.011
Big dude.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.578
NEERA:
He was a big teddy bear.

03:50.621 --> 03:51.796
Big knife wounds.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.580
How long had he
worked here?

03:52.623 --> 03:54.495
About three years,

03:54.538 --> 03:56.975
but strictly
as a volunteer.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.108
Budget didn't cover
guardian angels.

04:01.415 --> 04:04.418
That's what he was...
to everyone.

04:04.461 --> 04:08.117
Boss, found this knife tossed
in a storm drain back there.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.814
Could be the murder weapon.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.860
Oh, well, all we need now
is a suspect.

04:11.903 --> 04:14.297
Jerome had enemies?No, none.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.386
I mean, except for the
neighborhood drug dealers

04:16.430 --> 04:18.475
he was always trying
to keep out of here.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.260
You know, come
to think of it,

04:20.303 --> 04:21.696
one of them was back
again just this morning

04:21.739 --> 04:23.654
after Jerome had tossed
him out yesterday.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.308
A-a guy they call "Vicious."

04:25.352 --> 04:26.744
On it.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.442
NEERA: After everything
Jerome had overcome--

04:28.485 --> 04:30.313
PTSD, alcohol.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.272
He even got himself a
bed at the local V.A.

04:32.315 --> 04:34.752
And... now this.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.496
Hey. You got anything, McGee?

04:39.540 --> 04:40.802
One second.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.630
It's still loading.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.545
All right, there we go.
Here it is.

04:44.588 --> 04:47.635
Street name "Vicious,"
real name Albert Leary.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.332
He's got a long rap sheet
and a last known address

04:49.376 --> 04:50.464
not far from here.

04:50.507 --> 04:51.508
NEERA: That's him.
Th-That's Vicious.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.467
Bishop, Torres, you're with me.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.686
McGee, the V.A. center where
Jerome was staying,

04:55.730 --> 04:56.687
see what you can find.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.820
Let me get you the address.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.958
Hey, don't worry about it, guys,
I got this.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.179
VICIOUS:
I'm telling you now.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.268
Ain't nobody coming in here
without a warrant.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.617
Why do they call you Vicious?

05:13.661 --> 05:15.271
Yeah. I wish I knew, baby.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.186
You're looking at
a law-abiding citizen.

05:17.229 --> 05:19.362
Maybe it's because
you're a vicious liar.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.451
I ain't lying, mijo.
Me and Jerome maybe had

05:21.495 --> 05:23.235
a little misunderstanding
the other day,

05:23.279 --> 05:24.759
but I ain't never killed nobody.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.021
Did he just...?Mm-hmm.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.544
Did you just call me "mijo"?

05:27.588 --> 05:29.198
Yeah, and you just
called me a liar.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.373
Now if you don't mind,
I got things to do.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.593
We mind.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.290
Get your foot up
out of my door, man.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.552
Get your door off my foot.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.903
We have some questions.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.036
Fine. Hell with it.
Come on in.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.299
See? I got nothing.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.083
But I'm still calling my
lawyer to sue your asses,

05:45.127 --> 05:46.911
'cause I know my damn rights.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.260
Yeah, one would hope so
since you've

05:48.304 --> 05:49.392
had them read to you
so many times.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.785
Damn.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.482
GIBBS:
If you didn't kill Jerome,

05:52.526 --> 05:54.484
what were you doing at the
homeless shelter this morning?

05:54.528 --> 05:56.312
Getting breakfast. That a crime?

05:56.356 --> 05:57.574
You don't look very homeless.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.663
Hey, yo, law man,
I got a problem here.

05:59.707 --> 06:02.449
What's behind that door?

06:02.492 --> 06:04.320
Hey. I said you
could come in here.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.582
Back there ain't none
of your business.

06:05.626 --> 06:06.975
Yeah. Here's the issue, though.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.542
When you say that's none
of my business,

06:08.585 --> 06:09.673
it kind of makes it my business.

06:11.109 --> 06:12.676
Ooh.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.417
I said don't go back there.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.593
Easy, buddy.Oh, yeah, now you say easy.

06:16.637 --> 06:17.812
I told you I didn't want you
in here.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.988
Now, get out!A little late for that.

06:20.031 --> 06:22.164
Let's put the gun down
before this gets any worse.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.426
Put yours down!

06:27.343 --> 06:30.041
Bishop, you okay?

06:30.085 --> 06:31.173
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.653
Look-look at me.
Okay.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.437
Are you all right?Yeah. I'm okay.

06:34.481 --> 06:35.699
TORRES: He's dead.

06:39.311 --> 06:40.704
Okay?
Yeah.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.709
Ready?

06:52.455 --> 06:55.197
Uh...

06:55.240 --> 06:56.894
Vicious is a dad.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.997
Hardly any way to kick off
the holidays, Gibbs.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.303
Understatement
of the year.

07:14.346 --> 07:15.696
And Bishop is all right?

07:15.739 --> 07:18.307
Yeah. Considering.

07:18.350 --> 07:21.353
She and Torres took the kid
to Child Services.

07:21.397 --> 07:24.052
Well, hopefully, they can
locate the baby's mother.McGEE: Hey, boss.

07:24.095 --> 07:27.359
Guess I missed some pretty
serious fireworks. Director.

07:27.403 --> 07:28.317
Why, McGee, where were you?

07:28.360 --> 07:30.232
I was at the, uh, V.A. center,

07:30.275 --> 07:32.408
collecting our victim's
personal effects.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.759
No obvious leads, but sounds
like we don't need them.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.152
Bishop and Torres seem
pretty certain

07:37.195 --> 07:39.197
this Vicious guy is our killer.They called you?

07:39.241 --> 07:40.721
No, they're, uh,
down in the lobby.

07:40.764 --> 07:41.983
Why didn't they
come up with you?

07:42.026 --> 07:44.681
Well, they kind of have
their hands full.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.466
Full with what?

07:49.860 --> 07:52.384
Ah, Gibbs, Director, hey.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.038
:
We can explain.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.475
What happened
to Child Services?

07:55.518 --> 07:57.912
Shh. He's sleeping.

07:57.955 --> 08:00.218
TORRES: So we were sitting
in traffic and I called them,

08:00.262 --> 08:02.873
like, five times and they
put me on hold every time,
like, over and over.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.180
Yeah. They must must be really
overwhelmed this time of year.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.182
You know, so between that and
the traffic on the Beltway...

08:07.225 --> 08:09.837
TORRES: Yeah, so we figure,
bring the baby over here.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.796
We can find the mother way
faster than Child Services.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.407
And once we find her, we will
have closed the case on Vicious,

08:15.451 --> 08:16.974
and we can all go home
for Christmas.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.628
Oh, that kind of rhymes.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.151
So Bishop nearly
gets killed

08:20.195 --> 08:21.544
and they both went
into shock?

08:21.588 --> 08:23.590
No, uh, Director.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.330
This office is no place
for a baby.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.812
Though he is pretty damn cute.

08:33.469 --> 08:36.341
Cool. So, uh, we're good?

08:36.385 --> 08:37.604
No. We are not good.

08:37.647 --> 08:38.996
We are not near good.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.651
But here we are.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.523
That baby is your
responsibility.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.265
McGee, see if you can unlock

08:47.309 --> 08:48.745
this creep's cell phone,

08:48.789 --> 08:50.878
and see if the mother's
in there somewhere.

08:50.921 --> 08:53.010
Nothing in his records
about marital status or kids.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.838
You two, go down
and check with Kasie.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.927
She's running prints
off the knife we found.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.886
Tell her to run the baby's DNA
while she's at it.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.802
You got it, Gibbs.McGEE: Uh, boss,

09:01.845 --> 09:04.239
someone claiming to be
Albert Leary's attorney

09:04.282 --> 09:06.371
wants to see his client.Vicious.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.639
Any prints from
our suspect yet?

09:12.682 --> 09:14.510
I'm only just
unwrapping him now.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.208
Okay. Well, then
this must be our victim.

09:17.252 --> 09:20.081
Yeah. He is a
homeless vet.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.431
Apparently a real hero
down at the shelter.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.130
Um...

09:26.174 --> 09:27.262
Jerome Murray.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.613
Wow.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.397
Wow, what?

09:32.441 --> 09:34.617
You know him?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.924
Just, uh,
reminded me of someone.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.316
Yeah

09:38.360 --> 09:39.883
TORRES:
Oh, good.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.493
Kasie, you're here.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.540
Oh. Here I am.
Is that a baby?

09:44.584 --> 09:47.021
Uh, yes. Yes, it is,
and he is not coming in.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.805
Uh, baby, as in, like,
this guy's baby?

09:48.849 --> 09:50.502
I heard you found one
at his place.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.287
Uh, hey.
We need his DNA ASAP

09:52.330 --> 09:53.723
and whatever prints
you found on the knife.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.638
Oh, yeah. No problem.
What's the hurry?

09:55.682 --> 09:57.379
The hurry is Christmas.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.163
BISHOP: Well, we just need
to find the baby's mother,

09:59.207 --> 10:01.470
and confirm that Vicious
was the killer,

10:01.513 --> 10:03.603
preferably before
we leave tomorrow.

10:03.646 --> 10:07.737
Oh, he is the cutest;
what's his name?

10:07.781 --> 10:09.434
Well, we didn't get
the chance to ask,

10:09.478 --> 10:11.045
with the shooting and all.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.089
Right. I heard about that.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.656
I'm so glad you're okay.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.179
Thanks.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.659
You'll send me blood and prints?

10:16.703 --> 10:18.095
Quick as I can.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.884
I admit, Agent Gibbs, to a
rather reluctant soft spot

10:23.927 --> 10:26.408
for my pro bono clients,
which is why I'm here.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.931
Ah, so you're the one he called.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.672
Yes, and I hadn't
seen nor spoken

10:29.716 --> 10:32.501
to Albert since getting him
a plea deal months ago.

10:32.544 --> 10:35.504
Then out of the blue this
phone call and those gunshots.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.072
I went by his place and the
local P.D. pointed me here.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.900
Well, what can we do for you?

10:39.943 --> 10:41.466
I saw the blood.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.730
May I ask what happened?
Is he even alive?

10:43.773 --> 10:46.950
No. He was a suspect
in a murder investigation.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.736
He would not answer questions.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.738
He started shooting.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.742
Man, you try to help these
people, and they just...

10:55.785 --> 10:57.613
won't be helped.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.181
He ever mention a wife,
girlfriend?

11:00.224 --> 11:02.052
Oh, couldn't tell you.

11:02.096 --> 11:06.056
Soft spot or not, I maintain
a healthy personal distance.

11:06.100 --> 11:09.364
I mean, for all I know,
Albert had ten of each.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.671
This one would have
just had a baby.
A baby?

11:11.714 --> 11:13.629
:
Oh, man. Come on.

11:13.673 --> 11:17.111
Again... for all I know,
he had ten of those, too.

11:18.503 --> 11:19.722
Right.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.985
Okay. Sorry about your client.

11:22.029 --> 11:22.986
Thank you.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.727
Oh, come to think of it,

11:24.771 --> 11:27.251
Albert said that
he was from Florida.

11:27.295 --> 11:29.166
Might be a girlfriend
down there.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.822
TORRES:
There you go, buddy.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.389
Good boy, Nicholas.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.957
Nicholas?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.873
Yeah, we might as well
give him a name.
Hmm.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.179
So you name him after yourself?

11:42.223 --> 11:43.485
No, the... it's, like, NCIS.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.530
You know, you move
some letters around,

11:45.574 --> 11:48.533
you toss in a view.Mm, yeah, right, mm-hmm.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.494
I'd say he's more of a...

11:52.537 --> 11:55.584
Logan or Cody.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.891
Those are, like,
the whitest names ever.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.283
Rude.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.764
Well, whatever his name is,

12:01.808 --> 12:03.940
he is adorable.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.768
Isn't he cute, McGee?

12:05.812 --> 12:07.465
All babies are cute.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.990
Yet you won't
even look at him.

12:10.033 --> 12:12.775
Yes. That's because if we
make eye contact, I will bond,

12:12.819 --> 12:15.125
and if I bond, I'll get
distracted from this case,

12:15.169 --> 12:17.171
which in turn could prevent me
from spending Christmas

12:17.214 --> 12:20.000
with my own two little cuties,
so let's just find his mother.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.089
Okay, you're right.
We got distracted.

12:22.132 --> 12:24.134
And, look, he's all asleep now,

12:24.178 --> 12:26.876
so... we'll be able
to get some work done.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.573
Careful. Babies do wake up.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.053
McGee, don't worry.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.794
We got this.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.100
Okay.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.799
TORRES:
Whoa.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.802
Nicholas, buddy, what happened?

12:39.846 --> 12:41.543
You jinxed us. Again.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.503
All right,
somebody put a BOLO out.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.462
On who?On the 300-pound biker

12:47.505 --> 12:49.072
who dropped a log
in this kid's diaper.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.987
Oh, my God.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.077
Oh, no.
TORRES:
No worries.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.818
We are prepared.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.254
Here, here.

12:57.298 --> 12:58.603
Oh...We got, um...

12:58.647 --> 12:59.866
we bought plenty.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.651
Oh, no.
No, these are for toddlers.

13:02.694 --> 13:03.957
These are way too big for him.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.088
Hey, uh, McGee?

13:05.132 --> 13:06.263
So, like...

13:06.307 --> 13:08.091
what do we do?

13:08.135 --> 13:09.832
What do you mean?
You got this.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.401
Jimmy.

13:17.448 --> 13:21.931
Ah, come on, buddy.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.151
It's nice to know I
haven't lost my touch.

13:24.194 --> 13:27.067
Yeah, cloth diapers are so
much better than disposable,

13:27.110 --> 13:29.852
both for the environment
and for the baby.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.201
Here, let me get that.What? No.

13:31.245 --> 13:32.855
You can't use a stapler.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.683
Safety pins.
Even I know that.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.903
Seeing as we don't
have any safety pins,

13:36.946 --> 13:38.295
these little
binder clips

13:38.339 --> 13:41.516
should do the trick.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.997
Palmer, what are you doing?
You're gonna pinch him.
You're pinching him.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.129
No, it's okay.
He's probably just hungry.Oh, here,

13:46.173 --> 13:48.523
I have his formula.

13:48.566 --> 13:49.959
Oh, no, not
that brand.

13:50.003 --> 13:53.658
No. That's filled with,
uh, preservatives, corn syrup...

13:53.702 --> 13:56.836
Yeah. Put that back.
Maybe some apple juice.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.186
That's even worse. You
might as well pour him a beer.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.622
Hmm.There's so much to know.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.363
Yeah. So much we don't know.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.930
You guys are
new to this.

14:03.973 --> 14:06.236
It's like a rite of passage
for all new parents

14:06.280 --> 14:08.673
to feel inadequate.

14:08.717 --> 14:12.199
Oh, there we go.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.070
BISHOP:
Hi.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.072
Where is everybody?With Jimmy.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.814
Apparently, changing a diaper
is now a three-person job.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.163
Swell. Update.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.078
Well, no help
on the cell phone.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.428
Other than calling his attorney,
Vicious used it exclusively

14:24.472 --> 14:25.865
to call burn phones.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.215
No wife or girlfriend
to be found.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.869
Recheck the numbers.

14:29.912 --> 14:32.306
See if any have
a Florida area code.

14:35.309 --> 14:38.268
Boss, I hate to say this,
but I really can't miss

14:38.312 --> 14:40.314
my flight to Chicago
in the morning.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.793
No one's missing
anything, McGee.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.839
Once we confirm
the killer, you go,

14:43.883 --> 14:46.015
whether we find
the mother or not.Thank you.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.626
It shouldn't take too long.
Seems pretty open-and-shut.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.715
Oh, it doesn't seem
open-and-shut, Tim.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.979
It most definitely is.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.284
Fingerprints?And blood.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.895
The latter being Jerome's,

14:55.938 --> 14:58.723
and the former matching
Vicious, our killer.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.421
Well, not a happy ending
for either party,

15:00.464 --> 15:02.727
but at least it's the quick case
we were hoping for.

15:02.771 --> 15:03.815
Kase, you get DNA?

15:03.859 --> 15:05.513
DNA came back negative.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.732
What?Albert aka Vicious

15:07.776 --> 15:09.691
is most definitely

15:09.734 --> 15:11.562
not the baby's father,

15:11.606 --> 15:14.478
making us oh-for-two
on parents right now.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.568
BISHOP:
All right,

15:17.612 --> 15:20.397
here's the little man,
good as new.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.269
Yeah, no thanks
to you, McGee.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.928
Uh-oh. Nobody's smiling.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.931
What's wrong?

15:31.974 --> 15:33.758
We're looking at a stolen baby.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.814
Hey, wouldn't we
have heard something?

15:45.857 --> 15:47.511
There had to be an Amber Alert.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.078
Make that three alerts,
Director,

15:49.122 --> 15:50.688
just in the Northeast this week.

15:50.732 --> 15:53.169
But none for a newborn.

15:53.213 --> 15:55.519
I just can't believe
the statistics on missing kids.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.826
I mean, they're stolen
from hospitals, parking lots,

15:57.869 --> 15:59.306
people's own homes.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.308
Double-check every case.

16:01.351 --> 16:03.353
Start locally, work outward.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.965
I've got two cases here
in the Metro area,

16:06.008 --> 16:08.837
but neither matches
our baby's age or description.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.621
What kind of monster
would steal a baby?

16:10.665 --> 16:13.929
The kind dead
on Palmer's table.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.192
Whatever lowly, depraved person
you were in life,

16:16.236 --> 16:17.933
here's your chance in death.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.935
Where did you
get that baby?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.937
Are you really
expecting an answer?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.244
From beyond, maybe.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.333
A psychic message.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.552
At this point, I will
take what I can get.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.772
I need a word
with my buddy Jerome.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.643
Yeah, you mentioned that
he reminded you of someone?

16:32.687 --> 16:34.167
Oh, yeah.
Not really, though.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.560
But did you happen to find
anything in his clothes?

16:36.604 --> 16:39.259
Anything that might
have fallen out, maybe?

16:39.302 --> 16:40.869
Anything like...?

16:40.912 --> 16:43.132
Purple Heart.
This box was in his duffel

16:43.176 --> 16:45.004
with no medal inside.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.136
Wow. No, I didn't find
anything like that.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.529
Got me looking
into his service record,

16:48.572 --> 16:50.226
and turns out
he did not one,

16:50.270 --> 16:52.141
but three tours
in the Middle East.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.535
Purple Heart came after
an IED nearly killed him.

16:54.578 --> 16:56.885
That would explain
all the old surgical scars.

16:56.928 --> 17:00.193
After he was discharged,
he battled PTSD

17:00.236 --> 17:03.022
and a painkiller addiction
for years.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.850
V.A. tried to provide support,
but with no living family,

17:05.894 --> 17:08.418
he fell off the grid
entirely in '07.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.464
Off the grid?Oh, homelessness.

17:10.507 --> 17:13.902
An all-too-common tale.Yeah, the numbers
are pretty staggering.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.425
You think the medal
might have fallen out

17:15.469 --> 17:16.687
when McGee
was packing the duffel?

17:16.731 --> 17:18.472
You know, that
or maybe Jerome

17:18.515 --> 17:21.040
just pawned it for cash
at some point.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.780
Yeah. But he
kept the box.

17:22.824 --> 17:25.044
So clearly, it meant
something to him.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.220
He should be buried with it.

17:27.263 --> 17:30.484
Too late to hit the V.A. center.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.573
Yeah, we'll just have
to go over there in the morning.

17:32.616 --> 17:35.228
Uh, "we"?
Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.

17:35.271 --> 17:38.535
Okay, so we'll go
over there early.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.581
Well, the medal obviously
meant something to Jerome,

17:40.624 --> 17:42.104
which means something
to you, so...

17:42.148 --> 17:44.063
why not"we"?

17:46.456 --> 17:47.892
McGEE: All right, you bring
the blanket around,

17:47.936 --> 17:49.329
keep it nice and tight,

17:49.372 --> 17:51.679
and there you go,
snug as a bug.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.681
He's like
a little baby burrito.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.074
I like burritos.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.118
Look how secure he looks.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.946
Like he's back in the womb.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.991
There you go, buddy.GIBBS: Hey. Don't
you got to get going?

18:00.035 --> 18:01.906
Uh, yeah, boss.
Got an early flight

18:01.950 --> 18:04.431
to catch-- still got to pack.

18:04.474 --> 18:07.129
But, uh, I know you'll find
the mother before then, so...

18:07.173 --> 18:09.175
Go, McGee.
Say hi to your family.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.264
Merry Christmas.Merry Christmas, boss.

18:11.307 --> 18:12.265
Happy holidays, guys.

18:12.308 --> 18:13.266
See ya.Bye, McGee.

18:13.309 --> 18:14.310
What about you?

18:14.354 --> 18:15.442
What time's your plane leave?

18:15.485 --> 18:16.791
Uh, whenever.
I can book a later one.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.054
You know, I still think

18:19.098 --> 18:21.143
Child Services
is the best place for him.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.797
BISHOP:
Ooh, and we

18:22.840 --> 18:24.451
respectfully disagree.

18:24.494 --> 18:26.192
I mean, where are they
gonna put him, anyway?

18:26.235 --> 18:27.410
He's already been
through so much

18:27.454 --> 18:29.020
to be handed off
to some stranger.

18:29.064 --> 18:30.848
Little Nicky's place
is right here.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.850
Oh. Now he's Little Nicky?

18:32.894 --> 18:34.330
Okay, I get it, but...

18:34.374 --> 18:35.940
he can't stay here.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.247
Which one of you
gonna take him home?

18:38.291 --> 18:41.598
Well, your place isn't exactly,
uh, baby-friendly.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.905
And your place
is no day care center.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.472
And neither one of you

18:45.515 --> 18:47.430
know how to take care of a baby.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.610
Nope.

18:53.654 --> 18:54.959
:
No.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.874
Not gonna happen. N...

18:56.918 --> 18:58.920
I'm not doing it.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.054
No.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.056
TORRES:
Yeah, this is
more like it.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.668
No. More like it
would be you tending the fire

19:07.711 --> 19:09.757
and me holding the baby.

19:09.800 --> 19:13.152
And since when do you care about
stereotypical gender roles?

19:16.546 --> 19:18.331
Whoa.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.594
Whew. Remind me
to clean out the attic.

19:23.553 --> 19:26.208
You still have this.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.992
Got to hold on
to what you can.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.169
You know, it might be a
better idea to set this up

19:30.212 --> 19:31.213
in the spare
bedroom upstairs.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.519
Uh, we were also
thinking that

19:32.562 --> 19:34.521
maybe, uh,
down here could be

19:34.564 --> 19:36.218
a little bit more
cozy, plus...

19:36.262 --> 19:39.308
you know, the three of us
can take shifts.
Shifts?

19:39.352 --> 19:41.528
Yeah. Like... you know,
like, every few hours.

19:41.571 --> 19:42.703
Yeah.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.052
No.

19:44.095 --> 19:45.488
No shift for me.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.186
No, I'll be in the basement.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.622
Night.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.114
What

20:03.158 --> 20:04.768
You sighed.

20:04.812 --> 20:05.987
I didn't sigh.

20:06.030 --> 20:09.425
Okay, I sighed.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.514
I was just thinking
about what Gibbs said

20:11.558 --> 20:13.386
about hanging on
to what you can.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.083
Talking about the bassinet?

20:15.126 --> 20:17.172
His daughter's bassinet.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.869
Mm...

20:18.913 --> 20:20.088
his ornaments.

20:20.131 --> 20:21.785
You know, Shannon and Kelly,

20:21.829 --> 20:24.135
they've been gone
for so many years, but...

20:24.179 --> 20:26.747
he keeps them
right there up on the tree.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.139
Forever means forever.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.101
I almost died today, Nick.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.496
I'm trying
not to think about it.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.498
Yeah, you and me both.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.413
And that baby...

20:40.456 --> 20:42.763
made it a lot easier.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.636
But it can't help
but make a person

20:46.680 --> 20:48.769
reassess things,
you know?

20:48.812 --> 20:50.597
Things like...?

20:50.640 --> 20:52.120
Like what you just said.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.296
Forever.

20:54.340 --> 20:58.518
What we hold on to,
what we leave behind.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.041
And?And...

21:00.084 --> 21:01.695
I don't know.

21:01.738 --> 21:04.437
I always thought
I'd be a mom someday,

21:04.480 --> 21:07.309
but... I never really
pictured myself,

21:07.353 --> 21:09.006
like, mothering,
you know?

21:09.050 --> 21:11.444
Hmm.

21:11.487 --> 21:14.403
Well, after today, I feel pretty
much prepared for anything.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.712
Ay.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.235
Right on cue.

21:25.196 --> 21:27.068
You know,
I never saw any medals.

21:27.111 --> 21:29.462
Butmaybe that nice agent
who was here yesterday,

21:29.505 --> 21:31.202
maybe he dropped them.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.944
You might want
to look around Jerome's bed.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.468
Thanks so much.
We shouldn't be long.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.470
I must say,
I've been having some challenges

21:37.513 --> 21:39.385
just trying to find
his next of kin

21:39.428 --> 21:42.083
to notify.Jerome didn't have any.

21:42.126 --> 21:44.607
Parents died
before he was enlisted

21:44.651 --> 21:47.044
and no siblings or cousins
on record.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.220
You saved me some trouble.But if you need
a point person

21:49.264 --> 21:51.353
for funeral plans, I'm here...Uh, no, no, no.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.355
No, no, the V.A.
will handle everything.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.052
They'll come and pick up
Jerome's body

21:55.096 --> 21:56.576
right after Christmas.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.360
Ah. Excuse me.

22:02.495 --> 22:05.585
Well, that was certainly
nice of you to offer.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.064
Man's got no one else.

22:07.108 --> 22:08.544
I'll never understand how a guy

22:08.588 --> 22:10.067
like Jerome
could end up homeless.

22:10.111 --> 22:11.417
You know,
some young people enlist

22:11.460 --> 22:13.767
to escape a bad homelife
or neighborhood.

22:13.810 --> 22:15.638
They get some structure,
some discipline,

22:15.682 --> 22:18.380
only to be discharged
and come back to

22:18.424 --> 22:20.208
none of those things.

22:20.251 --> 22:23.864
Same bad homelife,
same low prospects.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.561
Only for some of them,
it's compounded

22:25.605 --> 22:28.521
by the emotional
and physical wounds of combat.

22:28.564 --> 22:31.175
You sure know a lot
about this subject.

22:31.219 --> 22:33.352
My, uh... my dad did.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.092
Wait. Was he
ever homeless?

22:35.136 --> 22:38.182
No, but he always said
he could have been.

22:38.226 --> 22:40.402
Struggled himself
after serving.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.579
Then he got a job with the post
office and started a family.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.799
But he counseled homeless
veterans on the side.

22:45.842 --> 22:49.193
He was helping 'em
get a leg up, he'd say.

22:49.237 --> 22:52.240
So that's why
we're here.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.937
Thisis something your
dad would have done.

22:55.069 --> 22:57.245
Maybe.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.380
Is it true what I just heard?

23:02.816 --> 23:05.253
Vicious killed Jerome?

23:05.296 --> 23:06.863
It appears to be the case, yeah.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.474
So Jerome did it.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.998
He went and ratted Vicious out
to the cops.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.869
Uh, ratted him out?

23:12.913 --> 23:15.437
Jerome was kicking himself
for not stopping it right away.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.787
Stopping what?Whatever he saw Vicious do.

23:17.831 --> 23:20.311
He wouldn't say what, but Jerome
told me right here in this room

23:20.355 --> 23:22.052
he planned to go
to the cops about it.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.489
And now he's dead.

23:23.532 --> 23:24.968
Wait, wait.

23:25.012 --> 23:27.318
Whatever Jerome saw,

23:27.362 --> 23:29.190
did he happen to
say where and when?

23:31.497 --> 23:33.890
SLOANE:
♪ Dashing through the snow

23:33.934 --> 23:37.503
♪ In a one-horse open sleigh

23:37.546 --> 23:39.113
♪ Over the fields we go...

23:39.156 --> 23:41.724
Jack?

23:41.768 --> 23:44.118
Hey, what about skiing
in Vermont?

23:44.161 --> 23:46.250
Oh, I made the mistake
of checking in

23:46.294 --> 23:48.427
with Vance before
leaving this morning.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.341
One mention of a stolen baby,

23:50.385 --> 23:52.300
and I thought you guys might be
a little shorthanded, so...

23:52.343 --> 23:54.824
Hey. Yeah, Palmer,
what do you got?

23:54.868 --> 24:00.177
So you came all the way back
for, uh, the case or the baby?

24:00.221 --> 24:02.528
Aw, come on.
Who doesn't love a baby?

24:02.571 --> 24:04.704
I especially love a baby

24:04.747 --> 24:07.184
in a safe and happy home.

24:07.228 --> 24:10.361
Yeah, which we're still
no closer to finding.

24:10.405 --> 24:11.841
Palmer found a witness.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.321
We need to dig up
security footage

24:13.364 --> 24:15.018
from an all-night store
in Annandale.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.019
TORRES:
What are we digging for?

24:16.063 --> 24:17.238
Anything we can find

24:17.281 --> 24:18.413
on Vicious or our victim.

24:20.067 --> 24:22.025
Hey, guys.

24:22.069 --> 24:25.246
McGee?Couldn't sleep a wink,
so, uh, booked a later flight.

24:25.289 --> 24:27.770
What happened? I thought you
were supposed to be in Vermont.

24:27.814 --> 24:30.381
Oh.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.389
Any luck, Tim?

24:38.433 --> 24:41.523
Well, took some doing, but
fortunately, there is only one

24:41.567 --> 24:43.830
Atlantic E-Z Mart in Annandale.
You said the parking lot, boss?

24:43.873 --> 24:45.527
That's what Palmer said.
Around 3:00 in the morning.

24:45.571 --> 24:48.878
Hard to know
what we're looking for exactly.

24:53.622 --> 24:55.319
Slow it down.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.540
Who's that?

24:58.584 --> 24:59.715
Do we know her?

25:01.587 --> 25:03.502
Nope, not yet.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.552
Well, that's our guy
right there.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.772
That is Vicious.

25:12.815 --> 25:13.555
He's taking the baby.

25:15.644 --> 25:17.733
I'm gonna be sick.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.779
Here comes Jerome.

25:19.822 --> 25:21.781
Wait. What is she doing?

25:21.824 --> 25:23.826
McGEE:
He's giving her an envelope.

25:23.870 --> 25:26.655
And she's... she's letting him
take the stroller.

25:26.699 --> 25:29.005
Oh, my God,
that baby wasn't stolen.

25:29.049 --> 25:32.574
McGEE:
Boss, that's got to be money.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.010
He was sold.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.589
I cannot imagine
what this girl's been through

25:47.633 --> 25:49.112
to want to sell her baby.

25:49.156 --> 25:50.679
You got anything?

25:50.723 --> 25:52.507
Uh, the only prints
on this stroller belong

25:52.551 --> 25:55.118
to Bishop and Torres,
and no hits on DNA, either.

25:55.162 --> 25:57.033
Facial recognition?

25:57.077 --> 25:59.340
KASIE:
No matches yet.

25:59.383 --> 26:02.909
What's that about That's nothing.

26:02.952 --> 26:05.172
It's not nothing.
She's trying

26:05.215 --> 26:06.956
to find a Purple Heart,
Agent Gibbs, for Jerome.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.523
You can buy one online for,

26:08.567 --> 26:09.742
like, 50 bucks,

26:09.785 --> 26:11.744
but delivery this time of year
takes weeks.

26:11.787 --> 26:14.094
Why does Jerome
need a Purple Heart?

26:14.137 --> 26:16.357
Because he earned it,
and lost it.

26:18.533 --> 26:21.580
Yeah. Yeah.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.277
Leon, I'm on my way.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.457
What?

26:31.154 --> 26:32.765
You're such a sweet boy.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.984
Well, so much for your ski trip.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.638
And McGee,
what about Chicago?

26:36.682 --> 26:38.074
What can we say, Leon?

26:38.118 --> 26:39.772
We're here
for the same reason you are.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.164
Doubtful. I'm pulling the plug.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.862
What?
This is what

26:42.905 --> 26:45.908
Child Protective Services does.
It's right there in their title.

26:45.952 --> 26:48.041
But, Director...No, I'm not gonna waste
any more of our time,

26:48.084 --> 26:50.043
our resources,
and all of our holidays

26:50.086 --> 26:51.610
trying to do what they do best.

26:53.568 --> 26:56.092
I'm not sure you'd say that
if you saw the video.

26:56.136 --> 26:57.877
The mother was
sobbing, Director.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.879
There has to be more
to the story.

26:59.922 --> 27:01.445
Certainly herstory.

27:01.489 --> 27:02.708
BISHOP:
Hey.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.884
So, no witnesses,

27:04.927 --> 27:07.364
and we all but papered the walls
of the convenience store

27:07.408 --> 27:08.888
and the neighborhood around it.Nobody knows her.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.977
How's my Little Nicky?

27:11.020 --> 27:13.675
Hmm. Looks more
like a Logan to me.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.546
BISHOP: Hey! I was
thinking Logan, too.

27:15.590 --> 27:18.027
Yeah.Yeah, or like a Cody.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.550
See, I'm thinking
he looks more like a Luke.

27:19.594 --> 27:21.248
Oh, another Star Warsname, huh?

27:21.291 --> 27:23.467
Well, I believe, uh,
Logan is Wolverine.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.905
How about, uh, Superman?
Kent

27:25.948 --> 27:28.081
VANCE:
Well, we may not have found

27:28.124 --> 27:30.605
the mom yet, Gibbs, but this
baby certainly has no shortage

27:30.649 --> 27:32.085
of aunts and uncles.

27:34.174 --> 27:36.132
Hey, Superman.

27:36.176 --> 27:39.570
Let's just call him Superman.Albert's a better name.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.790
I'm just saying, there was
no need to involve Gibbs.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.705
There is always a need.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.707
Look, if you want to help
Jerome, Kasie, you got

27:45.751 --> 27:47.317
to let other people help you.I let youhelp me.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.058
I'm not Gibbs.

27:49.102 --> 27:50.756
Surely your dad didn't help
all these homeless vets

27:50.799 --> 27:52.366
all by himself, did he?

27:52.409 --> 27:54.020
No. I don't know.

27:54.063 --> 27:56.457
Look, just leave my dad
out of this.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.937
There you go again.
Every time I bring up your dad,

27:57.980 --> 27:59.634
you change the subject.No, I don't.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.854
Now find a face already.

28:01.897 --> 28:04.465
It was him, wasn't it?

28:04.508 --> 28:06.641
Who Jerome reminded you of.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.730
It was your dad.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.993
You got all weird when

28:11.037 --> 28:12.821
you saw Jerome's body,
the same weird

28:12.865 --> 28:14.693
that you got
at any mention of your dad.

28:14.736 --> 28:16.607
Look, I...

28:16.651 --> 28:18.261
I'm sorry.

28:18.305 --> 28:20.046
I overstepped there.
I didn't mean to...

28:20.089 --> 28:22.657
No. No, you're right.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.572
I get weird.

28:26.487 --> 28:29.272
Jerome reminded me of
the first dead body I ever saw.

28:29.316 --> 28:31.318
It was your father.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.756
About the same age, Navy tattoo.

28:37.150 --> 28:39.718
It just reminded me
of our last Christmas together.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.763
In the middle
of opening presents,

28:41.807 --> 28:43.417
I mentioned
having second thoughts

28:43.460 --> 28:46.768
about finishing grad school,
and he was... he was not happy.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.990
You know, he always said
I had a knack

28:51.033 --> 28:53.340
if I would just
apply myself, and...

28:53.383 --> 28:56.604
oh, needless to say,
it ruined the day,

28:56.647 --> 29:00.564
and most every day after that,

29:00.608 --> 29:02.610
right up till the day he died.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.656
When was that:
A month later, out of nowhere.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.964
Just had a heart attack
on his mail route.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.618
You know, the medics said

29:10.661 --> 29:13.273
that he was dead
before he even hit the ground.

29:13.316 --> 29:15.492
Mom couldn't bear to I.D.
the body, so I did.

29:15.536 --> 29:18.365
Kasie, I'm so sorry.

29:18.408 --> 29:21.150
You know, the day after that,
I went back to grad school,

29:21.194 --> 29:23.631
and I busted my butt,
and he was right.

29:23.674 --> 29:26.460
I had a knack.

29:26.503 --> 29:29.593
And within a week, I started
working with Ducky, and...

29:29.637 --> 29:31.204
man, I knew in my heart

29:31.247 --> 29:33.467
that I was on the right track
after all.

29:33.510 --> 29:36.905
Wait. All of this
was a year ago?

29:36.949 --> 29:38.907
Last Christmas, yeah.

29:38.951 --> 29:40.343
Well, there you go. Kasie,

29:40.387 --> 29:41.780
that's why
you don't want to go home.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.825
No, I-I... I have
work to do, and I...

29:43.869 --> 29:45.827
No. No, you don't.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.481
And your mom and your sister--

29:47.524 --> 29:49.135
they're-they're not going
on any cruise, are they?

29:49.178 --> 29:51.833
I just... I know it's gonna be
a rough Christmas.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.838
There we go.
Got a hit.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.971
Uh,

29:59.014 --> 30:01.582
Tanya Jacobs, 17.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.019
Three trips to juvie
for drug offenses.

30:04.063 --> 30:06.152
GIBBS: Yeah, Palmer.
What do you got?

30:06.195 --> 30:08.110
We're sure
it's the same Tanya?

30:08.154 --> 30:10.547
Her I.D. and probation number
were used to check in yesterday.

30:13.376 --> 30:15.726
She knows we're here.Manager must have called.

30:16.858 --> 30:19.426
Tanya Jacobs! NCIS!

30:21.428 --> 30:23.082
Tanya!
Please let me go!
Let me go!

30:23.125 --> 30:25.040
It's okay.
Tanya, it's okay.

30:25.084 --> 30:26.868
It's not okay.
Leave me alone, please!

30:26.912 --> 30:28.827
Hey, hey, we just
want to talk.

30:33.527 --> 30:36.486
It's not mine,
I swear. I swear.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.358
It's okay.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.113
You pretty high
right now, Tanya?

30:54.156 --> 30:55.723
I'm not high at all.

30:55.766 --> 30:57.638
I've been clean for months.

30:57.681 --> 31:00.119
There anybody we can call?

31:00.162 --> 31:02.948
Parents?Yeah. Yeah, right.

31:02.991 --> 31:06.908
No. They kicked me out
as soon as I got pregnant.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.780
Then my boyfriend
skipped town.

31:09.824 --> 31:12.566
That's when the adoption agency
hooked me up with Pete and Judy.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.829
Last name?They don't
tell you that.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.179
They were nice people, though.

31:17.223 --> 31:19.747
So nice.

31:19.790 --> 31:23.098
They helped pay for my rehab
and my medical care,

31:23.142 --> 31:26.797
all just for a chance
to adopt my baby.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.671
When did Vicious come along?

31:30.714 --> 31:32.629
Right before I delivered.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.807
I used to be a customer
before I got clean.

31:36.851 --> 31:40.724
When he saw me knocked up,
he offered me ten grand cash.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.552
More money than
I had ever seen.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.511
So I lied.

31:44.554 --> 31:48.167
I told Pete and Judy
that I wanted to keep the baby.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.299
And I felt bad for
breaking their hearts,

31:50.343 --> 31:51.997
but adoption agencies--

31:52.040 --> 31:55.087
once the baby comes,
they don't pay you.

31:55.130 --> 31:58.873
And I knew it was wrong the
second I took the envelope.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.310
But opportunities like
that, they don't...

32:01.354 --> 32:04.444
they don't come around
every... maybe ever.

32:04.487 --> 32:07.490
I thought I'd be okay,

32:07.534 --> 32:10.015
but then I found out
that Vicious was dead,

32:10.058 --> 32:12.887
and-and-and... and now I don't
even know where my baby is.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.804
Tanya, we have him.

32:18.153 --> 32:20.286
You do?

32:20.329 --> 32:22.549
Yes. He's safe.

32:22.592 --> 32:25.334
:
Wha...

32:29.121 --> 32:30.949
What's the name of the agency?

32:32.994 --> 32:35.388
This changes everything.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.607
Why-why does it
change everything?

32:37.651 --> 32:39.740
I mean, maybe this is a sign.

32:39.783 --> 32:42.003
I've been...
I've been sitting here,

32:42.047 --> 32:44.397
and I've been thinking maybe...

32:44.440 --> 32:46.355
maybe if I would've
just kept my baby,

32:46.399 --> 32:48.357
then I would've saved everybody
from all this trouble.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.664
No, no, no, no.Why not?

32:50.707 --> 32:52.231
I've got money now.

32:52.274 --> 32:53.841
I could get us a place.

32:53.884 --> 32:54.929
A nice one.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.499
I mean, maybe this-this could be
my second chance.

32:59.542 --> 33:03.851
Hey, Tanya, y-your best chance
is without a baby right now.

33:03.894 --> 33:07.594
And your baby's best chance
is with those adoptive parents.

33:11.685 --> 33:14.340
This opportunity...

33:14.383 --> 33:17.343
doesn't come around much.

33:17.386 --> 33:19.171
You have come this far,

33:19.214 --> 33:21.434
but you could go
so much further,

33:21.477 --> 33:24.828
and so could your baby.

33:24.872 --> 33:27.135
If you let him go.

33:30.356 --> 33:34.099
You seem so sure.
How do you know?

33:34.142 --> 33:37.580
Because I know. All right?

33:37.624 --> 33:40.279
We all end up
with regrets in our life,

33:40.322 --> 33:42.194
but one thing
you will never regret

33:42.237 --> 33:45.414
is giving your baby
a better life.

33:47.634 --> 33:50.376
More than anything else,
I know that.

33:50.419 --> 33:53.944
And I'll help you get
the support you need

33:53.988 --> 33:56.773
to get clean and turn
your life around.

33:56.817 --> 33:57.992
I promise.

34:01.822 --> 34:04.564
Okay? Okay.Okay, I will. Thanks.

34:04.607 --> 34:08.742
Tanya... what did Vicious
have planned for the baby?

34:08.785 --> 34:12.180
Well, that's just the thing.
It wasn't all about the money.

34:12.224 --> 34:14.356
It was to Vicious.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.532
Who was he selling the baby to?

34:16.576 --> 34:19.709
He said he had a
nice home lined up.

34:19.753 --> 34:21.494
Rich people.

34:21.537 --> 34:24.845
Like, a-a doctor
or a lawyer or something.

34:31.417 --> 34:33.810
Lawyer.

34:36.726 --> 34:39.468
Let me save you some time,
Agent Gibbs.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.470
It's already been
the worst Christmas Eve ever.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.516
Yeah. How?

34:43.559 --> 34:46.084
My wife figured out what kind
of strings I was pulling

34:46.127 --> 34:47.824
to make this adoption happen.

34:47.868 --> 34:50.697
You call paying a drug dealer
to buy you a baby

34:50.740 --> 34:52.438
"pulling strings"?

34:52.481 --> 34:54.744
Stupid, I know.

34:54.788 --> 34:57.356
Oh, it is way more than stupid.After I got Albert

34:57.399 --> 35:00.446
the plea deal, he said if there
was anything he could do.

35:00.489 --> 35:02.143
And he meant anything.

35:02.187 --> 35:04.624
So you said, "How about a baby?"

35:04.667 --> 35:06.278
Our third adoption
had just fallen through,

35:06.321 --> 35:07.583
and we were crushed.

35:07.627 --> 35:09.194
Albert said

35:09.237 --> 35:11.544
for 25 grand, he would find us

35:11.587 --> 35:13.850
a healthy
and willing birth mother.

35:13.894 --> 35:17.245
$25,000.I was desperate
to give my wife a family.

35:17.289 --> 35:20.814
Never expecting
anyone was gonna die over it.

35:25.862 --> 35:28.082
JIMMY:
Hey.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.128
Hear the good news?Yeah.

35:30.171 --> 35:33.566
Uh, great. I mean, bittersweet,
but at least we can find

35:33.609 --> 35:36.003
the original
adoptive parents now.I'm sorry.

35:36.046 --> 35:37.744
Am I interrupting something?Oh, no. Just...

35:37.787 --> 35:40.877
just deleting a bunch of spam.
You headed home?

35:40.921 --> 35:42.792
Yeah, I just wanted to,
uh, come by.

35:42.836 --> 35:45.621
Drop off a little something.Jimmy, why?

35:45.665 --> 35:47.884
You didn't have to.
I didn't get you anything.

35:47.928 --> 35:50.148
Yes, you did. Trust me.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.715
Do I open it now or...?That would be the idea, yeah.

35:52.759 --> 35:55.327
Just o

35:57.546 --> 35:59.983
It's not Jerome's,

36:00.027 --> 36:01.768
but it's-it's someone's.

36:01.811 --> 36:03.987
Someone who doesn't need
it anymore, I guess.

36:04.031 --> 36:06.294
Who?I don't know.

36:06.338 --> 36:09.079
But that is why
you involve Gibbs.

36:09.123 --> 36:10.951
He knows people.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.217
Thank you, Jimmy.

36:17.349 --> 36:19.438
Merry Christmas.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.790
Oh, and Kasie?

36:23.833 --> 36:26.053
I'm a big believer in fate.

36:26.096 --> 36:28.055
I know there's nothing good
that can be said

36:28.098 --> 36:30.231
about your dad
passing away,

36:30.275 --> 36:33.234
but if nothing else,
it led you here.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.236
To us.

36:35.280 --> 36:39.109
I sometimes think maybe my dad
gave me a little...

36:39.153 --> 36:41.634
shove from above.

36:41.677 --> 36:43.331
Well, we're all glad
that he did.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.080
Hey.

36:53.123 --> 36:55.996
We've got the hang of this now.

36:56.039 --> 36:59.173
Yeah. He's looking stylish, too.
Aren't you, little Cody?

36:59.217 --> 37:00.435
What

37:00.479 --> 37:02.437
Consider that
my Christmas present to you.

37:02.481 --> 37:04.265
McGEE:
Great news.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.485
The agency tracked down
Tanya's adoptive parents.

37:06.528 --> 37:08.574
Pete and Judy Shaw

37:08.617 --> 37:10.750
of Fairfax.
They're only 20 minutes away.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.622
Oh, that's... that's great.Mm-hmm.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.885
I got a plane to catch.

37:15.929 --> 37:18.845
May the Force be with you,
little Han Solo.

37:21.195 --> 37:23.110
Really good job, you guys.

37:23.153 --> 37:24.503
Thanks.

37:27.245 --> 37:30.944
Okay, then, little
guy. Here we go.

37:30.987 --> 37:34.252
Yeah, so, uh...

37:34.295 --> 37:36.471
we tell Gibbs now, right?

37:36.515 --> 37:38.691
Mm-hmm.Mm-hmm.

37:38.734 --> 37:41.302
You know, they say,
"You can't take it with you."

37:41.346 --> 37:44.087
But this

37:44.131 --> 37:47.090
This, Jerome, you are...

37:47.134 --> 37:50.746
most definitely taking with you.

37:50.790 --> 37:54.272
Or as my father used to say...

37:54.315 --> 37:56.709
"No greater love than this,

37:56.752 --> 37:59.929
that one should lay down
his life for his friends."

38:06.153 --> 38:08.503
WOMAN: Hey, baby.
What's up

38:08.547 --> 38:11.463
No, Mom, I'm fine, really.
I just, um...

38:11.506 --> 38:14.422
I actually finished that work
faster than I thought

38:14.466 --> 38:17.643
and was thinking maybe I could
still catch a flight home?

38:17.686 --> 38:21.951
Oh! We'd love to
have you here, sweetheart.

38:40.143 --> 38:41.057
Hey, Jack.

38:41.101 --> 38:42.885
Hey.

38:42.929 --> 38:44.365
You still coming?

38:44.409 --> 38:46.193
Are you kidding me?

38:46.236 --> 38:48.804
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.202
Special Agent Gibbs?

38:55.245 --> 38:56.943
Ms. Miles.

38:56.986 --> 38:59.641
Lydia, yes.
From the adoption agency.

38:59.685 --> 39:02.557
I spoke with your Agent McGee
on the phone.Special Agent Sloane.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.603
Thank you so much for arranging
this on such short notice.

39:04.646 --> 39:06.822
Of course. We were overjoyed.

39:06.866 --> 39:08.955
We worked it all out with Tanya.

39:08.998 --> 39:10.957
She spoke very highly
of you both.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.741
I take it the child is with you?

39:12.785 --> 39:14.700
Absolutely.Great.

39:17.790 --> 39:20.096
All right, here we are. Hi.Hi.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.447
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you.
Yeah.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.666
And there he is.Oh.

39:26.451 --> 39:29.279
Wonderful. Well,
I'll just take him from here.

39:29.323 --> 39:30.063
No.

39:31.325 --> 39:33.893
Sorry. It's just we'd like to...

39:33.936 --> 39:36.286
deliver him ourselves,
if that's okay.

39:36.330 --> 39:39.159
Actually, that might be better.
I told the Shaws I was coming

39:39.202 --> 39:40.726
but didn't want
to get their hopes up

39:40.769 --> 39:42.031
before you got here.

39:42.075 --> 39:43.337
They've been let down before.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.686
Yes, we know.

39:46.862 --> 39:48.560
Why don't I just, uh, go on

39:48.603 --> 39:50.170
and break the good news
while you wait at the door?

39:51.824 --> 39:54.087
Great.

39:54.130 --> 39:55.654
This is a nice neighborhood.

39:55.697 --> 39:58.439
Good schools. I checked.
