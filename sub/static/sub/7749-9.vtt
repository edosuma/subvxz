WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:02.659
MAN:
It-it's about the whole cosmos.

00:02.700 --> 00:05.794
It-it's not just in our heads
or what happens to us.

00:05.830 --> 00:08.333
I mean, we want to make it
about-about crime on the streets

00:08.370 --> 00:11.203
and all that, but it's...

00:11.240 --> 00:14.277
it's not about things,
it's about, um... e-everything.

00:14.310 --> 00:16.403
Right? So, what do you
do about that?

00:16.450 --> 00:18.509
What-what do you do
about everything?

00:20.380 --> 00:22.416
Well, you start
with the broken window theory.

00:22.450 --> 00:25.419
Even one broken window

00:25.450 --> 00:27.680
creates the condition
for antisocial behavior.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.621
I remember a time
when Chicago was different.

00:30.660 --> 00:34.152
When people helped each other.
I remember being a little kid

00:34.200 --> 00:37.294
and playing out on the street,
going trick-or-treating.

00:37.330 --> 00:38.763
I don't think anyone would allow
their child to do that...

00:38.800 --> 00:40.165
No, no, cut the last sentence.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.690
Go back to the other thing
she said.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.833
I remember growing up as
a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.428
What, with a jump cut?

00:45.470 --> 00:48.507
No, the "morning
in America" stuff.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.474
What are you doing? Cows?

00:51.510 --> 00:52.738
When were there ever
cows In Chicago?

00:52.780 --> 00:54.316
You said "morning
in America"...

00:54.350 --> 00:55.840
Yeah... kids
playing ball,

00:55.880 --> 00:57.108
water hoses,

00:57.150 --> 00:59.482
Uncle Sam, blah-blah stuff.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.427
And keep
Alicia's voice running.

01:04.460 --> 01:05.779
ALICIA:
I mean, remember being a kid

01:05.830 --> 01:07.627
and playing on the street,

01:07.660 --> 01:09.423
going trick-or-treating...
Then go to the hug.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.358
Yeah, sure.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.539
Let's try it with,
uh, the guitar under it.

01:13.570 --> 01:15.458
EDITOR: Okay...
(guitar playing gentle tune)

01:15.500 --> 01:17.536
ALICIA:
I remember being a kid
and playing on the street,

01:17.570 --> 01:19.060
going trick-or-treating.

01:20.810 --> 01:23.506
Ah! Everybody
likes Alicia, see?

01:23.550 --> 01:26.178
Uh, have the cosmos idiot nod
his head. There was something

01:26.220 --> 01:28.370
where he was nodding his head.
He has a nervous tic.
He's always nodding his head.

01:28.420 --> 01:29.717
What do I care?
What are you, his physician?

01:33.160 --> 01:36.152
ALICIA:
I remember being a kid
and playing on the street,

01:36.190 --> 01:38.488
going trick-or-treating.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.828
Yeah.._. even the cosmos
Idiot agrees.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.828
Uh, then cut to Peter,

01:42.870 --> 01:45.566
and, uh, keep
the guitar going.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.433
...playing on the street,
going trick-or-treating.

01:48.470 --> 01:49.562
PETER:
The key is caring

01:49.610 --> 01:52.579
and Alicia cares.

01:52.610 --> 01:56.398
I think the job of a state's
attorney is so overwhelming,

01:56.450 --> 01:59.647
that it needs a person whose
heart is in the right place.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.819
And do you have a take on
Frank Prady, Mr. Governor?

02:01.850 --> 02:03.738
Uh, just tell me what you
want me to say and then

02:03.790 --> 02:05.917
I'll just say it.
Uh, Alicia as an
experienced candidate.

02:05.950 --> 02:07.611
Peter, uh, don't go
too hard on Prady.

02:07.660 --> 02:08.809
There_are_
legal ramifications.

02:08.860 --> 02:09.884
Whenever you're ready,
Mr. Governor.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.522
I like Frank Prady,

02:11.560 --> 02:12.754
but if there was ever a time

02:12.800 --> 02:14.529
for a state's attorney who has

02:14.560 --> 02:16.528
experience and compassion...

02:16.570 --> 02:18.299
it's now.
Good. Use that as a transition

02:18.330 --> 02:19.797
to the shooting;
the news footage.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.161
Mm-hmm, make it black
and white, grainy.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.303
Go music.
Go to the Irish music.

02:26.340 --> 02:28.638
(upbeat Irish music playing)

02:28.680 --> 02:30.545
Great, yeah, that's it, a-a
festive courthouse shooting!

02:30.580 --> 02:31.899
What are you-- an idiot?

02:31.950 --> 02:35.317
The Irish wake music,
the keening music.

02:37.350 --> 02:40.808
(somber Irish music playing)

02:40.860 --> 02:42.555
Good. Now, go
to the Finn interview.

02:42.590 --> 02:45.423
I don't really
like going into it.

02:45.460 --> 02:49.294
JOHNNY:
This is for Alicia,
so anything you can tell us.

02:49.330 --> 02:52.197
I was in court
across from WIll...

02:52.240 --> 02:53.662
Could you use
his full name?

02:53.700 --> 02:55.668
Yeah.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.601
I was in _court
across from WIll Gardner.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.870
We were at sidebar
with the judge

03:00.910 --> 03:01.934
when there was a gunshot.

03:01.980 --> 03:04.869
Will was dying.

03:04.910 --> 03:06.571
And that's where you go,
and you say

03:06.620 --> 03:07.917
sadness blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:07.950 --> 03:08.974
And then we cut back

03:09.020 --> 03:10.419
to the diner op.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.486
ALICIA: The murder rates
are just Insane.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.215
I tried to stop the bleeding,
but I couldn't.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.955
So I just sat there with him,

03:15.990 --> 03:17.753
waiting for the paramedics
to arrive.

03:17.790 --> 03:18.757
I watched the life

03:18.790 --> 03:19.757
of this man, this good man,

03:19.800 --> 03:21.449
fade away because he was

03:21.500 --> 03:23.365
trying to help someone.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.662
Are you really thinking
of using this?

03:24.700 --> 03:25.792
We're not just
thinking of using it.

03:25.830 --> 03:26.899
We're using it.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.430
(groans)
It's so crass. It's awful.

03:28.470 --> 03:30.506
I'm sorry, who are you
again? Who is she?

03:30.540 --> 03:32.770
I'm the body woman.
Then what are you doing talking?

03:32.810 --> 03:34.437
Alicia, this video is meant
to introduce you; the public

03:34.480 --> 03:36.471
doesn't know you. We need
to tell them your story.

03:36.510 --> 03:38.239
The shooting is a
part of your story.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.249
Yeah, but it's so corny
with the boo-hoo-hoo music.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.918
(laughs) I'm sorry, how many
campaigns have you run?

03:42.950 --> 03:44.611
No, seriously.

03:44.650 --> 03:47.312
How many?
Okay, okay.
Tell the scandal stuff.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.009
Tell them
how I raised my kids...
No, this says

03:49.060 --> 03:51.551
why you're running now. You were
personally touched by murder.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.251
Do you think Prady's
gonna have

03:53.300 --> 03:54.722
any trouble talking
about the death of his dad?

03:54.760 --> 03:56.660
With the photos of the car
accident and him crying?

03:56.700 --> 03:58.691
He's up by three points,
we have no media budget...

03:58.730 --> 03:59.958
How about the music
from Titanic?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.831
You could even cut
to shots from Titanic.

04:01.870 --> 04:03.030
Johnny, I'm losing it.
I'm losing it here!

04:03.070 --> 04:05.038
Alicia, we want this
to go viral online.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.628
So, that can't happen
unless it's dramatic.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.829
Okay, so...

04:07.880 --> 04:09.575
use the the comparative ad.

04:09.610 --> 04:10.645
Where's the comparative ad?
We're still waiting

04:10.680 --> 04:12.443
on the full oppo
research on Prady.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.744
And... I need you to call Peter.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.645
To set up a joint interview
for the two of you for tomorrow.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.011
We need a joint interview?
If you want people

04:19.050 --> 04:20.984
to stop asking questions
about your marriage, yeah.
(cell phone ringing)

04:21.020 --> 04:24.057
Yeah, Diane.

04:24.090 --> 04:26.320
Sorry, I can't make it.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.499
She can't make it.
Why not?

04:28.530 --> 04:29.519
Alicia, I'll have to call
you back. He's here.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.923
Good morning.

04:30.970 --> 04:33.393
My name is Stu Harper.
I am the Special Agent

04:33.440 --> 04:36.034
in charge of the Chicago
FBI field office.

04:36.070 --> 04:37.537
I was hoping we could

04:37.570 --> 04:38.867
just have a moment to talk

04:38.910 --> 04:40.070
before anyone shouts

04:40.110 --> 04:41.634
"attorney/client privilege"

04:41.680 --> 04:43.944
or "grand jury subpoena"
at each other.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.402
Well, that's good news,
Agent Harper,

04:45.450 --> 04:46.747
because I don't shout.

04:46.780 --> 04:48.475
Good-- we're making
progress already.

04:48.520 --> 04:51.080
We need your help, Cary.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.680
We are investigating
Lemond Bishop

04:53.720 --> 04:55.608
and his drug empire,
and we need your help

04:55.660 --> 04:57.480
building a case.
Unfortunately,

04:57.530 --> 04:59.828
Mr. Agos was one
of Mr. Bishop's attorneys,

04:59.860 --> 05:01.691
so he can't...
I understand.

05:01.730 --> 05:03.425
And I know you're being
prosecuted by

05:03.470 --> 05:04.425
the State's Attorney's office,
Cary.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.869
We sympathize.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.561
I want you to know
that our investigation

05:07.600 --> 05:08.760
has nothing to do with theirs.

05:08.800 --> 05:09.960
Oh, great.
In fact,

05:10.010 --> 05:11.102
we want to help you.

05:11.140 --> 05:12.971
Agent Delaney.

05:13.010 --> 05:15.979
Please meet Cary Agos
and Diane Lockhart.

05:16.010 --> 05:18.046
LANA: Yes, we've had
dealings before.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.848
Nice to see you again.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.484
HARPER:
I think you'll agree these are

05:22.520 --> 05:23.839
highly unusual circumstances--

05:23.890 --> 05:25.983
an FBI agent playing you

05:26.020 --> 05:27.658
one of our wiretaps.

05:27.690 --> 05:29.988
But we have a good reason.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.383
Lana?

05:31.430 --> 05:32.590
BISHOP (staticky):
I can't move.

05:32.630 --> 05:33.790
I can't do business.

05:33.830 --> 05:34.990
They're crawling up my ass.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.361
MAN:
It's not a dead end.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.992
BISHOP:
Then why am I drowning here?

05:38.030 --> 05:40.760
MAN: You know why-- the lawyer.
Cary Agos.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.358
Look, we're not saying
he flipped, Lemond.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.468
But the cops smell blood here.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.000
MAN 2:
We're seen as weak.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.871
BISHOP: Then what do we do?
He's a white lawyer.

05:46.910 --> 05:49.549
People take notice.
He can't just disappear.

05:49.580 --> 05:52.469
(static crackling)

05:52.520 --> 05:54.476
MAN:
One to the back of the head.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.784
(static crackling)

05:57.990 --> 05:59.912
BISHOP:
Okay. I want it done.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.518
Next week.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.448
Make this end.
MAN: You're sure?

06:03.490 --> 06:06.084
BISHOP: Phone me when you got a
plan, where and how because I...

06:06.130 --> 06:08.724
(static crackling)

06:08.760 --> 06:11.627
That's it.
That's an official FBI wiretap

06:11.670 --> 06:14.093
of Lemond Bishop discussing
how to murder you, Cary.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.835
DIANE: When was
it recorded?

06:15.870 --> 06:17.167
_ LANA:
Five days ago.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.838
Thursday the 13th
at Bishop's house.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.769
The time frame they're
discussing for your murder

06:22.810 --> 06:24.448
is this week.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.038
Uh, we'd like
a copy of the tape.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.445
HARPER: N0.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.742
It's in both our interests

06:28.780 --> 06:30.543
to put Mr. Bishop away.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.080
So, help us prosecute him.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.156
Go arrest him.

06:34.190 --> 06:36.181
If Mr. Bishop is threatening me,

06:36.220 --> 06:38.723
go arrest him.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.455
Why do you need me?

06:40.500 --> 06:42.559
Uh, Mr. Bishop and
his lieutenants were

06:42.600 --> 06:44.568
very careful in
what they said.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.828
It's not enough
for an arrest.

06:45.870 --> 06:47.599
But it is enough for you

06:47.640 --> 06:48.629
to be very,
very worried.

06:48.670 --> 06:51.537
Okay. Thank you.

06:51.570 --> 06:53.128
Uh, Cary,

06:53.180 --> 06:55.978
he's talking about
murdering you this week.

06:56.010 --> 06:58.046
A little hint
for next time you do this:

06:58.080 --> 07:00.219
Don't have the woman who's
sleeping with my girlfriend

07:00.250 --> 07:02.115
break it to me.
HARPER:
You're... I'm sorry, what?

07:02.150 --> 07:04.448
Next time you try to get me
to flip, don't use her.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.522
(elevator bell dings)

07:10.560 --> 07:12.448
It's a fake.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.923
Bishop was out of town
in Florida on the 13th.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.769
Even if you're right, you need
to act like you're wrong.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.461
Bishop could threaten
something like that.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.730
No, you're right.
What do we do?

07:20.770 --> 07:22.806
_ DIANE: _
Kalinda, hand your ongomg cases

07:22.840 --> 07:24.808
to Robyn.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.876
The FBI played us
a tape this morning

07:26.910 --> 07:28.207
of Bishop threatening Cary.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.208
Threatening him with what?

07:30.250 --> 07:31.877
Assassination.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.639
He's worried Cary
will turn on him.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.649
Cary thinks that
the tape was fake,

07:36.690 --> 07:39.045
cobbled together from
other wiretaps, but

07:39.090 --> 07:41.957
I need to be sure.
What do you think?

07:41.990 --> 07:44.049
Bishop may want him dead.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.489
I would agree.

07:45.530 --> 07:46.792
Cary says that Bishop was

07:46.830 --> 07:48.525
out of town on November 13

07:48.560 --> 07:50.061
when the tape was
recorded at his house.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.499
Could you check that out?
Yeah.

07:51.530 --> 07:52.667
Uh...

07:52.700 --> 07:54.793
we need to hire Cary
a bodyguard.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.193
Can you do that?
Sure.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.834
Court says I can't be
within 30 feet of him,

07:58.870 --> 07:59.939
so I'll need your help.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.732
Whatever you need.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.771
Alicia!

08:07.220 --> 08:08.869
Mr. Prady.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.740
Frank. Hello.

08:10.790 --> 08:11.939
I didn't think we had...

08:11.990 --> 08:12.979
Uh, an appointment, no.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.055
I didn't want to get

08:14.090 --> 08:15.250
into all the mess of that.

08:15.290 --> 08:16.279
Uh, do you have a minute?

08:16.320 --> 08:17.787
I do.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.855
But I'm not sure
this is such a good idea.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.925
I know. My campaign manager
would kill me if he knew.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.521
But, uh, let's
live dangerously.

08:25.570 --> 08:28.596
Before James Castro left
the race, he gave me this.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.868
What is it?
It's dirt.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.559
On you, your husband,

08:31.610 --> 08:33.168
your children,
your family.

08:33.210 --> 08:34.632
I haven't opened it.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.829
He wanted me to
use it against you.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.108
But I won't.

08:39.210 --> 08:41.314
I want to do this differently.

08:41.350 --> 08:43.545
I want to not pound
you into submission.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.989
And I don't want
you to pound me.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.908
I've heard politicians
in the past agree

08:46.960 --> 08:48.655
they won't go negative,
and they always

08:48.690 --> 08:50.123
go negative, and
I think I know why.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.252
Because it works?

08:51.290 --> 08:53.554
No, because it's a posture.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.953
They don't mean it
when they say it.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.628
Otherwise they'd go to
the other candidate,

08:57.670 --> 08:59.262
not the press.
That's why I'm here.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.961
I'm not going to the press.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.004
I'm coming to you to say
I will not go negative.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.076
And I'm asking you
to do the same.

09:07.110 --> 09:09.943
Now, my campaign manager,

09:09.980 --> 09:12.073
if he were here, Frank,

09:12.110 --> 09:15.011
would say you're up
three points in the polls.

09:15.050 --> 09:17.939
Of course you want to suspend
negative campaigning.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.287
Yeah, but...

09:19.320 --> 09:21.208
you must have the
same projections I do.

09:21.260 --> 09:22.682
The race will tighten.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.027
You have women voters,

09:24.060 --> 09:25.618
I have African-Americans.

09:25.660 --> 09:28.220
You have Catholics,
I have limousine liberals.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.091
That's a flipped-coin of a race.

09:30.130 --> 09:32.166
I like betting.
I wouldn't bet on it.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.691
Wouldn't you rather win
without bloodying

09:34.740 --> 09:35.764
each other in the process?

09:35.800 --> 09:36.960
I don't have
an opinion on that.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.238
I doubt that.

09:38.270 --> 09:40.329
That's your right.

09:41.810 --> 09:43.641
This is my number.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.102
My private cell number.

09:45.150 --> 09:47.141
My campaign manager
doesn't even have it.

09:47.180 --> 09:49.171
Whenever you want
to talk, call me.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.312
You shouldn't give me that.

09:50.350 --> 09:51.749
I know.

09:51.790 --> 09:52.950
But there it is.

10:04.970 --> 10:06.164
You're not my enemy, Alicia.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.667
I know.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.702
I'm your opponent.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.901
Call me.

10:12.940 --> 10:14.009
No handlers involved.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.632
No political ops.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.773
Just us.

10:17.810 --> 10:20.074
(door opens)

10:20.120 --> 10:22.076
(door closes)

10:22.120 --> 10:24.384
(elevator whirrs quietly)

10:29.220 --> 10:31.120
(door clacks, rattles)

10:46.710 --> 10:49.235
(rock music playing, muffled,
in a distant apartment)

11:11.170 --> 11:13.195
(phone rings,
Cary sighs)

11:13.240 --> 11:14.867
Yeah?

11:14.900 --> 11:16.162
KALIN DA:
Cary, it's me.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.861
I'm in your apartment.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.400
Okay, he's in.
Come on up.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.000
Kalinda.
You're not supposed to be here.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.200
Look, just
five minutes.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.740
I've hired you

11:24.780 --> 11:26.304
a bodyguard.
I'm fine.

11:26.350 --> 11:28.215
This FBI tap is fake.
Bishop couldn't have

11:28.250 --> 11:29.808
been home when the FBI
said they taped it.

11:29.850 --> 11:31.408
November 13, Cary,
he wa home.

11:31.450 --> 11:32.781
He came back a day
early from Florida.

11:32.820 --> 11:34.219
I have the flight
confirmation.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.784
(knocking at door)

11:35.820 --> 11:37.458
Who is that?
It's your
bodyguard.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.366
KALINDA:
Hey, Carter, how
are you doing?

11:43.400 --> 11:45.163
CARTER:
Good. You want me in?
KALINDA: Yeah.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.088
Cary, this is Carter Grayson.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.437
He's, uh...
Yeah, I know.

11:48.470 --> 11:50.233
Milwaukee Bucks._
Marquette Univer5ity, right?

11:50.270 --> 11:51.237
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:51.270 --> 11:52.430
Nice to meet you, Cary.

11:52.470 --> 11:54.028
So he's gonna stay here
with you tonight

11:54.080 --> 11:55.331
and then escort you
to work in the morning.

11:55.380 --> 11:56.779
CARTER: You mind if
I check your bedroom?

11:56.810 --> 11:57.947
I already did.

11:57.980 --> 12:00.710
Is this
the only exit?
Yeah.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.242
Kalinda, how much
is this costing?
Don't worry.

12:05.290 --> 12:07.019
The firm is absorbing it
for a week.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.254
I worked on it.

12:09.290 --> 12:10.450
Thank you.

12:10.490 --> 12:14.051
Hey, I want to see you alive.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.091
(distant sirens wailing)

12:27.440 --> 12:29.908
NARRATOR (on TV):
His pain is your pain.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.804
His troubles are your troubles.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.408
They call him the "Gorilla Boy"

12:33.450 --> 12:34.849
and he'll steal your h--

13:01.840 --> 13:03.876
(sighs)

13:28.200 --> 13:30.566
(breathing deeply)

13:39.580 --> 13:42.048
(keys beeping)

13:43.420 --> 13:46.241
(line ringing)

13:46.290 --> 13:48.155
This is Peter.

13:48.190 --> 13:49.384
It's me.

13:49.420 --> 13:50.557
Alicia?

13:50.590 --> 13:52.581
What's wrong?

13:54.060 --> 13:56.551
Nothing.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.591
I, um...

14:01.500 --> 14:05.106
I need you to do a joint
interview with me tomorrow.

14:05.140 --> 14:08.928
To stop any questions
about our marriage.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.174
Sure. Um...

14:10.210 --> 14:12.542
I have an opening at 6:00.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.038
NARRATOR:
No one knows how it started.

14:33.070 --> 14:35.129
Ego? Boredom?

14:35.170 --> 14:36.592
Money?

14:36.640 --> 14:38.961
(deep thudding, booming)

14:45.410 --> 14:46.570
And then he was there,

14:46.610 --> 14:48.578
on the horizon,

14:48.620 --> 14:50.645
rearing his head.
(screams)

14:50.690 --> 14:52.282
I do think traditional values

14:52.320 --> 14:54.049
should be part of the debate.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.024
I think the Republicans
are right on this.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.288
The law is unfair...

14:58.330 --> 14:59.456
That'll be darker, grainier.

14:59.490 --> 15:01.458
And then he showed
his true face.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.627
D-I-N-O.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.490
Democrat in Name Only.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.088
(Marissa laughs)

15:07.140 --> 15:08.596
Great.
The body woman is entertained.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.460
Alicia, he used
to be a Republican.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.636
He changed
parties in 2007.

15:11.670 --> 15:13.069
It goes to values.

15:13.110 --> 15:15.078
Yeah... but a dinosaur?

15:15.110 --> 15:17.249
(laughing)
JOSH: You have to be noisy

15:17.280 --> 15:19.168
to attract eyes on the Internet.
This is noisy.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.313
The courthouse shooting
is noisy,

15:20.350 --> 15:22.238
but you said
"no" to that.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.486
NARRATOR:
And then he's home.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.341
Transforming back.

15:26.390 --> 15:28.358
The DINO hiding his true self.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.221
If he hides this,

15:31.260 --> 15:33.399
what else is he hiding?

15:33.430 --> 15:36.991
Uh, is this suggesting
what I think it was suggesting?

15:37.030 --> 15:38.998
Not in any way that
can't be denied.
You're saying
he's closeted?

15:39.030 --> 15:40.463
No.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.990
He put his dinosaur
costume in a closet.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.268
That's all.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.538
He was married.
And divorced.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.003
Ten years ago.
He's never gotten remarried.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.133
Oh, my God.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.738
You really think
we should show this?

15:49.780 --> 15:51.338
I think
it's fair game.

15:51.380 --> 15:53.268
It's not about Frank Prady
being closeted,

15:53.320 --> 15:54.617
it's about him
being inauthentic.

15:54.650 --> 15:56.015
He is a closeted

15:56.050 --> 15:57.688
Republican.
JOSH:
We have two guys

15:57.720 --> 15:59.278
who will swear he had
affairs with them.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.617
So?

16:00.660 --> 16:02.582
So... be gay, then.

16:02.620 --> 16:04.281
No one... no one's stopping you.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.150
But don't pretend to be,
you know, blah-blah-blah,

16:06.190 --> 16:08.624
when you're not.
What do I know?

16:08.660 --> 16:09.695
I'm the body woman.

16:09.730 --> 16:10.697
Oh... Okay.

16:10.730 --> 16:12.595
I'm sorry, guys,

16:12.630 --> 16:14.336
but we can't use this.

16:16.140 --> 16:18.165
Could we talk?
Uh, just the two of us.

16:18.210 --> 16:21.179
Sure, fire me.
You'd be doing me a favor.

16:21.210 --> 16:22.507
MARISSA:
I'll get you some milk.
I don't need milk.

16:24.610 --> 16:27.545
Prady came to my work yesterday.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.478
He brought me this.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.081
It is oppo research
Castro had on us.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.179
In a shoebox?
Yes.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.720
But he's not going to use it.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.591
He asked me to agree
not to go negative.

16:40.630 --> 16:42.052
Prady said that?
Yes.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.590
Good. He's scared.
No, I think he's trying

16:43.630 --> 16:45.097
to do the right thing.
He's three points ahead.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.189
He's trying to freeze things
in place.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.491
Why are you talking
to him anyway?

16:48.540 --> 16:50.064
He came to me.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.806
I think_he wants to run
a p05itive campaign.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.535
Alicia, he's trying to get
in your head.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.332
Usually, it happens
handler to handler.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.608
"Let's back-channel,"

16:57.650 --> 16:59.538
and then you get
fed bad information.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.070
Did you look in there?

17:02.550 --> 17:04.689
No.
Good. Don't.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.608
'Cause whatever they really
have, they'll use it.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.083
They always do. Did you
speak to the governor yet?

17:08.120 --> 17:09.280
Yes.
Okay.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.480
And what about the dinosaur?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.088
Oh, come on.

17:12.130 --> 17:13.495
It's stupid.
That's on
purpose.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.589
It makes it sticky.
People remember it.

17:15.630 --> 17:18.292
I don't want to be remembered
for a closeted dinosaur.

17:18.330 --> 17:19.797
Why don't you
leave that with me?
No, I've got it.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.058
Alicia, leave it with me.

17:21.100 --> 17:22.192
Don't let him get in your head.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.164
He won't.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.171
This feels weird.

17:32.510 --> 17:35.741
It's just for the first day.

17:35.780 --> 17:38.146
So you just stay in
my office, or...?

17:38.190 --> 17:39.214
That's the idea.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.251
(elevator bell dings)

17:54.200 --> 17:56.293
Cary, hello.

17:56.340 --> 17:58.228
Mr. Bishop, hello.

17:59.810 --> 18:01.277
How are
you doing?

18:01.310 --> 18:04.279
I'm... fine.

18:04.310 --> 18:06.676
M_AN: Hello there.
Nice to meet you.

18:06.710 --> 18:10.316
Ian Gatins, Gatins & Brauer.
I'm Mr. Bishop's new lawyer.

18:10.350 --> 18:13.387
Are you in the
meeting, too?
Uh, no. What meeting is that?

18:13.420 --> 18:14.557
Mr. Bishop.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.114
Hello.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.151
I, uh, I didn't know
you'd be here for this.

18:18.190 --> 18:20.158
I guess I should have
called first.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.451
Everyone's
surprised I'm here.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.694
No, no, no. We're just...

18:22.730 --> 18:24.266
Oh, Cary, hi.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.665
Hi. Ian Gatins.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.395
Gatins & Brauer.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.307
Well, good to see
you, Mr. Bishop.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.205
And you.

18:34.210 --> 18:35.871
DIANE:
Um...

18:35.910 --> 18:38.401
shall we, um, talk in
the conference room?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.418
CARY:
Kalinda.

18:40.450 --> 18:41.542
Bishop is here for a meeting.

18:41.580 --> 18:42.547
KALIN DA:
Where's "here"?

18:42.580 --> 18:44.184
At work.

18:44.220 --> 18:46.745
But he saw me with Carter.

18:46.790 --> 18:48.314
You heard me, right?

18:48.360 --> 18:49.486
Yeah.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.589
It might not be a problem.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.756
It is a problem.

18:51.790 --> 18:52.859
He saw I was worried about him.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.198
He'll think I flipped.

18:54.230 --> 18:55.458
No.
CARY:
Yes.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.626
Where are you?

18:56.660 --> 18:57.866
I'm working on the wiretap.

18:57.900 --> 18:59.891
Uh, let me get
back to you, okay?

19:02.470 --> 19:03.630
Was that your friend?

19:03.670 --> 19:04.932
Yeah.

19:04.970 --> 19:06.335
_He confronted me
in front of my boss.

19:06.370 --> 19:07.735
Said I was sleeping with you.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.736
It put me in
a precarious position.

19:09.780 --> 19:12.408
You're talking about someone
that might be murdered.

19:12.450 --> 19:14.179
That's the real
precarious p05ition.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.949
Unless the tape is faked.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.811
He thinks it's faked?
You want Cary
to turn on Bishop,

19:17.850 --> 19:19.215
and you just happen
to play a tap

19:19.250 --> 19:20.387
of Bishop threatening him?

19:20.420 --> 19:21.648
It's not faked, Kalinda.

19:21.690 --> 19:23.521
And you should tell him
to watch out.

19:23.560 --> 19:24.720
Okay, then let me have it.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.318
What?
The tape.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.952
If it's real, let me go
to one of my sound guys

19:28.000 --> 19:30.321
to see if
it's real.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.190
I'll give you the report

19:32.230 --> 19:33.538
from one oHr technicians.
o.

19:33.570 --> 19:35.367
You want Cary to turn on Bishop,

19:35.400 --> 19:36.890
you let me check the tape
out for myself.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.778
(blues music playing)

19:42.810 --> 19:45.244
*

19:45.280 --> 19:46.804
PRADY:
You're wondering
ifI can be trusted.

19:47.880 --> 19:51.281
I'm wondering about
a lot of things.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.311
Your campaign has
oppo research on me?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.954
Some.
Let me guess.

19:55.990 --> 19:58.754
They're going to use the
rumors that I'm secretly gay

19:58.790 --> 20:00.519
to make it seem like
I can't be trusted.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.949
Yes.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.820
It'll be effective and
probably cost me...

20:04.870 --> 20:06.269
five points.

20:07.570 --> 20:09.697
I have the same
oppo research on you.

20:09.740 --> 20:11.367
My handlers
want to wait

20:11.410 --> 20:13.332
until you use the
courtroom shooting

20:13.380 --> 20:15.632
to humanize yourself
and then we'll leak

20:15.680 --> 20:18.274
that you were, in fact,
sleeping with your boss.

20:21.780 --> 20:23.714
No.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.718
I told you I won't
go negative, Alicia.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.854
And I won't.
Well, if you don't,
your PAC will.

20:27.890 --> 20:30.017
But that's why
I gave you my number.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.324
If my PAC does something
that angers you, call me.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.555
What will that do?
Maybe nothing.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.967
Maybe I'll take my
PAC publicly to task

20:38.000 --> 20:39.695
and they won't
do it again.

20:39.730 --> 20:42.494
I'm not a martyr.

20:42.540 --> 20:44.269
I just think I can
win a fair fight.

20:44.310 --> 20:47.939
So I want it
to be fair.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.505
*

21:01.860 --> 21:04.328
(indistinct conversations)

21:06.490 --> 21:07.718
Alicia. Hey.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.819
So the governor's
not here yet.

21:09.860 --> 21:11.862
But what we want out of this
is comfort and affection.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.663
Any physical contact

21:13.700 --> 21:16.464
between the two of you
would be good.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.808
RAMONA:
Hello, Alicia.
How are you?

21:17.840 --> 21:19.831
Ramona. Hi.

21:21.510 --> 21:22.670
I'm on with
the entourage.

21:22.710 --> 21:23.870
They're just
pulling up now.

21:23.910 --> 21:25.070
Great.

21:25.110 --> 21:26.748
So how do you like
working with Peter?

21:26.780 --> 21:27.974
Quite a bit.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.544
It's very
challenging.
Yeah.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.445
A lot of late nights.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.718
Yeah.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.354
(laughs)

21:34.390 --> 21:35.880
I guess that's true.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.979
Oh, here.
I almost forgot.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.884
It's the demo you asked about.

21:39.930 --> 21:41.488
Uh-huh.

21:41.530 --> 21:42.758
(phone beeps off)
(quietly): Okay...

21:42.800 --> 21:45.963
Uh... uh, you played the drums.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.365
(laughs gently)
I know.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.731
A lifetime ago.

21:48.770 --> 21:49.998
We thought we'd be
the next Sleater-Kinney.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.462
(laughs)

21:51.510 --> 21:52.761
Oh, here he is.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.778
Hello, everyone.

21:54.810 --> 21:55.777
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.978
Everything good?
Ramona?

22:00.010 --> 22:01.409
It's good.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.815
Good. Let's do this.

22:02.850 --> 22:05.910
(clears throat)
JOHNNY:
All right, everybody ready?

22:05.950 --> 22:06.939
(sighs)

22:09.090 --> 22:10.955
(Ramona whispering
indistinctly)

22:10.990 --> 22:12.981
PETER (whispering):
I know.

22:14.430 --> 22:16.057
Legal advice.

22:16.100 --> 22:19.422
Ah. It's always important
to stay legal.

22:19.470 --> 22:20.789
Okay, can we get a level
from both of you?

22:20.840 --> 22:21.932
Yes, I'm glad to be here

22:21.970 --> 22:23.608
and I want to thank
the president

22:23.640 --> 22:25.528
and the first lady
for having us.
(all chuckling)

22:25.570 --> 22:27.106
JOHNNY:
Uh, Alicia.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.676
Five, four, three,
two, one!

22:28.710 --> 22:30.405
That's a little loud,
but okay.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.940
Ready.

22:31.980 --> 22:34.119
Governor, Alicia, how long
have you been married?

22:34.150 --> 22:36.414
Ah, I knew that'd be
your first question.

22:36.450 --> 22:37.849
20 years.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.846
20 years of married bliss.

22:41.590 --> 22:42.955
JOHNNY: And how did
you two first meet?

22:42.990 --> 22:43.979
You want to tell him?

22:44.030 --> 22:46.954
(laughs):
No. You.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.821
It was a party
in Georgetown.

22:48.860 --> 22:52.466
They were playing some kind of
funny, uh, Newlywed Game...

22:52.500 --> 22:54.968
Dating Game.
Right-- and, um...

22:55.000 --> 22:57.036
I was a contestant.

22:57.070 --> 22:58.765
Believe it or not,
she didn't pick me.

22:58.810 --> 23:01.973
Well, in my defense, he was
doing a Mickey Mouse voice.

23:02.010 --> 23:04.672
Yeah, we all had to put on
these... silly voices.

23:04.710 --> 23:06.575
I saw him afterwards.

23:06.610 --> 23:09.909
It was raining out,
and he offered to take me home.

23:09.950 --> 23:11.679
You kept my jacket,
if I remember correctly.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.712
No, you gave me
your jacket.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.011
Peter got all wet
in the rain.

23:16.060 --> 23:17.084
PETER: Mm-hmm.
ALICIA: And we had to run.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.553
It was coming down
so hard.

23:18.590 --> 23:19.818
We ran under a bus stop.

23:19.860 --> 23:23.125
And... he put his arm
around me.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.696
I was a real smooth
operator then.

23:24.730 --> 23:26.493
(chuckles)

23:26.530 --> 23:28.998
I don't think I had ever had
a happier moment in my life.

23:32.510 --> 23:34.705
JOHNNY: So, let's talk
about your children.

23:34.740 --> 23:37.504
Yeah, uh, Zach's
a freshman in college.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.848
Georgetown University.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.041
It's a little far from home,
but great college. Uh...

23:42.080 --> 23:44.116
Grace, straight-A
student.

24:06.910 --> 24:08.707
Hey.

24:09.710 --> 24:11.143
Oh. Hi.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.171
Sorry, I thought...
I thought you'd gone.

24:13.210 --> 24:15.178
_ No... _
well, just for a minute.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.142
First year law firm.

24:17.180 --> 24:18.818
I have to work
really long hours.

24:19.850 --> 24:22.159
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

24:22.190 --> 24:24.055
Nothing. I'm just...

24:25.930 --> 24:28.922
Just want... I wanted
to see how you were domg.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.758
I'm good. Thanks.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.097
You want to sit down?

24:33.130 --> 24:35.667
Um...

24:35.700 --> 24:37.031
Ah... (chuckles)

24:37.070 --> 24:38.503
Sorry.

24:38.540 --> 24:41.077
Somewhere underneath
all this is a couch...

24:41.110 --> 24:43.670
for sitting.

24:43.710 --> 24:45.905
So I've been bored
out of my mind.

24:45.950 --> 24:48.578
Three DUI's,
one petty theft and--

24:48.620 --> 24:50.941
ooh!-- mail fraud.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.787
Ha, ha.
Oh, yeah.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.151
(both chuckling)

24:56.090 --> 24:57.978
(groans, sighs)

25:02.960 --> 25:04.496
(sighs)

25:07.070 --> 25:08.731
Did you want to talk?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.831
No, I don't.

25:13.270 --> 25:14.703
Yeah, I'm fine sitting.

25:14.740 --> 25:15.900
(quiet laugh)

25:22.050 --> 25:24.041
I...

25:26.050 --> 25:27.210
You...

25:29.320 --> 25:31.083
Uh, this is stupid.
It was good seeing you.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.085
What was stupid?

25:32.130 --> 25:33.324
I don't know.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.749
Just even being.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.529
Hey...

25:39.830 --> 25:41.593
(man and woman
chatting, laughing)

25:41.640 --> 25:43.631
MAN:
Lovely.

25:43.670 --> 25:44.637
POLMAR:
Hey!

25:44.670 --> 25:46.206
Working late.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.878
Yeah.
Yeah.

25:47.910 --> 25:49.878
My cellmates.

25:49.910 --> 25:52.140
Mm-hmm.

25:52.180 --> 25:54.614
Alicia.

26:01.390 --> 26:02.914
Tell your friend.
It's real.

26:05.190 --> 26:06.589
Look-- thank you.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.855
I want you to take this
more seriously.

26:09.900 --> 26:13.119
If the tap is real...
No. You.

26:13.170 --> 26:15.866
I want you to take me
more seriously.

26:15.900 --> 26:17.128
Lana".
No.

26:17.170 --> 26:19.764
If this is just
nothing to you,

26:19.810 --> 26:23.029
then don't come by
here tonight, okay?

26:23.080 --> 26:25.674
There are other people that
I wouldn't mind seeing.

26:26.950 --> 26:29.316
(door opens, closes)

26:29.350 --> 26:30.908
(applause)
PETER: Thank you!

26:30.950 --> 26:32.178
Hey, thanks.
I really appreciate it.

26:32.220 --> 26:34.188
Thank you very much.

26:34.220 --> 26:36.188
Looked good.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.858
Not too much wind.

26:37.890 --> 26:39.084
I'll see you back
at the office.

26:40.960 --> 26:43.053
PETER: You did great
with the police chief.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.897
He's in Castro's pocket,
by the way.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.189
I thought the interview
went well...

26:50.240 --> 26:52.037
You need to stop
sleeping with her.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.673
I'm not saying that
because I'm jealous.

26:56.710 --> 27:00.669
I'm not saying that because
our agreement is void.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.938
I'm saying that
because you've been seen.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.345
I don't understand.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.711
Who are we
talking about?

27:06.750 --> 27:08.183
Because I have
n0idea.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.121
You need to stop
sleeping with her.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.127
I'm not.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.718
Peter, do me the honor

27:16.760 --> 27:18.296
of being honest for once.
I had

27:18.330 --> 27:19.820
dinner with her.
If your photographer

27:19.870 --> 27:21.690
had stayed around
another week,

27:21.740 --> 27:23.731
he would've seen_me
havmg dinner With
other staff members.

27:23.770 --> 27:26.000
It's what I do.
Were you sleeping with her
in Highland Park?

27:27.010 --> 27:28.705
I'm not sleeping with her now.

27:28.740 --> 27:30.708
I was pregnant with Grace.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.047
Were you
sleeping with her then?

27:32.080 --> 27:33.308
Alicia, listen to me:

27:33.350 --> 27:36.114
I will do nothing
to embarrass you.

27:36.150 --> 27:38.141
These weren't taken by me.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.385
You think I give a crap,
enough to follow you?

27:40.420 --> 27:42.911
They were taken by
another campaign.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.757
They're gonna use this
against me.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.018
And you.

27:46.060 --> 27:48.790
And I won't stand
beside you.

27:48.830 --> 27:52.129
Not again, Peter.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.468
Not in a million years.

27:54.500 --> 27:57.139
So... don't listen to me,

27:57.170 --> 28:00.003
keep lying to me,
I don't care.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.736
But_|i_sten_ to_
your political instincts.

28:02.780 --> 28:04.145
You want to be re-elected.

28:04.180 --> 28:06.671
You want me to be elected.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.476
Then zip up your pants,
shut your mouth,

28:09.520 --> 28:11.147
and stop banging the help.

28:13.990 --> 28:15.150
JOHNNY:
...some for later.

28:15.190 --> 28:16.452
Alicia. Good.

28:16.490 --> 28:18.321
We're ready to go.
Tell her.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.248
JOHNNY:
Yes. We need to go with
the courthouse shooting.

28:20.290 --> 28:22.349
It's just too good.
And Josh

28:22.400 --> 28:23.799
threatened to quit if we didn't.

28:23.830 --> 28:24.865
Use it.
I'm ready.

28:27.070 --> 28:28.298
G-Good.

28:28.340 --> 28:31.138
Um... you look great.

28:31.170 --> 28:33.206
I... like your
hair that way.

28:33.240 --> 28:35.037
I do, too.
Let's do it now.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.105
All right, you heard her!
Let's go, come on!

28:39.050 --> 28:40.142
ALICIA:
I was shocked.

28:40.180 --> 28:41.249
I wasn't _used
to politics,

28:41.280 --> 28:42.440
and suddenly I was forced

28:42.480 --> 28:43.845
into the middle of it.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.415
With my husband in prison,

28:46.450 --> 28:47.986
what could I do?

28:48.020 --> 28:50.056
I went back to work.

28:50.090 --> 28:52.957
I had to work harder
than anybody

28:52.990 --> 28:54.423
and then I had to go home

28:54.460 --> 28:56.348
and hold my kids.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.324
I got the call at a speech

28:59.370 --> 29:01.395
I was giving for Peter.

29:02.870 --> 29:04.838
My friend was dead.

29:04.870 --> 29:08.101
Will Gardner hired me

29:08.140 --> 29:10.506
when no one else would.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.475
And here was more gun violence.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.114
I felt...

29:18.150 --> 29:20.243
destroyed.

29:20.290 --> 29:21.552
MAN: We're not saying
he flipped, Lemond,

29:21.590 --> 29:23.410
but the cops smell blood here.

29:23.460 --> 29:24.859
MAN 2:
We're seen as weak.

29:24.890 --> 29:26.255
BISHOP:
Then what do we do?

29:26.290 --> 29:28.121
He's a white lawyer.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.526
(loudly): I'm not saying
it's real or faked,

29:30.560 --> 29:32.892
but there are no edits.

29:32.930 --> 29:34.534
Is it Bishop's voice?

29:34.570 --> 29:36.037
Get me a tape on him,
I'll tell you positively.

29:36.070 --> 29:37.139
When do you need it?

29:37.170 --> 29:38.307
Now.

29:38.340 --> 29:39.898
Kalinda...
I love you.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.305
I would anything for you,

29:41.340 --> 29:42.898
but I can't bend space and time.

29:42.940 --> 29:44.544
Try.

29:47.180 --> 29:48.511
That was interesting,
last night.

29:48.550 --> 29:49.869
I know.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.547
I'm sorry, I was...
in a weird mood.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.410
And the mood is gone?

29:53.450 --> 29:55.111
The mood is... worrisome.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.286
And why is that?

29:56.320 --> 29:58.857
Because I'm...

29:58.890 --> 30:00.027
I don't know.

30:00.060 --> 30:01.254
I wish things were simpler.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.188
Things can be simpler.

30:03.230 --> 30:05.425
You just need to...
want them to be.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.994
I don't think that's true.

30:07.030 --> 30:08.338
People have expectations.

30:08.370 --> 30:10.190
Which people?

30:13.210 --> 30:16.805
I always hated that
these offices were glass.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.941
Okay, I'm gonna go now.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.440
(phone rings)

30:23.480 --> 30:26.040
This is Alicia.
Hi. We have a problem.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.183
I would expect nothing less.

30:28.220 --> 30:30.927
Prady put out
his ten-minute video.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.327
(someber
My dad...

30:34.360 --> 30:37.056
he was everything to me.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.965
A musician.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.161
Genius. He, uh...
(clears throat)

30:41.200 --> 30:42.929
*

30:42.970 --> 30:45.302
And then on my 16th birthday...

30:45.340 --> 30:48.104
(indistinct radio chatter)

30:48.140 --> 30:51.109
Nice work, not too sappy,
good photos--

30:51.150 --> 30:52.469
someone knows what
they're domg over there.

30:52.510 --> 30:54.068
And here she
is again.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.111
I don't get it--
why are you guys worried?

30:56.150 --> 30:57.617
It's coming up.
Eat some potato chips.

30:57.650 --> 30:59.618
No, I'm fine.
Eat them.
They're good.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.380
PRADY:
I went from my birthday party
right to the hospital.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.251
Uh, I saw him.

31:04.290 --> 31:08.124
I held his hand...
when he was rolled in.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.128
I know it was hard on Frank,

31:10.160 --> 31:12.264
seeing someone die
in front of him.

31:12.300 --> 31:13.528
Uh-oh.

31:13.570 --> 31:15.162
That's my dress.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.168
JOSH: _
Yep. You are wearing
the exact same dress

31:17.200 --> 31:18.303
as Prady's mom.
MARISSA:
Uh-oh.

31:18.340 --> 31:19.409
Maybe nobody'll notice.

31:19.440 --> 31:20.532
What, are you, eight?

31:20.570 --> 31:22.674
Everyone
will notice!

31:22.710 --> 31:25.270
Josh, we have to redo the
interview in a new dress.

31:25.310 --> 31:26.971
Well, can't you guys
digitally, you know,

31:27.010 --> 31:28.318
do whatever it is you do?

31:28.350 --> 31:29.578
The first thing
we tried. Look.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.549
Ow.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.319
Hurts my eyes.
JOSH: We tried

31:33.350 --> 31:34.612
dark, too.
(Alicia sighs)

31:34.660 --> 31:36.287
Damn, I have to redo

31:36.320 --> 31:37.924
this interview.
Which is too bad,

31:37.960 --> 31:39.985
'cause it was great.
Can you get it back?

31:40.030 --> 31:41.691
Sure. I mean, I can try.

31:41.730 --> 31:43.527
I'll go change.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.323
Well, I was shocked.

31:47.370 --> 31:48.689
Terribly shocked.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.004
Politics was new to me,

31:51.040 --> 31:54.134
and suddenly
there was this scandal.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.000
And then I had to be home

31:56.040 --> 31:57.632
with my kids.
"Had to be"?

31:57.680 --> 32:01.172
It sounds like
a punishment.
Right.

32:03.150 --> 32:04.549
I was shocked.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.387
Truly, truly shocked.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.559
Terribly shocked.

32:08.590 --> 32:10.148
I know.
I got this.

32:10.190 --> 32:12.181
Mm-hmm.
Just wait.
(clears throat)

32:15.400 --> 32:17.356
I was shocked.

32:17.400 --> 32:21.268
All I could think about was
my kids, being home with them.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.431
Which I wanted to be...

32:24.470 --> 32:27.007
because...

32:27.040 --> 32:29.702
child services said I had to.
(groans)

32:29.740 --> 32:32.049
I know._
Just... wait.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.308
(clears throat)

32:33.350 --> 32:35.318
Well, I was shocked
at the scandal.

32:35.350 --> 32:37.568
Politics was new to me...

32:37.620 --> 32:39.986
and all I could think about
was my...

32:40.020 --> 32:42.409
(Southern accent):
poor, lovely little kids
at home.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.428
(laughter)

32:44.460 --> 32:46.587
Okay. Shake it off.

32:46.630 --> 32:49.326
Right. Yeah. I know.
Just do it

32:49.360 --> 32:51.464
like you did
it before.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.195
(sniffles)

32:54.370 --> 32:56.190
I'm sorry.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.333
(sniffles)
No. I'm sorry.

32:58.370 --> 33:00.258
I hate being
the cause of this.

33:00.310 --> 33:03.199
You're not the cause.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.741
I should resign.
No.

33:04.780 --> 33:06.509
Could you
please pull over?

33:06.550 --> 33:08.518
Ramona, Ramona, wait.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.260
We're bad people.

33:27.330 --> 33:29.298
I know.

33:45.450 --> 33:47.441
I need to stop being afraid.

33:47.490 --> 33:49.481
Do you have an opinion
on that?

33:51.490 --> 33:53.720
People sometimes have
a reason to be afraid.

33:53.760 --> 33:57.355
Do I?

33:57.400 --> 33:58.822
I don't know.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.135
My worry is fear is creating
the reason to be afraid.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.809
I don't have an opinion
about that.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.502
I need to talk
to Bishop.

34:07.540 --> 34:10.771
Look, I don't think
that's a good idea.

34:10.810 --> 34:13.301
Phone Kalinda first.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.608
You said "phone"--
phone Kalinda?

34:16.650 --> 34:17.844
Yeah.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.484
Most people in America,
they say "call."

34:19.520 --> 34:20.487
Did you know that?

34:20.520 --> 34:21.589
Makes sense.

34:21.620 --> 34:23.258
You call someone.

34:23.290 --> 34:24.757
Right, Bishop said "call."
In reception, he said,

34:24.790 --> 34:25.779
"I guess I should've called."

34:25.830 --> 34:27.127
Okay.

34:27.160 --> 34:28.297
On the wiretap,
he said "phone."

34:28.330 --> 34:30.093
"Phone me when you have a plan."

34:30.130 --> 34:31.097
I didn't hear it.

34:31.130 --> 34:32.097
He said "phone."

34:32.130 --> 34:33.427
Mm, people say both.

34:33.470 --> 34:35.165
No, not usually.

34:35.200 --> 34:37.361
Are we betting
your life on "usually"?

34:37.400 --> 34:39.630
I've been betting my life
on a lot less these days.

34:39.670 --> 34:41.228
I'm not a gambler,
but it's amazing

34:41.280 --> 34:42.429
how prison
makes you one.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.368
What are you doing?

34:44.410 --> 34:45.638
I'm going to
see Bishop.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.669
That's not smart.

34:46.710 --> 34:47.870
Bishop saw you.

34:47.910 --> 34:49.309
He thinks I turned against him.

34:49.350 --> 34:51.409
I need to convince him
that I haven't.

34:51.450 --> 34:53.418
I need to do this.

34:53.450 --> 34:55.111
MAN:
* So inciting *

34:55.160 --> 34:56.479
* Colin Sweeney in her bed *

34:56.520 --> 34:57.851
* So exciting *

34:57.890 --> 34:59.755
* Bishop ends up
there instead *

34:59.790 --> 35:00.654
* So enlightening *

35:00.690 --> 35:02.351
* St. Alicia loves them all... *

35:02.400 --> 35:03.492
This is online?

35:03.530 --> 35:04.724
With a minimum
late-night media buy.

35:04.770 --> 35:05.896
They sent it
out to press.

35:05.930 --> 35:07.761
It will get some play.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.234
It's crude,
but effective.

35:10.270 --> 35:12.158
Their tag-line is intended
to be repeated.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.472
That's awful.

35:15.510 --> 35:17.330
This is his campaign
or his PAC?

35:17.380 --> 35:18.677
His PAC, but you know
they're coordinating.

35:18.710 --> 35:19.779
We're not with our PAC.

35:19.810 --> 35:20.845
We could.
But we're not.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.474
JOHNNY: We want to use
the closeted dinosaur ad.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.919
They went negative first.

35:24.950 --> 35:26.918
I'd do it,
he deserves it.
No.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.282
His PAC went negative
first, he didn't.

35:29.320 --> 35:32.926
Alicia, I'm starting to like
you, but you're new to this.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.928
You think you're bringing
something new to campaigning,

35:34.960 --> 35:36.757
but there is nothing
new under the sun.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.927
Let us help
you win this.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.234
Even the nutty lady thinks
you should hit back.

35:41.270 --> 35:43.238
Thank you for the "nutty lady,"
but he's right.

35:43.270 --> 35:45.261
How's my introductory
ad coming?

35:46.840 --> 35:48.808
And Will was dying.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.274
ALICIA:
I got a call about Will dying.

35:51.310 --> 35:52.800
It was awful.

35:52.850 --> 35:54.408
Just awful.
Ouch.

35:54.450 --> 35:55.519
Yeah, it's not good.

35:55.550 --> 35:56.448
We need to use the dinosaur ad,

35:56.480 --> 35:57.447
or we're gonna lose this.

35:59.350 --> 36:01.318
(door closes)

36:01.360 --> 36:03.351
You know, at some point,

36:03.390 --> 36:06.325
the candidate is the candidate,
the manager is the manager.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.225
Are we at that point?

36:08.260 --> 36:09.488
ALICIA:
Where are we?

36:09.530 --> 36:11.259
What's going on?

36:11.300 --> 36:12.597
It's not me, it's my PAC.

36:12.630 --> 36:13.699
At a certain point,
that doesn't matter.

36:13.730 --> 36:14.697
I've been hit.

36:14.740 --> 36:15.695
I know.

36:15.740 --> 36:16.798
Let me see what I can do.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.464
Do it.

36:19.510 --> 36:20.465
Give me a day.

36:20.510 --> 36:22.569
A day is a year in politics.

36:22.610 --> 36:24.601
JOHNNY:
Yeah, we saw the ad.

36:24.650 --> 36:25.901
It's outrageous.

36:25.950 --> 36:27.303
Alicia no longer
represents Lemond Bishop.

36:27.350 --> 36:28.578
And her firm only represents

36:28.620 --> 36:29.848
Colin Sweeney's
business interests.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.745
MAN: Is that a quote?
It is a quote.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.439
How are you planning
to hit back?

36:33.490 --> 36:35.879
Well, we had a plan, but
Mrs. Florrick intends to rise

36:35.920 --> 36:37.581
above the negativity.
MAN: What do you mean?

36:37.620 --> 36:39.485
I mean I had a devastating ad
on Frank Prady

36:39.530 --> 36:41.521
designed by Josh Mariner.
MAN: The king of slice and dice?

36:41.560 --> 36:43.653
That's right, the king of
slice and dice, himself.

36:43.700 --> 36:46.225
Alicia was worried that
it was too hot to handle.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.567
MAN: Slip it to me, John.
Can't do it.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.363
Come on, I won't say
where it comes from.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.459
And I'll give you prominent
placement for your next release.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.501
No, this one can never get out.

36:56.810 --> 36:57.879
Okay, sit down.

36:57.910 --> 36:59.468
Can you just give it
to me, please?

36:59.510 --> 37:01.444
Kalinda, sit down there,
or you don't get anything.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.947
Okay, you asked
me to look...

37:02.980 --> 37:05.540
Howell, I know what I asked you,
can you just tell me?

37:05.590 --> 37:07.581
Do you want me to start again?

37:07.620 --> 37:09.019
No, God, please, no.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.755
You gave me the other
wiretaps of Lemond Bishop,

37:10.790 --> 37:12.883
so I compared the
vocal characteristics.

37:12.930 --> 37:14.557
Good,
is the wiretap fake?

37:14.600 --> 37:16.420
I compared both
the timbre...
Howell.

37:16.460 --> 37:17.427
Just tell me.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.428
The wiretap is authentic.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.290
The FBI isn't faking anything.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.398
Bishop wants your lawyer killed.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.358
Don't you want
a rundown...?

37:26.640 --> 37:27.607
Cary?

37:27.640 --> 37:28.607
Where are you?

37:28.640 --> 37:31.905
I'm at Bishop's.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.906
Well, what are you doing there?

37:33.950 --> 37:35.474
Get out.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.771
The tape is real.

37:36.820 --> 37:38.811
Bishop wants you dead.

37:44.890 --> 37:47.552
Cary? Where are you?
CARY: I'm at Bishop's.

37:47.590 --> 37:48.955
Get out.
The tape is real.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.820
Bishop wants you dead.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.728
Where's Carter?

37:58.770 --> 38:00.306
Not here.

38:00.340 --> 38:01.568
He's in the car.

38:01.610 --> 38:02.838
I had him wait there.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.472
DYLAN:
Do you know Rat-a-Tat-Cat?

38:06.910 --> 38:08.047
I will call you back, Kalinda.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.342
Get out of there, Cary.

38:09.380 --> 38:11.348
You get four
cards each.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.379
It's really good,
it's about memory

38:15.020 --> 38:16.510
Cary?

38:18.530 --> 38:20.725
No. No, that's okay.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.523
Good.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.926
You take two cards and you
look at them and you remember.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.028
Actually, Dylan, that was work.

38:26.070 --> 38:27.321
I need to go.

38:27.370 --> 38:29.895
You don't
want to play?

38:29.940 --> 38:31.635
BISHOP: Okay,
that was pointless.

38:31.670 --> 38:33.331
DYLAN: Dad! You
want to play, too?

38:33.370 --> 38:34.530
More than two
people can play.

38:34.580 --> 38:37.378
No, uh, maybe later.

38:37.410 --> 38:38.604
Cary and I
have to talk.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.742
No, we can do it later.

38:39.780 --> 38:41.338
That's okay.

38:41.380 --> 38:43.416
Dad, I just
dealt his cards.

38:43.450 --> 38:45.486
I know,
and Cary wants to play.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.817
But maybe later.

38:46.850 --> 38:48.613
Mr. Bishop,
I just got a call from work.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.651
Cary, I need a minute.

38:50.690 --> 38:51.827
And I wish I had time.

38:53.860 --> 38:55.748
Dylan,

38:55.800 --> 38:58.496
Cary can play
Rat-a-Tat-Cat afterwards.

38:59.630 --> 39:01.598
All right.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.834
Bye, Cary.

39:02.870 --> 39:04.064
Bye, Dylan.

39:07.810 --> 39:09.778
Why do you have
a bodyguard, Cary?

39:09.810 --> 39:12.472
Oh, the firm gave me one.

39:12.510 --> 39:15.343
Why did they give you one?

39:23.590 --> 39:27.082
The FBI played us a tape
of you threatening to kill me.

39:31.570 --> 39:34.539
And I came here without
a bodyguard to tell you

39:34.570 --> 39:36.367
I am not a threat to you.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.005
When did they
play this?

39:39.040 --> 39:41.008
Two days ago.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.008
And you believed it?

39:43.040 --> 39:46.703
I thought it was fake,
but I wasn't sure.

39:46.750 --> 39:48.741
Is it faked?

39:51.790 --> 39:53.018
No.

39:58.590 --> 40:00.888
I talk, Cary.

40:00.930 --> 40:02.750
I talk all the time.

40:02.800 --> 40:06.065
I say things
I don't mean.

40:06.100 --> 40:09.069
I'm sure you say things
you don't mean, too.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.829
Sometimes.

40:12.110 --> 40:15.637
_ "I want this
Situation gone."

40:15.680 --> 40:18.843
"I want that person
to shut up."

40:18.880 --> 40:20.438
It's blowing
off steam.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.675
Afterwards, I
talk sensibly.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.449
So, it's
all just talk.

40:24.490 --> 40:25.445
Yes.

40:25.490 --> 40:26.718
Hmm.

40:26.750 --> 40:27.910
Hmm.

40:29.590 --> 40:30.955
You won't turn
on me, right?

40:30.990 --> 40:32.150
No, I won't. Ever.

40:32.190 --> 40:33.555
Good.

40:33.590 --> 40:35.592
Then I have no
issue With you.

40:37.230 --> 40:39.198
The bodyguard
had me worried.

40:39.230 --> 40:41.198
Well, it wasn't my idea.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.790
Good.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.728
Then that's that.

40:48.910 --> 40:51.208
Dylan wanted me to play.

40:53.150 --> 40:55.141
I'll tell him
you had to go.

40:57.780 --> 41:00.180
Cary.

41:02.520 --> 41:03.919
Don't hurt me...

41:05.190 --> 41:07.181
...and I won't hurt you.

41:13.900 --> 41:15.891
KALINDA:_
You're good? Meaning you're
not in the house anymore?

41:15.940 --> 41:17.168
Yeah, I'm in the car.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.906
Bishop didn't try anything?

41:18.940 --> 41:21.158
No, we talked.
Everything's good.

41:21.210 --> 41:23.906
So he didn't say it?

41:23.940 --> 41:25.646
The tape wasn't him?

41:25.680 --> 41:27.671
No, it was him,
but he didn't mean it.

41:29.650 --> 41:31.049
What the hell, Cary?

41:31.080 --> 41:33.913
I have to go.

41:47.100 --> 41:49.091
I take you seriously.

41:51.240 --> 41:55.028
It's not
easy, but...

41:55.080 --> 41:57.105
I take you seriously.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.809
Good.

42:04.850 --> 42:05.987
MAN:
D-I-N-O.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.715
ALICIA:
How did that get online?

42:07.750 --> 42:09.012
I don't know. _
We're getting calls about it,

42:09.060 --> 42:11.278
but I didn't
leak it.

42:11.320 --> 42:14.027
Don't look at me, I
agreed to bury it.

42:14.060 --> 42:16.597
Don't do that again.
I didn't do
anything, Alicia.

42:16.630 --> 42:18.962
You kept telling the press
it was hot stuff.

42:19.000 --> 42:19.989
It was.

42:20.030 --> 42:21.736
Jon. Don't.

42:21.770 --> 42:23.237
And go with
the first interview.

42:23.270 --> 42:25.306
I don't care that my dress
matches his mother's.

42:25.340 --> 42:27.001
PRADY: _
So you're getting

42:27.040 --> 42:28.166
back at me?
No.

42:28.210 --> 42:30.178
My commercial was from my PAC.

42:30.210 --> 42:31.848
Yours was from your campaign.

42:31.880 --> 42:33.745
Mine was a leaked commercial,

42:33.780 --> 42:35.179
never meant for broadcast.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.108
Leaked by whom?
I don't know.

42:37.150 --> 42:38.640
But someone from your campaign?

42:38.690 --> 42:40.681
That's my guess.

42:44.060 --> 42:46.324
They're gonna drag us
into the pit, Alicia.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.282
I know.

42:48.330 --> 42:51.128
Then what do we do?

42:51.160 --> 42:52.718
Resist.

42:52.770 --> 42:54.761
(soft chuckle)

42:56.300 --> 42:58.609
*

42:58.640 --> 43:01.006
(Josh speaking indistinctly)

43:05.050 --> 43:07.348
HARPER:
Lana. Hello.

43:07.380 --> 43:09.143
Come on in.

43:09.180 --> 43:11.148
So we have
a complication here, Lana.

43:11.180 --> 43:13.887
It seems the Bishop wiretap
was leaked.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.388
We just have a few questions
for you.
