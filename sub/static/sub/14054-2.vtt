00:02.440 --> 00:04.670
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- You gotta have a plan.

00:04.840 --> 00:05.955
Yeah. Right.

00:06.120 --> 00:09.510
- Who are you?
- I stole a car. Crashed it.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.069
Then my mom threw me out.
So Mr. Cohen took me in.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.595
- You brought him home? 
- What do you guys do around here?

00:14.760 --> 00:17.593
- What do you think of Newport?
- I can get in less trouble where I'm from.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.115
- You have no idea.
- Shouldn't her boyfriend do this?

00:20.280 --> 00:22.475
Sure they're not doing anything
we didn't do.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.234
- My dad's not here.
- It's just a thing with a client.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.799
- Put him down.
- Hey, Ryan.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.558
- Welcome to the O.C., bitch.
- I don't want this kid in my house.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:52.000 --> 00:55.595
Guys, come on. Out of the pool.
Dinner's almost ready.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.116
Dad, I know.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.677
I understand how important the model
home is to the new development.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.756
We'll sell the lots by Christmas,
I promise.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.838
Okay. Bye.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.592
I wish there was more we could do.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.638
Honey, you're his lawyer,
not his guardian.

01:20.800 --> 01:24.475
I know. In the morning
I'll take him to Child Services.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.911
What kind of mother
just abandons her child?

01:32.680 --> 01:35.513
- What happens if they don't find her?
- He'll go into the system.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.558
Foster care till he's 18.
I mean, they'll try and place him...

01:38.720 --> 01:41.996
...but at his age it'll be impossible.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.430
You know what I was thinking?

01:54.120 --> 01:57.396
This being your last night and all,
we should do something special.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.512
I don't know what.

01:59.680 --> 02:04.071
Possibly get a couple of tattoos or some
hookers and lose our virginity, right?

02:04.920 --> 02:09.390
Okay, dude, there's a shark movie
at the IMAX if that's what you're into.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.912
I think I just want to take it easy.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.955
How was your swim?

02:22.120 --> 02:23.792
It was great.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.632
What's that?

02:26.360 --> 02:28.590
It's a model home.

02:30.720 --> 02:34.156
I build them.
Well, the real ones, not that one.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.958
Can you build me one?

02:37.920 --> 02:40.195
Sorry. Bad joke.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.713
Thanks.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.988
So...

02:51.160 --> 02:53.116
...the last supper, huh?

02:54.520 --> 02:56.192
Sorry. Bad joke.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.237
It's just a laugh riot around here.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.755
- This all looks really good.
- Too bad you're leaving.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.310
- We never eat like this.
- That's not true. I cook all the time.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.833
Dad.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.514
I'm sorry, honey.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.469
Let's just eat.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.876
We're not saying
we want you to cook more.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.793
- Remember the meat loaf incident of '98?
- That was brisket.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.952
Yeah, that's my point exactly.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.796
As your attorney, I'll cosign these forms.

03:26.960 --> 03:31.272
They basically say that you don't have
a legal parent or a guardian available.

03:31.440 --> 03:35.433
So I'm now property of the
government, nickname 0382965.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.433
Hey, it's better than "Death Breath Seth."

03:38.600 --> 03:40.318
Or so I would imagine.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.908
So we'll meet with your social worker
in the morning...

03:44.080 --> 03:48.631
...and she'll be the one
to take you to the group home.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.278
My contact at Child Services got you in
with only two other kids, which is good.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.989
- It can get crowded.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.358
And, you know...

03:59.520 --> 04:01.988
...they do find foster homes
for kids your age.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.833
Yeah, because everybody wants
a brand-new teenager.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.960
I'm sorry if I'm the only one
that'll state the obvious...

04:09.120 --> 04:11.554
...but we have all this extra room.
We have a pool house.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.190
Yet you guys are gonna ship him off
to a group home? Am I the only one...

04:15.360 --> 04:18.875
...who gets how much that sucks?
- It's okay. Really.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.556
Good luck with it. It looks perfect.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.833
- Good night.
- Good night.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.154
Hey, how about a little...

05:51.320 --> 05:53.276
...PlayStation perhaps?

05:53.440 --> 05:56.352
- Are you running away?
- Go back in the house, Seth.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.636
Hey, you can't just run away.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.236
What are you thinking?
What about Child Services or my dad?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.116
Okay, then wait.
I want to come with you.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.396
Know what I've always wanted to do,
besides sail to Tahiti? That Kerouac thing.

06:11.560 --> 06:15.155
Hit the road, stop at diner to diner,
the pancake tour of North America.

06:16.520 --> 06:17.794
- No.
- Fair enough.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.520
- Where you going?
- I don't know.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.631
New town, get a job, save some money.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.756
Great plan.
You've given it a lot of thought.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.751
Got a better idea?

06:30.320 --> 06:32.311
Actually, I do.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.078
Seth?

06:50.640 --> 06:52.790
Can I talk to you?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.832
Dad?

06:57.560 --> 07:00.836
- What, is it morning?
- You're asleep?

07:01.760 --> 07:04.115
Yeah, I was. What's going on?

07:04.520 --> 07:06.192
Well...

07:06.360 --> 07:07.873
...I wanted to talk about Ryan.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.270
Yeah, I know. It's cool.
We don't need to discuss it.

07:10.440 --> 07:14.592
I think we do. I know you're upset,
your mother and I are upset.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.115
But our responsibility is to our family.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.113
It's okay. I get it.
This is a person's life we're talking about.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.635
We need to leave it
in the hands of the authorities.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.473
- There's no need for sarcasm.
- I'm not being sarcastic.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.071
Well, it's hard to tell sometimes.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.231
Dad?

07:30.400 --> 07:32.868
It's okay. Really.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.792
- When you want to talk about it...
- I know. You're the one to talk to. Got it.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.279
Good night.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.549
- Good night.
- Night.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.998
Come on, Seth.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.916
Okay, got it. I'll be there in,
like, 20 minutes.

08:10.160 --> 08:12.958
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.915
I didn't think I'd see you again.

08:17.560 --> 08:20.154
Look, I wanted to say thanks
for the other night.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.911
You always drink like that?

08:25.880 --> 08:30.192
- I thought you left.
- I did. I am.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.796
Ryan. Ryan, I'm all set. Ready?

08:34.880 --> 08:36.472
Hi there, Marissa.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.359
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. We're just hanging out.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.592
Look, it's somebody's birthday.
My invitation got lost in the mail.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.796
It's my friend Summer's birthday.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.076
Summer's birthday is not till Wednesday.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.116
That's what I heard.
I don't know. I guessed.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.475
You guys are up to something.

08:52.880 --> 08:56.395
- Dude, what did you tell her?
- I didn't tell her anything.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.549
Maybe the black turtleneck in August
tipped her off.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.633
Okay, I was going for stealth.
Also, it's slimming.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.234
We should really go.
Have fun at your party.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.312
You should probably be off.
The Newport social scene awaits.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.111
Oh, yeah?

09:15.200 --> 09:18.795
Why won't you tell me where we're
going? This is pretty far away.

09:18.960 --> 09:23.272
Oh, wow, complaining. That's interesting,
considering nobody invited you.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.716
Before I came along
you were on a skateboard.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.791
- You like them?
- Yeah, I guess.

09:34.960 --> 09:38.191
- Well, what do you like?
- Everything.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.636
I don't know,
I don't really listen to music.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.560
- Dude, that's kind of weird.
- Why? What do you like?

09:44.120 --> 09:46.588
Right now, punk.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.830
Avril Lavigne doesn't count as punk.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.915
What about the Cramps?
Stiff Little Fingers. The Clash. Sex Pistols.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.756
I listen to the same music
as Marissa Cooper?

09:57.920 --> 10:00.832
- I think I have to kill myself.
- You listen to punk, huh?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.672
I'm angry.

10:04.280 --> 10:05.872
That's it right there.

10:11.080 --> 10:14.356
- Looks scary.
- Then you can stay in the car.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.030
Do you recognize this place, Ryan?

10:20.200 --> 10:21.918
- This isn't...
- Where are we?

10:22.080 --> 10:24.594
Well, it's one of my mom's
housing developments.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.593
Her and my grandpa own a bunch
of them. This is supposed to be...

10:27.760 --> 10:30.991
...the model home,
but it never got finished.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.789
Why? Did someone die here
and now it's haunted?

10:33.960 --> 10:35.757
Yes. That's exactly what happened.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.718
- What did happen?
- I don't know.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.235
<i>How do contractors just disappear?</i>

10:41.400 --> 10:44.870
If we don't have a model home,
we don't have a new development.

10:45.440 --> 10:49.513
It's been a month.
I'm not waiting for you guys anymore.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.677
- You know where to reach me.
- No luck with the contractors?

10:54.840 --> 10:56.239
Vanished.

10:56.680 --> 10:59.638
My father's never gonna
let me hear the end of this.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.750
Did you...? Did you talk to Seth?

11:04.800 --> 11:06.836
I think so. Don't blame yourself.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.835
I'm not blaming myself. But how can I
allow a strange boy to live in this house?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.275
Seth needs to know
it's what any mother would do.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.711
I was talking about the contractors.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.350
So you want him to stay here?

11:25.520 --> 11:28.592
Well, I mean, I know the place
needs some sprucing up, but...

11:28.760 --> 11:31.593
God, did I just say "sprucing"?

11:31.760 --> 11:33.671
So, Ryan, what do you think?

11:33.840 --> 11:35.751
I haven't really had time to think.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.309
But how much better is this place
than some group home?

11:38.480 --> 11:40.675
And wait till you see the best part.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.198
- It's an empty pool.
- To some people.

11:54.800 --> 11:59.316
So your mom... I mean,
she has to come back, right?

11:59.480 --> 12:03.758
I don't know.
My mom's kind of a train wreck.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.669
So's mine.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.193
What about your dad?
Can you call him?

12:13.360 --> 12:16.557
Dad's in jail. Armed robbery.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.034
Impressive, huh?

12:23.720 --> 12:28.840
My dad, he's, like, a financial planner.
And I think he's in trouble.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.551
I don't have any stock tips.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.631
He stopped going to the office.

12:35.800 --> 12:39.759
And these guys keep showing up
at the door, like cops.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.150
But he won't answer.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.717
- Look, I haven't told anybody that.
- I can keep a secret.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.353
- Hey.
- <i>Where you at, girl?</i>

12:57.520 --> 13:00.193
It's time for you to get your buzz on.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.595
Nordlund is so faded
he can't even feel his feet.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.955
There goes the left leg!

13:06.280 --> 13:09.352
I miss you, babe. You know
it's not a party without you.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.511
- Oh, you're sweet.
- <i>What's the deal?</i>

13:11.680 --> 13:13.432
<i>You were supposed to be here</i>
<i>an hour ago.</i>

13:13.600 --> 13:15.511
Okay, I'll be there soon.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.513
Say hi to everyone.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.350
All right. Love you.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.592
Love you too.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.594
Bye.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.430
So how long you been with him?

13:38.600 --> 13:40.158
Luke?

13:40.680 --> 13:42.272
- I don't know, really.
- I know.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.150
Fifth grade, when you two
got your mack on...

13:45.320 --> 13:48.517
...during our class trip to the
Museum of Tolerance, back of the bus.

13:48.680 --> 13:49.669
Classy lady.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.355
You know what?
What's your problem, Cohen?

13:52.600 --> 13:54.830
- I mean, what did I ever do to you?
- Nothing.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.788
I've lived next door to you forever, and
you've never done or said anything to me.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.630
Oh, my God. You're the one
who never talks to me.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.836
You think you're so much better
than everyone.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.672
I do?

14:07.240 --> 14:10.357
Well, if you're talking about Luke,
then, yes...

14:10.520 --> 14:12.954
...because that guy shaves his chest!

14:14.360 --> 14:15.679
He plays water polo.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.434
We know. Half the team
tried to kill us the other night.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.516
I'm not too popular around here.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.113
And your boyfriend...

14:23.280 --> 14:24.349
...a little bit angry.

14:24.520 --> 14:28.433
- You didn't try to hit him back?
- Actually, I hit him first.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.558
Well, hard to believe
you're not more popular.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.228
I thought this could be your room.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.748
I still don't know if it's a good idea
for me to stick around.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.876
You should stay.

14:45.880 --> 14:50.271
- Okay. For a little while.
- So when she says it, you listen?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.798
- Hey, Summer.
- Hey, is that Summer?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.309
- Tell her I said happy birthday.
- Okay.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.789
Coop, where are you?
We're coming to get you.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.030
Oh, no, don't. I'm coming.

15:04.200 --> 15:08.034
- Tell her I said happy birthday.
- Seth Cohen says happy birthday.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.953
- Who?
- She says thanks.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.199
Look, I gotta go. Okay. Bye.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.436
I gotta go meet my friends.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.633
My other friends.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.756
I should get back too
and protect my cover.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.913
But wait. Listen. We have to promise
not to tell anyone about this place, okay?

15:28.080 --> 15:31.231
Now, Ryan's not going to, obviously,
and I could get grounded.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.073
So that leaves Marissa.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.356
I can keep a secret.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.596
Okay. See you tomorrow.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.191
Me too. We'll fix this place up.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.396
- Cool.
- I'm telling you, Ryan...

15:49.600 --> 15:51.511
...this plan is foolproof.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.358
Ryan?

16:10.600 --> 16:12.830
Hey, Ryan? You ready?

16:28.920 --> 16:32.674
Okay, the key here is not to panic.
Do you have your supplies?

16:32.840 --> 16:36.196
Yeah, but there are cops at your house.
Do you think it's safe?

16:36.360 --> 16:39.591
I'll handle Johnny Law, unless...
Are you losing your nerve?

16:39.760 --> 16:40.954
Meet me in the driveway.

16:44.760 --> 16:48.389
He couldn't have gotten far.
We'll search the neighborhood.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.030
Seth, I was just gonna get you.
We gotta talk about Ryan.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.239
Marissa, look who's here.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.069
- Luke, hi.
- Hey.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.992
Just grabbing a little grub
before we take the boat out.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.593
Boat?

17:08.760 --> 17:10.512
I thought we'd take my dad's Donzi.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.433
Do a little waterskiing,
have a little lunch.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.556
So you have no idea
where Ryan might have gone?

17:22.720 --> 17:24.153
I don't know.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.470
He did say something about
going down to Mexico...

17:26.640 --> 17:29.200
...and gambling on cockfights.
I mean, I don't know what...

17:29.360 --> 17:31.510
Quit joking. Answer his question.

17:31.680 --> 17:36.754
Yes, I did. I really don't know. I do not
know the guy. I never got the chance.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.149
Hey, there's eggs.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.673
Oh, I'm taking Kaitlin to the stables,
so I need that check.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.678
Does Kaitlin really need a pony?

17:46.840 --> 17:49.195
In a couple months,
she's not even gonna like horses.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.193
What? I love China.
She's the prettiest pony.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.509
We're not giving up China.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.513
Wait in the car, sweetie.
Mommy will be right with you.

18:01.760 --> 18:05.150
Jimmy, all this work
is making you so tense.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.992
Look, I gotta...

18:07.160 --> 18:08.957
I've gotta talk to you
about work.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.680
You know I don't like to talk
about work.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.912
Yeah, well, I've made...

18:15.080 --> 18:17.071
...a few mistakes...

18:17.240 --> 18:18.878
...and I don't know really...

18:19.040 --> 18:22.032
Jimmy, you don't have cancer.
No one is dying.

18:22.200 --> 18:26.239
Whatever it is, whatever you've done,
I'm sure you'll fix it.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.437
Can you write that check?
I don't want Kaitlin to be late. Okay?

18:30.960 --> 18:34.350
It's just, Suki is amazing. It doesn't
hurt at all when she's waxing you.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.112
It's really hard to get an appointment.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.635
Why don't you get a manicure?
You could come with me.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.995
I mean, they're not just for girls.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.390
You go. We'll catch up later.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.278
Holly's having a...

18:46.120 --> 18:48.111
- Holly's having a thing.
- Perfect.

18:56.040 --> 19:00.750
- So did you tell him anything?
- No. But if anyone asks, you're Suki.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.118
So you didn't tell them anything?

19:05.280 --> 19:08.989
Actually, I told them you went
to Mexico for cockfights.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.991
You know what,
even if they don't believe me...

19:11.160 --> 19:12.991
...they'll never look for you here.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.474
- Did you seriously bring a loofa?
- What's a loofa?

19:17.640 --> 19:19.596
You said bring whatever
was around the house.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.116
But I meant, like, survival supplies,
like rope or muskets...

19:23.280 --> 19:27.512
...and not Kiehl's cucumber moisturizer.

19:32.680 --> 19:35.672
- That's a pretty good call.
- That's nice.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.759
Hey.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.951
Here's a little bit of everything.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.232
Let your education begin.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.475
This place is perfect.
Seriously, it's totally safe.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.108
Ryan, how perfect is this place, right?

19:59.280 --> 20:02.511
- What else could you need?
- Anyone bring any food?

20:03.520 --> 20:06.114
Food. Guess we're going on a mission.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.232
Faster! Come on!

20:49.560 --> 20:53.758
Call me if someone meeting that
description comes in. Thank you.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.195
- Nothing at the hospitals.
- I'm sure he'll turn up.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.078
I think Seth knows where he is.

20:58.240 --> 21:02.438
Are you accusing him of lying?
That'll be good for your relationship.

21:02.600 --> 21:06.309
- Let the police handle this.
- I wish you hadn't called the police.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.789
They don't have the resources
or the manpower.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.473
Ryan will slip through the cracks.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.631
Sandy, how many of these cases
have you seen...

21:12.800 --> 21:15.360
...have passed across your desk?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.274
What is it about this kid?

21:22.120 --> 21:25.669
I thought I could help him,
make a difference.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.796
I was this kid.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.676
If someone hadn't helped me...

21:32.520 --> 21:34.397
...I wouldn't be here.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.958
Hello?

21:47.280 --> 21:51.034
- How are you?
- I'm good. I hate to ask, but...

21:51.200 --> 21:53.156
...I need your help with something.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.753
Of course.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.549
China has alopecia.
We need to call the vet.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.876
- Are you free for lunch?
- Yeah.

22:07.040 --> 22:11.079
I have some stuff I need to do for work,
but lunch sounds great.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.798
So, you guys,
I've been thinking about a plan.

22:15.480 --> 22:18.313
You know, right now,
this could very well be...

22:18.480 --> 22:21.119
...the first stop on our pancake tour
of North America.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.953
Like in <i>On the Road?</i>
That's my favorite book.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.078
Mine too.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.473
So here's the deal.

22:29.640 --> 22:33.553
My mom had this boyfriend, he hired me
to work construction last summer.

22:33.720 --> 22:38.157
But then they broke up.
He moved away to Austin.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.079
In Texas.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.710
- He said if I was ever there, look him up.
- Well, I mean...

22:43.880 --> 22:47.668
That's kind of far. We were thinking, like,
Long Beach, so we could still hang out.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.673
I'll need to get a couple days of work
so I can get travel money.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.637
Well, I mean, we can get you money.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.354
Well, I mean, you know,
I guess in a way you're lucky.

23:00.520 --> 23:04.354
You get to move to a new place,
start over, be whoever you want to be.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.954
That's really not so bad.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.074
Hey.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.715
- What's it take to get a menu?
- I'll handle it.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.916
- No, I'll handle it.
- And ruin your popularity?

23:20.080 --> 23:23.470
You know what, why don't you guys
just sneak out the back.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.717
What's going on with you two?

23:28.160 --> 23:30.515
Hey, how's it going?

23:31.840 --> 23:35.310
Oh, it was great. It was really good.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.840
Hey! Front door.

23:44.240 --> 23:47.357
- I was thinking we could go to Holly's.
- Thanks.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.397
- Sounds good.
- Awesome.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.835
So, what did you guys do today?

23:55.800 --> 23:58.837
Hi. How you doing? You like
the food here too? It's pretty awesome.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.797
Shut up, queer.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.357
Well, at least I don't shave my chest.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.431
- What did you say?
- Luke, come on.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.319
I said, you look nice in a sweater vest.
It was a compliment.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.517
- Do you want me to break you, Cohen?
- Hi.

24:12.640 --> 24:15.234
No way. Look who's back.

24:15.400 --> 24:19.188
- You're a little far from 8 Mile.
- Luke, don't.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.318
What are you, like, spokesperson
for Geeks of America or something?

24:22.960 --> 24:25.428
You know what I like about rich kids?

24:26.640 --> 24:27.629
Nothing.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.755
- That was awesome!
- Come here, you punk!

24:30.920 --> 24:32.797
Come on, man! Come here!

24:34.760 --> 24:38.309
Cohen, you're dead meat, man!
You're dead meat!

24:38.480 --> 24:39.879
Go!

24:41.040 --> 24:43.508
Come on, chump! You're dead!

24:51.480 --> 24:53.436
"You know what I like about rich kids?

24:54.320 --> 24:55.594
Nothing. " Hey, Ryan...

24:55.760 --> 24:59.196
...you wouldn't consider me rich, would
you? I'd be more upper-middle class.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.913
What's up, fool?

25:04.680 --> 25:06.716
- You know, you didn't have to hit him.
- Sorry.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.189
You know, the cashier called the cops.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.792
Look, I don't know why
Luke does that.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.235
- Did that. He's just...
- An ass?

25:18.720 --> 25:20.551
Protective.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.991
God, it's my mom.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.794
And your dad.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.437
It's been a while.

25:40.600 --> 25:44.479
I have to figure out
what kind of shape this place is in.

25:50.760 --> 25:54.514
That's what those contractors
have been doing.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.674
This place is fantastic.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.990
- You don't think it's too much?
- Are you kidding?

26:01.160 --> 26:03.469
You're talking to a guy
whose wife just imported...

26:03.640 --> 26:06.950
...ceramic shower-curtain rings
from Morocco.

26:10.240 --> 26:14.074
This is gorgeous,
with the high ceilings and the molding.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.390
It reminds me of...

26:16.560 --> 26:18.516
- Your parents' house.
- On Elm Grove.

26:18.680 --> 26:23.595
With the vaulted ceilings and those
great beams. Remember that?

26:23.760 --> 26:25.796
Yeah. I loved that old house.

26:25.960 --> 26:29.714
Yeah, I loved that place too.
I had my first kiss there.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.518
Me too.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.560
So, what's going on, Jimmy?

26:39.600 --> 26:42.876
I had a really bad year
with the market and...

26:43.040 --> 26:46.919
Well, it was disastrous. It's gonna
be a struggle just to remain solvent...

26:47.080 --> 26:49.196
How much do you need?

26:51.600 --> 26:55.229
It's... It's a lot of money.
It's too much.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.311
Jimmy.

26:58.640 --> 27:02.315
- It's $100,000.
- I'll call the bank.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.512
- No, I can't.
- I can.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.590
I'll pay you back.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.790
But it's gonna take me
a couple of months.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.712
I know where you live.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.630
This place is gonna be perfect.

27:21.120 --> 27:25.272
I hope so. The new contractors come
tomorrow. Better get the job finished.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.876
New contractors.
Sounds like a nightmare.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.996
Pretty much.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.271
Are you okay?

27:41.280 --> 27:43.999
So the contractors start tomorrow.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.669
Guess that means I'm gone.

27:48.560 --> 27:52.633
One bus ticket to Austin,
8 a.m. Tomorrow.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.190
"Would you like to purchase?"

28:02.240 --> 28:05.550
- Hey.
- Hey. We're not knocking anymore?

28:05.720 --> 28:07.438
I'm sorry. What are you doing?

28:07.600 --> 28:09.192
Just busy.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.156
- You're always busy.
- It's the price of fame. I gotta go, Dad.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.197
They found Ryan.

28:16.800 --> 28:20.031
Or spotted someone with his description.
There was a fight by the pier.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.669
Really?

28:21.840 --> 28:23.876
Which means he's probably
still in the area.

28:24.040 --> 28:27.476
We should find him before the authorities
do. Before he gets in more trouble.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.359
Actually, do you need me to go?
I was going somewhere.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.636
Seth, he's your friend.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.798
Yeah, okay.

28:43.320 --> 28:45.311
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.994
So, what's up?
You've been all weird-acting lately.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.798
Yeah?

28:49.960 --> 28:52.030
I don't know, I guess...

28:52.200 --> 28:55.988
Do you ever wonder what your life
looks like through someone else's eyes?

28:56.160 --> 28:59.197
This is what I'm talking about.
What is up with you?

28:59.360 --> 29:01.351
Nothing. It's just...

29:01.520 --> 29:03.988
- Fresh margs!
- This is some weak margarita.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.310
Whatever. You're the lightweight.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.112
- Say it over here.
- I hope your parents never come home.

29:10.280 --> 29:13.272
Let's find that punk's trailer park
and burn it to the ground.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.429
Who that?

29:14.600 --> 29:16.397
That freak from Chino
was up in Luke's grill.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.677
Maybe he's on OxyContin.
OxyContin is gnarly.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.432
I heard he's a total psycho.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.637
He's a little bitch. If I see him again,
I'm gonna beat his ass.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.712
- Run him out of Newport for sure.
- I gotta go.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.311
- Hey, wait up. Where you going?
- I can't be here right now.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.152
- What's the matter?
- You don't know him.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.958
You don't know anything about him.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.630
- He could be anywhere.
- Dad, I'm sure Ryan's fine.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.234
We should try again when it's light out.

29:51.400 --> 29:55.029
- It could be too late by then.
- Maybe he's better off on his own.

29:55.520 --> 29:57.158
What does that mean?

29:59.360 --> 30:01.999
Okay, if we find him, then what?

30:02.160 --> 30:06.392
Then, if he's lucky, he gets to go back
with his mom? I would run away too.

30:07.600 --> 30:12.549
Promise me that you'd never run away,
no matter how bad things may seem.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.871
- Your mother and I will always be there.
- Take it down a notch.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.517
The minute you were born I knew...

30:19.200 --> 30:22.670
...that I would never breathe easy again
without knowing you were safe.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.833
So I'm like asthma?

30:25.000 --> 30:28.788
I'm warning you, you run away,
I'm coming with you.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.670
I guess we can keep looking.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.189
This song reminds me of you.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.398
- I thought you were with Luke.
- I was.

31:05.160 --> 31:08.436
I don't know why I'm here.
I just wanted to see you.

31:10.520 --> 31:14.513
I mean, you're leaving tomorrow,
and what if I never...?

31:14.680 --> 31:16.318
We never...?

31:20.800 --> 31:22.916
Maybe I could spend the night...

31:23.080 --> 31:24.991
...just hang out.

31:30.760 --> 31:32.796
You can't stay.

31:33.600 --> 31:37.036
If you stay, if we spend the night...

31:37.200 --> 31:39.430
- I don't know that I could leave.
- Then don't.

31:39.600 --> 31:44.355
You'll go back to school in the fall,
and I'll just what? Hang around here?

31:44.880 --> 31:47.110
Hiding like some ghost?

31:47.360 --> 31:49.669
The cops find me
and I have to disappear again?

31:56.120 --> 31:58.076
We're from different worlds.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.033
That's not true.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.991
I'm not like you.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.358
Go.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.158
Please.

32:10.640 --> 32:11.959
Go.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.076
Hey, Allen.

32:50.240 --> 32:55.234
I'm good. I know it's late,
but I need to transfer some money.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.716
Sure, I can hold on a sec.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.751
Seth, I'm up here.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.915
You get the bus ticket?

33:31.080 --> 33:32.877
Bus ticket?

33:34.760 --> 33:37.149
You're not going anywhere.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.354
What are you doing here, man?

33:41.520 --> 33:43.556
What are you doing with my girlfriend?

33:44.480 --> 33:46.072
Nothing.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.151
It didn't look like nothing.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.878
Tell me...

33:51.040 --> 33:54.271
...or I'll kill you.
- Then kill me and quit talking about it.

34:19.040 --> 34:22.271
The place is on fire, man.
We gotta go.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.318
Come on!

34:54.800 --> 34:56.677
Let's go, man!

34:56.840 --> 34:58.558
Run.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.191
I thought basketball season was over.

35:16.360 --> 35:19.875
This is ESPN Classic.
They play all old games.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.793
So the Lakers-Pistons. Right?

35:22.960 --> 35:27.351
1986, the finals, game seven.
You remember watching this?

35:27.520 --> 35:30.432
You were pregnant with Marissa
when this was on.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.830
I remember. I was so swollen.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.911
I hated Detroit.

35:35.080 --> 35:37.435
- Isiah, Laimbeer.
- Yeah.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.431
Dumars. Oh, my...

35:39.600 --> 35:43.513
But Worthy, James Worthy,
he saved us. He shot the lights out.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.359
So fantastic.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.355
You know that thing I was trying
to talk to you about?

35:49.520 --> 35:53.354
- Jimmy.
- No, I'm just saying that I took care of it.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.718
- I knew you would.
- You did?

36:00.360 --> 36:04.990
I can't believe I'm old enough to have
watched people play in those shorts.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.358
Hey, Marissa.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.399
Marissa?

36:15.400 --> 36:17.152
I'll go.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.912
Here you go.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.598
Hey.

36:27.960 --> 36:29.996
What's the matter?

36:31.440 --> 36:34.034
What's the matter? Come on.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.589
You can tell me.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.675
Come here. Give me a hug.
Give me a hug.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.753
What's the matter?

36:45.680 --> 36:49.309
You can tell me.
We tell each other everything.

36:51.480 --> 36:52.879
Do we?

37:01.800 --> 37:03.233
Hello?

37:06.120 --> 37:08.111
I'll meet you there.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.874
- Hi.
- Did Marissa come back?

37:20.040 --> 37:22.110
You smell like smoke.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.789
Yeah, we hot-boxed in Nordlund's car.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.520
And didn't invite me?

37:31.480 --> 37:34.074
Dude, that kid was messed up.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.353
- He was breathing.
- I hope so.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.313
I can't believe this.
This house is cursed.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.789
- You the owner?
- Yes, I am. What happened?

37:51.960 --> 37:54.713
Not sure yet. But it looks like
somebody's been living here.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.233
What?

37:57.320 --> 37:58.958
It's my fault.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.953
- You're okay.
- Disappointed?

38:34.880 --> 38:36.836
Where you going?

38:37.640 --> 38:39.517
Don't know.

38:39.680 --> 38:43.832
We both keep our mouths shut,
they may never know it was us.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.830
- What are you doing?
- You're giving me a ride.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.833
I don't know what happened.
I don't know why it burned down.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.719
What was he even doing there?
Why didn't you tell us?

39:01.880 --> 39:03.836
He didn't want to go to a foster home.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.833
He didn't want to leave,
and I didn't want him to leave either.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.958
It's like, you force me to live
amongst these pod people...

39:10.120 --> 39:13.396
...and the first cool person I meet,
you kick him out of the house.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.514
I did the best I could.

39:23.680 --> 39:25.511
So did I.

39:31.560 --> 39:34.757
Come on. The police want to
ask us some more questions.

39:34.920 --> 39:37.150
<i>Dispatch, is there a description...?</i>

39:38.000 --> 39:39.558
Thank you.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.231
Just follow my lead.

39:51.400 --> 39:55.712
You and I need to talk.
And this time I want the truth.

40:25.040 --> 40:28.589
- I'm sorry.
- Ryan Atwood?

40:30.320 --> 40:32.515
We got some questions for you.

40:39.520 --> 40:43.035
- It was an accident.
- Yeah, you were there?

40:48.840 --> 40:50.034
Yeah.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.668
Then we got some questions
for you too.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.759
Officer, I'm Mr. Atwood's attorney.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.992
Please don't ask him any questions
unless I'm present.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.952
Ryan, keep your mouth shut.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.798
You too.
