WEBVTT

00:04.167 --> 00:06.268
What are we doing
tonight, man?

00:06.303 --> 00:08.102
I think there's a
sorority party tonight.

00:08.135 --> 00:10.170
Yeah? Will there
be girls there?

00:10.205 --> 00:12.809
Didn't you just hear what I
said? It's a sorority party.

00:12.844 --> 00:14.885
Good. As long as
there's girls there, man.

00:14.919 --> 00:16.790
I got a lot of
making up to do.

00:16.825 --> 00:18.829
Denise had me pinned
down for way too long.

00:18.863 --> 00:20.801
You gotta relax, man.

00:20.835 --> 00:22.770
We got at least four
more years of this.

00:22.804 --> 00:25.773
Good, 'cause I plan on taking
advantage of all four of those.

00:27.544 --> 00:30.913
Bring it in.
Circle around.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.281
So, I had a dream
last night

00:33.316 --> 00:37.555
that the ncaa is gonna
be on campus in three days

00:37.589 --> 00:41.826
to conduct one of their
random, unannounced drug tests.

00:41.860 --> 00:45.496
And in my dream you guys
passed with flying colors.

00:45.530 --> 00:49.399
In my dream,
you pissed aquafina.

00:49.433 --> 00:52.469
Any questions
about my dream?

00:52.503 --> 00:54.039
No, coach!

00:54.074 --> 00:56.142
Let's make my dream come
true. What do you say, guys?

00:56.177 --> 00:57.611
Yes, coach.

01:00.385 --> 01:03.287
Okay, assfaces,
drug evaluation time.

01:03.321 --> 01:06.559
Raise your hands if you've
done steroids in the last week.

01:08.864 --> 01:10.432
Okay, good.

01:10.466 --> 01:12.201
Now lower your hands

01:12.235 --> 01:15.573
if you've done steroids
and you've done hard drugs.

01:15.607 --> 01:19.813
Good. Now, take a knee
if you have done steroids

01:19.847 --> 01:21.715
but you haven't
done any hard drugs

01:21.750 --> 01:26.054
but you have done
tranquilizers.

01:26.089 --> 01:27.624
We're screwed.

01:27.658 --> 01:29.059
Why, because the whole
team's doing drugs,

01:29.094 --> 01:31.062
or because our team
captain is retarded?

01:31.097 --> 01:32.230
Take your pick.

01:32.265 --> 01:35.335
Raise both hands if you
have done tranquilizers,

01:35.369 --> 01:37.604
you have not done rabies,

01:37.639 --> 01:39.573
but you have done alcohol.

02:13.076 --> 02:14.176
Okay, I'm sure
a lot of you

02:14.211 --> 02:15.678
Are freaking out
about the drug test.

02:15.713 --> 02:18.148
Well, take a chill pill.
They don't test for those.

02:18.182 --> 02:19.650
Wait. I'm not
freaking out.

02:19.684 --> 02:21.219
It's just beer
and weed for me,

02:21.253 --> 02:23.755
So all I need is a whole lot
of water and tartar sauce.

02:23.790 --> 02:27.193
- Tartar sauce? - No, man,
tartar sauce is for coke.

02:27.228 --> 02:29.729
Orange juice and cat
shit... that's for weed.

02:29.764 --> 02:32.600
No, cat shit's for meth.
Tartar sauce is for opium.

02:32.634 --> 02:34.935
Tartar sauce is
for fish sticks!

02:34.969 --> 02:36.237
If you want to beat
the drug test,

02:36.271 --> 02:37.571
There's only one
way to do it.

02:37.606 --> 02:41.575
- It's an oil change.
- What's an oil change?

02:41.610 --> 02:44.512
An oil change consists
of two easy steps.

02:44.546 --> 02:45.913
Step one...

02:45.947 --> 02:48.616
After disinfecting
the tip of your penis,

02:48.650 --> 02:52.820
Gently insert the lubricated
tubing into your urethra.

03:00.063 --> 03:03.867
Then pushing it
down down down...

03:03.901 --> 03:06.236
You will know you've
reached the bladder

03:06.271 --> 03:08.172
Once urine begins
flowing out.

03:12.178 --> 03:13.311
Step two...

03:13.346 --> 03:15.380
Take the syringe
full of clean piss

03:15.415 --> 03:16.749
Anpump it
into the tubing

03:16.783 --> 03:19.585
Until the bladder
is full.

03:20.988 --> 03:23.056
And voila!

03:23.090 --> 03:24.558
Come on, now!

03:24.592 --> 03:26.359
You're oil is changed.

03:26.394 --> 03:28.962
I am not doing that.

03:28.996 --> 03:30.697
Yes you are.
Team ctain rules.

03:30.731 --> 03:33.066
Look, don't drink
or do drugs

03:33.101 --> 03:35.102
For three days.
How hard could it be?

03:35.137 --> 03:36.938
Cleanse.

03:36.972 --> 03:39.641
I love it.
Let's do it!

03:41.544 --> 03:43.045
It's either that or
the oil change, fellas.

03:43.079 --> 03:44.146
Cleanse
sounds good.

03:44.181 --> 03:45.281
Exactly.

03:46.817 --> 03:49.419
Go goats!

03:49.453 --> 03:52.856
All right! Whoo!
Go goats! Yeah!

03:54.758 --> 03:56.125
That was
great, Sammy!

03:56.160 --> 03:57.693
- Thank you, girls!
- You're the best!

03:57.728 --> 03:59.395
That's why I like
hanging out with you guys!

04:01.699 --> 04:04.200
What's...

04:04.235 --> 04:06.202
All right, Kara!

04:06.236 --> 04:08.071
Not now, Sammy.

04:08.105 --> 04:10.773
- What's the problem? -
There's no problem. It's just...

04:10.808 --> 04:13.009
You're a lot more huggable
when you're the goat.

04:13.043 --> 04:15.978
Yeah, you're so cute in that
costume. When you take it off,

04:16.012 --> 04:18.279
It just kind
of ruins things.

04:18.315 --> 04:22.385
Okay, so, let me get this
straight... this is okay?

04:22.419 --> 04:24.787
It makes me want to snuggle you.

04:24.822 --> 04:26.790
All right. Okay.

04:26.824 --> 04:28.925
And this...
Not so much?

04:28.960 --> 04:31.762
No. It makes me wish
you were someone else.

04:34.700 --> 04:38.670
All right, girls,
hugs! Oh, man!

04:47.682 --> 04:50.250
So what do we do now?
Do we talk to each other?

04:50.285 --> 04:52.186
What do we do?

05:00.394 --> 05:02.663
Oh, hey, guys,
quick question.

05:02.697 --> 05:05.966
I'm gonna go to the grocery
store and get some tartar sauce.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.567
Do you guys want
any tartar sauce?

05:07.601 --> 05:10.770
No? No. It's cool.

05:12.106 --> 05:13.906
Keep doing what
you're doing, losers.

05:15.909 --> 05:17.977
Harmon, seriously,

05:18.011 --> 05:19.578
you couldn't
wait three hours?

05:19.612 --> 05:22.514
It's cleanser. It's just
how I prefer to take it.

05:22.548 --> 05:23.815
Does it do anything?

05:23.849 --> 05:27.317
I feel pretty lightheaded
right now, yeah.

05:31.756 --> 05:33.222
Yeah, get
in there.

05:33.257 --> 05:34.957
You know
what we need?

05:34.992 --> 05:37.093
We need a
ridiculous party.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.563
Ay, here's the plan...

05:39.597 --> 05:41.498
We party,
but we stay sober.

05:41.533 --> 05:43.401
If one of our teammates
gets in trouble,

05:43.435 --> 05:44.869
It's our duty
to save him.

05:44.903 --> 05:46.303
Right?

05:46.338 --> 05:47.839
We can do this.

05:47.873 --> 05:49.107
Bring it in!
Let's do this!

05:49.141 --> 05:51.977
- One, two, three!
- Go goats!

05:56.349 --> 05:58.050
This is
a bad idea.

05:58.085 --> 05:59.519
I don't think I've
ever experienced

05:59.553 --> 06:01.054
A goat house
party sober.

06:01.088 --> 06:02.222
It's almost
depressing.

06:02.256 --> 06:04.758
It doesn't
have to be, man.

06:04.793 --> 06:08.363
See, me, I'm focusing my mind on
which one of these lovely ladies

06:08.397 --> 06:12.200
Is gonna get the Craig
Shilo lunchbox tonight.

06:12.235 --> 06:14.936
Craig, I think you should put
the brakes on a little bit.

06:14.971 --> 06:18.874
You just got out of a
long, sexless relationship.

06:18.908 --> 06:21.343
Okay, I get it.

06:21.377 --> 06:23.511
I'm single now and you
can't handle the competition.

06:23.546 --> 06:24.879
No, that's
not it at all.

06:24.914 --> 06:26.281
I just can't
stand hearing you

06:26.315 --> 06:27.783
Talk about going down
on women all the time.

06:27.817 --> 06:29.985
This isn't
so bad.

06:30.019 --> 06:31.487
I feel terrific!

06:31.521 --> 06:33.489
It's the dawn of
a brand-new day, boys.

06:36.559 --> 06:37.659
Oh shit!

06:37.694 --> 06:40.662
Yep! Brand-new day!

06:42.265 --> 06:47.202
Okay, that looks like a
lunchbox situation right there.

06:47.237 --> 06:50.839
Will you stop?
God!

06:50.874 --> 06:53.242
Sammy, what
are you doing?

06:53.276 --> 06:54.910
It's the new me, Alex!

06:54.945 --> 06:56.045
Isn't it hot
in there?

06:56.079 --> 06:57.480
Not as hot as
it's going to be

06:57.514 --> 07:00.049
Once I get these
girls in here.

07:01.251 --> 07:02.385
I finally
figured it out.

07:02.419 --> 07:04.420
Every weekend
I wear this costume,

07:04.454 --> 07:07.090
And I'm loved by hundreds
of thousands of people.

07:07.124 --> 07:09.558
The mistake I make is that
for the rest of the week

07:09.593 --> 07:13.163
I take it off and I'm just
regular Sammy. Not anymore.

07:13.197 --> 07:15.665
I'm the goat from
this moment on!

07:15.699 --> 07:17.901
Hey, you ladies want to
take a bath with me?

07:17.935 --> 07:19.369
Sure!

07:19.404 --> 07:20.704
Well, let's go!

07:26.078 --> 07:27.612
- Hey.
- Hi!

07:27.646 --> 07:28.746
How's it going?

07:28.781 --> 07:32.317
It's going.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.922
Great weather
we're having, huh?

07:36.956 --> 07:39.958
I'm sorry. It's been a long
time since I've actually

07:39.993 --> 07:41.526
talked to a girl sober.

07:43.061 --> 07:45.597
So, do you want to go
somewhere and get high?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.175
Oh, good times!

08:12.552 --> 08:15.453
Yes, sir. And
that's my lunchbox.

08:15.487 --> 08:17.788
Hello, I'm Jerry Kincaid
from the NCAA.

08:17.823 --> 08:19.257
Piss in this cup,
please.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.025
What are you doing?

08:21.059 --> 08:24.228
It's a prelim. There's no way you
assholes stayed clean last night.

08:24.263 --> 08:26.163
We didn't even
do anything.

08:26.198 --> 08:29.500
If you didn't do
anything, piss in the cup.

08:29.535 --> 08:31.469
Okay, fine!

08:31.503 --> 08:33.938
I might have had a
tiny little bit of weed.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.339
Well well well.

08:35.374 --> 08:37.708
The truth
finally comes out.

08:37.743 --> 08:38.809
Right.

08:38.844 --> 08:41.145
This is not a game!

08:41.179 --> 08:46.084
This is important
team business, okay?

08:46.119 --> 08:49.021
Anybody else have
anything to confess?

08:49.055 --> 08:53.191
All right, I might have
eaten a pot brownie.

08:53.226 --> 08:54.860
Or five.

08:54.894 --> 08:58.797
I did some uppers.
And then I did some downers.

08:58.831 --> 09:01.533
And then I
chased the dragon.

09:01.567 --> 09:03.168
I'm not proud of that.

09:03.202 --> 09:04.302
That settles it, then.

09:04.337 --> 09:06.071
You have no time
to dry out.

09:06.105 --> 09:07.839
That leaves
just one option.

09:07.873 --> 09:09.741
We're doinoil changes.

09:09.775 --> 09:11.742
Hold on, hold on!

09:11.777 --> 09:14.011
We're not doing
oil changes, all right?

09:14.046 --> 09:15.246
He're's what
we're gonna do.

09:15.280 --> 09:18.416
- We get pvacs.
- What are pvacs?

09:18.450 --> 09:20.985
They're fake dicks,
all right?

09:21.019 --> 09:23.921
The NCAA spotters, they can't
even tell the difference.

09:23.956 --> 09:26.324
We piss through these
fake dicks with clean piss

09:26.359 --> 09:27.459
and then it all
comes out clean.

09:27.493 --> 09:29.561
Whoa whoa!
I'm sorry.

09:29.595 --> 09:33.265
Did someone just promote the second-
string quarterback to team captain?

09:33.299 --> 09:35.167
I don't think so!

09:35.201 --> 09:38.403
I bebt drug tests.
It's what I do.

09:38.437 --> 09:41.506
I'll decide what's
best for this team.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.408
We're doing oil changes.

09:44.443 --> 09:46.478
All in favor of pvacs.

09:48.647 --> 09:50.781
All in favor
of oil changes.

09:52.783 --> 09:54.517
Larry, seriously?

09:54.551 --> 09:56.552
They really
hurt, man.

10:01.191 --> 10:03.026
You're all
a bunch of babies!

10:06.029 --> 10:08.431
Hey, what's up, man?
How's it goi?

10:08.465 --> 10:12.734
Oh, yeah, okay, real quick.
Here we go. Cheese. Take it easy.

10:12.769 --> 10:15.971
- I'm the best. - Oh, my God,
I can't believe it's you!

10:16.005 --> 10:18.006
- Take me home with you.
- What?

10:18.040 --> 10:20.274
- Take us both home with you.
- Okay, let's go.

10:20.309 --> 10:23.010
There's just one thing.
We want to be with the goat.

10:23.045 --> 10:24.278
With the goat?

10:24.313 --> 10:27.181
Yeah. Whatcha got
under there, mr. Goat?

10:27.216 --> 10:28.849
What are you doing? Whoa!

10:28.883 --> 10:31.418
Well, nothing.

10:31.452 --> 10:33.453
There's definitely
something inside the costume.

10:33.488 --> 10:35.555
We want to be
with the goat, so

10:35.589 --> 10:38.292
You just let us know when
you can make that happen.

11:16.328 --> 11:19.998
Gentlemen, your pvacs.

11:20.032 --> 11:21.200
Bingo!

11:21.234 --> 11:22.668
Choose wisely.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.842
They barely
even look real.

11:28.876 --> 11:31.378
They look
real enough.

11:33.816 --> 11:35.183
Ah, this
will work.

11:35.217 --> 11:36.417
This one will
work for me too.

11:36.452 --> 11:38.486
Sammy, you're not
even being tested.

11:38.521 --> 11:40.755
What would you possibly
need a fake penis for?

11:40.789 --> 11:43.591
- That's for me to know, and
for girls to find out. - Right.

11:46.229 --> 11:51.166
So what's a sexy girl like you
doing dealing in fake penises?

11:51.200 --> 11:53.702
I deal in whatever
the people want.

11:53.736 --> 11:56.071
Oh yeah? Well, uh,

11:56.105 --> 11:57.439
What if I want
your phone number?

12:01.178 --> 12:03.613
I aim to please.

12:07.084 --> 12:08.618
Hey, these
are great.

12:08.653 --> 12:10.988
Okay, so how much for the
piss and the piss bags?

12:11.022 --> 12:14.292
Piss isn't my jurisdiction. I
only deal in the fake penises.

12:14.326 --> 12:15.359
And hard drugs.

12:15.394 --> 12:16.927
Wait wait. No no!

12:16.962 --> 12:18.996
What good are fake penises
without clean piss?

12:19.030 --> 12:20.964
I don't know.
Why doesn't God appear

12:20.999 --> 12:22.732
and tell us everything's
gonna be okay?

12:22.767 --> 12:24.067
What does that even mean?

12:24.102 --> 12:26.202
It means I don't
deal in clean piss.

12:26.237 --> 12:27.970
See ya.

12:28.005 --> 12:30.072
Great.

12:30.106 --> 12:32.974
Now how are we supposed
to get clean piss?

12:33.009 --> 12:35.610
The only way
I know how.

12:35.644 --> 12:37.212
Let's go.

12:41.851 --> 12:43.385
Oh, no. No no no.

12:43.420 --> 12:44.954
What the hell
are we doing here?

12:44.988 --> 12:47.356
You said you wanted clean
piss. This is how I get mine.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.092
It's time to learn
the ropes, frosh.

12:50.995 --> 12:53.063
Do you realize how
bad we look right now?

12:53.098 --> 12:55.900
Dude, we look
bad-ass.

12:55.934 --> 12:58.135
Hey, little homies,
I got a quezzle.

13:01.539 --> 13:03.006
Hey, let's make a deal!

13:03.040 --> 13:06.376
You guys piss in this bag and
I'll give you some tenjamins.

13:08.980 --> 13:12.048
- We'll do it for 30.
- Are you kidding me, asswipe?

13:12.083 --> 13:14.017
Take it or leave it,
asswipe.

13:15.519 --> 13:16.652
Deal.

13:16.687 --> 13:19.856
Run! Come on!
Run!

13:29.600 --> 13:31.835
All right, goat,
show us what you got.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.614
Hello, my name is Donna,
and I'm an addict.

13:43.648 --> 13:44.714
Hi, Donna.

13:44.749 --> 13:48.084
And I've been sober
for 17 years.

14:39.805 --> 14:41.506
- So I called her.
- Who?

14:41.540 --> 14:43.007
Fake-dick dealer.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.042
You're dating the
fake-dick dealer?

14:45.077 --> 14:47.611
- Jealous?
- Kind of.

14:47.646 --> 14:49.613
All right, everybody, listen up.

14:49.648 --> 14:52.851
Just a reminder... the drug-testing
will take place tomorrow

14:52.885 --> 14:54.519
Right here.

14:54.553 --> 14:57.589
And I expect everyone
is gonna pass the test.

14:57.623 --> 14:59.490
- Am I right?
- Yes, coach!

14:59.525 --> 15:01.192
Make my dream come true.

15:01.227 --> 15:03.762
All right. See you
on the field.

15:08.335 --> 15:11.470
Shit. It's gone.

15:11.505 --> 15:14.173
My pvac is gone!

15:14.208 --> 15:16.075
My pvac's gone!
The test is tomorrow!

15:16.109 --> 15:19.011
Shit! Mine's gone too.

15:28.088 --> 15:29.321
What did you do
with them?

15:29.356 --> 15:30.690
I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:30.724 --> 15:31.790
The pvacs are gone.

15:31.825 --> 15:32.791
What did you do
with them?

15:32.825 --> 15:34.827
I made an
executive decision.

15:38.231 --> 15:41.166
You cut them? You cut
the heads off oj them?

15:41.200 --> 15:43.101
What am I supposed to do with
this? The test is tomorrow!

15:43.135 --> 15:46.337
I can think of a solution,
and it's called an oil change!

15:48.506 --> 15:51.442
I told you from the beginning
those fake dicks are too risky.

15:51.476 --> 15:52.943
I'm the captain
of this team,

15:52.977 --> 15:55.812
And I say we're
doing oil changes.

15:55.846 --> 15:58.482
Oil changes for everybody!

16:12.245 --> 16:14.980
Okay, listen up!

16:15.014 --> 16:16.915
Remember, you must empty
the bladder completely

16:16.950 --> 16:18.250
for this to work.

16:18.285 --> 16:21.120
If any of you need help,
Larry will assist you.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.155
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

16:23.189 --> 16:25.157
Fake penises do not
grow on trees.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.428
Please! I will
pay you double.

16:29.462 --> 16:31.764
It'll take a couple
of days at least.

16:31.799 --> 16:33.199
What? No, I...

16:33.233 --> 16:34.800
- There you are.
- Hey, you.

16:37.471 --> 16:40.941
Let's go upstairs. I got
something I want to show you.

16:40.975 --> 16:42.342
No, I need her.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.378
Good thing they're not
testing for pussy today,

16:44.412 --> 16:46.313
'cause there's
no way I'd pass.

16:46.348 --> 16:48.048
Will you please
stop that?

16:49.818 --> 16:51.419
I can't do this.

16:53.055 --> 16:56.357
Just keep drinking.
It'll dull the pain.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.222
Yeah. Just like that.

17:30.625 --> 17:33.126
Aren't you gonna be late
for your drug test?

17:33.160 --> 17:35.562
I might be.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.398
But you're worth it.

17:39.868 --> 17:41.136
You like that,
don't you?

17:43.170 --> 17:45.206
That's different.

17:45.241 --> 17:46.875
I like it.

17:51.081 --> 17:53.249
Oh, shit!

17:53.283 --> 17:55.652
I forgot to take that balloon
out after I crossed the border.

17:55.686 --> 17:57.220
Please tell me
this isn't cocaine.

17:57.254 --> 17:59.789
Believe me,
I wish it wasn't.

17:59.823 --> 18:01.490
That's two months'
rent on your face.

18:02.826 --> 18:07.696
Oh, shit! Shit!

18:07.730 --> 18:11.800
Alex! I accidentally
took drugs!

18:11.834 --> 18:14.168
It was an accident!

18:14.203 --> 18:15.837
Where the...?

18:15.871 --> 18:18.606
Oh, shit!

18:21.777 --> 18:24.612
Anybody? High-fives, bud! Me here!

18:24.646 --> 18:26.080
Hey, you want
something? No?

18:26.115 --> 18:30.586
All right. Hey,
picture time! No?

18:30.620 --> 18:31.620
Whatever.

18:31.654 --> 18:36.292
Aw, girls, come on!

18:36.326 --> 18:38.027
This sucks, man!

18:38.061 --> 18:39.695
Sammy!
Oh, shit!

18:39.730 --> 18:42.999
I need you
to help me, man!

18:43.033 --> 18:44.166
Is that a pvac?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.834
No, it's my real dick,
you idiot.

18:47.870 --> 18:50.972
I don't even care!
I was like a king yesterday!

20:01.395 --> 20:03.229
You're missing
one player, coach.

20:03.264 --> 20:04.631
Craig Shilo.

20:04.665 --> 20:06.632
I'm here! I'm here!

20:09.603 --> 20:11.738
Jesus christ, Shilo!
Nice of you to show up.

20:11.772 --> 20:13.339
I'm sorry, coach.

20:13.373 --> 20:15.107
My time is
insanely valuable.

20:15.142 --> 20:16.643
Right.

20:22.316 --> 20:24.017
What the hell
is that?

20:25.085 --> 20:26.520
School spirit.

20:30.524 --> 20:34.694
Everyone passes! Yes!

20:34.729 --> 20:36.162
Everyone passed!

20:36.197 --> 20:38.866
Oil change! Oil change!

20:39.400 --> 20:40.968
We did it!

20:41.002 --> 20:42.936
Tartar sauce!
