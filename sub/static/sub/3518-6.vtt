01:48.390 --> 01:51.309
More water, ma'am?

01:51.392 --> 01:54.019
Yes, please.

01:54.103 --> 01:55.188
How much longer, Ben?

01:55.271 --> 01:58.232
Estimated four hours and 16 minutes.

01:58.316 --> 02:01.110
Some breakfast, maybe? The usual?

02:01.194 --> 02:02.613
That would be wonderful. Thank you.

02:02.696 --> 02:04.864
Only about an hour until sunrise.

02:04.947 --> 02:07.617
Last chance for those Northern Lights.

02:13.915 --> 02:17.669
I could tell you about working
at a movie theater, some paper route.

02:17.752 --> 02:19.713
Riding my bicycle five miles

02:19.796 --> 02:23.132
to deliver seven papers
for ten dollars a month, but...

02:23.216 --> 02:25.134
the truth is,
I didn't have a bicycle,

02:25.218 --> 02:27.804
and I spent more time sneaking
into the movie theater

02:27.887 --> 02:30.348
- than tearing tickets.
- So what was it, then?

02:31.140 --> 02:33.476
My first job?
Oh, that can't go in the book.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.353
Why not?

02:35.436 --> 02:38.565
I worked for a man
who grew cannabis in the back woods.

02:39.357 --> 02:40.734
A weed dealer?

02:40.817 --> 02:42.360
No, a farmer. Uncle Henry.

02:42.443 --> 02:44.884
He wasn't my uncle, but that's
just what everybody called him.

02:44.904 --> 02:47.532
- What did you do for Uncle Henry?
- I packaged the product.

02:47.615 --> 02:49.534
For some reason,
he trusted me with the scales.

02:49.617 --> 02:52.579
Mm. And did you...
partake of the product?

02:52.662 --> 02:54.706
No. Good old Uncle Henry,

02:54.789 --> 02:58.084
he fertilized his crop
from his own septic tank.

02:58.167 --> 02:59.168
Oh...

02:59.252 --> 03:01.755
But it was a good job, though.
I saved up a lot of money.

03:01.838 --> 03:04.965
It's how I bought all my books
my entire four years at The Sentinel.

03:06.426 --> 03:08.386
Tell me about The Sentinel.

03:12.056 --> 03:13.641
What was your first job?

03:14.183 --> 03:17.395
No, no. Book's not about me.

03:20.106 --> 03:22.483
The hustler in Scorpio.

03:23.651 --> 03:25.445
That was you, wasn't it?

03:25.528 --> 03:27.113
What makes you think that?

03:27.196 --> 03:29.574
Don't writers write what they know?

03:31.785 --> 03:34.328
The hustler's based on a friend of mine.

03:34.412 --> 03:36.038
I didn't turn tricks.

03:36.122 --> 03:39.751
I just... waited in the hotel lobbies
in case he got into trouble.

03:39.834 --> 03:42.503
Tough life for a teenager.

03:42.587 --> 03:44.839
Better than digging around in Dumpsters.

03:44.922 --> 03:47.508
What happened to him? Your friend?

03:47.592 --> 03:49.176
He died.

03:49.260 --> 03:51.512
Was it AIDS, like in the book?

03:52.305 --> 03:53.556
Suicide.

03:55.308 --> 03:57.101
Why didn't you write it that way?

03:57.184 --> 03:59.270
Because it was fiction.

03:59.353 --> 04:02.565
Because... suicide is too selfish.

04:05.276 --> 04:06.778
Let's talk later.

04:06.861 --> 04:08.863
I have a few things
I gotta run over with Claire.

04:08.946 --> 04:10.490
Sure.

04:10.573 --> 04:14.118
It's a tight schedule, so we may not
be able to speak until the flight back.

04:14.201 --> 04:16.913
No worries. First time in Moscow.

04:16.995 --> 04:19.248
I've got a date with Gorky Park
and Swan Lake.

04:23.837 --> 04:25.672
How's it going?

04:25.755 --> 04:27.757
Cathy emailed me the statement.

04:28.842 --> 04:31.177
We got the Kremlin
to tone down the language.

04:38.017 --> 04:40.436
Do you think Corrigan will say it?

04:40.520 --> 04:43.147
I'm sure he'll hate every word,
but if it means coming home...

04:43.230 --> 04:45.191
The only reason that
Petrov is considering this

04:45.274 --> 04:47.234
is because we have leverage in the UN.

04:47.318 --> 04:50.988
You're both confident
that this is rock solid?

04:51.071 --> 04:53.491
If Petrov doesn't cooperate,
the Secretary-General

04:53.574 --> 04:56.243
will call an emergency session
the moment we land in the States.

04:56.327 --> 04:58.538
Let's hope we don't
have to play that card.

04:59.455 --> 05:01.290
Just don't give too much away.

05:01.374 --> 05:03.694
Oh, listen, he's been marginalized
in the Security Council,

05:03.751 --> 05:06.504
he's detaining an American citizen,
he wants to wash his hands of.

05:06.587 --> 05:09.173
I think we'll find that we're dealing
with a much more reasonable man

05:09.256 --> 05:11.091
than the one that visited Washington.

05:11.175 --> 05:13.761
We fly back with a peacekeeping deal
and Corrigan.

05:13.845 --> 05:15.513
Lemons to lemonade.

05:16.890 --> 05:19.225
I think we should give Corrigan
our suite on the way back,

05:19.308 --> 05:21.101
give him some privacy from the press.

05:21.185 --> 05:22.562
Yeah, that's a good idea.

05:22.645 --> 05:24.898
- Have you slept at all?
- No.

05:24.981 --> 05:26.941
- Eaten anything?
- Not yet.

05:27.024 --> 05:28.902
Here.

05:32.321 --> 05:33.447
Come see this.

05:44.584 --> 05:46.961
Isn't it the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

06:06.647 --> 06:07.690
Earth to Max.

06:09.191 --> 06:11.569
- Hey.
- You seem distracted.

06:11.652 --> 06:13.570
Yeah, maybe a little.

06:13.654 --> 06:14.864
Is it Kara?

06:14.948 --> 06:17.366
Kara? What?

06:17.450 --> 06:20.160
You should ask her out.
I know she'd say yes.

06:20.244 --> 06:23.539
It'd be good for you.
Meet new people.

06:23.623 --> 06:25.625
I can't. I don't trust myself yet.

06:27.001 --> 06:28.252
What do you mean?

06:31.631 --> 06:34.634
Hey, Max. Tell me.

06:34.717 --> 06:37.303
You promise you won't judge?

06:37.386 --> 06:39.096
I won't, I promise.

06:41.223 --> 06:43.309
Well, after she left,

06:43.392 --> 06:46.896
there were a lot of nights
of drugs and women.

06:46.980 --> 06:49.732
And some of the women,
I don't even remember.

06:50.817 --> 06:52.568
And Kara's a nice girl, so...

06:52.652 --> 06:55.692
- But you're not that person anymore.
- There were some dangerous situations.

06:55.696 --> 06:58.157
It was all really fucked up
and I wasn't always safe.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.619
- Well, have you gotten tested?
- No.

07:01.702 --> 07:03.287
Well, then you need to be tested.

07:03.370 --> 07:04.872
I know, but it scares
the shit out of me.

07:04.956 --> 07:06.707
Well, sure.
Do you want me to go with you?

07:06.791 --> 07:08.084
No, I don't.

07:08.167 --> 07:10.447
There's a clinic in Towson.
Plenty of my friends go there.

07:10.461 --> 07:13.547
- You just walk...
- I get it! I get it.

07:13.631 --> 07:15.800
I could go with you tomorrow
if you want me to.

07:17.010 --> 07:19.178
- I don't need a mother.
- Hey, I'm not trying to mother you.

07:19.261 --> 07:22.306
I just... I care about you
and I want you to be safe.

07:23.641 --> 07:25.351
Just...

07:25.434 --> 07:26.978
Max.

07:27.061 --> 07:28.312
Max!

07:53.838 --> 07:56.382
Oh...

08:09.729 --> 08:13.232
Thank you for releasing Mr.
Corrigan. It means a great deal to us.

08:13.315 --> 08:15.735
And I'm sure a great deal
to his loved ones.

08:15.818 --> 08:18.863
We all want the same things.
This is just a first step.

08:18.946 --> 08:23.117
Mr. Litsky, my chief of staff,
will escort you to the facilities.

08:24.201 --> 08:26.079
- Shall we?
- Mr. President.

08:26.162 --> 08:28.205
- Thank you.
- After you.

08:42.635 --> 08:45.848
So... we start over.

08:45.932 --> 08:48.976
As though we meet
for the first time. Hm?

08:50.019 --> 08:51.395
Please.

09:00.863 --> 09:03.032
- Promise him a prison.
- A prison?

09:03.116 --> 09:05.242
A brand new federal
corrections facility.

09:05.325 --> 09:07.828
Why would his constituents
want convicts in their backyard?

09:07.912 --> 09:10.330
They don't.
They do want jobs in their backyard.

09:10.414 --> 09:13.918
He's been trying to get federal funding
for years. Birch has fought him on it.

09:14.001 --> 09:16.629
Tell him you'll get Birch
to come around. If that doesn't work,

09:16.712 --> 09:19.840
hint there might be a place for him
as Transportation Secretary.

09:19.924 --> 09:21.842
He's owned by the auto industry.

09:21.926 --> 09:24.804
His stance on carbon emissions
is deplorable.

09:24.887 --> 09:27.347
Then balance him out
with whoever you have running the EPA.

09:27.431 --> 09:30.476
I am not ready to make
cabinet commitments this early on.

09:30.559 --> 09:32.895
It's not a commitment.
You're just open to considering him.

09:32.979 --> 09:35.731
Doug? We should get started.

09:35.815 --> 09:39.318
Use the auto industry to your advantage.
Whoever Winkowski supports,

09:39.401 --> 09:42.655
every superdelegate backed
by Ford and Chrysler follows.

09:42.738 --> 09:44.323
And if that doesn't work,

09:44.406 --> 09:48.535
tell him you're considering Dick Butler
for Transportation. He hates Butler.

09:48.619 --> 09:50.871
I gotta go.
Let me know what he says.

09:52.289 --> 09:54.583
You're here to work on your body,
not work on your work.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.418
When the boss calls...

09:56.502 --> 09:59.338
Well, while you're on my turf,
I'm the boss.

09:59.421 --> 10:01.590
Let's get in there
and lie down on the mat.

10:01.674 --> 10:03.176
Yes, ma'am.

10:26.573 --> 10:28.742
- Michael.
- Mrs. Underwood.

10:28.826 --> 10:30.161
Claire.

10:42.506 --> 10:44.508
You've been treated well?

10:44.591 --> 10:46.969
Very well, as you can see.

10:47.053 --> 10:48.345
Thank you, Mr. Litsky,

10:48.428 --> 10:50.514
but I'd like to hear it
from Mr. Corrigan.

10:50.597 --> 10:53.517
Yes, they've treated me well.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.521
- You've seen a doctor?
- I have. Yesterday.

10:57.604 --> 11:00.316
- You look thin.
- I've always been thin.

11:02.235 --> 11:06.197
The president asked me to see you
in person to share the good news.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.532
The terms of your release
have been finalized.

11:08.615 --> 11:11.118
We'll be bringing you home
with us tomorrow.

11:12.619 --> 11:14.121
I thought you'd be pleased.

11:14.205 --> 11:16.207
What are the terms?

11:16.916 --> 11:19.085
There will be a joint press conference.

11:19.168 --> 11:23.714
- With Petrov?
- Yes, both presidents.

11:23.797 --> 11:27.634
The agreement asks
that you make a brief statement.

11:29.095 --> 11:33.349
I'm sorry, um, the type
is too small and I don't have glasses.

11:33.432 --> 11:37.311
- We offered glasses to Mr. Corrigan...
- They did.

11:37.394 --> 11:38.812
Mine broke during the arrest.

11:38.896 --> 11:42.233
The other inmates don't get glasses.
I didn't want special treatment.

11:42.316 --> 11:46.445
We provide glasses to anyone
who needs them, Russian or American.

11:46.528 --> 11:48.530
That is a lie.

11:48.614 --> 11:50.366
I will read it.

11:51.491 --> 11:54.620
It says, "I, Michael Corrigan,
apologize to the citizens

11:54.703 --> 11:57.539
of the Russian Federation
for breaking your laws.

11:57.623 --> 12:02.253
I regret my part in exposing minors
to nontraditional sexual attitudes.

12:02.336 --> 12:07.758
I am grateful to President Petrov
for the clemency my release demonstrates,

12:07.841 --> 12:11.929
and for allowing me to return
to the United States."

12:12.012 --> 12:13.430
Who wrote it?

12:13.513 --> 12:15.349
It's the result of extended negotiations

12:15.432 --> 12:17.559
between representatives
of the State Department

12:17.643 --> 12:20.187
and the Russian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.

12:20.271 --> 12:22.064
I'm sorry, I can't say it.

12:22.148 --> 12:24.900
I know it's far from ideal, Michael.

12:24.984 --> 12:29.029
There is no ideal.
Other than repealing the law.

12:32.866 --> 12:34.576
May we have a moment?

12:36.329 --> 12:38.705
President Petrov asked me
to remain with you.

12:38.789 --> 12:40.833
And I'm asking you to give us a moment.

12:48.507 --> 12:52.136
Mr. Litsky?
I'm assuming this cell is bugged?

12:52.219 --> 12:55.222
I know nothing about the facilities.

12:55.306 --> 12:57.724
- Where is it?
- Mrs. Underwood.

12:58.892 --> 13:02.355
If Mr. Corrigan and I
are to speak privately,

13:02.438 --> 13:05.565
I would like to be assured
that it is truly private.

13:05.649 --> 13:07.067
Show me where the bug is.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.465
Thank you.

13:40.934 --> 13:43.854
They're not going to repeal the law.

13:43.937 --> 13:46.190
The statement is a prerequisite
for your release.

13:46.273 --> 13:48.401
There are no negotiations here, Michael.

13:48.484 --> 13:50.277
That part already happened.

13:50.361 --> 13:53.739
- What about the 27 others?
- They're not American.

13:53.822 --> 13:56.325
Well, if they're not gonna be released,
neither should I.

13:56.409 --> 13:59.203
There's nothing we can do for them.

13:59.286 --> 14:03.332
You're the First Lady,
and the ambassador to the United Nations.

14:03.416 --> 14:05.625
And you're telling me there's
nothing you can do?

14:05.709 --> 14:07.253
I refuse to believe that.

14:07.336 --> 14:10.423
Michael, it was hard enough
to negotiate just for your release.

14:10.506 --> 14:13.175
You'll have to drag me out of here
because I'm not giving that statement.

14:13.259 --> 14:14.843
It's just words.

14:14.927 --> 14:18.347
Words you can disown
the moment you're back on US soil.

14:18.431 --> 14:22.559
Petrov's gay propaganda law?
That's just words, too.

14:24.270 --> 14:26.980
So, command and control rotation.

14:27.064 --> 14:30.443
Semi-annually, after the first year.
We pushed for immediate rotation,

14:30.526 --> 14:32.652
- but the Israelis have...
- No, of course.

14:32.736 --> 14:34.363
We need to earn their trust.

14:34.447 --> 14:36.656
But we would never make
any major decisions

14:36.740 --> 14:38.617
without consulting your generals first.

14:38.700 --> 14:41.537
As long as there is transparency
and communication.

14:41.620 --> 14:43.460
Well, that's the key
to this entire enterprise.

14:43.539 --> 14:47.501
Mm-hm. Then after the first year
is fine and, uh...

14:47.584 --> 14:50.296
troop numbers look agreeable,

14:50.379 --> 14:53.590
are you sure you can procure
this many on your end?

14:53.673 --> 14:55.759
Yes. I don't need Congress for that.

14:55.842 --> 14:58.345
No, but the funding.

14:58.429 --> 15:00.889
It comes out of the DOD budget
like any regular deployment.

15:00.973 --> 15:04.935
Now, infrastructure
and logistical supplies for your troops,

15:05.018 --> 15:08.314
well, we can add that expense
as ancillary support.

15:08.397 --> 15:09.689
Hm. We can pitch in.

15:09.773 --> 15:12.609
Well, whatever you could spare
would certainly be welcome.

15:12.692 --> 15:16.613
Hm. But... that brings us
to the elephant in the room.

15:16.696 --> 15:19.032
- Missile defense.
- Mm-hm.

15:19.116 --> 15:21.494
Now, I can accept
a partial scale-back in Poland.

15:21.577 --> 15:23.912
And it doesn't have to be... announced.

15:23.996 --> 15:26.957
But we need to consider
the Czech Republic.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.460
Tell me your concerns.

15:54.860 --> 15:57.070
Your wife values privacy.

15:57.154 --> 15:58.864
Excuse me?

16:00.491 --> 16:02.618
We were talking missile defense.

16:02.701 --> 16:04.661
Why did you bring up Claire?

16:04.744 --> 16:07.956
She's... talking privately to Corrigan.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.502
- It's no matter.
- Is there something wrong?

16:11.585 --> 16:13.212
I hope not.

16:14.588 --> 16:17.841
Now, missile defense.

16:17.924 --> 16:20.302
A statement
for the Russian media.

16:20.386 --> 16:23.889
- That's all it is.
- Let me ask you something.

16:23.972 --> 16:26.808
Would you read that statement
if you were me?

16:26.892 --> 16:28.685
Yes, I would.

16:28.768 --> 16:32.565
You'd thank a man who says
you're dangerous to children?

16:32.648 --> 16:36.902
You don't have to mean it.
You just have to say it.

16:42.991 --> 16:46.119
I went on a hunger strike for six days.

16:47.496 --> 16:49.206
Then I stopped.

16:50.207 --> 16:54.086
Too hungry.
I couldn't go on.

16:54.169 --> 16:58.382
One of the others that, uh,
I was arrested with, Sergei,

16:58.465 --> 17:00.967
hung in there for 28 days.

17:03.011 --> 17:05.097
They decided to force-feed him,

17:05.180 --> 17:08.058
and they finally agreed
to let his mother visit.

17:08.141 --> 17:11.728
Turns out it was too late,
on both counts.

17:11.810 --> 17:13.896
Lots of news stories about me.

17:13.980 --> 17:16.650
None about Sergei.

17:16.733 --> 17:19.986
A man dies
and it's like nothing happened.

17:21.029 --> 17:22.864
Because he's Russian.

17:24.366 --> 17:27.536
I can't abandon the others in here.

17:27.619 --> 17:30.830
Or the millions of people out there

17:30.914 --> 17:33.959
who are told the way
they are born is wrong.

17:34.042 --> 17:37.337
But back home,
you can share Sergei's story.

17:37.421 --> 17:39.715
That doesn't do anything
for him or the others.

17:52.519 --> 17:56.022
We will drag you out if necessary.
You don't have any power over that.

17:56.106 --> 18:00.068
But the one thing I do have power over
is not making that statement.

18:00.152 --> 18:01.445
Okay.

18:03.405 --> 18:07.033
What if I can get them
to change the line

18:07.117 --> 18:09.244
about nontraditional sexual attitudes?

18:09.328 --> 18:11.913
- That's what bothers you most, right?
- You can't parse this.

18:11.997 --> 18:14.916
- It's all or nothing.
- That's not how politics works.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.919
But it's how revolution works!

18:20.213 --> 18:21.674
How are things going?

18:23.425 --> 18:25.719
May I speak with you for a moment?

18:46.239 --> 18:49.326
- What are you up to?
- What do you mean?

18:49.409 --> 18:50.744
Corrigan.

18:52.204 --> 18:54.581
- Tell me what's wrong.
- You wanted him to refuse.

18:54.665 --> 18:57.000
To embarrass me. Your wife told him
not to make the statement.

18:57.083 --> 19:00.629
- That is ludicrous.
- You came here with false intentions.

19:00.713 --> 19:03.465
No. Viktor, we knew
that he might be stubborn.

19:03.549 --> 19:05.925
But this is a man with strong beliefs.

19:11.431 --> 19:12.932
This statement is important to me.

19:13.016 --> 19:16.186
Well, if anything, Claire
is trying to convince him to make it.

19:16.269 --> 19:19.356
Then why did she ask for the
surveillance audio to be removed?

19:20.440 --> 19:21.983
I don't know.

19:22.067 --> 19:23.985
Perhaps so he wouldn't feel on the spot.

19:24.069 --> 19:26.488
But, look, I wouldn't worry
about this just yet.

19:26.572 --> 19:28.407
Claire is very persuasive.

19:28.490 --> 19:30.242
Let me be very clear.

19:30.325 --> 19:33.036
If there is no statement,
there is no deal on any front.

19:33.119 --> 19:35.497
Not between us. Not for him.

19:35.581 --> 19:38.208
He gets tried, convicted, sentenced.

19:40.377 --> 19:44.631
Now, I asked Mr. Litsky
to inform them both.

19:44.715 --> 19:47.342
I have complete confidence in my wife.

19:47.426 --> 19:51.054
And Viktor, you must know,
this isn't part of any plan.

19:52.639 --> 19:54.099
That's it.

20:06.236 --> 20:09.364
There's no flexibility
with regard to the statement.

20:09.448 --> 20:11.533
You don't cooperate, you go to trial.

20:11.617 --> 20:14.453
Good. They can't keep me
from speaking in court.

20:15.995 --> 20:17.956
What about your husband?

20:19.291 --> 20:21.460
You've spoken to John?

20:21.543 --> 20:23.462
I let him know we were hopeful.

20:26.339 --> 20:28.258
How is he?

20:28.341 --> 20:30.051
He's worried about you.

20:34.055 --> 20:37.476
He wanted to come with us, but that
wasn't possible, for obvious reasons.

20:37.559 --> 20:41.104
I promised to call after I saw you.

20:45.024 --> 20:50.113
I was thinking... you'd call instead.
From Air Force One.

20:50.196 --> 20:52.073
He'll understand.

20:52.908 --> 20:54.910
He misses you, Michael.

20:54.993 --> 20:58.580
I miss him. I miss a lot of things.

20:58.664 --> 21:01.207
My parents. My friends. My dog.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.794
More than two square feet of sunlight.

21:03.877 --> 21:07.380
But it's the life we chose.
It's what our bond is built on.

21:07.464 --> 21:11.134
John has been very vocal back home.
All he talks about is your release.

21:12.886 --> 21:16.473
You're causing him pain.
And you don't have to.

21:16.556 --> 21:19.392
And he didn't have to marry me.

21:21.186 --> 21:23.689
- That's selfish.
- Maybe.

21:23.772 --> 21:27.275
But so is contradicting everything
I believe in just to get out of this cell.

21:27.359 --> 21:31.237
I think what you're doing
is more selfish. It's about ego.

21:31.321 --> 21:34.073
Proving something to yourself.

21:34.157 --> 21:37.035
And a man back home
is hurting because of it.

21:37.118 --> 21:39.996
John is weak.
He'd say the statement in a heartbeat

21:40.079 --> 21:41.874
if he spent more
than a few days in here,

21:41.957 --> 21:43.709
which is why I'm here and he's not.

21:43.792 --> 21:45.752
If he thinks I'm being selfish, so what?

21:45.836 --> 21:48.755
Either he accepts it or he doesn't.
Isn't that what marriage is about?

21:48.839 --> 21:52.592
Accepting your partner's selfishness?
You of all people should understand.

21:52.676 --> 21:54.636
You know nothing about marriage.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.890
You think it's about... sacrifice?

21:59.349 --> 22:02.268
I think it's about respect.

22:02.352 --> 22:04.646
And you're not respecting his pain.

22:04.730 --> 22:07.607
- His pain doesn't matter.
- How can you say that?

22:07.691 --> 22:09.234
Because mine doesn't either.

22:10.193 --> 22:13.405
You know what I've been asking myself
ever since the hunger strike?

22:13.488 --> 22:16.700
Am I truly willing to die for this?

22:16.783 --> 22:19.369
I don't know the answer
to that question.

22:19.452 --> 22:21.705
But at least I have something
that I care enough about

22:21.788 --> 22:23.373
to even ask the question.

22:24.917 --> 22:27.419
Have you asked that of yourself?

22:27.502 --> 22:29.880
What are you willing to die for?

22:32.925 --> 22:35.844
Are you ready yet, Mrs. Underwood?

22:37.345 --> 22:38.847
Not yet.

22:38.931 --> 22:41.182
How much longer, if I might?

22:42.559 --> 22:44.143
Please inform the president

22:44.227 --> 22:48.147
I won't be leaving
until Mr. Corrigan comes with me.

22:48.231 --> 22:51.735
- You can't stay here, Mrs. Underwood...
- Pass along the message, would you?

22:51.818 --> 22:53.612
We can't have the First Lady staying...

22:53.695 --> 22:56.364
You're not going to forcibly remove me.

22:56.448 --> 22:58.491
So, please, do as I ask.

23:03.329 --> 23:05.916
What are you doing?
Viktor is beside himself.

23:05.999 --> 23:08.418
You need to convince him
to let go of the statement.

23:08.501 --> 23:10.670
Look, you have to assume
we're being overheard.

23:10.754 --> 23:12.171
This is not a secure line.

23:12.255 --> 23:15.050
Anything I'm saying, I'd say
to Petrov himself if he were here.

23:15.133 --> 23:18.094
I thought you were convincing Corrigan
to make the statement.

23:18.177 --> 23:22.223
Francis, I'm doing my best, but we need
to come at this from both sides.

23:22.307 --> 23:24.977
Well, he's adamant. He's not gonna
back down and I don't blame him.

23:25.060 --> 23:26.519
Corrigan's adamant, too.

23:26.603 --> 23:28.897
The entire deal hinges on this.

23:28.981 --> 23:30.941
Now, Viktor made it very clear
what his needs are,

23:31.024 --> 23:34.444
- and we made promises before we...
- I'm trying to salvage the situation.

23:34.527 --> 23:37.781
There isn't much time. We're scheduled
to get back on the plane tomorrow

23:37.864 --> 23:39.616
and the press expects Michael
to get on with us.

23:39.699 --> 23:41.284
Viktor, if you're listening to this,

23:41.367 --> 23:43.286
please know I'm advocating
on your behalf.

23:43.369 --> 23:46.039
But you might want
to consider letting the statement go.

23:46.122 --> 23:48.124
He's not gonna do it, Claire.

23:48.207 --> 23:49.417
Just talk to him, Francis.

23:49.501 --> 23:52.045
If he won't let it go,
see if he'll tone it down some more.

23:52.128 --> 23:54.380
He doesn't want all of this
to fall apart either.

23:54.464 --> 23:56.716
All right. I'll see what I can do.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.343
I'll keep you posted.

24:03.389 --> 24:07.435
- Oh, this is great. Thank you.
- Uh-huh. If I could have a receipt...

24:10.689 --> 24:12.858
- Oh. Excuse me. Sorry.
- I appreciate it.

24:13.859 --> 24:15.360
Hey, Max.

24:15.443 --> 24:17.070
I'm here at the clinic.

24:17.153 --> 24:18.279
Are you okay? You sound...

24:18.363 --> 24:21.282
I'm scared. They're about to take
the blood sample. Can you come?

24:21.366 --> 24:22.909
Please, I'm really scared, Lisa.

24:22.993 --> 24:26.663
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

24:26.746 --> 24:28.957
Yeah. Just hold tight.

24:31.668 --> 24:34.587
Hey, um, I need to go.
Do you mind taking care of all this?

24:34.671 --> 24:36.756
- Mm-hm.
- Okay, thank you.

24:38.633 --> 24:41.177
Good news, Mr. Orsay.
You're negative on all fronts.

24:41.260 --> 24:43.304
There are the results, for your records.

24:43.388 --> 24:45.932
I've got some literature if you like,
on protection,

24:46.016 --> 24:50.186
preventative strategies,
how to avoid high-risk encounters.

24:50.269 --> 24:52.689
No, thank you, I'm... I'm good.

24:57.193 --> 24:59.445
Yeah, actually, I will take those.

25:39.402 --> 25:40.904
I'm positive.

25:51.164 --> 25:54.751
I just I can't...
I can't be alone right now.

25:55.919 --> 25:57.754
Come with me. Come with me.

25:57.837 --> 25:59.131
Okay?

26:08.556 --> 26:10.516
- Stamper.
- You're good.

26:10.600 --> 26:11.643
He said yes?

26:11.726 --> 26:14.562
Took a couple of hours,
but he's on board.

26:14.646 --> 26:17.023
Did you have to bring up Butler?

26:17.107 --> 26:19.192
- The prison was enough.
- Great.

26:19.275 --> 26:22.695
- Who's your next target?
- Willis Morrison, Twelfth District.

26:22.779 --> 26:25.031
Ohio. I have his file at home.

26:25.115 --> 26:26.699
I'll call you in an hour.

26:27.784 --> 26:30.245
Surprise, surprise.
You're on the phone again.

26:30.328 --> 26:33.248
I'm on my time now, not yours.

26:33.331 --> 26:34.666
You outta here?

26:34.749 --> 26:36.793
Yeah, you were my last appointment.

26:36.876 --> 26:38.461
Did that work today help?

26:38.544 --> 26:40.463
It did. I feel great.

26:40.546 --> 26:42.132
Well, you're making great progress.

26:42.215 --> 26:44.050
And when you're fully recovered,
you know,

26:44.134 --> 26:46.495
we'll have that cell phone
surgically removed from your ear.

26:47.971 --> 26:49.597
See you later.

26:57.480 --> 27:00.859
But isn't it even more powerful
coming from me?

27:00.942 --> 27:03.528
It would ring hollow.
The words must come from him.

27:03.611 --> 27:05.822
But no one will believe
he means them, anyway.

27:05.905 --> 27:07.532
Whether he means them doesn't matter.

27:07.615 --> 27:10.535
The fact that he says them
shows respect for our laws.

27:10.618 --> 27:15.040
I wish he'd make the damn statement too,
and maybe he will. But if he doesn't,

27:15.123 --> 27:18.835
you're willing to let all the work we've
accomplished today go down the drain

27:18.918 --> 27:21.420
because of one loud-mouth protester

27:21.504 --> 27:24.716
over a law you can't
possibly believe in?

27:24.799 --> 27:27.177
No, you're right.
I don't believe in it.

27:27.260 --> 27:29.470
Two of my cabinet ministers are gay.

27:29.554 --> 27:31.597
My ex-wife's nephew is gay,

27:31.681 --> 27:34.017
the one who is basically
like a son to me.

27:34.100 --> 27:35.560
Personally, I don't care.

27:35.643 --> 27:40.148
So if you don't care, let's haul him out
and put him on the plane.

27:40.232 --> 27:44.485
Look, I don't want our deal
to fall apart any more than you do.

27:44.569 --> 27:46.404
Your wife was right on the phone.

27:46.487 --> 27:51.492
But there is more than just our deal
for me to consider.

27:51.576 --> 27:53.203
I need to show strength.

27:53.286 --> 27:55.538
No one's going to see this as a weakness.

27:55.621 --> 27:59.042
On the contrary,
you'll be applauded for letting him go.

27:59.125 --> 28:01.460
By who? Hm? The West?

28:01.544 --> 28:04.089
You don't understand Russia,
Mr. President.

28:04.172 --> 28:08.426
If people don't like the job you're
doing, they vote you out of office.

28:08.509 --> 28:11.346
If they don't like the job I'm doing,
they topple statues.

28:11.429 --> 28:13.598
Blood is spilled.
Chaos takes over.

28:13.681 --> 28:16.351
Is the gay propaganda law barbaric? Yes.

28:16.434 --> 28:17.894
Of course it is.

28:19.020 --> 28:22.023
But religion, tradition,

28:22.107 --> 28:25.484
for most of my people,
it's in their bones.

28:25.568 --> 28:28.113
This law was passed for them.

28:29.072 --> 28:32.951
I have to represent my people
the same way you do.

28:33.034 --> 28:35.411
And if there is no cost
to Corrigan's actions,

28:35.494 --> 28:38.123
many of my people will feel betrayed.

28:38.206 --> 28:42.794
There won't be a revolution
because you freed one man.

28:44.003 --> 28:47.548
Revolution sneaks up on you,
one small step at a time.

28:49.175 --> 28:53.346
I don't take chances,
even with the smallest of steps.

29:03.022 --> 29:06.359
No stone left unturned
when the First Lady's in town.

29:08.820 --> 29:10.780
Can I ask you something?

29:10.863 --> 29:12.490
If you pass the salt.

29:14.700 --> 29:18.121
How did Michael Corrigan
become Michael Corrigan?

29:18.204 --> 29:20.873
- Gay?
- An activist.

29:20.957 --> 29:23.084
I'm sure you got a briefing
from the FBI.

29:23.168 --> 29:25.878
Yes, but I would like
to hear it from you.

29:28.131 --> 29:31.259
A friend of mine,
and this is in the early '90s,

29:31.343 --> 29:35.263
she invited me to go with her
to a community organizing meeting.

29:35.347 --> 29:38.183
I had nothing better to do,
so I said okay.

29:38.266 --> 29:41.602
We get there and there's maybe
12 people in the room, tops.

29:41.686 --> 29:43.188
It was pretty sad, actually.

29:43.271 --> 29:48.026
And the guy speaking
is talking about garbage.

29:48.109 --> 29:50.362
- Garbage?
- Recycling.

29:50.445 --> 29:53.990
And the guy is putting
all 12 of us to sleep.

29:54.073 --> 29:58.411
What he was saying made sense,
but... zero charisma.

29:58.494 --> 30:01.789
- It was worse: anti-charisma.
- [laughs]

30:02.415 --> 30:04.459
But I noticed
he had this habit of, uh...

30:05.460 --> 30:08.380
tilting his head when he was
making an important point.

30:08.463 --> 30:11.799
It was...
it was so endearing.

30:13.009 --> 30:14.886
It was like this.

30:15.594 --> 30:17.972
Like...

30:18.056 --> 30:20.617
I couldn't help it. I fell in love
with him right then and there.

30:20.641 --> 30:22.268
This was John?

30:22.352 --> 30:27.523
A long time ago,
in a galaxy far, far away.

30:27.606 --> 30:29.775
Well, he's pretty charismatic on TV.

30:29.859 --> 30:32.653
He learned charisma.
I learned how to think.

30:33.654 --> 30:35.365
We rubbed off on each other well.

30:35.448 --> 30:37.283
I didn't know you'd been
together so long.

30:37.367 --> 30:38.701
Twenty-one years.

30:38.784 --> 30:42.538
Only been married for five
because, well, we couldn't earlier.

30:44.040 --> 30:46.501
Francis and I just celebrated 28.

30:46.584 --> 30:48.294
Over half your life.

30:50.296 --> 30:53.007
That's true.
I haven't even thought about that.

30:53.091 --> 30:55.468
You were young.

30:55.551 --> 30:57.136
Twenty-two.

30:58.388 --> 31:00.056
You ever regret it?

31:01.182 --> 31:04.685
No. No. I love Francis.

31:04.769 --> 31:06.062
Now more than ever.

31:06.145 --> 31:08.064
I regret it.

31:09.232 --> 31:12.235
Committing to someone
before I even knew who I was.

31:12.318 --> 31:16.197
We didn't take legal vows,
but we had our own version.

31:16.281 --> 31:18.991
- Stupid.
- Why?

31:19.075 --> 31:22.745
Because all I've ever done is hurt him.

31:23.829 --> 31:27.459
Um, kept him in my shadow,
cheated on him, you name it.

31:27.542 --> 31:31.587
Well, it's the history that counts,
not the other things, right?

31:31.670 --> 31:34.257
That's true. No substitute for history.

31:35.300 --> 31:38.094
But it's unfair to him.

31:39.678 --> 31:41.764
I don't believe in fairness.

31:41.847 --> 31:45.059
I don't think you do either,
even though you fight for it.

31:45.143 --> 31:47.645
And I don't believe
you love your husband more than ever.

31:47.728 --> 31:50.482
- How could you possibly know?
- Takes one to know one.

31:53.609 --> 31:56.904
John and I haven't slept with each other
in almost two years.

31:56.988 --> 31:59.240
We don't even sleep in the same bedroom.

31:59.324 --> 32:02.743
We've talked about separating,
but we never follow through.

32:02.827 --> 32:07.373
It seems wrong to fight this hard for
marriage equality and then get divorced.

32:07.457 --> 32:09.917
Bad for business.

32:10.001 --> 32:13.379
Honestly, I don't think
it's how humans are built.

32:13.463 --> 32:16.549
To be with each other for 50 years.

32:17.842 --> 32:19.885
You don't have that option either,
do you?

32:19.969 --> 32:21.137
How do you mean?

32:21.220 --> 32:25.391
Well, if you wanted something else,
that would be really bad for business.

32:27.810 --> 32:29.061
You should eat.

32:29.145 --> 32:30.938
Said the snake to Eve.

32:31.022 --> 32:33.649
Eat your apple.
The world won't end.

32:41.740 --> 32:44.285
You need to get on the phone
and tell her to leave.

32:44.369 --> 32:46.245
She wouldn't listen to me even if I did.

32:46.329 --> 32:49.915
She's dead set on convincing this guy
for your benefit.

32:49.999 --> 32:52.918
I'll have the guards escort her out
if necessary.

32:53.002 --> 32:55.588
They will not lay a finger on my wife.

32:56.797 --> 32:59.675
You'd actually prefer that,
wouldn't you?

32:59.758 --> 33:03.304
So you could tell the world
we dragged the First Lady out by her hair.

33:03.388 --> 33:06.932
I'm finding it more and more difficult
to tolerate your paranoia.

33:07.016 --> 33:09.352
I could say the same of your lies.

33:09.435 --> 33:13.523
When I lie to you, you'll never know it,
and it will be for a good reason.

33:13.606 --> 33:16.484
Corrigan doesn't fall
into that category.

33:20.946 --> 33:23.658
I should never have invited you here.

33:23.741 --> 33:27.703
You and I can work together.
This afternoon is proof.

33:27.786 --> 33:29.914
I would've been better off
holding my ground.

33:29.997 --> 33:31.832
And forcing us to pass the resolution?

33:31.916 --> 33:34.252
The United Nations?
They mean nothing to me.

33:34.335 --> 33:37.213
If they meant nothing to you,
you would have held your ground.

33:37.296 --> 33:40.799
But you want to be respected abroad
as much as you are at home.

33:40.883 --> 33:44.554
And I came here out of respect, Viktor.

33:44.637 --> 33:46.889
And I sympathize
with the situation you're in.

33:46.972 --> 33:48.600
That we're both in.

33:48.683 --> 33:54.439
Let's not let Michael Corrigan
dictate the course of nations.

33:58.484 --> 34:04.198
Can we at least discuss
what a statement from me might look like?

34:07.410 --> 34:09.036
You look exhausted.

34:10.204 --> 34:12.873
I didn't sleep much on the plane, so...

34:12.956 --> 34:14.708
You should go back.

34:14.792 --> 34:17.335
There's no reason for you
to be in here with me.

34:18.337 --> 34:19.505
I'm not leaving.

34:21.047 --> 34:23.301
You're more stubborn than I am.

34:23.384 --> 34:25.678
Why won't you let me help you?

34:25.761 --> 34:27.763
I've made my demands clear.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.601
Michael, let me tell you
what's going to happen

34:32.685 --> 34:34.687
if you refuse to make this statement.

34:34.770 --> 34:36.063
You'll help no one.

34:36.147 --> 34:40.652
In fact, life will get worse
for the others you were arrested with.

34:40.735 --> 34:43.070
Petrov will feel embarrassed.
He will arrest more people.

34:43.154 --> 34:45.156
He will pass worse laws.

34:45.239 --> 34:49.577
He's not going to let some American
homosexual dictate his policy.

34:49.661 --> 34:52.163
This man is ruthless.

34:52.246 --> 34:55.541
You think he's gonna become reasonable
suddenly when all of this falls apart?

34:55.625 --> 34:57.168
You're being naive!

34:57.251 --> 35:00.463
And you're letting other people suffer
because of it.

35:00.546 --> 35:04.258
Don't undo what you've
fought so hard for.

35:04.342 --> 35:07.178
You think you can shame me.
But you can't.

35:07.261 --> 35:10.973
I'm giving you the truth.
I don't care how that makes you feel.

35:11.056 --> 35:13.434
But do yourself the favor
of hearing what I said.

35:13.518 --> 35:16.270
- I heard you.
- I hope so.

35:16.354 --> 35:18.481
I can't betray myself.
What would I be then?

35:18.564 --> 35:20.525
You'd be a politician.
And that's what you are.

35:20.608 --> 35:22.652
Let the others do
all the yelling and screaming.

35:22.735 --> 35:24.903
You want change?
Then learn how to compromise.

35:24.987 --> 35:29.408
- Be a fucking adult about this, Michael.
- I need to think. Okay? I need time.

35:31.243 --> 35:33.496
The plane leaves tomorrow.

35:33.579 --> 35:36.081
You should go back.
I need time to think alone.

35:36.165 --> 35:39.418
- Clear my head.
- I'm not leaving here without you.

35:39.502 --> 35:40.503
I need time!

35:42.714 --> 35:45.466
Just... lie down for a little bit.

35:45.550 --> 35:47.468
Just get some rest.

35:47.552 --> 35:50.346
- I just can't talk anymore.
- Okay.

35:50.429 --> 35:52.515
Okay, I will.

35:54.266 --> 35:55.768
For a few minutes.

36:35.850 --> 36:37.226
Thanks.

36:50.865 --> 36:52.450
There's treatment now.

36:53.492 --> 36:56.746
The thing that angers me the most
is that I let her do this to me.

37:03.210 --> 37:07.047
Did you feel that way about your ex?
The pain that just consumes you?

37:07.131 --> 37:09.007
Oh. For a while, yeah.

37:10.050 --> 37:12.428
Still, on bad days.

37:17.391 --> 37:19.811
Mm...

37:19.894 --> 37:21.437
What was she like?

37:23.355 --> 37:24.690
Sorry, you don't have to...

37:24.774 --> 37:26.317
No, I don't mind.

37:27.318 --> 37:28.986
She was...

37:32.197 --> 37:34.158
She'd had a tough life.

37:34.241 --> 37:37.077
She had a lot of baggage.
Which I did, too.

37:38.913 --> 37:42.541
We started out as friends
and then we moved in together.

37:44.168 --> 37:46.796
And then it just happened.

37:46.879 --> 37:48.172
We fell in love.

37:49.423 --> 37:51.216
And I don't know, I guess...

37:53.093 --> 37:55.930
I felt stronger with her.

37:56.013 --> 37:57.973
And I think she felt the same way.

37:59.809 --> 38:02.144
And I guess maybe it was naive,

38:02.227 --> 38:05.731
but I thought that together,
we could let go of all that baggage.

38:06.941 --> 38:08.818
Then we'd just be us.

38:11.278 --> 38:13.739
Well, why did she leave?

38:15.533 --> 38:18.369
She said everything
was happening too quickly.

38:22.874 --> 38:25.376
Have you spoken to her... since?

38:27.712 --> 38:31.215
Nope. She stopped coming
to the fellowship.

38:32.633 --> 38:36.220
I stopped by her apartment once,
her landlord said she was gone.

38:36.303 --> 38:39.765
Just no idea where she is?

38:46.146 --> 38:48.858
We used to lie in bed
and fantasize about where we'd go

38:48.941 --> 38:53.195
if we could go anywhere.
Paris, Australia, Timbuktu.

38:55.614 --> 38:59.326
That was Rachel, the far-off places.
I didn't need that.

39:06.417 --> 39:08.168
Where would you go?

39:11.547 --> 39:14.258
The Jimenez Trail.

39:14.341 --> 39:15.593
Where is that?

39:15.676 --> 39:18.095
- New Mexico.
- Oh.

39:18.178 --> 39:23.726
Cuts across the whole state.
It's got hot springs and waterfalls.

39:25.102 --> 39:27.939
We used to say we'd go there, hike it,

39:28.022 --> 39:31.525
find a good spot, build a cabin.

39:36.196 --> 39:39.825
I'm sorry, we shouldn't
be talking about me.

39:39.909 --> 39:41.869
I asked.

39:41.953 --> 39:44.079
That tea smells good.

39:44.162 --> 39:46.290
I think I'll have some, too.

40:13.651 --> 40:15.069
This looks good.

40:15.152 --> 40:17.195
- You say every word.
- Of course.

40:17.279 --> 40:19.114
And then you take him
directly to the plane.

40:19.197 --> 40:21.826
Viktor... thank you.

40:23.619 --> 40:26.371
Hm... But the Czech Republic,

40:26.455 --> 40:29.207
I want all the missiles gone,
not just a scale-back.

40:29.291 --> 40:32.044
You can keep something in Poland
for show, but that's it.

40:32.127 --> 40:35.631
- Agreed.
- So, we have a deal?

40:35.714 --> 40:38.092
Including everything we discussed
about the Jordan Valley.

40:38.175 --> 40:41.929
- Yes, of course.
- Then we have a deal.

41:15.713 --> 41:17.673
Come, Mrs. Underwood.

41:20.718 --> 41:22.553
Please. You shouldn't be here.

41:29.685 --> 41:32.021
Mrs. Underwood.

41:47.369 --> 41:48.871
I'm sorry.

41:54.543 --> 41:57.295
Would you like to lie down for a bit?
Change your clothes?

41:57.379 --> 41:59.757
- No, I can do that on the plane.
- Well, you go straight there.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.509
- We have the press conference to do.
- I should be with you, Francis.

42:02.593 --> 42:04.136
We have that handled.

42:05.179 --> 42:09.433
I'd like to say something.
A few warm words to his family.

42:09.516 --> 42:12.227
Yes. Yes, of course.

42:12.310 --> 42:15.439
I'll echo your sympathy and then...

42:15.522 --> 42:18.859
then say that I was planning
on releasing him today.

42:18.943 --> 42:24.156
I'll thank you for your...
your generosity.

42:24.239 --> 42:26.825
How tragic this has been.

42:28.577 --> 42:30.704
And then a few words
about the Jordan Valley,

42:30.788 --> 42:33.082
or if you'd prefer
to announce our agreement.

42:33.165 --> 42:35.209
No, no, it's fine if you do.

42:36.210 --> 42:40.464
Would you... mind if your people
showed me a draft of your remarks?

42:40.547 --> 42:43.092
Yes, I'll have them
draft something right now.

42:43.175 --> 42:46.261
And yours, too, Mrs. Underwood?

42:46.344 --> 42:49.473
Yes. It's fine. Whatever you want.

43:08.242 --> 43:10.995
Ladies and gentlemen...

43:12.830 --> 43:14.206
Good morning.

43:15.666 --> 43:19.920
Mrs. Underwood would like to start
by saying a few words.

43:24.258 --> 43:29.054
As you all know, Michael Corrigan
was found dead in his cell this morning.

43:29.138 --> 43:32.099
He had hung himself.

43:32.183 --> 43:34.601
Michael and I spoke briefly yesterday.

43:34.685 --> 43:38.647
He was being treated well
and was grateful to President Petrov

43:38.730 --> 43:41.483
for granting his imminent release.

43:41.566 --> 43:46.197
We don't know why...
Michael chose to do what he did.

43:47.739 --> 43:50.701
We all wanted nothing more
than for Michael to come home today

43:50.784 --> 43:55.914
and we offer our heartfelt condolences
to his family and his loved ones.

43:55.998 --> 43:57.415
Thank you.

43:57.499 --> 43:59.501
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.

44:11.847 --> 44:13.182
Mrs. Underwood?

44:14.516 --> 44:18.603
I didn't just speak to him yesterday,
I was there when it happened, asleep.

44:18.687 --> 44:22.191
He hung himself with my scarf.

44:22.274 --> 44:26.486
I do know why Michael
decided to take his own life:

44:26.570 --> 44:28.822
because he didn't want to lie.

44:28.906 --> 44:32.617
And I can't dishonor him
by telling a lie now.

44:32.701 --> 44:33.952
Claire...

44:35.370 --> 44:39.374
I was trying to convince him
to say that he broke the law,

44:39.457 --> 44:41.210
to thank President Petrov.

44:41.293 --> 44:45.547
But he refused, because he didn't want
to leave until the law was repealed.

44:45.630 --> 44:49.551
Until the Russians who were arrested
for the same crime were also released.

44:49.634 --> 44:52.346
Michael was willing to die
for what he believed in.

44:52.429 --> 44:54.890
- Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.
- He was brave.

44:56.141 --> 44:59.394
- And his voice deserves to be heard.
- That's enough.

44:59.477 --> 45:01.730
If it weren't for this unjust law,

45:01.813 --> 45:04.942
and ignorance and intolerance
of your government,

45:05.025 --> 45:06.735
Michael would still be with us.

45:08.028 --> 45:09.738
Shame on you, Mr. President.

45:18.956 --> 45:20.791
My wife has been under a...

45:21.917 --> 45:24.920
great amount of stress
these past 24 hours.

45:25.003 --> 45:27.298
She's clearly in shock.

45:27.381 --> 45:31.969
My apologies to President Petrov
and to the Russian people.

45:32.052 --> 45:34.346
If you'll excuse me,
I need to be with her now.

46:22.269 --> 46:24.771
- Claire.
- Don't, Francis.

46:35.907 --> 46:37.826
It's imperative that I speak to him.

46:37.909 --> 46:39.370
Well, keep trying, Cathy.

46:39.453 --> 46:43.332
If Petrov won't get on the phone
with me, then I'll speak to Bugayev.

46:43.415 --> 46:45.667
Whoever will get on the phone
with me, then.

46:46.835 --> 46:48.586
All right. Thank you.

46:51.089 --> 46:52.590
Your coffee, sir.

46:55.802 --> 46:57.346
Thank you, Ben.

47:14.112 --> 47:15.864
- Mr. President.
- Later.

47:21.161 --> 47:23.580
I just got off the phone with Cathy.
The deal's off.

47:23.663 --> 47:26.958
Everything we negotiated.
We have to discuss the next move.

47:27.959 --> 47:30.003
I know what I did. It seemed impulsive,

47:30.087 --> 47:32.256
- but it wasn't...
- It happened. Let's move on.

47:32.339 --> 47:34.758
If you have something
you would like to say, Francis...

47:34.841 --> 47:37.511
I just want to minimize the damage.
If Petrov won't come around,

47:37.594 --> 47:40.138
we have to move forward
with the resolution at the UN.

47:40.222 --> 47:41.432
We're prepared for that.

47:41.515 --> 47:43.517
Good. Thank you.
Try to get some sleep.

47:55.570 --> 47:58.407
Shouldn't you be in the back,
with the press?

47:58.490 --> 48:01.618
- I'm not press.
- You're not staff either.

48:02.577 --> 48:03.954
My apologies.

48:06.164 --> 48:07.749
Mrs. Underwood?

48:08.542 --> 48:10.168
You did the right thing.

48:22.973 --> 48:25.600
I know you're angry.

48:25.683 --> 48:27.352
You should be.

48:27.436 --> 48:29.062
But I had to do it.

48:30.481 --> 48:33.650
Is this some sort of apology, or you
need to get something off your chest?

48:33.733 --> 48:35.569
I want you to try and understand.

48:35.652 --> 48:37.446
Understand?

48:38.280 --> 48:40.491
- What you did was beyond...
- I know.

48:41.992 --> 48:45.245
You're not only the First Lady,
and an ambassador,

48:45.329 --> 48:46.955
you're also my wife.

48:47.038 --> 48:49.541
- In what order?
- Oh, come on, Claire.

48:49.624 --> 48:52.586
I said what I said for him.

48:52.710 --> 48:55.839
Not for myself, not for us.

48:55.922 --> 48:58.550
I felt we owed him more
than a few false words.

48:58.633 --> 49:00.635
So you want me to forgive you?
To say that it was okay?

49:00.718 --> 49:02.262
- No.
- Because I can't do that.

49:02.346 --> 49:05.723
- I'm not asking you to.
- Then why are we even discussing it?!

49:07.267 --> 49:10.521
- Because I want you to know why.
- I don't care why.

49:10.604 --> 49:12.272
I don't care what your reasons are.

49:12.356 --> 49:15.108
There is no reason
that can possibly convince me

49:15.192 --> 49:19.070
that you should have sabotaged
a peace plan we spent months on!

49:19.154 --> 49:21.198
It was a political mistake.

49:21.281 --> 49:23.908
Yes, I admit that.
But if I had said nothing,

49:23.992 --> 49:27.371
- his death would have meant nothing.
- No. Not death. Don't give him that.

49:27.454 --> 49:30.415
- Suicide.
- No. Something undeniable.

49:30.499 --> 49:32.000
I was not gonna try and deny it.

49:32.083 --> 49:34.443
- I don't even understand that.
- If you'd give me a chance.

49:34.503 --> 49:37.548
I gave you a chance with the recess
appointment, with the resolution,

49:37.631 --> 49:39.007
with handling Corrigan.

49:39.090 --> 49:41.468
He didn't have a choice, Francis.
We cornered him.

49:41.552 --> 49:44.221
- He did have a choice.
- Not in his mind.

49:44.304 --> 49:47.015
No one forced him to protest in Moscow.

49:47.098 --> 49:51.936
And we sure as hell didn't ask him
to tie your scarf around his neck!

49:52.812 --> 49:54.689
If you had spoken to him...

49:56.816 --> 49:58.485
and heard what he had to say...

49:58.569 --> 50:00.409
Oh, what, I would have
had some moral epiphany?

50:00.445 --> 50:02.155
- Yes, you would have.
- I don't think so.

50:02.239 --> 50:04.533
Because I'm the President
of the United States

50:04.616 --> 50:08.412
and I can separate the big
from the small.

50:08.495 --> 50:09.913
He wasn't small.

50:09.996 --> 50:12.832
He was a coward and I'm glad he's dead.

50:12.916 --> 50:15.126
He had more courage than you'll ever have.

50:20.882 --> 50:23.468
Do you really want
to discuss courage, Claire?

50:24.469 --> 50:27.055
Because anyone can commit suicide,

50:27.138 --> 50:30.308
or spout their mouth
in front of a camera.

50:30.392 --> 50:33.728
But you wanna know
what takes real courage?

50:33.811 --> 50:38.442
Keeping your mouth shut,
no matter what you might be feeling.

50:38.525 --> 50:43.154
Holding it all together
when the stakes are this high.

50:45.449 --> 50:47.284
We're murderers, Francis.

50:51.204 --> 50:53.998
No, we're not. We're survivors.

50:54.082 --> 50:57.210
If we can't show some respect
for one brave man

50:57.294 --> 50:59.379
and still accomplish
what we set out to do,

50:59.463 --> 51:03.091
- then I'm disappointed in both of us.
- I should've never made you ambassador.

51:04.134 --> 51:06.344
I should've never made you president.

51:13.352 --> 51:15.396
What are you looking at?
