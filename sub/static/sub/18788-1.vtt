01:07.320 --> 01:11.473
Someone once asked me
why I stick up for Mikey.

01:13.320 --> 01:17.280
They clearly don't have a brother.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.589
It could be any other game, honestly.

01:42.680 --> 01:43.909
Who beat me on any game?

01:44.040 --> 01:45.110
- Yeah.
- Really, now?

01:45.200 --> 01:47.112
I don't think you
understand I own the arcade.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.680
No, you don't, but I do.

01:48.760 --> 01:49.750
- I own every game.
- Let's prove it.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.758
I'll beat you on every game.
Here, take it.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.439
Take all these quarters.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.273
- You think you're gonna win?
- Yeah.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.350
I'm gonna beat you anyway.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.760
Hey, can I get some quarters, Mikey?

02:12.840 --> 02:14.638
No, get your own money.

02:30.280 --> 02:34.069
Aw, don't cry. Little bitch.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.798
Hey, guys, what can I get for you?

03:02.640 --> 03:04.916
I'll take the baseball cards.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.829
Thanks.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.796
Come on.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.993
I'm hungry, Mikey.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.310
Come on.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.236
Here. Go play some video games.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.995
Do you want some or not? Take it!

05:21.520 --> 05:23.989
Why are you still standing
there like a fucking retard?!

05:24.080 --> 05:26.390
Go to the arcade! Go!

08:08.320 --> 08:09.879
Open your fucking mouth.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.911
Open it.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.037
Open your mouth. That's it.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.312
Bite down on the pipe.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.438
Sneaking around?

09:14.520 --> 09:16.193
No, I'm sorry.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.350
I was looking for you.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.316
You found something else, didn't ya?

09:21.400 --> 09:22.959
What'd you see?

09:23.080 --> 09:25.276
Nothing.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.080
- I didn't see anything.
- Come on, Mikey, what did you see?

09:28.160 --> 09:30.356
Something that's beautiful?

09:32.120 --> 09:33.440
Nothing.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.478
- I swear.
- That's good, kid.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.473
That's how you stay quiet.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.836
He didn't stay quiet, Mikey.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.794
Didn't stay quiet.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.634
Come on, you can do it.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.440
Yes, JP!

10:17.520 --> 10:18.749
- Nice job, JP.
- Good job.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.155
Working for Eddie is my thing, okay.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.391
Stay away from the arcade.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.313
Look, Eddie's been giving me
more and more work though so

10:58.400 --> 11:01.796
I figure I ain't got no more time to mow
Miss Cindy's lawn no more.

11:03.880 --> 11:04.996
Go ahead.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.833
It's yours if you want it.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.036
But you gotta put gas in it.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.270
You gotta mow it every week

11:09.360 --> 11:11.272
and sweep all the grass of the driveway,

11:11.360 --> 11:14.717
but if you do all that, it's your job.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.314
It's your money.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.713
I don't know what to tell you.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.998
If you can't handle it,
I'll find someone who can.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.433
I know you can do it,
come on, get out there.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.034
Apply yourself, huh.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.756
- JP.
- Yeah?

11:44.840 --> 11:47.071
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.879
All right, Rob, talk to me.
Everything going good?

11:50.960 --> 11:53.031
Well, we're behind on
the office building job,

11:53.120 --> 11:55.032
'cause some of the guys
have been texting on site.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.395
Well, tell them to stop texting.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.755
They're here to construct not text.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.354
I mean, Rob, you're my partner right?

11:59.440 --> 12:01.875
- Yeah.
- All right, then act like a boss.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.953
- Implement a "no texting" policy.
- You got it.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.760
- Hey, you coming back later?
- Maybe.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.594
You're late!

12:16.680 --> 12:20.754
Please. I am prompt, present, and prepared

12:20.840 --> 12:23.071
to beat your ass, my friend.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.316
Bring it.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.599
- Right over the plate.
- Let's get into it.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.830
Come on.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.835
Ball outside.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.437
We want a pitcher, not a belly itcher!

12:39.520 --> 12:41.716
We want a pitcher, not a belly itcher.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.316
Come on.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.636
Oh, yeah!

12:53.720 --> 12:54.949
Whoo!

12:55.040 --> 12:57.953
Slamma, jamma, ding-dong, baby!

12:58.040 --> 13:00.600
Slamma, jamma, ding-dong, whoo-hoo!

13:00.680 --> 13:02.353
Come on. Yeah!

13:08.120 --> 13:09.474
You go get it!

13:21.200 --> 13:24.796
You know, Mikey, I have
a job for you if you want it.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.554
It's just sitting there waiting for you.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.756
Okay?

13:30.400 --> 13:31.550
Don't worry about me.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.996
I'm just trying to help out.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.879
I know you've been having a
hard time since you got back so...

13:41.480 --> 13:43.233
All right, see ya tomorrow.

13:43.320 --> 13:46.040
- Okay?
- Yeah. All right.

14:19.360 --> 14:22.751
I've got an excess of
glocks right now, Mikey.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.315
I can't do anything with this.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.278
That's not all I got.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.199
What in the fuck is this?

14:32.280 --> 14:34.795
- That's a flashbang.
- Flash what?

14:34.880 --> 14:37.793
Flashbang, stun grenade.
It's what SWAT uses.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.997
That's James Bond shit right there.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.594
All right, so what do you want for it?

14:41.680 --> 14:43.478
A couple hundred bucks?

14:43.560 --> 14:46.029
The city pays like 6,000
bucks for one of those.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.474
Ain't gonna find them
anywhere on the street.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.439
Yeah, but I don't have anybody
coming in here asking to buy 'em.

14:50.520 --> 14:54.230
Because they don't think
you have one, asshole.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.835
Mikey, I got guys coming
in here wanting protection

14:56.920 --> 15:00.072
from sheet holders,
or car jackers, or an ex.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.392
What in the fuck are they
gonna do with a stun grenade?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.154
Tell you what, man.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.316
For you.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.669
Six hundred bucks.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.160
High as I can go.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.600
Six hundred. Why don't you take that 600

15:19.680 --> 15:21.433
and go buy yourself a gold dildo,

15:21.520 --> 15:23.671
and stick up your ass.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.592
Get the fuck outta here, Mikey.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.354
Next time bring me something I can sell.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.671
Come on, baby, what's the matter?

17:06.440 --> 17:07.874
- Hey, Sal.
- Hey.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.076
You ready for today?

17:09.160 --> 17:11.196
Naw, I'm gonna skip today.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.193
- That's too bad.
- I fucked up my wrist.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.032
- Hey, Sal.
- Hey, baby.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.794
Listen, I need to talk to you about Mikey.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.348
Yeah, sure, what's up?

17:22.440 --> 17:26.190
I was gonna confront him myself, but you
know he goes deaf every time I speak.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.474
- No, I know.
- Right.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.914
He bought a package.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.356
- What?
- Not just to snort.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.875
- How do you know?
- Come on.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.840
Fuck. It's always something.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.310
Man, I don't even know where he
got the money to buy the shit.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.391
I'm not worried about him getting busted.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.234
Okay? I'm not going to bust him.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.233
But he's gonna get himself killed.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.357
- All right, I'll talk to him, yeah.
- All right?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.477
- Thanks.
- All right.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.630
JP.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.878
- Yes, yes!
- Excuse me.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.119
You made it. I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.680
Of course, man, I wouldn't miss it.

18:32.760 --> 18:36.231
- Where's Lizzie?
- She's parking the car.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.711
Watch, watch, watch, watch,
watch, watch, watch, watch.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.230
Hell, yeah, what would Lizzie do?

19:15.320 --> 19:17.551
She'd be our manager. Would you manage us?

19:17.640 --> 19:18.630
Why don't you and your
little gay friend sit down.

19:18.760 --> 19:19.989
Your team fucking sucks.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.719
Why don't you shut up, Mr. Clean?

19:21.800 --> 19:23.712
- Mikey, leave it.
- What are you a Jacksonville fan?

19:23.800 --> 19:25.154
You guys always lose.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.993
I mean you've been losing year after year.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.639
Your like an evolution of losing.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.712
They've actually accepted
being fucking losers,

19:30.800 --> 19:32.314
that's why he doesn't shoot
himself in the fucking head.

19:32.440 --> 19:33.999
- Look at him.
- Man, fuck you.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.037
- No, fuck you, man.
- Hey, Mikey, Mikey.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.440
Sit down, sit down.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.352
Look man, y'all even got
tickets to be sitting here?

19:39.440 --> 19:40.999
- Why don't y'all get outta here?
- What are you security now?

19:41.080 --> 19:42.560
- I could be.
- Relax.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.279
Hey, why don't you teach your bitch
how to cheer for a real team.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.840
Hey, hey, come on that's my wife.
Don't start with her.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.115
Man, fuck you.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.154
Stop! I'll shoot.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.556
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

21:37.640 --> 21:39.552
You know why we're here. The coke.

21:39.640 --> 21:40.915
Where is it?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.390
Oh, the coke.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.870
The coke, it's in the fridge.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.478
Make another joke about
the coke being in the fridge.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.710
Come on.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.476
All right. Give me some crayons.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.358
I can draw you a map.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.075
The coke's in the fucking crisper.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.038
I got it, let's go.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.114
Pussy.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.314
That stupid motherfucker.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.596
Your brother's always
getting into trouble.

22:34.680 --> 22:38.356
You know he can't control himself,
and he always has your attention.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.510
Babe...

22:41.960 --> 22:46.637
Somebody else
has already got my attention.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.270
- Babe, your clothes.
- I don't care.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.679
Recognized your car, shit tard.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.080
Fuck!

23:18.160 --> 23:20.311
I was on your softball team
four fucking years ago.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.312
Remember? Remember?

23:23.400 --> 23:25.198
Where is it? Where is it?

23:25.280 --> 23:26.953
Fuck! Fuck!

23:27.040 --> 23:28.440
Where the fuck is it?

23:28.520 --> 23:30.512
- I don't have it, man.
- Bullshit!

23:35.000 --> 23:38.198
See if this jogs your goddamned memory.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.237
- You don't understand.
- What don't I understand, huh?

23:42.320 --> 23:44.357
Well, help me understand.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.154
Fuck. CJ Clout.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.916
We weren't stealing for ourselves.
Clout made us do it.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.957
Fuck. Fuck, man.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.509
Yeah, he made you do it, huh?

23:58.160 --> 24:00.629
Fuck... fuck, man.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.200
It's not about the 10 or 20 grand.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.749
He doesn't like people
stepping on his turf.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.554
Yeah, well, he's stepping
on my fucking turf.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.109
Where's my goddamned coke, huh?
Where is it?

24:10.200 --> 24:11.873
Ethan does all that.

24:11.960 --> 24:14.031
We don't handle his drugs.
We're the money men.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.030
No?

24:37.240 --> 24:39.755
- Vicki, you want a beer?
- Yeah, thank you.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.035
They're a little warm.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.157
That's fine.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.310
You want warm beer?

24:44.400 --> 24:46.869
I want a beer. Thanks.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.959
Hey.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.509
Alexis? Eyes up, honey.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.990
You're here with family.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.390
Seriously, would you put
your damn phone down.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.317
Do you have it or not?

25:16.400 --> 25:17.675
Mikey.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.513
Do you or not?

25:19.600 --> 25:21.239
It's Independence Day, relax.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.313
So the fuck what?
The judge said you gotta pay.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.153
He didn't say, "Oh, you
gotta pay it this often

25:26.240 --> 25:27.879
except for motherfucking Fourth of July."

25:27.960 --> 25:29.917
Yeah, the judge doesn't
know about my fucking pension.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.037
I don't get any fucking health,
and you know that!

25:32.120 --> 25:34.157
- So shut the fuck up!
- Why does she have to be here?

25:34.240 --> 25:36.994
It's the only way he can eat
with Alexis. You know that.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.390
So why can't they go
somewhere else together?

25:39.480 --> 25:43.110
He's my brother. She's my niece.
They're harmless.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.510
I don't think you understand
the meaning of the word harmless.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.831
You know, if I could get away
with killing you, I would.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.877
That's lovely, honey.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.872
They're gonna ruin dinner.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.030
Get a fucking job.

25:53.120 --> 25:56.033
- You get a fucking job.
- I work.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.873
Yeah, you spread your
legs for a fucking living.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.360
Now the baby's crying.

25:59.440 --> 26:02.000
- Fuck you, you're a pig.
- And you're a fucking whore.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.476
No, no, no, no.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.274
- Damn it.
- Okay, I got it, it's okay.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.640
How's school?

26:23.120 --> 26:24.793
It's fine, I guess.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.593
How's your grades?

26:30.120 --> 26:31.270
Pretty good.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.355
How's your mom treating you?

26:38.280 --> 26:39.350
Good.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.514
You know, I'd really like it
if you'd come stay with me for awhile.

26:48.280 --> 26:49.350
I know, Dad.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.276
I'm just busy right now.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.592
We've got a...

27:15.680 --> 27:17.956
one medium-rare burger there for you.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.440
Oh, wait, hold on.

27:21.400 --> 27:25.474
No, Mikey, don't eat yet.
Lizzie wanted to say the prayer.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.393
Mikey, come on. You're a caveman.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.277
And no one wants you here.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.431
Ask Lizzie if she wants you here.

27:37.520 --> 27:38.840
Go ahead, ask her.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.991
Hey, Mikey, come on, please.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.800
- I'm gonna go.
- What? no.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.837
You ain't going anywhere.
We haven't eaten yet.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.196
- I don't eat meat anymore.
- Sit your ass down.

27:48.280 --> 27:52.115
- All right, you know what...
- Come on, Alexis sit back down.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.117
I can say the prayer.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.839
Lizzie's been making me
go to church and what not,

27:56.920 --> 27:58.991
and even though we didn't go as kids,

27:59.080 --> 28:00.992
I remember there was this one time,

28:01.080 --> 28:02.878
when I was coming home
from school on Market Street.

28:02.960 --> 28:06.431
I was about, I don't know, five years old.

28:06.520 --> 28:10.480
And there was this homeless
guy preaching on the street

28:10.560 --> 28:12.836
next to the Dollar Store.

28:12.960 --> 28:17.671
You know, he had his Bible
and he was going on and on.

28:17.800 --> 28:21.350
At the time, I didn't know
he was a crazy homeless guy.

28:21.440 --> 28:22.556
He was so passionate.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.040
I thought he was some kind of preacher.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.840
So I got caught up listening.

28:26.920 --> 28:30.038
There was some people there,
maybe five or six,

28:30.120 --> 28:35.149
and he was going on and on,
he's saying, "He loves you.

28:35.240 --> 28:38.233
"He doesn't think about himself,
He only thinks about you.

28:38.360 --> 28:40.716
He would do anything for you."

28:40.800 --> 28:42.792
And as I said, you know,
I didn't go to church,

28:42.880 --> 28:46.760
so I didn't know what he was saying,
I didn't know what he was preaching,

28:46.840 --> 28:52.393
but I started figuring
I knew who he was talking about.

28:52.480 --> 28:57.555
He's saying, "He will do
anything for those that follow him.

28:57.640 --> 29:01.316
"He wouldn't think twice
about dying for you.

29:01.400 --> 29:04.837
He would die for you, he really would."

29:04.920 --> 29:09.995
So after about 15 minutes,
the crowd sort of scattered...

29:11.600 --> 29:16.595
Man, I'm five years old,
and I walk right up to him,

29:16.680 --> 29:20.833
and I say, "How do you know my brother?

29:20.920 --> 29:22.912
How do you know Mikey?"

29:28.840 --> 29:30.354
To my big bro.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.636
Aren't you supposed
to say "amen" at the end?

29:32.720 --> 29:34.712
That was a toast not a prayer.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.998
Alexis, shut up.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.231
No, no, fair enough.

29:41.320 --> 29:42.515
Amen.

29:44.360 --> 29:45.555
Dig in.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.195
Thanks for having us.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.474
Hey, hey, Mikey. Is it true what I heard?

29:55.560 --> 29:57.119
You took my 10 Gs
and you bought some coke,

29:57.200 --> 29:59.396
and you wanted to flip it?

30:02.880 --> 30:04.394
What do you want me to say?

30:04.480 --> 30:06.472
I loaned you that money
so you could pay for rent.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.439
You said Alexis needed braces.

30:09.520 --> 30:10.795
Well, the girl, she needs braces.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.111
She needs a lot of
things that I can't afford.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.669
That's why I took the 10,
and I tried to turn it into 20.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.752
So you're a drug dealer now?

30:17.840 --> 30:19.877
It doesn't matter. It's all gone.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.117
- What do you mean it's gone?
- I got jacked.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.032
I'm out all 10.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.555
Are you fucking kidding me?

30:27.640 --> 30:30.155
Mikey, you... you have a daughter.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.994
I'm a fuck-up, man.
I'm a fuck-up as a father.

30:33.080 --> 30:36.278
I fucked up with the Marines.
I'm not perfect like you.

30:36.360 --> 30:37.840
You perfect son of a bitch.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.151
Perfect business, perfect fucking wife.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.469
Perfect fucking life.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.358
You can't blame me for your behavior.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.478
You can't blame the Marines
for your bad conduct discharge.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.119
- You can't...
- Just shut up about that.

30:48.240 --> 30:51.278
I'll never ask for money again, okay?

30:55.160 --> 30:56.230
Fuck it.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.429
Gonna buy me a shot?

31:03.520 --> 31:04.556
No.

31:16.800 --> 31:20.271
Hey! Look who it is.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.156
If it isn't little Michael.
Mikey's in town.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.594
Have a seat, kid.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.237
Sit down, let's talk for old times sake.

31:37.440 --> 31:42.390
So what's new?
Where you working at these days?

31:42.480 --> 31:44.915
I'm between jobs.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.992
Sounds like me talking to the IRS.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.720
What's it been, six, maybe eight years?

31:51.800 --> 31:53.200
Didn't you owe me some money?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.239
Didn't you though?

31:56.320 --> 31:57.549
Yeah, you did owe me some money.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.233
You were supposed to
come through on something for me

31:59.320 --> 32:00.720
right around the time you quit.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.276
I figured we're even.

32:03.400 --> 32:06.677
Oh, you think we're even, you and I?

32:06.760 --> 32:09.639
What'd you ever do for me?
I did everything for you.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.030
You want me to make lists?
I got you a job.

32:12.120 --> 32:15.591
I got you laid when you were 14.

32:15.680 --> 32:19.833
Gave me my first line at 15.
That was a great habit.

32:26.400 --> 32:28.960
Look at you, you turned out all right.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.430
So, let's talk about
that brother of yours.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.876
You know, I read about him.

32:33.960 --> 32:38.591
Mister Entrepreneur,
the blue collar American dream.

32:38.680 --> 32:41.115
"I make money,
I build jobs for my community,

32:41.200 --> 32:43.874
blah, blah, blah..." How's he doing?

32:45.400 --> 32:46.390
He's good.

32:47.480 --> 32:50.075
How come you guys aren't still close?

32:50.160 --> 32:54.313
What do you mean close? We're brothers.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.437
Well, that's funny because

32:56.520 --> 32:58.239
you were practically like
a father to that kid,

32:58.320 --> 33:00.437
and he hasn't ever done shit for you.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.796
Well, it doesn't look like
he's done shit for you,

33:02.880 --> 33:05.156
which brings me to my point.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.435
You know, Mikey,

33:07.560 --> 33:09.631
I think I know of a way where

33:09.720 --> 33:12.474
we can both earn what we deserve.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.314
And I'm talking six figures each.

33:17.280 --> 33:18.430
Six figures?

33:55.400 --> 33:57.710
I thought you'd never show up.

34:09.800 --> 34:10.995
Hello.

34:11.080 --> 34:13.072
Jamie Lindell?

34:13.159 --> 34:14.639
- Yeah.
- You have four days

34:14.719 --> 34:18.873
to deliver $350,000 cash,
or your brother dies.

34:18.960 --> 34:23.079
Who is this? Mikey? Hello?

34:24.199 --> 34:25.679
Get the cash together.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.991
We'll be in touch.

34:28.080 --> 34:30.231
Who is this? Is this a joke?

34:30.320 --> 34:31.436
No police.

34:31.520 --> 34:34.114
Four days. Get the money.

34:34.199 --> 34:37.351
Wait, who is this? Hello!

34:37.440 --> 34:38.715
JP?

34:43.960 --> 34:46.395
Mikey, it's me, JP.

34:46.520 --> 34:49.319
Give me a call when you get this, huh?

34:57.440 --> 34:58.920
It's Sal, leave a message.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.390
Sal, call me as soon as you get this.

35:01.480 --> 35:02.994
It's about Mikey.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.320
Mikey?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.195
Hello.

35:36.320 --> 35:38.630
Vicki, have you heard from Mikey?

35:38.720 --> 35:42.157
- I ain't seen him since the other day.
- What about Alexis?

35:42.240 --> 35:45.597
She's been hanging out with these
meth head losers in Plum Orchard.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.160
I haven't seen her either.

35:47.240 --> 35:51.598
All right, call me
if you hear anything, okay?

35:51.680 --> 35:54.240
The last thing the guy says on the phone
is don't contact the police.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.310
Oh, yeah.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.629
And you don't recognize the voice?

35:56.720 --> 35:57.870
No, he sounded like Darth Vader.

35:57.960 --> 35:59.872
He had a voice disguiser or something.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.872
It wasn't Mikey just fucked up?

36:01.960 --> 36:04.350
Well, I don't know. I mean, it just...

36:04.440 --> 36:08.070
I wouldn't think twice if
it wasn't Mikey, you know?

36:08.160 --> 36:09.913
Jesus Christ.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.476
So what do you think?

36:15.600 --> 36:20.629
Hang tight. He'll probably
roll in hung over or something.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.790
I'm hoping.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.520
Hey, I figured you'd be in here
as soon as you saw

36:26.600 --> 36:27.590
how much that mutual fund dropped,

36:27.680 --> 36:28.955
- but I don't want you to worry.
- Rob.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.390
How much money can I get my
hands on in the next few days?

36:31.480 --> 36:33.790
What? I don't know, 10 grand.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.116
Ten grand? No, more.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.669
- What's... what's going on?
- Mikey.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.871
He's fucked up.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.714
I got to put together 350 grand.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.792
Oh, shit.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.109
Is this a joke?

36:48.440 --> 36:49.999
You're not kidding are you?

36:50.080 --> 36:52.037
I need you to start
liquidating everything.

36:52.120 --> 36:55.397
Use property as collateral
against some cash loans.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.709
All of it.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.315
Rob, do you understand?

37:00.400 --> 37:02.119
Yeah, yeah, no, I just...

37:02.240 --> 37:04.277
I'm just worried about you, man.
Obviously something must be wrong.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.511
It is, I just told you it's fucking wrong.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.273
It's my brother.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.670
I just... I'll handle the business later.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.194
Just start putting the money together.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.112
Deal with it, all right?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.593
That's Gus Wylan.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.399
He's been undercover for a solid year.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.039
You think this guy can help?

37:23.120 --> 37:26.318
Look, he agreed to meet you,
that's all I got.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.990
- You coming?
- Yeah.

37:38.120 --> 37:41.079
Hey, man, thanks for meeting me.
That'll take the edge off.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.595
I don't normally do this,
but me and Mikey go way back a ways.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.592
- He was friends.
- He bought a package.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.070
He was trying to turn it
and he got jacked.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.350
Who jacked him?

37:49.440 --> 37:52.751
Some red-headed guy named Rusty.

37:52.840 --> 37:54.672
I know that ginger bitch.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.080
I'll run down Rusty,
see what I can get outta him.

37:59.160 --> 38:01.038
Thanks, man. Let's go.

38:03.960 --> 38:04.950
That's it?

38:32.600 --> 38:33.795
Mikey?

38:49.200 --> 38:50.395
Mikey?

39:00.040 --> 39:01.633
Hey, buddy, you home?

39:33.800 --> 39:34.756
What's this.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.354
Easy, man, that's a stun grenade.

39:36.440 --> 39:37.669
What's he doing with it?

39:37.760 --> 39:39.558
Relax, he wasn't gonna use it.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.280
You gave it to him?

39:43.640 --> 39:44.676
He came by it.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.240
He came by it and he said
he could move it,

39:46.360 --> 39:47.714
and I was doing him a solid.

39:47.800 --> 39:48.950
He was gonna sell it.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.560
What you looking for?

40:24.640 --> 40:25.756
I'm a friend of Mikey's.

40:25.840 --> 40:26.830
Yeah, why didn't he leave you a key?

40:26.920 --> 40:28.434
Why you breaking in?

40:28.520 --> 40:30.637
He wasn't home,
so I was just looking for food.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.439
You looking for coke?

40:32.520 --> 40:33.431
You know where Mikey is?

40:33.520 --> 40:35.512
Huh, do you know where Mikey is?

40:35.600 --> 40:36.829
Nah, he...

40:36.920 --> 40:39.515
Don't fucking lie to me.
Where the fuck is he?

40:39.600 --> 40:40.829
I don't know.

40:42.680 --> 40:44.273
Get the fuck outta here.

40:44.360 --> 40:45.794
Fucking junkie.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.909
The guy that kidnapped your brother,

40:50.000 --> 40:53.072
is not gonna come back
to the house looking for him.

41:00.840 --> 41:01.990
Hi.

41:03.640 --> 41:04.960
Oh, hi.

41:48.200 --> 41:49.600
- Yeah.
- Hey, buddy.

41:49.680 --> 41:52.514
So Gus found this guy, Rusty.
He said he's an asshole,

41:52.600 --> 41:55.638
but he's not smart enough to be
involved in anything like this.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.355
I'm not convinced.

41:58.440 --> 42:01.000
Yeah, let's get you convinced.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.752
Rusty, open up!

42:34.120 --> 42:35.839
- Can I help you?
- I need to talk to you again.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.276
I already talked to your...

43:13.800 --> 43:15.120
What the fuck?!

44:54.600 --> 44:56.796
I already talked to Gus.
I didn't fucking kidnap him.

44:56.920 --> 44:59.037
Rusty, look at me, look at me.
Are you lying to me?

44:59.120 --> 45:00.554
I'm not lying. I'm not lying.

45:00.640 --> 45:02.836
I jacked him for his coke.
I didn't fucking kidnap him.

45:02.920 --> 45:05.515
You hadn't seen JP
or Mikey in a long time,

45:05.640 --> 45:07.199
they come back on your radar,

45:07.280 --> 45:08.873
and you think his brother's a good mark.

45:08.960 --> 45:10.110
No, no, well, yeah.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.192
Everyone knows JP is a good egg.

45:12.280 --> 45:13.953
Still doesn't mean
I fucking kidnapped him.

45:14.040 --> 45:16.919
I jacked him for his coke, man.
I jacked him for his coke.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.560
I fucking killed a guy once, man.
That was six years ago.

45:19.640 --> 45:21.438
The cops never found out about it.

45:21.520 --> 45:24.035
Fuck, fuck, okay. I'm not lying, man.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.759
I'm not lying, I swear, I swear.
I'll tell you about it.

45:25.840 --> 45:27.035
I swear to God, man,
I'll tell you whatever.

45:27.160 --> 45:28.435
I don't know anything.
I'll tell you whatever.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.037
I swear, fellas, I haven't
seen him since here.

45:35.120 --> 45:37.919
It was a waste, so fuck him.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.719
At the Biloxi bar, man.

45:41.160 --> 45:42.833
I swear, fellas.

45:51.160 --> 45:52.640
Excuse me, miss.

45:52.720 --> 45:54.393
Were you working here two nights ago?

45:54.520 --> 45:56.273
Yeah, 'till around midnight.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.079
Who closed?

45:58.160 --> 45:59.879
Can I help you gentlemen with something?

45:59.960 --> 46:01.679
His brother's missing.
Apparently, he was here.

46:01.760 --> 46:04.070
Yeah. His name is Mikey.

46:05.960 --> 46:06.950
Don't recognize him.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.190
Well, then your vision must be terrible.

46:08.280 --> 46:10.317
The guys been drinking
four nights a week for a decade.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.959
- Come on.
- Sorry.

46:12.080 --> 46:15.073
Sorry for refusing to help us
or sorry you don't recognize him?

46:15.160 --> 46:16.594
I'm a cop, don't fuck around.

46:16.680 --> 46:18.273
Just a regular night.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.670
And like I said, I got out at midnight.

46:20.760 --> 46:23.559
But around 11, Eddie King
rolls in with a posse.

46:23.640 --> 46:25.472
Settled into the back
booth near the bathrooms.

46:25.560 --> 46:27.392
- Eddie King?
- Mm-hmm.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.156
Fuck.

46:33.960 --> 46:37.158
So you're saying you think
Eddie King kidnapped your brother?

46:37.240 --> 46:40.312
Yeah. He was in the bar where
my brother was last seen at.

46:40.440 --> 46:43.558
But you don't know that for sure?

46:43.640 --> 46:45.871
What am I missing here?

46:45.960 --> 46:47.713
There's not real mob here in the swamp.

46:47.800 --> 46:50.190
But Eddie King is the
closest thing this place has.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.760
He's got ties in New Orleans and New York.

46:51.840 --> 46:52.796
Exactly.

46:52.880 --> 46:55.031
But folks that are connected,

46:55.120 --> 46:56.440
they don't do this kind of shit.

46:56.520 --> 46:58.159
It's too risky and it's flaunty.

46:58.240 --> 46:59.799
Too much of a stretch.
You don't think he's involved?

46:59.920 --> 47:01.354
The only way I could see that,

47:01.440 --> 47:03.159
is if Eddie King and your brother,

47:03.240 --> 47:05.311
grabbing a drink,
catching up on old times,

47:05.400 --> 47:07.869
and decided to take you
for a few hundred grand.

47:07.960 --> 47:10.634
This is fucking bullshit,
my brother would never do that.

47:10.720 --> 47:13.679
How do you know how much you're worth?

47:13.760 --> 47:16.798
How'd they know to ask for 350 grand?

47:23.960 --> 47:25.758
We gotta find someone else.
Someone more connected than Gus.

47:25.840 --> 47:26.830
There's nobody more connected then Gus.

47:26.920 --> 47:27.956
He's not doing shit.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.520
What do you think,
he's gonna blow his cover,

47:29.600 --> 47:31.398
- for your fucking brother?
- I don't know.

47:31.480 --> 47:33.631
You think anybody in
this fucking department

47:33.720 --> 47:37.430
gives a fuck about your deadbeat brother?

47:37.520 --> 47:38.795
- So there's no one else?
- No.

47:38.880 --> 47:41.031
What do I do? What do I do?

47:41.120 --> 47:42.156
You gotta face it.

47:42.240 --> 47:44.152
The police aren't going to help you here.

47:44.240 --> 47:46.357
I'm going to get all the
information I can on Eddie King.

47:46.440 --> 47:47.510
Okay.

47:47.600 --> 47:50.672
We're just going to
have to handle it ourselves.

47:50.760 --> 47:52.513
I need your help here, okay.

47:52.640 --> 47:55.838
Has he been talking about Eddie King,
mention him, anything?

47:55.920 --> 47:58.071
Yeah, yeah, Mikey talked about Eddie King

47:58.160 --> 48:01.232
probably if he was like drunk
and on a rant or something.

48:01.320 --> 48:03.277
Do you know if he's seen him recently?

48:03.400 --> 48:07.440
No, I... I don't know,
he doesn't tell me shit.

48:07.520 --> 48:12.231
JP, look, I wanna help, I do,
but I'm... I'm concerned about Alexis.

48:12.320 --> 48:16.599
She needs me. If Mikey's fucked,
he probably fucked himself.

48:16.680 --> 48:18.876
It wouldn't surprise me
one bit if he were in on it.

48:18.960 --> 48:19.996
What?

48:22.280 --> 48:26.559
I'm just saying, my mind's on Alexis.

48:26.640 --> 48:29.792
She keeps running off
with these stupid friends,

48:29.880 --> 48:33.237
and I just don't want her to
make the same mistakes I did.

48:33.320 --> 48:36.119
Vicki, you're doing
the best you can, okay?

48:36.200 --> 48:39.910
- Who's she been running with?
- I don't know, some punk kids.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.117
This kid is your best
shot to finding Eddie king.

48:42.200 --> 48:44.237
Now you're going to have a much
better chance if I don't go with you,

48:44.320 --> 48:45.595
'cause they're gonna make me for sure.

48:45.680 --> 48:47.034
How do I find them?

48:47.120 --> 48:49.760
On the back, that's his hang.

48:49.840 --> 48:51.593
I love you, man.

49:01.360 --> 49:02.430
What is it?

49:03.600 --> 49:04.829
Buddy's here.

49:08.680 --> 49:12.071
Buddy? Buddy's here.

49:12.160 --> 49:14.391
My brother? Really?

49:21.000 --> 49:22.912
Well, what does he want?

49:23.000 --> 49:24.593
Wouldn't say.

49:24.680 --> 49:27.149
Should I tell him you're not here?

49:47.400 --> 49:48.470
Buddy?

49:49.760 --> 49:50.989
It's good to see you.

49:51.080 --> 49:52.639
Came for a little chit chat.

49:53.640 --> 49:57.839
A little surprised to see
you outside the Big Easy.

49:57.920 --> 50:01.550
I'm not feeling too peachy keen
being in Biloxi, Mississippi.

50:01.640 --> 50:03.154
Did you lose your phone?

50:03.240 --> 50:05.755
It's been awhile since you made the trek.

50:05.840 --> 50:07.911
Get in the car.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.878
What is this? A brother bonding moment?

50:09.960 --> 50:12.031
It's a little late
for that, don't you think?

50:13.600 --> 50:16.354
Get in the car.
We'll talk while we're driving.

50:34.640 --> 50:35.869
Where we going?

50:37.840 --> 50:40.833
Here. Have a pecan, they're good for ya.

50:40.920 --> 50:42.070
I don't want it.

50:45.040 --> 50:46.554
You should go.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.632
My mom's already gonna
freak out on my ass.

50:53.080 --> 50:54.560
You should smoke this first.

50:59.560 --> 51:00.789
Smoke it, bitch.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.635
Where the fuck you think you going?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.595
You wanna hit my niece?
Huh, you wanna hit my fucking niece?

51:27.680 --> 51:28.557
Stop, stop!

51:28.640 --> 51:30.871
Uncle Jimmy, stop! Let him go.

51:30.960 --> 51:31.950
I'll go.

51:52.720 --> 51:56.634
Buddy, Buddy, Buddy.

52:00.360 --> 52:04.479
Why'd you do this to us, Eddie?
You never could set the table.

52:04.600 --> 52:08.560
- What are you talking about?
- What are you ignorant?

52:08.640 --> 52:11.792
Talk travels fast in
New Orleans just like tourists do.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.111
What, Buddy?

52:14.200 --> 52:18.194
Extortion? Kidnapping, ransom?
I mean, really?

52:18.320 --> 52:19.834
What the fuck were you thinking, Eddie?

52:19.920 --> 52:22.833
No one gives a shit about this guy.

52:22.920 --> 52:25.640
- Nobody.
- Doesn't matter.

52:25.720 --> 52:27.916
What, it doesn't matter?

52:28.040 --> 52:29.713
Is that how it's going to be?

52:29.800 --> 52:31.154
After everything I've done for you?

52:31.240 --> 52:33.516
Everything you've took from me.
Now you wanna take my life?

52:33.600 --> 52:34.750
- Oh, you're good, Eddie.
- Buddy!

52:34.880 --> 52:38.112
You're really good. You're better than me.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.475
Please, turn around.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.836
Turn around, what are
you gonna fuck me first?

52:41.920 --> 52:43.991
No, you're the fuck-up.
You fucked up royally.

52:44.080 --> 52:46.914
Look, I know the idea sounds crazy, okay?

52:47.000 --> 52:49.674
But it's the context of the
thing that was the no-brainer.

52:49.760 --> 52:51.717
This guy's kid brother is...

52:51.800 --> 52:55.157
he's loaded, he was going to
pony up $350,000 in 48 hours.

52:55.240 --> 52:58.039
- The cops don't have shit.
- It's too late.

53:00.400 --> 53:01.436
Fuck you!

53:03.840 --> 53:06.275
Mr. Kuchar, we're finished here.

53:11.280 --> 53:14.273
My brother's trying to kill me, man!

54:22.560 --> 54:24.438
You don't even know me.

54:24.520 --> 54:27.080
You and I think the same, Mikey.

54:27.200 --> 54:30.272
Yeah, you and me we think the same.

54:30.360 --> 54:34.752
JP, he's different. He's good.

54:34.840 --> 54:36.832
We're both fuck-ups.

54:36.960 --> 54:39.873
You think I'd fuck him over for a payout?

54:39.960 --> 54:42.111
There's no amount of money in this world

54:42.200 --> 54:43.520
that I would do that for.

54:43.600 --> 54:44.829
So fuck you, Eddie.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.475
You owe me!

54:48.560 --> 54:51.359
You owe me! I made you!

54:51.440 --> 54:55.275
You got no respect,
no appreciation for your roots!

54:56.280 --> 54:59.830
I'm trying to bring you with me.
It's not too late.

54:59.920 --> 55:02.116
You really wanna pass this job up?

55:02.200 --> 55:04.669
Six figures, easy money, no risk.

55:07.400 --> 55:09.471
Mikey, it's no risk, it's six fig...

55:09.560 --> 55:10.914
Mikey.

55:12.680 --> 55:13.716
Go get him.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.356
Boss has been difficult so...

56:52.440 --> 56:55.319
We can't just send a proof of life.

56:56.360 --> 56:58.352
We gotta send a message.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.798
I feel bad though.

57:02.880 --> 57:04.314
I've known you for a while, Mikey.

57:09.960 --> 57:12.077
Fuck. Fuck.

57:13.480 --> 57:14.596
Okay.

57:16.280 --> 57:17.680
We gotta do this.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.114
Are you sure you're
doing the right thing here?

58:17.200 --> 58:19.635
No. I don't.

58:19.720 --> 58:21.677
Mikey has a tendency to get
into trouble, you know that.

58:21.760 --> 58:24.878
Don't start, Rob.
He put the lawnmower in my hand.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.191
Don't you get that?
I owe everything to him.

58:27.280 --> 58:29.954
He didn't have the big brother I had.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.190
What's taking this so long?

58:31.280 --> 58:34.432
You know, you said it would
take a couple days.

58:36.600 --> 58:38.273
What's going on, Rob?

58:39.600 --> 58:40.954
I need a few more days, okay?

58:41.040 --> 58:42.952
Well, we don't have a few more
days. No, no, no.

58:44.680 --> 58:48.390
Did you do something with my money?

58:48.480 --> 58:50.233
- I knew I could make you more.
- More?

58:50.320 --> 58:51.436
What are you saying?

58:51.520 --> 58:53.398
I put it into a house,
okay, but listen to me.

58:53.480 --> 58:55.039
It's a great fixer-upper in Gert Town.

58:55.120 --> 58:56.873
My cousin's a construction manager.
I'd make you the same return...

58:56.960 --> 58:58.440
Do you know what you're saying to me?

58:58.520 --> 59:00.398
Do you fucking know what you're saying?

59:02.440 --> 59:05.114
You going to prison
doesn't do shit for me.

59:05.200 --> 59:06.759
I don't give a fuck how you get it.

59:06.840 --> 59:11.312
I need that money by tomorrow,
or that's exactly where you're going.

59:15.800 --> 59:17.519
You know something, Mikey?

59:17.600 --> 59:20.559
I know something you don't know,
and that's that you're lucky.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.279
You wanna know why?

59:22.360 --> 59:24.431
Because tomorrow when we do the exchange,

59:24.520 --> 59:28.309
you get to find out how much
your brother really loves you.

59:28.400 --> 59:31.438
- Fuck you, Eddie.
- Yeah.

59:31.520 --> 59:33.557
I could probably learn
something from you and JP.

59:33.640 --> 59:35.438
You know, how close you are.

59:35.520 --> 59:38.115
I had a brother once. Did you know that?

59:38.200 --> 59:42.672
Yeah. I was just writing him a letter
in the car ride on the way back.

59:43.920 --> 59:46.754
You got a minute? You don't mind
if I read it to you.

59:46.840 --> 59:50.151
Maybe you can offer me some suggestions.

59:52.160 --> 59:55.597
About how to be good brothers.

59:55.680 --> 59:56.796
Sure.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.517
"Dear Buddy, sorry about today,

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.637
"but you know you always were the creature

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.475
"from The War of the Gargantuas
when it came to me!

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.754
"But you remember when we were partners?

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.440
"Had a little car-jacking operation.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.637
"When we were teens.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.355
"Cops were on us one day, we ran.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:28.072
"You got away, but I got caught. I was 17!

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.796
"They offered me community service,

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:37.160
"and all I had to do was give up
my accomplice, you, my brother.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:42.315
"But, no, I took the years.
I got out in three.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.550
"You had promised my share
would be waiting.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.072
"Then I got out, there was nobody there...

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.110
"to pick me up.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.160
"I took a goddamned bus from the prison!

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.152
"You had taken my share.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.520
"Gone to Florida.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.434
"And set up the business in New Orleans!

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.199
"With my money!

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.680
"You fucker.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.310
"And I never got those three years back.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.190
Love, Eddie."

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.436
What do you think, any good?
Should I send it?

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.752
Well, I can't send it 'cause I fucking
killed him today, all right.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.877
I hate you. I hate both of you.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.471
You're so lucky 'cause you had each other!

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.995
Well, that's the King brothers.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:47.113
That's why I can expect
something different from you.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.754
Jesus, man, I did that to you?

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.116
No, I did it.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.190
For you.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.469
It's all there.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.390
Thanks.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.629
Thanks. Hey, Luca, talk to me a second.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.075
Man, we've known each
other like 16 years now.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.075
Mikey, don't start this shit, man.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.953
I ain't letting you go.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.554
Eddie'd kill me and my baby girl.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.838
I know, I'm not asking
you to do that. I understand.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:59.391
It's just this, this not knowing.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.039
I just...

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.713
Not knowing what?

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.355
Have you seen his face?

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.319
He said he killed his brother, right?

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.232
He's never gonna give up.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.200
Even if JP pays,
he's gonna kill me, right?

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.430
Mikey, man, I gotta go.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.279
No, look, I can't change anything.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.829
I can't do anything about it.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.399
Just...

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.713
I just... I need to know.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.711
He's gonna kill me and JP,

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.919
after he gets the money, isn't he?

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.119
Is he?

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:52.996
Yeah.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.720
Tomorrow. Five p.m.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.996
We'll call you 15 minutes before.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.311
You come with cops, he's dead.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.079
I'll have the money by then.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.198
Wait, put him on the phone.
I wanna talk to him.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.710
If he's alive I wanna hear his voice.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.792
Otherwise the deal's off.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.312
We'll call you back.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:28.040
I know that JP and I didn't
go to church when we were kids,

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.033
but we didn't know any better.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.471
I know that I'm still alive,

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.920
for some reason.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.272
So if you, help me get outta this,

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.599
I promise I will go
to church with Lizzie, JP...

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.078
I'll get my little girl an education.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.800
And I'll keep trying.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.316
You hear about that little boy in Jackson?

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.629
Yeah, his genius parents

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.831
poured Drano in an old soda pop bottle,

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.389
the boy found it, drank it,
guess what happened to him?

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.153
Burned his esophagus.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.399
Started gagging.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.194
Puked up black blood
and bits of his stomach.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.920
He vomited so hard his eyes hemorrhaged,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.959
and his stomach actually dissolved.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.314
You tell JP not to pay,
or you say anything wrong,

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.279
this is all going down your throat.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.118
- JP.
- Mikey?

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.600
Are you okay?

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.275
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.272
Hey, listen, I got the money, okay?

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.113
Did they fucking hurt you again?

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.476
Don't worry about me.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.319
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.595
Just pay him and when this is over

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.639
we'll go play some video games.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.836
On me.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.559
- Yeah, okay.
- All right, that's enough.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.352
Video games?

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.432
You were always a pussy.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.113
Wait, why would he say that?

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.520
What did he say?

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.750
Video games.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.513
He's trying to tell me something.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.590
Like what?

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.711
- You sure you wanna do this?
- No.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.951
I'm still stuck on this arcade thing.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.191
I don't think that meant anything, man.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.671
- He said, "On me."
- Where does that lead you?

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.116
Mikey used to always go
to an arcade after school.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.998
And he'd throw quarters
to his friends sometimes, too,

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.833
but he never gave me any.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.151
Except this one time.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.959
When my Uncle Rich killed himself.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.675
Came home from school and he'd
shot himself in the face.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.594
Mikey he didn't want me to see,
so he gave me some quarters,

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.512
told me to go to the arcade.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.434
All right, so, what does that mean?

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.954
I don't know.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.839
I think he's trying to tell me,
something bad is gonna happen.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.470
Like they're gonna kill him
anyways, just stay away.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.916
Fucking A, they're gonna kill you both.

01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:25.238
Mikey, fuck.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:29.834
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.800
Eddie. Mikey got out of his chair.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.916
He's...

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.359
Look, he's passed out right now,

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:44.397
but he stabbed me a bunch of times, man.

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:46.471
I'm bleeding pretty bad.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.714
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah.
I'll tie him back up.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:11.910
Yeah.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.077
Money in a suitcase.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.720
Bring it to 4150 South Street.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.953
There will be a phone there
waiting there for you in Wendy's bag.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.314
I'll tell you where to go next.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:23.470
If we think you're coming with cops,

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.993
we'll fucking shoot you.

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.151
I wanna talk to him one more time.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.836
- No more stalling.
- Put him on the phone.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.673
We already gave you proof of life.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.319
It's time to make the trade.

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:37.591
Fuck you, put him on the phone.

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:50.192
You're worried about getting
stabbed by a little scrub,

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:54.274
meanwhile $350,000 almost
walks out the fucking door.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.113
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.190
I'm sorry.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.200
What do we do now?

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.473
What do we do? We raise the stakes.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.549
Don't talk, bitch.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.034
Drive.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.514
- Come on.
- Dad, what's going on?

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.876
Alexis?

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.871
- Alexis?
- See what you made me do, Mikey?

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:13.271
If you'd just stayed in that chair,
none of this would have had to happen.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.478
You're a dead man, you motherfucker.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.392
You're a fucking dead man.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.073
Alexis.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.358
- No, no, no, let me go!
- It will be all right.

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.996
Everything's going to be all right!

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.119
JP Lindell.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.032
I work for Eddie King.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.358
Mr. King would like to
have lunch with you today.

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.080
Yeah, what the fuck does
Eddie want to see me about?

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:51.638
He has a solution to your problem.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.394
Ronnie's Barbecue. 1:00.

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.800
That's why it's lunch at a public place.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.912
See, he knows you can't touch him there.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.878
- I'm gonna fucking kill him.
- And you're gonna get life.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.191
You can't do shit.

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.919
What does he want?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.231
How the fuck should I know?

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.676
Just like you can't touch him,
he can't touch you.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.229
- Not at Ronnie's.
- Fuck.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.075
Hey, you made it.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.350
Come on.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.677
It's time to settle this.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.797
You need to take this opportunity now

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.633
to free your brother, once and for all.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.194
'Cause he ain't gonna
make it if you don't.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.919
Fuck you, Eddie.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.913
Uncle Eddie, and there's no
reason for that kinda talk.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.640
Didn't your mom teach you boys
to speak with distinction?

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.120
Now I'm here because a long time ago,

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.520
your brother and I were friends.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.071
You were never friends. You used him up.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.594
You fucked the bulk of his life

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.990
before he had a chance to live it.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.878
What do you want?

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.236
Well, I heard about what
happened from some cops,

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.074
who all said to pay that money,
the 350 large.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.072
You're worth a lot of money, JP.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.719
You probably owe some
of that to your brother

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.598
for making sure you stayed on track.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.320
Yeah. I do.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.551
What the fuck do you want?

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.232
Well, your brother owes me his life.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.199
I made him, he made you.
So I figure you owe me.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.634
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.916
Well, with that kinda money,
you should pay some respects.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.912
Some tribute.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.755
You want me to just hand over $350,000.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.399
Two hundred and we'll call it even.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.597
Go fuck yourself. I don't owe you shit.

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:54.275
You know the secret to
making a great Bloody Mary?

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.794
You gotta have the right
amount of Worcestershire

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.395
to the right amount of celery.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.913
JP, Have you seen your niece recently?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.036
What did you say?

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.237
Yeah, your junkie niece,
what was her name?

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.551
Alexis? I heard she went missing.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.074
You know, with Mikey tied up,

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.992
you're probably the only thing
that girl's got to a father.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.720
So you might wanna look into where she is.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.950
What the fuck are you telling me?

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.554
Maybe check with her junkie friends.

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.472
Not that I wanna tell you
how to conduct your business,

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.792
but she is a pretty little girl.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.112
A little trashy for my tastes.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.475
A little young.

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:39.636
No, actually, she's a good age.

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.474
Are you threatening to hurt my
niece, you fucking piece of shit?

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.835
No.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.355
I'm just encouraging you
to find where she is.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.114
The street's a dangerous place.

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:54.400
All right, look, I'll be at the
back of Bones Billiards tonight.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.234
You ask for Luca at the back door.

01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:59.471
And you make sure that
you bring the money,

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.997
that your brother owes me,
and then you will fix this.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.675
All right, now I'm not hungry but...

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:08.915
lunch is on me.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:30.472
Alexis, it's your uncle, JP.
You gotta call me, okay?

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.199
As soon as you can,
I'm really worried about you.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.192
Please, please call me.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.593
Vicki!

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.796
Alexis!

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.196
Vicki?

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.670
Vicki?

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.434
Vicki? Vicki?

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.637
Oh, fuck! Vicki?

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.880
Lizzie! Lizzie!

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.076
What's going on?

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.391
Quick, get a bucket.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.516
Lizzie!

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.713
- Get a bucket.
- Okay.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.876
Vicki, Vicki.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.599
- Vicki.
- We gotta flush her out.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:21.790
Okay, come on.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.314
Wake up, come on.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.359
Wake up. Okay, she's breathing.
Quick, hurry.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:37.557
There you go. They took Alexis.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.960
They're gonna kill her.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.714
What are you doing?

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.917
JP, you can't just give it to them, okay?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.595
The cops aren't going to stop them.
Somebody has to.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.876
And you're gonna stop them.
What are you going to do?

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.759
You're telling me the world wouldn't be
better off without Eddie King?

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.590
Oh, shit. Come on.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.797
He's not going to stop, Lizzie.
First it was Mikey, then Alexis.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.440
Who's next? You, the baby?

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.113
- Let's just go.
- Go?

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.919
Yes, let's get outta here. Leave the city.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.992
- Go where?
- California?

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.278
- France, anywhere.
- And run? Hide?

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.960
No, this is my home. This is our home.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.874
Katrina didn't run us out
and neither will Eddie King.

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.280
I'm gonna get my brother back.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.760
Have you lost your fucking mind?

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.593
And what are my options? Run, hide?

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.797
It's a better option than
trying to kill Eddie King.

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.712
You want me to just give him the money?

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.153
He still might kill you anyway.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.079
He's always got muscle around him.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.117
What are you going to do? You gonna kill

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.999
three, four guys just to get to him?

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.039
Yeah. You're right.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:48.717
Hey, Sal. Thanks for everything, huh?

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.150
Mikey!

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.112
They took Alexis.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.475
You gotta get outta here.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.789
If you gave him that money,

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.916
they were gonna kill the both of us.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.117
He will hunt us down if we run.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.395
You know that.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.313
Look, I tried to protect
you from all of this.

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.750
It's my turn to protect you, big bro.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.077
We're gonna kill those motherfuckers.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.799
I got no problem with that.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.798
You made the right decision.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.873
It's all in there, 200 grand.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.555
But I need to know that you're
going to stay away from my family.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:17.510
That includes Alexis, my baby, my wife.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.836
Stay the fuck away.

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:24.756
If there's 200 Gs in there,
then you have my word.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.752
What's the combination?

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.836
Two, one, five.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.033
Hey...

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.039
I should be a celebrity chef,

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:24.238
and these barbecued ribs
should be on my show.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.676
- Need any help?
- No, I got it. Thank you.

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:29.275
I really out did myself this time.

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.760
- Looks good.
- Who's hungry?

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:33.560
Get 'em while they're hot, people.

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.832
I can help.

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.513
Oh, you're eating meat now?

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.114
I thought you were a vegetarian?

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:44.080
I could get you a tofurkey.
Some mung bean?

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.117
Why don't you quit
giving the kid a hard time.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.078
Alexis, where's your dad?

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.516
Yeah, where is that chump?

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.874
That's the year I was born.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.711
I never told ya how proud I am of you.

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:33.478
You got an arm like a cannon.

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.076
Yeah. But I could never
quite hit like you.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.355
Nope.

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.270
Wanna try?

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:02.750
See what ya got.

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.393
- Get out there.
- I'm going.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.110
Hit that train, you ready?

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.598
Come on, put it right there.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.356
That was a strike.

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.471
Nice!

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:36.233
Oh, baby, go, go, go, go!

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.112
I fucking did it!
