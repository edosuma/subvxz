Alvey: A lot of fighters
choose nicknames...

00:13.804 --> 00:16.172
"The Crippler."

00:16.207 --> 00:18.675
"The Nightmare." "Rumble."

00:18.709 --> 00:22.078
Most of them are fucking stupid.

00:22.112 --> 00:24.648
I fought a guy once called
himself the "The Fuck Stick."

00:24.682 --> 00:26.650
- That's a cock.
- [Chuckles]

00:26.684 --> 00:28.652
[Laughter]

00:29.278 --> 00:31.979
Marnix "The Fuck Stick"
Jansen. He was a Dutch fellow.

00:32.012 --> 00:34.014
He had a problem with the translation.

00:34.048 --> 00:36.717
He was a very good fighter, though.

00:36.752 --> 00:38.118
[Baby cries]

00:38.153 --> 00:40.588
I was "King" Kulina.

00:40.622 --> 00:42.923
I hated that name.

00:44.617 --> 00:47.252
My father made me take it to honor him.

00:47.286 --> 00:49.787
Fucker had cancer. What was I gonna do?

00:49.821 --> 00:52.056
[Laughter]

00:52.090 --> 00:53.491
Said we had royal blood.

00:53.526 --> 00:56.827
Liked the way the two "Ks"
sounded together. "King" Kulina.

00:56.862 --> 00:59.631
It was a bit grandiose.

00:59.665 --> 01:02.167
That was my old man.

01:04.069 --> 01:06.704
That fucker truly believed

01:06.738 --> 01:08.673
that we were blessed with royal blood,

01:08.707 --> 01:11.341
that it was special from
God, it was better than yours.

01:11.376 --> 01:14.178
[Door opens, closes]

01:14.212 --> 01:16.480
I'm talking about guy who
was too fucking mean and lazy

01:16.514 --> 01:18.182
to ever have a fucking job.

01:18.216 --> 01:20.450
I wanted to murder this motherfucker.

01:20.485 --> 01:23.587
And I had a plan when I was a kid.

01:25.523 --> 01:27.791
I didn't do it...

01:27.825 --> 01:29.759
'Cause of my mother.

01:30.995 --> 01:33.230
Sweet woman.

01:33.264 --> 01:34.731
Hmm.

01:36.201 --> 01:37.701
I guess she fell in love with him

01:37.735 --> 01:40.136
before he unzipped his asshole
and the real guy came out.

01:40.171 --> 01:42.205
- Ha!
- [Laughter]

01:44.308 --> 01:47.911
Anyway...

01:47.945 --> 01:50.580
Let's not make this about him.

01:57.454 --> 01:59.822
[Audience boos]

01:59.856 --> 02:05.394
This is about what you two
gentleman did to my son.

02:05.429 --> 02:08.698
[Laughter]

02:15.238 --> 02:17.439
You think you're gonna
make me live with something,

02:17.473 --> 02:19.742
motherfucker?

02:19.776 --> 02:23.712
You think I don't have enough shit?

02:23.747 --> 02:25.948
[Man coughs]

02:27.049 --> 02:29.317
Lower your head, please.

02:31.387 --> 02:33.221
[Audience murmurs, applause]

02:33.256 --> 02:35.089

02:35.124 --> 02:37.158

04:50.489 --> 04:52.222
That was nice.

04:52.257 --> 04:55.825
You're pretty good when
you're paying attention.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.995
You're hard to ignore.

04:58.029 --> 05:00.264
[Cellphone buzzes]

05:00.298 --> 05:02.933
Go ahead.

05:09.274 --> 05:10.874
I'm starving.

05:10.909 --> 05:12.609
You want to get some breakfast?

05:12.643 --> 05:13.910
Uh, I can't.

05:13.944 --> 05:15.678
That was my brother.

05:15.713 --> 05:17.144
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.148
Yeah, I just got to get home.

05:21.752 --> 05:23.953
Hey.

05:23.987 --> 05:28.157
You're supposed to give me a
condescending kiss on the cheek.

05:52.749 --> 05:55.884
We're gonna be late for
breakfast with my dad.

05:55.919 --> 05:58.587
What is...

05:58.621 --> 06:01.556
Hide the gun from me.

06:01.590 --> 06:03.524
Okay.

06:03.559 --> 06:05.760
What's going on?

06:05.794 --> 06:08.229
[Sighs]

06:08.264 --> 06:13.601
A couple of nights, or days,
before Nate got attacked,

06:13.635 --> 06:15.370
I was on my run.

06:15.404 --> 06:18.238
I got jumped by a couple of Mexican dudes.

06:18.273 --> 06:20.174
I was on the path. I bumped into them.

06:20.208 --> 06:21.976
It was no big deal,
but we got into it good.

06:22.010 --> 06:24.946
Couple nights ago, Nate tells me that

06:24.980 --> 06:26.848
after these guys beat the shit out of him,

06:26.882 --> 06:29.249
they said to him, "tell your
pops we said, 'what's up?'"

06:29.284 --> 06:32.252
I told the police. They
couldn't make a connection.

06:32.287 --> 06:34.321
I should... I should've pressed.

06:34.356 --> 06:35.589
I don't fucking understand.

06:35.623 --> 06:37.257
Why didn't Nate say something to us sooner?

06:37.292 --> 06:38.392
I don't know.

06:38.426 --> 06:40.560
Maybe he didn't want me
to make it worse, Lisa.

06:40.595 --> 06:42.463
I mean, he knows I'm not a rational man.

06:42.497 --> 06:44.365
Neither is his brother.

06:44.399 --> 06:46.266
- So, does Jay know?
- No.

06:46.301 --> 06:49.336
And he won't know until I tell him.

06:49.371 --> 06:50.971
Okay.

06:51.005 --> 06:53.339
10 years ago, I would have
fucking lit these guys up.

06:53.374 --> 06:55.709
I would have chopped them to pieces.

06:55.743 --> 06:57.944
How's that for growth?

06:59.547 --> 07:02.248
You need sleep.

07:02.282 --> 07:03.817
I'm gonna tell my dad we can't make it.

07:03.851 --> 07:05.685
No, no. We'll go, we'll go,
we'll go, we'll go, we'll go.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.286
No, I would love to cancel on him.

07:07.321 --> 07:08.687
He's your father.

07:08.722 --> 07:10.490
In a few years, he's gonna be dead,

07:10.524 --> 07:12.992
and you're gonna feel
terrible, so we'll go.

07:13.027 --> 07:15.361
We'll make him pick up the tab.

07:16.497 --> 07:18.731
Keith: I'm gonna go back inside now.

07:18.765 --> 07:20.666
Ryan: Go ahead, man.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.601
Are you coming, too?

07:22.636 --> 07:25.037
In a little bit.

07:25.071 --> 07:28.373
Yeah, actually, I'm
just gonna stay out here.

07:28.408 --> 07:32.310
There's a nice breeze, and
everybody else is out here.

07:33.516 --> 07:35.050
Your parents coming?

07:35.084 --> 07:36.618
Nope.

07:36.653 --> 07:38.253
Why not?

07:38.288 --> 07:40.555
'Cause they're angry with me, Keith.

07:40.589 --> 07:42.023
Still?

07:42.058 --> 07:43.725
I did some bad things.

07:43.759 --> 07:46.127
Gosh, I know, but I know you.

07:46.162 --> 07:49.731
My mom never stayed mad at me, ever.

07:49.765 --> 07:51.800
Not for nothing.

07:51.834 --> 07:54.069
'Cause you're a good guy, Keith.

07:54.103 --> 07:56.504
Just got to stay away
from they avocados, son.

07:59.140 --> 08:01.442
Way past that now.

08:01.476 --> 08:03.877
The funny thing about that is

08:03.912 --> 08:05.613
is that it wasn't even about the avocados.

08:05.647 --> 08:07.047
That's just what I got caught for.

08:07.082 --> 08:12.520
I mean, my penis touched
so many fruits that day.

08:14.089 --> 08:16.790
Where's Lisa? Is Lisa coming?

08:16.825 --> 08:19.126
I don't think so, Keith.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.794
What about the fitness guy,

08:20.829 --> 08:22.863
the one who calls you on your phone?

08:22.897 --> 08:24.564
- Alvey?
- Yeah.

08:24.599 --> 08:25.933
I don't think his coming, either.

08:25.967 --> 08:28.135
Keith, stop asking, man. You're
depressing the shit out of me.

08:28.169 --> 08:30.604
Sorry.

08:30.638 --> 08:32.171
Can we go back inside now?

08:32.206 --> 08:33.573
Sure.

08:33.607 --> 08:36.509
Do you want to do a puzzle? I
got one with humpback whales.

08:36.544 --> 08:38.410
No, thanks.

08:38.446 --> 08:40.647
Cool. We'll just take a nap or something.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.251
You can read your book, and I'll watch.

08:45.686 --> 08:48.888
Jay: Look at you, you little scamp.

08:48.922 --> 08:50.623
Where were you, huh?

08:50.657 --> 08:52.458
Don't worry about it.

08:52.492 --> 08:53.692
Don't worry about it?

08:53.727 --> 08:55.694
Did somebody take a little
trip to the boom-boom room?

08:55.729 --> 08:58.064
Is that where you were? Where
you in the boom-boom room?

08:58.098 --> 08:59.132
Was it the therapist?

08:59.166 --> 09:00.699
Did you take your clothes off

09:00.734 --> 09:02.468
and have a little game of wrestle?

09:02.502 --> 09:03.502
Her name is Tatiana.

09:03.536 --> 09:05.738
Tatiana.

09:05.772 --> 09:08.039
Aww.

09:08.074 --> 09:09.475
I am proud of you.

09:09.509 --> 09:10.976
My little baby boy.

09:11.010 --> 09:13.245
I always hoped you'd meet a good doctor.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.781
I did. I'm so damn proud of you.

09:15.815 --> 09:18.083
Having sex, growing up.

09:18.117 --> 09:19.584
Boy.

09:19.618 --> 09:20.618
Bam.

09:20.653 --> 09:22.154
I need your help this afternoon.

09:22.188 --> 09:23.755
You got to look after mom for a bit.

09:23.790 --> 09:25.523
Are you fucking kidding me? No way, dude.

09:25.557 --> 09:27.793
Dude, help me out just
for a couple hours, dude.

09:27.827 --> 09:29.928
I got to train 'cause I
got a fight tomorrow night.

09:29.962 --> 09:31.396
[Imitates explosion]

09:31.430 --> 09:32.730
You fucking with me?

09:32.765 --> 09:34.766
Lisa hooked me up with Bucky DeMarco.

09:34.801 --> 09:36.834
It's a shit-sandwich of a
deal on three-days' notice

09:36.868 --> 09:39.236
for no money, but it's a start.

09:39.271 --> 09:41.172
Yeah.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.408
That's really fast, dude.

09:43.442 --> 09:45.242
You... I mean, can you make weight?

09:45.277 --> 09:47.011
I don't have to worry about that.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.913
I'm fighting up a class.

09:48.947 --> 09:50.247
That's a bad idea.

09:50.282 --> 09:53.818
Nate, it's a terrible idea,
but I believe in myself.

09:53.852 --> 09:56.086
- How's your hand?
- My hand?

09:56.121 --> 09:58.722
My hand feels fine. I got two.

09:58.756 --> 10:00.891
Okay, is dad cornering you?

10:00.926 --> 10:03.327
Fuck no, dude. I'm unaffiliated.

10:03.361 --> 10:05.129
I got Mac in my corner.
Fuck that. I'll do it.

10:05.163 --> 10:08.665
Dude, I need you to be
here to look after mom.

10:08.700 --> 10:09.933
Help me out.

10:09.967 --> 10:14.103
[Imitates dog howling]

10:17.074 --> 10:18.308
All right.

10:18.343 --> 10:19.509
All right. Now, look.

10:19.544 --> 10:21.311
You have this whole house to yourself.

10:21.346 --> 10:23.347
Mom is locked up. Nobody's gonna be here.

10:23.381 --> 10:26.682
This castle is yours, so
you feel free to luxuriate

10:26.717 --> 10:28.852
and maybe take your pants down

10:28.886 --> 10:30.820
and masturbate in the parlor
room if you're so inclined.

10:30.855 --> 10:32.355
Fuck off, Jay. Go train.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.298
Nothing for me. I'll just take the check.

10:34.349 --> 10:36.283
- Oh, let me get this one.
- No, sir. No, sir.

10:36.318 --> 10:37.985
Please. Iâll charge it to the room.

10:38.019 --> 10:39.753
Thank you, dad. Thank you.

10:43.791 --> 10:47.093
I-I was just saying we don't
get to see enough of you.

10:47.127 --> 10:49.663
Oh, it think, uh, Lisa sees about
as much of me as she wants to.

10:49.697 --> 10:50.864
Dad.

10:50.898 --> 10:53.166
Well, what else should
I think? You never call.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.968
You don't call me, either.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.602
[Exhales sharply]

10:56.636 --> 10:59.472
Hell, I guess I could do a little better.

10:59.506 --> 11:02.942
Um, Lisa's mother used to
handle all the phone calls

11:02.977 --> 11:04.444
and fill me in later,

11:04.478 --> 11:06.946
give me a blow-by-blow
of Lisa's life...

11:06.981 --> 11:09.882
The boys and the switching majors

11:09.916 --> 11:12.718
and the bouncing around careers.

11:12.752 --> 11:14.787
- [Chuckles]
- Let's not do this.

11:14.821 --> 11:17.289
I just miss talking to you, is all.

11:17.323 --> 11:18.824
That's all I'm saying.

11:18.859 --> 11:21.760
I just want to know how you guys are doing.

11:21.795 --> 11:24.062
How's the gym?

11:24.097 --> 11:26.098
The gym is good. We're hanging in there.

11:26.132 --> 11:28.200
Oh. Lisa, you still, uh, doing the books?

11:28.234 --> 11:30.302
Oh, she does a hell of a
lot more than the books.

11:30.336 --> 11:32.404
She keeps the place
running, keeps the lights on.

11:32.438 --> 11:33.771
There is no gym without Lisa.

11:33.806 --> 11:37.309
Ah. Well, you guys look
like you're working hard.

11:37.343 --> 11:38.843
You look like a corpse. [Chuckles]

11:38.878 --> 11:40.412
[Scoffs]

11:40.446 --> 11:41.579
No, he's right, he's right.

11:41.614 --> 11:43.615
I-I actually haven't...
I haven't been sleeping.

11:43.649 --> 11:46.350
Oh, well, that's not good.
You got to manage your stress.

11:46.385 --> 11:48.720
I mean, guys our age, we're
swimming in open water.

11:48.754 --> 11:50.321
Anything could take you down...

11:50.355 --> 11:52.657
Your heart, your brain.

11:52.691 --> 11:54.626
Your own body's actively
trying to kill you.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.528
Dad, do you have to be so morbid?

11:56.562 --> 11:58.930
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:58.964 --> 12:01.532
I just... We're having a good time.

12:01.566 --> 12:04.835
Uh, we have the photographers
coming to the gym,

12:04.869 --> 12:06.837
so we should probably take off.

12:06.871 --> 12:09.106
I'll walk you out.

12:09.141 --> 12:11.808
It's too bad you're not sticking
around a little bit longer, Ron.

12:11.843 --> 12:14.478
Well, actually, uh, I
just had something cancel.

12:14.513 --> 12:16.447
You two free for dinner tomorrow?

12:16.481 --> 12:19.115
Alvey's son has a fight
tomorrow night, so, sorry.

12:19.150 --> 12:21.251
- Oh, oh, that's too bad.
- You know what?

12:21.285 --> 12:23.954
I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm
not gonna go to the fight.

12:23.988 --> 12:26.657
I'd love to have dinner with you, Ron.

12:26.691 --> 12:28.058
- You sure?
- Yeah.

12:28.092 --> 12:30.260
It'll be fun. Get out a
bit, we have a few drinks.

12:30.294 --> 12:32.062
- What do you think?
- It's... it's a deal.

12:32.096 --> 12:33.730
I'll... I'll send a car to the gym?

12:33.765 --> 12:35.265
- I'll be waiting.
- Okay, man.

12:35.299 --> 12:36.632
- All right.
- Wear a suit.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.101
- Suit?
- [Chuckling] Yeah.

12:39.203 --> 12:41.438
[Rap music playing in distance]

12:46.009 --> 12:48.211
[Sighs]

12:48.245 --> 12:50.746
[Exhales deeply]

12:53.550 --> 12:55.985
What's wrong, Keith?

12:56.019 --> 12:57.486
[Voice breaking] Nothing.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.722
[Clears throat] [Normal voice] Nothing.

12:59.756 --> 13:01.991
I just don't want you to leave.

13:03.894 --> 13:06.829
I'm coming back, man.
Just like every other day.

13:06.863 --> 13:07.862
Can I come?

13:07.897 --> 13:10.299
We've already been through this, buddy.

13:13.970 --> 13:15.704
[Inhales deeply]

13:15.738 --> 13:18.006
[Voice breaking] Yeah, I
know we've been through this,

13:18.040 --> 13:21.943
but... It's family day,

13:21.978 --> 13:24.245
and everybody has stuff
to do except for me.

13:24.279 --> 13:26.414
What are you talking about, man?

13:26.448 --> 13:29.350
Look at this badass puzzle. Come on.

13:29.384 --> 13:31.820
It's not fun to do by myself.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.187
Dude.

13:33.222 --> 13:35.156
[Sighs]

13:35.190 --> 13:37.525
What are you talking about?

13:37.559 --> 13:39.494
All right?

13:44.065 --> 13:46.434
Just wanted to do it with you.

13:49.338 --> 13:51.038
Okay, all right, man.

13:51.072 --> 13:53.040
We'll, uh... we'll hit it when I get back,

13:53.074 --> 13:56.043
and then, uh, we'll finish it up together.

13:56.077 --> 13:58.846
But, dude, you got to start
it, because I suck at these.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.282
So if you don't start it, keither,

14:02.316 --> 14:05.085
we're never gonna finish, all right?

14:05.120 --> 14:06.754
Okay, I'll set the edges,

14:06.788 --> 14:10.390
and then when you get back,
we'll do the middle together.

14:10.424 --> 14:14.894
I'm gonna save you the
orca 'cause you're a killer.

14:14.928 --> 14:18.731
Nick: Alvey, fighting
is a metaphor for life.

14:18.766 --> 14:21.668
- Oh, come on, dude.
- That's a fucking boring clichè.

14:21.702 --> 14:23.336
It's true. But you know what?

14:23.371 --> 14:26.239
In all seriousness, you know
it's the not the fight game.

14:26.274 --> 14:27.940
It's the selling tickets game.

14:27.975 --> 14:29.842
And for that, we got to tell your story.

14:29.877 --> 14:31.377
I've been burned by fuckers like you.

14:31.411 --> 14:33.146
You know I'm not gonna do that, man.

14:33.180 --> 14:34.947
You know I'm not gonna do that.

14:34.982 --> 14:37.750
We do this, I want full approval.

14:37.785 --> 14:40.119
I got to clear it with Ryan first.

14:40.154 --> 14:42.021
And when you shoot him,
don't get too close to him

14:42.056 --> 14:43.489
'cause he gets testy when he trains.

14:43.523 --> 14:44.791
- Fly on the wall.
- All right.

14:44.825 --> 14:46.525
Not even gonna know I'm there.
Let me get a picture of you.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.194
- No, no.
- Oh, come on.

14:48.228 --> 14:49.495
No, I'm very well-documented here.

14:49.529 --> 14:52.198
It's your story. We
start with you. Let's go.

14:52.232 --> 14:54.933
Wait. This side.

14:56.102 --> 14:57.303
[Camera shutter clicks]

14:57.337 --> 14:58.604
Was that so hard?

14:58.638 --> 15:00.439
- One shot?
- Yeah, that's it.

15:00.473 --> 15:02.675
There you go.

15:02.709 --> 15:04.409
Oh, yeah.

15:04.443 --> 15:05.877
I'm a handsome son of a bitch, huh?

15:05.912 --> 15:06.978
Yeah.

15:07.013 --> 15:08.046
So, what's the deal?

15:08.081 --> 15:09.715
I just grab my ankles for the camera

15:09.749 --> 15:11.616
so that Ryan looks like the fucking man?

15:11.650 --> 15:12.718
Not at all.

15:12.752 --> 15:15.153
He's here to shoot the gym, not just Ryan.

15:15.188 --> 15:16.688
Sure he is.

15:16.723 --> 15:18.924
Hey, Jay, it's up to you.

15:18.958 --> 15:21.492
It's your career, but if
the camera's pointing at you,

15:21.527 --> 15:23.228
I'd give him something to shoot.

15:23.262 --> 15:25.263
That's what I'm doing.

15:26.599 --> 15:28.233
[Cage door closes]

15:28.267 --> 15:30.268
Alvey: Don't fuck around.

15:30.302 --> 15:32.337
My guy looks better than your guy.

15:32.371 --> 15:34.739
They're going half speed.
Don't get excited, sister.

15:34.773 --> 15:36.874
You talk to Jay yet?

15:36.908 --> 15:38.067
Not yet.

15:38.009 --> 15:39.844
When you gonna do that?

15:39.878 --> 15:41.511
After his fight.

15:43.381 --> 15:45.415
Easy. Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, easy!

15:45.450 --> 15:46.659
Easy!

15:46.684 --> 15:49.319
Let him go, let him go. Let him go!

15:49.354 --> 15:50.587
Jay: You got that? You got it?

15:50.622 --> 15:51.789
Stop.

15:51.823 --> 15:53.523
[Laughs] Fuck you.

15:53.558 --> 15:56.560
Jesus Christ. Dude, don't shoot that.

15:56.594 --> 15:57.894
Get out. Jay, come here.

15:57.928 --> 15:59.263
Jay: He gave me his back.

15:59.297 --> 16:00.731
Yeah. I said "half speed."

16:00.765 --> 16:02.666
"Half speed." How come you're
not throwing your right hand?

16:02.700 --> 16:03.734
What do you mean?

16:03.768 --> 16:05.602
- Let me see it.
- Pops.

16:05.637 --> 16:07.337
Let me see your fucking hand.

16:07.372 --> 16:09.505
[Sighs, sniffs]

16:11.075 --> 16:12.375
It's fine.

16:12.409 --> 16:13.376
I'm... [winces]

16:13.410 --> 16:14.844
Yeah, it's not fine.

16:14.879 --> 16:16.712
Go put it in ice.

16:16.747 --> 16:18.214
No problem.

16:18.249 --> 16:20.316
Your fucking fighter's got a busted hand.

16:22.286 --> 16:24.954
Lisa: Hey, in my office.
I want to talk to you.

16:24.989 --> 16:26.822
I'm calling Bucky, and we're
pulling out of this fight.

16:26.856 --> 16:28.056
No, no.

16:28.091 --> 16:29.124
When did this happen?

16:29.159 --> 16:30.526
It happened a couple days ago sparring.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.927
I already spoke to Mac,
and he's gonna give me

16:31.961 --> 16:32.995
something to get through this.

16:33.029 --> 16:34.397
You're already fighting at welterweight.

16:34.431 --> 16:35.798
I'm not sending you in there one-handed.

16:35.832 --> 16:37.199
Hey.

16:37.233 --> 16:39.234
I fought way fucking worse.

16:39.269 --> 16:40.869
And it might shock you to believe, Lisa,

16:40.904 --> 16:42.271
but I don't have health insurance,

16:42.305 --> 16:44.072
so I'm gonna say I hurt
my hand in the fight,

16:44.107 --> 16:46.408
and Bucky's insurance is gonna cover it.

16:47.677 --> 16:49.611
That's actually not a bad idea.

16:49.645 --> 16:53.282
This fucking weigh-in is in a few hours.

16:53.316 --> 16:56.084
I don't want to fuck around anymore.

16:56.119 --> 16:59.421
You try and pull me out of
this thing, I'm going anyway.

since I've done one of these.

Yeah?

like maybe this goes right...

No.

Jay are two different guys.

20:38.568 --> 20:41.104
Jay... He's used to adversity.

20:41.138 --> 20:44.340
His whole fucking life is adversity.

20:46.710 --> 20:49.578
You should close your
eyes after Ryan leaves.

- You mean my dad?
- Yeah.

You know, I don't know him
very well, but he seems... Off.

It's 'cause the whole world

21:03.894 --> 21:06.694
doesn't revolve around him anymore.

21:06.729 --> 21:10.732
He just wants to remind
me how I veered off-course.

You do not have to go to
dinner with him, by the way.

21:13.869 --> 21:15.404
No, no, no.

Jay. I have nothing to do.

to say, motherfucker?!

put your hands on me.

put a fucking finger on me,

44:17.870 --> 44:20.272
It's a dark, dark road.

44:23.843 --> 44:27.079
It's a conversation, sweetheart.

44:27.114 --> 44:29.715
Eventually you got to forgive him.

44:36.789 --> 44:39.324
Come here.

44:39.358 --> 44:41.994
Come here.

44:45.998 --> 44:47.665
How did Jay do?

44:47.699 --> 44:48.733
[Sighs] He won.

44:48.767 --> 44:50.468
He won.

44:50.503 --> 44:53.238
Seriously, if that kid
can keep his shit together,

44:53.272 --> 44:55.140
he's gonna be something special.

44:55.174 --> 44:57.074
Well, that is... That's a big if.

44:57.109 --> 44:58.976
You would have been proud of him.

44:59.011 --> 45:00.678
Yeah.

45:00.712 --> 45:03.480
How'd it go with my dad?

45:04.683 --> 45:07.417
[Chuckling] Your dad... Is fun.

45:07.452 --> 45:08.919
- Oh, yeah.
- He is.

45:08.954 --> 45:10.021
[Laughs]

45:10.055 --> 45:11.989
He misses your mother.

45:12.024 --> 45:13.423
So do I.

45:13.458 --> 45:15.225
Yeah.

45:15.260 --> 45:17.094
Fun.

45:18.530 --> 45:21.698
- You okay?
- Yeah.

45:23.301 --> 45:25.669
- I missed you.
- Mmm.

45:27.372 --> 45:30.073
- How much?
- A lot.

45:30.107 --> 45:31.841
- What are you gonna do?
- [Chuckles]

45:39.283 --> 45:40.616
Hi. Oh.

45:40.651 --> 45:42.585
Hey, you're not scheduled today.

45:42.619 --> 45:44.620
I know. Can I talk to you, please?

45:44.655 --> 45:46.455
About what?

45:46.490 --> 45:48.725
- Can I talk to you?
- About what?

45:48.759 --> 45:50.560
I'm sorry.

45:52.796 --> 45:54.797
I wanted to apologize.

45:56.833 --> 45:58.367
Hey.

46:02.539 --> 46:04.006
For what?

46:04.040 --> 46:07.283
For not being around, not
calling back, for everything.

46:07.311 --> 46:08.877
Yeah, I don't like to
get fucked and dodged.

46:08.912 --> 46:10.078
That doesn't feel good.

46:10.113 --> 46:12.347
[Sighs]

46:12.381 --> 46:17.019
Okay, look, you're
probably a good guy, Nate.

46:17.053 --> 46:18.887
Or I don't know. Maybe you're not.

46:18.922 --> 46:22.791
Maybe you're just a quiet asshole and
it takes a little longer to see it.

46:23.860 --> 46:27.529
Either way, I crossed a
line that I never cross,

46:27.563 --> 46:30.064
and it's affecting your treatment.

46:30.099 --> 46:32.767
That makes me a bad P.T.,

46:32.801 --> 46:34.561
and that makes me feel like a stupid girl.

46:34.570 --> 46:37.872
So Diego's gonna handle
your treatment from now on.

46:37.906 --> 46:40.342
I didn't mean to disrespect you.

46:40.376 --> 46:43.903
All right, there's...
There's just a lot going on,

46:43.912 --> 46:45.655
and I... And I can't tell you about it.

46:45.680 --> 46:48.816
That's okay. I believe you. I
really hope you figure it out.

46:50.552 --> 46:52.287
I got to work.

46:59.494 --> 47:01.695
[Sighs]

47:05.500 --> 47:07.501
[Man speaks indistinctly over P.A.]

47:08.737 --> 47:12.239
Ryan: My family won't talk to me.

47:12.274 --> 47:17.911
I call my mom, and, uh,
she just won't call me back.

47:17.945 --> 47:19.379
And it's fine.

47:19.413 --> 47:21.748
You know, I thought I was used to that.

47:21.783 --> 47:23.616
But, um...

47:26.620 --> 47:28.889
Just, uh...

47:30.191 --> 47:34.360
It was just one year.

47:34.395 --> 47:39.465
Like, just one fucking year,
and it just got away from me.

47:41.935 --> 47:47.639
And... I feel like if I could
just talk to them, you know...

47:50.110 --> 47:52.978
I don't know, even just my mom,

47:53.013 --> 47:54.680
then it would help.

47:57.284 --> 47:59.518
Maybe they're not ready.

48:01.188 --> 48:03.608
Doesn't mean they don't think about you.

48:05.224 --> 48:07.158
You haven't talk to them, have you?

48:08.227 --> 48:11.430
- No. It's been years.
- Yeah.

48:11.464 --> 48:13.598
I was talking to your
mom for a while after,

48:13.633 --> 48:19.037
but then it just sort of seemed
like, "where is this going?"

48:25.177 --> 48:27.212
Does Alvey know you're here?

48:28.380 --> 48:30.301
Lisa: Yeah.

48:30.316 --> 48:32.345
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

48:37.756 --> 48:39.223
[Can slams]

48:39.257 --> 48:41.925
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

48:41.960 --> 48:43.394
Hello.

48:43.428 --> 48:44.428
Keith?

48:44.463 --> 48:46.564
- Keith.
- Lisa Prince.

48:46.598 --> 48:48.131
Yeah, that's right.

48:48.166 --> 48:50.655
Listen, um, we can all
hang out some other time,

48:50.669 --> 48:52.470
but Lisa and I were just having

48:52.504 --> 48:55.973
a really private, personal conversation.

48:56.007 --> 48:59.276
So maybe I can meet you back in the room?

48:59.310 --> 49:01.211
Is that cool?

49:03.948 --> 49:05.916
Here you go.

49:08.419 --> 49:11.153
- Hey, Lisa?
- Yeah.

49:12.556 --> 49:13.823
Oh, no.

49:13.858 --> 49:15.258
- What the fuck are you doing, man?
- No, no.

49:15.292 --> 49:16.639
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm good, thank you.

49:16.660 --> 49:18.194
- I put my dick on the table.
- Okay, p-pull your pants...

49:18.228 --> 49:19.962
- She knows what I'm doing.
- I get it. Okay. Pull your pants up.

49:19.997 --> 49:21.964
Pull your fucking pants
up, dude. Come on. Keith.

49:21.999 --> 49:23.266
Put my dick on the table.

49:23.300 --> 49:25.568
[Snaps fingers] Keith,
you can't do that, man.

49:25.603 --> 49:26.608
You told me to!

49:26.636 --> 49:28.170
- Pull your pants up.
- You hit Michael,

49:28.205 --> 49:30.873
and then you fucked a girl in
the bathroom, and then I'm...

49:30.908 --> 49:32.008
Keith, Keith.

49:32.042 --> 49:33.842
I didn't make up "dick on the table."

49:33.877 --> 49:35.644
You said it! And we... I told you...

49:35.678 --> 49:37.380
Why are you being like this? Why are you...

49:37.414 --> 49:38.381
Jesus, Keith.

49:38.415 --> 49:40.616
This is fucking B.S.

49:40.650 --> 49:42.618
I am so sorry.

49:42.652 --> 49:43.786
Keith.

49:43.820 --> 49:45.287
- Why can't I do it?!
- Come on, let's go.

49:45.321 --> 49:46.855
You did this! You did this!

49:46.890 --> 49:48.690
Keith, we talked about this, man.

49:48.725 --> 49:51.092
Use your fucking head,
dude. What are you doing?

49:51.127 --> 49:52.634
You told me to use my dick.

49:52.662 --> 49:55.063
Just go... Just go back.

49:55.097 --> 49:56.965
There you go, buddy.

50:03.705 --> 50:06.241
It's fine. Not like I
haven't seen one before.

50:06.275 --> 50:08.376
I swear to God. Oh, my God.

50:08.411 --> 50:10.178
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

50:10.212 --> 50:12.213
No, it's not fucking fine.

50:14.050 --> 50:16.283
This fucking place, um...

50:16.318 --> 50:19.587
[Sighs]

50:19.621 --> 50:21.823
Is, um...

50:21.857 --> 50:24.091
Fucking grinding me.

50:26.394 --> 50:27.528
Um...

50:27.563 --> 50:29.597
You know, I was thinking

50:29.631 --> 50:33.800
maybe I could call your mom
and just see what she says.

50:35.703 --> 50:37.938
Yeah, thank you.

50:40.241 --> 50:41.741
Okay.

50:44.645 --> 50:46.113
Okay.
