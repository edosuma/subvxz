18:06.553 --> 18:08.154
Charlie Gully-type
blood situation.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.390
Think less bloodletting
and more blood-unifying,

18:10.423 --> 18:11.424
like a sacrament.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.592
What Dad does is always

18:12.625 --> 18:14.327
a theatrical manifestation
of his character.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.095
-Wow.
-[laughs]

18:16.129 --> 18:17.464
-Authentic Ricky Rabies.
-[Ace] Awesome.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.432
I love having my family with me
when I work.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.801
Crystal, can you point them
to a sink?

18:21.835 --> 18:23.536
-That one?
-Prop room.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.637
Oh, I know where that is.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.705
-Come on.
-All right. All right.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.140
-Let's go. Scoot.
-Very good.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.441
I wanna watch you walk
out of this room, girl.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.876
[Vicky]
Oh, baby, you're so good to me.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.311
[Ricky] Look at you.
What's that saying?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.813
I hate to watch you
walk away...

18:33.847 --> 18:35.114
What the fuck?

18:35.148 --> 18:37.650
There's a bunch of people out there
with Ricky Rabies shirts on.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.552
This is supposed to be
my night, my comeback,

18:39.586 --> 18:41.621
and you're wrestling
Ricky fucking Rabies?

18:41.654 --> 18:43.323
I mean, forget about
what you put on the poster.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.457
That's the main event.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.192
You're in
the main fucking event, Jack.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.393
You see how old he is?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.761
He can't go like that anymore.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.363
He's not a main event guy.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.898
You said this was
supposed to be my night.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.601
He is an opening act, Ace.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.636
He's a draw.
Brings people in the door.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.538
They're here for him.
They see you shine.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.873
They come back for you.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.708
-[Vicky] Oh, hey.
-[Jack] Hey.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.176
Sorry. Left my bag in here.

19:03.209 --> 19:04.244
[Jack] That's okay.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.712
Hey, just focus on your promo.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.347
Make 'em cheer for you.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.617
Or boo, even.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.918
What?

19:12.151 --> 19:14.621
You know, Crystal, this blood-making
thing's a bit of a process.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.356
You wanna give me a hand?

19:18.191 --> 19:20.927
Sure. Happy to.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.729
You just gotta trust me.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.403
-Hey.
-[Jack] Yep.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.605
What's it mean when, uh...

19:32.639 --> 19:34.340
someone's boots ain't scuffed,
again?

19:34.374 --> 19:37.377
Means they're a bad partner
in the ring.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.511
Don't be.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.783
[laughter]

19:43.816 --> 19:45.718
Adam and I just bought a house
in Alpharetta.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.520
A lot of my decorating clients
live over near there.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.689
What actually does being
an interior decorator entail?

19:49.722 --> 19:51.591
Besides, um,
decorating interiors?

19:51.624 --> 19:53.259
I will punch you.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.194
It's all about saving people
from their bad taste.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.563
I wouldn't have got a bid
at Chi O

19:56.596 --> 19:57.764
if you hadn't dressed me
freshman year.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.799
Easy to do when my aunt owns
a clothing store.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.201
Easier when you got
a hot fucking bitch like Staci

20:02.235 --> 20:03.536
who looks great in everything.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.438
-You're hot.
-Yes, I am hot.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.407
-Literally hot. Yes.
-[laughter]

20:07.440 --> 20:10.376
Her aunt had to club a little baby seal
for me to have what I got on.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.411
-[laughter]
-Okay.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.779
Speaking of babies,

20:12.812 --> 20:14.747
how old's that little cutie pie
Thomas now?

20:14.781 --> 20:15.949
He just turned eight.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.351
You have an eight-year-old,
and I have no man

20:18.384 --> 20:20.253
remotely interested
in impregnating me.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.487
That's not true.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.889
Fate wants me barren.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.657
Hey, nobody talks
about my friends like that.

20:24.691 --> 20:28.795
Stace, are you and Jack gonna double down
and have another baby?

20:28.828 --> 20:30.263
Oh, Stace,
we should split this.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.432
Don't be ridiculous.
Y'all came all this way.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.401
Mrs. Spade,
the apps are on the house.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.403
I served you
on your anniversary,

20:37.437 --> 20:40.306
and it's a real honor
to serve Mrs. Jack Spade again.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.507
Yeah. Well, thank you.

20:41.541 --> 20:44.510
Y'all heading over to the-the Dome
to watch the big match?

20:44.544 --> 20:47.413
I tried to get my shift covered,
but I got no pull here.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.549
You just gotta tell me
what's gonna happen.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.417
Is Jack gonna screw
someone else over?

20:51.451 --> 20:53.553
-[laughs nervously]
-[Jamie] Is Ace done for?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.355
There's a wrestling match
in town tonight.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.522
It's kind of rinky-dink.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.659
Her husband, Jack Spade,
runs the league.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.260
Wait, I thought
only his dad did that.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.763
Well, he's just trying to keep
his daddy's business going.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.031
It's been a tough year.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.333
Oh, my God. We're so going.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.502
-Oh, yeah.
-No. We don't have to go.

21:09.535 --> 21:10.703
Jamie, round of go cups.

21:10.737 --> 21:11.938
I sure will.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.640
-[laughter]
-Okay, we're going.

21:13.673 --> 21:14.907
[Whitney] Drink up, bitches.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.743

21:39.932 --> 21:41.934
[Bobby laughs]

21:41.968 --> 21:43.436
Are you surprised?

21:43.469 --> 21:45.471
Surprised you put
a Smirnoff Ice

21:45.505 --> 21:46.739
in my urinal for me to piss on?

21:46.773 --> 21:48.574
Yeah.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.510
-Yeah.
-Yes.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.578
[laughs]

21:52.612 --> 21:53.946
Well, hold on. You gotta dr--

21:55.481 --> 21:57.316
Well, you gotta--I'll get it.
Hold on.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.852
[distant cheering]

21:59.886 --> 22:00.887
Yeah, I probably--

22:00.920 --> 22:03.856
I guess I didn't really
think that through.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.559
But here you go.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.361
You got iced.
[chuckles]

22:09.796 --> 22:12.498
I thought that was
main event Ice.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.667
My ass in the main event?

22:14.701 --> 22:18.371
Man, I was just trying to--
[laughs nervously]

22:18.404 --> 22:19.405
Yeah, sorry.

22:19.439 --> 22:22.408
Um...I'll just rinse it off--

22:22.442 --> 22:23.876
In the same place we wash
our damn hands?

22:23.910 --> 22:25.745
[Bobby] Well, I don't--
where should I--

22:25.778 --> 22:28.715
-Take that shit over there!
-I'm sorry.

22:28.748 --> 22:29.816

It's not his fault.

as a bag of dicks?

22:33.586 --> 22:35.621
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Roo,
come on, now.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.024
That's gender-shaming, man.
[laughs]

22:38.057 --> 22:40.426
Dicks ain't predestined
to be dumb.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.696
It's more appropriate to say
that it's the willful idiocy

22:43.730 --> 22:47.967
of certain specific dumbasses
attached to an individual dick

22:48.000 --> 22:50.436
that makes a dick dumb.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.005
[clears throat]
Just saying, man. Shit.

22:53.039 --> 22:56.509
I'm saying it's not his fault
he got picked to wrestle Ace.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.978
So instead of being
a total asshole to Bobby

22:59.011 --> 23:00.613
for no reason,

23:00.646 --> 23:02.682
you could do
like I already told you.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.916
Go talk to Jack.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.085
Ah, come on, Poc.

23:06.119 --> 23:08.020
Look, Jack is not sitting or standing

23:08.054 --> 23:11.758
anytime, anywhere where it appears
that he is available

23:11.791 --> 23:13.526
for anything like talking.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.828
Ask Willie. Schedule it.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.967
Look, I could just use a push.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.804
Yeah, well, I'm gonna need
more than a push

23:24.837 --> 23:26.606
for this shit I'm about to take.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.074
Y'all gonna wanna clear out.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.642
Yeah, I saw what he had
for breakfast.

23:29.675 --> 23:31.711
-He had a lot.
-[laughter]

23:31.744 --> 23:33.479
[Diego] I'd clear out
the locker room, too.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.014

-[Diego] Clear the Dome!

23:35.047 --> 23:36.415

-[Crystal] Wow.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.189
That really works.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.891
Well, being with Ricky so long,

23:44.924 --> 23:46.592
got a couple tricks
up my sleeve.

23:46.626 --> 23:49.462
A valet's job's figuring out
what her man needs.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.464
You know, they just wanna feel
like you're there for them.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.533
Like, I know when Ricky gets
real grumpy,

23:53.566 --> 23:55.701
all he really needs
is a shoulder rub.

23:55.735 --> 23:56.969
Human touch.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.504
