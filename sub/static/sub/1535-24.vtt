WEBVTT

00:06.605 --> 00:09.808
Can you believe it's been
five years since our first date?

00:09.810 --> 00:12.378
I know.

00:12.380 --> 00:17.282
Do you think I should start
watching <i> The Flash</i> TV show?

00:20.387 --> 00:23.088
That's what
you're thinking about?

00:23.090 --> 00:25.024
Well, one of the things.

00:25.026 --> 00:28.494
Are any of them me?

00:28.496 --> 00:29.528
Yes.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.263
I thought, "I can't decide

00:31.265 --> 00:33.165
"if I should watch
<i>The Flash</i> TV show.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.067
I know, I'll ask Amy."

00:36.336 --> 00:38.404
Anyway...

00:39.873 --> 00:41.673
What are you doing?

00:41.675 --> 00:44.510
You're right, you did
kind of kill the mood.

00:45.478 --> 00:46.879
I didn't kill anything.

00:46.881 --> 00:49.815
You did, talking about
your stupid TV show.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.517
Excuse me.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.553
Starting to watch a television
show that might run for years

00:54.555 --> 00:56.021
isn't a decision
to take lightly.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.623
I'm wrestling with

00:57.625 --> 00:59.458
a big commitment issue here.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.893
Really?

01:00.895 --> 01:04.629
That's the commitment issue
you're wrestling with?

01:04.632 --> 01:05.898
Sheldon,

01:05.900 --> 01:07.733
do you understand the irony

01:07.735 --> 01:10.135
of your fixation on a man
with super speed,

01:10.137 --> 01:12.871
while after five years
all I can get out of you

01:12.873 --> 01:15.441
is a distracted make-out session
on a couch?

01:17.010 --> 01:19.311
Irony's not really
my strong suit.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.247
But I have been getting better
with sarcasm,

01:22.249 --> 01:24.616
if you want to give that a try.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.119
(sarcastically):
Oh, sure, I'd love to.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.856

01:59.352 --> 02:00.953
I don't want to rush you,

02:00.955 --> 02:02.888
but I'm closing
a little early tonight.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.057
Ooh. Hot date?

02:05.059 --> 02:07.493
Uh, no. I overheard
Bernadette tell Howard

02:07.495 --> 02:09.061
she was making him a meat loaf,

02:09.062 --> 02:11.463
and you don't have
to not ask me twice.

02:13.066 --> 02:16.335
If I stick a lightbulb on this,
wouldn't it make a great lamp

02:16.337 --> 02:18.737
for my bedroom?

02:18.739 --> 02:21.507
You're kidding, right?

02:21.509 --> 02:23.542
Oh. Is this freaking you out?

02:23.544 --> 02:26.478
I guess I'm just more
of a Pottery Barn,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.380
Crate and Barrel kind of guy.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.351
Maybe Pier 1
if I really want to cut loose.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.053
All right. Never mind.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.022
No, no, no.
Hey, you should totally get it.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.524
In fact, I'll buy it for you.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.825
Sold!

02:41.861 --> 02:43.896
Raj, you don't have to do that.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.664
Too late!
No returns!

02:48.067 --> 02:50.936
That was really intense.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.739
Well, now we know, next time
we go to the farmers' market,

02:53.741 --> 02:57.809
the order is petting zoo first,
then buy vegetables.

03:00.713 --> 03:02.381
Hey.

03:02.383 --> 03:05.050
Oh, good. You're here.
I need your assistance.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.653
Can it wait until I put
a Band-Aid on a goat bite?

03:09.289 --> 03:10.956
What happened?
Oh.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.392
Your buddy got mugged
by some baby farm animals.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.395
Been there.
Mmm.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.330
So what do you need help with?

03:18.332 --> 03:21.500
Amy's mad at me,
and I'm not clear why.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.835
Okay. Were you talking
before she got upset?

03:23.837 --> 03:25.370
Yes.
That's probably it.

03:26.339 --> 03:28.473
What'd you say to her?

03:28.475 --> 03:30.642
Well, I just asked her
if I should start watching

03:30.644 --> 03:32.344
the new <i> Flash</i> TV series.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.845
And that made her angry?

03:33.847 --> 03:35.847
Baffling, right? We were necking

03:35.849 --> 03:38.684
like a couple of hooligans
under the school bleachers.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.320
I stopped so I could ask
the question.

03:41.322 --> 03:46.058
Next thing I know, good-bye,
kissy face. Hello, yelly face.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.193
Well, Sheldon, when
you're kissing a girl,

03:48.195 --> 03:50.596
she expects the
attention to be on her.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.264
It was. I asked her

03:52.266 --> 03:54.933
if <i> she</i> thought
I should watch <i> The Flash.</i>

03:54.935 --> 03:58.170
Yeah. I'm tapping out.
Leonard?

03:58.172 --> 04:00.572
I'm gonna guess that your main
concern is the time commitment

04:00.574 --> 04:02.941
of watching an entire season
of a new show.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.276
Oh, no, not just a season.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.278
If I'm in,
I'm in for the whole run,

04:06.280 --> 04:09.147
even if the quality declines.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.850
I get it.
<i>Smallville</i> almost wrecked you.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.586
Yeah. Exactly.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.921
You know, I waited ten years

04:15.923 --> 04:18.423
to see a guy
everyone knows can fly, fly.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.759
Wait, what is wrong
with you two?

04:20.761 --> 04:23.328
He was talking about television
during their date night.

04:23.330 --> 04:26.331
Oh, not just date night...
Our fifth anniversary.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.133
Okay, see, that's even dumber
than you wondering

04:28.135 --> 04:31.703
if being bitten by a goat would
give you the powers of a goat.

04:33.806 --> 04:36.141
If that happens,
don't make me wait ten years

04:36.143 --> 04:38.277
to watch you eat a tin can.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.782
You guys ever notice that Emily
has a bit of a twisted side?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.684
You mean
'cause she has weird tattoos?

04:45.686 --> 04:48.654
No, because she wants to have
sex with me in a graveyard.

04:50.657 --> 04:53.625
One more time?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.627
She and I were supposed to watch

04:55.629 --> 04:57.696
the new <i> Avengers</i> movie tonight,
but it was sold out.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.865
So I said,
"What else do you want to do?"

04:59.867 --> 05:01.433
She said,
"Let's go to a cemetery

05:01.435 --> 05:03.969
and do it on somebody's grave."

05:03.971 --> 05:08.473
Like, a random person
or somebody she knew?

05:08.475 --> 05:11.343
What difference
does it make?

05:11.345 --> 05:12.944
Well, if it's

05:12.946 --> 05:14.746
her father's grave
and they didn't get along,

05:14.748 --> 05:16.982
then you know
she holds a grudge.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.852
The only issue is that everybody
has their own thing.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.487
And as long
as it's two consenting adults,

05:22.489 --> 05:24.356
I guess
I don't see the harm in it.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.957
Well, what if it's
one consenting adult

05:25.959 --> 05:27.592
and one adult who
pretends to consent

05:27.594 --> 05:29.261
because he's afraid
of being alone?

05:30.930 --> 05:32.764
Well, then I guess
bring a blanket.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.633
The grass gets damp at night.

05:36.869 --> 05:38.303
I don't know, guys.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.272
Maybe this relationship
isn't for me.

05:40.274 --> 05:42.474
Maybe I should break up
with her.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.376
(chuckles) Right. You're gonna
break up with a girl

05:44.378 --> 05:46.945
who has sex with you.
Can you believe this guy?

05:46.947 --> 05:51.083
I think if Raj wants to break up
with a girl, he can do it.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.884
How are you saying that
with a straight face?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.920
(chuckling):
I don't know.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.090
You guys are being jerks.

05:58.092 --> 06:00.392
Buddy, other than Jenny Craig,

06:00.394 --> 06:03.061
you've never broken up
with a girl in your life.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.296
You're one
to talk.

06:04.298 --> 06:05.497
You've been complaining
about Stuart

06:05.499 --> 06:06.832
living here for the past year.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.467
I don't see you showing him
the door.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.701
That's not the
same thing.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.069
Emily's a person.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.738
Stuart's more like
an infestation,

06:12.740 --> 06:14.106
something you spray for.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.075
Baloney, okay?
You two are

06:17.077 --> 06:19.878
as afraid of hurting
someone's feelings as I am.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.247
That's not true. We were just
laughing right in your face.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.652
Thanks for cooking.
Mmm.
My pleasure.

06:27.654 --> 06:30.722
That carrot
was delicious.
Yeah.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.091
I wish I'd fought harder
for the rest of 'em.

06:36.996 --> 06:38.997
Still haven't heard
from her?

06:38.999 --> 06:41.533
No, and I'm confused.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.668
It's been nearly 24 hours.

06:43.670 --> 06:47.305
Amy should have figured out
she's wrong by now.

06:48.641 --> 06:50.175
Hey, I don't think she's wrong

06:50.177 --> 06:52.377
about you going too slow
in the relationship.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.712
Too slow?

06:53.714 --> 06:54.880
Yeah, you've been
going out

06:54.882 --> 06:56.848
for years.
You haven't even slept together.

06:56.850 --> 07:00.018
That's right.
It's called foreplay.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.422
And I could make the case

07:03.424 --> 07:06.024
that you two aren't moving
forward in your relationship.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.125
(scoffs)
Uh,

07:07.127 --> 07:08.860
hello.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.396
Hello.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.437
No. Sheldon,
we're getting married.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.806
But you've been engaged
for over a year now,

07:20.808 --> 07:22.374
and you don't even have
a wedding date.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.443
Well, we will. We're
just not in a rush.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.378
Okay.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.115
We're gonna set a date.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.851
Okay. If you say so.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.586
Yeah, it's just, things
are good right now.
Really good.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.788
I'm focusing on my job.
And we've been busy
with our paper.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.990
So busy.
Yeah, we'll pick a date
when we pick a date.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.058
Yeah.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.228
Okay.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.297
You know, I can see
why Amy's mad at you.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.765
Yeah, shut up,
Sheldon!

07:49.502 --> 07:51.670
Did you eat
all my yogurt?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.805
You mean the one that
makes ladies do the thing

07:53.807 --> 07:55.207
that ladies pretend
they don't do

07:55.209 --> 07:57.876
even though they do?

07:59.879 --> 08:01.947
You know...

08:01.949 --> 08:04.583
which yogurt I mean.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.419
I didn't touch it.
Must have been Stuart.

08:07.421 --> 08:09.287
(sighs)
Maybe Raj is right.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.690
Maybe it's time we tell him
he needs to move out.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.558
We should have done
it months ago.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.160
I know, but his store
was reopening,

08:15.162 --> 08:17.696
and then there were the
holidays, and then he was sick.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.130
(groans)
Yeah, right.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.333
Sick. He didn't have jaundice.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.602
He just looks like that.

08:28.741 --> 08:31.409
All right.
Tonight's the night.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.611
Agreed.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.113
When he gets home, I'm
dropping the hammer.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.115
Ooh, I like
when you take charge.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.351
Oh, I'm not taking charge...
You're the hammer.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.193
So...

08:48.195 --> 08:50.495
why haven't we
picked a date?

08:50.497 --> 08:51.530
You know why.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.998
Well, of course I know why.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.733
But just for fun... why?

08:56.168 --> 08:58.837
Not in a rush, busy with work...

08:58.839 --> 09:01.306
Things are good
right now.
Really good.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.075
You still want
to get married, right?

09:04.077 --> 09:06.378
Oh, my God. Yes.
Why would you even ask that?

09:06.380 --> 09:08.179
I don't know.
Because we don't have a date?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.448
Well, you want a date,
pick a date.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.716
It's not just the date.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.151
We haven't talked
about anything.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.020
Big wedding, small wedding,
indoor, outdoor...

09:15.022 --> 09:20.225
Outdoor? Oh.
I can RSVP no right now.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.460
Okay, indoor it is.
Big or small?

09:22.462 --> 09:24.195
Is your dad paying for it?
I doubt it.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.798
Okay, two friends each.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.601
All right, well,
I want it in a church.

09:29.603 --> 09:30.936
Fine. I want black-tie.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.938
Fine.
I want to release butterflies.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.307
Seriously? Airborne worms?

09:36.776 --> 09:38.777
Okay. Well, then it's settled:

09:38.779 --> 09:41.479
small indoor church wedding,
black-tie, no butterflies.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.747
Sounds perfect.
Great.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.418
You still
didn't pick a date.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.253
Stay out of it!
Shut up!

09:53.259 --> 09:55.961
Mmm. It's a beautiful night.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.829
Oh, yes, we've
got the moon

09:57.831 --> 09:59.598
and the trees and...

09:59.600 --> 10:01.633
Elizabeth McNulty,

10:01.635 --> 10:04.769
who apparently died
when she was the same age I am.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.274
Makes you feel
alive, doesn't it?

10:09.276 --> 10:11.977
So does enjoying a meal
at a well-lit restaurant,

10:11.979 --> 10:14.479
but here we are.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.415
You aren't scared, are you?

10:17.417 --> 10:20.051
Of ghosts, no.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.487
Of you, little bit.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.325
I'm sorry I've
upset you.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.327
I shouldn't have asked
so many questions.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.562
No, it's okay.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.063
Yeah, maybe it's good
you got us

10:32.065 --> 10:33.999
talking about this stuff.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.667
Well, look at that...

10:35.669 --> 10:39.838
Even when I'm causing problems,
I make the world a better place.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.041
Hey, next, why don't we tackle
your penchant for whining

10:43.043 --> 10:45.910
and Penny's love
of the ol' glug-glug?

10:49.415 --> 10:51.216
Uh, Sheldon, I think
we're good for now.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.584
Ah, well... very well.

10:52.586 --> 10:54.986
So does this mean you'll
finally pick a wedding date?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.988
(sighs)
Here we go again.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.758
Why is everyone so concerned
with us setting a date?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.192
We're committed to
each other. We're happy.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.628
A ceremony isn't gonna
change anything.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.164
So you're never getting married?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.867
It's his whining, isn't it?

11:08.869 --> 11:11.636
Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.

11:14.774 --> 11:17.008
It's amusing
that he doesn't hear it.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.312
Look, all she's saying
is we are in love

11:21.314 --> 11:22.781
so it doesn't matter
if we get married

11:22.783 --> 11:26.051
tomorrow or a year from now
or 50 years from now.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.753
Ew, 50?
We'll be old and gross.

11:28.755 --> 11:31.423
Yeah, but we'll be old
and gross together.

11:31.425 --> 11:32.824
SHELDON:
My aunt and uncle

11:32.826 --> 11:35.160
were married 63 years.

11:35.162 --> 11:38.129
Towards the end, it was
like watching cheese melt.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.074

11:49.008 --> 11:51.876
Um... I'm
free tonight.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.417
Are you saying
you want to get married?

11:59.419 --> 12:02.053
Vegas isn't
that far away.

12:03.022 --> 12:04.489
I'm in. Let's do it.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.091
(squeals quietly)

12:11.797 --> 12:13.932
After all these years.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.868
I'm really happy
for the two of you.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.036
Oh, thank you.
Thanks.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.138
Now get out of my spot.

12:23.542 --> 12:26.311
Bernie, Stuart just pulled up.

12:27.113 --> 12:28.446
So remember,

12:28.448 --> 12:30.181
the key is to be firm.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.382
Show no weakness.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.885
Right.
Good luck.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.254
Howard Joel Wolowitz,
you get back here.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.358
(mutters) Never should have
told you my middle name.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.695
Hey, guys.
Hey, you got
a minute?

12:43.697 --> 12:46.698
Sure. Uh, let me just put
this stuff in the fridge.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.967
I felt bad for finishing
your yogurt, so I bought more.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.169
And, Howard, your favorite
fruit is in season.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.837
Crunch Berries.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.741
Don't let that sway you.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.944
It's hard not to. They taste so
much better than real berries.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.548
What's up?

13:03.550 --> 13:06.050
So... we need to talk.

13:08.888 --> 13:11.122
You okay?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.625
I think we should talk.

13:14.994 --> 13:16.694
Is everything okay?

13:17.763 --> 13:20.565
Well... you've been
living here a while now.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.901
I know.
I may sell comic books at work,

13:22.903 --> 13:24.636
but the real superheroes

13:24.638 --> 13:26.237
are sitting
right in front of me.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.576
Yeah...

13:31.578 --> 13:34.746
His middle name is David. Go.

13:35.781 --> 13:38.650
Look, I care about you a lot,

13:38.652 --> 13:41.419
but we are very
different people.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.454
Are you breaking up with me?

13:44.857 --> 13:46.591
No, no, I'm just
pointing out that

13:46.593 --> 13:49.694
you're dark on the inside
and I'm dark on the outside.

13:51.263 --> 13:54.032
So, anyway,
what I'm trying to say is...

13:54.034 --> 13:55.266
(phone rings)

13:57.303 --> 13:58.469
You need to take that?

13:58.471 --> 13:59.737
It's just my dad,
probably calling

13:59.739 --> 14:01.906
to wish me a happy birthday.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.108
I'll call him back.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.010
You were saying?

14:07.546 --> 14:10.849
Look, Raj, be honest with me.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.717
If you want to end things,
just do it.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.419
Don't expect me
to do it for you.

14:16.322 --> 14:20.124
End things? I'm trying to
tell you that I love you.

14:22.528 --> 14:28.266
BOTH:
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

14:35.975 --> 14:37.942
Wow, there's
a Denny's in Vegas

14:37.944 --> 14:39.444
you can actually
get married in.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.880
(chuckles)
Doesn't sound
very romantic.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.249
Yeah, but we could get
heart-shaped pancakes.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.651
I'm sure we'll find
a decent chapel.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.553
Yeah.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.522
This is crazy!
I know!

14:51.524 --> 14:53.391
You think people
are gonna be mad?

14:53.393 --> 14:56.027
Maybe. But this isn't
about them; it's about us.

14:56.029 --> 14:59.163
It is.
It is about us.

14:59.165 --> 15:00.765
And you know what
the best part is?

15:00.767 --> 15:02.267
We took our time.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.036
I mean, we met, we were friends
for a couple years,

15:05.038 --> 15:08.439
then we got together,
and then we got untogether,

15:08.441 --> 15:10.174
then we worked out
all our problems,

15:10.176 --> 15:12.577
and now we know
everything about each other,

15:12.579 --> 15:16.581
we can just go forward with
no surprises and no regrets.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.650
Right.
No surprises.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.520
And no regrets.

15:27.526 --> 15:28.793
Uh,

15:28.795 --> 15:31.930
well, there-there's
one thing

15:31.932 --> 15:33.998
I feel I should tell you.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.099
What?

15:35.101 --> 15:37.735
You know, so we
can go into this

15:37.737 --> 15:39.971
with no secrets
between us.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.039
What?

15:45.110 --> 15:46.911
Remember, uh,
a couple years back

15:46.913 --> 15:49.881
when I was on that research ship
in the North Sea?

15:49.883 --> 15:51.482
Yeah.
Okay, well,

15:51.484 --> 15:53.818
there-there was a
lot of drinking

15:53.820 --> 15:55.853
and craziness
going on...
No, you told me.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.488
Okay, um...

15:59.325 --> 16:01.793
Well, there was this girl.

16:03.195 --> 16:05.196
What did you do?
Nothing...

16:05.198 --> 16:06.731
really.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.399
It was just kissing.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.368
And then what?
And then nothing.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.904
I stopped it.

16:12.906 --> 16:16.674
But it still bothers me, and...

16:18.677 --> 16:20.411
I wanted you to know.

16:22.281 --> 16:23.881
(sighs)

16:23.883 --> 16:25.950
All right.

16:27.786 --> 16:30.154
Did you ever do anything
like this since we've been...?

16:30.156 --> 16:32.523
Nope, never.
Oh, that's too bad.

16:33.792 --> 16:36.928
You know,
can I ask you a question?
Hmm?

16:36.930 --> 16:38.396
Why are you
telling me this now?

16:38.398 --> 16:41.666
Well, like I said,
we're about to get married,

16:41.668 --> 16:44.235
and I-I want a clean slate.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.503
No secrets.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.871
Really?
Be-Because to me,

16:46.873 --> 16:48.606
it seems like
we're about to get married

16:48.608 --> 16:49.974
and you're trying
to sabotage it.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.310
W-Would you rather
I didn't tell you?

16:52.312 --> 16:55.146
No, I don't want there
to be secrets between us.
See, now I'm confused.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.614
I mean, what-what
am I supposed to do?

16:56.616 --> 16:59.384
Uh, keep your mouth
off other women.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.686
I can do that.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.321
Uh, uh, f-from now on,

17:03.323 --> 17:06.089
this mouth...
You and food, that's it.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.593
(sighs)

17:08.595 --> 17:10.661
Okay.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.630
Yeah?

17:14.733 --> 17:17.135
Look, I'm not happy
this happened,

17:17.137 --> 17:19.002
but I think
I can get past it.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.972
I mean, we weren't
engaged at the time,

17:20.973 --> 17:22.473
and it was just kissing.

17:22.474 --> 17:23.741
Right.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.210
Just kissing.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.246
It wasn't even very good.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.114
She was a smoker.
I'd just been seasick...

17:30.116 --> 17:31.436
Okay, that's enough.
Stop talking.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.856
So...

17:38.858 --> 17:41.759
we're still
getting married?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.327
Yes.

17:45.197 --> 17:46.697
Because we love each other.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.466
Yes.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.736
And it's the happiest day
of our lives.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.004
(short laugh)
Don't push it.

17:59.344 --> 18:02.013
(line ringing)

18:02.015 --> 18:03.147
Hello.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.348
SHELDON:
Hello.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.884
Listen, I've been
thinking a lot

18:06.886 --> 18:08.286
about relationships

18:08.288 --> 18:11.556
and how difficult they can be,
and I think...

18:11.558 --> 18:13.591
I've been thinking
about them, too, Sheldon.

18:15.294 --> 18:18.296
Being your girlfriend
is so challenging.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.697
Emotionally,

18:19.699 --> 18:21.866
physically.

18:21.868 --> 18:25.203
I've been incredibly patient
for years.

18:26.171 --> 18:27.872
Strongly disagree.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.640
Go on.

18:29.642 --> 18:33.044
Okay, well...

18:33.046 --> 18:37.081
this isn't easy to say,
because I love you,

18:37.083 --> 18:38.850
but...

18:38.852 --> 18:42.587
I need some time
to take a step back

18:42.589 --> 18:45.590
and reevaluate our situation.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.860
Oh.

18:48.862 --> 18:51.963
I hope you understand.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.134
Okay.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.570
Bye, Sheldon.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.991
Well, Gollum...

19:21.927 --> 19:25.263
...you're an expert on rings.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.332
What do I do with this one?
