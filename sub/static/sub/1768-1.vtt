the name Moretti.

a man named O'Rooney.

Dellaplane's former partner
was a multimillionaire...

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:04.796
and an all-around deviant
named Enzo Catelli.

01:07:04.996 --> 01:07:09.797
Catelli lived in Rome, and as a defense
against kidnapping attempts...

01:07:10.001 --> 01:07:11.878
formed an elite group
of bodyguards...

01:07:12.086 --> 01:07:14.805
which he called
"The Invisible Men"...

01:07:15.006 --> 01:07:17.179
due to their
almost demonic ability...

- But Catelli's dead, isn't he?
- Alas, he had no defense...

01:07:25.183 --> 01:07:27.481
against his bodyguard's greed.

01:07:27.685 --> 01:07:30.939
Dellaplane financed
Catelli's demise.

the first Mrs. Dellaplane as well.

He might even have deployed
them against you...

made that unnecessary.

01:31:59.906 --> 01:32:01.658
How bad is it?

01:32:01.866 --> 01:32:05.621
Oh. This is one dead
piece-of-shit car builder. Heh.

01:32:08.498 --> 01:32:11.672
I want the paramedics and a meat
wagon down here right away.

01:32:11.876 --> 01:32:14.755
I want a full report on my desk
first thing in the morning.

01:32:14.963 --> 01:32:18.934
- In the morning?
- In the morning, lieutenant.

01:32:20.009 --> 01:32:21.056
Lieutenant?

01:32:21.261 --> 01:32:24.356
- Lieutenant?
- Is there an echo around here?

01:32:26.683 --> 01:32:28.685
You always said you wouldn't team up
with a junkie.

01:32:28.893 --> 01:32:30.236
How about an ex-junkie, huh?

01:32:30.436 --> 01:32:32.029
Wait a minute. You kidding?

01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:36.235
Cold turkey. You can have me
on Thanksgiving. How's that?

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.953
Can I have you any sooner?

01:32:39.154 --> 01:32:41.156
