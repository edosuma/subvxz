[country music playing]

00:13.792 --> 00:16.542
- Hey, Beau.
- What're you doing here, Maggie?

00:16.625 --> 00:19.542
I'm sorry to interrupt, but can we talk?

00:25.208 --> 00:26.667
I have nothing to say to you.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.250
Who's your friend?

00:29.333 --> 00:30.542
None of your business.

00:30.625 --> 00:32.792
Really? We're still married.

00:32.875 --> 00:34.000
Still married?

00:34.083 --> 00:36.125
Is that why you took off
in the middle of the night

00:36.208 --> 00:38.000
and I didn't hear from
you for three weeks?

00:38.083 --> 00:40.667
You don't get to come back
here and start asking questions.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.417
Beau, I just thought
I'd come here and...

00:42.500 --> 00:43.917
Ah, I've got nothing to say to you.

00:47.417 --> 00:49.875
You can't just ignore me.

00:49.958 --> 00:51.708
Oh, yeah? Watch me.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.083
Beau!

00:56.042 --> 00:57.458
[door slams]

01:02.125 --> 01:03.750
So, I'm Joanne.

[on TV] <i>...of our first snowstorm...</i>

02:10.250 --> 02:12.500
Dude. [Chuckles] Check this out!

02:12.583 --> 02:16.375
Oh, shit, that's a big
snowstorm heading our way.

02:16.429 --> 02:17.989
No, I'm talking about the weather girl.

02:19.917 --> 02:21.597
There's a low-pressure
system coming in...

02:21.667 --> 02:23.583
my pants. [Chuckles]

02:25.375 --> 02:26.792
Yeah, that's Tanya Showers.

02:26.875 --> 02:28.417
Saw her at a Chili's once.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.292
I gave her a great line. Walked
up to her, and I was like,

02:31.375 --> 02:35.000
"You got a 100% chance of a Rooster
front moving in on you right now."

02:35.083 --> 02:37.083
[chuckling] What'd she
say? What'd she say?

02:37.158 --> 02:38.798
She was like, "Yeah?
This is my boyfriend,

02:38.875 --> 02:40.792
he's a defenseman for
the Colorado Avalanche."

02:40.875 --> 02:42.083
Oh. [Chuckles]

02:42.163 --> 02:44.184
Words were exchanged, we
agreed to go our separate ways

02:44.208 --> 02:45.708
and I finished my nachos in the car.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.292
Hey, you hear back from Abby?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.625
Nope. She ain't gonna
hear from me either, man.

02:53.333 --> 02:56.375
She don't wanna break up with Kenny,
then that's it, man, it's done and done.

02:56.458 --> 02:59.792
There you go. That's how you break
up with your imaginary girlfriend.

03:02.083 --> 03:05.042
Hey, Dad, you see this
storm? Looks pretty crazy.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.417
Of course I saw it.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.000
You would, too, if you
just looked to the north.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.542
I've been checking cows. What
have you been doing all morning?

03:13.625 --> 03:14.958
All morning?

03:15.042 --> 03:16.802
The sun's only been up
for like five minutes.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.708
I guess all sons are lazy.

03:19.792 --> 03:21.333
[chuckling]

03:21.417 --> 03:22.518
That was a pretty good one there, Dad.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.702
Yeah, you're coming in strong
with that one. [Chuckles]

03:25.708 --> 03:29.125
You wanna see the weather?
Get your asses outside.

03:29.208 --> 03:32.250
Stop looking at the TV and
get out there and do something.

03:32.333 --> 03:33.583
[Colt sighs]

03:37.750 --> 03:39.083
Is that Tanya Showers?

03:40.625 --> 03:43.792
Yep. If I had my way,
she'd be Tanya Bennett.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.917
Yeah, 'cause of me.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.393
Yeah, 'cause I'm sure she's wondering,

03:47.417 --> 03:49.518
"What happened to that guy who
pissed himself in the Chili's?"

03:49.542 --> 03:50.542
[chuckles]

03:52.208 --> 03:54.417
I saw her at AutoZone the other day.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.792
Woman changes her own oil.

03:57.792 --> 03:59.458
Gotta respect that.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.208
[Tanya speaking indistinctly]

04:06.917 --> 04:09.333
Want us to put some
antifreeze in the tractor?

04:09.417 --> 04:12.458
Yeah, and then head into town
and pick up some snow fence.

04:13.875 --> 04:15.042
Ma'am.

[cell phone chimes]

04:20.541 --> 04:21.583
Oh, hey.

04:21.666 --> 04:23.333
Hey.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.125
Got a text. From Mom.

04:25.875 --> 04:28.125
[reading] "Back in town.
Can't wait to see you."

04:29.042 --> 04:30.242
Oh, yeah, I got the same text.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.375
[snickers] She texted me first.

04:32.458 --> 04:34.018
- Guess I'm the favorite son.
- [scoffs]

04:34.750 --> 04:36.851
Dude, I've been the favorite
since before you were born.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.458
Oh, really? If she liked you so
much, why'd she have more kids?

04:39.542 --> 04:43.000
[scoffs] Pretty sure she asks
herself that question every day.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.101
Hey, after work, we'll swing
by the bar and see what's up.

04:46.125 --> 04:48.417
Yeah, it'll be good
to catch up with her.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.601
- I wanna hear where she went. [Sighs]
- Yeah, and what she did.

04:50.625 --> 04:51.750
Plus, now she's back...

04:51.833 --> 04:53.458
[both] Free beer.

04:55.875 --> 04:56.958
Oh! [Groans]

04:57.958 --> 04:59.143
Hey, Dad, you hear Mom's back?

04:59.167 --> 05:01.500
- Yeah, I heard.
- [Colt exhales sharply]

05:01.583 --> 05:03.417
Really? When?

05:03.500 --> 05:05.750
When she stopped by here last night.

05:06.917 --> 05:09.458
Wait. She stopped by? What'd she say?

05:09.542 --> 05:11.958
She said we needed to talk.

05:12.083 --> 05:13.542
I disagreed.

05:14.917 --> 05:17.667
Dad, if you ignore her, she
ain't just gonna go away.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.708
You prove that point every day.

05:26.417 --> 05:27.792
- Hey, Mom.
- Momma!

05:27.875 --> 05:28.917
Hey, boys!

05:29.000 --> 05:30.500
[Rooster chuckles] All right!

05:30.583 --> 05:32.417
First hug, favorite son.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.792
Oh, I don't love you more,
Jameson, you know that.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.458
Oh, hear that? That
means she loves me more.

05:37.542 --> 05:39.625
- No, it doesn't.
- [chuckles]

05:39.708 --> 05:42.375
- [Maggie laughs]
- Guess that leaves me.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.000
Nice try, Hank.

05:45.083 --> 05:48.917
Well, I suppose that's what
I get for opening my heart.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.042
[all chuckle]

05:50.125 --> 05:51.458
Man, it is good to see you, Mom.

05:51.542 --> 05:52.792
Yeah, we missed you.

05:52.875 --> 05:54.000
You boys want a beer?

05:54.125 --> 05:56.542
Oh, you guys sell beer here?
Yeah, sure, I'll take one.

05:57.542 --> 05:59.042
- Thanks, Mom.
- Yeah.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.292
That'll be six bucks.

06:01.375 --> 06:02.625
You kidding?

06:03.667 --> 06:06.083
You're gonna charge
us? That's child abuse.

06:07.083 --> 06:10.292
Maria said, since I left,
you've been paying. I like it.

06:10.375 --> 06:12.292
[both] Damn it, Maria!

06:14.583 --> 06:15.583
All right, you know what?

06:15.667 --> 06:17.833
We gotta pay, we gotta pay.

06:17.917 --> 06:19.625
Hey, Momma, can I borrow six bucks?

06:21.333 --> 06:22.542
I missed you boys.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.559
Missed you too. Hey, I know
it's none of my business,

06:24.583 --> 06:26.063
but what's going on with you and Dad?

06:26.708 --> 06:28.708
Oh, it's complicated.

06:28.792 --> 06:30.393
That's what people say when
they don't wanna tell you.

06:30.417 --> 06:32.542
Good, you get it.

06:33.167 --> 06:35.018
Look, Mom, we were just
worried about you. That's all.

06:35.042 --> 06:36.750
Well, I appreciate that.

06:36.833 --> 06:39.458
Didn't think I needed to leave a
babysitter for my grown-ass sons

06:39.542 --> 06:41.042
while I was getting my shit together.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.083
Okay, I know she's joking,

06:43.167 --> 06:45.500
but how cool would it be to
have a babysitter? [Chuckles]

06:47.917 --> 06:50.417
So, did your dad say
anything about me being back?

06:50.500 --> 06:52.583
Yeah. "It's complicated."

06:55.083 --> 06:57.500
Oh. Hey, Heather. How...

07:00.042 --> 07:01.750
I'm gonna go talk to her.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.125
Man, if getting the middle
finger means "come talk to me,"

07:04.208 --> 07:07.208
I have missed out on a lot of
opportunities talking to ladies.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.458
All right, so what's the deal
between your dad and this Joanne?

07:12.542 --> 07:15.417
Look, snitches get stitches.

07:16.375 --> 07:18.500
You want info, it's gonna cost you.

07:18.583 --> 07:20.208
Cheeseburger, medium-rare,

07:20.292 --> 07:22.000
hold the onions, hold the bill.

07:23.833 --> 07:25.250
Deal.

07:25.333 --> 07:26.750
So, Joanne?

07:26.833 --> 07:28.167
No idea.

07:29.458 --> 07:31.792
Side of cheddar fries, please.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.667
Colt's my favorite.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.583
- Hey.
- Hey, Colt.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.500
Oh, I saw someone keyed
your truck. Tough break.

07:44.417 --> 07:45.708
We didn't drive here.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.000
Wait, really?

07:49.458 --> 07:51.375
- Yeah.
- Shit.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.375
[sighs] So, what do you want?

07:56.583 --> 07:57.667
I'm really sorry.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.333
Okay. Thanks.

08:00.417 --> 08:01.667
Bye.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.292
I was an idiot.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.083
Colt, that's not true.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.458
An idiot has no idea what he's doing.

08:07.542 --> 08:09.375
You're an asshole,
dickhead, piece of shit.

08:11.833 --> 08:13.292
Okay, that's... No...

08:14.250 --> 08:15.750
Yeah, all right.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.250
God, you wanna know what sucks, Colt?

08:18.333 --> 08:20.476
Is we were having a ton of fun
together and now we can't do that.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.708
I know, I know. And
it's my fault. [Stammers]

08:23.875 --> 08:24.917
You were right.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.042
I was hung up on a girl from 15 years
ago, who's engaged to another guy.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.542
And I know you probably hate me but...

08:31.458 --> 08:35.332
I just... I want you to know
that I know I'm pathetic.

08:37.042 --> 08:40.000
To be fair, you aren't the
only one who was pathetic.

08:41.207 --> 08:42.207
I was hung up on a guy

08:42.292 --> 08:44.393
who was still hung up on his
high school girlfriend. [Scoffs]

08:44.417 --> 08:45.417
[chuckles]

08:45.500 --> 08:47.540
Guess that makes you the
real loser, huh? [Chuckles]

08:48.500 --> 08:51.000
I just... wanted to say I'm sorry.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.958
Okay. So. I'll go. [Clears throat]

08:58.542 --> 09:00.708
Colt, hold on.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.708
Look, your brother's dating my mom.

09:04.792 --> 09:06.708
We both go to the only bar in town.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.792
At least we can...

09:09.750 --> 09:10.917
Be friends?

09:11.625 --> 09:12.625
Yeah.

09:14.125 --> 09:15.625
You want a beer?

09:17.667 --> 09:21.458
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'll just get a couple.

09:23.375 --> 09:24.375
All right,

09:24.458 --> 09:27.542
who keyed "Fuck Colt" on my truck?

09:36.417 --> 09:37.500
Hey.

09:38.625 --> 09:40.583
What you doing out here? It's freezing.

09:41.375 --> 09:42.500
Well, not that you'd know,

09:42.583 --> 09:45.667
but when you work hard,
sometimes you get hot. [Scoffs]

09:47.625 --> 09:50.042
I don't need to work
hard, I'm naturally hot.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.167
Where's your brother?

09:53.250 --> 09:54.458
I'll give you two guesses.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.500
- The bar.
- Correct.

09:58.292 --> 10:00.042
Did you get some more snow fence today?

10:00.125 --> 10:02.917
No, I did not, 'cause
everybody is sold out.

10:04.750 --> 10:07.167
You need to man up... figure
this thing out with Mom.

10:07.917 --> 10:09.333
What did you just say to me?

10:09.417 --> 10:13.083
I said that, uh, earlier, Colt
said you needed to man up...

10:16.208 --> 10:18.448
and, uh, figure it out with
Mom 'cause she wants to talk.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.125
That's great.

10:20.208 --> 10:24.125
I wish Tanya Showers was sitting
across from me instead of you.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.833
I guess we're both shit out of luck.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.307
You're just gonna
never talk to Mom again?

10:31.167 --> 10:34.417
What goes on between your mother
and I is none of your business.

10:35.792 --> 10:37.083
Yeah, it is my business.

10:37.833 --> 10:39.750
'Cause you're my dad, she's my mom.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.250
When she left, you asked me,

10:42.333 --> 10:45.125
"Why'd she go?" "What did I do wrong?"

10:45.208 --> 10:48.125
Now she's finally back and you
won't even bother to find out?

10:49.083 --> 10:50.417
That's fucked up, Dad.

10:51.042 --> 10:52.250
Go talk to her.

11:00.958 --> 11:02.750
- [Colt grunts]
- [both chuckling]

11:03.833 --> 11:05.292
- Well...
- [grunts]

11:05.375 --> 11:08.250
- Okay. [Laughs]
- Oh.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.708
That just happened.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.309
I'm guessing that ain't
what you had in mind

11:11.333 --> 11:13.792
when you keyed "Fuck
Colt" on to Hank's truck.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.333
[both chuckle]

11:15.417 --> 11:17.625
Yeah, this was probably a mistake.

11:17.708 --> 11:18.750
[Colt chuckles]

11:18.833 --> 11:21.125
I promised myself I'd
never touch you again.

11:21.208 --> 11:23.288
Yeah, I promised myself
that all through high school.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.500
Never worked.

11:24.583 --> 11:25.917
[chuckles]

11:29.458 --> 11:30.792
Hey, I...

11:30.875 --> 11:32.792
I didn't think that
we were gonna hook up.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.667
I really did just wanna apologize.

11:36.750 --> 11:37.750
[Heather chuckles]

11:37.833 --> 11:40.250
I mean, if I had my life
to live all over again,

11:40.333 --> 11:41.973
I'd definitely do
this. But... [chuckles]

11:43.083 --> 11:45.083
You know, it would last longer.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.250
Do you regret this?

11:52.917 --> 11:54.583
I don't know.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.208
Right now?

11:56.292 --> 11:57.792
No. [Laughs]

11:57.875 --> 11:58.958
[chuckles]

11:59.042 --> 12:01.042
Later, when my mom asks me where I was?

12:01.125 --> 12:02.167
Probably.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.542
Oh, yeah, your mom. [Sighs]

12:04.625 --> 12:06.583
[gulps] She scares me.

12:08.083 --> 12:09.667
Please don't tell her.

12:11.792 --> 12:14.583
- You wanna do it again?
- [chuckles] Seriously?

12:14.667 --> 12:17.833
Well, yeah. If we wait too long,
it becomes two separate mistakes,

12:17.917 --> 12:20.250
but... if we do it now,
it's the same mistake.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.000
- Yeah, that works for me.
- [laughs]

12:29.917 --> 12:32.417
Oh, look who's here.

12:33.417 --> 12:36.875
Would you like a drink or
should I just go fuck myself?

12:38.917 --> 12:40.875
Let's hear what you've got to say.

12:40.958 --> 12:42.208
Hmm.

12:42.292 --> 12:44.792
Not much for small talk, are you?

12:44.875 --> 12:45.958
Okay.

12:46.917 --> 12:49.667
How about that snowstorm coming in?

12:49.750 --> 12:51.500
Read any good books lately?

12:52.625 --> 12:54.875
Why in the fuck did you take off?

12:55.875 --> 12:56.917
[cork squeaks]

12:57.000 --> 12:59.167
I probably should keep this handy.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.708
I shouldn't have left like that.

13:02.792 --> 13:04.625
I panicked 'cause I thought

13:04.708 --> 13:07.125
moving in with you might
be a horrible mistake.

13:07.958 --> 13:10.208
So far, great apology.

13:11.833 --> 13:15.458
I didn't know how to tell you. So I ran.

13:15.542 --> 13:18.708
I'm not saying it's fair or
rational, but that's what I did.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.750
I just started driving.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.875
Next thing I know, I'm
ordering two beef and cheddars

13:23.958 --> 13:26.583
and a Jamocha shake at Arby's in Utah.

13:27.750 --> 13:30.458
I skipped the part where I
smoked a joint in the parking lot.

13:32.458 --> 13:33.750
You know what I did?

13:34.667 --> 13:36.125
Sat on the porch all night

13:36.208 --> 13:38.375
wondering how after
40 years of marriage,

13:38.458 --> 13:41.583
the only thing you can do
is leave me a fucking note.

13:43.125 --> 13:46.167
I skipped the part where I
burned all your shit in a barrel.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.458
I knew you'd be upset.

13:49.542 --> 13:51.667
But I had to get away from you...

13:51.750 --> 13:55.542
and that ranch and this
bar and everything else.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.250
I needed to go someplace

13:57.333 --> 14:00.625
where I could figure out what
I wanted to do with my life.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.833
And that place was Arby's?

14:05.417 --> 14:07.542
I finally get to Big Sur.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.583
And it's really beautiful there.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.792
So I built this campfire 'cause
I couldn't find my winter jacket.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.583
Burned it in the barrel.

14:17.417 --> 14:19.667
Okay. So...

14:19.750 --> 14:23.208
I'm sitting there enjoying
this beautiful sunset

14:23.292 --> 14:24.958
and everything is perfect...

14:25.875 --> 14:27.250
except for one thing.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.250
You weren't there to watch it with me.

14:33.375 --> 14:34.708
What's your point, Maggie?

14:34.792 --> 14:37.500
My point is I want you in my life,

14:37.583 --> 14:40.625
but I don't wanna spend
my whole life in this town.

14:40.708 --> 14:43.208
- So come with me.
- What?

14:43.292 --> 14:45.542
[sighs] I've been thinking about it.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.667
We can have the best of both worlds.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.542
We travel for a month, we
come back here for a month.

14:51.375 --> 14:53.625
Don't you wanna hike in the Grand Canyon

14:53.708 --> 14:57.750
or see Niagara Falls or have
some great coffee in Portland?

14:59.250 --> 15:02.125
You're trying to sell
me on this with Portland?

15:02.208 --> 15:04.333
All right. Mount Rushmore, then.

15:04.417 --> 15:07.708
I'll go to Mount Rushmore when
they put Ronald Reagan on it.

15:08.917 --> 15:11.333
I mean, what's the point
of working for 50 years

15:11.417 --> 15:13.125
if you never take any time off?

15:13.208 --> 15:15.167
What are we doing here, Maggie?

15:16.333 --> 15:19.833
I'm not asking for just
me. I'm asking for you.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.667
You need this. We need this.

15:25.583 --> 15:28.500
So won't you please just think about it?

15:30.375 --> 15:33.500
I'm not sure there is anything
you can say to change my mind.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.333
You won't have to put up
with Colt and Rooster anymore.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.250
- I'm listening.
- [laughs]

15:45.042 --> 15:46.292
[Colt] Hey.

15:46.375 --> 15:48.292
- Can I ask your opinion on something?
- No.

15:48.375 --> 15:50.000
Stop, okay?

15:50.083 --> 15:52.476
If this has anything to do with
you leaving the bar with Heather,

15:52.500 --> 15:53.601
I don't wanna hear about it.

15:53.625 --> 15:56.042
'Cause as of right now, my
girlfriend calls me and says,

15:56.125 --> 15:57.726
"Did my daughter sleep
with that asshole again?"

15:57.750 --> 15:59.708
I can say, "Honestly, I got no idea."

16:00.708 --> 16:02.125
Yeah, that's smart.

16:02.208 --> 16:04.476
You can't get in trouble if you
don't know Heather and I hooked up.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.500
[Rooster] Mmm-hmm.

16:06.417 --> 16:07.417
Twice.

16:08.292 --> 16:10.958
Damn it, Colt! Oh,
man, I got brain freeze.

16:11.042 --> 16:13.042
Dude, your dick is ruining my life.

16:13.125 --> 16:16.042
[chuckles] Well, I didn't
plan on it. It just happened.

16:16.125 --> 16:18.042
Oh, yeah? You plan on Abby coming by?

16:18.125 --> 16:19.708
- Plan on what?
- [knocking on door]

16:23.667 --> 16:25.184
[whispers] Shit, what is she doing here?

16:25.208 --> 16:27.417
She probably came over
to hang out with Heather.

16:29.667 --> 16:30.708
Hey, guys.

16:30.792 --> 16:31.792
- Hey.
- [Rooster] Hey.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.667
Abby. This is, uh...

16:34.583 --> 16:35.625
What you doing?

16:35.708 --> 16:37.375
I am so glad to see you right now.

16:38.167 --> 16:39.167
Can we talk?

16:39.250 --> 16:41.333
Yeah. [Stutters] Let's go outside.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.267
- [Rooster] Good luck.
- [mouthing] Fuck!

16:45.792 --> 16:46.833
- Oh!
- All right.

16:46.917 --> 16:50.250
[stammering] So, let's just,
uh, talk over here in this...

16:50.333 --> 16:52.184
- Okay.
- Yeah, well, I'll just stand right here.

16:52.208 --> 16:54.458
- How about that?
- All right. [Chuckles nervously]

16:54.542 --> 16:55.708
Uh, what's going on?

16:57.292 --> 16:58.333
I did it.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.333
[chuckles nervously] You did what?

17:02.042 --> 17:03.708
I broke up with Kenny tonight.

17:05.416 --> 17:06.875
Oh, shit.

17:08.125 --> 17:09.458
Are you serious?

17:10.500 --> 17:13.208
I didn't think this was gonna happen.

17:13.291 --> 17:16.375
No, I know, I know, I'm sorry. I just...

17:16.458 --> 17:17.916
I was waiting for the right time.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.500
Kenny was on the phone tonight

17:19.583 --> 17:22.000
and he was doing this
thing that he always does,

17:22.083 --> 17:24.000
flicking his Von Miller bobblehead.

17:24.083 --> 17:27.291
He just kept flicking it and
flicking it and flicking it.

17:27.375 --> 17:28.667
All I could think of was...

17:29.583 --> 17:31.875
"Do I really wanna spend the
rest of my life with him?"

17:32.583 --> 17:34.917
I looked over at Von
Miller and he was like...

17:37.333 --> 17:38.375
Kenny hung up the phone,

17:38.458 --> 17:41.958
and I just blurted out, "I
wanna break up with you."

17:42.042 --> 17:44.750
And then he said, "That
was my mom, she says hi."

17:45.667 --> 17:46.875
[chuckles] Damn.

17:46.958 --> 17:50.250
I know. I... I felt terrible. I just...

17:50.333 --> 17:52.583
I can't believe how great this is.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.250
- [chuckles]
- [stutters]

17:54.333 --> 17:57.208
Oh, you should go home and update
your relationship status on Facebook.

17:58.625 --> 18:01.458
Go home? What do you mean?
I thought you would be happy.

18:01.542 --> 18:04.458
Oh, I am. [Stammering] Oh, I'm thrilled.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.583
It's just... I mean,

18:05.667 --> 18:08.125
but it's so much excitement,
so late at night, I'm...

18:08.208 --> 18:09.583
Ooh, I'm tired.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.083
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

18:11.167 --> 18:13.792
I've never been better. You ought
to go, though. But, like, now.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.667
- [chuckles]
- Colt?

18:17.750 --> 18:19.667
- Heather.
- Abby.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.875
[both] You gotta be fucking kidding me.

18:21.958 --> 18:24.167
No. No, no, no, I can
explain everything.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.917
I didn't know this was gonna happen.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.458
- [sighs] You're an asshole.
- Heather...

18:33.000 --> 18:34.184
[softly] Abby, I honestly, I didn't...

18:34.208 --> 18:35.667
Fuck you, Colt.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.917
- Abby. Abby.
- [car engine starts]

18:39.667 --> 18:40.792
Abby.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.625
All right, that's the rest
of the salt. Can I go now?

18:50.708 --> 18:54.375
Where you going in such a hurry?
You know there's a storm coming in.

18:54.458 --> 18:56.042
Look, Abby was stringing me along,

18:56.125 --> 18:57.893
so I hooked up with Heather
and then Abby found out

18:57.917 --> 19:00.309
and now she won't return my
texts, so I need to go talk to her.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.417
I didn't say I cared.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.042
I'm not going anywhere, Daddy.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.000
I don't leave till all the work is done.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.833
Are you just saying that 'cause
you know all the work's done?

19:11.917 --> 19:13.792
- It is?
- [vehicle approaching]

19:13.875 --> 19:16.583
Well, then I suppose I'll call it a day.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.458
- [vehicle door slams]
- Hello, Joanne.

19:19.542 --> 19:21.542
Hey, Beau. Hey, Rooster.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.958
- Hello, Joanne.
- Good to see you.

19:24.667 --> 19:27.417
Or did your Chevy just
break down passing by?

19:28.417 --> 19:29.750
That's cute.

19:29.833 --> 19:31.542
No, I had some snow fence in storage,

19:31.625 --> 19:33.500
so I thought maybe you all could use it.

19:33.583 --> 19:35.583
That's very nice of you.

19:35.667 --> 19:38.042
Rooster was just looking
for some more work to do.

19:38.125 --> 19:40.875
Why don't you go unload that
and move it into the barn?

19:41.542 --> 19:43.833
You kidding? I got a beer
inside with my name on it.

19:44.958 --> 19:46.268
I literally have to
put my name on the beer.

19:46.292 --> 19:47.812
Otherwise, Colt's gonna drink 'em all.

19:48.792 --> 19:51.167
In my house, a young
man wouldn't talk back

19:51.250 --> 19:53.208
when his father asked
him to do something.

19:55.042 --> 19:56.375
I like her.

19:58.042 --> 20:00.042
Remember, earlier, when
we were making fun of Colt?

20:00.250 --> 20:02.208
That's what this family's about, okay?

20:02.292 --> 20:04.042
Don't you let her divide us.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.083
[sighs]

20:10.000 --> 20:11.625
I'm sorry about the other night.

20:11.708 --> 20:13.708
Oh, you mean when you stormed off

20:13.792 --> 20:15.458
and I had to introduce myself to a lady

20:15.542 --> 20:17.917
who thought I was trying
to steal her husband?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.708
Yeah, that wasn't awkward at all.

20:21.750 --> 20:22.792
So, uh, how'd it go?

20:22.875 --> 20:24.583
You... you two getting back together?

20:26.208 --> 20:28.458
Thanks for the snow fence, Joanne.

20:28.542 --> 20:30.083
I'm sorry you can't stay.

20:30.167 --> 20:32.833
[sighs] I got nowhere else to be.

20:32.917 --> 20:36.875
Quickest way back to town?
Take the 145 to the 62 north.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.750
You know, you can
keep it all bottled up,

20:39.833 --> 20:42.518
but your friends are just gonna ask
you if you're okay with her leaving

20:42.542 --> 20:43.875
and you're gonna say, "I'm fine."

20:43.958 --> 20:45.542
And then they're gonna keep checking in

20:45.625 --> 20:47.268
and you're gonna say,
"Oh, nothing's wrong."

20:47.292 --> 20:48.684
And then one day,
you'll be at the Safeway

20:48.708 --> 20:51.125
buying a frozen pizza
and some Crystal Light,

20:51.208 --> 20:53.048
you go out and a little
Girl Scout's gonna say,

20:53.125 --> 20:54.559
"Wanna buy some cookies?"
and you're gonna say,

20:54.583 --> 20:56.833
"Mind your own business,
you nosey little bitch!"

20:59.625 --> 21:00.958
[chuckles] So...

21:01.875 --> 21:04.792
I'm gonna ask you again,
Beau... how'd it go?

21:04.875 --> 21:08.333
Mind your own business.
You know the rest.

21:12.417 --> 21:14.167
She wants to get back together...

21:14.833 --> 21:16.125
and travel.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.417
When was the last time you traveled?

21:18.500 --> 21:20.167
Vietnam.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.875
She wants me to leave the ranch...

21:23.958 --> 21:26.125
and go to places like Portland.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.042
Portland?

21:28.125 --> 21:31.958
That's just a city full of people
who couldn't make it in Seattle.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.542
She says we're only
gonna travel part-time...

21:36.167 --> 21:38.292
but I get the sense
if it was up to her...

21:38.875 --> 21:40.500
we'd never come back here again.

21:40.583 --> 21:43.292
Well, say that was the case.

21:43.375 --> 21:46.000
I mean, it's either her or the ranch.

21:46.083 --> 21:47.958
Which one would be
harder to live without?

21:49.000 --> 21:52.708
I've lived without her
before. Wasn't very good.

21:54.042 --> 21:55.542
Never lived without the ranch.

21:56.125 --> 21:57.333
From where I'm sitting...

21:58.292 --> 21:59.375
one thing's for sure.

21:59.458 --> 22:02.625
Between her and the ranch, there's
only one thing that loves you back.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.417
That's true.

22:05.333 --> 22:08.417
Of course, the ranch never
called me a stubborn, old jackass.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.125
Maybe it'd be great.

22:12.792 --> 22:15.833
Just sitting on a beach,
sipping on a Mai Tai.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.708
Okay, you really don't know Portland.

22:29.417 --> 22:30.750
[doorbell rings]

22:39.125 --> 22:40.500
What do you want?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.083
I'm really sorry.

22:45.167 --> 22:47.750
Are you sorry that I saw her?

22:47.833 --> 22:49.417
Or that you slept with her?

22:51.458 --> 22:52.458
Yes.

22:54.875 --> 22:56.375
- We were broken up.
- [scoffs]

22:56.458 --> 22:57.893
I mean... [stutters] we
weren't even broken up,

22:57.917 --> 22:59.000
we were never together.

23:00.458 --> 23:02.417
I didn't think this was gonna happen.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.833
- How could you not know?
- How could I not know?

23:04.917 --> 23:06.643
I asked you if you were
gonna break up with Kenny

23:06.667 --> 23:07.708
and you said, "fuck you."

23:07.792 --> 23:09.917
That's not how the conversation
went and you know it.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.417
Oh, okay, well, I didn't cheat
on you, 'cause technically...

23:12.500 --> 23:14.958
I don't give a shit about "technically."

23:15.042 --> 23:17.583
[voice breaking] All I care
about is how this feels.

23:20.208 --> 23:23.000
[sniffles] I told you that I
was gonna break up with Kenny.

23:23.083 --> 23:25.125
I was ending a five-year
relationship with a guy

23:25.208 --> 23:27.309
that I thought I was gonna
spend the rest of my life with.

23:27.333 --> 23:30.333
And you couldn't trust me or
be patient just a little while?

23:30.417 --> 23:32.042
What's wrong with you?

23:36.542 --> 23:38.792
All I can say is that I'm really sorry.

23:40.917 --> 23:42.833
I didn't think that you wanted me.

23:42.917 --> 23:44.333
Well, I did.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.851
Then you just fucked it
up like you always do.

23:48.875 --> 23:50.083
I know, I fucked it up.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.417
I fuck up everything.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.476
Just like how I fucked up
things with you the first time,

23:53.500 --> 23:56.750
and I fucked up my relationship with
my dad, and school, and football.

23:56.833 --> 23:59.625
That's what I do. I fuck things up.

23:59.708 --> 24:01.851
It's probably easier to count
the things I ain't fucked up.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.809
Hang on, you don't get to
sleep with your ex-girlfriend

24:03.833 --> 24:06.625
and then come over here and feel
sorry for yourself. [Inhales sharply]

24:07.625 --> 24:08.833
Why do you keep doing this?

24:08.917 --> 24:10.167
I don't know! I...

24:10.250 --> 24:13.583
Maybe it's easier to fuck
things up than to try and fail?

24:13.667 --> 24:16.375
'Cause then everyone just
knows you ain't good enough.

24:16.458 --> 24:19.708
[sighs] So you're scared.
I mean, I'm scared, too.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.393
But I can't be with
someone who's gonna run away

24:22.417 --> 24:24.518
- every time things get hard.
- I don't wanna run from you.

24:24.542 --> 24:26.958
You're the only one I wanna
be with. You always have been.

24:27.042 --> 24:30.083
Why do you think, after 15 years,
it's like nothing ever changed?

24:30.167 --> 24:32.292
You're the only reason
I'm still in Garrison.

24:32.347 --> 24:34.391
I would've left after two
days if it wasn't for you.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.958
Just please, please,

24:37.042 --> 24:38.708
just give me another chance.

24:38.792 --> 24:40.083
[sobs]

24:40.125 --> 24:42.583
I don't know, Colt, I don't know.

24:42.667 --> 24:43.833
Maybe we're cursed.

24:43.917 --> 24:44.958
[Colt sighs]

24:45.042 --> 24:46.500
I... The first time we met,

24:46.583 --> 24:49.542
you broke my nose in fourth
grade dodgeball. Remember?

24:49.625 --> 24:51.458
[mumbling] How could I forget?

24:51.542 --> 24:52.726
The ball bounced off your face

24:52.750 --> 24:55.125
and then Dennis Harvey
caught it and I was out.

24:57.917 --> 25:01.292
Look, I promise I
will not screw this up.

25:03.250 --> 25:04.583
That's easy to say.

25:07.458 --> 25:08.833
I'll prove it.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.042
I hope you do.

25:19.792 --> 25:21.125
[sniffs]

25:24.250 --> 25:26.417
[country music playing on radio]

25:26.500 --> 25:28.375
Well, this is a change.

25:28.458 --> 25:31.750
I'm finishing working and you're
sitting on the porch drinking.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.625
Now I get why this bothers you.

25:35.625 --> 25:38.667
- Now I get why you enjoy it.
- [chuckles]

25:40.458 --> 25:42.958
Well, I got all that fence in the barn.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.000
In the barn?

25:45.083 --> 25:46.542
Thought you were gonna put it up.

25:47.625 --> 25:50.583
What? I thought we were
doing that tomorrow.

25:50.667 --> 25:52.208
[groans] All right, I'll do it now.

25:52.292 --> 25:53.958
[chuckles]

25:54.042 --> 25:56.417
Oh, you're messing with me, huh?

25:56.500 --> 25:59.167
Get why you enjoy that, too.

26:00.875 --> 26:02.333
[vehicle approaching]

26:08.292 --> 26:09.417
Hey, Mom.

26:10.417 --> 26:11.875
- Hey.
- Want a whiskey?

26:12.458 --> 26:14.833
- Sure.
- All right. That'll be five bucks.

26:16.833 --> 26:20.083
Jameson, I gave birth to you
on the floor of a fire station

26:20.167 --> 26:22.958
with no painkillers whatsoever.

26:23.042 --> 26:25.292
Fine. $4.

26:29.167 --> 26:31.125
Well, it's nice to see you both.

26:31.208 --> 26:32.309
Mom, Dad was actually just saying

26:32.333 --> 26:34.093
he can't wait to share
his feelings with you.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.292
Payback's a bitch, old man.

26:43.083 --> 26:46.208
You got a dent in
your left-front fender.

26:46.292 --> 26:47.292
Yeah.

26:48.542 --> 26:50.292
You know how in the California Redwoods

26:50.375 --> 26:52.917
they have that tree that
you can drive through?

26:53.000 --> 26:54.458
You get a little too close?

26:54.542 --> 26:57.750
No, I got through it just fine.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.625
Hit a Prius on the other side.

26:59.708 --> 27:02.792
[chuckling] Well worth the dent.

27:10.750 --> 27:13.042
I was so mad at you.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.833
More angry than I can remember being.

27:18.875 --> 27:21.667
I wanted to walk into that
bar, and look you in the eye...

27:22.333 --> 27:24.042
and tell you to go straight to hell.

27:25.125 --> 27:27.875
Well, I suppose I may
have had that coming.

27:28.542 --> 27:30.333
But the second I saw you...

27:31.875 --> 27:34.208
I remembered 40 years ago...

27:35.625 --> 27:39.042
when I fell for the
prettiest girl I'd ever seen.

27:40.583 --> 27:44.500
Forty years? That can't be right.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.167
I'm only 39.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.250
[chuckles]

28:00.000 --> 28:02.250
I can't change who I am, Maggie.

28:04.792 --> 28:07.583
You've found all this stuff
you're passionate about

28:07.667 --> 28:09.167
and that's great.

28:11.208 --> 28:14.875
But the truth is... I'm happy here.

28:15.917 --> 28:17.583
But don't you see, Beau?

28:17.667 --> 28:19.958
I'm passionate about us, too.

28:21.250 --> 28:25.167
I'm just trying to find a compromise.

28:25.250 --> 28:27.792
Can't you meet me halfway?

28:29.375 --> 28:31.167
I could say yes to that.

28:31.250 --> 28:33.167
And a big part of me wants to.

28:35.042 --> 28:37.542
But we both know, after a
couple of days on the road,

28:37.625 --> 28:40.750
all I'd be thinking about
is what's going on back here.

28:43.375 --> 28:45.042
That's not fair to you...

28:45.667 --> 28:46.917
or to me.

28:48.417 --> 28:49.792
No, it's not.

28:52.458 --> 28:54.292
[scoffs] You know...

28:54.958 --> 28:57.958
I can't remember a time
when we had a conversation

28:58.042 --> 29:00.500
that wasn't about
trying to make this work.

29:05.375 --> 29:08.000
You think it's time that
we stopped this dance?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.833
Yes, I think it is.

29:23.292 --> 29:24.667
I want you to know...

29:26.042 --> 29:28.792
I wouldn't change a
thing about our marriage.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.417
Neither would I.

29:37.208 --> 29:40.542
You always did say how much
you enjoyed the first snowfall.

29:41.292 --> 29:42.583
Yeah, and you always did say

29:42.667 --> 29:45.667
what a pain in the ass
it would be, come morning.

29:52.542 --> 29:54.250
I love you, Beau.

29:55.542 --> 29:57.458
I love you, too, Mags.
