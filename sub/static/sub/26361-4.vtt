21:52.659 --> 21:54.574
What if...

21:54.617 --> 21:56.402
What if they traded rapes?

21:56.445 --> 22:01.102
What if Riley raped Anne
as a favor to his incel buddy

22:01.145 --> 22:04.018
who in turn raped Beth

22:04.061 --> 22:06.934
to get revenge for him?

22:06.977 --> 22:09.023
- Wow.

22:09.066 --> 22:11.417
- Look, Peter,
just hear me out.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.680
They were all snubbed by women.

22:13.723 --> 22:16.378
They all wanted revenge.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.120
So one buddy gets it
for the next.

22:19.163 --> 22:22.428
None of these guys had
any particular connection

22:22.471 --> 22:24.125
to their victim.

22:24.168 --> 22:25.735
So they all alibi'd out.

22:25.779 --> 22:27.955
- I take it you didn't get
anything from Riley?

22:27.998 --> 22:29.652
- No, we had to let him go.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.611
- But if I could get a warrant
for his computer,

22:31.654 --> 22:33.221
then I could find out
a little more

22:33.264 --> 22:34.396
about his two friends and,

22:34.440 --> 22:38.226
I hate to say it, rapist #4.

22:40.271 --> 22:43.449
I'll just have to find a judge
who saw "Strangers on a Train."

22:43.492 --> 22:46.321
- Thank you.

22:48.671 --> 22:50.499
- Phalluspower.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.240
- I wouldn't say that
too loud, bro.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.720
- It's Riley's incel handle.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.504
- There's a lot of messages

22:55.548 --> 22:57.332
leading up to the date
of the first rape.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.552
All to somebody who calls
himself Hateful-One.

23:01.510 --> 23:02.729
- One way to find out.

23:04.687 --> 23:05.993
- I told you.
I didn't rape that girl.

23:06.036 --> 23:07.386
- I believe you, Riley.

23:07.429 --> 23:10.563
I do, because, uh,
you raped this one.

23:13.653 --> 23:15.002

23:15.045 --> 23:17.091
- Mm.
But your friend does.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.442

on your private little

23:20.486 --> 23:23.227

23:23.271 --> 23:25.012
Yeah, a lot of nooks and
crannies on the Dark Web.

23:25.055 --> 23:28.450
Took us awhile, Riley,

23:30.147 --> 23:33.063
Oh, did I, uh, did I mention
that I love your handle?

23:33.107 --> 23:35.109
Phalluspower?
That's very clever.

23:35.152 --> 23:38.634
Anyway, you've been writing
to Hateful-One quite a bit.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.549

You wrote that on the day
that Anne Whitman was raped.
