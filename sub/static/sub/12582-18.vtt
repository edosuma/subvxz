<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:37.020 --> 00:38.282
Son, look.

00:38.321 --> 00:39.788
There's Big Tex.

00:39.823 --> 00:43.250
He's like the Grand Canyon
and the Statue of Liberty,

00:43.293 --> 00:44.385
rolled into one.

00:44.427 --> 00:45.394
He seems tough.

00:45.428 --> 00:47.225
But kind.

00:47.263 --> 00:51.199
Yep. He always tells us
what to do and see and eat.

00:51.234 --> 00:54.533
I've gotten better advice from
him than from my own father.

00:54.571 --> 00:56.402
Howdy, folks!

00:57.674 --> 00:59.574
Howdy, howdy.

00:59.609 --> 01:01.133
Check, check, uh, one.

01:01.177 --> 01:03.145
Howdy.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.177
Wow. I'm finally entering
the Grill-Off.

01:07.217 --> 01:09.378
It's just like in my dreams,

01:09.419 --> 01:13.048
except in the dream,
I'm wearing Tom Landry's hat.

01:13.089 --> 01:14.579
Excuse me, sir.

01:14.624 --> 01:17.092
You have two different boxes
for charcoal...

01:17.127 --> 01:18.116
mesquite and hickory...

01:18.161 --> 01:19.753
but I don't see
a box on the entry

01:19.796 --> 01:21.787
for grilling with propane.

01:21.831 --> 01:23.958
'Cause you can't use gas
at a grill-off!

01:24.000 --> 01:26.366
Charcoal only;
your choice of sauce.

01:26.402 --> 01:28.700
Starting this year,
bacon counts as a sauce.

01:28.738 --> 01:30.899
Sir, I choose to enter
this contest

01:30.940 --> 01:32.430
grilling with propane.

01:32.475 --> 01:34.875
It's not a sales ploy,
it's what I prefer.

01:34.911 --> 01:37.675
Well, this is a charcoal
competition, always has been.

01:37.714 --> 01:40.615
Why don't you take your gas
and go fill up your balloons

01:40.650 --> 01:41.639
or whatever you do with it,

01:41.684 --> 01:43.117
and leave the grilling
to the pros.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.217
Two boxes for charcoal, Bobby.

01:47.257 --> 01:48.246
Two boxes!

01:48.291 --> 01:49.451
It's madness.

01:49.492 --> 01:50.481
I know!

01:50.527 --> 01:52.620
That really boils my...

01:52.662 --> 01:54.527
Makes me want to...

01:54.564 --> 01:55.758
Eh...

01:55.799 --> 01:57.892
I gotta level with you, Dad.

01:57.934 --> 01:59.902
I've just been picturing myself
on the roller coaster

01:59.936 --> 02:01.927
the whole time
you were talking.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.176
<i>If the election
were held today,</i>

02:09.211 --> 02:11.373
I would vote for...

02:11.414 --> 02:12.779
nobody!

02:14.117 --> 02:16.551
I know that elections
don't happen today.

02:16.586 --> 02:19.612
They happen on Tuesdays in
months ending in "vember."

02:21.057 --> 02:22.991
Why do you want
to talk to my mother?

02:23.026 --> 02:25.290
You know,
if I ever win the lotto,

02:25.328 --> 02:27.853
I'm gonna buy this house,
knock it down

02:27.897 --> 02:30.525
and build this house
on top of it.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.159
I am so sick of people

02:32.202 --> 02:34.136
calling and asking to speak with
the woman of the house

02:34.170 --> 02:36.536
and then treating me like
the baby of the house.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.767
Now, now, Luanne.

02:37.807 --> 02:39.172
Let's not be the
crybaby of the house.

02:39.209 --> 02:41.473
- Oh, my God.
- Look at this.

02:41.511 --> 02:43.479
The Baxter Death Mansion
is on the market.

02:43.513 --> 02:45.845
The scene of Arlen's
most notorious

02:45.882 --> 02:47.543
crime of passion!

02:47.584 --> 02:49.211
Also most exciting murder

02:49.252 --> 02:51.482
ever to happen
in a laundry room.

02:51.521 --> 02:53.751
Oh, yeah, I remember.

02:53.790 --> 02:56.918
The handsome millionaire
and his girlfriend

02:56.960 --> 02:58.621
were eloping to Switzerland,

02:58.661 --> 03:00.492
but they were tragically stopped

03:00.530 --> 03:03.226
by that crazy old woman
with the bad hair.

03:04.534 --> 03:05.694
And her gun.

03:05.735 --> 03:08.568
Luanne, that "crazy old woman"
was his wife.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.438
The one who put him through
medical school.

03:11.474 --> 03:13.066
Oh.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.634
Why don't you go play
with someone your own age.

03:15.678 --> 03:18.112
Hey, Connie baby-sitting
an eight-year-old.

03:18.147 --> 03:19.114
Give him a shot.

03:21.084 --> 03:22.210
Oh, my God.

03:22.252 --> 03:23.776
It's an open house!

03:23.820 --> 03:26.584
Ladies, get ready to
see five sunny bedrooms,

03:26.623 --> 03:29.353
eat-in kitchen,
and murder.

03:29.392 --> 03:31.053
Yep.

03:31.094 --> 03:32.061
Yup.

03:32.095 --> 03:34.529
Propane is excluded

03:34.564 --> 03:36.225
from the Texas State Fair.

03:38.735 --> 03:40.566
Boomhauer, are you insane?!

03:40.603 --> 03:43.401
I just told you
they excluded propane!

03:47.277 --> 03:48.642
You, too?!

03:48.678 --> 03:50.578
First, Bobby, and now you guys?

03:50.613 --> 03:52.046
Where's the outrage?

03:52.081 --> 03:53.571
Rules are rules, Hank.

03:53.616 --> 03:55.777
Without rules,
there would be chaos.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.981
That's why we no longer
visit the public pool.

03:59.022 --> 04:01.320
But... this is blatantly unfair!

04:01.357 --> 04:03.484
Yeah, poor, poor Hank.

04:03.526 --> 04:06.290
With his wife, and
his son, and his...

04:06.329 --> 04:07.796
hair.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.390
Nobody will let him
grill with propane.

04:12.969 --> 04:14.334
<i>Who's gonna show me</i>

04:14.370 --> 04:15.894
some rage?

04:17.874 --> 04:19.398
Dang it, I should be
calming you people down,

04:19.442 --> 04:22.002
telling you
there's no need for violence!

04:25.214 --> 04:27.182
Aw...

04:27.216 --> 04:29.684
Yeah, yeah, of course...
charcoal, propane, uh-huh.

04:29.719 --> 04:31.516
Hank, it's just a rule.

04:31.554 --> 04:33.818
I would never teach Italian
in my Spanish class,

04:33.856 --> 04:36.017
even though they are practically
the same language.

04:36.059 --> 04:36.821
Gotta go!

04:43.299 --> 04:45.494
To really get ready
for the Tilt-a-Whirl,

04:45.535 --> 04:48.026
I should've eaten a
few corn dogs first.

04:48.071 --> 04:49.971
If you want it to feel like
the Tilt-a-Whirl,

04:50.006 --> 04:53.134
you've got to tilt,
and snap your head around.

04:53.176 --> 04:55.542
Children, stop that!

04:55.578 --> 04:57.546
Play nicely!

04:57.580 --> 04:59.946
What are you talking
about, Luanne?

04:59.983 --> 05:01.473
Don't you sass me, young man!

05:01.517 --> 05:04.680
I am your elder, and I am
to be treated with respect.

05:10.326 --> 05:11.953
Wow.

05:11.995 --> 05:13.826
If you're going to be butchered
by a spurned wife,

05:13.863 --> 05:16.991
this would be
the place to do it.

05:17.033 --> 05:18.057
Any questions, ladies?

05:18.101 --> 05:19.261
No, that's okay.

05:19.302 --> 05:20.633
We're just going to take
a quick look around.

05:20.670 --> 05:21.967
Thank you.

05:22.005 --> 05:24.701
Oh, I'm afraid we're only
showing this house

05:24.741 --> 05:26.538
to potential buyers.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.043
No looky-loos.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.339
If you want to rubberneck,

05:29.379 --> 05:32.405
there was a pileup
out on highway 183.

05:32.448 --> 05:33.380
Looky-loos?

05:33.416 --> 05:34.610
Thanks for coming.

05:34.650 --> 05:36.515
Super. Just super.

05:36.552 --> 05:38.884
I could see my family
very happy here.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.115
Oh, wait...

05:40.156 --> 05:42.420
there is one
potential deal breaker.

05:42.458 --> 05:44.187
Is there a laundry room?

05:44.227 --> 05:46.127
Is there a laundry room?!

05:47.463 --> 05:49.328
We have <i>got</i> to come back.

05:49.365 --> 05:51.697
If we do not get to
see that laundry room,

05:51.734 --> 05:54.100
then the victim will
have died in vain.

05:55.371 --> 05:56.804
Smell that, girl.

05:56.839 --> 05:59.865
Is that the smell of
a second-class heat source?

06:03.646 --> 06:05.307
Who's all this food for?

06:05.348 --> 06:07.646
I don't even know any more.

06:07.683 --> 06:09.082
No one cares.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.348
Why not?
It smells so good.

06:11.387 --> 06:14.117
Exactly. That's because
you're smelling the food!

06:14.157 --> 06:15.556
See, if this were charcoal,

06:15.591 --> 06:17.889
all you'd smell
is that dang smoke!

06:17.927 --> 06:19.394
I hate smoke.

06:19.429 --> 06:22.227
It makes my mouth taste like
I kissed a guy who smokes.

06:22.265 --> 06:24.893
Not that you know
what it's like to kiss a guy.

06:24.934 --> 06:26.458
Well, no, some guys do,

06:26.502 --> 06:27.594
just not you.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.070
No, not me.

06:29.105 --> 06:31.005
But I see exactly
what you're saying.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.474
You prefer a cleaner-
burning fuel.

06:33.509 --> 06:35.306
That's what I was saying?

06:35.344 --> 06:37.539
And... you agree with me?

06:37.580 --> 06:39.207
Got dang right I do!

06:39.248 --> 06:40.613
You know what, Luanne...

06:40.650 --> 06:42.311
you just earned
yourself a burger!

06:42.351 --> 06:43.750
Go ahead and pick one out.

06:46.556 --> 06:49.992
...and that's why I decided
to go with State Farm.

06:50.026 --> 06:51.323
Wow!

06:51.360 --> 06:55.091
This is such a serious
grown-up conversation!

06:55.131 --> 06:58.100
I'm so tired of everybody
treating me like a child.

06:58.134 --> 07:01.297
Just because I live at home
and always have to bum rides,

07:01.337 --> 07:02.895
I still should be
taken seriously.

07:02.939 --> 07:04.372
Well, of course you should.

07:04.407 --> 07:06.432
It's just like those people
at the fair

07:06.476 --> 07:08.740
who won't take propane
seriously.

07:10.113 --> 07:11.205
You know what?

07:11.247 --> 07:13.215
I say we go down to that fair

07:13.249 --> 07:15.183
and set up a propane grill

07:15.218 --> 07:18.312
right across from
those stinky charcoal grills.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.185
Let the people see
what they're missing!

07:20.223 --> 07:24.159
You mean, like some sort of
crazy protest grill?

07:24.193 --> 07:27.526
That's not the kind of thing
I normally go in for...

07:27.563 --> 07:29.588
But they're
pushing around propane,

07:29.632 --> 07:32.567
and propane doesn't have arms
to push back with.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.601
Luanne... I'm in.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.232
We're a team.

07:40.409 --> 07:41.933
I want to celebrate!

07:41.978 --> 07:44.640
Toss another bucket of
propane on the fire!

07:44.680 --> 07:46.443
Uh, Luanne?

07:46.482 --> 07:48.780
Maybe I should get you
some brochures.

07:53.623 --> 07:55.147
What you doing, Uncle Hank?

07:55.191 --> 07:58.126
What I've done is I've
married the cold precision

07:58.161 --> 07:59.628
of the Vogner Char King

07:59.662 --> 08:03.428
with the fiery passion
of the Hoffman Meat Meister.

08:03.466 --> 08:05.024
I may have voided
all the warranties,

08:05.067 --> 08:06.159
but I don't even care.

08:06.202 --> 08:09.660
Look out, charcoal,
it's Supergrill!

08:09.705 --> 08:13.004
Yeah, I can make a poster
with Supergrill wearing a cape

08:13.042 --> 08:16.637
and saving people everywhere
with his magic rainbow of meats!

08:16.679 --> 08:18.374
I get it.
It's a catchy image.

08:18.414 --> 08:19.574
But...

08:19.615 --> 08:20.912
and here's my criticism...

08:20.950 --> 08:23.009
Okay, okay.
I'm an adult.

08:23.052 --> 08:24.952
I can handle criticism.

08:24.987 --> 08:28.286
Remember how you wanted
to be taken seriously?

08:28.324 --> 08:29.951
Well, so does propane.

08:29.992 --> 08:32.426
Sure a rainbow of meats
would be fun...

08:32.461 --> 08:34.554
great for a kid's bedroom...

08:34.597 --> 08:36.724
but we're looking
to change lives here.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.393
I understand.

08:38.433 --> 08:40.458
Great. Now we've got
a lot to do

08:40.503 --> 08:42.299
with just three days
until the fair:

08:42.337 --> 08:44.602
Build the grill,
print up the pamphlets,

08:44.640 --> 08:47.404
fact-check the pamphlets,
design a char pattern.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.842
And that's just for starters.

08:48.878 --> 08:52.609
Hey, I bet I could get
some people down at the college

08:52.648 --> 08:53.546
to help us.

08:53.583 --> 08:54.982
I still know where it is!

08:55.017 --> 08:56.348
That's a great idea!

08:56.385 --> 08:59.013
Luanne, I am officially
designating you

08:59.055 --> 09:00.647
recruitment coordinator.

09:02.024 --> 09:04.857
That could have been us
protesting for propane

09:04.894 --> 09:06.589
with Hank right now.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.496
Gentlemen, we dodged
a very boring bullet.

09:09.532 --> 09:12.365
I mean, I love ol' Hank, man,
but got dang man,

09:12.401 --> 09:15.131
talkin' 'bout propane,
propane, propane, man,

09:15.171 --> 09:17.298
How' 'bout talkin' 'bout
what <i>I</i> do for a living, man.

09:17.340 --> 09:20.741
Poor Bobby, being
replaced by Luanne.

09:20.776 --> 09:24.837
My dad replaced me
with TV and the bottle.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.144
Hey, we should let Bobby hang
with us.

09:27.183 --> 09:28.616
Seems the least we could do.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.948
Now, when we ask him,

09:29.986 --> 09:31.647
try not to seem too needy.

09:31.687 --> 09:32.779
And if he says no,

09:32.822 --> 09:34.949
pretend like we didn't
want him, anyway.

09:38.427 --> 09:39.655
Vote no on Prop 12!

09:39.695 --> 09:41.322
Stop the Otter slaughter!

09:41.364 --> 09:42.558
Ban the Canon!

09:46.335 --> 09:48.997
Wow, it looks like
you hate everything.

09:49.038 --> 09:51.802
Do you think you could
hate charcoal, too?

09:51.841 --> 09:54.241
I think you could persuade me.

09:54.277 --> 09:57.007
Okay, everyone, let 'em hear it!

09:57.046 --> 09:58.673
No blood for...

09:58.714 --> 09:59.681
Hi!

09:59.715 --> 10:01.046
Hi.
Hey.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.607
'Sup?

10:02.652 --> 10:05.052
Now, who's ready To put on

10:05.087 --> 10:08.955
a serious protest
with me and Uncle Hank?

10:08.991 --> 10:10.015
Charcoal is murder!

10:10.059 --> 10:11.822
Ooh, that's so good.

10:11.861 --> 10:15.228
Dude, things that are murder
is my thing.

10:15.264 --> 10:17.095
Smoke is murder!

10:17.133 --> 10:18.760
No blood for charcoal!

10:18.801 --> 10:22.100
Uncle Hank is going
to be so excited!

10:22.138 --> 10:24.333
Luanne, this Uncle Hank,
he's a real uncle,

10:24.373 --> 10:25.465
not an older dude

10:25.508 --> 10:27.442
who's, like,
your boyfriend, right?

10:27.476 --> 10:30.445
You know what?
I am the babe around here.

10:30.479 --> 10:32.879
I'm not going
to become the Mom.

10:32.915 --> 10:34.246
<i>Hey, Uncle Hank</i>.

10:34.283 --> 10:37.081
Oh, hey, Luanne.
How'd it go at the college?

10:37.119 --> 10:38.381
Great! I got a team!

10:38.421 --> 10:40.116
They're focused and committed.

10:40.156 --> 10:41.145
I can't wait for you

10:41.190 --> 10:42.350
to see all the signs we made.

10:42.391 --> 10:45.918
Uh, no rainbows
or smiley faces, right?

10:45.961 --> 10:49.419
Uncle Hank, we're looking
to change lives here.

10:49.465 --> 10:51.126
Well, all right, Luanne.
Great job.

10:54.136 --> 10:57.435
Just follow my lead
and get ready to gloat.

10:59.508 --> 11:02.671
Oh, you gals don't
have jobs, do you?

11:02.712 --> 11:06.148
Like I said:
Potential buyers only.

11:06.182 --> 11:08.275
How's this for potential?

11:08.317 --> 11:11.616
We will give you $200,000
over asking price.

11:12.822 --> 11:14.847
Yeah, I bet you
didn't see that coming.

11:14.890 --> 11:16.653
Now show us the
damn laundry room.

11:16.692 --> 11:17.681
Peggy, what are you doing?

11:17.727 --> 11:18.887
Relax, Nancy.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.828
We're not really
going to buy the house.

11:20.863 --> 11:22.854
We're just going
to put in a bogus bid,

11:22.898 --> 11:25.128
and the whole thing
will fall apart during escrow.

11:25.167 --> 11:26.191
Hey, looky-loos!

11:26.235 --> 11:27.600
Out of my kitchen!

11:27.636 --> 11:30.764
Of course, we will need
some earnest money.

11:30.806 --> 11:34.367
Which, on your
generous offer, comes out to...

11:34.410 --> 11:36.241
$15,000.

11:37.346 --> 11:40.406
Fine.
Drive me to the bank.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.041
Yep.

11:42.084 --> 11:43.847
Yup.

11:43.886 --> 11:45.376
Yep.

11:45.421 --> 11:46.979
Okay.

11:47.022 --> 11:48.387
So, Bobby, are you upset

11:48.424 --> 11:50.984
by Luanne usurping
your first-born male right

11:51.026 --> 11:52.186
of prima-grillature?

11:52.228 --> 11:54.128
Are you kidding?

11:54.163 --> 11:56.461
I'm just hoping she can throw
a football, too,

11:56.499 --> 11:58.364
because then I'm home free!

11:58.401 --> 12:01.336
That is a great attitude, Bobby.

12:01.370 --> 12:03.235
You know, we should have done
this years ago.

12:03.272 --> 12:05.900
So, I can see why
you guys like this,

12:05.941 --> 12:09.240
but I've got two weeks'
allowance in my pocket

12:09.278 --> 12:11.246
that's screaming state fair.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.713
I say let's do it.

12:12.748 --> 12:14.215
Dang ol' good call.

12:14.250 --> 12:17.811
You're as good at telling me
what to do as your dad is.

12:19.288 --> 12:21.119
Howdy, folks!

12:21.157 --> 12:24.820
Today: Clog dancing unlimited,

12:24.860 --> 12:28.796
State grill-off,
the world's smallest hippo.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.355
Propane?
That's a fine fuel.

12:30.399 --> 12:32.924
But it ain't no match
for a mesquite mix took

12:32.968 --> 12:35.232
my Grandpa 19 years
to get perfect.

12:35.271 --> 12:38.832
With all due respect, sir,
it's not a fair competition

12:38.874 --> 12:41.775
unless all heat sources
are welcomed.

12:41.811 --> 12:44.211
All we ask for
is an equal chance.

12:44.246 --> 12:46.043
Well, a man can respect that.

12:46.081 --> 12:49.107
Once my team gets here,
you will get all the steak

12:49.151 --> 12:52.552
and information you need
to make an informed choice.

12:52.588 --> 12:54.215
Hey-hey! Ho-ho!

12:54.256 --> 12:56.781
Your deadly smoke
has got to go!

12:56.826 --> 12:58.453
Cough-cough! Choke-choke!

12:58.494 --> 12:59.290
What the?

12:59.328 --> 13:01.125
Oh, God, protest kids.

13:01.163 --> 13:02.824
Get a job!
Hey-hey! Ho-ho!

13:02.865 --> 13:05.333
Propane is the way to go!

13:05.367 --> 13:06.766
Ready, everyone?

13:06.802 --> 13:07.791
Finger of Shame!

13:07.837 --> 13:11.500
Shame! Shame!

13:11.540 --> 13:13.565
Hi, Uncle Hank!

13:13.609 --> 13:14.576
Luanne?!

13:14.610 --> 13:16.840
That gal is on your team?!

13:16.879 --> 13:18.938
Sir, I swear to you, I...

13:18.981 --> 13:20.744
'Kay everybody, die-in!

13:26.489 --> 13:27.820
Luanne, what...

13:27.857 --> 13:28.846
I can't...

13:28.891 --> 13:29.858
What?!

13:29.892 --> 13:31.086
Isn't this great?

13:31.126 --> 13:33.060
No! It's horrible!

13:33.095 --> 13:34.562
Didn't you hear a word I said?

13:34.597 --> 13:36.292
Yes! I heard
all of them!

13:36.332 --> 13:38.027
Look how serious we are.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.762
Jason is dressed as Death.

13:39.802 --> 13:42.100
What is more serious
than Death?

13:42.137 --> 13:44.765
No! No! Luanne,
you're off the team!

13:44.807 --> 13:47.105
What?! But I'm trying...

13:47.142 --> 13:48.871
I don't care
what you're trying!

13:48.911 --> 13:50.401
Now get away from my grill.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.141
Luanne?

13:53.182 --> 13:55.275
But we haven't
had our puke-in yet!

13:55.317 --> 13:57.342
Luanne! Luanne!

14:00.856 --> 14:04.155
I really do think
propane is great.

14:04.193 --> 14:07.321
It's a better heat
source than charcoal.

14:07.363 --> 14:09.490
It just is!

14:09.532 --> 14:12.626
I, uh, know what
you're going through.

14:12.668 --> 14:15.728
I'm old enough
to help propane by myself.

14:15.771 --> 14:19.207
I'll show him.
I just have to figure out how.

14:19.241 --> 14:20.230
And when.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.903
You've got
to do something big.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.571
You gotta get his attention,

14:23.612 --> 14:25.239
like, move out of his house.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.943
I mean, you could totally crash
with me.

14:27.983 --> 14:31.680
Thursday night,
livestock show!

14:31.720 --> 14:33.187
Free diabetes screenings!

14:33.222 --> 14:36.589
I could crash with you...

14:36.625 --> 14:38.525
or do something bigger.

14:42.231 --> 14:43.289
Uh, sir?

14:43.332 --> 14:46.495
That circus did not
represent propane.

14:46.535 --> 14:49.231
If you would just
give propane another chance.

14:49.271 --> 14:53.139
Sunday night,
salute to the Pecan,

14:53.175 --> 14:54.233
Thursd...

14:56.478 --> 14:58.343
Attention, Texas.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.177
Charcoal is murder!!

15:00.215 --> 15:01.341
Luanne?

15:01.383 --> 15:03.112
Grill with propane!

15:03.152 --> 15:08.556
If you don't use propane,
I'm going to stomp on you!

15:08.591 --> 15:11.219
Um, how do I move the legs?

15:11.260 --> 15:13.558
Taste the meat, not the heat!

15:19.368 --> 15:21.268
Listen, Texas.

15:21.303 --> 15:24.295
Our forests are dying
to make the charcoal

15:24.340 --> 15:27.832
to burn the flesh of the cows
you've murdered!

15:27.876 --> 15:31.403
But there is another way:
Propane.

15:31.447 --> 15:33.472
Just be careful who you trust.

15:33.515 --> 15:34.482
Dang it!

15:34.516 --> 15:35.983
Yeah, we tried that.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.485
She's got her own megaphone.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.578
We can't do much
besides wait her out.

15:40.623 --> 15:41.851
Shoot.

15:41.890 --> 15:43.619
That's his first hit,
out of the dozen.

15:43.659 --> 15:45.854
Lot of times, these kids
don't even nick me.

15:45.894 --> 15:47.122
Are you just gonna take that?

15:47.162 --> 15:49.062
Well, what with
the lawsuits and all...

15:49.098 --> 15:51.828
But, as I say, we got it
under control.

15:51.867 --> 15:55.735
Huh. Anyway, I have to ask you
to clear the area.

15:55.771 --> 15:57.602
I'm not the one throwing eggs!

15:57.640 --> 16:00.040
Sir, please don't make my
job any more difficult.

16:00.075 --> 16:02.407
Ha, ha! Babylon is going down!

16:02.444 --> 16:04.036
Take that, Herr Fuhrer!

16:05.381 --> 16:06.905
There he is!

16:06.949 --> 16:08.314
Hank Hill, who thinks

16:08.350 --> 16:11.114
he's the only one
who cares about propane.

16:11.153 --> 16:12.450
Shame on him!

16:12.488 --> 16:14.513
Shame!

16:14.556 --> 16:15.523
Shaaaaame!

16:15.557 --> 16:16.524
LUANNE That's right,

16:16.558 --> 16:17.650
run away!

16:17.693 --> 16:18.955
Shaaaame!

16:18.994 --> 16:21.622
Turn the wheel, Mr. Dauterive!
Turn the wheel!!

16:23.832 --> 16:25.800
Bobby, this is what
it would look like

16:25.834 --> 16:27.665
if Boomhauer and me had a baby.

16:27.703 --> 16:29.398
So what should we do now,
Bobby?

16:29.438 --> 16:31.269
Can I have a fried twinkie?

16:33.575 --> 16:34.599
Wait!

16:34.643 --> 16:35.610
Don't-don't leave me!

16:38.447 --> 16:41.416
So, if we grill the forest,

16:41.450 --> 16:44.146
where are, like, squirrels
supposed to live?

16:44.186 --> 16:45.744
Luanne! Courage!

16:45.788 --> 16:47.983
Can I get you
anything, <i>please?!</i>

16:48.023 --> 16:51.288
A diet soda and...
maybe a sandwich.

16:51.326 --> 16:54.022
Oh, and could you
bring me up a bucket?

16:54.063 --> 16:56.623
I have to go
to the ladies room.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.395
Mrs. Hill,
your mortgage payments

17:01.437 --> 17:03.496
would be 300%
of your household income,

17:03.539 --> 17:07.236
which is what we in the business
call a "tough nut."

17:09.511 --> 17:11.979
I'm gonna level with you.

17:12.013 --> 17:14.811
I just wanted to see
the freakin' laundry room!

17:14.849 --> 17:17.785
Hmm. This is the
Baxter Death Mansion?

17:17.819 --> 17:20.084
Yep. And Miss
"Number One on the Westside"

17:20.122 --> 17:23.090
thinks you have to be a
millionaire just to get a peek.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.619
I think we can
work something out.

17:34.236 --> 17:37.103
I'm sending something down.

17:38.507 --> 17:40.634
And you're sure
this thing is loud?

17:40.676 --> 17:41.938
How's this?!

17:41.977 --> 17:43.638
O-Okay, fine. I'll take it.

17:43.679 --> 17:45.306
$55.99.

17:45.347 --> 17:46.575
Stop that!

17:47.916 --> 17:51.044
Boy, it's hot in here.

17:51.086 --> 17:52.553
Where's my sandwich?

17:52.588 --> 17:54.715
Luanne, can you hear me?

17:54.757 --> 17:55.655
Yes.

17:55.691 --> 17:57.158
Then get the heck down here!

17:57.192 --> 17:59.183
You're acting like
a complete jackass!

17:59.228 --> 18:00.559
Uh, sir,

18:00.596 --> 18:03.121
you're not authorized
to negotiate with that subject.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.792
This is my protest!

18:04.833 --> 18:06.357
Why are you against me?!

18:06.401 --> 18:10.030
I was trying to help you
with your propane!

18:10.072 --> 18:11.369
Hank,

18:11.406 --> 18:12.236
what's going on?

18:12.274 --> 18:13.639
It's Luanne.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.143
She's ticked off at me,
and she's commandeered Big Tex.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.408
I've got to find some way
to get her down.

18:18.447 --> 18:20.176
Aah, it's Big Tex!

18:20.215 --> 18:22.410
Maybe you should ask Big Bob.

18:22.451 --> 18:23.918
Hmm...

18:23.952 --> 18:27.149
This is a lot like the time
I locked myself in my room

18:27.189 --> 18:28.679
and wouldn't come out.

18:28.724 --> 18:31.056
Do you remember
how you got me out?

18:31.093 --> 18:33.687
Yeah. I put candy outside
your door and told you

18:33.729 --> 18:35.720
you had five minutes
before I ate it.

18:35.764 --> 18:37.061
Go for it, Dad.

18:37.099 --> 18:38.930
Look, Luanne's an adult.

18:38.967 --> 18:41.936
Treating her like a kid
is not gonna...

18:41.970 --> 18:43.938
Oh, Lord.

18:43.972 --> 18:47.931
Uh, sir, I think
I can get her down.

18:47.976 --> 18:53.243
Uh, folks, I sort of have
to say something to my niece.

18:53.282 --> 18:54.647
It's kind of private,

18:54.683 --> 18:57.584
so if you could all put
your fingers in your ears...

19:00.322 --> 19:01.289
All right. Fine.

19:01.323 --> 19:03.348
Uh, Luanne,

19:03.392 --> 19:06.020
I, uh, understand
why you're mad at me.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.086
You did something
I don't agree with

19:08.130 --> 19:11.588
and I, uh, treated you
like a child.

19:11.633 --> 19:14.329
And that was wrong of me
because, uh...

19:14.369 --> 19:16.701
I... owe you a lot.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.205
Uh... but

19:18.240 --> 19:20.538
working with you is, uh,
you know,

19:20.576 --> 19:23.101
the whole reason
I'm even here today,

19:23.145 --> 19:27.775
and even though I still think
what you're doing is asinine,

19:27.816 --> 19:31.752
if you come down here, we can
talk about it... like adults.

19:39.361 --> 19:40.919
Uncle Hank,

19:40.963 --> 19:43.261
I'm coming down.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.763
Well, this blows chunks.

19:49.838 --> 19:51.738
Yeah!

19:55.310 --> 19:58.302
Dude, you just
nailed a real cop!

20:00.148 --> 20:01.172
Oh, crap!

20:01.216 --> 20:02.183
Run!

20:10.525 --> 20:12.049
A front-loader.

20:12.094 --> 20:14.085
Wow!

20:15.264 --> 20:17.129
Thanks for coming
down, Luanne.

20:18.333 --> 20:19.766
Well, Officer,

20:19.801 --> 20:20.995
I'm an adult now,

20:21.036 --> 20:24.199
and I'm ready to do
what grown-up people do:

20:24.239 --> 20:26.173
Go to jail.

20:26.208 --> 20:28.676
Sir, I guess the two of us
are in this together.

20:28.710 --> 20:31.645
I think my report is going to
say that while we were busy

20:31.680 --> 20:32.977
with a violent situation,

20:33.015 --> 20:34.710
a non-violent offender
walked off,

20:34.750 --> 20:36.615
and we were unable
to locate her.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.480
Come on, get out of here.

20:39.521 --> 20:41.284
Thank you, officer.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.223
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:43.258 --> 20:46.557
Ms. Platter, I think
we'd better get out of here

20:46.595 --> 20:48.028
while we still can.

20:48.063 --> 20:51.396
Mr. Hill, I think you
have a very good point.

20:55.404 --> 20:56.928
So I have to ask:

20:56.972 --> 21:00.430
Is Big Tex as amazing inside
as he is from the outside?

21:00.475 --> 21:01.840
Yeah.

21:01.877 --> 21:03.811
You think you're gonna
be really nervous,

21:03.845 --> 21:05.642
because, like,
he's Big Tex and all,

21:05.681 --> 21:08.377
but, actually,
he's very down-to-earth.

21:08.417 --> 21:11.682
Really, like being inside
of a regular giant guy.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.449
A man of the people.

21:13.488 --> 21:15.080
I knew it.

21:15.123 --> 21:21.889
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

21:24.299 --> 21:26.130
Howdy, folks.

21:26.168 --> 21:29.296
Today: Steak grill-off.

21:29.338 --> 21:32.796
Clog-dancing unlimited.

21:32.841 --> 21:36.299
The world's smallest hippo.

21:36.345 --> 21:38.540
Howdy.

21:38.580 --> 21:42.539
Thursday night: Livestock show.

21:42.584 --> 21:46.543
Free diabetes screenings.

21:46.588 --> 21:49.022
Howdy.

21:49.057 --> 21:52.993
Sunday night:
Salute to the pecan.

21:53.028 --> 21:55.622
<i>Talkin' 'bout an ol' propane,
propane, propane.</i>
