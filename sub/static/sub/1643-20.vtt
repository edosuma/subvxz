SCOFIELD: <i>Previously on</i> Prison Break:

00:03.045 --> 00:05.672
I want him under 24-hour surveillance.

00:06.256 --> 00:08.007
I have to be there when they kill this man.

00:08.090 --> 00:10.636
The least you could do is review his case.

00:10.928 --> 00:11.970
<i>REYNOLDS: Terrence.</i>

00:12.054 --> 00:13.639
The thing I can't quite figure is

00:13.722 --> 00:16.308
with the crap storm this thing's become

00:16.391 --> 00:18.435
<i>why they haven't killed you.</i>

00:18.519 --> 00:19.937
Have at it.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.319
Now, out of respect
for what you once were,

00:27.402 --> 00:29.738
I'm going to let you walk away.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.292
Why don't you
just hand me that shank you're holding?

00:46.463 --> 00:48.131
I'm not even sure why you need it.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.174
Thank you.

00:49.258 --> 00:52.427
Your keys, they were right over there
by your in-box.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.972
Well, you got a maintenance guy
waiting outside here,

00:55.055 --> 00:56.682
says you want him to change the locks.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.767
Want me to call him off?

01:00.310 --> 01:01.436
No, send him in.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.021
It's your last chance, Tweener.

01:03.105 --> 01:05.524
Scofield and his whole Pl crew,

01:08.026 --> 01:09.695
they're escaping.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.757
You know I can't let you leave here, boss.

I've been apprehended

02:25.103 --> 02:26.605
while trying to elude the authorities,

02:26.688 --> 02:29.316
it's always because of the damn dogs.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.908
Turns out you can run
from just about everything in your life

02:37.991 --> 02:39.576
except your own particular stink.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.079
Yeah, well, some of us stink
more than others.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.998
Kinte, you can smell
like a bouquet of bonbons,

02:45.082 --> 02:47.250
but unless you get rid of your smell

02:47.334 --> 02:49.002
you might as well
send a note to the police

02:49.086 --> 02:50.796
with directions and some cab fare.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.964
You know, Theodore's right, man.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.258
We gotta scrub down our cells.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.427
- What about our bunks?
- Pillows, sheets, everything.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.680
Either get rid of your smell or change it.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.104
Well, how much time we got?

03:07.187 --> 03:08.730
- SCOFIELD: John?
- Three days.

03:08.814 --> 03:12.734
That's the soonest I could get us
into the guards' room for Pl.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.112
You think you'll have
the extra suits by then?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.531
Probably. They should be here tomorrow.

03:17.614 --> 03:18.949
Good, so we're good to go.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.200
All we got left is figuring out

03:20.283 --> 03:22.661
how to get through that door
in the infirmary.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.121
How to get Linc out of that box.

03:24.204 --> 03:28.625
- And you can do that in three days?
- Three days should be plenty of time.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.129
We got to get out of here.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.131
Now.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.543
I don't know how he found it. He just did.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.919
SUCRE: So the hole's just sitting there?

04:13.003 --> 04:16.005
I covered it the best I could,
but it's just a matter of time

04:16.089 --> 04:18.341
before someone discovers
Bellick's missing.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.843
What do you mean Bellick's missing?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.732
Okay, okay, okay. Fox River is a big place.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.150
Maybe they won't notice for a while.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.778
Nothing happens around here
without Bellick's say so.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.696
Somebody is gonna notice
that he's missing.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.990
And when they do,
they're gonna close this place down

04:42.073 --> 04:43.366
until they find him.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.576
What are we gonna do?

04:44.659 --> 04:48.079
As soon as it gets dark, we go.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.248
- SUCRE: Tonight?
- Pretty, we ain't ready to escape tonight.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.458
Escape already started.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.043
It started
the minute Bellick found that hole.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.629
And it's gonna end the minute
they figure out that he's missing.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.047
Then stay!

04:58.381 --> 05:00.383
I'll be sure to read the papers
in the morning.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.385
See how many years you got
when they realized

05:02.469 --> 05:05.889
which crew was working in that room
and dug that hole.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.560
So what's the play, man?

05:11.561 --> 05:13.939
Do you think you can have
the plane ready by tonight?

05:14.022 --> 05:15.148
Sure.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.359
- You had kitchen duty, right?
- Yeah.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.027
What'd you use to scrub down the floors?

05:19.110 --> 05:21.279
I don't know. I think it was some peroxide,
or something like that.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.532
That'll work. Get as much as you can.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.117
I'll work on getting us
that key to the infirmary.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.577
The rest of you find whatever you can

05:27.661 --> 05:29.120
to get rid of the scent in your cells.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.248
None of this matters
if we can't get in the guards' room.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.457
We're gonna leave after dinner,

05:32.541 --> 05:34.084
during tier time when the gates are open.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.753
7:00, one by one, through my cell.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.589
Whoa, whoa. No, we were supposed
to go through the guards' room.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.924
That was going to give us a head start,

05:41.007 --> 05:42.676
hours before they even found out
we were missing.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.636
We leave through your cell,
we ain't got no lead time.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.722
-7:00. Count's at 8:00, that's only...
- Sixty minutes.

05:47.806 --> 05:51.184
Sixty minutes to get over that wall
and as far away from here as possible.

You know, there's one thing
we didn't talk about out there.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.083
Your brother.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.419
I mean, he's under 24-hour surveillance.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.797
I'm just saying,
if you can't get to him by tonight,

06:21.006 --> 06:23.842
we still have to go, you know that, right?

06:50.410 --> 06:51.620
What do you want?

06:51.703 --> 06:53.246
My brother's in Gen Pop.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.999
He's got no clue I was in an accident.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.375
So?

06:57.459 --> 07:00.670
Well, is there any way
I can get a message to him?

07:00.921 --> 07:03.006
Yeah. Put it in your will.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.853
And you're sure all those dots connect?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.521
Okay. Thank you.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.566
- Who was that?
- A friend of mine at the title company,

07:21.650 --> 07:23.443
handled a lot of my firm's business.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.779
She dug up an address
for that phone number in Blackfoot.

07:25.862 --> 07:26.905
Where is it?

07:26.988 --> 07:29.366
It's not the where that's interesting,
it's the how.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.284
It turns out our little place in Montana

07:31.368 --> 07:34.913
was purchased for $2 million
by an offshore holding corporation.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.749
Well, that's pretty standard
for a transaction that size, though, right?

07:37.832 --> 07:41.711
Sure. Only this holding corporation
was bankrolled by a trust.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.131
A trust financed
by the estate of Terrence Steadman.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.552
Looks like you and I
are going to Blackfoot, Montana.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.821
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

08:10.115 --> 08:12.492

- No.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.411
- Why?
- Mack was asking.

08:14.494 --> 08:18.123
- I guess he ain't showed up yet.
-(CHUCKLING) He's probably just late.

08:18.415 --> 08:22.002
Bellick? I haven't beat that guy to work
in eight years.

08:22.293 --> 08:25.046
Scofield, this ain't Gibsons. Move.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.342
They're already starting
to ask questions, man.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.219
We're not gonna
make it out of here in seven hours

08:31.302 --> 08:33.513
without them finding the answers.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.765
How we coming with that peroxide?

08:35.849 --> 08:38.268
I'm gonna need it
before we meet up for yard duty.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.145
Probably not till later.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.230
You wanna tell me what you need it for?

08:51.197 --> 08:53.742
Makkos, you going to be
eating them there Brussels sprouts?

08:53.825 --> 08:54.951
No.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.203
- You mind if I...
- Take them.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.247
They smell like crap.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.041
Do they, now?

09:12.927 --> 09:14.262
What's up?

09:17.974 --> 09:20.143
- Yo, if you got...
- Tonight.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.063
- What?
- Change of plans.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.984
- Why, did something happen?
- Just find Sucre.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.153
He'll tell you
what you need to do to be ready.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.363
- But what about the...
- Tonight.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.915
MAN: What the hell's going on?

09:41.998 --> 09:44.042
The President changed his mind.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.711
We were given assurances
he would veto the energy bill.

09:46.795 --> 09:50.173
Assurances can tell you everything
that a man is going to do

09:50.256 --> 09:53.718
until he wakes up in the morning
and changes his mind.

09:53.802 --> 09:57.138
- Then change it back.
- I don't think you understand.

09:57.222 --> 10:00.350
- The President...
- Have you enjoyed our support?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.353
- Yes.
- Good.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.855
We certainly wouldn't want you
to take it for granted.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.109
- Are you threatening me?
- Why? Do you feel threatened?

10:09.192 --> 10:11.236
Caroline, we've all been
through this before,

10:11.319 --> 10:14.030
the ebbs and flows of political conscience,

10:14.114 --> 10:16.825
but we've found at the end of the day
we get what we want.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.493
It's simply a matter of who helps us get it.

10:18.576 --> 10:22.413
If you can't convince a doddering old fool
finishing up his second term

10:22.497 --> 10:24.958
what the best thing is
for this country's economy,

10:25.041 --> 10:28.586
perhaps you're not the kind of helper
we're looking for.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.938
Sara.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.357
- I was thinking about something...
- Enough, Michael.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.902
Enough with the lies and the coincidences
and the stories, all of it.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.988
- It's not what you think.
- I know what you did.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.199
The question is,
are you man enough to admit it?

10:59.534 --> 11:00.827
The keys.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.707
Congratulations. Is that the first time
you've been honest with me?

11:05.790 --> 11:07.625
- It's not...
- The second?

11:07.709 --> 11:09.627
What are you after, Michael?

11:09.711 --> 11:13.006
- Is it drugs? Is it needles?
- Neither.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.757
Then what?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.972
Please understand that I never meant...

11:22.849 --> 11:25.351
I never wanted to involve you in this.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.520
Well, you've done a pretty poor job of that.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.064
I came here to tell you something.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.943
I'm getting my brother out of here.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.278
Tonight.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.490
And I need your help.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.344
Michael, honestly, for your own good,
don't say anything more.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.595
You know he's innocent.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.013
Do what you're talking about
and he won't be.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.139
But he'll still be alive.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.392
You understand that I'm required
to report everything you're telling me.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.810
- Yes.
- Then why would you?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.479
Because you're the only one that can help.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.731
And because I know
you want to be part of the solution.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.775
Yeah, aiding and abetting
is not part of the solution.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.319
Neither is doing nothing
knowing what you know about his case.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.154
How dare you put this on me.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.490
I did what I could.
I gave my father the information...

12:20.573 --> 12:24.494
No offense to your father,
but the people who are framing Lincoln,

12:24.577 --> 12:26.621
let's just say they have
a higher security clearance.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.123
- So now it's a conspiracy?
- I didn't come here to have a debate.

12:29.207 --> 12:32.210
- You're asking me to break the law.
- I'm asking you to make a mistake.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.796
Not hurt anyone, not steal anything.

12:34.879 --> 12:38.174
Just forget to lock up.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.303
Leave the door unlocked
when you leave tonight.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.721
That's it.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.224
Please.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.271
This is where you're breaking out of?
This room?

12:53.189 --> 12:56.401
There are alarm contacts
on the glass surrounding the door.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.444
Otherwise, I wouldn't need you to...

12:58.528 --> 13:00.530
I was part of your plan.

13:03.366 --> 13:07.078
- Was it all an act?
- At first, yes.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.873
I needed to be here.

13:12.333 --> 13:16.045
- But then I wanted to be here with you.
- Right.

13:16.462 --> 13:20.174
And it's killing me to know
that you'll never believe that.

13:20.258 --> 13:24.053
Whatever you may think of me,
this is about Lincoln.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.766
Don't make him pay for my mistakes.

there were seven or eight guys.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.608
Well, not everybody gonna have a ticket.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.985
You gonna tell me who is?

I don't know, Vegas, 2:00 a.m., maybe,
but if she didn't have such a big booty.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.594
Man, the booty is the man's
biggest weakness.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.680
I know I would've hit it.

Do you know if he went somewheres?

Do I look like his mother?

- The bastard and the born again.

They both want out of here.
They'll behave until then.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.545
Think so?

17:26.628 --> 17:29.006
I just picked this off of T-Bag yesterday.

- Well, for health reasons,

disseminated a little more pronto.

there's one more thing that can go wrong.

to call you as my sponsor,

- I wouldn't recommend it.
- No.

22:21.966 --> 22:24.927
Well, I feel very fortunate to have met you.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.763
Yeah. I'm guessing
not many structural engineers

22:27.847 --> 22:29.390
make their way into Fox River.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.141
No, no, I don't mean
because of your vocation.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.643
I mean because
you're a decent young man,

22:32.726 --> 22:35.187
and there are not many of those
who make their way into Fox River.

there are a few down there.

Well, let's just say that I owe you one.

this whole time, it was never about me.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.174
It was about Dad.

I can't believe it.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.680
Michael. Michael!

23:10.472 --> 23:12.808
- What?
- You got something you want to tell me?

23:12.892 --> 23:14.894
Just told you everything we knew
about Dad was a lie,

23:14.977 --> 23:16.896
and you barely blinked.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.858
We have to go. Tonight.

so either we go now or it's over.

Look, I know it's gonna be tight,
but I can do this.

- Michael, stop it.
- The chains on your locks, they're...

- I can do this!

23:37.041 --> 23:38.500

23:39.418 --> 23:43.088
- Go. You gotta go.
- Don't say that.

23:44.173 --> 23:47.593
Look at me! You can't do this.
There's not enough time.

23:47.968 --> 23:51.597

they'll nail you and you'll rot in here.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.377
- What?
- I'm considering making a switch,

behind Senator Challis.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.260
Okay, let's get this thing down to the car.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.721
- We'll do it all together on three.
- All right.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.514
- Ready? One.
- Ready.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.433
Two. Three.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.936
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Put it down, put it down, put it down.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.567
All right, get Scofield up here right away!

31:02.569 --> 31:04.071
It's working.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.698
All right, get them out and get them dry.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.950
We got to get them on under our clothes
before tier time,

31:09.034 --> 31:11.161
which is in 45 minutes.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.955
- You think everyone else will be ready?
- We don't have a choice.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.374
As soon as the gate's open, we go.

31:15.457 --> 31:16.833
And we're gonna need every second.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.293
Open on 40.

31:21.463 --> 31:24.674
- Scofield, Pope needs to see you, ASAP.
- Now?

31:24.758 --> 31:27.302
- What for?
- A bar mitzvah. Let's go.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.138
- It's 6:15, bro. You can't...
- Now!

31:33.308 --> 31:35.310
(BUZZER SOUNDING)

31:45.987 --> 31:48.281
<i>Hey, pretty, flak-took.</i>

32:39.875 --> 32:41.543
(CHATTERING)

32:46.047 --> 32:47.841
Excuse me a minute.

32:50.886 --> 32:53.472
(SIGHING) Sara, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

32:53.555 --> 32:55.432
I guess to congratulations.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.392
Can't believe I had to hear about it
on the news.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.394
Oh, the VP thing. Well, that's just talk.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.562
- Is it?
- Yeah.

33:00.645 --> 33:01.855
What was it your mother used to say?

33:01.938 --> 33:03.773
"It's always nice
to be invited to the dance,

33:03.857 --> 33:06.067
"even if you don't have the right shoes."

33:06.151 --> 33:08.361
Yeah. She also used to say,
"Your father's a lying bastard,"

33:08.445 --> 33:11.448
but I figured
that was just the booze talking.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.492
You know,
it's always nice to see you, Sara.

33:13.575 --> 33:14.743
Is there something that you needed?

33:14.826 --> 33:17.120
- Or did you just come by to...
- Just tell me something.

33:17.204 --> 33:20.707
Did you look at the information I gave you
from Lincoln Burrows' attorneys?

33:20.790 --> 33:21.917
Sweetheart, move on.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.045
The man's attorneys had a window
to present new evidence, they didn't.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.713
Now that window is closed.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.924
I just need to know,
did you look at the information?

33:29.007 --> 33:31.092
- Come on, Sara.
- Answer me.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.554
I swear,
working at Fox River has changed you.

33:34.638 --> 33:36.556
You're always saying
you want to make a difference?

33:36.640 --> 33:38.892
At that place? It's too late.

33:38.975 --> 33:41.269
You should be a teacher,
so that you can get to these people

33:41.353 --> 33:43.647
-before they become...
- Did you look at the information?

33:43.730 --> 33:45.357
I didn't need to.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.777
I supported the findings of the court.

33:49.152 --> 33:52.239
If you have a problem with the verdict,
go after them.

33:52.322 --> 33:55.075
But before you do,
I suggest you look at the guy's rap sheet

33:55.158 --> 33:57.285
and ask yourself
if the world will be a better place

33:57.369 --> 33:58.870
with Lincoln Burrows walking the streets.

33:58.954 --> 33:59.955
Just tell me one thing.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.456
Did they promise you the vice presidency

34:01.540 --> 34:04.417
before or after
you signed his death warrant?

34:04.501 --> 34:07.254
I will not discuss morality
with an addict and a thief.

34:07.337 --> 34:08.922
You want to talk reality, Sara?

34:09.005 --> 34:11.341
How many times did I use my influence
to keep you

34:11.424 --> 34:13.635
and one of yourjunkie boyfriends
out of jail?

34:13.717 --> 34:15.719
How many? Was it three, four times?

34:15.804 --> 34:18.139
I swear, Sara, it's funny, you know?

34:18.223 --> 34:21.393
You have no trouble whatsoever
with me bending the law,

34:21.476 --> 34:24.437
especially when it's bent in your direction.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.438
Grow up.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.531
PATTERSON: You talk to that Tweener kid?

34:34.614 --> 34:37.409
Yeah, he says he got his days mixed up,
but I don't know.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.995
- What?
- Just something about the way he said it.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.246
Oh, come on, man,
Bellick's just taking a personal.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.833
- I don't want to get the guy busted.
- And if he's not?

34:44.916 --> 34:48.670
I'm just saying, it's 6:30,
and no one's heard from the guy.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.964
We got to tell Pope.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.009
Okay. I'll tell him.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.640
VERONICA: Did you call
a cab for the airport?

35:00.724 --> 35:01.725
No, not yet.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.727
Why not?
Come on, the flight leaves in an hour.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.186
Yeah. Yeah.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.898
I'm starting to think
that us going to Montana

35:08.982 --> 35:10.191
might not be a good move.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.152
What are you talking about?

35:12.235 --> 35:14.529
What if you are right
and the smoking gun is in that house?

35:14.613 --> 35:16.239
You think they're just gonna
let us walk in there

35:16.323 --> 35:17.407
and make a citizen's arrest?

35:17.490 --> 35:19.242
Look, Nick,
I don't know what your deal is lately,

35:19.326 --> 35:22.537
but I'm getting on that plane
with or without you.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.500
I can't let you do that.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.723
All this time you were one of them?

35:43.183 --> 35:46.645
Who's pulling your leash, Nick?
Steadman? Kellerman?

35:47.687 --> 35:48.855
Look at me.

35:48.938 --> 35:50.231
I want you to remember my face

35:50.315 --> 35:53.652
when you do
whatever the hell it is you're gonna do.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.236
Look at me!

35:57.238 --> 35:58.865
You're a coward.

36:09.501 --> 36:12.003
- Scofield's outside, sir.
- Okay.

36:12.087 --> 36:15.215
I want you to try every number we have
for Brad Bellick.

36:15.298 --> 36:18.385
Try his home first.
His mother usually answers.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.934
Mrs. Bellick? Hi.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.396
One moment, please.
I have Warden Pope here for you.

36:29.479 --> 36:30.855
Mrs. Bellick?

36:30.939 --> 36:33.858
No cause for alarm, no, no. We just...
We haven't seen him,

36:33.942 --> 36:36.945
and we were wondering
if he might be home under the weather.

36:42.826 --> 36:46.079
So Brad called you
when he pulled in this morning?

36:46.162 --> 36:48.123
And he said he was here?

36:48.206 --> 36:50.375
Okay, well, thank you, Mrs. Bellick.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.294
We'll keep you posted. I'm sure he's fine.

36:53.795 --> 36:54.838
Radio Mack.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.132
Have him check the parking lot
for Bellick's truck.

36:57.215 --> 37:00.135
If he finds it,
have him call me immediately.

37:04.389 --> 37:05.557
457.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.809
This is base. What's your 20?

37:15.942 --> 37:19.028
MARICRUZ: I'm pregnant, Fernando.
I'm gonna have your son.

37:19.112 --> 37:21.948
But all I know is, is I'm really scared.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.701
I'm really scared to do this alone.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.668
MAN: John, it's never too late.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.129
If you'll agree
to accept Christ into your heart

37:36.212 --> 37:37.714
and turn from your sin,

37:37.797 --> 37:41.092
he will forgive you
and save you in eternity.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.846
I'll give you Fibonacci
when the time is right.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.139
The time is right now.

37:46.222 --> 37:49.350
No, the time is right when you and I
are both standing outside those walls.

38:06.242 --> 38:09.370
I'm gonna get out of here someday,
and when I do,

38:11.289 --> 38:15.168
don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.726
C-NOTE: I'm being shipped back off.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.246
How many times I got to say it?

38:51.329 --> 38:53.581
You only got one thing I need.

39:17.272 --> 39:19.607
<i>POPE: I've got some bad news, Charles.</i>

39:19.691 --> 39:21.943
<i>Your daughter's got esophageal cancer,</i>

39:22.026 --> 39:25.280
<i>and she wants to see you
while there's still time.</i>

39:25.780 --> 39:28.867
- How long does she have?
- Hospital says a week.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.634
(GASPING)

39:57.896 --> 39:59.188
(GROANING)

41:22.814 --> 41:25.108
<i>POPE: I read somewhere
where the actual Taj Mahal</i>

41:25.191 --> 41:28.027
<i>appears pink in the morning,
milky white in the evening</i>

41:28.111 --> 41:30.446
<i>and golden when the moon shines.</i>

41:31.030 --> 41:34.701
<i>The changes, they say,
depict the different emotions of a woman.</i>

41:34.951 --> 41:36.077
Well, I can tell you something,

41:36.160 --> 41:37.328
if we don't get this thing fixed tonight,

41:37.412 --> 41:39.664
I don't wanna know what kind of emotion
my wife is gonna have

41:39.747 --> 41:41.666
if I walk through that door empty-handed.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.334
It's strange. I mean, it just gave way.

41:43.418 --> 41:46.421
We lifted it up,
and the support beam snapped.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.758
- What's this?
- The support.

41:52.301 --> 41:54.679
And the one that holds up that beam.

41:55.263 --> 41:56.723
You took it?

41:58.933 --> 42:00.309
I'm sorry.

42:01.602 --> 42:04.063
But I needed to get back in here.

42:04.605 --> 42:08.151
- I don't understand. Why would you...
- I'm breaking out.

42:09.652 --> 42:12.947
And you're gonna make sure
my brother goes with me.
