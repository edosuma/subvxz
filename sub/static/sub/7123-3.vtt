Oh, hello there.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.003
Baybel Navel,
it's great to see you!

00:42.075 --> 00:44.009
Here for more graybles,
I reckon.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.203
Well, all right.

00:45.278 --> 00:49.237
Just like last time, we'll watch
five separate stories,

00:49.315 --> 00:52.443
each relating to one
special theme.

00:52.519 --> 00:55.647
Guess the theme by the end
of the episode

00:55.722 --> 00:58.714
and you'll be
the freshest mint-whistle.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.555
Now, look to my visualizer
screen

01:02.629 --> 01:05.029
and let this exciting grayble

01:05.098 --> 01:08.625
dribble all over your
mind-label.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.031
Okay, so...

01:15.108 --> 01:16.598
Scooch.

01:16.676 --> 01:18.166
Okay, so I'm still pretty sure

01:18.244 --> 01:21.008
this old book's some warlock's
spell book or something.

01:22.882 --> 01:23.746
Messed!

01:23.817 --> 01:25.307
Warlocks, dude.

01:25.385 --> 01:27.979
You ready for some ancient
feel-good spellcraft?

01:28.054 --> 01:28.986
Yeah, I'll try it.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.545
Could always stand
to feel better.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.989
Let's see...

01:33.059 --> 01:34.083
you got your bibby?

01:34.160 --> 01:35.149
Check it.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.761
Yep.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.528
Little Jack Horner
sat in the corner,

01:41.601 --> 01:44.035
eating a Christmas pie.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.938
He put in his thumb and pulled
out a plum and said,

01:48.007 --> 01:50.703
"what a good boy am I."

01:53.446 --> 01:55.004
I don't feel like a good boy.

01:55.081 --> 01:56.742
You sure you read
the spell right?

01:56.816 --> 01:57.680
Mmm. Yeah.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.580
Still, though... pretty sweet.

02:00.653 --> 02:03.121
Wanna keep sticking our thumbs
in stuff until it works?

02:03.189 --> 02:04.019

Oh, what a good boy...

02:23.576 --> 02:25.544
Do you feel like a good boy?

02:25.612 --> 02:27.136
No, I don't.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.511
Hey, check out that
gross toad!

02:31.651 --> 02:33.175
Oh, what a good boy am I.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.050
Gross. Cut it out.

02:35.121 --> 02:38.648
Quit sticking your thumbs
in my back.

Yeah, I don't know.

Excuse me sir, I wasn't
looking where I was...

04:04.744 --> 04:06.939
- Tree Trunks, up here!
- Oh, no!

04:07.013 --> 04:09.038
Heavens no!

04:09.115 --> 04:10.810
I'm glad you brought this matter

04:10.883 --> 04:12.874
to the authorities, ma'am.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.249
Now what exactly happened?

04:14.320 --> 04:16.185
Yes, thank you.

I-I heard a man calling out
to me "Oh, Tree Trunks."

04:20.627 --> 04:24.222
So I said "Who's calling?
I don't know."

04:24.297 --> 04:28.859
So I looked, and he was making
a rude gesture.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.699
It left a sour taste
in my mouth.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.035
All right, ma'am.
Let's see.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.041

- Hold on one second.

04:45.585 --> 04:46.745
Ugh, I'm sorry,

04:46.819 --> 04:49.310
but the wheels of justice
spin too slowly.

to take the law

The police have failed me
in my time of need,

05:01.134 --> 05:04.297
so I have brought you here
together.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.736
A posse.

05:06.806 --> 05:11.243
I made you all blackjacks
in case things get ugly.

05:11.311 --> 05:16.681
I stuffed some of my stockings
with balled-up newspapers.

05:16.749 --> 05:21.083
I made a big one for you because
you're so strong.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.849

08:21.567 --> 08:22.761
No, you must learn.

This is a grapefruit spoon.

08:26.639 --> 08:29.574
It's only for eating
grapefruits.

08:29.642 --> 08:33.635

almost every hole today.

09:32.038 --> 09:34.529

good boys.

So, did you guess the theme?

09:59.565 --> 10:01.556
Go ahead and pause

I can tell.

10:12.078 --> 10:13.409
That's right.

10:13.479 --> 10:17.347
The theme is
"The Five Tastes."

10:17.416 --> 10:21.614
You see, Jake ate
a <i>sweet</i> plum.

10:21.687 --> 10:26.215
Marceline played

10:32.298 --> 10:36.962
Gunther wanted to drink
the <i>salty</i> tears.

10:37.036 --> 10:40.665
And Football's tea
was <i>bitter.</i>

10:42.375 --> 10:44.935
Huh? What?
What's that you say?

10:45.011 --> 10:48.469
You thought the theme was
the "Five Fingers"?

10:50.116 --> 10:51.743
Don't be silly.
