WEBVTT

00:00.789 --> 00:02.566
Previously on "Manhattan"...

00:02.591 --> 00:04.107
What's the point in keeping my group alive

00:04.109 --> 00:05.343
if you're just gonna starve us to death?

00:05.345 --> 00:07.046
10 micrograms, that's all I'm asking.

00:07.048 --> 00:08.828
- It's nothing.
- That belongs to Robert Oppenheimer.

00:08.853 --> 00:10.317
We're building Akley's bomb.

00:10.319 --> 00:13.619
If Frank could prove that implosion
was more than a fairy tale,

00:13.621 --> 00:15.425
even at the most rudimentary level,

00:15.427 --> 00:17.202
I'll give him all the plutonium he wants.

00:17.227 --> 00:18.729
Fine, I'll prove it.

00:22.071 --> 00:24.309
The plutonium will remain
with Dr. Akley's group.

00:24.311 --> 00:27.115
You probably spent your whole
life surrounded by people

00:27.117 --> 00:29.917
who weren't smart enough to
recognize how smart you are.

00:29.919 --> 00:33.255
But I do. And you are a
once-in-a-generation mind.

00:33.257 --> 00:34.858
No, you can't go to school in New York.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.225
So I'm just supposed to stay
here in this prison camp?

00:37.227 --> 00:39.630
Why are we even here?

00:42.034 --> 00:43.907
No. No.

00:44.222 --> 00:47.392
Whatever it is, Frank, you can tell me.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:00.658 --> 01:03.627
Watch rotation is at 2200 hours.

01:03.629 --> 01:05.663
We can expect shelling again tonight,

01:05.665 --> 01:08.268
unless it's some kind of kraut holiday.

01:08.814 --> 01:10.240
Where's Fathead?

01:12.344 --> 01:13.911
Here, sir.

01:13.913 --> 01:17.416
Remind me, Fathead, how many years
of college you got under your belt?

01:18.263 --> 01:19.543
Two.

01:21.024 --> 01:22.859
You needn't brag, son.

01:22.861 --> 01:24.663
Those bona fides have qualified you

01:24.665 --> 01:26.769
for your very first intelligence mission.

01:26.771 --> 01:29.040
Tonight, you'll crawl out of this hole

01:29.042 --> 01:30.808
into no-man's-land

01:30.810 --> 01:32.979
and check dead krauts for documents.

01:34.649 --> 01:36.273
You're going, soldier.

01:37.659 --> 01:39.030
Yes, sir.

01:40.023 --> 01:42.223
Hey, you see any gold
teeth, pull 'em for me.

01:44.661 --> 01:46.595
And keep your head down, Fathead.

01:46.597 --> 01:49.415
Hey, what's your real name anyway
in case you don't make it back?

01:58.405 --> 02:00.578
Do you get chills at night?

02:00.875 --> 02:02.777
- No.
- Any headaches?

02:02.779 --> 02:04.977
Only bureaucratic.

02:05.927 --> 02:08.651
Headaches aren't the problem. Sleeping is.

02:08.652 --> 02:11.989
Insomnia isn't a diagnosis. It's a symptom.

02:13.590 --> 02:16.158
Do you often feel distant from the world

02:16.160 --> 02:18.637
- even when you're among friends?
- No.

02:18.662 --> 02:21.228
Do you ever feel hopeless
about the present or future?

02:24.266 --> 02:26.572
Is this a psychiatric evaluation?

02:27.059 --> 02:30.209
New rule. I'm required
to give it to all patients

02:30.211 --> 02:32.313
who are seeking psychoactive medication.

02:32.315 --> 02:34.549
Military patients. I'm a civilian.

02:34.906 --> 02:36.551
But you were military, right?

02:36.553 --> 02:39.041
Infantry, World War I.

02:39.066 --> 02:41.690
Volunteered just after your 18th birthday.

02:41.692 --> 02:44.026
-  You see any action?
- I saw...

02:44.028 --> 02:46.436
The inside of half the bars in France.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.903
I was ambulance service
around the same time.

02:50.416 --> 02:52.303
Maybe we drank in some of the same bars.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.106
Is this your screening or mine?

02:58.613 --> 03:01.715
Certain parties on The Hill have
raised questions, Dr. Winter,

03:01.717 --> 03:05.348
regarding your erratic behavior.

03:06.298 --> 03:07.656
Certain parties?

03:07.658 --> 03:10.726
There will be no more pills
without a full evaluation.

03:13.832 --> 03:16.607
You may not be in uniform anymore,

03:17.718 --> 03:20.037
but we both work for the US Army.

03:24.578 --> 03:27.182
What about Moros, the Greek God of Doom?

03:27.184 --> 03:29.783
Or Thanatos, his brother?

03:29.785 --> 03:31.954
The bringer of peaceful death.

03:31.956 --> 03:34.490
Or we could call it Dumbo
after the flying elephant.

03:34.492 --> 03:36.392
Well, it's not a he, it's a she.

03:36.394 --> 03:39.063
Bombs are female like airplanes or boats.

03:39.065 --> 03:41.122
Hmm, all things that go down.

03:42.634 --> 03:44.467
Oh, where are the primers?

03:44.469 --> 03:47.470
I had to submit the
requisition form three times.

03:47.472 --> 03:50.671
But lucky for you guys, the
clerk at the ordnance office

03:50.673 --> 03:52.907
is a fellow thespian in
the repertory company.

03:52.909 --> 03:54.908
You played the tin man, not Richard III.

03:54.910 --> 03:57.277
Well, we get one set of
primers to Akley's six.

03:57.279 --> 04:00.148
So don't spend them all in one place.

04:03.018 --> 04:05.785
Frank, you're bleeding.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.220
God damn it.

04:10.523 --> 04:12.457
We've got to get this thing done.

04:12.459 --> 04:15.145
I don't care if I'm on probation or not.

04:16.024 --> 04:18.459
Take those pliers. Secure that.

04:22.065 --> 04:23.716
I mean, he hardly eats.

04:24.066 --> 04:26.298
Talks more to himself than anyone else.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.901
My grandmother would say he
bears the stench of madness.

04:28.903 --> 04:29.921
Thank you.

04:31.436 --> 04:33.540
And what would her grandson say?

04:33.542 --> 04:36.077
May I speak freely?

04:36.079 --> 04:38.447
I don't know who Frank
Winter is at war with,

04:38.449 --> 04:41.182
the axis or himself.

04:41.597 --> 04:42.663
Or you.

04:44.253 --> 04:46.153
And you've come to tell
me this why exactly?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.661
I'm better suited for work on Thin Man.

04:51.462 --> 04:53.431
I got the highest first
of my year at Oxford.

04:53.433 --> 04:55.399
I'm meticulous. I'm extremely diligent.

04:55.401 --> 04:57.167
And loyal?

04:58.469 --> 05:00.170
Rats flee a sinking ship.

05:00.172 --> 05:02.340
Respectfully, passengers also flee.

05:02.890 --> 05:04.981
As well as valuable crew.

05:05.713 --> 05:08.146
To a worthy captain, I'm loyal to the end.

05:10.182 --> 05:13.454
I knew Frank Winter since before
the world knew what a neutron was.

05:13.963 --> 05:16.663
No one doubts his
dedication to this project.

05:18.793 --> 05:21.765
However, between the two of us,

05:21.767 --> 05:24.998
questions have been raised about
his ability to lead a group.

05:28.001 --> 05:29.903
Maybe you and I can help each other.

05:38.717 --> 05:40.782
I ran a study in college.

05:40.784 --> 05:43.449
Sleep deprivation in brown rats.

05:43.957 --> 05:46.491
Two weeks in, they looked better than you.

05:47.057 --> 05:48.961
Three weeks in, they were dead.

05:48.963 --> 05:50.665
I'm fine.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.300
Yeah, that's why you're walking around

05:52.302 --> 05:54.801
with the wounds of Christ. Go home.

05:54.803 --> 05:58.344
- Get six good hours.
- We need to get out to the range.

05:58.842 --> 06:00.875
We finally got those primers.

06:00.877 --> 06:03.275
When the test works,
we'll get some plutonium.

06:03.277 --> 06:04.678
You're in the penalty box.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.082
You can't take a leak
without army supervision.

06:07.084 --> 06:10.050
We'll test it next week as scheduled.

07:30.546 --> 07:33.146
Manhattan 1x04
Last Reasoning of Kings

07:33.510 --> 07:37.504
Sync and corrections by Albanda
www.Addic7ed.com

07:44.902 --> 07:47.068
His time is limited.

07:47.070 --> 07:49.372
No questions. No digressions.

07:49.374 --> 07:51.108
No jokes.

07:59.553 --> 08:02.088
It's such an honor to
finally meet you, sir.

08:16.030 --> 08:18.130
Ahem.

08:18.927 --> 08:20.905
I'm pulling you from Thin Man.

08:23.101 --> 08:24.767
I don't know what you've heard,

08:24.769 --> 08:28.171
but Dr. Akley's been very
satisfied with my work.

08:28.173 --> 08:29.975
Reed Akley suggested it.

08:30.073 --> 08:32.807
You'll be attending to our new
arrival until further notice.

08:32.808 --> 08:33.908
Sir?

08:33.909 --> 08:35.691
We don't want him straying.

08:36.179 --> 08:38.542
You'll keep him on the straight and narrow

08:38.544 --> 08:41.607
and show him only our
finest work, understand?

08:41.610 --> 08:43.042
Dr. Oppenheimer...

08:43.044 --> 08:46.647
As iron sharpens iron, so
one man sharpens another.

08:48.249 --> 08:49.747
Is that Knute Rockne?

08:51.413 --> 08:52.911
Proverbs.

08:53.615 --> 08:57.082
Akley believes you are iron enough
to keep our colleague on point.

08:57.217 --> 08:58.811
I hope he's right.

09:11.399 --> 09:13.623
These are your instructions.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.737
You'll follow them to the letter

09:15.739 --> 09:17.373
as you escort him around The Hill.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.175
I'm sorry, who is him?

09:20.912 --> 09:23.148
Niels Bohr! We got Niels Bohr!

09:23.150 --> 09:26.112
Yeah, old news. Allies smuggled
him out of Denmark weeks ago.

09:26.114 --> 09:28.846
No, here, now. There's a
welcoming committee right outside.

09:28.848 --> 09:31.351
- The Niels Bohr?
- He must be here to work on Thin Man.

09:31.353 --> 09:34.220
Bohr unlocked the fundamental
secrets of all matter in the universe.

09:34.222 --> 09:35.821
He's a God. God doesn't
work for Reed Akley.

09:35.823 --> 09:37.257
He's a friend of yours, right?

09:37.259 --> 09:39.658
You said you worked with him
on your semester at Copenhagen.

09:40.585 --> 09:43.905
Yeah. We developed a mutual respect.

09:44.195 --> 09:45.500
Paul.

09:45.770 --> 09:47.962
Pack the camera. We're
driving out to the site.

09:47.964 --> 09:48.975
Test is next week.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.761
Well, we're scouting the terrain this week.

09:50.763 --> 09:53.374
It's a square mile of dust in
the middle of a desert wasteland.

09:53.399 --> 09:54.734
- What is there to scout?
- Frank,

09:54.759 --> 09:57.168
did you hear Niels Bohr is on The Hill?

09:57.170 --> 09:58.634
Well, unless he brought
articles of surrender

09:58.636 --> 10:00.235
signed by Hitler and Hirohito,

10:00.237 --> 10:02.404
it's still a workday.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.776
Look at Oppenheimer. It's his
third cigarette in 10 minutes.

10:09.778 --> 10:12.616
They should give him a
blindfold to go with it.

10:12.618 --> 10:15.754
God doesn't work for
Robert Oppenheimer either.

10:15.756 --> 10:18.154
Do you think he's here
to replace Oppenheimer?

10:19.790 --> 10:21.358
I was told he'd arrived.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.028
Well, his car came through
the main gate 10 minutes ago.

10:24.030 --> 10:26.263
The man reinvented physics

10:26.265 --> 10:29.615
and nearly died in a
rowboat escaping the Gestapo.

10:30.103 --> 10:33.223
Shall we allow him the
benefit of a toilet stop?

10:33.485 --> 10:37.042
Bohr will probably reorganize
the tech area, soup to nuts.

10:37.283 --> 10:39.148
Are we the soup or the nuts?

10:39.150 --> 10:40.749
That's the problem around here.

10:40.751 --> 10:42.050
They don't tell you what you are.

10:42.052 --> 10:43.418
They barely tell you
what you're working on.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.412
They didn't even tell
us that Bohr was coming.

10:47.719 --> 10:49.288
Here we go.

11:03.879 --> 11:05.476
He insisted on walking.

11:11.084 --> 11:14.886
So I pass out somewhere
over occupied Norway

11:14.888 --> 11:17.187
and awoke in Great Britain

11:17.189 --> 11:19.693
with the worst hangover of my life.

11:22.730 --> 11:24.329
Mm-mmm.

11:24.865 --> 11:27.569
It's bad luck to allow
another man to light your pipe.

11:27.571 --> 11:30.575
Oh, sorry. Charlie Isaacs, sir.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.035
- You're a hard man to find.
- Isaacs, yeah.

11:33.378 --> 11:35.775
You are the valet Bobby spoke of.

11:37.357 --> 11:40.382
No, I'll be showing you around campus.

11:41.484 --> 11:43.454
Fellas, excuse us.

11:45.592 --> 11:47.727
So, um...

11:47.729 --> 11:50.659
I worked with Everett at Harvard.

11:50.661 --> 11:52.626
For my thesis on cosmology,

11:52.628 --> 11:54.495
I actually used your
calculations of atomic nuclei...

11:54.497 --> 11:56.463
A kestrel.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.264
With a hood on.

11:58.266 --> 11:59.783
Wonderful.

12:04.074 --> 12:05.957
Sir, um...

12:06.664 --> 12:08.061
Hmm.

12:11.813 --> 12:13.382
Colonel Cox's office.

12:14.969 --> 12:17.171
Wait, which gate?

12:20.359 --> 12:23.432
All personnel must stop
at the main gate checkpoint

12:23.434 --> 12:26.000
for identification passes
whenever leaving from

12:26.002 --> 12:28.784
or arriving to Los Alamos.

12:29.506 --> 12:31.546
Pull over, private.

12:33.812 --> 12:35.784
Frank Winter.

12:35.809 --> 12:37.209
It's been an age.

12:37.234 --> 12:38.717
Good that you came, Niels.

12:38.742 --> 12:40.442
Better that you made it out of Europe.

12:40.467 --> 12:43.634
I was just citing your
axial chemistry study.

12:44.317 --> 12:47.205
So this is the famous Skinny Man?

12:47.528 --> 12:49.596
No, this is...

12:49.598 --> 12:51.143
This is another model.

12:51.566 --> 12:53.433
You'll know Thin Man when you see it.

12:53.435 --> 12:56.039
Believe me, a parade float, marching band,

12:56.041 --> 12:57.773
Akley and Oppie high in the saddle.

12:57.775 --> 13:01.613
Strapped on the backs of
their biographers, no doubt.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.781
After all you've been
through, Niels... Jesus.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.583
Seems like you got here
in one piece at least.

13:07.585 --> 13:10.556
Dr. Bohr, you and I have important
business at the Thin Man office.

13:10.558 --> 13:12.473
Yeah, just a moment, Christopher.

13:12.528 --> 13:14.394
Good to see you, Frank.

13:15.184 --> 13:16.662
Good to see you, Niels.

13:25.974 --> 13:28.106
Welcome to Manhattan.

13:31.974 --> 13:34.441
Christ, it's been 15 minutes.

13:34.443 --> 13:35.808
Where the hell is the colonel?

13:35.810 --> 13:38.376
PFC Dunlavey. I was told
there was an emergency.

13:38.378 --> 13:40.880
I get a private first class

13:40.882 --> 13:42.684
instead of a full bird
for a breach at the gate?

13:42.686 --> 13:45.487
The colonel is indisposed.
I'm the advance guard.

13:47.292 --> 13:49.260
Shit. Dunlavey.

13:49.951 --> 13:51.531
You're the guy.

13:51.533 --> 13:53.131
Annie Oakley.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.066
I heard you shot your way
into a plum assignment.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.952
This way.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.939
She tried to escape in
a truck full of Indians.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.974
Must have slipped them some wampum.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.545
She?

14:08.353 --> 14:10.652
Are you sure you brought enough guys?

14:21.397 --> 14:23.531
Righto, camera housing looks to fit.

14:23.533 --> 14:24.666
Should be in shipshape next week.

14:24.668 --> 14:26.234
Lock it down.

14:26.919 --> 14:28.573
Really? You want to test the bolts?

14:28.575 --> 14:31.945
I see nuts, I see threads.
I predict a happy union.

14:31.947 --> 14:33.352
Lock it down.

14:34.647 --> 14:36.311
Oh, Christ. You didn't.

14:36.313 --> 14:38.445
Frank. Frank.

14:38.447 --> 14:40.782
Frank, we cannot detonate
without an ordnance expert.

14:40.784 --> 14:42.149
We don't even have a fire extinguisher.

14:42.151 --> 14:43.752
Just worry about the camera.

14:43.754 --> 14:45.389
Are those detonators?

14:45.391 --> 14:49.024
We do not have clearance to
transport or discharge explosives.

14:49.026 --> 14:51.658
You need the division
chief's direct approval.

14:51.660 --> 14:53.362
I'll take full responsibility.

14:53.364 --> 14:56.364
You can't take responsibility.
It doesn't work that way.

14:56.366 --> 14:58.566
Your jeep is in the blast zone.

14:58.568 --> 15:00.750
I'd back it up a bit.

15:02.137 --> 15:03.869
I will have to write you up.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.474
I will have to write him up.

15:07.476 --> 15:09.609
Day is but young. I'd save your ink.

15:12.144 --> 15:14.913
Do try not to blow up all to kingdom come.

15:20.573 --> 15:22.881
_

15:25.525 --> 15:27.893
Did you really think you were
gonna sneak past the gate?

15:28.114 --> 15:29.991
You don't exactly look
like the day laborers.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.450
Well, my family was
killed in an apache raid.

15:33.017 --> 15:36.733
The San Ildefonso found me
and raised me as their own.

15:36.758 --> 15:38.924
Yeah, what'd they call you, Heaping Bull?

15:41.823 --> 15:43.922
You probably love it here.

15:45.479 --> 15:47.014
Let me guess,

15:47.016 --> 15:48.850
small-town boy.

15:50.154 --> 15:52.153
Army was your ticket to see the world.

15:55.023 --> 15:56.990
Something like that, yeah.

15:57.427 --> 15:59.961
Your small town have a
barbed wire fence around it?

15:59.963 --> 16:01.829
We didn't even have a traffic light.

16:03.207 --> 16:06.075
You come from good people. You'll
get a chance to see the world.

16:06.326 --> 16:07.858
All you got to do is wait.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.705
It's private Dunlavey, right?

16:13.260 --> 16:15.595
Don't pretend you know anything about me

16:15.620 --> 16:18.488
just because you put a bullet
through my dad's mathematician.

16:23.658 --> 16:25.192
All right, the camera.

16:26.411 --> 16:27.811
You didn't turn it on?

16:27.915 --> 16:29.380
It doesn't go on until we're hot,

16:29.952 --> 16:31.715
and now we're hot.

16:33.316 --> 16:34.888
Without the film, the test is pointless.

16:34.890 --> 16:37.523
I know. I know.

16:37.525 --> 16:39.824
Oh, Jesus, if you don't want
to scuff up your wing tips,

16:39.826 --> 16:41.356
I'm happy to do your job for you.

16:52.997 --> 16:54.798
Bloody hell.

17:09.990 --> 17:14.874
All right. Three, two, one.

17:17.808 --> 17:19.301
What happened?

17:20.044 --> 17:22.810
I don't know. I must have missed something.

17:22.811 --> 17:24.875
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go turn off the camera.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.542
You wait 30 minutes before
approaching a failed detonation.

17:27.545 --> 17:29.209
Not five seconds!

17:42.892 --> 17:45.526
Frank! Frank, are you all right?

17:45.528 --> 17:47.032
Frank, can you hear me?

17:47.591 --> 17:48.730
Frank!

17:50.399 --> 17:52.240
How's the camera?

18:01.915 --> 18:04.483
- Abby.
- Fay. Dot. Gladys.

18:04.485 --> 18:06.853
We were in the neighborhood,
so we thought we'd say hello.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.229
Hope we're interrupting something.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.786
No, of course not.

18:11.692 --> 18:13.086
Oh.

18:13.111 --> 18:15.379
Uh, hello.

18:20.286 --> 18:22.186
No, no, no. First you shape the nails,

18:22.211 --> 18:23.910
then you soak or they get too soft.

18:24.171 --> 18:27.172
Shape, then soak.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.440
Understand?

18:28.817 --> 18:31.753
10,000 years in this country and
they still don't speak the language.

18:31.982 --> 18:34.848
We were just saying how
we never see you, Abby.

18:34.850 --> 18:36.117
Oh, I really shouldn't.

18:36.119 --> 18:38.299
The men work 80 hours a week.

18:38.324 --> 18:41.492
We work 30 and drink the other 50.

18:41.781 --> 18:43.215
Math 101.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.041
On the subject of math, they're pulling out

18:45.066 --> 18:47.465
all the stops for Dr.
Bohr's welcoming dinner.

18:47.734 --> 18:50.580
You should see the menu. Antelope tartare.

18:50.605 --> 18:52.371
And, of course, our
husbands will be too busy

18:52.396 --> 18:55.096
performing fellatio on their
new boss to eat anything.

18:55.121 --> 18:56.686
I don't think we're invited.

18:56.788 --> 18:59.822
Please, with Charlie as Dr.
Bohr's new right-hand man,

18:59.981 --> 19:02.014
you've got to be one
of the guests of honor.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.748
The rumor is true, isn't it?

19:03.750 --> 19:06.115
I heard they're practically inseparable.

19:08.615 --> 19:12.181
Well, Dr. Bohr doesn't go anywhere
on The Hill without Charlie.

19:14.985 --> 19:16.415
Cheers.

19:18.343 --> 19:19.944
You ready to meet the gadget?

19:37.102 --> 19:39.505
Would you ask these engineers to leave?

19:39.530 --> 19:42.344
Sir, they've prepared a detailed
presentation on Thin Man.

19:42.346 --> 19:44.866
After my dance with the Nazis,

19:45.582 --> 19:48.884
I don't relish the exuberance of crowds.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.792
Not getting fuel to the carburetor.

19:56.794 --> 19:58.660
There's probably sand in the filter.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.572
So we're stuck here until they send help?

20:02.597 --> 20:04.698
I won't be missed until bed check.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.466
There's no one waiting for me.

20:06.468 --> 20:08.368
How long till Mrs. Winter raises a fuss?

20:08.643 --> 20:09.943
I don't know, two, three days.

20:12.107 --> 20:14.274
We're about 30 miles from home.

20:14.276 --> 20:16.410
If we start now, we'll
make it back before dawn.

20:16.412 --> 20:18.144
You want to walk back?

20:18.146 --> 20:20.713
If we sit here, the camera
will overheat, ruin the film.

20:20.715 --> 20:23.515
Orders are to remain with
a nonoperating vehicle

20:23.517 --> 20:25.317
until otherwise instructed.

20:25.319 --> 20:28.317
With no more primers, it'll be
weeks before we can run another test.

20:28.319 --> 20:30.987
I'm not losing the film.
So you get the camera.

20:31.555 --> 20:34.291
We'll hit cooler temperatures
as we climb the hill.

20:35.312 --> 20:36.393
No.

20:36.395 --> 20:38.428
No one's going anywhere.

20:41.299 --> 20:43.171
Get the camera.

20:44.337 --> 20:45.938
Now.

20:49.443 --> 20:51.377
I'm transferring to Thin Man.

20:53.013 --> 20:54.547
I'm joining Akley's group.

20:56.617 --> 20:58.518
You know, when we get home,

20:58.520 --> 21:01.356
you can transfer to
the axis for all I care.

21:01.358 --> 21:03.526
But I brought you onto this project,

21:03.528 --> 21:06.530
and for the next 30 miles, I
can kick your ass off of it.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.070
So you pick up that damn camera.

21:15.979 --> 21:18.685
No. No one is leaving this test site.

21:18.687 --> 21:20.360
I'm in charge.

21:20.923 --> 21:24.090
Oh, Jesus. I don't feel like
getting shot in the back.

21:24.092 --> 21:26.259
So if you're planning on using that,

21:27.056 --> 21:28.730
go ahead.

21:30.401 --> 21:31.955
Don't look at me to talk you out of it.

21:51.824 --> 21:54.824
The last reasoning of kings.

21:55.946 --> 21:57.225
I'm sorry?

21:58.761 --> 22:00.196
Louis XIV.

22:00.198 --> 22:02.565
He had that stamped on his cannon.

22:02.567 --> 22:04.110
It is a cannon.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.165
Firing in on itself.

22:06.167 --> 22:08.935
Won't spontaneous neutrons
predetonate your fuel?

22:08.937 --> 22:13.302
Not so long as you fire the
slugs at 3,170 feet per second.

22:13.609 --> 22:15.340
Who deduced that?

22:15.365 --> 22:17.866
Charlie did, actually.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.608
Charlie Isaacs, report to the switchboard.

22:22.610 --> 22:24.677
Emergency call for Charlie Isaacs.

22:24.679 --> 22:26.346
Go, I'll take over.

22:35.387 --> 22:37.957
Abby, hi. Thought you went home.

22:41.328 --> 22:44.423
Charlie Isaacs, report to me.

22:45.369 --> 22:47.863
Abby, I have to get back.

22:47.865 --> 22:49.490
Now isn't...

22:51.422 --> 22:52.697
Where is everyone?

22:52.722 --> 22:54.838
They're all at lunch. We have five minutes.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.221
Dr. Bohr is waiting.

23:03.361 --> 23:04.828
What has gotten into you?

23:04.853 --> 23:06.120
They were hanging on every word.

23:06.145 --> 23:08.644
The ladies' auxiliary. Tell me about Bohr.

23:08.827 --> 23:10.859
The details. Where he's living,

23:10.861 --> 23:12.061
what he's gonna be working on.

23:12.063 --> 23:13.562
You know I can't talk about work.

23:13.564 --> 23:15.431
Just give me some meat
to throw to the wolves.

23:22.710 --> 23:24.413
Um...

23:24.647 --> 23:28.015
He's got a theory on electron motion.

23:28.017 --> 23:30.617
- Electron motion.
- Involving Planck's constant.

23:30.619 --> 23:32.753
Planck's constant.

23:32.755 --> 23:34.722
And the Thomas rotation.

23:34.724 --> 23:37.324
Oh, God. The Thomas rotation.

23:46.806 --> 23:48.940
How about you lug this for a while?

23:49.365 --> 23:50.927
Not my job.

23:50.952 --> 23:52.719
Beneath your station, is it?

23:52.744 --> 23:54.166
A private in a motor pool.

23:54.205 --> 23:56.672
Yeah, in a week, I'll be
shipping off to the Pacific.

23:56.674 --> 23:58.739
That means I'm done
chaperoning the pencil necks

23:58.741 --> 24:00.041
I beat up in grade school.

24:00.043 --> 24:01.342
Oh, brilliant. You'll be graduating

24:01.344 --> 24:02.980
from taxi driver to cannon fodder.

24:02.982 --> 24:05.684
Yeah, well, at least I'll be
making a difference in this fight.

24:05.686 --> 24:08.484
You think a single soldier makes a
whit of difference in a world war?

24:08.486 --> 24:10.051
More than a guy like you.

24:10.076 --> 24:13.041
Who do you think invented that
gun you've been relieved of? Huh?

24:13.353 --> 24:16.799
Or dynamite, radar, submarine, tanks?

24:17.165 --> 24:19.092
If it weren't for guys
like me, chaps like you

24:19.094 --> 24:21.463
would still be poking each other
to death with sharpened sticks.

24:21.465 --> 24:23.805
Both of you shut up.

24:24.732 --> 24:26.954
He always been such a barrel of monkeys?

24:28.040 --> 24:29.779
Barrel of what?

24:30.343 --> 24:31.655
Really?

24:32.043 --> 24:34.243
Seems to be a common
complaint in your household.

24:34.245 --> 24:37.212
It's a common complaint at high elevations.

24:37.214 --> 24:39.214
Thin air lowers oxygen levels in the blood,

24:39.216 --> 24:41.083
causing cerebral hypoxia.

24:41.085 --> 24:43.555
The body typically adapts within a week.

24:43.929 --> 24:45.805
Guess I'm a slow learner.

24:46.059 --> 24:49.995
So the fact that your husband
tried to fill a prescription

24:49.997 --> 24:53.566
for a sleep aid just
yesterday, that's a coincidence?

24:53.568 --> 24:55.230
You tell me, doctor.

24:55.604 --> 24:57.638
Is insomnia contagious?

24:59.608 --> 25:01.509
Before I write you a script,
you're going to have to answer

25:01.511 --> 25:03.713
some questions from the
army's mental fitness survey.

25:05.350 --> 25:07.617
Do you ever feel distant from the world

25:07.619 --> 25:08.819
even when you're among friends?

25:08.821 --> 25:10.887
My nearest friend is 1,200 miles away.

25:10.889 --> 25:12.254
I'd call that distant.

25:12.256 --> 25:15.157
Do you ever feel hopeless
about the present or the future?

25:15.602 --> 25:19.037
There are 74 sovereign states in the world.

25:19.232 --> 25:22.163
61 one of them are at war. How do you feel?

25:22.165 --> 25:24.367
And what about your present and future?

25:24.369 --> 25:28.005
I feel hopeful that I will return
to real life when all this is over.

25:28.007 --> 25:29.644
This isn't real life?

25:34.476 --> 25:39.143
I walked away from a tenure-track
lectureship in the Ivy league.

25:39.145 --> 25:42.414
My husband's research is of
vital interest to the government,

25:42.416 --> 25:44.080
mine is expendable.

25:46.184 --> 25:48.739
The army won't let me work here.

25:49.056 --> 25:50.989
They haven't told me why.

25:52.525 --> 25:54.458
My marriage is in limbo.

25:54.460 --> 25:58.131
My daughter is trying
to get herself killed.

25:58.133 --> 25:59.689
She may just succeed.

26:01.570 --> 26:04.875
I wake up in the morning and
I barely recognize the woman

26:04.877 --> 26:07.247
I see looking back at me in the mirror.

26:12.823 --> 26:14.185
I'm sorry.

26:14.410 --> 26:15.950
What was the question?

26:30.876 --> 26:33.739
Make sure he doesn't
take them with alcohol.

26:34.445 --> 26:38.042
The metallurgy and chemistry teams
want to show you some tampers.

26:38.044 --> 26:41.411
Frank Winter's office is
in this direction, correct?

26:41.413 --> 26:43.211
Implosion isn't really part of the tour.

26:43.213 --> 26:45.684
It's more of a backup
plan. Dr. Bohr, we really...

26:45.686 --> 26:47.391
It's just a backup plan.

26:48.888 --> 26:52.490
Maybe we'll all be folded into
one group working under Dr. Bohr.

26:52.492 --> 26:55.591
Holy moly. God's on his way to our office.

26:55.593 --> 26:56.783
Where's Frank?

26:56.783 --> 26:59.063
Someone's got to walk him through our work.

26:59.065 --> 27:01.233
How do I look? Glasses or no glasses?

27:01.235 --> 27:03.868
I'm the only one with a PhD.
It should be me. I outrank you.

27:03.870 --> 27:05.503
No, it should be Fritz. He knows him.

27:08.103 --> 27:11.542
Dr. Nohr. Noctor Door. Niels.

27:16.279 --> 27:18.583
I just wanted to say

27:18.585 --> 27:21.488
I still think about that
time we spent together.

27:23.089 --> 27:26.291
So many universes, aren't there?

27:28.939 --> 27:31.639
Dr. Bohr would like me to walk
him through the implosion design.

27:31.696 --> 27:33.999
- You?
- Sir.

27:39.532 --> 27:41.202
Jesus.

27:42.738 --> 27:46.174
The geometry, it's like
a star swallowing itself.

27:46.176 --> 27:47.643
It's impressive.

27:49.981 --> 27:52.415
But do you think it is big enough?

27:52.737 --> 27:54.137
Big enough?

28:02.793 --> 28:05.097
Hate to cut the tour short, Niels,

28:05.099 --> 28:06.799
but would you join me in my office?

28:06.801 --> 28:08.734
Of course, Bobby.

28:15.580 --> 28:17.881
Did you not understand your instructions?

28:17.883 --> 28:20.551
He insisted on seeing the
implosion group's work, sir.

28:20.553 --> 28:23.125
- I tried to stop...
- Your services are no longer needed.

28:29.664 --> 28:31.698
General George Patton whupped the ass

28:31.700 --> 28:34.820
of 200,000 Italian soldiers.

28:35.635 --> 28:39.002
Now, you really think a scientist
could have pulled that off?

28:40.870 --> 28:42.402
He got to Europe in an airplane

28:42.608 --> 28:46.809
based on principles designed
by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738.

28:46.811 --> 28:48.402
If it weren't for scientists,

28:48.511 --> 28:50.916
Patton couldn't even have
paddled to Italy in a canoe

28:50.918 --> 28:53.725
because he wouldn't have
understood the laws of buoyancy.

28:54.019 --> 28:57.318
So you think you need a PhD to float?

29:00.358 --> 29:02.125
How much water have you got left?

29:04.094 --> 29:05.596
Half a canteen.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.538
Don't put your limey
lips all over the nozzle.

29:12.942 --> 29:15.411
- Hold the camera.
- Oh, no sale, brother.

29:15.413 --> 29:18.048
You're just trying to trick me
into carrying your load for you.

29:18.050 --> 29:19.482
Just hold it a minute.

29:20.787 --> 29:22.821
You bloody idiot!

29:27.461 --> 29:29.727
- That is not my fault.
- Hey, don't look at me.

29:29.729 --> 29:32.729
Damn it, you exposed the
film. You had one simple job.

29:32.731 --> 29:35.398
I am an Oxford-educated
physicist. I'm not a bellboy.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.400
The camera broke because you
insisted on performing an illegal test

29:38.402 --> 29:40.407
when we could have easily waited a week.

29:41.070 --> 29:43.450
I'm not walking anymore.

29:43.743 --> 29:45.572
When they come and rescue us,

29:45.597 --> 29:46.977
I'll see to it that they know the truth.

29:46.979 --> 29:48.444
You're not fit for leadership.

29:48.446 --> 29:51.056
You're fit for a straightjacket
and a padded cell.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.784
No one's coming to save us.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.406
It'll be dark soon.

29:59.757 --> 30:02.846
If we get separated,
just stick to the road.

30:04.715 --> 30:06.916
You can at least leave me my gun.

30:07.230 --> 30:08.730
If I give it back to you,

30:08.732 --> 30:10.932
you'll be thrown in the
brig for violating orders.

30:10.934 --> 30:14.132
If I keep it, you can just
say I forced you at gunpoint.

30:26.181 --> 30:28.419
There's Cary Grant.

30:28.421 --> 30:30.156
You need to get dressed.

30:30.158 --> 30:31.882
We're not going to the Bohr dinner.

30:32.362 --> 30:35.196
Stick to physics. You
have no future in comedy.

30:35.198 --> 30:38.100
Yeah, well, we might not
have one on this hill, either.

30:40.736 --> 30:43.035
What happened?

30:46.307 --> 30:48.208
Dr. Oppenheimer...

30:50.179 --> 30:52.208
He thinks I overstepped him.

30:52.484 --> 30:55.784
Christ, Akley must be
distancing himself as we speak.

30:55.786 --> 30:59.170
I'll probably end up in Frank Winter's
group with those other rejects.

31:04.528 --> 31:07.366
You know, my father wanted me to marry

31:07.368 --> 31:09.602
someone from east Egg, not east St. Louis.

31:09.604 --> 31:12.671
And I told him "I don't
care. Charlie's a genius."

31:14.107 --> 31:16.575
The truth is, I don't
think you are a genius.

31:19.726 --> 31:22.328
I didn't know what you
were until we got here...

31:23.772 --> 31:27.142
And I saw the way people everyone
else calls geniuses look at you.

31:32.930 --> 31:34.828
Forget Oppenheimer.

31:35.369 --> 31:37.778
Forget Akley. They're yesterday.

31:38.523 --> 31:40.038
And we are going to that party

31:40.040 --> 31:41.472
and we're gonna fix everything with the man

31:41.474 --> 31:43.440
who'll be running this place tomorrow.

31:45.875 --> 31:48.876
Hmm? We're going.

31:48.878 --> 31:50.877
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

33:31.112 --> 33:33.749
War's brought all other
research to a grinding halt.

33:33.751 --> 33:36.052
I mean, the progress on
stellar spectroscopy alone is...

33:36.054 --> 33:38.686
Well, the good news is the stars
don't seem to be going anywhere.

33:38.688 --> 33:41.420
Something lost, something gained.

33:41.422 --> 33:43.758
Just look at the wonderful
discoveries you've been making

33:43.760 --> 33:45.306
- in plutonium fiss...
- Ahem!

33:47.798 --> 33:51.229
You must belong to the late Frank Winter.

33:51.761 --> 33:54.671
Well, I suppose he is not on time.

33:55.572 --> 33:58.673
Niels, tell us about the mood in London.

33:58.675 --> 34:01.277
I'm going to investigate
the mood at the bar.

34:01.279 --> 34:02.611
Excuse me.

34:02.613 --> 34:04.847
And I will accompany you.

34:09.405 --> 34:14.010
So, tell me, what have you been working on?

34:14.324 --> 34:16.922
Oh, I don't work.

34:16.925 --> 34:18.357
Then you are the second wife.

34:18.359 --> 34:19.993
First and only, I'm afraid.

34:19.995 --> 34:22.545
But Frank is married to
a brilliant scientist.

34:23.304 --> 34:24.964
Who told you that?

34:24.966 --> 34:29.199
I saw your husband after
the swedes gave me my medal

34:29.202 --> 34:32.402
and I told him that he would
have one of his own before long.

34:32.405 --> 34:34.607
And he said, "the only way

34:34.609 --> 34:37.212
I will be invited to the Nobel ceremony

34:37.214 --> 34:40.717
is as my wife's dinner companion."

34:44.554 --> 34:46.222
Who says I'd bring him?

34:46.224 --> 34:48.158
Do I remember correctly,

34:48.159 --> 34:50.757
you are a biologist?

34:50.759 --> 34:52.261
Botanist.

34:52.263 --> 34:54.599
Fertilization and pollination of monocots.

34:54.601 --> 34:56.934
The sex lives of flowers.

34:57.609 --> 35:00.104
Here, I'm just a physicist's wife.

35:00.106 --> 35:01.620
Where I've come from,

35:02.142 --> 35:05.844
too many great minds have been
forced to abandon their work.

35:06.306 --> 35:09.508
What a pity it would be to lose another.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.179
Dr. Bohr, a moment?

35:12.181 --> 35:15.815
Flowers bloom everywhere, Dr. Winter.

35:16.791 --> 35:18.418
Even in the desert.

36:23.152 --> 36:25.118
I'm not walking 'cause you told me to.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.253
I'm walking so we don't freeze to death.

36:27.255 --> 36:29.355
Can you help me get this off?

36:40.031 --> 36:41.499
Ah! No!

36:42.351 --> 36:43.735
Careful.

36:44.937 --> 36:47.038
Is that shrapnel?

36:51.881 --> 36:53.558
Oh, dear God.

36:54.284 --> 36:56.083
I've got a first aid kit.

37:12.597 --> 37:14.531
Why are you here, Paul?

37:15.665 --> 37:18.605
Lost in the desert tending
to the wounds of a madman?

37:18.607 --> 37:20.975
War's raging in your own backyard.

37:20.977 --> 37:24.176
You plant yourself 5,000
miles away. Why are you here?

37:24.178 --> 37:26.646
Same reason as you. I'm a physicist.

37:26.648 --> 37:29.816
There hasn't been a greater collection of
scientific minds since classical Athens.

37:29.818 --> 37:31.951
No, no, no. Why are you here?

37:31.953 --> 37:33.988
- Stop saying that.
- 'Cause you have a gift.

37:35.659 --> 37:37.442
You want to put it to actual use.

37:43.230 --> 37:45.830
Tell Akley whatever you want about me.

37:45.832 --> 37:47.978
He's the crazy one, you know.

37:48.167 --> 37:50.768
That man keeps banker's hours.

37:51.427 --> 37:53.904
Home every night in time
for his predinner Brandy

37:53.906 --> 37:55.471
followed by a quiet meal with his wife.

37:55.473 --> 37:57.222
A cigar by the fire.

37:57.774 --> 37:59.172
A long winter's nap.

37:59.174 --> 38:01.106
Sounds civilized to me.

38:01.757 --> 38:04.278
Punching a clock during wartime,

38:04.803 --> 38:06.603
that's not crazy to you?

38:10.415 --> 38:13.144
Whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

38:13.169 --> 38:16.320
What you're feeling now, that urge to run

38:16.595 --> 38:18.360
or dig yourself a safe hole in the ground,

38:18.362 --> 38:19.928
that's every second on the front lines.

38:19.930 --> 38:22.502
There's no comfort in battle.

38:22.504 --> 38:24.636
There's no brandy. There's no lunch breaks.

38:24.661 --> 38:27.106
There's no trips to the picture show.

38:27.108 --> 38:29.642
In this war, scientists are soldiers.

38:36.949 --> 38:39.487
There's no secret brain
trust in Washington.

38:39.489 --> 38:41.256
No classified peace plan.

38:41.258 --> 38:43.959
No one is coming to save us.

38:45.596 --> 38:46.998
Do you understand?

38:47.000 --> 38:49.194
Not Niels Bohr.

38:50.038 --> 38:52.536
And not Reed Akley.

39:04.420 --> 39:07.492
A toast to my friend and teacher.

39:09.727 --> 39:13.164
So many lights have been extinguished

39:14.187 --> 39:16.202
in Europe's dark night.

39:17.905 --> 39:21.604
It is our great fortune
that his still burns brightly

39:21.606 --> 39:23.607
and that he's deigned to share it with us

39:23.609 --> 39:25.142
on this desert promontory.

39:30.414 --> 39:32.349
Hear, hear.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.521
As you prepare to leave us, Niels,

39:40.976 --> 39:43.592
know that your presence
here, fleeting though it was,

39:44.151 --> 39:46.380
lifted our spirits

39:46.662 --> 39:48.360
and strengthened our will.

39:50.195 --> 39:53.095
- Bohr's not staying?
- He can't leave.

40:04.239 --> 40:06.237
Ah.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.809
Dr. Bohr.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.607
Dr. Bohr.

40:18.819 --> 40:20.785
I don't understand.

40:20.787 --> 40:22.855
You just got here.

40:22.857 --> 40:25.894
You have all shown me
such great hospitality,

40:25.896 --> 40:29.198
but I've had too much wine and I
fear I'm not much for dinner theater.

40:29.200 --> 40:31.061
You're not joining the project?

40:31.402 --> 40:35.340
So what is this, just a USO tour?

40:35.911 --> 40:39.009
When soldiers lose morale,
they get pinup girls.

40:39.011 --> 40:41.210
You get a tired old man with a pipe.

40:41.212 --> 40:42.551
But we need you.

40:43.794 --> 40:46.319
Sir, we're trying to end the war.

40:46.321 --> 40:48.588
Earlier today I asked
you, "is it big enough?"

40:49.002 --> 40:50.603
Is it big enough?

40:50.758 --> 40:53.192
20 kilotons, burn radius two miles wide.

40:53.194 --> 40:54.928
If you spotted a flaw in the math...

40:54.930 --> 40:56.930
There was a chemist once in Germany.

40:56.932 --> 40:59.934
He made artificial fertilizer.

40:59.936 --> 41:01.803
And when the last war came,

41:01.805 --> 41:05.307
he thought perhaps I could
fashion my work into a weapon.

41:07.379 --> 41:09.179
Don't shoot. It's Winter.

41:09.181 --> 41:11.247
Fathead.

41:11.249 --> 41:14.618
Some thought it to be so intolerable,

41:14.620 --> 41:18.451
it would discourage any future wars.

41:19.854 --> 41:21.489
But his legacy

41:21.491 --> 41:25.290
is a fog of chlorine gas

41:25.292 --> 41:29.996
that crept over Europe and Africa and Asia.

41:37.601 --> 41:39.668
When I asked "is it big enough",

41:39.670 --> 41:43.670
I meant is it big enough
that no sane person

41:43.672 --> 41:46.206
would ever dare to use it?

41:50.112 --> 41:51.713
I don't know.

41:51.715 --> 41:54.820
Good men invent bigger
and more efficient methods

41:54.822 --> 41:57.324
for humankind to exterminate itself,

41:57.326 --> 42:00.462
hoping the world will
lose its hunger for horror.

42:00.464 --> 42:02.864
But our species seems to have

42:02.866 --> 42:04.712
an insatiable appetite.

42:08.805 --> 42:10.705
I've lost mine.

42:29.889 --> 42:31.890
Enlisted or drafted?

42:33.260 --> 42:34.695
Huh?

42:35.645 --> 42:37.127
Enlisted.

42:38.171 --> 42:40.032
This your first rotation?

42:40.695 --> 42:42.266
Yes, sir.

42:46.069 --> 42:47.837
Go ahead.

42:49.339 --> 42:51.240
Keep your head down.

44:07.556 --> 44:10.276
If we take my car, we'll be
back at the range by 10:00.

44:12.174 --> 44:14.876
I know, we blew our only set of primers.

44:29.953 --> 44:31.952
Pinched them from Akley's lab.

44:38.576 --> 44:40.276
I handle the camera.

45:00.781 --> 45:02.683
It is okay.

45:02.685 --> 45:04.130
Lie still.

45:04.555 --> 45:06.513
They've just signed the armistice.

45:06.755 --> 45:09.289
The war is over.

45:09.777 --> 45:11.624
There will never be another.
